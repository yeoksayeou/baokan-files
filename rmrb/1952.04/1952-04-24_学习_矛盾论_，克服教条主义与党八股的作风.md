    Studying "On Contradiction" to Overcome Dogmatism and the Style of Party Writing
    "Xuexi" (Study) Magazine Editorial Department
    Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Contradiction," like "On Practice," is a combative Marxist-Leninist philosophical work. "On Practice" deals with the relationship between knowledge and practice; "On Contradiction" deals with how to observe and analyze the contradictory movements of various things and how to find methods for resolving contradictions. In elaborating these important philosophical principles of Marxism-Leninism, Comrade Mao Zedong carried out an extremely important task: exposing and opposing the subjective idealism that had seriously harmed the Chinese revolution and teaching us how to overcome it. Dogmatism and empiricism are both manifestations of subjective idealism. These two philosophical works written by Comrade Mao Zedong in 1937 particularly emphasized the criticism of dogmatic thinking.
    In "On Contradiction," Comrade Mao Zedong profoundly and thoroughly explained the interconnectedness of the universality and particularity of contradiction. Solving this problem is fundamentally to "smash those dogmatic ideas that violate the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and are detrimental to our revolutionary cause." Because, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, "Regarding the question of the particularity of contradiction, many comrades, especially dogmatists, do not understand it clearly. They do not understand that the universality of contradiction resides in the particularity of contradiction. They also do not understand how important it is to study the particularity of the contradictions of current concrete things for guiding the development of our revolutionary practice."
    To guide revolutionary practice, we must be good at grasping the problems that arise in revolutionary practice using the principles and methods of Marxism-Leninism and solving these problems. Comrade Mao Zedong said in his speech "Oppose Stereotyped Party Writing": "What is a problem? A problem is the contradiction of things. Where there is an unresolved contradiction, there is a problem." Therefore, so-called grasping and solving problems means discovering contradictions using the principles and methods of Marxism-Leninism, analyzing contradictions, and even resolving contradictions. Dogmatists can only cling to fragments of words in Marxist books; they have never systematically understood Marxism-Leninism, let alone use Marxism-Leninism as a weapon to seriously study the various concrete problems of the Chinese revolution under specific conditions. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "Our dogmatists are lazybones. They refuse to do any arduous research work on concrete things. They regard general truth as something that appears out of thin air and transform it into a purely abstract formula that people cannot grasp." Since dogmatists do not specifically study any specific contradictions, they inevitably become empty talkers detached from practice.
    According to Comrade Mao Zedong's profound analysis, dogmatists do not understand that the universality of contradiction is contained in the particularity of all contradictions, and the commonality of contradiction is contained in the individuality of all contradictions. To overcome dogmatism, we must be good at systematically understanding Marxism-Leninism and use the general principles of Marxism-Leninism to concretely analyze and study the contradictions with vivid particularity that appear in actual life at any time, concretely analyze and study the differences between the principal contradiction and the non-principal contradiction, the principal aspect of the contradiction and the non-principal aspect of the contradiction and their mutual transformation, and concretely analyze and study the identity and struggle of the various aspects of the contradiction and the specific forms of struggle between the various aspects of the contradiction.
    Dogmatists cannot solve any problems. Therefore, what they write and say are just batches of stereotyped platitudes devoid of Marxist-Leninist spirit, devoid of content, and devoid of analysis. Comrade Mao Zedong pointedly pointed out: "Using different methods to solve different contradictions is a principle that Marxists-Leninists must strictly abide by. Dogmatists do not abide by this principle. They do not understand the differences in various revolutionary situations, and therefore they do not understand that different methods should be used to solve different contradictions, but simply use a formula that they believe to be immutable everywhere. This can only lead to setbacks in the revolution or make things that could have been done well very bad." "Our dogmatists violate Lenin's instructions and never use their brains to specifically analyze anything. When writing articles or giving speeches, they are always empty and stereotyped. This has created a very bad style within our Party."
    Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" were written fifteen years ago. After that, in 1941 and 1942, Comrade Mao Zedong also delivered a series of speeches against subjectivism and its manifestation, "stereotyped Party writing." Under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought, subjectivist ideas suffered a fatal blow. Comrade Mao Zedong's adherence to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and his victory over dogmatic and empirical ideas was an important and decisive factor in the Party's leadership of the Chinese revolution to victory over the past fifteen years. However, various forms of subjectivist thought have their petty-bourgeois social basis. Although the main current of subjectivism has been defeated in our Party's leading organs, it may reappear in other conditions and in certain work positions in one form or another. Therefore, we must at all times pay attention to using criticism and self-criticism to overcome dogmatic and empirical tendencies in practical work and theoretical research work. This is a constant struggle task in the Party's ideological work. The re-publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's work "On Contradiction," written fifteen years ago, provides us with a powerful weapon for conducting this criticism and self-criticism.
    In the Party's theoretical research work, it is especially necessary to seriously carry out the struggle against dogmatic thinking. There are two different paths in theoretical research work. One path is, as Comrade Mao Zedong said in "Rectify the Style of Study, the Style of the Party, and the Style of Writing," to "truly understand the essence of Marxism-Leninism, truly understand the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint, and method, and apply it to deeply and scientifically analyze China's actual problems and find out its laws of development." This is also what Comrade Mao Zedong said in "Reform Our Study," "Not relying on subjective imagination, not relying on enthusiasm, not relying on books, but relying on objectively existing facts, 'thoroughly possessing materials,' and drawing correct conclusions from these facts and materials. This conclusion is not a phenomenon arrangement of A, B, C, and D, nor is it an exaggerated and empty article, but a scientific conclusion. This attitude has the meaning of seeking truth from facts, without the intention of sensationalizing." Our Party's theoretical researchers must strive to follow this correct path pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong. Although they may not be able to achieve great achievements in their work immediately, it is clear that anyone who can diligently and conscientiously take this path and do a bit of work will benefit from it and will certainly achieve some success. The other path is just the opposite, relying only on subjective imagination and not on objectively existing facts; the attitude is to sensationalize without seeking truth from facts, and the result will inevitably be exaggerated and empty articles, empty and stereotyped, and will inevitably achieve nothing. Some people in our Party who can do research work, although they verbally oppose dogmatism, do not truly understand the harm of dogmatism, do not truly understand Comrade Mao Zedong's policy, and therefore have not completely gotten rid of this dogmatic and stereotyped style of writing. In some comrades' articles published in "Xuexi" (Study) magazine, there is a very strong dogmatic and stereotyped style of writing.
    After our preliminary examination of the past situation of "Xuexi" (Study) magazine, we feel that although some articles with relatively rich content have been published in this publication, there are indeed many articles that are exaggerated and empty, without concretely analyzing any specific problems. In recent issues, some comrades' articles have made one-sided mistakes on the issue of the bourgeoisie, which is also related to this dogmatic and stereotyped tendency. In terms of not frequently criticizing dogmatism and stereotyped writing, "Xuexi" (Study) magazine has done a very poor job and has made mistakes. Due to the large circulation of "Xuexi" (Study) magazine, our shortcomings and mistakes must have a great impact on readers. The publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's "On Contradiction" has further awakened us, making us feel that we must take an extremely serious attitude to quickly correct our shortcomings and mistakes. The editorial department is now conducting an in-depth examination and will announce the results of the examination to readers. Here, the editorial department of "Xuexi" (Study) magazine deeply hopes to get concrete help from readers; we believe that our readers will definitely be willing to specifically tell the editorial department every mistake they see in this publication to help the editorial department's review.

    学习“矛盾论”，克服教条主义与党八股的作风
    “学习”杂志编辑部
    毛泽东同志的“矛盾论”和“实践论”一样，都是战斗性的马克思列宁主义的哲学著作。“实践论”所处理的是认识与实践的关系的问题；“矛盾论”所处理的是怎样观察与分析各种事物的矛盾的运动，又怎样找到解决矛盾的方法的问题。毛泽东同志在发挥马克思列宁主义的这些重要哲学原理时，贯彻着一个极其重要的任务，就是揭发和反对曾经对于中国革命起了严重的危害作用的主观主义思想，并且教导我们怎样去克服主观主义思想。教条主义和经验主义都是主观主义的表现。毛泽东同志在一九三七年所写的这两篇哲学著作，特别着重地批判了教条主义思想。
    在“矛盾论”中，毛泽东同志深入而周到地说明了矛盾的普遍性和特殊性的相互联系的问题。解决这个问题，就是从根本上“击破违反马克思列宁主义基本原则的不利于我们的革命事业的那些教条主义的思想”。因为，如同毛泽东同志所说的，“关于矛盾的特殊性的问题，则还有很多的同志，特别是教条主义者，弄不清楚。他们不了解矛盾的普遍性即寓于矛盾的特殊性之中。他们也不了解研究当前具体事物的矛盾的特殊性，对于我们指导革命实践的发展有何等重要的意义。”
    指导革命实践，必须善于用马克思列宁主义的原理和方法把握在革命实践中发生的一个个的问题，并解决这些问题。毛泽东同志在“反对党八股”的演说中说：“什么叫问题？问题就是事物的矛盾，那里有没有解决的矛盾，那里就有问题。”因此，所谓把握问题与解决问题，也就是，用马克思列宁主义的原理和方法发现矛盾，分析矛盾以至解决矛盾。教条主义者只能死抱住马克思主义的书本中的片言只语，而并没有系统地理解过马克思列宁主义，更丝毫不会用马克思列宁主义这个武器去认真地研究在具体的条件下的中国革命的各种具体的问题。毛泽东同志说：“我们的教条主义者是懒汉，他们拒绝对于具体事物做任何艰苦的研究工作，他们把一般真理看成是凭空出现的东西，把它变成为人们所不能够捉摸的纯粹抽象的公式。”教条主义者既不具体地研究任何具体的矛盾，就不可免地使自己成为脱离实践的空谈家。
    按照毛泽东同志的深刻的分析，教条主义者不了解矛盾的普遍性包含于一切矛盾的特殊性之中，矛盾的共性包含于一切矛盾的个性之中。克服教条主义，就必须善于有系统地理解马克思列宁主义，并用马克思列宁主义的一般原则去具体地分析和研究在实际生活中随时出现的具有生动的特殊性的矛盾，具体地分析研究主要矛盾和非主要的矛盾，主要的矛盾方面和非主要的矛盾方面之间的区别及其相互转化，具体地分析研究矛盾诸方面间的同一性与斗争性以及矛盾诸方面间的斗争的具体形式。
    教条主义者不能解决任何问题，因而他们所写的东西，所说的言语，只是一批毫无马克思列宁主义气息的、毫无内容的、毫无分析的八股式的油腔滑调。毛泽东同志尖锐地指出：“用不同的方法去解决不同的矛盾，这是马克思列宁主义者必须严格地遵守的一个原则。教条主义者不遵守这个原则，他们不了解诸种革命情况的区别，因而也不了解应当用不同的方法去解决不同的矛盾，而只是千篇一律地使用一种自以为不可改变的公式到处硬套，这就只能使革命遭受挫折，或者将本来做得好的事情弄得很坏。”“我们的教条主义者违背列宁的指示，从来不用脑筋具体地分析任何事物，做起文章或演说来，总是空洞无物的八股调，在我们党内造成了一种极坏的作风。”
    毛泽东同志的“实践论”和“矛盾论”是在十五年前写的。在这以后，在一九四一年及一九四二年，毛泽东同志又发表了一系列的反对主观主义及其表现形式“党八股”的演说。在毛泽东同志的思想指导下，主观主义思想受到了致命的打击。毛泽东同志坚持马克思列宁主义的原则而战胜了教条主义以及经验主义的思想，这是党在这十五年来领导中国革命胜利前进中的一个重要的、而且有决定意义的因素。但是各种形式的主观主义思想是有其小资产阶级的社会基础的。主观主义的主要潮流虽然在我们党的领导机关里面被击败了，但它又可能在其他条件下与在某些工作位置上以这种或那种形式而重新出现。因此我们必须在任何时候注意用批评与自我批评来克服在实际工作上和在理论研究工作上的教条主义和经验主义的倾向。这是党的思想工作中的经常的斗争任务。毛泽东同志在十五年前的著作“矛盾论”的重新发表，提供给我们进行这种批评与自我批评的有力的武器。
    在党的理论研究工作中，尤其要认真进行对教条主义思想的斗争。在理论研究工作中有两条不同的路。一条路是如同毛泽东同志在“整顿学风党风文风”中所说的，“真正领会马列主义的实质，真正领会马列主义的立场、观点与方法，并且应用了它去深刻地、科学地分析中国的实际问题，找出它的发展规律”。这也就是毛泽东同志在“改造我们的学习”中所说的，“不凭主观想像，不凭热情，不凭书本，而凭客观存在的事实，‘详细占有材料’，从这些事实中材料中引出正确的结论。这种结论，不是甲乙丙丁的现象排列，也不是夸夸其谈的滥调文章，而是科学的结论。这种态度，有实事求是之意，无哗众取宠之心。”我们党的理论研究工作者必须努力按照毛泽东同志所指出的这个正确道路走，虽然在工作中不一定马上就能够有如何大的成就，但是显然的，任何人只要能够勤勤勉勉地、切切实实地走这条路，做一分工作就有一分益处，就必定能有一定的成就。另一条路恰恰相反，是只凭主观想像，而不凭客观存在的事实；其态度是有哗众取宠之心，而无实事求是之意，其结果也就必定是夸夸其谈的滥调文章，是空洞无物的八股调，就必定毫无成就。我们党内有一些可以做研究工作的人，虽然口头上反对教条主义，但并没有真正懂得教条主义之危害，没有真正懂得毛泽东同志的方针，因而也就还没有完全摆脱这种教条主义与党八股的作风。在“学习”杂志上所发表的有些同志的文章中，就是带有极其浓厚的教条主义与党八股的作风的。
    我们初步检查“学习”杂志过去的状况，觉得在这刊物上虽然曾发表了一些比较有内容的文章，但属于夸夸其谈，空洞无物的并没有具体地分析什么具体问题的文章，的确是不少的。在最近几期中，有些同志的文章关于资产阶级问题犯有片面性的错误，也和这种教条主义与党八股的倾向有关。就对于教条主义与党八股这种作风没有经常加以批判这方面说，“学习”杂志所做的工作有很大的缺点和错误。由于“学习”杂志的发行数量较大，我们的缺点和错误对于读者的影响也一定是很大的。毛泽东同志的“矛盾论”的发表更唤醒了我们，使我们觉得对于自己的这种缺点和错误必须采取极端严肃的态度迅速地加以纠正。编辑部现正进行深入的检查，并且将把检查的结果向读者宣布。在这里，“学习”杂志编辑部深切地希望得到读者的具体帮助；相信我们的读者一定愿意把你们所看到的这刊物上的每一个错误具体地告诉编辑部，以帮助编辑部的检讨。
