    To the Editorial Department:
    Regarding the criticism published in the "Letters from Readers" column of the People's Daily on April 3rd, concerning our court's (Outer District People's Court of Beijing) resident tribunal in the Ninth District (the original letter mistakenly referred to it as the Ninth District People's Court of Beijing) for delaying the handling of the case filed by the Anlao Institute of the Production and Education Center of Beijing against the unscrupulous merchant Wang Yinwu for breach of contract, we have conducted an inspection. Our court completed all transfer procedures on April 1st and sent the case to the Municipal People's Court.
    Upon inspection, we found that there were no delays from the time we accepted the case until the two summons and the decision to transfer it to the Municipal People's Court. Our errors occurred during the transfer process: (1) On March 24th, when the clerk of our court's resident tribunal in the Ninth District, Xie Rongzhong (the original letter mistakenly referred to him as Comrade Xue, the person in charge), heard the Anlao Institute comrade's opinion expressed over the phone, "If you cannot transfer the case quickly, we will directly file a lawsuit with the Municipal People's Court," he did not patiently explain the situation in detail. Nor did he expedite the transfer afterward. This shows that in our work, we did not prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency and handle this case promptly. This procrastination indicates that we are not sufficiently responsible to the people. (2) During the second submission of the draft, the draft was shelved for seven or eight days because the president of our court was conducting "Five-Anti" blitz work in the Sixth District, and it was not approved in a timely manner. Consequently, this case was not transferred promptly, which is also a form of delay. We will definitely pay attention to correcting this in our future work.
    The criticism from the Anlao Institute comrades is very helpful in improving our work, and we welcome it very much. We hope to receive more help from you at any time in the future.
    The Outer District People's Court of Beijing

    北京市外城区人民法院
    关于拖延处理安老所控告奸商王荫梧案的检查
    编辑同志：四月三日人民日报读者来信栏登载了北京市生产教养院安老所对我院驻第九区审判庭
    （原信误为北京市第九区人民法院）拖延处理控告奸商王荫梧违反合同一案的批评，我们已经作了检查。我院已在四月一日办妥一切转递手续，将该案送往市人民法院。
    经我们检查，我们受理该案以后，直到两次传讯，决定移送市人民法院的过程中，并没有拖延的情形。我们的错误是在办理移送的过程中：（一）三月二十四日，我院驻第九区审判庭书记员谢容众
    （原信误为负责人薛同志）在电话中听到安老所同志提出的“既不能很快的转案子，我们直接向市人民法院起诉了”的意见时，没有耐心详细地予以解释。事后也没有急速移送。这说明我们在工作上，没有分别轻重缓急，及时处理此案：这种拖拉作风表示我们对人民不够负责。（二）第二次文稿送核时，由于我院院长在第六区作“五反”突击工作，把文稿搁置七、八天，未能及时批核，因而此案没有被及时移送，也是一种拖延现象。我们今后在工作中一定注意纠正。
    安老所同志的批评，对改进我们的工作有很大帮助，我们非常欢迎。今后希望随时给我们更多的帮助。　北京市外城区人民法院
