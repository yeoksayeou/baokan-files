    An Epic of Socialist Revolution and Construction
    ——Recommending the Films "Lenin in October," "Lenin in 1918," and "The Vow"
    Tang Jie
    In commemoration of the 82nd anniversary of Lenin's birth, the three films "Lenin in October," "Lenin in 1918," and "The Vow" are being re-released in our country one after another. These three epic films, which form a continuous series, centrally reflect the true face of the great October Socialist Revolution and the struggle and construction of the Soviet people. They profoundly and vividly recreate the supreme examples of the leaders of the proletarian revolution, Lenin and Stalin, depicting their multifaceted activities. This is an outstanding result of the joint labor of the most excellent film artists in the Soviet Union. The authors of "Lenin in October" and "Lenin in 1918" said: "The art world has never known a task as difficult and as pleasant as recreating the genius of mankind, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. People have never guarded an image with such concern, so as not to allow the slightest distortion of it in the work of art. People have never appreciated every successful depiction with such joy and gratitude." [Note 1] The author of "The Vow" said: "As soon as Stalin's name is mentioned, people's hearts are filled with ardent love. All those fortunate enough to have personally met this great figure of modern times are filled with tears of joy and happiness. Then, what should an artist who resolutely wants to express in art the image of this great Stalin, who belongs to contemporaries, to history, and to future generations, feel?..." [Note 2] The Soviet artists created these films with such feelings.
    The stories of the three films are all Soviet historical facts. "Lenin in October" depicts how Lenin and his closest comrade-in-arms, Stalin, regardless of the opposition of traitors, resolutely led the armed uprising of workers, peasants, and soldiers, overthrew the bourgeois government that was under the protection of foreign imperialism and advocated carrying the imperialist war to the end, established the Soviet regime, and created the world's first socialist country. "Lenin in 1918" focuses on the event of Lenin being seriously wounded by assassination, and unfolds the fierce struggle to defend the Soviet regime. What was the situation at that time? "British interventionist troops attacked northern Soviet Union, Japanese interventionist troops were carrying out massacres in the Far East, and Turkish troops attacked cities in southern Russia. Czechoslovak prisoners of war ignited the poisonous flames of rebellion in the center of the Soviet Republic, Cossack generals approached Tsaritsyn, attempting to join forces with the Czechoslovak troops. In Moscow, the heart of the Republic, the 'Left' Socialist-Revolutionaries launched an uprising. The Soviet Republic bled, suffered the torment of war, and was suffocated by the poisonous hand of hunger." [Note 3] In Lenin's office, the telegraph machine kept ringing. All the telegrams were about grain, grain, grain; about landlord uprisings, about urgent demands from the front lines. The thoughts and hopes of the fighting people flowed to Lenin, but Lenin was wounded by assassination by counter-revolutionaries. Under the education and leadership of Lenin, the Party and the Soviet people, and the great Red Army under the personal command of Stalin, finally quickly crushed the crazy attacks of domestic and foreign enemies and marched forward irresistibly, "to drive those who hindered the people, those who dared to raise their hands against the people's most beloved person—their leader—forever out of the Soviet land!" [Note 4] And Lenin, who was seriously wounded by the assassination, also recovered his health. "The Vow" unfolds the construction activities of implementing the first Stalin Five-Year Plan and the incredibly cruel war of resistance against the German invaders, starting with Stalin's vow before Lenin's remains in 1924. Stalin's solemn oath immediately became the action program of the people of the whole country, and Lenin's will was fully realized.
    Through vivid artistic images, the three films very prominently express the flesh-and-blood connection between these two revolutionary leaders and the broad masses of working people. Lenin and Stalin on the screen, just like Lenin and Stalin in real life and actual struggle, cherished and trusted the people so much, understood the suffering and hopes of the people so profoundly, and served the revolutionary cause of the people with all their hearts, that the people naturally dedicated their infinite love and trust to them. In "Lenin in October," we see countless workers and peasants inquiring about Lenin's news, wanting to see him, and imagining him as a particularly tall and extraordinary figure. The worker Vasily and his wife guarded Lenin, who was sleeping on the floor, with their guns all night long. The woman did not know that this was Lenin, but she guessed it somewhat. Her indescribable gaze sweeping over Lenin's bed reflected the love and hope of the entire working class and all working people for their leader. In "Lenin in 1918," we see that after the car carrying Lenin, who was seriously wounded by the assassination, drove away, "the masses stood motionless, looking at the shadow of the car. The masses were no longer stuck together, no longer active - as if a piece of flesh had been torn away." [Note 5] In "The Vow," we see a group of workers and peasants who were complaining to Lenin and seeking help. When they heard the news of Lenin's death halfway, even the little girl Orika cried in her mother's arms. However, Lenin did not die; he lived forever in the hearts of the people. After refusing to write an article mourning Lenin for the newspaper, Comrade Stalin said to the newspaper reporter: "If it is necessary, publish my article celebrating his fiftieth birthday. People like Lenin do not die. He lived in our hearts in the past and will live in our hearts forever in the future!" [Note 6] Lenin, who lived forever in the hearts of the people, immediately recommended Stalin to the people to inherit his cause. When the old woman Varvara walked to Lenin's remains with solemn steps and handed Stalin, who was taking the oath, the letter written to Lenin by her husband before he was killed by the landlord, "the entire Red Square raised its hands, as if saying: 'Please accept it! This letter is for you. Today, you are our Lenin.'" [Note 7]
    Lenin and Stalin, who loved the people and the people's revolutionary cause, hated the enemies of the people in various guises so much that they advocated resolutely sanctioning them. In "Lenin in 1918," Lenin said to Poliyevkov: "...Now listen: No matter what revolutionary work they have done in the past, no matter how much work they have done for the Party in the past, no matter how old they are, we cannot consider it. Absolutely not - if they do things that harm the Soviet regime. We will never allow those gentlemen to hinder our work under the protection of the kind Poliyevkov..." [Note 8] When Lenin introduced an orphan to Stalin, Stalin gently stroked her little head and said to Lenin, "For her sake, we must be ruthless to the enemy." From this soil of common love and hate and common belief, the special fighting friendship between Lenin and Stalin grew. Every time these two revolutionary giants appear on the screen together, they give us endless power. The wreath before Lenin's remains made our hearts feel heavy, but when Stalin marched steadily in the blizzard, we saw Lenin resurrected again.
    Under the teachings of Lenin and Stalin, and in the cruel struggle against domestic and foreign enemies, the Soviet people have undergone the most rigorous tests. The Communist Party members represented by Vasily and the non-Party masses represented by Varvara were all closely united under Lenin's banner, united around Stalin, and dedicated everything they had to the socialist motherland. When we see Vasily, who has just transported two trains of grain from Tsaritsyn, suddenly fainting from hunger beside Lenin, and when we see Varvara, who dedicated her children's lives, fighting the enemy with a gun in the Battle of Stalingrad, what do we feel? Thousands upon thousands of Soviet children are such selfless and courageous heroes who are good at killing the enemy! After Lenin was assassinated, he said to Vasily: "Comrade Vasily... I... individually... express my gratitude to you." After the Soviet Union won a decisive victory in the Patriotic War, Stalin said to Varvara in the hall of the Kremlin: "Thank you, Varvara Mikhailovna. I thank you on behalf of the motherland." He continued: "Yes, we have fulfilled our vow, entirely because you and other millions of Soviet mothers have raised those outstanding sons. The blood shed by our people has yielded great results. Mankind will never forget that it was our people who gave them freedom."
    We Chinese people feel particularly close to these films, which everywhere remind us of our people's great leader Comrade Mao Zedong and remind us of the past and future of our own country. The historical victory of the Chinese people's revolution is inseparable from the great doctrines of Lenin and Stalin, and is inseparable from the victory of the great October Revolution and the success of Soviet socialist construction. We have received profound education and been infinitely encouraged by these films. We should train ourselves to be Lenin and Stalin-style fighters, and advance under the guidance of Comrade Mao Zedong, advance!

    社会主义的革命和建设的史诗
    ——推荐影片“列宁在十月”、“列宁在一九一八”和“宣誓”
    唐介
    为了纪念列宁八十二周年诞辰，“列宁在十月”、“列宁在一九一八”和“宣誓”三部影片重新在我国陆续放映了。这三部有连续性的史诗，集中地反映了伟大的十月社会主义革命和苏维埃人民的斗争和建设的真面貌，深刻而生动地再现了无产阶级革命领袖的最高典型列宁和斯大林的形象，描绘了他们的多方面的活动。这是苏联最优秀的电影艺术家们共同劳作的卓越成果。“列宁在十月”和“列宁在一九一八”的作者说：“艺术界从不知道有什么工作像再现人类的天才弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁的工作那么困难，那么愉快。人们从没有这样关切地守护着一个形象，不让他在艺术品里有丝毫的歪曲。人们从没有带着这样的欢欣和感激鉴赏着每一笔成功的描写。”〔注一〕“宣誓”的作者说：“只要一提到斯大林底名字，人们底心里就充满了热烈的爱情。凡是能有幸运亲自和这位现代伟大人物见过面的人，都是满眼饱含着快乐和欢欣的眼泪。那么，一个毅然决然想在艺术中表现这位既属于同时代者、又属于历史、也属于后代人的名字——伟大斯大林底形象底艺术家，究竟应当感觉到些什么呢？……”〔注二〕苏联的艺术家们是以这样的心情来制作这些影片的。
    三部影片的故事都是苏联的史实。“列宁在十月”描写列宁及其最亲密的战友斯大林怎样不顾叛徒们的反对，决然领导工农兵的武装起义，推翻了在外国帝国主义的卵翼下、主张把帝国主义战争进行到底的资产阶级政府，建立了苏维埃政权，创造了世界上第一个社会主义国家。“列宁在一九一八”以列宁被刺重伤事件为中心，展开了保卫苏维埃政权的激烈斗争。当时局势是怎样的呢？“英国干涉军进攻苏联北部，日本干涉军正在远东进行大屠杀，土耳其军队进攻南俄各城市。捷克斯拉夫的俘虏们在苏维埃共和国的中心燃起暴动的毒焰，哥萨克将军们进逼察里津，企图跟捷克斯拉夫军队会合。在共和国的心脏莫斯科，‘左派’社会革命党人起了暴动。苏维埃共和国流了血，受了战争的苦刑，又被饥饿的毒手扼得转不过气来。”〔注三〕在列宁的办公处，电报机不停地响着。一切电报都是关于粮食、粮食、粮食；关于地主暴动，关于前线的迫切的要求。战斗着的民众的思想和希望，都向列宁流来，可是列宁却被反革命分子刺伤了。在列宁教育和领导下的党和苏维埃人民，在斯大林亲自指挥下的伟大红军，终于迅速粉碎了国内外敌人的疯狂进攻，无可抗拒地往前行进，“把那些阻碍民众的人们，那些敢于举手反对民众最亲爱的人——他们的领袖——的人们永远赶出苏维埃的国土！”〔注四〕而被刺重伤的列宁也恢复了健康。“宣誓”是以一九二四年斯大林在列宁灵前宣誓为起点而展开实践第一个斯大林五年计划的建设活动和残酷无比的抵抗德寇的卫国战争。斯大林的庄严的誓言，立刻变成了全国人民的行动纲领，列宁的遗嘱全部实现了。
    三部影片通过鲜明的艺术形象，非常突出地表现了这两位革命领袖和广大劳动人民的血肉联系。银幕上的列宁和斯大林，正如在实际生活和实际斗争中的列宁和斯大林一样，那样爱护人民，信任人民，那样深刻地理解人民的疾苦和希望，那样全心全意地为人民的革命事业服务，人民便自然而然地也把自己无限的热爱和信任献给了他们。在“列宁在十月”里，我们看到无数工人和农民纷纷探听列宁的消息，想看看他，把他想像作特别魁梧奇伟的人物。工人华西里夫妇带着手枪通夜不眠地守护着睡在地板上的列宁，女的不知道这就是列宁，但又猜到了几分。她那扫射在列宁铺位上的无法形容的目光，反映了整个工人阶级和一切劳动人民对自己领袖的热爱和希望。在“列宁在一九一八”里，我们看到载着被刺重伤的列宁的汽车开走以后，“群众一动不动，望着汽车的后影。群众不再粘在一起了，不再活动了——好像被撕去了一块肉似的。”〔注五〕在“宣誓”里，我们看到一队向列宁诉苦求援的工人和农民在半途听到列宁的死耗时，连小女孩奥立卡都抱着母亲痛哭了。然而列宁并没有死，他是永远活在人民的心里的。斯大林同志在拒绝给报纸写追悼列宁的文章后对报馆记者说：“假使一定要的话，就把我庆祝他五十寿辰的文章登出来。像列宁那样的人是不死的。他过去是生存在我们的心里，将来也永远生存在我们的心里！”〔注六〕这永远活在人民心里的列宁，立刻向人民推荐了斯大林来继承他的事业。当老妇人瓦尔瓦拉以庄严的步伐走到列宁的灵前，把被地主杀害的丈夫在死前写给列宁的信，交给正在宣誓的斯大林时，“整个红场都把手举了起来，好像说：‘请收下吧！这封信就是给你的。今天的你，就是我们的列宁。’”〔注七〕
    热爱人民、热爱人民的革命事业的列宁和斯大林，对穿着各种外衣的人民公敌，是那样深恶痛绝，主张坚决加以制裁。在“列宁在一九一八”里，列宁对波尔耶珂夫说：“……现在听着：不管过去做过什么革命的劳作，不管过去替党做过多少工作，不管年纪多么大，我们都不能加以考虑。绝对不能——如果他们做出损害苏维埃政权的事情。我们决不容许那些绅士在仁慈的波尔耶珂夫同志的卵翼下妨碍我们的工作。……”〔注八〕当列宁把一个孤儿介绍给斯大林时，斯大林温柔地抚摩着她的小小头颅，对列宁说：“为了她的缘故，我们对付敌人必须铁面无情。”就从这种共同爱憎和共同信念的土壤里，长出了列宁和斯大林的特殊战斗友谊。这两位革命巨人每次一同出现在银幕上的时候，都给我们以无穷无尽的力量。列宁灵前的花圈使我们的心头感到沉重，但当斯大林在暴风雪中稳步前进的时候，我们又看见列宁复活了。
    在列宁和斯大林的教导下，在和国内外敌人的残酷斗争中，苏联人民经过了最严格的考验。以华西里为代表的共产党员群众和以瓦尔瓦拉为代表的非党群众，都紧紧团结在列宁的旗帜下，团结在斯大林的周围，把自己的一切都献给了社会主义祖国。当我们看到刚从察里津运来两列车粮食的华西里，突然饿得昏倒在列宁身边的时候，看到献出自己儿女的生命的瓦尔瓦拉，在斯大林格勒保卫战中持枪跟敌人格斗的时候，我们有怎样的感觉呢？千千万万的苏维埃儿女，都是这样公而忘私、勇于杀敌的英雄！列宁被刺后对华西里说：“华西里同志……我……单独……向你表示感谢。”斯大林在卫国战争获得决定性的胜利后，在克里姆林宫的大厅里对瓦尔瓦拉说：“谢谢你，瓦尔瓦拉·米哈伊洛夫娜。我代表祖国向你致谢。”他接着又说：“是的，我们履行了我们的誓言，这完全因为你和其他千千万万苏维埃底母亲抚养了那些杰出的儿子。我们人民所流的血得到了伟大的收获。人类将永远不会忘记是我们人民使他们获得了自由。”
    我们中国人民对这些影片特别感到亲切，它们处处使我们联想到我国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志，想起自己祖国的过去和未来。中国人民革命的历史性胜利，是跟列宁、斯大林的伟大学说分不开的，是跟伟大的十月革命的胜利和苏联社会主义建设的成功分不开的。我们从这些影片得到深刻的教育，受到无限的鼓励。我们应该把自己锻炼成列宁、斯大林式的战士，在毛泽东同志的引导下前进，前进！
