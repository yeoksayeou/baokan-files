Cultural Briefs
    ▲ The "Script" monthly magazine, edited by the All-China Drama Workers Association, published a "Special Issue on Anti-Corruption and Anti-Theft" (combined issue of February and March) on March 20th; it selected and published four plays: Song Zhidi's "Accusation," Lao She's "Birthday," Lü Fei and Qiao Yu's "The Mayor's Representative Has Arrived," and Wang Mingfu's "Always Be Vigilant." "Accusation" exposes the heinous crimes of traitorous merchants who harmed the Chinese People's Volunteers. The play depicts how illegal capitalists, when contracting to produce emergency medical kits for the Chinese People's Volunteers, disregarded the interests of the motherland and the people, and frantically harmed our most beloved people, and used despicable means to sabotage the "Five-Anti" movement; but under the powerful counterattack of the working class, the traitorous merchants were finally sanctioned by the people. (This play has been rehearsed by the Literary and Art Troupe of the General Political Department of the Central People's Government Revolutionary Military Commission and will be performed in Beijing soon.)
    "Birthday" and "The Mayor's Representative Has Arrived" show that the people of Beijing have universally raised their political consciousness in the anti-corruption and anti-theft movement. Men and women, young and old, responded to the government's call and actively participated in the movement, causing the corrupt and thieving criminals with serious crimes to fall into the people's net one after another.
    "Always Be Vigilant" exposes the vicious attacks of illegal capitalists in contracting the construction project of workers' dormitories through the struggle between positive characters and traitorous merchants, illustrating that if the bourgeoisie's attacks are not repelled for a day, the national construction cannot be done well for a day, and the workers' lives cannot be improved for a day.
    ▲ The Central Academy of Drama's affiliated Song and Dance Theater began performing the opera "Strike the Aggressors" (i.e., "Eliminate the Aggressors," written by Song Zhidi, Ding Yi, and Wei Wei) in Beijing on March 27th. The content of the play depicts the situation of the Chinese People's Volunteers fighting abroad. It shows the noble qualities of the Volunteers and their revolutionary heroism based on patriotism and internationalism, and also shows the strong and unyielding patriotic actions and invincible strength of the Korean people and the Korean army. Before the performance, the play's directing team collected relevant news reports and other documents and pictures about the Korean battlefield, organized actors to conduct research, and allowed the actors to live a strict military life, conduct military training, field practice, and live ammunition shooting, etc. Later, the actors were also organized to go to Korea and to the Volunteer Army units to experience life. The performance of this play will enable the broad masses of the audience to more clearly understand how our "most beloved people" are fighting to the death in Korea, how bravely and tenaciously they are striking the aggressors, and how unbreakable the friendship they have forged with the Korean people in the battle is.

    ▲中华全国戏剧工作者协会编辑的“剧本”月刊于三月二十日出版了“反贪污、反盗窃专号”（二、三月号合刊）；选刊了宋之的的“控诉”、老舍的“生日”、逯斐、乔羽的“市长的代表来了”、王命夫的“时刻警惕着”四个话剧。“控诉”揭露了背叛祖国的奸商暗害中国人民志愿军的滔天罪行。该剧描写违法资本家在承制中国人民志愿军的救急药包时，不顾祖国和人民的利益，丧心病狂地暗害我们最可爱的人，并以卑鄙的手段破坏“五反”运动；但在工人阶级强大的反击下，奸商终于受到人民的制裁。（该剧已由中央人民政府人民革命军事委员会总政治部文艺工作团排演，将于最近在北京演出。）
    “生日”和“市长的代表来了”是表现北京市民在反贪污、反盗窃的运动中，普遍提高了政治觉悟，男女老幼都响应政府号召，积极地参加了运动，使罪恶重大的贪污犯、盗窃犯，纷纷落入人民的法网。
    “时刻警惕着”是通过正面人物和奸商的斗争，揭露违法资本家在承包工人宿舍建筑工程中的恶毒进攻，说明一天不把资产阶级的进攻打退，国家建设便一天不能搞好，工人生活也一天不能改善。
    ▲中央戏剧学院附属歌舞剧院于三月二十七日开始在北京演出歌剧“打击侵略者”（即“消灭侵略者”，宋之的、丁毅、魏巍编剧）。该剧的内容是描写我国人民志愿军出国作战的情形的，它表现了志愿军高贵的品质和在爱国主义、国际主义基础上的革命英雄主义精神，也表现了朝鲜人民、朝鲜军队坚强不屈的爱国行动和不可战胜的力量。在演出前，该剧导演团曾收集有关朝鲜战场的通讯报道及其他文件、图片，组织演员进行研究，并让演员过着严格的军事生活，进行军事实习、野外实习、实弹射击等。以后，还组织演员到朝鲜，到志愿军部队中去体验生活。这个戏的演出将使广大观众更明确地认识我们“最可爱的人”怎样在朝鲜出生入死地作战，怎样英勇顽强地打击侵略者，以及他们在战斗中和朝鲜人民结成的友谊是如何的牢不可破。
