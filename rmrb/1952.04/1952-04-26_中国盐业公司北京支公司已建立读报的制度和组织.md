To the Editors: The "Reader's Letters" column of the People's Daily published a letter on March 29th criticizing our company's cadres for neglecting to read the newspaper. This criticism is entirely correct. While carrying out the "Three-Anti" movement and also attending to our business, we have indeed neglected the work of leading all cadres in reading the newspaper. We have not set aside a specific time to organize staff to read the newspaper, and some comrades only give the newspaper a cursory glance, while most people do not read it at all. This phenomenon exists not only among general staff but also among some responsible comrades. For example, our company's Deputy Manager, Comrade Wang Jinchen, also admitted in his self-criticism that he "himself neglected reading the newspaper." This neglect of reading the newspaper is serious. Why did we neglect reading and studying the newspaper during the "Three-Anti" movement? This is mainly because we did not realize that the newspaper is a weapon to guide actual struggle and did not use this powerful weapon to enrich our ideological leadership of the work.

The newspaper's criticism has helped us greatly. Since March 31st, under the leadership of the Party branch, we have resumed one and a half hours of study time every morning and have organized newspaper reading. Currently, comrades have begun to value reading and studying the newspaper, and many are paying attention to reading and discussing important issues in the newspaper during their free time. On April 7th, we held a quiz about reading and studying the newspaper, and the majority of people passed. On April 10th, the Trade Union Preparatory Committee held a meeting and decided to restore the organization of past newspaper reading groups, centered on each trade union group, and establish a regular newspaper reading system. This work is currently underway.

### 中国盐业公司北京支公司已建立读报的制度和组织

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    中国盐业公司北京支公司已建立读报的制度和组织
    编辑同志：三月二十九日，人民日报“读者来信”栏发表了批评我公司干部忽视读报的来信，这一批评是完全正确的。我们在开展“三反”运动并兼顾业务的同时，对于领导全体干部读报的工作的确是忽视了。我们没有抽出一定的时间来组织工作人员读报，有些同志对于报纸只是粗粗地浏览一下，甚至大部分人竟根本没有读报。这种现象不只在一般工作人员中存在，在一部分负责同志中也是存在的。如我公司副经理王荩臣同志在检讨中也承认“本身也是忽视了读报的”。这种忽视读报的现象是严重的。为什么在“三反”运动中，我们忽视了读报学习呢？这主要是因为我们没有认识到报纸是指导实际斗争的武器，没有运用这个有力武器去丰富对工作的思想领导。
    报纸的批评给了我们很大帮助。三月三十一日起，在党支部的领导下，我们已恢复了每天早晨一小时半的学习时间，并且组织了读报学习。目前，同志们对读报学习已重视起来，不少人在空闲时间都注意阅读和讨论报纸上的重要问题了。四月七日，我们举行了一次关于读报学习的临时测验，结果大部分人都能及格。四月十日，工会筹委会开会决定：以各工会小组为中心，恢复过去的读报小组的组织，建立经常的读报学习制度。这一工作现正进行中。
