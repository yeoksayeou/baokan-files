To the Editor:

    Our village's Communist Party members, in order to increase the unit area yield this year, have patiently conducted propaganda and education work among the peasants, and have broken conservative thinking and solved the problem of increasing fertilizer.

    When we mobilized the masses to buy more fine fertilizer, we encountered the following ideological situations: (1) Yao Fude, who adhered to empiricism, said: "I have already applied 3,000 catties of base fertilizer per mu this year, and I can't apply any more, otherwise it will break the flower leaves and reduce the harvest instead"; (2) Some farmers emphasized that they had no money to buy fertilizer and did not want to find ways; (3) Others were afraid of "sticking out and showing off their wealth." They clearly applied more fertilizer and harvested more grain, but they followed others in saying, "I haven't seen that adding more fertilizer can increase the harvest by three or four times."

    In response to the above ideological situations, we studied specific solutions: For farmers with the first type of thinking, we used the actual example of Li Huagui applying more fertilizer and strengthening technical management, resulting in a yield of 700 catties of wheat per mu, to educate them; for farmers with the second type of thinking, we used specific accounting methods to open up their minds and mobilize them to turn dead objects into living objects and buy fine fertilizer for agricultural production; for people with the third type of thinking, we compared the good and bad of the new and old societies, carried out patriotic education to improve their political awareness, and told them that the government is now rewarding production, so don't worry about "sticking out."

    We used Party and Youth League members as the backbone and used various propaganda methods to conduct propaganda in primary schools, people's schools, street restaurants, and various occasions. Finally, we held a village-wide mass meeting, where the branch secretary made a mobilization report; and group discussions were launched, and typical speakers were selected to report on the methods to solve the fertilizer problem. This kind of mass discussion was very enlightening to the masses. For example, Yao Fude said: "After this education, I realized that I must overcome conservative thinking in production in order to develop production. I still have 300 catties of ginned cotton, and now I will sell it all to buy fertilizer. In addition to my own use, this fertilizer will also be supplied to our mutual aid group. At the same time, I will also mobilize my wife to sell all the silver jewelry she has saved for twenty years and put the money into agricultural production to buy fertilizer." He Huaizhong, a middle peasant who often complained about financial difficulties, said: "I still have five shi of wheat and one hundred bowls, and I will sell them tomorrow to buy fine fertilizer." Party member Guo Fengchun said: "I am responsible for doing a good job in the high-yield work in my natural village." He also guaranteed to find several workers who work outside the village in Zhanghe and borrow 6 million yuan from them to solve the fertilizer purchase problem for some farmers. Now the farmers in our village are selling cotton, jewelry, and tobacco leaves to buy fertilizer. As of April 7, the farmers in our village have bought 200,000 catties of fine fertilizer, and the fertilizer purchase movement is still in full swing. We deeply feel that it is necessary to carry out in-depth propaganda and education to mobilize farmers to increase the application of fertilizer. We are introducing our village's experience here for the reference of other places.

### 郭王度村党员对农民进行教育  打破保守思想解决增肥问题

    郭王度村党员对农民进行教育
    打破保守思想解决增肥问题
    编辑同志：俺村全体共产党员，为了提高今年单位面积产量，向农民耐心地进行了宣传教育工作，已经打破了保守思想，解决了增加肥料问题。
    我们在动员群众大量购买细肥时，曾经碰到下列几种思想情况：（一）经验主义的姚富德说：“我今年每亩地已上了三千斤底肥，不能再上肥了，否则会把花叶攻破，反减少收成”；（二）有的农民强调没钱购买肥料，不想办法；（三）另有一种人怕“冒尖露富”，他明明多上了肥料多打了粮食，却跟着别人说：“没看见过多加肥料能增加三四倍的收成。”
    针对以上思想情况，我们研究了具体解决的办法：对有第一种思想的农民，我们就用李花贵多施肥，加强技术管理，结果麦子每亩收七百斤的实际事例来教育；对有第二类思想的农民，我们就用具体算账的方法，打通他们的思想，动员他们以死物变活物，买细肥投入农业生产；对有第三类思想的人，则给他对比新旧社会的好坏，并进行爱国主义的教育，提高他们的政治觉悟，告诉他们，现在政府是奖励生产的，不要顾虑“冒尖”。
    我们以党、团员为骨干，利用各种宣传方式，在小学、民校、街头饭市及各种场合进行了宣传。最后，我们又召开了全村群众大会，由支部书记作动员报告；并分组展开讨论，选出典型发言人，报告解决肥料问题的办法。这种群众性的讨论，对群众启发很大，如姚富德说：“经过这次教育，我认识到必须克服生产上的保守思想，才能发展生产。我还存有皮棉三百斤，现在我要全部卖了，买成肥料。这些肥料除自用外，还要供给我们的互助组应用。同时我还要动员我老婆把二十年前存的银首饰全部卖了，买肥料投到农业生产上去。”经常喊经济困难的中农贺怀中表示：“我还存着五石小麦及
    一百个碗，明天我就卖了买成细肥。”党员郭凤春说：“我负责把俺这个自然村的丰产工作搞好。”他并保证到漳河北找几个在村外做工的工人，向他们借六百万元来解决部分农民的购肥问题。现在俺村农民纷纷卖棉、卖手饰、卖烟叶买肥料。到四月七日止，俺村农民已买到细肥二十万斤，现在购肥运动还在热烈展开中。我们深深感到，要动员农民增施肥料，也是需要深入进行宣传教育的。我们在这里把我村的经验介绍出来，以供其他各地的参考。
