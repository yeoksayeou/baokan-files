Xinhua News Agency Report: In the first stage of the "Five-Anti" movement in Shanghai, seventy-four private factories and shops that underwent investigation have shown new vitality in production since the conclusion of their cases. Workers are actively producing, and capitalists are managing with peace of mind. The workers' current enthusiasm for labor is unprecedented in the three years since liberation. During the "Five-Anti" inspection period, they continued production and maintained business as usual, completing production tasks on schedule. Some factories even intensified production after the inspection concluded, rapidly increasing output. For example, the average spindle draft of Qixin Yarn Factory during the "Five-Anti" inspection period was 1.068 pounds from March 19th to 24th, increasing to 1.075 pounds from March 25th to 31st. After the inspection conclusion, it further increased to 1.081 pounds from April 1st to 3rd. On April 2nd, the spindle draft even reached the highest record since the factory's liberation, reaching 1.101 pounds. After the "Five-Anti" movement, many factory workers are striving to complete new state processing tasks on schedule or ahead of schedule.

	Mutual assistance among workers in the seventy-four factories and shops during production has become very common after the "Five-Anti" movement, which was rare in the past. On March 31st, the Merlin Canned Food Factory needed to ship out a large number of stocks. Workers from various departments, including the workshop, canning room, water heating room, meat room, cooking room, soldering room, and furnace room, including car drivers who usually did not care about "other people's business," all pitched in. They packaged 1,400 boxes of food (48 cans per box) in one day. This result was twice as high as in the past. Grassroots trade unions and worker representatives in many factories are now studying how to establish various necessary systems for production, effectively inspect finished products, and urge capitalists to formulate production plans to avoid blind production and prevent capitalists from committing "five poisons" crimes again.

	The revolutionary enthusiasm and political interest of workers in various factories and shops have also greatly increased during the "Five-Anti" movement. They are further organizing themselves. Many workers are asking to join the Chinese Communist Party or the Communist Youth League. More than twenty young workers from the Baofuji Steel Construction Factory have applied to join the League, and seventeen of them have been approved by the district League working committee. Some factories that originally had no League organizations, young workers have repeatedly applied to the district League working committee to join the League and requested to establish League organizations in the factory. At the same time, due to the increased revolutionary enthusiasm and political interest of the workers, trade union work has also been smoothly carried out. Trade union activities in many factories have become active after the "Five-Anti" movement. Reading groups and cultural learning groups have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. For example, the Huaxin Stationery and Instrument Factory only had trade union groups before the "Five-Anti" movement. After the "Five-Anti" movement, a trade union preparatory committee was established, three trade union groups and three reading groups were formed, a wall newspaper of the trade union group was published, and plans are being actively made to set up a medicine box and establish a mutual aid savings society.

	The capitalists of these seventy-four factories and shops, in addition to generally participating in the second battle of the "Five-Anti" movement and striving to atone for their crimes, have also settled down in production and business. Under the constant supervision and hard work of the workers, their confidence in management has also increased compared to before the "Five-Anti" movement, and many people are formulating future business plans. They can also often consult with trade unions and worker representatives when dealing with various issues in production and management.

    上海市七十四家私营工厂商店
    检查定案后生产呈现新气象
    职工劳动热情高涨资本家经营信心增强
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：上海市“五反”运动第一战役中受到检查的七十四家私营工厂、商号在总结定案后，职工积极生产，资本家安心经营。职工们目前劳动热情之高，为解放后三年来所少见。在“五反”检查期中，他们都照常生产，维持营业，如期完成生产任务。其中有些工厂的职工更在检查定案后加强生产，迅速地提高了生产量。例如启新纱厂在“五反”检查期间的平均锭扯，在三月十九日到二十四日是一点零六八磅，二十五日到三十一日提高到一点零七五磅；检查总结后，四月一日到三日又提高到一点零八一磅，其间四月二日一天锭扯更创该厂解放以来的最高纪录，达一点一零一磅。“五反”后许多工厂的职工正在努力争取如期或提前完成为国家加工制货的新任务。
    七十四家工厂、商号的职工们在生产中的互助，“五反”后非常普遍，这也是过去所少见的。三月三十一日，梅林罐头食品厂需要运出大批存货，工作场、制罐间、水汀间、肉食间、烹调间、焊锡间、炉子间等各部门职工，连一向不管“闲事”的汽车司机在内一齐动手，一天内就包装好食品一千四百箱（每箱装四十八听）。这个成绩比过去高出两倍。许多工厂的基层工会和工人代表，现在正在研究今后如何建立生产上的各种必要制度，有效地检验生产成品，并且督促资方拟订生产计划，避免盲目生产，防止资方再犯“五毒”罪行。
    各工厂、商号职工们的革命热情、政治兴趣也在“五反”中大为提高。他们正在进一步地组织起来。不少职工要求参加中国共产党或青年团。包福记钢铁建设厂有二十多个青年工人申请入团，其中十七人已获该区团工委批准。有些工厂原来没有团的组织，青年工人们就自动向本区团工委再三申请入团，并要求在厂内建立团的组织。同时，由于职工们的革命热情和政治兴趣的提高，工会工作也顺利开展。许多工厂的工会活动，“五反”后都活跃起来。读报组、文化学习组如雨后春笋般地普遍建立。例如华新文具仪器厂“五反”前只有工会小组，“五反”后建立了工会筹备委员会，成立了三个工会小组、三个读报小组，出版了工会小组的墙报，并且积极计划设立医药箱，建立互助储金会。
    这七十四家工厂、商店的资本家，除普遍参加了“五反”第二个战役，争取戴罪立功外，在生产和营业上也安下心来了。在职工们不断督促和紧张劳动的影响下，他们的经营信心也比“五反”前提高，许多人正在拟订今后经营计划。他们在处理生产和经营上种种问题时，也都能经常和工会、工人代表商量。
