Under the correct leadership of the Party and the People's Government and with the close assistance of people's publishing houses throughout the country, the Xinjiang People's Publishing House has made considerable achievements in the past year, basically implementing the policy of "publishing books and periodicals in the languages of all fraternal ethnic groups and disseminating Mao Zedong Thought to the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang."

Since its establishment in March 1951, the Xinjiang People's Publishing House has systematically organized the translation and publication of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian languages. As of now, according to the new version of Volume I of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," seven articles have been translated into Uyghur and published in six separate booklets (two short articles were combined into one booklet); the remaining articles are being typeset for publication. The Kazakh and Mongolian manuscripts are also being actively translated and reviewed. After these separate booklets are published and distributed, opinions will be widely solicited from readers of all fraternal ethnic groups and the translation community to ensure that the translations are completely accurate before the collected volumes are published.

Many other works by Chairman Mao have also been translated into Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian languages. Among them, 56 have been translated into Uyghur, with 15 already published; 20 into Kazakh, with 4 already published; and 1 into Mongolian, which has also been published. While fully engaged in translating and publishing Chairman Mao's works, and in coordination with the movements to Resist America, Aid Korea, suppress counter-revolutionaries, and reduce rent and oppose local bullies, a large number of ethnic language books and periodicals have been compiled, translated, and published. Furthermore, in light of the actual situation in Xinjiang, picture story books have been published in Uyghur, etc. The language and content of these books and periodicals are generally easy to understand, and they are loved and welcomed by the broad masses of readers.

In order to timely solve the problem of textbooks for primary and secondary schools, the publishing house has cooperated with the Provincial Department of Education to review, translate, and publish Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian primary and secondary school textbooks. It also published "Literacy Textbook for Workers and Peasants" in Uyghur, with a distribution of 450,000 copies. In the past year, 182 kinds of books and periodicals related to policies, current affairs, social sciences, natural sciences, work experience, and literary works have been published in Chinese, Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian languages, totaling 2,068,179 copies. Among them, 79 kinds in Uyghur, with 1,655,153 copies; 16 kinds in Kazakh, with 53,504 copies; 24 kinds in Mongolian, with 31,352 copies; and 63 kinds in Chinese, with 328,170 copies. There are also 17 kinds that have been typeset but not yet published, totaling 314,000 copies.

In order to cooperate with the political tasks of each period, to guide and promote the movement in a timely manner, and to publicize the policies and decrees of the Party and the People's Government to farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in rural and pastoral areas in a popular way, and to introduce knowledge about the great motherland and related sciences and production, the bi-monthly publication "Xinjiang Propagandist" has been published in both Chinese and Uyghur languages, and has now been published to the 17th issue. The Uyghur version has a maximum circulation of 20,000 copies per issue.

Through the above-mentioned various books and periodicals, Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought have been publicized to the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, the various policies and decrees of the Party and the People's Government have been publicized, the political consciousness of the broad masses has been raised, and the people of all ethnic groups have been organized and promoted to actively participate in national construction.

In the past year, the people of all ethnic groups have shown great interest and concern for their own publications. Many readers often write to the publishing house, offering suggestions for improvement on the language content, cover design, printing, and binding of the books and periodicals. Due to the large number of various books and periodicals published, a upsurge of studying Mao Zedong Thought has been formed among the fraternal ethnic groups; they regard Chairman Mao's works as treasures. For example, after the first volume of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" was distributed in Dihua (Ürümqi), they wrote one after another to inquire: "When will the ethnic minority language 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' be published?" Readers of "On Practice" also wrote to request a reprint.

In order to better do the people's publishing work and publicize Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the publishing house has formulated the work guidelines and specific plans for 1952. This year, it will first devote all its efforts to completing the task of translating and publishing 71 separate booklets of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian languages (publishing all articles in "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" separately), totaling approximately 1,085,000 copies. Under the leadership of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" Translation and Publication Committee organized by the Xinjiang Sub-bureau of the CPC Central Committee, a special plan and work rules and methods have been formulated and started. In addition, a large number of various political readings urgently needed by ethnic minority cadres and popular readings needed by the masses of all ethnic groups will be compiled and published, mainly in Uyghur, Kazakh, and Mongolian languages.

    新疆人民出版社大量发行民族文字书刊
    “毛泽东选集”的翻译出版工作正积极进行中
    新疆人民出版社在党和人民政府的正确领导和全国各地人民出版社的亲密帮助下，一年来获得不少成绩，基本上贯彻了“出版各兄弟民族文字书刊、向新疆各族人民传播毛泽东思想”的方针。
    新疆人民出版社于一九五一年三月间成立后，即有计划、有步骤地组织了翻译、出版维、哈、蒙文
    “毛泽东选集”的工作。截至目前，已按“毛泽东选集”第一卷的新版本，用维文译出了其中的七篇，分以六个单行册（内有两个短篇合刊于一个单行册）出版；其余各篇正陆续发排。哈、蒙文稿也正在积极翻译、审查中。这些单行册于出版发行后，将广泛征集各兄弟民族读者和翻译界的意见，以使译文完全正确，然后再出版卷集。
    毛主席的其他著作，译成维、哈、蒙三种文字的也很多。其中译成维文的有五十六种，已出版十五种；哈文二十种，已出版四种；蒙文一种，也已出版。在全力翻译、出版毛主席著作的同时，并配合抗美援朝、镇压反革命、减租反恶霸等运动，大量地编、译、出版了民族文字的书刊，并结合新疆实际情况，以维文出版了连环图画等。这些书刊的文字，内容一般都通俗易懂，受到广大读者群众的爱好和欢迎。
    为适时地解决中、小学课本，该社曾协同省教育厅审订和翻译出版了维、哈、蒙文的中、小学教科书。并曾以维文出版了“工农识字课本”，发行达四十五万册。一年来以汉、维、哈、蒙四种文字出版的有关政策、时事、社会科学、自然科学、工作经验、文艺读物等书刊有一百八十二种，共二百零六万八千一百七十九册。其中维文的七十九种，一百六十五万五千一百五十三册；哈文的十六种，五万三千五百零四册；蒙文的二十四种，三万一千三百五十二册；汉文的六十三种，三十二万八千一百七十册。已发排而尚未出版的还有十七种，共三十一万四千册。
    为配合每个时期的政治任务，及时指导并推动运动，面向农村、牧区，通俗地向各族农、牧民宣传党和人民政府的政策法令，介绍伟大祖国和有关科学、生产等知识，曾分别出版了汉、维两种文字的“新疆宣传员”半月刊一种，现已出版至十七期。维文的版本每期最高发行量达两万册。
    通过上述各种书刊，向新疆各族人民宣传了马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，宣传了党和人民政府的各项政策、法令，提高了广大群众的政治觉悟，组织和推动了各民族人民积极参加国家建设。
    一年来，各族人民对自己的出版物表示了极大的兴趣和关怀。许多读者经常写信给该社，对书刊的文字内容和封面设计、印刷、装帧等提出了改进意见。由于各种书刊的大量出版，在各兄弟民族中学习毛泽东思想已形成为一个热潮；他们对毛主席的著作均视如珍宝，如当“毛泽东选集”第一卷在迪化市发行后，他们便纷纷来信询问：“民族文字的‘毛泽东选集’什么时候出版？”“实践论”的读者也纷纷来信要求再版。
    为了更好地做好人民出版工作，宣传马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，该社已拟定了一九五二年的工作方针和具体计划。今年首先将以全力完成翻译、出版维、哈、蒙文“毛泽东选集”单行册（将“毛泽东选集”中的全部文章，分别出版单行册）七十一种，约一百零八万五千册的任务，现已在中共中央新疆分局组织的“毛泽东选集”翻译出版委员会领导下，定出专门计划和工作规则、办法等开始进行。此外将大量编译、出版民族干部所急需的各种政治读物和各族群众所需要的通俗读物，这些读物均以维、哈、蒙三种文字为主。
