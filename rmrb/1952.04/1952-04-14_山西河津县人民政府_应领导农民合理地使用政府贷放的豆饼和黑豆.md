To the Editor: On March 31st, some of our school's students were conducting propaganda work at the Yicun market in Hejin County. We heard a farmer say, "The government loaned fertilizer to increase production, but some people are mixing soybean cakes with vegetables to eat." During the propaganda summary meeting, students Yan Bianzi and Wang Guodong also reported, "In villages such as Luzhuang and Xiyadi, some people, seeing that the cotton fields already have fertilizer, are feeding black beans to livestock." We believe this phenomenon is worth noting. The government loans soybean cakes to farmers to solve their fertilizer problems and help them increase yields per unit area. Therefore, the government should earnestly guide farmers to rationally use the loaned fertilizer. I suggest that relevant departments check and stop this phenomenon.

    山西河津县人民政府
    应领导农民合理地使用政府贷放的豆饼和黑豆
    编辑同志：三月三十一日，我们学校有的同学在河津县奕村集会上进行宣传工作，听一位农民反映说：“政府贷肥为了增产，可是有些人把豆饼拌菜吃了。”在宣传总结会上，阎便子、王国栋等同学也反映说：“芦庄、西崖底等村部分群众见棉田已有肥料，都把黑豆喂了牲口。”我们认为这种现象是值得注意的。政府贷给农民豆饼，是为了解决农民的肥料问题，协助农民提高单位面积产量。因此，政府应当认真领导农民合理使用贷肥。我建议有关部门检查并制止这种现象。
