    The victory of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement has brought a new look to the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway.
    After the "Three Antis" movement purged the spies and embezzlers sent in by illegal capitalists, the sense of ownership among the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway workers was strengthened, and work efficiency significantly improved. A bridge worker said, "Eliminating corrupt elements is like plugging a leaking hole, and we must work even harder!" They eliminated the backward operating methods of bridge and culvert construction from the past and adopted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. This method not only extends the service life of bridges and culverts but also increases work efficiency by 50%, reducing the unit price per cubic meter of engineering from 33,600 yuan to 26,000 yuan. The March tasks of the forging workshop and mechanical workshop of a temporary railway factory in a certain place were completed twelve days ahead of schedule. The mechanical workshop originally planned to produce 240 screw caps per group in six hours. Because they used the Kovalev work method, work efficiency was greatly improved. Now, the Liu Zhu San group produces 670 pieces in six hours, increasing work efficiency by 279%. Train crew members have established a series of systems to ensure driving safety, such as meeting systems, experience exchange systems, three diligence systems (i.e., operational personnel are diligent in communication, diligent in inspection, and diligent in observation), and call-and-response systems. As a result, there were no responsible driving accidents in March. Staff at the Neijiang crew room have increased train speed from 19 kilometers per hour to 40 kilometers per hour in order to shorten vehicle turnaround time. Locomotive No. 2266 is the oldest and smallest locomotive on the Chengdu-Chongqing line. Under normal circumstances, its traction force is only 400 tons. However, because the crew members of the contracted crew put forward the slogan "Don't be afraid of old locomotives, as long as they are well maintained, they can pull more and run faster," they exceeded the axle traction by 1,859 tons in nine days.
    Through the "Three Antis" movement, the vast number of employees have strengthened their care for state property, and everyone has paid more attention to conservation. They said, "In the past, corrupt elements stole everywhere. Now that those guys have been defeated, more work and more savings will mean more wealth for the country." In the past, people in charge of materials threw materials around, and many were wasted as scrap. Now, workers collect those scraps in their spare time, sort them out, and use them. For example, Liu Shaosong, Liu Qishun, Wang Zhengde, and Feng Yaojin, four mud workers from the Guanghan mud worker team, discovered a pile of lime buried in the soil and sorted out more than 2,000 kilograms during their rest time. Workers in the Chengdu carpentry team used waste materials to make tile corners, saving the state many thirteen-foot-long fir strips.
    Many engineering and technical personnel also received profound education during the "Three Antis" movement. They realized that the correctness of planning and design is not only related to the life and safety of the project but also to the conservation and waste of state assets. Therefore, they have made great improvements in their work style and methods. For example, in the past, the Chengdu Engineering Section did not study the nature of the soil when planning the slope of the roadbed but only followed the dogmatic procedures in books, resulting in landslides in many places. A certain section under the jurisdiction of the Chengdu Engineering Section collapsed by more than 30,000 cubic meters, wasting more than 290 million yuan in project costs. Now, engineering and technical personnel determine the proportion of the slope according to the different depths of excavation, which has solved the problem of landslides. This technical improvement has enabled the engineering section to successfully complete earthwork projects that were not completed in the past. Another example is the wharf management office in a certain place. Because it was difficult to load and unload heavy goods at the original wharf, it was planned to build another wharf last year. The total construction cost of this plan would be about 18 billion yuan, and the construction project would also take a long time. Now, technical personnel have relied on workers to come up with a solution, widening the original wharf and using a 45-ton crane on top. This has solved the difficulty of loading and unloading heavy goods, and the total project cost is only 118.8 million yuan. (Xinhua News Agency)

### “三反”运动的胜利给成渝铁路带来新气象

    “三反”运动的胜利给成渝铁路带来新气象
    反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的胜利，给成渝铁路带来了新气象。
    在“三反”运动中清除了不法资本家派进来的坐探和贪污分子后，成渝铁路职工们的主人翁感觉加强，而工作效率显著提高。某桥梁工人说：“把贪污分子肃清了等于塞住了漏水窟窿，我们工作要更起劲！”他们革除了过去落后的桥涵安砌工作操作方法，采用了苏联的先进经验，这种操作法不但可以延长桥涵的使用期限，并提高工作效率百分之五十，使每公方工程单价由三万三千六百元降低为二万六千元。某地临时铁路工厂的锻工场和机械工场的三月份任务，已提前十二天完成。机械工场打穿螺丝帽原定每组六小时打二百四十只，由于他们运用了郭瓦廖夫工作方法，工作效率提高很多，现在刘祝三小组在六小时打六百七十只，提高工作效率百分之二百七十九。列车乘务人员为了保证行车安全，建立了一系列的制度。如会议制度、经验交流制度、三勤制度（即运转人员勤联系、勤检查、勤了望）和呼唤应答制度等，因而三月份做到了全月无责任行车事故。内江乘务室工作人员为了缩短车辆周转时间，已将列车速度从每小时十九公里提高到四十公里。二二六六号机车是成渝路上最老的也是最小的一台机车，一般情况牵引力不过四百吨，由于包乘组的乘务人员们提出“不怕机车老，只要保养好，一样多拉，一样快跑”的口号，在九天之内，就超轴牵引了一千八百五十九吨。
    广大职工经过“三反”运动，加强了对国家财产的爱护，大家更加注意节约。他们说：“过去贪污分子到处进行盗窃，现在把那些家伙打垮了，多做活多节约，国家也就多积累财富。”从前管材料的人把材料乱丢乱抛，许多都作为废料浪费了；现在工人在工余时间把那些废料收集起来，加以整理使用。如广汉泥工队刘绍松、刘期顺、王正德、冯耀金四个人，发现一堆被土埋住的石灰，就在休息时间整理出了二千多斤。成都木工队的工人，用废料作瓦角子，给国家节省了许多一丈三尺长的杉条。
    “三反”运动中许多工程技术人员也受到了深刻的教育。他们认识到计划和设计的正确与否不仅关系着工程的寿命和安全，而且关系着国家资产的节约和浪费。所以他们在工作作风和工作方法上已有很大改进。如成都工务段过去在计划路基坡度时，没有研究土壤的性质，只沿用书本上的教条规程，结果许多地方塌方。成都工务段所辖某分段就塌了三万多方，浪费工程费二亿九千余万元。现在工程技术人员就根据挖方深度的不同来决定坡度的比例，这样解决了塌方问题。这一技术上的改进，已使这个工务段顺利地完成了过去未完成的土方工程。又如某地码头管理所，因原码头起卸笨重货物很困难，去年计划另修码头，这个计划的全部修建费约需一百八十亿元，修建工程也要很长时间。现在技术人员依靠工人想出了办法，把原码头加宽一些，上面用四十五吨的大吊车。这样就解决了起卸笨重货物的困难，全部工程费用只一亿一千八百万元。（新华社）
