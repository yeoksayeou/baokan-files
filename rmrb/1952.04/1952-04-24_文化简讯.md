    ▲The second sessions of the Guizhou Nationalities Institute and the Yunnan Nationalities Institute have opened successively. The ethnic composition of the students participating in the second sessions of these two institutes is more extensive than that of the first session. Many ethnic groups who never had the opportunity to study in the past have now sent outstanding children of their own ethnic groups to study. The first sessions of these two institutes trained more than 700 outstanding cadres from various ethnic groups. After graduation, most of them returned to their own ethnic regions and, under the leadership of the People's Government, participated in various construction projects of their own ethnic groups.
