Yang Zhenru, Zou Yubin, Chen Yongkang from Southern Jiangsu, and Li Chenggui from Hunan, all model rice farmers awarded by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, and the mutual aid and cooperative organizations they each lead, will this year engage in a rice production increase competition with rice farmers and mutual aid cooperative organizations across the country. Rice production in our country ranks first in the world, and also ranks first among all kinds of crops in the country, being the most important food crop. Before the war, the average rice yield per mu in our country was more than 300 jin. Last year, the highest yield of Yang Zhenru's paddy field was 1,620 jin per mu; Chen Yongkang's was 1,433 jin; Li Chenggui's was 1,314 jin, and the rice yield per mu of Zou Yubin's mutual aid team all exceeded 1,000 jin. The production increase competition they initiated this year will promote the general increase in rice production in our country, thereby ensuring the completion of this year's grain production increase task. They hope that rice farmers in various places will actively respond to the challenge and strive for increased rice production. Below is their joint challenge letter.

"Based on our experience, it is possible to increase the yield of rice per mu to 1,000 jin. We hope that mutual aid cooperative organizations and farmer brothers across the country will strive to achieve this goal. We will further increase the yield of our paddy fields by improving and enhancing our mutual aid cooperative organizations, improving labor efficiency, and improving technology. To this end, we challenge you.

    I. The yield per mu of all our paddy fields (excluding the newly reclaimed paddy fields of Yang Zhenru's team) must reach more than 1,000 jin this year; we should have at least three mu of paddy fields with a yield of more than 1,500 jin. This is our joint competition condition. In addition, Yang Zhenru's team will strive to achieve a yield of 1,100 jin for all paddy fields (except for newly reclaimed fields), creating a record of 1,800 jin; Chen Yongkang's mutual aid team will achieve a yield of 1,000 jin for all paddy fields, creating a record of 1,600 jin; Li Chenggui's mutual aid team will achieve 1,250 jin for the entire group, creating a record of more than 1,500 jin; Zou Yubin's mutual aid team will achieve 1,200 jin for the entire group, creating a record of more than 1,500 jin. In addition to rice, we also guarantee to grow other crops well, with yields no lower than the general level of the local area.

    II. We are determined to complete the production increase target we have set by constantly studying and improving rice planting techniques. 1. The nursery fields and the main fields should be repeatedly plowed and harrowed many times to ensure that the soil is flat, soft, and loose; the depth of plowing should be deeper than last year and deeper than that of ordinary farmers in the local area; increase the number of weeding and hoeing to ensure that the fields are free of weeds. 2. Select high-yielding and good-quality rice seeds, and select them carefully before sowing to cultivate strong seedlings. 3. Implement appropriate close planting. 4. Apply a large amount of fertilizer: the amount of fertilizer applied should be more than last year and exceed that of ordinary paddy fields in the local area; and apply more top dressing. 5. Do a good job in drought and flood prevention to ensure that the paddy fields are not short of water and are not waterlogged. 6. Ensure the timely elimination of rice borers and other insect pests.

    III. We guarantee to promptly promote the experience we have gained to promote rice production increase in the whole village.

    杨振儒等互助组发起水稻增产竞赛
    获得中央人民政府农业部奖励的水稻丰产模范河北杨振儒、邹玉彬、苏南陈永康、湖南李承桂和他们各人领导的互助合作组织，今年要和全国种水稻的农民和互助合作组织作水稻增产竞赛。我国水稻产量占世界第一位，在全国各种农作物中也占第一位，是最主要的粮食作物。战前我国水稻每亩平均产量为三百多斤，去年，杨振儒的稻田最高产量是每亩一千六百二十斤；陈永康的是一千四百三十三斤，李承桂的是一千三百十四斤，邹玉彬互助组全组的水稻每亩产量都在千斤以上。今年他们发起的增产竞赛，将推动我国水稻产量普遍提高，从而保证完成今年的粮食增产任务。他们希望各地种水稻的农民踊跃应战，争取水稻增产。下面是他们的联合挑战书。
    “根据我们的经验，要把水稻的每亩产量提高到一千斤是做得到的。我们希望全国种水稻的互助合作组织和农民弟兄，大家为达到这个目标奋斗。我们要以健全和提高我们的互助合作组织，提高劳动效率和改进技术，来进一步提高我们的稻田产量。为此，我们向你们挑战。
    一、我们的全部稻田（杨振儒小队的新垦稻田不在内），今年的每亩产量都要达到一千斤以上；我们应有至少三亩稻田的产量达到一千五百斤以上。这是我们的联合竞赛条件。此外，杨振儒小队要争取全部稻田（新垦田除外）产量达到一千一百斤，创造一千八百斤的纪录；陈永康互助组的全部稻田产量达到一千斤，创造一千六百斤的纪录；李承桂互助组全组达到一千二百五十斤，创造一千五百斤以上的纪录；邹玉彬互助组全组达到一千二百斤，创造一千五百斤以上的纪录。除水稻外，我们还保证把其他的庄稼种好，产量不低于当地的一般水平。
    二、我们决以经常研究并提高种稻技术来完成我们提出的增产目标。1．秧田和本田都要反复耕耙多次，作到土壤平整松软；耕的深度要比去年深，并比当地一般农民耕得深；增加耘田锄草遍数，保证田无杂草。2．选用丰产优良稻种，播种前还要精选以培育壮秧。3．实行适当的密植。4．大量施肥：施肥量应比去年多，并超过当地一般稻田；并多施追肥。5．作好防旱防涝工作，保证稻田不缺水，不渍水。6．保证及时消灭水稻螟害和其他虫害。
    三、我们保证把我们获得的经验及时推广出去，带动全村水稻丰产。
