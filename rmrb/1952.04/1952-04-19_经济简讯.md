Economic Briefs

    ▲ The first nodular cast iron research class, organized by the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, officially started on April 7th. This marks the beginning of the Industrial Department's planned and step-by-step promotion of this advanced production method after the successful trial of the nodular cast iron method. Sixty-two engineers, veteran workers, and technicians from the foundry departments of machinery, non-ferrous metals, textile, coal mine, and railway systems are participating in this research class. Their study period is tentatively set for forty days, after which they will master the nodular cast iron method proficiently.
    ▲ The workers of Wuhan are enthusiastically participating in the Jingjiang River Flood Diversion Project. They are either signing up to participate in the work on the construction site, or rushing to build sluice gates for the Jingjiang River Flood Diversion Project. Their class consciousness has generally improved during the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. When they heard the good news of the Jingjiang River Flood Diversion Project, they all raced to sign up. More than 9,000 workers from various industries have now signed up and are heading to the construction site in succession. Wu Jiaming, a 66-year-old worker in the machinery manufacturing industry, also requested the union to approve his going to the dike. Xia Weixin, a young worker from the Huaqiang Motor Factory, and Tang Xianbin, a young worker from the Zhongshu Machine Factory, voluntarily postponed their scheduled wedding dates to after the completion of the project in order to participate in the construction project. The workers remaining in Wuhan are also supporting the Jingjiang River Flood Diversion Project in various different work positions.
    ▲ A section of the Yellow River in Dengkou County, Ningxia Province, is prone to frequent flooding during the spring thaw, when upstream floods rush down, and ice dams formed by accumulated ice floes in this section of the riverbed remain frozen. Although the local people's government mobilized farmers for flood prevention last year, more than 11,000 mu of farmland were still flooded due to excessive ice dams. In order to ensure the safety of the lives and property of the people in the area, the Central People's Government specially dispatched a unit of artillery in mid-March this year to assist farmers in clearing the spring ice flood. When the river water surged on March 16, the artillery bombarded and opened the ice dams, allowing the floodwaters to flow smoothly. Farmers along the river in Ningxia Province are now widely launching a spring repair and ditch-digging competition. 50,000 emancipated women from both the Hui and Han ethnic groups are also actively participating in this competition.

    经济简讯
    ▲东北人民政府工业部举办的第一期球墨铸铁研究班，已在四月七日正式开课。这是工业部自球墨铸铁法试验成功后，有计划、有步骤地推广这一先进生产方法的开端。参加这期研究班学习的有机械、有色金属、纺织、煤矿、铁路等系统翻砂部门的工程师、老工人和技术员共六十二人。他们这一期的学习时间暂定为四十天，结束后将熟练地掌握球墨铸铁法。
    ▲武汉市的工人热情地参加兴修荆江分洪工程。他们或者报名参加工地上的工作，或者为荆江分洪工程赶造水闸闸门。他们在“三反”和“五反”运动中，阶级觉悟普遍提高。当他们听到兴修荆江分洪工程的喜讯后，都竞相报名。现在报名的各业工人已达九千多人，正陆续开赴工地。机器制造业六十六岁的老工人吴家明也要求工会批准上了堤。华强电机厂青工夏为新和中舒机器厂青工汤贤斌，为了参加兴修工程，自动将预定的婚期延迟到完工以后。留在武汉市内的工人，也都在各种不同的工作岗位上支援荆江分洪工程。
    ▲宁夏省磴口县一段黄河，每到春季解冻时期，上游洪水涌下，这一段河床中冰凌堆积起的冰坝仍然固封，因此经常泛滥成灾。去年虽经当地人民政府发动农民防汛，但因冰坝过多，仍淹了一万一千多亩农田。为了保障该地人民生命财产的安全，今年三月中旬，中央人民政府特派出炮兵一部协助农民排解春季凌汛。三月十六日河水猛涨时，炮兵便发炮轰开了冰坝，使洪水得以顺利宣泄。现在宁夏省沿河一带农民，已广泛开展春修挖渠的竞赛。五万回、汉两族的翻身妇女也积极地参加了这个竞赛。
