    The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau Directly Subordinate Organs Hold Party Representative Conference to Determine the Central Tasks of the Organs' Party Committee; Unanimously Agree That Political and Ideological Leadership Must Be Strengthened After the "Three-Anti" Campaign
    [Our Newspaper] The Directly Subordinate Organs of the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau held their first Party Representative Conference from March 26th to April 1st. This conference was convened to consolidate and expand the results of the anti-corruption, anti-waste, and anti-bureaucracy movement (Three-Anti Campaign), to continue to leverage the political enthusiasm cultivated by all staff members in the "Three-Anti" movement, to strengthen political and ideological leadership, and to improve the Party's work in the organs. A total of ninety-eight representatives attended the conference, representing nineteen branches and nine hundred and twenty-one party members from various departments, committees, and other directly subordinate units of the North China Bureau, as well as various North China-level people's organizations; seventeen people, including responsible party members in administrative positions from various departments and organizations, and representatives of the organs' Communist Youth League general branch, attended as observers. The conference listened to, discussed, and approved four reports: a summary of the "Three-Anti" movement in the directly subordinate organs of the North China Bureau, the Party's work in the organs over the past year, the North China Bureau organs' administrative work, and organs' production; adopted a trial outline for branch work in 1952; reviewed and initially handled 275 proposals related to organization, education, administration, and other aspects; put forward opinions or plans for improving various tasks; and finally re-elected the organs' Party committee and adopted the conference resolution.
    The main achievement of the conference was to clearly point out the central tasks of the organs' Party committee after the victory of the "Three-Anti" movement. The conference unanimously agreed that: in the future, it is necessary to strengthen political and ideological leadership, further improve the Marxist-Leninist level of party members, promote democracy, foster a lively, proactive, responsible, and creative work style, enhance the combat effectiveness of the Party organizations in the organs, and further improve the work efficiency and accuracy of the organs. To this end, the conference especially emphasized that in the future, it is necessary to closely link with the actual situation of thought, continuously conduct Marxist-Leninist education, improve the political consciousness of party members, continue to launch the struggle to eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology, continue to overcome and prevent bureaucratic work styles, oppose petty-bourgeois and all non-proletarian ideological styles, and, in view of the current ideological situation of party members in the organs, oppose individualism and liberalism and certain erroneous ideas of being uneasy about working in the organs, improve organizational life, fully promote inner-Party democracy, and correctly carry out criticism and self-criticism. In order to do a good job in the organs' work, the conference pointed out that the Party committee and branches must deeply care about the living and welfare problems of the organs' staff, and assist and supervise the administrative departments of the organs in improving the organs' administrative work.
    The main characteristic of this conference was that it conscientiously acted in accordance with the Party Constitution from beginning to end, and implemented the principle of democratic centralism within the Party. After being drafted by designated personnel, the four reports of the conference were repeatedly discussed by branches and groups before the meeting, extensively soliciting opinions, twice in some cases and six times in others. Finally, the preparatory committee gathered the opinions of the masses, revised them, and then passed them unanimously after group discussions and conference discussions. When electing the Party Committee of the directly subordinate organs, the presidium first drafted election methods, which were discussed by the representative groups and then passed at the conference. According to the election methods, the presidium put forward a list of candidates, which was given to the representative groups for discussion and deliberation, and the representative groups could also supplement candidates they wished to propose. Then, a preliminary election was held by the groups, and those with the most votes in the centralized preliminary election were formal candidates. Finally, the new Party Committee was elected at the conference by secret ballot. The handling of the proposals was done by the presidium designating candidates from the representatives to form a proposal review committee, classifying and summarizing the proposals, explaining them to the representatives one by one, and tasking the next Party Committee with handling them. During the conference, all representatives maintained close contact with the organizations and party members they represented, promptly conveyed the conference situation, and reflected the opinions of party members, making the conference closely related to every party member. All of the above shows that the conference fully promoted democracy, embodied the leadership method of the mass line, and thus enabled the wisdom of all party members to be fully expressed at the conference.
    The Standing Committee of the North China Bureau was very concerned about the preparation and convening of the conference, and directly led and specifically helped the work of this representative conference. During the preparation process of the conference, the Standing Committee listened to two oral reports from the preparatory committee of the representative conference, and made specific instructions and reviews on everything from general principles and policies to meeting procedures. At the beginning of the conference, Liu Lantao, the third secretary of the North China Bureau, attended and spoke on behalf of the North China Bureau, enabling all representatives to clearly understand the purpose of the conference, laying the ideological foundation for a successful conference, which was also the key to the success of the conference. Wang Congwu, a member of the Standing Committee of the North China Bureau, and Hou Weiyu, the secretary-general, both participated in the conference, listened to reports, and helped solve problems. Finally, Wang Congwu made a conclusion for the conference, enabling the representatives and all party members to further systematically understand the significance of the conference, laying a solid ideological foundation for implementing the resolutions and spirit of the conference in the future.
    The success of the conference is inseparable from the full preparations made before the conference. First of all, the "Three-Anti" movement in the organs laid a victorious foundation for the conference. In the "Three-Anti" movement, responsible persons of each department took the lead at all levels, and universally carried out democratic inspections and launched a democratic reform movement. The Economy and Thrift Examination Committee of the North China Bureau directly subordinate organs also absorbed more than 50 cadres from various departments and relevant cadres from administrative departments to form nine inspection teams, conducting mass inspections of the administrative work of the North China Bureau organs, fully promoting democracy, enhancing the enthusiasm of the masses, and putting forward work reform plans, which played an extremely important role in promoting the administrative work of the organs and some other tasks. On this basis, the previous Party Committee, under the direct leadership of the North China Bureau, formed a preparatory committee for the conference in mid-February and began various preparations such as electing representatives and soliciting proposals. In particular, the drafting of the conference's various summary reports and the trial outline for branch work was preceded by multiple discussions and revisions by all party members. The summary of the "Three-Anti" movement and the report on the administrative work of the organs were first reviewed and passed by the Economy and Thrift Examination Committee of the organs. On the eve of the opening of the conference, the preparatory committee convened a preparatory meeting to report to the representatives on the preparation process and the status of the representative qualification review, passed the list of the conference presidium and the list of observers, and formed representative groups.
    The conference was an extremely profound ideological and democratic education for every representative and all party members, as well as all non-Party workers in the organs. The conference enabled everyone to learn from practice how to act in accordance with the Party Constitution, and at the same time made everyone pay attention to the Party's work in the organs, improving the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of party members, laying a good ideological foundation for improving the work of the organs in the future. Some Party Committee members and branch committee members deeply felt that they had not been responsible enough for the Party's work in the organs in the past, and expressed that they would do a good job in the future. Some party members engaged in the administrative work of the organs were deeply moved after listening to the speeches of Liu Lantao and Wang Congwu, saying: "In the past, we thought that administrative work was lowly, others looked down on it, and we also had feelings of inferiority. Now we have further and more truly realized that this is a glorious revolutionary task." The worker representative from Zhenhua Printing Factory said: "I feel very honored to participate in this conference, which made me fully see that the Party is very democratic. Comrade Liu Lantao's report moved me very much. I used to be slow and careless in my work. In the future, I must be more careful, unite with non-Party masses, and do a good job." The representatives and party members also unanimously stated that they would take practical actions to implement the resolutions of the representative conference and implement the spirit of the conference in the various tasks of the organs.
    The earnest transmission and study of the conference resolutions and reports is an important link in implementing the spirit and resolutions of the conference. This transmission and discussion is being carried out throughout the organs in conjunction with ideological inspections and the establishment of new work systems. The new directly subordinate Party Committee is planning to further organize and carry out this work among all party members.

    中共中央华北局直属机关开党员代表大会
    确定机关党委的中心任务
    一致认为“三反”后必须加强政治思想领导
    【本报讯】中共中央华北局直属机关在三月二十六日到四月一日举行第一次党员代表大会。这次大会是为了巩固和扩大反贪污、反浪费、反官僚主义运动的成果，继续发挥全体工作人员在“三反”运动中增长起来的政治热情，加强政治思想领导，改进机关党的工作而召开的。参加大会的代表共九十八人，代表着华北局各部、委及其他直属单位和华北级各人民团体的十九个支部和九百二十一个党员；列席的有各部门、各团体在行政上负责的党员和机关青年团总支的代表十七人。大会听取、讨论并批准了华北局直属机关的“三反”运动总结，一年来机关党的工作和华北局机关的行政工作、机关生产等四个报告；通过了一九五二年支部工作试行纲要；审查并初步处理了有关组织、教育、行政等方面的二百七十五条提案；提出了改进各项工作的意见或方案；最后改选了机关党委，通过了大会决议。
    大会的主要收获是明确指出了“三反”运动胜利以后机关党委的中心任务。大会一致认为：今后必须加强政治思想领导，进一步提高党员的马克思列宁主义的水平，发扬民主，发扬生动活泼、主动负责和创造性的工作作风，增强机关中党的组织的战斗力，进一步提高机关的工作效率和工作的准确性。为此，大会特别强调今后必须密切联系思想实际，不断地进行马克思列宁主义的教育，提高党员的政治觉悟，继续展开清除资产阶级思想影响的斗争，继续克服和防止官僚主义作风，反对小资产阶级和一切非无产阶级的思想作风，并针对目前机关党员的思想情况，反对个人主义和自由主义及某些不安心机关工作的错误思想，健全组织生活，充分发扬党内民主，正确地开展批评和自我批评。为了做好机关工作，大会指出党委和支部必须深切关心机关工作人员的生活福利问题，协助并监督机关行政工作部门改进机关行政工作。
    这次大会的主要特点，是自始至终都认真地按着党章办事，贯彻了党内民主集中制的原则。大会的四个报告在指定专人起草后，会前都曾经过支部、小组的反复讨论，广泛征集意见，少的两次，多的六次，最后又由筹委会将群众的意见集中起来加以修正，在大会上又经过了小组讨论及大会讨论并一致通过。选举直属机关党的委员会时，首先由主席团草拟了选举办法，经过代表小组讨论后在大会上通过。根据选举办法，主席团提出候选名单，交给代表小组讨论酝酿，代表小组也可以补入自己愿意提出的候选人。然后由小组预选，再集中预选时获票最多者为正式候选人，最后在大会上采取无记名投票的办法选出新的党委。提案的处理，是由主席团从代表中指定人选，组成提案审查委员会，将提案分类加以审查归纳，向代表一一做了交代，并责成下届党委处理。在大会期间，所有代表都和自己所代表的组织和党员保持密切的联系，及时传达大会情况，反映党员意见，使大会和每个党员息息相关。以上都说明大会充分发扬了民主，体现了群众路线的领导方法，因而才使全体党员的智慧在大会上得以充分表现出来。
    华北局常务委员会十分关心大会的准备和召开，并直接领导和具体帮助了这次代表大会的工作。在大会的准备过程中，常委会曾听取了代表大会筹备委员会的两次口头汇报，大至方针政策，小至会议程序，都作了具体的指示和审查。大会开始时，华北局第三书记刘澜涛代表华北局出席讲话，使全体代表明确认识了大会的目的，打下了开好这次大会的思想基础，也是大会能够成功的关键。华北局常委王从吾和秘书长侯维煜都曾参加大会，听取汇报，帮助解决问题。最后王从吾并为大会做了结论，使代表及全体党员进一步系统地认识了大会的意义，打下了今后贯彻大会决议和大会精神的有力的思想基础。
    大会的成功，是和会前充分的准备工作分不开的，首先是机关的“三反”运动为大会打下了胜利的基础。在“三反”运动中，各部门负责人层层带头，普遍进行了民主检查，开展了民主改革运动。华北局直属机关节约检查委员会更吸收各部门干部和行政部门有关干部五十多人，组成了九个检查小组，对华北局机关的行政工作做了群众性的检查，充分发扬了民主，提高了群众的积极性，提出了工作改革方案，对机关行政工作和其他一些工作的推进起了极为重大的作用。在这个基础上，上届党委会在华北局的直接领导下，在二月中旬就组成大会筹备委员会，开始了选举代表，征求提案等各项准备工作，特别是对大会的各种总结报告和支部工作试行纲要的起草，事前都经过了全体党员的多次讨论和修改，“三反”运动的总结和机关行政工作的报告，曾先经过机关节约检查委员会的审查通过。大会开幕前夕，筹委会召开了预备会议，向代表报告了筹备经过和代表资格审查的情况，通过了大会主席团名单和列席人的名单，并组成代表小组。
    大会对每个代表和所有党员以及机关一切非党工作人员，都是一次极其深刻的思想教育和民主教育，大会使大家从实践中学会了如何按党章办事，同时使大家重视了机关党的工作，提高了党员的积极性和责任心，为今后改进机关工作打下了很好的思想基础。有些党委委员和支部委员，都深深感到过去对机关党的工作负责不够，并表示今后要把工作做好。有些做机关行政工作的党员，听了刘澜涛和王从吾的讲话后，深受感动地说：“过去认为行政工作是低贱的，别人看不起，自己也有自卑思想，现在才进一步更真实地体会到这是光荣的革命任务。”振华印刷厂的工人代表说：“我这次参加会议感到很光荣，使我充分看到党内是非常民主的。刘澜涛同志的报告使我很感动，我从前工作拖拉，粗枝大叶，以后一定要细心起来，团结非党群众，把工作做好。”代表和党员们也一致表示：要以实际行动来实现代表大会的决议，把大会的精神贯彻到机关的各种工作中去。
    对大会决议和报告的认真传达与学习，是贯彻大会精神与决议的重要环节。这种传达讨论，正在全机关结合思想检查和建立新的工作制度进行着，新的直属党委正计划在全体党员中进一步组织与进行这项工作。
