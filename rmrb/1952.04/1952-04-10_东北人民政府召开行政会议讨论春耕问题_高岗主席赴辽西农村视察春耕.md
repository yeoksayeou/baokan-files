Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 8th. The Northeast People's Government held its 23rd administrative meeting on the 2nd to discuss spring plowing and other issues. Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, pointed out at the meeting: This year, the Northeast is required to complete the agricultural production tasks of increasing grain production by 20 million tons and cotton production by 120,000 tons. The guiding principle for increasing production is to improve yield per unit area. Therefore, it is necessary to do a good job in fertilization, seed selection, and other work that have a significant relationship with improving yield per unit area. We must strengthen the specific leadership of spring plowing and conduct in-depth inspections and supervision, and we must not allow it to develop freely or be blindly optimistic. Regarding the issue of mutual aid and cooperation, Lin Feng said: This year, the large-scale development is still of year-round mutual aid teams or combined teams, and the organization of agricultural production cooperatives is still of a demonstration nature. Agricultural production cooperatives must be organized and developed in a focused and led manner based on the principles of farmers' voluntariness and mutual benefit, under the conditions that the masses have relatively rich mutual aid experience and relatively strong leadership backbones. If the subjective and objective conditions are not met, and blind and excessive development is carried out, it will inevitably cause the development of agricultural production cooperatives to take detours. Each province can only pilot one or two collective farms to accumulate experience. In addition, Lin Feng also called on local governments and the masses to do a good job in fire prevention, forest protection, tree planting, and afforestation, and to ensure the completion of grain purchase tasks.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 8th. Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, personally went to the rural areas of Tieling County, Western Liaoning Province on April 6th to inspect spring plowing. When Gao Gang arrived at Hei Niu Quan Village, it was the time when farmers were resting after lunch. He immediately invited more than ten people, including the village head, members of the agricultural production cooperative, members of the mutual aid team, and individual farmers, to talk. The farmers excitedly reported to him the production situation of the whole village and expressed their confidence in striving for a good harvest this year. After inquiring in detail about the family life of each farmer, Gao Gang earnestly said to everyone: This year, we must apply more manure, take good care of the land, run the mutual aid teams well, produce more grain, increase income, and further improve our lives. He also gave specific instructions on issues such as organizing agricultural production cooperatives, planting cotton, and the work of the village people's government.

    东北人民政府召开行政会议讨论春耕问题
    高岗主席赴辽西农村视察春耕
     【新华社沈阳八日电】东北人民政府在二日召开第二十三次行政会议，讨论春耕等问题。东北人民政府副主席林枫在会上指出：今年东北要求完成增产粮食二千万吨，皮棉十二万吨的农业生产任务。增产的方针是提高单位面积产量。因此，必须做好和提高单位面积产量有重大关系的施肥、选种等工作，必须加强对春耕的具体领导和深入检查督促，决不能放任自流、盲目乐观。对于互助合作问题，林枫说：今年大量发展的仍然是长年互助组或联组，组织农业生产合作社还是示范性质。农业生产合作社必须根据农民的自愿和互利的原则，在群众有比较丰富的互助经验、有比较坚强的领导骨干的条件下，有重点有领导地来组织和发展，如果不顾主客观的条件是否具备，盲目地过多地发展，必然会使农业生产合作社的发展走弯路。集体农庄每省只能试办一两个，以积累经验。此外，林枫还号召各地人民政府和群众要做好防火护林植树造林工作和保证完成购粮任务。
    【新华社沈阳八日电】东北人民政府主席高岗在四月六日亲赴辽西省铁岭县农村视察春耕。高岗到达黑牛圈村时，正值农民午后歇晌，随即邀集该村村长、农业生产合作社社员、互助组组员和个体农民共十余人谈话。农民们兴奋地向他报告了全村的生产情况，都表示有信心争取今年的丰收。高岗在详细地询问了每一个农民的家庭生活情形后，恳切地向大家说：今年一定要多上粪，把地侍弄好，把互助组办好，多打粮食，增加收入，进一步改善生活。他对组织农业生产合作社、植棉以及村人民政府的工作等问题，都作了具体的指示。
