    The Working Class Smashed the "Asbestos Throne"
    Ding Yu, Lin Mo

    In the hallway of the luxurious residence of Zhou Jinting, the big asbestos profiteer, there was embedded a piece of white marble, on which was engraved a congratulatory message from a group of asbestos merchants, calling him the "Asbestos Throne." Zhou Jinting also had these four characters engraved on his ivory seal. Obviously, he regarded himself as the "Asbestos Throne." For several years, through various illegal activities, he occupied asbestos producing areas, manipulated production and sales markets, and almost completely monopolized the asbestos industry, which is very important for national defense and heavy industry.

    Taking the North China region as an example, there are a total of ten public and private asbestos factories, nine of which are private. Among these nine, seven were controlled by Zhou Jinting: five in Tianjin, namely Zhenye, Chunhua, Dehua, Zhenxing, and Ruiji, and two in Beijing, namely Zhizhong and Sanming. Zhou Jinting was the factory director of Beijing Zhizhong Asbestos Factory, the chairman of Beijing Sanming Asbestos Company, the general manager of Tianjin Zhenye Asbestos Company, and the chairman of the Tianjin Asbestos Industry Joint Association (composed of the above-mentioned five private asbestos factories in Tianjin). The seven asbestos factories controlled by Zhou Jinting not only manipulated the asbestos production and sales in North China, but also constituted the largest asbestos monopoly group in the country. Zhou Jinting once said triumphantly: "If you want to buy asbestos, you must find me."

    Starting from Speculation and Deception

    Zhou Jinting was originally the son of a grocer in a small county town in Northeast China. He followed his father in business from an early age. Later, he became an adjutant under Yang Yuting, a warlord in Northeast China, and absconded to Tianjin with a huge sum of money. Soon after, he joined forces with a petty bureaucrat named Ren Futing to contract the tobacco and alcohol tax for the entire territory of Tianjin for three years, from which he made a big profit. Starting in 1934, he began to get involved in the asbestos industry, partnering with others to operate the asbestos mine in Laiyuan County, Hebei Province. In 1935, he partnered with Ren Futing and others to take over an asbestos factory in Tianjin called Kuiyelong and renamed it Zhenye Asbestos Factory. In less than a year, Zhou Jinting, relying on the influence of Ren Futing (who was then the "Director of Construction" in the puppet Ji East government), kicked others out of the Zhenye factory. Subsequently, he used insidious means to annex Tianjin Zhonghua Asbestos Factory and seize the two branches of Tianjin Ruiji Asbestos Factory in Shanghai and Hankou.

    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Zhou Jinting colluded with the Kuomintang bandit army and took advantage of the situation to buy two asbestos factories left by the Japanese invaders in Tianjin at a low price. Because the asbestos industry was not profitable at the time, he wore a Chiang bandit army "colonel" uniform and engaged in speculation in gold in Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places.

    Monopolizing Asbestos Mines

    After liberation, the asbestos industry improved, and Zhou Jinting concentrated his efforts on monopolizing this industry. He tried to monopolize and acquire several of the largest and best asbestos mines that had already been mined (asbestos mines in Xikang, Sichuan, Hebei, Rehe, etc.), and squeeze out other merchants. He had signed a purchase contract with an asbestos mine in Hebei. The contract stipulated that all the asbestos produced must be sold to Zhou Jinting's monopoly group and not to other merchants. In order to monopolize Sichuan and Xikang asbestos, he set up a Sichuan-Xikang office in Chengdu. The fiber length of asbestos produced in Xikang is the best in the country. At the beginning of liberation, Xikang asbestos was in short supply everywhere. Zhou Jinting first sent people to Chengdu to buy it up, and then sent people to Xikang to bribe certain cadres of the Xikang Trading Company, grabbing a large amount of Xikang asbestos and transporting it to Beijing and Tianjin, where it was sold at several times or even more than ten times the price.

    In order to monopolize the asbestos mine in Sichuan, Zhou Jinting sent managers to collude with the local feudal secret society leaders, bribing the former and subsequent county magistrates, deputy director of the public security bureau, county captain, director of the tax bureau, manager of the People's Bank, and district chief of the first district (asbestos mining area) in the county where the mine was located, so that the people's government, army, and bank of the county would all serve him. In 1950, there was a famine in the area, and many farmers were eating grass roots and "Guanyin soil" to survive. Zhou Jinting's agent, Hu Jitang, borrowed a huge sum of money from the county People's Bank and bought 2,000 dan of rice in the area, raising the price of rice and exacerbating the famine. He also used rice as bait to recruit a large number of famine victims to mine for him, cruelly exploiting their blood and sweat, but euphemistically called it "work relief." Hu Jitang wrote to Zhou on September 23, 1950, reporting that "the county government instructed the district office to send Captain Fan as a military representative to the asbestos mine, summoning representatives of asbestos mine owners and hundreds of workers to a meeting, which was very successful. Any mine owners, etc., who mine for me, if they sell asbestos privately or sell it at a high price, will be severely punished according to the law if found out."

    Zhou Jinting feared that the increase in mine production would affect his monopoly on asbestos prices, and repeatedly wrote letters ordering Hu Jitang to find ways to limit mine production. He wanted Hu to "contact the mine" and "keep its output at ten to twenty tons per month" because "if mining exceeds, it must be sold at a lower price."

    In order to monopolize asbestos mines, Zhou Jinting tried every means to prevent other manufacturers from acquiring and mining asbestos. When he heard that a merchant from Shanghai was going to Sichuan to purchase asbestos wool, he immediately wrote to Hu Jitang saying: "Shen (Shanghai) Sun Shoutong is going to Sichuan to buy wool, and we must resist." He wanted Hu to "sign an exclusive sales contract" with the mine so that the mine "must not have any orders or sales with others." After Hu Jitang made arrangements, Shanghai asbestos merchants ran into walls everywhere in the Sichuan market, and no one dared to sell to them. When they asked Hu Jitang to share some, they were refused; when they applied to the county government, they were not approved. Hu Jitang wrote to Zhou reporting that "any mines that have been mined in this area cannot be infringed upon by any manufacturer; our factory has priority, and I control it economically."

    After Zhou Jinting achieved the purpose of preventing other manufacturers from purchasing, he feared that others would directly invest in mining, so he wrote a letter instructing Hu Jitang: "Someone from Shanghai, Tang, is going to mine asbestos... Upon seeing the letter, immediately consult with the responsible comrades on appropriate methods... It is imperative that no one else be allowed to mine."

    In this way, Zhou Jinting completely monopolized an asbestos mine in a certain county in Sichuan in 1950.

    A Sinister Illegal Monopoly Group

    Because the sales of asbestos products were booming after liberation, the five private asbestos factories in Tianjin were constantly fighting each other and抢生意. Zhou Jinting felt that this competition was not conducive to him, so he officially came forward in 1949 and organized a joint asbestos monopoly group.

    This monopoly group stipulated six "cooperation" methods: Any company that sells more than half a ton of asbestos powder at ordinary times is within the scope of "cooperation"; other products, except for retail sales and sales to private hardware stores, are within the scope of "cooperation"; all those within the scope of cooperation must be sold at the agreed price, and profits must be contributed in accordance with the prescribed ratio, and at a certain period, the profits contributed by each company will be distributed in accordance with the prescribed ratio. The stipulated profit sharing ratio is: Zhenye gets 35%, Chunhua and Dehua each get 20%, Zhenxing gets 15%, and Ruiji gets 10%. Later, in order to seize the Beijing market, they pulled in Beijing Sanming Asbestos Company, stipulating that Sanming could get 15% of the profits from sales within Beijing. The remaining amount would be distributed by the Tianjin factories in the original proportion.

    The regulations on sales prices in their joint bidding methods were extremely strict. If any company sold goods below the prescribed price, it would have to compensate the shortfall to each company after investigation. However, there was no restriction on selling at high prices. The goods sold by each company within the scope of cooperation must be reported to Li Yanan, manager of Chunhua, who would keep accounts and distribute profits when the time came. If any company was found to have sold goods privately without reporting, all the proceeds would be confiscated.

    They met once a week in the form of a "dinner party" to discuss ways to steal state property. This organization manipulated the asbestos market in North China, defrauding the state at high prices. When a certain inspector of the Tianjin Haihe Engineering Bureau was more careful when receiving goods, they resented it and wickedly decided that all goods sold to the Haihe Engineering Bureau would be marked up by 50%. The Haihe Engineering Bureau had to buy it for work needs.

    According to incomplete statistics, in 1950 alone, Zhou Jinting's monopoly group shared more than 4.6 billion yuan in illegal profits. Zhou Jinting and other factories earned a lot more illegal profits. In their own words, "all the factory managers got rich." At the end of the year, each company took turns hosting banquets to celebrate. The managers of Zhenxing and Dehua factories held several banquets with dishes costing 1.6 to 1.7 million yuan per table.

    They feared that this lucrative business would not last long, so in January 1951, they further established the "Tianjin Asbestos Industry Joint Association," putting a legal guise on the monopoly group and continuing to engage in various illegal activities.

    Astonishing Illegal Profits

    Zhou Jinting was not satisfied with this little profit. He learned about market conditions at any time through Wang Yanling, a "mole" he had placed in the Tianjin Trust Company. Whichever goods were in short supply, he secretly bought them up and hoarded them. He grabbed rubber, grabbed pigments, and also grabbed hardware. It has now been discovered that he hoarded as many as 14 or 15 kinds of materials in various places. Some of them had already rotted (because the price was not high, he would rather let them rot than sell them). At the beginning of 1950, he bought up all the rock wool (also known as "glass asbestos") on the Beijing and Tianjin markets and hoarded it. He originally bought it for 500 to 600 yuan per catty; while the Electric Power Administration Bureau, which urgently needed this material, had to buy it from him for 100,000 yuan per catty. The illegal profit was as high as more than 160 times!

    After purchasing asbestos raw materials at low prices from Sichuan, which he monopolized, he first transported them to Beijing Zhizhong Asbestos Factory, mixed them with sand, and sold them to the board of directors of Tianjin Zhenye Asbestos Company at a higher price. The board of directors then sold them to Zhenye Company at a higher price (the board of directors could use this method to illegally escape funds). The company then produced inferior finished products by cutting corners and raised prices without restriction in an illegal joint bidding manner, severely defrauding the state. A batch of asbestos he purchased from Sichuan, with a purchase price plus freight of 240 million yuan, was sold at 600 million yuan at the Zhizhong factory, obtaining huge illegal profits. The illegal profit of No. 3 asbestos wool sold by the Tianjin Asbestos Industry Joint Association after processing at Zhenye Company was as high as 1,329%!

    Cutting Corners and Damaging Production

    Few of the various products of Zhou Jinting's asbestos factory were not cut corners. He used adulterated and bad goods to damage the country's industrial production, harming the volunteers and harming the workers. Our air force wanted to buy asbestos cloth from him to wrap aircraft engines to prevent the extreme cold at high altitudes. Our tank drivers had to wear asbestos clothing to insulate themselves from the high heat caused by shelling. But these asbestos cloths were made with a large amount of waste cotton, losing their due effectiveness. It could cause aircraft accidents and prevent tank drivers from fighting the enemy.

    Pan Changyou, a model worker at the Tianjin Steel Plant, wore a set of asbestos clothing made by Zhou Jinting's Zhenye Asbestos Company to heat-repair the Martin furnace. Because the asbestos clothing was woven with a large amount of waste cotton thread, the asbestos clothing, which was marked as being able to withstand 500 to 700 degrees of heat, caught fire as soon as Pan Changyou touched the furnace door. Because Pan Changyou was very alert, he was not harmed.

    Zhou Jinting's asbestos monopoly group often sold a large number of inferior products to important industrial departments such as railway bureaus, steel plants, and electric power bureaus. These asbestos products were used in important parts such as locomotives, boiler steam, high-pressure steam pipe insulation, heat insulation, and interfaces, as well as electrical insulation parts. However, these products were all heavily adulterated. Hemp knives and waste paper were mixed in asbestos tiles, old cotton was mixed in asbestos ropes and asbestos cloth, and white soil, talc powder, lime, and dust were mixed in asbestos powder in large quantities. Zhou Jinting said basely and shamelessly: "We can even sell sweeping dirt for money."

    To sell such bad things, bribery and deception were necessary. Zhou Jinting was a "master" in this regard. More than 15,000 copper-bone asbestos tiles sold to the Tianjin Railway Bureau Materials Factory in 1949 had excessive impurities, resulting in cracks, falling edges, missing corners, and inconsistent thicknesses in the finished products, with not one in a hundred being complete. However, Zhou Jinting bribed Xiao Yinzhai, the warehouse director of the Materials Factory, who only checked the numbers when receiving the goods and did not investigate anything else. When packaging asbestos powder, Zhou Jinting first put a bottomless iron bucket in the middle of the package, filled the bucket with bad powder, covered the outside of the bucket with a layer of good powder, then pulled out the iron bucket, and covered it with another layer of good powder. They called this "dressing" and "wearing a hat."

    Zhou Jinting used various similar methods to send a large number of bad goods into the state's warehouses.

    Zhou Jinting's Factory Was Like a Prison

    In Zhou Jinting's factory, workers' health, welfare, and political rights were completely out of the question.

    Beijing Zhizhong Asbestos Factory was established and personally managed by Zhou Jinting in 1950 with his own investment. This factory was like a prison. Before the establishment of the factory's grassroots trade union in May 1951, workers were only allowed to ask for two hours of leave on Sunday evenings. This was their only rest time. Most of the workers in this factory were young female workers, all of whom Zhou Jinting had recruited from Tianjin. When they entered the factory, each person had to provide a guarantor and a guarantor, and sign a guarantee. The above stipulates: "Only the capitalist is allowed to dismiss workers, and workers are not allowed to quit."

    The working conditions of Tianjin Zhenye Asbestos Company and Beijing Zhizhong Asbestos Factory were extremely harsh. The room for making asbestos ash was kept with closed doors and windows. When working, asbestos powder and talc powder flew all over the room, and people could not see each other's faces. The asbestos powder blurred the workers' eyes, and the workers poked each other with small sticks. Sometimes the workers opened the windows to let some air in, but Zhou Jinting would not allow it, saying that it would blow away his asbestos powder. The workers asked for masks. Zhou Jinting said: "Asbestos reduces fire, it doesn't matter if you eat a little bit!" Sometimes the workers were so choked that they grabbed a handful of cotton and covered their mouths. In addition to working ten hours a day as required, the female workers of the Zhizhong factory had to be sent to Zhou Jinting's residence to sweep the floor, wipe the floor tiles, wipe the glass, and act as laundry and other labor.

    Working in the asbestos dust for a long time would lead to lung disease, stomach disease, and eye disease. The results of a hospital examination of workers at Zhenye Company in May 1951 showed that 49 out of 167 workers had lung disease (four workers died of lung disease before and after), 80% had stomach disease, and others had eye and heart diseases. Every month, workers who went to the doctor accounted for 90% of the total number of people in the company.

    We visited the cotton spinning room of Factory 1 of Tianjin Zhenye Company. There were sixty or so female workers spinning asbestos thread here. The workshop was filled with asbestos fibers, and the sound of workers coughing could be heard everywhere in the factory. There was a female worker who coughed very badly. Her face was sallow and thin, with big eyes and bloodless lips. Her name was Qi Muzhen, and she had lung disease. Every time she went to the doctor, the doctor told her that she needed to rest. But she had to eat, so she had to work hard to support herself. The workers told us that there used to be a female worker named Liu Wushi in this workshop who got a very serious lung disease, coughed up blood, and was later fired. Deputy Manager Zhao Hengze said to her: "If you die in the factory, we still have to buy you a coffin!"

    Cruel Exploitation

    Zhou Jinting once divided workers into eleven types, with different pay for the same work, and many workers could be dismissed at any time. Short-term workers could be dismissed after one day; temporary workers could be dismissed after one month; seasonal workers could be dismissed after three months. These three types of workers did the same work as long-term workers, but their wages were very different. The average daily wage of a long-term worker was 13,000 yuan, while the daily wage of a short-term worker was only 7,000 yuan. Many workers had been working in the factory for two or three years, but their titles had always been "short-term worker" or "temporary worker." In 1949 and 1950, there were often forty or fifty workers working in Factory 2 of Zhenye Company, but there were only three long-term workers.

    Zhou Jinting hired a large number of short-term and temporary workers, partly to pay less wages, and partly because of the speculative nature of his production. The workers said that he "worked when the profits were high, and scattered when the profits were low." Workers were often threatened with unemployment. Some workers who were dismissed in the winter borrowed money, sold clothes, and let their wives live with their parents. Zhao Hongqi, a worker, went to sell blood last winter after being dismissed, selling 250 cc at a time.

    The thread spinning workers in Factory 1 of Zhenye Company were paid by the piece, and they struggled to earn only five or six thousand yuan a day. Because the money they earned was not enough to make a living, some workers entered the factory at two or three o'clock in the morning and returned at eight or nine o'clock in the evening, working for as long as fifteen or sixteen hours. The female worker Liu Chen said: "We come with the stars and go with the stars, and we eat dry steamed buns when we are hungry and drink cold water when we are thirsty." The capitalists still tried to deduct the wages of these piece-rate workers. Zhao Hengze, deputy manager of Factory 1, and others often lowered the quality and quantity of the thread when the workers handed in the thread. The grade of thread spun by the workers was entirely determined by the capitalist and there was no standard. The scales used in the factory only had four, eight, twelve, and sixteen ounce marks. When weighing the thread, anything less than eight ounces was counted as four ounces; anything less than twelve ounces was counted as eight ounces. When the workers argued, Zhao Hengze would scold fiercely: "Stinky workers, what are you shouting for!" "You are fed and fattened, it's time to get out of the pen!" Sometimes, when he lost his temper, he would reduce the grade of all the workers' thread from grade 1 to grade 3 (the wages for grade 3 thread are 60% less than grade 1 thread). Whoever resisted would be even more unlucky next time they handed in the thread. The female worker Liu Huang said: "We spin thread with tears in our eyes, earning this money while being bullied. Sometimes, when I get angry, I really can't go on. But then I think that there is nothing to eat at home, so I have to grit my teeth and keep going." The female worker Li Ji said: "Whenever I think about this, my heart is filled with tears." Li Ji cried for half a month because the capitalists' reduction of weight and grade was not resolved, and she did not go to work. Liu Chen got sick from anger and lay down for three months in a row. When we went to investigate recently, Li Ji had just recovered from her illness and returned to work not long ago. With tears in her eyes, she said breathlessly:

    "Zhou Laoba (Zhou Jinting), the big tiger, he eats our flesh and drinks our blood, we are living on the edge of his knife! Now we are grateful to our Chairman Mao, who sees clearly and calls for the 'Five-Anti's', which opened the tiger's den and caught the tiger, and we can see the light of day!"

    Tyrannical Rule

    In Zhou Jinting's factory, workers had no political freedom. Zhou Jinting did not allow workers to participate in learning. When he saw workers reading progressive books, he said: "You are not allowed to read these evil books!" He did not even allow workers to buy public bonds. He often listened to and spread "Voice of America" and used various rumors to threaten workers. He openly said: "My factory is not allowed to have Party and League members!" Once, he saw a worker wearing a trade union badge and asked: "Can you not eat if you don't wear it?" He forced the worker to take off the trade union badge immediately. After the Beijing Zhizhong Asbestos Factory started work, the superior trade union cadres went to contact the workers to organize a trade union. They went five times in a row, but Zhou Jinting blocked them at the door. He said: "The machines inside are being tested and have not yet started work." Sun Lanqiu, a worker at the factory, secretly discussed organizing a trade union with others. After Zhou Jinting discovered this, he spread rumors to Sun Lanqiu's family, saying that Sun Lanqiu was having illicit relationships with men and women in the factory, forcing Sun Lanqiu to resign voluntarily.

    Zhou Jinting also arranged his own henchmen everywhere to monitor the workers. There were the "Wang Brothers" in the Zhenye Company's factory and the "Wang Sisters" in the Beijing Zhizhong Factory. In the past, workers called them the "Wang Party."

    The "Wang Brothers" were hooligans and thugs, who usually acted tyrannically and no one dared to provoke them. Even after Zhou Jinting was arrested during the "Five-Anti's" Movement, some of them were still sabotaging the "Five-Anti's." The "Wang Sisters" were group leaders and subgroup leaders sent by Zhou Jinting to manage the workers at the Zhizhong Factory. Their task was to monitor the workers and report to Zhou Jinting.

    Shameless Deception

    Zhou Jinting's Zhenye Asbestos Company also had a most powerful means of dealing with workers, which was to exploit loopholes in the government and the trade union. In this regard, Zhou Jinting had a most effective assistant, who was Gao Zhifu, the deputy manager of Zhenye Company.

    Gao Zhifu had read all the policies and decrees of the People's Government and knew how to use theoretical terms. Whenever workers asked for any welfare or had any negotiations with the capitalists, he would use a set of "theories" to block the workers. For example, when the workers asked for a wage increase, he said that the bourgeoisie was one of the four friends, and the workers could not struggle with the bourgeoisie. Zhenye Company originally had 120 thread spinning workers. Before the implementation of the Labor Insurance Regulations, the capitalists wanted to exclude this group of thread spinning workers from the company's formal workers, so that the company's total number of workers would not exceed 100, so that the Labor Insurance Regulations could not be implemented. This deceptive method was not approved by the government, and Zhou Jinting and others shouted: "The implementation of labor insurance will increase production costs!" "This is a regulation that destroys industry and commerce!" "This is a crisis for Zhenye Company!" After discussion, they decided that Gao Zhifu would "persuade" the company's trade union cadres, and submit a document to the Tianjin Labor Bureau. The document falsely claimed that the female workers participating in thread spinning were engaged in household sideline production, not formal workers in the factory, and that many of them did not meet the standards of formal workers in terms of age, skills, physique, and working hours. Therefore, in order to count them as formal workers and implement the Labor Insurance Regulations, the factory had to conduct a screening examination. Those who did not meet the standards would have to be dismissed by the capitalists in order to avoid hindering production. The Labor Bureau agreed to their screening of workers without investigation and research. Thus, Zhou Jinting and Gao Zhifu, under the banner of the Labor Bureau, instigated the company's trade union cadres to come forward and, after a screening, dismissed 14 thread spinning workers. These dismissed workers always believed that "the Labor Bureau dismissed us when it implemented the Labor Insurance Regulations."

    Zhou Jinting was not satisfied with dismissing these workers. He and Gao Zhifu also discussed using the deceptive method of "improving production and signing labor-capital contracts" to dismiss workers. In the labor-capital contract drafted by Gao Zhifu, one-third of the clauses were about dismissal. The contract stipulated that workers could be "dismissed by the capitalists" for casually making noise, going out to buy snacks, three absences, or substandard thread spinning; finally, if the roving frame in the factory was started, then "all would be dismissed." Therefore, the workers called it the "Dismissal Contract." Later, after many discussions, the workers saw through their trap and resolutely refused to sign, and the capitalists' conspiracy did not succeed.

    The Working Class Smashed the "Asbestos Throne"

    Zhou Jinting's ability to monopolize the asbestos industry was the result of his attacks on the working class and the state in all aspects. He was "fully poisoned" in bribery, tax evasion, theft of state property, cutting corners, and theft of state economic intelligence. His total illegal income is estimated to be approximately 10 billion yuan. His monopolistic, speculative, and destructive nature in production, as well as his appalling oppression and illegal exploitation of workers, fully demonstrate that he wanted to usurp economic leadership and develop along the road of monopoly capital. The people's country will never allow the wishes of people like Zhou Jinting to be realized. In the "Five-Anti's" Movement, no matter how Zhou Jinting distorted policies and resisted in every possible way, the broad masses of employees finally straightened their backs under the support and leadership of the Communist Party and thoroughly exposed his various illegal crimes. Wang Zeheng, the trade union chairman who had been deceived and used by Zhou Jinting in the past, as well as several other employees, have also awakened, stood on the position of the working class, and begun to fight against Zhou Jinting.

    The big profiteer Zhou Jinting has been arrested by the Tianjin People's Court because he resolutely refused to confess his crimes. He will receive the punishment he deserves.

    工人群众打垮了“石棉王座”
    丁羽  林沫
    在石棉业大奸商周锦庭的华丽住宅的走廊墙壁上，嵌着一块汉白玉石，上面刻着一群石棉商给他送的贺词，称他为“石棉王座”。周锦庭又把这四个字刻在自己的象牙图章上。显然，他是以“石棉王座”自命的。数年来，他通过种种违法活动，霸占石棉产地，操纵生产和销售市场，把对国防和重工业十分重要的石棉工业几乎完全垄断了。
    拿华北区来说，公、私营石棉工厂共有十家，其中有九家是私营的。在这九家中，被周锦庭掌握和控制了的就有七家：在天津的有振业、春华、德华、振兴、瑞记等五家，在北京的有至中、三明两家。周锦庭是北京至中石棉厂厂长、北京三明石棉公司董事长、天津振业石棉公司总经理、天津石棉工业联营社（由上述天津五家私营石棉厂组成）主任委员。周锦庭所掌握的这七家石棉厂，不仅操纵了华北区的石棉生产和销售，就全国来说，他们也是势力最大的一个石棉垄断集团。周锦庭曾得意忘形地说：“要买石棉，必须找我。”
    投机坑骗起家
    周锦庭原是东北某小县城一个杂货商的儿子，自小跟着他父亲学买卖。后来在东北军阀杨宇霆手下当副官，拐巨款逃到天津。不久，又拉上一个名叫任甫亭的小官僚，合伙包了三年天津全境的烟酒税，从中大捞了一把。从一九三四年开始，他开始插足石棉业，和人合伙经营河北省涞源县的石棉矿。一九三五年，又和任甫亭等合伙，把天津一家名叫魁业隆的石棉厂接兑过来，改名为振业石棉厂。干了不到一年，周锦庭就借着任甫亭的势力
    （任这时在伪冀东政府当“建设厅长”），把别人从振业厂踢了出去。接着，他又用阴谋手段吞并了天津中华石棉厂，夺取了天津瑞记石棉厂设在上海和汉口的两个分厂。
    抗日战争胜利以后，周锦庭又勾结国民党匪军，仗势贱价收买了日寇遗留在天津的两个石棉厂。因为石棉业当时不赚钱，他又穿着蒋匪军“上校”军服，在天津上海等地捣卖黄金，做投机生意。
    垄断石棉矿山
    解放以后，石棉业营业好转，周锦庭就集中力量来垄断这一行业。他对已经开采的几个最大和最好的石棉矿（西康、四川、河北、热河等地的石棉矿），设法垄断收购，排挤其他商家。他曾和河北的一个石棉矿订过包购合同。合同规定：出产的石棉，必须全部卖给周锦庭的垄断集团，不得卖给其他商家。为着垄断川、康石棉，他在成都设立了川康办事处。西康出的石棉，纤维长度在全国数第一。解放之初，各地西康石棉奇缺。周锦庭先派人在成都抢购，继又派人深入西康，贿赂西康贸易公司的某些干部，把大批西康石棉抢到自己手里，运到北京、天津，以数倍以至十多倍的高价出售。
    为着垄断四川的石棉矿，周锦庭派经理人员和当地的封建会门头子相勾结，贿赂了矿区所在县的前后两任县长、公安局副局长、县大队长、税务局长、人民银行经理、一区（石棉矿区）区长等负责人员，使该县的人民政权、军队、银行，都为他服务。一九五零年当地有灾荒，很多农民吃草根和“观音土”度日。周锦庭的代理人胡吉堂就向县人民银行贷了巨款，在当地抢购食米两千担，抬高米价，加重灾荒。又拿食米当钓饵，招来大批灾民给他们挖矿，残酷地榨取灾民的血汗，却美其名曰“以工代赈”。胡吉堂一九五零年九月二十三日写信向周报告说：“县府指令区署派范队长为石棉矿山军事代表，招集开采石棉厂户代表及工人数百人开会，甚圆满。凡是给我开采的厂户等，如有自行私卖石棉或高价出售者，查出依法重办。”
    周锦庭惟恐矿山生产量增加，会影响他垄断石棉价格，曾一再去信，命令胡吉堂设法限制矿山生产。要胡“与矿山接洽”，“使其产量每月以十吨至二十吨为度”。因“开采过剩，势须落价卖出”。
    周锦庭为独霸石棉矿山，曾多方设法抵制其他厂商去收购和开采石棉。他听说上海有商人到四川采购石棉绒，就马上去信给胡吉堂说：“申（上海）孙寿桐去川购绒，我方须作一抵制。”他要胡与矿方
    “签订独家经售合同”，使矿方“不得再与他人有定货或销货情事”。胡吉堂做了布置后，上海石棉商在四川的市场上到处碰壁，谁也不敢卖给他们。向胡吉堂要求分让，遭到拒绝；向县府申请，也得不到批准。胡吉堂曾写信向周报告说：“凡此地已开采矿山，任何厂商非能侵犯；我厂有优先权，我以经济控制。”
    周锦庭抵制其他厂商采购的目的达到以后，又怕别人直接投资开矿，于是又写信指使胡吉堂：“上海汤某去开采石棉，……见函即与各负责同志洽商相当办法。……决不能允许他人开采，是为至要。”
    就这样，周锦庭在一九五零年完全垄断了四川某县石棉矿。
    罪恶的非法垄断集团
    因为解放以后石棉制品销路畅旺，天津五家私营石棉厂之间不断地互相打架，抢生意。周锦庭感到这样竞争对自己不利，就在一九四九年正式出面，组织了联合的石棉垄断集团。
    这个垄断集团曾规定了六条“合作”办法：各家平时出售石棉粉在半吨以上的，即属“合作”范围；其他产品除门市零售及售与私营五金行外，均属“合作”范围；凡在合作范围内的，都得按照议定价格出售，并按规定比例提出红利，到一定时期，将各家所提出的红利按规定比例分配。其规定分红的比例是：振业得百分之三十五，春华、德华各得百分之二十，振兴得百分之十五，瑞记得百分之十。以后他们为抓取北京的市场，又把北京三明石棉公司拉进去，规定在北京范围内的合标售货，三明可分得红利的百分之十五。下剩数目，天津各厂按原比例分。
    他们在合标办法中对售货价格的规定是极为严格的。如有那家低于规定价格售货，经查出后，须将少卖的钱赔出，分给各家。但高价出售则不限制。各家在合作范围内所售出的货，必须随时向春华经理李雅南报告，由他记账，到时算账分红。如发现那家私自售货不报，则将全部货款没收。
    他们每星期天以“聚餐”的形式集会一次，商量盗骗国家财产的办法。这一组织操纵着华北的石棉市场，以高价坑骗国家。天津海河工程局某验收员在收货时比较认真，他们就怀恨在心，可恶地决定：凡售货给海河工程局，一律加价百分之五十。海河工程局为工作需要不得不买。
    据不完全统计，一九五零年一年，周锦庭这一个垄断集团伙分的非法利润就有四十六亿多元。周锦庭个人及其他厂另外所得的非法利润还很多。用他们自己的话来说，是“各厂经理全吃肥了”。年终结账时，各家曾轮流请客庆祝。振兴、德华两厂经理，曾以一百六、七十万元一桌的酒菜，一连请了数次。
    他们怕这种一本万利的好生意为时不会长，一九五一年一月又进一步成立了“天津石棉工业联营社”，把垄断集团披上了合法的外衣，继续进行各种违法活动。
    惊人的非法利润
    周锦庭并不满足于这点利润。他通过安置在天津市信托公司的“坐探”王延龄，随时了解市场情况。那一种货缺了，他就暗中抢购囤积。他抓橡胶，抓颜料，也抓五金。现已发现的他在各处囤积的物资，有十四、五种之多。有些东西已经霉坏了
    （因为价钱不大，他宁让它烂掉也不卖出）。一九五零年初，他曾把北京、天津市场上所有的岩棉
    （又名“玻璃石棉”）搜购一空，囤积起来。他原来是以五、六百元一斤购进的；而急需此项物资的电业总局不得不以十万元一斤的价格向他购买。非法利润高达一百六十多倍！
    他从他垄断了的四川低价购到石棉原料后，先运到北京至中石棉工厂，掺砂对假，加价卖给天津振业石棉公司董事会，董事会再加价卖给振业公司
    （董事会可以用这办法非法逃出资金），公司再以偷工减料的方法制出劣等成品，用非法合标的方式无限制地提高价格，狠狠地敲诈国家。他们从四川购买的一批石棉，购价加运费共二亿四千万元，在至中厂售出价提到六亿元，获得巨额非法利润；在振业公司加工后，由天津石棉工业联营社卖出的三号石棉绒，非法利润高达百分之一千三百二十九！
    偷工减料破坏生产
    周锦庭的石棉工厂的各种产品很少不经过偷工减料的。他拿掺假的坏货来破坏国家的工业生产，暗害志愿军，暗害工人。我们的空军要从他那里购买石棉布来包裹飞机发动机，以防止高空的严寒。我们的坦克手们要穿用石棉衣来隔避因发炮而引起的高热。但这些石棉布是掺进大量废棉花制成的，失去了应有的效能。它可以使飞机发生事故，使坦克手无法对敌作战。
    天津炼钢厂的劳动模范潘长有，穿着一件由周锦庭的振业石棉公司制作的石棉衣去热修马丁炉。因为石棉衣是掺进大量废棉花线织成的，潘长有刚一挨炉门，这件标定着可以耐火五百度到七百度的石棉衣就着火了。因潘长有很机警，幸未受到危害。
    周锦庭的石棉垄断集团，经常把大量劣质产品售给各铁路局、炼钢厂、电业局等重要工业部门。这些石棉制品是用在机车、锅炉蒸汽、高压汽管的保温、隔热、接口等重要部分及电力绝缘部分的。但是这些制品都大量掺了假。石棉瓦中掺了麻刀、废纸，石棉绳和石棉布中掺了旧棉花，石棉粉中更大量掺了白土、滑石粉、石灰以及尘土。周锦庭卑鄙无耻地说：“我们连扫地土都能卖钱。”
    要把这样坏的东西卖出去，就必须行贿和欺骗。周锦庭在这方面是“能手”。一九四九年卖给天津铁路局材料厂的一万五千多块铜骨石棉瓦，因掺杂过多，成品裂缝、落边、缺角、厚薄不一致，完整的百不抽一。但周锦庭贿买了材料厂仓库主任萧荫斋，在收货时只验数目，其他一概不究。周锦庭在包装石棉粉时，包中间先放一个无底的铁桶，桶内装坏的，桶外装一层好的，然后把铁桶抽出，上面再盖一层好的。他们把这叫作“穿衣”、“戴帽”。
    周锦庭使用各种类似的手法，把大批坏货送进了国家的仓库。
    周锦庭的工厂像牢狱
    在周锦庭的工厂里，工人的健康、福利和政治权利是根本谈不到的。
    北京至中石棉厂，是周锦庭在一九五零年独资开办并亲自管理的。这个工厂活像一座牢狱。在一九五一年五月厂里基层工会成立以前，工人只有在每星期天晚上才可请假外出两小时。这就是她们唯一的休息时间。这厂的工人绝大部分是青年女工，都是周锦庭从天津招来的。她们进厂时，每人都要打上铺保、人保，并立有一份保证书。上面规定：“只许资方解雇工人，不许工人不干。”
    天津振业石棉公司和北京至中石棉厂的劳动条件，都极端恶劣。做石棉灰的屋子，门窗都被关住。工作时，石棉粉和滑石粉满屋飞扬，对面看不见人。石棉粉把工人的眼睛迷糊住了，工人互相用小棍拨弄。工人有时开开窗户通通空气，周锦庭不答应，说是吹跑了他的石棉粉。工人要求发口罩。周锦庭说：“石棉败火，吃到肚里一点不要紧！”有时工人呛得不行了，就抓把棉花捂在嘴上。至中厂的女工们除按规定每天工作十小时外，还要被派去给周锦庭打扫住宅，擦地砖、擦玻璃、以及充当洗衣服等劳役。
    工人在石棉的粉雾中工作久了，就要得肺病、胃病、眼病。一九五一年五月振业公司的工人到医院检查的结果，一百六十七名工人中，有四十九人患肺病（因肺病而死的工人前后有四个），百分之八十的人有胃病，其他还有眼病及心脏病。工人每月看病的占全公司人数的百分之九十。
    我们参观过天津振业公司一厂的纺棉间。这儿有六十来个女工在纺石棉线。工作间满屋飞扬着石棉纤维，厂房里到处可以听到一片工人的咳嗽声。有一个女工，咳嗽很厉害。她脸上黄瘦，大眼，嘴唇无血色。她名叫祁慕珍，有肺病。每次看病时，医生都告诉她需要休息。但她要吃饭，却不能不拚命支持。工人告诉我们，在这车间里曾经有一个叫刘吴氏的女工，因得了很重的肺病，吐血，以后就被解雇了。副理赵恒泽对她说：“你要死在厂里，我们还得给你买棺材哪！”
    残酷的压榨
    周锦庭曾经把工人分为十一种名称，同工不同酬，对很多工人随时都可以解雇。短工，用一天可以解雇；临时工，用一个月可以解雇；季节工，用三个月可以解雇。这三种工人都和长工干同样的活，所得的工资却相差很大。长工一天的工资平均为一万三千元，短工一天只七千元。有很多工人已经在厂内作了二、三年工，名目却一直是“短工”或“临时工”。一九四九年和一九五○年，在振业公司二厂经常作活的有四、五十个工人，长工却只有三个人。
    周锦庭大批雇用短工和临时工，一方面是为了少付工资，另一方面，又和他的生产的投机性分不开。工人说他是“利大了就干，利小了就散”。工人经常受着失业的威胁。有的工人在冬天被解雇了，就借债，卖衣服，让老婆住娘家。工人赵鸿起去年冬天被解雇后，曾去卖血，一次卖了二百五十西西。
    振业公司一厂的纺线工是计件拿工资，她们拚命纺一天才挣五、六千元。因为挣的钱不够维持生活，有的工人在早上两、三点钟就进厂工作，晚上八、九点钟才回去，工作时间长达十五、六小时。女工刘陈氏说：“咱们顶着星星来，顶着星星去，饿了啃口干馍，渴了喝口凉水。”对这些计件工，资方仍要想办法克扣她们的工资。一厂副理赵恒泽等在工人交线时常常压低质量和数量。工人纺的线算那一级，完全由资方决定，并无标准。厂里用的磅秤，只有四两、半斤、十二两、一斤四种符号。在称线时，不到半斤就算四两；不到十二两就算半斤。工人争辩时，赵恒泽就凶恶地骂：“臭工人，叫唤什么！”“你们吃饱养肥了，该出圈了！”有时候他发了脾气，就把全体工人的线由一号降到三号
    （三号线工资比一号线少百分之六十）。谁反抗，下次交线就更要倒霉。女工刘黄氏说：“咱们含着眼泪纺线，挣这几个受气钱。有时气上心头，实在干不下去。但又想起家里没吃的，就只得咬咬牙干下去。”女工李吉氏说：“提起这事，眼泪就淹了心。”李吉氏因为资方压秤、压级的事不得解决，曾哭哭啼啼半个来月，没有上工。刘陈氏则被气病，一连躺了三个月。我们最近去调查的时候，李吉氏才刚病好上班不久。她含着眼泪，上气不接下气地说：
    “周老八（周锦庭）大老虎，他吃我们的肉，喝我们的血，我们是滚在他的刀尖上过日子啊！如今感谢咱毛主席，他眼睛看得清，号召‘五反’，才打开虎窝，捉住了老虎，我们才得见天日了！”
    横暴的统治
    在周锦庭的工厂里，工人没有政治的自由。周锦庭不准工人参加学习。他一见工人看进步书籍，就说：“不许看这些邪书！”连工人买公债他都不许可。他经常收听和散播“美国之音”，并用种种谣言来威胁工人。他公开说：“我的厂子不许党、团员进来！”有一次，他看见一个工人佩带着工会证章，就问：“你不带它能不能吃饭？”强迫工人立时把工会证章摘下来。北京至中石棉厂开工后，上级工会干部要去和工人联系，组织工会。一连去了五次，都被周锦庭挡在门外。他说：“里边正在试验机器，还没有开工。”该厂工人孙兰秋暗中和别人商量组织工会，周锦庭发觉后，就向孙兰秋家里的人造谣，说孙兰秋在厂里乱搞男女关系，迫使孙兰秋自动退职。
    周锦庭还到处安排自己的爪牙，用以监视工人。在振业公司本厂有“王氏三兄弟”，在北京至中厂有“王氏四姊妹”。过去工人称他们是“王党”。
    “王氏三兄弟”是流氓打手，平常横行霸道，无人敢惹。一直到“五反”运动中周锦庭被逮捕以后，他们有的人还在破坏“五反”。“王氏四姊妹”是周锦庭派在至中厂管理工人的大组长、小组长。她们的任务是监视工人，向周锦庭通风报信。
    无耻的欺骗
    周锦庭的振业石棉公司还有一套对付工人的最厉害的手段，就是钻政府和工会的空子。在这方面，周锦庭有一个最得力的助手，就是振业公司的副经理高直夫。
    高直夫熟读了人民政府的各种政策法令，会搬弄理论名词。每当工人要求什么福利或和资方有所交涉，他就用一大套“理论”把工人挡住了。如：工人要求增加工资，他就讲资产阶级是四个朋友之一，工人不可以和资产阶级斗争。振业公司原来有一百二十名纺线工。在实行劳动保险条例之前，资方就想把这一批纺线工不算作厂内的正式工人，使公司的全部工人不超过一百人，这样就可以不实行劳动保险条例。这个欺骗办法没有被政府批准，周锦庭等就大叫：“实行劳动保险要加重生产成本！”“这是摧残工商业的条例！”“这是振业公司的危机！”他们经过讨论，决定一面由高直夫“说服”公司的工会干部，一面向天津市劳动局递呈文。呈文中诡称，参加纺线的女工都是家庭副业生产，不是厂内正式工人，她们在年龄、技术、体格及劳动时间上，很多不够正式工人的标准。因此，要把她们算作正式工人，实行劳动保险条例，必须由厂方来一次甄别考试。不够标准的得由资方解雇，以免妨害生产。劳动局不加调查研究，就同意了他们对工人进行甄别。于是，周锦庭、高直夫就打着劳动局的旗号，唆使公司的工会干部出面，经过一次甄别，把十四个纺线工解雇了。这些被解雇的工人，一直认为是“劳动局实行劳动保险条例把我们解雇的”。
    周锦庭解雇了这些工人，还不满足。他又和高直夫商订出用“改进生产，订立劳资合同”的欺骗办法来解雇工人。在高直夫一手拟定的劳资合同中，有三分之一的条款是关于解雇的。合同规定：工人随便打闹、出外买零食、三次旷工、纺线不合规格等，均可“由资方解雇之”；最后，若厂内粗纱机开动，则得“全体解雇之”。因此，工人把它叫作“解雇合同”。后来经过多次讨论，工人看清楚了他们的圈套，坚决不签字，资方的阴谋才未得实现。
    工人阶级打垮了“石棉王座”
    周锦庭能够垄断石棉业，这是他从各方面向工人阶级和国家进攻的结果。他在行贿、偷税漏税、盗窃国家资财、偷工减料、盗窃国家经济情报等方面，是“五毒俱全”。他的全部非法所得，初步估计约达一百亿元。他在生产上的垄断性、投机性、破坏性和骇人听闻的压迫和非法剥削工人的行为，充分说明他是要想篡夺经济领导权，向独占资本的道路发展。人民的国家，决不能容许周锦庭之流的愿望实现。在“五反”运动中，不管周锦庭怎样歪曲政策，百般抗拒，广大职工群众终于在共产党的支持和领导下，挺起腰来，彻底揭发了他的种种违法罪行。过去受周锦庭欺骗、利用的工会主席王泽恒及其他若干职工，也已觉悟过来，站在工人阶级的立场，开始向周锦庭进行斗争了。
    大奸商周锦庭因为坚不坦白自己的罪行，现已被天津市人民法院逮捕了。他将得到应得的惩处。
