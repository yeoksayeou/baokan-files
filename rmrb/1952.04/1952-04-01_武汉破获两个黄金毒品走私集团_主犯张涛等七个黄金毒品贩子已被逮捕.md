    Wuhan Smashes Two Gold and Drug Smuggling Rings
    Principal Offenders Zhang Tao and Six Other Gold and Drug Traffickers Arrested
    Recently, Wuhan City smashed two large-scale gold and drug smuggling rings. The principal offenders Zhang Tao, Zhang Boqiao, Shen Shaomin, Rui Shiyu, Chen Shiyan, Li Chaozong, Chen Rongfu and others have been arrested and will be brought to justice by the People's Government. One of the gold and drug smuggling rings was organized by Zhang Tao, the Director of the Wuhan City Merchants’ Association. Zhang Tao was a well-known gold and silver dealer in Wuhan, with connections to gold and silver dealers in Shanghai, Tianjin, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and other places. He had been involved in smuggling on the Yuehan (Guangzhou-Hankou) and Xianggui (Hunan-Guangxi) Railways for a long time before Liberation. In June 1950, he colluded with Liu Weihua, Zhang Lianghao, and other gold, silver, and drug offenders to form a smuggling ring, with his younger brother Zhang Boqiao in charge, while Zhang Tao himself planned and directed from behind the scenes. The smuggling transfer station was located at the Gongyaxin Commercial Firm in Dadongjia Lane, Hankou. More than thirty gold and silver dealers transported large quantities of gold from other places and the local area. Zhang Lianghao, residing in Guangzhou, was responsible for secretly transporting gold for export and importing drugs, watches, saccharin, and other goods. To facilitate smuggling, Zhang Tao used old connections from before Liberation, using means such as profit-sharing and stock partnerships to buy off certain railway employees to receive, deliver, and carry money for him. According to preliminary statistics, since Liberation, Zhang Tao's smuggling ring has trafficked over 14,800 taels of gold, 2,300 taels of silver, 1,400 silver dollars, as well as countless amounts of morphine, saccharin, watches, and Western medicine.

    The other gold and drug smuggling ring was composed of seven people: Shen Shaomin (a major gold dealer in Wuhan), Rui Shiyu (Finance Officer of Yuhua Textile Factory), Chen Rongfu (a large cotton yarn speculation profiteer from Shanghai), Chen Shiyan (Manager of the Hechang Flower Firm in Hankou), Guo Ju (Deputy Director of the Finance and Accounting Department of the Trade Department of the Central South Military and Political Committee, former Deputy Manager of the Kuomintang Central Trust Bureau, retained), Zhou Zuyi (Clerk of the Central South Trade Department, former Director of the Savings and Trust Section of the Kuomintang Central Trust Bureau, retained), and Li Chaozong (profiteer of the Fuhua Absorbent Cotton Factory, nephew of Li Yinting). They pooled 2,000 taels of gold as capital and used the "Hechang Flower Firm" at 23 Shengli Street, Hankou, as a cover, with Shen Shaomin as the overall person in charge and Rui Shiyu as the chief accountant, starting smuggling activities in July 1950. Their main activity was the private transportation of gold to Hong Kong. In the second half of 1950, they privately transported gold to Hong Kong four times, totaling more than 12,000 taels. In Hong Kong, they purchased the drug "white powder" (heroin) from Japanese foreign firms, packaged it into bottles, and falsely labeled it as the Japanese product "Weihuo" to transport it back. They also concealed gold in waste cotton and transported it from Hankou to Shanghai twice, totaling 1,700 taels. They also transported opium worth 500 taels of gold concealed in waste cotton to Shanghai. This smuggling ring was connected to the gold and drug smuggling ring Chen Rongfu organized separately in Shanghai. Chen Rongfu had concealed gold in ham and transported it from Shanghai to Hong Kong twice, totaling 2,800 taels. In addition, he transported 160 diamond rings worth 1,700 taels of gold to Hong Kong, exchanging them for the drug "white powder" and smuggling it back into the country. In Shanghai, Chen Rongfu even boldly stole passports under the guise of transporting waste cotton for the New Construction Company, doing his own smuggling of gold to Hong Kong. The smuggling ring organized by Shen Shaomin and others also took advantage of the fluctuation in yarn prices in November 1950, using Guo Ju and Zhou Zuyi to steal important intelligence from the "Confidential Measures for Cotton Yarn in Central South China," transporting 1,200 bales of cotton yarn from Shanghai and Hankou to Guangzhou to seek illegal profits.

    These unscrupulous merchants disrupted financial prices and the cotton yarn market, causing significant losses to the country and the people. Currently, the principal offenders of these two smuggling rings, Zhang Tao, Zhang Boqiao, Shen Shaomin, Rui Shiyu, Chen Shiyan, and Li Chaozong, have been arrested and will be brought to justice by the Central South Branch of the Supreme People's Court. The offender Chen Rongfu has also been arrested and will be brought to justice in Shanghai. (Xinhua News Agency)

    武汉破获两个黄金毒品走私集团
    主犯张涛等七个黄金毒品贩子已被逮捕
    武汉市最近破获两个大规模走私黄金、毒品的集团。主犯张涛、张伯樵、沈绍敏、芮世玉、陈时彦、李朝宗、陈荣福等已被人民政府逮捕法办。一个黄金、毒品走私集团的组织者是武汉市行商商业会主任委员张涛。张涛本是武汉市有名的金银贩子，同上海、天津、重庆、广州、香港等地的金银贩子都有勾结，解放前就长期在粤汉、湘桂铁路上走私。一九五零年六月，他勾结刘维华、张良浩等一批金银、毒品犯成立走私集团，由其弟张伯樵出面负责，张涛本人在幕后策划指挥。走私转运站设在汉口大董家巷公亚新商行。由三十多个金银贩子从外地和本埠大量贩进黄金，由张良浩住广州负责偷运黄金出口和毒品、手表、糖精等进口。为便于走私，张涛利用解放前旧关系，用分赃、搭股等手段收买某些铁路职工为其接货、交货、带钱。据初步材料统计，解放以来，张涛走私集团即贩运黄金一万四千八百多两，白银二千三百两，银元一千四百块，吗啡、糖精、手表、西药等无算。
    另一个黄金、毒品走私集团，是由沈绍敏（武汉大黄金贩子）、芮世玉（裕华纱厂财务专员）、陈荣福（上海大棉纱投机奸商）、陈时彦（汉口合昌花号经理）、郭驹（中南军政委员会贸易部财务会计处副处长，原伪中央信托局副经理，留用）、周祖诒（中南贸易部科员，原伪中央信托局储信科主任，留用）、李朝宗（福华药棉厂奸商、李寅廷之侄）等七人组成的。他们集股二千两黄金为资本，利用汉口胜利街二十三号的“合昌花号”为掩护，由沈绍敏负总责，芮世玉为总账房，在一九五零年七月开始走私活动。平时主要是私运黄金去香港。一九五零年下半年，他们往香港私运黄金四次共一万二千多两；在香港向日本洋行购买毒品白面，封装成瓶，假充日本产品“胃活”运回。他们又将黄金夹入废棉中，由汉口运至上海两次，计一千七百两；又以价值五百两黄金的大烟夹入废棉中运往上海。这个走私集团和陈荣福另在上海组织的黄金、毒品走私集团有联系。陈荣福曾将黄金夹入火腿中由上海运到香港两次，为数达二千八百两；另外又运往香港价值一千七百两黄金的金钢钻戒一百六十个；在香港换成毒品白面后偷运回国。陈荣福在上海并大胆地以替新建公司运废棉出口为名，窃取护照，做他自己私运黄金去香港的勾当。沈绍敏等所组织的走私集团，在一九五零年十一月纱价波动时，还利用郭驹、周祖诒窃取“中南花纱布机密措施”的重要情报，由上海、汉口两地运棉纱一千二百件去广州牟取非法利润。
    这些奸商扰乱金融物价，扰乱棉纱市场，使国家和人民受到重大损失。现这两个走私集团的主犯张涛、张伯樵、沈绍敏、芮世玉、陈时彦、李朝宗等六人已由最高人民法院中南分院予以逮捕法办；陈犯荣福也已在上海被逮捕法办。　（新华社）
