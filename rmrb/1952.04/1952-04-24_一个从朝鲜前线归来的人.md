In Yunnan, there is a person who returned from the Korean front. Because his left hand was disabled, he handed his weapon over to his comrades and left the front lines. Now he picks up a hoe with his right hand to continue fighting in the rear. His name is Gao Xingfa.

Gao Xingfa is the son of a poor peasant from Quxi County, Yunnan. He herded cattle and did odd jobs for landlords since childhood. In 1948, he was conscripted into the Kuomintang army and sent to the Northeast. In October of that year, the troops revolted, and he became a soldier in the People's Liberation Army, joining the Communist Party of China in 1950. During the Jinzhou Campaign, Gao Xingfa was a combatant in the Iron Fist Regiment's sharp knife company; in the Hainan Island liberation campaign, he was a shock troop member on the first boat of Liu Meicun's vanguard battalion crossing the sea. In the advance of more than ten thousand li from the Northeast to Hainan Island, he received three major merits. Later, he joined the Chinese People's Volunteers to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea. He participated in the vanguard force that drove the U.S.-Li bandit troops back south of the 38th parallel. In January 1951, he was wounded and lost his left hand, and that was when he returned to his hometown with several gloriously wounded comrades.

Last October, Gao Xingfa went to work at the Dapu Base Agricultural Experiment Farm, which is under the Yunnan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry. At that time, the farm's tobacco was planted late, and it had not been harvested by the time of the first frost. Gao Xingfa and his partners lit bonfires in the tobacco fields at night to prevent frost. When harvesting tobacco, they braved the morning frost to harvest it, fearing that the frost on the tobacco leaves would dry out and affect the quality. Gao Xingfa said, "The volunteers weren't afraid of sleeping in the snow and ice, how can we be afraid of frost?" Many workers were moved and voluntarily participated in the tobacco harvest. Everyone said, "Old Gao brought the fighting spirit of the most beloved people on the Korean front to the farm."

Seeing that the farm lacked fertilizer, Gao Xingfa got up early every day to collect fertilizer with a manure basket he bought with his own allowance, without interruption from last winter to this year. In four months, he collected more than two thousand catties of manure. In addition, he also led workers to collect scattered peanut vines and corn stalks on the ground for fuel, saving the farm a large amount of firewood. In order to protect the farm's property, he was responsible for directing the work of the farm's security group, and he personally patrolled the farm every night.

Gao Xingfa is responsible for personnel work on the farm. Workers and staff are willing to talk to him about their problems. He also helps everyone patiently and warmly. A worker named Yang Ruilin did not understand technology and planned to leave the farm; but under the education and help of Gao Xingfa, he gradually settled down and mastered the technology. Gao Xingfa saw that some workers were wearing thin clothes and broken shoes, so he gave his only overcoat, shirt, and shoes to the workers. When workers were sick, he often took out his own allowance to buy medicine. Gao Xingfa cares for and loves everyone, but he himself is very hardworking and simple. When he works, he only uses one right hand to grab the hoe, and lifts or presses the hoe handle with his other wrist. Blisters appeared on his hand, but he didn't let anyone see it. The Dapu Base Farm is more than ten kilometers away from Kunming City. Every time he went to Kunming City for a meeting, he rushed back overnight to avoid affecting the next day's work. In his room, there is only a straw mat, a quilt, and a rifle for guarding the farm. He smiled and said to the reporter: "That's what a soldier is like." The quilt was brought back from the Korean front, and it still has the bloodstains from when he was wounded. Last winter, he could have received a new quilt, but he didn't. He pointed to the quilt and said to me: "I want to keep it, which means I am still fighting, and Communists are not allowed to fall behind!"

    一个从朝鲜前线归来的人
    新华社记者  孙肄
    在云南，有一个远从朝鲜前线归来的人。因为左手残废，他把武器交给了战友，离开了前方；现在他用右手拿起锄头在后方继续战斗着。他的名字叫高星发。
    高星发，是云南曲溪县一个贫农的儿子，从小给地主放牛、做活。一九四八年他被国民党拉壮丁送到东北。那年十月里部队起义，他成了人民解放军的战士，一九五○年参加中国共产党。在锦州战役中，高星发是有名的铁拳团尖刀连的战斗员；在解放海南岛战役中，他是刘梅村渡海先锋营第一船上的突击队员。从东北到海南岛万余里进军中，他立过三次大功。以后，他参加了中国人民志愿军抗美援朝，他参加了把美李匪军赶回三八线以南的先遣部队。一九五一年一月他负伤失去了左手，他这才和几个光荣负伤的战友一同回到家乡来。
    去年十月，高星发到云南省农林厅所属的大普基农业试验场工作。那时，农场的烟叶种得迟，到了降霜季节还没有收摘，高星发就和他的伙伴们夜间在烟田里烧起火堆来防霜。收烟时，怕烟叶上的霜晒干了会影响品质，他们冒着晨霜去收。高星发说：“志愿军睡在冰雪里都不怕，我们还能怕落霜吗？”许多工人被感动得也自动参加了收烟。大家说：“老高把朝鲜前线上最可爱的人的战斗精神带到农场来了。”
    高星发看到农场缺乏肥料，每天早起便背着用自己的津贴费买来的粪筐去拾肥，从去年冬天到今年没有间断过。四个月来他拾了两千多斤粪。此外，他还带领工人收集散乱在地里的花生藤和玉米杆，用作燃料，为农场节省了大批木柴。为了保护农场的财产，他负责指挥农场的保卫组的工作，自己每晚都要亲自巡查一周。
    高星发在农场负责人事工作。工人们、职员们有了问题都愿意找他谈话。他也耐心而热诚地帮助大家。有一个名叫杨瑞霖的工人本来不懂技术，打算离开农场；但在高星发的教育和帮助下，他逐渐安心工作，掌握了技术。高星发看到有些工人衣服穿得薄了，鞋子破了，便把自己仅有的大衣、衬衣和鞋子送给工人穿；工人生了病，他常常拿出自己的津贴费去买药。高星发关心和爱护大家，自己却非常艰苦朴素。他干活时只有一只右手抓锄头，另一只手腕抬着或压着锄柄，手上磨起了血泡，他也不让别人看见。大普基农场距昆明市有十几公里，他每次到昆明市开会，都连夜赶回来，以免影响第二天的工作。在他的住室里，只有一个草席，一床被子和一条保卫农场用的步枪。他笑着对记者说：“战士嘛，就是这个样子。”被子是从朝鲜前线带回来的，上面还有他负伤时染下的血痕。去年冬天，他可以领取一条新被子，可是他没有这样作。他指着被子对我说：“我要留着它，这就是说，我还是在作战，共产党员是不许掉队的！”
