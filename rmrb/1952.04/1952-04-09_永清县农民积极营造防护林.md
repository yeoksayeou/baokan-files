    Yongqing County Farmers Actively Build Protective Forests
    In order to combat wind and drought disasters, farmers in Yongqing County, Hebei Province, are actively participating in the construction of the protective forest network downstream of the Yongding River. Nine villages, including Caojiawu, Wangxi, Shayujin, and Zhangchangshen in Yongqing, have each formulated plans for building protective forests and are engaged in mutual competition. Caojiawu plans to build 40 li of protective forests and strive to complete 50 li; Shayujin guarantees to build 30 li of protective forests; Wangxi Village guarantees to organize all labor to complete the planting tasks on time, and ensure a survival rate of over 80%.

    After formulating plans, the peasant masses in each village began planting trees on March 25th and 26th. As of March 27th, five villages including Zhangchangshen, had built 15 li of protective forests.
