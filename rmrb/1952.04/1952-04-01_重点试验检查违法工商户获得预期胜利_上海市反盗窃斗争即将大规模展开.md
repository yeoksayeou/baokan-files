Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, March 31st: Shanghai's movement against bribery, tax evasion, theft of state assets, shoddy workmanship and materials, and theft of state economic intelligence, has achieved a complete and expected victory in its first campaign. The central task of the first campaign of Shanghai's "Five-Anti" movement was: key experiments to gain experience, and to prepare conditions for the next campaign to carry out the "Five-Anti" struggle on a large scale. In this campaign, the Shanghai Municipal Production Increase and Economy Committee, in addition to mobilizing workers and shop assistants to participate in the "Five-Anti" struggle in a planned and step-by-step manner, also sent "Five-Anti" work inspection teams to inspect 74 illegal industrial and commercial households in 36 industries for key experiments. From March 21st to March 30th, about 90 percent of the inspection teams had thoroughly investigated the illegal facts of the inspected households, made conclusions, and victoriously concluded their work. Only a few households still await final review and decision.

Simultaneous with the key experimental inspection, the Municipal Production Increase and Economy Committee unified the strength of mass organizations and sent a large number of cadres to help various districts mobilize workers and shop assistants to participate in the struggle. Workers and shop assistants in many factories and stores have raised their class consciousness through accusations and reported the illegal acts of illegal capitalists. All districts have established "Five-Anti" committees and "Five-Anti" work teams according to regions or industries to cooperate with the government's inspection work.

The first campaign of key experiments has fully exposed the seriousness of the illegal activities of the illegal bourgeoisie in Shanghai. Among the 74 households inspected, the illegal income of each household ranged from several billion yuan to several tens of billions of yuan. The capitalists of the nationally "famous" Mei Lin Cannery had a total factory value of only a few billion yuan, but in the three years since the liberation of Shanghai, they have stolen more than 25 billion yuan of state assets through theft of state property and shoddy workmanship and materials.

The main characteristic of Shanghai's "Five-Anti" movement is that the preliminary investigation and research work was done well and the deployment was meticulous, hence the initial victory. This also shows that the "Five-Anti" movement is irresistible. Before the official start of the movement, many illegal capitalists had formed "alliances of offense and defense" with their accomplices or close associates, and some even adopted an attitude of "getting through" or even resisting. However, in the course of the struggle, because the staff relied on the workers and shop assistants and united the senior staff, the illegal capitalists had to confess their problems. This fact proves that any "alliance" or any conspiracy of the illegal capitalists is bound to fail.

The Shanghai Municipal Production Increase and Economy Committee is now summarizing the experience of the first campaign, and according to the policy of shortening the "Five-Anti" time, quickly forming a "Five-Anti" united front, and maintaining normal economic life, it is allocating cadres and deploying the second campaign. A new and larger-scale movement is about to unfold, and greater victories will come as expected.

### 重点试验检查违法工商户获得预期胜利  上海市反盗窃斗争即将大规模展开

    重点试验检查违法工商户获得预期胜利
    上海市反盗窃斗争即将大规模展开
    【新华社上海三十一日电】上海市反行贿、反偷税漏税、反盗窃国家资财、反偷工减料、反盗窃国家经济情报运动，第一战役已经获得了预期的完全的胜利。上海市“五反”运动第一战役的中心任务是：重点试验，取得经验，为下一战役大规模地开展“五反”斗争准备好条件。在这一战役中，上海市增产节约委员会除了有计划、有步骤地发动工人、店员参加“五反”斗争外，并派出了“五反”工作检查队检查包括三十六个行业的七十四户违法工商户，进行重点试验。从三月二十一日开始，到三十日为止，约百分之九十的检查队都已彻底清查了被检查户的违法事实，作出了结论，胜利收兵。仅有少数的户还有待最后审查定案。
    与重点试验检查同时，市增产节约委员会统一了群众团体的力量，派了大批干部帮助各区发动工人、店员参加斗争。许多厂、店的工人、店员都通过控诉提高了阶级觉悟，检举了违法资本家的违法行为。各区都按地区或行业建立了“五反”委员会和“五反”工作队，配合政府的检查工作。
    重点试验的第一个战役，就已充分暴露了上海违法资产阶级违法的严重。在被检查的七十四户中，每一户的违法所得从几十亿元到几百亿元。“闻名”全国的梅林罐头厂资本家，全部工厂的总值不过几十亿元，但在上海解放的三年中，他们竟盗窃国家资财、偷工减料二百五十多亿元。
    上海市“五反”运动的主要特点是事先调查研究工作做得好，并经过周密布置，因此初战即胜。这也说明“五反”运动是不可抗拒的。在运动正式开始以前，许多违法资本家都和他们的同谋或亲近的人物订立“攻守同盟”，也有些人采取“过关”甚至抗拒的态度。但在斗争的过程中，由于工作人员依靠了工人、店员，团结了高级职员，违法资本家们都不能不交代问题。这一事实证明违法资本家的任何“同盟”、任何阴谋伎俩都必然要失败的。
    上海市增产节约委员会现在正在总结第一战役的经验，并根据缩短“五反”时间、迅速组成“五反”统一战线及维持正常经济生活的方针，调配干部，部署第二战役。新的、更大规模的运动即将展开，更大的胜利也将一如预期地到来。
