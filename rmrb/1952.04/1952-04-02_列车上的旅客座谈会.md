    Passenger Forum on the Train
    In order to cooperate with the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" campaigns, the Taiyuan Train Section frequently holds passenger forums on trains regarding the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement. At these forums, workers, students, and government cadres among the passengers first make enlightening speeches. Passengers introduce the situation or experience of carrying out the movement in their local areas or units, as well as moving examples. Once, a comrade reported on the case of unscrupulous merchants harming the Volunteer Army, which aroused the immense indignation of the passengers. Some corrupt elements who had already confessed reported on their confession process. The forum not only improved the passengers' understanding of the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, but also encouraged the passengers' enthusiasm for exposing corrupt elements. On average, we receive more than 20 pieces of reporting material on each train. Such passenger forums on trains play a certain role in the anti-corruption and anti-bribery movement. This is a new form of train propaganda. Chen Zhiying Min Yaozu Yu Liansheng

    列车上的旅客座谈会
    太原列车段为了配合“三反”、“五反”斗争，经常在列车上举办关于反贪污、反盗窃运动的旅客座谈会。在这种座谈会上，先由旅客中的职工、学生、政府干部作启发发言。旅客们介绍当地或本单位开展运动的情况或经验，以及动人的事例。有一次一位同志报告了奸商暗害志愿军的情况，激起旅客们的无比愤恨。有些已经坦白的贪污分子报告了自己坦白的经过。座谈会不但使旅客对“三反”、“五反”运动的认识提高了一步，而且鼓舞了旅客们检举贪污分子的积极性。我们每趟车，平均都收到二十多份检举材料。这样的列车旅客座谈会，对反贪污、反盗窃运动是起一定作用的。这是列车宣传的新形式。　陈致英　闵耀祖　于连生
