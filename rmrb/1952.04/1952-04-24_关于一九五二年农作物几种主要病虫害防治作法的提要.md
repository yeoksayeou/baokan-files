Central People's Government Ministry of Agriculture

To combat crop diseases and insect pests and ensure the completion of the task of increasing yields per unit area, we have formulated several major disease and insect pest control measures based on past experience for reference by various regions.

    Locusts: Learning from the lessons of last year, we should plan and prepare to control locusts this year. In September of last year, our ministry issued "Measures for Inspecting Overwintering Locust Eggs," instructing areas that had suffered from locust plagues to conduct inspections according to these measures and make preparations for locust control. Currently, except for East China, other regions have not paid enough attention to this matter. Although some areas in Hebei Province have carried out autumn plowing to kill eggs, according to our ministry's preliminary inspection results, this has only reduced locust eggs by 30%. Therefore, in areas with eggs, we should regularly scout for locust egg hatching from the end of April to May, as well as the actual situation of the area and density of occurrence, while reporting to higher-level leading organs at any time, and organize appropriate forces to carry out prevention and control. If the situation is serious, the leading organs at all levels in these areas should immediately establish locust control headquarters, unify leadership, and closely integrate allocation, reconnaissance, surveillance, and prevention and control work, and earnestly achieve "early attack, small attack, and annihilation." In areas with dense hopper populations, medicine and machinery can be used to adopt encirclement tactics against hoppers, spraying "666" (the maximum dosage of medicine per acre is three catties) from the periphery to the center. Xinjiang is an isolated locust area, and should make its own plans and carry out prevention and control based on the medicine and machinery allocated by the central government. Areas where soil locusts, bamboo locusts, and rice locusts occur should also conduct investigations and eliminate them in a timely manner; if medicine and machinery are needed, they should be raised locally.

    Locust control work in the future will still be a continuous and long-term task. Before the problems of water conservancy and land reclamation in large areas of wasteland and lake swamp areas are completely solved, locusts will often occur or occur once every one, two, or three years. In order to eliminate locust plagues in a timely manner, it is necessary to establish sound locust control organizations in such areas, grasp the locust situation, and do a good job in a series of tasks such as investigation, planning, preparation, reconnaissance, surveillance, and prevention and control, and play an active advisory role. Therefore, major administrative regions and provinces are required to establish locust control stations at appropriate locations in locust areas. Existing plant disease and insect pest prevention and control stations should be assigned additional cadres to strengthen their forces, with locust control as their main business.

    Cotton Insects: Cotton aphids are the most serious pest in the cotton area of the Yellow River Basin. The experience of 1951 tells us: (1) Those who treated early reaped a bumper harvest. Those who treated late reduced production by 15% to 20%, and had more late-maturing cotton bolls of poor quality; at the same time, because the harvest was late, it also affected autumn plowing and moisture conservation work. Therefore, aphid control must be done early. Because cotton aphids reproduce quickly and in large numbers, it is necessary to treat them universally, continuously, and thoroughly to be effective. (2) Cotton oil soap, cotton aphid soap (that is, cotton oil sludge soap), or egg cotton oil emulsion should not be used continuously, and must be alternated with other agents such as tobacco water and rotenone powder. So as not to hinder the development of cotton seedlings. All regions should pay special attention to the above two experiences. Before sowing cotton, weeds in the fields, roadsides, field edges, and graves should be removed. Sow thistle and Prunella vulgaris are overwintering hosts of cotton aphids; when you see this kind of grass, you must dig it up by the roots and bring it back to compost, and never throw it in the field. Pomegranates and hibiscus are also the main overwintering hosts of cotton aphids; before cotton seedlings emerge, they must be carefully inspected, and aphids must be sprayed and eliminated as soon as they are discovered, so as to prevent harm to cotton seedlings. After the cotton seedlings emerge, early thinning, dense seedling retention, and late seedling setting should be implemented, and the thinned seedlings should be brought back to compost and not thrown into the field at will. In order to eliminate cotton aphids in a timely manner, a general spraying should be carried out before the wheat harvest; after the wheat harvest, all forces should be immediately concentrated on a lasting struggle against cotton aphids.

    Red spiders are also a serious pest in the cotton-producing areas of the Yellow River Basin. Leguminous crops are its main host; do not cultivate leguminous crops in or near cotton fields. Red spiders are very small in size and are not easily noticed when they first occur. By the time the cotton leaves turn red, it is too late for prevention and control, so they must be inspected early. The inspection method is: use white paper to clip the upper and lower sides of the cotton leaves in the lower part of the cotton plant, and pinch it tightly with your fingers. If red dots are found on the white paper, it means that there are red spiders, and lime sulfur mixture or flour paste water should be sprayed immediately, and inspection and prevention should be continued.

    In addition, blind bugs also have a tendency to spread gradually. In areas where blind bugs are severely harmful, 5% to 10% "DDT" powder should be sprayed in a targeted manner every 20 days from the beginning of July, for a total of three sprays. This can not only prevent the harm of blind bugs, but also prevent and control general late cotton insects, such as leaf rollers and cotton bollworms.

    In the cotton area of the Yangtze River Basin, in addition to paying attention to the prevention and control of cotton aphids and other late cotton insects, the focus should be on the prevention and control of cotton leaf rollers. When leaf rollers occur, they should be universally captured and killed, and lead arsenate liquid, or 5% to 10% "DDT" powder or 5% to 10% "DDT" sulfur powder should be sprayed in a targeted manner.

    Borers: Last year, various places universally launched mass borer control campaigns, which achieved great results. For example, the Nanchang area of Jiangxi Province vigorously implemented the three plowing movement, and picked up and destroyed rice roots, so borers rarely occurred. South Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian and other places have formulated borer control programs in a planned manner, and carried out four-season borer control, and the rate of white ears has also been greatly reduced. Experience has proved that to eliminate borer damage, it is necessary to continuously prevent and control it, not only during the peak period of borer occurrence, but also during its latent period. Therefore, to do a good job in borer control, it is necessary to promptly spring plow and irrigate, pick up and destroy rice roots, and further improve the appropriate seedbeds for catching moths, lighting lamps to attract moths, and collecting eggs. According to the climate of various places, the appropriate time should be grasped to carry out moth catching and egg killing in rice fields. In areas with the habit of inserting tobacco stalks (inserting tobacco stalks near rice roots can drive away pests), tobacco stalks can be inserted. After harvesting, autumn plowing and winter plowing should be universally carried out, and rice roots should be dug up. Special attention should be paid to digging up rice roots in rice fields planted with green manure. In rice fields in areas with convenient water sources, long-term irrigation should be carried out in winter. In short, borer control work must be implemented throughout the year.

    In areas where rice casebearer moths occur seriously, it should be advocated to use rice combs before heading (that is, scraping off the rice casebearer moths parasitic on rice like combing hair) to save manpower.

    Wheat Gall Midge: In 1951, the wheat gall midge occurred in 121 counties in seven provinces and seven administrative offices in the four major administrative regions of East China, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest. To prevent and control the wheat gall midge, spraying "666" powder is the most effective. However, before this kind of powder can be universally supplied, the method of pulling nets to capture and kill created by the masses in Nanyang Prefecture, Henan Province, can be widely promoted. This kind of net is made of thin gauze two and a half feet wide and two feet long (the paste powder is washed away), and the two ends of the cloth are sewn and nailed to wooden sticks or bamboo poles, and hemp ropes are attached to the upper and lower sides of the cloth. When using, two people pull the wooden sticks at both ends of the net back and forth in the wheat field. Pay attention when pulling: (1) The net should be soaked in water, and half of the net should be exposed above the wheat ears; (2) It should be pulled quickly, and the pace and speed of the two people should be consistent, and the rope at the bottom of the net should be tightened; (3) At least one round trip should be made in the same area; (4) The time for pulling the net to capture and kill should be when the female insects fly to the wheat ears to lay eggs the most, on sunny days from 4 pm to 9 pm, and on cloudy days from 3 pm; (5) The appropriate time for pulling the net is most effective when the wheat is in full bloom. In addition, late sowing and changing to insect-resistant wheat varieties have been effective in the Northwest, and various places can refer to and implement it.

    Miscellaneous Grain Pests and Underground Pests: Millet borer (millet stem borer), corn borer, and sorghum stem borer are serious pests in miscellaneous grain areas. There are currently no appropriate control methods for these pests. Local testing and research institutions should face the masses, combine with reality, and strive to obtain methods as soon as possible. To prevent and control millet borer, millet stubble can be universally dug and burned before the Qingming Festival to kill most of the overwintering larvae and reduce the occurrence of millet borer. In addition, during the armyworm occurrence period, it is effective to pick and burn egg leaves, use armyworm carts and armyworm pockets to capture its larvae, and spray 1% "DDT" powder in a targeted manner. When spring sowing and autumn sowing, poison grains mixed with red arsenic, white arsenic or sodium fluosilicate can be used to prevent mole crickets. In areas where wireworms occur seriously, 0.5% "666" powder should be sprayed in the furrows between wheat ridges in a targeted manner before the wheat seedlings are damaged in spring; when sowing in autumn, 6.5% "666" powder should be used to mix the seeds (5 qian 5 fen of medicine per 10 jin of seeds). In areas where scarabs are severely harmful, their habit of flying to trees in the dusk to harm them and playing dead can be used in May and June to strike the branches hard and sweep down the scarabs that fall to the ground and pretend to be dead. In addition, women and children can be mobilized to pick up grubs when cultivating the land to kill its larvae. Other pests such as cutworms and crickets can be prevented and controlled by methods such as stacking grass to lure and kill them and manual capture.

    Fruit Tree Pests: In 1952, limited by the supply of medicine and machinery, only key prevention and control can be carried out. In the north, prevent and control pear tent caterpillar, tent caterpillar, apple moth, pear looper, jujube looper, jujube fruit worm, etc.; in the south, prevent and control citrus scale insects, malignant leaf insects, citrus fruit flies, etc. Between Jingzhe (惊蛰) and Chunfen (春分), it is necessary to scrape the bark and burn these barks in time to eliminate the stellate larvae of moths hiding in the cracks in the old branches; from winter to early spring of the following year, it is necessary to vigorously pick and destroy "thimbles" (that is, tent caterpillar eggs) to eliminate tent caterpillar egg masses; before pear and apple flower buds open, spray 50% wettable "DDT" 500 times liquid once thoroughly, and spray it again after the flowers wither, which can kill the above-mentioned pests and other pests that come out to harm at the same time. The method of scraping and burning old bark can also be used to prevent and control jujube fruit worms. When jujube trees germinate, thoroughly spraying 50% wettable "DDT" 500 times liquid can kill jujube loopers and jujube fruit worms.

    To prevent and control citrus pests, the appropriate period for preventing and controlling various pests should be grasped, and lime sulfur solution and rosin mixture should be sprayed to prevent and control scale insects; lead arsenate should be used to prevent and control malignant leaf insects; the affected fruits should be universally and thoroughly picked and inspected and treated to prevent and control citrus fruit flies.

    Diseases: Wheat bunt, barley covered smut, oat covered smut, wheat nematode disease, etc. often occur seriously in various places. In the spring wheat areas of Chahar, Suiyuan, and Gansu, the highest infection rate of wheat bunt reached 80% to 90%, and the average infection rate was also 20% to 30%; in Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and northern Anhui, the highest infection rate of wheat nematode disease also reached 50% to 90%. In the prevention and control process, it has been proved that treating seeds is the most effective method to prevent and control the above-mentioned diseases. For example, in the areas of Chahar Province where "Ceresan" was used to mix seeds, the wheat infection rate was reduced to below 5%, and the average loss per mu was reduced by 15 jin. In 1952, the focus of work was on preventing and controlling wheat smut. In frequently occurring areas, the methods of mixing seeds with medicine and soaking seeds in warm soup should be universally promoted, and Chahar, Suiyuan, and Gansu provinces should be the key areas for prevention and control. Due to the insufficient supply of "Ceresan" and other medicines, the use of sulfur powder to mix seeds should be promoted to prevent and control oat covered smut. Farmers in Gansu also have considerable effects in preventing and controlling wheat bunt by soaking seeds in grass ash and preventing and controlling oat covered smut by mixing seeds with cloud mustard, which can be promoted and used. Chahar, Suiyuan, and northern Shanxi should correct the wasteful habit of mixing seeds with liquor. In areas where wheat nematode disease is serious, methods such as salt water, mud water, and clear water should be used to select seeds; in areas where wheat thresher machines for nematode disease are available, the machines should be fully utilized. Wheat stripe rust also often occurs seriously, and various places should vigorously lead the masses to universally select and change disease-resistant varieties to reduce or avoid the occurrence of this disease.

    In addition, in areas where millet downy mildew is serious, the masses should be universally mobilized to thoroughly remove gray backs and white tips. In areas where apple rot is serious, skin scraping and medicine application should also be carried out for prevention and control.

    In the Yangtze and Yellow River basins, in areas where cotton anthracnose, seedling blight, and angular leaf spot are seriously occurring, "Ceresan" and other medicines should be used for seed mixing and prevention and control. If there are insufficient medicines, the methods of soaking seeds in warm soup and scalding seeds with boiling water can be used. In Henan, Shandong, and other major tobacco areas, anthracnose of seedlings has been serious for years, and "Bordeaux" liquid should be universally sprayed for prevention and control.

    In addition, each region should determine the types of diseases and insect pests that should be prevented and controlled according to different crops. For example, the main diseases and insect pests of tea trees, mulberry trees, tung oil trees, and sugar cane should all be prevented and controlled in a targeted manner.

    ×××

    Medicines and machinery for preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests must be fully prepared and used reasonably. First of all, various places must do a good job in repairing sprayers and dusters to enhance the power of disease and insect pest prevention and control. At present, the supply of medicines and machinery is far from meeting the needs of the masses due to limited conditions. Therefore, the use of medicines and machinery must be concentrated on the prevention and control of major diseases and insect pests of crops with higher economic value, such as cotton, tobacco, fruit trees, and vegetables; the diseases and insect pests of general grain crops are still mainly controlled manually. Among the domestically produced insecticides and machinery, arsenic agents (red arsenic, white arsenic, calcium arsenate, lead arsenate) and fluorine agents (sodium fluosilicate, sodium fluoroaluminate) have very high insecticidal efficacy. Various regions should use them as soon as possible and not rely solely on the limited sources of medicines such as "DDT," "666," and "E605." "E605" is very effective, but it is also very toxic and very dangerous to people and livestock. Special attention should be paid when using it. Cotton oil soap and cotton aphid soap should be manufactured according to the specifications set by the Central Ministry of Agriculture. When preparing lime sulfur mixture, temporary medicine preparation stations can be established in various places to unify specifications and determine the dilution multiples, so that farmers can easily grasp the medicinal effect. In addition, the cultivation of insecticidal plants should be vigorously promoted in suitable areas, such as planting Derris elliptica in South China, planting native tobacco in cotton areas, and planting pyrethrum in Yunnan, Guizhou Plateau areas and Hebei and Shandong provinces in a targeted manner, which can enrich the source of insecticides in the future. Other insecticidal plants such as yam bean seeds, wild Derris elliptica, thunder god vine, bitter bark, and kiwifruit roots should also be vigorously promoted locally to supplement the shortage of medicines.

    关于一九五二年农作物几种主要病虫害防治作法的提要
    中央人民政府农业部
    为了战胜农作物的病虫灾害，保证完成单位面积增产的任务，我们根据过去经验，订出几种主要病虫害防治作法，以供各地参考。
    蝗虫：接受去年的教训，今年我们应有计划有准备地布置灭蝗。去年九月我部曾订出“过冬蝗卵检查办法”，通报曾有蝗害的地区依照这个办法检查，做好灭蝗的准备工作。目前除华东外，其他地区还没有十分重视这件事情。河北省有些地区虽已进行秋耕灭卵，但根据我部初步检查结果，也只减少蝗卵百分之三十。因此在有卵地区应于四月底至五月间经常侦察蝗卵孵化情形，以及发生的面积和密度等实际情况，一面随时报告上级领导机关，一面组织适当力量，进行防治。如情况严重，这些地区的各级领导机关就要立即成立治蝗指挥部，统一领导，把调配、侦察、监视和防治工作密切结合起来，切实做到“打早、打少、打了”。在跳蝻密集地区，可使用药械，对蝗蝻采取包围战术，由外围向中心喷撒“六六六”（每亩施药量最多三斤）。新疆是一个孤立的蝗区，应根据中央配运的药械，自行做好计划，进行防治。发生土蝗、竹蝗、稻蝗的地区，也应进行调查，及时消灭；如需药械，由地方自行筹措。
    今后的治蝗工作，还是一种持续性的长期的工作。在大片荒地和湖沼地带的水利和垦荒问题，没有得到彻底解决以前，蝗虫是会经常发生或间隔一、二年或二、三年发生一次的。为了及时的消灭蝗患，在这种地区必须建立健全的治蝗机构，掌握蝗虫情况，做好调查、规划、准备、侦察、监视、防治等一系列的工作，起积极的参谋作用。因此，要求各大行政区和省，在蝗区适当地点，建立治蝗站。已有病虫害防治站的，应增配干部，加强力量，以治蝗为主要业务。
    棉虫：棉蚜是黄河流域棉区最严重的害虫。一九五一年的经验告诉我们：（一）凡是治得早的，都获得了丰收。治得晚的，减产百分之十五至二十，并且霜后花多，品质差；同时因为收获迟，并影响到秋耕保墒工作。所以，治蚜必须治得早。因棉蚜繁殖快，数量大，所以要普遍治、连续治、彻底治，才能奏效。（二）棉油皂、棉蚜皂（即棉油泥皂），或鸡蛋棉油乳剂，不要连续使用，必须和其他药剂如烟草水、鱼藤粉等更迭使用。以免妨碍棉苗的发育。以上两条经验，各地应特别重视。棉花播种前，应清除田间、路旁、地边、坟头的杂草。苦荬菜、夏至草等是棉蚜的越冬寄主；看见这种草必须连根掘起，带回沤粪，切勿扔在田间。石榴、木槿等也是棉蚜的主要越冬寄主；在棉苗未出土之前，必须仔细检查，发现棉蚜，即须喷药消灭，以免移害棉苗。棉苗出土后，要实行早间苗、密留苗、晚定苗，把间下的幼苗带回沤粪，也不可随意扔在田间。为了及时消灭棉蚜，麦收以前必须普遍喷药一次；麦收以后应立刻集中一切力量对棉蚜作持久的斗争。
    红蜘蛛也是黄河流域产棉区的严重害虫。豆类作物是它的主要寄主；棉田及其附近不要栽培豆类作物，红蜘蛛身体很小，初发生时不易被人注意，及至棉叶发红，防治就已经过晚，所以必须及早检查。检查方法是：用白纸夹在棉株下部棉叶的上下两面，用手指紧捏一下，如白纸上发现红色小点，就是有了红蜘蛛，应即喷射石灰硫磺合剂或面糊水，并须继续检查防治。
    此外，盲椿象也有逐渐蔓延的趋势。在盲椿象为害严重的地区，应自七月上旬起，有重点地每隔二十天喷撒百分之五至十的“滴滴涕”粉一次，共喷三次。这样作不仅可以防止盲椿象的危害，并可防治一般后期棉虫，如卷叶虫、棉铃虫等。
    长江流域棉区，除应注意防治棉蚜和其他后期棉虫外，应以防治棉卷叶虫为重点。在卷叶虫发生时，应即普遍捕杀，有重点地喷撒砒酸铅液，或百分之五至十的“滴滴涕”粉或百分之五至十的“滴滴涕”硫磺粉。
    螟虫：各地去年普遍开展了群众性的治螟运动，收效很大。如江西南昌专区厉行三耕运动，拾毁稻根，螟虫就极少发生。苏南、浙江、福建等地有计划地制订治螟方案，进行四季治螟，白穗率也大大减低。经验证明，消灭螟害，不仅在螟虫盛发时期，也必须在它潜伏的时期，连续地防治。因此，要做好防治螟虫工作，必须及时春耕灌水，拾毁稻根，并进一步做好合式秧田，以便捕蛾、点灯诱蛾、采卵。应根据各地气候，掌握适当时期，进行稻田捕蛾灭卵工作。在有插烟茎习惯（在稻根附近插烟茎可驱害虫）的地区，可以进行插烟茎。收割以后，应普遍秋耕、冬耕，挖拾稻根。对种植绿肥的稻田内的稻根，更要注意挖拾。在水源便利的地区的稻田，冬季应长期灌水。总之，必须把治螟工作贯彻到全年。
    稻苞虫发生严重的地区，应提倡在孕穗前使用稻梳（即像梳发一样把寄生在水稻上的稻苞虫刮掉），以节省人力。
    小麦吸浆虫：一九五一年，小麦吸浆虫曾在华东、中南、西南、西北四个大行政区七省七行署一百二十一县发生。防治小麦吸浆虫，以喷射“六六六”药粉为最有效。但在这种药粉不能普遍供应以前，可以广泛推广河南省南阳专区群众创造的拉网捕杀的办法。这种网是用宽二尺半、长二丈的稀纱布（把浆粉洗去）制成，把布的两端缝钉在木棍或竹竿上，布的上下两边缀以麻绳。用时，由两人分扯着网两端的木棍，在麦田里来回地拉。拉时应注意：（一）网要用水浸湿，网的一半要露在麦穗上面；（二）拉得要快，两人步伐和速度要一致，网的下边绳子要拉紧；（三）在同一面积内至少要往返各一次；（四）拉网捕杀的时间，以雌虫飞到麦穗上产卵最多时为准，晴天在下午四时至九时，阴天在下午三时后，即可开始工作；（五）拉网适当时期，以在麦子开花最盛期为最有效。此外，进行晚播和换种抗虫的麦种，在西北已见效果，各地可参照实行。
    杂粮害虫及地下害虫：粟灰螟（谷子钻心虫）、玉米螟、高粱条螟是杂粮区内的严重害虫。对这些害虫，目前尚无适当防治方法，各地试验研究机构应面向群众，结合实际，力求早日获得办法。防治粟灰螟，可在清明节以前普遍进行刨烧谷茬，杀死大部分的过冬幼虫，以减少粟灰螟发生。此外，在行军虫发生时期，摘烧卵叶，用粘虫车、黏虫兜，捕捉它的幼虫，有重点地喷撒百分之一的“滴滴涕”粉剂，都很有效。在春播、秋播时，用红砒、白砒或氟矽酸钠配制毒谷，可以防治蝼蛄。金针虫发生严重的地区，在春季未害麦苗前，要有重点地在麦垅间开沟喷撒百分之零点五的“六六六”粉剂；秋季播种时要用百分之六点五的“六六六”粉剂拌种（每十斤种子用药五钱五分）。金龟子为害严重的地区，可在五、六月间利用它们在黄昏时飞集树上为害和假死的习性，猛击树枝，扫杀落地装死的金龟子。此外，可在耕地时发动妇女儿童捡拾蛴螬，以杀死它的幼虫。其他如地老虎蟋蟀等，可用堆草诱杀、人工捕杀等方法防治。
    果树害虫：一九五二年限于药械的供应，只能进行重点防治。北方防治梨星毛虫、天幕毛虫、苹果巢虫、梨尺蠖（梨步曲）、枣尺蠖（枣步曲）、枣实虫等；南方防治柑橘的介壳虫、恶性叶虫、柑蛆等。在惊蛰春分间，必须进行刮树皮，并及时烧掉这些树皮，以消灭隐藏在老枝干翘皮裂缝里过冬的星毛虫幼虫；从冬季到来年早春，必须大力摘毁“顶针”（即天幕毛虫的卵），以消灭天幕毛虫的卵块；在梨、苹果的花蕾没有开放以前，要周密地喷射百分之五十可湿性“滴滴涕”五百倍液一次，花谢后再喷射一次，可以杀死以上各种害虫和在同时期出来为害的其他害虫。对枣实虫也可采用刮烧老树皮的方法来防治。枣树发芽时，周密地喷射百分之五十的可湿性“滴滴涕”五百倍液，可以杀死枣尺蠖和枣实虫。
    防治柑橘害虫，应抓紧各种害虫防治适期，喷射石灰硫磺液、松脂合剂以防治介壳虫；用砒酸铅防治恶性叶虫；普遍而彻底地摘检与处理被害果实，以防治柑蛆。
    病害：小麦腥黑穗病、大麦坚黑穗病、燕麦坚黑穗病、小麦线虫病等在各地经常严重地发生。察哈尔、绥远、甘肃等春麦区小麦腥黑穗病最高被害率达百分之八十至九十，平均被害率也有百分之二十至三十；陕西、河南、河北、山东和皖北等地小麦线虫病最高被害率亦达百分之五十到九十。在防治过程中，已证明处理种子是防治上述病害最有效的方法。如察哈尔省使用“赛力散”拌种的地区，麦子被害率减低到百分之五以下，每亩平均减少损失十五市斤。一九五二年以防治麦类黑穗病为工作重点，在经常发生的地区，要普遍推行药剂拌种和温汤浸种等方法，并以察哈尔、绥远、甘肃三省为防治重点区。由于“赛力散”等药剂的供应量不足，防治燕麦坚黑穗病应提倡使用硫磺粉拌种。甘肃农民用蓬灰浸拌种防治小麦腥黑穗病，和云芥拌种防治燕麦坚黑穗病，也有相当效果，可以推广使用。察哈尔、绥远和晋北应纠正用烧酒拌种的浪费习惯。小麦线虫病严重的地区，要使用盐水、泥水和清水等选种方法；已有线虫病麦汰除机的地区，更要充分利用机器。小麦黄锈病也经常严重地发生，各地应大力领导群众普遍进行选换抗病品种，以减轻或避免这种病害发生。
    此外，粟（谷子）白发病严重的地区，要普遍发动群众彻底拔除灰背和白尖。苹果腐烂病严重地区，也应进行刮皮涂药防治。
    长江和黄河流域，棉花炭疽病、立枯病和角斑病等严重发生的地区，要用“赛力散”等药剂进行拌种防治。如药剂不足，可使用温汤浸种和开水烫种方法。河南、山东等主要烟区，苗床炭疽病历年来都很严重，要普遍喷撒“波尔多”液进行防治。
    此外，各地区应根据不同作物，决定应防治病虫害的种类。如茶树、桑树、油桐、甘蔗等的主要病虫，均应有重点地进行防治。
    ×××
    防治病虫的药械，必须充分地准备，合理地使用。首先，各地必须做好整修喷雾器、喷粉器的工作，以增强防治病虫的力量。目前药械的供应，因限于条件，远不能满足群众的需要。所以，药械的使用，必须集中在防治经济价值较高的作物，如棉花、烟草、果树、蔬菜等的主要病虫害；一般粮食作物的病虫害，仍以人工防治为主。国产杀虫药械中的砒素剂（红砒、白砒、砒酸钙、砒酸铅）与氟素剂（氟矽酸钠、氟铝酸钠），杀虫效力很高，各地区应尽先使用，不要单纯依靠来源不多的药剂如“滴滴涕”“六六六”
    “E六○五”等。“E六○五”药效甚强，但毒力也大，对人、畜非常危险，使用时要特别注意。棉油皂和棉蚜皂应按照中央农业部所订规格制造。配制石灰硫磺合剂时，各地可成立临时的配药站，统一规格，确定稀释倍数，使农民容易掌握药效。此外，在适宜地区应大力提倡种植杀虫植物，如华南种植鱼藤，棉区种植土烟，云南、贵州高原地带及河北、山东两省，有重点地种植除虫菊等，可以充裕今后杀虫药剂的来源。他如豆薯子、野生鱼藤、雷公藤、苦树皮、羊桃根等杀虫植物，也应就地大力推广，以补药剂的不足。
