The Department of Chemistry at Beijing Normal University Takes on a New Look After the "Three-Anti" Campaign; All Faculty Members Write a Letter to Chairman Mao, Guaranteeing to be Good Teachers of the People

[Our Newspaper's News] All the faculty members of the Chemistry Department of Beijing Normal University wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting on their great ideological transformation during the "Three-Anti" campaign. They promised to continue to work hard to transform themselves and become people's teachers in name and in fact. The original letter is as follows:

Respected Chairman Mao:

	We would like to report to you with unparalleled excitement and gratitude on our gains in the "Three-Anti" movement. Before the "Three-Anti" movement, our department was filled with a depressing atmosphere. Many comrades worked only for food and fame, caring about themselves rather than the motherland and the people. Political study was neglected and considered irrelevant to teaching. When studying, there was no preparation before the meeting, and during the meeting, either there was a lack of energy and unwillingness to speak, or there were complaints and temper tantrums. People were full of prejudice, harmonious when nothing happened, and attacking each other when something did; giving no opinions to people's faces, and making indiscriminate accusations behind their backs. Some were arrogant, and some were slick and worldly. In teaching, the so-called material civilization of American imperialism was worshipped, and the idea of getting rich and enjoying oneself was promoted. In this situation, the students felt disappointed and distressed. Some became depressed, some wanted to transfer to other schools, and some wanted to become "experts," despising the work of people's teachers. In the past three years, the motherland has been leaping forward, but our department has stagnated.

	After the start of the "Three-Anti" movement, under your leadership and the leadership of the Party, we threw ourselves into this ideological transformation struggle. The old was eliminated, and the new was budding. Now a new atmosphere has emerged in the department. Everyone realizes the importance of responsibility and the glory of work, urgently demanding to improve their political understanding and determined to serve the people well. Many moving events have occurred in this struggle. A female comrade who was formerly bound by feudal consciousness and felt inferior and worthless is now filled with the joy of new life because she feels liberated; a comrade who was always depressed and buried himself in books was stimulated to serve the people with enthusiasm because he participated in land reform work, approached the masses, and recognized the class struggle; comrades who were previously arrogant now feel gratified to be a member of the masses; a comrade who hoped to become an "expert" and was not at ease in this position strengthened his determination to serve the people's normal education because he was inspired by you; a comrade who craved wealth and enjoyment saw a bright future after criticizing his personal dirty thoughts; a comrade who was hindered from making progress by old moral ideas now sees the shame of being backward.

	In the "Three-Anti" summary meeting of teachers and students, we were saddened by the mistakes of the past and delighted by the harvest of the present. But we all have the same belief that only under your leadership and the leadership of the Party can we have today's new life. We would like to make our solemn guarantee before our beloved leader. We are determined to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought hard, continue to transform ourselves, and strive to be a people's teacher in name and in fact. Under your glorious illumination, we shoulder the heavy responsibility entrusted to us by the motherland, and with full confidence, we advance, advance, and advance forever.

We respectfully wish you good health.

    北京师范大学化学系经过“三反”运动后气象一新
    全体教员写信给毛主席保证作好人民教师
    【本报讯】北京师范大学化学系全体教员，写信给毛主席，报告他们在“三反”运动中在思想改造方面的巨大收获。他们保证今后继续努力改造自己，做名符其实的人民教师。原信如下：敬爱的毛主席：
    我们谨以无比兴奋而感激的心情，向您报告我们在“三反”运动中的收获。“三反”运动前，我们系中充满了令人沮丧的气氛，很多同志只是为了吃饭和为了名位而工作，他们关心的是个人而不是祖国和人民。政治学习受到了轻视，被认为和教学无关，学习时，会前不准备，会上不是无精打彩不愿发言，就是发牢骚闹意气。人和人间充满了偏见，无事一团和气，有事互相打击；当面不提意见，背后胡乱指责。有的自高自大，有的八面玲珑。在教学中美帝国主义的所谓物质文明被崇拜着，发财享受的思想被宣扬着。在这情况下，同学们感到了失望痛心，有的变消沉，有的要转学，也有的想作“专家”，轻视人民教师的工作。三年来祖国在飞跃地前进着，但我们的系却停滞不前。“三反”运动开始后，在您和党的领导下，我们投身在这一思想改造的斗争中，旧的被铲除，新的在萌芽，如今系中已出现了一片新气象。每个人都认识到责任的重大，工作的光荣，迫切地要求提高政治认识，决心好好地为人民服务。在这次斗争中出现了许多动人的事例，过去受了封建意识束缚而自卑自贱的一个女同志，如今因感到自己被解放，充满了新生的喜悦；一个素来消沉，终日埋首书堆的同志，因参加土地改革工作，靠近了群众，认识了阶级斗争，而激发出为人民服务的热情；以往自高自大的同志，如今却以能成为群众中的一员而感到欣慰；一个企望作“专家”，不安心这一岗位工作的同志，因受到您的感召，坚定了为人民师范教育服务的决心；一个渴求发财享受的同志，在批判了个人的污浊思想后，看到了光明的前程；一个被旧道德思想阻碍着不能进步的同志，如今也看清了落后的可耻。在“三反”总结师生大会中，我们为过去的错误而痛心，为现在的丰收而喜悦。但我们都有同一的信念，只有在您和党的领导下，我们才有今日的新生。我们愿在敬爱的领袖前，提出我们庄严的保证，我们决心要努力学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，继续改造自己，争取作个名符其实的人民教师。在您的光辉照耀下，我们肩担着祖国交给我们的重任，满怀着信心，前进、前进、永远前进。敬祝您身体健康
