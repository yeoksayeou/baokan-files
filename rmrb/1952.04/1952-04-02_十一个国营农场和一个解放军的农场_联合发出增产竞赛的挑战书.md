Eleven state-owned farms and one People's Liberation Army (PLA) farm, including six mechanized farms and six ordinary farms, jointly issued a challenge letter with the approval of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. This was to fulfill the state's assignment of building state-owned agriculture, developing agricultural production, and increasing per-unit-area yield to ensure this year's production increase target. They are calling on state-owned farms and PLA-run farms nationwide to accept the challenge and compete with them in fulfilling the 1952 task and increasing per-unit-area yield. In terms of increasing per-unit-area yield, they also welcome agricultural mutual aid and cooperation organizations and farmers nationwide to participate in the competition. The eleven state-owned farms and one PLA farm jointly issuing the challenge are: Shuangqiao Practice Farm of the Mechanized Farming School directly under the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, Wulidian State-Owned Farm directly under the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, Northeast Region No. 93 Mechanical Farm, Henan Province Huangfanqu Mechanized Farm, Shandong Province Guangbei Mechanized Farm, Xinjiang Military Region August 1st Farm of the People's Liberation Army, Hebei Province Agricultural Experiment Station, Shanxi Province Yuncheng Special District Farm, Shanxi Province Yangqu County Farm, Shandong Province Laiwu County Farm, Hunan Province Changde Rice Farm, and Northwest Region Jinghui Farm. Below is the challenge letter they issued.

“We are initiating this competition primarily to participate in the patriotic production increase movement in agriculture in 1952, and to strive with farmers nationwide to increase the per-unit-area yield of various crops. We should play a leading and exemplary role in increasing per-unit-area yield. We call on farms nationwide to participate in the competition on the per-unit-area yield of one or more crops, and welcome national labor models, agricultural mutual aid and cooperation organizations, and farmers to accept the challenge. We guarantee to fulfill the following conditions:

I. Increase per-unit-area yield and fulfill this year's production increase target. The per-mu yield of all crops sown on the farm this year, except those used for experimentation, must exceed last year's yield and be 20% higher than the average yield of the same crop in the local area.

II. Each farm must create a high yield of one or more major crops (at least ten mu or more) this year.

III. Each farm must complete and strive to exceed its annual production increase plan, various experimental and research work plans, various construction (including breeding superior varieties) plans, and various promotion plans (except those without experimental and promotion tasks).

IV. Each farm must establish close ties with local farmers and become the core, leader, and promoter of local experimentation and promotion of superior varieties, research and promotion of cultivation techniques.

V. Each farm must become a leader and promoter in the local fight against various natural disasters. If local areas experience disasters such as floods, droughts, diseases, and pests this year, the farm must have good results in drought prevention, flood control, and pest and disease control, and have good results in promoting drought prevention, flood control, and pest and disease control among local farmers.

    十一个国营农场和一个解放军的农场
    联合发出增产竞赛的挑战书
    十一个国营农场和一个人民解放军的农场，包括六个机耕农场和六个普通农场，为了完成国家所给予的建设国营农业、发展农业生产，并为了提高单位面积产量，保证今年的增产任务，经中央人民政府农业部批准，联合发出了挑战书，要求全国的国营农场和人民解放军经营的农场应战，在完成一九五二年任务和提高单位面积产量上和它们竞赛。在提高单位面积产量方面，它们并欢迎全国的农业互助合作组织和农民参加竞赛。联名挑战的十一个国营农场和一个人民解放军农场是：中央人民政府农业部直属机耕学校双桥实习农场、中央人民政府农业部直属国营五里店农场、东北区九三机械农场、河南省黄泛区机耕农场、山东省广北机耕农场、人民解放军新疆军区八一农场、河北省农业试验场、山西省运城专区农场、山西省阳曲县农场、山东省莱芜县农场、湖南省常德稻场、西北区泾惠农场。下面就是它们发出的挑战书。
    “我们发起竞赛，主要为了参加一九五二年农业方面的爱国增产运动，和全国农民一起，为提高各种农作物的单位面积产量而奋斗。我们应该在提高单位面积上起带头和示范作用。我们要求全国农场参加竞赛，在一种或几种农作物的单位面积产量上，并欢迎全国劳动模范、农业互助合作组织和农民应战竞赛。我们保证完成以下的几个条件：
    一、提高单位面积产量，完成今年的增产任务。农场今年所播种的一切作物，除进行试验者以外，每亩产量都必须超过去年，并比当地该种作物的平均产量高百分之二十。
    二、每个农场今年必须创造一种或几种主要作物（至少十亩以上）的高产量。
    三、每个农场必须完成并争取超过它今年的增产计划，各项试验、研究工作计划，各项建设（包括繁殖良种）计划和各项推广计划（没有试验、推广等任务者除外）。
    四、每个农场必须与当地农民建立密切联系，成为当地试验和推广优良品种，研究和推广耕作技术的核心、领导者和推动者。
    五、每个农场必须成为当地与各种自然灾害作斗争的带头者和推动者。今年当地如发生水旱病虫等灾害，农场必须在防旱、防涝、防治病虫方面有良好的成绩，并在推动当地农民防旱、防涝、防治病虫上有良好的成绩。
