Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, April 27th: On April 25th, our side announced the conclusion of the administrative meeting of the Item 4 agenda secretariat meeting, and the entry into open negotiations, making it impossible for the other side to continue deceiving and fooling the people of the world by using the form of administrative meetings. However, the other side openly adopted the means of delaying the meeting, and proposed an indefinite adjournment of the Item 4 agenda secretariat meeting. On the afternoon of the 25th, the other side suggested holding a meeting of both sides' delegations on the 27th. Our side, adhering to the consistent position of striving to achieve an armistice in Korea as soon as possible in all meetings, agreed to the other side's suggestion to hold a delegation conference on the 26th. However, the other side temporarily notified a postponement of the delegation conference on the 27th. At the Item 3 agenda secretariat meeting on the 27th, our side once again pointed out that if the other side continues to adopt a delaying and unwilling attitude to solve problems on all agenda items in the negotiations, the armistice negotiations will not be able to make any progress.

    美方续采取拖延谈判的态度竟通知延期召开代表团大会
    【新华社开城二十七日电】四月二十五日，我方宣布第四项议程参谋会议结束行政性会议，进入公开谈判，使对方无法利用行政性会议的形式，继续蒙蔽欺骗世界人民。但对方公然采取了拖延会议的手段，提议第四项议程参谋会议无限期休会。二十五日下午对方建议在二十七日召开双方代表团大会。我方本着在一切会议中，努力争取早日实现朝鲜停战的一贯立场，在二十六日同意了对方召开代表团大会的建议。但对方却又在二十七日临时通知延期召开代表团大会。我方在二十七日第三项议程参谋会议上，再次指出，如果对方在谈判中的各项议程上继续采取拖延而不愿解决问题的态度，停战谈判将不可能有任何进展。
