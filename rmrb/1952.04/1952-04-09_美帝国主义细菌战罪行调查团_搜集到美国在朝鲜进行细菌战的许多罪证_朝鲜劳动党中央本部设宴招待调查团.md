Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 8th. The "Investigation Team on Crimes of Bacteriological Warfare by US Imperialism" is conducting intensive investigation and research work in the front and rear areas of Korea.

    Since arriving at the Korean front on March 20, the investigation team has received strong assistance from commanders, fighters, medical staff, and anti-American and aid-Korea volunteer epidemic prevention and inspection team personnel of the Chinese People's Volunteers, and has collected a large amount of materials and evidence (including confessions from captured US military prisoners and captured airborne special agents) of US imperialism's bacteriological warfare. In terms of material evidence alone, more than 900 pieces of poisoned insects, toxins, and bacterial bomb casings scattered by the American invaders have been collected. This material evidence irrefutably proves that the American invaders have conducted large-scale bacteriological warfare on the Korean battlefield.

    At 10:00 AM on the 7th, under the auspices of the Korean Ministry of Health, all members of the investigation team and eyewitnesses and witnesses to the crimes of bacteriological warfare by US imperialism in Pyongyang held a forum.
