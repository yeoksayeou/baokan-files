The Bi Yongcheng Big Theft Group That Sabotaged Cooperative Enterprises
By our reporter Shen Shi

The Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency recently uncovered the Bi Yongcheng big theft group case. This theft group seriously and systematically sabotaged agricultural production, price policies, and foreign trade policies.

The Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency officially started its business in June last year. In less than a year, the leadership of all important business departments of the agency were usurped by illegal bourgeois elements. Bi Yongcheng, the organizer and leader of the big theft group, after sneaking into the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency, seized the important position of Chief of the Business Section of the Promotion Office (the Promotion Office did not have a full-time director, and the crime of Bi actually took charge of the entire office's work). He pretended to be active on weekdays, gained the trust of his superiors, and then used methods such as direct introductions or examinations to install his cronies in various departments and occupy key positions. At the same time, he colluded with private merchants, sent in "spies," or simply brought in the entire team of private merchants (the entire staff of twelve people from Tian Tai Sugar Firm, from the boss to the shop assistants, were brought into the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency to manage transactions of sugar, beans, flour, etc.). In this way, the Bi Yongcheng big theft group formed its camp for attacking the cooperative cause in the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency. Bi Yongcheng also used Guangzhou's Mao Yuan Salt and Grocery Store, You Rong Store, An Yi Pig Pen (i.e., pig market), Qi Tai Fir Wood Yard, Shenzhen's Xinhua Firm, and Hong Kong's He Yuan Firm as the outer bases for attacking the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency; and more than a hundred unscrupulous merchants, such as Guangzhou's Kun He Rosin Firm, He Li Fir Yard, Yu Fa Firewood Yard, Yongcheng Transportation Firm, and Southwest Match Factory, as the outer encirclement to attack the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency from inside and outside. In front of Mao Yuan Salt and Grocery Store, You Rong Store, An Yi Pig Pen, and other stores, signs of "Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency Promotion Office" or "Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency Consignment Office" were hung. An unscrupulous merchant from You Rong Store once said, "You Rong Store is the processing section of the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency." He Yuan Firm in Hong Kong openly appeared as the "Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency Export Consignment Store." The outposts of this theft group extended to the grassroots cooperatives in Panyu, Baoan, Lian County, Zhongshan, and other counties. They also colluded with some purchasing personnel sent to Guangzhou by the Central South, Yunnan, Hunan, Shanghai, Ganzhou, Qingdao, and other cooperative general agencies to engage in malfeasance.

After the Bi Yongcheng big theft group manipulated the major powers of promotion and purchase of the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency, and mastered the important purchase and promotion strongholds, they colluded with private merchants to steal a large amount of state property and carry out various destructive activities. Let's first look at the crimes of these thieves in destroying the prestige of cooperatives among farmers, sabotaging agricultural production, and打击 (dǎ jī, crackdown or attack) farmers!

Machong, Nanzhou, and other villages in Dongguan County are areas rich in bananas. In August last year, Bi Yongcheng sent Feng Ping to Machong to purchase bananas. Feng Ping used to be the boss of Song Xing Ban Zhuang, a fruit merchant in Guangzhou. As soon as Feng Ping arrived in Machong village, he arbitrarily convened a meeting of farmers and announced that "prices cannot be lowered casually without my notification," and "bananas cannot be sold without a note written by me." Because Feng Ping raised the price of bananas too high, the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency lost money on most of the bananas transported north each time. And because the price was too high, promotion became difficult, and it was no longer possible to purchase large quantities from cooperative members in a timely manner. At this time, under the instructions of Bi Yongcheng, Feng Ping only purchased bananas from landlords and rich peasants, not from poor and farm laborers, only from non-cooperative members, not from cooperative members. When he went to Nanzhou, where there were no cooperative organizations, to purchase bananas, he wrote to the Machong Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative, criticizing that "the bananas of poor and farm laborers in Machong Township are not up to standard and not heavy enough." What was the truth? In order to comply with the instructions of the higher-level agency, the staff of the Machong Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative selected the banana specifications very well. Even bananas that they considered not up to standard, private merchants were willing to buy at the same price. Because the banana specifications were raised too high and the scales were too large, local farmers openly criticized the township supply and marketing cooperative. In December last year, it was the time when bananas were most unsalable in Machong Township. The Machong Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative asked the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency to purchase them. At this time, Bi Yongcheng instructed Feng Ping to cancel the specifications of the top-grade bananas, forcing farmers to sell the top-grade bananas as medium-grade bananas, and lowered the market price of bananas from 80,000 yuan per picul to 30,000 yuan per picul. When the Central South District Cooperative General Agency purchased bananas, Bi Yongcheng instructed Feng Ping to sell medium-grade bananas as top-grade bananas to the Central South District Cooperative General Agency, and falsely claimed that "there are no bananas in Machong," and did not purchase bananas for the Central South District Cooperative General Agency, watching the bananas of the farmers in Machong Township rot in the fields. In order to make his illegal acts in purchasing bananas in Machong and Nanzhou "legal," Feng Ping shamelessly instructed the local landlords and rich peasants' henchmen to present him with a banner when he left Machong Township, praising him for "benefiting the farmers." However, the farmers in Machong Township hated him to the bone. The losses suffered by farmers due to price reductions and banana spoilage amounted to 580 million yuan. After the Bi Yongcheng theft group squeezed the farmers' bananas at low prices and in other ways, on the one hand, Feng Ping colluded with three private merchants in Panyu County to transport the bananas to Shanghai for sale, and on the other hand, Bi sent his confidant Liu Mengming to Beijing to promote sales. Liu committed corruption of more than 200 million yuan during his stay in Beijing.

Last winter, farmers in various counties of the Dongjiang Special District of Guangdong Province urgently needed wheat seeds for winter plowing and requested the government to supply them. The cooperative general agencies of various counties entrusted the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency to purchase more than 169,000 catties of wheat seeds. Bi Yongcheng sent Li Liangtao from the native products section (a "spy" sent by Tian Tai Firm) and Liang Xiachao and Li Ping from the supply office to handle it. Bi told Li Liangtao, "As long as the wheat grains are large and can sprout, it's fine," and instructed Li to take back the kickbacks and share them between the two. The wheat seeds bought back by Li Liangtao were not suitable for the Guangdong climate and did not sprout when planted in the ground. Farmers painfully plowed away 90% of the winter wheat, which seriously hindered spring plowing. It is estimated that farmers suffered losses of more than 1.3 billion yuan from this alone.

Pickled mustard tuber is a specialty of Xinhui County, harvested every year in March and April, salted in May, and put on the market in June. In June last year, the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency, under the responsibility of Bi Yongcheng, signed a so-called contract to sell 200,000 catties of pickled mustard tuber with Mao Yuan Firm, stipulating a price of 75,000 yuan per 100 catties, with a period of two months, and the goods were to be picked up completely by the end of July. When the contract expired, Mao Yuan Firm only picked up more than 57,000 catties of pickled mustard tuber. After August, the average price of pickled mustard tuber rose to 189,000 yuan per picul, but Mao Yuan Firm continued to pick up goods from farmers at the original price. The farmers demanded a price supplement. Not only did Bi Yongcheng not allow it, but he also issued Mao Yuan Firm with a long-term certificate of delivery, allowing Mao Yuan Firm to freely pick up and pay for goods, monopolize the market, and manipulate prices. Farmers in Xinhui suffered huge losses, while Mao Yuan Firm stole more than 150 million yuan of state assets.

The Bi Yongcheng theft group used cooperative funds, colluded with unscrupulous merchants, monopolized materials, undermined price policies, undermined foreign trade policies, and conspired to defeat state-owned trade. In September last year, Bi Yongcheng used 3.8 billion yuan of cooperative funds to purchase black olives from members of the Zengcheng County Cooperative. The Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency's black olive purchase plan was fabricated by Mao Yuan Firm. Bi Yongcheng sent his confidant Yun Xiangying to Zengcheng to purchase, and Mao Yuan Firm sent people to the grassroots cooperatives to supervise the implementation. The black olives were transported to Guangzhou and all handed over to Mao Yuan Firm for processing into oiled olives. Oiled olives were not suitable for rural needs, but only for export. The purchase price of black olives was 150,000 yuan per picul, and after being handed over to Mao Yuan Firm for processing, they were immediately sold to the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency for 250,000 yuan per picul. Bi then handed the oiled olives over to Mao Yuan Firm for export. The export application was handled by the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency, the export deposit was paid by the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency, and all profits, except for a small amount of processing material costs, went to Mao Yuan Firm. The purchase, specifications, quantity, warehousing, and sales were all controlled by Mao Yuan Firm and Bi Yongcheng, and the provincial cooperative agency only received a 6% handling fee. As a result, the 3.8 billion yuan investment only recovered 800 million yuan after half a year, and the remaining 3 billion yuan was stolen by Bi and Mao Yuan Firm. Bi Yongcheng once openly said, "We must monopolize 80% of the black olives in Zengcheng and defeat the Provincial Native Products Company."

Last year, when the Central South District Cooperative General Agency entrusted the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency to purchase bananas, Bi Yongcheng "resolved to fight down the Central South District Cooperative General Agency." In the task of purchasing kerosene, sugar, and other items for the Central South District Cooperative General Agency, the Bi Yongcheng theft group deliberately exceeded the capacity of the oil drums when loading oil, causing the oil drums to burst. In one transaction last year, as much as 8,000 catties of oil leaked. Top-grade rosin is not allowed to be exported, but the Bi Yongcheng theft group sold top-grade rosin to Kun He Firm, changed the top-grade to first-grade on the invoice, covered up the export, and undermined foreign trade policy.

The Bi Yongcheng theft group openly sold commercial information and state plans. For example, after the big thief He Zhanyuan seized the position of section chief of the industrial products section, he sold all the plans, funds, and prices of the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency and the Central South District Cooperative General Agency's purchase of kerosene and gasoline to Shenzhen Xinhua Firm. In the transaction of purchasing 5 billion yuan of kerosene last year, he prepaid the firm 1.7 billion yuan for the goods within half a year, allowing Xinhua Firm to speculate. He also condoned Xinhua Firm's smuggling and tax evasion, and adulterated water and impurities in the kerosene. Within half a year, Xinhua Firm made exorbitant profits of more than 3 billion yuan, and the state lost 1.7 billion yuan. The big thief Huang Shi was a shareholder of Yu Fa Firewood Yard. After he entered the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency, he reported all the firewood and charcoal information to Yu Fa Firewood Yard and colluded with nearly a hundred firewood and charcoal firms in Guangzhou to conduct paper transactions. The big thief Huang Jiacheng was responsible for purchasing general merchandise. He announced the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency's plan to purchase rubber shoes in the fourth quarter of 1951 to Jihua Rubber Factory, causing the factory to raise the price of rubber shoes and disrupt the market. This theft group also systematically stole and accumulated state funds, causing serious losses to the country. In August last year, the big thief Zhou Yuliang handled fir wood from Beijiang. He colluded with Zhang Zhengfang, director of the Lian County Cooperative General Agency, and purchased fir wood eight times. When fir wood was selling well, he sold the goods directly to the private merchant Qi Tai Fir Wood Yard without delivering the goods to the provincial cooperative agency. Through these fir wood transactions, they made exorbitant profits of 4 billion yuan. In the summer of last year, Bi Yongcheng and Wu Zhuozhang purchased 1.2 billion yuan worth of dried lychees. When dried lychees were selling well, they deliberately suppressed them and did not sell them, waiting until the off-season to sell them. To this day, there are still 1 billion yuan worth of dried lychees accumulated in the warehouse, rotting and infested with insects. The big thieves Hu Xinghuan and Xian Bo handled the purchase of various sugars, four times in total, with a total value of 11 billion yuan. They colluded with sugar merchants in Shanghai to sell white sugar to sugar merchants in Shanghai at low prices, or adulterated mud and sand in the sugar. In these sugar transactions, the state lost tens of billions of yuan. They purchased yellow tobacco at high prices, totaling 3.3 billion yuan, all of which did not meet the specifications; they purchased jute, totaling 1.8 billion yuan, 70% of which did not meet the specifications. These materials could not be sold for a long time.

In less than a year, the Bi Yongcheng big theft group used various methods to squeeze the state's property and the exorbitant profits obtained are estimated to be more than 10 billion yuan. The crime of Bi alone embezzled 2.1 billion yuan, and the state's direct and indirect losses are still impossible to count for the time being. They usurped the important business departments of the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency, used their "legal" status to cover up smuggling, tax evasion, and exports. They made the Guangdong Provincial Cooperative General Agency degenerate, causing the victimized farmers to complain about the cooperative, while the capitalists rejoiced on the sidelines. In less than a year, the main members of this theft group became big millionaires, and Bi Yongcheng became a shareholder in six big trading houses. However, their "good times" did not last long. In the anti-corruption and anti-theft struggle, their truth was all exposed, and their conspiracies were all revealed. The most heinous elements of this gang of criminals have been arrested.

    破坏合作事业的毕永成大盗窃集团
    本报记者  沈石
    广东省合作总社最近破获了毕永成大盗窃集团案件。这一盗窃集团曾严重地有计划地破坏农业生产、物价政策和对外贸易政策。
    广东省合作总社在去年六月正式开展业务。不到一年，全社重要业务部门的领导权都被不法资产阶级分子篡夺了。大盗窃集团的组织者和领导者毕永成自混入广东省合作总社以后，就窃夺了推销处业务科科长的要职（推销处没有专任处长，毕犯实际负责全处的工作）。他平日假装积极，骗取了上级的信任，接着就用直接介绍或招考等方式，把他的亲信安插在各部门，盘踞要津。同时又和私商串通，派进“坐探”，或干脆把私商全班人马弄进来（天泰糖行从老板到伙计共十二人都被弄到广东省合作总社，专管糖、豆、面粉等项交易）。这样便构成了毕永成大盗窃集团在广东省合作总社向合作事业进攻的阵营。毕永成又以广州市茂源咸杂货行、友荣行、安益猪栏（即猪行）、启泰杉木栏、深圳的新华行、香港的合源行等商行，作为进攻广东省合作总社的外线基地；以广州市的昆和松香行、合利杉栏、裕发柴栏、永成运输行、西南火柴厂等百余家奸商为外线的包围圈，里应外合地向广东省合作总社进攻。茂源咸杂货行、友荣行、安益猪栏等的门前，都挂上了“广东省合作总社推销处”或“广东省合作总社代销处”的招牌。友荣行的奸商曾说：“友荣行是广东省合作总社的加工科。”合源行在香港则公开以“广东省合作总社出口代销店”的面貌出现。这一盗窃集团的前哨，伸展到了番禺、宝安、连县、中山等县的基层合作社。他们还勾结中南、云南、湖南、上海、赣州、青岛等合作总社派赴广州的某些采购人员，共同营私舞弊。
    毕永成大盗窃集团操纵了广东省合作总社的推销、收购等项大权，又掌握了重要的收购、推销据点之后，就和私商串通合作，大量盗窃国家财产和进行各种破坏勾当。让我们先看一下这伙盗贼们破坏合作社在农民中的威信，破坏农业生产，打击农民的罪行吧！
    东莞县麻涌、南洲等乡是盛产香蕉的地区。去年八月，毕永成派冯平到麻涌收购香蕉。冯平过去是广州水果商行松兴办庄的老板。冯平一到麻涌乡，就擅自召开农民会议，宣布“非经本人通知，不能随便压价”，“没有本人写的条子，不能出售香蕉”。由于冯平把香蕉价格提得过高，致广东省合作总社每次北运的香蕉，大多亏本。且因价格过高，推销发生困难，便不能再及时向社员大量收购。这时，冯平又在毕永成的指使下，只收地主富农的香蕉，不收贫农雇农的香蕉，只收非社员的香蕉，不收社员的香蕉。他到没有合作社组织的南洲收购香蕉，又写信给麻涌乡供销合作社，批评“麻涌乡贫农、雇农的香蕉不合规格，不够秤头”。事实如何呢？麻涌乡供销社人员为了服从上级社的指示，把香蕉的规格选择得很好，甚至他们认为不合规格的香蕉，私商也愿出同等价钱收购。因为香蕉规格提得过高，秤太大，当地农民曾对乡供销社公开提出批评。去年十二月，是麻涌乡香蕉最滞销的时候。麻涌乡供销社向广东省合作总社要求收购。这时，毕永成便指使冯平取消上等香蕉的规格，逼着农民把上等香蕉当中等香蕉出卖，并把香蕉市价由八万元一担压低到三万元一担。当中南区合作总社收购香蕉时，毕永成又指使冯平以中等香蕉当上等香蕉卖给中南区合作总社，并诡称“麻涌没有香蕉”，不替中南区合作总社收购香蕉，坐视麻涌乡农民的香蕉在地里熟烂。冯平为了使他在麻涌、南洲收购香蕉中的违法行为“合法”，曾无耻地指使当地地主、富农的爪牙在他离开麻涌乡时向他献旗，歌颂他“造福农民”。然而，麻涌乡的农民却恨他入骨。农民因压价及香蕉腐烂所受的损失，达五亿八千多万元。毕永成盗窃集团以低价等方式榨取了农民的香蕉后，一面由冯平勾结番禺县三家私商，把香蕉运到上海出售，一面毕犯派他的心腹刘孟明驻北京推销。刘犯在北京期间贪污达二亿元以上。
    去年冬季，广东东江专区各县农民因冬耕迫切，缺乏麦种，纷纷要求政府供应。各县合作总社委托广东省合作总社代购麦种十六万九千多斤。毕永成派土产科的李良滔（是天泰行派进来的“坐探”）及供应处梁夏超、李平办理。毕犯吩咐李良滔说：“只要麦粒大，能出芽就行。”并嘱李拿回回扣两人分。李良滔买回的麦种不适合广东气候，种到地里不出苗。农民忍痛把百分之九十的冬麦犁去，又严重地妨害了春耕。光这一项，估计农民所受损失在十三亿元以上。
    冲菜是新会县的特产，每年三、四月收割，五月盐腌，六月上市。去年六月，广东省合作总社由毕永成负责和茂源行签订所谓推销冲菜二十万斤的合同，规定每百斤价七万五千元，两个月为期，到七月底把货全部提完。合同期满时，茂源行只提冲菜五万七千多斤。到八月以后，冲菜平均每担上涨到十八万九千元，但茂源行继续以原订价向农民提货。农民要求补价。毕永成不但不许，反发给茂源行长期使用的提货证明书，任令茂源行自由提货付款，垄断市场，操纵物价。新会农民遭受巨大损失，茂源行却因此盗窃国家资财一亿五千多万元。
    毕永成盗窃集团利用合作社资金，串通奸商，垄断物资，破坏物价政策，破坏对外贸易政策，并阴谋打垮国营贸易。去年九月，毕永成用合作社的资金三十八亿元，收购增城县合作社社员的乌榄。广东省合作总社收购乌榄计划是由茂源行编造的。毕永成派他的亲信云翔英到增城收购，茂源行派人到基层社监督执行。乌榄运到广州，全部交茂源行加工制成油榄。油榄不适合农村需要，只适合出口。乌榄每担收购价是十五万元，交给茂源行加工后，一转手即以二十五万元一担卖给广东省合作总社。毕犯再把油榄交给茂源行出口。出口申请由广东省合作总社办理，出口押金由广东省合作总社交付，除了少数加工原料费，一切利润全归茂源行。而进货、规格、数量、仓存、卖货全由茂源行和毕永成掌握，省合作总社仅得百分之六的手续费。结果三十八亿元的投资，历时半年，仅回笼八亿元，其余三十亿元，则被毕犯和茂源行盗窃去了。毕永成曾公开地说：“要把增城百分之八十的乌榄垄断过来，打垮省土产公司。”
    去年，中南区合作总社委托广东省合作总社收购香蕉时，毕永成“下决心要斗垮中南区合作总社”。在给中南区合作总社代购煤油、糖等项任务中，毕永成盗窃集团在装油时故意超过油桶容量，致油桶炸裂。在去年一项交易中，就漏油达八千斤。特级松香是不准出口的，毕永成盗窃集团就将特级松香卖给昆和行，在发票上将特级改为一级，包庇出口，破坏对外贸易政策。
    毕永成盗窃集团曾明目张胆地出卖商情，出卖国家计划。如大盗窃犯何湛元窃据工业品科的股长职位后，把广东省合作总社和中南区合作总社收购煤油汽油的计划、资金、价格全部出卖给深圳新华行。在去年收购五十亿元的煤油交易中，他在半年内预付给该行货款十七亿元，让新华行投机倒把。何犯还纵使新华行走私漏税，在煤油内搀水搀杂。在半年内，新华行获暴利三十多亿元，国家损失达十七亿元。大盗窃犯黄拾是裕发柴栏的股东之一，他打进广东省合作总社后，把全部柴炭情报告诉裕发柴栏，并串通广州市近百家柴炭行，进行空头交易。大盗窃犯黄家澄，负责收购百货的工作。他把广东省合作总社一九五一年第四季度收购胶鞋的计划预告给济华胶厂，使该厂抬高胶鞋价格，捣乱市场。这一盗窃集团并有计划地盗窃和积压国家资金，造成国家的严重损失。去年八月，大盗窃犯周玉良办理北江杉木。他和连县合作总社主任张正芳勾结，采购杉木八次。当杉木旺销的时候，他把货直接卖给私商启泰杉木栏，不向省合作总社交货。经过这几宗杉木交易，他们获取暴利四十亿元。去年夏季，毕永成、吴涿章收购价值十二亿元的荔枝干。当荔枝干畅销时，他们故意压着不抛售，等到淡季才卖，到现在还有十亿元的荔枝干积压在仓库，腐烂生虫。大盗窃犯胡醒唤、冼波经手收购各种糖，先后四次，总值达一百一十亿元。他们和上海糖商勾结，把白糖低价卖给上海糖商，或者在糖内搀泥搀沙等。在这几宗糖的交易中，国家损失数十亿元。他们用高价收购黄烟，总值三十三亿元，全部不合规格；收购黄麻，总值十八亿元，百分之七十不合规格。这些物资长期不能脱售。
    不到一年的时间，毕永成大盗窃集团用各种方式榨取国家的财产及所获得的暴利估计在一百亿元以上，仅毕犯个人贪污即达二十一亿元，而国家直接和间接所受的损失一时还无法统计。他们篡夺了广东省合作总社的重要业务部门，利用“合法”的地位，包庇走私、漏税、出口。他们使广东省合作总社变质，使受害的农民抱怨合作社，而资本家却在一旁兴高采烈。不到一年的时间，这一盗窃集团中的主要成员都成了大富翁，毕永成则成为六个大商行的股东。但是，他们的“好景”并不长。在反贪污、反盗窃斗争中，他们的真相全部被揭穿，他们的阴谋全部暴露。这伙罪犯中罪大恶极的分子已被逮捕。
