    I Was Tempered in the Great "Five-Anti" Movement
    Liu Dezhen, Labor Model of Shijingshan Power Plant
    In January, the "Five-Anti" movement began in Beijing. I participated in the "Five-Anti" movement in the Seventh District of Beijing. In this great class struggle, I was tempered and further realized the greatness of the Party and Chairman Mao.
    The "Five-Anti" in the Seventh District started with the hardware industry. I was responsible for the work of the trade union. At the beginning, the whole work was without a clue, and the inspection team had not yet been formed. The capitalists said carelessly, "It's nothing, it will pass in a few days!" Shop employees and workers were difficult to mobilize due to long-term deception and concealment; when meetings were held, only half of them attended, and they always chatted idly and couldn't get to the point. After working for a few days without any progress, I was very anxious and kept thinking about how to break this situation. After repeated enlightenment and instructions from the leadership, plus my own experience in the work, I realized that shop employees and industrial workers are different, so the methods of mobilizing shop employees should also be different, which requires more patience in persuasion and education.
    The district decided to focus on Yixinyin Hardware Store to start the inspection; we were sent to mobilize the shop employees. We held shop employee group meetings on the one hand and conducted individual talks on the other. I talked to Zheng Ziping, who was in charge of external affairs. He was a young man. In the conversation, I learned that his father was an elementary school teacher and is now participating in land reform in the south. He had attended middle school, but dropped out of school to learn business, and is now a "second apprentice," and will be able to become a "manager" in two years. In response to these circumstances, I first talked to him about the future of the working class, using my own personal experience and the situation in our factory, talking about the status of workers after liberation, and talking about the socialist system in the Soviet Union; and pointed out that it is wrong and has no future for workers to want to become capitalists, which made his idea of becoming a manager waver. I also told him that his father must have gained a lot from participating in land reform; if he doesn't make progress, he will lag behind the older generation. I talked about my own past suffering and the situation after liberation, combined with his dropping out of school and the suffering he suffered as an apprentice, to enlighten his awareness. I said, "Standing on broken floor tiles, leaning against bright pillars, being beaten and scolded, what have you done to this energetic young man!" After listening, he shed tears and began to become aware. Because he was a senior staff member, he had helped the manager do some bad things in the past, and I estimated that he must have concerns. So, I also told him about the policies of the "Five-Anti" movement. Then, he began to talk about how he had been ordered by the manager to use black steel wire, which was only worth 100,000 yuan bought in the small market, to replace white steel wire, and sold it to a state-owned factory for more than one million yuan. I also compared him with my own situation and educated him: "Last year, I made a rationalization proposal in the factory, which was beneficial to the country, and I won an award, look how glorious! You did this bad thing for the capitalist, harmed the country, were scolded, and didn't get any benefit yourself. If you don't talk about it, others will, and you will have to take the blame for the capitalist." When he talked about a problem, I encouraged him to dispel his concerns. That day, he talked about a total of six problems. The next day, I talked to him again, moved him with class friendship. The room was very cold, and I put my coat over him. After a long time, I asked him if he wanted to go home to rest. Every time he talked about a problem, I affirmed his achievements; and explained the policy to improve his awareness. In this way, he talked about more than 20 cases of capitalists' tax evasion, stealing bid prices, bribery, and theft in one night. I felt that he could be a backbone, so I told him how to be an activist and assigned him work tasks.
    On the third day, the inspection team arrived. We cooperated with the inspection team to fully mobilize the workers and tirelessly carried out persuasion and education. "Senior apprentice" Lü Baozhen resisted the movement at the beginning, and we mobilized everyone to isolate him; the next day, he made a self-criticism and stood with everyone. Within a few days, the Yixinyin Hardware Store employees reported more than 200 cases of illegal activities by the capitalists. The main problems were grasped, the inspection team's work was carried out, and the "Five-Anti" of the hardware industry was fully launched. Shop employees rose up to report the illegal activities of the capitalists, formed six "group alliances," three "reasoning teams," and extracted more than 80 cadres to participate in the "Five-Anti" work of other industries. Everyone's enthusiasm was high, working through the night.
    In order to further improve the awareness of shop employees and workers, and to make them tear off their masks with the capitalists and draw a clear class line, we organized face-to-face reasoning struggles. The capitalists revealed their ugly faces, some crying, some making trouble, some feigning illness, and some feigning death. Their conspiracies and tricks were ruthlessly exposed by the workers. The workers bravely and wisely defeated the prestige of the capitalists.
    After the People's Government announced the "Standards and Methods for Categorizing and Handling Industrial and Commercial Households," the workers said happily: "We have a clue!" "We have a way!" Pointing at the profiteers, they said, "If you do bad things and don't honestly confess your crimes, we will 'upgrade' your treatment." The workers carefully held the pass, making the illegal capitalists bow their heads and confess their crimes.
    In the past three months, in this great struggle, I have deeply realized the greatness of the Party and Chairman Mao. In the past, I never thought that the bourgeoisie's attack on us would be so rampant. Even at the beginning of the "Five-Anti," I thought it would be over in ten or eight days. The deeper the movement goes, the more problems are discovered, and the more I feel Chairman Mao's brilliance. Without this movement, I really don't know how much more loss the country's construction would suffer!
    At the same time, I have a deeper understanding of the greatness of the power of the masses. In the factory, the Party often educated me to rely on the masses, and I also have this experience in my work. After this education of facts, my understanding has been further improved: without mobilizing shop employees and workers, the "Five-Anti" movement cannot be carried out; without relying on the masses, nothing can be done well; to rely on the masses, we must first improve the awareness of the masses.

### 我在伟大的“五反”运动中受到了锻炼

    我在伟大的“五反”运动中受到了锻炼
    石景山发电厂劳动模范　刘德珍
    一月间，北京市的“五反”运动开始了。我参加了北京市第七区的“五反”运动。在这场伟大的阶级斗争中，我得到了锻炼，更进一步体会到了党和毛主席的伟大。
    第七区的“五反”是从五金业开始的。我负责做工会工作。开始时，整个工作没个头绪，检查组也还没有组成。资本家满不在乎地说：“没啥，几天就过去啦！”店员工人由于长期被欺骗蒙蔽，很难发动；开会时，只有一半到会，还老扯闲天，扯不上正题。搞了几天还没有什么头绪，我心中非常急躁，老在想怎么才能打开这个局面。经过领导方面再三启发和指示，再加上自己在工作中的体验，认识到了店员工人和产业工人不同，因此发动店员工人的方法也应当有所不同，这须要用更大的耐心进行说服教育工作。
    区里决定以义信永五金号为重点，开始进行检查；我们被派去发动店员工人。我们一面召开店员工人小组会，一面进行个别谈话。我和跑外的郑资平谈话。他是个青年。在谈话中，我知道他父亲是个小学教员，现在在南方参加土地改革。他曾上过中学，失学后才学买卖，现在是“二师兄”，再过两年便可以当“掌柜的”了。我针对这些情况，首先和他谈工人阶级的前途，以我的切身体验和我们工厂的情况，谈工人在解放以后的地位，谈苏联的社会主义制度；并指出工人想当资本家是错误的，没有前途的，这使他想当掌柜的思想动摇了。我还告诉他，他父亲参加土地改革一定有很大的收获；自己再不进步，就会落在老年人后面。我谈了我自身过去受的苦和解放后的情况，结合他的失学和当学徒时受的苦，启发他的觉悟。我说：“站碎了方砖，靠倒了明柱，挨打挨骂，把你这个生气勃勃的小伙子折磨成什么样啦！”他听后滴下了眼泪，开始有了觉悟。因为他是个高级职员，过去曾帮经理做过一些坏事，我估计他一定会有顾虑。于是，我又和他讲“五反”运动的政策。随后，他便开始谈出他曾奉经理之命，用在小市上买的只值十万元的黑钢丝顶替白钢丝，以一百多万元的价钱卖给国营某厂。我又以自身的情况和他比，教育他：“去年我在厂里，因为我提了合理化建议，对国家有利，得了奖，你看多光荣！你为资本家干了这坏事，害了国家，挨人骂，自己一点没得到好处。你如不谈，别人谈了，你还得给资本家垫背。”当他谈出一个问题后，我便鼓励他，打消他的顾虑。那天，他共谈了六个问题。第二天，我又和他谈，以阶级友情感动他。屋子很冷，我把大衣给他披上。时间长了，问他是否要回家休息。每当他谈出一个问题时，我便肯定他的成绩；并说明政策，提高他的觉悟。这样，他一晚便谈出资本家偷税漏税、偷标底、行贿、盗窃等行为二十多件。我感到他可以做一个骨干了，就又给他讲怎样做一个积极分子，分配给他工作任务。
    第三天，检查组到了。我们就配合检查组全面发动工人，不厌倦地进行说服教育。“大师兄”吕宝祯开始时抗拒运动，我们发动大家把他孤立起来；第二天，他自己便做了检讨，并和大家站在一起了。几天内，义信永五金号店员检举资本家违法的事情达二百多件。主要问题抓住了，检查组工作展开了，五金业的“五反”就全面开展起来。店员纷纷起来检举资本家的违法行为，组成六个“组联”，三个“说理队”，并抽出八十多个干部参加了其他行业的“五反”工作。大家情绪高涨，彻夜工作。
    为了进一步提高店员工人的觉悟，要他们和资本家撕破面皮，划清阶级界限，我们组织了面对面的说理斗争。资本家丑态毕露，有的哭，有的闹，有的装病，有的装死。他们的阴谋诡计，被工人们毫不留情地揭穿了。工人们有勇有谋地打垮了资本家的威风。
    人民政府公布了“关于工商户分类处理的标准和办法”后，工人兴高采烈地说：“有谱啦！”“有办法啦！”指着奸商说：“干了坏事如还不好好坦白认罪，咱就给你‘升级’处理。”工人认真地把住关口，使违法资本家俯首认罪。
    三个月来，在这伟大的斗争中，我更深深地体会到党和毛主席的伟大。从前，我没想到资产阶级对我们的进攻是这样猖狂。甚至“五反”开始时，我还以为搞它十天八天就完了。运动越深入，发现的问题越多，自己也越感到毛主席的英明。不经过这个运动，祖国的建设真不知道还要受到多少损失！
    同时，我更深刻地认识了群众力量的伟大。在工厂时，党经常教育我要依靠群众，自己在工作中也有这种体会。经过这次事实的教育，使我的认识更提高了一步：不发动店员工人，“五反”运动就开展不起来；不依靠群众，是什么事情也做不好的；要依靠群众，首先要提高群众的觉悟。
