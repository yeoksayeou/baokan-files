    Interview with Mr. Saranamkara, Representative of the Ceylon Trade Union
    Mr. Saranamkara, the Ceylon trade union representative invited to China to attend the "May Day" celebrations, is the first chairman of the Ceylon Trade Union Federation and a devout Buddhist. On the day of his arrival in Beijing, he visited the Yonghe Temple to see the lamas.

    Why did Mr. Saranamkara visit the Yonghe Temple as soon as he arrived in Beijing? He told reporters, "Recently, some newspapers in Ceylon have been propagating that Buddhists are being persecuted in New China. These newspapers are the mouthpieces of American imperialism. The United States is spreading rumors and sabotaging New China like a mad dog." To explore the truth of this matter, Mr. Saranamkara specifically visited the Yonghe Temple in Beijing.

    "After I arrived in Beijing," he said, "I went to this oldest temple and talked with the lamas for a long time; and I walked through every corner of this temple." The lamas told him that during the Kuomintang rule, the army was stationed in this temple, destroying it everywhere and burning scriptures as firewood. On the contrary, under the leadership of the People's Government, the lamas not only had freedom of religious belief, but also received genuine care.

    Mr. Saranamkara said angrily, "American imperialism is spreading many rumors to slander New China; but these rumors will be shattered, because the truth will prevail."

    Therefore, he said, "I want to tell the Asian people the truth: China not only has freedom of religious belief, but also has genuine national equality. I want to appeal to the Asian people not to listen to the rumors of American imperialism. American imperialism wants to deceive the Asian people and enslave the Asian people."

    He said that everything in New China formed a strong contrast to what he had seen and heard on his way from Ceylon to Hong Kong. As early as when China was just liberated, he had a great desire to come to New China. This wish was finally realized when the Ceylon Trade Union Federation decided to send a delegation to Beijing at its invitation. Whether in his own country or in the places he passed on the way, he always saw countless children wandering and begging in the streets. He said, "In Hong Kong, I saw many beggar children sitting on the sidewalks. I was wearing Ceylonese clothes and walking on the streets of Hong Kong, and I was subjected to much ridicule and teasing."

    Hong Kong and China are only separated by a body of water, but they are two different worlds. He said, "I entered China. Although I don't understand the Chinese language, I can see from the faces of the Chinese people that they are living happily and working actively. Here, no one laughs at me, and everyone is very friendly to me."

    From Guangzhou to Hankou, from Hankou to Beijing, whether on the train or at the station, people greeted him with smiles and welcoming expressions. Along the way, he saw people working and producing intensively. He didn't see any begging children.

    Mr. Saranamkara told an interesting story: When he was walking in Zhongshan Park in Hankou, he met a hundred or so elementary school students; they swarmed up and warmly surrounded him, asking him "where he came from and where he was going," and also asked him to sign his name. "I was very touched," he said.

    "This is completely different from the street children in Hong Kong. Along the way, I met countless people who treated me like this. Some people even said to me: From your expression, I can also understand that our thoughts are the same."

    Finally, he said, "The Ceylon Trade Union Federation's selection of representatives to participate in the May Day celebrations in New China is the first step in strengthening the unity and cooperation between the two peoples. After I go back, I will spread the friendly spirit of the Chinese people towards the Ceylonese people that I have seen to every corner. The Ceylonese people will certainly respond to the Chinese people with a friendly spirit. This will further strengthen the friendly unity between the Chinese working class and the Ceylonese working class. When the Ceylonese people understand that the Chinese working class has become the true masters of China, they will rise up more strongly to fight for freedom, independence and peace."

    访锡兰工会代表撒拉南卡拉
    应邀来中国参加“五一”节观礼的锡兰工会代表撒拉南卡拉是锡兰工会联合会的第一届主席，他是个虔诚的佛教徒。他在抵达北京的当天，就去访问了雍和宫的喇嘛。
    为什么撒拉南卡拉一到北京就去访问雍和宫呢？他向记者说：“最近锡兰有些报纸大肆宣传，说佛教徒在新中国遭到了迫害。这些报纸是美帝国主义的喉舌。美国正像疯狗一样地造谣破坏新中国。”撒拉南卡拉为了探索这件事情的真相，专门访问了北京雍和宫。
    “当我抵达北京之后，”他说：“就到这座最古老的庙里，和喇嘛们谈了很久；并且走遍了这座庙的每个角落。”喇嘛们告诉他，在国民党统治时期，军队驻在这个庙里，到处糟蹋，把经卷当柴烧。相反地，在人民政府的领导下，喇嘛不但有了信仰宗教的自由，还得到了真正的照顾。
    撒拉南卡拉愤慨地说：“美帝国主义散布着许许多多诬蔑新中国的谣言；但是，这些谣言是要破灭的，因为真理必将获胜。”
    因此，他说：“我要把真相告诉亚洲人民：中国不仅有宗教信仰自由，而且也已经有了真正的民族平等。我要向亚洲人民呼吁，不要听信美帝国主义的谣言。美帝国主义是要欺骗亚洲人民，奴役亚洲人民的。”
    他说：新中国的一切，和他在从锡兰到香港途中的所见所闻，形成了一个强烈的对比。早在中国刚解放的时候，他就抱着很大的愿望，要到新中国来。他这个愿望，在锡兰工会联合会决定应邀派遣代表团到北京的时候，终于实现了。他无论是在他本国，无论是在途中经过的地方，他总是看到无数孩子，在街头流浪、求乞。他说：“在香港，我看到人行道上坐着许多乞丐儿童。我穿着锡兰的服装，走在香港的街道上，受到许多嘲笑和戏弄。”
    香港和中国只隔着一条水，然而是两个世界。他说：“我进了中国。虽然我不懂得中国的语言，但我从中国人民的脸上，可以看出他们生活的愉快和工作的积极。在这里，没有人嘲笑我，所有的人都对我非常友爱。”
    从广州到汉口，从汉口到北京，无论是车上，是站上，人们都含着微笑，带着欢迎的表情，招呼他。他沿途看到的是正在紧张工作着、生产着的人。看不见讨饭的孩子。
    撒拉南卡拉叙述了一个有趣的故事：在汉口，他到中山公园散步的时候，遇上了百来个小学生；他们一拥而上，亲热地包围了他，问他“从那里来，到那里去”，还要他签名。“我很感动，”他说：
    “这和香港的流浪儿童是完全不同了。沿途，我遇见无数无数的人，都是如此对待我。有的老百姓还向我说：从你的表情也可以了解，我们的思想是共同的。”
    最后，他说：“锡兰工会联合会选派代表来参加新中国的五一节，这是加强两国人民团结合作的第一步。我回去以后，要把所见到的中国人民对锡兰人民的友好精神，传到每个角落去。锡兰人民也一定会以友好精神来回答中国人民。这样就使得中国工人阶级和锡兰工人阶级的友好团结更为加强。当了解到中国工人阶级成了中国的真正主人翁以后，锡兰人民就会更坚强地起来为自由、独立与和平而奋斗。”（克夫、荫槐）（附图片）
