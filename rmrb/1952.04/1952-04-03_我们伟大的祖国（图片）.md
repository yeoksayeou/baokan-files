Our Great Motherland

The Yellow River irrigation project to benefit the Wei River area successfully completed its trial water release on March 12th, and will officially release water to irrigate 230,000 mu of farmland in April. This is the first time in China's history that water has been diverted from the lower reaches of the Yellow River for farmland irrigation, and it is also a groundbreaking undertaking in harnessing the Yellow River. There are many sluice gates on this main irrigation canal. This sluice gate is releasing water, and farmers from far and near have come to visit.
