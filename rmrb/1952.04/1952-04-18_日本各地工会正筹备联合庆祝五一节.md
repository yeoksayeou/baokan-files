Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 17th.— Trade unions across Japan are brewing a united front to jointly celebrate May Day.

The "Wage Joint Struggle Liaison Council," composed of the All Japan Automobile Industry Workers' Union and others, with a membership of 340,000, has submitted a request to the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (referred to as "Sohyo"), advocating the formation of a unified labor front to jointly celebrate May Day. The "Wage Joint Struggle Liaison Council" has also proposed May Day slogans such as "Oppose War," "Demand Independence," and "Abolish the Separate Peace Treaty and the U.S.-Japan 'Security Treaty'."

Although the central leadership of "Sohyo" has expressed a negative attitude towards jointly celebrating May Day, various regions are actively promoting the unification movement. Osaka has already organized a unified May Day committee; Nagano Prefecture is also preparing to jointly celebrate May Day.

In the southern district of Tokyo, the All Japan Automobile Industry Workers' Union has sent invitations to 400 trade unions, inviting them to gather on April 25 to prepare for the joint celebration of May Day. In Kanagawa Prefecture, it has been decided to jointly celebrate May Day, and a workers' rally against fascist bills will be held on April 29. Kyoto, Shizuoka, Fukuoka and other places are also preparing to jointly celebrate May Day.

The Youth Department of the Yokogawa Electric Company Trade Union, affiliated with "Sohyo," has decided to cooperate with the Japan Congress of Industrial Unions on the issue of opposing conscription.

In order to obstruct workers from celebrating their own festival, the reactionary Yoshida government has unreasonably prohibited the use of the plaza in front of the Imperial Palace on May Day. "Sohyo" filed a lawsuit with the Tokyo District Court on April 4, demanding the cancellation of this illegal ban. The lawsuit pointed out that the plaza in front of the Imperial Palace is a park plaza directly provided by the state for public use and is widely used by the people in normal times. Prohibiting gatherings and parades in the plaza on May Day is a restriction on the freedom of group action, and this ban is unconstitutional and illegal.

    日本各地工会正筹备联合庆祝五一节
    【新华社十七日讯】东京消息：日本各地工会正在酝酿组成统一战线，联合庆祝五一节。
    由全日本汽车产业工会等组成的、拥有会员三十四万人的“工资共同斗争联络会”，已向日本工会总评议会（简称“总评”）提出要求，主张组成劳工统一战线，联合庆祝五一节。“工资共同斗争联络会”并提出了“反对战争”、“要求独立”、“废除单独和约和美日‘安全条约’”等五一节口号。
    尽管“总评”的中央领导机构对联合庆祝五一节一事表示消极，但是，各地区却正在积极推进统一运动。大阪已经组织了统一的五一节委员会；长野县也在筹备联合庆祝五一节。
    在东京南部地区，全日本汽车产业工会已向四百个工会发出请柬，邀请大家在四月二十五日集会，筹备联合庆祝五一节的事宜。在神奈川县，已决定联合庆祝五一节，将于四月二十九日召开反对法西斯法案的工人大会。京都、静冈、福冈等地也都在筹备联合庆祝五一节。
    “总评”所属的横河电机公司工会青年部，决定在反对征兵的问题上，要和日本产业别工会会议合作。
    吉田反动政府为了阻挠工人庆祝自己的节日，无理禁止在五一节使用皇宫前广场。“总评”已于四月四日向东京地方法院起诉，要求取消这一非法的禁令。起诉书指出：皇宫前广场是国家直接供公众使用的公园广场，平时广泛地被国民所利用。禁止五一节在该广场集会游行，是对团体行动自由的限制，这一禁令是违宪的和非法的。
