    Qingdao Electric Power Bureau's Power Supply Section Employees
    Actively Seek Ways to Reduce Line Loss
    Increasing the State's Revenue by More Than 500 Million Yuan in March
    Comrade Editor: The Qingdao Electric Power Bureau's Power Supply Section reduced line loss by more than 32% compared to the plan in March, increasing the state's revenue by more than 500 million yuan. This is the result of the increased class consciousness and active work of the Power Supply Section employees after the "Three-Anti" movement. Huang Changjing, the head of the Power Supply Section, personally led the employees in field testing the work of cleaning high-voltage lines with water while they were still energized. The success of this experiment not only ensured safe power supply but also solved the difficulty of having to shut down power for cleaning in the past, reducing unnecessary power outages and laying the foundation for the production increase and thrift campaign. Workers Wang Xishan, Du Shengxiang, and others walked more than twenty miles at night to observe the lines and inspect the wires. If they found any problems, they always tried their best to fix them before they felt comfortable going back. Workers Wang Keyou and others discovered a situation where the lines were sparking. They immediately checked repeatedly, sometimes having to wait until dawn because repairs couldn't be done without shutting off the power.

    青岛电业局供电科职工
    积极设法降低线路损失
    三月份给国家增加五亿多元的收入
    编辑同志：青岛电业局供电科三月份的线路损失比计划降低百分之三十二强，给国家增加了五亿元以上的收入。这是供电科职工“三反”运动以后阶级觉悟提高，积极工作的结果。供电科科长黄长敬曾亲自带领职工，实地试验了带电用水清扫高压线路的工作。这一试验的成功，不只保证了安全供电，还解决了过去非要停电清扫不可的困难，减少了不必要的停电，为增产节约运动打下了基础。工人王希山、杜升祥等在夜间走了二十多里路去观察线路，检查电线。如果发现有问题，他们总是想尽办法弄妥当才放心回去。工人王克友等检查出线路有喷火情况，他们立即反复查看，有时他们必须等到天亮，因为不停电不能修理。
