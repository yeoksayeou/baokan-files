Taiyuan Jinsheng Textile Factory Li Dongshan Group
Creates New Method to Shorten Car Cleaning Time

    The workers of the Li Dongshan car cleaning group of the fine yarn maintenance section of the Taiyuan Jinsheng Textile Factory, improved their class consciousness during the "Three-Anti" campaign and created a new method to shorten car cleaning time. The Li Dongshan group has a total of seven people and cleans four cars. They originally needed four hours to clean one car, which greatly hindered production. After research, they felt that to shorten the car cleaning time, they must do a good job of preparation before car cleaning, and the parts should be handled up and down in a regular manner during car cleaning. Therefore, they did the work of removing cotton from the spindle belt pulley, oiling the horn, and brushing the cotton from the spindle seat and the winch bottom, which were originally done after stopping the car, before stopping the car, which saved a lot of time. For example, removing cotton from the spindle belt pulley takes only ten minutes before stopping, but twenty minutes after stopping. When cleaning the parts on the car, they also made sure to go up and down in order. First, take off the small velvet roller, velvet roller yellow, and large iron roller, then take off the leather roller, tip, weight support, and leather ring frame, and finally remove the roller. After the entire group divided the work and cooperated in cleaning, they reinstalled them one by one in order. As a result, the car cleaning time was reduced from four hours per car to one and a half hours, which reduced the downtime by ten hours per day and produced an additional twenty yarns of one hundred and ninety pounds, which means an annual increase in production of 1.354 billion yuan.

    太原晋生纺织厂李东山小组
    创造缩短擦车时间的新方法
    太原晋生纺织厂细纱保全部李东山擦车小组职工，在“三反”中提高了阶级觉悟，创造了缩短擦车时间的新方法。李东山小组共七人，擦四部车。他们原擦一部车需四小时，对生产妨碍很大。经过研究，他们感到要缩短擦车时间，必须做好擦车前的准备工作，擦车时上下零件要有规律。于是，他们便把原在停车后做的扣锭带盘上的棉花、在羊角上加油、刷锭座上和绞车底的棉花，都在停车前做好了，这样就节省了很多时间。如扣锭带盘上棉花，停车前扣仅需十分钟，停车后则需二十分钟。擦车上的零件时，也做到有次序地上、下。开始先取小毛辊、毛辊黄、大铁辊，以后再取皮辊、梢子、重托、皮圈架，最后把罗拉取下。全组分工合作擦洗后，再按次序一一安装。擦车时间因此便由每部需四时减为一时半，使每天可少停车十小时，多产二十支纱一百九十磅，即每年可增产十三亿五千四百万元。（刘振文）
