Xinhua News Agency, Delhi, January 31st, TASS: According to the "Indian Express," the All-India Peace Council cabled Indian Prime Minister Nehru, currently in London. The cable stated: The Indian people are outraged by the remarks made by some American representatives about the possible use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other nuclear weapons to attack China. The U.S. government must be warned that the Indian people resolutely condemn plans to launch an atomic war.

The All-India Peace Council assured Nehru that the Indian peace movement would support any steps Nehru takes to withdraw American troops from Chinese territory, Taiwan, and Chinese territorial waters.

Xinhua News Agency, London, January 1st, TASS: The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference opened in London on January 31st. The conference was chaired by British Prime Minister Churchill. Representatives from the United Kingdom, India, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Ceylon, Pakistan, and the Central African Federation attended the meeting.

The meeting was held in secret. According to Reuters, Churchill outlined the international situation at the meeting on the 31st. The participating countries' representatives then analyzed the international situation from their governments' perspectives.

The British newspapers attached great importance to the conference. The influential "Manchester Guardian" pointed out: In preparing for this conference, it was originally planned to focus primarily on economic and military issues, but in light of the recent serious changes in the international situation, "there are greatly increased indications that international affairs will occupy an important place in the conference."

According to the "Manchester Guardian" and other bourgeois newspapers, the important international issue to be discussed at this conference is the tense situation created in the Taiwan area by the United States' aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China. These newspapers openly stated that efforts will be made at the meeting to exert pressure on India and other Asian countries that condemn American interference in China's internal affairs, forcing them to support the infamous so-called "ceasefire" plan in the Taiwan area.

The "Manchester Guardian" also believes that another equally important international issue to be considered at the conference is the problem caused by the increasingly strong opposition to the plan to arm West Germany. The newspaper emphasized: "The increasingly strong opposition within West Germany to ratifying the Paris Accords before holding a Four-Power conference... shows that the issue of rearming Germany is far from resolved."

    全印和平理事会致电尼赫鲁
    决定支持他采取使美军撤出台湾的步骤
    英联邦总理会议在伦敦开幕将讨论国际问题
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社德里一月三十一日讯：据“印度快报”消息，全印和平理事会打电报给目前在伦敦的印度总理尼赫鲁。电报说：印度人民对某些美国代表发表可能使用原子武器、氢武器和其他核子武器进攻中国的谈话感到愤慨。必须警告美国政府，印度人民坚决谴责发动原子战争的计划。
    全印和平理事会向尼赫鲁保证，印度保卫和平运动将支持尼赫鲁所采取的使美国军队撤出中国领土台湾和中国领海的任何步骤。
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英联邦总理会议一月三十一日在伦敦开幕。会议由英国首相邱吉尔担任主席。出席会议的，有英国、印度、加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰、南非、锡兰、巴基斯坦和中非联邦的代表们。
    会议是秘密进行的。据路透社报道，邱吉尔在三十一日的会议上概述了国际局势。然后参加会议的各国代表从自己政府的立场来分析国际局势。
    英国报纸非常重视这次会议。有影响的“曼彻斯特卫报”指出：在准备这次会议的时候，原来是计划把会议的主要注意力放在经济问题和军事问题上的，但是鉴于国际局势中最近发生的严重变化，“国际事务要在会议中占重要地位的迹象大大增加了”。
    据“曼彻斯特卫报”及其他资产阶级报纸说，这次会议要讨论的重要的国际事务问题，就是由于美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行动而在台湾地区产生的紧张局势问题。这些报纸公开说，会上将设法对印度和斥责美国干涉中国内政的其他亚洲国家施行压力，迫使它们支持臭名远扬的所谓台湾地区“停火”计划。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”又认为，会议要考虑的另一个同样重要的国际局势问题，就是由于武装西德的计划遭到越来越强烈的反对而引起的问题。这家报纸强调：“西德国内越来越强烈地反对在举行四国会议以前批准巴黎协定……这表明重新武装德国的问题绝没有解决。”
