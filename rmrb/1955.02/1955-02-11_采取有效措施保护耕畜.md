    Take Effective Measures to Protect Draught Animals
    Lian Zhishui  Lu Lixian

    From October to mid-December last year, a serious phenomenon of farmers selling livestock in large numbers occurred in Xiangyuan County, Shanxi Province. Some members of agricultural production cooperatives even went to Tunliu, Changzhi and other places to sell livestock. In early November, an average of about 100 animals were on the market per fair; in mid-November, there were about 150 animals; and by late November, this had increased to about 200 animals. Among the animals on the market, young animals accounted for about 30 percent, middle-aged animals accounted for about 50 percent, and sick or weak animals accounted for only about 20 percent. In just over two months, the county sold more than 200 animals, and another 455 animals were planned to be sold, causing livestock prices to plummet.

    Why did this phenomenon occur? According to survey materials from Jiuzhuang and other townships, there are various reasons for farmers selling livestock in large numbers.

    Some agricultural cooperatives undervalued livestock when they were used as shares, and some middle peasants were unwilling to raise livestock. The average price of each animal in the Shihui Village Agricultural Cooperative in Hanbao Township was 25 percent lower than the market price. Cooperative member Cui Muliang said: "The agricultural cooperative is unfair, and whoever has livestock suffers. Others offered 1.25 million yuan for my animal, but I was unwilling to sell it; the cooperative only offered 950,000 yuan. I would rather sell it to others than give it to the cooperative." Later, he sold the animal to another township for 1.1 million yuan. Some well-off middle peasants with complete carts and horses were worried that they would not get cash after livestock and farm tools were collectivized, so they preferred to sell their livestock for less money rather than contribute them to the cooperative. Ren Wenjin, a member of the Duanhe Township Agricultural Cooperative, sold a good mule worth more than 2 million yuan for only 1.6 million yuan. Some agricultural cooperatives put forward incorrect slogans when pricing livestock, such as: "Good livestock are welcome to join the cooperative, bad livestock are not wanted by the cooperative." Therefore, some poor households had no choice but to sell their poor livestock that they were raising together. Among the farmers who sold livestock in large numbers, speculative livestock dealers became active. They not only speculated for profit, but also spread rumors and deceive, inciting farmers to sell livestock. In addition, some agricultural cooperative cadres and farmers lacked a correct understanding of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, which was also one of the reasons why some farmers were unwilling to raise livestock.

    In order to solve this problem, the Xiangyuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party first organized the Party organizations in various townships to carry out education on various policies of agricultural production cooperatives in new and old agricultural cooperatives in conjunction with the work of unified grain purchase; and convened a meeting of chairmen and accountants of 579 new and old agricultural cooperatives in the county to study ways to protect draught animals, and improve the ideological awareness of cooperative cadres and members. Many cooperative cadres reviewed their mistakes in implementing policies after studying the policies. The chairman of the Zhuangli Township Agricultural Cooperative reviewed and said: "Not wanting the livestock of poor households is a wrong practice of neglecting reliance on poor peasants. In the future, we must always carry out our work in accordance with the class line." Hao Dajiu, chairman of the Changlong Township Agricultural Cooperative, said: "Upon reflection, I have done two terrible things. When the cooperative was established, I was only afraid that everyone would not want to join the cooperative, so I said to everyone: After joining the cooperative, you don’t have to worry about anything yourself... As a result, some households sold their livestock before joining the cooperative. After the cooperative was established, I told the members again: All households with livestock must join the cooperative, and the money for livestock evaluation will be lent to the cooperative, which will be repaid in five years. Cooperative member Shen Guangzhen (middle peasant) was afraid that he would not get cash after the livestock joined the cooperative, so he sold the livestock in less than two days. These two things are all consequences of my failure to implement the policy well; I must study the policy well before doing work in the future." In the process of educating cooperative members, the idea of "selling carts and horses before joining the cooperative" was criticized. Li Guilin, a member of the Jiuzhuang Xingguang Agricultural Cooperative, said: "After this study, I feel much clearer in my heart. The agricultural cooperative is for everyone to contribute and everyone to get rich. It is wrong to sell livestock and rely solely on the cooperative; I will not sell my good mule." After education, six cooperative members with livestock in this cooperative did not sell their livestock, and voluntarily reported 7.5 dan of livestock feed. The cooperative also increased the purchase of three head of female livestock, preparing to lay the foundation for the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry and animal husbandry.

    In order to eliminate the ideological concerns of some farmers about the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, county leaders also went deep into the grassroots and promoted the publicity and education of the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain in the county by districts. After many members of the Nangou Village Agricultural Cooperative in Wuyang Township dispelled their concerns, they not only did not complain that there was no feed for livestock, but also sold a lot of surplus grain.

    The county leading organs also convened a meeting of representatives of agricultural cooperative feeders to exchange feeding experience. Feeder Li Fuxiao introduced their cooperative's experience in feeding and protecting livestock: feeding livestock should be done on time and in quantity, so that livestock should also be fed on time and in quantity; the feeder and the user should sign a contract and explain the situation of the livestock to each other. The meeting also introduced the experience of feeding livestock in separate troughs and keeping forage, animal bodies, and livestock pens clean. The meeting criticized the erroneous behavior of some irresponsible feeders who fed fat livestock thin.

    At the same time, the county supply and marketing cooperative also strengthened the management of the livestock market in accordance with the instructions of the county party committee, so as to achieve stable market, fair prices, and eliminate speculative and deceptive livestock dealers.

    After taking the above measures, Xiangyuan quickly stopped the phenomenon of farmers selling livestock in large numbers. According to statistics on January 14 this year, 396 agricultural cooperatives in the county originally planned to sell 455 livestock. Now, except for some old livestock that can be sold, no good livestock are sold. Many agricultural cooperatives have also bought back livestock from places with more livestock. According to statistics from 427 agricultural cooperatives, 169 livestock have been bought back recently, and more than 300 livestock have been exchanged for good livestock using bad livestock.

    采取有效措施保护耕畜
    连治水  路礼先
    去年十月到十二月中旬，山西襄垣县发生了农民大量出卖牲口的严重现象。部分农业生产合作社社员甚至到屯留、长治等地出卖牲口。十一月上旬每集平均上市牲口一百头左右，中旬有一百五十头左右，到下旬就增加到二百头左右。上市牲口中，青年牲口约占百分之三十，中年牲口约占百分之五十，有毛病的或老弱的牲口只占百分之二十左右。短短的两个多月全县就卖出了牲口二百多头，还有四百五十五头牲口准备出卖，牲口价格暴跌。
    为什么会发生这种现象呢？根据九庄等乡的调查材料看，农民大量卖牲口是有各种原因的。
    有些农业社对牲口入股作价太低，部分中农不愿养牲口。韩保乡石灰村农业社平均每头牲口作价低于市价百分之二十五。社员崔木良说：“农业社不公道，谁有牲口谁吃亏。我的牲口别人出一百二十五万元，我还不愿卖；社里只给作九十五万元，宁卖给别人，也不归社，”后来他到底把这头牲口以一百一十万元卖给外乡了。有一些车马齐全的老中农担心牲口、农具公有后捞不到现钱，因此宁愿少卖钱，不愿将牲口作价归社。段河乡农业社社员任文锦，把价值二百多万元的好骡子，以一百六十万元就卖掉了。有部分农业社在对牲口作价时，提出了不正确的口号，如有的提出：“好牲口欢迎入社，坏牲口社里不要。”因此有些贫困户伙养着的不好的牲口就非出卖不行。在农民大量出卖牲口当中，投机的牲口贩就趁机活跃起来。他们不仅投机赚钱，而且造谣欺骗，煽动农民出卖牲口。另外，部分农业社干部和农民对粮食统购统销政策缺乏正确的认识，也是某些农民不愿饲养牲口的原因之一。
    为了解决这个问题，中共襄垣县委首先组织各乡党组织在新老农业社中结合粮食统购工作，进行关于农业生产合作社的各项政策的教育；并召开全县五百七十九个新老农业社的社长、会计会议，研究保护耕畜的办法，提高了社干部和社员的思想觉悟。许多社干部在学习政策后检讨了自己在执行政策中的错误。庄里乡农业社社长检讨说：“不要贫困户的牲口，就是忽视依靠贫农的错误做法，今后可要时刻按照阶级路线来进行工作。”长隆乡农业社社长郝大久说：“检查起来，我前后做过两件糟糕事。建社时我只怕大家不愿入社，就向大家说：入了社什么都不用自己发愁啦……结果，有的户入社前就把牲口卖了。社建成后，我又对社员说：凡有牲口的户都得入到社里，牲口作价的钱借给社里，五年还清。社员申广贞（中农）怕牲口入社后得不到现钱，没过两天就把牲口卖了。这两件事情全是我没有执行好政策的后果；以后做工作可得首先学习好政策才行。”在对社员进行教育过程中，批判了那种“先卖车马后入社”的思想。九庄星光农业社社员李贵林说：“这次学习后，我心里更亮了。农业社是大家出力大家富裕，卖了牲口光依靠社是不对的；我的好骡不卖了。”经过教育以后，这个社六户有牲口的社员不卖牲口了，并自动报出了七石五斗牲口料，社里还增买了三头母畜，准备为农林牧业全面发展打根基。
    为了消除某些农民对粮食统购统销政策的思想疑虑，县委领导同志还深入基点，推动全县分片进行了关于粮食统购统销政策的宣传教育。五阳乡南沟村农业社许多社员打消顾虑后，不但不喊牲口没料吃，而且又多卖了不少余粮。
    县领导机关还召开了农业社饲养员代表会议，交流了饲养经验。饲养员李富小介绍了他们社饲养和保护牲口的经验：喂牲口要做到定时、定量，使牲口也要定时、定量；饲养员和使用人订立合同，互相交代牲口的情况。会上还介绍了牲口分槽喂养和要经常保持草料、畜体、畜圈清洁的经验。会议对某些不负责的饲养员把肥牲口喂瘦了的错误行为，进行了批评。
    和这同时，县供销合作社也根据县委的指示，加强了对牲口市场的管理，达到市场平稳，价钱公平，并取缔了那些投机欺骗的牲口贩。
    采取了以上各项措施以后，襄垣很快就停止了农民大量出卖牲口的现象。据今年一月十四日统计，全县有三百九十六个农业社原来计划出卖四百五十五头牲口，现在除一部分可以卖的老牲口外，好牲口一头也不卖了。还有许多农业社向牲口多的地方买回了牲口，根据四百二十七个农业社的统计，近来买回了牲口一百六十九头，用坏牲口换好牲口三百多头。
