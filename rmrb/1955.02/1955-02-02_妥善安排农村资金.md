    Properly Arrange Rural Funds
    Yang Peixin
    In recent years, on the basis of the continuous development of agricultural and sideline production, especially after the implementation of the unified purchase of grain, cotton, and oil crops, not only has the income of farmers increased, but also their monetary income has become concentrated due to the concentrated sales of agricultural products within a short period. In general grain-producing areas, such as Gucheng Township in Pixian County, Sichuan Province, with a population of 10,000, the income from selling grain in winter reached 1 billion yuan. In cotton-producing areas, such as Zhuangli Village in Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, the total income of the village in 1953 was 420,846,500 yuan. After deducting the necessary expenses after selling cotton (including repaying loans, buying grain, and clothing), there was still a surplus of 230,122,365 yuan. Averaged per household, this is more than 1,465,000 yuan; calculated per person, it is 331,009 yuan.
    The increase in farmers' monetary income, and their possession of a certain amount of savings and seasonal surplus funds, is a good thing, which was impossible in the old society. However, with this change in the rural financial situation, our work also needs to go a step further, which is not only to help farmers increase their income, but also to make correct arrangements for the outlets of farmers' funds. Otherwise, it is very likely to cause dissatisfaction among farmers, or lead to excessive eating and drinking, impacting the market, which is not conducive to the consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance and the development of agricultural production.
    Properly arranging rural funds means, on the one hand, striving to do a good job in the supply of materials, so that farmers can buy the necessary means of production and means of livelihood as much as possible; on the other hand, it means carrying out fund adjustment work in rural areas to help farmers accumulate production funds.
    Doing a good job in the supply of rural materials, so that farmers can buy the means of production and means of livelihood they need as much as possible, is an important measure to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance economically and encourage farmers to further develop agriculture and sideline production. However, there are many shortcomings in the current rural material supply work. The main problems are that many materials are out of stock and the supply work is chaotic. Of course, there are some objective reasons, such as insufficient production of certain materials. But this is not the main reason. The main reason is that the guiding ideology of the state-owned commercial and cooperative commercial systems in some regions cannot keep up with the changes in the objective situation, and there is serious bureaucracy. For example, regarding materials such as edible oil, cloth, and sugar, some people believe that since supply cannot meet demand, they can keep more and sell less. Therefore, layers of "contingency amounts" are retained, thickening inventories, intentionally or unintentionally reducing sales, which affects people's lives. In addition, complicated supply procedures and mechanical supply methods also add many difficulties for consumers. Insufficient arrangements and consideration for rural private merchants mean that the existing commercial network cannot meet the needs of the masses and expand the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. In Hong'an County, Hubei Province, the edible oil supply target allocated to the Seventh District was 3.6 taels per person per month, but the district retained 1 tael, leaving 2.6 taels for the township, and the township retained another 1 tael, leaving only 1.6 taels for the masses. In Shaanxi Province, the state-owned commercial administrative departments were slow to issue cotton wadding supply plans. When the weather turned cold and the masses urgently needed cotton, they could not buy it. These are all artificially contributing to or creating a tense situation where the supply of certain commodities cannot meet the demand and some stagnation in the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. This situation not only affects the smooth progress of the unified purchase and acquisition of agricultural products, but also affects the relationship between the Party and the government and the masses of farmers. This should be quickly corrected.
    Organizing savings is another important method to help farmers make reasonable use of surplus funds. At present, many farmers have not developed the habit of saving. Some farmers squander the money they have earned from a year of hard work. A farmer in Gaomi County, Shandong Province, sold surplus grain and obtained 2 million yuan, all of which was used to marry a dead woman to his dead son. After cotton farmers in Xieyu County, Shanxi Province, sold cotton, the Fan Lao Han family bought three bicycles; some cadres who owed agricultural loans of 4 million yuan did not repay them, but bought bicycles; some farmers ate and drank extravagantly. In some places, farmers even listened to rumors spread by unscrupulous merchants and rushed to buy sweet potatoes, coarse cloth, and salt. This behavior not only caused losses to the farmers themselves, but also brought bad effects to the market. The result of doing so will inevitably cause difficulties in spring plowing and production. For farmers, saving can help them accumulate spring plowing production funds, plan their lives in a planned way, and guard against other temporary needs. The state bank and credit cooperatives can also use this money to support the development of mutual aid and cooperation in agricultural production, solve the financial difficulties of farmers, or use it for the state's socialist industrialization. The view that the money saved by farmers is small, the time is short, and it is of no use is wrong. The state's socialist industrialization needs to accumulate a large amount of funds in urban and rural areas. Farmers with a population of 500 million have the strength to support the country's socialist industrialization not only from production but also from funds. No matter how much or how little the number of farmers who save and purchase national bonds in the state bank or credit cooperatives, no matter how long or short the deposit period is, it is a contribution to the country.
    Leading farmers to carry out fund adjustment is also very important work. In addition to holding preferential savings for grain and cotton sales in winter and general savings through the state bank and credit cooperatives, agricultural loans due should also be recovered and national bond payments should be collected, so that the farmers' funds can be accumulated. In spring and summer, the difficulties of agricultural production funds can be solved by repaying savings and issuing agricultural loans. In the winter of 1953, thanks to the Party and government's leadership in educating farmers, they repaid 4.3 trillion yuan of agricultural loans from the state bank and saved 4 trillion yuan, helping the country to recover 8.3 trillion yuan, which was not only conducive to the stability of the winter market, but also conducive to solving the financial difficulties of spring plowing and production, so that in the spring of 1954, the state bank was able to rely on the funds it had recovered and increase new funds, issuing 3.7 trillion yuan of agricultural loans, repaying 3.4 trillion yuan of rural savings, and paying 2.9 trillion yuan of deposits through state-owned commercial advance purchases, totaling more than 10 trillion yuan, supporting spring plowing production. However, in organizing rural savings or promoting national bonds, it is necessary to strictly prevent subjectivism and coercive orders. When people's banks in various parts of Shaanxi Province helped supply and marketing cooperatives pay for cotton sales, they rigidly stipulated the ratio of cotton sales payments to savings. In the seventh and eighth districts of Heyang County, it was stipulated that 50% of the cotton sales payments must be saved, and some places even adopted the method of "no savings, no payment" to mobilize savings, which should be corrected.
    Effectively arranging farmers' means of production and means of livelihood supply and capital adjustment work is a work that party and government at all levels must attach importance to and lead well. In 1954, 13 areas including Kangsai Township in Xingyang County, Yutai Township in Dengfeng County, and Xuedian Township in Jia County, Henan Province, because the local party and government had a good understanding of the monetary income of local farmers and unified the arrangements for material supply and capital adjustment, and then launched publicity among farmers, implemented education on increasing production and practicing economy, and used the experience of local farmers to enlighten farmers, which had great results. For example, Liu Xiaohai, a villager in Budaoli Village in the suburbs of Zhengzhou City, deposited 1 million yuan twice from selling grain, which enabled him to buy more fertilizer, increase summer harvest by 20%, and increase autumn harvest by 20 jin per mu. After this case was publicized, 56 households recognized more than 10 million yuan in savings at that time. Yutai Township in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, called on people to use the grain money earned from a year of labor in the most useful places, prevent extravagant eating and drinking and waste, and rush to buy materials. The township's grain sales income was 96 million yuan. As a result, 15.2 million yuan of agricultural loans were repaid, 66 million yuan was saved, and 4 million yuan was paid for shares and national bonds. The rest was used to purchase means of production and means of livelihood.
    At present, properly handling rural funds not only has economic significance, but also has political significance. If we do not attach importance to and lead the work of material supply and capital adjustment in rural areas, it will promote waste and speculation in rural areas, promote the development of usury, and promote the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of small-scale peasant economy. Therefore, we must attach importance to and learn to master and arrange the financial problems in rural areas, do a good job in material supply and capital adjustment, in order to further develop agricultural production, improve farmers' lives in a planned way, and benefit the further consolidation of the worker-peasant alliance and the implementation of the policy of mutual assistance between urban and rural areas.

    妥善安排农村资金
    杨培新
    最近几年来，在农业和副业生产不断发展的基础上，特别是在粮食、棉花、油料实行统购以后，不仅农民的收入增加了，而且由于他们集中在短时间内出售农产品，农民的货币收入也集中了。一般粮产区，如四川省郫县古城乡，全乡人口一万人，冬季售粮收入达十亿元。棉产区如山西省翼城庄里村，一九五三年全村总收入四亿二千零八十四万六千五百元，如果扣除卖棉后必要的开支（包括归还贷款、买粮、穿布等），还有二亿三千零一十二万二千三百六十五元的闲散资金，如果按户平均，每户是一百四十六万五千余元；按人计算，每人是三十三万一千零九元。
    农民货币收入增加，拥有一定数量的积蓄和季节性的余资，这是一件好事，是在旧社会不可能有的。但是随着农村资金情况的这种变化，也需要我们的工作更深入一步，这就是不只帮助农民增加收入，还要为农民的资金出路作正确的安排。否则就很有可能造成农民的不满，或大吃大喝、冲击市场，不利于工农联盟的巩固和农业生产的发展。
    妥善安排农村资金，一方面是要努力作好物资供应工作，让农民尽可能买到需要的生产资料和生活资料；另一方面，是要在农村开展资金的调剂工作，帮助农民积累生产资金。
    作好农村物资供应工作，让农民尽可能买到所需要的生产资料和生活资料，这是从经济上巩固工农联盟、鼓励农民进一步发展农业、副业生产的积极性的重要措施。但是，目前的农村物资供应工作存在很多缺点。主要是很多物资脱销和供应工作混乱。当然，其中有些客观原因，如某些物资生产不足等。但这不是主要的，主要是有些地区国营商业、合作社商业系统的领导思想赶不上客观形势的变化，存在着严重的官僚主义，如对食油、布、糖等物资，有人认为既然供不应求，就可以多留少卖，于是层层留机动量，增厚存底，有意无意地减少推销，影响了人民的生活；又如供应手续繁杂，供应方法机械，也增加了消费者不少困难；对农村私商安排、照顾不周，现有的商业网不能适应群众需要和扩大城乡物资交流。湖北省红安县分配给七区的食油供应指标是每人每月三两六钱，区里扣一两，分到乡是二两六钱，乡里又扣一两，分到群众只一两六钱。陕西省国营商业行政部门迟迟订不出絮棉供应计划，天气冷了，群众迫切需要用棉的时候，买不到棉花。这都是人为地助长或造成了某些商品供不应求的紧张状况和城乡物资交流的某些呆滞现象，这种情况不仅影响了农产品统购和收购工作的顺利进行，并且影响了党和政府同农民群众的关系。这是应该迅速纠正的。
    组织储蓄是帮助农民合理使用多余资金的另一个重要方法。现在不少地方农民还没有养成储蓄的习惯，有些农民把一年辛苦所得的钱乱花出去了。山东省高密县一个农民卖了余粮得款二百万元，全部为死去的儿子娶死媳妇。山西省解虞县棉农出售棉花后，范老汉一家买了三辆自行车，有的干部欠农业贷款四百万元不还，买了自行车；有的农民大吃大喝。有些地方农民甚至听信奸商造谣，抢购地瓜、土布、食盐，这种行为不仅给农民自己造成损失，而且给市场带来不好的影响。这样做的结果，必然造成春耕生产的困难。对农民来说，储蓄可以帮助他积累春耕生产资金，有计划地安排生活，并防备其他临时需要的一种方法。国家银行和信用合作社还可以运用这笔钱，来扶助农业生产互助合作的发展，解决农民弟兄的资金困难，或用于国家的社会主义工业化的事业。那种认为农民储蓄的钱少、时间短、顶不了事的观点是错误的。国家的社会主义工业化需要在城市和农村积聚大量的资金，数达五亿人口的农民是有力量不仅从生产上而且从资金上支持国家的社会主义工业化的。农民在国家银行或信用合作社储蓄和认购国家公债数字不论多少，存期不论长短，对于国家都是有贡献的。
    领导农民开展资金调剂，也是很重要的工作。除了通过国家银行和信用合作社，冬天举办售粮售棉优待储蓄、一般的储蓄以外，还应收回到期的农贷、催收公债款项，把农民的资金积蓄起来。到了春天和夏天则以偿还储蓄、发放农贷等方式，解决农业生产资金的困难。一九五三年冬季，由于党和政府领导教育农民，偿还国家银行农贷四万三千亿元，储蓄四万亿元，帮助国家回笼货币八万三千亿元，不仅有利于冬季市场的稳定，并且有利于解决春耕生产的资金困难，使一九五四年春天，国家银行能够依靠已回笼的资金并增加新的资金，发放了农贷三万七千亿元，偿还农村储蓄三万四千亿元，通过国营商业预购支付的定金二万九千亿元，共投放了十万多亿元，支持了春耕生产。但在举办农村储蓄或推销国家公债中要严防主观主义和强迫命令作风。陕西省各地人民银行在帮助供销合作社代付售棉款时，硬性规定售棉款和储蓄的比例，郃阳县七、八两区规定必须储蓄售棉款的百分之五十，有的地方甚至采用“不储蓄、不付款”的办法来动员储蓄，这都是应该纠正的。
    有效地安排农民的生产资料和生活资料供应工作以及资金调剂工作，是各级党、政必须重视和领导做好的工作。一九五四年河南省荥阳县康塞乡、登封县玉台乡、郏县薛店乡等十三个地区，由于当地党、政对本地农民货币收入心中有数，统一安排了物资供应和资金调剂工作，然后在农民中展开宣传，贯彻增产节约的教育，运用当地农民的经验来启发农民，收到很大的效果。又如郑州市郊区布袋里村刘小孩两次售粮存款一百万元，使他能够增买肥料，使夏收增产二成，秋收每亩增产二十斤，这次他又存八十万元。这一事例一经宣传，当时便有五十六户认储一千余万元。河南省登封县玉台乡号召把一年劳动所得的粮款用到最有用的地方，防止大吃大喝浪费、抢购物资，该乡售粮收入九千六百万元，结果归还农贷一千五百二十万元，储蓄六千六百万元，缴股金、公债款四百万元，其余用于购买生产资料、生活资料等。
    当前妥善处理农村资金不仅具有经济的意义，而且具有政治的意义。如果我们不重视并领导农村的物资供应和资金调剂工作，将会助长农村中的浪费和投机现象，助长高利贷的发展，助长小农经济的自发的资本主义倾向。因此我们必须重视并学会掌握和安排农村的资金问题，做好物资供应和资金调剂工作，以利于进一步发展农业生产，有计划地改善农民生活，并利于工农联盟的进一步巩固和城乡互助政策的贯彻。
