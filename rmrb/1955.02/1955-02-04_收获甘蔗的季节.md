    The Season for Harvesting Sugarcane
    Tian Yuzhe, Cao Erqi

    In mid-January, in the villages along both banks of the Mulan River in Xianyou County, Fujian Province, which are rich in sugarcane production, groups of three to five farmers were cutting the thick sugarcane in the dense sugarcane fields; on the roads leading to the sugar factory, horse-drawn carts and rickshaws transporting sugarcane were coming and going in an endless stream. In more than one hundred sugarcane-producing villages throughout the county, the joyful atmosphere of the harvest season was everywhere.

    Last year, Xianyou suffered a severe drought, but thanks to the Communist Party and the People's Government leading the farmers to resolutely carry out the struggle against the drought, mobilizing sugarcane farmers to improve farming techniques, and allocating more than 800 million yuan in loans to support sugarcane farmers in expanding production, the vast majority of the county's more than 63,000 mu of sugarcane saw increased production. The total output of cane sugar in the county this year is expected to increase by 30,000 dan compared to last year. In particular, mutual aid and cooperation organizations have achieved even better harvests of cane sugar this year. In Daji Township, District 6, we visited the Siming Village Agricultural Production Cooperative. The director of the cooperative, Lin Caiying, a young woman, pointed to the sugarcane fields in the field and said, "Go and see in the fields; whichever sugarcane is thicker and taller than the surrounding sugarcane, that field belongs to our cooperative." She also told us a story: Lin Jinbang, a member of the cooperative, had a mu of land more than two li away from his home. In the past, his family lacked labor and fertilizer, and the sugarcane harvest was very poor. Last year, Lin Jinbang joined the cooperative, and the cooperative planted sugarcane in his field. Thanks to the cooperative's hard work and sufficient fertilizer, this mu of sugarcane yielded eighteen dan of sugar liquid, an increase of 80% compared to previous years. The Siming Village Agricultural Production Cooperative planted 36 mu of sugarcane, yielding 17 dan of sugar liquid per mu, an increase of 3 dan compared to last year.

    In Shima, an area prone to drought nine years out of ten, we also saw a scene of abundant sugarcane harvest. After the state established a pumping station in Shima last year, the face of this area has undergone fundamental changes. The 1,800 mu of sugarcane irrigated by the pumping station generally increased production by 15% compared to last year.

    The abundant sugarcane harvest has brought an even more prosperous scene to various market towns. In the county's ten supply and marketing cooperatives entrusted by the state to purchase sugar, farmers are crowding every day to sell sugar to the state. From January 10th to 14th, the average daily market volume in the county was more than 3,000 dan of cane sugar. Every day, more than a dozen trucks sped back and forth on the roads, transporting new sugar in batches for external transfer to meet the needs of the people inside and outside the province.

    收获甘蔗的季节
    田毓泽　曹尔奇
    一月中旬，在福建仙游县木兰溪两岸盛产甘蔗的乡村里，三、五成群的农民正在茂密的蔗林里砍伐着粗壮的甘蔗；通往糖厂的公路上，运蔗的马车、人力车，络绎不绝。全县一百多个产蔗乡，到处散发着丰收季节的欢乐气息。
    去年，仙游遭受了严重的旱灾，但由于共产党和人民政府领导农民坚决开展抗旱斗争，发动蔗农改进耕作技术，并拨出八亿多万元贷款，扶持蔗农扩大生产，因此，全县六万三千多亩甘蔗，绝大部分获得增产，全县今年蔗糖的总产量预计可比去年增加三万担。特别是互助合作组织，今年蔗糖都获得更好的收成。在六区大济乡，我们访问了四明村农业生产合作社。社长林彩英是个年轻的妇女，她指着田野里成片的甘蔗林说：“你们到田里去看看，哪一丘甘蔗长得比周围的甘蔗粗壮、高大，哪一丘的田就是我们合作社的。”她还告诉我们这样一个故事：社员林金榜，有一亩离家两里多路的田地，过去他家劳力缺乏、肥料不足，种植甘蔗的收成很坏。去年林金榜入了社，社里就在他那丘田种植甘蔗。由于社里的功勤肥足，结果这亩甘蔗收了十八担糖清，比往年增产八成。四明村农业生产合作社种植三十六亩甘蔗，每亩可收十七担糖清，比去年多收三担。
    在十年九旱的石马一带，我们一样看到甘蔗丰收的景象。去年国家在石马建立了抽水机站以后，这带的面貌发生了根本改变。受抽水机站灌溉的一千八百亩甘蔗，普遍比去年增产一成半。
    甘蔗丰收给各个集镇带来了更加繁荣的景象。全县十个受国家委托收购食糖的供销合作社里，天天拥挤着卖食糖给国家的农民，全县一月十日至十四日，每天平均上市量有三千多担蔗糖，每天都有十几辆汽车在公路上往返疾驶，把新糖成批往外调运，供应省内外人民的需要。
