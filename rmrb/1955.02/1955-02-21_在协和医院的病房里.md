    In the Wards of Peking Union Medical College Hospital
    Cai Jianyuan
    The signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons has unfolded, penetrating into government agencies, schools, factories, and the countryside. Every peace-loving person has enthusiastically signed their name.
    Here, in the internal medicine ward of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, nurse Zhao Yu enthusiastically introduced the patients' signing situation to me.
    In the morning, after the duty nurse told the patients about the signing, shouts of "I'll sign, I'll sign!" and "Me too!" rang out. Luo Yulin, suffering from hepato-splenomegaly, was the most eager, signing his name first. Gao Yinbao, whose son is in the Navy of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said while signing: "Of course I'll sign for such a good thing." Liu Yongfa, a patient with lymphadenopathy, signed his name, and when his wife came to visit him, she also signed. Out of the ward's thirty patients, all signed except for four who were comatose.
    In the thoracic surgery and general surgery wards, convalescents were holding a discussion. The duty nurse Wang Fangzhi, holding a notebook, was relaying what she had heard about atomic energy and atomic weapons in a lecture. She said excitedly: "The atomic energy of a piece of uranium the size of a cigarette pack is equivalent to the heat generated by two or three trains of coal. You can imagine how beneficial the use of atomic energy can be. Therefore, we advocate the peaceful use of atomic energy." Then, she read the "Appeal to the People of the World" aloud to the convalescents.
    The convalescents spoke. Wang Juchang, a convalescent with a peptic ulcer from a certain unit of the Xinjiang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said: The signature campaign is a force. We must raise our hammer-like hands to show the American imperialists. Zheng Guilian, the station chief of an anti-aircraft station of a certain anti-aircraft unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, a convalescent suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis, calmly spoke about how the Soviet Union is using atomic energy for peaceful purposes. Finally, he said powerfully: "I will strive to recover my health as soon as possible and support the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons with practical actions at my job." Several other convalescents also expressed their understanding of the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons.
    After the discussion, the convalescents who could move freely quickly signed their names. The convalescents who were lying down and could not move easily had their names signed by their convalescent class leader.
    A moving scene began: Ye Ruiyuan, who was undergoing gastric juice extraction, struggled to sign his name; Kong Zhaoguang, who was hemiplegic, also struggled to sign his name; Chen Dequan, who suffered from empyema, could not move and asked the class leader to sign for him. How determined they were! Abudulayouf, a Uyghur, was not present at the discussion earlier. But when he learned that the signatures were being collected to oppose the use of atomic weapons, he waved and came over, signing his name in Uyghur. Jin Guangshi, who is Korean, signed his name in Korean. Lama Wangqigserang, a Mongolian convalescent, is suffering from esophageal cancer. He does not understand Chinese or Mandarin. The duty nurse asked a comrade from the hospital's radiology department who understood Mongolian to translate for him, and he also signed his name.
    A total of thirty-eight convalescents all signed their names.
    When I arrived at the obstetrics and gynecology ward, the duty nurse, hearing me ask about the signing, picked up a piece of paper and said to me: "Look, the mothers' signatures." As she spoke, she led me to a hospital bed and introduced: "This is Xu Xibao, the first to sign. It's her first time giving birth, but she had twins, so she's a mother of two children now." Xu Xibao sat up, her face a little red, and said: "I am really happy to be able to sign here to oppose the use of atomic weapons." She raised her head and added: "I want peace, and my children need peace even more. I signed my name, I should say I signed for my children."
    The duty nurse introduced me to another lying-in woman, Chang Kai, who is already the mother of five children. She said that she listened to the conference report through headphones the night before and was prepared to sign the next day. She quickly signed when the signing started in the ward. "Everyone is willing to sign to oppose the use of atomic weapons. The world needs peace, China needs peace, and I and my five children need peace. Not only do I want to sign to oppose the use of atomic weapons, but if possible, I want to sign on behalf of my five children." After a pause, she added: "Oh, actually my eldest child can sign his own name. The children's hatred for American imperialism is so strong, maybe he has already signed before me."
    Leaving the ward, the duty nurse pointed to the two particularly large characters "Luo Gu" on the signature list and said to me, "This is a woman in labor who just had saline injected into her right hand. She is thirty-five years old and pregnant for the first time. She was already very nervous when everyone was signing just now, and she still requested to participate in the signing, and finally she signed her name with her left hand." She calculated with her fingers and continued to point to the signature list and say: "Look, these are two mothers who cannot write, and they asked someone to sign on their behalf. A total of twenty-five mothers in the obstetrics and gynecology ward, except for one who is currently giving birth and has not yet signed, have all signed. Everyone's morale is so high. As soon as they heard that they were signing to oppose the use of atomic weapons, many people were prepared. The mothers' love for peace can be seen clearly."
    Peace, it is the most consistent desire in people's hearts. The desire for peace will give people unparalleled strength.

    在协和医院的病房里
    蔡鉴远
    反对使用原子武器的签名运动展开了，它深入到机关、学校、工厂、农村，每一个爱好和平的人都踊跃地签了名。
    这里，是中国协和医学院附属医院的内科病房，护士赵玉热情地向我介绍病人们签名的情形。
    早上当值班护士向病人们讲了关于签名的事以后，就“我签，我签”，“我也签”，响起了一片喊声。患肝脾肿大的骆玉麟最急，他抢先第一个签了名。儿子在中国人民解放军海军某部的高银宝在签名时说：“这么好的事，我当然签名。”患淋巴腺肿大的病人刘永发签了名，他爱人来探望他，也一起签了名。全病房三十个病人，除了四个昏迷的，全签了名。
    在胸外科和基本外科病房，休养员们正在开座谈会。值班护士汪芳芝拿着笔记本在传达她所听到的关于原子能和原子武器的讲演。她激动地说：“纸烟盒大的一块铀的原子能，等于两三列火车的煤产生的热。可想见原子能的利用有多大好处。所以我们主张和平利用原子能。”接着，她把“告全世界人民书”大声地念给休养员们听。
    休养员们发言了。患胃溃疡的王聚昌，是中国人民解放军新疆军区某部的休养员，他说：签名运动是一种力量，我们要举起像铁锤一样的手给美帝国主义看看。中国人民解放军防空部队某防空站站长郑贵连，是患肺结核的休养员，他沉着地说起了苏联如何把原子能用于和平事业的情况，最后他有力地说：“我要争取早恢复健康，到工作岗位上用实际行动支持反对使用原子武器的签名运动。”还有好几个休养员发表了各自对反对使用原子武器的签名运动的认识。
    座谈以后，能自由行动的休养员们很快地签了名。躺着不能随便行动的休养员，由他们的休养班长一一把纸送到床上去签。
    一个动人的场面开始了：正在进行抽胃液的叶瑞元，挣扎着签了名；半身不遂的孔霅光，也挣扎着签了名；患脓胸的陈德全，不能动，请班长代签了名。他们是多么坚决啊！刚才开座谈会时，维吾尔族的阿不都拉尤夫不在。但他知道是在为反对使用原子武器而进行签名，他一面招手一面走来了，他用维吾尔文签了名。金光石，是朝鲜族，他用朝鲜文签了名。蒙族休养员喇嘛旺其格色梁，正患食道癌。他不懂汉文，也不懂汉语，值班护士请院里放射科一位懂蒙语的同志为他翻译后，他也签了名。
    他们共三十八个休养员，全签了名。
    到了妇产科病房，值班护士听我问签名的事，她拿起一张纸头朝着我说：“喏，妈妈们的签名。”她一面说一面领我走向一张病床，并介绍说：“这就是第一个签名的许锡宝，她是第一次生孩子，可是一生就是一对，所以她是两个孩子的妈妈了。”许锡宝坐起来，面孔显得有点红，她说：“我真高兴，能在这里签名反对使用原子武器。”她扬了扬头，又说：“我要和平，孩子更要和平。我签了名，应该说我为孩子们签了名。”
    值班护士为我介绍了另一位产妇常凯，她已经是五个孩子的妈妈了。她说她头天晚上用耳机收听了大会的报告，准备第二天签名的，病房里开始签名时她很快就签了。“为反对使用原子武器而签名，谁都愿意。世界需要和平，中国需要和平，我和我的五个孩子需要和平。不仅我要签名反对使用原子武器，如果可以的话，我要代我的五个孩子都签名。”停了一下，她又说：“哦，其实我的大孩子他自己会签名了。孩子恨美帝国主义的心情是那样强烈，也许他已经在我先签了。”
    出了病房，值班护士指着签名单上两个写得特别大的字“罗嘏”对我说，“这是一位右手刚注射了盐水的临产妇，她三十五岁，第一次怀孕，刚才大家签名时她已经很紧张了，她还要求参加签名，终于她用左手签了名。”她用手指计算了一下，继续指着签名单说：“你看，这是两位不会写字的妈妈，她们请人代签了名。妇产科病房共二十五位妈妈，除了一位正在生产的暂时没签名以外，全都签了名。大家情绪可高，一听说要为反对使用原子武器签名了，许多人就准备着。妈妈们热爱和平的心情，可以看得清清楚楚。”
    和平，它就是人们心底最最一致的愿望。和平的愿望，它将给予人们无比的力量。
