To the Editor: The Geological Department's Exploration Team 205 recently organized a working group to conduct a financial inventory of five drilling rigs and found that some teams had very poor care for fixed assets.

	At the No. 304 rig site, many pieces of equipment were scattered haphazardly outside the workshop in the open air, and the diesel engine cover was not covered, allowing wind and snow to erode it; a new tent was damaged, and new iron frames were taken to be used as pigpens. At the No. 505 and No. 502 rig sites, long rubber boots worn in the summer were still thrown in the snow. At the No. 507 rig site, core boxes, drill pipes, and drilling tools were also scattered randomly. Only the No. 306 rig had a better situation, with all equipment placed in the warehouse according to regulations.

	A more serious situation is that there is a widespread waste phenomenon in the use of drill pipe joints at various rigs. Now the repair shop is piled with many drill pipe joints, one end of the screw thread is worn thin, while the other end of the screw thread is still new. The material staff and the rig captains of each rig do not pay enough attention to the issues of saving raw materials and reducing costs.

	This situation shows that strengthening the education of field exploration teams on cherishing state property and making economic accounting a mass-based work is still a noteworthy issue.

### 野外勘察队也要注意爱护国家财产

    野外勘察队也要注意爱护国家财产编辑同志：地质部二○五勘探队最近组织工作组分赴五个钻机进行财务清点工作，发现有些队对固定资产的爱护很差。
    在三○四机台现场，很多器材横七竖八地乱放在场房外面露天里，柴油机的盖子也不盖，任凭风雪侵蚀；新帐篷搞坏了，新的铁架被拿去当猪圈。在五○五、五○二机台现场，夏天穿过的长统胶皮鞋还扔在雪地里。在五○七机台现场，岩芯箱、钻杆、钻具同样是乱放着。只有三○六机台情况较好，一切器材都按规定放在仓房里。
    更严重的情形是：各个机台在使用钻杆接头时，普遍有浪费现象。现在修配间堆着很多钻杆接头，一头螺丝扣磨薄了，而另一头螺丝扣还是新的。材料员和各机台机长对于节省原材料、降低成本的问题也不够重视。
    这个情况说明，加强对野外勘察队的爱护国家资财的教育，使经济核算成为群众性的工作，还是一个值得重视的问题。
