    China Aided the Korean People with a Large Amount of Construction Materials Last Year
   [Our Newspaper] The foreign trade system and relevant departments of our country victoriously completed the task assigned by the state to aid the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with materials for peaceful construction last year. The aid materials included more than 6,000 items, including large quantities of coal, cloth, cotton, building materials, transportation equipment, chemical and pharmaceutical goods, metal products, machinery, agricultural implements, paper and stationery, and other necessities of life for the people.
    The workers and staff of relevant industrial and mining enterprises in various places regarded supporting the peaceful construction of the Korean people as a glorious task. Workers at the Shenyang Water Pump Factory and the Shanghai Electric Welding Factory, etc., in order to support the Korean people in irrigating terraced fields in a timely manner, produced more than 300 water pumps ahead of schedule. After receiving the task of manufacturing a brick-making machine capable of producing 5,000 bricks per hour for the Korean people, the workers of the Beijing People's Machinery Factory brought into play the spirit of internationalism, actively studied and created, and manufactured a brick-making machine capable of producing 9,000 to 10,000 bricks per hour. When packaging the concrete mixing machine, the workers of this factory not only used wooden boards to pack it firmly, but also added a cross-shaped wooden frame on the outside and tied it tightly with thick iron wire. They said: These things are going to Korea to participate in peaceful construction, and we must not allow them to be damaged on the road! Workers in Shanghai and other places also produced many new products for the Korean people. The employees of the China Sundries Export Company system, who are responsible for organizing and transporting these materials, not only tried to transport these materials to Korea as soon as possible, but also studied with the production departments to reduce product costs and find ways to reduce various expenses. Last year, the China Sundries Export Company headquarters alone saved more than 18.23 billion yuan for the Korean people, according to incomplete statistics, from the materials it shipped.

    我国去年援助朝鲜人民大批建设物资
   【本报讯】我国对外贸易系统和各有关部门，去年胜利完成了国家给予的援助朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和平建设物资的任务。援助物资有六千多种，包括大批煤炭、布匹、棉花、建筑器材、交通器材、化工医药物品、金属制品、机器、农具、纸张文具和其他的人民生活必需品。
    各地有关工矿企业的职工都把支援朝鲜人民的和平建设作为光荣任务。沈阳水泵厂和上海电焊厂等的工人为了支持朝鲜人民及时灌溉梯田，提前制成了三百多台水泵。北京人民机器厂工人接到为朝鲜人民制造每小时产砖五千块的制砖机的任务以后，发挥国际主义精神，积极钻研创造，制成了每小时生产九千块到一万块砖的制砖机。这个厂的工人在包装混凝土拌合机的时候，除用木板包装牢靠以外，又在外面加上十字木架，用粗铁丝捆紧。他们说：这些东西是要到朝鲜参加和平建设的，不能让它们在路上受到一点损坏！上海等地的工人还为朝鲜人民生产了许多新产品。负责组织和调运这些物资的中国杂品出口公司系统的职工们，不仅设法尽快地把这些物资运到朝鲜去，还同生产部门研究降低产品成本，设法减少各种费用。去年仅中国杂品出口公司总公司发运的物资，据不完全统计，就为朝鲜人民节省费用一百八十二亿三千多万元。
