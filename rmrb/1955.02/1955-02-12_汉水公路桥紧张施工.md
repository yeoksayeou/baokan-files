The construction of the Han River Highway Bridge has entered the full-scale construction phase in February. The bridge builders have devised various methods to ensure that the bridge piers are built out of the water during the dry season. Since the start of underwater work at the end of last year, the entire piling work of Pier No. 3 and the straight piling work of Pier No. 4 have been completed. The inclined pile frame on Pier No. 3 has been moved to Pier No. 4. The mud suction work also started on February 2nd. The concrete factory has been pouring concrete on the abutment and piers on the Hankou bank. The universal pile driver has driven more than ten pipe piles on Pier No. 5.

In order to successfully complete the bottom sealing task, the leaders of the engineering section will transfer a group of technical personnel and political workers to the pile driving and installation working area to assist in the work; Soviet experts have gone to Pier No. 3 several times to solve the preparatory work for mud suction and bottom sealing; the pile driving and installation working area is actively organizing workers to conduct technical learning of bottom sealing; the workers of the electromechanical working area are rushing to assemble the bottom sealing pipelines.

On Piers No. 3, 4, and 5, the workers are enthusiastically launching labor competitions between the piers. Six of the nine work teams have broken the competition targets. The Liu Deqing work team has repeatedly created new piling records and won the rotating red flag of competition winners. The working area is now conducting evaluation and awards, and will deepen the competition further.

    汉水公路桥紧张施工
    汉水公路桥的建设工程，二月份已进入全面施工阶段。修桥的人们想了各种办法，保证在枯水期中把桥墩修出水面。自去年年底水下工程开工以来，到现在已经完成了三号墩的全部打桩工程和四号墩的打直桩工程，三号墩上的斜桩架已经移到四号墩。吸泥工作也在二月二日开始了。混凝土工厂已经在汉口岸的桥台和桥墩上浇灌混凝土。万能打桩机已经在五号墩上打下十多根管桩。
    为了胜利完成封底任务，工程段领导上将调一批技术人员和政治工作人员到打桩安装工区协助工作；苏联专家曾几次到三号墩上去解决吸泥和封底的准备工作；打桩安装工区正积极组织工人进行封底的技术学习；机电工区的工人们正赶紧拼接封底的管道。
    三、四、五号桥墩上，工人们热烈的展开了墩与墩之间的劳动竞赛，九个工班中已有六个工班突破了竞赛指标。刘德卿工班连续几次创造了打桩新纪录，获得了竞赛优胜循环红旗。现在工区正进行评比和给奖，并将把竞赛深入一步。
