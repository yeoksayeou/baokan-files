    Such Savings
    Liu Chuanxun
    In some areas of Henan Province, during the unified purchase of grain, cotton, and oil-bearing crops, banks, credit cooperatives, and district/township cadres neglected the work of propaganda and education for farmers, forcing the masses to save and buy shares, causing dissatisfaction among farmers.
    When the Pan Dou Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Lingbao County was purchasing cotton, they had cotton farmers line up in four queues: one for repaying loans, one for paying savings deposits, one for joining the credit cooperative and paying advance purchase deposits, and one for not paying or repaying anything. The first three queues could sell cotton first, while the last queue would have to wait longer and might not have their cotton purchased. Farmer Li Dongjiao sold 51,000 yuan worth of cotton and urgently needed the money, but the credit cooperative, which was paying on behalf of the supply and marketing cooperative, forced him to save and refused to pay him. Li Dongjiao became angry and tore up all the cotton sales receipts.
    Many cotton farmers, hearing that the credit cooperative was paying on their behalf, picked up their cotton and left, saying, "If I don't sell, I still have cotton; if I sell, I'll end up with nothing." As a result, the amount of cotton purchased decreased. In some purchasing points in Lingbao County, only about ten jin were purchased per day, and sometimes not even one jin was purchased in one or two days.
    Mengjin, Luoyang, Luoning, and other counties stipulated that anyone selling more than ten jin of cotton must save. As a result, farmers who had originally planned to sell large bales of cotton all dispersed the cotton and asked their wives and children to sell it, and sold it in small quantities continuously. The queues of farmers selling cotton in front of the supply and marketing cooperative were very long, and the purchasing cadres were too busy, but the daily purchase volume was very small.
    It is a good thing for banks and credit cooperatives to mobilize farmers to save and buy shares. However, if the method of persuasion and education is not adopted, and if the principle of voluntariness is not adhered to, this good thing will turn into a bad thing, causing losses to the country and the people. As in the areas mentioned above, due to forcing the masses to save and buy shares, not only did it cause dissatisfaction among farmers, but it also prevented some supply and marketing cooperatives from completing their cotton purchase plans; on the other hand, the black market became active at the same time.
    The regulation that anyone selling more than ten jin of cotton must save is unreasonable. Such acts of privately enacting laws should be abolished; otherwise, good things will more easily turn into bad things.

    如此储蓄
    刘传勋
    河南省有些地区在粮食、棉花、油料统购工作中，银行、信用合作社和区乡干部忽视了对农民的宣传教育工作，强迫群众储蓄、入股，引起农民不满。
    灵宝县盘豆乡供销社收购棉花的时候，让棉农排成四队：还贷款的一队，缴储蓄款的一队，入信用合作社和缴预购定金的一队，什么都不缴、不还的一队；前三队可以优先售棉，后一队时间晚些就不收购。农民李东郊卖棉五万一千元，急需用款，代供销合作社付款的信用社却强逼他储蓄，不肯付款。李东郊生气，把卖棉花票全部撕毁。
    许多卖棉花的农民听说信用社代为付款，背起棉花就走，说“不卖有花在，卖了两头空”。因此，棉花收购量下降。灵宝县有的收购点每天只收十斤左右，有时一两天都收不到一斤。
    孟津、洛阳、洛宁等县规定售棉十斤以上的必须储蓄。结果，原来准备大包卖棉的农民，都把棉花分散开来，叫自己的老婆、孩子去卖，并且连续零卖。供销社门前卖棉农民的行列很长，收购干部忙不过来，每日收购量却很少。
    银行和信用社发动农民储蓄、入股，原是一件好事。但是，如果不采用说服教育的方法，如果不坚持自愿的原则，就会把这种好事办成坏事，给国家和人民造成损失。就像上面说的这些地区，由于强制群众储蓄、入股，不仅引起农民的不满，而且使一部分供销社不能完成收购棉花计划；另一方面，黑市却同时活跃起来。
    售棉十斤以上的必须储蓄，这种规定是没有道理的。应该取消这种私自立法的行为，否则，好事更容易变成坏事。
