    Chinese Opera Research Institute
    Compiles Comprehensive Record of Classical Operas and Synopsis of Local Operas
    The Chinese Opera Research Institute has begun compiling a comprehensive record of Chinese classical operas and a synopsis of local operas.

    The "Comprehensive Record of Chinese Classical Operas" currently being compiled mainly includes the works of northern and southern opera artists from the Song, Jin, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, including a complete catalog of classical scripts such as zaju, xiwen, yuanben, and chuanqi. The initial draft of the "Complete Catalog of Yuan Dynasty Zaju," which has been completed, is over 100,000 words long and includes more than 740 zaju works. This is more than double the number of Yuan Dynasty zaju titles listed in Yao Xie's "Jin Le Kao Zheng" from the Qing Dynasty and Wang Guowei's "Qu Lu" from fifty years ago. It also includes three appendices: "Annotations on Referenced Books," "Index of Author Names," and "Index of Zaju Titles." In the next four years, the Opera Research Institute will successively compile complete catalogs of zaju from the Song and Jin dynasties, and zaju and chuanqi from the Ming and Qing dynasties.

    The synopsis of local operas involves transcribing local opera scripts and writing scene-by-scene descriptions. Currently completed synopses include 280 pieces of local operas from Hebei Province, such as Hebei Bangzi, Sixian, Wuan Luozi, Dingxian Yangge, and Huaidiao. This year's plan includes compiling synopses of excellent Sichuan opera plays.

    中国戏曲研究院
    编写古典戏曲总录和地方戏提要
    中国戏曲研究院开始编写中国古典戏曲总录和地方戏提要。
    现正编写的中国古典戏曲总录主要是宋、金、元、明、清五代的南北戏曲家作品，包括杂剧、戏文、院本、传奇等古典剧本的全部目录。现已完成的“元代杂剧全目”初稿约十万多字，共编入七百四十多种杂剧作品，较清代姚燮编的“今乐考证”和五十年前王国维编的“曲录”中所提元代杂剧的书目都增加了一倍多，并附有“引用书籍解题”、“作家名称索引”、“杂剧名目索引”三篇。今后四年中，戏曲研究院将陆续编成宋代、金代的杂剧和明代、清代的杂剧、传奇等全目。
    地方戏提要，是抄录地方戏剧本，写出分场说明书。现已完成的有河北省的河北梆子、丝弦、武安络子、定县秧歌、淮调等地方戏的提要二百八十篇；今年计划编写的有川剧优秀剧目提要。
