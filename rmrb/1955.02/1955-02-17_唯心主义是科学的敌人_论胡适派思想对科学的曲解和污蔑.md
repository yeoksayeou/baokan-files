Idealism is the Enemy of Science
　　——On the Distortion and Slander of Science by the Hu Shih Faction's Ideology
    Hu Sheng
    Hu Shih's pragmatist thought is an extremely anti-scientific subjective idealism. However, Hu Shih and his cohorts boasted that they were supporters of science and promoters of science. In order to use the signboard of science to conceal their true colors, Hu Shih frequently invoked sayings such as "respect facts" and "follow the facts." If people do not understand the essence of Hu Shih's thought, they might think that Hu Shih is perhaps not a thoroughgoing idealist, or that subjective idealist thought does not prevent people from truly studying science and adhering to a scientific attitude. The purpose of Hu Shih and his gang was to confuse the distinction between idealism and materialism, to make science a tool of the idealist worldview, and thus fundamentally undermine science.

    In order to strictly delineate the boundaries between materialism and idealism, to prevent science from being led astray by idealism, and to defend the scientific attitude and scientific methods that can only be established on the basis of a materialist worldview, it is necessary for us to thoroughly expose Hu Shih's deception. We must point out that Hu Shih's so-called "respect for facts" is not true respect for facts, and Hu Shih's so-called "respect for facts" and "promotion of science" are closely linked to his fundamental viewpoint of subjective idealism, and that hidden beneath these words is a thoroughly anti-scientific attitude.

    I

    Why is Hu Shih's so-called "respect for facts" not true respect for facts?

    Because, first, the "facts" that Hu Shih speaks of are at most individual materials and individual phenomena. Hu Shih's so-called "respect for facts" is not for the purpose of understanding the essence and objective laws of objective things, but rather to use individual materials and phenomena to confuse the understanding of essence and laws.

    Moreover, second, the "facts" that Hu Shih speaks of are not objective existences outside of human consciousness. According to the subjective idealist viewpoint of Hu Shih's faction, what people recognize is not objective existence. Their so-called "facts" are merely products of the subjective.

    Both of these points involve epistemological issues in philosophy. Using the epistemology of Marxist philosophy as a weapon, we can thoroughly expose Hu Shih's deception. Let us first talk about the first point here.

    Hu Shih frequently opposed the use of "abstract nouns" in the name of his so-called "respect for facts." From this statement, it can be clearly seen that Hu Shih was using a cunning form to prevent people from revealing the inherent essence and laws of objective things.

    As early as 1919, in his "Problems and -isms," Hu Shih said that his main reason for opposing talking about -isms, especially socialism, was because an -ism is an "abstract noun." He said: "When a proposition becomes an -ism, it changes from a concrete plan into an abstract noun. The weakness and danger of '-ism' lies here" ("Hu Shih's Collected Works," Vol. 2, pp. 149-150). In 1928, he wrote again: "The big problems of the world can never be completely encompassed by one or two abstract nouns (such as 'capitalism,' 'communism,' etc.). The most important thing is facts. Nowadays, many friends only talk about -isms and refuse to look at the facts… Using the word 'red' to obliterate the new movement is Zhang Zuolin and Wu Peifu's trick. But how much more insightful is it to use the word 'capitalism' to obliterate all modern countries?" ("Collected Works," Series 3, pp. 63-64, emphasis in the original).

    There are many more such statements in Hu Shih's articles over the years. In 1935, he simply announced that the use of terms such as feudalism, capitalism, socialism, and communism was "a major malady in today's ideological circles." He said that what he opposed was "using an abstract noun to replace many concrete historical facts," "this problem is general, chaotic, and obliterates facts" ("Independent Review," No. 153).

    According to Hu Shih, he opposed "abstract nouns" because he respected concrete facts; the scientific attitude should be like his, respecting concrete facts.

    Hu Shih used this set of statements to portray abstraction and concreteness as absolutely opposed, making people believe that only individual concrete things are real, while abstract things are illusory and meaningless. This statement is completely wrong.

    Every branch of natural science or social science cannot but use abstract thinking. Scientific abstraction is to find the essential commonalities from many concrete facts and generalize them, deeply revealing the internal connections and internal laws of things. The essence and internal laws of things are not something that people can directly see or touch, but must be grasped through human thinking. Therefore, scientific abstraction, on the one hand, seems to be separated from the concrete things of sensation because it excludes the various non-essential and accidental factors on the external phenomena of things, but on the other hand, it is based on concrete sensory knowledge and reflects objective things more deeply and more truly.

    Therefore, scientific abstraction cannot be opposed. Rejecting scientific abstraction is rejecting rational knowledge, rejecting the understanding of the essence of things and the internal laws of things, and also rejecting science itself.

    What Hu Shih opposed was this kind of scientific abstraction.

    It is certainly correct and necessary to summarize the "modern countries" that Hu Shih eulogized with the concept of "capitalism." Because this concept reveals the essence of things.

    We are now carrying out countless concrete works and concrete struggles to build our country, and summarizing all of this is called socialist construction and transformation, that is, socialist revolution. This concept essentially indicates the content of the work and struggle we are carrying out.

    The terms capitalism, imperialism, feudalism, socialism, etc., which Hu Shih opposed, were increasingly and widely used after Marxism was introduced into China. Marxism uses these terms to express scientific concepts with clear content. These terms were quickly accepted by the broad masses of the people because they are reflections of the essence of historical phenomena. Hu Shih and his ilk tried their best to exclude them but could not.

    Precisely because Hu Shih's purpose is to eliminate scientific knowledge, what he opposes is only scientific abstraction. Since Hu Shih regarded abstract concepts as nothing more than fictitious things, thereby attacking scientific concepts, he completely manipulated concepts arbitrarily according to his own needs and convenience. In Hu Shih's articles, various concepts with uncertain meanings and unclear contents are used in large quantities, and scientific concepts that originally had clear content are deliberately made into vague terms. Here is just one example. In order to oppose socialism, Hu Shih once said: "You, me, and Wang Yitang can all call ourselves socialists, and we can all use this abstract noun to deceive people. Isn't this the great shortcoming and great danger of '-ism'?" ("Collected Works," Vol. 2, p. 150). Honest readers would be mistaken if they thought that Hu Shih would stop talking about socialism from then on. He not only did not refuse to use this term, but used it extensively. For example, he said: "The new religious creed after the mid-nineteenth century is socialism, which is the modern spiritual civilization of the West" ("Collected Works," Series 3, p. 16). He said that the Soviet Union was implementing socialism, the British Labor government was also socialist, and even "factory inspections" and "unemployment relief" in capitalist countries were considered socialism (ibid., p. 18), and even the United States was implementing socialism, which was said to be "liberal socialism" (ibid., p. 85). It cannot be denied that Hu Shih did indeed practice what he called "using the term socialism to deceive people."

    The difference between scientific abstraction and anti-scientific abstraction is that the former is a reflection of the essence of objective things, has definite content, and is not allowed to be arbitrarily abused; the latter is fictitious, does not reflect the essence of objective things at all, and is only for the purpose of confusing the understanding of the essence of things. Using the abstractness of concepts to reverse and confuse them, the purpose is also to eliminate scientific knowledge.

    The true scientific attitude is that when studying any problem, one must not only fully grasp the relevant concrete factual materials, but also strive to grasp the essence of things, the entirety of things, and the internal laws in the development of things. To this end, it is necessary to, as Comrade Mao Zedong said, "go through the process of thinking, and transform and create the rich sensory materials by discarding the crude and selecting the fine, discarding the false and retaining the true, proceeding from one to the other, and from the outside to the inside, to create a system of concepts and theories" ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," p. 280). This is true respect for facts. Without doing this, there is no science. The task of science is to discover the internal laws of the objective world. Only such scientific knowledge can guide people to correctly carry out the social practice of transforming the world. Hu Shih's opposition to scientific abstraction is to prevent people from understanding the essence of things, the entirety of things, and the internal laws in the development of things, and to keep people's understanding at the surface and one-sided phenomena of things, and at fragmented sensory impressions, thereby leading people to wrong concepts and conclusions. Therefore, Hu Shih's so-called "respect for facts" is completely hypocritical and runs counter to the scientific attitude.

    Marxism has a high degree of scientificity because it starts from rich factual materials and can thoroughly reveal the essence and internal laws of things. Comrade Mao Zedong used the four words "seek truth from facts" to explain the scientific attitude of Marxism. "Seek truth from facts" is an old Chinese saying, but Comrade Mao Zedong gave it new content. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "'Facts' are all things that exist objectively, 'truth' is the internal connection of objective things, that is, laws, and 'seeking' is what we are going to study" (ibid., p. 801).

    Of course, one cannot think that Hu Shih's attitude is the same as Marxism simply because Hu Shih sometimes quotes the four words "seek truth from facts." Hu Shih has his own explanation. For example, he said: "'Puxue' (evidential scholarship) is doing the work of 'seeking truth from facts,' using evidence as the foundation to study all ancient cultures." "Everyone studies his small problems… preferring to do small, fragmented problems, unwilling to vainly attempt to form an empty philosophical system."

  ("Collected Works," Series 3, pp. 133-134). It can be seen that Hu Shih's so-called "seeking truth from facts" still wants people to only pay attention to "small, fragmented problems," which is in line with Hu Shih's fundamental attitude of using one-sided and superficial knowledge to exclude the understanding of the laws of things.

    The declining and reactionary class is very afraid of the essence of social and historical phenomena being revealed. In order to prevent the masses of the people from recognizing the truth, the "scholars" of the declining and reactionary class come out and shout that people should only regard the superficial and fragmented sensory impressions of things as the highest truth, and that people cannot and should not pursue the understanding of the essence of things. They describe the scientific abstraction that Marxism has achieved from in-depth research on the objective as empty and meaningless "abstract nouns." This is a rogue tactic of the decadent bourgeoisie to oppose Marxism. Hu Shih also believes that nothing can have a fundamental solution, and the demand for a fundamental solution is illusory. This view is of course also suitable for the interests of the declining and reactionary class. Only by scientifically understanding the objective laws of social history can we find the correct method for the fundamental solution of social problems. Making it impossible for people to understand objective laws also makes a fundamental solution impossible. - This is Hu Shih's true intention in so-called "respecting facts" and opposing "abstract nouns."

    But the anti-scientific nature of Hu Shih's so-called "respect for facts" is not only in negating scientific abstraction. Because the "facts" that Hu Shih speaks of do not even refer to objective existence at all. He not only obliterated the understanding of the essence and laws of phenomena, but also used the philosophical viewpoint of subjective idealism to believe that all phenomena are actually just products of the subjective. - This is the second point mentioned earlier.

    Usually, people think that science, in any case, always takes objective things as the object of research, seeks objective truth, and whether the conclusions of science are correct or not has objective standards; if it is believed that there is no objective thing at all, then science will not be able to be established at all. - This common-sense idea is of course correct. Hu Shih's faction used their subjective idealist magic to fight against this healthy common sense. This fully exposed their reactionary face of being enemies with science.

    In order to impose the corrupt thought of subjective idealism on science, they have a whole set of cunning methods. We must further analyze them.

    II

    Here, we want to take a look at the so-called "science" and "metaphysics" debate that took place in 1923. In this debate, Hu Shih and his gang styled themselves as protectors of science, shouting loudly in support of science and opposing "metaphysical ghosts"; but from this quarrel, we can clearly see how shamelessly they used the corrupt viewpoint of subjective idealism to trample on and insult science.

    There has been a misunderstanding about this so-called "science" and "metaphysics" debate. Some people thought that the people who advocated science at that time used the viewpoint of mechanical materialism to fight against idealism. This is a completely wrong assessment. The arguments made by Hu Shih's faction in this quarrel have nothing to do with materialism, and their opposition to "metaphysics" is not just opposition to idealism.

    Zhang Junmai, who was called a "metaphysical ghost" by Hu Shih and his gang, was indeed an extremely reactionary and notorious idealist. What he peddled was the corrupt thought of the French reactionary "philosopher" Bergson, but the "metaphysics" that Hu Shih and his gang spoke of did not just refer to the idealist viewpoints of Bergson and Zhang Junmai. According to their terminology, anyone who put forward answers to fundamental philosophical questions, such as the question of what the essence of the world is, was called "metaphysics." Hu Shih once said that the attitude of their pragmatists was to "obliterate all fundamental philosophical questions" and "leave them unsettled" ("Collected Works," Vol. 2, p. 110). They called the answers to fundamental philosophical questions, whether materialist or idealist, "metaphysics" and opposed them, which was only a manifestation of their cowardly attitude of avoiding answering such questions.

    But fundamental philosophical questions cannot be obliterated. In modern ideological circles, anyone who tries to avoid fundamental philosophical questions actually adopts an idealist viewpoint on fundamental questions, and an extremely corrupt idealist viewpoint. Pragmatists are exactly like this.

    In the quarrel in 1923, the main general representing Hu Shih's faction was Ding Wenjiang. He avoided answering the fundamental questions of what the essence of the world is and what the relationship between spirit and nature is, but he openly admitted that his viewpoint on epistemology was idealism. In Ding Wenjiang's article entitled "Metaphysics and Science," he discussed his so-called "scientific epistemology" and concluded: "The above is a shallow scientific epistemology. In philosophical terms, it can be said to be skeptical idealism." ("Science and Outlook on Life," p. 12). From Ding Wenjiang's description, it can be seen that the so-called "skeptical idealism" includes the following contents:

    First, they believe that sensory impressions are the only content of knowledge. In Ding Wenjiang's words, it is: "Sensory perception is the only way we know objects." (Ibid., p. 12)

    Second, because they believe that the objects people know are nothing more than people's sensory impressions, they say that there is no objectively existing matter, and matter exists in people's senses. Ding Wenjiang said this: "What we call matter is mostly many recorded sensory perceptions, plus a little direct sensory perception. If our sensory organization were different, what we call matter would certainly change with it." (Ibid., p. 7)

    Third, they believe that whether there is an objectively existing world outside of sensory impressions is unknowable. The so-called "skeptical" means unknowable. Ding Wenjiang said this: "The entity independent of psychology" is "what skeptical idealists consider unknowable" and "should be reserved and not discussed," which is "something inconceivable" (ibid., p. 13).

    Fourth, since they believe that the "entity" of the world is unknowable, and matter is actually people's subjective sensory impressions, then the task of science, in their view, is not to study and discover objectively existing essence and its laws, and the object of science is not objectively existing matter. Ding Wenjiang said that "science... takes psychological phenomena as its content." (Ibid., p. 10). This means that science is just arranging all kinds of sensory impressions that people have and creating various concepts and inferences, and it is not necessary to care whether all this conforms to objective reality.

    Fifth, they believe that scientific knowledge can be recognized by people, not because this scientific knowledge has objective truth, but because the senses and thoughts of ordinary people are the same except for madmen and idiots. Ding Wenjiang's statement is that "the content of the psychology of all ordinary people is the same in nature," so "the truth of science can be recognized by people" (ibid., p. 10). The distinction between the truth and falsehood of various knowledge is not based on whether they conform to reality, but on whether they are "self-contradictory" and can be "deduced from the perception of normal people" (ibid., p. 11).

    Anyone who has read Lenin's "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" will immediately know that these viewpoints are nothing more than a restatement of the subjective idealist thought of the Mach school, which was thoroughly criticized in Lenin's brilliant work. Ding Wenjiang's article clearly admits that his statement is based on Mach and some other "scientists" and "philosophers" who are similar to Mach in thought, including the American pragmatists, James and Dewey, etc.

    In Hu Shih's many articles on philosophy, although he tried his best to say that his viewpoint was above materialism and idealism, and sometimes even stole the signboard of "materialism," his philosophical viewpoint was completely the same as Ding Wenjiang's viewpoint. They worshiped the same master, and they breathed through the same nostril in political activities, so they also promoted the same philosophy. When Hu Shih promoted the pragmatist thought he贩运 from the United States, he also regarded feeling as the only content of knowledge, denied the objectivity of feeling, and believed that feeling was subjective; he also denied the objective standard of truth, and also regarded agnosticism as a pillar of his thought.

    Why is this set of viewpoints subjective idealism?

    There is a materialist understanding of feeling, and there is also an idealist understanding.

    People's common sense always thinks that there must be something objective existing before there can be some kind of sensory impression in people's senses. There is an apple outside, and our eyes see it, and then the feeling of the apple occurs. This common-sense view is correct. From matter to feeling - this is the materialist understanding of feeling. The basic viewpoint of the epistemology of Marxist philosophy is to point out that objectively existing matter is the source of feeling, and to point out that sensory knowledge needs to be raised to rational knowledge, and rational knowledge can more deeply and more completely reflect objective existence. There was a school of empiricists in the history of philosophy who, although they admitted that the source of feeling was matter, only admitted that experience (that is, sensory knowledge) was reliable knowledge, and denied rational knowledge, so they were not thorough materialist thought, and not Marxist dialectical materialism; this kind of empiricist materialism cannot truly defeat idealism because it cannot completely explain reality, but rather has the danger of falling into idealism.

    Sensory knowledge cannot reflect all the profound content of objective existence, and individual fragmented sensory impressions are often superficial, and sometimes even distorted. Subjective idealists use this situation to explain sensory knowledge as completely a product of the subjective. Because they deny that matter is the source of feeling, they are idealists. They say that when people think they see an apple, they actually just have a feeling of an apple, and this feeling does not indicate that there is really such an apple outside. They say that people just combine all the red feelings, fragrant feelings, etc. that they have, and call it an apple. From this, they reach such an absurd conclusion: people's feelings are not caused by objectively existing matter, but rather, the so-called objectively existing matter is actually organized by people's feelings. In this way, they reached the conclusion from the epistemological aspect that it is not existence that determines consciousness, but consciousness that determines existence. Because the consciousness that they say determines existence is each person's subjective feeling, it is subjective idealism. Just to avoid falling into a completely untenable situation, they use agnosticism to supplement this point of view that matter is composed of feelings. This means that all the matter that people know is composed of feelings, as for whether there is anything that people do not know, and what it is, it is impossible to know forever.

    Hu Shih and Ding Wenjiang used such subjective idealist thought to fundamentally deny the scientific understanding of the objective world.

    Since this is the case, why do they dare to call themselves supporters of science and come out to oppose idealism like Zhang Junmai in such a serious manner? Where is the difference between these two aspects? Why are they arguing?

    In order to explain the truth of this kind of quarrel, it is also necessary to start with the problem of abstraction and concreteness mentioned earlier. Originally, abstraction and concreteness were old philosophical problems, and all idealist philosophies always use this problem to create their theories. Abstract concepts and laws are originally generalized from concrete phenomena, but all schools of idealists regard abstraction and concreteness as unrelated opposites, and play out various different tricks in this way.

    Some idealists believe that abstract concepts are not generalized from concrete things, but are independent of all concrete things. So they created mystical concepts such as "absolute concept," "cosmic spirit," and "God," and declared that the entity of the world is this supernatural and superhuman spiritual effect, while the sensible material world is illusory and derived from abstract concepts.

    Objective idealists generally take this path to create their "theories." In the view of Hu Shih and Ding Wenjiang, this is an outdated idealist philosophy. This old-fashioned idealism actually adopts a policy of shrinking territory in the face of science. They give the sensible world to science, and occupy the so-called "metaphysical" sacred and empty palace. Zhang Junmai's article on "the problem of outlook on life" announced that although science can deal with everything in the world, the "problem of outlook on life" is "subjective" because it involves "free will," so science cannot manage it, and can only be dominated by idealist philosophy. This statement aroused the dissatisfaction of Hu Shih and Ding Wenjiang. They wanted to use another form of idealism, adopt a more cunning new strategy, to recover lost ground for idealism, expand territory, and even unify the world.

    Objective idealist philosophy began in ancient Greece with Plato (4th century BC), so it can be said to be a very old form. Hegel, the great German philosopher of the early 19th century, was an objective idealist. The reactionary and corrupt philosophical thought of modern imperialism also takes the form of objective idealism. However, in imperialist countries, the more popular is the thought of subjective idealism. Modern subjective idealist philosophy originated in the early 18th century with the British Bishop Berkeley. In the 19th century, the Austrian philosopher Mach developed this decadent thought in the name of science. This thought was favored by imperialism, first of all by American imperialism. Many "fashionable" philosophical schools in modern imperialist countries, including American pragmatism, have adopted this viewpoint. Hu Shih's faction is a comprador of this kind of imperialist philosophical thought.

    Subjective idealists also absolutely separate abstraction and concreteness, but adopt a form opposite to that of objective idealism. They first declare that all abstractions are false, and then reduce concrete things to human subjective feelings. They say to science: Isn't science going to obtain the most real and reliable things? The most real and reliable thing is human feeling. They say, isn't science going to study matter? But except for feeling, people cannot find any matter, and feeling is matter. Isn't science going to discover laws? The arrangement order of feeling is the law of science. Their conclusion is that in order not to become "metaphysics," science should not vainly attempt to explore the truth of the objective world, but should only take "psychological phenomena" as the content of research, that is, it should only explain the world according to the viewpoint of subjective idealism.

    Simply put, they are trying to make science a tool of subjective idealism with this fraudulent statement, and use the name of science to promote idealism.

    Since they used idealism to糟蹋 science, they could boldly shout "Long live science" and declare "science is omnipotent." Because wherever their "science" goes, idealism goes. Ding Wenjiang used this tone to refute Zhang Junmai, saying that although outlook on life is subjective, science can still intervene in outlook on life because the content of science is originally subjective.

    So although Zhang Junmai and Hu Shih are both idealists, one is trying to grab territory from science, while the other's ambition is to capture all science - this is the truth of the so-called "science" and "metaphysics" debate.

    From this, it can be seen that Hu Shih's two statements, "respect facts" and "reality is a very obedient girl, allowing us to paint and dress her up as we please" ("Collected Works," Vol. 2, p. 106), are not contradictory under the viewpoint of subjective idealism. Because "facts," "reality," and subjective sensory impressions are actually the same things in their view.

    So Hu Shih also said that all scientific laws are just "hypotheses" created by people for convenience, that is to say, they are not reflections of objective reality. According to him, even the earth's orbit around the sun is just a "hypothetical explanation." He said: "Scientific laws are just artificial hypotheses used to explain the phenomena of things. If the explanation is satisfactory, it is true; if the explanation is unsatisfactory, it is not true, and another hypothesis should be found to replace it." ("Collected Works," Vol. 2, p. 78). This nakedly anti-scientific statement shows the truth of the "scientific attitude" that he boasted about in "respecting facts." According to the subjective idealist viewpoint, scientific laws are nothing more than the arrangement order of people's various feelings, so they are all subjective "hypotheses."

    Not only in this quarrel in 1923, but also in many other occasions, Hu Shih intentionally flaunted that his thought was opposed to "orthodox" idealist thought. For example, he said, "What we human beings want is not the absolutely existing 'Tao' or 'Principle,' but the truth of this time, this situation, and this me." ("Collected Works," Vol. 2, p. 81) For another example, he said that the "scientific attitude" of the Han scholars of the Qing Dynasty was that they did not "vainly attempt to form an empty philosophical system" like the Neo-Confucian scholars of the Song Dynasty, vainly attempting "that 'sudden enlightenment' of absolute wisdom," but "escaped from the virtual and pursued the real, preferring to do small, fragmented problems," seeking "the principles of this thing and that thing" ("Collected Works," Series 3, pp. 134 and Vol. 2, pp. 209, 210). The intention of this kind of statement is to confuse people, making people think that he is opposed to idealism, but in reality, he just wants to abandon a form of unfashionable idealist philosophy, and transport a fashionable form of idealist philosophy. The so-called "absolutely existing Tao" and "empty philosophical system" are certainly the magic of idealism to deceive people, but the "feelings" and "experiences" of subjective idealists are also heretical theories that deny objective knowledge.

    This fashionable idealist philosophy is a more cunning enemy of materialism, that is, a more vicious enemy of science.

III

    Based on the above, it can be seen that Hu Shih's fundamental method of distorting and slandering science in the name of supporting science is to not only obliterate rational knowledge, which is a profound reflection of objective reality, but also to cancel the objective content of sensory knowledge. This fundamentally denies the objectivity of knowledge.

    Under modern historical conditions, materialism and idealism have launched an extremely sharp struggle, especially on the issue of epistemology. This aspect of the problem is a matter of life and death for science.

    Natural science, by its nature, treats nature with a spontaneous materialist attitude. Idealist thought always uses the underdeveloped state of science, and the difficult situations that occur in the development of science, to carry out deceptive propaganda. Every step of the progress of natural science cannot but be a refutation of idealist philosophy. The viciousness of this school of subjective idealism trafficked into China by the Hu Shih faction lies in the fact that it has penetrated into the inside of natural science to destroy that spontaneous materialist tendency; it uses the epistemology of subjective idealism to subjectively distort the ways in which people obtain knowledge about the objective world, thereby denying the possibility of recognizing the truth of the objective world, and making natural science automatically give up the continuous and in-depth exploration of objective laws.

    Needless to say, this epistemology of subjective idealism, which represents the decaying bourgeoisie, cannot but be the mortal enemy of true social science in the field of social and historical problem research.

    Only Marxist philosophy - dialectical materialism - provides a complete theory that can guide the forward development of natural science and social science. The Marxist worldview and method are constantly enriched by the development achievements of natural science and social science. It is a summary of the achievements of various sciences, so it is the only reliable philosophical basis for any department of science. Marxist philosophy is neither opposed to the various sciences that study nature and society, nor does it replace them. Marxist philosophy is to study objective laws, so it is scientific philosophy. It differs from various specific sciences in that its research object is the most general objective laws of nature, society, and cognition. It proves the existence of objective laws of nature and society, and proves that this law, that is, the essence of the objective world, can be known by people. The Marxist materialist theory of cognition shatters the various mazes used by idealist philosophy to limit human cognition, and fully elucidates the ways in which people approach objective truth and master objective truth step by step.

    Marxist materialism points out that matter exists independently of human consciousness, that objectively existing matter is the source of human feeling and thinking, and that human feeling and thinking are reflections of objectively existing matter. Feeling is the most direct path for people to obtain knowledge about the objective world. Although sensory knowledge cannot completely and deeply reflect the objective world, feeling has objective content, and sensory knowledge contains a true reflection of objective reality. By rising from sensory knowledge to rational knowledge, people can obtain knowledge of the essence and laws of the objective world, that is, scientific knowledge.

    Marxism's theory of the role of practice in cognition further shatters all the lies of idealists. People influence the objective world through social practice activities, and promote changes in the surrounding reality. This practical activity is the basis for the development of cognition, and also the objective standard of cognition. Practice not only proves the existence of the objective world independent of human consciousness, but also, when the practical activities carried out by people based on their scientific understanding of objective reality achieve the expected goals, it undoubtedly proves the correctness of this understanding. The development of social practice ensures that people can step by step obtain scientific knowledge of the essence and laws of all aspects of the objective world.

    The Marxist viewpoint of practice gives a fatal blow to the various subjectivism and agnosticism of idealists. It can be imagined that idealists will not but struggle desperately on this issue.

    Various schools of idealists distort practice in various forms. The pragmatism trafficked by Hu Shih is a trick of "mixing fish eyes with pearls." They attempt to replace the Marxist viewpoint of practice with the despicable practical viewpoint of the bourgeoisie.

    Hu Shih called pragmatism "experimentalism," and said that the fundamental attitude of experimentalism is "the attitude of the scientific laboratory," so he boasted: "Experimentalism is just the application of scientific method in philosophy." ("Collected Works," Vol. 2, p. 83). What is called "the attitude of the scientific laboratory"? Hu Shih said: "Experimentalism never admits that what we call 'truth' is an eternally unchanging principle of nature; it only admits that all 'truth' is applied hypotheses; whether a hypothesis is true or not depends entirely on whether it can produce the effects it should produce. This is 'the attitude of the scientific laboratory.'" (Ibid., p. 80). The so-called "attitude of the scientific laboratory," according to their own explanation, is the attitude that everything is determined by "effect."

    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "To determine whether knowledge or theory is truth is not determined by how it feels subjectively, but by the results of objective social practice." ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," p. 273) - This is the Marxist viewpoint. The "effect" that Hu Shih and his gang speak of does not refer to objective results, but refers to whether it is useful to people, that is, whether people feel it is useful. What is useful is true. Hu Shih said: "Truth is just a tool to deal with the environment" ("Collected Works," Vol. 2, p. 81); "Truth is originally made by people, for people, made by people for people to use, it is because they are very useful that they are given the beautiful name of 'truth'. What we call truth is originally just a tool of people..." (Ibid., p. 101) This is the meaning of what Hu Shih said, "whether a hypothesis is true or not depends on whether it can produce effects."

    Obviously, this attitude is completely suitable for the decaying and reactionary bourgeoisie. When a natural scientist makes some invention in the laboratory that can improve productivity, if the capitalist thinks that this invention cannot help him make more money, but will cause him to lose money because he has to replace the enterprise equipment, the capitalist would rather declare that this invention is not "true." Of course, not to mention the scientific theory about the laws of social development that is not only useless but also greatly harmful in the eyes of the bourgeoisie. Hu Shih once used the viewpoint of "should pay attention to the effects that each theory has already produced" to look at the Marxist theory of class struggle. He did not ask whether this theory conforms to the facts, he just said: "This theory is too biased towards stating the 'consciousness of the class,' and invisibly cultivates a hatred of the class" ("Collected Works," Vol. 2, p. 196). Hu Shih felt that this "effect" was very bad, so he thought this theory was wrong.

    It is an insult to science that pragmatists call this viewpoint "the attitude of the scientific laboratory." The labor of natural scientists in the laboratory should be respected. Marxism believes that scientific experiments and scientific observations are a necessary form of practice as an objective standard of cognition. Of course, human social practice is extremely broad, including production activities and class struggle, political life, science and art activities, etc., and cannot be summarized by scientific experiments. But it must be pointed out that Hu Shih's effect theory and true scientific experiments are not the same thing.

    When Hu Shih was talking about whether something "mysterious and profound" like the soul exists, he said: "Since it is 'mysterious and profound,' it cannot be proven by scientific experiments, nor can it be refuted by scientific experiments. Since this is the case, we can only use the experimentalist method to see what the actual effect of this theory is, as the standard for evaluation. According to this standard, there are indeed good people who believe in the theory of the immortality of the soul, and those who believe in the theory of the extinction of the soul are not necessarily all bad people.... In short, the question of whether the soul is extinguished or not really does not have any major impact on human behavior; since there is no actual impact, it can simply be said that it is not a problem." ("Collected Works," Vol. 4, p. 107) This clearly admits that the so-called "experimentalist method of looking at actual effects" is not a scientific experiment, but just a subjective method of the reactionary bourgeoisie to reverse right and wrong according to their own despicable interests. According to this method, if all the people who do not believe in the soul are the "bad people" that Hu Shih said, Hu Shih must admit that the soul is immortal.

    This bourgeois "practical" viewpoint of denying objective truth, and the Marxist viewpoint that practice is the standard of truth, are certainly not "a hair's breadth apart," but are fundamentally poles apart,

    唯心主义是科学的敌人
　　——论胡适派思想对科学的曲解和污蔑
    胡绳
    胡适的实用主义思想是极端反科学的主观唯心主义。但胡适和他的同伙都吹嘘自己是拥护科学、提倡科学的人。为了用科学的招牌掩盖自己的真面目，胡适经常搬弄“尊重事实”、“跟着事实走”等等说法。人们如果不了解胡适思想的本质，就会以为，胡适也许并不是一个彻底的唯心主义者，或者以为，主观唯心主义思想并不妨害人们真正研究科学和坚持科学态度。胡适一伙人的目的就在于混淆唯心主义和唯物主义的区别，使科学成为唯心主义世界观的工具，从而在根本上破坏科学。
    为了严格划清唯物主义和唯心主义的界限，为了使科学不致被唯心主义引入歧途，为了捍卫只有在唯物主义世界观基础上才能确立的科学态度、科学方法，我们有必要来彻底揭露胡适的欺骗。我们要指出，胡适的所谓“尊重事实”其实不是真正的尊重事实，胡适的所谓“尊重事实”“提倡科学”是同他的主观唯心主义的根本观点紧密地结合在一起的，隐藏在这些字眼下面的是彻头彻尾反科学的态度。
    一
    为什么胡适的所谓“尊重事实”其实并不是真正的尊重事实呢？
    因为，第一，胡适所说的“事实”至多只是个别的材料、个别的现象，胡适所说的“尊重事实”并不是为了认识客观事物的本质和客观规律性，反而是利用个别的材料和现象来混淆本质和规律性的认识。
    而且，第二，胡适所说的“事实”并不是在人的意识以外的客观存在。按照胡适这一派人的主观唯心主义的观点说来，人所认识的并不是客观的存在，他们所谓“事实”只是主观的产物。
    这两点都牵涉到哲学上的认识论问题。用马克思主义哲学的认识论做武器，就可以彻底揭穿胡适的骗术。我们先来说这里的第一点。
    胡适经常在他所谓“尊重事实”的名义下反对使用“抽象名词”。从这种说法中可以明显地看到，胡适是在用一种狡猾的形式来阻止人们对于客观事物内在的本质和规律性的揭发。
    最早在一九一九年胡适写的“问题与主义”里，他就说，他反对谈主义，特别是反对谈社会主义的主要理由就是因为主义是一个“抽象名词”。他说：“主张成了主义，便由具体的计划，变成一个抽象的名词。‘主义’的弱点和危险，就在这里”（“胡适文存”卷二，页一四九—一五○）。到了一九二八年，他又写道：“世间的大问题决不是一两个抽象名词（如‘资本主义’‘共产主义’等等）所能完全包括的。最要紧的是事实。现今许多朋友却只高谈主义，不肯看看事实。……拿一个‘赤’字抹杀新运动，那是张作霖吴佩孚的把戏。然而拿一个‘资本主义’来抹杀一切现代国家，这种眼光究竟比张作霖吴佩孚高明多少？”（“文存”三集，页六三—六四，着重点是原来有的。）
    胡适的历年文章中，这类的说法还多得很。在一九三五年他索性宣布，使用封建主义，资本主义，社会主义，共产主义等等名词就是“今日思想界的一个大弊病”。他说他所反对的就是“用一个抽象名词来替代许多具体的历史事实”，“这毛病是笼统，是混沌，是抹煞事实”（“独立评论”第一五三号）。
    照胡适说起来，他反对“抽象名词”，就因为他尊重具体事实；科学态度就应该是像他那样地尊重具体事实。
    胡适用这套说法来把抽象和具体说成是绝对对立的，使人认为只有个别的具体的东西是真实的，而抽象的东西则是虚幻的，是毫无意义的。这种说法是完全错误的。
    无论哪一门自然科学或社会科学都不能不运用抽象的思维。科学的抽象是从许多具体事实中找出它们本质上的共同的东西而加以概括，深入地揭露事物内在的联系和内在的规律性。事物的本质和内在规律性不是人们能够直接看到摸到的，必须通过人的思维，人们才能把握到。所以科学的抽象就一方面说来，因为是撇开了事物的外部现象上的种种非本质的、偶然的因素，所以好像是离开了感性的具体的事物，而就另一方面说来，却是以具体的感性知识为基础而更深刻地，更真实地反映了客观事物。
    所以科学的抽象是不能反对的。排斥科学的抽象就是排斥理性知识，就是排斥对事物的本质，事物的内在规律性的认识，也就是排斥科学本身。
    胡适所反对的就是这种科学的抽象。
    我们把胡适所歌颂的“现代国家”用“资本主义”这一个概念概括起来，当然是正确的，必要的。因为这个概念是把事物的本质揭发出来了。
    我们现在正在为建设我们的国家而进行着这样那样的无数具体的工作，具体的斗争，把这一切概括起来，就叫做社会主义的建设和改造，也就是社会主义革命。这个概念从本质上表明了我们所进行的工作和斗争的内容。
    胡适所反对的资本主义、帝国主义、封建主义、社会主义等等名词是在马克思主义传入中国后而日益被普遍地使用的。马克思主义用这些名词来表现具有明确内容的科学概念。这些名词很快地为广大人民接受，就因为它们是历史现象的本质的反映。胡适之流虽然竭力想排斥也排斥不了。
    正因为胡适的目的是取消科学的认识，所以他所反对的也只是科学的抽象。胡适既然把抽象性的概念看做不过是虚构的东西，从而攻击科学的概念，于是他就完全按照自己的需要和方便而任意地玩弄概念。在胡适的文章中大量地使用了各种含意不定，内容不明的概念，并故意使得本来有明确内容的科学概念成为模糊不清的名词。这里只举一个例。胡适为了反对社会主义曾说：“你和我和王揖唐都可自称社会主义家，都可用这一个抽象名词来骗人。这不是‘主义’的大缺点和大危险吗？”（“文存”卷二，页一五○）老实的读者如果以为胡适从此闭口不谈社会主义，那就错了。他不但不拒绝用这个名词，而且大用特用。例如他说：“十九世纪中叶以后的新宗教信条是社会主义，这是西洋近代的精神文明”（“文存”三集，页一六）。他说，苏联是在实行社会主义，英国工党政府也是社会主义，而且连资本主义国家中的“工厂视察”，“失业救济”等等都算做社会主义（同上，页一八），甚至连美国也是实行了社会主义，据说那叫做“自由社会主义”（同上，页八五）。不能不承认，所谓“用社会主义这个名词来骗人”，胡适的确是实行了的。
    科学的抽象和反科学的抽象的区别在于：前者是客观事物的本质的反映，是有确定的内容的，是不容许任意滥用的；后者则是虚构出来的，是完全不反映客观事物的本质，而只是为了混淆对事物本质的认识。利用概念的抽象性而加以颠倒错乱，其目的同样是在于取消科学的认识。
    真正的科学态度是在研究任何问题时不但一定要充分地掌握有关的具体的事实材料，而且还一定要力求抓住事物的本质、事物的全体、事物发展中的内在规律性。为此，就一定要像毛泽东同志所说的“经过思考作用，将丰富的感觉材料加以去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及裹的改造制作工夫，造成概念和理论的系统”（“毛泽东选集”，页二八○）。这才是真正的尊重事实。不这样做，就没有科学。科学的任务就在于发现客观世界的内在的规律。也只有这样的科学知识才能指导人们正确地进行改造世界的社会实践。胡适的反对科学的抽象就是阻止人们认识事物的本质、事物的全体、事物发展中的内在规律性，而使人们的认识停留在事物的表面的和片面的现象上面，停留在支离破碎的感觉印象上面，从而把人们引导到错误的概念和结论上去。所以胡适的所谓“尊重事实”完全是虚伪的，恰恰和科学态度背道而驰。
    马克思主义具有高度的科学性，就因为它是从丰富的事实材料出发，而又能彻底揭发事物的本质和内在规律性。毛泽东同志用“实事求是”四个字来说明马克思主义的科学态度。“实事求是”是句中国的老话，但毛泽东同志赋与它以新的内容。毛泽东同志说：“‘实事’就是客观存在着的一切事物，‘是’就是客观事物的内部联系，即规律性，‘求’就是我们去研究。”（同上，页八○一）
    当然不能因为胡适有时引用“实事求是”这四个字而认为胡适的态度同马克思主义有什么相同之处。胡适有他自己的解释。例如他说：“‘朴学’是做‘实事求是’的工夫，用证据作基础，考订一切古文化。”“人人研究他的小问题，……宁可做细碎的小问题，不肯妄想组成空虚的哲学系统。”
  （“文存”三集，页一三三—一三四）可见胡适所说的“实事求是”也还是要人们只去注意“细碎的小问题”，这是同胡适的根本态度，用片面的表面的知识来排斥对事物的规律性的认识的根本态度相适应的。
    没落的反动的阶级非常害怕社会历史现象的本质被揭露出来。为了阻止人民群众认识真理，没落的反动的阶级的“学者”们就出来叫嚷说，人们只应该把对于事物的表面的零碎的感觉印象当做最高的真实，人们不可能也不应该去追求对事物的本质的认识。他们把马克思主义从对客观的深刻研究中达到的科学的抽象说成是空幻的、毫无意义的“抽象名词”。这是腐朽资产阶级反对马克思主义的一个无赖的手法。胡适又认为，任何事情都不能有根本的解决，根本解决的要求都是虚妄。这种看法当然也正是适合于没落的反动阶级的利益的。只有科学地认识社会历史的客观规律性，才能找到社会问题的根本解决的正确方法，使人们不可能认识客观规律性，也就是使得根本解决成为不可能。——这就是胡适所谓“尊重事实”，反对“抽象名词”的真正的用意。
    但胡适所谓“尊重事实”的反科学性还不仅在于否定科学的抽象。因为胡适所说的“事实”甚至根本不是指客观的存在。他不但抹煞了对现象的本质和规律性的认识，而且用了主观唯心主义的哲学观点来认为，一切现象其实只是主观的产物。——这就是前面所指出的第二点。
    通常人们都以为，科学，无论如何总是以客观的事物为研究对象的，是寻求客观的真理的，科学的结论正确与否是有客观标准的；如果认为根本没有什么客观的事物，那就会使科学根本不能成立。——这种常识性的想法当然是正确的。胡适这一派人用他们的主观唯心主义的魔术来同这种健康的常识作战。这样就把他们同科学为敌的反动面目充分暴露出来了。
    为了把主观唯心主义的腐败思想强加于科学头上，他们有一整套的狡猾的手法。我们必需进一步加以分析。
    二
    在这里，我们要来看一下发生在一九二三年的所谓“科学”和“玄学”之争。在这个论争中，胡适一伙人自命为科学的保护人，大声叫嚷着拥护科学而反对“玄学鬼”；但从这场争吵中，我们可以明显地看到，他们是如何无耻地用腐朽的主观唯心主义的观点来糟蹋和侮辱科学。
    对于这一场所谓“科学”和“玄学”之争，曾经有过一种误解。有人以为当时主张科学的人是用了机械唯物主义的观点来同唯心主义做斗争。这是完全错误的估计。胡适一派人在这场争吵中所发表的议论同唯物主义毫不相干，而且他们的反对“玄学”，也并不就是反对唯心主义。
    被胡适一伙人称为“玄学鬼”的张君勱固然是个极端反动的、臭名昭著的唯心主义者，他所贩运的是法国的反动“哲学家”柏格森的腐朽思想，但胡适一伙人所说的“玄学”并不就是指柏格森、张君勱的唯心主义观点。按照他们的用语，凡是对哲学上的根本问题，例如世界的本质是什么的问题，提出答案的，都叫做“玄学”。胡适曾说，他们实用主义者的态度是把“哲学根本问题一齐抹煞”，
  “以不了了之”（“文存”卷二，页一一○）。他们把在哲学根本问题上的答案，不管是唯物主义的答案还是唯心主义的答案，一律叫做“玄学”而加以反对，这只是他们回避答复这种问题的卑怯态度的表现。
    但是哲学的根本问题是抹煞不了的。在现代思想界中，凡是企图躲开哲学上的根本问题的人，实际上总是在根本问题上采取了唯心主义观点，而且是极端腐败的唯心主义观点。实用主义者正是这样的情形。
    在一九二三年的那场争吵中，代表胡适派出马的主将是丁文江，他避开了正面答复世界的本质是什么和精神对自然界的关系是怎样的根本问题，但他却公开招认了他在认识论上的观点乃是唯心主义。在丁文江的题目是“玄学与科学”的文章中，论述了他所谓“科学的知识论”，结论说：“以上所讲的是一种浅近的科学知识论。用哲学的名词讲起来，可以说是存疑的唯心论（Skeptical　Ideal-ism）。”（“科学与人生观”，页十二）从丁文江的叙述中，可以看到，所谓“存疑的唯心论”包含这一些内容：
    第一，他们认为，感觉印象是知识的唯一内容。用丁文江的话来说，就是：“觉官感触为我们知道物体唯一的方法。”（同上，页十二）
    第二，因为他们认为人们所知道的物体无非人们的感觉印象，所以他们说，并没有什么客观存在的物质，物质就存在于人们的感觉中。丁文江这样说：“我们之所谓物质，大多数是许多记存的觉官感触，加了一点直接觉官感触。假如我们的觉官组织是另外一个样子的，我们所谓物质一定也随之而变。”（同上，页七）
    第三，他们认为，在感觉印象以外是否还有客观存在的世界，那是不可知的。所谓“存疑”，就是不可知的意思。丁文江这样说：“离心理而独立的本体”是“存疑唯心论者所认为不可知的”，“应该存而不论”，那是“不可思议的东西”（同上，页十三）。
    第四，既然他们认为世界的“本体”是不可知的，而物质其实是人们的主观的感觉印象，那么科学的任务，在他们看来，就不是去研究和发现客观存在的本质及其规律性，科学的对象也不是客观存在的物质。丁文江说，“科学……以心理上的现象为内容。”（同上，页十）这就是说，科学不过是把人所有的各种感觉印象加以排比，并且制造出种种概念和推论来，这一切是否同客观实在相符合是用不着管的。
    第五，他们认为，科学知识能够为人们公认，并不是因为这些科学知识有客观真实性，而是因为除了疯子痴子以外，一般人的感觉和想法是相同的。丁文江的说法就是，“凡常人心理的内容，其性质都是相同的”，所以“科学的真相，才能为人所公认”（同上，页十）。区别各种知识的真伪，也不是看它们是否符合实际，而只是看它们是否“自相矛盾”，能不能“从不反常的人的知觉推断出来”（同上，页十一）。
    读过列宁的“唯物论与经验批判论”的人立刻就能知道，这些观点无非是在列宁的这部光辉著作中彻底批驳了的马赫学派的主观唯心主义思想的复述。丁文江的文章中明白地承认，他的说法是根据马赫和在思想上类似马赫的其他一些“科学家”“哲学家”，包括美国的实用主义者，詹姆士和杜威等而来的。
    在胡适的许多谈哲学的文章中，虽然竭力把自己的观点说成是超乎唯物唯心以上，而且有时还盗用“唯物”做招牌，但是他的哲学观点同丁文江的观点是完全一样的。他们拜了同样的师傅，他们在政治活动上完全一鼻孔出气，所以他们也宣传同样的哲学。胡适在鼓吹他从美国贩来的实用主义思想时，也把感觉看做知识的唯一内容，并否认感觉的客观性，而认为感觉是主观的东西；他也否认真理的客观标准，也把不可知论当做自己的思想的一个支柱。
    为什么这一套观点就是主观唯心主义呢？
    对于感觉，有唯物主义的了解，也有唯心主义的了解。
    人们的常识总是以为，一定要存在着某种客观的东西，人们的感官中才会有某种感觉印象。外界有个苹果，我们的眼睛看到，才发生了苹果的感觉。这种常识的看法是正确的。从物质到感觉——这是唯物论对感觉的了解。马克思主义哲学的认识论的基本观点就是指出客观存在的物质乃是感觉的源泉，并且指出，感性知识有提高到理性知识的必要，理性知识能够更深刻更完满地反映客观存在。哲学史上有一派经验主义者，虽然承认感觉的源泉是物质，但他们只承认经验（即感性知识）是可靠的知识，而否认理性知识，所以他们还不是彻底的唯物主义思想，还不是马克思主义的辩证唯物主义；这种经验主义的唯物主义因为不能够完全地解释现实，所以就不能真正战胜唯心主义，反而有陷入唯心主义的危险。
    感性知识还不能把客观存在的全部的深刻内容反映出来，个别的片段的感觉印象时常是皮毛的，甚至有时还会是歪曲的。主观唯心主义者就利用这种情形而把感性知识解释做完全是主观的产物。因为他们否认了物质是感觉的源泉，所以他们就是唯心主义者。他们说，当人们自以为看到一个苹果时，其实不过是人们有了一个苹果的感觉，这种感觉并不能表明外界真有这样的一个苹果。他们说，人们不过是把自己所有的红色的感觉、香味的感觉等等综合起来，就称之为苹果。由此他们达到这样的荒谬的结论：人们的感觉并不是由客观存在的物质引起的，反而是，所谓客观存在的物质其实是由人们的感觉所组织成功的。这样他们就从认识论方面达到了不是存在决定意识，而是意识决定存在的结论。因为他们所说的决定存在的意识是每个人主观的感觉，所以是主观唯心主义。只是为了避免陷入完全无法自圆其说的境地，他们又用不可知论来补充这种物质由感觉组成的论点。这是说，人所知道的物质都是由感觉组成的，至于人所不知道的究竟有没有，是什么，那是永远不可能知道的。
    胡适、丁文江就是用这样的主观唯心主义思想来根本否认对客观世界的科学认识。
    既然如此，为什么他们又敢于自称拥护科学并且作古正经地出来反对张君勱那样的唯心主义呢？这两方面的区别究竟在那里？他们争吵是为什么？
    为了说明这种争吵的真象，还要从前面说过的抽象和具体的问题说起，原来抽象和具体是个哲学上的老问题，一切唯心哲学总是利用这个问题来制造他们的理论。抽象的概念、法则本来是从具体现象中概括出来的，但各派唯心论者都把抽象和具体看做各不相关的对立体，这样来玩出各种不同的花样。
    有一些唯心主义者认为抽象观念并不是从具体事物中概括出来，而是独立于一切具体事物之外的。于是他们制造出了“绝对观念”“宇宙精神”“上帝”这一类神秘的观念，并且宣布世界的本体就是这种超自然、超人类的精神作用，而可以感觉到的物质世界反而是虚幻的，是从抽象观念中派生出来的。
    客观唯心主义者大体上是走这条路来制造他们的“理论”。在胡适、丁文江看来，这已经是过了时的唯心主义哲学。这种老派的唯心主义在科学面前实际上采取了缩小地盘的政策，他们把可以感觉到的世界让给科学，而自居于所谓“形而上”的神圣而空幻的殿堂里。张君勱所作关于“人生观问题”的文章就是宣布科学虽能处理世间万事万物，但“人生观问题”，因为是“主观”的，是涉及“自由意志”的，所以科学管不着，只能由唯心主义哲学来主宰。这种说法引起了胡适、丁文江的不满，他们想运用另一种形式的唯心主义，采取更狡诈的新的战略，来为唯心主义收复失地，扩大地盘，以至统一天下。
    客观唯心主义哲学在欧洲哲学史上开始于古代希腊的柏拉图（公元前四世纪），所以可说是很古老的形式。十九世纪初叶的德国大哲学家黑格尔是个客观唯心主义者。现代帝国主义的反动的腐朽的哲学思想也有采取客观唯心主义的形式的。但在帝国主义国家中更流行的却是主观唯心主义的思想。现代的主观唯心主义哲学发源于十八世纪初叶的英国主教贝克莱，十九世纪奥国的哲学家马赫在科学的名义下发挥了这种陈腐的思想。这种思想受到帝国主义，首先是美帝国主义的宠信。现代帝国主义国家中的许多“时髦”的哲学流派，包括美国的实用主义，都采用了这种观点。胡适一派人乃是这一种帝国主义的哲学思想的买办。
    主观唯心主义者也把抽象和具体绝对隔绝开来，但采取了同客观唯心主义相反的形式，他们首先宣布一切抽象都是虚假的，然后又把具体的东西归结为人的主观感觉。他们向科学说：科学不是要取得最实在可靠的东西么？最实在、最可靠的东西就是人的感觉。他们说，科学不是要研究物质么？但除了感觉以外，人们是找不到任何物质的，感觉就是物质。科学不是要发现规律性么？感觉的排列次序就是科学的规律性。他们的结论是，科学为了不成为“玄学”，就不应当妄想探究客观世界的真象，而只应当把“心理上的现象”当做研究的内容，也就是只应当按照主观唯心主义的观点来解释世界。
    简单说起来，他们就是用这种诡诈的说法来企图使科学变成主观唯心主义的工具，并且利用科学的名义宣传唯心主义。
    他们既然用唯心主义糟蹋了科学，他们就可以放胆地高喊“科学万岁”，宣布“科学万能”了。因为在他们的“科学”所到之处就是唯心主义所到之处。丁文江正是用这种腔调来驳斥张君勱的，他说，人生观固然是主观的，但科学并不因此而不能过问人生观，因为科学的内容本来就是主观的。
    所以张君勱和胡适虽然都是唯心主义，但一边的做法是同科学抢地盘，而另一边的野心是要俘掳一切科学，——所谓“科学”和“玄学”之争的真象就是如此。
    由此可见，胡适一面说“尊重事实”，一面又说，“实在是一个狠服从的女孩子，百依百顺的由我们替他涂抹起来，装扮起来”（“文存”卷二，页一○六），这两种说法在主观唯心主义的观点下是并不矛盾的。因为“事实”“实在”和主观的感觉印象在他们看来，其实是同样的东西。
    所以胡适又说，一切科学法则都不过是人们为了方便起见造出来的“假设”，也就是说，都不是对客观现实的反映。照他说来，连地球绕日而行也只是一种“假设的解释”。他说：“科学律例”“不过是人造的假设用来解释事物现象的，解释的满意，就是真的；解释的不满人意，便不是真的，便该寻别种假设来代他了。”（“文存”卷二，页七八）这种赤裸裸的反科学的说法表明了他所吹嘘的“尊重事实”的“科学态度”的真象。按照主观唯心主义观点说来，科学法则无非是人的种种感觉的排列次序，所以都是主观的“假设”。
    不但在一九二三年的这一次争吵，而且在其他许多场合，胡适都有意标榜他的思想是同“正统”的唯心主义思想相对抗的。例如他说，“我们人类所要的知识，并不是那绝对存立的‘道’哪，‘理’哪，乃是这个时间，这个境地，这个我的这个真理。”（“文存”卷二，页八一）又例如他说，清朝汉学家的“科学态度”就在于他们不像宋朝理学家那样“妄想组成空虚的哲学系统”，妄想“那‘一旦豁然贯通’的绝对的智慧”，而是“逃虚就实，宁可做细碎的小问题”，所求的是“这物那物的道理”（“文存”三集，页一三四和卷二，页二○九、二一○）。这一类的说法的用意都是想迷惑人，使人以为他是反对唯心主义的，但实际上，他只是想抛弃掉一种不时髦的唯心主义哲学的形式，而来运输一种时髦的唯心主义哲学的形式。所谓“绝对存立的道”，“空虚的哲学系统”等等固然是唯心主义骗人的魔术，而主观唯心主义者的“感觉”“经验”同样也是否定客观知识的邪说。
    这种时髦的唯心主义哲学乃是唯物主义的更狡猾的敌人，也就是科学的更恶毒的敌人。三    根据以上所述，可以看到，胡适在拥护科学的名义下曲解和污蔑科学的根本办法就是：不但抹煞作为客观现实的深刻反映的理性认识，而且取消感性认识的客观内容。这样就从根本上否认了知识的客观性。
    在现代的历史条件下，唯物主义和唯心主义特别是在认识论问题上展开了极其尖锐的斗争。这方面的问题，对于科学是有关生死存亡的问题。
    自然科学按其本性说，是以自发的唯物主义的态度来对待自然界的。唯心主义思想总是利用科学不发达的状况，利用科学发展中发生困难的状况而进行欺骗的宣传。自然科学的每一步的进展不能不是对于唯心主义哲学的驳斥。由胡适派所贩运到中国来的这一派主观唯心主义的恶毒就在于它钻到了自然科学的里边，来破坏那种自发的唯物主义倾向；它用主观唯心主义的认识论来把人取得关于客观世界的知识的途径都作了主观主义的歪曲，从而否定了认识客观世界真象的可能，使自然科学自动地放弃对客观规律性的不断深入地探求。
    不用说得，这种代表腐朽资产阶级的主观唯心主义的认识论，在社会历史问题研究的领域内，也不能不是真正的社会科学的死敌。
    只有马克思主义哲学——辩证唯物主义提供了能够指导自然科学和社会科学向前发展的完整的理论。马克思主义的世界观和方法不断地用自然科学和社会科学的发展成就来充实自己，它是各门科学的成果的概括和总结，因此它对于任何部门的科学都是唯一可靠的哲学基础。马克思主义哲学既不同研究自然界和社会的各门科学相对立，也不代替它们。马克思主义哲学是研究客观规律的，所以是科学的哲学，它同各门具体科学的不同在于它的研究对象是自然界、社会和认识的最一般的客观规律。它论证了自然界和社会的客观规律性的存在，并且证明，这种规律性，亦即客观世界的本质是人所能够认识的。马克思主义唯物论关于认识的理论粉碎了唯心主义哲学的用来限制人的认识的各种迷阵，充分地阐明了人如何一步步地接近客观真理和掌握客观真理的途径。
    马克思主义唯物论指出，物质是不依赖人的意识而独立存在的，客观存在的物质是人的感觉和思维的源泉，人的感觉和思维是客观存在的物质的反映。感觉是人取得关于客观世界的知识的最直接的通路，感性知识虽然还不能完全地深刻地反映客观世界，但是感觉是具有客观内容的，感性知识中包含着对客观现实的真实的反映。以感性知识为基础而上升到理性知识，人就能够取得对于客观世界的本质和规律性的知识，也就是能够取得科学的知识。
    马克思主义关于实践在认识中的作用的理论进一步粉碎了一切唯心主义者的谎话。人通过社会的实践活动来影响客观世界，促成周围现实中的改变。这种实践活动是认识发展的基础，又是认识的客观标准。实践不但证明独立于人的意识以外的客观世界的存在，而且当人们根据自己对客观现实的科学认识而进行的实践活动达到了预期的目的时，就无可怀疑地证明了这种认识的正确性。社会实践的发展保证了人能够一步深入一步地取得对于客观世界的一切方面的本质和规律性的科学认识。
    马克思主义的实践观点给唯心主义者的形形色色的主观主义和不可知论以致命的打击。可以设想，唯心主义者是不会不在这个问题上进行拚命的挣扎的。
    各派唯心主义者对实践进行各种形式的曲解。由胡适所贩运来的实用主义是采取“鱼目混珠”的诡计，他们企图拿资产阶级的卑鄙的实用的观点来代替马克思主义的实践的观点。
    胡适把实用主义称作“实验主义”，他说实验主义的根本态度就是“科学试验室的态度”，因此他吹嘘说：“实验主义不过是科学方法在哲学上的应用。”（“文存”卷二，页八三）什么叫做“科学试验室的态度”呢？胡适说：“实验主义绝不承认我们所谓‘真理’就是永永不变的天理；他只承认一切‘真理’都是应用的假设；假设的真不真，全靠他能不能发生他所应该发生的效果。这就是‘科学试验室的态度’。”（同上，页八○）所谓“科学试验室的态度”按照他们自己的解释，就是一切决定于“效果”的态度。
    毛泽东同志说：“判定认识或理论之是否真理，不是依主观上觉得如何而定，而是依客观上社会实践的结果如何而定。”（“毛泽东选集”，页二七三）——这是马克思主义的观点。而胡适他们所说的“效果”恰恰不是指客观上的结果，而是指对人有没有用处，亦即人是否觉得有用。——这就是唯心主义的观点。
    实用主义者在所谓“科学试验室的态度”的名义下的真正态度其实是：企图用腐朽资产阶级的个人利益来作为“真理”的标准，他们说，要判断一种思想理论是不是真实的，并不看它是否符合于客观事实，而只是看它是不是对人有用。有用的就是真的。胡适说：“真理不过是对付环境的一种工具”（“文存”卷二，页八一）；“真理原来是人造的，是为了人造的，是人造出来供人用的，是因为他们大有用处所以才给他们‘真理’的美名的。我们所谓真理，原不过是人的一种工具……”（同上，页一○一）这就是胡适所说“假设真不真就看他能不能发生效果”的意思。
    很明显的，这种态度是完全适合于腐朽的反动的资产阶级的。当一个自然科学家在试验室中作出了某种可以提高生产力的发明时，如果在资本家看来这种发明并不能帮助他更多地发财，反而会使他因必须改置企业设备而有损失，资本家就宁愿宣布这种发明并不是“真的”。当然更不用说在资产阶级看来是不但无用，而且大大有害的关于社会发展规律的科学理论。胡适就曾用所谓“应该注意每种学说所已经发生的效果”的观点来看马克思主义的阶级斗争学说，他不问这种学说是否符合于事实，他只是说：“这种学说，太偏向申明‘阶级的自觉心’一方面，无形之中养成一种阶级的仇视心”（“文存”卷二，页一九六）。胡适觉得这种“效果”很不好，所以他就认为这种学说是不对的。
    实用主义者把这种观点叫做“科学试验室的态度”是对于科学的侮辱。自然科学家在试验室中的劳动是应该受到尊重的。马克思主义认为科学试验、科学观察是作为认识的客观标准的实践的一个必要形式。当然，人的社会实践是极为广泛的，包括生产活动和阶级斗争、政治生活、科学和艺术活动等等，不能用科学试验来概括。但必须指出，胡适的效果论和真正的科学试验并不是一回事。
    胡适在说到灵魂这种“神秘玄妙”的东西究竟有没有的时候，曾说：“既是‘神秘玄妙’，自然不能用科学试验来证明他，也不能用科学试验来驳倒他。既然如此，我们只好用实验主义的方法，看这种学说的实际效果如何，以为评判的标准。依此标准看来，信神不灭论的固然也有好人，信神灭论的也未必全是坏人。……总而言之，灵魂灭不灭的问题，于人生行为上实在没有什么重大影响；既没有实际的影响，简直可说是不成问题了。”（“文存”卷四，页一○七）这就分明地招认，所谓“看实际效果”的“实验主义方法”，并不是科学试验，而不过是反动资产阶级按照自己的卑鄙利益来颠倒是非的主观主义的方法。依照这种方法，如果不相信灵魂的人都是胡适所说的“坏人”，胡适就一定要承认灵魂不灭了。
    这种否认客观真理的资产阶级的“实用”观点，同马克思主义的实践是真理的标准的观点当然绝不是“差之毫厘”，而是根本上南辕北辙，显出了唯物主义和唯心主义的两条对立的路线。
    由此可见，胡适是为了达到反科学的目的，为了否认知识的客观性，否认客观真理，所以才把主观唯心主义的认识论引进了科学里面，对感性知识、理性知识和作为真理的标准的实践作了极大的歪曲。既然如此，当我们看到胡适在认识论问题上有时索性把经验主义的伪装也丢掉，采用了某些更直接地反科学的因素，我们是不会感到奇怪的。
    胡适在说明他对于如何研究中国文化史的意见时说：“历史家须要有两种必不可少的能力：一是精密的功力，一是高远的想像。没有精密的功力，不能做搜求和评判史料的工夫；没有高远的想像力，不能构造历史的系统”（“文存”二集卷一，页二二）。这就表示，胡适所谓“科学方法”就是一方面限制于细小的考订工作，这叫做“精密的功夫”，而在另一方面，又容许凭“想像力”来虚构历史的系统，而且认为历史系统是只能靠“想像力”来“构造”的。对于这种虚构出来的“历史系统”，寻找个别材料来“证明”，就是胡适所说的
  “大胆假设，小心求证”的“科学方法”。
    胡适又说，他的所谓“科学方法”并不同柏格森一派人所说的那种超乎经验和理性之上的“直觉”相对立。柏格森认为，只有靠这种神秘的“直觉”，人们才能认识世界的“本体”，而胡适说：“近代科学思想早已承认‘直觉’在思考上的重要位置了。”（“文存”二集卷二，页二七六）
    必须指出，虽然胡适这一派的唯心主义竭力做得同柏格森、张君勱那一派不同，但他们既然都是唯心主义，都是同唯物主义作斗争，所以他们终究还是同声相应的。胡适承认“想像力”，“直觉”认识的是基本方法，这就连所用的语言也同张君勱一流人没有什么差别了。唯心主义是科学的死敌，为了毁灭科学，一会儿用这种手段，一会儿又用那种手段，这当然是不值得奇怪的。四
    如果认为胡适派用主观唯心主义思想而加于科学的污蔑和曲解，对中国学术界没有起什么影响，是不符合事实的。
    不承认客观规律性，不承认科学的任务在于如实地认识对象的本质的这种观点，对于社会历史研究方面所起的破坏作用，是很明显的。
    社会历史的客观规律的发现对于没落的反动阶级十分不利，所以胡适派思想根本否认社会历史现象有其客观规律性；他们把个别材料的考订和对文献的校勘当做科学研究的主要内容，再加上主观的附会和武断，这就在根本上使得社会历史的研究不能够成为科学。
    接受了胡适派思想的影响，就会弄到用零碎的历史材料的考证和堆积来代替对历史的真正科学的研究，他们或者完全放弃了阐明历史规律的要求，或者只是按照自己的方便和需要而任意地“假设”和“构造”历史的规律。
    在这里，我想，还应当指出，中国自然科学界中也曾长时期地受到资产阶级唯心主义思想的影响。
    在旧中国的社会条件下，马克思主义唯物主义对自然科学界还不容易发生直接的影响。许多自然科学家往往不自觉地为资本主义世界中坏的时髦的哲学所支配，因而他们在自然科学工作中的自发的唯物主义倾向在某些方面被他们所接受的唯心主义哲学所压倒，这种情形完全是可以理解的。胡适一派人在科学界中有意识地宣传腐败哲学思想更加阻止了科学家接近马克思主义唯物主义。
    在过去的年代里，国内的自然科学方面的出版物中，凡是谈到科学理论的，可以说，绝大部分都是引述马赫、H·普恩凯莱（法国人）、K·皮耳生、J·汤姆生、罗素（均英国人）、詹姆士、杜威（均美国人）等人的议论。胡适一派人的所谓“科学的知识论”也就是从这一些欧美资产阶级的“哲学家”“科学家”那里得来的。这一些资产阶级“学者”的思想中反映着在帝国主义国家内的科学的危机，他们把主观唯心主义思想，把否定真理的客观性的观点同自然科学结合起来，这种腐朽思想在中国的影响是不应当低估的。当然，一般自然科学工作者并不是主观唯心主义思想的积极宣传者，在政治上也同胡适派不同，但他们在解释科学知识的性质，因而接触到哲学问题时，他们就常常成为唯心主义的俘虏。现在，试从手边找得到的属于科学概论性质的几本旧书中，举出若干实例。
    一九二六年，中国科学社出版了一部“科学概论”（任鸿隽著），其中讨论了科学真理的意义，并说明是根据了接近马赫学派的法国科学家普恩凯莱的见解，书中说：“科学上的真理，不是说实际是这样，而是说大家见得这样。”（页五四）又说：
  “科学的目的，在把事物的关系做一个单简的完全的无矛盾的叙述。”（页五七）因为是仅仅叙述，所以“就究极而言，科学原来不能解释什么东西”（页六一）。主观唯心主义的哲学使得自然科学家如此地丧失了对于科学知识的信心。
    一九三○年商务印书馆出版了已故的科学家王星拱著的一本“科学概论”。从这本书可以看出，作者是接受了把一切外物看做由感觉构成，而人的主体也同样由感觉组成的观点。他说：“现在的科学把许多向来所承认为客观的存体，例如时间、空间，都简约而为器官的感触，即如物质、能力也……并不是客观的实在。外而物是如此看待的，内而我又何曾不可以如此看待呢？”（见该书页二六九、二七七等处）在这里，他是根据马赫主义的主观唯心主义哲学观点来企图说明主观和客观并没有任何区别。他对于英国反动哲学家罗素的思想也表示赞赏：“……所以罗素说：心也不是实在的，物也不是实在的，只是感触才是实在的。这才真是物我一体哩。”（同上，页二七○）
    一九二九年商务印书馆出版了列入“百科小丛书”的一小册“科学概论”（已故的科学家郑太朴著），其中认为：“科学中有玄学的成分，并且是不可免的”（页一九），“这些玄学的成分或先天智识，与通常所谓用严密方法求得者不同；他是先乎我们的研究，早已存在，并为我们思想上所时刻不能离的；换言之，这种智识不是求得的，而是先存的，他不是研究之结果，而是研究之先设的基础。所以我们不能把他列在科学智识内，而视为超科学的玄学原则，并因为他是科学之基础，故名之为科学之玄学的成分”（页二○）。这本小册子所表示的态度同主观唯心主义的科学论虽有所不同，但也明显地受了另外形式的唯心主义的影响。这里承认了“先天的知识”，而且认为这种神秘的知识乃是科学的基础。这就向唯心主义做了很大的让步。
    以上这几本书可以表明唯心主义对科学的观点在中国科学界内曾经是颇有市场的。
    自然科学家如果为唯心主义哲学所俘虏，不但会使他们对周围的社会环境不可能有正确的认识（这正是反动资产阶级要在自然科学家中宣传唯心论的主要原因），而且也不能不严重妨害他们深刻地探索自然界真理的努力。
    向一切形式的毒害科学发展的资产阶级唯心主义思想作斗争，就是我们的任务。
