Editorial:

    We have a number of scientists, professors, doctors, and other scientific workers who have long been unable to concentrate on teaching and scientific research. Social activities take up much of their time. Some department heads, teaching and research group leaders, and other professors in some institutions of higher education spend about 30 percent of their annual working hours participating in social activities. The phenomenon of some scientific workers holding too many concurrent positions is also serious. Some doctors hold 22 positions concurrently, some scientists hold 13, and many professors hold 5 or 10 positions concurrently; some hold 18. The situation is roughly the same in universities and colleges in major cities. Most scientific workers with greater achievements also shoulder fairly heavy administrative duties, often spending the whole day in meetings and general administrative work. This seriously affects their professional, teaching, and research work, directly affecting the quality of teaching in universities and colleges, the quality of medical care in hospitals, and the quality of research work in scientific research institutions, and hinders the improvement of these scientific workers' academic level. This situation was reflected in the speeches of the delegates at the First Session of the First National People's Congress. The current situation has changed somewhat, but the problem has not been solved. Therefore, this is a problem that must be solved now.
   The tasks that the country's socialist construction cause places on scientific workers are arduous. In terms of economic construction, there are many technical and scientific problems that they need to solve; batches of young experts and teachers need to be trained; in addition, there are many scientific and cultural problems that need to be researched. However, China's original scientific foundation is weak, the number of scientific workers is small, and young scientific workers cannot grow up in large numbers in a short period of time. Under this situation, we must pay great attention to the rational use of scientific workers and give full play to their expertise so that limited resources can be used to do more things. This requires minimizing the social activities of scientific workers and reducing their concurrent positions and administrative work as much as possible, so that they can concentrate their energy and time on teaching and scientific research. Of course, this does not mean letting scientific workers disengage from political activities, and scientific workers should not foster a tendency to ignore politics. If so, that would be wrong. Scientific workers should and must participate in necessary social and political activities, especially various important political movements. This is needed for national construction and international cultural activities, and it is also helpful for scientific workers to connect with reality, broaden their horizons, and improve their political and ideological level. Experience over the past few years has proven that organizing intellectuals to participate in necessary social and political movements is one of the important methods to help intellectuals transform their thinking. As for letting some scientific workers hold some necessary positions concurrently and shoulder certain administrative work, this is necessary and unavoidable for practical work, whether now or in the future. But it should also be affirmed that scientific workers have their own basic tasks. The basic task of scientists is to conduct research work, and professors, in addition to teaching, and doctors, in addition to medical and preventive work, must also conduct scientific research. The achievement of scientific work and the resolution of a scientific problem cannot be achieved easily; it requires years of dedicated study. This also shows that without sufficient time, it is impossible. Therefore, the allocation of their time must be as rational as possible to ensure that they have the opportunity to complete their basic tasks.
    Many of the current social activities are arranged separately by the Party, the Communist Youth League, the democratic parties, trade unions, and other organizations, lacking unified control and rational arrangements. Scientific workers often repeatedly listen to reports of the same nature and content, and participate in meetings that lack necessary preparation, are empty of content, and are excessively long, wasting much valuable time. This is a great loss. In addition, some units often temporarily entrust scientific workers with rush work, and also ask them to do some work that they do not need to do, disrupting their original plans and causing some losses. All of these should be avoided as much as possible. Although it is difficult to completely change this situation all at once, some possible methods should be adopted to remedy those obvious defects and gradually normalize the working order and living order of scientific workers. To this end, whenever scientific workers are required to participate in activities outside their own units, unified arrangements should be made with the unit where the scientific worker is located through the local Party committee or the主管机关 (responsible authority). If a particular scientist must participate in some temporary and urgent matters, it should also be determined through consultation between the unit where the scientific worker is located and the scientist himself. If scientific workers are required to do work outside of their positions and for a relatively long period, the relevant parties should establish some necessary systems that everyone should abide by to avoid excessively affecting the professional work of scientific workers.
    To enable scientific workers to concentrate their energy on cultivating talents and scientific research, and to fully utilize their expertise, appropriate adjustments should also be made to their excessive concurrent positions. If some concurrent positions are difficult to reduce, their time and energy should also be taken into consideration, and appropriate adjustments should be made to the importance and priority of the work content. Activities that do not particularly need their participation should not invite them to participate; things that do not need them to do directly should not be allowed to do. Although these are all things that scientific workers hope for, they should still be fully consulted during the adjustment to reach a consensus. As for scientists holding concurrent positions in universities and colleges, and professors holding concurrent positions in scientific research institutions, this is generally necessary. However, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Academy of Sciences, and related research institutions should jointly agree on appropriate methods to reduce various activities that are not closely related to research work and teaching work, especially those that hinder these activities.
    The administrative work of some scientific workers appears to be heavy because, in many cases, there is a lack of necessary assistants, a lack of necessary systems, tasks are not defined clearly enough, and working methods are not scientific enough. Therefore, in order to reduce the administrative work of scientific workers, some should be equipped with deputies; some should be equipped with secretaries, both to assist them in their research work and to learn from them; some should have their tasks clearly defined to avoid them from being distracted. For example, the heads of departments in universities and colleges can be clearly instructed that, in addition to undertaking important departmental administrative work, the main task of the department heads is to lead and personally participate in teaching and scientific research work, and general routine work can be done by assistants (department secretaries, staff members, etc.). They should also be helped to establish necessary systems and improve working methods. As for some administrative work that was originally improperly assigned, it should be relieved as much as possible. This can greatly reduce their administrative work, giving them more time for teaching and scientific research.
    The problems encountered by scientific workers mentioned above are also encountered by some writers. For the excessive social activities, excessive concurrent positions, and excessive administrative work of some writers, appropriate adjustments should also be made according to the circumstances, so that they can concentrate on creative work.
    Due to the fact that we have very few scientific workers and the needs of work are multifaceted, it is inevitable that there will be more social activities during a certain period. Now is the time to make up our minds to gradually solve this problem. If we continue to delay, it will affect the development of China's scientific undertaking. Therefore, all relevant departments should overcome difficulties so that scientific workers can concentrate on professional activities and make more and greater contributions to the motherland's scientific undertaking.

    保证科学工作者集中精力于专业活动
    我们有不少科学家、教授、医生及其他科学工作者长期不能集中精力从事教学和科学研究工作。社会活动占去了他们的许多时间。有些高等学校的系主任、教研组主任以及其他一些教授，参加社会活动的时数占了他们全年工作时数的百分之三十左右。一部分科学工作者兼职过多的现象也是严重的。有的医生兼二十二职，有的科学家兼十三职，有许多教授身兼五职或十职，有的兼十八职。各大城市的高等学校，情况大致相同。成就较大的科学工作者，多半还担负着相当繁重的行政职务，常常整天忙于开会，忙于一般的事务工作。这就严重地影响了他们的业务、教学和研究工作，直接影响了高等学校的教学质量，医院的医疗质量，科学研究机关的研究工作质量，并且妨碍了这些科学工作者的学术水平的提高。这种情况在第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上，曾在代表们的发言中有所反映，现在的情况也有了某些改变，但问题并没有解决。因此，这是现在必须解决的问题。
   国家的社会主义建设事业向科学工作者提出的任务是艰巨的。在经济建设方面，有许多技术科学问题须要他们解决；成批的年轻的专家和教师须要他们培养；另外还有科学和文化方面的许多问题，须要他们研究。然而我国原有的科学基础是薄弱的，科学工作者为数不多，年轻的科学工作者又不能在短时间内大批地生长起来，在这种情况下面，必须十分注意合理地使用科学工作者，充分发挥他们的专长，以便使有限的力量，作更多的事情。这就必须尽量减少科学工作者的社会活动，并尽可能地减少他们的兼职和行政事务工作，以便使他们有可能集中精力，集中时间，从事教学和科学研究工作。当然，这决不是说要让科学工作者脱离政治活动，科学工作者也不应当滋长忽视政治的倾向。如果这样，那就错了。科学工作者应当而且必须参加必要的社会政治活动，尤其是各种重要的政治运动，这是国家建设事业所需要的，也是国际文化活动所需要的，对科学工作者联系实际，开阔眼界，提高政治思想水平也是有帮助的。几年来的经验证明，组织知识分子参加必要的社会政治运动，是帮助知识分子进行思想改造的重要方法之一。至于让一部分科学工作者兼任一些必要的职务，担负一定的行政工作，这不论在现在或在将来，都是实际工作需要的，不可避免的。但是也应当肯定，科学工作者有自己的基本任务，科学家的基本任务是进行研究工作，教授除了教学，医生除了进行医疗预防工作以外，也都要进行科学研究工作。而科学工作上的成就，某一科学问题的解决，不是轻易能够达到的，它需要经年累月的埋头钻研。这也就说明，没有足够的时间是不可能的。所以对他们的时间的分配必须力求合理，以保证他们有可能去完成自己的基本任务。
    目前的各种社会活动，不少是由党、团、各民主党派、工会等组织分头布置的，缺乏统一掌握和合理安排。科学工作者常常重复地去听同一性质同一内容的传达报告，参加缺乏必要准备和内容空泛、时间冗长的会议，浪费了许多宝贵光阴，这是很大的损失。另外还有些单位常常临时委托科学工作者作突击性的工作，而且把一些不必要让他们作的工作，也让他们去作，打乱了他们的原定计划，造成一些损失。这都是应当尽量避免的。虽然，要求一下子完全改变这种情况是困难的，但应采取一些可能的办法，弥补那些明显的缺陷，使科学工作者的工作秩序和生活秩序逐步正常化。为此，凡是要科学工作者参加本单位以外的活动，都应当通过所在地党委或主管机关同科学工作者所在单位作统一安排。部分的临时紧要的事项必须某一科学家参加的，也应当由科学工作者所在单位和他本人商洽确定。如果需要科学工作者做本岗位以外的工作，而且需要较长的期间，那就应当由有关方面确定一些必要的制度，大家共同遵守，免得过多地影响科学工作者的业务工作。
    要使科学工作者的精力能够集中于培养人才和科学研究的工作，以充分发挥他们的专长，对他们过多的兼职，也应当作适当调整。如果有些兼职难于减去，也应当照顾他们的时间和精力，在工作内容上权衡轻重主次，作适当调整。凡是不十分需要他们参加的活动，就不要请他们参加；凡是不需要他们直接去作的事情，就不要让他们去作。这虽然都是科学工作者所希望的；但在调整时，仍然应当同本人好好协商，取得一致的意见。至于科学家在高等学校兼职，教授在科学研究机关兼职，一般说都是必要的。但高等教育部、科学院以及有关研究机关应当共同商定适当的办法，减少同研究工作和教学工作关系不大的特别是妨碍这些工作的各种活动。
    有些科学工作者的行政事务工作所以显得繁重，在很多情况下是由于缺乏必要的助手，没有必要的制度，任务规定得不够明确，工作方法不够科学。因此，为了减少科学工作者的行政事务工作，有的要给他们配备副职；有的要配备秘书人员，一面协助他们进行研究工作，一面向他们学习；有的要把任务交代清楚，免得他们分散精力。例如对高等学校的系主任，就可以明白交代一下，系主任除应担负重要的系行政工作以外，主要任务是领导并亲自参加教学和科学研究工作，一般性的日常的具体工作，可以由助手（系秘书、干事等）去作。还应该帮助他们建立必要的制度，并改进工作方法。至于有些原来就分配得不恰当的行政工作，应该尽可能解除。这样就可以大大减少他们的行政事务工作，使他们有更多的时间从事教学和科学研究。
    上面所谈的科学工作者所遇到的问题，也是某些作家所遇到的问题。对于某些作家的过多的社会活动，过多的兼职，过多的行政事务工作，也应当斟酌情况，加以适当调整，使他们能够集中精力从事创作。
    由于我们的科学工作者很少，而工作的需要是多方面的，在一定的时期社会活动较多，这也是难免的。现在已经到了下定决心逐步解决这一问题的时候了，如果继续拖延下去，就会影响我国科学事业的发展。所以各有关部门应当排除困难，使科学工作者能够集中精力于专业活动，为祖国的科学事业作出更多更大的贡献。
