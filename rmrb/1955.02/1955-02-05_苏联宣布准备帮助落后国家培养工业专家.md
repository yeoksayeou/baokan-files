Xinhua News Agency, New York, 3rd. According to TASS, the United Nations Consultative Committee on Raw Material Trade has been meeting in New York since January 17th, with representatives from seventeen countries participating. This committee was established at the request of underdeveloped countries, which are concerned about the adverse impact of the current raw material market conditions on their economies.

The Soviet representative, Kosciukhin, spoke at the meeting on January 31st. He pointed out that it is necessary to develop local raw material processing industries in underdeveloped countries to promote their industrial development, increase their exports, and reduce unemployment. The Soviet Union suggested that the committee study these issues. The Soviet delegation is authorized to declare that the Soviet Union is ready to help underdeveloped countries train experts in the raw material processing industry, and this expense will be allocated from the funds that the Soviet Union has given to the United Nations Expanded Technical Assistance Program.

The US representative refused to participate in the work of the committee, which shows that US monopoly capital is concerned with maintaining the current chaos in raw material prices on the world market.

    苏联宣布准备帮助落后国家培养工业专家
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国原料贸易咨询委员会自一月十七日起在纽约开会，参加会议的有十七个国家的代表。这个委员会是根据落后国家的要求建立的，它们对目前原料市场状况对它们经济的不利影响感到不安。
    苏联代表科斯丘克欣在一月三十一日的会议上发言。他指出，必须在落后国家中发展原料加工的地方工业，以促进这些国家的工业发展，增加它们的输出和减少失业现象。苏联建议委员会研究这些问题。苏联代表团受权声明，苏联准备帮助落后国家培养原料加工工业专家，这笔费用将由苏联交给联合国扩大技术援助计划的基金中拨出。
    美国代表拒绝参加委员会的工作，这表明美国垄断资本关心的是保持目前世界原料市场上价格的混乱。
