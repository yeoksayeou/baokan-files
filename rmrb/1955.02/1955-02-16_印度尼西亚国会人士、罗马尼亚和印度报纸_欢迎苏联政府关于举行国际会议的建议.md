    Indonesian Parliamentarians, Romanian and Indian Newspapers Welcome Soviet Government's Proposal for International Conference

    [Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 15th] Mois, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the Indonesian Parliament, told an Antara News Agency reporter on the 14th that the Soviet proposal to hold a ten-nation conference on the Taiwan issue might very well be a good idea.

    [Xinhua News Agency, February 14th] Romanian News Agency, Bucharest, February 13th: Romanian newspapers have successively published the Soviet proposal to convene a conference to discuss the Taiwan area issue. The newspapers emphasized that the Soviet proposal conforms to the people's firm demands and is the most reliable way to solve the Taiwan issue. "Scânteia" wrote that public opinion points out that, as in other cases, whenever a threat of war arises, it is always the Soviet Union that takes the initiative to find ways to resolve differences peacefully. "Scânteia" said that the Romanian people, along with other peace-loving people, welcome this new Soviet initiative and express their hope that this proposal will be welcomed by the governments of all relevant countries. This is the will of the people, which no government can ignore.

    [Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 15th] The Urdu daily "Al-Jamiat" published an editorial on the 15th commenting on the Soviet proposal to convene an international conference to discuss the Taiwan issue, saying, "We feel that in the current situation, Russia's proposal is reasonable, and the proposed ten-nation conference would be helpful."

    The "Hindustan Standard" on the 14th said in an editorial commenting on the Taiwan issue that the U.S. Navy has no legitimate reason to enter Chinese waters. "It seems that old-fashioned gunboat diplomacy has now put on the cloak of some kind of moral responsibility for ideological reasons."

    The editorial also pointed out that the reason a solution to the Taiwan issue cannot be arranged in an acceptable way is "mainly due to the United States' refusal to recognize the changes that have taken place in China and its active assistance to the plans of the impostor who has been driven away."

    The editorial pointed out, "The fact that the legitimate Chinese government is in complete control of mainland China must be taken into account. Any Chinese government—regardless of its political orientation—will strongly oppose threats to its territorial integrity and displays of force."

    The editorial said: "Attacks on the Chinese mainland are continuing from the positions occupied by the Kuomintang, and these attacks are receiving the tacit approval and assistance of the United States." The editorial asked, "How would the United States feel if China and the Soviet Union established a 'defense' circle in Long Island and placed the opposing American regime under its wing?"

    The editorial concluded that no plan regarding the future of Taiwan will help maintain peace in the Far East unless the United States and its allies permanently cease supporting the rebel Chiang Kai-shek group.

    印度尼西亚国会人士、罗马尼亚和印度报纸
    欢迎苏联政府关于举行国际会议的建议
    【新华社雅加达十五日电】印度尼西亚国会外交小组委员会主席莫伊斯十四日告诉安塔拉通讯社记者说，苏联建议举行关于台湾问题的十国会议也许很可以说是个好主意。
    【新华社十四日讯】罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特十三日讯：罗马尼亚各报纷纷刊载苏联所提出的关于召开会议讨论台湾地区问题的建议。各报着重指出，苏联的建议符合人民的坚决要求，并且是解决台湾问题的最可靠的办法。“火花报”写道，公众舆论指出：这和其他情况一样，每当战争威胁来到时，总是苏联采取主动，设法以和平方式解决分歧。“火花报”说，罗马尼亚人民和其他爱好和平的人民一道，欢迎苏联这个新的主动，并且表示，希望这个建议得到一切有关国家政府的欢迎。这是人民的意愿，是任何政府所不能忽视的。
    【新华社新德里十五日电】乌尔都文日报“光荣报”十五日发表社论评论苏联关于召开国际会议讨论台湾问题的建议说，“我们觉得在目前的情况下，俄国的建议是合理的，建议中的十国会议是会有帮助的。”
    十四日的“印度斯坦旗报”在评论台湾问题的社论中说，美国海军没有任何合法理由进入中国海面。“看来，旧式的炮舰外交现在已经以思想理由，披上了某种道义责任的外衣。”
    社论又指出，所以不能安排出可以被接受的解决台湾问题的方案，“这主要是由于美国拒绝承认在中国发生的变化，并且积极帮助已经被赶走的冒牌货的计划”。
    社论指出，“合法的中国政府完全控制着中国大陆，这个事实必须加以考虑。任何中国政府——不管它的政治面貌如何——都将强烈反对侵犯它的领土完整的威胁和显示武力的行动。”
    社论说：“从国民党占据的阵地对中国大陆的攻击在继续进行，这些攻击是得到美国的私下赞同和帮助的。”社论问道，“如果中国和苏联在长岛设立一个‘防御’圈，而置对立的美国政权于它的卵翼下，美国会觉得怎么样”。
    社论最后说，没有任何关于台湾前途的方案会对维持远东的和平有所帮助，除非美国和它的盟国永远停止扶植叛逆的蒋介石集团。
