Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 22nd: According to the Indian Information Bureau: Indian President Dr. Rajendra Prasad delivered a speech at the Parliamentary Budget Meeting on February 21st.

　　In his speech, Prasad reviewed India's foreign relations over the past year. He said that India's relations with all other countries remain friendly, and understanding and cooperation with many of them have been growing. Prasad said, "I would like to make special mention of the agreement between China and India on Tibet. This agreement affirms the friendship between these two great nations, which is extremely important for peace in Asia and the world. This agreement establishes certain principles that can be applied more broadly. Many other countries have also recognized that these principles can be promoted. The five principles, which we sometimes call 'Panchsheel' (note: this is Hindi, meaning five principles), are mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity and sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. I introduce these principles to you and sincerely believe that they will increasingly become the basis of international relations, thereby ensuring peace and security throughout the world."

　　Prasad said that the Asian-African Conference "marks another stage in the development of countries on these two continents and their participation in world affairs. I am sure that it will bring greater understanding and cooperation to these countries and promote the cause of world peace."

　　Prasad said, "In the past year, truly, since the end of the Second World War, the prominent event was the Geneva Conference, which led to the end of the Indochina War and laid the foundation for a peaceful resolution of the problems of the Indochinese countries. The Geneva Conference dealt with very important and difficult issues, but the efforts of the countries concerned to seek a peaceful solution were finally successful. Therefore, the conference has set an example, and I hope that this example can be followed in the future to resolve other international disputes and conflicts."

　　Regarding the situation in the Taiwan region, Prasad said, "Our government only recognizes one Chinese government, which is the People's Republic, and believes that the demands of this republic are legitimate. But I sincerely hope that these difficult problems will be resolved peacefully and through negotiations."

　　Prasad expressed his hope for a complete ban on the production of nuclear weapons and the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes.

    印度总统谈和平共处五项原则和台湾局势
    【新华社新德里二十二日电】据印度新闻处消息：印度共和国总统普拉沙德博士二十一日在国会预算会议上发表演说。
    普拉沙德在演说中回顾了印度一年来的对外关系。他说，印度同所有其他国家的关系仍然是友好的，而且同其中许多国家的了解和合作一直在增长。普拉沙德说，“我愿意特别提一提中国和印度关于西藏的协定。这个协定肯定了这两个伟大的国家的友谊，这种友谊对亚洲和世界和平极为重要。在这个协定中，确定了某些原则，这些原则是可以更广泛地应用的。许多其他国家也已承认这些原则是可以推广的。我们有时称之为‘潘奇雪拉’（按：这是印地文，意思就是五项原则）的五项原则就是互相尊重彼此领土完整和主权，互不侵犯，互不干涉内政，平等互利和和平共处。我把这些原则介绍给你们并衷心相信，它们将愈来愈成为国际关系的基础，从而保证全世界的和平和安全。”
    普拉沙德说，亚非会议“标志着这两个大陆上的国家的发展和它们参与世界事务过程中的另一阶段。我确信，它一定会替这些国家带来更大的谅解和合作，并促进世界和平事业”。
    普拉沙德说，“过去一年中，实在说来是第二次世界大战结束以来，突出的事件是促使印度支那战争结束和为和平解决印度支那各国的问题奠定基础的日内瓦会议。日内瓦会议处理的是非常重要和困难的问题，但是有关各国寻求和平解决的努力，终于得到了成功。因此，会议就树立了榜样，我希望在今后能仿效这个榜样来解决其他国际争端和冲突。”
    普拉沙德在谈到台湾地区的局势时说，“我国的政府只承认一个中国政府，那就是人民共和国，并认为这个共和国的要求是正当的。但是我真诚希望，这些困难的问题将会和平地和通过谈判方式得到解决。”
    普拉沙德表示希望完全禁止生产核子武器，并且把原子能用于和平的目的。
