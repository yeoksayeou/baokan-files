Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd: A “Restoration of Diplomatic Relations Month” movement, launched by the Japanese public to demand the restoration of diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union, began on the 20th.

The “Restoration of Diplomatic Relations Month” was initiated by the Japanese National Council for the Restoration of Diplomatic Relations with China and the Soviet Union, and is supported by sixty organizations, including the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan-Soviet Union Friendship Association, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, the All-Japan Federation of Women's Organizations, and the Greater Japan Fisheries Association.

During the "Restoration of Diplomatic Relations Month," four conferences on issues such as diplomacy and fisheries will be held in Tokyo; at the same time, county-level conferences demanding the restoration of diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union will be held across the country, and activities such as screening Soviet films will be conducted.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 22nd: Japanese economic figures, commenting on the issuance of new Renminbi by the State Council of the People's Republic of China, believe that this measure demonstrates that the Chinese government has laid a solid and consolidated foundation in politics and economics.

In a statement, Hidezo Inaba, Chairman of the Japan National Economy Research Association, pointed out that the issuance of new Renminbi is the implementation of reducing the face value of banknotes. The reason the Chinese government can take this measure at this time is because its foundation has been consolidated.

Shinji Ishiguro, Managing Director of Eiwa Trading Co., Ltd., said: "This shows that China's 'national strength has a new foundation, so it is important news.'"

According to Kyodo News, Japanese trade circles attach great importance to the measure of issuing new Renminbi by China from March 1st. They believe that this measure is due to the stability of China's domestic economy. They are also optimistic about the prospect of more stable Japan-China trade.

    【新华社二十二日讯】东京消息：日本经济界人士在评论中华人民共和国国务院发行新的人民币时认为：这个措施表明了中国政府在政治和经济上奠定了坚实和巩固的基础。
    日本国民经济研究协会理事长稻叶秀三发表谈话指出：发行新的人民币是实行缩小票面金额。中国政府所以能在这时候采取这一措施，是因为它的基础已经巩固了。
    永和商事公司常务董事石黑信二说：这表明中国的“国家力量有了新的基础，所以是重要的消息。”
    据共同社报道，日本贸易界人士非常重视中国从三月一日起发行新的人民币的措施。他们认为采取这个措施是由于中国国内经济稳定。他们并且对日中贸易更趋稳定的前景表示乐观。
