    Ice Eggs
    Yú Guǎn
    The seasonal nature of egg production is very pronounced. During the harsh winter and early summer months, as well as the hot summer, production invariably declines sharply. Eggs are also not easy to store and preserve, making it difficult to keep peak season products for sale during the off-season. With the improvement of people's living standards, the need for eggs for consumption in rural and urban areas has generally increased. In addition, the output of chickens and eggs decreased in some flood-affected areas in 1954, so the current situation of supply falling short of demand in the egg market is even more prominent.

    To adjust the needs of large cities and industrial and mining areas, state-owned food companies allocated 1,400 tons of Grade One ice eggs from their inventory to the market around the Spring Festival this year. In the future, during the egg production off-season, state-owned food companies will continue to allocate a certain amount of ice eggs to meet market needs.

    Ice eggs are processed egg products. The eggs used to make ice eggs are all Grade One fresh eggs selected according to national commodity inspection standards. The hygiene requirements are extremely strict during processing. Utensils used from the opening of fresh eggs to stirring, filling, and freezing are thoroughly disinfected. Any eggs with peculiar smells are not filled. After filling, they are frozen in a freezing room at minus 20 degrees Celsius for 70 hours to become ice eggs, and stored in a cold storage at minus 15 degrees Celsius. Ice eggs, after scientific and meticulous processing, do not have any impurities or unsanitary substances mixed in, so their quality and nutritional content are the same as fresh eggs, without any change.

    Processing fresh eggs into ice eggs requires removing eggshells, membranes, runny whites, and other waste products and losses. Therefore, producing one jin of ice eggs requires 1.21 jin of fresh eggs. In addition to the loss portion, one jin of ice eggs is actually equivalent to 1.15 jin of fresh eggs. The finished product weighs 44 pounds and 22 pounds per barrel.

    Barrelled ice eggs are most suitable for food factories, institutions, organizations, troops, schools, and other collective catering units, because these units can use or consume one or more barrels of ice eggs at a time. Even if they are not used up, they can be stored in a cold room or refrigerator (or outdoors in winter). Buying in barrels makes it easy to carry and transport, unlike fresh eggs which can be damaged. Moreover, when purchasing fresh eggs in large quantities, there are always some eggs of inferior quality mixed in, while ice eggs are made entirely of high-quality eggs.

    After buying ice eggs, just cut off a piece of appropriate size and put it in a bowl. It will thaw at a temperature above 0 degrees Celsius, just like freshly opened fresh eggs. Except for not being able to boil or fry whole eggs, other cooking methods such as stir-frying, steaming, or making soup are the same as cooking fresh eggs, and the taste is the same.

    Families or individuals who consume small amounts can buy ice eggs by the jin or liang. If you can't finish it at once, it will not deteriorate at temperatures below minus 4 degrees Celsius. But be careful not to let it continuously freeze and thaw, then thaw and freeze.

    冰蛋

    鸡蛋生产的季节性很强，在冬末夏初的严寒季节和炎热的夏季，产量照例是要锐减的。鸡蛋又不易储存保管，很难把旺季的产品保留到淡季销售。随着人民生活的提高，农村和城市对鸡蛋的食用需要普遍增加，加上一九五四年部分水灾地区鸡和鸡蛋的产量减少，所以目前市场上鸡蛋供不应求的情况更显得突出。
    为了调剂大城市和工矿区的需要，国营食品公司在今年春节前后，把库存一号冰蛋拨出一千四百吨供应市场。今后，在鸡蛋生产的淡季里，国营食品公司还将继续拨出一定数量的冰蛋供应市场需要。
    冰蛋是鸡蛋的制成品。制造冰蛋所用的鸡蛋，都是按照国家商品检验规格选出的一级新鲜鸡蛋。在加工过程中，对卫生条件要求极严，由把新鲜鸡蛋打开到搅拌、灌筒、冷冻各个环节的用具都是经过彻底消毒的。发现有异味的就不灌筒。灌筒以后，在摄氏零下二十度的冷冻间冷冻七十小时，即成为冰蛋，保存在摄氏零下十五度的冷藏库里。冰蛋经过科学的、细致的加工，没有任何杂质或不洁物掺杂在里面，所以它的品质和营养成份和新鲜鸡蛋一样，毫无变化。
    用新鲜鸡蛋加工冰蛋，需要去掉蛋皮、蛋膜、流青等废品和损耗，所以制成一斤冰蛋，需要一点二一斤新鲜鸡蛋，其中除损耗部分外，实际上一斤冰蛋相当于一点一五斤新鲜鸡蛋。制成品每筒重量分为四十四磅和二十二磅。
    筒装冰蛋对食品工厂和机关、团体、部队、学校等集体伙食单位最为适用。因为这些单位一次就可以使用或食用一筒或一筒以上的冰蛋。即便是用不完，还可以放在冷室或冰箱里保存（冬季放在露天里即可）。成桶购买时，便于携带搬运，不像新鲜鸡蛋会发生破损。而且大批购买新鲜鸡蛋，总不免有品质较次的掺杂在里面，冰蛋则完全是品质优良的鸡蛋制成的。
    买来冰蛋，只要切下适当大小的一块放在碗里，在摄氏零度以上就会化开，和刚刚打开的新鲜鸡蛋一样，除去不能整个的煮吃或煎荷包蛋外，其他如炒吃、蒸吃或做汤等，都和烹调新鲜鸡蛋的做法相同，味道一样。
    家庭或个人食用量不大的，可以论斤论两购买冰蛋，如果一次吃不完，在摄氏零下四度的温度以下，是不会变质的。但应注意不要让它连续地冻了又化、化了又冻。
