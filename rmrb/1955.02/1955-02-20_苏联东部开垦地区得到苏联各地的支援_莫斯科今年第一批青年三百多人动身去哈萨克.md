    The Soviet Eastern Reclamation Area Receives Support from All Parts of the Soviet Union
    First Group of Over 300 Young People from Moscow Sets Off for Kazakhstan This Year
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th] The spring reclamation and sowing work in the Soviet Eastern Reclamation Area is about to begin, and various agricultural machines are being continuously transported from all over the country to the state farms and machine tractor stations there. Before the start of spring sowing, the state farms there will receive a total of thousands of tractors, nearly 18,000 five-bottom plows specially designed for reclaiming wasteland, more than 75,000 seeders and other machines, as well as 7,000 automobiles and 750 mobile power stations. This year, machine tractor stations will receive more than 30,000 tractors and a large number of seeders, combine harvesters, and other machines.
    In order to help the large-scale housing construction work in the Soviet eastern and southeastern reclamation areas, factories under the Soviet Ministry of Building Materials Industry are transporting various building materials. This year, they will transport prefabricated houses with a total area of 280,000 square meters and thousands of sets of house components. In addition, preparations are being made to supply the newly established state farms and machine tractor stations with hundreds of thousands of tons of cement, more than one million square meters of window glass, 55,000 square meters of facing tiles, and a large amount of slate and other building materials. Workers in the locomotive depots of the West-South Railway Line of the Ukrainian Republic will assemble a large number of carriage dormitories for agricultural laborers in the reclamation areas of Kazakhstan and the Altai Territory this year.
    Trade organizations of consumer cooperatives have transported a large number of food and industrial products to the reclamation areas. In the first half of this year, the consumer cooperative system will open 350 prefabricated stores, 350 canteens, and many small mobile stores there.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 19th] According to TASS Moscow: Five thousand agronomists, soil scientists, and land management personnel under the leadership of the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of State Farms surveyed a total of 150 million hectares (1 hectare equals 15 Chinese mu) of wasteland in the eastern and southeastern regions of the Soviet Union in 1954. They have selected 34.6 million hectares of fertile virgin land for planting crops. Among them, 20 million hectares of land can be sown this spring.
    The survey of wasteland will continue this year.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 19th] The first group of more than 300 young men and women from Moscow to go to the southeastern reclamation area of the Soviet Union this year departed for Kazakhstan on February 17.
    This group of young people includes lathe operators, grinders, and mechanics from the Second Tractor and Electrical Equipment Factory; and calculators and fractionators from the Balakirev Factory. Pilyagin, who had just returned from the army, and his wife, Alexandra, participated in this endeavor with their three-month-old child.
    More than a thousand Muscovites gathered at the Kazan Railway Station to see off their comrades and children. This station, which has already sent tens of thousands of Moscow youth to support the great reclamation undertaking, was filled with a joyful atmosphere. The band played music, and loud songs echoed everywhere. More than a dozen couples were dancing the waltz to the rhythm.
    A brief meeting was held on the platform of the station. Pavlov, Secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the Soviet Leninist Communist Youth League, spoke. Then, female technician Orenovskaya and electrical fitter Rukhovtsev also spoke. They wanted the people of Moscow to believe that they would definitely complete the glorious task assigned to them by the Party and the government.
    As the train slowly pulled out of the station, the songs and farewells of "Comrades, have a safe journey" lingered for a long time.
