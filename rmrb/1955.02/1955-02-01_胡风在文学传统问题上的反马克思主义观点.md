    In his "Explanatory Materials on Several Theoretical Issues," Hu Feng reiterates many of his views from the 1940 debate on "National Forms." These views constitute an important part of Hu Feng's so-called "realism" theory. It is important because it involves not only the Marxist aesthetic principle of national form but also conceals, deep within this issue, the attitude towards the classical Chinese literary tradition, thereby relating to the general principles of realist literary theory. The fundamental difference in attitude towards this issue can basically reveal the essence of Hu Feng's anti-Marxist literary thought.

    In his report at the First Congress of Chinese National Literary and Art Workers in 1949, Mao Dun summarized the various biases in the 1940 debate on "National Forms": "The various thoughts expressed in this debate included some that simplified the issue of popularization to merely using 'old folk forms' (the so-called 'old wine in new bottles'), to the point of completely obliterating all the new literary forms since the May Fourth Movement. Others, under the guise of defending 'new literary forms,' clung to the small world of petty-bourgeois literature and art—defending the 'form,' but actually fearing that the content hidden under this form would be harmed." Hu Feng was a representative of the latter ideological tendency. Hu Feng's so-called "defending the revolutionary literary tradition of the May Fourth Movement" was actually upholding a nihilistic attitude that negated national forms and the classical literary tradition. Fourteen years later, Hu Feng not only has not changed his previous erroneous understanding of this issue but has also intensified his attempts to use some "Marxist" terms to create sensationalist arguments in order to dazzle readers and achieve his goal of negating national forms and the classical literary tradition. Here, we will only raise a few points of criticism regarding the latter issue.

    Regarding the evaluation of China's cultural heritage (including literary heritage) and how to inherit and accept this heritage, Chairman Mao has given us scientific instructions. He said: "In the history of the Chinese nation's civilization, there has been highly developed agriculture and handicrafts, many great thinkers, scientists, inventors, politicians, military strategists, writers, and artists, and a rich collection of cultural classics. ... China is one of the earliest countries in the world to develop civilization, and China has a written history of nearly four thousand years." "The Chinese nation is also a nation with a glorious revolutionary tradition and an excellent historical heritage." Because "China's long feudal society created a brilliant ancient culture," "cleaning up the development process of ancient culture, removing its feudal dross, and absorbing its democratic essence are necessary conditions for developing a new national culture and enhancing national self-confidence." But this is not "uncritically embracing everything," but rather "it is necessary to distinguish between all the corrupt things of the ancient feudal ruling class and the excellent people's culture of ancient times, which is somewhat democratic and revolutionary." This is the attitude of "respecting one's own history" that a new Chinese cultural worker should have. Obviously, Chairman Mao is using Lenin's scientific principle of two cultures here; Lenin said: "In every national culture there are two national cultures. There is the Greater Russian culture of the Purishkeviches, the Guchkovs, and the Struves—but there is also the Greater Russian culture represented by Chernyshevsky and Plekhanov. There are two such cultures in the Ukraine, just as there are two such cultures in Germany, France, England, and among the Jews." Chairman Mao applied Lenin's principles to specifically analyze the cultural tradition of the Chinese nation, correctly guiding us on how to treat the classical cultural heritage from a fundamental perspective.

    Hu Feng's attitude in the "National Form" debate was precisely the opposite of this principle. In his "On the Issue of National Form," he collectively refers to both the literary and artistic works of the "purely feudal ideology" in feudal society and the "self-creation of the oppressed and exploited masses," regardless of their content differences, as "feudal literature and art." Hu Feng believes that in this "feudal literature and art" (folk literature and art), "it is even difficult for us to find reflections of even slightly democratic viewpoints." According to his analysis, this is because before the May Fourth Movement, Chinese society "objectively did not have the existence of democratic reality, and subjectively did not have democratic fighting viewpoints. Their grievances, troubles, pains, sorrows, doubts, resistance, demands, dreams... could only rush around within feudal consciousness, just like flies seeking light bumping against glass windows; not only could they not enable those 'motives of resistance' to obtain a reasonable 'destination,' but they also could not enable the actual content of those resistances to reveal their true image under the illumination of historical truth, and therefore feudal literature and art could no longer develop forward." This not only negates China's classical cultural heritage but, according to Hu Feng's understanding, the resistance and struggles of the masses of the people in our country for thousands of years seem to have never promoted historical progress, have not formed the "revolutionary tradition" of "loving freedom" and "being unable to tolerate the rule of dark forces" that Chairman Mao spoke of, the people were just carrying "primitive spontaneity" and blindly "fighting" pitifully like "flies" in "chaotic" history. This completely overturns the basic Marxist principle that the masses of the people are, and only the masses of the people are, the creators and promoters of history. Isn't this obviously negating the classical cultural heritage and national nihilism that belittles the combat achievements of the ancient working people? The entire history of China is the most powerful evidence to refute this argument, and it can completely judge its absurdity. However, today, Hu Feng still believes that the "several basic contents" in his "On the Issue of National Form" are still "correct." And he has "found" so-called "theoretical" "basis" from Marxist classic works to embellish and emphasize them. Now let us take a look at Hu Feng's theoretical basis!

    What serves as Hu Feng's "theoretical basis" is the term "national culture." Hu Feng believes that Lenin's doctrine of two cultures refers to "two cultures of the nation," not "two cultures in a class society." With this premise, Hu Feng goes in circles on the concept of "nation." He cites Stalin's definition of the category of "nation": "A nation is not an ordinary historical category, but a historical category of a certain era, namely the era of the rise of capitalism. The process of eliminating feudalism and developing capitalism is also the process of people forming into a nation." From this, he believes that "in the process of the bourgeois revolution,... a culture that opposes bourgeois nationalism, a systematic culture of democracy and socialism, is produced." Thus, he concludes that the progressive culture in the two cultures referred to by Lenin is this "systematic culture of democracy and socialism." Extending this, he reaches the conclusion that before the May Fourth Movement in China, the "civil society" had not "emerged," there was no process of bourgeois revolution, so it was impossible to form a "nation," and of course, there was even less talk of a progressive cultural heritage. Here, Hu Feng's ignorance of Chinese history is completely exposed, he fundamentally denies the formation of the Chinese nation before the May Fourth Movement, denies the proletariat's leadership of the May Fourth Movement, and Lenin's formulation cannot defend Hu Feng's "national culture" theory.

    In the same article by Lenin that Hu Feng quotes regarding the two cultures, there is also this passage: "In every national culture, there are democratic and socialist cultural components, even if they are not very developed, because in every nation there are laboring and exploited masses, and their living conditions inevitably produce democratic and socialist ideological systems." Obviously, the "national culture" mentioned by Lenin here inherently contains the meaning of the two cultures of class society. The so-called "in every nation there are laboring and exploited masses" here cannot be encompassed by the bourgeoisie and the proletariat as limited by Hu Feng. When Lenin talked about the bourgeois democratic revolution, he also mentioned that the masses of the people in feudal society, mainly the peasant class, are more "able to become completely and the most radically supportive of the democratic revolution forces" than the bourgeoisie in the democratic revolution process. And the history of China's feudal society for thousands of years, as Chairman Mao said: "Peasant uprisings and peasant wars are the real driving force of historical development." Hu Feng just cannot see a bit of democratic power in the peasants, but completely bows down to the democratic power of the citizens. Although the peasants themselves cannot create any historical change without new productive forces, new relations of production, and new class forces, their opposition to the exploitation and oppression of the feudal rulers and their demands for seizing the land of the landlords will inevitably produce an ideology that opposes the superstructure of feudal society. In order to conform to his own views, Hu Feng wants to quibble on the concept of "national culture," obliterate the method of class analysis, to negate the precious tradition of our country's excellent national heritage, absolutely separate concepts such as "national form" and "national cultural heritage," and emphasize the so-called "systematic" "progressive culture," but in fact, he has not been able to save his theory, but has instead fallen deeper into the "chaotic" quagmire.

    Now let us look at the "correct" degree of Hu Feng's "several basic contents" from the discussion of specific issues.

    First, regarding the issue of classical literary heritage. In addition to "On the Issue of National Form," Hu Feng has a total of three articles in his collection of essays that specifically discuss the issue of literary heritage. However, the "heritage" he talks about are all works by Western European writers, completely unrelated to China's classical literary heritage. Occasionally touching on China's classical literary heritage, he mechanically emphasizes "content determines form." In his mind, Chinese classical literature was produced in feudal society, so China only has "feudal literature and art" and "no people's literature and art," of course, it does not count as heritage, so there is no need to talk about the issue of inheritance. Such arguments can easily be discovered to be wrong. Therefore, in this "Explanatory Materials on Several Theoretical Issues," Hu Feng also has to hypocritically admit Chairman Mao's evaluation of Chinese classical culture: "Our ancestors created a brilliant ancient culture." But Hu Feng quickly explains: "This brilliance is a historical content, a class and era nature expressed through ideology, a defined, limited historical content. This brilliance is a historical content in which the people's content and the meaning of people have not been liberated by the ideas of the democratic revolution, and have not been illuminated by the light of the democratic revolution. In this brilliant ancient culture, there are certainly some 'essences' that express our ancestors' dreams and pursuits as human beings, but there are many more of our ancestors' cruel 'wisdom' as rulers and the 'morality' of accepting fate as those ruled, more of this vast amount of 'dross' that, although created by our ancestors, has suppressed our ancestors." After such a big detour, through the distortion of Chairman Mao's instructions, he is still repeating the old tune that Chinese ancient culture only has dross and no essence. Confusing the rulers and the people, confusing the real essence and dross of ancient culture, and even including feudal ideology in the creations of our people to rebuke. Under such theoretical principles, criticizing and cleaning up ancient culture is not a "necessary condition for developing a new national culture and enhancing national self-confidence," but only for making "ideological materials." Isn't Hu Feng's arrogant and conceited attitude towards our working ancestors and the cultural heritage they created, and his belittling himself, "holding a 'nihilistic view of national culture'"?

    When theory touches on specific issues, it becomes more obvious and blatant. Hu Feng believes that before the "madman" in Lu Xun's "Diary of a Madman," there was not a single active character in Chinese classical literature; Sun Wukong in Journey to the West is just a toy created by the author "purely with imagination," not a literary type at all, the same as Investiture of the Gods; even in the greatest realist work reflecting the peasant war, Water Margin, you cannot hear "the rebellious sound from a disloyal heart"; even in the works before Dream of the Red Chamber, "women are either the embodiment of sex, or the embodiment of feudal morality, or at best the embodiment of a simple rebellious concept." This is the "essence" conclusion that Hu Feng has drawn from Chinese classical literature through the process of "criticism" and "cleaning up." Obviously, the study of Chinese classical literature and the issue of critically accepting excellent heritage are nothing more than playing the role of decorating the facade in Hu Feng's theoretical system, using it to swindle and deceive. What he negates is the whole, what he affirms is "nihilism." Under the guidance of such a theory, our work of critically accepting heritage, and our work of studying classical literature, will of course be thrown into the "cold palace" as a matter of course in Hu Feng's plan to transform the literary and art circles as a "recommendation for reference." Look at the seat that our classical literature occupies in Hu Feng's plan!

    "Regarding Chinese classical literature, another appropriate institution should publish a research and discussion publication with a limited print run (three to five thousand copies), preferably mainly distributed in a pre-determined manner by general researchers and research institutions. Comprehensive publications will then publish works that are considered good, or invite researchers to write special articles. Comprehensive publications will not accept submissions from this department."

    To put it simply, the essence of this suggestion is to fundamentally stifle the work of classical literature research, and fundamentally cancel the principle of popularizing cultural heritage to the broad masses of the people. Research work here is not to allow the people to correctly understand and appreciate classical literature, but to accommodate a few "researchers" as "antiques" to decorate the literary and art circles. This is the "pattern" that Hu Feng designed for the work of classical literature research in New China. Thousands of years of excellent literary heritage are thus imprisoned in Hu Feng's theoretical prison.

    However, Marxists are completely opposed to Hu Feng. We are very proud that our nation has its own rich treasure trove of literary heritage, which has created a "unique, outstanding style that expresses the psychology and customs of the people, and is therefore accustomed and loved by the people." From the Book of Songs and Chu Ci to Water Margin, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West, Dream of the Red Chamber, and The Scholars, the brilliant tradition of realism has been developing, always shining with immortal brilliance. It exerts a moving charm among the broad masses of the people. They have a high degree of artistic skill, rich, beautiful, and vivid language, and have created countless unforgettable artistic types. Putting these classical literary heritages side by side with the world's great works is also without shame. Therefore, these heritages, which are rich in the people's character but are regarded as "feudal literature and art" by Hu Feng, are not like Hu Feng predicted that they "only have the prospect of death" and are only "relying on 'historical inertia' to exert its power" in the minds of the broad masses of the people in New China. On the contrary, Chinese classical literary works, just like what Lenin said when discussing Tolstoy's works: "Can be cherished and read forever by the masses when they overthrow the oppression of landlords and capitalists and create conditions for themselves to live a human life." The writers of New China who love the motherland are also taking a road opposite to Hu Feng. They will never abandon these excellent national heritages, but seriously learn and critically inherit their valuable traditions to better create and develop the people's literature.

    Second, regarding the issue of the revolutionary literary tradition of the May Fourth Movement. Hu Feng admitted in the "Explanatory Materials" that the past "formulation of the leading ideology of the May Fourth at that time was wrong, and violated Chairman Mao's analysis and conclusion." However, superficial admission does not equal substantial admission: and it definitely does not mean that he has corrected his mistakes. Hu Feng's evaluation of the revolutionary literary tradition of the May Fourth Movement is not as he boasted, that in addition to the formulation of the leading ideology, the "several basic contents" are still "not wrong." Because Hu Feng analyzes specific issues under the overall understanding of the May Fourth Movement. Since there is no clear understanding of this major historical key, it is impossible to have a correct analysis of the specific content of this movement. This series of issues are closely related to each other, and it is necessary to briefly describe them.

    Hu Feng's evaluation of the historical essence of the revolutionary literary tradition of the May Fourth Movement completely violates Marxism. He believes that "the May Fourth literary revolutionary movement of the Chinese people with citizens (bourgeoisie—author) as the allies is precisely a newly expanded tributary of the world's progressive literary and art tradition after the emergence of civil society, accumulated for hundreds of years." The "basis or 'internal basis'" of this new literature is only "living social relations," and there is no "existing Chinese literary form as an internal basis." Therefore, under the premise of severing the relationship between form and content and making them absolutely opposed, it is concluded that the new literature has nothing to do with the realist literary tradition of our nation, and "the May Fourth new literature has obtained a completely different and brand-new posture from feudal literature and art (should be regarded as the people's literature including the realist tradition of classical literature—author)." Therefore, Hu Feng believes that "it is right to say that it 'draws a huge gap with the inherent literary tradition of China'."

    However, Marxism believes that the principle that content determines form does not mean fundamentally denying form at all. There is no such social development law that falls from the sky, and therefore there can be no sudden change in cultural form without internal causes. Hu Feng is good at confusing right and wrong by literally interpreting Lenin's doctrine of two cultures, "confusing" Lenin's class viewpoint of analyzing national culture, limiting it to the scope of his own subjective purpose, but forgetting that Lenin also clearly said: "Proletarian culture is not falling from the sky, nor is it conjured up by those who call themselves experts in proletarian culture. If you think so, that's nonsense. Proletarian culture should be the inevitable result of the development of the sum of knowledge created by mankind under the oppression of capitalist society, landlord society, and bureaucratic society." Chairman Mao also said: "The new politics and new economy in China at present have developed from the old politics and old economy in ancient times, and the new culture in China at present has also developed from the old culture in ancient times. Therefore, we must respect our own history and never sever history." We cannot see what points of commonality this scientific historical materialism principle has with Hu Feng's theoretical system.

    Because of this, great classical realist works in Chinese history such as Water Margin, Dream of the Red Chamber, The Scholars, as well as great poets Qu Yuan and Du Fu, have gained a correct understanding and played the new significance and vitality of these works under the analysis and criticism of Marxist viewpoints. And in order to achieve the negation of the literary tradition, Hu Feng, under the guise of affirming the literary tradition of the May Fourth Movement, does not hesitate to close his eyes and completely negates the things that the May Fourth Movement once affirmed—the greatest works of the realist tradition of classical literature such as Water Margin and Dream of the Red Chamber. He believes that new literature "is not only opposed to classical literature, but also opposed to folk literature," which is naturally because they are all "feudal literature and art." Hu Feng admits that in Western Europe there are "various realist literary and art tendencies that resist the feudal tradition," but he completely negates our nation's progressive literary tradition under the accusation of "single stream theory," cuts off the inherent connection that must objectively exist between the new literature and our nation's progressive traditional literature, and establishes his "multi-stream theory." In essence, this "multi-stream theory" is precisely a deformed version of the real "single stream theory," which is the central idea of the foreign influx theory. According to this understanding, "the new literary and art demands a 'leap' that is completely different from the forms that existed before it,... it demands the transfer of forms (and methods) from other nations with similar social foundations." Look! Hu Feng, who mechanically emphasizes that content determines form and therefore despises form, has changed again into a blind worshiper of foreign forms, regarding form as a "magic weapon" and becoming a devout believer in formalism that is detached from content.

    Yes, Chairman Mao also said: "China should absorb a large amount of foreign progressive culture as raw materials for its own cultural food" (please Hu Feng pay attention that it is only raw materials). But he also said: "All foreign things, like our food, must be chewed through our own mouths and stomachs, sent into saliva, gastric juice, and intestinal juice, decomposed into essence and dross, and then excreted its dross and absorbed its essence, so that it can be beneficial to our body, and it must never be swallowed raw and uncritically absorbed." This conclusion has nothing in common with Hu Feng's claim that forms (and methods) can be transferred from "other nations with similar social foundations."

    It can be seen that Hu Feng, who claims to be a Marxist, does not truly understand, or even fundamentally understand, Marxist historical materialism, and therefore cannot solve the relationship between the revolutionary literature of the May Fourth Movement and the realist tradition of Chinese classical literature, as well as the relationship with foreign progressive literature. He can only use the form influx theory of vulgar sociology to replace and distort Marxism.

    No matter how Hu Feng’s influx of "literature," is not "a general Western European literature and art," but various "naturally growing emerging literature and art" "from the point of view of democratic requirements," it is impossible to "transfer" it. Because on any issue, "the so-called 'complete Westernization' claim is a wrong viewpoint."

    Therefore, Hu Feng's sophistical question: "Does Comrade Lin Mohan and Comrade He Qifang think that Mao Zedong Thought inherited and carried forward the 'excellent traditions' of 'national philosophy'?" cannot explain anything. The application of universal Marxist truths in China has nothing to do with Hu Feng's literary influx theory. History has proven that many people who wanted to mechanically hard-set Marxism as a formula on the Chinese revolution have played the ugly role of dogmatism. Regarding this issue, Chairman Mao once clearly pointed out: "In the capitalist era, especially in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, the mutual influence and mutual stimulation of various countries in politics, economy, and culture are extremely huge. The October Socialist Revolution not only created a new era in Russian history, but also created a new era in world history, affecting changes within various countries in the world, and similarly and especially profoundly affecting changes within China, but these changes are caused by the internal laws of various countries and China." And "Chinese communists... must completely and appropriately unify the universal truth of Marxism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, that is, combine it with national characteristics and pass through certain national forms to be useful." But Hu Feng denies that there are any national forms in China before the May Fourth Movement. In Hu Feng's tyrannical questioning, he not only exposed the absurdity of his literary views, but also exposed his wrong attitude towards Marxism. According to his understanding, Marxism was not "transferred" to China mechanically and without any changes through special combination paths, which only proves his own ignorance of Marxism and cannot explain anything. Similarly, denying that Chinese literature has its own development laws, denying that Chinese classical literature has its own realist tradition and national forms, and advocating what is called a "completely different sudden leap," is denying "the laws of literary history," which has nothing in common with Marxist literary viewpoints.

    Those who hold this "complete Westernization" point of view of the "influx theory" and "cling to the small world of petty-bourgeois literature and art under the guise of defending 'new literary forms'" can neither recognize the great achievements of revolutionary literature since the May Fourth Movement, nor can they recognize the serious shortcomings existing in this literature, and therefore cannot make a correct evaluation. Hu Feng believes that "the development of the content of literary popularization or mass literature, converging with the development of the new realist theory since the May Fourth Movement and the development of the artistic cognitive methods accumulated by progressive creative activities, the internal connection of these three aspects forms the tradition of the new literature of the May Fourth Movement, the tradition of realism. From this, it can be known that popularization cannot be separated from the tradition of the May Fourth Movement, because it must always obey the requirements of realism to reflect life and criticize life, and the tradition of the May Fourth Movement cannot be extracted from popularization, because it is essentially tending towards the combination with the masses." This means that the revolutionary literature since the May Fourth Movement was originally 100% perfect, and therefore the suspicion of "Westernized literary forms" is also a fabrication of Mr. "Mo Xu You," and the discussion of the issue of national form has become superfluous. Extending this, it means that there were no problems in the new literature itself since the May Fourth Movement, and the direction of the new literature determined by Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" was completely unnecessary. In this way, it is no wonder that Hu Feng also "let it be printed separately in its original form" in 1947 "On the Issue of National Form," and happily comforted himself by saying: "After the publication of this article, no one continued the discussion of this issue, and it became a state of no inspiration and no germination," as if he had made a "brilliant" conclusion to this issue. If Hu Feng is not closing his eyes, then he has other intentions. Because everyone knows that some serious shortcomings and principled issues in the new literature since the May Fourth Movement, including the issue of national form, were not truly scientifically summarized and pointed out in the correct direction until Chairman Mao's 1942 "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." The broad masses of literary and art workers have also followed this direction to carry out practice, and therefore have obtained the flowers of people's literature in the past ten years, while Hu Feng was still singing his platitudes in 1947.

    The Marxist understanding of the new literary tradition of the May Fourth Movement is completely opposite to Hu Feng's assertion. The main trend of the new literature of the May Fourth Movement played a huge role in anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism, especially in opposing feudal literature and opposing classical Chinese. Although the leading thought of the new literature of the May Fourth Movement was under the leadership and influence of proletarian thought, there were also serious shortcomings within the new literary and art ranks, such as the attitude towards the literary tradition which was once wrong. Chairman Mao once pointed out: "But the May Fourth Movement itself also had shortcomings. Many leading figures at that time did not yet have the critical spirit of Marxism, and the methods they used were generally bourgeois methods, that is, formalist methods. They opposed the old eight-legged essay and old dogmas, and advocated science and democracy, which was very correct. But they did not have the critical spirit of historical materialism towards the status quo, towards history, and towards foreign affairs. The so-called bad is absolutely bad, everything is bad; the so-called good is absolutely good, everything is good. This method of looking at problems formalistically affected the development of this movement later." This shortcoming of looking at problems formalistically is even more prominent in the negative attitude towards the national literary heritage, while Hu Feng not only regards this mistake as a treasure, but also develops it into a systematic theory, using the "knife" of "influx theory" to cut off the connection between the revolutionary literature of the May Fourth Movement and the Chinese realist literary tradition, completely falling into the quagmire of anti-Marxism. Incidentally, belittling or even negating the national literary heritage is one of the theoretical characteristics of the RAPP faction. Therefore, it is not wrong to say that Hu Feng "fell into the quagmire of the 'theory' of the RAPP."

    Third, related to this issue, is Lu Xun, the "greatest and most heroic standard-bearer of the new cultural army,"’s creation, "national" or "influx"? There are two different answers to this question.

    Hu Feng believes that "those representative fighting writers, such as Lu Xun in novels, Guo Moruo, Kang Baiqing, and the Lakeside Poets in poetry, etc., for the requirements of a revolutionary spirit of breakthrough in content, also adopted a brand-new unprecedented posture in form, and the form and content correspondingly set off a stormy, great revolution." "Lu Xun's novel form was 'transplanted' from Europe, which is completely new to Chinese old novels. Lu Xun's essays, prose, prose poems, etc., are created by transforming similar forms of European literature, which are unprecedented in China."

    However, we have a different view from Hu Feng. Anyone who is familiar with the Chinese classical literary tradition, especially the novel tradition, after reading Lu Xun's novels, will not only find that he has been influenced by European literature, but more importantly, that he has inherited and carried forward the tradition in Chinese classical novels, and has carried forward the characteristics of the national form of Chinese classical novels even more in the "depth of expression" and "special format." Putting aside Hu Feng's so-called "national form" (that is, language), Lu Xun's novels inherit the characteristics of Chinese classical novels' tight, simple, and complete structure, the "finishing touch" writing method, the ink painting-like background rendering, the outline of characters' white drawing techniques, and the ability to use characters' actions and dialogues to express characters' psychology without the method of static psychological analysis, which is completely the traditional characteristic of Chinese novels, and has the characteristics of Chinese style and Chinese style that are popular with the Chinese people. Mr. Lu Xun himself never denied this. He advocated using white drawing techniques to write characters, "to draw a person's characteristics in an extremely frugal way, it is best to draw his eyes," and when creating types, he can "mix and take various people to form one,... this method is also in line with the habits of the Chinese people. For example, painters paint characters, they also observe silently, become familiar with them, and then concentrate and think, and complete it in one stroke. They have never used a single model." Mr. Lu Xun's novels are "gradually breaking away from the influence of foreign writers" and striving to grasp the national style. Therefore, his novels are becoming more and more popular with the broad masses of the people.

    At the same time, Hu Feng also believes that Lu Xun did not advocate accepting the Chinese classical literary heritage. Of course, this point is not explicitly raised, but it is distorted in the case of firm denial. Hu Feng said: "Lu Xun consistently angrily opposed the theory of national revivalism that regarded new literature as 'inheriting and carrying forward the national literary tradition' (? Author) throughout his life. For example, in 'Books that Young People Must Read,' 'Written Behind "Grave,"' etc., he said the 'truth exchanged for much pain' with extreme poignancy. He even regarded reading ancient books and being a 'living person' as mutually exclusive things. He earnestly hoped that young people would not bear the 'ancient soul, unable to get rid of it.' Before his death, he also relentlessly fought against the national revivalist thoughts of Lin Yutang, Shi Zhecun, Wen Zhigong, and Liu Bannong, etc." But when Lu Xun put forward these propositions, it was to emphasize that young people should face the struggle of real life and not be led to the piles of ancient books by the "national essence" and "national past" masters, and not take the national revivalist road of Hu Shi and others. At the same time, what Mr. Lu Xun opposed was the harmful and useless "national essence," not the "literary heritage." On the contrary, Mr. Lu Xun truly advocated critically accepting cultural heritage. When he talked about the "exploration of new forms," he said: "We have an art history, and since we are born in China, we must open the Chinese art history. What should we adopt? I think, we have no way to see the true works before the Tang Dynasty, but we can still know that the themes are roughly based on stories, which can be taken as a model; in the Tang Dynasty, we can take the brilliance of Buddhist paintings, the emptiness and clarity of lines; the court paintings of the Song Dynasty should be discarded for their weakness and gentleness, and the meticulousness is acceptable; the rice dot landscape paintings are useless. I dare not say for sure at this moment whether the later freehand brushwork paintings (literati paintings) are useless. I am afraid that there may still be some points that can be used. These adoptions are not miscellaneous arrays of fragmented antiques. They must be dissolved in new works, which is not necessary to say. It is just like eating cattle and sheep, discarding their hooves and hair, and retaining their essence to nourish and develop new organisms. It will never be 'like' cattle and sheep because of this." And he also clearly pointed out the inevitability of this inherited relationship: "The time when art was thought to be the explosion of the artist's 'inspiration,' like a person whose nose itches, and as long as he sneezes, he will feel comfortable all over, has passed. Now I think of, and care about the masses. This is a new idea (content), and from this, we are exploring new forms. The first thing that is proposed is the adoption of old forms. This advocacy of adoption is the beginning of new forms, which is also the transformation of old forms. In my opinion, it is neither mechanically separating content and form, nor is it seeing 'sister flowers' called popular, so I also come to learn a set of opportunistic crimes." (Emphasis added by the author)

    Here, Mr. Lu Xun not only advocated accepting the classical cultural heritage, pointed out what to accept, how to accept, and the purpose of acceptance, but also clearly pointed out the inevitability of the inherited relationship that Hu Feng hated the most. Does this also count as a national revivalist? What reason does Hu Feng have to extract fragmentary words and deliberately confuse right and wrong to make Mr. Lu Xun also play the role of a denier of cultural heritage?

    It can be seen that Hu Feng has made incorrect interpretations of Mr. Lu Xun's works and theories, and his purpose is to defend his own wrong theories.

    Through a simple analysis of these three issues, it can be seen that the "several basic contents" of Hu Feng in the issue of national form are not "still not wrong," but fundamentally violate Marxist viewpoints.

    In his speech at the enlarged joint meeting of the Presidium of the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association, Hu Feng repeatedly accused the Literary Gazette of making the mistake of "forming a vulgar sociological ideological front," and gave a definition of vulgar sociology: "What is vulgar sociology? The basic characteristic is not starting from reality, not understanding reality with the guidance of principles, but replacing reality with principles, starting from fixed concepts, or even starting from messy concepts, and using Marxist terms or policy terms to judge works." Putting aside his "ulterior motives," it should be said that this definition does not truly express the content of vulgar sociology, while Hu Feng's own theory truly embodies the content of vulgar sociology.

    Hu Feng's so-called "new literature and art demands a sudden leap that is completely different from the forms that existed before it" is to regard literature, one of the social ideologies, as equivalent to the general superstructure (political power, law, etc.). Once the foundation changes, the literary form must also undergo a "sudden leap that is completely different," cutting off contact with tradition and becoming a negation of tradition. This is a typical vulgar mechanical understanding of the foundation and superstructure. The master of this mechanical theory, Friche, understood literature and explained the history of European literature in this way. In fact, this is a complete negation of "the laws of literary history." In class society, although the culture of the ruling class is the "ruling culture," it does not include all the ideological consciousness of society. Because "in every national culture, there are democratic and socialist cultural components, even if they are not very developed, because in every nation there are laboring and exploited masses, and their living conditions inevitably produce democratic and socialist ideological systems." (Lenin) This ideology lives in the form of glorious traditions, and the new force must rely on this glorious tradition to seek development, and thus the issue of heritage arises. This is the correct conclusion that Marxism has made on the issue of heritage from the perspective of class analysis. Hu Feng's nihilistic attitude towards China's classical heritage is precisely the lack of this class analysis method, the vulgar understanding of the relationship between the superstructure and the foundation, and thus the realistic tradition of Chinese classical literature is also included in "feudal literature and art" and negated.

    Hu Feng's so-called new literature and art "requires the transfer of forms (and methods) from other nations with similar social foundations." is to understand literature, which is one of the social ideologies, as not being national, not having national characteristics, and any nation can arbitrarily "transfer forms (and methods) from other nations with similar social foundations."

    胡风在文学传统问题上的反马克思主义观点
    李希凡　蓝翎
    胡风在“关于几个理论性问题的说明材料”中，又重复叙述了他在一九四○年“民族形式”论争时的许多见解。这些见解构成胡风所谓的“现实主义”的理论的一个重要部分。它之所以重要，是因为它所涉及到的并不只是民族形式这一马克思主义的美学原则问题，而是在这一问题的深处还隐蔽着对待中国古典文学传统的态度问题，从而联系到现实主义文学理论的一般原则问题，从对待这一问题的不同态度上，基本上可以判明胡风的反马克思主义的文艺思想的实质。
    茅盾在一九四九年中华全国文学艺术工作者第一次代表大会上的报告中，总结到一九四○年“民族形式”问题论争中的各种偏向时说：“表现在这论争中的各种思想，有的是把大众化问题简单化到只是‘民间旧形式’的利用（所谓“旧瓶装新酒”），以至完全抹煞了五四以来的一切新文艺的形式，也有的在保卫‘文艺新形式’的名义下坚守着小资产阶级文艺的小天地——其所保卫的是‘形式’，实际上是深恐藏在这种形式下的内容受到损害。”而胡风就是后一种思想倾向的代表者。胡风所谓“保卫五四的革命文学传统”，实际上却是坚持着否定民族形式，否定古典文学传统的虚无主义态度。十四年后的今天，胡风不仅丝毫没有改变以前对这一问题的错误理解，而且更变本加厉地企图用一些“马克思主义”的词句，制造耸人听闻的论调，以期眩惑读者，达到其否定民族形式，否定古典文学传统的目的。在这里，我们仅就后一问题提出几点批驳的意见。
    关于中国文化遗产（包括文学遗产）的估价，以及如何去继承接受这一遗产的问题，毛主席已经给了我们科学的指示。他说：“在中华民族的开化史上，有素称发达的农业和手工业，有许多伟大的思想家、科学家、发明家、政治家、军事家、文学家和艺术家，有丰富的文化典籍。……中国是世界文明发达最早的国家之一，中国已有了将近四千年的有文字可考的历史。”“中华民族又是一个有光荣的革命传统和优秀的历史遗产的民族”〔一〕。正因为“中国的长期封建社会中，创造了灿烂的古代文化”〔二〕，所以“清理古代文化的发展过程，剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华，是发展民族新文化提高民族自信心的必要条件”〔三〕。但这也并不是“无批判地兼收并蓄”，而是“必须将古代封建统治阶级的一切腐朽的东西和古代优秀的人民文化即多少带有民主性和革命性的东西区别开来。”〔四〕这就是一个新中国文化工作者应该具有的“尊重自己的历史”的态度。显然，毛主席在这里是运用了列宁的关于两种文化的科学原则；列宁是这样说的：“在每一种民族文化中都有两种民族文化。有普里什克维奇辈、古契可夫辈和司徒卢威辈的大俄罗斯文化，——然而也有以车尔尼雪夫斯基和普列哈诺夫为代表的大俄罗斯文化。在乌克兰也有这样的两种文化，正如在德国、法国、英国和在犹太人那里也有这样的两种文化一样”〔五〕。毛主席运用列宁的原则，具体地分析了中华民族的文化传统，从根本问题上正确地指导了我们如何对待古典文化遗产的问题。
    胡风在“民族形式”问题论争中所持的态度，恰恰是这一原则的反对面。他在“论民族形式问题”里，将封建社会里“纯粹的封建意识形态”的文艺，和“被压迫被剥削的人民大众底自己创作”等等，不问其内容的差别，统称之为“封建文艺”。胡风认为这种“封建文艺”（民间文艺）中，“甚至略略带有民主主义观点底要素底反映也很难被我们发现”〔六〕。根据他的分析，这是因为“五四”以前的中国社会，“客观上既没有民主主义的现实存在，主观上又没有民主主义的战斗观点。他们底不平、烦恼、苦痛、忧伤、怀疑、反抗、要求、梦想……就只有在封建意识里面横冲直撞，恰像追求光明的苍蝇乱碰在玻璃窗子里面；不但不能使那些‘反抗的动因’得到合理的‘归宿’，而且也不能使那些反抗的实际内容在历史真理底照明下面呈露出真像，因而封建文艺再也不能向前发展了。”〔七〕这里不仅否定了我国古典文化遗产，而且依照胡风的理解，我们祖国几千年来的人民群众的反抗和斗争，似乎从来没有推动历史的进步，没有形成像毛主席所说的“酷爱自由”“不能忍受黑暗势力的统治”的“革命传统”〔八〕，人民只是带着“原始的自发性”，盲目地在“混乱”的历史中，像“苍蝇”一样可悲地“搏斗”着。这就完全推翻了人民群众、而且只有人民群众才是历史的创造者、推动者这一基本的马克思主义的原则。这难道还不是明显地否定古典文化遗产，以及轻视古代劳动人民的战斗业绩的民族虚无主义吗？全部中国历史，就是反驳这种论调最有力的证据，而且完全可以判定其荒谬。但是，在今天，胡风却仍然认为他的“论民族形式问题”中的“几个基本内容”，还是“正确的”。并且又从马克思主义经典著作中，“找来了”所谓“理论性的”“根据”，加以粉饰和强调。现在我们就来看一看胡风的理论根据吧！
    作为胡风“理论根据”的，就是“民族文化”这个术语问题。胡风认为，列宁的关于两种文化的学说，所指的是“两种民族的文化”，而不是“阶级社会里的两种文化”。在这样的前提下，胡风就在“民族”这个概念上兜开了圈子。他引证了斯大林关于“民族”这一范畴的界说：“民族不是普通的历史范畴，而是一定时代即资本主义上升时代的历史范畴。封建制度消灭和资本主义发展的过程同时就是人们形成为民族的过程。”〔九〕由此而认为“在资产阶级革命过程中，……产生了和资产阶级民族主义对立的一种文化，体系性的民主主义和社会主义的文化。”〔一○〕因而断定，列宁所指的两种文化中的进步文化，就是这种“体系性的民主主义和社会主义的文化”。引伸下去，就达到这样的结论，中国“五四”以前，“市民社会”还没有“突起”，没有资产阶级革命过程，也就不可能形成“民族”，当然就更谈不到进步的文化遗产了。在这里，完全暴露了胡风对于中国历史的无知，他根本否认“五四”以前中华民族的形成，否认无产阶级领导五四运动，列宁的提法是不能为胡风的“民族文化”说作辩护的。
    在胡风引证的列宁两种文化的提法的同一篇文章内，还有这样一段话：“每个民族文化里面，都有哪怕是不大发展的民主主义的和社会主义的文化成份，因为每个民族里面都有劳动的和被剥削的群众，他们的生活条件必然地要产生民主主义的和社会主义的思想体系。”很显然，列宁在这里所讲的“民族文化”里面，本质上就包含着阶级社会的两种文化的意义。这里所谓的“每个民族里面都有劳动的和被剥削的群众”，并不是胡风限定的资产阶级和无产阶级所能囊括的，列宁在谈到资产阶级民主革命时，也曾谈到过，封建社会里的人民群众，主要是农民阶级，在民主革命过程中，较之资产阶级，更“能成为完全和最急进拥护民主革命的力量。”〔一一〕而中国几千年来的封建社会的历史，正如毛主席所说：“农民的起义和农民的战争，才是历史发展的真正动力。”胡风恰恰在农民身上看不到一点民主力量，而完全拜倒在市民的民主力量前面。虽然农民在没有新的生产力、新的生产关系，新的阶级力量的情况下，他们本身不能造成任何历史转变，但他们反对封建统治者的剥削和压迫，和夺取地主土地的要求，却必然会产生和封建社会上层建筑相对立的意识形态。胡风为了符合他自己的见解，想在“民族文化”概念上进行诡辩，抹煞阶级分析的方法，以否定我国优秀民族遗产的宝贵传统，把“民族形式”、“民族文化遗产”等概念绝对地区分开，强调所谓“体系性的”“进步文化”，实际上并没有能挽救他的理论，反而使他更掉进了“混乱”的泥坑里去了。
    现在我们再从对具体问题的探讨，来看一看胡风的“几个基本内容”的“正确”程度。
    第一，关于古典文学遗产的问题。胡风在他的论文集中，除“论民族形式问题”外，共有三篇专门讨论文学遗产问题的文章。然而，他所讲的“遗产”，都是西欧的文学作家的作品，完全与中国古典文学遗产无关。偶一触及到中国古典文学遗产时，就机械地强调“内容决定形式”。在他的心目中，中国古典文学是产生在封建社会，所以中国只有“封建文艺”“没有人民的文艺”，当然不算遗产，因而也就不必谈到继承的问题。这样的论调，在目前很容易被人发觉他的错误。于是，胡风在这次“关于几个理论性问题的说明材料”里，也不得不虚伪地承认毛主席对中国古典文化的评价：“我们的祖先创造了灿烂的古代文化”。但胡风却又赶忙解释：“这个灿烂性，是一个历史性的内容，是一个阶级性和时代性通过意识形态所表现出来的，被规定了的、被限制了的历史性的内容。这个灿烂性，是人民内容和人底意义还没有被民主革命的思想所解放出来，没有被民主革命的光所照亮出来的历史性的内容。在这个灿烂的古代文化里面，固然包含有表现了我们祖先底作为人的梦想和追求的一些‘精华’，但更多更多的却是我们祖先底作为治人者的残酷的‘智慧’和作为治于人者的安命的‘道德’，更多的是这种汗牛充栋的，虽然是我们祖先创造出来的但却又压死了我们祖先的‘糟粕’。”〔一二〕转了这样一个大弯子，通过对毛主席指示的曲解，仍然是重复了中国古代文化只有糟粕没有精华的老调。将统治者和人民，将古代文化真正的精华与糟粕“混乱”起来，甚至将封建的意识形态也归入我们人民的创造中去加以斥责。在这样的理论原则之下，批判和清理古代文化，就不是为了“发展民族新文化提高民族自信心的必要条件”，而只是为了做“思想材料”。胡风这种对待我们的劳动祖先及其所创造的文化遗产狂妄傲慢、妄自菲薄的态度，难道还不是“抱的‘对民族文化的虚无主义观点’”吗？
    理论接触到具体的问题，就表现的更加明显而露骨。胡风认为，在鲁迅“狂人日记”中的“狂人”以前，中国古典文学里，没有一个主动的人物；西游记中的孙悟空，也只是作者“仅仅用想像力”创造出来的玩艺，不是什么文学的典型，与封神榜是一样的东西；就是在最伟大的反映农民战争的现实主义作品“水浒”里，也听不到“发自贰心的叛逆之音”；甚至在红楼梦“以前的作品里面，女性，要么是性底化身，要么是封建道德底化身，顶好的也是一种单纯的反抗观念底化身。”〔一三〕这就是胡风通过“批判”和“清理”过程，从中国古典文学中得出来的“精华”结论。很显然的，研究中国古典文学，和批判接受优秀遗产问题，在胡风这种理论体系里，无非是扮演着装饰门面的“颜色”，借此招摇撞骗而已。他所否定的是全体，他所肯定的是“虚无”。在这样的理论指导下，我们的批判接受遗产工作，我们的古典文学研究工作，在胡风的“作为参考的建议”的改造文艺界的计划里，当然是理所必然地被打入“冷宫”。看看我们的古典文学在胡风计划中所占的席位吧！
    “关于中国古典文学，另由适当机构出版一限定印数（三、五千份）的研究讨论刊物，顶好主要由一般研究者和研究机构预定的方式发行。综合性刊物认为好的作品再加以发表，或约请研究者写专文。综合性刊物不接受这一部门的投稿。”〔一四〕
    说得简单一点，这建议的实质，就是从根本上扼杀古典文学研究工作，从根本上取消将文化遗产普及到广大人民中去的原则，研究工作在这里不是为了让人民正确地认识和欣赏古典文学，而是为了容纳少数“研究者”，作装饰文艺界的“古玩”。这就是胡风在新中国给古典文学研究工作所设计的“图案”，几千年来的优秀文学遗产，就这样被囚进了胡风的理论监牢。
    但是，马克思主义者和胡风完全相反。我们很自豪，我们的民族有着自己丰富的文学遗产的宝藏，它们创造了民族的“独特的，卓越的，表现了人民的心理和风习的，因而为人民所习惯和喜爱的风格”。从诗经、楚辞到水浒、三国演义、西游记、红楼梦、儒林外史，一直发展着现实主义的光辉传统，始终闪耀着不朽的光芒。在广大人民中间发挥着感人的魅力。它们具有着高度的艺术技巧，丰富、优美、生动的语言，创造了无数令人难忘的艺术典型。把这些古典文学遗产并列在世界的伟大作品里，也是毫无愧色的。因此，这些富有人民性的然而却被胡风当作“封建文艺”的遗产，在新中国，在广大人民的心目中，并不像胡风所预言的“只有死灭的前途”，只是“依靠着‘历史的惰性’在发挥它底威力。”〔一五〕而恰恰相反，中国古典文学作品，正像列宁论托尔斯泰的作品时所说的：“可供大众在推翻了地主与资本家的压迫而为自己创造人的生活条件的时候永远珍视和阅读”〔一六〕。热爱祖国的新中国的作家们，也和胡风走着相反的道路，他们对这些优秀的民族遗产，绝不是弃而不顾，而是认真地学习和批判继承其宝贵传统，更好地创造和发展人民的文学。
    第二，关于“五四”革命文学传统问题。胡风在“说明材料”中承认了过去“对于五四当时的领导思想的提法是错误的，是违反了毛主席的分析和结论的。”但是，表面上的承认，并不等于实质上的承认：也绝不等于已经纠正了自己的错误。胡风对“五四”革命文学传统的评价，并不像他自吹自擂地那样，除了领导思想的提法以外，“几个基本内容”，还“是没有错误的”。因为胡风是在对“五四”的总的理解下，来分析具体问题的。既然对于这一重大的历史关键，没有明确的认识，也就根本谈不到对这一运动的具体内容能有正确的分析。这一系列的问题是互相密切联系着的，有必要简单地叙述一下。
    胡风对“五四”革命文学传统的历史性的实质的评价，是完全违反马克思主义的。他认为“以市民（资产阶级—笔者）为盟主的中国人民大众底五·四文学革命运动，正是市民社会突起了以后的、累积了几百年的、世界进步文艺传统底一个新拓的支流。”这个新文学“作为基础或‘内在根据’的”，仅仅“是活的社会诸关系”，而没有“当作内在根据的中华民族现有文艺形式”〔一七〕。因此，在割裂形式和内容的关系并使之绝对对立的前提下，就断定了新文学与我们民族的现实主义文学传统毫无关系，“五·四新文艺由这获得了和封建文艺（应该看作包括古典文学的现实主义传统在内的人民的文艺——笔者）截然异质的、崭新的姿态”〔一八〕。所以，胡风认为“说它‘和中国固有的文学传统划着一道巨大的鸿沟’”是对的〔一九〕。
    但是，马克思主义却认为，内容决定形式的原则，绝不等于根本否认形式。世界上没有这样一种凭空而降的社会发展规律，因而也就不可能有没有内因的文化形式突变论。胡风善于以对列宁关于两种文化学说的字面解释来混淆是非，“混乱”了列宁分析民族文化的阶级观点，把它限定在自己主观目的的范围内，却忘记了列宁还曾经明确地说过：“无产阶级文化并不是从空中掉下来的，也不是那些自命为无产阶级文化专家的人所臆想出来的。如果认为这样，那就是胡说八道了。无产阶级文化应当是人类在资本主义社会、地主社会、官僚社会压迫下所创造出来的知识总汇发展底必然结果。”〔二○〕毛主席也曾经说过：“中国现时的新政治新经济是从古代的旧政治旧经济发展而来的，中国现时的新文化也是从古代的旧文化发展而来，因此，我们必须尊重自己的历史，决不能割断历史。”〔二一〕我们看不出，这种科学的历史唯物论原则，和胡风的理论体系有什么共同之点。
      正因如此，中国历史上伟大的古典现实主义作品像水浒、红楼梦、儒林外史、以及伟大的诗人屈原、杜甫等，在马克思主义观点的分析批判下获得了对它们的正确的理解和发挥了这些作品的新的意义和生命力。而胡风为了达到对文学传统的否定，在肯定“五四”文学传统的幌子下，不惜闭着眼睛，把“五四”所曾经肯定过的东西——古典文学的现实主义传统中最伟大的作品水浒、红楼梦等，也彻底否定了。他认为新文艺“不仅和古文对立，而且也和民间文艺对立”，这自然因为它们都是“封建文艺”。胡风承认在西欧有“和封建传统反抗的各种倾向的现实主义文艺”，而却以“单流论”的罪名，完全否定我们民族的进步文学传统，割断了新文学与我们民族进步的传统文学在客观上必然存在着的内在联系，建立他的“多流论”。实质上这“多流论”正是真正的“单流论”的变形，是外国流入论的中心思想。按照这种理解，“新的文艺要求和先它存在的形式截然异质的突起的‘飞跃’，……它要求从社会基础相类似的其他民族移入形式（以及方法）”〔二二〕。看！机械地强调内容决定形式并因而轻视形式的胡风，在这里又一变而为外国形式的盲目崇拜者了，把形式看成了“万能法宝”，成了脱离内容的唯形式论的虔诚信徒。
    是的，毛主席也曾说过：“中国应该大量吸收外国的进步文化，作为自己文化食粮的原料”〔二三〕（请胡风注意只是原料）。但也曾说过：“一切外国的东西，如同我们对于食物一样，必须经过自己的口腔咀嚼和胃肠运动，送进唾液胃液肠液，把它分解为精华和糟粕两部分，然后排泄其糟粕，吸收其精华，才能对我们的身体有益，决不能生吞活剥地毫无批判地吸收。”〔二四〕这结论和胡风所主张的可以从“社会基础相类似的其他民族移入形式（以及方法）”的说法是没有共同之点的。
    由此可见，自命为马克思主义者的胡风，并不真正懂得，甚至根本不懂得马克思主义的历史唯物论，因而也就不可能解决“五四”革命文学和中国古典文学的现实主义传统，以及和外国进步文学的关系问题。只有用庸俗社会学的形式移入论，来代替和歪曲马克思主义。
    不管胡风的这种移入“文学”，“不是笼统的西欧文艺”，而是“在民主要求的观点上”，各种“自然生长的新兴文艺”，都是不可能“移入”的。因为在任何问题上，“所谓‘全盘西化’的主张，乃是一种错误的观点。”
    因此，胡风诡辩地质问：“难道林默涵何其芳同志以为毛泽东思想是继承并发扬了‘民族哲学’底‘优良的传统’的吗？”是不能说明什么问题的。马克思主义普遍真理在中国的运用和胡风的文学移入论是毫不相干的。历史已经证明，许多想生吞活剥把马克思主义当作公式硬套在中国革命头上的人们，都扮演了教条主义的丑角。关于这一问题，毛主席曾经明确地指出过：“在资本主义时代，特别是在帝国主义和无产阶级革命的时代，各国在政治上、经济上和文化上的互相影响和互相激动，是极其巨大的。十月社会主义革命不只是开创了俄国历史的新纪元，而且开创了世界历史的新纪元，影响到世界各国内部的变化，同样地而且还特别深刻地影响到中国内部的变化，但是这种变化是通过了各国内部和中国内部自己的规律性而起的。”〔二五〕而“中国共产主义者……必须将马克思主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践完全地恰当地统一起来，就是说，和民族的特点相结合，经过一定的民族形式，才有用处”〔二六〕。但胡风却否认“五四”以前中国有什么民族形式。在胡风这种蛮横的质问中，不仅暴露了他的文学见解的荒谬，而且也暴露了他对马克思主义的错误态度。按照他的理解，马克思主义不是通过特殊的结合的道路，而是机械地原封不动地“移入”到中国来的，这除了证明他自己对于马克思主义的无知外，是说明不了什么的。同样地，否认中国文学有它自己的发展规律，否认中国古典文学有它自己的现实主义传统及民族形式，而提倡什么“截然异质的突起的飞跃”，就是否认“文艺史底法则”，这与马克思主义的文学观点，是毫无共同之处的。
    持着这种“全盘西化”的“移入论”的观点，“在保卫‘文艺新形式’的名义下坚守着小资产阶级文艺的小天地”的人，既不可能认识“五四”以来革命文学的巨大成就，也不可能认识这个文学中存在着的严重缺点，因而也就不可能作出正确的评价。胡风认为，“文艺大众化或大众文艺底内容底这一个发展，汇合着五·四以来的新的现实主义理论底发展和进步的创作活动所累积起来的艺术的认识方法底发展，这三方面底内的关联就形成了五·四新文艺底传统，现实主义的传统。从这里就可以知道，大众化不能脱离五·四传统，因为它始终要服从现实主义的反映生活、批判生活底要求，五·四传统也不能抽去大众化，因为它本质上是趋向着和大众的结合。”〔二七〕这也就是说，“五四”以来的革命文学，本来是百分之百完美无缺的，因而“欧化的文艺形式”受到的怀疑，也是“莫须有”先生的臆造，民族形式问题的讨论，也就变成多余的了。引伸下去，就是“五四”以来新文艺本身并没有存在什么问题，毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”所确定的新文艺的方向，也是完全没有必要的。这样，就怨不得胡风在一九四七年还把“论民族形式问题”“让它照原样子单独地印了出来”，并且欣欣然自慰地说：“本文发表以后，又再没有谁继续这个问题底讨论，成了没有启发也没有生发的状态”〔二八〕，仿佛他给这一问题作了“光辉”的结论。如果不是胡风闭着眼睛，就是他别有企图。因为谁都知道，“五四”以来新文艺存在着的一些严重缺点和原则问题，连民族形式问题也包括在内，是直到毛主席一九四二年的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中，才得到了真正科学的总结，并指出了正确的方向。广大的文艺工作者也都遵照着这一方向去进行实践，因而获得了人民文学近十年来的花朵，而胡风在一九四七年却还高唱他的滥调。
    马克思主义者对“五四”新文艺传统的认识，却与胡风的论断完全相反，“五四”新文艺的主潮，在反帝反封建上，尤其是在反对封建文学反对文言文上，是起过巨大的作用。“五四”新文艺主导的思想，虽然在无产阶级思想的领导和影响之下，但是，新文艺队伍的内部也还有严重的缺点，例如对待文学传统的态度就曾有过错误。毛主席曾指出：“但五四运动本身也是有缺点的。那时的许多领导人物，还没有马克思主义的批判精神，他们使用的方法，一般地还是资产阶级的方法，即形式主义的方法。他们反对旧八股、旧教条，主张科学和民主，是很对的。但是他们对于现状，对于历史，对于外国事物，没有历史唯物主义的批判精神，所谓坏的就是绝对的坏，一切皆坏；所谓好就是绝对的好，一切皆好。这种形式主义地看问题的方法，就影响了后来这个运动的发展。”〔二九〕这种形式主义看问题的缺点，在对待民族文学遗产的否定态度上表现得更加突出，而胡风却不仅把这种错误奉为至宝，而且把它发展成为系统理论，用“移入论”的“刀子”割断了“五四”革命文学与中国现实主义文学传统的联系，完全陷入到反马克思主义的泥淖中去。附带一句，轻视以至否定民族文学遗产，就是拉普派的理论特点之一。因此，说胡风是“掉进了拉普的理论”的泥沼里，是一点也不冤枉的。
    第三，与这个问题相联系的，“文化新军的最伟大和最英勇的旗手”鲁迅的创作，究竟是“民族”的还是“移入”的呢？对这一问题，有两种不同的回答。
    胡风认为，“那代表的战斗的作家，像小说里面的鲁迅，诗里面的郭沫若、康白情、湖畔诗人等，为了内容上的突进的革命精神底要求，形式上也采取了一种崭新的前无古人的姿态，形式和内容相应地掀起了一个狂风暴雨似的、伟大的革命。”〔三○〕“鲁迅底小说形式是从欧洲‘移植’过来的，对于中国的旧小说说，是全新的东西。鲁迅底杂文，散文、散文诗等，是多少改造了欧洲文学的同类形式而创造出来的，在中国是前无古人的东西。”〔三一〕
    但是，我们却和胡风看法相反。任何一个熟悉中国古典文学传统尤其是小说传统的人，读了鲁迅的小说，不仅会发现他曾受过欧洲文学的影响，更重要地是他继承并发扬了中国古典小说中的传统，在“表现的深切”和“格式底特别”上，更是发扬了中国古典小说民族形式的特色。撇开胡风所谓的“民族形式”（即语言）不谈，鲁迅小说继承了中国古典小说结构紧密、单纯、完整的特色，“画龙点睛”的写法，水墨画似的背景的烘托，刻划人物的白描手法，善于运用人物的行动和对话来表现人物的心理，不用静止的心理分析的方法，这完全是中国小说的传统特色，具有着中国老百姓所喜闻乐见的中国作风中国气派的特色。鲁迅先生自己是不曾否认过这一点的。他主张写人物要采取白描的手法，“要极省俭的画出一个人的特点，最好是画他的眼睛”〔三二〕，在创造典型时，可以“杂取种种人，合成一个，……这方法也和中国人的习惯相合，例如画家的画人物，也是静观默察，烂熟于心，然后凝神结想，一挥而就，向来不用一个单独的模特儿的。”〔三三〕鲁迅先生的小说，就是“逐渐脱离了外国作家的影响”，努力地把握民族的风格，因此，他的小说，才愈来愈博得广大人民的热爱。
    与此同时，胡风还认为，鲁迅是不主张接受中国古典文学遗产的。当然这个论点并不是明确提出来的，而是在坚决否认的情况下，曲解了鲁迅的原意。胡风说：“鲁迅终他的一生一直愤怒地反对了把新文学当作‘继承并发扬了民族文学传统’（？笔者）的民族复古主义的理论的。例如在‘青年必读书’，‘写在“坟”后面’等里面，就把‘用许多痛苦换来的真话’说得痛切之至，他甚至把读古书和做‘活人’看成了不能两立的事情，他恳切地希望青年们不要背上了‘古老的灵魂，摆脱不开’。在他去世之前，是还对林语堂、施蛰存、文直公、刘半农等民族复古思想做了毫不留情的斗争的。”〔三四〕但鲁迅提出这些主张时，是为了强调青年们要面对现实人生的斗争，不要被“国粹”“国故”大家们领到故书堆中去，不要走胡适之流的民族复古主义道路。同时，鲁迅先生所反对的是有害无益的“国粹”，而不是“文学遗产”。相反的，鲁迅先生却是真正提倡批判接受文化遗产的。在他谈到“新形式的探求”时就说过：“我们有艺术史，而且生在中国，即必须翻开中国的艺术史来。采取什么呢？我想，唐以前的真迹，我们无从目睹了，但还能知道大抵以故事为题材，这是可以取法的；在唐，可取佛画的灿烂，线条的空实和明快，宋的院画，萎靡柔媚之处当舍，周密不苟之处是可取的，米点山水，则毫无用处。后来的写意画（文人画）有无用处，我此刻不敢确说，恐怕也许还有可用之点的罢。这些采取，并非断片的古董的杂陈，必须溶化于新作品中，那是不必赘说的事，恰如喫用牛羊，弃去蹄毛，留其精粹，以滋养及发达新的生体，决不因此就会‘类乎’牛羊的。”并且还明确指出过这种继承关系的必然性；“以为艺术是艺术家的‘灵感’的爆发，像鼻子发痒的人，只要打出喷嚏来就浑身舒服，一了百了的时候已经过去了，现在想到，而且关心了大众。这是一个新思想（内容），由此而在探求新形式，首先提出的是旧形式的采取，这采取的主张，正是新形式的发端，也就是旧形式的蜕变，在我看来，是既没有将内容和形式机械地分开，更没有看得‘姊妹花’叫座，于是也来学一套的投机主义的罪案的。”（着重点是笔者加的）〔三五〕
      在这里，鲁迅先生不仅主张接受古典文化遗产，指出了接受什么，如何接受，接受的目的，而且明确地指出了胡风最厌恶的继承关系的必然性，难道这也算作民族复古主义者吗？胡风有什么理由摘取片言只句，故意混淆是非地把鲁迅先生也扮演成文化遗产的否定论者呢？
    由此可见，胡风对鲁迅先生的作品与理论都作了不正确的解释，其目的是用来给自己的错误理论作辩护。
    通过对这三个问题的简单分析，可以看出胡风在民族形式问题的“几个基本内容”，并非“还是没有错误的”，而是根本与马克思主义的观点相违背的。
      胡风在文联主席团和作协主席团的扩大联席会议的发言里，一再指斥文艺报所犯的错误是“形成了庸俗社会学的思想战线”，并给庸俗社会学下了一个界说：“什么是庸俗社会学？那基本特征是不从实际出发，不是凭着原则的引导去理解实际，而是用原则代替了实际，从固定的观念出发，甚至是从零乱的观念出发，用马克思主义的词句或者政策的词句去审判作品。”我们撇开他的“弦外之音”不谈，应该说这定义并没有真正说出来庸俗社会学的内容，而真正体现了庸俗社会学内容的倒是胡风自己的理论。
    胡风所谓的“新的文艺要求和先它存在的形式截然异质的突起的飞跃”，是把作为社会意识形态之一的文学和一般的上层建筑（政权、法律等），看做等同。一旦基础改变了，文学形式也要发生
  “截然异质的突起的飞跃”，割断了与传统的联系，成为传统的否定物。这是对于基础与上层建筑典型的庸俗的机械论的理解，这种机械论的理论大师弗理契就是这样理解文艺和解释欧洲文学发展史的，实际上这都是对于“文艺史底法则”的彻底否定。在阶级社会里，固然是统治阶级的文化是“统治文化”，但它并不是包括社会全部的思想意识。因为在“每个民族文化里面，都有了哪怕是不大发展的民主主义的和社会主义的文化成份，因为每个民族里面都有劳动的和被剥削的群众，他们的生活条件必然地要产生民主主义的和社会主义的思想体系。”（列宁）这种意识形态是以光荣的传统的形式生活着，新生的力量都要依靠着这种光荣的传统来求得发展，因而也就产生了遗产问题。这就是马克思主义从阶级分析法出发，对遗产问题所作出的正确结论。胡风对中国古典遗产的虚无主义态度，就正是缺乏这种阶级的分析方法，庸俗地理解上层建筑与基础的关系，因而，将中国古典文学的现实主义的传统，也归入“封建文艺”而加以否定。
  　胡风所谓的新文艺“要求从社会基础相类似的其他民族移入形式（以及方法）。”是把作为社会意识形态之一的文学，理解为不是民族的，不具有民族的特色，任何一个民族都可以随便“从社会基础相类似的其他民族移入形式（以及方法）。”这一方面仍然是由于对基础与上层建筑的庸俗理解，另一方面，是完全否定了民族的特性，将文学简单地归结为基础的直接反映，这是典型的庸俗社会学的理论。试问那被“移植”的形式是不是那被“移植”的民族的形式呢？胡风是不能够正确回答的。只有斯大林同志才对于这个问题作了正确的回答：“每一个民族，不论大小，都有它自己根本的特性，都有那种只能为它所有而为其他民族所无的特色。这些特性乃是每一个民族带到共同的世界文化宝库中使之充实及丰富起来的贡献。”〔三六〕
    胡风所谓的“民族形式”“文化遗产”“文学传统”等，都是被分割了的一个个孤立的概念，他使这些概念处在极端的绝对对立的情况下，时而明显地然而却是机械地理解内容决定形式的问题，时而孤立地主张“移入”形式而忽略了内容，使自己陷入不可避免的“混乱”里面，这正是庸俗社会学者的理所必然的悲剧“命运”。
    这就是胡风关于“民族形式”实质上是关于文学传统的理论的特色，同时也是庸俗社会学的特色。因而，形成“庸俗社会学思想战线”的，以庸俗社会学作武器否定中国古典文学现实主义传统的不是别人，正是胡风自己。而这种理论，正像许多同志过去已曾正确指出过的，它并不是胡风自己的创作，而是依照他的“移入论”“原则”从弗理契、卢卡契那里“移植”过来的。一向以马克思主义“自命”的胡风的理论，揭开他伪装的外衣，其真实面目不过如此。
    那么，胡风现在又提出他的这种理论，其目的何在呢？
    解放以后，文艺工作者遵照着毛主席批判接受文学遗产的指示，大力地开展着继承并发扬古典文艺遗产的工作，在小说、诗歌、散文、美术、戏剧、曲艺等各个领域里，提倡民族形式的批判的继承、改造与发扬，使之“百花齐放，推陈出新”，促进新文艺的发展，几年来已经取得了一定的成绩。这在客观上自然又触动了胡风所企图保卫的阵地，因此，他又不得不叫喊了。
    依照胡风的理论，谁要是提倡批判继承和发扬古典文艺的民族传统，不管你继承什么，怎样继承，继承的目的是什么，你就是“最顽固的民族复古主义者”。
    依照胡风的理论，谁要是提倡批判继承并发扬古典文艺的民族传统，不管你继承什么，怎样继承，继承的目的是什么，你就是排斥并取消国际主义的民族主义者，你就是文学的“单流论”者。
    依照胡风的理论，这些工作应立即停止，进行彻底的“改造”，将古典遗产囚到胡风的理论监牢中去。谁要是反对，不管你反对的是谁，反对的目的是什么，你就是反马克思主义，掉进了拉普派底“理论”的“泥沼”中去。
    由此可见，胡风现在提出了他的这种理论，在客观上就是直接反对党的文艺方针，民族形式问题只是他全部理论的一个部分。为了批判地继承并发扬中国古典文艺的优秀传统，使这一方针贯彻到底，就必须用马克思主义将胡风的反马克思主义理论，彻底干净地从文艺领域中扫荡出去。
