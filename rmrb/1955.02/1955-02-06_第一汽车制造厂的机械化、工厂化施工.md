Mechanized and Prefabricated Construction at the First Automobile Works
　　Fu Zhengming
The construction project of the First Automobile Works is very urgent, and the project is both heavy and complex. Dozens of projects and many types of work are being carried out simultaneously on a single site. The buildings are highly concentrated, and the working area is very narrow. Therefore, mechanized and prefabricated construction methods must be adopted to solve the difficulties in construction.

After more than two years of construction, mechanized and prefabricated construction at the First Automobile Works is now taking shape. All the machinery needed for construction engineering is available to some extent. In terms of earthwork engineering, there are excavators, bulldozers, scrapers, root removers, and ditch diggers. In terms of hoisting engineering, there are tower, tank-type, and automobile-type cranes and winches of different tonnages. In terms of concrete engineering, there are stone crushers, stone washing and screening machines, belt conveyors, and various mixers for concrete, mortar, and foam, as well as sprayers and vibrators for compacting concrete. In terms of leveling engineering, there are automatic graders, gasoline rollers, steam rollers, and sheep foot rollers. In terms of on-site transportation, there are flatbed trailers, trucks, and dump trucks of different tonnages, universal loaders and unloaders, and tractors. Responsible for the on-site repair of construction machinery are mobile repair vehicles, lubricators, chargers, and welding machines. In addition, there are pumps, air compressors, motors, oil tankers, and water tankers, which are auxiliary machines. In total, there are more than 40 types and more than 120 models. These construction machines are managed by the Mechanization Supply Station, which has professional teams for earthwork, hoisting and installation, concrete transportation, and general machinery. General transportation vehicles are managed by the Motor Vehicle Brigade. Mechanical repairs are handled by the Mechanical Repair Factory.

In terms of prefabrication, trial production began in August 1953 and mass production began. So far, five factories have been established, including a metal structure processing factory, a steel bar prefabrication factory, a wood processing factory, and a concrete mixing plant.

When mechanized and prefabricated construction began, the first difficulty encountered was having machines but no one to operate them. Although a portion was initially transferred from Anshan Iron and Steel, the quantity and technical level were far from meeting the needs. At that time, we adopted a short-term training method, and the Mechanization Supply Station organized a training class for a group of newly transferred activists and demobilized soldiers, with three teams under it: automobile, crane, and excavator. Based on the needs, a group of workers with certain technical knowledge (such as automobile assistants and repair shop apprentices) were selected for accelerated teaching. After more than a month, the first group of more than 100 students had improved from not understanding construction machinery or being unable to operate construction machinery independently to being able to operate independently or participate in construction production at a technical level. The rest of the people were given general training, that is, attending classes in the classroom and interning on the construction site. Once the technical level reached a certain level, they were transferred to work on the site. This learning-by-doing approach continued to enrich the strength of mechanical construction. By July of last year, more than 600 people had been trained, and most of them had achieved very good results. Among them were more than 20 female drivers, who, like male workers, learned the operating techniques of heavy machinery.

The production workers in each processing factory, in addition to a small number of carpenters, fitters, steel bar workers, blacksmiths, electricians, etc. transferred from various places, were also mostly new workers without any technical skills. However, after group classes and training in practical work, more than 80% of the people are now able to master simple techniques for operation. So far, we have a strong team for mechanized and prefabricated construction, which has initially solved the difficulty of technical strength not keeping up with the needs of construction.

Based on the experience in practical work over the past year, the advantages of mechanized and prefabricated construction are indeed numerous, mainly manifested in the following aspects:

1. Since the components of buildings can be manufactured in advance according to the design, simplifying the process and shortening the interval between each process, the progress of the project is greatly accelerated. For example, in concrete engineering, field pouring and natural drying requires seven days before the formwork can be removed, and after the formwork is removed, it must be dried for 15 to 20 days; while in factory prefabrication, using steam drying, the formwork can be removed in only 18 hours. The auxiliary workshop has 41,500 cubic meters of backfill work. Due to the use of scrapers, bulldozers, rollers, dump trucks, tractors, and sheep foot rollers for filling and compaction, it was completed in only 20 working days; if manual labor were used, it would take approximately 42,000 working days, and if 500 people worked every day, it would take 84 days.

2. Since factory prefabrication is a regular and professional concentrated production, it is easy to uniformly grasp specifications and quality standards, and the working conditions of factory production are better than those on site, and workers can easily become proficient in operation, which provides a greater guarantee for improving quality. For example, in concrete compaction, the use of electric vibration tables and mechanical compaction makes the concrete dense and uniform, preventing defects such as pitting and honeycombing. In terms of model boards, the use of copper molds prevents deformation of prefabricated products.

3. Reduced construction costs. First, it saves a large number of laborers. For example, the efficiency of a 0.5 cubic meter excavator is approximately equal to 130 ordinary workers. Saving labor also saves the construction and management costs of temporary construction sheds. Second, due to centralized production and centralized material distribution, materials of good, bad, large, and small sizes can be comprehensively allocated and used rationally, thus reducing the consumption rate of raw materials (this is most evident in steel bar prefabrication factories and wood factories). In addition, in concrete prefabrication component operations, the turnover of formwork can be accelerated; the storage of raw materials and finished products is centralized, which is convenient for laying traffic lines; the shutdown and idle work caused by climate changes can be reduced; and due to mechanized and prefabricated production, the processing, ordering, leasing, and contract systems can be widely adopted, which makes it easy to control costs and conduct economic accounting. All of these greatly reduce construction costs.

4. It is not necessary to pile up a large amount of materials on site, saving on-site land. We have arranged the auxiliary enterprises and material storage locations outside the site area, which provides very favorable conditions for large-scale construction on narrow sites, and simplifies on-site management and avoids chaos.

5. The widespread adoption of new technologies and equipment reduces the heavy physical labor of workers, thereby ensuring safety in construction. For example, purlins, roof panels, bricks, and mortar are all transported vertically by mechanical means, and columns, beams, roof trusses, etc. are all hoisted by cranes, and earthwork is mostly carried out by mechanical construction.

However, since mechanized and prefabricated construction is still a new attempt for us, we lack knowledge and experience in this area, and we lack specific organizational measures. Therefore, there are still many shortcomings in the management and use of machinery, which are manifested in:

1. Low utilization rate of machinery and equipment, and very serious idling. According to the statistics of the Mechanization Supply Station from May to August last year, the good vehicle rate of several major machines was 82.5%, but only 44.7% were actually in production. Some machines, such as automatic graders, trenching machines, and universal loaders, are rarely used throughout the year. The main reason for these situations is the uneven use of machinery. For example, during foundation engineering or rainy season construction, the amount of pumps used is very large, and the amount used at other times is very small; earthwork machinery is used in large quantities during foundation engineering, while hoisting machinery is used in small quantities; conversely, when the foundation is completed and installation begins, hoisting machinery is used in large quantities, while earthwork machinery is used less. Some auxiliary machines, such as air compressors, rollers, and sheep foot rollers, are sometimes very much needed but not commonly used. Secondly, due to insufficient technical strength and low technical level, and limited by site conditions, some machines cannot exert their maximum efficiency. In addition, some construction units have the idea of "rather more than less, wide use than narrow use," preparing more and using less, which also causes many machines to be backlogged. For example, the equipment backlogged in the wood factory accounts for 45% of the factory's total machinery.

2. Poor planning and management. Due to lack of experience, coupled with the urgency of time, technical complexity, and large site changes, it is often the case that while idling, there is a rush to seize work, which causes great difficulties in the coordination of auxiliary enterprises. For example, in terms of mechanized construction, taking the usage of several major machines in August last year as an example, the percentage of bulldozers not used within the plan was 9%, while the percentage of those added outside the plan was 17%; the percentage of rollers not used within the plan was 39%, while the percentage of those added outside the plan was 44%; the percentage of cranes not used within the plan was 30%, while the percentage of those added outside the plan was 25%. This not only disrupted the production plan, but also affected a series of tasks such as machinery repair, spare parts, and fuel storage, and financial management. In terms of factory prefabrication, the actual usage of some materials exceeded the original plan many times, while some materials were heavily backlogged.

3. High mechanical damage rate and many accidents. According to the percentage of repair time to production time for several machines in the second quarter of last year, it was 25.9% for excavators, 40.5% for bulldozers, and 31.4% for cranes, which shows the seriousness of mechanical damage. In addition, from April to August last year alone, there were 256 accidents. There are many reasons for the high damage rate and many accidents, such as workers' lack of technical proficiency, some workers violating operating procedures, and poor maintenance, which are all important reasons.

4. Low mechanical production efficiency and high cost. The reason is first that due to lack of technical proficiency, many mechanical constructions can only reach about 70% of the quota. Secondly, the cooperation between the work area and the machinery supply station is not good enough. The work area often only asks for it when it is needed. After the machinery arrives at the construction site, the work area directs the use, and the machinery supply station only charges according to the time, and does not care whether the use is reasonable and the production efficiency is high or low. The work area often neglects to create favorable conditions for the use of machinery. Sometimes the machinery arrives at the construction site and cannot be constructed immediately, and sometimes it is placed in the work area without being used. In addition, the quota itself is not perfect. In the past, there were only general quotas, and there was no conversion method based on various construction conditions. For example, in earthwork engineering, conversion methods should be made based on different conditions such as soil quality, terrain, moisture content, soil extraction depth, unloading location, and climate. Due to unreasonable quotas, the using unit and the mechanical management unit often argue, which also disrupts the mechanical balance plan.

The above many problems make us more deeply realize the complexity of mechanized and prefabricated construction, and make us further realize that, whether in the production process and production management, or in the organization and coordination of labor, we must adapt and reform accordingly, in order to enable mechanized and prefabricated construction to play a greater role.

    第一汽车制造厂的机械化、工厂化施工
    傅正明
    第一汽车制造厂的建厂工程，时间很紧迫，工程既繁重又复杂，一个现场有几十项工程和很多工种同时施工，建筑物很集中，作业面积又很窄，因此，必须采取机械化、工厂化的施工方法，才能解决施工中的困难。
    经过两年多来的建设，现在第一汽车制造厂机械化、工厂化施工已初具规模。凡是建筑工程中所需要的机械都或多或少的具备了。如土方工程方面，有掘土机、推土机、铲运机、除根机、挖滑机。起重工程方面，有塔式、坦克型、汽车型等不同吨位的起重机、卷扬机。混凝土工程方面，有轧石机、石子洗筛机、皮带运输机、混凝土、灰浆、泡沫各式搅拌机、喷浆器及捣固混凝土用的震动器。平整工程方面，有自动平地机、汽油压路机、蒸汽压路机、羊足压路机。工地运输方面，有不同吨位的平板拖车、汽车和自卸汽车，万能装卸机、拖拉机等。负责现场施工机械修理工作的有流动修理车、润滑机、充电机、发电机、电焊机。此外还有抽水机、空气压缩机、电动机、油箱车、水箱车等属于辅助性的机械。总计有四十多种，一百二十多类型。这些施工机械统由机械化供应站管理，下设土方、起重安装、混凝土运输、一般机具等各专业队。一般运输汽车由汽车大队管理。机械修理有机械修理厂。
    工厂化方面，自一九五三年八月就开始试制产品并大量生产。到目前为止，已建立了金属结构加工厂、钢筋预制工厂、木材加工厂及混凝土搅拌厂等五个厂。
    当机械化、工厂化施工开始后，首先碰到的困难是有了机械，没有人来操作。虽然最初由鞍钢等地抽调来一部分，但数量与技术水平都远远赶不上需要。当时我们就采取短期训练的办法，把新调来的一批积极分子和部队转业来的一部分战士，由机械化供应站组织了一个训练班，下设汽车、吊车、掘土机三个队，并根据需要，先挑选一批有一定技术常识的工人（如汽车助手、修理厂徒工等）施以速成教学。一个多月以后，第一批学员一百多人已从不懂施工机械或不能单独操作施工机械提高到能单独操作或能参加施工生产的技术水平了。其余的人是进行一般的训练，即一面在课堂上课，一面在工地实习，技术水平达到一定程度即调现场工作。这样边学边作，继续充实了机械施工的力量。到去年七月间，已培养训练了六百多人，而且大部分成绩都很好。其中还有二十多个女驾驶员，她们与男工一样学会了重型机械的操作技术。
    各加工厂的生产工人，除了由各处调来的少数木工、钳工、钢筋工、锻工、电工等外，绝大部分也都是完全没有技术的新工人。但是，经过分组上课讲解和在实际工作中的锻炼，现在百分之八十以上的人都能掌握简单技术进行操作了。到目前为止，我们已有一支机械化、工厂化施工的强大队伍，初步解决了技术力量赶不上施工需要的困难。
    根据一年多来在实际工作中的体会，机械化、工厂化施工的优越性的确是很多的，主要表现在以下几方面：
    一、由于建筑物各部构件可以按照设计预先制造，简化了工序并缩短了各工序之间的间歇时间，所以大大加速了工程进度。如混凝土工程，在现场浇灌自然干燥，需要七天以后才能拆模，拆模以后，还得干燥十五天到二十天；而在工厂预制，采用蒸汽干燥，只要十八小时就可以拆模了。辅助车间有四万一千五百立方公尺的回填土工程，由于采用了铲运机、推土机、压路机、自卸车、拖拉机、羊足压路机等机械进行填土和压实，只用了二十个工作日就完工了；如果用人工，大约需要四万两千个工作日，若每天五百人工作，就需要八十四天。
    二、由于工厂化是经常的专业的进行集中生产，容易统一掌握规格和质量标准，加以工厂生产的工作条件比现场好，工人操作容易熟练，对提高质量就更有保证。如在混凝土捣固方面，因为利用了电动震动台和机械捣固，使得混凝土密实均匀，防止了麻面、蜂窝等毛病。在模型板方面，因为采用了铜模，防止了预制品的变形。
    三、降低了建筑成本。首先是节省了大批劳动力，如一部○点五立方公尺掘土机的效率大约等于一百三十个普通工。由于节省了劳动力，也就节省了临时工房的建造和管理费用。其次是由于集中生产、集中配料，使好、坏、大、小不等的材料可以通盘调配合理使用，因而降低了原材料的消耗率
  （这在钢筋预制工厂和木工厂最显著）。另外，如在混凝土预制构件作业中可以加速模板周转；原材料与成品堆放集中，便于铺设交通线路；因气候变化影响的停工和窝工可以减少；以及由于机械化、工厂化生产，可以广泛采用加工、订货、租赁和合同制度，容易控制成本，进行经济核算等等，这些，都大大降低了建筑成本。
    四、不必在现场堆置大量材料，节省了现场用地。我们把附属企业和材料堆放位置都布置在现场区域以外，这样就给在狭窄的现场进行大规模施工提供了十分有利的条件，并使现场管理简化，避免混乱。
    五、由于广泛地采用了新的技术设备，减轻了工人们繁重的体力劳动，从而保障了施工中的安全。如檩条、屋面板、砖、灰浆等都采用机械垂直运输，柱、梁、屋架等都用起重机装吊，土方大都采用机械施工。
    但是，由于机械化、工厂化施工对于我们来说还是一种新的尝试，缺乏这方面的知识和经验，缺乏具体的组织措施，因此对机械的管理和使用上，还存在着不少的缺点，这表现在：
    一、机械设备利用率低，窝工情形很严重。根据机械化供应站去年五月至八月的统计，几种主要机械的完好车率为百分之八十二点五，但实际进行生产的仅占百分之四十四点七。有些机械如自动平地机、挖沟机、万能装卸机等常年都很少使用。产生这些情况的主要原因是由于机械使用不均衡，如做基础工程或雨季施工时，抽水机使用量很大，其他时间使用量就很小；做基础工程时土方机械使用量大，而起重机械使用量就小；相反的，基础做好了，开始安装时，起重机械使用量大而土方机械使用量又少了。还有些附属机械如空气压缩机、压路机、羊足压路机等，有时很需要但又不常用。其次是由于技术力量不足和技术水平不高以及受场地条件所限，致使有些机械还不能发挥最大的效能。另外，有些施工单位存在着“宁多勿少，宽打窄用”思想，准备的多，使用的少，也使得很多机械被积压。如木工厂积压的设备竟占该厂全部机械的百分之四十五。
    二、计划管理欠周密。由于缺乏经验，加上时间紧迫，技术复杂，现场变化大，所以常常是一面窝工，一面又突击抢工，使附属企业在配合上发生很大困难。如在机械化施工方面，以去年八月份的几种主要机械的使用情况为例，推土机计划内不用的占百分之九，而计划外增加的有百分之十七；压路机计划内不用的占百分之三十九，计划外增加的有百分之四十四；吊车计划内不用的占百分之三十，计划外增加的有百分之二十五。这样不但打乱了生产计划，同时也影响到机械检修、以及配件，和油料的储备，财务的管理等一系列工作。在工厂化方面，有的材料的实际使用量超过原计划很多倍，有些材料又大量积压。
    三、机械损坏率大，事故多。根据去年第二季度几种机械修理时间所占生产时间的百分比来看，挖土机为百分之二十五·九，推土机百分之四十·五，起重机百分之三十一·四，这说明机械损坏的严重情况。另外仅从去年四月至八月的统计，就发生了事故二百五十六次。产生损坏率大、事故多的原因很多，如工人技术不熟练，有些工人违反操作规程，以及保管不善等，都是重要原因。
    四、机械生产效能低，成本高。其原因首先是由于技术不熟练，很多机械施工只能达到定额的百分之七十左右。其次是工区与机械供应站之间的配合不够好，工区往往是现用现要，机械到达工地后，由工区指挥使用，机械化供应站只是按时间收费，也不管使用是否合理和生产效率高低，而工区又往往忽视为使用机械创造有利条件，有时机械到达工地后，不能即刻施工，甚至有时放在工区里没有使用。另外就是定额本身不完善，过去只有一般定额，没有根据各种不同施工情况制定换算方法。如土方工程，应根据土质、地形、含水量、取土深度、卸土地点、气候等不同情况，作出换算办法。由于定额不合理，使用单位与机械管理单位经常扯皮，同时也打乱了机械平衡计划。
    上述这许多问题，使我们更深刻的体会到机械化、工厂化施工的复杂性，使我们进一步地认识到，不论在生产过程和生产管理方面，以及劳动力的组织与配合方面，都必须相适应地进行改革，才能使机械化、工厂化施工发挥出更大的作用。
