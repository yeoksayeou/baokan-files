Xinhua News Agency, February 24th: Damascus dispatch, according to TASS dispatch of February 23rd: Prime Minister Asali of Syria announced the program of his government in the Syrian parliament on the 22nd.

The program pointed out that the new government's policy is intended to maintain Syria's national independence and republican regime, and to disassociate itself from Arab countries that rely on foreign countries. In its statement, the Syrian government also pointed out that it refuses to participate in the proposed Turkish-Iraqi treaty or any other military alliance other than the Arab League Collective Security Pact.

While announcing its support for the recommendations on the policies of Arab countries made by the Arab Foreign Ministers Conference in Cairo last December, the statement put forward a reservation. The statement pointed out that it adopts a cautious attitude towards the conference's recommendation on cooperation with Western countries "under certain conditions."

After Asali made the statement, the parliament began to debate the government program.

Prior to this, according to Cairo Radio, Asali said on the eve of the parliamentary debate that delegations composed of workers, technicians and students had visited him, requesting that he publicly announce in the government report to parliament that the Syrian government opposes the Turkish-Iraqi treaty and refuses to participate in any other military bloc.

    叙利亚新总理阿萨利宣布施政纲领
    声明要保持叙利亚的民族独立和共和政权
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社二十三日讯：大马士革消息，阿萨利总理二十二日在叙利亚议会宣布了他的政府的纲领。
    这个纲领指出，新政府的政策是打算保持叙利亚的民族独立和共和政权，并和依靠外国的阿拉伯国家脱离关系。叙利亚政府在它的声明中还指出，它拒绝参加拟议中的土耳其—伊拉克条约或阿拉伯国家集体安全公约以外的其他军事联盟。
    声明在宣布支持阿拉伯国家外长会议去年十二月在开罗所作的关于阿伯拉国家政策的建议时，提出了一项保留。声明指出，它对会议关于“在一定的条件”下和西方国家进行合作的建议，采取谨慎的态度。
    在阿萨利发表声明以后，议会就开始进行关于政府纲领的辩论。
    在这以前，据开罗电台广播，阿萨利曾在议会辩论的前夕说，由工人，技术工人和学生组成的代表团访问过他，要求他在议会作政府报告时公开宣布，叙利亚政府反对土耳其—伊拉克条约，并拒绝参加任何其他军事集团。
