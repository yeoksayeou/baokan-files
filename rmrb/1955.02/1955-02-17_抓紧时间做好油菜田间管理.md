	Seize the Time to Do a Good Job of Rapeseed Field Management
	Oil Crops Division, General Bureau of Grain Production, Ministry of Agriculture
	Last winter, the Yangtze River basin was hit by a cold wave. Rapeseed in the main producing areas such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces suffered frost damage to varying degrees. In addition, the rapeseed sowing period was delayed last year, cultivation was rough, basal fertilizer was insufficient, and new rapeseed farmers lacked cultivation experience, resulting in poor rapeseed growth in these areas. Some farmers have a habit of plowing rapeseed as green manure and do not pay attention to field management of rapeseed. These situations indicate that if leadership is relaxed, rapeseed production this year will be severely affected. Currently, the weather is warming up, which is an important season for rapeseed growth. All localities should seize the time, strengthen leadership, rely on mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and lead the broad masses of farmers to do a good job in rapeseed field management.
	Rapeseed is a crop with strong cold resistance. Sometimes, although the plant's exterior has withered, its growing point is still healthy. If growing conditions improve, it can continue to grow. Therefore, the losses caused by frost damage are not entirely unrecoverable. At present, all localities should mobilize farmers to conduct a focused inspection of rapeseed growth; rapeseed that has suffered frost damage should be treated differently depending on the situation. For rapeseed fields that are generally not severely frozen or have only sporadic deaths, fertilizer should be actively applied after the snow melts, and work such as strengthening cultivation and soil consolidation should be carried out to promote rapeseed growth. In areas where there is a habit of plowing rapeseed, it is even more necessary to persuade farmers to strengthen field management and prevent arbitrary plowing of rapeseed fields on the pretext of frost damage.
	In areas where there was heavy snowfall last year or more rain in the spring, it is necessary to pay special attention to ditch and furrow management and to establish a good drainage system to avoid waterlogging and disease. After the rapeseed starts to bolt, its cold resistance decreases. At this time, it is necessary to prepare smoke materials in an organized and leadership-led manner as early as possible, stack them at the edges of the fields, and prevent possible late frosts. In areas where insect pests occur, all forces must be used to prevent and control them as early as possible to avoid spreading and causing disasters.
	Experience has shown that applying top dressing fertilizer to rapeseed during the initial flowering period has a significant yield-increasing effect. This is because rapeseed has a long flowering period and requires more fertilizer. Applying top dressing fertilizer can promote more flowers and pods, and the seeds will be full and substantial, increasing yield. In addition, topping, assisting pollination, and careful harvesting are all important measures to increase rapeseed production and reduce losses, and can be universally carried out in various regions.

    抓紧时间做好油菜田间管理
    农业部粮食生产总局油料处
    去冬长江流域受到寒流袭击，主要油菜产区如江苏、浙江、湖北、湖南、江西等省的油菜，都遭受到了不同程度的冻害。再加去年油菜播种时期延迟，耕作粗放，基肥不足，新种油菜的农民又缺乏栽培经验，以致这些地区油菜生长较差。有些农民有翻耕油菜作绿肥的习惯，更不重视油菜的田间管理。这些情况说明，如果放松领导，今年油菜的产量将会受到严重的影响。目前天气转暖，正是油菜生长的重要季节，各地应当抓紧时间，加强领导，依靠互助合作组织，带动广大农民，做好油菜田间管理工作。
    油菜是抗寒力较强的作物，有时虽然植株外表已经枯萎，而它的生长点仍然健在，假如生长条件好转，还可继续生长。因此，由于冻害所造成的损失，并不是完全不可以补救的。目前各地应当发动农民对油菜生长情况，有重点地进行一次检查；对遭受冻害的油菜，要分别不同情况加以处理。一般受冻不重，或只有零星死亡的油菜田，在积雪融解后，应积极追施肥料，加强中耕培土等工作，以促进油菜生长。有翻耕油菜习惯的地区，更要说服农民加强田间管理，防止以冻害为借口，随意翻耕油菜田。
    去年积雪较厚或春季多雨的地区，需要特别重视沟畦整理，作好排水系统，以免积水成涝，引起病害。油菜起苔后，抗寒力减低，这时就需要有组织有领导地及早准备熏烟材料，堆放田边地头，预防可能发生的晚霜。发生虫害的地区，要利用一切力量，及早防治，以免蔓延成灾。
    经验证明，油菜在初花期施追肥，有显著的增产效果。这是因为油菜开花期较长，需肥较多，施追肥后能促使花多荚多，籽粒饱满充实，增加产量。此外，摘苔、辅助授粉、细收细打等工作，都是增加油菜产量，减少损失的重要措施，各地可以普遍进行。
