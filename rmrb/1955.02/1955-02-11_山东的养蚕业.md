    Shandong's Sericulture Industry
    Sun Fei

    Shandong is one of the earliest regions in China to engage in sericulture. The people of Shandong had already begun raising silkworms before the Shang and Zhou dynasties. Sericulture was already quite common as far back as the Warring States period. According to historical records from the last century, the period from 1910 to 1920 was the most prosperous period for sericulture in Shandong Province. At that time, 107 out of the province's 108 counties cultivated mulberry trees and raised silkworms, producing more than 2 million jin of tussah silk and 40 million jin of mulberry silkworm cocoons annually.

    The people of Shandong have an extreme love for silk production. In Linqu County, there is a saying that "half of Linqu County is mulberry, and Linqu silk is never-ending." In thousands of years of labor, the people of Shandong have accumulated valuable experience in sericulture and have also cultivated excellent varieties of mulberry trees and mulberry and tussah silkworm cocoons. "Lu mulberry" is one of the best mulberry tree varieties in the world, and the pruning techniques of "Lu mulberry" are also a very good planting experience created by the local working people. Furthermore, varieties such as "Kelingzhuang" and "Weihai Zhuang" for tussah silkworm cocoons, and "Lu Huang" for mulberry silkworms, are all extremely valuable legacies.

    During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, the silk industry was manipulated by the feudal ruling class and comprador capitalists, and silk production rose and fell with the economic changes of imperialist countries. After 1931, due to the impact of the economic crisis in various capitalist countries around the world, silk production in Shandong gradually declined. During the Anti-Japanese War, due to the brutal destruction by the enemy and puppets, more than 75 percent of the mulberry trees were cut down, and there was no market for cocoons and silk, so most silkworm farmers were forced to stop raising silkworms. By the time of the province's liberation in 1949, the entire province only produced 600 dan of tussah silk and 2.1 million jin of mulberry cocoons, and some excellent silkworm varieties were also lost.

    In the few years since liberation, Shandong's sericulture has achieved certain results in restoring production. In 1954, the total output of tussah cocoons increased sixfold compared to 1949. According to statistics from the past four years, the province has trained approximately 20,000 silkworm farmers and cultivated approximately 520 agricultural production cooperative and mutual aid group mulberry and tussah silkworm technicians; the number of improved mulberry silkworm varieties promoted has increased by 6.5 times compared to the time of liberation. Silkworm farmers generally use scientific sericulture techniques, basically eliminating the superstitious idea of ​​"speaking of wealth and fate," so the unit cocoon yield has generally increased. In 1950, the province's average cocoon yield per improved variety was 27 jin, 33 jin in 1951, 34 jin in 1952, 42.7 jin in 1953, and even increased to 47.8 jin in 1954, an increase of 77 percent in four years. With the development of mutual aid and cooperation, in 1954, the number of improved mulberry silkworm varieties hatched collectively reached 80.5 percent, and collective rearing of young and mature silkworms accounted for 7 percent of the total silkworm households. According to a survey in Linqu County in 1954, the county raised 40,771 improved varieties of silkworms in the spring, with an average yield of 50 jin and 2 taels of cocoons per variety. Among them, the 1,056 varieties raised by cooperatives yielded an average of 60 jin and 14 taels of cocoons per variety, exceeding the production of local individual farmers by more than 30 percent. Qingquan Agricultural Production Cooperative raised 41 varieties of silkworms, with an average yield of 73 jin and 14 taels per variety, setting a banner for high yields in large communal rearing rooms. The quality of silkworm cocoons has also improved year by year. In recent years, the silk yield of improved cocoons has generally increased by about 20 percent. In terms of tussah silkworm production, silkworm farmers have gained a lot of experience in the struggle against natural disasters. In 1954, the Red Star Agricultural Production Cooperative of Dagu Jiagou in Wulian County used scientific and technological means to launch a large-scale pest control and seedling protection campaign, using "666" to control tussah pests, with a cost of only 1,300 yuan per mu, setting an example of overcoming insect pests and ensuring a bumper harvest, changing the idea that "insect pests cannot be controlled" that had existed among the masses for many years, thereby increasing the masses' confidence in pest control and laying a favorable foundation for ensuring unit yield in the future.

    The silk industry has also played a significant role in improving people's lives and supporting agricultural production. According to a survey in Linqu County, the average income from silkworm cocoons accounts for 29.8 percent of the agricultural income of general silkworm households; and the cocoon harvest is in the spring and summer seasons, when there is a shortage of food in the farmland, which gives farmers a great deal of help in production and life. In 1954, five agricultural production cooperatives in the sixth district of Linqu County raised 100 varieties of silkworms, and after selling the cocoons, they used the cocoon money to buy more than 7,200 jin of chemical fertilizer and 4,260 jin of soybean cake. The remaining mulberry branches and silkworm manure from sericulture can be used to feed 50 fat pigs weighing more than 100 jin. Another example is Dagu Jiagou Village in Wulian County. In 1954, all 193 people in the village raised silkworms, harvesting 1.81 million tussah cocoons, with a total income of more than 65 million yuan, equivalent to the value of 90,000 jin of grain, which is more than the grain produced by the entire village in two years.

    Although Shandong's silk production has made great progress in the past few years, it is still far from meeting the needs of the country and the people. Because the silk business departments have neglected to guide farmers in planting mulberry trees and lack cultivation and management of the original mulberry trees, although the unit yield of silkworm cocoons has increased, the number of mulberry leaves has not increased, and the number of silkworm varieties raised in some old silkworm areas has decreased rather than increased. At present, some silkworm farmers have concerns, such as thinking: "We are about to join the commune, and planting mulberry trees now will be a waste in the future." Some cooperatives have not achieved a balance between agriculture and sericulture and reasonable evaluation of production when dealing with the shares of mulberry fields, resulting in the phenomenon of digging up mulberry trees. In terms of tussah silkworm production, it has suffered from serious diseases and insect pests for many years. These factors are affecting the rapid development of sericulture production.

    In order to implement the state's policy of vigorously developing silk production and ensure that it is restored to the pre-war peak level by 1962, Shandong Province has decided to take various effective measures to develop sericulture.

    山东的养蚕业
    孙沸
    山东是我国养蚕最早的地区之一。早在商、周之前，山东人民就已开始养蚕。远在战国时代养蚕就已相当普遍了。据近百年历史资料记载，一九一○年到一九二○年是山东省养蚕事业最盛时期，当时全省一百零八县中有一百零七县栽桑养蚕，年产柞丝二百多万斤、桑蚕茧四千多万斤。
    山东人民对蚕丝生产是极其热爱的。在临朐县就流传着“临朐县桑一半，临朐丝买不断”的谚语。山东人民在数千年的劳动中积累了宝贵的养蚕经验，也培育了优良的桑树和桑、柞茧品种。“鲁桑”是世界上最优良的桑树品系之一，“鲁桑”的修剪技术也是当地劳动人民创造的一种很好的植桑经验；再如柞茧种的“克领庄”“威海庄”，桑蚕种的“鲁黄”，都是极宝贵的遗产。
    在国民党反动统治时期，蚕丝业被封建统治阶级和买办资本家所操纵，蚕丝生产是随帝国主义国家经济变化而消长的。一九三一年以后，由于世界各资本主义国家经济危机的影响，山东蚕丝产量逐渐下降。抗日战争期间，经敌伪残酷破坏，桑树被砍伐达百分之七十五以上，茧丝无销路，大部分蚕民被迫停止养蚕。到一九四九年全省解放时，全省仅产柞茧丝六百担，桑茧二百一十万斤，一些优良蚕品种也损失无存。
    解放后几年来，山东蚕业在恢复生产方面获得了一定的成绩。一九五四年柞蚕总产茧量比一九四九年增加了六倍。根据四年来的统计，全省共训练蚕农约达二万人，培养农业生产合作社、互助组桑、柞蚕技术员约五百二十余人；桑蚕良种推广数量比解放时增加了六点五倍，蚕农养蚕一般地都能采用科学的养蚕技术，基本上消除了“讲财命”的迷信思想，因而单位产茧量普遍提高。一九五○年全省平均每张改良种产茧二十七斤，一九五一年三十三斤，一九五二年三十四斤，一九五三年四十二点七斤，一九五四年更增加到四十七点八斤，四年来提高了百分之七十七。随着互助合作的发展，一九五四年桑蚕改良种集体催青张数已达百分之八十点五，稚蚕和壮蚕集体饲育的占总蚕户的百分之七。据一九五四年临朐县调查，全县春期饲养改良种四万零七百七十一张，平均每张收茧五十斤二两，其中合作社饲养的一千零五十六张，平均每张采茧六十斤十四两，超出当地个体农民的生产量百分之三十以上。清泉农业生产合作社饲养蚕种四十一张，每张平均产量达七十三斤十四两，树立了大共育室高额产量的旗帜。蚕茧质量也逐年提高，数年来改良茧的出丝量一般提高了百分之二十左右。在柞蚕生产方面，蚕农在同自然灾害作斗争当中，取得了不少经验。一九五四年五莲县大沽家沟红星农业生产合作社运用科学技术发动了大规模的除虫保苗运动，用“六六六”防治柞岚害虫，每市亩仅合成本一千三百元，树立了战胜虫害保证丰收的范例，转变了多年来群众中存在的“虫害没法治”的想法，因而提高了群众防治虫害的信心，给今后保证单位产量打下了有利的基础。
    蚕丝业对于改善人民生活和支持农业生产，也起了很大作用。据临朐县调查，一般蚕户的蚕茧收入平均占农业收入的百分之二十九点八；并且茧收正在春夏之交、农田青黄不接的时候，这就更给了农民生产和生活上很大的帮助。临朐县六区五个农业生产合作社，一九五四年养了一百张蚕种，卖茧后即用茧款买了化学肥料七千二百多斤，买豆饼四千二百六十斤，养蚕剩下的残桑蚕沙能喂肥五十口一百多斤重的肥猪。又如五莲县大沽家沟村一九五四年全村一百九十三人放蚕，收柞茧一百八十一万粒，共约收入六千五百余万元，相当于九万斤谷子的价值，比全村两年生产的谷子还多。
    几年来山东的蚕丝生产虽有很大的发展，但还远远跟不上国家和人民的需要。由于蚕丝业务部门忽视了领导农民对桑树的栽植，对原有桑株又缺乏培育管理，虽然蚕茧单位产量有所提高，但桑叶没有增加，个别老蚕区养种张数有减无加。目前有的蚕农有顾虑，如认为：“快要入社了，现在栽上桑将来就白搭了。”有的合作社在对桑田入股的处理上没有做到农桑兼顾和合理评产，因而产生刨桑的现象。柞蚕生产方面，连年遭到严重的病虫害。这些都影响着蚕业生产的迅速发展。
    为了贯彻国家大力发展蚕丝生产的方针，保证到一九六二年恢复到战前的最高水平，山东省已决定采取各种有效措施，发展养蚕业。
