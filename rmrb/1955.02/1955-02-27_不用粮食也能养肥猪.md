To the Editor:

	In rural areas, one often hears the saying: you can't fatten pigs without feeding them grain. In reality, this isn't the case. Fan Shenghe, the director of the Dayi Agricultural Production Cooperative in Baifang Township, Changning County, in our district, fattened pigs last year without using grain. The story is as follows: Last March, Fan Shenghe (then still a mutual aid team leader) heard Comrade Li Yaoxi, who was working on the general election in the township, introduce a method from the newspaper of feeding pigs with coarse bran, wild grass, and raw materials. Later, when he went to the county to attend the People's Congress meeting, he also visited the county farm and saw the specific facts of feeding pigs with rice bran and raw materials. He felt that this method was very good, as it saved grain, labor, and firewood, and reduced costs, making it very worthwhile. After returning from the county, he introduced the new pig-raising methods and experiences he had seen to the team members.

	This pig-raising method is as follows: First, stir-fry the rice husks until yellow (but not burnt black), then crush them with a mortar (or grind them); then pile the finely chopped sweet potato vines into containers such as jars and boxes, mash the yeast cakes used for making wine, and sprinkle them on the chopped sweet potato vines (about half a jin per hundred jin of sweet potato vines) to ferment and soften the sweet potato vines. Both the stir-fried coarse bran and the fermented sweet potato vines have a fragrant smell, which can attract pigs to eat and help with digestion. When feeding the pigs, mix the fermented sweet potato vines and the stir-fried and ground rice husks evenly, and then use a small amount of rice soup or boiling water to thin the mixture. It can then be fed to the pigs. However, do not add too much water, roughly the same as cattle feed. If there are vegetable cakes, cotton cakes, or soybean cakes, it would be even better to add some, generally two or three liang per day for pigs under sixty jin, and three or four liang per day for pigs over sixty jin. This way the pigs will grow glossy and red. If there are no cakes, they can also be omitted. If there are no sweet potato vines, other green grass, vegetable leaves, and crushed rice husks that can be used to raise pigs can also be mixed together and used as raw feed, but the green grass and vegetable leaves do not need to be fermented with yeast cakes. Just chop them up and mix them evenly, then add rice soup or boiling water and feed them to the pigs.

	After hearing this method, everyone didn't believe it, thinking he was talking nonsense, because everyone had never heard of using green grass, rice husks, and raw materials to fatten pigs. Fan Shenghe thought to himself: I must use facts to make them believe. So he bought a small pig weighing forty-eight jin and personally used the new method to feed it. For the first two days, the pig really didn't like to eat it, so he added a little rice soup. As a result, the pig ate it, but didn't finish it. He thought that it must be that too much water was added, and the bran was stir-fried too much and had a bitter taste. So he stir-fried the bran again, added less rice soup, and mixed it into a dry feed like feeding cattle. The pig ate it and seemed to want more. He was very happy. Day after day, this little pig grew as if it were being blown up, growing fat and glossy. After two months and two days, it had grown to one hundred and four jin, an average growth of more than thirteen liang per day. This pig was raised and fattened without eating a single grain of rice.

	Fan Shenghe's success in raising pigs with the new method made all the team members follow his method and raise pigs. Originally, only nine of the eighteen households in the team raised thirteen pigs. Later, every household in the team raised pigs, a total of thirty-eight pigs; Fan Shenghe himself raised four. The team members said, "In the past, we were too conservative and didn't believe in advanced experience. We always thought that pigs couldn't be fattened without feeding them rice. Now we know that this idea was wrong."

	I think this pig-raising method can be used as a reference for various places.

    不用粮食也能养肥猪编辑同志：
    在农村中经常可以听见这样的话：不用粮食喂猪是养不肥猪的。实际上并不如此，我区常宁县柏坊乡大益农业生产合作社社长范盛和去年就没有用粮食也养肥了猪。事情的经过是这样的：去年三月，范盛和（当时还是互助组长）曾听到在这个乡搞普选工作的李耀锡同志介绍了报纸上用粗糠、野草、生料喂猪的方法，后来他到县开人民代表大会会议时又参观了本县农场用米糠、生料喂猪的具体事实，就感觉到这个办法很不错，既节省粮食，又省人工、柴火，能降低成本，非常合算。由县回来后，他就向组员介绍自己所看到的新式养猪方法和经验。
    这个养猪方法是：首先把谷糠炒黄（不能炒黑），再用碓臼舂烂（或磨碎），把粗糠捣成细粉；以后再将切细的红薯藤堆放在缸、箱等容器里，把作酒的饼药捣烂，洒在切碎的红薯藤里（每百斤红薯藤可放半斤左右），使红薯藤发酵柔软。炒过的粗糠和发了酵的红薯藤都有一股香味，既能吸引猪爱吃，又可帮助消化。在喂猪食的时候，把发酵的红薯藤和炒过磨碎的谷糠混和调匀，再用少量米汤或开水把拌好的食荡一下，就可以给猪吃了。但放水不能过多，大致和牛食一样就行了。如果有菜饼、棉饼或豆饼放一些就更好，一般在六十斤重以下的猪，每头每天放二、三两，六十斤以上的猪，每头每天可放三、四两，这样猪吃了，长得又光又红。如没有饼，也可以不放。没有红薯藤也可用其他能养猪的青草、菜叶和捣碎的谷糠混合作生料喂养，但青草、菜叶不必用饼药发酵，只要切碎后，就可以同样拌匀加米汤或开水给猪吃。
    大家听了这个办法后，都不相信，认为他说的是瞎话，因为大家从来就没有听说过用青草、谷糠、生料可以把猪喂肥大的。范盛和心想：我一定要用事实来使他们相信，于是他买了一头四十八斤重的小猪，亲自用新方法喂养。在头两天，猪确实不爱吃，他便掺了点儿米汤，结果猪吃了，但没有吃完。他想，一定是水放多了，糠炒的过火有苦味。于是重新炒糠，少加米汤，拌成像喂牛一样的干料，这样猪果然吃了，还嫌不够似的。他非常高兴。一天一天地过去，这头小猪就和吹的一样，长的又胖又光彩，过了两个月零两天，已经长到一百零四斤，平均每天长到十三两多。这头猪没吃一粒谷子就养大了、养肥了。
    范盛和用新方法养猪成功了，全体组员看到这个具体事实，都跟着学他的办法养起猪来。原来全组十八户只有九户养猪十三头，后来全组家家都养猪了，共养了三十八头；范盛和自己养了四头。组员们都说：“过去我们太保守了，不相信先进经验，总认为不喂米养不肥猪，现在才知道这个想法是错了。”
    我觉得这个养猪办法，可供各地参考。
