Shanghai has recently dispatched numerous trains and ships loaded with large quantities of agricultural machinery and pesticides. These agricultural implements and pesticides being shipped to rural areas across the country include various types of compression sprayers, hand-cranked dusters, small spray guns, "666" insecticide powder, and "Ceresan" fungicide. The East China Supply Station of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives alone shipped over 640 tons of "666" insecticide powder to various regions in January; nearly 500 compression sprayers were supplied to Inner Mongolia.

This year, the supply station's supply of pesticides to the country will double compared to last year. Among the agricultural implements supplied this year, a new addition is a Soviet-style large sprayer capable of spraying 300 to 400 mu of farmland per day.

    上海运出大批农药械
    最近，从上海开出的许多列车和船只上，装载着大批农业药械和农药。这些运往各地农村的农业药械和农药，有压缩喷雾器、手摇喷粉器、小喷枪、“六六六”杀虫粉、“赛力散”杀虫药等多种。中华全国供销合作总社华东供销站仅在一月份就运往各地六百四十多吨“六六六”杀虫粉；供应给内蒙古的压缩喷雾器近五百具。
    今年这个供销站供应全国的农药将比去年增加一倍；今年供应的农业药械中新增添了一种每天能喷三、四百亩农田的苏联式的大型喷雾器。
