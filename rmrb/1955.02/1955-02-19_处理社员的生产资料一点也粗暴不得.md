The Handling of Members' Means of Production Must Not Be Rough At All
Han Fuwang

Our Lower Osmanthus Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in Licheng County, Shanxi Province, increased production again in 1954. The average yield of grain per mu was 284.8 jin, exceeding the original plan by 9.2%, and the income of 92.2% of the cooperative members' households exceeded that of 1953. However, the production enthusiasm of the members was not high, and there were many "strange complaints." What was going on?

This cooperative was established in the spring of 1953. At that time, there were only twenty-one households. The cooperative has increased production year after year, and the actual income of the members has increased year by year. All the villagers have seen that the agricultural production cooperative is indeed better than the mutual aid group. In the spring of 1954, it increased to one hundred and three households; after the autumn, it developed to one hundred and seventy-three households. Only three households in the village were left out. However, just as this development was going smoothly, the heads of the stationed cadres were overwhelmed by victory. Although they also said in their mouths: "We must proceed from the characteristics of the small-scale peasant economy and the existing experience to guide the peasants to advance steadily according to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit," they did not do a good job of political and ideological education, but roughly dragged the peasants to run forward.

Near the end of the autumn harvest distribution last year, they took a "no attention to detail" approach, and immediately assessed and collectivized the members' livestock, sheep, and farm tools of all sizes as "shares in the cooperative." They did not consider whether the cooperative's economic strength was sufficient, whether production urgently needed it, or whether the members' level of awareness was sufficient.

They determined the proportion of the means of production to be "assessed as shares in the cooperative": labor accounted for 62%, land accounted for 25.94%, and livestock and sheep accounted for 12.06%. After doing so, a total of 69.57 million yuan of heavy debt was placed on the members. Of the 173 households in the cooperative, in addition to 50 households that did not have these means of production at all, among the 123 households with means of production, there were 55 households whose assessed value of shares ranged from 500,000 yuan to 3.54 million yuan, accounting for 31.7% of the total number of households in the cooperative; there were 33 households with 100,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan, and 35 households with 10,000 yuan to 3,000 yuan. Among them, Gao Ansheng, who had the most means of production, had the following assessed as "shares in the cooperative": an iron cart valued at 1.7 million yuan, a donkey at 1.2 million yuan, four sheep at 340,000 yuan, a carrying basket at 7,000 yuan, a saddle set at 65,000 yuan, a carrying frame at 26,000 yuan, a rake at 120,000 yuan, a pair of night soil buckets at 45,000 yuan, a cannon rod at 8,000 yuan, a set of livestock reins and halter at 11,000 yuan, a set of yoke collars at 25,000 yuan, totaling more than 3.54 million yuan. Obviously, the assessed amount was very large and highly concentrated.

As a result, both the middle peasants and the poor peasants became uneasy. Middle peasant members felt some "heartache" at the thought of entering such a large amount of shares, and they were very worried about whether the payment would be returned to them within three years. Gao Shuikuan, a middle peasant, had a total of 1.11 million yuan of means of production assessed as shares in the cooperative, which, as far as he was concerned, was equivalent to "losing half of his family property." Of course, they were allowed to take it away when they left the cooperative; but the peasants, after all, looked at problems from reality. So they said: "We can't afford to level the 'mounds' like this." Households with no or few means of production felt they could not afford it and were also a little worried. Yang Rensheng had to pay 657,000 yuan in shares. After deducting the farm tools that were offset by the cooperative, he still had to pay 596,000 yuan; he currently owed the cooperative 320,000 yuan, totaling 916,000 yuan, which was nearly the total value of his annual income.

Not only were the means of production "assessed as shares in the cooperative" too much and too hasty, but the assessed prices were also unfair and unreasonable, which made some members even more dissatisfied. Although it took nearly two months to assess the "shares," the members were not fully mobilized to conduct debates and comparisons. Only the county cadres, township cadres, and cooperative cadres were busy calculating numbers and deducting proportions. Some comrades believed: "Since it is beneficial to the masses, a little coercion is also acceptable."

The three heads of old oxen belonging to the three middle peasant households of Zhang Shuxiang, Wang Dayu, and Wang Heyu were originally assessed at 840,000 yuan; after being taken to the cooperative for collective feeding for five or six days, these three oxen were sold to the state-owned food company for 1,194,000 yuan, an average increase of 118,000 yuan per head. Wang Dayu's wife said: "If I had known that the cooperative would take my ox to the 'slaughter pot,' I would rather die than join the cooperative." Zi Yuan's good donkey with good teeth, valued at 850,000 yuan, was also sold by the cooperative for 1.05 million yuan. What was especially incomprehensible was Gao Sanqing. Under the encouragement and support of the cadres, he sold an ox worth 860,000 yuan in July 1954, and then borrowed 700,000 yuan from the credit cooperative to buy back a good donkey for 1.58 million yuan. When it was assessed as a share in the cooperative in November of the same year, it was only assessed at 1.05 million yuan; according to the market price at that time, it was said that it could be sold for at least 1.2 million yuan. He said: "How much did I buy the livestock for? It's not right for me to lose money!" The assessed prices of farm tools were even more unreasonable. For example, the saddle used for livestock to carry things would cost more than 300,000 yuan to install according to the market price; but Gao Jiaxu's new saddle that he had just padded before the autumn was only assessed at 110,000 yuan, and Chang Qingchang's saddle that was 80% new was only assessed at 170,000 yuan.

In addition to retaining subsistence grain, the cooperative sold more than 90,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. Without the approval of the members' congress and without soliciting the opinions of the members, the cadres deposited 30 million yuan of the 40 million yuan in cash already obtained from the sale of surplus grain in the credit cooperative, and allocated more than 2 million yuan in shares to the credit cooperative. The remaining 7 million yuan in cash was distributed to the members' households according to half of the annual cash they should receive (because some grain and cotton have not been delivered yet, and the money from the sale has not been received), adopting a "matching" method. For example, Gao Yuechen was supposed to receive 1.4 million yuan in cash for the year. In addition to the 700,000 yuan that could not be paid temporarily, he was given 50,000 yuan in cash and 650,000 yuan in savings certificates. Jin Cunzhu currently owed others 500,000 yuan, but the cooperative only gave him 50,000 yuan in cash and 500,000 yuan in deposit slips. He said: "I was very happy when I harvested grain in the autumn, but now the more I think about it, the more discouraged I become." His wife then said: "Anyway, the screws are being tightened tighter and tighter!"

The cooperative has not settled the accounts of each member's household for the past year. The cooperative cadres spent and borrowed money randomly, causing greater dissatisfaction among the members. Without the approval of the members' congress, individual cadres purchased a rubber-tired cart on their own and withdrew 11 million yuan from the members' deposits to pay for it. Usually, members could withdraw as much money as they spent from the cooperative, but some members overspent 300,000 yuan; some members had more than 1 million yuan in the cooperative, but could not borrow 50,000 yuan when they were in urgent need.

The result of doing so has created a misunderstanding of socialism among many peasants in this village, a suspicion of the policies of the Party and the People's Government, and hindered the full realization of the peasants' productive potential. No one in the cooperative fed the collectively owned livestock, which made the captains and team leaders anxious. Not only were the members of this cooperative in a state of unease, but the thinking of many members of other cooperatives in the vicinity was also fluctuating.

Expanding the public property of agricultural production cooperatives and increasing the deposits and shares of credit cooperatives are undoubtedly good things, for the sake of socialism and for the long-term interests of the masses. However, if we only blindly rush to be "advanced" without adopting correct and reasonable methods and appropriate steps, and without regard to the reality of the conditions, and without carrying out arduous and in-depth political work among the masses, even with good subjective wishes, what bad results can be caused!

    处理社员的生产资料一点也粗暴不得
    韩福旺
    山西省黎城县下桂花村农业生产合作社一九五四年又增产了，每亩土地平均生产粮食二百八十四斤八两，超过原计划百分之九点二，有百分之九十二点二的社员户收入超过一九五三年。可是，社员们的生产情绪却不高，“怪话”很多。这是怎么回事呢？
    这个社是一九五三年春季建立的。当时，只有二十一户。这个社连年增产，社员实际收入逐年增多，全村农民都看到农业生产合作社确实比互助组更好。一九五四年春季，增加到一百零三户；秋后，又发展到一百七十三户。全村只剩下三户没参加。可是，就在这顺利发展的时候，驻社干部的头脑被胜利冲昏了。他们虽然口里也说：“我们要从小农经济的特点和已有的经验出发，引导农民按照自愿互利的原则稳步前进。”但是，他们没有很好地进行政治思想教育工作，却粗暴地拖着农民跑步。
    去年秋收分配将近结束时，他们来了个“眉毛胡子一把抓”，把社员的牲口、羊群、大小农具一下子都作价归公，“评股入社”。社的经济力量够不够？生产上是不是迫切需要？社员们的觉悟程度够不够？他们都没有考虑。
    他们确定了生产资料“评股入社”的比例：劳力负担百分之六十二，土地负担百分之二十五点九四，牲口羊群负担百分之十二点零六。这样做了以后，总数六千九百五十七万元的重债压到了社员们身上。全社一百七十三户，除五十户根本没有这些生产资料以外，在一百二十三户有生产资料的社员中，入股的生产资料作价在五十万元至三百五十四万元的有五十五户，占全社户数的百分之三十一点七；其余十万元至五十万元的有三十三户，十万元至三千元的有三十五户。其中生产资料最多的高安生，作价“评股入社”的生产资料计有：铁车一辆作价一百七十万元，驴一头一百二十万元，羊四只三十四万元，篓驮一个七千元，鞍架一付六万五千元，驮架一个二万六千元，耙一张十二万元，圊桶一对四万五千元，炮杆一根八千元，牲口缰绳龙头一付一万一千元，套项一套二万五千元，共计达三百五十四万多元。显然，作价的款额很大，而且是非常集中的。
    这样一来，中农和贫农社员都不安起来了。一下入那么大股金，中农社员有些“心痛”，他们还十分担忧三年内是不是能把价款归还他们。中农高水宽生产资料共评股入社一百一十一万元，在他说来，就等于“没有了半份家产”。当然，出社时还允许带走；但农民终究是从现实出发看问题的。所以他们便说了：“这样平‘堌堆’，我们可有些吃不住。”没有或少有生产资料的户，感到负担不起，也有些发愁。杨仁生负担股金六十五万七千元，除入社的农具折顶外，还得出五十九万六千元；他现下还欠社里三十二万元，两项共达九十一万六千元，将近他一年收入的总值。
    生产资料“评股入社”不但太多了太急了，而且作价也不公道不合理，这使一部分社员更加不满。虽然作价“评股”时间近两个月光景，但并没有充分发动社员群众展开争论评比，只是县干部、乡干部和社干部们忙于算数字，扣比例。有些同志认为：“既然对群众有利，强迫一点也可以。”
    张书相、王大玉、王河玉等三户中农的三头老耕牛，原作价八十四万元；牵到社里集体喂了五六天后，将这三头牛卖给国营食品公司，得价一百一十九万四千元，每头平均长钱十一万八千元。王大玉老婆说：“早知道社里拿上我的牛送了‘杀锅’，俺可死也不入社。”子元的四个牙的好驴一头，作价八十五万元，社里也把它卖了，卖价一百零五万元。尤其想不通的是高三庆。在干部的鼓励和支持下，他在一九五四年七月把值八十六万元的一头牛卖出后，又向信用社借款七十万元，花一百五十八万元买回好驴一头。赶到同年十一月作价入社时，只作了一百零五万元；按当时市场价格据说最低也能卖一百二十万元。他说：“我牲口是多少钱买的？让我赔钱，不合适吧！”农具作价更不合理。如牲口驮东西用的鞍子，按市价安装一架得三十多万元；但高甲绪秋前刚垫起的新鞍子，只作了十一万元，常庆昌的八成新鞍子，也只作价十七万元。
    除留生活粮外，这个社共卖给了国家余粮九万多斤。干部们把卖余粮已得的四千万元现款，没经过社员大会通过，没征求社员们的意见，就存在信用社三千万元，并给信用社拨了二百多万元股金。余下的七百多万元现金，按各户社员全年所应得的现金的一半（因为现下有些粮食和棉花还没交，所卖的款没取回来），采取“搭配”的方法分配给各户社员。如高月臣，一年该得现金一百四十万元，除七十万元暂时不能清付外，给了他五万元现金和六十五万元存款储蓄票。靳存柱刻下欠别人五十万元，但社里分给他的只有五万元现金和五十万元存款条。他说：“秋收打粮那时候是老高兴，现在越想越灰心。”他老婆接着说：“反正螺丝钉是越扭越紧了啊！”
    这个社一年来没有给社员各户清算过他们各自的账底。社干部乱支乱外借，引起社员更大不满。个别干部没通过社员大会，擅自购回胶皮车一辆，从社员存款中取出一千一百万元抵付。平时，社员花多少钱到社取多少，有的社员多花了三十万元；有的社员在社里存有一百多万元，急用五万元却借不出来。
    这样做的结果，已造成了这个村的许多农民对社会主义的误解，对党和人民政府政策的怀疑，阻碍了农民的生产潜在力的充分发挥。社里公有的牲口没人喂养，急得队长组长团团转。不但这个社的社员们情绪很不安，附近别的社也有不少社员的思想动荡起来了。
    扩大生产合作社的公共财产，增加信用合作社的存款和股金，无疑的，都是好事情，是为了社会主义，为了群众的长远利益。可是，如果只是盲目地抢“先进”，而不采取正确的合理的办法和适当的步骤，不顾现实的条件，不在群众中艰苦地深入地进行政治工作，即使有良好的主观愿望，也会造成多么不好的结果啊！
