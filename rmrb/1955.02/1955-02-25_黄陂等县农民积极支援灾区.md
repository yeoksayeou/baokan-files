Farmers in Huangpi and other counties actively support disaster areas
In Hubei Province's Xiaogan Special District, counties such as Jiayu and Hanchuan suffered severe flooding last year. After strong government support, they carried out a production self-salvation movement and rebuilt their homes. However, during the several heavy wind and snowstorms before and after the New Year, the disaster victims faced difficulties with firewood and feed for their cattle. To solve the difficulties of the disaster victims and protect the cattle through the winter, farmers in non-disaster areas such as Huangpi, Yingshan, and Anlu counties actively supported the disaster areas with rice straw and firewood, and helped them to feed their cattle. As of early February, farmers in non-disaster areas throughout the special district had sold 29 million jin of rice straw to farmers in disaster areas. The 13.4 million jin of firewood purchased by the non-disaster counties has also been continuously transported to the disaster areas. More than 8,600 head of cattle are being fed on behalf of others. Currently, seven counties have organized more than 100 veterinarians to treat the cattle fostered in the disaster areas.

    黄陂等县农民积极支援灾区
    湖北省孝感专区嘉鱼、汉川等县去年遭受严重水灾，后经过政府大力扶持，开展生产自救运动，重建了家园。但在年前年后的几次大风雪中，灾民在烧柴上、耕牛的饲料上又发生了困难。非灾区黄陂、应山、安陆等县农民为了解决灾民的困难，保护耕牛过冬，积极支援灾区稻草、烧柴，并帮助他们代喂耕牛。到二月初统计，全专区非灾区农民已将二千九百万斤稻草售给灾区农民。非灾区各县收购的烧柴一千三百四十万斤，也陆续运到灾区。代喂养的耕牛有八千六百多头。目前又有七个县组织了兽医一百多人替灾区寄养的耕牛治病。
