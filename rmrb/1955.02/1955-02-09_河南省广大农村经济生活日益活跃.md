    Economic life in the broad rural areas of Henan Province is becoming increasingly active. Recently, Henan Province adopted comprehensive measures to invigorate the rural economy, and the economic life in the vast rural areas is becoming more active day by day. At present, the province has systematically restored the production of a number of oil mills, and grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in many areas have paid attention to correctly guiding and widely organizing small merchants and peddlers to go deep into the countryside to carry out purchasing and sales businesses. The Bai Bi Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Anyang County, based on the actual needs of the local area, convened a forum of small merchants and peddlers who had already closed down, explained the policies to them, wholesaled goods to them, and organized them to supply goods to farmers at prices stipulated by the cooperative. Many farmers said with satisfaction, "This is much more convenient." This district also allocated raw materials to organize more than a dozen workshops to process sesame oil, tofu, and vermicelli locally. The market quickly became active, and the number of people going to market increased by two or three times.
    The grain supply work in various places has been improved. Many state grain markets have been established. The Huanglingji Grain Station in Fengqiu County strengthened the organization and planning of its work, added scales to facilitate farmers' grain purchases, and the amount of peanuts and soybeans purchased also increased several times. In the first four days of the establishment of the state grain market in Guanting, Changge County, farmers took more than 3,000 jin of grain to the market for adjustment. Due to the guaranteed grain supply, many cotton farmers in cotton-producing areas such as Luoyang, Lingbao, and Anyang are preparing to expand cotton fields according to the state plan.
    Now, the economic departments of the province are actively carrying out material supply and other work, focusing on the central task of spring plowing production. The spring plowing production materials prepared by the Henan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative system for farmers have increased by 58.9 percent compared with the same period last year.

    河南省广大农村经济生活日益活跃
    河南省最近采取了活跃农村经济生活的全面措施，广大农村的经济生活一天比一天活跃。目前，全省有计划地恢复了一批油坊的生产，不少地区的基层供销合作社注意了正确领导与广泛组织小商、小贩深入乡村开展收购和销售业务。安阳县白壁供销合作社根据当地的实际需要，召集了一些已经歇业的小商贩开座谈会，对他们讲明政策，给他们批发货物，组织他们按照合作社规定的价格对农民供应货物。许多农民满意地说：“这样就方便了。”这个区还拨出原料组织十几户作坊就地加工香油、豆腐和粉条，市场上很快活跃起来，赶集人数增加了两三倍。
    各地粮食供应工作有了改进。不少国家粮食市场已经建立起来。封邱县黄陵集售粮站加强工作的组织性和计划性，增添磅秤，便利了农民买粮，收购花生、大豆的数量也增加几倍。长葛县官亭建立国家粮食市场的头四天中，农民拿到市场上调剂的粮食就有三千多斤。洛阳、灵宝、安阳等棉产区由于保证了粮食供应，不少棉农都在准备根据国家计划扩大棉田。
    现在，全省经济部门正在围绕着春耕生产这一中心任务，积极开展物资供应等工作。河南省供销合作社系统为农民准备的春耕生产资料，比去年同时期增加了百分之五十八点九。（本报河南记者站）
