Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association held its 13th enlarged meeting on the 5th and 7th, discussing the work plan for 1955. It decided to organize the report and study of the Second All-Soviet Writers Congress and to launch a criticism of Hu Feng's bourgeois idealist literary thought.

The meeting was attended by: Mao Dun, Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association; Zhou Yang, Ding Ling, Ba Jin, Lao She, Feng Xuefeng, Shao Quanlin, Vice Chairmen; heads of various working departments and editorial offices of the Chinese Writers Association, and heads of the six branches of the Chinese Writers Association in Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Shenyang, and Xi'an: Sha Ting, Liu Baiyu, Xiao San, Chen Baichen, Nie Gannu, Yan Wenjing, Kang Tuo, Wu Boxiao, Shao Zinan, Zeng Ke, Zheng Boqi, Hu Cai, Cao Ming, Shi Tianshou, Yu Heiding, Ouyang Shan, Wu Qiang, Fang Ji, and writers Zhao Shuli, Ai Qing, Yuan Shuipai, etc.

The meeting first listened to the reports by Zhou Yang, Ding Ling, Lao She, and others on their participation in the Second All-Soviet Writers Congress. Zhou Yang and others stated in their reports that the Second All-Soviet Writers Congress was a milestone not only in the development of Soviet literature but also in the development of progressive literature worldwide. The congress summarized the rich experience of Soviet literature over the past 20 years, put forward the future creative tasks of Soviet literature, and marked the united spirit of all Soviet writers striving to improve the ideological and artistic level of literature. While fully estimating the great achievements of Soviet literature, the congress also conducted serious criticism and self-criticism of the shortcomings and backward phenomena in literary work. The congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the CPSU to the congress stipulated a fighting program for the further development of Soviet literature, which can be said to be a guide for progressive literature worldwide. The congress further explained and developed the method of socialist realism in literature. Socialist realism has now become the common method of progressive literature worldwide. The congress emphasized the principle of communist party spirit in literature, believing that the method of socialist realism is closely combined with the Marxist-Leninist world outlook; promoted the connection between socialist realist literature and the traditions of national literature; and promoted that socialist realism should ensure the diversity of literary forms and styles, and allow free competition of different literary schools on a common ideological basis. The congress discussed how to create positive characters, how to express the spiritual world of Soviet people in many ways, and how to correctly criticize hostile and backward negative phenomena in satirical works. The congress also summarized the experience of the Soviet literature in the theoretical struggle against various hostile thoughts in the past 20 years. The congress unanimously affirmed the important role of the Soviet Writers Union organization. One of the deep impressions of the congress on foreign writers representatives was that Soviet writers showed a high degree of internationalism to foreign brother writers. They proposed not only to use their outstanding creative achievements and advanced experience as a demonstration of world progressive literature, but also to absorb all the valuable experiences of modern world progressive writers in creative activities.

After listening to the reports from Zhou Yang and others, the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association believed that studying the documents of the Second All-Soviet Writers Congress was of great significance to the development of China's literary and art undertakings. The meeting decided that the Chinese Writers Association and local branches should organize reports on the Second All-Soviet Writers Congress, conduct studies among writers and literary cadres, to improve literary and artistic thinking and improve current literary and artistic work. The meeting decided that the Chinese Writers Association should strengthen its ties with Soviet writers in the future and strengthen the translation, introduction, and research of Soviet literature.

The meeting then discussed carrying out the ideological struggle against bourgeois idealism in the literary field. The meeting pointed out that from the criticism of bourgeois viewpoints in the "Dream of the Red Chamber" research to the criticism of Hu Shi's thought, the academic and literary circles began the struggle against bourgeois idealist thought and created an atmosphere for academic discussion. The meeting exchanged views especially on the criticism of Hu Feng's literary thought that is currently underway. The meeting pointed out: Hu Feng's literary thought is bourgeois idealist. He believes that literature and art are not reflections of objective reality, but expressions of his so-called "subjective spirit" or the writer's "sincerity." He regards literary creation as the "combination or integration" of "subjective spirit" and "objective truth." Creation is the writer's use of "subjective spirit" to "embrace" the world, that is, his so-called "self-expansion." In this way, he elevates the role of the writer's so-called "subjective spirit" to a higher than all, decisive position. He obliterates the guiding role of Marxism-Leninism for writers, and he fundamentally opposes advocating that writers study Marxism-Leninism in order to deeply understand reality on the basis of mastering the Marxist-Leninist world outlook. He believes that Marxism-Leninism is a "cold" thing and destroys creation. He promotes the theory of "life is everywhere" to make writers close themselves in their own small world and leave the lives and struggles of the broad masses of people. He believes that the literary world advocates that revolutionary writers should have a communist worldview, advocate that writers go deep into the lives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, advocate writers' ideological transformation, advocate the national form of literary works, and advocate writing about important themes, which are "five knives" inserted in the heads of writers and readers. Hu Feng's literary thought is obviously completely opposed to Marxist literary views and the policy of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers as instructed by Chairman Mao. Hu Feng's so-called "realism" is precisely anti-realism, especially against socialist realism. He has long promoted his bourgeois idealist thoughts under the guise of Marxism and formed a small group to confront the literary team composed of party and non-party progressive writers under the leadership of the Communist Party. His propositions on the mode of literary activities are actually to abolish the unified leadership of the Writers Association and make the literary movement a fragmented sectarian activity. The meeting held that Hu Feng's erroneous literary thoughts and actions not only had a negative impact on the progressive literary cause in the past, but also posed a harmful obstacle to the future development of socialist realist literature. The meeting decided to launch a thorough and comprehensive criticism of Hu Feng's erroneous theory to improve the level of Marxist literary thought, strengthen the unity of the literary world, and better serve the country's general line.

The meeting discussed the work direction and plan of the Chinese Writers Association in 1955 and decided to take the launch of the struggle against bourgeois idealist thought in the literary field, the launch of free competition in creation, the strengthening of the collective leadership of the Writers Association, and the strengthening of the connection between the head office and local branches as the central tasks of the association's work in 1955. The meeting made appropriate adjustments to the selection of heads of various working departments of the Chinese Writers Association. Liu Baiyu was appointed Director of the Creation Committee, Li Ji was appointed Deputy Director, Yang Shuo was appointed Deputy Director of the Foreign Literature Committee, and Ma Feng was appointed Deputy Director of the Popularization Work Department. In addition, the meeting proposed that the association should strengthen the political and moral education of its members in the future, resolutely fight against the phenomenon of moral corruption of writers, and decided to expel individual morally corrupt member writers from the association.

    中国作家协会主席团开扩大会议
    决定组织关于全苏作家代表大会的传达和学习
    并决定展开对胡风的资产阶级唯心主义文艺思想的批判
    【新华社十一日讯】中国作家协会主席团在五日和七日举行了第十三次扩大会议，讨论一九五五年工作计划，决定组织关于第二次全苏作家代表大会的传达报告和学习，并决定展开对胡风的资产阶级唯心主义文艺思想的批判。
    出席会议的有：中国作家协会主席茅盾，副主席周扬、丁玲、巴金、老舍、冯雪峰、邵荃麟，中国作家协会所属各工作部门、各刊物编辑部的负责人和中国作家协会上海、武汉、广州、重庆、沈阳、西安六个分会的负责人沙汀、刘白羽、萧三、陈白尘、聂绀弩、严文井、康濯、吴伯萧、邵子南、曾克、郑伯奇、胡采、草明、师田手、于黑丁、欧阳山、吴强、方纪和作家赵树理、艾青、袁水拍等。
    会议首先听取了周扬、丁玲、老舍等关于赴苏联参加第二次全苏作家代表大会经过的汇报。周扬等在汇报中说明：第二次全苏作家代表大会不但在苏联文学而且在全世界进步文学的发展上都具有里程碑的意义；大会总结了二十年来苏联文学的丰富经验，提出了苏联文学今后的创造任务，标志了全体苏联作家为提高文学的思想和艺术水平而斗争的团结一致的精神。大会一方面对苏联文学的巨大成就作了充分估计，同时对文学工作中的缺点和落后现象也进行了严正的批评和自我批评。苏共中央给大会的祝词规定了进一步发展苏联文学的战斗纲领，这个纲领可以说是全世界进步文学的指南。大会对文学的社会主义现实主义方法，作了进一步的解释和发挥。社会主义现实主义现在已成为全世界进步文学的共同方法。大会强调地宣传了文学中的共产主义党性的原则，认为社会主义现实主义方法和马克思列宁主义的世界观是密切结合的；宣传了社会主义现实主义文学和本民族文学传统的联系；宣传了社会主义现实主义应当保证文学的形式和风格的多样化，在共同思想基础上容许不同风格的文学流派的自由竞赛。大会讨论了如何创造正面人物，如何多方面地表现苏维埃人的精神世界，以及如何在讽刺作品中正确地抨击敌对的和落后的反面现象等问题。大会又总结了二十年来苏联文学对各种敌对思想所进行的理论斗争的经验。大会一致肯定了苏联作家协会组织的重要作用。大会给外国作家代表的深刻印象之一，是苏联作家对外国兄弟作家表现了高度国际主义精神，他们提出了不但要以自己的卓越的创造成就和先进经验作为世界进步文学的示范，而且也要吸取现代世界进步作家在创作活动上的一切宝贵经验。
    中国作家协会主席团听了周扬等的汇报后，认为学习第二次全苏作家代表大会的文件，对发展我国文学艺术事业具有极大的意义。会议决定由中国作家协会和各地分会组织关于第二次全苏作家代表大会的传达报告，在作家及文学干部中进行学习，借以提高文艺思想和改进当前的文艺工作。会议决定今后应加强中国作家协会和苏联作家的联系，加强对苏联文学的翻译、介绍和研究工作。
    会议接着就开展文艺领域中对资产阶级唯心主义的思想斗争进行了讨论。会议指出从批判“红楼梦”研究中的资产阶级观点到胡适思想批判，在学术界文艺界开始了对资产阶级唯心主义思想的斗争，并造成了学术讨论的空气。会议特别就目前正在开始的对胡风文艺思想的批判交换了意见。会议指出：胡风的文艺思想是资产阶级唯心主义的，他认为文艺不是客观真实的反映，而是他所谓的“主观精神”或是作家的“真诚”的表现，他把文艺创作看成是“主观精神”和“客观真理”的“结合或融合”，创作就是作家用“主观精神”去“拥抱”世界，也就是他所谓作家的“自我扩张”，这样，他就把作家的所谓“主观精神”的作用提到高于一切，决定一切的地位。他抹煞马克思列宁主义对于作家的指导作用，他根本反对要在作家中提倡学习马克思列宁主义，以便在掌握马克思列宁主义的世界观的基础上去深入地理解现实。他认为马克思列宁主义是“冷冰冰”的东西，是破坏创作的。他宣传“到处有生活”的理论，来使作家把自己关闭在自己的小天地里，而离开广大人民群众的生活和斗争。他认为文艺界提倡革命作家应有共产主义世界观，提倡作家深入工农兵生活，提倡作家思想改造，提倡文艺作品的民族形式，提倡描写有重要意义的题材，是插在作家和读者头上的“五把刀子”。胡风的这种文艺思想，显然是和马克思主义的文艺观点和毛主席所指示的文艺为工农兵服务的方针完全对立的。胡风的所谓“现实主义”恰好是反现实主义的，特别是反对社会主义现实主义的。他长期地在马克思主义外衣的掩盖下宣传他的资产阶级唯心主义的思想，并形成一个小集团，来和在共产主义思想以及共产党领导下由党和非党进步作家所组成的文学队伍相对抗。他的关于文学活动方式的主张，实际上就是要取消作家协会的统一领导，使文学运动成为四分五裂的宗派活动。会议认为胡风的这种错误的文艺思想和行动表现，不仅给了过去进步的文艺事业以消极影响，而且对今后社会主义现实主义文艺的发展更是一种有害的阻碍。会议决定对胡风的错误理论展开彻底的全面的批判，以提高马克思主义文艺思想水平，加强文艺界的团结，更好地为国家的总路线服务。
    会议讨论了中国作家协会一九五五年的工作方向和计划，决定以开展文艺领域内反对资产阶级唯心主义思想的斗争，开展创作上的自由竞赛，加强作家协会的集体领导和加强总会与各地分会的联系作为协会一九五五年工作的中心任务。会议就中国作家协会各工作部门负责人选作了适当调整，决定刘白羽任创作委员会主任，李季为副主任，杨朔任外国文学委员会副主任，马烽任普及工作部副部长。此外，会议提出了协会今后应加强会员的政治道德教育，对作家道德堕落现象进行坚决斗争，并决定了开除个别道德堕落的会员作家的会籍。
