On the second day of the 1955 National Ice Sports Meet, the brilliant "game performance" by the Harbin Children's Ice Performance Team left a deep impression on the audience.

As the performance began, thirty-three young athletes in red and green costumes skated into the performance area to the accompaniment of pleasant music. The young athletes were dressed as cats, fish, rabbits, eagles, and chicks.

After the "game performance" warm-up, they first performed "Kittens Fishing." Four children dressed as fish performed beautiful balancing and other movements in a circle symbolizing a pool, as if the fish were swimming in the water. Then they performed a story about the transformation of playful kittens and naughty rabbits.

The second program performed by the young ice skaters was "Eagle Catches Chicks." They used this performance to tell the audience how they unite and help each other, love the collective, and hate the enemy. These young athletes performed a scene of a hen playing with a group of chicks and several rabbits and cats. Suddenly, a fierce eagle flew over, and it looked like it was about to eat the chicks. But the hen, cats, and rabbits united and finally captured the eagle. These young athletes are outstanding students from nine elementary schools, ranging in age from eight to fifteen, and all are Young Pioneers. All of these children have at least two years of skating experience, and some are veterans with more than five years of skating experience. Song Renjie, who plays the eagle, is only twelve years old this year, and he started skating at the age of seven. His skilled skating performance is captivating. Ren Puhua, who plays the kitten, and Ma Wanyun are respectively in the second grade of Jingwei Elementary School and the third grade of Majie Elementary School in Harbin. Eight-year-old Ren Puhua has often carried her small skates to school in winter for the past two years, and she skates with her friends during extracurricular activities. Last semester, she got five points in every subject and was twice selected as a "well-rounded" student in her class. Nine-year-old Ma Wanyun also has three years of skating experience, and she ranked fourth in the exam last semester.

Among these young athletes, there are also three students from the Northeast Martyrs' Children's Elementary School. The state has opened a large ice rink in this school. Ice sports have become the children's favorite sports activity in winter.

    冰上小运动员的精采表演
    新华社记者　杨淑卿　任永达　邹士芬
    在一九五五年全国冰上运动大会的第二天，哈尔滨市少年儿童冰上表演队的精采“游戏表演”给观众留下了深刻的印象。
    表演开始，三十三名穿着红绿衣裙的小运动员，在悦耳的音乐伴奏声中滑进了表演场。小运动员们化装成猫、鱼和小兔、老鹰和小鸡。
    他们进行“游戏表演”的准备活动后，首先表演了“小猫钓鱼”。四名化装成鱼儿的孩子，在象征着水池的圆圈里表演了平衡等优美动作，好像鱼儿正在水里游泳。接着他们表演了贪玩的小猫和顽皮的小兔转变的故事。
    冰上小运动员表演的第二个节目是“老鹰捉小鸡”。他们用这个表演告诉观众：他们如何团结互助、热爱集体和憎恨敌人。这些小运动员表演着一只母鸡带着一群鸡雏和几只兔子、猫在一起游戏。突然一只凶狠的老鹰飞来，眼看着就要吃鸡雏了。可是母鸡、猫和兔子们团结起来，终于把老鹰擒住了。这些小运动员是从九所小学校里选拔出来的八岁到十五岁的优秀学生，他们全是少年先锋队队员。这些孩子们至少都有二年以上的滑冰历史，有的已是有五年以上滑冰经验的老手了。扮演老鹰的宋仁杰今年才十二岁，他从七岁时就开始滑冰。他熟练的滑冰表演引人入胜。扮演小猫的任溥华和马婉云分别在哈尔滨市经纬小学二年级和马街小学三年级里读书。八岁的任溥华两年来在冬季经常背着小冰鞋去上学，到课外活动时间就和小朋友们在一起滑冰。上学期她每门功课都得了五分，曾两次被选为班里“全面发展”的学生。九岁的马婉云也有三年的滑冰历史了，她在上学期的考试中得了第四名。
    这些小运动员中还有三个是东北烈士子弟小学校的学生。国家在这所学校里开辟了一个很大的冰场。冰上运动已成为孩子们冬季最爱好的体育活动了。
