Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 7th: Pyongyang held a ceremony on the 5th to celebrate the completion of the Xipingyang, Gaoyuan, and Dingzhou railway engine sections, rebuilt with Chinese assistance. Marshal Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people, wrote a letter congratulating the conference. Kim Tu-bong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of North Korea, attended the meeting and awarded various medals to meritorious personnel of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Corps who built these three engine sections. Vice Premier of the North Korean Cabinet, Park Ui-wan, Minister of Transportation, Kim Hoe-il, and representatives of the Volunteer Army Railway Corps attended the ceremony. The Chinese railway delegation, led by Liu Jianzhang, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways of the People's Republic of China, was invited to Pyongyang to attend the ceremony and congratulate the completion of the three engine sections.

The newly built three engine sections were all built according to new designs. The three engine sections have a total of 20,000 square meters of garage area (i.e., factories for repairing and preparing locomotives), more than 8,400 square meters of auxiliary buildings, more than 9,600 meters of upper and lower water pipeline, more than 16 kilometers of trackage, and various equipment for water supply, coal supply, and sand supply. These three engine sections all have the ability to carry out various types of repairs to railway locomotives, which will play a major role in the reconstruction of the war-damaged railway system in northern Korea.

China supplied the main building materials for these three engine sections, and a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army Railway Corps undertook the specific construction tasks. During the construction period, in order to help the Korean people restore and develop the post-war people's economy as soon as possible, the commanders and fighters of the Volunteer Army Railway Corps carried out selfless labor with a fighting spirit. Soldier Cao Yilin created a record of digging nine cubic meters of earth in one day. Soldier Feng Quanbao manufactured a tool for bending steel bars, which increased work efficiency by more than two times. Last winter, when the project entered a tense stage, in the weather of strong winds and heavy snow, the soldiers worked day and night in shifts and launched labor competitions. Some insisted on digging inspection pits in the repair garage in knee-deep icy water, and some climbed onto the roof of the garage, more than 20 meters high, to carry out concrete pouring work. Finally, they overcame the difficulties and completed all construction work as planned in January this year.

During the project, the Korean railway department and the Korean people gave timely and strong support to the Volunteer Army Railway Corps. The Korean railway department made pipe fittings such as reducers and tees for the construction of the Xipingyang engine section and supplied the engineering needs in a timely manner.

    我国协助朝鲜重建的三个铁路机务段落成
　　平壤举行庆祝典礼并授予志愿军铁道部队有功人员勋章
    【新华社平壤七日电】平壤在五日举行了庆祝中国协助重建的西平壤、高原、定州三个铁路机务段的落成典礼。朝鲜人民领袖金日成元帅写信向大会祝贺。朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会委员长金枓奉到会授予修建这三个机务段的中国人民志愿军铁道部队某部有功人员以各种勋章。朝鲜内阁副首相朴义琓、交通相金会一，志愿军铁道部队的代表们都参加了典礼。我国铁路代表团应邀在中华人民共和国铁道部副部长刘建章率领下来到平壤参加典礼，并祝贺三个机务段的落成。
    新建成的三个机务段都是按照新式设计修建的。三个机务段共建筑了两万平方公尺面积的车库（即修理、整备机车的厂房），八千四百多平方公尺面积的附属房屋，九千六百多公尺长的上下水道管路，十六公里多长的股道以及给水给煤给砂的各种设备等。这三个机务段都具有对铁道机车进行机务段各种修理的能力，对朝鲜北部被战争破坏了的铁道系统的重建将起很大的作用。
    中国供给了这三个机务段的主要建筑材料，中国人民志愿军铁道部队某部担负了具体的修建任务。在修筑期间，志愿军铁道部队的指战员们为了帮助朝鲜人民尽快地恢复发展战后人民经济，以战斗的精神进行忘我的劳动。战士曹以林创造了一天挖土九立方公尺的纪录。战士冯全保制造了一种弯钢筋的工具，把工作效率提高了两倍多。去年冬天，工程进入紧张阶段，在大风雪的天气里，战士们日夜轮班，展开了劳动竞赛，有的在深及膝盖的冰冷的水里，坚持挖修车库中的检查坑，有的爬上二十多公尺高的车库房顶，进行混凝土浇灌工程，终于战胜了困难，按计划在今年一月间完成了全部建筑工程。
    在工程进行中，朝鲜铁道部门和朝鲜人民给了志愿军铁道部队以及时的大力的支援。朝鲜铁道部门为修建西平壤机务段做了异径管、三通管等管道，及时地供应了工程上的需要。
