Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 23rd: According to the Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong, Major General Li Xiangchao, Senior Member of the Korean-Chinese side to the Military Armistice Commission, sent a letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on February 22nd, exposing the U.S. attempt to cover up U.S. aircraft's crimes of violating the Armistice Agreement by slandering the Korean-Chinese side for violating the Armistice Agreement. The letter pointed out that the U.S.'s unreasonable request for the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to dispatch three mobile neutral nations inspection teams to six locations within the Korean-Chinese side's territory was hastily fabricated when the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission dispatched a mobile neutral nations inspection team to investigate the U.S. aircraft's violation of the Armistice Agreement on February 5, 1955.

The letter, after detailing the fact that the Korean-Chinese side possessed various types of combat aircraft during the war, stated: Our side has always strictly abided by the Armistice Agreement. The necessary war materials imported by our side have always been imported through the ports designated in the Armistice Agreement. When importing war materials, our side has always notified the neutral nations inspection teams stationed at the ports in advance, and they have always fully supervised and inspected them. The fact that our side has always strictly abided by the Armistice Agreement when importing war materials has been proven by the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and its neutral nations inspection teams and their documents.

After the armistice, in accordance with our side's consistent policy of seeking peace, many military personnel and equipment in our area have been withdrawn from Korea. This is a well-known fact, and the United Nations Command itself has acknowledged this fact. Therefore, no one will believe the United Nations Command's claim that our side illegally imported war materials. Concrete facts prove that the United Nations Command is the notorious violator of the Armistice Agreement.

The letter listed the U.S.'s continuous violations of the Armistice Agreement since the armistice, and stated: No matter how the United Nations Command quibbles, it cannot deny or refute these facts.

The letter pointed out: Since the signing of the Armistice Agreement, whenever the United Nations Command's crimes of violating the Armistice Agreement have been exposed, it has repeatedly made some demands to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission that are not in accordance with the Armistice Agreement by reversing black and white and fabricating facts, and has therefore been rejected. And now, when the crimes of the United Nations Command's aircraft violating the Armistice Agreement are exposed, it is repeating its past tricks, making some groundless and unreasonable demands to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission that exceed the limits stipulated in the Armistice Agreement.

Obviously, this is a despicable attempt by the United Nations Command. Because the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, based on our side's legitimate request, dispatched a mobile neutral nations inspection team to the United Nations Command's crime scene to investigate, it hurriedly attempted to reverse black and white, shift the responsibility to our side, in order to cover up its own crimes, evade responsibility, and slander our side in turn, deceiving the world's fair public opinion.

The letter continued: Equally obvious, this is a cunning conspiracy to mock and undermine the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission by using the Armistice Agreement as an excuse to make absurd demands that do not conform to the Armistice Agreement. Everyone knows that the United Nations Command has always attempted to undermine the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles once publicly stated that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission would be abolished, and General Hull, Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, announced that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission should be "dissolved." The United Nations Command is now repeating its old tricks once again, merely demonstrating that it has consistently attempted to undermine the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Major General Li Xiangchao concluded: I am confident that the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission will not be mocked by the United Nations Command's absurd statements that reverse right and wrong or its shameful actions.

### 李相朝将军致函中立国监察委员会  揭露美方掩盖违反停战协定罪行的阴谋

    李相朝将军致函中立国监察委员会
    揭露美方掩盖违反停战协定罪行的阴谋
    【新华社平壤二十三日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将二月二十二日向中立国监察委员会提出了一封信，揭露美方企图用诽谤朝中方面违反停战协定来掩盖美方飞机违反停战协定罪行的阴谋，指出美方所提出的由中立国监察委员会派遣三个机动中立国视察小组到朝中方面境内六个地点的无理要求，是在中立国监察委员会派遣一个机动中立国视察小组调查美方飞机在一九五五年二月五日违反停战协定的事件的时候慌慌忙忙地制造出来的。
    信件在详细说明了朝中方面在战争时期就拥有各种类型的作战飞机的事实后说：我方始终严格遵守停战协定。我方所运入的必要的作战物资，一向是通过停战协定中指定的口岸运入的。我方在运入作战物资时，一向在事先通知驻在口岸的中立国视察小组，并且一向由他们充分进行了监督和视察。我方在运入作战物资时一向严格遵守停战协定的事实，已经为中立国监察委员会及其中立国视察小组和它们的文件所证明。
    在停战以后，按照我方始终不渝地谋求和平的政策，我方地区的许多军事人员和装备已经撤出朝鲜，这是人人都知道的事实，联合国军司令部方面本身也承认这个事实。因此，联合国军司令部方面所谓我方非法运入作战物资的说法，是谁也不会相信的。具体的事实证明：联合国军司令部方面才是罪恶昭彰的停战协定的违反者。
    信件列举了美方自从停战以来不断违反停战协定的事实，并且说：联合国军司令部方面不管怎样诡辩也不能够否认和反驳这些事实。
    信件指出：自从停战协定签订以后，每当联合国军司令部方面违反停战协定的罪行被揭露时，它便用颠倒黑白和捏造事实的办法，一再向中立国监察委员会提出一些不符合停战协定的要求，因此一直遭到了拒绝。而现在，当联合国军司令部方面的飞机违反停战协定的罪行被揭露时，它又重施过去的惯技，向中立国监察委员会提出一些超出停战协定规定限度以外的毫无根据的无理要求。
    显然，这是联合国军司令部方面的一个卑鄙的企图。由于中立国监察委员会根据我方的正当要求派遣一个机动中立国视察小组到联合国军司令部方面的犯罪地点去调查，它便慌慌忙忙地企图颠倒黑白，把责任推给我方，以便掩盖它自己的罪行，逃避责任，并反口污蔑我方，欺骗世界的公正舆论。
    信件接着说：同样明显的，这是一个以停战协定为借口提出不符合于停战协定的荒谬的要求来嘲弄和破坏中立国监察委员会的狡猾阴谋。人人都知道，联合国军司令部方面向来就企图破坏中立国监察委员会。美国国务卿杜勒斯曾经公开地声称中立国监察委员会将被撤销，联合国军司令部总司令赫尔将军曾宣布，中立国监察委员会应予“解散”。联合国军司令部方面现在又一次重施它的惯技，只不过再次表明了它是一贯地企图破坏中立国监察委员会的。李相朝中将最后说：我确信，中立国监察委员会决不会被联合国军司令部方面的颠倒是非的荒谬的说法或它的可耻的行径所嘲弄。
