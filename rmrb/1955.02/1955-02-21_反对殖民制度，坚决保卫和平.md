The World Federation of Democratic Youth and the International Student Union have proposed that February 21st each year be designated as "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism." This day of great significance has become a milestone in the vigorous development of the anti-colonial national liberation movement. The past year has recorded new major victories for the people of all countries against imperialist colonial rule. Today, all progressive people see that the future of the national liberation movement, in which they actively participate and support, is infinitely bright.

The struggle of the people of all countries against imperialist enslavement and aggression has reached an unprecedented scale, and it is powerfully influencing the changes and development of the international situation. In Asia, which has historically suffered from imperialist trampling and bullying, the situation is particularly exciting. The People's Republic of China, which defeated imperialist feudal rule only a few years ago, has become a powerful country and has proven itself to be an important factor for world people in maintaining peace and opposing colonialism. The historic victory won by the Korean people in the war against U.S. imperialist aggression has greatly encouraged all nations suffering from imperialist colonial oppression. The people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have achieved a major victory in the war against colonialism and are rapidly building and strengthening their country and continuing to fight for the restoration of Vietnam's complete independence and unification. As one of the important developments in post-war Asia, India, Indonesia, and Burma, important Asian countries that have freed themselves from the shackles of colonial rule, have become new factors in strengthening the cause of world peace, playing an increasingly important role in promoting international friendly cooperation. In some places where national independence has not yet been achieved, the people are continuing their national struggle for liberation with more firm will and conviction. The old Asia, which was arbitrarily manipulated and enslaved by imperialism, is a thing of the past.

In the Middle East and Near East, the broad masses of people are waging a heroic struggle to break free from imperialist oppression and plunder, and the national liberation movement is constantly growing. Some countries in this region that cherish their independence are also opposing foreign countries imposing aggressive military blocs on them. The so-called "Dark Continent" of Africa, most of which is still under colonial rule, has also dawned. In Latin America, which is under strict control by U.S. imperialism, the people's calls for freedom and independence and against imperialist enslavement are becoming more and more widespread, causing serious anxiety to North American colonialism.

The development of history is very clear. The era in which imperialism could enslave the people of all countries at will is gone forever. The chains of colonialism are breaking in many places. In many countries, people are beginning to arrange their own development according to their own will, not the will of imperialism. And there are more people in more countries marching towards the same path. No force can stop them.

It is precisely this development of the situation that makes the imperialist colonizers shudder and become restless. The imperialist colonial group, headed by the United States, is unwilling to see the disintegration of its colonial system. They refuse to recognize the changes in the world, are extremely hostile to the people's independent and autonomous movements, and try to maintain the colonial system that is already riddled with holes, and even fantasize about restoration, restoring their colonial rule over the people who have gained independence. In order to achieve this arrogant goal, the United States provokes the peace and independence of the people of all countries, infringes on the sovereignty of other countries everywhere, interferes in the internal affairs of other countries, establishes military blocs and military bases, creates tense situations, and prepares for large-scale wars. On the one hand, the United States supports other colonial countries in suppressing national liberation movements in colonies, and on the other hand, it shamelessly uses the guise of "anti-colonialism" to cover up its activities of expanding its new colonial rule to all parts of the world. The U.S. monopoly capital group is trying to take all colonies into its own hands in order to establish a huge American colonial empire. Wherever there is a national liberation movement, there is U.S. interference, suppression, and even armed aggression. The United States has become the most hypocritical and most ferocious enemy of all freedom-loving people, and the most reactionary fortress of the increasingly disintegrating colonial system.

In Asia, the United States and its followers signed the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" to stifle the increasingly powerful Asian national liberation movement and to drive those countries that depend on the United States to follow it in military adventures against the People's Republic of China and other independent countries in Asia. This is a thorough plan of U.S. colonialists. As Mangunsarkoro, First Vice Chairman of the Indonesian Nationalist Party, said: "The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization reflects a new form of foreign colonialists ruling Southeast Asian countries." On February 23, the United States and other countries participating in the Southeast Asia Group will hold a meeting of this imperialist aggressive bloc in Bangkok. There are already many indications that the purpose of holding this meeting is to intensify the implementation of various military, political, and economic aggressions against the Asian people planned by the United States, to conspire to undermine the Geneva Conference agreements, and to block the movement of the Asian people to strive for peace and national independence. Therefore, this new plan of the colonialists cannot but arouse the serious attention of the Asian people.

It must be particularly emphasized that the U.S. aggressive activities in the Taiwan area of ​​China. This is the most blatant manifestation of U.S. imperialism's attempt to overthrow the People's Republic of China and restore U.S. colonial rule over the Chinese people. The United States clings to the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek clique that has long been spurned by the Chinese people, openly occupies Taiwan and other Chinese islands, armed interference in China's internal affairs, conducts military provocations, uses war threats to intimidate the Chinese people, and even directly participates in the military activities of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. They are also plotting conspiracies to create "two Chinas" or a "Taiwan independent country" in an attempt to split China's territory and prepare for new wars.

The Chinese people have already defeated the long-term colonial rule of U.S. imperialism and won a historic victory in the great struggle for national liberation. There is no doubt that we will certainly be able to achieve victory in the struggle to liberate Taiwan and safeguard our sovereignty and territorial integrity. No one can reverse the wheels of history, and no intimidation or deception can shake the Chinese people's firm determination to liberate Taiwan.

Kichlu, a famous Indian peace advocate, is right when he says that the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is the struggle of the whole world against colonialism and for freedom. This struggle must be carried through to the end. Otherwise, it will fuel the arrogance of colonialism. It will not only burn the Chinese people, but also the people of other Asian countries. In today's situation where the United States is carrying out crazy aggression everywhere, the struggle to safeguard national sovereignty is inseparable from the struggle to safeguard peace. Only by resolutely resisting imperialist aggression and defending one's own sovereignty can peace be defended. It is precisely because the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is also a struggle to defend peace and national independence in Asia that it has received the warm support of all peace-loving and freedom-loving people in Asia. Recently, the "U.S. Get Out of Taiwan Day" held by the Indian people has demonstrated the unity and friendship established by the people of Asian countries in the common struggle to safeguard peace and freedom.

Today, all peace-loving and freedom-loving people are even more excitedly welcoming the upcoming Asian-African Conference. This international conference where Asian and African people are discussing their own problems for the first time in history vividly reflects the tremendous changes that have taken place in Asia and Africa. The vast majority of the people in Asia and Africa can no longer tolerate the arbitrary slaughter and manipulation of imperialism. Striving for and safeguarding independence and freedom and opposing the colonial system have become the common aspirations of the people of all countries. However, the colonialist aggressive group describes this just desire of the people of all countries as "communist aggression," while describing all their own aggressive acts as "preventing communism." This cannot deceive anyone. As Indonesian Prime Minister Sastroamidjojo pointed out: "Anti-colonialism and anti-imperialism are not slogans exclusively occupied by communists, but living realities in the hearts of the broad masses of people in Asia and Africa." The Asian-African Conference will provide a good opportunity to contribute to the Asian and African peoples' opposition to colonialism, peaceful coexistence, and the promotion of friendly cooperation.

The colonial era is over. The death knell of the colonial system has long been sounded. The struggle against colonialism and for national independence is a just cause supported by countries that cherish their independence and by all progressive people. The struggle of the people of all countries that are still under colonial oppression and are subjected to imperialist aggression will surely be victorious. As long as the people of all countries persist in their struggle, and constantly strengthen and expand the unity among all peace-loving and freedom-loving people, imperialist colonial rule and aggression will surely be crushed.

### 反对殖民制度，坚决保卫和平

    反对殖民制度，坚决保卫和平
    世界民主青年联盟和国际学生联合会倡议在每年二月二十一日举行“反对殖民制度斗争日”。这个具有重大意义的日子已经成为反殖民主义的民族解放运动蓬勃发展的里程碑。过去的一年，又记载了各国人民反对帝国主义殖民统治的新的重大胜利。今天，全体进步人民都看到，他们所积极参加和支持的民族解放运动的前途是无限光明的。
    各国人民反抗帝国主义奴役和侵略的斗争已经达到空前广大的规模，它正有力地影响着国际形势的变化和发展。在历史上饱受帝国主义践踏和欺凌的亚洲，情形特别令人兴奋。打败了帝国主义封建主义统治才不过几年的中华人民共和国，已经成为一个强大的国家，它已经证明自己是世界人民维护和平和反对殖民主义的重要因素。朝鲜人民在反对美帝国主义侵略的战争中所赢得的历史性胜利，给一切遭受帝国主义殖民压迫的民族带来极大的鼓舞。越南民主共和国人民取得了反对殖民主义的战争的重大胜利，正在迅速建设壮大自己的国家并为恢复越南全部独立和统一而继续斗争。作为战后亚洲的重要发展之一，摆脱了殖民统治的桎梏的印度和印度尼西亚、缅甸这些亚洲重要国家，已经成为加强世界和平事业中的新因素，在促进国际友好合作方面日益发挥重要的作用，在还没有得到民族独立的一些地方，人民正以更加坚定的意志和信念继续进行着争取解放的民族斗争。遭受帝国主义任意摆布和奴役的古老的亚洲，已经是历史的陈迹了。
    在中东和近东，广大人民为了解脱帝国主义的压迫和掠夺，正在进行着英勇的斗争，民族解放的运动正在不断增长。这个地区有些珍爱自己的独立的国家，也正在反对外国把侵略性的军事集团强加在他们头上。大部分仍在殖民统治下的所谓“黑暗大陆”的非洲也已经破晓。在美帝国主义严格控制的拉丁美洲，人民要求自由独立，反对帝国主义奴役的呼声也越来越普遍，使北美的殖民主义感到严重的忧虑。
    历史的发展已是非常清楚，帝国主义能够随心所欲地奴役各国人民的时代已经一去不复返了，殖民主义的锁链正在许多地方碎落，在许多国家里，人民着手按照他们自己的而不是帝国主义的意志来安排他们自己的发展。并且还有更多国家的人民正在奔向同一条道路。没有力量阻挡得住他们。
    正是这一形势的发展，使得帝国主义殖民者不寒而栗，暴跳不安。以美国为首的帝国主义殖民集团，不甘心他们的殖民制度的瓦解。他们拒绝承认世界的变化，极端敌视人民的独立自主运动，而力图保持已经百孔千疮的殖民体系，并且妄想复辟，恢复他们对已获得独立的人民的殖民统治。为了实现这种狂妄的目的，美国向世界各国人民的和平和独立挑衅，到处侵犯他国的主权，干涉他国的内政，建立军事集团和军事基地，制造紧张局势，并准备大规模的战争。美国一方面支持其他殖民国家对殖民地民族解放运动的镇压，同时又无耻地打起“反殖民主义”的幌子，掩护它自己向世界各地扩展它新的殖民统治的活动。美国垄断资本集团正想把所有殖民地都揽为己有，以建立一个庞大的美利坚殖民帝国。那里有民族解放运动，那里就有美国的干涉、镇压以至武装侵略。美国已经成为一切爱好自由人民的最虚伪又是最凶恶的敌人，是日益瓦解的殖民制度的最反动的堡垒。
    在亚洲，美国和它的追随者签订了“东南亚集体防务条约”，要来扼杀日益强大的亚洲民族解放运动，并驱使那些依赖美国的国家，跟着它对中华人民共和国及亚洲其他独立国家进行军事冒险。这是一个彻头彻尾的美国殖民主义者的计划。正如印度尼西亚国民党第一副主席曼贡萨科罗所说：“东南亚公约组织反映着外国殖民者统治东南亚国家的新形式”。二月二十三日美国和其他参加东南亚集团的国家就要在曼谷举行这个帝国主义侵略集团的会议。已经有许多迹象说明，举行这次会议是要加紧推行美国所策划的反对亚洲人民的各种军事、政治和经济侵略，阴谋破坏日内瓦会议的协议，并阻挡亚洲人民争取和平与民族独立斗争的运动。因此，殖民主义者的这场新策划，不能不引起亚洲人民的严重注意。
    必须特别着重指出美国在中国领土台湾地区的侵略活动。这是美帝国主义企图推翻中华人民共和国，恢复美国对中国人民的殖民统治的最露骨的表现。美国死死地抱住早被中国人民唾弃了的蒋介石卖国集团，公然侵占台湾及其他中国岛屿，武装干涉中国内政，进行军事挑衅，以战争威胁来恐吓中国人民，甚至直接参与了蒋介石卖国集团的军事活动。他们还在策划制造“两个中国”或“台湾独立国”的阴谋，企图割裂中国领土，准备新战争。
    中国人民已经在争取民族解放的伟大斗争中，击败了美帝国主义的长期殖民统治，获得了历史性胜利。不容怀疑，我们现在在解放台湾，维护自己的主权和领土完整的斗争中也一定能够取得胜利。谁也扭转不了历史车轮，任何恫吓和欺骗都动摇不了中国人民的解放台湾的坚强决心。
    印度著名和平人士克其鲁说得对，中国人民解放台湾的斗争就是整个世界反对殖民主义、争取自由的斗争。这斗争是必须坚持到底的。否则就会助长殖民主义的凶焰。它将不仅烧着中国人民，也将烧着亚洲其他国家人民。在今天美国到处进行疯狂侵略的情况下，维护民族主权的斗争是和维护和平的斗争密切不可分的。只有坚决反抗帝国主义的侵略，保卫自己的主权，才能保卫和平。正是因为中国人民解放台湾的斗争，也就是保卫亚洲和平和民族独立的斗争，所以它得到亚洲一切爱好和平和自由人民的热烈支持。最近，印度人民所举行的美国
  “撤出台湾日”就表现了亚洲各国人民在维护和平和自由的共同斗争中所建立的团结和友谊。
    今天，一切爱好和平和自由的人民，更怀着兴奋的心情欢迎将召开的亚非会议。亚非人民历史上第一次举行的这样一个自己讨论自己的问题的国际会议，生动地反映了亚洲和非洲所发生的巨大变化。亚洲和非洲的绝大多数人民再不能容忍帝国主义的任意宰割和摆布了。争取和维护独立自由，反对殖民制度，已成为各国人民的普遍愿望。而殖民主义的侵略集团却把这种各国人民的正义的愿望，说成是“共产主义侵略”，而又把他们自己的一切侵略行为，说成是“防止共产主义”，这是欺骗不了任何人的。正如印度尼西亚总理沙斯特罗阿米佐约所指出的：“反殖民主义和反帝国主义并不是共产党人所独占的口号，而是亚洲和非洲广大人民心中的活生生的现实”。亚非会议将提供一个良好的机会，为亚非各国人民反对殖民主义，和平共处和增进友好合作作出贡献。
    殖民时代已经过去了。殖民制度的丧钟早已响了。反对殖民主义、争取民族独立的斗争，是珍爱自己的独立的国家和全体进步人民所支持的正义事业。现在仍处在殖民主义压迫下和遭到帝国主义侵略的各国人民的斗争一定胜利。只要各国人民坚持斗争，并不断地加强和扩大一切爱好和平和自由的人民之间的团结，帝国主义的殖民统治和侵略是一定要被粉碎的。
