Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, February 13th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Zhejiang front liberated Dachen Island, Yushan Islands, Pishan Island, and other islands on February 13th. The Chiang bandit troops on these islands have retreated and fled under the cover of American armed forces. Thus, all enemy-occupied islands along the coast of Zhejiang Province, except for Nanjishan Island on the southernmost sea of Zhejiang, have been completely liberated.

Since last November, the air force, navy, and artillery units of our army on the Zhejiang front have continuously inflicted heavy blows on the Chiang bandit troops entrenched on Dachen Island and its surrounding islands. Our navy and air force sank and destroyed the Chiang bandit's "Taiping" escort destroyer, "Dongting" gunboat, and "Zhong" class landing ship. In particular, after our army, navy, and air force jointly fought and liberated Yijiangshan Island, the vanguard stronghold of the Chiang bandit troops on Dachen Island, the Chiang bandit troops on Dachen Island were increasingly placed in an unfavorable position. Terrified by the might of our army, the Chiang bandit troops on Dachen Island and the surrounding Yushan Islands and Pishan Island had no choice but to abandon the islands and flee. When the Chiang bandit troops on Dachen Island and other islands retreated and fled, the U.S. government ordered its naval and air forces to openly invade the sea near Dachen Island in our country, participate in the command and directly cover the retreat of the Chiang bandit troops on the island, and participate in the criminal acts of the Chiang bandit troops in abducting residents on the island, burning houses on the island, and plundering residents' property.

Dachen Island is located 30 kilometers east of Wenling County, Zhejiang Province, and more than 300 kilometers south of Taiwan. It is the largest stronghold of the Chiang bandits on the coast of Zhejiang. Dachen Island is divided into upper and lower islands, surrounded by small islands such as Sheshan, Shangyu, and Zhuyu, collectively known as the Taizhou Islands, with a total area of approximately 27 square kilometers. For more than five years, with the support of the American aggressive bloc, the Chiang bandit troops have continuously carried out harassment and sabotage activities against the coastal areas of Zhejiang, relying on Dachen Island and the surrounding Yushan Islands, Pishan Island, and other islands. The liberation of these islands has created favorable conditions for our People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan and other coastal islands.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, February 13th: When the Chiang bandit troops fled from Dachen Island, Yushan Islands, and Pishan Island, with the participation of American armed forces, they committed the serious crime of abducting more than 18,000 of all the residents on the islands.

Those who participated in commanding the abduction of residents from Dachen Island and other places included U.S. Seventh Fleet Commander Pride, U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group Chief Chase stationed in Taiwan, and U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Sabin, who had commanded the abduction of North Vietnamese civilians to South Vietnam in Indochina. Chiang bandit Defense Minister Yu Dawei and secret service chief Chiang Ching-kuo also went to Dachen Island one after another to deploy the criminal activities of abducting local residents.

The U.S. Navy and the Chiang bandit troops implemented a genocidal "scorched earth" policy on Dachen Island, Yushan Islands, and Pishan Island, and carried out crazy destruction on every inch of land on the islands. During the period when they abducted residents, hundreds of fires broke out on Dachen Island. The bandits set fire to all the houses, schools, and buildings on the island. The entire island was shrouded in thick smoke, and deafening explosions continued to be heard. For several days in a row, U.S. Navy demolition teams engaged in the bandit activities of arson and blasting from the high mountains to the beaches of Dachen Island. The freshwater ponds on Dachen Island have been destroyed.

From the end of January, large numbers of Chiang bandit troops were dispatched every day to forcibly demolish civilian houses on Dachen Island. They used force to drive the residents outdoors, and then used explosives to collapse the walls of the houses, and dismantled all the wooden materials such as doors and floors, and transported them to the beach to set up floating bridges for boarding ships. The fishing boats on which the fishermen of Dachen Island depended for their livelihoods were also seized by the Chiang bandit troops to set up floating bridges. More than one hundred small fishing boats were seized from the fishermen by the Chiang bandit troops and set on fire. The Chiang bandit troops also looted the shops and residents' property on the island. Food such as chickens, ducks, wine, and cigarettes were all looted. Bulky items in shops and civilian houses that were inconvenient to move were destroyed.

After the Chiang bandit troops and the U.S. Navy demolished, looted, and burned all the houses and property of the residents of Dachen Island, they escorted the residents in batches by village to the beach and transported them to Taiwan. Fully armed U.S. Marines also set up machine guns on the beach to threaten men, women, old and young who were unwilling to leave their homes to board the U.S. transport ships. Many residents were beaten by the Chiang bandit troops for resolutely resisting the Chiang bandit troops' forcing them to leave their homes, and many people were brutally murdered.

    我军解放大陈岛等岛屿
    【新华社浙江前线十三日电】浙江前线的中国人民解放军，在二月十三日解放大陈岛、渔山列岛、披山岛等岛屿。这些岛屿上的蒋贼军已在美国武装力量掩护下撤逃。至此，浙江省沿海敌占岛屿，除浙江最南海面的南麂山岛外，已告全部解放。
    自去年十一月以来，浙江前线我空军、海军和炮兵部队，不断地给予盘踞大陈岛及其外围岛屿上的蒋贼军以沉重的打击。我海军和空军击沉、击毁蒋贼“太平号”护航驱逐舰、“洞庭号”炮舰和中字号登陆舰，特别是最近我陆、海、空军联合作战，一举解放大陈岛蒋贼军的前哨据点一江山岛以后，迫使大陈岛蒋贼军愈来愈处于不利地位。慑于我军的强大威力，大陈岛及其外围的渔山列岛、披山岛上蒋贼军乃不得不弃岛撤逃。在大陈岛等岛屿上的蒋贼军撤逃时，美国政府命令其海空军公然侵入我国大陈岛附近海面，参与指挥和直接掩护岛上蒋贼军撤逃，并参与蒋贼军劫运岛上居民、焚毁岛上房屋、劫夺居民资财的罪恶行为。
    大陈岛位于浙江省温岭县境以东三十公里的海面上，南距台湾约三百余公里，是蒋贼在浙江沿海的最大据点。大陈岛分上、下两岛，四围环布蛇山、上屿、竹屿等小岛，统称台州列岛，面积共约二十七平方公里。五年多来，在美国侵略集团的支持下，蒋贼军依据大陈岛及其外围的渔山列岛、披山岛等岛屿，不断地对浙江沿海地区进行骚扰破坏活动。这些岛屿的解放，造成我人民解放军解放台湾和其它沿海岛屿的有利条件。
    【新华社浙江前线十三日电】蒋贼军从大陈岛、渔山列岛和披山岛逃跑时，在美国武装力量的参与下，制造了劫走岛上全部居民一万八千多人的严重罪行。
    参与指挥劫运大陈岛等地居民的，有美国第七舰队司令普赖德、驻台湾的美国军事援助顾问团团长蔡斯、曾在印度支那指挥把北越平民劫往南越的美国海军少将萨宾等。蒋贼国防部长俞大维和特务头子蒋经国，也曾先后跑到大陈岛部署劫运当地居民的罪恶活动。
    美国海军和蒋贼军在大陈岛、渔山列岛和披山岛上实行了灭绝人性的“焦土”政策，对岛上的每一寸土地都进行了疯狂的破坏。在他们劫运居民的时期内，大陈岛上冒起了几百处火焰。强盗们放火烧毁了岛上所有的民房、学校和建筑物。全岛为浓烟所笼罩，并不断传出震耳的爆炸声。一连几天，美国海军各爆破小组在大陈岛的高山到海滩上从事放火和爆破的盗匪活动。大陈岛的淡水池已被炸毁。
    从一月底起，大陈岛上每天都有大批蒋贼军出动强拆民房。他们用武力把居民赶到室外，接着就用炸药炸塌房屋的墙壁，将所有门板、楼板等木料全部拆下，运到海滩上架设登舰用的浮桥。大陈岛渔民赖以为生的渔船，也被蒋贼军抢去架设浮桥。有一百多条小渔船，被蒋贼军从渔民手中夺过来放火烧毁。蒋贼军还大肆抢劫岛上商店和居民的财物。鸡、鸭、酒、香烟等等食品，都被抢劫一空。店铺、民房中不便搬运的笨重物品，都被破坏。
    蒋贼军和美国海军把大陈岛居民的房舍财物拆光、抢光、烧光之后，就以乡村为单位把居民们成批地押往海滩集中运往台湾。全副武装的美国海军陆战队，也在海滩上架起了机关枪，威胁不愿离开家乡的男女老幼登上美国的运输舰。不少居民因坚决反抗蒋贼军强迫他们离开家乡，遭到了蒋贼军的殴打，有许多人惨遭杀害。
