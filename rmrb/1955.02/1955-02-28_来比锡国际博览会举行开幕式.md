Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, February 27th: The opening ceremony of the 1955 Spring Leipzig International Fair was held on the 26th at the Leipzig National Theatre. The fair is open from February 27th to March 9th.

    Those attending the opening ceremony on the 26th included Chairman of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, Dieckmann; Prime Minister Grotewohl; Deputy Prime Ministers Ulbricht, Nuschke, Stoff, and Hans Heinrich Rau, among others. Distinguished guests attending the opening ceremony included the Soviet government delegation headed by Soviet Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Mikoyan; the Chinese government delegation headed by Chinese Minister of Textile Industry, Jiang Guangnai; government delegations from other countries; diplomatic envoys from various countries, and delegations from thirty-eight countries participating in the Leipzig International Fair.

    The Lord Mayor of Leipzig, Uhlich, welcomed the guests in his address. Deputy Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Hans Heinrich Rau, delivered a speech on behalf of the government, saying that peace-loving people and business circles are watching the imperialist bloc engage in preparations for a new war. He pointed out that the United States is interfering in China's internal affairs and sovereignty in the East, and obstructing German reunification and rearming West Germany in the West, posing a serious threat to peace. Hans Heinrich Rau said that the German Democratic Republic and the countries of the socialist camp are working together to resolve current international disputes peacefully. He emphasized that the fair will help strengthen and expand trade and economic relations between East and West.

    In addition to the German Democratic Republic, the Soviet Union, and the People's Democracies, many Western countries are participating in this year's Leipzig International Fair. This year's fair has aroused greater interest among Western industrialists, including those from West Germany. Despite the Bonn rulers' best efforts to obstruct it, the number of West German companies expressing their intention to participate in the fair has greatly increased compared to last year. According to Schmidt-Wite Mack, Vice President of the Foreign Trade Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, the area occupied by West German companies at the exhibition will be twice as large as last year.

    来比锡国际博览会举行开幕式
    【新华社来比锡二十七日电】一九五五年春季来比锡国际博览会二十六日在来比锡国立大剧院举行开幕仪式。博览会开幕期限是二月二十七日到三月九日。
    参加二十六日开幕仪式的有德意志民主共和国人民议院主席狄克曼、总理格罗提渥、副总理乌布利希、努舍克、斯多夫和汉斯·亨利希·劳等人。参加开幕式的贵宾有以苏联部长会议副主席米高扬为首的苏联政府代表团、以中国纺织工业部长蒋光鼐为首的中国政府代表团、其他国家的政府代表团，各国外交使节和来自三十八个国家的参加来比锡国际博览会的代表团。
    来比锡大市长乌利希向来宾致词表示欢迎。德意志民主共和国副总理汉斯·亨利希·劳代表政府致词，他说，爱好和平的人民和经济界人士注视着帝国主义集团从事新战争的准备。他指出，美国在东方干涉中国内政和主权，在西方阻碍德国统一、重新武装西德，使和平受到严重威胁。汉斯·亨利希·劳说，德意志民主共和国和社会主义阵营各国在一起努力要使目前国际争端用和平方法解决。他强调指出博览会将能有助于加强和扩展东西方的贸易和经济关系。
    参加今年来比锡国际博览会的除德意志民主共和国、苏联和人民民主国家以外，还有许多西方国家。今年的博览会引起了包括西德在内的西方工业界人士的更大的兴趣。尽管波恩统治者竭力阻挠，但是，表示要参加博览会的西德公司的数目，比去年还是大大增加了。据德意志民主共和国对外贸易商会副主席施密特—韦特马克说，西德公司在展览会所占据的场地面积，要比去年大一倍。
