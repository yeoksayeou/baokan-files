    Hu Shi as Depicted by Lu Xun
    Wu Zhongkuang, Jiang Shan
    Since the May Fourth Movement, Lu Xun's ideological position has been in sharp contrast with Hu Shi's. We can see this irreconcilable struggle and the true face of Hu Shi as depicted by Lu Xun in Lu Xun's essays.
                                       ×××
    Even before the May Fourth Movement, when Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi were running "New Youth," Lu Xun had already clearly discerned the depths of Hu Shi's soul. Lu Xun said:
    "New Youth" held an editorial meeting every time an issue was published to decide on the content for the next issue. What caught my attention the most at that time were Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi. If we were to compare strategy to a warehouse, Mr. Duxiu's would have a large flag outside with the words: "Weapons inside, beware!" But the door was open, and there were a few guns and knives inside, clear at a glance, no need to be wary. Mr. Shizhi's would have the door tightly closed, with a small piece of paper stuck on it saying: "No weapons inside, please do not worry." This could naturally be true, but some people—at least people like me—sometimes can't help but tilt their heads and think. [1]
    This very specifically and figuratively points out that hidden behind Hu Shi's deceptive disguise are murderous intentions. Hu Shi initially appeared on the Chinese academic stage wearing such a mask. Under this guise, he "peddled a few fragments back from Dewey and became China's all-denouncing scholar" [2]. For thirty years, he consistently poisoned the people with his reactionary academic ideas, and even now, the Chinese academic community has not been able to completely shake off his influence.
    Just as the tide of the May Fourth Movement swept the country, and revolutionary youth and progressive people, influenced by "New Youth," began to seek new paths, Hu Shi published the idea of ​​"study more problems, talk less about doctrines" in "New Youth," in order to obstruct the spread of Marxism in China. Contrary to his wishes, the spread of Marxism became even more widespread, and the revolutionary color of "New Youth" became increasingly strong. Therefore, Hu Shi requested to change the nature of this magazine. At the end of 1920, Hu Shi put forward three conditions to Li Dazhao, Lu Xun, Chen Duxiu, and Qian Xuantong: first, create another magazine for philosophy and literature; second, issue a declaration stating that they would not talk about politics; and third, stop publishing. In his letter, he said: "Now 'New Youth' has almost become a Chinese translation of Soviet Russia (the name of a Soviet magazine at the time—translator), so I want to start another magazine specifically about academic arts and culture." [3] "If this problem is not resolved first, we will start a new magazine." [4] That is to say, if "New Youth" wanted to insist on its revolutionary stance, he himself would withdraw and start a so-called magazine that "emphasizes the transformation of academics, thoughts, and art, and declares that it will not talk about politics" [5] in order to confront "New Youth".
    Regarding this issue, Li Dazhao adhered to the principle and tried his best to maintain the revolutionary color of "New Youth," letting Hu Shi start his own magazine. Like Li Dazhao, Lu Xun believed:
    I think the current trend of New Youth is toward division. It is not easy to force reconciliation and unification, and whether the first or second method is used, the result is still the same. So it's better to let it split and do it according to the first method. But there is no need to compete for the name "New Youth". [6] Lu Xun had already seen through Hu Shi and believed that rather than reconcile and unify, it was better to simply wash him out. In this way, Hu Shi separated from "New Youth" and started "Endeavor Weekly," which served the reactionary forces.
    The great changes caused by the tide of the May Fourth Movement in Chinese political and ideological life are just as Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The development of the May Fourth Movement has been divided into two trends. One group inherited the spirit of science and democracy of the May Fourth Movement and transformed it on the basis of Marxism, which is what the Communists and some non-Party Marxists have done. The other group went to the road of the bourgeoisie, which is a formalistic and rightward development." [7] Hu Shi, this new-style gentleman fostered by imperialism, is the representative of the right wing. Relying on the reactionary philosophy of pragmatism of the United States, he carried out activities in the Chinese academic community, selling himself to the comprador bourgeoisie. After climbing onto the political stage, he became the most cunning and major enemy of Chinese Marxists in the cultural and ideological front since the "May Fourth". The ultimate goal of his academic activities was to act as an accomplice to the enemies of the Chinese people—imperialism, feudal warlords, and the comprador class.
    And Lu Xun, during this period, began to realize that in the world, there are two different cultural and ideological systems opposing each other. On the one hand, it is the imperialist, that is, the culture of the declining bourgeoisie, and on the other hand, it is Marxism-Leninism, that is, the culture of the emerging proletariat. The former supported the reactionary feudal culture of China, paralyzing the awakening of the Chinese people; the latter armed the minds of the Chinese people and promoted the great battle of national liberation and democratic revolution. Lu Xun clearly stated that this was "the dawn of the new century."
                ×××
    As early as shortly after the May Fourth Movement, Hu Shi put forward the idea of ​​"organizing the national heritage," attempting to drag young students from the fiery struggle into piles of old papers. Later, he chanted loudly, "Discovering the ancient meaning of a word is as great an achievement as discovering a star." In 1923, Hu Shi gave young students a "National Studies Bibliography" with a total of one hundred and eighty-five kinds. He also said that this was the "minimum" "introduction" book. [8] Lu Xun, however, had the opposite view on this issue:
    To organize the national heritage, it is certainly okay to bury oneself under the south window and study dead books. As for the youth, they have their own active knowledge and new art, and it's okay for everyone to do their own thing. But if you take this flag to call on people, that is to isolate China from the world forever. If you think everyone must do this, that is even more absurd! [9]
    Lu Xun not only taught young people to learn "active knowledge" but also exposed Hu Shi's trick of flaunting "erudition":
        I have also used serious efforts, such as what
    "National Studies" and the like, asked a teacher to
    guide me, and paid attention to the reference books
    opened by scholars. The result was not satisfactory. Some
    bibliographies are opened too much, and it takes ten
    years to finish reading them. I even suspect that he himself has not read them; only
    opening a few is better, but this depends on the teacher who opens the bibliography.
    If he is a confused insect, then the few books he
    opens must also be the most confused insects. It's better not to read them, and once you read them, you become
    confused. [10]
    And as the core of Hu Shi's research method, the so-called "bold hypothesis, careful verification" is nothing more than "bold fabrication, tedious comparison" starting from the subjective, and what supports this "comparison" is his unique secret book, that is, the "reliable version and reliable material" that outsiders have no chance to see [11]. Therefore, he started from "Dream of the Red Chamber" "Who is the author of this book, what are the author's deeds and family history, what is the era in which the book was written, what different versions of this book have there been, and what is the origin of these versions," and concluded that "Zhen and Jia Baoyu are the incarnation of Cao Xueqin himself" [12].
    Lu Xun despised this so-called research method. In a letter, he wrote:
        Mr. Zheng's academic research uses Hu Shi's method,
    often relying on unique secret books as a tool to amaze people.
    This is indeed enough to dazzle people, and it should be appreciated by students.
    My method is slightly different. All the books I browse are
    common books and easy to obtain. Therefore, I am alone outside the academic world.
    A Brief History of Chinese Fiction, which is not a dynastic history, has been criticized by people. [13] He also disagreed with arbitrarily "comparing" typical characters in novels through "textual research":
        However, even if someone entirely enters a novel, if the author's
    skill is superb and the work is passed down for a long time, what the reader
    sees is only the character in the book, and it has nothing to do with this person who once existed. For example, the model of Jia Baoyu in Dream of the Red Chamber is the author himself, Cao Zhan, and the model of Mr. Ma Er in The Scholars is Feng Zhizhong. Now what we
    feel is only Jia Baoyu and Mr. Ma Er. Only special scholars like Mr. Hu Shi
    keep Cao Zhan and Feng Zhizhong in mind: this is what is called life is limited,
    but art is more permanent. [14] Thirty years later, today, Hu Shi's ghost still shrouds some people in the academic community. Isn't Yu Pingbo a "Dream of the Red Chamber scholar" who flaunts himself with rare books?
               ×××
    The first domestic revolutionary war failed due to Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the revolution. When Chiang Kai-shek had just occupied Nanjing and declared the Kuomintang's dictatorial government as the only legitimate government, Hu Shi was already preparing in his study a public diary that would express his "inner thoughts" in the future. However, Lu Xun believes that since it is his own diary, why take it out for so many people to see? "Probably influenced by the story of He Zhuo, he was guarding against being 'reviewed by the emperor' one day." However, this kind of thing is always "inevitably pretentious". Not only can't you see the author's heart, "but you always see some pretentiousness, as if you have been deceived." [15] He said:
        I heard that Mr. Hu Shizhi is also keeping a diary later, and it is being passed around for people to see. According to the theory of literary evolution, it must be much better. I hope he will publish it gradually in advance.
          But I think the style of prose can actually be casual, and it doesn't matter if there are flaws. Pretending to write letters and diaries may still have flaws, and once there is a flaw, it will be destroyed beyond repair. Rather than prevent flaws, it is better to forget them. [16]
    With the development of the revolutionary situation, class struggle became increasingly acute, and Chiang Kai-shek began his bloody fascist rule. Hu Shi's reaction was even more blatant reaction. In 1930, in the article "'The Loss-of-Family' and 'The Capitalist Lackey'," written by Lu Xun to criticize Liang Shiqiu, one of the bourgeois cultural agents, he pointed out: "All lackeys, although they may be kept by one capitalist, actually belong to all capitalists, so they are docile to all the rich and bark madly at all the poor. Not knowing who their master is is precisely the reason why they are docile to all the rich, which is also the evidence that they belong to all the capitalists." [17] This law of lackeys also applies to Hu Shi:
        When the "Xuantong Emperor" abdicated to the point of being bored,
      our Dr. Hu Shizhi once fulfilled such a task.
          After meeting him, it was also strange that people didn't know how to ask him what he called them. The doctor said:
          "He calls me Mr., and I call him Emperor."
        ... And in Shanghai, it was heard that "Chiang summoned Hu Shizhi and Ding Wenjiang":
          "Nanjing Special Dispatch: Ding Wenjiang and Hu Shi came to Nanjing to visit Chiang. This visit was made at Chiang's invitation to inquire about the overall situation..."
        Now no one asks him what he calls them.
        Why? Because it is known that this time it is "I call him Chairman...!"...
        No one asked him what he "inquired" about either.
        Why? Because this is also known, it is the "overall situation". And this "overall situation" does not have the trouble of the "Kuomintang dictatorship" and "British-style freedom" controversy, nor does it have the trouble of the "knowing is difficult and doing is easy" and "knowing is easy and doing is difficult" controversy, so the doctor came out. [18] This is precisely the evidence that Hu Shi belongs to all reactionary ruling class masters. Since Hu Shi openly sold himself to the ruling class, he has consistently engaged in anti-people and counter-revolutionary activities, flattering the reactionary regime on the one hand and currying favor with imperialism on the other. Hu Shi's experimentalism advocated "bit-by-bit reform" and opposed the fundamental solution of social problems, that is, opposed overthrowing the existing system. Therefore, he advocated compromising reformism in politics, advocating that "good people" and "talents" in the imagination of the bourgeoisie should organize the so-called "good people government" and "first-class talent cabinet," attempting to carry out bit-by-bit "reform" of the bourgeoisie under the rule of imperialism and feudal warlords, and opposing revolution. Hu Shi, who "talks more about problems and less about doctrines" and teaches people not to be "led by the nose by Marx, Lenin, and Stalin," is naturally the "good person" most favored by the reactionary ruling class and the "talent" that must be recruited. ×××
    In 1932, the Lytton Commission came to China. At the end of the year, Ms. Soong Ching Ling, on behalf of the China League for Civil Rights, published an article on the issue of "striving for the release of domestic political prisoners and opposing the currently prevalent system of imprisonment, torture, and execution," appealing to society. At this time, Hu Shi, who had been expelled from the League for his betrayal, was busy "investigating" several prisons in Beijing and published a conversation with the foreign-run "North China Daily News". The Beijing correspondence of the "North China Daily News" reported:
        According to his careful investigation, he could not find the slightest evidence... They could easily talk to the prisoners. Once Dr. Hu Shi was able to talk to them in English. The condition of the prison, he said, was not satisfactory, but although they freely complained about the bad treatment and insults, they did not even hint at torture.
      "Freedom," "no torture," what a civilized impression! This is heaven, where is it still a prison under Chiang Kai-shek's rule. Lu Xun ridiculed: "Could it be that Chinese prisons have been improved to this point, and are so 'free'; or did the jailer get scared by the 'English language' and thought that Dr. Hu Shi was a fellow townsman of Sir Lytton and had a great origin?" [19]
    It turned out that the China League for Civil Rights had exposed Chiang's family scandal. What an indecent thing it must be for Chiang Kai-shek standing in front of foreigners. In order to defend his master, Hu Shi made this "careful investigation." Although the prison is dark, in the eyes of a loyal servant who is "loyal to the country," there is a "bright" scene. And for Hu Shi, who bears "heavy responsibilities," how can the prison not open "special cases"? Therefore, Lu Xun said:
        Fortunately, this time I saw Dr. Hu Shi's inscription on the "Three Major Cases of China Merchants Bureau":
          "Publicly exposing corruption is the only weapon to overthrow dark politics. Where there is light, darkness will disappear."
        I suddenly realized. It is not allowed to talk to prisoners in foreign languages ​​in prison, but as soon as Dr. Hu Shi arrives, a special case is opened because he can "publicly expose corruption", he can talk to foreigners "very lovingly", he is "light", so "where there is light, darkness will disappear". He then "publicly exposed" the China League for Civil Rights to foreigners, and "darkness" fell on this side. [20]
    Just as the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group's military "encirclement and suppression" was frantically carried out in the Soviet area and white terror enveloped the country, Hu Shi, wearing the cloak of a "scholar," was carrying out cultural "encirclement and suppression" for the reactionaries in a hurry. Hu Shi and Chiang Kai-shek, one civilian and one military, intensified their criminal activities against the people. Chiang Kai-shek said, "To resist foreign aggression, we must first pacify the internal," and Hu Shi said that "political prisoners should be suppressed." At the beginning of 1933, Hu Shi went to Changsha to give a lecture, and the reactionary He Jian therefore sent him a thank-you gift of five thousand silver dollars. Lu Xun ridiculed: "The price is not small, this 'is called' experimentalism" [21]. But what did he say? The "North China Daily News" recorded Hu Shi's words like this:
        Any government should have the right to protect itself and suppress movements that harm it. Of course, political prisoners, like other criminals, should receive legal protection and a fair trial...
    Regarding this passage, Lu Xun broke through in one sentence:
        This is much clearer! Isn't this talking about "government power"? Of course, the doctor's mind is not simple. He won't just say: "One hand holds a sword, and the other hand holds the classics!" such as what doctrine and so on. He said that he should also hold the law.
        Poem: Cultural class leader, doctorate, human rights are abandoned and royal power is said, the court has always had many massacres, this reason is now transmitted by experiment. Human rights and royal way are both renewed, thanking you for your kindness and playing Shengming, it doesn't matter to abuse the government, killing people like grass doesn't hear a sound. [22]
    This is Lu Xun's extremely concise and extremely profound criticism of Hu Shi's experimentalism and political activities.
    At that time, Hu Shi was talking a lot about his "theory of human rights." What was the content of the so-called "theory of human rights"? Lu Xun's sentence "Isn't this talking about 'government power'?" is a penetrating revelation. The so-called "theory of human rights" is, in fact, "a method designed for those who govern the people, that is, those in power, and there is nothing for the people themselves" [23]. This is precisely to cater to the reactionary ruling class, so Hu Shi jumped and became "the saint of those in power" [24].
    Hu Shi, who shamelessly and willingly served as a dog of the feudal forces of imperialism, played a trick of "five ghosts making trouble in China" as early as before the September 18th Incident. After the September 18th Incident, Hu Shi again advocated for the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group's policy of non-resistance, "discovering the sixth ghost, called hatred. This ghost not only makes trouble in China, but also brings disaster to friendly countries, making trouble in Tokyo... According to the doctor: 'The hatred caused by the atrocities of Japanese warlords in China has been quite difficult to eliminate today,' 'and Japan can never conquer China by force'... This is worth worrying about: is there really no way to conquer China? No, there is a way. 'The enmity of nine generations and the friendship of a hundred years are all on the head of the relationship between awakening and not awakening,'——'Japan has only one way to conquer China, that is to rein in the precipice, completely stop the invasion of China, and in turn conquer the hearts of the Chinese people.'" [25] Hu Shi openly became the spokesperson of American and Japanese imperialism and the reactionary comprador class. Mr. Lu Xun gave an angry rebuttal in the article "The Secret of Selling Souls":
        This is said to be "the only way to conquer China." That's right, the
    ancient Confucian military advisors always said, "Those who subdue people with virtue will reign, and their hearts will be sincerely convinced." Dr. Hu Shi is worthy of being a Japanese imperialist
    military advisor. However, from the perspective of ordinary Chinese people, this is
    the only secret to selling souls. Ordinary Chinese people are really "ignorant" and originally do not understand their "national character," so they
    have always hated. If His Majesty the Emperor of Japan shows great mercy and actually adopts
    Dr. Hu's memorial, then the so-called "loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, harmony, and peace" of Chinese inherent culture can be restored; because Japan does not use violence but uses the soft power of royal way, the Chinese nation will
    not have hatred again. Because there is no hatred, there will naturally be no more resistance, because there is no more resistance, there will naturally be more peace, more loyalty and filial piety
    ... China's body has been bought, and China's soul has also been conquered.
        Unfortunately, the implementation of this "only method" completely depends on the awakening of His Majesty the Emperor of Japan. If he does not wake up, then what
    to do? Dr. Hu replied: "When it is helpless, it is better to really accept a humiliating alliance under the city." That is really helpless—because at that time the "hatred ghost" is unwilling to go, this is always a stain on the Chinese national character, and even for Japan, it is not a foolproof way.
        Therefore, Dr. Hu is preparing to attend the Pacific Conference and go
    to "advise" his Japanese friends one more time: it is not that there is no way to conquer China, please accept the soul we sell, and it is not difficult, the so-called "complete cessation of aggression" only needs to implement the "fair" Lytton Report—hatred will naturally be eliminated! Hu Shi's "strategic offensive of the mind" was bluntly pointed out by Lu Xun as "the secret of selling souls". What Hu Shi and the like longed for was that the invaders would use true "royal way" to replace "hegemony" in order to consolidate their position as slaves. But the reactionary traitorous group did not know: "The royal way in China," as Lu Xun said, "although it seems to be opposed to hegemony, it is actually a brother. Before and after this, there must be hegemony coming." [26] From the perspective of the slaves, when the invaders implement the "royal way," it is the "era when they can temporarily stabilize their position as slaves," and when the "hegemony comes," it is the "era when they want to be slaves but cannot." [27] However, Lu Xun pointed out that the "era when Hu Shi and others want to stabilize their position as slaves" will never come again, because "ordinary Chinese people... have always hated" [28], which makes the "royal way" that the slaves longed for to "conquer the hearts of the Chinese people" fail, and "the stubborn people are made baseless" [29]. Lu Xun also firmly asserted that the heart of the Chinese nation will definitely not be conquered. No matter how hard the "royal way" advocates work, the Chinese people are no longer in the era of the Yuan and Qing dynasties, and they will not be fooled by the "royal way."
                       ×××
    Lu Xun's criticism and brave impact on Hu Shi's reactionary thoughts and counter-revolutionary activities can be found everywhere in his essays. This article only puts forward some of Lu Xun's comments on several aspects to show Lu Xun's lifelong struggle to the death with all reactionary thoughts and the great contribution he made on the ideological front led by the Chinese Communist Party. After the national liberation, our academic and literary circles have not completely eliminated Hu Shi's reactionary bourgeois idealist viewpoint. We should take Lu Xun's fighting life as a brilliant example, learn Lu Xun's spirit of uncompromising and unforgiving to the enemy, to destroy the enemy's last position, and further consolidate and expand the great victory of Marxism-Leninism in all aspects of political, cultural, academic thought in the new China.

专栏：

    鲁迅笔下的胡适
    吴忠匡　江山
    五四运动以来鲁迅的思想立场始终和胡适的思想立场对立得非常鲜明，我们从鲁迅的杂文中，就能够看到这种不调和的斗争，看到鲁迅笔下的胡适的真实的嘴脸。
                                       ×××
    远在五四运动以前，陈独秀、胡适办“新青年”的时期，鲁迅对胡适早就清楚地洞察到他灵魂的深处。鲁迅说：
    新青年每出一期，就开一次编辑会，商定下一期的稿件。其时最惹我注意的是陈独秀和胡适之。假如将韬略比作一间仓库罢，独秀先生的是外面竖一面大旗，大书道：“内皆武器，来者小心！”但那门却开着的，里面有几枝枪，几把刀，一目了然，用不着提防。适之先生的是紧紧的关着门，门上粘一条小纸条道：“内无武器，请勿疑虑。”这自然可以是真 的，但有些人——至少是我这样的人——有时总不免要侧着头想一想。〔一〕
    这就极为具体而形象地指出了胡适诡骗的掩饰后面隐藏着凶器。胡适一开始就是戴着这样一副面具出现在中国学术舞台上的。在这种伪装下，从杜威那里“零零碎碎贩运一点回来的就变了中国的诃斥八极的学者”〔二〕，三十年来以他的反动学术思想，一贯毒害着人民，一直到现在，中国学术界还不能完全摆脱开他的影响。
    正当五四运动的浪潮席卷全国，革命青年和进步人民在“新青年”的影响下开始寻求新的出路的时候，胡适却在“新青年”发表了“多研究些问题，少谈些主义”的主张，来阻挠马克思主义在中国的传播。谁知事与愿违，马克思主义的传播，更加广泛起来了，“新青年”的革命色彩也愈来愈浓厚。于是胡适就要求改变这个杂志的性质。一九二○年年底，胡适向李大钊、鲁迅、陈独秀和钱玄同等提出三个条件：第一、另创一个哲学文学的杂志；第二、发表宣言，声明不谈政治；第三、停办。他在信里说：“今新青年差不多成了Soviet Russia（“苏俄”，是当时的一种苏联杂志的名称——引者）的汉译本，故我想另创办一个专关学术艺文的杂志。”〔三〕“若此问题不先解决，我们便办起新杂志来了。”〔四〕这就是说，“新青年”如果要坚持革命主张，他自己就要退出，另办一个所谓“注重学术、思想、艺术的改造，声明不谈政治”〔五〕的杂志，以便和“新青年”对抗。
    对于这个问题，李大钊坚持了原则，极力维护革命色彩显明的“新青年”，让胡适自己另办自己的杂志去。鲁迅和李大钊一样，他认为：
    我看现在新青年的趋势是倾于分裂的。不容易勉强调和统一，无论用第一、第二条办法，结果还是一样。所以索性任他分裂，照第一条做，或者倒还好一点。但不必争“新青年”这个名目。〔六〕鲁迅已经看透了胡适这个人，认为与其调和统一，就不如干脆把他清洗出去。这样，胡适就和“新青年”分了家，另办了为反动势力服务的“努力周报”。
    五四运动的浪潮，在中国政治、思想生活中所引起的巨大激变，正如毛泽东同志所说：“五四运动的发展，分成了两个潮流。一部分人继承了五四运动的科学和民主的精神，并在马克思主义的基础上加以改造，这就是共产党人和若干党外马克思主义者所做的工作。另一部分人则走到资产阶级的道路上去，是形式主义向右的发展。”〔七〕胡适这个在帝国主义豢养下的新式绅士，就是右翼的代表，倚靠着美国的反动哲学实用主义在中国学术界进行活动，向买办资产阶级卖身投靠，爬上政治舞台以后，成了“五四”以来中国马克思主义者在文化思想战线上最狡黠最主要的敌人。他的学术活动的终极目的，就是在替中国人民的敌人——帝国主义、封建军阀、买办阶级起帮凶的作用。
    而鲁迅，在这时期，开始认识到了：在世界上，对立着两种不同的文化思想体系，一方面是帝国主义的即没落的资产阶级的文化，另一方面是马克思列宁主义即新兴的无产阶级的文化。前者支持了中国反动的封建文化，麻痹了中国人民大众的觉醒；后者武装了中国人民的头脑，推进了民族解放与民主革命的伟大战斗。鲁迅明确提出这是“新世纪的曙光”。
                ×××
    早在五四运动后不久，胡适就提出“整理国故”的主张，企图把青年学生从火热的斗争拖进故纸堆中去。以后他又高唱着“发明一个字的古义，与发现一颗恒星，都是一大功绩”。一九二三年，胡适给青年学生开出一个“国学书目”，共有一百八十五种。他还说这是“最低限度”的“入门”书。〔八〕鲁迅对于这一问题却有相反的看法：
    要整理国故，当然不妨去埋在南窗下读死书，至于青年，却自有他们的活学问和新艺术，各干各事，也还没有大妨害的，但若拿了这面旗子来号召，那就是要中国永远与世界隔绝了。倘以为大家非此不可，那更是荒谬绝伦！〔九〕
    鲁迅不但教导青年人要学“活学问”，同时，更拆穿了胡适这种卖弄“博学”的骗术：
        我也曾用过正经工夫，如什么“国学”之
    类，请过先生指教，留心过学者所开的参考书
    目。结果都不满意。有些书目开得太多，要十
    来年才能看完，我还疑心他自己就没有看；只
    开几部的较好，可是这须看这位开书目的先生
    了，如果他是一位胡涂虫，那么，开出来的几
    部一定也是极顶胡涂虫，不看还好，一看就胡
    涂。〔十〕
    而作为胡适的治学方法的中心，即所谓“大胆的假设，小心的求证”，不过是从主观出发的“大胆的捏造，繁琐的比附”而已，而支持这种“比附”的就是他的孤本秘笈，即外人无缘得见的“可靠的版本与可靠的材料”〔十一〕。因此，他从“红楼梦”“这书的著者究竟是谁，著者的事迹家世，著书的时代，这书曾有何种不同的本子，这些本子的来历如何”入手，考出“甄贾两宝玉即是曹雪芹自己的化身”〔十二〕。
    对于这种所谓治学方法，鲁迅是鄙弃的，他在一封信里这样写道：
        郑君治学，盖用胡适之法，往往恃孤本秘
    笈，为惊人之具，此实足以炫耀人目，其为学子
    所珍赏，宜也。我法稍有不同，凡所泛览，皆通
    行之本，易得之书，故遂孑然于学林之外，中
    国小说史略而非断代，即尝见贬于人。〔十三〕他更不同意把小说中的典型人物以“考据”去任意“比附”：
        然而纵使谁整个的进了小说，如果作者手
    腕高妙，作品久传的话，读者所见的就只是书中
    人，和这曾经实有的人倒不相干了。例如红楼
    梦里贾宝玉的模特儿是作者自己曹霑，儒林外
    史里马二先生的模特儿是冯执中，现在我们所
    觉得的却只是贾宝玉和马二先生，只有特种学
    者如胡适之先生之流，这才把曹霑和冯执中念
    念不忘的记在心儿里：这就是所谓人生有限，
    而艺术却较为永久的话罢。〔十四〕事隔三十年，在今天，胡适的阴魂也还笼罩着部分学术界的人士，俞平伯不就是一个恃珍本而自炫的“红学家”吗？
               ×××
    第一次国内革命战争由于蒋介石的叛变革命而失败了。在蒋介石刚刚盘据南京，宣布国民党独裁政府为唯一合法政府的时候，胡适早就在自己的书房里准备着将来表述“心迹”的公开日记了。但是，鲁迅认为，既然是自己的日记，又为什么要拿出来给许多人看呢？“大概是受了何焯的故事的影响的，他提防有一天要蒙‘御览’”。不过，这种东西总“不免有些装腔”，不但看不见作者的心，“却时时看到一些做作，仿佛受了欺骗。”〔十五〕他说：
        听说后来胡适之先生也在做日记，并且给
    人传观了。照文学进化的理论讲起来，一定该
    好得多。我希望他提前陆续的印出。
          但我想，散文的体裁，其实是大可以随便
    的，有破绽也不妨。做作的写信和日记，恐怕
    也还不免有破绽，而一有破绽，便破灭到不可
    收拾了。与其防破绽，不如忘破绽。〔十六〕
    随着革命形势的发展，阶级斗争日益尖锐，蒋介石开始了血腥的法西斯统治，胡适所表现的是更为露骨的反动。一九三○年，鲁迅在为批判资产阶级文化代理人之一梁实秋而写的“‘丧家的’‘资本家的乏走狗’”一文中，曾指出：“凡走狗，虽或为一个资本家所豢养，其实是属于所有的资本家的，所以它遇见所有的阔人都驯良，遇见所有的穷人都狂吠。不知道谁是它的主子，正是它遇见所有阔人都驯良的原因，也就是属于所有的资本家的证据。”〔十七〕这一条走狗定律，同样适用于胡适：
        当“宣统皇帝”逊位逊到坐得无聊的时候，
      我们的胡适之博士曾经尽过这样的任务。
          见过以后，也奇怪，人们不知怎的先问他
    们怎样的称呼，博士曰：
          “他叫我先生，我叫他皇上。”
        ……而在上海，又以“蒋召见胡适之、丁
    文江”闻：
          “南京专电：丁文江、胡适，来京谒蒋，
      此来系奉蒋召，对大局有所垂询。……”
        现在没有人问他怎样的称呼。
        为什么呢？因为是知道的，这回是“我称
    他主席……！”……
        也没有人问他“垂询”些什么。
        为什么呢？因为这也是知道的，是“大
      局”。而且这“大局”也并无“国民党专政”
    和“英国式自由”的争论的麻烦，也没有“知
    难行易”和“知易行难”的争论的麻烦，所
    以，博士就出来了。〔十八〕这正是胡适属于所有反动统治阶级主子的证据。胡适自从公开的卖身投靠于统治阶级以后，一贯地进行反人民反革命的活动，他一面向反动政权献媚，一面向帝国主义讨好。胡适的实验主义就曾主张“一点一滴的改良”，而反对社会问题的根本解决，即是反对推翻现存的制度。因此，他在政治上鼓吹妥协的改良主义，主张由资产阶级意想中的“好人”、
  “人才”来组织所谓“好人政府”、“第一流人才内阁”，企图在帝国主义与封建军阀的统治下，进行资产阶级的一点一滴的“改良”，反对革命。“多谈些问题，少谈些主义”、教人不给“马克思列宁斯大林牵着鼻子走”的胡适自然是反动统治阶级最中意的“好人”，必须罗致的“人才”了。×××
    一九三二年，李顿调查团来中国。年底宋庆龄先生代表中国民权保障同盟就“争取释放国内政治犯，反对目前到处盛行的监禁、酷刑和处决的制度”问题发表文章，向社会呼吁。这时，因叛卖行为被该同盟清除出去的胡适又忙匆匆地在北京“调查”了几个监狱，并向外国人办的“字林西报”发表了谈话。“字林西报”的北京通讯报道说：
        据他的慎重调查，实在不能得最轻微的证
    据，……他们很容易和犯人谈话，有一次胡适
    博士还能够用英国话和他们会谈。监狱的情形，
    他说，是不能满意的，但是，虽然他们很自由
    的诉说待遇的恶劣侮辱，然而关于严刑拷打，
    他们却连一点儿暗示也没有。
      “自由”，“没有严刑拷打”，这是多么文明的印象！这是天堂了，那里还是蒋介石统治下的监狱。鲁迅嘲笑说：“莫非中国的监狱竟已经改良到这地步，‘自由’到这地步；还是狱卒给‘英国话’吓倒了，以为胡适博士是李顿爵士的同乡，很有来历的缘故呢？”〔十九〕
    原来，民权保障同盟把蒋家的家丑外扬了，对于站在洋大人面前的蒋介石该是多么不体面的事，胡适为了给他的主子辩白一番，才特地作出这次“慎重调查”。监狱虽黑暗，但在“为主江山”的忠实奴才看来，却别有一番“光明”景象。而对于负有“重任”的胡适，监狱又怎能不开“特例”。因此鲁迅说：
        幸而我这回看见了“招商局三大案”上的
    胡适博士的题辞：
          “公开检举，是打倒黑暗政治的唯一武
    器，光明所到，黑暗自消。”
        我于是大彻大悟。监狱里是不准用外国话
    和犯人会谈的，但胡适博士一到，就开了特例，
    因为他能够“公开检举”，他能够和外国人“很
    亲爱的”谈话，他就是“光明”，所以“光
    明”所到，“黑暗”就“自消”了。他于是向
    外国人“公开检举”了民权保障同盟，“黑
    暗”倒在这一面。〔二十〕
    正当蒋介石反动集团的军事“围剿”在苏区疯狂进行、白色恐怖笼罩全国的时候，胡适却披着
  “学者”的外衣，风尘仆仆地为反动派进行着文化
  “围剿”。胡适和蒋贼，一文一武加紧反人民的罪恶活动，蒋介石说“攘外必先安内”，胡适就说应该“镇压政治罪犯”。一九三三年初，胡适往长沙讲演一次，反动派何键因此送了他五千块大洋的谢礼，鲁迅嘲笑说：“价钱不算小，这‘叫做’实验主义”〔二十一〕。但是，讲了些什么呢？“字林西报”这样记载了胡适的话：
        任何一个政府都应当有保护自己而镇压那
    些危害自己的运动的权利，固然，政治犯也和
    其他罪犯一样，应当得着法律的保障和合法的
    审判……
    对于这一段谈话，鲁迅却一语道破：
        这就清楚得多了！这不是在说“政府权”
    了么？自然，博士的头脑并不简单，他不至于
    只说：“一只手拿着宝剑，一只手拿着经典！”
    如什么主义之类。他是说还应当拿着法律。
        诗曰：文化班头博士衔，人权抛却说王
    权，朝廷自古多屠戮，此理今凭实验传。人权
    王道两翻新，为感君恩奏圣明，虐政何妨援律
    例，杀人如草不闻声。〔二十二〕
    这是鲁迅对胡适的实验主义和政治活动的极概括而又极深刻的批判。
    那时候，胡适正大讲其“人权论”，所谓“人权论”的内容是什么呢？鲁迅那一句“这不是在说‘政府权’了么？”便是一针见血的剥露。所谓“人权论”者，事实上“都是为了治民众者，即权势者设想的方法，为民众本身的，却一点也没有”〔二十三〕。这正是投反动统治阶级所好的，于是胡适一跃而成为“权势者们的圣人”〔二十四〕。
    厚颜无耻甘心充当封建势力帝国主义走狗的胡适，早在九一八事变前就玩过一套“五鬼闹中华”的把戏。到九一八以后，胡适又替蒋介石反动集团的不抵抗政策张目，“发现了第六个鬼，叫做仇恨。这个鬼不但闹中华，而且祸延友邦，闹到东京去了。……据博士说：‘日本军阀在中国暴行所造成之仇恨，到今日已颇难消除，’‘而日本决不能用暴力征服中国’……这是值得忧虑的：难道真的没有方法征服中国么？不，法子是有的。‘九世之仇，百年之友，均在觉悟不觉悟之关系头上，’——‘日本只有一个方法可以征服中国，即悬崖勒马，彻底停止侵略中国，反过来征服中国民族的心。’”〔二十五〕胡适公开成了美、日帝国主义和反动买办阶级的代言人。鲁迅先生在“出卖灵魂的秘诀”一文中给以愤怒的驳斥：
        这据说是“征服中国的唯一方法。”不错，
    古代的儒教军师，总说“以德服人者王，其心
    诚服也。”胡适博士不愧为日本帝国主义的
    军师。但是，从中国小百姓方面说来，这却
    是出卖灵魂的唯一秘诀。中国小百姓实在“愚
    昧”，原不懂得自己的“民族性”，所以他们
    一向会仇恨，如果日本陛下大发慈悲，居然采
    用胡博士的条陈，那么，所谓“忠孝仁爱信义
    和平”的中国固有文化，就可以恢复；——因
    为日本不用暴力而用软功的王道，中国民族就
    不至于再生仇恨，因为没有仇恨，自然更不抵
    抗，因为更不抵抗，自然就更和平，更忠孝
    ……中国的肉体固然买到了，中国的灵魂也被
    征服了。
        可惜的是这“唯一方法”的实行，完全要
    靠日本陛下的觉悟。如果不觉悟，那又怎么
    办？胡博士回答道：“到无可奈何之时，真的
    接受一种耻辱的城下之盟”好了。那真是无可
    奈何的呵——因为那时候“仇恨鬼”是不肯走
    的，这始终是中国民族性的污点，即为日本
    计，也非万全之道。
        因此，胡博士准备出席太平洋会议，再去
    “忠告”一次他的日本朋友：征服中国并不是
    没有法子的，请接受我们出卖的灵魂罢，何况
    这并不难，所谓“彻底停止侵略”，原只要执
    行“公平的”李顿报告——仇恨自然就消除
      了！胡适这种“攻心为上”的战略，被鲁迅直白地指为是“出卖灵魂的秘诀”。胡适之类所渴望的，是侵略者用真正的“王道”来代替“霸道”，以稳固自己奴才的地位。但反动的卖国集团不知道：“在中国的王道”，正如鲁迅所说的，“看去虽然好像是和霸道对立的东西，其实却是兄弟，这之前和之后，一定要有霸道跑来的。”〔二十六〕从奴才们的立场看来，在侵略者实行“王道”的时候，是他们可以
  “暂时做稳了奴隶的时代”，而当“霸道跑来”的时候，则是“想做奴隶而不得的时代”。〔二十七〕然而，鲁迅指出：胡适他们想“做稳了奴隶的时代”是不会再来的了，因为“中国小百姓……一向会仇恨”〔二十八〕，这就使奴才们所渴望的“征服中国民族的心”的“王道”落了空，给“顽民”
  “弄得毫无根据了”〔二十九〕。鲁迅并确切断言：中国民族的心是断然征服不了的，任凭“王道”宣扬者如何卖力，可是，中国人民已经不是处在元、清之际，他们不会被“王道”所愚弄了。
                       ×××
    鲁迅对胡适的反动思想及其反革命活动的批判与勇猛的冲击，在他的杂文中是随处都可以遇见的，本文只就几个方面提出鲁迅的一些评论，以见鲁迅毕生与一切反动思想进行决死的斗争，在中国共产党所领导的思想战线上所作出的巨大贡献。全国解放以后，在我们学术文艺界还没有完全清除胡适反动的资产阶级唯心论观点，我们应当以鲁迅战斗的一生，作为光辉榜样，学习鲁迅对敌人毫不妥协毫不容情的精神，来摧毁敌人的最后一块阵地，进一步巩固和扩大马克思列宁主义在新中国政治和文化学术思想各方面的伟大胜利。
