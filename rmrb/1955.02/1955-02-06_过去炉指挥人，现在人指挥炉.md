    In the Past, the Furnace Commanded People, Now People Command the Furnace
    By Our Reporter Pei Lan
    All the workers of the No. 1 Blast Furnace in the Iron Smelting Department of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant comprehensively overfulfilled the state production plan for 1954, creating a wealth of 4.69 billion yuan for the country. They increased the production of pig iron by 15,671 tons (including 12,000 tons produced by postponing major repairs). According to the national plan, the quality of pig iron was required to reach 99 percent, but it actually reached 99.55 percent; production costs were reduced by 4.7 billion yuan; labor efficiency was increased by 2.75 percent; and no major industrial or personal accidents occurred throughout the year. Because of these many achievements, No. 1 Blast Furnace was rated as a model work section in Beijing. They selected shift foreman Wang Cai to attend the Beijing Municipal Industrial Labor Model Conference.
    No. 1 Blast Furnace is an old furnace, so why was it able to overfulfill its production tasks? This is because all the workers of No. 1 Blast Furnace, in promoting Soviet advanced experience, learned and mastered advanced scientific knowledge and improved their technical level. In the workers' own words: In the past, the furnace commanded people, but now people command the furnace.
    In the past, the workers of No. 1 Blast Furnace could not control the furnace, and the furnace frequently experienced incidents of material collapse and suspension. When accidents occurred, they could not be dealt with in a timely manner. At that time, the workers were fatalistic: when the furnace ran well, they could operate freely; when the furnace had problems, they were at a loss. The output of the blast furnace fluctuated greatly and was extremely abnormal.
    In order to reverse this situation, all the workers of No. 1 Blast Furnace conscientiously promoted important advanced Soviet experiences such as "ore classification into the furnace," "blast furnace top regulation," and "blast furnace steam blowing" [Note] in 1954.
    Before promoting advanced experiences, the shift foreman and all workers of No. 1 Blast Furnace first studied the technical theory of advanced experience and specific methods of promotion. In order to enable workers to systematically learn and master the technical theory of blast furnaces, the Iron Smelting Department also held technical training courses for shift foremen, with engineers and shift directors of the Iron Smelting Department taking turns lecturing.
    Learning the basic theory of smelting was a very urgent and difficult task for the blast furnace shift foremen. Because the vast majority of shift foremen were promoted from workers, some had never been to school at all, and some had studied for a year or two and slowly forgotten everything. After liberation, they participated in cultural classes to learn culture. Now they can read newspapers, but they have difficulty listening to lectures. Each time they listened to a lecture, they relied on their brains to memorize, and could only remember about half. If they took notes, they could not even remember one-third. Later, they made the greatest determination to study hard and memorize. Wang Cai, the shift foreman of No. 1 Blast Furnace, bought many books and became obsessed with them. During the day, when he returned home, he asked his wife to take the children out to play, and he stayed at home to read. He came home from work at twelve o'clock at night, and after eating, it was already past one o'clock, and he still had to read. Sometimes he was too sleepy, and he fell asleep after reading for a while. His wife quietly took the book away and covered him with a quilt, but this woke him up, and he found the book and continued reading. Sometimes his wife was so angry that she turned off the light, and after she fell asleep, he turned on the light and continued reading. Other foremen were the same as Wang Cai, and they seemed to be engaged in a secret competition, all desperately studying. Shift foreman Song Yulin was already thirty-seven or eight years old. He said: "My memory is not as good as Wang Cai's, so I read and write at the same time. Writing it myself is more memorable than reading it once." He wrote all the scientific basis and calculation formulas in his notebook.
    They started studying in January and continued until November, and their results were very good. In the past, when the furnace had problems, they would just reduce the wind and reduce the amount of iron melted in the furnace, regardless of the consequences. Now, when the furnace has problems, they can study what the problem is and what method to use to deal with it. Learning gave them a key.
    Through learning, they gradually mastered scientific knowledge. No. 1 Blast Furnace also added some necessary instruments, ensuring the smooth implementation of the above three major advanced experiences. In the first half of last year, the furnace condition was very good. Starting from the second half of the year, due to the age of the furnace, operational difficulties occurred, and output decreased. However, because the technical level of the shift foremen had improved, they could also handle this situation well. Moreover, after gradually exploring, they found the operating rules, which ensured the smooth operation of the furnace and increased output.
    No. 1 Blast Furnace is indeed very old, and the furnace wall on the west side is already very thin. Because they did a good job of maintenance, the life of the blast furnace was extended.
    The quality of blast furnace maintenance depends on how well the water watching team does its maintenance and inspection work on the cooling system. The water watching team of No. 1 Blast Furnace has not had an accident for a thousand days. They formulated a detailed inspection system in 1953. Because of its good implementation, they were rated as an advanced team in the workshop that year. This team has a total of seven people, all young men, who are very enthusiastic, energetic, and quick to learn advanced experience. But they used to have a shortcoming: they were enthusiastic for a while, and then it was over. The work of the workers in the water watching team is very hard. They always get wet when they inspect the furnace. Therefore, they wear very thick canvas work clothes all year round, and they have to wear two layers. In summer, they wear canvas clothes, sweat inside, and water outside; in winter, they wear canvas clothes, ice outside, and melt inside. Because of this, some workers do not follow the system for inspection. There are only two people on each shift, and sometimes the two people discuss not inspecting. Since last year, everyone has changed, realizing that strengthening the maintenance of the cooling system is of great significance for extending the life of the blast furnace. They established a responsibility system and a patrol inspection system, and everyone inspected the past problems of being hot and cold and lacking a conscientious and responsible spirit, so their sense of responsibility was strengthened. In the past, each shift only inspected the furnace door, furnace belly, and furnace wall water tank once, but now it has been increased to eight times for the furnace door and twice for the furnace belly and furnace wall. Regardless of the hot summer or the cold winter, they climb up the blast furnace to measure the furnace temperature and inspect the water tank day and night. They are often熏 by the furnace until their faces hurt, and浇 by the water until they are soaked all over, but they have never interrupted it once. Last year, No. 1 Blast Furnace stopped ventilation for maintenance more than a dozen times, and not once was it affected for even a minute due to the poor work of the water watching team.
    The workers of the water watching team not only strengthened the inspection work, but also studied and improved some equipment. The furnace wall on the west side of the blast furnace is thin, and the water tank inside the furnace is quickly burned out. They suggested adding a water spray pipe outside the furnace to strengthen the cooling equipment, maintain the blast furnace, and keep the blast furnace running normally.
    The blast furnace shift foremen and the workers of the hot blast stove team also actively studied and strengthened the maintenance work of the blast furnace. With the help of shift director Xie Maochun, they studied and developed a method to improve the tuyere. They reduced the diameter of the tuyere and lengthened the tuyere so that the wind temperature could be directly injected into the center of the furnace, reducing the effect of erosion on the furnace wall. This improvement was agreed and supported by Soviet experts. Originally, the west furnace wall was already as thin as ten millimeters, but after internal and external maintenance and long-term sintering, the furnace wall has become thicker again.
    These achievements are inseparable from the establishment of normal working order in the production process.
    Before the implementation of the responsibility system, the production order of No. 1 Blast Furnace was quite chaotic. The workers often said: When something happens, no one cares, and when nothing happens, everyone is in charge.
    The duty room is the hub of the Iron Smelting Department, just like the command post of the troops. It should command all the teams that serve the blast furnace - hot blast stove, charging, furnace mouth, water watching, etc. But in the past, the organizational forms of these teams were the same as the duty room, all with foremen. Who led whom? Therefore, the work pace was very inconsistent. The outstanding performance was in personnel changes. At that time, it was often found that the day shift foreman transferred workers, but the night shift foreman did not know, and as a result, they went to the workers' dormitory in the middle of the night to find people. This inevitably affected blast furnace production.
    In January last year, the factory party and administrative leaders began to implement the responsibility system. The party branch committee of No. 1 Blast Furnace first organized all the workers to study and clearly recognized the benefits of the responsibility system. At the same time, the administrative side also rectified the unreasonable organizational structure. The original foremen of each group, such as the hot blast stove, were changed to technicians, who were solely responsible for technical guidance, and the daily work of the group was completely under the unified leadership of the duty room. The responsibility of the shift foreman has been increased, and they have also changed their working methods. A series of management systems such as planning, inspection, and summary have been established, and systems such as pre-shift meetings, post-shift meetings, large class meetings, and equipment inspection records have been established. The three shift foremen must arrange the work for the next week every Saturday and propose specific measures for each day; check the shortcomings of daily work and propose solutions. In this way, what should be done every day and what should be paid attention to are very clear to every worker.
      After the normal working order was established, the workers were able to work step by step. The shift foremen were able to take time to focus on studying and improving working methods and improving work efficiency. The furnace mouth is one of the most important sections of the blast furnace. Thousands of tons of molten iron and slag water in the blast furnace flow out from the furnace mouth and slag eye. The quality of the furnace door maintenance is directly related to the output of pig iron, and the amount of pig iron output is directly related to the speed of the country's industrialization. The workers deeply realized this, and with the help of the shift foremen, they improved the furnace mouth work several times. In February and March last year, the C-shift furnace mouth team took the lead in conscientiously summarizing and implementing the advanced experience of "digging large and baking dry" for the furnace door, and promoted it to the three shifts, so that the pass rate of the furnace door reached the national standard. From June to July, the three shifts jointly studied and improved the method of making mud sleeves, further solving the key problem of the mud-making machine's "running mud." From July to August, they improved the operation method of the furnace door, and implemented the method of digging and baking at the same time, digging deep and baking dry, so that the furnace door was more solid. After a series of improvements in working methods and changes in labor organization, they reduced eleven workers in the three shifts, saving more than a thousand man-days throughout the year. The crane room, hot blast stove and other groups also made great progress in their work last year. They did not have any accidents throughout the year, ensuring the smooth operation of the furnace.

Note: Ore Classification into the Furnace - The ore is divided into two or three grades according to different sizes of pieces, and charged into the furnace in batches. This increases indirect reduction, improves air permeability, and reduces coke ratio. Blast Furnace Top Regulation - Using the method of changing the charge to control the gas flow in the blast furnace, so that the gas is fully utilized and the furnace condition is guaranteed to run smoothly. Blast Furnace Steam Blowing - Adding appropriate steam to the blast into the blast furnace, controlling a certain humidity, to enhance the blast furnace smelting process and increase output.

    过去炉指挥人，现在人指挥炉
    本报记者　培蓝
    石景山钢铁厂炼铁部一高炉的全体职工，全面超额完成了一九五四年的国家生产计划，为国家创造了四十六亿九千万元的财富。增产生铁一万五千六百七十一吨（包括推迟大修生产的一万二千吨）。按照国家计划，生铁质量要求达到百分之九十九，实际达到了百分之九十九点五五；降低成本四十七亿元；提高劳动效率百分之二点七五；全年没有发生重大工业事故和人身事故。因为获得这许多成绩，一高炉被评为北京市的模范工段。他们选派了值班工长王才出席了北京市工业劳动模范大会。
    一高炉是个老炉，为什么能够超额完成生产任务呢？这是因为一高炉的全体职工在推广苏联先进经验当中，学习和掌握了先进的科学知识，提高了技术水平。用工人们自己的话说：过去是炉指挥人，现在是人指挥炉了。
    过去，一高炉的工人们掌握不了炉子，炉子经常发生塌料、悬料事故。事故发生了，也无法及时处理。那时候工人是听天由命：炉子运行得好，他们就操作自如；炉子发生毛病，他们就手忙脚乱。高炉产量忽高忽低，极不正常。
    为了扭转这种情况，一高炉的全体工人在一九五四年认真推广了苏联“矿石分级入炉”、“高炉炉顶调剂”、“高炉蒸汽鼓风”〔注〕等重要先进经验。
    在推广先进经验之前，一高炉的值班工长和全体工人首先学习了先进经验的技术理论和推广的具体方法。为了使工人系统地学习掌握高炉的技术理论，炼铁部还举办了值班工长技术学习班，由炼铁部工程师和值班主任轮流讲课。
    学习冶炼的基本理论，对高炉的值班工长来说是一件非常迫切、十分困难的事情。因为绝大多数值班工长都是由工人提拔的，他们有的根本没有念过书，有的念过一两年，慢慢都忘光了。解放后，他们参加了文化班学习文化。现在能看报纸了，听起课来却很吃力。他们每次听课都是凭脑子记，只能记住一半左右，如果记笔记，连三分之一也记不下来。后来他们下了最大的决心苦学死记。一高炉值班工长王才买了许多书，像着了迷一样，白天回家就让老婆抱着孩子出去玩，他在家里看书。夜里十二点下班回家，吃罢饭就一点多了，还要看书。有时候太困了，看一会就睡着了，他老婆悄悄把书拿过，给他盖好被子，这时却惊醒了他，找着书又看。有时候气得他老婆把灯关了，他等她睡着以后，又开灯继续看。其他工长也和王才一样，他们像暗地里展开竞赛似的，都在拚命地学习。值班工长宋玉林已经三十七、八岁了。他说：“我记忆力不如王才，我就一边看一边写，亲手写一遍比看一遍记得深。”他把科学根据和计算公式都记在笔记本上。
    他们从一月份开始学习，一直到十一月，成绩很好。过去炉子发生毛病，他们不管三七二十一，就减点风，使炉内少化铁；现在炉子发生毛病，他们就能研究是什么病，该用什么办法处理。学习给了他们一把钥匙。
    经过学习，他们逐步掌握了科学知识。一高炉又添置了一些必要的仪表。保证顺利贯彻上述三大先进经验。去年上半年，炉况一直很好。从下半年开始，因炉子太老，操作发生困难，产量降低了。但是，由于值班工长技术水平提高了，遇到这种情况也可以很好地处理；而且经过逐步摸索，找到了操作的规律，这就保证了炉况顺行，提高了产量。
    一高炉的确很老了，西边的炉墙已经很薄了。因为他们维护工作作的好，高炉的寿命延长了。
    高炉维护的好坏，决定于看水小组对冷却系统的维护和检查工作作的怎样。一高炉看水小组已经一千天没有发生事故了。他们在一九五三年就制订了详细的检查制度。由于执行的好，那年他们被评为车间的先进小组。这个小组一共七个人，都是青年小伙子，热情很高，干劲很大，学习先进经验也很快。可是以前有个缺点：干起来一阵风，过去就完了。看水小组的工人们工作很艰苦，他们每检查一次炉子，总要弄一身水。所以他们一年四季都是穿着很厚的帆布工作服，而且要穿两层。夏天穿了帆布衣，里边流汗，外边流水；冬天穿了帆布衣，外边结冰里边化。正因为这样，有的工人就不按制度检查。他们每班只有两个人，有时候两个人一商量就不检查了。去年以来，大伙变了，认识到加强冷却系统的维护工作对延长高炉的寿命有重要意义，他们建立了责任制和巡回检查制，每个人都检查了过去忽冷忽热和缺乏认真负责精神的毛病，于是责任心更加强了。过去每班对炉门、炉腹、炉壁立水箱只检查一次，现在增加到炉门每班检查八次，炉腹、炉壁各检查两次。他们不管酷热的夏天，也不管严寒的冬季，不分昼夜地爬上高炉测量炉温检查水箱。他们常常被炉子熏的脸直疼，被水浇的全身透湿，但他们从来没有间断过一次。去年一年，一高炉十几次停风检修，没有一次因看水小组的工作不好而影响一分钟。
    看水小组的工人们不仅加强了检查工作，而且还研究改进了一些设备。高炉西边的炉墙薄了，在炉内的水箱很快就给烧坏了。他们建议在炉外增加喷水管，加强冷却设备，维护高炉，使高炉正常运行。
    高炉值班工长和热风炉小组的工人，也积极研究，加强高炉的维护工作。他们在值班主任谢茂春的帮助下，研究出改进风嘴的方法。他们把风嘴口径缩小，风嘴加长，使风温直接向炉子中间喷射，减少侵蚀炉墙的作用。这个改进得到了苏联专家的同意和支持。原来西边炉墙已经薄到十米厘了，经过内外维护，长期烧结，炉墙又加厚了。
    这些成绩，和他们在生产过程中建立了正常的工作秩序是分不开的。
    在没有实行责任制以前，一高炉的生产秩序还相当混乱。工人们常说：有事无人管，无事乱当家。
    值班室是炼铁部的枢纽机关，就像部队的指挥所一样。它应该指挥所有为高炉服务的小组——热风炉、上料、炉口、看水等小组。可是过去，这些小组的组织形式和值班室一样都有工长，究竟谁领导谁呢？所以工作步调很不统一。突出的表现在人事调动上。那时候常常发现这样的情况：白班工长调动了工人，夜班工长不知道，结果半夜里到工人宿舍去找人。这样势必影响高炉生产。
    去年一月份，工厂党和行政领导开始贯彻责任制。一高炉党分支委员会首先组织全体工人学习，明确认识了责任制的好处。同时行政方面也整顿了不合理的组织机构。把热风炉等各组原来的工长改为技师，专门负责技术指导，小组的日常工作完全由值班室统一领导。值班工长的责任加重了，他们也改变了工作方法。建立了计划、检查、总结一系列的管理制度，建立了班前会、班后会、大班会、设备检查纪录等制度。三班工长要在每星期六安排下一周的工作，提出每日的具体措施；检查每天工作的缺点，提出解决的办法。这样，每天应该做些什么，注意什么，每个工人心里都很清楚。
      正常的工作秩序建立起来以后，工人们就能按部就班地工作。值班工长们就能抽出时间，抓住重点研究改进工作方法，提高工作效率。炉口是高炉最重要的工段之一，高炉里熔化的千万吨滚滚的铁水和渣水，都要从炉口和渣眼流出，炉门维护的好坏，直接关系着生铁的产量，生铁产量多少，又直接关系着祖国工业化的快慢。工人们深深体会到这一点，他们在值班工长的帮助下，几次改进炉口工作。去年二、三月份，以丙班炉口小组为主，认真总结和贯彻了炉门“挖大烤干”的先进经验，推广到三班，使炉门合格率达到国家要求的标准。六、七月间，三班共同研究改进了做泥套的办法，进一步解决了打泥机“跑泥”的关键问题。七、八月间，又改进了炉门的操作方法，实行边挖边烤的办法，挖的深，烤的干，使炉门更加坚固。经过工作方法一系列的改进，改变了劳动组织，他们三班共减去了十一个工人，全年共节省了一千多人工。吊车房、热风炉等小组，去年一年工作也有很大进步，他们全年没有发生任何事故，保证了炉子顺行。注：矿石分级入炉——把矿石按照不同的大小块度，分成两级或三级，分批入炉。增加间接还原，改善透气性，降低焦比。高炉炉顶调剂——用改变装料的方法，以控制高炉炉内煤气气流，使煤气被利用最充分，并保证炉况顺行。高炉蒸汽鼓风——在向高炉的鼓风内加入适当的蒸汽，控制一定的湿度，来增强高炉冶炼进程，提高产量。
