Some Research Achievements of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1954

The research work of the various institutes under the Chinese Academy of Sciences has achieved considerable success in 1954.

In terms of technical sciences, a large amount of experimental research work was carried out in connection with the development of the iron and steel industry, including ore dressing, smelting, and refractory materials. To meet the needs of coking coal for iron and steel industrial areas, research on coking raw material bases was conducted, and long-term coal types were determined. In the study of alloy steel, a substitute for the Soviet 40X automobile steel – manganese-molybdenum alloy steel – was successfully trial-produced, providing new steel grades suitable for China's resource conditions for our metallurgical industry and machine manufacturing industry. In powder metallurgy research, the Dalian Steel Plant was assisted in mastering powder metallurgy methods, and five types of TK cemented carbide were produced, initially solving the problem of sintering distortion that affects quality, providing excellent alloys for mechanical cutting and mining exploration. Bronze oil-impregnated bearings have also been successfully trial-produced and can be used in textile machinery and other machinery.

In terms of biological sciences, the study of chlortetracycline physiology found that inoculation media can affect the unit yield of chlortetracycline, and methods to increase the unit yield of chlortetracycline were found. The study of the life history of laver solved the problem of spore sources for artificial laver cultivation. Investigation and research on locust areas in Weishan Lake and Hongze Lake identified the occurrence patterns, feeding habits, and physiological phenomena of locusts in these two areas, providing important data for the complete control of locusts in Weishan Lake and Hongze Lake areas. Research on cotton boll shedding proved that insufficient light affects abscission, thereby suggesting improvements in agricultural cultivation techniques such as pruning and leaf removal. In terms of vertebrate paleontology research, three human fossil teeth equivalent to the Peking Man era were discovered in Dingcun Village, Xiangfen County, Shanxi Province. In terms of earth sciences, earthquake investigation and research identified the seismic intensity of many cities and regions, and regional seismic maps were compiled as a basis for seismic design for various industrial sectors. Research on medium-term weather forecasting played a certain role in flood control work. In terms of climate research, some reference materials were provided on the climate of the Yellow River basin, especially in terms of rainfall. In participating in the investigation and research work of the Yellow River basin, scientific data on topography, soil, plants, and other aspects were provided for the Yellow River planning.

In physics, preliminary results were obtained in the study of alloy composition rules regarding the relationship between the combination of two groups of secondary elements and the crystal structure. In mathematics, valuable results were obtained in the research of topology and the theory of functions of several complex variables. In chemistry, great achievements have been made in the research of fermentation, refining, and crystallization of chlortetracycline. New progress has also been made in the research of organosilicon. Research on antischistosomal antimony agents also has good results. Achievements have also been made in the research of rare elements.

In terms of social science research, the research on minority languages completed the improvement plans for three languages: Xishuangbanna Dai, Nujiang Lisu, and Dehong Dai in Yunnan. In terms of archaeological research, more than 100 ancient tombs of the Warring States, Han, and Tang dynasties were excavated in Xi'an, Baoji, and other places. The ruins of the Western Han Dynasty Henan county town were excavated in Luoyang, and it was inferred from historical records that this was the first ancient city in China, "Wangcheng." A Neolithic Age Yangshao culture site was discovered in Banpo Village, Chang'an, Shaanxi. In addition, more than 400 tombs from the Warring States period were also explored. In terms of modern history research, some work has been done in collecting and sorting materials and writing a small number of papers for the study of the Chinese bourgeoisie, the Chinese bourgeois revolution, the modern history of international relations in China, and the history of Taiwan.

    中国科学院一九五四年的一些研究成果
    中国科学院所属各研究所的研究工作，在一九五四年都获得了不少的成就。
    在技术科学方面，配合钢铁工业的发展，进行了大量的选矿、冶炼及耐火材料等试验研究工作。为钢铁工业地区炼焦用煤的需要，进行了炼焦原料基地的研究，确定了长远用煤煤种。对合金钢的研究，试制出苏联40X汽车钢的代用品——锰钼合金钢，为我国冶金工业、机器制造工业提供出适合我国资源情况的新钢种。在粉末冶金研究方面，协助大连钢铁厂掌握了粉末冶金方法，制成了五种TK硬质合金，初步解决了影响质量的烧成扭曲问题，为机械切削及矿山钻探提供了优良的合金。青铜含油轴承也已试制成功，可以在纺织机械以及其他机械上应用。
    在生物科学方面，对金霉素生理的研究，发现接种培养基能影响金霉素的单位产量，并找到了提高金霉素单位产量的方法。对紫菜生活史的研究，解决了紫菜人工养殖的孢子来源问题。微山湖和洪泽湖蝗区的调查研究，找出了这两区蝗虫发生的规律、食性、生理现象等，为根治微山湖和洪泽湖区蝗虫提供了重要资料。棉花落蕾落铃的研究，证明了光照不足，影响脱落，从而可以提出整枝、去叶等农业耕作技术的改进。古脊椎动物研究方面，在山西襄汾县丁村发现了三枚相当于北京猿人时代的人类化石牙齿。在地学方面地震的调查研究，鉴定了许多城市和地区的地震烈度，编制出区域地震图，供各产业部门作为防震设计的依据。中期天气预告的研究，对防洪工作起了一定的作用。在气候研究方面，对黄河流域气候，特别是雨量方面提供了一些参考资料。参加黄河流域的调查研究工作中，提供了黄河规划中的地形、土壤、植物等各方面的科学资料。
    物理学方面，在合金组成规律的研究中，对于两族副族元素化合问题和晶体结构的关系，获得初步成果。数学方面，在拓扑学和多元复变数函数论方面的研究获得了有价值的结果。化学方面，对金霉素的发酵、提炼和结晶的研究，已收到很大的成绩。对有机矽的研究，也有了新的进展。对抗血吸虫病锑剂的研究，也有很好的效果。对稀有元素的研究工作也获得了成绩。
    在社会科学研究方面，对少数民族语文的研究，完成了西双版纳傣文、怒江傈僳文、云南德宏傣文三种文字的改进方案。考古学研究方面，在西安、宝鸡等地发掘了战国、汉、唐各时代古墓一百多座。在洛阳发掘出西汉河南县城遗址，根据文献记载推断这是中国第一座古城“王城”。在陕西长安半坡村发现了新石器时代仰韶期遗址。此外并探出战国墓四百多座。在近代史研究方面，对于研究中国资产阶级、中国资产阶级革命、中国近代国际关系史和台湾历史等方面，作了一些收集整理资料的工作，写成了少数的论文。
