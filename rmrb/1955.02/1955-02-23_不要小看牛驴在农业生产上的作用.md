Don't Underestimate the Role of Cattle and Donkeys in Agricultural Production
Zhao Qi

Disregarding the role of cattle and donkeys in agricultural production has become a widespread problem. Many agricultural production cooperatives in various regions refuse to allow members to bring their cattle and donkeys into the cooperative. Some agricultural production cooperatives sell cattle and donkeys at low prices and buy mules and horses at high prices. In some areas, there have been instances of indiscriminate slaughter of cattle and donkeys.

Some cadres of agricultural production cooperatives believe that cooperatives are economic entities of a semi-socialist nature, and the use of small livestock cannot demonstrate their superiority. Indeed, agricultural production cooperatives should demonstrate their superiority. But this superiority should be manifested in: running the cooperative well, planting crops well, reaping abundant harvests, distributing more harvests to members, gradually carrying out capital construction with public accumulation funds, and obeying national plans, etc. If the cooperative can use cattle and donkeys to increase production, it will further demonstrate its superiority. Some cooperatives that attempt to show superiority by adding mules and horses, on the contrary, expose their own inferiority. Some agricultural production cooperatives in the fourth district of Keshan County and the fourteenth district of Nehe in Heilongjiang insisted on replacing cattle with horses, causing most of the members to become indebted. Isn't this very inferior?

Some cadres of agricultural production cooperatives believe that cattle and donkeys are useless for using new-style animal-drawn farm implements. According to the experience of some areas in Hubei and Shanxi provinces, cattle and donkeys can not only pull new-style farm implements, but also require less investment and lower costs. According to the measurement of Hubei New Farm Implement Station, double-wheeled double-shared plows, disc harrows, and ten-row seeders among the new-style animal-drawn farm implements can all be pulled by cattle. According to the station's measurement, the cost of plowing per mu with mules is 5,438 yuan, while the cost of plowing per mu with water buffalo is only 3,830 yuan.

Some people say that they do not want to use cattle and donkeys for farming because cattle and donkeys are inefficient. The efficiency of cattle and donkeys is indeed lower than that of mules and horses. But the difference is not significant. According to the measurement of Hubei New Farm Implement Station, under normal circumstances, when working in groups, cattle are only one-fifth to one-third slower than mules and horses. According to the experiments of Xiaoguozhuang and Xinzhuang agricultural production cooperatives in Changzi County, Shanxi, three horses and one person can plow and harrow more than 13 mu of land per day, and three donkeys and one person can plow 12 mu of land per day. According to the experience of Nehe, Heilongjiang, one horse can handle 6 to 7 *qing* of cultivated land, and one cow can handle 5 to 6 *qing* of cultivated land. According to a fairly accurate calculation, an agricultural production cooperative with 300 mu of land, if using a seeder, will only take one day longer to sow with cattle than with horses. This impact is not significant.

In many areas, cattle and donkeys account for a large proportion of draft animals. Like Changzhi Prefecture in Shanxi, there are a total of 440,000 draft animals, including 280,000 cattle, 120,000 donkeys, and only 40,000 mules and horses. Of course, mules and horses are very good draft animals, and mules and horses should be well protected and used. However, it is very wrong to underestimate the role of cattle and donkeys because of this.

    不要小看牛驴在农业生产上的作用
    赵起
    轻视牛、驴在农业生产中的作用，目前已成为一个带有普遍性的问题。许多地区的农业生产合作社拒绝社员带牛、驴入社。有些农业生产合作社低价卖出牛、驴，高价买回骡、马。有的地区发生了滥杀牛、驴的现象。
    有些农业生产合作社的干部，认为合作社是半社会主义性质的经济，用小牲口显示不出它的优越性。的确，农业生产合作社是应该显示它的优越性的。但是这种优越性应该表现在：办好社，种好地，多收庄稼、多给社员分配收获物，以公积金逐步进行基本建设，服从国家计划，等等。合作社如果能够使用牛、驴增加生产，更会显示它的优越性。有些企图用添买骡、马来显示优越性的合作社，反倒暴露了自己的不优越。黑龙江克山县四区、讷河十四区有些农业生产合作社硬要把牛换成马，使大部社员都负了债，这不是很不优越了么？
    有些农业生产合作社的干部认为要使用新式畜力农具，牛、驴是不中用的。根据湖北、山西等省一些地区的经验，牛、驴不但能牵引新式农具，而且投资少，成本低。据湖北新式农具站的测定，新式畜力农具中的双轮双铧犁、圆盘耙、十行播种机都能用牛牵引。据这个站测定，用骡子犁地，每亩成本五千四百三十八元，用水牛犁地，每亩成本仅三千八百三十元。
    有人说，他不想使用牛、驴种地，是因为牛、驴效率低。牛、驴的效率，是比骡、马低一些。但是低的并不多。据湖北新式农具站测定，在一般情况下，成组工作时，牛比骡、马的效率慢五分之一到三分之一。另据山西长子县小郭庄、辛庄等农业生产合作社的试验，三马一人一天可犁、耙十三亩多田，三驴一人一天可犁十二亩田，据黑龙江讷河经验，一匹马可负担六、七垧耕地，一头牛可负担五、六垧耕地。根据相当精确的计算，一个拥有三百亩田的农业生产合作社，如果用播种机播种，使用牛牵引比用马牵引至多延长一天，这种影响是不大的。
    许多地区，牛、驴在耕畜中占的比重是很大的。像山西长治专区，共有耕畜四十四万头，其中有牛二十八万头，驴十二万头，骡、马仅有四万头。当然，骡、马都是很好的耕畜，应该很好地保护和使用骡、马。但是，因此而轻视牛、驴的作用却是很不对的。
