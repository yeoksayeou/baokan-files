A Case of Obtaining Construction Funds Through Deception

To the Editor:

    The budget for construction projects formulated by the Basic Construction Department of Harbin Institute of Technology in 1954 exceeded the actual budget by 39%. After discovering this problem, the Tenth Construction Site of the Northeast Fifth Engineering Company of the Construction Engineering Department, which contracted for this project, not only did not request the client to revise the plan, but also took this opportunity to obtain a large amount of construction funds from the Construction Bank through deception.

    When this construction site signed the engineering entrustment agreement with the Institute of Technology at the beginning of 1954, the budget for the mechanical practice factory alone was 32.285 billion yuan, and the main electrical building was 19.0089 billion yuan. From mid-April, both parties began to prepare the technical design budget. The result of the joint compilation on July 15 was: 19.848 billion yuan for the practice factory and 11.3112 billion yuan for the main electrical building, a total reduction of 20.214 billion yuan from the initial budget. During the joint compilation of the budget by both parties, agreement was reached on the issues arising during preparation. A contract for the project should have been signed based on the compiled figures, and project payments should have been settled accordingly. However, the person in charge of the construction site, citing the large initial budget and the small compiled budget requiring further review, delayed signing the contract and continued to settle project payments with the client according to the initial figures in the agreement, while internally managing the construction according to the construction budget. Later, we discovered this problem and stopped paying them for project settlements on September 20. At this time, the construction site had already received 36.679 billion yuan in construction funds for the practice factory and main electrical building projects alone, equivalent to 117% of the initial technical design budget value of these two projects. By September 20, the project progress was only 63.55%. This means that the Tenth Construction Site prematurely obtained 16.876 billion yuan of the state's construction funds through deception. This is a serious violation of the state's financial system.

    After obtaining a large amount of state construction funds through deception, the person in charge of this construction site hoarded it in their own "pocket." Their deposits in the bank in mid-September reached 5.4 billion yuan, and they said: "It's enough even if the bank doesn't allocate any more funds." The waste at this construction site is serious. For example, on October 14, two beams in the main electrical building project were lost due to the poor quality of the truss beam wood, resulting in a loss of 4.75 cubic meters of concrete and 0.35 cubic meters of planks in one instance. On one occasion, a mistake in the foundation line of the outer wall of the main electrical building resulted in a loss of 26 cubic meters of rubble concrete and 50 cubic meters of earthwork. They received 1,200 cubic meters of timber from the Institute of Technology, while the project only needed about 600 cubic meters. They used 4.5 cm and 5 cm thick steel plates to pave roads and placed steel plates in rainwater pits, and so on.

    The above situation shows that the person in charge of this construction site has a serious tendency towards departmentalism and a weak sense of economic accounting. However, the reason why the above problems could occur in the first place is that the work of the Basic Construction Department of Harbin Institute of Technology was chaotic, and the initial budget was too large and was not corrected in time. Of course, the First Ministry of Machine Building, which approved this budget, should also learn a lesson from this.

### 一件套取建设资金的事情

    一件套取建设资金的事情编辑同志：
    哈尔滨工业大学基本建设处制订的一九五四年建设工程概算超过实际预算百分之三十九。而承包这个工程的建筑工程部东北第五工程公司十工地在发现这个问题以后，不但不提请甲方修改计划，反而借此机会大量向建设银行套取建设资金。
    这个工地在一九五四年年初同工业大学签订工程委托协议书时，其中仅机械实习工厂的概算就有三百二十二亿八千五百万元，电机主楼有一百九十亿零八千九百万元，甲乙双方自四月中旬开始编制技术设计预算，到七月十五日会编结果：实习工厂是一百九十八亿四千八百万元，电机主楼是一百一十三亿一千二百万元，两项工程共比年初概算减少了二百零二亿一千四百万元。在双方共同会编预算过程中，对编制中的一些问题，已经逐项取得协议，本来应该根据会编的数字签订包工合同，并进行工程价款结算；但是，工地的负责人却借口甲方概算大，编出的预算小，需要进一步审核，拖延签订合同，并且仍然按年初协议书的概算数字同甲方结算工程价款，而在工地内部则按施工预算掌握施工。后来，我们发现了这个问题，在九月二十日停止支付给他们结算工程价款。这时，这个工地仅在实习工厂和电机主楼工程上，已经领得建筑资金三百六十六亿七千九百万元，相当于这两项工程技术设计初步预算价值的百分之一百一十七，而到九月二十日为止，工程进度则仅完成百分之六十三点五五。这就是说，十工地提前套用了国家的建设资金达一百六十八亿七千六百万元。这是一种严重违犯国家财政制度的行为。
    这个工地负责人套用了国家大批建设资金以后，却在自己的“荷包”里积压着。他们九月中旬在银行的存款即达五十四亿元，并且说：“银行再不拨付也够用了。”这个工地的浪费情况是严重的，例如十月十四日在电机主楼工程中有两个梁由于桁架梁木材质量不好，一次就损失了混凝土四点七五立方公尺，板子零点三五立方公尺。有一次由于电机主楼外墙基础错线差一公尺的距离，也损失了毛石混凝土二十六立方公尺，土方五十立方公尺；从工业大学领到木材一千二百立方公尺，实际上工程只需要六百立方公尺左右；拿四点五公分厚和五公分厚的铁板垫道路用，把钢板放在雨水坑里等等。
    上述情况，可以看出这个工地负责人的本位主义思想是严重的，而经济核算思想则是薄弱的。但，上述问题之所以有可能发生，首先是因为哈尔滨工业大学基本建设处工作混乱，概算订的过大而没有及时纠正。当然批准这个概算的第一机械工业部也应该从这里吸取教训。
