On January 1st of this year, the Vietnamese people held a grand ceremony to welcome President Ho Chi Minh and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam back to the capital. On that day, President Ho Chi Minh and other leaders of the Party and government reviewed the heroic Vietnamese People's Army troops in Ba Dinh Square, Hanoi, and received cheers from hundreds of thousands of people from all over the country. On September 2, 1945, in the same Ba Dinh Square, President Ho Chi Minh solemnly declared Vietnam's independence to the same jubilant masses and to the world. Nearly ten years have passed since then. After countless difficulties and setbacks, today, the Vietnamese people have finally achieved the first victory in their great national liberation struggle. Peace has been achieved, and half of the motherland has broken free from the shackles of the colonialists and gained freedom. At the same time, the Geneva Conference has recognized that independence, democracy, and unity are the inalienable national rights of the Vietnamese people. The road traveled by the Vietnamese people in the past ten years has been a road of arduous struggle and a road of glorious victory.

When the powerful mechanized infantry, air defense, and artillery units of the Vietnamese People's Army rumbled past the reviewing stand in Ba Dinh Square on January 1st of this year, who could have imagined what this army looked like when it was first born ten years ago? On December 22, 1944, in the "Tran Hung Dao" jungle in Bac Giang province in northeastern Vietnam, the first unit of the People's Army was established under the leadership of the Indochinese Communist Party. The total number of people was thirty-four, and all the weapons were two pistols, seventeen rifles, fourteen homemade guns, and one light machine gun. The next day, this team fought a battle, successfully eliminating two small enemy strongholds overnight. The Vietnamese People's Army thus opened up a path to victory that was far from smooth. After the surrender of Japanese fascism, the young Vietnamese People's Army faced the French colonial army, which possessed superior equipment and was supported by American interventionists. France invested a large number of troops in order to reconquer Indochina. Before the ceasefire, the total number of French and puppet troops in Indochina exceeded 550,000. France invested more than three trillion francs in military spending. During the war, American interventionists provided France with more than 2.9 billion U.S. dollars in money and hundreds of thousands of tons of combat materials. However, in the face of the Vietnamese people with a strong determination to fight for national liberation, the French colonialists and American interventionists suffered an irreparable defeat. Four hundred and sixty-six thousand one hundred and seventy-two French colonial troops were annihilated in the rice fields and jungles of Vietnam, and nearly 10,000 were also eliminated in Laos and Cambodia. The number of officers that France lost in Indochina each year exceeded the number of officers who graduated from the Saint-Cyr Military Academy, France's highest military academy, each year. France was forced to replace the commander of the French army in Indochina eight times. In contrast, the Vietnamese People's Army, after years of arduous guerrilla warfare, and after seven campaigns from 1950 to 1954, grew stronger day by day. The Vietnamese People's Army has developed from a guerrilla force into a regular army capable of carrying out large-scale operations such as the liberation of Dien Bien Phu. The Vietnamese People's Army equipped itself with weapons seized from the enemy. When people saw the People's Army soldiers entering Hanoi with their captured mountain guns, howitzers, and automatic weapons, the enthusiastic cheers drowned out the rumbling of the gun carriages. They cheered the victory achieved by this people's army in the past ten years, and cheered this strong pillar force of the Vietnamese people's struggle for peace, unity, independence, and democracy.

In January, two grand conferences were held in succession at the Hanoi Grand Theater. These two conferences have extraordinary significance, which shows the great achievements made by the Vietnamese people in the political struggle in the past ten years.

The first conference was the meeting to commemorate the ninth anniversary of the general election day held on January 6. Nine years ago, on January 6, 1946, the Vietnamese people were able to exercise their sacred right for the first time—to choose their own government through general elections. In almost all provinces across the country, more than 90% of voters participated in the election, and in Saigon-Cholon, which was occupied by the French army, 82% of voters conducted secret voting despite the danger. The National Assembly elected by the people of the whole country has representatives from all strata, political parties and groups, and ethnic groups. The National Assembly passed the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and elected a coalition government with Ho Chi Minh as chairman. The provinces and villages also elected local people's representative conferences, and the local people's representative conferences elected the people's administrative committees at the same level. In this way, a government chosen by the people and serving the people was born. From its establishment, this government has guaranteed the realization of the people's various democratic rights and national equality rights. This government once led the Vietnamese people in a heroic war of resistance, and is now leading the people to realize the transition from war to peace. Under the leadership of this government, the Vietnamese people quickly and effectively completed the reception work in large cities such as Hanoi and newly liberated areas, and are engaged in large-scale reconstruction work. The ability and efficiency shown by this government cannot be denied even by the enemy. American columnist Joseph Alsop recently said helplessly after visiting Vietnam: The achievements of the Vietnamese government in the past nine years "very clearly confirmed my own short-term observations of (this agency's) efficiency, strength, and popular support."

Encouraged by past achievements, many representatives who spoke at the January 6th commemoration of the general election day expressed their willingness to actively struggle to successfully hold the free general election stipulated by the Geneva Conference and to crush the conspiracies of the United States and its followers to undermine the general election and obstruct the unification of Vietnam.

The day after this conference, another conference was held immediately, which was the National Congress of the Vietnam National United Front. The representatives attending this conference represented a wide range of strata, which symbolized that the great unity of the Vietnamese people is becoming more and more consolidated and developed. The people of the vast strata of Vietnam, under the leadership of the Indochinese Communist Party—the predecessor of the current Vietnam Labor Party—have formed a strong united front based on the worker-peasant alliance. Various democratic parties, people's organizations, and patriotic democratic人士 participate in the Vietnam National United Front, a united front organization that united the Vietnamese people in the past and victoriously carried out the war of resistance. Now, faced with the new situation, this organization must be further consolidated and expanded. The National Congress of the Vietnam National United Front, held from January 7 to 11, has decided to convene a broader national congress to pass a new political program and a new organizational law suitable for the new situation.

Now, the worker-peasant alliance, which is the foundation of the Vietnamese people's democratic regime and the united front, has been further consolidated due to the development of the rent reduction and interest rate reduction movement and the land reform movement. From the implementation of the policy of thoroughly reducing rent in early 1953 to the end of 1954, rent reduction has been completed in 1,008 villages in 15 provinces. The population of these more than 1,000 villages is more than 4.2 million. Since the implementation of land reform in early 1954 to the end of 1954, land reform has been completed in 269 villages in four provinces. There are more than 680,000 residents in these 269 villages. After the land reform, the rural productive forces were liberated, the peasants' enthusiasm for production was greatly improved, and the power organs, the Vietnam Labor Party branches, and the peasant associations were also rectified and consolidated. The peasants, who had been freed from generations of feudal oppression, celebrated their emancipation and liberation.

During the most difficult years of the war of resistance, President Ho Chi Minh called for self-reliance and resistance. Over the past ten years, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has successfully realized this call in its economic work. The conditions were difficult. Under the destruction and burning of the French colonial army, many farmlands were barren. For example, in the newly liberated areas and former guerrilla areas in the Red River Delta alone, there were nearly 120,000 hectares of wasteland, and tens of thousands of heads of livestock and tens of thousands of tons of rice were lost. The cities were occupied, and the people who retreated to the mountainous rural areas had to build the necessary industries in the absence of machinery, raw materials, skilled workers, and technical experience. In order to obstruct the enemy's advance, it was also necessary to destroy the enemy's transportation lines. However, as President Ho Chi Minh often said:

"Nothing is difficult in the world, except for the fear of a lack of perseverance; even moving mountains and overturning seas can be accomplished with determination." The strong and resolute Vietnamese people overcame all difficulties and created miracles. Workers built military and civilian industries in the mountains and rural areas. They were able to manufacture weapons such as rifles, grenades, mortars, and rocket launchers, and also produced a large part of the paper, ink, phosphates, and many daily necessities needed in the liberated areas. The peasants overcame the enemy's sabotage and natural disasters, carried out a patriotic production increase competition, guaranteed the supply of grain, and made significant contributions to the war of resistance. With the development of the war of resistance, the Vietnamese people also restored and newly opened more than 3,000 kilometers of roads from 1950 to 1954. These all guaranteed the victory of the war of resistance. After the ceasefire, the government is using great strength to restore agricultural production. About one-fifth of the 120,000 hectares of wasteland has now been restored to cultivation, and six important water conservancy irrigation systems in the north have been restored to irrigation one after another. At the same time, the Hanoi-Nanguan Railway, which connects Vietnam and China, is being rapidly repaired, and more than 1,200 kilometers of roads have been repaired and opened to traffic. The handicrafts in various places have been further developed under the leadership of the government, and some damaged coal mines have resumed mining. A prosperous and happy future is unfolding before the Vietnamese people.

People can also see the achievements of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in economic work from the financial budget. When the August Revolution in Vietnam succeeded in 1945, the central treasury only had 1.25 million piastres. The government relied on the people's voluntary donations, the people's enthusiastic payment of taxes, and the issuance of public bonds to cope with financial difficulties. From July 1951, the government rectified the finances and gradually achieved a balance of payments from deficit. In 1947, income was equivalent to 34% of expenditure, but by 1953, income had exceeded expenditure, accounting for 116% of expenditure.

On the cultural front, 90% of the Vietnamese people were illiterate in the past, but now more than 13 million former illiterate people have learned to read. The number of primary and secondary school students in Vietnam has exceeded one million. During the war of resistance, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam had already established medical universities, normal universities, and other institutions of higher learning. Now these schools are preparing for further development to train cadres needed for national construction.

The international status of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is improving day by day. Today, eleven countries, including the Soviet Union and China, have recognized the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The prime ministers of India and Burma have successively visited Hanoi, paving the

    越南民主共和国的伟大成就
    新华社记者　沈定一　张结
    今年一月一日，越南人民举行了欢迎胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府还都的盛大典礼。这一天，胡志明主席以及党和政府的其他领袖们，在河内的巴亭公园，检阅了英勇的越南人民军部队，接受了来自各地的十几万群众的欢呼。一九四五年九月二日，在同一个巴亭公园，胡志明主席向着同样欢欣若狂的群众，向着全世界，庄严地宣告了越南的独立。从那时起到现在，将近十年的岁月过去了。经过无数的困难和曲折，今天，越南人民终于在伟大的民族解放斗争中取得了第一回合的胜利。和平实现了，祖国的一半挣脱了殖民者的锁链，得到了自由。同时，日内瓦会议已经承认独立、民主和统一乃是越南人民不可剥夺的民族权利。十年来，越南人民所走过的道路是艰苦斗争的道路，也是光荣胜利的道路。
    当今年一月一日，越南人民军强大的机械化步兵部队、防空部队和炮兵部队隆隆地通过巴亭公园检阅台前面的时候，谁能想到这支部队十年前诞生时的面貌。那是在一九四四年十二月二十二日，在越南东北部北江省名为“陈兴道”的丛林中，人民军的第一支队伍在印度支那共产党的领导下成立了。全部人数是三十四人，所有的武器是两支手枪、十七支步枪、十四支土枪和一挺轻机枪。第二天，这支队伍就打了一次仗，在一夜中成功地消灭了敌军的两个小据点。越南人民军就这样打开了通往胜利但是远非平坦的道路。在日本法西斯投降后，年青的越南人民军又面对着拥有优势装备并且为美国干涉者所支持的法国殖民军了。法国为要重新征服印度支那，投入了大量的军队。停战前，在印度支那的法军和伪军总数超过五十五万人。法国投入的军费超过了三万亿法郎。在战争中美国干涉者给了法国二十九亿美元以上的金钱和几十万吨的作战物资的支持。然而，在具有争取民族解放的坚强决心的越南人民面前，法国殖民者和美国干涉者遭到了无可挽救的失败。法国殖民军四十六万六千一百七十二人在越南的稻田和丛林中被歼灭了，在老挝和柬埔寨，也有将近一万人被消灭。法国每年在印度支那丧失的军官数目超过了法国最高军事学院圣西尔军校每年毕业军官的数目。法国被迫八次撤换印度支那法军的统帅。相反的，越南人民军经过艰苦的游击战争的年代，经过从一九五零年到一九五四年间的七次战役的锻炼，一天天地壮大起来。越南人民军从游击队发展到能进行像解放奠边府这样大规模作战的正规部队了。越南人民军用夺自敌人手中的武器装备了自己。当人们看见人民军战士带着他们缴获的山炮、榴弹炮和自动武器进入河内时，人们热情的欢呼声淹没了辚辚的炮车声。他们欢呼这一支人民军队十年来取得的胜利，欢呼越南人民争取和平、统一、独立和民主的斗争的这一支坚强支柱力量。
    一月份，在河内大戏院接连举行了两个隆重的大会。这两个大会有着不平常的意义，它所说明的是越南人民近十年来在政治斗争中所取得的伟大成就。
    第一个大会是在一月六日举行的纪念普选日九周年的大会。九年前，一九四六年一月六日，越南人民第一次能运用自己的神圣权利——通过普选来选择自己的政府。几乎在全国各省，都有百分之九十以上的选民参加选举，在法军占领下的西贡—堤岸，也有百分之八十二的选民不顾危险进行了秘密投票。全国人民选出的国民大会中有各阶层、各政党团体、各民族的代表。国民大会通过了越南民主共和国宪法，并且选出了以胡志明为主席的联合政府。各省，各乡村也选举了地方人民代表会议，地方人民代表会议选出同级的人民行政委员会。这样，一个人民所选择的，为人民服务的政府诞生了。这个政府从一成立起就保障了人民各项民主权利和民族平等权利的实现。这个政府曾经领导越南人民进行了英勇的抗战，现在又正在领导人民实现着从战争到和平的转变。在这个政府的领导下，越南人民迅速、有效地完成了河内等大城市和新解放地区的接收工作，并且正在从事大规模的恢复建设工作。这个政府表现出来的能力和效率，就连敌人都无法否认。美国专栏作家约瑟夫·艾尔索普最近在访问越南后无可奈何地说：越南人民政府九年来的成就“非常清楚地证实了我自己短时期内对（这个机关）的效率、力量和人民的支持的观察”。
    为过去的成就所鼓舞，在一月六日纪念普选日的大会上发言的许多代表都表示要进行积极的斗争，争取成功地举行日内瓦会议所规定的自由普选，粉碎美国和它的追随者破坏普选、阻挠越南统一的阴谋。
    在这次大会后的第二天，紧接着举行了另一个大会，这就是越南国民联合战线全国代表大会。出席这个大会的代表们代表了广泛的阶层，这就象征着越南人民的大团结愈来愈巩固和发展。越南广大阶层的人民在印度支那共产党——现在的越南劳动党的前身——的领导下结成了一条以工农联盟为基础的坚强的统一战线。在越南统一战线组织——越南国民联合战线中，有各民主政党、各人民团体和爱国民主人士参加，这个统一战线组织在过去团结了越南人民，胜利地进行了抗战。现在，面对着新的形势，这个组织还要更加巩固和扩大。在从一月七日到十一日之间举行的越南国民联合战线全国代表大会，已经决定召开一次更广泛的全国性大会，以通过适合于新形势的新的政治纲领和新的组织法。
    现在，作为越南人民民主政权和统一战线的基础的工农联盟，由于减租减息运动和土地改革运动的发展而更加巩固了。从一九五三年初实行贯彻减租政策到一九五四年底，已经在十五个省一千零八个乡中完成了减租。这一千多个乡的人口在四百二十万人以上。从一九五四年初实行土地改革以来，到一九五四年底，已经在四个省二百六十九个乡完成土地改革。这二百六十九个乡中共有居民六十八万多人。经过土地改革后，农村生产力得到了解放，农民生产积极性大为提高，政权机关、越南劳动党支部、农会也得到整顿和巩固。摆脱了多少世代的封建压迫的农民们，欢庆着自己的翻身和解放。
    在抗战最艰苦的年代里，胡志明主席曾经号召自力更生，进行抗战。十年来，越南民主共和国在经济工作中胜利地实现了这个号召。条件是困难的。在法国殖民军的破坏烧杀下，多少农田荒芜了，如仅在红河三角洲新解放地区和以前游击区中，就有近十二万公顷的荒地，成万头耕畜、成万吨稻谷损失了。城市被占领了，撤退到山地农村的人们得在缺乏机器、原料、熟练工人和技术经验的条件下建设必需的工业。为了阻挠敌军的前进，还必须破坏敌人的交通运输线。然而正像胡志明主席常说的：
  “天下无难事，只怕心不坚；排山和倒海，决心也能成。”坚强刚毅的越南人民排除万难，创造了奇迹。工人们在山地和农村中建设起了军事工业和民用工业，他们能够制造步枪、手榴弹、迫击炮和火箭筒这些武器，也生产了解放区所需的一大部分纸张、油墨、磷酸盐和许多日用必需品。农民们战胜了敌人的破坏和自然灾害，进行了爱国主义增产竞赛运动，保证了粮食的供应，对抗战作出了重大的贡献。而随着抗战的发展，越南人民从一九五零年到一九五四年间还恢复和新开辟了三千多公里的公路。这些都保证着抗战的胜利。停战后，政府正以极大的力量来恢复农业生产，十二万公顷的荒地中现在已有约五分之一恢复耕种，北部六个重要的水利灌溉系统先后恢复灌溉了。同时，联接越中两国的河内—南关铁路正在迅速修复中，一千二百多公里的公路已经修复通车。各地的手工业在政府领导下已经更加发展起来，一些遭到破坏的煤矿恢复开采了。在越南人民的面前展开了繁荣幸福的前景。
    人们从财政预算表上也可以看出越南民主共和国在经济工作中的成就了。当一九四五年越南八月革命成功的时候，中央国库只有一百二十五万皮阿斯特。政府依靠了人民的志愿捐献、人民踊跃缴纳税款和发行公债等办法来应付财政困难。从一九五一年七月开始，政府整顿了财政，逐渐由入不敷出达到收支平衡。一九四七年，收入相当于支出的百分之三十四，到一九五三年，收入已经超过支出，为支出的百分之一百十六了。
    在文化战线上，过去，越南人民中有百分之九十是文盲，现在已经有一千三百万以上过去的文盲认识了字。越南中小学生的数目已经超过了一百万。越南民主共和国在抗战期间就已经建立起医科大学、师范大学等高等学校，现在这些学校都准备进一步发展，为国家培养建设所需要的干部。
    越南民主共和国的国际地位正一天比一天提高。今天，已经有苏联、中国等十一个国家承认了越南民主共和国。印度和缅甸总理相继访问河内，为进一步发展越南民主共和国和这些东南亚国家的关系铺平了道路。最近，南亚五国总理会议又决定邀请越南民主共和国参加亚非会议。越南民主共和国也正在争取和法国建立正常的关系。
    回顾将近十年来走过的道路，越南人民有理由感到自豪。他们正在信心百倍地为击败美帝国主义者及其追随者的一切阴谋，为实现自己的崇高任务而奋斗。这些任务就是：巩固和平、完成统一、实现全国的独立和民主。
