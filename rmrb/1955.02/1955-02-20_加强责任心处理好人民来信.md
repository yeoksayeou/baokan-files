Response to Criticism and Suggestions

    Strengthen Responsibility, Handle People's Letters Well
    A joint letter from the Party Branch and Supervision Division of the Transportation Bureau of the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Transportation: The criticism of us in the article "Unsatisfactory Inspection Work" in the "Reader's Letters" column on November 28th of last year is correct. In mid-May of last year, Section Chief Zheng Tongjie had negative thoughts and lacked confidence about going to the Shangrao Repair Factory for inspection work. After arriving in Shangrao, he did not establish close contact with the factory leadership, so the work was not satisfactory. After we received the reader's letter forwarded by the People's Daily criticizing the work team, the cadres responsible for handling this issue did not fully understand the situation, and the Party Branch and the original Supervision Section did not carefully review the investigation report. Thus, we gave the People's Daily an irresponsible reply, which shows that our attitude towards handling people's letters was not serious enough. In addition to instructing Comrade Zheng Tongjie to conduct a thorough self-criticism, we are determined to strengthen our sense of responsibility in handling people's letters in the future and strive to do our work well.

专栏：批评建议的反应

    加强责任心处理好人民来信
    江西省交通厅运输局党支部和监察分室联名来信：去年十一月二十八日“读者来信专页”“不能令人满意的检查工作”一文对我们的批评是正确的。去年五月中旬郑同杰科长对于到上饶修理厂检查工作有着消极思想，缺乏信心，到上饶后又没有和修理厂领导方面取得密切联系，因此工作不能使人满意。当我们接到人民日报转来读者对工作组的批评信后，由于负责处理这个问题的干部了解情况不全面，党支部和原监察科对调查报告也没有详加审核，于是就给了人民日报一个不负责任的答复，这说明我们处理人民来信的态度是不够严肃的。我们除已责成郑同杰同志进行深刻检讨外，并决心今后加强处理人民来信的责任心，努力做好工作。
