To the Editor:
    There is a small “kingdom” in the Yichun forest area. Yu Wenzhang, the first deputy director of the Shuangzihe Forestry Bureau, is the "little king" of this independent kingdom. Since taking office in 1953, Yu Wenzhang has deceived those above him and oppressed those below, disregarding the law and causing serious losses to national wealth.

    The Shuangzihe Forestry Bureau's logging area is a forest region in the Lesser Khingan Mountains where coniferous trees account for more than half of the trees. According to the logging plan, the logging rate of coniferous trees should not exceed 60% here. However, Yu Wenzhang did not resolutely implement this plan and rarely educated employees on reasonable logging, resulting in a "plucking the big hairs" phenomenon in the forest area: logging only coniferous trees and not broad-leaved trees. In the first quarter of last year, according to the plan, the logging volume of broad-leaved trees should have accounted for 20% of the total logging volume, but in reality, it only accounted for 2%. To rush the task, Yu Wenzhang arranged for "sweeping the area," causing excessive logging and a serious "clear-cutting" phenomenon. According to a survey of one hectare in the first logging area of the Second Logging Farm in 1953, there were 144 tree stumps, leaving only three mother trees. According to a survey of 7,000 square meters in the third logging area in 1954, the entire area was clear-cut, leaving no mother trees. In addition, because the direction in which the timber fell was not well controlled, many young trees were killed or injured.

    The Shuangzihe Forestry Bureau included many capital construction costs and expenditures for purchasing fixed assets in the cost, and arbitrarily lowered wage quotas, resulting in the product cost exceeding the plan every month. The cost overrun for the entire year of 1954 was estimated to be 41.54%, and the cost overrun for the third quarter was 51.2%. Instead of using legitimate methods to change this situation, Yu Wenzhang used base means of falsely reporting achievements and deceiving superiors to cover up his mistakes and gain honor. In 1953, many forestry production departments across the country were responding to the call of the Party and the government to find shortcuts, tap potential, practice strict economy, and strive to complete the production tasks. On the evening of December 31, 1953, seeing that the annual production task could not be completed and eager to "show merit" to his superiors, Director Yu Wenzhang ordered Zhou Qing, the director of the lumberyard, and Li Wencheng, the dispatcher, to force the statistician overnight to falsely add "2,000 cubic meters of timber received at the lumberyard" to the statistical table. At the same time, he sent a telegram to the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the then Northeast Forestry Administration to "report victory," saying that "the production task was completed 20 days ahead of schedule." Since then, Yu Wenzhang has been using the excuse that a batch of timber was transported to workshops six, seven and eight between December 7th and 13th, but was not measured, to deceive the superior's inspection, and on the one hand, he reported the loss of the 2,000 cubic meters of timber falsely added to the statistical table during the inventory of assets, in an attempt to cover up the mistake. Yu Wenzhang's illegal act seriously disrupted the state's timber allocation plan and undermined the state's financial discipline.

    Director Yu Wenzhang's acts of undermining state financial discipline did not stop there. He arbitrarily approved the use of state treasury timber worth 107.1 million yuan to build schools, dormitories and cellars, of which 21 meters (worth more than 10 million yuan) were used as firewood. He spent so much money without asking for instructions beforehand or completing allocation procedures afterwards, and simply wrote it off as a loss of finished products during the inventory of assets. Similar facts like these, amount to as many as ten major items and fifty-four minor items in the Shuangzihe Forestry Bureau, causing a loss of nearly 20 billion yuan to the state. The majority of this should be the responsibility of Director Yu Wenzhang.

    In addition, Director Yu Wenzhang also frequently used public funds to satisfy his personal desires, such as asking the General Affairs Section to buy a black bear for him to play with, using public funds to repair hunting rifles and buy ammunition for him to hunt squirrels, and using the excuse of buying an "ambulance" to actually buy a medium-sized truck for himself to learn how to drive. His private life is also not serious.

    The above-mentioned acts that harmed the interests of the Party and the state naturally aroused the dissatisfaction of the workers and masses. Therefore, Yu Wenzhang used his authority to suppress those who dared to offer him opinions and promoted a group of "trusted cadres" to consolidate his personal rule. Sun Yuanlan, the acting deputy director of the Production Section, was originally not approved for appointment by the superior administration, but Yu Wenzhang has always allowed her to control the power in the section. Zhang Zheng, the original director of the Production Section, and six or seven other Party members and Youth League cadres with upright work styles were squeezed out to the logging farm. Technician Tan Zhenting, who adhered to principles, was falsely accused of "embezzlement" and forced to retire. Yu Wenzhang even placed the Shuangzihe District Party Committee under his own will and power, and the Party organization could not criticize and supervise his mistakes and actions. Therefore, the workers and masses spread such words: "This is an unreasonable place, where Director Yu Wenzhang has the final say in everything."

    When these erroneous facts were revealed, the inspection team of the Ministry of Forestry invited him to listen to the report, Yu Wenzhang refused to participate, and said, "There have been many errors in principle in the past, but none of them have done anything to me..." This arrogant attitude is really intolerable.

### 伊春森林里的小“王国”

专栏：

    伊春森林里的小“王国”编辑同志：
    伊春森林区里有个小“王国”。双子河森林工业局第一副局长余文章就是这个独立王国的“小国王”。余文章自从一九五三年到职以来，欺上压下，目无法纪，给国家财富造成了严重的损失。
    双子河森林工业局的采伐作业地区是小兴安岭针叶树过半的林区。根据采伐方案规定，在这里进行采伐作业，针叶树的采伐率不得超过百分之六十。但是，余文章没有坚决执行这个方案，也很少对职工进行合理采伐的教育，以致林场上出现了“拔大毛”的现象：光采针叶树，不采阔叶树。去年第一季度，按照计划的规定，阔叶树的采伐量应占总采伐量的百分之二十，但实际上只占百分之二。为了赶任务，余文章就布置“刷场子”，造成砍伐过多和“剃光头”的严重现象。据一九五三年第二伐木场第一伐区一公顷面积内的调查，伐根一百四十四个，只留了三棵母树；又据一九五四年第三伐区七千平方公尺面积内的调查，全部被剃了光头，未留一棵母树。加上木材倒的方向掌握不好，砸死和砸伤的幼树很多。
    双子河森林工业局把许多基本建设费用和购买固定资产的开支都打进成本里面，擅自降低工资定额，以致产品成本月月超过计划。一九五四年全年成本预计超支达百分之四十一点五四，第三个季度，成本超支达百分之五十一点二。余文章不是用正当的方法来改变这种状况，却用虚报成绩、欺蒙上级的卑劣手段来粉饰过失，骗取荣誉。一九五三年全国许多林业生产部门都在响应党和政府的号召，找窍门，挖潜力，厉行节约，努力完成增产任务。就在一九五三年十二月三十一日晚上，余文章局长眼看全年生产任务不能完成，又急于向上级“表功”，于是他责成贮木场长周清和调度长李文成漏夜强迫统计员凭空在统计表上虚加了“贮木场到材二千立方公尺”，一面就打电报向中共黑龙江省委会和当时的东北森林工业管理局“报捷”，说是“提前二十天完成生产任务”。此后，余文章一直借口十二月七日到十三日间，在六、七、八三个车间有一批木材运来后没有检尺，来蒙混上级的检查，一方面又把统计表上虚加的二千立方公尺木材在清产核资中报了损失，企图掩盖错误。余文章的这一非法行为严重地打乱了国家的木材调拨计划，败坏了国家的财政纪律。
    余文章局长败坏国家财政纪律的事件还不止如此。他曾擅自批示动用国库木材价值达十亿七千一百万元，拿去盖学校建宿舍和修菜窖，其中甚至有二十一公尺（值一千多万元）是用去当了柴火烧。他花了这许多钱，事前既不请示，事后又不补办调拨手续，竟在清产核资中以产成品亏损报销了事。类似这样的事实，在双子河森林工业局多达十大项，五十四小项，给国家造成的损失将近二百亿元。其中大部分应由余文章局长负责。
    此外，余文章局长滥用公款来满足个人生活欲望的事实也很多，例如要总务科买黑熊养着供自己玩，用公款修理打围枪和买弹药供自己打灰鼠，借口买“救护车”而实际上买了一辆中卡车供自己学着开。他的私生活也很不严肃。　　上述这许多损害党和国家利益的行为，当然激起职工群众的不满，于是余文章就利用职权，一手打击敢于向他提意见的人，一手提拔一批“心腹干部”，以巩固个人统治。现在的生产科代理副科长孙原兰原是上级管理局不肯批准任命的，但余文章却一直让她掌握科里的大权。原来的生产科长张正和其他六、七名作风正派的党员团员干部则被排挤到伐木场去。坚持原则的技术员谭珍庭被诬为“贪污嫌疑”，被迫使退职。余文章甚至把双子河地区党委会放在自己的意志和势力之下，党的组织不能对他的错误和行为进行批评和监督。所以职工群众中流行着这样的话：“这是个不讲理的地方，凡事余文章局长说了算。”
    当这些错误事实被揭发以后，林业部的检查组邀请他听取汇报，余文章拒不参加，并说“过去原则性的错误有的是，都没有把我怎么样……”。这种骄横傲慢的态度实在令人不能容忍。樊万瑞　高绍章
