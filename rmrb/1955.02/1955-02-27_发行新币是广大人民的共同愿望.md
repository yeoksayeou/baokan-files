Since the State Council issued the order on February 21 concerning the issuance of new Renminbi and the withdrawal of the existing Renminbi, this newspaper has received many letters from readers expressing their warm support for this important economic measure by the government. Many readers mentioned a common understanding in their letters, which is that the issuance of new Renminbi on the basis of the fundamental improvement of China's financial and economic situation, the balance of financial revenue and expenditure, and the stability of financial prices not only marks the further improvement and consolidation of China's monetary system, but also demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of China's political and economic systems. Xiong Renfei from China Department Store wrote: The state's issuance of new Renminbi is fundamentally different from the so-called "currency reform" during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. In those dark years of rule, the Chinese people suffered at the hands of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Inflation and soaring prices were commonplace. Each currency change was nothing more than a trick played by the reactionary ruling clique to intensify the plunder and exploitation of the people's wealth. In the five years since the founding of New China, the monetary system of the Kuomintang reactionary rule has been fundamentally changed, and an unprecedented state of price stability has emerged throughout the country. Therefore, the issuance of new Renminbi will only further guarantee the happy life of the people. Many readers described in various aspects the countless benefits that the issuance of new Renminbi brings to the country's economic construction and the people's lives.

Rong Xilin from the Materials Supply Company of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Construction Engineering Bureau wrote: The issuance of new Renminbi is fully suitable for the needs of national economic construction. This year is the third year of our country's planned economic construction. With the further development of construction undertakings, the figures for calculating funds in various economic tasks are very large. Because the face value of the current Renminbi is very large and the unit value is very low, in calculation work, it is often calculated in units of ten thousand, which is very inconvenient to use and causes great waste in manpower and material resources. After the issuance of new Renminbi, it will greatly simplify the calculation work and improve work efficiency, which is of great benefit to our country's construction cause. The staff of the Finance and Accounting Section of the Beijing Municipal Company of China Department Store wrote: The state's measure to issue new currency and reduce the face value of the current Renminbi is very correct. In our daily work, we deeply experience that the current Renminbi is not compatible with the increasing development of the country's construction undertakings and the increasing expansion of the scope of commodity circulation. In our work, we often deal with huge numbers such as hundreds of millions, billions, and trillions, which are very complicated to calculate. A number often requires drawing many "zeros," and the larger the number, the easier it is to make mistakes. It is also very inconvenient to use an abacus. Now, using the new currency will greatly help improve the financial and accounting work of national economic agencies. The adoption of new currency not only simplifies the unit of calculation, but also saves a lot of unnecessary labor, reduces errors, and improves work efficiency in various tasks such as invoicing, bookkeeping, and table preparation.

The issuance of new Renminbi is also very convenient for the broad masses of people to use currency in their daily lives. Fang Zihang from Beijing Green Treasure Fountain Pen Factory wrote: With the development of our country's economic construction, the material living standards of the people are constantly improving. People often have to use currencies with large numbers when buying things and conducting transactions, which is very inconvenient to use. The new Renminbi has reduced the face value, and the patterns, colors, and sizes of each denomination are uniform, and they are printed in four languages: Han, Tibetan, Mongolian, and Uyghur. The main currency and auxiliary currency types are simple, and the differences are very obvious, so that even illiterate people can easily recognize them.

E'nen Aola, a Daur student from the Marxist-Leninist Research Class of the Renminbi University of China, wrote: The images on the new currency are very solemn and of great historical significance. These images are a vivid socialist education for the broad masses of people. As a minority student, when I saw the image of "Great Unity of All Nationalities" printed on the five-yuan note, I deeply felt the warmth of the motherland's big family. The new currency issued this time is printed in four languages: Han, Tibetan, Mongolian, and Uyghur, which not only facilitates the circulation of the new currency throughout the country and the development of the economy in minority areas, but also demonstrates the party and government's meticulous care for the people of minority nationalities.

Many readers expressed in their letters that they would cherish the new Renminbi. Some readers also suggested that when using the new currency, do not fold the banknotes, do not crumple or tear them, and do not write or scribble on the new currency to keep the new currency clean and beautiful, and to extend the circulation and use time of the banknotes. In addition, many readers suggested that the important significance of issuing new currency should be vigorously publicized to ensure the smooth progress of the issuance of new currency.

    发行新币是广大人民的共同愿望
    二月二十一日，国务院发布了关于发行新的人民币和收回现行的人民币的命令以后，本报收到许多读者来信表示热烈拥护政府这一重要的经济措施。许多读者在来信中都提到一个共同的认识，这就是：在我国财经状况已经根本好转，财政收支平衡和金融物价稳定的基础上发行新的人民币，不仅标志着我国货币制度的进一步健全和巩固，而且也更加表现出我国政治制度和经济制度的无比优越性。中国百货公司熊任飞来信说：国家发行新的人民币和国民党反动统治时期的所谓“币制改革”是根本不同的。在那黑暗统治的岁月里，中国人民吃过国民党反动派的苦头。通货膨胀、物价飞涨是司空见惯的事情。每次的币制更换，都不过是反动统治集团为了加紧掠夺和搜括人民财富玩弄的花招。新中国建国五年来，已经根本改变了国民党反动统治时期的货币制度，在全国范围内出现了空前未有的物价稳定的状况，因此，发行新的人民币只会更加保障人民的幸福生活。很多读者从各方面叙述了发行新的人民币给国家经济建设和人民生活带来的说不尽的好处。
    北京市人民政府建筑工程局器材供应公司荣锡麟来信说：发行新的人民币完全适合于国家经济建设的需要。今年是我国有计划地进行经济建设的第三年，随着建设事业的进一步发展，各项经济工作中计算资金的数字十分庞大。由于现行的人民币票面额很大，单位价值很低，在计算工作中常常以万为计算单位，使用很不方便，在人力物力上造成很大浪费。发行新的人民币以后，就会大大简化计算工作，提高工作效率，这对于我国的建设事业是有很大好处的。中国百货公司北京市公司财会科的工作人员们来信说：国家发行新币，缩小现行人民币的票面额的措施是十分正确的。我们在日常工作中深切地体验到现行的人民币和国家建设事业的日益发展以及商品流转范围日益扩大的情况是不相适应的。我们在工作中常和百亿、千亿、万亿等庞大的数字打交道，计算起来十分繁杂，一个数字常常要画许多个“零”，数字越大就越容易发生错误。打起算盘来也非常不方便。现在改用新币对于改进国家经济机关的财务会计工作是有很大作用的。采用新币不仅简化了计算单位，同时在开票、记账、制表等各项工作中都会节省许多不必要的劳动，减少差错，提高工作效率。
    发行新的人民币对于广大人民群众在日常生活中使用货币也是十分方便的。北京绿宝金笔厂方孜行来信说：随着我国经济建设事业的发展，人民群众的物质生活水平不断地提高，人们在购买东西，进行交易的时候经常要动用数目字较大的货币，使用起来很不方便。新的人民币缩小了票面额，而且每种票券的图案、颜色和大小都是统一的，并且印上了汉、藏、蒙、维吾尔四种文字，主币和辅币种类单一，不同之处十分显明，这样，就连不识字的人也容易辨认。
    中国人民大学马列主义研究班达呼尔族学生垩嫩·敖拉来信说：新币的图景是十分庄严和具有重大历史意义的。这些图景对广大人民群众是一种生动的社会主义教育。我是一个少数民族学生，看到五圆券上印的是“各民族大团结”的图景的时候，我深深地感到祖国大家庭的温暖。这次发行的新币上都印上了汉、藏、蒙、维吾尔四种文字，这不仅便于新币在全国流通和发展少数民族地区的经济，而且表现了党和政府对少数民族人民无微不至的关怀。
    许多读者在来信中都表示要爱护新的人民币。有些读者并且建议大家在使用新币时，不要把钞票折叠，不要乱揉乱扯，更不要在新币上乱写乱涂，以保持新币的干净和美观，延长钞票的流通使用时间。此外，很多读者提出应大力宣传发行新币的重要意义，以保证发行新币的工作顺利进行。
