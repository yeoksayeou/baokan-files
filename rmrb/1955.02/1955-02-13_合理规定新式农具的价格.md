    Reasonably Regulate the Prices of New Agricultural Tools
    To the Editor:
    The "53" type walking plow produced by the Liuzhou Machinery Factory in Guangxi has been rewarded by leading organizations; farmers are also very interested in this kind of walking plow. The ex-factory price in 1954 was 280,000 yuan per unit. This year, in order to support farmers' vigorous production, after innovating products, improving quality, and reducing costs, the ex-factory price was changed to 250,000 yuan per unit, a reduction of 30,000 yuan compared to the previous year. Farmers are naturally very happy about the reduction in the price of agricultural tools. However, the price of the walking plow after it leaves the factory has increased at each level through the promotion of supply and marketing cooperatives at the provincial, prefectural, county, and district levels. For example, the original ex-factory price of the walking plow was 250,000 yuan per unit, but when the Provincial Cooperative Bureau unified the price, it stipulated that the price of each walking plow should be 295,000 yuan. By the time it reached the Guilin Prefectural Supply and Marketing Cooperative, it had increased to 300,500 yuan per unit. From Guilin Prefecture to Lingui County (which is only three miles away from Guilin City), the Supply and Marketing Cooperative further increased it to 332,600 yuan per unit. By the time it reached the Wutong District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, which is sixty miles away, the price per unit had increased to 368,000 yuan, which is nearly one-third higher than the ex-factory price. The transportation in these places is very convenient, but the price of walking plows varies greatly, which is very unreasonable. The weight of a walking plow is only about 15 kilograms, and even with the addition of freight, it should not be so high. This unreasonable price will affect farmers' purchase of new walking plows and should be corrected.

### 合理规定新式农具的价格

    合理规定新式农具的价格编辑同志：
    广西柳州机械厂出产了一种“五三”型步犁，曾经得到领导机关的奖励；农民对这种步犁也很感兴趣。一九五四年出厂的价格是每架二十八万元，今年为了支援农民大力生产，经过革新产品、改进质量、降低成本以后，每架出厂价格改为二十五万元，比以前降低了三万元。农民对于降低农具价格自然是十分欢迎的。但是，步犁出厂以后的价格通过省、专区、县、区各级供销合作社的推销便层层加大了。如：步犁出厂价格原是每架二十五万元，省合作局在统一价格时规定每架步犁的价格是二十九万五千元，到了桂林专区供销合作社每架又增加到三十万零五千元，由桂林专区到临桂县（同在桂林市相距不过三里路远），供销合作社每架又增加到三十三万二千六百元，再到六十里路远的五通区供销合作社，每架的价格便增加到了三十六万八千元，比出厂价格高出了几达三分之一。上面这些地方的交通非常方便，但是步犁的价格却相差很大，这是很不合理的。一架步犁的重量不过十五公斤左右，就是加运费也不能高到这种程度。这种不合理的价格是会影响农民购买新式步犁的，应该纠正。
