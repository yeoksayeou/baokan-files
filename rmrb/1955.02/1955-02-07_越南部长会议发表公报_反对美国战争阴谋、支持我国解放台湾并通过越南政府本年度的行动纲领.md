Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 6th: The Council of Ministers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam held a meeting in early February, presided over by President Ho Chi Minh.

The meeting issued a public communique stating that the Council of Ministers studied the world situation and believed that:

(A) In recent days, the American imperialists have been actively realizing their conspiracies to establish military blocs in Europe and Asia, such as forcing France to ratify the Paris Agreements on the rearmament of West Germany, establishing the aggressive Southeast Asia group, and concluding a military treaty with Chiang Kai-shek, thereby deepening world tensions in order to prepare for war.

The conspiracies of the imperialist war-mongers are being fiercely opposed by many governments and peace-loving people around the world. The people of Europe are continuing to struggle against the ratification of the Paris Agreements; the people of Asia are united in their struggle against the Manila Treaty and against the convening of the Bangkok Conference; the people of Asia and Africa unanimously welcome the upcoming Asian-African Conference.

(B) Taiwan is Chinese territory. The Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan, which proceeds from their legitimate interests. The Vietnamese people firmly support the just struggle of the Chinese people.

The communique also said that the Council of Ministers discussed and adopted the action program of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for 1955. The main points of this program are as follows: (A) Faithfully implement and strive for the other party to correctly implement the Geneva Armistice Agreements;

(B) Restore the national economy, especially agricultural production, in coordination with land reform; repair transportation lines; restore various small industries and handicrafts. The purpose of the entire economic plan is to heal the wounds of war and improve the people's living standards;

(C) Gradually transform and develop cultural and social activities; transform the people's education; develop vocational education; and lay the foundation for higher education. The purpose of public health work is to specifically address the urgent needs of the people, prevent and treat various diseases, especially epidemic diseases such as malaria and trachoma; pay full attention to social relief issues; (D) Strengthen the Vietnamese People's Army; (E) Consolidate the people's political power at all levels in accordance with the policy of expanding and strengthening the national united front; and gradually implement the policy of establishing autonomous regions for ethnic minorities.

The Council of Ministers also discussed the issue of re-establishing relations in all aspects between northern and southern Vietnam on both sides of the temporary military demarcation line in order to restore the normal life of the people; the Council of Ministers adopted a statement on this issue.

In addition, the Council of Ministers decided to launch a patriotic competition movement to increase agricultural production in the spring of 1955.

The Council of Ministers also decided to change the Ministry of Agriculture to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.
