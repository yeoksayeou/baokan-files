    Troubles of the Planning Section

To the Editor:

　　On October 23, 1954, the Yitang Coal Mine Preparatory Office received an instruction from the Coal Mine Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry regarding the control targets for basic construction and production investment for 1955, deciding that our office would build a new power plant of a certain capacity. We immediately began to prepare the plan. However, due to not knowing the size of the machinery and the source of the equipment, the work could not be carried out. For this reason, we sent two section chiefs to the Coal Mine Administration Bureau to find out the situation. We first went to the Planning Section, but they didn't know. Then we went to the Director of the Basic Construction Section. The Director told us to find the Section Chief, and the Section Chief introduced us to a staff member. This comrade told us that the machines were "ordered from abroad." Which country was it from? The first time they said it was from the Soviet Union, the second time they said it was from the German Democratic Republic, the third time they said it was from Romania, and finally they said it was from the German Democratic Republic again. As for the size of the specifications, we still didn't know. In November 1954, we received another notice from the General Bureau, asking us to gather in Beijing to compile the basic construction and production plan for 1955. We thought we could "solve the problem" all at once. But in the more than fifty days in Beijing, we went to the Coal Mine Administration Bureau more than ten times, and this problem was still not clear. How can the plan be formulated? How big of a plant building is needed to install this machine, and how much money is needed? We had no choice but to list an expenditure on the plan according to the control target notified by the Coal Mine Administration Bureau. What's even more strange is that when the order specifications for the generator were still unclear, as early as November 9, 1954, we received a notice from the Coal Mine Administration Bureau, instructing our office to "organize a site selection committee and report the results by the end of December." The task for 1955 had not yet been determined, and on September 29, 1954, the Supply Section of the Coal Mine Administration Bureau sent a telegram urging our office to "send personnel to Beijing from October 4th to 9th to pre-order the cement contract for 1955," and later continuously notified us to "pre-purchase timber," etc. Because the plan had not been drawn up, it was obvious that pre-purchasing too much would lead to stockpiling, and pre-purchasing too little would not be enough. As far as I know, Yitang Coal Mine is not the only place building such a large power plant this year. The chaotic work of the Coal Mine Administration Bureau is bound to hinder the smooth execution of tasks below.

### 计划科的苦恼

    计划科的苦恼编辑同志：
      一九五四年十月二十三日义棠煤矿筹备处接到燃料工业部煤矿管理总局关于一九五五年基本建设、生产投资控制指标的指示，决定我处新建一个若干瓩的发电厂。我们当即进行编制计划。但由于不知机器的规格大小和设备来源等，工作无法进行。为此，我们先后派了两个科长到煤矿管理总局了解情况。我们先找计划处，他们不知道，又找基本建设处处长，处长叫找科长，科长又介绍给科员。这个同志告诉我们机器是“国外订货”。究竟是哪一国的呢？第一次说是苏联的，第二次说是德意志民主共和国的，第三次说是罗马尼亚的，最后又说是德意志民主共和国的。至于规格大小还是不得而知。一九五四年十一月又接到总局通知，要我们到北京集中编制一九五五年基本建设、生产计划。我们以为一下子可以“解决问题了”。可是在北京的五十多天中，我们到煤矿管理总局奔走了十多次，这个问题还是没有弄清楚。计划怎样制订呢？装置这部机器需要建筑多大的厂房，需要花多少钱呢？只好在计划上按照煤矿管理总局通知的控制指标，列了一笔开支。更奇怪的是，当发电机的订货规格还弄不清的时候，早在一九五四年十一月九日，我们却接到煤矿管理总局的通知，责成我处“组织厂址的选择委员会，务于十二月底将结果报来”。一九五五年的任务还未确定，一九五四年九月二十九日，煤矿管理总局供应处就发来电报催促我处“派员于十月四至九日到京预订一九五五年的水泥合同”，以后又连续通知我们“预购木材”等等。因为计划没有编出，显然，预购多了要积压，预购少了不够用。据我所知，新建这样大的电厂，今年还不止义棠煤矿一处。煤矿管理总局的工作这样混乱，势必妨碍下面顺利地执行任务。义棠煤矿筹备处计划科科长　王建英
