Two Escorts

The Bengbu Food Company sent Zhu Guiyuan and Lu Zhongren to escort a wagonload of live chickens to Tianjin for delivery.

The train arrived at Yanzhou Station. Escort Zhu Guiyuan thought of enjoying the scenery of Yanzhou, so he got off the train and had a good time in Yanzhou city. However, the freight car strictly adhered to the travel time and did not wait for Zhu Guiyuan to return to the station, so it drove away. Zhu Guiyuan was already confident and unhurriedly bought a fast train ticket and chased after it for more than 300 li, finding the freight car at Jinan Station.

The other escort, Lu Zhongren, expressed great regret about this incident, because Zhu Guiyuan had a good time playing, but he didn't get to play, which was a loss. So, he took the name of being hungry and buying steamed buns, got off the train at Lianzhen Station, … afterwards, it seemed he had even better ideas than Zhu Guiyuan, taking a fast train for more than 470 li, arriving directly at the destination of the delivery - Tianjin, where he met Zhu Guiyuan. The two felt excited and happy from the bottom of their hearts, believing that they had not only completed a major escort task, but also had an enjoyable long journey. It was truly a "double win" and "taking care of both public and private interests."

However, who would take care of the chickens in the cages when they were hungry and thirsty? They couldn't speak and couldn't complain, so they had to endure the pain! According to the statistics after delivery at the Tianjin Food Company, more than 920 chickens were piled up, crushed to death, starved to death, and died of thirst in the cages, accounting for more than 51 percent of the total number transported.

Although such escorts are individual cases, there are many escorts who despise their work, neglect their duties, and do not cherish state property. They do not see the close relationship between the tasks they undertake and the lives of the broad masses of the people, and they do not treat their work with the responsible attitude that a honest state public servant should have. The incident of Zhu Guiyuan and Lu Zhongren damaging live chickens is very serious. The relevant leading departments should seriously investigate the responsibility for this incident and take corresponding measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again.

    两个押运员
    弓桑
    蚌埠食品公司派朱桂元、卢忠仁两人押运一车皮活鸡运往天津交货。
    列车开到了兖州车站。押运员朱桂元想起要欣赏一下兖州的风光，于是就下了车，在兖州城里畅玩了一番。可是，货车却严格遵守行车时间，没有等候朱桂元回到车站，就开走了。朱桂元早已胸有成竹，不慌不忙，补购了快车客票，追赶了三百多里路，到济南站找上了货车。
    另外一个押车的卢忠仁对这件事表示非常遗憾，因为朱桂元痛快地玩了一番，而他却没有玩上，吃亏了。于是他就以肚子饿买馒头为名，在连镇站下了车，……之后，好像比朱桂元还有办法，坐了四百七十多里的快车，一直到达了送货的目的地——天津，才和朱桂元会了面。两人从心眼里感到兴奋和愉快，他们认为既完成了一件重大的押运任务，又作了一次畅快的长途旅行。真是“一举两得”，“公私兼顾”。
    可是，鸡在笼子里饿了渴了，有谁去照料呢？它们不会说话，不能申诉，只得忍受痛苦！据在天津食品公司交货后统计，在笼子里打堆、压死、饿死、渴死的有九百二十多只鸡，占运输总数的百分之五十一以上。
    像这样的押运人员虽然是个别的；但是，在押运人员中轻视自己的工作，玩忽职守，不知爱惜国家财产的人，却不在少数。他们看不到所担负的任务和广大人民群众的生活有何等密切的关系，没有用一个正直的国家公务人员应具有的负责态度来对待自己所担负的工作。朱桂元、卢忠仁损害活鸡的事件，情节是十分严重的，有关领导部门应该严肃的追查这一事件的责任，并应采取相应的措施来防止类似事件的再发生。
