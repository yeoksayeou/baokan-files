Xinhua News Agency, February 8th news dispatch from Paris: February 6th was the National Day of Struggle Against Arming West Germany, decided upon by the French Peace Council. On this day, demonstrations were held in cities and villages across the country against the ratification of the Paris Agreements.

    People participating in the demonstrations laid wreaths at the monuments to those who sacrificed themselves in the war against Hitler's aggressors. At a monument in Guérard (Charente-Maritime), where Hitler's occupiers executed a group of French patriots in April 1944, 5,000 people gathered. They swore that they would never tolerate the arming of West Germany and would continue to fight against the ratification of the Paris Agreements.

    Similar demonstrations were held on this day in Paris, Pau in the Lower Pyrenees, villages in Indre-et-Loire, and other regions of the country.

    Workers in many factories and enterprises protested against West German remilitarization by going on strike. "L'Humanité" reported that a few days ago, 3,000 workers at the "Fives-Lille" machine factory in Lille went on strike and passed a resolution paying tribute to their German comrades who were fighting against German remilitarization.

    The Dordogne Committee for Peace and the Struggle Against Arming Germany wrote a letter to members of parliament, asking them to only vote for heads of government who would oppose the ratification of the Paris Agreements. The letter was signed by Béruges, a Socialist Party member and member of the provincial council, Guilmain, secretary of the provincial committee of the French Republican Youth League, Debergila, chairman of the provincial committee of the Radical Socialist Party, and responsible persons from other political parties.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 6th news dispatch from Paris, February 5th: The French newspaper "L'Humanité" reported that the Seine branch of the French Veterans Federation, which has 250,000 members, recently passed a resolution at a meeting reiterating its firm opposition to the revival of German militarism in any form. The resolution called for a peaceful resolution of the German question on the basis of four-power talks and the establishment of a European collective security system.

    Democratic newspapers published a letter from some professors at the University of Paris to all members of the Senate of the Republic. The letter stated, "We declare that the vast majority of staff at the University of Paris are opposed to the revival of German military power. The vote in the National Assembly has not yet completed the ratification process, and the Senate of the Republic can still save France's future and defend peace." The letter was signed by law professors at the University of Paris: René Capitant, Bernard Lavergne, and other prominent figures.
