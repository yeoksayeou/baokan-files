Changes in the Rural Market
　　Fang Tianbai
　　Ten Increases, Five Decreases
　　Since the implementation of the unified purchase and sale of grain and oil and the vigorous development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, several important changes have taken place in the rural market (including county-level primary markets directly related to the rural economy - the same below). At the conference of county, district, and township cadres held in Taikang County, Henan Province, each group summarized "what has increased and what has decreased" in their respective townships and villages over the past year? The unanimous conclusion was that there were ten major increases in the county over the past year:
　　1. Increase in agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams. The proportion of organized farmers increased from 24% of the total households in 1953 to 45% in 1954.
　　2. Increase in business volume of supply and marketing cooperatives. In 1954, the business volume of supply and marketing cooperatives in each district expanded by about two times compared to 1953.
　　3. Increase in credit cooperatives. There were eight cooperatives in 1953, which developed to 106 cooperatives in 1954. Now 70% of the townships have credit cooperatives. Many credit cooperatives have been able to fully shoulder the credit work of farmers in their respective townships, and some cooperatives have more deposits than they can lend out.
　　4. Increased socialist awareness of cadres and the masses. A large number of mutual aid teams have requested to be transformed into production cooperatives.
　　5. Increase in activists. The task of unified purchase of summer grain in 1954 was overfulfilled, and 37 model townships and 2,855 model grain sellers emerged.
　　6. Increase in production enthusiasm. In 1954, the county added 9,550 new manure ponds, 2,402 toilets, and 1,296 new pigpens. Farmers actively accumulated fertilizer to increase production.
　　7. Increase in mules and horses. Credit cooperatives organized farmers to purchase more than 2,000 livestock through loans.
　　8. Increase in large farm tools, new-style farm tools, and carts. 5,449 new-style and large farm tools and 1,626 carts were newly added.
　　9. Increase in new tile-roofed houses. In 1954, 14,376 new tile-roofed houses were built in the county.
　　10. Increase in people wearing new clothes. The county's cotton cloth company's sales of cloth in the first, second, and third quarters of 1954 increased by 7.28 times compared to the same period in 1953.
　　There were also five major decreases:
　　1. Decrease in land transactions. In 1953, 5,803 households in the county bought and sold land, totaling 14,694 mu. In 1954, this decreased to 959 households, 2,714 mu.
　　2. Decrease in grain hoarders. In 1953, there were 1,176 grain hoarding households. In 1954, there were only 48 households.
　　3. Decrease in hired laborers. In 1953, there were 856 households hiring laborers in the county. In 1954, this decreased to 570 households.
　　4. Decrease in land leasing. In 1953, there were 2,262 households leasing land. In 1954, this decreased to 1,965 households.
　　5. Decrease in speculative merchants. Market prices have been more stable in the past year than at any time in the past.
　　Similar situations have also occurred in other regions. For example, farmers in Xuedian Township, Shan County, Henan Province, said that unified purchase and sale brought "seven increases, four quickenings, and three decreases." The seven increases are: more livestock, more farm tools, more waterwheels for irrigation, more fertilizer used, more production cooperatives, more credit cooperatives, and more new houses. The four quickenings are: faster sales of chemical fertilizers, faster sales of building materials, faster sales of bicycle axles, and faster sales of cotton cloth. The three decreases are: less usury, less land transactions, and fewer idlers and lazy people.
　　The changes in rural life are just as many farmers praise: "Production increases, prices are stable, we can sleep peacefully at night, and we don't worry during the day." Even in disaster areas, under the leadership of the Party and the government, affected farmers have generally launched a "production for self-salvation, rebuilding homes" upsurge. Disaster victims gratefully say: "Only Chairman Mao and the Communist Party can turn autumn into spring!" The recovery of production and life is also very rapid.
　　These can be said to be a relatively complete microcosm of the current "prosperous" situation in rural areas across the country. It not only vividly depicts the clear outline of increased production and improved living standards in the vast rural areas, but also powerfully illustrates that thousands upon thousands of farmers are marching forward by leaps and bounds in the direction indicated by the general line. In the rural economy, socialist factors are growing day by day, and capitalist factors are declining. In a word, the basic situation in rural areas today is the tremendous achievement of the Party's policies in rural areas.
　　Several Important Changes in the Rural Market Situation
　　With the publicity and implementation of the general line, the unified purchase and sale of grain and oil, and the development and changes in rural economic life, many new situations and problems have emerged in the rural market. Such as:
　　1. The purchasing power of farmers has increased significantly, and the phenomenon of "supply falling short of demand" in the rural market has developed rapidly.
　　This is because:
　　(1) The publicity and implementation of the general line and the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain and oil have liberated the huge financial resources of many farmers that were originally tied up in speculation, hoarding grain, hiring laborers, buying land, and lending money, and transferred them to normal purchasing power for means of production and means of livelihood. For example, before the publicity and implementation of the general line and the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain and oil in Taikang County, due to the speculative activities of private merchants and rich peasants, grain prices continued to rise. In 1953, during the lean season, the market price of wheat rose to 2,400 yuan per jin (the listed price was 800 yuan). The grain company sold hundreds of thousands of jin of grain every day, but it still could not crack down on the black market. Later, even sweet potatoes rose to 1,400 yuan per jin, forcing some poor farmers to sell land to buy food. Everyone was unable to live in peace and engage in production. At that time, livestock prices fell by half, but few people wanted them. Wood, bricks, tiles, and furniture all fell sharply in price. Even the originally popular oil cakes had to be sold on credit for anyone to want them. After the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain in October 1953, grain prices have been stable, and there is no way to hoard grain or speculate. The idea of "buying livestock is not as good as buying land, buying land is not as good as lending money, lending money is not as good as hoarding grain" quickly disappeared, and "those who did not do their jobs properly all did their jobs properly." Everyone could live in peace and engage in production. In the first to third quarters of 1954, the supply and marketing cooperatives sold 34,557 wheat shovels, while in the entire year of 1953, only 20,753 were sold, and they still had to be sold on credit. In the first to third quarters of 1954, 54,583 brooms (for sweeping the threshing floor) were sold, while in the entire year of 1953, only 20,953 were sold, and they were still sold on credit. The consumption of means of livelihood also increased significantly compared to before the unified purchase and sale. Compared with the same period in 1953, the county department store's sales of glass increased by 1.3 times, bicycles increased by 4.6 times, socks increased by 2 times, undershirts increased by 4.6 times, bed sheets increased by 8 times, paint increased by 10 times, and kerosene increased by 5.2 times.
　　(2) Farmers sold more products than before the unified purchase and sale. For example, in the past, farmers generally "sold to buy," only selling some when they needed money. Now, except for the portion retained for their own use according to the unified purchase standards (food, feed, seeds, and reserve grain), almost all of it is sold to the state. The phenomenon of grain waste has also been greatly reduced. Moreover, as the country enters a period of large-scale economic construction, transportation is developing day by day, and the needs of cities, industrial and mining areas, and exports are increasing, the sales channels for rural native and sideline products have expanded, also increasing farmers' income.
　　(3) After the publicity and implementation of the general line and the implementation of unified purchase and sale, the vast majority of farmers' buying and selling is done through the supply and marketing cooperatives, greatly reducing the exploitation by merchants. The things they sell earn more, and the things they buy are cheaper than before. According to a survey by the Fujian Provincial Finance and Economics Committee, after the unified purchase and sale, the families of many village cadres in Nanping County (all of whom are farmers who do not leave production) have received about 500,000 yuan each in benefits over the past year due to the reduction of exploitation by merchants and participation in mutual aid and cooperation. The amount of intermediate exploitation reduced and the benefits given by the state to the 500 million farmers across the country is considerable, which has greatly increased the purchasing power of farmers.
　　Other factors, such as the large-scale development of rural credit cooperatives over the past year, have reduced the exploitation of many farmers by usury; the development of agricultural production cooperatives has generally increased yields by 15%; many places have built huge industrial, transportation, and water conservancy projects, absorbing a large number of farmers to participate in work, and making many rural areas "even stones and sand turn into money!" All of these have increased the income of farmers.
　　Due to the above reasons, the purchasing power of the vast number of farmers has increased even more rapidly on the basis of the already widespread improvement during the recovery period. According to preliminary estimates by the Finance and Economics Committee of the Central and Southern Provinces, although the Central and Southern regions suffered a major flood unseen in a century in 1954, the purchasing power of farmers in the entire region in 1954 was still not lower than in 1953, and even slightly increased. The situation of rising purchasing power of farmers in other non-disaster areas can be imagined.
　　This situation has forced the phenomenon of supply falling short of demand in the rural market to develop rapidly. For example, before 1953, department store goods did not sell very well in rural areas, but in 1954, a tense situation began to appear, and many department store goods were quite commonly out of stock.
　　2. The channels of exchange between urban and rural areas have undergone tremendous changes; the proportion of the rural market in domestic commerce has expanded.
　　Due to the unified purchase and sale of grain, oil, cotton cloth, etc., state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperative commercial enterprises have basically controlled the source of industrial and agricultural products, and have implemented long-distance direct allocation from the place of production to the place of sale throughout the country, reducing the levels of material circulation, greatly weakening the connection between urban and rural capitalism. The vast majority of farmers' buying and selling is done through local state-owned companies or cooperatives. Private merchants in the rural market have also shifted from relying on urban wholesalers to purchase goods from local state-owned companies and cooperatives. Therefore, the position of the rural market in domestic commerce has become increasingly important, while the trend of urban (except for a few emerging industrial cities) commerce is declining. According to statistics from the Jiangsu Provincial Finance and Economics Committee, in the fourth quarter of 1953, the withdrawal of rural currency accounted for 38.52% of the total amount of currency put into circulation in urban and rural areas throughout the province. In the fourth quarter of 1954, the withdrawal of rural currency is expected to reach 60.21% of the total amount of currency put into circulation in urban and rural areas throughout the province. This significant change in the circulation of currency between urban and rural areas shows that the position of urban and rural markets in domestic commerce has undergone tremendous changes.
　　If we do not understand that such a major change has taken place in the relationship between urban and rural markets, and fail to change the original deployment of urban and rural commercial work accordingly, then there will be situations such as "urban overstocking and rural out of stock" and "the commercial surplus in some large and medium-sized cities, while the commercial work in rural areas cannot keep up with the requirements of the objective situation," which cannot meet the needs of farmers and hinder urban-rural exchange, and will make our work fall into a passive and unfavorable situation.
　　In the situation of such a drastic transformation in the relationship between urban and rural markets, many places have generated a debate on "whether the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas is smooth." Some people see that urban commerce is declining and the market situation is not as active as before, and say that this is the result of "unsmooth urban-rural exchange" and "obstruction of urban-rural relations." Others see that the turnover of the rural market has greatly increased, and affirm that "urban-rural exchange is unobstructed," saying that the view of "unsmooth urban-rural exchange" is completely "out of thin air" and has no basis at all. This debate is extremely instructive for today's commercial work. Because the former have not recognized that today, state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperative commercial enterprises have spread throughout urban and rural areas across the country, and have basically controlled the source of major industrial and agricultural products. Under such conditions, it is impossible to produce a situation of "unsmooth urban-rural exchange" and "obstruction of urban-rural relations" that is wider in scope or of a fundamental nature. The latter have not recognized that because China has a vast territory and very uneven economic development, in the situation of such rapid changes in urban-rural commercial relations, although state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives have spread throughout the country and have controlled the source of major industrial and agricultural products, if they have not made good use of the original channels of urban-rural exchange, or have not expanded the circulation of goods accordingly to the requirements of economic development, then it is entirely possible that some materials or some regional urban-rural exchange will be unsmooth and obstructed. The actual situation of current urban-rural commercial relations is: basically smooth, while there are obstructions and blockages in some materials or local areas. For example, state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives have not done a good job in managing many small department store goods needed in rural areas and many small native products needed in urban areas and for export, and have not made full use of private merchants and peddlers to transport and sell them, thus forming a "decoupling between urban and rural areas" for these materials. There are also many secondary, and even major, commodities that are constantly experiencing "decoupling" phenomena in certain regions, at certain times, and for certain varieties due to the shortcomings of the work of state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives themselves and the failure to make good use of the original channels of urban-rural exchange, and cannot well meet the requirements of the people.
　　The proportion of the rural market in domestic commerce has expanded. This change in the situation requires not only commercial work to catch up in a timely manner, but also other departments such as transportation, banking, and taxation should quickly strengthen the work of the rural market, otherwise it will cause losses and passivity.
　　3. Farmers' economic life is further incorporated into the state plan, the free market is rapidly shrinking, and the responsibility of socialist commerce for the rural market is greatly increased.
　　The above changes in the rural market have created favorable conditions for further incorporating the rural economy into the state plan, better improving farmers' lives and expanding urban-rural exchange, and facilitating the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and rural private merchants. On the other hand, they have also increased the responsibility of socialist state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperative commercial enterprises for the rural market.
　　First of all, the original urban-rural commercial channels have undergone tremendous changes under the new situation. Socialist commerce must quickly rectify and improve the new urban-rural commercial relations, and the rural commercial network must also be quickly enriched and arranged to further expand urban-rural exchange and commodity circulation in rural areas.
　　Secondly, after the connection between farmers' economic life and the free market is greatly weakened, the things that farmers sell and buy mostly go through the supply and marketing cooperatives. In the future, the purchasing and sales plans and business operations of state-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives must fully consider all aspects of farmers' economic life and comprehensively arrange the entire rural market, otherwise it will not be possible to meet the production and living needs of farmers.
　　Thirdly, the connection between rural private merchants and farmers and with urban capitalist industry and commerce has been greatly weakened, and their position is becoming increasingly isolated and declining. However, because the vast rural areas are extremely scattered, socialist commerce will not be able to completely replace rural private merchants and peddlers for a considerable period of time, and it is still necessary to make good use of them to participate in expanding commodity circulation and developing urban-rural exchange. At the same time, the state must also arrange and take care of the lives of the vast number of rural private merchants and peddlers (estimated to be more than 10 million including family members). Therefore, state-owned commercial enterprises, especially cooperative commercial enterprises, should shoulder the responsibility for arranging and transforming rural private merchants and peddlers.
　　These three tasks are closely related. If any one aspect of the work is not done well, it will be enough to hinder urban-rural exchange, affect people's lives and industrial and agricultural production. The responsibility is extremely heavy.
　　4. The seasonality of the market is becoming more intense, posing a series of new problems for the work of various relevant departments.
　　Due to the implementation of unified purchase of grain, oil, and cotton, and in order to control the source of major industrial raw materials and export materials, state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperative commercial enterprises have strengthened the purchase of tobacco leaves, sugar materials, hemp, tea, silk, fur, etc., and have adopted the method of raising the base purchase price and eliminating seasonal price differences in pricing policies to stimulate farmers to sell early. Therefore, the season for the listing and purchase of agricultural products is extremely concentrated. In general, the annual purchase plan must be basically completed within two or three months after the harvest.
　　At this time, on the one hand, the state needs to invest a large amount of currency for purchase. On the other hand, after farmers receive a large amount of income, they need to purchase. Therefore, the rural market presents an unusual prosperity and tension. Various business departments are carrying out the purchase, storage, processing, and transportation of agricultural products in a tense manner, and at the same time, they must carry out sales in a tense manner to withdraw the large amount of currency that has been put into circulation. During this period, if any aspect of the work lags behind the requirements of the objective situation, it will cause major losses and confusion.
　　When new cotton was listed and unified purchase began in 1954, many state-owned companies and cooperatives in cotton-producing areas failed to foresee the concentration and tension of the work in the cotton listing and purchase season. They failed to adapt to the requirements of the objective situation in terms of purchase bases, personnel allocation, storage, processing, transportation, and capital preparation. As a result, a contradictory phenomenon of "failing to complete the purchase plan on the one hand, and failing to meet the farmers' sales requirements on the other hand" was formed. In addition, many areas that implemented unified purchase of grain and oil formed a chaotic phenomenon of "overstocking at the top and out of stock at the bottom" because the work of material supply failed to keep pace in a timely manner. These are very important lessons.
　　The new situation of increasingly strong seasonality in the rural market has raised many new problems for our purchase and supply work. In addition, it has also brought out some other problems, such as:
　　How to rationally arrange the business of private merchants in the peak and off seasons?
　　When concentrating efforts to purchase major agricultural products, how to take into account the regular purchase of local products?
　　How to guide farmers to correctly allocate the concentrated large amount of income to reasonable uses and regular expenses?
　　All of these are new problems under the new situation that require various relevant departments to study and solve as soon as possible.
　　5. The rural mutual aid and cooperation movement is developing vigorously, and the number of organized farmers is increasing day by day. Many farmers buy and sell things collectively. Mutual aid teams and production cooperatives have signed long-term supply and marketing contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives, strengthening the organization and planning of the rural market. At the same time, after the unified purchase and sale, many new types of markets have emerged in rural areas - such as the national grain market. These also have extremely important implications for the future development of the rural market.
　　In addition, the commodity supply in the rural market has also undergone tremendous changes in terms of variety and specifications. Farmers' income has increased and become more concentrated than before. At the same time, the large-scale development of "organized" mutual aid teams and production cooperatives has made it possible to purchase more new-style farm tools. Small livestock are required to be replaced by large livestock (cattle and donkeys are replaced by mules and horses, etc.). Means of livelihood also require higher quality, and new varieties are required to be increased, such as serge, gabardine, fruit candy, yarn, children's toys, knitwear, bicycles, leather clothing, etc. This is also a new situation that needs to be paid attention to by various supply departments and production departments as soon as possible.
　　Several Issues That Need to Be Resolved in the Rural Market in the Future
　　Based on the above-mentioned development and changes in the rural market in terms of material supply, urban-rural relations, public-private relations, seasonal changes, and the expansion of its impact on farmers' economic lives, the following major issues need to be resolved in the rural market in the future:
　　1. Fully estimate the rapid growth of farmers' purchasing power, understand farmers' needs, and further improve rural supply work.
　　Over the past year since the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain and oil, we have achieved tremendous achievements in ensuring the supply of cities, industrial and mining areas, and export needs, and have gained preliminary experience. However, we have not yet had time to find a more complete and proper way to deal with the rural supply and market arrangements that have undergone tremendous changes after the unified purchase and sale. The work in this area needs to be strengthened urgently.
　　In 1954, many places overstocked goods suitable for sale in rural areas in cities. At the same time, they lacked investigation and research on farmers' needs, and even lacked sufficient understanding of the important significance of rural supply, and were very unconcerned about farmers' needs. This situation is extremely incompatible with the rapid growth of farmers' purchasing power, the rapid development of "supply falling short of demand" in rural areas, and the increasingly important situation of the rural market. Some cadres of state-owned companies and cooperatives also believe that since "supply falling short of demand" is the general trend, it is impossible to fully meet everyone's needs anyway, then they can operate passively, resulting in conservative hoarding and a bureaucratic attitude of irresponsibility to the people, losing the active direction and goals of business operations. They have not realized that precisely because supply falls short of demand, they should better understand the needs of the people in all aspects, actively organize various sources of goods as much as possible, strengthen promotion, and try to alleviate the degree of supply falling short of demand and better serve the people. The idea of conservative hoarding can only further increase the pressure of supply falling short of demand and cause market confusion. They have also not recognized that precisely because of the growth of social purchasing power, it will put increasingly higher demands on industrial and agricultural production, promoting the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production. In this situation, commercial workers have a greater responsibility to serve production and serve the people, and their tasks are more important and more glorious.
　　Because the purchase of agricultural products is extremely important to national industrialization, it is necessary to vigorously strengthen the supply to rural areas in order to meet the needs of farmers and facilitate the purchase of agricultural products. In the future, industrial products needed by both urban and rural areas should be supplied to rural areas first. At the same time, under the trend of supply falling short of demand for many commodities, in addition to increasing the production of means of production and means of livelihood needed by farmers, we should also strengthen the work of guiding farmers' consumption in order to increase the amount of commodities that can be supplied. For example, recently, the Qinghai Provincial Trading Company demonstrated the use and performance of meat grinders to Tibetan compatriots, and sold out a large number of meat grinders that had been overstocked for several years in a few days. They also helped Tibetan people learn how to use radio receivers, promoted the sales of a large number of radios, and recovered a large amount of currency. This is a very good example. For many commodities that are in short supply, we should also actively find substitutes. For example, if there is insufficient lamp oil and cart oil, we can organize farmers to collect wild oil-containing seeds and kernels to extract oil. If there are insufficient beans for making vermicelli, we can replace them with potato flour and sweet potato flour. If there is insufficient pig feed, we can feed the pigs with oil cakes for fertilizing the fields first, and then use the pig manure to fertilize the fields, etc. Today, the commodities that are in short supply still account for a small number. We still have endless potential to tap, and it is entirely possible to further improve the work of rural supply.
　　2. The purchase of agricultural products should be combined with arranging the needs of rural areas and guiding farmers' production, and strengthening the organizational work of rural economic life.
　　Experience over the past year has proven that unified purchase must be combined with unified sale, and purchase must be combined with supply. If unified purchase and unified sale, purchase and supply are completely separated, it will lead to market confusion and a passive working situation. Moreover, while doing a good job in unified purchase and sale, we must also do a lot of economic and political work to arrange the economic lives of the vast number of farmers after the unified purchase and sale. Among them, it is particularly important to guide farmers to conduct adjustment transactions in addition to the unified purchase and sale of grain to supplement the deficiencies of the unified purchase and sale and revitalize the rural economy. Facts have proven that in places where the work of guiding farmers to conduct adjustment transactions is done well, there is no difficulty in grain and oil, and the burden of state supply can be reduced. In places where this work is not done well, to varying degrees, there will be a failure to meet the needs of farmers, and a stagnation of certain aspects of the rural economy.
　　After the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain and oil, the commodity distribution relationship of grain and oil has changed abruptly. Some areas did not have time to make perfect arrangements, causing some difficulties in the supply of raw materials for folk sideline industry workshops (oil mills, flour mills, tofu workshops, etc.) and the cooked food industry. Some were forced to temporarily close down, which affected the supply to farmers. Now that the work of unified purchase and sale of grain and oil has laid a foundation, all localities should immediately start to plan and adjust the production of oil mills, flour mills, tofu workshops, etc., to appropriately meet the needs of farmers. Management and leadership should also be strengthened for the rural cooked food industry to ensure that travelers everywhere can get convenient supplies.
　　Most rural areas have not had time to implement planned supply of edible oil. Many places have adopted methods such as "limiting the amount but not the number of times" and "purchasing with membership certificates," supplying regardless of whether there is oil or not, resulting in uneven distribution of hardship and happiness and serious waste, making it difficult for some oil-deficient farmers to eat and use oil. In the future, in addition to mobilizing farmers to increase the production of oil crops, we should also strengthen the planning and organization of edible oil supply in rural areas, change the current supply method, which is basically still free-flowing in many places, and ensure that oil-deficient households can get the necessary supply.
　　A comprehensive arrangement must also be made for meat and other agricultural and sideline products. On the one hand, we must resolutely guarantee the task of supplying cities, industrial and mining areas, and export needs. On the other hand, we must also combine it with arranging the necessary consumption in rural areas. Only with this comprehensive and overall consideration can we smoothly realize the state's plan. For example, in the past, when Heilongjiang Province purchased live pigs, it did not combine it with arranging rural consumption. Farmers slaughtered and ate themselves in a scattered manner, wasting a large number of pigs, making it impossible to complete the purchase plan. Later, the consumption of farmers was organized and arranged, reducing unplanned self-slaughter, and as a result, the purchase task was overfulfilled. This experience is very good and worthy of emulation by all localities.
　　In order to meet the increasing needs, it is also very important to further organize and guide agricultural production. For example, for cash crops, we can implement a pre-purchase method to help farmers formulate production plans and solve the difficulties in their production process in order to increase production and expand purchases. For hairy pigs, we can widely organize farmers to raise them according to needs and possibilities, and implement methods such as "assigning purchase" and "assigning raising" to increase the source of pigs. The purchase of agricultural products should be further combined with the supply of industrial products.
　　3. Properly arrange rural private merchants and peddlers, rectify the rural commercial network, and improve the channels of urban-rural exchange.
　　Because some cadres of state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives neglected the arrangement of private merchants and peddlers in the course of their advance, many urban-rural transportation merchants and rural private merchants and peddlers have experienced operating difficulties and business closures, disrupting some channels of urban-rural exchange and the veins of the rural commercial network. This has caused some blockages in urban-rural exchange. Moreover, many farmers have to travel dozens of miles to buy and sell a little something, and often have to queue for a long time. This situation needs to be improved.
　　While transforming and arranging rural private merchants and peddlers, state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperative commercial enterprises in various localities should combine the work of rectifying the rural commercial network, reasonably arrange the commercial network in rural areas according to the requirements of economic development (attention should be paid to organizing and utilizing peddlers), and facilitate farmers' buying and selling. Urban-rural transportation merchants who are still needed now should also be organized and utilized to enrich the channels of urban-rural exchange, expand material exchange, and revitalize the urban and rural economy.
　　At present, the sales prices of supply and marketing cooperatives in many primary markets are too low (generally 3% to 5% lower than the retail prices of local state-owned companies), and some are even lower than in cities, affecting the operating difficulties of rural private merchants and peddlers and urban-rural transportation merchants. In many places, there are no appropriate regional price differences between urban and rural areas and the phenomenon of inverted urban-rural prices, which violates the normal laws of material circulation. Therefore, it also affects the role of many cities as economic centers in the past. This is also not conducive to expanding material exchange and revitalizing the urban and rural economy. In the future, we should further adjust and improve urban-rural commercial relations in terms of pricing policies in accordance with the laws of material circulation and the needs of the state plan.
　　In terms of market management, since the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain and oil, some areas have gradually appeared to independently establish unified purchase and sale titles, affecting the legitimate operations of private merchants and peddlers. The implementation of regional blockades on commodity circulation, as well as overly strict restrictions on the reasonable self-production and self-sale of farmers' native and sideline products, hinders material exchange and affects people's lives. This practice urgently needs to be corrected and improved. The behavior of some private merchants who raise prices to purchase agricultural products and compete with state-owned companies and cooperatives for the market, and the behavior of some farmers who combine with private merchants to undermine the state's purchase plan must also be strictly prohibited.
　　4. Strengthen the publicity and education on the economic life issues of farmers themselves, and mobilize farmers to participate in the national industrialization construction with more conscious and powerful efforts.
　　Unified purchase and sale is an important measure to ensure the smooth progress of national industrialization construction, protect the interests of the vast number of urban and rural consumers and the vast number of agricultural producers. Over the past year, it has been supported by the people of the whole country. In particular, farmers have enthusiastically responded to the state's planned purchase call, and the national purchase plan for grain and oil has been overfulfilled. However, planned purchase and planned supply have strong contradictions with the habits of farmers' small-scale producers. With the expansion of the scope of planned purchase and planned supply, and the development of the trend of supply falling short of demand for many commodities in the rural market, this resistance of farmers will increase to some extent, which is completely understandable. Therefore, it is urgent to strengthen the publicity and education work on the economic life issues of farmers themselves, improve farmers' socialist awareness, and mobilize farmers to participate in the national industrialization construction with more conscious and powerful efforts. This is an important key to the current rural work.
　　In the 1954 grain purchase work, various localities used the slogans of supporting national industrialization, supporting the liberation of Taiwan, and supporting the compatriots in the disaster areas, combined with the development of production and the improvement of living standards of local farmers since liberation, the painful memories of suffering from floods, wives and children being separated, and wandering around during the Kuomintang rule, and the personal experience of suffering from the brutal oppression of Japanese imperialists to mobilize farmers to sell surplus grain, which achieved significant results. Farmers not only actively sold surplus grain, but also further improved their awareness. This experience is worth continuing to promote. However, some areas did not carry out meticulous publicity and education work, or only publicized a few empty slogans divorced from the personal experience of the masses, and some even simply forced orders, and as a result, it was difficult to complete the purchase plan and many chaotic phenomena were produced.
　　In addition to strengthening education, the commercial departments that play an important role in people's economic life should better study the needs of urban and rural residents, actively organize sources of goods, expand urban-rural exchange, and meet the requirements of the vast number of people. "However, the work of our commercial departments has not been able to fully adapt to this huge change in the domestic market, so some passivity is inevitable in our work." ("Zhou Enlai: Government Work Report") How to overcome this shortcoming is a major economic and political task related to the vital interests of the vast number of urban and rural people!

    粮食、油料统购统销和大力开展农村互助合作运动以来，农村市场（包括与农村经济有直接联系的县城初级市场——下同）发生了若干重要的变化。河南省太康县召开的县、区、乡三级干部会议上，各小组总结一年来本乡、本村里“多了些什么，少了些什么”？一致得出的结论是，一年来全县有十大增加：
    一、农业生产合作社及互助组增加。组织起来的农户，一九五三年占总户数百分之二十四，一九五四年增加到百分之四十五。
    二、供销合作社营业增加。一九五四年各区供销合作社的业务约比一九五三年扩大两倍。
    三、信用合作社增加。一九五三年有八个社，一九五四年发展到一百○六个社，现在百分之七十的乡已有信用社。许多信用社已能完全负担起本乡农民的信贷工作，有的社存款还贷放不完。
    四、干部与群众的社会主义觉悟提高。大批互助组纷纷要求转成生产合作社。
    五、积极分子增加。一九五四年夏粮统购超额完成了任务，并出现模范乡三十七个及售粮模范二千八百五十五人。
    六、生产劲头增加。一九五四年全县新添粪池九千五百五十个，厕所二千四百○二个，新猪圈一千二百九十六个，农民积极积肥增产。
    七、骡马增加。仅各乡信用合作社贷款组织农民购买的牲口就有两千多头。
    八、大件农具、新式农具及大车增加。新添新式农具和大件农具五千四百四十九件，大车一千六百二十六辆。
    九、新瓦房增加。一九五四年全县新盖瓦房一万四千三百七十六间。
    十、穿新衣服的增加。县花纱布公司一九五四年一、二、三季度销布额比一九五三年同期增加了七点二八倍。
    还有五大减少：
  　一、买卖土地减少。一九五三年全县买卖土地者五千八百○三户，计一万四千六百九十四亩，一九五四年减为九百五十九户，二千七百一十四亩。
    二、囤粮户减少。一九五三年有一千一百七十六户囤粮，一九五四年只有四十八户了。
    三、雇工减少。一九五三年全县雇工者八百五十六户，一九五四年减为五百七十户。
    四、出租土地的减少。一九五三年有二千二百六十二户出租土地，一九五四年减少到一千九百六十五户。
    五、投机商贩减少。一年来市场物价比以往任何时候都平稳。
    其它地区也同样有类似情形出现。如河南陕县薛店乡农民说，统购统销带来了“七多、四快、三少”；七多是：牲口多，农具多，水车浇地多，用肥料多，生产社多，信用社多，新房子多。四快是：化学肥料销售快、建筑材料销售快、脚车车轴销售快、棉布销售快。三少是：高利贷少，买卖土地少，二流子懒汉少。
    农村生活的变化，正像许多农民所称颂的：“生产增加、物价稳定，晚上能睡安宁觉，白天不操心”。即在灾区，受灾农民在党与政府的领导下，普遍掀起“生产自救，重建家园”的热潮，灾民感激地说：“只有毛主席、共产党，才能把秋天变成春天！”生产、生活的恢复也是很快的。
    这些，可以说是当前全国农村“欣欣向荣”情况的一个比较完整的缩影。它不仅生动地描绘出广大农村生产提高，生活改善的鲜明轮廓，并且有力地说明了千千万万的农民是朝着总路线所指示的方向大踏步地前进的。农村经济生活中，社会主义的因素日益增长，资本主义因素日趋没落。一句话，当前农村的基本情况，即是党的政策在农村中的巨大成就。
    农村市场情况的若干重要变化
    随着总路线的宣传贯彻，粮食、油料统购统销，及农村经济生活的发展变化，农村市场出现了许多新的情况与问题。如：
    一、农民购买力突出增长，农村市场“供不应求”现象迅速发展。
    这是因为：
      （一）总路线的宣传、贯彻和粮食、油料实行统购统销，使许多农民把原来束缚在捣生意、囤粮、雇工、买地、放债等方面的巨大财力解放出来，转移为正常的对生产资料和生活资料的购买力了。例如，太康县在宣传、贯彻总路线和实行粮食、油料统购统销以前，由于私商与富农的投机活动，粮价不断上涨，一九五三年青黄不接时，麦子市价涨到二千四百元一斤（牌价八百元），粮食公司每天抛售几十万斤粮食还是打击不了黑市，后来连红薯也涨到一千四百元一斤，使得贫困农民有的不得不卖地买口粮，大家都不能安心过日子、搞生产，当时牲畜价下掉二分之一还很少有人要，木料、砖瓦、家具等都猛烈掉价，甚至连原来畅销的油饼，这时也要赊销才有人要。而在一九五三年十月实行粮食统购统销后，粮价一直稳定，也没法再囤粮、投机了，“买牲口不如买地，买地不如放债，放债不如囤粮”的想法迅速消失，“不务正的人都务正了”，大家都能安心过日子，搞生产。一九五四年一至三季度，供销合作社销了三万四千五百五十七把麦铲，而一九五三年全年只销了两万○七百五十三把，还要赊销；一九五四年一至三季度销了扫帚（扫场用）五万四千五百八十三把，而一九五三年全年只销了两万○九百五十三把，也还是赊销的。生活资料的消费也比统购统销前显著增长，一九五四年一至三季度和一九五三年同期相比，县百货商店销售的玻璃增加了一点三倍，自行车增加四点六倍，袜子增加两倍，卫生衫增加四点六倍，被单增加八倍，颜料增加十倍，煤油增加了五点二倍。
      （二）农民出售的产品比统购统销以前多了。如粮食，过去农民一般是“为买而卖”，需用钱的时候才卖一些。现在则除按统购标准留自用部分
  （口粮、饲料、种子、机动粮）以外，几乎全数出售给国家了。粮食浪费的现象也大大减少。又因国家进入大规模经济建设后，交通日益发展，城市、工矿区及出口的需要日增，农村土、副产品的销路扩大，也增加农民不少收入。
      （三）宣传贯彻总路线及实行统购统销后，农民买卖绝大多数经过供销合作社，大大减免了商人的中间剥削，出卖的东西所得增多，买进的东西比以前便宜。据福建省财政经济委员会调查，统购统销后，南平县许多乡村干部（都是不脱离生产的农民）的家庭，一年来因为减免了商人的中间剥削和参加互助合作等，所得到的利益，每家达五十万元左右。全国五万万农民买卖之间减免了的中间剥削及得到国家给予的利益为数是可观的，这样也就大大提高了农民的购买力。
    其它如一年来农村信用合作社大量发展，使许多农民减免了高利贷的盘剥；农业生产合作社发展，产量一般提高百分之十五；许多地方兴建巨大的工业、交通、水利工程，吸收了大批农民参加工作，并使许多农村“连石子、沙土都变成钱了！”所有这些，无不增加了农民的收入。
    由于以上各项原因，使广大农民的购买力在恢复时期原已普遍提高的基础上更加迅速地增长起来。据中南各省财委副主任会议初步估算，中南地区一九五四年虽遭受百年未有的大水灾，但一九五四年全区农民购买力仍不低于一九五三年，并还稍有增长。其它非灾区农民购买力上升的情况也就可想而知了。
    这种情况迫使农村市场商品供不应求现象很快发展。例如，一九五三年以前，百货在农村中销售得并不畅快，但一九五四年却开始出现紧张局面，许多百货商品相当普遍地脱销。
    二、城乡交流的渠道发生巨大变化；农村市场在国内商业中的比重扩大。
    由于粮食、油料、棉布等实行统购统销，国营商业和合作社商业基本上掌握了工、农业产品的货源，并在全国范围内实行从产地到销地的长距离的直线调拨，减少了物资流转的层次，大大削弱了城乡资本主义的联系，农民买卖东西绝大部分经过当地国营公司或合作社了，农村市场的私商也从过去依靠城市批发商进货而转向当地国营公司、合作社进货，因而农村市场在国内商业中的地位日见重要起来，而城市（除少数新兴的工业城市外）商业则有下降的趋势。据江苏省财政经济委员会统计，一九五三年第四季度全省农村货币回笼占城乡货币投放总额百分之三十八点五二，一九五四年第四季度农村货币回笼预计将达全省城乡货币投放总额的百分之六十点二一。城乡货币流通情况这种显著的变化，说明城乡市场在国内商业中的地位已发生了巨大的变化。
    如果不了解城乡市场关系已发生如此重大的变化，不去相应地改变原来城乡商业工作的部署，那么，就会出现“城市积压，农村脱销”以及“某些大、中城市商业过剩，而农村商业工作赶不上客观形势发展的要求”等等不能满足农民需要与妨碍城乡交流的情况，也就会使我们的工作陷于被动与不利的局面。
      在城乡市场关系如此剧烈转变的情况下，许多地方产生了“城乡物资交流是否畅通”的争论。一种人看到城市商业下降，市场情况不如以前活跃，说这就是“城乡交流不畅”、“城乡关系阻塞”的结果；另一种人见到农村市场营业额大有增加，就肯定“城乡交流畅通无阻”，说“城乡交流不畅”这种看法完全是“无中生有”，根本没有什么根据。这个争论，对今天的商业工作来说，倒是极有教益的。因为，前一种人没有认识到：今天国营商业及合作社商业已遍布全国城乡，同时又已基本上掌握了主要的工农产品的货源，在这样的条件下，不可能产生范围较广或带根本性质的“城乡交流不畅”及“城乡关系阻塞”的形势。而后一种人则没有认识到：由于我国地区辽阔，经济发展又很不平衡，在城乡商业关系如此急骤变化的情况下，虽然国营商业和合作社已遍布全国，并已掌握了主要工农产品的货源，但如果没有很好去利用原有的城乡交流的渠道，或没有按照经济发展的要求，相应地扩展商品流转，那么也完全有可能会发生某些物资或某些地区性的城乡交流不畅与阻塞现象。当前城乡商业关系的实际情况是：基本畅通，而某些物资或局部地区存在阻塞、不通现象。例如，国营商业与合作社对农村需要的许多小百货及城市和出口需要的许多小土产没有很好经营，又没有充分利用私商、小贩去贩运，因此形成这些物资的“城乡脱节”现象。还有不少次要的，甚至是主要的商品，由于国营商业和合作社本身工作上的缺点和没有很好利用原有的城乡交流的渠道，以致也不断发生某些地区、某些时候和某些品种的“脱节”现象，不能很好满足人民的要求。
    农村市场在国内商业中的比重扩大了。这种形势的变化，不仅商业工作需要及时赶上去，其它交通、银行、税收等部门也应迅速加强农村市场的工作，不然就会造成损失与被动。
    三、农民经济生活进一步纳入国家计划轨道，自由市场迅速缩小，大大加重了社会主义商业对农村市场的责任。
    农村市场的以上变化，一方面为进一步把农村经济纳入国家计划轨道，更好地改善农民生活与扩大城乡交流，以及便利国家对农业、手工业和农村私商进行社会主义改造创造了有利的条件；另一方面也加重了社会主义的国营商业和合作社商业对农村市场的责任。
    首先，原来的城乡商业渠道已在新的形势下发生巨大变化，社会主义商业必须迅速整顿与健全新的城乡商业关系，对农村商业网也须迅速加以充实和安排，以进一步扩大城乡交流和农村中的商品流转。
    其次，农民经济生活与自由市场的联系大大削弱以后，农民卖的东西和买的东西大部都经过供销合作社了，今后国营商业和供销合作社的购销计划和业务经营，必须全面考虑到农民经济生活的各个方面，并全面安排整个农村市场，不然就不能满足农民生产、生活上的需要。
    第三、农村市场的私商与农民以及与城市资本主义工商业的联系已经大大削弱，地位日趋孤立与衰落；但因为广大农村极为分散，社会主义商业在相当长的一个时期内还不可能完全代替农村的私商、小贩，还需要很好利用他们参加扩大商品流转与发展城乡交流的工作；同时，国家对为数庞大的（估计连家属约有一千多万人）农村私商小贩的生活也必须要安排照顾，因此，国营商业、特别是合作社商业应该负担起农村私商、小贩的安排与改造的责任。
    这三方面的任务是紧密关联着的，任何一个方面的工作做不好，都足以妨碍到城乡交流，影响人民生活与工农业生产，责任是极其繁重的。
    四、市场的季节性更加强烈，对各有关部门的工作提出了一系列的新问题。
    由于粮食、油料、棉花实行统购，同时国营商业、合作社商业为掌握主要工业原料及出口物资的货源，加强了对烟叶、糖料、麻、茶叶、蚕丝、皮毛等收购工作，又在价格政策上采取提高收购基价、取消季节差价的办法，刺激农民早卖，于是农产品的上市与收购季节极为集中，一般在收获后的两三个月内，基本上就要完成全年的收购计划。
    这时，一方面国家需要大量投放货币进行收购。另一方面，农民得到了大量的收入后，又需要购买，因此农村市场就呈现异常的兴旺与紧张。各个业务部门紧张地进行农产品的收购、保管、加工、调运等工作，同时又要紧张地进行销售，以回笼投放出去的大量货币；在这期间，任何一方面工作如落后于客观形势的要求，就会造成重大的损失和混乱。
    一九五四年新棉上市开始统购时，许多棉产区的国营公司与合作社由于没有能预见到棉花上市与收购季节工作的集中、紧张性，在收购据点、人员配备、保管、加工、调运以及资金准备等各方面都未能适应客观形势的要求，结果形成“一方面完不成收购计划，另方面又满足不了农民出售要求”的矛盾现象；又有许多实行粮食、油料统购的地区，由于物资供应工作没有能及时配合上，形成“上面积压，下面脱销”的混乱现象。这些都是很重要的经验教训。
    农村市场季节性更趋强烈的新情况，对我们的收购、供应工作提出了许多新的问题，此外，还随带出一些其它的问题，如：
    对私商淡旺季的营业，如何合理的安排？
    在集中力量收购主要农产品的时候，如何兼顾经常性的土产收购工作？
    如何指导农民将集中的大量收入，正确地分配于合理的用途和经常性的支出？
    诸如此类，都是新情况下的新问题，需要各有关部门及早研究解决。
    五、农村互助合作运动蓬勃发展，组织起来的农民日益增加，许多农民买、卖东西都是集体地进行了，互助组及生产合作社并与供销合作社订立了长期的供销合同，加强了农村市场的组织性与计划性。同时，统购统销后，农村中又出现了许多新型的市场——如国家粮食市场，这些，对今后农村市场的发展，也有极其重要的影响。
    此外，农村市场的商品供应，在品种、规格各方面也发生了巨大变化。农民的收入比以前增加并集中了，同时“组织起来”的互助组和生产合作社大量发展，因此，就有可能购买更多的新式农具，小牲口要求换成大牲口（牛、驴换骡、马等），生活资料也要求质量更高的，并要求增加供应新的品种，如哔叽、华达呢、水果糖、毛线、儿童玩具、针织品、自行车、皮衣等，这也是需要各供应部门和生产部门及早注意的一个新的形势。
    今后农村市场需要解决的几个问题
  　根据上述农村市场在物资供应、城乡关系、公私关系、季节变化以及对农民的经济生活影响扩大等方面的发展变化，今后农村市场需要解决下面几个主要问题：
    一、充分估计农民购买力迅速增长的情况，了解农民的需要，进一步做好农村供应工作。
    粮食、油料实行统购统销一年来，我们对保证城市、工矿区供应及出口的需要方面，已经获得巨大的成就，并取得了初步的经验。但是，对统购统销后发生了巨大变化的农村供应和市场安排等工作，还没有来得及找出一套比较完整、妥善的办法来，这方面的工作亟待加强。
    一九五四年，许多地方把适销农村的货物积压在城市，同时对农民的需要缺乏调查研究，甚至对农村供应的重要意义也认识不足，对农民的需要很不关心，这种情况与农民购买力迅速增长、农村
  “供不应求”迅速发展及农村市场日见重要的形势是极不相称的。还有部分国营公司及合作社干部认为，既然“供不应求”是总的趋向，横竖不能充分满足每个人的需要，那么就可以消极地经营了，产生保守惜售思想及对人民不负责任的官僚主义态度，对业务经营失去积极的方向和目标。他们没有认识：正是因为供不应求，就应更好地去了解人民各方面的需要，尽一切可能积极组织各种各样的货源，加强推销，去设法减轻供不应求的程度，更好地为人民服务；而保守惜售思想适足以更加重供不应求的压力，并造成市场混乱。他们也没有认清，正是因为社会购买力的增长，才会向工、农业生产提出日益增高的要求，推动着工、农业生产迅速向前发展，商业工作者在这样情况下，更加加重了为生产服务、为人民服务的责任，任务是更加重大、更加光荣了。
    由于农产品的收购对国家工业化有极其重要的意义，因此，必须大力加强对农村的供应，以满足农民的需要、便利农产品的收购。今后，凡城乡都需要的工业品，应尽先供应农村，同时，在许多商品供不应求的趋势下，除增加生产农民所需要的生产、生活资料外，还应加强指导农民消费的工作，以增加可能供应的商品量，如最近青海省贸易公司向藏民同胞表演了绞肉机的使用方法和性能，不几天就把几年来积压的大批绞肉机销售一空，又帮助藏民学会使用无线电收音机的方法，推销了大批收音机，回收了大量货币，就是很好的例子。对许多供不应求的商品，还应积极设法寻找代用品，如点灯油、捁车油不足，可组织农民采集野生的含油籽仁榨取；做粉条的豆子不足，可以土豆粉、红薯粉代替；猪饲料不足，可把肥田的油饼先喂猪，然后再用猪粪来肥田等等。今天供不应求的商品究竟还占少数，我们还有无穷无尽的潜力可以挖掘，完全有可能进一步做好农村供应工作。
    二、对农产品收购要与安排农村的需要及指导农民生产相结合，并加强对农村经济生活的组织工作。
    一年来的经验证明，统购必须与统销、收购必须与供应很好地结合进行；如果把统购与统销、收购与供应截然分裂，就会产生市场混乱与工作被动局面。而且在做好统购统销工作的同时，还必须做许多经济、政治工作来安排统购统销后广大农民的经济生活。其中特别重要的是要在粮食的统购统销以外，指导农民进行调剂性的交易，以补助统购统销的不足、活跃农村经济。事实证明，凡是做好指导农民进行调剂性交易的地方，粮食、油料就不感到有什么困难，并能减少国家供应的负担；凡是没有做好这一工作的地方，就程度不同地产生不能满足农民需要，并出现农村经济某些呆滞的局面。
    粮食、油料实行统购统销后，粮、油的商品分配关系骤然改变，某些地区一时没有能来得及尽善安排，致使民间原有的副食业作坊（油坊、粉坊、豆腐坊等）及熟食业的原料供应发生若干困难，有的被迫一时停业，对农民的供应就受到影响。现在粮食、油料的统购统销工作已打下基础，各地应即着手有计划地调整油坊、粉坊、豆腐坊等的生产，适当满足农民的需要；对农村熟食业也应加强管理领导，务使各地往来行人都能得到便利的供应。
    食油，多数农村还没有来得及实行计划供应，许多地方采取“限量不限次”，“凭社员证购买”等不管有油没油一律供应的办法，形成苦乐不均与严重浪费，使得部分缺油农民吃油、用油发生困难。今后除一面动员农民增加油料作物生产以外，一面还应加强农村食油供应的计划性与组织性，改变目前许多地方基本上还是自流的供应方法，保证缺油户能得到必要的供应。
    对于肉食及其它农副产品，也须作全面的安排，一面坚决保证城市、工矿区供应及出口需要的任务，一面还须结合着安排农村的必要消费。只有这样全面统筹兼顾的办法，才能顺利实现国家的计划。例如黑龙江省以前收购生猪时，没有结合安排农村的消费，农民分散地自宰自食，浪费了大量的猪，使收购计划完不成。后将农民的消费加以组织、安排，减少了无计划的自宰，结果就超额完成了收购任务。这个经验很好，值得各地仿行。
    为满足日益增加的需要，进一步组织与指导农业生产也是很重要的，如对经济作物，可实行预购办法，帮助农民订定生产计划，解决其生产过程中的困难，以增加生产、扩大收购。对毛猪可视需要与可能，广泛组织农民饲养，实行“派购”“派养”等办法，以增加猪源。收购农产品要与供应工业品进一步结合起来。
    三、妥善安排农村私商、小贩，整顿农村商业网，健全城乡交流的渠道。
    由于部分国营商业与合作社的干部在前进时忽视了对私商、小贩的安排，致使许多城乡贩运商及农村私商、小贩发生经营困难与歇业现象，打乱了一些城乡交流渠道与农村商业网的脉络，这样就造成了城乡交流中的某些阻塞现象。而且使许多农民买卖一点东西要往返走几十里路，并往往要排很长时间的队，这种情况是需要改进的。
    与改造、安排农村私商、小贩的同时，各地国营商业和合作社商业应结合进行整顿农村商业网的工作，按照经济发展的要求，合理布置农村中的商业网，（应注意组织、利用货郎担）便利农民买卖。对现在还需要的城乡贩运商，亦要组织利用，以充实城乡交流的渠道，扩大物资交流，活跃城乡经济。
    目前，许多初级市场供销合作社的销售价格偏低（一般比当地国营公司零售价还低百分之三至五）有的甚至比城市还低，影响农村私商小贩及城乡贩运商经营困难；许多地方城乡之间没有适当的地区差价及城乡价格倒挂现象，违背了正常的物资流转的规律，因而也影响了原来许多城市作为经济中心的作用，这对扩大物资交流、活跃城乡经济也是不利的。今后应按照物资流转的规律及国家计划的需要，在价格政策等方面，进一步调整、改进城乡商业关系。
    在市场管理方面，自粮食、油料实行统购统销后，部分地区逐渐出现自立统购统销名目，影响私商、小贩的合法经营；对商品流通实行区域封锁，以及对农民土、副产品合理的自产自销限制过严等现象，妨碍物资交流，影响人民生活，这种做法亟需纠正改进。还有部分私商抬价收购农产品，与国营公司、合作社争夺市场，及某些农民与私商结合，破坏国家收购计划的行为，也必须严格制止。
    四、加强对农民切身经济生活问题的宣传教育，动员农民更自觉、有力地参加国家工业化建设事业。
    统购统销是保证国家工业化建设顺利进行、保障广大城乡消费者及广大农业生产者的利益的重要措施，一年来得到全国人民的赞助，特别是农民热烈地响应了国家计划收购的号召，使粮食、油料都超额完成了国家收购计划。但是，计划收购与计划供应与农民小生产者的习惯势力是存在着强烈的矛盾的。随着计划收购、计划供应范围的扩大，以及农村市场许多商品供不应求趋势的发展，农民的这种抵触情绪还会有所增长，这是完全可以理解的。因此急需加强对农民切身经济生活问题的宣传教育工作，提高农民的社会主义觉悟，动员农民更自觉、有力地参加国家工业化建设事业。这是当前农村工作的一个重要关键。
    一九五四年粮食统购工作中，各地用支援国家工业化、支援解放台湾、支援灾区同胞的口号，结合当地农民解放以来生产发展、生活改善的情况；国民党统治时期遭受水灾、妻离子散、颠沛流离的痛苦回忆；以及身受日本帝国主义者残暴压迫等切身经验，动员农民卖余粮，收到了显著的效果。农民不但踊跃出卖余粮，而且进一步提高了觉悟程度，这个经验是值得继续发扬的。但也有部分地区不去进行细致的宣传教育工作，或只是脱离群众切身经验，宣传几句空泛的口号，有的甚至简单地强迫命令行事，结果就很难完成收购计划，并产生了不少混乱现象。
    除了加强教育以外，在人民经济生活中起重要作用的商业工作部门，则应更好地研究城乡居民的需要，积极组织货源，扩大城乡交流，满足广大人民的要求。“但是，我们的商业部门的工作还没有能够同国内市场这一巨大的变化完全适应，因此在工作中不免有些被动”。（“周恩来：政府工作报告”）如何克服这个缺点，是目前关系广大城乡人民群众切身利益的一项重大的经济和政治任务！
