The session also elected Wang Feiran as President of the Beijing Higher People's Court and He Zhanjun as President of the Intermediate People's Court.

    During the session, the representatives reviewed and discussed the reports made by Yan Jingqing, Director of the Beijing Municipal Public Health Bureau, and Yang Yimin, Deputy Director of the Agriculture and Forestry Bureau, respectively, on improving health work in Beijing and developing agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement in the suburbs of Beijing.

    In his report, Yan Jingqing pointed out that through the Patriotic Health Campaign, the environmental and personal hygiene conditions in the capital have been greatly improved. The number of municipal health institutions has increased from 19 in 1949 to 128, and the number of hospital beds has increased from 537 to 3,535. The health work of factory and mine workers has been preliminarily strengthened. According to statistics from six large factories, from January to October 1954, the absenteeism rate of employees due to illness decreased by 26% compared to the same period in 1953. The service attitude of medical personnel has also improved. In his report, he proposed that in the future, we should continue to strengthen factory and mine health work, further implement the principle of health work serving production; comprehensively arrange and rectify medical and health institutions, improve the quality of medical care, and resolutely correct the tendency to pursue quantity only, be greedy for more and faster results, and not pay attention to medical effects; continue to carry out the Patriotic Health Campaign, strengthen epidemic prevention work, and strengthen leadership and management of private doctors.

    In his report, Yang Yimin proposed that in order to adapt to the development of the capital's construction and gradually meet the growing needs of the capital's people's living standards, actively developing vegetable and fruit production, developing animal husbandry, and vigorously planting trees and afforestation are the main tasks of agricultural production in the suburbs in 1955. According to this task, this year the suburban vegetable production will increase by 22.9%, dairy cows will increase by 20.4%, pigs will increase by 30%, and sheep will increase by 20%. This year, 120,000 high-quality fruit trees will be promoted in the suburbs, 5 million trees will be planted by the state, and the masses will be mobilized to plant a large number of fruit trees and other trees.

    During the discussion, the representatives expressed satisfaction with these two reports. They raised serious criticisms and suggestions for improvement regarding the lack of unified leadership in medical institutions, the poor quality of medical care, and the poor service attitude of medical personnel in health work. Health workers and staff of medical institutions among the representatives made self-criticisms at the meeting, expressing their willingness to humbly accept criticisms and do their work well. During the discussion, many suburban representatives expressed that they would lead the farmers in the entire suburbs to strive to complete this year's agricultural production tasks. Liu Changling, director of the Hongguang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiaohongmen Township, Nanyuan District, proposed that this year, vegetable planting should improve technology and strengthen management, and increase production by more than 25% on the same sown area as last year. Yan Hechun, director of the Laiguangying Agricultural Production Cooperative, proposed that their cooperative will convert 60 mu of dry land into vegetable fields this year to increase vegetable production. Representatives from government agencies, troops, schools, and other units also proposed that they should actively participate in voluntary labor for tree planting and afforestation.

    The representatives submitted 141 proposals related to municipal construction, culture, education, and health at the meeting.

    Mayor Peng Zhen spoke at the meeting. On behalf of the elected members of the Municipal People's Committee, he expressed gratitude to the representatives for their trust and entrustment, and promised to do their best to do their work well. He pointed out that to solve the current problems in medical and health work, it is necessary to implement the principle of "popularization first, and improvement on the basis of popularization." He also analyzed the current situation at the meeting, calling on the people of the city to strengthen unity, work hard, practice thrift, and effectively use manpower, materials, and financial resources directly to develop production, strengthen national defense, liberate Taiwan, and other most urgent undertakings.

    杨益民在报告中提出：为适应首都建设的发展，逐步满足首都人民生活水平日益增长的需要，积极发展蔬菜、水果生产，发展牧畜事业和大力植树造林，是郊区一九五五年农业生产的主要任务。根据这个任务，今年郊区蔬菜将增产百分之二十二点九，乳牛将增加百分之二十点四，猪将增加百分之三十，羊将增加百分之二十。今年并将在郊区推广优良品种的果树十二万株，国营造林五百万株，还要动员群众大量栽植果树和其他树木。
    代表们在讨论中，对这两个报告表示满意。他们对卫生工作中医疗机构领导不统一，医疗质量不高，医务人员服务态度不好等方面提出了严肃的批评和改进的意见。代表中的卫生工作者和医疗机构的工作人员，在会上作了检查，表示虚心接受批评，做好工作。在讨论中，许多郊区代表表示要带动全郊区的农民努力完成今年的农业生产任务。南苑区小红门乡红光农业生产合作社主任刘长龄提出，今年种菜要提高技术，加强管理，要在去年同一播种面积上，增产百分之二十五以上。来广营农业生产合作社主任燕贺春提出，他们合作社今年要将六十亩旱田变为菜田，以增加蔬菜的产量。机关、部队、学校等方面的代表也都提出，要积极参加植树造林的义务劳动。
    代表们在会上提出了有关市政建设、文教卫生等方面的提案一百四十一件。
    彭真市长在会上讲了话。他代表当选的市人民委员会的组成人员对代表们的信任和委托表示感谢，保证尽所有的力量做好工作。他指出：解决目前医疗卫生工作的问题，必须贯彻普及第一，在普及的基础上提高的方针。他在会上还分析了目前的时局，号召全市人民加强团结，艰苦奋斗，厉行节约，切实地把人力、物力、财力直接用到发展生产、加强国防、解放台湾和其他最迫切的事业上去。
