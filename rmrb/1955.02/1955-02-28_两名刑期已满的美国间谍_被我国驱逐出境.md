Before and after liberation, she engaged in collecting intelligence on student patriotic movements, People's Liberation Army siege forces, land reform, and the Resist America, Aid Korea campaign. American spy Malcolm Bersohn came to China as early as 1945 to work as a spy for the American intelligence agency "Office of Strategic Services." He came to Beijing in June 1948 and later infiltrated Peking Union Medical College. During the siege of Beijing by the Chinese People's Liberation Army and after the liberation of Beijing, he continued to carry out espionage activities. In April 1951, Malcolm Bersohn provided information about the Chinese People's Volunteer Army to the American intelligence agency.
