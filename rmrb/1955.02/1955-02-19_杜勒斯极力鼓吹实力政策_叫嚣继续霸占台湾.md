Xinhua News Agency, Eighteenth Dispatch: New York News: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a speech on U.S. foreign policy at a dinner of the Foreign Policy Association on February 16th.

In his speech, Dulles tried his best to conceal the aggressive and bellicose nature of the policy of strength pursued by the United States. He hypocritically said that the goal of U.S. foreign policy was "to enable the American people to enjoy the blessings of freedom in peace," and that the United States "hopes to see peace permanently guaranteed." He even described the current war provocation actions against China as the United States' "contribution" to the "cause of peace." In order to justify America's aggressive foreign policy, Dulles routinely made vicious slanders and attacks against the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China in his speech.

Dulles advocated that the United States should continue to pursue a policy of strength. He insisted that Western European countries should approve the Paris Accords for the rearmament of West Germany as soon as possible.

Dulles indicated that in the past four years, the treaties concluded by the United States in the Far East with Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Japan, Syngman Rhee, and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, as well as the Manila Treaty, were intended to establish a so-called "joint security system" that "forms a large arc from the Aleutian Islands in the north to the South Pacific." Although this "large arc" is clearly intended to encircle China and invade Asia, Dulles still tried his best to describe it as "defensive."

When talking about the U.S.-Chiang treaty, in order to conceal the United States' brutal interference in China's internal affairs, he made it sound as if Taiwan and the Penghu Islands were not part of Chinese territory. He clamored that the United States would occupy Taiwan and the Penghu Islands and turn these Chinese territories into "an important part" of the U.S. "Western Pacific defense system."

Dulles once again threatened the Chinese people, saying that the United States would use its armed forces to "protect" Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, as well as "related positions and territories."

While talking about the United States' intention to occupy Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, Dulles expressed "welcome" to New Zealand's proposal in the United Nations Security Council for a "ceasefire" in certain coastal island areas of China. This clearly exposed the true purpose behind this "ceasefire" proposal.

When talking about the meeting of participating countries of the Manila Military Treaty initiated by the United States, which is about to be held in Bangkok, Dulles said that this meeting should address "three substantive issues." According to him, these three issues are so-called "military security," prevention of "subversive activities," and "economic welfare." In reality, what he was referring to was: the issue of organizing unified armed forces of the Manila Treaty countries under U.S. control, suppressing the national liberation movements in Asian countries, and expanding U.S. economic power in Asia. Regarding the last issue, Dulles specifically mentioned that the United States should "increase private investment" in Asia.

Dulles used the long-bankrupt myth of the so-called "iron fist of international communism" to intimidate Asian countries that pursue an independent foreign policy of maintaining peace. However, just from the issues to be discussed at the Bangkok meeting, one can see where the real "iron fist" threatening Asian countries comes from.

### 杜勒斯极力鼓吹实力政策  叫嚣继续霸占台湾

    杜勒斯极力鼓吹实力政策
    叫嚣继续霸占台湾
    【新华社十八日讯】纽约消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯二月十六日在外交政策协会的晚餐会上发表了关于美国外交政策的演说。
    杜勒斯在演说里竭力掩饰美国所奉行的实力政策的侵略性和好战性。他假惺惺地说什么美国外交政策的目标是“使美国人民能够和平地享受自由的幸福”，美国“希望看到和平永远得到保证”。他甚至把美国目前对中国的战争挑衅行动都说成是美国对“和平事业”的“贡献”。为了替美国侵略性的外交政策辩解，杜勒斯在演说中照例对苏联和中华人民共和国进行恶毒的诽谤和攻击。
    杜勒斯鼓吹美国要继续奉行实力政策。他坚持要西欧国家早日批准重新武装西德的巴黎协定。
    杜勒斯表明，在过去四年中，美国在远东同澳大利亚、新西兰、菲律宾、日本、李承晚、蒋介石卖国集团所缔结的条约和马尼拉条约，是要建立一个“北起阿留申群岛形成一个大弧形到南太平洋”的所谓“共同安全体系”。虽然这个“大弧形”显然是为了包围中国和侵略亚洲，杜勒斯却还竭力把它说成是“防御性”的。
    杜勒斯在谈到美蒋条约时，为了掩饰美国对中国内政的横暴干涉，他把话说得好像台湾和澎湖并不是中国领土的一部分。他叫嚣美国要霸占台湾和澎湖，要把这些中国领土变成美国“西太平洋防御体系”中的“一个重要部分”。
    杜勒斯再一次恫吓中国人民说，美国将用它的武装力量来“保护”台湾和澎湖以及“有关的阵地和领土”。
    杜勒斯在谈到美国要霸占台湾和澎湖的同时，表示“欢迎”新西兰在联合国安全理事会提出的在中国某些沿海岛屿地区“停火”的建议。这就清楚地暴露了这种“停火”建议背后的真正目的。
    在谈到美国发起的马尼拉军事条约参加国即将在曼谷举行的会议时，杜勒斯说，这次会议应当处理“三个实质问题”，照他说这三个问题是所谓
  “军事安全”、防止“颠覆活动”和“经济福利”问题，实际上他所指的是：组织在美国控制下的马尼拉条约国家统一的武装部队的问题，镇压亚洲国家民族解放运动的问题，和扩张美国在亚洲的经济势力的问题。关于最后一个问题，杜勒斯特别提到美国要在亚洲“增加私人投资”。
    杜勒斯用早已破产的所谓“国际共产主义的铁掌”的神话来恫吓执行维护和平的独立外交政策的亚洲国家，但是，只要从曼谷会议所要讨论的问题就可以看到，威胁着亚洲国家的真正“铁掌”来自何方。
