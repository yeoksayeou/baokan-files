As a member of the National Committee of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, I, Gao Shiqi, believe that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, are engaged in a historic task: striving to build our country into a great socialist nation. In order to achieve complete victory in this struggle, to consolidate our national defense, and to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world, we must liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.

Taiwan is Chinese territory. Liberating Taiwan is China's sovereignty and China's internal affair, and no foreign interference can be allowed.

However, the American bellicose group is not reconciled to the victory of the Chinese people's liberation cause, openly occupies Taiwan, and signed the so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, exhausting all kinds of war conspiracies and tricks, attempting to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, and recently has intensified, even wanting to use the mad clamor of atomic war to intimidate us.

The American bellicose group has forgotten their defeat on the Chinese mainland. Where have the eight million American-equipped Chiang Kai-shek troops gone? They have also forgotten the lessons they learned on the Korean battlefield. At that time, the mad American generals used heinous bacteriological weapons and clamored about using atomic weapons. What was the result? Were they not forced to cease fire?

The clamor of atomic war cannot scare the 600 million Chinese people. We have a vast territory, a dispersed population, and no centralized industry. The clamor of atomic war only makes the Americans mentally disordered and uneasy. It once again exposes the reactionary nature of American science. American science serves the war and attempts to use atomic weapons to massacre peaceful humans on a large scale. This shows that bourgeois science has developed to the most reactionary and cruel point. The reactionary scientists of the United States have become traitors to science and criminals of mankind.

It must be pointed out that the Soviet Union also possesses atomic and hydrogen weapons. The United States has long lost its monopoly in this regard. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov clearly announced in his report to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: "The Soviet Union has achieved such success in the manufacture of hydrogen weapons that it is the United States of America that lags behind, not the Soviet Union." However, the weapons of the Soviet Union are only manufactured as defensive weapons. The Soviet Union has continuously called for a ban on the use of such weapons of mass destruction.

Moreover, at the same time, Soviet scientists are engaged in a large amount of research work on the application of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. On June 27, 1954, the Soviet Union's first atomic energy industrial power station began to generate electricity. This factory without chimneys and power station without fuel will promote the production of socialist industry, accelerate the achievements of communist construction, and bring infinite happiness to the people of the world.

Obviously, the clamor of atomic war and the peaceful use of atomic energy are racing in two opposite directions: the former leads to destruction; the latter leads to prosperity.

The Chinese people, who are advancing along the socialist road, are taking the Soviet Union as an example. The Soviet Union is giving us selfless assistance in economy, culture, and science and technology. The unity and cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people is a strong bulwark for safeguarding the cause of world peace.

Now, at the time of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace, in response to the call of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, launching a signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons nationwide is of great significance. As Chinese scientific workers, we have the right to sign in this signature campaign; we also have the responsibility to take on the publicity work of opposing the use of atomic weapons and promoting the peaceful use of atomic energy, so that socialism can be realized in the land of 600 million people as soon as possible.

    把反对使用原子武器与和平利用原子能的宣传工作担当起来
    中华全国科学技术普及协会全国委员会委员  高士其
    中国人民在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下，正进行着一项历史性的任务：为把我们国家建成一个伟大的社会主义国家而斗争。为了使这斗争取得完全的胜利，为了要巩固我们的国防，维护远东和世界和平，我们一定要解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团。
    台湾是中国的领土，解放台湾是中国的主权，是中国的内政，不能允许外来的干涉。
    然而，美国好战集团，不甘心于中国人民解放事业的胜利，公然霸占台湾，和蒋介石卖国集团签订所谓“共同防御条约”，用尽种种战争阴谋诡计，企图阻挠中国人民解放台湾，最近更变本加厉，竟想用原子战争的狂妄叫嚣来恫吓我们。
    美国好战集团忘记了他们在中国大陆上的失败，八百万美制装备的蒋介石军队到哪里去了？他们也忘记了他们在朝鲜战场所受到的教训。那时候，疯狂的美国将军们使用过罪恶的细菌武器，也曾叫嚣过使用原子武器，结果打得怎样呢？还不是被迫而停战吗？
    原子战争的叫嚣是吓不倒中国六万万人民的。我们幅员辽阔，人口疏散，而又没有集中的工业。原子战争的叫嚣徒使美国人神经失常，心神不安。它又一次暴露了美国科学反动的本质。美国的科学是为战争服务的，企图使用原子武器来大规模屠杀和平人类，这说明资产阶级的科学发展到了最反动、最残酷的地步。美国的反动科学家们已经变成科学的叛徒，人类的罪人了。
    不能不指出，苏联也拥有原子武器和氢武器，美国在这方面早已失去垄断的地位，苏联外交部长莫洛托夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上的报告中已经明白的宣布了：“苏联人在氢武器制造方面已取得了如此的成就，以致落在后面的不是苏联，而是美利坚合众国了。”但是苏联的武器只是作为防卫的武器而制造的。苏联曾不断地提出禁止使用这种大规模毁灭性的武器的呼吁。
    而且，与此同时，苏联科学家们正在从事原子能应用于和平的目的的大量研究工作。在一九五四年六月二十七日，苏联第一座原子能工业电力站已经开始发电，这种没有烟筒的工厂和不用燃料的动力站，将促进社会主义工业的生产；加速共产主义建设的成就，将带给全世界人民以无穷的幸福。
    很明显，原子战争的叫嚣和原子能的和平利用，是在两个相反的道路上分驰的：前一条道路是走向毁灭；后一条道路是走向繁荣。
    正在沿着社会主义的大道前进的中国人民，是以苏联为榜样的，苏联在经济上、在文化上、在科学技术上都给我们以大公无私的援助。中苏两国人民的团结合作是保卫世界和平事业的强大堡垒。
    现在正当中苏友好同盟互助条约签订五周年纪念的时候，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员会和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员会，为了响应世界和平理事会常务委员会的号召，在全国发动反对使用原子武器的签名运动，是具有重大意义的。作为中国的科学工作者，我们有权利在这次签名运动中签名；也有责任把反对使用原子武器与和平利用原子能的宣传工作担当起来，使社会主义能在六亿人口的国土上早日实现。
