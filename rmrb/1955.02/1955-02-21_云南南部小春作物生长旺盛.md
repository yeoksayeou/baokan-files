The spring crops in the southern region of Yunnan Province are growing more vigorously than in previous years, and are now generally flowering and bearing fruit. Under the leadership of the Party, farmers of all ethnic groups have improved their production techniques. In the past, many farmers in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region never fertilized wheat or bean fields, but this year, they have applied an average of more than one load of fertilizer per mu. The October Red Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jingdong County has also changed the decades-old habit of planting on "white fields and white land," applying an average of forty to forty-five loads of base fertilizer per mu. Farmers in Simao County, who did not have the habit of weeding crops in the past, have weeded most of their spring crops once or twice this year. Counties with earlier seasons such as Jinggu, Jinping, and Hekou have successively begun sowing early rice seedlings since January. Farmers in Pu'er, Yuanyang, and other counties are busy transplanting double-cropping rice seedlings.

    云南南部小春作物生长旺盛
    云南省南部地区小春作物比往年都生长得旺盛，现已普遍开花结实。各族农民在党的领导下改进了生产技术，过去西双版纳傣族自治区有很多农民从来不给麦田、豆田施肥，今年平均每亩田都施了一挑以上的肥料；景东县十月红等农业生产合作社也改变了几十年来种“白田白地”的习惯，平均在每亩田里都施了四十至四十五挑的底肥；思茅县农民过去没有薅庄稼的习惯，今年小春作物大部都薅了一、二遍。季节较早的景谷、金平、河口等县，自一月以来，已先后开始撒早秧；普洱、元阳等县的农民正忙着栽插双季稻秧苗。
