Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 11th:

    U.S. military aircraft have intruded into the airspace of Northeastern China to conduct military provocations. At 10:26 AM on February 11th, four U.S. F-86 aircraft intruded into the airspace over the sea southwest of Andong City, Liaoning Province, China, to conduct provocative activities. Chinese People's Liberation Army aircraft immediately took off, and the U.S. aircraft then fled south.

    Sources here point out that the U.S. authorities are stepping up their military provocations against the Chinese people, seriously violating China's sovereignty. If the U.S. authorities disregard the repeated warnings of the Chinese people and continue to carry out military provocations, they must bear all the consequences.
