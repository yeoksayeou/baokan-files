    On February 7th, British Foreign Secretary Eden made extremely unfriendly remarks towards the Chinese people in the British House of Commons. Based on what Churchill said on July 12, 1954, regarding China's representation in the United Nations, he claimed: "Although Her Majesty's Government believes that the Central People's Government should represent China in the United Nations, in view of this government's consistent behavior that does not conform to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, Her Majesty's Government feels that this issue should not be considered for the time being."

    These words were spoken by the British Foreign Secretary at a time when the United States was directly involved in the military actions of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and when the United States was attempting to further invade China's coastal islands and expand its aggression against China. He chose such a moment to slander our country and oppose our country's legitimate rights and status in the United Nations. This is, in effect, encouraging the United States to aggress against our country, reassuring the United States to intensify the tense situation in the Taiwan area, and undermining peace and security in the Far East.

    The Chinese people feel great indignation at this statement by the British Foreign Secretary. The Chinese people have always abided by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, which conform to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, and this is recognized by all people of conscience. For several years, Eden has been very clear about who has been consistently violating the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and carrying out aggression everywhere. Speaking only of Taiwan and Penghu, according to reports in the British Daily Herald, Eden himself once said that these islands are "undoubtedly" part of China. However, for five years, the United States has violated the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter by invading these territories of China, directing the Chiang bandit clique to carry out various war activities against our country and disrupting freedom of navigation on the high seas. The United States has also concluded the US-Chiang Treaty with the Chiang bandit clique, carried out large-scale military concentration on the Chinese coast, armed intervention in China's internal affairs, and undermined peace and security in the Far East. Eden should know that all of this is completely incompatible with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. However, instead of condemning the United States, he slanders China as consistently violating the United Nations Charter. Besides showing that Eden himself disregards the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter on this issue and supports the United States' unbridled violation of the United Nations Charter, what other explanation could there be?

    British Labor MP Shinwell's criticism that Eden is "single-mindedly appeasing the United States" is factual. If it were not for this policy of "single-mindedly appeasing the United States," the United States would not be able to so confidently violate the United Nations Charter and carry out aggression against our country; it would not be able to so confidently carry out war threats and clamor for atomic weapons intimidation. This policy is of course welcomed by the United States, but it is opposed by the British people.

    News from Britain shows that people from broad strata of British society and fair-minded public opinion oppose this policy. The Scottish Committee of the British Cooperative Union, which has 11 million members, has passed a resolution demanding that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique be driven out of Taiwan. The Political Committee of the London Cooperative Society, which has one million members, has also passed a resolution emphasizing that the rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations must be restored. British Labor MP Bevan has also delivered speeches to the masses, advocating that the first necessary step towards peace in the Far East is for the United Nations to reject the Chiang Kai-shek "government" and declare the government of the People's Republic of China as the legitimate government. Important British parties and democrats have also expressed varying degrees of dissatisfaction with Eden's stance on the Taiwan issue. This proves that this policy is not in the interests of the British people. Therefore, there is news that Eden is now in a difficult situation. This is imaginable. If a person in power wants to disregard the demands of his own people in order to accommodate the aggressive and war policies of another country, then not only will his experience be very difficult, but his struggle will ultimately be doomed to failure.

### 究竟是谁违反联合国宪章的宗旨和原则

    究竟是谁违反联合国宪章的宗旨和原则
    本月七日，英国外交大臣艾登在英国下院作出了对中国人民极不友好的表示。他根据邱吉尔在一九五四年七月十二日关于中国在联合国的代表权所说的话声称：“虽然女王政府认为中央人民政府应当在联合国中代表中国，但是，鉴于这个政府的一贯的不符合联合国宪章的宗旨和原则的行为，女王政府觉得，应该暂不考虑这个问题。”
    这番话是英国外交大臣在美国直接参预蒋介石卖国集团的军事行动的时候说的，是在美国企图进一步侵占我国沿海岛屿、扩大对中国的侵略的时候说的。他选择这样一个时机来诬蔑我国，来反对我国在联合国中的合法权利和地位，这在实际上就是鼓励美国对我国的侵略，使美国放心加剧台湾地区的紧张局势，破坏远东的和平和安全。
    中国人民对英国外交大臣的这项声明感到极大的愤怒。中国人民从来遵守符合联合国宪章的宗旨和原则的和平共处五项原则，这是一切有良心的人都承认的。几年以来，究竟是谁在一贯地违反联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，到处进行侵略，艾登当然非常清楚。仅仅就台湾和澎湖来讲，根据英国每日先驱报的报道，艾登自己也曾说过这些岛屿“无疑”是中国的一部分。可是，五年以来，美国违反联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，侵占中国的这些领土，指使蒋贼集团对我国进行各种战争活动并破坏公海航行自由。美国又同蒋贼集团订立美蒋条约，在中国沿海进行大规模的军事集中，武装干涉中国内政，破坏远东的和平和安全。所有这一切，艾登应该知道都是同联合国宪章的宗旨和原则绝不相容的。但是，他却不但不谴责美国，反来诬蔑中国一贯地违反联合国宪章。这除了说明艾登自己在这个问题上轻视联合国宪章的宗旨和原则，并且支持美国放肆地违反联合国宪章之外，还能够有别的解释么？
    英国工党议员辛威尔批评艾登“一心一意姑息美国”是合乎事实的。如果不是这种“一心一意姑息美国”的政策，美国就不能那么放心地违反联合国宪章，对我国肆行侵略；它就不能那么放心地进行战争威胁和叫嚣原子武器恐吓。这个政策当然是美国所欢迎的，但却是英国人民所反对的。
    从英国来的消息可以看出，英国广大阶层的人民和公正舆论反对这种政策。拥有一千一百万人的英国合作社联盟的苏格兰委员会就曾通过决议，要求把蒋介石卖国集团赶出台湾。有一百万社员的伦敦合作社的政治委员会也通过决议强调指出，必须恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的权利。英国工党议员比万也曾向群众发表演说，主张走向远东和平的第一个必要步骤是联合国拒绝蒋介石“政府”，并且宣布中华人民共和国政府是合法政府。英国的重要党派和民主人士也对艾登在台湾问题上的主张表示了各种程度的不满。这证明这种政策不符合英国人民的利益。因此，有消息说，艾登现在的处境很困难。这可以想像得到。一个当政人士如果要想不顾本国人民的主张来将就另外一个国家的侵略政策和战争政策，那么，不但他的遭遇会很困难，而且他的挣扎终久还一定要失败。
