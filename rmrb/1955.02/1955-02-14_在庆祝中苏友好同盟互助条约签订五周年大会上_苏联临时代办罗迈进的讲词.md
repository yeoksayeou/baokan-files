Comrade Chairman! Dear Comrades and Friends!

    Five years ago, the people of the two greatest countries in the world solidified, in the form of a treaty, the unbreakable foundation of their economic and cultural ties and fraternal cooperation in international relations. This event is of world historical significance.

    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, signed on February 14, 1950, greatly strengthened the immense creative power of our two peoples and united us in our common desire to strive for further prosperity and a happy life.

    The Great October Socialist Revolution laid the foundation for the friendship between our two peoples. The Soviet people have always held deep and sincere friendship and respect for the great Chinese people and their heroic struggle for liberation against feudalism and imperialist oppression.

    The peoples of the Soviet Union and China have always wished to live in fraternal friendship and good neighborly relations. However, the enemies of the Soviet and Chinese peoples feared the establishment of close relations between us and did everything possible to obstruct them.

    The great victory won by the Chinese people under the leadership of the glorious, battle-tested Communist Party of China over domestic and foreign reactionary forces has created favorable conditions for the development of the close friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China, which has a deep historical foundation.

    Over the past five years, the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the Soviet and Chinese peoples have achieved unprecedented development and strengthening. It is manifested in political, economic, and cultural aspects.

    The publication of the Sino-Soviet Communiqué of October 12, 1954, and the joint declaration of the Soviet and Chinese governments on a number of extremely important issues are new confirmations of this increasingly consolidated friendship and cooperation.

    These documents demonstrate the greatest strength of the new type of socialist relationship between our two peoples. The results of the Sino-Soviet talks in Beijing have been warmly welcomed by peace-loving people of all nationalities around the world and have been hailed as a new and significant contribution to the further consolidation of the cause of peace and security.

    In the past five years, tremendous changes have taken place in the lives of the Chinese people. The Communist Party of China and the People's Government, creatively applying the invincible revolutionary doctrine of Marxism-Leninism and relying on the unprecedentedly high enthusiasm of the masses, have restored everything destroyed by the imperialist elements in a short period of time and have launched socialist construction.

    The tremendous achievements made by the Chinese people in such a short period of time have now been legally enshrined in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which has been discussed by the entire people and supported by 600 million people. The Soviet people are extremely pleased to learn that the fraternal friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples has been recorded in gold in the fundamental law of the People's Republic of China. The Soviet people are fully convinced that, as stated in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, "This friendship will continue to develop and be consolidated."

    The international status of the People's Republic of China has been consolidated as never before. China is no longer a target of exploitation by imperialist countries. It has become a source of progress and a powerful factor of great importance in Asia and the Pacific region. The People's Republic of China has indeed won the sympathy and friendship of the people of Asia and other countries around the world. The Soviet people sincerely wish you, beloved friends, even greater achievements, further prosperity, and happiness!

    Today, Asian countries such as India, Burma, and Indonesia, together with the People's Republic of China, advocate the peaceful settlement of international disputes.

    Today, those pathetic politicians in Washington have no other way out but to engage in despicable intimidation and gamble on anti-people scum like the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.

    They are attempting to provoke the Chinese people in various ways. But the American imperialists cannot intimidate the 600 million Chinese people, who have proved themselves to be invincible and have the will and determination to defend their security and independence.

    Washington's absurd plan to restore its rule on Chinese soil can only be found in the dustbin of history.

    The Soviet people fervently hope that the great Chinese people will liberate Taiwan and realize their sovereignty over Taiwan. They firmly believe that the just cause of the Chinese people will surely triumph.

    The unbreakable alliance between the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the People's Democracies is a strong bulwark for world peace and security. The friendly relations between our countries are consolidated and unbreakable. These relations are linked together in the common struggle for peace and international security. The strong economic and cultural ties between our two countries, our mutual sincerity and selflessness, and the fraternal friendship between our two countries make this relationship consolidated and unbreakable.

    On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, the Soviet people warmly congratulate the fraternal Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China on their new achievements in realizing national industrialization, developing agriculture, improving the people's welfare, and in the cause of consolidating their People's Democratic State.

    May the mutual assistance between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, a powerful factor for world peace, continue to develop and consolidate!

    Long live the eternal and unbreakable fraternal friendship between the peoples of our two countries!

    在庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订五周年大会上
    苏联临时代办罗迈进的讲词主席同志！亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    五年以前，世界上最伟大的两个国家的人民，用条约的形式把在经济和文化方面的联系以及在国际关系上兄弟合作的不可动摇的基础固定了下来。这件事情是具有世界历史意义的。
    一九五○年二月十四日签订的中苏友好同盟互助条约，大大加强了我们两国人民的巨大创造力量，并把我们在为争取进一步繁荣和幸福生活的共同愿望下团结在一起。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命为我们两国人民之间的友谊奠定了基础。苏联人民对于伟大的中国人民及其为反对封建主义和帝国主义压迫而进行的英勇解放斗争，一向是怀着深厚而真挚的友情和敬意的。
    苏中两国人民一向都愿望在兄弟般的友好和善邻关系中相处。但是，苏中两国人民的敌人却害怕我们建立亲密的关系，并百般地进行阻挠。
    中国人民在光荣的久经战斗考验的中国共产党的领导下，战胜国内外反动力量而取得的伟大胜利，为苏中两国人民之间具有深厚历史基础的亲密友谊的发展，创造了良好的条件。
    五年来，苏中两国人民之间的兄弟般的友谊与合作获得了空前的发展与加强。它表现在政治、经济、文化各个方面。
    一九五四年十月十二日苏中会谈公报和苏中两国对于许多极重大的问题的联合宣言的发表，就是这种日益巩固着的友谊与合作的新的确证。
    这些文献显示出我们两国人民之间的新型的社会主义关系的最伟大的力量。苏中两国在北京会谈的结果，受到了全世界爱好和平的各族人民的极为热烈的欢迎，并被评价为是对于进一步巩固和平与安全事业的新的重大的贡献。
    五年来，中国人民的生活中发生了巨大的变化。中国共产党和人民政府创造性地运用着马克思列宁主义战无不胜的革命学说，依靠着群众空前高涨的热情，在短短的期间内，便恢复了遭受帝国主义分子破坏的一切，并且展开了社会主义建设。
    中国人民在这样短短的时期里所获得的巨大成就，如今已经用立法的形式在经过全民讨论而获得六万万人民拥护的中华人民共和国的宪法里固定下来。苏联人民极其高兴地获悉，苏中两国人民的兄弟友谊，已经用金字记载在中华人民共和国的根本法里面。苏联人民完全相信中华人民共和国宪法里所说的：“这种友谊将继续发展和巩固”。
    中华人民共和国的国际地位空前地巩固了。中国已经不再是受帝国主义各国剥削的对象，它已变成为进步的发源地，变成为亚洲和太平洋区域举足轻重的强大因素。中华人民共和国确确实实地赢得了亚洲和全世界其他各国人民的同情和友谊。苏联人民衷心愿望你们，敬爱的朋友们，取得更大的成就、进一步的繁荣和幸福！
    如今，像印度、缅甸和印度尼西亚这些亚洲国家，都和中华人民共和国一起主张通过和平方式解决国际争端。
    如今，华盛顿那些可怜的政客们除了从事卑鄙的恫吓，在蒋介石匪帮这类反人民的渣滓身上打算盘之外，已经别无出路了。
    他们企图对中国人民进行各种挑衅。但是美国帝国主义者们是吓不倒六万万中国人民的，中国人民已经证实了自己是不可战胜的，并且他们具有保卫自己的安全与独立的意志和决心。
    华盛顿梦想在中国土地上恢复其统治的狂妄计划，只有在历史的垃圾堆里才能找到。
    苏联人民热烈地希望伟大的中国人民解放台湾并在台湾实现自己的主权。他们坚定不移地相信：中国人民的正义事业一定胜利。
   苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家之间的牢不可破的联盟，是全世界和平与安全的强大的堡垒。我们国家之间的友谊关系，是巩固的和牢不可破的。这种关系是在争取和平与国际安全的共同斗争中所连结起来的。我们两国之间的经济和文化的坚强联系，我们相互之间的真诚、大公无私，我们两国之间的兄弟般的友谊，使得这种关系变得巩固和牢不可破。
    值此中苏友好同盟互助条约签订五周年之际，苏联人民热烈地祝贺兄弟般的中国人民和中华人民共和国政府在实现国家工业化、发展农业和提高人民福利的事业中，以及在努力巩固自己的人民民主国家的事业中获得新的成就。
    祝世界和平的强大因素——苏联和中华人民共和国之间的互助不断发展与巩固！
    我们两国人民之间的永恒的牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊万岁！
