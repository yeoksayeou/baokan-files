Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League Vice Chairman Li Chunqing

    After our army liberated Yijiangshan Island, the American government deployed its forces on China's sea, forcing us to accept its so-called "ceasefire" and its demarcation, ceding Taiwan, Penghu, and coastal islands.

    At this time, British Foreign Secretary Eden swallowed the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation in one gulp, chanting incantations,妄想使台湾地图变色. The British government is both pitiful and hateful for daring not to talk about right and wrong,妄想中国满足美国的侵略要求. It and the American government are conspiring to divide China's territory in collusion.

    The US government is starting a war because it wants to interfere in China's internal affairs, pushing people too far! The British government openly denies that Taiwan is Chinese territory in order to please the United States,欺人太甚!

    Is China such a country that can be forced and bullied?

    No, absolutely not!

    All aggressors and international political brokers should be notified: there is no Li Hongzhang, no Yuan Shikai, and no Kuomintang government of 1931 in China now. Do not mistakenly judge that the Chinese people will not resist aggression, and do not dream that the Chinese people will be willing to negotiate the cession of Taiwan. If they think China is可迫可欺的, it will be extremely dangerous for them!

    China has not opened fire with the United States, and there is no fire to cease at all. In fact, there is no international issue that needs to be negotiated for a "ceasefire." As for China's internal affairs, according to the United Nations Charter, no other country is absolutely allowed to interfere. The Chinese civil war has been going on for seven or eight years from 1947 to now, and it can never be said that it suddenly threatens the security of the United States' defense 5,000 miles away today. The fact is that today the US Seventh Fleet has entered the Taiwan Strait, and two US Air Force wings have been stationed in Taiwan, which poses an extremely serious threat to China's independence and security. If the US government wants to impose war on the Chinese people, then we will never show weakness, never yield, and will definitely fight the aggressors to the end. It is undeniable that the US government has already created a war-filled danger in the Far East situation at this moment.

    In view of the above dangerous situation, Soviet Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations Security Council Sobolev requested an emergency meeting of the Security Council on January 30 to take urgent measures to stop the US aggression against China and interference in China's internal affairs. We believe that the Soviet proposal is completely justified and very timely. The Chinese people unanimously support this proposal.

    The real reason for the tension in the Far East situation lies in the United States' occupation of China's territory Taiwan and its expanding aggression; it also lies in the British government's support for the US aggression against China. For the sake of peace, China has repeatedly stated its solemn attitude. For those deaf疯子, it may be worth saying it again: the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, never tolerate the sacrifice of an inch of land, and will never let the American robbers hold the gate of China without driving them away. We have the power to do so. Since Yijiangshan Island can be liberated, Taiwan is also a coastal island of China, and there is no reason why it cannot be liberated. The eight million people of Taiwan vow to fight to break free from their chains. They will surely break free from their chains and will never be foreign slaves. Whoever dares to covet Taiwan's 36,000 square kilometers of Chinese territory, let him pay attention. The Chinese people, including the people of Taiwan, will surely teach him a heavy lesson and will never give up until they drive him away.

### 拥护苏联的建议

    拥护苏联的建议
    台湾民主自治同盟副主席　李纯青
    在我军解放一江山岛以后，美国政府陈兵在中国海面，逼迫我们接受它的所谓“停火”，和它划界线，割让台湾澎湖及沿海岛屿。
    这时候，英国外相艾登一口吞下了开罗宣言、波茨坦公告，念念有词，妄想使台湾地图变色。英国政府极其可怜也极其可恨地竟不敢谈是非曲直，妄想中国满足美国的侵略要求。它和美国政府有约而同地在共谋割裂中国的领土。
    美国政府因为要干涉中国内战而大动干戈，迫人太甚！英国政府因为要讨好美国而公然否认台湾是中国的领土，欺人太甚！
    难道中国竟是那么可迫可欺的国家吗？
    不，绝对的不！
    应该通告一切侵略分子和国际政治掮客们周知：现在中国已经没有李鸿章，没有袁世凯，也没有一九三一年时代的国民党政府了。不要错误地判断中国人民对侵略会不抵抗，不可梦想中国人民会愿意谈判割让台湾。如果他们认为中国是可迫可欺的，那对他们将是极其危险的！
    中国并没有和美国开火，根本无火可停。事实上并不存在需要谈判“停火”的国际问题。至于中国内政问题，根据联合国宪章，那是绝对不容他国干涉的。中国内战，从一九四七年到现在已有七、八年，绝不能说今天就忽然威胁到五千浬外的美国国防的安全。事实是，今天美国第七舰队开进台湾海峡，美国空军两个联队进驻台湾，这才是对中国的独立和安全构成极端严重的威胁。如果美国政府要把战争强加在中国人民的头上，那我们绝不示弱，绝不屈服，一定和侵略者周旋到底。无可否认，此刻美国政府已经把远东形势造成充满战争的危险。
    鉴于上述的危险形势，苏联常驻联合国安全理事会副代表索波列夫已于一月三十日要求召开安全理事会紧急会议，采取紧急措施，制止美国对中国的侵略和对中国内政的干涉。我们认为苏联的建议是完全正当的，非常合时的。中国人民一致拥护这个建议。
    远东局势紧张的真正原因，在于美国侵占中国的领土台湾和正在扩大它的侵略；也在于英国政府支持美国对中国的侵略。为了和平，中国已经一再表明严正的态度，对于那些装作聋子的疯子，不妨再说一遍：中国人民一定要解放台湾，绝不忍让牺牲一寸国土，绝不会让美国强盗把住中国的大门而不把它撵走。我们是有力量这样做的。一江山岛既然可以解放，台湾也是中国的沿海岛屿，没有不可以解放的道理。八百万台湾人民誓为挣脱锁链而斗争，他们必能挣脱锁链，绝对不做外国的奴隶。谁敢垂涎台湾三万六千方公里的中国江山，就叫他注意，中国人民包括台湾人民必将重重地教训他一顿，不把他撵走决不罢休。
