Whoever Dares to Launch an Atomic War Will Inevitably Perish Himself
Zhong Huilan, Director of the Central People's Hospital

The reason why we human beings are different from beasts is that we have wisdom and morality. Because of wisdom, we can study science and transform nature; because of morality, we can use great scientific inventions for peaceful construction to benefit mankind. The moving examples of the Soviet Union using atomic energy to transform nature, using it to blast mountains, open up rivers, and turn deserts into fertile fields, are concrete manifestations of human wisdom and morality, and vivid examples of science serving the cause of human happiness. The world's peace and democracy camp, headed by the Soviet Union, has always insisted that science should serve the cause of human happiness. The Soviet Union has repeatedly demanded that all countries in the world unconditionally prohibit the use of atomic weapons and destroy existing atomic and hydrogen weapons. Recently, the Soviet Union generously decided to assist our country and other people's democratic countries in researching and utilizing atomic energy for the development of peaceful construction. With such selfless assistance from the Soviet Union, not only will our country's industry, agriculture, water conservancy, transportation, and other undertakings make astonishingly rapid progress in the future, but our country's medicine will also develop rapidly. In medical research, especially for animal and human intermediary metabolism and certain research work, foreign countries have successfully tried using radioactive isotopes phosphorus, uranium, strontium, calcium, iodine, iron, mercury, manganese, gold, etc. In treatment, radioactive 32 phosphorus has been tried to treat various leukemias, polycythemia vera, lymphomas, and other cancers; radioactive 24 sodium has also been tried to treat various leukemias and polycythemia vera, and radioactive iodine has also been tried to treat hyperthyroidism and thyroid cancer. These aspects have achieved varying degrees of effectiveness and have opened up a broad new path in modern medical diagnosis, treatment, and research methods, which will surely be of great help to future domestic clinical and research work. This series of facts shows that the same scientific invention, if it is in the hands of the people, it is a good friend who serves the people; if it is in the hands of the imperialists, it can become a tool for slaughtering mankind. We must remember: no matter how ferocious and brutal the imperialists are, the great power of the united people of the world can crush any vicious conspiracy of imperialism. U.S. imperialism, because of its constant mad clamoring for atomic war, has aroused the resentment and condemnation of the people of the world. If it dares to launch an atomic war, it will inevitably perish itself in the future. In order to defend world peace and build our motherland, we enthusiastically participate in the signature campaign and work doubly hard at our posts to complete the glorious task of liberating Taiwan, the sacred territory of our motherland.

    谁如果敢于发动原子战争最后灭亡的必然是他自己
    中央人民医院院长　钟惠澜
    我们人类之所以异于野兽者，因其有智慧有道德。由于有智慧而能研究科学，改造自然；由于有道德而能将伟大的科学发明用于为人类谋幸福的和平建设。苏联利用原子能来改造自然，用它来爆炸山岳，开辟河道，变沙漠为良田等动人例子，就是人类智慧与道德的具体表现，也是科学为人类幸福事业服务的活生生的例子。以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，一向坚持科学为人类幸福事业服务的主张，苏联曾经屡次要求全世界各国无条件禁止使用原子武器并销毁现存的原子武器和氢武器。苏联最近更慷慨地决定协助我国和其他人民民主国家研究和利用原子能，为人类发展和平建设事业。通过苏联这样无私的协助，今后我国不止工业、农业、水利、交通等事业会有惊人的迅速进展，我国医学也会有迅速的发展。在医学研究方面，尤其是对于动物和人类的中间新陈代谢和某些研究工作，国外曾经成功的试用了放射性同位素磷、铀、锶、钙、碘、铁、汞、锰、金等。在治疗方面，曾经试用了放射性32磷来治疗各种白血病，红血球增多症，淋巴瘤和其他癌瘤；也曾试用放射性24纳治疗各种白血病和红血球增多症，同样也试用了放射性碘来治疗甲状腺机能亢进症和甲状腺癌。这些方面都已经取得不同程度的效果，在现代医学的诊断治疗与研究工作方法上开辟了一个广阔的新道路，对于将来国内的临床和研究工作，一定会有很大的帮助。这一系列的事实，说明了同是一样的科学发明，如果掌握在人民手里，它是为人民服务的良友；如果掌握在帝国主义手里，它就能变成屠杀人类的工具。我们必须记着：无论帝国主义者如何凶恶残暴，我们团结在一起的全世界人民的伟大力量是可以粉碎任何帝国主义的恶毒阴谋的。美帝国主义因为不断发出原子战争的疯狂叫嚣，已经引起全世界人民的愤恨和谴责。如果它胆敢发动原子战争，将来灭亡的必然是它自己。我们为了保卫世界和平，建设祖国，我们热烈参加签名运动，在自己的岗位上加倍努力工作，一定要完成解放祖国神圣领土台湾的光荣任务。
