    After the People's Liberation Army victoriously liberated Yijiangshan Island, the American aggressors, disregarding the opposition of all upright people in the world, intensified their military actions and war provocations in the Taiwan area of our country. They also orchestrated the United Nations to play the trick of a so-called "mediation for a ceasefire" to interfere in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. Recently, the New Zealand government, following the United States, suggested that the United Nations Security Council hold a meeting to discuss the issue of "armed hostilities occurring in certain island areas near the coast of mainland China" between our country and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. This suggestion is obviously a concrete step by the U.S. aggressors to orchestrate the "ceasefire" trick. Both legally and factually, this suggestion is untenable. The Chinese people resolutely oppose the U.S. aggressors' war provocations and "ceasefire" trick, and we absolutely disagree with New Zealand's absurd suggestion that serves the U.S. aggression. Taiwan is our country's territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan.
    The tense situation in the Taiwan area is entirely created by the American aggressors. The Chinese people's liberation of their own territory has never caused international tension. If the United Nations were not a tool of the U.S. aggressors, if it shouldered the responsibility for maintaining peace as stipulated in its Charter, it should have taken action long ago to stop the U.S. aggression and armed interference against our country and to make all U.S. armed forces withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. If the New Zealand government is genuinely concerned about peace in the Far East, it should also demand that the United Nations do so. Only in this way can the tense situation in the Taiwan area be truly eased and be conducive to peace in the Far East. The United Nations has long ignored what it should do. The governments of countries like Britain and New Zealand emphasize not discussing right and wrong, which in fact is helping the wicked to do evil, and should be condemned by justice throughout the world.
    The Chinese people's liberation of their own territory, Taiwan, is entirely our country's sovereignty and internal affair. What right does the United Nations or other foreign countries have to interfere? Article 2, paragraph 7 of the United Nations Charter clearly stipulates: "Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter." On what basis can the United Nations violate its Charter and interfere in the liberation of Taiwan, which is essentially a matter within our country's domestic jurisdiction? Moreover, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique entrenched in Taiwan is a national traitor that the Chinese people must eliminate, and Taiwan, occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, is the territory that the Chinese people must liberate. How can we have a ceasefire with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique? It is very clear that to ask us to have a ceasefire with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is to sell out our country's territorial sovereignty, to recognize the so-called "two Chinas," to allow the U.S. aggressors to occupy Taiwan and Penghu for a long time and use them as a springboard for expanding aggression against our country, and to condone the U.S. aggressors to wantonly divide our country's territory and prepare new wars on our territory. This is tolerable? What is intolerable?
    Who with a conscience in the world cannot see that while Eisenhower is orchestrating "mediation for a ceasefire by the United Nations," the U.S. aggressors are stepping up arrangements for new war provocations against the Chinese people and using atomic weapons for intimidation. In particular, the so-called special message on "the situation developing in the Taiwan Strait" that this same Eisenhower presented to the U.S. Congress on January 24 is a naked war message. In this message, he requested Congress to immediately authorize him with a specific resolution to "use the armed forces of the United States to secure and protect Taiwan and the Pescadores" when necessary, and said that as long as "in situations where it could be demonstrated that an attack upon Taiwan and the Pescadores was part of an attack or preparation for attack upon the main positions," he could "use the power that Congress may grant." The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have successively passed a joint proposal giving Eisenhower the broad power requested in the message to intervene militarily in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and Penghu and to expand aggression against our country. This fully exposes that "mediation for a ceasefire by the United Nations" is a complete and utter fraud, a cover for the U.S. attempt to once again promote a policy of war and aggression under the banner of the United Nations. Therefore, those who echo the U.S. position in various guises cannot but be accomplices of the U.S. aggressors.
    The Chinese people have rich experience in fighting the enemy, and no conspiracy or trickery can deceive us. The U.S. aggressors' attempt to use a two-pronged approach of armed interference and playing "ceasefire" tricks to intimidate us, so that their plot to interfere in our internal affairs, divide our country's territory, and use Taiwan as a military base to prepare new wars against the Chinese people can succeed, is absolutely impossible. The Chinese people who have stood up are not afraid of war threats. If the U.S. aggressors dare to invade us with armed forces, we will definitely give them a resolute counterattack. The Chinese people were able to victoriously liberate Yijiangshan Island, and they will certainly be able to continue their efforts and liberate Taiwan. The entire Chinese people resolutely support the statement made by our Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on January 24: "In order to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, in order to safeguard China's security and peace in the Far East, the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, the United States must stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and all U.S. armed forces must withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait."

    反对美国侵略者策动联合国进行所谓停火的阴谋
    中国民主促进会主席  马叙伦
    当我人民解放军胜利解放一江山岛之后，美国侵略者悍然不顾全世界一切正直人类的反对，变本加厉地在我国台湾地区加紧进行军事行动和战争挑衅，并且策动通过联合国玩弄所谓“斡旋停火”的诡计，来干涉我国人民解放台湾。最近新西兰政府更追随美国之后，建议联合国安全理事会举行会议，讨论我国和蒋介石卖国集团“在中国大陆沿海附近的某些岛屿的地区发生武装敌对行动”的问题。这个建议显然是美国侵略者策动“停火”诡计的一个具体步骤。无论在法理上和事实上，这个建议都是说不通的。我国人民坚决反对美国侵略者的战争挑衅和“停火”诡计，也决不同意新西兰为美国侵略目的服务的荒谬建议。台湾是我国的领土，我国人民一定要解放台湾。
    在台湾地区的紧张局势是美国侵略者一手造成的，我国人民解放自己的领土从来不曾引起国际局势的紧张。如果联合国不是美国侵略者的御用工具，如果负起它在宪章上所规定的维护和平的责任，它早就应该采取行动，制止美国对我国的侵略和武装干涉，使美国一切武装力量从台湾和台湾海峡撤走。新西兰政府如果真正关心远东和平，它也应该要求联合国这样做。只有如此，才能真正缓和台湾地区的紧张局势和有利于远东的和平。联合国对它应该做的事长期置之不理，像英国和新西兰的政府强调不谈是非曲直，实际即是助桀为虐，都是应该受到全世界的正义谴责的。
    我国人民解放自己的领土台湾，完全是我国的主权和内政，联合国和其他外国有什么权可以横加干涉呢？联合国宪章第二条第七款明明规定：“本宪章不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件，且并不要求会员国将该项事件依本宪章提请解决。”联合国凭什么可以违反它的宪章干涉在本质上属于我国国内管辖的解放台湾问题呢？况且盘踞台湾的蒋介石卖国集团是我国人民必须消灭的国贼，蒋介石卖国集团所盘踞的台湾是我国人民必须解放的国土，我们怎能同蒋介石卖国集团停火？非常明显，要我们同蒋介石卖国集团停火，就是出卖我国的领土主权，就是承认所谓“两个中国”，就是听任美国侵略者长期霸占台湾、澎湖，并利用来作为对我国扩大侵略的跳板，就是纵容美国侵略者可以为所欲为地割裂我国领土，并在我国领土上准备新的战争。是而可忍，孰不可忍？
    全世界一切有良心的人谁看不到：就是在艾森豪威尔策动“由联合国斡旋停火”的同时，美国侵略者正加紧安排对我国人民的新战争挑衅，并以原子武器进行恫吓。尤其同是这个艾森豪威尔在一月二十四日向美国国会提出所谓关于“正在台湾海峡发展的局势”的特别咨文，是一个赤裸裸的战争咨文。在这个咨文中他要求国会立刻用具体的决议授权给他“在必要时使用美国的武装部队来保证台湾和澎湖列岛的安全”，并且说，只要“在可以证明是对台湾及澎湖主要阵地的进攻的一部分或其肯定预备步骤的局势下”，他就可以“使用国会所可能授予的权力”。而美国参议院和众议院已先后通过一个联合提案，给予艾森豪威尔咨文所要求的武装干涉我国人民解放台湾、澎湖和对我国扩大侵略的广泛权力。这就充分暴露“由联合国斡旋停火”，是彻头彻尾的骗局，是美国企图再一次打着联合国的旗帜来推行战争政策和侵略政策的掩护。因此，采取各种姿态附和美国主张的人，都不能不是美国侵略者的帮凶。
    我国人民有着对敌斗争的丰富经验，任何阴谋诡计和骗术都是瞒不过我们的。美国侵略者妄想通过武装干涉和玩弄“停火”诡计的双管齐下的办法，来吓唬我们，使它干涉我国内政、割裂我国领土、利用台湾作为军事基地准备新的针对我国人民的战争阴谋得逞，是绝对办不到的。站起来了的中国人民决不怕战争威胁。如果美国侵略者敢于以武装力量向我们进犯，我们一定予以坚决的回击。我国人民能够胜利地解放一江山岛，就一定能够再接再厉，解放台湾。全中国人民坚决拥护我周恩来总理兼外长一月二十四日的声明，“为了保障中国的主权和领土完整，为了保障中国的安全和远东的和平，中国人民必须解放台湾，美国必须停止对中国内政的干涉，美国的一切武装力量必须从台湾和台湾海峡撤走。”
