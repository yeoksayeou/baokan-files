Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 22nd: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on February 22nd, denouncing the convening of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization conference scheduled to open in Bangkok on February 23rd. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The success of the Geneva Conference has halted hostilities in Indochina, thereby promoting the relaxation of international tensions and creating favorable conditions for the peaceful resolution of outstanding disputes and hostilities. However, because this was a heavy blow to the US imperialists' policy of aggression and war preparations, in September 1954, the US imperialists roped in a majority of seven other countries not in Asia and signed the Manila Treaty to establish the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which is in fact an aggressive bloc in Southeast Asia.

Using phrases like "collective defense" and "maintaining common security" to conceal their conspiracy to invade other countries is an old trick of the US imperialists that peace-loving people around the world have seen through based on their personal experiences over the past few years. Therefore, the people of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, the people of Asian countries, and all peace-loving people around the world unanimously and strongly protested against the establishment of this aggressive Southeast Asian bloc. Disregarding this increasingly intense and resolute opposition, the US imperialists have convened the Bangkok Conference, which will be held on February 23rd, in order to accelerate the realization of their aggressive conspiracy.

The main purpose of the US imperialists at the Bangkok Conference is to find ways to create new tensions in the Far East, expand their aggression in Asia, and accelerate preparations for a new war.

To achieve this goal, the US imperialists plan to convene the Bangkok Conference to increase the military strength of the Manila Treaty signatory countries and combine it under US command. The conference will discuss the establishment of a permanent body of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's aggressive military bloc and the establishment of mobile combat forces under the command of this permanent body. Therefore, it is very clear that the US imperialists are strengthening and combining military forces in order to provoke new tensions in Asia and prepare for a war of aggression against Asian countries.

The Bangkok Conference will discuss what the US imperialists call political chaos in the area protected by the Manila Treaty. In fact, this is just a smokescreen to facilitate the implementation of the US imperialists' plan to further interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries and intensify the suppression of the peaceful and democratic movements of the people of Asian countries.

The Bangkok Conference will also discuss economic "aid." However, everyone knows that what is concealed under the guise of "aid" is that the US imperialists have been painstakingly trying to plunder Asia's wealth and have been using dollar pressure in an attempt to subjugate the people of Asian countries.

Although the Manila Treaty has not yet been ratified by the parliaments of all signatory countries, the US imperialists hastily convened the Bangkok Conference. By doing so, they hope to diminish the influence of the Asian-African Conference scheduled to be held in Indonesia in April 1955, and undermine the efforts of the peoples and governments of Asian and African countries to defend peace, strive for national independence, and strengthen international friendship.

The military, political, and economic aggression schemes of the US imperialists at the upcoming Bangkok Conference are aimed at Asia as a whole, but are particularly targeted at South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Many reports and views from US diplomatic figures have revealed that the Bangkok Conference will be used almost entirely to discuss the Indochina issue.

The US imperialists want to use the Bangkok Conference to realize their conspiracy to sabotage the implementation of the Indochina armistice agreements, drag South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and obstruct Vietnam from achieving unification through free and democratic general elections. This perfidious scheme has recently been demonstrated by the new activities of the US imperialists in South Vietnam to undermine the Geneva armistice agreements. After J. Lawton Collins returned to Saigon from Washington, he praised the acts of terror and massacre against residents in South Vietnam, as well as the strangulation of democratic freedom. The US imperialists and their followers have been planning and intensifying the forced repatriation or enticement of North Vietnamese people to South Vietnam. They have been engaging in deception to transfer machinery and equipment from public organs and institutions of public utilities, forcibly evacuating civilians to South Vietnam with military violence, and creating difficulties in the discussions on the transfer of the Haiphong area. They are using US military and financial aid to implement their plan to increase the military strength of South Vietnam. These troops are trained by US General O'Daniel and are in fact commanded by the US imperialists, and are used to suppress the peaceful and democratic movements in South Vietnam, attempting to obstruct the unification of Vietnam and realize their conspiracy to divide Vietnam into two parts, turning South Vietnam into a US colony and military base.

The Bangkok Conference, convened for the purpose of intensifying the formation of the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and dragging South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos into this bloc, as well as other activities of the US imperialists in South Vietnam, are completely incompatible with the Geneva Accords. This is incompatible with Article 16 of the Vietnam Ceasefire Agreement regarding the prohibition of the entry of any reinforcements and military auxiliary personnel into Vietnam. This is incompatible with Article 17 of the aforementioned agreement regarding the prohibition of the entry of any reinforcements of various types of weapons, ammunition, and other war materials. This is also incompatible with Article 19 of the Vietnam Ceasefire Agreement and Item 5 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference. These two clauses stipulate that the two parties should pay attention to ensuring that the areas assigned to them do not participate in any military alliances and are not used to resume hostilities or serve aggressive policies.

The French government, as a signatory to the Geneva Armistice Agreements, participated in the Manila Conference and then participated in the Bangkok Conference, and must share its responsibility for the above-mentioned acts of sabotaging the armistice agreements. The belligerent cliques in Britain are following the US imperialists, violating the interests of the British people, and are opposed by the people of Asian countries and the people of the world.

The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have consistently and correctly and earnestly fulfilled the Geneva Armistice Agreements. The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, together with the peoples and governments of Asian countries, are working hard to defend peace and are actively implementing the policy of strengthening friendship between Asian countries based on the Five Principles proposed in the joint statement of the Prime Ministers of China and India and China and Burma.

Therefore, the Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam resolutely oppose the Bangkok Conference and strongly protest against the activities of the US imperialists to sabotage the Geneva Armistice Agreements.

The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are convinced that the perfidious conspiracy of the US imperialists is doomed to failure, the Geneva Armistice Agreements will certainly be strictly implemented, and their struggle to consolidate peace, achieve unification, and achieve independence and democracy throughout Vietnam will surely be victorious.

The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are deeply convinced that the peoples of Asian countries and the peoples of the world will not tolerate the conspiracy of the US imperialists to undermine peace and will further closely unite to oppose and smash the US imperialists' trick of using Asians to fight Asians, in order to safeguard peace in Asia and the world.

    越南民主共和国外交部发表声明
    反对曼谷会议破坏日内瓦协定
    【新华社讯】越南通讯社河内二十二日电：越南民主共和国外交部在二十二日发表声明，斥责定于二月二十三日在曼谷开幕的东南亚条约组织会议的召开。声明全文如下：
    日内瓦会议的成功已经使得印度支那的敌对行动停止，从而促进了国际紧张局势的缓和，并且为和平解决悬而未决的争端和敌对行动创造了良好的条件。但是，因为这对美帝国主义者的侵略和准备战争的政策是一个沉重的打击，美帝国主义者就在一九五四年九月拉拢多数不是在亚洲的七个其他国家，签订了马尼拉条约，来建立实际上是一个东南亚侵略集团的所谓东南亚条约组织。
    用“共同防御”、“维护共同安全”等类的词句来掩饰它们侵略其他国家的阴谋，是全世界爱好和平的人民根据过去几年来的亲身体验已经看穿了的美帝国主义者的老诡计。因此，越南、柬埔寨和老挝三国人民，亚洲各国人民以及全世界所有爱好和平的人民，一致强烈抗议建立这个侵略性的东南亚集团。美帝国主义者竟然不顾这种日益激烈和坚决的反对，召集了将在二月二十三日举行的曼谷会议，以便加速实现他们的侵略阴谋。
    美帝国主义者在曼谷会议上的主要目的是想找出办法在远东制造新的紧张局势，扩大他们在亚洲的侵略，以及加速准备新战争。
    为了达到这个目的，美帝国主义者计划召开曼谷会议，以便增加马尼拉条约签字国的军事力量，并且在美国的指挥下把它纠合起来。这个会议将讨论设立东南亚条约组织侵略性军事集团的一个常设机构的问题，和建立置于这个常设机构指挥下的机动战斗部队的问题。因此十分清楚，美帝国主义者正在加强和纠合军事力量，以便在亚洲挑拨起新的紧张局势，准备对亚洲国家的侵略战争。
    曼谷会议将讨论美帝国主义者所谓受马尼拉条约保护地区内政治混乱的问题。事实上，这不过是一种烟幕，以便于推行美帝国主义者想进一步干涉亚洲国家内政、加紧镇压亚洲各国人民和平民主运动的计划。
    曼谷会议还将讨论经济“援助”问题。但是，人人知道，在“援助”招牌下掩盖着的是：美帝国主义者一直在处心积虑地想掠夺亚洲的财富，一直在利用美元压力，企图使亚洲各国人民屈服。
    虽然马尼拉条约还没有得到所有签字国家的议会的批准，美帝国主义者就急忙召开了曼谷会议，他们这样做，是希望贬低预定在一九五五年四月在印度尼西亚召开的亚非会议的影响，破坏亚非各国人民和政府为保卫和平、争取民族独立和加强国际友好而作的努力。
    美帝国主义者在就要召开的曼谷会议上的军事、政治和经济侵略诡计，是以亚洲为总目标，但特别针对着南越、老挝和柬埔寨。许多消息和美国外交界人物的看法透露出来：曼谷会议将几乎完全用来讨论印度支那问题。
    美帝国主义者想利用曼谷会议来实现他们破坏履行印度支那停战协定的阴谋，把南越以及柬埔寨和老挝拉入东南亚侵略集团，并且阻挠越南通过自由和民主的普选取得统一。这种背信弃义的计谋最近已经由美帝国主义者在越南破坏日内瓦停战协定的新活动中得到了证明。杰·劳·柯林斯从华盛顿回到西贡后，就赞扬在南越对居民进行的恐怖行动和屠杀，以及对民主自由的绞杀行为。美帝国主义者和他们的追随者一直在策划并且加紧把北越人民强迫遣送或诱骗到南越去。他们一直在进行欺骗，要把公共机关的机器设备和公用事业的机构加以转移，用军事暴力强迫平民撤往南越，并且在关于移交海防地区的讨论中制造困难。他们用美国军事和财政援助来实现他们的增加南越军事力量的计划。这些军队是由美国将军奥丹尼尔训练的，而且事实上是由美帝国主义者指挥的，并且用来镇压南越的和平民主运动，企图阻挠越南的统一、实现他们把越南分裂为两部分的阴谋，把南越变成美国的一个殖民地和军事基地。
    召开目的在于加紧组成东南亚侵略集团并把南越、柬埔寨和老挝拉入这个集团之内的曼谷会议，以及美帝国主义者在南越的其他活动，是完全同日内瓦协定不相容的。这是同越南停止敌对行动协定第十六条关于禁止向越南运入一切增援部队和军事辅助人员的规定不相容的。这是同上述协定第十七条关于禁止运入一切增援的各种类型的武器、弹药和其他作战物资的规定不相容的。这也是同越南停止敌对行动协定第十九条和日内瓦会议最后宣言第五项不相容的。这两个条款规定：双方应注意，务使划归他们的地区不参加任何军事同盟，并不被用来恢复敌对行动或服务于侵略政策。
    作为日内瓦停战协定的一个签字国的法国政府，参加了马尼拉会议以后又参加曼谷会议，就必须对上述破坏停战协定的行为分担它的责任。英国的好战集团追随美帝国主义者，违反了英国人民的利益，并且受到亚洲各国人民和全世界人民的反对。
    越南人民和越南民主共和国政府一贯正确地和认真地履行着日内瓦停战协定。越南人民和越南民主共和国政府同亚洲国家的人民和政府一起，努力保卫和平，并且根据中印和中缅总理的联合声明中所提出的五项原则，积极地实现加强亚洲国家之间的友好的政策。
    因此，越南人民和越南民主共和国政府坚决反对曼谷会议，并且强烈抗议美帝国主义者的破坏日内瓦停战协定的活动。
    越南人民和越南民主共和国政府坚信，美帝国主义者的背信的阴谋注定要遭到失败，日内瓦停战协定一定会被严格地履行，他们的巩固和平、实现统一和在越南全境取得独立和民主的斗争一定会获得胜利。
    越南人民和越南民主共和国政府深信：亚洲各国人民和全世界人民将不会容忍美帝国主义者破坏和平的阴谋，并且将进一步紧密他们的队伍来反对和粉碎美帝国主义者利用亚洲人打亚洲人的诡计，以便维护亚洲和全世界的和平。
