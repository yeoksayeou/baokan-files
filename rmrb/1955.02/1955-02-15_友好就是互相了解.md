Friendship Means Mutual Understanding
Soviet Union, De·萨斯拉夫斯基

    Since we Soviet journalists returned from China, almost every day has been like this: early in the morning, the phone rings, and workers, engineers, college students, and actors invite us to attend their evening gatherings to talk about our experiences in China. We are currently holding local Soviet elections, and one of the most fascinating scenes at the election meetings is when China is mentioned.
    Recently, I, either alone or with my comrades, have given reports to the staff of “Pravda,” Moscow journalists, students of the Advanced Party School, university students, actors from the Moscow Art Theater, scholars, and workers in factories. If I were to include the places I declined due to lack of time, this list might double. When I speak of myself, I am also speaking of the other members of the delegation who are equally busy, those other Soviet people who were fortunate enough to visit China. Not long ago, I heard a conversation from an actress of the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theater. She spoke excitedly and emotionally about how well their theater was received by audiences in Beijing, about the talented Chinese youth, and about the Chinese children; you could see tears in the eyes of the listeners.
    When we give reports about China, we are surrounded by many questions, both written and oral. Soviet people want to know everything about their Chinese friends: every aspect of life in New China, the state of industrial growth, the achievements of socialist construction, and China's culture and science. The struggle to liberate Taiwan Island deeply moves the Soviet people, as if it were an island of their own homeland. When Soviet people read about the shameless conspiracies of the American imperialists in the newspapers, they recall the events of their own country's past. You see, when the Soviet state was first established and was still relatively weak, our enemies tried to seize Soviet territory, occupy the Crimean Peninsula, support their puppet Wrangel, and establish military bases in order to launch another offensive towards Moscow. At that time, the Soviet people were already a united people who had overthrown the landlords and capitalists. The Soviet state was the only country in the world that had established a government of workers and peasants. Of course, we had friends among the workers and peasants in many countries (including China). However, the entire international bourgeoisie, all capitalist countries, were against us, and at that time, we had no allies in any government.
    But in the end, the Soviet people were victorious, drove out the armed interventionists, and completely liberated their own land. For a long time after that, the American imperialists refused to recognize the Soviet Union, surrounded it with blockades, and carried out provocations. But this was of no use to them. They did not intimidate the Soviet people. Finally, they had to recognize the Soviet Socialist State as a great power, without which no international problem could be solved. The imperialists did not learn this lesson. They are repeating actions that failed once before and will now suffer an even more shameful defeat. They are again trying to plunder a part of the Chinese people's territory by banditry. They are again establishing military bases against all of China, they are again "not recognizing," again imposing blockades, and carrying out provocations against great, free China. China is no longer isolated among the countries and governments of the world. Its loyal friend, the Soviet Union, is by its side, and the friendly family of people's democratic countries is with it. The international proletariat and all peace-loving people are supporting it and sympathizing with it. China's struggle for its independence, sovereignty, and territory is the common struggle of all progressive humanity in the world.
    Soviet people love China, so they want to know more about China. The need for Chinese books and books about China is particularly great and is constantly growing. This can be proven by the names and titles of the books I have written. However, this is not at all a dry and boring list, nor is it an ordinary bibliography. In the library or in the bookstore, there is not a single book lover who does not enjoy browsing through one book after another. I also browse through books and magazines, these books and magazines tell me about New China, about the Soviet people who want to know China.
    In the recent months alone, several books introducing China have been published: the thick reference book about China "China" (464 pages) published by the Soviet Encyclopedia, the economic research work "The Commercial Development of the People's Republic of China" (114 pages) by V.I. Gogol, the Russian version of the "Collection of Documents of the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China," and separate editions of Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" and Liu Shaoqi's "Report on the Draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China."
    In the popular booklet by Yu.V. Arutyunyan, it was mentioned the unbreakable friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China, as a strong bastion for defending world peace.
    Chinese literary works not only arouse our interest in literature and aesthetics, but also arouse our desire for knowledge. The life of New China, especially those most valuable aspects, the struggle between the new and the old, decadent things, is presented to us through these literary works.
    However, by no means have all old things been eliminated. On the contrary, the realism and importance of the greatest works of Chinese national culture today are no less than they were thousands of years ago. We know how rich China's ancient civilization is, and how great the treasury of ideas and art created by those ancient geniuses.
    For example, we read with great interest the famous "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," which was published in two volumes, each with 792 pages. The Soviet Academy of Sciences has translated a part of "Stories Old and New" into Russian. The first volume of Lu Xun's selected works has also been published. Before this, many editions of his short stories had been published.
    In the recent months alone, a large number of Russian translations of the works of modern Chinese writers such as Mao Dun, Lao She, Ding Ling, and Zhao Shuli have appeared in bookstores. The State Literature Publishing House alone is preparing to publish a large number of books in 1955. Among them, in terms of classical works, include Sima Qian's works, selected works of Pu Songling, a collection of Du Fu's poems; among modern writers, there is a two-volume collection of Guo Moruo's selected works, a collection of Lao She's short stories, dramas, and prose. Collections of short stories by Ding Ling, Ye Shengtao, Ba Jin, and Zhang Tianyi, with a circulation of 200,000 copies, have been published.
    All these books are excellent and precious. I happened to browse through our literary magazine "New World," which published some ancient Chinese poems, Li Zhun's novel "Can't Take That Road," and Ding Ling's essay "On Literature and Writers" last year.
    Fedin narrates his meeting with Chinese writers. Kapitsa comments on a book about the youth of New China, and Stadnichenko introduces the "Geography of New China" compiled by Chu Shaotang to Soviet readers. K. Ardens discusses the relationship between the Chinese intellectual community and the great Russian writer Leo Tolstoy based on materials selected by Chinese researchers. Le. Delyusin talks about his impressions of New China in his essay "New China is a Great Power."
    Let's take a look at the scientific magazine published by the Soviet Academy of Sciences. This magazine has a wide readership. Its name is "Nature." Many of its articles discuss the scientific work of the academies and institutes of science in New China. Ch. M. Burmkina talks about the work of the Institute of Modern Physics, V.T. Zaichikov discusses Chinese geographical science, and Kozubov and Parnomenko talk about the first congress of the Chinese Geographical Society. A.V. Neiking reported on new work in the chemical industry, and Yan Zhixian discussed the contributions of Chinese scientists to the development of inorganic chemistry.
    What we have talked about is only a small part of the books and literary works about China, and it is not at all to illustrate how much we have written and published about China. We believe that, on the contrary, if we understand the requirements of our readers, we will feel that what has been written and published is very insufficient; but even from this cursory inspection, it can be seen how wide-ranging the interests of Soviet readers are, and how much they want to know. The source of this thirst for knowledge, this concern for everything that happens in China, is the deep and unbreakable friendship.

    友好就是互相了解
    苏联　德·萨斯拉夫斯基
    自从我们苏联新闻工作者，从中国回来的时候起，差不多每天都是这样：一清早，电话铃就响起来，工人、工程师、大学生、演员，都邀请我们出席他们的晚会，谈谈在中国的见闻。我们这里现在正在举行地方苏维埃选举，在选举大会上最引人入胜的场面之一，就是当谈到中国的时候。
    近来，我一个人或者同我的同志们一起，曾向
  “真理报”的工作人员，莫斯科的新闻工作者，高级党校的学员，大学生们，莫斯科艺术剧院的演员，学者们，工厂里的工人们做报告。如果把我由于抽不出时间而谢绝了的那些地方也算上，这个名单可能还要增加一倍。当我提到我自己的时候，说的也就是那些同样是忙得不可开交的代表团的其他团员，也就是其他有幸访问中国的苏联人。不久以前，我听了斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基和聂米罗维奇—丹钦科音乐剧院一位女演员的谈话。她兴奋地、感动地谈到他们的剧院在北京多么受到观众的欢迎，谈到多才多艺的中国青年，谈到中国的儿童们，你可以在听众的眼睛里看到眼泪。
    当我们作关于中国的报告的时候，我们被书面和口头提出的许多问题包围起来了。苏联人想知道中国友人的一切：新中国生活的各个方面，工业增长的情形，社会主义建设的成就，以及中国的文化和科学。争取解放台湾岛的斗争使苏联人非常激动，就像对自己祖国的岛屿那样。苏联人在报纸上读到关于美帝国主义者的无耻的阴谋诡计时，就回想起自己祖国的往事。要知道，当苏维埃国家初初建立，还比较弱的时候，我们的敌人曾经企图劫夺苏联的土地，盘踞在克里木半岛，扶植他们所豢养的傀儡弗兰格尔，建立军事基地，以便重新向莫斯科进攻。当时，苏联人民已经是推翻了地主和资本家的政权的团结一致的人民。苏维埃国家是世界上建立了工人和农民政权的唯一的国家。固然，我们在许多国家（其中包括中国）的工人和农民中间有朋友。然而，所有的国际资产阶级，所有的资本主义国家都反对我们，而且当时在各国政府中，我们没有一个同盟者。
    但当时苏联人民毕竟是胜利了，驱逐了武装干涉者，完全解放了自己的土地。此后很长时期美帝国主义分子不愿意承认苏联，用封锁来包围它，进行挑衅。但是，这对他们是无济于事的。他们没有吓唬住苏联人民。最后只好承认苏维埃社会主义国家是一个伟大的强国，没有苏联就不可能解决任何一个国际问题。帝国主义分子没有接受这一教训。他们又在重复曾经失败过一回、而现在将遭到更大的可耻的失败的行动。他们又企图用土匪的手段来掠夺中国人民手里的一部分领土。他们又在建立反对全中国的军事基地，他们又“不承认”，又实行封锁，并向伟大自由的中国进行挑衅。中国在世界各国和政府中已经不是孤立的了。它的忠实的朋友苏联在它的旁边，各人民民主国家的友好大家庭同它在一起。国际无产阶级和一切爱好和平的人们都在支持它，同情它。中国为自己的独立，主权和领土而进行的斗争，是全世界进步人类的共同斗争。
    苏维埃人热爱中国，因此想知道更多的关于中国的事情，关于中国的书籍和中国书籍的需要特别多，并且不断地在增长着。这可以从我写的书名和标题中得到证明。不过，这完全不是枯燥乏味的一览表，也不是普通的书目。在图书馆或是在书店里，没有一个爱好书的人不是喜爱地一本又一本地浏览着。我也翻阅着书籍和杂志，这些书籍和杂志告诉我关于新中国、关于想认识中国的苏维埃人的事情。
    仅在近数月内就出版了介绍中国的一些书：苏联大百科全书所出的很厚的关于中国的参考书“中国”（四六四页），出版了经济研究著作，弗·伊·果戈理著的中华人民共和国的商业发展（一一四页），出版了俄文版的中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议文件集，以及周恩来的
  “政府工作报告”和刘少奇的“关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告”的单行本。
    在尤·弗·阿儒丘扬的通俗小册子里曾说到作为保卫世界和平的坚强堡垒的苏中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊。
    中国的文艺作品不仅引起我们在文艺和美学上的兴趣，而且也引起我们的求知欲望。新中国的生活，特别是其中那些最宝贵的，新事物同旧的腐朽的事物的斗争，通过这些文学作品，展现在我们面前。
    但是，也绝不是所有旧的东西都已被淘汰了。恰恰相反，今天中国民族文化的最伟大作品所具有的现实性和重要性是并不亚于数千年以前的，我们知道，中国有着多么丰富的古老的文明，那些古代的天才大师们创造了多么伟大的思想和艺术的宝库。
    例如，我们抱着很大的兴趣读了有名的“三国演义”，这部书分两卷出版，每本页数七九二页。苏联科学院已把“今古奇观”的一部分译成俄文。鲁迅选集第一卷也已出版。在这以前，他的一些短篇小说已出了好多版。
    仅在近数月内，在各书店中就出现了中国的现代作家如茅盾、老舍、丁玲、赵树理等的创作的大量俄译本。仅是国家文学出版社就准备在一九五五年内出版大量书籍。其中在古典作品方面包括司马迁的著作，蒲松龄选集，杜甫的诗集，在现代作家中，有郭沫若选集两卷集，老舍的短篇小说集、戏剧、散文。丁玲、叶圣陶、巴金、张天翼的短篇小说集，其发行量达到了二十万册。
    所有这些书都是优秀而珍贵的。我偶然地浏览了一下我们的文学杂志“新世界”，“新世界”在去年一年中发表了一些中国的古诗、李准的小说“不能走那一条路”、丁玲的论文“论文学和作家”。
    费德林叙述他和中国作家的会晤。卡皮查评论一本关于新中国青年的书，而斯塔德尼秦科，他把褚绍唐编著的“新中国地理”介绍给苏联读者。科·阿尔定斯根据中国研究者所选的材料来论述中国知识界和伟大的俄国作家列夫·托尔斯泰的关系。勒·杰柳辛在他的论文“新中国是伟大的强国”中谈述他对新中国的观感。
    我们再来看一看苏联科学院出版的科学杂志吧。这本杂志是拥有广大的读者的。它的名字叫
  “自然”。其中许多文章都是谈新中国的科学院和研究所的科学工作的。契·姆·布尔姆基娜谈述现代物理研究所的工作，伏·特·扎依奇科夫论中国的地理科学，科祖包夫和帕尔诺敏科谈述中国地理学会第一次代表大会的情况。阿·夫·涅依金格报道了化工方面的新工作，严志弦论中国科学家在无机化学发展方面的贡献。
    我们所谈到的仅是有关中国的一小部分书籍和文学作品，而且完全不是为了说明我们关于中国写了和发表了多少文章。我们认为，相反地，假如了解一下我们读者的要求，那就会感到所写的和所发表的是非常不够的；但是即使从这一草草的巡视中也可以看出，苏联读者的兴趣是多么广泛，他们想要知道的是多么的多。这种对知识的渴望，这种对中国所发生的一切事物的关心的源泉，就是深厚的牢不可破的友谊。
