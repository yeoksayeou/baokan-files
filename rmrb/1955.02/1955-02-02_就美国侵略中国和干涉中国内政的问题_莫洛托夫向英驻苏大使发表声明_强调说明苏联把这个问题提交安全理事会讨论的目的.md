(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 31st) TASS, Moscow, January 31st: The Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following communique:

Following the meeting between Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov and British Ambassador Sir Hayter on January 28th, V.M. Molotov invited the British Ambassador on January 31st and made the following statement:

Mr. Ambassador, during our meeting on January 28th, you expressed the British government's and the New Zealand government's attitude towards the situation in the Taiwan area. Immediately after the meeting, the Soviet government informed the government of the People's Republic of China of your views on this issue.

The Soviet government, like the British government, is concerned about the serious situation developing in Taiwan and other Chinese coastal islands. This existing situation is endangering the maintenance of peace and increasing the danger of a new war.

The Soviet government believes that the reason for this situation is that the United States, with the help of Chiang Kai-shek, has for several years occupied Taiwan Island, the Penghu Islands, and other Chinese islands, which belong to China. Recently, the United States has taken new aggressive actions in that region, which has further aggravated the tense situation. The Soviet government agrees with the British government's view that this issue needs to be discussed comprehensively in the United Nations Security Council. The Soviet government has issued corresponding instructions to the Soviet representative to the United Nations, Ambassador A.Y. Sobolev. In addition, the Soviet government has also instructed him that, for the purpose of discussing this issue, a delegation from the People's Republic of China should be invited to participate, since this is an issue of aggression against China and interference in China's internal affairs by the United States of America, the participation of the delegation from the People's Republic of China is therefore particularly necessary. The Soviet government would like to emphasize that the purpose of submitting this issue to the Security Council for discussion is to ease the tension in the Far East and promote the consolidation of world peace.

After hearing the above statement by V.M. Molotov, British Ambassador Sir Hayter said that he would inform the British government of this statement.

    就美国侵略中国和干涉中国内政的问题
    莫洛托夫向英驻苏大使发表声明
    强调说明苏联把这个问题提交安全理事会讨论的目的
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科一月三十一日电：苏联外交部发表公报如下：
    苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫同英国大使海特尔先生在一月二十八日举行会谈之后，维·米·莫洛托夫在一月三十一日邀见了英国大使，并且作了下面的声明：
    大使先生，您在一月二十八日我们会谈时表明了英国政府和新西兰政府对台湾地区发生的局势所抱的态度，会谈之后苏联政府立即把您对这个问题所表示的看法通知了中华人民共和国政府。
    苏联政府同英国政府一样，对于在台湾以及其他中国沿海岛屿地区发展的严重局势感到不安。这种现存的局势正在危及和平的维持，加深新战争的危险。
    苏联政府认为，造成在那里发生的这种局势的原因是美国在蒋介石的帮助下，几年前就霸占了属于中国的台湾岛、澎湖列岛和中国其他一些岛屿。最近美国又在那个地区采取了新的侵略行动，这就更加加剧了紧张局势。苏联政府同意英国政府这种看法：需要把这个问题通盘地在联合国安全理事会加以讨论。苏联政府已经向苏联驻联合国代表阿·亚·索波列夫大使发出相应的指示。此外，苏联政府还向他发出这样的指示：为了讨论这个问题，应该邀请中华人民共和国代表团参加，由于这是一个美利坚合众国对中国的侵略行为和干涉中国内政的问题，中华人民共和国代表团的参加因此尤其必要。苏联政府要强调说明，它把这个问题提交安全理事会讨论的目的是希望缓和远东的紧张局势和促进世界和平的巩固。英国大使海特尔先生听了维·米·莫洛托夫的上
  述声明之后说道，他将把这一个声明通知英国政府。
