Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd:

    A group of Chinese students who have recently returned from studying in the United States have successively participated in national construction work. Some students are currently having their work arranged by the state, based on needs and in consideration of their aspirations and expertise.
    After October 1954, Mao Hanli, Song Zhenyu, Liang Xiaotian, and Fan Xinbi, who returned to the country and reported to the Ministry of Higher Education in Beijing, have happily taken up their work posts. Mao Hanli and Fan Xinbi have joined the Chinese Academy of Sciences to engage in research work. Liang Xiaotian and Song Zhenyu have joined the Central Institute of Hygiene. The remaining students are having their work arranged by personnel departments and relevant units. Some students are taking advantage of the Spring Festival holiday to return to their hometowns to visit their families they have been separated from for a long time, and then come to Beijing to accept work assignments.

    回国留美学生参加建设工作
   【新华社二日讯】在最近几个月回国的一批我国留美学生已先后参加国家建设工作，部分留学生正在由国家根据需要结合他们的志愿和专长来安排他们的工作。
    在一九五四年十月以后，回国到达北京并向高等教育部报到的毛汉礼、宋振玉、梁晓天、范新弼等都已经愉快地走上了工作岗位。毛汉礼和范新弼已进入中国科学院从事研究工作。梁晓天和宋振玉已参加中央卫生研究院工作。其余留学生正由人事部门和有关单位安排他们的工作。有一部分留学生趁春节假期，先回乡探视他们离别已久的家人，然后再来北京接受分配工作。
