Strengthen the Forces of Peace, Smash the Threat of Atomic War!
—Report at the Joint Expanded Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Standing Committee of the China Peace Committee

(I) The Forces of Peace are Growing Ever Stronger

We can summarize the current international situation with one sentence: the forces of aggression and war are becoming increasingly rampant and dangerous, but the forces of peace are stronger than the forces of aggression and war.

The core of the forces of peace—the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the Soviet Union—has achieved solid successes in all aspects of construction due to the superiority of its system. The fraternal friendship of 900 million people is unbreakable, unity is increasingly consolidated, and selfless mutual assistance and cooperation are increasingly developed. The consistent peace policy has gained increasing recognition and support from peace-loving people all over the world. All of this has further expanded the foundation of the peace movement, leading to significant and major achievements in the cause of defending world peace.

Taking 1954 as an example, the achievements of the peace cause, in Europe, we saw the bankruptcy of the "European Army" plan, we saw the French Laniel government, which followed the American policy of aggression, being liquidated by the French people, and we saw the vigorous development of the struggle of the people of Western European countries against the Paris Agreements. In Asia, we saw the success of the Geneva Conference, which, although mainly discussing Asian issues, was closely related to world peace; we saw the restoration of peace in Indochina after the Korean armistice; we saw the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence proposed successively in the joint statements of China and India and China and Burma being increasingly supported by the people of Asian countries, and the successive visits to China by Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Burmese Prime Minister U Nu further developing the friendly relations between China and India and China and Burma; we saw the joint declaration of the Chinese and Soviet governments, especially the appeal to the Japanese people based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence for the restoration of normal relations, which encouraged the Japanese people's will for peace, and the Yoshida government, which followed the American policy of aggression, thus collapsed.

Since the end of World War II, American imperialism has inherited the mantle of fascism, attempting to dominate the world and enslave the people of the world. Although capitalism is on its way to extinction, it relies solely on war policies, on war preparations and promotion, to extract large amounts of war profits to maintain a temporary, disguised prosperity. The continuous achievements of the peace cause are, without a doubt, the gradual bankruptcy of the war policy pursued by the American imperialists. Especially during the Geneva Conference, the American warmongers constantly cried out: the United States is in an unprecedentedly isolated position in international affairs. In this atmosphere of panic, the American warmongers and their followers have taken a series of reactionary measures, attempting to continue to create a tense international situation.

In Europe, they formulated the unpopular London and Paris Agreements, wanting to rapidly arm West Germany; especially in mid-December 1954, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization met in Paris, and after two days of meetings, the responsible representatives of the governments openly agreed to prepare for atomic war, adopting a further sinister policy of atomic blackmail against the people of Europe and the world.

In Asia, the American warmongers are doing their utmost to obstruct the further peaceful resolution of the Korean issue; they are constantly expressing their intention and actions to sabotage peace in Indochina; in early September, they gathered Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Thailand, Pakistan and other countries in Manila to conclude the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" aimed at maintaining colonial rule and undermining the Geneva Accords; in December, they concluded the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, further antagonizing the Chinese people.

This series of reactionary measures against the will of the people is undoubtedly a serious threat to world peace and human happiness, which has gradually shifted the once-easing international situation toward tension again.

(II) Taiwan Must Be Liberated

This year, the Chinese people victoriously liberated Yijiangshan Island in the struggle to liberate Taiwan. The American government became even more panicked, and thus even more rampant.

On January 24, US President Eisenhower submitted a "special message" to the US Congress, requesting that he be granted the power to "use US armed forces when necessary to ensure the security of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands." The US Congress passed his proposal. Thus, the US armed forces, which had been protecting the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group since June 1950, have even more blatantly engaged in war provocations against us.

However, the American government is adopting a two-faced policy. On the one hand, it is baring its fangs and claws to threaten us with war, while on the other hand, it is colluding with its vassal states, Britain and New Zealand, to use the guise of "peace" to lure and deceive world opinion.

On January 31, the New Zealand representative to the United Nations openly proposed a suggestion to the United Nations: to demand a "ceasefire" in the Taiwan Strait between the Chinese people and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group. The United Nations Security Council hastily passed this suggestion and invited me to send a representative to participate in the discussion.

This suggestion by New Zealand is entirely to serve the American policy of aggression. It does not mention a word about the American occupation of Taiwan, the stationing of troops in the Taiwan Strait, which constitutes the fundamental cause of the tense situation in the Far East, but arrogantly interferes in my country's internal affairs in violation of the UN Charter.

Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the UN Charter clearly stipulates: "Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter."

Taiwan and other islands are Chinese territory, and the Chinese people want to liberate the territory occupied by traitors under the protection of foreign forces, which is entirely a matter "essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state." The New Zealand representative, under the instructions of the United States, "submitting such matters to settlement" is a violation of the Charter; and the United Nations accepting this proposal and openly interfering in my country's internal affairs is also a violation of the Charter.

What is even more noteworthy is that on January 30, before the New Zealand proposal was submitted, the Soviet Union, which has always upheld justice, through its representative to the United Nations, Sobolev, had already submitted a reasonable proposal to the United Nations: The United States government should immediately take steps to end its acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China and its interference in China's internal affairs in the area of ​​Taiwan and other islands of China, and withdraw all US naval, land, and air forces from Taiwan and all other territories belonging to China; in order to facilitate the withdrawal of all armed forces that do not belong to the People's Republic of China, appeal to any party to prevent military operations in the Taiwan area.

The Soviet proposal correctly stated the essence of the Taiwan issue. However, under the manipulation of the United States and Britain, the Security Council suppressed it and discussed it after the New Zealand proposal. This is another proof before the people of the world: the United Nations is nothing more than a tool manipulated by the American aggressive bloc.

The United Nations Security Council passed New Zealand's illegal proposal so quickly and immediately extended an invitation to me. What is its purpose? It is nothing more than to lure me into the trap set by American imperialism and its vassal states. They fully believed that the Chinese people would be intimidated by the American war threat and would rashly send representatives to participate in the discussion of New Zealand's illegal proposal. They have done their best to induce us. If we rashly went to participate, it would in fact be tantamount to admitting that the Taiwan issue is not my country's internal affair, admitting that Taiwan and other islands are protectorates of the United States, and admitting that there are indeed "two Chinas."

American imperialism and its shameful followers, they have completely mistaken their target. The battle-hardened, standing-up Chinese people will neither be intimidated by any war threats nor be deceived by any deceptive tactics.

We fully support Premier Zhou Enlai's reply to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on February 3, sternly refuting the illegal proposal of the New Zealand representative and refusing to send representatives to participate in the discussion. "Only when the representatives of the People's Republic of China attend the Security Council's discussions in order to discuss the Soviet proposal and expel the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek group from the Security Council to represent China can the People's Republic of China agree to send representatives to participate in the Security Council's discussions."

Premier Zhou Enlai once again clearly stated: "The tense situation in the Taiwan region is caused by the American occupation of Taiwan and interference in China's internal affairs. All genuine efforts in the international community to ease and eliminate the tension caused by the United States in this region and other regions of the Far East will be supported by the People's Republic of China."

This is completely the common will of our 600 million Chinese people.

We Chinese people love peace, but we will never sacrifice our territorial sovereignty to beg for peace from aggressors.

We Chinese people are against war, but if the aggressors dare to use force to invade us, in order to defend the security of our motherland and peace in the Far East, we must resist to the end, and we will never give up until we win.

Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. All the armed forces of American imperialism must withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait! Any attempt to divide China's territory and create "two Chinas," the so-called "neutralization of Taiwan," the so-called "trusteeship," the so-called "undetermined sovereignty," are absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people.

(III) We Are By No Means Isolated

The tyranny and recklessness of the American imperialists have reached an unprecedented stage today.

They have proclaimed themselves the protectors of the so-called "free world." They freely regard the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans as American inland seas, freely violate the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of other countries, deploy military bases and station military personnel in other countries, and monopolize their military resources; freely trample on international agreements, organize military blocs, and provoke national hatred; freely impose blockades and embargoes on socialist and people's democratic countries, and openly clamor to "liberate" the people of socialist and people's democratic countries; freely distort right and wrong, calling the defense of their independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity by other nations "aggression," and calling their own aggression "defense"...

Their "freedom" is truly unlimited, but we want to declare to the world once again: We Chinese people can never allow the American imperialists to have the "freedom" to "protect" our sacred territory of Taiwan and other islands.

The sacred struggle of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan has received the universal support of peace-loving and justice-upholding people all over the world.

We thank the Indian people. On February 6, they held a "Withdraw from Taiwan Day" throughout the country, demanding that the United States withdraw its armed forces from the Taiwan Strait and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.

We thank the Soviet government. Marshal Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, clearly stated in his speech to the Supreme Soviet on February 9 that our Chinese people's "this noble cause" will receive "the assistance of the great Soviet people."

We thank the peace-loving working people and justice-upholding people all over the world, they are all our friendly forces, and we are by no means isolated.

At the same time, we also clearly know that it is by no means the will of the American people for the American warmongers to be 11,000 kilometers away from their country, to station troops in the Taiwan Strait, and to carry out war provocations.

The American people are against war.

We have not forgotten that more than two years ago, Eisenhower won the majority of American votes and came to power by calling for an end to the Korean War. During his tenure, according to the Crossley poll, the Korean armistice was the only popular achievement (according to the "Boston Post" published in the May issue of "US News").

Before peace was restored in Indochina, on the eve of the Geneva Conference, some people in the US government actively advocated participating in the war, but at that time, of the letters from the people received by the US Congress, 90% opposed participation. In the Gallup poll in March last year, 85% opposed participation, 8% supported it, and 7% were neutral. The ratio of opposition to support is greater than 10 to 1.

Based on these past facts, we can conclude that the American government's intention to fight China today to protect the Chiang Kai-shek group, that is, to start another world war, the American people, who even oppose limited-battlefield wars, will never agree.

No matter how great Eisenhower and his staff's abilities are, they cannot mobilize their own people with aggressive wars, let alone change the anti-war will of the vast majority of people in a short period of time.

It can be seen from this that the majority support of the US Senate and House of Representatives for Eisenhower's "special message" is just a false majority. Those congressmen represent only the bloody profits of a few American capitalists, not the good will of the American people.

The American people are against war, and the vassal states of the United States are even more afraid of war, and the American warmongers also clearly know this. Therefore, in order to realize their war policy, they have long wanted to use Asians to fight Asians and Europeans to fight Europeans, and they have long been deliberately planning to actively arm Japan and West Germany. However, such conspiracies have not been going so smoothly so far.

In West Germany, the German people are against the London and Paris Agreements and firmly oppose rearmament. An article was published in the November 26 issue of "US News & World Report" entitled "Can Germany Produce an Army?" The information revealed in it is that "tens of thousands of young Germans who have reached military age are unwilling to join any new German army... In many cases, they are supported by their fathers—who fought for Germany in one or two world wars." It also said: "A printing union in Dusseldorf recently suggested that its members refuse to print conscription notices."

This anti-war will of the peace-loving German people is also clearly reflected in the proposals of the West German Social Democratic Party. The leader of the West German Social Democratic Party, Ollenhauer, delivered a radio speech on January 25, opposing the London and Paris Agreements and advocating talks with the Soviet Union to reunify Germany. They believe that "the most urgent goal of German policy will be to overcome Germany's unpleasant division."

The unpopular London and Paris Agreements, after great twists and turns in the French National Assembly, were passed by only a slight majority, but before the discussions in the Senate of the Republic, the Mendes-France government, which actively supported this agreement, was liquidated by the French people following the Laniel government.

This agreement has only passed the first reading in the West German parliament, but due to the opposition of the German people and the influence of the change of the French government, it seems difficult to be sure of passing the second and third readings. Even if an agreement that the people are unwilling to support is passed in parliament, what binding force will it have?

In Japan, the central demand of the Japanese people is to strive for national independence and get rid of American control. The liquidation of the Yoshida government, which has been in power for six years and has wholeheartedly followed American policies, is the most vivid expression of the Japanese people's opposition to American policies.

In August 1945, when World War II was about to end on the Eastern battlefield, the US government, with completely different intentions, dropped the only two atomic bombs it had at the time on the peaceful citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, massacring a large number of innocent Japanese people. About a year ago, the US government tested a hydrogen bomb on Bikini Island, and the Japanese people directly suffered the impact of the disaster.

Due to such historical relations, the Japanese people are firmly opposed to atomic and hydrogen weapons. On January 16, the Japanese people held a conference in Tokyo to oppose atomic and hydrogen weapons. They have taken the lead in launching a signature campaign against the threat of atomic war and have collected 22 million signatures.

West Germany and Japan are the players that the American warmongers expect to launch another war. However, the actual situation is like this, not to mention that West Germany and Japan have not yet been fully armed today, even if they are fully armed, who has such great ability to mobilize the peace-loving West German and Japanese people to shed blood for the interests of American capitalists?

We Chinese people are by no means isolated. We have sufficient strength to resist aggression, and we also have sufficient backing to win the war.

The people are against war, but the result of war must be the victory of the people.

(IV) The Balance of Power Between War and Peace

The American imperialists should not be so forgetful, right?

Only a little more than five years ago, they spent a capital of 6 billion US dollars and used the army of 8 million people of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group to oppose the Chinese people, but what was the result?

The experience on the Korean battlefield, the "heartbreak" on "Heartbreak Ridge," should still be fresh, right?

In May last year, there was an article by Chester Bowles in "Harper's" magazine, "A Bipartisan Policy on American Problems in Asia," which contained the following passage:

"In the limited battlefield of Korea, 400,000 battle-hardened American and United Nations troops, plus 600,000 South Korean troops, with air supremacy and protected on both flanks by American warships, have not achieved a decisive victory. So how can we expect an army of the Chinese Kuomintang that is less than half the size of the above (average age 29) to defeat the Chinese Red Army? Even with the support of our air force and navy. Japan's experience in the 1930s should make us think twice before considering this risky action."

Yes, the result of the Japanese warlords launching the war of aggression against China is indeed a valuable lesson for the American generals. Even if they are unwilling to think about this lesson, it is hoped that they will recall the situation at the end of the Korean War. In the summer of 1953, in the counterattack south of Jinzhou, the Korean and Chinese People's Forces so strongly defeated four or more divisions of the Lee Seung-man army equipped by the United States, forcing the American generals to stop the Korean War. Please ruminate on this fresh history!

The American generals know the strength of the Soviet Union, our great ally, the strongest fortress of defending world peace, even more clearly. They have long known that the Soviet Union already has atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and the Soviet Union also already has long-range jet heavy bombers.

However, Soviet weapons are only manufactured as defensive weapons. The Soviet Union will never use such massively destructive weapons to preemptively strike, nor will it use these weapons to threaten anyone, but rather constantly make just appeals: ban these weapons, destroy these weapons.

The American generals and war criminal candidates who are obsessed with atomic weapons should know that using atomic weapons for blackmail cannot scare others but can only scare themselves. The manufacture of this weapon has long been out of the stage of American monopoly. If they use it, they cannot but consider others' retaliation against them. Marshal Bulganin once said on July 22 last year: "If anyone dares to use atomic weapons, the Soviet Union will retaliate ten for one." Four days ago, on February 8, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also clearly announced in his report to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: "The Soviet Union has made such achievements in the manufacture of hydrogen weapons that it is not the Soviet Union that is lagging behind, but the United States of America." This is a wake-up call for the atomic maniacs.

The Soviet Union and China have vast territories and low population densities. The industrial areas of the Soviet Union are planned and dispersed, and China's industrialization is just beginning. Therefore, massively destructive weapons are not so harmful to us. But in the United States and Britain, France, and other countries, the situation is completely different. Taking the United States as an example, the industrial areas are biased in the north, and 65% of the industry is concentrated in an area that accounts for 9% of the country's area. Under such circumstances, if it is subjected to retaliation with atomic weapons, it will suffer extremely heavy blows. Therefore, the atomic blackmail policy of the American fanatics cannot but scare themselves first.

Although the atomic fanatics are willing to destroy themselves, the people are unwilling to be destroyed. The peace-loving working people all over the world have long been prepared to declare some atomic fanatics as the top war criminals!

(V) Sincere Gratitude to the Soviet Union

Here, we cannot but express our sincere gratitude to the great ally, the Soviet Union, in particular.

The great ally, the Soviet Union, is the strongest fortress of peace.

Due to the superiority of the socialist system, the unity and concerted efforts of the Soviet people, and the organized and planned creative research of Soviet scientists under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, the Soviet Union not only already has atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, preventing the reckless actions of atomic fanatics, but also built an atomic energy industrial power station, the "Atomic Energy Power Station of the Soviet Academy of Sciences," on June 27 last year, winning a glorious leading position in the cause of serving peaceful construction with atomic energy, a raw power with massive productive capacity.

In 1945, when atomic energy began to be controlled and utilized, the progressive scientists at that time had long predicted that atomic energy would be used for peaceful production within ten years, and the Soviet Union would inevitably take the lead. This scientific prediction was completely correct. The socialist Soviet Union, which conducts production, construction, and other construction on a national scale in a planned way, has a large-scale production structure that is suitable for using such a large production force as atomic energy. In capitalist countries, due to the limitations of the system, they cannot but lag far behind in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

The United States also forms a contrast with the Soviet Union in the use of atomic energy. The US government only uses atomic energy for the manufacture of weapons that kill a large number of people. Although the monopoly of this weapon has long been lost, it is still stepping up production and still stepping up its blackmail policy, constantly testing atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, constantly making hysterical cries, and colluding with its vassal states to openly agree to wage atomic war. The more the American atomic fanatics feel panicked in the face of the forces of peace, the more rampantly they carry out atomic blackmail. But when will the United States be able to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes? Here is a very interesting question and answer.

The December 17 issue of "US News & World Report" contained a conversation with Strauss, Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission of the US government. Someone asked him: "How long will it take for atomic energy to be used for peaceful purposes?" His reply was: "If we don't have a war, I believe it will take ten to twenty years. I may be overly optimistic, but this is my guess."

This should be Mr. Strauss's honest words, but we can say with certainty that his "guess" of "ten to twenty years" is indeed "overly optimistic." The same issue of "US News & World Report" also contained a conversation with Robert E. Wilson, a chemical expert at a gasoline company. He was more honest. He believes that it will take ten to twenty-five years for atomic energy to be used in peaceful industry. He said that the main reason is that the main force of the US government today is placed on the research of atomic energy for military purposes, and it does not pay attention to peaceful uses. Private commercial companies are unwilling to spend such a large amount of capital on research, and it is unprofitable, and no one is willing to actively carry out research.

This is an extremely vivid reflection of the struggle between peace and war—these two routes—in the use of atomic energy.

The Soviet Union has atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, but it advocates destroying them and concentrating its efforts on the peaceful use of atomic energy. Although the Soviet Union has taken the lead in controlling atomic energy to serve peaceful purposes, it does not want to monopolize it, and it is prepared to make the technology public and report it at international conferences. On January 17, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union issued a statement: The People's Republic of China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and the German Democratic Republic were given experimental atomic piles with 5,000 kilowatts of heat energy and equipment for atomic particle accelerators, and assistance was provided in research technology. The Soviet government is also further considering expanding the scope of countries it can assist.

What about the US government? On the other hand, while stepping up atomic blackmail, it has not forgotten to use the peaceful use of atomic energy as its guise. According to the December 3 issue of "US News & World Report": Eisenhower promised to send 220 pounds of uranium for the world's peaceful atomic energy research. It is said that this amount of uranium can make eleven atomic bombs, which is 24 times the price of gold—these standards of calculation are really in line with the American attitude of holding gold coins in one hand and atomic weapons in the other. But this raw material is said not to be sent to one country, but to be distributed to many countries: the countries that accept the raw materials must sign a security treaty with the United States, and it will take a year to complete the signing procedures. Also, the countries that have accepted the raw materials have to build research institutions and master the technology themselves, and the United States does not care about the research equipment and technology.

It is said that "this is a great gift from the United States to peace," which is really laughable! The US government's "great gift"—the uranium material of "eleven atomic bombs" will be given to the recipient countries a year later, allowing them to explore the technology of peaceful use of atomic energy on their own—in fact, the United States does not have such experience, but on January 29 this year, the Atomic Energy Commission of the US government submitted a report to the US Congress: it will conduct eight to twelve atomic explosions in February. Isn't this another time to tear off its own mask? After all, atomic blackmail is the basic policy, and atomic alms are just a guise of peace.

(VI) Increasing the Proportion of the Forces of Peace

However, the mental state of the warmongers is approaching the stage of madness. Their theories and actions cannot be regulated by general logic. Therefore, we cannot overestimate the strength of the enemy, nor can we underestimate the strength of the enemy. We must not be careless or blindly optimistic. We must redouble our vigilance, be on guard against unexpected sudden events, and be on guard against the "desperate moves" of the enemies of peace.

We must be prepared, and we must constantly increase the proportion of the forces of peace to smash any rampant actions that the enemies of peace may have. Defending the security and territorial integrity of the country and defending peace in Asia and the world is a long-term struggle, and we must strengthen unity, never slacken, to win the final victory.

At present, an important bill of ours—the "Draft Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China"—has been issued by the State Council to people's committees at all levels for discussion and to solicit opinions from the people. This is an excellent opportunity for all our Chinese people, especially young people who have reached the age of eighteen, to express our strong will to strengthen the forces of peace. We must fully support this important bill and ensure that it must be passed at the next session of the National People's Congress and implemented as soon as possible.

The matter is very clear. If we want to defend peace in Asia and the world, we must resist the forces of aggression. If we want to ensure the security of our motherland, we must consolidate national defense construction. If we want to liberate Taiwan and other islands, we must drive out all the armed forces of the aggressors. If we want to build our motherland into a great socialist country, we must not only defend against external enemies, but also guard against possible internal enemies. Therefore, our constitution already has a clear provision in Article 103:

"It is the sacred duty of every citizen of the People's Republic of China to defend the motherland. It is the glorious obligation of citizens of the People's Republic of China to perform military service in accordance with the law."

Our motherland, our glorious and brilliant new China of people's democracy, is condensed from the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs who dedicated themselves to the revolution. Every Chinese person feels infinite glory to be able to stand up as a citizen of the People's Republic of China today. Defending the motherland is our sacred duty, there is no doubt about it. Performing military service in accordance with the law is our glorious task, there is no doubt about it. We must inherit the patriotic traditions of the revolutionary martyrs, we must maintain and carry forward the heroic achievements of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, we must constantly enrich our modern national defense forces. Only in this way can we ensure the security and territorial integrity of our motherland and ensure peace in Asia and peace in the world.

February 14 is the fifth anniversary of the signing of the great Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. At present, welcoming such an important day with historical significance allows us to further understand the great significance of our peace treaty. Our treaty is a treaty of jointly resisting aggression and defending peace in the Far East. Our treaty is a treaty of jointly promoting economic cooperation and creative cultural cooperation under equality and mutual benefit. For five years, thanks to the existence of this treaty, we have received great and selfless assistance from the Soviet Union, making our national construction career progress by leaps and bounds every day, making the proportion of peace forces constantly strengthened, and making the enemies of peace dare not easily expand the war. We want to sincerely and especially thank the Soviet Union, to further strengthen the unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union and the people of all fraternal people's democratic countries, to further actively learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, to speed up the national construction career, and to promote the steps of socialist industrialization and socialist transformation.

Especially in the peaceful use of atomic energy, we have received the great and selfless gifts and assistance from the Soviet Union. Our Chinese scientists should concentrate their efforts, strive to master comprehensive technology, and accelerate the transition from the experimental stage to the practical application stage. Our people's democratic system is suitable for using atomic energy to engage in large-scale peaceful production. It took Soviet scientists several years to use atomic energy for peaceful production. With Soviet scientists as a model and Soviet technical experience as a guide, as long as we are willing to study hard and step up our work, we should have the same confidence in using atomic energy for peaceful production within a few years.

In the past five years, our Chinese scientists have made achievements in learning from the Soviet Union. Taking Russian professional learning as an example, 93.2% of all researchers belonging to the Chinese Academy of Sciences have studied, 73.5% can read Russian literature, and 26.8% can translate Russian literature into Chinese. But we should not be satisfied with the achievements we have already made. We should further study on the basis of the achievements we have already made. The progress of the Soviet Union is changing rapidly, and our learning must also be changing rapidly. We must also strengthen our scientific team, strive to cultivate new forces, and closely link the scientific career with the vast number of workers and peasants—the masters of the country. The young people of China have long taken the study of science and technology as their main task, and we must not fail their aspirations. The era of atomic energy has arrived, and we must catch up, master the most advanced science and technology, to promote the speed of our socialist construction career, to strengthen the proportion of our peace forces to defend world peace and promote human happiness.

The forces of peace must overwhelm the forces of war before war can be eliminated.

(VII) Smash the Threat of Atomic War

While we concentrate our efforts to engage in the peaceful use of atomic energy, we must also concentrate our efforts to oppose the threat of atomic war.

In order to greed for super profits of war, the US imperialism takes the policy of war as a cardiotonic to maintain capitalism. Consequently, it always regards the manufacture of atomic weapons and thermonuclear weapons as the magic weapon for promoting the policy of war, and frequently conducts such weapons tests to intimidate the peace-loving people all over the world.

Since 1945, the atomic fanatics in the United States, including senior responsible personnel of the US government and some generals holding senior military positions, have frequently and continuously clamored to use atomic weapons against peace-loving people. We must not forget that at the end of 1950, when the United States was defeated on the Korean battlefield, former US President Truman had clamored to prepare to use atomic weapons. After the Korean armistice in August 1953, US Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Clark and Assistant Secretary of State Robertson made similar clamors. On May 26, 1954, US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Radford testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and he also clamored: If the United States intervenes in the Indochina War, it will be prepared to use atomic weapons.

These personal clamors of the fanatics became a public agreement of responsible representatives of relevant countries at the Paris Conference of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in mid-December last year. They legalized the use of atomic weapons by means of smuggling and prepared to hand over atomic weapons to West German generals for use at the same time as arming West Germany after the London and Paris Agreements were passed.

But such a serious threat is not limited to Europe. Radford, who had advocated the use of atomic weapons on the Indochina battlefield, arrived in Seoul, South Korea on January 2 after attending the Paris Conference of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and he made another clamor: If the Korean War restarts, the United States will use atomic bombs. He also said that the issue of using atomic weapons in other parts of Asia would also be decided depending on the situation. This shows that the agreement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to wage atomic war has a worldwide overall threat.

Seeing such a situation, the World Peace Council convened an expanded meeting of its Standing Committee in Vienna on January 18 and 19. With the participation of representatives from 30 countries, after heated discussions and unanimous agreement, a "Letter to the People of the World" was issued on January 19, calling on the people of the world to unite against the threat of atomic war, demanding the destruction of atomic weapons, and stopping manufacturing. In order to achieve this goal, it requires the people of all countries to launch a large-scale signature campaign.

This just call is powerful, timely, and in line with the demands of the people. Consequently, the signature campaign against atomic war has been rapidly launched in most countries in Europe, Asia, and America.

We Chinese people must express our full support for this movement.

In 1950, the Stockholm Declaration on the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons was signed. At that time, China had just been liberated, and more than 220 million signatures had already been collected.

In 1951, we collected more than 340 million signatures requesting the five major powers to conclude a peace treaty.

For this signature campaign against atomic war, we hope to get more signatures in a shorter period of time.

The World Peace Council and friends from all countries have the same expectations for us. The World Peace Council has decided to convene another Standing Committee meeting in March to check the progress of the signature campaign and exchange experiences. They hope that we can report greater achievements at the meeting in March, and they hope that before the World Congress of Peace Forces is convened in late May, the number of our signatures can reach as many as possible.

China has a large population, and the Chinese people are the masters of their own country and have obtained full freedom to express their will. There is no doubt that we should not fail the expectations of our friends. We should express the overwhelming majority of support for this movement against atomic war to encourage the peace forces all over the world and to condemn and crush the evil attempts of the atomic fanatics.

The atomic fanatics have concerns in their minds. They are both afraid of retaliation and afraid of moral condemnation from all mankind. But they have long wanted to paralyze people's sense of morality. Their constant clamoring and their daring to issue public agreements by means of smuggling is an attempt to create the illusion that atomic war is inevitable in the minds of the people of the world, paving the way for them to launch an atomic war.

We absolutely cannot tolerate this evil attempt. We must condemn this evil attempt and we must crush it.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai made the will of the Chinese people very clear and firm in the "Statement

    加强和平力量，粉碎原子战争的威胁！
    ——在中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员联席扩大会议上的报告
    郭沫若
      （一）和平力量日益壮大
    当前的国际局势，我们可以首先用一句话来概括，便是侵略和战争的势力日益猖獗和危险，但是和平的力量比侵略和战争的势力更为强大。
    和平力量的核心——以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营，由于制度的优越，各方面的建设事业突飞猛进，有了极坚实的成就；由于九亿人民的兄弟友谊牢不可破，团结益加巩固，大公无私的相互协助和合作益加发展；由于一贯坚持的和平政策为全世界爱好和平的人民愈益认识和支持，由于这一切，使和平运动的基础就愈加扩大，保卫世界和平事业就有了显著的重大成就。
    拿一九五四年来说，和平事业的成就，在欧洲，我们看到“欧洲军”计划的破产，我们看到追随美国侵略政策的法国拉尼埃政府受到法国人民的清算，我们看到西欧各国人民反对巴黎协定的斗争正在蓬蓬勃勃地发展。在亚洲，我们看到虽然主要是讨论亚洲问题的但和世界和平有密切关联的日内瓦会议获得成功；我们看到继朝鲜停战之后，印度支那的和平恢复了；我们看到中印和中缅的联合声明先后提出和平共处的五项原则愈益得到亚洲各国人民的拥护，印度总理尼赫鲁和缅甸总理吴努的先后访问中国更使中印中缅之间的友好关系有了进一步的发展；我们看到中苏两国政府的联合宣言，特别是根据和平共处五项原则向日本人民所提出的恢复正常关系的呼吁，鼓舞了日本人民的和平意志，追随美国侵略政策的吉田政府因而垮台了。
    美帝国主义自二次大战结束以来，便承继了法西斯主义的衣钵，企图独霸世界，奴役全世界的人民。尽管资本主义已经走向末路，但它专依靠着战争政策，靠着战争的准备和推进，吸取大额的战争利润，用以维持一时性的变相的繁荣。和平事业的连续不断的成就，毫无疑义，就是美帝国主义者所奉行的战争政策的逐步破产。特别在日内瓦会议期中，美国的好战分子们曾经不断地号叫：美国在国际事务中已处到空前孤立的地位。在这种恐慌情绪中，美国的好战分子和它的追随者们因而采取了一系列的反动措施，企图继续制造紧张的国际局势。
    在欧洲，他们制订了不得人心的伦敦、巴黎协定，想迅速武装西德；特别在一九五四年十二月中旬，北大西洋公约组织在巴黎开会，经过了两天的会议，竟由政府的负责代表们公然协议准备进行原子战争，对欧洲人民和世界各国人民采取了进一步的罪恶的原子讹诈政策。
    在亚洲，美国的好战分子们极力阻挠朝鲜问题的进一步的和平解决；不断地表示出破坏印度支那和平的企图和行动；九月初在马尼拉纠合英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、菲律宾、泰国、巴基斯坦等国缔结了以维持殖民地统治，破坏日内瓦协定为目的的所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”；十二月和蒋介石卖国集团缔结了所谓“共同防御条约”，更进一步地与中国人民为敌。
    这一系列的违背人民意志的反动措施，毫无疑问，是世界和平与人类幸福的严重威胁，这就使得已经一度趋向和缓的国际局势又逐步地趋向了紧张。
      （二）一定要解放台湾
    今年，中国人民在解放台湾的斗争中胜利地把一江山岛解放了。美国政府于是便更加恐慌，因而也就更加猖狂了起来。
    一月二十四日美国总统艾森豪威尔向美国国会提出了“特别咨文”，要求授予他这种权力：“在必要时使用美国武装部队来保证台湾和澎湖列岛的安全”。美国国会通过了他的建议。于是自一九五○年六月以来早就在保护着蒋介石卖国集团的美国武装部队，也就更加明目张胆地向我们进行战争挑衅了。
    但是，美国政府是采取着两面政策的。它一面张牙舞爪地用战争来威胁我们，而在另一面却串通着它的仆从国家英国和新西兰使用“和平”的幌子来进行引诱并欺骗世界舆论。
    一月三十一日新西兰的驻联合国代表公然向联合国提出一项建议：要求中国人民和蒋介石卖国集团之间在台湾海峡“停火”。联合国安全理事会竟火速地通过了这项建议，并邀请我派遣代表参加讨论。
    新西兰的这项建议是完全为美国侵略政策服务的。它把美国侵占台湾，陈兵台湾海峡，构成远东紧张局势的根本原因一字不提，而却狂妄地违反联合国宪章干涉我国内政。
    联合国宪章第二条第七款明白地规定：“宪章不得授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家内管辖之事件，且并不要求会员国将该项事件依本宪章提请解决”。
    台湾和其他岛屿是中国的领土，中国人民要解放卖国贼借外来力量的保护所盘踞着的领土，完全是“在本质上属于国家内管辖之事件”。新西兰代表受着美国的指使“提请解决”是违反宪章；而联合国竟接受了这个提案，公然干涉我国的内政，也同样的违反宪章。
    更可注意的是，在新西兰建议提出之前的一月三十日，经常主持正义的苏联通过他的驻联合国的代表索波列夫，已经向联合国提出了一项合理的建议：美国政府应立即采取步骤，以终止在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为和它对中国内政的干涉，从台湾和属于中国的其他一切领土撤退美国的一切海、陆、空军部队；为便于不属于中华人民共和国的一切武装部队的撤退，吁请任何一方防止在台湾地区的军事行动。
    苏联的提案正确地说明了台湾问题的本质。然而安全理事会却在美英操纵之下，把它压到新西兰提案之后讨论。这是又一次在世界人民面前证明：联合国不外是美国侵略集团所操纵着的工具而已。
    联合国安全理事会那样火速地通过新西兰的非法建议并立即向我提出邀请，它的目的是什么呢？那不外是诱引我去陷入美帝国主义和它的仆从国家们所为我布置的圈套。它们满以为中国人民会被美国的战争威胁所吓倒，而且会贸贸然派遣代表去参加新西兰的非法提案的讨论。它们是尽了诱导的能事的。假使我们贸贸然前去参加了，那在事实上就等于是承认了台湾问题不是我国内政，承认了台湾和其它岛屿是美国的保护国，承认了确实有“两个中国”的存在。
    美帝国主义和它的可耻的追随者们，它们是把对象完全看错了。久经战斗的站起来了的中国人民，既不会为任何战争威胁所吓倒，也不会为任何欺骗策略所愚弄。
    我们完全拥护周恩来总理二月三日给联合国秘书长的回电，严正地驳斥了新西兰代表的非法建议，拒绝派遣代表参加讨论。“只有在为了讨论苏联的提案并在安全理事会驱逐蒋介石集团的代表而由中华人民共和国的代表出席代表中国的情况下，中华人民共和国才能同意派遣代表参加安全理事会的讨论。”
    周恩来总理又一次地明确声明：“台湾地区的紧张局势是由美国侵占台湾，干涉中国内政造成的。国际上一切为和缓并消除美国在这个地区和远东其他地区所造成的紧张局势的真正努力，都将得到中华人民共和国的支持。”
    这完全是我们全体六万万中国人民的共同意志。
    我们中国人民是热爱和平的，但决不会牺牲自己的领土主权去向侵略者乞求和平。
    我们中国人民是反对战争的，但如果侵略者敢于使用武力来侵犯我们，为了保卫祖国的安全和远东的和平，我们一定要抗战到底，不得胜利，决不罢休。
    台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾。美帝国主义的一切武装力量必须从台湾和台湾海峡撤走！任何妄想割裂中国的领土造成“两个中国”的主张，所谓“台湾中立化”，所谓“托管”，所谓“主权未定”，都是中国人民绝对不能接受的。
      （三）我们决不是孤立的
    美帝国主义者的横行霸道，肆无忌惮在今天已经达到了史无先例的阶段了。
    他们自封为所谓“自由世界”的保护者。他们自由地把太平洋和大西洋当成美国的内海，自由地干犯别国的独立主权和领土完整，在别的国家内布置军事基地、驻扎军事人员，垄断它们的军需资源；自由地蹂躏国际协定，组织军事集团，挑拨民族仇恨；自由地对社会主义和人民民主国家实行封锁禁运，公开叫嚣要“解放”社会主义和人民民主国家的人民；自由地颠倒黑白，把别的民族保卫自己的独立主权和领土完整说成“侵略”，而把自己的侵略说成为“保卫”……。
    他们的“自由”真是无限制，但我们要向全世界重新宣告一次：我们中国人民决不能允许美帝国主义者有“保护”我国神圣领土台湾和其他岛屿的“自由”。
    我们中国人民解放台湾的神圣斗争，已经得到了全世界爱好和平和正义的人民的普遍支持。
    我们感谢印度人民。他们在二月六日在全国各地举行了“撤出台湾日”，要求美国把它的武装部队撤离台湾海峡，并且停止干涉中国内政。
    我们感谢苏联政府。苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁元帅二月九日在最高苏维埃会议上的演说，已经明确声明，我们中国人民的“这一崇高事业”会得到“伟大的苏联人民的援助”。
    我们感谢全世界爱好和平的劳动人民和主持正义的人士，他们都是我们的友军，我们决不是孤立的。
    同时我们也明确地知道，美国好战分子远离本国一万一千公里，陈兵台湾海峡，实行战争挑衅，这也决不是美国人民的意志。
    美国人民是反对战争的。
    我们并没有忘记，在两年多前艾森豪威尔是以停止朝鲜战争为号召才争取到了美国人民的多数选票而上台的。在他的执政期间，据克罗斯勒民意测验，朝鲜停战是最得人心的唯一的一项政绩（据去年五月“美国新闻”所载“波士顿邮报”的公布）。
    在印度支那和平还未恢复的时候，在日内瓦会议的前夕，美国政府曾经有一部分人积极主张参加战争，但在当时美国国会所接到的人民来信，反对参加的占百分之九十。去年三月盖洛普的民意测验，反对参加者百分之八十五，赞成者百分之八，中立者百分之七。反对与赞成之比大于十与一之比。
    根据这些既往的事实，我们可以断定，美国政府今天要为保护蒋介石集团而同中国作战，也就是要掀起又一次世界大战，连有限战场的战争都表示反对的美国人民是决不会同意的。
    无论艾森豪威尔和他的幕僚们有天大的本领，他们不能以侵略性的战争来动员本国人民，更不能于短暂的期间内改变绝大多数人民的反战意志。
    由此可见，美国参众两院对于艾森豪威尔“特别咨文”的多数支持，只是假相的多数。那些议员先生们所代表的只是少数美国资本家的血腥利润，而不是美国人民的善良意志。
    美国人民反对战争，美国的仆从国家们更害怕战争，美国的好战分子们也明白地知道这一点。因此为了实现他们的战争政策，他们早就想用亚洲人来打亚洲人，用欧洲人来打欧洲人，他们早就处心积虑地想积极武装日本和西德。然而这样的阴谋一直到目前进行得也并不那么顺利。
    在西德，德国人民是反对伦敦、巴黎协定的，而且坚决反对重新武装。去年十一月二十六日“美国新闻与世界报道”中登载了一篇文章，题目是
  “德国能够产生一支军队吗？”那里面所透露的情况是“成千成万已经达到兵役年龄的德国青年不愿参加任何新的德国军队。……在很多情形下，他们受着他们的父亲——曾在一次或两次世界大战中为德国作过战的人——的支持。”又说：“杜塞尔多夫有一个印刷工会最近建议它的会员们拒绝印刷征兵通知”。
    爱好和平的德国人民的这种反对战争的意志也很鲜明地反映在西德社会民主党的主张上。西德社会民主党的领袖奥伦豪尔在一月二十五日发表广播演说，反对伦敦、巴黎协定，主张和苏联会谈，重新统一德国。他们认为“德国政策最迫切的目的将是克服德国不愉快的分裂。”
    不得人心的伦敦、巴黎协定在法国国民议会，经过极大的曲折，仅以微弱的多数通过，但在共和国参议院进行讨论之前，积极支持这一协定的孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府又继拉尼埃政府之后被法国人民清算了。
    这一协定在西德的国会里面才仅仅通过了一读，但由于德国人民的反对和法国政府改换的影响，看来要通过二读和三读是很难有把握的了。人民所不肯支持的协定即使在国会通过了，有什么束缚的力量呢？
    在日本，日本人民的中心要求便是争取民族独立，摆脱美国的控制。执政了六年、一意追随美国政策的吉田政府受到清算，便是日本人民反对美国政策的最鲜明的表示。
    在一九四五年八月，第二次世界大战在东方战场上也快要结束的时候，美国政府完全别有用意地把当时所仅有的两枚原子炸弹向广岛和长崎的和平市民投掷了，屠杀了大量的无辜的日本人民。约一年以前美国政府在比基尼岛试验氢弹，日本人民又直接遭受到祸害的波及。
    由于这样的历史关系，日本人民是坚决反对原子武器和氢武器的。一月十六日日本人民在东京曾经举行了反对原子武器和氢武器的大会。他们在反对原子战争的威胁上已经领先地发动了签名运动，并已征集到二千二百万人的签名。
    西德和日本是美国好战分子们所期待的发动另一次大战的选手。然而实际的情形就是这样，不忙说西德和日本在今天还没有充分地武装起来，即使有了充分的武装，究竟谁有那样大的本领，能够动员爱好和平的西德人民和日本人民为美国资本家的利益而流血呢？
    我们中国人民决不是孤立的。我们有充分的力量足以反抗侵略，我们也有充分的后盾足以赢得战争。
    人民是反对战争的，然而战争的结果必然是人民的胜利。
    （四）战争与和平的力量对比
    美帝国主义者应该是不会那么健忘的吧？
    仅仅在五年多以前，他们曾经花费了六十亿美元的资本，使用了蒋介石卖国集团的八百万人的军队，来和中国人民对敌，然而结果怎样了。
    朝鲜战场上的经验，“伤心岭”上的“伤心”，也应该还是很新鲜的吧？
    去年五月，“哈泼斯”杂志上有切斯特·鲍尔士的“美国对亚洲问题的两党政策”的一篇文章，那里面有这么一段：
    “在朝鲜的有限战场上，四十万久经战斗的美国和联合国军队再加上六十万南朝鲜军队，有着制空权而且两翼受美国军舰保护，都没有取得决定性的胜利。那么我们怎能期望一支人数不及上述一半的中国国民党军队（平均年龄二十九岁）来击溃中国红军呢？即使有我们空军与海军的支持。日本在三十年代的经验，应该使我们在考虑这一冒险行动的时候再思而后行。”
    是的，日本军阀发动侵华战争的结果对美国将军们的确是一项宝贵的教训。即使他们不肯想一想这项教训，也希望他们把朝鲜战争结束时的情况回忆一遍。一九五三年夏季，朝中人民部队在金城以南的反击战中，是怎样坚强地一举击溃了美国所装备的李承晚军队四个多师，迫使得美国将军们不能不把朝鲜战争停止了下来。就请把这个新鲜的历史反刍一下吧！
    保卫世界和平最坚强的堡垒，我们的伟大盟邦苏联的力量，美国的将军们是知道得更清楚的。他们早就知道，苏联已经有了原子武器和氢武器，苏联也已经有了远距离飞程的喷气式重轰炸机。
    但是，苏联的武器只是作为防卫的武器而制造的。苏联决不会使用这种大量毁灭性的武器来先发制人，也决不会把这种武器来向谁恫胁，倒宁是不断地提出正义的呼吁：禁止这种武器，毁灭这种武器。
    美国的将军们和发了原子狂的战犯候补者，倒是应当晓得，拿原子武器来进行讹诈是吓不倒别人而只能吓倒他们自己的。这种武器的制造，既早已脱离了美国垄断的阶段，他们如果使用，就不能不考虑别人对他们的报复。布尔加宁元帅在去年七月二十二日曾经说过这样的话：“谁如果敢于使用原子武器，苏联要一个还十个”。四天前的二月八日，苏联外交部长莫洛托夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上的报告中也明白地宣告了：“苏联人在氢武器制造方面已取得了如此的成就，以致落在后面的不是苏联，而是美利坚合众国了。”这，正是对于原子狂人们的当头棒喝呵。
    苏联和中国，幅员辽阔，人口密度不大。苏联的工业区域是有计划地分散布置的，中国的工业化却才正在开头。因而大量毁灭性的武器，对于我们的危害性倒并不那么严重。但在美国和英法等国，那情形就完全两样。拿美国来说，工业区域偏在北部，百分之六十五的工业集中在占全国面积百分之九的地区里面。在这样的情况之下，假使遭到原子武器的报复，那是要受到极沉重的打击的。因此，美国狂人们的原子讹诈政策，结果是不能不先把自己吓倒了。
    原子狂人们尽管自己甘心毁灭，但人民是不甘心毁灭的。全世界爱好和平的劳动人民早就准备着把一些原子狂人们宣布为头等的战争罪犯了！
      （五）衷心地感谢苏联
    在这里我们对于伟大的盟邦苏联，不能不特别表示衷心的感谢。
    伟大的盟邦苏联是最坚强的和平堡垒。
    由于社会主义制度的优越，由于苏联人民的团结一致，共同努力，由于苏联科学家们在马克思列宁主义的旗帜之下的有组织、有计划的创造性的研究，苏联不仅早就有了原子武器和氢武器，制止了原子狂人们的轻举妄动，而且在去年六月二十七日已经建成了一座原子能工业电力站，即“苏联科学院原子能发电站”，在把原子能这种有大量生产性能的原动力服务于和平建设的事业上，博得了光荣的领导地位。
    在一九四五年原子能开始被人控制而被利用的时候，当时的进步的科学家们早就预言到：原子能不出十年之内会被利用于和平生产，而且苏联必然占先。这个科学性的预言是完全的中了。社会主义制度的苏联，以国家规模有计划地进行生产建设和其他建设的苏联，规模宏大的生产结构正适于使用原子能这样宏大的生产力。在资本主义国家，由于制度的限制，在原子能和平利用上便不能不远远落在后边了。
    美国在原子能利用上，和苏联也恰恰形成了一个对比。美国政府只是把原子能利用到大量杀人的武器制造上面，尽管今天这种武器制造的垄断性已经老早失掉了，但它依然在加紧生产，而且依然在加紧它的讹诈政策，不断地试验原子武器和氢武器，不断地作出歇斯底里性的叫嚣，并串同它的仆从国家们公开协议要进行原子战争。美国的原子狂人们在和平力量之前愈感到恐慌，便愈见猖狂地进行原子讹诈。但是美国到什么时候才能为和平目的而使用原子能呢？在这里有一段很有趣的问答。
    去年十二月十七日的“美国新闻与世界报道”载有美国政府的原子能委员会主席斯特劳斯的谈话。有人问他：“关于原子能为和平目的使用，要多少时候才能实现？”他的回答是：“假使我们没有战争，我相信要在十年到二十年的时间。我或许过分乐观，但这是我的猜想。”
    这应该是斯特劳斯先生的老实话，但我们可以肯定地说，他的“十年到二十年的时间”的“猜想”确实是“过分乐观”了。在同一期的“美国新闻与世界报道”上又载了一位汽油公司的化学专家罗伯特·伊·威尔逊的谈话，他说得更要老实一些。他认为原子能利用于和平工业中要十年到二十五年的时间。他说，主要的理由是今天美国政府的主要力量放在研究原子能军用方面，而不注意和平用途，私人的商业公司不肯花费这样大的资本来研究，而且无利可图，更没有人愿意积极进行。
    这就是和平与战争——这两条路线的斗争在原子能利用方面的极其鲜明的反映。
    苏联有了原子武器和氢武器，但主张销毁它们，而集中力量从事于原子能的和平利用。苏联尽管领先控制了原子能服务于和平的用途，但并不想垄断，而且准备把技术公开，要在国际会议上提出报告。一月十七日苏联部长会议发表声明：对于中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、德意志民主共和国分别赠送具有五千瓩热能的实验性原子堆和原子微粒加速器的设备，并在研究技术上进行帮助。苏联政府还更进一步地考虑扩大它所能援助的国家的范围。
    美国政府呢？在它加紧进行原子讹诈的另一面，它也没有忘记把原子能和平利用作为它的幌子。据去年十二月三日“美国新闻与世界报道”所载：艾森豪威尔答应送二二○磅铀料供世界和平原子能研究的使用。据说，这个数量的铀料可以制造十一个原子弹，合黄金的价格二十四倍——这些计算的标准真是合乎一手拿着金元，一手拿着原子武器的美国姿态呀。但是这份原料据说并不能送给一个国家，而是要分送给许多国家：接受原料的国家必须和美国订立安全条约，要办完订约的手续须得费一年的时间。还有接受了原料的国家，要它们自己去建设研究机构，掌握技术，美国是不管研究设备和技术的。
    据说“这是美国对和平的一份大礼”，真真是要令人喷饭！美国政府的“这一份大礼”——“十一个原子弹”的铀料要在一年之后才施舍给被施舍的国家，让它们去自行摸索原子能和平利用的技术——事实上美国也并没有这样的经验，但在本年一月二十九日，美国政府的原子能委员会却向美国国会提出了报告：要在二月份试验八次至十二次的原子爆炸。这岂不是又一次地自己揭去自己的假面具吗？毕竟原子讹诈才是本位的政策而原子施舍不过是和平的幌子而已。
      （六）加强和平力量的比重
    但是，战争贩子们的精神状态是迫近于狂人的阶段的。他们的理论和行动都不能以一般的逻辑来规律。因此，我们既不能过高地估计敌人的力量，也不能过低地估计敌人的力量。我们决不能麻痹大意，也决不能盲目乐观。我们必须加倍地提高警惕，提防意外的突然事变，提防和平敌人的“狗急跳墙”。
    我们一定要有准备，要不断地加强和平力量的比重，来粉碎和平的敌人可能有的任何猖狂的行动。保卫国家的安全与领土完整，保卫亚洲和世界的和平，这是一种长期性的斗争，我们必须加强团结，决不松懈，以争取到最后的胜利。
    在目前，我们的一项重要的法案——“中华人民共和国兵役法草案”已经由国务院发给各级人民委员会讨论并征求人民意见。这是我们全中国人民，特别是年满十八岁的青年，表示我们加强和平力量的坚强意志的绝好的机会。我们要以全力来支持这项重要的法案，保证它必须在全国人民代表大会下一次会议上通过，及早见诸实施。
    事情是十分明显的，我们要保卫亚洲和世界的和平必须反抗侵略势力，我们要保障祖国的安全必须巩固国防建设，我们要解放台湾和其他岛屿必须把侵略者的武装力量全部赶走。我们要把祖国建设成为伟大的社会主义国家，不仅要防御外在的敌人，还必须戒备可能有的内在的敌人。因此，我们的宪法，在第一百零三条上已经有了明确的规定：
      “保卫祖国是中华人民共和国每一个公民的神圣职责。依照法律服兵役是中华人民共和国公民的光荣义务。”
    我们的祖国，我们的光辉灿烂的人民民主的新中国，是无数献身革命的烈士们的鲜血所凝成的。我们每一个中国人，在今天能够作为中华人民共和国的一个公民站立起来，都感受着无限的光荣。保卫祖国是我们的神圣职责，这是毫无疑问的。依照法律服兵役是我们的光辉任务，这也是毫无疑问的。我们一定要继承革命烈士们的爱国传统，一定要保持并发扬中国人民解放军的英雄业绩，一定要不断地充实我们的现代化的国防军，要这样我们才能够保障祖国的安全和领土完整，才能够保障亚洲的和平与世界的和平。
    二月十四日，这是伟大的中苏友好同盟互助条约签订五周年的纪念日。我们在目前迎接到这样具有历史意义的重要的日子，正好让我们更加深入地认识我们的和平条约的伟大意义。我们的条约是共同反抗侵略、保卫远东和平的条约。我们的条约是共同推进在平等互利之下的经济合作和创造性的文化合作的条约。五年来，由于有了这个条约的存在，我们得到苏联的伟大无私的帮助，使我们的国家建设事业有了一日千里的进展，使和平力量的比重有了不断的加强，使和平的敌人一直不敢轻于扩大战争。我们要由衷地特别感谢苏联，要更进一步地加强中苏两国人民与同各人民民主兄弟国家人民的团结，要更进一步地积极学习苏联的先进经验，加紧国家建设事业，促进社会主义工业化和社会主义改造的步骤。
    特别在原子能和平利用方面，我们接受到苏联的伟大无私的赠予和帮助，我们中国的科学家们应该集中力量，努力掌握全面的技术，加速从实验的阶段走上实际利用的阶段。我们的人民民主制度是适宜于使用原子能从事于大量的和平生产事业的。苏联科学家把原子能利用于和平生产事业费了几年工夫，我们有了苏联科学家做模范，有了苏联的技术经验做向导，只要我们肯努力学习，加紧工作，在几年之内，我们应该同样有把握把原子能利用于和平生产事业。
    五年来我们中国科学家在学习苏联方面是有成就的，拿俄文专业学习来说，属于中国科学院的全体研究员就已有百分之九三点二的人进行了学习，百分之七三点五的人能阅读俄文文献，百分之二六点八的人能把俄文文献译成中文。但我们不应该满足于既得的成就，我们应该在既得成就的基础上更进一步学习。苏联的进展是日新月异的，我们的学习也必须是日新月异。我们还必须壮大我们的科学队伍，努力培养新生力量，把科学事业和广大的工农群众——国家的主人翁，密切地联系起来。中国的青年们早就把学习科学技术作为主要任务，我们不要辜负他们的志愿。已经到了原子能的时代了，我们必须迎头赶上，掌握最先进的科学技术，来促进我们的社会主义建设事业的速度，来加强我们的保卫世界和平增进人类幸福的和平力量的比重。
    和平力量一定要把战争力量压倒，然后才能消灭战争。
    （七）粉碎原子战争的威胁
    我们既要集中力量来从事于原子能的和平利用，而在同时也要集中力量来反对原子战争的威胁。
    美帝国主义为了贪图超额的战争利润，它把战争政策作为维持资本主义的强心剂。因而它把原子武器和热核子武器的制造始终当成为推进战争政策的法宝，更经常进行这种武器的试验来恫吓全世界爱好和平的人民。
    自一九四五年以来，美国的原子狂人们，包含美国政府的高级负责人员和一些担任高级军事职务的将军都经常不断地叫嚣着要对爱好和平的人民使用原子武器。我们不能忘记，在一九五○年底美国在朝鲜战场上打败了的时候，美国前总统杜鲁门就曾经叫嚣过要准备使用原子武器。在一九五三年八月朝鲜停战后，联合国军总司令美国的克拉克和助理国务卿罗伯逊都作过同样的叫嚣。在一九五四年五月二十六日，美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福在众议院外交委员会作证，他也叫嚣着：如果美国干涉印度支那战争，便准备使用原子武器。
    这些狂人们的个人叫嚣，在去年十二月中旬北大西洋公约组织的巴黎会议上，竟成为了有关国家政府负责代表们的公开协议了。他们用走私的方式把使用原子武器合法化，并准备在伦敦、巴黎协定通过之后，在进行武装西德的同时把原子武器交给西德的将军们使用。
    但这样严重的威胁并不限于欧洲。那位曾经主张在印度支那战场上使用原子武器的雷德福，在参加了北大西洋公约组织的巴黎会议后，一月二日到了朝鲜的汉城，他又作了一次叫嚣：如果朝鲜战争再起，美国就要使用原子弹。而且还说，在亚洲其他地方使用原子武器的问题也要看情况决定。这就说明，北大西洋公约组织进行原子战争的协议，是有世界性的全面威胁了。
    世界和平理事会看到这样的情势，在一月十八日和十九日在维也纳召开了一次常务委员会扩大会议。在三十个国家的代表参加之下，经过了热烈的讨论和一致的同意，在一月十九日发表了一项“告全世界人民书”，吁请世界人民一致起来反对原子战争的威胁，要求毁灭原子武器，并停止制造。为了达到这一目的，要求世界各国人民发动大规模的签名运动。
    这一正义的呼吁是有力的，适时的，合乎人民的要求的。因而反对原子战争的签名运动已经在欧洲、亚洲、美洲的多数国家迅速地展开了。
    我们中国人民对于这一运动必须表示全力的支持。
    一九五○年禁止使用原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言签名，在当时我们中国才解放不久，便已经征集了二亿二千多万。
    一九五一年要求五大国缔结和平公约的签名，我们更征集到了三亿四千多万。
    这一次反对原子战争的签名运动，我们希望能在更短的时期内得到更多的签名。
    世界和平理事会和各国的朋友们对于我们都有同样的期待。世界和平理事会已决定在三月间再召开一次常务委员会，以检查签名运动进行情况并交流经验。他们希望我们能在三月的会议上报告出较大的成绩，并希望我们在五月下旬世界和平力量大会召开之前，我们的签名人数能够达到尽可能的多数。
    我们中国的人口众多，中国人民是自己国家的主人，已经获得了表示意志的充分自由。毫无疑问，我们应该不要辜负友人们的期待。我们对于反对原子战争这一运动应该表示出绝大多数的支持，来鼓舞全世界的和平力量，来谴责并粉碎原子狂人们的万恶企图。
    原子狂人们在心目中是有所顾忌的，他们既害怕报复，同时也害怕全人类的道义性谴责。但他们很早以来就想麻痹人们的道义感。他们在经常不断地叫嚣，并敢于用走私的方式发布公开协议，就是企图在世界人民心目中造成原子战争不可避免的错觉，为他们发动原子战争铺平道路。
    这种万恶的企图，我们是绝对不能容忍的。我们对这种万恶的企图，必须加以谴责，并必须加以粉碎。
    周恩来总理兼外长一月二十四日在“关于美国政府干涉中国人民解放台湾的声明”中把中国人民的意志说得很明确而且坚定；美国政府及其追随者
  “企图用战争威胁和原子武器的恐吓，强使中国人民容忍美国侵占台湾，承认美蒋‘共同防御条约’，容许美国利用台湾作为军事基地，准备新的战争。这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的。这是中国人民坚决反对的。”
    为了表示我们的坚决反对——反对原子战争的威胁，反对美帝国主义在全世界布置军事基地、准备新的战争，反对美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾及其他岛屿。我们全体中国人民，请踊跃地签名吧！
    我们要表示：中国人民绝对不会为任何战争威胁所吓倒。同时我们也有庄严的责任，要坚决地和苏联与人民民主兄弟国家一道，鼓励全世界爱好和平的人民同样不要为任何战争的威胁所吓倒。
    全世界爱好和平的人民，如果一致团结起来，坚决反对原子武器的使用，对原子狂人们加强道义性的谴责，决不麻痹，决不放松，原子狂人们的万恶企图是不能得逞的。
    人民的力量一定能够把任何战争的威胁加以粉碎！全世界人民大团结万岁！世界和平万岁！（新华社）
