Oppose the Use of Atomic Weapons, Resolutely Liberate Taiwan

Hu Ziang, Vice Chairman of the Chongqing Municipal People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee

The great Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has the sacred duty of mutually promoting the economic and cultural development of the two countries, opposing aggression, opposing war, and safeguarding peace. Over the past five years, our great ally, the Soviet Union, has continuously provided us with selfless assistance in various aspects such as economy, culture, and science and technology, enabling our country's great socialist construction cause to achieve tremendous achievements. The Sino-Soviet alliance, including 800 million people, not only powerfully guarantees the security of the two countries, but also plays a huge role in maintaining peace in the Far East and the world. The extinguishing of the Korean War and the restoration of peace in Indochina are inseparable from the profound influence of the Sino-Soviet alliance.

However, the aggressive bloc headed by the American rulers is taking a completely opposite path, especially their open clamoring for and preparation for atomic war, which has reached a state of frenzy. Everyone knows that the American aggressive bloc no longer holds a monopoly in atomic and hydrogen weapons, and it is they themselves, not the Soviet Union, who are lagging behind in this regard. However, they have not abandoned their fanaticism for atomic war. In Europe, they are preparing to hand over atomic weapons to the successors of Hitler, and the North Atlantic aggressive bloc has decided to prepare for atomic war in Europe. In the Far East, American imperialism is also actively establishing atomic bases on the Pacific island chain. In contrast, the Soviet Union has always insisted on banning the use of atomic weapons and is about to publicly share its successful experience in the peaceful use of atomic energy, and is preparing to provide many countries with scientific, technical, and industrial assistance in researching the peaceful use of atomic energy. Everyone can see that there are two completely different paths on the issue of how to use atomic energy. The United States and its followers are using atomic energy to carry out destructive wars, while the Soviet Union is using atomic energy to widely benefit mankind. The American aggressive bloc has moved from atomic blackmail to a policy of actually preparing for atomic war, which is increasingly seriously threatening the peace and security of hundreds of millions of people around the world. To this end, the expanded meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council held in Vienna issued a great call for signatures against atomic war, and this signature campaign has rapidly unfolded in many countries. We also warmly welcome the Soviet Union's just measures to use atomic energy for peace, actively support the solemn call of the World Peace Council, and resolutely oppose the heinous atomic war being instigated by the United States. Our 60 million people in Sichuan, like the people of the whole country, have actively participated in the signature campaign to safeguard peace in the past. In Chongqing alone, more than 1,198,000 people participated in the peace endorsement signature campaign in 1951. Now we are carrying out the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons more deeply and extensively, further demonstrating our firm will and strength to safeguard peace. We believe that the atomic war conspiracy of the American aggressive bloc will surely be shattered by the protests of the people of the world, and the final victory will definitely not belong to the clamorers of atomic war, but to the peace-loving people.

What is particularly intolerable is that American imperialism is openly invading our country's territory of Taiwan and barbarously interfering in our country's internal affairs. Recently, after the liberation of Yijiangshan Island, the American aggressive bloc, on the one hand, directly participated in the military actions of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, further carrying out war provocations against our country, and on the other hand, instigated a "ceasefire" conspiracy in the United Nations, using its partners to create the extremely absurd fallacy of "two Chinas," attempting to confuse public opinion in order to achieve its goal of occupying our country's Taiwan. These shameless acts of aggression by the United States not only arouse the extreme anger of our people, but have also been resolutely opposed by the Soviet Union. The joint declaration of the two governments issued after the Sino-Soviet talks last year, the Soviet government's statement on the US-Chiang treaty, as well as the recent suggestions of the Soviet representative at the United Nations Security Council, and the foreign policy report of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov at the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting, all severely condemned the American aggression against our country, giving strong support to the just cause of our people who are liberating Taiwan. Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, N.A. Bulganin, also said in his recent speech: "The Chinese people can expect to receive assistance from their loyal friend, the great Soviet people, in this lofty cause." Such great and cordial friendship is deeply imprinted in the hearts of the Chinese people, further strengthening our people's belief in liberating Taiwan. We firmly declare that no matter whether American imperialism is engaging in blatant provocations or carrying out hypocritical deceptions, it will not shake our determination to liberate Taiwan in the slightest. The Chinese people will never give up until Taiwan is liberated.

On the occasion of celebrating the fifth anniversary of the Sino-Soviet alliance, our various democratic parties, people's organizations, and other patriotic democratic people should unite more closely under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, highly promote patriotism and internationalism, protect the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union as we protect our own eyes, continue to consolidate and strengthen the world peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and advance victoriously for the great cause of safeguarding the integrity of our national territorial sovereignty, opposing atomic war, and maintaining peace in Asia and the world.

    反对使用原子武器，坚决解放台湾
    重庆市各界人民代表会议协商委员会副主席  胡子昂
    伟大的中苏友好同盟互助条约，是以相互促进两国经济文化的发展，反对侵略、反对战争、保卫和平为神圣职责的。五年来我们伟大的盟邦苏联从经济文化及科学技术等各方面，不断给予我们无私的援助，使我国社会主义的伟大建设事业获得了巨大的成就。包括八亿人口的中苏同盟，不但有力地保障着两国的安全，而且对维护远东与世界和平也起了巨大作用。朝鲜战火的扑灭，印度支那和平的恢复，都是和中苏同盟所发生的深刻影响分不开的。
    但是，目前以美国统治者为首的侵略集团却走着完全相反的道路，特别是他们公开叫嚣和准备原子战争的行为，已经到了昏狂的程度。谁都知道，美国侵略集团在原子武器和氢武器方面早已不再居于垄断地位，在这一方面落后的已不再是苏联，而是他们自己，但是他们仍然没有放弃原子战争的狂热。在欧洲，他们正准备将原子武器交给希特勒的继承者，北大西洋侵略集团并决定在欧洲进行原子战争的准备。在远东，美帝国主义也正积极在太平洋岛屿锁链上建立原子基地。与此相反，苏联一直坚持禁止使用原子武器，并即将公开他在和平利用原子能方面的成功经验，正准备给予许多国家在研究和平使用原子能方面以科学技术及工业上的帮助。谁都看得见，在如何利用原子能问题上存在着两条完全不同的路线。美国及其追随者是将原子能用来进行毁灭性的战争，而苏联是把原子能用来广泛地造福人类。美国侵略集团已经从原子讹诈进到实际准备原子战争的政策，越来越严重地威胁着全世界亿万人民的和平与安全。为此在维也纳举行的世界和平理事会常委会扩大会议发出了签名反对原子战争的伟大号召，在许多国家里这个签名运动已经迅速展开。我们也热烈欢迎苏联把原子能用于和平的正义措施，积极拥护世界和平理事会的庄严号召，坚决反对美国正在策动的万恶的原子战争。我们四川六千多万人民和全国人民一样，过去曾积极参加签名维护和平的运动。单重庆一地，在一九五一年参加拥护和平签名的即达一百十九万八千余人。现在我们正在更加深入广泛地开展反对使用原子武器的签名运动，进一步显示我们保卫和平的坚强意志和力量。我们相信美国侵略集团的原子战争阴谋，一定将被全世界人民的抗议所粉碎，最后胜利的决不是原子战争的叫嚣者，而是爱好和平的人民。
    特别令人不能容忍的，是美帝国主义公开侵略我国领土台湾，横暴地干涉我国内政。最近在一江山岛解放以后，美国侵略集团更一面直接参与蒋贼的军事行动，进一步对我国实行战争挑衅，一面又在联合国中策动“停火”诡计，通过他的伙伴制造出极端荒唐的“两个中国”的谬论，妄图迷惑舆论，以达侵占我国台湾的目的。美国这些无耻的侵略行为，不仅激起我国人民的极端愤怒，也一直为苏联坚决反对。去年中苏会谈后发表的两国政府联合宣言，苏联政府对美蒋条约发表的声明，以及最近苏联代表在联合国安全理事会上的建议，苏联外交部长莫洛托夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上的外交报告，都对美国侵略我国的行为提出了严厉的谴责，给我国人民正在进行的解放台湾的正义事业以有力的支持。苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁在他最近的演说里也说：“中国人民可以指望他们这一崇高的事业得到自己的忠实朋友——伟大的苏联人民的援助。”这样伟大的亲切的友谊，深深印入中国人民的心里，更加坚定了我国人民解放台湾的信念。我们坚决表示：无论美帝国主义是张牙舞爪的挑衅，或是进行伪善的欺骗，都丝毫不足以动摇我们解放台湾的决心。中国人民不解放台湾决不罢休。
    在庆祝中苏同盟五周年的日子里，我们各民主党派，各人民团体和其他爱国民主人士应该更加紧密地团结在中国共产党领导下，高度发扬爱国主义和国际主义精神，像保护眼珠一样来保护中苏两国的伟大友谊，继续巩固和加强以苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，为保卫祖国领土主权的完整，为反对原子战争及维护亚洲和世界和平的伟大事业而胜利前进。
