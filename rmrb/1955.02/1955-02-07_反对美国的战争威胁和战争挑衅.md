Vietnam's "People's Daily" Publishes Editorial
Firmly Supports the Chinese People's Position on Liberating Taiwan
Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 6th: Vietnam's "People's Daily" published an editorial on February 5th entitled "Firmly Support the Chinese People's Determined Position to Liberate Taiwan," stating: Taiwan, Penghu, and other islands along the Chinese coast are Chinese territory. This is proven historically, politically, legally, and practically. It is inevitable that the Chinese people will liberate these islands, and this is China's internal affair, which no country has the right to interfere with. However, American imperialism attempts to perpetually keep Taiwan, Penghu, and other islands under its rule, plotting to use these islands as military bases for its aggression against mainland China and other Asian countries.

The editorial then comments on New Zealand's proposal in the United Nations Security Council: New Zealand's proposal is a conspiracy by American imperialism to use the name of the United Nations to legalize interference in China's internal affairs and cover up acts of aggression against China. This proposal supports American aggression and is by no means a proposal for peace.

The editorial states: People who care about world peace earnestly hope that the Far East situation will ease and welcome the Soviet representative's proposal at the United Nations Security Council on January 31st. This proposal is entirely in line with the interests of the Chinese people, the Asian people, and the people of the world.

The editorial points out: If American imperialism stubbornly provokes and refuses to withdraw from Taiwan, Penghu, and other islands along the Chinese coast, and refuses to stop its acts of aggression against China, then it will suffer a great lesson.

The editorial concludes by emphasizing: Currently, Taiwan is a military base for American imperialism to threaten China and also to threaten Vietnam. The liberation of Taiwan will not only consolidate the peace and security of the Chinese people, but will also reduce a threat to the Vietnamese people and the people of Southeast Asia. The Vietnamese people, who are struggling to consolidate peace, achieve unification, and complete independence and democracy, fully support the just demands of the Chinese people and government and firmly support the Chinese people's position to liberate Taiwan and Penghu.

Polish "People's Tribune" Points Out
Only the Withdrawal of American Troops from Taiwan Can Ease Tensions
Xinhua News Agency, February 6th: TASS, Warsaw, February 5th: "People's Tribune" writes: "The only source of tension in the Taiwan Strait is American interference in China's internal affairs. Only by stopping this interference, only by the withdrawal of American troops from Taiwan, that is, by stopping the acts of aggression against China, can the tensions in this region be eliminated."

The newspaper says that the discussions in the United Nations Security Council prove that the United States and its supporters have no sincerity in truly discussing how to take measures to ease the tension in the Chinese coastal area. Only this can explain why the pro-American majority in the Security Council supported the American demand: not to discuss any proposal to expel the Kuomintang elements from the Security Council and invite representatives of the People's Republic of China.

"Voice of Labor" pointed out that if the Security Council wants to discuss the Taiwan issue, there can only be one way—to condemn American aggression in accordance with the Soviet proposal. In addition, the representative of People's China must occupy his rightful permanent seat in the Security Council, and the representatives of the Kuomintang clique, which the United States illegally supports, must be expelled. Any resolution passed by the Security Council on the Taiwan issue in the absence of Chinese representatives is illegal.

Burmese "Rangoon Daily" Publishes Editorial
Exposing the Political Deception of America's Cries for "Ceasefire"
Xinhua News Agency, February 6th: Rangoon News: The Burmese "Rangoon Daily" published an editorial on January 29th, denouncing America's "ceasefire" conspiracy, which aims to invade Taiwan. The editorial said: America is expanding the Seventh Fleet to "protect" Taiwan, and recently it has been clamoring for a "ceasefire." We cannot express sympathy for this kind of American political deception. The editorial accused the Americans of interfering in Asian affairs and attempting to undermine the unity of Asian countries. The editorial said that the American policy of division will not be welcomed by Asians. The editorial condemned the United States for obstructing China from entering the United Nations and condemned the United States for using the name of the United Nations to use Taiwan as a springboard for aggression.

British Social Organizations and Political Figures
Advocate Expelling the Traitor Chiang Kai-shek
Xinhua News Agency, February 6th: London News: Important British social organizations and political figures continue to advocate for the expulsion of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek.

The Scottish Committee of the British Cooperative Union, which has eleven million members, passed an emergency resolution in Dunfermline, Scotland, on the 5th, demanding that Chiang Kai-shek and his regime be expelled from Taiwan.

Edith Summerskill, Chairman of the British Labour Party, said in Lancing, South England, on the 5th, "Chiang Kai-shek should be told to get out immediately." Summerskill asked, "Are we going to allow this bogus government of Taiwan, which is merely administering an American base, to endanger world peace?" She said, "Now is the time to speak frankly. Chiang Kai-shek should be told that British workers will never fight against the workers of the recognized government of the People's Republic of China to support the demands of a discredited dictator." However, Summerskill went on to propose the idea of Taiwan's "neutralization," which the Chinese people have repeatedly declared they firmly oppose. Aneurin Bevan, a leader of the left wing of the British Labour Party, said at a miners' rally in Yorkshire on the 5th: "What we should be saying to America is that the way to peace is to disarm Chiang Kai-shek's forces on Taiwan."

Anthony Greenwood, a Labour Party centrist, said in Surrey on the 5th that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles should withdraw support for that "disreputable and conceited Chiang Kai-shek and tell him to jump into the Pacific." Greenwood also said that Dulles's judgment and diplomatic skills "are about the same as a buffalo," and that Dulles "is becoming an increasingly burdensome burden on Western countries."

Opinion circles in the British capital
Criticize Eden for Defending American Occupation of Chinese Territory
Xinhua News Agency, February 6th: According to TASS, London, February 6th: Democrats in the British capital believe that Foreign Secretary Eden's statement in the House of Commons on the 4th was a futile attempt to defend the American occupation of Chinese islands such as Taiwan and American acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China. In his statement, Eden insisted that "Taiwan and Penghu are territories where legal sovereignty is still uncertain or unresolved."

Commenting on Eden's statement, the "Daily Herald" wrote indignantly: "Eden, in saying these words, disregarded the fact that he himself had said that these islands were 'undoubtedly' part of China, and disregarded the fact that China was being attacked from these islands... Obviously, Eden is implying that if the Chinese want to recover these islands of their own, which are being used to attack them, they will be responsible for a situation that may have international consequences.

"Such a conclusion seems like a dream,... The situation that has been created makes it more urgent than ever for us to make it clear that the British people do not interfere in other countries' civil wars. They do not support the war caused by Chiang Kai-shek... because Chiang Kai-shek is only a puppet of the United States. Without American weapons and American naval cover, Chiang Kai-shek would not be able to stand on these islands, which could become the source of war."

Commenting on the United Nations Security Council meeting, the "News Chronicle" wrote in an editorial: "The current deadlock in New York is a direct and inevitable result of recognizing the Nationalist Chinese government (this newspaper so solemnly calls the Chiang Kai-shek elements) and not recognizing the Communist Chinese government. The world will no longer agree to a myth that is being used to obstruct one of the largest and strongest countries from participating in international organizations."

Labour MP Joe Binns said in London on the 4th that Eden's statement on the status of Taiwan created a ridiculous situation. Binns sarcastically pointed out that it was precisely based on the conclusion of American jurists that Taiwan was legally a part of China that the U.S. government signed a treaty with Chiang Kai-shek, whom it recognized as the "ruler of China," in December 1954, and is providing military assistance to the Kuomintang elements under this treaty.

Commenting on Eden's statement, the "Manchester Guardian's" diplomatic correspondent wrote: "No other British official statement has shown so clearly the difficult situation the British government is in. Eden essentially stated that if Beijing were to occupy territory that is recognized as belonging to it, it would be an action endangering peace. Not only people in Beijing, but also people elsewhere, will ask whether this danger is caused by the Chinese government wanting to take back its own islands, or by the American threat to obstruct it."

Editorial in U.S. "People's World" Says
The American People Are Unwilling to Sacrifice Their Sons for the Occupation of Taiwan
Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 6th: The U.S. "People's World" in San Francisco published an editorial on January 31st, saying: Congress can authorize the president to move the trigger when he pleases, but the people can stop the actual action.

We have no doubt that the American people are unwilling to sacrifice their sons, and possibly their homes, cities, and the civilization of the world, in some effort to cling to a Chinese coastal island.

The editorial said: Let the people speak. Let them clearly express their desire for peace and let the president know: the American people's current sentiment against the threatened war is even stronger than the gradual anger and disgust they felt towards the Korean War.

The editorial pointed out that some people in Washington are talking about a ceasefire. However, there is an insincere air to this talk. The editorial pointed out that, at the same time, Eisenhower is asking for unlimited power to wage war, which is the most provocative action ever taken by an American president in history. The editorial called on the government to fundamentally change its attitude. The editorial said that if our attitude towards "ceasefire" is based on bluff, intimidation, and blackmail, then it is doomed to fail, and the consequences will be incalculable.

    反对美国的战争威胁和战争挑衅
    越南“人民报”发表社论
    坚决支持中国人民解放台湾立场
    【新华社河内六日电】　越南“人民报”五日发表题为“坚决拥护中国人民坚决解放台湾的立场”的社论说：台湾、澎湖和中国沿海的其它岛屿是中国的领土，无论从历史上、政治上、法律上和实际上都证明了这一点。中国人民解放这些岛屿是必然的，这是中国的内政问题，任何国家都没有权利干涉。但是，美帝国主义企图永远把台湾、澎湖等岛屿放在它的统治之下，阴谋把这些岛屿作为它侵略中国大陆、侵略亚洲各国的军事基地。
    社论接着评论新西兰在联合国安全理事会上的建议说：新西兰的建议是美帝国主义企图利用联合国的名义使干涉中国内政合法化和掩盖侵略中国行动的一个阴谋，这个建议是支持美国侵略行动的，绝不是一项为了和平的建议。
    社论说：关心世界和平的人们都热切希望远东局势获得缓和，都欢迎一月三十一日苏联代表在联合国安全理事会上的建议。这一建议完全符合于中国人民和亚洲人民和全世界人民的利益。
    社论指出：如果美帝国主义顽固挑衅；不肯撤出台湾、澎湖和中国沿海其它岛屿，不肯停止对中国的侵略行动，那么它将遭到极大的教训。
    社论最后强调指出：现在，台湾是美帝国主义威胁中国、同时也威胁越南的一个军事基地。台湾的解放不仅将使中国人民的和平和安全获得巩固，而且越南人民和东南亚人民也将减少一个威胁。正在为巩固和平、实现统一、完成独立和民主而斗争的越南人民，完全支持中国人民和政府的正义主张，坚决拥护中国人民一定要解放台湾和澎湖的立场。波兰“人民论坛报”指出
    美国军队撤出台湾才能缓和紧张局势
    【新华社六日讯】　塔斯社华沙五日电：“人民论坛报”写道：“台湾海峡紧张局势的唯一来源是美国干涉中国内政，只有停止这种干涉，只有美国军队撤出台湾，也就是说停止对中国的侵略行动，这个地区的紧张局势才能消除。”
    报纸说，联合国安全理事会的讨论过程证明，美国和它的支持者并没有诚意真正讨论如何采取措施来和缓中国海岸地区的紧张局势。只有这才能说明，为什么安全理事会中的亲美多数支持美国的要求：不讨论把国民党分子驱逐出安全理事会和邀请中华人民共和国代表的任何建议。
    “劳动之声报”指出，如果安全理事会要想讨论台湾问题，那只能有一种方法——按照苏联建议谴责美国的侵略。此外，还必须由人民中国的代表占有他在安全理事会中应有的常任理事的席位，而把美国所非法支持的国民党集团的代表驱逐出去。在中国代表没有出席的情况下，安全理事会就台湾问题通过的任何决议都是非法的。缅甸“仰光日报”发表社论
    揭穿美国叫嚷“停火”的政治欺骗
    【新华社六日讯】　仰光消息：缅甸“仰光日报”一月二十九日发表社论，斥责美国目的在于侵略台湾的“停火”阴谋。社论说：美国扩大第七舰队“保护”台湾，最近又叫嚷“停火”。我们对于美国这种政治欺骗行动是不能表示同情的。社论指责美国人插手亚洲事务，企图破坏亚洲国家的团结。社论说，美国的分化政策不会受到亚洲人欢迎的。社论谴责美国阻挠中国进入联合国，并谴责美国利用联合国名义，以台湾作侵略跳板。英国社会团体和政界人士
    主张驱逐蒋介石卖国贼
    【新华社六日讯】　伦敦消息：英国重要社会团体和政界人士继续主张驱逐蒋介石卖国贼。
    拥有一千一百万人的英国合作社联盟的苏格兰委员会五日在苏格兰的顿菲莱茵通过了一个紧急决议，要求把蒋介石和他的政权逐出台湾。
    英国工党主席埃迪思·萨末斯基尔五日在南英格兰兰新说，“应该立刻通知蒋介石滚蛋”。萨末斯基尔问道，“难道我们允许这个只不过是管理一个美国基地的台湾冒牌政府来危害世界和平吗？”她说，“现在是坦白说话的时候了。应该告诉蒋介石说，英国工人们决不和已得到了承认的中华人民共和国政府的工人们作对来支持一个名誉扫地的独裁者的要求。”但是，萨末斯基尔接着又提出了为中国人民一再宣布坚决反对的台湾“中立化”的主张。英国工党左翼领袖比万五日在约克郡一个矿工的集会上说：“我们应该向美国说的是，谋求和平的方法是解除台湾蒋介石部队的武装。”
    工党中间派安东尼·格林伍德五日在萨利郡说，美国国务卿杜勒斯应该取消对那个“声名狼藉的和狂妄的蒋介石的支持，并且告诉他跳进太平洋里去。”格林伍德又说：杜勒斯的判断力和外交本领“就同水牛的差不多”，杜勒斯“愈来愈成为西方国家的一种累赘了”。英国首都的舆论界
    抨击艾登为美国占领中国领土作辩护
    【新华社六日讯】　据塔斯社伦敦六日讯：英国首都的民主人士认为，外交大臣艾登四日在下院的声明是徒劳无益地为美国对中国台湾等岛屿的占领和美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为作辩护。艾登在声明中硬说“台湾和澎湖是法律上的主权还不确定或尚未决定的领土”。
    “每日先驱报”在评论艾登这一声明时愤慨地写道：“艾登在说这些话时，竟不顾他自己也曾说过这些岛屿‘无疑’是中国的一部分，不顾中国正遭到来自这些岛屿的进攻这一事实……显然，艾登在暗示，如果中国人要收复这些被利用来进攻他们的、属于他们的岛屿的话，他们就要对可能产生国际后果的局势负责。
    “这样一个结论好像是梦话，……已经造成的局势使得我们空前迫切地需要明确地表明，英国人民不干涉他国内战。他们不支持蒋介石所引起的战争……因为蒋介石不过是美国的傀儡。没有美国的武器和美国海军的掩护，蒋介石是不能在这些可能成为战争的发源地的岛屿上站住脚的。”
    “新闻纪事报”就联合国安全理事会会议发表社论时写道：“目前在纽约造成的僵局是承认国民党中国政府（这家报纸如此郑重地称呼蒋介石分子）而不承认共产党中国政府的直接的必然结果。全世界再也不会同意一种神话，这种神话是被人利用来阻挠最大的、最强的国家之一参加国际机构的。”
    工党议员乔·宾恩四日在伦敦发表谈话说，艾登关于台湾地位的说法造成了一种可笑的局面。宾恩讽刺地指出，正是根据美国法律家认为台湾在法律上是中国的一个组成部分这样的结论，一九五四年十二月美国政府和它承认为“中国执政者”的蒋介石签订了一个条约，并根据这一条约正在给予国民党分子军事援助。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”外交评论家评论艾登的声明时写道：“任何其他的英国官方声明都没有如此清楚地表明英国政府所处的困难境地。艾登实质上等于声明，如果北京要占领被承认属于它的领土，这将是一种危及和平的行动。不仅是北京的人，就是其他地方的人也会问，这种危险是由于中国政府要拿回自己的岛屿而引起的呢，还是由于美国威胁要进行阻挠而引起的。”美国“人民世界报”社论说
    美国人民不愿意为侵占台湾牺牲儿子
    【新华社柏林六日电】　美国旧金山“人民世界报”在一月三十一日发表社论说：国会尽可以授权总统在他高兴的时候搬动枪机，人民却是能够制止住实际行动的。
    我们毫不怀疑，美国人民不愿意为了死抓住一个中国沿海岛屿不放的某种努力而牺牲他们的儿子，可能还有他们的家园、城市以及世界的文明。
    社论说：让人民说话吧。让他们明确表示他们的和平愿望，并且叫总统知道：美国人民现在反对威胁中的战争的情绪，比起当初他们对朝鲜战争逐渐产生的愤怒和厌恶更加强烈。
    社论指出，在华盛顿有人在谈论什么停火。但是，这种谈论有不诚恳的气息。社论指出，与此同时，艾森豪威尔却要求给他一种进行战争的无限制权力，这是历史上美国总统曾采取过的最富挑衅性的行动。社论要求政府根本改变它的态度。社论说，如果我们对“停火”的态度是基于虚张声势、恫吓和讹诈的话，那么它就注定要失败，而后果将是不可估量的。
