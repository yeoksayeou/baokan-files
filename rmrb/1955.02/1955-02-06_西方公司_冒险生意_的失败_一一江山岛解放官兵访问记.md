The Failure of Western Companies' "Risky Business"
—A Visit with the Liberation Soldiers of Yijiangshan Island
　　By our correspondent Jin Feng
    "Defense" and "Offense"—For the Benefit of the United States
    Before me is a crumpled, mimeographed newspaper captured during the battle of Yijiangshan Island, containing the "Propaganda Instructions" issued by the Taiwan pseudo-"Ministry of National Defense General Political Department" on December 3, 1954, regarding the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty":
    "The scope of this treaty currently applies only to Taiwan and Penghu, but it is stated that it will include other territories of the contracting parties upon agreement between the two parties. This provision can be flexibly applied as the situation evolves. Not only can it include the islands surrounding Taiwan and Penghu, but it may also include the entire territory of the Republic of China. It will not only not hinder our counterattack against the mainland, but can also serve as the basis for U.S. support for our national army's actions during the counterattack."
    The same newspaper carries another piece of news: "(Military News Agency, December 18th dispatch) A military spokesperson announced that our military actions against the coastal islands are not subject to any restrictions." The so-called "defense" of the U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" is precisely for "offense," for the U.S. support of Chiang's bandit army to "counterattack," "the basis for action." This is clearly stated in Taiwan's "Propaganda Instructions." Li Yadong, the former political instructor of the Direct Company of the 4th Assault Battalion of Yijiangshan who was liberated, also stammered: "The newspapers and broadcasts in Taiwan all said that with the signing of the Mutual Defense Treaty, the 'counterattack' against the mainland was guaranteed."
    The more important point that the Taiwan "Propaganda Instructions" did not mention is that whether it is "defense" or "offense," it is actually for the benefit of the United States. Wang Fubi, the former commander of the 4th Assault Battalion of Yijiangshan Island, said with a wry smile: "The United States is asking us to fight the world for them."
    It turned out that the one directly supplying his battalion and the other five assault battalions on the coastal islands with weapons, ammunition, training them, and commanding them to "fight the world" for the United States was the U.S. intelligence agency stationed in Taiwan and the coastal islands of China—the "Western Enterprises Company," or "Western Company" for short.
    Special Agent Training by the "Western Company"
    As early as 1951, the Western Company assisted the pseudo-"Ministry of National Defense" in Danshui, Taiwan, in organizing the so-called "Guerrilla Cadre Training Class," and began the sinister preparation for the "risky business" of sending special agents to mainland China to carry out sabotage activities. The head of the class was the traitor Chiang Kai-shek's intelligence chief Zheng Jiemin, and the actual person in charge was the head of the "Western Company," the American special agent Piers. Liu Wuzhong, the former operations chief of the "Yijiangshan Area Command" who was liberated this time, received training in the second phase of the advanced team of this "Guerrilla Cadre Training Class" from July to August 1951. The "instructors" of the training class were more than a dozen Americans. The training class was divided into advanced team, communications team, demolition team, intelligence team, instructor team, psychological warfare team, etc. All equipment and supplies were provided by the United States. American "instructors" such as Sams and Gannard directly taught Liu Wuzhong. The main subject of the advanced team was to study so-called "guerrilla tactics." Piers often said to them: "You fight the Communists, and we will help you and equip you." Liu Keying, the former political officer of the political office of the "4th Assault Battalion" of Yijiangshan, who was also liberated this time, received training in the psychological warfare team of this "Guerrilla Cadre Training Class" from June to July 1952. The training content included slogans and leaflets, news and broadcasting, receiving and sending reports, etc., as well as "rumor-mongering and rumor-chasing," which was one of the main courses of psychological warfare, and was taught personally by the American instructor Gannard. The content he talked about included the source of rumors, the background of rumor-mongering, how to use mass psychology and create various rumors according to environmental needs... a total of eight hours.
    The largest-scale activity of the "Western Company" was the training of Kuomintang troops entrenched in the coastal islands of Zhejiang in Dachen Island in 1952. Hu Zongnan, a big boss of Chiang's bandits, came forward, and the "Western Company" was actually in charge. The so-called "Southeast Training Group" was organized. One term lasted more than three months, and one battalion was trained per term. A total of six assault battalions, one special agent battalion (specializing in special agent activities such as intelligence, demolition, and communication), and one artillery battalion were reorganized. The officers and soldiers of the 4th Assault Battalion and the 2nd Assault Battalion stationed in Yijiangshan this time have all received training from the "Western Company." The main content of the reorganization was the use and maintenance of weapons, landing warfare and counter-landing warfare, and general communication liaison. Piers, the head of the "Western Company" stationed in Taiwan, often went to Dachen Island to see how they shot, how they used submachine guns, carbines, 60 mortars and rocket launchers, and checked whether their bullets were clean. The American instructors were sent by the "Western Company," and the Chiang bandit instructors were also trained in the "Instructor Team" of the "Guerrilla Cadre Training Class" run by the "Western Company" in Danshui. After the reorganized assault battalion was stationed on Yijiangshan, Pishan, Yushan, and Nanfu islands around Dachen. It was jointly led by the "Western Company" and the "Dachen Defense Area Command." The weapons, ammunition, and communication equipment of the assault battalion were directly supplied by the "Western Company." The "Western Company" had its own warehouses in Taiwan and Dachen. The purpose of the "Western Company" in training and controlling these guerrilla forces was to form an intelligence encirclement network in the southeast coast of China through them, and directly carry out various special agent intelligence activities against the new China.
    The "Assault" of the Landing Platoon
    Under the special agent battalion controlled by the "Western Company," there was a landing company and a landing platoon, which were selected from various assault battalions and were composed of people from Wenling, Dongtou, Yuhuan, Wenzhou, Linhai and other areas along the coast of Zhejiang. From November 1953 to October 1954, the "Western Company" trained them in Dachen for nearly a year. The training courses included the use and principles of weapons, skirmish warfare, sea landing warfare, beach warfare, demolition, communication, swimming, stabbing rubber tires, boxing, etc. Xiao Xizhen, Huang Changwan, Wu Jinguo, Chen Zhide, Hou Annan and other fifteen soldiers of the 4th Assault Battalion of Yijiangshan who were liberated were all soldiers of this landing platoon. The direct purpose of the "Western Company" in training them was to prepare them to use armed attacks to obtain intelligence.
    At 9:00 p.m. on October 21, 1954, an American motor sailboat, the "Blue Angel," carrying the officers and soldiers of the landing platoon, departed from Zhuyu, a small island near Xia Dachen. The next day, they arrived at Nanfu. After resting for one night, they left Nanfu and boarded a warship on the evening of the 23rd, heading towards the mainland. At midnight, the warship approached the sea off Pingyang County, Zhejiang. It was dark, the wind was strong, and there was thick fog. They got off the warship and boarded the "Blue Angel" again, quietly advancing towards the coast. Entering the harbor, signal soldier Xiao Xizhen and acting platoon deputy Lin Quan got on a rubber boat and quietly rowed forward on the water. The four classes behind them were sitting separately on four sampans. Their original plan was for the first and second classes to be responsible for the attack, the fourth class to provide fire cover, and the third class to be a reserve, preparing to encircle one of our platoons and capture our live intelligence. It was dark and foggy. Platoon leader Cai Ying misjudged the reef. The first class went against the current and never landed. The second class mistakenly touched a large village and was surrounded by our public security forces. One was killed, five were injured, and three were captured. The fourth class took the wrong path and quickly retreated. Gunshots broke out in the back, and several more people were shot and killed in the sea. The assault failed. When they came back, the platoon leader and the squad leader blamed each other. The platoon leader scolded the squad leader for being useless, and the squad leader said that the platoon leader's command was improper. Waiting on the warship were representatives of the "Dachen Defense Area Command" and the "Western Company." The platoon leader was so scared that he wanted to jump into the sea to commit suicide. As a result, he was given two major demerits and demoted to the hard labor team as a captain.
    The Failure of "Risky Business"—Total Annihilation
    This "assault" failure was only one of the many unsuccessful "risky businesses" of the "Western Company." Naturally, it could not diminish their "confidence" at all. However, the bombs falling on Dachen and the continuous artillery fire of the People's Liberation Army's coastal artillery towards Yijiangshan Island did make the representatives of the "Western Company" somewhat panicked. The main force of the assault battalion—the 4th Assault Battalion—was transferred to Yijiangshan Island, and the entire landing platoon was also transferred to Yijiangshan Island to strengthen the defense. The representative of the "Western Company" also accompanied Yu Dawei, the Chiang bandit "Minister of National Defense" who had just returned from the United States, to Yijiangshan Island late at night to boost morale. Yu Dawei instructed Wang Shengming, the "Commander of the Yijiangshan Defense Area," and Wang Fubi, the commander of the 4th Assault Battalion, and others: "Yijiang is the gateway to Dachen, and Dachen is the barrier to Taiwan. If Yijiang is not defended, Dachen will be difficult to defend. If Dachen falls, Taiwan will be in danger. Your responsibilities are heavy, and I hope you will work hard." The representative of the "Western Company" said: "Yijiangshan is the starting point for the counterattack, and God will bless you!"
    It seems that the "Western Company" this time had no choice but to bet on God's blessing. This bet was naturally destined to fail.
    At more than 8:00 a.m. on January 18, 1955, a large number of our aircraft came to the airspace over Yijiangshan Island to bomb. The entire island was shrouded in smoke, and communication was cut off by the bombing. Wang Fubi, the commander of the 4th Assault Battalion, was unable to command from the beginning. After the plane bombing, the artillery continued to bombard back and forth. The telephone line between him and the "Area Commander" was broken. He was trapped in the command post and could not do anything. The artillery fire became more and more intense and closer. His house was shattered by the shock. The director of the battalion political office said to him: "We have to make final preparations." At this time, the People's Liberation Army's landing troops had taken the beachhead and approached the command post. Wang Fubi had to lay down his weapons. At this time, Wang Wuzhong, the operations chief of the "Yijiang Area Command," and Ge Renjie, the director of the office, were hiding together in a bunker in the mountains. They saw people outside shooting at the bunker and thought they were their own subordinates, and shouted repeatedly: "Don't shoot indiscriminately!" When they saw the five-pointed star on the brim of the hat, they had to raise their hands. The chemical artillery and howitzer positions in Nanjiang were all blown down by the planes. Without firing a single shot, the People's Liberation Army landed. Chen Dongnian, the "instructor" of the chemical artillery team, squatted in the air-raid shelter for four hours. When he came out and saw the shells of our landing troops flying towards Beijiang, he thought it was his own artillery firing. When he also discovered the five-pointed star, he panicked and had to surrender his gun. Xie Agou, a fisherman who was captured, heard the plane bombing and hid alone in a single-person air-raid shelter, using a quilt to tightly block the air-raid shelter. Hearing the gunshots, he said: "Okay, okay, the Liberation Army has landed!" He quickly wrapped up the bullets and walked out to hand over one hundred and eighty bullets and a gun to the Liberation Army. Only a few bunkers were still resisting, firing bullets outwards, and finally they were all cleared out. The entire 4th Assault Battalion and a company of the 2nd Assault Battalion, which were trained by the U.S. imperialist special agent agency—the "Western Company"—as capital for "risky business," were completely annihilated in this way.

    西方公司“冒险生意”的失败
    —一一江山岛解放官兵访问记
  　本报记者　金凤
    “防御”和“进攻”——为了美国的利益
    在我的面前是一张揉皱了的一江山岛战斗中缴获来的油印报纸，上面登着台湾伪“国防部总政治部”一九五四年十二月三日发的关于美蒋“共同防御条约”的“宣传指示”：
    “此约适用范围，目前确仅限于台澎，但言明经双方协议，将包括缔约国其他领土。此项规定自可视情势演变，灵活运用。不但进可包括台澎外围各岛屿，且或可包括整个中华民国领土，不但无碍我反攻大陆，且可作为我反攻时美国支援国军行动之依据。
    同一张报纸上登着另一条消息：“（军闻社十二月十八日电）军事发言人宣布说，我对沿海小岛采取军事行动不受任何约束。”美蒋“共同防御条约”的所谓“防御”，恰恰是为了“进攻”，为了美国支援蒋贼军“反攻”，“行动之依据”。这在台湾的“宣传指示”中已经写得明明白白的了。解放过来的原一江山突击第四大队直属中队指导员李亚东也结结巴巴地说：“台湾的报纸和广播都是这么说的，订了共同防御条约，‘反攻’大陆就有了保证。”
    而台湾的“宣传指示”所没有写出来的更主要的一点，是无论是“防御”和“进攻”，其实都是为了美国的利益。原一江山突击第四大队大队长王辅弼就苦笑着说：“美国叫我们给它打天下。”
    原来直接供给他的大队和沿海岛屿其他五个突击大队武器、弹药，训练他们和指挥他们为美国“打天下”的，就是美国驻台湾和中国沿海岛屿的特务机关——“西方企业公司”简称“西方公司”。
    “西方公司”的特务训练
    一九五一年西方公司就在台湾淡水协助伪“国防部”举办了所谓“游击干部训练班”，开始了向我国大陆派遣特务进行破坏活动的“冒险生意”的罪恶准备，班主任是卖国贼蒋介石的特务头子郑介民，实际负责人是“西方公司”的头子美国特务皮埃士。这次解放过来的原“一江山地区司令部”作战组长刘五中，一九五一年七月到八月就在这个“游击干部训练班”高级队的第二期受训。训练班的“教官”有十多个美国人，训练班分高级队、通讯队、爆破队、情报队、教官队、心理作战队等，装备和供给全部由美国来。直接给刘五中上过课的美国“教官”有桑姆士、甘纳德等，高级队的主要课目是研究所谓“游击战术”。皮埃士常常对他们说：“你们打共产党，我们帮助你们，装备你们。”也是这次解放过来的原一江山“突击第四大队”政治室政治干事刘克影，在一九五二年六月至七月曾在这个“游干班”的心理作战队受训，训练的内容有标语和传单，新闻和广播，收报和发报等等，还有作为心理作战主要课程之一的“造谣和追谣”，是由美国教官甘纳德亲自担任的。他讲的内容有谣言的来源，造谣的背景，如何利用群众心理、根据环境需要制造各种谣言……一共讲了八个小时。
      “西方公司”最大规模的活动，是一九五二年在大陈岛训练国民党盘踞在浙江沿海岛屿的游杂部队。由蒋贼的大头目胡宗南出面，“西方公司”实际负责，主办了所谓“东南训练团”。三个多月一期，每期训练一个大队，一共整编了六个突击大队、一个特务大队（专门搞情报爆破通讯等特务活动）和一个炮兵大队。这次解放过来原驻一江山的突击第四大队和第二大队的官兵就都受过“西方公司”的整训。整训的主要内容是武器的使用和保养、登陆战和反登陆战、一般的通讯连络等。驻台湾的“西方公司”头子皮埃士那时常常到大陈岛来看他们如何射击、打靶，如何使用冲锋枪、卡宾枪、六零炮和火箭筒，检查他们子弹擦得干净不干净。美国教官是“西方公司”派来的，蒋贼教官也是“西方公司”在淡水办的“游击干部训练班”的“教官队”中训练出来的。经过整编以后的突击大队，分驻大陈外围的一江山、披山、渔山、南凫等岛屿。由“西方公司”和“大陈防卫区司令部”共同领导，突击大队的武器弹药通讯器材，一直都由“西方公司”直接供给。“西方公司”在台湾和大陈都有自己的仓库，“西方公司”训练和掌握这些游击部队的目的，是通过他们在我国东南沿海形成情报包围网，直接向新中国进行各种特务情报活动。
    登陆排的“突击”
    在“西方公司”掌握的特务大队下面，有一个登陆连和登陆排，是从各突击大队挑选出来都是浙江沿海温岭、洞头、玉环、温州、临海一带的人组成的。从一九五三年十一月到一九五四年十月，“西方公司”在大陈训练他们将近一年，训练的课程有武器的使用与原理、散兵作战、海上登陆战、滩头战、爆破、通讯、游泳、刺橡皮胎、打拳等，一江山解放过来的突击第四大队士兵萧锡珍、黄长宛、吴金国、陈志德、侯安南等十五人都是这个登陆排的士兵，“西方公司”训练他们的直接目的，是准备使用他们用武装袭击的方式来获得情报。
    一九五四年十月二十一日晚上九点钟，一只美国的机帆船“蓝天使号”载着登陆排的官兵，从下大陈附近的小岛竹屿出发了。第二天，他们到了南凫，休息一夜后，二十三日晚上离开南凫上了兵舰，向大陆方向出发。深夜十二点，兵舰开近浙江沿海平阳县的海面。天黑风大，浓雾茫茫，他们下了兵舰，又上了“蓝天使号”，向着海岸悄悄行进。进了港湾，传令兵萧锡珍和代理排副林权上了橡皮船，无声地在水面上划着前进，后面四个班分开坐在四个舢舨上。他们原定的计划是一、二班担任攻击，四班火力掩护，三班是后备，准备包围我们一个排，抓我们的活情报。天黑雾浓，排长蔡英看错了礁，第一班逆流而上，始终没有登陆。第二班错摸到了一个大村庄，被我公安部队包围，打死一个、打伤五个、俘虏三名。第四班摸错了路，赶紧撤回，后面枪声大发，又有好几名被打死在海中。突击未成，回来的时候，排长和班长互相埋怨，排长骂班长不中用，班长说排长指挥不当，在兵舰上等待着的有“大陈防卫地区司令部”和“西方公司”的代表，排长怕得要跳海自杀，结果记了两个大过，降职到苦役队去当队长。
    “冒险生意”的失败——全军覆没
    这次的“突击”失败，只是“西方公司”的许多次“冒险生意”中不成功的一次，自然并不能稍减他们的“信心”，只是落在大陈的炸弹和人民解放军海岸炮兵向一江山岛的连续炮击，却使“西方公司”的代表确实有些惊慌了。突击大队的主力——第四大队调防到了一江山岛，登陆排也全部抽到一江山岛来加强防务。“西方公司”的代表又陪着刚从美国回来的蒋贼“国防部”部长俞大维深夜来到一江山岛鼓励士气。俞大维对“一江山防守地区司令”王生明和突击第四大队队长王辅弼等训话说：“一江是大陈的门户，大陈是台湾的屏障，一江不保，大陈难守。大陈失守，台湾垂危。你们职责重大，望你们善自努力。”“西方公司”的代表说：“一江山是反攻的起点，上帝会保佑你们！”
    看起来“西方公司”这一次是把赌注无可奈何地押在上帝保佑上了，这赌注自然注定要落空的。
      一九五五年一月十八日上午八点多钟，我军大批飞机来到一江山岛上空轰炸，全岛烟雾沉沉，通讯联络都炸断了。突击第四大队大队长王辅弼一开始就无法指挥。飞机轰炸以后，大炮接着又来回的轰击，他和“地区司令”之间的电话线断了，他困守指挥所无法可施，炮火愈来愈猛，愈来愈近，他的房子被震破了，大队政治室主任对他说：“我们要作最后打算。”这时，解放军登陆部队已拿下滩头阵地，迫近指挥所。王辅弼只得放下武器。这时，“一江地区司令部”作战组长王五中和办公室主任葛仁杰正一起躲在一个山中的碉堡里，他们看到外面向碉堡打枪，以为是自己部下，还连声喝着：“不要乱打！”等到看到了帽檐上的五角星，他们只得举起手来。在南江的化学炮和榴弹炮阵地都被飞机炸塌，一炮未发，人民解放军就登陆了。化学炮兵队的“指导员”陈冬年在防空洞蹲了四个钟头，出来看到我登陆部队的炮弹飞向北江，还以为是自己的炮发射了。等到他也同样发现了五角星，慌慌张张也只得缴枪了。而被抓去的渔民谢阿狗听到飞机轰炸，就独自躲在一个单人防空洞里，用棉被将防空洞严密地塞起来。听到打枪，他说：“好了，好了，解放军上了岸了！”他连忙把子弹包扎好，走出来将一百八十粒子弹连枪交给了解放军。只有一部分碉堡还在顽抗，向外发射枪弹，最后也终于被肃清了。被美帝国主义者的特务机关——“西方公司”一手训练出来作为“冒险生意”资本的突击第四大队全部和第二大队一个中队，就这样全部覆没了。
