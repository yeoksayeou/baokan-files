One of the main objectives of the United States in convening a meeting of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) countries in Bangkok is to use this aggressive military bloc to further interfere in the situation in Indochina and advance the conspiracy to sabotage the Geneva Accords that it has been carrying out there.

Since the Geneva Conference, the United States has been increasingly brazen in its conspiracy to sabotage the Geneva Accords in Indochina. It has openly given South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia hundreds of millions of dollars in direct military "aid," strengthened the military forces of South Vietnam, instigated French colonial elements and the Ngo Dinh Diem government to continue detaining prisoners of war and political prisoners, endlessly subjected patriotic elements and civilians to retaliation and massacres, colluded with the Ngo Dinh Diem armed forces in large-scale looting of residents in North Vietnam, and sent military personnel to directly participate in the destruction and looting of public property in Haiphong and other places. In Cambodia, the United States and the Cambodian government signed an agreement to "assist" it in building a "modern port," apparently attempting to establish a U.S. naval base there. In Laos, the United States even sent aircraft to airdrop war materiel to support the Laotian armed forces in attacking the regrouping areas of the Lao Fighting Units in Muong Phanh and other places.

Recently, on the eve of the Bangkok meeting, U.S. intervention and aggression in Indochina have become even more rampant. U.S. President Eisenhower’s "special envoy" to South Vietnam, Collins, went to Washington and consulted with the highest U.S. authorities, and recently brought back to Saigon a large-scale intervention plan approved by Washington. According to various sources, this plan intends to turn South Vietnam into a second South Korea in terms of military, political, and economic aspects. A United Press International correspondent in Saigon once reported that the United States' goal was to "establish a fighting machine in Southeast Asia similar to that of South Korea."

According to Collins' military plan, which has already been revealed, the United States will turn South Vietnam's armed forces into a completely Americanized attack force under its control and will greatly strengthen its strength. The plan stipulates that the existing forces in South Vietnam will be reorganized into an army of 140,000 men by the end of this year. This army will be equipped by the United States and will be fully responsible by the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group, with the assistance of some French officers, and will be organized and trained according to American methods. Some South Vietnamese air force personnel may also be sent to the United States for training. At the same time, the United States also plans to help South Vietnam establish a "reserve force" of 150,000 men this year and establish many "local police forces" throughout South Vietnam.

United Press International once revealed that Collins' first intention in reorganizing the South Vietnamese army was to establish a military reign of terror in South Vietnam, stifle the people's democratic freedom, and "eliminate communism there before the Vietnam elections in 1956." He plans to divide the reorganized South Vietnamese army into highly mobile companies, equipped with a large number of jeeps, automatic weapons, and communication equipment, so that they can quickly penetrate into rural areas, massacre the South Vietnamese people, and turn the villages and towns there into slaughterhouses for the U.S. aggression group. The "police force" he is creating will be used to maintain daily terror rule. Collins openly stated that this plan was carried out in accordance with the "experience gained by the United States in Korea and Greece."

According to this experience, all desires and actions for freedom, independence, democracy, and peace will be ruthlessly suppressed under the pretext of "communist subversion." It is evident that the United States' intention is to undermine the free elections in Vietnam stipulated in the Geneva Conference agreements by strengthening the military suppression forces in South Vietnam, to obstruct the legitimate desire of the Vietnamese people to achieve peaceful and democratic unification, and to impose the anti-national and anti-people regime selected by the United States on the Vietnamese people.

Moreover, the armed forces of South Vietnam controlled and equipped by the United States will, like the Syngman Rhee army, become tools for implementing the U.S. war plan and creating tension. The head of the U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in South Vietnam, O'Daniel, publicly stated on December 27 last year: "The military organization and armament of South Vietnam is a link in the defensive (!) chain that we have built to oppose communism." Collins even clamored on January 30 this year: South Vietnamese troops "if encouraged, will also fight the Communists." Therefore, the British "Tribune" weekly did not say without grounds that the United States "will encourage" the South Vietnamese authorities "to violate the terms of the Geneva Accords and re-launch the Indochina War" when "necessary."

Coordinating with these military arrangements, the U.S. plan also stipulates a series of measures to comprehensively interfere in all aspects of South Vietnam's internal affairs. These include a "financial reform" plan to enable U.S. monopoly capital to replace France and control South Vietnam's finances and economy, and a plan to establish a "National Assembly" in South Vietnam like the Syngman Rhee government.

In short, the Collins plan is to transplant the entire set of methods that the United States has implemented in South Korea to South Vietnam, even intensifying it, in order to create a situation there like South Korea, turning South Vietnam into a U.S. colony and military base, making it impossible to restore Vietnam's national unity and complete independence through peaceful and democratic means as stipulated in the armistice agreement. The U.S. plan to split Vietnam and turn South Vietnam, as well as Laos and Cambodia, into its colonies and military bases is part of its overall plan to create new tensions in Asia, prepare for new wars, and expand aggression against Asia. Now, the United States also wants to use the Bangkok meeting to sabotage the Geneva Accords, obstruct the general elections and unification of Vietnam and Laos, and drag South Vietnam and Laos and Cambodia into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc.

The nature of these activities by the United States in Indochina, which violate the Geneva Accords, is very clear. Precisely because of this, it has been spreading rumors, falsely accusing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam of violating the Geneva Accords, and vigorously clamoring about the "aggression threat" of the People's Republic of China to Southeast Asia, fabricating various lies to describe China's national autonomy system, which is common throughout the country, as a "Free Thai Movement." It is falsely accusing the troops stationed within the Chinese border of being for "aggression." The U.S. aim is to use this to cover up its criminal actions of preparing for an Asian war by violating the Geneva Accords. In particular, it wants to use this clamor to drag South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia into this Southeast Asian aggressive bloc and turn them into U.S. military bases. However, this kind of slander and libel that distorts the truth can never conceal the war nature of the U.S. aggressive group and its followers who are conspiring to tear up the Geneva Accords inside and outside the Bangkok meeting.

For quite some time, the U.S. aggressive group has been engaged in a sharp struggle with France in seizing political, economic, and military control of South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, inching forward to squeeze out France's position there. Therefore, this Collins plan, which further requires France to relinquish its position, has caused great anxiety in France. United Press International revealed on January 31 that France was "concerned that the United States would 'Americanize' South Vietnam and exclude all remaining French influence." However, under the pressure of money, the French ruling group has repeatedly yielded to the United States. According to the recent agreement between the United States and France, starting from January 1 this year, U.S. "aid" to Indochina will no longer be given through France, but directly to the authorities of South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, thereby allowing the United States to directly control their finances and economy. Then, France handed over all military power and announced the transfer of command of the South Vietnamese army to the Ngo Dinh Diem group, which is manipulated by the United States.

It must be pointed out that without the support of Britain and the acquiescence of France, the U.S. aggressive group would not be able to violate the Geneva Accords so brazenly in Indochina. Britain and France participated in the Manila Treaty and its protocol, and now they are participating in the Bangkok meeting to plan further violations of the Geneva Accords by the United States, which is incompatible with their responsibility to ensure the implementation of the Geneva Accords.

There is no doubt that this conspiracy of the United States and its followers to interfere in the affairs of Asian countries and threaten peace in Southeast Asia cannot be tolerated by the people of Indochina and all peace-loving countries and peoples. The prime ministers of Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan declared in the communique of the Bogor Conference last December: "Hope that the Geneva Accords will be fully respected and implemented by all parties concerned, and hope that no external interference will hinder the successful implementation of these agreements." This reflects the common demands of the people of Southeast Asian countries. However, the conspiracy that the United States intends to plot at the Bangkok meeting with other countries in the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc runs counter to this legitimate desire of the people, and is therefore widely condemned by public opinion in Asian countries. For example, the "Hindustan Times" believes that the Bangkok meeting "will definitely further increase international tension."

In a statement issued on the 22nd, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam stated: "The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly oppose the Bangkok meeting and strongly protest against the activities of the U.S. imperialists in undermining the Geneva armistice agreement." The Chinese people and the Asian people firmly support this just stand of the Indochinese people. They must work with the Indochinese people with greater efforts to stop the U.S. conspiracy plan and maintain the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords.

    必须制止美国破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋
    李高
    美国召集东南亚条约组织国家在曼谷举行会议的主要目的之一，是运用这个侵略性军事集团来进一步干涉印度支那的局势，推进它一直在那里进行的破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋活动。
    日内瓦会议以后，美国日益放肆地在印度支那进行破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋活动。它公然给予南越、老挝和柬埔寨数亿美元的直接军事“援助”，加强南越军事力量；唆使法国殖民分子和吴庭艳政府继续扣留战俘和政治犯；无休止地向爱国分子和平民施行报复和屠杀；协同吴庭艳武装部队大规模地强劫北越的居民；派出军事人员直接参与破坏和劫走海防等处的公共财产。在柬埔寨，美国和柬埔寨政府签订了一个“援助”它建立一个“现代化港口”的协定，显然是企图在那里设置一个美国海军基地。在老挝，美国竟派出飞机空投作战物资来支持老挝的武装部队进攻寮国战斗部队的集结地区芒奔等地。
    最近，在曼谷会议举行的前夕，美国对印度支那的干涉活动和侵略活动更加猖狂了。美国总统派驻南越的“特使”柯林斯曾到华盛顿和美国最高当局作了计议，他最近回到西贡时带来了华盛顿批准的一个大规模的干涉计划。按照各方面的消息透露，这个计划是打算从军事、政治和经济各方面把南越变为第二个南朝鲜。合众社驻西贡记者就曾经报道说：美国的目的是要“在东南亚建立一个类似南朝鲜的那种作战机器”。
    按照已经透露出来的柯林斯的军事计划，美国将把南越的武装变成在它掌握下的一支完全美国化的攻击部队，并要大大加强它的实力。计划规定在今年年底前把南越现有部队改编为包括十四万人的陆军。这支军队将由美国装备，并由美国军事援助顾问团负全责，在一些法国军官的协助下，按照美国的方法进行组织和训练。部分南越空军人员并可能被送往美国受训。与此同时，美国还拟在今年帮助南越建立一支十五万人的“后备部队”，并在南越各地建立许多“地方警察部队”。
    合众社曾经透露：柯林斯策划改编南越军队的第一个用意，就是要在南越建立军事恐怖统治，扼杀人民的民主自由，“在一九五六年越南举行选举以前清除那里的共产主义”。他计划把重新组织后的南越军队分成机动性很强的连队，配备大量吉普车、自动武器和通讯装备，以便能迅速地深入乡村地区去，血洗南越人民，把那里的村庄和城镇变成美国侵略集团的屠宰场。他搞的“警察部队”将用来保持日常的恐怖统治。柯林斯公开说，这个计划是按照美国“在朝鲜和希腊取得的经验进行”的。
    按照这个经验，一切要求自由、独立、民主、和平的愿望和行动都要一律以“共产党颠覆活动”的罪名受到残酷的镇压。显而易见，美国的意图是要用加强南越军事镇压力量的方法来破坏日内瓦会议协议所规定的越南自由选举，阻挠越南人民实现和平民主统一的合法愿望，把美国所选择的反民族、反人民的政权强加到越南人民头上。
    不仅如此，美国控制和装备的南越的武装部队将同李承晚军队一样，成为执行美国战争计划、制造紧张局势的工具。美国驻南越的军事援助顾问团团长奥丹尼尔在去年十二月二十七日公开说：“南越的军事组织和武装是我们为了反对共产主义而建立的防御（！）锁链”中的一环。柯林斯在今年一月三十日竟叫嚣：南越军队“如果予以鼓励的话，他们也将会和共产党作战”。因此，英国“论坛”周刊不是没有根据地说：美国在“必要时”“将鼓励”南越当局“破坏日内瓦协定条款，并重新发动印度支那战争”。
    配合着这些军事方面的安排，美国的计划还规定了全面地干涉南越内部事务的各个方面的一系列措施。其中包括使美国垄断资本得以取代法国而控制南越财政经济的“财政改革”计划，和在南越建立李承晚政府式的“国民议会”的计划。
    总而言之，柯林斯计划是把美国在南朝鲜所施行的一套，全部搬到南越去，甚至变本加厉，以便在那里造成一个和南朝鲜一样的局面，把南越变成为美国的殖民地和军事基地，而使停战协定所规定的以和平民主的方法恢复越南民族统一和全部独立成为不可能。美国企图分裂越南，把南越以及老挝、柬埔寨都变成为它的殖民地和军事基地的计划，是它的在亚洲制造新的紧张局势，准备新的战争和扩大对亚洲的侵略的总计划的一部分。现在美国还想利用曼谷会议来破坏日内瓦协议，阻挠越南、老挝的普选和统一，并把南越和老挝、柬埔寨拉入东南亚侵略集团。
    美国在印度支那的这些活动，其破坏日内瓦协议的性质是十分明显的，正是因为这样，它就大事散布空气，反咬越南民主共和国破坏日内瓦协议，并且极力叫嚣什么中华人民共和国对东南亚的“侵略威胁”，制造各种谎言把中国在全国通行的民族自治制度说成是要搞什么“自由泰国运动”。诬赖中国国境内的驻军是为了“侵略”。美国的目的就是企图借此来为它破坏日内瓦协议准备亚洲战争的罪恶行为打掩护。特别是他的想利用这种叫嚷来把南越、老挝和柬埔寨拉进这个东南亚侵略集团，把它们变成美国的军事基地。但是，这种颠倒黑白的造谣诽谤，决不可能掩盖美国侵略集团和它的追随者在曼谷会议内外阴谋撕毁日内瓦协议的战争实质。
    相当一个时期以来，美国侵略集团在攫取南越、老挝和柬埔寨的政治、经济和军事控制权中，和法国进行了尖锐的斗争，得寸进尺地排挤法国在那里的地位。所以这个进一步要法国让出地位的柯林斯计划使法国大为不安。合众社一月三十一日透露法国“担心美国会使南越‘美国化’，并且排除一切剩余的法国影响”。但法国统治集团在金元的压力下，一再向美国屈服。根据美法之间最近的协议，从今年一月一日开始，美国给予印度支那的“援助”不再通过法国而直接给予南越、老挝和柬埔寨当局，从而使美国直接掌握着它们的财政经济。接着，法国又全部交出了军权，宣布把南越的军队指挥权移交给由美国一手操纵的吴庭艳集团。
    必须指出，如果没有英国的支持和法国的屈从，美国侵略集团是不可能在印度支那这样放肆地破坏日内瓦协议的。英国和法国参加了马尼拉条约及其议定书，现在又在曼谷会议上参预美国进一步破坏日内瓦协议的策划，这是和它们所承担的保证日内瓦协议的实施的责任不能相容的。
    毫无疑问，美国及其追随者这种干涉亚洲国家事务，威胁东南亚和平的阴谋，是印度支那各国人民以及一切爱好和平的国家和人民所不能容许的。缅甸、锡兰、印度、印度尼西亚和巴基斯坦的总理在去年十二月茂物会议的公报中宣布：“希望日内瓦协定将受到所有有关方面的充分尊重和履行，并且希望不会有外来的干涉阻碍成功地履行这些协议”。这是反映了东南亚各国人民的共同要求的。可是，美国打算在曼谷会议上伙同东南亚侵略集团其他国家策划的阴谋，恰恰和人民的这种正当愿望背道而驰，因此受到亚洲国家舆论的广泛谴责。例如，“印度斯坦时报”就认为，曼谷会议“一定会更进一步增加国际紧张局势”。
    越南民主共和国外交部在二十二日发表的声明中表示：“越南人民和越南民主共和国政府坚决反对曼谷会议，并且强烈抗议美帝国主义者的破坏日内瓦停战协定的活动。”中国人民和亚洲人民坚决支持印度支那人民这种正义的立场，他们一定要和印度支那人民一起，以更大的努力来制止美国的阴谋计划，维护日内瓦协议的彻底实施。
