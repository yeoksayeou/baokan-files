    Oppose Layer Upon Layer of Increased Tasks
    Jiang Xia
    At the end of last year, the Henan Province banking system handled the "Grain and Cotton Preferential Savings" business. This was a very beneficial thing for the peasants, but many bank staff members handled it poorly.
    Based on the needs of the country and the circumstances of various aspects, the Henan Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China assigned a savings absorption task of 55.8 billion yuan to the Nanyang Special District Central Branch. The Nanyang Special District Central Branch increased the figure to 70 billion yuan when assigning it to its subordinate county branches. The Nanyang County Branch accepted a task of 7 billion yuan, and then increased the figure to 8.19 billion yuan when assigning it to the various district bank offices. The tasks became increasingly large, and the distance from the actual situation became increasingly far. Some grassroots cadres, in order to complete this heavy and unbearable task, adopted various incorrect methods to force peasants to "save." It is only natural that they were opposed by the peasants.
    Why did the Henan Province banking system increase the savings absorption task numbers level by level like this? The motivations are different. Some unit leaders were afraid of not completing the task and being criticized by higher authorities, so they increased the task a bit when assigning it downwards to "leave room for maneuver." Some unit leaders, with impure motives, disregarded everything and increased the task in order to "overfulfill" it and curry favor with higher authorities. Although these people have different motivations, they only care about the numbers and not the policies; they only ask for tasks from their subordinates, but do not provide any concrete and practical assistance to their subordinates. As a result, either the task is not completed at all, or “the task is completed,” but it provokes opposition from the masses and causes significant political losses.
    Arbitrarily increasing tasks when assigning work to subordinates is a very bad style. The various tasks of the state are stipulated based on social needs, the consciousness and possibilities of the masses, and the experience of cadres. Arbitrarily increasing tasks means disregarding whether these conditions are possible, and it is inevitable to run into a wall. There is no doubt about this.
    Of course, this statement does not mean that local initiative can be obliterated or suppressed. Correctly leveraging local initiative has always been an important source for completing and overfulfilling state tasks. However, it has absolutely nothing in common with those practices of blindly increasing tasks for various impure motives.

    反对层层加大任务
    江夏
    去年年底，河南省银行系统办理“粮棉优待储蓄”业务。这是一种对农民非常有利的事情，许多银行工作人员却把它办坏了。
    中国人民银行河南省分行根据国家的需要和各方面的情况，分配给南阳专区中心支行的吸收储蓄任务是五百五十八亿元，南阳专区中心支行分配给所属各县支行的数字，就加大到七百亿元；南阳县支行接受的任务是七十亿元，分配给各区银行营业所的数字又加大到八十一亿九千万元。任务越来越大，和实际情况的距离越来越远。有些基层干部为了完成这沉重不堪的任务，就采取种种不正确方法，强迫农民“储蓄”。他们遭到农民的反对是很自然的。
    河南省银行系统为什么这样逐级加大吸收储蓄的任务数字呢？动机是有所不同的。有些单位的负责人员怕完不成任务，怕受上级批评，向下布置任务就加大一些，“留一机动余地”。有些单位的负责人员怀着不纯的动机，竟不顾一切，加大任务，以便“超额”完成，向上级邀功。尽管这些人的动机不同，但都是只问数字，不管政策；只向下级要任务，对下级却不做任何具体切实的帮助。其结果，或者根本完不成任务，或者
  “完成了任务”，但引起群众的反对，在政治上招致重大的损失。
    向下级布置工作时随意加大任务，是一种很坏的作风。国家的各种任务，是根据社会的需要、群众的觉悟和可能性、干部经验等条件规定的。随意加大任务，就是不顾这些条件是否可能，就必然要碰壁，这是毫无疑问的。
    当然，这种说法绝不意味着可以抹杀或压抑地方积极性。正确地发挥地方积极性，从来都是完成和超额完成国家任务的重要泉源。但它和那些为了各种不纯的动机而盲目加大任务的作法，决没有任何相同之点。
