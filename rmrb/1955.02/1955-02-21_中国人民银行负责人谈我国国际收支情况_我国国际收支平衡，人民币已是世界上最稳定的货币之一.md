Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: On the eve of the issuance of the new currency, a reporter from this agency interviewed the person in charge of the Head Office of the People's Bank of China, who discussed China's international balance of payments with the reporter.

He said that the increasing stability of China's Renminbi is not only reflected in the realization and consolidation of the balance of fiscal revenue and expenditure, the balance of material allocation, and the balance of cash revenue and expenditure, but also in the realization and consolidation of the balance of international payments, and the increasing value of the Renminbi externally. The Renminbi has become one of the most stable currencies in the world.

China's international balance of payments, along with the recovery and development of the entire national economy since the founding of the country, the expansion of international trade, and the development of international affairs, has achieved normal and stable development. The total amount of international receipts and payments, taking 1950 as 100, reached 221.5 by 1954.

The balance of China's international payments has been achieved and is being increasingly consolidated. After China began its planned economic construction in 1953, the need for foreign exchange expenditures increased, but due to the continuous increase in China's international income, the international balance of payments not only did not show a deficit, but was further consolidated. This presents a sharp contrast to the situation during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, when there were huge deficits every year. Comparing the revenue and expenditure of each year in China's international balance of payments, the expenditure accounted for 90 percent of the income from 1950 to 1952, and the expenditure accounted for 98.6 percent of the income in 1953 and 1954.

He then talked about China's gold reserves. He said that the Renminbi not only has sufficient material guarantees, but also has constantly increasing gold reserves. The gold reserves held by the state increased more than tenfold in 1954 compared to 1950.

The normal and stable development of China's international balance of payments is closely related to the rapid development of China's international trade. The proportion of international trade balance in China's international balance of payments was 70.8 percent in 1950, and increased to 83.9 percent in 1954. The proportion of state-owned foreign trade in China's international trade reached 97 percent in 1954, while it was only 61.1 percent in 1950. The proportion of trade with the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries is increasing day by day, accounting for 8.1 percent in 1950 and increasing to 73.4 percent in 1954. These are all favorable conditions for the normal and stable development of China's international balance of payments.

As a symbol of the Renminbi's foreign purchasing power, the foreign exchange price has undergone significant changes since the national price stabilization in March 1950. The exchange rate of the pound sterling has fallen from 98,900 yuan per pound to 68,930 yuan.

    中国人民银行负责人谈我国国际收支情况
    我国国际收支平衡，人民币已是世界上最稳定的货币之一
    【新华社二十日讯】在新币发行前夕，本社记者访问了中国人民银行总行负责人，他向记者谈述了我国国际收支的情况。
    他说，我国人民币的日益稳定，不仅表现于财政收支平衡、物资调拨平衡、现金收支平衡的实现和巩固，而且表现在国际收支平衡的实现和巩固，以及人民币对外价值的日益提高。人民币已成为世界上最稳定的货币之一。
    我国国际收支，随着建国以来整个国民经济的恢复和发展，国际贸易的扩大及国际事务的发展，已经获得了正常而稳定的发展。国际收支总额，如以一九五○年为一○○，到一九五四年已为二二一·五。
    我国的国际收支的平衡已经实现，而且正在日益巩固。一九五三年我国开始有计划的经济建设后，外汇支出的需要增多，但由于我国国际收入的不断增加，国际收支不仅未出现逆差，而且得到了进一步的巩固。这和国民党反动统治时期每年均有巨额逆差的情况，呈现尖锐的对比。我国国际收支，如以各年当年收支比较，则一九五○年到一九五二年支出占收入百分之九十，一九五三年及一九五四年支出占收入的百分之九十八点六。
    他接着谈到了我国的黄金储备。他说，人民币不仅拥有充分的物资保证，而且拥有不断增加的黄金储备。掌握在国家手中的黄金储备，一九五四年比一九五○年增加了十倍以上。
    我国国际收支的正常的稳定的发展，和我国国际贸易的迅速发展有密切的关系。我国国际收支中，国际贸易收支所占的比重，一九五○年为百分之七十点八，一九五四年已增至百分之八十三点九。我国国际贸易中国营对外贸易所占的比重，在一九五四年已达到百分之九十七，而一九五○年只有百分之六十一点一。对苏联和各人民民主国家的贸易的比重正在日益发展，一九五○年占百分之八点一，一九五四年已增至百分之七十三点四。这些都是我国国际收支能够正常而稳定地发展的有利条件。
    作为我国人民币对外购买力标志的外汇价格，自一九五○年三月全国物价稳定之后，已发生显著变化。英镑汇价已由每一英镑合人民币九八、九○○元下降到合六八、九三○元。
