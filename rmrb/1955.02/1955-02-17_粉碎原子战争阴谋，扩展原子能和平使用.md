    Among the various achievements of modern science and technology, it can be said that nothing is more important than the development and utilization of atomic energy. Also, there is nothing more important than the impact that scientific achievements in this area may have directly on the lives of people around the world. Everyone knows that in the era when the energy released by coal as fuel was transformed into mechanical power due to the invention of the steam engine, it had a tremendous revolutionary impact on industrial production and even on general science and technology.

    Today, we have already seen that the energy released by certain radioactive minerals, especially those containing uranium and thorium, as fissionable materials, is incomparably greater than the energy released by an equal weight of coal through combustion. Therefore, it is not difficult for us to foresee that the utilization of atomic energy will inevitably have a huge impact on future industrial production and the development of general science and technology, the extent of which is still difficult to fully estimate at present.

    Today, with this immense energy pouring out of the atomic world like a flood, only two paths lie before the people of the world: one is to head towards destructive war, which is a dark path; the other is to head towards light, providing a new material basis for rapidly improving the living standards of the vast majority of people.

    The dark path is to use the vast amount of energy possessed by fissionable materials and their various radioactive properties as weapons for mass slaughter and large-scale destruction, such as atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, radioactive poison gas, etc. This is the path chosen by American imperialism and followed by some other lackeys of American imperialism. Ever since American imperialism launched atomic bomb attacks on the peaceful residents of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, in August 1945, its sinful activities in the United Nations and in many other areas have been manifestations of its choice of this path.

    Why does it take this path? Of course, it has its own plans. Under the assumption of monopolizing the materials and technologies that can exert such a huge destructive force, a small group of monopoly capitalists fantasizes that this is a great opportunity to consolidate their ruling position; at the same time, it is also a crucial point that cannot be relaxed in order to extract maximum profits. If it can be done, using this kind of thing as their capital for deception, blackmail, and threats is entirely conducive to their conspiratorial methods and entirely in line with their greatest interests.

    Starting from this attempt, creating tension, clamoring for war, intensifying atomic terror, etc., are inevitable steps they will take; at the same time, under the pretext of military secrets, they will inevitably try to control as much as possible the radioactive mineral resources they can control and the scientific and technological knowledge of manufacturing fissionable materials, thereby attempting to prevent or delay as much as possible the use of atomic energy for peaceful industrial construction, in order to avoid the loss of their massive investments in old-fashioned industrial equipment. Conversely, if atomic energy is used entirely for war, they can seize maximum profits from the new type of military industry and temporarily and luckily prevent the arrival of economic depression.

    This is the wishful thinking of American imperialism. This calculation made in the dark will not work; because the development of atomic energy for human use has its own sun-like brilliance, illuminating its own future.

    The bright path is to develop the science and technology of the peaceful use of atomic energy, first of all, to widely disseminate relevant knowledge, including the use of atomic energy as a power source for various forms of peaceful industry, the significant effects of artificial radioactive elements in industrial manufacturing, medicine, and many scientific research works, and the necessary health care measures that staff should take to prevent the hazards of radiation, etc. At the same time, it is also necessary to correctly explain the impact of atomic weapons and thermonuclear weapons on buildings, organisms, long-term biological mutations, marine and terrestrial food, air deterioration, and meteorological conditions. Let the broad masses of the people thoroughly and correctly understand the degree of danger and the possible scope of these weapons, and not allow atomic warmongers to arbitrarily clamor and deliberately create terror.

    This is the unanimous wish of the people of the world, and it is also in line with the Soviet government's consistent advocacy of abolishing atomic weapons and other weapons of mass slaughter. In practice, the Soviet Union has provided a landmark achievement in using atomic energy to build power stations and is making continuous efforts to spread its accumulated valuable scientific knowledge and technology related to the peaceful use of atomic energy as much as possible to the scope it can reach. This selfless and noble expression is inspiring all peace-loving people in the world with irresistible force, mobilizing every conscientious scientist to support the great movement for the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    In the situation we face today, any rational person knows that we should not be satisfied with blind ignorance, nor should we spread unnecessary fear. It must be pointed out that all weapons of mass destruction have a common characteristic: that is, their indiscriminate and blind destructiveness. Therefore, in today's world, where everyone possesses this kind of thing, the main problem we face is not whose bomb is the biggest, the most barbaric, or the smallest, the most suitable; but who dares to do it? There is no doubt that the consequences of using atomic weapons will be most detrimental to countries with concentrated industries and populations, and the most afflicted will be the vast people of the world. Our country, with its relatively backward industry and the vast majority of its population scattered over a large area, does not have sufficient conditions for the former today.

    However, in order to safeguard the interests of the people of the world, in order to save the indivisible destiny of all mankind, we must quickly rise up and unite with all peace-loving and justice-upholding people in the world to stop the clamor of madmen and criminals obsessed with atomic fanaticism. We must make them sober up and kneel down in the face of the irresistible force of the broad masses of the people, and honestly take out and completely destroy those things that threaten the people.

    On January 19th of this year, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council issued an appeal to the people of the world, refuting the slander that atomic war is inevitable, condemning any government that attempts to launch an atomic war; it called on us to rise up against the planners of atomic war, it advocated destroying all stored atomic weapons and immediately stopping the manufacture of atomic weapons. All of this is in line with the current and future interests of the people of the world, and only in this way can we create the necessary conditions for the peaceful use of atomic energy. We support this just call with infinite enthusiasm and are determined to support it with active actions. Let everyone quickly rise up and sign!

    粉碎原子战争阴谋，扩展原子能和平使用
    中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会主席　李四光
    近代科学技术的种种成就中，可以说再没有什么比原子能的开发和利用更重要了。科学的成果直接对全世界人民的生活所可能发生的影响，也再没有什么比在这一方面的发明和发现更重要了。大家知道，在煤炭作为燃料发出来的能量由于蒸汽机的发明而得以把它改变为机械动力的时代，它在工业生产方面乃至一般科学技术方面曾经发生过如何巨大的革命性的影响。
    今天，我们已经看见某些带放射性的矿产，特别是其中含铀和钍的矿物，作为可分裂物质所能发出的能量，对重量相等的煤炭经过燃烧所能发出能量来说，那是大到无可比拟的。因此，我们不难预见原子能的利用在今后的工业生产上，和一般科学技术的发展上，将要不可避免地发生现时还难以充分估计的巨大影响。
    在这种庞大无比的能量，从原子世界洪流一般地冲击出来的今天，摆在全世界人民面前的只有两条路可走：一条是走向毁灭性的战争，这是黑暗的道路；另一条是走向光明，为迅速地提高广大人民的生活水平提供新的物质基础。
    黑暗的道路，就是把可分裂物质所具有的大量能量和它的各种放射性用来作大量屠杀和大规模破坏的武器，例如原子弹、氢弹、放射毒雾等等。这是美帝国主义所选择的道路，也是其他若干美帝国主义仆从者所遵循的道路。美帝国主义自从一九四五年八月对日本广岛和长崎和平居民发动了原子弹袭击以来，它在联合国和其他多方面的罪恶活动，都是它选择了这一条道路的表现。
    它为什么要走这条道路？这当然有它的打算，在垄断了能够发挥这种巨大破坏力的物质和技术的假定下，一小撮垄断资本家就异想天开，认为这是巩固他们的统治地位的大好机会；同时也是为了榨取最大利润所不容放松的关键。假如能够办到的话，拿这种东西来做他们欺骗、讹诈、威胁的资本，那是完全有利于他们的阴谋手段，也是完全符合于他们最大利益的。
    从这种企图出发，制造紧张局势、叫嚣战争、加剧原子恐怖等等，是他们必然采取的步骤；同时也必然以军事秘密的借口，尽量控制他们能够控制的放射性矿产资源和制造分裂物质的科学技术，从而企图杜绝或者尽量推迟原子能使用到和平工业建设方面，以避免他们在旧式工业装备中大量投资的损失。反过来说，如果原子能完全供战争使用的话，他们又可以从新型的军事工业中夺取最大利润，并且借以暂时侥幸地阻拦经济萧条的来临。
    这是美帝国主义的如意算盘。这种在黑暗中打好的算盘是行不通的；因为原子能供人类使用的发展有它自己太阳似的光辉，照耀着它自己的前途。
    光明的道路就是发展和平利用原子能的科学技术，首先是广泛地传播有关的知识，包括原子能作为各种形式的和平工业所需要的动力来源的使用，人工放射性元素在工业制造方面、医药方面以及许多科学研究工作方面的重大效用，和工作人员对防范放射的危害性所应有的保健措施等等。同时也必须正确地说明原子武器和热核子武器对建筑物、生物、生物长期发生的变态、海产和陆上食物、空气恶化以及气象条件的影响。让广大的人民群众彻底地、正确地了解这种武器的危险性的程度和可能波及的范围，不让原子战争贩子们任意叫嚷，故意制造恐怖。
    这是全世界人民一致的愿望，这也正符合于苏联政府废止原子武器和其他大规模屠杀武器的一贯主张。从实践方面来说，苏联已经提供了利用原子能建立发电站的划时代的成就，并且正在作不断的努力，把它所积累的有关和平使用原子能的宝贵科学知识和技术，尽量传播到它所能够达到的范围。这种大公无私的崇高表现，正在以不可抗拒的力量鼓舞着全世界一切爱好和平的人民，动员每一个有良心的科学家来支持和平使用原子能的伟大运动。
    在今天我们所面临的局势下，任何一个有理智的人都知道，我们不应该满足于盲目的无知，也不应该传播不必要的恐惧。必须指出，所有一切大规模毁灭的武器都具有一个共同的特征：那就是它们的毫无选择的盲目破坏性。所以在谁都掌握了这种东西的今天，我们面临的主要问题，不在于谁的炸弹最大、最野蛮，或者最小、最合用；而在于谁敢动手？毫无疑问，使用原子武器的后果最吃亏的是工业和人口集中的国家，最遭殃的是全世界广大的人民。而我们这个工业比较落后，绝大部分的人口分散在一个广大面积的国家，对前一点来说，今天并没有具备足够的条件。
    但是为了维护全世界人民的利益，为了拯救全人类不可分割的命运，我们必须赶快起来，和全世界爱好和平、主持正义的人民团结一致，制止犯了原子狂热的疯子们和犯罪者的叫嚣，必须让他们在广大人民不可抗拒的力量面前清醒过来，屈膝下去，老老实实地把那些威胁人民的东西拿出来全部销毁。
    本年一月十九日世界和平理事会常务委员会发布了告全世界人民书，驳斥了原子战争不可避免的谰言，谴责了任何企图发动原子战争的政府；它号召我们起来反对原子战争的策划者，它主张毁掉储存的全部原子武器，并且立即停止制造原子武器。这一切都是符合于全世界人民当前和未来的利益的，也只有这样，才能为和平使用原子能创造必要的条件。我们对这一正义的号召是以无限的热忱来拥护的，是一定要以积极的行动来支持的。让大家赶快起来签名吧。
