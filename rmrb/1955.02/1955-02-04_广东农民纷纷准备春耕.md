Guangdong farmers in various regions are actively preparing for spring plowing. In many areas, farmers are investing the money from selling surplus grain into production. For example, farmers in Haikang County bought 4.5 billion yuan worth of means of production from supply and marketing cooperatives. Driven by agricultural production cooperatives, many areas have launched a manure accumulation campaign. In the East Guangdong area, more than ten districts have accumulated over 8.5 million dan of soil fertilizer. Currently, farmers in East Guangdong, North Guangdong, and West Guangdong are working intensively on winter repairs of farmland water conservancy projects. Farmers in Gaoyao County have also raised 8 billion yuan themselves to build small-scale farmland water conservancy projects. In order to eradicate pests, various places are digging up rice roots, irrigating to submerge the winter fields, and carrying out other pest control work. Currently, the area of rice roots dug up in Chao'an and Jieyang counties accounts for 80 percent. (Report from Guangdong reporter station of this newspaper)
