In order to meet the needs of national planned economic construction and the wishes of the broad masses of people, to further improve and consolidate our country's monetary system on the basis of balanced fiscal revenue and expenditure and stable financial prices, and to facilitate transactions and accounting, it is now decided:

I. The People's Bank of China is instructed to issue new Renminbi (hereinafter referred to as "new currency") from March 1, 1955, to withdraw the existing Renminbi (hereinafter referred to as "old currency"). The denominations of the new currency are: the main currency includes five denominations: one yuan, two yuan, three yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan; the subsidiary currency includes six denominations: one fen, two fen, five fen, one jiao, two jiao, and five jiao. Each denomination is printed with four languages: Chinese, Tibetan, Mongolian, and Uyghur.

II. The conversion ratio between the new and old currencies is set at one yuan of the new currency being equal to ten thousand yuan of the old currency. From the date of issuance of the new currency, all monetary receipts and payments, transaction pricing, contracts, agreements, receipts, vouchers, accounting records, and international settlements of all institutions, organizations, enterprises, and individuals shall be calculated in new currency; all creditor's rights and debts existing before the issuance of the new currency, including national bonds, shall also be calculated and settled in new currency at the statutory ratio from the same date.

III. All old currency shall be fully withdrawn by the People's Bank of China at the statutory ratio. All holders of old currency may go to the People's Bank of China or its authorized exchange institutions to exchange for new currency at the statutory ratio from the date of issuance of the new currency. During the exchange period, the old currency may still be converted into new currency at the statutory ratio and circulate simultaneously with the new currency. The two old currency denominations of ten thousand yuan and fifty thousand yuan will cease to circulate on the market on April 1, 1955, but can still be exchanged for new currency at the statutory ratio at the People's Bank of China or its authorized exchange institutions before April 30th. From May 1, 1955, the People's Bank of China will stop accepting exchanges. The time when the various old currency denominations of five thousand yuan and below will cease to circulate will be determined separately and appropriately by the People's Bank of China depending on the exchange situation.

IV. Anyone who forges or uses counterfeit money shall be punished in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Crimes Against National Currency. Anyone who takes advantage of the issuance of new currency to engage in speculation or profit from the exchange of new and old currency shall be severely punished according to law. All people in the country may report the above illegal acts to the local People's Committee.

Premier Zhou Enlai, February 21, 1955

    中华人民共和国国务院
    关于发行新的人民币和收回现行的人民币的命令
    为适应国家计划经济建设的需要和广大人民的愿望，在财政收支平衡和金融物价稳定的基础上，进一步健全和巩固我国的货币制度，以便利交易和核算，现决定：
    一、责成中国人民银行自一九五五年三月一日起发行新的人民币（以下简称新币），以收回现行的人民币（以下简称旧币）。新币面额，主币分为一元、二元、三元、五元、十元五种，辅币分为一分、二分、五分、一角、二角、五角六种。每种券别版面均印有汉、藏、蒙、维吾尔四种文字。
    二、新旧币的折合比率，定为新币一元等于旧币一万元。自新币发行之日起，凡机关、团体、企业和个人的一切货币收付、交易计价、契约、合同、单据、凭证、帐簿记载及国际间的清算等，均以新币为计算单位；所有在新币发行前的一切债权债务，包括国家公债在内，亦自同一日起，按法定比率折合新币计算和清偿。
    三、所有旧币均由中国人民银行按法定比率全部收回。凡持有旧币者，自新币发行之日起，均可到中国人民银行或其代理兑换机构，按法定比率兑换新币。在兑换期间，旧币仍得按法定比率折合新币与新币同时流通。票面一万元、五万元的两种旧币截至一九五五年四月一日停止在市场上流通使用，但在四月三十日前仍可到中国人民银行或其代理兑换机构，按法定比率兑换新币，从一九五五年五月一日起中国人民银行停止收兑。票面五千元及五千元以下各种旧币停止流通使用的时间，由中国人民银行视收兑情形另行适当规定。
    四、凡伪造或行使假钞者，依照妨害国家货币治罪暂行条例治罪。凡借发行新币进行投机或经营兑换新旧币从中渔利者，依法严惩。全国人民都可向当地人民委员会检举以上各项违法行为。总理周恩来一九五五年二月二十一日
