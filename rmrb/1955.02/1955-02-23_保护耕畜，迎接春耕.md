    Protect Draught Animals, Prepare for Spring Plowing
    Long Zhi
    Since last winter, a serious phenomenon of farmers selling off draught animals in large numbers, a sharp drop in livestock prices, and indiscriminate slaughter of draught animals has occurred in many areas. A considerable portion of the slaughtered livestock were animals capable of plowing, as well as female animals and young livestock. Although farmers usually sell and slaughter some old and sick draught animals every winter, the quantity was not as large as it was last winter. This phenomenon has not completely stopped even now, and it should attract our highest attention.
    The main reasons for this situation are: some farmers still have certain misunderstandings about agricultural cooperativization and the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, some deviations have occurred in the implementation of policies in some places, restrictions on livestock transportation in some places are too strict, and disaster areas are seriously lacking in fodder.
    The phenomenon of selling off and indiscriminately slaughtering draught animals in large numbers is a serious threat to our country's agricultural production. Because for a considerable period to come, draught animals will still be the main power for our country's agricultural production. The large-scale loss of draught animals cannot be recovered in just one or two years. Therefore, all localities should list the work of protecting livestock as one of the current important tasks, conscientiously implement the policy of protecting draught animals, and immediately adopt effective measures to lead the broad masses of farmers in doing a good job in loving and protecting livestock.
    We must continue to carry out socialist education in depth among farmers, so that they can correctly understand agricultural cooperativization and the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain, eliminate their various misunderstandings and concerns, and encourage them to raise livestock and develop production. At present, some farmers believe that joining agricultural production cooperatives is a general trend, and they will join sooner or later. Now, selling livestock can both get cash and save a lot of trouble, and they don't have to worry about not having livestock to use after joining the cooperative, so they sell the livestock. These people only care about their personal immediate interests and ignore the overall long-term interests, which is certainly wrong. If everyone sells their draught animals, what will the cooperative use for agricultural production? Wouldn't the result be that they themselves suffer? In addition, ideological education on the importance of draught animals should be strengthened for district and village cadres and farmers, overcoming the unrealistic ideas of waiting for the use of tractors and underestimating the role of draught animals in agricultural production. In the next few years, our country will not be able to manufacture a large number of tractors, and the realization of agricultural mechanization is a matter of a considerable period of time in the future; even if agricultural mechanization is realized in the future, livestock will still have its important uses. The Soviet Union was still opposed to the tendency to underestimate the role of horse traction when socialist industry was able to produce tractors and agricultural machinery in large quantities. What reason do we have now to underestimate the role of draught animals? Today, our country's draught animals are still generally lacking. In many areas, draught animals bear too much land area, and they can no longer cultivate deeply and meticulously. With the rapid development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the popularization of double-wheeled double-铧犁 and other new types of animal-powered farm implements, the countryside not only requires more draught animals, but also requires stronger and more powerful draught animals. We should strive to protect the existing draught animals and do our best to breed draught animals; it is certainly wrong to slaughter draught animals in large quantities.
    In the agricultural cooperativization movement, the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit must be conscientiously implemented and properly handled with regard to the issue of draught animals joining the cooperatives. The issue of draught animals joining the cooperative is directly related to the interests of households with livestock and the unity of middle and poor peasants. To deal with this issue, we must correctly implement the class policy of relying on poor peasants and consolidating the unity of middle peasants, proceeding from the existing economic conditions in the cooperative and the level of consciousness of the members, and not be too hasty or put forward excessive slogans. Generally, new cooperatives do not need to implement the method of valuing draught animals and turning them over to the public too early, but should appropriately adopt the method of private ownership by members and renting by the cooperative, according to the actual situation. The scoring, work points, or rent should be fair and reasonable, so that neither the cooperative nor the livestock-raising households suffer. Cooperatives that implement the method of valuing draught animals and turning them over to the public should strive for a fair and reasonable valuation of livestock through democratic discussion. If the market price of livestock fluctuates too much at that time, the price of livestock joining the cooperative can be appropriately increased with reference to the seasonal price difference between the slack and busy farming seasons. The repayment period for the livestock price discount should be determined according to the specific repayment capacity of each cooperative, and should generally not be too long; if the period is too long, with the consent of the members' meeting, interest can be paid according to the deposit interest rate of the local credit cooperative or the state bank. After draught animals join the cooperative, a feeding management and service system should be established and improved, feeding management should be strengthened, and efforts should be made to eliminate the phenomenon of feeding them too thinly or to death, so as to drive the broad masses of farmers to love and protect livestock. The agricultural production cooperative in Xiangyang County, Hubei Province, has stipulated some better methods: determining the cultivation standard according to the physical strength of the cattle and the difficulty of cultivation; rationally adjusting the work points for feeding cattle to encourage the enthusiasm of the cow-feeding members; members of the cooperative affairs committee should appoint a special person to lead and inspect the feeding and management of the cattle in the cooperative, and stipulate an inspection and evaluation system. These methods can be implemented for reference in various places. Cooperatives should properly handle the weak and small livestock of the members; many cooperatives require that small livestock be exchanged for large livestock, and some restrict the entry of female, young, old, and weak draught animals into the cooperative, which is also one of the reasons for the large inflow of draught animals into the market and their slaughter. In fact, the work that cooperatives need livestock to do is not necessarily all heavy work or tiring work, so strong and healthy large livestock can do heavy work, and old and weak livestock can do light and convenient odd jobs (such as grinding flour for members, using vehicles to visit relatives, etc.); in places with more land, wasteland and grassland can also be used to develop animal husbandry, raise more female livestock, and breed young livestock. In short, as long as a careful plan can be made according to the agriculture and sideline industries in the cooperative, and the issue of the entry of weak and small livestock into the cooperative can be properly handled, it will be beneficial to both the livestock-raising households and the entire cooperative.
    It is a serious task at present to effectively help farmers solve the difficulty of fodder and strive to save draught animals in disaster areas. We must continue to implement the policy of self-reliance through production, actively organize the masses to carry out sideline production, support livestock with livestock, and overcome the final difficulties. Grain and supply and marketing cooperative departments should promptly do a good job in supplying miscellaneous grains, potatoes, and bran, cakes, distiller's grains, etc., according to the actual situation in various places. In general areas, farmers should be mobilized to actively find available fodder substitutes, such as corn stalks, bean stalks, buckwheat stalks, potato vines, etc., which can be processed into feed, and the practice of feeding coarse feed with fine feed should be promoted; in areas with conditions, some coal can be supplied to replace burning grass, saving fodder for livestock.
    Strengthening market management and strictly implementing the inspection system for slaughtering draught animals are also important for protecting draught animals. Those who fabricate rumors to sabotage, steal and slaughter draught animals, depress prices to purchase, or engage in speculation and profiteering should be punished according to law depending on the seriousness of the circumstances. Supply and marketing cooperatives should actively strengthen the leadership of the draught animal market, encourage and organize livestock dealers to conduct legitimate business, and do a good job in the exchange and adjustment of livestock in a planned way. Spring epidemics are very harmful to draught animals. It is necessary to mobilize the masses to carry out the prevention of infectious diseases of draught animals, promptly grasp the epidemic situation, and actively carry out prevention and control. Epidemics are more likely to occur in disaster areas, and prevention should be paid attention to as early as possible.

    保护耕畜，迎接春耕
    隆芝
    从去年冬季以来，在不少地区发生了农民大量出卖耕畜、畜价暴跌和滥宰耕畜的严重现象。被屠宰的牲畜中有相当大的一部分为有耕作能力的牲畜，还有母畜和幼畜。虽然，每到冬季，农民总要出卖和宰杀一些病老的耕畜，但数量没有去年冬季那样多。这种现象到现在还没有完全停止，应该引起我们最高度的注意。
    产生这种情况的主要原因是：部分农民对于农业合作化及粮食统购统销政策尚有某些误解，部分地方在政策执行中发生了某些偏差，有些地方对牲畜贩运限制过严，灾区严重缺乏饲料。
    大量出卖和滥宰耕畜的现象，是对于我国农业生产的严重威胁。因为在今后相当长的时期内，耕畜还是我国农业生产的主要动力，耕畜的大量损失，绝不是一两年所能恢复的。因此，各地都应把保畜工作列为当前重要工作之一，认真贯彻保护耕畜政策，立即采取有效办法，领导广大农民做好爱畜保畜工作。
    我们要继续深入地对农民进行社会主义教育，使他们正确认识农业合作化和粮食统购统销政策，消除他们的各种误解和顾虑，鼓励他们饲养牲畜发展生产。目前有的农民认为参加农业生产合作社已是大势所趋，早晚都要入社，现在卖出牲口，既能得到现钱，又很省心，入社后还不愁没有牲口用，就把牲口卖了。这些人只顾个人眼前利益，忽略了整体的长远利益，这当然是错误的。试问大家都把耕畜卖了，合作社用什么来进行农业生产呢？结果还不是自己吃亏么？此外，对区、村干部和农民还要加强重视耕畜的思想教育，克服等待使用拖拉机、轻视耕畜在农业生产中的作用的不切实际的想法。在最近几年，我国还不能制造大量的拖拉机，实现农业机械化是相当长时期以后的事；即使将来实现了农业机械化，牲畜还是有它的重要用途的。苏联在社会主义工业已能大批生产拖拉机和农业机器的时候，还在反对过低估计马匹曳引力的作用的偏向，我们现在有什么理由轻视耕畜的作用呢？今天，我国耕畜还普遍缺乏，很多地区耕畜负担地亩面积过大，已经不能深耕细作；随着互助合作运动的迅速发展，双轮双铧犁及其他新式畜力农具的推广，农村中不但要求更多的耕畜，而且要求更健壮有力的耕畜。我们应该努力保护现有的耕畜，并且尽力繁殖耕畜；大量宰杀耕畜当然是不对的。
    在农业合作化运动中，对于耕畜入社问题，必须认真贯彻自愿互利的原则，妥善地加以处理。耕畜入社问题直接关系着有牲畜户的利益，关系着中农和贫农的团结。处理这个问题，必须正确贯彻依靠贫农和巩固地团结中农的阶级政策，从社内现有经济条件和社员的觉悟水平出发，不宜操之过急，提出过高口号。一般新办的社，不必过早地实行耕畜折价归公的办法，而应根据实际情况，适当地采取社员私有、由社租用的方式。评分、记工或租费应公平合理，使合作社和养畜户都不吃亏。实行耕畜折价归公的社，应通过民主评议，力争牲畜作价公平合理，如当时市场畜价波动太大，可以参照农闲农忙的季节差价，适当提高入社牲畜的价格。畜价折款的偿还期限，应按各个合作社的具体偿付能力而定，一般不宜太长；期限过长的，经社员大会同意，可按当地信用社或国家银行的存款利率付息。耕畜入社后，要建立和健全饲养管理和使役制度，加强饲养管理，努力消除喂瘦喂死的现象，以带动广大农民爱畜保畜。湖北省襄阳县农业生产合作社规定了一些较好的办法：按耕牛体力和耕作难易，确定耕作标准；合理调整喂牛工分，鼓励喂牛社员的饲养积极性；社务委员推定专人领导和检查社内耕牛的饲养管理情况，并规定检查评比制度。这些办法，各地可参考实行。合作社对于社员的弱小的牲畜应该加以适当的处理；很多合作社都要求把小牲口换成大牲口，有的并限制母、幼、老、弱的耕畜入社，也是促使耕畜大量流入市场和被宰杀的原因之一。其实，合作社需要牲口干的活不一定都是重活，累活，所以健壮的大牲口可作重活，老弱牲畜可作轻便的零活（譬如为社员磨面，套车走亲戚等）；在土地较广的地方，还可利用荒坡草地发展畜牧业，多养母畜，繁殖仔畜。总之，只要能按照社内的农业、副业作周密计划，妥善处理弱小牲畜入社的问题，对于养畜户和全社都是有利的。
    切实帮助农民解决饲料困难，努力拯救灾区耕畜，这是目前一项严重任务。要继续贯彻生产自救的方针，积极组织群众开展副业生产，以畜养畜，渡过最后难关。粮食和供销合作部门应根据各地实际情况，及时做好杂粮、薯类和糠麸、饼类、糟?等饲料的供应工作。一般地区要动员农民积极寻找可资利用的饲料代用品，如玉米秸、豆秸、荞麦秆、薯蔓等，可加工制成饲料，提倡粗料精喂；在有条件地区，可供应部分煤炭代替烧草，节约饲草喂牲畜。
    加强市场管理，严格执行屠宰耕畜的检验制度，对保护耕畜也很重要。对凡造谣破坏，偷宰耕畜，压价套购，投机捣把者，应视情节轻重依法惩处。供销合作社应积极加强领导耕畜市场，鼓励并组织畜贩进行正当经营，有计划地做好牲畜交流和调剂工作。春季疫病对耕畜为害很大，要发动群众开展耕畜传染病的预防工作，及时掌握疫情，主动进行防治。灾区更易发生疫病，尤应及早注意防范。
