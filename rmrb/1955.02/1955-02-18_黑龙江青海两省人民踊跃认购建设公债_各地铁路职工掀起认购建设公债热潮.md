Railway Workers Across the Country Launch Upsurge in Subscription to National Construction Bonds

[This newspaper dispatch] (Beijing) The people of more than sixty cities and counties in Heilongjiang Province, including Harbin, Jiamusi, Anda, and Baiquan, have begun to enthusiastically subscribe to the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds. Harbin City, which started subscribing earlier, has already subscribed 14 billion yuan. Workers in the tool workshop of the Harbin Ball Bearing Factory subscribed more than 10 million yuan in twenty minutes. Employees of various department stores in Harbin City subscribed 290 million yuan in one day. Farmers in the suburbs of the city have already subscribed 1.26 billion yuan, exceeding the planned target by 5 percent. Many farmers in Songpu District said: "When the Songhua River flooded two years ago, the government built dams for us; when we didn't have enough production funds, the government gave us loans. Now that we have more money, we should buy more bonds to support national economic construction." In Anda, Boli, and Baiquan counties, only 2,253 government cadres subscribed to 200.3 million yuan in bonds. Staff members of the Gorlos Rear Banner People's Government exceeded their planned subscription target by 100% in two hours.

(Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 15th) Workers and staff of factories, troops, and provincial-level government agencies and organizations in Qinghai Province are subscribing to the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds. At present, the Qinghai People's Wool Textile Factory, the Qinghai Provincial Ethnic Affairs Commission, the Department of Civil Affairs, the Department of Finance, the Qinghai Provincial Postal and Telecommunications Administration, and the Qinghai Daily, among other units, have exceeded their expected sales quotas. Employees of many units completed their subscriptions in one or two hours, and those with savings usually paid the bond amount in full at once.

Railway workers across the country are enthusiastically subscribing to the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds. The directly affiliated organs of the Ministry of Railways have completed their subscriptions, reaching over 1.79 billion yuan. Employees of the Labor and Wage Bureau completed all subscriptions in one day. Huang Lianghao, an employee of the Commercial Bureau, held a family meeting to discuss ways to reduce unnecessary expenses in the future and decided to use several years of savings to subscribe to the bonds. By January 29, more than 6,000 employees from 26 units in the Tianjin railway sector had subscribed to nearly 1 billion yuan. After listening to the report on the issuance of bonds, Liu Zhentang, an old worker from the Tianjin Engineering Section, used his surplus and potentially saved money to buy 700,000 yuan in bonds. He said: "Buying bonds will make socialism come faster and will strongly support the liberation of Taiwan." After listening to the report on subscribing to bonds, employees of the directly affiliated organs of the Harbin Railway Bureau immediately launched an upsurge in bond subscriptions, completing all subscriptions in twenty or thirty minutes. Zhang Jiping and five others from the Education Department of the Bureau, who were on a business trip in Shenyang, immediately called the office to subscribe upon hearing about the issuance of bonds. Many employees of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau and the Xi'an Train Section have also subscribed to the bonds.
