Xinhua News Agency, February 21st: According to TASS reports: The Soviet government's statement regarding the upcoming meeting of the United Nations Disarmament Commission subcommittee has received widespread attention from Western European countries and American newspapers.

French newspapers widely published reports about the Soviet government's statement. "L'Humanité" headlined: "Destroy All Existing Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs," "Maintain Armed Forces and Military Expenditures at Current Levels," "Convene a World Conference to Reduce Armaments and Ban Atomic Weapons."

French democratic newspapers contrasted the proposals put forward in the Soviet government statement with the British government's announcement of its intention to manufacture hydrogen weapons. "Libération" pointed out that the British government's intention harbored the danger of drastically increasing international tensions and the threat of world war. The newspaper said: "The only way to guarantee security is through disarmament, through the prohibition of atomic weapons, through the destruction of all existing thermonuclear bombs and shells, the prohibition of the manufacture of these weapons, and the establishment of a supervisory system." The newspaper said: "If France takes the lead in this disarmament movement and responds to the Soviet initiative with its own initiative, then France will become a truly great power."

"Le Monde" published an editorial saying that the Soviet government's proposal to maintain armed forces and armaments at the level of January 1, 1955, was a "new factor." When talking about the Soviet proposal to destroy existing atomic and hydrogen weapons, "Le Monde" admitted that this was what the whole world longed for. However, the newspaper raised various conditions regarding the initial establishment of supervision.

"France-Soir" acknowledged that the main point of the Soviet statement "conforms to the wishes of the people of the whole world," especially now that Western countries are preparing to ratify the Paris Agreements.

"L'Aurore" and "La Croix," etc., tried their best to convince readers that the Soviet government's proposal was a propaganda proposal.

Italian newspapers were very interested in the Soviet government's statement. "L'Unità" believed that the Soviet proposal was "a new and important step towards easing tensions" and that these proposals fully conformed to the just demands of the world public to destroy existing nuclear weapons. "Il Tempo" believed that "the Soviet proposal is a concrete initiative to defend peace."

Bourgeois newspapers also published a considerable number of comments on this statement. The semi-official "Corriere della Sera," in order to reduce the great impact of the Soviet proposals, tried in vain to describe these proposals as "propaganda gimmicks." Rome's "Il Tempo" worriedly said that the Soviet proposals "are tempting."

Dutch newspapers published news of the Soviet government's statement. Dutch radio also broadcast a detailed summary of the Soviet government's statement.

The Soviet government's statement received the attention of the American public. Commentators in some American newspapers, taking this attention into consideration, attempted to insinuate to Americans that the Soviet proposals did not seem to be intended to stop the atomic weapons race. For this purpose, they used the old trick of confusing the public, insisting that the Soviet proposals were "propaganda steps." The "New York Times" revealed the real purpose of doing this, saying in an article that the Soviet proposals would cause the United States to lose one of the main tools of its notorious "position of strength" policy - the intimidation of atomic weapons. The newspaper also pointed out that accepting the Soviet proposals would make "the arming of West Germany impossible."

According to Agence France-Presse, diplomats in Washington, London, and Paris noted the part of the Soviet government statement that the Paris Agreements were incompatible with the Western governments' statements about their readiness to negotiate on the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

### 苏联政府声明符合世界人民愿望  西欧和美国报纸重视苏联就裁军委员会工作提出的建议

    苏联政府声明符合世界人民愿望
    西欧和美国报纸重视苏联就裁军委员会工作提出的建议
   【新华社二十一日讯】据塔斯社消息：苏联政府关于即将举行的联合国裁军委员会小组委员会会议的声明，受到西欧国家和美国报纸的普遍重视。
    法国报纸广泛刊载了关于苏联政府声明的报道。“人道报”的标题是：“销毁现存的一切原子弹和氢弹”，“武装力量和军事费用保持在目前的水平上”，“召开世界会议以裁减军备和禁止原子武器”。
    法国民主报纸把苏联政府声明中提出的建议同英国政府发表的宣布英国打算制造氢武器的声明作了对比。“解放报”指出，英国政府的意图里隐藏着剧烈增加国际紧张局势的危险和世界大战的威胁。这家报纸说：“保证安全的唯一办法是通过裁军，通过禁止原子武器，通过销毁一切现存的热核子炸弹和炮弹，禁止制造这些武器，并建立监督制度。”这家报纸说：“如果法国在这个裁军运动中起带头作用，并以它自己的倡议来答复苏联的倡议，那末法国将成为一个真正的大国。”
    “世界报”发表社论说，苏联政府提出的使武装部队和军备保持在一九五五年一月一日的水平上的建议是一个“新因素”。“世界报”谈到苏联关于销毁现存的原子武器和氢武器的建议时承认，这是全世界所渴望的。但是报纸就初步建立监督的问题提出了各种条件。
      “法兰西晚报”承认，苏联的声明的主旨是
  “符合全世界人民的心意”的，特别是在现在西方国家正在准备批准巴黎协定的时候。
      “义勇军报”和“震旦报”等则竭力企图使读者相信，苏联政府的建议是一个宣传性的建议。
    意大利报纸对苏联政府声明很感兴趣。“团结报”认为苏联建议是“走向缓和紧张局势的一个新的重要步骤”，并认为这些建议完全符合于世界公众提出的销毁现存的核子武器的正义要求。“国家报”认为，“苏联的建议是一个保卫和平的具体倡议”。
    资产阶级报纸也对这个声明发表了相当多的评论。半官方的“报信者报”为了要减少苏联的建议的巨大影响，徒劳无功地设法把这些建议说成是
  “宣传伎俩”。罗马的“时代报”担心地说，苏联的建议“是诱人的”。
    荷兰报纸登载了苏联政府声明的消息。荷兰广播电台也广播了苏联政府声明的详细摘要。
    苏联政府的声明受到美国公众的注意。美国某些报纸的评论员考虑到这种注意，企图向美国人暗示：苏联的建议似乎并无意于停止原子武器的竞赛。他们为了这种目的，使用了老一套的迷惑视听的手段，硬说苏联的建议是“宣传的步骤”。“纽约时报”透露了这样做的真正目的，在它所刊载的一篇消息中实际上就是说：苏联的建议将使得美国失去它的臭名昭彰的“实力地位”政策的主要工具之一——原子武器的恫吓。报纸还指出，接受苏联建议将使得“武装西德不可能实现”。
    据法新社报道，华盛顿、伦敦和巴黎的外交人士注意到苏联政府声明中的这一部分：巴黎协定是和西方国家政府关于它们准备就裁减军备和禁止原子武器进行谈判的声明不能相容的。
