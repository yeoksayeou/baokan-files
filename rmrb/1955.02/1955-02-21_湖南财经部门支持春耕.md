Hunan Financial Departments Support Spring Plowing

    The intensive spring plowing and production is about to begin, and the financial departments in Hunan Province are taking active measures to support this central task.

    Local grain departments are investigating grain supply conditions to effectively solve the food supply problem for grain-deficient households. From February 2nd to 4th, the Hunan Provincial Grain Bureau also held a special symposium on grain supply in disaster areas, deciding to actively improve grain supply operations and support spring plowing in disaster areas. At the same time, the grain department transferred 55.82 million jin of various coarse grain seeds from Sichuan, Hubei, Zhejiang and other provinces, and transferred tens of millions of jin of early rice and late rice seeds from within the province to the lake area to meet the needs of farmers' planting. In order to help farmers solve the difficulties in production investment, the People's Bank of Hunan Province has allocated more than 600 billion yuan of agricultural loans allocated by the head office to the counties; Xiangtan County had already issued 230 million yuan of the first batch of agricultural loans for this year to farmers by the end of January, and many farmers have used the loans to buy farm tools, fertilizers, and draft cattle.

    The production materials that supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the province are preparing to supply to farmers this year have generally increased significantly. As of February 5th, the supply and marketing cooperatives across the province had prepared approximately 1.58 million pieces of old-style farm tools. The oilseed fertilizer and chemical fertilizer organized by the Hunan Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative already amount to 700,000 dan. The supply and marketing cooperatives in various regions are preparing to supply more than 10,000 heads of draft cattle this year. (Zhang Xianyou)

    湖南财经部门支持春耕
    紧张的春耕生产就要到来，湖南省各财经部门采取积极措施，支持这项中心工作。
    各地粮食部门正在调查粮食供应情况，切实解决缺粮户的口粮供应问题。二月二日到四日，湖南省粮食厅还专门召开了灾区粮食供应座谈会，决定积极改进粮食供应业务，支援灾区的春耕生产。同时，粮食部门从四川、湖北、浙江等省调运到各种杂粮种籽五千五百八十二万斤，从省内调拨了几千万斤早稻、晚稻种籽运到滨湖地区，供应农民播种的需要。为了帮助农民解决生产投资中的困难，湖南省人民银行已经把总行拨给的六千多亿元农业贷款分配到县；湘潭县在一月底以前就把今年的第一批农业贷款二亿三千万元发放给农民，许多农民已经用贷款买了农具、肥料和耕牛。
    全省各地供销合作社今年准备供应给农民的生产资料一般都增加不少。到二月五日，全省供销合作社准备的旧式农具约有一百五十八万件。湖南省供销合作社组织到的饼肥和化学肥料，已经有七十万担。各地供销合作社今年准备供应的耕牛有一万多头。　（张先友）
