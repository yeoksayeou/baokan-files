    Welcome the Ten-Nation Conference Proposed by the Soviet Union
      Indonesian Prime Minister
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 17th] According to the Indonesian News Agency, Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo stated on the 15th that he does not object to the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a ten-nation conference, including Indonesia, to discuss the situation in the Taiwan region. He added that he would decide on his definite attitude towards the Soviet proposal after studying it. However, he said that in any case, he could agree to the principle of resolving the dangerous Taiwan issue through joint discussions.
      Indonesian Political Figures
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta: Indonesian political figures have expressed support for the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a ten-nation conference to resolve the Taiwan issue.
    The Indonesian "People's Daily" reported on the 15th that qualified political figures in Jakarta warmly welcomed the Soviet proposal.
    Parliamentarian Diapari said in the "People's Daily" that Indonesia must warmly welcome the Soviet proposal because it provides the possibility of peacefully resolving the Taiwan issue and easing international tensions. The Soviet proposal is appropriate and practical, and it also invites the United States to participate in the proposed conference because the United States has been deeply involved in the dispute between the People's Republic of China and the Kuomintang.
    When asked whether it would be difficult to realize this proposal, Diapari said that the difficulty mainly comes from the United States, because the United States recognizes the island it shelters as possessing the status of one of the five major powers, while refusing to recognize the government of the People's Republic of China.
    Diapari said: "The United States must know that it can no longer monopolize the atomic bomb or the hydrogen bomb. Western European countries do not want to be involved in war either. Therefore, if the United States insists on launching a war, it will have to do it alone."
      Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace
    [Xinhua News Agency, 16th] Rangoon dispatch: The Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace issued a statement on February 14th saying that it fully supports the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a ten-nation conference to resolve the situation in the Taiwan region.
    The Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace condemned the United States' naval and air forces for invading the Taiwan area and carrying out provocations, and pointed out that this kind of thing is a spark that creates a world war.
    The "Burma New Light" also published a commentary on the 14th saying: The Soviet proposal to hold an international conference on the Taiwan issue can be said to be a good phenomenon.
      Korean "Rodong Sinmun"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th] The Korean "Rodong Sinmun" published a commentary on the 15th entitled "The Soviet Union's Consistent Efforts to Safeguard Peace in the Far East," saying: The Soviet Union recently put forward a new initiative to convene a conference attended by relevant countries to eliminate the tense situation in the Taiwan region caused by American aggression. The Korean people warmly welcome and support the new initiative of the Soviet government. Experience has proved that a conference attended by relevant countries plays a positive role in resolving international disputes.
    The commentary said: Because the American and British representatives in the United Nations Security Council are unwilling to face up to the legitimate demands of the People's Republic of China, the Security Council cannot conduct a legitimate and fair review of the situation in the Taiwan region; it is impossible to take appropriate measures to ease the tension in this region and guarantee the national rights of the People's Republic of China. In response to this situation, the Soviet government has put forward another way to resolve the situation in the Taiwan region, which once again shows the Soviet Union's consistent desire and efforts to ease international tensions and maintain and consolidate world peace.
    The commentary concluded: The Korean people are convinced that the convening of such a conference will bring positive results to the resolution of the problems that have already been caused. At the same time, the results of this conference will make a huge contribution to promoting the resolution of other international issues and consolidating peace.
      Czechoslovak Newspapers
    [Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 16th] Major Czechoslovak newspapers on the 15th published articles welcoming and supporting the Soviet Union's recent proposal for a ten-nation conference to eliminate the tension caused by the US aggression against China's territory Taiwan.
    "Red Right Newspaper" said that accepting the Soviet initiative would increase the hope of resolving the Taiwan situation. The newspaper said, "Peace-loving people all over the world believe that it (the Soviet proposal) is the real way to eliminate the dangerous situation in the Taiwan region, after the US group made it impossible to obtain a fair solution in the Security Council."
    "People's Defense Newspaper" said that in the current situation, convening the ten-nation conference proposed by the Soviet Union would have a greater possibility of resolving the issue of US aggression against China than the Security Council.
      Indian Newspapers
    [Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 17th] The Urdu daily "New Century News" editorial on the 16th welcomed the Soviet proposal to hold a ten-nation conference on the Taiwan issue, saying: "The Soviet proposal is reasonable in all respects. Experience over the past few years has shown that international conferences like the one proposed by the Soviet Union have always been successful in easing world tensions." It added that the Soviet proposal "is the only correct way to resolve the Taiwan issue and ease tensions in Southeast Asia." The editorial also said: "The attempt to give the Chiang Kai-shek group the same status as the People's Republic of China is simply extremely absurd."
    The editorial pointed out that the US military presence in Taiwan completely violates international agreements and accused the United States of "interfering in China's civil war."
    The Bengali daily "Epoch-Making News" editorial on the 15th said: "According to the declaration of the Allied countries, Taiwan belongs to China - the word 'China' undoubtedly does not mean Chiang Kai-shek or Taiwan. Everything that belongs to China must belong to New China, and cannot belong to any rebel group that has been defeated and driven out of mainland China. Only the government established with the support of all the Chinese people and soldiers is the true representative of China; on the other hand, Chiang Kai-shek, who has been spurned by hundreds of millions of Chinese people and driven out of mainland China, is legally only a traitor. In other words, Chiang Kai-shek has no formal status in national or international law. On the contrary, he should be punished for being a traitor. In this case, how can New China agree to any representative of Taiwan participating in this conference?"

    欢迎召开苏联倡议的十国会议
      印度尼西亚总理
    【新华社雅加达十七日电】据印度尼西亚新闻社报道，印度尼西亚总理阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约十五日发表声明说，他并不反对苏联提出的召开包括印度尼西亚在内的十国会议以讨论台湾地区局势问题的建议。他又说，他要在研究苏联的建议之后再决定对它的明确的态度。不过，他说，不管怎样，他是能够同意通过共同讨论来解决危险的台湾问题这一原则的。
      印度尼西亚政界人士
    据新华社雅加达讯：印度尼西亚政界人士表示赞同苏联关于召开十国会议解决台湾问题的建议。
    印度尼西亚“人民日报”十五日报道说，雅加达有资格的政界人士热烈欢迎苏联建议。
    国会议员迪亚帕里在“人民日报”上说，印度尼西亚必须热烈欢迎苏联建议，因为这个建议为和平解决台湾问题和缓和国际紧张局势提供了可能性。苏联建议是适当的并且是切合实际的，它也邀请了美国参加建议中的会议，因为美国一直深深地卷入中华人民共和国同国民党之间的纠纷中。
    有人问到实现这个建议是不是有困难，迪亚帕里说，困难主要来自美国，因为美国承认它所庇护下的岛屿占有五大国之一的地位，而拒绝承认中华人民共和国政府。
    迪亚帕里说：“美国必须知道，它已不再能够垄断原子弹或氢弹了。西欧国家也不希望卷入战争。因此，如果美国硬要发动战争，它将不得不自己单独干。”
      缅甸保卫世界和平委员会
    【新华社十六日讯】仰光消息：缅甸保卫世界和平委员会在二月十四日发表文告说，它完全支持苏联关于召开十国会议解决台湾地区局势问题的建议。
    缅甸保卫世界和平委员会谴责美国的海、空军侵入台湾一带进行挑衅，并且指出，这种事情是一个制造世界大战的火种。
    “缅甸新光报”十四日也发表评论说：苏联建议举行台湾问题的国际会议，可以说是个好的现象。
      朝鲜“劳动新闻”
    【新华社平壤十六日电】朝鲜“劳动新闻”十五日发表题为“苏联为维护远东和平的一贯努力”的评论说：苏联最近提出了一项关于召开由有关国家参加的会议的新倡议，以消除由于美国的侵略而造成的台湾地区的紧张局势。朝鲜人民热烈欢迎和支持苏联政府的新倡议。经验证明，由有关国家参加的会议，对于解决国际争端所起的作用是肯定的。
    评论说：由于联合国安全理事会内的美国和英国代表不愿正视中华人民共和国的合法要求，使得安全理事会不可能对台湾地区局势的问题进行合法而公正的审议；不可能采取适当措施来和缓这一地区的紧张局势，保证中华人民共和国的民族权利。针对这种情况，苏联政府提出了解决台湾地区情势的又一途径，这又一次表明了苏联为缓和国际紧张局势、维护和巩固世界和平的一贯愿望和努力。
    评论最后说：朝鲜人民确信，这种会议的召开将为已经造成的问题的解决带来肯定的结果。同时这种会议的成果，将对促进其他国际问题的解决和巩固和平作出巨大的贡献。
      捷克斯洛伐克报纸
    【新华社布拉格十六日电】捷克斯洛伐克主要报纸十五日撰论表示欢迎和支持苏联最近提出的关于消除由于美国侵略中国领土台湾而引起的紧张局势的十国会议的建议。
    “红色权利报”说，接受苏联的倡议，就会增加解决台湾局势问题的希望。报纸说，“全世界爱好和平的人们认为，在美国集团使得在安全理事会中无法获得公正的解决之后，它（苏联的建议）是消除台湾地区的危险局势的真正途径。”
    “人民防线报”说，在目前情况下，召开苏联所提议的十国会议会比安全理事会具有更大的可能来解决美国对中国的侵略行为问题。
      印　度　报　纸
    【新华社新德里十七日电】乌尔都文日报“新世纪报”十六日的社论表示欢迎苏联提出的就台湾问题举行十国会议的建议，它说：“苏联建议从各方面来说都是合理的。过去几年的经验表明，像苏联建议的这种国际会议在缓和世界紧张局势方面一向是有成就的。”它又说，苏联的建议“是解决台湾问题和缓和东南亚紧张局势的唯一的正确办法。”社论还说：“要想使蒋介石集团获得跟中华人民共和国一样的地位的企图只是极端荒唐的事。”
    社论指出美国在台湾驻军完全违反国际协定，并且指责美国“干涉中国的内战”。
    孟加拉文日报“划时代报”十五日的社论说：“根据盟国的宣言，台湾属于中国——‘中国’这两个字无疑并不意味着蒋介石或台湾。属于中国的一切必须属于新中国，不能属于被打败了的和被赶出中国大陆的任何反叛集团。只有借全体中国人民和士兵的支持而建立起来的政府才是中国的真正代表；另一方面，遭到数亿中国人民的唾弃和被他们赶出中国大陆的蒋介石在法律上说来只不过是一个叛徒而已。换句话说，蒋介石在国家法律或国际法律中都是没有正式地位的。相反，他由于是一个卖国贼而应该受到惩罚。在这种情况下，新中国如何能同意台湾的任何代表参加这个会议呢？”
