From Hu Feng's Creative Work, We See the Bankruptcy of His Theory
    Yuan Shuipai

    In his "Explanation of Several Theoretical Issues" submitted to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Hu Feng arbitrarily distorted some of the fundamental principles repeatedly elucidated in Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," insisting that they were "knives" placed on the heads of writers, restricting their creative freedom. Among these "knives" that Hu Feng opposed, the foremost was the communist worldview. In the eyes of all progressive writers and artists striving for the socialist construction and transformation of the country, an advanced, scientific worldview is precisely their treasure. They strive to master this weapon so that it can help them correctly and profoundly understand the meaning and development laws of real life, so that they will not lose their way in actual struggles and creative labor. Why would it make Hu Feng hate it so much?

    Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" emphasized that writers should stand on the position of the working class, should master a revolutionary worldview, and study Marxism-Leninism. Obviously, if writers do not stand on the revolutionary position of the working class, what kind of working-class literature—socialist realist literature—would there be? What principled distinction would there be between working-class literature and bourgeois literature? Is demanding this distinction "falling into the theory of the LAPP"? Of course, people who stand on the position of the working class are not necessarily Marxists-Leninists, but they need to study (and generally are willing to study) Marxism-Leninism. Is it a crime to advocate that writers study Marxism? Comrade Mao Zedong said very clearly, "Studying Marxism is to make us observe the world, observe society, observe literature and art from the perspective of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, not to write philosophical lectures in literary and artistic works." But Hu Feng seemed not to have seen these words, so he insisted that this was advocating a dialectical materialist creative method. Recently, the Central Committee of the CPSU also called on writers in its congratulatory message to the Second All-Union Congress of Writers to "deeply study reality on the basis of creatively mastering Marxism-Leninism." Hu Feng, who claims to be a Marxist, showed strong revulsion to such calls, calling them "knives" and "iron bars" that "kill people as silently as pulling up grass"! Hu Feng claims to like to say things with emotion, but what kind of emotion is this?

    Hu Feng attempted to use a passage from Stalin, "Write truthfully! Let writers learn in life! If he can reflect the truth of life in a high artistic form, he will reach Marxism," as a shield, believing that Stalin did not mention "socialism," which meant that "socialist realism" should be changed to "realism," which meant denying the distinction between socialist realism and critical realism. Is this convincing? Writers standing on the people's position learn in life and "reflect the truth of life in a high artistic form," and they will indeed reach some basic Marxist viewpoints, but writers who cannot get rid of bourgeois prejudices, even though they subjectively "write truthfully," can forever stand on the anti-Marxist, anti-socialist, anti-working-class position. Such examples are not uncommon. There is no doubt that writers must write truthfully and must learn in life, but this must not be used to cancel and oppose Stalin's own complete scientific definition of socialist realism, namely: writers should truthfully, historically, and concretely depict reality from the revolutionary development of reality; the truthfulness and historical concreteness of artistic depictions must be combined with the task of ideologically transforming and educating the working people in the socialist spirit. Think about it with common sense: If writers themselves do not support socialism, can they still transform and educate the people ideologically in the socialist spirit?

    Hu Feng declared that a writer does not need to shift from a bourgeois individualist and liberalist position to a working-class socialist and communist position, but as long as he follows the methods he prescribes, such as "strengthening subjective fighting spirit," the writer can "reach" (the emphasis is on Hu Feng's original) Marxism. Practice is the only criterion for testing truth. Let us look at Hu Feng's own creative practice under the guidance of his own literary theory, and let us see whether what he has "moved towards and even reached" is indeed Marxism.

    The long poem "Time Has Begun!" published in four volumes with more than three thousand lines, is one of Hu Feng's major works. The entire poem is divided into five "musical movements": "Ode to Joy," "Hymn to Glory," "Ode to Youth" (not written), "Requiem," and another "Ode to Joy." The content mainly describes the author's feelings, memories, and imaginations at the founding ceremony of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949. We are not going to discuss every aspect of this work here, but only to examine the author's views on the individual and the masses, on history, on revolution, on literature and art, and on theory, as expressed in the poem. I believe that the author's views, which are his worldview, contain serious errors, thus hindering him from correctly understanding and expressing reality. Although the author wrote slogans such as "Long live the working people! Long live the proletariat! Long live internationalism!" and sentences such as "Hurrah for Marxism-Leninism" at the end of these poems, as if he had "reached" Marxism, in reality, he had neither reached Marxism nor reached realism. He promoted individualism and idealism in the most important parts of the poem and distorted the revolutionary movement.

    One of the striking features of Hu Feng's long poem is his own special status in the work. Of course, when celebrating the birth of the People's Republic of China, various poets will have different feelings and write different works. But it is surprising that Hu Feng not only hardly describes his own affection, wishes, and dedication to the people and the motherland, but also tries his best to praise himself under the guise of praising the motherland, and praises himself far more specifically and "sincerely" than he praises the motherland. In the existing four "musical movements," the "Requiem" is almost as long as the sum of the other three parts, and this part is less a memorial to the dead and more a memorial to himself. Hu Feng uses ninety pages to narrate his association with Qiu Dongping and Kobayashi Takiji. Is this really to sing about October 1, 1949? No! Look at these lines about Qiu Dongping:
    It was you
    Who revealed to me the dark side of the revolutionary struggle
    It was you
    Who made me see what kind of cold emotion
         a tested warrior could emit…
    Finally one day I received a letter from you
    As if boasting, you told me:
   “Recently
    I visited a brothel for a dollar
    My gonorrhea has recurred!”
    … When the grief lessened a little
    I weakly went to see you
    You heavily lowered your head
    Your voice was so low that it could only be heard so low;
   “I am very ashamed
    That I cannot become a Bolshevik! …”
    I felt you said heavy words
    But I could only lower my head
    And did not have the courage to answer anything
    Although a surge of joy welled up in my heart:
   “Brother! Brother!
    You understand
    You are awake
    How good…!”
    … Beloved, beloved motherland has lost you!
    The people have lost you!
    I have lost you!
    Look at some of his equally self-aggrandizing words about Kobayashi Takiji:
    Good brother
    China welcomes you
    Good brother
    I, welcome you…

    The time has come
    At a
        small gathering
    Where I was asked to speak
    I met you…
    The hand holding the pen trembled slightly
    And in the name of the “China Literary Association” I wrote a telegram
           Mourning you, paying tribute to you
               Protesting to the Great Japanese Empire!
                   Demonstrating to the Great Japanese Empire!
    I did not think I was presumptuous
    Even less did I feel I was stealing the name
    I want to tell the Great Japanese Empire panicked in front of your corpse
    I want to tell all the Japanese people grieving in front of your corpse
       The heroic Chinese people
            Sincerely love you, this glorious brother
       The heroic Chinese people will forever unite
            And advance under the sacred goal that you defended with your life!
    …
    Ah
    You laughed
    Your laugh was even more innocent than I remembered
    What!
    There seems to be a question mark in your smile
    Do you think I am just talking about myself
    Describing myself as a small grain of personal heroism?
    Besides saying that Hu Feng is doing self-promotion, how can you understand the reason why he imposed these narratives on the topic of the birth of the People's Republic of China? Writing an autobiography in a poem praising the motherland, repeatedly juxtaposing "I" and the motherland, this is not a small grain of personal heroism, but a large pile of personal heroism! Hu Feng's practice proves that he is indeed "self-expanding," but it is impossible to imagine how he will "reach Marxism."

    Hu Feng is not only "self-expanding" himself, but he also looks at the world with this individualistic eye. Let's look at Lu Xun in his writing:
    Boom～～!
    A day of light
    The joyful raging sacred fire rises
    Boom～～!
    A day of sound waves
    The joyful raging sacred music rises
    He is coming
       Tens of millions of strands of colorful threads all danced
                           Flying towards him
       Tens of millions of flowers all laughed
                           Facing towards him
       Every strand of colorful thread shot out
                   The light of grateful joy
       Every flower emitted
                   The color of grateful joy
       Every strand of colorful thread, every flower scattered
                   The fragrance of grateful joy
        …
      Lu Xun is coming!
      …
      You have come to conquer, are conquering
    The heavy suffering of the suffering people for whom you have pleaded before Mao Zedong!
    Here, although not quoted in full, it can already be seen that the great people's warrior Lu Xun is almost portrayed as Jesus Christ!

    Similarly, Hu Feng also distorted the image of Comrade Mao Zedong, depicting him as a god standing in the clouds, detached from the masses. The very beginning of the entire long poem reads:
       …
       He
       Stands like a statue…
       …
       Mao Zedong, he sent a voice to the world
       Mao Zedong, he issued an order to time
                  “Advance!!!”
        ………
       Mao Zedong
       He stands firmly on that highest peak
       As if he is announcing to himself
       Which is also to the whole world:
        ………
       I am the sea
       I want to be big
       Big enough to be able to
           Embrace the world
       Big enough to be able to
           Flow through forever
    This kind of leader in Hu Feng's writing who announces to himself and the world "I am the sea" "I want to be big" is so distant from the real image of Comrade Mao Zedong, who has been closely connected with the masses in revolutionary struggles for a long time! How different is this exaggerated tone from Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts of "being honest and diligent," "willing to be an ox for the people," and "willing to be a primary school student"! Hu Feng sometimes compares Comrade Mao Zedong to "Pangu who created the world," "the giant in myths," and sometimes says that he is "a newly born innocent child," "a girl in first love." What does this have to do with Comrade Mao Zedong's image? It is not meaningless to compare Hu Feng's portrayal of Comrade Mao Zedong with some fragments of Mayakovsky's "Lenin":
     Could it be
     That about Lenin one could say—
     “A leader
         granted by God”?
     If
     He were
         belonging to emperors and heaven,
     I
    would not be able to restrain
             my anger,
     I
       would
         rush headlong
        into the funeral procession,
             blocking the crowd sending him off.
       ……
       He, just like
         you and I,
               is completely the same person,
     However,
       thought
         may have dug
       more wrinkles
           near his eye sockets
              than ours,
        and his lips
           are more skilled at satire,
                     more firm and strong, than ours.
    Hu Feng likes to quote Mayakovsky, but do he and Mayakovsky have anything in common? Mayakovsky truly portrayed Lenin, while the Comrade Mao Zedong that Hu Feng wrote reveals Hu Feng's own shadow…

    Exaggerating the role of the individual inevitably leads to belittling the role of the people. Hu Feng also praises the people and their struggles in his poem, but the following passage best expresses his view of the people and the revolution:
    People
    Suffering people
    You finally—
    Awakened
    Can see
    Can understand
    Feel bored
    Think of suffering
    Feel pain
    Cry out!
    Laugh out!
    You want to live!
    You want to love!
    …
    On the road of history
    For how many centuries
    You were insects and ants
    Taking life as fertilizer and dung
    But today
    Dawn shines on your hearts
    In an instant
    You become beasts with ten thousand heads
    On the land of the motherland
    Planting your blood-dripping heads!
           Planting them continuously!
   As seeds!
    According to Hu Feng, the Chinese people in the past could not even feel bitterness and boredom, and had been sleeping like blind and deaf people. Considering that he insisted in his theoretical articles that all the Chinese people in the past were "flies" that were "stumbling around," it can be seen that this is not an exaggeration, but a slander. And what happens after the moment of dawn? It turns out that the people's task is to "plant your blood-dripping heads" "continuously" "on the land of the motherland!" This similar statement elsewhere becomes his political call:
     “Go shed blood! Go sacrifice your lives!”
     “If there is a raging fire, jump into it! If there is a sharp blade, rush at it! If there are thorns, stick into them!”
      “Go love! Go cry! Go laugh! Go die! Go burn and explode! Go be calm and cold!”
    What does it mean to call on the Chinese people to "go die!"? In revolutionary struggle, there must be sacrifice, and highly politically conscious people's warriors possess the spirit of self-sacrifice for the revolution, and the Party educates them in this way. But the Party has never regarded sacrifice as a goal, calling on the people to "go die," as Hu Feng says here. Also, what does it mean to "go be cold"?

    Of course, poets are fully entitled to fantasize, but readers are also entitled to study the meaning of the poet's fantasy. Here, I think, first, Hu Feng clearly gives an overly dark color to sacrifice in the revolution (because of this, not only is Hu Feng's own heart filled with the phantom of the sacrificed, but also makes the Comrade Mao Zedong in his writing also filled with the phantom of the sacrificed); second, and more importantly, Hu Feng also gives a particularly dark color to the revolution itself. Hu Feng's intriguing statement that the Party called on the people to "go be cold" is only one end of this mood of his.

    Hu Feng so vehemently discusses the "dark side" of the revolutionary movement and the revolutionary literary and artistic movement in his poem, promoting his views on revolution and literature and art, that in most cases he abandons his original extremely reluctant poetic form and truly writes philosophical lectures. I have already quoted him as saying that Qiu Dongping "revealed to me the dark side in the middle of the revolutionary struggle." Now, look at his more detailed discussion (because these were originally prose, to save space, I will not divide the lines as in the original text, and I will add punctuation):
    "I embraced the longing for pursuit, but in the small corners I could reach, there was looking left and right, there was indifference, there was pretense, there was no surprise or joy, there was seeming to swallow and spit out, there was half-advance and half-retreat, there was true and false averaging, there was emptiness is form… I embraced the longing for pursuit, but I was apprehensive that I could not find the sincerity of sincerity for the struggle, the love of love for truth.
    "Sincerity! Sincerity! Where are you? Love! Love! Where are you?"
    "Sixteen years have passed, what have I done? In this motherland of mine, a motherland suffering but fighting heroically, I have suffered, and I have also been lazy. In the first two years, I even committed the same kind of mistakes that you (referring to Kobayashi Takiji) could not get rid of. I actually wanted to launch a battle with dogmatic language, I actually thought that thought could not pass through the blood of life, I actually forgot how the purity of love, the happiness of labor, the sweetness of thought, the passion of creation, and the joy of struggle grow up and grow up; I actually forgot that our struggle and labor can only have one starting point, that is the humble love or desire, humble hatred or pain of the working people, our future road can only be elevated and gathered from there, and must not be cold-hearted reasons that are not integrated with them and added to them from the outside.
    "In this ancient country of ours, there has accumulated more than can be accumulated piles of written garbage, stacked layer upon layer around the people, surrounding the working minds, wanting to surround them so that they cannot breathe, we have what right to instead usurp their names, and add another stack of waste paper written with cold-hearted words on top of it? We have what right to instead usurp their names, and treat them as puppets, wanting them to recite some cold or empty words, making them feel goosebumps all over their bodies when they see and hear them, making them lose their love and hate for the world, reducing their strength for life, and making them see the struggle as having nothing to do with their own flesh and blood life?
    "Thank you for the dark soul of this ancient country, it disguised itself as a smiling face and suddenly gave me a muffled blow, it stunned me and also woke me up. I felt a fever all over, and then I felt cold all over. I seemed to suddenly understand that anyone who wants to be a soldier fighting with words must see himself as humble, humble, even more humble in front of the people and in front of the struggle, humble to the point of having nothing to rely on except sincerity, humble to the point that if he has not felt, suffered, or rejoiced in his own heart, he would not dare to offer it to the struggle. Anyone who wants to be a soldier fighting with words must hatch a spark of labor love in his own heart, even if it is so weak that he cannot feel it himself, but everyone has blood. If words do not carry body temperature (even if it is stained with one's own scabies), they have no face to put them into this fighting world!" Hu Feng would say that what he is talking about here is only the literary and artistic front and the issue of literary and artistic creation. But readers cannot help but ask: Is the sincerity and love in the world really only concentrated on Hu Feng and the very few people he has chosen? If so, what literary and artistic front can there be? If the literary and artistic front is like this, what basis is there to say that the entire revolutionary front is not like this? Except for waiting for "time to come," to be rectified by great figures like Hu Feng with "sincerity of sincerity" and "love of love," what hope is there to overcome the shortcomings of these fronts? Is the people's way out not a despair? And what exactly is the sincerity and love that Hu Feng is talking about? Isn't there sincerity and love of different content for each class? People's literary and artistic creators must have sincerity and love for the people, there is no dispute about this, we must oppose all hypocritical and indifferent writers and works, but isn't the great significance of socialist realist literature and all progressive literature in history for the people first of all in their ideological content based on the truth of life? Is it necessary to deny the significance of thought, deny the class nature of literature and art, deny the historical materialist view of literature and art, and embrace an idealist view of literature and art in order to oppose the tendency of conceptualization and formularization in literary and artistic creation, and to oppose the vulgar sociological attitude towards classical literature and art?

    Hu Feng is completely mired in the quagmire of individualism and idealism here.

    Hu Feng uses all kinds of vicious words to curse the phenomena of conceptualization and formularization in literary and artistic creation, but he opposes this phenomenon from idealism rather than realism. The phenomena of formularization and conceptualization in revolutionary literary and artistic creation are generally to be explained by a lack of understanding and experience of realist aesthetics, and not by a lack of sincerity and love, in the same way that a farmer's cultivation and failure to obtain the expected harvest is not due to a lack of sincerity and love. As for writers inappropriately making the characters in their works speak for themselves, of course, it is not to be commended, but this is not only a common problem among beginners in writing, it is common in classical and romantic writers, and even realist writers can hardly completely avoid it. Gorky, in the play "The Lower Depths," borrowed the mouth of the tramp Satin to say the famous saying "Man, that name is glorious!" and many other thoughts of the author himself, but the author himself also believes that such words are out of tune with Satin's tone (see page 155 of the People's Literature Publishing House edition of "The Lower Depths"). Can we therefore slander these writers as usurping the names of the people, treating the people as puppets, and so on?

    Hu Feng holds such fervent hatred for the revolutionary tendencies in literary and artistic works that, although immature, are ultimately new, and still says, "I will forever hate 'that kind of concubine's 'morality' that is so calm and peaceful with the old situation, and so disapproving of the newer opportunities; so yielding in every possible way with the established situation, and so demanding and critical with the nascent things' (Lu Xun)!" Isn't this slapping himself in the face?

    Hu Feng believes that literature and art can only have one starting point, that is, relying on "original vitality," "subjective fighting spirit," "honesty," "pure heart," "sincerity," "humble feelings," "will," "sincere heart," and so on. Moreover, this is not only the basis for the development of literature and art, but also the basis for the development of the entire history.
    These qualities…
    Relying on them
    The people can create history while shedding blood
    And relying on them
    They have withstood such eerie historical pressure
    Hu Feng's theory has been consistent for a long time before and after liberation. In 1946, he wrote: "People always have something to rely on and something to hope for, otherwise they cannot live… Even if it is a humble feeling, mankind has multiplied by it, history has developed by it, to put it exaggeratedly, all the grand and fierce social reforms and great struggles have also arisen by it. Slaves who are not born but forced to be slaves will explode their 'wildness' for survival when they can no longer endure and cannot survive." ("For Tomorrow") In 1948, he wrote: "People who live in social relations based on economic relations, bear the heavy burden of labor under heavy exploitation and slavery, bear it kindly, bear it strongly, they cannot live without sweating, and even cannot live without bleeding, but they 'stand on solid ground' and bear it with sweat and blood on the earth. This great spirit is the backbone of the world." ("On the Road of Realism") In 1952, he wrote: "Under long-term class oppression and national humiliation,… these precious qualities become stronger and stronger in the wind and frost of history, are forever immortal, and are constantly growing. Relying on these, the working people created history under the conditions of being bound, and created such a great national tradition for us; relying on these, the working people changed the historical situation and will create a completely new history. This love, this hate, this will, we call them the vital elements of history, or simply enthusiasm." ("Being with New Characters")

    Yes! Very "simple"! After all, it is not difficult to understand. It just says that the fundamental driving force of social change and historical development is the desire of people to survive, the desire of people to reproduce their descendants, and the animalistic instinct of people. In the more mysterious words of Shu Wu, who once followed Hu Feng, it is the so-called "unceasing heavenly heart," and in the more straightforward words of Hu Feng, it is the "wildness for survival." This bourgeois idealist view of history that worships "instinct" and advocates elusive "enthusiasm" and "vital elements" cannot hide its original form even if it is draped with beautiful words such as "social economic relations" and "class oppression." Perhaps Hu Feng is not, as he falsely accuses others when attacking them, trying to "completely cancel the literary and artistic movement and give it to Chiang Kai-shek or jointly occupy it with Chiang Kai-shek," but "at the very least" he wants to give "the road of history" and "the road of the future" to bourgeois idealists, or "jointly occupy" it with bourgeois idealists.

    Marxists have a different view of history than Hu Feng. Marxists believe that the main force determining the development of social history is not people's subjective spirit. Stalin told us in "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism": "The key to studying the laws of social history is not to seek in people's minds, in the views and ideas of society, but to seek in the mode of production adopted by society in each historical period, that is, to seek in the economy of society."

    But does our Mr. Hu Feng not still want to "be responsible to history and the Party" and "strengthen the connection with the people"? In front of the people, this coat of "Marxism" still cannot but be draped on! If it is not draped on, how can idealism "reach" Marxism? The last resort is to perform a magic trick, let "this feeling," "this emotion," this "enthusiasm," this "wildness," this "great spirit" of "the backbone of the world," that is, this thing called "the vital element of history" change:
    Grew up
    Became stronger
    Became the vital element of collectivism
    Making a new period appear in Chinese history—
    It turns out that "your" collectivism is also "our" idealism. You say I have no class viewpoint? Then I will change it for you and add a "collectivism" hat. Has it changed? It is truly "responding to all changes with constancy" "Although it has undergone twists and turns, it has finally maintained this emotional experience" (Hu Feng's words in the postscript of this long poem), it is still this "vital element," it is still this "great spirit," it is still my Hu Feng's idealist view of history!

    An idealist view of history naturally produces an idealist view of art. We have seen earlier that Hu Feng uses "sincerity" rather than real life as the basis for literary and artistic creation and literary and artistic criticism, and this is precisely the idealist thought that is completely unrelated to Marxism or realism. Hu Feng's idealist view of literature and art has also been consistent for a long time. In his "On the Road of Realism," published before liberation, Hu Feng repeatedly emphasized the importance of the writer's "sincerity," emphasizing it to the point where it is the only criterion. Later, Hu Feng repeatedly explained that it was because the environment was not free and he had to use "slave language" to speak. But is "Time Has Begun!" also using "slave language"? Similarly, in the paper "Bless the Motherland, Bless the People!" written in 1950, Hu Feng, when guiding a young writer in writing, still said: "In our great era, in our great motherland, as long as there is a sincere heart, as long as it starts from the feelings of flesh and blood life, you can hear beautiful and moving sincere voices anytime and anywhere…" It can be seen that Hu Feng insisted on using this super-class moral standard that even the bourgeoisie can agree with as the standard for literary and artistic creation, and he cannot use the writing conditions before liberation to disguise it. In his "Explanation of Several Theoretical Issues," he simply equated his super-class concept of "sincerity" with the concept of communist party spirit. He said: "Such loyalty and humility are precisely the party spirit we require in this field (referring to the literary and artistic field)." He also said: "A writer, if he is a sincere writer, if he is a writer with party spirit (which, for us, is synonymous with 'artistic conscience'), he can only combine with the object that corresponds to the foundation he can have, this combination is sincere, and the object can pass through his wisdom, his heart, and become a seed to be created into a real, touching work of art." What is the result of Hu Feng's punching and kicking, drawing symbols and chanting incantations, dodging and weaving, twisting and turning, and playing with words in hundreds of thousands of words of reports? It is nothing more than this: sincerity is party spirit, and party spirit is artistic conscience!

    It is nothing more than this, returning to the origin: party spirit equals sincerity and conscience, revolutionary worldview equals "personality power," class nature equals super-class nature, materialism equals idealism…

    Fadeyev, at the Second All-Union Congress of Writers, when talking about Pomelantsev's theory of "sincerity in literature," said that true literature cannot but be sincere and upright, but the critics who raised the issue of "sincerity" were "hoping that the great Soviet literature would abandon the communist ideas that inspire it and become a conductor of alien ideas." Do these words not also apply to Hu Feng?

    Communist party spirit is most precious to writers who attempt to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers and serve the general line, whether they are party members or non-party members. Party spirit is not only not a "stick" or "knife" that binds their thoughts and feelings, but it gives them the power to judge truth and falsehood, evaluate good and evil, and distinguish between essential and non-essential, typical and non-typical things, and it is the element that makes their works obtain true value. Party spirit can give them true freedom, freedom to create for the education of the new generation!

    But what can Hu Feng's subjective method of creation give writers? Hu Feng's own creative practice, his long poem, is one of the answers. He held his own "party spirit"—"sincerity," believing that as long as he is loyal to himself, loyal to his own subjectivity, believing that as long as he strengthens "subjective fighting spirit," "self-expansion," "analyzes himself," "overcomes his own double personality," and does not need to delve into the masses and study life, he can write good works. But what was the result? The result was distorting the people and history, fabricating typical characters, and smearing his own individualism and idealism on the object. Hu Feng's creative practice fully proves the bankruptcy of his literary theory!

    Hu Feng once shouted loudly, "For several years, lyric poetry has been suppressed to the point where it cannot breathe." Looking at the current publications, lyric poetry is still active. It is Hu Feng's own theory that is harming lyric poetry, destroying the national and world traditions of poetry, and completely dispersing, theorizing, speaking, and sloganizing poetry. Is it possible to produce the effect of poetry by dividing sentences like "Long live the working people! Long live the proletariat! Long live internationalism! Long live the liberation of all mankind!" or "The people are immortal! Love is immortal! Labor is immortal! Creation is immortal! Truth is immortal! The motherland is immortal! The earth is immortal! The stars are immortal! The great universe is immortal!" into lines, adding some symbols in the middle of each line, and printing them in bold, or by dividing many lines into varying lengths according to some unknown standard, and arranging them high or low? Is denying a certain content and a certain form of poetry (the form of poetry gives the vast majority of readers a common and clear sense of rhythm, which Mayakovsky strictly respected, so his poems have strict meter, and many poems have rhyme, but some people in China who call themselves his believers do not know or do not admit it) making poetry flourish or wither, is it making poetry deeply penetrate the people or detach from the people? Not only is the entire form of Hu Feng's poem detached from the people, but also many sections and lines show great affectation, and are sometimes simply incomprehensible. For example:
    They use charcoal to bake your chest
    They use fire chopsticks to bake your temples
    The magic fire burned into you like this
    The hatred in your heart burned even more vigorously
        Burned into a red-hot iron
    A fierce burning day and night
    Finally (!!!)
    Your blood boiled!
    Your nerves snapped!
    Your heart exploded!
    The author's idealist confusion of expression makes it difficult for readers to understand whether it was the reactionaries who killed Kobayashi, or whether the victim's own hatred burned himself to death. As for sentences like "The small scar on the eyelid also seems to sing a love song drunkenly," "He tightly embraced Mao Zedong's blood temperature," and "On the joyful sea of blood cells," they are even more characteristic of Hu Feng's rhetoric that only cares about himself and does not care about the reader. Such creative practice also proves the bankruptcy of his literary theory!

    从胡风的创作看他的理论的破产
    袁水拍
    胡风在他向中共中央提出的“关于几个理论性问题的说明材料”中，把毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”所反复阐明的一些根本原则，任意地加以歪曲，硬说是放在作家头上的“刀子”，限制了他们的创作自由。胡风所反对的这些“刀子”之中，那名列前茅的一把是共产主义世界观。在所有要求进步的、为了国家的社会主义建设和改造事业而奋斗的作家艺术家看来，先进的、科学的世界观正是他们的宝贝。他们力求掌握这个武器，使它能够帮助他们去正确地深刻地认识现实生活的意义和发展规律，使他们在实际斗争中、创作劳动中不致迷失方向。它为什么会使胡风憎恨呢？
    毛泽东同志的“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”强调作家应该站到工人阶级立场上来，应该掌握革命的世界观，学习马克思列宁主义。很明显，作家不站在工人阶级的革命立场上，那还有什么工人阶级的文学——社会主义现实主义的文学呢？那还有什么工人阶级的文学和资产阶级的文学的原则区别呢？难道要求这种区别，这就是“掉进了拉普派的理论”吗？当然，站在工人阶级立场上的人们不等于就是马克思列宁主义者，但是他们需要学习（一般地也愿意学习）马克思列宁主义。向作家提倡学习马克思主义，这难道就是犯罪吗？毛泽东同志说得很明白，“学习马克思主义，是要我们用辩证唯物论和历史唯物论的观点去观察世界，观察社会，观察文学艺术，并不是要我们在文学艺术作品中写哲学讲义。”可是胡风似乎没有看见这些话，所以还要硬说这就是提倡辩证唯物主义的创作方法。最近苏共中央在致第二次全苏作家代表大会的祝词中也号召作家们“在创造性地掌握马克思列宁主义的基础上，深入研究现实”。自命为马克思主义者的胡风却偏偏对这类号召表现强烈的反感，称之为“杀人如草不闻声”的“刀子”和“铁棍子”！胡风自称喜欢说带有情绪的话，然而这是什么样的一种情绪呢？
    胡风企图利用斯大林的一段谈话，“写真实！让作家在生活中学习罢！如果他能用高度的艺术形式反映出了生活真实，他就会达到马克思主义”，来作挡箭牌，认为斯大林没有提到“社会主义”，也就是要把“社会主义现实主义”删改为“现实主义”，也就是否认社会主义现实主义和批判的现实主义的区别。这是能够叫人信服的吗？站在人民立场的作家在生活中学习，并且“用高度的艺术形式反映出了生活真实”，确是会达到马克思主义的若干基本观点的，但是不能摆脱资产阶级偏见的作家虽然主观上也在“写真实”，却可以永远站在反马克思主义、反社会主义、反工人阶级的立场上，这种事例并不少见啊。毫无疑问，作家必须写真实，必须在生活中学习，但是这决不能用来取消和反对斯大林本人所提出的关于社会主义现实主义的完整的科学的定义，即：作家应该从现实的革命发展中真实地、历史地和具体地描写现实；艺术描写的真实性和历史具体性必须同用社会主义精神从思想上改造和教育劳动人民的任务结合起来。用常识想一想吧，作家自己不拥护社会主义，还能用社会主义精神从思想上改造和教育人民吗？
    胡风宣称，一个作家不需要从资产阶级的个人主义自由主义立场转到工人阶级的社会主义共产主义立场，而只要按照他所规定的办法，比如“加强主观战斗精神”之类，作家就可以“达到”（重点是胡风原有的）马克思主义了。实践是检验真理的唯一标准，让我们来看一看胡风本人在他自己的文艺理论指导下的创作实践吧，让我们看一看他“走向以至达到”了的，究竟是不是马克思主义。
    分成四册出版的三千多行的长诗“时间开始了！”是胡风的主要创作之一。全诗共分五个“乐篇”：“欢乐颂”，“光荣赞”，“青春颂”（没有写），“安魂曲”和再一个“欢乐颂”。内容写的主要是作者在一九四九年十月一日中华人民共和国开国大典上的感受、回忆和想像。这里不准备讨论这个作品的每个方面，只是就诗中所表现出来的作者对个人和人民群众的看法，对历史的看法，对革命的看法，对文艺和理论的看法，作一些考察。我认为作者的这些看法，也就是他的世界观，是含有严重的错误的，因而妨害了他去正确地认识和表现现实。作者在这些诗篇的结尾部分固然写了像“劳动人民—万岁！无产阶级—万岁！国际主义—万岁！”等等的口号，以及“向马列主义欢呼”等等的句子，好像是“达到”了马克思主义的，但是在实际上，他却既没有达到马克思主义，也没有达到现实主义。他在诗的最重要部分宣传了个人主义和唯心主义，并且歪曲了革命运动。
    胡风的长诗的一个显著特点，就是在这个作品中他自己的特殊的地位。当然，在歌颂中华人民共和国诞生的时候，各个诗人会有不同的感触，写出不同的作品。但是令人惊异的是，胡风不但简直没有描写自己对于人民和祖国的依慕、愿望和献身的热情，而且在歌颂祖国的名义下竭力歌颂自己，而且歌颂自己远比歌颂祖国具体得多，“真诚”得多。在已有的四个“乐篇”中，“安魂曲”差不多同其他三部分的总和一样长，而这个部分与其说是纪念死者，还不如说是纪念自己。胡风用九十页的篇幅来叙述他同丘东平和小林多喜二的交往，这难道真是为着歌唱一九四九年十月一日吗？不是的！请看下面这些关于丘东平的诗行吧：是你
    向我揭开了革命斗争中间的黑暗面是你
    使我看见了一个经过了考验的战士
          能够发出怎样一种冰冷的情感……终于有一天我接到了你一封信好像夸耀似地告诉了我：
    “最近
    逛了一块钱的窑子
    淋病又发了！”……当悲痛减轻了一些我无力地走去看你你沉重地低下了头声音低得只能够听见地那么低；
    “我很惭愧
    不能成为一个布尔塞维克！……”我感到你说了沉重的话但我也只能低下了头没有勇气回答出什么虽然我心里涌出了一股欢乐：
    “兄弟！兄弟！
    你懂了
    你醒了
    多么好……！”……亲爱的亲爱的祖国失去了你！人民失去了你！我失去了你！再看他关于小林多喜二的一些同样自我吹嘘的话：
    好兄弟
    中国迎接你
    好兄弟
    我，迎接你……
    时间到了
    在一个要我谈话的
        小小的集会上
    我遇见了你……
    我拿着笔的手有些发抖
    用“中国文总”的名义写了一个电文
          为你哀悼，向你致敬
            向大日本帝国抗议！
              向大日本帝国示威！
    我没有想到我自己僭妄
    更没有觉得我是在盗用名义
    我要告诉在你尸体前面发了慌的大日本帝国
    我要告诉在你尸体前面悲愤着的全日本人民
        英勇的中国人民
          至诚地敬爱你这个光荣的兄弟
        英勇的中国人民要永远团结在那个
            你用生命保卫了的神圣的目标下面前进的！    ……
    呵
    你笑了
    你笑得比我记得的笑还要天真
    怎么！
    你的笑里好像有一点问号
    是不是以为我尽在说着自己
    把自己说成了一小粒个人英雄主义？
    除了说胡风是为着自我宣传以外，你怎么能够理解他把这些叙述强加在中华人民共和国诞生这个题目上的理由呢？在歌颂祖国的诗篇里写自传，口口声声把“我”和祖国并列，这不是什么一小粒个人英雄主义，而是一大堆个人英雄主义啊！胡风的实践证明了他确是在“自我扩张”，却无法叫人想像他究竟会怎样“达到马克思主义”。
    胡风不仅自己在“自我扩张”而已，他而且用这种个人主义的眼睛来看世界。我们看他笔下的鲁迅吧：
    轰～～！
    一天光明
    欢乐的熊熊圣火升起了
    轰～～！
    一天音流
    欢乐的雄雄圣乐升起了
    他来了
      千千万万缕的彩线都欢舞了起来
                            飞向着他
        千千万万朵的花都欢笑了起来
                            朝向着他
        每一缕彩线都射出了
                    感激的欢乐的光辉
        每一朵花都发出了
                    感激的欢乐的彩色
        每一缕彩线每一朵花都散出了
                    感激的欢乐的香味
        ……
      鲁迅来了！
      ……
      你来到了把你所请命的苦难的人民底重重苦难征
    服了、征服着的毛泽东底前面！
    在这里，虽然没有引全，已经可以看出，伟大的人民战士鲁迅几乎被表现成为耶稣基督了！
    同样，胡风也把毛泽东同志的形象歪曲地描画成为脱离人民群众的站到了云端里的神。整个长诗的一开头就写着：
      ……
      他
      屹立着像一尊塑像……
      ……
      毛泽东，他向世界发出了声音
      毛泽东，他向时间发出了命令
                “进军！！！”
       ………
      毛泽东
      他屹然地站在那最高峰上
      好像他在向着自己
      也就是向着全世界宣布：
      ………
      我是海
      我要大
      大到能够
          环抱世界
      大到能够
          流贯永远
    这种向自己和全世界宣布“我是海”“我要大”……的胡风笔下的领导者的面貌，同长期在革命斗争中密切结合群众的毛泽东同志的真实形象是有多么大的距离！这种夸大口气同毛泽东同志经常说的“老老实实，勤勤恳恳”、“甘为孺子牛”“甘当小学生”的思想是多么不同！胡风一忽儿把毛泽东同志比做“开天辟地的盘古”，“神话里的巨人”，一忽儿又说他是“一个新生的赤子”，“一个初恋的少女”，这些又同毛泽东同志的形象有什么相干呢？拿胡风所描写的毛泽东同志同马雅可夫斯基的“列宁”的一些片断作一个比较不是无意义的：
     难道
    关于列宁也可以说——
    “上帝恩赐的
            领袖”？
     假如
    他是
        属于帝王的和上天的，
     我
  决不能抑制住
            自己的愤怒，
     我
      一定要
        横冲直撞地
       奔入葬仪的行列，
            挡住送葬的人群。
      ……
      他，正同
        你和我，
              完全是一样的人，
     不过，
      思想
        在他的眼窝附近
      也许掘下了
          比我们
                更多的皱纹，
       而他的嘴唇
          比我们的
                    更善于讽刺，更坚决强硬。
    胡风是喜欢引用马雅可夫斯基的，但是他和马雅可夫斯基难道有相同的地方吗？马雅可夫斯基真实地刻划了列宁，而胡风所写的毛泽东同志却显出了胡风自己的影子……
    夸大个人的作用，就不能不贬低人民的作用。胡风在诗里也歌颂了人民和人民的斗争，但是下面的一段诗却最足以表现他对人民和革命的看法：
     人民
     苦难的人民
     你们终于——
     醒过来了
     看得见了
  听得懂了
  觉得闷了
  想到苦了
  感到痛了
  哭出来了！
  笑出来了！
  你要活了！
  你要爱了！
    ……
    在历史的路程上
    多少多少世纪了
    你们是虫豸是蝼蚁
     把生命当作了肥料和粪土
    但今天
    黎明照到了你们的心上
    一瞬间
    你们变成了万头的猛兽
     在祖国大地上
     把滴着鲜血的头颅种下去！
            不断地种下去！
   当作种子！
    按照胡风看来，中国人民过去竟是连苦和闷也感觉不到，同瞎子聋子一样，一直在睡觉的。想到他在理论文章中硬说过去所有的中国人民是“乱碰”的“苍蝇”，可以看出这不是夸张，而是诬蔑。而且在黎明的一瞬间之后又怎样呢？原来人民的任务就是“在祖国大地上”“把滴着鲜血的头颅种下去！”“不断地种下去！”这种类似的说法在另外的地方就变成了他的政治号召：
     “去流血！去献命！”
     “有烈火就跳到烈火里面去！有刀尖就扑到刀尖上面
       去！有荆棘就插进荆棘中间去！”
      “去爱！去哭！去笑！去死！去燃烧、爆裂！去沉着、冰冷！”
    号召中国人民“去死！”这究竟是什么意思呢？在革命斗争中必须有牺牲，有高度政治觉悟的人民战士具备着献身革命的自我牺牲精神，党也是这样教育他们的。但党从来也没有把牺牲当成一个目标，号召人民“去死”，像胡风在这里所说的。还有，什么叫做“去冰冷”呢？
    当然，诗人是完全有权幻想的，但是读者也有权研究诗人的幻想的意义。在这里，我以为，第一，胡风显然是给革命中的牺牲以一种过于阴暗的色彩（因为这样，不但胡风自己心中充满了牺牲者的幻影，而且使他笔下的毛泽东同志心中也同样充满了牺牲者的幻影）；第二，更重要的，胡风还给了革命本身以一种特别阴暗的色彩。胡风耐人寻味地说党号召人民去“冰冷”，还只是他的这种心情的一端而已。
    胡风在他的诗中这样激昂地讨论着革命运动和革命文艺运动的“黑暗面”，宣传着他的革命观和文艺观，以至在多数场合都放弃了他的本来极其勉强的诗的形式，而真的写成了哲学讲义。上面已经引过他说的丘东平向他“揭开了革命斗争中间的黑暗面”，现在，看他的比较详细的议论吧（因为这些本来就是散文，为了节省篇幅，就不照原文分行，并且代加上标点）：
    “我抱着了追求的渴望，但在走得到的小角落里，有的是左顾右盼，有的是爱理不理，有的是装模作样，有的是不惊不喜，有的是似吞似吐，有的是半进半退，有的是真假平均，有的是空即是色……。我抱着了追求的渴望，但我惶恐着不能找到那个对于斗争的真诚的真诚，那个对于真理的爱情的爱情。
    “真诚！真诚！你在哪里呢？爱情！爱情！你在哪里呢？”
    “十六个年头了，我做了什么呢？在我这个祖国，苦痛着但却英勇地战斗着的祖国，我苦痛过，我也怠惰过。在最初的两年，还犯了你（指小林多喜二）摆脱不了的同类的错误。我居然想用教条的语言发动战斗，我居然以为思想可以不通过生活底血液，我居然忘记了爱情底纯真、劳动底幸福、思想底甜蜜、创造底情热、斗争底欢乐是怎样生长起来成长起来的；我居然忘记了我们的斗争和劳动只能够有一个起点，那就是劳动人民底卑微的爱情或愿望，卑微的仇恨或痛苦，我们的未来的道路只能够从那里提升起来汇集起来，决不能是不和那些结成一体的、从身外加给他们的冷情的道理。
    “在我们这个古国，已经积起了多得不能再多的文字垃圾堆，一层一层地堆在人民底周围，把劳动的心灵团团地围住，想把他们围得不能呼吸不能喘气，我们有什么权利反而盗用他们的名字，在那上面再添上一叠写着冷情的文字的废纸？我们有什么权利反而盗用他们的名字，把他们当作傀儡，要他们背出一些冷话或空话，让他们自己看了听了身上起鸡皮疙瘩，反而对世界失去了爱憎，反而对生活减少了力气，反而把斗争看成了和他们自己的血肉生活毫无关系？
    “感谢这古国底黑暗的灵魂，它化装成了一付笑脸，突然兜头给了我一个闷棍，它把我打昏了，也把我打醒了。我感到通身发烫，又感到通身发冷。我好像突然懂得了，谁想做一个用文字作战的士兵，他就得在人民面前、在斗争面前，把自己看得卑微、卑微、更卑微，卑微到除了真诚一无所恃，卑微到如果不是在自己的心灵上感受过、痛苦过、欢乐过的东西，就不敢向斗争献出。谁想做一个用文字作战的士兵，他就得在自己的心灵里面孵出一粒劳动爱情的圣火，即使那微弱得自己不能够感到，但血液谁都是有的。文字如果没有带着体温（即使那沾上了自己的疮臭），就没有脸放它们到这个战斗着的世界上去！”胡风会说，他在这里说的只是文艺战线和文艺创作问题。但是读者不能不问：难道天地间的真诚和爱情当真只集中于胡风和他选中的极少数几个人身上吗？如果是这样，还能有什么文艺战线？如果文艺战线是这样，又有什么根据说整个革命战线不是这样呢？除了等待“时间到了”，可以由胡风这类伟大人物凭“真诚的真诚”和“爱情的爱情”来加以整顿以外，又有什么希望来克服这些战线的缺点呢？人民的出路不就是一个绝望吗？而且胡风所说的真诚和爱情究竟是什么东西呢？难道不是有各个阶级的不同内容的真诚和爱情吗？人民的文艺创作者必须有对人民的真诚和爱情，这是没有争论的，我们必须反对一切虚伪和冷淡的作家和作品，但是社会主义现实主义的文艺以及历史上的一切进步的文艺对于人民的伟大意义，难道不是首先在于它们的以生活真实为基础的思想内容吗？难道为着反对文艺创作中的概念化公式化倾向，反对对古典文艺的庸俗社会学态度，就非要否认思想的意义、否认文艺的阶级性、否认历史唯物主义的文艺观而拥护唯心主义的文艺观不可吗？
    胡风在这里完全陷入个人主义和唯心主义的泥坑了。
    胡风用一切恶毒的言词来咒诅文艺创作中的概念化公式化现象，但是他是从唯心主义而不是从现实主义来反对这种现象的。革命文艺创作中的公式化概念化现象，一般地要用缺乏现实主义美学的认识和经验来解释，而不能用缺乏真诚和爱情来解释，在某种程度上，也如农民耕耘而不能得到预期的收获一般地并不由于缺乏真诚和爱情一样。至于作家不适当地使作品中的人物替自己说话，当然是不足为训的，但是这不但在初学写作的人们是通病，在古典主义和浪漫主义的作家是常事，甚至现实主义的作家也难以完全避免。高尔基在“在底层”一剧中借流浪者沙金的嘴说出了“人，这名字真光荣！”的名言和其他许多作者本人的思想，但作者自己也认为这样的话对沙金的口吻是格格不入的（见人民文学出版社版“在底层”一五五页）。难道我们可以因此就污蔑这些作家是盗用人民的名字，把人民当作傀儡等等了吗？
    胡风对文艺作品中虽然表现得不成熟但究竟是新生的革命的倾向抱着这样狂热的仇恨，还说什么“我要永远仇恨‘于旧状况那么心平气和，于较新的机运就这么疾首戚额；于已成之局那么委曲求全，于初兴之事就这么求全责备’（鲁迅）的那种臣妾底‘道德’！”这不是打自己的嘴巴吗？
    胡风认为文艺只能有一个出发点，那就是凭着“原始生命力”“主观战斗精神”“诚实”“单纯的心灵”“真诚”“卑微的感情”“意志”“赤心”等等。而且，这不但是文艺发展的基础，也是整个历史发展的基础。
    这些品质……
    凭着它们
    人民能够一面流血一面创造历史
    也凭着它们
    才承受住了那么阴森的历史压力
    胡风的理论是解放前解放后长期一贯的。他在一九四六年写的是：“人总是有所依恋也有所希望的罢，否则不能生活下去。……尽管是卑微的感情罢，人类是靠它繁衍下来的，历史是靠它发展下来的，说得夸张一点，一切轰轰烈烈的社会改革的大斗争，也是靠它生发起来的。没有生成的奴隶，被逼成的奴隶到了不能忍受不能生存的时候，也就会爆发出他们底求生的‘野性’。”（“为了明天”）在一九四八年写的是：“生活在以经济关系为基石的社会诸关系里面的人民，在重重的剥削和奴役下面担负着劳动的重负，善良地担负着，坚强地担负着，不流汗就不能活，甚至不流血也不能活，但却‘脚踏实地’地站在地球上面流着汗流着血地担负了下来。这伟大的精神就是世界底脊梁。”（“论现实主义的路”）到了一九五二年写的是：“在长期的阶级压迫和民族屈辱下面，……这些宝贵的品质，在历史的风霜中间越过越坚强，是永远长生，而且不断成长的。凭着这些，劳动人民在被束缚的条件下面创造了历史，替我们创造了这么伟大的民族传统；凭着这些，劳动人民改变了历史局面，而且要创造出一部全新历史的。这个爱，这个恨，这个意志，我们把它们叫做历史的生力素，或者简单地叫做热情。”（“和新人物在一起”）
    是呵！很“简单”！说来话去，其实并不难懂，只是说社会变革、历史发展的根本的动力就是人的求生存的欲望，就是人要繁殖子孙的要求，就是人的动物性的本能。用一度追随胡风的舒芜的比较玄妙的话来说，就是所谓“生生不已的天心”，用胡风的比较干脆的话来说，就是“求生的野性”。这种崇拜“本能”，鼓吹不可捉摸的“热情”“生力素”等等的资产阶级唯心史观，即使再披挂上“社会经济关系”“阶级压迫”等等漂亮的字眼，也无所掩其原形了。也许胡风并不是像他在攻击别人时所诬指的那样要“完全取消文艺运动，把它送给蒋介石或者和蒋介石共同占有”，但“至少至少”是要把“历史的道路”“未来的道路”一并送给资产阶级唯心主义者，或者和资产阶级唯心主义者“共同占有”。
    马克思主义者对历史的看法和胡风不同。马克思主义者认为，决定社会历史发展的主要力量并不是人们的主观精神。斯大林在“辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义”中告诉我们：“研究社会历史规律的关键，并不是要到人们底头脑中，到社会底观点和思想中去探求，而是要到社会在每一个历史时期所采取的生产方式中，即要到社会底经济中去探求。”
    可是我们的胡风先生不是还要“对历史对党负责”，“加强和人民的结合”吗？在人民面前，这件“马克思主义”的外衣还是不能不披呵！不披上的话，唯心主义又怎么能够“达到”马克思主义呢？最后一着，那只有变戏法，让“这个感觉”、“这种感情”、这个“热情”、这个“野性”、这个“世界底脊梁”的“伟大的精神”，也就是这个叫做“历史的生力素”的东西变一下吧：
    成长了起来
    壮大了起来
    变成了集体主义的生力素
    使中国历史出现了一个新的时期——
    原来，“你们”的集体主义也就是“我们”的唯心主义。你说我没有阶级观点吗？那我就变给你看，加上一顶“集体主义”帽子。变了没有呢？真所谓“以不变应万变”“虽然受过波折但却终于保持了这一点情操经验”（胡风在这首长诗的跋文中的话），还是这个“生力素”，还是这个“伟大的精神”，还是我胡风的唯心史观！
    唯心的历史观当然产生唯心的艺术观。我们在前面已经看到，胡风是用“真诚”而不是现实生活来作文艺创作和文艺批评的基础的，而这正是同马克思主义或现实主义完全无关的唯心主义思想。胡风的这种唯心主义文艺观也是长期一贯的。胡风在解放前发表的“论现实主义的路”中，反复强调作家的“真诚”的重要性，强调到这是唯一的准则的地步。后来胡风曾经屡次辩解说是由于环境不自由，不能不用“奴隶的语言”来说话之故。可是难道“时间开始了！”所用的也是“奴隶的语言”吗？同样，在一九五○年写的论文“祝福祖国，祝福人民！”中，胡风在指导一个青年作家写作时，还是说：“在我们伟大的时代，在我们伟大的祖国，只要是真诚的心，只要是从血肉的生活感受出发，随时随地都会听得见美好动人的真诚的心声……”可见，胡风是坚持了要用这种资产阶级也能够同意的超阶级的道德标准来作为文艺创作的标准的，他是无法用解放前的写作条件云云来作掩饰的。他在“关于几个理论性问题的说明材料”中，一不做二不休，索性在他的超阶级的“真诚”的概念和共产主义党性的概念之间划起等号来。他说：“这样的忠诚和谦虚就正是我们在这个领域（按指文艺领域）上所要求的党性。”又说：“一个作家，如果是真诚的作家，如果是有党性（这在我们，和‘艺术良心’是同义语的）作家，他只能够和他身上能有的基础相应的对象结合，这个结合才是真诚的，对象才能够透过他的智慧，他的心，成为种子，被创造成真实的感动人的艺术品。”胡风在几十万字的报告里，拳打脚踢，画符念咒，躲躲闪闪，曲曲折折，玩弄词句的结果是什么呢？无非是这样：真诚就是党性，党性也就是艺术良心！
    无非是这样，九九归源：党性等于真诚和良心，革命世界观等于“人格力量”，阶级性等于超阶级性，唯物主义等于唯心主义……
    法捷耶夫在第二次全苏作家代表大会上谈到波密朗采夫所谓“文学中的真诚性”的理论时说，真正的文学不会不是真诚的和正直的，但是提出“真诚”问题来的批评家，却是“希望伟大的苏联文学放弃鼓舞着它的那些共产主义思想，而成为异己思想的传导者”。这些话难道不是同样适用于胡风吗？
    共产主义党性对于企图为工农兵服务、为总路线服务的作家，不论是党员还是非党员，都是最可宝贵的。党性不但不是束缚他们思想感情的“棍子”“刀子”，而是给他们以判别真伪，评价善恶，区分本质和非本质、典型和非典型的东西的力量，是使他们的作品获得真正价值的要素。党性能够给他们以真正的自由，自由地为教育新的一代而创作！
    可是胡风的主观主义的创作方法能给作家以什么呢？胡风自己的创作实践、他的长诗就是答案之一。他捧住了自己的“党性”——“真诚”，认为只要忠于自我，忠于他自己的主观，认为只要加强“主观战斗精神”，“自我扩张”，“解剖自己”，“克服着本身底二重人格”，不需要深入群众、研究生活，就能够写好作品。可是结果怎样呢？结果是歪曲了人民和历史，臆造了人物典型，把自己的个人主义、唯心主义的黑漆涂抹到对象上去。胡风的创作实践充分证明了他的文艺理论的破产！
    胡风曾经大叫大嚷地说，“几年以来，抒情诗被压得不能透气了。”看看目前的出版物，抒情诗却还是活跃着的。倒是胡风自己的理论却在危害着抒情诗，破坏着诗的民族的和世界的传统，使诗彻底地散文化、论文化、演说化、口号化。难道把“劳动人民万岁！无产阶级万岁！国际主义万岁！全人类解放万岁！”或“人民不朽！爱不朽！劳动不朽！创造不朽！真理不朽！祖国不朽！地球不朽！群星不朽！大宇宙不朽！”这样的句子分行写了，每行中间加些符号，再用黑体印出，或者把许多诗行不知依据什么标准分得忽长忽短，排得或高或低，就能产生诗的效果么？否认诗的一定的内容和一定的形式（诗的形式给最大多数读者一种共同的明了的节奏感，这种节奏感是马雅可夫斯基所严格尊重的，因此他的诗都有严整的格律，并且很多诗都有韵，只是中国的有些自称为他的信徒的人们不知道或不承认吧了），究竟是使诗繁荣还是萎缩，是诗深入人民还是脱离人民呢？胡风的诗不但整个形式是脱离人民的，而且许多诗节和诗句也显出极大的做作，有时简直费解。例如：
    它们用火炭烘你的胸膛
    它们用火箸烘你的太阳穴
    魔火这样地向你烧了进去
    你心里的仇恨又愈烧愈旺
            烧成了通红的红铁
    一天一夜的猛烈的燃烧
    终于（！！！）
    你的血液烧开了！
    你的神经烧断了！
    你的心脏烧炸了！
    作者的唯心主义的混乱的表现方法，使读者连究竟是反动派害死了小林，还是牺牲者自己的仇恨烧死自己都很难明白。至于像“眼皮上的那个小疤也好像沉醉地唱着爱情的曲子”，“他紧抱了毛泽东的血温”，“在欢跃的血球大海上面”一类句子，就更是胡风的不顾读者只顾自己的修辞的特点了。这样的创作实践也正证明了他的文艺理论的破产！
