To meet the needs of national construction, China's building materials industry has successfully trial-produced nine new products since 1954. Soviet experts provided assistance in the trial production of these new products.

In the cement field, four new products have been successfully trial-produced: high-alumina cement, white cement, clinker-free cement, and plugging cement. The setting time of high-alumina cement is more than eight times faster than that of ordinary cement, meeting the needs of the national defense industry and various projects requiring quick-setting cement. White cement is particularly suitable for decorative projects, such as artificial marble. The white cement trial-produced last year was supplied for the construction needs of the Soviet Exhibition Center. Clinker-free cement was successfully trial-produced by the building materials industry department in cooperation with Anshan Iron and Steel. Its compressive strength can meet the requirements of ordinary cement. The equipment and technical conditions required for manufacturing this cement are relatively simple. If it can be manufactured in large quantities and used universally, it can greatly reduce production costs and save construction expenses. Plugging cement is one of the important building materials in the petroleum industry. The products trial-produced last year were used in petroleum industry construction, and their quality and effect were very good.

The new products also include tempered glass, which is particularly strong and mainly used in automobiles and ships; large corrugated asbestos tiles, which can save wood or iron beams used in building houses and reduce construction costs; and cement pipes suitable for water supply lines, which are highly pressure-resistant and can replace steel water pipes. In addition, the ceramics factory has also successfully trial-produced women's bidets and filter plates.

Currently, these new products have all been put into production.

    建筑材料工业制成九种新产品
    我国建筑材料工业为适应国家建设的需要，从一九五四年以来已试制成功九种新产品。在新产品试制工作中得到了苏联专家的帮助。
    在水泥方面试制成功的有四种新产品：高铝水泥、白色水泥、无熟料水泥和堵塞水泥。高铝水泥的凝结时间比普通水泥加快八倍多，适应了国防工业以及各种需要快凝水泥工程的需要；白色水泥特别适用于装饰工程，如人造大理石等，去年试制的白色水泥即供应了苏联展览馆的建筑需要；无熟料水泥是建筑材料工业部门和鞍钢合作试制成功的，它的耐压强度能够达到普通水泥的要求，制造这种水泥所需设备及技术条件都比较简单，如能大量制造和普遍使用，就可以大大降低生产成本和节省建筑费用；堵塞水泥是石油工业中重要的建筑材料之一，去年试制的产品用在石油工业建筑上，它的质量和效果都很好。
    新产品中还有钢化玻璃，这种玻璃特别结实，主要用在汽车和轮船上；还有大波石绵瓦，用这种瓦可节省建筑房屋用的木梁或铁梁，能降低建筑费用；还有适于上水道用的水泥管，这种水泥管耐压高，可以代替钢铁水管。此外，陶瓷厂还试制成功了女用洗涤器和泸器盘。
    目前，这些新产品都已投入生产。
