A New Method for Preserving Railroad Ties
　　Lü Xijiu
The Railway Research Institute of the Ministry of Railways, drawing on advanced Soviet experience, has developed a water-soluble preservative slurry coating method for the preservative treatment of railroad ties.
　　Railways use a large number of railroad ties every year. Generally, untreated railroad ties can only be used for an average of five years, and some cannot be used again after only one year. Therefore, the railway has become one of the departments that uses the most wood. China's wood resources are limited. How to extend the service life of railroad ties and save wood has always been a concern.
　　On Soviet railways, all railroad ties are treated with preservatives, which can extend their service life by two to ten times. Due to the limited production capacity of railroad tie preservation plants and the shortage of oil-based preservatives in China, it is currently impossible to use preservative-treated railroad ties on a large scale. The water-soluble preservative slurry coating method successfully tested by the Railway Research Institute provides a new method for railroad tie preservation. The advantages of this method are: first, it does not require complicated equipment, and preservative treatment can be carried out in maintenance work areas along the railway; second, the main preservative, sodium fluoride, is made from fluorite, which is abundant in Shandong, Zhejiang and other provinces of China, ensuring the supply of raw materials; third, it has strong preservative ability, and the processed wood is similar to oil-based preservatives.
　　The use of water-soluble preservative slurry coating method to treat railroad ties has great economic value. Assuming that 5 million railroad ties are treated with this method each year, at least 15 million railroad ties can be saved in future allocations. If each railroad tie is calculated at 100,000 yuan, 1.5 trillion yuan can be saved; deducting the processing cost of approximately 30,000 yuan per railroad tie, at least 1 trillion yuan can be saved.
　　The Ministry of Railways has adopted this new method of railroad tie preservation and has convened on-site technicians and cadres to attend training courses at the Railway Research Institute to learn and prepare for promotion.

    枕木防腐的新方法
    吕锡九
    铁道部铁道研究所吸取苏联先进经验，研究了一种水溶性防腐剂浆膏涂抹法，来进行枕木的防腐处理。
    铁路上每年要使用大量枕木，一般没有经过防腐处理的枕木，平均只能用五年，有的甚至只用了一年就不能再用了，因而铁路成为使用木材最多的部门之一。我国的木材资源有限，如何延长枕木的使用寿命，节约木材，一直是大家关心的问题。
    苏联铁路上一律都用经过防腐处理的枕木，使用寿命可延长两倍至十倍。我国铁路因受到枕木防腐厂的生产能力和油质防腐剂不足的限制，目前还不能大量使用防腐枕木。铁道研究所试验成功的水溶性防腐剂浆膏涂抹法为枕木防腐提供了一种新的方法。这种方法的优点是：第一、不需要复杂的设备，在铁路沿线的养护工区里就可以进行防腐处理；第二、主要防腐剂氟化钠是用我国山东、浙江等省盛产的萤石制造的，原料供应有保证；第三、防腐能力较强，加工成木与油质防腐相仿。
    采用水溶性防腐剂浆膏涂抹法处理枕木，有很大的经济价值。假定每年用这个方法处理枕木五百万根，至少可节省以后调用的枕木一千五百万根。每根以十万元计算，就可以节约一万五千亿元；扣除加工成木每根约三万元，至少也可以节约一万亿元。
    铁道部已采纳了这个枕木防腐的新方法，召集了现场的技术工人和干部到铁道研究所举办的学习班来学习，准备推广。
