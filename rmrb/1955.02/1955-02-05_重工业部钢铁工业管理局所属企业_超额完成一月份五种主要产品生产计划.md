    Enterprises Under the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry
    Overfulfill January Production Plans for Five Major Products
   [Our Newspaper] Enterprises under the Iron and Steel Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry overfulfilled the January production plans for five major products this year. Iron ore fulfilled 101% of the plan, pig iron 100.9%, steel 102.1%, steel products 102.9%, and metallurgical coke 101%.
    In the first month of this year, employees of various enterprises persevered in their hard work and further studied advanced Soviet experiences, achieving new successes. For example, the Tianjin Steel Plant launched rapid steelmaking in open-hearth furnaces, accelerating the melting of the charge, which shortened the average smelting time by twelve minutes compared to the plan. Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, Tianjin Steel Plant, Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1, and other units promoted the advanced Soviet experience of "thick layer burning and patching" furnace bottoms, which not only improved the quality of furnace bottom burning and patching but also shortened the hot repair time. The productivity of the open-hearth furnaces and converters at Shanghai Steel Plant No. 1 was further enhanced due to the adoption of new technical measures. The steel output per furnace of the plant's open-hearth furnaces and converters increased by 7.1% and 15.2% respectively compared to December last year. The converters also set a new record of 136 heats per day. In terms of ironmaking, the blast furnaces at Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant operated smoothly, basically completing the daily work plan, with a total overproduction of 3,200 tons of pig iron for the entire month. The No. 5 blast furnace at Ma'anshan Iron Plant also set a new daily production record. In terms of steel rolling, the steel rolling mills of various plants continued to promote the use of phenolic resin bearings, reducing rolling current and power consumption per unit time. In terms of coking, Benxi Iron and Steel Company increased its output by 10.9% compared to December 1954 due to the adoption of new coal blending ratios and the addition of diesel fuel to the blended coal.

    超额完成一月份五种主要产品生产计划
   【本报讯】重工业部钢铁工业管理局所属企业，超额完成了今年一月份五种主要产品的生产计划。铁矿石完成计划百分之一○一，生铁为一○○·九，钢为一○二·一，钢材为一○二·九，冶金焦为一○一。
    各企业职工在今年第一个月份里坚持不懈地努力工作，并进一步学习了苏联先进经验，取得了新的成就。如天津钢厂开展平炉快速炼钢，加速炉料的熔化，使平均熔炼时间较计划缩短十二分钟。太原钢铁厂，天津钢厂，上海钢铁一厂等单位，都推行了苏联“厚层烧补”炉底的先进经验，不但提高了炉底烧补的质量，也缩短了热修时间，上海钢铁一厂的平炉和转炉由于采用了新的技术措施，生产力获得进一步发挥，该厂平炉和转炉每炉产钢量比去年十二月份分别提高百分之七点一和百分之十五点二，转炉并创造日炼一百三十六炉的新纪录。在炼铁方面，石景山钢铁厂高炉炉况顺行，基本上作到按日完成作业计划，全月共超产三千二百吨生铁。马鞍山铁厂五号高炉也创造了日产新纪录。在轧钢方面，各厂轧钢机继续推广使用了胶木轴瓦，降低了轧钢电流和单位时间的耗电量。炼焦方面，本溪钢铁公司由于采用新配煤比和在配煤内加柴油的措施，产量比一九五四年十二月份提高百分之十点九。
