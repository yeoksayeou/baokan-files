The highway transportation departments of Beijing and Hebei Province must correct the bad practice of mutual competition.
Since the winter of last year, some strange phenomena have appeared on some highways between Beijing and Hebei Province:
    Reader Zhang Qun wrote to say that he could not buy a direct bus ticket from Beijing to Tangshan at several bus stations in Beijing; while other readers wrote to express their surprise at seeing a bus from Tangshan Transportation Company driving empty from Beijing back to Tangshan every day.
    Readers Su Jiejun and four others wrote to reflect that there was already a bus service between Beijing and Zunhua operated by the Beijing Automobile Transportation Company, and there were not many passengers to begin with. Recently, the Tangshan Transportation Company added another bus; as a result, when leaving the Zunhua station set up by the Tangshan Company, the Beijing Company's bus was empty, while when driving from Beijing, the Tangshan Company's bus had no passengers.
    Reader Shao Jun wrote to accuse that the highway between Beijing and Xiongxian was repaired long ago after the rainy season, why haven't buses been running? Reader Chen Desheng wrote that the vehicles of the private car dealership designated by the Beijing Automobile Transportation Company to run this route have long been ready, and are now worried about being idle for a long time.
    Why are these strange phenomena occurring? The Beijing Automobile Transportation Company said it was the fault of the Tangshan and Baoding Transportation Companies of Hebei Province, while these two companies said it was the fault of the Beijing Company – everyone said they had no responsibility at all.
    To find out who is responsible, it is helpful to listen to the opinions of both sides.
    Why can't the direct bus between Beijing and Tangshan find passengers, and passengers can't get on the bus? The Beijing Company said: This bus route started operating in the winter of 1953, and was suspended during the rainy season. Because there were few passengers, it was not resumed later; the Tangshan Company disregarded the passenger situation and did not consult with us before starting the bus service on its own. The Tangshan Company said: We started the bus service based on the past traffic agreement and also according to the requirements of passengers; it was the Beijing Company that violated the agreement and did not provide the necessary assistance to our vehicles going to Beijing.
    Why are empty buses running back and forth on the Beijing-Zunhua line? The Beijing Company said: Our buses have always been running on this line, and the Tangshan Company should not have started the bus service without authorization. The Tangshan Company said: There used to be regulations stating that the buses of the two companies could run on this line, and it is in accordance with the regulations for us to run a bus every other day during the peak season; the blame lies with the Beijing Company for insisting on allowing only their own buses to run.
    Why are there vehicles on the Beijing-Xiongxian line but they cannot run? The Beijing Company said: We let the commercial vehicles that used to run this route resume operation in early December, but they were repeatedly blocked at the Gaobeidian station of the Baoding Company for several days, and the stations set up by the Baoding Company did not sell tickets, so we had to stop the vehicles. The Baoding Company said: The Gaobeidian station blocked the vehicles because the Beijing Company did not contact us before starting the bus service, and this practice has been corrected; the reason for stopping the vehicles is that we proposed that the buses of the two companies should run on this line, but the Beijing Company was unwilling to negotiate with us.
    Although these companies have put forward many reasons to accuse each other of being wrong and prove their own correctness; the facts are very clear, these companies are being petty and competing with each other.
    Originally, winter is the peak season for highway transportation, and these highways are in good condition, so it is of course very profitable to operate transportation on these highways in winter, so several companies competed. This is why the problem did not occur during the rainy season, and why no one wants to operate on some other highways with poor conditions (such as the Zunhua to Xifengkou highway, which is adjacent to the Beijing-Zunhua line).
    Since it is competition, of course, one cannot take care of the other party – although the two sides are called "brother companies." Therefore, when opinions differ, they are not resolved through consultation, but are done first. The station set up by this company does not sell tickets for the vehicles of that company. Even when the managers of the Beijing and Baoding companies exchanged opinions over the long-distance telephone after the problem occurred, there was a scene of slamming the handset and breaking up.
    The result of the competition is painful: the country has suffered losses, passengers feel inconvenience, and the companies themselves have also suffered disadvantages. Originally, competition is the relationship between capitalist enterprises, and it is incompatible with the relationship that should exist between brother enterprises belonging to the state.
    The Hebei Provincial Department of Transportation and the Beijing Municipal Transportation Administration knew about these situations a long time ago, but did not take the necessary measures in time; after inspection by the Highway Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, it was first decided to open the Beijing-Xiongxian line and allow the Tangshan Company's vehicles to sell tickets at the Beijing bus station, and is studying the division of business scope in the future. However, even at this time, readers' letters still reflected that some staff members of the Beijing Qianmen Bus Station were promoting to passengers that the Tangshan Company's vehicles were not good, saying "Let them run empty a few times, and the vehicles will not come."
    It is worth noting that such competition not only occurs in automobile transportation, but also in horse-drawn carriage transportation. The transportation units of Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality jointly undertake the transportation of bricks, tiles, sand and stones in the suburbs of Beijing and across provinces and municipalities, in order to supply the needs of the capital's basic construction. Both sides shouted slogans such as "guaranteeing" or "supporting" the capital's construction, but in reality, they were each calculating their own small abacus: to win more sources of goods for the private horse-drawn carriages managed by their own unit, so that they could also extract more service fees. As a result, there has been a phenomenon of "pushing responsibility when busy, and competing for business during the off-season," and even incidents of withholding vehicles have occurred.
    This unprincipled competition between state transportation enterprises must be stopped. We must thoroughly examine and correct the capitalist business ideology of localism and disregard for the overall situation.

### 北京市和河北省公路运输部门必须纠正互相竞争的恶劣作法

    北京市和河北省公路运输部门必须纠正互相竞争的恶劣作法
    从去年冬季开始，北京市和河北省之间的某些公路上，出现了一些令人奇怪的现象：
    读者张群来信诉述他在北京市几个汽车站都买不到北京到唐山的直达客车的车票；而另外几个读者来信，为每天看到唐山运输公司的一辆客车从北京空着开回唐山去而感到惊异。
    苏捷俊等五位读者来信反映，北京和遵化间原有北京市汽车运输公司的班车，乘客本来就不多，最近唐山运输公司又发了一班车；于是，离开唐山公司所设的遵化站时，北京公司的车是空着的，而从北京开车时，唐山公司的车就没有客人。
    读者少俊来信指责，北京和雄县间的公路在雨季后早就修复了，为什么汽车一直不通？读者陈德盛却来信说，由北京市汽车运输公司指定跑这条路的私营车行的车辆早就准备好了，现在正为长期窝工而发愁。
    为什么会出现这些奇怪的现象呢？北京市汽车运输公司说是河北省唐山、保定两个运输公司的错误，而这两个公司又说是北京公司的过失——谁都说自己丝毫没有责任。
    要弄清责任，听一下双方的意见是有好处的。
    为什么京唐直达客车会汽车找不到乘客、乘客搭不上汽车呢？北京公司说：这班车在一九五三年冬季开始通行，到雨季停驶了，因为客源少，后来就没有恢复；是唐山公司不顾客源情况，并且没有和我们商量好，就自行发了车。唐山公司则说：我们发车是根据过去的通车协议，也是根据旅客的要求；是北京公司违反协议，而且对我们去北京的车辆不给以应有的协助。
    为什么京遵线上的空车来回不绝呢？北京公司说：这条线上一直是我们的车在走，唐山公司不该擅自发车。唐山公司则说：过去曾有规定说这条线上两个公司的车可以互通，我们在旺季隔天发一次车是合乎规定的；要怪北京公司坚持只让独家的车行走。
    为什么京雄线上有车而不能通行呢？北京公司说：我们在十二月初就让过去跑这条路的商车恢复行驶，但是接连几天在保定公司的高碑店站都受到阻拦，保定公司所设各站还不给卖票，只好停车了。保定公司说：高碑店站阻拦车辆是因为北京公司发车前没有和我们联系，这种做法也已经纠正了；停车的原因是我们提出这条线上由两个公司互通车辆，而北京公司不愿和我们协商。
    尽管这几个公司提出了很多理由来指责对方的不是，证明自己的正确；但是事实毕竟很明白了，是这几个公司在互相闹意气，互相竞争。
    原来，冬季是公路运输的旺季，这几条公路是条件较好的公路，冬季在这几条公路上经营运输当然是很有利的，于是几个公司就竞争起来了。这就是为什么问题不在雨季发生的原因，也就是为什么另外一些条件不好的公路（像紧接着京遵线的遵化到喜峰口的公路）谁也不去经营的原因。
    既然是竞争，当然就不能顾到对方——虽然双方是以“兄弟公司”相称的。于是，意见不一致了，不是协商解决，而是做了再说。这个公司所设的车站不给那个公司的车代卖车票。甚至当问题发生后，北京、保定两个公司的经理在用长途电话交换意见时，还出现了摔耳机而散的场面。
    竞争的结果是令人痛心的：国家受到了损失，旅客感到了不便，而几个公司本身得到的也是不利。本来，竞争是资本主义企业之间的关系，和同属国家的兄弟企业之间应有的关系是不能相容的。
    河北省交通厅和北京市运输管理局很早就知道了这些情况，但是并没有及时采取应有的措施；交通部公路总局检查以后，先决定在京雄线通车和让唐山公司的车在北京的汽车站卖票，并正在研究今后经营范围的划分问题。但是，就在这个时候，读者来信中还反映了北京前门汽车站有的职员在向旅客宣传唐山公司车辆不好，说是“让他们空驶几次，车就不来了”。
    值得注意的是，这样的竞争，不仅出现在汽车运输中，在马车运输工作中也有类似现象。河北省和北京市两个运输单位共同负担着北京郊区和省、市跨区的砖瓦砂石运输工作，以供应首都基本建设的需要。双方口头上高喊着“保证”或“支援”首都建设，但实际上却各自打着自己的小算盘：为本单位管理下的私营马车多争些货源，自己也可以多抽取一些服务费。于是，发生了“忙时推责任，冬闲争业务”的现象，甚至还曾出现过扣车的事件。
    必须制止国家运输企业之间这种无原则的竞争。必须彻底检查和纠正本位主义、不顾整体的资本主义经营思想。
