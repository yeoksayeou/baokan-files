    The Jingjiang Dike in Hubei Province safeguarded the lives and property of three million people in the Jianghan Plain area during last year's flood control efforts, and protected more than eight million mu of farmland from flood damage.
    In order to further consolidate the dike and lay the foundation for overcoming floods in this year's flood season, the Jingjiang Dike began a comprehensive dike reinforcement project in December last year. The tens of thousands of migrant workers participating in the dike repair have completed 5.2 million cubic meters of earthwork and 156,000 cubic meters of stonework, equivalent to 70 percent of the total dike project in the five years since liberation. All projects are expected to be completed by the end of March this year. Han Xuezhang (Publicity Department of the Ministry of Water Resources) (with pictures)

    荆江大堤的岁修工程
    湖北省荆江大堤在去年防汛斗争中保障了江汉平原一带三百万人民生命财产的安全，使得八百多万亩良田免受洪水的灾害。
    为了进一步巩固堤防，给今年汛期打下战胜洪水的基础，荆江大堤从去年十二月份开始进行全面的堤防加固工程。参加修堤的数万民工，共做土工五百二十万公方，石工十五万六千公方，相当于解放后五年来大堤工程总和的百分之七十。全部工程争取在今年三月底完成。  韩学章摄（水利部宣传处稿）（附图片）
