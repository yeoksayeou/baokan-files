Response to Criticism and Suggestions

    Further Improve Product Quality
    Su Chen, Director of the Local State-Owned Huasheng Rubber Factory in Rehe Province, writes: The readers' criticism of the poor quality of our factory's "Su Xin" brand sneakers on January 2nd is correct. Our factory began production in April 1953. Due to weak technical capabilities at the time, coupled with capitalist thinking on the part of the leadership, the quality of our "Su Xin" brand sneakers was indeed poor, causing the state to suffer losses of more than 500 million yuan and creating a bad influence among the masses.

    Through education from this incident, and under the supervision and assistance of higher-level leading organs, our factory conducted a major quality inspection, criticized the capitalist thinking of the leadership, sent technical personnel to fraternal factories to learn, and carried out a series of improvements in production within the factory. Currently, the quality of the "Xin Xin" brand sneakers produced has reached the national standards. However, we will never be complacent because of this and are determined to continue to work hard to improve our work and improve product quality in order to reverse the negative impact of the past.

专栏：批评建议的反应

    进一步提高产品质量
    热河省地方国营华胜橡胶厂厂长苏臣来信：一月二日读者对我厂“苏新牌”球鞋质量低劣的批评是正确的。我厂在一九五三年四月开始生产，由于当时技术力量薄弱，加上领导方面有着资本主义思想，因此产品“苏新牌”球鞋质量低劣，使国家遭受五亿多元的损失，并在群众中造成了恶劣的影响。
    经过这个事件的教育，并在上级领导机关的督促帮助下，我厂进行了质量大检查，批判了领导方面的资本主义思想，派技术人员到兄弟厂去学习，并在厂里对生产进行了一系列的改进。目前，所产的“新新牌”球鞋质量已达到了国家规定的标准。但是，我们绝不因而自满，决心继续努力改进工作，提高产品质量，以挽回过去的不良影响。
