To the Editor:

The labor organization at the Fushun Drilling Company is unreasonable, and the situation of wasted manpower is extremely serious. In the first half of 1954, the average monthly surplus of technical personnel and staff was more than 100, and the average monthly surplus of workers was more than 80. This resulted in the state expending more than 600 million yuan in half a year. The Drilling Company has reported the situation of wasted manpower to its superior leadership – the Northeast Coalfield First Geological Exploration Bureau – but the problem has not been resolved.

Due to the unreasonable labor organization, the company suffers from a serious lack of responsibility in work and lax labor discipline. It is understood that in the company's guard room, two or three staff members often "hang around doing nothing," some staff members in the offices often read books and newspapers during work hours or have nothing to do; individual personnel even go fishing in the puddles during work hours. Under such circumstances, the company's work efficiency is not high, but costs have increased significantly.

I believe that the relevant superior leadership should quickly help the Fushun Drilling Company improve its labor organization in order to effectively improve work.

    抚顺钻探公司劳动组织不合理编辑同志：
    抚顺钻探公司劳动组织不合理，人员窝工浪费情况极为严重。在一九五四年上半年，超定员配备的技术人员和职员平均每月有一百多人，超定员配备的工人平均每月有八十多人。这样，在半年中，国家就多支出了六亿多元。钻探公司曾把人员窝工浪费的情况向上级领导机关——东北煤田第一地质勘探局反映，但是问题一直没有得到解决。由于劳动组织不合理，公司里工作无人负责和劳动纪律松懈的现象十分严重。据了解，在公司的守卫室里经常有三两个职员“泡蘑菇”，科室的部分职员在工作时间经常看书看报，或无事可做；个别人员甚至在工作时间跑到水泡子去钓鱼。在这种情况下，这个公司的工作效率不高，成本却大量增高。我认为有关上级领导机关应该迅速帮助抚顺钻探公司改善劳动组织，以便有效地提高工作。     叶阔
