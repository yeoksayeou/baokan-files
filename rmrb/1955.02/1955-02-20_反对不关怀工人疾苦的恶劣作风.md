    To the Editor:
    An incident occurred in the No. 2 Mine of the state-owned Yangquan Mining Bureau where the leadership's lack of concern for workers' suffering resulted in the poverty-stricken and sick worker Niu Dashun dying.
    Niu Dashun was a worker in the 14th group of the No. 2 Mine's repair team. Last May, he contracted gastritis and took sick leave to recuperate, returning to work on September 21st. On the third day back at work, Niu Dashun, along with central group leader Li Yuying, technician Wu Wende, and others, were doing repair work (building a wall) underground when he was injured by coal. He wanted to register a work-related injury, but Li Yuying refused in order to conceal the work-related accident; he also requested sick leave, but Li Yuying still refused. At that time, Dr. Yu of the clinic also determined that Niu Dashun had internal injuries to his waist and head. However, the administrative and trade union leaders of the No. 2 Mine listened only to Li Yuying's side of the story and treated Niu Dashun's absence after September 24th as absenteeism.
    After that, Niu Dashun kept requesting that his work-related injury be handled correctly. Later, after a doctor's certificate was provided, the mine finally allowed Niu Dashun to take sick leave for treatment starting October 12th. However, on October 18th, the mine suddenly stopped Niu Dashun's work.
    Why was this? It turned out that Niu Dashun's wife brought five children to the mine on September 20th, but because they could not get housing from the administrative section, the whole family lived in an empty stone kiln on the mine premises. On September 23rd, the mine found out and drove the family of seven out. Niu Dashun stayed in the open field for one night, and fearing that the children would be eaten by wolves, he asked the administrative section for housing again, but to no avail. He then had to find another empty kiln to settle down. In this way, the mine stopped Niu Dashun's work under the pretext of "strict factory and mine regulations."
    After receiving this treatment, Niu Dashun's family life became impossible. He repeatedly asked the mine to restore his work, but to no avail. He then filed a complaint with the Yangquan City Labor Bureau and other units. The Labor Bureau sent letters to the No. 2 Mine's wage section and inspection section three times. The inspection section completely ignored the letter from the Labor Bureau; the wage section even discussed having the comrades' trial committee try Niu Dashun or demoting him to a temporary worker. Fortunately, the Labor Bureau later sent someone to handle the matter, and Niu Dashun resumed his work on November 8th.
    During this period, Niu Dashun did not receive any wages for thirty-nine days. According to workers and neighbors, his whole family lived on tofu dregs every day, which was very difficult. Guan Chengde, the secretary of the workshop Party branch, discovered this situation and asked the trade union to find a way to provide relief, but the trade union did not intervene. Shortly after Niu Dashun resumed work, he fell ill on November 25th and died on December 2nd after ineffective treatment.
    Although Niu Dashun's death was due to illness, it was inseparable from the fact that some leading cadres of the No. 2 Mine had lost their basic class feelings and had no sympathy for the difficulties of their worker brothers. After the Yangquan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China discovered this problem, it has sent a working group to conduct an investigation. However, He Wusheng, chairman of the No. 2 Mine Trade Union, still believes that "the Municipal Committee is making a fuss and listening to only one side of the story;" and said, "The Municipal Committee can do the aftermath of Niu Dashun's death, we have no way."
    In socialist enterprises, such a phenomenon of lacking class feelings and not caring about the suffering of workers is absolutely not allowed to continue. The leadership of the Yangquan Mining Bureau should seriously handle this incident.

    Editor's Note: The Niu Dashun death incident exposes the extremely serious bourgeois ideological work style of certain leading cadres of the No. 2 Mine of the Yangquan Mining Bureau. They disregard the suffering of the worker masses, and they adopt the bad attitude of capitalists in the old society toward workers to handle the reasonable demands of the worker masses. These phenomena are intolerable. The Yangquan Mining Bureau must seriously and conscientiously handle this incident in order to restore the adverse political impact caused by it.
    It is worth noting that the phenomenon of concealing work-related injuries exposed in the Niu Dashun incident is also quite common in certain mines under the Yangquan Mining Bureau. For example, in the No. 4 Mine, there were 32 cases of concealed work-related injuries from October to early December last year. Qiu Taoqi (a member of the Communist Youth League), a worker in the "Eleventh" coal mining team in the No. 1 mining area of the No. 4 Mine, injured his right hand at work on October 26th. Because the heads of the coal mining team and the production group did not allow him to register a work-related injury, he had to work with the injury. By the time the injury had become very serious, he went to the Mining Bureau Hospital for treatment, and the examination revealed that his right hand was fractured, and the treatment was already too late. Similar phenomena also exist in the No. 3 Mine. The direct reason for this phenomenon is that some leading comrades in the mines, as well as some cadres in the groups and workshops, in order to receive commendations and bonuses for safe production, are unwilling to report work-related accidents. Some leading cadres in the mines, although they know the situation of work-related accidents, do not investigate and correct them. This erroneous practice not only creates false phenomena in safety work but also prevents workers who are injured at work from receiving the treatment they deserve, increasing their suffering and even damaging their health. It is suggested that the Yangquan Mining Bureau, through the handling of the Niu Dashun incident, thoroughly examine the problem of concealing work-related accidents and disregarding workers' suffering, and take effective measures to correct it.

### 反对不关怀工人疾苦的恶劣作风

    反对不关怀工人疾苦的恶劣作风编辑同志：
    国营阳泉矿务局二矿发生了一件领导方面不关心工人疾苦，而使工人牛大顺贫病致死的事件。
    牛大顺是二矿修护队十四组的工人。去年五月，他得了胃炎，请假休养，到九月二十一日才恢复上班。上班后第三天，牛大顺同中心组长李玉英、技术员吴文德等人在坑下做修护工作（垒墙）时，被煤打伤了。他要挂工伤，李玉英为了隐瞒工伤事故，竟不同意；他又要求请病假休息，李玉英还是不准。当时，医务所余大夫也判明牛大顺腰部和头部受内伤。但是二矿的行政、工会领导方面偏听李玉英一面之词，把牛大顺在九月二十四日以后的缺勤当作旷工处理。
    在这以后，牛大顺一直要求正确处理他的工伤问题。后来经过医生证明，矿方才允许牛大顺从十月十二日起请病假看病。但是，到十月十八日，矿方又忽然停止牛大顺的工作了。
    这是为什么呢？原来牛大顺爱人在九月二十日带了五个小孩来到矿里，因为向行政科要不到房子，一家人就住到矿上一个空石窑子里。九月二十三日，矿方知道了，把他们一家七口赶了出去。牛大顺在野外住了一夜，他怕小孩在野外被狼吃掉，又向行政科要房子，没有结果，于是只得又找了一个空窑子安身。这样，矿方就以“严格厂矿制度”为理由，停止了牛大顺的工作。
    牛大顺遭到这种待遇以后，家庭生活没法过，多次向矿方要求恢复工作也没有效果，就向阳泉市劳动局等单位提出申诉。劳动局三次给二矿工薪科和检查科去信。检查科接到劳动局的信后，根本没有理睬；工薪科居然还研究要让同志审判会审判牛大顺，或把牛大顺降为临时工人。幸而后来劳动局派专人去处理这个问题，牛大顺才在十一月八日恢复了工作。
    在这期间，牛大顺三十九天没有得到一点工资。据工人和邻居们反映，他们全家每天吃豆腐渣过活，十分困难。车间党支部书记关成德发现了这个情况，就要工会设法救济，工会也没有过问。牛大顺恢复工作后不久，在十一月二十五日就病了，经医治无效，在十二月二日死去。
    牛大顺的死，虽然是因为患病，但是，这和二矿某些领导干部失掉了起码的阶级情感，对工人兄弟的困难丝毫没有同情心是分不开的。中共阳泉市委发现了这个问题后，已经派工作组进行检查。但是，二矿工会主席贺戊生还认为“市委大惊小怪，偏听偏信”；并说“牛大顺的死亡，市委可以做善后工作，我们没有办法”。
    在社会主义的企业中，这种毫无阶级感情、不关心工人疾苦的现象是决不允许继续存在的。阳泉矿务局领导方面应该对这个事件作认真的处理。庞毓英
    编者按：牛大顺死亡事件暴露了阳泉矿务局二矿某些领导干部的资产阶级思想作风是极其严重的。他们漠视工人群众的疾苦，他们采取旧社会里资本家对待工人的恶劣态度来处理工人群众的合理要求。这种种现象是不能容忍的。阳泉矿务局必须严肃认真地处理这个事件，以挽回由此而造成的不良政治影响。
    值得注意的是，在牛大顺事件中暴露出来的隐瞒工伤的现象，在阳泉矿务局所属某些矿场也是相当普遍的。例如，四矿在去年十月份到十二月上旬，隐瞒工伤的就有三十二人。四矿坑下采煤第一区“十一”采煤队工人邱桃气（青年团员）十月二十六日在工作时右手受了伤，因为采煤队和生产组的负责人都不让挂工伤，只得带伤工作。到伤势发展得很严重了，才到矿务局医院治疗，经检查发现右手骨折，治疗已经太迟了。三矿也有类似现象。出现这种现象的直接原因，是从矿场的某些领导同志到某些小组、车间的干部为了安全生产能受到表扬、获得奖金，不愿意把工伤事故上报。有的矿上的领导干部虽然也知道工伤事故的情况，却不去追查纠正。这种错误做法，不仅造成了安全工作中的虚假现象，而且使那些因工负伤的工人不能得到应有的待遇，增加了痛苦，甚至损害了健康。建议阳泉矿务局通过对牛大顺事件的处理，深入检查隐瞒工伤事故、漠视工人疾苦问题，并采取有效措施加以纠正。
