Purchasing Medicinal Materials for Export
Zhejiang Province's Ningbo mountainous region produces a large quantity of medicinal materials, including wild medicinal materials such as cicada slough, gentian, and Agkistrodon halys (蝮蛇). These mountain herbs are generally purchased by the local state-owned native produce company and then sold abroad. In 1954, Ningbo Native Produce Company's mountain herb export plan was 118% fulfilled. These exported mountain herbs can be exchanged for more than 1,700 tons of steel.

Currently, in order to purchase more mountain herbs for export supply, Ningbo Native Produce Company has not only established joint public-private purchase organizations in Ningbo and Linhai, but has also entrusted supply and marketing cooperatives in Xinchang, Shengxian, Tiantai and other places to actively purchase from farmers.

    收购药材销往国外
    浙江省宁波山区出产大批药材，其中野生药材有蝉壳、龙胆草、奇蛇等多种。这些山药一般都由当地国营土产公司收购后销往国外。一九五四年宁波土产公司的山药出口计划，完成了百分之一百一十八。这些出口的山药，可以换回钢材一千七百多吨。
    目前，宁波土产公司为了收购更多的山药供应出口，除成立公私联购组织在宁波、临海收购外，还委托新昌、嵊县、天台等地的供销合作社积极向农民收购。
