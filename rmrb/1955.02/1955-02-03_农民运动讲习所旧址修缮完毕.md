The former site of the Peasant Movement Training Institute, which Comrade Mao Zedong ran in Guangzhou during the First Revolutionary Civil War, has been renovated.

The former site of the Peasant Movement Training Institute is located in the old Panyu Confucian Temple on Huiai East Road in Guangzhou. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, all the furnishings inside were destroyed, and some buildings were also damaged due to long-term disrepair. In early 1953, the Guangzhou Municipal People's Government, based on the proposals of the broad masses of citizens, carried out renovation and restoration work. Now, all renovation work has been completed. The arrangement of Comrade Mao Zedong's office when he ran the institute, as well as the institute's teaching affairs office, lecture hall, reading room, dining hall, student dormitory, and other places, has also been preliminarily completed.

The Peasant Movement Training Institute was founded in July 1924, initially to train peasant movement cadres in Guangdong Province, and later developed into training peasant movement cadres from all over the country. Comrade Mao Zedong initially taught major courses at the institute, and became the principal in March 1926. The teachers included Zhou Enlai, Lin Boqu, Wu Yuzhang, Guo Moruo, He Xiangning, and martyrs such as Qu Qiubai, Xiao Chunu, Peng Pai, Yun Daiying, Zhang Tailei, and Deng Zhongxia.

    农民运动讲习所旧址修缮完毕
    第一次国内革命战争时期毛泽东同志在广州主办的农民运动讲习所旧址已经修缮完毕。
    农民运动讲习所旧址在广州市惠爱东路旧番禺学宫内。国民党反动派统治时期，所内一切陈设都被破坏，部分建筑也因长期失修而毁损。一九五三年初，广州市人民政府根据广大市民的提议，进行修缮和恢复原状的布置工作。现在，全部修缮工作已经完毕。毛泽东同志当年主办讲习所时的办公室和讲习所的教务处、讲堂、阅览室、膳堂、学员宿舍等地方的布置工作，也已经初步完成。
    农民运动讲习所创办于一九二四年七月，最初是训练广东省的农民运动干部，后来发展成为训练全国各地的农民运动干部。毛泽东同志起初在讲习所担任主要的课程，一九二六年三月担任所长，教员有周恩来、林伯渠、吴玉章、郭沫若、何香凝等和瞿秋白、萧楚女、彭湃、恽代英、张太雷、邓中夏等烈士。　（新华社）
