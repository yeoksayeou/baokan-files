Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, February 15th: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions has issued a letter from the World Federation of Trade Unions to the working people of Europe, calling on the working people of Europe and all trade union organizations to make March 10, 1955, a worldwide day of struggle against the Paris Accords and the revival of German militarism, and a day of active solidarity among the working people of Europe and their solidarity with the working people of Germany.

The letter to the working people of Europe states that the Paris Accords mean continuous impoverishment and intensified anti-democratic repression. If these agreements are ratified and implemented, the result will be a continuous increase in war budgets, heavier taxes, and further exploitation of the working people.

The ratification of the Paris Accords is a danger to world peace, and to the freedom and happiness of the people. Your fate is in your own hands.

The German working people are now fighting against the remilitarization of West Germany. The World Federation of Trade Unions believes that the working people of Europe will support them.

On March 10, 1955, all working men and women in Europe will organize rallies, mass meetings, petitions, and mass demonstrations based on joint action to demonstrate their firm and unwavering determination to crush the plans to remilitarize West Germany. The World Federation of Trade Unions calls on the working people of Europe to ensure the success of this international day of struggle.

    反对巴黎协定和德国军国主义复活！
    世界工联决定在三月十日举行国际斗争日
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社维也纳十五日讯：世界工会联合会书记处发表了世界工会联合会告欧洲劳动人民书，号召欧洲劳动人民和所有的工会组织把一九五五年三月十日作为世界范围的反对巴黎协定和德国军国主义复活的斗争日，作为欧洲劳动人民的积极团结以及他们同德国劳动人民团结的日子。
    告欧洲劳动人民书中说，巴黎协定意味着不断的贫穷化和变本加厉的反民主镇压。如果这些协定得到批准并且付诸实行的话，结果将是战争预算不断增加，捐税加重和劳动人民受到进一步的剥削。
    巴黎协定的批准是对世界和平、对人民的自由和幸福的危害。你们的命运掌握在你们自己的手中。
    现在德国劳动人民正在为反对西德重新军国主义化而斗争。世界工会联合会相信欧洲的劳动人民将支持他们。
    一九五五年三月十日，欧洲所有的劳动男女都将组织以联合行动为基础的集会、群众大会、请愿和群众示威，来表明他们的粉碎使西德重新军国主义化的计划的坚定的和不可动摇的决心。世界工会联合会号召欧洲劳动人民保证这个国际斗争日的成功。
