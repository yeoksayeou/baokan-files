More than 500 new exchange stations have been newly established throughout the city. Exchange teams have also been added in Wangfujing, Xidan, Qianmen, and other areas. The Beijing Company of the China Department Store concentrated more than 300 business group leaders from state-owned stores across the city before the 24th, teaching them how to convert between the old and new currencies and how to discount commodities. They also distributed 350,000 printed price tags to various business units. Many state-owned stores have now completed the discounting of commodities, and large inspection teams are reviewing each store separately. Sales staff are diligently memorizing the "Old and New Currency Conversion Table Cards."
   [Xinhua News Agency Tianjin, February 26th] All preparations for the issuance of new Renminbi in Tianjin have been completed. The Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China has established ninety-six new currency exchange offices throughout the city. The prices of most commodities in state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives throughout the city have been converted according to the old and new currency exchange rate. The No. 2 District Consumer Cooperative has created a comparison table of old and new currency prices for more than 6,000 commodities, which has been distributed to more than 30 distribution points in the district.
    Xinhua News Agency Guangzhou, February 24th: According to reports in the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" and "Wen Wei Po" on the 23rd: After the State Council issued the order on the 21st regarding the issuance of new Renminbi, it immediately attracted significant attention from compatriots in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and Macau. Many felt that this was truly an exciting and joyous event. Workers in Hong Kong's motorcycle, foreign affairs, tram, electricity, textile dyeing, shipyard, hardware, and other industries happily discussed their thoughts on the issuance of the new Renminbi. A foreign affairs worker said: The issuance of the new Renminbi makes me feel a sense of pride. For decades, I have never seen Chinese currency as stable as the Renminbi and with such high international credit. Many workers believe that only the people's own government can take care of the people's interests and convenience in this way. Business people in Hong Kong are also excited about the motherland's issuance of new currency. The manager of an import and export firm said: The new currency reduces the number of digits by four, making accounting, carrying, and payment easier. The recall of old currency and the issuance of new currency is a good thing.
    When the news of the issuance of the new Renminbi reached Macau, compatriots from all walks of life discussed it, believing that it was a correct measure. They said that the value of the Renminbi has been consistently solid for several years, prices have remained stable, and the Renminbi has gained firm credibility among the broad masses of people. The issuance of new currency today will surely be supported by the people.
   [Xinhua News Agency, February 26th] According to Singaporean newspaper reports: Overseas Chinese in Singapore welcome the issuance of the new Renminbi by the motherland's government.
    Lim Soo Yan, chairman of the Nanyang Remittance General Association of Singapore, said on the 21st: The issuance of the new Renminbi "makes the calculation of value much more convenient when overseas Chinese remit money back home."
    Another Singaporean overseas Chinese businessman said: The issuance of the new currency is a manifestation of the motherland's economic consolidation and stable prices. He said that the new Renminbi will facilitate transactions, simplify bookkeeping and exchange.
