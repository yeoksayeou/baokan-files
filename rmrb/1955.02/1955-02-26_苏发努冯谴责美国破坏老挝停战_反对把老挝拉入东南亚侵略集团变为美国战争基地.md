Xinhua News Agency, February 25th. According to Vietnam News Agency, Hanoi, February 24th: Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao Fighting Forces, issued a statement on February 23rd regarding the Lao Fighting Forces' position on striving to consolidate peace and realize Laos' unification, democracy, and independence.

The statement said: The Lao Fighting Forces' unwavering position for consolidating peace and realizing Laos' unification, democracy, and independence is to correctly and earnestly implement the Geneva Armistice Agreement. At the same time, it demands that the other party also sincerely fulfill the terms it has agreed to, first and foremost, to immediately cease all military infiltration activities, stop airlifting reinforcements, and supplying weapons to armed groups in the Sang Neua and Phong Saly provinces, where the Lao Fighting Forces are currently regrouping. Only in that way can peace in Laos be consolidated, and only then will there be favorable conditions for unifying the country on the basis of sincere consultation and cooperation at the current political conference.

A political solution should be based on the Geneva Armistice Agreement, and on the principles of ensuring the Lao people's basic democratic freedoms and realizing Laos' unification through free and universal elections.
	The statement pointed out: The Lao Fighting Forces' domestic policy lies in safeguarding and consolidating peace, realizing basic democratic freedoms, improving the people's material and spiritual life, and implementing free and universal elections, thereby realizing the motherland's true national unification and complete independence. In order to implement this policy, a broad national united front should be established.

The statement also said that the Lao Fighting Forces' foreign policy includes: guaranteeing the establishment of diplomatic relations with neighboring countries—the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the People's Republic of China, Cambodia, India, Burma, and Thailand—based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as proposed in the joint statements of the Chinese, Indian, and Chinese and Burmese prime ministers; agreeing to join the French Union, cooperating with France in fulfilling the armistice agreement, and ensuring France's legitimate economic and cultural interests in Laos.

The statement said: We welcome the Lao King's statement on establishing diplomatic relations based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. However, we are surprised to see that the Lao Royal Government has dispatched its observers to the Bangkok Conference convened by the U.S. imperialists with the aim of strengthening the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization military bloc. This is a dangerous action, which may create conditions for the other party to threaten the two regrouping provinces of the Lao Fighting Forces, undermine peace, and re-ignite hostilities.

In summary, our domestic and foreign policies fully conform to the ardent wishes of the Lao people and the peace-loving people of all countries in the world.

The statement then listed facts to illustrate that the other party has continuously attempted to infiltrate and attack the regrouping areas of the Lao Fighting Forces after the ceasefire, massacred and looted Lao residents, and other acts violating the armistice agreement. The statement pointed out that even during the political conference held by the Royal Government's political delegation and the Lao Fighting Forces' political delegation in the Plain of Jars to seek appropriate measures to resolve Laos' fundamental political problems, when the Lao delegation suggested that both sides guarantee the cessation of all conflicts, the Royal Government delegation withdrew from the meeting twenty days ago and returned to Vientiane, without specifying a definite date for returning to the meeting. All of the above acts of sabotaging the armistice agreement are part of the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to sabotage the armistice agreements in Laos, as well as in Vietnam and Cambodia, and to turn Laos into a U.S. war base.

The statement then criticized the U.S. for sabotaging the Lao ceasefire, saying: As soon as the Geneva Accords were concluded, the U.S. government established the so-called Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, and designated Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam as so-called "protected areas" within this bloc. In addition, the U.S. imperialists have instigated the Thai government to intensify infiltration activities in Laos. A Thai military delegation, under the guise of "goodwill," visited Laos in early February to survey and film many military locations in Laos and take photographs.

The statement pointed out: All these activities show that the U.S. imperialists are conspiring to drag Laos into the aggressive Southeast Asia bloc. These are all actions that seriously violate the Geneva Accords. These actions infringe upon the sovereignty and independence of Laos and other countries in Indochina, threaten the peace and security of Laos and Southeast Asian countries, and have a negative impact on the current political conference between the Lao Royal Government and the Lao Fighting Forces.

The statement went on to point out that, in view of this serious situation, we would like to emphasize once again that the Lao Fighting Forces, which have made concessions and abandoned their vast bases in ten provinces to regroup in only two provinces, are eager for peace, hoping to achieve democratic freedom and national unity through universal elections.

Souphanouvong, on behalf of the Lao Fighting Forces, solemnly declares that he will resolutely fight for the strict implementation of the Geneva Accords, first and foremost for the cessation of the conflict in the two provinces of Sang Neua and Phong Saly, to continue holding political conferences to resolve fundamental political problems, to realize democratic freedoms, to improve the people's living standards, to hold universal elections, to establish a peaceful, unified, democratic and independent Laos, and to establish friendly relations with neighboring countries and Asian countries in accordance with the Five Principles. Resolutely oppose all acts that undermine the Geneva Armistice Agreement, resolutely oppose the conspiracy to gradually occupy the two provinces of Sang Neua and Phong Saly by force and sabotage the political conference, and resolutely oppose the conspiracy to drag Laos into an aggressive military bloc headed by U.S. imperialists in order to turn Laos into a U.S. war base.

The statement concluded by expressing firm belief that the unity and struggle of the entire Lao people, the efforts of the International Supervisory and Supervisory Commission, and the support of peace-loving people around the world, especially the people of Southeast Asia and the people of France, will shatter the perfidious conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists and their servants, will ensure that the Geneva Accords are respected and properly implemented, and will safeguard and consolidate peace in Laos, as well as in Indochina and throughout Southeast Asia.

    苏发努冯谴责美国破坏老挝停战
    反对把老挝拉入东南亚侵略集团变为美国战争基地
    【新华社二十五日讯】据越南通讯社河内二十四日讯：寮国战斗部队领袖苏发努冯亲王在二月二十三日就寮国战斗部队争取巩固和平、实现老挝的统一、民主和独立的立场，发表声明。
    声明说：寮国战斗部队为巩固和平和实现老挝的统一、民主和独立的坚定不移的立场就是正确地、认真地履行日内瓦停战协定。同时要求对方也真诚地履行它已经同意的条款，首先是立即停止一切军事渗入活动，停止空投增援部队和以武器供应现在寮国战斗部队重新集结的桑怒和丰沙里省份中的武装集团。只有那样，老挝的和平才能得到巩固，并且才有有利条件使这个国家在目前政治会议上真诚协商和合作的基础上统一起来。
    政治解决应该以日内瓦停战协定为基础，以确保老挝人民的基本民主自由的原则和通过自由普选实现老挝统一的原则为基础。　声明指出：寮国战斗部队的对内政策在于维护和巩固和平，实现基本的民主自由，改善人民的物质和精神生活，实行自由普选，从而实现祖国真正的全国统一和完全的独立。为了执行这个政策，就应当成立一个广泛的民族统一战线。
    声明又说，寮国战斗部队的外交政策包括：保证以中、印和中、缅总理的联合声明中所提出的和平共处的五项原则为基础，同邻国——越南民主共和国、中华人民共和国、柬埔寨、印度、缅甸和泰国——建立外交关系；同意加入法兰西联邦，在履行停战协定方面同法国进行合作，确保法国在老挝的合法的经济和文化利益。
    声明说：我们欢迎老挝国王发表的关于以和平共处的五项原则为基础来建立外交关系的声明。但是，我们很惊异地看到，老挝王国政府却派遣了它的观察员出席美帝国主义者所召开的目的在于加强侵略性的东南亚条约组织军事集团的曼谷会议。这是一个危险的行动，它可能为对方威胁寮国战斗部队的两个集结省份、破坏和平和重新挑起敌对行动创造条件。
    总而言之，我们的对内政策和对外政策完全符合老挝人民以及全世界爱好和平的各国人民的热切愿望。
    声明接着列举事实说明对方在停火后不断设法渗入和进攻寮国战斗部队的集结区，屠杀和劫掠老挝居民等违犯停战协定的行为。声明指出，甚至在王国政府政治代表团和寮国战斗部队政治代表团在查尔平原为寻求适当措施以解决老挝根本性的政治问题而举行的政治会议上，当寮国代表建议双方保证停止一切冲突时，王国政府代表团却在离现在二十天以前退出了会议回到万象，并且也没确定回来参加会议的确切日期。所有上述破坏停战协定的行为，都是美帝国主义者破坏老挝以及越南、柬埔寨的停战协定和把老挝变为美国战争基地这一阴谋的一部分。
    声明接着抨击美国破坏老挝的停战说：日内瓦协定刚一缔结，美国政府就成立了所谓东南亚集体防务条约，把老挝、柬埔寨和南越划入这一集团的所谓的“保护地区”之内。此外，美帝国主义者还嗾使泰国政府加紧渗入老挝的活动。打着“亲善”招牌的泰国军事代表团已经在二月初到过老挝，对老挝的许多军事地点进行勘查、拍摄电影和照相。
    声明指出：所有这些活动都表明了，美帝国主义者正在阴谋把老挝拉进侵略性的东南亚集团。这些都是严重违反日内瓦协定的行动。这些行动侵犯了老挝和印度支那其他各国的主权和独立，威胁着老挝和东南亚各国的和平和安全，并且对目前老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队之间的政治会议产生了不良的影响。
    声明接着指出，有鉴于这种严重的局势，我们愿意再次着重指出，已经作了让步、并且放弃了他们在十个省份的广大根据地而集结到仅仅两个省份的寮国战斗部队，是热望和平、希望实现民主自由和通过普选获得全国统一的。
    苏发努冯代表寮国战斗部队郑重声明，坚决为严格履行日内瓦协定首先为停止在桑怒和丰沙里两省的冲突而斗争，继续举行政治会议以便解决根本性的政治问题，实现民主自由，改善人民生活水平，举行普选，建立一个和平、统一、民主和独立的老挝，根据五项原则同邻国和亚洲国家建立友好关系。坚决反对一切破坏日内瓦停战协定的行为，坚决反对用武力逐步占领桑怒和丰沙里两省和破坏政治会议的阴谋，坚决反对为了把老挝变为美国战争基地而把老挝拉入到以美帝国主义者为首的侵略性军事集团里去的阴谋。
    声明最后表示坚信老挝全体人民的团结和斗争，国际监督和监察委员会的努力和世界爱好和平人民尤其是东南亚人民和法国人民的支持，将粉碎美帝国主义者和他们的仆从的背信阴谋，将使日内瓦协定得到尊重和正确的履行，将维护和巩固老挝以及印度支那和整个东南亚的和平。
