    Rural Party Grassroots Organizations Must Also Implement the Principle of Collective Leadership
    Ding Li
    Collective leadership is the highest principle of our Party's leadership, and no matter whether it is a high-level leading organ of the Party or a grassroots organization of the Party, there is no exception. Some people believe that the high-level leading organs of the Party are responsible for deciding on the guidelines and policies, so collective leadership is naturally required. As for the grassroots organizations of the Party, collective leadership seems dispensable. This view is obviously wrong. The grassroots organizations of the Party are the core fortresses of the Party among the people, and are an important link in finally implementing the Party's various policies among the masses. If the principle of the Party's collective leadership is not observed, and the wisdom and experience of the branch committee and all Party members are not concentrated, the Party's various policies cannot be correctly implemented and executed. However, the principle of collective leadership has not been observed and implemented by all of our Party's grassroots organizations. This must be brought to our attention and improved.
    The principle of the Party's collective leadership requires that all major issues must be discussed at the Party committee meeting. However, at present, many rural Party branch secretaries are accustomed to making decisions individually, and are not accustomed to raising major issues for discussion at the branch committee. They believe that raising issues for discussion at the branch committee is adding trouble, and it is easier and more convenient to make decisions themselves. Therefore, they engage in paternalism, monopolize, and act arbitrarily in their work. Many branch secretaries in many branches act as lone wolves, or the branch secretary and the village head perform a "duet", and other branch committee members feel that they have positions without power, and cannot exert their energy, so they have no choice but to stand by. As a result, in some rural areas, there is a serious situation where "nine committee members, seven don't care, the branch secretary and village head, take on everything." This is a major aspect of violating the principle of the Party's collective leadership. Another aspect of violating the principle of collective leadership is that committee members lack a high sense of responsibility in their work. They mistakenly believe: "It doesn't matter if you don't care about branch work, there are always people to shoulder the responsibility." "Let the branch secretary do it if he is capable." Therefore, they abandon their responsibility to participate in collective leadership, and even do not actively carry out their share of the work. There are also a few branch committee members who turn "division of labor" into "separation of families," and make decisions on their own without raising major issues in their work to the branch committee for discussion. The result of all these thoughts and practices is to weaken the Party's collective leadership.
    Facts have proved that wherever the branch implements the principle of collective leadership, the work is done well, otherwise, there will be shortcomings or errors in the work. Last autumn, when the Juren Village Branch of the Communist Party of China in Bin County, Heilongjiang Province, discussed the plan to establish a cooperative, the branch committee members had great differences in the process of deliberation. Some believed that the conditions were met and advocated for establishing more cooperatives, while others believed that the conditions were not met and advocated for not establishing any. The branch secretary didn't know what to do. So, it was brought up to the branch committee for discussion. At the meeting, after analyzing the specific situation of the mutual aid groups in the village based on the spirit of the CCP Central Committee's resolution on developing agricultural producers' cooperatives, everyone's thinking was unified, and they unanimously agreed that two cooperatives could be established. Therefore, everyone felt that this meeting was well held, which not only solved the problem of establishing cooperatives but also improved the level of policy. Branch Secretary Li Fengcai said: "Thanks to everyone's discussion, otherwise I might have acted rashly again." Some committee members said: "If we hold such meetings more often, the work will be easier to do." On the contrary, the development plan of the agricultural producers' cooperative in Mayan Village, Shangzhi County, was neither deliberated among the masses nor discussed by the branch committee, but was determined by the branch secretary and the village head alone. Although the district committee also approved this plan and sent cadres to help realize it, the plan failed because the conditions were not ripe. These two examples are enough to show how important collective leadership is and how dangerous individual monopoly is.
    To realize the collective leadership of the Party's grassroots organizations, it is also necessary to consult with all Party members on major issues. Therefore, convening a general meeting of Party members to discuss and decide on some major issues is an important method of implementing the principle of collective leadership in grassroots organizations. Through the general meeting of Party members, not only can the experience and wisdom of Party members be concentrated to supplement the lack of experience of the branch committee, not only can the comrades of the branch committee be supervised by all Party members to overcome the shortcomings of the branch committee not being good at listening to the opinions and criticisms of Party members, but also can the active leading role of Party members in various rural tasks be better brought into play.
    When the Juren Village Branch of the Communist Party of China in Bin County was carrying out summer weeding last year, they submitted the branch's summer weeding work plan to the general meeting of Party members for discussion. During the discussion, Party members put forward many supplementary opinions, among which the most important was that the plan did not mention how to cultivate and improve the targets for establishing cooperatives during the summer weeding period. After research by the branch committee, these correct opinions were added to the plan. Through this meeting, the comrades of the branch committee realized the importance of convening the general meeting of Party members to give play to the collective wisdom of Party members. Some branch committee members said: "If we still don't give play to the role of Party members as we did in the past, these tasks will be forgotten again." After the general meeting of the branch was held, the Party members also felt that their thinking was clear. Some Party members said: "In the past, we were always asked to take the lead, but we didn't even know the branch's plan, so how could we take the lead? After this discussion, our thinking is clear, and we are more motivated to take the lead."
    To implement the principle of collective leadership in the Party's grassroots organizations, it is also necessary to be good at giving play to the role of various organizations in rural areas, such as the Youth League, the Women's Federation, and the militia. Under the unified leadership of the branch, division of labor and cooperation should be implemented, and unified steps and actions should be taken to ensure the implementation of the Party's resolutions. However, some of our branches do not pay attention to giving play to the role of various organizations. After a certain task of the Party is determined, they neither specifically help them nor assign them work tasks. This is obviously detrimental to strengthening the collective leadership of the grassroots Party organizations and should be changed. The experience of the Juren Village Branch of the Communist Party of China in Bin County in this regard is better. Their method is: First, all Party meetings that study and discuss important work related to the entire village are attended by the main responsible cadres and relevant personnel of the village government, the Youth League, the Women's Federation, and the militia, so that they can understand the intentions and requirements of the branch and help them formulate work plans based on the branch's plan and the characteristics of each organization, and fully give play to the role of each organization. Second, the branch regularly inspects the work of the government and mass organizations, listens to their work reports, discovers problems in a timely manner, and helps solve them, strengthening the specific leadership of each organization. Third, when each organization holds a meeting, the branch sends a branch committee member in charge of leading the organization to participate, giving specific guidance and assistance.
    With the development of socialist transformation of agriculture, the Party's tasks in rural areas are becoming increasingly arduous, which requires the rural Party's grassroots organizations to further improve their leadership level, and strengthening the collective leadership of the grassroots Party organizations is the most important link in improving the leadership level of the Party organizations. Therefore, the rural Party's grassroots organizations must earnestly strengthen collective leadership in order to correctly implement the Party's various policies and smoothly promote the cause of socialist transformation of agriculture.

    农村党的基层组织也要贯彻集体领导的原则
    丁力
    集体领导是我们党的领导的最高原则，不管是党的高级领导机关或者党的基层组织都不能例外。有人认为党的高级领导机关是决定方针政策的，自然需要集体领导，至于党的基层组织，集体领导似乎可有可无。这种看法显然是错误的。党的基层组织是党在人民群众中的核心堡垒，是把党的各项政策最后贯彻到群众中去的重要环节，如果不遵守党的集体领导的原则，不集中支部委员会和全体党员的智慧和经验，就不能把党的各项政策正确地贯彻和执行。但集体领导的原则并没有被我们所有党的基层组织所遵守和贯彻。这是必须引起注意并加以改进的。
    党的集体领导的原则要求，一切重大问题都必须拿到党委会上讨论。但目前却有不少农村党的支部书记，习惯个人决定问题，不习惯把重大的问题提到支部委员会上讨论。他们认为提到支部委员会上讨论是增加麻烦，不如自己决定来得省事，干起顺手。因此，在工作中就包办代替、独断专行。不少支部的支部书记一个人“单枪匹马”“耍光杆司令”，或支部书记和村长“演二人转”，其他支部委员感到有职无权，有劲使不上，只好袖手旁观。以致在有的农村造成“九大委员，七大不管，支书村长，大包大揽”的严重的少数人包办一切的情况。这是违反党的集体领导原则的一个主要方面。违反集体领导原则的另一个方面是委员工作上缺乏高度的责任心。他们错误地认为：“支部工作不管也没啥，反正有扛大棵的。”“支书能干就叫他干呗”。因此他们就放弃了自己参加集体领导的责任，甚至对自己分担的一部分工作也不积极进行。也有少数的支部委员变“分工”为“分家”，工作中有重大问题，也不提到支部委员会上讨论而擅自决定。所有这些想法和作法的结果，都削弱了党的集体领导。
    事实证明，凡是支部贯彻了集体领导原则的，工作就作得好，否则工作就出现缺点或错误。中共黑龙江省宾县居仁村支部去年秋天讨论建社计划时，支部委员在酝酿过程中分歧很大，有的认为条件具备了，主张多办，有的认为条件不具备，主张不办，支部书记也不知道如何是好。于是就提到支部委员会上讨论。会上大家根据中共中央关于发展农业生产合作社的决议的精神，结合本村互助组的具体情况分析后，大家思想统一了，一致认为可以办两个社。因此，大家都感到这次会开得好，既解决了建社的问题，又提高了政策水平。支部书记李凤财说：“多亏大家这么一讨论，要不我又可能冒进了。”有的委员说：“照这样的会多开几回，工作就好干了。”相反，尚志县麻延村的农业生产合作社的发展计划，既没有在群众中酝酿，也没有在支部委员会上讨论，只是由支部书记和村长两个人确定的；区委虽也批准了这个计划，并派了干部帮助实现这个计划，结果由于条件不成熟，计划失败了。这两个事例已经足够说明集体领导是何等重要，个人包办是多么危险。
    要实现党的基层组织的集体领导，还必须在重大问题上同全体党员商量，因此，召开党员大会讨论和决定一些重大问题是在基层组织中贯彻集体领导原则的重要方法。通过党员大会，不但可以把党员的经验和智慧集中起来，补充支部委员会经验的不足，不但可以使支部委员会的同志受到全体党员的监督，克服支部委员会不善于听取党员的意见和批评的缺点，而且还可以更好地发挥党员在农村各项工作中的积极带头作用。
    中共宾县居仁村支部在去年夏锄时，把支部的夏锄工作计划提到支部大会上讨论。讨论中，党员提出很多补充意见，其中特别重要的是计划中没有提到夏锄期间如何培养和提高建社对象等问题，经过支部委员会研究，把这些正确的意见补充到计划中去。通过这次会议，支部委员会的同志们更加体会到召开支部大会发挥党员集体智慧的重要。有的支部委员说：“如果还像过去那样，不发挥党员的作用，这些工作又会忘掉了。”支部大会开过以后，党员也感到思想明确了，有的党员就说：“过去老叫我们带头，我们连支部计划都不知道，怎么能带头。这回一讨论，思想明确了，带头也就有劲了。”
    要在党的基层组织中贯彻集体领导的原则，还必须善于发挥农村中的青年团、妇联、民兵等各个组织的作用，在支部的统一领导下实行分工合作，统一步调，统一行动，才能保证党的决议的贯彻执行。但我们有些支部是不重视发挥各个组织的作用的，当党的某项工作任务确定之后，既不具体的帮助他们，也不给他们布置工作任务，这对加强基层党组织的集体领导显然是不利的，应该加以改变。中共宾县居仁村支部在这方面的经验是较好的。他们的办法是：第一，凡是研究和讨论有关全村的重要工作的党的会议，均吸收村政府、青年团、妇联、民兵等组织的主要负责干部和有关人员参加，使他们领会支部的意图和要求，并帮助他们根据支部的计划和各个组织的特点制订工作计划，充分发挥各个组织的作用；第二，支部定期检查政府和群众团体的工作，听取他们的工作汇报、及时发现问题并帮助解决，加强对各个组织的具体领导；第三，各组织召开会议时，支部派负责领导该组织工作的支部委员参加，给予具体的指导和帮助。
    随着农业社会主义改造的发展，党在农村的工作任务日益繁重，这就要求农村党的基层组织要进
  一步提高自己的领导水平，而加强基层党组织的集体领导，正是提高党组织领导水平的最重要的一环。因此，农村党的基层组织必须切实加强集体领导，才能正确地贯彻党的各项政策，顺利地推进农业社会主义改造的事业。
