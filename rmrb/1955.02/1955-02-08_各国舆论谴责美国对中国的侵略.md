    Foreign Media Condemns US Aggression Against China
    "Democratic Korea" Publishes Article:
    Korean People Support the Just Demands of the Chinese People
    [Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 7] The "Democratic Korea" newspaper published an article on the 7th, titled "The Just Demands of the Chinese People," commenting on the reply sent by Zhou Enlai, Premier and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld.
    The article pointed out that Premier Zhou Enlai's reply once again condemned the United States' aggressive actions against China's territory of Taiwan, and exposed that the proposal put forward by the New Zealand representative was merely an interference in China's internal affairs, with the aim of concealing the United States' aggressive behavior. The article stated that the Korean people, along with fair-minded public opinion around the world, believe that Premier Zhou Enlai's proposition is perfectly justified and support it.
    The article pointed out that the so-called "ceasefire" proposal put forward by New Zealand "avoids the issue of condemning and stopping the aggressive acts of the US forces, which is a crucial issue for eliminating tensions in the Far East; this proposal also describes China's exercise of sovereignty to liberate Taiwan and China's coastal islands as a threat to peace and security in the Far East. It is clear to everyone that this proposal is absolutely untenable from both a legal and factual point of view."
    The article concluded: Premier Zhou Enlai stated that China could not send representatives to the United Nations Security Council to discuss the New Zealand proposal, and stated that the People's Republic of China could only send representatives to participate in the Security Council's discussions if the discussions were for the purpose of discussing the Soviet proposal and expelling the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek clique from the Security Council, and if the representatives of the People's Republic of China were present representing China. Premier Zhou Enlai's statement is entirely justifiable. Premier Zhou Enlai's reply has been supported by all honest people around the world.

Indonesian "Sunday Courier" Weekly Says
    US Occupation of Taiwan Aggravates the Far East Situation
    [Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 7] The Indonesian "Sunday Courier" weekly said on the 6th that the dangerous situation in the Far East, caused by the United States' interference in China's internal affairs, is becoming increasingly serious, as the United States attempts to mobilize Asian armed forces at the upcoming Manila Treaty Organization conference to be used by the United States. This will be exploited by the United States' policy of "using Asians to fight Asians."
    Referring to the situation in Taiwan, the "Sunday Courier" weekly pointed out that the United States is engaged in intimidation and provocation on the one hand, while playing the trick of a "ceasefire" on the other, to create the impression that the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan is wrong, while the US occupation of Taiwan is right. The newspaper said that, in fact, Taiwan under foreign occupation is nothing more than a pistol pointed at the People's Republic of China, and that the so-called US "protection" of Taiwan is an attack on the People's Republic of China.
    The newspaper concluded by calling for active efforts to realize the long-term aspirations of the Asian people: "All foreign forces must withdraw from Asia, and the Asian people must be allowed to solve their own problems without foreign interference."

Editor-in-Chief of Swedish "New Times" Writes
    China's Seat in the United Nations Should Not Be Usurped by the Chiang Gang
    [Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, February 7] TASS, Stockholm, February 6: Ri Ro Edberg, the editor-in-chief and member of parliament of the Swedish Social Democratic Party's "New Times," said in an article on the situation in the Taiwan region: "It is an abnormal phenomenon: occupying China's seats in the United Nations and the Security Council are the ousted Chiang Kai-shek and his group, rather than the real government representing the world's most populous country."

Argentine and Brazilian Public Opinion Points Out
    Latin American People Demand US Troops Withdraw from Taiwan
    [Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, February 7] TASS, Buenos Aires, February 6: The United States' interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China has aroused widespread indignation among the public in Argentina and Brazil. Many newspapers in these two countries have published commentaries defending the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China over Taiwan and Penghu, and opposing US aggressive acts in the Far East.
    The Argentine newspaper "Democracia" wrote that Beijing has the right to consider Taiwan as "an inseparable part of its territory." "Democracia" pointed out that "keeping Taiwan in the hands of Chiang Kai-shek is tantamount to handing it over to the Americans..." Another Argentine newspaper, "El Mundo," pointed out: The US government's attitude toward all of China, especially Taiwan, is an unprecedented example of serious violation of international law. The newspaper went on to say: "China's sovereignty fully extends to Taiwan and Penghu. This has been determined by history and the Cairo Declaration… The attitude of US officials on the Taiwan issue can only be explained by imperialist aggressive intentions..." The newspaper said: "The People's Republic of China has complete rights over Taiwan. US troops should get out of Taiwan. This is the wish of the Latin American people, who fully support the Asian people's struggle to get rid of imperialist oppression."
    Many Brazilian newspapers also emphasized that the United States' interference in China's internal affairs is a serious threat to peace and security in the Far East. Many newspapers stated that the Chiang Kai-shek clique has never represented the Chinese people, and pointed out that the People's Republic of China's struggle to liberate Taiwan is just. "O Popular" wrote: "There is US aggression in Taiwan." The newspaper used many facts to prove this statement. "Voz Operária" wrote: Taiwan has belonged to the Chinese people for many centuries, and it is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. The newspaper pointed out: "The Chinese people have lived on the island of Taiwan long before the American continent was discovered." The newspaper expressed its conviction that China can defend its inalienable rights.

### 各国舆论谴责美国对中国的侵略

    各国舆论谴责美国对中国的侵略“民主朝鲜报”发表文章说
    朝鲜人民支持中国人民的正当要求
    【新华社七日讯】据朝鲜中央通讯社平壤七日讯：“民主朝鲜报”发表一篇文章、题目是“中国人民的正当要求”，评论中华人民共和国总理兼外交部长周恩来给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的复电。
    文章指出，周恩来外长的复电再次谴责了美国对中国领土台湾的侵略行为，并且揭露新西兰代表提出的建议不过是对中国内政的一种干涉，其目的在于掩饰美国的侵略行为。文章说，朝鲜人民同世界正直的舆论一道，认为周恩来外长的主张是十分正当的，并且拥护这个主张。
    文章指出，新西兰提出的所谓“停火”建议“避开了谴责和制止美国部队的侵略行为问题，而这个问题是消除远东紧张局势的至关重要的问题；这一建议还把中国行使解放台湾和中国沿海岛屿的主权说成是对远东和平和安全的威胁。人人都清楚，无论是从法律观点还是从事实观点来说，这个建议都是绝对站不住脚的。”
    文章最后说：周恩来外长表示中国不能派代表参加联合国安全理事会讨论新西兰建议，并表示，只有在为了讨论苏联的提案并在安全理事会驱逐蒋介石集团的代表而由中华人民共和国的代表出席代表中国的情况下，中华人民共和国才能派遣代表参加安全理事会的讨论。周恩来外长的这种表示是完全理所当然的。周恩来外长的复电受到了全世界所有正直人们的拥护。印度尼西亚“星期日信使”周刊说
    美国侵占台湾使远东局势严重化
    【新华社雅加达七日电】印度尼西亚“星期日信使”周刊六日说，由于美国干涉中国内政而引起的远东危险局势是越来越严重了，因为美国企图在即将召开的马尼拉条约组织会议上把亚洲的武装部队动员起来听候美国使用。这将被美国的“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的政策所利用。
    “星期日信使”周刊在谈到台湾局势时指出，美国一方面在进行恫吓和挑衅，而同时又在玩弄“停火”的把戏，以造成这样的印象：似乎中国人民解放台湾是错误的，而美国占领台湾是正确的。这家报纸说，事实上，在外国占领下的台湾不过是指向中华人民共和国的手枪，而所谓美国对台湾的“保护”是对中华人民共和国的攻击。
    报纸最后呼吁进行积极努力以实现亚洲人民的长期愿望：“一切外国势力必须撤出亚洲，必须让亚洲人民在没有外国干涉的情况下解决自己的问题。”瑞典“新时报”总编辑撰文说
    联合国的中国席位不应由蒋贼窃据
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社斯德哥尔摩六日讯：瑞典社会民主党的“新时报”的总编辑、议员里·罗·埃德堡在一篇关于台湾地区局势的文章中说道：“这是一种不正常的现象：占有中国在联合国和安全理事会的席位的是被赶走的蒋介石和他的集团，而不是代表世界上人口最多的国家的真正政府。”阿根廷和巴西的舆论指出
    拉丁美洲人民要求美军从台湾撤走
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯六日讯：美国对中华人民共和国内政的干涉引起了阿根廷和巴西公众普遍的愤慨。这两个国家的许多报纸发表言论，维护中华人民共和国对台湾和澎湖的合法权利，反对美国在远东的侵略行为。
    阿根廷“民主报”写道：北京有权认为台湾是
  “自己领土的不可分割的一部分”。“民主报”指出，“使台湾继续留在蒋介石手中，这就等于把它交到美国人手里……”另一家阿根廷报纸“目的报”指出：美国政府对整个中国、特别是对台湾的态度，是严重破坏国际法的一个空前的例子。这家报纸接着说：“中国的主权完全达到台湾和澎湖。这已由历史和开罗宣言确定，……美国官方人士对台湾问题的态度只能以帝国主义的侵略企图来解释。……”这家报纸说：“中华人民共和国对台湾有完全的权利。美国军队应从台湾滚出去。这就是拉丁美洲人民的愿望，拉丁美洲人民完全支持为摆脱帝国主义压迫而斗争的亚洲人民。”
    巴西许多报纸也强调指出：美国对中国内政的干涉是对远东和平和安全的严重威胁。许多报纸说明蒋介石集团从来也没有代表中国人民，并指出中华人民共和国争取解放台湾的斗争是正义的。“人民报”写道：“在台湾存在着美国的侵略”。这家报纸并以许多事实来证明这句话。“工人呼声报”写道：台湾在许多世纪以来就属于中国人民，它是中国领土不可分割的一部分。这家报纸指出：“还在发现美洲大陆以前很久，中国人民就已经住在台湾岛了。”这家报纸表示确信，中国能够捍卫自己不可剥夺的权利。
