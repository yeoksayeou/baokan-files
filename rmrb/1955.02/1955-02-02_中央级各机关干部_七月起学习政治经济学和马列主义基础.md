Cadres from central level organs such as the State Council and its affiliated ministries and commissions, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, are all commencing their 1955 theoretical studies, based on their theoretical studies in 1954. Approximately 90% of the cadres who should participate in theoretical studies are participating in advanced, intermediate, and elementary level study groups. The advanced and intermediate groups will complete Chapter XI of the History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) by February 15th, and Chapter XII by the end of April, thus concluding the study of the History of the CPSU(B). The elementary groups will also complete the Reader on Common Knowledge of Economic Construction by the end of April. After two months of preparation in May and June, they will begin a new unit of theoretical study. There are two courses in the new unit of theoretical study: 1. Political Economics course. This course will be divided into two classes. Those with higher theoretical levels and self-study ability will participate in the Political Economics Research Class, focusing on self-study. The other Political Economics class will focus on lectures. 2. Foundations of Marxism-Leninism course, covering Chapters I to VIII of the History of the CPSU(B). In order to meet this new learning task, the government Party committee is actively training theoretical teachers and tutors. In September 1954, the government Party committee selected 329 on-the-job cadres from various organs to audit Political Economics at the Marxist-Leninist Academy. Starting in July this year, after the cadres of various organs begin to study Political Economics, they can serve as theoretical teachers and tutors of Political Economics. The government Party committee also plans to use the method of "learning while teaching" to run short-term training courses to train theoretical teachers and tutors for the Foundations of Marxism-Leninism course.

    中央级各机关干部
    七月起学习政治经济学和马列主义基础
    国务院和所属各部、委及全国人民代表大会常务委员会、最高人民法院、最高人民检察院等国家机关干部，在一九五四年理论学习的基础上，都开始了一九五五年的理论学习。参加高级、中级、初级各组理论学习的干部占应参加理论学习干部总人数的百分之九十左右。高级组和中级组将于二月十五日学完联共（布）党史第十一章，四月底学完第十二章，即结束联共（布）党史的学习。初级组于四月底也将学完经济建设常识读本；经过五月、六月两个月的准备工作，即开始新单元的理论学习。新单元的理论学习有两门课程：一、政治经济学课程，这一课程将分两个班次，理论水平较高具有自修能力者，参加政治经济学研究班，以自修为主，另一政治经济学班则以讲授为主。二、马克思列宁主义基础课程，讲授联共（布）党史第一章至第八章。为了迎接这一新的学习任务，政府党委正在积极培养理论教员和辅导员。一九五四年九月间，政府党委即在各机关抽调在职干部三百二十九人，送马克思列宁学院旁听政治经济学，今年七月起，各机关干部开始学习政治经济学后，他们即可担任政治经济学的理论教员和辅导员。政府党委还准备用“边学边教”的方式，开办短期训练班，为马克思列宁主义基础课程训练理论教员和辅导员。
