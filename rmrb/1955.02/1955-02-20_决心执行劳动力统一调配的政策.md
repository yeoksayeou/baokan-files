Column: Response to Criticism and Suggestions

    A letter from the First Mechanical Engineering Team of the Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Water Resources: The criticism from readers in the "Reader's Letters" column on December 26th of last year was correct. We simply listened to the requests of the old migrant workers building the Guanting Reservoir and the opinions of the Ce'tian Township People's Government. In our eagerness to complete our construction tasks, we directly recruited migrant workers from the countryside without going through the Yanggao County labor department. After Ce'tian Township received a call from the Yanggao County People's Government stopping us from doing this, we did not take the initiative to contact the county. This erroneous practice affected Yanggao County's unified arrangements for labor allocation and disaster area production and self-rescue work. We have instructed our team's Labor and Wage Section to conduct a thorough self-examination. In the future, we are determined to earnestly implement the policy of unified labor allocation to prevent similar problems from happening again.

专栏：批评建议的反应

    决心执行劳动力统一调配的政策
    水利部工程总局第一机械工程总队来信：去年十二月二十六日“读者来信专页”上读者对我们的批评是正确的。我们单纯听了建设官厅水库的老民工的要求和册田乡人民政府的意见，为了急于完成自己的建设任务，就不通过阳高县劳动部门，直接下乡招雇民工；在册田乡接到阳高县人民政府制止我们这种做法的电话后，也没有主动和县里联系。这种错误做法，影响了阳高县对劳动力调配和灾区生产自救工作的统一安排。我们已责成我队劳动工资科进行深刻检查，今后并决心认真执行劳动力统一调配的政策，防止再发生类似问题。
