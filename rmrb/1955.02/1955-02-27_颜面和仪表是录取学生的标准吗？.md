Are Appearance and Demeanor Criteria for Admitting Students?

In Xiangtan City, Hunan Province, at 2 Liushuigou, 17th Zonghou Street, lives a diligent and studious young man named Tan Zheng.

In the summer of 1954, Tan Zheng graduated from the junior high school department of Xiangtan City Middle School. His grades in all subjects were excellent, and his conduct appraisal was Grade A. How many people praised this student of excellent character and learning!

During the summer vacation, the school began enrollment, and Tan Zheng participated in the entrance examination for the senior high school of Xiangtan City Middle School. On the day of the exam, he smoothly completed all the papers. However, the result of the exam was that he failed.

When Tan Zheng received the school's notification, he felt deeply disappointed and pained, and he almost doubted that his eyes were deceiving him.

Tan Zheng came to the school office, and the principal immediately pushed him to the director of studies. Tan Zheng raised many questions to the director of studies, waiting quietly for the other party's answer. The office was as silent as death. Some were casually flipping through newspapers, some were dozing off at their desks, and some were using the excuse of going to the toilet to slip away.

After a long time, a teacher named Li Jiefu unexpectedly asked:

	"Do you have a stomach problem?"

	"No!" Tan Zheng answered categorically.

	"Then, you must have something wrong with your chest."

Tan Zheng was about to argue, but Teacher Li suddenly put on an unusually kind tone and said, "We understand you, and we also sympathize with you very much... To be honest: you are a good student, but it's just that your appearance and demeanor are a little... not... very... that... way."

Kind words accompanied by kind glances swept over Tan Zheng.

	"Actually, why must you go to school? Isn't learning to be a tailor the same as serving the motherland and the people?"

	"Weren't Gorky and Wu Yun Duo also diligent and hard-working?" Then the people in the office started discussing one after another. "With such a demeanor, wouldn't it be a joke to go to university in the future? For the appearance of our school, it is also not very elegant, is it?"

Tan Zheng was very angry. He clearly remembered that a skinny and pale-faced student was admitted, a person suffering from third-stage tuberculosis who often coughed up blood. How could he be admitted, but I failed? So, he went to the Xiangtan Special District Cultural and Educational Section, hoping wholeheartedly that the Cultural and Educational Section would come out to correct the bias. The head of the Cultural and Educational Section, Yang, scolded him and then sternly rebuked him, saying, don't you understand the significance of labor education?

Tan Zheng had no choice but to write a letter to the People's Daily editorial department, requesting help in solving the problem.

What do you think the Xiangtan Special District Cultural and Educational Section answered the People's Daily editorial department?

The reply said: Tan Zheng has a facial deformity, leukoma on the cornea of his left eye, and is nearsighted in his right eye; because of his ugly face and inelegant demeanor, although his exam results meet the admission standards, his physical condition does not meet the principle of selecting the best... therefore, he was not admitted...

Then it went on to say: "The school's disgust for his physical defects and excessive pickiness in selection are the main reasons, and our department must also be responsible for not carefully reviewing..."

People are dissatisfied with this answer. People solemnly ask: Why can't people with inelegant demeanor study?

Why should we treat students' misfortunes with disgust?

Why do the heads of the Cultural and Educational Section and the principals, who bear the heavy responsibility of cultivating the next generation of the motherland, distort the selection criteria of "both moral integrity and talent, and a sound physique" into "inelegant demeanor... does not meet the principle of selecting the best"?

This question should be answered by Xiangtan City Middle School and the Xiangtan Special District Cultural and Educational Section.

    颜面和仪表是录取学生的标准吗？
    在湖南湘潭市十七总后街流水沟二号，住着一个勤苦好学的少年，他的名字叫谭正。
    一九五四年夏季，谭正在湘潭市中学初中部毕业了。他的各科成绩是优等，品行鉴定是甲等，这个品学兼优的少年受到了多少人的称赞啊！
    暑期，学校开始招生了，谭正参加了湘潭市中学高中入学考试。考试的那一天，他很顺利地就结束了各科试卷。考试的结果，他却落选了。
    谭正在接到学校通知时，沉重地感到失望和痛苦，他几乎疑惑自己的眼睛发生了错觉。
    谭正来到学校办公室，校长马上就把他推给了教导主任；谭正向教导主任提出了许多问题，静候着对方的回答。办公室内像死样的沉寂，有的在随便翻阅书报，有的伏案打盹，有的借口上厕所溜走了。
    过了好久，有一位叫李杰夫的老师出人意外地发问了：
      “你有胃病吗？”
      “没有！”谭正斩钉截铁地回答着。
    “那末，你胸腔一定有毛病。”
    谭正正要辩解，李老师忽而又装出异乎寻常的亲切的口吻说：“我们了解你，我们也非常同情你……。”“老实说吧：你是个好同学，就是因为你的颜面和仪表有点……不……大……那……个。”
    亲切的语言随着亲切的目光向谭正扫射过来。
    “其实何必一定要上学呢？学裁缝不也是同样地可以为祖国为人民服务吗？”
    “高尔基、吴运铎不也是勤学苦练的吗？”接着办公室的人们纷纷议论着。“像这样的仪表，将来读大学那不是笑话吗？这对我们学校的观瞻来说，也是不大雅观的呀？”
    谭正很气愤，他清楚地记得一个骨瘦如柴面容苍白的同学录取了，这是一个患三期肺病经常吐血的人。怎么他能录取，我却名落孙山呢。于是，他又去找湘潭专署文教科，满心希望文教科出来纠正偏向。文教科的杨科长把他训斥了一顿之后，又狠狠地责怪他说，你难道不懂得劳动教育的意义吗？
    谭正不得已就写信给人民日报编辑部，请求帮助解决。
    你想，湘潭专署文教科怎样答复人民日报编辑部呢！
    答复说：谭正颜面畸形，左眼角膜有白翳，右眼近视；因颜面丑陋，仪表不雅，考试成绩虽符录取标准，而身体条件却不符择优原则，……故未予录取……。
    接着又说：“学校对他身体上的缺陷存在厌恶情绪，和选择时过于挑剔是主要原因，我科未仔细审查也要负责。……”
    人们对于这种回答是不满意的，人们严正地问道：为什么仪表不雅的人，就不可以学习呢？
    为什么要用厌恶的情绪对待学生的不幸呢？
    为什么文教科长和校长们，身负培养祖国后一代的重任，对
  “德才兼备、体魄健全”的选择标准却歪曲成为“仪表不雅，……不符择优原则”呢？
    这个问题，应由湘潭市中学和湘潭专署文教科来作答。
