Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 22nd: According to the Vietnam News Agency, the Lao Free National United Front's official newspaper, "Liberation," published a commentary on February 20th entitled "Resolutely Oppose the American Conspiracy to Drag Laos into the Aggressive Southeast Asia Group," exposing the attempt by American imperialism and its lackeys to turn Laos into an American military base.

"Liberation" recounted that the Thai government, acting on American orders, sent a military delegation to inspect many strategic locations in Laos in early February. "Liberation" pointed out that after the Thai delegation's "visit," Lao Kingdom Prime Minister Kat Sasorith told the press:
“Not only Laos, but all other Southeast Asian countries are also related to the Southeast Asia Group.”

"Liberation" pointed out: Prime Minister Kat's above statement is completely contrary to the terms of the Geneva Accords and the statement of the Kingdom government delegation attending the Plain of Jars political conference. It violates the wishes of the Lao people and peace-loving people all over the world. This statement by the Prime Minister of Laos intentionally or unintentionally implies recognition of the aggressive Southeast Asia Group manipulated by American imperialism, and conforms to the American imperialists' conspiracy to drag Laos into this military group.

"Liberation" said: The peace-loving people of Laos earnestly respect the Geneva armistice agreement, but have never recognized the aggressive Southeast Asia Group. They resolutely protest the American conspiracy to drag Laos into this group.

Xinhua News Agency, Wellington, February 23rd: News from Wellington: The New Zealand "People's Voice" published a commentary on February 16th condemning the Manila Treaty countries' Bangkok conference, saying that the conference was a meeting of warmongers who wanted to plot the best way to slaughter the Asian people who are fighting for their national freedom.

The commentary said, "Britain, the United States, and France are the driving forces in the alliance. They joined the alliance to protect the tools of Western shareholders who plunder the Asian people—plantations, mines, factories, and warehouses."

The commentary denounced the Manila Treaty countries' pretext of so-called "communist aggression," saying, "There is no threat of 'communist aggression' from any foreign country in any region. However, in many Asian countries, there is a similar situation, that is, the people of those countries suffer from hunger, poverty, disease, and illiteracy under the rule of European rulers. They are uniting to fight for their national freedom, or they have already won freedom and are moving towards a prosperous life."

The commentary pointed out that the people of Asian countries unanimously condemn the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization as an aggressive group that threatens Asian peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 23rd: The Czechoslovak "Youth Front Daily" published a commentary on the 22nd denouncing the Bangkok conference, saying that the Bangkok conference of member states of the Manila Treaty Organization is a threat to the independence and peace of Asian countries. The commentary said that American imperialists are trying to use this conference to force the member states of the Manila Treaty Organization to support American adventures in the Far East and undermine the upcoming Asian-African Conference. The commentary pointed out, however, that the Asian-African Conference will speak decisive words in favor of freedom and peace.

    各国舆论谴责威胁亚洲和平的曼谷会议
    寮国“解放报”说
    反对美国阴谋把老挝拖入东南亚集团
    【新华社二十三日讯】　据越南通讯社河内二十二日讯：寮国自由民族统一战线机关报“解放报”在二月二十日以“坚决反对美国阴谋把老挝拖入侵略性的东南亚集团”为题发表评论，揭露美帝国主义和它的仆从企图把老挝变成美国的军事基地。
      “解放报”追述，泰国政府奉美国的命令，在二月初派遣了一个军事使团到老挝的许多战略地点进行视察。“解放报”指出，在泰国使团“访问”之后，老挝王国首相克特·萨索里斯向报界说：
  “不仅是老挝，所有其他的东南亚国家也都是和东南亚集团相联系的。”
    “解放报”指出：克特首相的上述声明，是和日内瓦协定的条款以及出席查尔平原政治会议的王国政府代表团的声明完全背道而驰的。它违反了老挝人民和全世界爱好和平的人民的愿望。老挝首相发表的这个声明有意无意地意味着对美帝国主义操纵的侵略性东南亚集团的承认，并且符合于美帝国主义者把老挝拖入这个军事集团的阴谋。
      “解放报”说：爱好和平的老挝人民认真地尊重日内瓦停战协定，但是从来不承认侵略性的东南亚集团。他们坚决抗议美国把老挝拖入这个集团的阴谋。
    新西兰“人民之声报”说
    曼谷会议是好战头子们的一次会议
    【新华社二十三日讯】　惠灵顿消息：新西兰
  “人民之声报”二月十六日发表评论谴责马尼拉条约国家的曼谷会议说，这次会议是好战头子们的一次会议，他们要策划最好的办法来屠杀那些为自己的民族自由而奋斗的亚洲人民。
    评论说，“英国、美国和法国是联盟中的动力。它们加入联盟是为了保护西方股东们掠夺亚洲人民的工具——种植园、矿山、工厂和仓库。”
    评论斥责马尼拉条约国家的所谓“共产主义侵略”的借口说，“并没有来自任何一个地区任何一个外国的‘共产主义侵略’威胁。但是，在很多亚洲国家内有一个情况倒是一样的，就是那些国家的人民在欧洲统治者的统治下遭受到饥饿、贫困、疾病和文盲的痛苦。他们正在团结起来为争取他们的民族自由而斗争，或者他们已经赢得了自由，正在朝着一个富裕的生活前进。”
    评论指出，亚洲国家的人民一致谴责东南亚条约组织，认为这是一个威胁亚洲和平的侵略集团。
    捷克斯洛伐克“青年阵线报”说
    曼谷会议威胁亚洲国家的独立和和平
    【新华社布拉格二十三日电】　捷克斯洛伐克
  “青年阵线报”二十二日发表评论斥责曼谷会议说，马尼拉条约组织成员国的曼谷会议是对亚洲国家的独立和和平的威胁。评论说，美帝国主义者企图利用这次会议迫使马尼拉条约组织的成员国支持美国在远东的冒险行动，并且破坏即将举行的亚非会议。评论指出，但是，亚非会议将说出有利于自由和和平的决定性的话来。
