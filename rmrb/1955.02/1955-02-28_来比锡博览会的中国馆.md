(Xinhua News Agency, Leipzig, 27th) The 1955 Spring Leipzig International Fair officially opened on the 27th. This is the fifth time that the People's Republic of China has participated in this fair.

    The Chinese Pavilion at the fair is located in the permanent technical exhibition area in the suburbs of Leipzig, covering an area of 5,000 square meters. The architecture and decoration of the Chinese Pavilion are rich in national characteristics. China is exhibiting more than 2,900 kinds of exhibits this year, an increase of 26 percent over last year. These exhibits show the outline of the rapid development of China's socialist industrialization and the Chinese people's infinite confidence in building their motherland.

    Entering the Chinese Pavilion, you can see a full-length statue of Chairman Mao Zedong. On the central wall is a passage excerpted from Chairman Mao's opening speech at the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China last September. It shows that 600 million people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, are confidently striving to build a great socialist country. On the opposite wall hangs a huge picture of the meeting between the Premiers of China and Germany, Zhou Enlai and Grotewohl.

    The right half of the exhibition hall displays new products of China's machine-building industry. This year's exhibits include various steel products produced by Anshan Iron and Steel, various highly efficient machine tools, 60-horsepower mobile air compressors with diesel engines, 90-horsepower vertical diesel engines, various mining machines, high-precision ball bearings of various types required for precision machinery manufacturing, and new textile machines.

    The left half of the exhibition hall displays light industrial products and daily necessities that meet the ever-increasing living standards of the people, as well as agricultural and local products with huge export potential. Colorful silks and gorgeous carpets are hung here. China's famous porcelain, handicrafts, furniture, musical instruments, radios, and other items are comprehensively displayed in specially arranged small living rooms in the pavilion. Our rich agricultural products are displayed on counters set against a background rich in the flavor of southern China. The middle and rear parts of the exhibition hall display tobacco, wine, canned food, candy, and other food products.

    In the open-air plaza outside the pavilion, various new agricultural tools are exhibited, which are manufactured to meet the characteristics of my country's current stage of agricultural economic development and to cooperate with the rapidly developing collectivization movement in the vast rural areas. These include five-share plows, seeders, and various animal-drawn improved agricultural tools for plowing, harrowing, sowing, cultivating, and harvesting.
