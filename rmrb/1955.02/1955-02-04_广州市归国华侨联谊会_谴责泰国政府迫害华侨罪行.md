Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, February 2nd: The Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Federation has received letters from refugee overseas Chinese who were unreasonably imprisoned by the Thai government, accusing the Thai government of abuse. The letter stated: "The prison cells we live in are so small that lying down is like stacking sardines, and we cannot sleep all night; we eat rice mixed with sand and rotten fish and vegetables; the weather is hot, there is no water to shower, and we lack medicine when we are sick. Several refugee overseas Chinese have died in prison."

The Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Federation learned from relevant sources that these persecuted refugee overseas Chinese were part of a group of more than two hundred whom the Thai government unreasonably decided to deport last year. On September 30th of last year, the Thai government officially notified the Thai Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to contact the relevant authorities in Shantou to arrange for their entry. On November 4, 1954, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government received a telegram from the Shantou Municipal People's Government Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau forwarded from the Thai Chinese General Chamber of Commerce requesting permission to enter the country. On the 8th of the same month, it directly telegraphed the Thai Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, agreeing that this group of refugee overseas Chinese could enter through Shantou. However, several months have passed, and the refugee overseas Chinese are still being imprisoned. Chiang Kai-shek elements in Thailand deliberately spread rumors, saying that our government did not reply and refused to allow the refugee overseas Chinese to return to China, etc.

The person in charge of the Guangzhou Overseas Chinese Federation stated that the Thai government's barbaric measures to persecute overseas Chinese have aroused the indignation of the people of the whole country.

    广州市归国华侨联谊会
    谴责泰国政府迫害华侨罪行
   【新华社广州二日电】广州市归国华侨联谊会接到被泰国政府无理监禁的难侨来信，控诉泰国政府的虐待罪行。来信说：“我们住的监房是那么狭小，躺下来像叠沙丁鱼，通宵不能安睡；吃的是掺着沙土的饭和臭鱼烂菜；天气酷热，无水冲凉，病了缺乏医药，有数位难侨已病死狱中。”
    广州市归国华侨联谊会从有关方面获悉，这些被迫害的难侨，是去年泰国政府无理决定驱逐出境的二百多名一批，泰国政府在去年九月三十日正式通知泰国中华总商会向汕头有关方面接洽入境，我广东省人民政府华侨事务委员会在一九五四年十一月四日接到由汕头市人民政府华侨事务局转来泰国中华总商会要求准许入境的来电，同月八日即直接电复泰国中华总商会，同意这批难侨由汕头入境。但已过了几个月，难侨们仍被监禁着。在泰国的蒋贼分子故意造谣，说我政府没有复电，拒绝难侨回国等等。
    广州市归国华侨联谊会负责人表示：泰国政府这种蛮横迫害华侨的措施，引起了全国人民的愤慨。
