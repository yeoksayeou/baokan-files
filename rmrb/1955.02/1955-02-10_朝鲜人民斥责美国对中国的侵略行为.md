Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: The aggressive actions of the American imperialists against the People's Republic of China have aroused great anger among the people of Korea.

Academician Zhang Zhouyi of the Academy of Sciences said on this issue: "We firmly advocate that the American imperialists withdraw from Taiwan. Only by stopping American interference in China's internal affairs and withdrawing American troops from Taiwan and other Chinese islands can the current tense situation in the Far East be eased."

He emphasized: "The Korean people, together with peace-loving people all over the world, fully support the Soviet Union's proposal in the United Nations Security Council to stop American aggression in the Taiwan Strait. The United Nations must, in accordance with the demands of people all over the world, adopt the Soviet Union's proposal to stop American aggression."

Quan Xingqi (transliteration), a worker at the Pyongyang Textile Factory who, with the help of Chinese technicians, exceeded the January production target by 37 percent, said: "The fraternal Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is a legitimate exercise of their sovereignty, and therefore, no foreign interference is allowed." He said: "We fully support the great task of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, drive out the American imperialist occupiers and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang from Taiwan in order to consolidate Asian peace and defend sovereignty and territorial integrity; at the same time, we strongly condemn the American imperialists' aggression against China."

Meritorious actress Lin Suxiang pointed out that the purpose of the so-called "ceasefire" proposal put forward by New Zealand is to attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs, split China's territory, and cover up the notorious aggression of the United States against China under the guise of the United Nations flag. We all know that the American imperialists have been using the United Nations to achieve their aggressive purposes. We denounce this conspiracy of the American imperialists with extreme anger.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 9th: The Korean Central News Agency published a statement on the 8th by Zheng Shengyan, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the North Korean Democratic Party, condemning the US aggression against the People's Republic of China. Zheng Shengyan said: Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are an inalienable part of China's territory. This is a serious fact, and the United States has no right to interfere in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. The "ceasefire" conspiracy instigated by the United States through the United Nations aims to obstruct the just struggle of the 600 million Chinese people to liberate Taiwan.

Zheng Shengyan said: We fully support the Soviet Union's proposal in the United Nations Security Council. The United Nations should, in accordance with the Soviet Union's proposal, condemn the United States' aggressive actions against the Chinese people and immediately stop the United States' interference in China's internal affairs. Only in this way can the serious situation created in the Taiwan area be eliminated and the tense situation in the Far East be eased.

    朝鲜人民斥责美国对中国的侵略行为
    【新华社平壤讯】据朝鲜中央通讯社八日讯：美帝国主义者对中华人民共和国的侵略行动已经引起了朝鲜全国人民的极大的愤怒。
    科学院的通讯院士张周益就这个问题发表谈话说：“我们坚决主张美帝国主义者撤出台湾。只有在制止美国干涉中国内政并且使美国部队撤出台湾和其他中国岛屿以后，目前远东的紧张局势才能得到缓和。”
    他强调说：“朝鲜人民和全世界爱好和平的人们一起，完全支持苏联在联合国安全理事会上所提出的关于制止美国在台湾海峡的侵略行为的建议。联合国必须依照全世界人民的要求，采纳苏联的建议，来制止美国的侵略行动。”
    在中国技术人员的帮助下超额百分之三十七完成一月份生产指标的平壤纺织工厂的工人全星七（译音）说：“兄弟般的中国人民的解放台湾的斗争，是合法地行使他们的主权，因此，决不允许外国干涉。”他说：“我们完全支持中国人民解放台湾、把美帝国主义占领者和蒋介石匪帮赶出台湾以巩固亚洲和平及保卫主权和领土完整的伟大任务；同时，我们强烈斥责美帝国主义者对中国的侵略行为。”
    功勋演员林素香指出，新西兰提出的所谓“停火”建议的目的是企图在联合国旗帜的掩饰下干涉中国的内政，分裂中国的领土和掩盖美国对中国的罪恶昭彰的侵略行为。我们大家都知道，美帝国主义者一直在利用联合国来达到他的侵略目的。我们怀着极端愤怒的心情斥责美帝国主义者的这种阴谋。
    【新华社平壤九日电】朝鲜中央通讯社八日发表北朝鲜民主党中央委员会副委员长郑圣彦的谈话，谴责美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为。郑圣彦说：台湾和澎湖是中国的不可分割的领土，这是严肃的事实，美国没有任何权利干涉中国人民解放台湾。美国通过联合国策动的“停火”阴谋，目的在于阻挠六亿中国人民解放台湾的正义斗争。
    郑圣彦说：我们完全支持苏联在联合国安全理事会上的建议。联合国应该按照苏联的建议，谴责美国对中国人民的侵略行为，并且立即制止美国对中国内政的干涉。只有这样，才能消除在台湾地区所造成的严重局势，并和缓远东的紧张局势。
