Assembled Houses
　　By Li He, our correspondent in Moscow

New things constantly appear in Soviet life. These new things are quickly valued, supported, and promoted. In the face of new things, an infinitely broad road always unfolds. The initiatives of production innovators, automatic continuous devices in machine manufacturing, the Maltsev method in cultivation, and the assembly of houses using prefabricated reinforced concrete structures and components in construction all belong to this category.

On a recent freezing day, we saw how to build houses using prefabricated reinforced concrete structures and components manufactured in factories.

New buildings in Moscow are increasing year by year. New houses are appearing everywhere on Gorky Street, Leningrad Avenue, First Mi Xiangsk Street, Yaroslavsky Avenue, the Sadovoye Ring Road, the Moscow River embankment, the southwestern district, and other streets. Some of them are harmoniously inserted among the original houses, while others form new streets themselves. Moscow residents received 910,000 square meters of living space in 1954 alone (excluding corridors, kitchens, and bathrooms). Walking on the wide streets, you will always see new eight-story or even higher buildings catching your eye. But if you see them after construction is completed instead of during construction, you will not be able to distinguish which ones are assembled with prefabricated structures and components.

We arrived at Bischanxue Street. On both sides of the flat street, eight-story buildings are lined up one after another. On the lower floors of these multi-story residences, new food stores, daily necessities stores, and cinemas have been opened, and a new street garden with initial scale is covered with white snow. This is a young street in the northwest of Moscow. In the seventh section of this street, the framework of an eight-story building has already been erected to four stories. What a building! A completely new scene.

Four tower cranes and structures and components produced in factories surround the building. Structures and components made of reinforced concrete—walls, partitions, columns, beams—are neatly stacked. The rumbling cranes are busy lifting structure after structure and component after component, sending them to where they are needed, where installation workers are gesturing, directing the cranes, and accurately assembling these structures and components. Electric welders are welding the joints and seams of the assembled structures and components. The electric welders in their hands shone with a blue light. The workers first assemble the framework of the building with prefabricated reinforced concrete columns and beams. The two-story high columns are thirty by forty centimeters thick. The beams are sixteen by sixty centimeters thick. Then, huge prefabricated reinforced concrete wall blocks, partition blocks, roof blocks, etc., are inlaid on the framework. The wall blocks are about thirty centimeters thick. The construction site is very clean, because there is no need to build formwork, no need to mix concrete slurry; because gas pipes, water pipes, electric wires, etc. have been pre-installed inside the wall blocks and partition blocks prepared by the factory. Once they are assembled, only finishing work remains. The upper floors of this building are still under construction, and the lower floors have already been installed with glass. The window frames are also prefabricated with reinforced concrete, with sills, and wooden windows are installed after installation. We climbed to the fourth floor on the stairs. The stairs are also prefabricated structures and components made of reinforced concrete. On the fourth floor, we saw that each floor is divided into three parts, very large; behind this building, three identical buildings are being assembled. A fifth one will be assembled soon. According to the engineer, the first building was assembled with 16,500 structures and components; when assembling the first floor, due to lack of experience, it took two months; the second floor only took one month. On the day we arrived, only 276 people were working on the four buildings under construction on the entire construction site using the flow-line method.

Leaving Bischanxue Street, we arrived at the adjacent Sixth Street of October Fields. Here, according to the design of the Institute of Building Technology of the Soviet Academy of Architecture, Moscow's first frameless house assembled with large prefabricated reinforced concrete walls is being built. Construction workers from Moscow and all over the Soviet Union are constantly coming here to visit. This seven-story building will have 3,600 square meters of living space. The slag concrete wall blocks used for the exterior walls are 40 centimeters thick, 3.3 meters high (i.e., one story high), 3.6 meters wide, and weigh 5 tons. The outside of the wall block has a decorative concrete surface layer, and the inside only needs to be filled with putty to fill the gaps and paint, without any other processing. The partition blocks used inside the house are 14 centimeters thick, and the height is the same as the wall blocks. The longitudinal wall is 3.6 meters wide, and the transverse wall is 6.4 meters wide. The structures and components are transported from the factory by special vehicles with a load capacity of 15 tons. This frameless house has only been built to two stories, and the first floor is already habitable. The entire construction project is carried out by only one group of five people. With the help of a crane, the installation workers quickly assembled the large walls, partitions, roofs, stairs and other structures and components that are one story high.

Is this method of building with reinforced concrete structures and components, with or without a frame, better? Comrade Khrushchev said at the All-Soviet Construction Workers Conference: There is no need to make a conclusion for the time being. Both need to be developed, and practice will prove which one is more practical.

Last year, Moscow used reinforced concrete structures and components to build schools in three places. According to calculations, a five-story school can be assembled in just 70 to 100 days. Last year, the Voroshilov Collective Farm in Ukhtom District, Moscow Oblast, used prefabricated structures and components to build houses, cowsheds, feed towers, greenhouses and hotbeds.

In front of this building assembled with prefabricated structures and components, two scenes cannot help but appear in your mind:

First, the scene of the assembly workshop of the Soviet Automobile Factory. There, workers on the conveyor assemble the various parts of the car produced by the factory into a complete car, producing one every few minutes. The parts of the entire building in front of us, such as wall blocks, partition blocks, roof panels, columns, beams, stairs, etc., are all produced on a large scale by building materials factories, just as all the parts of automobiles are produced on a large scale by automobile factories. In this way, building houses and other buildings will, like assembling cars and other machines, begin to embark on the road of complete industrialization.

Second, the scene of ordinary construction sites using reinforced concrete. Usually, steelworkers and electric welders first build and weld the steel frame of the future building, and then carpenters build formwork around the frame, and then concrete workers pour concrete slurry into it. It takes two or three weeks to wait for the concrete to set before removing the formwork. Compared with the ordinary construction method, the construction method of assembling reinforced concrete structures and components in front of us saves many times the manpower, time and materials, and can be carried out without hindrance in winter.

Since the All-Soviet Construction Workers Conference, industrialized construction has been advancing rapidly in the Soviet Union. Many factories manufacturing reinforced concrete structures and components are under construction. Buildings assembled with prefabricated structures and components are increasing. Not only houses and factories, but also rural production buildings, roads and bridges will be built using this industrialized method. The industrialization of construction is the guarantee for the successful implementation of large-scale capital construction in the Soviet Union.

Under the guidance of Soviet experts, our country has also begun to implement the method of prefabricating building structures and components and mechanizing construction on some key construction projects. In order to increase construction speed, improve construction quality, and reduce construction costs, we need to learn new Soviet experiences in industrialized construction with greater attention.

    装配的房屋
    本报驻莫斯科记者　李何
    苏联生活中不断出现新的事物。这些新事物很快地受到重视、支持和推广。在新事物面前总是展开无限广阔的道路。生产革新者的创举，机器制造业中的自动连续装置，耕作中的马尔采夫方法，建筑中用预制的钢筋混凝土结构和配件装配房屋，都属于这一类。
    在最近一个严寒的日子，我们看了怎样用工厂预先制造的钢筋混凝土的结构和配件来建筑房屋。
    莫斯科的新建筑物一年比一年增加。在高尔基大街、列宁格勒大道、第一米向斯克大街、雅罗斯拉夫斯基大道、沙多沃环行道、莫斯科河岸、市西南区以及其他街道上，到处出现新的房屋。它们有的十分协调地插在原有的房屋中间，有的自己组成新的街道。莫斯科居民仅仅在一九五四年一年内就得到了九十一万平方公尺居住面积（不包括过道、厨房、卫生间的面积）。走在宽阔的街道上，总有八层楼或者更高的新房屋映进你的眼帘。但是如果不是在建筑当中而是在建筑完成以后见到它们，那你会无法辨别哪些是用预制的结构和配件装配的。
    我们到了比斯昌雪街。在平坦的街道两旁，一座又一座排列着八层楼房。在这些多层楼住宅的下层，开设有新的食品店、日用品店、电影院，初具规模的新的街心花园披盖着白雪。这是莫斯科西北面一条年青的街道。在这条街的第七段，一座八层楼已经建筑起四层骨架。这是怎样的建筑呵！完全新颖的景象。
    四架塔状起重机和在工厂中生产的结构和配件围绕着建筑物。钢筋混凝土制成的结构和配件——墙、壁、柱、梁，整齐地堆放着。隆隆响着的起重机忙碌地吊起一个又一个结构和配件，把它们送到需要的地方去，在那儿，安装工人做着手势，指挥着起重机，把这些结构和配件准确地装配起来。电焊工人焊接着装配好了的结构和配件的接头和接缝。他们手里的电焊机青光四射。工人们先用预制的钢筋混凝土的柱和梁，装配好楼房的骨架。两层楼高的柱，有三十乘四十公分粗。梁有十六乘六十公分粗。然后在骨架上镶放庞大的预制的钢筋混凝土的墙块、壁块、顶块等等。墙块厚到三十公分左右。工地内外显得非常干净，因为在这儿用不着构搭板模，用不着和灌混凝土浆；因为瓦斯管、水管、电线等等都已经预装在工厂准备的墙块、壁块内面。它们装配好了，剩下来的只有修饰的工作。这座楼房的上层还在进行建筑，下层已经安装了玻璃。窗框也是用钢筋混凝土预制的，带着窗台，装好后再放上木质的窗子。我们踏着楼梯登上四楼。楼梯也是用钢筋混凝土预制的结构和配件。在四楼上，我们看到每层分三个部分，很大；在这座房屋后面，正装配着三座同样的房屋。不久还要装配第五座。据工程师说，第一座建筑物用一万六千五百件结构和配件装配；装配第一层时候，缺乏经验，花了两个月；第二层只花一个月。我们到那儿的一天，全部工地上以流水作业法建筑的四座房屋，只用二百七十六个人工作。
    离开了比斯昌雪街，我们到了邻近的十月田地第六大街。这儿按照苏联建筑科学院建筑技术研究所的设计，正在建筑莫斯科第一座用大块预制的钢筋混凝土墙壁装配的无骨架的房屋。莫斯科和苏联各地建筑工作者不断地来到这儿参观。这座七层楼将有三千六百平方公尺居住面积。外墙所用的钢渣混凝土的墙块，厚四十公分，高三点三公尺（即一层楼高），宽三点六公尺，重五吨。墙块的外面有装饰用的混凝土的表层，里面只要用油灰填塞缝隙和油漆，不用别的加工。房屋内部所用的壁块，厚十四公分，高度和墙块相等，纵壁宽三点六公尺，横壁宽六点四公尺。结构和配件由十五吨载重的专门汽车从工厂运来。这座不用骨架的房屋，才盖了两层，第一层已经可以住人了。全部建筑工程只用一组五个人进行。在起重机的帮助下，安装工人敏捷地把一层楼高的大块墙、壁和顶、楼梯等等结构和配件装配起来。
    这种用钢筋混凝土结构和配件装配的建筑方法，是有骨架的好，还是没有骨架的好呢？赫鲁晓夫同志在全苏联建筑工作者会议上说：暂且不必作出定论，两者都需要发展，实践将证明那一种更实用。
    莫斯科去年有三个地方用钢筋混凝土的结构和配件建筑了学校。据计算，五层楼的学校，只要七十天到一百天就可以装配完毕。莫斯科州乌赫托姆区伏罗希洛夫集体农庄去年用预制的结构和配件建筑了住宅、牛舍、饲料塔、温室和温床。
    在这种用预制的结构和配件装配的建筑物面前，你的脑子里不能不浮现两幅景象：
    第一，苏联汽车制造厂装配间的景象。在那里，工人们在传送装置上把工厂生产的汽车各部分最后装配成整辆汽车，几分钟出产一辆。我们面前的这些墙块、壁块、顶板、柱、梁、楼梯等等全部建筑物的零件，没有一件不是由建筑材料工厂大规模地生产的，就像汽车的全部零件没有一件不是由汽车制造厂大规模地生产的一样。这样，盖造房屋和其他建筑物，将像装配汽车和其他机器一样，开始走上完全工业化的道路。
    第二，平常工地上钢筋混凝土建筑的景象。平常，先由钢骨工人和电焊工人搭好焊好未来建筑物的钢铁骨架，接着木工在骨架周围搭好板模，然后混凝土工人朝那里浇灌混凝土浆。需要两三个星期等待混凝土定型，再拆掉板模。我们面前用钢筋混凝土结构和配件装配的建筑方法，比起平常那种建筑方法，节省许多倍人力、时间和材料，在冬天也可以毫无阻碍地施工。
    自从全苏联建筑工作者会议以后，工业化的建筑，在苏联正以迅速的步伐前进着。许多制造钢筋混凝土结构和配件的工厂在建设。用预制的结构和配件装配的建筑物在增加。不单住宅、厂房，而且农村生产建筑物、道路、桥梁都将使用这种工业化的方法建筑。建筑的工业化，是苏联大规模的基本建设成功地进行的保证。
    我国在苏联专家的指导之下，在一些重点建设工程上，也开始实行建筑结构和配件预制和机械化施工方法。为了增加建设速度，提高建设质量，降低建设成本，我们需要以更大的注意力学习苏联工业化建筑的新经验。  一月二十日（附图片）
    在莫斯科和苏联其他城市里，正在建筑骨架预制板房屋，这种房屋是用在工厂里预先做好的混凝土和钢筋混凝土配件装配起来的。莫斯科比斯昌雷街上正在建筑骨架预制板房屋。
