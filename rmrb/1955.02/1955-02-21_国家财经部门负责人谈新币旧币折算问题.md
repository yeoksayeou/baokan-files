Xinhua News Agency, February 21st – A responsible person from the National Financial Department discussed the issue of converting new and old currencies.

The State Council's order on issuing the new Renminbi and recalling the current Renminbi stipulates that from March 1st, the new currency shall become the sole unit of calculation. Xinhua News Agency reporters interviewed the responsible persons of the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Finance, and the People's Bank of China regarding the conversion of new and old currencies. They discussed some noteworthy issues in this regard.

Regarding the conversion of commodity prices: After the issuance of the new currency starting March 1st, the old currency prices of various commodities on the market, regardless of whether they are state-owned, cooperative-operated, joint state-private, or privately-owned enterprises, shall be converted into new currency prices according to the legal new-old currency conversion rate. Upward adjustments or downward rounding are not allowed. For example, if a jin (catty, about 500g) of flour costs 1,840 old yuan, it should be converted to 1 jiao 8 fen 4 li in new currency; if a jin of corn costs 945 old yuan, it should be converted to 9 fen 4 li 5 hao in new currency. When settling each transaction, in order to solve the difficulty of making change, the past method of providing change in kind can still be adopted. Private industrial and commercial enterprises should also follow this method.

Regarding the handling of creditor and debtor relationships: All public-private enterprises, state organs, organizations, or urban deposit account holders who have business relationships with banks, whether deposits or loans, will have their accounts converted by the bank according to the new-old currency ratio and issued as statements. The units or individuals should check and verify the statements and return them to the bank without having to personally go to the bank to complete the procedures. Debtor-creditor business relationships between units, between public-private enterprises, and between private enterprises should be converted from old currency to new currency into new accounts by the end of February. At the same time, the creditor should issue a statement of account, which should be checked and signed by both parties to avoid errors or other disputes. As for the transfer method, the Ministry of Finance has regulations for state-owned enterprises and cooperative enterprises, and private enterprises can refer to them.

Government bonds, agricultural loan receipts, and personal savings in banks do not need to go to the bank to complete the conversion procedures. The bank will convert them on their behalf, and payment will be made in new currency upon maturity. Credit cooperatives will adopt the same method to handle deposits and loans.

Regarding foreign exchange: Foreign exchange rates will be converted to new currency rates according to the new-old currency conversion ratio. Remittances from overseas Chinese after March 1st will be paid domestically according to the new currency exchange rate. Investments and government bonds purchased by overseas Chinese in China will be handled according to domestic methods.

Regarding account books, contracts, agreements, vouchers, etc., after March 1st, the following methods will be adopted for handling past account books and vouchers:

If private enterprises do not have time to replace new account books, the old account books can still be used, but efforts should be made to ensure clarity and avoid errors.

If price vouchers used externally, such as train tickets and ship tickets, are not replaced, the old ones can also be used, but the original old currency should be converted into new currency.

All enterprise stocks, insurance premium receipts, IOUs, and other vouchers, as well as established contracts and agreements, that are denominated in old currency before the issuance of the new currency will remain valid, but the old currency needs to be converted into new currency.

    国家财经部门负责人谈新币旧币折算问题
    【新华社二十一日讯】国务院关于发行新的人民币和收回现行的人民币的命令规定，自三月一日起，新币应成为唯一的计算单位。新华社记者就新旧币折算问题访问了中华人民共和国商业部、财政部和中国人民银行的负责人，他们就这方面谈了一些值得注意的问题。
    关于商品标价的折算问题：从三月一日开始发行新币后，市场上各种商品的旧币单位标价，不论国营、合作社营、公私合营、私营企业，一律按法定新旧币折算率折合为新币标价，不准上调或下舍。如面粉一斤旧币一千八百四十元，应折合为新币一角八分四厘，玉米一斤旧币九百四十五元，应折合为新币九分四厘五毫。每笔交易结算时，为解决找零的困难，仍可采用过去以实物找零办法。私营工商业也要按照此办法办理。
    债权债务处理问题：各公私企业、国家机关、团体或城市内使用支票的存款户，凡和银行有来往业务关系的，不论存款或放款，都由银行按新旧币比率折算开出对账单，各单位或个人接到对账单，经查对签证后退回银行，不必亲自往银行办理手续。各单位之间、公私企业之间、私营企业之间的债务债权业务关系，双方都应于二月底把旧币折成新币转入新账，同时由债权方发出对账单，经双方查对后签章证明，以免发生错误或其他纠纷。至于转账办法，财政部对国营企业、合作社企业有所规定，私营企业可参照办理。
    公债券、农业贷款借据以及个人在银行的储蓄，都不必到银行办理折算手续，由银行代为折算，到期按新币支付。信用合作社的存款放款采取同样办法处理。
    关于外汇：外汇牌价均按新旧币折合比率折成新币挂牌。三月一日以后的侨胞汇款在国内按照新币外汇牌价解付。侨胞在国内的投资和购买的公债都按国内办法处理。
    关于账簿、契约、合同、凭证等，三月一日后对过去的账簿、凭证采取以下办法处理：
    私营企业如来不及更换新账簿时，旧账簿仍可采用，但应力求清楚，避免错误。
    对外使用的计价凭证如车票、船票等如不改换，旧的也可使用，但应将原来的旧币折成新币。
    所有在新币发行前以旧币为单位的企业股票、保险费收据、借据等凭证及已经成立的契约、合同等都继续有效，但需把旧币折成新币。
