Properly Store the New Grain
    Kang Chong

    The grain purchase work that began in the second half of 1954 has basically concluded, and state warehouses in various regions are filled with large quantities of new grain. Properly storing this grain is a pressing task at present.

    The characteristics of this year's grain storage work are: the amount of grain purchased by the state has increased compared to the previous year; the time for transporting grain into warehouses is very concentrated (one to two months); and much of the new grain has a high moisture content. These situations indicate that this year's grain storage work is more difficult and arduous than in previous years.

    In order to properly store the new grain, state grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives in many regions have taken various effective measures, which is absolutely necessary. However, some state grain departments and supply and marketing cooperatives are not doing this. They do not conduct strict inspections before transporting grain into warehouses, and have accepted large quantities of substandard grain; they do not store grain separately according to different qualities when it enters the warehouse; and they do not promptly inspect and sun-dry the grain when it becomes hot, moldy, or infested with insects, causing great losses to the state. According to inspection statistics from nine counties and cities in Guangxi Province, 400 million jin of grain are infested with insects, and more than 300,000 jin have rotted. In Jiangxi Province, grain infested with insects accounts for 40 percent of the grain that has been inspected. In ten counties of Rehe Province, 400,000 jin of grain have become moldy and deteriorated. This situation deserves our serious attention.

    In order to protect grain, grain departments at all levels should strengthen leadership over grain storage work and conduct a general survey of grain depots in various regions. Through this survey, we can roughly ascertain the number of existing warehouses, the location of grain storage, and the amount of grain storage, which will facilitate future grain allocation and supply work. Moreover, we can ascertain the grain conditions, classify and rank warehouses and grain quality, and take appropriate measures based on different situations. For grain with high moisture content, high temperature, and severe insect infestation, timely ventilation, ditching, turning, sun-drying, and sifting should be carried out. The grain stored in small warehouses should be quickly merged in a planned and step-by-step manner. For grain in small warehouses that cannot be concentrated temporarily, special attention should be paid to preventing leakage and moisture.

    把新粮保管好
    康重
    从一九五四年下半年开始的粮食征购工作基本上结束了，各地国家仓库里盛满了大批新粮；保管好这批粮食，是当前一项迫切的任务。
    今年粮食保管工作的特点是：国家征购粮食的数量比上个年度增多了；运粮入库的时间很集中（一个月至两个月）许多新粮水分很大。这些情况说明今年粮食保管工作比往年更加困难艰巨。
    为了把新粮保管好，不少地区的国家粮食部门和供销合作社采取了各种有效的措施，这是非常必需的。但是，有些国家粮食部门和供销合作社却不是这样。他们在运粮入库前不进行严格检验，收进了大批的次粮；入库时也不按照不同质量分别保管；粮食发热、发霉、生虫时，也不及时检查翻晒，给国家造成很大损失。据广西省九个县、市的检查统计，生虫的粮食有四亿斤，霉烂的有三十余万斤。江西省生虫的粮食占已检查的粮食的百分之四十。热河省十个县发霉变质的粮食就有四十万斤。这种情况值得我们严重注意。
    为了保护粮食，各级粮食部门应加强粮食保管工作的领导，对各地粮库进行一次普查工作。经过这次普查，可以大体上摸清现有仓库的数目、存粮地点和存粮数目，便于以后进行粮食调运和供应工作。而且可以查清粮情，把仓库和粮质进行分类排队，根据不同情况，进行适当的处理。对于水分大、温度高、虫害严重的粮食，应及时通风、扒沟、翻晒、过筛。小仓库的存粮，应该迅速有计划有步骤地合并起来。对于暂时无法集中的小仓库中的粮食，要特别注意防漏、防潮工作。
