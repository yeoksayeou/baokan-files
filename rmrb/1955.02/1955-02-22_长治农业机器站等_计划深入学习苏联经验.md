    Changzhi Agricultural Machinery Station and others
    Plan to study Soviet experience in depth
    The Changzhi Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station and the China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm in Shanxi Province have drawn up plans to further study advanced Soviet experience.
    The Changzhi Tractor Station and the China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm have achieved great success in learning from advanced Soviet experience. The tractor station used the same number of tools last year and the year before, but the cultivation tasks completed last year were 27 percent more than the year before. Last year, two compound operations were promoted on more than 12,000 mu of land, which increased the efficiency of the machinery by 11 percent, saved more than 2,300 kilograms of fuel, and more than 1,000 man-days of labor. Due to learning from Soviet experience, the agricultural farm developed diversified production. Although it suffered from a severe drought last year, its total income still exceeded the previous year by 38 percent. In order to better learn from Soviet experience, they have formulated specific plans. It is determined that in the future, joint lectures on advanced Soviet experience will be held regularly, and organizations will be established to specifically guide this work.

    长治农业机器站等
    计划深入学习苏联经验
    山西省长治农业机器拖拉机站和中苏友好集体农庄订出进一步学习苏联先进经验的计划。
    长治拖拉机站和中苏友好集体农庄，在学习苏联先进经验方面已获得很大成就。拖拉机站去年和前年使用同样多的工具，去年完成的耕作任务却比前年多了百分之二十七。去年在一万二千多亩地中推广耕种两项复式作业，即提高机具效率百分之十一，节省油料两千三百多公斤，人畜工一千多个。农庄由于学习苏联经验，发展多样性生产，去年虽然遭受严重旱灾，总收入仍然超过前年百分之三十八。为了更好地学习苏联经验，他们已订出具体计划。确定今后将定期联合举行苏联先进经验讲座，并建立专门指导这一工作的组织。（培法、子勤、生路、金盾）
