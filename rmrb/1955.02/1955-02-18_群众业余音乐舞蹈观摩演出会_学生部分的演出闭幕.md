    Student Section Closes
    The student section of the Mass Amateur Music and Dance Performance Meeting closed on the 14th. Among the 200+ students and 93 programs from seven participating cities, 31 programs and their 90 performers received excellence awards, and 25 programs and their 62 performers received awards. Many vocal and instrumental programs also won awards.
    In recent years, the extracurricular cultural and artistic life of students in universities and middle schools across the country has become increasingly rich. Youth League organizations and schools in many places attach importance to cultural and artistic activities. Professional art groups in various places also often provide assistance to students. The students' performances were valued by artists in Beijing, who believe that this is a new force that cannot be ignored. Through this observation and performance meeting, representatives from various regions exchanged and studied experiences and methods on how to further correctly carry out extracurricular activities in the future.
    The closing ceremony was held on the 14th. Zhang Zhixiang, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, pointed out in his speech: The programs participating in the performance were all healthy and lively. In the future, schools should promote the development of small-scale, diverse, ethnic, and folk art forms, vigorously encourage the masses to create their own works, and request writers and artists to create more works suitable for the needs of workers and peasants and suitable for student performances; and require professional art groups in various places to strengthen guidance for mass amateur art activities. Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, cordially congratulated the student representatives on the success of the performance at the closing ceremony. The four sentences he asked the representatives to take back were: "Amateur art and literature should be well promoted; adhere to the principle of voluntariness, in various forms; be rich and colorful, and created by everyone; hold regular performances, let a hundred flowers bloom." Lin Liru, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, also gave the representatives a lot of encouragement in his speech.
    At the closing ceremony, the list of winning programs and winners was announced, and award flags and prizes were distributed. Comrade Hu Yaobang also conducted the entire representative body in singing the song "Ode to the Motherland." (Xinhua News Agency)
