    A New Type of Livestock Market
    Duan Quanfa, Li Zhao

    Luohe City, Henan Province, is located close to the Beijing-Hankou Railway, with convenient transportation and proximity to livestock producing areas. It is one of the most famous livestock distribution markets in the country. Livestock produced in provinces such as Anhui and Hubei, and prefectures such as Xuchang, Xinyang, and Nanyang in Henan Province, are mostly sold here. Farmers and merchants from provinces such as Shandong, Shaanxi, and Hebei come here to buy livestock.

    Before liberation and in the early days of liberation, speculative merchants often engaged in buying and selling practices, speculation, and harmed farmers in this livestock market. In October 1951, the Luohe City Supply and Marketing Cooperative established a Farmer Service Center in the livestock market, which severely打击 [dǎjī - strike, hit, attack] the speculative behavior of unscrupulous merchants. In August 1954, the Luohe City Livestock Market Management Committee was established; at the end of the year, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, based on local needs, completely took over the transactions of the livestock market. Since then, this livestock market has become a completely new type of market.

    The Farmer Service Center opened by the Supply and Marketing Cooperative has been warmly welcomed by farmers. Over the past three years, it has assisted farmers and merchants from various places in trading more than 538,500 head of livestock. In 1954 alone, Shaanxi Province bought back more than 7,000 large steers from here; Tangshan Prefecture in Hebei Province alone bought back more than 8,000 head of livestock. The exploitation of farmers through price suppression, price gouging, and "black market" deals has disappeared. To facilitate farmer transactions, the Farmer Service Center has established a canteen, transportation team, and breeding team, simplifying business procedures as much as possible. Many farmers say: Coming to the service center is like coming home.

    With the arrival of the spring plowing season, this livestock market is starting to become lively again. Farmers and livestock merchants from provinces such as Shandong, Hebei, and Shaanxi, and many counties within Henan Province, have already arrived in Luohe. Currently, there are more than 1,300 head of livestock entering the market every day, and about 500 are being transacted. In the past month, more than 8,000 head of livestock have been traded. The amount of livestock entering the market is still increasing daily.

    一个新型的牲畜市场
    段荃法　李昭
    河南省漯河市紧靠京汉铁路，交通便利，接近牲畜产地，是全国有名的牲畜集散市场之一。安徽、湖北等省和河南省许昌、信阳、南阳等专区产的牲畜多在此地出卖，山东、陕西、河北等省的农民和商人很多都到此地购买牲畜。
    解放以前和解放初期，投机商人经常在这个牲畜市场上买空卖空，投机倒把，坑害农民。一九五一年十月，漯河市供销合作社在牲畜市场上设立了一个农民服务所，才使奸商的投机行为受到严重打击。一九五四年八月，漯河市牲畜市场管理委员会成立；年底，供销合作社根据当地实际需要，完全掌握了牲畜市场的交易。从此，这个牲畜市场就变成一个完全新型的市场了。
    供销合作社开设的农民服务所受到农民热烈欢迎。三年来，它协助各地农民和商人交易牲畜五十三万八千五百多头。在一九五四年内，陕西省从这里买回大犍牛七千多头；河北省仅唐山专区就买回牲口八千多头。过去农民们受的压价抬价、吃“黑盘”等剥削都没有了。为了便利农民交易，农民服务所设立了食堂和运输组、饲养组等机构，尽量简化了业务手续。许多农民说：到了服务所，就像到了自己家里一样。
    随着春耕季节的到来，这个牲畜市场又开始热闹起来。山东、河北、陕西等省和河南省内许多县的农民和牲畜商人已经到达漯河。现在，每天上市牲畜有一千三百多头，成交的也有五百头左右。近一个月来，已经交易牲畜八千多头。牲畜上市量还在逐日增加。
