    Less Interference, More Leadership
    By our reporter Lü Jianzhong
    Due to the development of agricultural production and the implementation of the unified purchase policy for grain, oil, and cotton, farmers have more money in their hands than ever before. How should we guide farmers to find proper outlets for their money? How should we help farmers correctly arrange production and life? This is indeed a new problem faced by rural work cadres today.
    Some cadres are very uneasy about the money in the hands of farmers. When they see farmers spending some money on their lives, they rashly label it as "waste." As a result, the phenomenon of excessive interference in farmers' lives has occurred. Some cadres, like housekeepers, check what farmers have bought from the market; if a farmer buys a woolen garment or a package of snacks to visit relatives, they will question them. In some areas, five desks for supply and marketing, credit, savings, loan repayment, and contract signing are set up in front of the grain warehouse. As soon as a farmer selling grain crosses the threshold of the warehouse, they are surrounded by shouts: "Hey, deposit the money in the bank, don't take it back and waste it!" "Come on, quickly pay your share!"… Irritating the farmers, who say this is a "joint trial by five departments." Some agricultural production cooperatives simply refuse to distribute money to their members. One member, because his daughter was getting married, asked the cooperative director for a loan of 150,000 yuan. The director said: "Have a new-style wedding, don't waste money, put the collective first!" He only approved a loan of 20,000 yuan, which angered the member so much that he didn't want the money and didn't go to work in the fields.
    Of course, in today's rural areas, there are indeed some people who use the large amount of cash they receive after selling agricultural products collectively for extravagant eating and drinking, speculative business, and usury. This is certainly not right. We should educate them not to do this. Some comrades are afraid that farmers will waste their money, and they try to make farmers use their money to increase agricultural production and help national construction. This intention is also good. However, why does it often lead to the opposite result? This is mainly because they do not understand the farmers' minds and do not actively lead the farmers' economic life, but rigidly interfere. Here is a practical example.
    In Xibojian Village, a cotton-producing area in Anyang County, Henan Province, the cotton harvest was bountiful in 1954. Members of the village's ten agricultural production cooperatives were all joyfully looking forward to the distribution of profits, so they could arrange their lives. However, the cadres were afraid that the profits would be wasted by the members, so they issued an order: old members would not receive any profits, and the cooperative would deposit the money in the bank; new members would immediately invest the money they earned from selling cotton into the cooperative. The members' enthusiasm was immediately dampened, and they said: "What's the point of working then, if we can't control our own money!" "After working hard for a year, we can't even hold the money in our hands!" So no one accumulated fertilizer, and the women didn't go to the fields to pick cotton. New members saw that old members had to beg the director even for 10,000 yuan, and they were even less willing to invest their money in the cooperative. The cadres were originally afraid that the members would waste money, but some members wasted it even more. Some members clearly had money in their hands and didn't have much to spend, but now they were deliberately looking for reasons to spend money, repeatedly chasing after the cadres to borrow money. There were also dozens of members who went to buy coffin boards and bricks to build graves. More and more people went to small restaurants in the town. When the cooperative formulated production plans and implemented contract farming, requiring members to report their own workdays, no one was willing to report more. Niu Jifu only reported 70 workdays for the whole year. He said: "That's enough for me to eat. No matter how much I work, the money won't come to my hands!" Not only that, some members and people outside the cooperative even doubted the future of socialism. They said: "It's already so tight now. In socialist society, we'll have even less control over ourselves."
    The cadres of Xibojian Village felt that this was not right, so they held a meeting to examine their shortcomings and distributed the money that should have been distributed to the members. At the same time, they strengthened ideological education for the members, using concrete facts to show that the interests of the country, the interests of the cooperative, and the personal interests of the members were consistent; explaining that the cooperative must rely on everyone to operate well; explaining that last year, because the cooperative invested more, the cotton harvest was bountiful; explaining that everyone's money did not come easily and should be used thriftily and appropriately; and also explaining that as the cooperative increased production, the members' lives should also be appropriately improved. The cadres also told the members: the supply and marketing cooperative has already brought New Year's goods, everyone should go and buy some things to have a good Spring Festival.
    As a result, the members' minds were at ease, and the situation improved. In fact, how could the members be willing to spend their money recklessly? When they get the money they earned from their labor, they will think: "This year's effort was not in vain. This money did not come easily, and it cannot be spent recklessly." In this way, many people thought it over and over again and felt that it was better to deposit it in the cooperative. Those members who were clamoring for money all day long now don't want it anymore. Member Niu Guigui didn't ask for a loan, didn't build a grave, and father and son discussed how many workdays to report this year. The seventh cooperative, led by Township Chief Lu Desheng, distributed a total of 43.5 million yuan in dividends to new and old members. As a result, the members only kept 8 million yuan for daily and Spring Festival expenses, and the rest was still deposited in the cooperative. Members of all ten cooperatives in the village deposited a total of 700 million yuan in the bank and invested in the cooperatives, accounting for more than 80 percent of the dividends.
    Then, the cooperative mobilized the members to formulate production plans and implement contract farming. The members reported their workdays very enthusiastically. Niu Jifu, who originally only reported 70 workdays for the whole year, said: "There is hope again!" He increased his annual workdays to 185.
    From then on, the members' enthusiasm for production increased again. The men accumulated fertilizer, prepared the land, and prepared to expand the cotton fields, while the women happily went to the fields to pick late cotton in the snow.
    From this, the cadres here have come to a beneficial experience: the economic life of farmers should be less interfered with and more led.

### 少干涉，多领导

    少干涉，多领导
    本报记者　吕建中
    由于农业生产的发展和粮食、油料、棉花统购政策的实行，农民手里的钱比以往任何时候都多了。应当怎样引导农民给手里的钱找到正当的出路？应当怎样帮助农民正确地安排生产和生活？这确实是今天农村工作干部所遇到的一个新问题。
    有些干部对农民手里的钱很不放心，看到农民在生活方面花一些钱，就轻率地扣上“浪费”的帽子，于是对农民生活过多干涉的现象就发生了。有的干部像管家婆似地检查农民到集上买回了什么东西；农民买一件绒衣，买一包点心走亲戚，他也要责问一番。有的地区在粮食仓库门前摆着供销、信用、储蓄、归还贷款、订立合同等五张办公桌，卖粮的农民刚跨出仓库的门坎，就被一片喊声所包围：“喂，把钱存到银行吧，别拿回去浪费了！”“来来来，快交股金”……惹得农民说这是“五堂会审”。有的农业生产合作社硬是不肯把钱分给社员，有个社员因为姑娘出嫁，要求社长借支十五万元，社长说：“新式结婚，别浪费钱，先社后己嘛！”只批准借给两万元，气得这个社员钱也不要了，也不下地生产了。
    当然，今天的农村里确实有些人把集中出售农产品后收入的大量现金，用去大吃大喝，做投机生意，放高利贷。这当然是不对的。应当教育他们不要这样做。有些同志怕农民把钱浪费了，想法子使农民把钱用到农业增产和帮助国家建设上去，这种用意也是好的。可是，为什么往往得到相反的结果呢？这主要是因为他们不懂得农民的心思，对农民的经济生活不是积极地领导，而是生硬地干涉。这里举一个实际例子。
    河南安阳县产棉区西柏涧村一九五四年的棉花丰收了，全村十个农业生产合作社的社员都喜气洋溢地盼望着分红，好安排自己的生活。可是干部们怕分了红被社员浪费掉了，便兴了一个令：老社员一律不分红，合作社把钱统一存到银行里去；新社员卖了棉花马上把款向社里投资。社员们的兴头一下被打掉了，纷纷说：“这还劳动个啥，自己的钱自己做不得主！”“辛辛苦苦劳动一年，不叫钱在自己手里放一放！”于是没人积肥了，妇女也不下地摘棉花了。新社员看到老社员用一万元也得伸着手去央求社长，自己手里的钱越发不往社里投资了。干部本来是怕社员浪费，而有些社员们却更浪费得厉害了。有的社员明明手里有钱，也没多大花消，现在却硬找个花钱的因由，三番五次追着干部借钱。还有几十户社员去买棺材板，买砖打坟墓。到镇上下小馆的越来越多了。社里订生产计划，实行包耕包产，要社员自报劳动日，谁也不肯多报。牛吉福全年只报七十个劳动日，他说：“这就够我吃的了，劳动的再多，钱也到不了我手！”不仅如此，有些社员和社外群众甚至对社会主义前途也发生怀疑了，他们说：“现在就‘卡’的这么紧，到了社会主义社会，自己就更作不得主了。”
    西柏涧村的干部感到这样不行，便开会检查缺点，把该分的钱都分给了社员。和这同时，又加强了对社员的思想教育，用具体事实说明国家的利益、合作社的利益和社员的个人利益是一致的；说明要办好合作社必须靠大家，说明去年由于社里多投了资，棉花就丰收了；说明大家的钱来的不容易，应该厉行节约，花的得当；同时也说明合作社增加了生产，社员的生活也应当适当改善。干部还告诉社员：供销社已经办来了年货，大家都去买点东西过个好春节。
    这一来，社员的心放平了，局势转好了。实际上，社员们本心里那舍得把钱胡乱花了呢？他们把自己劳动所得的钱拿到手里，就会想到：“这一年的力总算没白出，这钱可不是容易来的呀，不能胡花了。”这样，许多人想来想去，觉得还是存在社里好。那些成天吵着要钱的社员现在反而不要了。社员牛吉贵钱也不支了，坟也不打了，父子俩商量起今年报多少劳动日。乡长路德胜所领导的第七社，新老社员共分红四千三百五十万元，结果社员们只留下八百多万元做日常和春节的费用，其余仍存到社里了。全村十个合作社的社员存到银行和投入合作社共有七亿元，占分红的百分之八十以上。
    接着，社里又发动社员订生产计划，实行包耕包产。社员自报劳动日非常踊跃。那个原来全年只报七十个劳动日的牛吉福说：“这还有奔头！”他把全年的劳动日提高到一百八十五个。
    从此，社员们的生产劲头又大了，男的积肥，整地，准备扩大棉田，妇女们也嘻嘻哈哈地踏着白雪下地摘晚棉花去了。
    由此，这里的干部得出了一条有益的经验：对农民的经济生活应该是少干涉，多领导。
