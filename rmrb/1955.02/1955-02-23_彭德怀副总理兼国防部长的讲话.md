Comrade Ambassador, Comrade Soldiers and Non-Commissioned Officers, Comrade Officers and Generals:

Today, we are here to celebrate the glorious 37th Anniversary of the Founding of the Soviet Army. On behalf of the Government of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people, and Chairman Mao Zedong, I extend warm congratulations to the heroic Soviet Army, and express my heartfelt gratitude and regards to all the officers and men of the Soviet Army stationed at the Lushunkou Naval Base.

Since its birth, the Soviet Army has regarded safeguarding the security of the motherland and maintaining world peace as its sacred mission. Over the past thirty-seven years, whether in the war to repel imperialist armed intervention, in the Great Patriotic War, or in the war to defeat Japanese imperialism, the Soviet Army has established outstanding achievements in fulfilling this sacred mission. In the years since the victory of the anti-fascist war, the Soviet Army has steadfastly implemented the peace policy of the Soviet state. Now, the Soviet Army is the world's foremost army, well-equipped and with a high degree of combat capability. The strength and invincibility of the Soviet Army lies not only in its possession of completely modern weapons and military equipment, but, more importantly, in the guidance of Marxist-Leninist military science, and in the lofty ideals and great patriotism and internationalism of each of its officers and soldiers. The facts of the past thirty-seven years have proven that the Soviet Army is well-deservedly the strong pillar of world peace and international security, and the great defender of human progress and world civilization.

Five years ago, the United States conspired to conclude a unilateral peace treaty with Japan in order to revive Japanese militarism and instigate Japanese militarist elements to carry out aggression again. Therefore, at that time, China and the Soviet Union decided to jointly defend the Lushunkou Naval Base. This was absolutely necessary. In September 1951, the United States openly signed a unilateral peace treaty with Japan that excluded China and the Soviet Union, and at the same time signed the so-called US-Japan Security Treaty and the US-Japan Administrative Agreement with Japan. This placed Japan under long-term military occupation by the United States and attempted to make Japan an accomplice in US aggression in Asia. In fact, the United States was using Japan as a base to carry out its war of aggression against Korea. Therefore, in September 1952, China and the Soviet Union agreed to extend the period of joint use of the Lushunkou Naval Base. Subsequently, thanks to the efforts of China, the Soviet Union, and other peace-loving countries, the wars in Korea and Indochina ended in 1953 and 1954 respectively, and the international tension eased to a certain extent. At the same time, the Japanese people's struggle for national independence, democracy, and peace also reached a new high tide. On the other hand, with the help of the Soviet Union, China has greatly strengthened its national defense, and the friendly and cooperative relations between China and the Soviet Union have become more consolidated. All this prompted China and the Soviet Union to agree in October 1954 that the Soviet Army would withdraw from the Lushunkou Naval Base before May 31, 1955. While making this decision, the governments of China and the Soviet Union also issued a joint declaration on relations with Japan, expressing their willingness to take steps to normalize their relations with Japan, and expressing their full support for Japan's efforts in this regard.

Does the decision of the Chinese and Soviet governments regarding the withdrawal of the Soviet Army from the jointly used Lushunkou Naval Base mean that we have relaxed our vigilance against the possibility of the US aggressive bloc using Japanese militarism to carry out aggression? Absolutely not. We have not underestimated in the slightest the possibility of Japan being used to carry out aggressive plans that are both contrary to the interests of the Japanese people and contrary to maintaining peace in the Far East. However, the recent development of the political situation in Japan has made us even more convinced that the Japanese people will find sufficient strength within themselves to embark on the path of shaking off dependence on foreign countries and revitalizing their own motherland, and embark on the path of establishing normal relations and carrying out extensive economic cooperation and cultural ties with other countries, especially with their neighbors.

Does the decision of the Chinese and Soviet governments regarding the withdrawal of the Soviet Army from the jointly used Lushunkou Naval Base mean showing weakness to the aggressors? Absolutely not. On the contrary, this decision shows that the strength and unity of our two countries have been unprecedentedly strengthened. If anyone dares to launch a war of aggression, our two countries will support each other at any time. We warn the US aggressive bloc not to miscalculate, otherwise the most tragic and most shameful end will be waiting for it!

In fact, the US aggressive bloc often regards the efforts made by China and the Soviet Union to strive for peace as a sign of weakness. It is actively rearming West Germany, reviving Japanese militarism, and organizing aggressive blocs and establishing military bases all over the world to threaten and encircle the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democratic countries. It even openly clamors for launching an atomic war. After occupying China's Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, the United States has recently deployed troops in the Taiwan Strait in an attempt to use war threats and war provocations to force the Chinese people to tolerate US aggression and abandon the just struggle to liberate their own territory of Taiwan. The United States seems to really think that threats and blackmail can scare us.

However, the US aggressive bloc has miscalculated. The people and armies of China and the Soviet Union are not without experience in opposing aggression. Any threat and blackmail has not been able to scare us in the past, and will never be able to scare us in the future. Our two peoples have always been able to defend themselves and give a devastating counterattack to those who infringe upon their freedom and independence. This will continue to be the case in the future. Chairman Mao Zedong is right in saying: "We can all see that, under the great cooperation of our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, all imperialist plans for aggression cannot but be shattered. They must be completely shattered. As long as imperialism launches a war of aggression, we and the people of the world will certainly eliminate them from the earth!"

Comrades, during your stationing at the Lushunkou Naval Base, you have well fulfilled the tasks entrusted to you by the Soviet government and the Soviet people, and have fully carried forward the glorious traditions of the great Soviet Army. The Chinese people will always remember you. As you are about to leave our country, please allow me to pay tribute to you, and through you, to the entire Soviet Army.

The Soviet Army was, is, and will always be an example for the Chinese People's Liberation Army to learn from. In order to build itself into a regularized and modernized revolutionary army, the Chinese People's Liberation Army must continuously and diligently learn from the advanced Soviet military science and the experience of the Soviet Army in building its army. The armies of China and the Soviet Union have the same lofty ideals and goals of struggle, and have unbreakable unity and friendship. For the sake of world peace and human progress, the armies of China and the Soviet Union will always advance shoulder to shoulder.

Long live the heroic Soviet Army!
Long live the unity

### 彭德怀副总理兼国防部长的讲话

    彭德怀副总理兼国防部长的讲话大使同志、战士和士官同志们、军官和将军同志们：
    今天我们在这里庆祝苏联建军三十七周年的光荣节日，我谨代表中华人民共和国政府、中国人民和毛泽东主席，向英雄的苏联军队表示热烈的祝贺，并向驻在旅顺口海军根据地的苏军全体将士表示衷心的感谢和慰问。
    苏联军队从诞生的第一天起，就以保卫祖国安全和维护世界和平作为自己的神圣使命。三十七年来，不论是在打退帝国主义武装干涉的战争中，或者是在伟大的卫国战争中，或者是在战胜日本帝国主义的战争中，苏联军队在执行这一神圣使命方面，都建立了卓越的功勋。在反法西斯战争胜利以后的年代里，苏联军队坚定地执行着苏维埃国家的和平政策。现在，苏联军队已经是世界上头等的、装备优良的、具有高度作战能力的军队。苏联军队的强大和不可战胜，不仅在于它拥有完全现代化的武器和军事装备，而且，更重要地，还在于它有马克思列宁主义的军事科学的指导，它的每一个官兵都具有崇高的理想和伟大的爱国主义、国际主义精神。三十七年来的事实证明，苏联军队当之无愧地是世界和平和国际安全的坚强支柱，是人类进步和世界文明的伟大保卫者。
    五年前，美国阴谋缔结片面的对日和约，以便于复活日本军国主义并策动日本军国主义分子重新进行侵略。因此，当时中苏两国决定共同防守旅顺口海军根据地。这是完全必要的。一九五一年九月美国公然签订了排斥中国和苏联的片面对日和约，同时又同日本签订了所谓美日安全条约和美日行政协定。这就把日本置于美国的长期军事占领之下，并且企图使日本成为美国侵略亚洲的帮手。事实上，美国正是以日本为基地进行侵略朝鲜的战争的。因此，中苏两国在一九五二年九月同意延长共同使用旅顺口海军根据地的期限。其后，由于中苏两国和其他爱好和平国家的努力，朝鲜和印度支那的战争在一九五三年和一九五四年先后停止了，国际紧张局势因而有了一定程度的和缓。日本人民争取祖国独立、民主、和平的斗争，也同时有了新的高涨。另一方面，中国在苏联的帮助下，大大地加强了自己的国防力量，中苏两国的友好合作关系也更加巩固。这一切就促使中苏两国在一九五四年十月议定苏联军队在一九五五年五月三十一日前撤出旅顺口海军根据地。中苏两国政府在作出这个决定的同时，还发表了关于对日本关系的联合宣言，表示愿意采取步骤使它们同日本的关系正常化，并且表示将完全支持日本在这方面所作的努力。
    中苏两国政府关于苏联军队从共同使用的旅顺口海军根据地撤出的决定是不是意味着我们对于美国侵略集团利用日本军国主义进行侵略的可能性已经放松了警惕呢？绝对不是的。我们丝毫没有低估日本被利用来执行既与日本人民利益相违背、也与维护远东和平相违背的侵略计划的可能性。但是，日本最近的政局的发展使我们更加相信，日本人民会从自己身上找到足够的力量，踏上摆脱依附外国的地位和复兴自己祖国的道路，踏上同其他国家首先是同自己的邻国建立正常关系并进行广泛的经济合作和文化联系的道路。
    中苏两国政府关于苏联军队从共同使用的旅顺口海军根据地撤出的决定是不是意味着向侵略者示弱呢？绝对不是的。恰恰相反，这个决定说明我们两国的力量和团结已经空前加强。如果任何人敢于发动侵略战争，我们两国随时都会互相支援的。我们警告美国侵略集团，不要打错了算盘，否则等待着它的只能是最悲惨的最可耻的下场！
    事实上，美国侵略集团的确常常把中苏两国为争取和平而作的努力，看成是软弱的表现。它积极重新武装西德，复活日本军国主义，并且在世界各地组织侵略集团和建立军事基地，来威胁和包围苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家。它甚至公开叫嚣要发动原子战争。在侵占了中国的台湾和澎湖列岛以后，美国最近更陈兵台湾海峡，企图以战争威胁和战争挑衅来迫使中国人民容忍美国的侵略，放弃解放自己领土台湾的正义斗争。美国似乎当真认为，用威胁和讹诈就可以把我们吓倒。
    但是，美国侵略集团是失算了。中苏两国人民和他们的军队，对于反对侵略，并不是没有经验的。任何威胁和讹诈，过去没有能够、今后也永远不能够吓倒我们。我们两国人民从来就能够保卫自己并且给侵犯他们自由和独立的人以毁灭性的反击。今后还会是这样。毛泽东主席说得对：“我们大家可以看到，在我们中苏两国的伟大合作下，一切帝国主义的侵略计划，没有不能被粉碎的。它们一定要被彻底粉碎。只要帝国主义发动侵略战争，我们和全世界人民就一定要将它们从地球上消灭干净！”
    同志们，你们在驻守旅顺口海军根据地的期间，很好地完成了苏联政府和苏联人民交付给你们的任务，充分地发扬了伟大苏联军队的光荣传统。中国人民将永远怀念着你们。在你们将要离开我国的时候，请允许我向你们，并通过你们，向全体苏联军队致敬。
    苏联军队过去是，现在是，将来也还是中国人民解放军学习的榜样。为了把自己建设成为一支正规化和现代化的革命军队，中国人民解放军要不断努力地学习苏联的先进军事科学和苏军的建军经验。中苏两国的军队有一致的崇高理想和斗争目标，有牢不可破的团结和友谊。为了世界和平和人类进步，中苏两国的军队将永远并肩前进。
    英雄的苏联军队万岁！
    中苏两国军队的团结和合作万岁！
    中苏两国牢不可破的伟大友谊万岁！
