    A Major Reform of China's Military System

    The Fifth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress discussed and revised the "Draft Law of the People's Republic of China on Military Service" and resolved to have the State Council distribute this draft to people's committees at all levels for discussion and to solicit the opinions of the people, so that it can be further revised and submitted to the next meeting of the National People's Congress for discussion and adoption. Article 103 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates: "It's the sacred duty of every citizen of the People's Republic of China to defend the motherland. It is an honorable obligation of citizens of the People's Republic of China to perform military service in accordance with the law." The current draft military service law is based on the spirit of this article of the Constitution and fully conforms to the interests of our people and the needs of national defense.

    China's compulsory military service system is gradually being established based on China's specific conditions and actual needs, and drawing on the advanced experience of Soviet military construction. It is a major reform of China's military system. The conditions for gradually implementing compulsory military service in China are now fully mature. After overthrowing the long-term exploitation and enslavement of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and achieving the great victory of the people's revolution, our people have now entered a great period of socialist construction after five years of economic recovery and the completion of various social reforms. In order to protect the achievements of the Chinese people's revolution and socialist construction from being undermined, after the Government Administration Council issued an order in September 1954 to recruit additional soldiers, thousands of eligible young people across the country signed up to respond to the call. Especially after the promulgation of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, a large number of people continuously wrote letters to state organs, warmly requesting the opportunity to perform military service and fulfill their civic obligations. This shows that the implementation of compulsory military service is not only a system stipulated by the Constitution, but has also become a common patriotic requirement of the broad masses of people, especially the young people.

    For the long-term interests of our people, we should replace the voluntary military service system with the compulsory military service system. In the past, the voluntary military service system involved a portion of the population serving as soldiers for a long time to fight for the liberation of the people and defend the interests of the people. This was necessary and correct during the past revolutionary war period. However, the situation today has fundamentally changed, and it would be unreasonable for us to continue to adopt the voluntary military service system. Today, we have no reason to allow a portion of the population to serve as soldiers for the country and the people for a long time, without allowing the majority to perform military service. This not only fails to meet the demands of the broad masses of people, but also hinders the construction of a modern national defense. Only by implementing compulsory military service can our country have the necessary standing army and a strong trained reserve force to prepare to repel invaders who dare to invade our country at any time, protect socialist construction and the security of the motherland, and guarantee peace in Asia and the world. This is where the fundamental interests of the Chinese people lie. We cannot imagine carrying out socialist construction or creating a happy life without the security of the motherland and without peace in Asia and the world.

    Now, the draft military service law stipulates that all citizens of the People's Republic of China, regardless of nationality, race, occupation, social origin, religious belief, or education level, must perform military service in accordance with the law. Military service is divided into active service and reserve service. The age for military service is stipulated as eighteen to forty years old. The term of active service varies depending on the military branch, and is divided into three, four, and five years. The draft military service law also stipulates that officers take military work as a long-term or even lifelong career, and that sergeants and soldiers who have completed their active service are incorporated into the first category of reserve service to continue serving in the military. Conscripts who have not been conscripted for active service and conscripts who are usually exempt from active service are incorporated into the second category of reserve service and must receive a certain period of military training according to the needs of the state. This gives every eligible citizen of our country the glorious opportunity to participate in defending the motherland and protecting the interests of the people.

    According to the needs of modern national defense construction, military cadres must become professional officers. Because their responsibilities are greater and their expertise is deeper, they must make the work of defending the motherland and modernizing national defense a long-term or even lifelong career. At the same time, because modern military equipment and technology are more complex, it is necessary to have a considerable level of political awareness and cultural and scientific knowledge to master them. Therefore, soldiers in active service must undergo a considerable period of study and training. The draft military service law stipulates a term of active service of three years for the army, four years for the air force, and five years for the navy. This is based on the time required to master this military equipment and learn modern combat methods. The draft military service law also stipulates that trained sergeants and soldiers can be legally transferred to the reserve service after completing their active service, while new conscripts can legally enlist and receive military training. In this way, every year a large number of trained people are legally transferred to the reserve service, while a large number of new eligible citizens enlist and receive training. After a certain period of time, our country will not only have a sufficient standing army, but also have an extremely strong trained reserve force. When the country is invaded, it will be able to quickly organize a large number of combat troops to resist the invaders.

    The implementation of compulsory military service can also enable the Chinese army and the broader masses of the people to establish a closer, flesh-and-blood relationship. This is because the vast majority of the people have children or relatives serving in the active army, or in the reserve, so they will inevitably be more concerned about the army, cherish the army, and be able to more actively support the army. At the same time, because the broad masses of the people have the obligation to perform military service, their defense of the motherland can be more closely and extensively linked to the defense of the achievements of the people's revolution and construction. Therefore, when the country is invaded, they will inevitably be able to fight the enemy with incomparable courage and wisdom. This makes all the armies and all the people of our country more closely united into a national defense force that is strong enough to defeat any powerful enemy.

    Our socialist construction cause requires a large amount of funds and talent. These funds and talents cannot be obtained by relying on any external force, but must rely on our own accumulation and cultivation. After the implementation of compulsory military service, because the country has a strong reserve force, it can quickly mobilize them to resist the enemy when the enemy invades. Therefore, in peacetime, it is not necessary to retain a large standing army, but it can be gradually reduced to the necessary number, so as to save a large amount of material resources and manpower for socialist peaceful construction. At the same time, because the Chinese People's Liberation Army educates the troops with the spirit of patriotism and socialist ideology, and the army lives a collective life, which is conducive to education, according to the provisions of the draft military service law, our country will have a considerable number of young people enter the People's Liberation Army every year to receive socialist collective education, and a considerable number of soldiers who have completed their service will be discharged and return to participate in peaceful construction. All the soldiers who have returned from discharge have received three to five years of intensive training. On the one hand, they have improved their political awareness and patriotic enthusiasm in the army, and have been trained in organization and discipline. On the other hand, they have also learned a lot of scientific knowledge and technology, which enables our country to continuously obtain a large number of construction talents who have received socialist education and have certain skills in a concentrated manner, which will powerfully promote our country's socialist cause.

    The draft military service law also takes into account China's social customs and the lives of the people. Only children and the sole laborers who maintain the family's livelihood are usually exempt from active service, in order to avoid affecting the production and life of the people due to active service. These provisions can not only greatly reduce the people's burden of preferential treatment such as farming on behalf of the family, reduce government relief expenses, but also benefit production.

    It can be seen that the various provisions of the draft military service law fully embody the complete consistency between the interests of our country and all the people.

    In order to gradually implement compulsory military service, we must widely and deeply carry out the publicity of the draft military service law and solicit the people's opinions on the military service law. The experience of various places has proved that as long as the various specific provisions and significance of the compulsory military service system are explained to the people in detail and correctly, the people will show more enthusiastic support for this system, believing that it is a good system that can both enhance national defense strength and enhance construction strength, and the work of recruiting additional soldiers can also be completed smoothly, and even greatly exceed the original plan. However, we should also see that the implementation of this system is still the first time in our country, and it is related to the lives of every person and every family, and it is a major event in the political life of our people. Some people among the masses have some doubts and concerns because they are unfamiliar with this system. In order to smoothly implement this system, party and government leading organs in various places should organize the broad masses of staff to carefully study and discuss this draft military service law, understand its spirit and various specific provisions, and put forward their own opinions. Our compulsory military service system is based on the conscious basis of the people, so we must carry out universal publicity to the people. Although there have been instances of rumors and sabotage by counter-revolutionary elements in some areas, after extensive and in-depth publicity and careful explanation, the people's doubts have naturally been dispelled, and the counter-revolutionary elements and saboteurs have been exposed and isolated. Facts show that the compulsory military service system is fully in line with the requirements and wishes of the Chinese people. Although some difficulties may be encountered at the beginning of implementation, these difficulties can be overcome. As long as we actively publicize this system, so that it is known to every household and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, it will become a patriotic and active action of the people.

    At the same time, in-depth education is also needed in the People's Liberation Army, so that everyone can understand the benefits of the compulsory military service system, and on the other hand, understand that the change from the voluntary military service system to the compulsory military service system can only be gradually implemented due to various limitations. Therefore, some comrades, although they have served in the army for a long time, still cannot be demobilized immediately, otherwise it will affect national security and construction. They should still step up their study of modern military knowledge and technology, master modern equipment, and vigilantly defend the motherland.

    China's 600 million people are building their socialist new life with unprecedented unity and confidence. Therefore, there is an urgent need to strengthen national defense, defend their victorious achievements and the bright and happy socialist future. The implementation of compulsory military service will organize the people's demand and strong will to defend the motherland into a powerful material force, enabling us to defeat any enemy's provocation and aggression.

### 我国军事制度的一项重大改革

    我国军事制度的一项重大改革
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会第五次会议讨论并修正了“中华人民共和国兵役法草案”，并决议将这一草案，交由国务院发给各级人民委员会讨论和征求人民意见，以便再加修正，提请全国人民代表大会下一次会议讨论通过。中华人民共和国宪法第一百零三条规定：“保卫祖国是中华人民共和国每一个公民的神圣职责。依照法律服兵役是中华人民共和国公民的光荣义务。”现在这个兵役法草案就是根据这一条宪法的精神的，是完全符合于我国人民的利益和国防的需要的。
    我国的义务兵役制是根据我国的具体条件和实际需要并且吸取了苏联先进的军事建设经验，逐步建立的，是我国军事制度上的一项重大改革。现时在我国逐步推行义务兵役制的条件是完全成熟了的。我国人民在推翻了帝国主义，封建主义和官僚资本主义长期的剥削和奴役，取得了人民革命的伟大胜利以后，经过五年来的经济恢复和各种社会改革的完成，现在已经进入了伟大的社会主义建设时期。为了保卫我国人民革命成果和社会主义建设不受破坏，政务院在一九五四年九月发布征集补充兵员的命令以后，全国各地都有成千上万的适龄青年报名，响应征召。特别在中华人民共和国宪法颁布后，不断地有大量群众写信给国家机关，热烈请求给以服兵役履行公民义务的机会。这就说明实行义务兵役制，不但是宪法所规定的制度，并且已经成了广大群众特别是青年群众的爱国主义的共同要求了。
    为了我国人民自身的长远的利益，我们应该用义务兵役制代替志愿兵制。因为过去的志愿兵制，是由一部分人长期当兵去争取人民的解放，捍卫人民的利益，这在过去国内革命战争时期是必要的正确的。但是今天的情况就根本改变了，如果我们继续采用志愿兵制就将是不合理的了。今天我们没有理由让一部分人长期为国家为人民而当兵，却不使大多数人来服兵役。这样不但不能满足广大人民的要求，而且是会妨碍现代化的国防建设的。只有实行义务兵役制，才能使我们的国家有必要的常备兵力和雄厚的经过训练的后备兵员，以准备随时反击敢于进犯我国的侵略者，保卫社会主义建设和祖国的安全，保障亚洲和世界的和平。这是我国人民的根本利益之所在。我们不能想像没有祖国的安全、没有亚洲和世界的和平，而能够进行社会主义的建设，能够创造幸福的生活的。
    现在，兵役法草案规定，凡是中华人民共和国公民，不分民族、种族、职业、社会出身、宗教信仰和教育程度，都必须依法服兵役。兵役分为现役和预备役两种。服役年龄规定为年满十八岁到四十岁。服现役的期限，依据军种的不同，分为三年、四年和五年。兵役法草案并规定军官以军队工作为长期的甚至是终身的职业，军士和兵服现役期满后编入第一类预备役续服兵役。未被征集服现役的应征公民和平时免服现役的应征公民编入第二类预备役，并必须按照国家的需要接受一定时期的军事训练。这就使得我国每一个适龄公民都有参加保卫祖国、保卫人民利益的光荣机会。
    按照现代化国防建设的需要，军队干部必须成为职业军官。由于他们的责任更重大、业务更深邃，所以必须以保卫祖国和现代化国防建设工作成为长期的甚至是终身的职业。但在同时，由于现代化军事装备和技术较为复杂，必须有相当的政治觉悟和文化科学水平才能掌握，所以服现役的士兵又必须经过相当时间的学习和训练。兵役法草案所规定的陆军三年、空军四年和海军五年的现役期限，就是根据掌握这些军事装备和学习现代化作战方法所需要的时间而拟定的。兵役法草案又规定了经过训练的军士和兵，服现役期满后就可以依法转入预备役，而新的应征公民，依法入伍接受军事训练。这样，每年有大批经过训练的人依法转入预备役，同时也有大批新的适龄公民入伍受训。经过一定的时间以后，我们的国家不仅将拥有足够的常备兵力，并且可以拥有极其雄厚的经过训练的后备兵员。在国家遭受侵略的时候，就能够迅速地组织起大量的作战部队去反抗侵略者。
    实行义务兵役制，还可以使我国军队和更广大的人民群众建立更密切的血肉相连的关系。这是因为绝大部分人民群众都有子弟或亲人在军队中服现役，或者服预备役，因此他们就必然更加关心军队，爱护军队，能够更积极地支援军队。同时，也由于广大群众都有服兵役的义务，他们保卫祖国是可以和保卫人民革命成果和建设成果发生更为密切更为广泛的联系，因此在国家遭受侵略时，必然能够以无比的勇敢和智慧同敌人作战。这就使我国所有的军队和全体人民更加紧密地结合成为足以战胜任何强大敌人的国防力量。
    我们的社会主义建设事业需要大量的资金和人才。这些资金和人才不可能依靠任何外力来取得，而要依靠我们自己的积累和培养。实行义务兵役制以后，因为国家拥有了雄厚的后备兵力，在敌人侵犯时就可以迅速征集他们去反抗敌人，所以在平时，就不必要保留大量的常备兵，而可以逐步缩减到必要数量，以节省出大量的物力财力和人力，来用于社会主义的和平建设事业。同时，因为我国人民解放军是以爱国主义精神和社会主义思想教育部队的，而军队又是过着集体生活，便于进行教育的，所以根据兵役法草案的规定，我们国家每年都要有相当数量的青年，进入人民解放军受到社会主义的集体教育，每年也要有相当数量服役期满的军人退伍回来参加和平建设。所有退伍回来的军人，都受过三年至五年集中训练。他们一方面在部队中提高了政治觉悟和爱国热情，并且得到了组织性和纪律性的锻炼。另一方面，他们也学会了许多科学知识和技术，这就使我们国家能够不断地获得大量的集中地受过社会主义教育和有一定技能的建设人才，就将有力地促进我国的社会主义事业。
    兵役法草案同时还照顾了我国的社会习惯和人民群众的生活。独子和维持家庭生活的唯一劳动力平时免服现役，就是为了不至因服现役而影响人民群众的生产和生活，这些规定不仅可以大大减轻人民群众的代耕等优待负担，减少政府的救济费用，并且有利于生产。
    由此可见，兵役法草案的各项规定，充分地体现了我们国家和全体人民的利益是完全一致的。
    为了逐步推行义务兵役制，我们必须广泛而深入地开展兵役法草案的宣传。并征求人民对兵役法的意见，各地的经验证明：只要详细和正确地给人民群众讲清了义务兵役制的各种具体规定和意义，人民群众就对这一制度表现出更加热烈的拥护，认为这是一种既能增强国防力量又能增强建设力量的好制度，征集补充兵员的工作也能顺利完成，甚至大大超过原定计划。但是，我们也应该看到，推行这一制度在我国还是首次，它关系着每一个人和每一个家庭的生活，是我国人民政治生活中的一件大事。人民群众中有一些人由于对这一制度生疏，因此还有或多或少的疑问和顾虑。为了顺利推行这一制度，各地党政领导机关就应该组织广大工作人员好好研究和讨论这个兵役法草案，了解它的精神实质和各种具体规定，并提出自己的意见。我们的义务兵役制是建立在人民群众自觉的基础上，因此，我们必须向人民群众进行普遍的宣传。有些地区虽然发生过反革命分子造谣破坏，但是经过广泛的深入宣传和细致的解释，群众的疑虑就自然消释，反革命分子和破坏分子就暴露出来，孤立起来了。事实说明，义务兵役制是完全合乎我国人民的要求和愿望的。虽然在开始推行的时候可能遇到一些困难，但这些困难都是可以克服的。只要积极宣传这一制度，达到家喻户晓，深入人心，它就会变成人民群众爱国的积极行动。
    同时，在人民解放军中也需要进行深入的教育，使大家一方面了解义务兵役制的好处，另一方面了解由志愿兵制改变为义务兵役制，由于各种条件的限制，只能逐步推行。因此，有些同志虽然在军队服务很久了，但是仍然不能马上复员，否则就将会影响国家安全和建设事业。他们仍然应该加紧学习现代化的军事知识与技术，掌握现代化的装备，警惕地保卫祖国。
    我国六万万人民正以空前的团结一致，满怀信心地建设着自己社会主义的新生活。因此也就迫切地需要加强国防，保卫自己的胜利成果和光明幸福的社会主义的前途。推行义务兵役制，将把人民群众这种保卫祖国的要求和坚强意志组织起来，成为强大的物质力量，使我们能够战胜任何敌人的挑衅和进犯。
