    中国文化周在赫尔辛基闭幕
    【新华社布拉格十八日电】赫尔辛基消息：芬中协会在赫尔辛基举行的中国文化周已在十三日闭幕。中国工艺品展览会的观众有三万三千多人。中国电影的观众有六千六百多人。
    从芬兰报纸的评论中可以看出，中国工艺品的展览获得了芬兰公众的高度评价。“农民报”说：中国工艺品展览把人们引入了“美丽而奇异的境界”。“芬兰社会民主党报”说：“中国的色彩是如此纯美，看了心灵都受感动。”“晚报”说：“展览会在各界人民中引起巨大兴趣。很多人询问能否在芬兰买到这些物品”。
    中国电影也同样引起了观众的广泛兴趣。“芬兰社会民主党报”说：“电影周将使芬兰观众对中国电影艺术获得连贯的了解，并且通过多样主题，表现出中华人民共和国的艺术和它的奋斗经过”。“劳动人民报”说：这些影片“有助于芬中人民之间关系的发展”。
    正如“劳动人民报”所说：中国文化周“获得了光辉的成就”。许多观众希望中国工艺品也能在芬兰其他城市展出。
