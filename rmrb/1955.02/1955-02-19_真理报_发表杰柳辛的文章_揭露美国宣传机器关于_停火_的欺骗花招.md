Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 18th: "Pravda" published an article by Zhelyukhin titled: "A Deceptive Trick of the American Propaganda Machine." The article stated: As public opinion everywhere is widely demanding that the United States stop its brutal interference in China's internal affairs and withdraw its armed forces from Taiwan and other Chinese territories, the American propaganda machine is making loud noises, hypocritically insisting that the United States and its allies advocate the immediate restoration of peace in that region of the world, and are seeking a "ceasefire." The New Zealand government, apparently acting on the orders of the United States, submitted its notorious "ceasefire" proposal to the Security Council.

The newspaper immediately publicized this matter and described this "ceasefire" proposal as "proof of the peace-loving nature" of the United States and its ally, New Zealand.

While praising New Zealand's proposal, the American propaganda machine is also trying to spread an atmosphere of suspicion regarding the Soviet Union's proposal to the Security Council to discuss the United States' act of aggression against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan and other island regions of China. The American propaganda machine is resorting to blatant fabrications of lies in an attempt to make it seem as if the purpose of the Soviet proposal is to oppose the cessation of hostilities. However, people only need to look at the text of these documents to realize the extent to which the American propaganda machine distorts the facts in a crude and shameless manner. New Zealand, at the behest of Washington, put forward a proposal for a "ceasefire" in the coastal island region of China, in order to achieve a conspiracy: to force the People's Republic of China to abandon its sovereignty over the Chinese territories of Taiwan and Penghu, and to perpetuate the situation of illegal American occupation of these islands forever.

The Soviet Union put forward a proposal to prevent any party from taking hostile actions in the Taiwan region, the purpose of which is not only to achieve a ceasefire, but also to eliminate the root cause of the deterioration of the situation in the Far East to a dangerous point, namely, to end the United States' interference in China's internal affairs.

The deceptive tricks of the American propaganda machine are supported by London.

While pretending to sympathize with the People's Republic of China, the British Foreign Office has decided to play another hypocritical farce, which is to promise to hand over China's own coastal islands of Dachen, Matsu, and Kinmen to China, and to demand that China abandon its rights to its Taiwan and Penghu in exchange.

Zhelyukhin finally said that the fact that British diplomats have put forward such a "suggestion" shows that they have lost all sense of reality.

It is inconceivable to truly resolve the Taiwan issue and ease international tensions in this region of the world without recognizing the national rights and interests of the People's Republic of China.

### “真理报”发表杰柳辛的文章  揭露美国宣传机器关于“停火”的欺骗花招

    “真理报”发表杰柳辛的文章
    揭露美国宣传机器关于“停火”的欺骗花招
    【新华社十八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：“真理报”刊载了杰柳辛写的一篇文章，题目是：“关于美国宣传机器的一个欺骗花招”。文章说：当各地公众普遍要求美国停止对中国内政的横暴的干涉并且把它的武装力量撤出台湾和中国其他领土的时候，美国宣传机器发出大声的叫嚷，假惺惺地硬说美国和它的盟国主张立即恢复世界那个地区的和平，而且是在谋求“停火”。新西兰政府显然是奉美国之命，向安全理事会提出了它的臭名远扬的“停火”建议。
    报纸立即就这一件事大肆宣传，并且把这个
  “停火”建议说成是美国和其盟国新西兰“爱好和平的证明”。
    美国宣传机器一方面赞扬新西兰的建议，另一方面又企图散布空气，使人怀疑苏联提出的要求安全理事会讨论美国在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为的建议。美国宣传机器不惜粗暴地捏造谎言，力图把问题说得好像苏联提案的目的是反对停止敌对行动似的。但是，人们只要看一下这些文件的正文，就可以认识到美国宣传机器歪曲事实到如何粗暴和无耻的程度。新西兰奉华盛顿之命提出一个主张在中国沿海岛屿地区“停火”的建议，是要实现这样一个阴谋：迫使中华人民共和国放弃它对中国的领土——台湾和澎湖的主权，并且使美国非法侵占这些岛屿的局面永远保持下去。
    苏联提出一个提案，要求防止任何一方在台湾地区采取敌对行动，其目的不仅是要达成停火，而且要消除远东局势恶化到危险地步的根源，即终止美国对中国内政的干涉。
    美国宣传机器的欺骗花招得到伦敦方面的支持。
    英国外交部一面佯装同情中华人民共和国，一面却决定扮演另一出伪善的滑稽剧，就是答应把中国自己的沿海岛屿大陈、马祖和金门交给中国，而以此为交换条件要求中国放弃它对它的台湾和澎湖的权利。
    杰柳辛最后说，英国外交官们竟提出这样的
  “建议”，这就表明，他们已丧失了一切的现实感。
    不承认中华人民共和国的国家权利和利益而想要真正解决台湾地区的问题和和缓世界这一地区的国际紧张局势，那是不可想像的。
