Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 30th, via TASS: The German News Agency reports that the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic has issued a statement regarding the decree issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on January 25th concerning the end of the state of war between the Soviet Union and Germany.

The statement said: The decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet is a new and irrefutable proof that Germany can obtain peace and a happy future as long as it is determined to tear up the Paris military agreements and establish a peaceful and democratic country. This order is a new and major step towards the peaceful reunification of Germany and the granting of full sovereignty to the entire German nation.

The statement denounced Adenauer's deception of the German people, Adenauer insisted that the Soviet Union's order had no significance for the development of Germany, because Western countries had issued similar statements as early as 1951. The statement said: Adenauer forgot to say that the purpose of the Western countries' declaration on ending the state of war in 1951 was only to prepare for another war and to build a European army aimed at the East. These conspiracies are being carried out today through the Paris Agreements; while the purpose of the Soviet Union's declaration on ending the state of war is not to establish unilateral military alliances, but to open a path for establishing friendly relations between all the German people and the Soviet Union immediately after the West German Federal Assembly vetoes the Paris Agreements. These statements by Western countries only deepened the division of Germany, stipulating the continued occupation of Germany under the Paris Agreements, thereby completely depriving West Germany of its sovereignty; while the Soviet decision will end everything related to the war with Hitler and give all the German people the possibility of building their future in peace and freedom.

The statement said: The Soviet order makes it possible for the Federal Republic to immediately establish—if it wishes to establish—normal relations with the Soviet Union, and, after rejecting the Paris Agreements, to immediately prepare for free all-German democratic elections together with the German Democratic Republic. Such elections can be held in 1955, thus making the peaceful restoration of German unity obviously closer. This peaceful restoration of unity will enable Germany to break away from aggressive military alliances and participate in an all-European security treaty, in order to make its contribution to maintaining peace in Germany and Europe. Free all-German elections will also create a basis for concluding a peace treaty with the whole of Germany, thereby creating the prerequisites for the early withdrawal of all occupying forces from Germany.

The statement said: This great historical possibility still exists for the German people. Those who are unwilling to understand this are committing a crime against the next generation of the German people. Therefore, the German Democratic Republic is doing its utmost to oppose the Paris Agreements; if the Paris Agreements are ratified, it will fulfill its responsibility as a defender of all-German peace with greater strength. As a bulwark of peace and the peaceful restoration of a unified Germany, it will use all its strength to ensure that this part of Germany is free from the enslavement of German militarism and imperialism. The German Democratic Republic will use all the strength it derives from its friendly relations with the Soviet Union and all other countries in the peace camp to block Adenauer's path to war.

### 德意志民主共和国部长会议发表声明  欢迎苏联结束苏德战争状态的决定

    德意志民主共和国部长会议发表声明
    欢迎苏联结束苏德战争状态的决定
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社柏林三十日讯：德意志通讯社消息：德意志民主共和国部长会议就苏联最高苏维埃主席团一月二十五日发布的关于结束苏联同德国之间的战争状态的命令发表了声明。
    声明说：苏联最高苏维埃主席团的命令是一个新的不可辩驳的证据，说明只要德国决心撕毁巴黎军事协定并且建立一个和平的和民主的国家，德国是能够得到和平和一个幸福的前途的。这个命令是走向和平地重新统一德国和给予整个德意志民族以完全的主权的一个新的重大步骤。
    声明斥责了阿登纳对德国人民的欺骗，阿登纳硬说苏联的这项命令对德国的发展没有任何重要意义，因为西方国家早在一九五一年就发表了类似的声明。声明说：阿登纳忘记了说，西方国家在一九五一年发表关于结束战争状态的声明的目的只是要准备另一次战争并建立一支矛头针对东方的欧洲军，这些阴谋今天正通过巴黎协定进行着；而苏联关于结束战争状态的声明的目的不是要建立片面的军事联盟，而是要开辟一条在西德联邦议院否决巴黎协定以后立即建立全体德国人民和苏联之间的友好关系的道路。西方国家的这些声明只是加深德国的分裂，规定在巴黎协定下继续占领德国，从而使西德完全丧失主权；而苏联的决定将结束同希特勒战争有关的一切事情，并且给全体德国人民以在和平和自由的情况下建设他们的未来的可能性。
    声明说：苏联的命令使联邦共和国可以立即建立——如果它希望建立的话——同苏联之间的正常关系，并且在拒绝巴黎协定以后立即同德意志民主共和国一起准备举行自由的全德民主选举。这种选举可以在一九五五年举行，从而使和平恢复德国的统一显然接近。这种和平恢复统一将使德国可以摆脱侵略性的军事联盟和参加一个全欧安全条约，以便为保持德国和欧洲的和平作出它的贡献。自由的全德选举还将为同整个德国缔结和约创造基础，从而也就创造了一切占领军早日撤出德国的先决条件。
    声明说：对德国人民来说，仍然是存在着这种巨大的历史可能性的。那些不愿意了解这一点的人们就是对德国人民的下一代犯罪。因此，德意志民主共和国正在竭尽全力反对巴黎协定；如果巴黎协定被批准的话，它将以更大的力量来履行它作为全德和平的保卫者所负的责任。作为和平以及和平恢复统一德国的堡垒，它将用一切力量来保障德国的这一部分，使它不受德国军国主义和帝国主义的奴役。德意志民主共和国将使用从它同苏联及和平阵营中的一切其他国家间的友好关系中得到的一切力量来堵塞阿登纳的战争道路。
