The International Obligations of the Geneva Accords Must Not Be Betrayed
    According to Agence France-Presse, Laos will send an observer to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization meeting to be held in Bangkok on February 23.
    The so-called "Southeast Asia Treaty" is the treaty under which the colonial countries in Asia established a military bloc in Asia at the Manila Conference in September 1954 under the instigation of the United States. This treaty openly interferes in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries, creates division and tension in Asia, and threatens peace in Asia. This treaty and its protocol have designated Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam as territories to which the treaty applies, arbitrarily dividing them into the "protected" area of ​​the signatory countries; this has already violated the Geneva Conference agreement that the three Indochinese countries shall not participate in military alliances.
    The final declaration of the Geneva Conference clearly stipulates that each participating country of the Geneva Conference, in its relations with Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam, guarantees to respect the sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity of the above-mentioned countries, and shall not interfere in their internal affairs in any way. China abides by this promise, and China also closely observes whether other countries also abide by this promise. The United States, Britain, and France are all participating countries in the Geneva Conference and should bear common obligations. Laos is a country that should be jointly guaranteed by the participating countries of the Geneva Conference. The Geneva Conference agreement clearly stipulates that it shall not participate in military alliances and shall not serve aggressive policies. But now there are reports that Laos will send observers to the Bangkok meeting, which is a further violation of the Geneva Conference agreement. This behavior will obviously be a dangerous step and should arouse the close attention of the whole world.

### 日内瓦协议的国际义务不容背弃

    日内瓦协议的国际义务不容背弃
    据法新社报道，老挝将派遣一名观察员出席二月二十三日在曼谷举行的东南亚条约组织会议。
    所谓“东南亚条约”就是美国策划下在一九五四年九月马尼拉会议上建立殖民国家在亚洲的军事集团的条约。这一条约公然干涉东南亚国家的内政，在亚洲制造分裂和紧张局势，威胁亚洲的和平。这一条约以及它的议定书把柬埔寨、老挝和越南南部划为条约所适用的领土，把它们任意地划入签字国家的“保护”区域；这就已经违反了日内瓦会议关于印度支那三国不得参加军事同盟的协议。
    日内瓦会议的最后宣言中明确规定：日内瓦会议的每个与会国家在对柬埔寨、老挝和越南三国的关系上，保证尊重上述各国的主权、独立、统一和领土完整，并对其内政不予任何干涉。中国是遵守这一诺言的，中国也密切注意其他国家是否同样遵守这一诺言。美国、英国、法国都是日内瓦会议的与会国家，都应该承担共同的义务。老挝是日内瓦会议与会各国所应该共同保证的国家，日内瓦会议的协议中明确规定不得参加军事同盟，不得服务于侵略政策。但是现在却有报道说老挝将派遣观察员出席曼谷会议，这就是进一步地违反日内瓦会议的协议。这种行为显然将会是一个危险的步骤，应该引起全世界的密切注意。
