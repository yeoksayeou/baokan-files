Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 16th (TASS dispatch)

The Security Council has now heard the statements of representatives of several countries. They have all expressed dissatisfaction, or even "disappointment," in one way or another with the reply of the Government of the People's Republic of China to the Security Council's invitation to participate in the discussion of the agenda item proposed by the New Zealand delegation.

However, it is difficult to take such expressions of dissatisfaction, or even "disappointment," seriously, because in fact almost none of the representatives who spoke expected the Government of the People's Republic of China to give an affirmative reply to the invitation presented to it, nor could such a reply be expected. This is evident, for example, from a message from the Associated Press. A message from this news agency on February 3 stated that the reply of the People's Republic of China was disappointing, but not entirely unexpected.

Indeed, under what circumstances did the Security Council make the decision to invite? What was the purpose of inviting a representative of the People's Republic of China?

As everyone knows, the agenda of the Security Council's last meeting included two items: the first item was the New Zealand proposal on the issue of "hostile actions in certain island areas along the coast of mainland China," and the second item was the Soviet proposal on "US aggression against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan and other island areas of China." The majority decision in the Security Council was to first discuss the New Zealand proposal, although this decision clearly did not take into account the full complexity of the situation in the Far East.

The Soviet delegation has pointed out that the New Zealand proposal to consider the issue of hostile actions in certain island areas along the coast of China deliberately fails to mention the root causes of the tensions that have developed in the Far East. It is noteworthy that the representatives who spoke today all acknowledged the existence of a threat to peace in the Far East. But none of the representatives mentioned the source of this threat. Speaking of the root of the Far East tensions, that lies in the fact that the United States, with the assistance of Chiang Kai-shek, seized several years ago, and continues to forcibly occupy, China's Taiwan Island and the Penghu Islands, as well as certain other Chinese islands.

We have also pointed out that the demand for a "ceasefire" in the coastal island areas of China is in reality nothing more than a conspiracy to force the People's Republic of China to abandon its sovereignty over Chinese territory—Taiwan and the Penghu Islands—and to consolidate the illegal occupation of these islands by the United States. In this situation, discussing the New Zealand proposal is futile. This discussion has not and cannot solve the problem facing the Security Council, namely, eliminating the root causes of tension in the Far East and eliminating the threat of war in that region.

The reply of the Government of the People's Republic of China fully confirms this assessment of the situation. The reply stated: "The United States' aggression against China's territory Taiwan has always been the source of tension in the Far East. Recently, after the United States signed the so-called 'Mutual Defense Treaty' with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, it has dispatched a large number of naval and air forces to Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area, openly engaging in war threats and war provocations against the Chinese people, and preparing to expand its aggression against China, further intensifying the tension in the Far East."

In this situation, it is not surprising that the Government of the People's Republic of China regards the New Zealand proposal to have the Security Council consider the issue of hostile actions in certain coastal island areas of China as a gross interference in China's internal affairs and a smokescreen to cover up the United States' aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China. At the same time, this proposal directly violates the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter.

The Chinese people's exercise of their sovereignty to liberate their territory is entirely China's internal affair, which has never caused international tension, nor can it threaten international peace and security.

The real root of tension in the Far East and the cause of the threat to international peace in that region is the United States' interference in China's internal affairs.

It is for this reason that the Soviet delegation has pointed out from the outset that the Security Council must urgently consider the Soviet proposal, which stipulates that the US government should immediately take measures to terminate its aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China and its interference in China's internal affairs, and immediately withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan and other territories belonging to China.

From the reply of the Government of the People's Republic of China, it can be seen that this proposal has received its warm support.

The purpose of the Soviet proposal is also to achieve an immediate ceasefire, as it provides for an appeal to either side to prevent hostilities in the Taiwan area in order to ensure the withdrawal of all armed forces not belonging to the People's Republic of China from the islands in that area.

There is a fundamental difference between the Soviet proposal and the New Zealand proposal on a "ceasefire" in the coastal islands of China. The drafters of the New Zealand proposal attempt to maintain the existing unsatisfactory situation in the Taiwan area and coastal islands, without considering the need to eliminate the root causes of the existing tension in that region. On the contrary, they even attempt to cover up these root causes.

The Soviet delegation has put forward a proposal that includes an appeal to either side to prevent hostilities in the Taiwan area, and raises the issue of not only achieving a ceasefire but also eliminating the root causes that exacerbate the dangerous international tension in the Far East, namely, terminating the US interference in China's internal affairs. It is not difficult to see what the real purpose behind the New Zealand proposal for a "ceasefire" in the Taiwan area is.

If we look at the remarks of authoritative figures such as the President of the United States, it is not difficult to understand this; from his message to the US Congress on January 24, it is clear that the United States wants to permanently separate Taiwan and the Penghu Islands from the People's Republic of China, and is doing all this under the guise of so-called peaceful steps aimed at easing tension and promoting a "ceasefire" in the region. Does the United States send not only its Seventh Fleet, but also other large armed forces—the number of which is increasing day by day—to this region for the so-called purposes? It is impossible to seriously say that the United States is genuinely trying to ease tension there by increasing its armed forces in the region. Is it not obvious that the United States needs to carry out a propaganda campaign about a "ceasefire" in this region only to cover up its aggressive conspiracy to occupy territory that has belonged to China since ancient times? However, some representatives in the Security Council hope to have the United Nations support this propaganda campaign and obediently offer its name and flag as a cover for the US's aggressive actions in this region; it is impossible for people to agree to this practice.

It is noteworthy that a representative of the British Foreign Office said on January 27 that if the Beijing government is prepared to stop hostilities on such a basis, that is, on the basis of the People's Republic of China abandoning its territory Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, Britain would support the People's Republic of China's claims to the coastal islands of Dachen, Matsu, and Kinmen (which have belonged to China since ancient times).

From the above statement, it can be seen that this propaganda campaign on "a ceasefire in the Taiwan Strait" has nothing in common with restoring peace in the Far East, and its sole purpose is to cover up the gross interference in China's internal affairs, and to cover up the demand that the People's Republic of China abandon its sovereignty over Taiwan and other Chinese territories. The actions of the United States fully expose the hypocritical nature of the "peace proposals," which in reality do not even express the slightest desire to normalize the dangerous situation occurring in the Far East.

As the United States continues to take aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China, the importance of the Soviet proposal, put forward on January 30, to prevent hostilities in the Taiwan area in order to immediately ease the dangerous tension in the Far East, is constantly increasing.

The US military is openly boasting that they have orders to attack aircraft of the People's Republic of China anywhere, including over Chinese territory and even over Chinese airports under the pretext of so-called "pursuit." The incident of February 9 illustrates the real danger to peace posed by such provocative actions, when a US military aircraft intruded into Chinese airspace and was shot down over Chinese territory by the air defense fire of the People's Republic of China.

Even President Eisenhower had to admit to the fact that US military aircraft illegally intruded into Chinese airspace. The incident of a group of US fighter planes attacking patrol planes of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in Korean airspace on February 5 should also be viewed from this perspective. Do these facts not very convincingly show that the danger contained in the provocative actions against the People's Republic of China, in which the US Air Force and Navy are participating, is increasing day by day?

Under these circumstances, the significance and importance of the recommendations put forward in the Soviet proposal of January 30 on the prevention of hostilities in the Taiwan area by either side, the purpose of which is to ensure the withdrawal of all armed forces not belonging to the People's Republic of China from the islands in that area, cannot be overestimated.

Today, it is very clear that the Security Council's consideration of the item proposed by New Zealand will not produce any constructive results in eliminating the threat of war in the Far East. However, the United Nations Charter entrusts the Security Council with the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security.

This raises a legitimate question: what action should the Security Council take to restore peace in the Taiwan area? Some representatives here have suggested adopting a wait-and-see attitude, that is, the Security Council should do nothing. It is impossible to agree to this suggestion.

We believe that the Security Council should immediately proceed to a discussion of the item proposed by the Soviet delegation on the issue of US aggression against the People's Republic of China. At the same time, the Security Council should invite the People's Republic of China to take its rightful seat in the Security Council, and before that, expel the Kuomintang elements who are illegally usurping this seat in violation of the United Nations Charter from the Security Council. I must remind the Security Council that when the issue of US aggression against the People's Republic of China was raised in the Security Council, the Soviet Union immediately suggested expelling the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek clique from the Security Council and allowing the representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend the Security Council as representatives of China. For this reason, I, as the Soviet representative, fully support the just proposal of the People's Republic of China to expel the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the Security Council and allow the representatives of the People's Republic of China to take its rightful seat in the Security Council. One cannot disagree with the statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China: "It is particularly intolerable that the People's Republic of China, representing six hundred million Chinese people, is still deprived of its legitimate status and rights in the United Nations, while the representatives of a small group of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique, who have long been abandoned by the Chinese people, are still usurping the position of representing China in the United Nations."

One can add that it is impossible to solve international problems without China's participation, especially in the Far East.

There is no doubt that when the Security Council boldly takes measures to stop US interference in China's internal affairs and rectify the shameful and unjust attitude towards the People's Republic of China (which is still deprived of the possibility of taking its rightful seat in the United Nations), the Security Council will easily achieve the easing of international tension in the Far East, and the threat to international peace and security in that region will disappear.

Based on the above considerations, the Soviet delegation moves that the Security Council decide to proceed to a discussion of item two on the agenda—on "US aggression against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan and other island areas of China."

### 二月十四日在联合国安全理事会会议上  苏联代表索波列夫的发言

专栏：

    二月十四日在联合国安全理事会会议上
    苏联代表索波列夫的发言
    安全理事会现在已经听取了若干国家的代表们的发言。他们都以这种或那种方式对中华人民共和国政府给安全理事会要它参加讨论新西兰代表团提出的议程项目的邀请的答复表示了不满意。
    但是很难认真地看待这种不满意、甚至“失望”的表示，因为实际上发言的代表之中差不多没有一位指望中华人民共和国政府会对向它提出的这个邀请给予肯定的答复，而且也不能指望这样的答复。举例说，从合众社的消息就可以看出这一点。这家通讯社二月三日的一条消息说，中华人民共和国的答复是令人失望的，但是不是完全出于意料之外的。
    的确，安全理事会是在什么情况之下作出邀请的决定的呢？邀请一位中华人民共和国的代表的目的何在呢？
    大家知道，安全理事会上一次会议的议程上包括两个项目：第一个项目是新西兰提出的关于“在中国大陆沿岸某些岛屿地区的敌对行动”问题，第二个项目是苏联提出的关于“美国在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为”。安全理事会里的多数决定首先讨论新西兰的建议，虽然这一决定显然没有考虑到远东局势的全部复杂性。
    苏联代表团已经指出，新西兰提出的主张审议中国大陆海岸附近某些岛屿地区的敌对行动问题的建议故意不提到造成在远东发展起来的紧张局势的根本原因。值得注意的是：今天发言的代表们都承认在远东存在着对和平的威胁。但是没有一位代表提到产生这种威胁的根源。讲到远东紧张局势的根源，那就在于：美国在蒋介石协助之下，在几年以前就劫夺了，而且继续用武力霸占着中国的台湾岛和澎湖列岛以及某些其他中国岛屿。
    我们也已经指出，关于在中国沿海岛屿地区
  “停火”的要求，实际上不过是一个要使中华人民共和国放弃它对中国领土——台湾和澎湖列岛的主权、并且巩固美国对这些岛屿的非法霸占的阴谋。在这种情况下，讨论新西兰的建议是无益的。这种讨论在过去和现在都不能使安全理事会所面临的问题，即消除造成远东紧张局势的根源、消除那一地区的战争威胁的问题得到解决。
    中华人民共和国政府的答复完全证实了这种对局势的估计。答复说：“美国对中国的领土台湾的侵略，一直是造成远东紧张局势的根源。最近，美国在同蒋介石卖国集团签订了所谓‘共同防御条约’以后，增派大批海空军到台湾和台湾海峡地区，公开对中国人民进行战争威胁和战争挑衅，准备扩大对中国的侵略，更加加剧了远东的紧张局势。”
    在这种情况下，中华人民共和国政府把新西兰提出的要安全理事会审议中国某些沿海岛屿地区的敌对行动问题的建议看作是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，是掩盖美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行动的烟幕，就是毫不奇怪的了。同时，这个建议还直接违反了联合国宪章的基本原则。
    中国人民行使他们的主权，解放他们的领土，完全是中国的内政，从来没有造成过国际的紧张局势，也不可能威胁国际和平和安全。
    造成远东紧张局势的真正根源和造成对那一地区的国际和平的威胁的原因是美国对中国内政的干涉。
    就是为了这个缘故，苏联代表团从一开始就曾经指出，安全理事会必须紧急审议苏联提出的提案，苏联提案规定，美国政府应该立即采取措施终止对中华人民共和国的侵略行为和它对中国内政的干涉，并且立即从台湾和属于中国的其他领土撤退它的一切武装部队。
    从中华人民共和国政府的答复中可以看到，这个建议已得到它的热烈支持。
    苏联的提案的目的也是为了立即实现停火，因为它规定吁请任何一方防止在台湾地区的敌对行动，以便保证不属于中华人民共和国的一切武装部队从那个地区的岛屿撤退。
    苏联的这个建议同新西兰的关于在中国沿海岛屿停火的建议之间有着根本的区别。新西兰建议的拟订者企图保持台湾地区和沿海岛屿现存的不能令人满意的局势，没有考虑到要消除造成那个地区的现存紧张局势的根源。相反地，他们还企图掩盖这些根源。
    苏联代表团提出了一个包含着吁请任何一方防止在台湾地区的敌对行动的建议，提出了不仅要实现停火、而且要消除使得远东危险的国际紧张局势加剧的根源、也就是终止美国对中国内政的干涉的问题。不难看出新西兰关于在台湾地区“停火”的建议的背后的真正目的是什么。
    如果我们看看像美国总统这样的权威人物的言论，那就不难了解这一点；从他在一月二十四日致美国国会的咨文中可以清楚地看出，美国想使台湾和澎湖列岛永远同中华人民共和国分离，并且是在据说目的为了是缓和这个地区的紧张局势和促成这个地区的“停火”的和平步骤的幌子下进行着这一切。美国不仅把它的第七舰队，而且还把其他一些庞大的武装部队——这些部队的数目正在一天比一天增加——派到这个地区去，难道是为了据说的那些目的吗？不可能认真地说美国增加它在这个地区的武装部队是真心为了要缓和那里的紧张局势。美国需要进行关于在这个地区“停火”的宣传运动，只是为了掩饰它要霸占那里自古以来就属于中国的领土的侵略阴谋，这难道不是很明显的吗？但是，安全理事会中的一些代表却希望使联合国支持这种宣传运动，并且乖乖地把它的名义和旗帜拿出来作为美国在这一个地区的侵略行动的掩饰；要人们同意这种做法是不可能的。
    值得注意的是，英国外交部的一位代表在一月二十七日说，如果北京政府准备在这样的一个基础上，就是说，在中华人民共和国放弃它的领土台湾和澎湖列岛的基础上停止敌对行动，英国就会支持中华人民共和国对沿海岛屿大陈、马祖和金门的要求（这些岛屿自古以来就是属于中国的）。
    从上面的声明可以看出：关于“在台湾海峡停火”的这一个宣传运动和恢复远东的和平毫无共同之处，它的唯一目的是要掩饰对中国内政的粗暴干涉，以及掩饰要中华人民共和国放弃它对台湾和其他中国领土的主权的要求。美国的行径充分暴露出“和平建议”的虚伪性质，实际上，这种建议甚至没有表示丝毫要使在远东发生的危险局势正常化的愿望。
    由于美国继续对中华人民共和国采取侵略行动，苏联提出的防止在台湾地区的敌对行动以便立即缓和危险的远东紧张局势的建议的重要性正在不断增加。
    美国军方公开夸口说，他们奉有命令可以在任何地方向中华人民共和国的飞机进攻，包括在所谓
  “追击”的借口下到中国领土上空、甚至在中国飞机场上空进行进攻。二月九日的事件说明了这种挑衅行动对和平的真正危险，当时一架美国军用飞机侵入中国领空，被中华人民共和国的防空炮火击落在中国领土上。
    即使艾森豪威尔总统也不得不承认美国军用飞机非法侵入中国领空的事实。对一群美国战斗机二月五日在朝鲜领空袭击朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的巡逻飞机一事，也应该从这个角度来看。难道这些事实不是非常令人信服地显示出由美国空军和海军参与的对中华人民共和国的挑衅行动所包含的危险是在日益增加吗？
    根据这些情况，对于苏联在一月三十日提出的关于任何一方防止在台湾地区的敌对行动的提案中所提出的建议的意义和重要性是无论怎样估计都不算过高的，这个建议的目的是保证不属于中华人民共和国的一切武装部队从这个地区的岛屿撤退。
    今天，大家都很清楚，安全理事会审议新西兰所提出的项目并不能在消除远东的战争威胁方面产生什么建设性的结果。但是，联合国宪章赋予了安全理事会以维持国际和平和安全的主要责任。
    这样就产生了一个正当的问题：为了恢复台湾地区的和平，安全理事会应该采取什么行动呢？有些代表在这里建议采取等待的态度，这就是说，安全理事会无所作为。同意这种建议是不可能的。
    我们认为，安全理事会应该立即转入对苏联代表团提出的关于美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为的问题的讨论。同时，安全理事会应该邀请中华人民共和国来取得它在安全理事会中的合法席位，并且在此之前把违反联合国宪章非法窃据这个席位的国民党分子从安全理事会中驱逐出去。我必须提醒安全理事会，当关于美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为问题一在安全理事会中提出时，苏联就曾经立即建议把蒋介石集团的代表从安全理事会驱逐出去，让中华人民共和国的代表作为中国的代表出席安全理事会。正因为如此，我，作为苏联代表，充分支持中华人民共和国提出的关于把蒋介石的代表从安全理事会驱逐出去、让中华人民共和国的代表取得在安全理事会中的合法席位的公正建议。人们不能不同意中华人民共和国政府的这种说法：“尤其令人不能容忍的是：代表六万万中国人民的中华人民共和国至今仍被剥夺了在联合国中的合法地位和权利，而早为中国人民所唾弃的一小撮蒋介石卖国集团残余分子的代表却仍然在联合国中窃据代表中国的地位。”
    人们可以补充一句说，没有中国参加就不可能解决国际问题，在远东方面特别是如此。
    毫无疑问，当安全理事会大胆地采取措施，以制止美国对中国内政的干涉和纠正对中华人民共和国的可耻的、不公正态度（中华人民共和国至今还被剥夺了它取得在联合国中的合法席位的可能性）的时候，安全理事会就会很容易地获致远东国际紧张局势的缓和，那个地区的国际和平和安全所遭受的威胁也就会消失。
    根据上述的考虑，苏联代表团动议，安全理事会决定转入关于议程第二项——关于“美国在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为”的讨论。
