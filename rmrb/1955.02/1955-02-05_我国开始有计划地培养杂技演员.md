China Begins to Systematically Train Acrobats

    The China Acrobatic Troupe has newly established a trainee team and begun to systematically train acrobats. After five years of study, the trainees will be cultivated into the first group of relatively well-rounded acrobatic art performers in our country.

    Currently, the more than thirty male and female trainees of the China Acrobatic Troupe trainee team are all teenagers aged twelve to fourteen. They have good maintenance conditions and fixed classrooms. After entering the school, they begin to practice the basic courses of acrobatic art, such as headstands, leg exercises, waist exercises, somersaults, and muscle training, with guidance and planning. At the same time, they also study dance, music, politics, culture, and other subjects. According to the plan, after the trainees have mastered the basic acrobatic movements in the third year of study, they will be divided into specialized training according to the development of their skills and talents and their personalities. In addition to inviting Chinese acrobats to teach, this trainee team will also specially invite Soviet dance experts to teach the basic movements of ballet.

    This trainee team was established in preparation for establishing a formal circus school in our country.

    我国开始有计划地培养杂技演员
    中国杂技团新成立了学员队，开始有计划地培养杂技演员。学员们经过五年的学习，将被培养成为我国第一批较为健全的杂技艺术表演者。
    现在，中国杂技团学员队的三十多名男女学员都是从十二岁到十四岁的少年。他们有良好的保养条件和固定的教室，入学后就开始有指导有计划地从顶、腿、腰、翻筋斗和肌肉锻炼等方面练习杂技艺术的基本课程；同时，还学习舞蹈、音乐、政治、文化等课。根据计划，学员们学习到第三年度掌握了杂技的基本的动作后，便依照他们技艺才能的发展情况和性格，分科进行专门培养。这个学员队除了请我国杂技演员任教外，还将特邀苏联舞蹈专家来教授巴蕾舞的基本动作。
    这个学员队是为了在我国建立正规的马戏学校作准备而成立的。
