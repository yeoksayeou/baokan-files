Xinhua News Agency, 5th Dispatch: More facts prove that the United States is supporting some Laotian armed forces in attacking the Lao Fighting Units.

Some Laotian armed forces, equipped by the United States, attacked Muang Phun in Sam Neua Province, a rallying area for the Lao Fighting Units, from December 31, 1954 to January 2, 1955. This was at a time when the Royal Lao Government and the Lao Fighting Units were preparing to hold political talks. The food and ammunition for these troops were supplied by American aircraft. They built fortifications and prepared to turn Muang Phun into a military stronghold.

Among the parachutes dropped by American aircraft captured by the Lao Fighting Units were three letters from Dao Vongkongkham, one of the masterminds of the Muang Phun incident now in Vientiane, to his accomplices in Muang Phun.

In a letter to Dao Yi, one of his henchmen in Muang Phun, Dao Vongkongkham said: We don't have to worry about rice, salt, clothing and equipment. Secret contact has already been made with the United States. The United States will help us in every way and will help us easily wipe out the Lao forces. He also said that the ammunition and weapons for them will be dropped at Pian Kham.

In two other letters, Dao Vongkongkham instructed his henchmen to step up their attacks on the Lao Fighting Units.

The above-mentioned attack on the Lao Fighting Units, Dao Vongkongkham's letters, and the recent military operations near the Sam Neua and Phongsaly assembly areas all prove the perfidious conspiracy of the American imperialists and their followers, who are attempting to gradually encroach on the assembly areas of the Lao Fighting Units, obstruct all political negotiations, and undermine the Laotian armistice agreement.

    美国在老挝阴谋活动的罪证
    【新华社五日讯】据越南通讯社报道：更多的事实证明美国在支持老挝的一些武装部队进攻寮国战斗部队。
    若干由美国装备的老挝武装部队在从一九五四年十二月三十一日到一九五五年一月二日的期间进攻了寮国战斗部队集结地区桑怒省的芒奔。这是正当老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队准备举行政治会议的时候。这些军队的粮食和弹药都由美国飞机供应。他们筑起了防御工事，并且准备把芒奔变成一个军事据点。
    在被寮国战斗部队缴获的美国飞机所空投的降落伞中，发现了现在万象的芒奔事件策动者之一道冯空堪给他在芒奔的同谋者的三封信。
    道冯空堪在给他在芒奔的党徒之一道异的信中说：我们不用担心大米、盐、服装和装备。已经在和美国进行秘密联系。美国将从各方面来帮助我们，并且将帮助我们轻而易举地把寮国部队消灭掉。他还说，给他们的弹药、武器将在片坎地方空投下来。
    道冯空堪在另外两封信中指示他的党徒加紧进攻寮国战斗部队。
    上述的对于寮国战斗部队的进攻、道冯空堪的信件以及最近在桑怒和丰沙里集结区附近的军事行动，都证明了美帝国主义者和它的追随者们的背信弃义的阴谋，他们企图逐步侵犯寮国战斗部队的集结地区，阻挠一切的政治谈判，破坏老挝停战协定。
