He said: "The people of Zhejiang Province are constantly concerned about the soldiers on the coastal defense front. You are valiantly defending the socialist construction of the motherland and the happy life of the people. The great victory in liberating Yijiangshan Island has more forcefully struck at the US-Chiang war treaty and encouraged the production enthusiasm of the people of the motherland. The people of Zhejiang Province hope that you will continue to maintain high vigilance, study hard, strengthen training, give the Chiang bandit troops an even more severe blow, and resolutely struggle to completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and liberate the coastal islands and Taiwan!"

He called on all units to maintain and carry forward their glory, to avoid arrogance and complacency, and to fight to the end to defend the socialist construction of the motherland and liberate the coastal islands and Taiwan. Yu Zhongcheng, an army soldier who was awarded a first-class merit in the battle to liberate Yijiangshan Island, and Liu Dong, an air force third-class merit recipient, also expressed heartfelt gratitude for the warm support and concern of the people of the motherland at the meeting, and promised to study hard, improve tactical skills, and respond to the people of the motherland with even greater victories.
