    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang—State-owned machinery factories in Shenyang are taking various measures to strive for the comprehensive completion of their first-quarter production plans. Many state-owned machinery factories are paying attention to strengthening preparations before production, such as blueprints, tool cards, and process regulations. The Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant held a forum for section-level management cadres and technical personnel to specifically study the production situation in the first quarter and assigned each section to solve problems according to their nature. To ensure the production of eleven new products, the Shenyang Mining Machinery Plant has formulated work plans separately and actively organized personnel to obtain product drawings from ordering units. The Shenyang Low-Voltage Switch Factory, which had poor product quality in the past, proposed to strengthen the inspection of finished products and send people to factories producing electrical switch equipment to learn, in addition to improving the production preparation and trial production of new products. In order to ensure the completion of the order for electrical control equipment for the Guanting Reservoir Hydropower Station, the Shenyang High-Voltage Switch Factory designated engineers, technicians, and veteran workers to form a specialized team to be specifically responsible for the production of these products.
    Some factories have changed the phenomenon of slack production at the beginning of the year that occurred in previous years, and their production tasks have been completed better than at the beginning of previous years. Although the production task of the Shenyang Air Compressor Factory in the first quarter of this year has increased compared with the past, the plan was completed according to schedule in the first ten days of January. The forging workshop of this factory completed the production plan for January nine days ahead of schedule.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin—In January, 104 factories in Tianjin completed their production plans, and the products of these factories are being shipped to various places. The time for the Tianjin Steel Plant to smelt a furnace of steel was shortened by more than twelve minutes compared to the plan. The entire month increased steel ingot production by more than 300 tons, setting a record for the highest monthly output since liberation. The output of ribbed steel, round steel, and flat steel produced in January for 98 units, including the Shenyang Heavy Machinery Plant and Benxi Iron and Steel Company, also exceeded the plan. Local state-owned factories under the Heavy Industry Bureau manufactured more than 50 kinds of new products and adopted new specifications of products. Among them, the one-ton steel pusher, urea storage tank, and hand-cranked beam crane were all ordered by key national projects. The quality of light industrial products, such as matches, bamboo shell thermos bottles, rubber shoes, bicycle tires, and enamelware, which are supplied in large quantities to rural areas in North China, has improved.
    The factory workers continue to work hard to save. The three state-owned cotton textile factories saved more than 76,000 jin of cotton in January because the amount of cotton used was lower than planned. The local state-owned Tianjin Glass Factory successfully used silica sand instead of quartz powder to make daily-use glass. The price of each ton of silica sand is half the price of quartz powder.

    沈阳各国营机械工厂加强生产准备工作
    争取全面完成第一季度生产计划
    天津市有一百多个工厂按期完成一月份计划
    【新华社沈阳讯】沈阳市各国营机械工厂正在采取各种措施，争取全面完成第一季度生产计划。不少国营机械工厂都注意加强了生产前的图纸、工卡具、工艺规程等各项准备工作。沈阳重型机器厂曾召开科室管理干部和技术人员的座谈会，专门研究第一季度生产情况，并按问题的性质分别指定各科、室加以解决。沈阳矿山机器厂为保证十一种新产品的生产，分别编制了作业计划，并主动地组织专人到订货单位索取产品图样。过去产品质量较差的沈阳低压开关厂，除了要改进新产品生产准备工作和试制工作外，还提出要加强成品的检查，并派人到生产电气开关设备的工厂去学习。沈阳高压开关厂为保证完成官厅水库水力发电站电气控制设备的订货任务，指定由工程师、技术员和老工人等组织了专业小组，专门负责这些产品的制作。
    有些工厂因为今年已改变了往年年初生产松劲的现象，生产任务较往年年初完成的好。沈阳空气压缩机厂今年第一季度生产任务虽然比过去增加了，但今年一月份的上中旬都按照进度完成了计划。这个工厂的锻工车间并提前九天完成了一月份的生产计划。
    【新华社天津讯】一月份，天津市有一百零四个工厂完成了生产计划，这些工厂的产品正陆续运往各地。国营天津钢厂炼一炉钢的时间比计划缩短了十二分钟以上，全月增产钢锭三百多吨，创造了解放以来月产量的最高纪录。一月份为沈阳重型机器厂、本溪钢铁公司等九十八个单位生产的竹节钢、元钢、扁钢等钢材的产量，也超过了计划。重工业局所属地方国营工厂制造了五十多种新产品和采用新规格的产品。其中一吨推钢机、流胺贮槽、手摇梁式吊车等都是国家重点工程的订货。大量供应华北农村的轻工业产品，火柴、竹壳暖水瓶、胶鞋、自行车胎、搪瓷用品的质量都有改进。
    各工厂职工们继续努力节约。三个国营棉纺织厂因为用棉量比计划降低，全月节约棉花七万六千多斤。地方国营天津市玻璃厂用矽砂代替石英粉做日用玻璃成功。每一吨矽砂的价钱比石英粉便宜一半。
