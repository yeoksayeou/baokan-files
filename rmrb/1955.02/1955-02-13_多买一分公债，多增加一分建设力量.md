    Buy one more share of government bonds, add one more share of construction power
    This is a glorious obligation Editor:
    On December 26th last year, the fourth day after the promulgation of the "1955 National Economic Construction Bond Regulations," three hundred and forty-nine male and female members of the China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm in Changzhi, Shanxi Province, gathered at the farm management department for a discussion. After the discussion, everyone realized that in order to build socialism and create a happy and fulfilling life, it is necessary to realize socialist industrialization. The national construction undertaking requires a large amount of funds, and issuing national economic construction bonds is one of the best ways to accumulate these funds. The country's industrialization is closely related to the socialist transformation of agriculture. Funds supporting industrial construction also support the development of their own farms. Many farmers have a deep feeling for this. The output of our farm has increased year by year. In 1953, an average of eleven and a half catties of grain were distributed per work day. After using tractors for cultivation, it increased to more than thirteen catties in 1954. With the development of production, the lives of farmers have also generally improved. This is the benefit that industrial construction brings to farmers. Through this issuance of bonds, many farmers have further realized that the interests of the state and the interests of the individual are completely consistent. We temporarily provide our surplus money to the country for construction, which on the one hand increases the country's construction funds; on the other hand, it can also promote our own savings and develop a good habit of thrift. In the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds, the number allocated to farmers, excluding the population in the flood-stricken areas, is only 4,000 yuan per person on average. This is not a large number, and this money is nothing to the country's farmers. As long as our country's farmers save a little, they can assume the glorious obligation of accumulating funds for national construction.
    The male and female members of the Changzhi China-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm fully support the state's measures to issue the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds. Everyone is determined to express their concern and support for the country's construction undertaking with practical actions to actively subscribe to bonds by doing a good job in increasing production and practicing economy.

     The money must be used properly Editor:
    When I heard the news of the issuance of the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds, I was very happy. I think that the issuance of economic construction bonds this time has significant political and economic significance. This can not only accumulate more funds for national construction, but also provide a vivid and powerful patriotic and socialist education to the broad masses of the people. The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has issued a notice calling on all officers and soldiers of the army to enthusiastically subscribe to the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds. I firmly respond to this call and enthusiastically subscribe according to my own economic conditions.
    The broad masses of commanders and fighters of our Chinese People's Liberation Army have developed a fine style of hard work and plain living in the long years of combat. This year, the cadres of our Liberation Army have begun to implement the salary system, and their living standards have improved compared to before; however, I must continue to carry forward this fine tradition, use money appropriately, save it to buy bonds, and add a share of strength to the country's construction undertaking.
    When we are living a happy and joyful life and engaged in peaceful construction, we cannot help but think of our compatriots in Taiwan who are still living a very painful life under the bloody rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. We must subscribe to more bonds, accelerate the pace of national construction, support the liberation of Taiwan, completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and enable our Taiwan compatriots to return to the embrace of the motherland and live the same happy life as us.　Dang Baoqiang
  When the wish comes true Editor:
    When a wish is realized, the feeling of joy is hard to describe. Today, I am welcoming the issuance of national economic construction bonds with such a mood.
    Building our country into a socialist country is the great ideal of the people of the whole country for many years. Who is unwilling to contribute their strength to building a peaceful and happy life? For this reason, we work diligently, trying to add a share of strength to the country's construction undertaking in our own work. I often calculate how to use money reasonably, save the surplus money and invest it in the national construction undertaking. In order to accumulate construction funds for the country, I have been preparing for a long time. Now that the national economic construction bonds have been issued, how can I not be happy? Buying one more share of government bonds will add more construction funds to the country; adding more strength to defend peace and fight aggressors!　Chen Qi'ai

### 多买一分公债，多增加一分建设力量

    多买一分公债，多增加一分建设力量
    这是一件光荣的义务编辑同志：
    去年十二月二十六日，“一九五五年国家经济建设公债条例”公布后的第四天，山西长治中苏友好集体农庄的三百四十九个男女庄员在农庄管理部集会进行了座谈。经过讨论以后，大家都认识到要建设社会主义，创造幸福美满的生活，就必须实现社会主义工业化，国家的建设事业要大量的资金，而发行国家经济建设公债就是积累这种资金的最好方法之一。国家的工业化对于农业的社会主义改造有着密切的关系，支援工业建设的资金，也就是支援了自己农庄的发展。对于这一点，许多庄员都有深切的感受。我们农庄的产量一年比一年提高了。一九五三年，一个劳动日平均分十一斤十二两粮食，在使用拖拉机耕种以后，一九五四年就提高到十三斤多。随着生产的发展，农民的生活也普遍改善了。这就是工业建设给予农民的好处。许多庄员通过这次发行公债，更进一步认识了国家利益和个人利益是完全一致的。我们把自己多余的钱暂时供给国家进行建设，一方面增加了国家建设的资金；另一方面，也可以促使自己储蓄，养成节约的好习惯。一九五五年国家经济建设公债中，分配给农民的数字，除去水灾区的人口，每人平均不过四千元。这是一个不大的数字，这些钱放在全国农民的身上简直算不了什么。我们全国农民只要稍稍节约一些，就可以担负起对于国家建设积累资金的光荣义务。
    长治中苏友好集体农庄的男女庄员们完全拥护国家发行一九五五年国家经济建设公债的措施。大家都决心以做好增产节约工作积极认购公债的实际行动，来表示对国家建设事业的关心和支援。  金盾、挺荣、之俊
     要把钱用得适当编辑同志：
    当我听到发行一九五五年国家经济建设公债的消息时，心里非常高兴。我想，这次发行经济建设公债是有着重大政治意义和经济意义的。这不仅可以为国家建设事业积累更多的资金，而且对广大的人民群众也是一次生动有力的爱国主义和社会主义教育。中国人民解放军总政治部已经发出通知，号召全军干部热烈认购一九五五年国家经济建设公债，我坚决响应这一号召，根据自己的经济条件踊跃认购。
    我们中国人民解放军的广大指战员，在长期的战斗生活中养成了艰苦朴素的优良作风。今年我们解放军的干部已经开始实行薪金制，生活水平比以前提高了；但是，我一定要继续发扬这种优良的传统，把钱用得适当，节省下来购买公债，为国家的建设事业增加一分力量。
    当我们过着幸福愉快的生活，从事和平建设的时候，我们不能不想到台湾的同胞还在蒋介石卖国集团的血腥统治下，过着非常惨痛的生活。我们更要多多认购公债，加速国家建设速度，支援解放台湾，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团，使台湾同胞能回到祖国怀抱，过着和我们同样的幸福生活。　党宝强
  当着愿望实现的时候编辑同志：
    当着心愿一旦实现的时候，那种愉快的心情是很难描述的。今天，我就是以这样的心情来迎接国家发行经济建设公债的。
    把我国建设成一个社会主义国家，这是全国人民多少年来的伟大理想，谁不愿意为建设和平幸福的生活而贡献自己的力量呢？为着这个，我们兢兢业业地工作着，设法在自己的工作上为国家的建设事业增加一分力量。我常常计算着怎样把钱用得合理，节省下多余的钱投到国家建设事业中去。为了替国家积累建设资金，已经准备很久了，今天国家经济建设公债发行了，我怎么能不高兴呢？多买一分公债，就多增加一些国家的建设资金；多增加一分保卫和平、打击侵略者的力量！　陈琦瑷
