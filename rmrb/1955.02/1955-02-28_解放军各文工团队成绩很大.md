The People's Liberation Army's various cultural work troupes (teams) have achieved many successes in implementing the policy of "facing the companies, serving the soldiers" in their artistic work.

    Many cultural work troupes (teams) of the People's Liberation Army have gone deep into the companies to perform, carrying forward the fine tradition of PLA artists of being hard-working and simple, overcoming difficulties, and enthusiastically serving the soldiers. The cultural troupes of the Central South Military Region went deep into remote areas and the front lines of the coastal defense troops to hold touring performances, with an average distance of more than four thousand miles per troupe. After a certain unit of the East China Military Region shelled the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on Jinmen Island, the cultural work troupes (teams) of the frontline troops immediately rushed to the front positions to hold慰问performances for the artillery soldiers. They carried out small-scale singing activities of "taking materials on the spot" and "composing and performing immediately" on the positions, singing praises of victory and the heroic figures that emerged in the battle, which greatly encouraged the frontline troops. Some cultural work troupes (teams) even crossed the sea to the islands at the forefront of coastal defense to hold 慰问performances for the troops guarding the islands. There, the members often lit candles at night and sang to the soldiers in the fortifications. The members of a cultural work team of a certain unit of the Southwest Military Region walked more than three thousand miles in three months to hold慰问performances for the border defense troops guarding the border, and also to guide the companies in carrying out recreational activities. According to incomplete statistics, in the past year, the number of performances by professional cultural work troupes (teams) of ten units of the People's Liberation Army totaled more than 11,600, which was a significant increase compared with the previous year.

    On the basis of going deep into the troops and experiencing life, the cultural work troupes (teams) of the People's Liberation Army have not only significantly improved their professional level, but also created many excellent songs, scripts, dances, etc. that promote patriotism and revolutionary heroism, greatly enriching the repertoire. In the past year, the dances "Army Waist Drum," "Tibetan Cavalry," "慰问 on the Position," (songs) "Little River Flowing," "Sisters, Come On," "The Company is Our Lovely Home," scripts "Ten Thousand Waters and Thousand Mountains," "The Battle Line Shifts South," "Breaking Through the Darkness Before Dawn," and "The Forefront of the East China Sea" created by the troops' cultural workers have been warmly welcomed by the commanders and fighters.

    The cultural work troupes (teams) of the People's Liberation Army also frequently give demonstration performances to the soldiers' amateur performance teams and help the companies carry out club work. Many cultural work troupes (teams) hold training courses to train a large number of backbone elements for the troops' amateur cultural activities in music, dance, storytelling, fine arts, and other fields. In the past year alone, the cultural work troupes (teams) affiliated to the Public Security Forces have trained more than 3,600 cultural backbones, which has played a great role in enlivening the troops' cultural life.

    解放军各文工团队成绩很大
    中国人民解放军各部队文艺工作团（队）在贯彻“面向连队、为兵服务”的文艺工作方针的活动中，取得了许多成绩。
    人民解放军的许多文艺工作团（队）都深入连队进行演出的活动，发扬了部队文艺工作者艰苦朴素、克服困难和热心为兵服务的优良传统。中南军区各文艺工作团深入边远地区和海防前线各部队举行巡回演出，平均每个团的行程都在四千里以上。华东军区前线部队文艺工作团（队）在某部炮击金门岛蒋贼军后，立刻赶到前线各阵地为炮兵战士们举行慰问演出。他们在阵地上开展了“就地取材”
  “即编即演”的小型演唱活动，歌颂了胜利，歌颂了战斗中出现的英雄人物，给前线部队很大鼓舞。有一些文艺工作团（队）还越海到海防最前哨的岛屿上，为守卫海岛的部队举行慰问演出。在那里，团员们常常在夜间燃起蜡烛，在工事内向战士们演唱。西南军区某部文艺工作队的队员们三个月步行了三千多里，为守卫国境线的边防部队举行慰问演出，并且辅导连队开展文娱活动。据不完全统计，在去年一年内，人民解放军十个单位的专业文艺工作团（队）演出场数共计在一万一千六百场以上，比前年演出场数大大增多。
    人民解放军各文艺工作团（队）在深入部队、体验生活的基础上，不仅业务水平有了显著提高，而且创作了宣扬爱国主义、革命英雄主义思想的许多优秀的歌曲、剧本、舞蹈等，大大丰富了上演节目。去年一年中部队文艺工作者创作的舞蹈“陆军腰鼓”、“藏民骑兵队”、“阵地上的慰问”、
  （歌曲）“小河淌水”、“姐妹们，来呀”、“连队是我们可爱的家”、剧本“万水千山”、“战线南移”、“冲破黎明前的黑暗”、“东海最前线”等，都受到部队指挥员、战斗员的热烈欢迎。
    人民解放军各文艺工作团（队）还经常向战士业余演出队作示范演出和帮助连队开展俱乐部工作。许多文艺工作团（队）举办训练班，培养出大批音乐、舞蹈、说唱、美术等方面的部队业余文艺活动骨干。仅公安部队所属各文艺工作团（队）在过去一年内就培养了三千六百多名文艺骨干，对活跃部队文艺生活起了很大作用。　（新华社）
