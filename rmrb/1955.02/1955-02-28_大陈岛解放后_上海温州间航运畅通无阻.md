Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, February 27th: After the liberation of Dachen Island, shipping between Shanghai and Wenzhou is now unimpeded. Local and special products from the coastal areas of Zhejiang Province, such as rice, alum, leather, and dried sweet potatoes, are being transported from ports like Wenzhou and Haimen to Shanghai in a steady stream. Recently, ships sailing from north to south have also been fully loaded with daily necessities, hardware, medicines, and flour produced in Shanghai, along with more than 1,000 tons of fertilizer and 2,000 boxes of "666" insecticide powder, to supply farmers in the coastal areas of Zhejiang.

    据新华社上海二十七日电：大陈岛解放以后，上海与温州间的航运已畅通无阻。浙江省沿海地区出产的大米、明矾、皮革、地瓜干等土产品和特产品，正从温州、海门等港口源源运来上海。最近由北向南航行的船只，也满载着上海生产的日用百货、五金器材、药品、面粉等商品，并有一千多吨肥田粉、两千箱“六六六”杀虫药粉，供应浙江沿海地区的农民。
