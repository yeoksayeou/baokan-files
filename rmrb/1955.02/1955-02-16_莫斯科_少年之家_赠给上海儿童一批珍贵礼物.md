Moscow "Children's Home" Presents Shanghai Children with a Batch of Precious Gifts
	On February 13th, five hundred and some Young Pioneers in Shanghai held a meeting at the "Children's Palace" to receive gifts from the Moscow "Children's Home." To express their gratitude to the Soviet children for their care and assistance, the children of Shanghai wrote a letter of thanks to the Moscow "Children's Home" on February 13th. Last December, the Moscow "Children's Home" sent a batch of precious gifts to the children of Shanghai. This batch of gifts totaled 266 items, valued at 80,000 rubles. Inside were airplane model materials, electric teletype machines, electric telegraph machines, small lathes, small sawing machines, movie projectors, radios, cameras, precision instruments, radio demonstration boards, tools for fitters and carpenters, all equipment and materials for children to learn and study science. The children of Shanghai were very happy to receive these gifts, especially the members of the science research group at the Shanghai "Children's Palace," who showed great interest in them. To celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, the children of Shanghai decided to hold a "Soviet Gift Exhibition" at the "Children's Palace" starting on the 16th of this month. These gifts, along with the large number of gifts that Soviet friends have given to the children of Shanghai since the establishment of the Shanghai "Children's Palace" more than two years ago, will be publicly exhibited for all the children of the city to see and learn from.
