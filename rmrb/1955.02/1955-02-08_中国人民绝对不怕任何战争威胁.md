The Chinese People Absolutely Fear No War Threats
Jiang Yuanchun

On February 5th, the US State Department's statement announced that the United States would use its Seventh Fleet and "other American forces" to prevent the Chinese people from annihilating the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops entrenched on Dachen Island, and to assist these Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in escaping from Dachen Island. In explaining this statement, a Washington naval spokesman blatantly reversed right and wrong, stating that the Chinese people's action to liberate Dachen Island "will be interpreted by the United States as interference with the mission of the Seventh Fleet," and therefore "may be subject to retaliation from the United States."

Thus, the United States is not only supporting and aiding the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in attacking the Chinese people, but also directly using its armed forces to participate in the military actions of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. This action by the United States is clearly intended to exacerbate the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait in order to further its aggression.

Moreover, the US State Department's statement also stated that the United States will assist the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to "defend" "relevant positions and territories" now in the hands of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits "that the United States considers essential for the defense of Taiwan and Penghu." This proves that the United States' occupation of Taiwan and Penghu is not satisfying it. It also wants to create excuses to occupy our coastal islands and expand its aggression against China. US Assistant Secretary of State Morton publicly said on the 4th that "if the development of the situation shows that the Chinese Communists intend to use certain coastal islands or nearby areas as a springboard for attacking Taiwan, the President will have the clear authority to order appropriate actions."

The United States' direct participation in the military actions of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops and the expansion of its occupation to our coastal islands further threatens peace and security in the Far East and the Western Pacific. However, the US State Department insists that its actions are "conducive to the restoration of peace and security in the Western Pacific." People know that the US government's war messages have said that for the sake of the so-called "peace and security in the Western Pacific" of the United States, it is necessary to construct a so-called "island chain" encircling China. It seems that the United States' so-called island chain is not enough. It also wants to hang China's coastal islands on this "island chain," build military bases for attacking the Chinese people all the way to the edge of the Chinese mainland, and actively prepare for a new war. The purpose of the United States is certainly not for the peace and security of the Western Pacific, but to undermine peace and security.

This step towards war by the US government is part of the US's overall plan to prepare for war in the Far East and exacerbate the tense situation. The US air and naval forces have been carrying out war provocations against the Chinese coast for a long time. While intensifying these war provocations, the United States is plotting a so-called United Nations-arranged ceasefire, attempting to prove that the United States does not want war, and describing the United States' assistance to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in their escape as creating a so-called "de facto ceasefire." It is very clear that the United States' conspiracy is to use hypocritical words of "peace" to deceive and numb world opinion, and to cover up the steps the United States is taking to expand aggression and prepare for war.

The Chinese people, with their glorious tradition of resisting aggression, are absolutely not afraid of any war threats. China's coastal islands, including Taiwan and Penghu, have been Chinese territory since ancient times. For the sake of China's security and world peace, the Chinese people must liberate all coastal islands and Taiwan and Penghu. No war threat can stop this. The US government must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising from the US's direct participation in the military actions of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and its occupation of Chinese coastal islands.

    中国人民绝对不怕任何战争威胁
    蒋元椿
    二月五日，美国国务院的声明宣布，美国要用它的第七舰队和“其他的美国部队”阻挠中国人民歼灭盘踞在大陈岛上的蒋贼军，协助这些蒋贼军从大陈岛逃跑。华盛顿的海军发言人在解释这个声明时，公然颠倒是非，表示中国人民解放大陈岛的行动“将被美国解释为是干涉第七舰队的任务”，因而“可能遭到美国方面的报复”。
    这样，美国就不仅仅是支持和援助蒋介石卖国集团进攻中国人民，而且还要直接用它的武装力量参预蒋介石卖国集团的军事行动。美国的这一行动，显然是有意加剧台湾海峡的紧张局势，以便它进一步进行侵略。
    不仅如此，美国国务院的声明还表示，美国将援助蒋介石卖国集团来“保卫”现在在蒋贼手中“而美国认为是保卫台湾和澎湖所必不可少的有关的阵地和领土”，这就证明美国侵占了台湾和澎湖，它并不觉得满足。它还要制造借口来侵占我国沿海岛屿，并扩大对中国的侵略。美国助理国务卿摩顿在四日就公然说，“如果情况的发展表明中国共产党打算利用某些沿海岛屿或者附近地区作为攻击台湾的跳板的话，总统将有明确的权力下令采取适当的行动。”
    美国直接参预蒋贼军的军事行动，把美国的侵占行为扩大到我国沿海岛屿，使远东和西太平洋的和平和安全受到进一步的威胁。但是美国国务院却硬说它的这些行动是“有助于西太平洋的和平和安全的恢复”的。人们知道，美国政府战争咨文曾说过，为了美国的所谓“西太平洋的和平和安全”，就要构筑一条包围中国的所谓“岛屿锁链”。看来美国的所谓岛屿锁链还不够数。它还要把中国沿海岛屿也挂在这条“岛屿锁链”上，把进攻中国人民的军事基地一直筑到中国大陆的边缘上，积极准备新的战争。美国的目的当然不是为了西太平洋的和平和安全，而是为了破坏和平和安全。
    美国政府这一走向战争的步骤，是美国在远东准备战争，加剧紧张局势的总计划中的一部分。美国的海空军已经对中国沿海进行了长时期的战争挑衅。而和加紧这种战争挑衅的行为同时，美国却在策划进行所谓联合国安排停火，企图证明美国不要战争，并且把美国协助蒋贼军逃跑的行动说是造成了所谓“事实上的停火”。十分明显，美国的阴谋是用虚伪的“和平”字眼来欺骗和麻痹世界舆论，掩饰美国扩大侵略、准备战争的步骤。
    有着反抗侵略的光荣传统的中国人民是绝对不怕任何战争威胁的。中国的沿海岛屿，包括台湾、澎湖在内，从古以来就是中国的领土。为了中国的安全和世界和平，中国人民一定要解放一切沿海岛屿和台湾、澎湖，这是任何战争威胁所阻止不了的。对于因美国直接参预蒋介石卖国集团的军事行动和侵占中国沿海岛屿的行为所将引起的一切后果，美国政府必须担负全部责任。
