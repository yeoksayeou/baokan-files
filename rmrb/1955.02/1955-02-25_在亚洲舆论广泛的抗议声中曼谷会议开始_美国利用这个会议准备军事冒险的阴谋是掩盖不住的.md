Xinhua News Agency, February 24th, Bangkok: The Manila Treaty Organization conference convened by the United States began on the morning of the 23rd in Bangkok, Thailand. Representatives from eight countries are participating in this conference: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines.

This conference is being held amidst widespread protests from Asian public opinion. To deceive public opinion, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, in his speech at the opening ceremony open to the public on the morning of the 23rd, tried his best to conceal the aggressive and bellicose nature of U.S. foreign policy. According to him, the U.S. organizing military blocs in Asia, Europe, and the Americas, establishing military bases, and interfering in the internal affairs of other countries were not for the purpose of enslaving others, but rather to "bring freedom to others." Dulles also attempted to conceal the military and aggressive nature of the Manila Treaty in his speech.

British Foreign Secretary Eden and French representative Bonnet's speeches basically followed Dulles' line, feigning peace. The role of openly expressing war-mongering remarks was taken on by the smaller allies of the United States. Australian Foreign Minister Casey, in his speech, clamored for concrete measures to suppress the national liberation movements in Asia.

However, the hypocritical remarks made by the United States and its followers cannot conceal the U.S.'s aggressive plot. In a speech at a closed-door meeting held after the opening ceremony, Dulles immediately revealed the true goals the U.S. is pursuing at the Bangkok Conference.

News reports reveal that Dulles, in the closed-door meeting, demanded that other countries join the United States in strengthening their aggressive military forces in Asia to prepare for new military adventures. Dulles suggested immediately holding a meeting of the military chiefs of the eight Manila Treaty countries to discuss and formulate a so-called "overall military plan." Dulles vigorously emphasized the myth of the so-called "communist threat," attempting to use this to make the U.S.'s allies follow the U.S.'s war policy. Reuters reported that some conference attendees believed that Dulles' words "effectively demanded that the signatories of the Manila Treaty provide actual support to give the treaty more strength."

In the closed-door meeting, Dulles also demanded that his allies unconditionally support the U.S.'s policy of aggression against Taiwan. Dulles clamored to "regard the situations in Southeast Asia, Taiwan, and Korea as part of the overall situation," demanding that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and the Syngman Rhee clique "more formally" participate in the Manila Treaty Organization.

News reports say that Dulles also talked about intervention in Indochina in his speech. He once again openly violated the Geneva Accords, demanding that South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia be drawn into the Manila Treaty Group. Dulles stated that the U.S. is determined to continue to support Ngo Dinh Diem's reign of terror in South Vietnam, preparing to sabotage the free elections stipulated by the Geneva Accords.

    在亚洲舆论广泛的抗议声中曼谷会议开始
    美国利用这个会议准备军事冒险的阴谋是掩盖不住的
    【新华社二十四日讯】曼谷消息：美国召集的马尼拉条约国家会议已经在二十三日上午在泰国的曼谷开幕。参加这次会议的有美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、巴基斯坦、泰国、菲律宾八个国家的代表。
    这次会议是在亚洲舆论广泛的抗议声中召开的。为了欺骗舆论，美国国务卿杜勒斯在二十三日上午公开举行的会议开幕式上发表的演说中，竭力掩饰美国外交政策的侵略性和好战性。按照他的说法，美国在亚洲、欧洲、美洲组织军事集团、建立军事基地、干涉他国内政等行动，不是为了奴役别人，反而是为了“使别人得到自由”。杜勒斯在演说中还企图掩饰马尼拉条约的军事侵略性质。
    英国外交大臣艾登、法国代表庞纳的发言，基本上追随着杜勒斯的路线，伪装和平。公然发表好战言论的角色，是由美国的较小盟国担任的。澳大利亚外交部长凯西就在发言中叫嚣采取具体措施来镇压亚洲的民族解放运动。
    但是，美国和它的追随者发表的伪善言论，掩盖不住美国的侵略阴谋。杜勒斯在开幕式结束后举行的秘密会议上发表的演说中，立刻暴露出美国在曼谷会议上追逐的真正目标。
    消息透露，杜勒斯在秘密会议上要求其他国家和美国一道，加强在亚洲的侵略性军事力量，准备新的军事冒险。杜勒斯建议立刻举行马尼拉条约八个国家的军事首脑的会议，讨论制订所谓“总的军事计划”问题。杜勒斯竭力强调所谓“共产主义威胁”的神话，企图借此使美国的盟国追随美国战争政策。路透社的消息说，有些会议人士认为，杜勒斯这些话“实际上是要求马尼拉条约签字国以实际的支持来给这个条约以更多的力量”。
    杜勒斯在秘密会议上还要求他的盟国无保留地支持美国侵略台湾的政策。杜勒斯叫嚣“把东南亚、台湾和朝鲜的形势都看作是整个形势的一部分”，要求让蒋介石卖国集团和李承晚集团“较为正式地”参加马尼拉条约组织。
    消息说，杜勒斯在发言中还谈到了干涉印度支那问题。他又一次公然违反日内瓦协议，要求把南越、老挝、柬埔寨拉入马尼拉条约集团。杜勒斯表示美国决心继续支持吴庭艳在南越的恐怖统治，准备破坏日内瓦协议所规定的自由选举。
