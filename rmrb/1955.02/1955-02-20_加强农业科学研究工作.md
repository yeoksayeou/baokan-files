Strengthening Agricultural Scientific Research

In the past few years, although agricultural production in our country has increased year by year, the growth rate has lagged behind the needs of industrial construction and people's lives for agricultural products. Especially in the past two years, due to the serious impact of various natural disasters, agricultural production has not reached certain planned targets. Therefore, in the next few years, the task of increasing agricultural production, especially grain and cotton production, must be accomplished through significant efforts. In order to make the development of agriculture adapt to the needs of national industrial construction and people's lives, we must strive to complete and overfulfill the annual agricultural production plan, vigorously carry out the cooperative movement in rural areas, and gradually implement the technical reform of agriculture.

In order to promote the development of the cooperative movement and ensure the completion of agricultural production increase tasks, agricultural scientists in our country should conduct systematic scientific research in many areas. First, agricultural scientists must study the characteristics of agricultural production in the country and in various regions, seek ways to tap the potential of agricultural production, make full use of our country's superior climate, land, and animal and plant agricultural resources, overcome and mitigate natural disasters caused by various unfavorable natural conditions, and provide a scientific basis for governments at all levels to formulate agricultural plans. Second, it is necessary to study cultivation systems, cultivation methods, and livestock breeding methods suitable for different conditions in various regions, discover and cultivate improved varieties of crops and livestock, and study effective measures to prevent and control plant diseases, insect pests, and livestock diseases. Third, it is necessary to study the agricultural technical problems encountered in the development of the cooperative movement in order to fully exploit the superiority of agricultural production cooperatives and make agricultural production cooperatives more consolidated. Fourth, it is necessary to study special problems of great significance to the national economy in various regions (such as the tropical plant problems in South China, the soil and water conservation problems in the Yellow River Basin, etc.).

The vast number of working farmers in our country have accumulated extremely rich production experience in their long-term struggle against nature. Since liberation, farmers in various regions have more fully demonstrated their enthusiasm for improving agricultural technology. They have created models for increasing yields per unit area and are opening up many roads that modern agricultural science has not yet traveled through practice. The experience they have created is obtained under the natural conditions of the local climate and soil, so it is of particular importance. If agricultural scientists can scientifically summarize and improve these rich production experiences, find out the reasons for their increased production, and determine the conditions for promotion, they can not only solve the agricultural technical problems in increasing agricultural production at present, but also enrich and develop agricultural science. At the same time, we have the advanced scientific achievements of the Soviet Union to learn from, and creatively learning the advanced Soviet agricultural scientific theory can greatly improve the level of agricultural scientists in our country.

At present, our country has seven central government-administered regional agricultural science research institutes and three specialized research institutes, 32 provincial agricultural science research institutes and experimental farms, 34 higher agricultural colleges, and agricultural experiment stations distributed throughout the country, which have initially formed a network of agricultural scientific experiments and research. These institutions have thousands of scientific workers, including nearly one thousand scientists equivalent to associate professors or above, who have accumulated some experience and research results. At present, there are dozens of improved varieties of various crops promoted in production, which are the results of research and experiments by agricultural scientists in our country. These varieties, combined with suitable cultivation techniques, can generally increase production by 10 to 20 percent. The winter wheat variety "Bima No. 1," which was promoted on more than 7.5 million mu of land in 41 counties in Shaanxi Province, was one of the main reasons why Shaanxi Province achieved a bumper wheat harvest in 1954. After ideological reform and the study of Michurin's biological science, agricultural scientists in our country have greatly improved in terms of academic and ideological levels. On the basis of their original years of work, they have used the advanced agricultural scientific achievements of the Soviet Union and summarized mass experience to solve many important production problems. For example, the technical specifications for close planting under different conditions in our country have been determined. After adopting this cultivation technology, various regions can generally increase production by about 20 percent. Due to the successful trial production of "666" and its mass production, combined with the study of the living habits of pests, the locust plague, which has continuously caused disasters for more than two thousand years, has been basically controlled so that it does not cause disasters. Crystalline violet vaccine for hog cholera has also been successfully trial-produced and manufactured in large quantities, which has played a great role in the prevention and control of hog cholera. In recent years, agricultural research institutions in various regions have also trained a group of young scientific workers who are engaged in agricultural scientific work under the guidance of advanced Michurin's biological science. Some of them have already begun to achieve results. They are the new force in agricultural science and the hope for the development of agricultural science in our country.

We should correctly estimate the achievements that agricultural scientists have made; but at the same time, we must also see that the current state of agricultural science in our country is far from adapting to the tasks it should undertake. Agricultural scientific research lacks a unified plan and leadership; the strength of many experienced agricultural scientists concentrated in higher agricultural and forestry colleges in various regions has not yet been well organized and utilized. Therefore, on the one hand, many important production and theoretical problems are not being studied; on the other hand, many tasks are duplicated and wasted. Among agricultural scientific research personnel, the influence of bourgeois idealism is still not negligible. At the same time, there is also a tendency among some researchers to only value bits and pieces of experience and ignore agricultural theory, and there are shortcomings of formalism and dogmatism in learning advanced Soviet science. These have affected their scientific achievements. There are still many important departments in agricultural science in our country, such as genetics, microbiology, agricultural meteorology, agronomy, agricultural mechanics and other disciplines, which are still very weak at present. In order to make agricultural scientific research adapt to the development of the cooperative movement and the requirements of agricultural production increase tasks, these problems should be resolved in a timely manner.

To strengthen agricultural scientific research, first of all, it is required that agricultural departments at all levels strengthen their leadership over this work. In the past few years, agricultural departments at all levels have achieved some success in leading agricultural scientific work, but we still lack experience in how to organize this work more effectively according to the characteristics of scientific research work. It should be seen that in order to make agricultural science better serve agricultural production increase, on the one hand, scientific research personnel need to pay attention to linking their work with the actual production, and on the other hand, comrades who directly lead production work also need to be good at exerting the role of science in production. Agricultural departments at all levels should regularly study the status of agricultural scientific research work, put forward tasks to scientific research institutions and higher agricultural and forestry colleges, and create working conditions for them; at the same time, research results that are truly effective should be carefully promoted and researchers should be given due rewards.

Among agricultural scientists, it is necessary to promote the study of dialectical materialism, vigorously carry out academic criticism and discussion, overcome the influence of bourgeois idealism in agricultural scientific research work, so as to improve the academic level and make their research work better serve the promotion of the cooperative movement and the increase of agricultural production. The academic discussion meeting recently held by Beijing Agricultural University and the specialized societies of agricultural and forestry disciplines under the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies has proved that academic criticism and discussion are effective ways to promote the development of science, overcome shortcomings in research work, and improve the academic level of scientific research workers.

Strengthening the work of other scientific research departments related to agriculture is also an important condition for further carrying out agricultural scientific research. The relevant research institutes of the Biological and Earth Sciences Department of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the basic course teaching and research groups of higher agricultural and forestry colleges, and the relevant teaching and research groups of the biology and geography departments of universities should all study how to make their work directly or indirectly serve agricultural production.

Agricultural scientific research institutions are distributed throughout the country. Party committees in various regions should be good at using the strength of scientists and giving play to their role in formulating agricultural plans and leading agricultural production work, guide them to work harder for agricultural production increase, and should attract agricultural scientists and relevant cadres in various regions to launch discussions on agricultural scientific theory and practical issues in relevant meetings, publications, and newspapers, and greatly promote agricultural scientific work in our country under the common goal of serving agricultural production increase.

    加强农业科学研究工作
    几年来，我国农业生产虽然逐年增长，但增长的速度却落后于工业建设和人民生活对农业产品的需要，特别是在过去两年中，由于各种自然灾害的严重影响，农业生产没有达到原计划的某些指标。所以，在今后几年中，农业增产，特别是粮棉增产的任务还必须经过重大努力才能完成。为使农业的发展能够适应国家工业建设和人民生活的需要，必须争取完成和超额完成每年的农业生产计划，在农村中大力开展合作化运动，逐步实行农业的技术改革。
    为了促进合作化运动的发展和保证农业增产任务的完成，我国农业科学工作者应该在许多方面进行系统的科学研究工作。第一，农业科学工作者要研究全国和各个地区农业生产的特点，寻求挖掘农业生产潜力的途径，充分利用我国优越的气候、土地和动植物等农业资源，克服和减轻由于各种不利的自然条件所造成的自然灾害，为各级政府部门制订农业计划提供科学的根据。第二，要研究适合于各个地区不同条件的耕作制度、栽培方法和家畜繁殖饲养的方法，发现并培育农作物和家畜的优良品种，并研究防治植物病虫害和家畜疫病的有效措施。第三，要研究合作化运动发展中遇到的农业技术问题，以充分发挥农业生产合作社的优越性，使农业生产合作社更加巩固。第四，要研究各个地区在国民经济上有重大意义的特殊问题（如华南的热带植物问题，黄河流域的水土保持问题等）。
    我国广大的劳动农民在长期同大自然作斗争中积累了极为丰富的生产经验。解放以后，各地农民更充分地发挥了他们改进农业技术的积极性。他们为提高单位面积产量创造了范例，并正用实践开辟着许多近代农业科学尚未走过的道路。他们创造的经验是在当地的气候、土壤等自然条件下获得的，因此特别具有重要的意义。农业科学工作者如果能够对这些丰富的生产经验加以科学的总结和提高，找出其增产的原因，确定推广的条件，不但可以解决当前提高农业生产中的农业技术问题，而且也将丰富和发展农业科学。同时，我们有苏联先进的科学成就可以学习，而创造性地学习苏联先进的农业科学理论就能够大大提高我国农业科学工作者的水平。
    目前我国有七个中央直属的地区农业科学研究所和三个专业研究所，有三十二个省的农业科学研究所及试验场，三十四个高等农业院校，加上分布在各地的农业试验站等，已初步形成了一个农业科学的试验研究网。这些机构拥有数千科学工作人员，其中相当于副教授以上的科学家约近一千人，他们积累了一些经验和研究成果。目前有数十个在生产中推广的各种作物的优良品种，便是我国农业科学家研究试验的结果。这些品种结合适宜的栽培技术，一般都能增产百分之十到百分之二十。在陕西四十一县七百五十余万亩土地上推广的冬小麦品种“碧玛一号”，曾是一九五四年陕西省获得小麦丰收的主要原因之一。我国农业科学家经过思想改造和米丘林生物科学的学习，在学术水平和思想水平上已有很大的提高。他们在原来多年的工作基础上，运用苏联先进的农业科学成就和总结群众经验，解决了很多生产上的重要问题。例如确定了密植在我国不同条件下的技术规格，各地在采用这一栽培技术以后，一般都能增产百分之二十左右。由于“六六六”试制成功及其大量生产，并结合害虫生活习性的研究，已基本上控制了二千余年来不断造成灾害的蝗患，不使成灾。猪瘟结晶紫疫苗也已试制成功并大量制造，在猪瘟的防治上起了很大的作用。几年来各地农业研究机关还培养了一批年轻的科学工作者，他们在先进的米丘林生物科学的指导下从事农业科学工作，其中有一些已经开始获得成绩，他们是农业科学中的新生力量，是我们农业科学发展的希望。
    我们应当正确地估计农业科学工作者已经取得的成绩；但同时也要看到目前我国农业科学的状况还远不能适应它所应担负的任务。农业科学研究工作还缺乏统一的计划和领导；集中在各地高等农林院校中的许多有经验的农业科学家的力量也还没有很好地组织和运用起来。因此，一方面有许多重要的生产问题和理论问题没有人去研究；另一方面又有许多工作形成重复和浪费。在农业科学研究人员中，资产阶级唯心主义的影响仍然是不可忽视的。同时，在某些研究人员中也存在着只重视点滴经验、忽视农业理论的倾向，在学习苏联先进科学方面还有形式主义、教条主义的缺点。这些都影响到他们的科学成就。我国农业科学中还有许多重要的部门，如遗传学、微生物学、农业气象学、耕作学、农业机械学等学科，在目前还非常薄弱。为了使农业科学研究工作能够适应合作化运动的发展和农业增产任务的要求，这些问题都应当得到及时的解决。
    要加强农业科学研究工作，首先要求各级农业部门加强对这一工作的领导。几年来，各级农业部门在领导农业科学工作上已取得一些成绩，但是，究竟应该怎样根据科学研究工作的特点，更有效地组织这一工作，我们还缺乏经验。应该看到要使农业科学更好地为农业增产服务，一方面需要科学研究人员注意使自己的工作联系生产实际，另一方面，也需要直接领导生产工作的同志，善于发挥科学在生产中的作用。各级农业部门应当经常研究农业科学研究工作的状况，向科学研究机关和高等农林院校提出任务，为他们创造工作条件；同时，对确有成效的研究成果应认真地加以推广，并给予研究人员以应得的奖励。
    在农业科学工作者中，要提倡学习辩证唯物主义，大力开展学术上的批评和讨论，克服资产阶级唯心主义在农业科学研究工作中的影响，以提高学术水平，使自己的研究工作更好地为促进合作化运动和提高农业生产而服务。最近北京农业大学和中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会所属农林学科各专门学会召开的学术讨论会已经证明，学术上的批评和讨论是推动科学向前发展、克服研究工作中的缺点和提高科学研究工作人员学术水平的有效办法。
    加强其他同农业有关的科学研究部门的工作，也是进一步开展农业科学研究工作的重要条件。中国科学院生物学地学部有关的研究所，高等农林院校基础课程教研组和高等学校生物系、地理系有关教研组，都应该研究怎样使自己的工作直接或间接为农业生产服务的问题。
    农业科学研究机关分布在全国各地，各地党委在制订农业计划和领导农业生产工作中，应当善于使用科学家的力量，发挥他们的作用，引导他们更好地为农业增产而努力，应该吸引各地农业科学工作者和有关的干部，在有关的会议、刊物和报纸上展开农业科学理论和实际问题的讨论，在服务于农业增产的共同目的之下，把我国农业科学工作大大地推进一步。
