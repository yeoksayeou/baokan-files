The Growth of a Technical Supervision Station
Liang Zhuosen

In the second quarter of 1954, the small rolling mill section of the No. 1 Branch of Tianjin Steel Plant switched to using rimmed steel billets and installed a double-groove reversing stand. Due to the use of new raw materials and new equipment, the operational rules were not grasped for a while, and the product quality declined. Defective and waste products were continuously produced, and the task was not completed for three consecutive months. The workers were very anxious, and they carefully looked for the reasons for any slight defects and tried to correct them. However, the troublesome thing was that the rolling mill's production capacity was very large, and it could roll out several tons of steel per hour. After a red-hot steel bar at a temperature of 900 degrees was rolled out, by the time it cooled down for inspection and found to be substandard, many similar products had already been rolled out in succession. A large number of defective products were produced at once, sometimes even more than a ton.

"How can we find out where the problem lies as soon as defective products appear?" This became the most concerning and urgent problem to be solved by the workshop and the technical supervision department.

Inspector Zhang Yonghe had been thinking about this problem for many days, and finally he thought: "Only by watching diligently, watching the red-hot steel!" So every time he inspected about ten cold, black steel bars, he would ask the workers to swing a red-hot steel bar over for inspection. In this way, even if a problem was found, it would only be a matter of at most ten bars.

Nine hundred degrees! This is not a low temperature. Before you even get close to the steel bar, you can feel the heat scorching you, let alone using an iron hook to hook it up for inspection. In the hot summer, you would be covered in sweat in a few minutes. But in order to find the problem as soon as possible and reduce the number of waste products, Zhang Yonghe insisted on this inspection method and it worked. This inspection method was quickly promoted among the inspectors in all shifts of the technical supervision station.

Based on the timely records provided by the technical supervision station, the production department quickly corrected the product defects, and the quality improved significantly. Starting in July, the planned targets were exceeded month by month, and it rose month by month.

Because the technical supervision station was able to assist the production department in solving key problems in production, and truly played a role in supervision and inspection, the production department felt that this organization was very necessary and was very satisfied with their work. The deputy director of the workshop said: "Without the technical supervision station, our production would not be so normal." When the technical supervision station was first established two years ago, among all the supervisors and inspectors, except for the station director who had eight years of work experience, 60 percent of them had never even seen what a rolling mill looked like. At that time, quarreling and fighting with the workshop became commonplace. The supervisors believed that they were "nitpicking," and not opposing the workshop meant "not standing firm." Some employees in the workshop were not convinced and refused to accept the supervisors' opinions.

By the end of 1953, when the factory launched a quality inspection campaign, it examined the antagonistic thinking between production personnel and supervisors. The director of the technical supervision station and the deputy director of production signed a contract stipulating that the director of the supervision station would be responsible for educating supervisors with a bad attitude; the deputy director of production would be responsible for educating the workshop if it did not accept supervision. Since then, the technical supervision station has paid special attention to the way and method of work, being sincere, humble, and patient. More importantly, it has strengthened contact with the production department and assisted the workshop in solving many production problems. Moreover, they not only contacted them when there were problems with the products, but also when production was normal. For example, when the temperature of the heating furnace was suitable and the products produced met the standards, Supervisor Ding of Ding Shift would find the duty director and say: "The temperature is just right now, and there is not a single waste product. As long as you grasp it like this, the quality can reach 100 percent." The duty director said: "Let's do it this way!" As a result, the pass rate of that shift really reached 100 percent. The workers were very happy to receive such timely suggestions.

The reason why the technical supervision station can have a good relationship with the production department and assist the production department in solving problems is mainly that they can organize everyone and strengthen education. They often hold meetings to check the advantages and disadvantages of their work, conduct criticism and self-criticism, and emphasize the purpose of technical supervision work and the importance of good unity. They hold such meetings every week, and have been doing so for two years without interruption.

The technical supervision station also realized the importance of improving technical skills for ensuring and supervising production. In addition to a few people studying culture, 75 percent of the staff participated in the rolling mill class of the spare-time technical school. At the same time, they also organized the study of technical operating procedures and inspection standards. Supervisors also attended technical seminars in the workshop to listen, and consulted with veteran workers on problems at any time.

Willing to work, willing to learn, paying attention to unity, and having a clear goal, a young technical supervision station is gradually growing up in this way, playing an increasingly greater role in supervising and inspecting production.

    一个技术监督站的成长
    良濯森
    一九五四年第二季，天津钢厂一分厂小型轧钢工段改用了沸腾钢钢坯，并安装了双槽反围盘。由于使用新原料和新设备，一时还掌握不住操作上的规律，产品质量就下降了，次品废品不断产生，连续三个月没有完成任务。工人们很着急，稍微发生了一点缺陷便仔细找原因，想法纠正。但是，令人伤脑筋的是轧钢机的生产能力很大，一小时要轧出好多吨钢材，一根温度高达九百度的红热的钢条轧出来，等到冷却检验发现不合规格时，后面已经陆续又轧出了不少根同样的产品。次品一出一大堆，有时竟到一吨多。
    “怎样能使次品一出现就发现毛病在那里呢？”这成了车间和技术监督部门最关注和迫切需要解决的问题。
    检验员张永和多少天来一直想着这个问题，最后他想：“只有勤看，看红铁！”于是他每检验十根左右的冷黑铁，就叫工人给甩一根红铁过来检验。这样，即使发现毛病，最多不过是十根的事了。
    九百度！这不是个很低的温度。走不到钢条跟前，就会觉出热气烤人，更不用说用铁钩子把它钩起来检验了。夏天天气热，几分钟就会出满一身汗。但是为了尽快发现毛病，少出一些废品，张永和坚持了这一检验方法收到了效果。这个检验方法很快地就在技术监督站各班检验员中推广了。
    生产部门根据技术监督站及时提供的记录，很快地纠正了产品的毛病，质量显著地提高了。七月份起就按月超额完成了计划指标，并且逐月上升。
    由于技术监督站能够协助生产部门解决生产中的关键问题，真正起了监督、检查的作用，所以生产部门感到很需要这个机构，对他们的工作很满意，车间副主任说：“没有技术监督站，我们的生产就不会这样正常。”技术监督站在两年前刚成立时，在全体监督、检验人员中，除站长一人有八年工龄外，有百分之六十的人连轧钢机是什么样子都没见过，那时和车间吵嘴打架成了家常便饭。监督人员认为自己是“挑毛病”的，不和车间对立就是“没站稳立场”，车间有些职工不服气，也不肯接受监督人员的意见。
    到一九五三年年底，全厂开展质量检查运动时，检查了生产人员和监督人员对立的思想，技术监督站站长和生产副主任订了个合同，规定监督人员态度不好由监督站站长负责教育；车间不接受监督由生产副主任负责教育。从此，技术监督站特别注意了工作的方式方法，态度诚恳、虚心、耐心，更重要的是加强了与生产部门的联系，协助车间解决了不少生产上的问题。而且，不光产品出了毛病时联系，生产正常的时候也联系。如丁班监督员当烘钢炉温度适宜，生产的产品合乎标准时，就找到值班主任说：“现在温度正好，一根废品也没有，只要照这样掌握住，质量便能达到百分之百。”值班主任说：“咱们就这样干！”结果当班合格率果真达到百分之百。这样及时提意见，工人们都很高兴。
    技术监督站所以能和生产部门搞好关系，协助生产部门解决问题，主要是他们能把大家组织起来，加强教育。他们经常开会，检查工作中的优缺点，展开批评与自我批评，强调技术监督工作的目的性和搞好团结的重要性。这样的会，他们每星期都要开一次，而且两年来一直没有间断过。
    技术监督站更认识到提高技术水平对保证、监督生产的重要意义。全站除几个人学习文化外，百分之七十五的人都参加了业余技术学校的轧钢班学习，同时还组织了技术操作规程和检验标准的学习。车间各项技术研究会，监督人员也参加旁听，有问题并随时请教老工人。
    肯干、肯学、注意团结，目标明确，一个年轻的技术监督站就是这样地逐渐成长起来，一天比一天更大地发挥着监督和检查生产的作用。
