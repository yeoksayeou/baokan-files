After hearing the call to oppose the use of atomic weapons on the radio, the units performing duties scattered along the border had their leadership organs send cadres and propagandists to report to the units, or convened representative meetings for the representatives to return and convey the message, enthusiastically launching the signature campaign.

    From the 19th to the 21st, the headquarters, political department, and leadership organs of various services and arms of the PLA Northeast Military Region held signature rallies against the use of atomic weapons. Leaders of various units, combat heroes, and unit representatives spoke at the rallies, expressing the firm determination of the broad commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army to defend peace and oppose aggression, severely condemning the imperialist war-mongers for clamoring for war and attempting to use atomic weapons. They unanimously stated that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is not afraid of any atomic intimidation. Soldiers of a certain air defense unit held a signature gathering in their positions. Pilots of a certain air force unit signed in the airport on the morning of the 21st. Pilot Huang Jinyin said, "We love peace and oppose war, but we are always maintaining a high degree of vigilance. If the imperialists dare to launch a war and use atomic weapons, we will certainly eliminate them from the air!" Public security force commanders and fighters performing guard duties in various factories and districts in Shenyang also gathered and signed their names.

    A certain army unit that participated in the battle to liberate Yijiangshan Island held a grand signature rally on the 20th. In front of the signature table was a huge "Message to the People of the World," with large banners reading "Oppose the Use of Atomic Weapons." Commanders and combatants lined up and signed their names in front of the signature table in order. Platoon leader Shao Hongfa, a meritorious person, said: "We love the motherland and love peace. We must use the practical actions of liberating the coastal islands and Taiwan to oppose the war-mongers' use of atomic weapons and defend the safety and happiness of all mankind."

    Commanders and fighters of a certain fleet of the East China Navy who participated in the battle to liberate Yijiangshan Island solemnly held a signature rally on the Zhejiang front line on the 22nd. That morning, a red cloth with the words "Signature Rally Against the Use of Atomic Weapons" was hung in front of the bridge of a warship. The amplifier broadcasted "Victory March," and the sailors on the ship gathered around the artillery on the deck and universally signed their names. Zhu Guangrong, who had made meritorious service in the battle to liberate Yijiangshan Island, said: "We are soldiers who defend the motherland and defend peace. We oppose war, but we are not afraid of war or any war intimidation." Wang Sanzhang, a gunner, said: "The US imperialism's shouting about the use of atomic weapons only further illustrates that it is a paper tiger. If it really dares to launch an atomic war, we will definitely be with the peace-loving people of the world to resolutely eliminate it from the earth!" On the 20th, the sailors of a certain naval boat team that participated in the liberation of Yijiangshan Island also signed the "Message to the People of the World."

    十九日到二十一日三天中，中国人民解放军东北军区司令部、政治部和各兵种领导机关都分别举行了反对使用原子武器签名大会，各单位的首长、战斗英雄和部队代表在大会上讲话时都表明了人民解放军广大指战员保卫和平、反对侵略的坚强决心，严斥帝国主义战争贩子叫嚣战争、企图使用原子武器的罪恶阴谋；并一致表示中国人民解放军决不怕任何原子恫吓。某防空部队战士们在阵地上举行了签名集会。空军某部的飞行员们，二十一日早晨在机场上签了名。飞行员黄金印说：“我们热爱和平，反对战争，但我们时刻都在保持着高度的警惕，如果帝国主义敢于发动战争和使用原子武器，我们一定要从空中把他们消灭！”在沈阳市各工厂、各地区执行警卫任务的公安部队指战员们也分别集会签了名。
