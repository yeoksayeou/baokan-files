Korean Military Armistice Commission Secretaries' Meeting Confirms US Military Personnel Host Doesn't Want to Return to the US Side

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 11th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong, February 10th: Two Belgian soldiers crossed the military demarcation line and entered the area under the military control of the Korean and Chinese side. They arrived at a place near Xiyuting (transliteration) at approximately 7:30 AM on August 25, 1954. They stated that their names were Joseph Le Cles (military number S-56606) and Roger F. Host (military number S-43717), belonging to the Belgian Battalion in Korea. According to the investigation conducted by the Korean and Chinese side, these two soldiers are undoubtedly personnel from the United Nations Command.

General Li Sang-cho, Chief Commissioner of the Korean and Chinese side, pointed out at the Military Armistice Commission meeting on February 10th: "Now, Cles has expressed his willingness to return to the US side. Therefore, we will hand over Cles to the US side at 15:00 today (February 10th) in this jointly guarded area through our secretary. However, the other Belgian soldier, Host, has firmly stated that he is unwilling to return to the US side." At the meeting, Li Sang-cho suggested the Military Armistice Commission jointly request the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to send a mobile Neutral Nations Inspection Team to Kaesong, in the area under the military control of the Korean and Chinese side, to question Host. Li Sang-cho also said: "If Host expresses a desire to return to the US side during the questioning by the mobile Neutral Nations Inspection Team, we will also hand this person over to the US side."

This step by the Korean and Chinese side clearly demonstrates how consistently the Korean and Chinese side respects the personality and human rights of the US military personnel who cross the border into the Korean and Chinese side's area, guarantees their personal safety, and respects their wishes.

However, the US side, fearing that this fact would be known to everyone, has refused to allow the mobile Neutral Nations Inspection Team to participate in the questioning. The Korean and Chinese side once again suggested questioning Host at a meeting of the secretaries of both sides. The US side could not but agree to this suggestion.

The secretaries of both sides will meet at Panmunjom at 15:00 on February 11th for a joint interrogation of Host.

At the same time, the Belgian soldier Cles, who wished to return to the United Nations Command side, was handed over to the US side by the secretary of the Korean and Chinese side at 15:00 on February 10th in the jointly guarded area of Panmunjom.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 13th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong: The meeting of the secretaries of both sides of the Military Armistice Commission was held on February 11th, confirming that US military personnel Roger F. Host (military number S-43717) indeed did not want to return to the US side.

Colonel Lu Yin-hee, Secretary of the Korean and Chinese side, asked Host a series of questions at the meeting. Colonel Lu Yin-hee asked him what the purpose was of crossing the military demarcation line and entering the area under the military control of the Korean and Chinese side. Host replied: "The reason I came to North Korea is because I am unwilling to live in the capitalist country of Belgium, so I came to a people's country."

When asked, "What did you tell the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers side that you hoped for?" He said, "I expressed my wish to go to the great country - the People's Republic of China."

When asked, "Did the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers side ever advise you to return to the United Nations Command side?" Host replied, "Although they repeatedly advised me to return to the United Nations Command side, I expressed my firm determination not to return to the US side every time."

Colonel Robarge, Secretary of the US side, also asked some questions. Host consistently expressed his firm will not to return to the United Nations Command side.

After both sides finished questioning, the Secretary of the Korean and Chinese side pointed out:
	"The secretaries of both sides have already asked Host himself here whether he is willing to return to the US side. As a result, the secretaries of both sides confirmed that Roger F. Host, the US personnel who crossed the military demarcation line and entered our military control area, is unwilling to return to the US side. This confirmed fact will remain on the records of both sides."

Finally, Colonel Lu Yin-hee, Secretary of the Korean and Chinese side, solemnly announced:
	"US military personnel Roger F. Host, who entered our military control area, as confirmed by the secretaries of both sides, firmly stated that he is unwilling to return to the US side, although we have repeatedly advised him to return to the US side; therefore, we cannot hand him over to the US side.
	Our handling of this incident is in full compliance with the armistice agreement and humanitarianism."

Our secretary added: "Our side will do everything possible to assist Roger F. Host, the US military personnel who is unwilling to return to the US side, to live a happy life in the future."

    朝鲜军事停战委员会双方秘书长会议
    证实美方军事人员贺斯特不愿再回美方
    【新华社平壤十一日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社开城十日讯：两名比利时士兵越过军事分界线进入受朝中方面军事控制的地区，在一九五四年八月二十五日上午七时三十分左右到达西榆亭（译音）附近的一个地方。他们说他们名叫约瑟夫·勒·克莱斯（军籍号码S—五六六○六）和罗歇·弗·贺斯特（军籍号码S—四三七一七），属于在朝鲜的比利时营。根据朝中方面进行的调查，这两个士兵无疑是联合国军司令部方面的人员。
    朝中方面的首席委员李相朝中将二月十日在军事停战委员会会议上指出：“现在克莱斯表示愿意回到美方。因此我们将在今天（二月十日）十五时在这个共同守卫的地区通过我方的秘书长把克莱斯交给美方。但是另一个比利时士兵贺斯特坚决表示不愿回美方。”李相朝中将在会上建议军事停战委员会双方共同要求中立国监察委员会派一个机动的中立国视察小组到受朝中方面军事控制的地区的开城讯问贺斯特。李相朝中将还说：“如果贺斯特在机动的中立国视察小组讯问的过程中表示了要回到美方去的愿望，我方也将把这个人交给美方。”
    朝中方面的这一步骤清楚地证明了在对待越界进入朝中方面地区的美方军事人员上，朝中方面是如何始终一贯地尊重他们的人格和人权，保障他们的人身安全，并尊重他们的愿望。
    但是，美方由于害怕这个事实被大家知道，已经拒绝让机动的中立国视察小组参加讯问。朝中方面再一次建议在一次双方秘书长会议上讯问贺斯特。美方不能不同意这个建议。
    为了共同对贺斯特进行讯问，双方的秘书长将在二月十一日十五时在板门店开会。
    同时，愿回到联合国军司令部方面去的比利时士兵克莱斯已经由朝中方面的秘书长在二月十日十五时在板门店共同守卫的地区交给了美方。
    【新华社平壤十三日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：军事停战委员会双方秘书长会议在二月十一日举行，证实了美方军事人员罗歇·弗·贺斯特（军号S—四三七一七）确实不愿回到美方去。
    朝中方面秘书长卢寅熙大校在会上向贺斯特提出了一系列的问题。卢寅熙大校问到他越过军事分界线进入朝中方面军事控制地区的目的何在，贺斯特回答说：“我来到北朝鲜的原因是由于我不愿意在资本主义国家比利时生活，所以我来到一个人民的国家”。
    当问他：“你告诉朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面你所希望的是什么？”他说：“我表示了我想到伟大的国家——中华人民共和国去的愿望。”
    当问他：“朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军方面曾经劝你回到联合国军司令部方面去吗？”贺斯特回答说：“虽然他们曾一再劝我回到联合国军司令部方面去，但是我每一次都表示了我不愿回到美方去的坚定决心。”
    美方秘书长罗巴兹上校也提出了一些问题，贺斯特始终表示了他不愿意回到联合国军司令部方面去的坚定意志。
    当双方讯问完毕后，朝中方面秘书长指出：
  “双方秘书长已经在这里问过贺斯特本人他是否愿意回到美方去的问题。结果，双方秘书长证实，越过军事分界线进入我方军事控制地区的美方人员罗歇·弗·贺斯特，不愿意回到美方去。这个获得了证实的事实将留在双方的记录上。”
    最后，朝中方面秘书长卢寅熙大校郑重宣布：
  “进入我方军事控制地区的美方军事人员罗歇·弗·贺斯特，如双方秘书长所证实，坚决表示不愿意回到美方去，虽然我方曾一再劝他回到美方去；因此，我方不能把他移交给美方。
    我们对这个事件的处理是完全符合停战协定和人道主义的。”
    我方秘书长又说：“我方将尽一切可能来协助这个不愿意回到美方去的美方军事人员罗歇·弗·贺斯特在将来过幸福生活。”
