Xinhua News Agency, February 17th: According to Indian news sources, the talks between Indian Prime Minister Nehru and Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser in Cairo concluded on the 16th. Nehru arrived in Cairo on the 15th after attending the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in London.

A joint communique issued after the Nehru-Nasser talks stated that their two days of discussions "demonstrated a consensus of views on major international events." The communique stated, "The two Prime Ministers believe that every effort must be made to prevent war and create an atmosphere of peace. International disputes should be resolved peacefully through negotiation. Military alliances and power blocs that increase tension and the arms race will not contribute to the security of a country." The communique concluded: "The two Prime Ministers look forward to meeting again in Delhi soon to continue their friendly contacts, and they also look forward to meeting at the Asian-African Conference in Indonesia, and believe that the Asian-African Conference will help promote world peace and happiness."

    两国总理认为必须努力阻止战争为和平创造气氛
    【新华社十七日讯】据印度新闻处消息：印度总理尼赫鲁和埃及总理纳赛尔在开罗举行的会谈已经在十六日结束。尼赫鲁是在参加在伦敦举行的英联邦总理会议后于十五日到达开罗的。
    尼赫鲁和纳赛尔会谈后发表联合公报说，他们两天的会谈“说明在重大国际事件上意见是一致的”。公报说，“两国总理认为，必须作一切努力来阻止战争并且为和平创造气氛。国际纠纷应该通过谈判来和平解决。增加紧张局势和军备竞赛的军事同盟和实力上的结合，对一个国家的安全不会有什么帮助。”公报最后说：“两国总理期望早日在德里会晤，继续他们的友好接触，他们也期望在印度尼西亚的亚非会议上会晤，并且相信亚非会议将有助于促进世界和平和幸福。”
