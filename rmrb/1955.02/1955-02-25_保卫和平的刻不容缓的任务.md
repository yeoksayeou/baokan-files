    The Urgent Task of Defending Peace

    The Subcommittee of the United Nations Disarmament Commission is scheduled to meet in London on February 25. According to the resolution of the Ninth United Nations General Assembly, the task of the Disarmament Commission is to make another effort to seek a generally acceptable agreement on the issues of disarmament, complete prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. Therefore, peace-loving people of all countries attach great importance to and closely watch the work of the Disarmament Commission that is about to begin in London.

    Disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons are fundamental issues for ensuring world peace and are urgent tasks. On this issue, since the establishment of the United Nations, there has always been a sharp struggle between two lines. On the one hand, the Soviet Union has made unremitting efforts to achieve the lofty task of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in order to consolidate world peace and international security. On the other hand, the U.S. aggressive bloc has done everything possible to obstruct progress in this area in order to prepare for a new war, so that they can expand armaments without restriction and pursue the shameful policy of atomic blackmail. Now, as the London meeting is about to be held, these two different approaches are particularly distinct.

    The U.S.'s so-called policy of strength of expanding armaments and preparing for war has played a greater role in endangering peace due to the consistent support of the British authorities. The fact that universal disarmament has not been achieved in nine years and atomic weapons have not been prohibited is entirely the responsibility of the international aggressive forces headed by the U.S. aggressive bloc.

    On February 18, the Soviet government issued a statement proposing new suggestions on the issue of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. The Soviet government suggested that all countries undertake the following obligations: 1. Completely destroy the atomic and hydrogen weapons currently stored in each country, so that atomic materials can only be used for peaceful purposes. 2. Not increase the number of their armed forces and armaments beyond the level of January 1, 1955, nor increase their appropriations for military affairs beyond the level of the 1955 budget appropriations. The Soviet government advocates the establishment of appropriate international supervision in this regard to supervise compliance with the above decisions. At the same time, the Soviet government also advocates that the United Nations must convene a world conference in 1955 to discuss the issue of universal disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons.

    Anyone can see that the Soviet Union's suggestions and proposals once again point out the path to save the people of all countries from the threat of atomic war, and also point out the path to end the arms race in order to reduce the burden of military expenditure on the people of all countries. In the current situation where the United States and some of its allies are openly preparing for atomic war, the Soviet government's proposal is of particularly urgent importance. The realization of this proposal will eliminate the crisis of a new war and greatly ease international tensions. This is another major effort by the Soviet government to strive for peace. It fully conforms to the wishes of the peace-loving people of all countries and has therefore received widespread welcome and enthusiastic support from fair-minded public opinion around the world.

    The Soviet Union's proposals have also aroused significant repercussions in Western countries. Diplomats and observers at the United Nations believe that the Soviet Union's proposals are "a step forward towards universal disarmament"; the French bourgeois newspaper "Le Monde" also acknowledged that the Soviet Union's proposals are what the whole world desires. Nevertheless, the U.S. aggressive bloc has demonstrated a frantic war-mongering intention. Fearing the impact of the Soviet proposals, it immediately used various methods to express opposition to the Soviet proposals in order to create another deadlock on the disarmament issue.

    The United States openly expressed its opposition to the Soviet Union's proposal that the number of armed forces and armaments should not exceed the level of January 1, 1955, on the grounds that this would hinder its rearmament of Germany. Lodge, the U.S. representative who will attend the London Disarmament Conference, openly stated that the United States "absolutely cannot give up" its "right" to use atomic and hydrogen weapons, and said that he has "confidence in the military strength" of the United States. At the same time, it is also not accidental that at the time when this disarmament conference is about to be held, on the one hand, the Soviet Union is proposing to destroy the existing atomic and hydrogen weapons of all countries; on the other hand, the British Conservative government has issued a "white paper" publicly announcing that the United Kingdom will "develop and manufacture thermonuclear weapons." It is particularly noteworthy that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries, manipulated by the U.S.-British bloc, announced that they would conduct atomic war exercises in Norway and Denmark at the end of February. These facts show that the U.S. government and its British partners are interested not in eliminating the threat of atomic war, but in provoking an atomic arms race and actively preparing for atomic war.

    In order to conceal their plan to expand armaments and prepare for atomic war, which is hostile to the peace-loving people of all countries, the U.S. and British propaganda machines constantly spread various distortions to slander the Soviet Union's proposals. They nonsensically said that the Soviet Union's proposals were to make "Russia have a great advantage in conventional weapons, and deprive the West of its advantage in atomic weapons." This shameless statement completely exposes that they never plan for peace, and are only focused on pursuing war and preparing for war. In fact, in the years since the end of World War II, it is the United States and some of its allies that have been making efforts to expand armaments, not the Soviet Union. In recent years, the United States has used the vast majority of its national expenditure for military affairs, with military expenditures accounting for more than 70 percent of the national budget, while the Soviet Union has devoted itself to peaceful construction, with military expenditures accounting for only about 20 percent of national expenditure each year. This alone is enough to show who is trying to create military superiority and prepare for war.

    The Soviet Union has a strong national defense force and possesses atomic and hydrogen weapons, but it does not intend to invade anyone. On the contrary, it has consistently demanded disarmament and the destruction of atomic and hydrogen weapons at home and abroad, and advocates and strives for peaceful coexistence and friendly cooperation among all countries in the world. It is also prepared to provide relevant international conferences with knowledge and experience in the peaceful use of atomic energy. It has also formally proposed to provide some countries with assistance in the peaceful use of atomic energy. All this vividly embodies the essence of the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy, which is the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems, which is that the people of all countries can live a peaceful and tranquil life without threat.

    The U.S. aggressive bloc does the opposite of the Soviet Union. At the Ninth United Nations General Assembly, although the United States, Britain, and France jointly proposed a joint proposal with the Soviet Union, and the General Assembly passed a resolution instructing the Disarmament Commission to make efforts to seek solutions to the issues of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction, they disregarded all this and openly adopted measures to expand armaments and prepare for atomic war. The Paris Agreements they signed directly violated the purpose of the above-mentioned resolution of the United Nations, and it will inevitably intensify the arms race, including the race to produce atomic weapons. Because, as everyone knows, the Paris Agreements allow the German revanchists' army to possess atomic weapons. In Asia, the U.S., British, French, and other colonial countries established the Southeast Asia military bloc, and impatiently convened the Bangkok Conference to plan the establishment of an aggressive army in order to "equip" this group "with teeth." The United States even signed a war treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group, invaded China's territory of Taiwan and Penghu, and armed intervention in China's internal affairs. Recently, it has indicated that it will further invade China's coastal islands. In the Middle East, the United States and Britain, ignoring the opposition of Arab countries, attempted to undermine the unity of Arab countries through the military treaty between Turkey and Iraq in order to control them separately and force them to participate in the Middle East military bloc that the U.S. and Britain are planning. This series of aggressive war actions by the U.S. aggressive bloc is to establish a "defense system" and "island chain" surrounding the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries to prepare for a war aimed at restoring the rule of imperialism in the world.

    The actions of the U.S. madmen wielding atomic weapons have increased the danger of a new war, and have increased the danger of atomic war. But the atomic war threats and intimidations of the United States will absolutely not scare the people of peace-loving countries. The countries of the socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, have sufficient strength to defend their own security and give a devastating counterattack to reckless aggressors. Bulganin, the leader of the Soviet government, said as early as July 22 last year: "If anyone dares to use atomic weapons, the Soviet Union will return ten for one." Chairman Mao Zedong also said on the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance: "We can all see that with the great cooperation between our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, all imperialist aggression plans cannot be crushed. They must be completely crushed. As long as imperialism launches a war of aggression, we and the people of the world must wipe them off the face of the earth!" Now is the time for the U.S. aggressive bloc and its followers to wake up.

    The peace-loving people of the world are vigilant, and they will not allow the U.S. aggressive bloc to launch an atomic war at will. The World Peace Council's call for the destruction of all stored atomic weapons and the immediate cessation of the manufacture of atomic weapons has been enthusiastically supported by the peace-loving people of all countries. The signature campaign against atomic weapons has been widely launched all over the world. The Soviet Union's proposal on disarmament and the destruction of atomic and hydrogen weapons is a huge support for the wishes of the peace-loving people of the world, and an encouragement to this wish. The peace-loving people of all countries will fight even harder to oppose the U.S. aggressive bloc's plan to prepare for atomic war.

    Disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons are related to the interests of all mankind, and the Chinese people fully support the Soviet Union's proposal. The Soviet Union's proposal that the meeting to discuss disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons should be attended by both member and non-member states of the United Nations is completely reasonable and necessary. If the U.S.-British bloc intends to exclude Asian powers, especially the People's Republic of China, from participating in such issues, then they are deliberately unwilling to achieve any success at the disarmament conference. They deliberately want to turn the disarmament conference into another place for endless quarrels, in order to aggravate the tense situation.

    This problem is reminiscent of the unreasonable decision of the United Nations Advisory Committee on the preparation of the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy. Due to the manipulation of the United States, this advisory committee actually refused to consider the Soviet Union's proposal to invite the People's Republic of China to participate in this international conference. This made the Chinese people very indignant. This once again proves how irresponsible, lacking in ability and prestige the United Nations is in adhering to the United Nations Charter and seeking peace and cooperation, by allowing itself to be manipulated by the United States.

      Disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the promotion of the peaceful use of atomic energy must be discussed by a world conference including all countries in the world. All countries that truly care about peace have a responsibility to promote the realization of the Soviet Union's proposal on disarmament, the prohibition of atomic weapons, and the convening of a world disarmament conference. This task is urgent, and the peace-loving people and countries of the world should unite and work together for this noble task!

### 保卫和平的刻不容缓的任务

    保卫和平的刻不容缓的任务
    联合国裁军委员会小组委员会定于二月二十五日在伦敦举行会议。根据第九届联合国大会的决议，裁军委员会的任务是再一次进行努力，以便就裁减军备、完全禁止原子武器和氢武器以及其他大规模毁灭性武器的问题求得一个大家都可以接受的协议。因此，各国爱好和平人民都十分重视并密切地注意着裁军委员会在伦敦开始的工作。
    裁减军备和禁止原子武器是保障世界和平的根本问题，是刻不容缓的任务。在这个问题上，自联合国成立以来，始终存在着两条路线的尖锐斗争。一方面苏联为了巩固世界和平和国际安全，不懈地为实现裁减军备和禁止原子武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器的崇高任务而努力；另一方面美国侵略集团为了准备新战争，使尽一切方法阻挠这方面的进展，以便他们得以无限制地扩张军备，并推行可耻的原子讹诈政策。现在，在伦敦会议即将举行的时候，这两种不同的做法表现得格外分明。
    美国这种扩军备战的所谓实力政策，由于得到了英国当政者的一贯支持，就发生了更大的危害和平的作用。九年来普遍裁减军备不能实现，原子武器不能禁止，完全是以美国侵略集团为首的国际侵略势力的责任。
    二月十八日，苏联政府发表声明，就裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题提出了新的建议。苏联政府建议各国担承下面的义务：一、完全销毁各国现在储存的原子武器和氢武器，使原子原料只能被用于和平用途。二、不得使自己的武装部队和军备的数量增加到超过一九五五年一月一日的水平，也不得使自己的用于军事方面的拨款增加到超过一九五五年度预算拨款的水平。苏联政府主张在这方面建立适当的国际监督，来监督遵守上述的决定。同时，苏联政府还主张必须由联合国在一九五五年召开一次讨论普遍裁减军备和禁止原子武器问题的世界会议。
    任何人都能看得出，苏联的这些建议和主张再
  一次指出了使各国人民免受原子战争威胁的道路，同时也指出了结束军备竞赛以便减轻各国人民军费负担的道路。在目前美国和它的一些盟国公开准备原子战争的情况下，苏联政府的建议尤其有着迫切的重要意义。这个建议的实现将可以消除新战争的危机，并大大缓和国际紧张局势。这是苏联政府争取和平的又一重大努力。它完全符合各国爱好和平人民的愿望，因而受到全世界公正舆论的广泛欢迎和热烈支持。
    在西方国家中，苏联的建议也引起了重大的反响。联合国的外交家和观察家认为苏联的建议是
  “朝普遍裁军方面前进的一步”；法国资产阶级报纸“世界报”也承认苏联的建议是全世界所渴望的。尽管如此，美国侵略集团却表现了疯狂的好战意图。它害怕苏联建议所发生的影响，迫不及待地马上用各种方法表示反对苏联的建议，以便造成裁军问题上的又一个僵局。
    美国公然表示反对苏联主张武装部队和军备数量不得超过一九五五年一月一日的水平的建议，理由是这样将妨碍它重新武装德国。将要出席伦敦裁军会议的美国代表洛奇公然表示，美国“绝对不能放弃”使用原子武器和氢武器的“权利”，并且说他对于美国的“军事力量具有信心”。同时，也并不是偶然的，在这次裁军会议将要举行时，一方面是苏联提出销毁各国现存的原子武器和氢武器；另一方面英国保守党政府却发表一个“白皮书”，公开宣布英国要“发展和制造热核子武器”。特别令人注意的是，受美英集团操纵的北大西洋集团国家宣布定于二月底在挪威和丹麦进行原子战争演习。这些事实表明，美国政府和它的英国伙伴所感觉兴趣的不是消除原子战争的威胁，而是挑起原子武器竞赛，积极准备原子战争。
    为了掩饰它们以各国爱好和平人民为敌的扩张军备和准备原子战争的计划，美国和英国的宣传机器不断地散布各种歪曲说法，来诬蔑苏联的建议。它们胡说什么苏联的建议是要使“俄国在常规武器方面占很大的优势，而且，剥夺了西方在原子武器方面的优势”。这种无耻的说法完全暴露他们从来不为和平打算，一心只是要追求战争和准备战争。事实上，在第二次世界大战结束以来的年代中，竭力进行军备扩张的是美国和它的一些盟国，而不是苏联。最近几年来，美国把绝大部分国家开支用在军事方面，军事费用占了国家预算的百分之七十以上，而苏联则全力从事和平建设，军事费用历年只占国家开支的百分之二十左右。只这一点就足以说明，力图造成军事优势，准备战争的究竟是谁。
    苏联拥有强大的国防力量，拥有原子武器和氢武器，但是它并不准备侵犯谁，相反的它一贯地在联合国内外要求裁减军备和销毁原子武器和氢武器，主张并努力谋求世界各国和平共处，友好合作。它还准备向有关的国际会议提供和平利用原子能的知识和经验。它并已正式建议给若干国家以有关和平利用原子能的帮助。这一切生动地体现了苏联和平外交政策的实质，这就是不同社会制度国家的和平共处，这就是各国人民能够不受威胁地过和平安宁的生活。
    美国侵略集团和苏联的做法相反。在九届联合国大会上，美国、英国和法国虽然曾和苏联提出了联合提案，并由大会通过决议，责成裁军委员会进行努力，寻求对于裁减军备和禁止原子武器及其他大规模毁灭性武器问题的解决办法，但是它们却不顾这一切，公开地采取了扩军备战和准备原子战争的措施。它们所签订的巴黎协定，就直接违反了联合国上述决议的目的，它将不可避免地使军备竞赛包括生产原子武器方面的竞赛加紧起来。因为，人所共知，巴黎协定容许德国复仇主义者的军队拥有原子武器。在亚洲，美、英、法等殖民国家建立了东南亚军事集团，并迫不及待地召开曼谷会议，策划建立侵略军队，以便为这个集团“装上牙齿”。美国更和蒋介石卖国集团签订了战争条约，侵占了中国的领土台湾和澎湖，武装干涉中国内政。最近更表示要进一步侵占中国的沿海岛屿。在中东，美国和英国不顾阿拉伯国家的反对，企图通过土耳其和伊拉克的军事条约，来破坏阿拉伯国家的团结，以便分别控制它们，并迫使它们参加美英正在策划的中东军事集团。美国侵略集团的这一系列的侵略战争行为，是为了要建立起包围苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的“防御体系”和“岛屿锁链”，来准备发动一场目的在于恢复帝国主义在全世界的统治的战争。
    挥舞着原子武器的美国狂人们的行为，已使新战争的危险正在增加，已使原子战争的危险正在增加。　　　　但是，美国的原子战争的威胁和恫吓，绝对吓不倒爱好和平国家的人民。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的国家有足够的力量来保卫自己的安全，给轻举妄动的侵略者以毁灭性的反击。苏联政府领袖布尔加宁早在去年七月二十二日，就曾说过：“谁如果敢于使用原子武器，苏联要一个还十个。”毛泽东主席在中苏友好同盟互助条约签订五周年的时候也说：“我们大家可以看到，在我们中苏两国的伟大合作下，一切帝国主义的侵略计划，没有不能被粉碎的。它们一定要被彻底粉碎。只要帝国主义发动侵略战争，我们和全世界人民就一定要将它们从地球上消灭干净！”现在应该是美国侵略集团和它们的追随者清醒的时候了。
    全世界爱好和平的人民都在警惕着，他们不容许美国侵略集团为所欲为地发动原子战争。世界和平理事会发出的要求销毁储存的全部原子武器，并且立即停止制造原子武器的号召，已得到各国爱好和平人民的热烈拥护。全世界各地都已广泛地展开了反对原子武器的签名运动。苏联关于裁减军备和销毁原子武器和氢武器的建议，是对全世界爱好和平人民的愿望的巨大支持，也是对这种愿望的鼓舞。各国爱好和平人民将以再接再厉的斗争，来反对美国侵略集团准备原子战争的计划。
    裁减军备和禁止原子武器关系着全人类的利益，中国人民完全支持苏联的建议。苏联主张讨论裁军和禁止原子武器问题的会议应该有联合国会员国与非会员国参加，这是完全合理的，必要的。美英集团如果有意在这样的问题上排斥亚洲大国，特别是中华人民共和国参加，那么，它们就是存心不愿裁军会议有所成就。它们就是故意想把裁军会议变成又一次吵闹不休，借以加剧紧张局势的地方。
    这个问题令人想起筹备和平利用原子能国际会议的联合国谘询委员会的无理决定。由于美国的操纵，这个谘询委员会竟拒绝考虑苏联关于邀请中华人民共和国参加这个国际会议的建议。这使中国人民非常愤慨。这又一次证明联合国听任自己受美国的操纵，使它自己在奉行联合国宪章、谋求和平和合作的事业上，表现得是怎样的不负责任，怎样的缺乏能力和威信。
      裁减军备、禁止原子武器和促进原子能的和平利用，必须有一个包括全世界一切国家的世界会议来讨论。一切真正关心和平的国家，都有责任促使苏联关于裁减军备、禁止原子武器和召开世界裁军会议的建议得到实现。这个任务是刻不容缓的，全世界爱好和平的人民和国家应当团结起来，为这个崇高的任务而共同努力！
