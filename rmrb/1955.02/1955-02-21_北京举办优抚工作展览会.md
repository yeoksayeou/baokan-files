The Beijing Civil Affairs Bureau held an exhibition on preferential treatment work in Zhongshan Park on the 16th.

The exhibition shows the great achievements made by Beijing in organizing the families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers to engage in production in recent years. There are now 134 military dependents' production groups in various districts of the city, with more than 1,400 martyrs' and military dependents participating in production. Some production groups have now developed into factories. The Xuanwu District Military Dependents' Wood Factory initially started as a production group of only ten military dependents processing firewood, but has now developed into a semi-mechanized wood factory with more than 120 factory buildings and 290 employees. Zhang Youliang, a military dependent, didn't have any skills when he first joined production, but now he can skillfully master the technology of repairing sewing machines, with a monthly income of more than 700,000 yuan. Some military dependents, after participating in production, no longer need government subsidies. The exhibition also includes pictures of political and cultural study classes held by the Beijing Municipal People's Government to cultivate employment opportunities for the families of martyrs and military dependents. Last year, the Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau and various districts introduced more than 1,600 families of martyrs and military dependents to participate in production and employment.

Many pictures vividly reflect the love and respect of the people of the capital for the families of martyrs, military dependents, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The photos introduce the large-scale activities of supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military dependents that took place in the capital around the Spring Festival of 1954. The attached Girls' Middle School of Beijing Normal University is a model unit in Beijing for supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to military dependents. They often write letters to express their concern for the soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and have established a deep friendship with the soldiers. The exhibition also introduced the hard work and active participation of many model martyrs' families, military dependents, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers in various national endeavors. More than 220 families of martyrs and military dependents in the city have been elected as people's representatives of the city, districts, and townships. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 北京举办优抚工作展览会

    北京举办优抚工作展览会
    北京市民政局十六日在中山公园举办优抚工作展览会。
    展览会表明了北京市几年来组织革命烈士家属、革命军人家属生产等有了很大成绩。现在城内各区已有一百三十四个军属生产小组，参加生产的烈属、军属有一千四百多人。有一些生产小组现在已发展成了工厂。宣武区军属木工厂初成立时是一个只有十名军属加工劈柴的生产小组，现在已发展成为拥有一百二十多间厂房、二百九十多名职工的半机械化的木工厂了。军属张有亮刚参加生产时什么技术也不会，现在已能熟练地掌握修理缝纫机的技术，每月收入七十多万元。有一些军属参加生产后，已不需要政府补助。展览会还有北京市人民政府为培养烈属、军属就业条件而举办的政治、文化学习班的图片。去年市人民政府民政局和各区介绍了一千六百多个烈属、军属参加生产和就业。
    许多图片生动地反映了首都人民对烈属、军属和中国人民解放军的热爱和尊敬。照片介绍了一九五四年春节前后首都展开大规模拥军优属活动的情况。北京师范大学附属女子中学是北京市拥军优属模范单位，她们经常写信慰问中国人民解放军战士，和战士们建立了深厚的友谊。展览会还介绍了许多模范烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人努力劳动和积极参加国家各项工作的情景。全市有二百二十多个烈属、军属被选为市、区、乡的人民代表。（新华社）
