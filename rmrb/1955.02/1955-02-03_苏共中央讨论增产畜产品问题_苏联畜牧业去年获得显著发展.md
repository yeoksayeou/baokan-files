    The CPSU Central Committee Discusses the Issue of Increasing Livestock Products
    Significant Development in Soviet Animal Husbandry Last Year
   [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 2nd] TASS Moscow, February 1st: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held a plenary session from January 25th to 31st.
    The plenary session listened to and discussed the report made by N.S. Khrushchev on increasing the production of livestock products and adopted a corresponding resolution.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 2nd] In 1954, Soviet agricultural workers implemented the various measures of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government on developing animal husbandry, and achieved remarkable results.
    Over the past year, the number of livestock in the Soviet Union has greatly increased. As of October 1, 1954, the total number of cattle in the country had increased from 63 million head in the same period of 1953 to 64.9 million head, pigs increased to 51 million, and sheep increased to 117.75 million. The number of pigs and sheep has exceeded the highest historical level in 1928, and the number of cattle is also close to the 1928 level. Due to the increase in the number of livestock and the increase in the productivity of livestock products, as of November 1 last year, the state purchased and acquired 233,000 tons more meat than in the same period in 1953, 669,000 tons more milk, and the purchase and acquisition of wool also increased.
    In Soviet animal husbandry, dairy cow breeding, which is of great significance to the national economy but the most backward, developed particularly rapidly in 1954. From October 1, 1953, to October 1, 1954, the average number of dairy cows in collective farms and state farms under the Soviet state farm department increased by 12 percent. If we add the dairy cows privately raised by Soviet laborers, the total number of dairy cows in the Soviet Union last year reached 27.5 million, which is close to the level of 1940 before the Great Patriotic War. At the same time, the product productivity of dairy cows in collective farms increased by an average of 7 percent. In collective farms in Chelyabinsk, Lysen, Chernovtsi and other states, the milk production per dairy cow increased by 32 to 48 percent last year.
    Soviet agricultural workers extensively launched a socialist competition to develop animal husbandry last year, striving to reach the national standard that can guarantee full satisfaction of residents' needs for livestock products. This standard stipulates that every 100 hectares (each hectare is equal to 15 mu) of cultivated land should produce 3 tons of pork throughout the year, every 100 hectares of usable cultivated land, grassland, and pasture should have 10 dairy cows, and produce 25 to 26 tons of milk throughout the year. In the competition, the number of dairy cows in Kaliningrad Oblast increased by 30 percent last year. Many collective farms in the Pravdinsk-Guryev and Slavsk districts of this oblast produced 24 to 29 tons of milk per 100 hectares of agricultural land throughout the year. Many collective farms and state farms in Belarus and Ukraine, as well as the Urals, North Caucasus, and Volga River basin, produced an average of more than 3 to 4 tons of pork per 100 hectares of cultivated land.

    苏共中央讨论增产畜产品问题
    苏联畜牧业去年获得显著发展
   【新华社二日讯】塔斯社莫斯科一日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会在一月二十五日到三十一日举行了全体会议。
    全体会议听取和讨论了尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫所作的关于增加畜产品生产的报告，并且通过了相应的决议。
    【新华社莫斯科二日电】一九五四年，苏联农业劳动者执行了苏联共产党和苏联政府关于发展畜牧业的各项措施，获得了显著的成绩。
    一年来，苏联的牲畜头数已经有了很大的增加。到一九五四年十月一日，全国牛的总数已经由一九五三年同期的六千三百万头增加到六千四百九十万头，猪增加到了五千一百万只，羊增加到了一亿一千七百五十万只。猪羊的数目已经超过了一九二八年历史上最高的水平，牛的数目也已经接近一九二八年水平。由于牲畜头数的增加和畜产品生产率的提高，截至去年十一月一日为止，国家征购和收购的肉类比一九五三年同时期多二十三万三千吨，奶类多六十六万九千吨，羊毛的征购和收购量也增加了。
    在苏联畜牧业中国民经济意义很大但最落后的奶牛饲养业，在一九五四年内发展得特别快。从一九五三年十月一日到一九五四年十月一日，全国集体农庄和苏联国营农场部所属国营农场的奶牛平均都增加了百分之十二。如果加上苏联劳动者私人饲养的奶牛，去年苏联全国奶牛总数已经达到二千七百五十万头，将近达到了卫国战争前一九四○年的水平。和这同时，集体农庄的奶牛的产品生产率平均增加了百分之七。车里雅宾斯克、利森、契尔诺维齐等州的集体农庄，去年每头奶牛的牛奶产量增加了百分之三十二到四十八。
    苏联农业劳动者去年广泛展开了发展畜牧业的社会主义竞赛，争取达到可以保证充分满足居民对畜产品需要的全国标准。这个标准规定：每一百公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）耕地全年出产三吨猪肉，每一百公顷可以利用的耕地、草地和牧场有十头奶牛，全年出产二十五到二十六吨牛奶。在竞赛中，加里宁格勒州去年奶牛的头数已经增加了百分之三十。这个州的普拉夫金斯克·古里耶夫、斯拉夫斯克等区的许多集体农庄，全年每一百公顷农业用地出产了二十四到二十九吨牛奶。白俄罗斯和乌克兰共和国，以及乌拉尔、北高加索、伏尔加河流域等地的许多集体农庄和国营农场，在每一百公顷耕地上平均出产了三吨到四吨以上的猪肉。
