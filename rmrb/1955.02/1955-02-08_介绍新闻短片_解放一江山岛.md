    Introducing the Newsreel "Liberation of Yijiangshan Island"
  　Ju Sheng
    I finished watching the newsreel "Liberation of Yijiangshan Island," recently produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, with very excited feelings.
    This newsreel tells us that our people's armed forces have rapidly developed. Our glorious and ever-victorious army, in coordination with our young people's air force and navy, created the miracle of liberating Yijiangshan Island, which the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang repeatedly boasted was a modern defense, in a short period of time.
    At the beginning of the film, we see the heroic posture of our powerful air force bravely attacking the enemy's positions on Yijiangshan Island, followed by large formations of gunboats, landing craft... advancing through the vast sea, braving the wind and waves. Our military commanders are closely watching the enemy's positions, and their firm gaze shows their unparalleled confidence in liberating Yijiangshan Island.
    The battle began, and clumps of smoke rose from the hillside of the towering Yijiangshan Island (a high mountain standing in the ocean). Our gunboats fired fiercely at the enemy. Although limited by filming conditions, it was impossible to capture all the details of the enemy's stubborn resistance based on the natural defenses of Yijiangshan Island and modern fortifications, judging from the remains of the enemy's positions on Yijiangshan Island after its liberation and the enemy's wounded, it is not difficult to see that the enemy put up a serious last-ditch struggle. However, in the face of the invincible People's Liberation Army, what use was this struggle?
    Here, the photographer captured an unforgettable scene for us: among the cannon fodder scraped together by the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, there were sixty-year-old men and fifteen- or sixteen-year-old teenagers. Most prominent was a pair of fisherman father and son, who were captured by the Chiang bandits while fishing and forced to take up guns they had never held before, spending their days hiding in dark, sunless caves, living a subhuman life, until this liberation of Yijiangshan Island, when the father and son were able to reunite.
    This scene increased our boundless hatred for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The father, so thin that he was only skin and bones, with lifeless eyes, might have been a skilled fisherman if he had lived on the mainland of the motherland; the son, nestled next to his father, timidly looking at his father, might have been a lively and brave teenager if he had lived on the mainland of the motherland. But now, they have almost become sacrifices of the Chiang bandit army. Can we let them forever moan under the enemy's whip? Can we let them forever struggle on the edge of death? Can we ignore their tragic fate? We must liberate Taiwan! Fight to bring them back to the embrace of the motherland as soon as possible! After watching "Liberation of Yijiangshan Island," our confidence in liberating Taiwan has been greatly enhanced.
    We need and warmly welcome newsreels like "Liberation of Yijiangshan Island" that have great patriotic educational significance. We warmly salute the heroic soldiers who liberated Yijiangshan Island! We also salute the comrades photographers who timely and powerfully introduced this heroic feat to us!

    介绍新闻短片“解放一江山岛”
  　鞠盛
    我怀着非常激动的心情，看完了中央新闻纪录电影制片厂最近摄制的新闻短片“解放一江山岛”。
    这个新闻短片告诉我们：我国的人民武装力量已经迅速地向前发展了。我们有光荣传统、战无不胜的陆军，在我们年青的人民空军和海军的配合之下，创造了在短短时间内一举解放蒋匪帮所一再吹嘘的现代化防御的一江山岛的奇迹。
    影片一开始，就看到我们强大的空军英勇地向一江山岛敌军阵地出击的雄姿，跟着便是大队的炮艇、登陆艇……在浩阔的海面上，乘风破浪地前进。我军指挥人员，密切地注视着敌人的阵地，他们的坚定的目光，显示了他们解放一江山岛的无比的信心。
    战斗开始了，在那高耸的一江山岛（耸立在海洋中的一座高山）的山腰里，卷起了一团团的烟雾。我炮艇猛烈地向敌人射击，虽然限于拍摄条件，不可能把敌人凭着一江山岛的天险和现代化的防御工事顽强地抵抗的情况都拍出来，但从解放后的一江山岛敌军阵地所留的残痕，以及敌军负伤的情况看来，不难看出敌人是作了一番严重的垂死挣扎的。可是，在无敌的人民解放军面前，这种挣扎又有什么用处呢？
    在这里，摄影师为我们摄下了一个使人难忘的镜头：在蒋匪帮搜刮来的炮灰中，有六十岁的老头，也有十五、六岁的少年。而最突出是一对渔民父子，他们在打鱼时被蒋贼军抓去了，强迫他们拿起从未拿过的枪，终年躲在暗无天日的地洞里，过着非人的生活，直到这次一江山岛解放，他们父子才能重圆。
    这个镜头增加了我们对蒋介石卖国集团无比的愤恨。那瘦得只剩下皮包骨头、睁开没有光采的眼睛的父亲，如果生活在祖国的大陆上，也许是一名打鱼能手；那偎依在他父亲一旁，怯弱地向父亲望着的儿子，如果生活在祖国的大陆上，也可能是个活泼勇敢的少年。可是，现在他们却几乎都成为蒋贼军的牺牲品。我们能让他们永远在敌人的皮鞭下呻吟吗？我们能让他们永远在死亡的边缘挣扎吗？我们能置他们悲惨的命运于不顾吗？我们一定要解放台湾。为使他们早日回到祖国的怀抱而战斗！看了“解放一江山岛”以后，更大大地增强了我们解放台湾的信心。
    我们需要并且热烈地欢迎“解放一江山岛”这样富有重大爱国主义教育意义的新闻短片，我们热烈地向解放一江山岛的英雄的战士们致敬！同时也向及时地有力地把这一英勇事迹介绍给我们的摄影师同志致敬！
