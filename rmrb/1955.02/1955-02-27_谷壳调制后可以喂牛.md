    Rice Hulls, After Preparation, Can Be Used to Feed Cattle

    To the Editor:
    Many areas in our province suffered from flooding last year, and there is a severe shortage of feed for draft cattle. To solve the feed problem, relevant departments have researched a method of using rice hulls to compensate for the shortage of grass feed. This is because the protein content in rice hulls is as high as that in rice straw, corn stalks, and spring wheat stalks (all containing about five grams of protein per pound), making them nutritious. Mixing them with grass feed can replace about one-third to one-half of the grass feed. Moreover, rice hulls are abundant in rice-producing areas, and they are rarely used for other purposes besides fuel or bedding in cattle pens, making them cheap and easy to buy. However, rice hulls must be prepared before they can be fed to cattle. There are three preparation methods:
    First, soak them in 3% or 2% lime water (mix three or two parts of lime with one hundred parts of water to form a milky liquid) for one day. After捞起来（retrieval is implied - I'm not sure how to translate this) , rinse them with clean water, then mix them with chopped grass feed, adding a little clean water (preferably salt water) and mix well before feeding the cattle.
    Second, soak them in warm or cold water for one day and one night, then take them out, spray them with some salt water, and mix them with chopped grass feed (about two or three inches to four or five inches long) before feeding the cattle (in cold weather, to prevent freezing, add some warm water and mix a few times when feeding the cattle).
    Third, first stir-fry them dry in a pot or dry them in the sun, then soften or crush them with a stone mill or roller, add some water (use warm water in cold weather) and salt water, and mix them with the grass feed before feeding the cattle.
    When feeding cattle, pay attention to the following: do not use too much rice hull at the beginning; gradually increase the amount after the cattle have eaten it for a few days and have adapted to the taste. After feeding the cattle with rice hulls, be sure to give them enough water to drink (feed them warm water in cold weather) to prevent constipation.
    The problem of livestock lacking grass is not only present in the disaster areas of Hubei, but also in other regions. Therefore, I am sharing this method for reference.

### 谷壳调制后可以喂牛

    谷壳调制后可以喂牛编辑同志：
    我省不少地区去年遭受了水灾，耕牛的饲料都很缺乏。为了解决饲料问题，有关部门研究出用谷壳代替草料不足的方法。因为谷壳里所含的蛋白质和稻草、玉茭秆、春小麦秆里所含的蛋白质的分量一样多（都是每一斤里含蛋白质五公分左右），富于营养，拌和在草料里喂牛，可以抵上草料的三分之一到一半左右；而且在水稻区产的谷壳很多，平时除用它作燃料或铺垫牛栏外，很少作其他用途，价格便宜又容易买到。但谷壳必须经过调制后才能喂牛。调制的方法有下列三种：一、用百分之三或百分之二的石灰水（即一百份水内加三份或二份石灰搅和成乳状液）浸泡一天，捞起来后，用清水淘一遍，再掺入铡短的草料内，加点清水（最好是盐水）拌匀后喂牛。二、用温水或冷水浸泡一天一夜后，取出来喷洒一些盐水，再拌和铡短的（大约二、三寸到四、五寸长）草料喂牛（冷天为了防止冰冻，在给牛吃的时候要加一些温热水拌几下）。三、先用锅炒干或晒干，再用碾子或石磙压软或磨碎后，加些水（冷天要用温热水）和盐水拌在草料中喂牛。
    在喂牛的时候，还要注意：开始用谷壳时不要用得太多，等牛吃了几天适合口味后再逐渐加多；牛喂了谷壳以后要注意给牛喝足够的水（冷天要喂温热水），以防便结。
    牲口缺草问题不仅是湖北灾区存在的问题，其他地区也有类似情况，因此，特将这一办法介绍出来供参考。湖北荆州专署　伍瑞阶
