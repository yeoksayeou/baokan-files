    The Shuangyashan Lingxi Shaft in Heilongjiang Province, a high-quality coking coal mine designed and built by China itself, was completed on February 15th. On the same day, a grand engineering acceptance, handover, and production signing ceremony was held at the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau.
    The Lingxi Shaft is another pair of modern vertical shafts newly built in China. The designed output of these shafts is very large, with an annual output equivalent to more than twice the total output of the entire Shuangyashan Coal Mine in 1949. The main production processes are all mechanized. The construction project of this mine is very large. In more than two years, the mine construction workers excavated more than 50,000 cubic meters of rock from the underground, more than 150 meters from the surface, developed underground roadways dozens of miles in radius, and built more than 30 buildings on the ground plaza.
    At the engineering acceptance, handover, and production signing ceremony, Xue Qi, Chairman of the Acceptance Committee appointed by the state and Deputy Director of the Northeast Coal Mine Administration, announced that the Shuangyashan Lingxi Shaft, after inspection by the Acceptance Committee, fully meets the requirements for handover to production and will be officially put into full production starting from the 15th. Comrade An. Fei. Dirilenko, a Soviet expert who helped with China's coal mine construction, congratulated the completion of the Lingxi Shaft at the meeting and wished the production victory.

    新建近代化的双鸭山岭西竖井开始生产
    由我国自己设计和建设的优质炼焦煤矿——黑龙江省双鸭山岭西竖井，在二月十五日已建成，当天在双鸭山矿务局隆重举行了工程验收移交生产签字大会。
    岭西竖井是我国新建成的又一对近代化的竖井。这对竖井的设计产量很大，年产量相等于一九四九年全双鸭山煤矿产量的两倍以上。主要生产过程全部是机械化。这个矿井的建设工程非常庞大，建井工人们在两年多的时间从离地表一百五十多公尺的地下开凿出五万多立方公尺的岩石，开拓了方圆数十华里的地下巷道，并在地面广场上建设成三十多项建筑物。
    在工程验收移交生产签字大会上，由国家任命的验收委员会主席、东北煤矿管理局副局长薛奇宣布：双鸭山岭西竖井经验收委员会验收结果完全符合移交生产使用的要求，从十五日开始全面地正式投入生产。帮助我国煤矿建设的苏联专家安·费·季里连柯同志在会上对岭西竖井的建成表示祝贺，并预祝生产的胜利。　（本报集体通讯员双鸭山工人报编辑部）
