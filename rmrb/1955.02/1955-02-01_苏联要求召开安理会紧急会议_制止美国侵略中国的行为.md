Xinhua News Agency, January 31st, TASS, New York, January 31st: Soviet Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations Security Council, Mr. Sobolev, sent the following letter to the President of the Security Council, Mr. Munro, on January 30th:

    "The interference of the United States of America in the internal affairs of China and the recent expansion of American acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan area have aggravated the tension in the Far East and deepened the danger of a new war.

    In view of the above, the Security Council should take urgent steps to stop American aggression against the People's Republic of China and American interference in China's internal affairs.

    Therefore, I am instructed to request you, Mr. President, to convene an emergency meeting of the Security Council to consider the acts of aggression by the United States of America against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan area.

    Attached hereto is a draft resolution of the Security Council on this matter."

    The draft resolution is as follows:

    "The Security Council,

    Considering the acts of aggression by the United States of America against the People's Republic of China in the area of Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and other Chinese coastal islands occupied by the United States, the specific manifestations of which are unwarranted armed attacks on Chinese cities and coastal areas by armed forces under American control, the concentration of American naval and air forces in the aforementioned areas, and official statements by American politicians threatening to use armed forces against the People's Republic of China;

    Considering that the aforementioned actions of the United States are aggression against the People's Republic of China and are clearly incompatible with the obligations undertaken by the United States under relevant international agreements regarding Taiwan and other Chinese islands, which constitute an integral part of Chinese national territory;

    Further recognizing that the actions taken by the United States armed forces in the area of Taiwan and other Chinese islands are violations of the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter, a blatant interference in China's internal affairs, and the source of tension in the Far East, posing a threat to peace and security in that region;

    Resolves to condemn the acts of aggression by the United States of America against the People's Republic of China;

    Recommends that the Government of the United States of America immediately take steps to terminate the aforementioned acts of aggression and its interference in China's internal affairs;

    Recommends that the Government of the United States of America immediately withdraw all its air, naval, and land forces from Taiwan Island and all other territories belonging to China;

    Appeals to all parties to prevent military action in the Taiwan area in order to facilitate the withdrawal of all armed forces not belonging to the People's Republic of China from the islands in that area."

    苏联要求召开安理会紧急会议
    制止美国侵略中国的行为
    【新华社三十一日讯】塔斯社纽约三十一日讯：苏联常驻联合国安全理事会副代表索波列夫一月三十日送给安全理事会主席孟罗先生下面的信件：
    “美利坚合众国干涉中国内政以及美国最近在台湾地区扩大对中华人民共和国的侵略行为，加剧了远东的紧张局势和加深了新战争的危险。
    鉴于上述情况，安全理事会应该采取紧急步骤，以制止美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为和美国对中国内政的干涉。
    因此，我奉命要求您，主席先生，召开安全理事会紧急会议，以考虑美利坚合众国在台湾地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为。
    随信附上安全理事会关于这个问题的决议草案。”
    这个决议草案如下：
    “安全理事会，
    考虑到美利坚合众国在台湾、澎湖以及被美国霸占的其他中国沿海岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为，其具体表现是受美国控制的武装部队对中国城市和沿海地方进行无端的武装攻击、美国海空军部队集中在上述地区、以及美国政治家的官方声明威胁要使用武装部队对付中华人民共和国；
    考虑到美国的上述行为是对中华人民共和国的侵略，并且是同美国根据关于构成中国国家领土不可分割的一部分的台湾和其他中国岛屿的相应国际协定所承担的义务显然不相容的；
    进一步认识到美国武装部队在台湾和其他中国岛屿地区采取的行动是违反联合国宪章的基本原则、悍然干涉中国内政的行为，这些行动是造成远东紧张局势的根源，是对那个地区的和平和安全的威胁；
    为谴责美利坚合众国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为；
    建议美国政府立即采取步骤，以终止上述侵略行为和它对中国内政的干涉；
    建议美利坚合众国政府立即从台湾岛和属于中国的其他一切领土撤退它的一切空、海、陆军部队；
    吁请任何一方防止在台湾地区的军事行动以便于不属于中华人民共和国的一切武装部队从那个地区的岛屿撤退。”
