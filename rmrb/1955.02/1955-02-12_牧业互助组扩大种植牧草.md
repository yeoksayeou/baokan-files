The Chao Gejile and Hao Baosuo pastoral mutual aid teams in the Junwang Banner of the Yikezhao League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, harvested more than 32,000 jin of forage grass in their trial planting last year. During the time when snowflakes were flying and the pastures were frozen, these grasses ensured that the livestock safely weathered the disaster period. Not long ago, they also formulated a plan to expand the planting of forage and feed this year. This year, they decided to plant 395 mu of forage and feed, including naked oats, corn, alfalfa, millet, and barnyard grass. These are all nutritious and suitable high-quality forage and feed crops for local planting. The team members estimate that, in an average harvest year, they can reap 186 shi of feed and 140,000 jin of forage.

    牧业互助组扩大种植牧草
    内蒙古自治区伊克昭盟郡王旗朝格吉勒、郝宝锁两个牧业互助组，去年试种牧草共收获了三万二千多斤。正当雪花纷飞，牧场封冻的时候，由于有了这些牧草，使牲畜安全渡过灾期。不久前，他们又制订了今年扩种牧草和饲料的计划。今年他们决定种植三百九十五亩牧草和饲料，里面有青莜麦、玉茭、苜蓿草、青谷子和稗子，这些全是富有营养价值并适宜于当地种植的优良牧草和饲料。组员们估计，这些草料在普通收成年头，也可收获一百八十六石饲料和十四万斤饲草。
