Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 19th. News from Karlsruhe: The West German Federal Constitutional Court continued its illegal "trial" of the German Communist Party on the 17th. The legal representatives of the German Communist Party requested a postponement of the "trial" in order to prepare a reply to the so-called "evidence" presented to the court by representatives of the Bonn government during the recent "trial." The court announced that the "trial" would be postponed until March 1st, the third postponement since the "trial" of the German Communist Party began on November 23rd last year.

At the "trial" on the 17th, the German Communist Party's legal representative, Krüger, delivered a lengthy speech. Krüger once again proved that the entire "trial" was inadmissible, and then exposed the background of the "trial" and the reasons why the Bonn government decided to adopt such a policy precisely at this time. Krüger said that Adenauer's main purpose was to try to oppose the policy of peaceful coexistence. He said that the Bonn government was attempting to use the trial of Marxism-Leninism, especially the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, to launch attacks on socialism and socialist countries.

Krüger's speech caused obvious unease in the court.

    西德法院宣布延期“审讯”德共
    【新华社柏林十九日电】加尔斯卢合消息：西德联邦宪法法院十七日继续对德国共产党进行非法“审讯”。德国共产党的法律代表们要求延期“审讯”，以便准备对波恩政府代表在最近“审讯”中向法庭提出的所谓“证件”的答复。法庭宣布“审讯”延期到三月一日，这是去年十一月二十三日开始“审讯”德国共产党以来的第三次延期。
    十七日“审讯”时，德国共产党法律代表克吕格尔发表长篇演说。克吕格尔再一次证明了整个“审讯”是不能容许的，他接着揭露了这次“审讯”的背景和波恩政府恰恰在目前这个时候决定采取这种政策的原因。克吕格尔说：阿登纳的主要目的是要竭力反对和平共处的政策。他说，波恩政府企图利用对马克思—列宁主义，特别是对无产阶级专政学说的审判，来发动对社会主义和社会主义国家的攻击。
    克吕格尔的演说在法庭中引起了明显的不安。
