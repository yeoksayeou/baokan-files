Atomic Energy Must Serve Peace and Progress
Dapu Sheng, Vice Chairman of the China Islamic Association

The U.S. imperialists are frantically preparing for new wars, seriously threatening world peace. This unbridled tyranny has reached an unprecedented level. Not only is U.S. imperialism occupying our territory of Taiwan, but it has also fabricated the "Paris Agreements" in Europe, stepping up the arming of West Germany, and openly and arrogantly clamoring for the use of atomic weapons to wage war. This series of fire-setting actions has aroused the anger of our six hundred million people and all righteous people in the world. For this reason, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council issued a "Message to the Peoples of the World" on January 19th of this year, calling on the people of the world to launch a signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons. Subsequently, the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace held a joint enlarged meeting and passed a "Resolution on Launching a Signature Campaign Against the Use of Atomic Weapons," calling on the people of the whole country to launch a signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons. We warmly respond to this call. I believe that the ten ethnic groups in our country who believe in Islam, like other ethnic groups, will certainly act in unison with the people of the world, enthusiastically respond to this call, and support this great struggle to defend world peace by signing their names in the cause of peace, giving a resolute rebuff to those who clamor for atomic war!

The discovery of atomic energy, especially its utilization for peaceful purposes, is a great scientific achievement; it can provide unlimited power for production and can help people solve many problems in medicine, biology, and other fields that have not yet been resolved. Therefore, the widespread development of the peaceful uses of atomic energy will bring great benefits to mankind.

Everyone knows that the Soviet Union has been making unremitting efforts in the research of peaceful uses of atomic energy. As early as June of last year, the Soviet Union had already built the world's first atomic energy industrial power plant. This exciting event aroused the joy and encouragement of progressive people all over the world. In January of this year, the Soviet government issued a statement deciding to provide comprehensive technical assistance to our country, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and the German Democratic Republic to carry out broader research in the peaceful uses of atomic energy. Moreover, the Soviet government is considering expanding the scope of the countries to be assisted. This fact is further proof of the Soviet Union's advocacy of the peaceful use of atomic energy and is the result of the consistent implementation of the Soviet Union's peaceful policy.

However, on the other hand, U.S. imperialism is trying its best to prevent the peaceful use of atomic energy, plotting a large-scale destructive atomic war. Although U.S. imperialism has long lost its monopoly on atomic weapons, it still clamors for the use of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, vainly attempting to achieve its goal of occupying other countries' territories and intimidating peace-loving people.

At successive sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, the aggressive bloc headed by U.S. imperialism has been obstructing the reaching of agreements on the issues of disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons. Disregarding the opposition of the people of the world, it adopted a decision on the use of nuclear weapons at the Paris meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council in December last year. This shows that U.S. imperialism is determined to force mankind toward a devastating war.

However, the more than two billion people of the world will never allow a handful of warmongers to dominate them. The people will solemnly warn those mad war-mongers: those who play with fire will surely be burned, those who play with water will surely drown, and the war-mongers' adventurous plans will surely be completely shattered by the people.

The people of the world must unite closely and respond to the call of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council. Standing from the perspective of a follower of Islam, I call on Muslims who believe in Islam all over the world: loving peace and opposing war is the essence of our faith. We must unite to oppose war, oppose the use of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and firmly advocate that atomic energy should serve the peace and progress of all mankind.

    必须使原子能为和平和进步服务
    中国伊斯兰教协会副主任　达浦生
    美帝国主义者正疯狂地准备新的战争，严重地威胁着世界和平，这种横行霸道已达到了史无前例的地步。美帝国主义不仅侵占我国领土台湾，在欧洲还制造了“巴黎协定”，加紧武装西德，公然狂妄地叫嚣使用原子武器进行战争。这一连串准备放火的行动，已引起我国六亿人民和全世界正义人士的愤怒，为此，世界和平理事会常务委员会在本年一月十九日发表了“告全世界人民书”，号召全世界人民展开反对使用原子武器的签名运动。接着，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员召开联席扩大会议，通过了“关于发动反对使用原子武器签名运动的决议”，号召全国人民展开签名运动，反对使用原子武器。我们热烈响应这一号召。我相信，我国信仰伊斯兰教的十个民族同其他民族一样，一定和全世界的人民一致行动，踊跃响应这一号召，以签上自己爱好和平的名字来支持这一具有伟大意义的保卫世界和平的斗争，给原子战争的叫嚣者以坚决的回击！
    原子能的被发现，特别是它在和平用途上的被利用，是科学上的巨大成果；它能够在生产上提供无限的动力，能够帮助人们解决在医学、生物学等等方面迄今还不能解决的很多问题。因此，广泛地开展原子能和平用途的研究将给人类带来极大的福利。
    谁都知道苏联在和平利用原子能的研究方面，一直作着不懈的努力。早在去年六月，苏联即已建成了世界上第一座原子能工业电力站。这一令人兴奋的事件，曾引起了全世界进步人类的欢欣鼓舞。今年一月，苏联政府又发表声明：决定给予我国和波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、德意志民主共和国提供全面的技术援助，以便在和平利用原子能方面展开更广泛的研究。并且苏联政府还正在考虑扩大被援助国家的范围。这一事实是苏联主张和平利用原子能的进一步证明，也是苏联所一贯履行的和平政策的贯彻结果。
    可是另一方面，美帝国主义却极力阻止原子能的和平利用，阴谋准备大规模毁灭性的原子战争。尽管美帝国主义早已失去原子武器的垄断地位，可是它仍然叫嚣使用原子武器和氢武器，妄想借以达到其霸占别国领土，恐吓爱好和平的人民的目的。
    在历届联合国大会上，以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团，一直阻挠关于裁减军备和禁止原子武器的问题达成协议，并且不顾全世界人民的反对，于去年十二月在北大西洋联盟理事会巴黎会议上通过了使用核子武器的决定。这就说明美帝国主义决心要迫使人类走向毁灭性的战争。
    但是，全世界二十多亿人民决不会听任少数战争贩子支配，人民将正告那些丧心病狂的战争叫嚣者们：玩火者必将自焚，玩水者一定灭顶，战争贩子的冒险计划一定要被人民彻底粉碎。
    全世界人民必须紧密地团结起来，响应世界和平理事会常务委员会的号召。我站在伊斯兰教信徒一分子的立场向全世界信仰伊斯兰教穆斯林们呼吁：爱好和平反对战争是我们信仰的本质，我们要一致起来反对战争，反对使用原子武器和氢武器，坚决主张使原子能为全人类的和平与进步服务。
