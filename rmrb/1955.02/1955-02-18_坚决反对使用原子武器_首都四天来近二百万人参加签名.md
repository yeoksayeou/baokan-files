Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons in the capital has become known to every household. The Beijing Municipal People's Committee for the Signature Campaign Against the Use of Atomic Weapons announced today that more than 1,894,000 people have signed "An Appeal to the People of the World."

In recent days, the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons has spread throughout the city and suburban rural areas. In the 23 large and small alleys of Niujie, a Hui Muslim community, crowds of people signed their names in an endless stream, and Li Xiuying, a blind girl, appeared in the crowd for the first time in several years. At a signature venue in the city, an elderly Christian woman, Grandma Bian, said to the people around her as she walked into the venue: "Regardless of whether you believe in religion or not, the desire for peace is the same!" In Wulitun, a mountain village, more than 800 people have signed their names from the 15th to the present. In Lugouqiao Township, where the Japanese imperialists launched a full-scale invasion of China in 1937, 80% of the township's population has signed their names.

More than 2,000 scientific and literary and art workers who serve the peaceful construction of the motherland held rallies today to oppose the use of atomic weapons. As of 10 p.m., scientists were still signing under the lights.

Today, in front of Tiananmen Square, the defenders of peace of the motherland gathered - soldiers from the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing and public security forces guarding Tiananmen Square. They solemnly signed their names, condemning the American imperialists' attempt to use atomic weapons to threaten the Chinese people.

    坚决反对使用原子武器
    首都四天来近二百万人参加签名
    【新华社十七日讯】首都人民反对使用原子武器签名运动已经家喻户晓。北京市人民反对使用原子武器签名运动委员会今日宣布：在“告全世界人民书”上签名的已达一百八十九万四千多人。
    连日来，反对使用原子武器签名运动已普及全城和郊区农村。回民聚居的牛街二十三个大小胡同，签名的人群络绎不绝，双目失明的女孩子李秀英数年来第一次出现在人群中。在市内一处签名会场上，有一位白发苍苍的基督徒边老太太，她在走进会场时就向身旁的人说：“不管信不信教，要和平的心愿是一样的！”在山村五里屯，从十五日开始到现在已有八百多人签了名。一九三七年日本帝国主义向我国发动全面侵略开始的地方——芦沟桥乡人民签名的已达全乡人口的百分之八十。
    为祖国和平建设服务的两千多名科学工作者和文学艺术工作者，今天分别举行了反对使用原子武器的集会。到晚间十时，科学家们仍在灯下签名。
    今天在天安门前，聚集着祖国和平的保卫者——中国人民解放军驻京部队和守卫天安门的公安部队的战士们，他们庄严地签上自己的名字，谴责美帝国主义妄图用原子武器来威胁中国人民。
