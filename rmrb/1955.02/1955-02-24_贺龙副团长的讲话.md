Comrade Ambassador, Comrades Soldiers and Non-Commissioned Officers, Comrades Officers and Generals:

    The Soviet army is the world's first brand-new people's army and also the world's most powerful army. It has victoriously defended the achievements of the Soviet socialist revolution and socialist construction. In the Second World War, it defeated the German and Japanese fascist armies and saved all mankind from the grave threat of fascist enslavement. After the war, it stood like a pillar, safeguarding international peace, so that the aggressive forces headed by U.S. imperialism did not dare to act rashly. This is why not only the Soviet people, but all progressive mankind, warmly celebrate the Soviet Army Day as their own glorious festival.

    What the Chinese people particularly cannot forget is that the Soviet army annihilated the main force of the Japanese imperialist army and helped China win the final victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan. In accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and related agreements, the Soviet army defended the Lushunkou Naval Base together with the Chinese People's Liberation Army, safeguarding China's security and peace in the Far East. The Chinese people will always express their gratitude for this. The Chinese people regard the Soviet people and the Soviet army as their most loyal and closest friends. The Chinese people will feel infinite nostalgia for the Soviet army that is about to withdraw from the Lushunkou Naval Base and return home.

    The Chinese People's Liberation Army was built from the very beginning by taking the Soviet army as an example. Now, they are learning Soviet advanced military science and technology with great enthusiasm, making themselves a more powerful and modernized revolutionary army. The strong unity of the people and armies of China and the Soviet Union cannot be destroyed by any enemy and is a reliable guarantee of world peace and international security.

    Now, the U.S. aggressive bloc is actively pursuing a policy of war in the world, carrying out atomic blackmail, and creating international tension. It is particularly outrageous that after the United States occupied China's Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, it recently deployed troops in the Taiwan Strait, wantonly engaging in war provocations and interfering in China's internal affairs. The U.S. imperialists actually regard the efforts made by the Chinese and Soviet people to strive for world peace and ease international tensions as a sign of weakness. However, their calculations are wrong. The Chinese people and the Soviet people love peace, but we are never afraid of war. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan. The Chinese people are fully capable of completing the sacred task of liberating Taiwan. The people of China and the Soviet Union, together with peace-loving people all over the world, are fully capable of completely shattering any imperialist aggression plans. If the aggressors dare to launch a war, then they will certainly not escape the tragic and disgraceful end of the Hitler gang and the Japanese militarists.

    On the occasion of the 37th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, please allow me to extend warm congratulations to the heroic and invincible Soviet Army on behalf of the Chinese people, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and to express my highest respect to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Government, who created and led the Soviet Army. Let us:

    For the heroic Soviet Army,
    For the close unity of the armed forces of China and the Soviet Union,
    For the permanent and unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union,
    For the consolidation of peace in the Far East and the world, cheers!

### 贺龙副团长的讲话

    贺龙副团长的讲话大使同志、战士和士官同志们、军官和将军同志们：
    苏联军队是世界上第一支崭新的人民的军队，也是世界上最强大的军队。它胜利地保卫了苏联社会主义革命和社会主义建设的成果。在第二次世界大战中，它打败了德日法西斯军队，把全人类从法西斯奴役的严重威胁下拯救了出来。在战后，它又像中流砥柱一样地捍卫着国际和平，使以美帝国主义为首的侵略势力不敢轻举妄动。这就是为什么不仅苏联人民，而且全体进步人类都把苏联建军节当成自己的光荣节日而热烈地加以庆祝的缘故。
    中国人民特别不能忘记的，是苏联军队歼灭了日本帝国主义军队的主力，帮助中国赢得了抗日战争的最后胜利。苏联军队根据中苏友好同盟互助条约及其有关协定，同中国人民解放军一起防守旅顺口海军根据地，保卫了中国的安全和远东的和平，中国人民对此将永远表示感谢。中国人民把苏联人民和苏联军队看成是自己最忠诚和最亲密的朋友。对于将要从旅顺口海军根据地撤离回国的苏联军队，中国人民将感到无限的怀念。
    中国人民解放军一开始就是以苏联军队作榜样建设起来的。现在，他们正以高度的热情学习苏联先进的军事科学和技术，使自己成为一支更强大的现代化的革命军队。中苏两国人民及其军队的坚强团结，是任何敌人也不能摧毁的，是世界和平和国际安全的可靠保证。
    现在，美国侵略集团正在世界上积极推行战争政策，进行原子恫吓，制造国际紧张局势。特别令人愤慨的是美国在侵占中国的台湾和澎湖列岛以后，最近更陈兵台湾海峡，肆意进行战争挑衅和干涉中国内政。美帝国主义者竟把中苏两国人民为争取世界和平和缓和国际紧张局势而作的努力看成是软弱的表现，可是，他们的算盘打错了。中国人民和苏联人民是热爱和平的，但是我们绝不害怕战争。中国人民一定要解放台湾。中国人民完全有力量完成解放台湾的神圣任务。中苏两国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，完全能够彻底粉碎帝国主义的任何侵略计划。如果侵略者胆敢发动战争，那么，他们就一定逃不脱希特勒匪帮和日本军国主义者的悲惨和可耻的下场。
    值此苏联建军三十七周年纪念日，请允许我代表中国人民、中华人民共和国政府和中国人民解放军，向英勇无敌的苏联军队致以热烈的祝贺，向创造和领导苏联军队的苏联共产党和苏联政府表示崇高的敬意。让我们：
    为英雄的苏联军队，
    为中苏两国武装力量的亲密团结，
    为中苏两国人民永久的牢不可破的友谊，
    为远东和世界和平的巩固，干杯！
