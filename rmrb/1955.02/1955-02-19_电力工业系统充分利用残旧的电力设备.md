The electricity industry will fully utilize old and obsolete electrical equipment this year to accelerate industrial construction and save funds. This year, there are twenty-four projects for dismantling and restoring old and obsolete equipment. These twenty-four projects include twenty-seven steam turbine generators and thirty-nine boilers. The total capacity of the steam turbine generators is 148,000 kilowatts. Nineteen of these, with a capacity of 100,450 kilowatts, are expected to be fully or partially put into production this year.

This year, it is planned to dismantle more than a dozen small power generation equipment sets from Shenyang, Harbin, Fushun, Changchun, Xiangzhong, and other places, and relocate them to the construction sites of Baotou, Lanzhou, and the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant for installation, to supply electricity for the basic construction of 141 large-scale projects. One 14,000 kilowatt and one 15,000 kilowatt power generation equipment set dismantled from Fuxin and Jinxi will make up for the power shortages in the two industrial cities of Shanghai and Wuhan. This year, in the coal mining areas of Jiaozuo, Zixing, Datong, Huainan, Fengfeng, Zaozhuang, Hongshan, and other places, old and obsolete power generation equipment will be restored, some of which have been dismantled from other places. After the restoration of these old and obsolete equipment, they can supply electricity for the production of these coal mines and provide standby equipment for safe production. This year, three small power generation equipment sets will be restored in Hohhot and Jining, Inner Mongolia, to supply electricity to ethnic minority areas and railway connecting lines.

Among the steam turbine generators scheduled for restoration and construction in 1955, eleven are damaged machines that have been destroyed by war and have been in disrepair for a long time. However, after we re-inspect, repair, and reconfigure them, and improve some unreasonable equipment, they can be used as new machines. The total capacity of these eleven generators is 62,500 kilowatts, which can supply electricity for twenty-five spinning mills with 50,000 spindles each. The cost of restoring and rebuilding old and obsolete equipment is very low, only equivalent to one-fifth to two-fifths of the cost of building a new power station of the same size, which means that more than 300 billion yuan can be saved.

    电力工业系统充分利用残旧的电力设备
    为了加速工业建设，节约资金，今年我国电力工业将充分利用残旧的电力设备。今年有二十四项拆迁和恢复残旧设备的工程。这二十四项工程包括二十七台汽轮发电机和三十九台锅炉。汽轮发电机的总容量为十四万八千瓩。今年能够全部或部分投入生产的有十九台，容量为十万零四千五百瓩。
    今年拟从沈阳、哈尔滨、抚顺、长春、湘中等地拆迁十几套小型发电设备，移装到包头、兰州和第一座拖拉机制造厂工地安装，供给一百四十一项巨大工程的基本建设用电。从阜新、锦西拆迁的一台一万四千瓩和一台一万五千瓩的发电设备，弥补上海、武汉两个工业城市电力的不足。今年在焦作、资兴、大同、淮南、峰峰、枣庄、洪山等煤矿地区，都将恢复残旧发电设备，其中有的是从别处拆迁来的。这些残旧设备恢复建成后，可供应这些煤矿生产用电和安全生产的备用设备。今年将在内蒙古呼和浩特和集宁两市恢复三台小型发电设备。供给少数民族地区和铁路联运线的用电。
    列入一九五五年恢复修建的汽轮发电机，其中有十一台是经过战争破坏、长期失修的残破机器，但是经过我们重新检修配制，并改进一些不合理的设备后，就可以当新机器使用。这十一台发电机的总容量有六万二千五百瓩，可以供给二十五个五万纱锭的纱厂用电。恢复和改建残旧设备成本很低，只相当于建设同样大的新电站的五分之一到五分之二，就是说可以节省三千多亿元。
