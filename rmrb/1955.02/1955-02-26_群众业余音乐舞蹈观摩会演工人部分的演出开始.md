The mass amateur music and dance festival workers' performance, jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the New Democratic Youth League of China, the Ministry of Higher Education of the People's Republic of China, and the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China, opened in Beijing on the evening of the 23rd. Two hundred and seven worker-actors from factories and enterprises in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Shenyang, Lüda, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Wuhan, and other cities, as well as various units of the China Railway Trade Union system, are participating in this performance. Among them, nine are model workers or advanced workers, and forty-nine have received awards in production or work. The one hundred and nine music and dance programs participating in the performance were selected from employee cultural performances held in the aforementioned regions and units last year or at the beginning of this year. Some of the programs were created by the workers themselves. In the regional cultural performances, more than sixteen thousand seven hundred employee actors performed more than one thousand seven hundred and ninety programs.
    Zhang Xiuzhu, Director of the Propaganda Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke at the opening ceremony. He said: At present, there has been great development in employees' amateur artistic activities. According to incomplete statistics from cities such as Guangzhou, Shanghai, Lüda, Shenyang, Tianjin, Wuhan, and the China Railway Trade Union system alone, there are currently two thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven amateur art organizations for drama, music, and dance, with more than seventy-five thousand employees regularly participating in performances. He also said: Employees' amateur artistic activities are one of the powerful forms for trade unions to carry out communist education among the masses of employees, and also an important method to organize employees' cultural rest and enhance their physical and mental health. He hopes that through this performance, employees' amateur artistic activities can be improved from the existing basis.
    After the opening ceremony, representatives from the worker teams of Tianjin and Shenyang performed twenty-one programs.

    群众业余音乐舞蹈观摩会演工人部分的演出开始
    中华人民共和国文化部、中华全国总工会、中国新民主主义青年团、中华人民共和国高等教育部、中华人民共和国教育部等五个单位联合举办的群众业余音乐舞蹈观摩演出会工人部分的演出，二十三日晚在北京开幕。参加这次观摩演出的有来自北京、天津、上海、沈阳、旅大、重庆、广州、武汉等市的厂矿、企业部门和中国铁路工会系统各单位的二百零七个职工演员。其中有九个人是劳动模范或先进工作者，有四十九个人曾在生产或工作中受到奖励。参加观摩演出的一百零九个音乐舞蹈节目是从上述各地区、单位在去年或今年年初举行的职工文艺会演中选出的。有一部分节目是工人自己创作的。在各地区性的文艺会演中，有一万六千七百多个职工演员演出了一千七百九十多个节目。
    中华全国总工会宣传部部长张修竹在开幕式上讲话。他说：目前，职工业余艺术活动已有很大的发展，仅就广州、上海、旅大、沈阳、天津、武汉等市和中国铁路工会系统的不完全统计，目前已有戏剧、音乐、舞蹈等业余艺术组织二千八百六十七个，经常参加演出的职工有七万五千多人。他还说：职工业余艺术活动是工会向职工群众进行共产主义教育的有力形式之一，也是组织职工文化休息，增进职工身心健康的重要方法之一。他希望通过这次观摩演出，能使职工业余艺术活动从现有基础上提高一步。
    开幕式结束后，由天津和沈阳市的工人代表队演出二十一个节目。
