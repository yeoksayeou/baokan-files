Anshan Iron and Steel Company's basic construction workers have created a good start for the comprehensive and balanced completion of the 1955 construction tasks, having completed 101% of the January engineering plan. According to calculations, the amount of work completed this month is more than that completed in January and February of last year combined.

    The engineering tasks undertaken by the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's basic construction department this year will increase by nearly double compared to last year, accounting for approximately 27% of the Five-Year Plan investment. Faced with this arduous task, the company's vast number of cadres and workers began construction preparation work as early as July of last year. At the beginning of this year, under the slogan of "hurry at the beginning, not at the end," a widespread competition was launched to strive to complete and overfulfill this year's engineering plan, especially the engineering plans for January and the first quarter.

    In early January, Anshan City had heavy snow, and the accumulated snow submerged many ground projects. In order to realize the conditions for competition, the workers swept away ice and snow while continuing construction, ensuring that the project continued without interruption. After the heavy snow, the weather became even colder, but the workers in the high-altitude, ground, and underground sites still worked as usual. The excavation workers of the Rolling Mill Construction Engineering Company could not complete their tasks every day. Later, they studied using red-hot pliers to punch holes, and then installed explosives for blasting, which increased work efficiency by five times, and the situation of not being able to complete the plan was immediately changed. When the bricklayers at the Refractory Materials Factory construction site were laying bricks, the problem of mortar freezing could not be solved. Soviet experts suggested that they use potassium carbonate and water to mix the slurry, which not only smoothly solved the difficulties in construction technology, but also improved work efficiency. In late January, the Spring Festival holiday arrived. Many workers from the Rolling Mill Construction Engineering Company, Steelmaking Construction Engineering Company, and Electrical Installation Engineering Company, seeing that the engineering tasks were so heavy, took the initiative to propose the slogan of not going home for the Spring Festival.

    鞍钢基本建设职工今年第一个月取得成就
    鞍山钢铁公司基本建设职工为全面地均衡地完成一九五五年建设任务创造了良好的开端，已完成一月份工程计划百分之一百○一。据计算，这个月完成的工作量比去年一、二两个月完成得还多。
    鞍钢基本建设部门今年担负的工程任务，比去年增加将近一倍，约占五年计划投资的百分之二十七。面对着这一繁重的任务，该公司广大干部和职工，从去年七月份就开始了施工准备工作，今年一开始，就在“赶前不赶后”的口号下广泛展开了为争取完成和提前完成今年工程计划特别是一月份和第一季度的工程计划的竞赛。　　一月初旬，鞍山市落了大雪，积雪淹没了许多地面工程。为了实现竞赛条件，工人们一边扫铲冰雪，一边坚持施工，保证了工程不间断地进行。大雪过后，天气更加寒冷，但是各个工地的高空、地面和地下的工人们，仍然照常工作。轧钢建筑工程公司的挖土工人们挖土时，每天都完不成任务。后来他们研究用烧红了的钳子打眼，然后装上炸药爆破，工作效率提高五倍，完不成计划的局面立刻改变了。耐火材料厂工地的砌砖工人们，在砌砖时，灰浆冻结的问题不能解决，苏联专家建议他们采用炭酸钾和水调浆，不仅施工技术上的困难顺利解决了，也提高了工作效率。一月下旬，春节的假期到来了。轧钢建筑工程公司、炼钢建筑工程公司和电气安装工程公司的许多工人眼看着工程任务那样繁重，主动提出春节不回家的口号。
