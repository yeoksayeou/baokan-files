    Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee
    Directs All Regions to Launch Spring Hygiene Campaign
    The Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee has instructed local Patriotic Health Campaign Committees to launch a spring patriotic hygiene campaign.
    The instructions pointed out: Spring is the season when various disease-carrying pests emerge from hibernation, hatch, and breed. Based on past experiences in the patriotic health campaign, mobilizing the masses to carry out cleaning and hygiene work in the spring plays a very good role in preventing the spread of disease, improving people's health, and ensuring industrial and agricultural production. This year, it should continue to be carried out. In cities, the spring patriotic health campaign should cooperate with industrial production and national economic construction. In rural areas, it should be combined with spring plowing, fertilization, and prevention of livestock diseases, etc., to improve environmental and personal hygiene. Each province and city can proceed from its actual conditions, focusing on preventing diseases that seriously endanger the local people, and under the unified leadership and arrangement of the local Party and government, select a time to carry out cleaning and hygiene work. Attention should be paid to doing a good job of publicity and mobilization beforehand. (Xinhua News Agency)
