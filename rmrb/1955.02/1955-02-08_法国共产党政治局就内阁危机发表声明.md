Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 7th: TASS reports: The Politburo of the French Communist Party has issued a statement on the cabinet crisis. The statement points out: The reason Communist Party deputies voted in favor of Mendès-France when he took office was that he advocated ending the war in Indochina at that time. But later, he immediately adopted the policy of arming West Germany and embarked on a path of hostile actions toward the working class, the demands and wishes of the working class. Like his predecessors, he acted as a pawn of big capitalists executing the aggressive policies of American and British imperialists. He listened to their demands and supported the practice of using the Paris Accords to arm Germany, and made the National Assembly approve the Paris Accords.

The Politburo statement then pointed out that the French bourgeoisie is trying to resolve this cabinet crisis by putting people who will implement the same policies into the government. However, this cabinet crisis once again emphasizes two basic views that are increasingly supported by the French people: changing foreign policy is a prerequisite for implementing any effective change in this country; a progressive policy will definitely receive the firm support of the working class and the masses of the people.

The French Communist Party reiterates its willingness to support, both domestically and in parliament, a policy that takes into account the following national demands: freedom from foreign constraints, rejection of any form of armed militaristic Germany, talks with all countries, recognition of the rights and aspirations of colonial peoples, satisfaction of the urgent economic demands of the working class and all working people, and effective protection of democratic freedoms.

On the basis of the united front of the working class, the effective unity of all democratic and national forces can and will guarantee the victory of this policy.

    法国共产党政治局就内阁危机发表声明
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社巴黎六日讯：法国共产党政治局就内阁危机发表声明。声明指出：共产党议员们所以在孟戴斯—弗朗斯就任职务时投票赞成他，是因为他当时主张结束印度支那战争。但是后来他立刻采取了武装西德的政策，走上了对于工人阶级、工人阶级的要求和愿望采取敌对行动的道路。他像他的前任者一样，充当执行美英帝国主义者的侵略政策的大资本家的走狗。他听从他们的要求，支持利用巴黎协定来武装德国的作法，并且使国民议会批准巴黎协定。
    政治局声明接着指出，法国资产阶级企图把那些将执行同样政策的人弄到政府中去，这样来解决这次内阁危机。可是这次内阁危机又一次强调说明了愈来愈得到法国人支持的两种基本见解：改变外交政策是在这个国家实行任何有效的变革的先决条件；进步的政策一定会得到工人阶级和人民群众的坚决支持。
    法国共产党重申愿意在国内和议会中支持一种将考虑到以下各种民族要求的政策：不受外国的约束，拒绝任何形式的武装军国主义德国的措施，同一切国家进行会谈，承认殖民地人民的权利和愿望，满足工人阶级和全体劳动人民的迫切的经济要求，以及有效地保护民主自由。
    在工人阶级统一战线的基础上，一切民主的和民族的力量有效地团结起来，就能够并且一定会保证这种政策取得胜利。
