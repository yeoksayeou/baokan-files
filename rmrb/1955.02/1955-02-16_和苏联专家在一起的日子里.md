    The Days Spent with Soviet Experts
    Member of the Survey Team of the State-owned Friendship Farm, Li Heyan (oral account)
    The news that a large-scale grain farm, aided by the Soviet Union, would be built on the Sandaogang Grassland east of Jiamusi was published in the newspaper. At that time, our survey team had just finished its fieldwork in this area and was preparing to return to Harbin for study. Upon seeing this news, the young men (most of our survey team members were around twenty years old) were filled with new hope and elected two comrades to send a telegram from Fulitun to the leaders of the organization, requesting to participate in the construction of the large-scale grain farm. When the two representatives returned from Fulitun, everyone surrounded them. When they told everyone the good news, that the request had been approved, many people jumped up and sang. Some thought: It is my happiness to be able to work with Soviet experts who possess advanced scientific theoretical standards and rich experience, and with their personal assistance. Others thought: It is an honor of a lifetime to be able to personally participate in the construction of the first modern large-scale grain farm in the motherland. A young man in our team named Liao Diwu, whose home was in Hunan Province, hadn't been home for three or four years. His wife had written to him many times hoping he would come home for a visit. Several months earlier, he had saved some money and planned to take leave to go home after this fieldwork was completed. Now, he changed his original plan, sent the money home, and wrote to his wife telling her that he was participating in the construction of the large-scale farm and would not be coming home.

    Unexpectedly, so soon after the Soviet government delegation, headed by Comrade Khrushchev, returned to Moscow, the Soviet experts sent by the Soviet government to assist the Friendship Farm in land reclamation work arrived in Xinglong Town. Later, I heard that when the Soviet experts arrived in Beijing from Moscow, the Chinese comrades advised them to rest for a few days, but the Soviet experts refused. They said, "Time is everything!" The Soviet experts rushed to the site for days, and as soon as they arrived in Xinglong Town, they immediately began their intense work: holding seminars, listening to local comrades introduce the situation, and at dawn on the third day, the Soviet experts braved the cold and went from Xinglong Town to the wilderness for the first inspection.

    My specific job was to assist the Soviet land reclamation expert, Comrade Rasken, in surveying work. Rasken was in his fifties, of stout build with a kind face, and an old expert with more than twenty years of land reclamation experience. On the first day of work, he cared for us like an old father. He affectionately touched our cotton trousers and cotton jackets, asking us if we were cold, and instructing us to wear warmer clothes when working in the wilderness. He enthusiastically taught us Russian, such as the Russian names for instruments like the theodolite and the marker stakes. When we met old farmers who came to watch the excitement in the wilderness, he shook hands with the old farmers as warmly as if he had met old friends and greeted them. To be honest, I had never met a Soviet expert before, and I always felt a little restrained in my heart when I first met the expert. The facts educated me, and the unfamiliarity and small amount of worry between me and the expert quickly disappeared.

    Every day, at the break of dawn, we set off for the wilderness. At noon, the Soviet expert ate a few pieces of cold bread like everyone else and worked all day in the harsh cold wind. Except for this short time to eat bread, the old expert (that’s what we all called Comrade Rasken) was always walking non-stop. He was a bit stout, and wearing a bulky leather coat made it a little inconvenient for him to walk. Sometimes he really walked until he was panting, and we advised him to sit in the car and rest for a while, but he always refused. He said, "I'm still young, I don't feel tired, I don't need to rest!"

    He not only did it himself, but also explained it to us anytime and anywhere. From how to use a steel tape, how to bury marker stakes, find perspective, and select points, to the more technically complex leveling, he would first explain the principles and working methods clearly. He would explain how to do the first step, how to do the second step, and then do a demonstration himself, so we could learn by following along. If we didn't understand the first time he explained it, the expert would explain it again; if the words didn't get through, the expert would use drawings to illustrate it. For example, when planting marker stakes, the old expert told us in detail how to use the theodolite, how to select the location to bury the stake, how to dig the pit, how to bury it, and how deep to bury it. Then, he personally buried the first stake. When burying the second stake, he didn't say anything, but watched you bury it well. He carefully checked it and, if he was satisfied with what you did, he smiled so happily and said, "Good." How much warmth and encouragement the old expert's smile gave us!

    The Soviet expert was happy for every small step forward and achievement we made. When he saw our negligence or mistakes in our work, he criticized us very frankly. Once, when measuring a guide line at the headquarters, expert Khasov led several people to measure from the opposite side, and the old expert led us to measure towards them. When the two sides met, there was a difference of 2.3 meters. After several checks, it turned out that we had made a mistake in the number of a stake. The old expert said to us very seriously, "As an old surveyor, I advise you that surveying cannot be done without meticulousness. No matter what you can do, no matter how much theory you know, no matter how rich your experience is, if you are not meticulous, you cannot do a good job."

    In just two months, the Soviet experts taught us systematically and specifically according to the advanced technical requirements of the Soviet Union, enabling us to fully learn all the skills from ordinary to more complex surveying work.

    What I will never forget is that day, December 22nd last year. On this day, a rare strong wind blew across the grassland. The snow and sand, stirred up by the wind, covered the grassland like a mist, and the sky and ground were a vast expanse of white. Each group of our land survey team went to work in the wilderness as usual. As soon as we got out of the car, the headwind made it hard to breathe. We had to walk sideways or turn our backs and walk backwards. The measuring rod, when erected, was blown down by the wind at once, and we erected it again. On this day, we were conducting horizontal leveling at the general farm headquarters. Horizontal leveling is a relatively complex task that requires the simultaneous establishment of twenty distance points. The old expert walked back and forth non-stop, directing everyone to carry out the work. The young translator followed him closely, and he enthusiastically told her how to walk when facing the wind and how to walk when the wind was at your back. He also encouraged everyone, "Today the wind is strong, and tomorrow it may be even stronger. We surveyors must learn to work in strong winds. What's wrong with the steel tape moving in the wind? We step on it firmly and measure the numbers. If the measuring flag is far away and we can't see it clearly, we move it closer. In this way, we can work in strong winds and still meet the accuracy requirements."

    It was really cold that day. After standing still for a while, the two feet felt as if they were standing naked in cold water. You had to step on your feet quickly, or run a few laps, and then continue working after your feet were warm. The wind blowing on the face felt like a knife cut. The old expert's face was flushed and a little purple. Someone noticed that the tip of the old expert's nose was frozen white (when the tip of the nose freezes, it turns white), and quickly told him. The old expert grabbed a handful of snow and gently rubbed the tip of his nose. He smiled, as if he didn't feel the cold. What he cared about was work, was others. He constantly looked at other people's faces, and he cared about whose nose was frozen; after a while, he ran to the migrant workers who were holding the measuring rod, he wanted to hold the measuring rod for the migrant workers and let them move their legs and feet. ...

    In the strong wind, in times of difficult work, the old expert still never forgot to help us learn technology. He insisted on letting me observe in front of the level, he took off his gloves and helped me record the field notes with his bare hands. The pencil fell from the old expert's frozen hand, he breathed on his hand and continued to write. The old expert also raised a hand with a large glove from time to time to block the wind for my eyes, so that I could see more conveniently and clearly. I found that every time the level was moved, the old expert always consciously stood on the upwind side, using his stout body to block the wind for me! Immediately, a warm feeling spread throughout my body, I thought: "I don't know how to thank the old expert, I want to work better!" At this time, I seemed to feel that the sky was not so cold, and the wind seemed to have weakened.

    That night, I lay in bed, and the old expert's kind and amiable face was still present before my eyes. I thought: I have seen the Soviet people with my own eyes, I truly understand what internationalism is ... (Reported by Li Wen, reporter of this newspaper)

    和苏联专家在一起的日子里
    国营友谊农场勘测队队员  黎和焱（口述）
    苏联帮助我国建设的大型谷物农场，将在佳木斯以东三道岗草原上建场的消息，在报纸上公布了，这时，我们勘测队正在这一带刚刚结束了野外测量工作，正准备回哈尔滨学习。看到这个消息，小伙子们（我们勘测队员大都是二十岁上下的青年）都燃起了一个新的希望，便推选了两个同志去福利屯打电报，向机关首长要求参加大型谷物农场的建场工作。两位代表从福利屯回来，大家一下子把他们围起来，当他俩把喜讯告诉给大家：要求已批准了。不少人高兴地跳起来，唱起来。有人想：能跟具有先进的科学理论水准、又有丰富经验的苏联专家一起，在他亲自帮助下工作，是自己的幸福，有人想：能亲自参加祖国第一个最近代化的大型谷物农场的建场工作，是自己一生的荣幸。我们队里有个叫廖涤吾的青年，家在湖南省，三、四年没回家了，他妻子曾多次来信盼他回家看看，早在几个月前，他曾积蓄些钱，准备这次野外工作结束后，请假回家。现在，他改变了原来的打算，把钱寄给家里，写信告诉妻子，他参加大型农场的建场工作，不回家了。
    没想到这样快，以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联政府代表团刚回到莫斯科，苏联政府派来帮助友谊农场进行土地整理工作的苏联专家，便来到了兴隆镇。后来我听说：苏联专家从莫斯科远程到达北京的时候，中国同志劝专家稍许休息几天，苏联专家不肯，他们提出来：“时间就是一切啊！”苏联专家连日赶来现场，刚到兴隆镇，便立刻开始了紧张的工作；开座谈会，听当地同志介绍情况，第三天拂晓，苏联专家便冒着寒冷，从兴隆镇前往荒原进行了第一次的察看。
    我的具体工作是帮助苏联土地整理专家拉斯肯同志进行测量工作。拉斯肯五十多岁，胖胖的个子，一副慈祥的面孔，是一位有二十多年土地整理工作经验的老专家。工作的第一天，他便像老爸爸似地关照我们，他亲切地摸一摸我们的棉裤、棉袄，问我们冷不冷，嘱咐我们下荒地工作一定要穿得暖一些。他热心地教我们学俄文，像经纬仪啦，标桩啦等用具的俄文名字。在荒地上遇见了来看热闹的老农民，他像见到老朋友一样亲热地和老农民握手，向他问好。说实在的，我过去没有见过苏联专家，初见专家心里总有点拘束，事实教育了我，和专家之间的生疏和很小的一点顾虑，也很快便消失了。
    每天，天曚曚亮，我们便出发到荒地了，中午，苏联专家和大家一样吃上几块凉面包，在凛冽的寒风中工作一个整天。除了吃面包这么一会儿，老专家（我们都这样称呼拉斯肯同志）总是不停脚地走。他身体胖些，穿上臃肿的皮大衣，走起路来不大方便，有时真走得有些发喘了，我们劝他坐汽车上，休息一会，他每次总是不肯，他说：“我还年轻，不觉累，用不着休息啊！”
    他不仅亲自动手做，还随时随地向我们讲解。从怎样使用钢尺，怎样埋标桩、找透视、选点，到技术复杂些的测量水准等，都是先把原理和工作方法讲清楚，第一步如何做，第二步如何做，亲自做个样子，让我们照着学。如果讲第一次我们没听懂，专家再讲一次；话说不通了，专家就画图来说明。比如栽标桩吧，老专家详细告诉我们怎样使用经纬仪，选定埋桩的位置，怎样挖坑，怎样埋，埋多深，然后，他亲自动手埋好第一根桩。埋第二根桩时，他就不说话了，看着你把它埋好，他仔细检查一遍，对你做的感到满意，他是那样高兴地笑了，说一句：“好”，老专家的笑给我们多么大的温暖和鼓励啊！
    苏联专家为我们每一个微小的进步和成绩高兴，当他看到我们工作中的疏忽或过错的时候，便很爽直地批评我们。有一次，在总场部测导线，哈索夫专家领着几个人从对面测过来，老专家领着我们迎面测过去，双方相遇的时候，差了二公尺三的数字，经过几次检查，原来我们把一棵桩的号码搞错了，老专家很严肃地对我们说：“我以一个老测量员的身份忠告你们：测量不能离开细致，不管你什么都会做，不管你知道多少理论，有多丰富的经验，离开细致，便不能做好工作。”
    短短的两个月，苏联专家按着苏联的先进技术要求，系统地具体地教我们，使我们完全学会了从普通的到能掌握较复杂的测量工作的全套本领。
    最使我难忘的，还是去年十二月二十二日那天。这天，草原上刮起了少有的大风，被风扬起来的雪沙，烟雾般地罩着草原，天上地下一片白茫茫。我们土地考察组各个小组照常到荒原工作。我们一下汽车，迎头风吹得人喘不过气来，我们只好斜着身子走，或背转身，倒退着走。测量用的塔尺竖起来，一下子便被风吹倒，我们再一次把它竖起来。这天，我们在总场场部进行水平测量。水平测量是比较复杂的工作，要同时设立二十个距离点，老专家不停地来回奔走着，指挥大家进行工作。年轻的翻译紧紧地跟在他后面，他热情地告诉她，迎风时要怎样走，顺风时怎样走。他还鼓励大家：“今天风大，明天说不定还会有风，我们测量人员要学会在大风中工作。风吹得钢尺乱动，这有什么呢，我们用脚踩紧它，再量出数字；测旗离得远，看不清楚，我们把它移得近一点，这样，又能在大风中工作，又达到精度要求。”
    这天真冷。稍许停立一会儿，两只脚就像赤裸着立在冷水里，要连忙踏踏脚，或者跑上几圈，脚热了再继续工作。风刮到脸上，像刀割似的。老专家冻得通红的脸有些发紫了。有人发现老专家的鼻尖冻得发白了（鼻尖冻僵时，泛白色），急忙告诉他，老专家抓起一把雪沙，轻轻地揉擦鼻尖，他微笑着，像没觉到寒冷似的。他关心的是工作，是别人。他不时地端详别人的脸，他关心又有那个人的鼻尖冻僵了；一会儿他又跑到掌拿塔尺的民工们跟前，他要替民工扶塔尺，让他们活动下腿脚。……
    在大风里，在工作困难的时候，老专家还是念念不忘地帮助我们学技术。他坚持让我在水平仪前观测，他脱掉手套，赤着手帮助我记野账。铅笔从老专家冻僵的手里掉下来，他用嘴呵下手，再继续写。老专家还不时地扬起一只带着大手套的手，为我的眼睛遮风，让我看得更方便些、清楚些。我发现每次搬动水平仪的时候，老专家总是有意识地站在上风头里，用他那胖大的身躯在为我挡风哩！立刻一种温暖的感觉传遍我的全身，我想：“我不知道该怎样感谢老专家，我要更好地工作！”这时，我似乎觉得天不是那么冷，风也像减弱了。
    这天晚上，我躺在床上，老专家那幅慈祥可亲的面孔，还一直呈现在我的眼前。我想：我亲眼看到了苏维埃人，我真正懂得了，国际主义精神是什么……（本报记者力文记）
