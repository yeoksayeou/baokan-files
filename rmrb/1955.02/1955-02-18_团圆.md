Item A-Tu, a soldier liberated from Yijiangshan Island, was lying on his bed feeling depressed, the scene of being captured by Chiang's bandit troops on Yijiangshan Island more than three years ago churning in his mind. It was May 1951, right in the middle of the yellow croaker season, and the yellow croakers in Maotou Ocean were abundant. Their fishing boat was returning from fishing in Maotou Ocean, loaded with nine thousand catties of yellow croaker, sailing joyfully on its way home. In the distance, the sound of a motor rang out, and the Kuomintang "guerrilla force" motor sailing boat trained by the American spy agency "Western Enterprises Corporation" appeared. Panic arose on the fishing boat, and they raised their sails, trying their best to escape. The wind and waves were high, and the sail cable broke. The American-made motor sailing boat quickly caught up with the fishing boat. Three people jumped over, took out pistols, and forced them to sail the fishing boat to Yijiangshan... "It's been almost four years since I came out, I don't know if my 74-year-old mother at home is still alive, and my son Shi-De should be eight years old this year. And a little daughter, who was only two months old when she was born, I don't know if she's dead or alive now. How can Shi-De's mother live alone? The murderous Chiang Kai-shek, the murderous Americans!" As Item A-Tu was lost in thought, his heart aching, Xie A-Gou, a young fisherman who had been captured with him, ran in shouting, "Brother A-Tu, Brother A-Tu, someone from your family has come." Item A-Tu was startled, quickly got up, and walked to the courtyard, where he saw a large group of people, noisy and clamorous, surrounding a woman in her thirties wearing a Haichang blue cloth shirt and embroidered cloth shoes, supporting a seven or eight-year-old child, followed by several ordinary people. It turned out that A-Tu's wife received a government notice and came with his son Shi-De, his elder brother Item Dao-Zheng, his brother-in-law Jin Dao-Mao, and his younger brother-in-law Li Ming-Fu to take him home. Item A-Tu was stunned for a moment. His elder brother stepped forward and grabbed his hand: "A-Tu, A-Tu, we've come." His brother-in-law and his younger brother-in-law also crowded around. A-Tu's wife lowered her head, nudging Shi-De to call "Dad," but Shi-De held tightly to the corner of his mother's clothes and wouldn't let go.

Seeing that his son was already half his height, Item A-Tu couldn't help but feel both happy and sad.

"Is everyone at home well?" he asked hesitantly.

"Everyone is well, Mom is also healthy, and she wanted to come see you, but she had to stay home to take care of Xian-E, and couldn't get away," A-Tu's wife replied softly.

"Who is Xian-E?" Item A-Tu asked strangely.

"It's the little girl who was born the year you were captured, she's four years old this year." A-Tu's wife was a little surprised that her husband couldn't even remember his own family.

"Luckily, the family was allocated three mu of land, joined the mutual aid group, and planted both cotton and rice, with a harvest every year. The government took care of us and provided relief four times, with both food and money, which is how we managed to raise the children one by one," A-Tu's wife said chattily. Item A-Tu was busy asking his brother, brother-in-law, and younger brother-in-law to sit inside the house, and took out the cigarettes that had been distributed to entertain everyone. His younger brother-in-law Li Ming-Fu couldn't be bothered to sit down, and impatiently inquired, "What happened to Ye Rong-He?" Ye Rong-He was a fisherman who had been captured on the same boat as Item A-Tu, and was Li Ming-Fu's maternal uncle. After he was captured, his old mother cried and rolled around on the ground. This time, when Li Ming-Fu came to see Item A-Tu, his mother-in-law repeatedly told him to find out what had happened to him.

"Ye Rong-He is also here, and was liberated with me."

"Really?" his younger brother-in-law asked anxiously.

"Of course it's true, I even saw him at a meeting yesterday."

His younger brother-in-law didn't go into the house, and immediately walked out. He rushed home that night to tell his old mother-in-law the good news.

Shi-De gradually became familiar with his father, and stayed with his father that night. Many of the liberated soldiers happily gathered around them to watch.

"What do you eat at home? Do you miss Dad?" Item A-Tu asked, hugging his son and kissing him inside the quilt.

"Mom cries whenever she misses Dad, she cries when she sees people going out to fish, and she cries when she sees people coming back from fishing. I also miss Dad, and I even dream that Dad has come back. At home, we eat two meals a day, one meal of sweet potato shreds. Mom says that when Dad comes back and catches fish, we'll have rice for every meal, and even meat!" The child's words made everyone laugh.

"Ah, my family, my family..." Yu Chang-Hua, who was sleeping in the corner, was also a fisherman who had been captured by Chiang's bandit troops, and he was sighing with tears streaming down his face. His sixteen-year-old son Yu Bao-Fa, who had been captured with him, silently lowered his head. Xie A-Gou quickly sat down to comfort him: "Your family will definitely come to see you safe and sound."

"No, no, my family is old and young, a family of seven or eight people, all relying on me and Bao-Fa to survive. We were captured together for three or four years, and the family must have either starved to death or broken up." Yu Chang-Hua said, coughing rapidly.

At this moment, forty-one-year-old Aunt Chang-Hua, holding an old umbrella, was happily and laboriously rushing along the road in the rain. Three years ago, her forty-five-year-old husband Yu Chang-Hua and thirteen-year-old son Yu Bao-Fa rowed a sampan together from Wenling to Shenjiamen, and there was no news of them since. The weather was calm in those days, and the sampan wouldn't have capsized, so everyone said that they had been captured by the Kuomintang bandits. The remaining seventy-two-year-old mother, fifteen-year-old and seven-year-old daughters, and five-year-old and three-year-old sons cried as if they were dying. Aunt Chang-Hua seemed to have aged ten years at once. Later, she and her two daughters weaved fishing nets to survive, and the government often provided relief to her family. Around the Lunar New Year this year, they sent 180,000 yuan to let her family buy some food for the New Year. On the first, second, and third days of the Lunar New Year, the fishermen all went home to eat reunion dinners, and Aunt Chang-Hua couldn't help but shed tears when she thought of her husband and son. She didn't dare to cry loudly, for fear of upsetting her mother-in-law. The old mother still started crying first, and the daughters and sons followed suit. The whole family cried together again. Who would have thought that the village chief would come running happily, shouting, "Chang-Hua has news, Bao-Fa has news, the People's Liberation Army has liberated Yijiangshan, and they've all been liberated!" The whole family was so happy that they didn't sleep well all night. At the break of dawn, Aunt Chang-Hua braved the rain and set out on the road, walking eighty li to Wenling County.

Here, she met sixty-year-old Aunt Zhang, who was also going to pick up her son Zhang A-Mei. They traveled together, taking a boat and then a car from Wenling. On the car, they also met Huang Chuan-Bao's father, Huang Gen-He, and Chi Gen-Lin's young wife, Wang Dong-Hua, who were all going to welcome their sons and husbands who had been liberated from Yijiangshan.

"Huang Chuan-Bao, Huang Chuan-Bao," "Chi Gen-Lin," "Chi Gen-Lin, your family has come!" Huang Chuan-Bao darted out like an arrow, and Chi Gen-Lin, his shoelaces untied, also ran out after him.

"Dad, Dad!" Twenty-two-year-old Huang Chuan-Bao couldn't help but cry like a child when he saw his father. Sister-in-law Gen-Lin walked up and grabbed Gen-Lin, sobbing incessantly.

"Yu Chang-Hua, Yu Chang-Hua, your family has come!" "Yu Bao-Fa, Yu Bao-Fa, your mother has come!" The courtyard was filled with voices, and people were running and shouting everywhere.

Aunt Chang-Hua, wearing a blue cloth fishing skirt and a blue cloth headscarf, held an umbrella in one hand and grabbed her son's hand with the other, tears dripping uncontrollably onto her son's hand.

The old fisherman Yu Chang-Hua stood there blankly, asking in a trembling voice, "You, how did you come? How is the family?"

"All is well, all is well, the whole family is safe," Aunt Chang-Hua replied quickly, "Thanks to the People's Government for providing relief so many times. The whole family, old and young, is safe."

"All safe?" The old man Yu Chang-Hua was stunned to hear this. For many days, he had been worried about his family, thinking that his family was finished.

"Good, good!" he suddenly shouted repeatedly, tears streaming down the wrinkles on his face: "The bandits on Yijiangshan said that the people on the mainland were all eating turn-over flour (rice bran) and tree bark. I thought that my family only had five fen of land, enough for the whole family to eat for only one month. The whole family would either starve to death or break up. I thought that my son and daughter had already been given away, and I thought that my old mother had already gone begging for food. Good, good, the People's Liberation Army saved my son and my lives, and the People's Government saved my whole family!"

The knot in his brow loosened, and he happily took the towel, soap, cigarettes, toothpaste, and toothbrush issued by the People's Liberation Army and showed them to his wife one by one, and insisted on taking out cigarettes to offer to the working comrades who had sent his wife.

Aunt Chang-Hua kept stroking her son's head and his clothes, while trying hard to suppress her tears: "I thought I would never see you again in this lifetime."

"Where? Where?" Old man Yu Chang-Hua seemed to have become younger all of a sudden, the wrinkles on his face smoothed out, and the tone of his voice became clear: "I was planning to return to my hometown day and night. I thought that my old bones would eventually be buried in the soil of my hometown. In these three years, my body was in Yijiang, but my heart was on the mainland. Every night I dreamed of returning home, fishing and rowing a small boat, and when I woke up, I was still in Yijiang, and I don't know how many tears I shed. The suffering of these three years cannot be described in three days and three nights. Bao-Fa and I were captured to that isolated island. We couldn't see the sky above, and we couldn't reach the ground below. There was no food to eat, we ate bean cakes, but we couldn't even get bean cakes. There were no quilts to cover ourselves with, we covered ourselves with sacks, but the sacks couldn't keep us warm. There were no clothes to wear, we went around naked. I was old and my waist and legs were not flexible, so they asked me to be a cook, and Bao-Fa became a messenger and orderly. Later, they gave us half-sleeved 'tiger skins' to put on, dressed us up and sent us to Dachen. They gave us American guns and American cannons. The Americans came to see us stand at attention and stand at ease, and taught us to pick up rifles and charge on the beach. Later, they押 (yā,press) us back to Yijiang. Those Kuomintang bastards even told us every day to 'counterattack, counterattack to the mainland to save our parents and wives.' I cursed secretly in my heart: 'You are the ones who broke up my good family of parents and wives, and you're still talking nonsense.'" When the People's Liberation Army bombarded Yijiang, I was both happy and scared in my heart. I was happy that I could go home after Yijiang was liberated. I was scared that the cannons were firing so fiercely that they turned over all the soil of Yijiangshan.

"On the day Yijiangshan was liberated, as soon as the planes came and dropped bombs, I quickly hid in a single-person air-raid shelter. I only heard the sound of cannons getting tighter and tighter. Later, the sound of gunfire rang out, and I heard people outside saying, 'Move faster! Move faster!' I knew that the People's Liberation Army had landed, and I hurried out. When I got here, I met Bao-Fa again. The People's Liberation Army saved the lives of both my son and me."

At this moment, Li Yun-Cai's eighty-four-year-old father Li Dao-Sheng, leading Yun-Cai's wife and two pairs of grandchildren, came to take his son home. The four children, one next to the other, supported their great-grandfather as they came in. Li Yun-Cai hurriedly went out to meet them, called out "Dad," and couldn't say anything more.

The liberated officers and soldiers in the courtyard all gathered around, smiling at the scene of the families reuniting. One said, "The People's Liberation Army saved so many people's lives!" Another said, "If it hadn't been for liberation, these families would have cried to death." Yet another murmured to himself, "The letter I sent home should have arrived in the last couple of days!"

Before the words had finished, another old man, bent over and hunchbacked, walked in tremblingly. He was Li Ke-Qiang's seventy-four-year-old father, who had just come from twenty li away. The old man didn't recognize his son when he saw him. Li Ke-Qiang had been taken away five or six years ago, and had suffered all kinds of hardships outside. A man of twenty-nine looked like he was over forty. The old father didn't recognize his son, and took his son's hand, trembling, and said, "Please do a good deed and help me find my son. It's a pity that my family has been single for six generations, and he's the only one!" Li Ke-Qiang barely held back his tears, calling out sadly, "Dad, Dad, I'm your son Ke-Qiang! The People's Liberation Army rescued me and brought me back!"

"Chiang Kai-shek, the traitor, and the American devils have really harmed so many people!" everyone in the courtyard said, gnashing their teeth.

    团圆
    本报记者　金凤
    一江山解放过来的士兵项阿土在铺上躺着发闷，三年多以前被蒋贼军抓到一江山的情景在他脑中翻腾着。一九五一年的五月，正是黄鱼汛期，猫头洋的黄鱼丰收。他们的渔船在猫头洋捕鱼归来，载足了九千斤的黄鱼，欢快地在回家的路上航行着。远远地，马达声音响了，美国特务机关“西方企业公司”训练的国民党“游击部队”的机帆船出现了。渔船上惊恐起来，扯足了篷，尽力想脱逃出去。风大浪高，篷索断了。美国造的机帆船马上追上了渔船。跳过三个人来，拿出手枪，逼着他们把渔船开到一江山去……“一出来就快四年，家里七十四岁的老母不知还活不活，儿子士德今年该有八岁了。还有一个小女儿，那时才生下两个月，现在也不知是死是活。士德他妈一个女人如何过活呢？害死人的蒋介石，害死人的美国佬呀！”项阿土正想得出神，心酸，和他一起被抓去的青年渔民谢阿狗连跑带跳地嚷进来：“阿土哥，阿土哥，你家里来了人了。”项阿土吃了一惊，连忙爬起来，走到院子里，只见一大群人，闹闹嚷嚷，拥着一个三十来岁穿海昌蓝布衫、绣花布鞋的妇女，搀着一个七、八岁的小孩，后面还跟着几个老百姓。原来阿土嫂接到政府通知，带着他儿子士德，和他大哥项道正、姊夫金道茂、小舅李明富一起赶来接他回家了。项阿土一时呆住了。他大哥一步跨上前，拉住他的手：“阿土，阿土，我们来了。”他姊夫、他小舅也都围上前来。阿土嫂低头推着士德叫爸爸，士德却死命拉住母亲的衣角不放。
    项阿土一见他儿子长得有他半身高了，禁不住又欢喜又伤心。
    “家中人口都好？”他有些口吃地问。
    “都好，娘身体也健朗，还想来看你，就是要在家带仙娥，不得脱身。”阿土嫂轻轻地回答。
    “仙娥是谁？”项阿土有些奇怪地问。
      “就是你抓走那年生的小丫头，今年可有四岁啦。”阿土嫂有些见怪她丈夫连家里人都记不清。
       “家里幸亏分了三亩地，参加了互助组，又种棉花又种稻的，年年都有收成。政府照顾，还救济了四次，又是粮食又是钱的，这才把孩子一个个拉扯大了。”阿土嫂一路絮絮地说着。项阿土忙着让哥哥、姊夫、小舅屋里坐，又拿出发下来的香烟招待大家。小舅李明富却顾不得坐，性急地打听：“叶荣和怎么样了？”叶荣和是和项阿土一船被抓去的渔民，是李明富的小舅。被抓去以后，他老母亲哭得在地上滚来滚去。这次李明富来看项阿土时，他岳母娘千叮嘱万叮嘱，叫他一定打听清楚。
    “叶荣和也在这里，和我一起解放的。”
    “是真的？”他小舅急急地问。
     “自然是真的，昨天开会还见了面的。”
    他小舅不往屋里坐了，拔脚往外就走。他连夜赶回家去给他老岳母报喜讯去了。
    士德也渐渐和爸爸搞熟了，晚上就和爸爸住在一起。许多解放过来的士兵高高兴兴地围着他们看。
      “在家里吃些什么？想不想爸爸？”项阿土抱着儿子，坐在被里亲着他问。
      “妈妈想爸爸老是哭，看到人家出去打鱼就哭，看到人家打鱼回来也哭。我也想爸爸，还做梦爸爸回来了。家里每天两餐吃饭，一餐吃番薯丝。妈妈说爸爸回来捕了鱼，就餐餐吃饭，还有肉吃呢。”孩子的话逗得大家都笑起来。
      “唉，我的一家，我的一家……”屋角睡着的余长华，也是被蒋贼军抓去的渔民，他在流着泪叹着气。和他一起被抓去的十六岁的儿子余保法默默地低着头。谢阿狗连忙坐过去安慰他：“你家里人一定也会平平安安来看你的。”
      “不，不，我家里老的老，小的小，一家七、八口人，全靠我和保法过活。我们一起抓去三、四年，家里不饿死也拆散了。”余长华一面说，一面急剧地咳嗽着。
    这时候，四十一岁的长华婶撑着一把旧雨伞，正在雨下又高兴又辛苦地赶着路。三年以前，她的四十五岁的丈夫余长华和十三岁的儿子余保法一起摇了一只舢板，从温岭到沈家门，从此没有消息。那几天风平浪静，舢板不会打翻，都说他父子俩是被国民党那一帮土匪捉去了。家里剩下七十二岁的老母亲，十五岁和七岁的两个女儿，五岁，三岁的两个儿子，哭得死去活来。长华婶一下子仿佛老了十年。以后就靠她和两个女儿织渔网，政府又时常救济她家。今年过年前后送来十八万元，让她家买点粮食过年。初一、初二、初三，家家打鱼的人都回家过年吃团圆饭，长华婶想起丈夫，想起儿子，忍不住悄悄流泪。她不敢大声哭出来，怕惹得老婆母伤心。老母亲还是先哭起来了，女儿和儿子也跟着哭。一家又哭成一团。谁料想村长喜冲冲的跑来叫着：“长华有信了，保法有信了，解放军解放了一江山，把他们都解放回来了！”全家高兴得一夜没有睡好。赶天一亮，长华婶冒着雨就上了路，走八十里路赶到温岭县。
    在这里她遇到了六十岁的章家阿姆，也是去接她儿子章阿美回家的。她们一路作了伴，从温岭坐船，又坐了车。在车上她们又碰到黄传宝的父亲黄根和，池根林的年轻的妻子王东花，都是赶去迎接他们从一江山解放回来的儿子和丈夫回家的。
      “黄传宝，黄传宝”，“池根林”，“池根林，你们家里来人了！”黄传宝像箭似地直窜出来，池根林的鞋带没有结好，也跟着就奔出来。
    “爸爸，爸爸！”二十二岁的黄传宝见了父亲，忍不住像孩子般哭起来。根林嫂走上来拉住根林也抽抽噎噎地哭个不住。
      “余长华，余长华，你家里也来人了！”“余保法，余保法，你妈妈来了！”院子里一片人声，到处都有人在跑着，叫着。
    围着蓝布渔裙、包着蓝布头巾的长华婶一手拿着雨伞，一手抓住儿子的手，眼泪止不住地滴在儿子手上。
    老渔民余长华呆呆地立在那里，颤声问着：“你，你怎么来的？家里怎样了？”
    “全好，全好，一家老小都保住了。”长华婶连忙回答，“多亏了人民政府救济了多少次。全家老老小小都保住了。”
    “都保住了？”老头子余长华听得发呆了。多少天来他担心着家里，以为一家是完了。
      “好，好！”他忽然连声叫着，泪顺着他脸上的一条条纵横的皱纹直流下来：“一江山的土匪说大陆上的老百姓都吃翻身粉（米糠），吃树皮。我思忖我家只有五分地，只够全家吃一个月的。一家老小不饿死也拆散了。我思忖儿子、女儿早送了人，我思忖老母亲早去讨吃了。好，好，解放军救了我父子的性命，人民政府又救了我一家的性命！”
    他眉心的疙瘩解开了，高高兴兴地拿着解放军发给他的毛巾、肥皂、香烟、牙膏、牙刷……一样样拿给妻子看，又一定要拿出香烟来请送他妻子来的工作同志吃。
    长华婶不住抚摸着儿子的头，摸着儿子的衣服，一边用力抑制着眼泪：“我只当是这一世再也不能见面了。”
    “哪里？哪里？”余长华老头一下子仿佛年轻起来，他脸上的皱纹都舒展开来，说话的嗓音也清亮了：“我可是日夜盘算着回家乡。我思忖着我这把老骨头总要埋在家乡的土上。这三年，我人在一江，心在大陆。夜夜做梦回到屋里，又是捕鱼，又是摇小船，一醒过来，还在一江，眼泪不知流了多少。这三年的苦，是三天三夜也说不完的。我和保法被抓到那孤岛上。上不见天，下不着地。没有饭吃，吃豆饼，豆饼也吃不到。没有被盖，盖麻袋，麻袋也盖不住。没有衣穿，打赤膊。我年纪大，腰腿不便，叫我当伙伕，保法当了传令兵兼勤务兵。后来又发下半截袖的‘老虎皮’，叫我们披了，把我们装到大陈。发给我们美国枪、美国炮。美国人来看我们做立正、稍息，教我们拿起步枪往滩头上冲。后来又把我们押回一江。那些国民党坏蛋，还天天对我们说什么“反攻，反攻到大陆去救父母妻子”。我心里暗暗咒骂：“就是你们把我好好一家父母妻子拆散了，还讲什么鬼话。”解放军炮打一江，我心里又欢喜又害怕。欢喜的是解放了一江就可以回家了。害怕的是大炮打得实在厉害，把一江山的土都翻过来了。
    “解放一江山那天，飞机一来丢炸弹，我就赶紧躲在一个单人防空洞里。只听炮声愈打愈紧。以后枪声响了，又听到外面说：‘走快！走快！’我晓得解放军登陆了，赶忙走了出来。到了这里又碰到保法。解放军把我们父子两人的命都救出来了。”
    这时候，外面又走进李允才的八十四岁的老父亲李道盛，带着允才婶和两双孙儿女，赶来接儿子回家。四个孩子长得一个挨一个的，搀着老祖父进来。李允才忙迎出去，叫了一声“爹”就说不出话来了。
    院子里的解放过来的官兵们都围拢来，笑容满面地看看这一家家老小团圆的场面。一个说：“解放军救了多少人的性命！”一个说：“要不解放，这一家家哭都哭死了。”还有一个自言自语地计算着：“我打回家的信这两天也该收到了！”
    话没有落音，又一个老头子弯着腰，驼着背，颤巍巍地走了进来。他是李克强的七十四岁的父亲，才从二十里外赶了来。老人见到儿子，不认识儿子了。李克强被拉走五、六年，在外面吃尽辛苦，二十九岁的人，看来倒像有四十开外。老父亲认不出儿子，拉着儿子的手抖索索地说：“求你做做好事，帮我找一找我那儿子。可怜我家六代单丁，就他一个人呀！”儿子李克强好容易忍住眼泪，凄凄惶惶地叫着：“爹，爹，我就是你儿子克强呀！解放军救了我回来了！”
     “蒋介石卖国贼和美国鬼子，真是害煞了多少人呀！”院子中的人一个个咬牙切齿地说。
