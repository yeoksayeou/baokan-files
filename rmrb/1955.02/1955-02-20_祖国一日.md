A Day in the Motherland

    Recently, the editorial department of this newspaper has continuously received many photographs taken by photographers from all over the country on February 4th (Start of Spring) for this publication.

    These photographs depict various aspects of activity in our motherland in a single day: grand socialist construction is underway on our vast territory. (See picture)

    Right picture: Beijing – the heart of the motherland. In the early morning, the sunshine of early spring shines on this ancient yet young city. On Chang'an Avenue, which runs east-west across Tiananmen Square, staff of state organs, workers, and students are rushing to their posts, beginning a day of work and study.

    The key projects of our country's First Five-Year Plan, which have already started construction, will enter the most intense construction phase this year, and most of those that have not yet started construction will complete preparatory work this year. While vigorously developing heavy industry, light industry and transportation have also seen corresponding development.

    Right picture: The large amount of steel produced by our motherland every day provides endless raw materials for the development of the machinery manufacturing industry. This is the No. 2 furnace of Daye Steel Plant tapping steel.

People will soon be able to see trains from Beijing pass through this bridge and reach Guangzhou directly. This is the bustling Han River Highway Bridge construction site, a component of the Yangtze River Bridge.

    With the progress of national industrialization, agricultural production and the socialist transformation of agriculture will inevitably have greater development. After the Start of Spring, large-scale spring plowing and sowing will begin in our country's vast rural areas.

    On the basis of continuous development in production, the material and cultural living standards of the working people across the country have been correspondingly improved.
