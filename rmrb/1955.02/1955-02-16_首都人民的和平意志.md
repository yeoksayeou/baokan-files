The Peaceful Will of the People of the Capital
    Our staff reporter
    As the clouds of atomic war increasingly threaten the peaceful life of humanity, the people of Beijing, the capital of our great motherland, together with the people of the whole country and the world, have launched a magnificent and powerful signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons. This movement is a great review of the forces of the people defending peace, and the people will inevitably be able to further enhance their confidence in defending peace through this movement.
    February 14th was the first day of the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons by the people of Beijing. As in previous undertakings to defend peace, the working class of Beijing stood at the forefront of the movement. Early in the morning of the 14th, the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons began in various factories, mines and construction sites. Many factory workshops displayed huge slogans, big-character posters and cartoons against the use of atomic weapons. Many blackboard newspapers also changed to new content. Workers, technicians, and staff solemnly read the "Appeal to the People of the World" by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council next to their machines and at their work posts, and signed their names. At the signature campaign against atomic weapons held by the First Automobile Accessories Factory, all 1,582 employees present signed their names, and after signing, they applauded warmly and sang the song "People of the World, One Heart," expressing their will to oppose the use of atomic weapons. On the 14th, the workshops, canteens, and public places of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant were crowded with workers and their families signing their names. Thirteen rotating workers from the coal washing plant, after hearing the news that the workers were holding a signature rally against the use of atomic weapons, also rushed to the factory to sign their names. The signature campaign made people think of the two routes for the use of atomic energy in the world. Hou Decheng, a model worker of Beijing and a worker at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, said when signing his name: "The Soviet Union uses atomic energy to generate electricity and benefit mankind, but American imperialism wants to use atomic energy to launch wars and destroy mankind on a large scale! We must use practical actions to comprehensively overfulfill the February production tasks to oppose the use of atomic weapons and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan!" The employees of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory signed their names at a meeting on the afternoon of the 15th, with 3,281 employees signing. Liu Lu, an old worker of this factory who had participated in the "February 7th" Great Strike, said when signing his name: "I have experienced countless wars in my life and seen countless martyrs shed blood and sacrifice for the cause of revolution. Today, our peaceful and happy life was bought with the blood of the martyrs, and we will never allow anyone to destroy it! I am the foreman of the freight car workshop in our factory, and my son is also a lathe worker in the factory. My son and I, together with all the workers in the factory, must do a good job in production and strive to produce more freight cars to support the liberation of Taiwan." Zhang Zhengang, the compression foreman of the power workshop of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, was captured by Japanese imperialism and sent to Japan to work as a laborer when Japanese imperialism invaded China. He had heard people talk about the tragic situation of the people of Hiroshima, Japan, being bombed by American atomic bombs, and he had also personally seen the situation of Hiroshima after it was restored by the Japanese people. The facts he heard and witnessed made him understand even more that the use of atomic weapons must be prohibited and that atomic weapons are not that scary. On February 15th, he signed his name for world peace. All five members of his family also signed their names.
    On the 14th and 15th, more than 80,000 employees of 36 state-owned factories and mining enterprises in Beijing's steel, coal, power, machinery, textile, and transportation industries signed their names on the "Appeal to the People of the World."
    At the same time as the employees of Beijing signed their names, the farmers in the suburbs of Beijing also started the signature campaign.
    On the afternoon of the 14th, the wind was very strong, and the flying sand made it difficult for people to open their eyes, but dozens of members of the Zhang Guozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs of Beijing were digging stones in the riverbed. Their labor was to support the construction of the capital and to make up for the losses caused by the disaster last year. People who have shown heroism in labor cherish peace even more. This day was the first day of the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons. The people who dug stones came back from the riverbed, and they did not even go home, but took their farm tools to sign their names. They said that digging stones is for construction, and opposing the use of atomic weapons is to protect construction. We did two things in one day, but both are for one purpose.
    Wang Wenwei, the deputy director of the Zhang Guozhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative, talked about his views on atomic energy after signing his name. He said: Our cooperative is now using tractors to cultivate the land. In the year before last, we used animal power for most of the sowing, and last winter we used machines to sow thousands of acres of densely planted wheat. This spring, we will use machines to sow even more. The average yield of wheat sown by animal power is 130 kilograms per mu, while the planned yield of wheat sown by machines is 208 kilograms, which means an increase of more than 70 kilograms per mu. The Soviet elder brother has already used atomic energy to generate electricity. It would be great to use atomic energy to generate electricity and supply us with more resources for farming. At that time, we do not know how much our production would increase! But American imperialism wants to use atomic weapons to destroy production, and we hate it very much. We farmers absolutely oppose this kind of action by the United States.
    Woman Liang Huaizhen said: American imperialism intends to use atomic weapons to scare us, but no one here is afraid. We are signing our names today to reflect our opinions. Since liberation, not only has such a large agricultural production cooperative been established in our township, but also a folk school, a cultural station, a credit cooperative, and a supply and marketing cooperative. The state will also build a middle school for us! In Dongheyan Village alone, there are now more than 100 children studying in primary schools, and more than 30 studying in senior primary schools and middle schools; but before liberation, except for the children of three landlords, the children of farmers simply did not study in senior primary schools and middle schools. We adults work during the day and read and write at the cultural station at night by the light of gasoline lamps. This was never possible before liberation. We have already obtained such a good life. Who would be willing to give it up? American imperialism's conspiracy to use atomic weapons and invade our country is to destroy our kind of life. This is called trying to do things that cannot be done. Everyone will oppose this kind of unreasonable thing.
    When Liang Decai, a new member of the agricultural production cooperative, talked about the United States' use of atomic weapons, he thought of the Japanese devils' invasion of China. He said, "Look, we live next to the Lugou Bridge, which is where the Japanese devils started the war of aggression more than a decade ago. At that time, the Japanese devils entered our doors with bayonets picking up the curtains. They thought they were very powerful, but we were not afraid. After several years of resistance, they finally failed. The Japanese devils could not scare us. Can American imperialism scare us effectively? It does not need to scare us. The Soviet elder brother's research on atomic energy is more sophisticated than theirs, and our strength is greater than theirs. As long as we do a good job in production and construction and unite with the peace-loving people of all countries, we will be able to defeat any imperialist aggression."
    The farmers of Zhang Guozhuang had a lot to say when they talked about opposing the use of atomic weapons. Even when the lights came on very late, the people who gathered had not gone home for dinner. In just this one day, the number of people who signed their names almost reached half of the total number of farmers in the township.
    On the 14th and 15th, the signature campaign also began in 20 universities in the capital, with more than 50,000 people signing. On the afternoon of the 14th, in the main campus of Renmin University of China at No. 1 Tieshi Zi Hutong, teachers and students had just finished a day's work and came to the square to hold a signature rally against the use of atomic weapons with more than 2,000 people. Vice President Hu Xikui made a report on launching the signature campaign. After Zou Yuzhen, a freshman girl, read the "Appeal to the People of the World" by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council in an impassioned voice in front of the loudspeaker, the enthusiastic signature began. The signature tables around the square were crowded with people, and people solemnly wrote their names on pink and sky-blue signature papers. Among those who signed were Zhu Guohua, a national model worker and an excellent student in the third year of the Department of Industrial Economics. The expression of this worker-born student, who will graduate from university this summer, seemed very excited when he signed his name. He said: Just when we Chinese people are resolutely demanding the liberation of Taiwan, working hard to build our own motherland, and living a peaceful and happy life, American imperialism is frantically preparing to conduct atomic war, which we absolutely cannot tolerate! We resolutely oppose the aggressive behavior of American imperialism! We have the confidence and determination to defend our motherland and defend world peace. At the signature rally held at the West Suburb Campus of Renmin University of China, Lu Agou, a representative of the National People's Congress studying in the preparatory course and a Shanghai industrial labor model, Guo Junqing, a special female combat hero of the People's Liberation Army, Gao Yubao, a writer from the army, Hao Jianxiu, a national famous textile industry labor model studying in the Workers and Peasants' Secondary School, and Zhou Tiancai, a combat hero of the People's Liberation Army, all solemnly signed their names. They expressed their love for their school and the peaceful and happy learning life, but if American imperialism dares to frantically launch an atomic war, they will go to the forefront of the battle and resolutely oppose the aggression of American imperialism.

    首都人民的和平意志
    本报记者
    当原子战争的乌云正在日益威胁着人类和平生活的时候，我们伟大祖国的首都北京的人民，和全国、全世界人民一起，展开了规模壮阔、声势浩大的反对使用原子武器的签名运动。这个运动是人民保卫和平力量的大检阅，人民也必然能够经过这个运动更加增强保卫和平的信心。
    二月十四日，是北京人民反对使用原子武器签名运动的第一日。如同在历次保卫和平事业中所表现的一样，北京工人阶级站在运动的最前列。十四日一早，反对使用原子武器签名运动就在各厂矿和建筑工地开始了。许多工厂的车间都悬挂着以反对使用原子武器为内容的巨幅标语，大字报和漫画。许多黑板报也都换上了新的内容。工人们、技术人员们和职员们，在机器旁边、在自己的工作岗位上，庄严地宣读了世界和平理事会常务委员会“告全世界人民书”，并签了自己的名字。第一汽车附件厂举行的反对原子武器签名运动大会上，到会的一千五百八十二名职工，全体都签了名，并在签名以后，热烈鼓掌，高唱“全世界人民心一条”的歌曲，表达自己反对使用原子武器的意志。十四日，石景山钢铁厂各车间、食堂和公共场所都挤满了签名的工人和家属。洗煤场十三个轮休的工人，听到工人们举行反对使用原子武器签名大会的消息以后，也赶到工厂签了名。签名运动使人们想到世界上使用原子能的两条路线。北京市劳动模范、石景山钢铁厂工人侯德成在签名时说：“苏联把原子能用来发电，为人类造福，美帝国主义却想用原子能来发动战争，大量毁灭人类！我们要用全面超额完成二月份的生产任务的实际行动来反对使用原子武器，支援解放台湾的斗争！”长辛店机车车辆修理工厂职工是在十五日下午集会签名的，签名的职工有三千二百八十一名。这个厂的曾经参加过
  “二七”大罢工的老工人刘禄在签名时说：“我一生经历过无数次战争，看见过无数的先烈为革命事业流血牺牲了。今天我们的和平幸福生活是先烈们的鲜血换来的，我们决不允许任何人来破坏它！我是我们工厂货车车间的领工员，我儿子也在厂子里当镟床工人，我们父子俩和全厂工人，一定要搞好生产，争取多出货车，支援解放台湾。”长辛店机车车辆修理工厂动力车间压风工长张振钢，在日本帝国主义侵略中国的时候，曾被抓到日本去做劳工。他曾听人讲过日本广岛人民遭受美国原子弹轰炸的惨况，他也亲眼看见过广岛又经日本人民恢复以后的情形。耳闻目睹的事实使他更加懂得必须禁止使用原子武器和原子武器并不是那么可怕的道理。二月十五日，他为了世界和平签下了自己的名字。他一家五口人也都签下了名字。
    十四、十五两日，北京市钢铁、煤矿、电业、机器、纺织、交通运输等三十六个国营厂矿企业，有八万多名职工在“告全世界人民书”上签了自己的名字。
    和北京市职工签名同时，北京郊区的农民也开始了签名运动。
    十四日下午，风刮得很大，飞沙使人很难睁开眼睛，可是北京市郊区张郭庄农业生产合作社的几十个社员正在河滩里挖石头。他们的劳动是为了支援首都的建设，也是为了弥补去年因遭灾而减产的损失。在劳动中表现英勇的人们，对和平也更加珍爱。这一天正是为反对使用原子武器开始签名的一天。挖石头的人们从河滩里回来，连家都没有回，就带着农具去签了名。他们说，挖石头是为了建设，反对使用原子武器是为了保卫建设，我们一天作了两件事，可是都为了一个目的。
    张郭庄农业生产合作社的副主任王文慰在签名之后，谈到自己对原子能的一些看法。他说：我们社现在已经用拖拉机耕地了。前年我们大半还用畜力播种，去年冬天就用机器播种了上千亩密植小麦，今年春天还要用机器播种。用畜力播种的小麦每亩平均收一百三十斤，用机器播种的就计划要收到二百零八斤，这就是说每亩要增加七十多斤的产量。苏联老大哥已经用原子能发电了。把原子能用来发电，供给我们种地多好，那时我们的生产不知道还要提高多少！可是美帝国主义却要用原子武器破坏生产，我们真是痛恨极了。美国的这种行动，我们农民绝对反对。
    妇女梁怀贞说：美帝国主义打算用原子武器吓唬我们，可是我们这里却没有一个人害怕。我们今天签名，就是要反映我们的意见。我们这个乡，在解放以后不但建立了这样大的农业生产合作社，并且有了民校，文化站，信用部，供销合作社，国家还要给我们建立一个中学哩！单是东河沿村现在在小学读书的就有一百多个孩子，在高小、中学读书的有三十多个；可是解放以前，除了三户地主的子弟外，农民的子弟根本就没有在高小、中学读书的。我们成年人每天白天劳动，晚上在文化站点着汽灯看书识字，这是解放前从来没有的。我们已经得到这样好的生活，你想谁还能舍得放下吗？美帝国主义阴谋使用原子武器，对我国侵略，就是要破坏我们这样的生活，这就叫不可作的事情硬要作，这种不讲道理的事，谁都会反对的。
    农业生产合作社的新社员梁德财一谈到美国要使用原子武器，就想起了日本鬼子对中国的侵略。他说，你看，我们就住在芦沟桥的旁边，这就是十几年以前日本鬼子挑起侵略战争的地方。那时，日本鬼子进我们的门，都是用刺刀挑起帘子进来的。他们觉得自己很厉害，可是我们却没有怕。经过几年抗战，他们终于失败了。日本鬼子吓不住我们，美帝国主义吓唬我们就能见效吗？它不用吓我们，苏联老大哥对原子能的研究比他们更精通，我们的力量比他们更大。我们只要好好生产建设，和爱和平的各国人民团结起来，就能够打退任何帝国主义的侵略。
    张郭庄的农民谈起反对使用原子武器，每人都有很多话要说，直到上灯已经很晚的时候，集会的群众还没有回家去吃晚饭。仅仅这一天，签名的人数就几乎达到了全乡农民总数的一半。
    十四、十五两日，签名运动在首都二十个高等学校也开始了，签名人数达到了五万多人。十四日下午，在铁狮子胡同一号中国人民大学的校本部里，教师和同学们才上完了一天的功课，便纷纷来到广场上，举行了两千多人的反对使用原子武器签名运动大会。副校长胡锡奎作了开展签名运动的报告，一年级女生邹玉珍用激昂的声音在扩音器前宣读了世界和平理事会常务委员会“告全世界人民书”以后，热烈的签名便开始了。广场四周的签名桌前都挤满了人，在粉红色、天蓝色的签名纸上，人们庄严地写下了自己的名字。签名的人中间有全国工业劳动模范、工业经济系三年级优秀学生朱国华。这个今年暑假就要在大学毕业的工人出身的学生，签名时的表情显得十分激动。他说：正当我们中国人民坚决要求解放台湾，努力建设自己的祖国，过和平幸福生活的时候，美帝国主义却疯狂地准备进行原子战争，这是我们绝对不能容忍的！我们坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略行为！我们有信心和决心保卫我们的祖国，保卫世界和平。在中国人民大学西郊校部召开的签名集会上，在预科学习的全国人民代表大会代表、上海市工业劳动模范陆阿狗，人民解放军特等女战斗英雄郭俊卿，战士出身的作家高玉宝，和在工农速成中学学习的全国著名纺织工业劳动模范郝建秀，人民解放军战斗英雄周天才等都庄严地签了名。他们表示热爱自己的学校和和平幸福的学习生活，但是如果美帝国主义敢于疯狂地发动原子战争，他们将走上战斗的最前线，坚决起来反对美帝国主义的侵略。
