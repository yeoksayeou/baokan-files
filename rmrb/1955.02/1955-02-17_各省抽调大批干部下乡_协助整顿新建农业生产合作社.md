Provinces Dispatch Large Numbers of Cadres to the Countryside to Assist in Rectifying Newly Established Agricultural Production Cooperatives

The number of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide has increased from 400,000 before the new year to 580,000. With the exception of a few provinces, most regions have completed their development plans and are beginning to focus on rectifying and consolidating the newly established agricultural production cooperatives.

During this stage, the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement has been generally healthy in most areas, and farmers' enthusiasm for joining cooperatives has been generally high. However, among the nearly 500,000 newly established agricultural production cooperatives, a considerable number were established without preparation or with insufficient preparation. In addition, the winter rural work tasks were heavy, and the local leadership concentrated on the unified grain purchase, resulting in a lack of timely assistance to the new cooperatives. As a result, the organizational work of some cooperatives was relatively rough. In these cooperatives, the ideology of some members was not very stable, and some economic issues within the cooperative, such as the handling of compensation for draught animals and farm tools, and the raising of production funds, were not resolved in a timely and proper manner, and production work had not yet begun. In individual areas, newly established agricultural production cooperatives have already experienced collapse, disbandment, and member withdrawal.

Newly established agricultural production cooperatives can be roughly divided into three types: The first type, which is good in all aspects, generally accounts for 20% to 30%. The third type, which has a poor foundation, weak backbone, unstable member ideology, and many problems, is estimated to account for about 15% of the total number of new cooperatives based on the situation of more than 60,000 new cooperatives in Liaoning, Rehe, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces. About 2% to 3% of the new cooperatives are nominal and may collapse and disband. In other areas where the number of agricultural production cooperatives has increased significantly but the leadership cannot fully attend to them, the proportion of the third type of cooperative is even higher. In some counties in Hebei and Zhejiang provinces, it is estimated that about 10% of the cooperatives may collapse and disband. The second type of cooperative, which accounts for half or more than half of the total, also has many problems, and many of them are not very solid. In some of these cooperatives, the issues of production materials entering the cooperative have not been resolved or have not been resolved reasonably, while others lack experienced leadership, have disorganized labor organization, and cannot quickly enter production. The overall situation shows that after the large-scale development of agricultural production cooperatives, rectification and consolidation are urgently needed.

Now that the unified grain purchase has ended in most areas, local leading organs have begun to pay attention to the rectification and consolidation of new cooperatives and have successively dispatched large numbers of cadres to the countryside to assist in the work. At the same time, various training courses are being widely held to cultivate a large number of backbone forces in the work. For example, the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party plans to dispatch 7,000 cadres from provincial, county-level and above organs and 5,000 cadres from district-level organs to rural areas in early March to participate in the work of rectifying agricultural production cooperatives; and requires that each county have a prefectural committee-level cadre, each district have a county committee-level cadre, and each township have a district-level cadre to specifically grasp this work. At the same time, it plans to train 300 full-time accounting instructors to help new cooperatives establish financial accounting systems; it is expected that 120,000 backbone personnel for running cooperatives can be trained in the province this spring. Fujian Province plans to dispatch 10,000 cadres to the countryside. Sichuan Province has decided to dispatch 20,000 cadres to the countryside. Shaanxi Province has successively trained 30,000 cadres and is concentrating its efforts on developing and rectifying agricultural production cooperatives. Other provinces such as Guangxi and Henan are also preparing to dispatch tens of thousands of cadres to the countryside.

All localities have put forward the key points and issues to be noted in rectifying and consolidating agricultural production cooperatives based on their specific circumstances. The general goal is to quickly help new cooperatives transition to production. Many regions, based on the specific conditions of the new cooperatives, have carried out a series of tasks through education on cooperative charters, implementing the principle of voluntarism, stabilizing the thinking of the masses, and resolving major issues within the cooperative such as the handling of land, draught animals, and farm tools, the raising of production funds, and labor organization. Most areas have paid attention to implementing the Party's fundamental line of socialist transformation in rural areas, have begun to correct the phenomenon of excluding poor peasants, and have also prevented damage to the interests of middle peasants. The landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries who had infiltrated the cooperatives were purged. The Shijiazhuang Special District of Hebei Province has cleared out a number of landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries who had infiltrated more than 2,700 new cooperatives, consolidating the cooperatives organizationally. In addition, for some nominal cooperatives that cannot continue to operate after rectification, all localities have helped them to change to mutual aid teams in order to prepare conditions for establishing cooperatives in the future; they have also paid attention to striving for the masses to reorganize or dissolve some sham cooperatives manipulated and controlled by hostile elements. Although these two types of cooperatives are very few in number, they have attracted serious attention from all localities.

All localities have paid attention to using organizations such as mutual aid and cooperation networks and cooperative representative joint meetings to drive new cooperatives with old cooperatives and to promote the whole with key points in carrying out rectification and consolidation work. Experience has proven that in the situation of large-scale development of agricultural production cooperatives, this is one of the more successful leadership methods for following the mass line and running cooperatives well. The Shijiazhuang Special District of Hebei Province organized old cooperative directors to make typical reports through more than 1,000 mutual aid and cooperation networks and cooperative stations throughout the district, and imparted experience in running cooperatives to new cooperatives. The Xiliaocheng Station in Anping County, Hebei Province introduced the experience of formulating production plans, which promoted 25 new cooperatives around it to formulate production plans. Shahe County mobilized more than 100 old cooperative directors through the mutual aid and cooperation network to help villages rectify agricultural production cooperatives by using the method of pairing skilled hands with novices. Some regions have proposed the method of "one old leading three new," organizing old cooperative cadres to help new cooperatives solve various problems.

At present, some areas that started earlier on the work of rectifying and consolidating new cooperatives have already achieved considerable results. For example, in Shanxi and other places, after rectification, the relationship between the middle and poor peasants is harmonious, the enthusiasm for production is high, and they have generally formulated production plans for 1955 and are actively carrying out spring plowing preparations. More than 70% of the new cooperatives in Henan Province have been put into production. In the work of rectifying and consolidating new cooperatives, there have also been a few cases of simplification, crudeness, and formalism in some areas, and attention is being paid to correcting them.

    各省抽调大批干部下乡
    协助整顿新建农业生产合作社
    全国农业生产合作社已从年前的四十万个发展到五十八万个。除少数省份外，绝大部分地区已完成发展计划，开始全力整顿和巩固新建立的农业生产合作社。
    在这一阶段中，绝大部分地区互助合作运动的发展是健康的，农民入社情绪一般是高涨的。但是在新建立的约近五十万个农业生产合作社中，有相当一部分是在无准备或准备不足的条件下建立的；加以冬季农村工作任务繁重，各地领导力量多集中进行粮食统购工作，对新社帮助不及时，因此，有一部分社的组织工作比较粗糙。在这些社中，有些社员思想不很稳定，社内一些经济问题，如耕畜、农具报酬的处理，生产资金的筹集等，都没有及时妥善地解决，生产工作也没有着手安排；个别地区新建立的农业生产合作社已发生垮台散伙和社员退社的现象。
    新建立的农业生产合作社大致可以分为三种类型：第一种类型，即各方面都好的社，一般占百分之二十至三十。第三种类型，即基础差、骨干弱、社员思想不安、存在问题较多的社，据辽宁、热河、吉林、黑龙江四省六万多个新社的情况估计，约占新社总数百分之十五，新社中约有百分之二到三有名无实，可能垮台和散伙。在农业生产合作社发展数量较大、领导力量还不能充分照顾的其他地区，第三种类型的社的比重还要大些。在河北、浙江两省若干县份，估计可能垮台和散伙的社约占百分之十左右。占半数或半数以上的第二种类型的社，也有不少问题，其中有许多还不很巩固。这些社中，有的是生产资料入社等问题没有解决或解决得不合理，有些是领导骨干缺少经验，劳动组织混乱，不能很快进入生产。整个情况说明：农业生产合作社大量发展之后，急需进行整顿和巩固。
    现在粮食统购工作在绝大部分地区已经结束，各地领导机关已开始重视新社的整顿和巩固工作，并先后抽调大批干部下乡帮助工作，同时普遍举办各种训练班，大量培养工作中的骨干力量。如中共安徽省委计划在三月初从全省县级以上机关抽调干部七千人、区级机关抽调五千人，深入农村参加整顿农业生产合作社的工作；并要求每县有一地委级干部，每区有一县委级干部，每乡有一区级干部，具体掌握这项工作。同时，计划训练专职会计辅导员三百人，帮助新社建立财务会计制度；预计春季全省可先后训练各种办社骨干十二万人。福建省计划抽调一万名干部下乡。四川省决定抽调两万名干部下乡。陕西省先后训练了三万名干部，正集中力量进行发展和整顿农业生产合作社的工作。其他如广西、河南等省，也准备抽调上万名干部下乡。
    各地都根据具体情况，提出了整顿和巩固农业生产合作社的重点和应注意的问题，总的目标是迅速帮助新社转入生产。许多地区根据新社的具体情况，通过社章教育，对于贯彻自愿原则，稳定群众思想，对当前社内重大问题如土地、耕畜、农具的处理，生产资金的筹集和劳力组织等问题的解决，进行了一系列的工作。大部地区都注意贯彻党在农村中实行社会主义改造的根本路线，开始纠正排斥贫农的现象，同时也防止对中农利益的损害。对于混入社内的地主、富农、反革命分子进行了清洗。河北省石家庄专区有二千七百多个新社已清除出一批混入社内的地主、富农、反革命分子，从组织上巩固了社。此外，各地对于某些有名无实的社，经过整顿还不能办下去的，就帮助他们改为互助组，以便准备条件将来建社；对一些为敌对分子所操纵掌握的冒牌的社，也注意争取群众加以改组或解散。这两种社虽为数极少，但已引起各地的严重注意。
    各地都注意运用互助合作网、合作代表联席会等组织，以老社带动新社，以重点推动一般，进行整顿和巩固工作。经验证明，在农业生产合作社大发展的情况下，这是走群众路线办好社的较为成功的领导方法之一。河北省石家庄专区通过全区一千多个互助合作网和合作站，组织老社长做典型报告，向新社传授办社经验。河北省安平县西聊城站介绍了订生产计划的经验，推动了周围二十五个新社订出生产计划。沙河县通过互助合作网，动员一百多名老社社长，用熟手搭配生手的办法，帮助各村整顿农业生产合作社。有些地区提出“一老带三新”的办法，组织老社干部帮助新社解决各种问题。
    目前，一些对整顿和巩固新社工作着手较早的地区，已经有了相当的成绩。如山西等地，经过整顿的社，中贫农关系融洽，生产情绪高涨，普遍制定了一九五五年生产计划，积极进行春耕准备工作。河南省新社已有百分之七十以上投入生产。在整顿和巩固新社工作中，也有少数地区发生了简单粗糙和形式主义的现象，正在注意纠正。
