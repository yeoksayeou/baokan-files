    The Will of the Chinese People
    Lian Kuoru, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Quyi Research Association
    In the past, I didn't know what an atomic bomb was. I learned about it towards the end of the Anti-Japanese War. At that time, I was in Beijing and suddenly heard that the United States had dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan, and that Japan had surrendered. It was said that Hiroshima would be barren for fifty years as a result. At that time, I could only hear one side of the propaganda and mistakenly thought that Japan surrendered because of the atomic bomb. Later, I learned that it wasn't that simple. At that time, Japan still had hundreds of thousands of Kwantung Army troops in Northeast China. How could Japan willingly surrender because of one atomic bomb? Later, after we watched the movie about Hiroshima, we also knew that the atomic bomb did not render Hiroshima barren. Not only were there people living there, but there were also pigs alive! The real reason for Japan's surrender was that the Soviet Union sent troops to Northeast China, forcing Japan to surrender. This is a fact that everyone is already clear about, but American imperialism still wants to use atomic weapons to scare people. Isn't this daydreaming?

    Throughout history, the victory or defeat of a war depends on people. A person who is unhealthy and unjust, even if they have good weapons, will not win a war. There are many contradictions within the imperialist United States, and there are also many contradictions between imperialist countries. The American people are unwilling to fight, and using atomic weapons to provoke war is unjust. Therefore, in the face of powerful peace-loving democratic countries, even if American imperialism has atomic weapons, they are weak and trembling. How great can they be? This has been seen in the armistices in Korea and Indochina. If the forces of peace were not strong, would the United States be willing to give up? Furthermore, the United States no longer has a monopoly on atomic weapons and has lost its advantage.

    Since World War II, people all over the world have been affected by war, and everyone opposes war. American imperialism, however, uses atomic weapons to scare people, engages in aggression everywhere, and also intimidates the Chinese people, hindering the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. In fact, the strength of the Chinese people has grown through struggle. The Japanese manufactured decades of artillery shells and dropped them on Chinese territory, but the Chinese people were not crushed. Instead, the entire country was liberated. Therefore, the Chinese people have the clearest understanding of imperialism, and intimidation will not work. Liberating Taiwan is our own internal affair; what does it have to do with the United States? Chiang Kai-shek is a traitor, and the United States is colluding with a thief, yet they claim to be defending against Chinese aggression against the United States. This reasoning makes no sense anywhere. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, and this is a will that can never be changed.

    I am a storyteller, and today I not only want to sign my name in opposition to the American use of atomic weapons, but also actively support the struggle to liberate Taiwan. I will tell the truth in my storytelling and show the power of the people.

    中国人民的意志
    中国曲艺研究会副主席　连阔如
    在早，我还不晓得原子弹是个什么东西，我晓得它，是在抗日战争的末期。我那时在北京，忽然听得说美国在日本广岛扔了原子弹，日本就投降了，并说，那一下就使广岛五十年都寸草不生。我那时只能听到一面的宣传，误认日本投降就是吃了原子弹轰炸。后来，我才知道并不是那么回事，那时日本还有数十万关东军在东北，日本那会因为一颗原子弹就甘心投降？以后我们看了有关广岛的电影，也知道原子弹并没有使广岛寸草不生，那里不但还有人住着，并且还有猪活着哩！日本投降的真正原因，是苏联在东北出了兵，逼得日本不得不投降了。这是大家都已经清楚了的事实，可是美国帝国主义还想用原子武器吓人，这不是作梦吗？
    古今中外，战争的胜败决定于人。一个又不健康，又屈理的人，就是手里拿了好刀枪，也不会打胜仗。美国这个帝国主义国家里矛盾很多，帝国主义各国之间的矛盾也很多，美国人民又不愿意打仗，又加上他用原子武器挑拨战争是屈理的，所以美国帝国主义在强大的和平民主国家的面前，就是有原子武器，手里拿着也是无力的，发抖的，他还能有多大了不起？这从朝鲜、印度支那的停战上都看出来了，要不是和平的力量强大，美国还肯罢手？再说，美国现在在原子武器方面，也不能垄断了，而且失去了它的优势。
    第二次世界大战后，全世界人民都受到战争的影响，大家都反对战争。美帝国主义却用原子武器吓人，到处侵略，并且还吓唬中国人民，阻挠中国人民解放台湾。其实，中国人民的力量是从斗争中壮大起来的，日本人制造了几十年的炮弹都投到中国的领土上，中国人民也没有被压倒，反而全国得到了解放。因此，中国人民对于帝国主义是认识得最清楚的，吓唬不能见效。解放台湾本是我们自己国内的事，于美国有什么相干？蒋介石是卖国贼，美国和盗贼结合，却说是要防御中国侵略美国哩，这个理到那里也说不通。中国人民一定要解放台湾，这是永远也不能改变的意志。
    我是个说书的艺人，我今天不但要自己签上名，反对美国使用原子武器，而且还要积极支援解放台湾的斗争。我要在我的说书当中讲出真理来，表现人民的力量。
