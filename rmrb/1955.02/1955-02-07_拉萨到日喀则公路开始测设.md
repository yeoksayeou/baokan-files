The survey for the Lhasa-Shigatse highway route has begun. Three survey teams dispatched by the Highway Bureau of the Ministry of Communications of the People's Republic of China have recently departed from Lhasa in batches. A survey team formed by the First Design Branch has also set out for the construction site. The first group of personnel began the survey work on the Gyantse to Shigatse section in early February, and this section is expected to be completed by the end of February.

The construction of the Lhasa-Shigatse highway is a measure taken by the State Council to provide relief to the people affected by the disaster in the Gyantse and Shigatse areas last year, implementing work-for-relief programs to help disaster victims overcome the famine and rebuild their homes. It is also aimed at further improving internal transportation in Tibet and strengthening the exchange of materials. The Tibetan local government and all disaster victims in the Gyantse and Shigatse areas are very grateful to the central government for continuing to build this highway. The Gyantse and Shigatse disaster relief committees are preparing to convene a road construction conference to mobilize disaster victims to participate in road construction. (Xinhua News Agency)

    拉萨到日喀则公路开始测设
    拉萨到日喀则的公路线路开始测设。中华人民共和国交通部公路总局派出的三个测量队，已在最近分批从拉萨出发。第一设计分局组成的一个勘测队亦出发前往工地。第一批人员在二月初即开始江孜到日喀则段的测设工作，这段线路预计二月底可以测设完毕。
    修筑拉萨到日喀则的公路，是国务院为了救济江孜、日喀则地区去年被灾人民，实行以工代赈，帮助灾民度过灾荒、重建家园，同时也为了进一步改进西藏内部交通运输，加强物资交流。西藏地方政府和江孜、日喀则地区的所有灾民对中央继续修筑这条公路非常感激。江孜、日喀则两地救灾委员会正在准备召开修路会议，以便发动灾民参加修路。（新华社）
