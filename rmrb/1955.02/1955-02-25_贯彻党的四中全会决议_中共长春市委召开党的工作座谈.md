    The CPC Changchun Municipal Committee recently held a symposium on Party work. Attending the symposium were the secretaries of Party organizations from various government organs, factories, enterprises, and schools, the secretaries of district committees, and key Party member cadres engaged in administrative work, totaling 295 people. The purpose of the symposium was to further implement the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party and to examine and criticize the adverse tendencies of neglecting Party leadership and neglecting Party ideological work.

    The symposium first heard the Municipal Committee's "Preliminary Inspection Report on Neglecting Party Leadership and Neglecting Party Work," and then proceeded to conduct discussions in an atmosphere of fully promoting democracy and carrying out criticism and self-criticism.

    The symposium believed that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the Party organizations in Changchun City have successfully completed various tasks and construction tasks of the Party during the economic recovery period. At the same time, the Party's ranks have also been tempered and strengthened in practice. In particular, after studying the Party's general line and the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party, the political and ideological consciousness of Party members has been increasing day by day, the Party's organization has become more developed and consolidated, the Party's connection with the masses has become closer, and the leadership level of Party organizations at all levels has also been improved. However, based on the tasks of socialist construction and socialist transformation undertaken by the Party during the transition period, and based on the spirit of the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party, there are still many problems in many Party organizations and Party member cadres, especially the fairly common phenomenon of neglecting Party leadership and neglecting Party work. The existence of this phenomenon is detrimental to the cause of our Party and must be thoroughly criticized and overcome.

    The phenomenon of neglecting Party leadership and neglecting Party work is first manifested in the insufficient understanding, research, and publicity of major issues in the Party's leadership role, Party building, and Party life over the past few years. Many comrades are still very vague about the fundamental issue that determines the success or failure of socialism—the Party's leadership role—and even intentionally or unintentionally misinterpret the nature of the Party, reduce the Party's leadership role, and undermine the Party's principles. For example, in some state-owned factories and enterprises, the joint meeting of Party, government, labor union, and Communist Youth League has long replaced the Party committee. Many major issues are not discussed at the Party committee meeting, but are decided and handled by the "joint meeting" convened by the factory director. Some units regard this "joint meeting" as the "highest authority," which in fact puts this "joint meeting" above the Party organization, reducing or even canceling the Party's leadership role. Some administrative leading cadres of factories and enterprises oppose the administrative cadre responsibility system to the Party's guarantee and supervision role, distorting the responsibility system of administrative cadres at all levels into arbitrary actions that are detached from the Party's leadership and supervision and detached from the masses. They only want the Party's "guarantee" and do not want the Party's supervision, while some place individuals above the Party organization, viewing the Party as an "accessory" of the administrative organ. For major issues in the enterprise, they make their own decisions without discussing them with the Party committee, while others openly say: "The task can be completed without a Party organization," and "Work can be done without Party members." Some leading cadres in state organs, financial and economic departments, universities, and specialized schools only emphasize the importance of administrative work, financial and economic tasks, and teaching work, but rarely care about the Party's political and ideological work.

    Secondly, it is manifested in the fact that many Party organizations are not good at adopting the method of combining political work with economic work to carry out work, but instead use administrative work methods to carry out work. Some Party committee members, especially Party committee secretaries, are almost indistinguishable from administrative organs in their daily activities. They are also busy with administrative affairs and economic affairs all day long, neglecting the Party's political and ideological work. The phenomenon of neglecting the role of Party organizations is also very serious among the working cadres of many grassroots Party organizations. They do not go through the Party organization, do not educate and mobilize all Party members to lead the broad masses to complete various work tasks, but are accustomed to administrative orders and the working methods of individual efforts. For example, in the basic construction department, some Party branch secretaries run to the site every day to help foremen deliver letters, make phone calls, and urge task lists; in factories, some branch secretaries go to the workshop to count screws, watch workers work, approve leave requests for workers, approve marriages, allocate labor, and so on. This actually reduces the Party's leadership role in economic work and weakens the Party organization's combat effectiveness. There are also some cadres who are unwilling to do Party affairs work and prefer to do administrative work.

    When arranging work for each period, many Party committees often fail to make unified arrangements for Party building, especially the building of Party grassroots work, in conjunction with the central work, and often regard it as the work of the propaganda department and the organization department. Sometimes, even if it is mentioned in the work plan of the Party committee, it still cannot attract the attention of all Party members because it is not clearly stated or placed in an unimportant position. Therefore, many Party member cadres do not care about the Party's work, and they are indifferent when the Party's construction tasks cannot be completed. This will affect the development of the Party's work.

    Due to the existence of the phenomenon of neglecting Party leadership and neglecting Party work, the Party's fine traditions cannot be well promoted in these places. Many Party member cadres have developed complacency and lack a high degree of political responsibility and enthusiasm for the revolutionary cause; they lack a mass viewpoint, ignore the role of the masses, do not pay attention to promoting democracy, cannot carry out criticism and self-criticism, especially cannot provide convenient conditions for carrying out criticism from below; they are unwilling to go deep into the grassroots to do detailed investigation and research work, but are willing to issue orders and instructions from above, adopting simplified methods to lead work. More seriously, they do not abide by the Party's leadership principles and even undermine the Party's leadership principles.

    The symposium, in the spirit of criticism and self-criticism, examined and criticized this tendency to neglect Party leadership and neglect Party ideological work. The comrades who participated in the meeting clearly realized that this erroneous tendency has caused great harm to the revolutionary cause. They all made relatively profound examinations and criticisms in connection with their own thinking and work style. At the same time, everyone also raised some criticisms and opinions on the leadership of the Municipal Committee.

    In order to thoroughly overcome this erroneous tendency of neglecting Party leadership and neglecting Party ideological work, the symposium believes that it is necessary to improve the ideological consciousness of all Party members, especially the Party's leading cadres, thoroughly criticize and overcome bourgeois individualism, and change the work style:

    1.  Intensively study the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party, improve ideological awareness, and make all Party members understand that the consolidation of the Party is the prerequisite for realizing the general line. Without the Party's strong leadership, without the Party's iron-like unity and solidarity, there would be no realization of the Party's general line, and there would be no socialism. In this way, the whole Party can be mobilized to be vigilant, determined to strengthen the Party's unity, improve the Party's combat effectiveness, strengthen the Party's leadership role in national construction, and fight against all phenomena that violate the Party's principles and neglect the Party's work, so as to ensure the smooth progress of our great socialist construction and socialist transformation cause.

    2.  Party committees at all levels must effectively strengthen the Party's work and change their leadership style. First of all, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the principle of collective leadership and resolutely fight against all phenomena that violate the principle of collective leadership. Strengthen the Party's political and ideological leadership, overcome bureaucracy and red tape, and closely connect with the broad masses. It is necessary to improve the Party's organizational structure and appropriately and gradually adjust a group of Party member cadres who have been tested, are loyal to the Party, have a correct work style, and have practical work experience to do Party affairs work. Secondly, it is necessary to strengthen the Party's ideological construction, organizational construction, especially the construction of grassroots work. In the future, when arranging work tasks for each period, it is necessary to arrange Party building work at the same time. When inspecting and summarizing the central work, it is also necessary to inspect and summarize the Party building work, especially to strengthen the specific leadership of the Party's grassroots organizations and help the grassroots branches improve their work and improve their leadership level. It is necessary to enable the grassroots Party organizations to become strong fortresses that closely connect with the masses, implement the Party's policies, and ensure the completion of various tasks. Thirdly, Party organizations at all levels must implement the method of combining political work with economic work, that is, they must rely on the Party organization, and through the Party's political and ideological work, mobilize all Party members to lead the broad masses to complete the task of economic construction. At the same time, it is also necessary to pay attention to preventing the deviation of carrying out Party affairs work in isolation from economic work. In state-owned factories and enterprises, in the process of strengthening the Party's political and ideological leadership and the Party's supervision and guarantee, it is also necessary to pay attention to strengthening and consolidating the responsibility system of administrative responsible cadres at all levels in the factory.

    3.  It is necessary to strengthen political work among the masses, and effectively strengthen the leadership of the work of trade unions and the Communist Youth League, promptly check their work, help them find ways, overcome difficulties, solve problems, and carry out work, so as to continuously improve the socialist consciousness of the masses.

### 贯彻党的四中全会决议  中共长春市委召开党的工作座谈

    贯彻党的四中全会决议
    中共长春市委召开党的工作座谈会
    中共长春市委在最近召开了党的工作座谈会。参加座谈会的有各机关、工厂、企业、学校党组织的书记、各区委书记、以及作行政工作的主要党员干部，共二百九十五人。座谈会的目的，是为了更进一步贯彻党的四中全会决议，检查和批判忽视党的领导、忽视党的思想工作的不良倾向。
    座谈会首先听取了市委“关于忽视党的领导与忽视党的工作的初步检查报告”，随后在充分发扬民主，开展批评和自我批评的气氛中进行了座谈。
    座谈会认为长春市党的组织在党中央的正确领导下，已胜利地完成了党在经济恢复时期的各项工作和建设任务，同时，在实践中也锻炼和壮大了党的队伍。特别是经过对党的总路线和党的四中全会决议的学习以后，党员的政治思想觉悟日益提高，党的组织更加发展和巩固，党和群众的联系也更加密切了，各级党组织的领导水平也有所提高。但是，根据过渡时期党所担负的社会主义建设和社会主义改造的任务来检查，根据党的四中全会决议精神来检查，在不少的党组织和党员干部中还存在着很多问题，特别是相当普遍地存在着忽视党的领导、忽视党的工作的现象，这种现象的存在，对我们党的事业是不利的，必须彻底地加以批判和克服。
    忽视党的领导和忽视党的工作的现象，首先表现在几年来对党的领导作用、党的建设、党的生活中的重大问题认识不足，研究和宣传不够，有许多同志对决定社会主义成败的根本问题——党的领导作用，还非常模糊，甚至有意无意地曲解了党的性质，降低了党的领导作用，破坏了党的原则。譬如在某些国营工厂企业中，长期以党、政、工、团碰头会代替了党委会，许多重大问题不在党委会上讨论，而由厂长召开的“碰头会”去决定处理，有的单位把这种“碰头会”当成了“最高权力机关”，这实际上是把这种“碰头会”放到党组织之上，降低甚至取消了党的领导作用。有些工厂企业的行政领导干部把行政干部负责制和党的保证和监督作用对立起来，把各级行政干部负责制曲解为脱离党的领导监督和脱离群众的独断专行，他们只要党的
  “保证”，不要党的监督，有的则把个人置于党组织之上，把党看成是行政机关的“附属品”，对企业中的重大问题，不经党委会讨论便自做主张，有的则公开地讲：“没有党组织也一样完成任务”、“没有党员也一样搞工作”。有些国家机关、财经部门、大学和专科学校中的领导干部，他们只强调行政工作、财经任务和教学工作重要，但是对党的政治思想工作则很少关心。
    其次表现在许多党的组织不善于采取政治工作与经济工作相结合的方法去进行工作，而是用行政工作方法去进行工作。有的党委委员尤其是党委书记，从他们的日常活动来看，几乎跟行政机关没有什么区别，他们也是终日忙于行政事务和经济事务，忽视了党的政治思想工作。许多基层党组织的工作干部，忽视党组织的作用的现象也很严重，他们不去通过党的组织，不去教育和发动全体党员带动广大群众去完成各项工作任务，而习惯于行政命令和个人单干的工作方式。如在基本建设部门，有的党支部书记天天跑现场，帮助工长送信、打电话、催任务单；在工厂中有的支部书记则是到车间数螺丝、看着工人干活、给工人批请假条、批准结婚、调配劳动力等等。这实际上就降低了党对经济工作的领导作用，削弱了党组织的战斗力。还有些干部不愿做党务工作，愿做行政工作。
    许多党委在安排每个时期的工作时，往往不能把党的建设，尤其是党的基层工作建设，结合中心工作作统一的安排，常常是把它看成是宣传部门与组织部门的工作。有时即使在党委会的工作计划上提到了，但由于提的不明确或放在无足轻重的地位上，仍不能引起全体党员的重视。因此，有许多党员干部不关心党的工作，当党的建设任务不能完成时，他们也无动于衷。这都会影响党的工作的开展。
    由于存在着忽视党的领导、忽视党的工作的现象，党的优良作风在这些地方就不能很好地发扬，有许多党员干部产生了骄傲自满情绪，对革命事业缺乏高度的政治责任心和积极性；缺乏群众观点，忽视群众的作用，不注意发扬民主，不能开展批评和自我批评，特别是不能给开展自下而上的批评以便利的条件；不愿意深入下层做细致的调查研究工作，而愿意从上面下命令、发指示，采取简单化的方法来领导工作，更严重的是不遵守党的领导原则，甚至破坏党的领导原则。
    座谈会以批评和自我批评的精神，检查和批判了这种忽视党的领导，忽视党的思想工作的倾向，参加会的同志明确地认识到这种错误倾向已给革命事业造成了很大的危害，都联系自己的思想作风做了比较深刻的检查和批判，同时，大家对市委领导上也提出了一些批评意见。
    为了彻底克服这种忽视党的领导，忽视党的思想工作的错误倾向，座谈会认为必须提高全体党员特别是党的领导干部的思想觉悟，彻底地批判和克服资产阶级个人主义思想，转变工作作风：
    一、深入地学习党的四中全会决议，提高思想觉悟，使全体党员都懂得：党的巩固是实现总路线的前提，没有党的坚强的领导，没有党的钢铁一样的统一和团结，就没有党的总路线的实现，就没有社会主义。这样就可动员全党提高警惕，下定决心，为增强党的团结，提高党的战斗力，加强党在国家建设中的领导作用，并与一切违背党的原则、忽视党的工作的现象作斗争，以保证我们伟大的社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业的顺利进行。
    二、各级党委必须切实地加强党的工作，转变领导作风。首先要认真地贯彻集体领导原则，与一切违背集体领导原则的现象作坚决斗争。加强党的政治思想领导，克服官僚主义和文牍主义，密切和广大群众的联系。要健全党的组织机构，适当地逐步地调整一批经过考验、对党忠诚、作风正派，而又有实际工作经验的党员干部作党务工作。其次要加强党的思想建设、组织建设，特别是基层工作建设。今后安排每个时期的工作任务时，必须同时安排党的建设工作。在检查、总结中心工作时，也必须检查与总结党的建设工作，特别是要加强对党的基层组织的具体领导，帮助基层支部改进工作，提高领导水平。必须使基层党组织能够成为密切联系群众，贯彻党的政策，保证完成各项任务的坚强堡垒。再次，各级党组织必须贯彻政治工作和经济工作相结合的方法，也就是说必须依靠党的组织，通过党的政治思想工作，动员全体党员带动广大群众去完成经济建设任务。同时，也要注意防止脱离经济工作孤立地去进行党务工作的偏向。在国营工厂企业中，在加强党的政治思想领导与党的监督保证过程中，同时要注意加强和巩固工厂各级行政负责干部的责任制。
    三、要加强群众中的政治工作，切实加强对工会、青年团工作的领导，及时检查他们的工作，帮助他们想办法，克服困难，解决问题，开展工作，以不断地提高群众的社会主义觉悟。
