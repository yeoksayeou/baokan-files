    The U.S. aggression clique, like the British authorities, is now starting to propagate the absurd argument that the status and sovereignty of Taiwan are undetermined.
    The U.S. Senate approved the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek war treaty on the 9th, and at the same time expressed "attention" to an "understanding" of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. This understanding states that the U.S.-Chiang treaty should not be interpreted as "affecting or changing" the "legal status or sovereignty" of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. On the same day, the United States Information Service published a "background material" which, like a parrot, copied what British Foreign Secretary Eden said in the British House of Commons on February 4th, stubbornly insisting that the legal status and sovereignty of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands remain to be resolved. With the official authorization of the United States, the American propaganda machine is also spreading the same argument.
    The U.S. government suddenly followed Eden in propagating the so-called issue of Taiwan's legal status and sovereignty, with the aim of using the so-called undetermined legal status of Taiwan to force the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs. The "background material" of the United States Information Service has repeatedly hinted that the so-called legal status of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands "may be resolved through the United Nations." At the same time, there are reports that the United Nations Security Council will discuss the Taiwan issue on the 14th in the absence of China's legitimate representatives. The U.S. aggression clique apparently believes that using this argument will help it win over its followers and make them serve the U.S. conspiracy to use the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs.
    However, the so-called issue of Taiwan's undetermined status, which is affixed with the U.S. trademark, is as unsalable among the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world as the same issue manufactured by Eden. The legal status and sovereignty of Taiwan has long been determined, and no one is allowed to deny it. The U.S. government has repeatedly affirmed and recognized that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are Chinese territory. On January 5, 1950, former U.S. Secretary of State Acheson issued a statement saying that Taiwan had been "transferred to the Chinese in accordance with the established (Cairo) Declaration and (Japanese) surrender terms." He also said, "The Chinese have ruled Taiwan for four years. The United States or any other ally has never questioned that power and occupation."
    On February 9, 1950, the U.S. State Department replied to the House Foreign Affairs Committee, saying that Taiwan had been "administered by China since the Japanese surrender in 1945. It has been included in China and become a province." The U.S. State Department also said, "All the allies, including the United States, have considered Taiwan to be a part of China for the past four years."
    Even in the U.S.-Chiang treaty, the United States affirmed that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are the "territory" of the so-called "Republic of China" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. In other words, the United States recognizes that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are Chinese territory.
    Now, the U.S. government is slapping itself in the face, following the British government in denying that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are part of Chinese territory. This not only shows the U.S. determination to secede Chinese territory and invade and occupy Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, but also proves that the support of the British authorities for U.S. aggression is an important reason why the United States dares to expand its aggression. However, no matter what conspiracy the United States plays, the Chinese people will never allow anyone to invade Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, nor will they allow anyone to use the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs. All attempts by the United States and its followers to force the Chinese people to tolerate U.S. aggression will ultimately be futile.

    美国侵略集团枉费心机
    蒋元椿
    美国侵略集团现在也和英国当局一样，开始宣传所谓台湾地位和主权未定的荒谬论调。
    美国参议院在九日批准了美蒋战争条约，同时表示“注意”到参议院外交委员会的一项“谅解”。这项谅解说，美蒋条约不应被解释为“影响或改变”了台湾和澎湖的“法律地位或主权”。同一天，美国新闻处发表了一项“背景材料”，其中依样画葫芦地抄袭了英国外交大臣艾登二月四日在英国下院所说的话，硬说台湾和澎湖的法律地位和主权问题尚待解决。在美国官方授意之下，美国的宣传机器也正在散布同样的论调。
    美国政府忽然跟着艾登宣传起所谓台湾法律地位和主权问题来，其目的是要利用所谓台湾的法律地位未定的问题，迫使联合国干涉中国的内政。美国新闻处的“背景材料”中已经一再暗示台湾和澎湖的所谓法律地位问题“也许要通过联合国来解决”。同时，有消息说，联合国安全理事会将在十四日在没有中国合法代表出席的情况下讨论台湾问题。美国侵略集团显然认为，利用这种论调，就有助于它拉拢它的追随者，使它们为美国的利用联合国来干涉中国内政的阴谋服务。
    然而贴上美国商标的所谓台湾的地位未定问题，就和艾登制造的同一个问题一样，在中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民中间是找不到市场的。台湾的法律地位和主权是早已确定了的，不容任何人否认。美国政府也一再肯定承认过台湾和澎湖是中国的领土。一九五○年一月五日，美国前国务卿艾奇逊发表声明说，台湾已经“依照已成立的（开罗）宣言及（日本）投降条件交与中国人。”他又说，“中国人已统治台湾四年。美国或任何其他盟国从未对该项权力及占领发生过任何疑问。”
    一九五○年二月九日美国国务院答复国会众议院外交委员会说，台湾自一九四五年日本投降以来，“即由中国管理。它已包括在中国之内，成为一省。”美国国务院还说，“包括美国在内的各盟国在过去四年中认为台湾是中国的一部分。”
    就是在美蒋条约中，美国也肯定台湾、澎湖是蒋介石卖国集团的所谓“中华民国”的“领土”。换句话说，美国承认台湾和澎湖都是中国的领土。
    现在，美国政府自己打自己的嘴巴，跟着英国政府否认台湾和澎湖是中国领土的一部分。这除了表明美国决心割裂中国领土、侵占台湾和澎湖以外，同时也证明英国当政者对美国侵略的支持，是美国敢于扩大侵略的一个重要原因。然而无论美国玩弄什么阴谋，中国人民决不容许任何人侵占台湾、澎湖，也决不容许任何人利用联合国干涉中国内政。美国和它的追随者的一切企图迫使中国人民容忍美国侵略的伎俩，到头来都只能是枉费心机。
