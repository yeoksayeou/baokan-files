Premier Zhou Enlai Replies to the United Nations Secretary-General

Our government firmly opposes New Zealand's suggestion of interfering in China's internal affairs, and will only agree to send representatives to the Security Council when discussing the Soviet proposal and expelling the Chiang Kai-shek bandit representatives.

[New China News Agency, 3rd] The full text of the telegram sent by Zhou Enlai, Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, to United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld on February 3, is as follows: To Mr. Hammarskjöld, United Nations Secretary-General, New York, and forwarded to Mr. Béland, Chairman of the Security Council.

      Your telegram of January 31, 1955, regarding the situation of the 690th meeting of the United Nations Security Council, has been received.
    The United States' aggression against China's territory of Taiwan has always been the root cause of the tense situation in the Far East. Recently, after the United States signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, it sent a large number of naval and air forces to Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait area, openly threatening and provoking war against the Chinese people, and preparing to expand its aggression against China, further intensifying the tense situation in the Far East. In order to ease the tension in the Far East, eliminate threats to China's security, and stop U.S. aggression, the Government of the People's Republic of China fully supports the Soviet representative's proposal in the United Nations Security Council regarding "the United States' acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan and other island regions of China," and firmly believes that the United Nations Security Council should condemn the United States' acts of aggression against China, demand that the United States immediately terminate its aggression against China and its interference in China's internal affairs, and withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait.
    Taiwan, Penghu, and other coastal islands are all inseparable parts of Chinese territory. It is entirely China's internal affair for the Chinese people to exercise their sovereignty and liberate their own territory. It has never caused international tension, nor is it possible to threaten international peace and security. However, the New Zealand representative has proposed that the United Nations Security Council consider the "hostile actions in certain island regions along the coast of mainland China" between the People's Republic of China and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. This is obviously interfering in China's internal affairs and covering up the United States' acts of aggression against China, and therefore directly violates the basic principles of the United Nations Charter. The Government of the People's Republic of China firmly opposes this proposal that violates the United Nations Charter and interferes in China's internal affairs.
    Since the United States occupied Taiwan in 1950, the People's Republic of China has repeatedly lodged accusations with the United Nations, demanding that the United Nations stop the United States' acts of aggression against China. However, the United Nations has not only consistently failed to take any action on the just accusations of the People's Republic of China, but has repeatedly slandered the People's Republic of China. What is especially intolerable is that the People's Republic of China, representing 600 million Chinese people, is still being deprived of its legitimate status and rights in the United Nations, while the representatives of a handful of Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique remnants, who have long been spurned by the Chinese people, are still usurping the position of representing China in the United Nations. This extremely unreasonable situation makes it impossible for the representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend United Nations discussions on issues related to China.
    Therefore, the Government of the People's Republic of China cannot accept the invitation of the United Nations Security Council to send representatives to participate in the discussion of New Zealand's proposal. At the same time, it must be pointed out that in the absence of representatives of the People's Republic of China representing China in the United Nations Security Council to participate in the discussion, the Security Council's decisions on issues related to China are illegal and invalid.
    The Government of the People's Republic of China believes that only when the representatives of the People's Republic of China attend representing China in order to discuss the Soviet proposal and expel the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek clique from the Security Council, can the People's Republic of China agree to send representatives to participate in the Security Council's discussions.
    The Government of the People's Republic of China has consistently worked to ease the tension in the Far East and safeguard the cause of international peace. The tense situation in the Taiwan area is caused by the United States' occupation of Taiwan and interference in China's internal affairs. All genuine efforts internationally to ease and eliminate the tension created by the United States in this region and other regions of the Far East will receive the support of the People's Republic of China.

Letter dated January 30, 1955, from the representative of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the President of the Security Council regarding the United States' acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan and other island regions of China (S/3355)." In approving its agenda, the Council decided that it would proceed to discuss the second item only after completing its consideration of the first item.

    周恩来总理复电联合国秘书长
    我国政府坚决反对干涉中国内政的新西兰建议，只有在讨论苏联提案并驱逐蒋贼代表的情况下才同意派代表出席安理会
    【新华社三日讯】中华人民共和国国务院总理兼外交部长周恩来在二月三日答复联合国秘书长达格·哈马舍尔德的电报全文如下：纽约联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德先生并转安全理事会主席贝朗德先生
      一九五五年一月三十一日关于联合国安全理事会第六九○次会议情况的来电收到。
    美国对中国的领土台湾的侵略，一直是造成远东紧张局势的根源。最近，美国在同蒋介石卖国集团签订了所谓“共同防御条约”以后，增派大批海空军到台湾和台湾海峡地区，公开对中国人民进行战争威胁和战争挑衅，准备扩大对中国的侵略，更加加剧了远东的紧张局势。为了和缓远东的紧张局势，消除对中国的安全的威胁，制止美国的侵略，中华人民共和国政府完全支持苏联代表在联合国安全理事会提出的关于“美国在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为”的提案，并坚决认为，联合国安全理事会应该谴责美国对中国的侵略行为，要求美国立即终止它对中国的侵略和对中国内政的干涉，从台湾和台湾海峡撤走它的一切武装力量。
    台湾、澎湖和其他沿海岛屿都是中国领土不可分割的一部分。中国人民行使自己的主权，解放自己的领土，完全是中国的内政，从来没有造成过国际的紧张局势，也不可能威胁国际的和平和安全。但是新西兰代表却提出了由联合国安全理事会审议中华人民共和国和蒋介石卖国集团“在中国大陆沿岸某些岛屿地区的敌对行动”的建议。这显然是干涉中国内政，掩盖美国对中国的侵略行为，因此直接违反了联合国宪章的基本原则。中华人民共和国政府坚决反对这一违反联合国宪章、干涉中国内政的建议。
    自从一九五○年美国侵占台湾以来，中华人民共和国曾一再向联合国提出控诉，要求联合国制止美国对中国的侵略行为。但是，联合国不但始终没有对中华人民共和国的正义控诉采取任何行动，反而一再对中华人民共和国进行诬蔑。尤其令人不能容忍的是：代表六万万中国人民的中华人民共和国至今仍被剥夺了在联合国中的合法地位和权利，而早为中国人民所唾弃的一小撮蒋介石卖国集团残余分子的代表却仍然在联合国中窃据代表中国的地位。这种极端不合理的情况就使中华人民共和国的代表无法出席联合国讨论有关中国的问题。
    因此，中华人民共和国政府不能应联合国安全理事会的邀请，派遣代表出席参加对新西兰的建议的讨论。同时必须指出，在没有中华人民共和国的代表在联合国安全理事会代表中国参加讨论的情况下，安全理事会对有关中国问题的决定都是非法的，无效的。
    中华人民共和国政府认为，只有在为了讨论苏联的提案并在安全理事会驱逐蒋介石集团的代表而由中华人民共和国的代表出席代表中国的情况下，中华人民共和国才能同意派遣代表参加安全理事会的讨论。
      中华人民共和国政府一贯为和缓远东紧张局势和保障国际和平的事业而努力。台湾地区的紧张局势是由美国侵占台湾、干涉中国内政造成的。国际上一切为和缓并消除美国在这个地区和远东其他地区所造成的紧张局势的真正努力，都将得到中华人民共和国的支持。
              中华人民共和国国务院总理兼外交部长  周恩来
                                   一九五五年二月三日于北京
        附：联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德致周恩来总理的电报
    北京
    中华人民共和国中央人民政府国务院总理兼外交部长周恩来先生阁下：
    （八六）我谨将下列情况转告您：安全理事会在一九五五年一月三十一日它的第六九○次会议上决定把下列各项目列入它的议程：“一、一九五五年一月二十八日新西兰代表致安全理事会主席函关于在中国大陆沿岸某些岛屿地区的敌对行动问题（S／三三五四）；二、一九五五年一月三十日苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟代表致安全理事会主席函关于美国在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为问题（S／三三五五）。”在批准它的议程时，理事会决定，它将在完成对第一个项目的审议之后，才进行讨论第二个项目。理事会进一步决定邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府派遣一位代表在讨论第一个项目期间出席理事会并参加辩论以便提出您的政府的意见。
                            联合国秘书长达格·哈马舍尔德
                                    一九五五年一月三十一日纽约
