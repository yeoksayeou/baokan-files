Blind Procurement Leads to Waste

To the Editor:

The Hangu Salt Field Workers' Hospital's blind acquisition of unnecessary equipment has resulted in serious waste.

This hospital has only one ophthalmologist, and never provides treatment at night, yet it spent 2 million yuan to buy a "night vision tester," which has never been used since its purchase. They spent more than 2 million yuan to buy an "esophageal examination device," which has only been used once or twice since its purchase. They spent 1.96 million yuan to buy a "megger," which is used to test electrical wires, but because they have no electrician, it has also been left unused. This hospital envisioned conducting experiments, so they bought eight rabbits, twelve guinea pigs, and forty frogs, but because no one is conducting experiments, they still have to spend 150,000 yuan each month on feed for these animals.

These are just a few examples. Other items such as the purchased motorcycle and asphalt felt are also not urgently needed.

### 盲目购置造成浪费

    盲目购置造成浪费编辑同志：
    汉沽盐场职工医院盲目添置不必要的设备，产生了严重的浪费现象。
    这个医院只有一位眼科大夫，夜间从来不进行治疗，却用二百万元买了一个“夜间视力器”，买后一次也未用过。他们用二百多万元买的“食道检查器”，买后也只用过一两次。用一百九十六万元买了一个“摇表”，这是试验电线用的，因为他们没有电工，也被积压起来。这个医院设想进行试验就买了八只家兔和十二头荷兰猪、四十只青蛙，但是，因为没有人试验，结果每月还要开支十五万元的饲料费喂养这些动物。
    这仅是几个例子。其他如所买的摩托车和油毡等，也都不是急需的。
