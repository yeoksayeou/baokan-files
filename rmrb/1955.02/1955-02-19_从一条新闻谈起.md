Starting with a News Item
Li Daohe

Last December, the editorial department of the Inner Mongolia Daily, while summarizing its work, focused on discussing a news item: "Hetao and Pingdi Quan Administrative Regions Fully Launch Grain Storage Work." Grasping a key point during the work summary for in-depth examination and research, to gradually improve and enhance the newspaper's work, is worthy of learning by newspapers in various regions.

The news item examined by the Inner Mongolia Daily was published on the newspaper on November 14th last year and was placed in a prominent position on the front page. The news was approximately 800 words long, discussing the importance attached to grain storage work by Party and government leading organs, how various regions carried out preparatory work such as repairing bridges and roads, organizing mass transportation forces, conducting patriotic education for farmers, and finally, the expected completion date of grain storage. At first glance, this news item seemed substantial. However, upon careful analysis, and when studied in connection with actual life and other news published in the newspaper, one would find that this news item had many problems, which also reflected shortcomings in the editorial department's organization of news reports.

First, what is the center of news reporting? It should be said that it is the activities of the people. The people are the true creators of history, and their activities must constitute the center of our news reporting. As Ko Chieh-fu pointed out in "On News Reporting," "Living people and their selfless, heroic labor, as well as their patriotic pioneering spirit and innovative spirit, should become the center of news reporting." Analyzing the news item "Hetao and Pingdi Quan Administrative Regions Fully Launch Grain Storage Work," it actually contains the following content: farmers began paying grain; the government repaired bridges and roads to facilitate grain delivery by farmers; farmers signed grain transportation contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives; farmers paid the best grain to the state; farmers delivered grain faster than in previous years, and so on. These could have been written into news items with clear objectives and capable of expressing the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers. However, because the editors did not clearly recognize that the center of news reporting should be the activities of the people, they focused on the "grain storage work" aspect when handling this news item, rather than fully reflecting the grain payment and delivery activities of the farmers. Thus, the aforementioned patriotic actions of the masses of farmers in actively paying and delivering grain were only generally cited as achievements of the leading organs. For example, the activities of the masses of farmers in signing transportation contracts with the state to support the state's grain allocation became a footnote to "various regions actively organizing mass forces to transport grain" in the news. Moreover, many vivid facts about the active grain payment and delivery by the broad masses of farmers, especially some agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, were not fully expressed or independently handled because the editors were keen on summarizing the overall work situation.

Of course, news reports can and should reflect the activities of leading organs, and it is also necessary to summarize the progress of important work at appropriate times; there is no doubt about this. However, newspapers cannot be satisfied with this; they should strive to reflect the activities of the people as fully as possible, and strive to profoundly express how the requirements of leading organs are transformed into the reality of the masses' lives. From this point of view, it must be said that the Inner Mongolia Daily's grain requisition reports did not well fulfill its task. During the grain requisition work last year, the Inner Mongolia Daily published a total of fifteen news items related to grain requisition between October 8th and December 10th over two months. Among them, a total of four articles focused on the activities of the people: "Farmers in the Suburbs of Hohhot and Tumote Banner Actively Prepare to Send Patriotic Public Grain" on October 20th, "Grain Quality Inspector Liu Dianjiu" and "Grain Keeper Su Dezheng" on December 1st, and "Farmers in Chahar League Actively Pay and Sell Grain" on December 7th. The remaining eleven articles were all meeting and work news. This inevitably reduced the role of the newspaper's news reporting in educating and encouraging the people during the grain requisition. If the editorial department had not organized news reports on grain storage work in this way, but had observed more from the lives of the farmers, paying attention to the patriotic enthusiasm and socialist consciousness shown by the farmers under the leadership of the Party, and combined them with the Party's policies, then we would have obtained more news with the following content: farmers in a certain area have already started delivering grain; what actions have some advanced agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams taken to send good grain to the state; some farmers have added an extra ox and an extra stone of grain to their grain delivery carts, so the grain is delivered faster; many local people are filled with enthusiasm for supporting the liberation of Taiwan and building socialism when delivering public grain; some granary workers are actively trying to solve the problems of food and accommodation for grain-delivering farmers, and providing them with convenience in various ways, and so on. News reports composed of vivid and specific facts from the lives of the masses will naturally guide farmers to learn from advanced examples and improve their level of awareness. They will also educate state workers to cherish the patriotic enthusiasm of farmers and do their jobs well. If the news in the newspaper plays these roles among the masses, can it be considered that it is not promoting the work? The view that only reporting more on the activities of leading organs can play a guiding role in the work is one-sided.

Second, the basis of news reporting is facts. Everyone knows that the role of news is to mobilize, but it is a special kind of mobilization, which does not rely on argumentation, but on facts. Without facts, generally speaking, there is no news report. At the same time, the facts in news reports must be verified and accurate, otherwise they cannot truly play a mobilizing role. The news item "Hetao and Pingdi Quan Administrative Regions Fully Launch Grain Storage Work" in the Inner Mongolia Daily lacks a factual basis in some places. For example, the last paragraph of the news says:

"Because various regions have done a good job of preparatory work, the progress of grain storage work is faster than in previous years." Although some examples are listed later, these examples have not been compared with previous years, so they cannot support the editor's assertion and convince readers that it is indeed "faster than in previous years." Soviet news workers compare well-written news to swallows. The news does not need to say that spring is coming; people will know that spring is coming when they see swallows. But news that lacks a factual basis, even if it repeatedly tells people that spring is coming, may not be able to convince readers.

This news item not only lacks a factual basis in some places, but more seriously, it violates the truth of life in some places. For example, the second paragraph of the news writes: "Party and government leaders in various regions attach great importance to grain storage work." "Various regions" here of course refers to "various regions" in Hetao and Pingdi Quan Administrative Regions. However, just twenty days after this news was published (December 5th), a letter review entitled "Safety in Grain Delivery Must Be Ensured" published in the same newspaper pointed out: "Preventing casualties of people and animals and ensuring the safe storage of grain... Judging from recent letters, this issue has not yet received widespread attention in various regions." The review cited the following facts: Helingeer, Fengzhen, Qingshuihe, and Salachi counties in the Pingdi Quan Administrative Region, "started grain storage on November 5th. As of the 19th, in just fourteen days, there were six accidents involving casualties of people and animals, and seven accidents involving damaged vehicles." In addition, there was the case of Ren Haiyun, a farmer from Wudong County, who was delivering grain when his horse was startled and the cart ran over his chest; and the case of two children being run over by a grain delivery cart in Xinghe County, and so on. Originally, preventing casualties of people and animals and ensuring the safety of grain delivery is a very important aspect of doing a good job in grain storage. How can one think that "great importance is attached to grain storage work" if this point is ignored? It can be seen from this that the newspaper's indiscriminate praise of "Party and government leaders in various regions" in a "everything is fine" tone is one-sided and does not fully conform to the actual situation. Not only can this point be seen from this reader's letter review, but it can also be seen that the grain storage work in Pingdi Quan Administrative Region did not "fully start" in late October as stated in the news. At least, these four counties of Helingeer and so on only started this work on November 5th. Obviously, if the facts that constitute the basis of news reports are not true and reliable, then such news cannot encourage people or guide the work.

Third, news reports must be timely. This is a major feature of news reports and one of the most important requirements for news reports. However, the time when the Inner Mongolia Daily published "Hetao and Pingdi Quan Administrative Regions Fully Launch Grain Storage Work" shows that the editorial department did not pay attention to this feature and this requirement. If, according to what the news said, the grain storage work in these two administrative regions started in late October, then it was rather slow for the news reporting this matter to appear in the newspaper on November 14th. It is especially worth mentioning that the news also wrote:

"The Hetao Administrative Region is expected to complete the grain storage task by November 5th." Regardless of whether things were really like this (another news item published in the newspaper on December 5th indicated that this was not true), judging from this news itself, this means that the newspaper only "forecasted" the matter of November 5th on November 14th; and when the newspaper reported that the Hetao Administrative Region had "launched" grain storage work, this work had already ended nine days ago. This kind of late or outdated news naturally cannot play its role as well as those news items that timely reflect fresh things, and it is also not as popular. Examples like this are not isolated in the Inner Mongolia Daily. For example, the news "Jining County Gained Experience in Grain Purchase Pilot" published on November 21st was about things in September; the news published on December 8th that the Tugen Duan Railway Paving Project had been fully completed was about things in late October; the news published on December 9th that the Butha Banner held a three-level cadre meeting to arrange grain purchase work was about things on November 6th. Some local news published in the newspaper was even delayed by ten days. Soviet newspapers require that the news reported should be the most recent events. This requirement may not be fully achievable for us at present, but it is possible to achieve relatively timely news reporting through efforts. In the case of the Inner Mongolia Daily, 90% of the reporters have the conditions to send news telegrams, and it is also possible to achieve relatively timely news reporting. Some people regard timeliness as an unimportant technical issue. However, the value of news reporting is directly proportional to its strength in timeliness. Whether a news report is timely means whether or not the news report has any or how much value. If a news item tells people things they already know, or falls far behind life, then its value is questionable. Timeliness is a matter concerning the life of news reporting, is it just a technical issue?

From the news item "Hetao and Pingdi Quan Administrative Regions Fully Launch Grain Storage Work" published by the Inner Mongolia Daily (of course, not just this news item), it can be seen that the basic issues of news reporting, such as taking the activities of the people as the center, being based on facts, and striving for timeliness, have not been well resolved in the editorial department. Of course, these problems have not been well resolved not only in the Inner Mongolia Daily, but also in some other newspaper editorial departments. Therefore, in some newspapers, there are too many news items about how leading organs arrange, inspect, and summarize work, while the thoughts and emotions and practical actions of the people are not fully reflected in news reports; sometimes there are some reflections, but because they are in a supporting role rather than a leading role, their faces are unclear. In these newspapers, there are also too many comprehensive news items, which are characterized by concepts plus examples. Their reports on how the "whole region" and "various regions" are doing often lack sufficient and accurate factual basis; although there are some factual materials in some news items, they are drowned out by the large amount of argumentation by editors or reporters. As for outdated and old news, they are even more readily available. This cannot but affect the play of the role of news reporting as a special mobilizing weapon. These situations show that improving news reporting is still an important task for many newspapers today. Now the editorial department of the Inner Mongolia Daily has attached importance to this issue and organized the comrades of the editorial department to study and discuss the improvement of news reporting, which is very necessary. It is hoped that through this kind of inspection and study, people will be able to see many news items accurately, comprehensively, vividly, and timely reporting the actual lives of the people, reporting the implementation of the policies of the Party and the People's Government, and the specific achievements of various works. These news items will fully play the huge role of political mobilization with facts.

    从一条新闻谈起
    李道和
    去年十二月间，内蒙古日报编辑部在总结工作中曾着重地讨论过一条新闻：“河套和平地泉两行政区全面展开公粮入库工作”。在总结工作时，抓着一个重点，进行比较深入的检查和研究，以达到逐步改进和提高报纸工作的目的，这是值得各地报社学习的。
    内蒙古日报所检查的这条新闻发表在去年十一月十四日的报纸上，而且被放在一版头条的地位。新闻长约八百字，从党政领导机关对公粮入库工作的重视，谈到各地如何进行修桥补路等准备工作，组织群众运输力量，向农民进行爱国主义教育，最后谈到公粮入库的预计完成日期。乍看，这条新闻是有分量的。但是如果加以仔细分析，如果把它和实际生活、和报纸上发表的其他新闻联系起来研究，人们就会发现这条新闻存在着不少的问题，这些问题也反映出编辑部在组织新闻报道方面的缺点。
    首先，新闻报道的中心是什么？应该说，是人民群众的活动。人民群众是历史的真正创造者，他们的活动不能不构成我们新闻报道的中心。正如柯捷夫在“论新闻报道”一文中所指出的，“活生生的人物和他们奋不顾身的，英雄的劳动，及其爱国主义的首创精神和革新精神，应该成为新闻报道的中心。”分析“河套和平地泉两行政区全面展开公粮入库工作”这条新闻，它其实包含着这样一些内容：农民开始缴粮；政府修桥补路，便利农民送粮；农民同供销合作社订立运粮合同；农民把最好的粮食缴给国家；农民送粮比往年快，等等。这本来可以写成一些目的鲜明的、能够表现广大农民爱国热情的新闻。但是由于编辑没有明确认识新闻报道的中心应该是人民群众的活动，因此在处理这条新闻时，就从“公粮入库工作”的角度着眼，而不是从充分反映农民的缴粮和送粮活动着眼。这样，上述的农民群众积极缴粮和送粮的爱国行动，只是被当做领导机关的工作成绩泛泛地引证了一下。例如农民群众同国家订立运输合同、支援国家粮食调运的活动，在新闻中就成了“各地积极组织群众力量调运粮食”的注脚。不仅如此，广大农民特别是一些农业生产合作社和互助组积极缴粮送粮的许多生动事实，也因编辑热衷于概括工作面貌，而没有得到充分的表现或独立的处理。
    当然，新闻报道可以而且应该反映领导机关的活动，对于重要工作的进展情况也需要在适当时机加以综述，这些都是没有疑问的。但是报纸不能满足于此；它应该力求最充分地反映人民群众的活动，力求深刻地表现领导机关的要求怎样变为群众生活的实际。从这一点出发，不能不认为内蒙古日报的征粮报道没有很好地完成自己的任务。在去年征粮工作进行中，内蒙古日报由十月八日到十二月十日两个月中间一共发表了十五条有关征粮的新闻。其中以人民群众活动为中心的共有四篇，它们是：十月二十日的“呼和浩特郊区和土默特旗等地农民积极准备送缴爱国公粮”，十二月一日的“粮食检质员刘殿久”、“粮食保管员苏德政”和十二月七日的“察盟农民踊跃缴粮和卖粮”。其余十一篇全是会议和工作新闻。这就不能不降低了报纸的新闻报道在征粮中教育和鼓舞人民群众的作用。如果编辑部不是这样组织公粮入库的新闻报道，而是更多地从农民群众的生活中进行观察，注意农民群众在党的领导下所表现的爱国热情和社会主义觉悟，并且把它们同党的政策结合起来，那我们就会得到更多的如下内容的新闻：某一地区的农民已经开始送粮；一些先进的农业生产合作社和互助组采取了怎样的行动把好粮送给国家；有些农民在送粮车上多套了一头牛，多装了一石粮，所以粮食送得快了；许多地方群众在送公粮时充满着支援解放台湾和建设社会主义的热情；一些粮库工作人员积极设法解决送粮农民的食宿等问题，从多方面给农民以方便，等等。由群众生活中生动具体的事实所构成的新闻报道，自然会引导农民向先进的榜样去学习，提高农民的觉悟程度。它们同样也会教育国家工作人员珍视农民的爱国热情，做好自己的工作。如果报纸上的新闻在群众中起到这些作用，能够认为它没有推动工作么？那种认为只有多报道领导机关的活动才能够对工作起指导作用的看法是片面的。
    其次，新闻报道的基础是事实。大家知道，新闻的作用是鼓动，但它是一种特殊的鼓动，这种鼓动不凭借于议论，而凭借于事实。没有事实，一般说来也就没有新闻报道。同时新闻报道中的事实必须是经过检验的，准确无误的，否则也就不能真正发挥鼓动作用。内蒙古日报的这条“河套和平地泉两行政区全面展开公粮入库工作”的新闻，有些地方却缺乏事实的基础。例如新闻的最后一段说：
  “各地因为做好了准备工作，所以公粮入库工作的进度都较往年快。”虽然后面列举了一些例子，但是这些例子都不曾和往年做过比较，因此并不能支持编辑的论断，使读者相信确实“比往年快”。苏联的新闻工作者把写得好的新闻比做燕子，新闻中不必说春天来了，人们看到燕子就会知道春天来了。可是缺乏事实基础的新闻，尽管它一再告诉人们春天来了，却不一定能够说服读者。
    这条新闻不仅有些地方缺乏事实的基础，更严重的是有些地方违背了生活的真实。例如新闻的第二段写道：“各地党政领导对公粮入库工作极为重视”。这个“各地”当然是指河套和平地泉两行政区的“各地”。但是就在这条新闻发表后的二十天（十二月五日），同一报纸发表的一篇“必须做好安全送粮工作”的来信述评，却指出：“防止人畜伤亡保证粮食安全入库，……从最近的来信中看，这一问题还没有引起各地普遍重视”。述评引证了如下的事实：平地泉行政区的和林格尔、丰镇、清水河、萨拉齐等县，“从十一月五日开始公粮入库，截至十九日，仅在十四天的时间内，就发生人畜伤亡事故六起，损坏车辆事故七起”。此外，还有武东县农民任海云送粮，归途马惊了，车从他胸部轧过，兴和县送粮车轧坏了两个小孩等等。本来防止人畜伤亡，保证送粮的安全，是做好公粮入库工作的一个十分重要的方面。忽视了这一点，怎能认为“对公粮入库工作极为重视”呢？由此可见，报纸用那种“万事大吉”的语调不加分别地对“各地党政领导”所作的表扬是片面的，不完全符合实际情况的。从这一篇读者来信述评中不但可以看出这一点，而且可以看出平地泉行政区的公粮入库工作并非如新闻中所说在十月下旬“全面开始”，至少有和林格尔等四个县是十一月五日才开始这一工作。显而易见，构成新闻报道基础的事实如果不是真实可靠的，那么这样的新闻是既不能鼓舞人们又不能指导工作的。
    第三，新闻报道必须及时。这是新闻报道的一个主要特点，也是对于新闻报道的最重要的要求之一。但是内蒙古日报发表“河套和平地泉两行政区全面展开公粮入库工作”的时间，表明编辑部没有重视这个特点和这个要求。如果按照新闻中所说，这两个行政区的公粮入库工作是在十月下旬开始的，那么报道这事的新闻在十一月十四日才见报就未免迟缓了。特别值得提出的是，新闻中还写道：
  “河套行政区预计在十一月五日前，公粮入库任务可全部完成”。姑不论事情是否真是这样（十二月五日报纸发表的另一条新闻说明这不是真实的），单从这条新闻本身来看，这就是说，报纸在十一月十四日才“预告”十一月五日的事情；而当报纸报道河套行政区“展开”公粮入库工作时，这个工作已经结束九天了。这种迟到的或过时的新闻自然不可能如同那些及时地反映新鲜事物的新闻同样发挥它的作用，同样受到人们的欢迎。类似这种例子，在内蒙古日报还不是个别的。例如十一月二十一日发表的“集宁县在征购粮试点中取得经验”的新闻，内容是九月的事；十二月八日发表的图根段铁路铺轨工程已全部完成的新闻，内容是十月下旬的事；十二月九日发表的布特哈旗召开三级干部会议布置征购粮工作的新闻，内容是十一月六日的事。报上发表的某些本市新闻，甚至也有迟至十天的。苏联的报纸要求新闻所报道的是最近发生的事情。这个要求对于我们来说目前也许不能完全达到，但是只要经过努力，求得新闻报道的比较及时却是可能的。就以内蒙古日报的情况来说，记者中百分之九十有拍发新闻电报的条件，要做到新闻报道的比较及时也是可能的。有人把时间性看成一个无关紧要的技术性问题。但是新闻报道的价值大小是同它的时间性强弱成正比例的。新闻报道是否及时，意味着新闻报道有没有或有多大存在的价值。如果一篇新闻告诉人们的是他们早已知道的事情，或者远远落在生活的后面，那么它的存在价值就值得怀疑了。时间性是一个关乎新闻报道的生命的问题，难道只是一个技术性问题么？
    从内蒙古日报发表的“河套和平地泉两行政区全面展开公粮入库工作”这条新闻（当然不止这条新闻），可以看出新闻报道应该以人民群众的活动为中心、应该以事实为基础、应该争取时效性这些基本问题在编辑部还没有得到很好的解决。当然，这些问题不仅在内蒙古日报，就是在其他一些报纸编辑部也没有得到很好的解决。因此，在有些报纸上就出现了过多的领导机关如何布置、检查、总结工作的新闻，而人民群众的思想情绪和实际行动在新闻报道中却没有得到充分的反映；有时虽然也有一些反映，但因为是居于配角的地位，而不是主角的地位，所以面目不清。在这些报纸上也就出现了过多的综合新闻，这些新闻的特点是概念加例子，它们所报道的“全区”“各地”如何如何，往往缺乏足够的、准确的事实基础；有些新闻中虽然也有一些事实材料，但却被编辑或记者的大量议论淹没了。至于过时的陈旧的新闻，更是俯拾皆是。这就不能不影响到新闻报道这种特殊的鼓动武器的作用的发挥。这些情况说明了，改进新闻报道对于不少报纸来说，还是当前的一个重要课题。现在内蒙古日报编辑部已经重视了这个问题，组织编辑部同志进行了改进新闻报道的学习和讨论，这是很有必要的。希望经过这种检查和学习，人们能够看到报纸上出现许多准确地、多方面地、生动地、及时地报道人民的实际生活，报道党和人民政府的政策实施情况和各种工作具体成就的新闻，这些新闻将充分发挥以事实进行政治鼓动的巨大作用。
