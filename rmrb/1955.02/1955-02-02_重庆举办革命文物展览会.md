A revolutionary cultural relics exhibition organized by the Chongqing Southwest Museum opened on January 23rd. On display were more than 290 revolutionary cultural relics left behind by the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army when it passed through northern Guizhou and southern Sichuan from the end of 1934 to the beginning of 1935, as well as revolutionary cultural relics from the old base areas of Sichuan and Shaanxi.

Of the exhibits, particularly noteworthy were the photographs of the meeting site where the CPC Central Committee held an enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau in Zunyi Old Town in January 1935, and the photographs of the houses where Chairman Mao Zedong and Vice Chairman Zhu De lived during the "Zunyi Conference," photographs of the Jiangjie River and Jingkou ferry crossings where the Red Army daringly crossed the Wujiang River twenty years ago, and battlefield photographs of the battles of Loushan Pass, Chishui River, and Fuxingchang. Also on display were physical objects used by the Red Army in battles, such as steel vests (containing iron sand), rifles, bugle scores, sabers, bamboo shoulder poles, kerosene lamps, and hand grenades made by the Jiangxi Soviet area arsenal engraved with five-pointed stars, axes, and sickles. Also on display were: the Outline of the Constitution of the Chinese Soviet Republic adopted by the Second National Soviet Congress in January 1934, a proclamation issued by Li Fuchun, acting director of the General Political Department of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in January 1935, large wooden slogan posters and propaganda paintings written by the Red Army in Zunyi, Maotai, Gulin and other places, such as "Only the Soviets can save China," and various rice tickets, grain loan certificates, public bonds, and currencies of the Red Army. Among the revolutionary cultural relics from the Sichuan-Shaanxi base areas on display were various decrees and land use certificates issued by the Soviet government at that time, Red Army soldier reading materials, as well as leaflets and victory reports on the annihilation of Chiang bandit troops at that time, and a battle flag of the 25th Division of the Red Army embroidered with "Workers of all countries, unite!"

In order to preserve these precious revolutionary cultural relics, the people of Sichuan and Guizhou carried out heroic struggles. Xie Jincheng, a bugler of the 7th Regiment of the 3rd Division of the 9th Army of the Red Army, who is now in Gulin County, southern Sichuan, risked his life to preserve a bugle score of the Red Army after being wounded twice in the battles of crossing the Wujiang River and Qingkangpo. Li Yuanfeng, the former director of the Anti-Tax Committee of Meitan County, northern Guizhou, was given a copper ink box when the Red Army withdrew. Later, white bandits ransacked his home and his son was killed, but even at this critical moment of life and death, he took the ink box with him. For twenty years, this ink box has never left his side.

    重庆举办革命文物展览会
    重庆西南博物院举办的川黔革命文物展览会在一月二十三日开幕。会上展出的除一九三四年底至一九三五年初，中国工农红军经过黔北、川南时遗留的二百九十多件革命文物外，还有川陕老根据地的革命文物。
    展出文物中，特别令人注目的是，一九三五年一月中共中央在遵义老城内举行政治局扩大会议的会议地址照片和毛泽东主席、朱德副主席在“遵义会议”时所住过的房屋的照片，二十年前，红军抢渡乌江天险的江界河、菁口渡口的照片，以及娄山关、赤水河、复兴场等战斗的战地照片。红军在战斗中使用的钢背心（内装铁沙）、步枪、军号谱、马刀、竹扁担、马灯和江西苏区兵工厂制造的镌有五星、斧头、镰刀的手榴弹等实物也在会上展出。在会上展出的还有：一九三四年一月第二次全国苏维埃代表大会通过的中华苏维埃共和国宪法大纲，一九三五年一月中国工农红军总政治部代主任李富春颁发的布告，红军在遵义、茅台、古蔺等地书写的“只有苏维埃才能救中国”等木牌大标语、宣传画，红军的各种米票、借谷证、公债券、货币等。展出的川陕根据地革命文物中，除有当时苏维埃政府颁发的各种法令、土地使用证、红军战士读物外，还有当时消灭蒋匪军的传单、捷报和红军第二十五师缀有“全世界无产阶级联合起来”的一面战斗的军旗。
    为保存这些珍贵的革命文物，川黔人民曾进行了英勇的斗争。现留在川南古蔺县的红军第九军团第三师第七团司号员谢金澄同志，在抢渡乌江和青扛坡战斗中两次负伤后，冒着生命危险保存了红军的一本军号谱。黔北湄潭县原抗捐委员会主任李元凤，红军撤离时曾赠他一个铜墨盒，后来白匪抄了他家，儿子也被杀了，就在这生死关头他也把墨盒带走了。二十年来，这墨盒一直没离开他的身边。
