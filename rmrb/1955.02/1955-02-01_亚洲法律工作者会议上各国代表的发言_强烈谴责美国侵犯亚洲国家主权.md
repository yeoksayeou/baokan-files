Xinhua News Agency, Calcutta, January 31st: The Asian Legal Workers Conference continued on the 29th. Representatives from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, India, and China spoke at the meeting on the 29th.

Kim Ik-seon, head of the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, condemned the United States for organizing the Manila military bloc, actively plotting to arm Japan, and concluding the US-Chiang treaty in his speech. Kim Ik-seon said that the purpose of concluding the US-Chiang treaty was to conspire to legalize the United States' occupation of Taiwan, a Chinese territory, and to use Taiwan as a base for expanding aggression against the Chinese mainland. Kim Ik-seon then pointed out that the United States is undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement and inciting the Syngman Rhee group to openly prepare to re-launch an attack on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Kim Ik-seon emphasized that the issue of Korean reunification should be resolved by the Korean people themselves.

Ho Dac Di, head of the delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, said in his speech that the Vietnamese people, having endured nearly a century of foreign rule, have understood the value of the principle of national sovereignty, and therefore most strongly condemn the United States for undermining the Geneva Accords through the Manila Treaty. He said that the US imperialists, in close cooperation with Ngo Dinh Diem and certain French colonialists, are using every means to undermine the upcoming Vietnamese general election. The US imperialists' undermining of the Geneva Accords is not an isolated fact, but an action taken in accordance with a US-planned scheme to undermine peace.

Kudryavtsev, head of the Soviet delegation, accused the United States at the meeting of undermining the Soviet Union's efforts to prohibit the testing of nuclear weapons in Asia or any region of the world. He also said: The Manila Treaty Organization is a new military bloc that threatens the national independence of Asian countries and the freedom of the Pacific region. He also said that if everyone works together to strive for peace, there will be peace in the world. No one can stop mankind from achieving peace.

S. Chaudhuri, a well-known Indian lawyer, gave a report on the issue of national sovereignty to the conference. He said: "All countries, large and small, have sovereignty free from any interference by any other country in their internal affairs. This is the basic principle of international law that all legal workers should strive to establish. We believe that world peace should not be disturbed."

Another Indian representative, A. K. Dutta, in his speech, accused the United States of interfering in China's sovereignty by not recognizing China's rights to Taiwan. Dutta demanded that the People's Republic of China be admitted to the United Nations in accordance with all the provisions of the law and the purposes declared in the United Nations Charter itself.

Zhang Zhiran, head of the delegation of the Chinese Political Science and Law Association, gave a report on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence at the meeting. He said that China has an unwavering determination to liberate Taiwan, and any foreign interference is intolerable. He emphasized: "Any act of interference by the United States government in this matter will be a criminal act in violation of international law, because China's liberation of Taiwan (which has been Chinese territory since ancient times) is China's sovereignty and internal affair."

Zhang Zhiran then said that Taiwan is an inseparable part of mainland China, and this status has been repeatedly affirmed by solemn international agreements such as the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the Japanese Instrument of Surrender. He pointed out that talk of "neutralizing" Taiwan or placing Taiwan under UN "trusteeship" is absurd.

Zhang Zhiran welcomed the upcoming Asian-African Conference, saying that the initiation of such a conference by the Prime Ministers of the Colombo countries reflected the sincere desire of the people of all Asian countries to promote the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Zhang Zhiran said that fundamental and historically significant changes have taken place in most parts of Asia, and the people of this region will never tolerate others deciding their fate. The real purpose of the US aggressive bloc organizing the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is to establish new colonial rule in Asia.

Zhang Zhiran also said that Asian legal workers have played a brilliant role in the lofty cause of opposing colonialism and defending national independence and sovereignty, as well as maintaining international peace and security. He believes that Asian legal workers will certainly be able to continue to bravely shoulder this glorious and sacred responsibility in the future, to defend the independence and sovereignty of their motherlands, and to promote peaceful coexistence and collective security among Asian countries and the world.

    亚洲法律工作者会议上各国代表的发言
    强烈谴责美国侵犯亚洲国家主权
    【新华社加尔各答三十一日电】亚洲法律工作者会议二十九日继续举行。在二十九日会议上发言的有朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国、苏联、印度和中国的代表。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团团长金益善在发言中谴责美国组织马尼拉军事集团，积极阴谋武装日本并缔结美蒋条约。金益善说，缔结美蒋条约的目的就是阴谋使美国对中国领土台湾的占领合法化，并利用台湾作为对中国大陆扩大侵略的一个基地。金益善接着指出，美国正在破坏朝鲜停战协定，并煽动李承晚集团公开地准备向朝鲜民主主义人民共和国重新发动进攻。金益善强调指出，朝鲜的统一问题应该由朝鲜人民自己来解决。
    越南民主共和国代表团团长胡得怡在发言中说，越南人民经受过将近一世纪的外国统治，已经懂得国家主权原则的可贵，因而就最强烈地谴责美国通过马尼拉条约破坏日内瓦协定。他说，美帝国主义者在同吴庭艳和某些法国殖民主义者密切合作下，正利用一切办法破坏即将到来的越南普选。美帝国主义者破坏日内瓦协定并不是孤立的事实，而是根据美国策划的破坏和平计划而采取的行动。
    苏联代表团团长库德里雅夫采夫在会上指责美国破坏苏联关于禁止在亚洲或世界任何地区试验核子武器的努力。他又说：马尼拉条约组织是一个威胁亚洲各国的民族独立和太平洋地区的自由的新的军事集团。他又说，如果所有的人都一致努力为争取和平而奋斗，世界上就会有和平。任何人也不能阻碍人类获得和平。
    印度名律师萨·乔杜里向会议作了关于国家主权问题的报告。他说：“一切大小国家都有不受任何其他国家对自己内政的任何干涉的主权，这是一切法律工作者应当努力建立的国际法的基本原则。我们认为，世界和平不应受到干扰。”
    另一位印度代表阿·克·杜塔在发言中指责美国不承认中国对台湾的权利，是对中国主权的干涉。杜塔要求，按照法律的一切规定和联合国宪章本身所宣布过的目的接纳中华人民共和国进入联合国。
    中国政治法律学会代表团团长张志让在会上做了关于和平共处五项原则的报告。他说，中国有坚定不移的决心要解放台湾，任何外国的干涉都是不能容忍的。他着重地说：“美国政府对于这件事的任何干涉行动，都将是违反国际法的犯罪行为，因为中国解放台湾（它从古以来就是中国的领土）是中国的主权和内政。”
    张志让接着说，台湾是中国大陆的一个不可分割的部分，这种地位已经一再为开罗宣言，波茨坦公告及日本投降条款等庄严的国际协议所肯定。他指出，像将台湾“中立化”或是将台湾交由联合国“托管”之类的说法都是荒谬的。
    张志让欢迎即将召开的亚非会议说，科伦坡国家总理们发起召开这样的一个会议反映了所有亚洲国家的人民促进和平共处的五项原则的真诚愿望。张志让说，亚洲大部分地区已经发生了具有历史意义的基本变化，这个地区的人民决不容忍别人来决定他们的命运。美国侵略集团组织东南亚条约组织的真正目的是要在亚洲建立起新的殖民统治。
    张志让又说，亚洲的法律工作者们在反对殖民主义，捍卫民族独立和主权，以及维护国际和平和安全的崇高事业中曾经发挥过光辉的作用。他相信亚洲法律工作者们今后也一定能够继续勇敢地担负起这一光荣而神圣的职责，来捍卫祖国的独立和主权，并促进亚洲及世界各国间的和平共处和集体安全。
