Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 6th: According to the Vietnam News Agency, as the "1955 Spring Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign" is about to officially begin on February 10th, Chairman Ho Chi Minh has issued a message to the people and cadres of all regions. The purpose of this movement is to increase the yield of agricultural products, thereby promoting the restoration and development of production in 1955.

The message first mentioned the achievements of the Vietnamese people in increasing production and practicing economy during the patriotic war. The message then said: Now that peace has been restored, campaigns to mobilize the peasant masses to reduce rent and interest or carry out land reform have been carried out in many areas. These constitute favorable conditions for agricultural development.

However, many difficulties can still be seen: There may be droughts, floods, and insect pests damaging crops; a considerable number of barren lands have not yet been reclaimed; irrigation systems have not yet been completed. Therefore, the glorious task of the Vietnamese people at present is to carry out a competition to restore and develop agricultural production, so as to ensure that farmers are happy, the army gets food, urban areas get supplies, and the country's reconstruction work is advanced.

The message said: This spring, all our farmers should compete to plant more rice and secondary crops; cultivate deeply and carefully, weed and fertilize; prevent drought and flood, eliminate pests; reclaim wasteland; raise a large number of livestock; and practice economy in all aspects.

The message pointed out: This is a patriotic competition movement of great significance. I call on compatriots to actively participate in this movement. By doing so, you will contribute to the struggle to consolidate peace, achieve unification, and complete national independence and democracy.

The message concluded: The government will reward individuals or units and working cadres who have made outstanding achievements this spring.

    胡志明主席号召展开增产节约竞赛运动
    【新华社六日讯】　据越南通讯社河内五日讯：在“一九五五年春季增产节约竞赛运动”即将在二月十日正式开始的时候，胡志明主席向各个地区的人民和干部发表了文告。这个运动的目的在于提高农产品的产量，借以促进一九五五年的生产的恢复和发展。
    文告首先提到越南人民在爱国战争期间增产节约的竞赛成就，文告接着说：现在，和平已经恢复了，在许多地区进行了发动农民群众进行减租减息或土地改革的运动。这些都构成了农业发展的有利条件。
    但是还可以看到许多困难：可能有干旱、洪水和虫害损害收成；有亩数相当多的荒地还没有开垦；灌溉系统还没有完成。因此越南人民目前的光荣任务就是进行竞赛，以恢复和发展农业生产，借以保证农民们得到幸福，军队得到粮食，都市地区得到供应，并且推进国家的重建工作。
    文告说：今年春天我们所有的农民都应该进行竞赛以种植更多的稻子和副作物；深耕细作，除草施肥；防旱防涝，消灭害虫；开垦荒地；饲养大批的家畜；从各方面实行节约。
    文告指出：这是一个具有重大意义的爱国主义竞赛运动。我号召同胞们积极参加这个运动。你们这样做，就将对巩固和平、实现统一和完成全国的独立和民主的斗争作出贡献。
    文告最后说：政府将奖励那些在今年春天取得卓越成就的个人或单位及工作干部。
