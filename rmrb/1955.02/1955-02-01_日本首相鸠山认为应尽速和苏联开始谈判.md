Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 31st: Following the statement by Domnitsky, head of the Soviet delegation in Tokyo, on behalf of the Soviet government regarding the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations, Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama said at a press conference on the 30th that he considered the Soviet representative's statement to be "formal and official," and that it "represented the will of the Soviet government." He said that both he and Sugihara Arata, chairman of the Democratic Party's Foreign Affairs Committee, believed that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be instructed to prepare to begin negotiations with the Soviet government "as quickly as possible." Hatoyama Ichiro also said that the idea that negotiations could only begin after resolving the territorial issues of Habomai and Shikotan Islands was "putting the cart before the horse."

The day before Hatoyama's statement, Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu said at a press conference that he considered the statement made by Domnitsky on instructions from the Soviet government to be an "unofficial notification," and he advocated that "all issues should be resolved before any negotiations to end the state of war are conducted." According to Kyodo News Agency on the 31st, some cabinet members and leaders of the ruling Democratic Party were "dissatisfied with Shigemitsu's hesitant attitude in adjusting relations with the Soviet Union and Communist China. They criticized his 'do-nothing' policy toward the Soviet Union, presumably because he personally feared that any rapid action taken by the government at this time might worsen relations between Japan and the United States. This criticism became louder last week when he expressed conspicuously negative views towards Soviet suggestions."

Now, "Tokyo Shimbun" and some other newspapers are also asking the Hatoyama government to clarify this "two-door diplomacy."

    日本首相鸠山认为应尽速和苏联开始谈判
    【新华社三十一日讯】东京消息：在苏联驻东京代表团团长多穆尼茨基代表苏联政府发表了关于苏日关系正常化的声明以后，日本首相鸠山一郎在三十日的记者招待会上说：他认为苏联代表的声明是“正式的和官方的”，它“代表了苏联政府的意愿”。他说，他和日本民主党外交委员会主席杉原荒太都认为应当训令外务省准备“尽可能快地”和苏联政府开始谈判。鸠山一郎还说，所谓要在解决了齿舞和色丹岛的领土问题以后才能开始谈判的说法是“把马车套在马前面”。
    在鸠山发表这个谈话的前一天，日本外务相重光葵曾在记者招待会上说，他认为多穆尼茨基奉苏联政府的指示发表的声明是一个“非官方的通知”，他主张“在进行任何结束战争状态的谈判以前，应当先把一切问题都解决”。据共同社三十一日说，一些内阁阁员和执政的民主党领袖“不满重光在调整同苏联和共产党中国的关系上裹足不前的态度。他们批评他对苏联的‘什么事也不做’的政策，大概是因为他个人害怕政府在这个时候采取任何急速的行动可能会使日美之间的关系恶化，这种批评在上星期当他对苏联建议表现得突出地消极的时候，是变得更响亮了”。
    现在，“东京新闻”和其他一些报纸也要求鸠山政府澄清这种“两个大门的外交”。
