Hurry Up and Do a Good Job of "Providing Charcoal in the Snow"
Jiang Chun

The People's Government, concerned about the difficulties of farmers in disaster areas, has successively allocated a large amount of production and disaster relief loans since the autumn of last year to help disaster victims overcome the disaster and restore production.

Most regional leading organs, after receiving the production and disaster relief loans, immediately distributed them to the disaster victims. However, some regional leading organs did not pay enough attention to the distribution of production and disaster relief loans, accumulating them at each level, deducting them step by step, and failing to distribute them to the disaster victims in a timely manner.

Some cadres said, "It's easy to issue loans, but difficult to collect them," "Less lending, less trouble," so they are unwilling to issue loans; they are even more unwilling to continue lending to disaster areas where past agricultural loans have not been fully recovered. They are concerned about the difficulties and ease, smoothness and trouble of their own work, and are indifferent to helping disaster victims restore production, especially to overcome special difficulties in life. They have long abandoned their mass perspective and are increasingly distant from the poor farmers. They should quickly wake up and use loans as weapons to help disaster victims implement self-reliance through production.

Some cadres think, "Everyone suffered the same disaster, so why distinguish who should get a loan and who shouldn't?" These people do not seriously investigate the difficulties and urgent needs of disaster-stricken households, and instead implement an average loan distribution method, so that difficult households that should have received more loans received less, or even none at all; while some households that did not need loans originally received them. In this way, although the loans were issued, the difficult farmers remained in difficulty, and the non-difficult farmers wasted the loans at will, eating and drinking excessively, and even gambling. This practice not only wasted the state's precious funds, but also created a very bad influence.

Organizing disaster victims to engage in production and self-reliance through loans is an important political task. If this work is done well, it will promote agricultural production and prevent the possible spring famine this spring; if it is not done well, it will inevitably undermine the confidence of farmers in overcoming disasters and bring difficulties to this year's agricultural production.

The State Bank and district and township cadres must overcome various incorrect views in lending, establish a working style of caring about the suffering of the masses and going deep and meticulous, and distribute production and disaster relief loans to the disaster victims in a timely and correct manner, truly achieving the goal of "providing charcoal in the snow."

    赶快做好“雪里送炭”的工作
    江春
    人民政府关怀灾区农民的困难，从去年秋季开始，陆续拨下大批生产救灾贷款，帮助灾民克服灾荒，恢复生产。
    多数地区的领导机关，领到生产救灾贷款以后，立即发放到灾民手中。但有部分地区的领导机关，对发放生产救灾贷款不加重视，层层积压，步步克扣，不能及时发放到灾民手中。
    有些干部说：“放款容易收款难”“少放少麻烦”，所以不愿意放款；他们对过去的农业贷款还没有全部收回的灾区，更加不愿意继续贷款。他们关心的是自己的工作的困难和容易，顺利和麻烦，而对帮助灾民恢复生产，首先是克服生活上的特殊困难无动于衷。他们的群众观点早丢掉了，和贫苦农民的距离是越来越远了，他们应该赶快清醒过来，用贷款作武器帮助灾民实行生产自救。
    有些干部认为：“受的都是一样的灾，分什么该贷款不该贷款呢？”这些人不去认真调查受灾户的困难和迫切的需要，竟实行平均贷放的办法，以致应该多贷款的困难户贷少了，甚至根本没有贷到；某些本来不需要贷款的户却得到了贷款。这样，贷款虽然发下去了，但困难的农民仍然困难，不困难的农民就任意浪费贷款，大吃大喝，甚至赌博。这种做法，不仅浪费了国家的宝贵资金，而且造成了极坏的影响。
    通过贷款组织灾民生产自救，是一项重要的政治任务。这一工作做好了，就会推动农业生产，防止今春可能发生的春荒；如果做不好，必然打击农民战胜灾害的信心，给今年的农业生产带来困难。
    国家银行和区乡干部必须克服贷款中的各种不正确的观点，树立起关心群众疾苦和深入细致的工作作风，把生产救灾贷款及时而正确地发放到灾民手中，真正达到“雪里送炭”的目的。
