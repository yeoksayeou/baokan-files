    The power of state-owned commerce and cooperatives in Wuhan to lead the market has been significantly strengthened, and the organized market is gradually expanding. Dozens of state-owned stores and wholesale departments in the city regularly stock ample goods to facilitate purchases by private merchants. Nine-tenths of the city's private retailers now purchase goods from state-owned stores. Last year, all private grain, cooking oil, and cotton cloth stores retailed and acted as agents for state-owned commercial goods; all or most of the private department stores, pharmacies, paint stores, hardware stores, electrical supply stores, tobacco and liquor stores, coal stores, aquatic product stores, and pork stores also purchased or retailed goods from state-owned commerce. Since last year, state-owned commerce has also led private stores in twenty-one industries to implement negotiated and verified pricing systems for more than 860 major commodities, curbing and cracking down on the speculative activities of private capitalist commerce. Last summer and autumn, when floods besieged Wuhan, prices in the city remained stable as usual. Before the Spring Festival this year, the Wuhan area experienced two cold waves and heavy snowstorms, making procurement and transportation very difficult, but state-owned commerce supplied the city's people with more than 20% more staple and non-staple foods for the festival than last year, with some foods increasing twelvefold.

    Spring has just arrived, and Sichuan Province's state-owned commercial departments have already prepared a large quantity of spring and summer supplies for the people of the entire province. As of early February, the China National Merchandise Corporation's Chengdu Procurement and Supply Station alone had transferred 1,500 tons of spring and summer supplies to Wenjiang, Suining, Leshan and other special districts within the province. The China National Cotton Yarn and Fabric Corporation's Sichuan Provincial Company's cotton cloth inventory in January this year was more than ten times higher than in the same period last year. The shelves of supply and marketing cooperatives in rural areas are now filled with newly arrived goods.
    From the sales statistics of state-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives, it can be seen that the materials supplied by the state to the people of Sichuan have increased year by year. For example, if the number of cotton cloths sold by state-owned commercial departments within the province in 1952 is taken as 100, it was 188.5 in 1953 and 477 in 1954. In terms of non-staple foods, the amount of pork supplied by supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the province in 1954 increased more than threefold compared with 1953. Because the state has a sufficient grasp of materials, it has basically satisfied the ever-increasing needs of the people of the entire province in recent years, and prices throughout the province have been stable since April 1950.

    武汉国营商业领导市场的力量显著加强
    四川国营商业部门供应人民的物资逐年增长
    武汉市国营商业和合作社领导市场的力量显著加强，有组织的市场正在逐步扩大。全市数十个国营商店批发部经常储备充裕的商品，便利私商采购。全市已有十分之九的私营零售商向国营商店采购商品。去年，全部私营粮食、食油、棉布商店都为国营商业经销和代销商品：全部或绝大部分的私营百货、医药、颜料、五金、电料、烟酒、煤炭、水产和猪肉商店，也批购或经销国营商业的商品。从去年起，国营商业还领导二十一个行业的私营商店，实行了八百六十多种主要商品的议价、核价管理制度，制止和打击了私人资本主义商业的投机活动。去年夏秋两季，当洪水围困武汉市区时，全市物价平稳如常。今年春节前夕，武汉地区曾遭遇两次寒潮和大风雪，采购和运输十分困难，但国营商业供应全市人民过节的主食品和副食品比去年春节增加了百分之二十以上，有的食品增加到十二倍。

    春天刚刚来临，四川省国营商业部门已为全省人民准备好了大批的春、夏季用品。到二月上旬止，仅中国百货公司成都采购供应站调到省内温江、遂宁、乐山等专区的春、夏季用品，就有一千五百吨。中国花纱布公司四川省公司今年一月份的棉布库存量，比去年同期增加十倍以上。现在在各地农村供销合作社的货架上，已摆满了新到的商品。
    从国营商业部门和供销合作社的销售统计表里，可以看到国家供应四川人民的物资逐年增长的情形。如以一九五二年全省国营商业部门省内销售的棉布数字为一百，一九五三年为一百八十八点五，一九五四年则为四百七十七。在副食品方面，一九五四年全省各供销合作社供应的猪肉，比一九五三年增加三倍以上。由于国家掌握了充足的物资，几年来基本上满足了全省人民日益增长的需要，全省物价自一九五零年四月以来，一直是平稳的。
