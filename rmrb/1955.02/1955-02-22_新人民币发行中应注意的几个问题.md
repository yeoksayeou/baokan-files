To help the general public understand the specific issues related to the issuance of the new currency, we will now provide a simple explanation of the following main issues.

	I. Exchange Rate Between New and Old Currency
	The State Council has decided to issue a new Renminbi (referred to as the new currency) from March 1, 1955, and gradually withdraw the currently circulating Renminbi (referred to as the old currency). The new currency has eleven denominations, including five main currencies: one yuan, two yuan, three yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan, and six auxiliary currencies: one jiao, two jiao, five jiao, one fen, two fen, and five fen.
	The State Council stipulates that one yuan of the new currency is equal to ten thousand yuan of the old currency. Based on this ratio, one jiao of the new currency is equal to one thousand yuan of the old currency, one fen of the new currency is equal to one hundred yuan of the old currency, and so on.

	II. Why Are There Two-Yuan and Three-Yuan Denominations in the New Currency?
	The benefit of having two-yuan and three-yuan denominations in the new currency is to facilitate payment and receipt and save on banknotes. For example, when paying three yuan, if there is no three-yuan note, it is necessary to use one one-yuan note and one two-yuan note, or three one-yuan notes to make up three yuan. Or, when paying eight yuan, if there is no three-yuan note, it is necessary to use one five-yuan note, one two-yuan note, and one one-yuan note to make up eight yuan; with a three-yuan note, only one five-yuan note and one three-yuan note are needed. In this way, one banknote can be saved per transaction. By analogy, payments involving "three" or "eight" can save at least one banknote.

	III. Conversion Procedures for Savings Certificates, Public Bonds, etc.
	From March 1st, all transactions, calculations, and currency receipts and payments will be denominated in the new currency. All contracts, agreements, receipts, vouchers, account books, and records must be calculated in the new currency. All creditor-debtor relationships prior to the issuance of the new currency will also be converted into the new currency for calculation and settlement from March 1st according to the statutory ratio. All contracts, vouchers, etc., concluded before March 1, 1955, will be converted into the new currency according to the statutory ratio from March 1st, regardless of whether they have undergone conversion procedures on the documents. All government agencies, organizations, and public and private enterprises that have business dealings with banks, whether deposits or loans, will have their accounts converted by the bank, which will then issue a statement. Each unit will check and endorse the statement and return it to the bank within a certain period of time.
	Those who hold IOUs for loans from banks that have not yet expired or been repaid, fixed-term and current savings certificates and passbooks at the bank, People's Victory Inflation-Indexed Bonds issued by the state in 1950, and Economic Construction Bonds issued in 1954 do not need to go to the bank to carry out conversion procedures. The IOUs can be converted at the statutory rate when the loan expires and is repaid, the public bonds can be converted when the principal and interest are repaid, and the savings certificates and passbooks can be converted when they expire or are withdrawn.

	IV. Matters Needing Attention During the Exchange
	After the new currency is issued, the state will recover all the old currency according to the statutory ratio. The state has two methods for recovering the old currency: one is through the business of various state-owned enterprises, cooperatives, and banks, where the old currency is recovered and no longer paid out; this is the main method. The other is through exchange by the People's Bank of China. Therefore, everyone can use the old currency to buy things, save money, pay taxes, or go to the bank to exchange it for the new currency.
	The state stipulates that large denominations of ten thousand yuan and fifty thousand yuan of the old currency will only be in circulation until March 31, 1955, but can still be exchanged at the People's Bank of China before April 30th. Therefore, everyone should first exchange the old currency of ten thousand yuan and fifty thousand yuan into new currency within the specified time. As for the small denominations of five thousand yuan and below, the circulation time will be longer, and the date for stopping the exchange will be determined separately based on the exchange situation without affecting the normal economic life of the people. In short, the government will definitely be responsible for recovering all the old currency at the specified ratio, so people with old currency in hand should not panic, do not engage in runs, and do not rush to purchase goods.
	Anyone who has old currency in hand can go to the People's Bank of China's business departments or exchange agencies to exchange for the new currency. Before going to exchange, first count the money in hand, and it is best to separate and bundle the old currency of different denominations. Put the fifty thousand yuan notes together and the ten thousand yuan notes together. When exchanging, it will be convenient to count and save the exchanger's time.
	When exchanging, also pay attention: if there are small denominations of old currency below fifty yuan, they should be rounded up to a hundred yuan before exchanging. Because the smallest denomination of the new currency is one fen, which is equal to one hundred yuan of the old currency.

	V. Banks Will Stop Business to the Public for Three Days
	After the issuance of the new currency, all bank accounts, statements, and vouchers must be calculated in the new currency, that is, from March 1st, all new accounts must be used. Therefore, it is necessary to clear all the old accounts from the past. This requires a one-time conversion and carry-over of all accounting books according to the new and old currency ratio in the accounting work, a careful clearing and verification of creditor and debtor relationships, and a comprehensive review and supervision of various conversion work in the mixed circulation of old and new currencies. Specifically, during the reorganization period, the bank must conduct an interest-bearing transfer of all deposits and loans, calculate the difference between the new and old currencies, fill out reconciliation statements for customers and reissue checks, and clear all old currency inventories. This work is very heavy. Taking Shanghai as an example, just the calculation of interest-bearing transfers of deposits and loans involves about 350,000 public and private deposit accounts and current savings accounts. If each person can complete the interest calculation for more than 200 accounts per day, it will require 1,500 people. In order to prepare in advance and avoid the occurrence of accounting chaos, it is necessary to stop business to the public for three days. February 27th is Sunday, and banks are always closed on holidays, so in fact, banks only stop business to the public for two days. Of course, the bank's closure may be inconvenient for some units and people, but the three-day bank closure time is announced in advance, and all agencies, organizations, enterprises, troops, and individuals can arrange their own currency income in advance.

	VI. Cherish the Renminbi
	The Renminbi is the currency issued by the state and is also something that everyone uses every day, so everyone should cherish the Renminbi.

	I. When receiving banknotes, it is best to wrap the banknotes flat with cloth or paper, do not fold the banknotes, do not crumple or tear them, do not write or scribble on the banknotes, and do not get the banknotes dirty. This can keep the banknotes clean and beautiful, extend the circulation time of the banknotes, and prevent loss.

	II. Shops and vendors should prepare wooden boxes or cardboard boxes for storing banknotes, and separate the banknotes into different denominations and place them flat in the boxes or boxes. Do not handle banknotes with wet or oily hands to keep the banknotes clean and undamaged.

	III. Comrades in public utilities such as tram and bus ticket sellers should place the collected banknotes in the bag in order of size, and do not stuff them in the bag casually. This will not only protect the Renminbi, but also improve work efficiency and reduce errors in work.

	IV. Accounting comrades in various agencies, organizations, enterprises, cooperatives, and troops should flatten and sort the banknotes they handle according to denomination. For example, put one-yuan notes and one-yuan notes together, five-fen notes and five-fen notes together, tie a bundle of 100 notes, and bundle a bundle of 1,000 notes. This can not only protect the Renminbi, but also reduce errors and make the closing work finish early.

	V. When receiving damaged banknotes, everyone should pay attention to repairing them immediately before using them again. If the banknotes are incomplete and inconvenient to use, they should be exchanged at the bank.
	Everyone is responsible for cherishing the Renminbi. If everyone cherishes the Renminbi, it will be of great benefit to the country and individuals.

    新人民币发行中应注意的几个问题
    中国人民银行总行发行局
    为了使广大群众了解有关发行新币的具体问题，现在把以下几个主要问题加以简单的说明。
      一、新币和旧币的兑换比率
    国务院决定从一九五五年三月一日起发行一种新的人民币（简称新币），逐步收回现在流通的人民币（简称旧币）。新币共有十一种，其中主币五种，分一元、二元、三元、五元和十元，辅币六种，分一角、二角、五角、一分、二分、五分。
    国务院规定，新币一元等于旧币一万元，按照这个比率推算，新币一角等于旧币一千元，新币一分等于旧币一百元，其它以此类推。
      二、新币中为什么有二元和三元券
    新币中有二元和三元券的好处就是便利收付，节省币券。例如支付三元的时候，如果没有三元券，就需以一张一元券和一张两元券，或以三张一元券才凑足三元的数目。又如支付八元的时候，如果没有三元券，需以一张五元券、一张二元券、一张一元券才凑足八元；有了三元券，只要一张五元券、一张三元券就行了。这样一次收付可以节省一张票券。以此类推，凡逢“三”逢“八”的款项收付，都可以至少节省一张票券。
      三、储蓄存单、公债券等折算手续
    从三月一日起一切交易计算和货币收支都要以新币为单位，一切契约、合同、单据、凭证、账簿记载等都要按新币计算。所有在新币发行前的一切债权债务关系也从三月一日起按法定比率折成新币计算和清偿，一切在一九五五年三月一日以前所订立的契约、凭证等，不论是否经过证件上的折算手续，从三月一日起都依法定比率折成新币。全国各机关、团体等单位及各公私企业凡与银行有业务往来的，不论存款或放款，都由银行折算后发出对账单，各单位查对签证后在一定时间内退回银行。
    凡持有曾向银行贷款而尚未到期或清偿的借据，在银行的定期、活期储蓄存单、存折，国家一九五○年发行的人民胜利折实公债券，一九五四年发行的经济建设公债券的人，都不必到银行办理折算手续。借据可于贷款到期归还时，公债券可于还本付息时，存单、存折可于到期或要提取时，再按新旧币的法定比率折算。
      四、兑换时应注意事项
    新币发行后，国家将按照法定的比率把旧币全部收回来，国家收回旧币的办法有两个，一个是通过各国营企业、合作社、银行的业务把旧币收回来，不再付出，这是主要的办法，另一个是由人民银行兑换。因此大家拿旧币去买东西，去储蓄，去缴税，也可以到银行去换成新币使用。
    国家规定旧币一万元和五万元的大票只流通到
  一九五五年三月三十一日为止，但在四月三十日以前仍可向人民银行兑换。因此大家要先把一万元和五万元的旧币在规定时间内换成新币。至于五千元及五千元以下的小票流通的时间还要长一些，将来根据兑换情况在不影响人民经济生活正常进行的原则下，再分别规定停止兑换的日期。总之，政府一定负责按照规定比率把旧币全部收回来，所以手里有旧币的人，不要着慌，不要挤兑，不要抢购。
    凡是手里有旧币的人，都可以到人民银行的营业部门或代兑机构去兑换新币。在去兑换之前，先要把手里的钱点清，最好把各种不同券别的旧币分开扎好，五万元的票和五万元的票放在一起，一万元的票与一万元的票放在一起，兑换时，清点方便，可以节省兑换人的时间。
    在兑换时，还要注意：如果有旧币五十元以下的小票，要凑够一百元整数再去兑换。因为新币最小的票券是一分，等于旧币一百元。
      五、银行要停止对外营业三天
    在发行新币以后，银行所有账、表、凭证都要以新币计算，即从三月一日起，要全部改用新账。因此，必须把过去所有的旧账，全部结算清楚。这就需要在会计核算工作方面按照新旧币比率对全部会计账务进行一次折算和结转，对债权债务做一次认真的清理和核对，同时还要对旧币兑换、新旧币混合流通中各种折算工作进行全面的复核监督。具体地说，在整理期间，银行要对全部存、放款进行一次计息转账，计算新旧币折差，向客户填核对账单和换发支票，清理全部旧币库存等。这些工作是很繁重的。单就计算存、放款利息转账工作来说，拿上海一地做例子，有公私存款帐户和活期储蓄约三十五万户，按每人每天最快可完成二百多户利息计算，这样就需要一千五百个人力。为了事前做好准备，避免临时发生账务混乱的现象，所以停止对外营业三天是很必要的。二月二十七日是星期天，银行向来都是例假休息，所以实际上银行停止对外营业只是两天。当然，银行停业期间，可能有些单位及人民感到不方便，但是，银行停业三天的时间是提前告诉大家的，各机关、团体、企业、部队和个人可以事先安排本身的货币收入。
      六、爱护人民币
    人民币是国家发行的货币，也是每个人天天都要使用的东西，所以大家都应该爱护人民币。
    一、大家收到钞票时，最好用布或纸把钞票平铺包起来，不要把钞票折叠，不要乱揉乱扯，不要在钞票上乱写乱涂，不要把钞票弄脏。这样就可以保持钞票的干净美观，延长钞票的流通使用时间，并且不致丢失。
    二、商店摊贩应置备放钞票的木箱或硬纸盒，把钞票分别大小面额分开平放在箱内或盒内，不要用湿手或油手拿钞票，保持钞票的干净和不致受损。
    三、公用事业如电车、公共汽车的售票员等同志，应将收进的钞票按大小顺序平放在袋里，不要随便塞在袋里，这样不但可以保护人民币，并且还可以提高工作效率减少工作中的错误。
    四、各机关、团体、企业、合作社、部队的出纳同志应将经手的钞票按券别平铺整理，如一元票和一元票放在一起，五分票和五分票放在一起，够一百张扎一把，够一千张捆一捆，这样既可保护人民币，又可减少错误，使结账工作提前结束。
    五、收到残破币时，大家要注意即时粘补好以后再使用。如果票子残缺不便使时，要到银行兑换。
    爱护人民币人人有责，大家都来爱护人民币，这样，对国家对个人都是有很大好处的。
