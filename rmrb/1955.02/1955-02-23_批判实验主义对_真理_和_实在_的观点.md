Criticizing Experimentalism's Views on "Truth" and "Reality"
Sun Dingguo

The question of "truth theory" raised by experimentalists directly touches upon all aspects of the major philosophical question of truth, such as whether there is objective truth, the relationship between relative and absolute truth, the criteria for testing truth, and so on. Experimentalism has launched a vicious attack on all important aspects of the Marxist theory of truth. Therefore, we must conduct a serious and conscientious criticism of it.

Experimentalists are masters of self-contradiction. When they talk about "empiricism," they try to evade the fundamental philosophical questions "by leaving them unresolved." But when they talk about "realism" (actually, "realism" and "empiricism" are the same thing), they are forced to raise the question clearly, which gives us a crucial starting point for criticizing their "truth theory." Let us begin here!

I. The Fundamental Opposition Between Marxist Materialism, Theory of Sensation, and Experimentalism's "Realism" and "Theory of Sensation"

Hu Shi has a wonderful passage about James' "realism":

"What we call 'Reality' contains three main parts: (A) sensation, (B) various relationships between sensation and sensation, and between image and image, (C) old truths. … Let's talk about sensation first. The arrival of sensation is like a surge of great water, it is not up to us to decide. But we each have special interests, and different interests lead to different sensations. Because the parts we pay attention to are different, the reality in each person's mind is also different. When a poet and a botanist go out for a walk together, the poet only sees the bright sun and gentle breeze, the bright flowers and beautiful birds; the botanist only sees what grass grows by the roadside, what flowers bloom on the fence, and what trees are planted by the river. The universes of these two people are very different.

"Let's talk about the relationship between sensation and the relationship between images. The same starry sky has different relationships in the eyes of poets and astronomers. The same two things, you only see the temporal order, but I see the causal relationship. The same speech, you feel that the person's tone is appropriate, but I feel that the person's reasoning is complete. One hundred coins can be arranged into two sets of fifty, or four sets of twenty-five, or ten sets of ten.

"The old truths need not be said (please note that we will not mention what Hu Shi thinks needs no saying below — Sun). In short, reality is reality that we have transformed ourselves. … The universe is the universe we have created through our own efforts." (Emphasis added by me — Sun) [1]

This is truly a poetic passage, a wonderful realm with everything one could wish for. But precisely here, the subjective idealism of experimentalism's "realism" is completely exposed, as is the essence of its antagonism with Marxist materialism.

To make it easier for readers to understand, let us first summarize the main points of this quote as follows:

First, regarding sensation. First, Hu Shi believes that sensation varies with people's interests, so the source of sensation is interest, and interest is equal to sensation; second, Hu Shi also believes that people pay attention to different parts, and the "reality" in each person's mind is different. Poets and botanists pay attention to different parts, have different sensations, so their universes are very different. Therefore, "reality" is sensation, and the universe is sensation. This is conclusion one.

Second, regarding the relationship between sensation and the relationship between images. First, the different feelings and images relations caused by the different sensations of the starry sky in the eyes of poets and astronomers gives them their different universes, and different "realities"; second, the differences in the relationship between sensations and images caused by two people's different feelings about an event or speech gives them different universes, and different "realities"; third, the different ways a person arranges one hundred coins still represents differences in the relationship between sensation and image, and thus different universes, and different "realities". This is conclusion two.

Based on the above two conclusions, Hu Shi draws a third conclusion: "Reality" is "reality" that we have transformed ourselves, and the universe is the universe we have created through our own efforts.

From this, it can be clearly seen that sensation is primary, while "reality" and the universe are secondary. Furthermore, "reality" and the universe are derivatives of sensation, and at the same time exist within sensation. Therefore, sensation is the experimentalist's purely subjective world, and "reality" and the universe are still the experimentalist's purely subjective world. This is the entire essence of the "realism" advocated by James and Hu Shi. Obviously, this kind of "realism" is experimentalists' blatant attack on the materialism of Marxist philosophy. From the philosophical viewpoint of Marxism, matter is primary, while sensation is secondary. Without the existence of objective matter, it is impossible to produce any sensation in people. Here, Hu Shi's own example is enough to refute Hu Shi's nonsense.

The bright sun and gentle breeze, bright flowers and beautiful birds, flowers, grasses, trees, and starry sky in the eyes of poets, botanists, and astronomers—all these natural phenomena are objectively existing realities, the objective material world. It is precisely because there is first this objective material world that the feelings and interests of poets are aroused, and the feelings and interests of botanists and astronomers are aroused. Obviously, here, these objectively existing natural phenomena, whether they are objects for poets to write scenery and express emotions, or objects for natural scientists to conduct scientific research, always exist objectively, and always exist objectively without being transferred by people's will (sensation, interest). This is the viewpoint of Marxist materialism, and this is the starting point of the materialist theory of sensation in Marxism.

Starting from the viewpoint of experimentalism's "realism," the conclusion is drawn that sensation is primary, and "reality" and the universe are secondary. Therefore, the real content of sensation is only his subjective world, and not a reflection of the objective world. Starting from the materialism of dialectical materialism, the conclusion is drawn that matter is primary, and sensation is secondary. Therefore, the real content of sensation is not the subjective world, but a reflection of the objective world.

The materialism and theory of sensation of dialectical materialism and the "realism" and "theory of sensation" of experimentalism are thus sharply opposed.

However, here we must also point out that James' old tune, as retold by Hu Shi, is nothing new, but precisely a rehash of Berkeley's "to be is to be perceived" and Mach's "objects are complexes of sensations." Here we can quote a passage written by Mach in 1872 as proof. This passage is: The task of science, "can only be: (1) to study the laws of connection between representations (psychology). — (2) to discover the laws of connection between sensations (physics). — (3) to explain the laws of connection between sensations and representations (psychophysics)" [2].

Please compare the above three points of Mach with the three points of James as retold by Hu Shi. Except for the old "truth" point, they are almost completely copied.

It is precisely here that it cannot but attract the reader's attention that using the word "sensation" to confuse the fundamental line between materialism and idealism in philosophy, just like using the word "experience" to confuse the two fundamental lines between materialism and idealism, is a common trick of all Machists.

Precisely because of this, we must always remember one of the important principles put forward by Lenin regarding the theory of sensation, that is, starting from the proposition of acknowledging sensation, one can embark on two completely different routes, either the route of subjective idealism or the route of materialism. Lenin pointed out: "Starting from sensation, one can advance along the line of subjectivism to solipsism ('body is a complex or combination of sensations'), or advance along the line of objectivism to materialism ('sensation is an image of a body, of the external world'). In the first point of view — agnosticism, or slightly further, subjective idealism — objective truth is impossible. In the second point of view, that is, materialism, it is important to acknowledge objective truth." [3]

Obviously, it is of great significance to further analyze the objective truth theory of dialectical materialism and the subjective "truth theory" of experimentalism on this basis.

II. The Fundamental Opposition Between Objective Truth Theory and Subjective "Truth Theory"

Regarding experimentalism's subjective "truth theory," Hu Shi retold this passage from James: "What is 'Truth'? This question is a very important question in the history of Western philosophy. Those old-school philosophers say that truth is an image that conforms to 'reality'. The image that conforms to 'reality' is true; the image that does not conform to 'reality' is false. This is very broad, and we must ask, what does it mean to 'conform to reality'? Old-school philosophers say that 'a true image is a copy of reality.' James asked, 'For example, the clock on the wall, we can imagine the appearance of the clock with our eyes closed, and that can be said to be a copy. But is the concept of the use of the clock that arises in my mind also a copy? What is it copying? Also, if we say that the spring of the clock is elastic, what is this concept copying? It can be seen that for all images that cannot have a copy, how can the phrase "conform to reality" be explained?'" [4]

This is clearly a vicious attack on the epistemology of scientific materialism—the theory of reflection! Yes, based on the theory that matter is primary and consciousness is secondary, philosophers of scientific materialism believe that truth exists objectively. Everything that exists objectively has its own inherent essence and attributes, and its own inherent objective regularity. This objective regularity is objective truth. Therefore, from the perspective of epistemology, whether people's understanding is correct refers to whether it conforms to the regularity of this objective thing. This is the only standard for correctness and error. Now, taking the example cited by James, for example, the clock on the wall is reflected in people's minds, you must admit that this clock is an objective existence, and the fact that we have a reflection of the clock in our minds is due to the existence of the clock. Here, even if James closes his eyes (or is blind), everything James imagines in his mind about the clock cannot but be a copy of the clock. However, James here actually raises a difficult problem for materialists. He proposes that even if the appearance of the clock can be a copy, the concept of the use of the clock that arises in his mind is not a copy, and the concept of the elasticity of the spring of the clock is also not a copy. This means that the use of the clock and the elasticity of the spring of the clock are not inherent in the clock itself. This is complete nonsense that deviates from common sense. May I ask, what else besides the inherent use of the clock has aroused the concept of the use of the clock in James's mind? What else besides the elasticity of the clock's spring has aroused the concept of the elasticity of the spring in James's mind? From the point of view of materialism, it is precisely the use of the clock that has aroused the concept of the use of the clock, and it is precisely the elasticity of the clock's spring that has aroused the concept of the elasticity of the spring. This precisely proves that people's sensations, thoughts, and concepts are copies of the inherent attributes of the objective clock. Without the objective existence of the clock, without the inherent attributes of the clock, no God (or any devil) could give James, the son of this religious person, any concept about the clock! And James precisely denies this, thus nakedly exposing the true face of his subjective "truth theory"!

But please also note: we must never lightly let go of James's subjective "truth theory" just because it is a kind of world view nonsense and a theory of truth nonsense. This nonsense involves an extremely serious issue, involving the fundamental issue of epistemology in philosophy.

Marxist epistemology first proposes the only correct epistemological theory that the objective world is knowable on the basis of acknowledging that matter is primary and consciousness is secondary.

Regarding this only scientific epistemological principle, Lenin drew the following important conclusion based on Engels' analysis of the example of extracting alizarin from coal tar: "(1) Things exist independently of our consciousness, independently of our sensations, outside of us, because undoubtedly, alizarin existed in coal tar yesterday, and just as undoubtedly, we knew nothing about this existence yesterday, we did not get any sensation from this alizarin.

(2) There is absolutely no and cannot be any principled difference between phenomena and things-in-themselves. The difference is simply the difference between what is already known and what is not yet known. ...

(3) In epistemology, as in all other fields of science, we should think dialectically, that is, not think that our knowledge is complete and unchanging, but analyze how knowledge emerged from ignorance, and how incomplete and inaccurate knowledge became more complete and more accurate knowledge." (Emphasis added by me — Sun) [5]

Obviously, this is the only correct scientific epistemology, and this epistemology itself powerfully opens up extremely broad roads for scientific and revolutionary undertakings. Because, since things exist independently of our consciousness and sensations outside of us, then our understanding must strive to conform to things or the objective world that exists outside of us. This puts forward the fundamental requirement of the unity of the subjective and the objective in epistemology. Since there is no and cannot be any principled difference between phenomena and things-in-themselves, then this strengthens people's conviction in scientific knowledge that has been proven through practice. Since one must think dialectically in epistemology, this cannot but encourage people to forge ahead bravely in pursuit of objective truth, so that people's scientific knowledge becomes increasingly rich and increasingly profound.

The working class of the whole world and its vanguard—the Communist Party and the Workers' Party—are precisely correctly applying this scientific epistemology, taking objective truth, that is, the regularity of objective things, as the objective material basis of our program, line, principles, and policies, thereby carrying out the great work of transforming the world.

In contrast, the epistemology of experimentalism, is on the premise of not admitting that matter is primary, and consciousness is secondary and denies the existence of objective truth. Therefore, their so-called "truth" is purely subjective. In this way, they cannot but fall into the quagmire of agnosticism in epistemology. Starting from this agnosticism, James leads people to theism: "I myself stubbornly disbelieve that our human experience is the highest experience in the universe. I would rather believe that the relationship between us humans and the entire universe is like the relationship between our cats and dogs and human life. Cats and dogs often play in our living rooms and study rooms, and they also participate in our lives, but they don't understand the meaning of our lives at all. Our human life is like a circle, and they live on the tangent line of this circle, and they don't know where this circle begins or ends. We are also like this. We also live on the tangent line of this circle of the entire universe. But the daily life of cats and dogs can prove that they have many ideals in common with us, so according to the evidence of religious experience, we can also believe that higher divine powers than humans are real, and these divine powers are also striving to save this world in the direction of human ideals." [6]

This is a disgusting passage. However, this is a wonderful and vivid description of the epistemology of modern agnostics that the world is unknowable. What is particularly important here is James's firm denial of objective truth. He desperately attempts to regard higher divine powers than humans as "real" things, and hopes to rely on this divine power to save the capitalist world in the direction of "human ideals" (that is, the direction of the ideals of the dying bourgeoisie). This is as Lenin said, the agnostic's denial of objective truth cannot but open the door to all ghosts, demons, and Catholic saints (the fact that US imperialism takes the Vatican as one of its reactionary pillars is iron proof). Based on this epistemology, experimentalists cannot but firmly oppose objective truth and deny the regularity of the objective world. Because this regularity tells us that the objective world is developing and changing, the inevitable elimination of the capitalist system and the inevitable replacement of the capitalist system by the socialist system, and the inevitable collapse and demise of US imperialism have already been historically destined, this is objective truth. James, the philosopher who serves imperialism, how can he not fear such an objective truth? How can he not tremble in the face of the regularity of the objective world? If he doesn't run to the quagmire of agnosticism and shout, what powerful voice will he utter? The tangent line of the universe circle that James speaks of is none other than the edge of the death of US imperialism.

Only when we expose this point can we deeply understand why Hu Shi said that "scientific laws are man-made, hypothetical—whether it is applicable depends entirely on whether it can satisfactorily explain the facts." As a slave of imperialism, Hu Shi, the so-called truth is the "truth" that serves US imperialism or the ruling class of old China. For the benefit of imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, he cannot but oppose any objective truth.

The issue is very clear: admitting the knowability of the world means admitting objective truth. This is the starting point of Marxist epistemology, which in itself brings the partisanship of our Marxist philosophical epistemology. Admitting the unknowability of the world and admitting subjective "truth" is the starting point of the epistemology of experimentalism, which in itself also brings the partisanship of the epistemology of experimentalism.

III. Experimentalism's Denial of Absolute Truth and Our Analysis of the Correct Relationship Between Absolute Truth and Relative Truth

When criticizing the Russian Machist Bogdanov, Lenin sharply pointed out that Bogdanov confused the question of whether there is objective truth with the question of the relationship between absolute truth and relative truth. Now, the experimentalist Hu Shi is similarly repeating the mistake of the Machist Bogdanov. He attempts to play the trick of denying permanent truth to deny the existence of absolute truth.

Hu Shi's words are as follows: "Knowing that there is no permanently unchanging truth in the world, and no absolute truth, can one arouse a sense of intellectual responsibility ... That absolute truth is suspended in the air, abstract, general, without evidence, and cannot be verified." [7]

Hu Shi here equates permanently unchanging truth with absolute truth. This is not out of ignorance, but his conspiracy. Marxism believes that the so-called permanently unchanging truth is that the historically reactionary ruling class eternalizes and absolutizes things that are beneficial to their rule. Absolute truth refers to the absoluteness of truth, which is a problem closely related to the relativity of truth. As Lenin said: "If there is objective truth, can the representation of a person expressing objective truth express it all at once, completely, unconditionally, and absolutely, or can it only express it approximately and relatively? This ... is the question of the relationship between absolute truth and relative truth." [8]

The reason why Hu Shi wants to play the trick of denying permanent truth (in fact, Hu Shi has his own permanent truth) to deny absolute truth is precisely the inevitable logical result of his denial of objective truth; and the reason why we Marxists admit absolute truth is precisely the inevitable logical result of our admission of objective truth. Lenin said:

"To be a materialist is to recognize the objective truth revealed by our sensory organs. To recognize objective truth, that is, truth that does not depend on man and mankind, is to recognize absolute truth in this or that way." [9]

Hu Shi believes that only by knowing that there is no absolute truth in the world can one arouse a sense of intellectual responsibility. In fact, if one does not admit that there is absolute truth, then one must abolish science and eliminate any possible intellectual responsibility of mankind. What Hu Shi calls absolute truth being suspended in the air, abstract, general, without evidence, and unable to be verified is just one of his ways of denying objective truth.

Marxism's complete statement about truth is: Truth is objective, absolute, and relative. This is the materialism and dialectics of Marxism regarding truth.

Marxism insists on the theory of objective truth and must insist on the theory of absolute truth. It believes that natural phenomena and social phenomena all have their absolute truth, and absolute truth exists objectively. At the same time, it believes that absolute truth cannot be reached by people all at once. Therefore, on the basis of admitting absolute truth, Marxism also points out that people gradually approach absolute truth through relative truth.

At a certain stage in the historical development process of human understanding, the understanding of certain things can only have the meaning of relative truth, but it contains particles of absolute truth. For example, regarding the question of the structure of matter, ancient people once thought that it was composed of elements such as air, water, fire, and earth. Of course, this is a very simple guess, however, this guess already contains particles of certain absolute truth. In the 17th and 18th centuries, due to the development of science, physicists believed that matter was composed of atoms, and atoms were the indivisible smallest particles of matter. Compared with considering air, water, fire, and earth as the elements that make up matter, this understanding contains more particles of absolute truth. However, at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries, due to the discovery of radioactive elements, it became possible to split atoms, so people's understanding penetrated into the interior of atoms and discovered the complex structure of the interior of atoms. In this way, people realized that atoms are not the indivisible smallest particles of matter, and the interior of atoms also contains small particles with different properties such as protons, neutrons, electrons, positrons, mesons, and neutrinos. Obviously, this great discovery has greatly advanced people's understanding of the structure of matter towards absolute truth. However, it is not the final absolute truth, and like the previous understanding of the structure of matter, it still only has the meaning of relative truth. This is true for natural phenomena, and it is also true for social phenomena.

It can be seen from this that the correct solution to the relationship between absolute truth and relative truth is the question of the breadth and depth of people's understanding of objective truth. People's understanding cannot comprehensively and absolutely reflect the complex situation of the objective world all at once, but it can constantly, gradually, and relatively approach and reflect it. The relativity of truth lies in the fact that it reflects the objective truth that people can understand under certain historical conditions. Therefore, any relative truth contains particles of absolute truth. This is called absolute within relative.

Admitting objective truth and also admitting the theory of absolute truth and gradually approaching absolute truth through relative truth has great significance in revolutionary practice. Under the guidance of this theory, people can hold infinite enthusiasm for the great future, and people can contribute their greatest strength to the endless objective truth to discover it and pursue it; under the guidance of this theory, people can always maintain a humble and cautious attitude, and continuously approach absolute truth on the basis of the discovered relative truth; of course, under the guidance of this theory, people can also firmly grasp the current reality for the great future, believe in the certainty of scientific knowledge, believe in the reality of the current policies and guidelines of the party and the state, and work hard and tenaciously for tomorrow and also seize today with all our strength.

However, experimentalists actually attempt to deny absolute truth. Of course, it is impossible to understand the relationship between relative truth and absolute truth, and it is even more impossible to admit the theory of gradually approaching absolute truth through relative truth. Here, we should also point out that the epistemology of experimentalism is the same as the epistemology of Machism, they both take relativism as the basis of epistemology.

What is relativism? In short, it is to absolutize the factor of the relativity of people's understanding. Relativism itself cannot but be metaphysical. From the Marxist point of view, the opposition between absolute and relative is also relative, that is to say, neither can the absolute side be absolutized, nor can the relative side be absolutized, but they must be grasped dialectically. Since experimentalists absolutize the relativity of people's understanding, then it is impossible not to fall into absolute skepticism, agnosticism, and sophistry or subjectivism. Lenin said: "From the point of view of naked relativism, any sophistry can be proved to be correct." [10] And here, James' sophistry about "monism and pluralism" provides us with iron evidence. He said: "The old problem lies in seeing plural psychology as very scary, thinking that pluralism is chaos, and it must be systematic and consistent; in fact, from another point of view, seeing human experience as a continuous stream of consciousness, both monism and pluralism have a place. … So the monism and pluralism of the world are not a problem, but the problem lies in where to apply unity and where to apply pluralism." [11] What a pluralism, what a relativism, use pluralism where pluralism should be used, use monism where monism should be used, is there any absolute truth to speak of?

Obviously, any denial of absolute truth cannot but be a relativistic point of view, and since relativism is sophistry in theory, it cannot but serve reactionary forces politically.

It is precisely in this sense that Lenin's famous passage cannot but become a principle that Marxism adheres to unswervingly. This passage is: "Dialectics, ... contains the possibilities of relativism, negation, and skepticism, but does not result in relativism. Marx and Engels' materialist dialectics unconditionally contains relativism, but does not result in relativism, that is to say, it does not recognize the relativity of all our knowledge in the sense of denying objective truth, but in the sense of the historical conditionality of the limits of our knowledge of this truth." [12] (Emphasis is all original)

IV. Two Views of Practice and Two Views of Effect

We now also need to study the question of the standard for testing truth. Regarding this, experimentalists raise extremely sharp questions to Marxism, that is, their "theory of effect." When retellling the philosophy of James and Dewey, Hu Shi repeatedly emphasized that the method of experimentalism focuses on practical effects. What is the "effect" they are talking about? That is to explain things with man-made hypotheses and see if the explanation is satisfactory. He said: "Experimentalism never admits that what we call 'truth' is a permanently unchanging principle of nature; it only admits that all 'truths' are applied hypotheses; whether a hypothesis is true depends entirely on whether it can produce the effect it should produce. This is the 'attitude of the scientific laboratory.'" [13] "... The laws are just man-made hypotheses used to explain the phenomena of things. If the explanation is satisfactory, it is true. If the explanation is not satisfactory, it is not true." (Emphasis added by me — Sun) [14]

According to Hu Shi's statement, if the explanation is "satisfactory," there is an effect. Then, what exactly is the standard of satisfaction? Is it "satisfaction" that distorts the objective to obey the subjective, or is it satisfaction in which the subjective and objective are consistent? Therefore, what to use as the standard of satisfaction is the core of this issue. Obviously, the so-called "satisfaction" of experimentalists can only be his subjective satisfaction, and can only be "satisfaction" that distorts the objective to obey his subjective, because they fundamentally do not admit objective truth.

We have quoted James as saying that one can use monism when monism is useful, and one can use pluralism when pluralism is useful. Of course, this can always be explained "satisfactorily" at any time. Slave owners can explain the exploitation of slaves "satisfactorily"; feudal lords can explain the oppression of serfs "satisfactorily"; capitalists can explain the exploitation of workers "satisfactorily"; Wall Street bosses can of course explain why they want to wage war "satisfactorily." Taking Hu Shi as an example, describing Chen Jiongming as revolutionary and Sun Yat-sen as unrevolutionary can be explained "satisfactorily"; using the money of Yan Xishan and He Jian to speak for the feudal warlords can be explained "satisfactorily"; returning to Taiwan from the United States to cast a vote for Chiang Kai-shek and transporting the only remaining antiques from Taiwan to the United States can be explained "satisfactorily"; writing articles and giving speeches against the Communist Party and against the People's Republic of China to receive dollar subsidies from US imperialism to eke out a living in his dying years can of course also be explained "satisfactorily"! This is as Lenin said: "For materialists, the 'effect' of human practice proves the conformity of our representations with the objective nature of the things we perceive. For solipsists, the 'effect' is everything I need in practice, and practice can be separated from epistemology." (Emphasis added by me — Sun) [15] Marxism believes that only practice is the standard for testing truth, and only practice is the basis of epistemology. Comrade Mao Zedong repeatedly discussed in his "On Practice" that only practice is the standard for testing knowledge. Knowledge can only come from practice and be tested by practice. This is the source of the powerful strength of Marxist epistemology.

Therefore, readers must note that the "effect" mentioned by experimentalists cannot be confused with the effect we usually talk about. Their "effect" is the "effect" that distorts the objective to conform to the subjective, and their "effect" is the manifestation of the interests of imperialism. And our effect is the effect in which the subjective and objective are consistent, and is the manifestation of the interests of the working class and working people of the whole world.

Two kinds of practice, two kinds of effect, this is what we should clearly distinguish from experimentalists!

V. The Struggle Between Science and Anti-Science

After we have criticized all aspects of experimentalism's "truth theory," we cannot but finally raise the question of the struggle between science and anti-science. Only the dialectical materialist world view, methodology, and epistemology can be the only scientific world view, methodology, and epistemology. The reason is very simple, this is first because it admits objective truth. Only on the basis of admitting objective truth can true science be produced. For experimentalists, they fundamentally do not admit objective truth, then there is no science to speak of. Experimentalists, like all idealists, steal and distort the achievements of natural science to draw conclusions that are beneficial to them. Machism is like this, and experimentalism is also like this. Hu Shi distorts scientific achievements, believing that because of the emergence of Darwinism, the old scientific laws have been abolished, and new scientific laws have been created. Therefore, he draws the conclusion that scientific laws are man-made. This is the best proof. Hu Shi’s discussion of the battle about "Science" and life view between the metaphysical ghosts, Ding Wenjiang and Zhang Junmai is the best proof that he actually labels the metaphysical ghost Ding Wenjiang with the tag of science.

Experimentalism's opposition to science itself must inevitably lead to the road of fideism. And Hu Shi's article "My Religion" ("Immortality") precisely illustrates that he is leading to fideism. There is fundamentally no science to speak of in Hu Shi. Although he pretends in this regard that James is the son of a religious person, in reality, Hu Shi is precisely a descendant of the son of this religious person.

Therefore, when liquidating the poisonous influence of Hu Shi's thought, struggling to defend science cannot but be our sacred task.

    批判实验主义对“真理”和“实在”的观点
    孙定国
    实验主义者所提出来的“真理论”的问题是直接接触到了关于真理——这个哲学上的重大问题之一——的一切方面，例如关于有没有客观真理的问题，关于相对真理和绝对真理的关系的问题，关于检验真理的标准的问题，等等。实验主义对于马克思主义真理论的各个重要方面都展开了穷凶极恶的进攻。为此，我们就必须对它进行严肃认真的批判。
    实验主义者是最擅长于自己打自己嘴巴的，当他们谈到“经验论”的时候，对于哲学上的根本问题企图“以不了了之”来逃避它，而当谈到“实在论”（实际上“实在论”和“经验论”是一个东西）的时候，却又被迫把这个问题明白地提出来了，这就给予了我们批判它的“真理论”的一个极为重要的起点。现在就让我们从这里开始吧！
    一、马克思主义的物质论、感觉论和实验主义的“实在论”“感
        觉论”的根本对立
    胡适对于詹姆士的“实在论”的转述有这样一段妙文：
    “我们所谓‘实在’（Reality）含有三大部分：（A）感觉，（B）感觉与感觉之间及意象与意象之间的种种关系，（C）旧有的真理。……我们且先说感觉。感觉之来，就同大水汹涌，是不由我们自主的。但是我们各有特别的兴趣，兴趣不同，所留意的感觉也不同。因为我们所注意的部分不同，所以各人心目中的实在也就不同。一个诗人和一个植物学者同走出门游玩，那诗人眼里只见得日朗风轻，花明鸟媚；那植物学者只见得道旁长的是什么草，篱上开的是什么花，河边栽的是什么树。这两个人的宇宙是大不相同的。
    “再说感觉的关系和意象的关系。一样的满天星斗，在诗人的眼里和在天文学者的眼里，便有种种不同的关系。一样的两件事，你只见得时间的先后，我却见得因果的关系。一样的一篇演说，你觉得这人声调高低得宜，我觉得这人论理完密。一百个大钱，你可以摆成两座五十的，也可以摆成四座二十五的，也可以摆成十座十个的。
      “那旧有的真理更不用说了（请读者注意，胡适认为不用说的东西，我们在下边也不提到它了——孙）。总而言之，实在是我们自己改造过的实在。……宇宙是经过我们自己创造的工夫的。”（着重点是我加的——孙）〔一〕
    这真是一段富有诗意的文章，真是应有尽有的绝妙境界。可是恰恰在这里，就已经完全暴露了实验主义的“实在论”的主观唯心论的实质，暴露了它和马克思主义物质论的对抗的实质。
    为了使读者容易明白起见，我们先把这一段引文的主要论点归结如下：
    首先是关于感觉。第一、胡适认为感觉是随着人的兴趣不同而有所不同，因此，感觉的来源是兴趣，而兴趣也就等于是感觉了；第二，胡适又认为人们注意的部分不同，各人心目中的“实在”也就不同，诗人和植物学者所注意的部分不同，感觉不同，从而他们的宇宙也就大不相同。因此，“实在”也就是感觉，宇宙也就是感觉了。这是结论之一。
    其次是关于感觉的关系和意象的关系。第一、诗人和天文学者眼里的满天星斗的不同的感觉所引起的种种不同的感觉和意象的关系，就有了他们的不同的宇宙，不同的“实在”；第二、两个人对于一件事、一篇演说有不同的感觉所引起的感觉和意象的关系的不同，就有了不同的宇宙、不同的“实在”；第三、一个人对于一百个大钱的摆法不同，也还是代表了感觉和意象的关系的不同，因而又有了不同的宇宙、不同的“实在”。这是结论之二。
    胡适在上面的两个结论的基础上就得出第三个结论：“实在”是我们自己改造过的“实在”，宇宙是经过我们自己创造的宇宙。
    从这里可以明白看出：感觉是第一性的而“实在”、宇宙是第二性的。再进一步说，“实在”、宇宙是感觉的派生物，而同时又存在于感觉之中。因此，感觉是实验主义者纯主观的世界，而“实在”、宇宙也还是实验主义者的纯主观世界。这就是詹姆士和胡适所宣扬的“实在论”的全部精髓。显然，这种“实在论”是实验主义者在明目张胆地攻击马克思主义哲学的物质论。从马克思主义的哲学观点看来，物质是第一性的，而感觉却是第二性的。没有客观物质的存在，就不可能产生人们的任何感觉，在这里，即以胡适自己所举的例子就足够驳斥胡适的胡说了。
    诗人、植物学者和天文学者眼里的日朗风轻、花明鸟媚、花草树木和满天星斗——这一切自然现象正是客观存在着的实在，正是客观的物质世界，正是由于首先有了这个客观的物质世界，才引起了诗人的感觉和兴趣，才引起了植物学者和天文学者的感觉和兴趣。显然，在这里，这些客观存在着的自然现象，不管是诗人借以为写景抒情的对象，还是自然科学者借以为科学研究的对象，总是客观存在着的，总是不以人们的意志（感觉、兴趣）为转移而客观存在着的。这就是马克思主义的物质论的观点，这也就是马克思主义的唯物论的感觉论的出发点。
    从实验主义的“实在论”的观点出发，就得出结论：感觉是第一性的，“实在”、宇宙是第二性的，因而感觉的实在内容，只是他的主观世界，而并不是客观世界的反映。从辩证唯物论的物质论出发，就得出结论：物质是第一性的，感觉是第二性的，因而感觉的实在内容，不是主观世界，而是客观世界的反映。
    辩证唯物论的物质论、感觉论和实验主义的“实在论”“感觉论”就是这样尖锐地对立着。
    但是，在这里我们还必须指出，胡适所转述的詹姆士的旧调子，并不是什么新的东西，而恰恰就是贝克莱的“存在就是被感知”，马赫的“物是感觉的复合”的旧调重弹。在这里我们可以引出马赫在一八七二年所写的一段话作证。这一段话就是：科学底任务，“只能是：（一）研究表象之间的联系底规律（心理学）。——（二）发现感觉之间的联系底规律（物理学）。——（三）阐明感觉和表象之间的联系底规律（心理物理学）”〔二〕。
    请读者对比一下，马赫在这里的三条，和胡适所转述的詹姆士的三条，除开旧有的“真理”一条外，几乎完全是照抄下来。
    正是在这里，不能不引起读者注意，利用“感觉”这个字眼来混淆哲学上的唯物论和唯心论的根本路线，正像利用“经验”的字眼来混淆唯物论和唯心论的两条根本路线一样，是一切马赫主义者的惯技。
    正因为是这样，我们不能不永远记住列宁关于
  感觉论所提出的重要原理之一，即从承认感觉这一命题出发，可以走上完全不同的两条路线，可能走上主观唯心论的路线，也可能走上唯物论的路线。列宁指出：“从感觉出发，可以依着主观主义底路线前进而达到唯我论（“物体是感觉底复合或结合”），或依着客观主义底路线前进而达到唯物论（感觉是物体、外间世界底映象）。在第一种观点——不可知论，或更稍进一步，主观唯心论——看来，客观真理是不能有的。在第二种观点，即唯物论看来，承认客观真理是重要的。”〔三〕
    显然，我们在这基础上，进一步来分析辩证唯物主义客观真理论和实验主义主观“真理论”是有重大意义的。
    二、客观真理论和主观“真理论”的根本对立
    关于实验主义的主观“真理论”，胡适转述了詹姆士这一段话：“什么是‘真理’（Truth）？这个问题在西洋哲学史上是一个顶重要的问题。那些旧派的哲学家说真理就是同‘实在’相符合的意象。这个意象和‘实在’相符合，便是真的；那个意象和‘实在’不相符合，便是假的。这话很宽泛，我们须要问，什么叫做‘和实在相符合’？旧派的哲学家说‘真的意象就是实在的摹本（Copy）。’詹姆士问道，‘譬如墙上的钟，我们闭了眼睛可以想像钟的模样，那还可说是一种摹本。但是我心里起的钟的用处的观念，也是摹本吗？摹的是什么呢？又如我们说钟的发条有弹性，这个观念摹的又是什么呢？这就可见一切不能有摹本的意象，那
  “和实在相符合”一句话又怎么解说呢？’”〔四〕
    这显然是在向着科学唯物论的认识论——反映论作恶毒的攻击！是的，科学唯物论的哲学家在物质是第一性的，意识是第二性的理论基础之上，是认为真理是客观存在着的，凡是客观存在的事物，都有它自己所固有的本质和属性，都有它自己所固有的客观规律性。这个客观规律性，也就是客观真理。因此，从认识论上来说，人们认识的正确与否，也就是指的和这个客观事物的规律性相符合与否。这就是正确与错误的唯一标准。现在即以詹姆士举的例为例，譬如墙上的钟反映到人的头脑中来，你就必须承认这个钟是一个客观存在，而我们头脑中有了钟的反映乃是由于钟的存在。在这里那怕就是詹姆士闭了眼睛（或者说是瞎了眼睛），但是詹姆士头脑中所想像的钟的一切都不能不是这个钟的摹本的。可是，詹姆士在这里却竟然给唯物论者提出难题来。他提出即使钟的模样可以是摹本，但是在他心里所起的钟的用处的观念不是摹本，钟的发条有弹性这个观念也不是摹本。这就是说钟的用处和钟的发条有弹性，这不是钟的本身所固有的。这完全是离开人的常识的胡说。试问，不是钟所固有的用处，又是什么东西引起了詹姆士心里的钟的用处的观念呢？不是钟的发条有弹性，又是什么东西引起詹姆士的心里的发条有弹性这个观念呢？从唯物主义的观点看来，正是由于钟的用处才引起了钟的用处的这个观念，正是由于钟的发条有弹性才引起了钟的发条有弹性这个观念，这恰恰就是证明了人的感觉、思维、观念是对于客观的钟所固有的属性的摹本。没有钟的客观存在，没有钟的固有属性，任何上帝（或者是任何魔鬼）都不可能给予这个宗教家的儿子——詹姆士关于钟的任何观念！而詹姆士恰恰就是否认了这一点，因之，那就赤裸裸地暴露出他的主观“真理论”的真像了！
    但是还要请读者注意：我们决不应该为詹姆士的这种主观“真理论”只是一种世界观上的混蛋和真理论上的胡说而轻轻放过。这种胡说牵涉到一个极为严重的问题，牵涉到哲学上的认识论的根本问题。
    马克思主义的认识论首先是在承认物质第一性和意识第二性的基础之上而提出了客观世界是可知的这样一个唯一正确的认识论的理论。
    关于这个唯一科学的认识论的原理，列宁曾根据恩格斯分析从煤焦油里取出亚里查林的例子而得出来如下的重要结论：“（一）物是不依赖于我们的意识，不依赖于我们的感觉，在我们之外存在着，因为无疑地，亚里查林昨天曾存在于煤焦油中，而同样无疑地，我们昨天还对于这个存在一无所知，我们没有从这个亚里查林方面得到任何感觉。
    （二）在现象与物自体之间决然没有而且也不能有任何原则的差异。区别简单地只是已经认识的与尚未认识的之间的区别。……
    （三）在认识论上，正如在科学底其他一切领域中一样，我们应该辩证地思考，即是，不要以为我们的认识是既成的和不变的，而要分析从无知中怎样出现了知识，不完全的、不确切的知识怎样变成了更完全的和更确切的知识。”（着重点是我加的——孙）〔五〕
    显然，这是唯一正确的科学的认识论，这种认识论本身就强有力地给科学和革命事业开辟了极为广阔的道路。因为，既然物是不依赖于我们的意识、感觉而在我们之外存在着，那么，我们的认识就必须力求符合于在我们之外存在着的物或客观世界。这就给我们提出了在认识论上的主观与客观相符合的根本要求。既然在现象与物自体之间没有而且也不能有任何原则的差异，那末这就加强了人们对于经过实践证明了的科学知识的确信。既然在认识论上必须辩证地思考，这就不能不鼓舞着人们为追求客观真理而奋勇向前，使人们的科学知识日益丰富和日益深刻化起来。
    全世界的工人阶级及其先锋队——共产党和工人党，正是在正确地运用着这种科学的认识论，把客观真理，也就是客观事物的规律性作为我们的纲领、路线、方针、政策的客观的物质基础，从而进行着改造世界的巨大工作。
    而与此相反的认识论——实验主义的“认识论”，是在不承认物质第一性、意识第二性的前提之下而否认了客观真理的存在。因而他们的所谓“真理”是纯主观的。这样他们在认识论上就不能不陷于不可知论的泥坑。从这种不可知论出发詹姆士把人们带到了有神论：“我自己硬不信我们的人世经验就是宇宙里最高的经验了。我宁可相信我们人类对于全宇宙的关系就和我们的猫儿狗儿对于人世生活的关系一般。猫儿狗儿常在我们的客厅上书房里玩，他们也加入我们的生活，但他们全不懂得我们的生活的意义。我们的人世生活好比一个圆圈，他们就住在这个圆圈的正切线上，全不知道这个圆圈起于何处终于何处。我们也是如此。我们也住在这个全宇宙圆圈的正切线上。但是猫儿狗儿每日的生活可以证明他们有许多的理想和我们相同，所以我们照宗教经验的证据看来，也很可相信比人类更高的神力是实有的，并且这些神力也朝着人类理想中的方向努力拯救这个世界。”〔六〕
    这是一段令人发呕的话。但是，这却是现代的不可知论者关于世界是不可知的认识论的绝妙传神之笔。在这里，特别重要的是詹姆士的坚决否认客观真理，他绝望地企图把比人类更高的神力当作
  “实有的”东西，并且希望依靠这种神力朝着“人类理想中的方向”（就是垂死的资产阶级的理想的方向）拯救资本主义的世界。这正如列宁所说，不可知论者对于客观真理的否定，就不能不对于一切幽灵、魔鬼、天主教圣徒们大开其门（美帝国主义以梵蒂冈为它的反动支柱之一就是铁证）。在这种认识论的基础之上，实验主义者就不能不坚决反对客观真理，否认客观世界的规律性。因为这种规律性告诉我们，客观世界是在发展变化着，资本主义制度的必然被消灭，资本主义制度必然被社会主义制度所代替，美帝国主义的必然崩溃与灭亡，已经是历史地注定了的，这是客观真理。为帝国主义服务的哲学家詹姆士，又怎能不惧怕这样一条客观真理呢？又怎能不在客观世界的规律性面前颤栗呢？他不跑到不可知论的泥坑里喊叫，又会发出什么有力量的声音来呢？詹姆士所说的宇宙圆圈的正切线，不是别的，正是美帝国主义的死亡的边缘。
    只有当我们揭露了这一点的时候，我们才能深刻地理解到为什么胡适说“科学的律例是人造的，是假定的——是全靠他解释事实能不能满意，方才可定它是不是适用”的实际意义。作为帝国主义的奴才的胡适，所谓真理就是为美帝国主义或为旧中国的统治阶级服务的“真理”，为了帝国主义和蒋介石的利益，他是不能不反对任何客观真理的。
    问题很明白：承认世界的可知性，就承认客观真理，这就是马克思主义认识论的出发点，它本身就带来了我们的马克思主义哲学认识论的党派性。承认世界的不可知，承认主观“真理”，这就是实验主义的认识论的出发点，它本身也就同样地带来了实验主义哲学认识论的党派性。
    三、实验主义对绝对真理的否定和我们对绝对真理同相对真理的
        正确关系的分析
    列宁在批判俄国马赫主义者波格唐诺夫的时候，曾尖锐地指出波格唐诺夫把有没有客观真理的问题和关于绝对真理同相对真理的相互关系的问题相混淆。现在，实验主义者胡适，同样地重复着马赫主义者波格唐诺夫的错误。他企图玩弄否定永久真理的花样，来否定绝对真理的存在。
    胡适的话是这样的：“知道天下没有永久不变的真理，没有绝对的真理，方才可以起一种知识上的责任心……那绝对的真理是悬空的，是抽象的，是笼统的，是没有凭据的，是不能证实的。”〔七〕
      胡适在这里把永久不变的真理和绝对真理混为一谈，这不是出于无知，就是他的阴谋诡计。马克思主义认为所谓永久不变的真理，乃是历史上的反动统治阶级把对他们的统治有利的东西加以永久化、绝对化。至于绝对真理乃是指的真理的绝对性，是和真理的相对性紧密相联系的一个问题。正如列宁所说：“如果客观真理是有的，那末表现客观真理的人的表象能否一下子、完全地、无条件地、绝对地表现它，或者只能近似地、相对地表现它？这……是关于绝对真理与相对真理的相互关系问题。”〔八〕
      胡适所以要玩弄着否定永久真理的花样（其实，胡适是有他自己的永久真理的）来否定绝对真理，正是他的不承认客观真理的必然的逻辑结果；而我们马克思主义者之所以承认绝对真理，正是我们承认客观真理的必然的逻辑结果。列宁说过：
  “作一个唯物论者，就是说要承认我们的感觉器官所展示的客观真理。承认客观的、即不依存于人和人类的真理，就是说在这个或那个方式下承认绝对真理。”〔九〕
    胡适认为知道天下没有绝对的真理，方才可以起一种知识上的责任心，实际上，如果不承认有绝对的真理，那就要取消科学，消灭人类任何可能的知识上的责任心。胡适所说的绝对真理是悬空的，是抽象的，是笼统的，是没有凭据的，是不能证实的，那不过是他否认客观真理的一种方式而已。
    马克思主义的关于真理的完整的说法是：真理是客观的、绝对的而又是相对的，这是马克思主义关于真理的唯物论和辩证法。
    马克思主义坚持客观真理的理论，就必然坚持绝对真理的理论。它认为自然现象和社会现象都有它的绝对真理，绝对真理是客观存在着的。同时它又认为绝对真理不是人们一下子所能达到的。因之，在承认绝对真理的基础上，马克思主义又指出人们是通过相对真理逐渐接近绝对真理的。
    在人类认识的历史发展过程中的某一阶段上，对于某些事物的认识，只能有相对真理的意义，但是其中就包含有绝对真理的颗粒。例如对物质构造的问题，古代人们曾经认为是空气、水、火、土等元素构成的。当然，这是很朴素的猜测，然而，在这种猜测中已经包含着某些绝对真理的颗粒了。十七八世纪由于科学的发展，物理学家们认为物质是由原子构成的，原子是物质的不可分的最小的粒子。这种认识较之把空气、水、火、土等看作构成物质的元素，就包含更多的绝对真理的颗粒了。但是，十九世纪末二十世纪初，由于放射性元素的发现，使得能够把原子分裂开，从而人们的认识就深入到原子内部去，发现了原子内部的复杂的结构。这样，人们就认识了原子不是物质的不可分的最小的粒子，原子的内部还包含着质子、中子、电子、正子、介子、中微子等具有不同性质的小粒子。显然，这个伟大的发现，又使人们关于物质结构的认识，向着绝对真理大大前进了。但是，它还不是最后的绝对真理，而跟以前对于物质结构的认识一样，也还只有相对真理的意义。对于自然现象是如此，对于社会现象也是这样。
    由此可见，绝对真理和相对真理的关系的正确解决，乃是人们对于客观真理的认识的广度和深度的问题。人们的认识，不能够把客观世界的复杂情形一下子全面地、绝对地反映出来，但是它可能永远不断地，逐次地、相对地来接近它、反映它。真理的相对性就在于它是反映着在某一历史条件下人们所能够认识到的客观真理。所以任何相对真理都包含着绝对真理的颗粒。这就叫做相对之中有绝对。
    承认客观真理而又承认绝对真理和通过相对真理逐渐接近绝对真理的理论，在革命实践中是具有重大意义的。在这个理论的指引之下，人们就可以对于伟大的未来，抱着无限的热望，就可以使人们对于无穷无尽的客观真理贡献出最大的力量，去发现它，去追求它；在这个理论的指引之下，人们就可以永远地保持着谦逊谨慎的态度，在已发现的相对真理的基础上，不断地去接近绝对真理；当然，在这种理论的指引之下，人们还可以为了伟大的未来而紧紧地掌握着当前的现实，相信科学知识的确实性，相信党和国家当前的政策方针的现实性，而刻苦地、坚韧地为了明天而又全力地抓住今天。
    而实验主义者却竟然企图否认绝对真理。当然，它就不可能了解相对真理与绝对真理的关系，更不可能承认通过相对真理逐渐接近绝对真理的理论。在这里，我们还应指出实验主义的认识论，正和马赫主义的认识论是一样的，它们都是把相对论作为认识论的基础的。
    什么是相对论呢？简言之，就是把人们的认识的相对性这一因素加以绝对化。相对论本身不能不是形而上学的。从马克思主义观点看来，绝对同相对之间的对立也还是相对的，这就是说，既不可以把绝对的一面绝对化，也不可以把相对的一面绝对化，而是要辩证地把握它们。实验主义者既然把人们的认识的相对性绝对化起来，那么，它就不可能不陷入绝对怀疑论、不可知论和诡辩主义或者是主观主义。列宁说：“从赤裸裸的相对论底观点出发，可以证明任何诡辩是正确的”。〔十〕而在这里，詹姆士关于“一元多元”的诡辩，又给我们提出了铁的证据。他说：“从前的大病，在乎把多元的心理，看得非常害怕，以为多元便是捣乱，必有系统条理一致才好；其实换一个观点，把人的经验看作不断的意识之流，一元与多元便都有位置。……所以世界的一元多元，不成问题，而问题在于什么地方应用统一，什么地方应用多元。”〔十一〕好一个多元论，好一个相对论，该用多元用多元，该用一元用一元，这还有什么绝对真理之可言呢？
    显然，任何对绝对真理的否认，都不能不是相对论的观点，而相对论在理论上既然是诡辩的，从而在政治上就不能不为反动势力服务。
    正是在这个意义上，列宁的一段著名的话，就不能不成为马克思主义坚持不渝的原则，这段话就是：“辩证法，……包含着相对论、否定、怀疑论底契机，可是并不归结为相对论。马克思和恩格斯底唯物辩证法无条件地包含着相对论，可是并不归结为相对论，就是说，它不是在否定客观真理的意义上，而是在我们的知识对于这个真理的接近底界限底历史条件性的意义上，承认我们的一切知识底相对性。”〔十二〕（着重点是原来所有的）
  四、两种实践观和两种效果论
    我们现在还有必要研究一下检验真理的标准问题。关于这，实验主义者向马克思主义提出极尖锐的问题，那就是他们的“效果论”。胡适在转述詹姆士、杜威哲学的时候，曾反复地强调了实验主义的方法是着重实际效果的。他们所说的“效果”是什么呢？那就是用人造的假设来解释事物，看它解释的是否满意。他说：“实验主义绝不承认我们所谓‘真理’就是永永不变的天理；他只承认一切‘真理’都是应用的假设；假设的真不真，全靠他能不能发生他所应该发生的效果。这就是‘科学实验室的态度’。”〔十三〕“……律例原不过是人造的假设用来解释事物现象的，解释的满意，就是真的，解释的不满人意，便不是真的。”（着重点是我加的——孙）〔十四〕
    按照胡适的说法，解释得“满意”就有效果。那么，满意的标准到底是什么呢？是歪曲客观来服从主观的“满意”呢，还是主观和客观相一致的满意呢？因此，以什么来做满意的标准，就是这个问题的核心。显然，实验主义者的所谓“满意”只能是他主观上的满意，只能是歪曲客观来服从他的主观的“满意”，因为他们是根本不承认客观真理的。
    我们在上边曾经引用过的詹姆士所说的：用得着一元的时候就可以用一元，用得着多元的时候就可以用多元，这当然是在任何时候都可以解释得
  “满意”的。奴隶主剥削奴隶可以解释得“满意”；封建主压迫农奴可以解释得“满意”；资本家剥削工人可以解释得“满意”；华尔街老板要进行战争当然也可以解释得“满意”。即以胡适而论，把陈炯明说成革命的而把孙中山说成不革命的，可以解释得“满意”；拿阎锡山、何键的钱来为封建军阀说话，可以解释得“满意”；从美国回台湾投蒋介石一票，并把仅有的一点古物从台湾运到美国去，可以解释得“满意”；写文章、作演说反对共产党，反对中华人民共和国，借以从美帝国主义手里领点美元津贴来苟延残喘，维持垂死暮年，当然也可以解释得“满意”了！这正如列宁所说的：“对于唯物论者，人的实践底‘效果’证明着我们的表象与我们所感知的物底客观本性之符合。对于唯我论者，‘效果’是我在实践中所需要的一切，实践是可以同认识论分离开来的。”（着重点是我加的——孙）〔十五〕马克思主义认为只有实践才是检验真理的标准，只有实践才是认识论的基础。毛泽东同志在他的“实践论”一文中反复地论述过：只有实践才是检验认识的标准。认识只能来源于实践而又被实践所检验。这就是马克思主义认识论强大力量的源泉。
    因此，读者必须注意，实验主义所说的“效果”是不能和我们通常所说的效果混为一谈的。他们的“效果”是歪曲客观来符合主观的“效果”，他们的“效果”就是帝国主义利益的表现。而我们的效果是主观与客观相一致的效果，是全世界工人阶级和劳动人民利益的表现。
    两种实践，两种效果，这是我们应该和实验主义者截然分开的！
  五、科学与反科学的斗争
    在我们批判了实验主义的“真理论”的各个方面之后，最后还不能不提出关于科学和反科学的斗争的问题。只有辩证唯物主义的世界观、方法论、认识论，才能是唯一科学的世界观、方法论、认识论。理由很简单，这首先是在于它承认客观真理。在承认客观真理的基础之上才能产生真正的科学。而对于实验主义者来说，他们根本不承认客观真理，那也就没有任何科学可言了。实验主义者对于科学正如一切唯心论者一样，是窃取和歪曲自然科学的成果而作出对于他们有利的结论。马赫主义就是如此，实验主义也是如此。胡适歪曲科学成就，认为由于达尔文主义出现，旧的科学规律被废除了，新的科学规律被创造出来了。因此，他就作出科学规律是人造的结论。这正是最好的证明。而胡适对玄学鬼丁文江和玄学鬼张君劢的关于“科学”和人生观的论战，竟然把科学的标签贴在玄学鬼丁文江的前额上，那更是最好的证明。
    实验主义的反对科学本身，就必然要走上信仰主义的道路。而胡适的“我的宗教”（“不朽”）一文恰恰又说明了他正是通向信仰主义。在胡适身上，是根本没有什么科学可言的。尽管他在这一方面装腔作势地说詹姆士是宗教家的儿子，而在实际上，胡适也恰恰就是这个宗教家的儿子的后裔。
    因此，在清算胡适思想流毒的时候，为保卫科学而斗争，不能不是我们的神圣任务。
