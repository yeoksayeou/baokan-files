Two Hydroelectric Power Stations to be Built in the Yellow River Irrigation Area

Starting this year, the state will build two hydroelectric power stations at the No. 1 and No. 3 drop structures on the main canal of the Yellow River Irrigation Area in Henan Province. By the end of this year, four generators will be installed in the No. 1 power station and will begin generating electricity. The establishment of the hydroelectric power stations will bring a new atmosphere to agricultural production in the Yellow River Irrigation Area. Ten electric pumping stations will transform more than 70,000 mu of high-lying land into paddy fields, and turn more than 90,000 mu of saline-alkali land into fertile fields. Along with the establishment of the hydroelectric power stations, electric cotton ginning factories, baling factories, and oil mills will also be established in the Yellow River Irrigation Area. Some rural areas around the hydroelectric power stations will also be able to obtain electricity for lighting. At present, site exploration and construction preparation work have been completed, and the mechanical equipment and construction work of the power stations are being prepared.

    引黄灌溉区将建两座水力发电站
    从今年起，国家将要在河南省引黄灌溉区总干渠上的一、三号跌水处，兴建两座水力发电站。今年年底，一号发电站要安装好四部发电机，开始发电。水电站建立后，将给引黄灌溉区的农业生产带来新的气象。十处电力抽水机站，将使七万余亩高岗地变成水田，把九万余亩盐碱地变成良田。随着水电站的建立，引黄灌溉区内还将要建立电力轧花厂、打包厂和油厂。围绕水电站的部分农村也能得到照明用电。当前，地址勘察和施工准备工作都已做好，发电站的机械设备和建站工作都正在准备。
