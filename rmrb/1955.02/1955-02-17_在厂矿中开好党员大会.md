Holding Good Party Member Congresses in Factories and Mines

According to the Party Constitution, the Party Member Congress is the highest leading body of a Party grassroots organization. To enable every Party member to discuss and decide on all major issues in the Party's organizational life and work at the Party Member Congress, and to be able to offer criticisms and suggestions on leadership work, is the most important way for the Party's grassroots organizations to promote democracy and give play to the enthusiasm and creativity of Party members. In the past, in the grassroots Party organizations in factories and mines, democratic life was not normal enough, and Party members rarely had the opportunity to participate in and inspect the Party's leadership work. Most grassroots organizations' Party Member Congresses, apart from conducting branch elections and accepting new Party members, were no different from general work meetings. At the Party Member Congresses, only plans were announced and work was assigned, and few important issues concerning the Party organization's guarantee and supervision of production were raised for discussion. The time of the congress was almost entirely taken up by lengthy reports from a few leading cadres, and Party members actually had very little opportunity to speak. The enthusiasm and creativity of Party members could not be fully utilized, and the Party organization could not use the collective strength of the Party to guarantee and supervise production. This is a basic reason why many Party organizations' guarantee and supervision of production were not strong and effective enough.

Since last year, this situation has changed significantly. Many Party organizations in factories and mines have begun to bring important issues in current production to the Party Member Congress for discussion, mobilizing Party members to offer opinions and criticisms on these issues, and truly playing a mass supervisory role. When the broad masses of Party members are indeed able to discuss and decide on the Party's work at the Party Member Congresses, they will, proceeding from the needs of production and the demands of the masses, offer many practical and beneficial suggestions for the Party's work to compensate for the limitations of a few leading cadres' considerations, and at the same time, sharply expose the shortcomings and errors in the work from various angles, offer suggestions for improvement, and assist the leadership in continuously improving the work. Moreover, when Party members have provided opinions on the issues that the Party organization wants to solve, passed resolutions, and offered criticisms of the shortcomings in the Party's work, thus improving the work, they will naturally closely link their personal activities with the cause of the Party and specifically feel that they are inseparable from the cause of the Party, and they will consciously be responsible for the correctness of the Party's resolutions and fight to realize them.

The ultimate goal of all the work carried out by Party organizations in factories and mines is to guarantee and supervise the comprehensive fulfillment of the state plan by the units they are in. Therefore, issues related to the completion of production plans are the issues that all Party members are most concerned about and that the Party Member Congress should frequently discuss. However, the Party organization's method of guaranteeing the completion of production tasks is not to directly handle the administrative management and technical issues in daily production, but to guarantee and supervise production by strengthening political and ideological leadership, that is, by raising the communist consciousness of Communist Party members, raising the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers, by establishing correct ideological styles and criticizing various bad tendencies, and by checking the implementation of the Party's policies and guidelines, and other measures, to promote Communist Party members and all workers in factories and mines to work hard to complete the plan. The Party organization should widely and proactively pay attention to various ideological and work style issues among workers related to the completion of the state plan and the implementation of the Party's policies and guidelines, issues of advanced or backward ideological styles, and pay attention to important issues in the Party's ideological and organizational construction. If the Party organization selects issues from these aspects and submits them to the Party Member Congress for discussion, it can guide the attention of Party members to the issues that are most meaningful for strengthening the Party's work and completing the state plan, and it can ensure that the Party Member Congress not only does not replace production meetings and administrative meetings, but also prepares a good ideological foundation for holding these meetings well. In the Party organizations in factories and mines, there are many, many issues that need to be brought to the Party Member Congress for discussion. However, at present, apart from work plans and summaries, most of the issues discussed by many Party organizations at the Party Member Congresses are the so-called key issues in the current month's production. Moreover, the methods of discussing these issues are not much different from production meetings and administrative meetings, and most of them are discussed from the aspects of administrative management and technical issues, and few discuss policy guidelines and ideological style issues that are closely related to production. As a result, the Party Member Congress replaces or duplicates general administrative meetings and mass meetings, and cannot become an important way to promote democracy and implement the Party's guarantee and supervision of production. The main reason for this shortcoming is naturally that many Party organization workers in factories and mines lack experience in this area, but it is also because some Party workers have a mechanical and formalistic understanding of how the Party guarantees and supervises production. They believe that as long as Party members directly solve the administrative management and technical issues in production at Party meetings, and the Party makes resolutions, and even relies on the binding force of the Party's resolutions and the Party's organizational discipline to promote Party members to ensure the completion of tasks, this is the most practical and effective guarantee and supervision of production. In reality, doing so will inevitably weaken the Party's ideological work, restrict the development of democracy within the Party, and not only will it not promote administrative work and trade union work, but it will also affect the enthusiasm of administrative and trade union workers.

The Party Member Congress should be conducted in an atmosphere of full democracy. The Party Member Congress is a forum for Party members to express their opinions to the Party. Therefore, Party members should be able to express their opinions without any worries. Do not be afraid that Party members will raise opinions that differ from those of the leaders, and do not be afraid of disagreements and disputes. On the contrary, encourage everyone to offer opinions from different angles and展开讨论。Only in this way can we pool the wisdom of the masses and reduce the subjectivity and one-sidedness of the Party organization in making decisions. It is necessary for the branch committee members to formulate topics before convening the Party Member Congress so that the congress can discuss around certain issues. However, do not restrict Party members from raising issues outside the scope of the topics. If someone raises an important issue that everyone is very concerned about, it can also be discussed at the Party Member Congress. In this regard, many branch leading cadres often lack a democratic style and do not pay attention to the issues raised by Party members outside the agenda, which should be noted. In addition, at the Party Member Congress, special attention should be paid to encouraging and guiding those Party members who do not often speak to speak, and do not only focus on the few active members who often speak. Do not think that people who do not often speak are people who have no opinions. It should be recognized that there are still many Party members who are not used to speaking at meetings and are not good at expressing their opinions at meetings. Party workers should often care for them, help them, and encourage them to boldly express their opinions. We should pay attention to protecting their enthusiasm for speaking, and not allow them to be ridiculed for their shortcomings in their speeches. Many Party organizations are not concerned enough about this part of the comrades. Some Party organizations use the method of group electing representatives to speak at the Party Member Congress. If it is indeed a part of the Party members who have voluntarily elected one or two people to be their representatives after democratic deliberation, there is certainly nothing wrong with it. However, this method must never be regarded as the only way and the main way to speak at the Party Member Congress. If so, it is easy to form a group of special "speakers" within the Party, while most Party members do not have the opportunity to fully express their opinions.

The key to whether criticism and self-criticism can be fully carried out at the Party Member Congress lies in the spirit of self-criticism and the attitude of accepting criticism of leading cadres. This truth is well known, but it is not something that every leading cadre can truly achieve. The self-criticisms made by many leading cadres at the Party Member Congress are just empty sentences such as: "Political and ideological work is weak," "The role of guarantee and supervision has not been fully played," "Combat effectiveness is not strong," "There is a bureaucratic work style," or "The leadership has a great responsibility," etc., that do not touch on practical issues. Obviously, such a "self-examination" not only cannot inspire the masses to encourage the masses to make criticisms of the leaders, but also makes the masses doubt whether the leaders have the sincerity and courage to accept criticism and improve their work. There are also similar situations in the treatment of the criticisms of the masses. Some leading cadres only welcome the opinions of the masses in words, but they are not willing to actively think of ways to make the opinions of the masses have a concrete effect. There are even a few leading cadres who, to varying degrees, retaliate against the critics. These are obstacles to carrying out criticism and self-criticism. Party leading cadres should not only remove these obstacles, but also gradually establish such an atmosphere through all aspects of their work: to make everyone regard conducting criticism and self-criticism, especially criticizing the leaders, as an indispensable and important aspect of the Party's life. Only in this way can criticism and self-criticism be carried out smoothly at the Party Member Congress.

The Party organization cannot only isolate itself in the Party Member Congress to promote democracy and listen to the opinions of the masses. The Party organization should always pay attention to strengthening the connection between leading cadres and general Party members and non-Party masses. The doors of the Party Committee should be open to the masses so that Party members and non-Party masses are willing to come here to talk about the issues they are concerned about. Do not make the Party Committee a special conference hall, and do not make the Party Secretary and members busy with meetings all day long, so that Party members always encounter meetings when they come to the Party Committee, actually canceling the daily contact between the Party Committee and the masses. It should be recognized that one of the greatest characteristics of the work style of Party workers is to maintain close contact with the masses. These comrades should strive to get close to life and spend more time meeting with the masses and talking to them. Party workers should use a humble attitude and high enthusiasm to discuss issues with the masses, listen to their opinions on the leaders, understand their difficulties and hardships, and patiently help them solve various problems in production, life, thinking, and learning. They should make themselves the close and intimate friends that the masses are most willing to be close to, and not become the "bosses" that the masses fear. Only in this way can the life within the Party be enlivened, and the preparation work for the Party Member Congress, the discussions at the meeting, and the implementation and inspection of the resolutions after the meeting can be carried out smoothly under conditions of full democracy. However, a part of our Party workers are precisely very lacking in this mass work style. They think that they have fully promoted democracy by convening the Party Member Congress. Before and after the Party Member Congress, they are always sitting in the office holding this and that meeting and rarely meet with the masses, and even resent the masses talking to them, thinking that this will hinder their "work." Even if they meet with the masses, they rarely listen patiently to the opinions of the masses, but are used to issuing orders to the masses, and only allow them to criticize the masses and not allow the masses to criticize them. If Party workers cannot resolve to correct this high-handed and detached from the masses master attitude, then no matter how loudly they shout about promoting democracy at the Party Member Congress or other meetings, the masses will still stay away from them.

At present, many Party organizations are only satisfied with the fact that the Party Member Congress has certain forms of promoting democracy compared to the past, such as electing a presidium at the meeting, having everyone raise their hands to pass resolutions, etc., thinking that as long as there are these forms, the Party Member Congress is promoting democracy. This idea is very harmful. At any time, no matter how good the form is, if it does not have practical content, it will not play a decisive role in things. The Party organization should abandon this harmful idea and seriously improve its work and style from all the above aspects so that the Party Member Congress can truly promote democracy and give play to the Party's collective strength and wisdom.

### 在厂矿中开好党员大会

    在厂矿中开好党员大会
    按照党章的规定，党员大会是党的基层组织的最高领导机关。使每一个党员都能在党员大会上讨论和决定党的组织生活和工作中的各种重大问题，都能对领导工作提出批评和建议，这是党的基层组织发扬民主、发挥党员积极性和创造性的最重要的形式。过去，在厂矿的基层党组织中，民主生活不够正常，党员群众很少机会参与并检查党的领导工作。大多数基层组织的党员大会除了进行支部的选举和接受新党员等工作以外，和一般的工作会议没有什么区别。在党员大会上只是宣布计划和布置工作，很少提出党组织在保证监督生产方面的重要问题来进行讨论。大会的时间几乎完全被少数领导干部的冗长的报告占去，党员们实际上很少有发言的机会。党员的积极性和创造性不能充分发挥，党组织不能运用党的集体力量对生产进行保证监督，这是很多党组织对生产的保证监督不够坚强有力的一个基本原因。
    去年以来，这种情况有了很大的改变。厂矿里的许多党组织开始把当前生产中的重要问题提到党员大会上来讨论，发动党员群众对这些问题提出意见和批评，真正发挥了群众性的监督作用。当广大的党员群众确实能够在党员大会上讨论和决定党的工作时，他们就会从生产的需要和群众的要求出发，对党的工作提出很多切实有益的意见，以弥补少数领导干部考虑问题时的局限性，同时尖锐地从各个角度去揭发工作中的缺点和错误，提出改进的意见，协助领导不断改进工作。而且，当党员群众对党组织要解决的问题提供了意见，通过了决议，对党的工作中的缺点提出了批评，因而使工作得到改进时，他们自然就会把个人的活动和党的事业紧密联系起来，具体地感觉到自己和党的事业不可分割，他们也就会自觉地对党的决议的正确性负责，为实现党的决议而斗争。
    厂矿里党组织进行一切工作的最后目的，都是为了保证和监督所在单位全面地完成国家计划。因此，有关完成生产计划的问题就是全体党员所最关心的问题，也是党员大会应该经常讨论的问题。但是，党组织保证完成生产任务的方法，不是直接动手去处理日常生产中的行政管理和技术问题，而是用加强政治思想领导的方法来保证和监督生产，就是用提高共产党员的共产主义觉悟，提高广大职工群众的积极性和创造性，用树立正确的思想作风和批判各种不良倾向，用检查党的政策方针的执行情况等办法，去推动厂矿中的共产党员以及全体职工来努力完成计划。党组织应该广泛地有预见性地注意职工中有关完成国家计划和贯彻党的政策方针的各种思想作风问题，先进的思想作风或者落后的思想作风问题，注意党的思想建设和组织建设中的重要问题。党组织从这些方面来选择问题交给党员大会讨论，就可以把党员的注意引导到对于加强党的工作和完成国家计划最有意义的问题上来，就可以使党员大会不但不代替生产会议和行政会议，而且可以为开好这些会议准备下良好的思想基础。在厂矿党组织中，需要提到党员大会上讨论的问题是很多很多的。但是，目前，很多党组织在党员大会上讨论的除了工作计划和总结以外，大多是当月生产中的所谓关键问题。而且讨论这些问题的方法和生产会议行政会议没有多大区别，大都从行政管理工作和技术问题方面进行讨论，很少讨论和生产密切有关的政策方针问题和思想作风问题。这样做的结果，就使党员大会代替或重复了一般的行政会议和群众会议，而不能成为发扬民主，对生产实行全党的保证监督的一个重要方式。发生这种缺点的主要原因自然在于很多厂矿党组织的工作人员缺乏这方面的经验，但是也由于有些党工作人员对于党如何保证监督生产有着机械的形式主义的理解，他们以为只要党员在党的会议上直接解决生产中的行政管理和技术问题，并且由党来作出决议，甚至依靠党的决议的约束力量和党的组织纪律来推动党员保证完成任务，这就是对生产的最切实有效的保证监督。实际上这样做的结果势必会削弱党的思想工作，限制党内民主的发扬，而且不但不会推动行政工作和工会工作，还会影响行政和工会工作者的积极性。
    应该使党员大会在充分的民主空气中进行。党员大会是党员群众向党发表自己的意见的讲坛，因此，应该使党员们能够毫无顾虑地发表自己的意见。不要害怕党员们提出和领导者不同的意见，不要害怕分歧和争论。相反地，要鼓励大家从各个不同的角度提出意见展开讨论。只有这样，才能集中群众的智慧，才能减少党组织在决定问题时的主观性和片面性。在召开党员大会之前，支部委员们拟定议题，使大会围绕一定的问题进行讨论，这是必要的。但是，不要限制党员们提出议题范围以外的问题。如果有人提出了大家十分关心的重要问题，同样可以在党员大会上进行讨论。在这一点上，很多支部领导干部常常缺乏民主作风，不重视党员们在议题以外提出的问题，这是应该引起注意的。另外，在党员大会上应该特别注意鼓励和引导那些不常讲话的党员发言，不要把眼睛只看在少数经常发言的积极分子身上。不要以为不常发言的人就是没有意见的人。应该认识到，还有不少党员不习惯于在大会上发言，不善于在大会上表达自己的意见。党的工作人员应该经常关心他们帮助他们，鼓励他们大胆发表自己的意见。要注意保护他们发言的积极性，不要使他们因发言有缺点而遭到别人的嘲笑奚落。很多党组织对于这一部分同志还关心得很不够。有些党组织在党员大会上采用小组选举代表发言的办法，如果确实是一部分党员经过民主酝酿，自愿选举一个两个人做他们的代表，当然也没有什么坏处。但是，决不能把这种方法当成在党员大会上发言的唯一方式和主要方式。如果这样，就容易在党内形成一批专门的“发言人”，而大多数的党员却没有充分发表意见的机会。
    在党员大会上能否充分地开展批评和自我批评的关键在于领导干部的自我批评精神和接受批评的态度。这个道理是人所共知的，但是却不是每一个领导干部都能真正做到的。很多领导干部在党员大会上进行的自我批评只是些：“政治思想工作薄弱”、“保证监督作用没有充分发挥”、“战斗性不强”、“有官僚主义作风”或者是“领导方面有很大责任”等等一类的空洞的不接触实际问题的辞句。很明显，这样的“自我检讨”不但不能启发群众鼓励群众来对领导提出批评，而且会使群众怀疑领导者究竟有没有接受批评改进工作的诚意和勇气。在对待群众的批评上也有类似的情况。有些领导干部只是口头上欢迎群众的意见，但是却不肯积极地想办法使群众的意见发生具体的效果。甚至还有少数领导干部程度不同地给批评者以打击报复。这些都是开展批评和自我批评的障碍。党的领导干部不仅应该扫除这些障碍，而且应该通过各方面的工作逐渐树立这么一种风气：使大家把进行批评和自我批评，特别是对领导者进行批评当成党的生活中必不可少的一个重要方面。只有这样，批评和自我批评才能在党员大会上通畅无阻地开展起来。
    党组织不能只孤立地在党员大会上去发扬民主、听取群众意见。党组织在任何时候都应该注意加强领导干部和一般党员以及非党群众的联系。党委员会的门应该向群众敞开着，使党员以及非党群众都愿意来这里谈他们所关心的问题。不要使党委员会成为专门会议厅，不要使党委书记和委员成天忙于开会，使党员群众到党委员会来时总是碰上开会，实际上取消了党委和群众的日常联系。应该认识到，党的工作人员作风的一个最大特点就是和群众保持密切的联系。这些同志应该努力接近生活，用更多的时间去接见群众，去找群众谈心。党的工作人员要用谦逊的态度和高度的热情，去和群众商量问题，听取他们对领导者的意见，了解他们的困难和疾苦，耐心地帮助他们解决生产、生活、思想、学习中的各种问题。要使自己成为群众最愿意亲近的知心的朋友，而不要成为群众望而生畏的“上司”。只有这样，党内的生活才能活跃起来，党员大会的准备工作、会上讨论以及会后对决议的贯彻和检查，才能在充分民主条件下顺利进行。但是，我们有一部分党工作人员恰恰十分缺乏这种群众作风。他们以为召开了党员大会，就充分发扬了民主，他们在党员大会召开前后都是经常坐在办公室里开这样那样的会议而很少和群众见面谈心，甚至厌烦群众找他们谈话，认为这会妨碍了他们的“工作”。他们即使和群众见了面，也很少耐心地倾听群众意见，而是习惯于向群众发号施令，而且只许他们批评群众而不许群众批评他们。党的工作人员如果不能决心改正这种高高在上的脱离群众的老爷态度，那么，不管他们在党员大会或者别的会议上怎样高喊发扬民主，群众还是要远远地离开他们。
    目前，很多党组织仅仅满足于党员大会比过去具备了某些发扬民主的形式，比如开会要选主席团，通过决议要大家举手等等，认为只要有了这些形式，党员大会就是发扬了民主。这种想法是十分有害的。任何时候，不管多好的形式，如果它没有实际的内容的话，都不会对事物起决定的作用。党组织应该丢掉这种有害的想法，认真地从以上各个方面来改进自己的工作和作风，使党员大会能够真正发扬民主，发挥党的集体力量和智慧。
