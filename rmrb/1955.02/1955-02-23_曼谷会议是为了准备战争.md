The Bangkok Conference is for Preparing for War
    Hu Jin
    Under the planning of the United States, the participating countries of the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" (United States, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Philippines and Pakistan) are holding a meeting in Bangkok today. Western news agencies and newspapers are constantly revealing that major conspiracies to prepare for war and promote colonialism are unfolding around this conference. It is particularly noteworthy that the Bangkok Conference is closely related to the provocative and aggressive steps recently taken by the United States in Asia.
    The official notices issued by the United States and other treaty participating countries state that the purpose of the Bangkok Conference is to "discuss ways to implement the Manila Treaty" and to "exchange views on issues related to the peace and security of the treaty area." A slight observation of the facts shows that the purpose of this meeting has nothing in common with the peace and security of this region. According to the United States' plan, the Bangkok Conference is to further materialize this Southeast Asia Treaty Organization—an aggressive military group organization—or, in their favorite words, to put on "teeth" to play its role as a war tool of the United States. Obviously, this is a major threat to peace in Asia.
    Long before the Bangkok Conference was convened, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles had already made public the U.S. plan. The main part of this plan is to establish a "mobile attack force" and set up a "permanent command." According to sources, the United States requires that this army be mainly composed of the "joint naval and military forces" of the three colonial countries of the United States, Britain and France, and other countries participating in the treaty should also undertake various military obligations, including providing certain armed forces and military bases.
    The "New York Times" of the United States revealed that the Manila Treaty "Military Committee that the United States intends to organize may take the form of a joint staff of military representatives from the eight signatory countries. These military representatives will study at regular meetings the obligations that each country can undertake for the defense of the region—the manpower provided by Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines; the naval and air forces and manpower provided by France, Britain, Australia, and New Zealand; and the naval and air forces provided by the United States. This committee or staff will draft a plan according to which a joint command can be established in times of emergency."
    The organizers of this aggressive group are doing their best to promote that the Southeast Asia Treaty is for the "defense" of Southeast Asian countries and the "protection" of the security of these countries; but this hypocritical statement has long gone bankrupt. Judging from the above facts, this treaty is cast from the mold of war. The military group organization established to implement this treaty is for splitting Asia, preparing for war, and maintaining colonialism. The public opinion in Southeast Asian countries has a clear estimate of this, and they correctly determine that the United States' activities of organizing military groups are "a challenge to the independence and self-esteem of the Asian people" (comment from India's "Free Press Journal") and that the United States is "actually creating war" (comment from Myanmar's "New Light of Burma").
    The aggressive activities intensified by the United States in the months since the Manila Conference have more clearly proved this assertion. At present, the United States' spearhead of aggression in this region is first pointing at the People's Republic of China.
    The United States originally wanted to include Taiwan in the "treaty area" of the Southeast Asia Treaty in order to drag its partners into a military adventure against the People's Republic of China. Although this clause was not passed at the Manila Conference due to various factors, Dulles repeatedly stated publicly after the United States signed a war treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group that the U.S.-Chiang Treaty would be linked with the Southeast Asia Treaty and other military treaties to form a "common security system" encircling the People's Republic of China from the Aleutian Islands to the South Pacific. This shows that no matter what happened at that meeting, the United States has not changed its mind in the slightest about dragging the Southeast Asia Treaty participating countries into its activities to invade China.
    Now, the United States is further attempting to use the Bangkok Conference to expand its armed intervention in the People's Republic of China and to tightly bind its partners to the United States' aggressive policy. Agence France-Presse reported that "it is expected that at the meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Dulles will try to persuade other members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to link the security of Southeast Asia with the U.S. strategy in the Taiwan Strait." Eden also confirmed before leaving for the Bangkok Conference that the Taiwan issue will be discussed "informally" at the Bangkok Conference. The Chinese people are extremely indignant at any foreign interference in our liberation of our own territory of Taiwan, and believe that participation in such interference in any form is an act of hostility towards the Chinese people.
    In addition, the United States also wants to achieve another major goal through the Bangkok Conference: to undermine the Geneva Accords. The U.S. aggressive activities in interfering in the situation in Indochina have recently become even more blatant. It has not only instigated South Vietnam to violate the provisions of the armistice agreement regarding guaranteeing democratic freedoms, but also attempted to obstruct the realization of the general elections in the three countries of Indochina stipulated in the Geneva Accords. The military, political and economic plan formulated by Collins, the U.S. President's special envoy to South Vietnam, to split Vietnam and turn South Vietnam into a second South Korea, has been approved by Washington and is being gradually implemented.
    As everyone knows, the United States has disregarded the Geneva Conference agreement on restoring peace in Indochina and included Laos, Cambodia, and southern Vietnam in the scope of countries and territories specially applicable to the Manila Treaty, which is actually to drag these countries into a military alliance and turn them into U.S. military bases. Now, the U.S. interventionists are doing their best to achieve this goal in order to rekindle the flames of war in this region. Laos has been invited to attend the Bangkok Conference in the name of "observer," which is the first step into this military group, and thus further violates the Geneva Conference agreement that the three countries of Indochina shall not participate in military alliances. But Dulles is not satisfied with this, and he also announced that he would go to Indochina to carry out activities after participating in the Bangkok Conference. The U.S. conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Accords is becoming increasingly obvious.
    Western news shows that behind the smokescreen of so-called "opposing communist aggression" and "preventing subversive activities," the Bangkok Conference also hides another "urgent" task, which is to try to drag some Asian countries into the Southeast Asia Treaty Group, while applying various pressures to those countries that are unwilling to be hooked, attempting to force them to abandon their independent and autonomous policies and accept U.S. command. The planners of the Southeast Asia aggressive group indicated that they are panicked and uneasy about the major countries that account for four-fifths of the total population of Southeast Asia that have been refusing to participate in this group that is falsely named "Southeast Asia," especially about the upcoming Asian-African Conference in Bandung. Therefore, they first clamored that it is necessary to "resist" the Asian-African Conference, and then said that it must be
   "influenced" and try to sabotage it from within. This fully proves that the United States' hostility towards the friendly cooperation between the Asian and African people is deeply rooted. Any country that is truly committed to maintaining peace and freedom and independence is not tolerated by the United States' aggressive policies and war policies.
    In order to put a "charitable" appearance on the United States' "power" policy, Dulles said that the Bangkok Conference would discuss the issue of "economic welfare," that is, the so-called promotion of "economic development" of Southeast Asian countries touted by the Manila Treaty. It is not difficult to see through what kind of trick a robber is playing when he has a good heart. Various propaganda machines of the United States have long openly admitted that what the United States really cares about are the strategic raw materials abundant in this region, such as tin, oil, rubber, iron, sand, etc., and that countries should continue to implement "embargoes" that damage their economies so that the United States can control their markets.
    All of the above facts thoroughly expose the conspiratorial purposes of the Bangkok Conference, which are completely contrary to the wishes of hundreds of millions of people in Southeast Asia and Asian countries, and will bring new war threats to peace in the Far East and Southeast Asia. It has already, and will continue to arouse the firm opposition of the Asian people.
    It must be pointed out that the Manila Treaty was established by the United States with the support of Britain. Without Britain's support, the United States would not have been able to carry out aggression so easily in Asia, organize aggressive military groups, and endanger peace in Asia. However, on many important issues, Britain insists on continuing to follow the United States' aggressive policies and war policies, causing the British people to suffer the threat of war and making the Asian people more clearly recognize that Britain is still trying its best to maintain its colonial rule over the Asian people. This path of Britain is obviously not feasible. The British people cannot allow this to happen, and neither can the Asian people. In fact, Britain is trying to maintain its colonial control over Asia by following the United States, while the United States is relying on Britain's support to replace Britain's colonial position in Asia. No matter how they try to cover up this contradiction of imperialism, it will continue to develop.
    Everyone can see that the United States' plan to put together military groups in Asia to prepare for war is being met with massive and firm resistance from the people of Southeast Asia and Asia. All the efforts of the United States and its followers to change the notorious situation of the Southeast Asia Treaty have not been successful. Major Southeast Asian countries have refused to join the Southeast Asia Treaty. India's "Free News" on February 24 said: "India and other free countries in the region are unwilling to participate in alliances in the style of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization for a very simple reason: they believe in harmonious diplomacy and solemn declarations of peace and non-interference." "Ceylon Times" also solemnly stated when commenting on the Bangkok Conference: "All countries that guarantee not to be involved in any group of countries must continue to have nothing to do with it." These all reflect the profound desire of the Asian people to maintain peace and oppose war groups. This profound desire cannot be ignored by anyone and cannot be intimidated by any war activities. The Asian people will fight to the end to maintain peace and oppose war.

    曼谷会议是为了准备战争
    胡今
    在美国的策划下，“东南亚集体防务条约”参加国（美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、泰国、菲律宾和巴基斯坦），今天在曼谷举行会议。西方通讯社和报刊不断透露，各种准备战争推行殖民主义的重大阴谋活动正在围绕这一会议而展开来。特别值得注意的是，曼谷会议和美国最近在亚洲采取的挑衅性的侵略步骤，有着密切的关联。
    美国和其他参加条约国家发出的正式通告说，曼谷会议的目的，是“讨论执行马尼拉条约的办法”，并就所谓“关系条约地区的和平和安全的问题交换意见”。只要略微观察一下事实，就可以看出，这个会议的目的实际上跟这个地区的和平和安全毫无共同之处。按照美国的打算，曼谷会议要把这个东南亚条约组织——侵略性的军事集团组织进一步具体化，或者用他们自己所爱用的话：装上“牙齿”，以发挥它作为美国的战争工具的作用。显然，这是对亚洲和平的重大威胁。
    早在召开曼谷会议之前，美国国务卿杜勒斯就已把美国的计划公开了出来。这个计划的主要部分是建立一支“机动的攻击力量”，并且设立一个“常设司令部”。据消息透露，美国要求这支军队主要由美英法三个殖民国家的“联合的海军和军事力量”组成，其他参加条约的国家也要承担各种军事义务，包括提供一定的武装部队和军事基地。
    美国“纽约时报”透露说：美国打算组织的马尼拉条约“军事委员会可能采取八个签字国军事代表联合参谋部的形式。这些军事代表在定期的会议上将研究每一个国家对该区防务所能承担的义务——巴基斯坦、泰国和菲律宾所出的人力；法国、英国、澳大利亚和新西兰所出的海空军和人力；美国所出的海空军。这个委员会或参谋部将拟出一个计划，根据这个计划，在紧急时期内可以设立一个联合司令部”。
    这个侵略集团的组织者竭力宣传东南亚条约是为了东南亚国家的“防务”，是对这些国家的安全的“保护”；但这个虚伪说法早就破产了。从上面的事实看，这个条约是从战争的模子中铸造出来的。为了实施这个条约而成立的军事集团组织，是为了分裂亚洲、准备战争和维护殖民主义。对于这点，东南亚各国舆论是有清醒的估计的，它们把美国这一组织军事集团的活动正确地断定为“对亚洲人民的独立和自尊的一种挑战”（印度“自由新闻报”的评论），是美国“实际上在制造战争”（缅甸“新光报”的评论）。
    马尼拉会议以后的这几个月中，美国加紧进行的侵略活动，更清楚地证明了这种论断。目前，美国在这个地区的侵略矛头首先是指着中华人民共和国。
    美国原来是要把台湾包括在东南亚条约的“条约区域”之内，以便把它的伙伴拖入对中华人民共和国的军事冒险中去。虽然这一条款因为各种因素而没有在马尼拉会议上通过，但美国同蒋介石卖国集团签订战争条约后，杜勒斯一再公开说，美蒋条约将同东南亚条约和其他军事条约联结在一起，形成从阿留申群岛到南太平洋的包围中华人民共和国的“共同安全体系”。这说明，不管那次会上发生了什么事情，美国丝毫也没有改变它要把东南亚条约参加国家卷到它侵略中国的活动中来的主意。
    现在，美国正在进一步企图利用曼谷会议来扩大对中华人民共和国的武装干涉，把它的伙伴紧紧地束缚在美国这个侵略政策上面。法新社报道说“预料在会议举行时，美国国务卿杜勒斯将设法劝说东南亚条约组织的其他成员国把东南亚的安全和美国在台湾海峡的战略联系起来。”艾登启程出席曼谷会议之前也证实曼谷会议将“非正式”讨论台湾问题。中国人民对于任何外国干涉我们解放自己的领土台湾都感到极度的愤慨，并认为不论以什么形式参加这种干涉就是对中国人民的敌视行为。
    除此以外，美国还想通过曼谷会议来达到另外一个重大目的：破坏日内瓦协议。美国干涉印度支那局势的侵略活动，近来是更加放肆了。它不仅唆使南越违反停战协定关于保证民主自由的条款，而且企图阻挠日内瓦协议规定的印度支那三个国家的普选的实现。美国总统驻南越特使柯林斯拟定的分裂越南、把南越变为南朝鲜第二的军事、政治和经济计划，已得到华盛顿的批准，并已在逐步付诸实施。
    大家知道，美国已经不顾日内瓦会议关于恢复印度支那和平的协议，把老挝、柬埔寨和越南南部划入马尼拉条约特予适用的国家和领土范围之内，实际上就是要把这些国家拖进军事联盟中去，变成美国的军事基地。现在，美国干涉者正在竭力企图实现这一目的，以便在这一地区重新燃起战火。老挝已以“观察员”的名义应邀出席曼谷会议，这就是进入这个军事集团的第一步，从而也就是进一步违反了日内瓦会议关于印度支那三国不得参加军事同盟的协议的行为。但是杜勒斯还不以此为满足，他还宣布他参加曼谷会议后还要到印度支那去进行活动。美国企图破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋是越来越明显了。
    西方消息显示，曼谷会议在所谓“反对共产党侵略”和“防止颠覆活动”的烟幕后面，还掩藏着另外的“紧急”任务，那就是设法把一些亚洲国家拉进东南亚条约集团，同时对那些不愿上钩的国家加施各种压力，企图迫使它们放弃独立自主的政策，接受美国的驱使。东南亚侵略集团的策划者表明，它对于占东南亚总人口五分之四的主要国家一直拒绝参加这个冒名为“东南亚”的集团，特别是对于即将在万隆举行的亚非会议，感到惶恐不安。因而，先是叫嚷必须“抵制”亚非会议，后来又说必须加以
  “影响”并设法从内部去进行破坏。这完全证明美国仇视亚非人民的友好合作是根深蒂固的。任何国家真正致力于维护和平和自由独立，都是美国的侵略政策和战争政策所不能容许的。
    为了替美国这种“实力”政策戴上“慈善”的外貌，杜勒斯说曼谷会议要讨论“经济福利”问题，亦即马尼拉条约所标榜的所谓促进东南亚国家的
  “经济发展”问题。强盗起善心，这究竟是什么把戏，是不难看破的。美国各种各样的宣传机器早就公开承认美国真正关心的是这一地区盛产的战略原料如锡、石油、橡胶、铁、砂等，并要各国继续实行损害它们经济的“禁运”，以便美国控制它们的市场。
    以上种种事实，彻底地暴露了曼谷会议的阴谋目的，同东南亚和亚洲各国千百万人民的愿望完全背道而驰，并将对远东和东南亚和平带来新的战争威胁。它已经，并且必将继续激起亚洲人民的坚决反对。
    必须指出，马尼拉条约是美国在得到英国的支持下建立起来的。如果没有英国的支持，美国就不会那么容易地在亚洲肆行侵略，组织侵略性的军事集团，来危害亚洲和平。但是，在许多重要问题上，英国却坚持继续追随美国的侵略政策和战争政策，使英国人民蒙受战争威胁，使亚洲人民更加认清英国仍然极力想维持它对亚洲人民的殖民主义统治。英国的这条道路显然是行不通的。英国人民不能容许这样做，亚洲人民也同样不能容许。事实上，英国企图以追随美国的办法来维持它对亚洲的殖民控制，而美国却正在倚靠英国的支持来在亚洲取代英国的殖民地位。帝国主义的这种矛盾不论他们如何掩饰，都是要发展下去的。
    谁都看得见，美国在亚洲拼凑军事集团准备战争的计划，正在受到东南亚和亚洲人民的声势浩大的坚决反抗。美国及其追随者一切想改变东南亚条约声名狼籍情况的努力，都没有能够成功。东南亚主要国家都拒绝参加东南亚条约。二月二十四日印度
  “自由新闻”说：“印度和这个地区的其他自由国家不愿参加东南亚条约组织式的联盟，理由很简单：它们相信融和的外交和庄严的和平及不干涉的宣言。”“锡兰时报”在评论曼谷会议时也严正表示：“凡是保证不卷入任何一个国家集团的国家都必须继续不和它发生任何关系。”这些都反映了亚洲人民维护和平、反对战争集团的深刻愿望。这种深刻愿望是任何人所不能忽视的，是任何战争活动所不能吓倒的。亚洲人民必将为维护和平、反对战争而坚持斗争到底。
