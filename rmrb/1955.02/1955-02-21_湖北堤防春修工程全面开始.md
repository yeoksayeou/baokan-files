Hubei's Spring Repairs of Dikes and Embankments Commence Fully

    The spring repairs of dikes and embankments in Hubei Province have fully commenced. As of February 4th, over 1.1 million laborers have been deployed to the dikes in various areas.

    Due to the impact of heavy snowstorms, the winter repair project in Hubei Province did not complete its scheduled plan. Therefore, the spring work task is heavier, and the time is very tight. In order to ensure the timely completion of all engineering tasks, all localities have further strengthened their leadership and utilized the Spring Festival period for mobilization and organization work. After the Spring Festival, laborers went to the dikes one after another, and the project progressed rapidly. During the Spring Festival, the Huanggang Special District had 150,000 laborers staying on the construction site to persist in construction. Currently, many counties have completed 70-80% of the total earthwork. The entire district's project is expected to be basically completed ahead of schedule at the end of February.

    湖北堤防春修工程全面开始
    湖北省堤防春修工程已全面开始，到二月四日止，各地上堤民工已达一百一十多万。
    湖北省冬修工程因受大风雪影响，没有完成预订计划。因此春工任务较重，时间又很紧迫。各地为了保证按期完成全部工程任务，都进一步加强了领导力量，并利用春节期间进行了动员组织工作。过了春节，民工便纷纷上堤，工程进展很快。黄冈专区在春节期间并有十五万民工留在工地坚持施工，目前很多县已完成全部工程土方百分之七、八十。全区工程预计可提前在二月底基本完工。
