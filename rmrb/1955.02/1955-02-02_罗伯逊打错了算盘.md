    Robertson Miscalculated
    Gao Ji
    U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Walter Robertson delivered a broadcast speech on January 30, trying desperately to intimidate the Chinese people.
    In his speech, Robertson admitted that the responsibility for eliminating tensions in the Taiwan area lies with the United States. He said, "We can eliminate all tension over Taiwan simply by saying, 'Yes, we are the aggressors, we are wrong. Please come in and take over.'"
    Hearing these words, one might think that Robertson had suddenly become clever. But, of course, this is not the case. Robertson immediately stated that the United States would not accept this solution. According to Robertson, the United States will continue to occupy China's territory of Taiwan, continue to station troops in the Taiwan Strait, and participate in the coastal military activities of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to aggravate tensions in the Taiwan area and expand its aggression against China.
    Not only that, Robertson also openly threatened the Chinese people. According to him, if the Chinese people continue their just struggle to liberate Taiwan, they will "risk war with the United States." If the Chinese people are not afraid of this threat, then they have "miscalculated."
    This is no accident. Some American journalists also issued similar threats to the Chinese people on the same day. United Press reporter Holbrecht, in a dispatch from Taiwan, said that the U.S. war preparations plan in the Taiwan area "also requires bombing the Chinese mainland." Associated Press reporter Randolph, in a dispatch from Tokyo, said that American aircraft in the Far East are already deployed, "ready to strike the Communists once notified." Such shouts from American journalists, who have always followed the dictates of the U.S. aggressive bloc, cannot but be a coordination with Robertson.
    What a show of force by the likes of Robertson! However, the Chinese people are not afraid of this kind of intimidation. The Chinese people have repeatedly stated that if someone insists on imposing war on our heads, we will resolutely strike back at the interventionists and provocateurs. The Chinese people keep their word. The American aggressors should have plenty of experience with this. Robertson should remember the results of the Korean War very clearly. He cannot be unaware of the firm determination of the Chinese people, nor should he fail to see the consequences of the United States launching a war of aggression.
    Robertson may be trying to use this clamor to intimidate other countries, especially those followers of the U.S. aggressive bloc, to get them to help the United States interfere in China's internal affairs. But if he really thinks that the Chinese people, who have stood up, will be intimidated by American threats and clamor, then Robertson, you have miscalculated!

    罗伯逊打错了算盘
    高集
    美国助理国务卿罗伯逊在一月三十日发表广播演说，极力想把中国人民吓倒。
    罗伯逊在他的演说中承认了消除台湾地区的紧张局势的责任在于美国，他说：“我们只要说，‘是的，我们是侵略的，我们错了。请你们进来接管吧’，我们就能消除关于台湾的一切紧张局势。”
    听了这些话，人们会以为罗伯逊忽然变聪明了。可是事实当然并不是这样。罗伯逊紧跟着就表示，美国不会接受这种解决办法。按照罗伯逊的意思，美国还是要继续侵占中国的领土台湾，还是要陈兵台湾海峡，参与蒋介石卖国集团在沿海的军事活动，来加剧台湾地区的紧张局势，扩大对中国的侵略。
    不仅如此，罗伯逊还公然恫吓中国人民。照他的意思，如果中国人民要继续进行解放台湾的正义斗争的话，那就要“冒着同美国作战的危险”，如果中国人民不惧怕这种威胁，就是“打错了算盘”。
    这并不是偶然的，美国的一些记者们在同一天也向中国人民发出了同样的恫吓。合众社记者霍布雷奇特从台湾发出的电讯说，美国在台湾地区的备战计划中，“也需要轰炸中国大陆”；美联社记者伦道夫从东京发出的电讯中说，美国在远东的飞机已经部署就绪，“准备一旦得到通知就打击共产党”。一向奉行美国侵略集团意旨的美国记者们的这种叫嚷，不能不是对罗伯逊的配合。
    罗伯逊之流好一派声势！但是，中国人民是不怕这种恫吓的。中国人民早已一再声明，如果有人硬要把战争强加在我们的头上，我们就一定要对干涉者和挑衅者给以坚决的回击。中国人民说过的话都是算数的。美国侵略者对这一点应该很有经验。朝鲜战争的结果罗伯逊应该还记得很清楚。他不会不知道中国人民的坚定决心，也不应该看不到美国发动侵略战争的下场。
    罗伯逊可能是想用这种叫嚣来恫吓其他国家，特别是那些美国侵略集团的追随者，要它们来帮助美国干涉中国内政。但是，如果他真以为站起来了的中国人民会被美国的威胁和叫嚣所吓倒，那么，罗伯逊，你就是打错了算盘！
