Great Friendship
—— "Pravda" Editorial, February 14

Today is the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. This treaty was signed in Moscow during the visit of the government delegation of the People's Republic of China, headed by Mao Zedong, to the Soviet Union. Peace-loving people of all countries have noted with great satisfaction a fact that is clear to everyone: in recent years, the friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples has become a powerful force for safeguarding and consolidating the cause of peace, something unprecedented in human history.

The congratulatory telegrams exchanged by Comrades K.Y. Voroshilov, N.A. Bulganin, and V.M. Molotov with Comrades Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, and Zhou Enlai on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance demonstrate the great strength and deep enthusiasm generated by this constantly strengthening friendship, and the ever-developing cooperation between the two great peoples.

The strength of Sino-Soviet friendship lies in the fact that it unites two fraternal peoples with a great vitality, numbering eight hundred million. The Soviet Union and China possess inexhaustible material resources. Common goals and a common will unite them, because in the Soviet Union and China, power belongs to the working people, and because the development of both countries is led by the Communist Party.

The friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples has been forged in the long struggle of the two peoples for freedom, democracy, and socialism. The struggle for great social change has increased the enormous creativity of the Soviet and Chinese peoples a hundredfold, uniting them under a common aspiration.

The people of all countries consider the friendship between the Soviet Union and China as a model of a new type of relationship built on complete equality, mutual respect for national interests, mutual assistance, and a sincere desire for common development. Such a relationship is unimaginable in the capitalist camp, where the strong enslave the weak, and where imperialist aggressors trample on the freedom and independence of the peoples they oppress.

The friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples is strengthening year by year under the banner of proletarian internationalism. It exerts an increasingly strong influence on the entire course of human history. It reliably safeguards the peaceful labor of the people of our two fraternal countries, inspired by the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism.

In the autumn of 1954, when the Soviet government delegation headed by Comrades Khrushchev, Bulganin, Mikoyan, and Shvernik visited the People's Republic of China, talks were held on various issues of Sino-Soviet relations and the international situation in an atmosphere of sincere friendship and mutual understanding. Some documents were signed in Beijing, which once again vividly demonstrated the further strengthening of Soviet-Chinese friendship. The ever-consolidating Sino-Soviet friendship and fraternal mutual assistance play a significant role in the economic development and further improvement of the welfare of the people of our two countries.

With the help of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China has newly built and rebuilt one hundred and fifty-six industrial enterprises. Sino-Soviet trade relations are developing on the basis of mutual benefit to both countries. Scientific and technological cooperation has been established in all sectors of the national economies of the Soviet Union and China. The Soviet government has proposed to the People's Republic of China and other People's Democratic countries to provide them with scientific, technological and production assistance in establishing scientific experimental bases for the development of nuclear physics research and the peaceful use of atomic energy. The Government of the People's Republic of China gratefully accepted this proposal.

The constantly developing cultural ties between the Soviet Union and China effectively promote the increasingly close relationship between the two peoples, and their unbreakable friendship is becoming increasingly consolidated. The Soviet people greatly respect the achievements of ancient Chinese culture and respect the masters of modern Chinese culture. The Soviet people study with great interest the achievements of Chinese culture, which have made invaluable contributions to the development of world civilization.

The friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples helps them to victoriously build a new society. After smashing the feudal and colonial shackles, the Chinese working people have demonstrated miracles of labor heroism under the conditions of free life. They are closely united around the Chinese Communist Party and are confidently advancing along the road of socialist construction, along the road of transforming China from an agricultural country into an industrial country. The heroic Chinese people, tempered in struggle, cannot overcome any difficulties under the inspiration and leadership of the Communist Party!

The inexhaustible vitality of the Chinese people has made New China a world power. Today's China is a powerful state of the people's democratic system, and the whole world has witnessed its great strength.

With the support of all People's Democratic countries, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are unswervingly pursuing a policy of easing international tensions. The Chinese people warmly support the Soviet Union's struggle to establish a European collective security system and to oppose the militarization of West Germany. The Soviet Union and China are working to normalize relations with Japan. The Soviet Union and China have consistently built relations with countries in Asia and the Pacific region and with other countries on the basis of strict adherence to the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, which opens up broad prospects for the development of effective international cooperation.

The Geneva Conference particularly clearly demonstrated the great role of the People's Republic of China in resolving international issues, and the true representatives of the Asian people made a powerful voice at the Geneva Conference. The role played by the People's Republic of China at the Geneva Conference once again demonstrated that its influence and international prestige as a great power have been enhanced, and that its peace-loving position has been warmly supported by all freedom-loving people in the world.

But the American aggressive group, which suffered defeat at the Geneva Conference, is not reconciled. They have repeatedly taken aggressive actions against the People's China.

Recently, the United States armed forces have stepped up military provocations in Taiwan and other island areas, an inseparable part of Chinese territory, which they have perfidiously occupied. In this regard, the attitude of the United Nations cannot but be surprising. Until now, it has not condemned the United States' aggressive actions against China, has not demanded that the United States immediately withdraw its armed forces from Taiwan and other Chinese islands it has forcibly occupied, and has not demanded the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China.

The American armed forces' attempt to intimidate the Chinese people with shameless military demonstrations in the Taiwan Strait area is doomed to complete failure. Can the people, who have won freedom in an indomitable long-term armed struggle and inflicted serious defeats on the imperialists, be intimidated? The Chinese people have a strong spirit and a firm will. They are fully aware of their strength, and they will never let anyone undermine their national interests with impunity.

Today, when aggressive groups are trying to intensify international tensions, especially tensions in the Far East, the unbreakable friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and China and their common struggle for peace and security are of paramount importance. This friendship reliably protects the peaceful labor of the people of our two countries, and it is a pillar of world peace and security.

The Soviet Union's position on the Taiwan issue is very clear and well known to everyone. The Soviet Union believes that the Taiwan issue is China's internal affair, and that the United States' predatory actions and threats of war are acts of aggression. The Soviet government has submitted the issue of American aggression against the People's Republic of China to the Security Council for discussion. Recently, the Soviet government proposed convening a conference of countries particularly concerned with resolving the situation created in the Taiwan area.

The policy of the People's Republic of China of defending its sovereignty, opposing aggressors, and safeguarding national dignity has won the sympathy of the Soviet people and all progressive mankind. In the sacred cause of defending their motherland, the Chinese people can count on the help of their faithful friend - the great Soviet people.

The Soviet people deeply respect and love the great, hardworking, and talented Chinese people. The great goal of building a new socialist life unites the people of the Soviet Union and China, and their fraternal friendship is unbreakable.

On this fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet people celebrate the further strengthening of our great friendship with joy. The Soviet people wish their faithful friends and brothers, the Chinese people, new achievements in building and consolidating the new, people's democratic state.

May the friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and China, a reliable bastion of peace and international security, be further consolidated and developed!

    伟大的友谊
    ——“真理报”二月十四日社论
    今天是苏中友好同盟互助条约签订五周年纪念日。这一条约是以毛泽东为首的中华人民共和国政府代表团访问苏联时在莫斯科签订的。爱好自由的各国人民都怀着十分满意的心情注意到一个人人都很清楚的事实：这些年来，苏联人民同中国人民的友谊已经成了维护和巩固和平事业的强大力量，这是人类历史上从来未曾有过的。
    克·叶·伏罗希洛夫同志，尼·亚·布尔加宁同志、维·米·莫洛托夫同志同毛泽东同志、刘少奇同志、周恩来同志在苏中友好同盟互助条约签订五周年之际互致的贺电，证明了这种不断加强的友谊所产生的伟大的力量和深厚的热情，证明了伟大的两国人民之间的不断发展着的合作。
    苏中友谊的力量在于：这种友谊团结了有着伟大的生命力的、共有八亿人口的两国兄弟人民。苏联和中国拥有无穷无尽的物质资源。共同的目标、共同的意志把它们结合在一起，因为在苏联和中国，政权都是属于劳动人民的，因为两国的发展都是由共产党领导的。
    苏联人民同中国人民的友谊是在两国人民争取自由、民主和社会主义的长期斗争过程中锻炼出来的。为伟大的社会变革而进行的斗争，百倍地提高了苏中两国人民的巨大的创造力，使他们团结在一致的愿望之下。
    世界各国人民认为苏联和中国的友谊是建筑在完全平等、互相尊重民族利益、互相帮助和争取共同发展的真诚愿望上的新型关系的典范。在资本主义阵营中这种关系是不可想像的。在那里强者奴役弱者，在那里帝国主义侵略者蹂躏受他们压迫的各国人民的自由和独立。
    苏中两国人民的友谊在无产阶级国际主义的旗帜的照耀下一年比一年加强。它对人类历史发展的整个进程发生着日益强烈的影响。它牢靠地保卫着在伟大的马克思列宁主义思想鼓舞下的我们两个兄弟国家人民的和平劳动。
    一九五四年秋天，当以赫鲁晓夫、布尔加宁、米高扬、什维尔尼克等同志为首的苏联政府代表团访问中华人民共和国的时候，在真诚友好、互相谅解的气氛中就苏中关系和国际形势的各项问题举行了会谈。在北京签署了一些文件，这些文件又一次鲜明地证明了苏联和中国友谊的进一步加强。日益巩固的苏中友谊和兄弟互助，在我们两国人民的经济的发展和福利的进一步提高方面起着显著的作用。
    中华人民共和国在苏联的帮助下新建和改建一百五十六项工业企业。苏中的贸易关系在两国互利的条件下发展着。苏联和中国的国民经济的一切部门都建立起了科学技术合作。苏联政府已向中华人民共和国以及其他一些人民民主国家建议，在建立为发展核子物理学的研究和和平使用原子能的科学实验基地方面给它们科学技术和生产上的帮助。中华人民共和国政府怀着感激的心情接受了这个建议。
    苏中两国不断发展的文化联系有效地促进这两国人民关系日益亲密，他们之间的牢不可破的友谊日益巩固。苏联人民极其尊重中国古代文化的成就，尊重中国现代的文化大师。苏联人以极大的兴趣研究对于世界文明的发展作出过无可估价的贡献的中国文化的成就。
    苏中两国人民的友谊帮助他们胜利地建设新社会。中国劳动人民在粉碎了封建和殖民枷锁之后，在自由生活的条件下表现了劳动英雄主义的奇迹。他们紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，满怀信心地沿着社会主义建设的道路前进，沿着把中国由农业国变成工业国的道路前进。在斗争中经过千锤百炼的英勇的中国人民，在共产党的鼓舞和领导下，是没有任何困难克服不了的！
    中国人民的无穷无尽的生命力使新中国成为一个世界大国。现在的中国是一个强大的人民民主制度的国家，全世界都亲眼看到它的伟大的力量。
    苏联和中华人民共和国在所有人民民主国家的支持下，坚持不渝地奉行缓和国际紧张局势的方针。中国人民热烈支持苏联争取建立欧洲集体安全体系、反对西德军国主义化的斗争。苏联和中国在努力谋求对日关系的正常化。苏联和中国一贯把同亚洲和太平洋区域的国家以及同其他国家的关系，建筑在严格遵守互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处等原则的基础上，这就为发展有成效的国际合作打开了广阔的前途。
    日内瓦会议特别明显地证明了中华人民共和国在解决国际问题上的巨大作用，亚洲人民的真正的代表在日内瓦会议上发出了有力的呼声。中华人民共和国在日内瓦会议上所起的作用，再一次证明了它作为一个大国的影响和国际威望提高了，证明了它的爱好和平的立场得到全世界所有爱好自由的人民的热烈支持。
    但是在日内瓦会议上遭到失败的美国侵略集团并不甘心。他们一次又一次地对人民中国采取侵略行动。
    最近美国武装部队在被他们背信弃义地占据的、属于中国领土不可分割的一部分的台湾和其他岛屿地区，加紧进行军事挑衅。在这方面，联合国的态度不能不令人感到惊讶，直到现在它还没有谴责美国对中国的侵略行动，没有要求美国把它的武装部队立即从台湾和被它强占的中国其他岛屿撤走，也没有要求恢复中华人民共和国的合法权利。
    美国武装力量妄想在台湾海峡地区用无耻的军事示威来恐吓中国人民，这注定是要完全失败的。曾经在不屈不挠的长期的武装斗争中取得了自由并且使帝国主义者遭到严重失败的人民，难道是可以吓倒的吗？中国人民有着坚强的精神和坚定的意志，他们充分意识到自己的力量，他们永远不会让任何人不受惩罚地破坏他们的民族利益。
    今天，当侵略集团力图加剧国际紧张局势、特别是远东紧张局势的时候，苏中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊和他们争取和平和安全的共同斗争就具有头等意义。这种友谊可靠地保护着我们两国人民的和平劳动，它是世界和平和安全的支柱。
    苏联在台湾问题上的立场是十分明确的，是大家都知道得很清楚的。苏联认为：台湾问题是中国的内政，美国的掠夺行动和战争威胁是侵略行为。苏联政府曾经将美国对中华人民共和国的侵略问题提交安全理事会讨论。最近，苏联政府建议召开对解决在台湾地区造成的局势特别关心的国家的会议。
    中华人民共和国政府捍卫自己的主权、反对侵略者、维护民族尊严的政策，得到苏联人民和全体进步人类的同情。中国人民在保卫祖国的神圣事业中能够指靠他们忠实的朋友——伟大的苏联人民的帮助。
    苏联人民深深地尊重和热爱伟大的、勤劳的和天才的中国人民，建设新的、社会主义生活这一伟大的目的把苏中两国人民团结在一起，他们的兄弟般的友谊是牢不可破的。
    在这苏中条约签订五周年的日子里，苏联人民怀着满腔欢乐的心情，庆祝我们伟大的友谊的进一步加强。苏联人民祝自己的忠实的朋友和弟兄——中国人民在建设和巩固新的、人民民主制度的国家中取得新的成就。
    祝苏中两国的友谊和合作——和平和国际安全的可靠堡垒日益巩固和发展！
