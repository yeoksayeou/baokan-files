Before liberation, the production capacity of the Shenyang Transformer Factory was very weak. The maximum capacity of the transformers produced was only 500 kVA, and the highest voltage was 6,600 volts.

After liberation, the production of the Shenyang Transformer Factory developed rapidly, and the technology also improved rapidly. In 1952, with the help of Soviet experts, the factory produced 560 to 5,000 kVA transformers for the first time. In 1953, it began to manufacture 10,000 and 13,500 kVA transformers. In 1954, it manufactured 20,000 kVA transformers. This year, it has started preparing to manufacture transformers with larger capacity and higher voltage.

This achievement is significant. However, some comrades in the factory are satisfied with this. They only report good news and not bad news to the higher authorities, and they cannot fully carry out criticism and self-criticism internally. Many shortcomings and errors are covered up. One of the problems that has been exposed today is the repeated occurrence of product quality accidents.

	Repeated product quality accidents occur, but the root cause is never sought

The transformers produced by the factory, whether large, medium, or small, have all experienced quality accidents one after another.

In 1953, a serious quality accident occurred in the production of small transformers. The main reason was that the administrative and technical leadership departments of the factory did not adopt the Soviet method of individually immersing wire coils in paint, but adopted an outdated method. This accident exposed the factory's serious shortcomings in learning from the Soviet Union.

After the accident, the magazine "Electrical Industry" of the Electrical Industry Administration published three articles. The first article was written by the chief engineer of the factory, and the second article was a short commentary. Both articles regarded the quality accident of small transformers as merely a problem of workshop operation, and did not treat it as a problem of leadership ideology to be examined. The same issue of the magazine contained the opinions of Soviet experts on the quality accident of small transformers. He clearly stated: "The main reason for this accident lies in the technical leadership, which did not closely grasp the technical improvement work of the small transformer workshop." "Engineers and administrative personnel in the factory still lack sufficient sense of responsibility for the cause entrusted by the state. ..." Unfortunately, the Electrical Industry Administration and the factory did not learn a lesson from this accident. As a result, quality accidents continued to occur later.

Of the four large transformers that have been shipped out of the factory, two have had problems so far. When one of them was transported to the site for installation, it was found that there was a sound of falling objects in the oil tank. It was transported back for disassembly and repair, which took nearly a year, affecting the power supply in the power consumption area and causing great losses.

How did the leadership view such a major accident? In the 21st issue of the "Mechanical Industry" magazine of the First Ministry of Machine Building in 1954, an article entitled "Losses Caused by a Dirty Oily Glove" was published. The author lightly blamed the responsibility on a dirty oily glove found in the transformer. This view is consistent with the views of some leading comrades in the factory.

Of course, it is serious and intolerable to have a dirty oily glove in the transformer. But this glove is not the direct cause of the transformer's return for repair. The author obviously overlooked the fact that the factory did not follow the key process codes required by the Soviet design when manufacturing large transformers. Why is this? Blame the workshop and blame the workers for poor operation? But why not first provide the workers with the Soviet manufacturing methods?

Some leaders of the factory simply regarded learning from the Soviet Union as "using Soviet drawings," completely ignoring the process data that is inseparable from the drawings in the Soviet materials. The technical leadership department did not use Soviet process data and produced a lot of process regulations by itself. Most of the content was neither specific nor advanced, only stipulating what the workers "should do," but not stipulating "how to do it" and "what tools to use." When the returned large transformer was disassembled, it turned out that 20% of the core nuts on the transformer were loose. The workers' operation was problematic, but the factory's operational requirements for the assembly of large cores only required the workers to "tighten the screws" without telling the workers, as stipulated in the Soviet operating procedures: "Use spot riveting to rivet the screw caps firmly," "Rivet all screw caps at three points." In 1954, the process department began to pay attention to learning Soviet process documents, and then discovered that the Soviet materials had detailed instructions for every small operation, with explanatory diagrams attached to important places. After the factory organized workers to study, everyone felt very satisfied and was willing to resolutely implement them. This is enough to show that if it is possible to act in accordance with the Soviet practices, and at the same time mobilize employees to ensure compliance with operating procedures and strictly enforce production discipline, such a major accident will definitely not occur.

However, the factory's review to the Electrical Industry Administration did not address such a question at all: Why did the factory have Soviet materials in 1952, but it did not organize employees to produce in accordance with Soviet process regulations at all during the 1953 production? These reviews were submitted to the Electrical Industry Administration, and to this day, the Electrical Industry Administration has not raised a single question.

Because lessons were not seriously learned, a quality accident occurred again in the 20,000 kVA transformer due to the wrong cable used for the tap switch. In September 1954, a worker discovered that the high-voltage lead cable of the tap switch was too thin during the manufacturing process of the 20,000 kVA transformer. After checking the drawings and Soviet materials, it was found that the specifications required by the original materials were half as small. Then, it was found that the high-voltage lead cables of the large transformers produced from 1953 to September 1954 were not of Soviet specifications. Transformers manufactured with this cable are unsafe to use and cannot withstand the test when the power load is concentrated. However, the factory's inspection only turned it into an accidental "misuse of cable." In fact, this is another warning that the factory did not study the Soviet Union well.

In addition to the quality accidents of transformers, there were also accidents of welding machines and pipe bending machines. In the factory warehouse, there are now hundreds of welding machines that no one wants. These welding machines were also caused by the factory's technical leaders not studying Soviet materials, not paying attention to trial production, and hastily finalizing the design. There are many other quality accidents, which do not need to be listed one by one. The serious problem is that these serious phenomena have not been able to touch the hearts of some leading comrades. In their view, it seems that these are just "small things" that have nothing to do with them.

The losses and waste caused by all these accidents are staggering. In addition to wasting a lot of state funds and man-hours, the most important thing is that the use of these transformers with poor quality will affect the entire production, reduce equipment utilization, and shorten the service life. This intangible loss is immeasurable.

	The factory director is directly responsible for product quality accidents, and the Party committee has abandoned ideological leadership

Comrade Ren Junjie, the factory director, adopted an irresponsible bureaucratic attitude towards the repeated occurrence of product quality accidents. As a factory director, he has the responsibility to investigate these product quality accidents clearly, formulate measures, submit them to the factory Party committee for discussion, make correct decisions under the collective leadership of the Party, and take a series of steps to eliminate the accidents. Comrade Ren Junjie did not do this. He took another approach, which is: before the accident is exposed, try to cover up the error as much as possible, do not listen to the opinions of employees, and therefore cannot discover problems and eliminate errors in the design and production process in a timely manner. After the accident is exposed, instead of actively relying on the working class under the collective leadership of the Party to find out the root cause of the error, investigate the responsibility, draw correct conclusions, and learn lessons, and make specific measures to prevent accidents, he avoids contacting the essence of the problem in every possible way, and is unwilling to look for the root cause of the accident from the leading ideology, but only pushes the responsibility to objective reasons and to workshop cadres and workers.

Many comrades in the transformer factory have long been dissatisfied with this phenomenon. They put forward many valuable opinions long ago, but Comrade Ren Junjie did not pay attention to these opinions. Although he regarded "maintaining good relations with the Party committee" as an "experience," he actually ignored the leading role of the factory Party organization in the enterprise. On the other hand, he used the excuse of "not understanding technology" to give up leading technical personnel.

Comrade Ren Junjie should have learned a lesson from the first product accident, but he did not. Then the second, third... quality accident occurred. When we compare the causes of these accidents, we find that they are basically the same, that is, production is not carried out by relying on the working class to comprehensively learn from the Soviet Union. Why has this problem not been solved for a long time? There are difficulties, but these difficulties can be overcome. However, in the face of this problem, can the enterprise leaders shirk their responsibilities?

There are different views on product quality accidents within the factory Party committee. Some Party committee members once had some correct views. However, the Party committee members did not correctly resolve the differences through ideological struggle within the Party. Many comrades abandoned the weapon of ideological struggle under the guise of "being afraid of making trouble and being afraid of hindering unity." The result is that the leading role of the Party is weakened, and the capitalist ideology and style have also followed.

	The Electrical Industry Administration of the First Ministry of Machine Building did not soberly check the work of the factory, but instead encouraged their exaggerated style

The Shenyang Transformer Factory is a first-class factory under the leadership of the Electrical Industry Administration of the First Ministry of Machine Building. From 1952 to 1954, it has long been a pilot factory of the Administration. The director, office director, and section chiefs of the Bureau often stationed in the factory to help with work and summarized many experiences, which were repeatedly praised in public and internal publications and circulars. However, they never fundamentally analyzed and studied the actual situation of the factory's repeated quality accidents. When problems occurred, they only asked the factory to write a review, but did not carefully study whether these reviews truly reflected the actual situation? Are these measures really able to prevent errors from happening again? The leaders of the Administration were intoxicated with the good news of the successful trial production and formal production of 10,000 and 20,000 kVA transformers. They forgot their most important responsibility to check with a sober mind how these tasks were carried out and what the actual results were. It was clear that there were serious shortcomings in the trial production of new products, but they still had to publish these experiences as the most important articles in the journal every year to promote them.

In February 1953, the "Electrical Industry" published a summary of the trial production work of new products in the transformer factory in 1952. What we see from this summary is: "The trial production of three-phase 5,000 kVA, 44 kV power transformers has been completed. The performance standards such as insulation strength are completely implemented in accordance with Soviet test standards, and the results are quite satisfactory." "In terms of medium-sized transformers... the needs of newly built factories and mines have been met... and the Soviet standard requirements have been met." Is it so "satisfactory" and "meets Soviet standards"? Later, the results of product use proved that this was not the case. In February 1954, the "Technical Experience Exchange" published by the Technical Department of the First Ministry of Machine Building published a preliminary summary of the trial production of new products in the Shenyang Transformer Factory in 1953. In the editor's note, it was pointed out that: "The Shenyang Transformer Factory has achieved certain trial production results among the electrical factories. The reason is that they have mastered certain rules, persisted from top to bottom, and integrated, so they have been rapidly improved." However, none of these rules mentioned seriously checking and summarizing the experience of learning from the Soviet Union. On the contrary, they put forward some questionable "rules." For example, the first one is "Leaders at all levels attach great importance to it. If there are difficulties in trial production at the end of the month, cadres at the factory level routinely go to the workshop for inspection." Doesn't this precisely show that the factory's trial production of new products lacks the necessary preparation work, resulting in difficulties at the end of the month, so that cadres at the factory level have to "routinely go to the workshop for inspection"? Some practices have been promoted as experience, such as "trial production professional group," "preparing process cards during the trial production period" and "detailed tables by workshop, detailed tables of materials," but these practices in the factory are either divorced from reality or simply not done, and are also promoted as experience. Now let's look at the summary of 1954. This is an article published in the name of Shenyang Transformer Factory on the "Experience Introduction" publication of the Electrical Industry Administration on September 10, 1954, entitled "A Few Experiences in Developing and Expanding Product Variety." These experiences are all specious. For example, the first one is to comprehensively learn from the Soviet Union, which is undoubtedly correct, and it is more progressive than the previous summary, but the content is not right. For example, it says: "Our factory attaches more importance to the current Soviet materials." "In addition to Soviet drawings, we also collect and sort out some basic technical data from general Soviet technical materials, such as Soviet national standards, material standards, and Soviet books and magazines related to transformers, and compile them into product design manuals for designers to use." In fact, this product design manual is not entirely Soviet standards. It contains a lot of backward and conservative data. Now, this manual is being reorganized. In addition, each of the articles mentioned in the article does not correspond to the facts to varying degrees. For example, in the article "Attaching Importance to Ideological Leadership of Technical Personnel," it is mentioned that "encouraging technical personnel to read ideological documents," which is made out of nothing. "Listening to expert reports and organizing technical personnel to visit the factory" was only done once. The fifth article, "Organizing a National Unified Product Design," proposes "promoting the advanced technical standards of the Soviet Union." "This not only enables the Soviet standards to be promoted to all-round manufacturing departments and user departments, but also solves the difficulties of lack of drawings in various places, and the product design of each factory has a solid foundation." In reality, it is not as beautiful as the text writes. These unified design drawings did not fully adopt the advanced technical standards of the Soviet Union. In many places, people used conservative and backward methods to modify the Soviet design, causing many bad consequences in subsequent production. The last article is "Establishing a Professional Trial Production Group," and this organization was abolished as soon as it was established. The Electrical Industry Administration has been spreading these "experiences" year after year, but why not find out about the actual situation? Why can't we discover some of the exaggerated and complacent emotions in the factory's leading ideology from these reports? Why can't we seize the fundamental issue of learning from the Soviet Union and conduct a serious inspection? This is inseparable from the one-sidedness of their own leading ideology and the exaggerated, complacent, and unthorough leading style.

We hope that the Electrical Industry Administration will seriously check the leadership of the factory, carry out ideological transformation work in the technical departments, start with strengthening ideological leadership to establish a solid ideology of learning from the Soviet Union, criticize capitalist ideology, and this will definitely further improve the ideological and technical level of the factory's employees and lay a solid foundation for completing the 1955 production tasks.

    沈阳变压器厂为什么一再发生产品质量事故
    本报记者　安岗
    沈阳变压器厂解放以前生产能力十分薄弱，生产的变压器每台容量最大不过五百千伏安，电压最高是六千六百伏。
    解放以后，沈阳变压器厂的生产发展很快，技术也迅速地提高了。一九五二年在苏联专家帮助下第一次生产了五百六十到五千千伏安的变压器；一九五三年开始制造一万、一万三千五百千伏安的变压器，一九五四年制造了两万千伏安的变压器，今年已着手准备制造容量更大、电压更高的变压器。
    这一成就是很大的。但工厂有些同志却以此为满足，对上是报喜不报忧，在内部不能充分地展开批评和自我批评，很多缺点和错误被掩盖起来，到今天已经暴露出来的问题之一就是连续发生的产品质量事故。
      一再发生产品质量事故，但从来没有从根本上寻找原因
    工厂生产的变压器无论是大、中、小型都先后发生了质量事故。
    一九五三年，小变压器生产中发生严重的质量事故。主要原因是工厂行政和技术领导部门没有采用苏联的线卷单独浸漆的方法，而采用了落后的方法。这个事故暴露了工厂在学习苏联方面有着严重缺点。
    事故发生后，电器工业管理局的刊物“电器工业”上发了三篇文章，第一篇是工厂主任工程师写的，第二篇是个短评，这两篇文章都把小变压器质量事故，仅仅看作是车间操作的问题，而没有把它当作一个领导思想问题来进行检查。同期刊物中载有苏联专家对小变压器质量事故的意见，他明确提出：“这次事故，主要原因在技术领导方面，没有抓紧小变压器车间的技术改进工作”，“厂内工程师和行政管理人员对国家所委托的事业还缺乏足够的责任感。……”可惜的是，电器工业管理局和工厂没有从这一事故中接受教训。因而，以后质量事故连续发生。
    已经出厂的四台大型变压器中，到现在，已有两台发生问题，其中一台运到现场安装时，发现油箱内有落物声，运回拆修，前后费了将近一年时间，影响用电地区的供电，造成极大损失。
    领导方面对于这样一个重大的事故是怎样看法呢？一九五四年第一机械工业部机关刊物“机械工业”第二十一期发表了一篇题目叫作“一只油污手套造成的损失”的文章，作者轻描淡写的，把责任归罪于在变压器内发现的一只油污的手套。这个看法同工厂某些领导同志的看法是一致的。
    在变压器内竟夹有一只油污的手套，这当然是严重的和不可容忍的。但这只手套还不是造成变压器返修的直接原因，作者显然忽略了这样一个事实：工厂制造大变压器没有按照苏联设计要求的关键工艺守则办事。为什么会这样呢？把责任推给车间，责备工人操作不好吗？可是为什么不首先供给工人以苏联的工艺制造方法呢？
    工厂某些领导者把学习苏联只单纯看作是“使用苏联图纸”，完全忽视了在苏联资料中同图纸不可分的工艺资料。技术领导部门不用苏联工艺资料，自己制作了不少的工艺规程，内容大部分是既不具体，又不先进，只规定要工人“干什么”，而没有规定“怎样干”“用什么工具来干”。那台返修的大变压器，拆开一看，原来是变压器上的铁心螺帽有百分之二十松动。工人操作是有问题的，但工厂规定的大型铁心装配的操作要求却只是要工人“扭紧螺丝”而没有像苏联操作规程规定的要告诉工人：“用点铆法，把螺丝帽铆牢”，“所有螺丝帽铆统三点”，一九五四年工艺科开始重视学习苏联工艺文件，这才发现苏联资料对每一个小操作都有详细说明，重要地方还附有说明图。工厂组织工人学习后，大家感到非常满意，愿意坚决执行。这足以说明，如果能够按照苏联的作法行事，同时发动职工保证遵守操作规程，严格生产纪律，就一定不会产生这样大的事故。
    可是工厂给电器工业管理局的检讨却根本没有接触到这样一个问题：为什么工厂在一九五二年就有了苏联资料，而一九五三年制作时却完全没有按照苏联的工艺规程组织职工进行生产。这些检讨提交给电器工业管理局，到今天，电器工业管理局也没有提出过一个问题。
    由于没有认真接受教训，两万千伏安变压器又发生了分接开关用错电缆线的质量事故。一九五四年九月，一个工人在制造两万千伏安变压器过程中发现分接开关高压引线电缆太细，提出怀疑，查对图纸及苏联资料，发现与原资料要求的规格小一倍，接着查出从一九五三年到一九五四年九月所生产的大变压器高压引线电缆都不是苏联规格。用这种电缆制造的变压器，在使用上是不安全的，它经不起电力负荷量集中时的考验。可是，工厂的检查只是把它变成偶然“错用电缆”了。事实上，这又是对工厂没有很好学习苏联的一个警告。
    除了变压器的质量事故外，还有电焊机和卷管机事故，在工厂仓库里，现在堆了几百台没有人要的电焊机。这些电焊机也是因为工厂技术领导干部不学习苏联资料，不重视试制工作，草率定型而造成损失的。其他质量事故还有很多，不必一一列举，问题严重的是，这些严重现象，并没有能够打动某些领导同志的心，在他们看来，好像这不过是一些与己无关的“小事”。
    所有这些事故造成的损失和浪费是惊人的。除浪费国家大量资金和工时外，最重要的是这些质量不好的变压器投入生产将会影响整个生产，减低设备运用率，缩短使用年限，这种无形的损失是不可估量的。
    工厂厂长对产品质量事故负有直接责任，党委会放弃了思想领导
    工厂厂长任俊杰同志对于一再发生的产品质量事故采取了不负责任的官僚主义态度。作为一个工厂厂长，他有责任把这些产品质量事故调查清楚，订出措施，提交工厂党委会讨论，在党的集体领导下作出正确的决议，并采取一系列步骤来消灭事故。任俊杰同志没有这样作，他采取了另外一种办法，这就是：在事故没有被揭发出来前，尽量掩盖错误，不去倾听职工的意见，因而也就不能在设计和生产过程中及时发现问题，消灭错误。在事故被揭露后，他不是主动积极地在党的集体领导下依靠工人阶级去找出发生错误的根本原因，查明责任，作出正确的结论，并接受教训，作出防止事故的具体措施。反而多方回避接触问题的本质，不愿意从领导思想中去寻找产生事故的根本原因，只是把责任推给客观原因，推给车间干部和工人。
    变压器厂职工中有不少同志长期对于这种现象是不满意的，他们很早以前就提出过不少宝贵的意见，但任俊杰同志并没有重视这些意见。他虽然把
  “同党委搞好关系”当作一条“经验”，但实际上却是漠视工厂党组织在企业中的领导作用。另一方面，他又以“不懂技术”为借口，放弃对技术工作人员的领导。
    任俊杰同志本来应该从第一次产品事故中接受教训，他没有这样作。接着就发生了第二次，第三次……质量事故。我们把这些事故产生的原因加以比较，就发现了它基本上是一个东西，这就是没有依靠工人阶级全面学习苏联来进行生产。为什么长时期这个问题得不到解决呢？困难是有的，但这些困难都是可以克服的。可是，在这个问题面前，企业领导者能够推脱自己应负的责任吗？
    工厂党委会内部对于产品质量事故是有着不同看法的，有些党委委员曾有着一些正确的看法。但是党委委员并没有通过党内思想斗争来正确解决分歧。很多同志在“怕闹关系、怕妨害团结”的口实下放弃了思想斗争的武器。结果就是削弱了党的领导作用，而资本主义的思想和作风也就随之发作起来。
    第一机械工业部电器工业管理局没有清醒地检查工厂工作，反而助长了他们的虚夸作风
    沈阳变压器工厂是第一机械工业部电器工业管理局领导下的被评为一等的工厂。从一九五二年到一九五四年三年中，长期是管理局的试点工厂。局长、办公室主任，科长经常不断地驻厂帮助工作，总结了很多条经验，在公开的和内部的刊物上以及通报上一再表扬，可是，他们对于工厂一再发生的质量事故却从来没有从根本上分析研究一下实际情况。等到发生了问题，他们只是叫工厂写检讨了事，而不去仔细研究一下，这些检讨是不是真实地反映了实际情况？这些措施是不是真正可以防止错误再次发生？管理局的领导者陶醉在一万、二万千伏安的变压器试制成功和正式生产的捷报中。他们忘掉了自己的、最重要的责任是以清醒的头脑来检查这些工作是怎样执行的，以及实际的效果如何。明明是新产品试制中有着严重的缺点，可是他们却是年年要把这些经验当作头等重要的文章登在刊物上来推广。
    一九五三年二月在“电器工业”上发表了变压器工厂一九五二年新产品试制工作总结摘要。我们从这篇总结中看到的是：“三相五千千伏安、四十四千伏电力变压器试制完成，性能标准如绝缘强度等完全依苏联试验标准执行，结果相当使人满意。”“在中型变压器方面……满足了新建厂矿的需要……符合了苏联标准要求”。是不是这样“令人满意”“符合苏联标准”呢？后来产品使用结果证明并不如此。一九五四年二月，第一机械工业部技术司出版的“技术经验交流”上发表了沈阳变压器厂一九五三年新产品试制工作初步总结，在编者按语中指出：“沈阳变压器厂在电器各厂中取得了一定的试制成绩，原因是他们掌握到若干规律，由上自下，一体坚持，因而迅速地得到改进。”可是，这些规律中没有一处谈到认真检查和总结学习苏联的经验，相反地他们提出了一些值得怀疑的“规律”，例如第一条是“各级领导很重视，到了月底，如果试制有困难，厂一级干部照例下车间检查”。这不正是说明，工厂试制新产品缺乏应有的准备工作，结果造成月底困难，以致厂一级干部不得不“照例下车间检查”吗？有些作法是作为经验推广了，如“试制专业小组”，
  “在试制期间，编制工艺过程卡片”及“分车间明细表、材料明细表”，可是这些作法在工厂有的是脱离实际，有的根本没有作，也被当作经验推广了。现在我们再看一九五四年的总结，这是一九五四年九月十日在电器工业管理局“经验介绍”刊物上的用沈阳变压器厂名义发表的一篇文章题目叫作：“我们发展和扩大产品品种的几点体会”，这些体会都是似是而非的，例如，第一条是全面学习苏联，这无疑是对的，而且比过去的总结提法有了进步，但内容就不对头了，如说：“我厂对于现在苏联资料比较重视”“除苏联图纸外，我们对于一般性的苏联技术资料，如苏联国家标准、材料标准、苏联出版有关变压器的书籍杂志都多方收集、整理出一些基本技术数据，编成产品设计手册，供设计人员使用”，实际上，这本产品设计手册，并不全是苏联标准，其中掺杂了不少落后的，保守的数据，现在，这个手册正重新整理中。此外，该文所提的每一条都同事实或多或少地不相符合，如在“重视对技术人员思想领导”这一条中，提到“鼓励技术人员看有思想性的文件”，这是无中生有，“听专家报告及组织技术人员参观工厂”，只是作了一次。第五条“组织全国性的产品统一设计”下提出“推广了苏联的先进技术标准”，“这样不但使苏联标准得以推广到全面范围的制造部门和使用部门，而且也解决了各处图纸缺乏的困难，各厂的产品设计也因此有了巩固的基础”。实际并没有文字写得这么美妙。这些统一设计的图纸没有完全采用苏联的先进的技术标准，其中有很多地方，被人用保守落后的方法修改了苏联设计，造成以后生产上许多恶果。最后一条是“成立专业试制组”，这个组织一成立就取消了。电器工业管理局一年一年只是在那里传播这些“经验”，可是，为什么不去了解一下实际情况呢？为什么不能从这些报告中发现工厂领导思想中的一些虚夸自满的情绪呢？为什么不能抓住学习苏联这个根本问题认真作一次检查呢？这同他们自己领导思想的片面性和领导作风的虚夸、自满、不深入是分不开的。
    我们希望电器工业管理局认真检查工厂的领导，在技术部门中进行思想改造工作，从加强思想领导入手来建立牢固的学习苏联的思想，批判资本主义的思想，这样就一定会进一步提高工厂职工的思想水平和技术水平，给完成一九五五年生产任务打下有力的基础。
