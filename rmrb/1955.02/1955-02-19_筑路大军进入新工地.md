The construction army building the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has entered the new construction site in batches. Since entering winter construction in November last year, the temperature along the nearly 100-kilometer construction line of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway has often dropped to minus 28 degrees Celsius, and the ground has frozen to a depth of one meter. In order to support the liberation of Taiwan, the workers came up with many ways to overcome difficulties. In the construction of bridges and culverts, in addition to using warm sheds and warm bottles for construction, they also used rubble to make the foundation of the culvert pipes. Bottom blasting was promoted for mountain opening projects. In the rubble masonry project, the workers created a rolling shutter-style grouting method. The finished product factory shortened the insulation time of concrete steam curing based on advanced Soviet experience, increasing efficiency by a quarter. As a result of promoting these advanced experiences, the quality of various winter construction projects was good and the construction period was shortened. By the end of January, the bridge, culvert, roadbed, and earthwork projects from Qingshanpu to Hexipu were basically completed. The earthwork project from Pingkouxia to Gaoling has also been basically completed. Next, the earth and stone excavation team marched westward to the Xiaoqingkou section to start mechanized construction. More than 2,000 workers in the Fourth Engineering Section have started some earth and stone excavation projects on the grassland construction site in the Gaoling to Shandan section.

Westward from Jiuba is a Gobi desert and grassland. The Ministry of Railways has equipped the workers with wind mirrors, leather hats, cotton-padded coats and other wind-proof and cold-proof supplies and sufficient drinking water, all of which are ready. On January 28, the track laying team started to continue laying tracks westward from Jiuba. On the first day, 2.1 kilometers of track were laid, exceeding the first day's track laying plan by 5 percent.

    筑路大军进入新工地
    修筑兰新铁路的筑路大军已分批进入新工地。自去年十一月进入冬季施工以来，兰新铁路近百公里施工沿线，气温常降低到零下二十八度，地层冻结一公尺厚。职工们为了支援解放台湾，想出了许多战胜困难的办法，修桥涵时除采用了暖棚和暖瓶法施工外，并利用片石做涵管基础。开山工程推广了底部爆炸。在浆砌片石工程中，工人们创造了卷帘式灌浆法，成品厂根据苏联先进经验缩短了混凝土蒸汽养生的保温时间，提高工率四分之一。推广这些先进经验的结果，使冬季施工各项工程质量良好，并缩短了工期，到元月下旬，青山堡至河西堡的桥涵路基土方工程已基本竣工。平口峡至高岭一段土方工程也已基本结束。接着，土石方工程队又向西挺进到小青口一段展开了机械化施工，第四工程段两千多名职工，在高岭至山丹段的草滩工地，已有部分土石方工程开工。
    从九坝往西，是一片戈壁滩和草滩，铁道部给工人们配备的风镜、皮帽、棉大衣等防风御寒用品和充足的饮水，都已准备齐全。元月二十八日钉道工程队已由九坝开始继续向西铺轨。第一日铺轨二点一公里，已超额完成第一天铺轨计划百分之五。
