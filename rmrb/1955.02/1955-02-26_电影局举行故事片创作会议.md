Xinhua News Agency report

    The Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture recently held a feature film creation meeting to review the films produced in 1954 and to discuss how to produce more and better feature films. More than 150 people, including film scriptwriters, directors, and actors, participated in the meeting.
    During the meeting, the film artists repeatedly watched more than a dozen feature films they created last year, and conducted comprehensive and separate studies on the screenwriting, directing, acting, and other aspects of these films. They also listened to reports on the guiding principles and tasks of China's cultural work in 1955, the Second All-Union Congress of Soviet Writers, the Soviet film industry, and the creation of characters in Soviet films.
    More than 30 film scriptwriters, directors, and actors spoke at the meeting about their own creative experiences and other issues. The meeting pointed out that in the process of studying socialist realism, the production of feature films in our country made significant progress last year, and films such as "Reconnaissance Across the River" that were loved by the masses were produced; however, it still lags far behind the needs of the people, and many sharp struggles in the great socialist construction of the motherland have not been reflected, the life conflicts revealed in the films are not very profound, and the images of positive characters are not real and vivid enough.
    The meeting clearly pointed out that the themes of feature films must be further expanded in the future, and at the same time, film artists must attach importance to the characteristics of art on the basis of mastering Marxism-Leninism and in-depth study of life, and reveal the complex contradictions and conflicts in life through the creation of typical images. The meeting also pointed out that the creation of feature films in our country should strive to rapidly increase production and gradually improve quality; all aspects of our country's film industry must implement the mass line and select talents from the masses. The meeting also made a preliminary study on the issue of opposing bourgeois idealism in literature and art in the film industry.

    电影局举行故事片创作会议
    文化部电影局最近举行了故事片创作会议，检查了一九五四年摄制的影片，讨论如何生产更多更好的故事片。参加会议的有电影剧本作家、导演、演员共一百五十多人。
    会议期间，电影艺术家们反复观看了他们自己去年所创作的十几部故事片，就这些影片的编剧、导演、表演等各方面作了综合的和分别的研究；他们还先后听了关于我国文化工作一九五五年的方针任务、关于第二次全苏作家代表大会、关于苏联电影事业和苏联电影中的人物创造等报告。
    有三十多个电影剧本作家、导演、演员就自己的创作经验等问题在会上发了言。会议指出：在学习社会主义现实主义的过程中，我国故事片的生产，去年有了显著的进步，制出了如“渡江侦察记”等为群众所喜爱的影片；但它还远远落后于人民的需要，祖国在伟大的社会主义建设中许多尖锐的斗争没有得到反映，影片中所揭发的生活冲突都不很深刻，正面人物的形象不够真实和生动。
    会议明确指出：今后故事片的题材必须更加扩大，同时电影艺术工作者必须在掌握马克思列宁主义、深入研究生活的基础上重视艺术的特征，通过典型形象的创造来揭示生活中的复杂的矛盾和冲突。会议还指出：我国故事片创作应争取迅速增加产量并逐步提高质量；我国电影事业的各个环节都必须贯彻群众路线，从群众中选拔人材。会议也对在电影事业中反对资产阶级唯心主义文艺思想的问题作了初步的研究。　　　　　（据新华社讯）
