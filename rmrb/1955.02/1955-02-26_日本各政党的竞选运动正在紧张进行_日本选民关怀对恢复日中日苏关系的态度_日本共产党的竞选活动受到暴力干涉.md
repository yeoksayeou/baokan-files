Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 24th: The Japanese general election on February 27th is approaching, and the election campaigns of various Japanese political parties are in full swing.

    Reports indicate that Japanese voters have been paying close attention to the attitudes of various political parties towards promoting the normalization of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet relations. The Japanese Communist Party has consistently advocated the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China and the Soviet Union, peaceful coexistence with all countries, the elimination of all artificial trade restrictions, and the development of economic and cultural exchanges between Japan and neighboring countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. Its election campaign has received enthusiastic support and welcome from voters. The police authorities are already worried that the number of votes obtained by the Japanese Communist Party will increase significantly. The joint platform of the left and right-wing Socialist parties also advocates concluding peace treaties and trade agreements with China and the Soviet Union, and completely abolishing "embargo" restrictions. The Democratic Party put forward the slogan of "making peace with the Soviet Union and trading with Communist China" in its election campaign. At the same time, the leaders of the Democratic Party have repeatedly stated that this policy should be carried out on the basis of strengthening "cooperation" with the United States. The Liberal Party still opposes restoring normal relations with China and the Soviet Union. Many reports say that the Liberal Party, which has consistently pursued pro-American policies and is riddled with corruption, will find it difficult to maintain its original seats in this election.

    At the same time, as in past general elections, Japanese progressive forces are campaigning under extremely difficult conditions. A spokesman for the Japanese Communist Party pointed out on the 23rd that the Japanese Communist Party's election activities have been subjected to violent interference.

    The various political parties have launched intense struggles over the issues of amending the constitution and reviving militarism. Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama has made it clear that if the Democratic Party and the Liberal Party, the two conservative parties, control a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives in the election, they will begin to amend the constitution that prohibits rearmament. The danger that conservative factions may intensify rearmament and revive militarism after the election has aroused the attention of voters. Twelve well-known figures in Japanese cultural circles, including former University of Tokyo President Shigeru Nanbara, Hosei University President Hyoe Ouchi, and critic Yoshio Nakano, issued a "Statement to All Voters to Prevent Constitutional Revision" on the 20th, and visited the headquarters of the left and right-wing Socialist parties, the Labor-Farmer Party, and the Japanese Communist Party, four parties that oppose rearmament, calling on voters and these parties to work hard to ensure that the four parties obtain at least one-third of the seats in the House of Representatives in order to defeat the conservative factions' attempts to amend the constitution and restore conscription.

    For the sake of peace and independence, the Japanese Communist Party announced on the 23rd that it would withdraw approximately 25 of its 99 candidates and support other candidates who oppose rearmament in the relevant constituencies in order to strengthen the united front against rearmament.

    Masaru Saito, Director-General of the Japanese National Police Agency, admitted on the 23rd that bribery incidents have broken the record of past general elections. It is well known that the Japanese conservative parties, supported by big business circles, have ample "election" funds. Nevertheless, Japanese newspapers and news agencies say that after the election, no single party will be able to control a majority of seats in the House of Representatives.

    日本选民关怀对恢复日中日苏关系的态度
    日本共产党的竞选活动受到暴力干涉
    【新华社二十四日讯】东京消息：二月二十七日日本大选日期已经迫近，日本各政党的竞选运动正在紧张的进行。
    消息表明：日本广大选民一直非常注意各政党对于促使日中、日苏关系正常化的态度。日本共产党一贯主张日本和中、苏两国恢复邦交，和一切国家和平共处，取消一切人为的贸易限制，在平等互惠的基础上发展日本和邻国的经济和文化交流。它的竞选活动受到选民热烈支持和欢迎。警察当局已在担心日共获得的选票将要大量增加。左、右两派社会党的联合纲领也主张和中、苏两国缔结和约并且缔结贸易协定，完全取消“禁运”限制。民主党在竞选中提出了“同苏联缔和，同共产党中国贸易”的口号。同时，民主党的领袖一再声明，这种政策要在加强和美国“合作”的基础上进行。自由党仍旧反对同中、苏两国恢复正常关系。许多消息说，一贯执行亲美政策和贪污腐败的自由党在这次大选中将难以保持原有议席。
    同时，和过去历次大选一样，日本进步力量是在极端困难的条件下竞选的。日本共产党发言人在二十三日指出：日共的竞选活动受到暴力的干涉。
    各政党在修改宪法、复活军国主义的问题上展开了紧张的斗争。首相鸠山一郎已经明白表示：如果民主党和自由党这两个保守政党在选举中控制了众议院三分之二的多数，就要着手修改禁止重新武装的宪法。保守党派企图在大选后加紧重新武装和复活军国主义的危险已经引起选民的重视。日本文化界著名人士前东京大学校长南原繁、法政大学校长大内兵卫、评论家中野好夫等十二人在二十日发表了“为防止修改宪法告全体选民书”，并且访问了左、右两派社会党、劳农党和日本共产党四个反对重新武装的政党总部，呼吁选民和这些政党努力确保四个党至少获得众议院三分之一以上的议席，以击败保守党派修改宪法和恢复征兵制的企图。
    日本共产党为了和平和独立的利益，在二十三日宣布将撤销九十九个候选人中的约二十五人，在有关选区支持其他的反对重新武装的候选人，以加强反对重新武装的竞选统一战线。
    日本警察厅长官斋藤升在二十三日承认，贿选事件打破了过去历次大选时的纪录。人们都知道，日本保守党派得到大企业界的支持，是拥有充足的
  “竞选”资金的。尽管如此，日本报纸和通讯社都说：大选后，仍将不会有一个党能控制众议院的过半数议席。
