Xinhua News Agency: People's Banks in various locations are actively preparing for the issuance of the new Renminbi. State-owned commercial departments and private businesses in cities such as the capital, Shanghai, and Wuhan have begun to price goods in the new Renminbi.

    People's Banks in various locations have universally established exchange institutions. The Wuhan branch of the People's Bank of China has mobilized more than 400 cadres for the new currency exchange work. More than 110 exchange stations will be established throughout the city. More than 30 townships in the suburbs will have exchange offices in every township, and there will also be many mobile exchange teams. The new Renminbi exchange points and mobile service teams established or entrusted by the Guangzhou People's Bank have been spread throughout the city. Along the banks of the Pearl River, there will be more than a dozen exchange points mainly for the exchange of tens of thousands of residents living on the water. The People's Bank has also set up a special exchange point in the Overseas Chinese Reception Center in Shipai to facilitate the exchange of returned overseas Chinese. Hundreds of trained business personnel in Chongqing arrived at 173 exchange points with the new currency on February 26 and are enthusiastically arranging exchange offices for citizens exchanging the new currency. The Hubei Branch of the People's Bank of China has transported all the new Renminbi needed for the exchange of people in Hubei to various exchange points. In addition to the 895 branches, sub-branches, agencies, offices and business offices of the People's Bank of China in Hubei Province handling the exchange work, state-owned stores, supply and marketing cooperatives, and some credit cooperatives will also handle the exchange on their behalf. At least two exchange points have been set up in each market town. In remote areas, banks have also organized many mobile exchange teams to facilitate farmers to exchange at any time.

    Many state-owned stores and private stores' employees are carefully pricing goods in the new Renminbi. Employees in the main industries of private cotton cloth, department stores, etc. in the capital require that there should be no errors in the conversion of new and old currencies. Dahua Department Store has completed the new pricing of thousands of commodities, and employees pay special attention to the pricing of each new commodity, and have carefully carried out profit accounting. In the pricing work, the employees of Wangfu Department Store also enthusiastically learned the foreign language unit names of yuan, jiao, and fen to facilitate international friends to purchase goods. Price cards marked in yuan, jiao, and fen can now be seen in large and small stores in Shanghai. All commodities in the city's state-owned commercial and cooperative stores have been marked with both new and old Renminbi prices. The employees of the State-owned Shanghai No. 1 Department Store marked the new currency prices for more than ten thousand commodities on the evening of the 21st and rearranged the commodities in some counters. Most of the shops in 59 private industries such as cotton cloth, new medicines, wine and food, and cotton ginning, as well as many small vegetable markets and vendors, have also completed the pricing work. Many private stores that did not mark prices in the past are now marking prices under the promotion of employees. On February 26, the salespersons of state-owned businesses and cooperatives in Wuhan began to fill out new price cards for more than 65,000 commodities. The new card also indicates the price in the two calculation units of the new and old Renminbi. The Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Commerce has accurately converted all commodities in the Wuhan market according to the value of the new and old currencies and made a price list, which will be distributed to various state-owned companies, cooperatives, private industrial and commercial industries, and vegetable and vendor markets in the city. Employees of state-owned food and trading companies in Chongqing have also completed a comparison table of the conversion of new and old currency prices, and have distributed them to various private industries to help private business households convert prices.
