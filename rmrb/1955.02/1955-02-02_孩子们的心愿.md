Children's Wishes
Jiang Ming

Last December, after the news of our People's Navy sinking the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's "Taiping" warship off the coast of Zhejiang reached the fleet, the sailors of a certain ship received a package from the Fifth Squadron of the Young Pioneers of the Central Primary School in Zhuji Town, Zhejiang Province. The package contained a thick stack of letter paper printed with bright red "Victory Report" characters and dozens of envelopes. An attached letter read:

"Dear Naval Uncles: We are very happy that you sank Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army's 'Taiping' warship. Because you are fighting bravely on the front lines, we can study peacefully in the rear like we are now. ... We hope you will win more battles and use all the victory report paper we sent. We will study hard to repay you, uncles."

This letter brought great comfort to the sailors, but it also made them feel a greater sense of responsibility. In order to fulfill the children's wishes, the sailors' desire to strike hard at Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army grew stronger. The sailors practiced again and again, and the engine room soldiers meticulously checked every part of the machines like doctors every day. Each gunner actively studied shooting techniques. Liu Yupeng, the chief gunner of the forward main gun, painstakingly studied and created a new method for shooting at surface targets, effectively improving the shooting hit rate. Liu Houlun, the range setter, also rapidly improved the range setting speed in a very short time.

On January 18th, the moment to fulfill the children's wishes arrived, and the sailors were ordered to provide cover for the army's landing to liberate Yijiangshan Island.

In the afternoon, the warship sailed into the ×× sea. At this time, the People's Liberation Army's artillery and air force were pouring large quantities of shells and bombs onto the positions of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army on Yijiangshan Island.

The sailors also joined the battle. The ship's cannons roared incessantly, and continuous streams of shells overturned the fortifications of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit army, and the corpses of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit soldiers flew into the air. When the front and rear main guns fired three rounds in rapid succession and silenced the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army's anti-landing guns on Yijiangshan Island, Captain Fei, standing on the command platform, could no longer suppress his excitement. He shouted, "Pass it down, the aimers of the front and rear main guns will all be given a third-class merit!"

"Strive for everyone to receive a commendation!" When the gunners heard the captain's order, they shouted together.

An hour later, the sailors cooperated with fraternal units to successfully complete the task of covering the army's landing.

The next day, the sailors excitedly wrote back to the children, "Dear children... On January 18th, we cooperated with fraternal units to liberate Yijiangshan Island, completely, thoroughly, and entirely annihilating more than 1,000 Chiang Kai-shek bandit soldiers on the island. We have initially fulfilled your wishes. We are determined to make persistent efforts, strive to fight more beautiful battles, and send you more victory reports. We hope you study hard and strive for the best academic results. This is the greatest encouragement to us." (Xinhua News Agency)

    孩子们的心愿
    江明
    去年十二月，当浙江前线我人民海军击沉蒋贼“太平号”军舰的消息传出以后，某舰的水兵们接到了浙江诸暨城关镇中心小学少年先锋队第五中队寄来的一个邮包，邮包里面包着厚厚的一叠印有鲜红的“捷报”字样的信笺和数十个信封，附在邮包里的一封信上写着：
    “亲爱的海军叔叔：你们打沉了蒋贼军的‘太平号’军舰，我们心里真高兴。因为有你们在前线英勇的作战，我们才能像现在这样安稳地在后方念书。……希望叔叔再多打胜仗，把我们寄去的捷报笺都用上。我们一定好好念书，报答叔叔。”
    这封信给水兵们带来了很大的快慰，但同时也使水兵们更感到责任的重大。为了实现孩子们的心愿，水兵们要求痛击蒋贼军的情绪越来越高，水兵们一次又一次地操演，轮机兵整天像医生一样细致地检查着机器上的每一个机件。各炮手积极钻研射击技术。前主炮瞄准手刘玉鹏苦心钻研，创造了射击水面目标的新办法，有效地提高了射击命中率。定距手刘后伦也在很短的时间内迅速提高了定距速度。
    一月十八日，实现孩子们的愿望的时刻到了，水兵们奉命掩护陆军登陆解放一江山岛。
    下午，军舰驶进了××海面。这时人民解放军的炮兵和空军机群正把大批的炮弹、炸弹倾泻到一江山岛蒋贼军阵地上。
    水兵们也投入战斗了。舰上大炮不停地吼叫着，连珠般的炮弹连续地掀翻了蒋贼军的工事，空中飞起了蒋贼军的尸体。当前后主炮快放三发打哑了一江山岛上蒋贼军的战防炮时，站立在指挥台上的费舰长再也压抑不住兴奋的心情，他喊道：“往下传，前后主炮的瞄准手，一律记三等功！”
    “争取全体立功！”当炮手们听到舰长的命令后，一齐喊了起来。
    一个小时以后，水兵们配合兄弟部队胜利地完成了掩护陆军登陆的任务。
    第二天，水兵们兴奋地给孩子们写了回信，信上写道：“亲爱的小朋友……一月十八日，我们配合兄弟部队解放了一江山岛，干脆、彻底、全部歼灭了岛上蒋贼军一千多名。我们初步实现了你们的心愿。我们决心再接再厉，争取打更多的漂亮仗，寄更多的捷报给你们。希望你们好好念书，争取最优良的学习成绩。这就是对我们最大的鼓励。”　（新华社）
