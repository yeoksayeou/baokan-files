New Achievements in Industrial Production in Andong City

Andong City is a light industrial city, especially known as the "Silk City." The silk it produces has been sold abroad in the past and continues to be sold abroad now. Last year, due to the extensive technical innovation movement carried out by workers, the output and quality of silk have been significantly improved, and many new products have been trial-produced. The sales volume of Andong City's silk fabrics in the domestic market is increasing daily. In the border areas of the motherland, such as Hainan Island, Xinjiang, and Inner Mongolia, people can now wear silk made from tussah silk produced here. Large quantities of silk fabrics are also continuously transported to fraternal countries such as the Soviet Union and Romania. One of the main products of the spun silk factory – artificial fur made from tussah silk cocoons – is also very popular. Its sales area has expanded from eleven cities in five provinces in 1953 to forty-four cities in twenty-four provinces last year, reaching as far as Qinghai and Xinjiang, with sales increasing more than fivefold. To meet the needs of the people, the tussah silk weaving industry in Andong City trial-produced a large number of new products last year, including successfully trial-produced insulated wire for electrical use, blankets, uniform materials, velvet, jacquard Tianxiang silk, silk serge, scarves, headscarves, etc.

In addition to producing dozens of types of tussah silk fabrics, state-owned and local state-owned industries throughout the city also produce hundreds of daily necessities such as paper, toothpaste, fountain pens, rubber shoes, sewing needles, and ink. Andong City's papermaking industry has a history of more than 30 years. Currently, the office paper, thin paper, and Manila paper produced by various paper mills are selling well. The "Changbai Toothpaste" produced by the Andong Daily Chemical Factory is now sold throughout the country, and its output last year more than doubled compared to the previous year.

    安东市工业生产的新成就
    安东市是一座轻工业城市，特别是素有“丝绸城市”之称，它所生产的丝绸，过去和现在都远销国外。去年，由于工人们广泛地开展了技术革新运动，丝绸的产量和质量都有了显著的提高，并且试制了许多新产品。安东市的丝织品在国内的销售量正在日益增加。在祖国的边疆地区，像海南岛、新疆和内蒙古等地的人民，现在也能够穿到这里的柞蚕丝绸了。大批丝织品还源源不断地运往苏联、罗马尼亚等兄弟国家。绢纺工厂的主要产品之一——用柞蚕茧制出的人造毛皮，也颇受欢迎。它的销售区域从一九五三年的五个省十一个市，扩大到去年的二十四个省四十四个市，最远销到青海、新疆等地，销售额增加了五倍多。为了满足人民的需要，去年安东市的柞蚕丝织工业试制了大批新产品，已经试制成功的有机电用的绝缘线、毯子、制服料、金丝绒、提花的天香绢、绢丝尼、围巾、头巾等。
    全市国营和地方国营工业除了生产数十种柞蚕丝织品外，还生产纸张、牙膏、金笔、胶鞋、缝衣针、墨水等上百种的生活日用品。安东市的造纸工业已有三十多年的历史，目前各造纸厂生产的办公纸、薄页纸和马尼拉纸，销路很广。安东日用化学工厂出产的“长白牙膏”，现已销行全国，去年的产量比前年增加了一倍以上。（安东市报编辑部）
