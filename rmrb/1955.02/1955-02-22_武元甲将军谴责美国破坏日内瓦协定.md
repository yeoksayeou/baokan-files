Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 21st: According to the Vietnam News Agency, General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, spoke at a reception held by the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army on February 18th to welcome the Vietnamese People's Army troops withdrawing from South Vietnam to the North. In his speech, he condemned the US imperialists' actions in undermining the Geneva Accords and denounced the US conspiracy to create tension in the Taiwan area and convene the Bangkok meeting of the Manila Treaty Organization.

General Vo Nguyen Giap said: The completion of the transfer of Vietnamese People's Army troops from South Vietnam to North Vietnam is of great political significance. This fully demonstrates the Vietnamese military and people's desire for peace and proves the Democratic Republic of Vietnam government's policy of earnestly implementing the Geneva Armistice Agreement.

However, while our troops in South Vietnam faithfully carried out the ceasefire order and conducted military regroupment, the other side repeatedly took terrorist actions against residents, peace fighters, and those who advocated national unification and democracy, infringing upon the people's democratic freedoms.

General Vo Nguyen Giap pointed out: As soon as the Geneva Armistice Agreement was concluded, the US imperialists plotted the Manila Treaty in order to undermine the achievements of the Geneva Conference and drag South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia into an aggressive military bloc. The Manila Treaty undeniably and seriously violates the Geneva Armistice Agreement. Recently, the US imperialists sent the Collins mission to South Vietnam. They shamelessly interfered in South Vietnam's internal affairs; they openly helped their puppets increase their troop strength, directly responsible for training and equipping Ngo Dinh Diem's army, strengthening the terrorist measures against civilians and creating instability in South Vietnam. These are all undeniable acts of sabotaging the Geneva Armistice Agreement.

General Vo Nguyen Giap pointed out: While the US imperialists are stepping up the rearmament of West German fascists in Europe, they are creating tension in the Taiwan area in the East and convening a "Southeast Asia Treaty Organization" meeting in Bangkok in order to further advance their aggressive conspiracy in Southeast Asia, including the conspiracy to enslave South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.

The US imperialists, the French colonialists who are undermining the armistice agreement, and their lackeys are currently doing everything possible to undermine peace, obstruct the unification of Vietnam, and turn South Vietnam into a US war base and colony.

General Vo Nguyen Giap said: The Vietnamese people must stop the clutches of the US imperialists. In the patriotic war, we fought victoriously. In peacetime, we must fight to consolidate peace, complete unification, and achieve national independence and democracy. We must fight to the end to smash all the conspiracies of the US imperialists and their running dogs. General Vo Nguyen Giap also said: Vietnam's territory is a unified territory. Our beloved motherland must be unified. Any conspiracy aimed at dividing the North and South, and anyone who opposes our people's will to demand national unification, is doomed to failure.

General Vo Nguyen Giap finally pointed out that the Vietnamese people have deep confidence in consolidating peace, completing unification, and achieving national independence and democracy.

    武元甲将军谴责美国破坏日内瓦协定
     【新华社二十一日讯】据越南通讯社河内二十日讯：越南人民军总司令武元甲将军十八日在越南人民军总司令部欢迎自南越北撤的越南人民军部队的招待会上讲了话。他在讲话中谴责美帝国主义者破坏日内瓦协议的行为，并且谴责美国在台湾地区制造紧张局势和召开马尼拉条约组织曼谷会议的阴谋。
    武元甲将军说：越南人民军部队从南越调往北越工作的完成具有很大的政治意义。这充分证明越南军民的和平愿望，证明越南民主共和国政府认真履行日内瓦停战协定的政策。
    但是，当我们在南越的军队忠实地执行停火命令和进行军事集结的时候，对方却反复地对居民、和平战士和那些主张国家统一和民主的人采取恐怖行动，侵犯了人民的民主自由。
    武元甲将军指出：日内瓦停战协定刚一缔结，美帝国主义者就策划了马尼拉条约，以便破坏日内瓦会议的成果，把南越、老挝和柬埔寨拉入侵略军事集团。马尼拉条约无可争辩地严重违反了日内瓦停战协定。最近，美帝国主义者派柯林斯使团到南越。他们厚颜无耻地干涉南越的内政；他们公开帮助他们的仆从增加兵力，直接负责训练和装备吴庭艳军队，加强对平民的恐怖措施和造成南越的不稳定局势。这些全是无可否认的破坏日内瓦停战协定的行为。
    武元甲将军指出：美帝国主义者一方面在欧洲加紧重新武装西德法西斯主义者，一方面在东方的台湾地区制造紧张局势，在曼谷召开“东南亚条约组织”会议，以便进一步推进它们在东南亚的侵略阴谋，包括奴役南越、老挝和柬埔寨的阴谋。
    美帝国主义者、破坏停战协定的法国殖民分子和他们的走狗，目前正在千方百计地破坏和平，阻挠越南的统一，把南越变成美国的战争基地和殖民地。
    武元甲将军说：越南人民必须制止美帝国主义者的魔掌。在爱国战争中，我们胜利地进行了战斗，在和平时期，我们必须为巩固和平、完成统一、实现全国独立和民主而斗争。我们必须斗争到底，粉碎美帝国主义者和他们的走狗的一切阴谋。武元甲将军又说：越南的领土是统一的领土。我们的可爱的祖国必须统一。目的在于分裂南北部的任何阴谋，以及反对我们人民要求全国统一的意志的任何人，都是注定要失败的。
    武元甲将军最后指出，越南人民对于巩固和平、完成统一、实现全国独立和民主，深有信心。
