Responding to the U.S. Imperialist Warmongering with Practical Actions
Le Songsheng, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Industry and Commerce

The Chinese people understand "love" and "hate."

Our sharp eyes clearly see: Who is ferociously interfering in China's internal affairs, sheltering the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique that has been spurned by the Chinese people, obstructing the Chinese people from exercising their sovereignty, liberating their sacred territories of Taiwan, Penghu, and the coastal islands, deploying troops at sea, and openly provoking the 600 million Chinese people in a shameless manner, and intimidating the Chinese people with atomic weapons. At the same time, we clearly see: Who is extending a warm hand of friendship, proposing to provide the People's Republic of China with scientific, technical, and industrial assistance in promoting the research of peaceful uses of atomic energy. The Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate the new and old hatred for U.S. imperialist aggression! Therefore, in addition to expressing our joyful sentiments towards the generous assistance of the great Soviet Union, with fraternal friendship, in the peaceful utilization of atomic energy, the industrial and commercial circles of our capital, in order to give a stern warning to the U.S. aggressor group that is brandishing atomic weapons and clamoring for war, resolutely support the "Resolution on Launching a Signature Campaign Against the Use of Atomic Weapons" by the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace. We call on all industrialists, business people, and people from all walks of life in the city to enthusiastically sign the "Appeal to the People of the World" issued by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council. We also guarantee that under the management of state organs, the leadership of the state-owned economy, and the supervision of the working masses, we will give full play to our patriotic spirit, actively improve production and management, sincerely accept socialist transformation, and enthusiastically purchase the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds. With practical actions, we will resolutely struggle to accelerate the socialist construction of the country, to support the liberation of Taiwan, and to defend lasting peace in the Far East and the world!

    以实际行动回答美帝国主义的战争叫嚣
    北京市工商业联合会主任委员　乐松生
    中国人民是懂得“爱”和“憎”的。
    我们雪亮的眼睛清清楚楚地看到了：是谁在穷凶极恶地干涉中国的内政，庇护被中国人民唾弃了的蒋介石卖国集团，阻挠中国人民行使自己的主权，解放属于自己的神圣领土台湾、澎湖及沿海岛屿，并陈兵海上，公然对六万万中国人民进行无耻的挑衅，并以原子武器恫吓中国人民。同时也清清楚楚地看到了：是谁伸出了温暖的友谊之手，提出了在促进和平利用原子能的研究方面给予中华人民共和国以科学、技术和工业上的帮助的建议。中国人民对于美帝国主义侵略的新仇旧恨，是绝对不能容忍的！因此，我们首都工商界除了以欢欣鼓舞的心情，对于怀着兄弟般友谊的伟大的苏联在原子能和平利用方面所给予的慷慨帮助，表示热烈的欢迎外，并为了给予挥舞原子武器、叫嚣战争的美国侵略集团以严正的警告，我们坚决地拥护中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员联席扩大会议“关于发动反对使用原子武器签名运动的决议”，号召全市工商业者和各界人民一道踊跃地在世界和平理事会常务委员会所发出的“告全世界人民书”上签名；并保证在国家机关的管理、国营经济的领导和工人群众的监督下，充分发挥爱国主义精神，积极改进生产经营，诚恳地接受社会主义改造，并踊跃认购一九五五年国家经济建设公债，以实际的行动，为加速国家的社会主义建设，为支援解放台湾，为保卫远东及世界的持久和平而坚决奋斗！
