    Rationally Handle Sideline Income to Help Commune Members Overcome Disaster
    Liu Tong Sun Jingshan

    Last October, the accounting office of the "Chongfeng" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Niubaiwan, Ba County, Hebei Province, suddenly became "lively." Commune members came to borrow money one after another, and the accountant was extremely busy.
    This cooperative was expanded from 41 households to 124 large households in September last year. Due to continuous floods, some commune members had difficulties in their lives. The cooperative management committee decided to change the profit distribution method of sideline income to advance distribution every half month starting in September. The implementation of this method did indeed solve the family life problems of some poor commune members. However, some commune members borrowed money from the cooperative before the half-month dividend. Commune member Ma Ruxing had mats stored at home but didn't sell them, and Huang Zhenqiang's family still had half a month's worth of grain, but they also went to the cooperative to borrow money. Seeing this person borrow, that person also wanted to borrow; the more people who borrowed money, the more anxious everyone became and "grabbed" to borrow. By the end of October last year, more than 60 households had borrowed money; in half a month, the total sideline production income of the entire cooperative was 2.9 million yuan, but more than 2.8 million yuan was borrowed. Seeing this situation, poor commune members began to worry about not having enough to eat in the future; wealthy households were also afraid that they would not be able to get their share of the money. As a result, many commune members were not active in production. Cooperative cadres felt unable to lead and were afraid that the cooperative would collapse; individual cadres even wanted to resign.
    This situation attracted the attention of the Party branch. General branch committee member Sun Shoushan (the cooperative director) and several other branch committee members studied the situation together. Everyone analyzed the reasons for the high level of borrowing, mainly due to the relaxation of political and ideological leadership after the expansion of the cooperative. The policy of "relying on poor peasants and uniting with middle peasants" was not fully implemented, and many commune members did not clearly understand the significance of "collective production to overcome the disaster." They always wanted to get some cash in their own hands. In addition, cooperative cadres were not clear about the economic situation of the new commune members' families. Some poor commune members did not put all their labor into production, resulting in less profit sharing and difficulties in their lives, and the cooperative did not take good care of them. Based on this situation, the branch decided to first educate the commune members to raise their awareness; then, by carefully calculating accounts, understanding the actual income and expenditure of each household and their work attendance, and calling on commune members to "actively produce and save to overcome the famine," they would base their lives on production and break the mentality of dependence. They decided to start with the third production team.
    The third production team has a total of 29 households, of which 14 households regularly borrowed money from the cooperative. Cooperative cadres explained the principle of mutual benefit of agricultural production cooperatives to the commune members, explaining the reasoning that "borrowing more money now means less grain will be distributed in the future." After that, several commune members carefully calculated their accounts and believed that as long as they saved well and put all the able-bodied people in their families into production, they could maintain their lives, dispelling the idea of relying on the cooperative for loans. Six households in the team were indeed facing greater difficulties. The team allowed them to appropriately advance more money during the half-month dividend based on their work attendance and actual expenditures. They guaranteed to the cooperative that they would complete the production tasks stipulated by the cooperative; the cooperative allowed them to advance expenses sufficient to maintain the entire family's life. Doing so can enable all commune members to overcome the disaster and benefit the cooperative's production. At the same time, education on mutual assistance, unity, and production was also carried out among the commune members. Everyone also decided to prioritize arranging production for poor commune members so that their lives would not be affected due to lack of work. After this arrangement, the commune members dispelled their worries, and their enthusiasm for labor also increased. Commune member Huang Wenbo's family has a total of five people, originally unable to do ten workdays in half a month; after doing this, they did thirteen workdays in half a month, and the half-month dividend was enough to maintain the entire family's life, without the need to borrow money from the cooperative.
    The experience gained in the third team was promoted in all five teams of the cooperative. The number of borrowers gradually decreased, the cooperative's financial income and expenditure became normal, and the labor potential of the vast number of commune members was also brought into play. Commune member Huang Zhenwen's wife had never done any work for the cooperative in the past, but now she spun more than 30 jin of thread for weaving sacks for the cooperative; the women of Huang Zhenwu and three or four other families were previously not active in participating in the cooperative's labor, but now they are actively participating in sideline production such as embroidery and weaving mats. The songs of the spinning group and the mat weaving group became loud and clear; the accounting office was no longer crowded with people clamoring to borrow money. Poor peasant commune members said: As long as we work hard, we don't have to worry about not having food to eat. Middle peasant commune members said: This method is good, it is reasonable to advance more money to those who work more and have greater difficulties. Cadres also felt relaxed and happy and no longer worried about borrowing money.

### 合理处理副业收入，帮助社员渡过灾荒

    合理处理副业收入，帮助社员渡过灾荒
    刘彤　孙敬山
    去年十月间，河北省霸县牛百湾“冲锋”农业生产合作社的会计室里忽然“热闹”起来了。社员们络绎不绝地来借钱，会计员忙得不可开交。
    这个社是去年九月由四十一户扩大到一百二十四户的大社。由于连年水灾，有些社员生活困难，社务委员会决定从九月份起把副业收入的分红办法改成半个月预分一次。实行这个办法后，确实解决了一些贫困社员的家庭生活问题。但是，有的社员不等到半月分红就去借钱了。社员马汝兴家里存着席不卖，黄振强家还有半个月的存粮，也都到合作社去借款。看见这个人借，那个人就也要借；借钱的人越多，大家就越着急地“抢”着去借。到去年十月下旬，已有六十多户借了钱；半个月里，全社副业生产收入二百九十万元，却借出了二百八十多万元。看到这个情况，贫苦社员发起愁来，怕将来吃不上饭；富裕户也怕将来分不到钱。这样一来，许多社员在生产上也不积极了。社干部则感到无法领导，怕社垮台；个别干部甚至要辞职不干了。
    这个情况引起了党支部的重视。总支委员孙寿山（社长）和其他几个支委一起研究了这个情况。大家分析借钱多的原因，主要是由于在扩大社以后放松了政治思想领导，“依靠贫农、团结中农”的政策贯彻得不够，许多社员对“集体生产、渡过灾荒”的意义认识不清，总想多捞几个现钱在自己手上；再加上社干部对新社员家庭经济情况摸不清楚，有些贫苦社员没有把全部劳力投入生产，分红较少，生活有困难，社里也没有很好照顾。根据这种情况，支部决定首先对社员进行教育，提高觉悟；再通过算细账，摸清各户实际收支情况和出工情况，号召社员“积极生产、节约渡荒”，以生产定生活，打破依赖思想。他们决定先从第三生产队做起。
    第三生产队共有二十九户，其中有十四户经常向社里借钱。社干部对社员讲清了农业生产合作社的互利原则，说明“现在多借钱、将来少分粮”的道理之后，有几个社员算了细账，认为只要很好地节约，把家中能参加劳动的人都投入生产，就可以维持生活，打消了依赖社里借款的想法。全队有六户确实困难较大，队里根据他们的出工数和实际支出情况，让他们在半月分红时适当多预支一些。他们向社里保证完成社里规定的生产任务；社里让他们预支足以维持全家生活的费用。这样做，可以使全体社员都能渡过灾荒，并且有利于社里的生产。同时，在社员中还进行了互助互济、团结生产的教育。大家还决定优先给贫苦社员安排生产，使他们不致因没活做而影响生活。这样安排以后，社员们打消了顾虑，劳动积极性也提高了。社员黄文波家共五口人，原来半个月内做不到十个劳动日；这样做了以后，半月做了十三个劳动日，半月分红已能够维持全家生活，不需要向社里借钱了。
    第三队取得的这个经验在全社五个队推广开了。借钱的逐渐减少了，社里财政收支正常了，广大社员的劳动潜力也发挥出来了。社员黄振文的妻子过去没有干过社里的活，现在替社里纺了三十多斤织口袋的线；黄振武等三、四家的妇女以前不积极参加社里的劳动，现在也主动参加刺绣、织席等副业生产了。纺线组、织席组的歌声响亮起来；会计办公室里不再挤满了人嚷借钱了。贫农社员说：只要好好干活，就不愁没饭吃。中农社员说：这个办法好，劳动多的困难大的多预支点钱是合理的。干部也感到轻松愉快，不为借钱的事发愁了。
