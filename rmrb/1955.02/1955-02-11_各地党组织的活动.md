    Party Organizations in Guangzhou Admit a Large Number of Outstanding Workers
      According to statistics from four hundred state-owned, locally state-owned, jointly state-private, and private factories and enterprises, as well as basic construction and transportation departments in Guangzhou City, 3,455 outstanding workers, technicians, and enterprise management cadres were admitted into the Chinese Communist Party by Party organizations last year. Workers accounted for the largest proportion. Among the 1,775 new Party members in state-owned, locally state-owned, and jointly state-private factories and enterprises, as well as basic construction and transportation departments, 1,069 were workers. In these factories and enterprises, seven new Party committees, nineteen general branches, and two hundred and three branches were also established.
    These workers, technicians, and enterprise management cadres who joined the Chinese Communist Party have generally been tested by various social reform movements in recent years and are outstanding individuals and model figures who have emerged in production work. Among the 3,455 workers, technicians, and enterprise management cadres who joined the Party last year, there were 61 Guangzhou City labor models and 332 advanced producers and advanced workers.
    Many of the workers who joined the Party last year have become the core and backbone of production work, and some have been promoted to leadership positions, while others have been promoted to cadres and Party workers. For example, among the new Party members admitted by the Guangzhou Municipal Basic Construction Committee last year, one was promoted to deputy director of the construction site, thirteen were promoted to work section chiefs, eight were promoted to cadres, one was promoted to Party organization member, and seven were trained as members of the construction site branch committee.

      Pay Attention to Party Building Among Ethnic Minorities
    Wenchuan County in Sichuan Province is a multi-ethnic area. Based on the characteristics of this area, the Wenchuan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently held a training class for activists of all ethnic groups and provided them with a relatively systematic communist education. After the education, sixteen people who met the requirements for Party membership were admitted into the Party, ten of whom were Qiang nationality. These new Party members are all advanced figures in various tasks. For example, Chen Zongbin, a new Qiang Party member, is a skilled producer and security model.

    Developing New Party Members in the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement
    The socialist consciousness of farmers in Anhui Province has greatly increased in the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Now, more than 47,000 advanced farmers in the province have joined the Communist Party; in addition, more than 100,000 advanced farmers are applying to join the Communist Party, and they are actively creating conditions for joining the Party.
    With the participation of a large number of awakened farmers in the Party organization, Communist Party branches have been established in 80% of the townships throughout the province. These branches have become the core force for leading and consolidating mutual aid and cooperative organizations in rural areas. After the establishment of Party organizations in rural areas of Guoyang County, political work within agricultural producers' cooperatives was quickly strengthened, overcoming the capitalist ideas of some cooperatives that previously neglected agriculture and blindly engaged in commerce. In Shiligang Township, Liu'an County, four newly established cooperatives originally had some wavering members due to a lack of ideological education and poor production management; the Party branch immediately strengthened socialist education for the members through the eleven Party members in these cooperatives, and at the same time implemented a "small contracting" system to improve production management, which consolidated these four cooperatives.

    Study Comrade Khrushchev's Report
    On January 20, the Basic Construction Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party notified the basic construction departments, industrial departments, mining area Party committees, and engineering company Party committees of various cities to study the article "On the Widespread Use of Industrialized Methods in Construction, Improving Quality and Reducing Costs" by N.S. Khrushchev of the Soviet Union, published in the People's Daily on January 13. The notice stated that this article "is very important and has great practical guiding significance for basic construction work."

    Seventh Session of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee Party School Opens
    On January 28, the seventh session of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee Party School opened. More than 400 Party member cadres participated in this session.
    The main courses of this session include: History of the Chinese Communist Party, the Party's General Line during the transition period, the theory of Party building, and Chapters 9 to 12 of the History of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). The teaching policy is: to conduct a more systematic Marxist-Leninist theoretical education, so that students can deeply study the Party's general line during the transition period; to implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party during the learning process, and criticize the bourgeois individualism in the students. This session also opened a preliminary class to meet the learning needs of some cadres with lower cultural levels and weaker theoretical foundations, as well as newly promoted grassroots leaders, to improve their political and ideological levels and their ability to implement policies.

    Arranging Spring Plowing Production Work
    Recently, the Mengjin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Henan Province convened a joint meeting of district committee members, district heads, and leading backbones of agricultural producers' cooperatives to arrange spring plowing production work. Last winter, Mengjin suffered a severe snow disaster, which affected the winter production of many cooperatives, and some people lacked confidence in whether production could be increased this year. However, a few cooperatives were blindly optimistic, saying, "If wheat is covered three times, you can sleep with your head on an oil bun." Most cooperatives in the county had not yet started preparing for spring plowing. In response to the above situation, the meeting criticized these two erroneous views and decided that the district committees should lead the agricultural producers' cooperatives to do a good job in wheat field management on the one hand, and seize the time to prepare for spring plowing on the other hand; prepare seeds, fertilizers, livestock, and agricultural tools to create conditions for ensuring increased agricultural production.

    各地党组织的活动
    广州大批优秀职工入党
      去年广州市的四百个国营、地方国营、公私合营、私营工厂企业及基本建设、交通运输部门的统计，去年一年中有三千四百五十五个优秀工人、技术人员和企业管理干部被党组织接收为中国共产党党员。其中工人占的比例最大。在国营、地方国营和公私合营工厂企业和基本建设、交通运输部门的
  一千七百七十五个新党员中，工人占了一千零六十九个。在这些工厂企业中还新建了党的委员会七个，总支十九个和支部二百零三个。
    这批参加中国共产党的工人、技术人员和企业管理干部，一般都是经过几年来各种社会改革运动的考验、在生产工作中涌现出来的优秀分子和模范人物。在去年入党的三千四百五十五个工人、技术人员和企业管理干部中，广州市劳动模范即有六十一人，先进生产者和先进工作者三百三十二人。
    去年入党的工人中，很多已经成为生产工作中的核心和骨干，有一部分已被提拔担任领导工作，有的被提拔为干部和党的工作人员。如中共广州市基本建设委员会去年接收的新党员中，有一个被提拔为工地副主任，十三个被提拔为工段长，八个被提拔为干部，一个被提拔为建党组织员，并有七个被培养为工地支部委员会委员。（南）
      注意在少数民族中建党
    四川省汶川县是个多民族聚居的地区，中共汶川县委会根据这一地区的特点，最近举办了各族人民积极分子训练班，对他们进行了比较系统的共产主义教育。经过教育并接收了已具备入党条件的十六人入党，其中有十人是羌族。这些新党员都是在各项工作中的先进人物。如新入党的羌族人陈宗彬，就是一个生产能手和治安模范。

    在互助合作运动中发展新党员
    安徽省农民在互助合作运动中社会主义觉悟有了很大提高，现在全省有四万七千多个农民先进分子参加了共产党；另外有十万多个农民先进分子要求参加共产党，他们正在积极创造入党的条件。
    随着大批觉悟了的农民参加到党的组织里来，全省已有百分之八十的乡建立了共产党的支部。这些支部已成了农村中领导和巩固互助合作组织的核心力量。涡阳县农村普遍建立了党的组织以后，很快加强了农业生产合作社内的政治工作，克服了部分社原来忽视农业、盲目经营商业的资本主义思想。六安县十里岗乡有四个新建社，原来因缺乏思想教育和生产管理不善，使一些社员动摇不定；党支部立刻通过这些社中的十一个党员加强对社员的社会主义教育，同时推行“小包工”制度，改进生产管理，使这四个社得到了巩固。（新华社）
    学习赫鲁晓夫同志的报告
    中共黑龙江省委基本建设部于一月二十日通知各市委基本建设部、工业部、矿区党委、工程公司党委学习人民日报一月十三日刊载的苏联尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫“论在建筑中广泛采用工业化方法，改善质量和降低造价”一文，通知中说，这篇论文“很重要，对基本建设工作有极大的现实指导意义”。

    北京市委党校第七期开学
    一月二十八日，中共北京市委党校第七期开学了。参加这一期学习的党员干部有四百多人。
    这一期学习的主要课程有：中国共产党历史、党在过渡时期的总路线、党的建设理论和联共（布）党史第九章到十二章等。教学的方针是：进行较系统的马克思列宁主义的理论教育，使学员深入地学习党在过渡时期的总路线；学习过程中贯彻党的四中全会决议的精神，批判学员中的资产阶级个人主义思想。这一期还开办了初级班次，以满足一部分文化水平较低、理论基础较差的干部和新提拔的基层领导干部的学习要求，提高他们的政治思想水平和执行政策的能力。（京）
    布置春耕生产工作
    最近，中共河南孟津县委召开了各区区委员、区长和农业生产合作社的领导骨干联席会议，布置春耕生产工作。去年冬季孟津大雪成灾，很多社的冬季生产受到影响，有一部分人对今年能否增产缺乏信心，但也有少数社盲目乐观，说什么“麦盖三重被，头枕油馍睡”。全县大部分社都没有开始准备春耕工作。针对以上情况，会上批判了这两种错误看法，同时决定各区委应领导农业生产合作社一面要做好麦田管理工作，一面抓紧时间做好春耕准备工作；备好种籽、肥料、牲畜、农具，为确保农业增产创造条件。
