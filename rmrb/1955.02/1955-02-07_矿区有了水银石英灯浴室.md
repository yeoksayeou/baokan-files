    Mercury Quartz Lamp Bathrooms in Mining Areas

    (Our Hunan Reporter Station) Mercury quartz lamp bathrooms have been set up in mining areas such as the Hunan Xikuangshan and Shuikoushan mines. In the past, miners often worked in the mines for many years, had little chance to see sunlight, and were prone to anemia, insomnia, and other diseases. Recently, the Mining Bureau has successively established mercury quartz lamp bathrooms at the pitheads of these factories and mines. Workers can irradiate themselves with ultraviolet rays emitted by the mercury quartz lamps at any time, which can not only prevent anemia, insomnia and other diseases, but also increase workers' appetite and refresh their spirits. The workers are very moved by this care and have expressed their determination to improve work efficiency and better complete production tasks.

    矿区有了水银石英灯浴室
    湖南锡矿山和水口山等矿区已有了水银石英灯浴室。采矿工人们过去常年在矿井里工作，见阳光的机会很少，易于患贫血、失眠等病症。最近，矿务局已先后在这些厂矿建立了坑口水银石英灯浴室，工人们可以随时照射水银石英灯发射的紫外线，不但可以预防贫血、失眠等病症，而且可使工人们食欲增加，精神焕发。工人们对这种关怀非常感动，纷纷表示要提高工作效率，更好地完成生产任务。　（本报湖南记者站）
