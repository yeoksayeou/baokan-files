Capital Literary and Art Circles Hold Signing Rally

[This Newspaper Despatch] On the 17th, the literary and art circles in the capital held a signing rally against the use of atomic weapons. More than 800 people attended. The meeting was presided over by Mao Dun. Ding Ling, Mei Lanfang, Lao She, Tian Han, Qi Baishi, Chen Qitong, Zhang Ruifang, Zhou Weizhi, Shi Dongshan, and Wu Zuoren spoke at the meeting. They all unanimously condemned the U.S. plot to use atomic weapons to massacre humanity.

Mao Dun spoke first. He pointed out that the United States not only cannot monopolize atomic weapons in the world today, but has also lost its advantage in atomic weapons. The Soviet Union not only uses atomic energy for power generation and mountain excavation for construction, but also possesses atomic weapons sufficient to defend against aggression. Now, the American imperialists' intimidation of the world's people with atomic weapons has not only failed to work, but has frightened themselves. He called on the literary and art circles to launch a struggle against the use of atomic weapons. He said: Our pens, our paintings, our music and dramas are all weapons. We must use these weapons to oppose the use of atomic weapons. Ding Ling said: Now there are the voices of imperialism and the voices of peace-loving people in the world. The peace-loving people will not allow the imperialists to use atomic weapons to kill people. If the American imperialists dare to use atomic weapons, they themselves will surely be wiped out. Lao She pointed out in his speech that now our literary and art workers are promoting socialist ideas, promoting the struggle for peace, and defending peace. Whether we are writers or painters, we must unite to oppose the use of atomic weapons so that atomic weapons cannot be used. The painter Qi Baishi, who was over ninety years old, attended the meeting with the help of others, leaning on a cane. He said, I have been painting for sixty or seventy years, painting beautiful and vibrant things. I want every grass and insect I paint to be full of vitality. Who can tolerate the destruction of a beautiful world! Finally, he said that he wanted to sign his name on the letter to the people of the world. Zhang Ruifang said: I am a drama and film actress. My acting career began at the same time as the War of Resistance Against Japan, and I grew up in the war. Seeing the fall of Japanese imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, we personally experienced our strength. I want to stand forever on the post of defending peace and be a loyal soldier. Zhou Weizhi said in his speech: We music workers oppose the use of atomic weapons to destroy our happy life. We will not only sign the declaration, but also use our songs to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan. We will use our songs to suppress the clamor of the war-mongers. Tian Han, Chen Qitong, Mei Lanfang and others also spoke at the meeting. The meeting finally called on literary and art workers across the country to participate in the struggle against the use of atomic weapons.

    首都文学艺术界人士举行签名大会
    【本报讯】十七日上午，首都文学艺术界举行反对使用原子武器签名大会，出席的有八百多人。会议由茅盾主持，在会上发言的有丁玲、梅兰芳、老舍、田汉、齐白石、陈其通、张瑞芳、周巍峙、史东山和吴作人等。他们都一致愤怒地申斥美国阴谋使用原子武器屠杀人类的罪行。
    茅盾首先发言。他指出，美国在世界上现在不但不能垄断原子武器，而且连原子武器的优势也失掉了。苏联不但用原子能发电，开山，用来建设，而且掌握了足可防御侵略的原子武器，现在美帝国主义用原子武器恐吓世界人民，不但没有生效，反倒恐吓了他自己。他号召文艺界展开反对使用原子武器的斗争。他说：我们的笔，我们的画，我们的音乐戏剧都是武器，我们要运用这些武器，反对使用原子武器。丁玲说：现在世界上有帝国主义的声音，有爱好和平人民的声音，爱好和平的人民不准帝国主义用原子武器杀人，假使美帝国主义敢用原子武器，被消灭的一定是他们自己。老舍在发言中指出，现在我们的文艺工作者是宣传社会主义思想，宣传争取和平，保卫和平；我们无论是写作的，画画的，都要团结起来，反对使用原子武器，使原子武器不能拿出来。九十多岁的画家齐白石，拄着拐杖，由人们搀着出席了大会，他说，我画了六七十年画，画的是好看的东西，有生气的东西，我画
  一个草虫都愿它生机活泼，谁又能容忍美好世界遭到破坏！最后，他说要把他的名字签在告全世界人民书上。张瑞芳说：我是一个话剧和电影演员。我的演员生活，是和抗日战争同时开始的，是在战争中成长起来的。眼看着日本帝国主义和蒋介石都倒下去了，我们亲身体验到了我们的力量。我要永远站在保卫和平事业的岗位上，作一个忠诚的士兵。周巍峙在发言中说：我们音乐工作者反对使用原子武器破坏我们的幸福生活，我们不但要在宣言上签名，我们还要用我们的歌声支援解放台湾的斗争，我们要用我们的歌声把战争贩子们的叫嚣压下去。田汉、陈其通、梅兰芳等也都在会上讲了话。会议最后号召全国文艺工作者参加反对使用原子武器的斗争。
