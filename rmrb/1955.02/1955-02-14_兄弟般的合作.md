    Fraternal Cooperation
    By D. Shepilov, Editor-in-Chief of "Pravda" (USSR)
    Five years have passed since that historic day in Moscow when the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance was signed. This greatest document of modern times was signed a few months after the great victory of the Chinese people's revolution, and is also one of the important achievements of this victory. After overthrowing the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the Chinese people resolutely joined the camp of peace and democracy and loudly declared their unwavering determination to strengthen friendly cooperation with the Soviet people. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty consolidated the friendship between the two great nations with legislative provisions. These two major nations are united by a common aspiration to fight side by side for peace, the happiness and prosperity of all peoples. The Sino-Soviet Treaty, based on the lofty spirit of proletarian internationalism, embodies the ideals of solidarity and sincere cooperation among the working people of all countries. The Sino-Soviet Treaty provides a vivid example of a new type of international relations to the world.
    Many "friendly" treaties also exist between capitalist countries. However, in these treaties, the word friendship is only used as a facade, beneath which lies fierce competition, with absolutely no sympathy for one's partners. Under these words are also hidden insatiable schemes to overwhelm "friends" and "allies." Friendship and alliance treaties between large and small, strong and weak capitalist countries are either "agreements" between a python and a rabbit, or "contracts" between tigers and wolves, ready to bite each other's throats at the first opportunity. When signing such treaties, imperialists do not think about helping their partners; their intention is only to ensure the highest profits.
    The relations between countries in the socialist camp are based on fundamentally different principles. The Sino-Soviet Treaty is a good example of this relationship. This treaty is built on such a solid foundation, namely, the sincere desire of the people of the Soviet Union and China to fully assist each other in promoting the economic and cultural progress of both countries.
    According to the treaty, the Soviet Union and People's China are obliged to conduct sincere cooperation in all international affairs, with the common goal of ensuring peace and security in the Far East and the world. The signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty has great international significance: two great countries with a population of 800 million are determined to jointly safeguard the cause of peace.
    Even before the signing of the treaty, our two peoples were linked by mutually friendly and comradely feelings that no enemy's conspiracy could shake. The Soviet people deeply sympathized with the heroic struggle of the Chinese people against the enslavers, praised their great courage and iron will, and firmly believed in the strength of their great neighbor, believing that they could free themselves from the shackles of long-term oppressors and seize the power to manage the country. This trust of the Soviet people in the incredible power of the Chinese people is based on the granite-like scientific foundation of the great theories of Lenin and Stalin. They had repeatedly predicted that anyone who did not see this power would suffer.
    The Sino-Soviet Treaty consolidated the sincere friendship between the two peoples. Comrade Mao Zedong emphasized the international significance of this treaty, saying: "People can see that the unity of the people of the two major countries, China and the Soviet Union, which has been solidified by the treaty, will be permanent, unbreakable, and no one can separate it. This unity will not only inevitably affect the prosperity of China and the Soviet Union, but also inevitably affect the future of mankind and the victory of peace and justice throughout the world."
    The agreements signed after the talks in Beijing during the visit of the Soviet government delegation headed by Comrades N.S. Khrushchev, N.A. Bulganin, A.I. Mikoyan, and N.M. Shvernik are of great significance in further consolidating the cause of Sino-Soviet friendship. The Soviet government and the government of the People's Republic of China issued a joint declaration, which emphasized that the views of the two countries are completely consistent.
    The situation in the past few years has fully and convincingly confirmed the truly good influence of the cooperation between the Soviet Union and China in economic development. This fraternal cooperation has helped and continues to help the two countries successfully solve a series of national economic problems.
    The Soviet people are very happy to provide a series of assistance to their friends and allies in carrying out large-scale tasks of national industrialization. The completion of these tasks is of great international significance, and the Soviet working people are also proud to feel that their experience in building socialism will be skillfully used by the Chinese working people and accelerate the speed of the Chinese people's advance on the socialist road. The economic development of New China is strengthening the power of the entire democratic and socialist camp.
    At the request of the government of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet government sent experts from various departments of industry and agriculture to China. They shared their experience with their Chinese friends like brothers and introduced the latest achievements of Soviet science and technology to Chinese comrades.
    While the Soviet Union helped People's China build factories and supply machinery and equipment, the People's Republic of China also provided assistance to the Soviet state: the Soviet Union imported a large number of tin, tungsten, molybdenum, jute, wool, raw silk, leather, soybeans, rice, vegetable oil, tea, and tangerines from China.
    Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation is of great significance. According to the agreement reached in the negotiations between the Soviet Union and China in October 1954, the Soviet Union helped China by supplying technical data for the construction of factories and the manufacture of machinery free of charge, as well as supplying scientific, technical and academic books. On the other hand, the People's Republic of China supplied the Soviet Union free of charge with information on the production technology of light industry, the pharmaceutical industry, and local industrial products, enabling Soviet experts to become familiar with the achievements and experiences of various national economic departments.
    Recently, the Soviet government suggested to the People's Republic of China, as well as other people's democratic countries, that it was willing to provide technical and production assistance to establish a scientific experimental base for the development and research of nuclear physics and the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. This suggestion is also a brilliant example of the Soviet Union's truly fraternal assistance.
    The Jining-Ulaanbaatar Railway and the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Almaty Railway have created favorable conditions for further expanding the close economic ties between the Soviet Union and China. These two railways are now being built rapidly.
    Many facts in the Soviet Union and China fully prove that mutual assistance and the sincere desire to achieve common economic upsurge are the foundation of Sino-Soviet cooperation and the foundation of mutual assistance among socialist camp countries.
    Cultural ties between the Soviet Union and China are consolidating and expanding year by year. The exchange of various delegations between the two countries has become a common occurrence in the lives of our two peoples. Film exhibitions and exhibitions are often held between the two countries, which enable each other to have a better understanding of the economic and cultural achievements of the fraternal countries. The publication of the Russian version of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" in large quantities in the Soviet Union is a major event in our social life. In Mao Zedong's works, we saw the further development of Marxism-Leninism and its skillful application under the specific conditions of China.
    The expansion of cultural ties enables the people of our two countries to better understand each other, brings us closer, and has a positive impact on the development of Soviet culture and the culture of People's China.
    The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China appear on the international stage as a united front. They cooperate closely and persistently defend the cause of peace and security for all countries. The foreign policies of our two countries are based on the Leninist principle of recognizing peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.
    The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China lead a powerful and rock-solid united camp of peace, democracy, and socialism. Sino-Soviet friendship is a model of cooperation among great powers in defending the cause of peace. This model inspires all those who are fighting for peace and security around the world.
    The fraternal friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China hinders the enemies of peace from carrying out their evil plans to incite a new destructive war. The people of all countries can see a reliable guarantee of peace in Sino-Soviet friendship.
    As everyone knows, the flames of the Korean War instigated by the American aggressors were extinguished due to the joint efforts of China and the Soviet Union. The attempts of the American military to obstruct the Korean armistice and expand the war went bankrupt. The struggle of the American diplomatic authorities at the Geneva Conference to obstruct the passage of the Indochina armistice was also futile. Thanks to the persistent efforts of the Soviet and Chinese delegations attending the Geneva Conference, an agreement on the Indochina armistice was reached, which was a major victory for the cause of peace.
    The joint declaration issued by the Soviet government and the government of the People's Republic of China on October 12, 1954, emphasized: "Experience has proved that the cooperation between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China has great vitality. This cooperation is a reliable guarantee of peace and security in the Far East and is an important factor in maintaining the cause of world peace."
    The Geneva Conference proved how significant a role the People's Republic of China, as a great peace-loving power, plays on the international stage. The influence of People's China on the development of the world's liberation movement has increased, and its international prestige has increased incomparably. The whole world is listening attentively to the statements of the representatives of the People's Republic of China at the Moscow Conference of European Countries on ensuring peace and security in Europe. The countries participating in this conference were satisfied to welcome the Chinese representatives' statement that the Chinese people not only care about peace in Asia, but also care about peace in Europe.
    At present, all sober politicians recognize the high international prestige of New China. Only the American ruling group, which is madly hateful of the people who shattered the shackles of slavery and powerlessness, is unwilling to face the reality formed in the Far East due to the victory of the Chinese people. Until now, this ruling group stubbornly opposes the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations.
    The American ruling group is interfering in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China, which is clearing out the Chiang Kai-shek bandits from the coastal islands. In addition, they are not only undermining the legitimate historical rights of the People's Republic of China in recovering all Chinese territories, but also openly trampling on the international agreements on the Taiwan issue, which were also signed by American representatives.
    Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, not to mention other coastal islands close to China, are all integral parts of Chinese territory. Liberating these islands is the sovereignty of the Chinese people. The American masters of lies and rumors who argue the opposite are very much like the snake in the Chinese proverb: even if you drive it into a bamboo tube, it will still coil around a few times. This is exactly how American and British diplomats, overwhelmed by ironclad facts, cleverly circumvent them.
    Recently, the United States has intensified its aggressive actions against China in the Taiwan region. These actions are the root cause of the sharpening of the situation in the Far East. The purpose of the United States is obvious. Under the pretext of protecting the despised Chiang Kai-shek clique trapped in Taiwan, American imperialism attempts to seize the island from China and turn it into a base for new provocations in the Far East.
    Of course, the hostile actions of the United States have aroused great indignation among the Chinese people, who are trying to recover all their territories and eliminate the causes of tension in the Far East. The feelings of the Chinese people who are engaged in liberating Taiwan have the full sympathy of the Soviet people and all peace-loving people in all countries.
    The Soviet Union, as a loyal friend and ally of China, fully supports the policies of the Chinese People's Government on the issue of liberating Taiwan. The heroic Chinese people can count on the help of their loyal friend, the great Soviet people, in the noble cause of defending their honor and independence.
    In the fraternal cooperation between our two powerful countries lies the power to shatter the schemes of any warmongers.
    The Soviet Union and China possess unlimited manpower and inexhaustible natural resources. In the underground of our two countries, there are huge amounts of coal, oil, iron ore, various non-ferrous metals, and uranium ore deposits. There are almost no resources that cannot be found under the fertile lands of our two countries. We have all the necessary conditions to achieve full economic prosperity and further strengthen our power and defense capabilities.
    The science and culture of our two peoples are great forces. Their common characteristic is that our best scientists and cultural workers are always engaged in selfless struggle to realize the aspirations of ordinary working people in urban and rural areas and their long-cherished desire for a free and happy life. The Soviet and Chinese people are both peace-loving people who have gone through a difficult struggle for happiness.
    It is not easy for the people of our two countries to be able to work peacefully and create their own happiness with their own hands. Precisely because of this, they value their freedom and cherish peace. Precisely because of this, they are constantly strengthening the national defense of their countries. If aggressors dare to disrupt the peaceful labor of the two great free peoples, they will resolutely stand up to defend their homes, their motherland, and crush the enemy. There can only be one outcome of such a conflict: the death of the aggressor. Those who try to intimidate our two great nations should remember this.
    The enemies of peace hope to see disunity between our two great nations. They spare no effort to carry out splitting activities in our united ranks and divide our fraternal alliance. These efforts are insignificant; they will be defeated! Their chances of success are less than the chances of an ant trying to shake a strong and sturdy oak tree.
    The Soviet and Chinese people are united like a rock. Common ideas and common goals with deep roots connect us. Sino-Soviet friendship, a strong fortress of peace, possesses a powerful and amazing force. The Soviet Union and China, as well as peace-loving people all over the world, are united into an invincible camp. They are moving forward confidently along the road of building a happy and joyful life. Their strength is growing, and the close cooperation between the two great nations, the Soviet Union and China, makes them more optimistic. Today, as the Soviet and Chinese people celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, they jointly declare: "May the friendship between the two great nations, the Soviet Union and China, be increasingly consolidated and prosper!"

    兄弟般的合作
    苏联“真理报”总编辑  德·谢皮洛夫
    自从在莫斯科签订苏中友好同盟互助条约那个历史性的日子以来，已经五年了。这个现代最伟大的文件是在中国人民革命取得伟大的胜利以后几个月签订的，并且也是这个胜利的重要成果之一。中国人民在推翻了蒋介石卖国集团之后，就坚决地参加了和平民主阵营，并响亮地宣布自己的加强和苏联人民友好合作的坚定不移的决心。苏中条约的签订，以立法条文巩固了两个伟大民族的友谊，这两大民族是由并肩携手地为和平、各国人民的幸福和繁荣而斗争的共同愿望结合在一起的。这个条约以崇高的无产阶级国际主义精神为主，体现了劳动人民的各国人民团结和真诚合作的理想。苏中条约向全世界提供了新型的国际关系的生动榜样。
    在资本主义国家之间也存在着许多“友好”的条约。但是在这些条约里，友谊的字样只是装饰门面用的，在这些字眼下面掩盖着剧烈的竞争，在这种竞争里，根本谈不上对自己伙伴的任何怜悯，在这些字眼下还隐藏着压倒“朋友”和“同盟者”的贪得无厌的计谋。资本主义的大国和小国、强国和弱国间的友好和同盟条约，不是大蟒和兔子之间的“协议”，就是虎狼之间的“契约”，它们准备一有机会就马上咬断对方的咽喉。在签订这种条约时，帝国主义者也没有想到要帮助自己的伙伴，他们的企图只是想保证获取最高的利润。
    社会主义阵营各国之间的关系，则是建立在根本不同的另一种原则之上的。苏中条约就是这种关系的一个良好榜样。这个条约是建立在这样的巩固基础之上，即建立在苏中两国人民全力互助以促进两国经济和文化的进步这一真诚愿望之上的。
    根据条约，苏联和人民中国有义务在一切国际事务中进行真诚的合作，其共同目的是保证远东和全世界的和平和安全。苏中条约的签订，具有重大的国际意义：八亿人口的两个大国决心共同维护和平事业。
    在条约签订之前，我们两国人民就已被任何敌人的阴谋都动摇不了的、相互友好的和同志的感情联系起来了。苏联人民对于中国人民反对奴役者的英勇斗争寄予深切的同情，赞扬他们的高度勇敢和钢铁意志，坚决相信自己伟大邻国的强大力量，相信他们能摆脱长期压迫者的束缚并取得掌管国家的权力，苏维埃人对于中国人民的不可思议的力量的这种信任，是建立在列宁、斯大林的伟大学说的花岗石般的科学基础之上的。他们曾经屡次预言：谁要是看不到这种力量，谁就一定要吃苦头。
    苏中条约巩固了两国人民的真诚友谊。毛泽东同志曾强调指出这个条约的国际意义，他说：“人们可以看得见：业已经过条约固定下来的中苏两大国人民的团结将是永久的，不可破坏的，没有人能够分离的。而这种团结，不但必然要影响中苏两大国的繁荣，而且必然要影响到人类的将来，影响到全世界和平与正义的胜利。”
    以尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫、尼·亚·布尔加宁、阿·伊·米高扬和尼·米·什维尔尼克同志为首的苏联政府代表团访问中国时在北京会谈后签订的协定，在进一步巩固苏中友谊的事业中，具有巨大的意义。苏联政府和中华人民共和国政府发表了联合宣言，宣言中强调指出两国的观点是完全一致的。
    过去几年的情况，使人完全信服地证实了苏中两国在经济发展上的合作的真正良好的影响。这种兄弟般的合作帮助过、现在仍然帮助着两国来顺利解决一系列的国民经济问题。
    苏联人民很高兴在自己的朋友和同盟者执行国家工业化的大规模任务中给予一系列的帮助。这些任务的完成具有巨大的国际意义，而苏联劳动人民也自豪地感到，他们建设社会主义的经验将会为中国劳动人民所巧妙地运用，并加快中国人民在社会主义道路上前进的速度。新中国的经济发展正在加强整个民主和社会主义阵营的威力。
    苏联政府根据中华人民共和国政府的请求，派了工农业各部门的专家到中国来，他们像兄弟般地把自己的经验告诉中国朋友，向中国同志介绍苏联科学和技术的最新成就。
    在苏联帮助人民中国建设工厂、供给机器和设备的同时，中华人民共和国也给苏维埃国家以帮助：苏联从中国进口了为数众多的锡、钨、钼、黄麻、毛、生丝、皮革、黄豆、大米、植物油、茶叶、橘柑。
    苏中科学技术合作具有重大的意义。按照苏中两国一九五四年十月谈判所取得的协议，苏联用无代价供应建设工厂和制造机器方面的技术资料以及供给科学技术和学术书籍的方法来帮助中国，另一方面，则由中华人民共和国无代价地供给苏联以轻工业、制药工业和地方工业产品生产技术的情报，使苏联专家有可能熟悉各个国民经济部门的成就和经验。
    最近苏联政府向中华人民共和国，同时也向其他人民民主国家建议，愿意提供技术上和生产上的援助，为发展和研究核子物理学和把原子能用于和平目的，建立科学实验基础。这一建议也是苏联的真正兄弟般的援助的光辉的榜样。
    集宁—乌兰巴托铁路和兰州—乌鲁木齐—阿拉木图铁路为进一步扩大苏中经济上的密切联系创造了有利的条件。这两条铁路现在正在迅速地建筑着。
    苏联和中国的许多事实都充分地证明，互相帮助和达到共同的经济高涨的真诚愿望是苏中合作的基础，也是社会主义阵营各国互助的基础。
    苏联和中国的文化联系在逐年地巩固和扩大。两国之间互派各种代表团访问，已经成为我们两国人民生活中习见的事。两国间经常举办电影展览和展览会，这使彼此对兄弟国家经济和文化方面的成就有了更好的了解。中国作家和科学家的著作在苏联大量地出版。“毛泽东选集”俄文版的问世，是我国社会生活中的一件大事。我们在毛泽东的著作中看到了马克思列宁主义学说的进一步发展，和它在中国的具体条件下的巧妙的运用。
    文化联系的扩展使我们两国人民能够更好地互相了解，使我们更加接近，并对苏联文化和人民中国文化的发展发生了良好的影响。
    苏联和中华人民共和国作为统一战线出现在国际舞台上，它们密切合作，坚持不懈地捍卫各国人民和平和安全的事业。我们两国的外交政策，都是以承认社会制度不同的国家和平共处和不干涉他国内政这一列宁原则为出发点的。
      苏联和中华人民共和国领导着强大的、磐石般团结一致的和平、民主、社会主义阵营。苏中友好是捍卫和平事业的大国合作的范例。这一范例鼓舞着所有为争取全世界和平和安全而斗争的人们。
    苏联和中华人民共和国的兄弟般友谊阻碍了和平的敌人实行它们煽动新的毁灭性战争的罪恶计划。各国人民在苏中友谊中可以看到保卫和平的可靠保证。
    大家知道，美国侵略者煽动起来的朝鲜战火，由于中国和苏联的共同努力而熄灭了。美国军人阻碍朝鲜停战、扩大战争的企图遭到了破产。美国外交当局在日内瓦会议上阻挠通过印度支那停战的挣扎也是徒然的。由于出席日内瓦会议的苏联和中华人民共和国代表团的坚持不渝的努力，达成了关于印度支那停战的协议，这是和平事业的重大胜利。
    苏联政府和中华人民共和国政府在一九五四年十月十二日发表的联合宣言中强调指出：“经验证明，苏联和中华人民共和国的合作是具有伟大生命力的，这种合作是远东和平和安全的可靠保证，是维护世界和平事业的重要因素。”
    日内瓦会议证明，中华人民共和国作为一个伟大的爱好和平的大国在国际舞台上起着多么重大的作用。人民中国对全世界解放运动的发展的影响提高了，它的国际威望无可比拟地增加了。全世界都在注意地倾听在讨论保障欧洲和平和安全的欧洲国家莫斯科会议上中华人民共和国代表的发言。参加这次会议的各国满意地欢迎了中国代表所作的中国人民不仅关怀亚洲和平，而且也关怀欧洲和平的声明。
    目前所有清醒的政治家们都承认新中国的高度国际威望，只有疯狂憎恨那些粉碎了奴隶枷锁和无权地位的人民的美国统治集团，才不愿正视因中国人民胜利在远东形成的实际情况，直到现在这个统治集团仍顽固地反对在联合国内恢复中国的合法权利。
    美国统治集团对于正在从沿海岛屿上肃清蒋介石匪帮的中华人民共和国进行内政干涉，此外，他们不仅破坏中华人民共和国在收复所有中国领土方面的合法历史权利，而且还公开践踏了也有美国代表签字的关于台湾问题的国际协定。
    台湾、澎湖列岛，其他靠近中国的沿海岛屿更不用说，都是中国领土的不可分割的部分，解放这些岛屿是中国人民的主权。作相反论调的美国的说谎和造谣大师们很像中国谚语中的蛇，你就是把它赶入竹筒里，它也要盘绕上几遭。为铁的事实所压倒的美、英外交家们正是这样地来巧妙规避的。
    最近，美国在台湾地区对中国的侵略行动特别加紧起来。这些行动就是造成远东局势尖锐化的根本原因。美国的目的很明显。美帝国主义以保护困守在台湾的被唾弃的蒋介石集团为借口，企图从中国手中夺取这个岛屿，并使它变成在远东进行新挑衅的基地。
    当然，美国的敌对行动引起了企图收复自己的所有领土并消除远东局势紧张原因的中国人民的极大愤慨。从事解放台湾的中国人民的感情完全得到苏联人民和所有爱好和平的各国人民的同情。
    苏联作为中国的忠实朋友和盟友，在解放台湾的问题上全力支持中国人民政府的政策。英勇的中国人民在保卫自己的荣誉和独立的崇高事业中可以指望获得他们的忠实朋友——伟大的苏联人民的帮助。
    在我们两个强大国家的亲如兄弟的合作中就蕴藏有能粉碎任何战争贩子的诡计的力量。
    苏联和中国拥有无限的人力和取之不尽的天然富源。在我们两国的地下蕴藏着巨量的煤、石油、铁矿砂、各种有色金属和铀矿砂的矿层。在我们两国的富饶的土地下几乎没有哪一种富源会找不出来。我们拥有获得充分的经济繁荣和进一步加强我们的威力和国防力量的一切必要的条件。
    我们两国人民的科学和文化就是伟大的力量。它们的总特点就是：我们的最优秀的科学家和文化工作者永远在进行着忘我的斗争，以实现城乡的普通劳动人民的愿望和他们对自由和幸福生活的宿愿。苏联和中国人民都是爱好劳动的人民，都是经历过一段为争取幸福而进行的艰巨斗争的道路的。
    对于我们两国人民来说，能够和平地劳动，能够用自己的手创造自己的幸福，这是不容易的。正因为如此，他们才重视自己的自由，珍爱和平。正因为如此，他们才不断地巩固他们国家的国防。如果侵略分子胆敢破坏两大自由人民的和平劳动，他们会坚决地挺起身来保卫他们的家园、他们的祖国，并且把敌人粉碎。这种冲突的结局只能有一个：侵略者的死亡。企图恫吓我们两大民族的人，不妨记住这点。
    和平的敌人希望看到我们两大民族的不团结，他们不惜力量来在我们团结的队伍中进行分裂活动，分裂我们兄弟般的联盟。这些努力是渺小的；会遭到失败的！他们成功的机会比蚂蚁企图摇晃强大而牢固的橡树的成功机会更少。
    苏联和中国人民像磐石一样地团结在一起。有深固根源的共同思想和共同目的把我们连接起来。苏中友谊、强大的和平堡垒拥有强大的惊人的力量。苏联和中国以及全世界爱好和平的人民团结成一个不可战胜的阵营。他们满怀信心地在沿着建设幸福愉快的生活道路前进。他们的力量是在增长着，苏联和中国两大民族的亲密的合作使他们更加乐观。苏联和中国人民当今天在庆祝友好同盟互助条约签订五周年的时候，共同宣称：“愿苏联和中国两大民族的友谊日益巩固和繁荣！”
