    A Bathroom That Failed the Expectations of Six Thousand People

    In the second and third residential areas of the Ministry of Railways outside Fuxingmen in the western suburbs of Beijing, about 1,300 to 1,400 households of railway workers reside, totaling about six thousand people, including men, women, the elderly, and children. Recently, ten readers, including Wang Shifa, wrote letters reflecting that the bathing problem of the residents in these two residential areas has not been resolved for a long time.

    According to comrades from the family committee of the second residential area, it is quite far from the urban area, so people have to go to Xidan, which is five miles away, to take a bath. Many women, because they have many children and are busy with housework, cannot travel that far, and some have not bathed for half a year. The situation in the third residential area is the same. The family committee has repeatedly reported the demands of the masses to the relevant departments, but there has been no response.

    Is it that the demands of the residents are too high and cannot be resolved at present? Not at all. When the second residential area was built in the spring of 1953, there were bathing facilities, two bathrooms for men and women, each with fifty shower "rose heads." As long as the bathrooms are opened and the residents pay for bathing without increasing any public expenditure, the needs of the masses can be met. Unfortunately, for more than a year, the sanitary facilities built by the state to care for the people's health have not been utilized. Now, the door of the boiler room is broken, some glass windows in the bathrooms and changing rooms have been broken, and many of the shower water pipes have also been damaged.

    Originally, at the beginning, the bathroom was used as a dormitory and canteen for the employees by the construction unit of the dormitory—the First Engineering Office of the Railway Ministry's Construction Plant Engineering Company. For this problem, the responsible comrades of the Trade Union of the Ministry of Railways had talked to the director of the General Affairs Department, the director of the Employee Living Supply Bureau, and the director of the Directly Subordinate Supply Section no less than dozens of times. The operation and management of the bathroom was originally the work of the supply department, but the supply department believed it was the responsibility of the general affairs department, pushing it back and forth, and no one took care of it. The shower heads in the bathroom are still full of beds for employees of the construction unit.

    The residents' opinions were constantly put forward. The trade union wrote an official letter to the director of the general office of the ministry in August. In October, the industrial section took back the bathroom building from the construction unit. Soon after, the supply department also agreed to operate the bathroom and made a budget to ask the general affairs department to repair the building and purchase equipment. At this point, it seemed that the problem could be solved quickly. However, from November last year to the present, the bathroom has neither been opened nor repaired. Originally, the supply section's budget proposed to install heating in the bathroom, but the general affairs department believed that a simple bathroom did not need to install heating. Until now, the heating problem has not been resolved.

    I believe that if the leaders pay due attention and care to the reasonable and easily resolved living welfare demands of the broad masses, then the bathroom problems of the second and third residential areas should have been resolved long ago.　Xiǎo Yuán

    一个辜负了六千人期望的浴室
    在北京市西郊复兴门外的铁道部第二、第三两个住宅区，居住着一千三、四百户铁路职工，男女老少共约六千人。最近，王世发等十位读者来信反映：这两个住宅区的住户，洗澡问题长期得不到解决。
    据第二住宅区家属委员会的同志们说：这儿离市区较远，人们要洗澡就得到五里以外的西单去；不少妇女因为孩子多，家务忙，不能跑那么远的路，半年不洗澡的也有。第三住宅区的情况也一样。家属委员会曾经多次向有关方面反映群众的要求，但是一直没有下文。
    是不是住户们提出的要求过高了，而目前无法解决呢？完全不是。第二住宅区在一九五三年春季修起来的时候，就有了沐浴设备，男女两个浴室，各有五十个淋浴的“莲蓬头”。只要把浴室开办起来，由住户们付费洗澡不用公家增加什么开支，就可以满足群众的要求。可惜的是，一年多来，国家为了关怀人民健康而修建的卫生设施一直没被利用。现在，锅炉房的门已经破了，浴室和更衣室的有些玻璃窗已经打碎了，淋浴的水管也搞坏了不少。
    原来，在开始的时候，浴室被宿舍的施工单位——铁道部建厂工程公司第一工程处用作职工宿舍和食堂。为了这个问题，铁道部机关工会负责同志找过总务处处长、职工生活供应局局长和直属供应段段长，先后谈了不下数十次。浴室的经营管理本来是供应部门的工作，但是供应部门却认为是总务部门的责任，推来推去谁也不管。浴室的莲蓬头下面还是满摆着施工单位的职工床铺。
    住户们的意见不断地提出来。工会在八月份写公函给部里的办公厅主任。十月间产业科从施工单位那里收回了浴室的房屋。不久后，供应部门也同意经营这个浴室，并且做出预算请总务处整修房屋和购置设备。到这时，似乎问题很快就可以解决了。但是，从去年十一月一直拖到现在，浴室既没有开办，也没有整修。原来，供应段的预算中提出要在浴室安装暖气，但总务处认为一个简单的浴室不用安装暖气。直到现在，暖气问题还没有得到解决。
    我认为领导方面，如果对于广大群众的合理而易于解决的生活福利上的要求，给以应有的注意和关怀，那么，第二、第三住宅区的浴室，早就应该解决了。　晓园
