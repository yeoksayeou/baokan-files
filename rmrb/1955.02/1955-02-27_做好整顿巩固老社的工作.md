Do a Good Job of Rectifying and Consolidating Old Cooperatives
Gao Changren

The Xiangyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of key members from thirty-five old cooperatives in late December of last year. At this meeting, many serious problems within these old cooperatives were revealed.

I. Chaotic Financial Management, Significant Deficits Within the Cooperatives

(1) Unclear work point records, accounting errors, discrepancies in income and expenditure. According to preliminary statistics from these thirty-five old cooperatives, there were 4.85 million yuan in erroneous payments, 995 catties of grain in errors, and 1,230 incorrect work points. The "Yujian" cooperative had 600,000 yuan on its books, but the money could not be found. Gao Gongyi, the head of the "Yuanda" cooperative, would buy things and have others record them on cigarette boxes, without promptly reporting them. He lost two cigarette boxes and to this day, it is unknown how much was recorded on them. (2) Cooperative cadres did not abide by financial regulations, privately misappropriating public funds, engaging in embezzlement and waste. There were 1.16 million yuan in funds for which no receipts could be found at all. Xie Xiangbin, the head of the "Xiangfeng" cooperative in Longwangmiao, misappropriated 2 million yuan alone. (3) Reckless squandering under the direction of cooperative cadres. The head of the "Xiangfeng" cooperative spent more than 3 million yuan to sew more than 30 sets of clothes for cooperative members, claiming this was "relying on the poor and landless peasants"; he spent 11 million yuan to build 14 rooms. The "Xiangzhen" cooperative spent cooperative funds to uniformly buy one bolt of white cloth, one bolt of blue cloth, 12.7 yards of printed cloth, 48 towels, three dozen socks, and two buckets of kerosene; they borrowed more than 2 million yuan from the credit cooperative and spent more than 1 million yuan on this alone. Two cooperative member households still owe the cooperative more than 2 million yuan. Feng Chengyang, the head of the "Yongjiu" cooperative, arbitrarily used the 670,000 yuan the cooperative earned from selling cotton to buy unnecessary items; in addition to using some for himself, he also lent 250,000 yuan to his father-in-law. Cooperative members said, "We joined the cooperative to help you cast your net."

II. Many Unresolved Distribution Issues, Serious Violations of Distribution Policies

These thirty-five old cooperatives had many ways of distributing profits: (1) Simply distributing according to population. For example, the central cooperative in Zhangwan Township distributed grain based on population, regardless of adults or children. (2) The "Hongqi" cooperative initially distributed based on self-reported needs, then distributed equally by household for the second distribution, and equally by labor power for the third distribution, claiming this was "taking care of all three aspects." (3) Twenty of the thirty-five cooperatives present at the meeting distributed grain by population and compensated with cash crops. Two cooperatives distributed entirely according to labor power, and eleven cooperatives distributed according to labor power and land. (4) One cooperative deducted all the prices that should be shared from the cooperative shares of cattle and farm implements in the distribution; some cooperative members could not afford it, and some cooperative members received no grain and even had to take money out of pocket. (5) The "Zhiyuan" cooperative stipulated that sweet potatoes be divided for each household to dig themselves; in the end, more than 20 mu of sweet potatoes belonging to cooperative members lacking labor power were not dug, and it was delayed until it snowed. The head of the cooperative said, "Whoever digs them gets them," and as a result, those with labor power grabbed all of the sweet potatoes from the 20 mu. (6) In one cooperative, firewood was taken by whoever burned it, without keeping records, and it was stipulated that it could be borrowed for building houses as needed, without charge for amounts under 500 catties. As a result, cooperative members who did not need to build houses also said they wanted to build houses, and everyone stole or took firewood, quickly depleting it.

In addition, some cooperative members borrowed or demanded things arbitrarily. A total of 123 households in the thirty-five cooperatives overspent, overspending a total of 24.06 million yuan in cash and 1,344 catties of grain.

The thirty-five cooperatives had 44.7 million yuan in undistributed funds, more than 27,000 catties of seed cotton, 990 catties of sesame, 1,140 catties of sorghum, 4,150 catties of millet, more than 17,000 catties of buckwheat, and more than 22,000 catties of other miscellaneous grains. These grains and funds were long-term accumulated in the cooperatives.

III. Disorganized Production Management, Causing Serious Losses

(1) Draft cattle were not cared for by dedicated personnel, resulting in serious mortality. Of the 436 draft cattle in the thirty-five cooperatives, 38 had died, 84 had become so thin they could not work, and 13 were so thin they had to be carried by people. People outside the cooperative sarcastically said, "The cooperative is so superior, the cattle are so thin they have to be carried." The "Yuanda" cooperative did not have dedicated personnel to feed the cattle and used a lottery method for rotation, but no one wanted to feed them when it was their turn. The "Zhiyuan" cooperative had two cattle that were so thin they could not walk, and the management committee proposed "slaughtering them for a meal to improve living standards"; after the cattle were slaughtered, cooperative members quarreled over the distribution of the meat. The head of the cooperative said, "I'm so angry, and they're still arguing about eating the beef liver." The "Guangming" cooperative lost four cattle and one mule; the causes of death were: one starved to death, one froze to death, one worked to death, and one died of illness.

(2) Farm implements were discarded randomly, damaging many, without dedicated personnel responsible. The thirty-five cooperatives damaged the following farm implements: 29 plows, 9 harrows, 22 carts, and 25 other medium-sized farm implements. All three carts in the "Yongjiu" cooperative were unusable; one harrow was left in the field for half a month without anyone taking it back.

These problems had existed for a long time, causing numerous opinions within the cooperatives, mutual blaming, passive slowdowns, and production plans becoming mere formality. The number of people requesting withdrawal from the cooperatives was increasing daily, cooperative cadres lost confidence, and it created a very bad influence among the people outside the cooperatives. One old cooperative member reflected that since the establishment of the cooperative, he had done "confused work," received "confused accounts," and eaten "confused meals," which they called "three confusions." A member of the "Yuanda" cooperative said, "Even if we were just old hands (long-term workers), we should still get a settlement now!" When the "Shengli" cooperative assigned work, cooperative members went to the mountains to cut firewood themselves; the head of the cooperative was so anxious that he stopped two children on the road to go to work. When planting wheat in the "Tiepan" cooperative, no one went when people were assigned to plow the land, and no one went to get the wheat seeds that had been purchased; as a result, 20 mu of land were left unplanted. In the "Yongjiu" cooperative, 80 percent of the seedlings were missing in two mu of wheat fields, and no one went to replant; about ten mu of land were vacant at the edges and ends of the fields, and no one went to cultivate them. Cooperative members' thoughts were: "It's sure to break up sooner or later." According to the thirty-five cooperatives, seven households had already withdrawn from the cooperatives, and eleven households were firmly requesting withdrawal; some cooperative members, while not directly requesting withdrawal, were requesting to retain more private plots.

The Xiangyang County Committee believes that the main reasons for these serious problems in the old cooperatives are that the leadership has not grasped the laws of cooperative development, and there is also a serious bureaucratic work style, neglecting leadership of the old cooperatives.

Now all problems are concentrated on carrying out distribution settlements and improving the financial system. The County Committee believes: "Clarifying accounts and resolving problems" is not only the urgent demand of current cooperative members and cadres, but also the key to consolidating the cooperative.

At this meeting, the County Committee put forward four opinions on rectifying and consolidating the old cooperatives:

I. Rely on the branch, starting with summarizing achievements, clarifying thinking, identifying problems, and improving the ideological level and working ability of key members.

II. On the basis of carrying out inspection, summary, and distribution settlements, and after democratic discussion, formulate specific measures for feeding cattle and managing farm implements, and improve business management.

III. Combine the handling of specific issues to improve the leadership of the management committee and strictly enforce the financial system.

IV. Summarize production management, find loopholes in production; improve cooperative members' collectivist consciousness by calculating loss accounts; on this basis, further discuss and revise the cooperative's agricultural and sideline production plans, and mobilize cooperative members to launch labor competitions.

This is what the five cooperatives in Hupai Township, Xiangyang County, did. They conducted distribution settlements, resolved unreasonable distribution problems, summarized production achievements, mobilized households to calculate accounts and compare them, and conducted re-education on love for the cooperative, love for labor, and the general line; they also summarized one year of production management and identified ways to improve. After doing this, the cooperative members felt enlightened, and a new atmosphere appeared in the cooperative's production. Some cooperatives that have not done this still have a scattered production mood and confused thoughts among the cooperative members.

The Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that the serious problems found in the old cooperatives in Xiangyang County exist throughout the Xiangyang area. In its instructions on December 31 of last year, the Prefectural Committee said: If the problems of the more than 800 cooperatives established throughout the region in the winter of 1953 and spring of 1954 cannot be thoroughly and deeply uncovered and completely resolved, the old cooperatives will inevitably lose their banner role; not only will the old cooperatives not be run well, but it will also create great obstacles to the development of the entire mutual aid and cooperation movement. The instructions pointed out that the guiding ideology of only focusing on running new cooperatives and relaxing the consolidation of old cooperatives must be immediately corrected, and the mistaken understanding that there is a contradiction between consolidating old cooperatives and developing new cooperatives must be overcome.

    做好整顿巩固老社的工作
    高长任
    中共襄阳县委在去年十二月下旬召开了三十五个老社的骨干分子会议。在这次会议上，反映出这些老社有很多严重的问题。
    一、财务管理混乱，社内亏空很大
    （1）工分记载不清，错账，错款，收支不符，据这三十五个老社的初步统计，错款四百八十五万元，错粮九百九十五斤，错工分一千二百三十分。“裕建”社账上有六十万元的一笔款，但找不到钱在那里。“远大”社社长高公义买东西请别人记在纸烟盒子上，也不及时报账。他丢了两个纸烟盒，至今也不知上面记了多少款。（2）社干部不遵守财务制度，私自挪用公款，贪污浪费，完全找不到条据的有一百一十六万元。龙王庙“襄风”社社长谢祥斌一人就挪用公款二百万元。（3）在社干部主持下任意挥霍。“襄风”社社长拿三百多万元给社员缝衣服三十多套，说这是“依靠贫雇”；盖房十四间，花了一千一百万元。“向真”社由社出钱统一买了一匹白市布、一匹蓝布、十二丈七尺花布、四十八条毛巾、三打袜子、两桶煤油；他们向信用社贷款二百多万元，仅此就花掉了一百多万元。有两户社员，至今还欠社里二百多万元。“永久”社社长冯成扬把社里卖棉花的六十七万元，随意买不需要的东西；除自己私用外，还借给他老丈人二十五万元。社员说：“我们入社是给你们赶网的。”
    二、分配遗留问题很多，严重违反
        分配政策
    这三十五个老社分配的花样很多：（1）单纯按人口分。如张湾乡中心社的分法是不论大人小孩，按人头分粮。（2）“红旗”社第一次是自报需要，按需要分配，第二次按户平分，第三次按劳力平分，说这是“三方面照顾”。（3）粮食按人分，以经济作物找补。到会三十五个社按这样分配的有二十个社，全部按劳力分配的有两个社，按劳力、土地分配的有十一个社。（4）有一个社在分配中把耕牛、农具入社应摊的价款一齐扣清；部分社员拿不起，有的社员连一点粮食分不到还需要向外拿钱。（5）“支援”社规定红薯分给各户自挖；最后剩下二十多亩缺劳力的社员的红薯没有人挖，拖延到下雪了，社长说：“谁挖归谁”，结果有劳力的把这二十亩红薯一抢而光。（6）有一个社的柴草，谁烧谁拿，不记账，并规定盖房子可以根据需要借用，五百斤以下的不要钱。结果，不需要盖房的社员也说要盖房，大家把柴草偷的偷，要的要，一下子挑完了。
    此外，有些社员乱借、强要，三十五个社计有一百二十三户社员超支，共超支了现金二千四百零六万元，超支粮食一千三百四十四斤。
    三十五个社没有分配的款有四千四百七十万元，籽棉二万七千多斤，芝麻九百九十斤，高粱一千一百四十斤，粟谷四千一百五十斤，荞麦一万七千多斤，其他杂粮二万二千斤。这些粮、款长期积压在社里。
    三、生产管理紊乱，造成严重损失
    （1）耕牛没有专人负责喂养，死亡现象严重。三十五个社的四百三十六条耕牛，已死亡三十八头，喂瘦了不能干活的有八十四头，瘦得不能动要人抬的有十三头。社外群众讽刺说：“合作社真优越，牛瘦有人抬。”“远大”社没有专人喂牛，用拈阄办法轮流喂养，轮着谁谁也不愿喂。“支援”社有两头牛瘦得不能走，管理委员会提出“杀了加餐，改善生活”；把牛杀了，社员为分肉吵嘴。社长说：“老子气死了，他们还吵着要吃牛肝。”“光明”社死了四头牛、一个骡子；致死原因是：饿死一头，冻死一头，累死一头，病死一头。
      （2）农具乱甩，损坏了许多，没专人负责。三十五个社损坏的农具计有：犁二十九张，耙九盘，大车二十二乘，其他中型农具二十五件。“永久”社三乘大车都不能用了；有一盘耙放在地里，半个月没人拿回。
    这些问题长期存在，社内意见纷纷，互相埋怨，消极怠工，生产计划流于形式主义，要求退社的人日渐增多，社干部丧失了信心，在社外群众中造成了极坏的影响。有一个老社社员反映：建社以来，他做的“糊涂工”，分的“糊涂账”，吃的
  “糊涂饭”，他们称之为“三糊涂”。“远大”社社员说：“我们就是当个老伙计（长工），现在也该给结个账吧！”“胜利”社社里派了工，社员却都到山上去自己砍柴；社长急得没法，在路上拦住两个小孩去干活。“铁盘”社种麦子时，派人犁地没人去，买了麦种没人去拿；结果，二十亩地就空着没种。“永久”社的二亩麦地缺苗百分之八十，也没人去补；地边、地头空了大约十亩面积，也没人去挖。社员思想是：“迟早准是散伙。”据三十五个社了解，已退出社的社员有七户，坚决要求退社的有十一户；有一部分社员虽没直接提出退社，却要求多留自留地。
    襄阳县委认为：老社存在这些严重问题的主要原因，是领导方面掌握不住社的发展规律，又有严重的官僚主义作风，忽视了对老社的领导。
    现在一切问题都集中在进行分配决算、健全财务制度上。县委认为：“弄清账目，解决问题”，不仅是当前社员和社干部的迫切要求，而且是巩固社的关键。
    在这个会议上，县委提出了整顿巩固老社的四条意见：
    一、依靠支部，从总结成绩入手，弄通思想，摸清问题，提高骨干的思想水平和工作能力。
    二、在进行了检查总结分配决算的基础上，经过民主讨论，制定耕牛喂养和农具保管的具体办法，改进经营管理工作。
    三、结合处理具体问题，健全和改进管理委员会的领导，严格财务制度。
    四、总结生产管理工作，找生产上的漏洞；通过算损失账，提高社员的集体主义觉悟；在这基础上，进一步讨论修订全社农业副业生产计划，发动社员开展劳动竞赛。
    襄阳县伙牌乡的五个社就是这样做的。他们进行了分配决算，解决了分配不合理的问题，总结了生产成绩，发动户户算账对比，进行了爱社、爱劳动和总路线的再教育；他们还总结了一年的生产经营管理工作，找出了改进的办法。这样做了以后，社员们心里亮堂了，社里的生产也出现了新气象。还没有这样做的一些社，生产情绪仍然是涣散的，社员思想仍然是混乱的。
    中共襄阳地委认为：襄阳县发现的老社存在的严重的问题，在襄阳地区各地都有。地委在去年十二月三十一日的批示中说：一九五三年冬一九五四年春全区建立的八百多个社的问题如果不能又深又透地挖出来，彻底地加以解决，老社必将失去旗帜作用；不但老社办不好，而且会给整个互助合作运动的开展造成很大的障碍。批示中指出：只顾办新社而放松巩固老社的指导思想必须立即纠正，认为巩固老社和发展新社有矛盾的错误认识必须克服。
