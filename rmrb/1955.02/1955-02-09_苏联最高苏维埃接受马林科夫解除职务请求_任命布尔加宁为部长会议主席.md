Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 8th: TASS, Moscow, February 8th—The joint session of the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR was held in the Kremlin in Moscow at 1:00 PM this afternoon.

On the government platform were: the leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, members of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and ministers of various ministries. Many guests were also present. The diplomatic corps section and the press section for domestic and foreign journalists were filled.

A.P. Volkov, Chairman of the Soviet of the Union, announced that the Presidium of the joint session of the two chambers had received an application from G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, requesting his removal from the position of Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR. Volkov read the full text of the application. The application of G.M. Malenkov is as follows: To the Chairman of the Joint Session of the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities:

Please convey my request for removal from the position of Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR to the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

I submit this request after careful consideration of the need to strengthen the leadership of the Council of Ministers, and because it is appropriate for another comrade with rich experience in leading national work to assume the post of Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR. I clearly see that my lack of experience in local work, and my failure to directly manage certain departments of the national economy in a ministry or any economic institution, has had a negative impact on my performance of the complex and responsible duty of Chairman of the Council of Ministers.

I also consider it my responsibility to state in this application that now, when the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the working people of our country are particularly concentrating their efforts on rapidly raising agriculture, I particularly clearly see my own faults and the responsibility I bear for the unsatisfactory state of affairs in agriculture, because for many years before this, I was responsible for supervising and leading the work of the central agricultural organs, as well as the work of local party and Soviet organizations in agriculture. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union, on the initiative and under the leadership of its Central Committee, has formulated and is implementing a number of major measures to overcome the backwardness in agriculture. The reform of agricultural taxes is undoubtedly one of these important measures, and I would like to mention in passing that this measure was implemented based on the initiative and recommendations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and it can already be seen that this reform plays an important role in developing agriculture. Now, as everyone knows, under the initiative and leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, a general program has been formulated for overcoming the backwardness in agriculture and developing agriculture at the fastest possible speed. This program is based on the following sole correct principle: continuing to strive to develop heavy industry, and only by realizing this can we create the necessary conditions for a true surge in the production of all necessary consumer goods.

It can be predicted that all kinds of neurotic bourgeois politicians will engage in slanderous fabrications about my application and my removal from the position of Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR. But we Communists and Soviet people will ignore such rumors and slanders. For each of us, the interests of the motherland, the people, and the Communist Party are above everything else.

I request to be relieved of my duties as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, and I would like to give the Supreme Soviet of the USSR the assurance that in the new work position entrusted to me, under the leadership of the united and rock-solid Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government, I will most faithfully fulfill my responsibilities and obligations. G.M. Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, February 8, 1955.

Next, A.M. Puzanov spoke. He said that he believed the reasons presented in Comrade Malenkov's application were completely correct, and he suggested accepting Comrade Malenkov's application and relieving him of his duties as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR.

The Supreme Soviet of the USSR decided to accept Comrade Malenkov's application and relieve him of his duties as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR.

Then, a recess was announced, and the meeting continued at 4:00 PM.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 8th: TASS, Moscow, February 8th—The joint session of the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, which was held at 1:00 PM this afternoon, continued at 4:00 PM after the recess.

N.S. Khrushchev, representative of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, spoke about the issue of candidates for the position of Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR. Entrusted by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the heads of the delegations of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, he suggested appointing N.A. Bulganin as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR. Khrushchev said that Bulganin is an outstanding activist of the Party and the state.

The Supreme Soviet of the USSR unanimously passed the resolution to appoint N.A. Bulganin as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR.

Next, V.M. Molotov, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and Minister of Foreign Affairs, gave a report on the international situation and the foreign policy of the Soviet government.

    苏联最高苏维埃接受马林科夫解除职务请求
    任命布尔加宁为部长会议主席
   【新华社八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科八日讯：苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院八日下午一时在莫斯科的克里姆林宫举行了联席会议。
    在政府席上的有：苏联共产党和苏联政府的领导人，苏联最高苏维埃主席团委员，各部部长。到会的还有许多来宾。外交使节席和国内外新闻记者席上都坐满了人。
    联盟院主席亚·彼·沃尔科夫宣布，两院联席会议主席收到了苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫的关于请求解除他的苏联部长会议主席的职务的申请书。沃尔科夫宣读了申请书的全文。格·马·马林科夫的申请书如下：联盟院和民族院联席会议主席：
    请您把我关于解除苏联部长会议主席职务的请求转达给苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃。
    我提出这个请求，是因为认真地考虑到必须加强部长会议的领导，因为考虑到由另外一位对领导国家工作富有经验的同志担任苏联部长会议主席的职务是适宜的。我清楚地看到，由于我缺乏地方工作的经验，以及我没有在部里或任何经济机关中直接管理过国民经济的某些部门，这就对我执行部长会议主席这个复杂和责任重大的职务产生了不好的影响。
    我还认为自己有责任在这个申请书中说明，现在，当苏联共产党和我国劳动人民正在特别集中力量来争取急速提高农业的时候，我特别清楚地看到自己的过失和对农业中存在的不能令人满意的状况所要负的责任，因为在这以前的好几年中，我一直负责监督和领导中央农业机关的工作，以及地方党和苏维埃组织在农业方面的工作。苏联共产党在它的中央委员会的创议和领导下，已经制订了并且正在实行若干重大的措施来克服农业中的落后状况。在农业税方面的改革无疑是这种重要措施之一，关于这一点，我想顺便谈一下，这一措施是根据苏联共产党中央委员会的创议和建议而实行的，并且现在已经可以看出这一改革对于发展农业所起的重要作用。现在，大家知道，在苏联共产党中央委员会的创议和领导下，已经制订出了关于克服农业中的落后状况并以最快的速度发展农业的总纲领。这个纲领是以下面这一唯一正确的原则为依据的：继续尽力发展重工业，并且只有实现这一点，才能为一切必需消费品生产的真正高涨创造必要的条件。
    可以预料，形形色色的神经质的资产阶级政客们，将对我这个申请书和解除我的苏联部长会议主席职务这件事进行诬蔑性的捏造。但是我们共产党员和苏联人将不理睬这种谣言和诬蔑。对于我们每个人说来，祖国、人民、共产党的利益是高于一切的。
    我请求解除我的苏联部长会议主席的职务，我愿意向苏联最高苏维埃提出保证，在委托给我的新的工作岗位上，我将在团结一致的、坚如磐石的苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联政府的领导下，最忠诚地完成我的责任和履行我将要担负的义务。苏联部长会议主席格·马林科夫一九五五年二月八日
    接着，亚·米·普扎诺夫发言。他说，他认为马林科夫同志的申请书中所提出的理由是完全正确的，他建议接受马林科夫同志的申请书，并且解除马林科夫同志的苏联部长会议主席的职务。
    苏联最高苏维埃决定：接受马林科夫同志的申请书，并解除他的苏联部长会议主席的职务。
    接着，宣布休会，到下午四时继续开会。
   【新华社八日讯】塔斯社莫斯科八日讯：苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院八日下午一时举行的联席会议，在休息之后在下午四时继续举行。
    苏联最高苏维埃代表尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫发言，谈到了苏联部长会议主席职位候选人的问题。他受苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联最高苏维埃各代表团团长会议的委托，建议任命尼·亚·布尔加宁为苏联部长会议主席。赫鲁晓夫说，布尔加宁是党和国家的杰出的活动家。
    苏联最高苏维埃一致通过了任命尼·亚·布尔加宁为苏联部长会议主席的决议。
    接着，苏联部长会议第一副主席兼外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫发言，就国际局势和苏联政府的外交政策作了报告。
