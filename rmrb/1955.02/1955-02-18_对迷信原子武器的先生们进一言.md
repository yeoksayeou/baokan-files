A Word to the Gentlemen Who Superstitiously Believe in Atomic Weapons
Méi Lánfāng, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association

The people of the whole world all detest war, oppose war, and desire to live a peaceful and happy life. The history of the world proves that throughout the ages, all wars launched for the benefit of a few have resulted in their own destruction. Take the fascist aggressor group headed by Hitler not long ago. The tragic end they met after launching World War II serves as a lesson! It is truly strange that there are still people picking up Hitler's ancestral tablet from the trash can, placing it on their heads, and presenting him with discipleship letters. Hitler's disciples and grandchildren's all-out performance has become the foundation of these people.

These inheritors of Hitler's tradition of aggression are the American imperialists. The magic weapon of the American imperialists for aggression is the atomic bomb. They believe they are more confident than their teacher, relying on this weapon to be invincible in the world, to wantonly invade others, and to clamor for and instigate a world war. They are blinded by their own arrogance and cannot see that this inhumane and absurd method not only cannot scare people but also arouses extreme anger and meets with the resolute opposition of peace-loving people all over the world.

Conversely, the peace-loving Soviet government has announced the success of the first atomic energy industrial power station and is prepared to impart the secrets of atomic energy to peace-loving countries to engage in industrial construction for the benefit of the people. This makes it clearer to the people of the world how perverse and contrary to the wishes of mankind American imperialism is. Therefore, the war-mongers' attempt to monopolize atomic energy to achieve the purpose of invading others is a heinous and unforgivable act, whether from the perspective of the International Charter or from the perspective of human morality. But this cannot scare people. Recently, Comrade Molotov pointed out in his report the achievements of the Soviet Union in hydrogen weapons, which is the most powerful proof. Here, another bucket of cold water is poured on the heads of the war-mongers who advocate the imperialist "policy of strength."

The signature campaign of the Chinese people against the use of atomic weapons has now been launched on a large scale. Our drama workers, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao for more than five years, have received profound ideological education, improved their political awareness, and recognized the importance of defending the motherland and defending Asian and world peace. In this great movement, we will certainly be able to enthusiastically sign our names along with the people of the whole country, demonstrate our righteous strength, and completely smash the imperialists' conspiracy to launch an atomic war.

Finally, I would like to offer a word to those gentlemen who superstitiously believe in atomic weapons: You should wake up! You should see this inviolable, huge force and stop digging your own graves. This road is a dead end! The only way out you can have is to abandon this inhumane policy and coexist peacefully with other countries in the world. This is the most beneficial and just path, and it is also in line with the common aspirations of the people of the world. If you are stubbornly unrepentant, then you yourselves will be destroyed by atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs in the future!

    对迷信原子武器的先生们进一言
    中国戏剧家协会副主席　梅兰芳
    全世界的人民，都是厌恶战争、反对战争，都是愿意过着和平幸福生活的。世界的历史可以证明，古往今来，凡是为了少数人利益而发动的战争，所得到的结果，总是自身的毁灭。就说不久以前以希特勒为首的法西斯侵略集团，在发动第二次世界大战后所得到的悲惨下场，就是前车之鉴！真奇怪，现在居然还有人从垃圾桶里拾起希特勒的神主牌位，顶在头上，向他递门生帖子，希特勒的徒子徒孙全武行也就成了这些人的班底。
    这继承了希特勒侵略传统的，就是美帝国主义者。美帝国主义者侵略的法宝，就是原子弹。他们自以为比他们老师更有把握，依赖这一种武器，可以无敌于天下，可以肆无忌惮地侵略别人，叫嚣和煽动世界大战。他们冲昏头脑，看不到这种灭绝人道的荒谬办法，不但吓不倒人，反而激起了极大愤怒，遭到了全世界爱好和平的人民的坚决反对。
    相反的，爱好和平的苏联政府却宣布了第一个原子能工业电力站的成功，准备把原子能的秘密传授给爱好和平的国家，来从事工业建设，谋人民福利。这就使全世界人民更清楚地认识到，美帝国主义是何等的倒行逆施，违反人类的愿望。所以，战争贩子们企图垄断原子能，以达到侵略别人的目的，无论从国际宪章上说，从人类道德上说，都是罪大恶极，无可宽恕的行为。但这是吓不倒人的。最近莫洛托夫同志在报告中指出苏联在氢武器方面的成就，就是最有力的证明。这里又一次给帝国主义“实力政策”的战争叫嚣者兜头浇了一桶凉水。
    中国人民反对使用原子武器的签名运动，现在已经大规模展开。我们戏剧工作者，五年多以来，在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下，受到了很深刻的思想教育，提高了政治觉悟，认识了保卫祖国和保卫亚洲和世界和平的重要意义，在这一次伟大运动中，一定能够和全国人民一道踊跃签名，表现出我们的正义的力量，使帝国主义者准备发动原子战争的阴谋完全粉碎。
    最后，我想对那些迷信原子武器的先生们进一言：你们该醒醒了！你们应该看清这不可侮的巨大力量，不要再替自己掘坟了。这条道路是死路！你们所能有的唯一生路，只有放弃这种灭绝人道的政策，和全世界的其他国家和平共处，这才是最有利的正当途径，同时也是符合于全世界人民的共同愿望的。如果执迷不悟，那将来被原子弹和氢气弹毁灭的就将会是你们自己！
