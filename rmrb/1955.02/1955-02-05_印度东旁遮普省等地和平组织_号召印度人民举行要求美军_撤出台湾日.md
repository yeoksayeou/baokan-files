    号召印度人民举行要求美军“撤出台湾日”
    【新华社新德里四日电】印度东旁遮普省、巴地阿拉及东旁遮普邦联盟和北方省的和平组织最近分别号召人民在二月六日举行“撤出台湾日”。
    东旁遮普省和平委员会一日在朱龙多城举行会议时通过决议，宣布台湾和澎湖列岛是中国不可分割的领土，并且对美国政府在中国的台湾和沿海岛屿所采取的军事侵略行动表示极大的关注。决议要求东旁遮普省一切爱好和平的人们举行“撤出台湾日”。
    巴地阿拉及东旁遮普邦联盟和平理事会也在一日在巴纳拉举行会议，并且决定在二月六日“撤出台湾日”在巴地阿拉和其他城市举行群众大会。理事会书记拉米西·华里亚在会上就最近在马德拉斯举行的全印争取和平和亚洲团结大会作了报告。理事会根据他的报告决定争取巴地阿拉及东旁遮普邦联盟的农民协会和学生联合会的充分合作，在这个邦里发动一个争取亚洲团结和拥护周恩来—尼赫鲁联合声明的广泛的运动。为了响应和平理事会的决定，巴地阿拉及东旁遮普邦联盟农民协会已决定在二月六日在巴地阿拉及东旁遮普邦联盟的各大村庄举行群众大会。
    北方省和平理事会总书记伊沙克·桑巴里发出通知，要求各和平委员会和其他的群众团体以充分的力量和热情来举行“撤出台湾日”。通知指出：中国的领土台湾还没有解放。美国战争贩子已经把这个岛屿变成了战争基地，并且正在危害着中国的独立。
