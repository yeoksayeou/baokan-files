Xinhua News Agency, London, 17th: The "News Chronicle" published on the 16th a conversation between British Labour leader Clement Attlee and the newspaper's columnist, Percy Cudlipp. Attlee said: "The urgent need now is to find a way to ease tensions. I don't see how tensions can be eased when Chiang Kai-shek, under the protection of American forces, continues to attack the mainland and declares his intention to reconquer all of China. Therefore, I think Chiang Kai-shek and his main followers should be exiled."
Attlee added: "After the war, the Allies recognized that the island (Taiwan) is an inseparable part of China."
Attlee believes that "in the current situation, one of the most urgent needs is to invite the government of Communist China into the United Nations. This is also essential to ease tensions. Today, it is the people in Beijing, not Chiang Kai-shek, who are speaking for China. To ignore such a fact is completely unrealistic and dangerous."
The Executive Committee of the Shop Assistants and Delivery Workers' Union, representing approximately 350,000 workers, issued a statement on the 16th expressing its full support for Attlee's suggestion to exile Chiang Kai-shek. It further said that "the United States should abandon its policy of regarding Taiwan as an indispensable link in its island defense chain."

    英国工党领袖艾德礼就台湾问题发表谈话
    【新华社十七日讯】伦敦消息：“新闻纪事报”十六日发表了英国工党领袖艾德礼向该报专栏作家佩西·卡德里普发表的谈话。艾德礼说：“目前迫切的需要是寻找一条缓和紧张局势的道路。当蒋介石在美国部队保护之下继续袭击大陆并且宣称他打算重新征服全中国的时候，我看不到紧张局势能得到缓和。因此我认为蒋介石和他的主要随从者应该被放逐。”
    艾德礼又说：“战后，盟国承认这个岛（台湾）是中国的不可分割的一部分。”
    艾德礼认为，“在目前情况下，最迫切的需要之一就是邀请共产党中国的政府进入联合国。这对缓和紧张局势也是至为必要的。今天是北京方面的人而不是蒋介石在代表中国说话，无视这样一个事实，是完全不现实和危险的。”
    代表约三十五万名工人的店员与送货工人联合会的执行委员会，十六日发表声明表示完全支持艾德礼关于放逐蒋介石的建议。它又说，“美国应当放弃它把台湾当作岛屿防御锁链中必不可少的一环的政策”。
