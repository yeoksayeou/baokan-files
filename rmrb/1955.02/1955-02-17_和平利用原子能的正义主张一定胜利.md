    The just cause of peaceful use of atomic energy will surely prevail
    Chen Jingshe, Chairman of Wuhan Federation of Industry and Commerce
    Opposing atomic warfare and demanding that atomic energy be used only for peaceful purposes is the common aspiration of peace-loving people all over the world. The declarations, letters to the European people, and letters to the people of the world issued recently by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council in Vienna fully embody the people's will to strive for peace and their determination to prevent the resurgence of German militarism and the use of atomic weapons.
    People will never forget the atomic bomb disasters suffered by Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan in 1945, and the injuries and deaths of Japanese fishermen caused by the US hydrogen bomb test on Bikini Atoll in the Pacific in 1954. These tragic events cannot leave any person of conscience unmoved. We Chinese people deeply sympathize with the Japanese people, and have learned lessons from these unfortunate events, resolutely oppose the use of atomic weapons, and shatter the war plot of the US aggressive bloc.
    In the summer of 1954, half a year after the world's first atomic energy industrial power station established by the Soviet Union began to generate electricity, the Soviet Union was ready to make a public report on the first atomic energy industrial power station and its operation at the international conference discussing the peaceful use of atomic energy. Subsequently, the Soviet government also proposed to China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and the German Democratic Republic to provide scientific, technical, and industrial assistance in promoting research on the peaceful uses of atomic energy, and at the same time considered expanding the scope of countries it could assist, so that the Soviet Union's outstanding scientific achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy could widely benefit mankind. These efforts and achievements of the Soviet government and people are a great contribution to the cause of world peace, and also a heavy blow to the warmongers who clamor for atomic war and insist on the policy of atomic blackmail.
    The Soviet Union's development in the peaceful use of atomic energy and its resolute struggle against the use of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons express the genuine desire of the people of the world to oppose war and safeguard peace, and powerfully support the international peace movement. In contrast, the US imperialists and their followers are frantically preparing for atomic war. Two-thirds of the 1956 US fiscal budget is directly used for military purposes, and this military expenditure will "mainly focus on the development of more effective use of nuclear energy for military activities." At the same time, the US aggressive bloc is also actively planning to revive West German militarism, organize the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, and continue to occupy our territory of Taiwan, creating tensions in Europe and the Far East to realize its atomic war plot. The US warmongers have more than once clamored to use atomic weapons against the Korean people. Recently, the United States even threatened our people with atomic weapons and armed intervention in our liberation of Taiwan. However, atomic weapons cannot scare the Chinese people. Taiwan is the sacred and inviolable territory of the People's Republic of China. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan and will never allow any aggressor to interfere in our internal affairs. Neither atomic weapons nor cunning diplomatic tactics can shake the determination of the 600 million Chinese people to liberate Taiwan.
    We private industrialists and businessmen, together with the people of the whole country and the peace-loving people of the world, warmly support the resolution of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council on calling for strengthening the struggle against the threat of atomic war, resolutely advocate the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and resolutely advocate that atomic energy should only be used for peaceful purposes. Resolutely oppose the evil policy of preparing for atomic war. With the comprehensive and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, China's peaceful construction and atomic energy cause will surely achieve rapid development, and the forces defending world peace will be further consolidated and strengthened. The power generated by the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union is an unparalleled power. This power is not only a reliable guarantee for the security of the two countries, but also an important factor in maintaining peace in the Far East and the world. We firmly believe that the power of the people is invincible. The warmongers who plot to launch an atomic war will surely suffer the consequences of their own evil deeds. Final victory will surely belong to the peace-loving people all over the world who adhere to the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    和平利用原子能的正义主张一定胜利
    武汉市工商业联合会主任委员　陈经畬
    反对原子战争，要求原子能只许用于和平用途，这是全世界爱好和平的人民的共同愿望。最近在维也纳举行的世界和平理事会常务委员会所发表的宣言，告欧洲人民书和告全世界人民书，正充分地体现了人民争取和平的意志和防止德国军国主义再起、防止使用原子武器的决心。
    人们永远不会忘记一九四五年日本的广岛和长崎遭受的原子弹的祸害，以及一九五四年美国在太平洋比基尼岛进行氢弹试验引致的日本渔民的伤亡，这些惨痛的事件，是任何一个有良心的人都不能无动于衷的。我们中国人民深切地同情日本人民，并且从这些不幸事件中得到教训，坚决反对使用原子武器，粉碎美国侵略集团的战争阴谋。
    在一九五四年夏天，苏联创立的世界上第一个原子能工业电力站开始发电的半年以后，苏联就准备向讨论和平利用原子能的国际会议进行关于第一个原子能工业电力站及其工作情况的公开报告，接着苏联政府又向我国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚、德意志民主共和国提出在促进原子能和平用途的研究方面提供科学、技术和工业上的帮助的建议，同时还考虑扩大它所能援助的国家的范围，使苏联在和平利用原子能方面的卓越科学成果得以广泛地为人类造福。苏联政府和人民的这些努力和成就，是对世界和平事业的伟大贡献，也是对猖狂叫嚣发动原子战争，坚持原子讹诈政策的好战分子的沉重打击。
    苏联在和平利用原子能方面的发展和坚决禁止使用原子武器和氢武器的斗争，表达了全世界人民反对战争，维护和平的真正愿望，有力地支持了国际和平运动。但与此相反，美帝国主义及其追随者都在疯狂地准备原子战争。一九五六年度美国财政预算的三分之二是直接用于军事目的，而这笔军事开支“主要侧重点将更有效地利用核子能于军事活动的发展。”同时，美国侵略集团还积极策划复活西德军国主义，组织东南亚侵略集团和继续侵占我国领土台湾，造成欧洲和远东的紧张局势，以实现其原子战争的阴谋。美国的好战分子曾不止一次地叫嚣要对朝鲜人民使用原子武器。最近美国竟以原子武器威胁我国人民，武装干涉我国解放台湾。但是，原子武器是吓不倒中国人民的。台湾是中华人民共和国神圣不可侵犯的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾，绝不容许任何侵略者干涉我国内政。无论是原子武器，无论是狡猾的外交手腕，都丝毫不可能动摇六万万中国人民解放台湾的决心。
    我们私营工商业者和全国人民一道，同全世界爱好和平的人民一道，热烈拥护世界和平理事会常务委员会关于号召为反对原子战争威胁而加强斗争的决议，坚决主张禁止使用原子武器和氢武器，坚决主张原子能只能用于和平的目的。坚决反对准备原子战争的罪恶政策。在苏联全面无私的帮助下，我国的和平建设及原子能事业必将获得飞跃的发展，保卫世界和平的力量将更加巩固和壮大。中苏两国友好合作产生的力量是无可匹敌的力量，这种力量不仅是两国安全的可靠保证，并且是维护远东和世界和平的重要因素。我们深信人民的力量是无坚不摧的。阴谋发动原子战争的好战分子必将自食其恶果。最后的胜利一定属于坚持和平利用原子能的全世界爱好和平的人民。
