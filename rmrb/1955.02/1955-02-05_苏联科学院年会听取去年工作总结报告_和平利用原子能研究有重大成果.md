Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd. TASS dispatch: The annual meeting of the Soviet Academy of Sciences opened on the 2nd at the House of Scientific Workers in Moscow. Prominent Soviet scientists attended the meeting.

Academician A.N. Nesmeyanov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, delivered the opening speech. He said that the characteristics of Soviet scientific development in the past year were the further development of research work in nuclear physics, electronics, semiconductor physics, and other fields. We have studied the interactions of particles and nuclei of various energies, and the problem of nuclear reactions. Academician Nesmeyanov focused on the organization of research work, technical equipment, and liaison issues, all of which must adapt to the ever-developing scientific tasks. In this regard, he talked about the role that the Scientific Information Institute should play in exchanging research work experience between the Soviet Union and other countries.

Academician A.V. Topchiev made a report on the summary of the main work of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1954. The first part of the report discussed the achievements in the research work on the peaceful use of atomic energy.

Academician Topchiev said that the question of the use of atomic energy is the focus of attention of world public opinion. New war instigators openly declare their plans to use atomic weapons to slaughter peace-loving people of all countries. This challenge to humanity has aroused great hatred among all honest people around the world. The forces of peace and progress are uniting to stop the threat of a devastating atomic war and strive to use this great discovery of human wisdom for the benefit of the people. The sacred duty of scientists is to ensure that atomic energy and all scientific achievements are not used for war and destruction, but for peace and construction.

Academician Topchiev reported that in 1954, Soviet scientists and engineers had achieved important achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy. The work of using atomic energy for power has been successfully concluded with the completion and power generation of the world's first industrial power plant using fissionable materials as fuel. The atomic energy industrial power plant of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, with an effective power generation capacity of 5,000 kilowatts, has been put into production and supplies power to industry and agriculture in the surrounding areas.

Topchiev said that extensive research work has also been carried out in the research of other uses of atomic energy, especially in the use of "tracer atoms." Relying on this method based on the radioactivity of nuclei, new and effective methods of automatic control and management technology processes have been created. Many special instruments used in the metallurgical, papermaking, and rubber industries have been created.

Various departments of the Soviet national economy widely use the method of "tracer atoms." This method helps to solve complex problems in biology and medicine, provides accurate materials on the recovery rate of brain and muscle proteins, and can discover the physiological processes of plants. Relying on the method of "tracer atoms," we now know that organic matter created by photosynthesis moves from the leaves to the roots (in plants such as beets and pumpkins) at a rate of seventy to one hundred centimeters or more per hour. Topchiev said that agricultural workers should take this into account and adapt the methods of caring for plants to the "speed" of plant vitality.

New methods of research have also been adopted in chemical and technical sciences. For example, with the help of scientists, a factory studied and tested a rapid analysis method for slag phosphorus using the factory's furnaces. This method can effectively control the smelting process and precisely select phosphorus-containing slag for use as agricultural fertilizer.

Academician Topchiev said that these achievements in nuclear physics will infiltrate into various departments of science and national economy more and more widely year by year.

Research into new methods for the peaceful use of atomic energy is an important task for all scientists.

Academician Topchiev then talked about other issues in physics and mathematics, chemistry, technology and biology, geology and geography, and social sciences. He pointed out that a great deal of work was carried out in all aspects last year, comprehensively studying the natural resources of the Soviet Union.

Academician Topchiev finally talked about the development of international ties of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In the past year, scientists from the Academy participated in sixty-five international and many national conferences of various countries. 350,000 books and magazines were sent abroad for exchange purposes.

Academician Berg spoke about the current situation and development prospects of radio electronics.

    苏联科学院年会听取去年工作总结报告
    和平利用原子能研究有重大成果
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科三日电：苏联科学院年会于二日在莫斯科科学工作者之家开幕。出席会议的有苏联的大科学家。
    苏联科学院院长亚·尼·涅斯米扬诺夫院士在会上致开幕词。他说，过去一年苏联科学发展的特点是，核子物理学、电子学、半导体物理学等方面的研究工作有了进一步的发展。我们研究了各种能量的粒子和原子核的相互作用及核子反应的问题。涅斯米扬诺夫院士着重谈到研究工作的组织问题、技术装备问题和联系问题，这些都必须适应于日益发展的科学任务。在这方面，他谈到科学情报所在苏联和其他国家交流研究工作经验方面应起的作用。
    亚·维·托普切夫院士做了关于苏联科学院一九五四年主要工作总结的报告。报告的第一部分谈到关于和平利用原子能的研究工作的成果。
    托普切夫院士说，关于原子能的用途问题是目前全世界舆论注意的中心。新战争挑拨者公开宣布他们要用原子武器屠杀爱好和平的各国人民的计划。这一对人类的挑战引起了全世界一切正直的人的极大的仇恨。和平和进步的力量正在团结起来制止毁灭性的原子战争的威胁，争取这一人类智慧的极其伟大的发现用于造福人民。科学家的神圣职责就是：使原子能以及所有的科学成就不是用于战争和破坏，而是用于和平和建设。
    托普切夫院士报告说，一九五四年苏联科学家和工程师在原子能的和平用途方面已取得了重要的成就。原子能用于动力方面的工作已以世界第一个用分裂物质为燃料的工业电力站落成和发电而告成功。苏联科学院的、有效发电能力为五千瓩的原子能工业电力站已投入生产，并向周围地区的工农业供应电力。
    托普切夫说道，在研究原子能的其他用途，特别是在“示踪原子”的用途方面，也展开了广泛的研究工作。依靠这种以核子的放射性为基础的方法，创造了新的自动控制和管理技术过程的有效办法。创造了许多冶金、造纸、橡胶工业所使用的特别仪器。
    苏联国民经济各部门广泛地利用“示踪原子”的方法。这种方法有助于解决生物学和医学的复杂问题，给予关于脑髓和肌肉蛋白质的恢复速度的准确材料，可以发现植物的生理过程。依靠“示踪原子”的方法，我们现在得知，光合作用所造成的有机物质从叶部向根部移动（在甜菜和南瓜等植物），每小时移动七十至一百公分或再多一些。托普切夫说道，农业工作人员应该考虑到这点，使照料植物的方法适合于植物生机的“速度”。
    研究工作的新方法也在化学和技术科学方面被采用了。例如，有一个工厂在科学家的帮助下，用工厂的炉子研究出了并且试验了矿渣磷分的快速分析法。这个方法可以有效地控制冶炼过程，精密地选出含磷矿渣，用来作为农业肥料。
    托普切夫院士说，核子物理学的这些成就将一年比一年广泛地渗入到科学和国民经济的各个部门。
    对和平使用原子能的新的方法的研究是全体科学家的重要任务。
    托普切夫院士接着谈到了物理数学、化学、技术生物、地质地理、社会科学各方面的其他问题。他指出，去年在各方面进行了巨大的工作，全面地研究了苏联的天然财富。
    托普切夫院士最后谈到了苏联科学院国际联系发展的情况。在去年一年内，科学院的科学家参加了六十五次国际性的和许多国家全国性的各种会议。向国外寄出了三十五万册书籍和杂志作为交换之用。
    别尔格院士发言谈到了无线电电子学目前的情况和发展的远景。
