To the Editor:
    At the end of last year, I went to Zhangdian Town in the Seventh District to investigate the participation of families of revolutionary martyrs, military dependents, and demobilized construction soldiers in mutual aid teams and agricultural production cooperatives. I discovered that the chairmen of the agricultural production cooperatives were affecting production because they held too many concurrent positions.
    There are four agricultural production cooperatives in Zhangdian Town. According to my understanding: Zhang Zhiwen, chairman of the First Agricultural Cooperative, concurrently holds five positions: township government member, civil affairs director, supply and marketing cooperative supervisor, production and disaster relief committee member, and unified purchase and sales committee member. Liu Guifang, the vice-chairman, concurrently holds five positions: public security director, Communist Youth League branch secretary, people's armed forces committee member, production and disaster relief committee member, and unified purchase and sales committee member. Li Yongde, chairman of the Second Agricultural Cooperative, concurrently holds seven positions: township government member, culture and education director, principal of the people's school, credit cooperative supervisor, supply and marketing cooperative supervisor, production and disaster relief committee member, and unified purchase and sales committee member. Zhang Zhixue, chairman of the Third Agricultural Cooperative, concurrently holds six positions: civil affairs committee member, transportation team leader, supply and marketing cooperative director and supervisor, people's armed forces committee member, production and disaster relief committee member, and unified purchase and sales committee member. With so many concurrent positions, they inevitably spend a lot of time in meetings. For example, on November 22nd alone, they attended five meetings, including a youth league meeting, a forum for demobilized construction soldiers, and meetings with different groups of people. Having too many concurrent positions and attending too many meetings greatly affects their own production and lives. For example, in the First Agricultural Cooperative, ordinary male laborers could earn 500 work points from spring to autumn last year, and the lowest could earn 400 work points, but Zhang Zhiwen, the chairman, who is a good laborer, only earned 192 points. Women earned a maximum of 400 work points, and generally around 300 work points, but Liu Guifang, the vice-chairman, who is a strong laborer, only earned 204 work points. The situation of the chairmen of the other three cooperatives is similar to theirs. I think this situation is worth paying attention to. Of course, it is entirely necessary to absorb leading cadres of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams into the grassroots government in rural areas. However, it is not good to concentrate too many things on one person. The leading organs should be concerned about the production and livelihood problems of these people who hold too many concurrent positions, and correct the phenomenon of holding too many concurrent positions.

    他们兼职过多得分最少编辑同志：
    去年年底，我到七区张店镇调查组织烈属、军属、复员建设军人参加互助组和农业生产合作社的情况，发现农业生产合作社社长因为兼职过多，影响了生产。
    张店镇共有四个农业生产合作社，据我了解：第一农业社社长张志文，兼有乡政委员、民政主任、供销社监委、生产救灾委员、统购统销委员等五职；副社长刘桂芳，兼有公安主任、团支书、人民武装委员、生产救灾委员、统购统销委员等五职。第二农业社社长李永德，兼有乡政委员、文教主任、民校校长、信用社监委理事、供销社监委、生产救灾委员和统购统销委员等七职。第三农业社社长张志学，兼有民政委员、运输车队长、供销社理监委、人民武装委员、生产救灾和统购统销委员等六职。兼职多，开会的时间也必然很多。比如仅仅去年十一月二十二日那一天，就开了青年会、复员建设军人座谈会、分片群众会等五个会。兼职多、开会多，就对他们自己的生产和生活影响很大。如第一农业社，去年由春到秋一般的男劳力可得五百个工分，最低的也能得四百个工分，但社长张志文是个好劳力，却只得了一百九十二分；妇女最多的得四百个工分，一般的可得三百左右个工分，副社长刘桂芳劳力很强，只得了二百零四个工分。其他三个社的社长的情况也和他们差不多。我觉得这个情况确是值得引起注意的。当然，在农村的基层政权中吸收农业生产合作社和互助组的领导骨干参加，是完全必要的。但把许多事情都集中在一个人身上却是不好的。领导机关应该关心这些兼职过多的人的生产和生活问题，纠正兼职过多的现象。
