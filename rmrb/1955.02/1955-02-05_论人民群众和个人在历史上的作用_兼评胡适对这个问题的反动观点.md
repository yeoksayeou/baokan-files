    On the Role of the People and the Individual in History
    —Also a Critique of Hu Shih’s Reactionary Views on This Issue
  　Sha Ying
    The question of the role of the people and the individual in history is a very important one in the fields of sociology and history. Among scholars of many exploiting classes, a very widespread erroneous view prevails, holding that history is created by individual outstanding figures, the so-called heroes, magnates, emperors, generals, and ministers, and that the masses blindly follow them, and can be manipulated by them at will. According to their view, history is like a lump of clay, which outstanding figures can mold into whatever shape they want. According to their view, the rise and fall of states, the change of dynasties, the occurrence of all great revolutionary events, and the transformation of social systems in past history are all the results of the activities of heroes and great men. That is to say, "heroes create the times" and "heroes are history." This is a idealistic view of history. For example, Liang Qichao in our country believed that "history is the offspring of a few great figures," he said: "Imagine the entire history of China, if we lost a Confucius, a Qin Shi Huang, a Han Wudi...what would the situation be like?" [1] Another example is the Russian Narodniks, who called the masses "the mob," believing that "the mob" should wait for "heroes" to establish great achievements, and that "the mob" could not engage in any organized activities, but could only blindly follow "heroes." Therefore, the Narodniks refused to carry out mass revolutionary work among the peasants and the working class, and instead specialized in individual terrorist means of struggle.
    When bourgeois scholars use this viewpoint to study social life and historical events, they place the focus on the activities of individual figures in history, only examining the ideological motives of historical figures' actions, and are unable to reveal the material basis of these motives, so they cannot discover the objective laws of social development, and thus cannot correctly understand the role of the people and the individual in history.
    In human history, only Marx and Engels gave a thorough materialist explanation of social life and history for the first time, discovered the laws of social development, and correctly pointed out the role of the people and the individual in historical development.
      Hu Shih was a follower of pragmatism. Pragmatism is a most reactionary philosophical thought of the American bourgeoisie, and along with European Machism, Empirio-criticism, etc., belongs to the most decadent subjective idealism of the bourgeoisie in the era of imperialism. Hu Shih used pragmatism to examine and study social life and historical events, and thus placed the focus on the activities of individual figures. He fundamentally did not understand the material basis and objective laws of social development. For example, in his article "Painful Memories and Reflections," he clearly told us that the reason why China's six or seventy years of history had "accomplished nothing," and the "most important reason" for the failure of the Chinese nation's self-salvation movement, was the lack of a socio-political center of gravity. What is the center of gravity of society? He believed that: "The center of gravity in the imperial era should be in the imperial family," China's center of gravity in the late nineteenth century was "figures such as Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang," and later, "the leaders of the Hundred Days' Reform also caused a sensation for a time, almost creating a new center of gravity," "After the Xinhai Revolution, the leaders of the Kuomintang almost became the new center of gravity of society, but the old forces soon made a comeback, and the revolutionary days were too short, and the revolutionary leaders could not gain the faith of the whole country, so this new center of gravity soon collapsed...." From this, we can clearly see Hu Shih's reactionary viewpoint of historical idealism.
    Hu Shih's understanding of social life and history is simply absurd. Marxism-Leninism believes that there is a fundamental difference between human society and animal life, but Hu Shih said: "Man is only a kind of animal, and he only has differences in degree from other kinds of animals, and no differences in kind." [2] In this way, he lowered human life to the level of animals. Hu Shih also used the idea of gradual evolution of organisms in Darwin's theory of evolution to explain the development process of human society, saying that "the world is formed bit by bit, point by point" [3], with only quantitative increases and no qualitative changes, to deny the revolutionary development of society. This is a metaphysical view of development—vulgar evolutionism. Marxism-Leninism believes that social life and natural phenomena all develop according to laws, which are independent of human will, but Hu Shih said: "Reality is really a very obedient girl, who obeys us in everything and lets us paint her up and dress her up. 'Reality is like a piece of marble in our hands, which we can sculpt into whatever image we want'" [4]. That is to say, Hu Shih believes that history can be arbitrarily "manufactured" by human subjective will, is not restricted by any objective conditions, and has no laws to speak of. As for who will dress up this "girl" of history, and who will sculpt this "marble"? Needless to say, he is referring not to the masses but to individual outstanding figures.
      Hu Shih's observation and study of history with these erroneous and confused viewpoints not only made it impossible for him to understand the laws of historical development, but also made him fall into ridiculous situations. For example, he said: "From the perspective of us pragmatists, from my historical perspective, political history is like what the Dream of the Red Chamber says, 'It is either the east wind prevailing over the west wind, or the west wind prevailing over the east wind.'" [5] "Since Qin Shihuang, more than two thousand years of history has indeed presented a general trend of 'unity after a long period of division, and division after a long period of unity.'" [6] In 1930, when analyzing Chinese society, Hu Shih actually believed that there was neither capitalism nor a bourgeoisie, nor any imperialism in China, and that "the feudal system had already collapsed two thousand years ago." China's poverty and weakness was only due to "five devils" [7]. ... Such absurd remarks, etc., are all things that even ordinary middle school students can see today.
      The question of the role of the people and the individual in history is a question in the general theory of the laws of human social development. No matter how often Hu Shih chanted "scientific methods" and "historical attitudes" in many articles, because he did not understand the causes and laws of social development, and placed the focus of history on the activities of individual figures, he could not correctly understand the question of the role of the people and the individual in history.
    In Hu Shih's eyes, the people are ignorant and ignorant, blindly following, foolish, slaves, the embodiment of poverty and disease, and have no power. For example, he consciously distorted and used Ibsen's thought to express his contempt for the masses and only value individuals and a few people, promote bourgeois individualism, and spread the evil idea of ​​despising the people's revolution. He even openly said in many articles: "In this piglet world, the masses are not to be talked about, and the organization is not reliable..." [8] "A new society, a new country, is always created by some people who love freedom and truth, and never by ordinary slaves." [9] After the "May 30th" movement in 1925, he said this about this vigorous movement:
  "Mass movements always cannot last. This is not the Chinese people's 'tiger's head and snake's tail', 'five minutes of heat'. This is a common disease of the human race in the world. The so-called 'popular sentiment', the so-called 'mass movement', is only an emotional reaction aroused by a temporary big problem." "We can conclude that most of the sacrifices of the people's movement are wasted for nothing." (Emphasis added by Hu Shih) [10]
    It should be pointed out that Hu Shih not only despises the people, but also very much hates and opposes the revolutionary movement of the people. Everyone knows that he opposes fundamentally solving social problems by revolutionary methods, and advocates a little bit of reform. He once "sincerely declared": "Rather not avoid the name of 'counter-revolutionary'" to oppose the people's revolutionary movement led by the Communist Party. The fact is also true. He used some of the most vicious words in many articles to ridicule and curse the people's revolutionary movement. For example: he regarded "various revolutionary" actions as "wasting energy," as "inciting the inferior nature of blind action and cruelty," as "disturbing the peace of society and the country"; he slandered the organization of workers' and students' movements as "blind obedience, gullibility, arbitrariness," as "superficial agitation," as "manipulation by a few people"; during the War of Resistance Against Japan, he even cursed the People's Army who heroically and brilliantly persisted in the guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines as "bandits"...
    Regarding the role of the people in history, the views of Marxists-Leninists are completely opposite to those of Hu Shih.
    Marxists-Leninists believe that the people have infinite wisdom and great creativity, are the creators of all social material wealth, and are the determiners of social destiny and various revolutionary struggles. World history is created by the people.
    Just as Darwin discovered the laws of development in the biological world, Marx and Engels discovered the laws of development in human society. In the eyes of Marx and Engels, what ultimately determines social development is not the wishes and ideas of outstanding figures, but the development of the material conditions of social existence, the production of material materials necessary for social survival, and the change of production methods (including productive forces and production relations). Everyone knows that before engaging in political, scientific, and artistic activities, humans must first eat, wear clothes, and live in houses, but in order to obtain these material materials, humans must engage in labor production. Therefore, social history is first of all the history of the development of production, the change of production methods, and at the same time the history of the producers of material materials themselves, that is, the history of the working masses who are the basic force in the production process, and the history of the people of various countries.
    The people are also the force that ultimately determines the fate of society in the political sphere. Marxism proves that all human history to date
  (except for primitive communist society) is the history of class struggle. Class struggle is the driving force of social development, and revolution is the locomotive of history. The transition from one mode of production to another can only be realized through class struggle. One social system is replaced by another more advanced social system only through revolution, and revolution is the sharpest form of class struggle. That is to say, in class society, the struggle of the people, the struggle of the oppressed and exploited classes against their oppressors and exploiters, such as the struggle of slaves against slave owners, the struggle of peasants against landlords, the struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie, etc., is the basic content and main driving force of historical development. The most basic, decisive, and main force in every revolution in history is the people. Especially in times of revolution and years of liberation war, when millions of people are organized to actively participate in the struggle, the great power of the people is even more obvious. Lenin said:
  "At no time are the masses as capable of showing themselves as the active creators of a new social system as they are in times of revolution. In such periods, the people are capable of performing miracles that seem inconceivable from the narrow perspective of philistine gradualism." [11]
    Even in the field of spiritual culture, the people play a huge role. This is not only because people must rely on the labor of the people to have the material materials to maintain their lives when engaging in spiritual and cultural activities, but also because the life and creativity of the people are the source of wisdom and inspiration for all poets, writers, and scholars. Language is created by the people. Many great epics, songs, and myths are also created by the people. All great literary and artistic works are closely related to the people, and are reflections of the people's thoughts and lives. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The people's lives originally contain mineral deposits of literary and artistic raw materials...they are the inexhaustible and inexhaustible unique source of all literature and art." [12] All scientific inventions are due to the needs of the vast working masses in production and life at that time, and the possibility of this invention is also provided by the production and struggle of the people at that time. Gorky said: "The people are not only the power to create all material values, but also the only and infinite source of spiritual values...." [13]
    It should be especially pointed out that the role of the people in the era of socialist revolution and socialist construction is greatly strengthened. Originally, after the establishment of the Communist Party, under the leadership and guidance of the Communist Party, the people's awareness and organization were continuously improved, and its role was strengthened day by day. However, history proves that the deeper the social reform, the wider and more active the masses participating in the reform. In the era of socialist revolution and socialist construction, more masses than in any previous revolution will participate in the revolutionary struggle, and give full play to their initiative, activity, and creativity, to get rid of all kinds of exploitation and build a life in which the people are masters of their own affairs. The creativity of the people suppressed in the old society will be liberated and given full play. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people are consciously creating their own history. The glorious history of the success of the Soviet October Revolution and the construction of a socialist society proves this point. The vigorous development of various economic, political, and cultural constructions in our country over the past five years also proves this point. Stalin said: "The time when leaders were regarded as the only creators of history, and workers and peasants were regarded as worthless, is long gone. Now the destiny of nations and countries is not only determined by leaders, but first and foremost by millions of working masses. Workers and peasants work hard and silently to build factories and mills, build mines and railways, build collective farms and Soviet farms, create all kinds of living goods, and provide food and clothing to the world—this is the real hero and creator of a new life." [14]
    Hu Shih praised the role of the individual to the extreme. He believes that history is created by "talented people". For example, he said that the American Republic was created by Washington, and Washington "opened a new era for history". Why did a small island country, Japan, "suddenly become one of the three or five major powers in the world within half a century"? He believes that this is the result of the efforts of dozens of people such as Ito Hirobumi, Okubo Toshimichi, and Saigo Takamori. Hu Shih even embellished individual figures with a mysterious color, exaggerating their role to the point of absurdity, believing that they were not subject to the laws of historical development and could create and change everything at will. For example, he said: "He spits a mouthful of phlegm on the ground, which may destroy a village or a tribe. He has an idea, which may cause decades of bloody battles. He may 'make a country prosperous with a single word, or ruin a country with a single word.'" [15] "An erroneous political or social transformation meeting can cause hundreds of years of killing and bloodshed." [16] Hu Shih's remarks are not only exaggerating the role of individuals and promoting the idea of ​​personal worship, but also treating the development of society as an accumulation of some accidental events, with no laws to speak of.
    Since Hu Shih believes that history is created by "outstanding figures" rather than by the people, he places his hope for "saving the country" and "transforming society" on "outstanding figures," especially on outstanding intellectuals. After Hu Shih "analyzed" Chinese society and believed that the "five devils" were "the real objects of our revolution," he said that there was only one way to defeat these five major enemies: "That is to recognize our enemies, recognize our problems, gather the talents and intelligence of the whole country, fully adopt the world's scientific knowledge and methods, carry out conscious reforms step by step, and constantly receive the full effect of continuous reforms under conscious guidance." (Emphasis added by Hu Shih) [17] This method of relying on "talented people" and using "conscious reforms" is the method Hu Shih used to replace revolution, and is also the fundamental attitude and fundamental method he calls for transforming society. Therefore, Hu Shih advocated that saving the country should "start with ideology and learning" [18], that the warlords should be dealt with "only by fully developing the power of civil rule" [19], that the establishment of a social center of gravity "must be able to absorb and accommodate the outstanding talents of the country" [20], and also promoted "good people's government," promoted "education to save the country," praised the feudal ruling slave Wu Xun, and talked with great interest about running universities to train "leaders"...
    As for the issue of evaluating figures, in Hu Shih's view, there is no objective standard. For example, he said: "Twenty years ago, Kang Youwei was a Vicious Beast of reform party. Now Kang Youwei has become an old antique. Kang Youwei has not changed, but the people who value him have changed, so his value has also changed." [21] If this is the case, it is difficult to have an accurate yardstick for whether a figure's role in history is good or bad, big or small. If this is the case, Hu Shih can say nonsense: Mozi and Han Fei are "pragmatists", Wang Mang is a "socialist", Qin Hui is a "meritorious" minister, Zeng Guofan and others are "revival" generals...
    Regarding the role of the individual in history, the views of Marxists-Leninists are also completely different from those of Hu Shih.
    Although Marxism-Leninism acknowledges the decisive role of the people in history, it certainly does not deny the role of the individual in historical development, but it opposes exaggerating the role of the individual and the idea of ​​personal worship.
    True, Marxism-Leninism proves that social development is governed by laws and that there is historical necessity; but Marxism-Leninism also believes that social phenomena occur on the basis of human activities, and the historical process is completed not apart from people but due to human activities. Therefore, human activities, consciousness, and will are by no means equal to zero, but play a certain role in history and have a certain influence. The magnitude of this role and influence depends on a historical figure's ability to foresee events and influence the masses, the scale of their activities, and whether their will is strong.
    If a historical figure can follow the laws of social development, be good at linking his wishes, ideas, and activities with the struggle of the advanced class, and strive for the vital interests of the people, he can play an outstanding role, that is, promote and accelerate the process of history. Conversely, if a historical figure wants to violate the laws of social development, combine his activities with the interests of the reactionary class, confront the struggle of the advanced class, act recklessly, and attempt to turn back the clock, he will be crushed by the wheels of history. For example, Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Shih, and other public enemies of the people have been crushed by the wheels of history is the best example. Stalin said in "Conversation with the German Writer Ludwig": "Marxism never denies the role of outstanding figures, and does not deny that history is created by people.... But people create history, of course, not according to any fantasies, not at will. Every new generation encounters specific conditions that were already in place when they were born. The reason why great figures have some value is only because they are good at correctly understanding these conditions and understanding how to change these conditions. If they do not understand these conditions and want to change these conditions according to their own fantasies, then they, these people, will fall into the situation of Don Quixote."
    Therefore, we must never underestimate the role of outstanding figures. The people's struggle, the advanced political parties, all need their own leaders. Because such leaders can see farther than ordinary people, are experienced, can represent the interests of the majority of people, and can lead the masses in struggle. Especially the struggle of the working class, to eliminate all exploitation and classes, not only to liberate themselves but also to liberate all mankind, requires them to have a high degree of consciousness and organization, and correct and flexible strategies and tactics, which of course requires their own political parties and leaders. Lenin said: "Everyone knows that in most cases, at least in modern civilized countries, classes are usually led by political parties; political parties are usually led by a somewhat fixed group composed of the most prestigious, most influential, most experienced people who are elected to hold the most responsible positions and are called leaders." [22] Figures like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and other most outstanding and greatest leaders and mentors of the working class can correctly understand the laws of social development and the laws of class struggle, have unlimited love and loyalty to the people, and have an iron will and a fearless spirit... Their role and great contribution to world history is imaginable.
    It must be strictly pointed out that we acknowledge the role of outstanding figures, heroes, and leaders, we wholeheartedly support and love our own leaders of the people, and we also give varying degrees of praise and eulogy to those who have played a progressive role in history, but this has nothing in common with the idealistic overestimation of the role of individuals and the promotion of blind personal worship by Hu Shih and his like. Marxism-Leninism believes that: First of all, the emergence of heroes and great figures is not purely accidental, but has a certain inevitability. This inevitability lies in the fact that when history develops to a certain stage, especially in the era of revolutionary change, history puts forward new tasks and requires someone to lead the people to solve this historical task, some appropriate leading figures will emerge. For example, in the era of the bourgeois revolution, bourgeois revolutionary leaders emerged, such as Cromwell in England, Washington in the United States, and Robespierre, Marat, and Danton in France, to complete the tasks entrusted to them by history. In the era of the proletarian revolution, the leaders and mentors of the proletarian revolution emerged, such as Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. In the revolution led by the Chinese proletariat, Comrade Mao Zedong, such a brilliant leader, was born. Secondly, the social conditions at that time also determined whether a talented person has the possibility of developing his talents and showing his skills. We know that in the old China under the rule of imperialism and its lackeys, many talented people were suffocated and buried by the social system at that time; but in the new China of the people, favorable social conditions are gradually being created so that those who have talents can be cultivated and given the possibility of developing their talents, and thus more and more outstanding figures emerge. That is to say, a person, no matter how smart and talented he is, can never be unrestricted by historical laws and the specific social conditions at that time and can act arbitrarily at will, and no one can "reverse the wheels of history."
    Of course, admitting the inevitability of the emergence of historical figures is not denying chance. For example, under certain circumstances, whether a great figure appears sooner or later, whether it is Zhang San or Li Si, what his talents are, what his personal experiences are... these are all accidental factors that affect the events at that time. Although this accidental factor has some influence on the process of history, it does not play a decisive role in the process of history. The general course of history is determined by necessity. If chance is emphasized, the individual will be regarded as the creator of history.
    However, by what yardstick should we evaluate whether a person's role in history is good or bad, big or small? Marxism-Leninism believes that when analyzing a person, we must study the historical era and specific environment in which this person is located, the class to which he belongs, his life's activities, whether this activity conforms to the laws of social and historical development, whether it promotes and promotes the process of history, or whether it hinders and delays the process of history, whether it represents the interests and wishes of the people, or whether it violates the interests and wishes of the people. Only in this way can we make a correct assessment of historical figures, rather than distorting history. For example, Kang Youwei, led the Hundred Days' Reform sixty years ago, attempting to develop the capitalist system in China without fundamentally changing the feudal system. This proposition was approved and supported by many people at that time. Although Kang Youwei and others were reformists, their activities still had progressive significance under the historical conditions at that time, and therefore were hated by the reactionaries. However, after the failure of this coup, Kang Youwei still stubbornly trusted the Qing Dynasty, extremely hated the peasant movement, and resolutely opposed the revolution. This made him completely degenerate from a reformist with progressive significance into a reactionary and insignificant "royalist" party member. We should view Kang Youwei in this way.
    In short, Hu Shih's historical idealist viewpoint is to despise the people, oppose the revolutionary movement of the people, exaggerate the role of the individual, and regard history as created by outstanding figures. This reactionary viewpoint reflects the nature of the comprador bourgeoisie he represents—hating the people and fearing the people. The purpose of Hu Shih's promotion of this reactionary viewpoint is to deceive, anesthetize, and fool the people, so that imperialism and the comprador bourgeoisie can rule China for a long time. The historical materialist viewpoint is to acknowledge that the main force of social development and the main creator of history is not heroes and leaders, but the people. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history" [23], but also acknowledges that outstanding figures have a significant role in historical development, as long as they can correctly understand the conditions of social development and understand how to change these conditions, they can accelerate the process of history with their own activities and promote the solution of historical tasks. This is the scientific historical view of the most advanced class—the proletariat.
    Since Hu Shih respects and exaggerates the role of the individual, he vigorously promotes selfish individualism and individual heroism. He "teaches" young people not to participate in patriotic movements and revolutionary struggles, but to first "cast themselves into a vessel," cast themselves into an "isolated person," a "person who stands alone"; he advises young people to follow him and make themselves a "true individualist." Others advise young people: "Sacrifice your personal freedom to seek national freedom!" Hu Shih said: "Struggling for your personal freedom is struggling for national freedom!" Some people say "life is like a dream," Hu Shih said: "Even if it is a dream, but you only have this one chance to dream, how can you not...have a hearty and vigorous dream?" Some people say "life is like a play," Hu Shih said: "Even if it is a play, you must play the main role yourself, and not play the role of a 'running dragon'..." [24] In addition, he used "to create a free and independent personality," "save oneself," "egoism," and other sayings and flowery words to lure people away from the patriotic movement of the masses and away from the revolutionary struggle of the people.
    According to the historical materialist viewpoint, since the people are the creators of history, whether it is a revolutionary party or a revolutionary cadre, they must love the people, be loyal to the interests of the people, establish close ties with the people, and constantly consolidate this relationship. To this end, we must be good at listening to the voices of the masses and understanding their urgent demands, and we must humbly learn from the masses—learn honestly. Stalin said in the article "On the shortcomings of party work and the methods of eliminating Trotskyist double-dealers and other double-dealers" that the key to the strength and invincibility of the Bolshevik Party lies in its connection with its mother, that is, with the masses who gave birth, raised, and taught them. Maintaining close ties with the masses is one of the basic experiences of the success of the Soviet Communist Party, and it is also one of the basic experiences of the success of the Chinese Communist Party. The Constitution of the Chinese Communist Party states: "Chinese Communists must have the spirit of serving the Chinese people wholeheartedly, must establish extensive ties with the working masses, peasant masses, and other revolutionary people, and must always pay attention to consolidating and expanding this relationship." Comrade Mao Zedong also taught us in many articles that we must firmly believe that the creativity of the people is infinite, and therefore we must trust the people and rely on the people, become one with the people, never leave the people for a moment, proceed from the interests of the people in everything, and serve the people wholeheartedly.
    According to the historical materialist viewpoint, the great role of outstanding figures in historical development is acknowledged, but the exaggeration of the role of individuals and the idea of ​​personal worship are opposed. Because exaggerating the role of the individual and the idea of ​​personal worship will make people unable to see or underestimate the role of the people, will lead to detachment from the masses in work, and thus embark on an extremely dangerous path; on the other hand, it will stifle the initiative, activity, and creativity of the masses, making the masses not believe in their own strength, but spread a negative mood, thinking that outstanding figures will do everything for them, and the masses do not need to care about national affairs. Therefore, this idea is an extremely harmful idea and has a destructive force for the revolution and the party. We must never educate cadres with the spirit of blind worship and loyalty to individual figures, but should educate cadres with the spirit of loyalty to the party, loyalty to the people, and loyalty to the cause of communism.
    We should point out that criticizing Hu Shih and all other idealists' reactionary views on the role of the people and the individual in history and vigorously promoting the historical materialist viewpoint is of great significance to our current revolutionary practice. Some people say: Whether it is "the times create heroes" or "heroes create the times" is already an "old topic" and has no fresh taste. I think this view is wrong. True, since the national liberation, our party has extensively conducted historical materialist education among the people, so that historical idealism has been hit to a certain extent. But the idea of ​​historical idealism has not disappeared, it still has a vast market, it still spreads a wide range of influence, it still constantly attacks us, and even many party members and cadres have become its prisoners.
      Idealism still maintains a wide and profound influence in the field of academic thought, and dialectical materialism and historical materialism have not yet established a dominant position in all fields of academic thought, we don’t need to say more about this here. Even in our own propaganda work, the systematic propaganda of dialectical materialism and historical materialism in the past has also been very insufficient, the great role of the people in history and the leading role of the party have also been explained very insufficiently, and the role of individuals in history has also been rarely correctly explained. On the contrary, we have consciously or unconsciously spread some ideas that exaggerate the role of individuals and personal worship. Especially in our actual work and in the minds of cadres, there are also some manifestations of underestimating the role of the people and the party, exaggerating the role of individuals, and personal worship. The resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of our party pointed out: "Especially because after the victory of the New Democratic Revolution in China, a part of the cadres in the party have developed an extremely dangerous sense of pride. They are dizzy with the achievements in their work, forgetting the humble attitude and self-criticism spirit that communists must have, exaggerating the role of individuals, emphasizing personal prestige, thinking that they are the best in the world, can only listen to flattery and praise, cannot be criticized and supervised, suppress and retaliate against critics, and even regard the regions and departments they lead as personal capital and independent kingdoms." Is this situation not worthy of our serious vigilance?
    Therefore, while criticizing Hu Shih's historical idealism, we must vigorously promote historical materialism. Conduct ideological education in historical materialism for young people, party members, and cadres, so that they can draw a line between historical materialism and historical idealism, clarify the role of the people in history and the leading role of the party, correctly understand the role of individuals in history, and thus establish a firm mass viewpoint, resolve to follow the mass line, combine their activities with the workers and peasants, and develop a work style of close contact with the masses. At the same time, conduct historical materialist education for the broad masses of the people, improve their political awareness, make them realize their position and role, stimulate their initiative and creativity, give full play to their great potential, and actively participate in the cause of socialist construction with the attitude of masters, so as to accelerate the process of history.

    关于人民群众和个人在历史上的作用问题，在社会学和历史学的领域中是一个很重要的问题。在许多剥削阶级的学者中极为广泛地流行着这样一种错误观点，认为历史是由个别杰出人物，即所谓英雄、豪杰、帝王、将相创造的，人民群众都是盲目地跟着他们走的，是他们可以任意摆布的。照他们的意见，历史好像是一块泥土，杰出人物可以随意把它捏成什么样子。照他们的意见，过去历史上的国家兴亡，朝代更替，一切伟大革命事变的发生和社会制度的变革，都是英雄伟人活动的结果。这就是说“英雄造时势”，“英雄即历史”。这是一种唯心主义的历史观。例如我国的梁启超就认为“历史为少数伟大人物之产儿”，他说：“试思中国全部历史，如失一孔子、失一秦始皇、失一汉武帝……其局面当如何？”〔一〕再例如俄国的民粹派，把人民群众称为“群氓”，认为“群氓”应等待“英雄”建立丰功伟绩，“群氓”不能做出什么有组织的活动，只能盲目地跟着“英雄”走。因此，民粹派就拒绝在农民和工人阶级中进行群众的革命工作，而专门从事个人恐怖的斗争手段。
    资产阶级的学者以这种观点来研究社会生活和历史事件时，就把重心放在历史中个别人物的活动上，只去考察历史人物行动的思想动机，而不能揭露这些动机的物质基础，所以就不能发现社会发展的客观规律，也就不能正确地理解人民群众和个人在历史上的作用问题。
    在人类历史上，只有马克思和恩格斯，才第一次给社会生活和历史以彻底的唯物主义的解释，发现了社会发展的规律，正确地指出了人民群众和个人在历史发展中的作用。
      胡适是实用主义的信徒。实用主义是美国资产阶级的一种最反动的哲学思想，它和欧洲的马赫主义、经验批判论等，都是属于帝国主义时期资产阶级最腐朽的主观唯心论的思想。胡适是以实用主义来考察、研究社会生活和历史事件的，于是就把重心放在个别人物的活动上，他根本不了解社会发展的物质基础和客观规律。例如他在“惨痛的回忆与反省”这篇文章中就明明白白地告诉我们说：中国六七十年的历史所以“一事无成”，中国民族的自救运动所以失败的“最主要的原因”，就是缺乏一个社会政治的重心。什么是社会的重心呢？他认为：“帝制时代的重心应该在帝室”，中国在十九世纪后期的重心是“曾国藩李鸿章诸人”，后来
  “戊戍的维新领袖也曾轰动一时，几乎有造成新重心的形势”“辛亥以后国民党的领袖几乎成为社会新重心了，但旧势力不久卷土重来，而革命日子太浅，革命的领袖还不能得着全国的信仰，所以这个新重心不久也崩溃了。……”从此，我们可以明显地看出胡适的历史唯心主义的反动观点。
    胡适对于社会生活和历史的理解，简直是荒谬绝伦的。马克思列宁主义认为，人类社会和动物的生活是有根本区别的，可是胡适却说：“人不过是动物的一种，他和别种动物只有程度的差异，并无种类的区别。”〔二〕这样他就把人类的生活贬低到动物的地位。胡适还把达尔文进化论中关于生物的逐渐演进的思想，用来解释人类社会的发展过程，说“世界是一点一滴一分一毫的长成的”〔三〕，只有量的增加，而并无质的改变，来否认社会的革命式的发展。这是一种形而上学的发展观——庸俗进化论。马克思列宁主义认为，社会生活和自然现象都是有规律地发展的，是不依人的意志为转移的，而胡适却说：“实在是一个很服从的女孩子，他百依百顺的由我们替他涂抹起来，装扮起来。‘实在好比一块大理石到了我们手里，由我们雕成什么像’”〔四〕。这就是说，胡适认为历史是可以由人的主观意志随便加以“制造”的，是不受任何客观条件限制的，并无什么规律可言的。至于历史这个 “女孩子”由谁来装扮，这块“大理石”由谁来雕刻呢？不言而喻，他指的当然不是人民群众而是个别杰出人物了。
      胡适以这些错误的、混乱的观点来观察和研究历史，不仅不能了解历史的发展规律，而且会陷入滑稽可笑的地步。例如他说：“从我们实用主义者的眼光看来，从我的历史眼光看来，政治上的历史是红楼梦上说的‘不是东风压了西风，便是西风压了东风’。”〔五〕“自秦始皇以来，二千多年的历史，确然呈现一种‘合久必分，分久必合’的大势。”〔六〕一九三○年胡适在分析中国社会时，竟认为在中国既没有资本主义和资产阶级，也没有什么帝国主义，至于“封建制度早已在二千年前崩坏了”，中国的贫弱，不过是由于“五鬼”〔七〕。……如此等等荒谬的言论，这都是今天一般中学生都可以看出来的了。
      关于人民群众和个人在历史上的作用问题，是关于人类社会发展规律的一般学说中的一个问题。不管胡适在许多文章中经常高唱着什么“科学的方法”和“历史的态度”，可是由于他不理解社会发展的原因和规律，把历史的重心放在个别人物的活动上，所以他也就不可能正确地理解人民群众和个人在历史上的作用问题。二
    在胡适的眼中，人民群众是愚昧无知的，是附和盲动的，是阿斗，是奴才，是贫穷、疾病的化身，并且是没有什么力量的。例如他有意识地歪曲和利用易卜生的思想，表示轻视群众而只重视个人和少数人，宣传资产阶级的个人主义，散播轻视人民革命的邪恶的思想。他在许多文章里甚至这样公开地说：“在这个猪仔世界里，民众固不用谈起，组织也不可靠……”〔八〕。“一个新社会，新国家，总是一些爱自由爱真理的人造成的，决不是一般奴才造成的。”〔九〕在一九二五年的“五卅”运动之后，他针对着这个轰轰烈烈的运动这样说：
  “群众运动总是不能持久的。这并非中国人的‘虎头蛇尾’，‘五分钟的热度’。这是世界人类的通病。所谓‘民气’，所谓‘群众运动’，都只是一时的大问题刺激起来的一种感情上的反应。”“我们可以断定民众运动的牺牲的大部分是白白地糟蹋了的。”（着重点是胡适加的）〔十〕
    应当指出，胡适不仅仅是轻视人民群众，而且是非常仇视和反对人民群众的革命运动的。大家都知道，他是反对以革命的办法来根本解决社会问题，而主张一点一滴的改良的。他曾经“很诚恳地宣言”：“宁可不避‘反革命’之名”，来反共产党领导的人民革命运动。事实亦是如此，他在许多文章中曾用一些最恶毒的言语来讥讽和咒骂人民群众的革命运动。例如：他把“种种革命”行动都认为是“浪费精力”，是“煽动盲动残忍的劣根性”，是“扰乱社会国家的安宁”；他把组织工人和学生运动都诬蔑为“盲从、轻信、武断”，是“浅薄的煽惑”，是“少数人的把持操纵”；在抗日战争中，他甚至大骂当时英勇卓绝坚持敌后游击战争的人民军队为“土匪”……。
    关于人民群众在历史上的作用问题，马克思列宁主义者的看法完全是和胡适相反的。
    马克思列宁主义者认为，人民群众有无限的智慧和伟大的创造力，是一切社会物质财富的创造者，是社会命运和各种革命斗争的决定者。世界历史是由人民群众创造的。
    正像达尔文发现了生物界的发展规律一样，马克思和恩格斯发现了人类社会的发展规律。在马克思、恩格斯看来，归根到底，决定社会发展的不是什么杰出人物的愿望和观念，而是社会生存物质条件的发展，是社会生存所必需的物质资料的生产，是生产方式（包括生产力和生产关系）的变更。大家知道，人类在从事于政治、科学和艺术等等活动之前，首先必须吃饭、穿衣和住房子，可是为了获得这些物质资料，人类便必须进行劳动生产。因此，社会历史首先是生产发展、生产方式更替的历史、同时也就是物质资料生产者本身的历史，即身为生产过程中的基本力量的劳动群众的历史，各国人民的历史。
    人民群众在政治方面也是最后决定社会命运的力量。马克思主义证明，迄今存在的全部人类历史
  （原始共产社会除外）都是阶级斗争的历史。阶级斗争是社会发展的原动力，革命是历史的火车头。从一种生产方式过渡到另一种生产方式，只有经过阶级斗争才能实现。一种社会制度被另一种更高级的社会制度所代替，只有经过革命才能发生，革命乃是阶级斗争最尖锐的形式。这就是说，在阶级社会中，人民群众的斗争，被压迫被剥削的阶级反对他们的压迫者和剥削者的斗争，例如奴隶反对奴隶主的斗争，农民反对地主的斗争，无产阶级反对资产阶级的斗争等，是历史发展的基本内容和主要动力。历史上每次革命最基本的、决定的、主要的力量是人民群众。特别是在革命时期和解放战争的年代里，千百万群众组织起来积极参加斗争的时候，人民群众的伟大力量表现得更为明显。列宁说过：
  “民众在其他任何时候都不如革命时期这样能表现为新社会制度底积极创造者。在这样的时期，人民能够作出从市侩渐进主义狭小眼光看来是不可思议的奇迹。”〔十一〕
    就是在精神文化的领域中，人民群众也起着巨大的作用。这不仅是因为人们在从事精神文化活动时，首先要依靠人民的劳动才能有维持生活的物质资料，而且人民的生活和创造力，也是一切诗人、作家和学者们的智慧和灵感的源泉。语言是人民创造的。许多伟大的史诗、歌曲和神话也都是人民创造的。一切伟大的文学艺术作品都与人民有密切的联系，都是人民的思想和生活的反映。毛泽东同志说：“人民生活中本来存在着文学艺术原料的矿藏，……它们是一切文学艺术的取之不尽、用之不竭的唯一的源泉。”〔十二〕一切科学的发明，都是由于当时广大劳动群众在生产和生活上的需要，而且这种发明之所以有可能，也是当时人民的生产和斗争提供了条件。高尔基说：“人民不但是创造一切物质价值的力量，同时也是精神价值唯一而无穷的源泉……。”〔十三〕
    特别应当指出，人民群众在社会主义革命和社会主义建设时代的作用是大大地加强了。本来，当共产党建立之后，人民群众在共产党的领导和指导之下，不断提高觉悟性和组织性，其作用就日益加强。可是，历史证明，社会改革越深入，参加改革的群众也就越广泛越积极。到了社会主义革命和社会主义建设时代，将有比从前任何革命都多得多的群众参加到革命斗争中来，并高度发挥主动性、积极性和创造性，来摆脱各种各样的剥削和建设人民自己当家作主的生活，人民群众那种在旧社会受到压制的创造力将被解放出来，而得到充分的发挥。人民群众在共产党的领导下，在自觉地创造自己的历史。苏联十月革命成功和建成社会主义社会的光辉历史证明了这一点。我国五年来各种经济、政治和文化建设的蓬蓬勃勃的发展亦证明了这一点。斯大林说过：“把领袖看作唯一的历史创造者，而把工人和农民看得一钱不值的那种时候，是早已过去了。现在民族和国家底命运不只是由领袖来决定，而首先和主要是由千百万劳动群众来决定的。工人和农民埋头苦干，毫不声张地建设工厂和制造厂，建设矿井和铁路，建设集体农庄和苏维埃农庄，创造一切生活品，把衣食供给全世界，——这就是真正的英雄和新生活的创造者。”〔十四〕三
    对于个人在历史上的作用，胡适则是推崇备至。他认为历史是由“优秀人才”创造的。例如他说，美洲共和国是华盛顿造成的，华盛顿“替历史开一新纪元”。日本一个小岛国为什么“居然在半个世纪之内一跃而为世界三五大强国之一”？他认为这是由伊藤博文、大久保利通、西乡隆盛等几十个人努力的结果。胡适甚至把个别人物渲染上神秘的色彩，把他们的作用夸张到荒诞离奇的地步，认为他们不受历史发展规律的支配，可以随心所欲地创造和改变一切。例如他说：“他吐一口痰在地上，也许可以毁灭一村一族。他起一个念头，也许可以引起几十年的血战。他也许‘一言可以兴邦，一言可以丧邦。’”〔十五〕“一个错误的政治或社会改造的会议都可以引起几百年的杀人流血。”〔十六〕胡适这些言论，不仅是夸张个人的作用，宣传个人崇拜的思想，而且是把社会的发展当作是一些偶然性的堆积，毫无规律性可言。
    既然胡适认为历史是由“优秀人物”创造的，而不是人民群众创造的，所以他便把“救国”和“改造社会”的希望寄托在“优秀人物”的身上，特别是寄托在优秀的知识分子的身上。当胡适“分析”了中国社会而认为“五鬼”是“我们革命的真正对象”之后，便说打倒这五大敌人的真革命只有一条路：“就是认清了我们的敌人，认清了我们的问题，集合全国的人才智力，充分采用世界的科学知识与方法，一步一步的作自觉的改革，在自觉的指导之下一点一滴的收不断的改革之全功。”（着重点是胡适加的）〔十七〕这种依靠“优秀人才”用“自觉的改革”的方法，是胡适用来代替革命的方法，也是他自称为改造社会的根本态度和根本方法。所以胡适便主张救国要“从思想学问下手”〔十八〕，处置军阀“只有充分养成文治势力”〔十九〕，建立社会重心“必须能吸收容纳国中的优秀人才”〔二十〕，并且提倡“好人政府”，宣传“教育救国”，对于封建统治的奴才武训则赞扬备至，对于办大学训练“领袖人物”则谈得津津有味……。
    至于人物的评价问题，在胡适看来也是没有什么客观标准的。例如他说：“二十年前，康有为是洪水猛兽一般的维新党。现在康有为变成老古董了。康有为并不曾变换，估价的人变了，故他的价值也跟着变了。”〔二十一〕既然如此，一个人物在历史上的作用，是好是坏，是大是小，也就很难有什么准确的尺度了。既然如此，所以胡适便可以胡乱地说：墨子、韩非是“实用主义者”，王莽是一个“社会主义者”，秦桧是一个“有功”之臣，曾国藩等是
  “中兴”将相……。
    关于个人在历史上的作用问题，马克思列宁主义者的看法也是和胡适完全不同的。
    马克思列宁主义虽然承认人民群众在历史上的决定作用，虽然也绝不否认个人在历史发展中的作用，但是却反对夸大个人的作用和个人崇拜的思想。
    不错，马克思列宁主义证明，社会发展是有规律的，存在着历史必然性；但是马克思列宁主义亦认为，社会现象是在人的活动的基础上发生的，历史过程不是离开人而是由于人的活动而完成的。所以人的活动、意识、意志绝不等于零，而在历史上起一定的作用，发生一定的影响。这个作用和影响的大小，是取决于某一历史人物预见事变和影响群众的能力、活动的规模以及意志是否坚强等。
    一个历史人物，如果能按照社会发展的规律，善于把他的愿望、观念、活动和先进阶级的斗争联系起来，为人民群众的切身利益而奋斗，他就能起卓越的作用，即促进和加速历史的进程。反之，如果一个历史人物妄想违反社会发展的规律，把自己的活动和反动阶级的利益结合起来，对抗先进阶级的斗争，胡作非为，企图开倒车，那他就要被历史的车轮所碾碎。例如蒋介石、胡适等等人民的公敌已被历史车轮所碾碎就是最好的例证。斯大林在“与德国作家路德维希的谈话”中说过：“马克思主义决不否认卓越人物底作用，并不否认历史是由人们创造的。……但是人们创造历史，当然不是按照什么幻想，不是随心所欲。凡是新的一代都碰到早在他们诞生时候即已具备的特定的条件。伟大人物之所以有一些什么价值，只是因为他们善于正确了解这些条件、了解如何改变这些条件。如果他们不了解这些条件，而想按照自己的幻想来改变这些条件，那么他们，这些人，就会陷入唐·吉诃德底境地。”
    因此，我们绝不能轻视杰出人物的作用。人民群众的斗争，先进的政党，都需要有自己的领袖。因为这种领袖比一般人看得远，有经验，能代表大多数人的利益，能领导群众进行斗争。特别是工人阶级的斗争，要消灭一切剥削和阶级，不但解放自己而且要解放全人类，为此就要求自己有高度的觉悟性和组织性，有正确而灵活的战略和策略，那当然更需要有自己的政党和领袖。列宁说：“谁也知道，在大多数情形下，至少是在现代文明国家内，阶级通常是由政党来领导的；政党通常是由最有威信、最有影响、最有经验、被选出担任最负责职务而称为领袖的人们所组成的多少固定的集团来主持的。”〔二十二〕像马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林等这些工人阶级最杰出、最伟大的领袖和导师，能正确地了解社会发展的规律和阶级斗争的规律，对人民群众有无限的热爱和忠诚，具有钢铁般的意志和大无畏的精神……他们对世界历史的作用和伟大贡献，那是可想而知的。
    必须严格指出，我们承认杰出人物、英雄和领袖的作用，我们衷心地拥护和热爱人民自己的领袖，并对那些在历史上起过进步作用的人物也给予不同程度的赞扬和歌颂，但是，这与胡适之流的唯心论者过分夸大个人的作用、宣传盲目的个人崇拜毫无相同之处。马克思列宁主义认为：首先，英雄、伟大人物的出现并不是纯粹偶然的，而是有一定的必然性的。这种必然性就在于，当历史发展到一定阶段时，特别是在革命变革的时代，历史提出新的任务，需要有人来领导人民群众解决这个历史任务时，这就会出现一些适当的领袖人物。例如在资产阶级革命时代，就出现了资产阶级的革命领袖，像英国的克伦威尔，美国的华盛顿，法国的罗伯斯庇尔、马拉和丹敦等，来完成历史所赋与他们的任务。在无产阶级革命时代，就出现了无产阶级革命的领袖和导师，像马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林。在中国无产阶级领导的革命中，就产生了毛泽东同志这样英明的领袖。其次，当时的社会条件，也决定着一个有才干的人物是否有发展其才能和大显身手的可能。我们知道，在帝国主义及其走狗统治下的旧中国，有许多有才能的人，都被当时的社会制度所窒息、所埋藏了；可是在人民的新中国，逐渐创造着有利的社会条件，使那些有才干的人能得到培养和施展其才能的可能，于是便有越来越多的优秀人物涌现。这就是说，一个人物，不管他有多大的聪明和才智，绝不能不受历史规律和当时的具体社会条件的限制而能随心所欲地任意行动，任何人都不能“去倒转历史的车轮”。
    当然，承认历史人物出现的必然性，也并不是否认偶然性。例如在一定的时势下面，一个伟大人物出现的迟早，是张三还是李四，他的才能如何，他个人的遭遇怎样……这都是影响当时事变的偶然因素。这种偶然因素虽然对历史的进程有所影响，但对历史的进程不起决定作用。历史总的进程是由必然性来决定的。如果强调了偶然性，就会把个人看作是历史的创造者了。
    可是，一个人物在历史上的作用，是好是坏，是大是小，究竟以什么尺度来评价呢？马克思列宁主义认为，在分析一个人物时，必须研究这个人物所处的历史时代和具体环境，他所属的阶级，他一生的活动，这种活动是否符合社会历史发展的规律，是促进和推动了历史的进程，还是阻挠和延缓了历史的进程，是代表了人民群众的利益和愿望，还是违反人民群众的利益和愿望。只有这样，才能对历史人物作出正确的估价，而不是歪曲历史。例如康有为，在六十年以前领导戊戌政变，企图使中国不根本改变封建制度而可以发展资本主义制度。这种主张在当时受到了许多人的赞成和拥护。康有为等人虽然是改良派，但在当时的历史条件下，他们的活动还是有进步意义的，因此受到了反动派的仇视。可是这次政变失败以后，康有为还是固执地信赖满清皇朝，极端仇恨农民运动，坚决反对革命。这就使他从一个有进步意义的改良主义者，完全堕落为一个反动的渺小的“保皇党”党员。我们对于康有为这个人物就应当这样看。四
    总之，胡适的历史唯心主义的观点，是轻视人民群众，反对人民群众的革命运动，夸大个人的作用，把历史当作是杰出人物创造的。这种反动的观点，正是反映了他所代表的买办资产阶级的本性——憎恨人民、害怕人民。胡适宣传这种反动观点的目的，正是为了欺骗、麻醉和愚弄人民群众，使帝国主义和买办资产阶级等能长期统治中国。历史唯物主义的观点，是承认社会发展的主要力量、历史的主要创造者并不是什么英雄和领袖，而是人民群众。毛泽东同志说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”〔二十三〕，但同时也承认杰出人物在历史发展中有重大的作用，只要他们能正确了解社会发展条件和了解如何改变这些条件的时候，就能以自己的活动加速历史的进程，促进历史任务的解决。这是最先进的阶级——无产阶级的科学的历史观。
    胡适既然推崇和夸大个人的作用，所以他便大力宣传自私自利的个人主义和个人英雄主义。他“教导”青年们不要参加爱国运动和革命斗争，首先要
  “把自己铸造成器”，铸造成为一个“孤立的人”、
  “特立独行之士”；他劝告青年们要跟着他走，把自己造成一个“真正的个人主义者”。别人劝青年们说：“牺牲你们个人的自由，去求国家的自由！”胡适却说：“争你们个人的自由，便是为国家争自由！”有的人说“人生如梦”，胡适就说：“就算是一场梦罢，可是你只有这一个做梦的机会，岂可不……做一个痛痛快快轰轰烈烈的梦？”有的人说
  “人生如戏”，胡适就说：就是做戏罢，自己也要演个主角，不要扮做“跑龙套”的……。〔二十四〕此外，他还用“要造成自由独立的人格”、“救出自己”、“为我主义”等说法和花言巧语，来引诱人们脱离群众的爱国运动，脱离人民的革命斗争。
    根据历史唯物主义的观点，既然人民群众是历史的创造者，所以不论一个革命政党也好，不论一个革命干部也好，都要热爱人民群众，都要忠于人民群众的利益，和人民群众发生密切的联系，并经常巩固这种联系。为此，就要善于倾听群众的呼声和了解他们的迫切要求，就要虚心地向群众学习——老老实实地学习。斯大林在“论党工作底缺点和消灭托洛茨基两面分子及其他两面分子的办法”这篇文章中曾讲了一个希腊神话安泰的故事之后说，布尔什维克党之所以强而有力和不可战胜的关键，就在于它与自己的母亲，即是与生育、抚养并把他们教导出来的群众保持着联系。与群众保持密切联系，这是苏联共产党成功的基本经验之一，也是中国共产党成功的基本经验之一。中国共产党的党章中这样写道：“中国共产党人必须具有全心全意为中国人民服务的精神，必须与工人群众、农民群众及其他革命人民建立广泛的联系，并经常注意巩固与扩大这种联系。”毛泽东同志在许多文章中也都教导我们说，要坚决相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而要信任人民和依靠人民，和人民打成一片，一刻也不脱离人民，一切从人民的利益出发，全心全意地为人民服务。
    根据历史唯物主义的观点，承认杰出人物在历史发展中的重大作用，但是却反对夸大个人的作用，反对个人崇拜的思想。因为夸大个人的作用和个人崇拜的思想，就会看不见或轻视人民群众的作用，就会在工作中脱离群众，从而走上极危险的道路；另一方面就会扼杀群众的主动性、积极性和创造性，使群众不相信自己的力量，而是散布一种消极情绪，以为杰出人物会把一切替他们做好，群众毋须关心国家大事。所以说这种思想是极有害的思想，对革命、对党都是具有破坏力的思想。我们绝不能以盲目的崇拜和忠于个别人物的精神来教育干部，而应当以忠于党、忠于人民和忠于共产主义事业的精神来教育干部。
    我们应当指出，批判胡适和其他一切唯心论者关于人民群众和个人在历史上的作用问题的反动观点，大力宣传历史唯物主义的观点，对我们当前的革命实践是富有重大意义的。有的人说：是“时势造英雄”还是“英雄造时势”，这已是“老生常谈”的问题了，没有什么新鲜味道。我以为这种看法是错误的。不错，自全国解放以后，我们党曾向
  人民广泛地进行了历史唯物主义的教育，使得历史
  唯心主义受到了一定的打击。但是历史唯心主义的思想并没有销声匿迹，它还有广大的市场，它还散
  布着广泛的影响，它还不断向我们进攻，甚至有不
  少党员和干部竟做了它的俘虏。
      唯心主义在学术思想领域中还保持着广泛而深刻的影响，辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义还没有在一切学术思想领域中建立统治地位，我们这里不必多说。就是在我们自己的宣传工作中，过去对辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义的系统的宣传也是很不够的，对人民群众在历史上的伟大作用、对党的领导作用也是阐述得很不够的，对个人在历史上的作用也很少进行正确的解释，相反的，还自觉地或不觉地散播了一些夸大个人作用和个人崇拜的思想。特别是在我们的实际工作中和干部思想中，也有一些轻视人民群众的作用和党的作用、夸大个人的作用和个人崇拜的表现。我们党的七届四中全会的决议中曾指出：“特别是由于在中国新民主主义革命胜利后，党内一部分干部滋长着一种极端危险的骄傲情绪，他们因为工作中的若干成绩就冲昏了头脑，忘记了共产党员所必须具有的谦逊态度和自我批评精神，夸大个人的作用，强调个人的威信，自以为天下第一，只能听人奉承赞扬，不能受人批评监督，对批评者实行压制和报复，甚至把自己所领导的地区和部门看作个人的资本和独立王国。”这种情况，难道不值得我们严重警惕吗？
    因此，在批判胡适的历史唯心主义的同时，我们要大力宣传历史唯物主义。对青年、对党员、对干部进行历史唯物主义的思想教育，使他们划清历史唯物主义与历史唯心主义的界限，明确人民群众在历史上的作用和党的领导作用，正确了解个人在历史上的作用，从而树立坚强的群众观点，决心走群众路线，把自己的活动与工农群众结合起来，养成密切联系群众的工作作风。同时，对广大人民群众进行历史唯物主义的教育，提高他们的政治觉悟，使他们认识到自己的地位和作用，激发他们的主动性和创造性，发挥巨大的潜在力，以主人翁的态度积极参加社会主义的建设事业，来加速历史的进程。
