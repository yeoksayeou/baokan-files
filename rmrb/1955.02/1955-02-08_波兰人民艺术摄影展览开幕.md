The "Polish People's Art Photography Exhibition," sponsored by the Bureau for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, officially opened on February 6th at the waterside pavilion in Zhongshan Park, Beijing. The 297 photographic works on display were selected from the Polish National Art Photography Exhibition. These works not only showcase the achievements of Polish photographic art in terms of modeling and expressive methods, but also, due to the breadth of the subject matter, reflect the production and construction, natural scenery, and the people's lives in the People's Republic of Poland.

In less than two days since the opening, more than 4,000 people have visited the exhibition. Many viewers praised these beautiful and ideologically rich works in the guestbook.

The "Polish People's Art Photography Exhibition" will be sent to other cities in China for exhibition after it concludes in Beijing on March 6th.

    波兰人民艺术摄影展览开幕
    对外文化联络局主办的“波兰人民艺术摄影展览”已于二月六日在北京中山公园水榭正式开幕展出。这次展出的二百九十七幅摄影作品都是从波兰全国艺术摄影展览会中选出的，这些作品不仅显示了波兰摄影艺术在造型和表现方法上所获得的成就，而且由于题材的广泛，因此也反映了波兰人民共和国的生产建设、自然风物和人民生活的面貌。
    展出不到两天，已有四千多人前往参观，许多观众在留言中都赞扬了这些优美的富有思想内容的作品。　　“波兰人民艺术摄影展览”于三月六日在北京结束后还将送往国内其他城市展出。
