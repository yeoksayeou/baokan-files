Since this newspaper published the decision of the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association to expel Kong Jue from membership and the exposé by a reporter from Wenyi Bao of Kong Jue's vile behavior on February 16th, many readers have expressed infinite indignation at Kong Jue's moral depravity and vile character. They have written letters requesting that this morally degenerate element be severely dealt with and suggesting that literary and art circles learn a lesson from this, strengthen moral education for literary and art workers, and resolutely fight against all phenomena of moral degeneration. Excerpts from some of the letters are published below:

(I) Editor:

We read the article "Please Look at Kong Jue's Vile Behavior" published in the People's Daily on February 16th and felt extremely indignant. The vile behavior of this degenerate is lawless. His evil deeds not only prove that he is a thoroughly rotten fellow; they also prove that he has unscrupulously disrupted our social order, undermined the construction of our sacred literary and art cause, and challenged the people's laws. This is absolutely intolerable! We fully support the decision of the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association to expel this degenerate from membership in the Writers Association. We also suggest that the People's Court impose legal sanctions on this degenerate element who violates laws and disrupts discipline!

We believe that it is also entirely necessary for literary and art circles to deeply learn a lesson from this incident and strengthen moral education for literary and art workers.

(II) Editor:

We felt incredibly angry after reading the exposé by the Wenyi Bao reporter of Kong Jue's vile behavior.

Who would have thought that this so-called "writer" Kong Jue was originally a licentious, shameless, morally degenerate, and thoroughly rotten rogue.

How can anyone imagine that such a morally corrupt and deeply dirty despicable fellow could write about any positive characters? Our literary and art ranks must not tolerate such corrupt and degenerate people, and the Chinese people will never allow someone like Kong Jue to tarnish the honorary title of people's writer. Therefore, the decision of the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association to expel Kong Jue from membership is entirely correct.

As far as I know, among the members of the Chinese Writers Association, there is more than one person like Kong Jue who plays with women and is morally degenerate, only to varying degrees. The Writers Association should pay serious attention to this: it must be determined to continue to purge those morally degenerate elements who repeatedly refuse to be reformed, and must not tolerate evil and leave behind future troubles. Zhang Ji

(III) Editor:

In the past, I had read "New Heroes and Heroines" more than once, and at the same time, I had a deep admiration for the author. After I saw the ugly behavior of this author exposed in the newspaper, I realized that Kong Jue was a despicable and decadent person. During the Anti-Japanese War, the people behind enemy lines fought hard and risked their lives with the enemy in order to defend the motherland and the people, but Kong Jue took advantage of his work to rape a married woman and his landlord's daughter. Is this humane behavior! In the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, the people of our country fought side by side with the Korean people with full enthusiasm, but Kong Jue, this rogue, trampled on our most beloved female comrades on the battlefield filled with artillery fire. Is this something that a person with blood should do! Writers are engineers of the human soul, and Chinese literary and art circles must not allow such morally corrupt people to mix in. We demand that bad people and bad deeds continue to be exposed, so that our ranks will always be pure and combat-effective. Chang Le

(IV) Editor:

Kong Jue, the author of "New Heroes and Heroines," what a resounding name! Who would have thought that he was originally a shameless and morally degenerate element. I read the Writers Association's decision to expel him from membership, and I fully support this decision.

Now, there are still some people who regard the issue of corruption and degeneration as a minor matter of life and do not feel ashamed. They often use the "screen" of "unrelated to politics" to cover up their private lives and use the fallacy of "private life should not be interfered with" to "defend" themselves. In this way, bourgeois ideology has gained a wide market here, and serious morally degenerate people have committed licentious and shameless crimes under this "screen" and "defense." This is intolerable! Ma Xueliang

(V) Editor:

From the article "Wenyi Bao" reporter exposing Kong Jue's rogue and vile behavior published in the People's Daily on February 16th, if we measure it with the standard of the people's law, his behavior has constituted a crime. Below, I will analyze only two criminal facts within 1954:

Kong Jue's rape of an eighteen-year-old female cadre he met on the train, from the perspective of the consequences of the harm, the first victim was the female cadre, who was defiled under Kong Jue's material enticement and deception, and later "dumped," inevitably suffered great mental pain; later, she left revolutionary work and suffered certain political losses; this is directly related to Kong Jue's various deceptive means. Therefore, Kong Jue has the conditions to be held criminally responsible for the crime of seduction and rape.

In Kong Jue's criminal fact of deceiving another female student, there is also a violation of Article 2 of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, attempting bigamy. Because the behavior objectively manifested in this criminal fact, such as repeatedly promoting that the female student loved him to the point of fanaticism, saying that she hoped to "change her surname to Kong" and was willing to "work, study, and live together" with Kong Jue and his wife, "coexist peacefully," "never be jealous," and begging his wife bitterly for "mercy" and "kowtowing with blood," etc., his criminal motive and purpose are very obvious. His motive was to satisfy his base and shameless lust, and he used the above-mentioned rogue deception to try to obtain his wife's consent in order to cohabit with this female student. Although he was exposed and failed to achieve his ultimate goal, he made a series of preparatory acts intending to commit bigamy. If we add the two crimes in 1954 and the crime of seduction and rape committed on the Korean battlefield in 1951, we can certainly say that he is a "recidivist." This shows that Kong Jue, this "writer" who is spurned by the people, is seriously dangerous to society, and from the perspective of criminal law, he should be given a heavier sentence.

Based on the above two points alone, Kong Jue's criminal behavior has indeed harmed the social relations and social order of our country during the period of socialist transition and violated the people's laws. He should be severely judged by the people's law.

    清除文艺界的道德堕落分子
    二月十六日本报刊载了中国作家协会主席团开除孔厥会籍的决议和文艺报记者对孔厥的丑恶行为的揭露以后，很多读者对孔厥的道德堕落和恶劣品质表示无限愤慨，纷纷来信要求严肃处理这个道德堕落分子，并建议文艺界接受教训，加强对文艺工作者的道德教育工作，坚决和一切道德堕落现象作斗争。现选摘一部分来信发表如下：
    （一）编辑同志：
    我们读了二月十六日人民日报刊载的“请看看孔厥的丑恶行为”一文，感到十分的愤慨。孔厥这个败类的丑恶行为是无法无天的。他的恶行不仅证明他已经是个腐烂透顶的家伙；也证明他曾经无所忌惮地破坏我们的社会秩序，败坏我们神圣的文艺事业的建设，向人民的法律挑衅，这是绝对不能容忍的！我们完全拥护中国作家协会主席团的决定：开除这个败类的作家协会会籍。并且建议人民法院对于这个违法乱纪的堕落分子予以法律制裁！
    我们认为文艺界深刻接受这一事例的教训，加强对文艺工作者的道德教育的工作，也是完全必要的。

　郗潭封许光远　沈彭年　孙志达　吴静
    （二）编辑同志：
    我们读了文艺报记者揭露的孔厥的丑恶行为之后感到无比的气愤。
    想不到这位号称“作家”的孔厥原来是一个荒淫无耻，品质恶劣，腐烂透顶的流氓分子。
    像这样一个道德败坏，灵魂深处肮脏透顶的下流家伙，谁能设想在他的笔下能写出什么正面人物来呢？我们文艺队伍里决不能容留这样腐化堕落的人，中国人民也决不容许像孔厥这样的人玷污人民作家的荣誉称号。所以中国作家协会主席团决定开除孔厥会籍是完全正确的。
    据我了解，在中国作家协会的会员中类似孔厥这样玩弄女性、道德堕落的人还不止一个，只是程度不同而已。这里值得作家协会严重注意的是：必须下定决心，继续清除那些道德堕落屡教不改的分子，千万不能姑息养痈，遗留祸害。  张　击
    （三）编辑同志：
    过去我不止一次地读过“新儿女英雄传”，同时我对作者留下了深厚的爱慕。当我看到报上揭发的这位作者的丑恶行为以后，我才知道孔厥是一个卑鄙腐朽的人。在抗日战争的年代，敌后人民为了保卫祖国保卫人民，在出生入死地和敌人作艰苦斗争，而孔厥这个人竟乘着工作之便奸污了有夫之妇和房东的女儿，难道这是具有人性的行为吗！在抗美援朝战争中，我国人民以满腔热血和朝鲜人民并肩作战，而孔厥这个流氓分子却在炮火连天的战场上糟踏了我们最可爱的女同志，请问这是有血性的人应做的事吗！作家是人类灵魂的工程师，中国文艺界决不容许这样道德败坏的人混在里面。我们要求继续揭发坏人坏事，让我们的队伍永远是纯洁的有战斗力的。常乐
    （四）编辑同志：
    孔厥，“新儿女英雄传”的作者，这是一个多么响亮的名字啊！谁料到他原来是一个无耻的道德上的堕落分子，我阅读了作家协会开除他会籍的决议，我完全拥护这个决议。
    现在，还有一些人把腐化堕落的问题当做生活小节，不以为耻。他们往往把私人生活用“与政治无关”的“布幔”加以掩盖，并且用“私人生活不容干涉”的谬论加以“保卫”，这样，资产阶级思想就在这里取得了广泛的市场，严重的道德上的堕落人物也在这个“布幔”和“保卫”下干出荒淫无耻的罪行。这是不能容忍的！ 马学亮
    （五）编辑同志：
    从二月十六日人民日报所发表的“文艺报”记者揭发孔厥流氓丑恶行为的一文里，我们以人民法律的尺度来衡量一下，他的行为已构成了犯罪，下面仅就一九五四年内两件犯罪事实来分析一下：
    孔厥对在火车上认识的十八岁女干部的奸污行为，从危害的结果上来看，首先受害的女干部，在孔厥的物质引诱和欺骗下被玷污，后来又遭到“甩开”，必然精神上有很大痛苦；以后，她脱离革命工作，在政治上遭受一定的损失；这是与孔厥种种欺骗手段有直接的因果关系的，因此孔厥已具备应负诱奸罪刑事责任的条件。
    在孔厥欺骗另一个女学生的犯罪事实里，同时存在着违反中华人民共和国婚姻法第二条企图重婚的违法行为。因为从这项犯罪事实里客观上所表现的行为如：再三宣传女学生爱他爱到狂热的程度，说她希望“改姓孔”，愿意和孔厥夫妇“一起工作、学习、生活”，“和平共处”，“绝不吃醋”，向他的妻子苦苦哀求“饶命”、“泣血顿首”，等等方面来分析，他的犯罪动机和目的是非常明显的。他的动机是为了满足卑鄙无耻的淫欲，而运用上述流氓欺骗手段企图取得自己妻子同意以达到同这个女学生同居的目的。虽然被揭发未能最终达到目的，但他作了一系列意图重婚的预备行为。我们从一九五四年两次和一九五一年在朝鲜战场上所犯那次诱奸罪行加起来，肯定他是一个“再犯”。这说明孔厥这个为人民所唾弃的“作家”，他的人身对社会的危险程度是严重的，从刑法观点上来看是应加重处刑的。
    仅从以上两点分析，孔厥的犯罪行为，确实危害了我国社会主义过渡时期的社会关系和社会秩序，触犯了人民的法律。应当受人民法律的严正裁判。
