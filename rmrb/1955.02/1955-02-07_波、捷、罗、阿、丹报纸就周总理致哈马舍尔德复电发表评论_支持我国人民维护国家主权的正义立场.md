Xinhua News Agency, February 6th dispatch: According to a Warsaw dispatch from the Polish Press Agency on the 5th, "Warsaw Life Daily" published an article on the 5th, supporting the reply telegram from Zhou Enlai, Premier and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld. The newspaper said that in the United Nations and in the Security Council meetings, only one voice can represent China, and that is the voice of the legitimate government of the People's Republic of China.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 6th dispatch: The Czechoslovakian newspaper "Red Right Daily" commented on the 5th on the reply telegram from Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, saying that the telegram "once again pointed out the real reasons for the tense situation in the Far East." The newspaper also pointed out that New Zealand's proposal is "thoroughly serving American aggression purposes." The Chinese people liberating the entire motherland is entirely China's internal affair and also the sovereignty of the Chinese people. To obtain genuine peace and security in the Far East, the Security Council must find ways to immediately end the United States' aggressive actions and immediately rescind all of the United States' large-scale war preparations on China's seas.

Xinhua News Agency, February 6th dispatch: According to a Bucharest dispatch from the Romanian News Agency on the 5th, the Romanian newspaper "Spark" published a commentary on the 5th on the reply telegram from Zhou Enlai, Premier and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, to the United Nations Secretary-General.

"Spark" wrote that this reply is a reasonable and powerful expression of the People's Republic of China. At the same time, it also effectively exposed and smashed the recent conspiracies of the United States and other aggressive blocs against the Chinese people, infringing upon their sovereignty, and undermining peace in Asia. "Spark" pointed out that the United States' aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China have aroused the indignation of world public opinion. The Romanian people, together with peace-loving people all over the world, fully support the just and firm stance of the Chinese people and their struggle to defend national sovereignty and peace in the Far East.

Xinhua News Agency, February 6th dispatch: According to a Tirana dispatch from the Albanian News Agency on the 5th, Albanian newspapers widely commented on the 5th on the reply telegram from Zhou Enlai, Premier and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, to United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjöld.

"People's Voice" newspaper's editorial was entitled "The Just Reply of the Chinese People." The editorial wrote: The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is not fighting against any country, but is only exercising their legitimate right and sovereignty to liberate Taiwan, Chinese territory, from the hands of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. This is fundamentally an internal affair, and no one has the right to interfere.

The editorial pointed out: World public opinion and the peace forces fighting to ease international tensions support the Chinese government's decision as expressed in Premier Zhou Enlai's reply telegram. The Security Council must, as required in the Soviet proposal, condemn the United States' aggressive acts against the People's Republic of China, take measures to withdraw American troops from Taiwan and other islands of China, and stop the United States from interfering in China's internal affairs.

Xinhua News Agency, February 6th dispatch: Copenhagen news: Danish newspapers published the news of the telegram from Zhou Enlai, Premier and Foreign Minister of the People's Republic of China, in response to UN Secretary General Hammarskjöld, on the 4th.

The Danish "Homeland and People's Daily" published an editorial on the 5th entitled "Insult to the United Nations," supporting Premier Zhou Enlai's refusal to participate in the United Nations Security Council's discussion of the New Zealand proposal. The editorial said: "American officials call this an insult to the United Nations, but in fact, the United States continues to obstruct China from joining the United Nations, allowing Chiang Kai-shek's representatives to sit in the United Nations, which is precisely an insult to the United Nations." The editorial also pointed out that Eden's argument that "Taiwan should be neutralized" and his recognition of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique representing China in the United Nations is utterly absurd. The editorial pointed out that Denmark should fully support the People's Republic of China's entry into the United Nations.

On the 4th, the Danish "News Daily" published an editorial entitled "The Future of Taiwan," saying: It seems unreasonable that the Western powers have chosen the Security Council as a venue for consultation on the Taiwan issue, because submitting this issue to an organization that still recognizes Chiang Kai-shek as the representative of China is a direct challenge to Beijing.

专栏：

    波、捷、罗、阿、丹报纸就周总理致哈马舍尔德复电发表评论
    支持我国人民维护国家主权的正义立场
    【新华社六日讯】　据波兰通讯社华沙五日消息，“华沙生活报”五日发表文章，支持中华人民共和国国务院总理兼外交部长周恩来给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的复电。这家报纸说，在联合国里和安全理事会的会议上，只能够有一个声音代表中国，这就是中华人民共和国的合法政府的声音。
    【新华社布拉格六日电】　捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”五日评周恩来总理兼外交部长给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的复电说，这个复电“再度指明了远东紧张局势的真正原因”。这家报纸并且指出，新西兰的建议是“彻头彻尾地为美国侵略目的服务的”。中国人民解放整个的祖国完全是中国内政，也是中国人民的主权。要得到远东地区的真正和平和安全，就要使安全理事会设法立即结束美国的侵略行动，立即使美国撤消它在中国海上的一切大规模的战争准备。
    据新华社六日讯：据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特五日消息，罗马尼亚“火花报”五日就中华人民共和国国务院总理兼外交部长周恩来给联合国秘书长的复电发表评论。
    “火花报”写道，这个答复是中华人民共和国有理和有力的表现，同时，也很好地揭穿和粉碎了最近美国和其他国家的侵略集团反对中国人民、侵犯他们的主权和破坏亚洲和平的阴谋。“火花报”指出，美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行动激起了世界舆论的愤慨。罗马尼亚人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，充分支持中国人民的正义和坚定的立场以及他们保卫国家主权、保卫远东和平的斗争。
    【新华社六日讯】　据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社地拉那五日消息，阿尔巴尼亚的报纸五日广泛评论中华人民共和国国务院总理兼外交部长周恩来给联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的复电。
    “人民之声报”的社论题目是“中国人民的正义答复”。社论写道：中国人民解放台湾的斗争不是对任何国家作战，而只是执行他们从蒋介石卖国集团手中解放中国领土台湾的合法权利和主权。这根本是一个内政问题，任何人都无权干涉。
    社论指出：世界舆论和为缓和国际紧张局势而斗争的和平力量支持周恩来复电中所表明的中国政府的决定。安全理事会必须像苏联提案中所要求的，谴责美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为，采取措施使美国从中国的台湾和其他岛屿撤退军队，制止美国对中国内政的干涉。
    【新华社六日讯】　哥本哈根消息：丹麦各报四日发表了中华人民共和国国务院总理兼外交部长周恩来答复联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德的电报的消息。
    丹麦“国土与人民报”五日以“对联合国的侮辱”为题发表社论，支持周恩来总理拒绝参加联合国安全理事会讨论新西兰建议。社论说：“美国官方把这个说成是对联合国的侮辱，而实际上美国继续阻挠中国加入联合国，让蒋介石的代表坐在联合国才正是对联合国的侮辱。”社论并指出，艾登所说“台湾要中立化”的论点和他承认蒋介石卖国集团在联合国中代表中国是荒谬透顶的。社论指出丹麦应完全支持中华人民共和国加入联合国。
    四日，丹麦“消息报”以“台湾的前途”为题发表社论说：西方大国挑选了以安全理事会作为协商台湾问题的场所看来是不合理的。因为把这个问题提交给一个仍然公认蒋介石为中国代表的组织来讨论，是对北京的直接挑战。
