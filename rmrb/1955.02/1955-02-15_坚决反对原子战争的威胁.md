Resolutely Oppose the Threat of Atomic War
Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace

The American aggressors are threatening to use force to prevent us from liberating Taiwan, openly engaging in war provocations against China. The aggressive bloc headed by the United States has also signed the Paris Agreement, accelerating the revival of West German militarism, and expanding the European war crisis. At the same time, they are frantically clamoring for and openly preparing for atomic war. At this time, the World Peace Council held an expanded meeting of its Standing Committee in Vienna from January 18 to 19, 1955, and issued three important documents, pointing out the current tasks of the peace movement. To express the protest of the people of the world against the preparation of atomic war, it was decided to launch a large-scale signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons worldwide. The Chinese people express warm and full support for these resolutions.

The Chinese people, like peace-loving people all over the world, have consistently and resolutely demanded the prohibition of atomic weapons. In 1950, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress launched the Stockholm Appeal signature campaign to ban atomic weapons, which garnered the support of more than 500 million people around the world, including more than 220 million Chinese people who signed in support of this movement. Now, the Chinese people are once again launching a signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons on a larger scale across the country to express our determination and will, to respond to and support the call of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, and to cooperate with the great struggle of the people of all countries against atomic war. Facts have proved that it is precisely the great influence and role produced by the powerful movement that fully demonstrates the will, conscience, and aspirations of the people of all countries that has stopped the outrageous conspiracy of the American warmongers who initially attempted to use atomic bombs in the Korean War and later wanted to use them in Indochina. This shows that the great power generated by the movement of the people of all countries against atomic weapons and atomic war is effective, and is something that no force can hinder or resist.

The American aggressive bloc, which has long lost its monopoly on atomic energy, is increasingly intensifying its efforts to advocate and prepare for atomic war, regardless of the peace aspirations and strong opposition of the people of all countries. This shows that they are more and more obviously choosing the evil path of expanding atomic weapons and the arms race, and want to use weapons of mass destruction to continue to threaten, intimidate, and blackmail the people of all countries. Therefore, as the declaration of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council pointed out: "The world peace movement calls on the people of all countries to recognize the enormous extent of the new danger and to do everything in their power to prevent this danger."

Today, the struggle to demand the prohibition of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs and to oppose atomic war has become an important part of the world peace movement. The American aggressive bloc's frantic clamoring and provocative actions of atomic war have aroused increasingly fierce anger and more resolute opposition from the people of Asia and the world. In the past six months, the Japanese people, who have suffered three atomic bombings, have enthusiastically launched a powerful movement involving more than 20 million signatures from all sectors of the country to oppose the recurrence of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki incidents and to demand the prohibition of atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. Not long ago, the prime ministers of the five South Asian countries also repeatedly reiterated their serious concern about the destructive potential of atomic weapon explosions. The signature campaign against atomic war, which is rapidly unfolding in Asia and around the world, is developing like a raging fire and will converge into an incomparably powerful torrent. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council emphasized in its declaration: "The joint action of the people of all countries can stop group politics. It can enable governments to negotiate on the issue of disarmament and the complete use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes." There is no doubt that the powerful force of the large-scale signature campaign of the people of all countries against the use of atomic weapons will prevent the realization of the conspiracy of those warmongers who attempt to launch an atomic war.

In the movement of the people of all countries against atomic weapons and atomic war plans, the brilliant achievements of the Soviet Union in atomic energy and its powerful struggle to adhere to the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons have great significance. Recently, the Soviet Union has further strived to carry out international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy; it has decided to help China and other people's democratic countries develop scientific research on atomic energy, and is considering expanding the scope of this assistance. The Soviet Union's brilliant performance in using atomic energy for peace to promote human civilization on the basis of international cooperation is another clear example of the peace policy of countries with incomparably superior socialist systems. The efforts made by the Soviet Union in this regard have opened up avenues for international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy, and have been warmly welcomed by the Chinese people and the people of all countries in the world. The Chinese people express their heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet Union for its selfless assistance.

The mutual assistance, friendship, solidarity, and cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet people are important factors in opposing atomic war and safeguarding world peace. With the help and cooperation of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people will further strengthen the friendship and solidarity between the Chinese and Soviet people, and together with the people of the people's democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union, as well as the peace-loving people of all countries in the world, resolutely oppose atomic war, oppose the use of atomic weapons, and promote the peaceful use of atomic energy to benefit mankind. The American aggressive bloc's attempt to use the threat of atomic weapons to occupy Chinese territory and prepare for a new war of destruction cannot scare the Chinese people. The Chinese people love peace, but they will never sacrifice their territorial sovereignty to beg for peace. Taiwan is an inseparable part of China, and the liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair, which brooks no interference from anyone. The Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan is unshakable. The American aggressive armed forces must withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait, and any attempt to split China is also resolutely opposed by the Chinese people. This just position of the Chinese people has been widely supported by the people of Asia and the world.

Our 600 million Chinese people warmly support the resolutions of the expanded meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council and promote their full realization with positive and concrete actions. We are determined to join the people of Europe and the world in opposing the remilitarization of West Germany and opposing the threat of atomic war. As the Chinese proverb says, "He who plays with fire will be burned." We believe that the warmongers who attempt to use atomic energy to destroy mankind will only bring about their own destruction, and the concerted action of the people of all countries who insist on the peaceful use of atomic energy will eventually completely thwart the conspiracy of atomic war and ensure peace.

    坚决反对原子战争的威胁
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会副主席　陈叔通
    美国侵略者威胁要用武力阻止我们解放台湾，公开对中国进行战争挑衅。以美国为首的侵略集团又签订了巴黎协定，加紧复活西德军国主义，扩大欧洲的战争危机，同时，它们还疯狂叫嚣与公然准备原子战争。正在这个时候，世界和平理事会于一九五五年一月十八日至十九日在维也纳举行常务委员会扩大会议，发表了三个重要的文件，指出了保卫和平运动当前的任务。为表达全世界人民对准备原子战争的抗议，并决定在全世界范围内发动一个大规模的反对使用原子武器的签名运动。中国人民对这些决议表示热烈的全面的拥护和支持。
    中国人民和世界爱好和平的人民一样，一贯坚决要求禁止使用原子武器。一九五○年世界拥护和平大会常设委员会发动禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言签名运动，获得了全世界各国五亿以上人民的签名拥护，其中中国人民签名支持这个运动的就有二亿二千多万人。现在中国人民又再一次在全国范围以更大的规模轰轰烈烈地展开反对使用原子武器的签名运动来表达我们的决心和意志，来响应和支持世界和平理事会常务委员会的号召，来配合世界各国人民反对原子战争的伟大斗争。事实证明：正是由于充分表现出各国人民意志、良心与愿望的强大的运动所产生的巨大影响和作用，才制止住美国好战分子最先企图在朝鲜战争中、后来又想在印度支那使用原子弹的狂妄阴谋。这说明了世界各国人民反对原子武器和原子战争的运动所产生的巨大威力是有效的，是任何力量所不能阻挠和不可抗拒的。
    早已失去原子能垄断地位的美国侵略集团，不顾世界各国人民的和平愿望和强烈的反对，日益变本加厉地竭力鼓吹和准备原子战争。这就说明它们正愈来愈明显地选择了扩张原子武器和军备竞赛的罪恶道路，并想用大规模毁灭性武器来继续威胁、恫吓并讹诈各国人民。因此，正如世界和平理事会常务委员会宣言指出的：“世界和平运动号召各国人民认识新的危险的巨大程度，并且尽他们力所能及的一切办法来防止这种危险。”
    今天，要求禁止原子弹、氢弹、反对原子战争的斗争，已经成为世界和平运动的重要一环。美国侵略集团的原子战争的疯狂叫嚣和挑衅行动，引起了亚洲及世界各国人民日益激昂的愤怒和更加坚决的反对。最近半年以来，曾经遭受到三次原子爆炸祸害的日本人民，热烈展开了普及全国各阶层的有两千多万人签名的强大运动，来反对广岛和长崎事件的重演、要求禁止原子弹和氢弹。不久前，南亚五国总理会议也曾一再重申他们对原子武器爆炸的毁灭性潜力的严重关切。目前在亚洲和全世界迅速展开的反对原子战争的签名运动，正如火如荼的发展着，并将汇成无比强大的巨流。世界和平理事会常务委员会在它的宣言中强调指出：“各国人民的联合行动能够制止集团政策。它能够使得各国政府就裁减军备问题和把核子能完全用于和平目的问题进行谈判。”毫无疑义，世界各国人民反对使用原子武器的大规模签名运动的强大力量，将阻止那些妄图发动原子战争的好战者阴谋的实现。
    在世界各国人民反对原子武器和原子战争计划运动中，苏联在原子能方面获得的辉煌成就及其坚持禁止使用原子武器和氢武器的有力斗争，有着巨大的意义。最近苏联更进一步努力来开展和平利用原子能的国际合作；决定帮助中国及各人民民主国家发展原子能的科学研究，并且考虑扩大这种援助的范围。苏联这种在国际合作基础上，把原子能用于和平以促进人类文明发展的光辉表现，是具有无比优越性的社会主义制度国家的和平政策的又一鲜明例证。苏联在这方面所作的努力，为和平利用原子能的国际合作打开途径，受到中国人民和世界各国人民的热烈欢迎。中国人民对于苏联的无私的援助表示衷心感谢。
    中苏两国人民的互助友谊和团结合作是反对原子战争、保卫世界和平的重要因素。在苏联的帮助和合作下，中国人民将进一步加强中苏两国人民的友谊和团结，并与以苏联为首的各人民民主国家以及世界爱好和平的各国人民一道，坚决反对原子战争、反对使用原子武器并促进和平利用原子能以造福人类。美国侵略集团企图用原子武器的威胁来霸占中国领土、准备新的毁灭战争，这是吓不倒中国人民的。中国人民热爱和平，但决不会牺牲自己领土主权来乞求和平。台湾是中国不可分割的一部分，解放台湾是中国的内政，不容任何人干涉。中国人民一定要解放台湾的决心是不可动摇的。美国的侵略武装必须从台湾及台湾海峡撤走，任何企图分裂中国的阴谋，也同样为中国人民所坚决反对。中国人民这一正义的立场，得到了亚洲及全世界各国人民的广泛支持。
    我们六亿中国人民热烈地支持世界和平理事会常务委员会扩大会议的各项决议，并以积极的、具体的行动来促使其完全实现。我们坚决与欧洲和全世界人民一起，反对西德重新军国主义化、反对原子战争的威胁。中国谚语说得好：“玩火者必自焚”。我们相信，企图利用原子能来毁灭人类的好战分子将只能招致自己的毁灭，而坚持和平利用原子能的各国人民的一致行动，终将彻底挫败原子战争的阴谋计划，使和平得到保障。
