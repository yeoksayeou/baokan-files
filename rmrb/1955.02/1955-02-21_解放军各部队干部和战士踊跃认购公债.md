    People's Liberation Army Units' Cadres and Soldiers Enthusiastically Subscribe to Public Bonds

    The cadres and soldiers of various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army enthusiastically subscribed to the 1955 National Economic Construction Bonds, and many units subscribed to amounts exceeding the planned quota.

    When the subscription of public bonds began in various units, widespread propaganda on the country's socialist construction was carried out. The leaders and reporters of many units made reports to the troops. Some units also published special issues on blackboard newspapers and wall newspapers on subscribing to public bonds. The wired broadcasting stations of the troops also continuously reported to cadres and soldiers on the enthusiastic subscriptions of public bonds by people all over the country. Many troops completed or exceeded the planned subscription quota within a few hours or a day after the subscription began. For example, students and cadres of a military school in the Northeast Military Region subscribed to 346 million yuan, exceeding the estimated subscription number by more than two times. The amount subscribed by the directly subordinate organs of the Songhu Garrison of the East China Military Region reached more than 280 percent of the planned amount. The subscription amounts of artillery, air force, and public security units in the Southwest Military Region exceeded the planned amount by one to three times.

    The cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army showed their love for the motherland in their subscriptions. Zeng Zemin, a cultural instructor of a certain unit of the Air Force of the Southwest Military Region, usually lives a simple and frugal life. This time, he used his savings of 1.5 million yuan to buy public bonds. Zhang Guang'en, political instructor of the Third Battalion of a certain unit of the Northeast Military Region, used all his savings from three and a half months of allowances to buy public bonds last year. This time, he subscribed to another 1 million yuan. He said: "I bought public bonds with my surplus money, on the one hand, to support national economic construction, and on the other hand, to cultivate my habit of saving." Sun Riyin, a military instructor of a certain artillery unit, bought 650,000 yuan of public bonds with his savings last year, and now he has subscribed to more than 1.5 million yuan of public bonds. Sheng Shuican, a soldier of a certain anti-aircraft artillery company of the East China Air Defense Force, bought all 450,000 yuan of his savings from last year. Cui Bawa, a soldier student of a certain accelerated middle school in the Northwest Military Region, also bought 100,000 yuan of public bonds. Gao Yingzhou, the squad leader of a certain company of the Inner Mongolia Military Region, bought public bonds with the money he saved. He said: "Even if the money I bought for public bonds can only buy a brick, it is a brick for the construction of socialism in the motherland!"

    解放军各部队干部和战士踊跃认购公债
    【新华社二十日讯】中国人民解放军各部队干部、战士踊跃认购一九五五年国家经济建设公债，许多单位认购的数额都超过了预定计划。
    各部队在开始认购公债时，普遍展开了关于国家社会主义建设的宣传，许多单位的首长和报告员向部队作了报告。有的部队还在黑板报和墙报上出了认购公债的专刊。部队的有线广播站也连续向干部和战士报告了全国各地人民踊跃认购公债的情况。许多部队开始认购后，在数小时或一天内就完成或超过了预定的认购计划。如东北军区某军事学校的学员和干部认购了三亿四千六百多万元，超过预计认购数的两倍多。华东军区淞沪警备部队直属机关认购的数额达到了预定数额的百分之二百八十以上。西南军区炮兵、空军和公安部队等单位的认购数额超过预定数的一倍到三倍。
    人民解放军各部队的干部和战士在认购中都表现了热爱祖国的精神。西南军区空军部队某部文化教员曾则鸣，平时生活朴素节俭，这次他把自己储蓄的一百五十万元用来购买公债。东北军区某部三营政治指导员张广恩去年认购公债时曾经用节约下来的三个半月的津贴费全部买了公债，这次他又认购了一百万元，他说：“我把余钱买了公债，一方面支援了国家经济建设，一方面也可养成自己节约储蓄的习惯。”炮兵某部军事教员孙日银，去年曾经把积蓄下来的六十五万元买了公债，现在他又认购了一百五十多万元公债。华东防空部队某高射炮连战士生水灿把去年一年中积蓄的四十五万元全部买了公债。西北军区某速成中学战士学员崔八娃也购买了十万元公债。内蒙古军区某连班长高赢洲，把节约下来的钱购买了公债，他说：“那怕我购买公债的钱只能买一块砖，但这是为祖国建设社会主义的一块砖呀！”
