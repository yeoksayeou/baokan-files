    Jixi Coal Mine has begun to change its unreasonable mining procedures. In the past, due to a lack of understanding of the coal seam's geological conditions, and a lack of awareness of the need to protect national underground resources, most of the mine's pits had not followed reasonable mining procedures for a long time, such as mining the upper coal seam before the lower coal seam. Instead, the easily mined lower coal seams were mined first, resulting in varying degrees of damage to the upper coal seams. Since August of last year, the mine has changed the mining procedures in seven mines where the upper coal seams were severely damaged. Currently, Hengshan No. 10 Mine is actively driving stone gates (tunnels through rock strata) and excavating roadways to open up new working faces on the new coal seams above. Hengshan No. 6 Mine is excavating transport roadways. Mashan No. 5 Mine has also begun opening working faces and will soon be able to mine new coal seams. In the first quarter of 1955, three mines will be able to carry out upper coal seam mining. In order to completely change the mine's situation of blind mining, the mine has also taken specific measures to strengthen geological production work, requiring that the geological conditions of the existing mine field range and coal seam structure be basically clarified in 1955.

    鸡西改变不合理的采煤程序
    鸡西煤矿已在着手改变不合理的开采程序。该矿过去因对煤层地质情况不清楚，同时缺乏爱护国家地下资源的观念，大部矿井长时期来都没有依据合理的开采程序，先采上层煤再采下层煤，而是先采好采的下层煤，因此使上层煤遭到了不同程度的破坏。去年八月起，该矿将七个上层煤层受到破坏比较严重的矿井的采煤程序改变过来。目前，恒山十坑正在积极打石门（穿过岩层）掘巷道，以便在上边的新煤层上开出新的掌子面来。恒山六坑正在掘进运输巷道。麻山五坑也已在开掌子面，不久即可到新的煤层上去开采了。一九五五年的第一季度，将有三个矿井可以进行上层煤的开采工作。为了彻底改变该矿盲目开采的情况，该矿同时采取了加强生产地质工作的具体措施，要求在一九五五年内基本弄清现有矿井井田范围和煤层层次构造的地质情况。　（本报黑龙江记者站）
