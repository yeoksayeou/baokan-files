Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: In the past year, people from various places have written to national leading organs and the People's Bank of China, expressing their fervent desire for the issuance of a new currency to replace the current Renminbi. Shao Baichuan of Yangzhou said in his letter that China's financial situation has fundamentally improved, prices have stabilized to an unprecedented degree in many years, and its international status has been raised to an unprecedented level, but the face value of the current currency is very high and differs greatly from the face value of other countries' currencies. Ban Zhihai, a state organ worker, wrote to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, saying: Over the past few years, prices have stabilized and the currency system has been consolidated, but because the face value of the current Renminbi is large, the numbers in the national budget and final accounts have too many digits, and people's daily expenses are calculated in tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of yuan, which increases many difficulties in calculation and use. He suggested issuing a new currency. Many staff members of economic departments pointed out in their letters that the face value of the old Renminbi is large, making calculation and use inconvenient. Shang Zhikun of the Tianjin Factory Repair Team said in his letter: "From my work, I feel that every day I record, calculate, and copy numbers, what could be written and calculated at once now requires several times the effort. Each number has to be written with several more digits. If we calculate the number of economic workers in the country, how much manpower is wasted!" He said, "I earnestly hope that the government can issue new currency as soon as possible." Zeng Tiande, a technician from the Southwest Second Construction Engineering Company, said in his letter: "The current Renminbi originally uses 'yuan' as the unit of calculation, but because the face value is large, many institutions use 'thousand yuan', 'ten thousand yuan' or even 'hundred million yuan' as the unit of calculation, which is inconsistent and prone to errors." Yang Longbiao of the Yuxian County Department Store in Henan wrote in his letter: "Because there is no certain difference in the size of the Renminbi, it is difficult to sort the banknotes. I often sort the banknotes after get off work every day, and I don't have time to participate in recreational activities, which affects my health." Liu Zhanxing wrote in a letter: The current Renminbi has many types, and there are no certain regulations on the color and design of the banknotes, which are difficult to identify and use. Many people also put forward specific opinions on the face value, size, and pattern design of the new currency in their letters. Shang Zhikun of the Tianjin Factory Repair Team said in his letter: "The face value of the new currency should be reduced to one ten-thousandth, that is, one yuan of the new currency is equal to ten thousand yuan of the current Renminbi, and the calculation units of auxiliary currencies 'jiao' and 'fen' should be restored."

    各地人民热烈要求发行新货币
    【新华社二十日讯】最近一年来，各地人民写信给国家领导机关和中国人民银行，表示他们对发行一种新货币来代替现行人民币的热烈愿望。扬州邵百川的信中说，我国财经状况已根本好转，物价出现多少年来从未有过的稳定，国际地位空前提高，但是现行货币票面额很高，和其他国家货币的票面额相差很大。国家机关工作人员班志海在写给全国人民代表大会常务委员会的信中说：几年来，物价已趋稳定，币制已经稳固，但由于现行人民币票面额大，国家预算决算的数字位数太多，人民日常生活开支以数万元、数十万元计，计算和使用上都增加不少困难。他建议发行一种新的货币。许多经济部门的工作人员的信中都指出旧人民币票面额大，计算和使用都不方便。天津工厂大修队尚志堃在信中说：“我从工作里感到，每天记录、计算、抄写数目字，本来一下可以写出算出的，而现在必须增加几倍的力量，每一笔数要多写几位数，以全国经济工作人员的人数来计算，该浪费多少人力。”他说：“我热烈希望政府能早一天发行新的货币。”西南第二建筑工程公司技术员曾天德在信中说：“现行人民币本来是以‘元’为计算单位，因为票面额大，许多机关就以‘千元’、‘万元’甚至‘亿元’为计算单位，各不统一，又容易出错。”河南禹县百货商店杨龙彪在信中写道：“因为人民币的大小没有一定的差别，整理钞票很困难，我经常在每天下班后整理钞票，没有时间参加文娱活动，影响身体健康。”刘占兴来信说：现行人民币种类很多，票面颜色、图案没有一定的规定，难于辨认，使用困难。许多群众在来信中还提出了对新币票面额、票样大小以及图案设计的具体意见。天津工厂大修队尚志堃在信中说：“新币票面数字应缩小为万分之一，即新币一元等于现行人民币一万元，并恢复辅币‘角’和‘分’的计算单位。”
