    In the Forest Area of Heilongjiang
    He Zhongyun
    The forest areas of the Greater and Lesser Khingan Mountains, Changbai Mountains, and Wanda Mountains in Heilongjiang Province are famous timber-producing areas in our country, rich in Korean pine, Sakhalin fir, Dahurian larch, Siberian red pine, Scotch pine, Larch, Amur cork tree, Manchurian ash, and birch, supplying a large amount of timber for the needs of industrial and national defense construction. The timber needed for the construction of projects such as the Dongshan Shaft of the Hegang Coal Mine, the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the Huai River harnessing project, and many new railway lines are all supplied by the forest area of Heilongjiang.

    In recent years, the development of the forest industry in Heilongjiang Province has been astonishing. In 1953, the output of the Yichun forest area increased by 632 percent compared with 1949, and in 1954 it increased even more to 1209 percent. Many new forest areas have also been opened up. The Shangganling forest area on the Tangming River in the Lesser Khingan Mountains was newly developed in 1953. In 1949, there were only thirteen forestry bureaus and dozens of logging yards in the entire Heilongjiang Province, but now it has developed into twenty-four forest industry administrations and more than five hundred logging yards. The number of forest railways has also increased from nine to eighteen. The number of forestry workers has increased from tens of thousands to 180,000.

    In the past, almost all forestry production in Heilongjiang Province was manual felling, relying on manpower, animal power, and water power to collect and transport timber. Due to seasonal restrictions, production often had great impulsiveness, with spring and winter being busy and summer and autumn being idle throughout the year. Now the face of the forest industry has gradually changed, and mechanized production accounts for more than half. Five forest industry administrations, including Wudaoku, Muling, and Shihuanzhen, have used trucks to transport timber; ten forest industry administrations, including Yichun, Shangganling, Shuangzihe, Youhao, and Cuiluan, have used tractors to transport timber. Five fully mechanized forest industry administrations and a fully electrified logging yard have appeared in the Lesser Khingan Mountains. In Liangshuigou in the Dailing forest area, electric saws and winches were used for felling, processing, and collecting timber starting in September 1953, and the efficiency of felling was more than nine times higher than that of manual felling. When shipping timber, gantry-style loading machines manufactured by the Harbin Rolling Stock Plant were also used. In the past, human power was used to raft timber on the Songhua River, which was not only inefficient but also often caused accidents. Now steamships are used to tow timber rafts. Under the guidance of Soviet experts, the methods of felling have also been greatly improved. In the past, the remaining tree trunks after felling were more than one meter high, but now they have been reduced to less than twenty centimeters. The material yield rate has also increased from 50 percent to 75 percent.

    With the development of forestry production, the appearance of the forest area is also constantly changing. Yichun City, which was newly built after liberation, has now become the largest city in the forests of the motherland. The once remote forest areas of Langxiang, Tonghe, and Dahailin have all become bustling mountain towns. In these new towns, department stores, grain companies, native product companies, pharmaceutical companies, people's banks, Xinhua bookstores, and post and telecommunications bureaus have been established. Cinemas, theaters, libraries, clubs, bathhouses, and canteens have appeared in the forest area; worker cadre schools, worker children's schools, and four or five middle schools have been established. The Dailing Forest Industry School, a school for training forestry technical personnel, has recently been built in a beautiful basin in the middle of the Suijia Railway Line. There are now more than twenty hospitals in the forest area. There are about five hundred clinic stations in the workshops. Some forest areas have established nurseries. A nursing home has also been established on the banks of the Yongcui River in Dailing, surrounded by mountains. In the past, it was relatively difficult to eat refined grains and vegetables in the forest area. Since the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain, it has been possible to eat enough refined grains in the forest area. At the same time, due to the state's planned supply of materials needed by the forest area, most of the workers in the forest area can eat fish, meat, and enough vegetables.

    在黑龙江林区
    赫重运
    黑龙江省的大、小兴安岭、长白山和完达山等林区，是我国著名的木材产区，盛产红松、鱼鳞松、黄花松、西伯利亚赤松、樟子松、落叶松、黄波罗、水曲柳和桦木，大量供应着工业建设和国防建设的需要。像鹤岗煤矿的东山竖井、武汉长江大桥、鞍山钢铁公司、第一汽车制造厂、治淮工程和许多新铁路线等建设所需要的木材，都是黑龙江林区供应的。
    这几年来，黑龙江省森林工业的发展是惊人的。伊春林区一九五三年的产量比一九四九年增加了百分之六百三十二，一九五四年更增加到百分之一千二百零九。新的林区也开辟了很多。像小兴安岭汤明河上的上甘岭林区就是一九五三年新开发的。一九四九年时，全黑龙江省只有十三个林务分局和几十个伐木场，现在已经发展到二十四个森林工业管理局和五百多处伐木场。森林铁路也由九条增加到十八条。林业职工由几万名增加到了十八万名。
    过去黑龙江省的林业生产差不多全部是手工采伐，依靠人力、畜力和水力来集运木材。由于受季节的限制，生产常有很大的突击性，一年四季，春、冬忙，夏、秋闲。现在森林工业的面貌已经逐步改变了，机械化生产的比重已经占一半以上。五道库、穆棱、世环镇等五个森林工业管理局已经用汽车运木材；伊春、上甘岭、双子河、友好、翠峦等十个森林工业管理局已经用拖拉机运木材。在小兴安岭上出现了五个全部机械化的森林工业管理局和一个完全电气化的伐木场。带岭林区的凉水沟，一九五三年九月已开始使用电锯，绞盘机等伐木、造材、集材，伐木效率比手工采伐提高九倍多。在发运木材时，还用了哈尔滨机车车辆制造厂制造的架杆式装车机。在松花江上，过去都用人力放排，不但效率不高，而且经常发生事故，现在已经用汽船拖运木排了。在苏联专家的指导下，采伐的方法也有了很大改进。过去采伐以后剩下的树干有一公尺多高，现在已降低到二十公分以下。造材率也由百分之五十提高到百分之七十五。
    随着林业生产的发展，林区的面貌也在不断地变化着。解放后新建设起来的伊春城，现在已成为祖国森林中最大的城市。过去很偏僻的郎乡、通河、大海林等林区都变成了繁华的山城。在这些新城镇中，设立了百货公司、粮食公司、土产公司、医药公司、人民银行、新华书店、邮电局。林区里出现了电影院、剧院、图书馆、俱乐部、浴池和食堂；开办了工人干部学校、工人子弟学校和四、五所中学。在绥佳线中间一块风景幽美的盆地上，最近又新建筑起一座培养林业技术人材的带岭森林工业学校。林区医院现在已有二十几所。车间医务所有五百个左右。有的林区设立了托儿站。在群山环抱的带岭永翠河畔还设立了养老院。过去林区里吃细粮和蔬菜比较困难，自从实行粮食统购统销以后，林区里可以吃到足够的细粮了。同时由于国家有计划地供应林区的物资需要，林区的工人大部都可以吃到鱼、肉和足够的蔬菜。
