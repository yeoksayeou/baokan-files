    Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd: The meeting of the Manila Treaty countries convened by the United States is scheduled to be held in Bangkok, Thailand, on February 23rd. Participants in the meeting include US Secretary of State Dulles, British Foreign Secretary Eden, former French Ambassador to the United States Bonnet, and the foreign ministers of Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Thailand.
    Four days before the meeting, Philippine Foreign Minister Garcia announced in Manila on the 19th that the countries participating in the Manila Treaty had ratified the treaty, and the treaty would come into effect from that day. As early as January 3rd, the US State Department officially announced that a meeting of Manila Treaty countries would be held in Bangkok to discuss specific ways to implement the treaty. The United States, without even waiting for all the countries participating in the Manila Treaty to ratify it, hurriedly announced the convening of the Bangkok meeting to discuss specific ways to implement the Manila Treaty. This fully demonstrates how impatiently the United States is attempting to strengthen its aggressive military power in Asia through this meeting, and to deepen the tension and division in Asia in preparation for new military adventures. At the same time, it is no accident that the United States chose to convene the Bangkok meeting before the Asian-African Conference. Because the prospect of peaceful cooperation among Asian and African countries offered by the Asian-African Conference is an unfavorable prospect for the US war forces.
    As can be seen from the news released by Western news agencies, military issues occupy a priority position on the agenda of the Bangkok meeting. These news agencies do not conceal that the important task of the Bangkok meeting is to equip the Manila Treaty Group with "teeth" and make it a tool for the United States to carry out aggression in Asia. Dulles announced as early as the end of last December that the United States would propose at the Bangkok meeting the establishment of a "permanent command" and a "mobile force" for the Manila Group. An Associated Press reporter pointed out in a report on Dulles' departure to Bangkok that Dulles was taking a plan to Bangkok to establish such a military organization.
    News revealed that when planning military activities, the Bangkok meeting will focus on studying specific ways to oppose so-called "subversive activities." According to a Reuters report, people in Washington revealed that the meeting will specifically establish a "political intelligence agency" called the "Anti-Subversion Committee," attempting to use this to strengthen espionage activities, suppress the struggle of Asian people for independence, freedom, and democracy, and at the same time intensify subversive activities within Asian countries that refuse to participate in the Manila Treaty, attempting to drag these countries into the Manila Group.
    On the eve of Dulles' departure for Bangkok, a piece of news published in the "New York Post" revealed that the United States intends to propose a meeting of military representatives from Manila Treaty countries to specifically discuss the Indochina issue. Prior to this, there had been many reports that one of the main purposes of the Bangkok meeting was to discuss how to interfere in Indochina. As the date for the nationwide general election in Vietnam stipulated in the Geneva Accords approaches, how to obstruct this election from becoming a truly democratic and free election and turn South Vietnam into a base for the United States to launch aggressive adventures has become one of the important conspiracies of the United States in Southeast Asia. In order to specifically deploy this conspiracy to undermine the Geneva Accords, Dulles has announced that he will conduct activities in South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia after the Bangkok meeting.
    At the same time, more and more news reveals that Dulles also intends to discuss the situation in the Taiwan area with Eden and representatives of other countries in Bangkok. Agence France-Presse reported that "Dulles will try to persuade other members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to link the security of Southeast Asia with the US strategy in the Taiwan Strait." This shows that the United States is also attempting to use this meeting to tie its "allies" more tightly to the US war chariot for aggression against China, forcing them to serve the US policy of occupying Taiwan more directly.
    In order to cover up the obvious military nature of the Bangkok meeting, the US propaganda machine has recently been trying its best to spread the argument that the meeting will also discuss the issue of "economic aid" to Asian countries. The United States and Britain are attempting to use "economic aid" as bait to lure more Southeast Asian countries to participate in the Manila Treaty Organization and use this "aid" to economically control Asian countries. But their approach has not aroused a favorable response in Asian countries. Public opinion in many Asian countries such as India and Ceylon demands vigilance against this conspiracy of the United States and Britain. The "Ceylon Times" pointed out that "at present, nothing would exacerbate tensions more than making concessions to the demands of the United States and Britain in this regard."
    On the eve of the Bangkok meeting, Western news agencies and newspapers are showing increasing anxiety about the divisions that will appear at the meeting. They pointed out that Britain and the United States harbor their own different plans in establishing the military power of the Manila Group. United Press International reported that what Britain needs is "to establish a military organization of the Manila Group that it can control." There are also differences between other participating countries and the United States, as well as among themselves. Agence France-Presse pointed out in a news report, "The eight member countries of the Manila Treaty have differences in their views on the objectives of the treaty organization, and they are hesitant in the methods to achieve these objectives." The news revealed that putting pressure on these half-hearted allies of the United States to make them submit to the will of the United States is an important task of Dulles' trip to Bangkok.

### 美国召开马尼拉条约国家曼谷会议的阴谋

    美国召开马尼拉条约国家曼谷会议的阴谋
    【新华社二十二日讯】美国召集的马尼拉条约国家的会议定于二月二十三日在泰国的曼谷举行。参加会议的有美国国务卿杜勒斯、英国外交大臣艾登、法国前驻美国大使庞纳以及澳大利亚、新西兰、巴基斯坦、菲律宾、泰国等国的外交部长。
    在会议召开的四天以前，菲律宾外交部长加西亚十九日在马尼拉宣布，参加马尼拉条约各国已经批准了这个条约，条约自当天起开始生效。早在一月三日，美国国务院就正式宣布将在曼谷举行马尼拉条约国家会议，以讨论实施这个条约的具体办法。美国甚至不等参加马尼拉条约的所有国家批准这个条约，就匆匆宣布召集曼谷会议来讨论实施马尼拉条约的具体办法，这充分地说明了美国是如何迫不及待地企图通过这次会议来加强在亚洲的侵略性军事力量，并加深亚洲的紧张气氛和分裂局面，以准备新的军事冒险。同时，美国选择在亚非会议开会之前召开曼谷会议也不是偶然的。因为，亚非会议所提供的亚非国家和平合作的前景，对于美国战争势力来说，是一个不利的前景。
    从西方通讯社所发表的消息中可以看出，军事问题在曼谷会议的议程上占有优先的位置。这些通讯社并不隐讳，曼谷会议的重要任务是给马尼拉条约集团装上“牙齿”，使它成为美国在亚洲进行侵略的工具。杜勒斯早在去年十二月底就宣布过，美国要在曼谷会议上建议成立马尼拉集团的“常设司令部”和一支“机动部队”。美联社记者在报道杜勒斯动身前往曼谷的消息中指出，杜勒斯是带着一份建立这种军事机构的计划到曼谷去的。
    消息透露，曼谷会议在策划军事活动的时候，将着重研究反对所谓“颠覆活动”的具体办法。据路透社报道，华盛顿方面的人士透露，这次会议将专门成立一个名为“反颠覆委员会”的“政治性的侦查机构”，企图借此加强特务活动，来镇压亚洲人民争取独立、自由和民主的斗争，同时在拒绝参加马尼拉条约的亚洲国家内部加紧进行颠覆活动，企图把这些国家拉入马尼拉集团。
    在杜勒斯启程到曼谷去的前夕，“纽约邮报”刊载的一条消息透露，美国打算建议召开一次马尼拉条约国家的军事代表会议来专门讨论印度支那问题。在此以前，已经有许多消息说，曼谷会议的主要目的之一就是商讨如何干涉印度支那。由于日内瓦协议所规定的越南全国普选日期日近，如何阻挠这一选举成为真正民主的自由选举，并把南越变成美国发动侵略冒险的基地，已经成为美国在东南亚的重要阴谋之一。为了具体部署这种破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋，杜勒斯已经宣布要在曼谷会议以后到南越、老挝和柬埔寨进行活动。
    同时，越来越多的消息透露，杜勒斯还打算同艾登和其他国家的代表在曼谷讨论台湾地区局势的问题。法新社消息指出，“杜勒斯将设法劝说东南亚条约组织的其他成员国把东南亚的安全和美国在台湾海峡的战略联系起来”。这就表明，美国还企图利用这次会议把它的“盟国”更紧地缚在美国侵略中国的战车上，迫使它们更直接地为美国侵占台湾的政策服务。
    为了掩盖曼谷会议的明显的军事性质，美国的宣传机器近来竭力散布一种论调，说会议还要讨论对亚洲国家的“经济援助”问题。美国和英国企图利用“经济援助”作为钓饵，来诱骗更多的东南亚国家参加马尼拉条约组织，并利用这种“援助”来在经济上控制亚洲国家。但是它们的这个手法并没有在亚洲国家中引起有利的反应。印度和锡兰等不少亚洲国家的舆论要求警惕美英的这种阴谋。“锡兰时报”指出，“在目前，再也没有什么东西比向美英在这方面的要求让步更足以使紧张局势加剧了”。
    在曼谷会议召开的前夕，西方通讯社和报纸对于将在会议上出现的分歧，正表现出越来越大的不安。它们指出，英国和美国在建立马尼拉集团军事力量方面怀抱着各自不同的打算。美国国际新闻社的消息说，英国所需要的是“建立一个它所能够控制的”马尼拉集团的军事机构。其他与会国家和美国之间以及它们彼此之间也存在着分歧。法新社在一条消息中指出，“（马尼拉条约的）八个成员国对于条约组织的目的的看法存在着分歧，在达到这些目的的方法上也都犹豫不决。”消息透露，对美国的这些三心两意的盟国施加压力，要它们屈从美国的意志，就是杜勒斯这次曼谷之行的重要任务。
