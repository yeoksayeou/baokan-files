    Winter Life in a Northern Village
    With the enormous development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, winter life in the countryside appears especially vibrant.
    In Guo Wangdu Village, Anyang County, Henan Province, 80% of the farming households have joined the Pioneer Agricultural Production Cooperative. Farmers are engaged in spring plowing preparations and worker-peasant get-togethers during the winter. The changes in the face of the new Chinese countryside can be seen from the winter activities of this village.

    The farmers warmly welcome the workers from the Yubei Textile Factory in Henan Province who have come to visit the village. The farmers are visiting the newly built agricultural tractor station in the village.
    The agricultural production cooperative has drawn a portion of its surplus labor force to fire bricks and tiles to supply the needs of urban capital construction.
    To guarantee a bumper harvest in this year's agricultural production, the cooperative has decided to accumulate 4.5 million jin of fertilizer during the winter. The members are working hard to accumulate fertilizer.

    北方一个农村的冬季生活
    随着互助合作运动的巨大发展，农村的冬季生活显得特别地活跃。
    河南省安阳县郭王度村有百分之八十的农户参加了先锋农业生产合作社，农民们在冬季进行了春耕准备工作和工农联欢。从这个农村的冬季活动中也可以看出新中国农村面貌的变化。

    农民们以无比的热情欢迎河南省豫北纺织厂的工人们到村里访问。农民们参观村里新建的农业拖拉机站。
    农业生产合作社里抽出了一部分多余的劳动力去烧砖瓦，供应城市基本建设的需要。
    为了保证今年农业生产的丰收，社里决定冬季积肥四百五十万斤。社员们正在努力积肥。
