    Caring for Model Workers
    The newspaper editorial department should conduct in-depth investigations and research on some major issues, produce materials with sufficient persuasiveness to draw attention to these major issues from all parties, and help all parties to solve these problems. In this way, the newspaper can better play the role of propagandist and organizer. The Shanghai Jiefang Daily's publicity over the past two months on solving the problem of model workers being too busy is an example.
    Model workers are outstanding individuals who have made significant contributions in production, and they are respected by the people. However, some people respect model workers not to enable them to play a greater exemplary role in production, but to pull them away from their production posts to participate in too many unnecessary social activities, thus affecting their production, learning, and rest. The Jiefang Daily, in its article "Who Should Be Responsible for Yi Shijuan's Busyness?" on December 19th of last year, raised this noteworthy situation. When the state-owned Shanghai No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory held its third-quarter labor competition award ceremony last year, Yi Shijuan, a national model worker in the textile industry, was not selected by everyone. It was not that Yi Shijuan was not as good as others in production, but because she only worked at the factory for a total of eighteen days in the third quarter, which did not meet the award conditions. Why is this happening? Just as the workers in Yi Shijuan's group described, their group leader came and went in a hurry like a "guest," and although her name was on the team roster, she was often away. Various places invited Yi Shijuan to meetings, give speeches, express her thoughts, and even cut ribbons and kick off (sports games). Yi Shijuan was held up by these social activities all day long, and therefore could not play a good exemplary role in production. However, the situation of Yi Shijuan being so "busy" is not an isolated case. Jiefang Daily, in articles such as "Why Drag Back Zhu Shunyu, Who is Ahead of Time?" also conducted continuous criticism of this issue.
    While exposing these serious phenomena, Jiefang Daily also published an editorial criticizing some people for treating model workers as "omnipotent heroes," using too many, even irrelevant, things, making it impossible for model workers to produce, learn, and rest. The editorial also put forward suggestions for changing this situation.
    After the newspaper's criticism, this issue has attracted the attention of some relevant units and has begun to be corrected. Yi Shijuan's "busy" situation has begun to ease after the newspaper's criticism. Some units have also made self-criticisms in the newspaper and decided to take effective measures to improve the shortcomings in their attitude towards model workers. It can be seen that as long as the newspaper has the spirit of investigation and research and puts forward pertinent opinions on pressing problems in real life, it can play a great role in promoting the resolution of these problems.

    关心劳动模范
    报纸编辑部对一些重大问题，应当进行深入的调查研究，拿出具有充分说服力的材料来引起各方面对这些重大问题的注意，并帮助各方面来解决这些问题。这样，报纸就能比较好地发挥宣传者和组织者的作用。上海解放日报近两个月来对于解决劳动模范忙乱问题的宣传，就是一个例子。
    劳动模范是在生产中有着重大贡献的优秀人物，他们受到人民群众的尊敬。但是有些人尊敬劳动模范，不是让他们在生产中发挥更大的模范作用，而是把他们从生产岗位上拉过来，参加过多的不必要的社会活动，因而影响了他们的生产、学习和休息。解放日报在去年十二月十九日“谁应该对裔式娟的忙负责任？”的文章中，就提出了这种值得注意的情况。国营上海第二棉纺织厂去年举行第三季度劳动竞赛评奖时，作为全国纺织工业劳动模范的裔式娟，竟没有被大家评上。并不是裔式娟在生产上不如别人，而是因为她在第三季度里总共只在厂工作了十八天，不符合评奖条件。为什么会有这种现象呢？正像裔式娟小组的工人形容的，她们的小组长来去匆忙得好像“客人”一样，名字虽然挂在组里，人却常在外边。各处请裔式娟开会、讲话、发表感想，甚至剪彩、开球（赛球）。裔式娟整天被这些社会活动拉住，因而不能很好地在生产上起模范作用。但是，像裔式娟这样“忙”的情况，并不是个别的。解放日报在“为什么要拖住走在时间前面的朱顺余？”等文章中，又对这个问题进行了连续的批评。
    解放日报在揭露这些严重现象的同时，还发表了社论，批评一些人把劳动模范当成“万能英雄”，用过多的甚至不相干的事，使得劳动模范不能生产，不能学习，不能休息。社论并提出了改变这种情况的意见。
    经过报纸的批评，这个问题已引起一些有关单位的重视，也开始得到改正。裔式娟的“忙”的情况，在报纸批评后已开始减轻。有的单位还在报上作了检讨，并决定采取有效措施，改进对待劳动模范态度上的缺点。可以看出，只要报纸具有调查研究的精神，对现实生活中迫切问题提出中肯的意见，对于解决这些问题是能够起很大的推动作用的。　（胡冰岳）
