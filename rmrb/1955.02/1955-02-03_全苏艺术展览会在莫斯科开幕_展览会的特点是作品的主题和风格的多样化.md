    展览会的特点是作品的主题和风格的多样化 【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：全苏艺术展览会最近在莫斯科开幕了。展览会上的两千多件艺术品分别在特列甲科夫艺术陈列馆、艺术工作者之家和苏联画家协会组织委员会大厅等三处展出。它们是苏联八百多个艺术家在最近两年中的新作，其中有油画、雕刻、版画、木刻、招贴画等。
    这个展览会的突出的特点是艺术作品的主题和风格的多样化。大多数展览品的主要题材是：社会主义建设、苏联人民的劳动功绩和他们的愉快的休息生活。许多到过开垦地区的画家创作了许多艺术作品，描绘苏联爱国者开垦荒地的光荣事业。以青年一代的家庭、爱情、友谊和教育为题材的作品，在展览品中也占有相当大的数量。有许多雕刻、绘画表现了各国人民争取和平的斗争。
    展览会还展出了苏联艺术家在访问中国、印度、保加利亚、朝鲜时所作的油画。
