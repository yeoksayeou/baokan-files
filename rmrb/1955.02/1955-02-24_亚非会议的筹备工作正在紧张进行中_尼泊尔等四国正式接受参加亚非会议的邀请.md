Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 23rd: Preparations for the Asian-African Conference, scheduled to be held in Bandung in April, are intensifying as the conference date approaches.

The people of Bandung and West Java Province are working hard to complete the various preparations for the conference. The sixteen sub-committees under the Bandung Local Preparatory Committee are busily engaged in preparations ranging from the construction work on the conference venue to the living arrangements of the delegates from various countries. President Sukarno recently visited Bandung in person to inspect the preparations for the conference.

The West Java branch of the All-Indonesia Labor Union issued a statement calling on all working people and people from other strata in Bandung and West Java Province to vigorously support the preparatory work for the Asian-African Conference and ensure the smooth progress of the conference. The statement also called on people to unite and thwart any conspiracies aimed at undermining the Asian-African Conference.

Workers are working hard to complete the repairs and expansion of the buildings selected as conference venues. New telephone lines are being erected everywhere in Bandung. On the highways from Bandung to Jakarta and nearby scenic spots, road workers are working hard to make the road surfaces smooth and even. Scenic spots near Bandung are also making preparations to receive delegates who will visit during the conference.

A broad plan to train various staff for the conference has begun to be implemented. According to this plan, many people who understand foreign languages such as English, Chinese, French, and Arabic are needed. The All-Indonesia Youth Association has guaranteed to send some young men and women who understand foreign languages to act as guides for foreign guests. Many young people and university students in Bandung have voluntarily signed up for this work.

Due to the expected heavy workload of telegrams and other communications during the conference, the Indonesian telecommunications authorities are drafting a detailed plan. It plans to establish telephone services with the other twenty-nine countries participating in the Asian-African Conference. The fastest way to deliver letters, photos, and other items is also being arranged. The telecommunications authorities also plan to set up a post and telecommunications department in the press room at the conference venue to operate day and night, so that news and photos about the conference from journalists from various countries can be quickly transmitted to all parts of the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 23rd: The Joint Secretariat of the Asian-African Conference announced on the 23rd that it had received formal responses from four more countries invited to participate in the Asian-African Conference, expressing their agreement to participate.
