    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 17th. According to Czechoslovak newspapers and news agencies, the Czechoslovak people are expressing their full support for the Chinese people's noble struggle to liberate Taiwan.

    The "Vit Nejedly Army Song and Dance Ensemble," winner of the State Prize and the Order of the Republic of Czechoslovakia, wrote a letter on February 15th to the Czechoslovak Committee for the Defense of Peace, saying: We will never agree to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang or the U.S. imperialists occupying Taiwan. "We declare: Our Chinese comrades, we are with you. In your just struggle against the aggressors, we are with you."

    Ili Beranovski, winner of the Order of the Republic of Czechoslovakia at the Sokolovo Machine Factory, pointed out: "From our experience in dealing with Hitler, we know that we cannot retreat in the face of the aggressors' desires and their blackmail. Therefore, we express our full support for our Chinese comrades. In their noble struggle for the glory and independence of their motherland, they can count on our help."

    Krizhanovitz, a worker at the Stalingrad Machine Manufacturing Factory, emphasized: "This struggle (to liberate Taiwan) is also our struggle, because we have a common enemy—U.S. imperialism."

      Vilinger, the foreman of the shock brigade at the "Avia-Letnany" Aircraft Factory, said: "It is not enough to simply say that we clearly know that Taiwan belongs to the People's China and that we know that U.S. imperialists are preparing to use West Germany as a springboard for a new war. We must create a force that the warmongers fear. We must strengthen our republic with our work so that it can become a strong bastion of peace."

    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 17th. According to the London "Daily Worker," the Renfrew (in Scotland) Municipal Council passed a resolution condemning U.S. interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China. The resolution suggested that the British government declare to the United States that Britain is unwilling to be drawn into U.S. actions.

    The Holden (in Durham County) Miners Local Organization and the Miners' Union, with 5,000 members, issued a statement to Foreign Secretary Eden: If Britain supports the U.S. military policy against the People's China, the miners will refuse to mine coal.

    Also protesting U.S. provocative actions in the Taiwan area are: Anniesland (in Glasgow) Women's Cooperative Guild, Glasgow Wholesale Cooperative Society, the Renfrew Branch of the National Union of Trade and Sales Assistants and Deliverymen, and the Renfrew Branch of the Draughtsmen's Union of the Machine Manufacturing and Shipbuilding Industry.

    According to a Xinhua News Agency report: Australia's "Tribune" in Sydney reported that a recent issue of the "Branch News" of the Sydney Branch of the Australian Waterside Workers' Federation stated: "How can people deny that the U.S. action of sailing the Seventh Fleet into the Chinese seas to demonstrate is not a direct provocation?" "Taiwan is to China as Tasmania is to Australia."

      "Tribune" also reported that in Kunla, near Cairns in North Queensland, slaughtermen held a meeting and unanimously condemned the U.S. government's attitude toward China. They demanded that the U.S. military withdraw from Taiwan and let the Chinese solve their own problems.

    In Gundi, near Innisfail, seventy sugar mill workers and dockworkers also unanimously demanded that the Australian government "use its influence to stop U.S. aggression in Taiwan." A general meeting of sugar mill workers in South Johnstone passed a resolution demanding that U.S. aggression in Taiwan be stopped.

    Xinhua News Agency, February 17th. According to the February 9th "People's Voice," the New Zealand Railway Employees' Union, one of New Zealand's largest unions, representing 15,000 of New Zealand's 26,000 railway workers, expressed opposition to any interference in Taiwan at its recent national congress.

    The resolution passed by the congress stated that interference in Taiwan would be tantamount to interfering in a civil war. "Given the need to stop hostilities and seek a more peaceful solution, it is now clear that China should obtain its legitimate seat in the United Nations." The resolution also said: "The meeting reaffirms the policy of the Railway Employees' Union that resolving international problems by war is futile; the meeting expresses concern about the possibility of conflict in Taiwan and Southeast Asia."

      "People's Voice" said that another union, the Auckland Northern Drivers' Union, recently formally expressed opposition to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the ANZUS Treaty, and will also ask the next meeting of the New Zealand Federation of Labour to oppose these treaties and the rearmament of West Germany. The annual meeting of the New Zealand Federation of Labour, representing more than 200,000 workers, will be held in May.

    The Queensland Labor Conference in Australia also passed a resolution calling for China to be admitted to the United Nations.

      “阿维亚—列特纳尼”飞机工厂的突击小组的领班维林格说：“仅仅说，我们明确地知道台湾是属于人民中国的，我们知道美帝国主义者准备把西德作为进行新战争的跳板，是不够的。我们必须创造使战争贩子害怕的一种力量。我们必须用我们的工作来加强我们的共和国，使它可以成为和平的坚强堡垒。”

      “人民之声报”说，另外一个工会，奥克兰北部司机工会，在最近正式表示反对东南亚条约组织和澳新美条约，它还将要求新西兰劳工联合会的下届会议反对这些条约，并且反对西德重新武装。代表着二十万以上工人的新西兰劳工联合会年会将在五月举行。
