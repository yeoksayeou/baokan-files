    Today's Shanghai Market
    Opening today's Shanghai newspapers, one can see that the retail prices of all major daily necessities listed on the "market report" are generally maintained at the level of 1952, before the start of the First Five-Year Plan. Today, a Shanghai citizen with 10,000 yuan can buy, just like two or three years ago, more than six *jin* of Zhongbai *Jing* rice, more than three *chi* and six *cun* of "Dragon Head" fine cloth, more than 35 *jin* of "Unified" coal briquettes, or nearly seven cakes of "Worker-Peasant" brand laundry soap. According to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Commerce, the retail prices of these major daily necessities have not changed for 19 to 25 months.
    According to the retail prices published by state-owned companies in today's Shanghai newspaper "market report," citizens can also buy goods in many private shops. On the busiest Nanjing Road in Shanghai, next to large-scale state-owned stores and cooperatives, one can see private retail stores with signs of state-owned company distributors, or paper strips on the windows stating that they are commissioned by state-owned companies as exclusive counters, and that all commodities of a certain type are sold at state-owned prices. More than 18,000 private retail stores in Shanghai in nineteen industries, including grain, cotton cloth, cooking oil, and small commodities, have established distribution, wholesale, and consignment relationships with state-owned commerce. In Shanghai's small vegetable markets, which have always had the most chaotic prices, there are now signs with unified prices, because state-owned food companies and cooperatives have control of the sources of non-staple foods. Although there was rain and snow around this year's Spring Festival, housewives still bought large quantities of chicken, duck, fish, meat, and various vegetables at stable prices.

    今日的上海市场
    翻开今天的上海报纸，可以看到所有“行情”表上刊载的各项主要生活用品的零售价格，大致还保持着第一个五年建设计划开始前一九五二年的水平。今天，上海市民拿一张一万元的人民币，可以和二三年前一样，买到六斤多中白粳大米，三尺六寸多龙头细布，三十五斤多“统一”煤球，或者近七块工农牌洗衣皂。根据上海市商业局资料的记载，这些主要生活用品的零售价格，已经有十九个月到二十五个月没有变动了。
    按照今天上海报纸“行情”表上刊出的国营公司的零售牌价，市民们也可以在许多私营商店里买到商品。在上海最热闹的南京路上，在规模宏大的国营商店和合作社的旁边，都可以看到私营零售店的门前，挂着国营公司经销店的牌子，或者在橱窗上贴着国营公司特约专柜代销、某类商品全部按国营牌价出售的纸条。上海已经有粮食、棉布、食油、小百货等十九个行业的一万八千多家私营零售店，和国营商业建立了经销、批购、代销关系。在向来价格最混乱的上海的小菜场上，由于国营食品公司和合作社掌握了副食品的来源，现在也有了标着统一价目的牌子。今年春节前后虽然雨雪交加，主妇们还是按稳定的价格买到大量鸡鸭鱼肉和各种菜蔬。
