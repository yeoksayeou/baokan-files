    Teachers at Beijing Normal University Criticize Hu Shi's Thought
    The work of criticizing the idealist viewpoints in "Dream of the Red Chamber" research and criticizing Hu Shi's reactionary theoretical influence in literature, history, and pedagogy has been deeply unfolded at Beijing Normal University. Many professors have drafted research topics in this area and have written or are writing articles. Professor Zhong Jingwen, director of the Research Department, has written a special article entitled "Criticizing Hu Shi's Views and Methods in Folk Literature Research." Professor Huang Yaomian, head of the Chinese Department, is writing an article entitled "Hu Shi was a Saboteur of the New Literature Camp from the Very Beginning," and professors from the Classical Literature Group have also begun writing. The History Department recently held a faculty meeting to specifically discuss how to carry out work in this area, and fifteen teachers have now selected eight research topics. For example, Professor Bai Shouyi, director of the Teaching and Research Office of Chinese Ancient and Medieval History, is researching the topic of "The Position of Textual Research in Historical Research," Professor Zhao Guangxian's research topic is "Hu Shi's Views and Methods on Ancient Chinese History," Associate Professor He Ziquan is researching "Hu Shi's Discussion on the History of the Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties," and Peng Qiongxi and Li Shulan are researching "Hu Shi's Views on Women's Issues," etc. These research topics will all be completed between February and June of this year.
    The pedagogical Teaching and Research Office has already begun researching the following topics: "The Reactionary Nature of Hu Shi's Thought," "A Critique of Pragmatic Pedagogy," and "On the Poisonous Effects of Dewey on Education in Old China," etc.

    批判“红楼梦”研究中的唯心论观点和批判胡适在文学、史学、教育学方面的反动理论影响的工作，已在北京师范大学深入展开。许多教授已拟出这方面的研究专题，写出或正在写文章。研究部主任钟敬文教授已写出了一篇题为“批判胡适在民间文学研究上的观点和方法”的专文。中文系系主任黄药眠教授正在写一篇题为“胡适从一开始就是新文艺阵营的破坏分子”的文章，古典文学组的教授们也已动笔。历史系在最近召开了教师会议，专门讨论了如何展开这方面工作的问题，现已有十五位教师选定了八个研究专题，如中国古代及中世纪史教研室主任白寿彝教授研究的题目是“考据在历史研究中的地位”，赵光贤教授的研究题是“胡适对中国古史的观点和方法”，何兹全副教授研究“胡适关于汉魏六朝史的论述”，彭琼熙、李书兰研究“胡适对妇女问题的观点”等。这些研究专题，将在今年二月至六月间全部完成。
    教育学教研室已经开始研究的专题有：“胡适思想的反动性”、“实用主义教育学批判”，以及“论杜威对旧中国教育的毒害”等。
