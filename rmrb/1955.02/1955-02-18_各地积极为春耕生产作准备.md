Various regions are actively preparing for this year's spring plowing and production. The seeds needed for spring sowing have been largely resolved. Seven provinces, including Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, and Hebei, which suffered relatively severe disasters, have already stored 800 million jin of grain and oil crop seeds. Shandong, Jilin, Rehe, Tianjin and other places which originally lacked spring sowing seeds have now also stored nearly 200 million jin. The potato seeds needed by Anhui, Liaoning and other provinces, and the late soybean seeds needed by Hubei are being resolved. The cotton seeds needed by various regions have also been basically resolved. With the development of mutual assistance and cooperation, the demand for new-style animal-powered farm implements has greatly increased. The number of new-style animal-powered farm implements planned to be promoted in Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces this year is more than the total number promoted in previous years. Farmers in Henan and Hebei not only require a large number of double-wheeled double-shared plows and sowing machines, harvesters, etc., but also require a large number of seven-inch walking plows and eight-inch walking plows. Now, various provinces are actively preparing new-style animal-powered farm implements to be promoted this spring, and have established agricultural technology promotion stations and farm implement stations to guide farmers in production. The manure accumulation work in many provinces was done well last winter. Zhejiang Province estimates that the fertilizer accumulated before the year increased by 20% compared with the same period last year. Shandong Province has vigorously promoted the accumulation of urine fertilizer with remarkable results. The work of raising pigs and accumulating manure in various places has also developed. Twenty-nine counties and cities in Liaoning Province have collected and stored a large amount of coarse feed, which can raise 220,000 pigs, which will produce a large amount of fertilizer. Southern provinces, in conjunction with water conservancy construction, carried out patriotic health campaigns, advocating the construction of pigpens for manure accumulation, and also accumulated a large amount of fertilizer. According to statistics from more than 500 mutual aid groups and cooperatives in Yiwu County, Zhejiang Province, while building small-scale water conservancy projects, they carried more than 6 million dan of pond mud for use as base fertilizer. Many places have insufficient fertilizer accumulation and are now trying to make up for it. In order to subsidize the insufficient fertilizer accumulation of farmers in various places, the state has prepared a large number of commercial fertilizers. This year's supply of cake fertilizer will increase by 26% compared with last year. According to incomplete statistics from nine provinces including Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Henan, Guangdong, and Shaanxi, half of the cake fertilizer held before the year has been supplied to various regions. The national chemical fertilizer supply plan has also increased by 23% compared with last year, and more than half of the chemical fertilizers can be supplied before spring plowing. The organized farmers need a large increase in draft animals. In order to meet this need, supply and marketing cooperatives in 14 provinces including Liaoning, Hebei, and Shandong signed an exchange agreement for 161,000 draft animals in January. In addition, the work of adjusting draft animals within various provinces is also actively underway. Before mid-January, Jiangxi Province had adjusted 24,800 head of cattle within the province, and Hubei Province will also adjust 20,000 head of cattle within the province before spring plowing. During the spring plowing period, various places are also preparing to use temporary livestock to help plow, exchange labor between people and animals, hire plows, and borrow plows to solve the difficulties of some households lacking livestock.

    各地积极为春耕生产作准备
    各地正积极为今年春耕生产作准备。今春播种中所需的种籽已经大体解决。江苏、安徽、湖南、湖北、江西、河南及河北等七个受灾较重的省，已经储备了八亿斤粮食和油料作物的种籽。山东、吉林、热河及天津等地原来缺乏春播种籽，现在也已储备近二亿斤。安徽、辽宁等省所需的马铃薯种、湖北所需的迟黄豆种等正在设法解决。各地所需棉种也已基本解决。随着互助合作的发展，新式畜力农具的需要量大增。黑龙江和辽宁省今年计划推广的新式畜力农具比以往各年推广的总数还多。河南、河北的农民不但要求大量双轮双铧犁和播种机、收割机等，而且还需要大量的七吋步犁和八吋步犁。现在各省正积极准备今春要推广的新式畜力农具，而且纷纷建立农业技术推广站及农具站，准备指导农民生产。去冬许多省的积肥工作作得较好。浙江省估计年前所积肥料较前年同期增加了百分之二十。山东省大力提倡积尿肥已有显著成效。各地养猪积肥的工作也有发展，辽宁省有二十九个县市采集与贮备了大量粗饲料，可养二十二万口猪，这些猪将产生大量肥料。南方各省结合兴修水利，开展爱国卫生运动，提倡修圈积肥，也增积了大量肥料。据浙江省义乌县五百多个互助组、合作社统计，在兴修小型水利同时，挑了塘泥六百多万担，用作基肥。许多地方积肥不足，现正设法补足。为了补助各地农家积肥的不足，国家已准备了大量商品肥料。今年饼肥的供应量将比去年增加百分之二十六。据河北、山西、山东、江苏、浙江、安徽、河南、广东、陕西等九省不完全统计，年前所掌握的饼肥有一半已供应各地。全国化学肥料供应计划也较去年增加百分之二十三，半数以上的化学肥料可于春耕前供应下去。组织起来的农民需要的耕畜大增。为了满足这一需要，辽宁、河北、山东等十四个省的供销社于一月份签订了十六万一千头耕畜的交流协议。此外，各省省内调剂耕畜的工作也正在积极进行。江西省一月中旬以前已在省内调剂了两万四千八百头耕牛，湖北省春耕前也要在省内调剂耕牛两万头。春耕期间各地还准备用临时牲畜插犋、人畜换工、雇犋、借犋等办法解决一部分缺畜户的困难。
