A letter from the Zhangshu Lumberyard of the Jiangxi Forestry Bureau: The People's Daily criticized our lumberyard for not properly storing wood, and we sincerely accept this criticism. For a long time, we have held erroneous ideas such as "emphasizing river transport over the storage yard, and emphasizing allocation over preservation." In the future, in addition to conducting serious self-criticism of these erroneous ideas, we have decided to thoroughly carry out mass wood safety inspections, completely correct bureaucratic work styles, establish and improve various systems (especially the responsibility system), improve various stacking methods, and regularly pay attention to restacking and inspection to prevent wood decay and other losses.

    樟树集材场开始注意木材防腐工作
    江西森林工业局樟树集材场来信：人民日报曾对我场没有保管好木材一事进行了批评，我们诚恳地接受这一批评。在较长时期以来，我们存有“重河下，轻货场，重调拨、轻保管”等错误思想，今后，我们除对这种错误思想进行严肃认真的检查批评外，决定深入开展群众性的木材安全检查，彻底纠正官僚主义的工作作风，建立和健全各种制度（特别是责任制），改进各种堆楞方法，并经常注意翻堆和检查，防止木材腐朽等损失。
