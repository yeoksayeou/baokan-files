    The so-called "policy of strength" of a handful of warmongers in the United States has never frightened anyone with a clear mind, yet they seem unable to control their ferocious nature. For months, in London, Paris, Seoul, and in their own Congress, their commanders, generals, and even the president have clamored to use atomic weapons to attack the Soviet Union, China, and Korea. And along with this clamor, they have shamelessly intensified their armed intervention in our internal affairs, obstructing our liberation of Taiwan.
    However, on January 14th, the Soviet Union announced its willingness to submit a report to an international conference on the situation of its first atomic energy industrial power station in order to promote the experience of using atomic energy for peaceful purposes. Three days later, it followed up with a statement that it was willing to provide China, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and the German Democratic Republic with scientific, technological, and industrial assistance in promoting the peaceful uses of atomic energy.
    Any intimidation and obstruction of the just cause of mankind by the imperialists can only arouse the indignation of peace-loving people all over the world; while the radiant and just declaration of the Soviet Union has been warmly welcomed by peace-loving people all over the world.
    As a scientific worker, I deeply realize that any scientific achievement is obtained through hard work. The discovery of atomic energy is an even greater achievement of scientists' long and continuous work, bringing unlimited happiness to the future of mankind. But now, this handful of warmongers attempts to seize this scientific achievement and use it to destroy human happiness, wanting to use the atomic bomb as a "magic weapon" to scare us, so that we dare not liberate our own territory of Taiwan. I advise them to wake up; the Chinese people who have stood up will not be intimidated by this kind of bluffing clamor; the powerful peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, as well as peace-loving and justice-upholding people all over the world, will support our reasonable action of recovering our own territory. The peace-loving Chinese people certainly oppose war, but will never change our established policy because of this unjust war clamor. From the way of utilizing scientific achievements, the different positions of internationalists and imperialists are very obvious. I cannot help but feel anger towards the American aggressors and gratitude towards the selfless Soviet Union. Like all the Chinese people, I resolutely support the Soviet Union and the world's progressive humanity's policy of peaceful utilization of atomic energy, and will forever stand in the great struggle of the world to ban atomic weapons and smash new war conspiracies!

    国际主义者和帝国主义者利用科学的本质上的差异
    中国科学院语言研究所所长  全国人民代表大会代表  罗常培
    美国的一小撮好战分子的所谓“实力政策”是从来吓不倒任何神志清楚的人的，然而他们似乎再也无法控制穷凶极恶的本性了。几个月以来，在伦敦、在巴黎、在汉城、在他们自己的国会里，他们的司令、将军以至总统都叫嚣着要用原子武器来攻击苏联，中国和朝鲜。而且跟这叫嚣同时，无耻地加紧武装干涉我国内政，阻挠我们解放台湾。
    但是，苏联一月十四日却宣布了：愿意向国际会议提出关于他的第一个原子能工业电力站的情况报告，以便推广原子能用于和平事业的经验。三日以后又接着声明，愿意在促进原子能和平用途方面给中国、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚和德意志民主共和国以科学、技术和工业上的帮助。
    帝国主义者对人类的正义事业的任何恐吓和阻挠，只能引起全世界爱好和平人民的愤恨；而苏联光芒四射的正义宣告，却受到了全世界爱好和平人民的热烈欢迎。
    作为一个科学工作者，我切实体会到任何科学成果都是通过辛勤劳动得来的。原子能的发现更是科学家们长期不断工作的伟大收获，它给人类的前途带来无限幸福。可是现在这一小撮好战分子企图霸占这个科学成果，用来毁灭人类的幸福，想拿原子弹当作“法宝”吓住我们，使我们不敢去解放自己的领土台湾。我劝他们醒一醒；站起来的中国人是不会被这种虚张声势的叫嚣吓倒的；以苏联为首的强大的和平民主阵营以及全世界爱好和平、拥护正义的人民是会支持我们这一收回自己领土的合理举动的。爱好和平的中国人民固然反对战争，但是也决不会因为这种违反正义的战争叫嚣改变我们既定的政策。从怎样利用科学的成果来分析，国际主义者和帝国主义者不同的立场是很显然的。我禁不住对美国侵略者的愤怒和对大公无私的苏联的感激。我跟全体中国人民一样，坚决拥护苏联和全世界进步人类和平利用原子能的政策，永远站在全世界禁止原子武器、粉碎新战争阴谋的巨大斗争行列中！
