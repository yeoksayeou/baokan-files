Suzhou, Jiangsu Province produces silk, and over 76,000 bolts of it were exported last year. Calculated at two bolts of silk exchanging for one ton of steel, this silk can be exchanged for over 38,000 tons of steel.

    The silk produced by the Suzhou Motorized Silk Weaving Factory is famous for its bright colors and beautiful patterns, and sells well in foreign markets. Last year, the factory produced more than 20 kinds of precious silks, such as soft satin, Liuxiang crepe, and taffeta, which were all products specifically for export; these varieties accounted for 88.79% of all products. The quality of silk was also improved last year, and the rate of substandard products decreased from 40% to about 20%. The export qualification rate of taffeta has reached 98.7%.

    This year, the factory's processing tasks have increased by a quarter compared to last year, and many new products and more than 40 new patterns have been added, such as Hua Guang Ling, Su Guang Ling, Double Tube Gauze, and Meili Silk. The first batch of new products produced by the factories this year has been shipped to Shanghai and sold abroad.

    苏州绸缎大量出口
    江苏省苏州市出产的绸缎，去年一年出口了七万六千多匹。按两匹绸缎换一吨钢材计算，这些绸缎共可换回钢材三万八千多吨。
    苏州市电机织绸厂生产的绸缎，以色彩鲜艳、花式美丽闻名，畅销于国外市场。去年各厂生产的软缎、留香绉、塔夫绸等二十多种名贵绸缎，都是专供出口的产品；这些品种占全部产品的百分之八十八点七九。绸缎的质量去年也提高了，次货率从百分之四十降低到百分之二十左右。塔夫绸的出口合格率已经达到百分之九十八点七。
    今年各厂加工任务比去年增加四分之一，增加了花广绫、素广绫、双管绡、美丽绸等许多种新产品和四十多本新花样。各厂今年生产的第一批新产品已经运到上海，销往国外。
