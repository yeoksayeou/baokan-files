A Suggestion for Saving Coal by Modifying Boilers

To the Editors:

I used to work at the Taiyuan branch of the People's Bank of China and was transferred to the Qingdao branch last year. After arriving at the Qingdao branch, I found it very convenient to have hot water readily available. The water-boiling boilers here provide hot water at any time, unlike in Taiyuan, where you have to wait for more than half an hour to get hot water. Later, when I had the opportunity to go to Taiyuan, I intentionally inquired about it and found that the boilers used by the Taiyuan branch and the Qingdao branch differed in terms of heating water and coal consumption. The tea boiler at the Qingdao branch has a water capacity of 450 jin, and it consumes less than 70 jin of coal dust per day, which can supply drinking water for more than 400 people in the entire branch. The boiler used by the Taiyuan branch has a water capacity of more than 600 jin and consumes about 250 jin of coal lumps per day, but it can only provide drinking water for 300 people in the entire branch. Isn't there a lot of waste with the Taiyuan branch's boiler?

To clarify this issue, I conducted some research on the boilers used in these two locations and found that the boiler used by the Qingdao branch has many advantages worth introducing to everyone.

The two types of boilers used by the Qingdao branch and the Taiyuan branch seem the same on the surface, but their structures are actually different. Both types of boilers are cylindrical iron furnaces about four to five feet high and six to seven feet in circumference. There is a chimney with a diameter of about five inches in the center of the furnace, and the water outlet switch is installed in the middle of the furnace. Other parts such as the fire door, fire cover, and vent pipe are also the same. However, the only difference is the height of the cold water inlet switch valve. The water inlet of the boiler used by the Taiyuan branch is placed on the top of the furnace, while the water inlet of the boiler used by the Qingdao branch is connected to a water pipe from the side, which guides the cold water to the bottom of the furnace and injects it from the side. This is the main reason why the Qingdao branch's furnace saves coal.

Why is that? Because cold water has a high density and heavy weight. If it is injected from the top of the furnace, it immediately makes the boiling water in the furnace undrinkable. However, if cold water is injected from the bottom of the furnace, it is easy to push the less dense and lighter boiling water to the top because the cold water is heavier than the boiling water. This ensures a continuous supply of hot water. Of course, the amount of cold water injected at one time should not be too much, because a small amount of cold water near the bottom of the furnace heats up quickly and is easy to boil. I think if all regions pay attention to improving the way boilers are filled with water, they can save a lot of coal for the country, and the supply of hot water can also be timely.

### 改装锅炉节省用煤的一项建议

    改装锅炉节省用煤的一项建议编辑同志：
    我原来在中国人民银行太原分行工作，去年被调到青岛分行。到青岛分行以后，在日常生活中，我感到用开水非常方便，这里的烧水锅炉可以随时有开水用，不像在太原一样，要一等半个多钟头才能有开水。后来我有机会到太原去的时候，有意地了解了一下，发现太原分行用的锅炉和青岛分行用的锅炉在烧热水和用煤量上都有些不同。青岛分行的茶炉容水量是四百五十斤，每日烧煤末不到七十斤，可以供应全行四百多人的饮水。太原分行用的锅炉容水量是六百多斤，每日烧煤块二百五十斤左右，只能供给全行三百人的饮水。那么，太原分行的锅炉不是有很大的浪费吗？
    为了弄清楚这个问题，我对这两个地方用的锅炉进行了一番研究，发现青岛分行用的锅炉有许多优点，值得向大家介绍。
    青岛分行和太原分行的两种锅炉，在表面上看起来似乎是一样的，但实际上它们的构造是不同的。这两种锅炉都是四、五尺高，圆周约六、七尺的圆柱形铁炉，炉中央有个口径约五寸的烟筒，出水开关安装在炉子的中部，其他如火门、火盖、放气管等也都是相同的。但唯一不同的地方，就是注入冷水的开关闸有高低之分。太原分行用的锅炉入水口是安置在炉顶上的，青岛分行用的锅炉的入水口却是从旁边顺下一根水管子，把冷水引到炉底而从旁注入炉子里面的。这就是青岛分行的炉子节省煤的主要原因。
    为什么呢？因为，冷水的密度大分量重，如果从炉顶注入，立刻就使炉里沸腾着的开水变得不能喝了。但是，如果把冷水从炉底注入，由于冷水比开水重，就很容易把密度小而分量轻的开水推到上面去，这样，就可以保证经常不间断地供应开水。当然，一次注入的冷水也不宜过多，因为少量的凉水接近炉底受热很快，容易煮沸。我想，如果各地都注意改进锅炉的加水办法，就可以为国家节省大量烧煤，而供应开水也能适时了。袁振华
