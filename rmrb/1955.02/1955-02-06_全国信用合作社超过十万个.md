    National Credit Cooperatives Exceed 100,000

    [This Report] In the past year, credit cooperative organizations across the country have seen significant development. According to incomplete statistics from the Head Office of the People's Bank of China, there are currently more than 100,000 credit cooperatives nationwide, with nearly 60 million members. Compared with the end of 1953, the number of credit cooperatives has increased tenfold, and the number of members has increased ninefold. In addition, there are more than 38,000 credit mutual aid groups and more than 2,200 credit departments attached to supply and marketing cooperatives across the country. Now, there is an average of one credit cooperative for every two townships nationwide; in Shanxi, Hebei, Zhejiang, Fujian, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Guangxi, Shaanxi and other provinces, there is an average of more than one credit cooperative for each township. Credit cooperative organizations in remote areas and ethnic minority areas such as Inner Mongolia, Guizhou, and Xinjiang have also developed relatively rapidly. At present, credit cooperatives in various regions have approximately 870 billion yuan in share capital, more than five times the amount at the end of 1953. In areas where credit cooperative work is well-developed, the amount of deposits absorbed and loans issued by credit cooperatives is roughly the same as the amount of rural savings absorbed and agricultural loans issued by state banks. At the end of last year, the deposits transferred by credit cooperatives nationwide to state banks reached 1.9 trillion yuan. Through deposit absorption and loan issuance activities, credit cooperatives in various regions have powerfully promoted the development and consolidation of agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation organizations, helped individual farmers solve difficulties in production and livelihood, and severely cracked down on usury activities. At present, in addition to continuing to develop credit cooperative organizations in a planned manner, various regions are also leading the established credit cooperatives to carry out rectification and consolidation work through holding credit cooperative representative meetings and running training courses, actively preparing to serve spring plowing production.

    全国信用合作社超过十万个
    【本报讯】一年来全国信用合作组织有了很大的发展。据中国人民银行总行不完全的统计，目前全国已经有信用合作社十万零五千多个，社员近六千万人。同一九五三年年底比较，信用合作社增加了十倍，社员增加了九倍。另外，全国还有三万八千多个信用互助组和二千二百多个附设在供销合作社的信用部。现在，全国平均两个乡有一个信用合作社；山西、河北、浙江、福建、河南、湖北、湖南、江西、广西、陕西等省平均一个多乡就有一个信用合作社。内蒙古、贵州、新疆等边远地区和少数民族地区的信用合作组织也有了相当迅速的发展。各地信用合作社现在已经有股金约八千七百亿元，比一九五三年底增加五倍多。信用合作工作开展较好的地区，信用合作社吸收存款和发放贷款的数量同国家银行吸收农村储蓄款和发放农贷的数字大体上相同。去年年底，全国信用合作社转存到国家银行的存款就有一万九千亿元。各地信用合作社通过吸收存款和发放贷款的活动，有力地促进了各地农业生产互助合作组织的发展和巩固，帮助个体农民解决了生产和生活上的困难，并严重地打击了高利贷活动。目前，各地除有计划地继续发展信用合作组织外，还通过召开信用合作社代表会议、举办训练班等方式，领导已经建立起来的信用合作社进行整顿和巩固工作，积极准备为春耕生产服务。
