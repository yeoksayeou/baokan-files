To the Editor:

	In late January of last year, the Third Work Area of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Engineering Company in Shanxi Province sent a registered letter to Li Chongli of the Ma’anshan Iron and Steel Plant. Unexpectedly, on August 2nd, the Personnel Section of the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant wrote "No Such Person, Return to Sender" in large characters on the envelope and sent the letter back. After the sender re-sent the letter, the recipient's family finally brought the money order enclosed in the letter to the post office to cash it in late November. By this time, the money order had long exceeded the prescribed validity period and had to be sent back to the original issuing post office to exchange for a new one. The recipient's family sighed and said, "Even communication becomes a problem when cadres are temporarily transferred."

	This phenomenon is not an isolated case. In August of last year, Ding Zhaoyi of Andong City sent a parcel to Ding Zhaohui of the Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Plant Hospital, which was returned to the post office with the words "This comrade has been transferred." It was only after the post office inquired about the recipient's new address that the parcel was delivered. As for ordinary letters being returned casually, there are even more instances of that.

	If the original unit forwards a letter promptly after a cadre is transferred, it is an easy task. But why are the above-mentioned units so indifferent to comrades who have been transferred?

### “查无此人，退回原处”

    “查无此人，退回原处”编辑同志：
    去年一月下旬，山西太原钢铁厂工程公司第三工区寄给马鞍山铁厂李崇礼挂号信一件。不料到八月二日，马鞍山铁厂人事科在信封上批了“查无此人，退回原处”八个大字，就把信退走了。经寄件人再次把信寄来，十一月下旬收件人的家属才拿了信中所寄的汇票来邮局兑款。这时汇票早超过规定的有效期限，需寄回原发票邮局调换新票。收件人家属叹气说：“干部临时调动一下工作，竟连通信都成了问题。”
    这种现象并不是个别的。去年八月，安东市丁兆义寄给马鞍山铁厂医院丁兆会包裹一件，被批上“该同志已调动工作”几个大字退回邮局；经邮局查询收件人的新通讯处，才把包裹寄达。至于平信被随便退回的，那就更多了。
    一个干部调动了工作，如果原单位收信以后及时转寄，这是轻而易举的事。但是，为什么以上这些单位对待已调动工作的同志这样漠不关心呢？
