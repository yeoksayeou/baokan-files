The State-owned Friendship Farm is stepping up its preparations for basic construction this year. According to the regulations of the State Council, its main basic construction projects, such as offices, employee residences and some family dormitories, garages, grain warehouses, repair shops, power stations, and expert guest houses, must be completed this year. The construction area of these projects totals more than 60,000 square meters, accounting for more than half of the total construction area planned for the farm.

To ensure the successful completion of the above tasks, the State-owned Friendship Farm, with the support of all relevant parties, has made full preparations over the past two months. The Mudanjiang Engineering Company, which contracted for all the construction work, sent people to the construction site on January 4 to collect various construction data, and returned to Mudanjiang City on the 14th. Recently, they will send some personnel to the site to carry out temporary construction and compile construction organization designs. The stone, red bricks, and wood needed for the project are also being prepared. In order to reduce construction costs and extend the service life of buildings, a large amount of stone will be used in the construction of some major projects this year. The planned demand for stone is more than 40,000 cubic meters. Now, more than 300 workers from state-owned farms such as Erlongshan, Hongxing, and Baoquanling, who came to support the farm in quarrying, have arrived at the Xinglongshan site and are carrying out quarrying work. Of the more than 9 million red bricks needed for basic construction this year, 6 million have been contracted with the Jixian County Enterprise Company to be supplied by the company, and the other 3 million red bricks that the farm will raise itself have also been located and are ready to be fired. Of the 9,000 cubic meters of wood needed for basic construction this year, the state has allocated more than 5,000 cubic meters, and the other 4,000 cubic meters have been contracted to local people for harvesting. In the next few days, the transportation of materials to the construction site will be fully launched. According to the plan, more than 80 trucks and thousands of rubber-wheeled carts will be used in shifts for transportation. Large-scale basic construction work can begin in mid-March.

    国营友谊农场进行基本建设施工准备工作
    国营友谊农场今年基本建设的施工准备工作正在加紧进行。按照国务院的规定，它的主要基本建设工程如办公室、职工住宅及部分家属宿舍、汽车库、粮食仓库、修理厂、发电站、专家招待所等工程，都要在今年内建成。这些工程的建筑面积共达六万余平方公尺，占到了该场计划中全部建筑面积的一半以上。
    为保证胜利完成上述任务，两个多月以来，国营友谊农场在各有关方面的支援下，已进行了充分的准备工作。承包全部建筑工程的牡丹江工程公司，一月四日派人前往施工地点搜集各种施工资料，已在十四日返回了牡丹江市。最近，他们即将派出部分人员到达现场，进行临时工程的修建和编制施工组织设计工作。至于工程所需的石料、红砖、木材等，现也在加紧准备中。为减低建筑成本并延长建筑物使用年限，在今年所进行的一些主要工程中将大量采用石料进行建筑。计划中需要的石料达四万多立方公尺。现在，来支援农场采石的国营二龙山、红星、宝泉岭等农场的三百多名工人已到达了兴隆山现场，正在进行采石工作。今年基本建设所需要的九百多万块红砖，除六百万块已和集贤县企业公司签订了合同由该公司供给外，另由农场自筹的三百万块红砖，现也已找好地址，准备烧制。今年基本建设所需的九千立方公尺木材，除国家拨给五千多立方公尺外，另四千立方公尺的木材已由当地群众包采。最近几日内，往施工现场的运料工作就要全面展开。根据计划，将有八十多辆汽车和上千辆胶轮大车轮班进行运输。三月中旬大规模基本建设工作即可开始进行。
