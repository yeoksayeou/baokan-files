    Strange Phenomena in Railway Transportation
    Ding Guangeng
    There is a very strange phenomenon in railway transportation now -- many stations are desperately pursuing more cars when transporting goods, regardless of how much cargo is actually loaded on these cars.

    For example, large-tonnage freight cars should carry heavier goods, such as grain, fertilizer, mineral building materials, coal, etc.; small-tonnage covered wagons should carry lighter goods, such as cotton, tobacco leaves, livestock, etc. However, some railway dispatching offices and stations, in order to make up the number of cars, have violated the principle of rational use of freight cars. At the end of September last year, the Zhuzhou Transportation Sub-bureau dispatching office ordered Changsha North Station to use five 50-ton cars to load pigs, with only 16 tons loaded on each car. On September 27, the Xuchang Station of the Zhengzhou Transportation Sub-bureau had four 40-ton covered wagons. The station did not use them to load grain, which could have fully utilized the load-carrying capacity of the freight cars, but instead used them to load tobacco leaves, loading only a sparse 20 tons per car. On October 11 last year, the Rihui Port Station of the Shanghai Transportation Sub-bureau received eight 50-ton empty cars sent from Shanghai East Station. At that time, the station had 300 tons of fertilizer, but this station used ten 30-ton cars to transport the 300 tons of fertilizer, and sent the eight 50-ton cars back empty. With such a "flexible" allocation, four more carloads were completed in one fell swoop.

    Some stations, in order to make up the number of cars loaded, are unwilling to promote advanced loading methods. The station master of Shunyi Station of the Beijing Railway Administration is unwilling to promote the double-layer pig loading method, because one car with double layers counts as two single layers, and loading one car with double layers will reduce the number of cars loaded by one. The station master of Xuchang Station said: If the double-layer pig loading method is promoted, the number of cars loaded will be reduced by more than 100 each month. Further promotion will make it impossible for us to complete our loading task.

    Railway regulations stipulate that a 30-ton freight car can carry 10 to 16 head of cattle, and can be appropriately increased or decreased depending on the size of the car and the cattle. However, in the Bamiancheng, Zhengjiatun, and Maolin areas under the Baichengzi Transportation Sub-bureau, regardless of whether the cattle are large or small, or the cars are large or small, the limit is uniformly 16 head.

    In order to load goods to be transported at various stations along the way, a type of "way freight car" is sometimes attached to the train. The number of these cars to be attached depends on the quantity of goods to be transported at various stations along the way. At the same time, these cars must all depart from large stations, and small stations are not allowed to attach way freight cars. However, some dispatching offices and stations deliberately attach more way freight cars in order to make up the number of cars loaded. For example, the freight dispatcher of the Jinzhou Sub-bureau often ordered Jinzhou Station to add more way freight cars. The business office and train freight personnel who were aware of the cargo situation suggested that he stop adding them, but he ignored them. On September 22 last year, the Wenxiang Station of the Luoyang Transportation Sub-bureau added a way freight car, but only loaded 800 kilograms of goods. Sishui added one car and only loaded half a ton of goods. Zhangyu added one car and didn't load even one kilogram of goods.

    Why does this strange phenomenon occur? First of all, the leadership at all levels of the railway must be examined. Originally, the Ministry of Railways assigned the number of cars planned to many railway administrations, many of which were "empty promises" with no goods. Some railway administrations said: "The Ministry of Railways only asks about the number of cars loaded every day and every month, and only asks about the completion of the tonnage at the end of the year. If the number of cars is not completed, it will be difficult to pass the test every day." It is right for the Ministry of Railways to focus on the number of cars, but if it only focuses on the number of cars and does not ask about the quality of the loading, it is easy to cause a tendency for the lower levels to simply pursue the number of cars. For example, the director of the Guangzhou Railway Administration, when deploying the task of increasing production and practicing economy in the fourth quarter of last year, loudly called out that completing the number of cars loaded was completing the transportation task. Under such a call, the following situation occurred: Guangzhou South Station loaded 709 more cars per month in October than the monthly average in the third quarter, but other indicators did not complete the plan. In the first half of November last year, due to the inability of freight cars to be fully loaded, this station loaded a total of 8,262.2 tons of goods less, and the train was delayed 20 times. From the perspective of the entire railway administration, the number of cars loaded in October was 102.2 percent complete, but the tonnage of goods sent was only 97.3 percent complete. The number of cars was more, but the goods were not transported according to the plan.

    The number of cars must be completed, but the tonnage should be completed even more. The state's task for the railway is to transport goods, which is tonnage, which is ton-kilometers. The "car" is just a tool to complete the tonnage of goods transported. Is it not the strangest phenomenon to only transport tools and not transport goods? This intentional and unreasonable use of vehicles, using less loading of goods to make up the number of cars, is an act of wasting national transportation capacity. This is a practice of not seeking reality but only seeking to complete tasks from superficial figures. According to preliminary statistics, due to the scramble to make up the number of cars loaded, the national railway bureaus wasted a total of 2 million tons of national transportation capacity in 1954. If this bad practice of making up the number of cars loaded is not thoroughly corrected, it will cause a huge waste of national transportation capacity.

    铁路运输中的奇怪现象
    丁关根
    铁路运输中现在有一种非常奇怪的现象——许多车站在运货时拼命追求装更多的车，却不管这些车上究竟装了多少货。
    例如，本来大吨位货车应该装比较重的货，如粮食、肥田粉、矿物性建筑材料、煤等；小吨位的棚车应该装比较轻的货，如棉花、烟叶、牲畜等。但是有些铁路的调度所和车站为了凑车数，竟违背了合理使用货车的原则。去年九月底，株州运输分局调度所命令长沙北站用五个五十吨车装猪，每车仅装十六吨。九月二十七日，郑州运输分局许昌车站有四十吨的棚车四辆，车站不用来装可以充分利用货车载重能力的粮食，而去装烟叶，每车只稀松地装了二十吨。去年十月十一日，上海运输分局日晖港车站接到由上海东站送来的八个五十吨空车，那时车站上有肥田粉三百吨，但是，这个车站用了十个三十吨车装走了这三百吨肥田粉，把八个五十吨车如数空跑回去了。这样“灵活”一调配，转手就多完成四个装车数。
    有些车站为了凑装车数，也就不愿意推行先进的装载方法了。北京铁路管理局顺义车站站长不愿意推行双层装猪法，因为一车双层顶两个单层，装一车双层就要少一个装车数。许昌车站站长说：推行双层装猪法，每月就得少一百多个装车数，再推就会使我们的装车任务完不成了。
    铁路规章规定：三十吨的货车可装十头到十六头牛，也可以根据车子和牛的大小不同，适当增加或减少。可是在白城子运输分局所属八面城、郑家屯及茂林一带，却不分大牛、小牛，大车、小车，一律限装十六头。
    为了装载沿途各站待运的货物，列车上有时要挂一种“沿零车”。这种车挂多少，要根据沿途各站待运货物的数量来决定。同时这种车一律要从大站出发，小站是不允许挂沿零车的。但是，有些调度所和车站为了凑车数，竟故意多挂沿零车，如锦州分局货运调度员经常命令锦州站增挂沿零车。掌握货源情况的营业所和列车货运员向他提出停挂的建议，他置之不理。在去年九月二十二日，洛阳运输分局阌乡车站加挂一个沿零车，只装了八百公斤货，泗水加挂了一辆，只装了半吨货，张予加挂了一辆，连一公斤货也没装。
    为什么会产生这种怪现象的呢？这首先得从铁路各级领导上来检查。原来铁道部给许多铁路管理局分配的车数计划，有不少是没有货的“空头”。有些铁路管理局就说：“铁道部每天每月只问装车数，到年底才问吨数完成得怎样。完不成车数，每天过不了关。”铁道部抓车数是对的，但是光抓车数，不问装的质量，就很容易造成下面单纯追求车数的偏向。如广州铁路管理局局长，在布置去年第四季度增产节约任务时，就大声疾呼，说完成装车数就是完成了运输任务。在这样的号召下，结果就出现了这样的情形：广州南站十月份比第三季度每月平均多装七百零九车，但是别的指标都没有完成计划。去年十一月上半月由于货车不能满载，这个车站共少装八千二百六十二点二吨货，列车晚点二十次。从整个铁路管理局来看，十月份的装车数完成了百分之一百零二点二，但是发送货物吨数只完成百分之九十七点三。车数是多了，货物可没按计划运走。
    车数是要完成的，但吨数更应该完成。国家给铁路的任务是运货，是吨数，是吨公里。“车”只是完成运货吨数的工具。只运工具而不运货，难道这不是最奇怪的现象么？这种有意不合理地使用车辆，以少装货物来凑车数，是浪费国家运输力的行为。这是一种不求实际只求从表面数字上完成任务的做法。据初步统计，全国各铁路局由于凑装车数，一九五四年一共浪费了国家二百万吨的运输力。这种凑装车数的恶劣作风如果不彻底纠正，将会造成国家运输力的巨大浪费。
