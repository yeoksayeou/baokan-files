    Some Uses of Training Funds
    To the Editor:
    The Hengyang Mining Machinery Factory runs a technical training class. The superior leading organs—the Nonferrous Metals Industry Administration Bureau and the Central South Branch Bureau—attach great importance to it and allocated a batch of construction funds and training funds.
    The total amount of construction funds was 468 million yuan, of which more than 270 million yuan was spent on the construction of classrooms. But in reality, what was built was not a classroom, but an auditorium; the students of the technical training class only participated in the factory's several meetings and collective activities here, and could not attend classes in it.
    The factory director's office wanted to make fifty leather armchairs, and wanted to take the money from the training funds; the accountant of the technical training class, Que Guoxing, disagreed, and Liu Guozhang, the person in charge of the technical training class at the time, also had objections. Deputy Factory Director Lin Sheng (who has now been transferred to another job) had a half-hour individual talk with Que Guoxing to "get through" to him; he also criticized Liu Guozhang for resisting the leadership, and criticized the technical training class for being antagonistic to the factory's administrative leaders.
    As a result, not only did nearly 10 million yuan of training funds become leather armchairs in the factory director's office; but also the cadres of the technical training class dared not raise any more opinions on how the training funds were used. From then on, any unit in the factory could use the funds of the technical training class.
    Therefore, the factory's sanatorium wanted to build bamboo fences, and used training funds to pay for it; the factory planted flowers and plants, and also used training funds to pay for it; the factory built a large stadium, and still used training funds to pay for it... A leading comrade said: "Anyway, the technical training class has plenty of money, use it!"
    But what about the technical training class? The students' dormitories and classrooms were all bamboo and wattle walls with only a layer of paper pasted on them, and roofs made of two layers of oil-impregnated cotton paper, which were drafty everywhere and had no heating equipment. Some students did not even have books, tools, and practical supplies.　Lu Heng

### 训练费的一些用途

    训练费的一些用途编辑同志：
    衡阳矿山机械厂办了一个技工训练班。上级领导机关——有色金属工业管理局和中南分局都很重视，拨下了一批建筑用费和训练款。
    建筑费用的总数是四亿六千八百万元，有二亿七千多万元开支在建筑课堂的项目中。但实际上，建筑起来的并不是课堂，而是一个礼堂；技术训练班的学员只是在这里参加了厂里的几次会议和集体活动，而不能在里面上课。
    厂长办公室要做五十张皮靠椅，要在训练款里出钱；技术训练班的会计阙国兴不同意，技术训练班当时的负责人刘国障也有意见。副厂长林胜（现已调工作）就和阙国兴作了半个小时的个别谈话，来“打通”他的思想；还批评刘国障反抗领导，批评技术训练班和厂行政领导方面闹对立。
    这样一来，不但近一千万元的训练费变成了厂长办公室里的皮靠椅；而且技术训练班的干部对训练费怎样使用再也不敢提意见了。从此以后，厂里无论那一个单位都可以动用技术训练班的经费。
    于是，厂里疗养院要打竹篱笆，用训练费来开支；厂里种植花草，也用训练费来开支；厂里修大体育场，还是用训练费来开支……。有一位领导同志说：“反正技术训练班有的是钱，用吧！”
    但是技术训练班怎样呢？学员的宿舍和教室都是只糊了一层纸的竹篾墙，两层油棉纸的房顶，到处透风，也没有取暖设备。有些学员还没有书本、工具和实习用品。　陆衡
