The session conveyed the spirit of the First Session of the First National People's Congress and reviewed and approved the Guangdong Provincial People's Government's work report and the Guangdong Provincial People's Court's work report for 1954. The "Guangdong Provincial People's Government Work Report" stated that by the end of 1954, the number of peasant households participating in mutual aid and cooperation organizations in Guangdong Province had increased from 10% of the total number of peasant households in 1953 to over 50%. Grain production increased by 11.46% compared to 1953, completing 46.8% of the Five-Year Plan's production increase target. Among them, rice production increase reached 50.9% of the Five-Year Plan's production increase target. Economic crops such as sugarcane, peanuts, jute, citrus, bananas, pineapples, and silkworms also generally achieved increased production. At the same time, industry, commerce, and transportation also developed. The session determined Guangdong Province's industrial and agricultural production tasks for 1955. This year, the province requires a 10% increase in grain production, a 15.18% increase in sugarcane production, a 41.8% increase in peanut production, and an 87.62% increase in jute production. The session pointed out that the completion of this year's agricultural production tasks mainly depends on the consolidation and development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. Therefore, it is required to successfully manage the 13,000 agricultural production cooperatives that are expected to be developed throughout the province before the spring plowing this year. Under the policy of serving the countryside and agricultural production, local industries should fully utilize the potential of existing industrial equipment. This year, the total industrial output value of the province is required to increase by 16.68% compared to last year. During the discussions, the delegates criticized the shortcomings in the government's work and unanimously expressed that they would better unite the people of the province and strive to successfully complete the tasks for 1955.

The session also unanimously passed the "Resolution Supporting Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's Statement on the US-Chiang 'Mutual Defense Treaty'." (Report from our Guangdong Correspondent Station)
