TASS London, February 2nd: An increasing number of British workers are rising up to protest the American aggression plans against the People's Republic of China. The executive committee of the National Union of Vehicle Builders, with 55,000 members, passed a resolution demanding that the British government not provide any support to American war plans in the Far East. The resolution, which is being distributed to all members of Parliament, emphasizes that union members note with unease "the continued armed interference by the United States in the internal affairs of China."

The Labor Party in the Herford constituency, in its resolution, calls on the party's National Executive Committee to issue a strong statement on the situation in the Far East. The resolution states that "British workers will not support any war by the infamous adventurers currently occupying Taiwan."

The Lancashire branch of the National Union of Railwaymen sent a resolution to Member of Parliament Shawcross. The resolution emphasizes: "No foreign country should interfere" in the internal affairs of the Chinese people.

Xinhua News Agency, February 3rd: United Press correspondent in London, Lawrence Meredith, reported from London on February 2nd, admitting: "Judging from newspapers and public opinion, the vast majority of the British public strongly opposes (British) war over the Taiwan issue, and this sentiment prevails in all parties."

Meredith added: "There is not much sympathy for Chiang Kai-shek in Britain. Chiang Kai-shek is generally considered to have led a corrupt and incompetent government in the past twenty years."

Meredith also said: "The results of a Gallup poll published by the 'News Chronicle' on February 2nd showed that 65 percent of British voters said that if the United States goes to war over the Taiwan issue, Britain should stay out of the war."

    英国人民反对英政府支持美国战争计划
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社伦敦二日讯：越来越多的英国工人起来抗议美国对中华人民共和国的侵略计划。拥有五万五千名会员的全国造车工人联合会的执行委员会通过了一项决议，要求英国政府不要对美国在远东的战争计划给予任何支持。这个正在分发给议会全体议员的决议着重指出，工会会员不安地注意到，“美国继续武装干涉中国内政”。
    赫尔福德选区的工党在它的决议中要求党的全国执行委员会发表一个关于远东局势的有力的声明。这个决议说，“英国工人决不支持目前占据着台湾的声名狼藉的冒险家进行的任何战争”。
    全国铁路工人工会兰开夏分会把一个决议送给了议员肖克劳斯。决议强调说：“任何外国不应该干涉”中国人民的内政。
    【新华社三日讯】合众社驻伦敦记者劳伦斯·麦雷迪斯二月二日从伦敦发出的消息承认：“从报纸和舆论情况看来，英国公众的绝大多数人极力反对（英国）在台湾问题上进行战争，而且在各个党派内也弥漫着这种情绪。”
    麦雷迪斯又说：“英国国内对于蒋介石说来不很同情，一般认为蒋介石在过去二十年中领导了一个腐败无能的政府”。
    麦雷迪斯还说：“‘新闻纪事报’二日发表的盖洛普民意测验的结果表明：百分之六十五的英国选民说，如果美国在台湾问题上进行战争，英国应该站在战争之外”。
