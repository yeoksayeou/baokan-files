In Telemon Village, northern part of the Xikang Province Liangshan Yi Autonomous Region, rows of white canvas tents stand tall. In front of a tent on the west side, groups of Yi people often gather. Many are discussing what to buy to take home, and some come specifically for sightseeing.

The Telemon Trade Group was only recently established, but it has been warmly welcomed by the local Yi people. Yi people from dozens of miles around come here to buy the items they need. Since the trade group started business on November 30th of last year, it has sold 2,500 jin of salt, 1,500 jin of white wine, 800 jin of dried noodles, and a batch of cloth, needles, thread, shoes, and other items to the Yi people in just one and a half months. The Yi people are very grateful for the help from the Communist Party and the People's Government. They say: "We have never had enough salt to eat in our entire lives. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we can not only sleep peacefully (without fighting), but we also have enough salt.”

    帐篷里的贸易组
    在西康省凉山彝族自治区呷洛北部的特勒蒙村，排立着一列列的白顶帆布帐篷。靠西面一座帐篷的前面，常常聚集着一群群的彝胞。不少人在谈论着买什么东西回家，也有人特地来观光。
    特勒蒙贸易组才设立不久，就受到当地彝胞们的热烈欢迎。周围数十里的彝胞都来这里购买他们所需要的物品。贸易小组从去年十一月三十日开始营业以来，一个半月的时间，就卖给彝胞二千五百斤盐巴、一千五百斤白酒、八百斤挂面，和一批布匹、针、线、鞋子等物品。彝胞们都非常感激共产党、人民政府的帮助。他们说：我们过去一辈子没有吃过一顿足够的盐巴。在共产党的领导下，我们不但睡觉安心了（不打冤家），盐巴也足够了。
