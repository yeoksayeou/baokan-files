    Shanghai will build three more artificial rain irrigation stations in its suburban areas this year. Construction of an irrigation station in Xinjiang Township, Zhenru District, began on the 4th with the dredging of water diversion canals.
    China's first artificial rain irrigation station was completed in Dachang District, a suburb of Shanghai, last October. The three new stations to be built this year will have several important improvements, mainly changing the "semi-mobile" equipment to "fully mobile" equipment, with the machines installed on wooden boats for mobile rainmaking, expanding the irrigation range. At the same time, based on the suggestions recently received from the Moscow Institute of Hydraulic Engineering, the sprinkler heads have been improved to make the sprayed rainwater finer and more uniform. After the completion of these three stations, they can irrigate more than 1,400 mu of vegetable fields. (Xinhua News Agency)

    上海将再建三座人工降雨站
    上海市郊区今年将再建三座人工降雨灌溉站。设在真如区新江乡的一座灌溉站，已在四日动工疏浚引水河道。
    我国第一座人工降雨灌溉站去年十月在上海市郊大场区建成。今年新建的三座，将有许多重要改进，主要是将“半流动式”设备改为“全流动式”设备，机器安装在木船上，流动降雨，扩大灌溉范围。同时，根据最近接到的莫斯科水利工程学院来信的建议，改进了喷水龙头，使喷出来的雨水更细更均匀。这三个站建成后，可灌溉一千四百多亩菜田。　（新华社）
