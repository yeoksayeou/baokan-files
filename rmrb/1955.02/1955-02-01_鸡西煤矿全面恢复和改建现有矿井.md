    Jixi Coal Mine is actively carrying out a comprehensive resumption and reconstruction of its existing mines. In the past, the mine blindly pursued "large scale" and neglected to utilize the potential of existing mines, leading to the erroneous closure and abandonment of many mines. Now, after inspection and research by the Ministry of Fuel Industry's working group and Soviet experts, it has been decided to resume and reconstruct thirty-nine mines with restoration and reconstruction value. A restoration and reconstruction committee has been specially organized, and each mine has established a construction section to be specifically in charge of restoration and reconstruction projects. Around October 1954, nineteen mines undergoing restoration and reconstruction had already begun construction. This year, another eight mines undergoing restoration and reconstruction will begin construction, and three mines undergoing restoration and reconstruction will be handed over for production. This year will be a very busy year for restoration and reconstruction, with investments in restoration and reconstruction accounting for 33% of the total mine construction investment. After the active resumption and reconstruction of these closed and abandoned mines and the full utilization of the potential of existing mines, by 1957, the annual output of the mine's existing mines (excluding new construction) will increase by more than 37% compared to the original output, and by 1962, it will increase by as much as three-quarters.

    鸡西煤矿全面恢复和改建现有矿井
    鸡西煤矿现有矿井全面的恢复改建工作正在积极进行。该矿过去由于盲目追求“大规模”，忽视发挥现有矿井的潜力，因此曾错误地停废了许多矿井。现在经过燃料工业部工作组和苏联专家检查研究后，决定将三十九个有恢复改建价值的矿井进行恢复改建工作，并专门组织了一个恢复改建委员会。各矿并设立建设科，专管恢复改建的工程。在一九五四年十月前后，已有十九个恢复改建的矿井开始动工。今年又将有八个恢复改建的矿井动工，并有三个恢复改建的矿井移交生产。今年是恢复改建工作十分紧张的一年，恢复改建的投资要占整个矿井建设投资的百分之三十三。这些停废的矿井进行积极恢复改建和充分发挥现有矿井的潜力后，到一九五七年，就可使该矿现有矿井的年产量（不包括新建）比原来的产量增加百分之三十七以上，到一九六二年增加达四分之三。
