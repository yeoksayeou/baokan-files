Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 3rd - According to a report from the Korean Central News Agency on the 1st, Han Sul-ya, Chairman of the Korean National Committee for the Defense of Peace, recently issued a statement regarding the resolution passed by the Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, saying: This historically significant resolution once again solemnly voices the resounding call of millions upon millions of peace-loving and progressive people.

Han Sul-ya said that war-mongers want to drag Europe, Asia, and the whole world into an atomic war, but the united strength of millions of men and women who signed the Stockholm Appeal thwarted the United States' attempt to use atomic weapons in Korea. There is no doubt that the forces of peace, which have grown several times stronger since then, will crush the blatant aggressive conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists.

Han Sul-ya said that the Soviet Union's peaceful use of atomic energy and its policy of assisting other countries with its experience and technology in the peaceful use of atomic energy have greatly encouraged peace-loving people and are also a warning to the atomic maniacs.

Han Sul-ya concluded by saying that the Korean people support the holding of the World Peace Congress in May and are determined to fight for the implementation of the resolutions of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council.

Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 3rd - According to Polish newspapers, the Presidium of the All-Poland Committee of the National Front and the Presidium of the Polish Committee for the Defense of Peace jointly held an enlarged meeting on January 31st. The meeting discussed the resolutions of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council regarding opposition to the revival of German militarism and the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons, as well as the current international situation and the tasks of the Polish peace movement. The meeting unanimously adopted a resolution. The resolution stated that the Polish people unanimously support the call of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council to destroy the atomic weapons stockpiled by various countries and to stop the production of atomic weapons, and will actively participate in the worldwide people's movement against the threat of atomic war. The struggle against the ratification of the Paris Agreements and against the rearmament of West Germany is continuing to unfold and intensify. German and French patriots will certainly receive the full support and cooperation of all the Polish people and Polish peace defenders in their struggle against the revival of German militarism.

The resolution emphasized: The Polish people are very angrily condemning the aggressive actions of the American aggressors against China's legitimate territory, Taiwan Island. The Polish people express their full support for the just struggle of the Chinese people to liberate their territory, Taiwan.
Xinhua News Agency, 3rd - TASS, Vienna, 2nd - The Austrian Peace Council announced that a signature campaign for the "Appeal to the People of the World" by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, opposing the preparation for atomic war and advocating the destruction of atomic weapons stockpiled by various countries and the immediate cessation of the production of atomic weapons, is being launched in Austria.

In the past few days, two-thirds of the staff of the Siemens Cable Factory in Floridsdorf have already signed the "Appeal to the People of the World" by the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council. The production committee of the Egger Union Motor Factory has decided to support the signature campaign. In this enterprise, almost all employees have signed the "Appeal to the People of the World". Three hundred and fifty signatures have been collected at the locomotive factory.

The signature campaign is also being actively carried out in the Brueckenbach factories, the Traskirchen textile factory, and some other industrial enterprises in Austria.

Xinhua News Agency, 3rd - TASS, Budapest, 1st - The Chemical and Allied Workers' Trade Unions International issued a letter to workers in the relevant industries, calling on them to oppose the use of their labor by imperialists to produce atomic weapons, bacteriological weapons, and chemical weapons in preparation for a new war.
