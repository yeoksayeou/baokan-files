    Do Not Underestimate Wheat Field Management
    Shen Yuqing
    “Autumn harvest relies on hoeing, wheat harvest relies on sowing,” and “Three-tenths of the wheat harvest is secured when the seedlings emerge; no need to worry after sowing” are sayings that have been popular in rural areas for a long time. With the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, this underestimation of wheat field management is gradually changing, but it is still a major obstacle to increasing wheat production.
    Practice over the past few years has proven that every measure in wheat field management is closely related to increasing wheat production. Therefore, we must not neglect this work in any way.
    First, topdressing fertilizer must be applied in a timely manner. Because wheat seedlings weaken after winter, and there are few available nutrients in the soil in early spring, wheat fields urgently need fertilizer. However, in the vast dryland wheat areas of the north, there is a saying that “topdressing is ineffective.” Facts have proven that this statement is unfounded. Last year, farmers in Cangxian County, Hebei Province, applied topdressing fertilizer to 55% of their wheat fields. According to the results of eight comparative demonstration experiments, the average yield increased by 19%. Wheat fields that received both base fertilizer and topdressing fertilizer had even greater yield increases. As for the source of topdressing fertilizer, it is not difficult to solve, because human and animal urine are the best topdressing fertilizers for wheat fields. The results of experiments conducted by Henan Province farms for three years show that applying accumulated urine to wheat can generally increase production by about 20%. Unfortunately, this fertilizer source has not been well utilized in various parts of the north. Henan Province estimates that at least 10 billion catties of urine fertilizer are lost each year, which is equivalent to the fertilizer effect of 200 million catties of ammonium sulfate.
    In the south, where there is more rainfall, draining wheat fields is an important measure to protect seedlings and increase production. In Wuxi County, Jiangsu Province, the wheat field of farmer Liu Amao in Minzhu Township, under the same cultivation methods, had more than 310,000 wheat ears per mu after drainage, while the undrained field had only 133,000 ears, and the plants were short with small ears. Obviously, the yield of the latter must be less than the former. However, various regions rarely pay attention to this work.
    In the north, where rainfall is less, irrigation is an effective way to increase production, but many areas lack the habit of irrigating wheat. According to statistics from five counties in Zhengzhou Prefecture, Henan Province, only 11% of the irrigable area is actually irrigated. In many areas of Shaanxi Province, there is even the erroneous saying that “irrigating in summer yields no grain.” In addition, although some areas irrigate wheat, due to the lack of land preparation or improper irrigation techniques, and without combining it with loosening the soil and applying fertilizer, it results in severe soil cracking or salinization. For example, in the Lao Hui Canal irrigation area of Shaanxi Province, farmer Zhang Zhigong used large-scale flooding irrigation, with a water depth of 1.5 decimeters, resulting in yellowing of the wheat seedlings and a yield reduction of 15 catties per mu compared to the unirrigated fields. The wheat field of Wen Zongrui adopted small-area shallow irrigation, with a water depth of 0.5 decimeters, and timely applied topdressing fertilizer after irrigation, resulting in an increase of 105 catties per mu compared to the unirrigated fields.
    The results of experimental demonstrations over the past two years have proven that in the wheat fields of the north, except for sandy land, harrowing the wheat in early spring also has a definite yield-increasing effect. According to a survey in Shandong Province, spring harrowing can generally increase production by 6% to 8%. However, many regions still hold a conservative attitude towards this advanced Soviet experience and have not vigorously promoted it. In areas where spring harrowing is difficult, the work of hoeing wheat to conserve moisture is also not carried out well. In particular, in the south, where there is more rain and lush grass, hoeing wheat to remove weeds is even more important.
    It must be pointed out that doing a good job in this year's wheat field management is even more necessary. This is because there was more rain last summer and autumn, which affected fertilizer accumulation. After the launch of the excess production campaign last year, most of the fertilizer was used for autumn fields, and the base fertilizer for wheat fields was significantly reduced. For example, in Leling County, Shandong Province, which has 550,000 mu of wheat, more than 200,000 mu were sown on barren land. At the same time, in many areas last year, wheat was planted in a rush during drainage or drought resistance, resulting in untimely sowing, low sowing quality, and poor wheat seedling growth. In addition, from the end of December last year to the beginning of this year, the climate in the Yellow River basin and various southern provinces changed abnormally, and the low temperature and heavy snowfall were rare in recent decades, and many late-sown wheat seedlings suffered frost damage. All of these are new situations that are unfavorable to this year's wheat growth. Therefore, in order to save poorly growing and frost-damaged wheat seedlings, all regions must mobilize farmers to carry out topdressing and mid-tillage weeding in a timely manner. Due to the heavy snow last winter, some wheat fields have accumulated water after the snow melted. For example, in the eighth district of Chengwu County, Shandong Province, more than 500 mu of wheat fields had water depths of half a foot after the snow melted. In Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, more than 100,000 mu of wheat fields were flooded. The accumulated water in these areas of wheat fields must be drained in a timely manner. Southern wheat fields should also do a good job of clearing ditches and draining water, and vigorously weeding to protect seedlings. Although this year's northern wheat fields have good soil moisture due to the heavy snow, complacency is not allowed. In addition to intensifying spring harrowing and hoeing to conserve moisture, we must still be vigilant against spring drought, make timely use of existing water sources, improve irrigation techniques, and expand the area of wheat irrigation. Wheat fields in areas that suffered floods last year also need to do a good job of wheat field management, strive for a bumper summer harvest, and shorten the disaster period.
    The key to doing a good job in wheat field management lies in carrying out in-depth ideological mobilization and strengthening technical guidance. Because the main work of wheat field management is carried out in early spring, when spring planting has generally not yet begun, and the wheat field management work is relatively light and convenient, women and semi-laborers can use it. Therefore, whether from the perspective of time or labor, there are conditions for doing a good job in wheat field management. As long as we are good at relying on mutual aid and cooperative organizations and do a good job of typical demonstrations, we can drive the majority of farmers to carry out this work and strive for increased wheat production this year.

### 不要轻视麦田管理

    不要轻视麦田管理
    沈煜清
    “秋收锄头麦收种”“小麦见苗三分收，种下就不用问”，这是很早以来就在农村中流行着的说法。随着互助合作运动的发展，这种轻视麦田管理的情况虽在逐渐改变，但目前仍是小麦增产的重要障碍。
    几年来的实践证明，麦田管理的每一项措施，对于小麦的增产都有着密切的关系，因此对于这个工作，绝对不应该有所忽视。
    首先，必须及时追肥。因为麦苗经冬，生机衰弱，早春土壤中有效养分少，麦田是迫切需要肥料的。但是，在北方广大的旱地小麦地区却有“追肥无效”的说法。事实证明，这种说法是没有根据的。河北省沧县农民在去年早春在百分之五十五的麦田上施用了追肥，据八个对比示范试验结果，平均增产百分之十九；施用基肥而又施追肥的麦田，增产更多。至于追肥的肥源问题，也是不难解决的，因为人、畜尿就是麦田最好的追肥肥料。河南省农场三年来试验的结果，积尿浇麦一般可增产百分之二十左右。可惜这一肥源北方各地都没有很好地利用。河南省估计每年至少损失尿肥一百多亿斤，相当于二亿斤硫酸铵的肥效。
    在雨水较多的南方，麦田排水是保苗增产的重要措施。江苏省无锡县民主乡农民刘阿毛的麦田，在同样耕作方法下，经过排水的每亩有三十一万多麦穗，没排水的只有十三万三千穗，而且株矮穗小，显然，后者的产量一定要少于前者。但是，各地对于这项工作也很少重视。
    北方雨量较少，灌溉是增产的有效办法，但不少地区缺乏浇麦习惯。据河南省郑州专区五个县的统计，实行浇麦的田只占可浇面积的百分之十一；在陕西省不少地区，更有“浇夏无粮”的错误说法。另外有的地区虽实行浇麦，但由于土地没有整理或浇水技术不当，又不结合松土施肥，结果引起土壤的严重龟裂或硷害。如陕西省劳惠渠灌区农民张治恭用大水漫浇，水深达一点五公寸，结果麦苗发黄，每亩竟较未灌的减产十五斤。文宗瑞的麦田，采用小区浅灌，水深零点五公寸，灌水后又及时施用追肥，每亩就较未灌的田增产一百零五斤。
    二年来试验示范的结果证明，北方的麦田，除沙土地外，实行早春耙麦，也有肯定的增产效果。据山东省调查，春耙一般可增产百分之六到八。但不少地区对这一苏联先进经验还抱着保守的态度，没有大力推广。而在春耙有困难的地区，锄麦保墒工作也开展得不好。特别是南方雨多草茂，锄麦除草更是十分重要。
    必须指出，做好今年的麦田管理，更有其特殊的必要性。这是因为去年夏秋雨多，影响积肥，去年开展超额增产运动后，大部肥料用于秋田，麦田基肥显著减少，如山东乐陵县种麦五十五万亩，有二十余万亩白地下种。同时，去年不少地区，小麦是在排涝或抗旱的情况下抢种的，播种失时，播种质量低，麦苗生长不良。另外，去年十二月底到今年年初，黄河流域及南方各省气候变化不正常，气温之低、降雪之大，为近数十年所少有，不少迟播的麦苗遭受冻害。以上这些都是不利于今年小麦生长的新情况。所以为了挽救生长不良和受冻的麦苗，各地必须发动农民及时进行追肥和中耕除草等工作。由于去冬雪大，雪溶以后，有一些麦田积水，如山东城武县八区有五百多亩麦田雪化以后水深达半尺；河南许昌专区麦田被淹十万亩以上。这些地区麦田的积水，必须及时排除。南方麦田，更要作好清沟排水工作，并大力除草保苗。今年北方麦田虽因雪多墒好，但也不容麻痹自满，除要加紧春耙锄麦保墒外，仍要警惕春旱，及时利用现有水源，改进灌溉技术，扩大浇麦面积。南方春季干旱的麦田，也要提倡适当灌溉。在去年遭受水灾地区，尤其需要作好麦田管理，争取夏作多收，缩短灾荒。
    作好麦田管理的关键，在于深入地进行思想发动和加强技术指导。因为麦田管理的主要工作都在早春进行，这时春种一般还没有开始，而且麦田管理工作比较轻便，妇女和半劳动力都可利用。所以不论从时间或劳力上看，做好麦田管理都是有条件的。只要善于依靠互助合作组织，作好典型示范，就可以带动广大农民来开展这一工作，争取今年小麦增产。
