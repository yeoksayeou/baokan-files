Xinhua News Agency, February 26th dispatch from Bangkok: The Manila Treaty Organization conference held in Bangkok concluded on the 25th.

The conference's communiqué reveals that the United States and its followers have decided to further promote Washington's aggressive policies, interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries, suppress the independence struggles of Asian peoples, prepare for new wars of aggression, disrupt peace in Asia, and intensify tensions in Asia.

It is known that Asian public opinion has expressed justified anger at the Bangkok conference's nefarious schemes. Although the participants of the Bangkok conference used many empty words in the communiqué, such as "strengthening peace," "non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries," and "upholding the principle of self-determination," they still could not conceal their aggressive aims. The communiqué expressed the participants' "extreme concern" about so-called "subversive activities" in Southeast Asia and emphasized that "member governments must cooperate" to "stamp out" these so-called "subversive activities." It is known that the term "subversive activities" is what the likes of Dulles and Eden call the independence struggles of the peoples of Southeast Asia. These colonialists are deliberately trying to stifle the national rights of the people in these regions. The communiqué stated that "one of the primary tasks" of the Manila Treaty Organization Council representatives is to arrange a conference attended by "specially qualified personnel" to study ways to deal with so-called "subversive activities." Sources revealed that Dulles has indicated to the conference that the United States will send intelligence personnel to Southeast Asia to participate in and guide this activity.

The conference's communiqué further proves that the so-called "Southeast Asia Defense Organization" is entirely an aggressive military bloc that is preparing for new wars of aggression. The conference decided to form a military advisory body composed of military representatives from eight countries. The staff planners of these military advisors will hold a meeting in Manila in April to formulate "military plans" for implementing the Manila Treaty. Sources say that the United States will use this agency to achieve its goal of tying member states to the American chariot. It is reported that the chairman of this military advisory body has been internally designated to be a British general. Many sources reveal that this is a reward from the United States at the Bangkok conference to Britain, its enthusiastic follower.

The Manila Conference openly violated the Geneva Conference agreements by including Indochina within the scope of the treaty. During the Bangkok conference, the United States and its followers vigorously advocated intensifying interference in Indochina and further undermining the Geneva Accords. Although the conference's communiqué did not fully disclose the United States' sinister intentions, it reiterated the member governments' "determination to support" Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam, and stated that it hoped that member governments would provide further "assistance," that is, further interference. Sources say that Dulles plans to go to South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia after the Bangkok conference to further arrange for the destruction of the Geneva Accords.

In order to win over more Asian countries to join the Manila Treaty Organization, the conference's communiqué discussed the issue of so-called economic "aid." According to Reuters, the participants emphasized at the meeting that this "aid" should only be used in "areas where it can play a political and military role." Several sources also revealed that the reason why the conference did not make a clearer decision on this was because the United States preferred to exclusively control the economies of the aid-receiving countries through so-called "bilateral agreements," rather than have its poor partners share a piece of the pie.

The conference's communiqué also decided to establish an eight-nation council and have the eight countries appoint representatives to establish a permanent body in Bangkok to "maintain constant consultation." A secretariat will also be established for this purpose.

The Bangkok conference also passed a resolution on the Asian-African Conference. This resolution tried to conceal their hostility towards the Asian-African Conference in order to ease the dissatisfaction of Asian countries. It is worth pointing out that the resolution emphasized that the three Asian countries of the Manila Treaty Organization will participate in the Asian-African Conference. American news agencies had already revealed that in order to avoid strong condemnation from the Asian people, the United States will not take an openly opposed attitude towards the Asian-African Conference, but will adopt a more covert strategy, that is, to sabotage the Asian-African Conference from within through certain American puppet states participating in the Asian-African Conference.

The public opinion of many Asian countries pointed out that the convening of the Bangkok conference was to prevent the Asian-African Conference from achieving true success. They believe that the countries and peoples participating in the Asian-African Conference have a responsibility to jointly defeat the conspiracies of the United States and its followers.

    准备新的侵略战争的曼谷会议已经结束
    会议公报表明美国及其仆从准备加甚亚洲的紧张局势
    【新华社二十六日讯】曼谷消息：在曼谷举行的马尼拉条约国家会议已经在二十五日闭幕。
    会议的公报表明，美国和它的追随者们决定进一步推行华盛顿制订的侵略政策，干涉亚洲各国内政，镇压亚洲各国人民的独立斗争，准备新的侵略战争，破坏亚洲的和平，加甚亚洲的紧张局势。
    人们知道，亚洲的舆论对曼谷会议的罪恶勾当表示了正当的愤怒。曼谷会议的参与者们虽然在公报中用了许多什么“加强和平”、“不干涉其他国家内政”、“维护自决权的原则”等空洞的言词来粉饰，但依然没有能够掩盖他们追求的侵略性的目的。公报表示与会者们“极为关切”在东南亚地区的所谓“颠覆活动”，并且强调“各成员国政府必须进行合作”来“扑灭”这些所谓“颠覆活动”。人们知道，所谓“颠覆活动”是杜勒斯、艾登之流对东南亚各国人民独立斗争的称呼，这些殖民主义者们处心积虑要扼杀这些地区人民的民族权利。公报声言，马尼拉条约集团理事会代表的“首要任务之一”就是要安排由“特别有资格人员”参加的会议，以研究对付所谓“颠覆活动”的办法。消息透露，杜勒斯已向会议表示，美国将派遣特务人员到东南亚地区来参加和指导这一活动。
    会议的公报进一步证明了所谓“东南亚防务集团”完全是侵略性的军事集团，这个集团正在准备新的侵略战争。会议决定由八国军事代表组成军事顾问机构。这些军事顾问们的参谋策划人员将于四月间在马尼拉举行会议，来拟订执行马尼拉条约的“军事方面的计划”。从透露出来的消息说，美国将利用这个机构来达到它所追求的把各成员国缚在美国战车上的目的。消息说，这个军事顾问机构的主席已内定由英国将领担任。许多消息透露，这是美国在曼谷会议上对英国这个热心的追随者的一点报酬。
    马尼拉会议曾公然违反日内瓦会议协议，把印度支那包括在条约范围之内。这次曼谷会议过程中，美国和它的追随者们曾极力主张加紧干涉印度支那，进一步破坏日内瓦协议。会议的公报虽然没有完全披露美国方面的罪恶意图，但它重申成员国政府“决心支持”柬埔寨、老挝和南越，并且说希望成员国政府将提供进一步的“援助”，也就是说进一步的干涉。消息说，杜勒斯准备在曼谷会议以后到南越、老挝、柬埔寨去，进一步布置对日内瓦协议的破坏。
    为了拉拢更多的亚洲国家参加马尼拉条约的组织，会议的公报谈到了所谓经济“援助”问题。据路透社报道，与会者们在会上强调指出这种“援助”只应该用到“它能够在政治和军事方面起作用的地区去”。若干消息还透露，会议之所以没有对此作出较明确的决定，是因为美国宁愿经过所谓“双边协定”去独占地控制接受援助的国家的经济，而不愿它的穷伙友分享一杯羹。
    会议的公报还决定成立八国理事会，并由八国任命代表在曼谷成立常设机构，以“保持不断的磋商”。为此还设立一个秘书处。
    曼谷会议还通过了一项关于亚非会议的决议。这个决议为了缓和亚洲各国的不满，亟力隐藏他们对亚非会议的敌视。值得指出的是，决议中强调了马尼拉条约集团的三个亚洲国家将参加亚非会议。美国的通讯社早就透露，美国为了避免亚洲人民的强烈谴责，将不采取公开反对亚非会议的态度，而采取较隐蔽的策略，即通过某些参加亚非会议的美国仆从国家来从内部破坏亚非会议。
    许多亚洲国家的舆论指出，曼谷会议的召开就是为了阻挠亚非会议获得真正成就。它们认为参加亚非会议的国家和人民有责任共同击败美国和它的追随者们的阴谋。
