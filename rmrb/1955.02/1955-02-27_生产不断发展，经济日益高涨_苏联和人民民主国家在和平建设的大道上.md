    Production Continues to Develop, Economy Increasingly Booming
    ——The Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries on the Road of Peaceful Construction
    Soviet Steel Production Achieves Great Success
    In 1954, the Soviet steel industry's steel production increased by 8% compared to 1953 (38 million tons), and pig iron production increased by 9% compared to 1953 (over 27 million tons). Last year, the average steel production per square meter of open-hearth furnace bottom area in the Soviet Union increased by 3% compared to 1953, and the utilization coefficient of blast furnace effective volume improved by 4% compared to 1953. The scale of rapid steelmaking in the Soviet Union is unprecedented. Currently, there is hardly an open-hearth furnace workshop without rapid steelmaking workers. In the past, it generally took about 12 hours to refine a furnace of steel in an ordinary open-hearth furnace. After the promotion of the rapid steelmaking method, it was reduced to 6 to 7 hours, and it is still being continuously improved.
    In 1954, Soviet steelmaking technology continued to improve, and many advanced enterprises emerged. Metallurgical workers at the Lenin Factory in Dnepropetrovsk Oblast, Ukraine, increased steel production per square meter of furnace bottom area by almost half a ton due to mastering new steelmaking techniques.
    In ironmaking, the Soviet Union adopted the world's most advanced ironmaking technology. Mechanization and automation in operation were further improved last year. Advanced working methods such as rapid material flow, steam blowing, oxygen-enriched blowing, and high-pressure operation adopted by ironmaking enterprises greatly increased iron production. For example, the assembly work, furnace material transportation work, preparation and supply of refractory materials, and switching of tapholes in the blast furnace workshop of the Ural Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Plant are now carried out by machines. The temperature is kept in a normal state.
  Spring Field Work Begins in Southern Regions of the Soviet Union
    The climate in the southern regions of the Soviet Union is very warm this spring, and the spring field work of collective farms and state farms has already begun.
    In many areas of the Tajik Republic, the daytime temperature is now above 20 degrees Celsius. By February 7th, collective farms in various regions had sown more than 40,000 hectares (1 hectare equals 15 mu) of barley and wheat, which is four times the amount in the same period last year. Four districts completed spring sowing almost a month earlier than last year. The sowing of corn has begun in the southern regions, and the total corn sowing area in the entire republic this year will increase by about three times compared to last year.
    Sowing work has been universally launched in the Uzbek and Turkmen Republics. The spring sowing work in Surkhandarya Oblast, Uzbekistan, is about to end; collective farms in many districts are preparing to sow melons, watermelons, and feed crops. At present, irrigation work is still being carried out in cotton fields before sowing in order to increase yields.
    In the Russian Federation, many collective farms in the Don River basin are applying fertilizer to winter crops. Agricultural airplanes are working in the fields of collective farms. Spring plowing and spring sowing have already begun in many regions. Agricultural machinery from machine tractor stations in twenty districts of the Stavropol Territory is harrowing autumn fields and winter crops for collective farms. The sowing of spring wheat and barley has been completed in the Dzerzhinsky Collective Farm in the Aleksandrovsky District of the Rostov Oblast.
  Polish Electricity Production Catches Up with Many European Countries
    In 1954, Poland's total power generation reached 15.5 billion kilowatt-hours, ranking seventh in Europe. Calculated on a per capita basis, Poland's electricity production has caught up with countries such as Italy, the Netherlands, and Denmark, and has reached the level of France before World War II.
    Before World War II, Poland was one of the most backward countries in Europe in terms of electricity production, with an average annual electricity consumption per person only equal to one-third of that of Denmark. However, in the ten years after liberation, the growth rate of Poland's power generation has averaged 13% per year, which is equivalent to three times the development speed of Poland's power industry before the war. Due to the rapid growth of power generation, the electricity used in industrial production has also greatly increased. In 1938, the electricity used in Polish industry was only 2.2 billion kilowatt-hours, and in 1955, industrial electricity consumption will increase to 12 billion kilowatt-hours.
    The technology of Poland's power industry before the war was also very backward, and it took one kilogram of high-quality coal to generate one kilowatt-hour of electricity. Now, Poland only needs a little more than half a kilogram of low-quality coal to generate the same amount of electricity.
    Czechoslovakia Expands Foreign Trade
    The Czechoslovak Republic has recently signed new trade agreements with countries such as Burma, West Germany, France, Austria, Norway, Finland, and Argentina.
    According to the long-term trade and payment agreement signed with Burma on February 14, Czechoslovakia will supply Burma with various machines, equipment, and light industrial products in 1955. Burma will supply Czechoslovakia with rice, feed, rubber, tungsten ore, high-quality lead ore, and other products.
    In 1955, the volume of trade between Czechoslovakia and West Germany will increase by 20% compared to 1953.
    The long-term trade agreement signed between Czechoslovakia and Argentina stipulates that the total value of trade between the two countries this year will increase to 64 million US dollars.
    Mongolia Further Strengthens State-Owned Farms and Ranches
    The Mongolian "Truth Daily" published a resolution by the Mongolian Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party on further strengthening state-owned farms and ranches organizationally and economically.
    The resolution pointed out that, thanks to the care of the Party and the government and the help of the Soviet Union, state-owned farms and ranches have become large-scale socialist enterprises equipped with advanced technology. In the past seven years, the total number of cattle in state-owned farms and ranches has increased by 3.2 times; sheep have increased by 2.7 times; and the sown area has increased by 178%. State-owned farms and ranches are using advanced animal husbandry and agricultural techniques. In the past seven years, the total number of tractors in state-owned farms and ranches has increased by more than 2.5 times.

    生产不断发展，经济日益高涨
    ——苏联和人民民主国家在和平建设的大道上
    苏联钢铁生产获得巨大成绩
    一九五四年，苏联钢铁工业的钢产量比一九五三年（三千八百万吨）增加了百分之八，生铁产量比一九五三年（二千七百多万吨）增加了百分之九。去年苏联每一平方公尺平炉炉底面积的平均产钢量，比一九五三年增加了百分之三，高炉有效容积利用系数比一九五三年改进了百分之四。在快速炼钢方面，苏联的规模是空前的。目前几乎没有一个平炉车间没有快速炼钢工人。过去一般平炉炼一炉钢需要十二小时左右，推广快速炼钢法以后，降低到六至七小时，而且还在不断地改进着。
    一九五四年，苏联炼钢技术不断改进，涌现了许多先进的企业单位。乌克兰第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克州列宁工厂的冶金工人，由于掌握了新的炼钢技术，使每平方公尺炉底面积的钢产量几乎增加半吨。
    在炼铁方面，苏联采用了世界上最先进的炼铁技术。操作中的机械化和自动化在去年又有了进一步的提高，炼铁企业采用的快料顺行、蒸气鼓风、富氧鼓风、高压操作等先进的工作方法，使炼铁量大大增加了。例如乌拉尔马格尼托哥尔斯克钢铁厂的高炉车间的装配工作、运炉料的工作、准备和供应耐火材料的工作和开关出铁口的工作，现在都用机器来进行。温度保持正常的状态。
  苏联南部地区开始春季田间工作
    苏联南部地区今年春季气候非常暖和，集体农庄和国营农场的春季田间工作已经开始了。
    塔吉克共和国许多地区白天的温度现在在摄氏二十度以上。各地集体农庄到二月七日已经播种了四万多公顷（每公顷合十五市亩）大麦和小麦，等于去年同时期的四倍。有四个区差不多比去年提前一个月完成了春播工作。南部地区已经开始播种玉蜀黍，全共和国今年玉蜀黍播种面积约将比去年增加三倍。
    乌兹别克和土库曼共和国已经普遍展开播种工作。乌兹别克苏尔汉—达里亚州的春播工作就要结束了；许多区的集体农庄正在准备播种香瓜、西瓜和饲料作物。目前，各地还在进行棉田播种前的浇灌工作，以便提高收获量。
    在俄罗斯联邦，顿河流域的许多集体农庄正在为冬季作物追施肥料。农业用的飞机正在集体农庄的田野上工作。春耕和春播工作已经在许多地区开始。斯塔夫罗波尔边疆区有二十个区的机器拖拉机站的农业机器，正在为集体农庄耙秋田和冬季作物。罗斯托夫州亚历山大区捷尔任斯基集体农庄的春小麦和大麦的播种工作已经完毕。
  波兰电力生产赶上许多欧洲国家
    一九五四年，波兰的总发电量达到了一百五十五亿瓩时，而跃居欧洲第七位。如按人口平均计算，波兰的电力生产量已经赶上了意大利、荷兰、丹麦等国家，并且已经达到了第二次世界大战以前法国的水平。
    在第二次世界大战以前，波兰在电力生产方面是欧洲最落后的国家之一，每人每年平均用电量只等于丹麦的三分之一。但在解放后的十年中，波兰发电量每年增长的速度平均是百分之十三，相当于战前波兰电力工业发展速度的三倍。由于发电量的迅速增长，工业生产中所使用的电力也大大增加了。一九三八年，波兰工业中所使用的电力只不过二十二亿瓩时，一九五五年工业用电将增加到一百二十亿瓩时。
    战前波兰电力工业的技术也十分落后，每发一瓩时的电力就要消耗一公斤上等煤。现在，波兰只需要半公斤多劣质煤就可以发同样多的电力。
    捷克斯洛伐克扩大对外贸易
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国最近曾同缅甸、西德、法国、奥地利、挪威、芬兰和阿根廷等国签订了新的贸易协定。
    根据二月十四日签订的捷缅长期贸易和支付协定，一九五五年捷克斯洛伐克将供给缅甸各种机器、设备和轻工业产品等。缅甸将供给捷克斯洛伐克大米、饲料、橡胶、钨矿、精选铅矿和其他产品。
    一九五五年，捷克斯洛伐克和西德间的换货量将比一九五三年增加百分之二十。
    捷克斯洛伐克和阿根廷间签订的长期贸易协定规定，今年两国的换货总值将增加到六千四百万美元。
    蒙古进一步加强国营农牧场
    蒙古“真理报”刊载蒙古部长会议和蒙古人民革命党中央委员会关于进一步在组织上和经济上加强国营农牧场的决议。
    决议指出，由于党和政府的关怀和苏联的帮助，国营农牧场已成为用先进技术装备起来的大型的社会主义企业。在最近七年里，国营农牧场的牛的总头数增加了三点二倍；羊增加了二点七倍；播种面积增加了百分之一百七十八。国营农牧场正在运用先进的动物饲养术和农业技术。在最近七年里，国营农牧场的拖拉机总数增加了二点五倍多。
