    The aquatic product company of Lüda City is actively planning preparations for setting sail for whaling in order to develop China's whaling industry. This is the first time China has officially used ships and cannons to go whaling. In the Lüda Aquatic Products Shipyard, the whaling ship is being overhauled in the dry dock. The workers are actively manufacturing and procuring whaling tools for the ship, and the workers of the Lüda Hardware General Factory are trial-producing new products—whaling guns—to support the crew members who are about to set sail. Some fishermen living on coastal islands, hearing that the government was going to organize whaling work, automatically collected whaling tools left on the islands by the Japanese during the puppet Manchukuo period, such as harpoon arrows, gun barrels, and whale knives, and handed them over to the aquatic product company.

    第一艘捕鲸船准备出海
    旅大市水产公司为开展我国的捕鲸事业正积极筹划出海捕鲸的准备工作，这是我国第一次正式使用船、炮出海捕鲸。在旅大水产修造船厂里，捕鲸船正在船坞中进行检修，职工们积极为该船制配和采购捕鲸工具，旅大市五金总厂的工人正试制着新产品——捕鲸炮，支援即将出海的船员们。一些居住在沿海岛屿上的渔民们，听说政府要组织捕鲸工作，他们就自动将伪满时日本人掷留在岛屿上的捕鲸工具如：炮箭、炮筒、割鲸刀等收集起来送交水产公司。　（本报辽宁记者站）
