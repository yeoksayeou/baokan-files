    The Story of the Kawa Youth Ai Ga
    Zhao Zhongxin
        On August 1, 1953, the People's Government established a training class for ethnic minority cadres in Ximeng Mountain, the central area of the Kawa Mountain region on the Yunnan border. Yan Kuo, the Kawa headman of Daluo Village, voluntarily became a student in the first class. Yan Kuo was already a 60-year-old man, but during his studies, he never missed a single class. He said, "Listening to Chairman Mao's teachings is sweeter than eating honey!" He had lived in this remote Kawa Mountain for sixty years, and the people he had seen coming to Kawa Mountain either robbed or tortured the Kawa people. No one sympathized with the Kawa people's suffering, and no one respected the Kawa people like the People's Liberation Army sent by Chairman Mao. After twenty days of short-term study, Yan Kuo understood many principles he had never heard before. He happily told everyone he met, "With Chairman Mao's teachings, the Kawa people are saved!" When the second training class was recruiting students, he personally brought his son Ai Ga to register. He also found the training class instructor, Comrade Qun, and entrusted him, saying, "Comrade Qun, I entrust my son to you. Teach him more of Chairman Mao's teachings."
    Following in his father's footsteps, Ai Ga became a student in the second training class. Like his father, Ai Ga was very attentive during his studies. In discussion meetings, he would become emotional and tearful when he talked about how the Kuomintang bandit gangs had taken away his family's cattle, seized the rice they were about to cook, stripped the pants off his father, and raided villages to conscript men… Every night when he went to sleep, the instructor's words from the daytime would echo in his ears, and he would be so excited that he couldn't fall asleep. "All ethnic groups are equal. The Kawa people are the masters of their own nation. They must learn the skills to be masters of their own affairs and build Kawa Mountain into a prosperous place like the interior of the motherland." Who would have ever taught us Kawa people these principles in the past! The instructor is a Han Chinese, but he treats the Kawa and Lahu students as affectionately as a father and mother. He teaches us during the day and works until midnight at night. Before going to bed, he is still afraid that we are cold, so he adds wood to the fire pit, checks if we are cold, and tucks us in. But why is our study period only twenty days? If my father agrees, how great would it be if I could stay with the instructor forever! Thinking of this, he was both excited and worried, and in the end, he couldn't come up with a good solution.
    Twenty days passed in the blink of an eye. In this short period, Ai Ga understood many new principles he had never heard before. Studying opened his eyes, stimulated his national self-esteem, and strengthened his determination to build the remote and backward Kawa Mountain into a prosperous and happy mountain area. On the night of the graduation ceremony, he lay in bed, recalling the oppression and humiliation the Kawa people had suffered in the past. He thought that the reactionary ruling class had never regarded the Kawa people as human beings. They called Kawa Mountain "Savage Mountain" and constantly sent troops to suppress the Kawa people and sent "reclamation groups" to "assimilate" the Kawa people. He didn’t know how many Kawa people were killed by them, or died of illness or starvation in impoverished lives. After liberation, the Kawa people finally turned themselves around and began to embark on a bright and happy road. "It is precisely because of this that I have the opportunity to study. Now I am graduating and will be going back tomorrow. The instructor said that once conditions are ripe in Kawa Mountain, an autonomous region will be established. How can the principles I learned in these twenty days be used! If I don't study well, I won't be able to do good things for my ethnic group! No, I want to stay, I want to continue studying, I want to talk to the instructor, and ask him to persuade my father to agree." Thinking of this, he immediately got up to find the instructor; however, suddenly a concern stopped him in his tracks, he thought of his fiancée, An Daowa, who knows if she will agree to what I am doing! If she agrees, that's good, but if she doesn't… Ai Ga sat on the bed, his heart filled with contradictions and struggles. For a moment, he didn't know how to decide this major life event. He loved An Daowa, and he and she had suffered together since childhood, chopping firewood and digging wild vegetables together in the mountains. He had a lifelong oath of unwavering love with her. If she disagreed, it would be such a heartbreaking thing for Ai Ga! But this Kawa youth, who had turned himself around, finally made a clear and affirmative choice.
    Ai Ga mustered his courage to find the instructor and stated his reasons and determination to stay in the team to continue studying. The instructor happily agreed to consider his request and inquired in detail about his family and whether he had a lover. Ai Ga told him about his thoughts just now. The instructor said kindly to him: "I will be responsible for persuading your father. Regarding whether your lover can agree, you still need to consider it carefully and try to persuade her to get her consent." Ai Ga replied: "Instructor, what you said is exactly what I thought. I will definitely explain it to her carefully, but I also think this way, without a wife, Kawa Mountain won't rot; without learning Chairman Mao's teachings, the Kawa people will never be able to turn themselves around." These profound and moving words greatly moved the instructor. From this Kawa youth, he further recognized the importance of correctly implementing the Party's ethnic policy, and saw the excellent qualities of the Kawa people and the bright future and hope of Kawa Mountain.
    The next morning, most of the students were happily sent back to their villages. Only the students from the villages near Ximeng Mountain were reluctant to leave the training class. Ai Ga's father, Yan Kuo, calculated that his son should be back that day, but he did not return even by noon, so he rode his horse to the ethnic minority cadre training class in Ximeng Mountain. Ai Ga led his father to the instructor's office. The instructor prepared food and wine to warmly entertain Yan Kuo, and asked for his opinion on Ai Ga's willingness to stay and study. As expected, the old man generously agreed.
    The next day, Ai Ga returned home with his father. He didn't even enter the house before he went to find An Daowa. When An Daowa saw that her fiancé, Ai Ga, had changed his clothes, his dark, lively eyes made An Daowa immediately recognize that this was none other than Ai Ga, the older brother she had been missing every day for twenty days. She hurriedly blew on the fire in the fire pit to make tea for Ai Ga, and brought out the bunch of bananas she had saved for a long time for her older brother to eat. Ai Ga peeled a banana the size of a goat's horn and gave it to An Daowa, and An Daowa also carefully peeled a large banana and handed it to Ai Ga.
    While eating the sweet bananas, Ai Ga asked An Daowa about her recent life, and then he told An Daowa what was hidden in his heart. An Daowa expressed her complete agreement with his aspirations, and only put forward one condition: never forget her.
    Ai Ga spent two days of happy life at home. He went back to Ximeng Mountain.
    Instructor Qun, according to the instructions of the Ximeng Working Committee, decided to let Ai Ga work and study at the same time. From then on, Ai Ga became a formal staff member and student of the ethnic training class. Ai Ga achieved his wish, and his work and study were very active. Many Kawa students envied and longed for the path Ai Ga had taken. Ai Ga's father also felt honored to have such a son, and his clansmen also said that this was the glory of the Kawa people.
    Ai Ga worked and studied in the training class with peace of mind and pleasure. Before he knew it, another month had passed. One night, instructor Qun called him in, asked him if he had any difficulties, and suggested that he go home to see his parents. Ai Ga said he was busy with work and didn't want to go back. The instructor said: "In the past, your Kawa custom was not to spend the night outside. It's been a month, your parents must be missing you, and also..." Although the instructor didn't say it, the smart Ai Ga already knew who he was talking about, and he couldn't help but blush.
    This time when Ai Ga returned home, his backpack was bulging, and inside, in addition to the five pounds of salt he bought for his family, there was also a piece of brightly colored floral cloth.
    An Daowa received the floral cloth and said, "Brother, I see your heart."
    His father said: "Child, you must listen carefully to Chairman Mao's words."
    After Ai Ga worked in the training class for a period of time, he suddenly heard a piece of news that made him extremely excited - the Yunnan Nationalities Institute in Kunming was recruiting students. Just as he was about to ask the instructor for permission, the instructor had already considered this matter, and had already filled in Ai Ga's name on the list of five Kawa and Lahu students to be sent to Kunming to study.

    佧瓦族青年爱戛的故事
    赵忠信
        一九五三年八月一日，人民政府在云南边疆佧瓦山中心地区的西盟山设立了民族干部训练班，达洛寨佧瓦族头人岩阔自愿做了第一期学员。岩阔已经是六十岁老人了，可是在学习期间，一堂课也没肯缺，他说：“听了毛主席的道理，真比吃了蜂蜜还甜哩！”他在这荒僻的佧瓦山生活了六十年，以前所见到来佧瓦山的人，不是抢佧瓦，就是拷佧瓦，没有一个人同情佧瓦的苦楚，没有一个人像毛主席派来的解放军这样尊重佧瓦族人。岩阔经过二十天的短期学习，懂得了许多从来未听过的道理，他高兴的逢人就说：“有了毛主席的道理，佧瓦族得救啦！”第二期训练班招生的时候，他亲自带着他的儿子爱戛来报了名。并且还找到训练班指导员?群同志托付说：“?同志，我把儿子交给你了，毛主席的道理要多多教他。”
    爱戛继父亲之后，做了训练班的第二期学员。爱戛在学习当中，跟他父亲一样，非常用心。在讨论会上，他一讲起国民党匪帮拉走他家的牛，抢去他们下锅的米，剥掉父亲身上的裤子，持枪下寨抓丁……就激动得掉泪。他每天晚上睡觉的时候，指导员在白天讲的话总在耳边响着，兴奋得不能入睡。“各民族一律平等，佧瓦族人民是自己民族的主人，要学会当家作主的本领，要把佧瓦山建设成像祖国内地一样繁荣。”过去有谁肯教我们佧瓦人知道这些道理呀！指导员是个汉族人，可是他对待佧瓦族和拉祜族的同学真像阿爹阿妈一样亲，他白天给我们上课，晚上工作半夜，睡觉前还怕我们冷，给我们填填火塘里火，摸摸我们冷不冷，给我们盖好被。可是我们学习期间为什么只二十天呢？要是阿爹同意，让我永远跟指导员在一起该多好啊！想到这里，他既兴奋又耽心，最后还是没想出好办法来。
    二十天的时光，一转眼就过去了。爱戛在这短短的时间里，懂得了许多从来没有听说过的新道理。学习打开了他的眼界，启发了他的民族自尊心，坚定了他要把荒僻落后的佧瓦山建设成繁荣幸福的山区的决心。在举行了毕业典礼的那天晚上，他躺在床上，回忆着过去佧瓦族遭受的压迫和侮辱。他想，反动统治阶级从来没把佧瓦族人民当人看过，他们把佧瓦山叫作“野人山”，还不断派兵来剿灭佧瓦族，派“垦殖团”来“同化”佧瓦族，也不知道有多少佧瓦族人被他们杀害了，或是在穷困的生活中病死、饿死了。解放以后，佧瓦族才翻了身，开始走上光明幸福的道路。“也正因为这样，我才能有学习的机会。现在我毕业了，明天就要回去了，指导员说佧瓦山一旦条件成熟时，就要建立自治区，这二十天学习的道理怎么能够用呢！学不好就不能给本民族办好事啊！不成，我要留下，我要继续学习，我要找指导员去说，并且叫他动员父亲答应我。”想到这里，他立刻爬起来想去找指导员；可是，忽然一件心事拦住了他的脚步，他想起了他的未婚妻安道娃，谁知道我这样做她是不是同意呢！她要同意还好，要是不同意……爱戛坐在床上，心里充满了矛盾和斗争。他一时不知道怎样来决定这件关系终身的大事情。他爱安道娃，他和她从小在一块受苦，一块在山里砍柴，挖野菜，他跟她有终生不变心的誓约。万一她不同意，对爱戛说是件多么伤心的事啊！但是，这位翻了身的佧瓦族青年，终于作了明确肯定的选择。
    爱戛鼓着勇气去找指导员，并申述了他愿意留队继续学习的理由和决心。指导员满怀着欣喜的心情答应可以考虑他的请求，同时详细询问了他的家庭和有无爱人等情况。爱戛就把他刚才的想法向指导员说了一遍。指导员亲切地对他说：“你父亲由我负责向他动员，关于你爱人能不能同意，你还要作认真考虑，要尽量说服她，征得她的同意才好。”爱戛回答说：“指导员，你说的正是我想的，我一定向她好好解释，不过我还这样想，婆娘不要，佧瓦山烂不了；不学毛主席的道理，佧瓦族永也翻不了身。”这深刻动人的话，使指导员受到很大感动。他从这位佧瓦族青年身上，进一步认识了正确地贯彻党的民族政策的重要性，看到了佧瓦族人民的优良品质和佧瓦山美好的未来和希望。
    第二天清晨，大部分学员被欢送回寨了，只有离西盟山近的几个寨子的学员，还恋恋不舍地不愿离开训练班。爱戛的父亲岩阔计算着这天儿子该回来了，可是等到中午，仍不见回来，于是就骑上马，赶到了西盟山民族干部训练班里。爱戛把父亲领到指导员的办公室。指导员备饭打酒热情地招待了岩阔，并把爱戛愿意留下学习的问题征求他的意见。跟预料到的一样，老人慷慨地答应了。
    第二天爱戛跟父亲回到家里。他连家门没进，就去找安道娃。安道娃见自己的未婚夫爱戛虽然换了服装，但他那双乌黑欢跳的眼睛使安道娃一下就认出这不是别人，正是离开她二十天使她天天怀念的爱戛阿哥。她慌忙吹旺火塘里的火，给爱戛烧茶，并把留了好久的那串芭蕉拿来给阿哥吃。爱戛把一个羊角般大的芭蕉剥了皮送给安道娃，安道娃也把细心剥去皮的一个大芭蕉递给爱戛。
    爱戛一面吃着香甜的芭蕉，一面询问着安道娃近来的生活情形，然后才把藏在心里的话掏给了安道娃。安道娃表示完全同意他的志向，只提出了一个条件：千万不要忘了她。
    爱戛在家里度过两天愉快生活。就回西盟山了。
    ?群指导员根据西盟工委的指示，确定让爱戛一面工作一面学习，从此，爱戛就成了民族训练班的正式工作人员兼学员了。爱戛达到了自己的愿望，工作和学习非常积极。许多佧瓦族学员都羡慕和向往爱戛所走的路。爱戛的父亲也以自己有这样的儿子感到荣耀，他的同族人也说这是佧瓦族的光荣。
    爱戛在训练班里安心愉快地工作和学习着，时间不觉又过了一个月，一天晚上?群指导员把他叫去，问他有什么困难，并提议让他回家去看看父母。爱戛说工作忙，不想回去。指导员说：“过去你们佧瓦族风俗是不在外面过夜的。一个月了，父母亲一定想了，另外还有……”虽然指导员没说出口，聪明的爱戛就已经知道说谁了，不觉红了脸。
    这次爱戛回家，背兜里装的鼓绷绷的，里面除了有给家里买的五斤盐以外，还有一块颜色鲜艳的花布。
    安道娃接到花布说：“阿哥，我看见了你的心。”
    他父亲说：“娃子，一定要好好听毛主席的话。”
    爱戛在训练班工作了一个时期以后，忽然听到一个使他异常兴奋的消息——在昆明的云南民族学院招生。当他刚想向指导员请求的时候，指导员早就把这件事考虑好了，并且已经在要送到昆明去学习的五名佧瓦族和拉祜族学员的名单上，填上了爱戛的名字。
