Xinhua News Agency, February 1st -- According to a report from the German News Agency: The West German Trade Union Federation held a mass rally on January 29th in St. Paul's Church in Frankfurt am Main to lay the foundation for a "People's Movement for the Restoration of German Unity." This is one of the most powerful demonstrations of the German Social Democratic Party's movement against the Paris Agreements.

At the rally, Luth, vice-chairman of the West German Trade Union Federation, who addressed more than 1,200 listeners, said that the issue of German rearmament could only be decided by the German people themselves, and not by a handful of parliamentarians. Also speaking at the rally were German Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer, former Bonn government Interior Minister Heinemann, and others, who all expressed that all Germans must fully support the struggle to defeat the Paris Agreements and help eliminate Germany's divided state.

The rally passed a "German Declaration," which stated: "An understanding must be reached among the four powers regarding the reunification (of Germany) before the establishment of military blocs. Conditions acceptable to Germany and its neighbors can and must be found in order to guarantee the peaceful coexistence of all European countries through German unification." The "German Declaration" has already been signed by 250 prominent figures, including Social Democratic Party members of the Bundestag, state parliamentarians, and trade union leaders.

The rally aroused great interest among the residents. Long before the opening of the meeting, the venue was full. In addition, hundreds of people gathered outside the venue to listen to the speeches through loudspeakers. Whenever speakers mentioned the demand for negotiations to reunify Germany, the audience erupted in prolonged cheers.

    西德法兰克福举行争取德国统一的大会
   【新华社一日讯】据德意志通讯社消息：西德工会联合会一月二十九日在美因河畔法兰克福的圣保罗教堂举行了为“争取恢复德国统一的人民运动”奠定基础的群众大会。这是德国社会民主党发动的反对巴黎协定运动的一次最有力的示威。
    在大会上向一千二百名以上的听众发表演说的西德工会联合会副主席路特说，德国重新武装问题只能由德国人民自己来决定，不能由一小撮议员决定。在大会上发言的还有德国社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔、前波恩政府内政部长海涅曼和其他人等，他们都表示全体德国人必须充分支持挫败巴黎协定的斗争，帮助消除德国的分裂状态。
    大会通过一项“德国宣言”，宣言说：“必须在成立军事集团之前，取得四国关于重新统一（德国）的协议的谅解。可以而且必须找到为德国和它的邻国所能够接受的条件，以便通过德国统一来保证欧洲各国的和平共处。”在“德国宣言”上签名的已经有二百五十名著名人士，其中有社会民主党的联邦议院议员、州议员和工会领袖等人。
  这次大会引起了居民的巨大兴趣。在大会开幕以前很久，会场就席无虚位。此外还有好几百人聚集在会场外面通过扩音器听大会上的演说。每当演说者提到要求为重新统一德国举行谈判的时候，听众们就发出长时期的欢呼。
