Comrade Chargé d'Affaires, Comrades, Friends:

The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance has been signed for five years. Today, we celebrate this fifth anniversary with great joy. I would like to take this opportunity to express, on behalf of the Chinese people and the Government of the People's Republic of China, our congratulations and gratitude to you, Comrade Chargé d'Affaires, and through you, to the great Soviet people and the Soviet Government.

The unbreakable brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people, cemented by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, has greatly developed in the past five years. Based on the common desire for mutual prosperity, the Soviet Government and the Soviet people have provided comprehensive, systematic, and enormous assistance to the Chinese people. This assistance has enabled the Chinese people to not only complete the task of economic recovery in a short period of five years but also to quickly enter the stage of planned construction, rapidly enhancing China's economic and defense capabilities, and promoting the smooth progress of the Chinese people's socialist construction and transformation. The Chinese people deeply feel the supreme value of Sino-Soviet friendship.

The facts of the past five years have proven that the friendly alliance between China and the Soviet Union is an important factor in safeguarding world peace. The peaceful policies consistently pursued by China and the Soviet Union have received the support of all peace-loving countries and people. Thanks to the efforts of China, the Soviet Union, and other peace-loving countries, the wars in Korea and Indochina have ceased, and the tense situation in the Far East has eased to some extent. However, the American aggressive bloc is actively reviving German militarism, preparing for atomic warfare, and organizing aggressive groups and establishing military bases everywhere to threaten and encircle the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and other People's Democratic countries, especially recently intensifying its aggression and war provocations against the Chinese people in the Taiwan area. All this seriously threatens peace in the Far East and the world, and makes the once eased international situation tense again. The aggressive acts and war cries of the American aggressive bloc have aroused the righteous condemnation and resolute opposition of the Chinese, Soviet, and all peace-loving people around the world.

We want to solemnly warn the American aggressive bloc: The Chinese people who have stood up, the Chinese people who have formed a solid alliance with the great Soviet people, the Chinese people who are strongly united with the People's Democratic countries, and the Chinese people who are supported by all peace-loving people in the world, have the determination and the strength to defend their territory, sovereignty, and achievements. If the American aggressive bloc dares to launch an aggressive attack on us, the Chinese people are determined to defeat it completely. We also want to solemnly warn the followers and appeasers of the American aggressive bloc: Past history proves that the result of aggressive war not only leads to the destruction of the aggressor themselves, but also brings no good results to the followers and appeasers of aggression. Striving for peace and easing international tensions is China's firm and unwavering foreign policy. However, severing the territory of any country, interfering in the internal affairs of any country, and infringing upon the sovereignty of any country can only encourage aggression and lead to war, and cannot bring peace. For the sake of world peace and the progress of mankind, the people of China and the Soviet Union will continue to stand together with all peace-loving countries and people in the world to resolutely oppose aggressive war and support all efforts that truly strengthen peace and develop friendly relations between countries.

Please allow me to propose a toast, for the common prosperity of the Chinese and Soviet people, for world peace and human progress, and for the unbreakable and eternal friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people!

### 周恩来总理的讲话

    周恩来总理的讲话敬爱的代办同志、同志们、朋友们：
    中苏友好同盟互助条约签订已经五年了，今天我们怀着愉快的心情来庆祝这个五周年纪念。我愿借此机会代表中国人民、中华人民共和国政府向您、代办同志，并通过您向伟大的苏联人民和苏联政府表示祝贺和感谢。
    中国人民和苏联人民用中苏友好同盟互助条约所固定下来的牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊，在过去五年中获得了极大的发展。苏联政府和苏联人民基于两国共同繁荣的愿望，给予了中国人民全面的、系统的、巨大的援助。这种援助使得中国人民有可能在短短的五年里不仅完成了经济恢复的工作，而且很快地进入了有计划的建设阶段，迅速增强了中国的经济力量和国防力量，推动了中国人民的社会主义建设和改造事业的顺利前进。中国人民深切地感到中苏友谊的无上珍贵。
    五年来的事实证明，中苏两大国的友好同盟是维护世界和平的重要因素，中苏两国一贯奉行的和平政策，得到了一切爱好和平的国家和人民的支持。由于中苏两国和其他爱好和平国家的努力，在朝鲜和印度支那的战争停止了，远东的紧张局势有了一定的和缓。但是美国侵略集团却积极复活德国军国主义，准备原子战争，到处组织侵略集团和建立军事基地，来威胁和包围苏联、中华人民共和国和各人民民主国家，特别是最近以来在台湾地区对中国人民加紧进行侵略和战争挑衅。这一切严重地威胁着远东和世界的和平，使一度缓和的国际局势又趋紧张。美国侵略集团的侵略行为和战争叫嚣，引起了中国、苏联和全世界一切爱好和平的人民的正义谴责和坚决反对。
    我们要正告美国侵略集团：站起来了的中国人民，同伟大的苏联人民结成了巩固的同盟的中国人民，同各人民民主国家坚强地团结在一起的中国人民，得到世界上一切爱好和平的人民支持的中国人民，有决心也有力量来保卫自己的领土、主权和胜利成果。如果美国侵略集团敢于向我们发动侵略进攻，中国人民有决心使它失败到底。我们也要正告美国侵略集团的追随者和姑息者：过去的历史证明，侵略战争的结果不仅使侵略者自己招致了覆灭，而且也没有为侵略的追随者和姑息者带来任何好的结果。争取和平、和缓国际紧张局势是中国的坚定不移的外交政策。但是，割裂任何一个国家的领土、干涉任何一个国家的内政和侵犯任何一个国家的主权，只能助长侵略和导致战争，是不能带来和平的。为了世界和平和人类进步的利益，中苏两国人民将继续同全世界一切爱好和平的国家和人民一起，坚决反对侵略战争，支持一切真正加强和平和发展各国友好关系的努力。
    请允许我建议，为中苏两国人民的共同繁荣，为世界和平和人类进步，为中苏两国人民牢不可破的永恒的友谊干杯！
