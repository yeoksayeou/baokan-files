Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 3rd: Indian public opinion continues to condemn the United States for its aggression against China and calls on the Indian people to actively participate in the "U.S. Troops Get Out of Taiwan Day" scheduled for February 6th.

    The "New Century News" published an editorial on January 29th, saying that the so-called "ceasefire" in the Taiwan Strait is merely a conspiracy by American war-mongers to cover up their military reinforcement of Taiwan and expansion of their aggressive activities in the region. The editorial said, "The world is witnessing the most shameful example of imperialism engaging in deception and blackmail."

    The newspaper pointed out that the current tension in the Taiwan issue "is caused by the U.S. imperialists' interference in China's internal affairs and their attempt to seize Taiwan to complete their war plans." The editorial called on peace forces to actively participate in "U.S. Troops Get Out of Taiwan Day" and loudly voice their opposition to the American war plans.

    The "Freedom News" published an editorial on January 27th, saying, "We can no longer sit idly by in the face of American armed interference in China's internal affairs. It is not only China that faces danger, but the whole of Asia, and India is certainly included." The editorial called on the Indian people to actively participate in the movement demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Taiwan.

    Mohammed Ilyas, General Secretary of the Bengal Provincial Trade Union Congress, delivered a speech in support of "U.S. Troops Get Out of Taiwan Day." He said, "The presence of U.S. armed forces in Taiwan is a direct violation of the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China." He said, "The Indian working class must step up its demand that U.S. troops withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan area in accordance with the Five Principles jointly issued by the Prime Ministers of China and India."

    According to Xinhua News Agency: Indian newspapers widely commented on the United States' interference in China's internal affairs on the Taiwan issue and the so-called ceasefire proposal.

    The Urdu daily "Glory" editorialized on February 3:
  "New Zealand's proposal is nothing more than something completely in line with the wishes of the United States." In exposing the U.S.'s aggressive policy towards Taiwan, the newspaper said: "Now that the United States realizes that Chiang Kai-shek is unable to resist the Chinese Communist army's attack on Taiwan, it has put forward such a theory: China has no right to acquire Taiwan, and Taiwan should be declared an 'independent country'. The sole purpose of this 'independent country' is: Taiwan must never fall into the hands of the Chinese Communists, and the United States should establish its actual rule over that island in the name of defending Taiwan." "Glory" condemned the United States' interference in China's internal affairs, saying: "It is very obvious: on the Taiwan issue, the United States is adopting a thorough and aggressive attitude. The United States is a signatory to the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation issued during World War II, and it has an obligation to recognize China's rights over Taiwan. Therefore, morally, the United States has no right to send troops to Taiwan or threaten China."

    The "Assam Tribune" said in an editorial on January 31:
  "The United States seems even more enthusiastic about provoking a war against China over the Taiwan issue." The editorial said that if a war between the United States and China is triggered by the provocative actions of the U.S. government, "all the responsibility lies with the reckless and unrealistic policies implemented by the United States."

    The "Hindi Daily" believes that "If the United States claims to be an advocate of world peace and does not want to turn Asia into a battlefield, then today is the best time for it to withdraw from Taiwan and the nearby islands, and the United States should keep Chiang Kai-shek in a museum in Washington or New York."

      "The Statesman" condemned the United States for interfering in China's internal affairs, emphasizing that India believes without reservation that Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory and therefore must be returned to the People's Republic of China in accordance with the Cairo and Potsdam agreements.

    The Bengali newspaper "The Earth" wrote: After the end of World War II, the United States has repeatedly violated international treaties and obligations. The newspaper said that the policy of establishing military groups such as the Middle East Group, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, and the treaty concluded with Chiang Kai-shek are all nothing more than tricks by the United States to maintain the colonial system in Asia. This explains why the United States wants to continue to occupy Taiwan—an inseparable part of China. Awakened Asia cannot tolerate any foreign interference or domination. For independence and progress, Asia must do everything possible to oppose foreign interference in its internal affairs.

### 印度舆论号召人民参加要美军“撤出台湾日”

    印度舆论号召人民参加要美军“撤出台湾日”
   【新华社新德里三日电】印度舆论继续谴责美国侵略中国，并且号召印度人民积极参加预定在二月六日举行的“撤出台湾日”。
    “新世纪报”一月二十九日发表社论说，所谓在台湾海峡“停火”，只不过是掩护美国战争贩子对台湾进行军事增援和扩大他们在这个地区的侵略行动的阴谋。社论说，“全世界正在看到帝国主义进行欺骗和讹诈的最可耻的实例。”
    报纸指出，目前在台湾问题上的紧张局势，是“由于美帝国主义者干涉中国内政而引起的，也是因为他们企图攫取台湾以完成他们的战争计划而引起的”。社论号召和平的力量积极参加“撤出台湾日”，并且响亮地喊出反对美国战争计划的呼声。
    “自由报”一月二十七日发表社论说，“在美国武装干涉中国内政的情况下，我们不能再静坐着无动于衷了。面临着危险的不仅是中国，而且是整个亚洲，印度当然也包括在内。”社论号召印度人民积极参加要求美国撤出台湾的运动。
    孟加拉省总工会总书记穆罕默德·伊利雅斯发表演说支持“撤出台湾日”。他说，“美国武装部队驻在台湾是直接侵犯中华人民共和国的主权的行为。”他说，“印度工人阶级必须加紧要求美国部队根据中印两国总理联合发表的五项原则撤出台湾和台湾地区。”
    据新华社讯：印度报纸广泛评论美国在台湾问题上对中国内政的干涉和所谓停火建议。
    二月三日的乌尔都文日报“光荣报”的社论说：
  “新西兰的提案不是别的，而是跟美国的愿望完全一样的东西。”这家报纸在揭露美国对于台湾的侵略政策时说：“美国现在认识到蒋介石无力抵抗中国共产党军队对台湾的进攻以后，它就提出这样的理论：中国没有取得台湾的权利，台湾应该宣布为‘独立国’。这种‘独立国’的唯一用意是：台湾绝不应当落到中国共产党的手里，而美国应当以保卫台湾的名义建立它对于那个岛屿的实际的统治。”“光荣报”谴责美国干涉中国内政说：“非常明显：在台湾问题上，美国是抱着彻头彻尾的侵略态度。美国是在第二次世界大战时发表的开罗宣言和波茨坦公告的签字国，它有义务承认中国对于台湾的权利。因此，在道义上，美国没有权利派遣军队到台湾去或者向中国进行威吓。”
    一月三十一日的“阿萨姆论坛报”在社论中说：
  “美国似乎更加热中于在台湾问题上挑起对中国的战争。”社论说，如果由于美国政府的挑衅行动而引起了美国和中国的战争的话，“一切的责任都在于美国所实行的冒失的和不现实的政策”。
    “印度文汇报”认为，“如果美国声称是世界和平的拥护者，并且不愿意使亚洲变成一个战场的话，那么今天是它撤出台湾以及附近的岛屿的最好的时候了，并且美国应该把蒋介石保存在华盛顿或是纽约的一个博物馆里。”
      “政治家报”谴责美国干涉中国内政，强调指出印度毫无保留地认为台湾是中国领土的不可分割的一部分，因此必须按照开罗和波茨坦协定归还给中华人民共和国。
    孟加拉文报纸“大地报”写道：在第二次世界大战结束以后，美国曾经多次违反国际条约和义务。这家报纸说，建立像中东集团那样的军事集团的政策、东南亚条约组织和同蒋介石缔结的条约都不过是美国为了保持亚洲的殖民制度而干的勾当罢了。这说明美国为什么希望继续占领台湾——中国的不可分割的一部分。觉醒了的亚洲决不能容忍任何外国干涉或统治。为了独立和进步，亚洲必须尽一切力量反对外国干涉它的内政。
