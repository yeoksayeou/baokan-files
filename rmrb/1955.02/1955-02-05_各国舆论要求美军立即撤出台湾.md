International Public Opinion Demands the Immediate Withdrawal of U.S. Troops from Taiwan
Pakistani Newspapers Say
The Only Way to Resolve the Taiwan Issue is for the U.S. to Withdraw from Taiwan
Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, 4th: The January 30th "Today's News" international commentary wrote: "The United States' purpose in implementing a ceasefire through the United Nations is to want democratic China to recognize Taiwan as a part outside of China." The newspaper pointed out that, according to international treaties, Taiwan is an indivisible part of China. The newspaper said, "If the United States does not interfere in China's civil war, this civil war will not have the slightest impact on world peace. A ceasefire is a matter for both sides, but now there is only one side, China, who is it going to have a ceasefire with?" The newspaper pointed out that the only way to resolve the Taiwan issue "is for the United States to withdraw from Taiwan."

"Today's News" also refuted Eden's "strange logic" that China should "endure" American aggression, calling it "reversing black and white, confusing right and wrong."

The "Pakistan Times" on January 28th accused the United States of creating new tensions with its recent series of war provocations. The newspaper said that the United States is now attempting to intimidate the United Nations into once again defending the United States, attempting to "use the organization's power to defend the Kuomintang remnants in Taiwan and American interests in the Far East... and obstruct the liberation of Taiwan and China's small islands." The newspaper pointed out, "If all international law and international morality can be invoked in the name of American security to justify America's permanent control of islands belonging to China, then the concepts of national independence and sovereignty and the right to defend territorial integrity are completely meaningless."

The "Pakistan Observer" published in Dhaka on January 25th pointed out, "The most complex factor in the Taiwan issue is that the United States considers this island an important part of its defense perimeter, and this island is thousands of miles from the nearest American coast." After quoting the Cairo Declaration, the newspaper wrote, "According to historical, wartime promises, China's exercise of sovereignty over this island is completely unquestionable."

London Cooperative Political Committee Resolution Says
British Government Should Not Support U.S. Interference in China's Internal Affairs
Xinhua News Agency, London, 4th: TASS London, 4th: The Political Committee of the London Cooperative, with one million members, passed a resolution condemning the United States for interfering in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China. The resolution called on the British government to declare to the United States that if the United States stubbornly implements its plan to interfere in China's internal affairs, then the United States should not expect to receive British support.

The resolution emphasized that the rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations must be restored. The resolution stated, "We draw attention to the fact that both the British and American governments have publicly recognized Taiwan as part of Chinese territory. ...Therefore, we demand that the United States armed forces withdraw from this island as a first step towards peace."

Copies of the resolution have been submitted to the National Committee of the British Cooperative Party and the American Ambassador to London.

The London Cooperative Political Committee also passed the following resolution on the German issue: "We call on the National Committee of the Cooperative Party to urge all Cooperative Party and Labour Party members of Parliament to pay attention to the recent Soviet proposal for free all-German elections under international supervision. We call on the National Committee to urge MPs to seek full consideration of this proposal before taking further steps to arm West Germany."

Xinhua News Agency, London: The British weekly "Tribune" said that if Eisenhower insists on implementing his current policy towards Communist China on the Taiwan issue, "the entire Atlantic alliance will be placed in a dangerous position."

The weekly said, "No one will doubt the provocations that have already been carried out against the Chinese Communist Party." The weekly believes that Britain should completely break away from American policy.

The "Tribune" weekly pointed out that Labour leader Attlee "has made it clear that the British Labour movement will not participate in interference in the Chinese civil war." The weekly said, "This is of course not only a condemnation of the American policy towards Jinmen, but also a condemnation of the American policy towards Taiwan."

Syrian "Souriya al-Jadida" Newspaper Points Out
The Chinese People are Determined to Liberate Taiwan from the Hands of the Chiang Kai-shek Bandits
Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, 3rd: TASS Beirut, 3rd: The Syrian "Souriya al-Jadida" newspaper emphasized that the Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan from the hands of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. It wrote that some people have been trying to distort the truth about China for years. They insist on refusing to recognize in the United Nations that "since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, a red sun has risen above the great Chinese people."

The newspaper then said: "There is no doubt that since then, the majority of countries in the United Nations have long known the truth about the new China, and hope to correct the existing situation by allowing the new China to participate in the United Nations. However, the United States is still stubbornly opposed to this."

Belgian "Red Flag" Newspaper Editorial Says
U.S. Government Should Bear Full Responsibility for the Taiwan Situation
Xinhua News Agency, Brussels: According to TASS Brussels: The Belgian "Red Flag" published an editorial on the 3rd entitled "Who is Threatening Peace?" It stated: The situation in the Taiwan area clearly proves who should be held responsible for the current international tensions. No one can seriously say that the United States deployed its garrison forces in an area more than 10,000 kilometers from the American coast and within the range of Chinese mainland artillery for the necessity of American defense. British Labour's Attlee and Indian Prime Minister Nehru also did not hesitate to declare that the U.S. government should bear full responsibility for the situation in the Taiwan area.

"Red Flag" called for a firm condemnation of the imperialists' adventurist policies.

Danish "Land and People" Newspaper Editorial Says
No U.S. War Threats Against China Allowed
Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen: The Danish "Land and People" published an editorial on January 26th condemning U.S. interference in China's internal affairs. The editorial pointed out that the Taiwan Strait has nothing to do with the United States. The United States attempts to threaten China, with a population of 600 million, by launching a war and implementing an aggressive plan in the East.

The editorial called on peace-loving people to rise up against war, against the arming of West Germany and the use of atomic weapons. The editorial also demanded that the Danish government oppose war in accordance with the will of the Danish people and should not allow the United States to threaten China.

    各国舆论要求美军立即撤出台湾
    巴基斯坦报纸说
    要解决台湾问题只有美国撤出台湾
   【新华社四日讯】喀喇蚩消息：一月三十日“今天报”的国际评论写道：“美国通过联合国实行停火的目的，是想要民主中国承认台湾是中国以外的一个部分。”报纸指出，按照国际条约，台湾是中国不可分割的部分。报纸说，“假如美国不干涉中国内战，这个内战对世界和平不会有丝毫影响。停战是双方的事情，现在只有中国一方，它来和谁停战呢”。报纸指出，解决台湾问题“只有一个办法，那就是美国撤出台湾。”
    “今天报”还驳斥艾登所谓中国对美国侵略应该“忍耐”的“奇怪的逻辑”，是“颠倒黑白，混淆是非”。
    “巴基斯坦时报”一月二十八日指责美国最近一系列的战争挑衅制造了新的紧张。报纸说，现在美国又企图威吓联合国再一次为美国辩护，企图“利用这个组织的权力来卫护在台湾的国民党残余和美国在远东的利益……阻挠台湾和中国的小岛的解放。”报纸指出，“如果一切国际法和国际道义能被美国的安全这个名义所假借，来证明美国永远控制属于中国的岛屿的行为是正当的，那么一切国家独立和主权的观念和保卫领土完整的权利，就完全没有意义了。”
    达卡出版的“巴基斯坦观察家报”一月二十五日指出，“台湾问题最复杂的因素就是美国认为这个岛是它的防御圈的重要部分，而这个岛离最近的美国海岸也有数千哩”，报纸在引述开罗宣言后写道，“按照历史的、战时的诺言，中国对这个岛行使主权是完全不能置疑的”。伦敦合作社政治委员会决议说
    英政府不要支持美国干涉中国内政
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社伦敦四日讯：有一百万社员的伦敦合作社的政治委员会通过一项决议，谴责美国干涉中华人民共和国内政。决议要求英国政府向美国声明：如果美国顽固地执行它干涉中国内政的计划，那么美国就不要打算得到英国的支持。
    决议强调指出，必须恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的权利。决议中说道，“我们提醒注意，英国和美国政府都曾公开地承认了台湾是中国领土的一部分。……因此，我们要求美国武装部队从这个岛屿撤退，作为走向和平的第一步。”
    决议副本已分别递交英国合作党全国委员会和美国驻伦敦大使。
    伦敦合作社政治委员会还就德国问题通过下列决议：“我们要求合作党全国委员会敦请所有合作党和工党议员注意最近苏联关于在国际监督下进行全德自由选举的建议。我们要求全国委员会敦请议员们在采取进一步骤武装西德之前，争取全面地考虑这一建议。”
   【新华社四日讯】伦敦消息：英国“论坛”周报说，如果艾森豪威尔坚持实行他目前在台湾问题上对共产党中国的政策，“整个大西洋联盟将被置于危险的地位”。
    周报说，“对于已经向中国共产党进行的挑衅谁也不会怀疑”。周报认为，英国应该同美国政策完全断绝关系。
    “论坛”周报指出，工党领袖艾德礼“已经表明，英国劳工运动将不参加对中国内战的干涉。”周报说，“这当然不仅是对于美国对金门的政策，而且同样也是对于美国对台湾的政策的谴责。”叙利亚“苏里贾迪德报”指出
     中国人民决心从蒋贼手中解放台湾
   【新华社四日讯】塔斯社贝鲁特三日讯：叙利亚“苏里贾迪德报”着重指出中国人民决心要把台湾从蒋介石匪帮手中解放出来。它写道，有些人几年来始终在尽力歪曲关于中国的真相。他们在联合国中坚持拒绝承认：“由于中华人民共和国的成立，一轮红日已经升在伟大的中国人民的上空”。
    这家报纸接着说：“毫无疑问，从那时以来，联合国中大多数国家早已知道关于新中国的真相，并且希望以准许新中国参加联合国的办法来改正现存的局势。但是，美国却依然顽固地反对这点。”比利时“红旗报”社论说
    美政府应对台湾局势负全部责任
    【新华社四日讯】据塔斯社布鲁塞尔讯：比利时“红旗报”在三日发表题为“是谁威胁和平？”的社论说：台湾地区的局势，特别明显地证明是谁应该对目前国际紧张局势负责。没有人能够认真地说，美国把自己的卫戍部队布置在离美国海岸一万多公里、在中国大陆的炮火射程之内的地区，是为了美国国防的必要。英国工党的艾德礼和印度总理尼赫鲁也毫不犹豫地宣称，美国政府应对台湾地区的局势担负全部的责任。
    “红旗报”要求坚决谴责帝国主义者的冒险政策。丹麦“国土与人民报”社论说
    不许美国对中国进行战争威胁
    【新华社四日讯】哥本哈根消息：丹麦“国土与人民报”一月二十六日发表社论，谴责美国干涉中国内政。社论指出，台湾海峡与美国毫不相干。美国企图用发动战争，来威胁六亿人口的中国，在东方推行侵略计划。
    社论号召爱好和平的人民起来反对战争，反对武装西德和使用原子武器。社论并且要求丹麦政府根据丹麦人民的意志反对战争，不应该让美国威胁中国。
