    Many people are familiar with the name Kong Jue. He is a "writer," the author of the novel "New Heroes and Heroines." But his name is also frequently and closely associated with such hateful words as moral degradation and licentiousness.

    Can a writer lead a double life? What a great irony it is when someone called an "engineer of the human soul" has an extremely ugly soul himself!

    Let's put the stinking, moldy parts out in the sunlight for a look! Doing so can at least reduce the chances of young people being infected by mold, and reduce the amount of deception and poisoning.

    This is not an unnecessary worry. Not long ago, two young women, both under twenty years old, were defiled by Kong Jue.

    In mid-July of last year, Kong Jue met an eighteen-year-old female cadre on the train to Shenyang. Needless to say, the sign of the author of "New Heroes and Heroines" "could well" be used as Kong Jue's "capital" for deception and bewilderment. Thus, in a hotel in Shenyang, this female cadre was seduced by this "writer." Afterwards, Kong Jue claimed he would marry her; bought her things, sent her money; promised to take care of her family life; advised her to resign from her job and study stenography in Beijing, so that she could not only become his "lovely companion" in the future, but also become his "most valuable assistant" in his work, that is, become his appendage; when corresponding with her, he used flowery words, coaxing and enticing, using all kinds of means. He even advised this female cadre not to hand over her Communist Youth League membership when she followed his advice and left her revolutionary work, and went to a stenography school in Beijing through his private introduction, in order to have more freedom of action. Until December of last year, Kong Jue seemed to feel that the wind was not quite right, so he wrote to the stenography school again, saying that he originally wanted to use a private stenographer, so he sent that female cadre to be trained, but now he "rarely collects materials" and "it will have a bad influence," saying that she should be assigned work by the organization; later, he personally said to her in Beijing: you are only eighteen years old this year, I am so old, don't count on me. - He had played with her enough and then dumped her.

    Look, a young woman was ruined by a "writer" like this! This young woman has filed a complaint with the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association. Isn't this a completely justified complaint?

    Another person who was deceived by this "writer" was a female student who had just graduated from high school - also a member of the Communist Youth League. This happened after Kong Jue arrived in Beijing in August of last year. At this time, he and the female cadre mentioned earlier were in the heat of "love," yearning for a "happy life" in the future.

    For this female student, Kong Jue used another set of despicable tricks. He repeatedly publicized that this female student loved him to the point of fanaticism, saying that she hoped to "change her surname to Kong," and was willing to "work, study and live together" with Kong Jue and his wife, "living in peace" and "never being jealous." Kong Jue even wrote letters to his wife begging for "mercy," and the signature of one letter actually read "The person hanging upside down weeps blood and bows repeatedly, again and again."

    Take a look at the ugly behavior of this "writer"! May I ask: is there anything clean left in the soul of this "writer"?

    Kong Jue's set of completely rotten hooligan behavior did not just start recently. As early as 1944, during the difficult period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, as a Communist Party member, a writer, and a married man, he had an illicit relationship with a married woman; at that time, the Party gave him a severe punishment. But the licentious and shameless Kong Jue did not pay attention to the Party's advice. Then, in 1945, he had a relationship with a female teacher, in 1948 he had a relationship with the landlord's daughter when he participated in land reform in central Hebei, in 1949 he had an improper love affair in Beijing, and in 1951 he even went to a prostitute in Shenyang. Kong Jue's licentiousness and shamelessness even developed to the point that when he was working on the front line of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, he once again repeated the same kind of insane crimes.

    Is this something anyone can tolerate? Who can suppress their anger when they hear these scandals? After the Chinese Communist Party branch of Kong Jue's unit discovered these crimes, it expelled this morally degenerate person from the Party in 1952.

    But in order to give Kong Jue a final chance to reform, the organization still assigned him to live in a factory, hoping that he could be reformed. However, his answer to the people was to sink deeper and deeper into the mire of sin without any intention of turning back. In the past year, we can list a report of Kong Jue's experience of life on a construction site in Northeast China: from February to July 1954, he only attended some meetings, lived in a six-room building, wanted a car, and did not go deep into the work area at all; in July, he went to Shenyang, where he spent a few days in absurd life of moral decay, and kept writing love letters after returning to the construction site; in August and September, he was in Beijing, playing with two young women at the same time, and "weeping blood and bowing" to his wife; in October, he traveled to Dalian; in November, he returned to the construction site and studied Russian in the Russian class; in December, he went to the work area once, and in mid-December, he ran back to Beijing again. In addition, he often quarreled and filed for divorce. Can we hope that such a person who has no enthusiasm or interest in socialist construction and whose personal moral character is so bad can write anything? Even if he barely writes something, who would want to read the hypocrisy and pretense of this stinking, moldy person?

    Kong Jue's soul has been infiltrated with the rotten blood of the bourgeoisie. Such a person is not only completely unworthy of the glorious title of writer, but also violates the morality of being human. We believe that the decision of the Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association to expel Kong Jue from membership is completely correct. We support this decision. We also want to solemnly warn Kong Jue: Arbitrary and reckless behavior is absolutely intolerable to the people and the people's literary and art ranks! Misconduct that disregards laws and disciplines and undermines morality is absolutely intolerable to the laws of our country!

    The glorious responsibility of writers - the engineers of the human soul - is to cultivate the communist moral qualities of the people with their works. It is not difficult to imagine that the moral qualities of writers themselves should also become a model for the people to learn from, like Lu Xun and Gorky - this is also an important condition for people's writers to fulfill their glorious responsibilities. Any morally corrupt behavior is completely incompatible with the title of engineer of the human soul. Now, a morally degenerate element has been expelled from our ranks! This is a victory for our literary and artistic front! But this does not mean that our ranks have been purged of other various kinds of bad behavior with different degrees of moral flaws. Profoundly learning the lessons of the Kong Jue incident and continuing to fight to purify our ranks is one of the current tasks of the literary and art circles. For the prosperity of our cause, it is time to earnestly shoulder this task! (Originally published in "Wenyi Bao" No. 3, 1955)

### 请看看孔厥的丑恶行为

    请看看孔厥的丑恶行为
    “文艺报”记者
    很多人都熟悉孔厥这个名字。他是一位“作家”，是小说“新儿女英雄传”的作者。但他这个名字又是经常和道德堕落、荒淫无耻这一类可恶的字眼紧密地联系在一起的。
    一位作家，难道可以过着两重生活吗？一个被称为“人类灵魂工程师”的人，自己的灵魂却极端丑恶，这该是多么大的讽刺！
    把臭得要发霉的部分拿到太阳光下照照吧！这样做，至少可以使得青年人少受霉菌的传染，少受一些欺骗和毒害。
    这并不是多余的顾虑。就在不久以前，两个不到二十岁的女青年被孔厥污害了。
    去年七月中旬，孔厥在去沈阳的火车上结识了一位才十八岁的女干部。不用说，“新儿女英雄传”的作者这块招牌，“满可以”作为孔厥进行欺骗和迷惑人的“资本”的。就这样，在沈阳的一个旅馆里，这个女干部被这位“作家”诱奸了。事后，孔厥声称要和她结婚；给她买东西、寄钱；答应负担她的家庭生活；劝她辞去工作，到北京学习速记，以便将来不仅成为他的“可爱的伴侣”，而且成为他“工作上最宝贵的助手”，也就是成为他的附属品；和她通信时，花言巧语，哄骗利诱，各种手段是应有尽有。甚至当这个女干部听了他的话离开了革命工作，通过他私人的介绍到北京某速记学校学习时，孔厥竟劝她不要交出青年团员的关系，以便行动自由些。直到去年十二月，孔厥似乎感到风声不大对，就又向速记学校写信说，本来他是要用一个私人速记员，才送那个女干部去培养的，现在则“收集材料的时候很少”，“会产生不良影响”，说理应把她交由组织分配工作；后来又在北京亲自对她说：你今年才十八岁，我都这么大了，你别指望我了。——玩弄够了，就甩开她。
    看，一个女青年就是这样被一位“作家”糟蹋了的！这个女青年已经向中国作家协会主席团提出了控诉。这不是完全正义的控诉么？
    另一个被这位“作家”欺骗了的，是一个刚刚从高中毕业的女学生——也是一个青年团员。这是孔厥去年八月到北京以后的事。就在这时候，他和刚才提到的那个女干部正在火热的“爱情”之中，向往着未来的“美满生活”呢。
    对于这个女学生，孔厥耍弄的是另一套卑鄙手腕。他再三宣传，说这个女学生爱他爱到狂热的程度，说她希望“改姓孔”，愿意和孔厥夫妇“一起工作、学习、生活”，“和平共居”，“绝不吃醋”。孔厥甚至写信向他的妻子苦苦哀求“饶命”，有一封信的署名处居然写着“倒悬的人泣血顿首再拜再拜”。
    请看看这位“作家”的丑恶行径吧！试问：这位“作家”的灵魂里还有一点干净的东西吗？
    孔厥这一套腐烂透顶的流氓行为，还并不是从最近才开始的。远在抗日战争艰苦时期的一九四四年，作为一个共产党员的作家和一个有妻子的人，他就曾非法地跟一位有夫之妇发生过关系；当时党就曾给了他严重的处分。但荒淫无耻的孔厥对党的忠告是并不理睬的。接着在一九四五年又和一个女教员发生关系，一九四八年在冀中参加土地改革时又与房东的女儿发生关系，一九四九年在北京又曾进行过不正当的恋爱，一九五一年在沈阳时并曾去嫖妓。孔厥的荒淫无耻，甚至发展到在抗美援朝前线工作的时候，竟又再一次重复着同类性质的丧心病狂的罪恶。
    这是任何人能够容忍得了的吗？谁听到这些丑闻能够抑制住自己的愤怒？当孔厥所在机关的中国共产党支部发现了他这些罪恶以后，在一九五二年将这个道德上的堕落分子开除了党籍。
    但为了给孔厥一个最后锻炼的机会，组织上仍然分配他去工厂生活，希望他能得到改造。然而，他对人民的回答，却是越来越深地陷入罪恶泥坑而无心回头。最近一年来，孔厥在东北某工地体验生活的情形，我们可以给他列一张清单：一九五四年二月到七月只参加了一些会议，住着六间楼房，要汽车，根本没有深入工区；七月去一趟沈阳，在那里度过几天败坏道德的荒唐生活，回工地后不断地写情书；八月、九月在北京，同时玩弄两个女青年，向他妻子“泣血顿首”；十月去大连旅行；十一月回工地，到俄文班学俄文；十二月到工区去过一次，十二月中旬又跑回北京。此外就是经常吵架、闹离婚。我们能够希望这样一个对社会主义建设毫无热情和兴趣，而个人道德品质又如此恶劣的人写出什么来呢？就是勉强写出来，谁又愿意去看这种臭得发霉的人的虚伪造作呢？
    孔厥的灵魂深处已经浸透了腐烂的资产阶级的血液。这样的人不仅已经完全不配冠戴作家这个光荣称号，而且也有背于为人的道德。我们认为：中国作家协会主席团开除孔厥会籍的决定是完全正确的。我们拥护这个决定。我们并要正告孔厥：任意地胡作非为是人民和人民的文艺队伍决不能容许的！玩忽法纪和败坏道德的丑行，是我们国家的法律决不能容许的！
    作家——人类灵魂的工程师的光荣的职责，是以自己的作品培养人民的共产主义道德品质。不难想像：作家自己的道德品质同样是应当成为人民学习的榜样，如像鲁迅和高尔基那样的——这也正是人民的作家能够完成其光荣职责的一个重要条件。任何道德败坏的行为，都是和人类灵魂工程师的称号绝不相容的。现在，一个道德上的堕落分子已经从我们的队伍里驱逐出去了！这是我们文艺战线的胜利！但这决不是说，我们的队伍里就已经肃清了其它各式各样的与各种不同程度的品质恶劣的行为。深刻接受孔厥事件的教训，为纯洁我们的队伍继续进行斗争，这是文艺界当前的任务之一。为了我们事业的繁荣，是切实担负起这个任务的时候了！（原载“文艺报”一九五五年第三号）
