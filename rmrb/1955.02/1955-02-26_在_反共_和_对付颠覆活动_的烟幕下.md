    Under the Smoke Screen of "Anti-Communism" and "Countering Subversion"
    Feng Zhidan
    One of the topics announced for discussion at the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO) council meeting currently being held in Bangkok is the so-called "countering of communist subversion." According to revealed information, the meeting has decided to establish a special committee to be responsible for planning measures in this regard. Following the keynote set by U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, the propaganda machine of the United States and its followers has recently been tirelessly clamoring about the "threat of communist subversion" in the Southeast Asian region.
    It is nothing new for imperialist colonialists and war instigators to use the smoke screen of "anti-communism" to conceal their acts of aggression and war-mongering. Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo organized an aggressive axis under the banner of the "Anti-Comintern Pact." Now the U.S. aggressive bloc has gone a step further, playing the trick of so-called "preventing subversive activities" in the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, infringe upon the sovereignty of other countries, and prepare for new wars.
    One of the U.S. imperialism's usual tactics is to slander the party it intends to harm while engaging in evil deeds and plotting sinister conspiracies. This time is no exception. Hidden beneath the smokescreen of "preventing communist subversion" are truly large-scale subversive activities, which have become a part of U.S. foreign policy, with the aim of maintaining and establishing imperialist colonial rule. Western sources revealed that Dulles brought a "preventing subversion activities" plan to the Bangkok conference. An Associated Press dispatch on February 19th stated: The Bangkok conference on "communist subversion" will formulate an "unpublished" "plan" that will involve "training Asian personnel to engage in underground activities and using propaganda organizations to send them to the edges of communist Asia." A Reuters dispatch on February 19th stated that the "anti-subversion committee" to be established at the Bangkok conference "will be a political investigative agency." It is clear at a glance that this is a special agent program planned by the U.S. aggressive bloc to interfere in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries and carry out subversive activities, with the People's Republic of China and various sovereign states in Southeast Asia as its targets of harm.
    The fact that the United States is engaged in sinister espionage and sabotage activities in Asian countries is well known. The United States' espionage and sabotage activities against the People's Republic of China are particularly rampant. Many of the spy organizations that have been uncovered are related to the United States. The recent court verdicts in our country in the cases of the Tangney and other spy cases and the spy case of the so-called "Free China Movement" that infiltrated our Guangdong territory are proof of this. The United States and its chorus are tirelessly fabricating the shameless slander that "aggression and subversive activities come from China," which is nothing more than a way to divert the attention of the international public in order to cover up the fact that the United States is invading China and carrying out evil activities against China and other Asian countries.
    The essence of the U.S.'s so-called "preventing subversion activities" is actually to prevent the Asian people from having democracy, freedom, and national independence, which is very clearly demonstrated in the U.S.'s activities interfering in the Indochina situation. The U.S. aggressive bloc describes the Vietnamese people's efforts to achieve national reunification through democratic general elections in accordance with the Geneva Accords as a so-called "danger of subversion"; while the illegal actions of the U.S. violating the Geneva Accords and interfering in the Indochina situation are described as "preventing subversion activities." The U.S. magazine "Look" admits that "the vast majority of Vietnamese would vote for the communists." The London "Times" also said that the residents of South Vietnam "feel that the Viet Minh represents hope." Needless to say, this is precisely what the U.S. aggressive bloc calls the "danger of subversion." However, who the Vietnamese people support and who they will vote for is entirely the free right of the Vietnamese people according to the provisions of the Geneva Accords. The United States is a participating country in the Geneva Conference, and it should have undertaken the international obligation to ensure that the people of Indochina obtain national unity. However, the United States tramples on international agreements, is determined to undermine the democratic general elections in Indochina, undermine the ceasefire in Indochina, and attempts to "establish a war machine in South Vietnam similar to that of South Korea." Already revealed news about the Bangkok conference indicates that this is precisely the major conspiracy that the United States is planning at the conference.
    The conspiracy of "preventing subversion activities" planned by the United States at the Bangkok conference is also aimed at countries in the Southeast Asian region that are unwilling to follow the U.S. war policy and sell out their national independence and sovereignty. The United States has been exerting various pressures on these countries, and even resorting to the most despicable means, in an attempt to force them to abandon their independent and autonomous policies and join its aggressive military bloc. Some facts recently revealed in Indonesia provide a typical example of a U.S.-style subversive conspiracy. The Indonesian Minister of Justice accused "foreign elements of not only trying to eliminate the Sastroamidjojo cabinet, but also trying to eliminate the independence of this republic." The "Indonesia News" also revealed that "Kuomintang Chinese and U.S. dollars... are plotting" to overthrow the current government of Indonesia. In order to achieve this subversive goal, the United States is not only plotting political conspiracies there, but also directly participating in armed rebellions. Recently, newspapers in Jakarta revealed evidence of U.S. support for the armed rebellion of the so-called "Republic of South Maluku"—a "Republic of South Maluku" stamp printed in the United States and bearing the image of U.S. General MacArthur. In addition, during interrogations by Indonesian state agencies, rebels confessed that aircraft from the U.S. Embassy and aircraft from the U.S. New Jersey-New York Mobil Corporation also airdropped weapons to the rebels of the "Islamic State Movement" in Indonesia, funding them to continuously create riots and disrupt the peaceful life of the Indonesian people. The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta has connections with armed rebel groups within Indonesia.
    The United States' blatant interference in Indonesia's internal affairs clearly shows that it is the U.S. aggressive bloc that threatens the national rights and independence and sovereignty of Asian countries.
    At the Bangkok conference, Dulles hypocritically babbled that the Manila Treaty could "guarantee the independence, integrity, and welfare of the people of friendly and free countries." This is a sharp irony of the U.S.'s policy of wantonly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and undermining the independence and sovereignty of various countries. The U.S. aggressive bloc uses the excuse of "protecting" other countries "from communist aggression," but in essence, it wants to deprive all countries of their independence and sovereignty and turn them into U.S. colonies and military bases in order to serve the purpose of establishing a U.S. world colonial empire.
    The people of Southeast Asian countries value their independence and sovereignty and demand the maintenance of international peace. The vast majority of people in this region can soberly consider the path they should take from these realities, and will not be deceived by the U.S.'s ghost stories about "communist aggression" or "communist subversion." The Indonesian "Patriot Newspaper" once emphasized that "the United States and other colonial countries want to rely on the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to continue plundering the rich mineral resources of Indonesia and its neighboring countries, continue to cruelly exploit the Asian people, and use their land to establish aggressive bases." The newspaper also said: "The Americans want to interfere in our internal affairs through the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Therefore, we must overthrow the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization." From their own personal experience, the Asian people deeply understand that only by establishing a peaceful environment on the basis of safeguarding the independence and sovereignty of Asian nations and guaranteeing the free rights of all nations can a bright future be opened up for the Asian people. The Asian-African Conference to be held in Bandung, Indonesia, in April vividly reflects the increasingly strong desire of the vast majority of Asian and African countries and peoples to take their destiny into their own hands and, at the same time, to cooperate with other countries in the world on an equal footing.
    There is no doubt that the unprecedentedly awakened and united Asian people firmly uphold the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence between countries; resolutely oppose the imperialists' aggression and interference in Asia under any pretext, and oppose the evil conspiracies of international war forces to plan new wars under any guise. Therefore, the Asian people resolutely oppose the Bangkok conference, which is preparing for war and interfering in the internal affairs of Asian countries.

### 在“反共”和“对付颠覆活动”的烟幕下

    在“反共”和“对付颠覆活动”的烟幕下
    冯之丹
    正在曼谷举行的东南亚侵略集团国家会议宣布了的讨论内容之一，是所谓“对付共产党颠覆活动”。据透露的消息说，会议已决定设立一个专门的委员会来负责策划这方面的措施。按着美国国务卿杜勒斯的基调，美国及其追随者的宣传机器最近特别不厌其烦地叫嚷东南亚地区“共产党颠覆活动的威胁”。
    帝国主义殖民者和战争煽动者利用“反共”的烟幕来遮掩自己进行侵略和发动战争，已经不是什么新奇的事情。希特勒、墨索里尼和东条就组织过打着“反共产国际公约”招牌的侵略轴心。现在美国侵略集团更进了一步，在“东南亚集体防务条约”中玩起所谓“防止颠覆活动”的花招，来干涉别国内政，侵犯别国主权，准备新的战争。
    美国帝国主义的惯用手法之一，就是在它自己作坏事和策划罪恶阴谋的同时，大叫大嚷地诽谤它所图谋的对方。这次也决不例外。在“防止共产党颠覆活动”的烟幕下面，隐藏着真正的大规模的颠覆活动，这种活动已成为美国外交政策的一部分，目的在于维护和建立帝国主义殖民统治。西方消息透露，杜勒斯带着一个“防止颠覆活动”的计划，出席曼谷会议。美联社二月十九日电称：曼谷会议关于“共产党颠覆活动”将制定一项“不会公布”的“计划”，内容将是“训练亚洲人员从事地下活动，并且利用宣传组织，把它们派到共产党亚洲的边缘去。”路透社二月十九日电称，曼谷会议要成立的“反颠覆委员会”“将是一种政治性的侦查机构”。一望可知，这是美国侵略集团所策划的干涉东南亚亚洲国家内政、进行颠覆活动的特务方案，是以中华人民共和国和东南亚各主权国家为其危害对象的。
    美国在亚洲各国从事罪恶的间谍破坏活动的事实，是大家知道的。美国对中华人民共和国的间谍破坏活动，尤其猖狂。许多已经破获的特务间谍组织，都同美国有关系。我国法院最近判决的唐奈等一批间谍案及潜入我广东境内的所谓“自由中国运动”的间谍案等，就是证明。美国及其帮腔者喋喋不休地捏造所谓“侵略和颠覆活动来自中国”的无耻谰言，无非是用来转移国际公众的注意，以掩盖美国侵略中国，对中国和亚洲其他国家进行罪恶活动的事实。
    美国的所谓“防止颠覆活动”，其实质就是不让亚洲人民有民主自由和民族独立，这在美国干涉印度支那局势的活动中是表现得非常清楚的。美国侵略集团把越南人民主张根据日内瓦协议，经过民主普选取得祖国统一的努力，说成是所谓“颠覆的危险”；而把美国违反日内瓦协议，干涉印度支那局势的非法行为，说成是“防止颠覆活动”。美国“展望”杂志承认，“绝大多数越南人都会投共产党的票”。伦敦“泰晤士报”也说，南越居民“觉得越盟代表着希望”。不消说，这正是美国侵略集团所谓的“颠覆的危险”。但是，越南人民拥护谁，将要投谁的票，根据日内瓦协议的规定，这完全是越南人民的自由权利。美国是日内瓦会议的参加国，它本应当承担保证印度支那各国人民获得民族统一的国际义务。但美国却践踏国际协议，一心要破坏印度支那各国的民主普选，破坏印度支那的停战，并企图在南越“建立一个类似南朝鲜的那种战争机器”。有关曼谷会议的业已透露的消息，表明了这正是美国在会议中策划的重大阴谋。
    美国在曼谷会议上策划的“防止颠覆活动”的阴谋，也针对着东南亚地区不愿意追随美国战争政策和出卖自己的民族独立主权的国家。美国一直对这些国家施加各种压力，甚至不惜采取最卑劣的手段，企图迫使它们放弃独立自主的政策而参加它的侵略军事集团。最近在印度尼西亚揭发出来的一些事实，提供了美国式颠覆阴谋的典型例子。印度尼西亚政府司法部长指责“外国分子不仅力图铲除沙斯特罗阿米佐约内阁，而且力图铲除这个共和国的独立”。“印度尼西亚新闻”也揭露，“中国国民党人和美元……正在策划”推翻印度尼西亚的现政府。为了达到这种颠覆目的，美国不仅在那里策动政治阴谋，而且直接参预武装叛乱。最近，雅加达的报纸揭发了美国支持所谓“南摩鹿加共和国”的武装叛乱的证据——一张美国印制的、印有美国将军麦克阿瑟像的“南摩鹿加共和国”邮票。此外，在印度尼西亚国家机关审讯中，叛乱分子供认，美国大使馆的飞机和美国新泽西—纽约美孚公司的飞机还曾空投武器给印尼境内的“回教国运动”的叛乱分子，资助他们不断制造暴乱，破坏印度尼西亚人民的和平生活。美国驻雅加达大使馆同印度尼西亚境内的武装叛乱集团之间有着联系。
    美国对印度尼西亚内政的粗暴干涉，清楚地说明，威胁到亚洲各国民族权利和独立主权的正是美国侵略集团。
    杜勒斯在曼谷会议上伪善地胡扯什么马尼拉条约能够“保障友好和自由国家的人民的独立、完整和福利”。这是对美国肆行干涉别国内政、破坏各国独立主权的政策的尖锐讽刺。美国侵略集团借口
  “保护”别的国家“免于共产党的侵略”，实质上是要剥夺一切国家的独立和主权，把它们变为美国的殖民地和军事基地，以服务于建立美国的世界殖民帝国的目的。
    东南亚各国人民重视自己的独立和主权，要求维护国际和平。这个地区绝大多数人民能够从这些现实中清醒地考虑到自己所应该走的道路，而不受美国关于“共产党侵略”或“共产党颠覆活动”的鬼话的欺骗。印度尼西亚“爱国者报”曾强调指出，“美国和其他殖民国家想要依靠东南亚公约组织继续掠夺印度尼西亚及其邻国的丰富的矿藏，继续残酷地剥削亚洲人民，利用他们的土地建立侵略基地”。该报还说：“美国人想通过东南亚公约组织干涉我国内政。因此要打倒东南亚公约组织。”亚洲人民从自己的切身经验中深深地懂得，只有在维护亚洲各民族的独立和主权，保障各民族的自由权利的基础上，建立和平环境，才能为亚洲人民开辟美好的前景。四月间将在印度尼西亚万隆举行的亚非会议就生动地反映了亚非绝大多数国家和人民要求把自己的命运掌握在自己的手里、同时以平等地位同世界上其他国家友好合作的日益坚强的愿望。
    毫无疑问，空前觉醒了的、团结起来了的亚洲人民，坚决拥护各国间和平共处的五项原则；坚决反对帝国主义者在任何借口下对亚洲的侵略和干涉，反对国际战争势力在任何幌子下策划新战争的罪恶阴谋。因此，亚洲人民坚决反对准备战争、干涉亚洲各国内政的曼谷会议。
