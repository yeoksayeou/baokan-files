Cherish Your Documents
Ben Fang

Many people are careless and forgetful, suffering from a nonchalant complacency. This can also be seen from the notices of lost documents published in the newspapers.

In the advertisement columns of many newspapers, there are almost daily ten, twenty, or even more announcements of "Lost documents, declared invalid." Year after year, no one has tallied how many documents have been lost. It seems that losing documents has become a "common phenomenon" in daily life.

If we look at the harsh reality of class struggle and the struggle between ourselves and the enemy, and deeply consider the dangerous consequences hidden in the phenomenon of lost documents, we cannot help but feel anxious about this "common phenomenon."

Recently, newspapers have continuously announced the cracking of counter-revolutionary special agent and spy cases, proving that those villains who betray the motherland and engage in espionage and sabotage activities are still hiding among us and are constantly being sent in by their imperialist masters. These are cunning, insidious, and clever fellows. The disguise they love to use most is a two-faced attitude in politics. Because they clearly understand that as soon as they appear publicly, the people will crush them like stepping on small insects. Therefore, they try their best to imitate the appearance of "workers," "cadres," and even "Communist Party members," paint themselves with various protective colors, and secretly carry out sinful sabotage and assassination plots to realize their master's plans.

When counter-revolutionaries disguise themselves, they make special efforts to obtain, steal, and forge documents from the Party and the government, military passports, and badges of trade unions, cooperatives, and other people's organizations. Among the evidence of the American-airdropped special agent case sentenced by the Supreme People's Court some time ago were a large number of carving knives, wood, and ink for engraving seals by special agents, as well as a forged "passport" of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Volunteers. The fact that individual counter-revolutionaries who escaped the net were able to infiltrate our ranks was also due to the function of fake "documents."

It is not difficult to understand why counter-revolutionaries try every means to obtain documents. They know that Communist Party members, government cadres, and revolutionary soldiers enjoy high prestige among the people and are loved by the people. Once they obtain such documents, it is easy to win the trust of the people and facilitate their sabotage activities.

In this regard, the careless act of losing documents is naturally very welcome to the enemy. It will not only create opportunities for the disguises, deceptions, scams, and sabotage of counter-revolutionaries, hostile class elements, and rogue swindlers, but may even open a path for the enemy to infiltrate government agencies, industrial and mining enterprises, and military strongholds. Some captured special agents and spies confessed that they would have had to painstakingly forge not-very-convincing "documents," but people who lost documents enabled them to obtain genuine documents and forge more identical documents for their accomplices; documents that should have taken a long time and complex methods to steal were sometimes easily obtained from those who lost them.

The loss of documents is often not due to any "unavoidable" "objective reasons." In fact, there are many people among us with a high degree of vigilance who can strictly protect state secrets and documents even in the most urgent and dangerous situations; many people have encountered disasters such as fires, floods, and accidents, but still preserved their documents and badges intact. However, because many Party organizations lack regular education to improve the vigilance of cadres and the masses, many people are careless, lack vigilance, and even lose their documents under normal circumstances. This is completely unacceptable.

Badges and documents are a sign to distinguish between inside and outside, and to distinguish between ourselves and the enemy. Once a document falls into the hands of the enemy, the result will be completely reversed. In order to effectively block this loophole in the future, we believe that on the one hand, we should constantly improve the work of issuing documents. For the entry and exit permits issued to staff by various agencies, enterprises, and schools, wherever conditions permit, staff cards with photos should be used as much as possible, and badges with only the names and numbers of the agencies and enterprises should be used less or not at all. Because this type of badge has many drawbacks, once lost, it can be immediately used by bad people and is not easy to detect. On the other hand, the fundamental way is to educate staff to cherish their documents. We must be good at using typical examples to educate and improve the revolutionary vigilance of staff, so that they realize the serious harm of losing documents. Those who are careless and negligent and therefore lose documents should be given strict criticism. If this behavior is consistent and has caused losses to the country and the people, they should also be given necessary disciplinary action. At present, the Party and government organizations of many agencies, groups, and enterprises have not shown the necessary strict attitude towards the phenomenon of lost badges. They neither seriously investigate and deal with the personnel who lost their badges, nor conduct serious education, at most requiring them to publish a statement in the newspaper. This attitude certainly cannot arouse the vigilance of staff, but can only make them develop complacency and laxity.

Cherishing documents and firmly blocking all gaps that can be exploited by the enemy is the sacred duty of every patriotic person. If all the people always and everywhere vigilantly watch the enemy's conspiracies, and every enterprise, every agency, and every rural area creates an environment of constant vigilance, it will be difficult for the enemy to hide on our land, and they will be exposed and punished when they first attempt to sabotage.

    爱护你的证件
    奔放
    有不少人马马虎虎、丢三忘四，害了随随便便的麻痹症。从报纸刊登的遗失证件启事里也可以看出来。
    许多报纸的广告栏里，差不多天天登出十条、二十条甚至更多的“遗失证件，声明作废”的启事。连年累月，究竟有多少证件遗失了，没有人去统计。仿佛，遗失证件成了日常生活中的“普通现象”。
    要是看一看阶级斗争和敌我斗争的严酷现实，深思遗失证件现象蕴藏着的危险后果，我们就不能不为这种“普通现象”捏着一把汗。
    最近，报纸不断公布出破获了的反革命特务间谍案件，证明那些叛卖祖国、进行间谍和破坏活动的恶棍们，还在我们中间隐藏着，并且不断地被他们的帝国主义主子派遣进来。这都是些狡猾、阴险、机巧的家伙。他们最爱用的伪装手法，就是政治上的两面态度。因为他们很清楚地了解：只要他们一公开出现，人民就会像踩小虫一样，把他们踩碎。所以，他们就竭力模仿“工人”、“干部”甚至“共产党员”的样子，涂上各种保护色，暗中进行罪恶的破坏和暗害勾当，来实现他们主子的计划。
    反革命分子在伪装自己时，特别努力于谋得、盗取和假造一张党和政府的证件，一纸军人护照，一枚职工会、合作社及其它人民团体的证章。前不久最高人民法院宣判的美国空投特务案件的罪证中，就有特务分子刻制图章用的大批刻刀、木料和笔墨，并且有伪制成的中国人民志愿军某部的“护照”。个别漏网的坚决反革命分子得以钻进我们内部，也是借助于假“证件”的功用。
    反革命分子想方设法获取证件，是不难理解的。他们知道，共产党员、政府干部、革命军人在人民群众中享有很高的威信，受到人民群众的爱戴，他们一旦获得了这种证件，就容易骗取人民的信任，便利自己的破坏活动。
    在这方面，那种粗心大意的遗失证件的行为，自然是敌人十分欢迎的。他们不但会给反革命分子、敌对阶级分子、流氓骗子的伪装、蒙混、诈骗和破坏捣乱造成机会，甚至可能给敌人打开一条钻进政府机关、工矿企业、军事要地去的道路。有些被捕获的特务间谍供述：本来要费尽心机才能假造成不大像样的“证件”，但遗失证件的人却使他们获得了地道的真证件，并可仿造出更多的一丝不差的证件来给他们的同伙；本来应该在较长的时间内用复杂的方法才能偷得的证件，有时从证件遗失者那里很容易就得到了。
    证件的遗失，往往不是由于什么“难以避免”的“客观原因”。其实，我们中间有不少具有高度警觉性的人，他们即使在最紧急、最危难的情况下，也能严密地保护国家的机密和证件；有很多人遇到了火灾、洪水、失事等灾害，但是仍然完好地保存了自己的证件和证章。可是由于不少党组织对干部和群众缺乏经常性的提高警惕的教育，不少人漫不经心，毫无警惕，甚至在平常的情况下也把证件丢掉了。这是完全不应该的。
    证章、证件是区别内外、分清敌我的一种标志。证件一旦落到敌人手里，结果就会完全颠倒过来。为了在今后有效地堵塞这个漏洞，我们认为一方面应该不断地改进制发证件的工作，各机关、企业和学校等发给工作人员的出入证，凡是有条件的，都应该尽量采用贴有像片的工作人员证，少用甚至根本不用只有机关、企业的名称和号码的证章。因为这种证章的流弊很多，一经遗失就能立即为坏人利用，不易察觉。另一方面，根本的办法还是在于教育工作人员应该十分爱护自己的证件。要善于通过一些典型的事例，来教育提高工作人员的革命警惕性，使他们认识到遗失证件的严重危害性。对于漫不经心、粗心大意因而遗失证件的人，应该给予他们严格的批评，如果这种行为是一贯的，并且已经给国家和人民造成了损失，还应给予他们必要的纪律处分。目前不少机关、团体、企业部门的党政组织，对于丢失证章现象没有表现出应有的严格态度。对丢失证章的人员既不严肃追查处理，也不认真进行教育，顶多要他们登报声明了事。这种态度当然不能唤起工作人员的警惕性，而只能使他们滋长麻痹松懈情绪。
    爱护证件，牢固地堵塞一切足以为敌人利用的空隙，是每一个爱国人民的神圣义务。如果全体人民随时随地凝神注视敌人的阴谋诡计，每个企业、每个机关、每个农村都造成经常保持高度警惕性的环境，敌人就很难躲藏在我们的土地上，在他们初次试图破坏时，就会受到揭发和惩办。
