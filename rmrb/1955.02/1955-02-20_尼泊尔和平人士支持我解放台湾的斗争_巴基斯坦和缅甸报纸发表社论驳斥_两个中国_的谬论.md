Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 18th: Jivan Ishwar Mishra, Chairman of the Birganj Branch of the All-Nepal Peace Committee, issued a statement on February 10th stating that the United States' occupation of Taiwan has exacerbated tensions in Asia and the world. He said that the Taiwan issue is an internal affair of the People's Republic of China, and pointed out that the Cairo Declaration had already recognized Taiwan as part of China.

    Mishra expressed support for the People's Republic of China's liberation of Taiwan and demanded that the United States armed forces immediately withdraw from Taiwan and the waters near Taiwan, and restore the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

    He concluded, "In every struggle against colonialism and for world peace, Nepal will always stand with its closest neighbors, India and China."

    Xinhua News Agency, February 18th: Karachi dispatch: The "Pakistan Observer" of East Pakistan published an editorial entitled "The Theory of Two Chinas," refuting the so-called "Two Chinas" fallacy. The editorial cited historical facts such as the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and Japan's formal transfer of Taiwan to China after the war, to illustrate that Taiwan is Chinese territory. The editorial said, "As early as January 1950, U.S. Secretary of State Acheson had stated that Taiwan had become Chinese territory." "It is clear that when Acheson made this statement, he never thought of any China other than China on the mainland."

    The editorial pointed out, "Now, to propose the suggestion of two Chinas in order to obtain military advantages is a violation of all solemn declarations and treaties, a denial of international law, and a way to make Taiwan a flashpoint for World War III."

    Xinhua News Agency, February 18th: Yangon dispatch: The Burmese "Rangoon Daily" published an editorial on the 7th stating that the only way to eliminate the current tension in Taiwan is to return Taiwan to China. The editorial pointed out that the Burmese government, like the Indian government, had long declared that Taiwan is Chinese territory.

    The editorial pointed out that the United States' plot to expand the war in Taiwan is detrimental to the people of Southeast Asia and the world. The editorial also criticized the British government for adopting a cunning and ambiguous attitude on the Taiwan issue in order to please the United States, attempting to obliterate the fact that Taiwan is Chinese territory.

    尼泊尔和平人士支持我解放台湾的斗争
    巴基斯坦和缅甸报纸发表社论驳斥“两个中国”的谬论
    【新华社新德里十八日电】全尼泊尔和平委员会伯甘吉分会主席吉瓦尼什瓦尔·米什拉二月十日发表声明说，美国侵占台湾加剧了亚洲和世界的紧张局势。他说，台湾问题是中华人民共和国的内政，他指出，开罗宣言已经承认台湾是中国的一部分。
    米什拉表示支持中华人民共和国解放台湾，并且要求美国武装部队立即撤出台湾和台湾附近海面以及恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的正当地位。
    他最后说，“在反对殖民主义和争取建立世界和平的每一次斗争中，尼泊尔将始终和它最亲密的邻国印度和中国站在一起。”
    【新华社十八日讯】喀喇蚩消息：东巴基斯坦的“巴基斯坦观察家报”以“两个中国的理论”为题发表社论，驳斥所谓“两个中国”的谬论。社论援引了开罗宣言、波茨坦公告和战后日本正式将台湾移交中国等历史事实，说明台湾是中国的领土。社论说：“美国国务卿艾奇逊早在一九五○年一月就已经表示台湾已变成中国的领土”。“事情很明显，艾奇逊发表这个声明时，他从未想到大陆上的中国以外的任何其他中国”。
    社论指出，“现在为了取得军事上的利益而提出两个中国的建议，这是违反一切庄严的宣言和条约，是否认国际法，是使台湾成为第三次世界大战的着火点的作法。”
    【新华社十八日讯】仰光消息：缅甸“仰光日报”七日发表社论说，消除目前台湾紧张局势的办法只能是将台湾归还中国。社论指出，缅甸同印度政府早就声明过台湾是属于中国的领土的。
    社论指出美国扩大台湾战火的阴谋，对东南亚和世界人民都是不利的。社论并且指责英国政府为了讨好美国，在台湾问题上采取狡猾和模棱两可的态度，企图抹煞台湾是中国领土的事实。
