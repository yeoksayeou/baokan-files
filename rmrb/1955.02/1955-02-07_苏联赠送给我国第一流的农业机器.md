Soviet Union gifts our country First-class agricultural machinery

Wang Yinpo, Machinery Technician of the State-Run Friendship Farm

The tens of thousands of tractors, combine harvesters, and all agricultural machinery that the Soviet government gifted to help our country establish a large-scale grain farm have arrived at Fulitun, the location of the preparatory office for the State-Run Friendship Farm. This spring, they will gallop across the grasslands north of Sandaogang in Jixian County, Heilongjiang Province, turning over 20,000 hectares of wasteland and planting seeds for the first time at the State-Run Friendship Farm.

The agricultural machinery that the Soviet government has given to our country this time are all the latest products of 1954. They are convenient to use, highly efficient, and suitable for the soil and climate conditions in northern Heilongjiang Province, Northeast China.

In the northern region of Heilongjiang, China, rainfall is concentrated, with more than one-third of the annual rainfall occurring in late July to mid-August. As a result, wheat harvesting is often greatly affected each year. The agricultural machinery given to us by the Soviet Union is particularly suitable for use in this area. For example, the "Stalin-6" combine harvester is equipped with electric lighting in the harvesting platform, engine, threshing sections, feeding sections, etc., to reduce the loss of harvested grain and facilitate night harvesting. In addition, it also has equipment to prevent grass entanglement. The "Stalin-4" combine harvester also has an anti-sinking device, which can be used for harvesting on wetter land, reducing pressure by nearly 60 percent. The five-bottom plow is a reinforced plow after improvements. The distance between each plowshare has been increased compared to before, avoiding soil build-up, and is especially suitable for reclaiming wasteland. In addition, there are grain collectors and grain tippers that we have not used before. The grain collector is used to collect crops that have fallen on the ground after harvesting. The grain tipper is used for loading vehicles or transferring grain in the drying yard and granary. There are also the plowless plows and star-shaped soil compactors used in the Maltsev tillage method, which are the latest inventions of the Soviet Union. It can be seen that these agricultural machinery were rarely seen even in the Soviet Union before, and the Soviet elder brother has disseminated their latest inventions and technologies to our country so promptly.

There are even more improvements in power machinery. The "Stalin-80" tractor and the "DT-54" tractor have lengthened intake extension pipes to reduce wear on the engine parts and prolong service life. The "DT-54" tractor also has an hour meter added. The Belorussian is the latest type of cultivator produced in the Soviet Union. It can tow suspended or semi-suspended agricultural implements. The lifting and lowering of the implements are controlled by a hydraulic operating device, which does not require agricultural implement operators, and the tractor driver can control it alone. It is equipped with tires with adjustable width and can travel at a speed of 12.2 kilometers per hour.

The mechanical equipment of power stations and repair shops is also new. The generator is equipped with a clutch. When lighting is not needed during the day, moving the clutch can stop the generator from rotating, which can prolong the service life of the generator. The repair shop has the most sophisticated machine tools and instruments, which can not only solve medium and major repairs and restore the horsepower of the tractor, but also make a tractor a new tractor after repair before leaving the factory. In addition, there is a mobile engineering repair vehicle, which can go to the field at any time to troubleshoot general failures of the tractor. The transport truck is equipped with an automatically lifting and lowering carriage. When unloading, the truck driver can move the lever to unload the goods, which improves labor efficiency. The cab of the GAZ-51 truck is equipped with heating, and the sofa seat has very soft springs, which can reduce the fatigue of the driver during long-term transportation. The fuel supply of the mechanical farm used to be a big problem. The Soviet Union gave a sufficient number of vehicles with special equipment for oil transportation, which have a large load capacity, short loading and unloading time, and are mechanically operated. This not only reduces the labor for loading and unloading, but also ensures the timeliness of oil supply.

The equipment for production management is even newer and more modern. In addition to having a telephone with 100 numbers, with wired telephones leading to each unit and even each production team, there are also 12 two-way radios. For working sections far away from the locations with wired telephones, radio telephones can be carried to report work to the General Dispatch Office of the General Farm at any time in the field, and to solve problems occurring in the work at any time. Through wired and wireless telephones, the General Farm Headquarters can quickly and timely transmit its production instructions to each production unit. All of this once again vividly demonstrates the unparalleled deep friendship of the Soviet people towards the people of our country. All the staff of our Friendship Farm are sincerely grateful to the Soviet government and people. We are determined to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union diligently under the guidance of Soviet experts, and to manage this State-Run Friendship Farm, which symbolizes Sino-Soviet friendship, well.

    苏联赠送给我国第一流的农业机器
    国营友谊农场机务技师　王荫坡
    苏联政府为帮助我国建立大型谷物农场而赠送的数万架拖拉机、联合收割机和全部农业机器，运到了国营友谊农场筹备处所在地——福利屯。今年春天，它们将驰骋在黑龙江省集贤县三道岗以北地区的草原上，把国营友谊农场的两万公顷荒地翻转过来，并第一次播种下种籽。
    苏联政府这次送给我国的农业机器，都是一九五四年的最新产品，使用方便，效率很高，并且符合我国东北黑龙江省北部地区的土壤气候情况。
    在我国黑龙江北部地区，雨量集中，每年三分之一以上的雨量降在七月末至八月上、中旬，因此，每年收割小麦常受到很大影响。苏联送给我们的农业机器，特别适合于这个地区的使用。例如“斯大林—六”联合收割机，为了减少收获谷物的损失，便于进行夜间抢割，在收割台、引擎、脱谷各部分、喂入部分等，都装设了电气照明。另外，它还增添了防缠草套的设备。“斯大林—四”联合收割机还附加了防陷装置，这样就能在较湿的土地上进行收割，可减少压力近百分之六十。五铧犁是经过改进后的加固犁。每个犁铧间的距离比以前增加了，避免拖堆，特别适合开垦荒地。此外，还有我们过去还未曾用过的谷物收集器，倒粮机。谷物收集器是在作物收割后，用它把丢落在地面上的作物搜集起来。倒粮机是用于晒粮场和粮库装车或倒仓之用。还有苏联最新发明的马尔采夫耕作法用的无犁壁犁和花形镇土器，这两种农业机械，可见以前在苏联也是很少的，苏联老大哥把他们的最新的发明和技术这样及时地传播给我国了。
    在动力机械方面改进的地方更多。“斯大林—八十”拖拉机和“德特—五十四”型拖拉机为了减少引擎各部分磨损，延长使用寿命，都加长了吸气延长管。“德特—五十四”型拖拉机还增添了计时针。别洛露西是苏联最新出品的一种中耕机，可牵引悬挂式或半悬挂式农具，农具的起落专有油压操纵装置，不用农具手，拖拉机司机一人即可掌握。它配有宽窄可以调整的轮胎，速度快，每小时可行十二·二公里。
    发电站和修理厂的机械设备也是新式的。发电机装设离合器，白天不用照明时，搬动离合器可以停止发电机回转，这样可以延长发电机的使用寿命。修理厂具有最精密的各种机床和仪器，不但可解决中、大修和恢复拖拉机的马力，还可以使一架拖拉机经修理后变为一个新拖拉机出厂，此外还有流动工程修理车，可以随时去田间排除拖拉机临时发生的一般故障。运输汽车装有自动起落的车箱，卸货时汽车司机搬动杠杆，就可以卸下货物，提高了劳动效率。格斯五一式汽车的驾驶室内设有暖气，沙发座有很软的弹簧，可使司机减少长时间运输的疲劳。机械农场的燃料供应，曾是一个很大的问题，苏联赠送了足够数量的具有油料运输专门设备的汽车，载重量大，装卸时间短，并用机械操纵。不但减少装卸用的劳力，还保证了油料供应的及时。
    生产管理方面的设备更是新型的和近代化的。除具有装备一百个号码的电话机，有着通往各个单位，直到每个生产队的有线电话外，还有十二部收发两用的无线电话，距离设有线电话的地点较远的作业地段，可携带无线电话，在田间随时向总场部总调度处汇报工作，随时解决工作中发生的问题。通过有线、无线电话，总场部可以把自己的生产指示迅速、及时地传达到每个生产单位。这一切，再一次生动地表明了苏联人民对我国人民的友谊是无比深厚。我们友谊农场全体职工对苏联政府与人民的衷心感激。我们决心在苏联专家的指导下，勤勤恳恳地学习苏联先进经验，把这个象征着中苏友谊的国营友谊农场办好。
