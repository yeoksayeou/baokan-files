Local state-owned and joint state-private Chinese medicine factories in areas like Rehe, Shenyang, and Beijing are now manufacturing nationally renowned traditional Chinese medicine preparations. These preparations are selected from prescriptions for pills, powders, plasters, elixirs, and medicinal wines, which have the broadest supply range and the greatest demand. They consolidate the wisdom of experienced traditional Chinese medicine doctors from more than twenty cities across the country, and the medication habits of Chinese medicine shops. From thousands of prescriptions for prepared medicines, more than fifty types with a wide range of applications, high efficacy, and the greatest popularity among the masses were finally approved. Among them are Tiger Bone Medicinal Wine for the treatment of rheumatic joint pain, "Xiang Lian Wan" for the treatment of dysentery, "Nü Jin Dan" for gynecology, "Bao Chi Wan Ying San" for pediatrics, as well as commonly used Rendan, Liu Shen Wan, and Qi Li San.

Last October, the Pharmaceutical Industry Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Light Industry sent a working group to Rehe, Harbin, Shenyang and other places to investigate and study the problems existing in the production, sales and supply of traditional Chinese medicine. Afterwards, it strengthened its guidance to local Chinese medicine factories, and newly organized several local state-owned factories to start producing famous traditional Chinese medicine preparations. Among them, Songjiang Pharmaceutical Factory began trial production from November last year and is now in production. Dalian Pharmaceutical Factory produced eleven types by the end of last year, and has increased to more than thirty types this year.

Currently, the varieties and quantities produced by these pharmaceutical factories often fall short of demand.

    各地大量制造中药成药
    热河、沈阳、北京等地目前已有七个地方国营和公私合营中药厂，制造全国闻名的中药成药。这些成药是从供应面最广、需要量最多的丸、散、膏、丹、药酒等几种药剂的处方中挑选出来的。它集中了国内二十多个城市有经验的中医师的智慧，和中药铺的用药习惯，从成千上万个成药处方中，最后审定了五十多种应用范围广、疗效高、最受广大人民群众欢迎的成药。其中有治疗风湿关节痛的虎骨药酒、治疗痢疾的“香连丸”、妇科药“女金丹”、儿科药“保赤万应散”以及常用的仁丹、六神丸、七厘散等。
    去年十月间，轻工业部医药工业管理局曾派工作组去热河、哈尔滨、沈阳等地进行调查，并研究中药在产销和供应方面存在的问题，以后就加强了对当地中药厂的指导，又新组织了几个地方国营厂开始生产有名的中药成药。其中松江药厂从去年十一月起就开始试制，现已生产。大连药厂去年年底就生产了十一种，今年起已增加到三十多种。
    目前，这些药厂所生产的品种、数量常常发生供不应求的现象。
