    Learning from the Soviet Union's Advanced Experiences in Saving Timber
    Yao Kaiyuan
    During the opening of the Soviet Union's Economic and Cultural Achievements Exhibition, I visited each exhibition hall with great interest. Now, I will write down some of the things I learned at the exhibition, combined with my own work.
    East of the main entrance of the Soviet Union's Economic and Cultural Achievements Exhibition, in the aisle between the Publications and Vocational Education Hall, there are some wood sections of papermaking raw materials, fir wood, and various plywood, wooden pipes made of plywood, and wood fiber pressed products. On the wall are several photos of forest growth, logging, and timber transportation. From these exhibits, we can not only see how developed the Soviet Union's forest industry and timber industry are, but also how much the Soviet Union values the economical use of wood.
    The forest area of the Soviet Union is about 1.1 billion hectares, accounting for 41% of the total land area; the forest stock is about 60 billion cubic meters, and the current annual logging volume is about 300 to 400 million cubic meters. Assuming the annual growth rate is 1%, the annual growth is 600 million cubic meters of timber, which, after deducting the logging volume, leaves more than 200 million cubic meters per year. Although the Soviet Union has such vast forest resources, and although the amount of timber logged each year is so large, it still attaches great importance to the full utilization and conservation of timber.
      The widespread application of plywood is a feature of the above exhibits and also a way to save timber. The plywood exhibits are labeled with decorative plywood, wood veneer, oak inlaid plywood, and plywood made of pine, birch, linden, etc., as well as blockboard, plywood pipes, and so on. Among them, blockboard is made of two layers of plywood on both sides, with small square wood pieces filled in the middle. According to the specifications, its thickness ranges from 16 mm (about half a Chinese inch) to 50 mm (about one and a half Chinese inches) in nine types, and the length and width also have three different specifications as needed. All the sawn-off edge boards, end wood, edge wood with rotten and hollow cores, and even thicker branches, as long as they are five or six millimeters thick and long enough, can be used to manufacture this type of wood board. This clearly shows the breadth of the Soviet Union's economical use of wood.
    In addition, there is also a kind of wood fiber pressed product, which further illustrates the extent to which the Soviet Union has fully utilized wood. At first glance, one doesn't know what this black product is made of; after careful observation, it can be seen that it is pressed from many wood chips of different sizes like matchsticks, plus other chemical substances. The explanatory sign reads: Wood fiber pressed products are used to manufacture bushings of various diameters for bearings and in machine manufacturing and metallurgical industries. It is a substitute for bronze, tin alloys, and rubber cloth. This is a step further than the blockboard mentioned earlier: even wood chips and sawdust and other "waste" can be used to press into very important industrial products, and can replace copper and tin alloys, becoming an indispensable substitute for bushings in machine manufacturing. It can simply be said that there is no part of the wood that cannot be used!
    The wooden pipes rolled from plywood are of standard lengths of five to seven meters. Probably for ease of transportation, the exhibits there are pipes of one and a half meters long and long tubes of five or six sections glued together. The inner diameter of the pipes ranges from 100 to 300 mm in six types, and the wall thickness also ranges from 5 to 13 mm in five types. Because the inner diameter and thickness of the pipes are different, the weight per meter is also different, ranging from two kilograms to ten kilograms. I think the pressure resistance of this kind of wooden pipe must be very strong. If preservatives are added, the scope of application may be wider. I speculate that in some temporary buildings where pipes with low pressure are needed, using this kind of pipe instead will be light, durable, and greatly reduce transportation force.
    The several sets of furniture displayed in the exhibition hall, and many facilities in the dormitories, living rooms, and dining rooms of university students and graduate students, all widely used plywood materials. Those furniture and equipment presented the special patterns of broad-leaved wood, the bird's-eye maple wood grain, the hazelnut cloud grain... These things were manufactured exquisitely and practically, polished and painted, with moving colors, beautiful and pleasing to the eye.
    The Soviet people cherish forest resources very much, and their spirit of saving every inch of wood in terms of timber use is a profound revelation and education for us, isn't it? Let's look back at our own situation.
    According to estimates from the forestry department, China's forest area accounts for only 5% of the country's land area, about one-seventeenth of the Soviet Union's, and the forest stock is only a few billion cubic meters, one-fifteenth of the Soviet Union's. Moreover, many of China's forests grow in places where transportation is very inconvenient, and they cannot be utilized for the time being. Therefore, the supply of timber appears increasingly tight and difficult compared to the needs of the country's economic construction. To solve this contradiction, on the one hand, we must actively develop new forest areas so that long-stored timber can be utilized as soon as possible; on the other hand, we must accelerate afforestation in conditional areas across the country so that a certain amount of timber can be harvested annually within 20 to 30 years to meet construction needs. In addition to this, there is another very important task that has been neglected by people, and that is the issue of timber conservation.
    It must be admitted that there is still a serious waste of timber in our logging and utilization. In newly logged forest areas, good materials are selected for logging, leaving behind diseased and rotten wood, crooked wood, and birch and poplar trees, which are considered to have little economic value. After logging, treetops, branch materials, and out-of-grade materials are all over the forest, which not only deteriorates the environment for forest regeneration, but also greatly reduces timber production, causing these timbers left in the forest to fall into death and decay. These account for at least 20% to 30% of the logging volume.
    When a large amount of timber arrives at timber mills or timber-using departments, they have to saw off tens of thousands of cubic meters of edge material and wood ends. Many timber-using departments simply use a bourgeois young master's attitude to pick and choose timber. Regardless of the project or the appliance, they all select good tree species (red pine), good material (thick at both ends), and good material (square and upright), and all require the use of neat, straight, and flawless timber. They don't ask what the actual needs are, but always think, isn't good material always stronger and more beautiful than second-rate material? Isn't long always better than short? Isn't it simple to saw off a section if it can't be used? Such examples of timber waste can be seen at construction sites and in mining areas. Soviet experts were surprised to see that some places in our country also used red pine wood to build toilets, but many of us are used to it!
    Each of us should fight against all phenomena of timber waste with the attitude of being masters who cherish state property. First of all, forestry departments must cherish national forest resources. When logging, they must try to harvest tree species in the forest that are so-called "unsuitable materials" as well as some trees with minor diseases. The treetop wood that can be used for smaller purposes, or thicker branch materials, should be transported out as much as possible. Timber-using departments should carefully calculate and propose requirements for timber according to the actual situation to avoid the unreasonable phenomenon of using large materials for small purposes and using superior materials for inferior purposes. Construction units must also seriously consider the economical use of wood materials such as scaffolding and formwork, and try to reduce the phenomenon of sawing long materials short and sawing large materials small.
    Plywood and blockboard are effective methods of fully utilizing wood. Timber mills should consider manufacturing more, especially to improve product quality, such as avoiding warpage, reducing knots, and paying attention to the beauty of the grain, degumming, cracking, and other phenomena. As long as these materials are manufactured to be durable, beautiful, and inexpensive, they will surely be welcomed by the masses.
    From the few timber exhibits displayed at the Soviet Union's Economic and Cultural Achievements Exhibition, we have seen the correct direction for saving timber. Let us all work towards this direction!

    学习苏联节约木材的先进经验
    姚开元
    在苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会开幕期间，我曾怀着极大的兴趣参观了各个展览馆。现在，我把在展览会中结合自己的业务学到的一点东西写在这里。
    在苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会的正门东面，到出版物和职业教育馆的过道中间，陈列着一些造纸原料的木段、枞木，以及各种三合板、用三合板制造的木管、木纤维的压制品，墙上挂着几幅林木生长、伐木运材的照片。在这里还有一张苏联的森林分布图。从这些展品中，我们不仅可以看到苏联的森林工业和制材工业是多么发达，而且还可以看到苏联是多么重视节约使用木材。
    苏联的森林面积约为十一亿公顷，占国土总面积的百分之四十一；森林蓄积量约有六百亿立方公尺，现在每年的采伐量大约为三亿至四亿立方公尺。假定年生长量为百分之一的话，每年生长六亿立方公尺木材，抵上采伐量外，每年还可余下二亿多立方公尺。苏联虽有面积这样广大的森林资源，虽然每年所采伐的木材是这样地多，可是，却非常重视充分利用和节约木材。
      广泛地应用三合板，是上述展品中的一个特点，也是节约使用木材的办法。三合板陈列品的种类标明有装饰用三合板、木质层板、橡木镶嵌三合板，有松木、桦木、菩提树等三合板，有细木板、三合板制管子等等。其中如细木板，是两面用二层三合板，中间用细小的方形木材填充夹制而成的。按照说明的规格，它的厚度有从十六公厘（约半市寸）到五○公厘（约一市寸半）等九种，长与宽也按需要有三种不同的规格。凡是锯下来的边板皮、梢头木、中间病腐空心的边材、甚至比较粗的树枝，只要有五六公厘粗和足够的长度，都可以利用来制造这类木板之用。这就可以清楚地看出苏联节约使用木材的广泛了。
    另外，还有一种木纤维压制品，更说明苏联充分利用木材已达到何等精细的程度了。粗看起来，这种黑黑的制品不知是什么东西做的；经过细致的观察以后，才看出里面是用许多像火柴杆那样大小不同的木屑碎块，加上其他化学物品压制出来的。说明牌上这样写着：木纤维压制品供制造轴承及机器制造业和冶金工业等方面各种直径的轴套用，它是青铜、锡合金和胶布的代用品。这比较前面所说的细木板是更进一步了：连碎木块、锯木屑之类的“废料”也可用来压制成很重要的工业用品，并且可以代替铜、锡合金，成为机器制造业方面不可少的轴套代用品，这就简直可以说，所有的木材没有不能利用的部分！
    用三合板卷成的木管子，标准长度是五至七公尺，大约为了运输的方便，那里陈列的是长为一公尺半的管子和用胶接合起来的五六节的长筒。管子的内径有从一百至三百公厘等六种，管子壁的厚度也有五至十三公厘等五种。因为管子内径和厚度不同，每公尺的重量也就不同，自二公斤以至十公斤的都有。我想这种木管子的耐压力一定很强，如果加上防腐剂，应用的范围可能更广。我这样推想，在一些临时性的建筑上需要使用压力不大的管子，大概利用这种管子来代替，既轻便耐用，又可以减少很大的运输力。
    展览馆里陈列的几套家具，大学生和研究生的宿舍、客室、餐室的许多设备，都是广泛地利用了三合板材料。那些家具和设备呈现着阔叶树木材的特种花纹、槭树的鸟眼木理、榛木的云纹木理……这些东西制造得精巧而实用，磨光髹漆，色彩动人，美丽悦目。
    苏联人民十分珍惜森林资源，在用材方面寸木不弃的节约精神，难道对于我们不是一个深刻的启示和教育吗？回头来看看我们自己的情形吧。
    根据林业部门调查估计，我国的森林面积不过占国土面积的百分之五，约为苏联的十七分之一，森林蓄积量不过几十亿立方公尺，为苏联的十五分之一。而且我国还有很多森林生长在运输很不方便的地方，一时还利用不上。因此，木材供应跟国家的经济建设的需要比起来就显得日益紧迫和困难。要解决这个矛盾，当然一方面必须积极开发新林区，使久藏的林木能尽早被利用；另方面更必须在全国范围内的有条件的地方加速造林，以便在二三十年内，每年能采伐一定数量的木材供建设需要。除这以外，还有一件非常重要的工作却被人们忽视了，这就是节约木材的问题。
    必须承认，我们在采伐和利用木材上，还存在着严重的浪费现象。在新采伐的林区里，选择好材采伐，留下了病腐木、弯曲木和桦杨等所谓经济价值不大的林木；采伐以后，梢头木、枝条材、等外材满布林内，既恶化了林木再生长的环境，更大大减低了木材的产量，使这些留在林内的林木，只有陷于死亡腐烂。这些至少要占采伐量的百分之二三十。
    大量木材到了制材厂或用材部门，那里又得锯下数以万立方公尺计的边皮材、木头头。许多用材部门简直是以资产阶级阔少爷的态度来挑剔木材，不管什么工程，什么器具，都一律要挑选好树种
  （红松）、好材（两头一齐粗）、好料（方方正正的），一律要求使用整齐，不弯曲，没有瑕疵的木材。他们不去问实际需要怎样，总是认为，好材不是总比次材结实美观吗？长的不是总比短的好些吗？用不了锯掉一节不是很简单吗？这类浪费木材的例子，在建筑工地和矿区都可看到。苏联专家看见我们有的地方盖厕所也用红松木感到惊奇，但是我们许多人却习以为常！
    我们每个人都应当以爱护国家财产的主人翁态度，同一切浪费木材的现象作斗争。首先，森林工业部门要珍惜国家森林资源，在采伐的时候，一定要把森林里所谓“不成材”的树种以及一些稍有病害的林木尽量采伐，可以作较小用途的梢头木，或比较粗的枝条材要尽量运输出来。用材部门应该精打细算，按实际情况提出对木材的要求，以避免大材小用、优材劣用的不合理现象。建筑单位也必须认真考虑脚手架、模板等木料的节约使用，尽量减少长材锯短、大材锯小的现象。
    三合板、细木板是充分利用木材能力的方法，制材部门应考虑更多地制造，尤其要提高产品质量，如避免挠曲，减少疤节，注意纹理美观、脱胶开裂等等现象。这类材料只要制造得耐用美观，价格低廉，就一定会受到广大群众的欢迎。
    我们从苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会里所陈列的少数木材展品中，看到了节约木材的正确方向，让我们大家都朝着这个方向努力吧！
