Xinhua News Agency, February 17th: PLA units stationed in Beijing are enthusiastically launching a signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons.

　　On the 17th, commanders and soldiers from various branches of the armed forces, including the Air Force, Navy, Armored Corps, Public Security Forces, and Anti-Aircraft Forces, held signature rallies. "As long as the imperialists launch a war of aggression, we and the people of the world must wipe them off the face of the earth!" This was a slogan posted at a signature rally by soldiers guarding Tiananmen Square, marking the firm will of our army soldiers to defend peace and oppose the use of atomic weapons.

　　Many soldiers, such as Ma Baoyuan and Zhao Dejin, who were performing night guard duties, came out to sign as soon as they returned to their dormitories in the daytime. Xue Baoren, a recipient of the Second Class Merit Citation, said when signing: "We must resolutely defend peace, oppose aggression, and oppose the use of atomic weapons. The United States uses atomic bombs to scare the people of the world, but the Soviet Union's hydrogen weapons have already gained the upper hand. The American atomic bomb will never scare us Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army."

　　More than 90 percent of the commanders and soldiers of the naval units stationed in Beijing signed on the first day. All the commanders and soldiers of a certain armored unit signed the "Open Letter to the People of the World." On the afternoon of the 16th, tank crew members who were intensifying their training immediately signed enthusiastically at the meeting after listening to the report by physicist Qian Sanqiang "On Opposing the Use of Atomic Weapons." On the morning of the 17th, a large group of tank crew members gathered again at the tank training ground to sign. Commanders and fighters of the Second Class Merit Company and tank crew members who won honorary titles in training also solemnly signed their names. Sun Fafa, a tank crew member who has been awarded the title of meritorious soldier three times, said when signing: "Our signing is to show our will and determination to defend peace, and to show that we resolutely oppose the use of atomic weapons. But even if imperialism uses atomic weapons to launch a war of aggression, it will never be able to save itself from failure."

　　Air Force units also held signature rallies. Soldiers of a certain company stationed in Beijing under the North China Military Region held a signature rally immediately after their military lesson. Ji Youlin, a soldier of a certain anti-aircraft artillery unit and recipient of the Third Class Merit Citation, said: "Atomic weapons cannot scare the peace-loving people. We will resolutely defend the motherland and defend peace with practical actions, and we will fight to the end for the liberation of Taiwan and the coastal islands!"

    解放军驻京部队签名反对使用原子武器
    【新华社十七日讯】中国人民解放军驻京机关、部队热烈展开反对使用原子武器的签名运动。
    十七日，空军、海军、装甲兵、公安部队、防空部队等各兵种部队的指挥员、战斗员，纷纷举行了签名集会。“只要帝国主义发动侵略战争，我们和全世界人民就一定要将它们从地球上消灭干净！”这是守卫天安门的战士们在签名集会上张贴的一幅标语，它标志着我军战士保卫和平、反对使用原子武器的坚强意志。
    执行夜间警卫任务的马宝元、赵德金等许多战士，白天才回到宿舍就跑出来签了名。二等功臣薛宝仁在签名时说：“我们要坚决保卫和平，反对侵略，反对使用原子武器。美国用原子弹来吓唬世界人民，但苏联的氢武器已经占了优势。美国的原子弹是决吓不倒我们中国人民和人民解放军的。”
    驻京的海军部队的指挥员和战斗员，在第一天中就有百分之九十以上签了名。装甲部队某部全体指挥员战斗员都在“告全世界人民书”上签了名。十六日下午，正在加紧锻炼本领的坦克手们，听了物理学家钱三强“关于反对使用原子武器”的报告后，便立即在会上热烈地签了名。十七日上午，在坦克车场上，又聚集了一大群签名的坦克手。战斗二等功臣连的指战员和在练兵中获得荣誉称号的坦克手们，也都郑重地签了名。曾经三次获得功臣称号的坦克手孙发发在签名时说：“我们签名，是表明我们保卫和平的意志和决心，是表明我们坚决反对使用原子武器。但帝国主义就是用原子武器发动侵略战争，也决不能挽救它的失败。”
    空军部队也集会签名。华北军区驻京某连队的战士们刚下军事课就举行签名集会。某高射炮部队战士、三等功臣吉有林说：“原子武器吓不倒爱好和平的人民，我们决以实际行动保卫祖国，保卫和平，并要为解放台湾和沿海岛屿奋斗到底！”
