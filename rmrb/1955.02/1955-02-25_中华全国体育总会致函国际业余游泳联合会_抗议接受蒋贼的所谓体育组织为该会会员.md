Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd: The All-China Sports Federation sent a letter to the International Amateur Swimming Federation on February 23rd, protesting the Executive Committee's acceptance of the so-called sports organization of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique as a member.

The All-China Sports Federation, which is already a member of the International Amateur Swimming Federation, emphasized in the protest letter that the All-China Sports Federation is the only legitimate national amateur sports organization in China, and only this organization can represent the Chinese people in the International Amateur Swimming Federation. The Executive Committee of the International Amateur Swimming Federation's approval of the illegal so-called sports organization of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which has long been spurned by the Chinese people, as a member is extremely unreasonable. It not only damages the reputation of the International Amateur Swimming Federation, but also is not conducive to friendly cooperation between the people of various countries. The All-China Sports Federation solemnly declares: It absolutely does not allow the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to join the International Amateur Swimming Federation under any name, and resolutely demands that the Executive Committee revoke this extremely unreasonable resolution.

    中华全国体育总会致函国际业余游泳联合会
    抗议接受蒋贼的所谓体育组织为该会会员
    【新华社二十三日讯】中华全国体育总会在二月二十三日致函国际业余游泳联合会，抗议该会执行委员会接受蒋介石卖国集团的所谓体育组织为会员。
    早就是国际业余游泳联合会会员的中华全国体育总会在抗议信中强调指出，中华全国体育总会是中国唯一合法的全国性的业余体育组织，只有这个组织能够代表中国人民参加国际业余游泳联合会。国际业余游泳联合会执行委员会批准早已为中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石卖国集团的非法的所谓体育组织为会员，是极不合理的，它不仅有损国际业余游泳联合会的信誉，而且也不利于各国人民间的友好合作。中华全国体育总会郑重声明：绝对不容许蒋介石卖国集团盗用任何名义加入国际业余游泳联合会，并坚决要求该会执行委员会撤销这一项极端不合理的决议。
