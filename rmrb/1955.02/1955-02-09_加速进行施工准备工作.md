Jilin Province's key projects are accelerating various construction preparations, striving to start construction as soon as possible. According to preliminary statistics, the province's investment in key projects this year increased by 27.13 percent compared to 1954. Among them, newly built projects include a large number of earthwork, concrete, and steel-reinforced concrete structure factory buildings. Continuing construction projects have a large number of installation tasks.

Generally, key construction units have already compiled construction organization designs. They have also established affiliated enterprise processing plants according to project needs and equipment conditions, determined the proportion of factory and mechanized construction, and rectified the management of mechanized supply stations and affiliated enterprises.

Design materials and construction drawings for key projects throughout the province are arriving one after another. Some units have received all of them and are working intensively on translation and reproduction.

For the large quantities of materials used in construction this year, most have signed contracts and some are being shipped to the site one after another, except for special materials used by individual units that have not yet found a source.

All key project units have adapted to the characteristics and needs of this year's engineering tasks, adjusted organizational structures on the original basis, reduced levels, strengthened grassroots work, and implemented the principles of regional management and the "one-chief system."

    加速进行施工准备工作
    吉林省各重点工程正加速进行各项施工准备工作，争取早日开工。据初步统计，今年全省重点工程投资额比一九五四年增加百分之二十七点一三，其中新建工程，有大量土方、混凝土、钢骨铁筋结构的厂房建筑；继续进行建设的工程，有大量的安装任务。
    各重点建设单位，一般都已编制了施工组织设计。并根据工程需要和设备情况建立了附属企业加工厂，确定工厂化和机械化的施工比重，整顿了机械化供应站和附属企业的管理。
    全省各重点工程的设计资料施工图纸正在陆续到达，有的单位已全部到齐，正在紧张地翻译复制。
    今年施工用的大批材料，除个别单位用的特殊材料尚未找到货源，大部分都签订了合同，并有的正在陆续运入现场。
    各重点工程单位都适应今年工程任务的特点和需要，在原有的基础上调整了组织机构，减少了层次，加强了基层工作，贯彻了区域管理制和一长制的原则。
