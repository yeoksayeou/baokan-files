A Shocking Atrocity

On the night of February 14th, a small group of armed thugs attacked the Embassy of the Romanian People's Republic in Bern, the capital of Switzerland. This group of thugs broke into the Romanian Embassy, shot and killed the embassy driver, and then rushed indoors, imprisoning the Romanian embassy staff and occupying the embassy for two days. This is an extremely outrageous incident in the international community in recent years.

Diplomatic envoys and their premises have the sacred and inviolable rights and should be protected by the host country. This is a universally recognized principle of international law regarding diplomatic privileges. The Romanian Embassy should have been protected by the Swiss authorities, but such a shocking incident occurred. After the incident, despite repeated urgings from the Romanian Embassy, the Swiss authorities did not take effective measures to promptly arrest these thugs and quickly restore the diplomatic privileges of the Romanian Embassy. The Swiss authorities and Swiss police were on the scene, but allowed these armed thugs to openly occupy the embassy for more than forty hours, allowing these thugs to do whatever they wanted at their leisure. This cannot but be shocking. The Swiss government clearly bears an unshirkable responsibility for this serious incident. People will pay close attention to how the Swiss government punishes these thugs and guarantees the privileges of diplomatic envoys in order to maintain normal international relations.

It must be particularly pointed out that this group of armed thugs was fostered and organized by the U.S. intelligence agencies. They set up a special organization in Switzerland, and under the direction of the U.S. intelligence agencies, carried out this brutal provocation. The goal of the U.S. warmongers is clearly to further aggravate the tense situation in Europe through a series of provocative incidents. This cannot but arouse the vigilance of all peace-loving people of all countries, especially the Swiss people.

### 一件骇人听闻的暴行

    一件骇人听闻的暴行
    二月十四日夜晚，一小群武装暴徒袭击了在瑞士首都伯尔尼的罗马尼亚人民共和国公使馆。这群暴徒侵入了罗马尼亚公使馆内，枪杀了使馆司机，并且冲入室内，关禁罗马尼亚使馆人员，占据使馆达两日之久。这是近年来国际社会中一件极端令人愤慨的事件。
    外交使节及其馆址具有神圣不可侵犯的权利和应该受到驻在国的保护，这是举世公认的关于外交特权的国际法原则。罗马尼亚公使馆应该受到瑞士当局的保护，但却竟然发生如此骇人听闻的事件。事件发生后，瑞士当局不顾罗马尼亚公使馆的一再督促，未曾采取有效的措施及时逮捕这些暴徒，迅速恢复罗马尼亚使馆的外交特权。瑞士当局和瑞士警察虽然就在现场，却放任这些武装暴徒公然占据使馆达四十余小时之久，使这些暴徒们得以从容不迫地为所欲为，这不能不令人感到震惊。瑞士政府对这个严重事件显然负有不容推诿的责任。人们将密切注意瑞士政府如何惩处这些暴徒、保障外交使节的特权，以维护正常的国际关系。
    不能不特别指出，这批武装暴徒是由美国特务机关所豢养和组织的，他们在瑞士设立了专门的组织，在美国特务机关的指使下，进行了这一横暴的挑衅。美国的好战分子的目的显然是想通过一连串的挑衅事件使紧张的欧洲局势更加恶化。这不能不引起一切爱好和平的各国人民尤其是瑞士人民的警惕。
