Most of the machinery and equipment that the Soviet government gifted to China for the establishment of a large-scale grain farm has been transported to the state-owned Friendship Farm. According to statistics up to the 2nd, 90 percent of all tractors and agricultural machinery have arrived in Fulitun. The remaining 10 percent of agricultural machinery and some equipment for the farm repair shop, as well as 20 camping cars, 5 sleeping cars, and a motorcycle, are en route and will arrive soon.

The machinery and equipment gifted to China by the Soviet Union includes: 98 tractors of various types, 100 grain combines, 128 powered plows, 120 powered grain sowing machines, and various other machines. Currently, these machines have begun to be transported to the farm site in the Sandaogang area and are being installed. When the ice and snow melt and spring blossoms, they will gallop across the grasslands north of Sandaogang. (Our newspaper's telegram from Fulitun on the 4th)

    苏联赠送我国的农业机器设备大部运到友谊农场
    苏联政府送给我国建立大型谷物农场的机器和设备，已大部运到了国营友谊农场。据到二日为止的统计，在全部拖拉机和农业机械中，已有百分之九十到达了福利屯，其余百分之十的农业机械和农场修理厂的部分装备，以及二十辆宿营车、五辆卧车和一辆摩托车等，已在运输途中，不久，即可全部到达。
    苏联赠送给我国的机器和设备包括：各式拖拉机九十八台、谷物联合收割机一百台、机力犁一百二十八个、机力谷物播种机一百二十架以及其他各种机器。现在，这些机器已开始向三道岗地区农场场地运输，并进行安装工作。待冰雪融化，春暖花开的时候，它们将驰骋在三道岗以北地区的草原上。　（本报福利屯四日电）
