    Xinhua News Agency report: The capital's signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons has basically concluded. In eight days, the number of signatures reached 2,750,901.

    The signature campaign in the capital began with a vigorous momentum, unfolding universally throughout the city. On the day with the most signatures, there were more than 730,000 people signing. Almost 100% of the staff, students, teachers, and workers in various government organizations, factories, and schools signed. In the suburbs, 755,067 people signed. People from other social strata also enthusiastically signed. Monks, nuns, and Taoists from various temples and imams from various mosques held signature rallies separately.

    While signing against the use of atomic weapons, the people of the capital warmly expressed their support for the Soviet Union's policy of using atomic energy for the peaceful construction of mankind, and expressed their solidarity with the Soviet Union and peace-loving people all over the world to shatter the U.S. imperialists' sinister plot to wage an atomic war. Many scientists and scientific workers in the capital stated that they would publicize to the broad masses of people the dangers of using atomic energy for war and the benefits of using it for peaceful construction, and that they would strengthen the research work on the peaceful utilization of atomic energy. This signature campaign further strengthened the determination of the people of the capital to liberate Taiwan. Wang Cai, a furnace foreman at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, said when signing, "We must work harder to improve production, smelt more pig iron, and support the struggle to liberate Taiwan with practical actions."
