Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, February 26th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Zhejiang Front liberated the Nanjishan Islands on February 26th. With this, all enemy-occupied islands along the coast of Zhejiang Province have been completely liberated.

Before and after liberating Dachen Island, Yushan Islands, and Pishan Island on February 13th, the People's Liberation Army on the Zhejiang Front liberated Beilongshan Island in the northwest sea area of the Nanjishan Islands, Beijishan Islands in the northeast sea area, and Taishan Islands in the southwest sea area, placing the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on the Nanjishan Islands in a three-sided encirclement. Our People's Liberation Army air force squadrons also dispatched sorties in batches to strike the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on the islands, forcing the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops on the island to finally abandon the island and flee.

When the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops fled, they plundered the property of the island's residents, carried out brutal destruction, and abducted more than two thousand residents to Taiwan.

The Nanjishan Islands are located about 37 kilometers east of Pingyang County, Zhejiang Province, and about 280 kilometers south of Taiwan. They were the last stronghold of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in the Zhejiang sea area. Nanjishan Island has an area of about eight square kilometers and is the main island of the Nanjishan Islands. It is surrounded by more than ten small islands such as Daleishan, Zhuyu, Houjishan, Changyaoshan, and Xiamashan. The liberation of these islands has created even more favorable conditions for our People's Liberation Army to liberate Taiwan and the enemy-occupied islands along the coast of Fujian Province.

    浙江前线人民解放军解放南麂山列岛
   【新华社浙江前线二十六日电】浙江前线的中国人民解放军，在二月二十六日解放南麂山列岛。至此，浙江省沿海所有敌占岛屿，已告全部解放。
    浙江前线我人民解放军在二月十三日解放大陈岛、渔山列岛和披山岛的前后，解放了位于南麂山列岛西北海面的北龙山岛、东北海面的北麂山列岛和西南海面的台山列岛，使南麂山列岛上的蒋贼军陷于三面被围的困境。我人民解放军空军机群也分批出动打击了岛上的蒋贼军，迫使岛上蒋贼军终于弃岛而逃。
    蒋贼军在逃跑时劫夺了岛上居民的财物，进行了残暴的破坏，并把岛上的两千多个居民劫往台湾。
    南麂山列岛位于浙江省平阳县境以东约三十七公里的海面上，南距台湾约二百八十公里，是蒋贼军在浙江海面上的最后一个据点。南麂山岛面积约八平方公里，是南麂山列岛的主岛，它的四周有大擂山、竹屿、后麂山、常窑山、下马鞍等十多个小岛。这个列岛的解放，造成了我人民解放军解放台湾和福建省沿海敌占岛屿的更加有利的条件。
