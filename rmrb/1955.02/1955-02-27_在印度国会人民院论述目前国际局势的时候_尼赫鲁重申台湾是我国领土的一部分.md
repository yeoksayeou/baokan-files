Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 26th: According to Indian Information Service reports, Indian Prime Minister Nehru said in the Indian Parliament’s Lok Sabha on the afternoon of February 25th: "Today, the most important and most dangerous international issue in the world is the situation caused by Taiwan and the coastal islands of China."

Nehru emphasized, "One of the greatest characteristics of our time is the rise of Asia, and whether people like it or not, this is completely irrelevant; it is a fact. Unfortunately, people do not accept the facts. Here is a substantial and enormous fact, as you can imagine, and that is the existence of the People's Government of China." He went on to point out, "However, some countries do not recognize it. It is extremely bizarre that the United Nations refers to the island of Taiwan as China. Geography seems to be meaningless to the United Nations or other countries. How can any policy based on deliberately avoiding this fact be the correct policy?"

Nehru said, "Obviously, we cannot recognize two Chinas. We can only recognize one China. In fact, no one can claim that there are two Chinas, and certainly no country can recognize two Chinas. We deliberately recognized one China because it is the real China. Obviously, Taiwan is not China." Nehru said these words when referring to the speech by Indian President Prasad, who said in his speech that we recognize the People's Government of China, we do not recognize other Chinas, and China's demands are justified.

He continued, for hundreds of years, except for a period of less than half a century of Japanese occupation, Taiwan has always been a part of China. Even after the Japanese occupied Taiwan, China always considered Taiwan as belonging to itself and demanded rights over Taiwan; what kind of government existed in China at that time is completely irrelevant. This is China's national demand. In addition, it was clearly announced in Cairo and Potsdam that Taiwan should be returned to China. The Japanese surrender terms also mentioned this.

Nehru pointed out, "Therefore, there has never been any doubt about the fact that Taiwan is an integral part of the Chinese nation. So, what happened last year, two years, or three years ago to change this situation? I don't know of anything that would change this situation, except that some people are saying that someone doesn't like the current Chinese nation. There is no particular argument logically or legally. It is reasonable to conclude that things are as they are. --I can understand that even if a reasonable claim is overthrown by war or other solutions, the claim will not be cancelled--For a country that recognizes the current Chinese government, it is reasonable to conclude that Taiwan is a part of that country. Taiwan is currently in the hands of Chiang Kai-shek, who is supported by a great power."

Nehru said, "What should be done in this regard? I am not going to argue about this issue, I just want to emphasize one point. Whatever is done, people should try to negotiate and seek a peaceful resolution. This may take some time, but spending time is always better than engaging in a war that could expand and destroy a large part of the world."

Nehru then spoke about the coastal islands of China, saying, "The coastal islands, especially Jinmen and Mazu, are obviously and definitely a part of China. They are only a few miles from the coast - five miles or ten miles. No country can tolerate any enemy entrenched ten miles away from its coast and constantly bombarding them. This is an intolerable situation. Therefore, it is almost universally believed that an immediate withdrawal from these islands should take place, allowing these islands to belong to the mainland government. However, this has not yet been done. I don't know if it will be done. I would have thought this was an additional step that should be taken in any case."

While summarizing the international situation, Nehru spoke about the Geneva Conference. He pointed out that if Laos or Cambodia could be used as bases against China, then China would naturally strongly oppose it. He said that it was more or less decided in Geneva that these Indochinese countries of Laos and Cambodia should not participate in any military treaties or alliances of either side.

Nehru pointed out that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are widely circulating. Nehru emphasized, "I can assure the Lok Sabha that even if some governments have not publicly endorsed this proposition, the people of many countries are attracted to this proposition and are increasingly attracted to it."

He also said that today there are many factions in the world in terms of thought and action. One faction calls itself the "tough action" faction. This is a relic of the old days, when a small country was "misbehaving," warships or cruisers would be sent to scare it into submission. Nehru believed that tough action is completely feasible when a large country threatens a small country. "However, when the other party is equally powerful, tough action will not have much effect." There is also a faction that "talks loudly about negotiating with strength as a backing." "However, when one side develops strength to negotiate, unfortunately, the other side will also develop strength."

Nehru said, "There is turmoil in Africa. There is more than just turmoil in Asia. Things have already happened. Revolutions have broken out. The entire face of things has changed and is still changing. What is currently happening in Africa is very meaningful and very important. However, I am amazed at the way Africa has been treated. What I want to say is that perhaps due to past habits or present interests, no matter which aspect it is, some people are unable to see things as they are. We must understand the huge new forces that have emerged."
  "These forces are playing a role in the world."

Nehru spoke about the upcoming Asian-African Conference. He said: This is an official conference attended by governments of various countries, and in fact, by the prime ministers of various countries. Representatives from countries with completely different ideologies and political and economic structures will participate in this conference. He said: We have many things in common, and we also have many things that are not in common. This is an extraordinary meeting. However, the fact that we are holding a meeting is of extremely great significance. This is the first time such a thing has happened. This indeed naturally illustrates that Asia and Africa are moving to the forefront. He believed that the proposal to convene the Asian-African Conference was timely and in line with the spirit of the times.

Nehru again emphasized that this conference is of extremely great significance. He said: I hope this conference will not be held as if it is establishing a group hostile to others. This is basically an experiment in implementing coexistence. This is basically an experiment in treating Asian and African countries with this or that tendency towards national blocs, that they meet together in a friendly manner, and try to seek a common basis for cooperation in economic, cultural, or even political aspects. Therefore, this is a development of great significance - not only from the perspective of Asia, but also from the perspective of the world.

    在印度国会人民院论述目前国际局势的时候
    尼赫鲁重申台湾是我国领土的一部分
   【新华社新德里二十六日电】据印度新闻处消息：印度总理尼赫鲁二月二十五日下午在印度国会人民院说：“今天世界在国际上的最重要、最危险的问题是台湾和中国沿海岛屿所引起的局势”。
    尼赫鲁着重说，“我们时代的最大特征之一就是亚洲的兴起，而人们对此喜欢或者不喜欢，这是完全无关重要的；这是事实。不幸的是，人们不接受事实。这里是一件实实在在的巨大事实，如你们所可想像的，这就是中国人民政府的存在这一事实。”他接着指出，“然而有些国家不承认它。联合国把台湾岛屿称为中国，这是极其离奇的事情。地理似乎对联合国或者其他国家毫无意义。以故意避免这种事实为基础的任何政策怎么能是正确的政策呢？”
    尼赫鲁说：“显然，我们不能承认两个中国。我们只能承认一个中国。事实上，并没有人能够主张有两个中国，无论如何没有一个国家能够承认有两个中国。我们有意地承认了一个中国，因为它是真正的中国。显然，台湾不是中国。”尼赫鲁是在谈到印度总统普拉沙德的演说说这番话的，总统在演说中说，我们承认了中国人民政府，我们不承认其他中国，并且中国的要求是正当的。
    他接着说，好几百年以来，除在日本占领的半世纪不到一些以外，台湾一直是中国的一部分。甚至在日本人占领台湾以后，中国也始终认为台湾是属于它自己的，并且要求对台湾的权利；中国那时存在着怎样的政府是完全无关重要的。这是中国的民族要求。除此以外，在开罗和波茨坦也都明确宣布，台湾应当归还中国。日本投降条款也提到这一点。
    尼赫鲁指出，“因此，对于台湾是中国国家的一部分这个事实，从来没有过任何怀疑。那么，在去年、二年或三年以前发生了什么事情足以改变这种情况？我不知道有任何事情足以改变这种情况，除了有人在说有人不喜欢目前的中国国家。从逻辑上或者法律上没有特别的论据。由此可见按理就是如此。——我可以了解即使合理的主张被战争或其他解决办法所推翻，这种主张也不会被取消——对于一个承认目前的中国政府的国家来说，按理必然会得出台湾是那个国家的一部分的结论。台湾目前是在受一个大国支持的蒋介石手中。”
    尼赫鲁说：“在这方面应当怎样做？我不打算对这个问题进行争辩，我只想强调一点。无论怎样做，人们应该设法进行谈判和求得和平解决。这样做可能要花费一些时间，但是，花费时间总比进行一场可能扩大而使世界上一大部分地区遭到毁灭的战争来得好。”
    尼赫鲁接着谈到中国沿海岛屿说，“沿海岛屿，特别是金门和马祖，显然肯定地是中国的一部分。它们距海岸只有几英里——五英里或者十英里。没有一个国家能够容忍任何敌人盘踞在距离它的海岸十英里远的地方并不断地对他们加以轰击。这是不可容忍的情况。因此人们几乎普遍认为应当立即从这些岛屿撤退，而使这些岛屿归大陆政府所有。然而还没有这样做。我不知道是否将这样做。我本认为这是在任何情况下都应该作到的附加步骤。”
    尼赫鲁在综述国际局势时谈到日内瓦会议，他指出，假如老挝或柬埔寨可能被用来作为反对中国的基地，那末中国自然要强烈反对。他说，在日内瓦或多或少地决定应该使老挝和柬埔寨这些印度支那国家不参加任何一方的军事条约和联盟。
    尼赫鲁指出，和平共处的五项原则在广泛流传着。尼赫鲁强调说，“我可以在人民院提出保证：即使有些政府并没有公开赞成这种主张，然而许多国家的人民被这种主张所吸引，并且不断地愈来愈被它所吸引。”
    他又说，今天世界上在思想和行动方面有许多派别，有一派自称“强硬行动”派。这是旧时代的遗迹，在旧时代，当某个小国“不规矩”的时候，就要派军舰或巡洋舰去吓唬它使它屈服。尼赫鲁认为，当一个很大的国家对一个很小的国家进行威胁的时候，强硬行动是完全行得通的。“然而，当对方也是同样强有力的时候，强硬行动就不会起多大作用了。”还有一派是“高谈以实力为后盾进行谈判的一派。”“然而，当一方发展实力来进行谈判的时候，不幸地，对方也会发展实力。”
    尼赫鲁说：“在非洲发生着骚动。在亚洲不止是骚动。事情已经发生了。革命已经爆发了。事态的整个面貌已经改变了，而且还在改变着。非洲目前发生的事情是十分有意义的和十分重要的。然而我惊异的是非洲一直受到的那种对待。我想要说的是，也许由于过去的习惯或者现在的兴趣，不管哪一方面吧，有人没有能力按事情本来的面目来看事情。我们必须了解那种已经产生的巨大的新力量。”
  “这些力量在世界上起着作用。”
    尼赫鲁谈到即将召开的亚非会议。他说：这是一次由各国政府参加的、事实上是由各国总理参加的官方会议。在这次会议上，有具有完全不同的观念形态和政治及经济结构的国家的代表参加。他说：我们有很多共同的东西，也有很多不是共同的东西。这是一次异乎寻常的会议。可是，我们举行会议这个事实具有极端重大的意义。这样的事还是第一次出现。这件事的确自然而然地说明亚洲和非洲正在走到最前列来。他认为，召开亚非会议的这个建议提得合时，并且合乎时代精神。
    尼赫鲁特再次强调这个会议是具有极其重大的意义的。他说：我希望这个会议不要开得好像是在建立一个同其他人敌对的集团。这基本上是实行共处方面的一种实验。这基本上是对待国家集团上具有这种倾向或那种倾向的亚非国家的一种实验，它们在一起友好地举行会议，设法寻求在经济、文化、或甚至政治方面实行合作的共同基础。因此这是一种具有重大意义的发展——不仅从亚洲的观点来看是如此，而且从世界观点来看也是如此。
