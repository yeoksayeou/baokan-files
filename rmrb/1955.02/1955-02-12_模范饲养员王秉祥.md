    Model Stockman Wang Bingxiang
    Li Wenshan
    Editor's Note: Wang Bingxiang, a model stockman of the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiliang Village, Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, is a newly admitted Party member. He served as a stockman in the People's Liberation Army. After being discharged and returning to his hometown, he continued in this role in the cooperative. He loves his work, cherishes public property, actively participates in labor, and strives to learn, seeking various ways to improve his professional skills. People have different abilities, but as long as one is loyal to their duty and loves their work, they can contribute to the Party's work and become a person beneficial to the people. Wang Bingxiang's revolutionary and excellent qualities are worth learning from.

    In the large courtyard in front of the cooperative chairman Wu Chun'an's house, you'll often see a diligent and happy old man. He's about fifty-seven or eight years old, but still very strong. The courtyard is full of livestock troughs; many well-fed animals are tethered to each trough. This old man is sometimes adding a sieve of grass to the trough on this side, and in the blink of an eye, he's padding the pen on the other side with soil. All day long, you never see him idle. Even at night, you can still see him running around the yard with a small lantern. No matter how tense things get, he's always humming a tune from "Linxian Luozi." Sometimes, he even quietly sings his popular quick-patter rhymes, like "This old man isn't old at heart, I must do a good job of stockbreeding" and "Everything for industrialization, no fear of any difficulties..." He can sing them endlessly.
    This old man is the stockman of the Xianfeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xiliang Village, Yicheng County, named Wang Bingxiang, and has been repeatedly selected as a labor model. Last April, he was admitted into the glorious Communist Party.

    In the old society, Wang Bingxiang was originally an extremely poor peasant from Xianyan Village, Linxian County, Henan Province. He had long lived as a vagrant in temples. He worked as a long-term farmhand for landlords, worked as a carpenter, blacksmith, reclaimed wasteland, worked as a professional sedan carrier, and sold sesame candy. In 1940, Wang Bingxiang joined the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In the army, he worked as a stockman, and in 1946, he was discharged and returned to his hometown. More than five years of revolutionary military life not only made him a skilled stockman but also a class-conscious revolutionary fighter. In the village, Wang Bingxiang is a loyal executor of the Party and government's various tasks. Three years ago, the Xianfeng Agricultural Cooperative was established, and Wang Bingxiang has been a stockman ever since. In these three years, the fourteen animals he is responsible for feeding have grown stronger and fatter day by day; none of them have suffered serious illnesses, and there have been no deaths or injuries. When someone asks Old Wang what good experience he has in raising livestock, Old Wang always says modestly: "I don't have any experience. I just treat the cooperative's livestock as if they were my own."
    Old Wang has a system for feeding livestock called "three diligences" and "four checks." The "three diligences" are diligently sweeping the trough, diligently sweeping the yard, and diligently padding the pen; the "four checks" are: checking before work whether the livestock have enough water to drink, checking after work whether the livestock's fur and eyes are right, checking when feeding grass whether the livestock have rolled around, and checking at night whether the livestock are eating well. He implements these systems very strictly. Sometimes, when the cooperative carries out labor competitions, some members are eager to take the livestock to the field, often neglecting to let the livestock drink water. But before they can get out of the gate, Old Wang pulls the livestock back again. The members say anxiously, "Don't let them drink, they're probably not thirsty." Old Wang says, "Even if they're not thirsty, this procedure can't be omitted. This is my responsibility."
    Wang Bingxiang often carefully considers the livestock's preferences, paying attention to their warmth, cold, hunger, and satiety like raising small children. When the livestock finish work, he always ties them outside the pen first, letting them rest and cool off their sweat before letting them eat. When watering the livestock, he always does it slowly, letting them drink one mouthful at a time. People often say "grass makes fat, feed gives strength, and water gives spirit." Old Wang pays great attention to timing and quantity when feeding livestock. If the livestock suffer from heatstroke, often eating a little and then resting a little, Old Wang quickly makes some mung bean water for them to drink. If the livestock suffer from cold and have stomach pain, Old Wang immediately roasts some wheat bran to warm their stomachs. Others feed livestock the same way in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Old Wang has different methods for feeding livestock in each season, and there are also differences between cloudy and sunny days. In summer, livestock often sweat, so he mixes the grass especially wet, and every three to five days, he also dissolves some salt water and mixes it in the grass for the livestock to eat. In winter, the mixed grass is drier. Winter nights are long, and the livestock's work is lighter, so Old Wang gets up to feed them two to three times every night. In summer, the nights are short, and the livestock's work is especially heavy. If they are not fed well at night, the livestock will be damaged. Therefore, once summer comes, Old Wang can't sleep at night. He gets up to feed them five or six times a night, sometimes even one after another. Only after the well-fed livestock are pulled away one by one by the members, and dawn breaks, does he fall on the bed to sleep for a while.

    In the long course of his work, Wang Bingxiang has developed extremely deep feelings for the cooperative's livestock. In the autumn of 1954, a photographer came to Xiliang Village, and he wanted to take a picture of Old Wang as a souvenir. Old Wang said that it was meaningless to just take a picture of him alone, so he asked to have a picture taken with the cooperative's Soviet-bred coarse pony.
    Two foals have already been bred for the cooperative through Old Wang's efforts. Breeding these two foals took a lot of hard work from Old Wang! The comrades from the animal husbandry and veterinary station said that female animals that are pregnant are prone to miscarriage in the third and seventh months. Before the third month, Old Wang separated the pregnant female animals from the other livestock for feeding. When the members used it for work, he repeatedly instructed them, fearing that someone would carelessly make a mistake. When the female animal was about to give birth, he stayed in the feeding room those days, having his children bring him food, and he didn't dare to leave for a moment. Every night he got up to feed the livestock, he would also gently touch the female animal's belly to see if it was time to give birth. On the day the female animal gave birth, he was the only one present. He was excited, and he was also worried. When the foal was safely born, he quickly took off his own woolen clothes and draped them over it, for fear that the foal would catch a cold.
    After the female animal gave birth, she was weak, and didn't have much milk. Old Wang cooked some rice soup for her, tried it several times, and found that this method didn't cost much and worked well, so he cooked it for two months in a row. At first, some people laughed at Old Wang for being silly, thinking that people only drink rice soup when they have children, how can livestock be compared to people? But the female animal slowly got fat, and the milk became more and more plentiful day by day, and those who originally laughed at him all shut up.
    Old Wang's care for the livestock can be said to be meticulous. Usually, whenever he walks in front of the livestock, he either gently pats their buttocks or parts the hair between their eyes with his fingers. He knows the temperaments of the fourteen animals he feeds very well. If one of them gets sick, he becomes restless, and if he doesn't see them for three or five days, he becomes very anxious. In the three years that he has been a stockman, he has only taken seven days off, and that was because he was sick. Even during those short seven days, he didn't leave the feeding room. The young man who was feeding the livestock for him, he was afraid that he didn't have experience and would be greedy for sleep at night and not feed them well.

    Old Wang is a happy old man, but he also has times when he gets angry. The reasons for his anger are mostly related to the livestock. If anyone doesn't cherish the livestock or doesn't cherish the public property of the cooperative, he will engage in fierce struggle with them.
    Once, a member, Chen Hongru, was using livestock to plow the fields, and when he came back at noon, the livestock were covered in sweat. Old Wang had experience: it's normal for livestock to sweat on their necks, but if they're sweating all over, it means they've been used too heavily. He reached out and touched them a few times and found a lot of beating marks on the livestock's bodies. He turned around and started criticizing: "Why did you use the livestock like this?" Chen Hongru said: "The ground is too wet." Old Wang said: "You can't beat the livestock just because the ground is wet!" Chen Hongru said: "What's the big deal about hitting the livestock a few times?" Old Wang got even angrier: "When you get anxious, you know to vent your anger on the livestock, why don't you beat yourself?" Chen Hongru was unhappy about being criticized like this, but he felt that he was in the wrong, so he didn't say anything else. But Old Wang didn't calm down because of this. He said: "I'm going to report this behavior of yours of not cherishing public property to the cooperative committee!" Later, Chen Hongru received a criticism at the members' meeting, and the matter was considered over.
    Another time, a member, Yao Hanzhang, used livestock to pull the cotton gin to gin cotton for the cooperative without notifying Old Wang beforehand. He randomly led away a donkey that hadn't been fed yet. When Old Wang came back from home with a bowl of rice, he found that one animal was missing, so he put down his bowl and looked around. After finding it, he unloaded the donkey from the cotton gin without saying a word. Yao Hanzhang said dissatisfied: "If you can't gin the cotton, I'll hold you accountable!" Old Wang said: "No matter what you say, no one can use the livestock if they're not fed well. Besides, you didn't notify me in advance that you wanted to use the livestock." Yao Hanzhang had no choice but to watch him lead the livestock back and feed them well before leading them out again for use.
    After Old Wang got angry at those members who didn't cherish the livestock a few times, some members became dissatisfied with him. They said it was "a monk scolding a Taoist, meddling too much." When Old Wang heard these reactions, he thought: "I'm going to interfere even if you're not happy because I'm responsible to the whole cooperative, responsible to everyone, not for my personal gain." Later, the person in charge of the Party branch in the cooperative and the cooperative chairman Wu Chun'an and others came to help Old Wang specifically, praising his work spirit and also pointing out that he should pay attention to having a kind attitude when getting along with the members. After that, Old Wang paid attention to this point. When the members went to lead the livestock, he took the initiative to explain the importance of cherishing the livestock to everyone. He said: "Livestock is a very large asset of our whole cooperative. If the big river has no water, the small river will dry up. If this asset is damaged, it will be detrimental to everyone." Gradually, the members also paid attention to cherishing the cooperative's livestock.
    Although Wang Bingxiang is a skilled stockman, he is not satisfied with this. Since being discharged from the army and settling in Xiliang Village, from the first day he served as a stockman in the agricultural cooperative, he had publicly expressed his determination to do a good job of stockbreeding, work hard to learn, and overcome difficulties. Old Wang has many methods of learning. When Veterinarian Ding from the animal husbandry and veterinary station comes to the cooperative to treat the livestock, he follows closely behind him every time, watching carefully; he keeps asking questions if he doesn't understand something. Usually, he pays close attention to learning from the other three stockmen in the cooperative. While constantly improving his cultural level, he also attaches importance to learning from books. Old Wang said that he has many "military books," such as "Horse Breeding Technology," "Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine," "Common Infectious Diseases of Horses," and the like. These books are always by his bedside all year round, and whenever he has free time, he puts on his reading glasses to study them. Nowadays, the members say that Old Wang has become "half a veterinarian." Indeed, for some common ailments that livestock often get, Old Wang can take out his self-prepared tools to treat them without asking for a specialized veterinarian.
    Old Wang not only learns the technology of feeding livestock, but he also keeps a close grip on political study. In recent years, he has successively read "Thirty Years of the Communist Party of China," "On the Cultivation of Communists," "How to Be a Communist," and "Reader of Political Common Sense," and so on. He has a high degree of class consciousness, he has an unparalleled love for the new society, and he demands that he be able to do more in the cause of socialist construction.

    模范饲养员王秉祥
    李文珊
    编者按：山西省翼城县西梁村先锋农业生产合作社模范饲养员王秉祥是一个新入党的党员。他在人民解放军中服务的时候，就是一个饲养员，复员回乡以后，在合作社中仍然担任这一工作。他热爱自己的工作，热爱公共财产，积极劳动，并且努力学习，想尽各种办法提高业务能力。一个人能力各有大小，但只要他能忠于自己的职责，热爱自己的工作，就能为党的工作做出成绩来，成为一个有益于人民的人。王秉祥的这种革命的优秀品质是值得学习的。
    在社长吴春安门前那座大院子里，你会经常看到一个勤劳而快乐的老人。他今年约摸有五十七、八岁，但身体还很硬实。这院子里到处都是牲口槽；每个槽上都拴着许多膘满肉肥的牲口。这老人一会儿到这边槽上给牲口添一筛子草，转眼工夫就又到那边圈里垫起土来。一整天，看不到他有闲下的时候。到了夜晚，你仍会看到他掂着小灯笼在院子里跑来跑去。不管事情多么紧张，他嘴里却总是哼着一口“林县落子”腔。有时，他还会悄悄地唱起他那个受人欢迎的快板来，什么“我老汉人老心不老，饲养工作要做好”和什么“一切为了工业化，任何困难都不怕。……”一唱就是没有个完。
    这老人就是翼城县西梁村先锋农业生产合作社的饲养员，他叫王秉祥，多次被评选为劳动模范。去年四月已被吸收为光荣的共产党员了。
                ×　×　×
    在旧社会里王秉祥原是河南省林县仙岩村一个极贫苦的农民，他曾经长期流离失所住在庙宇里。他给地主扛过长工，当过木匠，打过铁，开过荒坡，当过职业轿夫，卖过麻糖。一九四零年，王秉祥参加了中国人民解放军。在部队他担任了饲养员的工作，一九四六年他复员回到地方。五年多的革命军事生活，不但使他成了一个熟练的饲养员，而且使他成了一个具有阶级觉悟的革命战士。平时在村里王秉祥是党和政府各种工作的忠心执行者。三年前先锋农业社成立了，从那个时候起王秉祥又当了饲养员，在这三年的时间里，他所负责喂养的那十四头牲口一天比一天壮、一天比一天肥；没有一个害过严重的疾病，更没有死伤的现象。有人问老王喂养牲口有些什么好经验，老王总是谦虚地说：“没有什么经验。我不过是把社里的牲口当成自家的牲口一样看待。”
    老王喂牲口有个制度叫“三勤”、“四检查”。这“三勤”是勤扫槽、勤扫院和勤垫圈；“四检查”是：上工前检查牲口喝水足不足、下工后检查牲口毛眼对不对、喂草时检查牲口是否打过滚、夜晚间检查牲口吃势好不好。这些制度他执行得非常严格。有时，社里开展了劳动竞赛，有些社员急着拉牲口下地，往往顾不得让牲口喝水。但是不等他们走出大门，老王就把牲口又拉回来。社员们着急说：“不要饮吧，大概它不渴。”老王说：“就是它不渴也不能免掉这道手续。这是我的责任。”
    王秉祥经常细心揣摸牲口的爱好，像养育小孩子一样注意它们的寒暖和饥饱。牲口下了工，他总是先把它们拴在圈外，让它们歇一歇、落落汗，然后才让它们吃东西。饮牲口时，他都是缓缓的，让它们喝了一口再喝一口。人常说“草膘料力水精神”。老王喂牲口十分注意定时和定量。牲口中了暑，常常是吃一阵、歇一阵，老王就赶紧冲些绿豆水让它们喝。牲口中了寒，肚痛，老王发现了，就立即烤些麸皮给它们暖暖肚。别人喂牲口春夏秋冬一个样。老王喂牲口各个季节却有各个季节的办法，而且阴天和晴天还有区别。夏天，牲口常出汗，他给牲口拌草就拌得特别湿，隔个三天五日还要化些盐水拌在草里给牲口吃。冬天，拌草就拌得较干些。冬天夜长，牲口的活计较轻，老王每夜起来喂它们两次到三次。到夏天夜短了，牲口的营生也特别繁重，如果黑夜喂不好，牲口就要受损伤。因此，一到夏天，老王在夜晚就睡不着觉了。他一夜要起来喂五、六次，有时甚至是一次接一次。直等到喂饱了的牲口让社员们一个一个拉走，天明了以后，他才倒在床上稍微睡一会儿。
                ×　×　×
    在长期的工作过程中，王秉祥对社里的牲口发生了极其深厚的感情。一九五四年秋天，有一个摄影记者到了西梁村，他想给老王拍个照片留作纪念。老王说光照他一个人没有什么意思，后来他要求把社里那个苏联古粗种小马驹儿和他照在一起了。
    经老王的手已经给社里繁殖下两个小驹儿了。因为繁殖这两个小驹儿，老王可受了不小的辛苦呵！听畜牧兽医站的同志说母畜怀驹后在三个月和七个月头上肯流产。不等到三个月头上，老王就把怀驹的母畜和其它牲口分开喂养了。社员们使用它做活儿，他千嘱咐、万嘱咐，生怕有人不小心使出漏子来。母畜快生产的时候，那些天，他都守在饲养房里，吃饭都让他孩子送，他一步也不敢离开。每天夜里他起来喂牲口，就顺便去轻轻地摸摸母畜的肚，看是否已经到了生产的时候。母畜生产的那天，就他一个人在跟前。他兴奋，他也耽心。当小驹儿安全地生下时，他赶紧脱下自己一件绒衣给它披上，唯恐小驹受了凉。
    母畜生产以后，身体瘦弱，奶也不多。老王给它熬上些米汤，试验了几次，这个办法花钱不多效果又好，他就一气熬了两个月。开初，有些人还笑老王傻气，认为人生了小孩才喝米汤哩，牲口怎能跟人比呢。可是母畜慢慢的肥起来了，奶汁也一天比一天地多起来，原来笑话他的人便都住了嘴。
    老王对牲口的爱护可说是无微不至。平常，只要他走在牲口跟前，不是轻轻拍拍它们的屁股，就是岔开手指理理它们的毛眼。他把他所喂养的十四头牲口的脾性都摸得熟熟的。如果有一头得了病，他就坐卧不安了，要是让他隔个三天两日不见它们的面，他就非常心慌。他当饲养员三年来，只请过七天假，这是因为他生病。就是这短短的七天，他也没有离开过饲养房。替他喂养牲口的是个年轻人，他怕他没有经验、黑夜贪睡喂不好。
                ×　×　×
    老王是个快乐的老人，但是他也有发脾气的时候。发脾气的原因，大都是为了牲口的事。谁要是不爱惜牲口，不爱护社内的公共财产，他就和他们进行激烈的斗争。
    有一次，社员陈鸿儒使牲口犁地，晌午回来时，牲口浑身是汗。老王有经验：牲口脖子上出汗是个正常现象，要是全身出汗就是使得过重了。他伸手摸了两把，发现牲口身上有好多挨打的痕迹，他扭回头就批评开了：“为什么你把牲口使成这个样子？”陈鸿儒说：“地里太湿。”老王说：“地湿也不能打牲口呀！”陈鸿儒说：“打几下牲口有什么了不起。”老王火气更大了：“着了急就知道在牲口身上出毒，你为啥不打你自己来？”陈鸿儒受了这顿批评，心里很不是味，不过他觉得自己理屈，也就没再啃声。但老王并没有因此而消了气。他说：“我要向社务委员会报告你这种不爱护公共财产的行为！”后来，陈鸿儒在社员大会上受了一次批评，事情才算完结。
    还有一次，社员姚汉章用牲口拉轧花车给社里轧棉花，事先没有通知老王，他就胡乱到圈里牵走一头还没有喂饱的驴。当老王从家里端着饭碗回来时，发现少了一头牲口，就放下饭碗四处找寻。找到以后，二话没说就把这头驴从轧花车上卸下来。姚汉章不满意地说：“轧不出棉花来就朝你算账！”老王说：“不管你说啥，牲口喂不好谁也不能使。再说你事先也没有通知我你要用牲口。”姚汉章没办法，只好眼巴巴地让他把牲口牵回去，喂好以后才又牵出来使用。
    老王对那些不爱护牲口的社员发了几次脾气以后，有些社员对他不满起来了。他们说这是“和尚训道士，管得宽”。老王听到这些反映，心里想：“你不高兴我也要管，反正我这是对全社负责、对大家负责，又不是为了我个人。”后来，社里党支部负责人和社长吴春安等都来具体地帮助老王，表扬了他的工作精神，同时也指出和社员们相处，要注意态度和蔼。以后老王就注意了这一点。社员们去牵牲口时，他就主动向大家解释爱护牲口的重要意义。他说：“牲口是咱全社一笔很大的财产。大河没水小河干。如果这笔财产受了损失，那对大家都不利。”慢慢的，社员们也就都注意爱护社里的牲口了。
    王秉祥虽然是一个熟练的饲养员，但他不以此为满足，从部队复员到西梁村安家以来，从他担任农业社饲养员的第一天起，就曾经当众表示决心做好饲养工作，努力学习，克服困难。老王学习的方法很多。畜牧兽医站的丁兽医到社里来给牲口治病，他每次都要跟在后面看个仔细；弄不清的还不断发问。平时，他很注意向社里其它三个饲养员学习。在不断提高文化水平的同时，他还重视了向书本学习。老王说他有许多“兵书”，这就是“养马技术”、“畜牧兽医”、“马常发生的传染病”等一类的书。这些书一年四季都不离他的床头，一有闲空，他就戴起老花眼镜来钻研。如今，社员们说老王已经成了“半个兽医”。的确，牲口常得的一些普通病症，老王不请专门兽医就可以拿出他自备的家具来治疗。
    老王不光学习喂养牲口的技术，他对政治学习也抓得非常紧。这几年来，他先后读过“中国共产党的三十年”、“论共产党员的修养”、“怎样做一个共产党员”和“政治常识读本”等等。他有较高的阶级觉悟，他对新社会有无比的热爱，他要求自己能在社会主义建设事业中做更多事情。
