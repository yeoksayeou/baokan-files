The Hanoi-Nanning Railway, being constructed simultaneously from the North and South, was connected at 3:20 PM on February 8th, at a point 66 kilometers and 400 meters from Hanoi.

At 3:50 PM, as workers from both sides swung their hammers to nail the last spike, and two engineering trains, adorned with the national flags of Vietnam and China and portraits of President Ho and Chairman Mao, slowly pulled in, the construction site erupted in earth-shaking cheers. Vietnamese workers and technicians, along with the Chinese workers and technicians who had recently come to help build the railway, shook hands and embraced tightly, shouting the same sentiment in different languages – "Mo Nam!" "Long live!"

Near the connection point marked "66.400", on a gentle slope bisected by the railway, and in the green fields on both sides of the roadbed, were densely packed people. They had come from the surrounding suburbs to participate in the joining ceremony. There were Kinh (Viet), Tho, Nung, and Muong people, dressed in various ethnic costumes, excitedly waving hats, headscarves, or whatever they could find. Some couldn't help but jump onto the tracks and shake hands with the busy workers. The weather was already warm enough, but people's emotions were even hotter, practically boiling. The loudspeakers repeatedly asked people to move back slightly, but many still crowded around the connection point, leaving the cinematographers no room to maneuver. An elderly man with graying temples peered eagerly from the crowd, saying excitedly:
“Our railway is connected! Our railway is connected!” This seemingly sturdy 65-year-old farmer, Deng Tingxiang, lived in Xinsheng Village, two kilometers away. His two friends, Du Wen Da and Li Jingwei, both 69 years old, had agreed to come together to see "our railway" connected.

The first line built by the Vietnamese people after the restoration of peace – the Hanoi-Nanning Railway – will soon be officially open to traffic. The main line of this railway is 166 kilometers and 600 meters long. It starts from Hanoi, the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, crosses the 1,800-meter-long Red River Iron Bridge (Long Bien Bridge), and extends northeast, passing through the fertile plains of the northern corner of the famous Red River Delta, Bac Ninh Province, and Bac Giang Province, then through hilly areas into the mountainous Lang Son Province, finally reaching the Nanning border crossing on the border between Vietnam and China, passing through the Fubo Ridge Tunnel, and connecting with the southward extension of China's Xiang-Gui Railway.

The Hanoi-Nanning Railway is of great importance to the restoration and construction of the Vietnamese national economy. Immediately after the ceasefire in August 1954, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam actively planned to restore this railway. Construction began on the entire line on October 22nd, twelve days after the liberation of Hanoi. At that time, there were many difficulties: north of An Yuan, not a single section of the 150-kilometer-long roadbed was intact, all 24 bridges, large and small, had been destroyed, there were no rails or sleepers on the roadbed, only weeds, barbed wire, trenches, air-raid shelters, bunkers, mines, time bombs, and cluster bombs left by the French colonialists. The organization responsible for the restoration work had just been established, lacking experienced administrative cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and skilled workers, while the task was extremely urgent and arduous. Although the difficulties were great, they could not frighten the heroic Vietnamese people who had defeated the French colonialists and American interventionists, nor could they stop their strong will to restore peaceful life and build their own country. Engineering teams were established one after another. These teams included people from the mountainous areas of the old liberated areas of North Vietnam, from the Red River Delta, from the central Vietnamese, coastal and highland provinces, and from the Mekong River Delta of South Vietnam; they included farmers from the old and new liberated areas who had turned over through land reform or rent reduction movements, soldiers and laborers who had participated in the Dien Bien Phu campaign, guerrillas who had ambushed enemy boats, cars, and trains, old railway workers and rubber plantation workers, young people from Hanoi and other cities, and working people of various ethnic groups such as Kinh, Tho, Nung, Thai, Miao, and Muong, living in the plains and forests, men and women, old and young, all came voluntarily, some even bringing with them simple tools they had collected for many years to participate in the restoration work on the railway line.

There were many things to be done. Work had to start immediately. So, some people went to the forest to cut sleepers, some went to the mountains to dig stones, some went to dismantle bunkers and destroy barbed wire, some went to clear mines, time bombs, and cluster bombs, some did earthwork, some erected power lines, some repaired bridges and culverts, some laid rails, … After finishing this work, they rushed to do another urgent job. The progress of the project was getting faster and faster, and efficiency was increasing day by day. For making stone blocks, initially each person could only make 1.6 to 3 cubic meters per day, but later it increased to 15.7 cubic meters, and some even reached 22 cubic meters, several times more than the standard of 4.5 cubic meters. For repairing the roadbed, initially each person could only dig 1.8 cubic meters of gravel and 1.2 cubic meters of earth per day, but later the general improvement was to 6 cubic meters of gravel and 7 cubic meters of earth, with the highest reaching 18 cubic meters. For making sleepers, the forestry construction sites in Lang Son, Bac Giang, and Thai Nguyen, all overfulfilled the task ahead of schedule by one to fifteen days.

The bridge project was the main key to the entire line. Due to the active efforts and hard study of the workers and cadres, all the large and small bridge projects were completed ahead of schedule. The relatively large Lang Son, Tong Mo, Hua Jiang, Fu Liangshang and other iron bridges on the entire line were completed fourteen to twenty-four days ahead of the original plan.

The rails from the north and south passed through the repaired bridges and extended forward. On the places where the tracks had already been laid, one could often see engineering trains and small handcarts, loaded with rails, sleepers, and meals, running back and forth. When the track engineering team moved forward, tents or small sheds made of nylon cloth appeared in the nearby fields. The workers took turns resting inside after the tense track laying work. In order to strive for early connection and early traffic, the workers pushed forward day and night. The scene on the construction site at night was extraordinarily moving: gas lamps and carbide lamps illuminated a large area. Here was the sound of electric drills drilling holes in the hard sleepers; there was the shouting of the workers pulling rails, the heavy collision sound of the rails falling on the sleepers, and the crisp sound of nailing tracks; occasionally one could hear the piercing whistle of the locomotive pulling materials; and there was the noise and laughter of children who had come to watch the excitement from somewhere…

The line workers were working with very high efficiency under extremely difficult conditions. The progress of their track laying from both north and south reached a maximum of 7.1 kilometers per day and night.

In order to restore their own railway, workers, farmers, and other masses in the old and newly liberated areas of North Vietnam spontaneously launched a movement to collect materials. People salvaged rusty rails from ponds, dug up screws from underground, carried wood to the forest, demolished bricks and tiles from bunkers left by the enemy, and some dismantled the rails and sleepers they had collected from their own sheds in the past. Then, people transported them from all directions to the railway line by car, ox cart, tricycle, and boat, the farthest place being 250 kilometers away from the railway. According to preliminary statistics, the railway received more than 19,000 tons of rails and sleepers transported by the people. The people’s care for their own railway was meticulous. The masses along the railway line voluntarily gave their houses to the workers and laborers to live in, and helped them solve difficulties in various aspects such as vegetable and firewood supply. Just when the workers were rushing to lay the rails, a message spread on the line: An old man named Ying, 53 years old, from Dafu Commune in Bac Ninh Province, used to work on the Hanoi-Nanning Railway. Because he hid the things in the warehouse and prevented the French soldiers from destroying them, he was arrested and tortured many times, but the old man never revealed a word. After the ceasefire, the French soldiers withdrew. Hearing that the government of the Democratic Republic was going to repair this railway, the old man voluntarily offered all his things and insisted on participating in the restoration work. There was more than one such story, and the workers worked even harder after hearing it.

The Hanoi-Nanning Railway has only been under construction for three and a half months, and it has already been connected. This is a great victory for the Vietnamese people in the restoration of economic construction. In the past, in order to step up the plundering of the Vietnamese people and invade China's Guangxi Province, the French colonialists began to plan the construction of this railway in 1889, but it was not until 1902 that the line from Hanoi to Dong Deng City in Lang Son Province was completed, after 13 years of effort. The last extension of the 5-kilometer-long line from Dong Deng to Nanning was not completed until 1908. Here is a very interesting comparison figure: When the French colonialists built the road, it took them a full month and a half to build a 500-meter-long siding at the Taqiao Station in Bac Ninh Province, and they had not yet laid stone ballast; the Vietnamese people used only two days to build two 500-meter-long sidings at the Taqiao Station, and if even including the renovation and laying of stone ballast, it only took four days.

When people were waiting for the moment of connection with extreme excitement, we took a rest in the courtyard of a farmhouse not far from the railway, next to Highway 1. It was the workers' break time. A group of people were sitting scattered under the awning in the courtyard. When they found out that I was a Chinese comrade and also understood some Vietnamese, they slowly gathered around. After asking, I learned that most of them were from the Qinghua Province and Yian Province areas of the Fourth Inter-District of Central Vietnam. Among them were Kinh, as well as Muong and Thai people. Now they formed an engineering team, laying tracks at the forefront of the line. We talked very casually and happily (although sometimes we had to use gestures to supplement the lack of language). A Muong farmer, Pei Tuo Shun, told me that he had never seen a railway before. He was afraid of the railway, because his grandfather had been arrested by French soldiers to build the railway from Central Vietnam to Saigon in South Vietnam. He had to bring his own rice to work, and he was still beaten. This left a very deep impression on him since he was a child. Before the "August Revolution," his family of fourteen had no land at all; later, after the establishment of the democratic government, his family was allocated one and a half mu of land (the Central Vietnamese mu, one mu is about more than seven Chinese mu), plus responding to President Ho Chi Minh's call to increase production and practice economy, his life was getting better and better. This time, hearing that the railway was going to be repaired, he voluntarily came out to participate. Pei Tuo Shun pointed to the railway stretching forward and said: "Now it is different from the French occupation period. The railway is our own, which is beneficial to the people's travel and production. When I hear the locomotive honking, I feel happy!" He now carries sleepers, and can carry up to 70 a day (each weighing sixty or seventy kilograms). Sitting next to me was a person wearing a faded Vietnamese People's Army uniform. His name was Chen Jun, a disabled soldier. His old home was originally in Nam Dinh Province. Because he followed his father to work on the Hanoi-Nanning Railway since he was a child, he settled in Taqiao Town in Bac Ninh Province. He joined the revolution locally in 1944, and was injured in a battle in 1951. He was transferred to the engineering corps to set time bombs. During the Dien Bien Phu campaign, he drove a steamship at a certain ferry, ensuring the passage of vehicles to and from the front and rear. After the restoration of peace, Chen Jun volunteered to be a railway worker, and sure enough, the superiors ordered him to be transferred to the railway. Twenty years ago, Chen Jun's father worked as a servant for the French stationmaster at Lang Son Station. He was kicked down by him and scalded by boiling water. At that time, he couldn't eat or drink, and he died at home in Taqiao a few days later. At that time, Chen Jun thought: One day, when the colonialists are driven away, the country is free and independent, and the Vietnamese people build their own railway, and he can contribute to it, how good it would be! Now, Chen Jun's ideal has begun to be realized.

    越南人民的第一条铁路
    本报驻越南记者　展潮
    从南、北两边同时赶修的河内—南关铁路，已经在二月八日下午三时二十分，在离河内六十六公里又四百公尺的地方接轨了。
    三时五十分，当两边的工人抡着锤子钉完最后一颗道钉，两列高挂着越、中两国国旗和胡主席、毛主席像的工程列车徐徐开进的时候，工地上响起一片震天动地的欢呼声。越南工人和技术人员，跟不久前来帮助修路的中国工人和技术人员，紧紧地握手、拥抱，用不同的语言高呼着同一个意思——“莫南！”“万岁！”
    插着“六六·四○○”标志的接轨点附近，在铁路从中间切过的一个不很高的山坡上，在路基两侧的绿色的原野里，拥满着密密麻麻的人。他们都是从四郊赶来参加接轨仪式的。这里有京族（越族）、仕族、侬族和孟族人，他们穿戴着各种不同的民族服饰，兴奋地挥动帽子、头巾或者别的东西。有的人情不自禁地跳到线路上和忙得不可开交的工人们握手。天气已经是够暖的了，而人们的感情更热，简直高到了沸点。扩音器一再请人们稍为让开些，可是许多人还是挤到接轨点上去，电影摄影师们连回旋的余地都没有了。一位须鬓花白的老年人竭力从人缝里往中间瞧，他兴致勃勃地对人说：
  “我们的铁路连起来了！我们的铁路连起来了！”这位看来还壮实、已经六十五岁的老农民邓亭祥，家住在两公里以外的新盛村里。他的两位朋友——杜文答和黎景为，今年都是六十九岁的人了，但是为着看“我们的铁路”接轨，几个人便约定一起来了。
    越南人民在和平恢复后修建的第一条线路——河内—南关铁路，全线不久就要正式通车了。这条铁路正线共长一百六十六公里又六百公尺。它从越南民主共和国首都河内开始，横跨过一千八百多公尺的红河大铁桥（龙边铁桥），一直指向东北，经过有名的红河三角洲的北角、北宁省和北池省富饶的平原，然后通过丘陵地带进入处在群山中的谅山省，最后到达了越、中两国边界的南关，穿进伏泊岭隧道，和我国湘桂铁路向南延伸的线路衔接。
    河内—南关铁路，对于越南国民经济的恢复和建设，具有极大的重要性。一九五四年八月刚一停战，越南民主共和国政府就积极筹划修复这条铁路。十月二十二日，河内解放后十二天就开始全线施工。当时所遇到的困难是很多的：自安员以北，一百五十多公里长的路基没有一段是完整的，所有二十四座大小桥梁全被破坏了，在路基上没有一根铁轨，也没有一根枕木，有的是法国殖民者留下来的荒草、铁丝网、堑壕、防空洞、碉堡、地雷、定时炸弹和子母弹。担负修复工作的组织机构刚刚建立，缺乏有经验的行政管理干部，缺乏工程技术人员和熟练工人，而任务却异常紧迫而繁重。困难虽然大，却吓不倒战胜了法国殖民者和美国干涉者的英雄的越南人民，也阻挡不住他们恢复和平生活、建设自己祖国的坚强意志。一支支工程队成立起来了。这里面有来自北越老解放区山岳地带的，有来自红河三角洲的，有来自中越、沿海和高原各省的，也有来自南越湄公河三角洲的；这里面有经过土地改革或减租运动翻了身的老区和新区的农民，有参加过奠边府战役的战士和民工，有伏击过敌人船艇、汽车和火车的游击队员，有年老的铁路工人和橡胶园工人，有河内以及其他城市的青年，还有居住在平原和山林里的京、仕、侬、泰、苗、孟等各族的劳动人民，男女老少，他们都是自动来的，有的人还随身带着收藏了多年的简单工具，赶到铁路线上参加修复工作。
    摆在面前的事情很多。马上就要动手做。于是，有人到森林里去砍枕木，有人到山上去挖石头，有人去拆碉堡和毁铁丝网，有人去扫除地雷、定时炸弹和子母弹，有人去做土方，有人去架电线，有人去修桥梁和涵洞，有人去铺铁轨，……做完了这个活又赶去做另一个紧急的活。工程进展一天比一天快，效率一天比一天提高。做石头块，最初每人每天只能做一·六立方公尺到三立方公尺，后来增高到十五·七立方公尺，有的甚至达到二十二立方公尺，比规定标准四·五立方公尺要多好几倍。修补路基，最初每人每天只能掏碎石一·八立方公尺、挖土一·二立方公尺，后来掏碎石普遍提高到六立方公尺、挖土七立方公尺，最高的竟达到十八立方公尺。做枕木，谅山、北江、太原等林区工地，都提前一天到十五天超额完成了任务。
    桥梁工程是全线的主要关键，由于工人和干部们的积极努力和刻苦的学习，结果所有大小桥梁工程都先期完成。全线比较大的谅山、同模、化江、府谅商等铁桥，比原计划提前十四天到二十四天竣工。
    南北两边的铁轨从修复了的桥梁上通过，一直向前延伸。在已经铺好轨道的地方，经常可以看见满载着铁轨、枕木和饭菜的工程列车以及小手车，来往运行。当线路工程队向前推进的时候，附近的田野里便出现一座座帐篷或者用尼龙布搭成的小棚。工人们在紧张的铺轨工作之后，便轮替着在里面休息。为了争取提前接轨、提前通车，工人们不分昼夜地向前推进。工地上夜晚的景象是异常动人的：汽灯和电石灯照亮了一大片。这里是电钻在坚硬的枕木上钻眼的声音；那里是拉铁轨工人的叫声，铁轨搬落到枕木上沉重的碰击声，清脆的钉道声；间或还可以听到拉材料的机车刺耳的汽笛声；还有不知从什么地方赶来看热闹的孩子们的吵嚷和笑声。……
    线路工人们在十分困难的条件下，以非常高的效率来工作着。他们南北两边钉道的进度，一昼夜最高达到七·一公里。
    为了修复人民自己的铁路，北越老解放区和新解放区的工人、农民以及其他群众，自动发起搜集材料的运动。人们从池沼里把生锈的铁轨捞上来，从地下把螺丝钉挖出来，到森林去抬木料，到敌人遗留下来的碉堡里拆砖瓦，有的人从自己的棚架子上拆下过去收藏起来的铁轨和铁枕木。然后，人们再用汽车、牛车、三轮车和船只，从四面八方运送到铁路线上来，最远的地方离铁路二百五十公里。据初步统计，铁路上接到人民运送来的铁轨、铁枕木等共一万九千多吨。人民对自己铁路的爱护是无微不至的。铁路沿线的群众，自动让房子给工人和民工住，帮助他们解决蔬菜、柴火供应等各方面的困难。正当工人们突击铺铁轨的时候，线路上流传开一个消息：北宁省大福社有一位名叫做萤的五十三岁的老人，过去曾经在河内—南关铁路上干过事，因为他把仓库里的东西收藏起来不让法国兵破坏，好多次被抓去拷打，老头子始终不露一个字。停战后法国兵撤走了。听说民主共和国政府要修这条铁路，老头子自动把全部东西献出来，并坚决要求参加修复工作。这样的故事不只一个，工人们听了干活更加有劲了。
    河内—南关铁路，自从动工到现在，总共只有三个半月，就已经接轨了，这是越南人民在恢复经济建设中一个伟大的胜利，过去法国殖民者为了加紧掠夺越南人民并侵略我国的广西省，从一八八九年就开始筹建这条铁路，但是一直到一九○二年才修成从河内到谅山省同登市的路线，前后花了十三年功夫。最后增修的从同登到南关一段五公里长的线路，到一九○八年才修成。这里有一个很有意思的比较数字：法国殖民者筑路的时候，在北宁省塔桥车站修一条五百公尺长的岔道，整整花了一个半月，还没有上石渣；越南人民在塔桥车站修两条五百公尺长的岔道，只用了两天功夫，如果连上整修和铺石渣，也不过是四天功夫罢了。
    当人们怀着极度兴奋的心情，等待着接轨那一刻到来的时候，我们在离铁路不远、傍依着一号公路旁边的一家农舍的院落里歇脚。当时正是工人们休息的时候，院落里凉棚下散乱地坐着一伙人，当他们发现我是中国同志，并且还懂得些越南话，便慢慢地聚拢来了。相问之下，才知道他们大多数是属于中越四联区清化省和义安省一带的人，他们中间有京族，也有孟族和泰族，现在组成一个工程队，在线路最前面铺轨钉道。我们谈得很随便畅快
  （虽然有时候得用手势来补充语言的不足）。一位孟族农民裴妥顺告诉我，他过去从来没有见过铁路，他害怕铁路，因为他祖父曾被法国兵抓去修从中越到南越西贡的铁路。自己带米去做工，还得挨打。这从小就给他留下很深刻的印象。“八月革命”前，他家十四口人没有半分田；后来民主政府成立起来，他家分到一亩半田（中越亩，一亩约等于中国七亩多），再加上响应胡志明主席号召增产节约，生活是越来越好过了。这次听说要修铁路，他便自动出来参加。裴妥顺指着向前伸展的铁路说：“现在不同法占时期，铁路是我们自己的，对人民来往生产都有利。我听到火车头呜呜叫，心里就高兴！”他现在扛枕木，每天可以扛到七十根
  （每根六、七十公斤）。坐在我旁边是一位穿着已经退了色的越南人民军军服的人，他叫做陈军，是个残废军人。他老家本来是南定省，因为从小跟着父亲到河内—南关铁路上做事，便落户在北宁省的塔桥镇，一九四四年就在当地参加了革命，一九五一年在一次战役中负了伤，转到工兵部队去起定时炸弹。在奠边府战役中，他在某个渡口上驾驶汽船，保证前后方车辆的通行。和平恢复后，陈军志愿当个铁路工人，果然上级来命令把他调到铁路上去了。二十年前，陈军的父亲在谅山车站给法国站长当仆役，被他踢倒给开水烫伤，当时饭水不下，回到塔桥家里几天就死掉了。那时候，陈军心想：有那么一天赶走了殖民者，国家自由独立了，越南人民修起自己的铁路，而他也在这中间出一分力量，该是多么好啊！现在，陈军的理想开始实现了。
