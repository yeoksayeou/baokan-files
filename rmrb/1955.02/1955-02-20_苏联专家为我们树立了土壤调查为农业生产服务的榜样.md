Soviet Experts Set an Example of Soil Survey Serving Agricultural Production for Us
Sun Qu, Member of the Land Survey Team of the State-owned Friendship Farm, Vice Dean of Beijing Agricultural University

I am a soil science worker, and for several years, I have also been working hard to learn advanced Soviet soil science, but I am often troubled by not being able to solve certain key problems. For example, how soil science can serve agricultural production is one of the most important issues. This time, during more than two months of participating in the exploration work of the State-owned Friendship Farm, I realized from the work of the Soviet experts what a truly advanced soil science worker is; moreover, through a series of specific tasks, I deeply realized how advanced soil science is closely integrated with production.

How to be a Good Soil Science Worker
One sunny afternoon in mid-November last year, the ground was already frozen half a foot deep, and the cold wind on the prairie penetrated people's cotton-padded clothes and trousers. The Soviet experts and Chinese comrades of our soil survey team had been working continuously in the wilderness for six or seven hours, and everyone had not even had a sip of water. At this time, we finished observing a soil pit, and another new soil pit had not yet been dug. The Soviet expert seized this gap and gave us a cordial lecture, the theme of which was that as a soil scientist, one must recognize the great responsibility he bears to the people. He said decisively, "Since you are a soil scientist, you must tell agricultural producers what to plant on this land and how to utilize it. It is not you doing your soil research and them planting their land. Your work is closely related to the farm work." His words were so earnest and full of friendship that I was very moved. In the years since liberation, we have recognized that soil science must serve production, and we often use it to educate students; but after more than two months of field work, I realized how to truly serve agricultural production. Serving production is not just thinking about it in general when working, nor is it just walking from the house to the field, or just combining with production in some problems and aspects; but how to permeate every work with the specific requirements of production, no matter how small it is. Taking the work of these two months as an example, for example, in the land and natural conditions of Sandao Gang in Jixian County, Heilongjiang Province, to plant "grains," a soil scientist must clearly propose which land can be planted, which land cannot be planted, which land can be planted after treatment, and how to utilize this land to complete the task assigned by the state to the farm.

Soviet experts patiently told us: A soil scientist is the spokesperson for the soil; the soil cannot speak, and you are a soil scientist, so it relies on you to speak for it. Whether it can fully exert its strength depends on you; whether it can be competent for the tasks assigned to it also depends on you. Once the plan is set, if there are problems in the future, the problem lies with you—its spokesperson. A soil scientist must also be a soil doctor, must care about the health of the land, understand its pain, and help agronomists to heal its pain so that it can produce more grain for us.

Production Requirements Determine Every
      Aspect of the Work
In 1952, our country's soil workers had conducted some surveys in the Sandao Gang area. The work in 1952 was much improved compared to the work before liberation, but compared with this soil survey guided and presided over by Soviet experts today, there are great differences. Here I will only mention a few of the more important projects in the work:

First of all, let's talk about digging pits. "Digging pits" is the basic means of studying soil (many soil workers in our country did not recognize this in the past). Soviet experts once said: "A botanist is all about plant specimens, plant specimens all day long, and a soil scientist is all about digging pits, digging pits." Only by carefully observing and analyzing the soil pit can we see the ins and outs of a soil and correctly grasp its laws of occurrence.

However, digging pits is not an easy task. If the pit is dug improperly, the conclusions drawn will be harmful. Where to dig pits and how many pits to dig must be determined according to production requirements. That is to say, after observing these test pits, we must be able to understand the production and utilization of the soil, and we must be able to tell the comrades who manage the farm which land can be planted with what, which cannot be planted with what, and how to plant it. In 1952, we dug pits on this land, not to mention that we dug too few, and they were also too small and shallow. In this way, the reaction of lime, one of the important bases for determining the soil type, was not grasped. The "depth of groundwater," which is most related to soil formation (that is, the formation of soil) and agricultural production, and is also a characteristic of this area, was not seen. Moreover, the distribution of pits did not take into account the area occupied by various soils, which reflects that when we conducted soil surveys in the past, we did not consider the problem from the weight of various soils in production.

After the pit is dug well, observation and recording are required. Soviet experts are very serious when recording items, paying attention to combining production requirements. They record what they see, what it looks like, and always consider the requirements of production. For example, when he sees a sticky and hard layer of soil in the soil layer, he must see how thick and hard it is, and then consider the growth of plant roots and the problem of water permeability; when he sees alkali spots, he considers that the tractor should carry less plow when it is dry (because it is hard and not easy to plow), and be careful that the tractor gets stuck when it is wet.

After the profile is observed and recorded, the next step is to take soil samples. In the past, we often took soil samples according to the layers and depths predetermined in the house (how deep to how deep is a layer), and took one sample per layer in an egalitarian manner. Needless to say, this predetermined layer and depth is very unscientific, because it is not a requirement based on specific circumstances, and it is also wrong to take one sample per layer or only take one sample per layer. This time, the Soviet experts took two or even more soil samples from the topsoil that is closely related to production, and some other soil layers were sampled, while others were not.

The soil samples taken are used on the one hand for further research in the laboratory to confirm the observations in the field, and on the other hand for analysis. Which layers to analyze? What to analyze in which layer? Do all soil samples have to be analyzed together? In the past, we analyzed them all uniformly, and the analysis items were the same. This approach is time-consuming and costly, but it does not solve much problem. Today, Soviet experts have pointed out a correct method for us: to determine the analysis items according to the specific soil and production requirements. For example, there are more analysis items for the topsoil because it is more closely related to production, and there are fewer analysis items for other layers, and even the samples of some layers or the entire pit are not analyzed temporarily, and then analyzed when necessary. There are also some special soils like alkali spots, because they have a particularly large impact on production, and some special analysis items must be added.

Soviet experts pointed out a serious error in our soil analysis work in 1952: We did not study the swamp meadow soil, which occupies the largest area (more than 10,000 hectares) and has many problems, but focused on analyzing the leached black calcium soil, which occupies a small area (only more than 400 hectares) and has no production problems; we also lightly let go of the saline-alkali soil, which seriously affects production, and did not analyze it. The experts asked us very kindly: "You see, if we don't grasp the swamp meadow soil that is most closely related to production, what problems should we grasp?"

After the soil fieldwork was completed, we conducted visits to farmers with Soviet experts. Before this, I had racked my brains to consider an outline for "combining with production." Regarding cultivation and planting, there are: 1. What crops (including pasture) are there, their growth, growing season, production, existing problems, varieties, and the area they occupy; 2. What are the main crops lacking? Why? 3. The situation of grain supply and demand; 4. The problem of weeds; 5. The process and situation of cultivation. I felt that I had done my best, and the comrades in agriculture also felt that this was the case. However, after hearing the survey content proposed by Soviet experts, compared with the two, I clearly realized that the outline I drafted could be used anywhere, without combining the specific requirements of local production. How did the experts do it? First of all, he started from the several main soils here, such as swamp meadow soil, black calcium soil type meadow soil, and black calcium soil, to determine the items we want to investigate, because each investigation item such as land reclamation, cultivation, and even weeds and pests are related to various different soils. More importantly, focus on the following issues: understand the relationship between various wastelands (soils) and wheat, because producing wheat is the main production task of the Friendship Farm; understand the changes in rainwater and well water over the years, because the basic problem of swamp meadow soil, which occupies the largest area, is drainage; understand the impact of flat sowing and ridge cultivation on the growth and yield of various crops, because the habit here is ridge cultivation, and future mechanized cultivation is flat sowing. In general, all of them are centered around the production tasks of the Friendship Farm, and deeply and meticulously understand some specific and urgent problems. Not only that, the experts also pointed out that going to that village is mainly to understand those kinds of soils; those villages must be visited, and those villages can be omitted if there is no time.

Drawing a soil map is an important part of soil survey. It can reflect the soil type conditions and distribution of the site. With it, the site can be planned and utilized; agronomists can decide how to cultivate those lands and what crops to plant. Soviet experts told us: The quality of a soil map is not measured by the number of lines drawn on it, but by whether the agronomist can easily and solve production problems after receiving the map. How to determine the content of the soil map, which items must be drawn? Which ones do not have to be drawn? This still needs to be measured by the "production requirements" ruler.

Soviet experts once meaningfully criticized the soil map of the Sandao Gang area drawn in 1952, saying: "This map is sent to the Academy of Sciences, and it is useful as research data, but it is not useful for the farm's production!" It turned out that this soil map was quite complex. In addition to various soil types, there are more than 26 different items such as the thickness of the black soil layer, plants, drainage, slope, contour lines, etc. There are many and confusing items, but the main problems are not grasped, and it is difficult to understand. How did the Soviet experts revise it? The depth of the black soil layer can not be drawn on the map, because the black soil layer here is above 40 cm, and cultivation is not a problem. Since it is not a problem, why bother to draw it to increase the trouble? If the black soil layer is very thin, then it must be drawn so that agronomists can carefully consider this precious black soil when using this land. The plant growth situation does not need to be drawn, it is enough to write it in the manual. Because this is a farm that mainly produces grains, after land reclamation, no plants can be seen, and it must be drawn if it is a livestock farm. There is also no need to draw contour lines and slopes on the map, because the terrain here is flat; if it is used to solve the problem of drainage, the original contour lines are not enough, and a special topographic map needs to be drawn. Soviet experts also pointed out that in the Sandao Gang area, in addition to the main soil types, the following situations must be expressed: swamp (waterlogged land) should be drawn no matter how large or small; if the difference in soil moisture is large, it should also be drawn, because it affects the penetration of rainwater, the time of cultivation, and the quantity of cultivation; the area occupied by alkali spots here is not large, and they are scattered in a class of soil, but they have a greater impact on production and must be improved. Therefore, it must be marked with symbols on the soil map to attract the attention of agronomists.

The above-mentioned problems illustrate how Soviet experts permeate the "production requirements" into every specific work, and only in this way can we truly serve production. My personal feeling is that the most difficult thing is to melt the general requirements into every big and small specific work. In this regard, Soviet experts have set a good example for us.

A Soil Scientist is also a
      Work Organizer
Soviet experts have told us more than once that a soil scientist must also be an organizer; only in this way can he complete his work better and more effectively. Two years ago, Soviet genetic breeding expert Comrade Ivanov once told me that a professor must also be an organizer. I can understand this, because education work is facing the masses. How can a soil science worker also be an organizer? When it was brought up so seriously, I didn't quite understand it. After more than two months, I realized it from the work of the experts.

For any work, the expert has repeatedly researched and considered it before arranging it. From the nature and requirements of the work to what is needed, how many people are needed, and how to do it, all the way to what to do first and what to do later. His organization and arrangement can be just right, without waste, and without being hasty or perfunctory. Take the field survey as an example: on the night before leaving for the wilderness, he told us what to bring, where to go, how many routes to take, where that route starts, and where each route gathers to see the soil pits that have been dug in advance, and then return to the original route to carry out the work. In this way, the work efficiency is high and labor is saved.

The Soviet experts also paid close attention to the procedures of each work and the connection between the works. When arranging this work, they considered the previous work and the work after it. For example, when the experts took soil samples, they considered the heavy analysis work; when deciding what to analyze, they considered what method was most appropriate.

After returning from the field every day, the experts still organized the work of the day in the evening, using the results of this day's work to revise and determine the work of the next day, and using the previous work to guide the subsequent work. Experts always consider work from a comprehensive and developing perspective. The handling of the alkali spot problem is a good example. The area occupied by alkali spots here is not large, as mentioned earlier, they are only scattered in a type of soil, but the experts are very concerned about its development, whether it will expand after drainage in the future, and whether it will affect future production. Therefore, they suggested that it should be improved immediately, and further research should be done to see whether it will gradually shrink or expand after drainage and cultivation. The experts are also very concerned about the changes in the fertility of this fertile land after cultivation. Not only did they pay close attention to this issue during farmer visits, but they also suggested selecting land that has been cultivated for three to five years, land that has been cultivated for the longest time, and land that has just been reclaimed to study the changes in fertility after cultivation and the impact on yield. This will not only help our cultivation methods, but also have great guiding significance for other farms that will be established in nearby areas in the future.

Some problems that we have not thought of in the past have also been considered by Soviet experts. Soviet experts plan to save all the records of the soil pits, locations, and three-dimensional specimens of important soil pits, etc., so that if problems occur in the future and research is needed, there will be original specimens to check and specimens for analysis and comparison.

In these two months of selfless labor, the respected Soviet comrades not only helped us establish a new-style model large-scale grain farm, but also pointed out a bright road for our soil science workers to serve the construction of the motherland! Let us also thank them with practical actions and achievements!

    苏联专家为我们树立了土壤调查为农业生产服务的榜样
    国营友谊农场土地考查组组员  北京农业大学副教务长  孙渠
    我是一个土壤科学的工作者，几年以来，也在努力学习着苏联的先进土壤科学，却常常在某些关键性的问题上，苦于得不到解决。例如土壤科学怎样去为农业生产服务，就是其中最重要的一个问题。这次，在参加国营友谊农场勘查工作两个多月的时间里，从苏联专家的工作中，我才认识到了怎样才是一个先进的土壤科学工作者；更通过了一系列的具体工作，深深地体会到了先进的土壤科学是怎样和生产密切结合着的。
  怎样才是一个好的土壤科学
      工作者
    去年十一月中旬，一个晴朗的下午，地已经冻到半尺多深，草原上的冷风，吹透了人们的棉衣棉裤。我们土壤调查小组的苏联专家和中国同志在荒原上已经连续工作六、七个小时了，大家还一直没喝过一口水。这时，我们完成了一个土坑的观察，另一个新土坑还没挖好，苏联专家就抓紧这个空隙，亲切地给我们讲解了一课，主题是作为一个土壤学家，必须认识到自己对人民所负的重大责任。他斩钢截铁地说，“你既然是一个土壤学家，你就得告诉农业生产者，这块地应当种什么？怎样利用？不是你做你的土壤研究，他种他的地。你们的工作和农场工作是有密切关系的。”他的话是那样地恳切和充满着友爱，使我非常感动。解放了的这几年，我们是认识到了土壤科学必须为生产服务这一点的，而且也经常地拿它来教育学生；可是经过两个多月的田间工作，使我认识到了怎样才能真正做到为农业生产服务。为生产服务，并不只是工作的时候笼笼统统地想到它，也不是从屋子里走到地里，或只是在某些问题和方面上结合生产就对了；而是怎样把生产上的具体要求，渗透到每一件工作里，不管它是多么的细小。拿这两个多月的工作做例子，譬如说在黑龙江集贤县三道岗这一带的土地和自然条件下，要种“谷物”，一个土壤学家就要明确提出哪些地可以种，哪些地不可以种，哪些地经过怎样处理以后才可以种，应该怎样去利用这块地，才能完成国家交给农场的任务。
    苏联专家循循善诱地告诉我们：一个土壤学家，他是土壤的代言人；土壤不会说话，你是土壤学家，它就靠着你来替它说话。它能不能充分地发挥力量，靠你；能不能胜任交给它的任务也靠你。计划定了，将来出了问题，问题就在你——它的代言人。一个土壤学家也必须是一个土壤医生，必须关心土地的健康，了解它的痛苦，帮助农学家去医治好它的痛苦，使它为我们多打粮食。
  生产的要求决定着工作的每
      一个环节
    一九五二年，我国土壤工作者曾在三道岗一带做过一些调查。一九五二年的工作比解放以前的工作已提高了很多，但和今天由苏联专家指导和主持的这次土壤调查来比，却有着很大的不同。这里我只就工作中的几件比较重要的项目提出来谈谈：
    首先从挖坑来说。“挖坑”是研究土壤的基本手段（过去我国不少的土壤工作者并不是这样认识的）。苏联专家曾这样说过：“一个植物学家整天是植物标本、植物标本，一个土壤学家就是挖坑、挖坑。”只有凭借着对土坑的细致地观察和分析，才能看出一块土壤的来龙去脉，才能正确地抓住它的发生规律。
    但是挖坑也不是件容易的事，坑挖的不恰当，得出的结论还要害事。在什么地方挖坑，挖多少坑都要根据生产要求来确定。也就是说，观察了这些试坑，便要能够搞清土壤的生产利用情况，便要能告诉管理农场的同志们，哪些地能种什么，哪些不能种什么，和怎样才能种。一九五二年我们在这块土地上挖坑，挖的少还不说，而且挖得又小又浅。这样对决定土壤类型的重要根据之一——石灰质的反应，就没有抓住。和成土作用（即土壤的形成作用）、和农业生产最有关系的也是这个地区的特点的“地下水的深度”方面，也没有看出问题来。而且坑的分布，也没有很好地考虑到各种土壤所占的面积，这反映了我们过去进行土壤调查时，还没有从各种土壤在生产上所占的分量来考虑问题。
    坑挖好了以后，要进行观察和记载。苏联专家在记载项目的时候注意结合生产要求，十分认真。他们是有什么记什么，是什么样子记什么样子，并时刻考虑着生产上的要求。例如看到土层当中有一层粘硬的土时，一定要看它多厚，多硬，进而考虑到植物根群的生长和透水的问题；当他看到碱斑的时候，他就考虑到干的时候，拖拉机要少带犁（因硬不容易犁动），湿的时候当心拖拉机陷下去。
    剖面观察了，记载了，下一步工作就是采取土壤标本。过去我们采取土壤标本，往往是按照在屋子里预先定好的层次和深度（多深到多深是一层），平均主义地一层采取一个。不必说这种预先拟定的层次和深度是十分不科学的，因为那不是根据具体情况提出的要求，而一层必须采取一个或一层只采取一个也是不对的。这次苏联专家就把和生产有密切关系的表层，采取了两个土样或者更多些，其他土层有的采了，有的就没有采。
    采来的土壤标本，一方面为的是在室内再进行研究，肯定野外的观察，另一方面就是拿来分析。分析哪几层？哪层分析些什么？是不是所有的土壤标本都必须一起拿来分析？过去我们是千篇一律的都分析，分析的项目也是一样的。这样的做法，既费工夫，又花钱多，却没有解决多大的问题。今天苏联专家为我们指出了一个正确的方法：就是根据具体的土壤和生产上的要求确定分析项目。例如表土分析的项目就多，因为它更密切地关系着生产，其他层次分析的项目就少，甚至有的层次或整个坑的标本暂不分析，到有必要的时候再分析。也还有些特殊的土壤像碱斑，因为对生产的影响格外大，还必须加上一些特殊的分析项目。
    苏联专家曾一针见血地指出了我们一九五二年进行土壤分析工作中的一个严重错误：对于占面积最大（一万多公顷）、问题又多的沼泽化草甸土没有研究，却偏重地分析了面积既小（只有四百多垧）、生产上没有什么问题的淋溶黑钙土；对严重地影响生产的盐碱土也轻轻放过了，没有分析。专家很亲切地反问我们：“您看，和生产关系最大的沼泽化草甸土不抓，又应当抓什么问题呢？”
    土壤的野外工作完了以后，我们同苏联专家一起进行了对农民的访问。在这以前，我曾煞费脑筋地考虑了一个“结合生产”的提纲。关于耕作栽培方面，有：一、作物（包括牧草）有那些，生长的情况，生长期，生产的情况，存在的问题，品种和它们所占的面积；二、主要的作物缺少那些？为什么？三、粮食供需的情况；四、杂草的问题；五、耕作的过程和情况。我觉得我是尽了力了，农业方面的同志们也觉得就是这样了。但是，听到苏联专家所提出来的调查内容后，两者相较，使我清楚地觉察到：像我拟定的这个提纲，无论用到任何地方都可以，没有结合当地生产的具体要求。专家是怎样作的呢？首先他是从这里几种主要的土壤出发，如沼泽化草甸土、黑钙土型草甸土和黑钙土，来确定我们要调查的项目，因为每个调查的项目像开荒、耕作甚至杂草和病虫害等都是联系着各种不同的土壤的。更重要的是集中在下面的几个问题：了解各种荒地（土壤）和小麦的关系，因为生产小麦是友谊农场的主要生产任务；了解历年雨水和井水的变化情况，因为占面积最大的沼泽化草甸土的基本问题是排水；了解平播和起垅对于各种作物生长和产量的影响，因为这里的习惯是起垅，将来的机械耕作是平播。总起来说，都是围绕着友谊农场的生产任务，深入细致地了解一些具体而又迫切的问题。不但这样，专家还指出了到那个村子去，主要是为了了解那几种土壤；那几个村子一定要去，那几个村子没有工夫可以不去。
    绘制土壤图是土壤调查的一个重要部分。它可以把场地的土壤类型情况和分布反映出来，有了它，场地才能够进行规划和利用；农学家才能决定那些地怎样耕种，种些什么庄稼。苏联专家告诉我们：一张土壤图的好坏，不是从它上面画的线条的多少来衡量，而是在于农学家拿到这张图后，是不是又方便又能解决生产问题。怎样决定土壤图的内容，那些项目必须画上？那些不必画上？这依然要用“生产上的要求”这个尺子来衡量。
    苏联专家曾意味深长地批评一九五二年绘制的三道岗地区的土壤图说：“这张图送到科学院，作为研究的资料有些用处，对农场的生产没有用！”原来这张土壤图相当复杂，除了各种土壤类型以外，还有黑土层的厚薄、植物、排水、坡度、等高线等等二十六项以上各种不同项目，项目繁多纷乱，主要的问题却没有抓住，又令人很难看懂。苏联专家是怎样修正的呢？黑土层的深度可以不画在图上，因为这里的黑土层都是在四十公分以上，耕作不成问题。既然不成问题，又何必画上增加麻烦呢？如果是黑土层很薄，那就非画上不可，使农学家在利用这块地的时候，好好考虑这层宝贵的黑土。植物生长情况也不必画，写在说明书里就够了。因为这里是生产谷物为主的农场，开荒以后，什么植物都看不见，如是畜牧场则非画上不可。等高线和坡度也没有必要画在图上，因为这里的地形平坦；若是用它来解决排水的问题，原来的等高线也不够，而且需要画一张专门的地形图。苏联专家同时指出，在三道岗这个地区，除了主要的土类以外，下面的几个情况必须表达出来：沼泽地（积水地）不论大小都要画上；土壤的湿度若是差异大，也应画上，因为它影响着雨水的渗透，耕种的时间和耕作时的定量；碱斑在这里所占的面积不大，星星点点地分散在一类土壤里，但它对生产的影响较大，非注意改良不可，因之在土壤图上一定要用符号标出来，引起农学家的注意。
    从上面所谈到的这些问题，说明苏联专家是怎样把“生产的要求”渗透到每一件具体的工作里，也只有这样，才能真正地做到为生产服务。我个人的感觉，最不容易的地方，就是把总的要求融化在每一件大的小的具体工作里，这一点苏联专家为我们树立了良好的榜样。
    一个土壤学家同时也是一个
      工作组织者
    苏联专家不只一次地告诉过我们：一个土壤学家同时也必须是一个组织家；只有这样才能更好更有效地去完成他的工作。两年以前，苏联遗传选种专家伊万诺夫同志，曾经告诉过我，一个教授同时也必须是一个组织者。对于这一点，我还能够了解，因为教育工作，就是面向群众。怎么一个土壤科学工作者也必须是一个组织者呢？提的这样重，我就有些不大了解了。经过两个多月的时间，从专家们的工作当中我认识到了。
    任何一件工作，专家在布置以前，都反复的研究过，考虑过。从这项工作的性质和要求起，到需要什么，要多少人，怎样去做，一直细到先做什么，后做什么。他的组织和安排，能够恰到好处，不浪费，也不草率、苟且。就拿野外调查来说吧：在出发到荒原的头一天晚上，就告诉了我们，带些什么东西，到那儿去，分几路，那路从那里开始，走到什么地方的时候，各路集合到那里一起看预先挖好了的土坑，而后再各回原路进行工作。这样，工作效率既高，又节省了劳力。
    对各个工作的程序和工作之间的联系，苏联专家们也同样抓的很紧。在布置这项工作的时候，即考虑到前项工作，和它以后的工作，譬如专家在采土壤标本的时候，就考虑到繁重的分析工作；在决定分析什么的时候，就考虑到用什么方法最恰当。
    专家们每天从野外回来以后，晚上还在整理一天的工作，用这一天的工作结果，来修正和决定第二天的工作，用以前的工作来指导以后的工作。专家们考虑工作，总是从全面观点和发展观点来看问题。对碱斑问题的处理，就是一个很好的例子。碱斑在这里所占的面积并不大，前面说到过只是零零星星地分散在一类土中，专家却很关心它的发展，将来排水以后，经过耕种是不是会扩大，会不会影响到将来的生产。所以他们建议应当立即进行改良，同时还要做进一步的研究，看它经过排水耕种之后，还是日渐缩小呢？还是扩大？专家也很关心这块肥沃的土地，经过耕种以后肥力的变化。不但在农民的访问中密切的注意这个问题，而且也建议选择耕种过三、五年的地，耕种最久的地和刚开荒的地来做研究，看看进行耕作之后肥力的变化如何，对于产量的影响又如何。这样不但对于我们的耕作方法有所帮助，而且对今后在附近地区开办的其他农场，也有很大的指导作用。
    有的问题是我们过去没有想到的，苏联专家也考虑到了。苏联专家准备把所有的土坑的记载，位置，和重要土坑的立体标本等一切材料保存下来，准备将来一旦发生了问题，需要研究的时候，有原来的标本可查，也有标本可作分析比较。
    敬爱的苏联同志们在这两个多月的忘我劳动中，不仅帮助我们建立起了一个新式的模范的大型谷物农场，而且为我们土壤科学工作者指明了一条为祖国建设服务的光明大路！让我们也以实际的行动和成就来感谢他们吧！
