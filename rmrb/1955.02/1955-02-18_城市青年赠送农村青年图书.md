Youth League members and young people in factories, mines, enterprises, government agencies, and schools in Liaoning Province actively responded to the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Youth League's call to donate a book to rural youth. According to statistics from ten cities and twenty-five counties across the province, a total of 1,579,638 popular reading materials and comic books related to the lives, studies, and combat stories of the People's Liberation Army, current affairs policies, agricultural technology, sports and hygiene knowledge, and ideological cultivation of youth were donated to rural youth. These popular reading materials will allow each county to receive about 40,000 copies, and it is estimated that more than 3,000 rural libraries can be established throughout the province (each library containing 300 to 500 copies). Co-operative villages can achieve a library in every village.

The books donated by urban youth have been warmly welcomed by the vast number of rural youth. When the donated books were distributed to the countryside, rural youth held grand acceptance meetings and established "Youth Libraries." Xinjin County has already distributed the first batch of donated books to the countryside and established ninety-five youth libraries. The Youth League Committee of Tai'an County has established a total of twenty-five youth libraries and eight mobile library stations in key villages throughout the county, so that rural youth in the county have the opportunity to read these donated books.

Rural youth have enthusiastically written letters thanking urban youth for their concern and expressed their intention to actively participate in mutual aid and cooperation, learn culture well, do a good job in agricultural production, and vigorously support socialist industrialization. Through donating books, the Youth League members and young people of the spinning factory of Shenyang Textile Factory have established a deep friendship with the Youth League members of Huijiatun in Gaiping County and other places. They correspond frequently and encourage each other.

    城市青年赠送农村青年图书
    辽宁省各厂矿企业、机关、学校中的青年团员和广大青年积极响应青年团辽宁省委员会赠送农村青年一本书的号召，据全省十个市和二十五个县统计，共赠送农村青年有关解放军生活、学习、战斗故事，时事政策，农业技术，体育卫生常识，青年思想修养等方面的通俗读物和连环画等一百五十七万九千六百三十八册。这批通俗读物，一个县可分到四万册左右，全省预计可建立三千个以上的农村图书室（每个图书室以三百册至五百册计算），合作化的村可以做到村村有图书室。
    城市青年赠送的书，受到了农村广大青年的热烈欢迎。赠书发到农村时，农村青年都召开了隆重的接受赠书大会，并成立了“青年图书室”。新金县已将第一批赠书发到农村，建立了九十五个青年图书室。青年团台安县委员会在全县重点村共建立了二十五个青年图书室和八个图书流动站，使全县农村青年都有机会阅读这批赠书。
    农村青年都热情地写信感谢城市青年对他们的关怀，并表示要积极参加互助合作，学好文化，搞好农业生产，大力支援社会主义工业化。沈阳纺织厂纺纱工厂的青年团员和青年通过赠书，已和盖平县惠家屯等地青年团支部的青年团员建立了深厚的友谊，他们经常通信，互相鼓舞。
