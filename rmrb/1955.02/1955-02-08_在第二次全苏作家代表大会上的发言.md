Speech at the Second All-Union Congress of Soviet Writers
Soviet Union Ya. Fadeyev

    Dear comrades and friends!

    Far back in the conditions of bourgeois society, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin had an ideal: "To oppose truly free literature, openly linked with the proletariat, to literature that pretends to be free but is in fact linked with the bourgeoisie." At that time, Lenin wrote:

  “This will be free literature because it will not be greed or ambition, but socialist ideas and sympathy for the working people that will gather new forces into its ranks. This will be free literature because it will not be serving sated ladies, not serving the bored and fat 'upper ten thousand', but serving the millions of working people. These working people are the cream of the country, the strength of the country, the future of the country.”

    We have the right to say that now, when our country has built a socialist society, Lenin's principle of truly free literature, openly linked with the people, has been realized in its most complete and fullest form. The ideas of communism and unwavering loyalty to the people are recruiting new forces to join the ranks of Soviet literature. Soviet literature is created for millions of people, created by people from among the people, and it reflects the life of the people under new living conditions.

    We do not yet have the right to say that our literature has reached the level of greatness of the people's cause, but we have the right to say that it serves the people with unwavering loyalty, and it has created and continues to create a continuous stream of artistic treasures, which can be regarded as a new step in the development of human art.

    In the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Communist Party to our congress, in this excellent document that puts forward new and important tasks for us, it is said that the achievements of Soviet literature since the First Congress are great.

  “There are many literary works that truthfully reflect the enthusiasm for building socialism, the unparalleled feats of the Soviet patriotic people during the difficult years of the Great Patriotic War, and the labor heroism of our people in the post-war economic recovery.”

    On the other hand, the congratulatory message from the Central Committee states: "Our literature still lags far behind the booming life and the demands of readers who have improved politically and culturally."

    I think it is necessary to quote these words from the congratulatory message about the achievements and backwardness of our literature, because only by examining the state of our literature in this way can it be truthful and objective.

    Our congress is being conducted under the sign of profound and serious criticism and self-criticism. The country has entered a period of completing the construction of socialism and gradually transitioning from socialism to communism. The international and human significance of the labor of Soviet writers has grown so much. It is completely reasonable and natural for writers to express dissatisfaction with the results of their labor under such conditions.

    In one part of my speech, I would also like to critically review the development path we have taken. However, I still have the right to disagree with those individual writers who want to see the development of Soviet literature in recent years as almost completely "backward".

    I have been working in Soviet literature for more than thirty years, and like many of my contemporary writers, I have heard this kind of grumbling more than once. When the country transitions to a new and higher stage of development, and the rapid development of our life particularly clearly shows that the great life of the people is not reflected widely and fully enough in literary works, then you always hear individuals shouting that literature seems to be "declining". In fact, literature is developing, growing, encompassing all new areas of life, and the number of writers who are capable of solving complex artistic tasks is constantly increasing.

    We can recall the era of the First Five-Year Plan. If you look at some magazine articles at the time, you might think that the development of literature was stagnant. But it was during this First Five-Year Plan era that we had works such as Sholokhov's "Virgin Soil Upturned", Tolstoy's "Peter the Great", Leonov's "Sot’", Katayev's "Time, Forward!", Panferov's "Bruski", Ilyin's "The Story of the Great Plan", Shaginyan's "Hydrocentral", and Ehrenburg's "The Second Day".

    Just think, in the last year and a half alone, there have been published: Leonov's "Russian Forest", Gladkov's "Arduous Years", Grossman's "For a Just Cause", some works that can be regarded as outstanding phenomena in Russian prose. There have also been published such good books as Zhukovsky's "Baltic Skies", Granin's "The Seekers", Kazakevich's "The Heart of a Friend", Nikolaeva's "The Story of the Tractor Station Director and the Chief Agronomist" and Ovechkin's "Essays". (Applause)

    Most of these works are new. The novel "For a Just Cause" and the novella "The Heart of a Friend" were both revised by the authors after criticism. Now these books have the right to occupy a place among the excellent works of the past year. (Applause)

    I have only mentioned eight works from the most recent period. No writer with artistic sympathy and a noble attitude towards literature can deny that the works I mentioned – although they also have individual shortcomings – have opened up new areas of life and human relationships, and are truly meaningful literary works. We must see the living process of literary development and not force it into general formulas.

    Literature lags behind life. Yes, this is true if you compare the entire scale of the people's achievements with everything we have created. But Soviet literature is strong precisely because, whether in the past, present or future, it always has many old and young writers who are sensitive to new things – and their number is constantly increasing – who are opening up all new aspects of life before us, and who are capable of solving huge artistic tasks.

    Writers do not study life enough. Yes, this is true for many of us. But if many writers are not familiar with life and do not study life, how can they create dozens of excellent works, many of which have become the glory and pride of Soviet literature?

    Writers have not fully mastered artistic skills. How true this is for so many of us! But we must never forget that Soviet literature has provided a large number of outstanding masters of prose, poetry and drama, and they write not only in Russian, but also in the languages of our various nationalities.

    Many young writers can be named who have a keen sense of beauty and a serious attitude towards their literary work.

    It is too naive for many of our writers to try to explain and defend their weaknesses with the "theory of no conflict". Some writers are too lazy to delve into the lives of Soviet people, where the struggle between the old and the new is vigorously taking place in all aspects of life. In many cases, writers have also made such efforts, but because they have not grasped the world view that helps them observe the true truth of life, they cannot distinguish between events, between human relationships, and they cannot see clearly the development path of new and advanced things in life. Therefore, they do not dare to attack the remnants of the old private world in people's minds, or more often, they see these things, but they have not mastered the forms of expressing life conflicts. So he goes to the podium and says: "The infamous 'theory of no conflict' prevented me from writing." (Applause) Alas, does this "theory" exist?

    There are also some writers and critics who try to determine these weaknesses of many of our writers with the formula of "should write like this", but this is not yet a "theory", and it still needs to be improved to reach the level of theory.

    If this "theory" exists, it was exposed as early as three years ago. But why is the progress in our drama creation still so small? No, obviously the problem is not in the "theory". Can you imagine Leonov writing novels and plays without conflict? If our excellent writers, poets and playwrights do not understand that most works of various literary genres are based on conflict, how can they create excellent works of Soviet prose, poetry and drama?

    No, comrades, let's not use any book "theory" to defend our weaknesses.

    If in our publishing houses and leading organs managing art and literature, including the Writers' Association, there are people – and there probably still are such people – who, due to backwardness and conservatism, have promoted and are still promoting this tendency to embellish reality, not to talk about contradictions and the difficulties of growth, – this, like all aspects of life, is also a manifestation of the struggle between the old and the new in literature. Writers who are not good at using their pens to fight against the old things in life and affirm and promote the new things are surrendering to these phenomena in literature and art. The people who become the flowers and strength of literature are outstanding precisely because they can go deep into life in the attitude of warriors wherever there is a struggle between the old and the new. The works loved by the people belong to such writers.

    Comrades! We understand that the main aspect of free literature is that our writers, whether they are party members or non-party members, openly recognize the leading role of the Communist Party in all aspects of life and in literary work.

    Bourgeois writers are subordinate to bourgeois parties headed by financial and industrial bosses, and to their publishing houses and newspapers. The non-partisanship of the bourgeoisie is hypocritical.

    Our Communist Party is the product of our people, the best, most advanced, most conscious, and most organized part of our people. Soviet literature is inspired by the great ideas of the Party.

    The party spirit of Soviet literature is not a special phenomenon possessed only by a few party member writers. This is the historical essence of our Soviet literature. Of course, we have enemies, ideological dissidents. Some excellent writers have also made mistakes in their creations and deviated from the party spirit. But when we talk about the party spirit of Soviet literature, we are referring to the historical fact that Soviet writers, whether they are party members or non-party members, recognize that the ideas of the Communist Party are correct, and they defend these ideas in their creations. Therefore, it is natural that they also recognize the Party's leading role in literary work.

    Here, a historically new type of writer is being formed and is constantly being formed – a conscious fighter for communism.

    I say "constantly being formed" because life is constantly moving forward, and it constantly requires new and newer qualities from Soviet writers.

    The congratulatory message from the Central Committee talks about what kind of writers we need: "The Soviet people hope to see their writers as active, in-depth participants in life and enthusiastic fighters who help the people build a new society, in which all sources of social wealth will flow like torrents, and in which new people who have psychologically broken away from the remnants of capitalism will be constantly produced."

    With the power of strong truth, the congratulatory message talks about the competition between socialism and capitalism that is taking place on an increasingly broad international stage, and about the aggressive and reactionary classes who are trying to use violence to stop the growth of socialist forces.

    In our Soviet writers, the Party sees warriors who defend the great humanitarian ideas and oppose imperialist ideas, and warriors who defend the peaceful friendship of all nationalities. The Party tells us what kind of spiritual power our literature will become when it struggles with the remnants of capitalism in people's minds. The Party reminds us that the social transformation and educational role of Soviet literature is greatly enhanced. The Party reminds us:

  “The mission of our literature is not only to reflect new things, but also to do its best to help new things win.”

    The reason why our literature has many shortcomings is indeed because many writers are not familiar with life, are detached from life, or are too lazy to study life, but we should observe life with the eyes of enthusiastic fighters for communism.

    Regarding the discussion about lyric poetry that unfolded before the congress, I personally tend to support Olga Bergholz, (applause) based on what I just said. Not only in the field of lyric poetry, but in all fields of artistic creation, writers should completely put themselves, their thoughts and feelings, their love for our Soviet people and hatred for our enemies, and their passion for hating all conservative and backward things that hinder our progress, into the cause of understanding and reflecting life. Whatever the writer says, whatever aspect of life he reflects, he should put his own experiences into it all. (Applause)

    Such a view of literature not only does not contradict the Marxist-Leninist view of literature that reflects objective reality, but on the contrary, only from such a standpoint can we correctly understand life and arouse true feelings in people's hearts. (Applause)

    I support the call made by writer Ovechkin from the congress podium: "Get closer to life!" I even agree with his opinion that all regions of our vast country are waiting for writers in this way and loving writers in this way. Therefore, it is beneficial for many writers to live and work in various places. However, the question is not who lives where. Writers who love life and have the enthusiasm of warriors can find new things in life anytime and anywhere under the urging of their hearts. (Applause)

    In this regard, I would like to say a few friendly words to Valentin Ovechkin, hoping that he will not show off his knowledge of life to his other colleagues. (Applause)

    We know that Ovechkin has a close connection with collective farm life, so we respect him very much. At present, he still appears among us as a positive character in literature. But if he starts to "activate" his image to the point of turning it upside down, he will ruin himself.

    Now let's talk about the debate about lyric poetry. I advise Olga Bergholz to abandon the term "self-expression". This word has no meaning in Russian. Probably for this reason, it was used by all kinds of decadents in those years.

    It is said that Olga Bergholz quoted Belinsky incorrectly in the debate. Oh, that's okay! Let knowledgeable people choose more appropriate quotations to express Bergholz's correct ideas. Is the problem in the quotation? (Applause)

    It is impossible to describe our outstanding Soviet people, talk about our socialist life, and talk about the things that hinder its progress without individuality. Soviet writers are people who are full of ardent love for our people and for our entire life. At a meeting, writer Katayev said very correctly that our literature cannot be divided into "collective farm" literature, "production" literature, or literature depicting intellectuals. At that time, Katayev said that the reason why classical literature is excellent is because it describes the society of that time. Our literature should also be literature describing Soviet society.

    This does not mean that writers cannot reflect the aspects of life they are more familiar with, express the social classes they are more familiar with, and the people of the occupations they prefer. But true talent and true artistic skills lie first of all in being good at loving everything, loving all new things – new things in all aspects of our life – and being good at reflecting everything that writers encounter in life.

    This kind of love will open all the doors for writers and will show them all the conflicts of life. In this way, the tedious debate about what scale to use to measure the positive and negative characters in the work will never happen again.

    We cannot but talk about the positive and negative images in literature, because in life the forces of the new world and the old world are not without individuality. They are embodied in living people. Our writers not only describe people, but also give them moral judgments.

    Ehrenburg said very rightly: "Heroism, creative passion, love for the people, and the struggle against selfishness, indifference and conservatism are now taking place in the minds and hearts of many people. Here is where the new things fight against the shadows of the past, and good fights against evil."

    We should understand that people are not standing still. They are constantly growing, constantly being educated and transformed by our society.

    The world view from the standpoint of a writer, a conscious communist fighter, tells the writer with the material of life itself how and in what form the new and old things are manifested in people.

    From the standpoint of a warrior writer, the debate about how many positive characters there should be in Soviet satire and whether satirical works with only negative characters can be written is also tedious.

    In the genre of satire, as in everything else, there is also a character – perhaps this is the most important, that is, the author himself. Our satirical literature, like the satirical literature of our great predecessors, is first of all humanitarian. If a writer loves our new life and exposes all hostile and conservative things that resist it in order to affirm and develop it, he can always find forms to express his love and hatred. We must not forget that in various genres of satirical literature, this aspect of the problem can be solved in different ways.

    The congratulatory message from the Central Committee reminds us that Soviet literature and Soviet writers have grown and been tempered in the struggle against alien influences, against bourgeois ideology and manifestations of capitalist remnants. Yes, we have grown and been nurtured under the conditions of struggle. It is incorrect not to see that although the forms of struggle are changing, the struggle is still going on.

    Of course, in our literature, bourgeois nationalists, cosmopolitans, and supporters of "art for art's sake" are no longer so powerful, but their ideas still reflect the imperialist ideas that are hostile to us. Aggressive and reactionary classes want to use violent methods to stop the growth of socialism and suppress the desire of all nationalities to get rid of capitalist exploitation and colonial oppression. They are trying to cultivate and vigorously support various manifestations of bourgeois ideology in our country. We must all remember that the struggle we have waged for many years against manifestations of nationalism and cosmopolitanism, against vulgarization, lack of ideology, and decadent tendencies is a just struggle. If we do not continue this struggle resolutely, our ideological enemies will cause great damage to the development of Soviet literature.

    The representatives of these ideas that are hostile to us have caused great disasters, but it is too naive to think that these ideas no longer exist. No, we now and in the future will have conflicts with the resurgence of these alien ideas.

    The mistakes made by the editorial department of the "New World" magazine, which became the object of discussion and was condemned by the Soviet literary community in the months before the congress, can be regarded as the most typical example of this ideological manifestation.

    I would like to return to the so-called "sincerity in literature" issue announced in the "New World" magazine.

    True literature cannot but be sincere and upright. This does not even need to be mentioned in student homework, just as it is not necessary to prove that water is wet.

    However, there have been some periods in the development of our Russian social life when literature has faced this problem. Everyone knows that Chernyshevsky has an excellent essay "On Sincerity in Criticism". Anyone who has carefully read this essay will immediately see that although it comprehensively touches on the issue of artistry, it has a political nature.

    In this essay, the revolutionary democrat Chernyshevsky, as the representative of the people oppressed under the Tsarist system, exposes the erroneous anti-people ideas reflected in the works of sometimes even very famous writers, and refutes the liberal critics of the bourgeois landlords, because these critics are encouraging, supporting and rendering these erroneous anti-people ideas, they are deceiving the people and adapting to the Tsarist system.

    It can be seen that this request to express opinions on issues that seem clear to everyone has a political nature for Chernyshevsky.

    Sometimes we can still encounter shoddy and conformist people in our literature – this is the mildew of our society. But there are more people in our literature who are inexperienced in art. They often cannot find ways to express their thoughts and feelings, which are not only sincere, but also produced by their entire lives and filled with a passion for loving the people. Soviet writers and all the people fought together for the victory of the socialist system in our country. They went through the most difficult stages of building a new, just and reasonable society with the Party and the people. They shed blood on the battlefield, defending the socialist motherland and attacking the enemy. In their view, everything created in our country is imprinted with the labor of their parents, brothers and sisters, and even children – only a crazy vulgar person would say that these Soviet writers are not sincere, and would say that you and I, who have dedicated our lives to the cause of fighting for communism, are not sincere. (Applause)

    As everyone can see, the author of this essay also requires expressing opinions in this regard with a political nature: hoping that the great Soviet literature will abandon the communist ideas that inspire it and become a conductor of alien ideas.

    At the congress, various criticisms of the leadership of the Writers' Association can be heard. Most of these criticisms are correct. However, I want to say very firmly that the leadership of the Writers' Association has done a great thing for Soviet literature. It exposed and explained the ideological errors of the editorial department of the "New World" magazine to the literary community.

    Some comrades – not many – have forgotten that the ideological struggle in literature is still going on, and there are still forces opposing us. When examining the reasons that hinder our literature from developing more rapidly and fully, this issue cannot be ignored, that is, the issue of our humanitarian ideas fighting against the misanthropic imperialist ideas, because this struggle is taking place throughout our entire planet, within all countries and continents, and the opposition to us within our country is only a reaction to this struggle of worldwide historical significance.

    In my opinion, every upright Soviet writer who is loyal to the Soviet system, when criticizing our own shortcomings and faults, should not only proceed from loving our common cause, but also from respecting himself, and should determine his attitude towards the ideological enemies of Soviet literature and the hostile forces opposing Soviet literature in front of the writer and in front of the people – especially at such a time, when he is speaking as a Soviet writer from the high podium of the Soviet Writers' Congress.

    Every Soviet writer cherishes the fraternal status and honor of the Soviet Union. When he does not talk about the ideological enemies of Soviet literature, but completely concentrates his criticism on those aspects of life that can be decided by ourselves and criticizes them to the fullest extent, he does not realize that he is leaving loopholes for the enemy to sneak into him.

    I have carefully listened to the criticisms of Ovechkin, Aliger, Bergholz, and Kaverin, and I found that there are many correct points in their criticisms, which I will talk about below. But I think that if these writers also thought of what I just said, the gains from their speeches would be even greater.

    I have carefully read the shorthand record of Mikhail Sholokhov's speech, and I can also say these words to him.

    A writer, a conscious and enthusiastic fighter for communism, should always see his main ideological enemy first. He should settle accounts with him first. This will only make him more powerful when criticizing those problems that can be decided by ourselves and can be corrected by us. (Applause) This applies even more fairly to Mikhail Sholokhov, because he is a great writer in our country. The people's love for him is infinite. His prestige is very high. He himself can do a lot to correct the shortcomings in the development of our entire literary cause. (Applause) It is a pity that he used his speech to make personal attacks – this is not serious.

    The comrades mentioned above are all good Soviet writers. I want to advise them: "Thank you for your criticisms, but please think a little more about your speeches at the congress. Maybe you will finally agree with me that there are great problems in these speeches."

    The congratulatory message from the Central Committee made some lofty remarks about the mission of Soviet literature: "Soviet literature, as the most advanced literature in the world, has the mission of serving the cause of the working people and reaching the highest peak of world artistic creation." In order to reach the highest peak of world artistic creation, we should study, study more, and study comprehensively. I want to say again and again that our classical heritage – Russian, the literature of our brother nationalities, and the literature of the whole world – is the best art school for Soviet writers.

    The great Lenin said that we should critically accept and sort out all the essence that mankind has created in its entire development process.

    I want to warn that in accepting the old classical heritage, we must prevent the vulgarized views that were once popular. We often encounter such an argument that Soviet literature only inherits the realistic art of the past.

    Some literary figures believe that there was a realistic people's art in the past that we now inherit, and there was also an anti-realistic anti-people's art that only belonged to the so-called bourgeoisie. For example, in the article "Aesthetic Issues and Soviet Literature" published in the "Truth" newspaper on September 16 this year, A. Sobolev expressed such a view. He wrote: "The reactionary class used to support and still supports anti-realistic anti-people's art. The working class stepped onto the stage of historical struggle... and appeared as active fighters to defend true realistic art."

    When I was young, I also supported such views, and even wrote an essay "Down with Schiller!" (Laughter) After some time, I realized that Soviet literature should completely inherit everything advanced and progressive that mankind has created in its past development. Of course, this advanced and progressive thing is indeed often manifested in realistic art, but it is foolish to abandon Schiller from our classical heritage. This is especially true for romantic writers like Victor Hugo. In the Central Book Distribution Bureau, Fedin and I saw some materials. The total number of copies of Hugo's works published in our country is 8.5 million, exceeding the 2.5 million copies of Balzac's works, and the number of copies of Maupassant's works is 3 million, exceeding the number of copies of Zola's works by more than one time.

    Why is it important to talk about this now? Because critically accepting the wealth of classical literary forms can promote the richness and diversity of socialist realism forms. (Applause)

    Samed Vurgun said very rightly: The mission of socialist realism is not to impoverish the forms of world literature, but to enrich them.

    The great Lenin, who put forward the principle of the party spirit of literature, instructed:

  “There is no need to argue that in this cause it is absolutely necessary to ensure a vast world of personal creativity and personal preferences, and a vast world of ideas and fantasies, forms and contents.”

    The congratulatory message from the Central Committee also said: "Socialist realism makes it possible to develop extensive creative initiative and to choose various creative forms and styles according to the writer's own preferences and interests."

    From this point of view, I want to support the opinion expressed by Surkov and Simonov in the report, that is, within our socialist realism, there are in fact various creative schools in terms of form and style, and in the future these schools will continue to develop and compete. It is very harmful if writers belonging to different schools, whose creations are developed on the general principles of socialist realism, conclude that they must form themselves organizationally. This is harmful because strict boundaries cannot be drawn between these schools, and any attempt to draw such boundaries will only create a narrow sectarian style.

    We must remember that there is often a transition from one form and style to another in terms of form and style. Some poets use all the wealth of forms they can use in their creations. As long as it is not imitation, this is the manifestation of the poet's artistic skills. In the past, in our poetry, the great Pushkin provided a great example. We are all familiar with how rich the forms of poetic expression Vladimir Mayakovsky possessed.

    I think that the advantage of Surkov's report is his understanding of the diversity of forms and styles of Soviet literature within socialist realism. From this meaning, it is even beneficial for Surkov to cite so many different names. We should think that we often forget this side of the problem. This report is objective, and such a report is what our Soviet literature needs most now.

    From the criticisms received by the Writers' Association and its elected organs, it can be clearly seen how high the writers expect from their association and the leading organs after the congress.

    The Central Committee in its congratulatory message highly valued the role that the Writers' Association should play in solving the tasks facing Soviet literature. The Writers' Association for twenty years, the congratulatory message said, "has grown into a powerful mass organization that unites all the creative forces of party member and non-party member writers, based on the principle of collective leadership."

    The Council of the Writers' Association has summed up twenty years of work. During this period, the people who directly participated in the work of the Presidium of the Council and the Secretariat of the Council have changed many times, and many new writers have been added to the Council in the form of elections in these twenty years.

    The writers hope that the Writers' Association will not undermine the principles of Soviet democracy in the future, and hope that the Writers' Congress will be convened as scheduled within the period stipulated in the charter. They also hope that the Council, Presidium and Secretariat of the Writers' Association will also work regularly, and hope that the election system will be maintained for all organs of the Writers' Association from top to bottom, instead of using the method of election. (Applause)

    The reason for many shortcomings and errors in the work of the Writers' Association is that the principle of collective leadership of the Writers' Association has not always been observed in the past twenty years. Sometimes, individual leaders of the Writers' Association have concentrated too much power. The writers hope to ensure true collective leadership in the association, and hope that a broader presidium will exercise full power to solve the problems in the work of the Writers' Association during the recess of the plenary session of the Council. They also hope that the Secretariat of the Writers' Association will also become an organ responsible to the Council and the Presidium.

    However, Semyon Kirsanov vaguely expressed an opinion in his speech. He believed that the function of the Secretariat is almost a technical function. It is necessary to oppose this understanding of the Secretariat.

    It is also incorrect for some people to think that a presidium and secretariat that satisfy everyone in the world can be set up. We must strive to ensure that the presidium and secretariat truly fulfill their responsibilities to the writers, and at the same time exercise the power of the organs elected by them, and guide all the ideological and artistic work of the Writers' Association in the struggle against alien ideas and in defending the noble moral qualities of Soviet writers.

    The writers hope to respect criticism and self-criticism from bottom to top in their social creative organizations. The writers hope that the form of free creative discussion will become the basic form for clarifying ideological and creative problems. However, Margarita Aliger's understanding of broad creative discussions expressed at the congress cannot be agreed with. She said that discussion, "if you believe in the detailed explanation of the Russian language, means a discussion of a dispute issue with the purpose of clarifying various different views, without the need for an organ willing to decide that these different views are wrong to make a summary." This cannot be agreed with, because it is meaningless to only clarify various different views in the discussion. Various different views will not all be correct. There is an old joke: "If you choose from two evils, then even one incorrect view is stronger than two correct views."

    We rely on the social science of Marxism-Leninism. According to this science, objective truth exists and can be clearly recognized. The reason why broad and free creative discussions are needed is to compare various different views, and then find objective truth from them, make it the wealth of all writers as much as possible, and rely on the truth discovered in this way to move forward and achieve new achievements.

    However, one opinion is correct, that is, it is incorrect to regard one's own views as a conclusion that everyone must agree with, force others to accept one's own views, and ignore collective opinions in free and broad creative discussions. The main function of our Writers' Association is the function of ideological and artistic education. Therefore, we are concerned about making the truth thoroughly clear in collective discussions and making it understood by everyone. Therefore, from this point of view, creative discussions should be prepared collectively and conducted collectively.

    Therefore, I want to say a few words about the role and position of our significant Soviet publications in evaluating literary phenomena.

    Needless to say, our publications have played a great role in the development of Soviet literature. They truly estimate the phenomena of Soviet literature, help writers identify their own mistakes, and point out the path of literary development. It is not permissible to make judgments and verdicts on literary phenomena without allowing people to defend themselves, but this kind of situation sometimes occurs in our publications. (Applause)

    Of course, if the publications do not help Soviet writers and the entire Soviet society to expose alien and hostile things and correct these or those serious mistakes in time, they have not completed their tasks. But in the vast majority of cases, the Soviet literary phenomena that Soviet publications come into contact with are created by upright Soviet writers with different personal creative faces and different characteristics. In most cases, it is better for publications to understand social opinion, the opinions of writers and readers about the work in advance. No matter how good the editorial department is, it should not take the power to decide the fate of the work into its own hands.

    It should be estimated that the masses and Soviet social opinion are very trusting of our publications.

    For example, everyone knows that writer Grossman made truly serious mistakes in his novel "For a Just Cause". Our publications were the first to make deviations in criticizing these mistakes. Therefore, such an atmosphere was created around this novel in a part of Soviet social opinion and within the Writers' Association that made us, who did not see Grossman's mistakes, have to bear sins that were actually greater than the mistakes made by the author and the mistakes made by us. Of course, this cannot defend us in any way. I still feel very sorry that when I expressed my opinion on the novel, I seemed very cowardly. I supported the just criticism of the novel, but did not oppose the deviations in the criticism. I called this novel an ideologically harmful work. (Applause)

    To some extent, I corrected this mistake of mine. I worked with the military publishing house to help Grossman revise this novel until the novel basically corrected the main mistakes and was published. (Applause)

    The writers hope that the Writers' Association and its new leadership will cure the "childhood diseases" of some of our colleagues – sectarianism. This "childhood disease" of sectarianism has not been properly attacked in recent years, and we, who have been in the leading position of the Writers' Association for a long time, are responsible to some extent.

    The work in the ideological and artistic education of writers is very poor, and there is a lack of broad creative life in the Writers' Association. Therefore, it has promoted the development of this unprincipled sectarianism. However, it should be said that the majority of the members of the Writers' Association, especially the leading cadres of our literary community, especially the old writers and our youngest writers, have not committed this problem.

    The harm of sectarianism lies in the fact that it puts personal and sectarian factors into the matter of estimating literary phenomena, hinders objective criticism of these phenomena, and destroys the natural comradeship between writers. Although the creative styles of writers are different, they all stand on a common ideological position. The main harm of this is that the writers entangled in sectarianism often put political hats on their so-called "enemies." (Applause)

    At this congress, a lot of, and often correct, criticism has been made of the work of the Writers' Association. But writers should know that there are many mistakes and distortions in criticizing the ideological positions of writers and criticizing works, and sectarianism has played a very bad role in this regard.

    The staff of our newspaper editorial departments must understand that some writers in our literary community are still suffering from this "childhood disease" of sectarianism. They must estimate that these representatives of Soviet literature, who are not very numerous, may be not objective in publishing critical articles in the newspaper, and must be carefully examined.

    On the other hand, we are very clear that most of the people who commit this problem are actually upright Soviet writers, and are often very good, even very good. We should tell them very frankly that they should get rid of their "childhood diseases" as soon as possible, because this problem only benefits the enemies of Soviet literature. Their responsibility, the responsibility of Soviet writers, conscious fighters for the cause of communism, is to think about this carefully and draw sincere principled conclusions from within.

    Dear comrades and friends! We are fortunate to engage in creative work in a country where social oppression and national oppression have disappeared forever. We are building a new world where human relations are very reasonable. We are surrounded by the love of the great Soviet people. People who dedicate all their energy to the cause of transforming and decorating the motherland for the happiness of all mankind have become the heroes of our works. Our Gorky's words have never sounded so powerfully: How proud the word man sounds.

    We have taken over the humanitarian relay baton from the hands of past generations, and history has entrusted us with the sacred responsibility of sending it to the bright communist future. Time has put before us the worldwide historical task of the communist education and transformation of people. What could be more glorious than this responsibility?

    We are not acting alone now. We have many colleagues and allies. Some are united with them by the common ideas of defending peace and peaceful coexistence. Some are united with them by the demands of maintaining democratic freedom and national independence. Some are close to us because of the same path of development.

    We can fully say that all honest and living things – this is what every nation

### 在第二次全苏作家代表大会上的发言

    在第二次全苏作家代表大会上的发言
    苏联  亚·法捷耶夫亲爱的同志们和朋友们！
    远在资产阶级社会的条件下，弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁就有了一个理想：“使真正自由的、和无产阶级公开联系着的文学去对抗假装自由的而事实上和资产阶级联系着的文学。”那时候列宁写道：
  “这将是自由的文学，因为不是贪欲也不是野心，而是社会主义思想和对劳动人民的同情将招集一批又一批新的力量到它的队伍里来。这将是自由的文学，因为它将不是替饱食终日的贵妇人服务，不是替百无聊赖和胖得发愁的‘几万上等人’服务，而是替千千万万劳动人民服务。这些劳动人民是国家的精华、国家的力量、国家的未来。”
    我们有权利说，现在当我国建成了社会主义社会，列宁的这个真正自由的、和人民公开联系着的文学的原则以最完整和充分的形式实现了。共产主义的思想和对人民忠贞不渝的思想，正在征集一批又一批的新生力量加入苏联文学的行列。苏联文学是为千千万万人创造的，是从人民中间来的人们所创造的，它反映着人民在新的生存条件下的生活。
    我们还没有权利说，我们的文学达到了像人民的事业那末伟大的水平，但是我们有权利说，它是赤胆忠心地为人民服务的，它已经创造了而且还在创造连绵不断的艺术珍品，这些艺术珍品可以算做是人类艺术发展中新的一步。
    在共产党中央委员会给我们大会的祝词里，在这个向我们提出了新的重大任务的卓越文件里说，第一次代表大会以来苏联文学的成就是很大的，
  “有不少的文学作品真实地反映了建设社会主义的热情，反映了苏联爱国人民在伟大的卫国战争的艰难年月中的无可比拟的功勋，以及我们人民在战后经济恢复中的劳动英雄主义。”
    另一方面，中央委员会的祝词里说：“我们的文学还大大落后于蓬勃发展着的生活，落后于在政治上和文化上已经提高了的读者的要求。”
    我认为必须引述祝词里谈到我们文学的成就和落后的这几句话，因为只有这样考察我们文学的状况，才是真实和客观的。
    我们的大会是在深刻而严肃的批评和自我批评的标志之下进行的。国家进入了完成社会主义建设而从社会主义逐步过渡到共产主义的时期，苏联作家劳动的国际意义和全人类意义有了这么多的增长，作家对于他们在这样的条件下劳动的结果表示不满，那是十分合理和自然的。
    在我的发言的一部分里，我也想批判地回顾一下我们所走过的发展道路。但是个别的文学家想把最近几年苏联文学的发展看成几乎是完全“落后”的，对于这些意见我还是有权利表示不同意。
    我在苏联文学界工作了三十多年，跟我的许多同辈作家一样，我听到这类牢骚已经不止一次了。当国家过渡到新的更高级的发展阶段，我们生活的急速发展特别显著地表明，人民的伟大生活在文学作品里反映得不够广泛和充分，——逢到这样的时候，总要听到个别的人嚷叫文学好像是“没落”了。实际上文学正在发展，壮大，正在包罗一切新的生活领域，而且有能力解决复杂的艺术任务的文学家的数量正在不断的增加。
    我们可以回忆一下第一个五年计划时代。如果从当时的某些杂志论文看来，简直可以认为文学的发展是停顿了。但是就在这第一个五年计划时代，我们有了这样一些作品：萧洛霍夫的“被开垦的处女地”，托尔斯泰的“彼得一世”，列昂诺夫的“索溪”，卡达耶夫的“时间呀，前进！”潘菲洛夫的“布罗斯基”，伊林的“伟大计划的故事”，夏金娘的“中央发电站”，爱伦堡的“第二天”。
    只要想一想，只在最近一年半中间就出版了：列昂诺夫的“俄罗斯森林”，革拉特珂夫的“艰苦的年头”，格罗斯曼的“为正义事业斗争”，一些可以算作俄罗斯散文的杰出现象的作品。还出版了这样一些好书：朱科夫斯基的“波罗的海天空”，格拉宁的“追求者”，卡札凯维奇的“朋友的心”，尼古拉耶娃的“拖拉机站站长和总农艺师的故事”和奥维奇金的“特写集”。（鼓掌）
    这些作品大多是新的，长篇小说“为正义事业斗争”和中篇小说“朋友的心”都是受了批评之后经过作者改写过的。现在这些书都有权在过去一年的优秀作品中占据一席地位了。（鼓掌）
    我只提出了最近时期的八部作品，任何一个有着艺术家的同情心和对文学抱着崇高态度的文学家，都不能否认，我提出的那些作品——虽然它们也有着个别的缺点——开辟了生活和人们关系的新领域，是真正有意义的文学作品。我们必须看到文学发展的活的过程，而不要拿一般的公式来硬套。
    文学落后于生活。是的，如果拿人民功业的全部规模去和我们所创造的一切相比，那末这是对的。但是苏联文学之所以强大，也就是因为无论在过去，现在和将来，它总是有着许多对新鲜事物感觉灵敏的老作家和青年作家，——而且他们的数量正在不断增加——他们在我们面前开辟一切新的生活面，他们有能力解决巨大的艺术任务。
    作家对于生活还是研究得不够。是的，这对于我们中间许多人说来是对的。但是如果说许多作家都不熟悉生活，都不研究生活，那么怎么能创造出数十部优秀作品，而且其中有许多成了苏联文学的光荣和骄傲呢？
    作家没有充分掌握艺术技巧。这对于我们中间许许多多人是多么对啊！但是永远不能忘记，苏联文学提供了一大批散文、诗歌、戏剧的杰出大师，而且他们不但用俄文写，也用我们各民族的文字写。
    可以提出很多青年作家的名字，他们对于美好事物有着灵敏的感觉，对待自己的文学工作的态度很严肃。
    我们有许多文学家企图用“无冲突论”来解释和辩护自己的弱点，那是太天真了。有些作家懒于深入苏联人的生活，而生活各方面正蓬勃地进行着新旧斗争。在许多场合，作家也作了这样的努力，但是因为对于帮助观察真正生活真理的世界观还掌握得不够，他们辨别不清事件，辨别不清人们的关系，对生活中新的和先进的事物的发展道路看得不够清楚，因此不敢打击人们意识里旧的私有世界的残余，或者更多的是，他们看到了这些，但是完全没有掌握好表现生活冲突的形式。于是他走上讲坛说：“声名狼籍的‘无冲突论’妨碍了我写作。”
  （鼓掌）唉，得了吧，这种“理论”是否存在呢？
    也有些作家和批评家，他们企图拿“应该这样写”的公式来断定我们许多作家的这些弱点，但这还不是“理论”，要达到理论的水平，也还需要提高呢。
    如果说这种“理论”是存在的，那末它也早在三年前就已经被揭发了。但是为什么在我们戏剧创作方面的进步还是这样微小呢？不，显然问题不在于“理论”。你能想像，列昂诺夫会写出没有冲突的小说和剧本来吗？如果我们优秀的作家、诗人、剧作家不了解，各种文学体裁的作品大多数是以冲突为基础的，怎么还会创造出苏联散文、诗歌、戏剧的优秀作品呢？
    不，同志们，我们不要用任何一种书本上的
  “理论”来为自己的弱点辩护吧。
    如果在我们的出版社和管理艺术和文学的领导机关里，也包括作家协会在内，有人——这样的人大概还是有的——由于落后和保守而促进过而且还在促进粉饰现实、不谈矛盾和成长的困难的这种倾向，——这像生活各方面一样，也是文学里的新旧斗争的表现。不善于用自己的笔跟生活里的旧事物斗争并且肯定和发扬新事物的作家，就是对文学和艺术里的这些现象屈服 。成为文学的花朵和力量的人，他们之所以卓越，也就是因为凡是有新旧斗争的地方，他们都能以战士的姿态深入生活。人民喜爱的作品就是属于这样的作家的。
    同志们！我们了解自由文学的主要一面就是，我们的作家，无论是党员作家还是非党员作家，都公开承认共产党在生活的一切方面和文学事业中的领导作用。
    资产阶级作家是从属于以金融工业头子为主子的资产阶级政党的，从属于他们的出版社，他们的报刊。资产阶级的无党派性是虚伪的。
    我们的共产党是我们人民的产物，是我们人民最优秀、最先进、最觉悟、最有组织的部分。苏联文学是受到党的伟大思想的鼓舞的。
    苏联文学的党性并不是仅仅少数党员作家所有的特殊现象。这是我们苏联文学的历史性的本质。我们当然有敌人，有思想上的异己分子。也有些优秀的作家在创作上犯了错误，脱离了党性。但是我们说到苏联文学的党性，我们指的是这样的一个历史事实，就是苏联作家，无论是党员作家或非党员作家，都承认共产党的思想是正确的，而且他们在创作上捍卫这种思想，所以很自然的他们也承认党在文学事业里的领导作用。
    我们这里已经形成了，而且还在不断形成从历史意义上说来是新型的作家——为共产主义斗争的自觉的战士。
    我所以说“不断形成”，是因为生活在不断前进，它不断要求苏联作家越来越新的品质。
    中央委员会的祝词里说到我们需要哪一种类型的作家：“苏联人民希望看到他们的作家是积极深入生活和帮助人民建设新社会的热情的战士，在这个新社会里，一切社会财富的泉源将像洪流似的丰富，在这个新社会里，将不断产生那在心理上摆脱了资本主义残余的新人。”
    祝词里以强大的真理的力量说到在越来越广大的国际舞台上进行的社会主义和资本主义之间的竞赛，说到侵略的和反动的阶层企图用暴力阻止社会主义力量的生长。
    在我们苏维埃作家身上，党看见的是保卫伟大的人道主义思想和反对帝国主义思想的战士，是保卫各族人民的和平友好的战士。党对我们说，我们的文学在跟人们意识里的资本主义残余斗争时会成为怎样的精神力量，党提醒我们，苏联文学的社会改造和教育的作用是无比地提高了，党提醒我们：
  “我们的文学的使命不仅是反映新事物，而且是尽力帮助新事物取得胜利。”
    我们的文学之所以产生许多缺点，的的确确是由于不少作家不熟悉生活、脱离生活或者懒于研究生活，可是我们应该用为共产主义斗争的热情战士的眼睛来观察生活。
    对于大会前展开的关于抒情诗的讨论，我个人比较倾向于支持奥尔迦·别尔高尔茨，（鼓掌）出发点就是我刚才所说的。不但在抒情诗的领域里，而且在艺术创作的一切领域里，作家应该把自己、把自己的思想感情、把自己的爱我们苏联人和恨我们敌人、恨妨碍我们前进的一切保守和落后的东西的热情，完完全全放到认识和反映生活的事业里去。无论作家说什么，无论他反映哪一方面的生活，他应该把自己的经历放到这一切中去。（鼓掌）
    这样的文学观，不但不抵触马克思列宁主义的反映客观现实的文学观，相反地只有从这样的立场出发，才可以正确了解生活和在人的心里唤起真正的感情。（鼓掌）
    我拥护作家奥维奇金在大会讲坛上发出的号召：“接近生活！”我甚至也同意他这样的意见：我们的辽阔无边的国家的各个地区里都是这样的期待着作家，这样的热爱着作家，所以到各地去生活生活和工作工作，对于许多作家是有益的。不过问题究竟不在于什么人在什么地方生活。热爱生活和有着战士热忱的作家，在他们的心灵督促之下，随时随地都可以找到生活中的新鲜事物的。（鼓掌）
      关于这方面，我很想友好地对华伦丁·奥维奇金说几句话，希望他不要向他的其他的同业炫耀他的生活知识。（鼓掌）
    我们知道，奥维奇金和集体农庄生活有着密切的联系，所以我们很尊敬他。目前他在我们中间还是以文学中的正面人物的姿态出现。但是如果他开始把自己的形象“活跃”得倒过头来，那就要把自己搞坏了。
    现在再谈谈关于抒情诗的论争，我劝奥尔迦·别尔高尔茨还是放弃“自我表现”那个用语；用俄文说起来这个字没有意思，大概正因为如此，所以当年它曾被各式各样的颓废派利用过。
    据说，奥尔迦·别尔高尔茨在论争中引用别林斯基的话引得不对。哦，那没关系！让有学问的人去选择更适当的引语来表达别尔高尔茨的正确思想吧。难道问题在引证吗？（鼓掌）
      不能毫无个性地描写我们出色的苏联人，谈论我们的社会主义生活，谈论妨碍它前进的东西。苏联作家是对我们的人民、对我们的全部生活充满着热烈的爱的人。在有一次会议上，作家卡达耶夫说得很对，我们的文学不能分成“集体农庄”文学、
  “生产”文学或者描写知识分子的文学。那时候卡达耶夫说，古典文学之所以出色，是因为它描写了当时的社会。我们的文学也应该是描写苏维埃社会的文学。
      这并不是说，作家不能反映他所比较熟悉的生活面，表现他所比较熟悉的社会阶层和他所比较喜爱的职业的人。但是真正的才能和真正的艺术技巧首先在于善于爱一切，爱一切新事物——我们生活各方面的新事物，——并且善于反映作家在生活中碰到的一切。
    这种爱会给作家打开所有的大门，会在他面前展示一切生活冲突。这样一来，用什么秤来衡量作品的正面人物和反面人物，——这种烦琐的论争也就永远不会再发生了。
    我们不能不谈谈文学中的正面形象和反面形象，因为在生活中新世界和旧世界的力量并不是没有个性的，它们是体现在活人身上的，我们作家不单单描写人，而且还要给他们作道德上的判决。
    爱伦堡有一点说得很对：“英雄主义、创造激情、爱人民和反对自私自利、漠不关心和保守倾向的斗争，现在正在许多人的意识里、心里进行，这里进行的就是新事物向过去的阴影战斗，善向恶战斗。”
    我们应该了解，人们不是站在原处不动的。他们在不断地成长，不断地被我们的社会所教育和改造。
    从一个作家、一个觉悟的共产主义战士的立场出发的人生观，以生活本身的材料告诉作家，新旧事物是怎样和以什么形式表现在人们身上的。
    从战士作家的立场来看，论争苏联讽刺文学里应该有多少正面人物，可以不可以写只有反面人物的讽刺作品，这样的论争也是烦琐的。
    在讽刺体裁里，正像在别的一切里一样，还有一个人物，——也许这是最主要的，那就是作者自己。我们的讽刺文学，正如我们伟大的先辈的讽刺文学一样，首先是人道主义的。一个作家，如果他热爱我们的新生活、而且为了肯定和发展它而暴露一切反抗它的敌对的和保守的事物，他总能找到形式来表达他的爱和恨，不能忘记，在各种体裁的讽刺文学里，这方面的问题是可以用不同的方式来解决的。
    党中央委员会的祝词提醒我们，苏联文学和苏联作家，是在跟异己的影响、跟资产阶级思想和资本主义残余的表现进行斗争之中成长和锻炼起来的。是的，我们是在斗争的条件中成长和培养起来的，如果不看到，斗争的形式虽然在变化，斗争还在继续进行，那是不正确的。
    当然，在我们的文学里，资产阶级的民族主义者、世界主义者，“为艺术而艺术”的拥护者，已经不是那么有力量，但是他们的思想还反映着和我们敌对的帝国主义思想。侵略的和反动的阶层想用暴力的方式来阻止社会主义的生长和压制各族人民解除资本剥削和殖民地压迫的愿望，他们企图培植和极力支持资产阶级思想在我国的各种表现。我们大家都必须记住，许多年来我们跟民族主义与世界主义的表现、跟庸俗化、缺乏思想性、颓废倾向进行的斗争是正义的斗争，如果我们不把这种斗争坚决进行下去，我们的思想上的敌人就要给苏联文学的发展以巨大的损害。
    这些跟我们敌对的思想的代表曾经造成了很大的灾害，但如果以为这些思想已经不存在，那是太天真了。不，我们现在而且将来还要跟这些异己思想的重现发生冲突。
    在我们大会前几个月中间成为讨论对象和受到苏联文学界谴责的“新世界”杂志编辑部所犯的错误，可算是这种思想表现的最典型的例子。
    我想再回过来谈谈“新世界”杂志上宣布的所谓“文学中的真诚性”的问题。
    真正的文学不会不是真诚的和正直的，这甚至在学生的课业里也不必提的，正如不必证明，水是湿的。
    不过在我们俄罗斯社会生活的发展里有过一些时期，文学曾经面临过这个问题。大家知道，车尔尼雪夫斯基有一篇卓越的论文“论批评中的真诚性”。凡是仔细读过这篇论文的人，都立刻会看出，它虽然全面地接触到艺术性的问题，但是带着政治的性质的。
    在这篇论文里，革命民主主义者车尔尼雪夫斯基，以在沙皇制度条件下被压迫人民的代表的资格，来暴露那些反映在有时候甚至很著名的作家的作品里的错误的反人民思想，而且驳斥资产阶级地主的自由主义批评家，因为这些批评家正在鼓励、支持和渲染这些错误的反人民思想，他们欺骗人民和适应沙皇制度。
    由此可见，对似乎大家都清楚的问题发表意见的这种要求，在车尔尼雪夫斯基是带着政治性的。
    我们文学里有时候还可以遇到粗制滥造者和随波逐流者，——这是我们社会的霉霉。但是我们文学中更多的是在艺术方面没有经验的人。他们常常找不到方法来表达他们不但是真诚的而且是他们整个生命所产生和充满着爱人民的热情的思想和感情。苏联作家和全体人民一起为了社会主义制度在我国取得胜利而斗争，他们和党及人民一起通过了建设新的公平合理的社会的最艰苦阶段，他们在战场上流血，保卫社会主义祖国和打击敌人，在他们看来，在我国所创造的一切事物上都印着他们父母兄弟姐妹甚至子女的劳动的痕迹，——只有发疯的庸人才会说这些苏联作家不真诚，才会说你我这些把一生都献给了为共产主义斗争的事业的人不真诚。（鼓掌）
    像大家所看到，这篇论文作者要求发表这方面的意见，也是带着政治性的：希望伟大的苏联文学放弃鼓舞着它的那些共产主义思想，而成为异己思想的传导者。
    在大会上可以听到对作家协会领导上提出的各种不同的批评意见。这些批评意见大多是正确的。不过我要非常坚决地说，作家协会领导上对苏联文学做了一件大事，它向文学界揭发和说明了“新世界”杂志编辑部的思想错误。
    有些同志——数目并不多——忘记了，文学里的思想斗争还在继续进行，还有些势力正在反对我们。在检查妨碍我们文学更迅速和充分地发展的原因的时候，这个问题是不能不谈的，那就是我们的人道主义思想跟仇视人类的帝国主义思想进行斗争的问题，因为在我们整个行星上，在一切国家和大陆的内部都在进行这个斗争，至于在我国内部来反对我们，那不过是这个有全世界历史意义的斗争的反应而已。
    每一个忠于苏维埃制度的正直的苏联作家，在批评我们自己的缺点和毛病的时候，在我看来，不但应该从热爱我们的共同事业出发，而且应该从尊重自己出发，在作家面前和在人民面前确定他对苏联文学的思想敌人、对反对苏联文学的敌对势力所抱的态度，——尤其在这样的时候，当他作为一个苏联作家站在苏联作家代表大会讲坛这样崇高的讲坛上说话的时候。
    每一个苏联作家都是珍惜苏联的兄长地位和荣誉的，当他不谈苏联文学的思想敌人的问题，而把批评的火力完全集中在可以由我们自己决定的那些方面的生活，而且作这种批评的时候极尽鞭挞的能事，——他自己没有发觉到，他给敌人留下了混到他那里去的空子。
    我仔细听了奥维奇金、阿里格尔、别尔高尔茨、卡维林的批评意见，发现他们的批评里有着不少正确的地方，这我下面还要谈到。但是我觉得，这些作家如果同时想到我刚才所说的话，他们的发言的收获一定还要大。
    我仔细读了米哈依尔·萧洛霍夫发言的速记记录，我也可以拿这些话来对他说。
    一个作家，一个为共产主义斗争的觉悟的热情的战士，他总应该首先看到他的主要的思想敌人；他应该首先向他算账，这样只会使他在批评那些可以由我们自己决定和可以由我们来纠正的问题的时候更有力量。（鼓掌）这应用到米哈依尔·萧洛霍夫身上更公平，因为他是我国的大作家，人民对他的爱是无限的，他的威望很高，他自己可以在纠正我们全部文学事业发展中的缺点方面做很多事情。
  （鼓掌）可惜他却用他的发言来作人身攻击——，这是不严肃的。
    上面提到的那些同志都是苏联的好作家，我要忠告他们：“感谢你们的批评，不过还是请你们对自己在大会上的发言稍微考虑一下，也许你们最后会同意我的意见，这些发言里有着很大的毛病。”
    党中央委员会的祝词里曾就苏联文学的使命说过些崇高的话：“苏联文学，作为世界上最先进的文学，它的使命是为劳动者的事业服务，而且要达到世界艺术创作的最高峰。”为了走上世界艺术创作的最高峰，应该学习，多多学习，全面地学习。我还要一再说，我们的古典遗产——俄罗斯的，我们各兄弟民族的、全世界的文学——是苏联作家最好的艺术学校。
    伟大的列宁说过，我们应该批判地接受和整理人类在它全部发展过程中创造的一切精华。
    我要提出警告，在接受旧的古典遗产方面必须防止一度流行过的庸俗化观点。我们常常碰到这样一种论调，仿佛苏联文学只是继承过去的现实主义艺术的。
    有些文学家就认为，过去有过我们现在所继承的现实主义的人民的艺术，也有过只属于所谓资产阶级所有的反现实主义的反人民的艺术。例如在今年九月十六日“真理报”发表的“美学问题和苏联文学”一文里，阿·索波列夫就发表了这样的观点。他写道：“反动阶级以前支持过、现在还在支持反现实主义的反人民的艺术。工人阶级走上了历史斗争的舞台，……就以保卫真正现实主义艺术的积极战士的姿态出现了。”
    我年轻的时候，也拥护过这样的观点，当时甚至还写过“打倒席勒！”的论文。（笑声）过了一些时候，我才了解，苏联文学是要把人类在它过去发展中所创造的一切先进的和进步的东西完全继承下来的。当然，这种先进的和进步的东西的确常常正就是表现在现实主义的艺术当中，但是从我们的古典遗产中抛弃掉席勒，那是愚蠢的。这样对待维克多·雨果那样的浪漫主义作家尤为正确。在中央图书发行局里我和费定看到一些材料，雨果的作品在我国出版的印数总额是八百五十万册，超过了巴尔札克作品的二百五十万册的印数，莫泊桑作品的印数是三百万册，超过了左拉作品的印数一倍以上。
    为什么现在谈谈这一点很重要呢？因为批判地接受古典文学形式的财富能促进社会主义现实主义形式的丰富和多样化。（鼓掌）
    萨美德·武尔贡有一点说得很对：社会主义现实主义的使命不是使世界文学的形式贫乏而是使它丰富。
    提出了文学的党性原则的伟大的列宁指示道：
  “不必争论，在这个事业上绝对必须保证个人创造性、个人爱好的广大天地，必须保证思想和幻想、形式和内容的广大天地。”
    中央委员会给大会的祝词也说：“社会主义现实主义使得有可能发挥广泛的创造性主动精神、有可能按照作家自己的爱好和志趣来选择各种各样的创作形式和风格。”
    从这个观点看来，我要支持苏尔科夫和西蒙诺夫在报告里所表示的那个意见，就是在我们社会主义现实主义内部，事实上存在着形式和风格方面的各种不同的创作流派，而且将来这些流派还要发展和进行竞赛。属于不同流派的作家，他们的创作是在总的社会主义现实主义原则上发展起来的，如果他们得出结论，他们必须有组织地形成起来，那是很有害的。这所以有害，是因为在这些流派之间不能划分严格的界限，想划分这种界限的任何企图都只会造成狭隘的宗派主义作风。
    必须记住，在形式和风格方面是常常从一种形式和风格转变成另一种形式和风格的。有些诗人在自己的创作里利用他们所能利用的形式的全部财富。只要不是模仿，这就是诗人的艺术技巧的表现。过去在我们的诗歌里，伟大的普希金就是提供了一个伟大的范例。我们大家也都熟悉，弗拉基米尔·马雅可夫斯基拥有着多么丰富的诗歌表现形式。
    我觉得，苏尔科夫报告的优点是他对于社会主义现实主义内部苏联文学的形式和风格的多样化的了解。从这个意义来说，苏尔科夫举出这么多不同的名字，甚至是有益处的。应该想到，我们常常忘记问题的这一面。这个报告是客观的，这样的报告是我们苏联文学现在所最需要的。
    从作家协会和它的选举出来的机关所受到的批评，可以完全清楚地看出，作家对他们的协会和大会后的领导机关期望多么高。
    中央委员会在它的祝词里对于作家协会在解决苏联文学面临的任务方面所应起的作用作了很高的估价。二十年来的作家协会，祝词中说，“成长为一个建立在集体领导原则基础上的、团结了党员和非党员作家的一切创作力量的强大群众团体。”
    作家协会理事会总结了二十年的工作。在这个期间，直接参加理事会主席团和理事会书记处工作的人变换了好多次，在这二十年中理事会里用推选的方式补充了许多新的作家力量。
    作家希望作家协会以后不要破坏苏维埃民主的原则，希望作家代表大会在会章规定的时期内如期召开，希望作家协会的理事会、主席团和书记处也都正规地进行工作，希望不要再用推选的方法，而保证作家协会一切机关从上到下都维持选举的制度。（鼓掌）
    作家协会工作中的许多缺点和错误的原因是在于过去二十年间作家协会的集体领导原则没有始终被遵守。有些时候，作家协会个别领导者手里集中权力太多。作家希望协会里保证真正的集体领导，希望有一个比较广泛的主席团行使充分的权力来解决理事会全体会议休会期间作家协会工作中的问题，希望作家协会书记处也成为向理事会和主席团负责的机关。
    但是，谢妙·基尔萨诺夫在发言里影影绰绰地表示了一种意见，他认为书记处的机能几乎是技术性的机能，对书记处这样了解，是应当反对的。
    还有人认为可以设立一个使世界上一切人都满意的主席团和书记处，这也是不正确的。必须争取到使主席团和书记处真正履行它们对作家所负的责任，同时并且行使它们选举出来的机关的权力，指导作家协会在反对异己思想和保卫苏联作家崇高道德品质的斗争中的全部思想艺术工作。
    作家希望在他们的社会创作团体里尊重由下而上的批评和自我批评。作家希望自由创作讨论的形式成为澄清思想创作问题的基本形式。但是玛格丽塔·阿里格尔在大会上表示的对于广泛的创作讨论的了解，是不能同意的。她说，讨论，“如果相信俄语详解辞典，那意思就是目的在于澄清各种不同观点的某一争执问题的讨论，而不必由愿意决定这些不同观点是错误的机关来作总结。”这一点是不能同意的，因为在讨论中只澄清各种不同的观点，是没有意思的。各种不同的观点不会是都正确的。古时候有句笑话：“要是从两恶中选择，那甚至一个不正确的观点也要比两个正确的观点强。”
    我们是依靠马克思列宁主义的社会科学的。依照这种科学，客观真理是存在的，而且是可以认识清楚的。广泛的自由的创作讨论之所以需要，就是为了比较各种不同的观点，然后从中找出客观真理，尽可能使它成为全体作家的财富，并且依靠用这种方法发现的真理来向前推进，取得新的成就。
    不过有一种意见是对的，就是认为在自由而广泛的创作讨论中，如果——无论哪一方面——把自己的观点看作是一种定论，必须大家同意，强迫别人接受自己的观点，而忽视集体的意见，这是不正确的。我们的作家协会的主要机能是思想艺术教育的机能。所以我们关心的是在集体的讨论中使真理彻底澄清，并且为大家所了解。所以从这个观点出发，创作讨论是应该集体地准备和集体地进行的。
    因此我想说几句话，谈谈我们的意义重大的苏联出版在评价文学现象方面的作用和地位。
    还用说吗，我们的出版物对苏联文学的发展曾经起过、现在还起着多么大的助力，它真实地估计苏联文学的现象，帮助作家辨别自己的错误，指出文学发展的道路。对文学现象作了判断和判决，而不容人家分辩，那是不能容许的，但是我们的出版物上有时候还发生这种情形。（鼓掌）
    当然，如果出版物不帮助苏联作家和整个苏联社会及时揭发异己的和敌对的东西和纠正这些或那些严重的错误，那它就没有完成它的任务。但是在绝大多数场合，苏联出版物接触到的苏联文学现象，都是个人创作面貌不同和各有各的特点的正直的苏联作家所创造的。在大多数场合，出版物事先了解一下社会舆论、作家和读者对于作品的意见，还是比较有好处的。编辑部无论怎么好，也不应当把决定作品命运的权力掌握在自己手里。
    应该估计到，群众、苏联社会舆论对我们的出版物是非常信任的。
    例如，大家知道，作家格罗斯曼在他的长篇小说“为正义事业斗争”里犯过真正严重的错误，在批评这些错误时犯了偏差的首先是我们的出版物。因此给一部分苏联社会舆论界和作家协会内部在这部小说周围造成了这样一种的空气，以至于使我们这些没有看出格罗斯曼的错误的人，不得不承担下了实际上比作者所犯的错误和我们所犯的错误更大的罪过。当然，无论如何这不能替我们辩护，我至今还感到很遗憾，当我对小说发表意见时显得很懦弱，我支持了对这部小说的公正的批评，但是没有反对批评中的偏差，我把这部小说称为在思想上有害的作品。（鼓掌）
    在某种程度上我纠正了我的这个错误，我同军事出版社一同帮助格罗斯曼修改这部小说，直到这部小说基本上纠正了主要错误而出版为止。（鼓掌）
    作家希望作家协会和它的新的领导治愈我们有些同业的“幼稚病”——宗派主义。宗派主义这种
  “幼稚病”近年来没有受到应有的打击，我们这些长久处在作家协会领导地位的人在某种程度上自己是要负责的。
    作家思想艺术教育方面的工作做得很差，作家协会里缺乏广泛的创作生活，因此促成了这种无原则的宗派主义的发展。不过应该说，作家协会的大多数会员，首先是我们文学界的主导干部，特别是老作家和我们最年青的作家层，却没有犯这种毛病。
    宗派主义的害处是在于它把个人的和宗派的因素放到估计文学现象的事情上去，妨碍了对这些现象作客观的批评，破坏了作家之间的自然的同志关系。作家的创作风格虽然各不相同，但是他们都是站在共同的思想立场上的。这种害处主要是在于使纠缠在宗派主义里的作家常常给他们的所谓“敌人”扣上政治的帽子。（鼓掌）
    在这次大会上对作家协会的工作做了不少、而且常常是正确的批评。但是作家应该知道，在批评作家的思想立场和批评作品的时候有着许多错误和歪曲，而宗派主义在这一方面起了很坏的作用。
    我们报刊编辑部的工作人员必须了解，我们文学界有些作家还犯着这种宗派主义的“幼稚病”，他们必须估计到，这些数目并不很多的苏联文学代表在报刊上发表批评论文可能会不客观，必须加以仔细审查。
    另一方面，我们很清楚，犯这种毛病的人，实际上大多数是正直的苏联作家，而且常常是很不错的，甚至很好的。我们应当很直率地告诉他们，他们应当快些摆脱他们的“幼稚病”，因为这种毛病只有利于苏联文学的敌人。他们的责任，苏联作家、为共产主义事业斗争的觉悟的战士的责任，是把这一点好好儿想一想，并且从里面作出真诚的原则性的结论。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们！我们有幸在社会压迫和民族压迫一去不返的国家里从事创造工作；我们正在建设一个人们关系很合理的新世界。我们被伟大的苏联人民的爱所包围着。为了全人类的幸福而把全部精力献给改造和装饰祖国的事业的人，成了我们作品的英雄人物。我们的高尔基的话从来没有这样强有力地响过：人这个字听起来多么高傲。
    我们从过去几代人的手里接下了人道主义的接力赛棒，历史责成我们负起神圣的责任来把它送到光明的共产主义的未来。时间在我们面前提出了人们共产主义教育和改造的全世界历史性的任务。还有什么能比这个责任更光荣呢？
    我们现在不是孤单地行动了。我们有着许多同业的盟友。有的是保卫和平、和平共居的共同思想把我们和他们团结起来的。有的是维护民主自由和民族独立的要求把我们和他们团结起来的。有的是由于发展道路相同而和我们接近的。
    我们可以有充分的权利说，所有一切正直的和活的东西，——这是每一个不论大小的民族的文学里都有的，而且也不会没有的，——这一切现在都以本民族进步力量的精神表现的形式出现了。现在我们可以说，世界进步文学是强大的。我们正在和它并肩前进。
    愿第二次全苏作家代表大会留在我们的意识里成为我们发展道路上的巨大的历史指标。我们将用一切的力量来保卫人道主义、各族人民之间和平友好的思想。但是如果侵略的和反动的势力胆敢侵略我们的制度——全世界劳动者和被压迫者的希望，我们苏联作家一定要彻底完成我们对我们的人民和全体进步人类所负的责任。（鼓掌）
    我们意识到了我们面临的全世界历史性的任务，依靠着我们亲爱的共产党和它的中央委员会的帮助和领导，我们将创造出无愧于我们伟大的人民和我们所生活的英雄时代的文学。（继续不断鼓掌）
