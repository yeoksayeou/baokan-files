Today, as we commemorate the 37th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai of our country sent a telegram to Chairman Voroshilov, Chairman Bulganin, and Deputy Chairman and Foreign Minister Molotov of the Soviet Union, on behalf of the government and people of the People's Republic of China, extending warm congratulations and heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet government, the great Soviet people, and their army. They also dispatched a delegation headed by Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai to the Lushunkou area to express condolences to the Soviet troops stationed there, to express the deep respect of our government and people for them, and to extend warm congratulations to the heroic Soviet Army on behalf of our government and people.

The Soviet Army is composed of the outstanding sons and daughters of the working people of the Soviet socialist state, armed with the thought of Marxism-Leninism, and is a great patriotic and internationalist army. It is the strong defender of the Soviet communist construction and also the strong defender of the world's peace, democracy, and socialist cause. In its early days, it defeated the invasion of the Soviet state by fourteen imperialist countries with unparalleled bravery and wisdom, and crushed countless domestic counter-revolutionary riots supported by imperialist countries, forcing imperialism to recognize the great existence of the Soviet state. In the Second World War, the Soviet Army thoroughly crushed the fanatical German fascist army that attempted to dominate the world, not only defending its own Soviet state, but also liberating many European countries. In August 1945, this army, with the force of a landslide, crushed the most elite Kwantung Army of Japanese imperialism in a very short period of time, liberating Northeast China and northern Korea. But the Soviet Army never infringed upon the sovereignty and territorial integrity of any country. It unconditionally returned the vast amount of land in other countries that it had liberated in the process of pursuing and annihilating the invaders to the people of those countries for their own control and management. The people of the liberated countries and the peace-loving people all over the world regard the Soviet Army as their closest friends and a strong defender of world peace. The Chinese people are particularly clear about how closely the Soviet state and its army are related to the security and construction of our own motherland, and how closely they are related to the peace of the Far East and the world!

History has proven, and will continue to prove, the great significance and role of this relationship. As Chairman Mao Zedong, Chairman Liu Shaoqi, and Premier Zhou Enlai said in their telegram congratulating the Soviet Army on its 37th anniversary: "At a time when the imperialist war group is stepping up the creation of international tension, preparing for atomic war, carrying out war provocations, and seriously threatening world peace, the powerful and long-tested Soviet Army is an invincible force for defending world peace."

The Soviet troops stationed at the Lushunkou Naval Base have been working closely with the Chinese People's Liberation Army since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance and the Agreement on the Chinese Changchun Railway, Lushunkou, and Dalian in February 1950, jointly striving to "prevent the resurgence of Japanese imperialism and the re-aggression by Japan or other countries colluding with Japan in aggressive actions in any form." In September 1951, the United States openly signed a one-sided peace treaty with Japan that excluded China and the Soviet Union, and signed the so-called US-Japan Security Treaty and the US-Japan Administrative Agreement with Japan, placing Japan under long-term US military occupation, attempting to make Japan a tool for US aggression in Asia. At that time, the United States was expanding its war of aggression against Korea, the US Air Force was constantly harassing the Northeast region of our country, conducting inhumane bacteriological warfare against the people of China and Korea, and was directing the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to attempt to harass the mainland of our country; these were seriously threatening the security of our country and seriously threatening the peace of the Far East and the world. Based on this situation, in September 1952, when the Soviet troops were supposed to withdraw from the Lushunkou Naval Base in accordance with the agreement, at the suggestion of our government and with the consent of the Soviet government, China and the Soviet Union decided to extend the term of joint use of the Lushunkou Naval Base. Later, thanks to the efforts of China, the Soviet Union, and other peace-loving countries, the wars in Korea and Indochina ceased one after another, the achievements of the Geneva Conference eased international tensions to some extent, and the Japanese people's struggle for independence, democracy, and peace was rising. At the same time, with the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, our country rapidly strengthened its national defense capabilities. Therefore, the Chinese and Soviet governments issued a joint declaration on relations with Japan in October 1954, expressing their willingness to take steps to normalize Sino-Japanese and Soviet-Japanese relations, and to support Japan's efforts in this regard. China and the Soviet Union agreed to withdraw the Soviet troops from the Lushunkou Naval Base before May 31, 1955. This series of measures are fully in line with the vital interests of our people, in line with the needs of peace in the Far East and the world, and have been supported and praised by our people and the peace-loving people of other countries.

However, our agreement to the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the Lushunkou Naval Base, and to our People's Liberation Army taking on the full responsibility of defending the sea, does not mean that our sea defense is completely without problems, or that we have relaxed our vigilance against the adventurous plans and actions of the imperialist aggressive bloc. Not at all! We are always vigilant against the US aggressive bloc's conspiracies to create new wars, and we must always be prepared to give a resolute blow to the arrogant actions of the new war instigators.

At present, the US aggressive bloc continues to intensify the rearmament of West Germany, attempting to revive Japanese militarism, and intends to put together aggressive armies in the West through the Paris Agreement and in the East through the Manila Treaty. It also wantonly interferes in the internal affairs of many countries and occupies the territories of many countries as US military bases to threaten and surround our country, the Soviet Union, and the people's democratic countries. The US aggressive bloc is not only trying to create international tensions, but is also increasingly frantically engaging in atomic war clamor and intimidation. On the Taiwan issue, the United States completely disregards historical facts and international agreements, and unreasonably interferes in our people's struggle to liberate their territory of Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. US Secretary of State Dulles, in his speech on US foreign policy at the Foreign Policy Association on the 16th of this month, openly demanded the further establishment of a "Great Arc," stretching from the Aleutian Islands to the South Pacific, to encircle our country and invade Asia. He arrogantly claimed that our territory of Taiwan and Penghu should be turned into "an important part" of the US "Western Pacific defense system," claiming that the United States would use its armed forces to "protect" Taiwan, Penghu, and "related positions and territories." However, madmen like Dulles will be taught an even more severe lesson. Justice belongs to us, with the powerful strength of 800 million people in China and the Soviet Union, and with the support of the socialist camp countries and the peace-loving people of the world, our just cause will surely triumph. We are determined to defend peace and oppose war, and if the imperialist aggressive bloc insists on imposing war on us, we are not afraid of resisting the war of aggression.

Chairman Mao Zedong said on the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance:
		"We can all see that with the great cooperation between our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, all imperialist plans of aggression cannot but be shattered. They must be completely shattered. As long as imperialism launches a war of aggression, we and the people of the world must wipe them off the face of the earth!" This is our unshakable belief and determination!

Our national defense capabilities, with the help of the Soviet Union, are becoming increasingly stronger in all aspects. The five years of joint use of the Lushunkou Naval Base by China and the Soviet Union have also proved this fact. Our sea defense forces have greatly improved in learning and mastering advanced military science, and in equipment, technology, organization, training, and command. Our sea defense strength has been greatly enhanced. The Soviet troops stationed in Lushunkou have made great efforts and worked hard to help our country strengthen its sea defense capabilities and help our sea defense forces master modern science, technology, and equipment. The Chinese people and army will never forget this selfless, brotherly help and guidance from the Soviet troops.

The Soviet troops not only helped the growth and expansion of our sea defense forces, but also provided many possible assistance to local peaceful construction. They were also concerned about and cared for the local people, just like their own compatriots, and helped many people overcome various difficulties. For the first time in history, the Chinese people saw a foreign army that treated them with a completely equal and friendly attitude. For the local people who had been oppressed and ravaged by the Japanese army, the US army, and the domestic reactionary army for many years and had nowhere to reason, this was an extremely profound practical internationalist education. The local people, with deep friendship and love for the Soviet troops, also treated the Soviet troops like their own sons and soldiers, and often gave the Soviet troops all possible help and support, enabling them to smoothly overcome various difficulties and complete their glorious tasks. This noble internationalist military-civilian relationship embodies and deepens the great Sino-Soviet friendship, and it will further solidify into a powerful force sufficient to overcome everything.

Now, as we warmly celebrate the anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army, and as the Soviet troops in the Lushunkou area are about to leave our country and return to the Soviet Union one after another, we must continue to intensify the consolidation and enhancement of our sea defense forces, and we must work harder to learn advanced Soviet military science and technology, and constantly improve ourselves in equipment, training, and command, and build our People's Liberation Army into a completely modernized army like the Soviet Army. We must not only have a fully modernized and powerful army, but also a fully modernized and powerful navy and air force. Our army must more universally and deeply learn from our closest brotherly armed forces - the Soviet Army, and most rapidly and effectively strengthen our national defense capabilities, and continue to strengthen the friendship of the Chinese and Soviet armies fighting for peace. Let the brotherly armed forces of our two countries cooperate more closely in the struggle to defend peace! Let us hail the Soviet Army - our brotherly armed forces! Long live!

    加强中苏军队为保卫和平而斗争的友谊
    今天，当苏联建军三十七周年纪念日到来的时候，我国毛泽东主席、刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理致电苏联伏罗希洛夫主席、布尔加宁主席、莫洛托夫副主席兼外长，代表中华人民共和国政府和人民，向苏联政府和伟大的苏联人民及其军队致热烈的祝贺和衷心的感谢；并派出了以国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀为首的代表团，到旅顺口地区慰问苏联驻军，表达我国政府和人民对他们的深切敬意，代表我国政府和人民向英雄的苏联军队表示热烈的祝贺。
    苏联军队是苏维埃社会主义国家劳动人民的优秀子弟所组成的、用马克思列宁主义的思想武装起来的、伟大的爱国主义的和国际主义的军队。它是苏联共产主义建设的坚强保卫者，也是全世界和平民主和社会主义事业的坚强保卫者。它在自己还十分年轻的时候，就以无比的英勇和机智击败了十四个帝国主义国家对苏维埃国家的进犯，粉碎了无数次由帝国主义国家支持的国内反革命暴乱，使得帝国主义不得不承认苏维埃国家伟大的存在。在第二次世界大战中，苏联军队彻底粉碎了企图独霸全世界的疯狂的德国法西斯军队，不但保卫了自己的苏维埃国家，而且解放了欧洲许多国家。一九四五年八月，这支军队更以排山倒海之势，在很短时间内粉碎了日本帝国主义最精锐的关东军，解放了我国东北和朝鲜北部。但是苏联军队从来不侵犯任何国家的主权和领土完整，它把自己在追歼侵略者过程中所解放了的别国的大量土地，无条件地交还了各国人民自己去掌握管理。被解放了的国家的人民以及全世界爱好和平的人民，都把苏联军队看成是他们自己最亲切的朋友和世界和平的坚强保卫者。中国人民特别清楚地看到苏维埃国家和它的军队，同我们自己祖国的安全和建设事业有多么密切的关系，同远东和世界的和平有多么密切的关系！
    历史已经证明了，并且还将继续证明这种关系的巨大意义和作用。正如毛泽东主席、刘少奇委员长、周恩来总理在祝贺苏联军队建军三十七周年的电文中所说的：“正当帝国主义战争集团加紧制造国际紧张局势、准备原子战争、进行战争挑衅、严重地威胁世界和平的时候，强大的和久经考验的苏联军队乃是保卫世界和平的不可战胜的力量。”
    驻防旅顺口海军根据地的苏联军队，从一九五零年二月中苏两国订立友好同盟互助条约和关于中国长春铁路、旅顺口及大连的协定的时候起，就同中国人民解放军亲密地合作，共同为“防止日本帝国主义之再起及日本或其他用任何形式在侵略行为上与日本相勾结的国家之重新侵略”而奋斗。一九五一年九月美国公然签订了排斥中国和苏联的片面对日和约，并且同日本签订了所谓美日安全条约和美日行政协定，把日本放在美国长期军事占领之下，企图使日本成为美国侵略亚洲的打手。当时美国正在扩大侵略朝鲜的战争，美国空军不断地侵扰我国东北地区，向中朝两国人民进行灭绝人性的细菌战争，并且正在指使蒋介石卖国集团企图袭扰我国大陆；这些都严重地威胁着我国的安全，严重地威胁着远东和世界和平。根据这种形势，在一九五二年九月，按照协定苏联军队应从旅顺口海军根据地撤走的时候，经我国政府提议和苏联政府同意，中苏两国又决定延长共同使用旅顺口海军根据地的期限。后来由于中苏两国和其他爱好和平国家的努力，朝鲜和印度支那的战争先后停止了，日内瓦会议的成就使国际紧张局势有了某些缓和，日本人民为独立、民主、和平而进行的斗争正在高涨；同时，我国在苏联无私的援助下，迅速增强了自己的国防力量。因此，中苏两国政府在一九五四年十月发表了对日本关系的联合宣言，表示愿意采取步骤使中日、苏日的关系正常化，并愿支持日本在这方面所做的努力；中苏两国议定在一九五五年五月三十一日以前撤走旅顺口海军根据地的苏联军队。这一系列的措施都完全符合于我国人民的切身利益，符合于远东和世界和平的需要，因而受到了我国人民和其他各国爱好和平人民的拥护和赞扬。
    但是，我国同意苏联军队撤离旅顺口海军根据地，由我们的人民解放军自己完全担负起守卫海防的任务，这决不是说，我们的海防已经完全没有问题了，我们对于帝国主义侵略集团的冒险计划和冒险行动就放松了警惕。完全不是这样！我们随时都在警惕着美国侵略集团制造新战争的阴谋，随时都要准备给予新战争挑拨者的狂妄举动以坚决的打击。
    目前美国侵略集团还继续加紧在重新武装西德，企图复活日本的军国主义，打算在西方通过巴黎协定，在东方通过马尼拉条约，来拼凑侵略军队；并且肆无忌惮地干涉许多国家的内政，侵占许多国家的领土作为美国的军事基地，来威胁和包围我国和苏联及各人民民主国家。美国侵略集团不但在极力制造国际的紧张局势，而且日益疯狂地进行原子战争的叫嚣和吓诈。对于台湾问题，美国完全不顾历史事实，不顾国际协议，蛮横无理地干涉我国人民解放自己的领土台湾消灭蒋介石卖国集团的斗争。美国国务卿杜勒斯本月十六日在外交政策协会发表的关于美国外交政策的演说，公然要求进一步建立一个北起阿留申群岛、一直延伸到南太平洋的
  “大弧形”，用以包围我国，侵略亚洲；他狂妄地声称要把我国领土台湾、澎湖变成美国“西太平洋防御体系”的“一个重要部分”，声称美国将用它的武装力量来“保护”台湾、澎湖以及“有关的阵地和领土”。然而，像杜勒斯那样的狂人是会受到更严重的教训的。正义是属于我们的，有着中苏两国八万万人民的强大力量，有着社会主义阵营各国和全世界爱好和平人民的支持，我们的正义事业一定是要胜利的。我们是坚决保卫和平、反对战争的，而帝国主义侵略集团如果一定要把战争加到我们的头上，我们也是决不害怕反抗侵略的战争的。
    毛泽东主席在中苏友好同盟互助条约签订五周年的时候说：
        “我们大家可以看到，在我们中苏两国的伟
  大合作下，一切帝国主义的侵略计划，没有不能
  被粉碎的。它们一定要被彻底粉碎。只要帝国主
  义发动侵略战争，我们和全世界人民就一定要将
  它们从地球上消灭干净！”这就是我们不可动摇的信念和决心！
    我国的国防力量，得到苏联的帮助正在各方面日益强大起来。在我国和苏联共同使用旅顺口海军根据地的五年中间，同样证明了这个事实。我国海防部队在学习和掌握先进的军事科学方面，在装备、技术、编制、训练和指挥各方面，都大大地提高了。我国海防力量已经大大地增强了。驻在旅顺口的苏联军队为了帮助我国加强海防力量，帮助我国海防部队掌握近代化的科学技术和装备，曾经付出了巨大的努力，进行了辛苦的工作。我国人民和军队对于苏联驻军这种无私的兄弟般的帮助和指导将永志不忘。
    苏联驻军不但帮助了我国海防力量的成长和壮大，而且对当地和平建设事业作了许多可能的帮助。他们对于当地的人民群众，也像对于他们自己的同胞一样关怀，爱护，帮助许多群众克服过各种各样的困难。我国人民在历史上第一次看到了一种完全用平等友爱的态度对待自己的外国军队。对于多年来一直遭受日军、美军和国内反动军队欺压蹂躏而无处可以说理的当地人民，这是一种极其深刻的实际的国际主义教育。当地人民怀抱着对于苏联驻军的深厚友谊和热爱，也像对待自己的子弟兵一样对待苏联驻军，经常给苏联驻军以一切可能的帮助和支援，使他们能够顺利地克服各种困难，完成自己光荣的任务。这种崇高的国际主义的军民关系，体现了并且深化了伟大的中苏友谊，它将进一步凝结成足以战胜一切的强大力量。
    现在，当我们热烈庆祝苏联建军节的时候，当着旅顺口地区的苏联军队就要陆续离开我国撤回苏联的时候，我们必须继续加紧巩固和增强海防力量，我们必须更加努力学习苏联先进的军事科学和技术，在装备、训练和指挥各方面不断提高自己，把我们的人民解放军建设成同苏联军队一样的完全现代化的军队。我们不仅要有完全现代化的强大的陆军，而且必须有完全现代化的强大的海军和空军。我国军队必须更普遍更深入地向我们的最亲密的兄弟武装——苏联军队学习，最迅速最有效地加强我国的国防力量，继续加强中苏两国的军队为保卫和平而斗争的友谊。让我们两国的兄弟武装力量在为保卫和平的斗争中更亲密地合作吧！让我们欢呼苏联的军队——我们的兄弟武装力量万岁！
