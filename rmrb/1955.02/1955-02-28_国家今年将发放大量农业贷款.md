    Xinhua News Agency, February 27th: The People's Bank of China has determined the amount of agricultural loans to be issued this year and the principles for their distribution. The maximum amount of agricultural loans for the whole year is 1,330 billion yuan (old currency, including those issued in the past and not yet recovered), an increase of 200 billion yuan over last year. This spring, approximately 550 billion yuan will be issued. If we add the loans that credit cooperatives can issue and the National Bank's cashing of farmers' preferential savings deposits for grain and cotton, farmers will have 1,100 billion yuan, in addition to their existing funds, to invest in spring plowing and production.
    Before spring plowing this year, the number of agricultural producers' cooperatives across the country will develop to about 600,000. The People's Bank will vigorously help agricultural producers' cooperatives expand production investment, increase equipment, improve technology, and overcome difficulties in the initial stages of development. Care and consideration will also be given to the difficulties of individual poor farmers in spring plowing and production. In areas that suffered from floods last year, strong support will be given to farmers to restore production, laying a good foundation for a bumper harvest in summer and autumn this year.
    This spring, the People's Bank will also guide credit cooperatives in various regions to effectively lend out their existing funds of 300 billion yuan. Furthermore, the bank's agricultural loans and the loans of credit cooperatives will be planned in a comprehensive manner to give full play to the effectiveness of the funds.

    国家今年将发放大量农业贷款
    【新华社二十七日讯】中国人民银行已确定今年农业贷款的数额和发放原则。全年农业贷款最高额度为十三万三千多亿元（旧币，其中包括过去发放未收回的在内），比去年增加二万亿元。今年春季，大约发放五万五千亿元。如加上信用合作社可发放的贷款和国家银行兑付农民粮棉优待储蓄存款、农民除现有资金外，将有十一万亿元投入春耕生产。
    今年春耕以前，全国的农业生产合作社将发展到六十万个左右。人民银行将贷款大力帮助农业生产合作社扩大生产投资，增加设备，改进技术，和克服在初期发展阶段生产中的困难。对个体贫困农民在春耕生产中的困难，也将给予关怀和照顾。在去年遭受水灾的地区，将大力支持农民恢复生产，为今年夏、秋季丰收打好基础。
    今年春季，人民银行还将指导各地信用合作社把现有的三万亿元资金很好的贷放出去。并且把银行的农业贷款和信用合作社的贷款加以通盘筹划，充分发挥资金的效用。
