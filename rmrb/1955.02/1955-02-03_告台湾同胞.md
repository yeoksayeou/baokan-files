To my compatriots in Taiwan:

Everyone knows that Taiwan is currently a problematic place. Since the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang fled to Taiwan, it has provided the best opportunity for the American aggressor group to invade and occupy Taiwan; and for the Chiang bandit gang, it is precisely the chance to maintain its lingering existence. Their collusion and mutual exploitation has transformed and expanded this internal Chinese problem into an international tension. In particular, the Chiang bandit gang hopes to provoke a Third World War to fulfill its wishes. Therefore, the Taiwan issue is not only a major problem facing the Chinese people, but has also become a global problem. Without resolving it, no one can live in peace. How to resolve it? That is to allow Taiwan to return to its rightful place. It was originally a part of our motherland, once seized by Japan, and since it has been recovered, can we allow anyone to seize it again today? We are determined to recover Taiwan, and there is absolutely no other option. Any further discussion will only introduce disputes and not solve the problem. Compatriots in Taiwan, I believe you can clearly recognize this. Therefore, I hope that you will actively cooperate with compatriots on the mainland to ensure that Taiwan is recovered as soon as possible. Do not hesitate, do not evade, and do not be of two minds.

However, I know that people's hearts are not united, and it is understandable that some people are suspicious and watching. First, they are far overseas and unclear about the true situation on the mainland. I have often thought: If I hadn't stayed on the mainland and had the opportunity for five years of close experience, I don't know what attitude I would hold now. Second, the enemy and all those who are inevitably hostile have been constantly confusing the public, spreading rumors and slanders. Truly not being deceived is likely to be a minority. The combined force of these two factors, in my opinion, will significantly undermine people's desire to return to the motherland. Isn't that so?

At the same time, I know that there are some rumors about me overseas, as if I am one of the people on the mainland who insist on not trusting the Communist Party. Therefore, I find it necessary to explain a few words to my overseas compatriots.

In the past, my consistent position and course of action in domestic politics was neither to follow the Kuomintang nor to follow the Communist Party. My experiences over the years are well known and need no further elaboration. This is because I have always been thoughtful and have my own opinions; or perhaps this is what has caused those rumors. Indeed, I and many friends were alike in that we were unwilling to follow the Communist Party, and this seemed to be deeply approved and believed by my friends; but now I am willing to say responsibly: I have already decided to follow the Communist Party.

How did the Chinese Communist Party ultimately convince me? First, there are many undeniable facts, and second, there is its profound and thought-provoking theory.

I said, "There are many undeniable facts," because the things I have experienced in the past five years are numerous; and in fact, these things combined are nothing more than one major fact: that the Chinese people's fate, which had been declining for more than a hundred years, has now been reversed by the Communist Party and is on the rise. In five years, there has truly been a "rising sun" phenomenon. This is a fact, the greatest undeniable fact. It is this greatest fact before my eyes that makes it impossible for me not to be convinced by the Chinese Communist Party.

What runs through these countless facts and plays a decisive role in reversing our national destiny is national unity. From an external perspective, China, which has always been in a passive position and unable to speak of independence and autonomy, is now able to actively play a role and demonstrate strength in international politics, and its prestige is increasing day by day. From an internal perspective, all the chaotic old affairs have been sorted out and everything is in order, and all construction undertakings have started and achieved great results. Speaking of unity, friends may remember that this was my most emphasized requirement all along. Because I had long recognized it as the key to national rejuvenation, I had devoted all my thoughts and efforts to it for many years. But today's events are simply beyond my expectations. That the scope of today's unity is so broad, even the ethnic minorities in the Northeast Yanbian, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Tibet, and Yunnan are united, is it something I could have imagined? That today's unity has reached such a high degree, that everything can be concentrated in the central government, and that the central government's orders can be implemented from top to bottom without any obstruction, like arms obeying fingers, is it something I could have imagined? It is not just me who has never imagined this. Everyone never even dreamed of it, but now the reality appears before our eyes, can we say it is not a miracle?

Strangely! The Communist Party is able to create miracles! Everyone feels this way. If you look closely at this great miracle before your eyes, it is precisely the accumulation or result of many, many miracles. For example, uniting Tibet is one thing in this great unified situation; and who ever expected that this could be done? Today, the Communist Party can get it done, isn't that a miracle? Now, the opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways is another favorable condition for this great unified situation; and isn't the completion of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways itself already an astonishing miracle? But if it hadn't been for the several miracles that occurred before and after it during its construction, it would not have been completed. Using this as an example, it can be explained: it is precisely because of the continuous emergence of miracles in politics, military affairs, construction projects, and other aspects that this unprecedentedly great unified situation has been realized. And under this unprecedentedly great unified situation, various miracles in various fields are constantly being created, and the momentum is still growing. – This is also the origin of the previous saying that the new China has a "rising sun" phenomenon.

Many things, if you haven't seen them with your own eyes, you wouldn't believe them if I told you. But if you live on the mainland, the things you don't believe can meet you face to face. When you face these many undeniable facts, how can you not be convinced by the Communist Party? What convinces you is not only its great ability, but also that it satisfies those wishes that you have been hoping for for many years. Who among the elderly hasn't seen China being bullied by foreign countries since birth, lagging behind in everything, and being inferior in every way, and hoping for "self-strengthening," hoping for the day when they can finally raise their heads? Who among middle-aged and older people hasn't seen wars everywhere, people living in misery, and constant turmoil since birth, with no end in sight, and hoping for the day when this situation ends! Now, it can be said that your wishes have been fulfilled; how can you not be grateful and convinced by the Communist Party?

First, the facts convince people, and from the facts, we also lead to ideology and theory.

As mentioned above, I never imagined that there would be such a grand and solid unity as today, but what I especially could not imagine was that it would succeed at the hands of the Chinese Communist Party. I once believed that I had a deep understanding of the particularities of Chinese social development and structure, and disagreed with the Communist Party's view of Chinese society from a class perspective and its solution to Chinese problems through class struggle; I thought they had mistakenly treated China as a foreign country, and even if they had temporary success, they could not achieve final success. The person who achieves final success is the person who can truly unify China. To unify China, one must recognize that China has always lacked group life and is good at uniting and striving for unity. How can they succeed by taking the path of division and struggle? However, for many years, I have been wholeheartedly uniting all parties, but in the end, I have achieved nothing and worked in vain; it is the Communist Party that has succeeded and succeeded greatly. This was difficult for me to understand at first. But with the facts before me, I cannot deny them, so I have to go back and examine what errors I have in my usual understanding.

I went to Beijing in the early spring of 1950 and went to the old liberated areas of North China, East China, and Northeast China for inspection and visits. While observing the many facts before me, I was thinking about how to answer the question - "Where exactly am I wrong?" In addition, five years of more experience and learning have gradually made me understand that my past mistakes have their root cause, which is that my way of thinking is wrong; and the wrong way of thinking is unconsciously shielded by my class position. Simply put, because I am not a member of the exploited and oppressed class, I cannot deeply appreciate class contradictions; because I am always on the side of the ruling class, I intentionally or unintentionally conceal class and avoid struggle. Like this, relying on subjectivity and not being able to seek truth from facts is also idealism. The Communist Party said my problem a long time ago, not even a little bit off.

Just like having eyes is good for walking, having methods is good for doing things. The reason why the Communist Party overcomes everything is just as they say, it is all because they arm themselves with Marxism-Leninism. They confirm class contradictions, distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and then seek unity from a certain and unchanging class position. This way, uniting a little is a little, and there is always a future, and it will never be in vain. They insist on class struggle. Unity is for struggle, and struggle also expands unity. Class enemies are constantly weakened and even eliminated, and finally the whole country is united on one position. Therefore, differentiation is the starting point of unity, struggle is the path to unity, and the ultimate goal is to unite all Chinese people. At first, I blamed them for taking the path of differentiation and struggle, but now I understand that they are precisely good at uniting and striving for unity; it is precisely from constantly uniting that they have achieved today's great unity and not others.

Unity is to be united on a certain class position, which in China today means the position of the working people. For decades, the Chinese Communist Party has been uniting all Chinese people from this position, no matter what class you were in the past, as long as you truly transform to the position of the working people. The working people are willing to spare no effort to solve problems in a down-to-earth and serious manner; and once united, the collective will is invincible, and the collective wisdom is indestructible, and that power is indeed incomparably strong. This is the reason why things that you see as impossible are always done by them. This is the origin of those countless big and small miracles appearing before you, making it impossible for you not to be convinced. The path to success is very clear; the more you study his theory, the clearer you will become. In the end, you will not only be convinced by his facts, but also by his theory.

That is how I finally succumbed to the Chinese Communist Party.

Compatriots in Taiwan! Know that this submission is extraordinary, it makes you both realize that your past way of thinking was not right, and realize that your past class position was not right, fundamentally negating yourself. At the moment when you negate your past self, haven't you already affirmed that the Communist Party's way of thinking is right, the class position is right, and followed him! However, ideological reform and position transformation are not easy things, especially for me, a person who has always been too confident. So you can understand: although those rumors about me are not without cause, they are fundamentally not worth believing.

Compatriots in Taiwan, please don't believe the rumors anymore! Rumors will undermine your desire to return to the motherland and delay your future. Among you, some are originally from Taiwan, please believe: the liberation of Taiwan means that the opportunity for you to join the bright and prosperous motherland has arrived, you must strive for it, to cooperate with the recovery movement of the compatriots on the mainland, let the unification of our motherland reach completeness, and let us all move towards building a new society together! Among you, some are people who intentionally or unintentionally transferred from the mainland to Taiwan, please believe: compatriots on the mainland are living in democratic unity, and will be better and better united day by day; your family, relatives, friends and all people, whether related or not, are eagerly waiting for you to return and reunite. Can't you directly or indirectly, tangibly or intangibly, do your part to ensure that Taiwan is recovered as soon as possible, or return as soon as possible? In addition, there are those who have been following Chiang Kai-shek and participating in his military and political affairs, please believe: the strength of the people of the motherland is strong, the will is firm, and the recovery of Taiwan is certain and unchangeable. And in the recovery of Taiwan, it is most likely that you can reduce damage and loss; if you can atone for your sins, the future is still very good.

Finally, let me say: we will meet one day, everyone, please take good care of yourselves!

    告台湾同胞
    梁漱溟
    在台湾的祖国同胞们：
    谁都知道今天台湾正是一个成为问题的地方。自从蒋介石匪帮逃亡到台湾，就算给美国侵略集团造成它侵占台湾的最好机缘；而在蒋匪帮呢，亦正好乘机借着维持它的游魂残魄。他们彼此这样互相勾结利用，就使得这一中国内部问题转化了扩大了成为国际间紧张局势。其中特别是蒋匪帮巴不得挑起第三次大战才趁它的心愿。因此台湾问题不止是摆在中国人面前的一大问题，而且已经成了全世界一个问题，不解决它，人人都不得安生的。怎么解决呢？那就是让台湾得到它的正当归落。它原是我们祖国的一部分，一度被日本抢夺去，既经收回来了，难道今天还能让任何人再抢去吗？我们定要收复台湾，绝没有二句话说。再说二句话都只有引入纠纷而不是解决问题。在台湾的祖国同胞们，想来必能清楚地认识到此。从而亦就希望你们要积极地协同大陆上的同胞使台湾早得收复，不要迟疑，不要躲闪，不要心存二意。
    然而我知道人心是不齐的，有些人们狐疑观望是难怪的。第一是远在海外不明大陆上的事实真相。我尝想：要不是当初我留在内地得有五年来亲切体验机会，现在我抱什么态度，就不敢说。第二是敌人以及一切不免有敌意的人一直不断地在淆乱听闻，造谣诬蔑，真能够不为所蒙蔽的甯居少数。前后这两层合起来的那种力量，对于人们归向祖国的心情的破坏，据我想是不会小的。不是吗？
    同时我知道，在海外也有关于我的一些谣传，仿佛我就是大陆上坚持着不信服共产党的一个人。因此我有必要来向海外同胞说明几句话。
    过去我在国内政治上一向的立场和行动路线，既不是一个跟着国民党走的人，亦不是一个跟着共产党走的人，若干年来历：在人耳目，是不须多表的。这是因为我从来遇事好用心思，自有主见的原故；或者亦就是由此而引起那些谣传来的。诚然，在不肯跟着共产党走这一点上我同许多朋友曾是一样的，似亦为朋友们所深许和深信的；但到现在我却愿负责地说一句：我已经认定跟着共产党走了。
    中国共产党怎么会使我终归折服于它呢？首先是有许多不可否认的事实，再则有它深耐寻思的理论。
    我说：“有许多不可否认的事实”，是为这五年来经历着的事情一件一件多得数不清；而其实呢，这些事情综合起来正不外一大事实，那就是中国人百多年来一直走着下坡路的命运，如今给共产党扭转了而向上，五年之间真有“如日方升”景象。这是事实，这是不可否认的最大事实。就是眼面前这最大事实使我无法不信服中国共产党。
    贯串在这数不清的事实中间而为扭转我们民族命运起着决定作用的，就是全国的团结统一。从对外看，一向处于被动地位，谈不上独立自主的中国，而今天却能主动地在国际政治上发挥作用，表现力量，一天天威信增高的正在此。从内部来看，一切乱七八糟的旧摊子得到耙疏整理而样样就绪，凡百建设事业得到开步走以至成绩大著，要莫不在此。说起团结统一，朋友们总可记得这原是我一向最强调的要求。正为我早认定它是民族复兴的关键，若干年来曾把全副心思力气都用在此。但今天的事情却简直出我意料。像今天统一幅面这样宽广，连东北延边、内蒙、新疆、青海、西藏、云南各少数民族都团结统一起来，是我所能设想的吗？像今天统一达于这样高度，任何事都可能集中到中央来，中央政令无所不能贯彻于下，如臂使指，是我所能设想的吗？不曾设想及此的又岂止我一人。大家本来梦都不曾作过，而今事实却出现在眼前，能说不是奇迹？
    怪得很！共产党就是能制造奇迹！人人都在这么感觉着。眼前这绝大奇迹，你细看去，正是由许多许多奇迹的累积或导致而成。譬如把西藏团结进来自是这伟大的统一局面中之一事；而这件事试问谁曾指望能搞得通呢？今天在共产党手里却能把它搞通，不就是一奇迹？现在康藏、青藏公路的通车自又是给这伟大的统一局面一有利条件；而修通康藏、青藏公路这事本身不早已是惊人的奇迹？但若不是在它修筑过程中出现了前后那若干奇迹，它亦还不得完成。借此为例，便可说明：正是为政治上、军事上、建设工程上以至其他种种方面奇迹迭出才实现了这空前伟大的统一局面的。而在这空前伟大的统一局面下，恰又促使各方面的种种奇迹不断地创造出现，方兴未已。——这也就是前面说的新中国有“如日方升”景象那句话的由来。
    许多事若不是亲眼得见，说了你会不相信。但你若生活在大陆上，你不相信的事就可以和你睹面相逢。当你面对着不可否认的这许多事实，你怎么能不折服于共产党？它使你折服的还不单在它的本领大，更且为它满足了你多年多年所盼望不到的那些心愿。一个老年人谁不是一生下来就看见中国受外国的欺侮，事事落后，百不如人，而盼望着“自强”，盼望着有吐气伸眉那一天？一个中年以上的人谁不是一生下来就看见四方混战，民不聊生，变乱相寻，没有了局，而盼望着有一天终止了这局面呢！到如今，可说是偿了你的愿望；你又怎能不感激折服于共产党？
    首先是事实折服了人，从事实也就引到思想理论上来。
    上面说了，我当初不曾设想有今天这样规模宏大、这样质地坚实的团结统一，但尤其为我所不能设想的是它成功于中国共产党之手。我曾自信对于中国社会发展和构造的特殊有深切认识，不同意共产党从阶级观点来看中国社会、以阶级斗争来解决中国问题；以为他们错把中国当外国一样看待了，纵许有一时胜利，不能取得最后成功。最后成功的人是真能统一中国的人。统一中国要在认识到中国自来缺乏集团生活而善于团结、力求团结，像他们走分化斗争的路怎么能行？然而若干年来我一心团结各方，却临了一事无成、徒劳无功；成功的而且大大成功的倒是共产党。这在我起初很难想得通。但事实当前不容否认，就只得回头来检查自己平素认识究竟有那些错误。
    我从一九五○年春初到京，便去华北、华东、东北各老解放区考察参观。就在观察现前的许多事实之中想着来解答那个问题——“我究竟错在那里？”又加以五年来更多的阅历和学习，使我逐渐明白自己一向错误有其总根源，那就是思想方法不对；思想方法的不对，又是受蔽于自己阶级立场而不自觉。简捷地说，正为自己不是被剥削被压迫阶级中人，所以不能深刻体会到阶级矛盾；正为自己总处在统治阶级这一边，所以有意无意地隐讳着阶级，回避着斗争。像这样任凭主观、不能实事求是，亦就是唯心论。共产党早说中了我的毛病，一点儿不差。
    好比有眼睛才好走路，有方法才好办事，共产党所以制胜一切正如他们所说的全靠马列主义把自己武装起来。他们确认阶级矛盾，分清敌我，而后从一定不易的阶级立场去求团结。这样团结一点是一点，总有前途，绝不落空。他们坚持着阶级斗争。团结就是为要斗争，而斗争亦就扩大了团结。阶级敌人不断在削弱以至消灭，最后就把全国都团结在一个立场上。所以分化乃是团结的起点，斗争乃是团结的途径，而最后目的正是要团结所有的中国人。我起初怪他们走分化斗争的路，现在才明白他们恰是善于团结、力求团结；恰就是从不断地团结达成了今天伟大的统一而不是其他。
    团结是要团结在一定的阶级立场上，这在中国眼前说就是劳动人民的立场。几十年来中国共产党一直从这一立场来团结所有的中国人，不论你过去是什么阶级，只要你当真转变到劳动人民的立场就行。劳动人民是不惜力气踏踏实实认真来解决问题的；而一经团结起来，集体的意志凌厉无前，集体的智慧无坚不摧，那力量确实是无比的强大。这就是你看着万万办不到的事而他总能办到的道理。这就是那些数不清的大小奇迹出现在你面前，使你无法不折服的由来。其所以成功之路是很清楚的；你越学习他的理论你就会越加清楚。末后你将不止折服于他的事实，更折服于他的理论。
    我之终于折服于中国共产党就是如此。
    在台湾的祖国同胞们！要知道这一折服不同寻常，它使你既意识到自己过去思想方法没有对，又意识到自己过去阶级立场没有对，从根儿上否定了自己。就在否定了自己过去的那时候，不早已肯定了共产党的思想方法对、阶级立场对、而跟着他走了吗！不过思想改造、立场转变不是那么容易的事，何况在一向自信心太强的我这个人呢。所以你们可以明白：外间关于我的那些谣传虽不是全无因由，却根本不足置信的了。
    在台湾的祖国同胞们，请不要再信谣言吧！谣言会破坏你们归向祖国的心情，贻误你们的前途。在你们之中，有的是原来生长台湾的人，请相信：台湾的解放那就是你们参加到气象光昌的祖国的机会到来，你们要争取它，以与大陆上同胞的收复运动相配合，让我们祖国的统一达到了完整无缺，让我们大家一齐向着建设新社会迈进！在你们之中，也有的是从大陆上有意无意转移到台湾的人，请相信：大陆上同胞是生活在民主团结中，并且一天一天会要团结的更好；你们的家人亲戚朋友以及一切不论有无关系的人们都在眼巴巴期待你们归来欢聚。你们难道不能直接间接有形无形尽一分力，使台湾早得收复，或者自己尽早归来？此外还有的是一直跟随蒋匪参加在他军政方面的人们，请相信：祖国人民的力量是强大的，意志是坚决的，收复台湾是定而不易的。而在收复台湾上，最有可能让它少破坏少损失的正是你们；你们果能立功赎罪，前途还是很好的。
    末了说一声：相见有日，人人好自珍重！
