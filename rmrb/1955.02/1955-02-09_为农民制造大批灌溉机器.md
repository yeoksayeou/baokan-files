Fujian Province's machinery manufacturing industry will manufacture large quantities of irrigation machinery, new-style farm implements, and animal-powered farm tools for farmers this year. According to preliminary plans, the output of water pumps from Fujian Machinery Factory will increase more than twofold compared to 1954; and there are plans to produce 170 water turbine pumps suitable for irrigation in mountainous areas. It is estimated that the water pumps and water turbine pumps produced by the factory this year can irrigate more than 230,000 mu of farmland, equivalent to the water output of approximately 20,000 dragon bone waterwheels. In addition, the province's machinery manufacturing departments are also preparing to manufacture 1,000 double-wheeled double-share plows, more than 1,500 threshing machines, 100 sweet potato slicers, as well as a batch of shredders, paddy field cultivators, new-style pesticide application equipment, and some agricultural product processing equipment this year, to meet the needs of agricultural production and the development of mutual aid and cooperation.

    为农民制造大批灌溉机器
    福建省机器制造业今年将为农民制造大批灌溉机器、新式农具和畜力农具。根据初步确定的计划，今年福建机器厂抽水机的生产量将比一九五四年增加两倍多；并计划生产一百七十部适合山区灌溉用的水轮泵。估计该厂今年所生产的抽水机和水轮泵，可以灌溉二十三万多亩农田，约相等于两万多部龙骨水车的出水量。此外，该省机器制造部门还准备在今年制造一千部双轮双铧犁，一千五百多部打谷机，一百部蕃薯切片机，以及一批切丝机、水田中耕器、新式药械和一部分农产品加工设备等，以适应农业生产和互助合作发展的需要。
