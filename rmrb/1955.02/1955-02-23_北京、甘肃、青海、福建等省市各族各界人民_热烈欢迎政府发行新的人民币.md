People from All Walks of Life in Beijing, Gansu, Qinghai, Fujian and Other Places Warmly Support the Government's Issuance of New Renminbi
    People from all walks of life in Beijing, Gansu, Qinghai, Fujian, and other places warmly support the government's issuance of new Renminbi.
    In Beijing, many factories, government offices, schools, and state-owned stores held report meetings and symposiums on the issuance of the new Renminbi. Everyone welcomed this good news. Gao Junling, a veteran worker at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, said that the new Renminbi issued this time under stable prices is still the Renminbi we originally supported, only the denomination has been reduced. This situation is in stark contrast to the panic and rush to purchase materials when the Kuomintang reactionaries issued "Gold Yuan Certificates." Zhang Fengming, a fifty-eight-year-old worker at the Shijingshan Power Plant, recalled that before liberation, when prices soared, he took his wages to the countryside to buy sweet potatoes, but the farmers were afraid that the money would be worthless and refused to sell. This veteran worker, who now earns more than one million yuan a month, said after hearing about the issuance of the new currency, "Thinking about today and comparing it to the past, I couldn't help but shed tears of joy." On the 21st, the business situation of the twenty-five retail stores of the Beijing Branch of the China Department Store Company was as usual. People greeted the issuance of the new currency with calm and gratified hearts. Wang Gui, deputy director of the Yuanda Agricultural Production Cooperative in the suburbs, deposited 3.5 million yuan in the credit cooperative. He said, "This money will be the same in a few days. It can buy as many things now as it will in the future." Accounting staff in state agencies and trade departments also happily discussed the great convenience that the issuance of new currency would bring to their work.
    On the 21st, when the news of the government's decision to issue new Renminbi came, the chairmen or vice-chairmen of the people's governments of various autonomous regions attending the meeting in Lanzhou, Gansu Province, all expressed their strong support. Huang Zhengqing (Tibetan), chairman of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region People's Government, immediately explained the news of the issuance of new Renminbi to the Tibetan people who had just come from pastoral areas after receiving the Gansu Daily that morning. He told reporters: The Tibetan people have long hoped to issue banknotes printed with Tibetan characters. The new Renminbi is printed with four languages: Han, Mongolian, Tibetan, and Uyghur, which is in line with the wishes of our Tibetan people. Chen Erdenibaatar (Mongolian), Vice Chairman of the Gansu Mongolian Autonomous Region People's Government, told reporters: "The fact that the characters of our minority ethnic groups can be printed on the Renminbi shows how much Chairman Mao and the Communist Party care about the people of our minority ethnic groups!" He also said that the herdsmen in the Gansu Mongolian Autonomous Region trust the Renminbi, and many herdsmen have taken the silver dollars they had accumulated in the past to the People's Bank of China to exchange for Renminbi. After the issuance of the new Renminbi, it will be warmly supported by the Mongolian people. Hami (Kazak), Vice Chairman of the Aksai Kazak Autonomous Region People's Government, told reporters: The denomination of the current Renminbi is too large, and most herdsmen cannot remember it clearly. When many herdsmen go to state-owned stores and cooperatives to buy goods, they often hand over all the Renminbi they bring to the salesperson and let the salesperson take it themselves. He said that the new Renminbi has Uyghur characters on it and the denomination is small, so the herdsmen will love it even more.
    In the past two days, at the forums held by the Qinghai Provincial Consultative Committee and the Qinghai Provincial Ethnic Affairs Committee, the members and people of all ethnic groups unanimously agreed that the state's measures to issue new Renminbi and withdraw the current Renminbi are completely correct and timely and in line with the wishes of the people of all ethnic groups. Zhao Pinshan (Han), Long Zhou (Mongolian), and others pointed out in their speeches that the issuance of new Renminbi is of great benefit to the country's planned economic construction and people's lives. In our country under the rule of the reactionaries and in capitalist countries, the people suffer a great loss every time the currency system is changed. Today, our country issues new currency and withdraws old currency, and the people suffer no loss at all. This is another proof that all the measures of the country under the leadership of the Communist Party are for the benefit of the people, and it also proves that our country is becoming stronger and stronger. Xi Yuanshou (Tu), Gu Jiasai (Tibetan), Ma Letian (Hui), and others also expressed that they would actively publicize the significance of issuing new currency to the masses of the people, and if they found speculators and rumor-mongers, they would immediately report them to the Provincial People's Committee.
    Returned overseas Chinese and their families in Fuzhou, Xiamen and other places warmly support the State Council's order on issuing new Renminbi and withdrawing the current Renminbi. Lin Zhuguang, Chairman of the Fuzhou Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, said:
   "In the past few years, my country's financial and economic situation has fundamentally improved, and prices have stabilized, which is completely different from before liberation; however, the denomination of the current currency is very high, which is also very inconvenient for us overseas Chinese and their relatives to calculate when receiving and sending remittances. The issuance of the new currency will not only meet the needs of my country's national economic development, but also greatly facilitate the daily income and expenditure of our returned overseas Chinese and their relatives." Cai Yanji, a returned overseas Chinese and chairman of the Xiamen Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: "In the past, we suggested to the relevant departments to issue new currencies with small denominations. Now this wish has been realized, which greatly facilitates the calculations of our business community and will also help the development of national economic construction." Guo Ruiren, a returned overseas Chinese and deputy manager of the Fujian Provincial Investment Company, a joint state-private enterprise, said: My country's issuance of new currency and withdrawal of old currency is fully prepared with materials. The issuance of new currency is to meet the needs of national economic construction and people's lives. (Xinhua News Agency)

    北京、甘肃、青海、福建等省市各族各界人民
    热烈欢迎政府发行新的人民币
    北京、甘肃、青海、福建等地各界人民热烈拥护政府发行新人民币。
    北京市不少工厂、机关、学校和国营商店为新人民币的发行举行了报告会和座谈会，大家都欢迎这个好消息。石景山钢铁厂老工人高峻岭说，这次在物价稳定的情况下发行的新人民币，还是我们原来拥护的人民币，就是票面额缩小了。这种情况和国民党反动派发行“金元券”时，人心惶惶不安、抢购物资的情况，正是一个鲜明的对照。解放前物价暴涨时，石景山发电厂五十八岁的工人张凤鸣领了工资到农村买白薯，农民怕钱不值钱，不肯出售。这个现在每月收入一百多万元的老工人，听到发行新币后，说，“想想今天，比比过去，我高兴地眼泪都忍不住流了出来”。二十一日，中国百货公司北京市公司的二十五个零售商场的营业情况都像往常一样。人们用平静而欣慰的心情来迎接这次新币的发行。郊区远大农业生产合作社副主任王贵在信用合作社里存了三百五十万元。他说：“这笔钱过多少天还是一样，现在能买多少东西，将来同样能买多少东西。”国家机关和贸易部门的会计人员也在高兴地谈论发行新币将给他们工作上带来很大的便利。
    二十一日，政府决定发行新人民币的消息传来时，正在兰州开会的甘肃省各自治区人民政府主席或副主席都表示非常拥护。甘南藏族自治区人民政府主席黄正清（藏族）在当天上午接到甘肃日报后，立即把发行新人民币的消息讲解给刚从牧区来的藏族人民听。他对记者说：藏族人民早就希望能发行印有藏文的纸币，新的人民币上印有汉、蒙、藏、维吾尔四种文字，正符合我们藏族人民的愿望。甘肃蒙古自治区人民政府副主席陈爱尔德尼巴图（蒙族）向记者说：“我们少数民族的文字能印在人民币上，这说明毛主席和共产党对我们少数民族人民是多么地关怀！”他还说：甘肃蒙古自治区的牧民都信任人民币，许多牧民还把过去积存下来的银圆拿到人民银行兑换人民币。新人民币发行后，更会得到蒙族人民的热烈拥护。阿克塞哈萨克族自治区人民政府副主席哈米（哈萨克族）对记者说：现行人民币票面额太大，牧民们大都记不清楚。许多牧民到国营商店和合作社去买货时，常常把自己带的人民币都交给售货员，让售货员自己取。他说，新人民币上面有维吾尔文，票面额又小，牧民们更会喜爱。
    近两天来，在青海省协商委员会和青海省民族事务委员会分别举行的座谈会上，各委员和各族人士一致认为国家发行新的人民币和收回现行的人民币的措施是完全正确的适时的，并且符合各族人民的愿望。赵品山（汉族）、龙舟（蒙族）等在发言中指出，发行新的人民币对国家有计划的经济建设和人民生活都有很大好处。在我国反动派统治时期和资本主义的国家里，每一次币制改变，人民都要吃大亏，今天我们国家发行新币收回旧币，人民丝毫不受损失，这是再一次证明共产党领导下的国家的一切措施都是为了人民的利益，同时证明我们国家的日益强大。席元寿（土族）、古嘉赛（藏族）、马乐天（回族）等并表示要积极向人民群众广泛宣传发行新币的意义，如发现投机分子和造谣破坏分子，立刻向省人民委员会检举。
    福州、厦门等地归国华侨、华侨家属热烈拥护国务院关于发行新的人民币和收回现行的人民币的命令。福州市归国华侨联谊会主任委员林珠光说：
  “几年来我国的财政经济状况已根本好转，物价稳定，和解放前完全不同了；但是现行货币票面额很高，对我们华侨、侨眷收寄侨汇时计算也很不方便。发行新币后，不但适应我国国民经济发展需要，同时也大大便利了我们归侨、侨眷日常生活的收支。”归国华侨、厦门市工商业联合会主任委员蔡衍吉说：“过去我们曾向有关方面建议发行票面额小的新货币，现在这个愿望实现了，这大大便利了我们工商界的计算，同时将更有助于国家经济建设的发展。”福州市归国华侨、公私合营福建省投资公司副经理郭瑞人说：我国发行新币和收回旧币是有充分的物资作准备的，新币发行是适应国家经济建设和人民生活需要的。（据新华社讯）
