    Criminal Tong Zhenjiang, Who Sabotaged the 1932 Zaozhuang Coal Mine Strike, Sentenced to Death
    The murderer and counter-revolutionary Tong Zhenjiang, who sabotaged the 1932 Zaozhuang Coal Mine strike movement and killed Comrade Zheng Naixu and Comrade Tian Xiuchuan, secretaries of the CCP Shandong Zaozhuang Coal Mine Special Committee, has been sentenced to death.
    The counter-revolutionary Tong Zhenjiang is from Liangzhuang, Hua County, Henan Province, and is 59 years old. Tong joined warlord troops at the age of eighteen, serving as squad leader, platoon leader, and pistol team leader for sixteen years. Later, in 1930, he came to work at the Zaozhuang Coal Mine in Shandong. In the summer of 1932, the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China sent Comrades Zheng Naixu and Tian Xiuchuan to the Zaozhuang Coal Mine to lead and organize a workers' strike movement. At that time, Tong pretended to be active, gained the trust of the workers and the strike organization, infiltrated the strike organization as a strike group leader, and, after finding out the location of the leadership organs and leading comrades of our organization leading the strike, informed the enemy. As a result, Comrades Zheng Naixu and Tian Xiuchuan, who led the strike, were brutally murdered by the enemy, and the strike movement also suffered a failure. When the Japanese invaders entered the area, Tong joined the Japanese puppet organization as a squad leader. After the Japanese surrender, he fled with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits everywhere. In April 1952, he sneaked back to Daqiao Village, Yi County, and was finally detected and arrested by our local public security organs. On December 8th of last year, with the approval of the Shandong Provincial People's Court, Tong was sentenced to death.

    破坏一九三二年枣庄煤矿罢工的罪犯
    佟振江被判处死刑
    破坏一九三二年枣庄煤矿罢工运动、杀害我中共山东枣庄煤矿特委书记郑乃序和田秀川同志的凶手、反革命分子佟振江已被判处死刑。
    反革命分子佟振江，系河南省滑县梁庄人，现年五十九岁。佟犯自十八岁起即参加军阀部队，充当班长、排长和手枪队长等职，前后达十六年之久。后于一九三零年来山东枣庄煤矿做工。一九三二年夏，中共山东省委派郑乃序、田秀川二同志去枣庄煤矿领导与组织工人举行罢工运动。当时佟犯伪装积极，骗取工人及罢工组织的信任，钻进罢工组织担任罢工小组长，探悉到我组织领导罢工的领导机关及领导同志所在地方后，向敌人告密。结果，领导此次罢工的郑乃序、田秀川二同志惨遭敌人杀害，罢工运动亦遭受失败。日寇侵入该地时，佟犯又参加日伪组织充当班长，日寇投降后，又随蒋匪到处逃窜，至一九五二年四月潜回峄县大桥村，始被我当地公安机关侦悉并逮捕归案。去年十二月八日，经山东省人民法院审核批准，判处佟犯死刑。
