    Those Who Knowingly Violate the Law Have Been Brought to Justice

    Following the publication of the report "Serious Suppression of Criticism Incident at Fuxian Department Store" and Bai Liao's article "Knowingly Violating the Law Should Be Brought to Justice" in this newspaper on January 11th, we have received over 270 letters from readers across the country. Readers unanimously believe that the serious suppression of criticism by the Fuxian Department Store is intolerable. Many readers said: "Those who suppress criticism are the deadly enemies of our Party." Some readers revealed similar situations in their own workplaces. Readers have expressed firm support for the opinion in "Knowingly Violating the Law Should Be Brought to Justice" and requested that this newspaper report the results of the reconsideration. Recently, the Fuxian People's Procuratorate wrote to inform us that the incident has been reconsidered and handled. The details of the handling are as follows:

    The Fuxian People's Procuratorate has re-examined the serious suppression of criticism incident at the Fuxian Department Store and considers the original handling of the incident by the Fuxian People's Government and other units to be inappropriate. After investigation, the Fuxian People's Procuratorate immediately filed a public prosecution with the Fuxian People's Court. On February 4th, the Fuxian People's Court convened a public trial for this incident. Song Jingsheng, the former head of the Personnel Section of the Fuxian Department Store, who should bear the main responsibility for this incident, was sentenced to one year of imprisonment, expelled from the Party, and removed from his administrative position. The punishments for other relevant personnel are: Yu Xuebin, the deputy manager of the Fuxian Department Store, was given a public warning within the Party and a major demerit on his administrative record; Gong Mingyue, the former director of the Second Branch of the Fuxian Department Store, was given a demerit on his administrative record; Yu Jichang, a staff member of the Industry and Commerce Section of the Fuxian People's Government, was given a public warning on his administrative record. The local masses expressed satisfaction with the reconsideration of this incident.

    知法犯法者已经法办
    一月十一日本报发表“复县百货公司发生严重压制批评事件”的报道和白辽的“知法犯法，应该法办”一文以后，陆续收到各地读者来信二百七十多件。读者们一致认为，复县百货公司那样严重压制批评的事件，实在令人不能容忍。许多读者说：“压制批评的人，是我们党的死敌。”有的读者揭发他们单位也有类似情况。读者们都表示坚决支持“知法犯法，应该法办”一文的意见，并要求本报报道重新处理的结果。最近，复县人民检察院来信说，这一事件已经重新作了处理。处理情况如下：
    复县百货公司的严重压制批评事件，复县人民检察院重新作了研究，认为复县人民政府等单位原来对这一事件的处理是不适当的。复县人民检察院进行侦查以后，立即把这一事件向复县人民法院提起公诉。二月四日，复县人民法院为这一事件召开了公审大会。对这一事件应该负主要责任的复县百货公司前人事股长宋景生，判处了有期徒刑一年，党内开除党籍，行政上撤职。对其他有关人员的处分是：复县百货公司副经理于学斌党内给予当众警告，行政上记大过的处分；复县百货公司第二门市部原主任宫明悦，行政上予以记过处分；复县人民政府工商科科员于继昌，行政上给予当众警告处分。当地群众对这一事件的重新处理表示满意。
