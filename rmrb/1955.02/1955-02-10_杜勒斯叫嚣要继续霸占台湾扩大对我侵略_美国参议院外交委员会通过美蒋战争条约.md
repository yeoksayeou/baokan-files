    Dulles Clamors to Continue Occupying Taiwan and Expand Aggression Against Us
    US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Passes US-Chiang War Treaty
      [Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 8th] Washington News: US Secretary of State Dulles testified on the 7th at a secret meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee regarding the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty," urging the Senate to immediately approve the treaty.

    Dulles' testimony indicates that the purpose of the US-Chiang treaty is to permanently occupy China's territory of Taiwan and Penghu as American bases to expand aggression against China. Dulles also stated that the US-Chiang treaty is "complementary" to the US Congress' resolution authorizing the President to use US armed forces to interfere in China's internal affairs, deliberately provoking war against the Chinese people.

    Dulles stated that the United States regards the Chinese territory currently seized by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique as "an important link" in the so-called "island chain" that encircles China and aggresses against Asia on the western edge of America's Pacific boundary. He said the United States signed the US-Chiang treaty based on the same considerations as a series of treaties it signed in the Pacific region. Dulles mentioned a series of other treaties, including the ANZUS Treaty, the US-Japan Treaty, the US-Rhee Syngman Group Treaty, and the Manila Treaty. Dulles also said that the United States would later connect all these treaties into "a multilateral regional treaty" to "complete" America's so-called "West Pacific security system."

    Dulles blatantly rejected the only correct proposition of the Chinese people and the people of the world regarding the elimination of tensions in the Taiwan region, namely that all US armed forces withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait.

    Dulles, pretending not to know that the Chinese people, who fear no threats, will carry out the just cause of liberating Taiwan, Penghu, and other coastal islands to the end, once again threatened that the United States would "take action" to deal with the Chinese people liberating their own territory.

    Dulles distorted the facts, insisting that China's actions to liberate its own territory "endanger the maintenance of international peace and security." In reality, the US-Chiang treaty and a series of measures such as the open military provocations by the United States in the Taiwan Strait region to interfere in China's internal affairs are seriously threatening peace and security in the Far East.

    Dulles' lies cannot conceal the war-like nature of the US-Chiang treaty. US Senator Morse said after listening to Dulles' testimony that "this treaty (referring to the US-Chiang treaty) further increases the possibility of war in the Pacific. I don't think it benefits the United States to conclude a treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek dictatorship. In fact, it puts the United States in a situation where we may have to sacrifice American men to keep Chiang Kai-shek in power." He said that he "will definitely oppose this treaty when it comes to a vote."

    [Xinhua News Agency, 9th] Washington News: After the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" on the 8th, it submitted the treaty to the Senate. Three so-called "understandings" were added to the report submitted to the Senate regarding this treaty. One "understanding" stated that this treaty does not "affect or change" the "legal status or sovereignty" of Taiwan and Penghu. According to reports, the intention of adding this "understanding" is to try to obliterate China's sovereignty over Taiwan and Penghu, which has been affirmed by international agreements and historical facts signed by countries including the United States, and to describe the "legal status" of Taiwan and Penghu as an unresolved issue. News reports say that some people in the US ruling clique are worried that the US-Chiang treaty explicitly recognizes that Taiwan and Penghu are Chinese territories, which is tantamount to admitting that the US is interfering in China's internal affairs by sheltering the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique occupying those territories, and admitting that the US is aggressing against China. Therefore, they hurriedly added an "understanding" that directly contradicts the text of the treaty. This kind of "understanding" naturally cannot change China's sovereignty over Taiwan and Penghu at all, but only further exposes the guilty conscience of the US ruling clique that occupies other countries' territories.

    The other two "understandings" are that the United States should "seek the advice and consent of the Senate" when expanding the scope of US occupation from Taiwan and Penghu to "other territories" under the so-called US-Chiang "common agreement," and that "neither party" can conduct "military activities" from the Chinese islands currently seized by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique after "common agreement" between the US and Chiang Kai-shek. According to the US propaganda machine, these two "understandings" are used to "demonstrate" the so-called "defensive nature" of the US-Chiang treaty. However, this kind of "understanding" cannot conceal the actual nature of the US-Chiang treaty. People see an example of the so-called US-Chiang "common agreement" in the US Air Force and Navy's military provocations in the Dachen area to cover the retreat of the Chiang bandits' army. The US government said that covering the Chiang bandits' retreat was a "common agreement" based on the "request" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, but the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique announced that it was proposed by the US government. The so-called "common agreement" is decided solely by the United States. At the same time, the Foreign Relations Committee rejected an amendment proposed by Senator Morse during the discussion of this treaty. This amendment supported the US occupation of China's Taiwan and Penghu, but stipulated that the scope of occupation should not be expanded to "other territories." Therefore, these "understandings" actually show that the United States intends to occupy China's territory of Taiwan and other islands in order to expand aggression and war provocations against China.

### 杜勒斯叫嚣要继续霸占台湾扩大对我侵略  美国参议院外交委员会通过美蒋战争条约

    杜勒斯叫嚣要继续霸占台湾扩大对我侵略
    美国参议院外交委员会通过美蒋战争条约
      【新华社八日讯】华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯七日在参议院外交委员会秘密会议上就美蒋
  “共同防御条约”作证，催促参议院立即批准这个条约。
    杜勒斯作证的谈话表明，美蒋条约的目的就是要长期霸占中国领土台湾和澎湖作为美国的基地，扩大对中国的侵略。杜勒斯并且表明，美蒋条约是
  “相辅相成”地配合着美国国会授权总统使用美国武装部队干涉中国内政的决议，蓄意对中国人民进行战争挑衅。
    杜勒斯表示：美国要把蒋介石卖国集团目前窃据的中国领土，当作美国在太平洋西面界限上包围中国、侵略亚洲的所谓“岛屿链带”的“一个重要环节”。他说，美国是基于它在太平洋区域签订一系列条约的同样考虑，签订美蒋条约的。杜勒斯提到的一系列其他条约有澳新美条约、美日条约、美国和李承晚集团条约以及马尼拉条约。杜勒斯还说，美国以后要做到把所有这些条约连成“一项多边区域条约”，来“完成”美国的所谓“西太平洋安全体系”。
    杜勒斯公然拒绝中国人民和全世界人民关于消除台湾地区紧张局势的唯一正确的主张，即美国一切武装力量从台湾和台湾海峡撤走。
    杜勒斯装作不知道，不怕任何威胁的中国人民一定要把解放台湾、澎湖和其他沿海岛屿的正义事业进行到底，再一次恫吓说，美国要“采取行动”来对付中国人民解放自己的领土。
    杜勒斯颠倒是非，硬说什么中国人民解放自己领土的行动“危及国际和平和安全的维持”。而实际上是，美蒋条约、美国在台湾海峡地区公开进行军事挑衅等一系列干涉中国内政的措施，正在使远东和平和安全受到严重的威胁。
    杜勒斯的这些谎言并不能掩饰美蒋条约的战争性质。美国参议员莫尔斯在听了杜勒斯的作证后说，“这个条约（指美蒋条约）进一步增加了在太平洋发生战争的可能性。我认为同蒋介石独裁政权缔结条约对美国并无好处。事实上，它使美国处于这样的情况：我们可能必须牺牲美国的男儿来使蒋介石继续当权。”他说，他“一定在表决时反对这个条约”。
    【新华社九日讯】华盛顿消息：美国参议院外交委员会在八日通过美蒋“共同防御条约”后已将这个条约提交参议院。在提交参议院的关于这个条约的报告中附加了三项所谓“谅解”。一项“谅解”说什么这个条约并不“影响或改变了”台湾和澎湖的“法律地位或主权”。据消息说，附加这项“谅解”的用意，是企图抹煞早经包括美国在内的国家签署的国际协议和历史事实所肯定了的中国对台湾和澎湖的主权，而把台湾和澎湖的“法律地位”说成是还没有确定的问题。消息说，美国统治集团中一些人担心地指出，美蒋条约本文中明确承认台湾和澎湖是中国的领土，也就无异承认了美国庇护蒋介石卖国集团盘踞在那里是干涉中国内政，承认美国在侵略中国，因此他们赶忙加上一项直接同条约本文矛盾的“谅解”。这种“谅解”自然丝毫也不能改变中国对台湾和澎湖的主权，而只是更加暴露出霸占别国领土的美国统治集团作贼心虚的丑态。
    还有两项“谅解”是说什么美国根据所谓美蒋
  “共同协议”把美国侵占范围从台湾和澎湖扩大到“其他领土”时要“征求参议院的意见和同意”，经过美蒋双方“共同协议”后“任何一方”才能从蒋介石卖国集团目前窃据的中国岛屿上进行“军事活动”。按照美国宣传机器的说法，这两项“谅解”是用来“表明”美蒋条约的所谓“防御性质”的。然而，这种“谅解”并不能掩饰美蒋条约的实际性质。人们从美国空军和海军在大陈地区进行军事挑衅掩护蒋贼军撤退中，看到所谓美蒋“共同协议”的实例。美国政府说掩护蒋贼军撤逃是根据蒋介石卖国集团的“请求”而“共同协议”的，但是蒋介石卖国集团则宣布这是美国政府提出的。所谓“共同协议”就是美国一手决定。同时，在外交委员会在讨论这个条约过程中曾否决了参议员莫尔斯曾提出的一项修正案。这个修正案支持美国侵占中国的台湾和澎湖，但规定侵占范围不扩大到“其他领土”。因此，这些“谅解”实际上正是表明美国蓄意要侵占中国的领土台湾和其他岛屿，以便扩大对中国的侵略和战争挑衅。
