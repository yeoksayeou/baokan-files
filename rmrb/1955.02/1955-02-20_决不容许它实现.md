    After the Soviet Union proposed holding an international conference to discuss the Taiwan issue, the American aggressor group immediately expressed its rejection, claiming that the Taiwan issue remains a so-called "United Nations project." The United States also stated that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique must also participate in this conference. The British government followed suit and issued the same argument.
    This shows that the United States and its followers are attempting to smuggle the United Nations' so-called ceasefire trick to the international conference to continue its performance. The Chinese people resolutely oppose this conspiracy by the United States.
    As far as the United Nations is concerned, because it succumbs to the will of the United States and allows itself to be manipulated by the United States, it is currently powerless to ease the situation in Taiwan.
    According to Articles 1 and 2 of Chapter 1 of the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations Charter, the United Nations should "prevent and remove threats to the peace, and suppress acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace," and should not intervene in "matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state." However, on the Taiwan issue, the United Nations, under pressure from the United States, is completely unable to act in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter.
    The tense situation in the Taiwan region is caused by the United States' occupation of China's territory of Taiwan and its attempt to expand its aggression. This is a matter of American aggression against China, an international issue. In order to stop aggression and maintain international peace and security, the United Nations should condemn this behavior of the United States and demand that the American armed forces withdraw from Taiwan and other coastal island areas. This is precisely what it should do. As for the Chinese people liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, this is entirely China's internal affair, and the United Nations has no right to interfere. Here, there is of course no question of the United Nations arranging a so-called ceasefire between the Chinese people and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique.
    However, the actions of the United Nations are exactly the opposite. Under the manipulation of the United States, the United Nations Security Council first discussed New Zealand's proposal, attempting to interfere in China's internal affairs and demanding a so-called ceasefire between the Chinese people and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Later, it refused to discuss the Soviet proposal, which in effect refused to stop American aggression against China. In this way, the United Nations has shown that it is covering up American aggression and cannot contribute to easing the tense situation in the Taiwan region.
    Moreover, because the United Nations is intimidated by the pressure of the United States, it still excludes the legitimate representatives of the 600 million Chinese people from the United Nations, while at the same time refusing to expel the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique who have seized China's seat in the United Nations. Under this extremely unreasonable situation, the representatives of the Chinese people cannot attend the United Nations to discuss issues related to China, and therefore, the United Nations cannot become an appropriate forum for discussing the situation in Taiwan.
    Therefore, the issue of easing the situation in Taiwan must be discussed and dealt with by an international conference unrelated to the United Nations, outside the United Nations. The proposal to hold such an international conference has now been put forward by the Soviet Union. This is a very correct proposal. The Chinese people firmly support this proposal.
    Now, the American aggressor group and its follower, the British authorities, are trying to take this opportunity to drag the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which has long been abandoned by the 600 million Chinese people, into the proposed international conference. In doing so, British Foreign Secretary Eden even attempted to forcibly describe this traitorous clique as having "representativeness." They actually used the fact that this traitorous clique was not included in the members of the conference as an excuse to reject the Soviet proposal.
    But what kind of representativeness does the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique have? The British people have already answered this question. Samerskill, Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee of the British Labour Party, once pointed out that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is "nothing more than a bogus government in Taiwan managing an American base." The British Daily Herald also said: "Chiang Kai-shek is nothing more than an American puppet." These words reflect the views of the British people. Even from Dulles' speech on February 16, people can come to the same conclusion as above, that Chiang Kai-shek is just a dog "entrusted to govern these islands" by the United States. This traitorous clique has absolutely no qualifications to participate in any international conference. The international conference proposed by the Soviet Union discusses the issue between China and the United States, which is invading China, and only the representatives of the United States themselves can come forward to discuss in this conference. We absolutely cannot allow the American dogs, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique who cannot represent anyone, to be present.
    The United States' demand to allow the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to participate in the international conference to ease the situation in Taiwan is actually still trying to play the conspiracy contained in the New Zealand proposal, attempting to interfere in China's internal affairs, using the so-called ceasefire issue between the Chinese people and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to replace the issue of stopping American aggression, shirking American responsibility for aggression, and creating so-called "two Chinas." The Chinese people resolutely oppose this conspiracy and will never allow it to materialize.

    决不容许它实现
    蒋元椿
    苏联建议举行讨论台湾问题的国际会议之后，美国侵略集团立即表示拒绝，认为台湾问题仍然是一个所谓“联合国的项目”。美国同时表示必须让蒋介石卖国集团也参加这个会议。英国政府也跟着发表了同样的论调。
    这表明美国和它的跟随者企图用走私的办法，把联合国进行所谓停火的诡计拿到国际会议上去继续搬演。中国人民坚决反对美国的这种阴谋。
    就联合国说，由于它屈从美国的意志，听任美国操纵，它目前在和缓台湾局势的问题上已经是无能为力了。
    按照联合国宪章第一章宗旨和原则第一条和第二条的规定，联合国应当“防止且消除对于和平之威胁，制止侵略行为或其他和平之破坏”，而不应当干涉“在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件”。但是，联合国在台湾问题上却在美国压力下完全不能按照宪章的宗旨和原则行事。
    台湾地区的紧张局势，是由于美国侵占中国领土台湾并且企图扩大侵略所引起的。这是美国侵略中国的问题，是一个国际问题。联合国为了制止侵略，为了维持国际和平和安全，就应当谴责美国的这种行为，要求美国武装力量撤出台湾和其他沿海岛屿地区。这正是它分所应做的事。至于中国人民解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，这完全是中国的内政问题，联合国根本无权过问。在这里，当然更谈不上由联合国来安排中国人民与蒋介石卖国集团之间的所谓停火的问题。
    然而联合国的行为却正好与此相反。联合国安全理事会在美国操纵之下，首先讨论新西兰的提案，企图干涉中国内政，要求中国人民和蒋介石卖国集团进行所谓停火。后来，它又拒绝讨论苏联提案，这实际上就是拒绝制止美国对中国的侵略。这样联合国就表明它是在为美国的侵略打掩护，而不能为和缓台湾地区的紧张局势作出贡献。
    而且，由于联合国慑于美国的压力，它至今还把中国六万万人民的合法代表排除在联合国之外，同时它又拒绝将窃据中国席位的蒋介石卖国集团的代表赶出联合国。在这种极端不合理的情况下，中国人民的代表就无法出席联合国讨论有关中国的问题，从而，联合国也就不可能成为讨论台湾局势问题的适当场所。
    因此，和缓台湾局势问题就必须由一个同联合国无关的国际会议，在联合国之外来加以讨论和处理，这是很自然的，而且是必要的。举行这样的一个国际会议的建议现在已经由苏联提出来了。这是十分正确的建议。中国人民坚决支持这个建议。
    现在，美国侵略集团和它的追随者英国的当政人士们却想趁此机会把早被中国六万万人民抛弃了的蒋介石卖国集团拉进建议中的国际会议。在这样做的时候，英国外交大臣艾登还企图硬把这个卖国集团说成是什么有“代表性”的。他们居然以这个卖国集团不包括在会议成员之内为口实，而拒绝了苏联的建议。
    但是，蒋介石卖国集团究竟有什么代表性呢？这个问题英国人民是早已答复了的。英国工党执行委员会副主席萨末斯基尔曾经指出，蒋介石卖国集团“不过是管理一个美国基地的台湾冒牌政府”。英国每日先驱报也说：“蒋介石不过是美国的傀儡。”这些话都反映了英国人民的看法。就是从杜勒斯在二月十六日的演说中，人们也可以得出一个和上面相同的结论，蒋介石不过是被美国“委任以治理这些岛屿”的走狗。这个卖国集团绝无任何资格参加任何国际会议。苏联建议召开的国际会议，所讨论的是中国和侵略中国的美国之间的问题，只能由美国的代表自己出面来在这个会议中进行讨论。我们坚决不能容许美国的走狗、不能代表任何人的蒋介石卖国集团到场。
    美国要求让蒋介石卖国集团参加和缓台湾局势的国际会议，实际上还是想玩弄新西兰提案中所包藏的阴谋，企图干涉中国内政，用中国人民和蒋介石卖国集团之间的所谓停火问题来代替制止美国侵略的问题，推卸美国的侵略责任，并且制造所谓“两个中国”。中国人民坚决反对这个阴谋，也决不容许它实现。
