With the spring plowing season approaching, cotton seed preparation work in various regions is nearing completion. According to preliminary estimates, the fourteen cotton-producing provinces across the country have prepared 300 million jin of cotton seeds. An additional 120 million jin of cotton seeds are being actively prepared and transported. The quantity of cotton seeds stored this year is two and a half times the largest historical reserve in 1951, and the amount of cotton seed adjustment between provinces is also unprecedented. The state provides strong economic support for the work of transferring and storing cotton seeds. Various regions have also demonstrated a spirit of mutual assistance in adjusting cotton seeds. Jiangsu and Jiangxi provinces and Shanghai Municipality have allocated 300,000 dan of cotton seeds to support Hunan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces. Shandong, Hebei, and other provinces have also actively transferred cotton seeds to support the aforementioned three provinces. After adjustment, not only has the difficulty of insufficient cotton seeds for disaster-stricken people been solved, but also improved varieties have been replaced for 3 million mu of cotton fields. In addition, Zhejiang Province has ordered 800,000 jin of Dai-character cotton seeds from Jiangsu Province, and Shanxi is also introducing the 517 superior variety from Shaanxi, preparing to promote it. At present, in addition to continuing to complete the transfer work, various regions are conducting in-depth inspections of the self-retained seeds of the masses to further overcome the phenomenon of excessive or insufficient cotton seed preparation in various regions. At the same time, the stored seeds are being inspected and turned over to ensure full utilization of the existing cotton seeds and to complete the state's cotton field sowing tasks.

    各地棉种准备工作接近完成
    春耕将到，各地棉种准备工作接近完成。据初步估计，全国十四个产棉省已准备棉种三亿斤，另有一亿二千万斤棉种正在积极准备和调运中。今年棉种储备的数量，相当于历史上储备量最大的一九五一年的两倍半，省与省之间的棉种调剂数量也是空前的。国家对调运和储备棉种工作，在经济上给予有力的支持。各地在调剂棉种中也发挥了互助的精神。江苏、江西两省和上海市为支援湖南、湖北、安徽三省，调拨棉种达三十万担。山东、河北等省也调出棉种积极支援上述三省。经过调剂，不但解决了灾区群众棉种不足的困难，而且为三百万亩棉田更换了良种。此外，浙江省向江苏省订购了岱字棉种八十万斤，山西也正向陕西引进五一七号良种，准备推广。现在，各地除继续完成调运工作外，正深入检查群众自留种的情况，以进一步克服各地准备棉种过多或过少的现象，同时对储备的种籽进行检查翻晒，保证充分利用现有棉种，完成国家棉田的播种任务。
