Jiangsu peasants are utilizing barren hills to cultivate mulberry orchards.

Jiangsu Province's agricultural and forestry departments are actively mobilizing peasants to reclaim wasteland and plant mulberry trees, preparing for the vigorous development of silkworm production in the future. There are many barren lands with fertile soil in the mountainous areas of Jiangsu Province, suitable for planting mulberry trees. Last autumn, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry sent working groups to conduct surveys in various mountainous areas and cultivated 4.8 million excellent mulberry seedlings to supply for planting by peasants in mountainous areas. This year, the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry decided to reclaim and cultivate more than 32,000 mu of new mulberry orchards in the mountainous areas of Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and other places. Jurong County has mobilized more than 160 agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams to collectively cultivate new mulberry orchards, and by the beginning of January, more than 800,000 mulberry tree pits had been dug. Liyang County has also dug more than 696,000 mulberry tree pits. Shen Fengying, a female member of the Shannan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xinchang Township, dug 13 mulberry tree pits in half a day. Currently, peasants in mountainous areas are busy reclaiming wasteland and planting mulberry trees, and boats on the small rivers are constantly transporting mulberry seedlings for the peasants.

    江苏农民利用荒山垦植桑园
    江苏省农林部门积极发动农民开荒植桑，为今后大力发展蚕桑生产作准备。江苏省山区有许多土质肥沃的荒地，适宜种植桑树。去年秋天，省农林厅派出工作组到各山区进行了勘察，并且还培植了四百八十万株优良桑苗，供应山区农民栽植。今年，省农林厅决定在镇江、扬州等地的山区垦植新桑园三万二千多亩。句容县已发动了一百六十多个农业生产合作社和互助组集体培植新桑园，到一月初已挖好了八十多万个桑树塘。溧阳县也开好了六十九万六千多个桑树塘。该县新昌乡山南农业生产合作社女社员沈凤英半天就挖了十三个桑树塘。目前，山区农民正忙着开荒植桑，小河里的船只也络绎不绝地为农民运送桑苗。　（本报江苏记者站）
