    Just Nineteen Months

    Beijing—this solemn and beautiful ancient city, like many cities in our country, is rapidly changing its appearance.

    In Beijing, whether in the city or the suburbs, people can see not only newly built, flat, and wide roads, and newly built schools, hospitals, theaters, workers' dormitories, and office buildings for government agencies, but also newly built, expanded, or renovated factories and mining enterprises, including metallurgy, coal, electricity, machinery manufacturing, chemicals, cement, textiles, printing, and food processing.

    The progress of the construction, expansion, or renovation projects of these factories and mining enterprises, as well as the development of production after their completion, are often extremely rapid. Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the working class has demonstrated a high degree of initiative and creativity. We only need to look at the changes that have taken place on a piece of land by the Tonghui River in the eastern suburbs of Beijing over nineteen months to see this momentum.

    The photo on the left shows a piece of land by the Tonghui River in the eastern suburbs of Beijing. In July 1953, the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory officially started construction on this piece of land. Following this, the construction of the No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory also began, and preparations for the construction of the No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory also commenced. From the start of the construction of the No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory in July 1953 to the photo taken by our reporter in January of this year showing the surveying of the foundation for the No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory, only nineteen months have passed. You only need to look at the photos below to understand how amazing the changes have been on this piece of land in these nineteen months.

    This is a part of the factory buildings of the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, built by the Tonghui River in the eastern suburbs of Beijing. The official start of construction of this factory was in July 1953. By January 1954, the construction of the factory buildings had been completed, and the installation of machinery had begun. By September 1954, this new cotton textile factory, with 50,000 spindles and more than 1,000 looms, had officially started production.

    Following the completion of the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, the factory building project of the second modern cotton textile factory, the state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, which is twice the size of the first factory, has been completed, and the installation of machinery is now proceeding smoothly.

    When the state-owned Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory began installing machinery, the design work for the state-owned Beijing No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory began. This spring, the entire factory construction project will begin. This is the staff measuring the foundation of the factory building.

    Now, let's take a look at the workshop conditions of the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory. The factory buildings were built based on advanced Soviet experience. The factory buildings are surrounded by air-conditioning rooms, equipped with hot and cold air equipment, so that the air in the workshop is always kept clean, and the indoor temperature and humidity are normal. To ensure the health and safety of workers, the workshop also has automatic fire-fighting equipment and dust-filtering equipment. Except for the spinning machines, which are from the German Democratic Republic, the rest of the weaving machines are produced by textile machinery manufacturing plants in Zhengzhou, Shanghai, and other places. These machines are the latest models. The above picture shows the fine spinning workshop.

    The employees of the state-owned Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory have emerged many outstanding individuals in the struggle to improve technology and management, to meet the growing needs of the people, and to strive for the early realization of socialist industrialization in the country. The factory Party committee has admitted a group of comrades into the Party. This is the oath-taking ceremony for new Party members held on December 31, 1954.

    Young new workers from elementary schools have gradually become skilled workers with the help of veteran workers, such as Xu Shumei, a doffing worker in the fine spinning workshop.

    This is the steel wire drawing roving workshop of the No. 1 Cotton Mill. The workers in this workshop reduced the number of defective yarns by more than 60% in the labor competition, and the quality has been significantly improved.

    Most of the workers in the factory are graduates of senior primary schools and girls from nearby rural areas. They came to the ranks of the working class, quickly mastered production technology, and expressed their confidence in making further efforts to strive for greater achievements. The above picture is the weaving workshop. The quality of cotton cloth in the weaving workshop has been continuously improved, and the percentage of first-class cloth has been increased to 99.11%, exceeding the factory's quality target by 0.11%.

    The workers of Group 6, Class B of the fine spinning workshop won the winning red flag in the labor competition. They often use a short period of time after get off work to hold small meetings to study the production situation and existing problems of the day, in order to further improve production. This is a scene of their meeting.

    In the No. 1 Cotton Mill, not only have many skilled textile workers been trained, but also, in order to prepare conditions for the implementation of the foreman system, a group of young female technicians are being trained to learn machine repair. This is a veteran technician explaining how to renovate spinning machine parts.

    In the No. 1 Cotton Mill, you can see not only sawtooth-shaped workshop roofs and warehouse buildings, but also the construction of many facilities for the welfare of employees. In the distance of this photo are more than 20 three-story employee dormitories, where many workers' families have already settled. In the foreground of the photo are the employee dormitories of the No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory, which are under construction.

    只不过是十九个月
    北京——这座庄严秀丽的古城，和我国许多城市一样，在迅速地改变着面貌。
    在北京的城里或郊区，人们不仅可以看到一条条新修筑的平坦宽敞的马路和一幢幢新建的学校、医院、剧院、工人宿舍、机关办公大楼，而且，还可以看到一个个新建、扩建或改建的厂矿企业，这里面包括冶金、煤炭、电力、机器制造、化学、水泥、纺织、印刷和食品等各种各样的厂矿企业。
    这些厂矿企业的新建、扩建或改建工程的进展，和建成后厂矿生产的发展，许多都是极其迅速的。在党和人民政府的领导下，工人阶级发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。我们只要看一看北京东郊通惠河边的一块土地上十九个月的变化，就可以看出这一声势。
    左边这张照片，是北京东郊通惠河边的一块土地。一九五三年七月，就是在这块土地上，国营北京第一棉纺织厂正式开工兴建了，接着第二棉纺织厂的兴建工程也开始了，第三棉纺织厂也开始了施工兴建的准备工作。从一九五三年七月第一棉纺织厂兴建工程开始起，到本报记者今年一月拍摄第三棉纺织厂厂房地基测量工作的照片止，只不过十九个月的时间。你只要看看下面这些照片，就会明白在这块土地上十九个月的变化是多么的惊人啊。
                          本期画刊摄影：袁毅平、王志渊、张力
    这是建筑在北京东郊通惠河边的国营北京第一棉纺织厂厂房的一部分。这个厂的正式开工兴建是一九五三年七月。到一九五四年一月厂房建筑工程已经完成，并开始安装机器。到一九五四年九月，这座拥有五万纱锭、一千多台织布机的新型的棉纺织厂已经正式开工生产。
    继国营北京第一棉纺织厂建成之后，规模比一厂还大一倍的第二座近代化棉纺织厂——国营北京第二棉纺织厂的厂房工程已经完成，现在机器安装工作正在顺利进行。
    当国营北京第二棉纺织厂动手安装机器的时候，国营北京第三棉纺织厂的设计工作就开始了。今年春天，全部建厂工程就要开始。这是工作人员在测量厂房地基。
    现在，再来看看国营北京第一棉纺织厂的车间情况吧。这个厂的厂房是根据苏联先进经验建成的，厂房四周有空气调节室，装置着冷热风设备，使车间空气始终保持清洁，室内温度湿度正常。为保证工人的健康和安全，车间还有自动消防设备和滤尘设备。厂里的机器除纺机是来自德意志民主共和国的外，其余的织布机器都是郑州、上海等地纺织机械制造厂的出品。这些机器都是最新式的。上图是细纱车间。
    国营北京第一棉纺织厂的职工们在为提高技术和管理水平、为满足人民日益增长的需要、为争取国家早日实现社会主义工业化的斗争中，涌现出许多优秀分子。工厂党委会已经接收了一批同志入党。这是一九五四年十二月三十一日举行的新党员入党宣誓大会。
    从小学校里来的青年新工人，在老工人的帮助下，都逐渐成为熟练的工人了，像细纱车间的落纱工人徐淑美就是其中的一个。
    这是国棉一厂钢丝并条粗纱车间。这个车间里的工人，在劳动竞赛中减少了坏纱百分之六十以上，质量有了显著的提高。
    厂里的工人大部分是高小毕业生和附近农村里的姑娘。他们来到工人阶级的行列里，很快地掌握了生产技术，并且满怀信心地表示要再作进一步的努力，争取更大的成绩。上图是织布车间。织布车间的棉布质量不断提高，正布率已提高到百分之九十九点一一，超过了厂里质量指标零点一一。
    细纱车间乙班六组的工人，在劳动竞赛中获得了优胜红旗。他们常常利用下班后一段短短的时间，举行小型会议，研究当天的生产情况和存在的问题，以便进一步提高生产。这是他们开会的情形。
    在国棉一厂不仅培养了很多熟练的纺织工人，而且，为了实行工长制准备条件，也正在培养一批年青的女技工，学习机器修理。这是老技术工人在讲解如何装修纺机机件的情形。
    在国棉一厂，不只看到一片锯齿形的车间房顶和仓库等建筑，同时，还有为职工生活福利的许多设备的建筑。这张照片的远处是二十几幢三层楼房的职工宿舍，这里已经安寓下许多工人的家庭。照片的近处是正在建筑中的第二棉纺织厂的职工宿舍。
