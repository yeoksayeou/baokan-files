Comrades! Our country, under the leadership of the Communist Party, has achieved new successes in the development of the national economy and the improvement of the welfare of the working people in recent times. Our achievements in socialist industry are particularly striking.

As in the past, the Party regards the development of heavy industry as the primary task, because only on the basis of the development of heavy industry can we develop the entire national economy, including light industry, the food industry, and other industrial sectors, as well as agriculture. The production of metals, machinery, and electricity is increasing year by year, as is the production of coal and oil. On the basis of the ever-growing development of heavy industry, the production of textiles, clothing, footwear, and other consumer goods is expanding. Industrial construction, cultural and welfare construction, and housing construction are all proceeding on a large scale.

In the first four years of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, the total investment in industry by the state was double that of the same period in the Fourth Five-Year Plan. Last year, all sectors of the national economy achieved great successes. The figures in the recent bulletin of the Central Statistical Bureau prove this.

Due to the heroic efforts of the Soviet working class, the glorious collective farmers, and the people's intellectuals, under the unshakable leadership of the Communist Party, faithfully executing the great Lenin's instructions and those of his faithful successor, Stalin, about developing heavy industry as the basis of the might of the Soviet state, our country has made great strides in the development of industry and the entire national economy.

V. I. Lenin taught us: "The sole material basis of socialism is large-scale machine industry, which at the same time can transform agriculture." Without heavy industry, "we cannot build any industry; without heavy industry, our country is doomed to remain an independent country."

J. V. Stalin developed Lenin's theses, emphasizing that to slow down the development of heavy industry would be "suicidal, it would mean the destruction of all our industry, including light industry. It would mean abandoning the slogan of industrialization of our country and turning it into an appendage of the capitalist economic system."

Under Stalin's leadership, our Party firmly adhered to the correct line of comprehensive development of heavy industry, as laid down by the great Lenin. Now, our Party is steadfastly adhering to this line and will continue to do so in the future!

Some comrades, seeing that some measures have been taken recently to increase the production of consumer goods, have become confused about the issue of the rates of development of heavy industry and light industry in our country. These poor theorists have misunderstood and vulgarized the basic law of socialist economy, attempting to use this law to prove that at a certain stage of socialist construction, the development of heavy industry is no longer the main task, while light industry can and must be developed at a faster pace than all other industrial sectors. Such views are completely wrong, anti-Marxist-Leninist. Such views are nothing but slander against the Party. This is the revival of right-wing opportunism, the revival of views hostile to Leninism, which were once propagated by the likes of Rykov and Bukharin.

The main task of the Party, as in the past, is to strengthen the might of the Soviet state, and therefore to accelerate the development of heavy industry, because heavy industry is the solid foundation of the entire national economy and the indestructible defense power, the source of the continuous improvement of the living standards. Only on the basis of the development of heavy industry and the electrification of the entire country can we widely introduce the latest technology in all sectors of the national economy, can we plan to increase labor productivity. Only on the basis of the high development of heavy industry can we increasingly and more rapidly equip agriculture with modern technology. Only on the basis of the achievements of heavy industry can we further develop light industry, the food industry, and other industries, and develop agriculture.

It is strange that some of our economists still do not understand these famous principles of Marxism-Leninism, which have long been proven correct by the entire process of socialist construction in our country. We must fight against those who believe that we can now be satisfied with the current level of development of heavy industry and concentrate our main efforts on the development of light industry and the food industry. It should be understood that especially today, when our Party is concentrating all the forces of the Soviet people to complete the great task of communist construction, and the imperialist countries are frantically preparing for war, it is unacceptable to spread such anti-Leninist views.

The Communist Party has always been concerned with the welfare of the working people and has never forgotten the task of developing the consumer goods industry. On the basis of the powerful development of heavy industry, the Party has developed light industry and agriculture and will continue to do so in the future. The measures taken by the Party and the government to increase the production of consumer goods prove this. The greater our achievements in the development of heavy industry, the more successfully these measures can be implemented.

The comprehensive development of socialist industry, with an emphasis on heavy industry, is the main task of creating the material and productive base for communism. To successfully complete the task of communist construction, in addition to a powerful industry, we must also have a comprehensively developed agriculture that can produce enough food and agricultural raw materials to constantly supply the population and meet the other needs of the state. However, in recent years, several important sectors of agriculture have fallen seriously behind.

The September Plenum of the CPSU pointed out that the phenomenon of the lag in the development of certain sectors of agriculture cannot be allowed to continue, and emphasized that the most urgent and important task of the national economy at the present stage is to rapidly develop all sectors of agriculture while further comprehensively developing heavy industry.

The resolutions of the September, February-March, and June Plenums of the CPSU determined the main ways to further develop agriculture. Let me report to you some materials on the implementation of these important resolutions.

Despite the fact that last year some regions experienced adverse weather conditions, and drought in the southern regions of Ukraine and the Volga River basin led to a sharp decrease in the total output of agricultural products, the state still harvested more grain, potatoes, vegetables, meat, butter, and other agricultural products than in 1953. This made it possible to increase the state's procurement and purchase of agricultural products.

This is the first achievement of the implementation of the above-mentioned resolutions of the Central Committee on agriculture.

The second, also very important, achievement is that the necessary conditions for a significant development of agriculture in the near future have been created. The winter crop sowing plan has been overfulfilled. Collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms sowed winter crops over 40.9 million hectares, including more than 20 million hectares of wheat, which is 1.6 million hectares more than in 1953. The area of land plowed by collective farms and state farms in the fall was 1.2 million hectares more than in 1953.

Of course, these achievements did not fall from the sky; they are the result of the large-scale organizational and political work done by the Party over the past year and the significant help provided by the state.

To fulfill the task of further developing agriculture, the Party and the government have mobilized a large amount of manpower and material resources of our country. While not relaxing the development of industry, the state has increased its assistance to agriculture. The state has allocated funds to provide machine-tractor stations and state farms with a large number of new machines. Last year, our industry supplied agriculture with 137,000 general-purpose tractors (each with 15 horsepower), 46,000 tractor-drawn cultivators, 37,000 grain harvesters, and a large number of other agricultural machines. Now, the machine-tractor stations have a fixed staff. The fixed workers of the machine-tractor stations, including combine operators, machine operators, truck drivers, and repairmen, number about two million, or about two hundred per machine-tractor station. The quality of agricultural leadership, engineers, and technicians has greatly improved. According to the resolution of the September Plenum of the Party Central Committee, it is necessary to send 100,000 agronomists and livestock specialists to machine-tractor stations to work for collective farms. Now, there are about 120,000 such specialists working on collective farms. Each collective farm has an agronomist or a livestock specialist, and many collective farms have both an agronomist and a livestock specialist.

The strengthening of the staff of the machine-tractor stations is a great achievement, which enables us to enhance the role of the machine-tractor stations and improve their work. Last year, the machine-tractor stations did agricultural work equivalent to plowing 75 million hectares more land than in 1953.

In recent times, some measures have been taken to further strengthen the leadership of the collective farms. Thousands of Party, Soviet, and economic workers, as well as advanced producers of the collective farms, have been elected as chairmen of the collective farms. Many of them have already proven in practice that even the most backward collective farm can become an advanced and prosperous collective farm in a short period.

The increase in the production of agricultural commodities and the increase in the state's procurement and purchase prices for agricultural products in the second half of 1953 have greatly increased the cash income of the collective farms and the members of the collective farms. The income of the collective farms and the members of the collective farms from the sale of their agricultural products to the state in 1953 was 120 billion rubles more than in 1952, and in 1954 it was 250 billion rubles more than in 1952.

The large-scale assistance provided by cities and industrial centers in machinery and cadres, as well as the joint efforts of urban and rural laborers to develop agricultural production, have further strengthened the alliance of the working class, led by the workers, with the collective farmers.

In the implementation of the Party's resolutions on the development of agriculture, the connection between the Party organizations and the collective farmers, the workers of the machine-tractor stations, and the state farms has been strengthened, and the level of mass political and organizational work has been raised. This has made it possible to further expand the socialist competition in the countryside, cultivate more agricultural experts and livestock specialists, many of whom have already achieved outstanding results and exhibited their achievements at the All-Union Agricultural Exhibition.

The achievements of the past year show that this is only the beginning of the tremendous work that we must complete to further develop agriculture. We will not allow ourselves to be indifferent to these initial achievements or to be complacent; we must persistently implement the Party's program for the development of agriculture.

Increasing Grain Production - The Decisive Condition for the Development of Livestock Farming

Comrades! The previous plenums of the CPSU have thoroughly studied the issue of increasing grain production. Today, when we discuss the task of further developing livestock farming, we must start from the fact that the development of grain production is the decisive condition for the development of all sectors of agriculture, first of all, livestock farming, this important sector of agriculture.

The February-March Plenum of the Party Central Committee pointed out that the current level of grain production, both in terms of total output and commercial output, cannot meet the growing needs of the national economy. If we had enough grain to meet the needs of the population and livestock farming, then our country would not lack livestock products.

Perhaps someone will ask, why is it that just a few years ago we thought we had enough grain, while today we urgently raise the issue of rapidly increasing grain production? To answer this question, we must look at the changes that have taken place in our country since the war and those that are currently taking place. Here I want to briefly talk about some of the most important changes.

First, due to the steps taken by the Party and the government, the welfare of the people has greatly improved and continues to improve. In the first few years after the war, prices were still relatively high, and many people had to limit their consumption. At that time, it seemed that we had enough grain and other products to meet the needs of the state. As prices continued to fall, the demand for food and industrial goods by the people increased greatly and continues to increase every year.

Second, due to the increase in the birth rate and the decrease in the death rate in our country, the population increases by more than three million each year. With the increase in population, the demand for grain and other products also continues to increase.

Third, the population of our cities and industrial centers increases every year. In the past five years, the urban population has increased by nearly 17 million people. This is mainly due to the fact that a part of the rural population has moved to the cities. In the past five years, more than 9 million people have moved from the countryside to the cities. At first glance, this does not seem to cause much change in consumption, because these people also need the same amount of products in the countryside. In fact, this is not the case, because these collective farmers who have moved to the cities are no longer agricultural producers but consumers of commercial grain.

Fourth, our state must have abundant grain reserves and must replenish them every year. It is a well-known fact that the state cannot do without adequate grain reserves, and it is not necessary to explain this further.

Fifth, we must have enough grain for foreign trade.

Sixth, we must greatly increase the production of feed for livestock; this is the main reason why we need more grain.

These are the main factors that have greatly increased the demand for grain in our country. Here, it is not necessary to further prove that these factors will not only not disappear with the passage of time, but their scope of action will only expand. This means that we must make every effort to increase grain production every year until we have enough grain.

In 1954, more grain was produced than in 1953. By developing virgin and fallow lands and increasing the yield per unit area of existing arable land, we can produce more grain in 1955. This will be enough to meet the needs of the population. However, the current yield per unit area and the area sown with various crops in collective farms and state farms are not sufficient to meet the needs of livestock farming for feed. And it is this need that we have hardly considered before. It goes without saying that we must fundamentally change our attitude towards the issue of feed for livestock farming. For this purpose, we must greatly increase grain production in a short period.

According to estimates by some officials of the State Planning Commission of the USSR, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Central Statistical Bureau, the total grain production must be increased to 10 billion poods to not only fully meet the grain needs of the people but also to ensure the needs of livestock farming for feed and the necessary grain reserves of the state.

Can we complete this task in a few years? Yes, we can. Our socialist economy has the necessary conditions and tremendous potential to complete this task. We have already achieved great success in the production of this very valuable crop, wheat, haven't we? In 1940, the area sown with wheat was 40.3 million hectares, and in 1954 it increased to 49.3 million hectares. In this period, the share of wheat in grain production increased from 36.4% to 44%. The production of wheat in our country ranks first in the world. Whether in terms of total wheat production or per capita wheat production, our country has surpassed the United States. Our yield per unit area is still increasing, and we are also developing virgin and fallow lands, which indicates that our wheat production can continue to increase. However, the situation is far from this good in the case of feed crops.

By what means can we raise grain production to the level we need in the next five or six years?

Increasing the grain production of existing arable land (by reducing losses during harvesting and increasing the yield per unit area);

Further expanding the area sown with grain on virgin and fallow lands;

Greatly expanding the area sown with maize.

Comrade Khrushchev then detailed the above methods.

When talking about further increasing the grain production of existing arable land, Comrade Khrushchev pointed out that, first of all, we must change the situation where an intolerably large amount of grain is lost during harvesting. We must produce a large number of harvesters, use harvesters more effectively, and ensure that each farm completes the harvesting work within a maximum of ten working days.

The main task of the struggle to develop agriculture will continue to be the effort to increase the yield per unit area. We must persistently raise the level of crop cultivation, cultivate more timely according to agricultural technology, and widely apply advanced experience and scientific achievements on a large scale.

The easiest and fastest way to further increase grain production is to develop virgin and fallow lands. Last year, we did a lot of work in this area, and the experience has proven that this policy is correct. The grain production in the western regions of Siberia increased by a factor of two compared to 1953, and the grain production in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic increased by 35%. The grain production in the Altai Territory increased by nearly three times. It was precisely the increase in the yield per unit area and the development of virgin lands in these regions that compensated for the decrease in grain production in our country due to drought in some southern regions.

The Party Central Committee and the Council of Ministers decided that by 1956, the area sown with grain on newly developed lands should be at least 28 million to 30 million hectares. If the average yield per hectare is at least one ton of grain, then the total will be close to 18 billion poods.

When further discussing the issue of expanding the area sown with maize, Comrade Khrushchev pointed out that the United States mainly increased the total grain production by expanding the area sown with maize. In the United States, maize is the highest-yielding crop. In 1953, the area sown with maize in the United States accounted for 35% of the total grain area, about 30 million hectares, equal to the area sown with wheat; the production of maize was 45 billion poods, accounting for 55% of the total grain production. Almost all of the maize in the United States is used as feed. In addition, there are 3-4 million hectares of maize used as green feed. It is precisely because of maize that the United States has been able to highly develop its livestock farming.

In 1953, the area sown with maize in the Soviet Union was only 3.5 million hectares, accounting for 3.3% of the total grain area, and the harvest of maize was only 2.3 billion poods.

Comrade Khrushchev said that the best way to increase grain production is to expand the area sown with maize. If we increase the area sown with maize from 3.5 million hectares in 1953 to at least 28 million hectares by 1960, we can greatly increase the grain production in our country. We have a tremendous potential to plant a large amount of maize, and if we do not use this good method to expand the area sown with maize, it is inexcusable.

Maize is a valuable crop because it has two advantages: it can provide more grain, and its stalks can be made into good green feed. With such a large area sown with maize and timely and proper harvesting, both grain and maize stalks can be cut into small pieces and stored in cellars as juicy feed. The separated maize cobs must be turned into green feed as grain feed for pigs and other livestock and poultry; the maize stalks must be stored separately as juicy feed for dairy cows and other livestock.

Comrade Khrushchev continued, saying that in recent years, especially last year, we have tried to plant maize in different regions of our country, and the results have been that wherever the cultivation is careful, even in the northern regions, a good harvest has been obtained.

We have achieved good results in the first year of large-scale maize planting in the central and northern regions, not only in individual collective farms but also in entire districts and regions. We must further expand the planting of maize on a large scale in various regions of our country.

Comrade Khrushchev continued, saying, comrades, if the total grain production reaches 10 billion poods, it will be enough to fully meet the grain needs of the state, establish a more abundant grain reserve, and at the same time provide 40 billion poods of grain and a large amount of bran, oilcake, and various compound feeds to the livestock industry. Due to the improvement of the cultivation level, the production of other crops such as potatoes, fodder carrots, fodder beets, and ordinary beets, which are extremely necessary for livestock farming, will also increase, and the yield per unit area of forage will also increase. In this way, livestock farming will have a solid feed base for its own development; the productivity and profitability of livestock products will increase.

Comrade Khrushchev pointed out that the task of rapidly increasing grain production is of particular importance for the implementation of the great plan of communist construction. The struggle to increase grain production is a struggle to strengthen the economic power of our motherland and further improve the welfare of the people.

The Party, when proposing the task of greatly increasing the total grain production, is based on the achievements in the development of heavy industry, the superiority of large-scale socialist agriculture, and the rich experience of advanced agricultural workers. These advanced agricultural workers, using scientific methods, have already pointed out the way to high yields.

If we unite the collective farmers, the working class, and all the people to make joint efforts to increase grain production, then the task of achieving a grain harvest of 10 billion poods per year, which has national significance, will definitely be successfully completed in the next five or six years! This is beyond doubt.

Increasing the Production of Meat, Milk, Eggs, Wool, and Other Livestock Products

Comrades, after the September Plenum of the CPSU, the Party organizations and Soviet bodies, collective farmers, workers of machine-tractor stations, and state farms have made efforts to implement the measures for the development of livestock farming formulated by the Party. This work, as I mentioned at the beginning of the report, was carried out under very difficult conditions. Many regions suffered from drought, and the severe winter in remote pastures caused great difficulties and losses to livestock farming. Despite this, from October 1, 1953, to October 1, 1954, the total number of cattle increased by 1.9 million (including 1.5 million dairy cows), pigs by 3.4 million, and sheep by 2.6 million. The productivity of livestock also increased somewhat.

When studying the state of livestock farming, we must pay special attention to the role and significance of public livestock farming in supplying the working people with food and supplying industry with raw materials. Public livestock farming is the foundation; relying on it, we can fully meet the needs of the country for livestock products. Therefore, the Party has been and will continue to be primarily concerned with the development of livestock farming in collective farms and state farms.

In the post-war years, we have achieved certain successes in the development of public livestock farming. Last year, the state procured livestock products from collective farms, state farms, and other state enterprises, which accounted for the following proportions of the total state procurement of livestock products: meat about 78%, milk 77%, eggs 54%, and wool 92%.

These figures prove that collective farms and state farms have provided many goods to the market and have played a major role in supplying the state with livestock products. This is the great victory of collective farms and state farms in production. However, collective farms and state farms have not yet fully utilized the existing conditions to increase the production of livestock products.

In the development of socialist livestock farming, we must not underestimate the private livestock farming of collective farmers, workers, and employees, which is carried out according to the charter of agricultural labor associations and is for private consumption only. The Party and the government have always been and will continue to be encouraging collective farmers, workers, and employees to raise livestock, because this can improve the welfare of the people. However, the focus should be on the development of public livestock farming, because public livestock farming must play a decisive role in providing the state with abundant agricultural products and consumer goods.

I have already cited some figures to show that the number of livestock in our country has increased, and therefore the procurement of meat, milk, butter, and eggs has increased. However, livestock products are still insufficient. Why is this? First of all, because the consumption has increased greatly. After several price reductions, the demand for livestock products has increased greatly. In 1954, the amount of meat sold to residents increased to 2.8 times that of 1940, butter 2.6 times, eggs 1.4 times, and woolen goods about 3 times. The demand for livestock products will continue to increase. We must use all means to meet this demand, because for the Communist Party and the Soviet government, there is nothing more important than caring for the welfare of the people.

From the point of view of the increase in the demand for livestock products, the level of livestock production is obviously not high enough. Therefore, it is necessary to greatly increase the production of meat, milk, butter, eggs, wool, and other products.

When determining the ability of collective farms and state farms to produce livestock products, we must start from the quantity and quality of the land they possess, and we must consider that the development of livestock farming directly depends on the existing land and the correct use of the land. Therefore, when planning the production of butter and milk, it should be based on 100 hectares of arable land, meadows, and pastures; when calculating the production of pork, it should be based on 100 hectares of arable land; when calculating the production of poultry, it should be based on 100 hectares of land sown with grain. This principle must be followed when formulating plans for the development of public livestock farming. To ensure the food supply for the entire population of the country according to scientific standards, each 100 hectares of arable land, meadows, and pastures must produce an average of 2.7 tons of meat and 26 tons of milk per year, each 100 hectares of arable land must produce at least 3 tons of pork, and each 100 hectares of land sown with grain must produce at least 74,000 eggs. It should also be noted that the scientific standards on which this calculation is based should not be considered as immutable. Undoubtedly, actual life will correct this standard and make it more accurate.

Now, we are still seriously lagging behind the level that should be achieved to meet the needs of the country. However, this lag can be overcome in a short period.

For this, we first of all require a great increase in the productivity of livestock and an increase in the number of livestock.

The draft resolution submitted to the Plenum of the Central Committee for review proposes an important national economic task: by 1960, the production of the main livestock products in the country should be increased as follows compared to 1954:

Meat and various fats - by 100%

Milk - by 100%

Eggs - by 120%

Various wool - by 80%

To ensure the rapid development of livestock farming according to this plan, the entire Party and the country must pay attention to this economic sector.

It should be noted that some Party organizations have not yet realized the extent to which our livestock farming is lagging behind, and their implementation of the resolutions of the September Plenum of the Central Committee is still unsatisfactory. Despite the serious warnings of the Central Committee, last year some republics, territories, and regions not only did not increase the number of livestock and improve productivity but actually reduced the number of livestock and lowered productivity. How else can this fact be explained if not by the reasons mentioned above?

One of the reasons for the lag in the production of livestock products is the serious shortcomings in the planning of livestock farming. The leaders of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of State Farms actually formulated plans based on the incorrect assumption that increasing the number of livestock would solve the problem of livestock farming.

This could not but lead to the phenomenon that has actually occurred in some regions: although the task of increasing the number of livestock was completed, the production of livestock products decreased year by year.

Comrade Khrushchev said that livestock farming is not a zoo where an excellent manager can raise various animals. Any livestock should not be raised for the sake of raising but to obtain livestock products. When formulating plans, the main goal should not be overlooked, which is to obtain the required amount of milk, meat, and butter within the period specified by the state. To obtain the required amount of milk, meat, and butter with the least number of livestock is to benefit the state and the people.

All present know that starting from this year, we must use a new method to formulate plans for sowing areas and the development of livestock farming. This is an extremely important measure for the development of all sectors of agricultural production.

The previous method of formulating plans was top-down, without adequate consideration of the soil and climatic conditions of each region, and issued each region a plan for sowing grain and a plan for the development of livestock farming according to the species of livestock. This method did not help the workers of the machine-tractor stations, agricultural specialists, leaders of collective farms, and the masses of collective farmers to exercise initiative and creativity but led to the phenomenon of formalistic execution of higher-level instructions.

The new method of formulating plans means that collective farms and state farms will start from the production of a certain amount of commercial products. At the same time, what should be calculated is not the area sown with a certain crop or the number of livestock but how many poods of grain, potatoes, and other vegetables and crops are harvested per hectare of land, and how much meat, milk, and other livestock products are obtained by the livestock sector. In this way, agricultural workers will pay more attention to increasing the yield per unit area of crops and the productivity of public livestock farming.

The draft resolution of the Plenum of the CPSU stipulates that the production of livestock products must be rapidly increased. Someone might ask: is this task realistic? There is only one answer to this question: yes, it is completely realistic, and we have all the necessary conditions to successfully complete this task. We only need to correctly utilize and tap the existing potential.

Comrades, think about it, the potential of our country is truly limitless. In extremely different regions, advanced collective farms and state farms in 1954 had an average milk yield per cow that was twice the national average, the amount of pork obtained per 100 hectares of arable land was three to four times the national average, and the wool yield per sheep was one to two times the average wool yield of all collective farms and state farms.

Can most collective farms and state farms reach the level of advanced farms and achieve the same results as advanced farms? If we correctly develop livestock farming, they can definitely do so.

Comrade Khrushchev further discussed many specific issues regarding the increase in the production of pork, beef, and other meats, eggs, poultry, milk, and wool.

Comrade Khrushchev pointed out that the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics of the USSR and the Councils of Ministers, the Territorial Committees and Regional Committees of the Party, the Executive Committees of the Territorial and Regional Soviets will draft measures for the rapid development of livestock farming in each Union Republic, Territory, and Region by 1955-1960 and submit them to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the USSR and the Council of Ministers of the USSR for review by May 1, 1955. This work must start from the grassroots level. Each collective farm and state farm must, with the participation of the broad masses of collective farm members, workers, and specialists of state farms and machine-tractor stations, thoroughly and deeply study the local conditions, summarize the existing experience, and formulate specific measures to increase the production of livestock products per 100 hectares of land.

The plans of the districts, regions, territories, and republics must be formulated based on the measures of each collective farm and state farm. In this way, this task will be approached, which will increase the initiative of the broad masses of agricultural workers, further unleash their creative spirit, and tap and utilize the inexhaustible resources and potential of the locality. Leading this great work of the national economy is the glorious task of the local Party organizations.

Expanding Feed Production

Comrades, to increase the production of livestock products, we must vigorously establish a solid feed base. It must be admitted that for many years the situation with feed has been very unsatisfactory. The situation last year did not fundamentally change. Indeed, collective farms and state farms last year expanded the area sown with annual grasses, green feed maize, and some other crops, and produced 550 million poods more green feed than in 1953. However, if we consider that the number of livestock has already increased, then the actual feed supply per head of livestock has not improved, and in some regions it has even worsened.

The issue of the feed base for livestock farming is not being raised for the first time. Then why have we not achieved the expected results? This is because we have not yet been able to change the minds of many local leaders, who mistakenly believe that without various high-quality feeds, livestock products can be increased. Worse still, many leaders only make speeches about feed, draft resolutions about feed, and do not organize the masses in collective farms and state farms to persistently increase the production of feed.

We have already talked about the great importance of increasing grain production for the development of public livestock farming. To increase the number of livestock and improve productivity according to the plan, we must not only greatly increase grain production but also greatly increase green feed, root crops, potatoes, and other feeds.

By 1960, the minimum production of feed in each collective farm and state farm must reach the following levels:

Concentrated feed - increased to 6,500 million poods, i.e., more than five times the 1,200 million poods of 1953.

Green feed - increased to 17,600 million poods, i.e., more than five and a half times the 3,200 million poods of 1953.

Root crops and melon feed - increased to 3,800 million poods, i.e., more than four times the 900 million poods of 1953.

Potatoes - increased to 2,500 million poods, i.e., five times the 500 million poods of 1953.

Roughage - increased to 17,800 million poods, i.e., nearly one and a half times the 12,900 million poods of 1953.

The main thing is to ensure that the area sown with feed crops in each collective farm and state farm can provide various livestock with sufficient quantities and varieties of feed. If the work is properly organized, then in any region, it will not take until 1960, but in the next two or three years, this task can be completed. In humid regions, even in one year, great achievements can be made.

In this regard, I would like to draw your attention once again to the maize, which has limitless potential in the development of livestock farming. The potential of maize in increasing the productivity of livestock products is almost unparalleled.

However, there are still many workers who only talk about the advantages of maize but do not organize real work in collective farms and state farms to improve the yield of maize...

If every collective farm and state farm universally plants maize, then in a short period, a good feed base can be established, and the productivity of livestock products can be increased.

Of course, this does not mean that maize should replace all other crops. No, without various feeds, livestock farming cannot develop. Therefore, we must rapidly increase the production of potatoes, fodder beets, fodder cabbage, Sudan grass, alfalfa, sunflower, vetch, oats, and various other feed crops. But at the same time, we must pay special attention to the production of maize, because its yield is particularly high and can solve the problem of fully feeding livestock with juicy and to a large extent refined grain feed and green, unripe maize cobs.

Comrade Khrushchev emphasized that collective farms must decide for themselves the issue of selecting forage crops. Such crops should be able to produce the maximum amount of valuable forage per unit area in specific conditions.

All riverine regions in our country have millions of hectares of grasslands. These excellent natural forage-growing areas must be fully utilized.

Many collective farms have neglected their grasslands, resulting in low grass yields. We must start working seriously on these grasslands and natural pastures to turn them into high-yield forage production areas within a short period and harvest them with machines.

I would like to discuss the issue of not being good at utilizing natural grasslands, resulting in vast areas of pasture grass being left unharvested year after year. How did this happen? Because when it is time to harvest these grasses, collective farms often lack labor, especially those that rely on manual labor to cut grass.

We must think carefully about this issue. The livestock of collective farms should obviously graze on pastures that are not suitable for machine harvesting, especially those that lack labor, adopt stall feeding methods, and sow forage crops to make up for the shortage of hay forage (such as vetch and oat mixed feed, alfalfa, etc.).

Comrade Khrushchev said that within the shortest possible time, the commercial production of grass seeds, root crops, and other forage crops must be restored so that collective farms have sufficient seeds of this type to meet their own needs and for sale.

Specialized compound feeds are very important for increasing livestock products, especially dairy, pork, and eggs. Another source of feed for livestock is the waste from the food industry, such as residue, waste grains, and spent grains. The food industry produces 25 million tons of residue and waste grains annually. If these wastes are rationally utilized to feed livestock, at least 300,000 tons of meat can be obtained.

We should also consider whether it is appropriate to export soybean meal, bran, and other refined feeds.

In solving the problem of feed supply for state-owned livestock, we must also ensure that collective farms have enough feed to allocate to collective farmers who have private livestock as part of their labor remuneration. This will help to enhance the interest of collective farmers in building collective farm feed bases and strengthening labor discipline.

Rapidly increasing feed production is a matter of national significance. All party organizations and Soviet organizations, all agricultural organizations, collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms must constantly and specifically study the issue of establishing a solid feed base for state-owned livestock farming.

Construction and Mechanization in Livestock Farming

Collective farms and state farms cannot successfully solve the problem of establishing a solid feed base without buildings needed for storing and processing feed. Therefore, we must universally construct feed storage rooms, feed storage pits, and feed processing plants with machinery.

To develop high-yielding state-owned livestock farming, it is necessary to rapidly and significantly improve livestock feeding work. Therefore, to increase the number of livestock in the next few years, it is necessary to renovate existing livestock houses and build new ones on a large scale.

How is the construction of feed storage rooms and feed storage pits going? Very poorly. One point is enough to illustrate this: in six years, the total capacity of feed storage buildings constructed by collective farms is only 10 million tons, and many regions and districts have not constructed any. Such a situation is absolutely unacceptable.

In the next six years, collective farms must construct permanent feed storage buildings with a total capacity of not less than 4,500 million tons. Collective farms and machine-tractor stations must concentrate their efforts to solve this urgent task. Local industries and timber enterprises must start large-scale production of prefabricated buildings for feed storage to sell to collective farms.

There are also serious shortcomings in the construction of livestock houses. Only a small part of the livestock in collective farms are housed in well-built and well-equipped livestock houses.

The current task is to complete a large number of livestock house construction projects according to the planned increase in the number of state-owned livestock. The construction of livestock houses and other buildings in collective farms is of great significance.

Due to the measures taken by the party and the government to develop agriculture, the income of collective farms and collective farm members has greatly increased. Many collective farms have increased their income several times in one year. Now, collective farms can allocate more funds to expand production, especially the construction of livestock houses. The investment of collective farms should first be used to develop the economy and increase the income of collective farms. However, under the condition of sufficient funds, it is also necessary to build clubs and houses. Some people think that building clubs is a waste, but a collective farm cannot be consolidated without mass work. Now that collective farms have expanded, clubs are needed. Kindergartens, nurseries, and maternity stations should also be established. We should also help collective farm members build private houses. These rural construction issues are urgent and must be solved.

Comrade Khrushchev then pointed out that collective farms must better utilize their own forces and funds to successfully solve the huge tasks of rural construction. The state cannot allocate manpower and construction organizations to build for collective farms. Collective farms must have their own construction teams. If each collective farm can organize labor more rationally, widely attract members to participate in construction work during the slack season, and thus correctly utilize labor potential, then the work of rural construction can be successfully carried out. In places where large-scale construction is being carried out, it is best for various collective farms to establish joint construction companies based on the principle of joint stock, produce bricks, concrete blocks, and tiles, and build water power stations and other large buildings for common use...

The party organizations and Soviet organizations of various republics, territories, and provinces must deeply study the possibility of developing the construction industry based on local resources. The Ministry of Urban and Rural Construction must provide collective farms with good standard design drawings within a short period, help them produce building materials, prefabricated structures, and components.

Machine-tractor stations must also work harder to help collective farms with construction. If each machine-tractor station actively helps collective farms, the construction of livestock houses will be greatly accelerated.

In recent years, collective farms have done some work on the mechanization of labor-intensive work in livestock farming. However, the level of mechanization in this sector is still very low, which is one of the fundamental reasons for the long-term backwardness of state-owned livestock farming. The reason for this situation is that our Ministry of Agriculture and the ministries of automobiles, tractors, and agricultural machinery have taken incorrect attitudes and have not solved the important issue of mechanization in livestock farming for many years. Due to the delay in work by these ministries, we still cannot mechanize the main labor processes in all sectors of livestock farming.

Comrade Khrushchev severely criticized the work of some ministries, pointing out that some ministries and some working departments and machine-tractor stations should not only talk about but actually engage in the mechanization of livestock farming. Comrade Khrushchev said that while increasing the production of modern machinery for the mechanization of labor-intensive work in livestock farming, special attention must be paid to the full mechanization of forage production, the mechanization of forage storage work, the mechanization of water supply and feed processing work, and the electrification of labor-intensive work in livestock houses.

Only by fundamentally improving the work of machine-tractor stations can the full mechanization of livestock farming be realized. The task of party organizations and Soviet organizations is to make machine-tractor stations a decisive force in livestock farming in the near future, just as they are now in grain production.

The extensive mechanization of agricultural production can reduce the labor of agricultural workers, increase agricultural labor productivity, reduce the cost of agricultural products, and at the same time enable collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms to better organize manpower (now a considerable part of the people are engaged in low-productivity manual labor). Under the condition of extensive mechanization, the labor and expenses required to produce a unit of product will be reduced, labor remuneration will increase, and therefore, the material life of rural laborers will be improved.

Increasing the Production of Livestock Products in State Farms

Everyone knows that state farms play an important role in our country's agriculture. They are established according to the great Lenin's ideas and are models of state-owned agricultural enterprises.

Many state farms are actually advanced socialist enterprises, playing a huge role in the development of agriculture, and can be said to have surpassed the agricultural production level required by our country for every 100 hectares of land.

During the period when the large-scale work of opening up virgin and fallow land began, state farms once again demonstrated their vitality and enormous economic potential. Last spring, 124 large state grain farms were established in the eastern regions of our country. Soviet patriots responded to the party's call, reaching the virgin land areas, and established huge grain farms on the vast steppes of Altai and other regions in Siberia, Kazakhstan, and the Urals, opening up millions of hectares of virgin and fallow land, and producing a large amount of grain for the state. Now, another 280 to 300 state farms are to be established. The experience of the first year of opening up virgin and fallow land shows that state farms have a great future in increasing grain production. The experience of advanced state farms in developing livestock farming shows that state farms can and must play an important role in increasing the state's livestock product production.

State farms have vast cultivated land, advanced technical equipment, and skilled workers. The problem is to correctly utilize all these conditions to vigorously develop the production of state farms for the state. However, the current work level of many state farms still cannot meet the growing demands.

After severely criticizing the shortcomings in the work of state farms and the Ministry of State Farms, Comrade Khrushchev said:

The state farms are faced with the heavy responsibility of increasing livestock product production. In the next five to six years, the state farms under the Ministry of State Farms of the USSR must increase the production of meat by 1.8 times compared to 1954, dairy products by 2.8 times, wool by 2.2 times, and eggs by 4 times.

State farms must also ensure that they produce much more livestock products per 100 hectares of cultivated land than collective farms. The productivity of livestock products in state farms must be increased to an average of 3,100 kilograms of milk per cow, 4.2 kilograms of wool per sheep, and the average meat yield of livestock for food is: 325 kilograms per cow, 112 kilograms per pig, and 44 kilograms per sheep. The average milk yield of state farms under the Ministry of Food Industry must be increased to 3,700 kilograms, which was 3,036 kilograms last year.

To ensure the increase in the number of livestock and the productivity of livestock products according to the plan, state farms must increase the amount of feed delivered by 1960 as follows: coarse feed by 1 time compared to 1953, succulent feed by 3 times, potatoes by nearly 9 times, and self-sown grain feed by 2.4 times. State farms can increase the production of feed to this target mainly by increasing the yield per unit area and improving the proportion of sowing areas of various crops.

The current task of increasing the role of state farms in increasing grain and livestock product production requires the Ministry of State Farms and local party organizations and Soviet organizations to greatly improve the leadership of state farms. The Ministry of State Farms must abandon bureaucratic and bureaucratic leadership methods, study the situation of state farms more deeply, and make each state farm a standard and profitable enterprise. If managed correctly, there is no possibility of an enterprise being unprofitable, and state farms are especially so. Unprofitable state farms have no right to exist.

While making demands on the leadership of the Ministry of State Farms, it is also necessary to demand that local party organizations increase their sense of responsibility for the work of state farms. It must be admitted that the Central Committees of the Communist Parties of the Union Republics, the Territorial Committees, and the Provincial Committees have paid very little attention to the work of state farms until recently and still consider it only the business of the Ministry of State Farms. This is wrong. State farms are state-owned enterprises, so not only the Ministry of State Farms but also local party organizations are responsible for their work.

On the Procurement of Agricultural Products

Comrades, while formulating measures to further increase the production of meat, dairy products, eggs, and wool, we must also take some measures to improve the organizational work of procuring agricultural products, especially livestock products, and to improve the organizational work of supplying these products to residents.

The purpose of the procurement system is to reserve various agricultural products, reserve grain to meet the needs of residents, and reserve raw materials to meet the needs of industry.

Based on many years of experience, each republic, province, and district has independently determined the delivery quotas for various products. All procured products are centrally controlled by the state. Grain is first stored by a certain department or department, and then supplied to the working people through the commercial system. Under the socialist system, due to the implementation of the planned economy, the state can actively influence the production and distribution of products and adjust the sources of grain and raw materials according to the principles of economic development and the improvement of people's livelihood.

However, the problem is that there are serious shortcomings in the centralized supply work that are harmful to the production and distribution of products, that is, the supply work is out of touch with the production and procurement situation of each republic or province.

Comrade N. S. Khrushchev pointed out that this approach is incorrect and emphasized that the current distribution principle does not make local responsible cadres pay attention to the issue of ensuring increased production and maximizing the use of existing potential, but makes them pay attention to the issue of redistributing national products.

Economic well-being is based on material production. Value must be created before it can be distributed. The current supply system, to some extent, makes some of our cadres not pay attention to the main aspect, that is, not pay attention to the issue of agricultural increase.

Comrade N. S. Khrushchev continued, saying that the current supply work not only reduces the responsibility of local responsible cadres in the production of agricultural products but also reduces their responsibility in meeting the needs of local residents for these products. If a district, province, or republic lacks a certain product, local responsible cadres can shift the blame to the central authorities. Any working cadre, even a derelict one, can seem to say with a clear conscience: "We have no way, the allocation to us is too little."

In the distribution of agricultural products, how to correct the practice of not considering the situation of a certain republic or province in utilizing local potential to produce these products and how to fulfill its obligations to the state, such an egalitarian practice? It is necessary to give full play to the initiative of local organs and increase their sense of responsibility in increasing product production and improving the supply of products to residents. I think that to achieve this goal, the following measures must be taken: to maintain the principle of centralization while determining the amount of products allocated to a certain province, to see how it utilizes local potential and how much work it has done in increasing product production, that is, in increasing the state's product reserves. This distribution principle is completely in line with socialist principles and is completely in line with the principle of distribution according to labor.

In the early stage of the development of collective farms, income was distributed according to the number of people. It has been proven that this method is inappropriate. Collective farms abandoned this method and adopted the method of distributing income according to labor. I think that if our supply system is based on the principle of production, that is, if we consider the efforts of each province in the country to maximize the use of potential to develop local production, then things will be correct.

The products received by the state through the procurement system must be distributed according to the principle of meeting the needs of national economic development and further improving the well-being of the working people.

In the products concentrated in the state warehouses, a part must be allocated to meet the needs of large cities and industrial centers that cannot obtain products from nearby areas to meet their own needs, and must also be used to meet the needs of the army, foreign trade, and state reserves.

As for the remaining part of the products concentrated in the state warehouses, they must be distributed to other cities and regions in the country according to the actual needs of the products and the degree of utilization of existing production potential.

Therefore, it is necessary to estimate the various possibilities of each republic, territory, and province to provide agricultural products for state warehouses and to meet the needs of local residents. Next, it is necessary to estimate the needs of districts, provinces, or republics for various products and decide from where to collect these products to meet these needs. For example, if a republic or province that mainly produces cotton or other technical crops, although it has completed the production tasks and procurement tasks of various agricultural products, cannot fully supply agricultural products to residents, then the state should allocate the products it lacks from the centralized reserves.

Some measures must be taken to encourage those republics, provinces, and districts that have over-fulfilled the planned quotas and striven to explore the potential to increase product reserves. One way of encouragement is to allocate 50% or 70% of the products procured by local organs in excess of the state quotas to local organs according to local conditions, population size, and the level of industrial development. In this regard, strict regulations must be followed: if a district procures more products than the plan, it must be allocated products in a certain proportion.

Some of the products concentrated in the state reserves still cannot fully meet the needs of residents. This shows that we must strive to increase the number of products used to replenish such reserves. In the distribution of grain, the centralized system must be combined with the independent initiative of the Union Republics, while also giving certain autonomy to territories and provinces. On the one hand, each district can obtain a certain amount of products from the centralized warehouses according to its existing possibilities and production level. On the other hand, each district has various possibilities to increase product production, improve the supply of products to local residents, and give full play to its initiative in this regard. If a district has not fully utilized its own possibilities, resulting in a production volume less than the number determined according to these possibilities, then the local leadership organs must be responsible. If products are lacking, it indicates that the work of local responsible cadres is very poor, and they have not made efforts to explore potential to more fully meet the needs of residents for meat, butter, dairy products, potatoes, and other vegetables, fruits, and other local products. In this case, local responsible cadres cannot shift the blame to the central authorities for not allocating products to them.

If this principle is implemented, it will undoubtedly help us to give full play to the initiative of local organs under the condition of maintaining centralization, to accumulate a large amount of grain for residents, and to accumulate a large amount of raw materials for industry.

To improve the supply of agricultural products, some measures have been decided, but this does not mean changing the procurement system based on the principle of per hectare. It is necessary to strictly implement this principle because it correctly reflects the economic relationship between the state and collective farm members and correctly combines the interests of the people with the interests of collective farms.

The principle of per hectare stipulates that the obligations of collective farms to the state are equal, while also considering climate, soil, and certain economic conditions of some agricultural regions. It is correct to stipulate the obligation to deliver meat, dairy products, wool, and other livestock products and raw materials per hectare, and it must be strictly implemented. Not only in determining the figures of obligatory delivery of agricultural products, but also in determining the figures of state procurement, this principle must be strictly followed; now, when the proportion of livestock products in the overall national procurement plan has greatly increased, it is especially important to follow this principle.

In the procurement and procurement work of livestock products, it is necessary to make each collective farm willing to greatly increase commercial products. We must make the procurement plan in line with the conditions of each collective farm, not propose too high requirements for advanced collective farms in the plan, and not put these collective farms in a disadvantageous position. Conditions must be provided to enable collective farms to smoothly complete the delivery and sale plans of livestock products and sell part of their own products in the collective farm market.

The task of the party, Soviets, and procurement organs is to ensure the unconditional completion of the plans for obligatory delivery, in-kind payment, and procurement of livestock products under the strict implementation of the principle of per hectare. This year, the state procurement plan to be completed by the procurement organizations and collective farms is a new and different task from the past. To smoothly complete this task, it is necessary to thoroughly improve the leadership in this major task.

Following this, Comrade Khrushchev discussed in detail the issue of improving the procurement system of agricultural products.

Leadership in Agriculture and Political Work in the Countryside

Comrades, now that we have the material and organizational conditions to continuously increase agricultural production, everything, or almost everything, depends on the leadership level of the party, Soviets, and agricultural organs in agriculture, on the initiative and efficiency of our cadres, and on their ability to implement the resolutions of the party and the government.

Vladimir Ilyich Lenin has pointed out more than once that formalism, bureaucratism, and lack of responsibility in leading economic construction are unacceptable, and direct leadership must be given to the creation of social material wealth.

The Central Committee of the party, according to Lenin's instructions, has recently taken several measures to improve the leadership of agricultural work. Rural district party committees have adjusted their work to strengthen their influence in production; district committees have established guidance groups, each group responsible for several machine-tractor stations. The organs of the republics and provinces have sent personnel to strengthen the district committees and the executive committees of the district Soviets. The role of machine-tractor stations, as an important base for leading collective farms in a socialist state, has also been strengthened. The experience of last year vividly proves the correctness of these measures.

In recent periods, the leadership work in collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms has improved to some extent. The workers of party and Soviet organs have begun to handle agricultural issues more carefully and have gone deeper into the actual work of collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms.

Comrade Khrushchev then made some comments on the organizational structure of the departments that manage agricultural work.

According to the instructions of the previous meetings of the Central Committee of the party, the organizational structure of the departments that manage agricultural work has been adjusted to some extent, and the reporting system has been simplified; many experts working in agricultural organs have been transferred to machine-tractor stations, collective farms, and state farms.

However, these departments still have too many organizational structures, and there are still many bureaucratic phenomena. Many experts in agricultural organs waste time on clerical work, do not engage in practical work, but spend time drafting orders, various instructions, and collecting materials. In this way, agricultural organs produce a large amount of clerical work, making many grassroots workers detached from practical work and busy reading various notices and drafting replies.

The connection between the central organs and the localities is still very insufficient, and the characteristics and potential of various regions in the country are still underestimated, and the promotion and dissemination of advanced experience are carried out very slowly.

Due to the current situation of these departments, there is a lack of responsibility in leading the development of various sectors of agriculture and the cultivation of major crops. As a result, some major crops and even individual agricultural sectors have not been fully studied, and these departments and their local organs often overlook the most important issues in the development of these sectors.

From the examples of potato and other vegetable cultivation, it can be seen how backward the organizational structure of the Ministry of Agriculture is. When Comrade Khrushchev talked about this, he emphasized that it is necessary to arrange the organizational structure of this ministry. He said that the most important thing is to have high-level cadres with extensive powers and fully responsible for the tasks assigned to them in the ministry to handle the development of basic agricultural sectors. They must be the organizers of implementing the instructions of the party and the government on the development of certain agricultural sectors in various regions of the country; they must strive to increase the production of a certain crop and increase the amount of commercial agricultural products.

The role of professional inspectors in agricultural organs must be strengthened. To complete these tasks, we must invite experts who love their profession, are capable, energetic, and persistent to actually engage in organizational work rather than be bogged down in clerical work. Their main work is to inspect, supervise, and organize the work of collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms, summarize and systematically introduce advanced experience and scientific achievements.

The agricultural committees of the provinces must have a group of experts responsible for the work of the machine-tractor stations under their jurisdiction. Experts working in machine-tractor stations must have extensive knowledge of certain crops commonly cultivated in a certain region. Collective farms must also implement a system of personal responsibility, and there must be organizers responsible for the development of agriculture and animal husbandry; such organizers may be selected from the management committees of collective farms.

If the organizational structures of the departments that manage agricultural work and their local organs can work in this way, then it will be possible to lead the development of major agricultural sectors more effectively by utilizing rich knowledge and considering the special conditions of various economic regions.

The work of reforming the organizational structures of these departments and their local organs is not a short-term movement but must be carried out constantly and persistently.

Comrade Khrushchev then talked about the initiative of local organs and the improvement of their responsibility in the development of agriculture. He said that to improve the leadership of agriculture, to increase the sense of responsibility of local organs, and to give full play to their initiative has become increasingly important.

So-called correct leadership of agriculture means first of all to foresee the future of agriculture, to timely discover problems, to actively promote the development of new and advanced things, to resolutely fight against all outdated and obsolete things, and to fight against all things that hinder our progress, while some of our leadership cadres sometimes do not take such an attitude to handle problems.

Comrade Khrushchev cited the situation of cotton cultivation in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to illustrate this, pointing out that on the one hand, local organs timely and actively improved agricultural management work according to advanced methods, bringing so many benefits to the state; on the other hand, those leadership cadres who became prisoners of outdated ideas, did not see new things, and hindered the development of new things brought so much harm to the work. He added on this point that we must fully support those who understand their work, love their work, and help to strengthen the power of the motherland.

We must demand more strictly of leadership cadres, cultivate their sense of responsibility to the party and the people, correct the views of those who have lost their sense of new things, and criticize them, and if this method is ineffective, demote them.

Comrade Khrushchev then talked about the leadership of economic and cultural construction in the border areas and provinces of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic from several aspects. He emphasized the great role played by the Russian Federation in executing the agricultural tasks proposed by the party, but at the same time, he also pointed out the serious shortcomings in the leadership of agricultural work in many provinces and border areas of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.

Comrade Khrushchev said that recently the Central Committee of the party has taken several measures to improve the leadership work in the border areas and provinces of the Russian Federation. The role and responsibility of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic have been strengthened, and the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of State Farms have also been strengthened. The Central Committee of the party has now established the Department of the Party Organs of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. This enables the Central Committee of the party to establish closer contact with the border areas and provinces of the Russian Federation, better understand the cadres of these places, and conduct inspections. We must continue to strive in this direction.

All the departments and sectors of all the republics must also increase their sense of responsibility. They must handle the issues of the future development of the republics more carefully, quickly respond to the questions raised by local organs, and solve temporary problems without delay.

In the final part of his report, Comrade Khrushchev talked about the need to mobilize the masses to strive for the development of animal husbandry.

He said, comrades, to successfully implement the great plan for the development of animal husbandry, the party and the Soviet people must make great efforts. We must overcome serious difficulties, and we will not be frightened by these difficulties.

Vladimir Ilyich Lenin once said that the state draws its strength from the awareness of the masses. Only when the masses understand everything, can judge everything, and can consciously do everything, the state is strong. Our communist construction in the Soviet Union has provided countless examples of Lenin's wise words. The great mass movement of opening up virgin and fallow land is a brilliant example of the high initiative of the people.

In the struggle to further develop agriculture, the party organizations have, to some extent, improved their mass work. However, the political work of the party, whether in organization, content, or form, still has serious shortcomings. Mass political education work should be lively and creative, but it often falls into old routines and general discussions. Many party and Soviet workers rarely visit the work teams of collective farms, livestock farms, and distant pastures, and rarely discuss matters with collective farmers and state farm workers. Daily mass political work is usually handed over entirely to ordinary agitators, and these agitators often work in a half-hearted manner when they work.

Party organizations must pay close attention to the content of political agitation work. I would like to talk about two of the most typical shortcomings in this regard.

First, some party workers and agitators have formed the habit of only talking about achievements and not talking about shortcomings and difficulties. Of course, this will reduce the effect of agitation and cannot help to eliminate shortcomings in work.

Second, many party workers and agitators only want to hold meetings with collective farmers, explain to farmers the various benefits given to laborers by the state at the meetings, but carefully avoid discussing issues such as strengthening labor discipline, higher requirements for every worker, and eliminating various undesirable phenomena that still exist in collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms.

Collective farmers correctly regard party workers and agitators as representatives and spokesmen of our party, as fighters for the implementation of party resolutions and the protection of the interests of laborers. Collective farmers, machine-tractor station workers, or state farm workers not only hope to hear about the resolutions of the party and the government and recent events from them but also hope to tell them their own thoughts, their concerns, and needs and get the necessary help. To be cold to a person is the greatest insult to him. Wherever party workers forget this, there must be many shortcomings.

We must also mention the special responsibility of the district party committees and the guidance groups of the machine-tractor stations of the district party committees for carrying out political work in the countryside. There are more than 30,000 people working in the guidance groups at present. This is a great force, but this force has not been fully utilized. It is true that many guidance groups have become the real organizers of party political work in machine-tractor stations and collective farms, but many guidance groups are still not up to the level of real organizers.

Sending capable cadres to strengthen the various sectors of animal husbandry is an urgent task of party organizations. The most important thing is to first select some capable organizers from party members, Komsomol members, innovators in animal husbandry, and experts to strengthen the livestock management departments of collective farms and state farms. The party branches of collective farms and state farms must better place Communist Party members and Komsomol members in production positions so that they can actually play a leading role in the development of animal husbandry. We must also ensure that agricultural technicians and veterinarians are correctly allocated in each district, machine-tractor station, state farm, and collective farm and play their role in the development of animal husbandry in collective farms and state farms.

Our party organizations must be the heart and soul of all cadre work, care for and value every person engaged in animal husbandry work, timely support various initiatives, and strengthen confidence in the victory of the work.

Our leading cadres must deeply study agricultural production issues, have rich knowledge of economic and technical issues in agricultural production, and understand issues in agriculture and animal husbandry. Otherwise, party and Soviet workers will not be respected by the masses and will not be able to correctly lead collective farms, machine-tractor stations, and state farms.

Our newspapers should play a great role in improving the party's political work in the countryside. However, some newspapers in republics, provinces, and districts have not paid constant attention to the actual development of collective farms, and in this regard, only some superficial and dull news and articles have been published. They have not paid sufficient attention to the development of state-owned animal husbandry. Party organizations must attach more importance to their own newspapers.

The organizational work of party members and Komsomol members among the masses must be able to motivate people to do their best, encourage them to display initiative and enthusiasm, and help to launch socialist competitions to complete various plans. The strength of our Soviet state lies in the unity of the people, in their patriotism and labor. Our strength lies in the friendship between the peoples of various nationalities, and we must constantly develop and consolidate this friendship.

Comrades, the industry and agriculture of the Soviet Union are continuously rising, and the welfare and culture of the working people are continuously improving. This is the result of the Communist Party implementing Lenin's policies, the result of the heroic labor of the Soviet people, and the result of their unity around the party, their loyalty to the great cause of communism, and the cause of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin.

Our achievements are great, but we must not be complacent and proud of them. We should take these achievements as a basis to further develop heavy industry, persistently strive to expand the production of consumer goods, and vigorously develop agriculture to continuously improve the welfare of the Soviet people. For this, we must launch a large-scale socialist competition to further improve labor productivity, increase the production and quality of products, and improve the technology of various sectors of the national economy. We must all work tirelessly on our great peaceful construction work because we realize that the work we are doing is for the benefit of the people and the state. This is a happy and blessed labor because its purpose is to further strengthen the power of our beloved Soviet state and improve the living standards of the working masses.

Comrades, let me express our firm belief: under the leadership of the Communist Party and its Central Committee, the working class, collective farmers, and intellectuals, all the people of the Soviet Union will be able to accomplish the task of further developing agriculture at present and achieve equally great achievements as in the completion of other magnificent tasks of communist construction.

    关于增加畜牧业产品生产
    ——一九五五年一月二十五日在苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议上的报告摘要
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫
    同志们！我国执行共产党所制订的政策，最近一个时期在发展国民经济和增进劳动人民的福利方面取得了新的成就。我们在社会主义工业方面的成就是特别显著的。
    像过去一样，党认为发展重工业是首要任务，因为只有在发展重工业的基础上我们才能发展整个国民经济，包括轻工业、食品工业和其他工业部门以及农业。金属、机器和电力的产量一年比一年提高，煤和石油的产量也是这样。在重工业日益发展的基础上，纺织品、服装、鞋子和其他大众消费品的生产在不断扩大。工业建设、文化—生活福利建设和住宅建设都在大规模地进行。
    在第五个五年计划的头四年中，国家的工业投资总额比第四个五年计划的同一时期增加了一倍。去年国民经济的所有部门都取得了很大的成就。最近发表的中央统计局公报上的数字就证明了这一点。
    由于苏联英雄的工人阶级、光荣的集体农民和人民的知识分子，在共产党的领导下坚定不移地执行伟大的列宁和列宁事业的忠诚继承者斯大林关于发展重工业作为苏维埃国家威力的基础的指示，进行忘我的劳动，我国在发展工业和整个国民经济方面有了很大的进展。
    弗·伊·列宁教导我们说：“社会主义的唯一物质基础，就是同时也能改造农业的大机器工业。”没有重工业“我们就不能建立什么工业；没有重工业我们的国家就注定了不能成为一个独立国家。”
    约·维·斯大林发展了列宁的这些论点，他着重指出，降低发展重工业的速度“就会是自杀，这就会是破坏我国全部工业，连轻工业也在内。这就会是离开我国工业化的口号，把我国变为资本主义经济体系的附属品。”
    在斯大林的领导下，我们党坚定地执行了伟大的列宁所制定的全面发展重工业这个唯一正确的路线。现在我们党在坚持不渝地执行这个路线，在将来仍然要坚持这个路线！
    有些同志看到近来采取了一些增加消费品产量的措施，对于我国重工业和轻工业发展速度的问题认识模糊起来了。这些可怜的理论家错误地理解社会主义基本经济法则并把它庸俗化，企图引用这个法则来证明，到了社会主义建设的某一个阶段，发展重工业就不再是主要任务了，而轻工业则可以而且必须比其他一切工业部门优先发展。这种见解是非常错误的，是反马克思列宁主义的。这种见解只不过是对党的诽谤。这是右倾的复萌，这是与列宁主义敌对的观点的复萌，当年李可夫和布哈林那一伙人就曾宣传过这种观点。
    党全力以赴的一个主要任务过去是、现在仍然是加强苏维埃国家的力量，因而也就是加速发展重工业，因为重工业是整个国民经济和不可摧毁的国防力量的坚实基础，是不断提高生活水平的源泉。只有在发展重工业和全国电气化的基础上，我们才能做到在国民经济的一切部门中广泛采用最新的技术，才能有计划地提高劳动生产率。只有在重工业高度发展的基础上，我们才能愈来愈快地用现代技术来装备农业。只有在重工业既得成就的基础上，我们才能做到进一步发展轻工业、食品工业和其他工业，才能做到发展农业。
    奇怪的是，我们的某些经济学家至今还不懂得马克思列宁主义的这些著名的原理，而这些原理的正确性是早已为我国社会主义建设的全部过程所证明了的。我们必须进行斗争，反对那些认为现在可以满足于重工业发展的现有水平、可以集中主要力量发展轻工业和食品工业的人们。应该懂得，特别是在今天，我们党正在集中苏联人民的全部力量来完成共产主义建设的伟大任务，帝国主义国家正在疯狂地加紧准备战争，散布上述那种反列宁主义的见解是不能容许的。
    共产党经常关怀劳动人民的福利，它从来没有忘记发展消费品工业的任务。在重工业强大发展的基础上，党已经发展了轻工业和农业，而且今后仍将这样做。党和政府所采取的增加消费品生产的措施就证明了这一点。我们在发展重工业方面所取得的成就越大，那末这些措施也就能执行得越成功。
    全面发展社会主义工业并着重发展重工业，这是为共产主义创造物质和生产基础的主要任务。我们要胜利地完成共产主义建设的任务，除了强大的工业外，还必须有全面发展的农业，能够生产足够的食品和农业原料经常供应居民和满足国家的其他需要。可是在过去几年中，若干重要农业部门的发展严重地落后了。
    苏共中央九月全会指出，若干农业生产部门落后的现象不能让它继续存在下去，并着重指出，现阶段最迫切最重要的国民经济任务是，在进一步全面发展重工业的同时，迅速发展一切农业部门。
    苏共中央九月全会，二月—三月和六月全会的决议确定了进一步发展农业的主要办法。让我向你们报告这些重要决议的执行情况的一些材料。
    尽管去年某些地区气候恶劣，乌克兰南部和伏尔加河流域各区的干旱造成农产品总产量的锐减，但国家还是比一九五三年收获了更多的谷物、马铃薯、蔬菜、肉类、牛油和其他农产品。这样一来，就有可能增加国家的农产品征购量和收购量。
    这就是执行上述中央全会关于农业的各项决议所取得的第一个成绩。
    第二个也很重要的成绩是，为在不久的将来大力发展农业创造了必要的生产条件。冬季作物播种计划已经超额完成。集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场播种了冬季作物四千零九十万公顷，其中小麦占两千多万公顷，比一九五三年多一百六十万公顷。集体农庄和国营农场在秋天翻耕的土地面积比一九五三年多一千二百万公顷。
    当然，这些成绩不是从天上掉下来的，而是为了去年一年的农业增产党做了大量的组织工作和政治工作、国家给了大量的帮助的结果。
    为了完成进一步发展农业的任务，党和政府曾经动员了我国的大量人力和物力。国家在不放松发展工业的同时，增加了对农业的帮助。国家增拨了款项，使机器拖拉机站和国营农场得到大量的新机器。去年我们的工业供给农业一三七、○○○台一般用拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计），四六、○○○台拖拉机牵引中耕机，三七、○○○台谷物收割联合机和大量的其他农业机器。现在机器拖拉机站已经有了固定的干部。机器拖拉机站固定的工人，包括联合机操使者、机器操使者、汽车司机和修理工人，有两百万左右，即每一机器拖拉机站有两百多人。农业领导干部、工程师和技师的质量已经大大提高。按照党中央九月全会的决议，必须派遣十万名农艺师和饲养专家到机器拖拉机站为集体农庄工作。现在在集体农庄上工作的这类专家已有十二万名左右。每一个集体农庄都有一个农艺师或者一个饲养专家，有很多集体农庄则有一个农艺师和一个饲养专家。
    机器拖拉机站干部的加强是一个很大的成绩，这使我们能够提高机器拖拉机站的作用并改进其工作。去年机器拖拉机站所做的农业工作，折合成翻耕土地计算，比一九五三年多七千五百万公顷。
    最近一个时期采取了进一步加强集体农庄领导干部的一些措施。成千的党、苏维埃和经济工作人员以及集体农庄先进生产者被选为集体农庄的主席。他们当中有很多人已经从实践中证明，每一个集体农庄，即使是最落后的集体农庄也能够在短时期内变成先进和繁荣的集体农庄。
    农业商品产品生产的增加和一九五三年下半年所实行的提高国家对农产品征购和收购的价格，使集体农庄和集体农庄庄员的现金收入大大增加了。集体农庄和集体农庄庄员由于将自己的农产品缴售和出售给国家而得到的收入，在一九五三年比一九五二年多一百二十亿卢布，而一九五四年比一九五二年则多二百五十亿卢布。
    城市和工业中心在机器和干部方面给农业的大量帮助，以及城乡劳动人民为发展农业生产的共同努力，进一步加强了工人阶级领导的工人阶级与集体农民的联盟。
    在贯彻党关于发展农业的决议中，党组织与集体农民，与机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工人的联系加强了，群众政治工作和组织工作的水平提高了。这就使得农村中的社会主义竞赛能够更大规模地展开，培养了更多的耕种专家和畜牧业能手，其中许多人已经取得了卓越的成绩，在全苏农业展览会上展出了自己的成绩。
    过去一年的成就表明，这还只是我们为进一步发展农业所必须完成的巨大工作的开端。我们决不容许对这个初步成绩漠不关心或者因而骄傲自满，必须坚持不懈地实现党的发展农业的纲领。
    增加谷物生产——发展畜牧业的决定性条件
    同志们！苏共中央以前几次全体会议详细研究了有关增加谷物生产的问题。今天当我们讨论进一步发展畜牧业这个任务时，我们必须从这样一个事实出发，即发展谷物生产是发展一切农业部门，首先是畜牧业这个重要农业部门的决定性条件。
    党中央的二月—三月全会指出，目前的谷物生产水平，无论就其总产量或商品产量来说，都不能满足国民经济日益增长的需要。假如我们有足够的谷物，不仅能满足居民的需要而且能满足畜牧业的需要，那末我国就不会感到缺少畜产品了。
    也许有人会问，为什么在仅仅几年以前我们还认为有足够的谷物，而在今天却迫切地提出迅速增加谷物生产的问题呢？要回答这个问题，我们必须看一看战后我国所发生的变化和目前正在发生的变化。这里我想简短地谈一谈其中最重要的一些变化。
    第一，由于党和政府所采取的一些步骤，人民的福利已经大大增进了，而且还在不断地增进。在战后最初几年，物价还比较高，许多人不得不限制自己的消费。那时候我们好像有足够的谷物和其他产品来满足国家的需要。随着物价不断地减低，人民对食品和工业品的需要就大大增加了，而且年年增加。
    第二，由于我国出生率的增加和死亡率的降低，人口每年要增加三百多万。由于人口的增加，对于谷物和其他产品的需要也在不断增加。
    第三，我国城市和工业中心的人口每年都在增加。过去五年城市人口增加了将近一千七百万人。这主要是由于一部分农村人口移到城市里来了。五年来有九百多万人由农村来到城市。初看起来，这好像不会在消费方面引起多大的变动，因为这些人在农村也需要同样多的产品。事实上并不如此，因为这些来到城市的集体农民已不再是农业生产者，而是商品粮食的消费者了。
    第四，我们国家要有丰足的粮食储备，而且每年都要补充。国家没有适当的粮食储备是不行的，这是每一个人都懂得的道理，不必再来加以说明。
    第五，我们必须有足够的谷物进行对外贸易。
    第六，我们必须为畜牧业大大增加饲料生产；这是我们需要更多的谷物的主要原因。
    这些就是使得我国对谷物的需要大大增加的主要因素。这里更无须证明，这些因素大部分不仅不会随着时间的过去而消失，而且发生作用的范围反而会扩大。这就是说，我们必须尽最大的力量每年提高谷物生产，直到我们有了足够的谷物为止。
    一九五四年比一九五三年生产了更多的谷物。依靠开垦荒地和提高原有耕地的单位面积产量，一九五五年我们可以生产更多的谷物。这将足以满足居民的需要。但是集体农庄和国营农场目前的单位面积产量和各种作物播种面积的情况，是不能充分满足畜牧业对饲料的需要的。而正是这种需要，从前我们几乎没有考虑到。不用说，我们必须根本改变对待畜牧业饲料问题的态度。为了这个目的，我们必须在短时期内大大增加谷物的生产。
    据苏联国家计划委员会、农业部和中央统计局一部分工作人员估计，谷物总产量必须增加到一百亿普特才能做到不仅充分满足人民的粮食需要，而且保证满足畜牧业的饲料需要和国家必要的粮食储备。
    我们能不能在几年内完成这一任务呢？能够的。我们的社会主义经济具备完成这个任务的必要条件和巨大潜力。我们已经在小麦这种很宝贵的作物生产方面取得了很大的成就，不是吗？一九四○年小麦播种面积是四○、三○○、○○○公顷，一九五四年则增加到四九、三○○、○○○公顷，在这一时期，小麦在谷物产量中的比重从百分之三六点四增加到百分之四四。我国小麦产量已居世界第
  一位。无论在小麦总产量方面，或者按人口平均计算的小麦产量方面，我国都超过了美国。我们的单位面积产量还在不断提高，另外又在开垦生荒地和熟荒地，这就表示我们的小麦产量还可以继续增加。但是，在饲料作物方面，情况却远没有这样好。
    依靠哪些办法可以使我们在今后五六年内把谷物生产提高到我们所需要的水平呢？
    增加原有耕地的谷物产量（办法是减少收获时的损失，提高单位面积产量）；
    在生荒地和熟荒地上进一步扩大谷物播种面积；
    大量扩大玉蜀黍播种面积。
    赫鲁晓夫同志接着详细地论述了上述各种办法。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在谈到进一步增加原有耕地的谷物产量时指出，在这方面，首先必须改变收获中不可容许地大量损失谷物的情形。必须大量地生产收割联合机，更有效地使用收割联合机，必须使每一个农场至多在十个劳动日内完成收获工作。
    发展农业的斗争的首要任务将仍然是努力提高单位面积产量。必须坚持不渝地提高作物种植工作的水平，更及时地根据农业技术进行耕作，大规模地应用先进经验和科学成就。
    进一步增加谷物产量的最容易最快的办法是开垦生荒地和熟荒地。去年我们在开垦荒地方面做了大量工作，经验有力地证明了这一方针是正确的。西伯利亚西部各区谷物产量比一九五三年增加了一倍，哈萨克苏维埃社会主义共和国谷物产量增加百分之三十五。阿尔泰边疆区的谷物产量几乎增加了三倍。正是这些地区单位面积产量的增加和荒地的开垦弥补了我国因南部一些地区发生干旱而使谷物产量下降的情况。
    党中央委员会和部长会议决定，到一九五六年新开垦的土地上谷物播种面积至少要达到二千八百万公顷至三千万公顷。如果每公顷平均产量至少为一吨谷物，总共就将近有十八亿普特。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在进一步谈到扩大玉蜀黍播种面积的问题时，指出美国主要是用扩大玉蜀黍播种面积的办法增加了谷物总产量，在美国，玉蜀黍是产量最高的一种作物。一九五三年，美国玉蜀黍播种面积占全部谷物播种面积的百分之三十五，约三千万公顷，等于小麦的播种面积；玉蜀黍的产量共达四十五亿普特，占全部谷物产量的百分之五十五。美国的玉蜀黍几乎全部用作饲料。此外，还有三四百万公顷的玉蜀黍用作青储饲料。美国正是靠着玉蜀黍才得以使畜牧业高度发展的。
    一九五三年，苏联的玉蜀黍播种面积只有三百五十万公顷，占全部谷物播种面积的百分之三点三，玉蜀黍的收获量只有二亿三千万普特。
    赫鲁晓夫同志说，增产谷物的最好的办法就是扩大玉蜀黍的播种面积。如果我们从一九五三年的三百五十万公顷，到一九六○年至少增加到二千八百万公顷，就可以大大增加我国的谷物产量。我们有巨大的潜力来大量种植玉蜀黍，如果我们不利用扩大玉蜀黍播种面积这个好办法，那是说不过去的。
    玉蜀黍是一种宝贵的作物，因为它有两种好处：可以提供更多的谷物来源，它的茎可以做成很好的青储饲料。有这样大的面积播种玉蜀黍并及时而妥善地进行收获，既可以提供谷物，又可以把玉蜀黍的茎切小放在地窖储存起来作为多汁的饲料。分别收获下的玉蜀黍穗轴必须变成青储饲料，作为猪和其他牲畜以及家禽的谷物饲料；玉蜀黍茎必须单独储存起来，当作奶牛和其他牲畜的多汁饲料。
    赫鲁晓夫同志接着说，几年来，特别是去年，我们在国内不同地区试行种植玉蜀黍，结果，凡是耕作仔细的地方，即使在北部地区，也获得了丰收。
    我们在中部和北部地区大规模扩大玉蜀黍的种植的第一年就获得了良好的收成，不仅是个别集体农庄收成好，而且整区整州收成都好。必须更大规模地在国内各个不同地区扩大玉蜀黍的种植。
    赫鲁晓夫同志接着说，同志们，谷物总产量如果达到一百亿普特，就能够充分满足国家的全部粮食需要，建立更加充足的粮食储备，同时还可以拿四十多亿普特谷物以及大量的麦麸、豆饼和各种配合饲料供应畜牧业。由于耕作水平提高，畜牧业极需要的其他作物如马铃薯、饲料用胡萝卜、饲料用甜菜、普通甜菜等的总产量也将增加，牧草的单位面积产量也将增加。这样，畜牧业就可以获得为本身发展所需要的巩固的饲料基地；畜牧业的产品生产率和收益将会提高。
    赫鲁晓夫同志指出，迅速提高谷物产量的任务，对于实现共产主义建设的伟大计划有特别的重要性。提高谷物产量的斗争就是加强我们祖国的经济力量、进一步提高人民福利的斗争。
    党在提出大大增加谷物总产量的任务时所依据的是发展重工业方面所取得的成就、社会主义大规模农业生产的优越性和先进农业工作者的丰富经验。这些先进农业工作者使用科学方法，已经指出了丰收的道路。
    如果我们团结集体农民、工人阶级和全体人民共同努力提高谷物产量，那末，在今后五六年内获得年产量一百亿普特谷物的收成这一有全国性意义的任务一定能胜利完成！这是毫无疑问的。
    增加肉类、奶类、蛋类、羊毛和其他畜产品的主要任务
    同志们，在苏共中央九月全会以后，各地党组织和苏维埃机关、集体农民、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工人努力执行了党所制定的发展畜牧业的措施。这项工作，正如我在报告开头时所说的，是在很困难的情况下进行的。许多地区所发生的干旱和边远地区的牧场冬季严寒给畜牧业造成了很大的困难，使它遭到很大的损失。尽管这样，从一九五三年十月一日到一九五四年十月一日这段时期，牛的总头数还是增加了一百九十万（其中奶牛增加一百五十万头），猪增加三百四十万头，羊增加二百六十万头。牲畜的产品生产率也增加了一些。
    在研究畜牧业的状况时，我们应当特别注意公有畜牧业在供给劳动人民以食品、供给工业以原料方面的意义和作用。公有畜牧业是基础；依靠了它，我们就可以充分满足全国对畜产品的需要。因此，党在过去和将来都是首先注意发展集体农庄和国营农场的畜牧业。
    在战后年代里，我们在发展公有畜牧业方面取得了一定的成就。去年国家从集体农庄、国营农场和其他国营企业征购的畜产品，在国家征购的全部畜产品中所占的比重如下：肉类约百分之七十八，奶类百分之七十七，蛋类百分之五十四，羊毛百分之九十二。
    这些数字证明，集体农庄和国营农场为市场提供了许多货物，就供应国家以畜产品来说，它们起了主要作用。这就是集体农庄和国营农场在生产上的巨大胜利。不过，集体农庄和国营农场仍然没有充分利用现有的条件来增加畜产品的产量。
    在发展社会主义畜牧业当中，我们决不应当过低估计集体农民、工人和职员私人所有的畜牧业，这种畜牧业是按照农业劳动组合的章程进行的，是仅供私人消费之用的。党和政府一直是将来也是鼓励集体农民、工人和职员饲养牲畜的，因为这可以增进人民的福利。但是，重心应当放在发展公有畜牧业上，因为公有畜牧业必须在使国家获得丰富的农产品和消费品方面起决定性的作用。
    我已经举出一些数字说明我国牲畜的头数已经增加，因而肉类、奶类、牛油和蛋类的征购量已增加了。虽然如此，畜产品还是不够的。这是什么原因呢？首先是因为消费量大大增加了。经过多次减低物价以后，畜产品的需要增加了许多。一九五四年出售给居民的肉类增加为一九四○年的二点八倍，牛油二点六倍，蛋类一点四倍，毛织品约三倍。畜产品的需要量还会增加。我们必须用一切办法来满足这一需要，因为对共产党和苏联政府说来，没有比关心人民的福利更重要的事情了。
    从畜产品的需要量增加这点来看，畜产品的生产水平显然是不够高的。因此，必须大量增加肉类、奶类、牛油、蛋类、羊毛和其他产品的产量。
    在决定集体农庄和国营农场出产畜产品的能力时，我们必须从它们所拥有的土地的数量和质量出发，要考虑到畜牧业的发展直接决定于现有的土地和正确地使用土地。因此，在计划牛油和奶类的产量时，应当以一百公顷的耕地、草地和牧场为单位；计算猪肉的产量时，应当以一百公顷耕地为单位；计算家禽的产量时，应当以一百公顷种植谷物的土地为单位。
    制订公有畜牧业发展计划时必须依据这个原则。为了按照科学标准保证全国居民的食品供应，全国每年每一百公顷耕地、草地和牧场必须平均出产二点七吨肉类和二十六吨奶类，每一百公顷耕地至少必须出产三吨猪肉，每一百公顷种植谷物的土地至少必须出产七万四千枚蛋类。还应当指出，这种计算所依据的科学标准不应当看成是一成不变的。毫无疑问，实际生活会修正这个标准，并使它更加精确。
    现在，我们还严重地落后于为满足全国的需要所应有的水平。但是，这种落后可以在短期内克
  服。
    为此，我们首先要求大大提高牲畜的产品生产率并增加牲畜的数量。
    交给中央委员会全体会议审查的决议草案中，提出了一项重要的全国性的经济任务：到一九六○年全国主要畜产品的产量要比一九五四年增加如下：
    肉类和各种油脂——百分之一百
    奶类——百分之一百
    蛋类——百分之一百二十
    各种羊毛——百分之八十
    为了保证畜牧业按照这个计划迅速发展，全党和全国就必须重视这一经济部门。
    应当指出，有些党组织还没有认识到我国畜牧业的落后程度，它们执行中央委员会九月会议的决议的情况还不能令人满意。尽管中央委员会提出了严重警告，去年若干共和国、边疆区和州非但没有增加牲畜的头数和提高产品生产率，实际上反而使牲畜头数减少，产品生产率降低了。这一事实若说不是由于上面提出的原因，又怎么解释呢？
    畜产品产量落后的原因之一是在制定畜牧业计划方面有很大的缺点。农业部和国营农场部的领导人员实际上是根据这样一个不正确的假定来制订计划的，他们以为增加牲畜头数就可以解决畜牧业的问题。
    这就不能不产生这种现象，实际上某些地区已经产生了这种现象：虽然增加牲畜头数的任务都完成了，可是畜产品的产量却年年减少。
    赫鲁晓夫同志说，畜牧业并不是一个动物园，可以让一个优秀的管理人饲养各种各样的动物。任何一种牲畜都不能是为饲养而饲养，而是为了得到畜产品。编制计划时决不能忽略主要目的是要在国家规定的期间内获得必需数量的畜产品。用最少数量的牲畜取得规定数量的奶类、肉类和牛油，就是为国家和人民造福。
    到会的各位知道，从今年开始，我们必须用一种新的办法来编制关于播种面积和发展畜牧业的计划。这是发展农业生产各部门的一项极重要的措施。
    过去编制计划的方式是自上而下的，没有适当考虑到各地土壤和气候等条件，而由上级发给每一地区一个种植谷物的计划，一个按照牲畜品种发展畜牧业的计划。这种方式并不能帮助机器拖拉机站工作人员、农业专家、集体农庄领导人和集体农民群众发挥主动性和创造性，而是造成了形式主义地执行上级指示的现象。
    制订计划的新方法意味着集体农庄和国营农场将以生产一定数量的商品产品为出发点。同时要计算的不应当是某种农作物的耕种面积或牲畜的头数，而是每公顷土地收获了多少公担的谷物、马铃薯以及其他蔬菜和农作物，畜牧部门得到了多少肉类、奶类和其他畜产品。这样就会使农业工作者更加注意提高农作物单位面积产量和公有畜牧业的产品生产率。
    苏共中央全会的决议草案规定要迅速增加畜产品产量。有人也许要问：这个任务是否切合实际？对这个问题只有一种答案：是的，完全切合实际，而且我们具备胜利地完成这个任务的一切必要条件。只要正确地利用和发掘现有潜力就行了。
    同志们，想想吧，我国的潜力真是无限的。在极端不同的地区，先进的集体农庄和国营农场一九五四年平均每头奶牛的产奶量要比全国的指数高出两倍，每一百公顷的耕地上所得到的猪肉要比全国的指数高出三倍到四倍，每只羊的羊毛产量要比全部集体农庄和国营农场的羊毛平均产量多一倍到两倍。
    大多数集体农庄和国营农场能不能达到先进农场的水平而取得先进农场同样的成就呢？如果我们正确地发展畜牧业，它们是一定能够达到的。
    赫鲁晓夫同志进一步谈了许多关于增加猪肉、牛肉和其他肉类、蛋类、家禽、奶类和羊毛等产量的具体问题。
    赫鲁晓夫同志指出，苏联各加盟共和国的共产党中央委员会和部长会议、各边疆区党委员会和州党委员会、边疆区和州苏维埃执行委员会将拟出一九五五年到一九六○年各该加盟共和国、边疆区和州迅速发展畜牧业的措施，并在一九五五年五月一日以前提交苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议审查。这种工作必须从基层开始。每个集体农庄和国营农场要在广大庄员群众、国营农场和机器拖拉机站的工人和专家的参加下，全面而深入地研究当地的条件，总结现有经验并作出提高每一百公顷土地上的畜产品产量的具体措施。
    各区、州、边疆区和共和国的计划必须根据各集体农庄和国营农场的措施来编制。这样来对待这个任务，就会提高广大农业劳动群众的积极性，更大地发挥他们的首创精神，发掘和利用当地的用之不竭的资源和潜力。领导这项巨大的国民经济工作，是各地党组织的光荣任务。
    扩大饲料生产
    同志们，为了增加畜产品产量，必须大力建立巩固的饲料基地。应当承认，许多年来饲料方面的情况是非常不能令人满意的。去年的情况也没有根本改变。的确，集体农庄和国营农场在去年已经扩大了一年生牧草、青储饲料用玉蜀黍和其他某些农作物的种植面积，而且比一九五三年多生产了五百五十万吨青储饲料。但是如果从去年牲畜的头数已经增加这一点来考虑，那末每头牲畜实际的饲料供应并没有改善，而且在若干地区反而更坏了。
    畜牧业的饲料基地问题并不是现在第一次提出来。那末为什么我们没有得到预期的效果呢？这是由于我们还没有能使许多地方上的领导工作者的思想改变过来，他们错误地认为不用各种各样质地优良的饲料好好地饲养牲畜，畜产品产量也可以增加。糟糕的是许多领导工作者只是发表关于饲料的演说，拟订关于饲料的决议，并不在集体农庄和国营农场里组织群众坚持不懈地努力增加饲料的产量。
    我们已经谈过增加谷物产量对发展公有畜牧业的巨大重要性。要按照计划增加牲畜头数和提高产品生产率，不仅必须大大增加谷物产量，而且必须大大增加青储饲料、块根饲料、马铃薯和其他饲料。
    到一九六○年各集体农庄和国营农场的饲料产量最低限度必须达到下列水平：
    精饲料——增加到六千五百万吨，即增加为一九五三年的一千二百万吨的五倍以上。
    青储饲料——增加到一亿七千六百万吨，即增加为一九五三年的三千二百万吨的五倍半。
    块根饲料和瓜类饲料——增加到三千八百万吨，即增加为一九五三年的九百万吨的四倍以上。
    马铃薯——增加到二千五百万吨，即增加为一九五三年的五百万吨的五倍。
    粗饲料——增加到一亿七千八百万吨，即增加为一九五三年的一亿二千九百万吨的将近一倍半以上。
    主要的是使各集体农庄和国营农场的饲料作物播种面积能保证各种牲畜得到充分数量和种类的饲料。如果能把工作正确地组织起来，那末在任何地区，不要到一九六○年，而在今后两三年内就可以完成这个任务了。在潮湿地区，甚至在一年内就可以取得巨大的成就。
    在这方面，我想再一次请大家注意在发展畜牧业方面具有无限潜力的玉蜀黍，玉蜀黍在提高畜产品生产率方面的潜力几乎是无可比拟的。
    然而还是有许多工作人员只谈玉蜀黍的好处，而不在集体农庄和国营农场里为提高玉蜀黍的收成进行真正的组织工作……
    如果每个集体农庄和国营农场都普遍地种植玉蜀黍，那末在短时期内就可以建立一个良好的饲料基地，增加畜产品的生产率。
    当然，这并不是说玉蜀黍应该代替其他一切农作物。不是的，没有各种各样的饲料，畜牧业就不能发展。因此我们必须迅速增加马铃薯、饲料用甜菜，饲料用卷心菜、苏丹草、苜蓿、金花菜、野豌豆和燕麦的配合饲料以及其他许多饲料作物的生产量。但同时必须特别注意玉蜀黍的生产，因为它的产量特别高，可以解决以多汁的以及在很大程度上可以精制的谷物饲料和青储的、未熟的玉蜀黍穗轴充分地饲养牲畜的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫同志强调说，集体农庄必须自己来决定选择饲料作物的问题，这种作物在具体情况下要能在单位面积上生产出最多数量的宝贵饲料。
    我国所有的河流地区都有成百万公顷的草地。这些优良的天然饲料生长区必须充分利用。
    许多集体农庄的草地被忽略了，草的产量很低。我们必须开始在这些草地和天然草地上认真工作，在短期内把它们变成产量很高的饲料产地，并用机器来收割。
    我想谈一谈不善于利用天然草地以致大片草地上的牧草年年没有人收割的问题。怎么会这样呢？因为需要收割这些牧草的时候，集体农庄往往缺乏劳动力，特别是那些用人力来割草的集体农庄。
    我们必须好好想一想这个问题。集体农庄的牲畜显然应该在那些不适于用机器来收割的草地上放青，特别是那些缺少人力、采取畜舍饲养法并播种饲草来弥补干草饲料不足（如野豌豆和燕麦配合饲料、苜蓿等）的集体农庄。
    赫鲁晓夫同志说，必须在最短时期内恢复草的种子、块根饲料作物和其他饲料作物的商品生产，以便集体农庄有充足的这类种籽来满足自己的需要和出售。
    特种配合饲料对于增加畜产品特别是奶类、猪肉和蛋类的产量，是很重要的。另一个供应畜牧业饲料的源泉是食品工业中的废料，如残渣、废谷、酒糟等等。食品工业每年出产二千五百万吨残渣和废谷。如果合理地利用这些废料来饲养牲畜，至少可以得到三十万吨肉类。
    我们还应该想一想出口豆饼，麦麸和其他精制饲料是否恰当的问题。
    在解决公有牲畜的饲料供应问题时，我们还必须做到使集体农庄有足够的饲料分配给有私人牲畜的集体农民，作为劳动日的报酬。这将有助于提高集体农民建立集体农庄饲料基地和加强劳动纪律的兴趣。
    迅速增加饲料的生产是一件具有全国意义的事。一切党机关和苏维埃机关、一切农业机关、集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场必须经常而具体地研究为公有畜牧业建立巩固的饲料基地的问题。
    畜牧业中的建筑工程和劳动机械化问题
    集体农庄和国营农场如果没有储藏和制造饲料所需要的建筑物，就不能胜利解决建立巩固的饲料基地的任务。所以，我们必须普遍建筑饲料储藏室、饲料储藏窖以及用机器制造各种饲料的饲料制造工场。
    要发展产品率高的公有畜牧业，就必须迅速地大大改进牲畜饲养工作。因此，为了在今后几年增加牲畜的头数，必须把现有的畜舍加以整修，并且大规模地建筑新的畜舍。
    建筑饲料储藏室和饲料储藏窖的工作情况怎样呢？很坏。只提出一点来就够了：六年来集体农庄建造的储藏饲料用建筑物的总容量只有一千万吨，有许多州和区根本没有建造。这样的情况是绝对不能容忍的。
    在今后六年内，集体农庄必须建造总容量不少于四千五百万吨的永久性储藏饲料用建筑物。集体农庄和机器拖拉机站必须集中力量来解决这个迫切任务。地方工业和伐木工业各企业必须开始大规模生产储藏饲料用的预装配建筑物来卖给集体农庄。
    在建造畜舍方面也有重大缺点。集体农庄的牲畜只有一小部分住到建筑良好和设备完善的畜舍。
    当前的任务是按照计划中的公有牲畜头数的增加速度完成大量的畜舍建造工程。建造畜舍和集体农庄其他建筑物具有重大的意义。
    由于党和政府采取了发展农业的措施，集体农庄和集体农庄庄员的收入大大增加。许多集体农庄的收入在一年内就增加了好几倍。现在，集体农庄能够比过去多拿出一些资金来扩大生产，特别是建造畜舍。集体农庄的投资首先要用来发展经济，使集体农庄的收入更高。但是，在资金许可的条件下，也应当建造俱乐部和住宅。有人认为建造俱乐部是一种浪费，但是一个集体农庄不进行群众工作是不会巩固的。现在集体农庄扩大了，需要有俱乐部。幼儿园、托儿所、接生站也应当建立。我们还应当帮助集体农庄庄员建造私人住宅。这些农村建设问题是迫切的，必须加以解决。
    赫鲁晓夫同志接着指出，集体农庄必须更好地利用自己的一切力量和资金来胜利解决农村建设的巨大任务。国家不能够分出人力和建筑机构来为集体农庄进行建设。集体农庄必须自己有建筑工程队。如果每一个集体农庄能够更合理地组织劳动，在农闲时广泛吸引庄员参加建设工作，这样来正确地利用劳动潜力，那末农村建设的工作是可以胜利开展的。在大规模进行建筑的地方，各集体农庄最好按合股原则成立联合建筑工程公司，生产砖、混凝土块和瓦之类材料，建造各集体农庄共用的水力发电站和其他大建筑物……。
    各共和国、边疆区和州的党机关和苏维埃机关必须深入研究靠地方资源发展建筑事业的可能性。城市和乡村建设部必须在短时期内供给集体农庄以好的标准设计图案，帮助它们生产建筑材料，预装配结构和部件。
    机器拖拉机站也必须更加努力帮助集体农庄进行建设。如果每一个机器拖拉机站都积极帮助集体农庄，那末畜舍的建筑工程就会大大加快。
    近几年来，集体农庄为畜牧业中费力劳动的机械化做了一定的工作。但是，这一部门的机械化水平至今还是十分不够，这是公有畜牧业长期落后的根本原因之一。造成这种情况的原因是我们的农业部以及汽车、拖拉机和农业机器制造部门在这方面采取了不正确的态度，多年来一直没有解决畜牧业机械化这一重要问题。由于这些部的工作拖拉，至今我们还没有能使畜牧业各部门的主要劳动过程全盘机械化。
    赫鲁晓夫同志严厉批评了若干部的工作，指出我们的若干部、若干工作部门和机器拖拉机站不应当只在口头上，而应当在实际上从事畜牧业的机械化工作。赫鲁晓夫同志说，在为畜牧业费力工作机械化而增加现代化机器的生产同时，必须特别注意饲料生产的全盘机械化、饲料储藏工作的机械化、供水和饲料制作工作的机械化、饲养场费力工作的电气化。
    只有根本改进机器拖拉机站的工作，才能实现畜牧业的全盘机械化。党机关和苏维埃机关的任务就是要使机器拖拉机站在不久的将来成为畜牧业中的决定性力量，就像它现在在谷物生产中一样。
    农业生产的广泛机械化可以减轻农业工作人员的劳动，提高农业劳动生产率，降低农产品的成本，同时还可以使集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场更好地组织人力（现在有相当大一部分人在从事生产率很低的手工劳动）。在广泛机械化的条件下，生产单位产品所需的劳动和费用将会减少，劳动报酬会提高，因此，农村劳动者的物质生活就会得到改善。
    增加国营农场的畜产品产量
    大家知道，国营农场在我国农业中占着重要的地位。它们是按照伟大的列宁的理想建立起来的，是农业中国有企业的典范。
    许多国营农场事实上是先进的社会主义企业，他们在发展农业方面起着巨大的作用，可以说，有不少国营农场已经超过我们国家所要求的每一百公顷土地上农产品的生产水平。
    在最近开垦生荒地和熟荒地的巨大工作开始进行的时期，国营农场再一次表现了它的生命力和巨大的经济潜力。去年春天，在我国东部地区建立了
  一百二十四个大型国营谷物农场。苏联爱国者响应党的号召到达开荒地区，在阿尔泰和西伯利亚其他地区、哈萨克斯坦和乌拉尔的一望无际的草原上建立了巨大的谷物农场，开垦了几百万公顷的生荒地和熟荒地，为国家生产了大量的粮食。现在，还要建立二百八十个到三百个国营农场。第一年开垦生荒地和熟荒地的经验表明，国营农场在增加谷物生产方面有着远大的前途。先进国营农场发展畜牧业的经验证明，国营农场在增加国家的畜产品生产方面可以并且必须起重要的作用。
    国营农场拥有广大的耕地，有先进的技术装备，有熟练的工人。问题只在于正确利用这一切条件来为国家大力发展国营农场的生产。但是目前许多国营农场的工作水平还不能满足日益增长的要求。
    赫鲁晓夫同志严厉批评了国营农场和国营农场部工作中的缺点以后说：
    国营农场面前摆着增加畜产品生产的责任重大的任务。今后五六年内，苏联国营农场部各国营农场必须把肉类产量增为一九五四年的一点八倍，乳类——二点八倍，羊毛——二点二倍，蛋类——四倍。
    国营农场还必须做到在每一百公顷耕地上比集体农庄出产多得多的畜产品。国营农场的牲畜产品生产率必须提高到平均每头乳牛产奶三千一百公斤，每头羊出产羊毛四点二公斤，食用牲畜的平均产肉量是：牛每头三百二十五公斤，猪——一百一十二公斤，羊——四十四公斤。食品工业部所属各国营农场的平均挤奶量必须提高到三千七百公斤，去年是三千零三十六公斤。
    为了保证按计划增加牲畜头数和提高畜产品生产率，国营农场必须在一九六○年使饲料缴售量增加如下：粗饲料比一九五三年增加一倍，多汁饲料增加三倍，马铃薯增加将近九倍，自种谷物饲料增加二点四倍。国营农场主要依靠提高单位面积产量和改进各种作物的播种面积的比例，就可以把饲料的产量增加到这个目标。
    提高国营农场在增加谷物和畜产品生产方面的作用这个当前任务，要求国营农场部以及地方党机关和苏维埃机关大大改进领导国营农场的工作。国营农场部必须抛弃文牍主义和官僚主义的领导方法，必须更深入地研究国营农场的情况，使每一个国营农场都成为合乎标准的和赢利的企业。如果经营正确，就不可能有企业亏本的事，而国营农场尤其如此。亏本的国营农场是没有存在的权利的。
    在向国营农场部的领导提出要求的同时，也必须要求地方党组织提高对国营农场工作的责任心。必须承认，各加盟共和国共产党中央委员会、各边疆区委和各州委一直到最近还很少关心国营农场的工作，还认为这只是国营农场部的事。这是不对的。国营农场是国有企业，因此不仅是国营农场部要对它们的工作负责，地方党组织也要对它们的工作负责。
    关于征购农产品
    同志们，在制定进一步增加肉类、奶类、蛋类和羊毛的产量的办法时，我们还必须采取一些措施来改进征购农产品特别是畜产品的组织工作，改进把这些产品供应给居民的组织工作。
    征购制的目的是储备各种农产品，储备满足居民需要的粮食和满足工业需要的原料。
    根据多年的经验，各共和国、各州和各区都自行规定了各种产品的交售定额。所有征购的产品都是国家统一掌握的。粮食先由某一部或某一部门储备起来，然后通过商业系统来满足劳动人民的需要。在社会主义制度下，由于实行计划经济，国家可以积极影响产品的生产和分配，可以按照发展经济和增进人民福利的原则来调节粮食和原料的来源。
    但是，问题是统一供应工作中存在着对生产和分配产品有害的严重缺点，那就是供应工作同各该共和国或州的生产和征购情况脱了节。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫指出这种作法是不正确的，他强调说，目前的分配原则并没有使地方上的负责干部去注意保证提高生产和最大限度地利用现有潜力的问题，而是使他们去注意重新分配全国产品的问题去了。
    经济福利是以物质生产为基础的。必须先创造价值然后才能进行分配。目前的供应制度在某种程度上使我们某些干部不去注意主要的一面，也就是说不去注意农业增产问题。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫接着说，目前的供应工作不仅减低了地方负责干部在农产品生产方面的责任，而且减低了他们在满足当地居民对这些产品的需要方面的责任。如果一个区、一个州或者一个共和国缺少某种产品，地方负责干部就可以把过错向中央机关一推。任何一个工作干部，即使是一个失职的干部，也可以好像问心无愧似地说：“我们没有办法，分配给我们的东西太不够了。”
    在分配农产品的问题上，不去考虑某一个共和国或某一个州在当地利用潜力来生产这些产品的情况，也不去考虑它如何履行对国家的义务，像这种平均主义的做法该怎样来纠正呢？必须在增加产品产量和改进对居民的供应工作方面发挥地方机关的主动性和提高它们的责任心。我想为了达到这一目的就必须采取下列一些措施：保持集中原则，同时在决定分配给某一州的产品数量时要看它如何利用本地的潜力，看它在增加产品产量也就是在增加国家产品储备方面做了多少工作。这种分配原则是完全符合社会主义原则的，是完全符合按劳取酬的原则的。
    在集体农庄发展初期，收入是按照人口的数目来分配的。事实证明这种方法是不适当的。集体农庄摒弃了这种方法而采取了按劳动分配收入的办法。我想，如果我们的供应制度以生产原则为基础，也就是说，如果我们考虑到全国每个州在尽量利用潜力来发展当地生产方面所作的努力，那末，事情就会是正确的。
    国家通过征购办法收到的产品，必须按照国民经济发展的需要和进一步增进劳动人民的福利这一原则来进行分配。
    在集中到国家仓库的产品中，必须拨出一部分来满足不能从附近地区得到产品来满足自己的需要的大城市和工业中心，还必须用来满足军队、对外贸易和国家储存的需要。
    至于集中在国家仓库的产品的其余部分，必须按照对于产品的实际需要和利用现有的生产潜力的程度来分配给全国其他城市和其他地区。
    因此，必须估计到各共和国、各边疆区和各州为国家仓库和满足本地居民需要提供农产品的各种可能性。其次，必须估计到区、州或共和国对于各种产品的需要，必须决定从什么地方收集这些产品来满足这些需要。例如，如果一个主要是生产棉花或其他技术作物的加盟共和国或州，虽然它完成了各种农产品的生产任务和征购任务，但是不能充分把农产品供应居民，那末国家就应该从集中储备的产品中拨出它所缺少的产品。
    必须采取一些措施来鼓励那些超额完成计划定额和努力发掘增加产品储备的潜力的共和国、州和区。这种鼓励的方式之一就是，按照当地的条件、人口的多寡和工业的发展水平把地方机关征购到的超过国家定额的产品拨出百分之五十或七十留给地方机关。在这方面必须遵守严格的规定：如果一个区征购的产品数量超过计划，就必须按照一定的比例留给它产品。
    集中储备的某些产品现在还不能完全满足居民的需要。这说明我们还必须竭力增加用以充实这种储备的产品数量。在分配粮食的时候，国家集中制必须和加盟共和国的独立的主动性结合起来，同时在这方面还必须给予边疆区和州一定的（姑且这么说）自主权利。一方面，每一个区都可以根据现有的可能性和生产水平从集中入库的产品中分到一定数量的产品。另一方面，每一个区都具有各种可能性来增加产品的产量，改进对当地居民的供应工作，并在这方面广泛地发挥主动性。如果一个区没有充分地利用自己的可能性，因而产量比按照这些可能性定出的数量少，这就要由地方领导机关负责。如果产品缺少，就说明地方负责干部的工作做得很差，没有尽力发掘潜力来更充分地满足居民对肉类、牛油、奶类、马铃薯和其他蔬菜、水果以及其他本地产品的需要。在这种情况下，地方负责干部不能借口中央机关没有拨给他们产品而推卸责任。
    如果这一原则付诸实施，毫无疑问，它就会帮助我们在保持集中制的情况下发挥地方的主动性，为居民积累大批粮食，为工业积累大批原料。
    为改进农产品的供应工作而决定一些措施并不意味着要改变以按公顷计算的原则为基础的征购制度。必须坚决地实行这一原则，因为它正确地反映了国家和集体农庄庄员之间的经济关系，并正确地把人民的利益和集体农庄的利益结合起来。
    按公顷计算的原则规定集体农庄对国家的义务一律平等，同时也考虑到气候、土壤以及某些农业地区的经济条件。肉类、奶类、羊毛和其他畜产品以及原料按公顷规定义务交售定额是正确的，必须严格执行。不但在规定农产品的义务交售数字时应当遵守这一原则，在决定国家收购数字时也同样应当遵守这一原则；现在，当收购畜产品在整个国家征购计划中所占的比重已经大大增加的时候，遵守这一原则尤其重要。
    在进行畜产品的征购和收购工作的时候，必须使每一个集体农庄都乐于大大地增加商品产品。我们必须使收购计划符合各该集体农庄的条件，不要在计划中对先进集体农庄提出太高的要求，不要使这些集体农庄处于不利的地位。必须提供一些条件使集体农庄能够顺利地完成交售和出售畜产品的计划，并在集体农庄市场上出售自己的一部分产品。
    党、苏维埃和征购机关的任务就是在严格遵守按公顷计算的原则的情况下，保证无条件地完成义务交售、实物支付和收购畜产品的计划。今年国家要完成的收购计划对于征购组织和集体农庄说来是一件新的、与过去不同的任务。为了顺利地完成这一任务，必须彻底改进在这一重大任务方面的领导。
    接着赫鲁晓夫同志详细地谈到了关于改进农产品的征购制度的问题。
    农业领导和农村中党的政治工作
    同志们，现在当我们具备了物质条件和组织条件来不断增加农业生产的时候，一切，或者差不多一切，就都有赖于党、苏维埃和农业机关在农业方面的领导水平，有赖于我们干部的主动性和效率，有赖于他们执行党和政府的决议的能力了。
    弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁曾经不止一次地指出，领导经济建设方面的公式主义、形式主义和无人负责现象是不能容忍的，必须直接领导创造出社会物质财富的生产。
    党中央委员会根据列宁的指示，最近采取了若干措施来改进在农业方面的领导工作。农村区党委员会为了加强在生产方面的影响，已将工作加以调整；区委会已经建立了指导员小组，每一小组须负责好几个机器拖拉机站。各共和国和州的机关已经派遣工作人员去加强区委会和区苏维埃执行委员会。作为社会主义国家领导集体农庄的重要基地的机器拖拉机站的作用也加强了。去年的经验生动地证明了这些措施的正确性。
    最近一段时期，集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场方面的领导工作已经有了一些改进。党和苏维埃机关的工作人员已经开始更细致地处理农业方面的问题，更加深入集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的实际工作了。
    赫鲁晓夫同志接着就管理农业工作的各个部的机构问题提出了一些意见。
    按照党中央委员会前几次会议的指示，管理农业工作的各个部的机构已经有了一些调整，表报制度也简化了；在农业机关工作的许多专家已经调到机器拖拉机站、集体农庄和国营农场。
    但是这些部的机构仍然过于庞大，里面还存在着许多官僚主义现象。许多专家在农业机关里把时间浪费在文牍工作上，他们没有进行实际工作，却把时间用在草拟命令、各种各样的指示和汇集材料上。这样农业机关就制造了大量文牍工作，使许多下层工作人员脱离实际工作而忙于阅读各种通告和草拟复文。
    中央机关和地方的联系仍然很不够，对全国各地区的特点和潜力仍然估计不足，先进经验的宣传和推广工作进行得很迟缓。
    由于这些部的机构目前是这样一种情况，在领导发展农业各部门和耕种主要作物方面存在着没有人负责的现象，领导工作已经分散到形形色色的委员会和部门中去了。结果，对于一些主要的作物甚至对于个别农业部门都没有充分地加以研究，而这些部及其地方机关往往忽略了在发展这些部门方面所存在的最重要的问题。
    从马铃薯和其他蔬菜种植的例子可以看出农业部的机构是多么落后于现实。赫鲁晓夫同志在谈到这一点时着重指出，必须安排好这个部的建制。他说，最重要的是要由一些拥有广泛权力并能对委派给自己的任务完全负责的高级干部在部里处理发展农业基本部门的问题。他们必须成为执行党和政府关于按照全国不同地区发展某些农业部门的指示的组织者；他们必须设法提高某一种作物的产量，使商品农产品的数量增加。
    必须加强专业检查员在农业机关的作用。为了完成这些工作，我们必须邀请那些热爱自己的业务、干练、精力充沛和具有毅力的专家同志，使他们能实际投入组织工作而不陷入文牍工作。他们的主要工作是检查、监督和组织集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作，总结并有系统地介绍先进经验和科学成就。
    各州农业委员会必须拥有一批专家负责它们所管辖的机器拖拉机站的工作。在机器拖拉机站工作的专家们必须对某一地区普遍种植的某些农作物具有丰富的知识。集体农庄也必须实行个人负责制，必须有负责发展农业和畜牧业的组织者；这样的组织者也许可以从集体农庄管理委员会中挑选出来。
    如果管理农业工作的各个部的各个机构和它们的地方机关能这样来进行工作，那末就可以在运用丰富的知识并考虑到各经济地区的特殊情况下更加有效地领导发展主要农业部门的工作。
    改造这些部的各个机构和它们的地方机关的各项工作不是一个短时间的运动，而必须经常地、坚持不渝地进行斗争。
    赫鲁晓夫同志然后谈到了关于地方机关的主动性和提高它们在发展农业中的责任的问题。他说，为了改进农业的领导工作，提高地方机关的责任感和发挥它们的主动性已越来越具有特殊重要性。
    所谓正确地领导农业，就是说首先应当预见到农业的发展前途，及时地发现问题，积极地促进新鲜事物和先进事物的发展，坚决地向一切陈腐和过时的事物，向一切阻碍我们前进的事物作斗争，而我们的某些领导工作人员，有时候恰恰就不是采取这样的态度来处理问题。
    赫鲁晓夫同志引证了塔吉克斯坦和乌兹别克斯坦发展棉花种植业的情况来加以说明，他指出，一方面，地方机关及时地、主动地根据先进方法来改进农业管理工作，会给国家带来多少好处；而另一方面，那些成为陈腐思想的俘虏、看不见新鲜事物并且阻碍新事物发展的领导工作人员会给工作带来多么大的损失。他在这一点上还补充说，我们必须全力支持那些了解自己的工作、热爱自己的工作并且有助于加强祖国威力的人。
    我们对于领导工作人员必须要求得严格一些，必须培养他们对党和人民的责任感，必须纠正对新鲜事物丧失感觉的人的看法并予以批评，如果这种办法无效，就降他们的级。
    赫鲁晓夫同志接着从几方面谈到了加强俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国边疆区和州的经济文化建设的领导问题。他强调指出了俄罗斯联邦在执行党提出的农业方面的任务时所起的巨大作用，同时，他也指出了俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国的许多州和边疆区在农业领导工作中的严重缺点。
    赫鲁晓夫同志说，最近党中央委员会采取了若干措施来改进俄罗斯联邦的边疆区和州的领导工作。俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国部长会议的作用和责任都加强了，农业部和国营农场部也加强了。党中央委员会现在已经成立了俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国党机关部和俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国农业部。这就使党中央委员会可以与俄罗斯联邦的边疆区和州取得更加密切的联系，更好地了解这些地方的干部并进行检查。我们必须继续朝这一方向努力。
    所有共和国的各部和各部门也必须提高责任感。它们必须更加细致地处理共和国今后发展的问题，必须迅速地答复地方机关提出的问题，并毫不迟延地解决临时发生的问题。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在报告的最后一部分谈到必须动员群众努力发展畜牧业。
    他说，同志们，要胜利实现发展畜牧业的伟大计划，党和苏维埃人民就必须作很大的努力。我们必须克服严重的困难，我们是不会被这些困难吓倒的。
    弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁曾经说过，国家是从群众的觉悟中吸取力量的。只有当群众了解了每件事情、能够判断每件事情并能自觉地做每件事情的时候，国家才是强大的。我国的共产主义建设为列宁这一英明的教言提供了无数的例证。开垦生熟荒地的巨大群众运动就是人民群众发挥高度积极性的辉煌例证之一。
    党组织在争取进一步发展农业的斗争中，已经在某种程度上改进了自己的群众工作。但是，党的政治工作无论在组织方面，在内容和形式方面，都还存在着重大缺点。群众政治教育工作应当是生动而具有创造性的，却往往流于老一套和一般性的讨论。许多党和苏维埃机关的工作者很少去访问集体农庄工作队、饲畜场和较远的牧场，很少同集体农民和国营农场工作人员讨论事情。日常的群众政治工作通常总是全盘交给普通的鼓动员去做，而这些鼓动员在进行工作的时候又往往是时冷时热的。
    党组织必须密切注意政治鼓动工作的内容。我想谈谈这方面的两个最典型的缺点。
    第一、某些党的工作者和鼓动员养成了只谈成绩不谈缺点和困难的习惯。当然，这就会减小鼓动的效果，而不能有助于消灭工作中的缺点。
    第二、许多党的工作者和鼓动员只愿意同集体农民举行座谈会，在会上向农民解释国家给予劳动人民的各种好处，但是小心翼翼地避免讨论加强劳动纪律、更高地要求每一个工作人员以及消灭集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场中依然存在的种种不良现象之类问题。
    集体农民正确地把党的工作者和鼓动员看成是我们党的代表和代言人，看成是为执行党的决议和维护劳动人民的利益而奋斗的战士。集体农民、机器拖拉机站或者国营农场的工作人员不但希望从他们那里听到关于党和政府的决议和最近的时事，而且还希望把自己的思想、自己所关心的问题和需要告诉他们并获得必要的帮助。对一个人冷淡就是对他的最大侮辱。凡是党的工作者忘记了这一点的地方，就一定存在许许多多的缺点。
    我们还必须提到区党委员会和区党委的机器拖拉机站指导员小组对于进行农村政治工作的特殊责任。目前在指导员小组中工作的有三万多人。这是一支巨大的力量，但是这种力量并没有完全发挥出来。不错，有许多指导员小组都已经成为在机器拖拉机站和集体农庄进行党的政治工作的真正组织者，但也有许多指导员小组还是不够真正组织者的水平。
    派遣干练的干部加强畜牧业的各个部门是党组织的一项紧急任务。最重要的是必须先从党员、共青团员、畜牧业革新者和专家中间挑选一些得力的组织者去充实集体农庄和国营农场的牲畜管理部门。集体农庄和国营农场的党支部必须更好地把共产党员和共青团员安置在生产岗位上，以便他们能够在发展畜牧业方面实际上起领导作用。我们还必须保证在各个区、机器拖拉机站、国营农场和集体农庄正确地分配农艺师和兽医，并且发挥他们在集体农庄和国营农场的畜牧业发展工作方面的作用。
    我们的党组织必须成为一切干部工作的心脏和灵魂，必须关心和重视进行畜牧业工作的每个人，及时地支持各种倡议，加强对工作的胜利的信心。
    我们的领导干部必须深入地研究农业生产问题，必须具有关于农业生产的经济问题和技术问题的丰富知识，了解农业和畜牧业方面的问题。除非这样，党和苏维埃机关的工作者就得不到群众的尊敬，就不可能正确地领导集体农庄、机器拖拉机站和国营农场。
    我们的报刊在改进党的农村政治工作方面应当起很大的作用。然而，有些共和国、州和区的报纸却没有经常地注意到集体农庄的实际发展情况，在这方面只是登载了一些浮光掠影和枯燥无味的消息和文章。它们没有充分地注意公有畜牧业的发展情况。党组织必须更加重视自己的报刊。
    党员和共青团员在群众中进行的组织工作必须能够推动人们把工作做得尽量好，鼓励他们发挥首创精神和积极性，必须有助于开展群众性的社会主义竞赛，以完成各种计划。我们苏维埃国家的力量就在于人民的团结一致，在于他们的爱国主义精神和劳动。我们的力量在于各族人民之间的友谊，我们一定要不断地发展和巩固这种友谊。
            ★　★　★
    同志们，苏联的工业和农业正在不断高涨，劳动人民的福利和文化正在不断提高。这是共产党实行列宁政策的结果，是苏维埃人民英勇劳动的结果，是他们团结在党的周围，忠实于伟大的共产主义事业、马克思—恩格斯—列宁—斯大林的事业的结果。
    我们的成就是巨大的，但是我们决不能就此满足，决不能因此而骄傲起来。我们应当以这些成就为基础，进一步发展重工业，坚持不渝地努力扩大消费品的生产，大力发展农业，以便不断增进苏维埃人民的福利。为此，我们必须开展大规模的社会主义竞赛，来进一步提高劳动生产率，提高产品的生产量和质量，改进国民经济各部门的技术。我们大家都应当毫不倦怠地进行我们伟大的和平建设工作，因为我们认识到我们所从事的工作是为人民和国家谋福利。这是愉快的、幸福的劳动，因为它的目的是进一步加强我们的可爱的苏维埃国家的实力，提高劳动群众的生活水平。
    同志们，让我表示我们的坚定信心：在共产党和它的中央委员会的领导下，工人阶级、集体农民和知识分子，全体苏联人民一定能够完成我国当前进一步发展农业的任务，并取得像在完成共产主义建设的其他宏伟任务中所取得的同样巨大的成就。
