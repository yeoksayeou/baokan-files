    The state-owned Tianjin Textile Machinery Factory is actively preparing to trial-produce various printing and dyeing machines for China's newly built printing and dyeing factories. The printing and dyeing machines to be trial-produced this year include eighteen types such as four-color, six-color, eight-color printing machines and bleaching combined machines. These machines are all automatically combined and require very few people to manage. Each process on the machine is equipped with automatic speed adjustment and automatic stop devices, which can not only ensure safe production but also guarantee the quality of printed and dyed fabrics, making them better than all printing and dyeing machines currently in China's printing and dyeing factories. The structure of these new products is relatively complex, with more than 14,000 drawings alone. Currently, the factory is conducting trial production of some mechanical parts such as return steam valves and safety valves, and mass trial production of printing and dyeing machines can begin in the second quarter.

    准备试制十八种新型印染机
    国营天津纺织机械厂正积极准备为我国新建印染厂试制各种印染机器。今年试制的印染机有四色六色、八色印花机和漂白联合机等十八种。这些机器都是自动联合的，只需很少的人管理。机器上每个工序设有自动调节速度和自动停车的装置，不仅能保证安全生产，还能保证印染色布的质量，比目前我国印染厂所有的印染机都好。这些新产品的构造比较复杂，仅图纸就有一万四千多张。目前该厂正在进行回汽阀、安全阀等部分机械的试制工作，第二季度就可开始大量试制印染机。
