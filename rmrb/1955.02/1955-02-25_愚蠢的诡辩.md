Foolish Sophistry

    On the eve of the Bangkok Conference, the British Information Services talked at length about the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In an international commentary entitled "The Bangkok Conference," it was stated: "All these principles are there: recognition of national sovereignty and territorial integrity; mutual non-aggression; non-interference in internal affairs; equality and mutual benefit; and peaceful coexistence. If these are the five principles of any agreement seeking peace, then the Manila Treaty conforms to all these principles."
    The British official news agency's hard-sell linking of the Five Principles with the Manila Treaty is, of course, not due to their ignorance, but to try to make people believe that the Manila Treaty is "non-aggressive." In other words, they are trying to use the Five Principles to cover up the aggressive nature of the Manila Treaty.
    This is impossible.
    The Manila Treaty clearly stipulates that Western colonial countries can, on the pretext of "any fact or situation endangering the peace of this region," arbitrarily designate its so-called "protected" area and extend its armed intervention to other parts of Asia. What does this have in common with the principle of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity?
    The Manila Treaty clearly stipulates that Western colonial countries can, on the pretext of preventing and combating so-called "subversive activities," arbitrarily interfere in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries and suppress the national liberation movements of Asia. What does this have in common with the principles of mutual non-aggression and non-interference in internal affairs?
    The Manila Treaty clearly stipulates that Western colonial countries can, on the pretext of developing so-called "economic measures," arbitrarily plunder strategic raw materials from Southeast Asia, enslave the Asian people, and continue and strengthen colonial rule. What does this have in common with the principle of equality and mutual benefit?
    The Manila Treaty clearly stipulates that Western colonial countries can, on the pretext of so-called "Communist aggression," arbitrarily invade and divide Asian countries and manipulate the fate of Asian countries. What does this have in common with the principle of peaceful coexistence?
    In fact, if the Manila Treaty has anything to do with the Five Principles jointly advocated by China, India, and Burma, it can only be said that the Manila Treaty is the opposite of the Five Principles. The commentator of the British Information Services actually equated the Manila Treaty with the Five Principles, which can be described as doing everything possible to confuse right and wrong and reverse black and white.
    As the Indonesian weekly "Sunday Courier" pointed out: "The Manila Treaty Organization is being used to suppress the national independence movements of Asia, suppress the peace movement in Asia, and create tension to benefit America's war aims." The aggressive, warlike, and colonial nature of the Manila Treaty is so obvious that the British "Observer" admitted as early as the signing of the Manila Treaty that it "is a treaty that is disliked by Asian neutral countries" and "has not been warmly welcomed anywhere." The American aggressive bloc and its followers want to use threats and inducements to drag more Asian countries, especially important countries in Southeast Asia, into this military bloc controlled by Western colonial countries, "pulling chestnuts out of the fire" for the instigators of war. However, peace-loving Asian countries see that joining such a military bloc will only harm national sovereignty and national independence, and will only increase the threat to peace in Asia. Ceylonese Prime Minister Kotelawala stated on February 18 that under the current circumstances, "the question of Ceylon joining this treaty will not arise." It can be seen that the Manila Treaty was, is, and will be even more so in the future, something "disliked" by peace-loving Asian countries.
    The attempt by the British official news agency to use the Five Principles to cover up the essence of the Manila Treaty shows that Western colonial countries have already felt the unpopularity of the Manila Treaty itself. More importantly, this incident also shows that the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are having an increasingly irresistible influence. As Indian President Prasad recently said, these principles "will increasingly become the basis of international relations, thereby guaranteeing peace and security throughout the world."
    No sophistry can turn war into peace, or aggression into defense; peace-loving Asian countries and people are firmly opposed to the Manila Treaty and actively support the Five Principles. The Asian people already have a clear understanding of the essence of the Manila Treaty. The activities of the American aggressive bloc and its followers in the Bangkok Conference have further deepened the Asian people's understanding: the Manila Treaty is a treaty that prepares for war, carries out aggression, and strengthens colonial rule. The attempt by the British Information Services to use the Five Principles to cover up the essence of the Manila Treaty is completely futile.

### 愚蠢的诡辩

    愚蠢的诡辩
    在曼谷会议开会的前夕，英国新闻处大谈关于和平共处的五项原则。在一篇题为“曼谷会议”的国际评论中竟这样说：“所有这些原则都在那里：承认国家主权和领土完整；互不侵犯；互不干涉内政；平等互利；和平共处。如果这些就是任何谋求和平的协定的五项原则的话，马尼拉条约是符合这一切原则的。”
    英国官方的新闻机关把五项原则同马尼拉条约硬扯在一起，当然不是由于他们的无知，而是为了企图使人们相信：马尼拉条约是“非侵略性的”。换一句话说，他们企图用五项原则来掩盖马尼拉条约的侵略性质。
    这是不可能的。
    马尼拉条约明明规定西方殖民国家可以借口
  “危及本区域和平的任何事实或情势”，任意指定它的所谓“保护”区域，把它的武装干涉扩展到亚洲其他地区。这同互相尊重主权和领土完整的原则有什么共同之处呢？
    马尼拉条约明明规定西方殖民国家可以借口防止和对付所谓“颠覆活动”，任意干涉东南亚各国的内政，镇压亚洲的民族解放运动。这同互不侵犯和互不干涉内政的原则有什么共同之处呢？
    马尼拉条约明明规定西方殖民国家可以借口发展所谓“经济措施”，任意搜括东南亚地区的战略原料，奴役亚洲人民，继续并加强殖民统治。这同平等互利的原则有什么共同之处呢？
    马尼拉条约明明规定西方殖民国家可以借口所谓“共产党侵略”，任意侵略和分裂亚洲国家，摆布亚洲国家的命运。这同和平共处的原则又有什么共同之处呢？
    事实上，如果说马尼拉条约同中印中缅所共同倡导的五项原则有任何关系的话，只能说马尼拉条约正是五项原则的反面。英国新闻处的评论员竟将马尼拉条约和五项原则等同起来，真可谓极尽混淆是非、颠倒黑白之能事。
    正如印度尼西亚“星期日信使”周刊所指出：“马尼拉条约组织正被用来镇压亚洲的民族独立运动，镇压亚洲的和平运动和制造紧张局势，以利于美国的战争目的。”马尼拉条约的侵略性质、战争性质和殖民主义性质是如此明显，以致英国的“观察家报”早在马尼拉条约签订之初，就承认它“是一个亚洲中立国家所讨厌”并“在任何地方都没有得到热烈欢迎”的条约。美国侵略集团和它的追随者想用威胁和利诱的办法，把更多的亚洲国家特别是东南亚的重要国家拖入这个西方殖民国家控制的军事集团，为战争挑拨者“火中取栗”。但是，爱好和平的亚洲国家都看到，参加这种军事集团只会给国家主权和民族独立带来损害，只会增加对亚洲和平的威胁。锡兰总理科特拉瓦拉二月十八日表示，在目前的情况下，“不会发生锡兰参加这个条约的问题”。由此可见，马尼拉条约过去是、今天仍然是、今后更将是爱好和平的亚洲国家“所讨厌”的东西。
    英国官方的新闻机关企图借助五项原则来掩盖马尼拉条约的实质，说明了西方殖民国家已经感到马尼拉条约本身的不得人心。更重要的，这一件事情还说明了和平共处五项原则正发生着越来越不可抗拒的影响。最近印度总统普拉沙德说得好，这些原则“将愈来愈成为国际关系的基础，从而保证全世界的和平和安全”。
    任何诡辩都不能把战争说成是和平，把侵略说成是防御；爱好和平的亚洲国家和人民是坚决反对马尼拉条约的，积极拥护五项原则的。亚洲人民对于马尼拉条约的实质已经有了明确的认识。美国侵略集团和它的追随者在曼谷会议中的活动进一步加深了亚洲人民的认识：马尼拉条约是准备战争的条约，肆行侵略的条约和加强殖民统治的条约。英国新闻处企图用五项原则来掩盖马尼拉条约的实质，完全是枉费心机。
