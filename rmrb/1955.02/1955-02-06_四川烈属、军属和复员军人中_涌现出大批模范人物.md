A large number of role models have emerged among the families of martyrs and soldiers and demobilized soldiers in Sichuan Province in industrial and agricultural production. In Pingchang County, an old revolutionary base area, among the 45 agricultural production cooperatives that have been established, 20 families of martyrs and soldiers have been elected as chairmen and vice-chairmen; 713 families of martyrs and soldiers serve as mutual aid team leaders; and more than 30 people have been named county-level agricultural labor models. Chen Bangbi, a special-class model military dependent in Yilong County, led a mutual aid team in operating waterwheels to fight drought, resulting in a bumper harvest of rice for the entire team. During the unified purchase and sale, in addition to taking the lead in selling 400 jin of surplus grain and 36 jin of cotton, she actively mobilized the villagers to sell more than 86,000 jin of grain. Because she plays a leading role in various tasks, she was elected as a county-level labor model and a representative of the Sichuan Provincial People's Congress. Gou Yinzhang, a disabled revolutionary soldier in Feiquan Township, Changning County, who is missing a leg, often kneels in the fields on one leg to dig soil, shovel field ridges, and weed, which increased rice production by three loads. Wang Boping, a demobilized soldier and telecommunications technician at Chongqing State-owned Factory 102, collected many discarded telecommunications equipment from scrap iron piles. After his own sorting and refinement, he remodeled 28 telephone sets, saving the country more than 29 million yuan. In September last year, he designed and installed a "Roddy-style dispatch switchboard" according to the Soviet advanced dispatch method, and was elected as a model worker by the factory's employees. Wei Mingyi, the leader of the valve group in Factory 501 and a military dependent, painstakingly studied technology and created 60 to 70 kinds of tools for grinding various "valves," improving the operation method. Using only a hand drill to grind "water inlet valves" increased work efficiency sixfold, and he was named a factory-level labor model and model party member, and was recently elected as a special-class model of preferential treatment in the city.
