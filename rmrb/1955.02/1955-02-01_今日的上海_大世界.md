Today's Shanghai "Great World"

    The Shanghai "Great World," the largest comprehensive amusement park famous in the Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou area, has become a legitimate cultural and entertainment venue for the working people since it was taken over by the Shanghai Municipal People's Government's Cultural Affairs Bureau in July 1954 and underwent preliminary renovations. This year during the Spring Festival, it has been further improved on the original basis. In addition to supplementing the existing twenty-plus theatrical troupes and performance units with new programs, it has added a puppet troupe and a motorcycle stunt show; a new recreation room has been opened, equipped with chess, billiards, table tennis, peep shows, etc.; a gallery has been added to exhibit pictures against the U.S.-Chiang treaty during the Spring Festival. To meet the needs of audiences from afar, a public canteen will be added, and a confectionery department will be added on each floor.
      "Great World" was founded in 1916. For the past thirty to forty years, it has been a tool for Shanghai's gangster bosses and their henchmen to swindle money from the working people, as well as a "base camp" for gangsters, prostitutes, and pickpockets. In the early days of Shanghai's liberation, it was once a "bomb shelter" for counter-revolutionaries and landlords who fled from various places. Before liberation, most of the performances in the venue were feudalistic, superstitious, and low-taste programs that poisoned the ideological consciousness of the working people. Some actors said in their grievances during the democratic reforms: "Although a few actors wanted to dedicate their art to the people in the past, the bosses always forced everyone to show their buttocks and thighs to the audience in order to make money. Real art could not survive in 'Great World.'" Gambling, theft, fortune-telling, and prostitution were rampant in the venue, and "Great World" was thus "notorious." People said: "The past 'Great World' was a microcosm of old Shanghai."
    On July 2, 1954, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government, in response to the demands of the broad masses of the people, took over "Great World" and carried out democratic reforms relying on progressive workers and actors. First, in the spirit of the country's general task during the transition period, in-depth political education was carried out for workers and actors, and new institutions were established; all theatrical troupes and performance units implemented a contract system, eliminating unreasonable employment relationships and improving the treatment of workers and actors; the trade union was reorganized; the venue's system and order were rectified, and bad elements and obscene, pornographic, and low-taste programs were eliminated, replaced by new programs such as "The Little Son-in-Law" (Yangzhou Opera), "Three Attacks on Zhujiazhuang" (Beijing Opera), "Hunting the Tiger" (Beijing Opera), "Liu Hulan" (Shanghai Opera), and "The Volunteer Army's Fiancée" (Ningbo Opera). After political education and democratic reform, actors have improved their political awareness and artistic level to a certain extent, initially clarified the direction of art serving the people, and performed earnestly and seriously, which is very popular among the audience. In the recent East China Opera Festival, Gu Yujun, a Yangzhou Opera actress performing at "Great World," won first prize, and Ding Manhua, a Yangzhou Opera actress, won third prize. "Great World" is moving towards a bright future of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and weeding through the old to bring forth the new." (Report from our Shanghai reporter station)

    今日的上海“大世界”
    闻名京沪杭一带的上海最大的一家综合性游艺场——“大世界”，自从一九五四年七月由上海市人民政府文化事业管理局接管，并经过初步改造以来，已成为劳动人民正当的文化娱乐场所。今年春节，它已在原有基础上继续改进。除原在这里演出的二十多个剧团和演出单位补充新的节目外，并增添木偶剧团和飞车；新辟文娱室，里面备有棋类、康乐球、乒乓球、拉洋片等；增设画廊，在春节展出反对美蒋条约的画片。为了适应远道观众的需要，要增设一个大众食堂，在每一层楼都添设一个糖果部。
      “大世界”创建于一九一六年。三、四十年来，它一直是上海流氓巨头及其爪牙向劳动人民刮钱的工具，又是流氓、妓女和扒手的“大本营”。上海解放初期，又曾经是反革命分子和各地流亡地主的“防空洞”。解放前场内演出的大部分是封建迷信和低级趣味的毒害劳动人民思想意识的节目。有些演员在民主改革中诉苦时说：“从前虽然有少数演员想把艺术献给人民，但是老板为了赚钱，总是强迫大家表演屁股、大腿给观众看，真正的艺术，在‘大世界’是吃弗开的。”场内赌博、偷窃、算命测字、妓女拉客之风盛行，“大世界”就是这样“臭名远扬”的。人们说：“过去的‘大世界’就是旧上海的缩影”。
    一九五四年七月二日，上海市人民政府接受广大人民的要求，接管了“大世界”，依靠进步职工和演员，进行了民主改革。首先以国家在过渡时期的总任务为中心内容，向职工和演员进行了深入的政治教育，同时建立了新的机构；各剧团和演出单位一律实行合同制度，消灭了不合理的雇佣关系，改善了职工和演员的待遇；改组了工会；整顿了场内制度和秩序，肃清了坏分子和下流、色情、低级趣味的节目，代之以“小女婿”（扬州剧）、“三打祝家庄”、“猎虎记”（京剧）、“刘胡兰”（沪剧）、“志愿军的未婚妻”
  （甬剧）等新节目。演员经过政治教育和民主改革，政治觉悟和艺术水平有一定提高，初步明确了艺术为人民服务的方向，演出态度认真严肃，很受观众欢迎。在最近一次华东戏曲观摩演出中，在“大世界”演出的扬剧女演员顾玉君获得了一等奖，扬剧女演员丁曼华获得了三等奖。“大世界”正在走向“百花齐放，推陈出新”的光明前途。　　　　　　（本报上海记者站）
