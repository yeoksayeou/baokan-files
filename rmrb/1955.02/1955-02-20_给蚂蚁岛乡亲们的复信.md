Reply to the Fellow Villagers of Ant Island
Editor,
To all dear fellow villagers of Ant Island, Putuo County:

We are artillery soldiers stationed on a forward outpost island on the Northeast coast. We are soldiers who participated in the cross-sea operation to liberate the Zhoushan Islands in 1949.

On January 9th, we saw your letter to us on the "Reader's Letters" page of the People's Daily. You said that you would use practical actions of increasing production and practicing thrift to support us in liberating Taiwan. Your determination is so firm and the guarantees you put forward are so concrete, which gave us great encouragement and strength. We sincerely thank you. At the same time, we deeply realize that the people of the motherland are vigorously supporting us in liberating Taiwan, and how glorious and important our responsibility should be! Vice Chairman Zhu De told us last year that if Taiwan is not liberated for one day, the Chinese People's Liberation Army will not have washed away the shame on its body. Therefore, we are currently stepping up training, improving combat skills, and moving towards a strong, regularized, and modernized national defense force. We are building an impregnable coastal defense line for the motherland, ready to strike at any enemy who dares to invade the motherland, and participate in the battle to liberate Taiwan. Although liberating Taiwan is still a long-term, complex, and arduous task, we guarantee that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and with the active support of the people of the whole country, we will resolutely do all the preparatory work before the war. As soon as Chairman Mao and the people of the whole country issue the order to attack, we will not hesitate to hold our weapons tightly, board the warship, cross the ocean, completely eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and the American imperialist aggressors who dare to obstruct our liberation of Taiwan, and liberate Taiwan and the suffering compatriots of Taiwan!

          The Entire Comrades of a Certain Company of a Certain Unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

    给蚂蚁岛乡亲们的复信编辑同志转亲爱的普陀县蚂蚁岛全体乡亲们：
    我们是驻守在东北海防前哨——海岛上的炮兵。我们是一九四九年参加渡海作战解放舟山群岛的战士们。
    我们在一月九日人民日报“读者来信专页”上，看到了你们写给我们的信。你们说要用增加生产、厉行节约的实际行动来支援我们去解放台湾，你们的决心是那么坚强，提出的保证又是那么具体，给了我们极大的鼓舞和力量，我们衷心地感谢你们。同时我们深深地体会到祖国人民都在大力地支援我们去解放台湾，我们的责任该是如何的光荣和重大啊！朱德副主席去年就告诉了我们，台湾一天不解放，我们中国人民解放军就一天没有洗清自己身上的耻辱。所以我们目前正在加紧训练，提高战斗技术，向着强大的正规化、现代化的国防军的方向迈进，我们在建设钢铁般的祖国海防线，准备随时打击任何敢于侵犯祖国的敌人，并参加解放台湾的战斗。虽然解放台湾还是一个长期、复杂、和艰巨的斗争任务，但是我们保证在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导和全国人民的积极支援下，坚决作好战前的一切准备工作，只等毛主席和全国人民发出进攻的号令，我们就毫不犹豫地握紧武器，登上战船，渡过海洋，彻底消灭蒋介石卖国集团和敢于阻扰我们解放台湾的美帝国主义侵略者，解放台湾和台湾的受难同胞！
          中国人民解放军某部某连全体同志
