The declaration adopted by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on February 9 at its second meeting has aroused widespread international reaction. Public opinion everywhere welcomes this declaration as a new and valuable initiative aimed at easing international tensions and further developing exchanges and mutual understanding between countries.

The Declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union puts forward principles that can now serve as the basis for peaceful relations between all countries, large and small, namely the principles of equality, non-interference in internal affairs, non-aggression and renunciation of encroachments on the territorial integrity of other countries, and respect for sovereignty and national independence. The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, India, and many other countries are already implementing these principles in their relations with other countries.

In contrast to these principles of international relations, imperialist aggressive blocs attempt to establish relations between countries and nations based on the domination of some countries and the submission of others. The notorious "policy of strength" essentially reflects their hope of declaring the policy of preparing and carrying out aggression against other countries as legitimate and inevitable.

These politicians interpret a series of diplomatic measures aimed at establishing military blocs as international cooperation. These military blocs are all based on the same "policy of strength," in which the strongest capitalist powers, militarily and economically, demand that their remaining partners submit to them and unquestioningly obey their orders.

It is this "policy of strength" that is causing the current international tension. The Declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union points out that the situation now prevailing in Europe and Asia, as well as in other parts of the world, exacerbates this tension and poses a threat to the security of all countries.

In Europe, military blocs have been built up by some European countries against others, and a dangerous policy of reviving German militarism is being pursued. Consequently, the danger of Europe becoming a battlefield for a new war is deepening. Such a war would inevitably turn into another world war. At the same time, the situation in Asia and the Far East cannot but cause concern for the fate of the world. Here, too, the people of all countries have a responsibility to prevent war and safeguard the national rights, independence, and sovereignty of the peoples of Asian countries. The arms race and the establishment of military bases on the territory of other countries are exacerbating tensions between countries. Some people are secretly preparing for atomic warfare behind the backs of the people. In some capitalist countries, frenzied war propaganda is now being carried out.

The Declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union states that all this requires countries committed to maintaining and consolidating peace to redouble their efforts to achieve such lofty goals as: the establishment of a European collective security system and the elimination of interference in the internal affairs of other countries, which is currently of particular importance for maintaining peace in the Far East.

The Soviet Union has consistently pursued a policy of consolidating peace and security, pointing out realistic ways to ease international tensions and establish broad international cooperation conducive to peace.

The people of all countries are very concerned about strengthening universal peace. It is entirely possible for them to prevent another war, because the forces of peace are constantly growing and are now stronger than the forces of aggression and war. Relying on the unbreakable unity of its people of all nationalities and its inexhaustible resources, the Soviet Union is fully determined to defend the peaceful labor of its citizens and protect them from all external aggression. The schemes of the aggressors cannot catch the Soviet people by surprise. The people of other countries will, as always, see the Soviet state as a strong and indestructible bulwark in the struggle for peace and progress.

In order to consolidate world peace, the Soviet Union believes that the arms race must be stopped. The issue of universal disarmament, starting with a significant reduction in the armaments of the major powers, must be resolved without delay. Atomic weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction must be banned, and effective international supervision should be used to ensure the implementation of relevant measures. These proposals made by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to the peoples and parliaments of all countries are in the vital interests of the people of all countries.

The declaration adopted by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union once again demonstrates very clearly that there are real possibilities for normalizing the international situation and improving relations between countries. To solve these extremely important tasks, it is urgently necessary to strengthen international exchanges that contribute to mutual understanding between countries. However, it must be pointed out that the ruling groups of countries participating in aggressive blocs, primarily the ruling groups of the United States, are doing everything possible to oppose this. Moreover, they are striving to paralyze the entire system of international exchanges. They hope that if they can block all major channels of international exchange, they can more easily sow seeds of distrust and discord among the people of all countries. That is why they are using various methods to prevent the working people, cultural workers, and social activists of capitalist countries from visiting the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democracies of Europe.

The declaration emphasizes that parliaments of all countries have a great responsibility for maintaining and consolidating peace. Because it is they who take legal action on issues of war and peace.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union believes that establishing direct contact between the parliaments of all countries, exchanging parliamentary delegations, and having parliamentary delegations of one country deliver speeches in the parliaments of other countries are in line with the wishes of the people of all countries to develop friendly relations and cooperation.

The declaration states that the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Socialist Republics will sincerely welcome any steps taken by the parliaments of other countries to strengthen international peace.

The reaction to the Declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union proves that this declaration has aroused the concern and sympathy of people from all walks of life abroad, including members of parliament of some countries. Many newspapers emphasized that the proposals of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union once again provide an opportunity to strengthen mutual understanding among the people of all countries.

The parliaments and people from all walks of life in the socialist and democratic camp warmly support the Declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China adopted a resolution endorsing and supporting the Declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic expressed the hope that the proposals of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union would also receive support in the parliaments of Western European countries.

Some Labor MPs in the British Parliament have tabled a resolution welcoming the Declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The resolution calls on the House of Commons to accept in principle the proposals contained in the Declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. According to newspaper reports, many Conservative MPs in the Canadian House of Commons and Senate are in favor of exchanging parliamentary delegations with the Soviet Union. Senator Horner said in the Canadian Senate: "I think this is an excellent suggestion, and therefore, I hope Canada will be one of the first countries to invite the Russians to exchange parliamentary delegations."

This reaction shows that the following proposition is increasingly penetrating the minds of the broad masses of the people: it is necessary to strengthen exchanges between countries, it is necessary to promote mutual understanding between countries, and it is necessary to remove from this road the many obstacles artificially created by the enemies of peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 16th: On February 12, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs handed a note to the diplomatic missions of all countries in Moscow, and attached the full text of the declaration adopted by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on February 9, 1955, including an appeal to the parliaments of other countries. Now is the time for them to express their attitude.

World public opinion sees that the Declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union points out a way to ease international tensions and consolidate international friendly cooperation. An increasingly broad range of people support the principles put forward in this declaration, regarding these principles as a guarantee for consolidating peace and security.

    苏联最高苏维埃宣言——具有重大国际意义的文件
    ——“真理报”二月十六日社论
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃今年二月九日在第二次会议上通过的宣言，引起了国际上的广泛的反应。各地的舆论欢迎这个宣言，认为这是一个旨在缓和国际紧张局势、进一步开展各国之间的交往和互相谅解的新的、宝贵的倡议。
    苏联最高苏维埃宣言提出了一些现在可以作为一切大小国家之间的和平关系的基础的原则，即平等、互不干涉内政、互不侵犯和放弃对他国领土完整的侵犯、尊重主权和民族独立的原则。苏联、中华人民共和国、印度以及许多其他国家，已经在它们同别国的关系中贯彻遵守这些原则。
    和这些国际关系的原则相反，帝国主义侵略集团企图在各个国家之间和各个民族之间建立一种以一些国家实行统治、另外一些国家俯首听命为基础的关系。臭名远扬的“实力政策”从本质上表现了他们希望宣布对其他国家准备和实行侵略的方针是合法的和不可避免的。
    这些政客们把旨在建立军事集团的一套外交措施解释为国际合作。这些军事集团都是建立在同样的“实力政策”的基础上的，在这些集团范围，那些在军事上、经济上最强的资本主义强国要其余的伙伴屈从它们，要这些伙伴毫无怨言地百依百顺。
    造成目前国际紧张局势的正是这种“实力政策”。苏联最高苏维埃的宣言中指出，现在在欧洲和亚洲以及世界其他地区形成的局势，加剧了这种紧张局势并且造成对各国安全的威胁。
    在欧洲，已经建成了一些欧洲国家为反对另一些欧洲国家而建立的军事集团，正在奉行着复活德国军国主义的危险政策。因而，欧洲可能变成新战争的战场的危险正在加深。而这样一场战争不可避免地将变成另一次世界大战。同时，亚洲和远东的局势同样也不能不引起对世界命运的忧虑。在这里，各国人民也有责任防止战争，保障亚洲各国人民的民族权利、他们的独立和主权。军备竞赛和在别国领土上建立军事基地的活动，加剧着各国间的紧张关系。有人在背着人民暗地准备着原子战争。在一些资本主义国家，现在正在进行疯狂的战争宣传。
    苏联最高苏维埃的宣言中说，所有这一切都要求致力于维护和巩固和平的国家加倍努力，以便达到这样一些崇高的目的，例如：建立欧洲集体安全体系，消除对其他国家的内政的干涉，这在目前对维护远东和平具有特别重要的意义。
    苏联一贯执行巩固和平和安全的政策，指出缓和国际紧张局势、建立有利于和平的广泛国际合作的现实道路。
    各国人民非常关心加强普遍的和平。他们完全有可能防止另一次战争，因为和平力量在不断增长，现在已经比侵略和战争势力强大了。苏联依靠它的各族人民的牢不可破的团结，依靠它的用之不竭的资源，有充分的决心来保卫它的公民的和平劳动，保护他们不受外来的一切侵略。侵略者的阴谋是不能使苏联人民措手不及的。其他各国人民像以往一样，将看到苏维埃国家是争取和平和进步的斗争中的一个坚强的、不可摧毁的堡垒。
    为了巩固全世界和平，苏联认为，必须停止军备竞赛。必须毫不拖延地解决普遍裁减军备、首先大大裁减各大国的军备的问题。必须禁止原子武器和所有其他大规模毁灭性武器，应该用有效的国际监督来保证有关措施的实行。苏联最高苏维埃的宣言中向各国人民和议会提出的这些建议，是符合各国人民的切身利益的。
    苏联最高苏维埃通过的宣言再一次十分明显地证明，使国际局势正常化和改善国与国之间的关系的实际可能性是存在的。要解决这些极其重要的任务，迫切需要加强有助于国与国之间的互相谅解的国际来往。然而，不能不指出的是，参加侵略集团的国家的统治集团，首先是美国的统治集团，想尽办法来反对这样做。不仅如此，他们更竭力使国际来往的整个体系陷于瘫痪。他们指望，如果能把国际来往的一切主要途径堵塞，那么他们就可以比较容易地在各国人民之间散布不信任和不和的种子。这就是为什么他们用各种办法阻挠资本主义国家的劳动人民、文化工作者和社会活动家去访问苏联、中华人民共和国、欧洲人民民主国家的原因。
    宣言着重指出，各国议会对维护和巩固和平负有重大的责任。因为，就战争和和平问题采取法律行动的就是它们。
    苏联最高苏维埃认为，各国议会之间建立直接的接触、互派议会代表团、一国的议会代表团在他国的议会中发表演说这些做法，是符合于各国人民发展友好关系和合作的愿望的。
    宣言中说，苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏
  维埃，将诚恳地欢迎其他国家的议会为加强国际和平而采取的任何步骤。
    对苏联最高苏维埃的宣言的反应证明，这一宣言引起了包括一些国家的议会议员在内的国外各界社会人士的关心和同情。许多报纸强调指出，苏联最高苏维埃的建议再一次为加强各国人民的相互谅解提供了可能。
    社会主义和民主阵营国家的议会和社会各界人士热烈拥护苏联最高苏维埃的宣言。中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会通过了拥护和支持苏联最高苏维埃宣言的决议。德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团的声明希望：苏联最高苏维埃的建议在西欧国家的议会中也会获得支持。
    一些工党议员在英国议会中提出了一项欢迎苏联最高苏维埃的宣言的决议案。这个决议案要求下院在原则上接受苏联最高苏维埃的宣言中所包含的建议。据报纸报道，加拿大众议院和参议院的许多保守党议员赞成和苏联互派议会代表团。参议员霍尔纳在加拿大参议院中说：“我想，这是一个极好的建议，因此，我希望加拿大将是首先邀请俄国人互派议会代表团的国家之一。”
    这种反应说明，下面的主张日益深入广大社会人士的心灵中，这就是：必须加强国与国之间的来往，必须促进各国之间的相互谅解，并且从这条道路上消除和平的敌人所人为造成的许多障碍。
    二月十二日，苏联外交部把一份照会递交给各国驻莫斯科外交使馆，并且附上一份苏联最高苏维埃一九五五年二月九日通过的、包括有向其他国家议会发出的呼吁的宣言全文。现在，该是它们表示态度的时候了。
    世界舆论界看到：苏联最高苏维埃的宣言指出了一条缓和国际紧张局势和巩固国际友好合作的道路。日益广泛的社会人士拥护这个宣言中所提出的原则，把这些原则看作是巩固和平和安全的保障。
