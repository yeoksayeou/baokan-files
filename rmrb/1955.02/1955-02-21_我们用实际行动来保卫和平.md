    We Defend Peace with Practical Actions
    Agricultural Labor Model Li Shunda
    When the members of our Xigou Township Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative heard the news of the World Peace Council Standing Committee's call to launch a signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons, they unanimously expressed their warm support. All of our cooperative members, combined with the current work of recruiting supplementary soldiers and spring plowing production, conducted a heated discussion on this call. Every member expressed extreme anger and disgust at the barbaric actions of the American aggression group clamoring for the use of atomic weapons. Young people such as Ma Heidan and Zhao Mancai also signed up to enlist in the army at the meeting. They said, "Peace must be won through struggle. No matter what the American imperialists shout, victory will ultimately belong to the people. We will definitely recover our territory and bring back commemorative medals for liberating Taiwan."
    We also decided to respond to this call with the following practical actions: First, we will launch a widespread propaganda campaign throughout the township, penetrating into mountain villages and remote hamlets, so that every household is aware of it, and all people in the township, regardless of gender or age, participate in this movement, giving the American aggression group and the planners of atomic warfare a serious warning. Second, we will further publicize the great significance of the Sino-Soviet friendship alliance and further consolidate the friendly unity of the people of China and the Soviet Union, making the friendly unity of our two great countries a pillar for defending peace in Asia and the world. Third, in addition to actively enlisting according to the needs of the motherland, we will educate young people of eligible age to remain vigilant at all times, focusing on both production and physical exercise, so as to respond to the call of the motherland at any time. Fourth, we will launch labor competitions to ensure the realization of the plan to increase production by 25 jin of grain per mu and appropriately expand the planting area of oil crops. Fifth, we will do a good job in providing preferential treatment and substitute farming work, ensuring that the lives of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers improve simultaneously with the lives of cooperative members, and that their daily lives are also well taken care of.

    我们用实际行动来保卫和平
    农业劳动模范  李顺达
    我们西沟乡农林牧生产合作社的社员们，在收听到世界和平理事会常务委员会号召开展反对使用原子武器的签名运动的消息时，一致表示热烈拥护。我们全体社员，结合着当前征集补充兵员和春耕生产工作，对这个号召进行了热烈的讨论，每个社员对美国侵略集团叫嚣使用原子武器的野蛮行动，表示非常愤恨与憎恶。马黑旦和赵满财等青年并在会上报名应征参军，他们说：“和平要从斗争中得来，不管美帝国主义叫喊什么，胜利终归是属于人民的，我们一定收复我们的领土，要带回解放台湾的纪念章。”
    我们并决定以下面的实际行动来响应这个号召。一、在全乡广泛地开展一个宣传运动，深入山庄窝铺，做到家喻户晓，使全乡不分男女老少，都来参加这个运动，给美国侵略集团和原子战争的策划者一个严重警告。二、进一步宣传中苏友好同盟的重大意义，进一步巩固中苏两国人民的友好团结，使我们两个伟大国家的友好团结，成为保卫亚洲及世界和平的支柱。三、教育合龄青年，除根据祖国需要踊跃应征外，并时时保持警惕，一面搞好生产一面锻炼身体，以便随时响应祖国召唤。四、开展劳动竞赛，保证实现每亩多收二十五斤原粮的增产计划，并适当扩大油料作物的种植面积。五、做好优抚代耕工作，保证烈军属入社后和社员生活同时上升，日常生活也能得到很好照顾。
