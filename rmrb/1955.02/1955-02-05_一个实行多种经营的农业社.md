    An Agricultural Cooperative Engaging in Diversified Operations
    By our reporter Ai Ling
    Not long ago, we visited the Dawan Township First Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shunde County, Guangdong's Pearl River Delta.
    While the north was covered in white snow, there was no sign of winter here. Outside the village was a green field, and the leaves of the fruit trees by the village rustled in the wind. A small river quietly flowed around the village, and clumps of wild daffodils floated on the water from time to time. Here, we rarely saw cattle, but many boats. The farmers, dressed in single layers of clothing and barefoot, rowed their small boats back and forth on this small river. The boats were full of sugar cane and freshwater fish, most of which were being transported to the purchasing stations in the town. The waterways here are well-connected, and you can row a small boat to the town from the fields.
    Lu Hongxi, the cooperative's director, took us to see the cooperative's crops. He told us, "More than 80 percent of the farmers in the township are engaged in fish ponds, silkworm breeding, and sugar cane cultivation. The cooperative operates entirely on these crops." He continued, "These crops have natural connections. Those who raise fish rarely don't raise silkworms, because the best feed for fish is silkworm droppings; to raise silkworms, you have to plant mulberry trees. A picul of mulberry leaves eaten by silkworms can produce seventy catties of silkworm droppings, and eight piculs of silkworm droppings can raise one picul of fish. The fertile mud at the bottom of the fish pond is also a good fertilizer for sugar cane and mulberry trees. If the fish pond lacks fertilizer, the fish won't grow big, and if bulrushes grow in the pond, that's terrible. If you want to fertilize the pond again at that time, it will take at least a year or two. ..." Just as he was saying this, we arrived at the fish pond. The fish pond was like a mirror in the sunlight. Fish jumped out of the water from time to time. Mulberry trees, sweet potatoes, and cabbages were planted around the pond.
    "Do the fish grow fast?" I asked.
    "They grow quite fast. If you put in a hundred catties of bighead carp fry, they will grow at least three catties a month. If you put enough fry into each mu of pond—a hundred grass carp, thirty bighead carp, and a thousand mud carp—you can produce at least a thousand catties of fish, calculated on the basis of three crops a year."
    "What? Are several kinds of fish raised in the fish pond?"
    "Yes! You may find it strange, but all the fish ponds here raise these three kinds of fish. The bighead carp float on the upper layer, and they defecate for the grass carp in the middle layer to eat; the mud carp at the bottom take the grass carp's droppings as high-quality food. Mud carp are also afraid of the cold, so the bottom layer is most suitable."
    The richness of the motherland and the arrangements of nature aroused the interest of the visitors. Ahead was a clump of sugar cane forest, and the cooperative director casually broke off a branch of sugar cane and shared it with us: "Try it, this is the best variety we promoted this year. Each mu can yield more than ten thousand catties of sugar cane, which can be squeezed into more than a thousand catties of white sugar."
    We then visited the cooperative's silkworm rearing rooms and pigsties. Baskets of yellow cocoons were stored in the silkworm rearing rooms. These are the last batch, and they will soon be sold to the state purchasing station. Although the silkworm rearing room is an old house, it has windows on all sides, mosquito nets, and fans. Only the cooperative has a silkworm rearing room with such reasonable equipment. There is a square in front of the pigsty where the pigs can come out to bask in the sun and take a walk after they are full. Every pig is very clean, and you can't smell any odor. The pigs are all fed with a mixture of bran and wild vegetables. The people who contract to raise pigs wear white clothes to work. They take good care of the pigs. When it's hot, the pigs are bathed three or four times a day; they are given medicine to prevent swine fever; and pigs with skin diseases are bathed with disinfectant. Therefore, the pigs in the cooperative not only grow fast, but not a single one has ever died. The unit yield of each agricultural product of this cooperative is higher than that of the farmers in the whole township.
    This cooperative, the first to be established in the whole township, pointed out a happy path to socialism for the farmers in the whole township. Many farmers applied to join the cooperative and are preparing to establish the second and third cooperatives. After dinner, people walked into the cooperative's meeting place with smiles on their faces, discussing and arranging their new lives.
    In the past, although the various crops in this area had unique natural conditions, they were not fully utilized. Needless to say about the tragic life in the old society; even after liberation, when the farmers turned over and got the land, there were still many difficulties in developing production. Everyone knows that although there are many benefits to operating these crops, they require large investments and specialized technology; if you don't do it well, you will lose money or even go bankrupt. A mu of fish pond requires an investment of more than 250,000 yuan per year just to release fish fry, and each mu of sugar cane requires 80,000 yuan to replace the cane heads. Fish and silkworms are even more vulnerable to disasters. After the farmers turned over, their families were poor, and the silkworms were not well raised. "Falling silkworms" (silkworms that are raised but do not produce cocoons) became commonplace. No matter how hard individual farmers worked, they could not manage several crops well at the same time. Of the eight households raising silkworms, only one made money, and the others all lost money. 社员廖腾's silkworm rearing room had poor air circulation and a shortage of manpower, losing 1.5 million yuan at once; 养鱼的卢洪和两兄弟 did not have enough funds, so they could only raise one crop before they could not afford to raise any more. Individual farmers could not withstand one or two disasters before going bankrupt. Like 社员卢国忠, there were five people working in the family; however, there was not enough capital, food shortages, low yields, and one person was ill, making life unsustainable. Some farmers were preparing to sell their boats. Just as many people's lives were gradually going downhill, the Party and the People's Government sent work teams to lead them to organize and establish cooperatives. They put all 94 mu of land in the cooperative (of which 66 mu were fish ponds, 14 mu were mulberry fields, and 14 mu were sugar cane fields), and seven boats were also invested as shares. As soon as the land was unified and used rationally, the yields of various crops increased crop after crop. Although the sugar cane suffered from wind and drought this year, the organized strength was great, and irrigation and fertilization were better than those of ordinary farmers, so the total yield of sugar cane per mu reached about 10,000 catties. The increase in fish production in the cooperative was even greater. In the year before last, it only produced 20,300 catties. Last year, due to a fish plague, part of it was lost, and there were still 39,000 catties, an increase of more than 90% compared to the year before last. Their increase in silkworm silk production shocked the whole county. Last year, a total of 16 batches of silkworms were raised, and each batch was a bumper harvest. The total output of one crop was more than 4,600 catties; the droppings from these silkworms can raise more than 6,200 catties of fish. Although it has not yet been accurately calculated, it is estimated from the partially harvested crops that the total income of the cooperative is more than 200 million yuan; after deducting costs, the income of each household is more than 7 million yuan. The income of each household in the mutual aid group is at most five or six million yuan, and the income of individual households is even less. The cooperative is changing the conservative habits of farmers in Dawan Township in terms of production technology: in the past, sugar cane fields here were never watered, but they irrigated the sugar cane fields with water during the drought; in the past, there was very little winter planting, but last winter they took the lead in planting 30 mu; especially the use of reasonable scientific methods to raise silkworms and pigs has had a great impact on the farmers in the whole township. Now many farmers are learning from their advanced experience in production.
    They have realized the benefits of organizing from their actual lives, and they have also realized the close relationship between farmers and the country. When the cooperative built silkworm rearing rooms, the government also sent technical cadres to guide them and provided excellent silkworm and sugar cane seeds; the supply and marketing cooperative supplied new silkworm equipment in a timely manner according to the contract; when there were difficulties in funding, the credit cooperative supported them, and this year's loans amounted to more than 60 million yuan. Everyone in the cooperative knows that increased production is good for the country's industrialization; the raised fish are indispensable non-staple foods, sugar cane is also an industrial raw material, and silk is the country's most valuable export material. Therefore, all the products of the cooperative were sold to the state's aquatic products company and purchasing station at the prices stipulated by the state and according to the pre-arranged contract.
    The 社员们, seeing the development of national construction, the improvement of the cooperative's production, and the increase in personal income, have even stronger confidence in increasing production. When I asked several 社员们 in the cooperative, "What are you going to do with the money you earn?" they replied in unison, "We have just started to increase production, so we can't talk about surplus; the investment in production is large, and the returns are great; in addition to keeping enough to eat and use, we will still invest the money in production."

    一个实行多种经营的农业社
    本报记者  艾玲
    不久以前，我们在广东珠江三角洲上的顺德县访问了大晚乡第一农业生产合作社。
    正当北方白雪皑皑的时候，这里却没有一点儿冬天景象。村外一片碧绿的原野，村边果树的叶子被风吹得哗啦啦响，小河环着村子静静地流着，水面上不时飘来一堆野水仙。这里很少看到耕牛，却看到很多船艇。农民们穿着单衣，赤着脚，划着小艇往返在这条小河上。船上载满了甘蔗、淡水鱼，大部分是运到镇上的收购站去的。这里水路四通八达，下地上镇都可以划着小艇去。
    社主任卢洪锡带我们参观了他们社里的作物。他告诉我们：“全乡有百分之八十以上农民都是经营鱼塘、桑蚕、甘蔗。合作社经营的全部是这几种作物。”接着说：“这几种作物有着天生的连系。养鱼的很少不养蚕，因为鱼的最好饲料是蚕粪；要养蚕就得种桑树。蚕吃一担桑叶可以拉七十斤蚕粪，八担蚕粪可以养大一担鱼。鱼塘底的肥泥，又是甘蔗和桑树的好肥料。如果鱼塘缺少肥料，鱼不大，塘里生了茜草、那就糟透了，那时你想再把塘弄肥，至少得一两年工夫。……”正说到这里，我们已到了鱼塘边。鱼塘被阳光照得像一面镜子。不时有鱼跳跃到水面上来。塘边种满了桑树、蕃薯、白菜。
    “鱼长得快不快？”我问。
    “长得不慢，下一百斤大头鱼苗，一个月起码长三斤；每亩塘下足鱼苗鲩鱼一百条，大头鱼三十条，鲮鱼一千条，按一年三造计算，至少可以产一千多斤鱼。”
    “怎么？鱼塘养着几种鱼吗？”
    “是啊！也许你们会觉得奇怪，我们这里所有的鱼塘都养着这三种鱼。上层浮游的都是大头鱼，它拉下粪给中层的鲩鱼吃；在最底层的鲮鱼便把鲩鱼粪当作上等食料。鲮鱼还怕冷，所以在底层最合适。”
    祖国的富饶，自然界的安排，引起了参观者的兴趣。前面便是一丛丛的甘蔗林，社主任随手折了一枝甘蔗分给我们：“你们尝尝，这就是我们今年推广的最好的品种，一亩地可收一万多斤甘蔗，能榨出一千多斤白糖。”
    我们接着参观了社里的蚕房和猪房。蚕房里贮放着一筐筐的黄茧。这是最后的一批了，很快就也要卖给国家的收购站。蚕房虽然是一座旧房子，但四面开窗，钉着防蝇帐，装上拉风扇。像这样有合理设备的蚕房，只有合作社才有。在猪房门口有一个广场，是猪吃饱后出来晒太阳散步的地方。每条猪都很干净，叫人闻不到一点臭气。猪都是用糠和野菜的混合物喂大的。包工养猪的人穿着白衣在工作。对猪照顾得很周到。天热时，要给猪每天洗三、四次澡；防猪瘟时给猪吃药；有皮肤病的猪要用消毒药水洗澡。因此，社里的猪不仅长大得快，而且从没有死过一条。这个合作社的每种农产品都比全乡农户的单位产量高。
    这个全乡最初成立的合作社，给全乡农民指出了一条走向社会主义的幸福之路。许多农民申请加入这个社，并且准备成立第二、第三个社。人们吃过晚饭后，都笑嘻嘻地走进合作社的会场里，讨论着和安排着自己的新生活。
    过去，尽管这一带的各种农作物有着得天独厚的自然条件，却没有得到充分利用。在旧社会的悲惨生活就不用说了；就是解放后，农民翻了身，得到了土地，发展生产还是有不少困难。谁都知道，经营这些作物虽说收益多，可是需要投资大，并且需要专门技术；弄不好，就要亏本，甚至破产。一亩鱼塘、每年单投放鱼苗就要有二十五万元以上的投资，每亩甘蔗换一次蔗头也得八万元，鱼和蚕更是经不起一点儿灾难。农民翻身后家底薄，蚕养不好，
  “倒蚕”（养的蚕不结茧）成了惯事。单干的农民无论怎样辛勤劳动，也没法同时把几种作物都经营好。
    大晚乡第一农业生产合作社是去年春耕时才成立起来的。短短的一年时间，他们就突破了贫困的重围，开始过着逐渐富裕的生活。在合作社成立以前，各户的困难和全乡农民一样；全社十三户有四十八口人，劳动力只有二十七个，有十户缺口粮。每户的鱼塘都没有资金下足鱼苗，浪费地亩很大，鱼养得也不合理——大鱼塘养了小鱼，小鱼塘却养了大鱼；有的鱼挨饿死了，有的鱼吃得过饱。养蚕的顾不上种桑或者没有本钱买桑叶；有桑树的和养蚕的“各执一把刀”，互相克制。许多户在生产上顾此失彼，样样搞不好。养蚕的八户中，只有一户赚钱，其他各户都亏本。社员廖腾的蚕房空气不好，人手又少，一下亏了一百五十万元；养鱼的卢洪和两兄弟没有资金，只养了一造便养不起了。个体农民是经不起一次两次灾害就要破产的。就像社员卢国忠，家里有五口人劳动；可是资金不足，口粮缺，收成低，加上有一个人病了，闹得生活无法维持。有的农户准备卖艇。正当许多人生活将要逐渐走下坡路时候，党和人民政府派工作队来领导他们组织起来，成立了合作社。他们把全社土地九十四亩（其中鱼塘占六十六亩，桑地十四亩，蔗地十四亩），和船七只都入了股。土地刚一统一经营合理使用，各种作物就一造比一造增产。今年甘蔗虽然受到风、旱的灾害，但组织起来力量大，灌溉、施肥都比一般农户做得好，因此甘蔗每亩总产量达到一万斤左右。社里的鱼的增产数量更大，前年只产二万零三百斤，去年因发生鱼瘟损失一部分，还有三万九千斤，比前年增产了百分之九十以上。他们的蚕丝的增产震动了全县，去年共饲养十六批蚕，每一批都丰收了，一造的总产量就有四千六百多市斤；这些蚕拉下的粪，可以养大六千二百多斤鱼。虽然还没有准确地计算，但从已收获的部分作物估计，全社总收入在二亿元以上；除了成本，每户收入在七百万元以上。互助组各户的收入顶多五六百万元，单干户的收入就更少了。合作社改变着大晚乡农民生产技术上的保守的习惯：这里过去甘蔗地是从来不浇水的，他们旱灾时用水灌溉了甘蔗地；这里过去是很少冬种的，去年冬耕时他们带头种了三十亩；特别是用合理的科学方法饲育蚕和猪，对全乡农民影响很大。现在许多农民都在学习他们生产上的先进经验。
    他们从实际生活中体会到了组织起来的好处，也体会到了农民和国家的密切关系。合作社建蚕房时，政府还派技术干部来指导，还供给优良的蚕种、蔗种；供销合作社按合同及时供应了新蚕具；资金困难时，有信用合作社支持，今年贷款有六千多万元。社里谁都知道，增产对国家工业化有好处；养的鱼是不可缺少的副食品，甘蔗也是工业原料，蚕丝是国家出口最有价值的物资。因此，全社的生产品，全部按国家规定价格和预定合同卖给了国家的水产公司和收购站。
    社员们看到国家建设的发展、全社生产的提高和个人收入的增加，增产的信心更强了。当我问社里的几个社员们“你们收入的钱准备怎样用”的时候，他们异口同声地回答：“我们刚开始增产，谈不上剩余；在生产上投资大，收益便大；我们除留够吃够用以外，还是把钱投到生产上去。”
