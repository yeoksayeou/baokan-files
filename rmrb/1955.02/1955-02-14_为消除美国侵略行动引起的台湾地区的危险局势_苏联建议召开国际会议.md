(Xinhua News Agency, February 13th) TASS Moscow, February 12th: It has been previously reported that Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov held talks with British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Hayter, on January 28th and 31st regarding the situation in Taiwan and other coastal islands of China.

On February 2nd, British Foreign Secretary Eden delivered an informal statement from the British government to the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in the United Kingdom, Belokhvostikov, addressing the situation that has arisen in the aforementioned Chinese island areas.

On February 4th, Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov met with the British Ambassador and issued the following statement:

"The Soviet government, as indicated in its statement of January 31st, shares the concern of the British government regarding the dangerous situation that has arisen in Taiwan and other coastal islands of China. This existing situation is endangering the maintenance of peace and increasing the risk of a new war.

The Soviet government believes that the reason for this situation in that region is that the United States of America, with the assistance of Chiang Kai-shek, seized the Chinese island of Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and some other Chinese islands many years ago. Recently, the United States has resumed its aggressive actions in this region, which has further intensified the tense situation.

This is manifested in the unwarranted armed attacks by armed forces under U.S. control on Chinese cities and coastal areas, the concentration of U.S. naval and air forces in the aforementioned regions, and the official statements by U.S. politicians threatening to use armed forces against the People's Republic of China.

In order to eliminate the dangerous situation in the Taiwan area caused by U.S. interference in China's internal affairs and the recent intensification of U.S. aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China, the Soviet government has submitted a proposal to the Security Council for its consideration regarding the "aggressive acts of the United States of America against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan and other island regions of China." The Soviet government put forward this proposal in an effort to normalize the situation in the Taiwan area and consolidate peace in the Far East.

When submitting this issue to the Security Council, the Soviet government suggested that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China should be invited to send a representative as the legitimate representative of China to participate in the work of the Security Council, and that the representative of Chiang Kai-shek, who illegally occupies a seat in the United Nations, should be removed from the Security Council.

As can be seen from the reply from the Government of the People's Republic of China, transmitted through the Secretary-General of the United Nations, it has agreed to participate in the discussion of the Soviet proposal in the Security Council, provided that the Kuomintang representative can be removed from the Security Council and the representative of the People's Republic of China can attend the Security Council as the legitimate representative of China.

As can be seen from the British government's statement and the position taken by its representative in the Security Council, the United States and the United Kingdom are unwilling to consider the just and legitimate demand of the People's Republic of China, thereby making it impossible for the Security Council to legally and impartially discuss the situation in Taiwan and other Chinese island areas and take appropriate measures to ease the tension in the region and protect the national rights of the People's Republic of China.

In order to consolidate peace and ease international tensions in the Far East, the Soviet government believes that, under these circumstances, it would be appropriate to seek other ways to facilitate a solution to the issue of the situation in the aforementioned region.

The Soviet government believes that it would be appropriate to hold a conference of countries that are particularly concerned about the normalization of the situation in Taiwan and other Chinese island areas to discuss this issue.

In addition to the People's Republic of China and the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, India, Burma, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Ceylon could participate in such a conference.

We believe that an initiative in this regard could be put forward by the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and India, if the British government and the Indian government agree to this step.

Such an initiative is in line with Mr. Eden's expressed desire for joint efforts by Britain and the Soviet Union to resolve outstanding international issues.

As for the time and place of the meeting, the Soviet government believes that this meeting could be held in Shanghai or New Delhi in February this year.

The Soviet government expresses the hope that the British government will study these opinions of the Soviet government and put forward its own opinions."

On the same day, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov met with Indian Chargé d'Affaires ad interim P. Gaul and handed him a similar statement from the Soviet government regarding the situation in Taiwan and other coastal islands of China.

Negotiations are continuing.

    为消除美国侵略行动引起的台湾地区的危险局势
    苏联建议召开国际会议
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十二日电：报界前已报道，苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫在一月二十八日和三十一日同英国驻苏联大使海特尔就台湾和其他中国沿海岛屿地区产生的局势问题进行了谈话。
    二月二日，英国外交大臣艾登交给苏联驻英国代办别洛赫沃斯齐科夫一项英国政府的非正式声明，声明谈到在上述中国岛屿地区已经产生的局势。
    二月四日，苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫接见了英国大使，发表下列声明：
    “苏联政府，如在它一月三十一日的声明中已经指出的，像英国政府一样，关心已经在台湾和中国沿海其他岛屿地区产生的危险局势。这种现存的局势正在危及和平的维护，正在增加新战争的危险。
    苏联政府认为在那个地区所以产生这种局势的原因是：美利坚合众国在蒋介石的协助下，早在几年以前就霸占了属于中国的台湾岛，澎湖列岛和中国的一些其他岛屿。最近，美国恢复了它在这个地区的侵略行动，这就更进一步地加剧了紧张局势。
    这表现在美国控制下的武装部队对中国的城市和沿海地区进行无端的武装攻击上，表现在美国的海空军部队集结在上述地区上，也表现在美国政治家们威胁着要对中华人民共和国使用武装部队的正式声明上。
    为了消除由于美国干涉中国内政以及美国最近加紧对中华人民共和国的侵略行动而引起的台湾地区的危险局势，苏联政府曾向安全理事会提出了一个“关于美利坚合众国在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为”的建议供它审议。苏联政府提出这项建议，是竭力要促使台湾地区的局势正常化和巩固远东的和平。
    苏联政府在安全理事会提出这个问题时建议：应当邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府派遣一个代表作为中国的合法代表参加安全理事会的工作，非法窃居联合国中席位的蒋介石代表应当从安全理事会中去除。
    从中华人民共和国政府通过联合国秘书长转达的答复中可以看出，它已同意参加讨论苏联在安全理事会提出的建议，只要国民党代表能从安全理事会去除，中华人民共和国代表能作为中国的合法代表出席安全理事会。
    从英国政府的声明以及它的代表在安全理事会所采取的立场可以看出，美国和英国不愿意考虑中华人民共和国这个正义的合法的要求，从而使安全理事会不可能合法地和公正地讨论在台湾和其他中国岛屿地区的局势并采取适当的措施以缓和这个地区的紧张局势和保护中华人民共和国的民族权利。
    为了巩固和平和缓和远东国际紧张局势，苏联政府认为，在这种情况下，设法寻求其他的办法来促成解决关于上述地区局势的问题将是适宜的。
    苏联政府认为，如果由对台湾和其他中国岛屿地区所产生的局势的正常化特别关心的国家来举行会议讨论这个问题将是适宜的。
    除了中华人民共和国和美国以外，英国，苏联，法国，印度，缅甸，印度尼西亚，巴基斯坦和锡兰可以参加这样一个会议。
    我们认为，这方面的倡议可以由英国、苏联和印度来提出，如果英国政府和印度政府同意这个步骤的话。
    这样一种倡议是符合艾登先生表示的关于需要英苏两国联合努力来解决悬而未决的国际问题的愿望的。
    至于会议的时间和地点，苏联政府认为，这个会议可以在今年二月间在上海或新德里举行。
    苏联政府表示希望，英国政府会研究苏联政府的这些意见，并且提出它自己的意见。”
    在同一天，苏联外交部长莫洛托夫接见了印度临时代办普·高尔，交给他苏联政府关于台湾和其他中国沿海岛屿地区所产生的局势的一份同样的声明。
    谈判在继续中。
