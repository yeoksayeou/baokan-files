    Spring ploughing has begun in parts of Sichuan
    The fields of Sichuan are already a verdant green; peas are flowering, rapeseed is bolting, and wheat is budding. In places like Fushun, many farmers have started delivering manure and plowing the fields. Tense spring ploughing has generally started on more than three million mu of farmland in the Luzhou area.
    To prepare for spring ploughing, 20,000 new-style farm tools will be delivered to the farmers successively, and supply and marketing cooperatives are preparing to supply 450,000 tons of various fertilizers. The Shehong County Bank has also issued loans for draft cattle in advance, helping the masses buy back 447 head of draft cattle. In the construction of a large number of small-scale water conservancy projects, the 36 ponds and weirs built in Qinggang Township, Bishan alone, can irrigate 15,000 mu of land. More than 8,300 new agricultural cooperatives established before spring have actively engaged in production. The Yong'an Agricultural Cooperative in Jiange County accumulated 180,000 jin of fertilizer in six days, and 92 new cooperatives in Suining County have implemented small-scale contract work and are producing according to plan.

    四川部分地区开始春耕
    四川的田野里已经一遍青绿，豌豆开了花，油菜在抽苔，小麦正孕穗。富顺等地许多农民开始送粪犁田。紧张的春耕已在泸州专区三百多万亩农田上普遍展开。
    为准备春耕，全省有两万部新式农具将陆续送到农民手中，供销合作社准备供应各种肥料四十五万吨。射洪县银行并提前发放耕牛贷款，帮助群众买回耕牛四百四十七头。在兴修大批小型水利中，仅璧山青杠乡修的三十六处塘堰就可灌溉一万五千亩田。春前新建的八千三百多个农业社已积极投入生产，剑阁县永安农业社六天积肥十八万斤，遂宁县已有九十二个新社实行小包工按照计划生产。
