    “Pravda” and “The Observer” Point Out:
    Mendès France’s Downfall Shows the Failure of American Policy
    [Xinhua News Agency, February 7th] (TAS, Moscow, February 6th) – “Pravda” published an article by “Observer” commenting on the resignation of the French government of Mendès France.
    The article points out that Mendès France came to power at a time when the French ruling groups' policies in Indochina and Europe were being condemned, and French public opinion demanded policies that conformed to national interests. Under the pressure of public opinion, Mendès France agreed to end the colonial war in Indochina. However, after taking one step forward, he subsequently took two steps backward on the issues of Asian and European policy.
    France signed the treaty establishing the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc. This bloc was established by the American aggressive group in the hope of nullifying the positive results of the Geneva Conference.
    In terms of European policy, after the National Assembly rejected the "European Army" plan, the Mendès France government exhausted all its efforts to get the parliament to quickly approve the new agreement to revive West German militarism. In this regard, the American ruling groups placed great hopes, thinking that this government, which had demonstrated a desire to act in accordance with French national interests at the Geneva Conference, would more easily get the plan for the remilitarization of West Germany passed in parliament.
    The article continues, but this conspiracy failed. A powerful popular movement against the Paris Accords unfolded throughout France. In parliament, the majority supporting the government was constantly decreasing. When the Paris Accords barely passed, Mendès France exhausted all his tricks and only obtained a majority of twenty-seven votes.
    The article says that Mendès France's American supporters later had only one hope for him: that he could use various means to get the Paris Accords approved by the National Assembly and the Council of the Republic. The Associated Press reported that Washington regretted the collapse of the Mendès France government because the “timetable for ratification (of the Paris Accords)” had become uncertain. This made Washington uneasy.
    The article points out that the resignation of the Mendès France government shows another failure of American policy. It is obvious that no conspiracy or trickery can save the policies of those groups in France that are currying favor with American financial groups.
    The article says that the future of France depends mainly on whether the French ruling groups recognize how important it is for France to guarantee collective security in Europe and to establish a unified, peace-loving, and democratic Germany. The task of French foreign policy is not to seek some "convenient" or "appropriate" form of reviving German militarism, but to prevent the establishment of a dangerous hotbed of aggression in West Germany.

### “真理报”“观察家”指出  孟戴斯—弗朗斯倒台表明美国政策的失败

    “真理报”“观察家”指出
    孟戴斯—弗朗斯倒台表明美国政策的失败
    【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科六日讯：“真理报”发表“观察家”的文章，评论法国孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府的辞职。
    文章指出，孟戴斯—弗朗斯上台的时候，正是法国统治集团在印度支那和欧洲的政策遭到谴责、法国舆论要求采取符合民族利益的政策的时候。孟戴斯—弗朗斯在舆论压力下答应结束印度支那的殖民战争。但是，他前进了一步以后，接着却在亚洲和欧洲政策问题上后退了两步。
    法国签署了建立东南亚侵略集团的条约，美国侵略集团成立这一集团是希望使日内瓦会议的积极结果化为乌有。
    在欧洲政策方面，孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府在国民议会拒绝“欧洲军”计划以后，就用尽一切力量使议会赶快批准复活西德军国主义的新协定。在这方面，美国统治集团寄以很大的希望，他们以为这个曾在日内瓦会议上表现了有根据法国民族利益行事的愿望的政府，会比较容易地使西德重新军国主义化的计划在议会中获得通过。
    文章接着说，但是这个阴谋破产了。法国全国展开了反对巴黎协定的强大的人民运动。在议会里，支持政府的多数不断地减少。在巴黎协定勉强通过时，孟戴斯—弗朗斯用尽了诡计也只是取得二十七票的多数。
    文章说，孟戴斯—弗朗斯的美国支持者们后来对他所抱的唯一希望是他可能用各种办法使巴黎协定得到国民议会和共和国参议院的批准。合众社报道指出，鉴于孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府的垮台，华盛顿感到很遗憾，因为“批准（巴黎协定）的时间表”已经不肯定了。这使华盛顿感到不安。
    文章指出，孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府的辞职表明美国政策遭到又一次的失败。很明显，任何阴谋诡计都不能挽救法国的那些向美国财阀讨好的集团的政策。
    文章说，法国的前途主要取决于法国统治集团是否认识到保证欧洲的集体安全和建立统一的、爱好和平的民主的德国对法国是如何重要。法国外交政策的任务不是去寻求复活德国军国主义的某种
  “方便的”或“适宜的”形式，而是要防止在西德建立危险的侵略温床。
