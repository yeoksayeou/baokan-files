Xinhua News Agency, February 4th, London Dispatch: Indian Prime Minister Nehru has expressed his views on the Taiwan issue at the closed-door Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference for several days. According to a United Press International dispatch from London on the 1st, quoting "an authoritative source at the conference," Nehru delivered a lengthy speech at the January 31st meeting, emphasizing that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. Agence France-Presse also quoted "a well-informed source" in a dispatch from London on the 1st as saying that Nehru also said: Taiwan should be returned to Beijing, and it is wrong to think that returning Taiwan to Beijing can be prevented.

Agence France-Presse later reported on Nehru's speech at the 2nd meeting, based on revelations from Australian sources and other parties. Agence France-Presse said that Nehru called on the Commonwealth Prime Ministers to support the proposal to admit the People's Republic of China into the United Nations. Nehru then pointed out: Taiwan is Chinese territory and should be returned to the government of the People's Republic of China, just as the People's Republic of China should obtain its seat on the United Nations Security Council. He said: "If we think we can prevent Taiwan from returning to China, we are deceiving ourselves."

The Agence France-Presse report also said: Nehru finally requested a world conference with the participation of Eastern and Western countries, similar to the Geneva Conference where an agreement was reached on the Indochina issue.

Drake McHugh, a commentator for the London "Daily Express," pointed out that during the discussion of the Taiwan issue at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, a division occurred between the Asian countries in the Commonwealth and other countries. McHugh said: "As I understand it, the crux of this division is that Indian Prime Minister Nehru strongly advocates that Red China has the legal right to occupy Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. To some extent, Ceylon Prime Minister Kotelawala supports Nehru on this issue."

The political commentator of the "Daily Telegraph and Morning Post" also believed that there were serious differences on the Taiwan issue. He pointed out that Australian Prime Minister Menzies differed from the representatives of Asian countries, and he "unambiguously stated that his government supports the US position."

Xinhua News Agency, February 4th, London Dispatch: The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference discussed the issue of atomic energy, especially the issue of atomic weapons, at the morning meeting on the 2nd.

According to various news agencies, Indian Prime Minister Nehru spoke at the meeting. He believed that the atomic arms race was full of serious dangers, and emphasized that politicians all over the world should strive for a complete ban on atomic and hydrogen weapons. He said: Atomic and hydrogen weapons should be banned, and no more tests of these weapons should be carried out. He called on the Prime Ministers of the Commonwealth countries to support a proposal to stop hydrogen bomb tests, which would be submitted to the United Nations Disarmament Subcommittee.

Reuters pointed out that Nehru's speech reflected the widespread opinion in Asia.

British Prime Minister Churchill defended the continued development of atomic weapons in a forty-minute speech, insisting that only through such armament "is it possible for the world's two major blocs to reach a lasting understanding."

According to Reuters, the meeting only spent about thirty minutes discussing the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    尼赫鲁在英联邦总理会议上发表意见
    强调指出台湾是中国不可分割的一部分
    并主张完全禁止原子武器和氢武器
   【新华社四日讯】伦敦消息：印度总理尼赫鲁连日在不公开的英联邦总理会议上就台湾问题发表意见。据合众社一日从伦敦发出的消息引用“一位会议权威人士”的话说，尼赫鲁在一月三十一日的会议上发表长篇演说，强调指出，台湾是中国不可分割的一部分。法新社一日从伦敦发出的消息中也引用“一位消息灵通的人士”说，尼赫鲁还说：台湾应该归还北京，如果认为可以制止把台湾归还北京那就错了。
    法新社以后又根据澳大利亚人士和其他方面的透露，报道了尼赫鲁在二日会议上的发言。法新社说，尼赫鲁要求英联邦各国总理支持关于接纳中华人民共和国进入联合国的建议。尼赫鲁随即指出：台湾是中国的领土，应该归还中华人民共和国政府，正像中华人民共和国应该在联合国安全理事会取得自己的席位一样。他说：“如果认为我们可以阻止台湾归还中国，就等于是自己骗自己。”
    法新社的消息还说：尼赫鲁最后要求召开一次有东西方国家参加的、类似在印度支那问题上达成了协议的日内瓦会议那样的世界会议。
    伦敦“每日快报”评论员德雷克·麦克斯指出，英联邦总理会议在讨论台湾问题时，联邦中的亚洲国家同其他国家发生了分歧。麦克斯说：“据我理解，这种分歧的症结是：印度总理尼赫鲁力主红色中国有占有台湾和澎湖列岛的法律上的权利。对于这个问题，锡兰总理科特拉瓦拉在某种程度上支持尼赫鲁。”
    “每日电讯与晨邮报”的政治评论员也认为在台湾问题上有严重的分歧。他指出：澳大利亚总理孟席斯和亚洲国家的代表不同，他“毫不含糊地表示他的政府是支持美国的立场的”。
   【新华社四日讯】伦敦消息：英联邦总理会议二日上午会议讨论了原子能问题，特别是原子武器问题。
    据各通讯社报道印度总理尼赫鲁在会上发了言。他认为原子武器竞赛充满了严重的危险，并且强调全世界的政治家应当为完全禁止原子武器和氢武器而努力。他说：应当禁止原子武器和氢武器，不应当再进行这些武器的爆炸试验。他要求英联邦各国的总理支持一个要求停止氢弹试验的建议，这个建议将提交联合国裁军小组委员会。
    路透社指出：尼赫鲁的发言反映了亚洲的广泛意见。
    英国首相邱吉尔在长达四十分钟的发言中为继续进行原子武装辩护，硬说只有进行这样的武装，“世界两大集团才有可能取得持久的谅解”。
    据路透社说：会议只用了约三十分钟的时间来讨论和平使用原子能问题。
