    Kailuan Coal Mine's Cost Plan for This Year Is Conservative
    Su Qun
    In July 1954, the Kailuan Coal Mine General Management Office (hereinafter referred to as Kailuan Coal Mine) submitted a proposed figure for the 1955 completion plan to the Coal Mine Management Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry (hereinafter referred to as the General Bureau). This proposed figure was 7.43% higher than the estimated cost for 1954, meaning that the proposed total cost for Kailuan Coal Mine in 1955 would be 58.7 billion yuan higher than in 1954, and the unit cost per ton of raw coal would be 9,039 yuan higher. In October, the General Bureau issued targets to Kailuan Coal Mine, with a reduction rate of 9.63% and a reduction amount of 76.5 billion yuan. In December, the draft plan submitted by Kailuan Coal Mine to the General Bureau not only failed to reduce according to the General Bureau's targets, but also increased by 5.13% compared to the 1954 budget cost, with a total increase of 38.7 billion yuan, a difference of 115.2 billion yuan from the targets. After repeated review by the review team jointly formed by the Ministry of Fuel Industry and the General Bureau, Kailuan Coal Mine partially accepted the review team's opinions, with a reduction rate of 6.02% in the revised plan and a reduction amount of 47.1 billion yuan, still 29.4 billion yuan short of the original targets and 9.9 billion yuan short of the revised targets of 57 billion yuan agreed upon by the Ministry of Fuel Industry and the General Bureau.
    In the process of compiling and reviewing the 1955 cost plan, the attitude of Kailuan Coal Mine, from leading comrades to planning staff, was not serious enough. This can be confirmed by the following facts.
    First, before compiling the plan, enterprises were required to propose practical and feasible proposed figures for the next year, based on the implementation of their plans for the current year and the direction of their future work, for the reference of higher-level leading organs in issuing the plan targets for the next year. This working method is entirely correct. However, when Kailuan Coal Mine submitted the proposed figures, they were inconsistent with the work situation in the first half of 1954, and they did not consider the various possibilities for improving work in 1955, so the proposed figures were even higher than the estimated cost for 1954. This means that they planned to complete and overfulfill the plan more easily in 1955 than in 1954 without making much effort, and that the waste phenomena that existed in financial cost management in 1954 did not need to be improved in 1955.
    Second, when compiling the draft plan, Kailuan Coal Mine did not consider the state's targets at all. The targets stipulated that the cost of Kailuan Coal Mine in 1955 should be 9.63% lower than in 1954, but the draft plan of Kailuan Coal Mine not only did not decrease but increased by 5.13%. Is it that the targets issued by the General Bureau did not conform to the actual situation of Kailuan Coal Mine? Because the General Bureau does not have a deep enough understanding of the situation of Kailuan Coal Mine, some places may not conform to the actual situation. However, it should also be affirmed that the cost of Kailuan Coal Mine in 1955 must be lower than in 1954, not higher. Now let us look at the implementation of the 1954 plan and the results of the 1955 plan review: the cost plan of Kailuan Coal Mine in 1954 was actually 12.27% lower than in 1953, and the actual cost from January to November was 38.9 billion yuan lower than planned. The estimated annual reduction is 5.49% lower than planned, and 17.09% lower than the actual cost in 1953, and this was achieved even when the output did not meet the planned target. So, what reason does Kailuan Coal Mine have to make the cost in 1955 higher than in 1954? The process of reviewing the plan also shows that the cost in 1955 should be lower than in 1954, not higher. If Kailuan Coal Mine had also considered the plan targets issued by the state when compiling the plan, it should have shown a decrease rather than an increase in the first draft plan.
    Third, is it that the cost of Kailuan Coal Mine in 1955 can only be reduced by 47.1 billion yuan and cannot be reduced any further? It should be affirmed that it can still be reduced further. There is still a lot of potential in the use of pit props, the improvement of coal washing recovery rate, and other aspects, but in the process of reviewing the plan, the comrades of Kailuan Coal Mine did not face up to this potential. Taking the amount of pit prop consumption as an example, Kailuan Coal Mine is higher than other mines. The 1954 estimate was 29.07 cubic meters per thousand tons. The 1955 plan is 26.6 cubic meters per thousand tons, which has been reduced, which is good. Based on the experience that Kailuan Coal Mine had reached 24-23 cubic meters per thousand tons in the 1954 pilot project, the review team proposed that Kailuan Coal Mine should reduce it to 25.5 cubic meters per thousand tons, which is achievable. In addition, in the use of pit props, some mining areas have used firewood (note) to replace some pit props in 1954, which can not only reduce costs but also save the country's timber resources. The team proposed that if 15% of the pit props used throughout the year by Kailuan Coal Mine were replaced with firewood, the cost could be reduced by 2 billion yuan. In this way, more than 10 billion yuan could be reduced on the pit prop issue alone. The comrades of Kailuan Coal Mine did not consider these opinions when revising the plan.
    Fourth, Kailuan Coal Mine's attitude towards the review work of higher-level organs is also not honest enough. They adopted a method of evasion and delay, and sometimes even adopted a confrontational attitude on individual issues. For example, the review team pointed out that Kailuan Coal Mine's planned consumption of armored cables and rubber cables was too high and should be appropriately reduced. The comrades of Kailuan Coal Mine not only did not reduce it, but also added 5,000 meters of armored cables and 6,000 meters of rubber cables based on the original draft plan. They ignored the state plan targets and the opinions put forward by the review team approved by the Minister and Bureau Director.
    Why did this phenomenon occur in this work of Kailuan Coal Mine? This is because conservatism is at work. We ask the comrades of Kailuan Coal Mine to calmly examine their thinking on managing industrial enterprises. In this regard, Premier Zhou's words in the government work report at the First National People's Congress are worth reviewing. It is hoped that the comrades of Kailuan Coal Mine will seriously examine their thinking and work in accordance with the spirit of Premier Zhou's report. It should also be pointed out in passing that Kailuan Coal Mine is not the only unit in the state-owned coal mine system that treats cost plans in this way this year. We hope that the leading comrades of these enterprise departments can also learn from this lesson and check the plans of their own enterprises.
      Note: "Firewood" refers to pit props or wood that do not meet the specifications, and in the past, some were used to burn into charcoal. Since last year, some state-owned coal mines have been using it to replace some good pit props under the condition of ensuring safety.

    开滦煤矿今年的成本计划很保守
    苏群
    一九五四年七月，开滦煤矿总管理处（以下简称开滦煤矿）向燃料工业部煤矿管理总局（以下简称总局）提出了一九五五年完成计划的建议数字。这一建议数字比一九五四年的预计成本高百分之七点四三，即建议开滦煤矿一九五五年的总成本比一九五四年增高五八七亿元，每吨原煤单位成本比一九五四年高九千零三九元。十月，总局颁发给开滦煤矿的指标，降低率为百分之九点六三，降低额为七六五亿元。十二月，开滦煤矿送总局的计划草案，不但未按总局指标予以降低，反而比一九五四年预算成本增高百分之五点一三，总额增高了三八七亿元，与指标相差一一五二亿元。经燃料工业部与总局共同组成的审核小组反复审核，开滦煤矿部分的接受小组意见，在修改计划中降低率达百分之六点○二，降低额为四七一亿元，与原指标仍差二九四亿元，与燃料工业部和总局同意后修改的指标五七○亿元，仍差九九亿元。
    开滦煤矿在编制与审核一九五五年成本计划的过程中，从领导同志到计划工作人员，态度都是不够严肃的。从以下事实中，可以得到证实。
    一、编制计划前，要求各企业根据自己本年度计划执行情况及今后工作的努力方向，提出下年度的切实可行的建议数字，供上级领导机关颁发下年度计划指标的参考，这一工作方法是完全正确的。但是开滦煤矿在提建议数字时，却与一九五四年上半年的工作情况不符，也未考虑一九五五年一年中的工作改进的各种可能性，因而提出的建议数字比一九五四年预计成本还高。这也就是说：他们打算一九五五年不作多大努力就可以比一九五四年更容易地完成与超额完成计划，一九五四年财务成本管理存在的一些浪费现象，一九五五年用不着改进。
    二、开滦煤矿在编制计划草案时，根本未考虑国家指标，指标规定：开滦煤矿一九五五年的成本，应比一九五四年降低百分之九点六三，而开滦煤矿的计划草案，不但未降低、反而增高了百分之五点一三，是不是总局编发的指标不符合开滦煤矿的实际情况呢？由于总局对开滦煤矿的情况还了解得不够深入，有些地方可能与实际情况不符。但是，开滦煤矿一九五五年的成本必须比一九五四年降低，而不是提高，这也是应该肯定的。现在我们从一九五四年计划执行的情况和一九五五年计划的审核结果来看吧：一九五四年开滦煤矿的成本计划，比一九五三年实际降低百分之一二点二七，而一至十一月实际比计划又降低了三八九亿元。全年预计比计划降低百分之五点四九，比一九五三年实际降低百分之一七点○九，这还是在产量未完成计划的情况下完成的。那么，开滦煤矿有什么理由使一九五五年的成本比一九五四年还高？审核计划的过程，也说明了一九五五年的成本应比一九五四年降低，而不是提高。如果开滦煤矿在编制计划时，还考虑一下国家颁发的计划指标的话，应该在第一次的计划草案中，就表现降低而不是提高。
    三、是不是开滦煤矿一九五五年的成本，比一九五四年只能降低四七一亿元，不能再多降低了呢？应该肯定，还是可以多降下些的。在坑木使用上，在洗煤回收率的提高上，以及在其他方面，都还存在着不少潜力的，但在审核计划的过程中，开滦煤矿的同志却不正视这些潜力。拿坑木消耗金额来说，开滦煤矿较其他各矿都高。一九五四年预计为千吨二九·○七立方公尺。一九五五年计划为千吨二六·六立方公尺，已有所降低，这是好的。审核小组根据开滦煤矿一九五四年试点已达千吨二四—二三立方公尺的经验，提出开滦煤矿应降低到千吨二五·五立方公尺，这是可以达到的。另外在坑木使用上，有些矿区，一九五四年已使用薪炭材（注）代替部分坑木，不仅能降低成本，且可节约国家木材的资源。小组提出开滦煤矿如全年所用的坑木，百分之十五以薪炭材来代替，则可降低成本二○亿元。这样在坑木问题上即可再降低一百亿元以上。开滦煤矿的同志对这些意见，修改计划时未予考虑。
    四、开滦煤矿在对待上级机关的审核工作的态度上也是不够老实的。他们是采取推托和延宕的办法，有时在个别问题上甚至采取对抗的态度。例如，审核小组提出开滦煤矿的铠装电缆和胶皮电缆，计划消耗量过多，应适当地削减，开滦煤矿的同志不但未削减，反而在原计划草案的基础上，追加铠装电缆五千公尺，胶皮电缆六千公尺。他们对国家计划指标和经部长局长批准了的审核小组提出的意见，置之不理。
    为什么开滦煤矿在这一工作上，会产生这种现象的呢？这就是保守思想在作怪。我们请开滦煤矿的同志，冷静地检查一下管理工业企业的思想。这方面，周总理在全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的政府工作报告中的话，是值得我们温习一下的。希望开滦煤矿的同志，根据周总理的报告精神，来认真检查一下思想和工作。也要顺便指出：像这样对待成本计划的单位，今年在国营煤矿系统中不是开滦煤矿一个，我们希望这些企业部门的领导同志也能从中吸取教训，检查一下本企业的计划。
      注：“薪炭材”是指不合乎规格的坑木或木材，
    过去有的用来烧成木炭。国营煤矿从去年起有部分矿在保证安全的条件下，利用它代替部分好坑木。
