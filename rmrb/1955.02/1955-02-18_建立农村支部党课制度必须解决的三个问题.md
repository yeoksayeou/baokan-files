Establishing a rural branch regular education system is an important method for improving the class consciousness of rural party members and consolidating rural party organizations. However, there is not much experience in this area yet. Therefore, the experience summarized by the Propaganda Department of the Central China South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Propaganda Department of the Guangxi Provincial Committee of the CPC is worth paying attention to.

Editor's Note: Not long ago, the Central China South Bureau of the CPC Central Committee convened a symposium on rural branch education in Guangdong Province to summarize the experience of carrying out regular education in rural branches. Based on the experience of various places, everyone unanimously believed that establishing a party class system is the central link to regularizing rural branch education, and to ensure that the party class system can be adhered to and effective, three issues must be resolved:

First, the issue of Party committees' attention and specific guidance from propaganda departments: Experience in various places has proven that regular branch education is carried out better in places where the county Party committee, especially the district Party committee, attaches importance to this work. Whether the county and district Party committees attach importance to regular branch education depends first on whether the county and district Party committees have solved the problem of regularly relying on the branch from an ideological and practical perspective. Only by regularly relying on the branch can we feel the need to continuously improve the branch and the need for regular branch education. The party class system is a major component of regular branch education. To establish a party class system, we must first correct the doubts of some county and district Party committees about the party class system: such as whether it will hinder the central work, how effective it will be, and whether it can be sustained, etc. We must make the Party committee realize that regularly conducting Marxist-Leninist education for party members is one of its important work contents, and closely integrate this education with the party's practical work, especially the central work in rural areas in each period, so that the branch's regular education work becomes an integral part of the entire Party's regular work and becomes a work that all party members and cadres are concerned about and implement. However, experience in various places has proven that it is not enough for the Party committee to attach importance; the specific guidance of the Party's propaganda department is also an indispensable condition for carrying out regular branch education. The Party's propaganda departments should mainly focus on three things: first, grasp typical examples, go deep into the branches to create and summarize typical experiences, and promote and guide the regular education of the branches; second, grasp planning, formulate branch education plans based on the actual work tasks of each period, and assist the Party committee in implementing them; third, grasp teaching, organize the branch education team, help branch instructors solve teaching difficulties, gradually improve teaching quality, and compile and review teaching materials.

Second, the issue of integrating the party class system with the central work in rural areas in various periods: Everyone believes that two incorrect understandings must be criticized. One is that regular branch education should be "learn what you do," believing that rural branch education should only take the education of the work tasks in each period of the rural areas as the main content at any time. The education of the Party's principles and policies and the basic knowledge of the Party can only be carried out through the education of the central work. It is even believed that work is education, and the work process is the education process. This view actually denies the necessity of the Party conducting systematic education of basic Party knowledge for rural party members, which will naturally weaken the content of regular branch education. The other is that regular branch education should focus on the basic knowledge of the Party in order to fundamentally improve the political awareness and ideological level of party members, thereby promoting the Party's work in various periods; and education combined with the central work cannot be regarded as the Party's education, that is, the education of the party class. This view abstracts the meaning of party class education, narrows its scope, and makes party class education isolated from the central work, which is not conducive to the development of regular branch education. The above two views, equating or opposing the regular education of the branch with the Party's actual work, are one-sided and incorrect. Everyone believes that the content of regular branch education should mainly include: education on the Party's general line; education on the Party's various policies in rural areas (centered on the mutual aid and cooperation policy); and education on the basic knowledge of the Party—communism and the Communist Party. These educational contents can be closely integrated with the current central work (such as combining the mutual aid and cooperation movement to conduct education on the general line and mutual aid and cooperation policies, combining the unified grain purchase work to conduct education on the unified purchase and sale policies and the socialist transformation of agriculture; combining conscription work to conduct education on conscription laws and patriotism, etc.), and at the same time, the education of basic Party knowledge can be carried out in a concentrated and systematic way by taking advantage of slack farming seasons and gaps in movements. Only in this way can the regular education of the branch be more closely integrated with the various central work in rural areas, and fundamentally improve the political awareness and ideological level of party members. The main form of conducting this kind of education is the party class system. Places that have established and adhered to the party class system have proven that it is an effective way to improve the thinking of party members, and party members welcome it. Party class education is mainly based on lectures, supplemented by discussions that relate to reality. However, the form of party class education should also be closely coordinated with the education of work meetings and the education of Party life (criticism and self-criticism) to achieve more practical results. In addition, short-term concentrated learning for party members, that is, the method of rotation training, should also be arranged in a planned manner and gradually made into a system.

Third, the issue of cultivating and managing branch instructors and branch teaching materials: Everyone believes that the current method of solving the problem of branch instructors should still be mainly based on district Party committee members and county and district Party cadres serving concurrently. It is still difficult for rural branch party members to serve as instructors, but attention should be paid to selecting rural party members with better conditions to participate in teaching research and serve as learning tutors, and gradually cultivate the branch's own instructors. Regarding helping instructors improve teaching quality and the management of instructors, everyone affirmed two systems, namely the lesson preparation system and the card system. The lesson preparation meeting should prepare a unified outline or lecture notes in advance, and the collective should discuss, supplement, and revise them at the meeting, which is a practical way to ensure teaching quality. Establishing a card system to regularly understand the teaching situation and promptly correct the shortcomings in teaching is also an effective way to improve the quality of instructors. Everyone believes that branch instructors are the basic team for regular branch education. Only by continuously improving the teaching quality of instructors can the branch education—the party class system—be more sound and consolidated. Therefore, allocating a certain number of instructors and practically helping instructors solve specific teaching difficulties has become an important responsibility of the Party committee.

    建立农村支部党课制度必须解决的三个问题
    中共中央华南分局宣传部
　　编者按：建立农村支部经常教育的制度，是提高农村党员的阶级觉悟和巩固农村党组织的重要方法，但目前这一方面的经验还不多，因此，中共中央华南分局宣传部和中共广西省委宣传部总结的经验是值得重视的。
    不久之前，中共中央华南分局召开了广东地区的农村支部教育工作座谈会，总结了开展农村支部经常教育的经验。根据各地经验，大家一致认为，建立党课制度是使农村支部教育经常化的中心一环，而要使党课制度能够坚持并且收效就要解决三个问题：
    一、党委重视和宣传部门具体指导的问题：各地经验证明，凡是支部经常教育开展较好的地方，都是和县委，尤其是区委对这一工作的重视分不开的。而县、区委是否重视支部经常教育，首先又在于县区委是否从思想认识上和实际工作中解决了经常依靠支部的问题。只有经常依靠支部，才能感到不断提高支部的必要，也才能感到支部经常教育的必要。而党课制度是支部经常教育的一个主要内容，要建立党课制度，首先就要纠正有些县区委对党课制度的怀疑：如是否妨碍中心工作，会有多大效果，能否坚持下去等等。要使党委认识，经常对党员进行马克思列宁主义教育是它的重要的工作内容之一，并把这种教育和党的实际工作，特别是每一时期农村的中心工作密切地结合起来，使支部的经常教育工作成为整个党的经常工作的组成部分，成为全体党员干部所关心和实行的工作。但是各地经验证明，仅有党委重视还不够，党的宣传部门的具体指导也是开展支部经常教育必不可少的条件。党委宣传部门主要应抓三件事：一是抓典型，深入支部创造和总结典型经验，推广和指导支部的经常教育；二是抓计划，根据每个时期实际工作任务制定支部教育计划，协助党委加以贯彻；三是抓教学，组织支部教育的队伍，帮助支部教员解决教学困难并逐步提高教学质量，编制和审查教材。
    二、党课制度和农村各个时期中心工作结合的问题：大家认为必须批判两种不正确的认识，一种是认为支部经常教育应该是“做什么学什么”，认为农村支部教育任何时候都只能以农村中每一时期的工作任务的教育作为主要内容。党的原则政策和党的基本知识的教育只能通过中心工作的教育来进行。甚至认为工作就是教育，工作过程就是教育过程。这种见解实际上是否认党对农村党员进行系统的党的基本知识教育的必要，这自然会削弱支部经常教育的内容。另一种是认为支部经常教育应以党的基本知识为主要内容。以便从根本上提高党员的政治觉悟和思想水平，从而推动各个时期党的工作；而结合中心工作进行的教育是不能算作党的教育即党课的教育的。这种见解把党课教育的涵义抽象化了，范围缩小了，并且使党课教育脱离了中心工作孤立地进行，这是不利于支部经常教育的开展的。以上两种看法，把支部的经常教育和党的实际工作等同起来或者对立起来都是片面的，不正确的。大家认为支部经常教育的内容目前主要应该包括：党的总路线的教育；党在农村中各项政策（以互助合作政策为中心）的教育及党的基本知识——共产主义和共产党的教育。这些教育内容，可以密切结合当前中心工作来进行，（如结合互助合作运动进行总路线和互助合作政策的教育、结合粮食统购工作进行统购统销政策和农业社会主义改造的教育；结合征兵工作进行征兵法令和爱国主义的教育等）同时也可以利用农闲和运动的空隙集中地系统地进行党的基本知识的教育。只有这样，才能使得支部的经常教育更能结合农村各项中心工作，又能从根本上提高党员的政治觉悟和思想水平。而进行这种教育的主要形式是党课制度，凡是建立和坚持了党课制度的地方，证明它对提高党员思想是一种有效的办法，党员是欢迎的。党课教育是以讲解为主、辅以联系实际的讨论。但党课教育形式也要和工作会议的教育、党的生活（批评和自我批评）的教育等形式密切配合，才能收到更实际的效果。此外，党员短期集中的学习，即轮流训练的方式，也应有计划地加以安排，并逐步使之形成制度。
    三、支部教员的培养和管理以及支部教材的问题：大家认为目前解决支部教员的办法仍应以区委及县区党员干部兼任为主，农村支部党员担任教员尚有困难，但应注意挑选条件较好的农村党员参加教学研究和担任学习辅导工作，逐步培养支部自己的教员。关于帮助教员提高教学质量和教员管理工作，大家肯定了两种制度，即备课制度和卡片制度。备课会议应事先准备好统一的提纲或讲稿，会上集体加以讨论，补充修改，这是保证教学质量的切实办法。建立卡片制度，经常了解教学情况，及时改正教学中的缺点，也是提高教员质量的有效办法。大家认为支部教员是支部经常教育的基本队伍，只有不断提高教员的教学质量，才能使支部教育——党课制度更加健全和巩固。因此，配置一定数量的教员，切实帮助教员解决教学的具体困难，就成了党委的重要责任。
