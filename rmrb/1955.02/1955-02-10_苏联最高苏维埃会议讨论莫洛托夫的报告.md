Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 9th: According to TASS, the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union held a joint session on the morning of February 9th and began discussing the report by V.M. Molotov, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, on the international situation and the foreign policy of the Soviet government.

The deputies who spoke at the meeting considered that the policy of the Soviet government was correct, that it was in line with the cause of peace, and that it embodied the vital interests and will of all the Soviet people.

A.M. Puzanov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian Federation, said that the Soviet Union was unswervingly engaged in the struggle for peace and the relaxation of international tensions. In contrast to the American policy aimed at splitting Europe and establishing aggressive military blocs, the Soviet Union advocates the establishment of a European collective security system. This policy has been warmly supported by all the people of the Soviet Union. Puzanov said that reality shows to all well-meaning people that to defend peace in Europe it is necessary to unite the forces of all European countries, regardless of their social and state systems.

N.V. Popova, Secretary of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, expressed support for the Soviet government's peaceful foreign policy in the name of Soviet women. She emphasized the great significance of the World Peace Council's appeal to the people of the world on the prohibition of atomic weapons.

The meeting is continuing.
