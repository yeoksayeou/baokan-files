The first class of 1,671 students from the Correspondence Specialist Program of Renmin University of China have graduated. On February 6th, a graduation ceremony was held for 700 graduates from ten specialized classes including Industrial Economics and Trade Economics at the Beijing Correspondence Teaching Guidance Station. At the meeting, President Wu Yuzhang and Vice President Nie Zhen encouraged the correspondence graduates to continue their studies based on their existing self-study habits and to do their jobs well.

The correspondence students at the Beijing Correspondence Teaching Guidance Station are all working cadres from central and Beijing municipal level government agencies, factories, and mines, of whom 16% are cadres at the section chief level or above. Despite their busy work schedules, the correspondence students persisted in attending classes once or twice a week and completing one course assignment every two to three weeks. Their exam scores have been rising year by year. Over the past two years, 72 people have consistently achieved excellent grades in all subjects. (According to Xinhua News Agency)
