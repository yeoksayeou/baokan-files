    More than ninety programs featuring national styles and local folk songs and dances were performed at the event. The folk song "The Sun Rises on the Grassland" sung by Wang Bingrui of the Hui Nationality Academy, and the Sani folk song "Guests from Afar, Please Stay" performed by the song and dance troupe of the Middle School Affiliated to the Central University for Nationalities, were both well received. The cotton dance performed by Turson Nai from Beijing Medical College and the Kazakh labor dance performed by Situ Shuang from Beijing Foreign Languages ​​Institute, with their distinct rhythms and delicate movements, expressed the theme of ethnic minorities loving labor and praising their happy lives. Students from Renmin University of China and Peking University performed the beautiful and moving "Goose Dance" and the Huangmei Opera "Husband and Wife Watching Lanterns."

    Programs created by the students themselves were particularly popular. The youth group of the Beijing No. 8 Girls' Middle School dance troupe performed "Clapping Dance". Yu Dacheng, a student from Beijing No. 21 Middle School, played three pieces on the piano that he composed himself: "Dusk on Campus" and "Sparrow Dance," among others.
