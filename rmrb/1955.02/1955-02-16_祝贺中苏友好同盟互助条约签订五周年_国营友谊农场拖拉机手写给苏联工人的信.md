    Congratulations on the Fifth Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance
    Letter from Tractor Drivers of the State-Run Friendship Farm to Soviet Workers
    Dear Comrades, Workers of the Kirov Tractor Factory and the Kharkov Tractor Factory:

    We, the tractor drivers of the State-Run Friendship Farm of the People's Republic of China, extend our congratulations to you on the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, and thank you—the people of the Soviet Union—for sending us agricultural machines such as tractors.

    Dear Comrades: In these past few years, whenever we talk about the Soviet people, everyone's heart is filled with unspeakable respect, and we feel an infinite surge of strength. We have personally witnessed how the Soviet people have helped our country quickly restore its economy, which was destroyed by the war, and have also helped us begin our first great Five-Year Construction Plan. We have personally watched one large factory after another, one large mine after another, being built with the help of the Soviet people, and one railway line after another being gradually completed with the help of the Soviet people. And this farm where we are all working now was also built with machines and equipment sent by you, the Soviet people, and with the help of your outstanding sons and daughters—Soviet experts. Dear Comrades! How can we not thank you?

    We especially want to thank you who manufactured these tractors. A month ago, when these machines first arrived, we got up in the middle of the night upon hearing the news and rushed to the station to welcome them. Now, when we sit in the driver's seat and start them up, how happy we are! In the past, the "DT-54" tractor's cab had no doors or windows, and we had to endure the rain and cold when the wind and rain came; the starter had no muffler, which made our ears ring uncomfortably. Now, the machines you sent us have doors and windows, and mufflers have been installed. Dear Comrades: How grateful we are for the happiness that your creative labor has brought us!

    Dear Comrades: In another month or so, the work of land reclamation and sowing will begin here. At that time, we will sit on the tractors you manufactured to cultivate this land. Comrades: We assure you that we will cherish these machines, which you have meticulously manufactured, as we cherish our own eyes, and humbly learn from Soviet experts to complete the tasks assigned to us by the motherland.

    We wish you even greater victories in your work!

    The Entirety of the Tractor Drivers of the State-Run Friendship Farm of the People's Republic of China

    祝贺中苏友好同盟互助条约签订五周年
    国营友谊农场拖拉机手写给苏联工人的信亲爱的基洛夫拖拉机制造厂和哈尔科夫拖拉机制造厂的工人同志们：我们——中华人民共和国国营友谊农场的拖拉机手们，在这中苏友好同盟互助条约签订五周年的时候，特向你们祝贺，并感谢你们——苏联的人民送给我们以拖拉机等农业机器。
    亲爱的同志们：这几年，当我们一谈到苏联人民的时候，每个人的心中就都会有着说不出的敬意，并感到身上增加了无限的力量。我们亲眼看到：苏联人民帮助我国很快地恢复了被战争所破坏的经济，并且又帮助我们开始了第一个巨大的五年建设计划。我们亲眼看着一座又一座的大工厂、大矿山在苏联人民的帮助下建立起来，一条又一条的铁路在苏联人民的帮助下逐步修通。而现在我们大家在这里工作着的这个农场，又是你们苏联人民送来了机器和设备，并派出自己优秀的儿女——苏联专家来帮助我们建设的。亲爱的同志们！我们怎么能不感谢你们呢。
    我们特别要感谢制造这些拖拉机的你们。一个月以前，当这些机器初来到的时候，我们半夜里听到消息就马上起床跑到车站去欢迎它们。现在，当我们坐在驾驶台上开动它的时候，我们又是多么高兴呵！过去，“德特五十四”拖拉机的坐棚上没有门和玻璃窗，遇上个刮风下雨天，就得受淋挨冻；起动机上没有消音器，把人耳朵震的挺难受的。现在你们送给我们的这些机器，门窗都有了，又安装了消音器。亲爱的同志们：我们是多么感激你们的这种创造性的劳动所带给我们的幸福呵！
    亲爱的同志们：再过一个月光景，在我们这里，开荒和播种的工作就要开始了。那时候，我们就要坐上你们所制造的拖拉机来开垦这里的土地了。同志们：我们向你们保证，我们一定要像爱护自己的眼睛那样来爱护你们精心制造出来的这些机器，并虚心向苏联专家学习，来完成祖国所交给我们的任务。
    祝你们在工作中取得更大的胜利！中华人民共和国国营友谊农场全体拖拉机手
