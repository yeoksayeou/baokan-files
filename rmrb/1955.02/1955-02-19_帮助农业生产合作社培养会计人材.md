Helping the existing and the hundreds of thousands of agricultural production cooperatives that are being established to cultivate accounting personnel and to do a good job in financial management is a prominent task in the current agricultural cooperation movement. The financial accounting work is lagging behind the large-scale development of agricultural production cooperatives, which has become a weak link in the current agricultural cooperation movement. Many cooperatives have unclear accounts, which affects the smooth progress of production and distribution. According to reports from some areas, about 30 to 40 percent of the old cooperatives have not yet completely settled their accounts from last year. Some cooperatives' accounts are very chaotic, and the enthusiasm of the members is low, and they even demand to withdraw from the cooperative. In Linshu County, Shandong Province, thirteen cooperatives could not settle their accounts, and forty-seven households have demanded to withdraw from the cooperative. In some culturally backward areas with a large number of cooperatives, it is even more difficult to find suitable accountants. Enshi County, Hubei Province, originally planned to establish four cooperatives in Wufeng Township, but because only one accountant could be found, only one cooperative could be established. This situation will inevitably become more prominent and serious as the number of agricultural production cooperatives increases significantly. Therefore, leading organs at all levels must fully recognize the seriousness of this issue and actively take effective measures to solve it.

Solving this problem must be approached from three aspects: First, compile concise and practical accounting textbooks; second, train accounting personnel of agricultural production cooperatives in a planned way; and third, strengthen regular financial accounting guidance work. The Ministry of Agriculture and agricultural departments in some provinces have already compiled some accounting textbooks; various regions have trained a large number of accountants; many new cooperatives have established formal books and established necessary financial accounting systems; many agricultural and forestry departments and agricultural technology extension stations have set up accounting advisors and have guided and organized a number of agricultural production cooperative accountant mutual aid groups, summarizing and exchanging some experiences in financial accounting work.

In the rapidly developing situation of the agricultural cooperation movement, these achievements in training accounting personnel are far from meeting the actual needs. Some areas have not yet started the work of training agricultural production cooperative accountants. Some areas run accounting training classes, but only assign two or three counselors to do the work, and leading cadres rarely pay attention to and inspect them, so that there are many problems in the management and teaching of the training classes, which seriously reduces the training effect. Some training classes teach a lot of content within three or four days, and some training classes blindly use more complex accounting textbook materials, so that most accountants cannot accept them. After the training, the guidance work in most areas has not kept up in time, and the accountants who have been trained still cannot establish accounts. In addition, the composition of accountants in some cooperatives is not pure, and landlords, rich peasants, and other hostile elements have mixed in, playing a destructive role in the cooperative, which requires serious vigilance.

Why do these problems occur? The main reason is that some rural work cadres, and even some leading cadres, do not sufficiently recognize the importance of cultivating accounting personnel for agricultural production cooperatives. Some comrades believe that the accounting work of cooperatives is a technical issue, not a policy issue; or they believe that as long as production is done well, the quality of accounting work is unimportant. Indeed, the specific processing methods of accounting matters are technical issues. However, if the accounting work is not done well, and serious confusion occurs, affecting production and reducing the income of members, it will ultimately hinder the consolidation and development of the cooperative, which becomes a political issue. It is impossible to imagine that in a situation where the financial accounting work of agricultural production cooperatives is very chaotic, production plans can be well completed, production funds can be correctly used, production income can be reasonably distributed, public property can be accumulated in a planned way, and various policies related to cooperation can be smoothly implemented. Some cooperatives have chaotic accounts and unfair distribution, and the members reflect: "The accounts are a pot of porridge, the more you calculate, the more confused you become; if the grain accounts are not clear, who will be motivated to work hard?" Is this not an example of how poor financial accounting work affects the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives? On the contrary, many cooperatives have clear accounts, and the members are very motivated to work, and they say: "As long as we don't eat confused meals, we are willing to work hard no matter how tired we are!" Is this not a concrete reflection of the broad masses of members demanding good financial accounting work?

Some cadres generally recognize the importance of financial accounting work, but underestimate the complexity and difficulty of this work. They think that it is enough to assign the financial accounting work to a few full-time cadres, and there is no need for leading cadres to spend more energy; or they think that training accountants to keep accounts is a relatively easy task, and it can be learned in a few days. They do not understand that for farmers, financial accounting work is a completely new task, and the cultural level of general accountants is very low. Without good leadership and help, it is impossible to do it well. There are many aspects to the financial work of cooperatives, and the threads are relatively complex. For example, production expenses, income, distribution, public property, and all economic transactions inside and outside the cooperative, any one of which is not handled well will affect the implementation of policies. These tasks are not easy for general farmer accountants to do without the necessary training and regular guidance. This kind of training and guidance work cannot be done well if it is entrusted to a few full-time cadres without the organization and leadership of responsible cadres at all levels, especially responsible cadres at the county level.

Some cadres do not sufficiently recognize the urgency of training accountants, and excuse themselves by saying "we are busy with work and cannot take care of it," even saying "it doesn't matter if the accounting training work is postponed." They do not understand that after a new cooperative is established, various financial activities will begin immediately; if the accounting training work is postponed too much, it will affect the normal progress of the cooperative's financial accounting work, and even cause chaotic accounts, which will be difficult to clean up in the future. "Many tasks and tight schedules" will be a long-term situation, and there will not be many opportunities to have only a single task at a certain time. Leading organs must be good at organizing and arranging work. As long as the time and resources are well allocated, several tasks can be carried out simultaneously.

Efforts must be made to make up for the shortcomings in this area of work so that financial accounting work can adapt to the needs of the cooperation movement. Areas that have not yet started training new cooperative accountants should seize the time, organize forces, and start immediately to provide basic training to all accountants of agricultural cooperatives once; and it is necessary to ensure the quality of training and not be careless. Those who have been trained but some have not yet learned should find ways to provide supplementary training once. Those whose composition of accountants is impure should be replaced and purged according to the specific situation.

In the future, agricultural production cooperatives will adopt the method of year-round preparation and batch development, and accounting training work should also adopt the method of year-round preparation and batch training. The provincial-level agricultural departments should start now to study the situation of accounting reserve personnel in their respective regions, formulate longer-term training plans, and hold some longer-term training classes to prepare for the establishment and expansion of cooperatives in the next few years. In order to solve the current difficulty of lacking teachers in accounting training classes, each province can plan to set up longer-term training classes to train accounting teachers and counselors from special districts and counties in rotation.

After the accountants have completed their training, the guidance work should closely follow up. The accounting training classes currently held are mostly crash courses, short in time and heavy in curriculum, and some students have difficulty learning completely; some students, although they have learned bookkeeping methods in the training class, will still encounter some complex problems in their actual work that cannot be solved. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen regular guidance work to consolidate the achievements of training and supplement the shortcomings of training. The current focus of guidance is to quickly solve the problems of establishing accounts for new cooperatives and closing accounts for old cooperatives, and on the basis of doing a good job in settlement and establishing accounts, formulate necessary financial accounting systems and financial revenue and expenditure plans. In order to do this work well, first of all, the existing guidance forces must be organized. The full-time counselors who have been assigned to each county and district should be strengthened in leadership so that they can give full play to their role; areas where counselors have not been fully staffed should be quickly staffed. In addition, cadres from banks, supply and marketing cooperatives, and other departments who are familiar with financial accounting work should also be absorbed to do guidance work concurrently. Mass organizations such as mutual aid cooperation networks and accountant mutual aid groups will play a great role in improving the ideological and professional level of accountants and improving and enhancing the financial management of agricultural production cooperatives. In the future, the leadership of these mass organizations must be strengthened to give full play to their role.

    帮助农业生产合作社培养会计人材
    帮助现有的和正在建立的几十万个农业生产合作社培养会计人材，做好财务管理工作，是当前农业合作化运动中的一项突出的任务。财务会计工作跟不上农业生产合作社的大量发展，成为目前农业合作化运动中的薄弱一环。不少合作社账目不清，影响了生产和分配工作的顺利进行。据若干地区反映：约有百分之三、四十的老社，到现在还没有完全结清去年的老账。有些社的账目十分混乱，社员情绪低落，甚至要求退社。山东临沭县有十三个社结不出账目，其中四十七户已要求退社。在某些文化落后和建社较多的地区，更找不着适当的会计。湖北恩施县五峰乡原计划建立四个社，因为只找到一个会计，结果只能建一个社。这种情况，随着农业生产合作社的大量增加，必然会更加突出和严重。因此，各级领导机关必须充分认识这一问题的严重性，积极采取有效措施加以解决。
    解决这个问题必须从三个方面下手：一、编写简明适用的会计教材，二、有计划地训练农业生产合作社的会计人员，三、加强经常的财务会计辅导工作。现在农业部和有些省的农业部门已经编出了一些会计教材；各地已经训练了大批的会计员；有很多新社已经建立起正式的账簿，并订立了必要的财务会计制度；很多农林部门和农业技术推广站设置了会计辅导员，并指导组织了一批农业生产合作社会计员互助组，总结和交流了财务会计工作方面的一些经验。
    在农业合作运动迅速发展着的形势下，这些培养会计人员的成就，远远不能满足实际的需要。有的地区训练农业生产合作社会计员的工作还没有动手。有些地区开办会计训练班，只是交给二、三个辅导员去作，领导干部很少过问和检查，以致训练班的管理和教课方面存在不少问题，严重地减低了训练效果。有些训练班在三、四天的时间以内教很多内容，有些训练班盲目采用较复杂的账簿教材，以致多数会计员接受不了。训练结束后，多数地区的辅导工作未能及时跟上，受了训的会计员还是建不起账来。还有些社的会计员成份不纯，混入了地主富农和别的敌对分子，在社内起了破坏作用，尤其要严重警惕。
    为什么会发生这样一些问题呢？主要原因是有些农村工作干部，甚至一些领导干部，对于培养农业生产合作社会计人员的重要性认识不足。有些同志认为合作社的会计工作是技术问题，不是政策问题；或者认为只要生产搞好就行了，会计工作好坏无关紧要。诚然，会计账务的具体处理方法，是技术性的问题。但是，如果会计工作搞不好，发生严重的混乱现象，影响了生产，减少了社员的收入，最后是妨碍了社的巩固和发展，这就成为政治问题了。决不可以设想，在农业生产合作社的财务会计工作非常混乱的情况下，生产计划可以很好地完成，生产资金可以正确地运用，生产收益可以合理地分配，公共财产可以有计划地积累，有关合作化的各项政策可以顺利地贯彻。有些合作社账目混乱，分配不公，社员们反映：“账是一锅粥，越算越糊涂；粮食账不算，谁还起劲干。”这不正是因为财务会计工作搞不好而影响了农业合作社的巩固的例证吗？相反，许多合作社由于账目清楚，社员干活很起劲，他们说：“只要不吃糊涂面，再累也情愿！”这难道不是广大社员群众要求搞好财务会计工作的具体反映吗？
    有些干部一般地认识到财务会计工作的重要性，但是对这个工作的复杂性和困难程度估计不足。他们以为把财务会计工作交给几个专职干部去作就够了，用不着领导干部再去花费精力；或者以为训练会计员记账是比较容易的事，几天就可以学会了。他们不了解，对于农民来说，财务会计工作是一件全新的工作，一般会计员的文化水平都很低，没有很好的领导和帮助，是不可能作好的。合作社的财务工作方面很多，头绪也比较复杂，像生产支出、收入、分配、公共财产和社内外一切经济往来等等，那一项账务处理不好，都会影响政策的贯彻。这些工作，对于一般的农民会计员来说，没有必要的训练和经常的辅导，是不容易做好的。这种训练和辅导工作，如果没有各级负责干部，特别是县的负责干部的组织和领导，而推给几个专职干部去做，也是不容易做好的。
    有些干部对于训练会计的紧迫的时间性认识不足，借口“工作忙，顾不上”，竟说“会计训练工作推迟一些没关系”。他们不了解新社成立以后，财务方面的种种活动马上就要开始；如果会计训练工作过于推迟，就会影响合作社财务会计工作的正常进行，甚至会发生账目混乱现象，以至今后不易收拾。“任务多、时间紧”将是长期的状况，在一个时期只有单一任务的机会是不会多的。领导机关必须善于组织和安排工作。只要把时间和力量支配好，几件工作是可以同时进行的。
    必须设法弥补这方面工作的缺点，使财务会计工作能适应合作化运动的需要。还没有动手训练新社会计的地区，应抓紧时间，组织力量，立即动手，把所有农业社的会计员普训一次；并且要保证训练质量，不可草率从事。已经训练但有些人还没有学会的，应设法补训一次。会计员成份不纯的，应分别情况调换、清洗。
    农业生产合作社今后是采取常年准备分批发展的办法，会计训练工作也应该采取常年准备分批训练的办法。省一级农业部门应从现在开始着手研究本地区会计后备人材的情况，制订较长远的训练计划，举办一些比较长期的训练班，为今后几年内的建社和扩大社作好会计员的准备工作。为了解决当前会计训练班缺乏师资的困难，各省可以规划设置较长期的训练班，轮训专区和县的会计教员、辅导员。
    会计员训练完毕之后，辅导工作应该紧紧地跟上去。现在举办的会计训练班多是速成的性质，时间很短，课程很重，有些学员很难完全学会；有些学员虽然在训练班上学会了簿记使用法，但在实际工作中随时还会遇到一些复杂问题不能解决。因此，必须加强经常性的辅导工作，巩固训练的成果并补助训练的不足。当前辅导重点是迅速解决新社的建账和老社的结账问题，在作好结算和建账的基础上，制订必要的财务会计制度和财务收支计划。为了做好这个工作，首先要把现有的辅导力量组织起来。对于各县各区已配备的专职辅导员，应加强领导，使他们充分发挥作用；尚未配齐辅导员的地区，应迅速配齐。此外，还应吸收银行、供销合作社等部门熟悉财务会计工作的干部，兼做辅导工作。互助合作网、会计互助组等群众性的互教互学组织，对于提高会计员的思想和业务水平，改进和提高农业生产合作社的财务管理工作会起很大的作用。今后必须对这些群众性的组织加强领导，充分发挥它们的作用。
