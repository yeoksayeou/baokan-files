    The Wish for Peace, the Will of Steel
    Li Feng'en, Member of the Liaoning Provincial Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, Anshan Iron and Steel Works Special-Class Labor Model, Deputy Chief Technician of Furnace Front, Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant

    In December 1952, I participated in the World People's Peace Congress in Vienna, where I personally witnessed the powerful force of peace-loving people around the world. This force has caused tremendous failures for the aggressive policies of American imperialism. Now, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council has launched a signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons. As long as peace-loving people around the world enthusiastically respond to this call, the heinous plan of American imperialism to use atomic weapons is also destined to fail.

    The workers and staff of our Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant have expressed great anger at American imperialism's occupation of our territory Taiwan and its use of atomic weapons for intimidation. After the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons began, the workers and staff of our Ironmaking Plant enthusiastically responded to this call. More than 500 people signed on the first day. At the same time, I and the workers and staff of our factory will more actively and conscientiously study and implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, improve ironmaking technology, produce more high-quality iron to build our motherland, consolidate national defense, support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, and defend world peace.

    和平的愿望，钢铁的意志
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会辽宁省分会委员  鞍山市特等劳动模范、鞍钢炼铁厂炉前副总技师  李  凤恩
    一九五二年十二月我参加了在维也纳举行的世界人民和平大会，在那里我亲眼看到了世界爱好和平人民的强大力量。这个力量曾经使美帝国主义的侵略政策遭受了巨大的失败。现在世界和平理事会常务委员会发起了反对使用原子武器的签名运动，只要全世界爱好和平的人民热烈响应这个号召，美帝国主义使用原子武器的罪恶计划也是注定要失败的。
    我们鞍钢炼铁厂的职工对于美帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾和用原子武器进行恐吓，都表示了极大的愤怒。当反对使用原子武器签名运动开始后，我们炼铁厂的职工热烈地响应了这一号召，第一天就有五百多人签了名。同时我和我们厂的职工将更积极地、认真地学习和贯彻苏联专家建议，提高炼铁技术，多炼优质铁来建设祖国，巩固国防，支援人民解放军解放台湾，保卫世界和平。
