Xinhua News Agency: On the occasion of the Soviet Army Day, residents of a street near the Soviet troops stationed in Lüshunkou gratefully recall the friendly assistance they received from the Soviet troops. Several years ago, one summer, the street was hit by a typhoon, and floods inundated the low-lying areas. While the People's Government was leading all the residents of the street to relocate, a team of Soviet troops arrived. They selflessly helped rescue the lives and property of the Chinese people. Han Hongshu's six-year-old daughter fell into the water, and a Soviet soldier immediately rushed into the flood to save the child. Seeing that the street's primary school was having difficulty moving desks and benches, the Soviet troops immediately sent two trucks to move the school's belongings to a safe area.

When the street launched a patriotic health campaign, the Soviet troops provided the residents with many medicines for killing mosquito larvae, and also gave them a lot of gauze and absorbent cotton for making screens and masks. Every year, Soviet soldiers use their spare time to cut grass on the mountains and then transport the grass by truck to the street for the residents to use. According to the lowest estimate, the residents of this street received more than 100,000 jin of firewood from the Soviet troops in 1953 alone. The winter before last, a fire broke out in the home of resident Zhang Jinliang. Nearby Soviet troops immediately came to put out the fire, some diving into the fire to rescue belongings, others taking off their clothes to extinguish the flames, and then quickly calling fire trucks to help put out the fire.

The Soviet troops are very concerned about the cultural life of the residents of this street. Once, a Soviet military officer visited the street's cultural station. He felt that the building needed repairs. The next day, he sent a car, bringing a lot of lime powder, cement, and glass and wood for repairing the building. Usually, nearby Soviet troops often invite residents to watch movies with the Soviet soldiers. During major festivals, residents also invite Soviet troops to participate in festivities. The families of Soviet military officers and Chinese women help each other, often taking care of each other's children while working. Nearly ten years of getting along have made them close friends.

    驻旅顺口地区苏军热情帮助驻地居民
    据新华社讯：在纪念苏联建军节的日子里，旅顺口苏军驻地附近一条街道上的居民，怀着感激的心情回忆苏军部队对他们的友谊帮助。在几年前的一个夏天，这个街道遭受了台风的袭击，洪水漫淹了整个街道的洼地。人民政府正在领导全街居民搬家时，来了一队苏军，他们奋不顾身地帮助抢救中国人民的生命和财产。居民韩洪树的六岁小姑娘跌进水里，一位苏军战士连忙冲进洪水把孩子救出来。苏军看到这个街道小学在搬运桌凳时发生了困难，便立刻开来两辆卡车，把学校的东西搬到了安全地带。
    这个街道在开展爱国卫生运动时，苏军供给了居民许多捕杀孑孓的药剂，又送了许多纱布和药棉给居民做纱网、口罩。每年苏军战士都利用空闲时间到山上割草，然后用卡车把草运到这个街上送给居民用；据最低估计，这个街道的居民在一九五三年一年中收到苏军送来的柴草就有十几万斤。前年冬天，居民张金良家发生了火灾，附近苏军立刻前来救火，有的钻进火里抢救东西，有的把衣服脱下来扑火，随后并迅速地开来了救火车帮助扑灭火灾。
    苏军很关心这个街道居民的文化生活。有一次，一个苏军军官到街道文化站去参观，他觉得这屋子需要修理，第二天就派来了一辆汽车，送来了许多石灰粉、水泥以及玻璃和木板等修理房屋的器材。在平时，附近苏军经常邀请居民同苏军战士一起看电影。每逢重大节日时，居民们也邀请苏军参加联欢。苏军军官家属和中国妇女互相帮助，她们经常在劳动时互相照看孩子。近十年的相处，已使她们结成了亲密的朋友。
