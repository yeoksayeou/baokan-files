I Signed My Name

Beijing Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Workers Vice Chairman, Beijing People's Art Theater Director Cao Yu

Everyone knows that the invention of atomic energy was not intended for killing, just as our ancestors invented fire, they did not intend for the Southern landowners in America to use it to burn innocent black people into charcoal. The transformation of atomic energy into bombs for slaughtering humanity, into tools for intimidating mothers and children, and for exploiting the blood and sweat of honest people, is the doing of American imperialism. Ten years ago, American imperialists already experimented on innocent Japanese children and mothers. Ten years later, today, the American ruling group—the Eisenhowers—are again preparing to use atomic bombs to launch a third world war against China, the Soviet Union, and the whole world.

When a sharp blade is hanging over one's head, a person may feel fear. But when the possibility of American imperialist atomic weapons exploding is hanging over the heads of people all over the world, what we feel is not fear, but a bellyful of anger. Today is not yesterday, the forces of peace have grown stronger. Even when we were not as strong as we are today, the threats, intimidation, and armed intervention of American imperialism did not save them from failure. Today, the powerful and united Chinese people and the peace forces of the world will even less allow the American aggressors to extend their bloody hands towards us again. We want to tell the warmongers: the anger of one person may be temporarily suppressed, but the common anger of the people of the world is more terrible to the American imperialists than atomic bombs. If the American ruling group drops that deadly thing, it will not be the people who fall, but American imperialism. If it really starts a world war, the enemy it encounters will be the great peace forces that will completely and utterly wipe them off the face of the earth. Those who play with fire will inevitably die by fire, and those who play with atomic bombs will inevitably die by atomic bombs!

We thank the Soviet people and the Soviet government, they were the first to use atomic energy for peaceful construction. The first atomic energy industrial power station in the history of mankind is already radiating light and heat on socialist soil. At the same time, we know that even in the manufacture of hydrogen weapons, it is no longer the Soviet Union that is lagging behind, but the United States. Peace-loving people are not lambs to be slaughtered. Even so, the Soviet government has consistently advocated banning the use of atomic weapons and destroying its stockpiles in the past and present. Because for us, defending world peace is a sacred cause.

We have the strength to defend peace, and we also have the responsibility to stop American imperialism from launching wars of aggression. Whether or not a war occurs does not depend entirely on the subjective wishes of the imperialists. If it were solely according to their wild ideas, the Third World War would have already occurred. World peace has been preserved until now because the will of each of us to defend peace has been playing a role. The American warmongers who clamor to use atomic weapons to attack the Soviet Union, China, and Korea, and who obstruct our liberation of Taiwan, cannot scare us. Taiwan is our territory. The people of the new China, who love peace and firmly believe in the power of peace, have never thought of invading others, but will never allow any crazy enemy to occupy their own land. A happy and peaceful life will inevitably come to that suffering land due to our liberation of Taiwan. Our compatriots in Taiwan are eagerly waiting for us, and no threat of atomic weapons can stop our determination. Because history proves that bombs can never destroy the people, but the people destroy the bombs!

I signed the "Appeal to the People of the World Against the Use of Atomic Weapons." I signed my name with a heart full of confidence and pride. The great Chinese people have stood up, and I feel from the bottom of my heart that the evil forces that are dragging history backward no longer have the power to drag us back into the darkness. It is now late at night; it is a cold and vibrant early spring night in Beijing. The wind has subsided, and I go outside, the air in Beijing is calm and peaceful. In the dark sky, the dense stars appear so extraordinarily clean and bright. I breathe in the free and fresh night air of early spring, and I think, in this early spring night in China, the winter wheat in the fields of the collective farms is quietly growing, and the blast furnaces of many industrial cities are spewing out surging molten iron. This is the moment when mothers are holding their beloved children, fast asleep, this is the moment when Chairman Mao is planning the construction of the motherland. I am filled with a feeling of happiness, and I want to dedicate all my strength to the struggle for peace, to the struggle for the great future of the motherland. In this late night, I am not the only one who thinks this way, I believe that countless Chinese people will have the same feeling as me. Millions upon millions of Chinese people have signed their names with the same belief, determination, and feeling of pride. That belief, that determination will be transformed into a huge force, enough to repel any clamor, threat, and attack from the enemy.

    谁都知道，原子能的发明不是用来杀人的，正如同我们的祖先发明了火，并没有准备给美国南方的地主们用来把无告的黑人烧成焦炭。原子能变成为屠杀人类的炸弹，变成恐吓母亲和孩子，压榨正直人民的血汗的工具，是美帝国主义做的事情。十年以前，美帝国主义者已经在无辜的日本孩子和母亲身上试验过了，十年以后的今天，美国统治集团——艾森豪威尔们，又在准备着使用原子弹来向中国，苏联和全世界，发动第三次世界大战。
    在头顶上时刻悬着利刃的威胁的时候，一个人可能感到畏惧。但是当着全世界人民的头顶上悬着美帝国主义的原子武器爆炸的可能的时候，我们感到的不是畏惧而是满腔的愤怒。今天不是昨天，和平的力量已经壮大起来。在我们还没有像今日这样壮大的时候，美帝国主义的威胁、恐吓和武装干涉都没有挽救他们的失败。今天，强大团结的中国人民和全世界的和平力量，更不允许美国侵略者再向我们伸出血腥的手。我们要告诉战争贩子们：一个人的愤怒也许可以暂时按捺得下，全世界人民共同的愤怒，对美帝国主义者是比原子弹还要可怕的。如果一旦美国统治集团扔下了那致命的东西，倒在地下的将不是人民，而是美帝国主义。如果它真的掀起世界大战，它所遇到的敌人将是会彻底地、完全把他们从地球上消灭干净的伟大的和平力量。玩火的必然死于火，玩弄原子弹的必然死于原子弹！
    我们感谢苏联人和苏联的政府，他们第一次把原子能运用在和平建设上。有人类历史以来第一个原子能工业电力站已经在社会主义国土上放着光和热。同时我们知道，即使在氢武器的制造上，落后的也已经不是苏联，而是美国了。爱和平的人们并不是任人屠宰的羔羊。虽然这样，苏联政府过去和现在都坚决主张禁止原子武器的使用，并且销毁它的储藏。因为对我们来说，保卫世界和平是神圣的事业。
    我们有力量捍卫和平，我们也有责任来制止美帝国主义发动侵略战争。战争的发生与否并不完全取决于帝国主义的主观愿望，如果仅仅按照它的狂想的话，第三次世界大战早就发生了。世界和平保卫到现在，一直是因为我们每个人捍卫和平的意志在发挥着作用。叫嚣着要用原子武器来攻击苏联、中国和朝鲜，并且阻挠我们解放台湾的美国好战分子们是吓不倒我们的。台湾是我们的领土。热爱和平并且坚信和平力量的新中国的人民从没想过侵犯别人，但也决不允许任何疯狂的敌人来侵占自己的土地。幸福和平的生活必然由于我们的解放台湾，降临到那目前正在受难的土地上。台湾的同胞们眼巴巴地等待着我们，任何原子武器的威吓拦不住我们的决心。因为历史证明，炸弹永远消灭不了人民，而是人民消灭炸弹！
    我在反对使用原子武器“告全世界人民书”上签了名。我是充满了信心和骄傲的心情签下名的。伟大的中国人民已经站起来了，我从心里感觉到拉着历史倒退的恶势力再也没有力量把我们拉回到黑暗里去。现在已经是深夜了；这是北京早春的冷冽而充满了生气的夜晚。风息了，我走到外面，北京的空气宁静而和平。乌黑的天空上，繁密的星星显得那样出奇地干净而明亮。我呼吸着自由清新的早春的夜气，我想，在这个中国的早春的深夜里，集体农庄土地里的冬麦正在暗暗地滋长，许多工业城的高炉正在吐出奔腾的铁水。这是母亲正抱着爱儿酣睡的时刻，这是毛主席正在计划着祖国建设的时刻。我充满了幸福的感觉，我想拿出一切力量为着和平斗争，为祖国的伟大前途斗争。在这深夜里不只是我一个人这样想，我相信，无数的中国人会跟我有同样的感觉。千千万万的中国人都是以同样的信念、决心和骄傲的感觉签了名。那信念、那决心将化成巨大的力量，足以打退敌人的任何叫嚣、威吓和进攻。
