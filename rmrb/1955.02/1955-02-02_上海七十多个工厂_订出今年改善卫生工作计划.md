More than 70 Factories in Shanghai
Formulate Plans for Improving Hygiene Work This Year

More than 70 state-owned and joint state-private factories in Shanghai have formulated plans for improving factory hygiene and medical work in 1955.

The Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, under the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, has determined that this year it will conduct measurements of high temperatures, dust, strong light, chemical substances, and harmful gases in key workshops, and conduct a comprehensive safety and hygiene inspection of the entire factory. This year, the factory will disinfect approximately 100,000 square meters of area in dormitories, toilets, bathrooms, kitchens, the surroundings of workshops, etc., and will also hold safety and hygiene exhibitions, conduct hygiene knowledge lectures for female workers, show hygiene education films, and train workshop health workers.

The Asia Steel Factory cleaned up the hygiene and medical statistics from October 1953 to September 1954, and learned from them that the main reasons affecting workers' absenteeism were diseases such as pulmonary tuberculosis, industrial injuries, colds, and acute gastroenteritis. The factory has incorporated the prevention of the above diseases into this year's hygiene work plan.

The Shanghai Chemical Factory plans to add and modify equipment for removing harmful gases and dust in relevant workshops this year. The joint state-private Dalong Machine Factory No. 2 plans to add protective goggles for workers to prevent iron filings from flying into their eyes during work.

In the process of formulating plans, all factories emphasized studying issues such as establishing factory mass hygiene organizations, carrying out mass preventive work, and promoting hygiene knowledge. Many factories requested that workshop health workers be trained once within the year so that they can understand general industrial and living hygiene knowledge, can reflect the hygiene situation in the workshops, and can urge the improvement of workshop hygiene work. Some factories also requested that they be able to handle first aid and bandaging for industrial injuries, electric shocks, and poisoning in the workshops.

Currently, several large factories have adjusted the leadership relationship of factory hygiene work, changing the medical room (or health room), which was originally led by the administrative section and the general affairs section, to be directly led by the factory director, in order to strengthen the management of hygiene work. The Shanghai Office of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry and the East China Steel Company of the Ministry of Heavy Industry and other units have held special meetings on formulating this year's hygiene work plan, and have made arrangements and instructions for their affiliated factories. The industrial bureaus of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government have also held similar meetings, and many factories under these bureaus have formulated this year's hygiene and medical work plans.

    上海七十多个工厂
    订出今年改善卫生工作计划
    上海市有七十多个国营和公私合营工厂已订出一九五五年改善厂内卫生医疗工作的计划。
    第一机械工业部所属上海柴油机厂确定今年对重点车间的高温、粉尘、强光、化学物质、有害气体进行测定工作，并进行全厂安全卫生大检查。这个厂今年要在宿舍、厕所、浴室、厨房、车间周围等处约有十万平方公尺的地方进行消毒，并要举行安全卫生展览会、举办女工卫生知识讲座、放映卫生教育电影和训练车间保健员。
    亚细亚钢铁厂清理了一九五三年十月到一九五四年九月一年中的卫生医疗统计资料，从中了解到影响工人缺勤的主要原因是肺结核、工业外伤、感冒、急性胃肠炎等几种疾病。这个厂把做好以上几种疾病的预防工作，订入了今年的卫生工作计划。
    上海化工厂准备今年在有关车间添置和改装驱除有害气体和除尘的设备。公私合营大隆机器厂第二厂准备为工人添置护目眼镜，以防止工作时铁屑飞入眼中。
    各厂在订计划中都曾着重研究过建立工厂群众卫生组织、开展群众性预防工作和卫生知识宣传工作等问题。很多工厂要求在年内对车间保健员进行一次训练，使他们能了解一般工业卫生及生活卫生的常识，可以反映车间卫生情况，督促改进车间卫生工作。有的厂并要求他们能担任车间的工伤、触电、中毒的急救及包扎工作。
    目前，若干大厂已调整了厂内卫生工作的领导关系，把原来由行政科、总务科领导的医务室（或保健室）改由厂长直接领导，以加强对卫生工作的管理。第一机械工业部上海办事处和重工业部华东钢铁公司等单位，都曾就拟订今年的卫生工作计划举行过专门会议，对所属各厂作了布置和指示。上海市人民政府各工业管理局也举行过类似的会议，这些局所属的很多工厂订出了今年的卫生医疗工作计划。　（新华社）
