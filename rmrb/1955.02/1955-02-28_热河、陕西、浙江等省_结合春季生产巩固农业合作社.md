    Consolidate agricultural cooperatives in conjunction with spring production
    [By Our Correspondent] Rehe, Shaanxi, Zhejiang and other provinces are continuing to consolidate agricultural production cooperatives in conjunction with spring production.
    The majority of agricultural production cooperatives that have undergone rectification have formulated production plans and are actively preparing for spring ploughing. In Rehe Province, 40% of the 12,000 agricultural production cooperatives have completed rectification. In various localities, the rectification work generally starts with mobilizing production, combined with resolving specific problems within the cooperatives, and assisting agricultural production cooperatives in formulating production plans. When formulating production plans, the members give priority to the needs of the state. In Chaoyang County, a cotton-producing area of Rehe Province, many agricultural production cooperatives are trying in various ways to solve the difficulty of insufficient cotton seeds in order to ensure the completion of the state's cotton planting plan, and are preparing to increase cotton production as much as possible. The Lianmeng Agricultural Production Cooperative in Guojiawopu Village plans to plant cotton on 44.2% of its cultivated land this year, an increase of 7% over last year. The "One Four" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Dongpozi Village, Lingyuan County, plans to improve cultivation techniques and plant more disaster-resistant and high-yielding varieties in order to increase grain crop yields and strive to sell 50% more surplus grain to the state this autumn than last year. In Zhejiang Province, the awareness and production enthusiasm of members of agricultural production cooperatives that have undergone rectification have been greatly improved. After rectification, the 20 agricultural production cooperatives in the Xinjian District of Jinyun County have generally formulated production plans. The original production management of the Second Agricultural Production Cooperative in Baiyun Township, Pan'an County, was chaotic, and the thinking of some members was unstable. After summarizing the benefits of running the cooperative, tapping the potential for increased production, and calculating the possible increase in income for each household this year, the members' enthusiasm for labor was high, and they planted more than 40 mu of oil tea in one day. In Shaanxi Province, the consolidation and continued development of agricultural production cooperatives are carried out in conjunction with the formulation of production plans and specific arrangements for spring production. After the establishment of the Huoxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in Chunhua County, a production plan was formulated in a timely manner, and the members proposed to strive to hoe the first time over all 990 mu of wheat fields in the cooperative as early as possible. The 133 newly established agricultural production cooperatives in Yangxian County have all established labor organizations, formulated short-term production plans, and arranged production after the Spring Festival.
    Various localities are vigorously consolidating newly established agricultural production cooperatives during spring plowing. In order to strengthen the consolidation of new cooperatives, seven counties in Zhejiang Province, including Shaoxing, Jiaxing, and Xiaoshan, have equipped 217 cadres with experience in leading mutual aid and cooperation to district-level organs. Many regions are holding representative conferences of cooperatives at the county and district levels, and then relying on these representatives and the grassroots organizations of the Chinese Communist Party in the countryside to carry out the work of consolidating new cooperatives. At the same time, the relevant provincial organs are providing economic and technical assistance to the new cooperatives. Currently, there are more than 14,000 agricultural production cooperatives in the province that have basically been brought onto the right track, accounting for about one-third of the total number of cooperatives. According to statistics from 12 counties in Jiaxing Prefecture, more than 70% of the new cooperatives have been rectified or are being rectified. In Shaanxi Province, county, district, and township-level cadre meetings have been generally convened in all counties of the province. The counties in Baoji Prefecture analyzed the various problems existing in the existing agricultural production cooperatives and provided specific assistance to them. The Liquan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has organized seven inspection teams to go to various districts to focus on consolidating the newly established agricultural production cooperatives. The District Committees of the Xunyi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party have designated special personnel to take turns to help work in the newly established agricultural production cooperatives and have appropriately adjusted the phenomenon that the distribution ratio of land, labor, and dividends in a small number of agricultural production cooperatives is not reasonable enough. Xingping County has extracted 109 cadres to take charge of the consolidation of the old agricultural production cooperatives and divided the five newly established large cooperatives into ten cooperatives to adapt to the current leadership level of the backbone within the cooperatives and the awareness level of the vast number of members. Baoji, Mei County, Chunhua and other counties have also established some joint cooperative committees to help the newly established agricultural production cooperatives consolidate quickly.

    热河、陕西、浙江等省
    结合春季生产巩固农业合作社
    【本报讯】热河、陕西、浙江等省结合春季生产继续进行农业生产合作社的巩固工作。
    经过整顿的农业生产合作社大部分订出了生产计划，积极准备春耕。热河省一万二千个农业生产合作社已有百分之四十整顿完毕。各地在整社时，一般都从发动生产入手，结合解决社内具体问题，帮助农业生产合作社制订了生产计划。在制订生产计划时，社员们都尽先考虑国家的需要。热河省产棉区朝阳县不少农业生产合作社为了保证完成国家植棉计划，从多方面想办法解决棉籽不足的困难，准备尽量增产棉花。郭家窝铺村联盟农业生产合作社今年计划在百分之四十四点二的耕地上种棉，种棉面积要比去年增加百分之七。凌源县东坡子村
  “一四”农业生产合作社，计划改进耕作技术，多种抗灾多产的品种，以提高粮食作物产量，争取今年秋天卖给国家的余粮较去年增加百分之五十。浙江省经过整顿的农业生产合作社，社员的觉悟和生产积极性都大大提高。缙云县新建区二十个农业生产合作社在整顿后，普遍订出了生产计划。磐安县白云乡第二农业生产合作社原来的生产管理较乱，部分社员思想不稳定，经过总结办社好处，挖掘增产潜力和计算今年每户可能增加的收入后，社员劳动情绪高涨，在一天内就种下油茶四十多亩。陕西省各地在巩固和继续发展农业生产合作社中，都是结合制订生产计划和具体安排春季生产工作进行的。淳化县火星农业生产合作社建成后，及时订出了生产计划，社员们提出要把全社九百九十多亩麦田争取提早锄过头遍。洋县的一百三十三个新建农业生产合作社都在春节后建立了劳动组织，制订了短期生产计划，安排了生产。
    各地在春耕中对新建农业生产合作社大力进行巩固工作。浙江省绍兴、嘉兴、萧山等七个县为加强巩固新社的工作，给区一级机关配备了二百十七名有领导互助合作经验的干部。许多地区正分县、分区召开合作社代表会议，而后依靠这些代表和农村中国共产党的基层组织进行巩固新社工作。与此同时，省有关机关正从经济上、技术上来援助新社。现在全省农业生产合作社已基本纳入正轨的有一万四千多个，约占总社数的三分之一。嘉兴专区据十二个县的统计，已整顿和正在整顿的新社占新社总数的百分之七十以上。陕西省全省各县已普遍召开了县、区、乡三级干部会议。宝鸡专区各县分析了现有农业生产合作社存在的各类问题，并对它们进行了具体帮助。中共醴泉县委员会已组织了七个检查组分赴各区有重点地进行巩固新建农业生产合作社的工作。中共栒邑县各区委员会都指定专人轮流到各新建农业生产合作社帮助工作，并对少数农业生产合作社内土地劳力分红比例不够合理的现象进行了适当的调整。兴平县抽出一百零九名干部专管老农业生产合作社的巩固工作，并将五个新建的大社分成十个社，以适应当前社内骨干的领导水平和广大社员的觉悟程度。宝鸡、郿县、淳化等县，还成立了一些联社委员会帮助新建农业生产合作社迅速巩固起来。
