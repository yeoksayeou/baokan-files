Laiyang Prefecture promptly Restores and Establishes Grain Markets

In Shandong Province, after the conclusion of the unified grain purchase work, Laiyang Prefecture promptly established and restored more than one hundred state-owned grain markets. Zhaoyuan County once convened meetings of district chiefs, directors of supply and marketing cooperatives, and exchange directors. Each district also held meetings of township cadres. By summarizing the experiences and gains of establishing state-owned grain markets in the previous stage, they deeply carried out education on the policy of unified grain purchase and marketing, enabling the vast number of cadres to establish confidence and determination in running state-owned grain markets well. After the unified grain purchase work was largely completed, this county quickly established seventeen state-owned grain markets. Cadres from the Huang County Town Exchange and the Grain Bureau conducted propaganda and education among the masses and specifically helped farmers weigh, evaluate, and calculate accounts. As a result, the amount of grain entering the market in Huang County Town gradually increased. At present, many state-owned grain markets regularly have more than 1,000 jin of grain on the market, and some have as much as 10,000 to 20,000 jin, which plays a significant role in helping farmers adjust their grain supply and invigorate the rural economy.

    莱阳专区及时恢复和建立粮食市场
    山东省莱阳专区各地随着粮食统购工作的结束，及时建立和恢复了一百多处国家粮食市场。招远县曾经召集区长、供销合作社主任、交易所长等开会，各区也召开乡干部会议，通过总结前一阶段建立国家粮食市场的经验、收获，深入进行粮食统购统销政策的教育，使广大干部树立了办好国家粮食市场的信心和决心。这个县在粮食统购工作大体结束以后，就迅速建立起十七处国家粮食市场。黄县城交易所和粮食局的干部一面向群众进行宣传教育，一面具体帮助农民过磅、评价、算账。黄县城集的粮食上市量因而逐渐增加。目前，许多国家粮食市场经常上市粮食在一千斤以上，有的多达一、二万斤，对于帮助农民调剂粮食和活跃农村经济起了不少作用。　（王寿汉等）
