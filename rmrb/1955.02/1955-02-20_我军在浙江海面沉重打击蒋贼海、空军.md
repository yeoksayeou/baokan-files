Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army struck Chiang Kai-shek's navy in the Zhejiang coastal waters on the 18th and shot down one of Chiang Kai-shek's aircraft.

The battle took place around the Taishan Islands off the coast of Zhejiang. At 7:30 AM on the 18th, a certain艇 (Tǐng, Naval vessel unit) of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy, while sailing to the sea area 10 kilometers away from the Taishan Islands, encountered Chiang Kai-shek's navy. Our 艇 immediately bombarded Chiang Kai-shek's warships with fierce artillery fire and continued to sail towards the Taishan Islands. At about 9:00 AM, when our 艇 approached the Taishan Islands, our artillery units stationed on the Taishan Islands also launched a fierce bombardment of Chiang Kai-shek's warships. Under the combined bombardment of our 艇 artillery fire and ground artillery fire, Chiang Kai-shek's four Yong-class warships fled in panic under the cover of thick fog. Our 艇 then all sailed to the Taishan Islands. At 11:40 AM, two Chiang Kai-shek F-84 fighter planes intruded into the airspace above our Taishan Islands and were immediately subjected to fierce fire from our anti-aircraft artillery. One of them was shot down and fell into the sea two nautical miles south of the Taishan Islands.

Chiang Kai-shek's "Ministry of National Defense," which often specializes in fabricating battle results, as usual, published false battle results after Chiang Kai-shek's army suffered this blow, falsely claiming the so-called "brilliant results" of "sinking" our 艇.

People here pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek's extremely boring lies can absolutely not cover up its actual defeat.

    我军在浙江海面沉重打击蒋贼海、空军
    【新华社北京十九日讯】中国人民解放军十八日在浙江沿海打击了蒋贼海军，并击落蒋贼飞机一架。
    战斗是在浙江前线的台山列岛周围发生的。中国人民解放军海军某艇队，于十八日七时三十分航行到距台山列岛十公里的海面时，与蒋贼海军遭遇，我军艇队立即以猛烈炮火向蒋贼军舰轰击，并继续向台山列岛航进。九时许，我军各艇队驶近台山列岛时，驻台山列岛的我军炮队也一齐向蒋贼军舰展开了猛烈轰击。在我艇队炮火和地面炮火的联合轰击下，蒋贼四艘永字号军舰慌忙借着浓雾的掩护逃去。我军各艇队随即全部驶抵台山列岛。十一时四十分，蒋贼F—84型飞机两架窜入我台山列岛上空，当即遭到我军高射炮火的猛烈射击，其中一架被击落，坠入台山列岛以南二浬的海中。
    经常以捏造战果为能事的蒋贼“国防部”，在蒋贼军遭到这个打击后，照例发表假战果，凭空虚构“击沉”我艇队的所谓“辉煌战果”。
    此间人士指出：蒋贼这种穷极无聊的谎言，是绝对掩饰不了它实际上的败绩的。
