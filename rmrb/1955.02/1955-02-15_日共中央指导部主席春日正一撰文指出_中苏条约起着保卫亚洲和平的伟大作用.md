    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 14th: Kasuga Shoichi, Chairman of the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party, published an article in the February issue of "Zenei" magazine entitled "Welcoming the Fifth Anniversary of the Signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance."
    The article stated: The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance has played a great role in defending Asian peace since the day it was signed. The article continued: The solid unity between China and the Soviet Union, based on this treaty, achieved armistice in Korea and Indochina, extinguished the flames of war in Asia and the world, and made a great contribution to easing international tensions and achieving lasting peace. The brotherly alliance between China and the Soviet Union, as demonstrated by this treaty, clearly shows that it not only gives tremendous strength to stopping imperialist aggression in Asia and inspiring the cause of Asian nations striving for independence, but it also serves as the core of the peace, democracy, and socialism camp, and as a fortress defending world peace, exerting invincible power.
    The article said: The reactionary forces in Japan are distorting propaganda about this treaty, attempting to make people believe that Japan's policy of subordination to the United States is "reasonable." The article pointed out: However, the Japanese people have realized that Japan's current independence is only formal, that Japan is unilaterally subordinate to the United States, is in a position of being a squeezed colony, and is being dragged into America's war policy. An increasingly wide range of Japanese people recognize the position of China and the Soviet Union in this treaty of defending peace and independence, and this position has become the strength of their struggle.
    The article concluded: As we celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, we thank the people of China and the Soviet Union for the great support they have given to the Japanese people's struggle for independence, peace, and democracy, and we must widely convey this policy to the Japanese people.

    日共中央指导部主席春日正一撰文指出
    中苏条约起着保卫亚洲和平的伟大作用
    【新华社十四日讯】东京消息：日本共产党中央指导部主席春日正一在二月号的“前卫”杂志上发表了一篇文章，题目是“迎接中苏友好同盟互助条约签订五周年”。
    文章说：中苏友好同盟互助条约从签订的那一天起，就起着保卫亚洲和平的伟大作用。文章接着说：以这一条约为基础的中苏两国的巩固的团结，在朝鲜和印度支那实现了停战，扑灭了亚洲和世界上的战火，对缓和国际紧张局势和实现持久和平的事业作出了巨大的贡献。中苏两国根据这一条约所表现出来的兄弟般的同盟明确地显示出：它不仅给了制止帝国主义在亚洲的侵略、鼓舞亚洲各民族争取独立的事业以巨大的力量，而且它也作为和平、民主和社会主义阵营的核心，作为保卫世界和平的堡垒而发挥着无敌的力量。
    文章说：日本的反动势力正在歪曲宣传这个条约，企图使人们相信：日本对美国的从属政策是“合理的”。文章指出：但是，日本人民已经认识到日本目前的独立只不过是形式，日本正在片面地从属于美国，处在受着压榨的殖民地地位，并且正在被拉入美国的战争政策中。越来越广泛的日本人民认识到这个条约中中苏两国的保卫和平与独立的立场，这种立场成了他们斗争的力量。
    文章最后说：正当中苏友好同盟互助条约签订五周年之际，我们感谢中苏两国人民对日本人民争取独立、和平和民主的斗争所给予的巨大支持，并且要广泛地把这一政策传达给日本人民。
