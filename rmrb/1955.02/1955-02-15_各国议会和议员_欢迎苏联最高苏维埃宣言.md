    Parliaments and Parliamentarians of Various Countries
    Welcome the Declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR
    German Democratic Republic
    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, Fourteenth] According to TASS, Berlin, Thirteenth: The Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic held a special meeting to study the declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. After the meeting, a statement was issued saying: The Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic fully agrees with the opinions put forward in the declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, namely: Parliaments of all countries now bear a major responsibility for maintaining and consolidating peace, because they are the ones who take legal action on issues of war and peace. Aware of this responsibility, the People's Chamber has more than once in recent years called on all patriotic forces of the German people to maintain and consolidate peace. The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic will continue to advance along this path in the future.
    The statement went on to say that the Presidium of the People's Chamber will strive to establish contact with the parliaments of other countries. Direct contact between the parliaments of Poland, Czechoslovakia, and the German Democratic Republic has already been established at the meeting of representatives of the three parliaments held in Prague at the end of 1954.
    The Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic hopes that the proposal of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR will also be supported by the parliaments of Western European countries.
    England
    [Xinhua News Agency, Thirteenth] According to TASS, London: British Labour Party members of parliament William Warbey, Henry Asben, and Joseph Reeves submitted a draft resolution to the House of Commons on the tenth, welcoming the declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.
    The draft resolution states that the House of Commons has noted with interest the opinion that the parliaments of all countries bear responsibility for maintaining peace, and that the practice of exchanging parliamentary delegations between countries and having parliamentary delegations from one country deliver speeches in the parliaments of other countries can improve relations between countries.
    The draft resolution requests the House of Commons to accept this proposal in principle and expresses its willingness, on a reciprocal basis, to allow foreign parliamentarians to speak in the House of Commons.
    Canada
    [Xinhua News Agency, Thirteenth] TASS New York Twelfth: According to reports from Ottawa, the proposal put forward in the declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR regarding the establishment of direct contact between the parliaments of various countries has received support in the Canadian Parliament. Progressive Conservative members of parliament in both the Senate and the House of Commons believe that exchanging parliamentary delegations with the Soviet Union for visits will ease international tensions.
    Progressive Conservative Senator R. B. Horner told the Senate on the tenth that Canada should first study the Soviet proposal.
    John Diefenbaker, the official spokesman for foreign affairs of the Progressive Conservative Party, said in the House of Commons that the proposal of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR was "worthy of acceptance."
    United States
    [Xinhua News Agency, Thirteenth] TASS Washington Twelfth: Several members of the United States Congress, when commenting on the proposal of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR regarding the exchange of parliamentary delegations, stated: The exchange of delegations "may have some benefits."
    According to the Washington "Star," Democratic Congressman Albert (Oklahoma) said that he would be very willing to welcome members of any parliament in the world.
    Democratic Senator Green (Rhode Island) said: American parliamentarians
  "should carefully study it (the declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR)."
    Republican Congressman Hoffman (Michigan) made a positive assessment of the proposal contained in the declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR regarding the exchange of parliamentary delegations, saying: "They—the Russians—can learn a lot of things here, and at the same time we can learn more things there."

    德意志民主共和国
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社柏林十三日讯：德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团举行特别会议，研究了苏联最高苏维埃的宣言。会后发表声明说：德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团完全同意苏联最高苏维埃的宣言中所提出的意见，即：现在各国议会对维护和巩固和平负有重大的责任，因为就战争和和平问题采取法律行动的就是它们。由于意识到这种责任，人民议院最近几年曾经不止一次地号召德国人民所有的爱国力量来维护和巩固和平。德意志民主共和国人民议院今后仍将沿着这条道路前进。
    声明接着说，人民议院主席团将努力和其他国家的议会建立接触。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克和德意志民主共和国议会之间的直接接触，已经在三国议会代表一九五四年年底在布拉格举行的会议上建立起来了。
    德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团希望，苏联最高苏维埃的建议也会获得西欧国家议会的支持。

    决议草案中说，下院很感兴趣地注意到了这个意见，即各国议会对维护和平负有责任，各国之间互派议会代表团、一国的议会代表团在他国议会中发表演说的做法能够改善国与国之间的关系。
    决议草案要求下院在原则上接受这个建议，并且表示愿意在有来有往的基础上，允许外国议员在下院发言。
    加拿大
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社纽约十二日讯：来自渥太华的消息说，苏联最高苏维埃的宣言中所提出的关于各国议会之间建立直接接触的建议，在加拿大议会中得到了支持。参众两院中的进步保守党议员都认为和苏联互派议会代表团进行访问将能缓和国际紧张局势。
    进步保守党参议员拉·巴·霍尔纳十日对参议院说，加拿大应该首先研究苏联这个建议。
    进步保守党的外交事务正式发言人约翰·迪芬贝克在众议院说，苏联最高苏维埃的建议是“值得接受的”。
    美国
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社华盛顿十二日讯：美国国会的几位议员在就苏联最高苏维埃提出的关于互派议会代表团的建议发表意见时表示：互派代表团“可能有一些好处”。
    据华盛顿“明星报”报道，民主党众议员艾伯特（俄克拉何马州）说，他将很愿意欢迎世界上的任何议会的议员们。
    民主党参议员格林（罗得岛）说：美国议员们
  “应该仔细研究它（苏联最高苏维埃的宣言）”。
    共和党众议员霍夫曼（密执安州）对苏联最高苏维埃的宣言中所包含的关于互派议会代表团的建议作了积极的评价，他说：“他们——俄国人——可以在这里了解很多东西，同时我们可以在那里了解更多的东西。”
