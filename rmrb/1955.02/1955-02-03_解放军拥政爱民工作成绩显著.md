Xinhua News Agency Report: The People's Liberation Army (PLA) has achieved remarkable successes in its work of supporting the government and cherishing the people.

In the past year, the vast numbers of commanders and fighters throughout the army, in addition to actively defending the country, resolutely combating the harassment of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, and safeguarding socialist construction and the people's peaceful labor, also exemplarily observed and implemented the state's various policies and laws. They actively used various methods to promote the Party's General Line and the state's policies of unified purchase and sale of grain, oil, and cotton cloth to the people in their stationed areas and to family members and relatives. They wrote letters encouraging families and relatives to participate in the mutual aid and cooperation movement, purchase national economic construction bonds, and sell surplus grain to the state. Soldiers in a certain company stationed in Shaanxi Province encouraged their families to sell a total of 30,000 jin of surplus grain, and mobilized 69 families to participate in mutual aid teams and 4 families to join agricultural production cooperatives. Commanders and fighters throughout the army also enthusiastically purchased national economic construction bonds. Last year, the entire army purchased 207.211766 billion yuan of national economic construction bonds, exceeding the projected figure by 306 percent.

Last year, commanders and fighters of various units also actively helped the people with production, disaster prevention, disaster relief, and medical treatment. For example, leading organs and commanders and fighters of the Northeast Military Region began in May last year to contract to repair the more than ten-li-long canal widening project on the South Lake in Shenyang. A railway engineering unit of the Railway Corps participating in the construction of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway in southern Shaanxi helped local farmers rush to harvest more than 1,270 mu of wheat in May and June last year. Many units also helped the people in their stationed areas with land reclamation, rice transplanting, weeding, delivering manure, carrying water, carrying firewood, repairing bridges, and repairing houses.

Last summer, many units actively supported and participated in flood prevention and disaster relief work. According to incomplete statistics from units of the East China and Central South Military Regions, a total of more than 101,000 commanders and fighters participated in local flood prevention. In Jiangsu and Anhui Military Regions alone, a total of more than 1.3 million workdays were invested in flood prevention and drainage. In one area, a river embankment breached, and the local public security forces traveled more than fifty li overnight to rush to plug the breach, fighting the flood for seven days and nights, finally plugging the breach, strengthening the embankment, and eliminating the threat of the flood. To relieve the people in the disaster areas, commanders and fighters throughout the army voluntarily saved one liang of rice per person per day as relief grain from September 1st to the end of last year. The Central South Military Region saved more than 4 million jin of grain from January to September last year, which was promptly handed over to the local government to relieve disaster victims. According to incomplete statistics from the Northwest, Southwest, Central South, and Northeast Military Regions and the General Headquarters and directly subordinate units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, 7.4396009 billion yuan in disaster relief funds have been donated. And four units also donated 13,576 items of clothing.

Units stationed in ethnic minority areas strictly observe national ethnic policies and respect the customs and habits of all ethnic groups. All units vigorously help the people of ethnic minorities develop their economies and cultural undertakings, and also help them chop firewood, carry water, repair bridges, repair roads, sow seeds, harvest crops, provide haircuts, and carry out epidemic prevention and treatment. For example, units stationed in the Yunnan border area enthusiastically help the people of ethnic minorities gradually improve production methods and cultivation techniques, so that output is rapidly increased and production is developed. Units in the Xinjiang region participating in agricultural production sent many cadres and technicians last year to go deep into the countryside to help farmers carry out the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

    解放军拥政爱民工作成绩显著
    据新华社讯：中国人民解放军各部队的拥政爱民工作做出了显著的成绩。
    在过去一年中，全军各部队广大指挥员、战斗员，除积极保卫国防，坚决打击蒋贼军的骚扰，保卫社会主义建设和人民和平劳动外，并模范地遵守和贯彻了国家的各项政策法令，积极地用各种方式向驻地人民，向家属亲友宣传了党的总路线和国家关于粮食、油料、棉布的统购统销政策，写信鼓励家庭和亲友参加互助合作运动、认购国家经济建设公债和将余粮卖给国家。驻陕西省某部一个连队的战士，即鼓励家属卖余粮共三万斤，并动员六十九户家属参加了互助组，四户家属加入了农业生产合作社。全军各部队指挥员、战斗员并热烈认购国家经济建设公债。去年全军共认购国家经济建设公债二千零七十二亿一千一百七十六万六千元，超过预计数字百分之三百零六。
    各部队指挥员、战斗员去年并积极地帮助人民进行生产、防灾、救灾、治病等活动。如东北军区领导机关和部队指挥员、战斗员，自去年五月开始，包修了沈阳南湖十多里长的运河加宽工程。在陕西南部参加建筑宝成铁路的铁道兵某部，去年五、六月帮助当地农民抢收了一千二百七十多亩小麦。许多部队还帮助驻地人民开荒、插秧、锄草、送粪、担水、担柴、修桥、修房等。
    去年夏天，许多部队积极支援和参加了防汛救灾工作。据华东、中南军区部队不完全统计，参加地方防汛的指挥员、战斗员共有十万零一千余人。仅江苏、安徽军区先后投入防汛、排涝工作的计有一百三十多万个工。某地河堤决口，当地公安部队连夜走了五十多里去抢堵，与洪水搏斗七昼夜，终于堵住决口，加强了堤防，解除了洪水的威胁。全军指挥员、战斗员为救济灾区人民，自去年九月一日起到年底止，每人每日自动节约一两米作为救济粮。中南军区去年一月至九月份节约粮食四百多万斤，均及时交给地方政府救济灾民。据西北、西南、中南、东北军区和中国人民解放军总部、直属部队等不完全统计，已捐出救灾款七十四亿三千九百六十万零九千元。并有四个单位还捐献衣物一万三千五百七十六件。
    驻少数民族地区的部队，都严格地遵守民族政策和尊重各民族的风俗习惯。各部队并大力帮助少数民族人民发展经济、文化事业，还帮助他们砍柴、背水、修桥、补路、播种、收割、理发、防疫、治病等。如驻云南边疆的部队，热情地帮助少数民族人民逐步改进生产方法和耕作技术，使产量迅速提高，生产获得发展。新疆地区参加农业生产的部队，在去年曾派出许多干部和技术人员，深入农村帮助农民开展互助合作运动。
