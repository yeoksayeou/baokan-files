    The Soviet government suggested to Britain and India on February 4 that a conference could be initiated by Britain, the Soviet Union, and India in February, held in Shanghai or New Delhi, with the participation of the People's Republic of China, the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, France, India, Burma, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Ceylon to discuss the dangerous situation in Taiwan and other coastal islands of China. This is another effort by the Soviet Union to ease tensions in the Far East. The Chinese people welcome and support this proposal from the Soviet Union.
      The dangerous situation currently existing in the Taiwan region of China is entirely the result of the United States occupying China's territory of Taiwan and Penghu, interfering in China's internal affairs, and carrying out war provocations and attempts to expand aggression against the Chinese people. In order to eliminate the tensions caused by the United States' interference in China's internal affairs and aggression against China, the Soviet Union submitted a proposal to the United Nations Security Council on January 31 regarding "the aggressive actions of the United States of America against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan and other island regions of China." The Chinese government supports this just proposal from the Soviet Union.
    However, the United States not only refused to expel the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique from the United Nations, so that representatives of the People's Republic of China could attend the Security Council to discuss the Soviet proposal, but also manipulated the Security Council on February 14 to reject the discussion of the Soviet proposal, thus rendering the Security Council completely powerless in the face of American aggression. Under these circumstances, the Soviet Union's proposal to convene an international conference to discuss the dangerous situation in the Taiwan region has opened up a new path for easing the tense situation in the Taiwan region and the Far East, which is sincerely welcomed by all peace-loving people.
    The proposed members of the conference are completely reasonable. According to the Soviet proposal, the members of the conference include major powers with special responsibilities for maintaining world peace. Among them, the People's Republic of China and the United States, which occupies China's territory of Taiwan, are the two parties directly related to the Taiwan situation. The conference also includes five important Asian countries that are particularly concerned about peace in Asia: India, Burma, Indonesia, Pakistan, and Ceylon. Such a conference includes the countries concerned, making it possible to find a solution to ease the Taiwan situation.
    However, the United States has surprisingly opposed the Soviet proposal. According to Agence France-Presse, U.S. State Department officials said on February 12 that the United States could not accept the Soviet proposal because it did not include the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique as a participant in the conference. A spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations also declared that the United States still considers the Taiwan issue to be a so-called "United Nations project."
    The United States insists that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique should participate in the international conference to discuss the Taiwan situation, or that the Taiwan issue is still a "United Nations project." Its intention is very clear. The United States knows that all righteous people in the world believe that the dangerous situation in the Taiwan region is created by the United States single-handedly. Therefore, it wants to push the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique forward and hide behind it in order to falsely claim that the tense situation in the Taiwan region is caused by the Chinese people's internal affair of liberating Taiwan, which is unrelated to the United States' aggressive actions against China. In this way, it can shirk responsibility for American aggression and attempt to place the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and the People's Republic of China on an equal footing in order to realize the conspiracy of "two Chinas." At the same time, the United States has always attempted to use the so-called ceasefire issue in the coastal islands of China to lead the majority of countries in the United Nations to follow the United States in interfering in China's internal affairs and participating in aggressive actions against China.
    The requirements put forward by the United States have nothing in common with the Soviet proposal. The international conference proposed by the Soviet Union is to discuss the dangerous situation caused by the United States' aggression against China's territory of Taiwan, which is a matter between the United States and the People's Republic of China, and has nothing to do with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and elimination of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, just like the Chinese people's liberation of Hainan Island, is entirely China's internal affair, and the United Nations and any international conference have no right to discuss it. The United Nations and international conferences can only discuss the issue of the United States' interference in China's internal affairs and must not be allowed to discuss China's internal affairs, creating interference in China's internal affairs. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is a scum that has long been abandoned by the Chinese people. It cannot represent anyone and is not qualified to attend any international conference. The Chinese people resolutely oppose the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique attending any international conference convened to ease the Taiwan situation.
    It is very clear that the United States' purpose is not to ease the tense situation in the Taiwan region, but to maintain Taiwan as a base for aggression against China, threatening China's security and preparing for a new war. The Chinese people and peace-loving people all over the world must not allow these conspiracies of the United States to succeed.
    Simultaneous with the United States' opposition to the Soviet proposal, the British Foreign Office also issued a statement on February 12 opposing the Soviet proposal, also on the grounds that "the Chinese Nationalist authorities in Taiwan are not included." The statement also said, "Any conference to discuss the situation in the coastal islands and the Taiwan region should be organized in a manner acceptable to the United Nations." It is not difficult to see that the British Foreign Office is actually just copying Washington's platitudes.
    This practice by the British authorities is actually hindering the easing of the tense situation in the Taiwan region, encouraging American aggression and interference in China's internal affairs, and harming Sino-British relations. This policy has not only aroused the irrepressible anger of the Chinese people, but is also incompatible with the interests of the British people.
    The Chinese people's position of safeguarding their territorial sovereignty and resolving international disputes through consultation has won the support of peace-loving countries and people in the world. However, it is regrettable that some countries support China's just position on the one hand, but on the other hand, they express that the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique can participate in the international conference proposed by the Soviet Union.
    The Chinese people's position on the Taiwan issue is very clear and very firm. The Chinese people welcome and support all sincere efforts made internationally to ease the tensions created by the United States in Taiwan and the Far East, but resolutely oppose the American aggressive clique using any excuse and any tool to further interfere in China's internal affairs, divide China's territory, and threaten China's security. The Soviet proposal is in line with this position of the Chinese people and is truly capable of leading to the easing of the situation. There is no doubt that the Soviet proposal will receive the firm support of all who truly wish to ease the situation.

### 坚决支持苏联为和缓远东紧张局势而作的新努力

    坚决支持苏联为和缓远东紧张局势而作的新努力
    苏联政府在二月四日向英国和印度建议：由英国、苏联和印度三国倡议，在二月份内，在上海或新德里举行一个可以有中华人民共和国、美国、英国、苏联、法国、印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和锡兰参加的会议，讨论台湾和其他中国沿海岛屿地区的危险局势的问题。这是苏联为和缓远东紧张局势的又一次努力。中国人民欢迎并支持苏联的这个建议。
      目前在中国台湾地区之所以存在危险局势，完全是美国侵占中国的领土台湾、澎湖，干涉中国的内政，并且对中国人民进行战争挑衅和企图扩大侵略的结果。为了消除由于美国干涉中国内政、侵略中国而引起的紧张局势，苏联曾在一月三十一日向联合国安全理事会提出了“关于美利坚合众国在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为”的提案。中国政府支持苏联的这一正义的提案。
    但是美国不但拒绝将蒋介石卖国集团的代表驱逐出联合国，以便中华人民共和国的代表得以出席安全理事会讨论苏联提案，而且在本月十四日操纵安全理事会拒绝讨论苏联提案，这样就使安全理事会在美国肆行侵略面前完全无能为力。在这种情况下，苏联提出的召开国际会议讨论台湾地区危险局势的建议，就为和缓台湾地区和远东局势的紧张状态开辟了新的道路，这是一切爱好和平的人们所衷心欢迎的。
    苏联所建议的会议成员是完全合理的。按照苏联建议，会议的成员包括负有维持世界和平的特殊责任的大国，其中中华人民共和国和侵占中华人民共和国领土台湾的美国，是与台湾局势直接有关的双方。会议还包括了特别关心亚洲和平的五个重要亚洲国家：印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦和锡兰。这样一个会议包括了有关各国，使它有可能为和缓台湾局势问题找到解决的途径。
    但是美国却竟然反对苏联的建议。据法新社报道，美国国务院的人士在本月十二日表示，由于苏联的建议没有把蒋介石卖国集团列为会议的参与者，所以美国不能接受。美国驻联合国代表团的发言人并且宣称，美国仍然认为台湾问题是一个所谓“联合国的项目”。
    美国硬说蒋介石卖国集团应该参加讨论台湾局势的国际会议，或者说台湾问题仍是“联合国的项目”，它的用意是很明显的。美国知道全世界正义人类都认为台湾地区的危险局势是美国一手造成的，因此它想推出蒋介石卖国集团来，而自己躲在后面，以便把台湾地区的紧张局势硬说成是由于中国人民解放台湾这个内政问题所造成，同美国对中国的侵略行动无关，这样来推卸美国侵略的责任，并企图使蒋介石卖国集团和中华人民共和国处于对等的地位，以实现“两个中国”的阴谋。同时，美国始终企图借所谓中国沿海岛屿地区停火问题，引导联合国的多数国家追随美国干涉中国内政，参与对中国的侵略行动。
    美国所提出的这种要求，同苏联的建议毫无共同之处。苏联建议召开的国际会议，是为了讨论美国侵略中国领土台湾所引起的危险局势问题，也就是讨论美国同中华人民共和国之间的问题，这同蒋介石卖国集团没有任何关系。中国人民解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团，就像中国人民曾经解放海南岛一样，完全是中国的内政，联合国和任何国际会议都无权讨论。联合国和国际会议只能讨论美国干涉中国内政的问题，决不容许讨论中国内政问题，造成对中国内政的干涉。蒋介石卖国集团是中国人民早已唾弃了的渣滓，它不能代表任何人，根本没有资格出席任何国际会议。中国人民坚决反对蒋介石卖国集团出席为和缓台湾局势而召开的国际会议。
    十分明显，美国的目的并不是要和缓台湾地区的紧张局势，而是要保持台湾作为侵略中国的基地，威胁中国的安全和准备新的战争。中国人民和全世界爱好和平人民决不能容许美国的这些阴谋得逞。
    与美国反对苏联建议同时，英国外交部在本月十二日发表声明也反对苏联的建议，理由也是因为“台湾的中国国民党当局没有包括在内”。声明还说，“讨论沿海岛屿和台湾地区局势的任何会议应当根据可以为联合国接受的方式组织起来才是适宜的。”不难看出，英国外交部实际上不过是抄袭了华盛顿方面的滥调。
    英国当局的这种作法实际上就是在阻挠台湾地区的紧张局势的和缓，鼓励美国的侵略和对中国内政的干涉，并损害中英之间的关系。这种政策不但引起了中国人民的不能抑制的愤怒，而且也是同英国人民的利益不相容的。
    中国人民维护自己的领土主权和协商解决国际争端的立场获得了世界上爱好和平的国家和人民的支持。但是有些国家一方面支持中国的这个正义立场，而另一方面却又表示蒋介石卖国集团的代表可以参加苏联所建议召开的国际会议，这不能不使我们感到遗憾。
    中国人民在台湾问题上的立场十分清楚，十分坚定。中国人民欢迎并支持国际上为和缓美国在台湾和远东所造成的紧张局势而作的一切真诚的努力，但是坚决反对美国侵略集团以任何借口并利用任何工具来进一步干涉中国内政，割裂中国领土，并威胁中国安全。苏联的建议符合于中国人民的这种立场，是真正能够导致局势的和缓的。毫无疑问，苏联的建议将得到一切真正愿意和缓局势的人们的坚决支持。
