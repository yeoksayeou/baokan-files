    Three Nuclear Physicists Talk About the Peaceful Use of Atomic Energy and Opposition to the Use of Atomic Weapons
    By our reporter Bai Sheng
    In the just struggle against the American aggressive bloc's preparation for atomic warfare, many of our scientists who love the motherland and cherish peace are at the forefront of this struggle. Stirred by the conscience and sense of justice of scientists, they resolutely advocate using atomic energy for the great ideals and magnificent cause of benefiting mankind, and firmly oppose using the brilliant achievements of scientists' hard work for the vile and brutal crime of slaughtering mankind. On the one hand, they are stepping up research on the peaceful use of atomic energy, to open up a bright and happy future for mankind; on the other hand, they righteously condemn the American aggressive bloc and its accomplices, demanding that they withdraw their sinful, bloody hands. At the same time, they are taking active actions to widely disseminate scientific knowledge about atomic energy and atomic weapons among the people. Professor Zhao Zhongyao, a famous nuclear physicist in our country, Professor Qian Sanqiang, a famous nuclear physicist, and his wife, Dr. He Zehui, who have all personally suffered from the barbaric persecution of American imperialism, are such figures. During the anti-atomic weapons movement in Beijing, I visited these three scientists.
    Qian Sanqiang and his wife once studied nuclear physics and radiochemistry at the Curie Laboratory of the Radium Institute and the Nuclear Chemistry Laboratory of the French Academy of Sciences, under the direction of Joliot-Curie. In December 1946, they discovered the ternary and quaternary fission of uranium nuclei, and were rewarded by Joliot-Curie. At the end of 1946, Qian Sanqiang also won the Physics Prize of the French Academy of Sciences. Professor Zhao Zhongyao has studied nuclear physics in the United States twice. He is one of the earliest experts in our country to study nuclear physics, and has achieved great success in research. In 1946, he visited the American atomic bomb test at Bikini Island. This patriotic and righteous scientist suffered all kinds of persecution from American imperialism on his way back to China from the United States in 1950. Finally, he was imprisoned in Japan by the special agents of American imperialism with shackles in prison, spending forty-seven days as a prisoner. This blatant and shameless act of persecution aroused the nuclear physicist's hatred of American imperialism, and also aroused the solemn protest of peace-loving people.
    When I first visited the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Professor Qian Sanqiang was preparing to leave for Tianjin to give a popular lecture on atomic energy. Professor Zhao Zhongyao was studying the Russian version of Soviet nuclear physics in his research room, preparing to co-write a book of about 80,000 to 90,000 words on atomic energy science with some researchers. Dr. He Zehui was also busy preparing materials to participate in the writing of this book. She also planned to write popular articles about atomic energy for women's magazines, and give popular lectures on scientific knowledge about atomic energy to women. They have already given many lectures during this anti-atomic weapons signature campaign. Like many atomic scientists, they combine their research work with the political struggle to defend peace, making themselves strong fighters on the scientific front for defending peace.
    The three nuclear physicists were very indignant at the American imperialists' attempts to launch an atomic war. Professor Zhao Zhongyao believes that the reason why American imperialism obstructs the peaceful use of atomic energy is because they are afraid that once the development of atomic energy replaces power resources such as coal and oil, these monopoly capitalists in the United States will lose a lot of profits. For the sake of the monopoly capitalists' high profits, they would rather use atomic energy to slaughter hundreds of millions of people. American imperialism is the enemy of the people of the world, and also the enemy of science. They want to monopolize science and use science to serve their profits. If necessary, they can also strangle science and destroy science.
    When talking about the issue of atomic weapons, Qian Sanqiang said: As a nuclear physicist, today I want to tell people that although atomic weapons are weapons with great power and destructive force, their power is by no means as mysterious and indefensible as American imperialism has promoted. In fact, atomic weapons are defensible, and their power is also limited to a certain extent. Atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs can be detonated in water, air, ground, or underground, and the destructive power is greatest when detonated in water. When detonated on the ground, the power will be greatly reduced due to the easy obstruction of various substances on the ground. When an atomic bomb is detonated in the air, a dazzling light will appear first, followed by a thunder-like sound, which can be heard dozens of kilometers away. At the center of the explosion, it will quickly turn into a fireball, the volume of the fireball will increase, rise into the sky, and turn into a cloud. The destructiveness of atomic bombs is nothing more than the following aspects: First, atomic bomb explosions will generate very high temperatures, which will violently oscillate the surrounding air, generating high-speed waves, forming "shock waves" with speeds of hundreds of meters per second. This shock wave can damage reinforced concrete buildings within one kilometer and brick and tile buildings within two kilometers. People within 750 meters of the explosion center will also be injured. However, when people see the flash of the atomic bomb explosion, as long as they immediately hide in the nearest shelter one kilometer away, they can avoid the damage of this shock wave. Hiding in basements, mines, trenches, and other places can all defend against this shock wave. Second, atomic bomb explosions will emit strong radiant light, which can cause fires in the explosion area and can burn the unprotected parts of the human body within one kilometer. If the eyes are directly facing the explosion center of the atomic bomb, they will also be injured or blinded. However, this radiant light is also defensible: any shelter more than one kilometer away can block this light. Wearing light-colored clothes, especially white clothes, can effectively defend against the burns of this light. Third, atomic bomb explosions will emit strong, invisible rays that can penetrate thick objects, called penetrating radiation, which can destroy the human body's blood cell tissue, but the effect of this penetrating radiation is very short, only ten to fifteen seconds, and most of it disappears after one minute. Defensive objects that can generally defend against shock waves more than one kilometer away also have sufficient defensive effects against resisting penetrating radiation. Fourth, during an atomic bomb explosion, the uranium and plutonium fission fragments are scattered outward and attached to dust, which can make many substances in the nearby area radioactive. These radioactive substances can cause radiation sickness to the human body. However, substances contaminated with radioactivity can be checked and identified with instruments. After identification, isolation can be implemented to prevent people from being harmed. Using a general gas mask or a wet towel to cover the mouth and nose can also avoid inhaling radioactive substances into the body. Ninety percent of these radioactive substances lose their effectiveness within fifteen minutes. Of course, there are more proactive ways to defend against atomic bombs, which are to use airplanes to destroy the enemy's bases storing atomic bombs. At the same time, with modern air defense equipment, it can also prevent enemy planes carrying atomic bombs from flying into our airspace.
    Obviously, our scientists are completely realistically understanding atomic weapons. They will never, like American imperialism, shamelessly and deliberately mythically exaggerate the power of atomic weapons to scare the people, create terror, and achieve their ulterior and vile intentions.
    Qian Sanqiang emphasized: Atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs are truly a great threat to the United States and Britain, where the population and industry are very concentrated! But for the Soviet Union and China, which have vast territories and where the population and industry are not very concentrated, the threat is relatively small. As long as we are prepared, American imperialism cannot do anything to us. If it dares to launch an atomic war, it will surely be destroyed, not our peaceful and democratic camp.
    Zhao Zhongyao and He Zehui also used their personal experiences to explain that it is extremely boring and stupid for American imperialism to use atomic weapons to intimidate us. Professor Zhao Zhongyao personally watched the American imperialists' atomic bomb test at Bikini Island in 1946. He said that in order to promote the power of atomic bombs, American imperialism conducted test explosions in the air and water of Bikini Island twice in 1946. What was the result of the experiment? It just proved that the power of atomic bombs is not unimaginable. At that time, American imperialism used more than seventy target ships, arranged on the west sea of ​​Bikini Island, with pigs, sheep, mice, and various foods and equipment on board. After the atomic bomb exploded, only a dozen large and small ships were sunk, and the losses of living things, food, equipment, and other materials on the ships were very light, with an average death rate of less than 20%. At that time, Professor Zhao Zhongyao was sitting on a boat 14 kilometers away from the atomic bomb explosion center to watch, and only two waves were created near the sea surface of the boat he was sitting on.
    He Zehui also talked about the facts she saw when she was studying in Germany during the Second European War. She said that according to scientists' calculations, the damage caused by ordinary bombs in Germany during World War II was equivalent to 450 atomic bombs. This is a considerable number, but at that time, Germany's military production continued to rise, and the ground forces of the Soviet Red Army, not the bombing, finally defeated the German fascist army.
    When talking about the peaceful use of atomic energy, the three nuclear physicists talked so kindly and movingly. They were excited and delighted by the happiness and beautiful prospects that atomic energy could bring to mankind. How eagerly they hope that their great ideals can be realized! Precisely because of this, they hate even more those executioners who attempt to use atomic energy to slaughter mankind.
    The three nuclear physicists told me that as early as 1949, the Soviet Union had already used atomic energy explosions in the hydraulic and irrigation projects of the Ob and Yenisei rivers in Siberia to excavate river channels, turning the vast desert of Turkestan into fertile land. After the Soviet Union built the world's first nuclear power plant and started generating electricity on June 27, 1954, this great miracle in human history gave people a path to a happier life. This world's first nuclear power plant is the first time in human history that it has not used coal and oil as fuel, and has not used wind and water to turn turbines, but instead uses artificially liberated atomic energy to turn turbines to generate electricity. It is constantly supplied with the required heat energy by underground atomic piles. The by-products of the atomic pile—various radioactive isotopes—can also be applied to various sciences. In medicine, the Soviet Union is now using many radioactive isotopes to replace expensive radium to treat cancer in the human body. Moreover, radioactive sodium is used to diagnose the source and condition of diseases, radioactive iodine is used to treat thyroid diseases, and radioactive phosphorus is used to treat angiomas and other skin diseases. At the same time, the Soviet Union has very commonly used radioactive cobalt in the mechanical manufacturing industry to inspect internal damage to metal products. In blast furnaces in the smelting industry, the application of radioactive gases can help understand the activities and changes of these gases in the metallurgical furnace, helping to improve smelting technology. Soviet scientists have used radioactive phosphate fertilizers to increase the yields of sugar beets, potatoes, and cotton.
    Speaking of this, the three nuclear physicists were full of confidence in the happy prospects of the atomic age. They said: Today, this is only the beginning of the atomic age. The Soviet Union has already achieved such great achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy. In the future, after fully utilizing atomic energy, it will surely create a more beautiful picture! If atomic energy is used to power airplanes, it will be possible to achieve high-speed and almost unlimited long-distance space flight. This atomic-powered airplane can break through the Earth's atmosphere and fly into space to explore the secrets of other planets. We can also imagine using atomic energy to melt the huge ice blocks at the North and South Poles, so that the frozen ports near the poles do not freeze, and the frozen soil becomes fertile farmland. Hot places can also become cool places, and arid places can also become humid places. Many great canals will appear on the earth... If human wisdom is developed in the right way, what a brilliant and splendid future and happiness it will create for mankind itself!
    When talking about the Soviet Union's assistance to our country in the peaceful use of atomic energy, the three nuclear physicists were even more filled with joy and excitement. Professor Zhao Zhongyao, who is over fifty years old, said with the enthusiasm and excitement of a young man: The Soviet Union's help in establishing experimental atomic piles will greatly improve our country's scientific and technological level and accelerate the pace of our country's socialist industrialization. With a complete atomic energy science experiment center, we will greatly promote the research work of nuclear physics, and then prepare for the large-scale application of atomic energy in production. Qian Sanqiang said: As a nuclear physics worker, today we must not only exert our strength to study atomic science, but also undertake the task of cultivating new forces so that our country's atomic science research work can develop rapidly with the help of the Soviet Union. In order to ensure that our scientific research work can be carried out smoothly in a peaceful environment, we must first resolutely oppose American imperialism launching an atomic war, demand a strict ban on the use of atomic weapons, and destroy all atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs. We sincerely thank the Soviet Union for its help in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    三位原子核物理学家谈和平利用原子能和反对使用原子武器
    本报记者　柏生
    在反对美国侵略集团准备原子战争的正义斗争中，我国许多热爱祖国、热爱和平的科学家都站在这个斗争的最前列。他们激于科学家的良心和正义感，坚决主张把原子能用于为人类造福的伟大理想和壮丽事业，坚决反对把科学家辛勤劳动所得的辉煌成果用于野蛮残暴的屠杀人类的龌龊罪行。他们一方面加紧研究着原子能的和平利用，要给人类开辟光明幸福的前途；一方面义正词严地斥责美国侵略集团和它的帮凶们，要他们缩回罪恶的血手。同时他们正以积极的行动在人民群众中广泛传播着对于原子能和原子武器的科学知识。曾经身受过美帝国主义野蛮迫害的我国著名原子核物理学家赵忠尧教授、著名原子核物理学家钱三强教授和他的夫人何泽慧博士，就是这样的人物。在北京市反对使用原子武器运动期间，我访问了这三位科学家。
    钱三强夫妇曾经在法国约里奥·居里主持的镭学研究所居里实验室和法兰西学院原子核化学实验室里研究原子核物理和放射化学。他们在一九四六年十二月发现铀原子核的三部分裂和四部分裂，受到过约里奥·居里的奖励。一九四六年年底，钱三强并获得法国科学院的物理奖金。赵忠尧教授曾先后两度在美国研究原子核物理学。他是我国最早研究原子核物理的专家。在研究上有很好的成就。一九四六年他曾参观美国在比基尼岛的原子弹爆炸试验。这位热爱祖国的正义的科学家在一九五○年由美国归国途中，曾经遭受过美帝国主义的种种迫害，最后在日本被美帝国主义的特务爪牙们用镣铐拘禁在监狱里，渡过四十七天的囚徒生活。这种明目张胆的无耻迫害勾当，激起了这位原子核物理学家对美帝国主义的愤恨，同时也激起了爱好和平的人民的严正抗议。
    当我第一次到中国科学院访问时，钱三强教授正准备出发到天津去作关于原子能的通俗演讲。赵忠尧教授正在他的研究室里钻研着俄文版的苏联原子核物理学，准备和一些研究人员共同编写一本八、九万字的有关原子能科学的书。何泽慧博士也在忙着准备材料参加这本书的写作，她还计划为妇女刊物写关于原子能的通俗文章，和向妇女们作有关原子能科学知识的通俗演讲。在这次反对使用原子武器签名运动中，他们已经作过许多次演讲了。他们和许多原子科学家一样，都把自己的研究工作和保卫和平的政治斗争结合起来，使自己成为科学战线上保卫和平的坚强战士。
    三位原子核物理学家对于美帝国主义极力企图发动原子战争的罪恶阴谋，都非常愤慨。赵忠尧教授认为，美帝国主义所以阻挠原子能的和平利用，是因为他们害怕原子能的发展一旦代替了煤和石油等动力资源，美国的这一部分独占资本家们就会失去大量的利润。为了独占资本家的高额利润，他们宁愿把原子能用来屠杀亿万人民。美帝国主义是世界人民的敌人，也是科学的敌人，他们要垄断科学，拿科学为他们的利润服务，必要时他们也可以扼死科学，破坏科学。
    谈到原子武器的问题时，钱三强说：作为一个原子核物理学家，今天我要告诉人们，原子武器虽然是一种威力大、破坏性强的武器，但是它的威力绝不是像美帝国主义所宣传的那样神秘和无可防御。实际上，原子武器是可防御的，它的威力也是有一定限度的。原子弹和氢弹等可以在水中、空中、地面或地下爆炸，而以在水中爆炸的破坏力最大。在地面爆炸时，由于容易受到地面上各种物质的障碍，就会大大地减少威力。原子弹在空中爆炸时，首先出现闪目的光，接着发出雷一样的响声，在几十公里的地方可以听到，在爆炸中心很快地就变成一团火球，火球体积增大，升入高空，变成一团云。原子弹的破坏性，不外以下几个方面：第一，原子弹爆炸时会产生很高的温度，使周围的空气剧烈震荡，产生高速的波浪，形成速度每秒钟数百公尺的“冲击波”，这种冲击波可以使一公里范围内的钢筋水泥建筑物和二公里范围内的砖瓦建筑物受到破坏，距离爆炸中心七百五十公尺以内的人也会受到伤害。但是当人们发现原子弹爆炸的火光时，在一公里以外，只要马上躲到最近的掩蔽地方，就能避免这种冲击波的伤害。躲在地下室、矿井、战壕等地方，都可以防御这种冲击波。第二，原子弹爆炸时，会放出强烈的辐射光线，这种光线能使爆炸地区发生大火，能够灼伤一公里以内人体没有遮挡的部分。如果眼睛正对着原子弹的爆炸中心，也会受伤或失明。但是这种辐射光线也是可以防御的：在一公里以外，任何遮蔽物都可以遮挡这种光线。穿浅色的衣服，特别是白色的衣服，可以很有效地防御这种光线的灼伤。第三，原子弹爆炸时，会放出很强烈的肉眼看不见的能穿过很厚的物体的射线，叫做贯穿辐射，它能破坏人体的血球组织，但是这种贯穿辐射作用的时间是很短的，只有十秒到十五秒钟，一分钟后大部分就消失了。在一公里以外一般能防御冲击波的防御物，对于抵抗贯穿辐射也有足够的防御作用。第四，原子弹爆炸时，其中的铀和钚的分裂碎片向外抛散，附在尘埃上落下来，能使附近地区的许多物质都染上放射性。这些放射性物质对人体能引起放射病。但是沾染放射性的物质，是可以用仪器来检查鉴定的。鉴定以后，就可以实行隔离，使人们避免伤害。用一般防毒面具或者湿手巾掩住口鼻，也可以避免将放射性物质吸到身体中去。这些放射物百分之九十在十五分钟内即失去作用。当然，防御原子弹还有更积极的办法，就是用飞机去摧毁敌人储有原子弹的基地。同时有了现代化的防空设备，也可阻止敌人携带原子弹的飞机飞入我们的领空。
    很明显，我们的科学家是完全实事求是地去认识原子武器的，他们绝不像美帝国主义那样无耻地故意神话式地夸大原子武器的威力，用以吓唬人民，制造恐怖，借以达到他们不可告人的龌龊意图。
    钱三强着重指出：原子弹和氢弹对人口和工业非常集中的美国和英国，才真正是很大的威胁呢！而对国土广阔、人口和工业都不很集中的苏联和中国，威胁倒是相对地比较小的。只要我们有准备，美帝国主义是不能把我们怎么样的。如果它敢于发动原子战争，遭受毁灭的将必定是它自己，而不是我们和平民主阵营。
    赵忠尧和何泽慧也同样用亲身的体验，说明美帝国主义用原子武器来恐吓我们是穷极无聊的蠢事。赵忠尧教授一九四六年曾经亲自观看过美帝国主义在比基尼岛的原子弹爆炸试验。他说，美帝国主义为了宣传原子弹的威力，一九四六年曾经先后两次在比基尼岛的上空和水中进行试验爆炸。试验的结果怎样呢？恰恰证明原子弹的威力并不是不可想像的。那次美帝国主义用了七十多只目标舰船，布置在比基尼岛的西海面上，舰上装有猪、羊、鼠以及各种食物和器材等。原子弹爆炸以后，结果只炸沉大小舰船十几只，舰上的生物和食物、器材设备等损失很轻，动物平均只死了不到百分之二十。当时赵忠尧教授坐在离原子弹爆炸中心十四公里的船上观看，他坐的那只船的海面附近只起了两个浪花。
    何泽慧也谈到第二次欧洲大战期间她在德国留学时所看到的事实。她说，据科学家们计算，在二次大战期间德国境内所遭受的普通炸弹的伤害，相当于四百五十颗原子弹，这是个相当大的数目了，可是当时德国的军事生产却还不断上涨，而最后真正打垮德国法西斯军队的并不是轰炸，而是苏联红军的地面部队。
    在谈到原子能的和平利用问题时，三位原子核物理学家谈得如此亲切而感人。他们为原子能所能带给人类的幸福和美好的远景而兴奋，欢欣。他们多么热切地希望他们的伟大理想能够实现啊！也正因为这样，他们就越发憎恨那些企图把原子能用于屠杀人类的刽子手们。
    三位原子核物理学家告诉我：早在一九四九年，苏联就已经在西伯利亚的鄂毕河和叶尼塞河的水利和灌溉工程中，利用原子能的爆炸，开凿河道，使土耳其斯坦广大的沙漠变成肥沃的土地。当一九五四年六月二十七日苏联建成了世界第一座原子能发电站并开始发电以后，这个人类历史上的伟大奇迹更给人们指示了走向更幸福生活的道路。这世界第一座原子能发电站，是人类第一次不用煤和石油当燃料，不用风和水来转动涡轮，而是用人工解放出来的原子能转动涡轮发电的。它是由地下埋藏的原子堆不断供给所需要的热能。原子堆中的副产物——各种放射性同位素还可以应用在各门科学上。在医学上，苏联现在已经利用许多放射性同位素代替贵重的镭来治疗人体内的癌。而且利用放射性的钠来诊查病源和病情，利用放射性的碘治疗甲状腺病，利用放射性的磷治疗血管肿和其他皮肤病。同时，苏联已经非常普遍地在机械制造工业上利用放射性的钴来检验金属制品内部的损伤。在冶炼工业的高炉中，应用放射性的气体，可以了解这些气体在冶金炉中的活动和变化过程，帮助提高冶金的技术。苏联科学家利用放射性磷肥，已经提高了糖萝卜、马铃薯和棉花的产量。
    谈到这里，三位原子核物理学家充满着对原子时代幸福景象的信心。他们说：今天，这还只是原子时代的开端，苏联就已经在和平利用原子能方面取得了这样大的成就，将来在充分运用原子能以后，一定会创造出更美丽的图景！如果使用原子能发动飞机，那将可以做高速度和几乎无限制的远距离宇宙飞行，这种原子能发动的飞机，可以冲破地球的大气层，飞向太空，去探测别的星球上的秘密。我们也可以设想到运用原子能可以将南北极上的巨大冰块融化，使靠近两极地方的冻港不冻，冻土也变成肥沃的良田，炎热的地方也可以变成凉爽的地方，干旱的地方也可以变成湿润的地方，地球上将出现很多的大运河……。人类的智慧如果在正道上发挥起来，将会给人类自身创造出多么光辉灿烂的远景和幸福啊！
    谈起苏联在和平利用原子能方面给我国的帮助时，三位原子核物理学家更是充满着喜悦和兴奋的感情。五十多岁的赵忠尧教授洋溢着青年人的热情兴奋地说：苏联帮助我们建立实验性的原子堆，将会使我国的科学技术水平很快提高，使我国社会主义工业化的速度加快。我们有了完备的原子能科学实验中心，将大大地推进原子核物理的研究工作，进而准备原子能在生产上大规模的应用。钱三强说：作为一个原子核物理工作者，今天我们不仅要发挥我们的力量来钻研原子科学，而且要担负起培养新生力量的工作，使我国的原子科学研究工作在苏联的帮助下，迅速发展。为了使我们的科学研究工作能够在和平的环境中顺利地进行，我们必须首先坚决反对美帝国主义发动原子战争，要求严禁使用原子武器，销毁一切原子弹和氢弹。我们衷心地感谢苏联在和平利用原子能方面对我们的帮助。
