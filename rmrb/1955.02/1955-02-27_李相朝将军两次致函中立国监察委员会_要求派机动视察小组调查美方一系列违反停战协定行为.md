Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 24th: According to a report from the Korean Central News Agency in Kaesong: Senior Member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, General Li Xiangchao, sent a letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on February 23rd, requesting the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to dispatch three mobile Neutral Nations Inspection Teams to investigate the U.S. side's illegal introduction of war materials and the dispatch of military personnel to intrude into the Korean-Chinese side, in violation of the Armistice Agreement.

The letter stated: Since July 27, 1953, the United Nations Command side has violated paragraph 13(d) and other relevant provisions of the Armistice Agreement by illegally introducing war materials restricted by the Armistice Agreement, to arm the new South Korean army divisions and air force established by the United Nations Command side after July 27, 1953.

The letter further stated: Since July 27, 1953, the United Nations Command side has violated paragraphs 12, 14, and other relevant provisions of the Armistice Agreement by secretly dispatching military personnel from the United Nations Command side to intrude into areas under our military control outside the Demilitarized Zone to carry out hostile acts against our side.

The letter pointed out that the above-mentioned violations of the Armistice Agreement by the United Nations Command side occurred particularly in the vicinity of Jinhae, Pohang, Osan, near Gwangju, near Daejeon, near Sacheon, Seoul, Sokcho, Ganghwa, and Gyodong.

In the letter, General Li Xiangchao, in accordance with Article 28 of the Armistice Agreement, requested the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to dispatch three mobile Neutral Nations Inspection Teams to conduct special observation and inspection at the above-mentioned locations to investigate the aforementioned violations of the Armistice Agreement by the United Nations Command side.

The letter concluded: Our side is prepared to provide the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission with necessary witnesses, material evidence, and other intelligence regarding the aforementioned violations of the Armistice Agreement by the United Nations Command side.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 25th: According to a report from the Korean Central News Agency in Kaesong: Senior Member of the Korean-Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission, General Li Xiangchao, sent another letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on February 24th, providing supplementary materials regarding the U.S. side's violations of the Armistice Agreement mentioned in his letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission on February 23rd, in order to assist the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission in its investigation of a series of U.S. violations of the Armistice Agreement.

The letter stated: According to the statistics reported by the United Nations Command side to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, during the period from July 28, 1953, to December 31, 1954, the United Nations Command side should have "withdrawn" approximately ten divisions of military personnel from Korea and should have "shipped out" the rifles and carbines needed by more than ten divisions of troops from Korea.

In other words, when the United Nations Command side "withdrew" approximately ten divisions from Korea after the armistice, it not only could not leave their weapons in Korea but also should have shipped out a large quantity of the weapons they needed. Therefore, the newly organized South Korean army divisions and air force after the armistice prove that the United Nations Command side armed them with illegally imported war materials.

The letter further stated: Kim Song-dong (transliteration), Captain (military number 207999), Air Force Commander of the 25th Division of the 5th Corps of the United Nations Command puppet army, who revolted on February 17th, and others, have all confirmed that the United Nations Command side has recently armed the South Korean army with war materials illegally imported after the armistice. The testimonies of these witnesses prove that the United Nations Command side's illegal import of war materials after the armistice occurred particularly at the port of Jinhae and at the airfields of Pohang, Osan, Gwangju, Daejeon, and Sacheon. The letter stated: Shen Rongjun (transliteration), a United Nations Command side's agent, and many others arrested by our side, have confirmed the following facts: since the armistice, the United Nations Command side has violated the relevant provisions of the Armistice Agreement by dispatching agents to infiltrate areas under our military control outside the Demilitarized Zone to carry out hostile actions against our side. The testimonies of these witnesses prove that since the armistice, the United Nations Command side has violated the relevant provisions of the Armistice Agreement by organizing and directing agents from Seoul, Sokcho, Ganghwa, Gyodong, and other places to infiltrate areas under our military control outside the Demilitarized Zone to carry out hostile actions against our side.

The letter concluded: Our side is prepared to provide these witnesses and material evidence when the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission investigates the crimes of the United Nations Command side, and our side is also prepared to provide the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission with other further information.

    李相朝将军两次致函中立国监察委员会
    要求派机动视察小组调查美方一系列违反停战协定行为
    【新华社平壤二十四日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将在二月二十三日给中立国监察委员会一封信，要求中立国监察委员会派遣三个机动中立国视察小组调查美方非法运入作战物资和派遣军事人员侵入朝中方面的违反停战协定的行为。
  信中说：联合国军司令部方面在一九五三年七月二十七日以后，违反停战协定第十三款卯项及其他有关规定，非法运入停战协定所限制的作战物资，以武装在一九五三年七月二十七日以后由联合国军司令部方面建立的南朝鲜军队的新的师和空军。
    信中又说：联合国军司令部方面在一九五三年七月二十七日以后，违反停战协定第十二款、第十四款及其他有关规定，暗中派遣联合国军司令部方面的军事人员侵入非军事区以外的我方军事控制下的地区，对我方进行敌对行为。
    信件指出，上述联合国军司令部方面违反停战协定的行为，特别是发生在镇海、浦项、乌山附近、光州附近、大田附近、泗川附近、汉城、束草、江华、乔桐等地。
    李相朝中将在信件中根据停战协定第二十八款，要求中立国监察委员会派遣三个机动中立国视察小组到上述地点去进行特别观察与视察，调查上述联合国军方面违反停战协定的行为。
    信件最后说：我方准备向中立国监察委员会提供有关上述联合国军方面违反停战协定的必要的人证、物证和其他情报。
   【新华社平壤二十五日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社开城讯：军事停战委员会朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将二十四日又给中立国监察委员会一封信，对他在二月二十三日给中立国监察委员会的信中谈到的美方违反停战协定的情况，提供了补充材料，以便有助于中立国监察委员会对美方一系列违反停战协定的活动的调查工作。
    信件说：根据联合国军总司令部方面向中立国监察委员会报告的统计数字，在一九五三年七月二十八日到一九五四年十二月三十一日期间，联合国军总司令部方面应该已经从朝鲜“撤退”大约十个师的军事人员，并且应该已经从朝鲜“运出”十师以上军队所需用的步枪和卡宾枪。
    换句话说联合国军总司令部在停战后从朝鲜“撤退”大约十个师的时候，不仅决不能把他们的武器留在朝鲜，而且应该运出大批他们的需用量的武器。因此，联合国军总司令部方面在停战后新组织的南朝鲜陆军师和空军证明，联合国军总司令部方面是用非法输入的作战物资把它们武装起来的。
    信件又说：二月十七日起义的联合国军总司令部傀儡军第五兵团第二十五师的空军队长金松同
  （译音）大尉（军号二○七九九九）和其他的人都证实：联合国军总司令部方面最近以停战后非法输入的作战物资来武装南朝鲜的军队。这些证人所陈述的证词证明，联合国军总司令部方面在停战后非法输入作战物资的事件特别发生在镇海港口以及在浦项、乌山、光州、大田和泗川等飞机场。信件说：联合国军总司令部方面的特务申荣俊（译音）和被我方逮捕的许多其他的人都证实了这些事实：自从停战以来，联合国军总司令部方面违反停战协定的有关规定，派遣特务潜入非军事区以外的我方军事控制下的地区，对我方进行敌对行动。这些证人的作证证明，停战以后，联合国军总司令部方面违反停战协定的有关条款，从汉城、束草、江华、乔桐等地组织和指挥特务潜入非军事区以外的我方军事控制下的地区，对我方进行敌对行动。
    信件最后说：我方准备在中立国监察委员会调查联合国军总司令部方面的罪行时提供这些人证和物证，我方并且准备向中立国监察委员会提供其它的进一步的情况。
