Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, February 22nd: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Akahata," published on the 14th a speech by Kasuga Shoichi, Chairman of the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party, on the Japanese Communist Party's election policy.

Kasuga Shoichi said: This general election is of great significance because it is a general election won by the power of the people.

Kasuga Shoichi pointed out: In this election, the people first demand a comprehensive liquidation of the policies of the Yoshida Cabinet and the American occupation policy. This policy has made Japan completely subordinate to the United States, subjecting Japan's politics, economy, culture, and people's lives to American interference and oppression, making it impossible for Japan's economy and culture to develop freely. Not only that, but in order to carry out aggression in Asia, the United States has turned Japan into a military base and forced Japan to implement rearmament.

Kasuga Shoichi said: The Japanese Communist Party firmly opposes this policy and demands that the politics and diplomacy subordinate to the United States be transformed into independent and autonomous politics and diplomacy. This is also the unanimous demand of the people. In order to realize the urgent demands of the people, it is first necessary to oppose all unequal treaties concluded with the United States, eliminate American interference, so that Japan can stand on an independent and autonomous position, restore diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union, interact with all countries, and carry out free trade. This is not only to save Japan from economic difficulties, but also the first step towards achieving Japan's independence. At the same time, this is also a solid path to consolidating peace and friendship between Asian countries and Japan.

Kasuga Shoichi talked about the Hatoyama Cabinet's policy of attempting to revise the Constitution and openly rearm. He said: Revising the Constitution and openly rearming means throwing the Japanese people into the danger of war, which threatens world peace. The Communist Party calls on the people of the whole country to unite to oppose and smash this dangerous policy and drastically reduce the cost of rearmament, using it for social welfare undertakings.

Kasuga Shoichi finally called on the people of the whole country to unite, resolutely break through the opposition of the United States and Japanese reactionaries, and advance towards the goal of striving for independence, peace, and a stable national life.

    春日正一就日本共产党竞选政策发表演说
    号召日本人民团结一致争取日本的独立和自主
    【新华社二十二日讯】东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”在十四日刊载了日本共产党中央指导部主席春日正一关于日本共产党竞选政策的演说。
    春日正一说：这次大选有很重大的意义，因为它是由人民的力量所获得的大选。
    春日正一指出：在这次大选中，人民首先要求全面地清算吉田内阁的政策和美国的占领政策。这种政策使日本完全隶属于美国，使日本的政治、经济、文化和人民生活各方面都受到美国的干涉和压迫，使得日本的经济和文化不能自由发展。不仅如此，美国为了在亚洲进行侵略，把日本变成了军事基地，并且强迫日本实行重整军备。
    春日正一说：日本共产党坚决反对这种政策，要求把隶属于美国的政治和外交转变为独立自主的政治和外交。这也是人民一致的要求。为了实现人民的迫切要求，首先要反对同美国缔结的一切不平等条约，排除美国的干涉，使日本能够站在独立自主的立场，同中、苏两国恢复邦交，和一切国家来往并进行自由贸易。这不仅是挽救日本经济困难，也是达到日本的独立的第一步。同时，这也是巩固亚洲各国和日本的和平与友好的稳固的道路。
    春日正一谈到了鸠山内阁企图修改宪法、公开重整军备的政策。他说；修改宪法和公开重整军备，就是把日本人民投入战争的危险中，就是威胁世界和平。共产党号召全国人民一致反对和粉碎这种危险的政策，大量削减重整军备的费用，把它用于社会福利事业方面。
    春日正一最后号召全国人民团结一致，坚决冲破美国和日本反动分子的反对，朝着争取独立、和平和安定国民生活的目标前进。
