    Taiwan Is Indispensable to China's Security
    Jiang Yuanchun
    Recently, the American aggressor group has increasingly liked to describe its bandit behavior of seizing our country's territory of Taiwan and armed interference in China's internal affairs as being for the sake of American security. The U.S. government's special message said this. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson also said this on January 30.
    People have to ask, why does America's security need to be guaranteed on Chinese territory more than five thousand miles away from America? Why can't the Chinese people liberate their own territory to ensure their own security? People have to ask: Is it China that is threatening the United States? Or is it the United States that is threatening China?
    The United States insists that the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan threatens American security. This statement cannot deceive anyone. Taiwan has always been Chinese territory and not American territory. It is separated from the United States by an entire Pacific Ocean. It belongs entirely to China. Even the U.S. State Department admitted in its December 23, 1949 policy statement on Taiwan that Taiwan is part of China. The Chinese people's liberation of their own territory of Taiwan does not threaten anyone, let alone threaten the security of the United States, which is located on the other side of the Pacific. Moreover, the Chinese people have not occupied any American territory, like the United States occupying Taiwan; China has also not sent its naval and air forces to the west coast of the United States to carry out war provocations, as the United States has done along the Chinese coast to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan.
    Therefore, the claim that Taiwan is necessary for American security is completely untenable. The United States uses America's "security" as an excuse and America's strategic interests as an excuse to seize other countries' territories. This is blatant aggression. Here, America's so-called "security" is actually synonymous with aggression. The "Swiss Newspaper" clearly pointed this out in a recent editorial. It said: "The United States declares that Taiwan is indispensable to its security. This practice is to occupy the territory that was promised to be returned to China." In fact, this territory has been recovered by China since October 1945. Even the American commentator Lippmann, who is entirely concerned with the interests of American imperialism, said, "For strategic reasons, we naturally have the unilateral right to interfere in foreign territories... Strictly speaking, this is called militarism."
    British Labour Party leader Attlee was right when he said at a meeting of the Labour Party parliamentary group on January 27. He said, "Taiwan is part of China, and it cannot become an outpost of American defense."
    It should be pointed out that Taiwan is the outpost of China's national defense and a strategic island shielding China's southeastern coast. It is indispensable to ensuring China's security. The United States now wants to turn China's defense outpost into its aggression outpost. This proves that its occupation of Taiwan is not for America's so-called "security," but to threaten China's security and prepare for a war of aggression against China.
    The U.S. Information Service's "background material" on the U.S. government's war message also clearly stated that the U.S. occupation of Taiwan is aimed at subverting China. This subversion activity takes the form of internal and external collusion. The "background material" assigns the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique a "long-term task of exerting influence on the situation," creating "division" and "riots" within China, and playing "perhaps a decisive role" when such "factors" occur, in order to "unify" China. Doesn't this also prove that the U.S. occupation of Taiwan seriously threatens China's security?
    While stepping up subversive activities within China, the United States is also actively carrying out war preparations around China, and Taiwan is one of the most important aggressive bases in the hands of the United States. Opening a map of Asia, you can see how seriously the American military bases in Asia have threatened China's security. In the northeast of China, the United States has turned Japan and South Korea into its military bases. In the southeast of China, the United States is trying to turn South Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia into American "fortresses." In the east of China, the United States has constructed a so-called "island chain." Every American base on these islands threatens China's security, and Taiwan is one of the most prominent bases. From these island bases, the U.S. Navy and Air Force are carrying out war provocations on the Chinese coast. It is precisely with these island bases as capital that the U.S. government's war message clamors to arbitrarily expand military operations to invade China.
    All these facts fully prove that it is the United States that has seriously threatened China, and China has not threatened the United States. The United States must get out of Taiwan and Penghu, Chinese territories more than five thousand miles away from its borders, and China must liberate its own territories to ensure the security of its motherland. This is the unwavering determination of the Chinese people.

    台湾是中国安全所不可缺少的
    蒋元椿
    最近，美国侵略集团越来越喜欢把它强占我国领土台湾、武装干涉中国内政的强盗行为说成是为了美国的安全。美国政府的特别咨文这样说。美国助理国务卿罗伯逊在一月三十日也这样说。
    人们要问，美国的安全为什么要到离美国五千多英哩以外的中国的领土上来保障？为什么中国人民不可以解放自己的领土来保障自己的安全？人们要问：究竟是中国威胁了美国？还是美国威胁了中国？
    美国硬说中国人民解放台湾威胁了美国的安全，这种说法是骗不了任何人的。台湾从来就是中国的领土而不是美国的领土。它和美国隔着整整一个太平洋。它完全是属于中国的。就是美国国务院也在一九四九年十二月二十三日关于台湾的政策宣传指示中承认过，台湾是中国的一部分。中国人民解放自己的领土台湾，威胁不到任何人，当然更谈不到威胁远在太平洋彼岸的美国的安全。而且中国人民并没有侵占美国的任何领土，像美国侵占台湾那样；中国也并没有把自己的海空军派到美国的西海岸去进行战争挑衅，就像美国为了阻挠中国人民解放台湾而在中国沿海所做的那样。
    因此，所谓台湾对于美国的安全是必要的这种说法，是完全站不住脚的。美国以美国的“安全”为借口，以美国的战略利益为借口，侵占别国的领土，这就是明目张胆的侵略行为。在这里，美国的所谓“安全”，实际上就是侵略的同义语。“瑞士报”在它最近的一篇社论中清楚地指出了这一点。它说：“美国宣布台湾对它的安全是不可缺少的，这种作法就是要占有曾经答应交给中国的领土。”事实上这片领土自一九四五年十月起就已经由中国收回。甚至完全为美国帝国主义的利益打算的美国评论家李普曼也说，“为了战略的理由，我们就理所当然地有干涉外国领土的片面权利……确切说来，这就叫军国主义。”
    英国工党领袖艾德礼一月二十七日在工党议会党团的会议上说得对。他说，“台湾是中国的一部分，它不能成为美国防务的前哨。”
    应该指出：台湾是中国国防的前哨，是屏障中国东南沿海的战略岛屿。它是保障中国的安全所不可缺少的。美国现在要把中国的国防前哨变成它的侵略前哨，这就证明它侵占台湾并不是为了美国的什么“安全”，而是为了威胁中国的安全，准备侵略中国的战争。
    美国新闻处发表的关于美国政府战争咨文的“背景材料”，还明白地表示美国侵占台湾的目的是为了颠覆中国。这种颠覆活动采取的是里应外合的手段。“背景材料”指定给蒋介石卖国集团一个“长期的任务，就是对局势施展影响”，在中国内部制造“分裂”、“暴动”，并且在这种“因素”发生的时候“发挥也许带有决定性的作用”，以便
  “统一”中国。这难道不也证明了美国侵占台湾是严重地威胁中国的安全的吗？
    与在中国内部加紧进行颠覆活动的同时，美国还积极在中国周围进行战争准备，而台湾就是美国手中的最重要的侵略基地之一。打开亚洲的地图就可以看到，美国在亚洲的军事基地已经对中国的安全形成了怎样严重的威胁。在中国的东北方，美国把日本和南朝鲜变成了它的军事基地。在中国的东南方，美国正在企图把南越、老挝和柬埔寨变成为美国的“堡垒”。在中国的东方，美国构筑了一条所谓“岛屿锁链”。在这些岛屿上的每一个美国基地都是威胁着中国的安全的，而台湾就是其中最突出的一个基地。从这些岛屿基地上，美国的海空军正在中国沿海进行战争挑衅。也正是以这些岛屿基地作为资本，美国政府的战争咨文中叫嚣要任意扩大侵略中国的军事行动。
    以上这些事实完全证明：是美国严重地威胁了中国，而中国并没有威胁美国。美国必须从离它国境五千多英哩以外的中国领土台湾澎湖滚出去，而中国则必须解放自己的这些领土来保障自己祖国的安全。这就是中国人民坚定不移的决心。
