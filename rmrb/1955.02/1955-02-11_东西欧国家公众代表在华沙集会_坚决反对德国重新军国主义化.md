    Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 9th: According to the Polish Press Agency in Warsaw: Delegations from various countries that participated in the European Conference for a Peaceful Settlement of the German Question held in Paris last December, along with delegations from the Soviet Union and Eastern European People's Democratic Countries who were unable to attend the Paris Conference due to the French government's refusal to issue entry visas, held a meeting in Warsaw on the 6th and 7th. Participating in the meeting were fifty-one representatives from Albania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Switzerland. After a frank and sincere discussion, the meeting unanimously adopted a communiqué summarizing the agreements reached on a number of fundamental issues.

    The communiqué stated that the representatives attending the meeting once again unanimously and resolutely opposed any form of German remilitarization. Representatives from Eastern European countries emphasized that, due to the loss of life and property suffered by their countries, no one among their people could agree to the recurrence of such events.

    The communiqué said that the meeting participants, after listening to the speeches of the Soviet representatives, concluded that the ratification of the Paris and London Agreements would undoubtedly destroy the concept of consultation and mutual understanding.

    The communiqué stated that the meeting participants unanimously declared that the occupying countries could now reach an understanding on a number of issues, including: the simultaneous withdrawal of all occupying forces from Germany; the unification of Germany through free and supervised elections; and respecting the obligations stipulated in the Potsdam Agreement, with Germany not participating in any military alliances.

    东西欧国家公众代表在华沙集会
    坚决反对德国重新军国主义化
    【新华社九日讯】据波兰通讯社华沙讯：参加去年十二月在巴黎举行的争取和平解决德国问题欧洲会议的各国代表团，会同因法国政府拒发入境签证而未能参加巴黎会议的苏联和东欧人民民主国家代表团，在六日和七日在华沙举行会议。参加会议的有阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、捷克斯洛伐克、丹麦、芬兰、法国、德国、希腊、荷兰、匈牙利、意大利、波兰、罗马尼亚、苏联和瑞士的五十一个代表。会议经过了坦白和诚恳的讨论，一致通过了一项公报，总结了会议在一些基本问题上达成的协议。
    公报说，参加会议的代表们再一次一致地和坚决地反对任何形式的德国重新军国主义化，东欧国家代表强调指出，由于他们国家所受到的生命和物质损失，这些国家的人民中间没有人能够同意再发生这样的事件。
    公报说，会议参加者在听取了苏联代表的发言后得出结论，批准巴黎和伦敦协定的结果无疑地将毁灭协商和互相谅解的观念。
    公报说，会议参加者一致声明，占领国家间现在就可以就一些问题达成谅解，其中包括：同时从德国撤退所有占领军；通过自由和有监督的选举来统一德国；尊重波茨坦协定规定的义务，德国不参加任何军事联盟。
