Tianjin's Industrial Hygiene Work
Tianjin Municipal Public Health Bureau

In 1954, Tianjin's industrial hygiene work achieved new development, workers' health conditions gradually improved, and the absentee rate due to illness and the work-related injury rate in various factories and enterprises began to decline. For example, in factories under the Textile Industry Bureau system, the absentee rate due to illness from January to September 1953 was 5.76 percent, which decreased to 3.41 percent during the same period last year; the disease-related absentee rate at the Metrology Factory in November last year was only 0.35 percent. The work-related injury rate in various construction sites under the Construction Engineering Bureau system was 3.19 percent in the second quarter of 1953, compared to 2.19 percent in the same quarter last year; the percentage of female workers with menstrual disorders at State-owned Cotton Mill No. 3 decreased from 42 percent in the first quarter of 1953 to 15.7 percent in the same quarter last year. The following is a discussion of our preliminary experiences and understandings in carrying out industrial hygiene work.

Gradually Implement Unified Management of Industrial Hygiene Work

Tianjin's urban medical and preventive work is basically for the service of workers. However, in recent years, due to our failure to make unified and reasonable arrangements for urban medical and preventive work, many problems still exist. First, the distribution of medical resources is uneven. Tianjin's medical institutions are mostly concentrated in the central urban area, such as District 5, which has an average of 7.4 beds per thousand people, while the peripheral areas with more factories, such as District 8, have no beds at all. Medical personnel with relatively high technical levels are mostly concentrated in municipal hospitals, while medical personnel in factory medical institutions generally have lower levels. Second, due to the long-term decentralized management of hospitals by various factories and enterprises, technical conditions are poor, and potential cannot be realized. For example, the outpatient volume of a military supply unit's employee hospital and the Municipal Industrial Bureau Hospital only used one-quarter of their capacity, and one-fifth of the beds were vacant. Third, various factories and hospitals have special agreements, but they are mostly spontaneous and freely combined, and the relationships are very chaotic. Fourth, medical cadres still underestimate preventive work, lack sufficient understanding of the principle of "serving production," and treatment and prevention remain disconnected.

To change this situation, we are required to implement the spirit of the First National Industrial Hygiene Conference resolution and make thorough reconsideration of urban medical and preventive work. We are required to gradually unify planning and change the unbalanced distribution and development of medical institutions, fully utilize the strength of medical institutions at all levels, and earnestly serve production. Therefore, we focused on District 3 and piloted a three-tiered medical and preventive system for factories, organically linking the medical resources of factories and municipal hospitals based on the distribution of factories and enterprises and medical technical conditions. Larger factories with medical institutions were designated as the third tier, Municipal First and Second Hospitals in the district were designated as the second tier, and the Municipal General Hospital was designated as the first tier, establishing a three-tiered relationship, with each level responsible for its own area and rationally using the medical resources of each level. Since the implementation of this system, the results have been good. It has not only brought into play the role of factory medical institutions and made it much easier for workers to see a doctor, but also reduced the burden on hospitals, enabling them to calmly solve difficult and complicated cases. After hospital medical personnel went down to the factories, they also clearly recognized the political significance of serving production and serving the workers, became familiar with the production process, understood the causes of illness, and improved the level of medical work.

In the process of gradually promoting the three-tiered medical and preventive system for factories, we realized that the balanced distribution of medical resources and the mutual cooperation of medical institutions at all levels are the main conditions for doing this work well. Therefore, we carried out the following tasks: First, we established and adjusted the special agreements between factories, construction sites, and hospitals. We started with District 7, assisting an employee hospital in establishing special agreements with 22 factories in District 7, and supplementing them with medical cadres and strengthening their technical force. The establishment of this relationship not only solved the medical problems of workers in nearby factories, but also brought into play the potential strength of the hospital. Now, the hospital's bed occupancy rate has increased by 43 percent compared to the past, and the outpatient volume has also doubled. Second, we gradually adjusted the leadership relationships. According to the instructions of higher authorities, we took over the Municipal Industrial Bureau Hospital, starting with managing business, personnel, and finance, to create experience for unified management. After taking over the hospital, its original medical tasks were distributed to the hospitals in the respective districts according to the area. Third, we organized and utilized social medical resources, especially the strength of traditional Chinese medicine. Some factory and enterprise medical institutions have now begun to invite traditional Chinese medicine practitioners for consultations, and some factories have established medical relationships with traditional Chinese medicine clinics. We also widely utilized the grassroots forces of medical stations and joint clinics in various districts to solve the medical problems of workers in small and medium-sized factories.

In order to implement the policy of unified management, bring into play the strength of medical and preventive institutions at all levels, and better serve production, we plan to establish hospitals and outpatient departments in districts lacking medical institutions in the future to solve the problem of uneven distribution of medical and preventive institutions, while supplementing the hospitals in areas where factories are concentrated but medical resources are weak; bring into play the strength of traditional Chinese medicine and establish and improve grassroots medical and preventive institutions. We also plan to gradually expand the implementation of the three-tiered medical and preventive system for factories.

Continue to Carry out the Patriotic Health Campaign, Prevent and Control Common and Occupational Diseases

In 1953, we carried out the patriotic health campaign in factories in the form of launching safety and hygiene campaigns. This changed the sanitary conditions of factories, improved workers' knowledge of hygiene, and promoted the attention of leading cadres to hygiene work, laying the foundation for carrying out hygiene work in factories. However, it is inappropriate to adopt the form of launching campaigns in production units for a long time, and the patriotic health campaign must be led to regularization. Therefore, at different times and in different seasons, we propose different tasks and different requirements, rely on mass health organizations to carry out in-depth publicity, and then combine with production and the masses' lives to mobilize workers to do regular hygiene work well. On the basis of doing a good job in general hygiene and epidemic prevention work, we will further solve the problems of common and occupational diseases that affect workers' health in life and production.

The basic measure to reduce gastrointestinal infectious diseases is to improve food hygiene. We require each factory and construction site to equip full-time cadres to be responsible for canteen hygiene work to prevent food poisoning and gastrointestinal diseases. In order to improve canteen hygiene work, we held a canteen hygiene work conference, held a canteen hygiene work exhibition, and organized more than 3,000 cooks from public and private factories and construction sites in the city to participate in hygiene training. We conducted education on love for the profession for the cooks, encouraged their enthusiasm, and generally improved the hygiene work and food quality of the canteens of various factories and construction sites. In order to make canteen hygiene work more in-depth and regular, we formulated interim regulations on canteen hygiene based on mass experience and submitted them to 28 factories for trial implementation. We also mobilized all cooks to participate in labor competitions. As of the end of November last year, 289 factories and construction site canteens had participated in the competition. At the end of last year, we selected nine model canteens and four individual models for cooks and administrators, which played a great role in improving canteen hygiene. Due to the improvement of food hygiene work, gastrointestinal diseases and infectious diseases in factories and construction sites decreased significantly last year, further guaranteeing the health of employees.

In terms of construction site hygiene, we jointly conducted safety and hygiene inspections before construction began with relevant departments such as the Red Cross and the Labor Bureau, assisted the Construction Engineering Bureau in rectifying the medical and health institutions at the construction sites, and improved and established mass hygiene first-aid organizations.

In terms of preventing and controlling occupational diseases, we mainly focused on solving problems such as high temperature, dust, and toxic substances. According to a survey in mid-July last year, 80 percent of the problems in public and private factories with high-temperature workshops had been solved. The temperature in the workshops has generally decreased. For example, after adding a water curtain to the furnace door of the Telecommunications Equipment Factory, the temperature dropped by 50 degrees Celsius, workers no longer had production intervals, and the output increased by an average of 8 percent. The reason why the cooling work was done relatively well was mainly because under the leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Health Bureau, the Labor Bureau, and the Trade Union formed a unified core leadership force to command the city's cooling work, relied on the workers, and paid attention to timely summarizing and exchanging mass experience. Last year, we conducted investigations in 103 larger factories and made classified summaries. Relatively mature experiences were exchanged through professional meetings. In addition, learning from the lessons of the previous year and making preparations in advance was also an important factor.

Focus on Piloting the Health Supervision System

We have initially carried out health supervision work. We reviewed the site selection and other aspects of newly built and expanded factories such as the First Processing Factory of the Food Company, Tianjin Oil Felt Factory, Donglai Artificial Wood Factory, Northern Chemical Factory, Alloy Factory, Kemin Chemical Factory, and Dagu Chemical Factory; for food factories, such as canning factories, First and Second Food Processing Factories, we assisted them in establishing health management systems and supervised their cleaning, hygiene, and disinfection work; helped 19 factories and construction sites without running water to carry out drinking water disinfection, ensuring the drinking water hygiene of more than 52,000 workers in these factories and construction sites. We also carried out supervision and management of phenomena that endanger the public health of residents. For example, we supervised and assisted in improving the problem of the North China Logistics Tannery discharging wastewater into the Haihe River, which affected the drinking water hygiene of downstream residents, and the problems of dust from power plants and chemical gases discharged by the North China Chemical Factory and Hongyu Chemical Factory polluting the atmosphere; we also inspected construction sites before construction began according to the temporary construction hygiene standards, laying a good foundation for this year's construction site hygiene work.

Although not much health supervision work has been done, it has played a significant role. In the future, we need to systematically and proactively carry out health supervision work, summarize the existing experience, and formulate a set of specific and feasible health supervision regulations.

Strengthen the Leadership of Industrial Hygiene Work

The strengthening of the Party committee's leadership over industrial hygiene work is the fundamental reason why our work has made new progress. The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China attaches importance to industrial hygiene work. At the city's safety and hygiene conference, the Municipal Committee clearly stipulated that factory and enterprise units should include safety and hygiene work as one of the competition indicators, and give the same awards for safety and hygiene rationalization proposals and production rationalization proposals; it also stipulated that one day a month is a safety and hygiene activity day, providing a guarantee for safety and hygiene work in all aspects. The Minister of Industry of the Municipal Committee also gave important instructions at the canteen hygiene work conference and the industrial hygiene conference, and made ideological mobilization to the Party organizations of factories and enterprise units, requiring them to strengthen ideological leadership over medical personnel and discuss safety and hygiene work regularly. The Municipal Committee also determined that the health department can send people to participate in the factory enterprise production meetings convened by the Municipal Committee and provide opinions. At the same time, it also issued instructions to factories and construction sites on strengthening safety and hygiene work regularly according to the situation and checked the implementation. The Party organizations of various districts and enterprise units also strengthened their leadership over industrial hygiene work. They examined their own shortcomings and helped medical personnel improve their ideological awareness.

Last year, we also paid attention to strengthening ideological leadership and technical guidance for medical personnel. In the process of conveying and organizing the study of the resolutions of the Third National Health Administration Conference, we criticized the tendency of medical personnel to neglect politics. The Minister of Industry of the Municipal Committee also criticized the bourgeois erroneous thoughts existing among medical personnel in the report of the industrial hygiene conference, so that they recognized their mistakes and clearly recognized the relationship between politics and technology. At the same time, administrative leaders also realized that to bring into play the enthusiasm of medical personnel, we must strengthen political and ideological leadership. In order to improve the technical level of medical personnel in factories and enterprises, we organized responsible physicians and responsible health administrative cadres in factories and enterprises to systematically study Soviet labor hygiene and improved their professional level. For example, after studying labor hygiene, the physicians of the Ninth Rubber Factory and Jinan Tannery studied the factory's hygiene facilities and proposed suggestions for improving local ventilation equipment. Experience has proved that organizing technical learning should become one of the main contents of technical guidance work.

In terms of organization and leadership, we supplemented the specialized management institutions for industrial hygiene work and expanded the Industrial Hygiene Section into the Industrial Hygiene Division. This not only facilitates timely understanding of the situation, solving problems, and training cadres, but also facilitates determining unified plans with other departments and preventing the occurrence of multiple factory visits and hindering production. Because labor protection work and industrial hygiene work are inextricably linked, last year we also widely adopted the method of forming joint working groups with relevant departments to jointly do a good job in industrial hygiene work. For example, when conducting dust and toxic substance investigations and research, we formed a working group with the Labor Bureau and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions; when doing canteen hygiene work, we formed a working group with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions. In various districts, the district health section, labor protection section, and district trade union jointly formed a working group. This facilitates unifying thought, unifying plans, unifying strength, and unifying inspection. Last year, the division of labor in industrial hygiene leadership at the municipal and district levels was that the Municipal Health Bureau was responsible for the industrial hygiene work of state-owned and public factories and construction sites, and the district health section was responsible for the hygiene work of private factories. The advantage of this division of labor is that each has its own focus and its strength can be brought into play. This has been proven in practice.

In the past year, Tianjin's industrial hygiene work has taken another step forward. However, there are still many shortcomings. For example, sufficient attention has not been paid to the medical and health work of heavy industry and national defense industry; the work is still not in-depth, lacking detailed investigation and research, and not good at or timely in summarizing experience; it has not yet organized and utilized all medical resources to serve production. In the future, under the unified leadership of the Party committee, we will further rely on the masses, strengthen political and ideological leadership, comprehensively implement the three-tiered medical and preventive system for factories, gradually promote the workshop physician system, better organize medical resources to serve production, vigorously solve the problem of dust and toxic substances, continue to cultivate and improve the professional level of cadres, and focus on establishing and improving health organizations in large factories with conditions, and gradually carry out health supervision work.

    天津市的工业卫生工作
    天津市公共卫生局
    一九五四年，天津市的工业卫生工作有了新的发展，工人的健康状况逐步得到改善，各工厂企业因病缺勤率和工伤率已经开始降低。例如：纺织工业管理局系统的工厂，一九五三年一月至九月因病缺勤率是百分之五点七六，去年同时期降低到百分之三点四一；度量衡工厂去年十一月的疾病缺勤率只有百分之零点三五。建筑工程局系统各工地一九五三年第二季度工伤率是百分之三点一九，去年同季度则是百分之二点一九；国棉三厂女工月经病患者一九五三年第一季度是百分之四十二，去年同季度降到百分之十五点七。下面谈谈我们开展工业卫生工作的初步经验和体会。
    逐步地实行工业卫生工作的统一管理
    天津市的城市医疗预防工作基本上是为工人服务的。但这几年来，由于我们没有把城市医疗预防工作作统一合理的安排，以致还存在着不少问题。首先是医疗力量分布不平衡。天津市的医疗机构多集中在市中心区，如五区，每千人平均有七点四张病床，而工厂较多的边缘区，如八区，则一张病床也没有。技术水平比较高的医务人员大多集中在市立医院，工厂医疗机构中的医务人员一般水平较低。其次，由于各工厂企业单位医院长期分散自理，技术条件较差，潜力不能发挥。如一个军需单位的职工医院和市工业局医院的门诊量仅使用了四分之一，有五分之一的床位空着。第三，各工厂和医院都有特约关系，但多是自发的和自由的结合，关系非常紊乱。第四、医务干部仍轻视预防工作，对“面向生产”的原则认识不足，治疗和预防仍然脱节。
    要改变这种状况，就要求我们贯彻第一届全国工业卫生会议决议的精神，对城市医疗预防工作，重新作周密的考虑。要求我们逐步地统一计划和规划，改变医疗机构分布不平衡和发展不平衡的状态，充分发挥各级医疗机构的力量，切实作到为生产服务。因此，我们以三区为重点，试行了工厂三级医疗预防制，按工厂企业单位分布情况和医疗技术条件，把工厂的医疗力量和市立医院有机地联系起来。以有医疗机构的较大的工厂作为第三级，以该区的市立第一和第二医院为第二级，以市立总医院为第一级，建立了三级关系，逐级负责，合理地使用各级的医疗力量。这一制度试行以来，效果良好。不仅发挥了工厂医疗机构的作用，工人看病较前大大方便，而且减轻了医院的负担，使它们能够从容地解决疑难病症问题。医院的医务人员下厂以后，也明确认识了面向生产、为工人服务的政治意义，熟悉了生产过程，了解了发病原因，提高了医疗工作的水平。
    在逐步推行工厂三级医疗预防制的过程中，我们体会到，医疗力量分布的平衡，各级医疗机构的相互配合，是作好这一工作的主要条件。因而我们又进行了以下几项工作：首先是建立和调整工厂、工地和医院的特约关系。我们先从七区着手，协助一个职工医院和七区二十二个工厂建立了特约关系，并为他们充实了医务干部，加强了技术力量。这一关系的建立，不仅解决了附近工厂工人的医疗问题，而且也发挥了该院的潜在力量。现在，该院病床利用率较前提高了百分之四十三，门诊量也较过去增加一倍。其次，逐步地调整了领导关系，根据上级的指示，我们接管了市工业局医院，从管业务、管人事、管财务着手，为统一管理创造经验。在接管该院以后，将其原担负之医疗任务，按地区分配给所在地区的各个医院。第三，组织和发挥社会医疗力量，特别是发挥中医的力量。现在有些工厂企业单位的医疗机构，已开始请中医会诊，有的工厂则和中医诊所建立了医疗关系。我们还广泛地利用了各区的医疗站和联合诊所等基层力量，解决了中小型工厂工人的医疗问题。
    为了贯彻统一管理的方针，发挥各级医疗预防机构的力量，更好地为生产服务，今后我们打算在缺乏医疗机构的区建立医院和门诊部，以解决医疗预防机构分布不平衡的问题，同时充实工厂集中而医疗力量薄弱的地区的医院；发挥中医力量，建立和健全基层医疗预防机构。并计划逐步扩大推行工厂三级医疗预防制。
    继续开展爱国卫生运动，防治多发病和职业病
    一九五三年，我们在工厂中采取开展安全卫生运动的形式开展了爱国卫生运动。改变了工厂卫生状况，提高了工人的卫生知识水平，并促使了领导干部对卫生工作的重视，为在工厂中进行卫生工作打下了基础。但是，在生产单位里长期采取搞运动的形式是不相宜的，必须把爱国卫生运动引向经常化。因此，在不同时期、不同季节，我们提出不同的任务、不同的要求，依靠群众卫生组织进行深入宣传，然后结合生产，结合群众生活，发动工人作好经常性的卫生工作。在搞好一般卫生防疫工作的基础上，进一步解决在生活中、生产中影响工人健康的多发病和职业病的问题。
    减少胃肠传染病的基本措施在于搞好饮食卫生。我们要求各工厂、工地，配备专职干部负责食堂卫生工作，防止食物中毒和胃肠病。为了把食堂卫生工作提高一步，我们召开了食堂卫生工作会议，举办了食堂卫生工作展览会，并组织全市公私营工厂和工地的三千多名炊事员，参加卫生训练，对炊事员进行了热爱职业的教育，鼓舞了炊事员的积极性，使各工厂、工地食堂的卫生工作、饮食质量普遍地有了改进。为了使食堂卫生工作更深入、经常，我们根据群众经验拟订了食堂卫生暂行规则，交二十八个工厂试行，并发动全体炊事员投入劳动竞赛，截至去年十一月底，有二百八十九个工厂、工地的食堂参加了竞赛。去年年终，我们评出了九个模范食堂，和四个炊事员和管理员个人模范，对搞好食堂卫生起了很大的作用。由于饮食卫生工作的改进，去年工厂、工地中胃肠病、传染病显著减少，进一步保证了职工的健康。
    在工地卫生方面，我们和红十字会、劳动局等有关部门共同进行了开工前的安全卫生检查，协助建筑工程局整顿了工地医疗卫生机构，健全和建立了群众性的卫生急救组织。
    在防治职业病方面，我们主要的是着手解决高温、粉尘、毒物等问题。根据去年七月中旬的调查，有高温车间的公私营工厂，百分之八十的问题已得到解决。车间温度普遍下降。例如，电讯器材厂炉门增加水幕后，温度降低了五十度，工人不再有生产的间歇时间，产量平均提高了百分之八。降温工作之所以作得比较好，主要是在中共天津市委领导下，卫生局、劳动局和工会组成了统一指挥全市降温工作的核心领导力量，依靠工人，注意及时总结和交流群众经验。去年，我们在一百零三个较大的工厂中进行了调查工作，并作了分类总结，对于比较成熟的经验并通过专业会议进行了交流。此外，吸取前年的教训，提前做好了准备工作，也是一个重要因素。
    重点试行卫生监督制
    我们初步开展了卫生监督工作，我们对食品公司第一加工厂、天津油毡厂、东来人造木板厂、北方化学厂、合金工厂、科明化学厂、大沽化工厂等新建及扩建工厂，在选择厂址等方面，进行了审核；对于食品工厂，例如罐头厂、第一、二食品加工厂，协助其建立了卫生管理制度，监督其进行清洁卫生和消毒工作；帮助十九处没有自来水的工厂工地进行了饮水消毒，保证了这些工厂工地中五万二千多工人的饮水卫生。对于妨害居民公共卫生的现象也进行了监督管理。例如华北后勤制革厂废水排入海河，影响下游居民饮水卫生；发电厂的灰尘，华北化工厂和宏豫化工厂排出的化学气体污染大气等问题，我们都进行了督促检查并协助其改进；对于建筑工地，在开工前根据暂设工程卫生标准也进行了检查，为今年工地卫生工作打下了良好基础。
    卫生监督工作虽然作得还不多，但已发生很大的作用。今后须要系统地主动地开展卫生监督工作，把已有的经验加以总结，拟定出一套具体可行的卫生监督条例。
    加强工业卫生工作的领导
    党委对于工业卫生工作领导的加强，是我们的工作有了新的开展的根本原因。中共天津市委会对于工业卫生工作是重视的。在全市安全卫生会议上，市委明确规定了工厂企业单位应把安全卫生工作列为竞赛指标之一，对安全卫生合理化建议和生产合理化建议同样给予奖励；并且还规定了每月有一天是安全卫生活动日，从各方面给安全卫生工作以制度上的保证。市委工业部长还在食堂卫生工作会议和工业卫生会议上，作了重要指示，并向工厂企业单位党的组织作了思想动员，要求他们加强对医务人员的思想领导，定期讨论安全卫生工作。市委还确定卫生部门可以派人参加市委召开的工厂企业生产会议，并提供意见。同时还根据情况定期地向工厂工地发出加强安全卫生工作的指示，并检查执行的情况。各区、各企业单位党的组织也加强了对工业卫生工作的领导，他们检查了自己的缺点，并帮助医务人员提高思想觉悟程度。
    去年，我们也注意了加强对医务人员的思想领导和技术指导。在传达和组织学习第三届全国卫生行政会议决议的过程中，我们批判了医务人员忽视政治的倾向。市委工业部长在工业卫生会议的报告中也针对医务人员中存在的资产阶级错误思想进行了批判，使他们认识到自己的错误，明确认识了政治和技术的关系。同时，使行政领导干部也认识到，要发挥医务人员的积极性，必须加强政治思想领导。为了提高工厂企业医务人员的技术水平，我们组织工厂企业负责医师和负责的卫生行政干部，系统地学习了苏联劳动卫生学，提高了业务水平。如第九橡胶厂和津南制革厂的医师们经过劳动卫生学的学习后，便研究了厂内的卫生设置情况，提出了改善局部通风装置的建议。经验证明，组织技术学习，应成为技术指导工作中的主要内容之一。
    在组织领导方面，我们充实了工业卫生工作的专管机构，将工业卫生科扩大为工业卫生处。这不仅便于及时了解情况，解决问题和培养干部，也便于同其他部门确定统一计划，防止多头下厂、妨害生产的现象的发生。由于劳动保护工作和工业卫生工作有着不可分割的联系，去年我们还广泛采用了同有关部门组成联合工作组的方式，共同作好工业卫生工作。例如，进行粉尘、毒物调查研究时，我们和劳动局、市工会联合会组成工作组；搞食堂卫生工作时，我们和市工会联合会组成工作组。在各区则由区卫生科、劳保科和区工会共同组成工作小组。这既便于统一思想、统一计划，也便于统一力量、统一检查。去年，市级和区级在工业卫生领导方面的分工是，市卫生局负责国营和公营工厂及工地的工业卫生工作，区卫生科负责私营工厂的卫生工作。这样分工的好处是各有重点，力量都能发挥。这已经在工作中得到证明了。
    过去一年，天津市的工业卫生工作又前进了一步。但缺点也还很多。例如，对重工业和国防工业的医疗卫生工作尚未给予足够重视；工作还很不深入，缺乏细致的调查研究，不善于也没有及时总结经验；还没有组织和发挥所有医疗力量来为生产服务。今后，我们要在党委的统一领导下，进一步依靠群众，加强政治思想领导，全面地实行工厂三级医疗预防制，并逐步推行车间医师制，更好地组织医疗力量为生产服务，大力解决粉尘、毒物问题，继续培养和提高干部的业务水平。并重点地在有条件的大厂中建立和健全卫生组织机构，逐步地开展卫生监督工作。
