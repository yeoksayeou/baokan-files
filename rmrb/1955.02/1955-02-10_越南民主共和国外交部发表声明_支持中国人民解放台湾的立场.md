Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 9th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on February 8th, protesting the aggressive actions of the US imperialists in Taiwan and other islands along the Chinese coast, and supporting the position of the Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China on liberating Taiwan. The statement is as follows:

    The serious situation in Taiwan is a matter of deep concern to the people of all countries, who are eagerly seeking a satisfactory solution.

    From a political, geographical, and historical point of view, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are important parts of Chinese territory. The Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation both recognized that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands belong to China.

    However, the US imperialists deliberately deny this extremely clear historical and legal reality. Recently, they fabricated the US-Chiang Treaty, directed the traitorous Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to harass the People's Republic of China, and assembled their naval, land, and air forces near the Chinese coast in order to occupy Taiwan and use this group of islands as a military base for attacking China and provoking a new war. The US imperialists bear full responsibility for creating the serious situation in Taiwan and the tense situation in the Far East.

    In order to cover up their conspiracy, the US imperialists have staged a farce, namely suggesting a ceasefire in the United Nations. They raised the issue of implementing a ceasefire between two Chinas, distinguishing Taiwan and the Penghu Islands from other islands near the Chinese mainland. This is merely an arrogant claim aimed at separating Taiwan and the Penghu Islands from Chinese territory.

    The US imperialists' actions deliberately disregard truth and justice, openly violate international agreements, violate the United Nations Charter, and brazenly infringe upon the sovereignty and territory of the People's Republic of China. Not only can the Chinese people not tolerate such actions, but the people of all countries and all peace-loving and just governments in the world cannot tolerate such actions.

    The only way to resolve the serious situation in Taiwan and the tense situation in the Far East should be the method stipulated in the proposal made by the Soviet Union in the United Nations Security Council. The issue to be discussed should be the US aggression against the People's Republic of China in Taiwan and other island areas of China. As for the solution, the US government should end its aggression against China, withdraw all US troops from Taiwan and other Chinese islands, and stop interfering in China's internal affairs.

    The Chinese people and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China have repeatedly declared their determination to liberate Taiwan. This is purely China's internal affair, is the legitimate right of the Chinese people, and is fully in line with the spirit of defending and consolidating peace in Asia and the world. This has won the firm support of the people of all countries.

    The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly support the position of the Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China to resolutely liberate Taiwan, and they support the rational proposal put forward by the Soviet Union in the United Nations Security Council.

    The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believe that the conspiracy to seize Taiwan and the conspiracy to establish an aggressive Southeast Asia bloc to interfere in South Vietnam and undermine the implementation of the Indochina armistice agreement are all part of the US imperialists' overall plan to create tension in Asia and undermine peace and the security of all countries.

    The Vietnamese people and the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are determined to unite closely with the Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China, with the peace-loving people and governments of all countries in Asia and the world, to oppose the conspiracies of the US imperialists in order to safeguard and consolidate peace.

    越南民主共和国外交部发表声明
    支持中国人民解放台湾的立场
    【新华社九日讯】越南通讯社河内九日讯：越南民主共和国外交部八日发表声明，抗议美帝国主义者在台湾和中国沿海其他岛屿的侵略行为并支持中国人民和中华人民共和国政府解放台湾的立场。声明如下：
    台湾的严重局势是目前世界各国人民深切关怀的一个问题，他们急切地希望寻求一种令人满意的解决办法。
    从政治、地理和历史的观点来看，台湾和澎湖是中国领土的重要部分。开罗宣言和波茨坦公告都承认台湾和澎湖是属于中国的。
    然而美帝国主义者故意否认这种极其清楚的历史的和法律的现实。最近他们制造了美蒋条约，指挥卖国贼蒋介石匪帮骚扰中华人民共和国，把他们的海陆空军集合在中国海岸附近，以占领台湾和利用这个岛群作为进攻中国和挑起新战争的军事基地。美帝国主义者应对制造台湾的严重局势和远东的紧张局势负完全的责任。
    美帝国主义者为了掩饰他们的阴谋，已经演了一出滑稽剧，即在联合国里建议停火。他们提出在两个中国之间实行停火的问题，把台湾和澎湖同中国大陆附近的其他岛屿区别开来。这只不过是一种蛮横的说法，目的在把台湾和澎湖同中国领土割离开。
    美帝国主义者进行这种活动，蓄意蔑视真理和正义，公开破坏国际协定，违反联合国宪章，无耻地侵犯中华人民共和国的主权和领土。不仅中国人民不能容忍这种行动，而且全世界各国人民和一切爱好和平和正义的政府也不能容忍这种行动。
    解决台湾的严重局势和远东的紧张局势的唯一办法应当是苏联在联合国安全理事会中提出的建议里所规定的办法。要讨论的问题应当是美国在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为。至于说到解决办法，美国政府应当结束它对中国的侵略行为，从台湾和其他中国岛屿撤退一切美国军队，并停止干涉中国的内政。
    中国人民和中华人民共和国中央人民政府一再声明他们解放台湾的决心。这纯粹是中国的内政，是中国人民的合法权利，并且完全符合于保卫和巩固亚洲和世界和平的精神。这已经获得了各国人民的坚决支持。
    越南人民和越南民主共和国政府坚决支持中国人民和中华人民共和国政府坚决要解放台湾的立场，他们拥护苏联在联合国安全理事会提出的合理建议。
    越南人民和越南民主共和国政府认为，侵占台湾的阴谋和建立侵略性的东南亚集团来干涉越南南部并破坏印度支那停战协定的履行的阴谋，都是美帝国主义者在亚洲造成紧张局势和破坏和平和各国的安全的总计划的一部分。
    越南人民和越南民主共和国政府决心同中国人民和中华人民共和国政府，同亚洲和全世界各国爱好和平的人民和政府紧密地团结在一起，反对美帝国主义者的阴谋，以维护和巩固和平。
