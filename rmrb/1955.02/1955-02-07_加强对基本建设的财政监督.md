Strengthen Financial Supervision of Capital Construction

Our country's capital construction work has made great achievements in the past few years, basically achieving the principles of "good, fast, and economical," completing considerable construction tasks, and gradually improving the quality of projects. In the future, in addition to striving to ensure the balanced completion of the capital construction progress plan and continuing to consolidate and continuously improve the quality of projects, a most important task in capital construction is to strengthen the economic viewpoint from capital construction planning and design to construction. In the past, this was generally not done enough. If it was excusable in the past due to our lack of knowledge, then in the future, we must resolutely correct it, resolutely oppose waste, reduce project costs, and rationally and economically use the state's capital construction investment. Strengthening the financial supervision of capital construction is one of the effective ways to promote the realization of this task.

In 1954, thanks to the strengthening of leadership over capital construction by party and state organs at all levels, and the continuous improvement of business management by construction units and construction enterprises, paying attention to the rational use of state funds, and strengthening financial supervision of capital construction, various regions reduced over-estimated project costs by 226.5 billion yuan, reduced the value of equipment that should not be purchased or could be postponed by 1,237.6 billion yuan, handled 2,176 billion yuan of stockpiled equipment, and eliminated extra-plan projects and falsely reported project funds of 297.1 billion yuan. This fully illustrates that the phenomena of excessively high project costs, blindly stockpiling equipment, and dispersed use of funds in capital construction are still very serious. Therefore, it is entirely necessary to further strengthen financial supervision of capital construction now.

1955 is a year of decisive significance for our country's implementation of the First Five-Year Plan. The state's investment in capital construction is more than any previous year, and the scale of capital construction will be larger and the funds required will be more. Therefore, we need to strengthen financial supervision of capital construction even more, use construction funds economically, and expand internal accumulation in capital construction. What are the main links to focus on in strengthening financial supervision of capital construction at present?

First, it is necessary to supervise construction units and construction enterprises to correctly prepare design budgets and complete the task of reducing project costs. We should first help relevant agencies formulate various quotas related to capital construction. Without realizing this premise, the review of design budgets is impossible. Taking the existing quotas as an example, the preparation of capital construction design budgets is generally inaccurate and too high. Last year, more than 10,000 design budgets were reviewed, and it was found that the average was 7.8 percent higher than the national quota. The high design budget not only increases the state's financial burden but also makes construction units and construction enterprises not pay attention to improving business management and using funds carefully. This will inevitably lead to serious waste in capital construction. Therefore, this year, we must seriously review design budgets based on national quotas, urge construction units and construction enterprises to correctly prepare plans to reduce project costs, and inspect and supervise the implementation of the plans.

Second, it is necessary to supervise the use of capital construction funds in accordance with the uses stipulated in the plan to ensure that the capital construction plan can be completed on schedule. In the past, many construction units dispersed funds on unnecessary or extra-plan projects, so that major projects could not be completed on schedule, delaying the time to put them into production. Therefore, this year, we must strengthen the supervision of the use of funds, strictly prevent the misappropriation of capital construction funds, and allocate project funds in accordance with the principle of "pay as much as the project is completed" based on the plans and budgets approved by the state, and eliminate the costs of those extra-plan projects and falsely reported project funds. At the same time, we must strengthen the supervision of expenditures such as materials, equipment, wages, and miscellaneous expenses; for projects that have been completed, we should also urge construction units and construction enterprises to promptly accept them, promptly prepare project settlements, and organize relevant units to conduct economic analysis of all projects, from which to draw lessons. Not only should we analyze whether the project meets the quota (the quota we have stipulated needs to be verified by practice) and the design budget; but also analyze whether certain quotas are too high, whether raw materials are wasted, whether there are errors in the design, and whether it meets the principles of applicability, economy, and aesthetics.

Third, it is necessary to supervise construction units and construction enterprises to fully mobilize internal resources. This is one of the main sources of capital construction fund accumulation. Our country has accumulated a large amount of materials over the years for capital construction. According to incomplete statistics, the current stockpiled materials are worth more than 3,300 billion yuan. If these funds can be fully mobilized, fiscal expenditure can be greatly reduced. But this must be guaranteed by good systems, such as the contracting system for labor and materials, and the implementation of the capital construction procedure system. Therefore, this year, we must strengthen the urging of construction units and construction enterprises to clear up creditor's rights and debts, dispose of stockpiled materials and equipment, and offset the funds recovered against fiscal appropriations. At the same time, we must strictly supervise the allocation and use of working capital, verify and allocate the working capital required to purchase materials according to the actual needs of the project, prevent the generation of new stockpiles, and accelerate the turnover of funds. For the profits, depreciation funds, and other surplus funds that should be turned over in capital construction, we must also urge them to be turned over in a timely manner to ensure fiscal revenue.

Some people say: "Financial supervision is a trouble. Although implementing financial supervision can save some funds, but the current tasks are heavy and the requirements are urgent. If strict financial supervision is implemented, it will hinder the completion of the construction plan." This view is incorrect. According to the state's construction plan, every yuan of our capital construction investment has a specific purpose. If we do not strengthen financial supervision, these funds are likely to be dispersed, so that the established tasks cannot be completed. In the past, many construction units spent a lot of money, and there were no funds available for the later projects, resulting in either an additional budget or a reduction in workload, so that the state's construction plan could not be completed on schedule. However, in places where business management has been improved and financial supervision has been strengthened, a completely different situation has emerged. For example, the capital construction project of Chongqing 101 Factory in 1953 originally required a fiscal appropriation of 50.9 billion yuan. Later, after handling the stockpiled funds over the years, not only did it not require a fiscal appropriation, but it completed a workload of 59.4 billion yuan and also turned over 19.2 billion yuan of surplus funds. It can be seen from this that strengthening financial supervision of capital construction is beneficial and entirely necessary.

Some people also say: "Capital construction is a new job, without experience. If the budget is not widened and more materials are not stockpiled, it will affect the completion of the construction plan; even if there is some backlog, it will still be used next year anyway." They hope to get more money and spend money more casually. This idea is also very harmful. The main source of construction funds in our country is relying on internal accumulation, which is not easy to come by. If we do not carefully use the state's construction funds, it will affect the speed of the country's industrialization. If every project estimates the budget higher, it will postpone many construction projects that could have been built. If every project stockpiles more materials, it will inevitably cause a large amount of stockpiles. Even if these materials can be used in the next year, they have already slept in the warehouse for a year; and our material production is limited, and the stockpiling of materials in some projects will inevitably make it difficult to prepare materials for other projects. It is very obvious that this kind of thinking is fundamentally incompatible with the socialist economic accounting point of view.

Among some cadres of the People's Construction Bank of China, there is also the idea of ​​one-sidedly emphasizing the supply of funds and not daring to carry out supervision. Some said: "Capital construction, especially the construction of key projects, is supported by the people of the whole country. The bank should also relax its standards to ensure the supply of funds." Some said: "If the money is given and there is a problem, the bank and the construction unit are jointly responsible; if the funds are not supplied in time, and the funds are delayed, the bank will be solely responsible." Therefore, they only pay attention to supplying funds, giving money when requested, and relax financial supervision. These are all very wrong. The People's Construction Bank of China is a specialized institution of the state for carrying out financial supervision of capital construction. Supervising the rational use of funds, like ensuring the timely supply of funds, is a task entrusted to it by the Party and the government, and must not be afraid of taking responsibility and shrinking back. Implementing strict financial supervision, reducing unreasonable expenditures, and opposing waste and dispersed use of funds are precisely to ensure that all reasonable expenditures receive a sufficient supply of funds, and to ensure that the construction projects approved by the state can be completed according to the plan, which is also the most effective support for capital construction. Of course, this does not mean that strict financial supervision of capital construction does not need to take care of the actual difficulties that objectively exist in some units. On the contrary, these difficulties must be taken care of, and some cumbersome procedures in economic appropriation still need to be corrected. However, taking care is not to allow some abnormal phenomena in capital construction to continue to exist and develop, but to better and faster eliminate these abnormal phenomena.

Implementing financial supervision of capital construction is a complex task involving all aspects. All construction units and construction enterprises must strive to improve the level of business management and use construction funds carefully; the People's Construction Bank of China must strengthen contacts with relevant departments, fully consult and resolve problems in the work. Party and government organizations at all levels must further strengthen their leadership over financial supervision. As long as all parties pay attention to this work, the financial supervision of capital construction can definitely be done well.

### 加强对基本建设的财政监督

    加强对基本建设的财政监督
    我国的基本建设工作，几年来有很大的成绩，基本上做到了“好、快、省”的原则，完成了相当大的建设任务，工程质量也逐步有所改进。今后，除了要努力保证均衡地完成基本建设的进度计划、继续巩固并不断提高工程质量以外，基本建设中一项最主要的工作，就是要从基本建设计划、设计到施工中加强经济观点的问题。这一点，过去一般地是做得不够的。假使说在过去由于我们知识不够，情有可原的话，那末，今后就必须坚决改正，就要坚决反对浪费，降低工程成本，合理地节约地使用国家的基本建设投资。而加强基本建设的财政监督工作就是促进这一任务实现的有效办法之一。
    一九五四年，由于各级党和国家机关加强了对基本建设的领导；由于建设单位和建筑企业不断改善经营管理，注意合理使用国家资金，加强了对基本建设的财政监督，各地核减了高估的工程造价二千二百六十五亿元，核减了不应当购买和可以延期购买的器材价值一万二千三百七十六亿元，处理了积压器材二万一千七百六十亿元，剔除了计划外工程和虚报的工程价款二千九百七十一亿元。这就充分说明了基本建设中工程造价偏高、盲目储备器材和分散使用资金的现象还是十分严重的。因此，现在进一步加强基本建设的财政监督是完全必要的。
    一九五五年是我国执行第一个五年计划具有决定意义的一年。国家对基本建设的投资比过去任何一年为多，而且越是往后，基本建设的规模越大，需要的资金也越多。因此，我们更需要加强对基本建设的财政监督，节约地使用建设资金，扩大基本建设方面的内部积累。当前加强基本建设的财政监督，要抓紧那几个主要环节呢？
    第一，要监督建设单位和建筑企业正确地编制设计预算，完成降低工程成本的任务。应该首先帮助有关机关制定基本建设有关的各项定额。如果不实现这个前提，设计预算的审查就是不可能的。以现有的定额来说，目前基本建设设计预算的编制，一般都是不精确的、偏高的。去年审查了一万多件设计预算，就发现平均比国家规定的定额高出百分之七点八。设计预算的偏高，既加重了国家的财政负担，也使建设单位和建筑企业不注意去改善经营管理和精打细算地使用资金。这就必然造成基本建设中的严重浪费。因此，今年必须根据国家规定的定额，认真审查设计预算，督促建设单位和建筑企业，正确地编制降低工程成本的计划，并对计划的执行情况，进行检查监督。
    第二，要监督基本建设资金按照计划规定的用途使用，保证基本建设计划能够按期完成。过去有不少建设单位把资金分散使用在不必要的或计划以外的工程项目上，以致主要的工程项目不能按期完成，推迟了投入生产的时间。因此，今年必须加强对资金使用的监督，严格防止挪用基本建设资金，并根据国家批准的计划和预算，按照“完成多少工程给多少钱”的原则，拨付工程价款，剔除那些计划外工程的费用和虚报的工程价款。同时要加强对材料、设备、工资和杂费等费用支出的监督；对于已经竣工的工程，还应该督促建设单位和建筑企业及时验收，及时作好工程结算，并组织有关单位进行全部工程的经济分析，从其中得出经验教训。不仅要分析工程是否合乎定额（我们所规定的定额有待于实践的证验），合乎设计预算；而且要分析某些定额是否高了、原材料是否浪费了、设计是否有错误、是否合乎适用、经济以及美观的原则。
    第三，要监督建设单位和建筑企业充分动员内部资源。这是基本建设资金积累的主要来源之一。我国的基本建设历年积存的物资是很大的。据不完全的统计，目前积压的器材约值三万三千余亿元。如果能把这些资金充分动员出来，就可以大大减少财政支出。但这必须有好的制度，如包工包料制度以及执行基本建设程序的制度等来保证。因此，今年必须加强督促建设单位和建筑企业清理债权债务，处理积压的材料和设备，并将收回的资金抵充财政拨款。同时要严格监督流动资金的拨付和使用，根据工程的实际需要，核实拨付购买材料所需的周转资金，防止产生新的积压，加速资金的周转速度。对于基本建设中应该上缴的利润、折旧资金和其他多余资金，也必须督促及时上缴，以保证财政收入。
    有人说：“财政监督是一种麻烦。实行财政监督固然可以节约一些资金，但目前任务重，要求急，如果实行严格的财政监督，就会妨碍建设计划的完成。”这种看法是不对的。根据国家的建设计划，我们每一元的基本建设投资都有一定的用途，如果不加强财政监督，这些资金就很有可能被分散使用，以致完不成既定的任务。过去就有不少建设单位花了很多钱，后期工程无款可用，结果不是追加预算，就是削减工作量，使国家的建设计划不能按期完成。但在改善了经营管理，加强了财政监督的地方，就出现了完全不同的情况。例如重庆一零一厂一九五三年的基本建设工程，原计划需要财政拨款五百零九亿元，后来处理了历年积压的资金，不仅不需要财政拨款，就完成了五百九十四亿元的工作量，而且还上缴了一百九十二亿元的多余资金。由此可见，加强基本建设的财政监督是有好处的，也是完全必要的。
    还有人说：“基本建设是一件新的工作，没有经验，不把预算打宽些，不多储备些材料，就要影响建设计划的完成；即使有些积压，反正今年不用明年还是要用的。”他们希望钱拿得多些，花钱可以随便些。这种想法也是十分有害的。我国建设资金的主要来源是依靠内部积累，得来是很不容易的。如果我们不精打细算地使用国家的建设资金，就会影响国家工业化的速度。如果每一项工程都把预算估高一些，就会把许多本来可以修建的建设项目推迟下去。如果每一项工程都把材料储备得多一些，就必然造成大量的积压，即使这些材料在下一个年度还可以利用，但已经在仓库里睡了一年觉；而我们的材料生产是有限的，一部分工程积压了材料，就必然会使另一部分工程的备料发生困难。十分明显，这种思想是和社会主义的经济核算观点根本不相容的。
    在中国人民建设银行的某些干部中，也存在着片面强调供应资金，而不敢进行监督的思想。有的说：“基本建设，特别是重点工程的建设，全国人民都在支援。银行也应该放宽尺度，保证资金供应。”有的说：“给了钱，出了问题，银行和建设单位共同负责；资金供应不及时，万一耽误用款，银行要单独负责。”因而他们就只注意供应资金，要钱就给，而放松了财政监督。这些，都是十分错误的。中国人民建设银行是国家对基本建设实行财政监督的专责机构。监督资金的合理使用，和保证资金的及时供应一样，是党和政府交付给它的任务，决不能怕负责任而畏缩不前。实行严格的财政监督，核减不合理的开支，反对浪费和分散使用资金的现象，正是为了保证各项合理的支出得到充分的资金供应，保证国家批准的建设项目能够按照计划完成，也就是最有效地支援了基本建设。当然，这并不是说对基本建设实行严格的财政监督，就不要照顾某些单位客观存在的实际困难了。恰恰相反，这些困难必须加以照顾，而经济拨款中某些繁琐手续也还有待改正。但照顾不是听任某些基本建设中的不正常现象继续存在和发展下去，而是为了更好地、更快地消灭这些不正常的现象。
    对基本建设实行财政监督，是关系到各个方面的一项复杂的工作。各个建设单位和建筑企业必须努力提高经营管理水平，精打细算地使用建设资金；中国人民建设银行必须加强与有关部门的联系，充分协商，解决工作中的问题。各级党和政府的组织必须进一步加强对财政监督工作的领导。只要各方面都注意这项工作，基本建设的财政监督工作是一定可以做好的。
