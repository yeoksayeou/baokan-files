Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 15th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, Kaesong: US military aircraft once again intruded into the rear area of the DPRK/Chinese side on the 11th. The Secretary-General of the DPRK/Chinese side of the Military Armistice Commission lodged a strong protest with the US side on the 14th regarding this incident.

At approximately 10:43 AM on February 11th, a formation of US military aircraft, consisting of four jet fighters and one large military propeller-driven aircraft, flew from the southern sea over the DPRK/Chinese side’s area, intruded into the airspace near the DPRK/Chinese side’s Sin-do (island), flew along the DPRK/Chinese side’s coastline, and then flew south, passing over the DPRK/Chinese side’s coastal areas of Cho-do (island) and Changsan-ri, as well as other areas.

The Secretary-General of the DPRK/Chinese side lodged the following strong protest with the US side at a meeting held between the secretaries of both sides of the Military Armistice Commission: Recently, US military aircraft formations have continuously intruded into our rear area and carried out hostile actions. Regarding these incidents, our side lodged a strong protest with the US side at the Military Armistice Commission meeting on February 9th and resolutely demanded that the US side immediately take practical measures to prevent the recurrence of similar provocative incidents.

However, the US side has not only failed to cease these hostile actions but has instead once again dispatched its military aircraft formations to intrude into our rear area. I am instructed to lodge a strong protest against this.

Finally, the Secretary-General of the DPRK/Chinese side once again resolutely demanded that the US side immediately cease these provocative hostile actions, punish all US personnel involved in the aforementioned incidents in accordance with the Armistice Agreement, and take practical measures to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents.

As of the 15th, the investigation is proceeding smoothly.
