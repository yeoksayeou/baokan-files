Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 10th: According to the Korean Central News Agency in Kaesong on the 9th, at the Korean Military Armistice Commission meeting on February 9th, the chief delegate of the Korean-Chinese side, Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho, lodged a strong protest regarding the hostile actions of US military aircraft on February 5th in violation of the Armistice Agreement and illegal intrusion into the Korean-Chinese side's area.

    Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho pointed out conclusive material evidence sufficient to prove this violation of the Armistice Agreement. He also pointed out that the US side is using despicable and insidious means, starting their propaganda machine to cover up the facts.

    Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho stated, "Our side believes that this hostile action is a premeditated provocative action by the US side, the purpose of which is obviously to further intensify the tense situation in the Far East caused by the US government's blatant interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China."

    Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho demanded that the principal offenders and accomplices in this incident be punished in accordance with the Armistice Agreement.

    Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho finally warned: If US military aircraft intrude into our area again to carry out hostile actions, our side will take necessary measures, and the US side must bear full responsibility for the consequences arising therefrom.

    At the Military Armistice Commission meeting, the US chief delegate, Major General Carter, not only attempted to completely deny the aforementioned incident but also tried in vain to shift the responsibility to the Korean-Chinese side. Carter distorted the facts, as if this were a so-called "defensive action" in the "high seas."

    After refuting the US side's unfounded claims, Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho suggested jointly requesting the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to dispatch a mobile Neutral Nations Inspection Team to the scene for investigation, because the US side denied the ironclad facts with unreasonable excuses.

    On February 9th, Lieutenant General Li Sang-cho sent a letter to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission, presenting the conclusive facts of the US military aircraft's illegal intrusion into the Korean-Chinese side's military control zone and provocative actions, requesting the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to conduct a strict investigation of this incident in accordance with Article 28 of the Armistice Agreement. The letter stated that on February 5, 1955, a formation composed of an RB-45 military reconnaissance aircraft and eight military jet aircraft belonging to the United Nations Command side intruded from the southern sea. After flying over the vicinity of Changshan Point, the vicinity of Shinmi Island, Hanchuan, and other places under the military control of the Korean-Chinese side, these aircraft penetrated deep into the rear of the Korean-Chinese side, carrying out serious hostile actions and illegally attacking the Korean-Chinese side's military aircraft that were on patrol missions.

    The Korean-Chinese side's military aircraft on patrol missions were forced to counterattack the United Nations Command side's military aircraft. The United Nations Command side's military aircraft that intruded into the Korean-Chinese side's airspace to carry out hostile actions fled southward, passing through the territory under the military control of the Korean-Chinese side near Hamjong-ri, Onjeong-ri, Gwangryang Bay, Cho Island, and Changshan Point. During the aircraft's intrusion into the Korean-Chinese side's airspace, the United Nations Command side's military aircraft dropped some gasoline drums on the Korean-Chinese side's territory, and people in the area saw these gasoline drums.

    The letter stated that, given that the United Nations Command side's dispatch of military aircraft to carry out hostile actions is a violation of the Armistice Agreement, and that investigating violations of the Armistice Agreement outside the Demilitarized Zone is within the authority of the mobile Neutral Nations Inspection Team, I request the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission to dispatch a mobile Neutral Nations Inspection Team to Onjeong-ri in the Korean-Chinese side's military control area to investigate the aforementioned incident of the United Nations Command side's violation of the Armistice Agreement on February 5, 1955.

    就美机违反停战协定非法侵入朝中地区进行敌对行动事
    李相朝中将向美方提出强硬抗议
    【新华社平壤十日电】据朝鲜中央通讯社开城九日讯：在二月九日的朝鲜军事停战委员会会议上，朝中方面首席委员李相朝中将就美方军用飞机在二月五日违反停战协定非法侵入朝中方面地区进行敌对行动一事，提出了强硬的抗议。
    李相朝中将指出了足以证明这次违反停战协定事件的肯定物证。他还指出，美方正在使用卑鄙的阴险手段，开动他们的宣传机器来掩盖事实。
    李相朝中将声称，我方认为这种敌对行动是美方处心积虑的挑衅行动，其目的显然是进一步加剧由于美国政府对中华人民共和国内政进行露骨的干涉而造成的远东紧张局势。
    李相朝中将要求根据停战协定惩罚这次事件的主犯和从犯。
    李相朝中将最后警告：如果美方军用飞机再度侵入我方地区进行敌对行动，我方就采取必要的措施，而且由此所产生的后果，必须由美方担负全部责任。
    在军事停战委员会会议上，美方首席委员卡特尔少将不仅试图完全否认上述事件，而且还徒然地想要把责任推到朝中方面，卡特尔歪曲事实，好像这是在“公海上”的一个所谓“防御行动”。
    李相朝中将在驳斥了美方的毫无根据的说法以后，建议联合要求中立国监察委员会派遣一个机动的中立国视察小组到现场进行调查，因为美方以无理的借口否认铁的事实。
    李相朝中将在二月九日致函中立国监察委员会，提出了美方军用飞机非法侵入朝中方面军事控制区并进行挑衅的确凿事实，要求中立国监察委员会依照停战协定第二十八条对这次事件进行严格的调查。信中说，一九五五年二月五日，联合国军司令部方面所属的由一架RB四十五型军事侦察机和八架军用喷气飞机组成的一个编队从南方海面侵入，在飞过长山串附近、身弥岛附近、汉川以及在朝中方面军事控制下的其他地方以后，这些飞机深入朝中方面的后方，进行严重的敌对行动，并且非法袭击当时在执行巡逻任务的朝中方面的军用飞机。
    朝中方面在执行巡逻任务的军用飞机被迫对联合国军司令部方面的军用飞机进行反击，侵入朝中方面领空进行敌对行动的这架联合国军司令部方面的军用飞机就向南逃去，经过在朝中方面军事控制下的领土咸从里、温井里、广梁湾、椒岛附近，长山串附近。在这架飞机侵入朝中方面领空的过程中，联合国军司令部方面的军用飞机在朝中方面的领土上投下了一些汽油桶，这个地区的人看到了这些汽油桶。
    信中说，鉴于联合国军司令部方面派遣军用飞机进行敌对行动是违反停战协定以及在非军事地区以外调查违反停战协定的行为是在机动的中立国视察小组权限以内，我要求中立国监察委员会派遣一个机动的中立国视察小组到朝中方面军事管制地区的温井里对上述的联合国军司令部方面在一九五五年二月五日违反停战协定进行敌对行动的事件进行调查。
