Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 1st (TASS dispatch)

The American imperialists are making every effort to sharpen and complicate the international situation in the Far East. The concentration of the American Navy and Air Force in the Taiwan area proves this. The recent passage by the United States Congress of a proposal authorizing the President to take armed action, according to his own considerations, to defend Taiwan and other coastal islands of the People's Republic of China is a crude and deliberate provocation.

The provocative actions taken by the United States in the Taiwan area are a new manifestation of the American policy of aggression against the People's Republic of China. The United States intends to permanently occupy Taiwan and use it as a base for preparing and launching aggressive wars in the Far East.

The United States is grossly interfering in China's internal affairs and blatantly violating the basic norms of international law and the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter. The American ruling clique deceptively claims that they are doing this to "defend" territory that has never belonged to the United States. However, this argument can only expose the imperialist forces' true plot against Taiwan and other Chinese islands.

Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory, and the island has been incorporated into the Chinese map since ancient times. China's jurisdiction over this island was reaffirmed by the most important international agreements such as the Cairo Declaration, the Potsdam Proclamation, and the agreement on Japan's surrender. According to all these international documents that the United States and the United Kingdom once signed, Taiwan should be returned to China. In this regard, it is also impossible not to mention the following fact: In October 1945, with the consent of all the anti-Hitler allies, China accepted the surrender of the local Japanese army in Taiwan. This once again powerfully illustrates that China has an inalienable right to Taiwan. Taiwan belongs to China historically, politically, and legally.

The American occupation of Taiwan is an extremely crude violation of international agreements and a shameless act of barbarism. Japan originally occupied the island, and now the United States occupies the island.

No force can prevent the People's Republic of China from returning Taiwan and other coastal islands to the embrace of the motherland and unifying all its territories into a unified country. Severing this part or that part of China's territory grossly offends the national sentiment of the Chinese people and arouses their unparalleled resolute protest and anger.

At the instigation of the American diplomatic authorities, New Zealand put forward a proposal to discuss the "situation in the Taiwan Strait" by the Security Council. The intention of this proposal is to use the United Nations to interfere in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China and use the flag of the United Nations to cover up American aggression against China.

However, the United Nations Security Council, as an international body for maintaining world peace, has the right and should not discuss the "situation in the Taiwan Strait," but rather discuss the acts of aggression by the United States of America against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan region.

As for the Soviet government, as pointed out in the statement of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 31, it is concerned about the serious situation developing in Taiwan and other Chinese coastal islands. This existing situation is endangering the maintenance of peace and deepening the danger of a new war. The reason for this situation is that the United States, with the help of Chiang Kai-shek, has occupied the Chinese island of Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and some other Chinese islands several years ago. Recently, the United States has taken new aggressive actions in that region, which has further intensified the tension.

The Soviet government believes that this issue needs to be fully discussed in the United Nations Security Council. The Soviet government believes that the discussion of this issue cannot be without the participation of the delegation of the People's Republic of China, because the participation of the delegation of the People's Republic of China is particularly necessary, as this is a matter of aggression by the United States of America against China and interference in China's internal affairs. For this reason, the Soviet representative to the Security Council proposed at the Security Council meeting on January 31 to invite representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of the issue of American aggression against the People's Republic of China in Taiwan and other Chinese island areas.

In suggesting that the Security Council consider this issue, the Soviet Union put forward its own draft resolution. The draft resolution proposes that the Security Council condemn the aggressive acts of the United States of America against the People's Republic of China; proposes that the United States government take immediate steps to end the above-mentioned aggressive acts and its interference in China's internal affairs; proposes that the government of the United States of America immediately withdraw all its air, sea, and land forces from Taiwan Island and all other territories belonging to China; and calls on any party to prevent military action in the Taiwan area in order to facilitate the withdrawal of all armed forces that do not belong to the People's Republic of China from the islands in that area.

These important proposals put forward by the Soviet Union, aimed at eliminating the tension in the Taiwan area and the Far East, are in line with the wishes of all peace-loving people who are concerned about the current situation in the Taiwan area and believe that this situation is a threat to the maintenance of world peace.

China has issued a firm protest against the new acts of aggression by the United States in these days. History proves that the American attempt to intimidate the 600 million Chinese people is bound to go bankrupt. The "People's Daily" wrote:
	“Taiwan, Penghu, and the islands of Dachen, Kinmen, and Matsu, etc., occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique… are all inalienable parts of Chinese territory. This fact cannot be denied by anyone… Therefore, the war actions of the Chinese people to liberate the coastal islands, including Taiwan and Penghu, completely belong to China's internal affairs… The Chinese people will never allow anyone to interfere in order to exercise their sovereignty, liberate all of China, including the liberation of Taiwan.”

Broad public opinion in various countries of the world unanimously supports the just demands of the Chinese people that American imperialism not interfere in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China. These days, millions upon millions of people around the world are supporting the great Chinese people and denouncing the evil aggressive policies adopted by the United States against the People's Republic of China in order to intensify international tensions in the Far East and the world.

The United States must stop its acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China - this is the unanimous demand of peace-loving people.

### 美国必须停止对中国的侵略行为——苏联“真理报”二月一日社论

    美国必须停止对中国的侵略行为
    ——苏联“真理报”二月一日社论
    美帝国主义者正在竭力企图使远东的国际局势尖锐化和复杂化。美国的海军和空军在台湾岛地区集结，就证明了这一点。最近美国国会通过了一个提案，准许总统根据自己的考虑对捍卫台湾和其他沿海岛屿的主权的中华人民共和国采取武装行动，这个提案是粗暴的和蓄意的挑衅。
    美国在台湾地区采取的挑衅行动是美国对中华人民共和国实行的侵略方针的新的表现。美国打算永久地侵占台湾，并且打算利用台湾作为它在远东准备和发动侵略战争的基地。
    美国粗暴地干涉中国内政，悍然破坏了国际法的起码准则和联合国宪章的基本原则。美国统治集团骗人地说他们这样做是为了“保卫”从来不属于美国的领土，然而这种论调却只能暴露出帝国主义势力对台湾和中国其他岛屿的真正图谋。
    台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分，这个岛屿从很久远的年代起就归入中国的版图之内。中国对这个岛屿的管辖权曾经为开罗宣言、波茨坦公告、关于日本投降的协定等最重要的国际协定所重新肯定。根据所有这些美国和英国曾经在上面签字的国际文件，台湾应当归还中国。在这方面，还不能不提到下面这一个事实：一九四五年十月，中国在所有反希特勒同盟国的同意下，在台湾接受了当地日本军队的投降。这再一次有力地说明中国对台湾有着不可剥夺的权利，台湾无论从历史上、政治上和法律上来说，都是属于中国的。
    美国侵占台湾是极其粗暴地违反国际协定的行为，这是一种无耻的横蛮的行为。原先是日本侵占了这个岛屿，而现在是美国侵占了这个岛屿。
    没有任何力量能够阻止中华人民共和国使台湾和其他沿海岛屿重新回到祖国的怀抱，使自己的一切领土统一在一个统一的国家内。割裂中国这一部分或者那一部分的领土就粗暴地触犯了中国人民的民族感，激起了他们的无比坚决的抗议和愤怒。
    在美国外交当局的授意下，新西兰提出了关于由安全理事会讨论“关于台湾海峡的局势”的问题的建议，这个建议的用意是要利用联合国来干涉中华人民共和国的内政，利用联合国的旗帜来掩盖美国对中国的侵略行为。
    然而，联合国安全理事会，作为一个维护世界和平的国际机构，却有权而且应该不去讨论“关于台湾海峡的局势”的问题，而来讨论关于美利坚合众国在台湾地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为的问题。
    至于苏联政府，正如苏联外交部一月三十一日的声明所指出的，它对于在台湾以及其他中国沿海岛屿地区发展的严重局势感到不安。这种现存的局势正在危及和平的维持，加深新战争的危险。造成在那里发生的这种局势的原因是美国在蒋介石的帮助下，几年前就霸占了属于中国的台湾岛、澎湖列岛和中国其他一些岛屿。最近美国又在那个地区采取了新的侵略行动，这就更加加剧了紧张局势。
    苏联政府认为，需要把这个问题通盘地在联合国安全理事会加以讨论。苏联政府认为，在讨论这一个问题时不能没有中华人民共和国代表团参加，因为，由于这是一个美利坚合众国对中国的侵略行为和干涉中国内政的问题，中华人民共和国代表团的参加是尤其必要的。正因为这样，苏联驻安全理事会代表一月三十一日在安全理事会会议上提出了邀请中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表参加关于美国在台湾和其他中国岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为这个问题的讨论的建议。
    苏联在建议安全理事会考虑这一个问题时，提出了自己的决议草案。决议草案中建议安全理事会谴责美利坚合众国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为；建议美国政府立即采取步骤，以终止上述侵略行为和它对中国内政的干涉；建议美利坚合众国政府立即从台湾岛和属于中国的其他一切领土撤退它的一切空、海、陆军部队；吁请任何一方防止在台湾地区的军事行动以便于不属于中华人民共和国的一切武装部队从那个地区的岛屿撤退。
    苏联所提出的、目的在于消除台湾地区和远东的紧张局势的这些重要建议，是符合一切爱好和平的人民的愿望的，他们对台湾地区目前的局势感到不安，并且认为这种局势是对维护世界和平的威胁。
    中国这几天发出了坚决抗议美国新侵略行为的响亮的声音。历史证明，美国想要恫吓六亿中国人民的企图是必然要破产的。“人民日报”写道：
  “蒋介石卖国集团盘踞着的台湾、澎湖以及大陈、金门、马祖等岛屿……都是中国领土不可分割的一部分。这个事实是任何人都不能否认的……因此，中国人民解放包括台湾、澎湖在内的沿海岛屿的战争行动，完全属于中国的内政……中国人民为了行使自己的主权，解放全中国，包括解放台湾在内，决不容许任何人来干涉。”
    世界各国广泛舆论一致支持中国人民关于不让美帝国主义干涉中华人民共和国内政的正义要求。这些天来，世界各地千千万万的人都在声援伟大的中国人民，痛斥美国为了加剧远东和世界的国际紧张局势而对中华人民共和国采取的罪恶的侵略政策。
    美国必须停止对中华人民共和国的侵略行动——这是爱好和平的人民的一致要求。
