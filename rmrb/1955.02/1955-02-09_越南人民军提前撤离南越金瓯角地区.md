Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 8th: The Vietnamese People's Army troops stationed temporarily in the Ca Mau Cape area of South Vietnam have completely withdrawn from Ca Mau Cape on February 7th, one day ahead of the time stipulated in the armistice agreement.

    Before withdrawing, the Vietnamese People's Army properly and completely handed over the administrative power and public property in various parts of Ca Mau Cape to the French Union forces from February 3rd to 5th.

    During the assembly period, the Vietnamese People's Army repaired the power plant in Ca Mau city, which had been dismantled by the French side, tidied up the city's appearance, helped the people restore the schools destroyed by the French side, and encouraged the people to increase production and study culture. The people lived and worked in peace and contentment, and commerce prospered. When the Vietnamese People's Army withdrew from the Ca Mau area, the people were reluctant to leave and gave them a warm send-off.

    According to the provisions of the Vietnam Armistice Agreement, the Vietnamese People's Army in South Vietnam was to assemble in three areas after the ceasefire: Ham Tan, Xuyen Moc, Dong Thap Muoi, and Ca Mau Cape. The Vietnamese People's Army in the Ham Tan and Xuyen Moc areas and the Dong Thap Muoi area had withdrawn successively in October 1954. The troops withdrawn from the Ca Mau Cape area this time are the last batch of Vietnamese People's Army troops in South Vietnam.

    At present, a batch of Vietnamese People's Army troops remain in the central region of Vietnam, south of the 17th parallel temporary military demarcation line. This batch of troops will be transferred to North Vietnam in mid-May this year, at the same time as the French Union forces withdraw from the Haiphong area of North Vietnam.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 8th: The Vietnamese People's Army delegation to the Joint Armistice Commission in South Vietnam returned to Hanoi by plane on the afternoon of the 7th after successfully completing its mission.

    The chief representative of the delegation, Pham Hung, told the welcoming crowd that the work of transferring personnel from South Vietnam to North Vietnam had been carried out in an orderly manner in accordance with the Geneva Armistice Agreement, and the transfer work was completed ahead of schedule. Pham Hung said that after leaving South Vietnam, they will continue to struggle to consolidate peace and achieve the reunification of the motherland.

    They were warmly welcomed at the airport by representatives of the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front, the General Command of the Vietnamese People's Army, and various Vietnamese people's organizations.
