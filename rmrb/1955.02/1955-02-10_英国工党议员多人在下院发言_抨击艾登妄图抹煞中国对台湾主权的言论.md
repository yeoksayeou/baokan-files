Xinhua News Agency, February 9th, London: The British House of Commons once again held a heated debate on the situation in the Taiwan Strait on the 7th. Labour Party members of Parliament questioned Foreign Secretary Eden one after another. Eden, in his evasive answers, demonstrated that his attitude of attempting to erase China's sovereignty over Taiwan and following the US's aggressive policy was putting him in an increasingly embarrassing position.

Labour MP Benn questioned Eden: Does the British government believe that it is no longer bound by the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation regarding the future of Taiwan? The wartime Cairo Declaration stated that Taiwan should be returned to China. The Potsdam Proclamation stipulated that Japan should fulfill the terms of the Cairo Declaration. Eden did not dare to answer this question directly. Benn pointed out that the US-Chiang treaty implied recognition of Taiwan as an integral part of Chinese territory and questioned Eden: "Is the Foreign Secretary now telling us that this treaty signed by the United States is invalid?" Eden hurriedly denied it, but then went on to say that the decision on the future of Taiwan should be "considered later with reference to the overall situation in the Far East."

Another Labour MP, Thomas Driberg, then questioned Eden, saying that since Eden said on the 4th that the status of Taiwan was undetermined, while the terms of the US-Chiang treaty "implicitly refer to Taiwan as an integral part of China," there was a serious difference of opinion between Washington and London. Eden hurriedly denied it again.

Labour MP and former Defense Secretary Shinwell argued in his questioning that the British Foreign Secretary should issue a firm statement saying that Taiwan is an integral part of China and therefore under the control of the People's Republic of China. Labour MP Paget also pointed out that the Cairo Declaration was in fact implemented in 1945, and therefore Taiwan has been Chinese territory since then. Eden had to perfunctorily say that no one had said that Taiwan should never be given to China, but he also said that there had been no transfer of sovereignty, attempting to deny the fact that the then Chinese government had taken over Taiwan in October 1945.

During the questioning, many Labour MPs were extremely indignant that Eden did not dare to say anything about the coastal islands belonging to China. When Eden refused to express his opinion, Labour MPs loudly questioned, "Why not express an opinion?" Eden stated that he was concerned that "the United States government takes a different view."

Eden also cited what British Prime Minister Churchill said on July 12, 1954, regarding China's representation in the United Nations: "Although Her Majesty's Government believes that the Central People's Government should represent China in the United Nations, in view of this government's consistent behavior that does not conform to the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter, Her Majesty's Government feels that this issue should not be considered for the time being." Eden's slanderous remarks against China's legitimate seat in the United Nations, like his remarks erasing China's sovereignty over Taiwan, were clearly aimed at supporting the US's aggressive actions against China.

Eden also stated that Britain supports the US's military provocation of providing armed cover for the Chiang bandit troops to evacuate from Dachen Island. Labour MP Thomas Driberg asked the government to guarantee that Hong Kong would not provide repair and refueling facilities to "any warships fighting against the territory and army controlled by the Central People's Government of China." Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Dodds-Parker refused to make such a guarantee. Labour MP Bevan immediately jumped up and said, "Isn't this an extremely dangerous and provocative action?"

### 英国工党议员多人在下院发言  抨击艾登妄图抹煞中国对台湾主权的言论

    英国工党议员多人在下院发言
    抨击艾登妄图抹煞中国对台湾主权的言论
    【新华社九日讯】伦敦消息：英国下院七日再次就台湾海峡的局势展开剧烈的辩论。工党议员纷纷质问外交大臣艾登。艾登在答辩时闪烁其词，说明他所采取的企图抹煞中国对台湾的主权和追随美国侵略政策的态度，正在使他自己愈来愈陷于尴尬的境地。
    工党议员宾恩质问艾登：英国政府是否认为它已不再受关于台湾前途的开罗宣言和波茨坦公告的约束。战时的开罗宣言说，台湾应该归还中国。波茨坦公告规定，日本应该履行开罗宣言的条款。艾登不敢正面回答这个问题。宾恩指出，美蒋条约意味着承认台湾是中国领土的一个构成部分后质问艾登：“难道现在外交大臣在告诉我们，美国所签订的这个条约是无效的么？”艾登连忙否认，但他又竟说，台湾前途的决定应“以后参照远东全盘形势予以考虑”。
    另一位工党议员托马斯·德里柏接着又质问艾登说，由于艾登在四日说台湾的地位尚未确定，而美蒋条约的条款却“隐含地把台湾说成是中国的一个构成部分”，可见华盛顿和伦敦之间存在着严重的意见分歧。艾登又赶忙否认。
    工党议员、前国防大臣辛威尔在质询中主张，英国外交大臣应发表一项坚决的声明，说台湾是中国的一个构成部分，因而归中华人民共和国控制。工党议员佩吉特并且指出，事实上开罗宣言是一九四五年实行的，因此从那时起台湾就一直是中国的领土。艾登只好搪塞说：谁也没有说过台湾决不应该让给中国，但他又说并没有过主权的移交，企图抵赖一九四五年十月当时的中国政府已接收了台湾这一事实。
    在质询中许多工党议员对艾登连宣布沿海岛屿属于中国也不敢说一点，异常愤慨。当艾登拒绝表示意见时，工党议员们大声质问：“为什么不发表意见？”艾登表示他顾虑的是“美国政府采取不同的看法”。
    艾登还根据英国首相邱吉尔在一九五四年七月十二日关于中国在联合国的代表权所说的话说：“虽然女王政府认为中央人民政府应当在联合国中代表中国，但是，鉴于这个政府的一贯的不符合联合国宪章的宗旨和原则的行为，女王政府觉得，应该暂不考虑这个问题。”艾登这种反对中国在联合国的合法地位的诬蔑性论调，和他的抹煞中国对台湾的主权的论调一样，显然都是为了支持美国对中国的侵略行动。
    艾登还表示，英国支持美国武装掩护大陈岛蒋贼军撤逃的军事挑衅。工党议员托马斯·德里柏要求政府保证香港不向“对中国中央人民政府控制的领土和军队作战的任何军舰”提供修理和加燃料的便利。英国外交部驻议会次官脱顿竟拒绝作这种保证。工党议员比万马上跳起来说：“这难道不是一种极端危险的和挑衅的行动吗？”
