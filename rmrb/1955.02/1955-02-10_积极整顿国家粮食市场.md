Actively Rectify the National Grain Market

    After finishing the unified purchase of grain in various parts of Sichuan Province, they actively rectified and restored the national grain market. As of January 15th, the province had restored 2,629 national grain markets, accounting for 75.78 percent of the total number of markets built last year.
    The national grain markets that have been restored in various places have played a significant role in assisting farmers to exchange goods and adjust grain varieties. After the restoration of 182 national grain markets in the Leshan Special District, more than 1.91 million jin of grain have been put on the market by the end of last year, most of which were used to meet the needs of farmers to adjust varieties. As of January 5th, the Wenjiang Special District had restored and established 168 national grain markets, with a total of more than 1.16 million jin of grain put on the market. Farmers in the hilly areas producing corn and sweet potatoes exchanged for rice in the market, and farmers in the plain areas producing rice also exchanged for corn and sweet potatoes as feed.

    积极整顿国家粮食市场
    四州省各地结束粮食统购工作以后，积极整顿和恢复了国家粮食市场。到一月十五日止，全省已经恢复国家粮食市场二千六百二十九个，占去年已建市场总数的百分之七十五点七八。
    各地恢复起来的国家粮食市场，对协助农民互通有无、调剂粮食品种起了很大作用。乐山专区的一百八十二个国家粮食市场恢复以后，到去年年底已经上市一百九十一万多斤粮食，大部分都用来满足了农民之间调剂品种的需要。温江专区到一月五日，已经恢复和建立一百六十八个国家粮食市场，上市粮食共达一百一十六万多斤，产玉米、红苕的丘陵地区的农民在市场上换到了大米，产稻谷的平坝区农民也换到玉米、红苕作饲料。
