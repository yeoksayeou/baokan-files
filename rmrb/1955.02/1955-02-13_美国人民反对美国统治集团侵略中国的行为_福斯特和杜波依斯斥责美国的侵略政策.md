Xinhua News Agency, February 12th, New York Dispatch: The aggressive actions taken by the US ruling clique against the People's Republic of China are continuously being opposed domestically.

    The "Worker's Daily" correspondent in Philadelphia reported that the National Committee of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom recently passed a resolution opposing the dispatch of US Army, Navy, and Air Force to the Taiwan Strait. While condemning the Congressional regulations interfering in China's internal affairs, the League urged the US government to participate in an international conference of relevant countries to formulate a final and satisfactory solution to the Taiwan issue.

    The "Worker's Daily" wrote: The Progressive Party organization in New Jersey believes that the broad powers granted to Eisenhower by the Congressional resolution are "the greatest obstacle to a peaceful resolution of this problem."

    The "San Francisco Chronicle" published several letters from people who criticized US actions. For example, I. Friedman of San Francisco wrote that the argument that US armed forces occupy Taiwan for security considerations is "contrary to more correct logic."

    Similar letters are being sent to US Congressmen. An article published in "Newsweek" acknowledged that the American people are expressing concern about the US government's current policy in the Far East and oppose the occupation of Taiwan and Penghu by US armed forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 12th Dispatch: New York dispatch: William Foster, Chairman of the Communist Party of the United States, published an article in the New York "Worker's Daily" on February 7th, stating that the "ceasefire" proposal put forward by the United States on the Taiwan issue has been fiercely opposed by the People's China, which is justified. A ceasefire can only be reached on the basis of free negotiation, not on the basis of meekly accepting American orders. The United States must withdraw its troops from China's territory of Taiwan; the United Nations must also drive the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang out of this organization; at the same time, it must enable the People's China to obtain its due position in the Security Council. This is the answer suitable for the people of a free and sovereign country.

    Foster pointed out that in the face of the Chinese people's courageous attitude, the reckless militarists of the United States are trying to make it appear that the United States has been greatly insulted by the People's China. But this is absurd. Even a slight consideration of the reality of the Chinese situation can undoubtedly show that the US government has carried out a series of blatant acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China.

    The same day's "Worker's Daily" reported that the famous American black historian and peace fighter Du Bois wrote to newspaper editors across the United States, saying that the US position on the Taiwan issue is untenable and is an open act of aggression.

    He asked editors across the country: "According to what far-fetched logic can Taiwan, on the opposite side of the earth from the United States, be considered necessary to protect our western border?" He suggested that the editors put themselves in his place and think about what we would do if there was an island the size of the Netherlands off the coast of the United States, "owned by an enemy who is determined to use it to attack us," and some smaller coastal islands that were also fortified by the same enemy and repeatedly used to launch attacks. He said, "This would be dangerous."

    He pointed out, "Today, no major power would tolerate such open aggression for a moment. In the past, these facts alone would have been sufficient grounds for war."

    He recounted China's historical rights to Taiwan, which prompted the Allied powers to restore China's sovereignty over Taiwan after the most recent World War. He advocated recognizing the People's Republic of China and recognizing its eligibility for a seat in the United Nations.

    美国人民反对美国统治集团侵略中国的行为
    福斯特和杜波依斯斥责美国的侵略政策
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社纽约十一日讯：美国统治集团对中华人民共和国所采取的侵略行动正不断地遭到国内的反对。
      “工人日报”驻费城记者报道，国际妇女争取和平自由同盟全国委员会最近通过了一项决议，反对把美国陆海空军派到台湾海峡去。这个同盟在谴责国会的规定干涉中国内政的决议时，敦促美国政府参加有关国家的国际会议以拟出台湾问题的最后的和令人满意的解决办法。
      “工人日报”写道：新泽西州的进步党组织认为国会决议赋予艾森豪威尔的广泛权力是“和平解决这个问题的最大的障碍”。
    “旧金山纪事报”刊登了若干来信，写信的人都指责美国的行动。例如，旧金山的伊·弗莱德曼写道，美国武装部队是因为安全的考虑才占领台湾的论点是“违反更正确的逻辑的”。
    同样的信件正寄给美国国会议员。“新闻周刊”上刊登的一篇文章里承认，美国老百姓都对美国政府目前在远东的政策表示担忧，并且反对美国武装部队占领台湾和澎湖。
    【新华社柏林十二日电】纽约消息：美国共产党主席威廉·福斯特二月七日在纽约“工人日报”上发表文章说：美国就台湾问题提出的“停火”建议遭到了人民中国的激烈反对，这是理所当然的。停火只能在自由谈判的基础上，而不是在温顺地接受美国的命令的基础上达成。美国必须把它的部队撤出中国的领土台湾；联合国也必须把蒋介石匪帮赶出这个组织去；同时它也必须使人民中国取得它在安全理事会中应有的地位。这是适合于一个自由和有主权的国家的人民的回答。
    福斯特指出，在面临中国人民的勇敢态度的情况下，美国的卤莽的黩武主义者企图使人们看来美国受到人民中国的很大侮辱。但是这是荒谬的。甚至稍微考虑一下中国情况的现实，就可以毫无疑问地看出，是美国政府对中华人民共和国进行了一系列的粗暴侵略行动。
    同一天的“工人日报”报道说，美国著名黑人历史学家、和平战士杜波依斯写信给美国全国的报纸编辑说，美国在台湾问题上的立场是站不住脚的，而且是公开的侵略。
    他向全国的编辑问道：“根据什么牵强附会的逻辑能够把在同美国相对的地球那一边的台湾认为是保护我们西部国境所必要的呢？”他建议编辑们设身处地想想，如果在美国的沿海有一个“敌人拥有的、它决心要用来进攻我们的”像荷兰那么大的岛屿，另外还有一些也是被同一敌人构筑了工事的一再用来发动进攻的较小的沿海岛屿，那我们将怎么办呢？他说：“这将是危险的。”
    他指出，“今天任何大国对这种公开的侵略片刻也容忍不了。在过去，单单这些事实就已经可以构成发生战争的充分理由了。”
    他追述了中国对台湾的历史权利，这种权利促使各盟国在最近一次世界大战以后恢复了中国对台湾的所有权。他主张承认中华人民共和国，并且承认它有资格取得联合国的席位。
