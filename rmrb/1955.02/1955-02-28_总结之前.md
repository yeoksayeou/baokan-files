    Before Summarizing
    Kong Sang
    The director of the Zichuan Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Shandong Province wrote in his quarterly work summary: "Under the unified leadership of the Party, thanks to the active efforts and brainstorming of our employees, we successfully overcame the challenges of this quarter and overfulfilled our production tasks..."
    The director put a lot of effort into the summary, finally managing to make it sound coherent. Unexpectedly, when he convened the bureau affairs meeting and checked the data, he found that the total value of production tasks was still several million yuan short, and there was no "overfulfillment" whatsoever.
    Some of our cadres summarize in this way: they don't bother to study the situation and problems in their work, and they don't even know whether the production tasks have been completed or not. They can pick up a pen and write a summary that claims "overfulfilled production tasks," and not only can they write a summary, but they can also summarize a whole bunch of "experiences." We often see such summaries and experiences: whenever a quality accident exhibition is held, it inevitably "educates all employees and raises the masses' quality awareness"; even before the leader finishes his report on the stage, a line of experience has already appeared in the draft of the summary: "The leadership attaches great importance, personally takes action, and deeply mobilizes the masses"; if Zhang San's deeds are praised once on the blackboard newspaper, another experience is added to the summary: "Cultivating typical examples, establishing banners, using the advanced to drive the backward, from point to surface, promoting the overall situation..."
    According to them, life is always a mechanical movement, just like a pendulum always swinging left and right. As long as an accident exhibition is organized, regardless of its effectiveness, it will inevitably "receive profound education"; as soon as you make a mobilization report, they are sure to be "deeply mobilized." How simple life is, how easy leadership is, how easy summarizing is.
    Unfortunately, actual things are often not so simple. Even the best mobilization report may not be able to get through to everyone's minds. Although quality accident exhibitions are a vivid way to improve the masses' quality awareness, they are not a panacea and cannot cure all ills. When Zhang Zhenyang of Baotou Construction Company visited the concrete quality accident exhibition at the local joint shopping mall, he not only did not "improve his quality awareness," but instead said, "We couldn't even make it this bad with our eyes closed." Subsequently, a serious concrete quality accident occurred in the expansion project of the Baotou Machinery Factory's foundry workshop, which he was responsible for.
    Life is a complex struggle. The masses are in action, and there will be rich experiences, which do need to be summarized. However, before starting to summarize, we should learn more about the masses' thoughts and get more in touch with real life. Otherwise, although we can write summaries and summarize ten or eight experiences, we will inevitably make the same mistake as the director of the Zichuan Post and Telecommunications Bureau. Making a fool of oneself is a small matter, but ten or eight "experiences" such as "leadership attaches importance," which are dazzling, can easily blind people's eyes. Then, while you are indulging in self-intoxication in your summary, bad things can happen in life.

    总结之前
    孔桑
    山东省淄川邮电局局长在季度工作总结中写道：“在党的统一领导下，由于员工同志们的积极努力，开动了脑筋，胜利渡过了这一季度，超额完成了生产任务……”。
    局长做总结，煞费苦心，总算弄得头头是道。不料召集局务会议，一查资料，生产任务总值还差好几百万元，根本没有完成，“超额”更没有影子。
    我们有一些干部是这样做总结的：他们不去研究工作中的情况和问题，甚至连生产任务是不是完成了都不知道，拿起笔来就能写“超额完成生产任务”的总结，不但能写总结，而且能总结出一大堆“经验”来。常见这样的总结和经验：每当举办质量事故展览，必然是“教育了全体职工，提高了群众的质量观点”；甚至首长在台上报告未完，总结的腹稿中早出现了一条经验：“领导重视、亲自动手、深入发动了群众”；黑板报上表扬了一次张三的事迹，总结上又多了一条体会：“培养典型、树立旗帜、以先进带动落后，由点到面、推动全盘……”
    照他们看来，生活永远是机械的动作，就好像钟摆总是左右摇摆一样，只要是组织了事故展览，不问成效如何，必然“受到深刻教育”，你刚做了动员报告，他一定被“深入发动了”。生活是多么简单，领导是多么轻松，总结是多么容易。
    不幸的是，实际事物常常并不简单，再好的动员报告，并不一定能打通每一个人的思想。质量事故展览虽是提高群众质量观点的生动方法，也毕竟不是万应灵丹，不能药到病除。包头建筑公司的张振洋参观当地联合商场的混凝土质量事故展览时，不仅没有“提高了质量观点”，反说：“咱们闭上眼睛也打不成这样”，接着，他所负责的包头机械厂铸工车间扩建工程就发生严重的混凝土质量事故。
    生活是复杂的斗争。群众在行动，就会有丰富的经验，确实需要总结。不过，动手总结之前，要多去了解一下群众思想，多去接触一下实际生活。否则，虽然也能写出总结来，也能总结出十条八条经验，但总免不了要闹和淄川邮电局局长一样的笑话。闹笑话事小，十条八条诸如“领导重视”之类的“经验”，琳琅满目，却容易把人的眼睛蒙蔽起来，那时，你在总结里自我陶醉，生活中什么坏事都能发生。
