    It Will Definitely Happen!
    By Li He, Our Correspondent in Moscow
    In March 1950, the train stations along the Siberian Railway still displayed slogans and pictures celebrating Sino-Soviet friendship. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance had just been signed, and Chairman Mao had only recently returned to China from the Soviet Union. On a train from Atpul to Moscow, we, as Chinese people, were met with friendly glances from the Soviet people on board wherever we went. They gathered around us, offering greetings and discussing matters related to China.
      "Does China have a constitution after liberation?" they asked.
      "For the time being, we only have the Common Program," we replied.
      "It will definitely have one. It will definitely have one. Just like we have our own constitution," they said.
    "What is the situation in Taiwan?" they asked.
      "Taiwan is still occupied by the American aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. We are determined to liberate it," we replied.
    "It will definitely be liberated. It will definitely be liberated. Just like your army liberated the Chinese mainland," they said.
    It is no coincidence that on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the founding of our country, when the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, which consolidates the achievements of the people's revolution, was promulgated, the Soviet people wholeheartedly congratulated our people on this great event. This joyous occasion was something they had long anticipated.
    It is no coincidence that when the American aggressors continued to occupy our Taiwan, concluding the so-called "Mutual Security Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, viciously attempting to use Taiwan as a springboard to obstruct the Chinese people's efforts to build a happy life, the Soviet people, who have always been concerned about the fate of Taiwan, angrily denounced the American robbers, fully supporting the just demand of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, and were confident that the Chinese people would realize this aspiration.
  Opposing the American imperialists' revival of West German militarism, opposing their preparation for atomic war, and opposing their occupation of Taiwan are the focus of current Soviet public opinion. This reflects the Soviet people's firm will and unremitting efforts to defend world peace.
    F. Tolgaro, a tunneling worker at the No. 6 mine of the Donbass Kaziyev Coal Trust, wrote in a letter to "Labor News": "We Soviet people understand the feelings of the Chinese people. We know how the imperialists once tried to strangle the world's first Soviet state, how they supported the reactionaries driven out of our country, and how they once tried to establish bases on our territory. But the experience of the Soviet people proves that the people are invincible. People detest thieves who break into their houses. But people even more strongly resent those who infringe on their rights, who infringe on the freedom and independence of their motherland. The liberation of Taiwan is the just and noble cause of the Chinese people. Since this cause is just, victory will surely come. That is why I believe that Taiwan will be reunited with the free and peaceful Chinese mainland."
    Lieutenant Colonel A. Leontiev exposed Eisenhower's blackmail of China in the US Congress on January 24 in "Red Star". Leontiev said: "The American aggressors want to intimidate the Chinese people, want to prevent them from completing their sacred mission—liberating Taiwan, which has been Chinese territory since ancient times. But this is a futile attempt. The Chinese people cannot be deceived or intimidated. The powerful new China can crush any conspiracy of the American aggressors. ... Not long ago, the People's Liberation Army liberated Yijiangshan Island, giving the Chiang bandits on Dachen Island a fatal blow."
    The liberation of Yijiangshan and the opening of the Kangzang and Qingzang highways have made the Soviet people happy. Tolgaro the miner, Lieutenant Colonel Leontiev, and tens of millions of Soviet people, oppose imperialist interference in our internal affairs, closely watching every step of our country's industrialization, watching how our country is learning from the Soviet Union's experience. No one knows better than the Soviet comrades that socialist industrialization centered on heavy industry is the basis for developing the national economy, strengthening national defense, and improving people's lives.
    It is also necessary to mention the following. The Soviet Union put forward the task of large-scale development of consumer goods industry and agriculture in 1953. Important documents of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have repeatedly emphasized that this can only be achieved on the basis of greatly developing heavy industry and continuing to greatly develop heavy industry. It would be wrong for anyone to think that the Soviet national economy is now centered on the development of light industry. D. Shepilov recently criticized the erroneous views of individual Soviet economists who misinterpreted the party's general line in "Pravda". These scholars asserted that the Soviet Union entered a new stage of economic development in 1953, the essence of which seems to be a fundamental change in the party's economic policy, from adhering to the development of heavy industry to focusing on the development of light industry. These scholars suggested that in the transition to communism, either maintain the same rate of development for light industry and heavy industry, or ensure that the development of light industry takes precedence over the development of heavy industry. Shepilov pointed out: If similar views are disseminated, it will completely disorient cadres on the basic issues of the party's economic policy. "Guided by Marxism-Leninism, the party has accelerated the production of means of production, promoted heavy industry, and on this basis ensured the strong development of the national economy, because heavy industry was, is, and will always be the cornerstone of the development of all sectors of the socialist economy, the foundation of the Soviet state's strength and the foundation of the people's welfare."
    We have been to Soviet factories, mines and construction sites more than once. When you inquire about the work and life of workers and engineers, they also want you to answer about China's construction and workers' lives, even if it is only in a few words. When you experience the scale of Soviet industrialization, the Soviet comrades who lead or receive you always inquire with concern whether China now has similar enterprises. We answered truthfully, "Not yet"; or "Just starting construction". They always said with certainty: "There will definitely be one, and it will definitely be built successfully."
    You can't help but nod in emotion. How can you not be moved? When you imagine that your own country will have the same scale of socialist economic foundation; when you see that Soviet comrades are eager for China to establish the "lifeline" of a socialist country, just like those Chinese patriots who shed blood and sacrificed themselves for the people's revolution; when you encounter the machines manufactured and the talents trained for the 156 industrial enterprises being built in our country.
    But the Soviet comrades' conviction is not only based on their determination to help our country build, but also on their love for the qualities of our people. Recently, "Pravda", "Labor News", and "Izvestia" have successively published many articles about visits to China. The Soviet press delegation pointed out that organization, humility, and love of labor are the characteristics of the Chinese people that they have noticed. Delegation member L. Dolgunov wrote in his visit notes: "Chinese workers and engineers praise Soviet technology. Indeed, the most modern equipment is being shipped from Soviet factories to China. However, the matter is certainly not just about technology. The matter lies in the people who master the technology, in the millions of workers who complete the great task. They are so inspired by free labor, and they have such a love and creative attitude towards technology, that they are able to fully use the technology." He went on to write: "There is also something that helps Chinese comrades to quickly build industry, and that is humility. Yes, it is humility, the content of which is not that people underestimate their own abilities, but that while knowing their strengths, they fight against backward pride and complacency, and wholeheartedly overcome difficulties. Here also is shown the revolutionary courage of the Chinese Communists, their organic unity with the working people."
    Many of our comrades have asked Soviet agricultural workers for advice on the Soviet experience in agricultural collectivization. As the Soviet writer Sholokhov said in his letter to our readers, Soviet agricultural collectivization was a magnificent and grand mass movement, with specific characteristics in various places. Therefore, the request to describe the historical story of the collectivization movement often makes Soviet comrades feel embarrassed. It is the reason for the Soviet comrades' caution not to distort this major change in the Soviet countryside after the October Revolution, and not to allow Chinese comrades to misunderstand it. I remember that when our land reform had just been completed and agricultural production cooperatives had not yet developed on a large scale, I met a district party secretary at a collective farm in the Moscow region. When he talked about the Soviet experience in agricultural collectivization, he repeatedly emphasized the need to raise the awareness of the peasants, not to fall behind the peasant masses, and not to be rash. He said: "Today you don't have to take detours." Now, the Soviet countryside knows more about the fact that our country's agriculture is following the path of cooperation and collectivization. When meeting with members of Soviet collective farms, we often hear these words: "Chinese peasants will take the path of cooperation and collectivization, and they will definitely have the same happy days as us. They will definitely have them." This is not just general polite talk. It is a conclusion drawn from their own experience.
    In the past year, dozens of delegations from China and the Soviet Union have visited each other. It has created a new peak in friendship and cultural exchange. After the Soviet State Moscow Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Musical Theatre returned to Moscow from Beijing, the director, G. Polivikov, said in "Soviet Culture News": "From the first minute of stepping on Chinese soil until the day of returning home, everyone felt that they were in an atmosphere of admiration and friendship, in an atmosphere of sincere goodwill, which is the feeling cultivated by the 600 million great Chinese people for the Soviet people." The Soviet people recently welcomed the performances of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe, the holding of Chinese Film Week, and the exhibition of Chinese arts and crafts with the same friendly feelings. Soviet translators and readers are waiting for good new works of Chinese literature to be published. When talking with Soviet comrades about our country's literature and art, we do not hide the fact that our country is lagging behind objective requirements in this regard. But they always unhesitatingly praise every achievement of our culture, and say that with our efforts, a new high tide of culture will definitely come.
    While receiving the encouragement of Soviet comrades, we feel that we should humbly strive to improve and raise the existing level in the praise of friends. The films that our country shows in the Soviet Union mainly rely on political and ideological proximity to Soviet audiences. As for the lengthy dialogues, monotonous or even superfluous scenes, and the lack of expressions of emotions from the heart, this series of problems needs to be greatly improved in order to meet the requirements of Soviet audiences. The leader of the Soviet Army Song and Dance Troupe, B. Alexandrov, praised the performance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe in "Pravda", and wrote: "We have no doubt that all those positive and good things that the song and dance troupe and its leaders have done during their short period of activity are a guarantee for the further perfection of the entire troupe." "Further perfection" - is to encourage our song and dance troupe, which has returned with honor, to make further efforts. B. Akimov, a worker at the Moscow Kuibyshev Factory, left a message in the visitor's book after visiting our country's arts and crafts exhibition, saying: "The art of the Chinese people leaves a deep impression. I especially like ivory carvings, wood carvings and silver carvings. I hope to see more works with modern themes." "More works with modern themes" - isn't this a suggestion worthy of being remembered in the development of our country's arts and crafts?
    As the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is approaching, I can't help but recall the voices of Soviet comrades, full of confidence, penetrating all the words: "It will definitely...". In the words "It will definitely...", the Soviet people see Chinese people as their own people, and the Soviet people trust the strength of the Chinese people as they trust their own strength. Comrade Voroshilov's New Year's Day essay for the "People's Daily", "Advancing Along the Glorious Road of Socialism", which was reprinted in all the Soviet national newspapers, said: "No force in the world can make the Chinese people leave the path they have chosen. And the attempts of American imperialism to stop and hinder the great movement of the Chinese people towards socialism will ultimately be futile. This struggle is doomed to failure."
    As long as we work hard, we will definitely liberate Taiwan, we will definitely build China into a great socialist country, we will definitely!

专栏：

    一定会！
    本报驻莫斯科记者  李何
    一九五○年三月，西伯利亚铁路沿线各车站还挂着庆祝中苏友好的标语和图画。中苏友好同盟互助条约才签订不久，毛主席才从苏联回到中国没有几天。在一趟从阿特普尔到莫斯科的列车上，我们作为中国人，走到那里，同车的苏联人总是投来亲切的眼光，围拢来，问候着，谈论中国的事情。
      “中国解放后有了宪法吗？”他们问。
      “暂时只有共同纲领。”我们答。
      “一定会有的。一定会有的。就像我们有自己的宪法一样。”他们说。
    “台湾情形怎样？”他们问。
      “台湾还在美国侵略者和蒋介石匪帮的盘踞下。我们是要解放它的。”我们答。
    “一定会解放的。一定会解放的。就像你们的军队解放中国大陆一样。”他们说。
    不是偶然的，在我国成立五周年前夕，巩固人民革命成果的中华人民共和国宪法产生的时候，苏联人民打从心坎高兴地祝贺我国人民的大喜事。这个喜事是他们早就预料到的。
    不是偶然的，当美国侵略者继续侵占我国的台湾，同蒋介石匪帮缔结所谓“共同安全条约”，恶毒地企图把台湾作为阻挠我国人民建设幸福生活的跳板时候，一直关心台湾的命运的苏联人民，愤怒地斥责美国强盗，完全支持我国人民解放台湾的正义要求，确信我国人民一定会实现这个愿望。
  反对美国帝国主义者复活西德军国主义，反对它准备原子战争和反对它侵占台湾，是苏联当前舆论的中心。这反映着苏联人民保卫世界和平的坚决意志和不懈的努力。
    顿巴斯卡兹也夫煤业托拉斯第六号矿井的掘进工人弗·托尔加洛写给“劳动报”的信中说：“我们苏联人了解中国人民的心情。我们知道，帝国主义者曾经怎样企图窒杀世界上第一个苏维埃国家，他们怎样支持了从我们国内赶出去的反动派，曾经怎样企图在我们国土上建立基地。可是苏联人民的经验证明，人民是不可战胜的。人们嫌恶钻进房里的小偷。可是人民更强烈地愤恨那侵犯他们权利的人，侵犯他们祖国的自由和独立的人。解放台湾是中国人民的正义和崇高的事业。既然这个事业是正义的，胜利一定会随着到来。这就是为什么我相信，台湾将会同自由的和平的中国大陆重新统一起来。”
    亚·列昂捷夫中校在“红星报”上揭发了艾森豪威尔一月二十四日在美国国会上对中国的讹诈行为。列昂捷夫说：“美国侵略者想恐吓中国人民，想阻挠他们完成自己的神圣使命——解放自古以来是中国的领土台湾。可是这是占不到便宜的企图。中国人民是欺骗不了也恐吓不了的。强大的新中国能够粉碎美国侵略者的任何诡计。……不久前中华人民共和国部队解放了一江山岛，给了大陈岛上的蒋匪阵地以致命的打击。”
    一江山的解放，康藏、青藏公路的通车，都使苏联人民欢喜。托尔加洛矿工、列昂捷夫中校和千千万万苏联人，反对帝国主义干涉我国内政，密切地注视着我国工业化的每一步的进展，注视着我国学习苏联这方面经验的情形。没有人比苏联同志更知道，以重工业为中心的社会主义工业化是发展国民经济、加强国防力量和提高人民生活的基础了。
    顺便也必须提到下面一件事情。苏联在一九五三年提出了大规模发展日用品工业和农业的任务。苏联共产党的重要文件一再着重指出，这只有在大大发展了重工业并且继续大大发展重工业的基础上才能实现。有人如果以为现在苏联国民经济是以发展轻工业为中心，那就错了。德·谢皮洛夫最近在
  “真理报”上批评了苏联个别经济学者曲解党的总路线的错误观点。这些学者断定：苏联从一九五三年起进入了经济发展的新阶段，这个阶段的实质似乎是党的经济政策的根本改变，从坚持发展重工业改变为以发展轻工业为中心。这些学者建议：在过渡到共产主义时期，或者使轻工业和重工业保持同等的发展速度，或者保证轻工业的发展优先于重工业的发展。谢皮洛夫指出：如果类似的观点得到传播，那会使干部在党的经济政策的基本问题上完全迷失方向。“以马克思列宁主义为指针，党以加快的速度推进了生产资料的生产，推进了重工业，并且在这个基础上保证国民经济的强度发展，因为重工业过去是，现在是，将来还是保证社会主义经济一切部门发展的基石，苏联国家的强大和人民福利的基础之基础。”
    我们不只一次到了苏联的厂矿和工地。你询问工人和工程师们的工作和生活，他们也要你回答中国的建设和工人的生活，那怕是三言两语。在你领略苏联工业化的规模时候，带路的或接见的苏联同志总是关心地询问中国现在有没有类似的企业了。我们照实回答，“还没有”；或者“才开始建设”。他们总是确信地说：“一定会有的，一定会建设成功的。”
    你不能不感动地点点头。怎么能不感动呢？当你想像自己国家将有同样规模的社会主义经济基础的时候；当你看到苏联同志像那些为人民革命流血牺牲的我国志士一样渴望中国建立起社会主义国家的“命根子”的时候；当你遇到为我国建设的一百五十六项工业企业制造的机器和培养的人材的时候。
    但是苏联同志的这种确信，不单建立在援助我国建设的决心上，而且建立在对我国人民的品质的喜爱上。最近，“真理报”、“劳动报”、“消息报”连续发表了许多篇中国访问记。苏联报刊工作者代表团指出，组织性、谦逊和爱好劳动是他们所注意到的中国人民的特点。团员列·多尔古诺夫在访问记中写道：“中国工人和工程师称赞苏联的技术。的确，从苏联工厂向中国运去的是最新式的设备。可是，事情当然不单在于技术。事情在于掌握技术的人，在于完成伟大任务的千百万劳动者。他们受着自由劳动的这样的鼓舞，对技术抱着这样爱好和创造的态度，因而能够充分地使用技术”。他接着写道：“还有件东西帮助中国同志迅速建设工业，这就是谦逊。是的，正是谦逊，它的内容不是人们低估自己的能力，而是在知道自己的强处的同时向落后的骄傲和自满作斗争，全心全意克服困难。这里也显现了中国共产党人的革命胆略，他们同劳动人民的有机的团结。”
    我们有不少同志向苏联农业工作者请教苏联农业集体化的经验。就像苏联作家萧洛霍夫在给我国读者的信中所说的，苏联农业集体化是壮丽雄伟的广大人民群众运动，各地还有具体的特点。所以叙述集体化运动的历史故事的要求，常常使苏联同志感到为难。不能把十月革命后苏联农村的这个重大变革说走样了，不能使中国同志领会偏差了，这是苏联同志谨慎的缘由。记得在我国土地改革才完成，农业生产合作社还没有大规模发展的时候，在莫斯科州一个集体农庄会见了一位区委书记。他谈到苏联农业集体化的经验，一再关照要提高农民的觉悟程度，不要落后于农民群众，也不要冒进。他说：“今天你们是不用走弯路了。”现在，苏联农村较多地知道我国农业在走合作化集体化的道路。同苏联集体农庄庄员会面时候，常听到这样的话：“中国农民走合作化集体化的道路，一定会有和我们一样幸福的日子。一定会有。”这不是一般寒喧的应酬话。它是从自己的体验中得来的结论。
    最近一年，中苏两国各有几十个代表团互相访问。它造成了友谊和文化交流的新高峰。苏联国立莫斯科斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基与聂米罗维奇—丹钦科音乐剧院从北京回到莫斯科后，院长格·波利维科夫在“苏维埃文化报”上说：“从踏进中国土地的第一分钟起直到回国的日子，我们每个人都感觉到：是处在爱慕和友好的气氛中，处在热诚的好意的气氛中，这是六万万伟大的中国人民培育的对苏联人民的感情。”苏联人民以同样友好的心情，最近欢迎了中国人民解放军歌舞团的表演、中国电影周的举行、中国工艺美术品的展览。苏联的翻译工作者和读者等待着新出的中国文学的好作品，在和苏联同志交谈我国文学和艺术时候，我们不掩饰我国在这方面存在着落后于客观要求的事实。但是他们总是不迟疑地称赞我国文化的每一点成就，并说随着我们的努力，文化的新高潮一定会到来。
    在领受苏联同志的鼓励的同时，就觉得我们应该谦逊地在朋友的赞扬中力求改进和提高现有的水平。我国在苏联演出的影片，主要是依靠政治思想接近苏联观众，至于冗长的对话，单调甚至多余的场面，缺少从内心溢露出来的表情的动作，这一系列问题，是需要大大改进，才能满足苏联观众的要求的。苏军歌舞团领导人鲍·亚历山大罗夫在“真理报”上盛赞我国人民解放军歌舞团的演出，同时写道：“我们不怀疑，所有那些在歌舞团及其领导在较短的活动期间所做的肯定的好的东西，是全团进一步走向完善的保证。”“进一步走向完善”——就是鼓励载誉归来的我们歌舞团进一步的努力。莫斯科古比雪夫工厂一位工人布·阿基莫夫在参观我国工艺美术展览会以后在意见簿上留字说：“中国人民的艺术留下深刻的印象。特别喜欢牙刻、木刻和银刻。希望将看到更多的现代题目的作品。”“更多现代题目的作品”——不正是我国工艺美术品发展中值得记取的建议吗？
    在中苏友好同盟互助条约签订五周年快要到来的时候，我不禁回忆起苏联同志这些充满信心的贯穿在所有话语中的声音：“一定会……”。在“一定会……”这句话中，苏联人看中国人和自己人一样，苏联人民信赖中国人民的力量像信赖自己的力量一样。苏联全国报纸都转载的伏罗希洛夫同志元旦为“人民日报”作的论文“沿着社会主义的光荣道路前进”中说：“世界上没有任何力量可以使中国人民离开他们所选择的道路。而美帝国主义竭力制止和阻碍中国人民走向社会主义的伟大运动也终不过是徒劳而已。这一挣扎是注定要失败的。”
    只要我们努力，我们一定会解放台湾，一定会把中国建设成伟大的社会主义国家，一定会！
