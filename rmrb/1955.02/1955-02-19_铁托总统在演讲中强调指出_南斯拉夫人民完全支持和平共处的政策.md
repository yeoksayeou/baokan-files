Xinhua News Agency, February 18th: According to the Yugoslav News Agency, President Tito of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia returned to Yugoslavia on the 11th after a seventy-four-day visit to India and Burma. He has since delivered public speeches in Zagreb, Belgrade, and other places.

In his speeches, Tito said that the forces of peace in the world are now stronger than the forces of war. He pointed out that this is the reason why Yugoslavia is dedicated to the cause of peace.

Tito spoke about his trip to Asia, saying that it is very important to bring as many countries as possible together under a policy of maintaining peace and mutual cooperation.

Tito discussed the issue of peaceful coexistence. He said: If we want to prevent a new disaster, the only way out is active peaceful coexistence between countries and between nations. Every nation has the right to exist on its own land, and no one has the right to interfere in its internal affairs. Only by stopping interference in internal affairs can peaceful coexistence be possible.

Tito added: Today, swords, atomic bombs, or hydrogen bombs cannot solve any problems. It is madness to think that one can defeat others with atomic bombs or hydrogen bombs without failing oneself in the conflict.

In his speech, Tito emphasized that the Yugoslav people fully support the policy of peaceful coexistence.

    铁托总统在演讲中强调指出
    南斯拉夫人民完全支持和平共处的政策
    【新华社十八日讯】据南斯拉夫通讯社消息：南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国总统铁托在印度、缅甸作了七十四天的访问后，已在十一日回到南斯拉夫。并且连续在萨格勒布、贝尔格莱德等地发表公开演讲。
    铁托在讲演中说，今天，世界上和平的力量已经比战争的力量更为强大。他指出，这是南斯拉夫效力于和平事业的原因。
    铁托谈到他这次去亚洲的旅行，他说，使得尽可能多的国家聚结在一个维护和平和互相合作的方针之下是非常重要的。
    铁托谈到和平共处的问题。他说：如果我们要防止一次新的灾难，唯一的出路就是国家和国家之间、民族和民族之间积极的和平的共处。每一个民族有权利在它自己的国土上生存，任何人没有权利干涉它的内政。只有停止干涉内政，和平共处才有可能。
    铁托又说：今天，刀剑、原子弹或氢弹不能解决任何问题。如果以为可以用原子弹或氢弹击败别人而自己不会在冲突中失败，那实在是发狂了。
    铁托在演讲中强调指出，南斯拉夫人民完全支持和平共处的政策。
