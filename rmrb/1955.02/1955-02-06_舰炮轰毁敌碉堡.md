　　Naval Guns Destroy Enemy Bunker

　　The PLA land forces that landed on Yijiangshan Island have occupied most of the positions of the Chiang bandit troops on the island, and victorious red flags are flying on many mountain peaks on the island. Only on Height 180 in South Yijiangshan did the stubborn resistance of the enemy's guns and cannons continue. At this time, the sailors of a naval fleet of our army, advancing to the sea area between Yijiangshan Island and Dachen Island, saw a bunker on this height, with a pole like a flagpole standing to the lower right of the bunker, and an independent house to the west of the pole. The firing holes of the bunker were constantly flashing, and the independent house was also firing shots outwards. At this time, the artillery fire accompanying our infantry's advance was bombarding this height, and the infantry soldiers were lying on the hillside, firing upwards.
　　The sailors were very anxious when they saw this situation, eager to immediately destroy the bunker with their own artillery fire. After studying the situation, the captain of the lead ship and the fleet commander decided to immediately use the ship's artillery fire to destroy the enemy's firepower points and support the army in quickly occupying this final height.
　　The warships quickly approached Yijiangshan Island and reported the battle plan to the commander via radio.
　　After receiving the firing order, the sailors immediately opened fire from all the ship's guns, and groups of shells flew continuously towards the same target, exploding violently on the enemy's bunker. The Chiang bandit troops' bunker on Height 180 was immediately completely overturned.
　　The sailors then shifted their fire to eliminate the enemy in the independent house.
　　Soon after the sailors cleared the final obstacle for the army units from the sea, the army soldiers finally victoriously occupied Height 180 and completely liberated Yijiangshan Island.

    舰炮轰毁敌碉堡
  　新华社记者　徐学增
    我军登上一江山岛的陆军部队已经占领了岛上蒋贼军的大部分阵地，岛上许多高山顶上都已飘扬起了胜利的红旗。惟有南一江山的一八零高地上还阵阵地传来敌人顽抗的枪炮声。这时，挺进到一江山岛和大陈岛之间海面上的我海军某舰队的水兵们看到这个高地上有一个碉堡，碉堡右下方立着一根像旗杆似的杆子，杆子西面有一间独立房子。碉堡的射击孔里不断闪着火光，独立房子里也往外打枪。这时，伴随我军步兵前进的炮火正在向这个高地上轰击，步兵战士们都卧在山坡上向上射击。
    水兵们看到这种情况后心里很着急，恨不得马上用自己的炮火轰毁这个碉堡。前导舰舰长和舰队指挥员研究后，决定立即用舰上炮火摧毁敌人的火力点，支援陆军迅速占领这个最后的高地。
    军舰迅速向一江山岛靠近，并从无线电里把战斗计划报告给指挥员。
    水兵们接到射击命令后，转眼工夫，军舰上各炮齐发，一群群炮弹连续地向着同一个目标飞去，猛烈地在敌人碉堡上爆炸了。一八零高地上蒋贼军的碉堡当即被全部掀翻了。
    水兵们接着又转移炮火消灭了独立房子里的敌人。
    水兵们从海上给陆军部队扫清了前进中的最后障碍后不久，陆军战士们终于胜利地占领了一八零高地，全部解放了一江山岛。
