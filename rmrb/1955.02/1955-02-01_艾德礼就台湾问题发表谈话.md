Xinhua News Agency, London, January 31st: British Labour Party leader and former Prime Minister Clement Attlee told a "Daily Herald" reporter on January 31st that he suggested exiling Chiang Kai-shek and his main followers from Taiwan to a "suitable haven" as the first step to end the war threat caused by the Taiwan issue. As a second relevant suggestion, Attlee advocated removing Taiwan from the U.S. "island defense circle."

Attlee said, "The Labour Party starts from the clear proposition that the Allied countries after the war have recognized that Taiwan is an integral part of China. The fact is clear that the Beijing government won the civil war with Chiang Kai-shek. If it had not been for American intervention, the Beijing government would have occupied Taiwan long ago." And this action by the United States was "completely unrelated to the United Nations."

In addition, Attlee also said at a meeting of the Labour Party parliamentary group on the evening of the 27th: "Taiwan is a part of China, and it cannot become an outpost of American defense."

However, after acknowledging that Taiwan belongs to China, Attlee disregarded this fact and put forward a proposition that the Chinese people can never agree to: handing over Taiwan to a neutral government to administer until the Taiwanese people decide through "voting" whether they want to join "Communist China."

Attlee also said, "Of course, it is obvious that, as we have often requested, the seat in the United Nations Security Council should be given to the People's Republic of China. As long as this seat is occupied by the Chiang Kai-shek puppet government, it will definitely be very difficult to negotiate."

    艾德礼就台湾问题发表谈话
    【新华社三十一日讯】伦敦消息：英国工党领袖、前首相艾德礼三十一日对“每日先驱报”记者发表谈话，建议把蒋介石和他的主要随从者从台湾流放到一个“适当的避难地”去，作为结束在台湾问题上引起战争威胁的第一步。作为第二个有关的建议，艾德礼主张把台湾从美国的“岛屿防御圈”中划出去。
    艾德礼说，“工党是从这样一种明确的主张出发的，那就是：战后盟国都已承认台湾是中国的一个组成部分。事实很清楚，北京政府赢得了和蒋介石进行的内战。如果没有美国的干涉，北京政府早就占有台湾了。”而美国的这个行动是“同联合国毫不相干”的。
    此外，艾德礼在工党议会党团二十七日晚举行的会议上也说：“台湾是中国的一部分，它不能成为美国防务的前哨。”
    但是，艾德礼在承认了台湾属于中国之后，却又不顾这一事实，提出了中国人民绝对不能同意的主张：把台湾交由某个中立的政府管理，直到台湾人民通过“投票”决定他们是否想加入“共产党中国”为止。
    艾德礼又说，“当然很明显，正如我们所经常要求的，联合国安全理事会中的席位应该交给中华人民共和国。只要这个席位被蒋介石傀儡政府占据着，进行谈判就一定是很困难的。”
