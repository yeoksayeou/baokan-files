Xinhua News Agency, London, 16th: According to TASS, a conference protesting the revival of German militarism was held at Holborn Town Hall in London on February 14th. Labor MP Sydney Silverman spoke at the meeting. He criticized the Labor Party leadership's support for the policy of arming West Germany, and emphasized that this is one of the main reasons for the current split in the Labor Party, because the vast majority of the British people and ordinary Labor Party members oppose arming West Germany. He believes that negotiations must be held with the Soviet Union, and that insisting on ratifying the Paris Accords would miss the opportunity for peace negotiations and put mankind at risk of new disasters.

    John Burns, a representative of the Fire Brigades Union, pointed out the need to unify Germany on the basis of free elections and to negotiate with the Soviet Union before ratifying the Paris Accords. He emphasized the importance of Britain pursuing an independent foreign policy that does not rely on the United States.

    MP Lena Jeger criticized the policy of "positions of strength" at the meeting. MPs Harold Davies and Benjamin Parkin also spoke at the meeting against arming West Germany and in favor of a peaceful resolution of international issues.

    On February 13th, representatives of political groups, social organizations, trade unions, and other groups with a total of 22,000 members held a meeting in London to oppose the rearmament of West Germany. MP John Baird strongly criticized the plan to revive German militarism at the meeting. The secretary of the Cooperative Party's London local organization suggested launching a campaign to demand acceptance of the Soviet Union's proposal for free elections in Germany. Delegates warned MP Austin Albu not to support the policy of reviving German militarism.

    "The Daily Worker" reported that Labor MP Thomas Oswald, who abstained from voting on the Paris Accords in the House of Commons, said at a rally in Edinburgh that he now realizes that he made a mistake in not voting against the Paris Accords. He believes that the Soviet Union's proposal for negotiations should be accepted, and pointed out that only the organized opposition of the working class can prevent the arming of West Germany.

    Trade unions and other social groups in Dundee sent a delegation to MPs John Strachey and George Morgan to protest the arming of West Germany. Strachey and Morgan both told the delegates that they opposed the revival of German militarism and that they were opposing such actions in the Labor Party parliamentary group.

    The Labor Party's Bristol district organization passed a resolution by an overwhelming majority demanding that the Labor Party's National Executive Committee convene an emergency meeting to reconsider its policy on the German question.

Xinhua News Agency, London, 17th: According to TASS, British Labor Party left-wing leader Bevan submitted a draft resolution to the House of Commons on the 15th, condemning the British government's refusal to negotiate with the Soviet Union on the German question before ratifying the Paris Accords. The draft resolution pointed out: "This rejection of the possibility of negotiations clearly demonstrates a failure to understand the seriousness of the threat to mankind."

    The draft resolution also expressed regret over the following: on April 5, 1954, the House of Commons unanimously passed a resolution instructing the British government to organize great power talks to discuss the reduction and control of armaments and to formulate policies to eliminate threats to residents around the world, but this resolution has not yet been implemented. The draft resolution said: "The House believes that the government's unwillingness to act in the spirit of this resolution is a sign of disrespect for the resolutions of the House."

    Bevan's proposal was supported by nearly one hundred Labor MPs in the House of Commons.

    英国人民纷纷集会坚决反对武装西德
    比万谴责英国政府拒绝同苏联就德国问题进行谈判
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：二月十四日，在伦敦的荷尔波恩市政厅举行了抗议复活德国军国主义大会。工党议员悉尼·锡尔弗曼在会上发了言。他批评了工党领导机构支持武装西德政策，并且着重指出：这是工党目前发生分裂的主要原因之一，因为绝大多数英国人民和工党普通党员都反对武装西德。他认为必须同苏联谈判，并且认为坚持批准巴黎协定就要错过和平谈判的机会，就要使人类有遭受新的灾难的危险。
    消防队联合会的代表约翰·伯恩斯指出了在自由选举的基础上统一德国以及在批准巴黎协定之前同苏联谈判的必要性。他强调英国奉行不依赖美国的独立外交政策的重要性。
    议员李娜·杰格在会上批评“实力地位”的政策。议员哈罗德·戴维斯和本杰明·帕金也在会上发言反对武装西德，赞成和平解决国际问题。
    二月十三日，共拥有二万二千个会员的政治团体、社会团体、工会和其他团体的代表在伦敦举行会议反对重新武装西德。议员约翰·贝尔德在会上猛烈抨击复活德国军国主义的计划。合作党伦敦地方组织的书记建议发起一个要求接受苏联关于德国自由选举的建议的运动。代表们警告议员奥斯丁·阿尔布：不要支持复活德国军国主义的政策。
    “工人日报”报道：在下院表决巴黎协定时弃权的工党议员托马斯·奥斯华德在爱丁堡的一次集会上说，他现在认识到他没有投票反对巴黎协定是犯了错误。他认为应该接受苏联关于举行谈判的建议，并且指出：只有工人阶级的有组织的反对，才能阻止武装西德。
    敦提的工会和其他社会团体派了一个代表团去见议员约翰·斯特拉彻和乔治·摩根，抗议武装西德。斯特拉彻和摩根都对代表们说，他们反对复活德国军国主义，他们正在工党议会党团中反对这种行动。
    工党布利斯托尔区的组织以压倒多数通过决议，要求工党全国执行委员会召开紧急会议来重新考虑对德国问题的政策。
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：英国工党左翼领袖比万在十五日向下院提出一个决议草案，谴责英国政府拒绝在批准巴黎协定前就德国问题同苏联谈判。决议草案指出：“对谈判的可能性的这种排斥，明显地证明不了解那种对人类的威胁的严重性。”
    决议草案还对下面这件事表示遗憾：一九五四年四月五日下院曾经一致通过一个决议，责成英国政府组织大国会谈，来讨论裁减和管制军备的问题以及制定消除对全世界居民的威胁的政策，但是这个决议到现在还没有执行。决议草案说：“下院认为：政府不愿照这个决议的精神行事就是不尊重下院的决议的表现。”
    比万的提案获得下院近一百个工党议员的支持。
