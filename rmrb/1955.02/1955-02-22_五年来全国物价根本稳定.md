According to statistics from the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China, from March 1950 to mid-February of this year, the national wholesale price index has remained below the level of March 1950. For example, taking the national wholesale price index of March 1950 as 100, it was 91.7 in December 1953 and 92.3 in December 1954. After the state implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain and cotton cloth in the winter of 1953 and the autumn of 1954, the prices of grain and cotton cloth have been completely stabilized. For example, in December 1954, the retail prices of standard flour and Xiaozhan rice in Beijing, Wufu fine cloth, and standard flour, Zhongbai Japonica rice, and Double Coin fine cloth in Shanghai were exactly the same as in December 1953. In the past two years, thanks to the vigorous development of production by our government and the development of trade with the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, sufficient materials have been secured, resulting in a reasonable decline in the prices of many industrial materials and equipment. In terms of non-staple foods, because the growth rate of the production of certain non-staple foods has not kept pace with the growth rate of consumption, there has been a phenomenon of supply falling short of demand and rising prices in the past year. However, through the active efforts of relevant departments to increase production, strengthen procurement and supply, carry out socialist transformation of private industrial and commercial enterprises, and strengthen market management, the prices of major non-staple foods are also becoming increasingly stable. Compared with the Spring Festival last year, the retail prices of major non-staple foods in Shanghai this Spring Festival, except for slight increases in pork and eggs, showed a decrease of 3.8% to 30% for beef, chicken, fish, vegetables, fruits, etc. (Xinhua News Agency)

    五年来全国物价根本稳定
    据中华人民共和国商业部统计，从一九五零年三月以后到今年二月中旬，全国批发物价总指数一直保持在一九五零年三月的水平以下。如以一九五零年三月全国批发物价总指数为一百，一九五三年十二月为九十一点七，一九五四年十二月为九十二点三。在一九五三年冬季和一九五四年秋季，国家分别对粮食、棉布实行统购统销以后，粮食、纱布的价格已完全稳定。如一九五四年十二月，北京市的标准面粉、小站米、五福细布和上海市的标准面粉、中白粳大米、龙头细布商品等的零售价格，完全和一九五三年十二月一样。近两年来，由于我国政府大力发展生产，并发展了同苏联和各人民民主国家之间的贸易，掌握了足够的物资，使很多工业器材的价格合理下落。在副食品方面，因为某些副食品生产增长的速度赶不上消费增长的速度，过去一年中，曾出现供不应求和价格上涨的现象。但经过有关部门积极增加生产，加强收购和供应，对私营工商业进行社会主义改造并加强市场管理工作，主要副食品的价格也日趋稳定。上海市今年春节主要副食品零售价格和去年春节比较，除猪肉、鸡蛋等略有上升外，牛肉、鸡、鱼、蔬菜、水果等下降了百分之三点八到百分之三十。　（新华社）
