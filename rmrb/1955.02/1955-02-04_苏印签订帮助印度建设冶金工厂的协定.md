Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 2nd: TASS reports that the talks held in Delhi between representatives of the Soviet and Indian sides were successfully concluded on February 2nd. As a result of the talks, the Soviet government and the Indian government signed an agreement on building a metallurgical complex in India with an annual output of one million tons of steel, with the potential for future expansion.

This plant will include the following main workshops: coking workshop, blast furnace workshop, steelmaking workshop, rolling mill workshop, sintering plant, as well as other auxiliary workshops and projects.

The first phase of the plant's construction stipulates that three coke ovens, two blast furnaces, two open-hearth furnaces, and a primary rolling mill should be put into production before the end of 1958, and other workshops should be put into production before the end of 1959.

The agreement stipulates that Soviet institutions are responsible for design work, for the production and supply of necessary equipment to India, and for technical guidance in the plant construction project, including equipment installation and commissioning.

In order to carry out work related to plant design, construction, and commissioning, Soviet institutions will send the necessary number of experts to India and will be responsible for training Indian personnel in India and the Soviet Union. In addition, Indian experts will be given the opportunity to visit metallurgical plants and enterprises producing metallurgical equipment in the Soviet Union.

The agreement stipulates that Indian industry should be utilized as much as possible to produce some of the equipment and materials needed for the construction of the metallurgical plant.

Indian institutions are responsible for the administrative leadership of the plant construction work, for preparatory work, and for ensuring the materials and labor required for construction.

To build this plant, the Soviet government will lend the Indian government a sum of money, which will be repaid in twelve years with an annual interest rate of 2.5 percent. The loan will be repaid in Indian rupees.

The agreement was signed by Soviet Ambassador to India M. A. Menshikov on behalf of the Soviet side, and by Secretary of the Indian Ministry of Production, Mr. Kla, on behalf of the Indian side.

This agreement on Soviet assistance to India in building a metallurgical plant is an important contribution to the development of mutually beneficial economic relations between the Soviet Union and India.
