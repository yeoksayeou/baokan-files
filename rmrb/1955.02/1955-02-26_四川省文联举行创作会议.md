    The Sichuan Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles held a creation conference in early February. More than 70 people, including professional artists and amateur writers, participated in the conference. The conference discussed the achievements and existing problems in last year's life and creative practice, and discussed the issues of two-act and one-act plays and experiencing life. In the discussion, the Party spirit of literature and art and the issue of literature and art serving politics were touched upon and clarified. The erroneous arguments of a few people who believed that "policies would hinder the creation of typical characters" and "anything can be written as long as it is reasonable" were criticized. Through discussion, everyone realized that conceptualization and formulaic writing are still common shortcomings in creation that need to be overcome. In terms of life practice, the insufficiently correct attitude towards life of a few authors was also criticized, such as wandering on the surface of life as bystanders, or only seeing the backward side of workers and peasants, but not seeing the growth of new moral qualities of people in the real struggle.
    Through discussion, everyone further realized the importance of strengthening political and artistic cultivation, and the importance of strengthening life practice and creative practice. The conference also stimulated everyone's creative enthusiasm, and the participants began to draw up this year's creative plans after the meeting.

    四川省文联举行创作会议
    四川省文学艺术工作者联合会在二月初举行创作会议，参加这次会议的有专业文艺工作者和业余作者共七十多人。会议讨论了去年在生活和创作实践中的成绩和存在的问题，讨论了两幕独幕剧和体验生活中的问题。在讨论中，接触并比较明确了文艺的党性、文艺为政治服务的问题，批判了少数人认为“政策会妨碍典型人物的创造”和“什么都可以写，只要写得合情合理就行”等错误论调。经过讨论，大家认识到概念化公式化仍然是创作中普遍存在的亟待努力克服的缺点。在生活实践方面，也批判了少数作者的不够端正的生活态度，例如以旁观者的态度游离于生活的表面，或只看到工农群众落后的一面，而看不到在现实斗争中新的人物道德品质的成长。
    通过讨论，大家进一步认识到加强政治修养和艺术修养的重要，加强生活实践和创作实践的重要。会议也激发了大家的创作热情，与会者在会后都开始订出了今年的创作计划。
