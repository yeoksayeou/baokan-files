Denouncing America's War Resolution
Wu Quan

The United States Congress has passed a provocative resolution authorizing the US president to intervene militarily in China's internal affairs. This resolution, following the US government's special message, is an arrogant war provocation against the People's Republic of China; it is entirely a war resolution.

The US President's special message is a new step in a series of steps taken by the US over the past few years to invade Chinese territory and interfere in China's internal affairs. This provocative message has, on the one hand, aroused war hysteria in the US Congress, and on the other hand, has inevitably caused serious unease.

According to an Associated Press report, during the Senate debate on the 26th, US Senator Flanders expressed concern that "this is a preemptive war."

Some congressmen have already had to consider the will of their voters. Congressman Celler explained his reason for voting against it, saying that he had promised the mothers in his district that he would not "vote to send their children to war on foreign soil." Even legislators who advocated for the swift approval of the special message, such as Speaker of the House Rayburn, could not help but state that it would be "very dangerous and embarrassing" if this became a precedent for the US president to request Congress' prior approval for actions he could take on his own as commander-in-chief.

During the House debate, some congressmen similarly pointed out that the proposal would allow the US to "enter China" and "guard" "hundreds of thousands of miles of land."

The facts irrefutably prove that the US government is asking Congress for the power to expand its aggression against the People's Republic of China in order to unscrupulously undermine peace in Asia and the world.

It is precisely for this reason that the warmongering clique in the US Congress has resorted to all means to restrict debate and reject all amendments aimed at narrowing the scope of authorization. No amendment, even if intended to serve US aggression policies, could satisfy the appetites of those war criminal candidates who are determined to use Taiwan as a springboard to expand aggression against China. This further exposes the war aims of the US Congressional resolution, the extreme hypocrisy of the special message's so-called "for peace" rhetoric, and the US ploy to use the United Nations to conduct a so-called ceasefire, which is an attempt to expand aggression against China under the banner of the United Nations and prepare for a new war.

The US Congressional resolution strives to deceive the people of the world and the American people by saying that the US can only "calm the situation down" by engaging in this kind of war adventure, and stubbornly claims that this is in line with the vital interests of the American people. However, the US aggressive clique has learned from many lessons that this hackneyed argument, used to cover up the evil consequences of "power politics," has long been bankrupt. American war provocations will definitely not intimidate the Chinese people, and will definitely not hinder the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan. The Chinese people are not intimidated and are not afraid of resisting wars of aggression. The war provocations of the US aggressive clique are completely against the interests of the American people, seriously threaten peace in Asia and the world, and lead the US itself to the edge of danger. It should be resolutely opposed by all peace-loving people and the American people.

    斥美国的战争决议
    吴全
    美国国会通过了授权美国总统武装干涉中国内政的挑衅性的决议。这个决议，继美国政府的特别咨文之后，是对中华人民共和国的狂妄的战争挑衅，它完全是一个战争决议。
    美国总统的特别咨文是美国这几年来侵略中国领土、干涉中国内政的一系列步骤中的新的步骤。这个挑衅性的咨文，在美国国会中一方面引起了战争歇斯底里的叫嚣，另一面也不能不引起严重不安的情绪。
    据美联社的报道，在二十六日参议院的辩论中美国参议员弗兰德斯表示担心“这就是先发制人的战争。”
    已经有议员不能不联想到选民的意志。众议员席勒解释他投反对票的理由时说，他已答应他的选区的母亲们，他不会“投票使她们的孩子们参加在外国土地上的战争的”。即使是主张迅速批准特别咨文的议员，像众议院议长雷朋也不能不表示，如果这成为美国总统要求国会在事先批准他作为总司令能够自行采取行动的一个先例，那将会是“非常危险和难堪的”。
    在众议院的辩论中，也同样有议员指出，提案将允许美国“进入中国”，“守卫”“几十万英里的土地”。
    事实无可辩驳地证明了美国政府是在向国会要求对中华人民共和国扩大侵略的权力，以便肆无忌惮地破坏亚洲和世界的和平。
    正是因为这样，美国国会中的好战集团，不惜使用各种手段，限制辩论，排除所有要求缩小授权范围的修正案。任何修正案，尽管都是为美国侵略政策打算的，都不能满足那些蓄意要拿台湾作跳板扩大侵略中国的战犯候选人的胃口。这就更加暴露了美国国会决议的战争目的，暴露了特别咨文所谓“为了和平”的一切掩饰言词的极端虚伪性，暴露了美国要联合国来进行所谓停火的诡计就是企图打着联合国的旗子来扩大对中国的侵略，准备新战争。
    美国国会决议竭力欺骗全世界人民和美国人民说，美国只有进行这种战争冒险，才能“使这种局势平息下来”，并且硬说这是符合美国人民的切身利益的。但是，美国侵略集团已经从不少的教训中知道，这种掩饰“实力政策”的恶果的陈腐论调，早已破产了。美国的战争挑衅，决然吓不倒中国人民，决然阻挠不了中国人民解放台湾的正义斗争。中国人民不受恫吓，也不怕反抗侵略战争。美国侵略集团的战争挑衅，是完全违背美国人民的利益的，它严重地威胁亚洲和世界的和平，并使美国自己走向危险的边缘。它应该受到所有爱好和平的人民和美国人民的坚决反对。
