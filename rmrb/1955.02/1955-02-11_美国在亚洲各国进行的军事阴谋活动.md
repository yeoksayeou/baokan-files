U.S. Intensifies Efforts to Expand Military Strength in Thailand and the Philippines
The United States is accelerating efforts to expand the armies of Thailand and the Philippines, particularly the reserve forces of these two countries.

According to Bangkok newspapers, Nai Charo, the Governor of Bangkok Prefecture in Thailand, said one day that Thailand plans to conscript 150,000 able-bodied men nationwide in April and incorporate them into "volunteer teams" for military training. He also said that the U.S. government has promised to provide the Thai government with weapons, equipment, and barracks construction funds for training the "volunteer teams."

According to Manila newspapers, the Philippine government is preparing to convene a meeting on February 20 to prepare for the organization of a "citizen army" of a reserve nature. Miguel R. Cornejo, the convener of this meeting, recently revealed that the Philippine authorities intend to expand the number of the "citizen army" to five million within five years. This means that if this plan is realized, most of the young and middle-aged men in the Philippines will be incorporated into the "citizen army." In addition, the Philippine military authorities will also establish so-called "civil defense organizations" to conscript residents for "civil defense training." Forty provinces and twenty-one cities have already established "civil defense organizations." In Manila, it is planned to conscript 100,000 people for this training.

At the same time, the United States is also urging Thailand and the Philippines to expand their armies and strengthen their navies and air forces.

In Thailand, the army is being reorganized according to the U.S. model, and the U.S. military advisory group in Thailand is training the Thai navy to use new weapons. The United States is also scheduled to deliver a batch of military jets to Thailand in February.

In the Philippines, the army plans to build a new division this year. On January 25, the U.S. authorities transferred a gunboat to the Philippine Navy. According to newspapers, the United States plans to give the Philippines a total of six gunboats and seventy-five jet aircraft in the near future to strengthen the Philippine Navy and Air Force.

Thai Mission in Laos Serves as Vanguard for U.S. Aggression
Hanoi, February 9 (Vietnam News Agency) - Radio Phaya and Radio Vientiane reported that a so-called goodwill mission led by General Daipratyus, Deputy Minister of Interior of the Thai government, arrived in Vientiane on February 4. The Thai mission has visited Luang Prabang, Xieng Khouang, and Pakse.

At a press conference, the Thai government mission revealed the military purpose of its trip. In answering a question about relations and assistance between the two countries, the Thai mission frankly announced that Laos and Thailand must act jointly in opposing communist activities and that the two countries will discuss military defense issues. The Thai mission also announced that Thailand would build two railways to the Lao border, one from Udon Thani to Nong Khai opposite Vientiane, and the other to Mourakhan opposite Savannakhet in Laos. These railways will connect Laos with Thailand's ports in the Gulf of Siam.

When asked whether Laos would join the Manila Treaty aggressive bloc, Prime Minister Katay of the Kingdom of Laos said that not only Laos but also other Southeast Asian countries must be included in this bloc.

Radio Vientiane broadcast Katay's answers to journalists on the 7th, in which Katay further announced that Thailand would complete the railway to Nong Khai by the end of this year.

All these signs indicate that the Thai government mission has obvious military purposes and is charged with the task of clearing the way for the U.S. to infiltrate Laos and turn it into a U.S. military base.

U.S. is Gradually Replacing France and Wants to Completely Control South Vietnam
The U.S.'s activities in South Vietnam to squeeze out France have aroused dissatisfaction among some French people.

Washington, February 5 (United Press) - U.S. officials admit to discord between French and U.S. representatives in Vietnam.

The report pointed out that the newly appointed French Governor-General of Algeria, Jacques Soustelle, recently accused the United States of trying to "Americanize" South Vietnam. He said that Ngo Dinh Diem "is completely dedicating himself to Washington" and wants to eliminate French influence.

The United Press report quoted some U.S. officials' remarks on this issue. Although these officials tried their best to cover up, they still admitted many facts that the United States is gradually replacing France. They admitted that the United States has obtained the power to "completely guide the training of the Vietnamese National Army"; Nguyen Van Hinh, the former Chief of Staff of the puppet army, "preferred by the French," was "finally dismissed" because he opposed Ngo Dinh Diem, who was supported by the United States. U.S. officials also "expect" that Ngo Dinh Diem, who is now directly receiving U.S. aid, "will probably want to purchase a large amount of materials from Japan," while South Vietnam "used to purchase most of its goods from French companies." They also expressed "dislike" for the French to trade with the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in order to exclude French enterprises in Indochina.

These U.S. officials blamed the French for "not being able to adapt" to the fact that South Vietnam has become "independent" from France and is controlled by the United States, and in turn, admonished the French to "get used to" it.

U.S. Attempts to Subvert the Current Government of Afghanistan
New Delhi, February 6 (Hindi "Today") - The United States is stepping up pressure on Afghanistan in order to pull it into the Middle East aggressive bloc it is planning.

"Today" said that although the United States has been exerting this kind of pressure on Afghanistan for quite some time, the United States has not achieved its goal because the Afghan government is implementing its own policies. "Today" pointed out that the United States, therefore, believes that the current government of Afghanistan is an "obstacle to the United States realizing its goals" and is now attempting to subvert the current government of Afghanistan and replace it with a government that can implement U.S. policies.

    美国在亚洲各国进行的军事阴谋活动
    美国加紧促使泰国和菲律宾扩充兵力
    美国正在加紧促使泰国和菲律宾扩充军队，特别是扩充这两个国家的后备兵力。
    据曼谷报纸报道，泰国曼谷府尹乃差罗一日说，泰国预定在四月间在全国各地开始征召十五万壮丁，编入“志愿队”施行军事训练。他并说，美国政府已经答应供给泰国政府作为训练“志愿队”用的武器装备和军营建筑费。
    据马尼拉报纸报道，菲律宾政府正准备在二月二十日召开筹备组织后备队性质的“公民军”的会议。这个会议的召集人米格尔·鲁·科尼霍最近透露，菲律宾当局打算在五年内把“公民军”人数扩大到五百万名。这就是说，如果这个计划实现，菲律宾全国的大部分青、壮年男子都要被编入“公民军”里。此外，菲律宾军事当局还要设立所谓“民防机构—来征集居民施行“民防训练”。已经有四十个省和二十一个市成立了“民防机构”。在马尼拉，预定要征集十万人施行这种训练。
    同时，美国还促使泰国和菲律宾扩充陆军和加强海、空军。
    在泰国，陆军正在按照美国的编制进行改编，美国驻泰国军事顾问团正在训练泰国海军使用新式武器。美国还预定在二月间运给泰国一批军用喷气机。
    在菲律宾，陆军方面准备在本年内增建一个师。美国当局一月二十五日将炮艇一艘移交给菲律宾海军当局。据报纸报道，美国打算最近一共给菲律宾炮艇六艘和喷气飞机七十五架，以加强菲律宾的海、空军。
      泰国使团在老挝为美国侵略充当马前卒
    据越南通讯社河内九日讯：法亚电台和万象电台报道，一个由泰国政府内政部副部长戴普拉第尤斯将军率领的所谓亲善使团已在二月四日到达万象活动。泰国使团已经访问了琅勃剌邦、川圹和巴沙地区。
    泰国政府使团在一个记者招待会上泄漏了它此行的军事目的。在回答一个关于两国间的关系和帮助的问题时，泰国使团直率地宣布，老挝和泰国必需在反对共产主义活动中联合行动，两国将要讨论军事防御问题。泰国使团还宣布泰国要修建两条通到老挝边境的铁路，一条从乌洞通到万象对岸的廊开，另一条将通到老挝沙湾拿吉对岸的莫拉项。这些铁路将使老挝和泰国在暹罗湾的港口连结起来。
    老挝王国政府首相克特在回答老挝是否要参加马尼拉条约侵略集团的问题时说，不仅是老挝而且是其他东南亚国家都必需包括在这一个集团里面。
    万象电台在七日广播了克特对新闻记者的回答，克特在回答中进一步地宣布泰国将在今年年底修成通到廊开的铁路。
    这些迹象都显示，泰国政府使团具有明显的军事目的，并且负有要为美国渗入老挝和把后者变为美国军事基地的阴谋扫清道路的任务。
      美国正一步步取代法国想完全控制南越
    美国在南越排挤法国的活动，已经引起一些法国人的不满。
    合众社华盛顿五日消息说：美国官员们承认在越南的法国和美国代表之间不和。
    消息指出：新任命的法国驻阿尔及利亚总督雅克·苏斯戴尔最近曾指责美国正在设法把南越
  “美国化”。他说，吴庭艳“正在把他自己完全奉献给华盛顿”，并且想排除法国的影响。
    合众社的消息引述了美国官员们就这个问题的一些谈话。这些官员虽然竭力掩盖，但还是承认了美国正在一步步取代法国的许多事实。他们承认：美国已经取得“完全指导越南国民军的训练工作”的权力；“法国人所偏爱的”前伪军陆军参谋长阮文馨，由于反对美国所支持的吴庭艳，“终于被革掉了职位”。美国官员们还“预料”现在直接接受美援的吴庭艳“大概将希望向日本购买大量物资”，而南越“过去是向法国公司购买大多数货物的”。他们还表示“不喜欢”法国人和越南民主共和国进行贸易，以便借此排斥在印度支那的法国企业。
    这些美国官员责怪法国人“还不能适应”南越从法国“独立”出去而为美国控制的事实，反过来训诫法国人应该“习惯”它。
      美国企图颠覆阿富汗现政府
    印度的印地文“今天报”六日报道，美国为了要把阿富汗拉进它策划的中东侵略集团，正加紧对阿富汗施加压力。
      “今天报”说，尽管美国对阿富汗施加这种压力已经相当久，但是由于阿富汗政府执行它自己的政策，美国并没有达到目的。“今天报”指出，美国因此就认为阿富汗现政府是“美国实现它的目标的障碍”，现在正企图颠覆阿富汗的现政府，而代以能执行美国政策的政府。（新华社）
