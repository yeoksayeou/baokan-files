The Electric Power Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the People's Republic of China is actively preparing to cultivate skilled technical personnel who can master new types of automated equipment for the years 1955, 1956, and 1957. This year, it plans to train a total of 9,071 reserve technical cadres and skilled workers, of which 3,768 are specifically for the 141 giant power station projects.

According to the requirements of the national economic construction plan for the development of the electric power industry, 84 giant power stations will be put into operation during these three years. This year, 28 key projects will be put into operation, including 7 belonging to the 141 projects; in 1956, 26 projects will be put into operation, including 5 belonging to the 141 projects; and in 1957, 30 projects will be put into operation, including 12 belonging to the 141 projects. These power stations are fully automated, requiring cadres and workers with sound scientific theory and skilled techniques to master the operation.

To meet the needs of the work, the Electric Power Administration Bureau sent 73 technical cadres and workers to the Soviet Union for internships last year. This year, it will send another 113 people, including factory directors, engineers, and skilled workers, to study abroad. In addition, 200 workers have been selected to go abroad for internships this year and next year. Last year, the Bureau established production education centers attached to automated power stations in Fushun, Fuxin, Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, Xi'an, Chongqing, and other places, specializing in cultivating cadres and workers who master scientific theory and advanced technology. Most of the trainees here are technical workers with a technical level of Grade 3 or above drawn from power plants across the country, and graduates from technical schools. The training at the production education center is divided into three stages. The first stage is to become initially familiar with the new equipment; the second stage is to deeply understand the operating procedures and systems and learn theoretical knowledge; the third stage is to participate in actual operation after passing the examination. The study period is one year. The third stage is the longest, accounting for 60 percent of the total study time. This learning method is very effective. This year, more than 1,000 technical cadres and technical workers will be selected to participate in the production education center. Next year, the Electric Power Administration Bureau also plans to establish a production education center in a hydropower station in a certain place to cultivate technical personnel for the hydropower stations that will be put into operation in the first five-year plan. The Electric Power Administration Bureau's directly affiliated Shenyang Technical School, Beijing Technical School, and Wuchang Technical School have trained more than 2,300 technical workers last year, and some of them have participated in actual work. This year, it plans to train more than 3,300 operators, maintenance personnel, and installation personnel for machinery, electricity, and furnaces. In addition, the Electric Power Administration Bureau also adopts professional training classes, entrusts basic construction engineering companies to train on its behalf, and uses the method of master teaching apprentices to cultivate reserve personnel for production units.

This year, the Electric Power Administration Bureau is training a total of 1,228 reserve personnel for basic construction, including technical talents in surveying, geology, hydrology and meteorology, chemical testing, and drawing, to serve the larger-scale machinery and electrical installation projects in the future.

    我国电业系统积极培养技术人才
    中华人民共和国燃料工业部电业管理总局，积极准备为一九五五、一九五六、一九五七年培养熟练的、能够掌握新型自动化装置的技术人才。今年计划培训后备技术干部和技术工人共九千零七十一名，其中三千七百六十八名是专为一百四十一项巨型电站培养的。
    根据国家经济建设计划对电业发展的要求，在这三年内将有八十四项巨型电站分别投入生产。今年内将投入生产的重点工程有二十八项，属于一百四十一项工程的有七项；一九五六年内将投入生产的有二十六项，属于一百四十一项工程的有五项；一九五七年内投入生产的有三十项，属于一百四十一项工程的有十二项。这些发电站完全是自动化的设备，必须有懂得科学理论、技术很熟练的干部和工人来掌握操作。
    电业管理总局为适应工作的需要，去年就已选派了七十三名技术干部和工人到苏联实习。今年又将选送厂长、工程师和技术工人等一百一十三人出国实习。另外还抽调了二百名工人，准备今年和明年出国实习。去年总局就在抚顺、阜新、太原、郑州、西安、重庆等地的自动化发电站附设了生产教育场，专门培养掌握科学理论和先进技术的干部和工人。到这里学习的学员，绝大多数都是从全国各电厂抽调的具有三级以上技术水平的技术工人和由技工学校毕业的学生。生产教育场的学习分三个阶段。第一阶段，初步熟悉新型设备；第二阶段，深入了解操作的规程制度，学习理论知识；第三阶段，经过考试合格者参加实际操作。学习时间为一年。第三阶段时间最长，占全部学习时间的百分之六十。这种学习方法效果很大。今年将抽调一千多名技术干部和技术工人，参加生产教育场学习。明年电业管理总局还准备在某地水电站建立一个生产教育场，为在第一个五年计划里投入生产的水电站培养技术人才。电业管理总局直属沈阳技工学校、北京技工学校、武昌技工学校，去年已经培养了二千三百多名技术工人，一部分人已参加了实际工作。今年准备培养三千三百多名机、电、炉的运行人员、检修人员和安装人员。另外，电业管理总局还采取专业训练班，委托基本建设工程公司代训、以及师父带徒弟等办法为生产单位培养后备人员。
    今年，电业管理总局为基本建设培养后备人员共一千二百二十八人，包括测量、地质、水文气象、化验、描图绘图等技术人才，为今后更大规模的机、电安装工程服务。
