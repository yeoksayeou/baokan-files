    PLA Uncles Replied to Us
    To the Editor:
    During the New Year this year, I used the money I usually saved to buy a picture and gave it to the PLA uncles on the southeast coast. Recently, I have received replies from the PLA uncles one after another. After reading these letters, my family and the surrounding children all liked them very much and read them several times a day. Every time we read the uncles' letters, it seems that the heroic image of the uncles is standing in front of us. In order to allow more children to see this letter, I am now copying a few paragraphs and sending them to you.
    PLA Uncle Shi Shude wrote in his letter: "We received the picture you sent us - 'We must liberate Taiwan'! On that meaningful and beautiful picture, you wrote down your hopes and instructions; these are not only your hopes and instructions, but the hopes and instructions of the 600 million people of China. We must firmly remember these words in our hearts and turn them into the power of our work and combat. We really don't know what actions or what feelings to use to thank you for your encouragement and care, which is indeed difficult to describe in words. Okay! Little brothers and sisters, let us stand on the frontier of the motherland and guarantee to you: We must study military affairs, politics, and culture hard, improve our combat skills, and be a soldier who is both civilized and martial; and we are determined to win glory for the motherland and make contributions to the people in the battle to liberate Taiwan!"
    PLA Uncle Zhang Zhixue wrote in his letter: "We posted the picture you sent from the capital of the motherland, Beijing, in our club as soon as we received it. The comrades who come to the club to participate in activities, after seeing this picture, have expressed their determination to strive to liberate Taiwan in accordance with the call of this picture. Little brothers, all the comrades in our unit want me to tell you that we must always be vigilant against the enemy's activities and defend the security of the motherland; if the enemy dares to invade, we will give him a resolute blow."
    The PLA uncles' letters have given us children great encouragement. Now that the winter vacation is coming to an end and a new semester is about to begin, we will use excellent academic performance to support the great struggle to liberate Taiwan.

    解放军叔叔给我们回信了编辑同志：
    今年过新年的时候，我拿平时节省下来的钱买了一幅画片，赠送给东南沿海的解放军叔叔们。近来连续收到了解放军叔叔们给我的回信。看了这些信以后，我们一家子和周围的小朋友们都很喜爱，一天要读好几次。我们每次读到叔叔们的来信时，好像叔叔的英雄形象站在我们面前。为了使更多的小朋友看到这封信，现在抄几段寄给你们。
    解放军史树德叔叔来信说：“你赠给我们的画片——一定要解放台湾，我们收到啦！在那张富有重大意义而又美丽的画片上，写下了你的希望和嘱咐；这不仅是你的希望和嘱咐，而是全中国六亿人民的希望和嘱咐，我们要把这些话牢牢记在心里，变成我们工作和战斗的力量。你们对我们的鼓舞和关怀，我们真不知拿什么行动、用什么心情来感谢你们，这确是用文字也难以形容出来的。好吧！小弟弟小妹妹们，让我们站在祖国的海防前线向你们保证：我们要努力学习军事、政治和文化，提高战斗本领，做个文武双全的战士；并决心在解放台湾的战斗中，为祖国争光，为人民立功！”
    解放军张志学叔叔来信说：“你从祖国的首都北京寄来的画片，我们在收到后马上就把它贴在我们的俱乐部里。来俱乐部活动的同志们，看到这幅画，都表示决心，要按照这幅画所号召的——一定要解放台湾而奋斗。小弟弟们，我们单位的全体同志要我转告你们，我们一定时刻警惕敌人的活动，保卫祖国的安全；要是敌人敢来侵犯，我们就狠狠地给他坚决的打击。”
    解放军叔叔的来信，给了我们小朋友很大的鼓舞，现在寒假快要结束了，新的学期又将开始，我们要用优良的学习成绩来支援解放台湾的伟大斗争。
