Dachen Is Accusing
Our reporter, Jin Feng

　　On the evening of February 13th—the first day of Dachen's liberation—we arrived on the silent and desolate Dachen Island.

　　The next morning, we arrived at Ao Li, Dachen. This was a street built along the harbor, once the busiest urban area of Dachen.

　　More than a thousand years ago, Dachen's abundant fishing grounds attracted the first group of the most courageous fishermen to cross the sea and fish here.

　　For more than a thousand years, fishermen who crossed the sea have been casting their nets and fishing here for generations. They split the rocks, reclaimed the wasteland, and built layers and rows of houses along the mountainside. Green brick roofs, green stone walls, and wooden buildings stretched from the mountains to the sea.

　　The port had berthed hundreds of fishing boats and merchant ships. Five or six thousand people once lived in this town.

　　What a scene is presented to us now!

　　A large field of rubble, with embers still burning; dozens of broken fishing boats lying upside down on the shore; pieces of fish-scale-covered planks scattered on the ground; looted stone walls standing silently like skeletons against the mountain.

　　As if a plague had swept through here, we walked into a silent street, only the hollow echo of our shoes walking on the bluestone slabs.

　　This used to be a place with grocery stores, oil and salt shops, silk and cloth shops, fresh fish shops, stationery stores, pharmacies, barbershops, and small restaurants... a place where five or six thousand people gathered and lived. Just a few days ago, fishermen carrying small baskets of fish and shrimp, and farmers carrying loads of green vegetables, exchanged them here for some oil and salt.

　　But now, it is as if an invisible iron broom has suddenly swept away this life.

　　However, life stubbornly leaves its traces.

　　Here, in the blackened stones and rubble, there are still dozens of half-burned urns and jars. Hundreds of bowls are neatly stacked together, the straw ropes that tied them have been burned to ashes. This is the site of the pottery shop that supplied every fisherman and farmer with pots and jars.

　　At the entrance of the second house, a stove stands dilapidatedly. This is the small restaurant that provided passing businessmen with a simple meal.

　　It is drizzling. The gray, dark sky seems to press down like a block of lead. My heart is heavier than a block of lead.

　　A small blacksmith shop, almost intact, stands miraculously on this dilapidated and desolate street.

　　A small house with a blacksmith's furnace standing at the door, the blacksmith's hammer lying on the ground. A tool table in front of the window, with pliers and tongs on it, and scrap iron piled underneath. The walls on both sides are full of hoes, sickles, axes, vegetable knives, and iron locks. This shop is not young, the dust on the beams has long turned black, and many iron tools are rusty. Two lines of chalk writing on the door panel caught our attention:
      “I am Chinese...”
      “We are all Chi…”

　　What does this mean? Why was it not finished? Was he unable to finish writing it, or unable to express his meaning?

　　The blacksmith's furnace is silent, and the owner who could not clearly express his meaning has been taken to a place where he can express himself even less.

　　On the door panel of a merchant's house, it is carefully written: "We're just going out for a bit, we'll be right back."

　　It seems that no deep disaster can suppress the will of the people to live. The people believe that the disaster brought to them by the Chiang bandit army will pass like a plague, and they firmly believe that they will inevitably return.

　　We came to a fishing village. The fishing village was also like it had been washed by a great flood. Apart from the burned houses, there were only some empty shells left.

　　We came to the largest fishing village—Nantian.

　　On an earthen field, three bundles of fishing nets were scattered. A glass spherical mooring light emerged from the black fishing net. The names "Dai Hengfeng" and "Dai Yili" were painted in red on the bamboo water bucket. A pair of small red shoes and children's diapers were still drying on the short stone wall. Half a pot of rice was left in the pot, half a bowl of fish and a bowl of pickled vegetables on the table, and half a rice flour ball gnawed by a child was still held up by bamboo chopsticks. Were they abducted while eating? Walking up the creaking stairs, upstairs were two plank beds and a large wooden bed with peeling red paint that had turned black. The bed also had two ancient lines of poetry written on it: "Excellent are they together, let their home be in order." Now, where are the owner of the ancient bed and his family?

　　On another small earthen field, a tattered fishing net full of holes was still spread out to dry on the stones, a raincoat leaned against it, with the words written below:
  “Fisherman Lin Miaofa.” Lin Miaofa’s bamboo hat and rain shoes were also placed beside it. It was as if he had just returned from the sea, took off his raincoat outside the door, and was watering fertilizer in his vegetable garden in front of his door. Three ridges of garlic and five ridges of green vegetables grew lushly. The fertilizer in the manure bucket was not finished, and it was poured on the ground. There was still half a spoon of manure in the fertilizer spoon. Two bowls of rice were placed on the wooden table in his dilapidated house, with half a bowl of jellyfish. It was as if his wife was waiting for him to eat. But the disaster of abduction suddenly came upon his head.

　　In almost every house that still existed, there was rice or sweet potatoes in the pot, unwashed bowls scattered on the stove, some dough was just mixed, a bite was taken out of a sweet potato, and the clothes being washed were still soaking in the water... When the disaster came, they didn't even have time to finish their last meal before they were forced to leave with bayonets.

　　In a square about thirty meters wide and one hundred meters long, it was as if someone had dumped a pile of garbage from an airplane, everywhere were rotten military uniforms, empty cans, broken sacks, rice, helmets, hats, rubber shoes, ration boxes, women's combs, broken huqins, leftover food, and rotten meat... The fleeing Chiang bandit army seemed to be very embarrassed. Five or six hundred boxes of American shells and bullets were piled on the dock, along with a large box stamped with the words "Top Secret" American military textbooks.

　　More than 10,000 residents of Dachen were dragged from here to American warships. How were they dragged away? On the left side of the square, we found a new pile of soil. The square is a flat earthen field, and this new pile of soil is particularly eye-catching. On both sides of the new soil are a dozen or so dug pits, covered with reed mats. The new soil was obviously dug from these pits.

　　We walked along the new soil, and after walking more than ten meters, we found the leg of a wet fisherman's black trousers, half buried in the mud. We dug it up with a stick. Ah, a pool of blood! Digging further down was a black top, also stained with blood!

　　The new soil originally covered blood stains! Starting from the middle of the left side of the square, all the way to the trench, the trench all the way to the sea.

　　The secret of this new soil, this square, is not difficult to discover.

　　According to foreign news agencies, the U.S. Marines were specially sent from Japan to Dachen to "assist in the evacuation." They came here to direct the atrocities!

　　The machine guns of the Marines were once set up around this square, and the bayonets of the Chiang bandit army forced the residents onto American warships. The people were unwilling to leave, the machine guns swept through, the bayonets were stained with blood, the blood was spilled on the square, and the corpses were buried along the trench all the way to the ocean. The perpetrators hurriedly dug up new soil to cover the bloodstains! These inhuman American and Chiang armies who forcibly abducted all the residents of the island with force wanted to kill and cover up the evidence!

　　But they couldn't cover up the traces after all. On the afternoon of February 14th, on our way to Huangfu Reef, we saw white smoke rising from Xia Yu, a small island opposite Dachen. The next morning, two residents rowed a bamboo raft to Dachen.

　　That afternoon, the People's Liberation Army's wooden boat transported the other thirty-nine residents together. They were so-called "suspects" who were exiled to that small island by the Chiang bandit army before they fled. Among them were fishermen, merchants, shop assistants, students, housewives, former POWs who were liberated by our army, a sixty-three-year-old man, and a two-year-old toddler. They accused the American and Chiang armies of abducting more than 10,000 residents of Dachen and creating a "no-man's land." The day after the liberation of Yijiangshan, the Chiang bandit army in Dachen panicked. Those packing up their bedding and carrying small bags were running around the streets.

　　On the morning of January 20th, the pseudo-"Wenling County Government" notified each Bao and each Lin (Jia) resident: male and female residents aged 18 to 35 could not leave temporarily and had to serve in the civil defense team to guard Dachen. Men and women over 36 had to register at the "Police Station."

　　Two days later, another notice came: regardless of men, women, old or young, everyone had to leave and register.

　　The "instructors" of each Bao gathered residents every day to hold meetings and "instruct" them, deceiving and threatening them:
      "If you don't leave, the Communists will kill you all when they come!"
      "Taiwan is a treasure island, rice is harvested three times a year. When you go to Taiwan, President Chiang will provide you with three months of meals, give you work to do, and give you books to read!"
      "There is no problem with the evacuation. American warships will come to pick you up, so don't worry."

　　The people were silent, they were calculating: they have lived here for generations, reclaimed barren mountains, built houses, and cast their nets and fish here year after year. What would they eat when they went to Taiwan? They also didn't believe the ghost story that "the Communists will kill all the people." They didn't say a word, they didn't want to go to the "treasure island."

　　"What, you don't appreciate it?" The "instructor's" face changed.
      "Are you willing to stay and give the Communists information? You have ideological problems!"
      With a "wah" sound, the children cried, and the women followed suit.
      "Don't cry, go back and think carefully, and come to register tomorrow."

　　In Ao Li, the seventy-three-year-old solitary old man who looked after the Yangfu Temple muttered tremblingly:
      "I am so old, I have no sons and no daughters, what can I do in Taiwan? After I die, no one will bring my bones back."
      "What, old man, you're not going?" The "instructor's" eyes widened, and the old man was arrested and detained for two days.

　　The eighty-two-year-old mother of fisherman Ma Xianchan in Huangfu Reef was determined not to go.
      "I will die at home, I am not afraid of being locked up!" The old woman said firmly.
      "We don't want you to die, we want your grandson to die for you, you old thing!"
  The "instructor" grinned.

　　Mother Ma had three sons, but only two grandsons. She was frightened and shed tears.

　　Even so, some people were quietly planning not to leave.

　　Fisherman Wang Xuejian of Huangfu Reef had lived in Dachen for six generations. He had been to Haimen to sell fish in 1949 and 1950 and had seen the People's Liberation Army.
      "The People's Liberation Army won't kill people, I've seen the People's Liberation Army, they treat the people very kindly, unlike these evil spirits!" The old fisherman quietly told his three sons, three daughters-in-law, and eight grandchildren. Their family of sixteen was planning not to leave.

　　The "instructor" of Huangfu Reef came over and asked him: "Wang Xuejian, are you going to Taiwan?"
      "I don't have money, no fields, no land, what can I eat in Taiwan?"
      "Even people with squinting eyes and crooked mouths who can't move in bed have to go. This is Commander Liu's order, you want to not go!" The "instructor" raised his voice, and the old man didn't dare to say more.

　　On New Year's Eve, the police came and asked his son to carry his small fishing boat to Langtongmen, where the fishing boats of Huangfu Reef were concentrated.

　　The Chiang bandit army supervised them, telling the fishermen to carry the boats to the mountains one by one.

　　The road to escape was cut off.

　　On February 3rd, the "evacuation rules" were issued. The neighborhood chiefs notified each household:
      "When you leave, you can't cry, you can't frown, you have to smile and shout 'Long live President Chiang!'"
      "Each person is only allowed to bring personal luggage and clothes. Fishing nets are not allowed, contraband is not allowed..."

　　Wang Xuejian sighed: "Going to Taiwan is a dead end!"

　　That night, he was arrested by a policeman and taken to the Kuomintang Secret Bureau's air-raid shelter. Here, he met Wang Xianghua, a woman with a two-year-old daughter, Chen Zhengyi, the owner of the soy sauce shop, Su Binglin, a clerk at Yun Da Trading Company, Zheng Kaimei, a tailor, Wang Yicai, a middle school student... They all did not want to go to Taiwan.

　　On February 5th, they were sent to Xia Yu. On the 7th, they saw American warships sailing to the Dachen sea. They knew that their relatives, their sons, daughters, mothers, and fathers, were being escorted to that American warship to be taken to Taiwan. Across the sea, they looked at Dachen and cried loudly.

　　On the 9th, 10th, and 11th, they saw the fire of Dachen.
      "It's all burning, it's all burning!" They beat their chests.
      "What kind of beasts, what kind of animals are these!" The old fisherman Wang Xuejian cursed angrily.

　　At this time, white sails rose on the sea. About forty fishing boats sailing from the mainland had arrived on the Dachen sea to fish. (Attached picture)

　　Residents imprisoned by the Chiang bandit army on Xia Yu Island accused the American and Chiang bandits of their crimes to our staff after being rescued by our army.

　　Before the Chiang bandit army fled, they carried out crazy destruction on the islands of Dachen, etc., and the houses and property of the residents were burned and looted. This is a corner of the Dachen Island pier.

    大陈在控诉本报记者　金凤
    二月十三日——大陈解放的第一天晚上，我们来到死寂的、荒凉的大陈岛上。
    第二天清晨，我们到了大陈的岙里。这是一条沿着港口建起的街道，曾经是大陈最热闹的市区。
    一千多年以前，大陈丰盛的产鱼区，就吸引了第一批最勇敢的渔民，过海到这里来打鱼。
    一千多年以来，过海的渔民世世代代在这里撒网，打鱼。他们劈开岩石，开出荒地，沿着山腰，盖起一层层、一排排的房屋。青砖盖的屋顶，青石块砌的墙壁，木板做的楼房，从山上一直蜿蜒到海边。
    港口，停泊过几百条渔船和商船。曾经有五、六千人在这街镇上生活着。
    现在，出现在我们面前的是怎样的一副景象啊！
    一大片瓦砾场，余烬还在燃烧着；几十条残破的渔船，船底朝天，躺在岸上；沾满鱼鳞的船板，一片片散落在地上；一座座抢劫一空的石头墙壁，沉默地像骨头架子似地靠山兀立着。
    仿佛瘟疫扫过这里，我们走进了一条没有声音的街道，只有我们几个人的皮鞋走在青石板上，发出空洞的回响。
    这里曾经是杂货铺、油盐店、绸布店、鲜鱼行、文具店和药房、理发店和小饭馆……五、六千人聚居、生活过的地方。几天以前，带着一小篓鱼虾的渔民，挑着一挑青菜的农民，曾在这里换回一些油和盐。
    而现在，仿佛有一把看不见的铁扫帚，把这生活突然扫走了。
    但是，生活顽强地留下自己的痕迹。
    这里，烧黑了的石头和瓦砾堆中，还有几十个烧成半截的瓮罐。上百个碗整齐地叠在一起，扎碗的草绳已烧成了灰。这是供给每一家渔民和农民盆盆罐罐的陶器店的遗址。
    在第二家的进门处，残立着一个炉灶。这是给那过路的生意人吃一顿便饭的小饭铺。
    天上在下着濛濛的细雨。灰色的阴暗的天空，仿佛铅块似地直压下来。我的心比压着铅块还沉重。
    一间几乎完整的小铁匠铺，奇迹似地兀立在这条破烂的荒凉的街上。
    一间小小的房子，当门立着一座铁匠炉，打铁的榔头躺在地下。窗前一张工具桌，上面放着老虎钳、铁钳、下面堆着废铁。两边壁上挂满了锄头、镰刀、斧头、切菜刀、铁锁。这铺子年龄已经不小了，梁上的尘埃早已发黑，许多铁器也都生了锈。门板上两行粉笔字又引起了我们的注意：
      “我是中国……”
      “我们都是中……”
    这是什么意思？为什么没有写完？他是来不及写完还是不能写完他的意思呢？
    铁匠炉沉默着，不能够明白地表白自己意思的主人已经被劫走到一个更不能表达自己意思的地方去了。
    在一家商人的门板上也小心地写着：“我们家里出去，马上就回来。”
    看来，任何深重的灾难压不住人民生活的意志。人民相信蒋贼军带给他们的这一场灾难会像瘟疫似地过去，他们深信自己是必然要回来的。
    我们来到一个渔村。渔村也像大水冲洗过的一样。除了烧掉的房子，就只剩一些空壳了。
    我们来到最大的渔村——南田。
    在一个土场上，散放着三捆渔网。一个玻璃的球形抛锚灯，从黑色渔网中露了出来。在竹制的水筒上有红漆漆的“戴恒丰”、“戴益利”的名字。石头垒的短围墙上还晒着一双小红鞋和孩子的尿布，锅里留着半锅饭，桌上半碗鱼，一碗咸菜，孩子啃下的半个米粉团还用竹筷顶着。他们是在吃饭时被劫走的吗？走上吱吱发响的楼梯，楼上是两张板床和一张红漆已经剥落，颜色变黑了的大木床。上面还写着两句古老的诗句：“式相好矣，宜其室家”。现在，古老的床的主人和他的家庭又在那里呢？
    在另一个小土场上，一张到处是洞的破鱼网还张开晒在石头上，一领蓑衣靠在旁边，下面写着：
  “渔民林妙法”。林妙法的笠帽和雨鞋也放在旁边。仿佛他刚从海上归来，在门外脱下蓑衣，正在门前他的菜园里浇粪。菜园里三畦大蒜，五畦青菜，都长得碧油油地。粪桶的粪没有浇完，倒在地上。粪勺里还有半勺粪。他的破屋里板桌上放着两碗饭，盛着半碗海蜇。仿佛他的妻子正在等他吃饭。而劫走的灾难突然来到他的头上。
    差不多每家还存在的房屋的锅里都有着饭或地瓜，没有洗的碗散放灶上，有的生面团刚刚和起，地瓜咬了一口，正在洗的衣服还浸在水里……灾难来到，他们甚至都来不及吃完最后一顿饭，就被刺刀逼着走了。
    在一个大约三十公尺宽、一百公尺长的广场上，仿佛有谁从飞机上倒下一地的垃圾，到处是烂军衣、空罐头、破麻袋、大米、钢盔、帽子、胶鞋、干粮箱、女人用的梳子，破胡琴、吃剩的饭、臭肉……逃跑的蒋贼军看来是十分狼狈。五、六百箱美国炮弹和子弹堆在码头上，旁边还有一大箱盖有“绝密”字样的美国军事教材。
    大陈一万多居民都是从这里被拖到美国军舰上去的。他们是怎样被拖走的呢？在广场的左方，我们发现了一溜新土。广场是平整的土场，这一溜新土显得特别惹眼。新土两旁是十几个挖起的土坑，上面用芦席盖着。新土显然是从这些土坑里掘起来的。
    我们沿着新土走去，走过十几公尺，就发现一只湿漉漉的渔民穿的黑裤裤脚，半截埋在泥里。我们用棒把它掘起。啊，一滩血迹！再掘下去是一件黑上衣，也染满了鲜血！
    新土原来掩盖着血迹！从广场左侧中间开始，一直到交通沟，交通沟一直到大海。
    这新土，这广场上的秘密是不难发现的。
    据外国通讯社报道：美国海军陆战队特地从日本开到大陈来“协助撤退”。他们是到这里来指挥行凶的！
    海军陆战队的机枪曾经架在这广场的周围，蒋贼军的刺刀逼着居民走上美国军舰。老百姓不愿意走，机枪扫射了，刺刀沾满血迹，鲜血洒在广场上，尸体沿着交通沟一直埋到海洋。行凶的暴徒匆匆掘起了新土，掩盖着血迹！这些灭绝人性、用武力劫走全岛居民的美蒋军队，就是这样地想杀人灭迹的！
    但是他们到底灭不了迹。二月十四日的下午，我们在走向黄夫礁的路上，远远地看到大陈对面的一个小岛——下屿冒出白烟。第二天早晨，两个居民划着竹排到大陈。
    当天下午，解放军的木船把其他三十九个居民一起运过来。他们是被蒋贼军在临逃跑以前流放到那小岛上的所谓“嫌疑分子”。他们之中，有渔民、有商人、有店员、有学生、有家庭妇女，有被我军解放回去的战俘；有六十三岁的老人，也有两岁的幼儿。他们控诉了美蒋军队劫夺大陈居民一万多人、制造“无人区”的罪行。一江山解放的第二天、大陈的蒋贼军就慌起来了。打铺盖的、背小包袱的、满街乱窜。
    一月二十日早晨、伪“温岭县政府”就通知各保、各邻（甲）居民：十八岁到三十五岁的男女居民暂时不能走、要担任民防队，守卫大陈。三十六岁以上男女都到“警察局”去登记。
    两天以后，通知又来了：不管男女老少，一概要走，统统要去登记。
    各保的“指导员”天天召集居民开会“训话”，欺骗着和恫吓着：
      “你们不走，共产党来了要把你们都杀光！”
      “台湾是宝岛，大米一年收三次，你们到台湾去，蒋总统管你们三个月饭，给你们有工做，有书念！”
      “撤退没有问题，有美国大兵舰来接你们，你们放心好了。”
    老百姓沉默着，他们划算着：世世辈辈住在这里，开起荒山，造起房屋，年年在这里撒网、打鱼，到台湾去吃什么？他们也不相信“共产党要杀光老百姓”的鬼话。他们不吭声，他们不愿到“宝岛”去。
    “怎么，你们不识抬举？”“指导员”的脸色变了。
      “你们愿意留下来给共产党通消息？你们思想有问题！”
      “哇”的一声，小孩哭起来了，妇女们也跟着哭。
      “不许哭，回去好好想想，明天都来登记。”
    岙里，“阳府庙”看庙的七十三岁的孤老头子，颤巍巍地咕哝着：
    “我年纪这一把了，没有儿，没有女的，到台湾去干什么？死了以后，这一把骨头也没有人给我搬回来。”
    “怎么，老头子，你不去？”“指导员”的眼睛瞪了起来，老头子被抓去，关了两天。
    黄夫礁渔民马仙产的八十二岁的老母亲是决意不去的了。
    “我死也死在家里，关起我也不怕！”老婆婆说得很坚决。
    “倒不要你死，要你的孙子替你这老东西死！”
  “指导员”狞笑着。
    马老婆婆三个儿子，只有两个孙子。她被吓着了，流下泪来。
    尽管如此，还是有人悄悄地打算着不走。
    黄夫礁的渔民王学鉴，在大陈住了六代了。他在一九四九、一九五零年到过海门卖鱼，见过解放军。
      “解放军来，勿会杀人的，我见过解放军，待老百姓真和气，那像这些煞神！”老渔民悄悄地和他的三个儿子、三个儿媳、八个孙儿女讲着。他们一家十六口是打谱不走的了。
    黄夫礁的“指导员”走了过来问他：“王学鉴，台湾去不去？”
    “我没有钞票，没有田，没有地，去台湾吃什么？”
    “歪眼别嘴，躺在床上走不动的人都要去。这是刘司令的命令，你们想不去！”“指导员”的嗓门提高了，老头子再不敢多说。
    阴历大年夜，警察走来叫他儿子把他家小渔船撑到琅通门，黄夫礁的渔船都集中在那里。
    蒋贼军在一旁监督着，叫渔民们一个个把船抬到山上。
    逃跑的路截断了。
    二月三日，“疏散规则”发下来了。邻长挨户通知着：
    “走的时候，哭不行，眉头皱不行，要笑嘻嘻的喊‘蒋总统万岁！’”
    “每人只准带随身行李衣服。渔网不许带，违禁品不许带……”
    王学鉴叹了一口气：“到台湾去死路一条！”
    当天晚上，他被一个警察捉了去，带到特务机关保密局的防空洞。在这里，他遇到了带着两岁女儿的妇女王香花，酱油店的老板陈正谊，运大商行的伙计苏炳林，做裁缝的郑楷梅，中学生王义才……他们都是不愿意到台湾去的。
    二月五日，他们被送到了下屿。七日，他们看到美国兵舰开到大陈海面。他们知道他们的亲人，他们的儿子、女儿、母亲、父亲，正被押到那美国兵舰上，开到台湾去。他们隔着大海，望着大陈，放声痛哭着。
    九日，十日，十一日，他们看到了大陈的火光。
    “都烧起来了，烧起来了！”他们捶着自己的胸。
    “这是一批什么样的野兽，什么样的畜生啊！”老渔民王学鉴愤愤地痛骂着。
    这时候，海面扬起白帆。大陆上开出来的四十条左右的渔船已经来到大陈海面捕鱼了。（附图片）
    被蒋贼军囚禁在下屿岛上的居民经我军救出后纷纷向我工作人员控诉美蒋匪徒的罪行。
