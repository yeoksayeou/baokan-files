    China's railway transport capacity is constantly growing. By the end of 1954, the turnaround time of trains had been shortened to 3.04 days, which, compared with the previous year, is equivalent to saving 480,000 carriages for the whole year. These carriages can be used to load about 5 million tons of goods. The average weight pulled by each freight train increased by 66.3 tons compared with the previous year, saving the country about 100 billion yuan in funds for the whole year.

    The railway technical equipment left over from old China was very backward: small in quantity, poor in quality, low in efficiency, and complex in standards. However, relying on the active efforts of all railway workers to tap the potential of existing equipment, it has gloriously shouldered 85 percent of the country's freight transport tasks in recent years, and has overfulfilled the state plan year after year. Last year, there were new changes in the transportation situation. More than half of the annual plan was completed in the first half of the year, thus avoiding the passive situation of overly concentrated and tense transportation tasks in the fourth quarter that has occurred in previous years. Major materials such as coal, coke, steel, mineral building materials, and timber have been transported according to plan and on a quarterly balanced basis.

    The railway's leadership at all levels has taken measures to strengthen transportation organization, which is the main guarantee for improving transportation capacity. For example, actively implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, increasing direct transportation and group loading, and accelerating vehicle turnover have played a significant role in overcoming the contradiction that transportation capacity cannot meet transportation needs. Last year, more than 30,000 direct freight trains were operated, accounting for 15.7 percent of the total number of vehicles loaded nationwide; group loading accounted for 29.8 percent. Operating direct trains means that vehicles are no longer picked up or dropped off mid-way, which can reduce the burden on marshalling stations and shorten train travel time. It takes 20 days for ordinary trains to transport steel from Anshan Iron and Steel Company to Wuhan, but direct trains arrive in eight days. Shanghai East Station has organized many "department store direct trains" to rapidly supply the needs of many medium and small cities and rural areas across the country for daily necessities. The thirteen major marshalling stations across the country have generally improved their technical operations, thus strengthening the line capacity in these hub areas. In 1953, the Beijing Railway Administration often experienced vehicle congestion. In the most serious cases, the Fengtai and Xizhimen marshalling stations were full of vehicles, which greatly affected the transportation of the entire area. At the end of August, with the help of Soviet experts, all employees of the Administration conscientiously implemented the operation plan, overcame difficulties, and changed the long-term chaotic situation. Now this area is basically operating normally, and traffic is smooth. In recent years, the socialist cooperation between the railways and state-owned brother enterprises has been strengthened, and the balanced loading situation has improved, which has relatively improved transportation capacity.

    The "full load, over-axle, 500-kilometer movement" mobilizes the vast number of employees to tap potential and improve transportation efficiency. "Full load" means fully utilizing the vehicle's carrying capacity and volume to load more goods; "over-axle" and "500 kilometers" means requiring trains to pull more and run faster. The main gains of this movement last year were: the number of over-axle trains (that is, the weight pulled by the train exceeds the national specified indicators) continued to increase, and about 20 million tons of goods were pulled more throughout the year; the number of under-axle trains was significantly reduced, and the number of under-axle tons decreased by about 70 percent compared with the previous year. The best performing unit was the Harbin Railway Administration, which accounted for one-half of the total over-axle tonnage of the entire railway. By December of last year, only two out of every thousand trains were under-axle trains. They are striving to eliminate under-axle trains. Five years ago, the old hero Li Yong drove the first over-axle train. Now "over-axle drivers" have become a huge force, and 80 percent of the freight drivers on the entire railway can drive over-axle trains. Some of them often complete the annual transportation tasks ahead of schedule, some continue to operate over-axle trains in severe cold weather of minus 40 degrees Celsius, and some have created experience in pulling over-axle trains on difficult sections of high slopes. The nationally renowned "Mao Zedong" heroic locomotive has safely traveled more than 640,000 kilometers. In the "full load" work, the vast number of employees improved cargo packaging, improved loading technology, and created more loading methods that exceeded the old technical standards. Thousands of advanced workers of "skillful loading and more loading" have emerged. Advanced methods such as cross-loading of timber and double-layer loading of pigs have been promoted nationwide. Last year, after the five major cotton transportation administrations in Zhengzhou, Jinan, Taiyuan, Beijing, and Tianjin completed the cotton packaging and re-pressing work, an average of three to four tons more cotton could be loaded on each vehicle. The waste phenomenon of large vehicles replacing small vehicles, large vehicles loading light goods, and low-side vehicles loading coal is also decreasing in loading work. Last year, the average load per vehicle increased by 1.3 tons compared with the previous year, which means that an average of 6,500 tons of goods can be loaded more per day and night.

    In order to meet the growing needs of the country's transportation tasks, the existing railways have begun technical renovations. In the past two years, more than 400 kilometers of double tracks have been built, the equipment of several major stations has been strengthened, and a number of meeting stations have been newly built and repaired in busy transportation areas. These key projects have also played an important role in strengthening traffic capacity. For example, after the Beijing-Shenyang line, which is 850 kilometers long, was fully opened to double tracks last year, the train throughput capacity of this most important trunk line in the country has been greatly enhanced. It will better shoulder the task of material exchange between inside and outside the pass; this railway is connected to important seaports such as Tanggu, Qinhuangdao, and Huludao, so it will also better shoulder the task of transporting China's export goods to the above-mentioned ports and transporting imported materials to the inland areas.

    我国铁路运输能力不断增长
    我国铁路的运输能力正在不断增长。到一九五四年止，列车周转时间已缩短为三·○四天，和前年相比，等于全年节省了四十八万辆车，拿这些车辆，可以多装约五百万吨货物；每一列货物列车平均所拉的重量比前年提高了六十六·三吨，全年可为国家节省约一千亿元资金。
    旧中国遗留下来的铁路技术设备非常落后：数量少、质量差、效率低、标准复杂。但是，依靠全路职工积极挖掘现有设备的潜在能力，几年来它光荣地担负起了百分之八十五的全国货物运输任务，年年超额完成国家计划。去年运输情况更有了新的变化，上半年就完成了全年计划的一半以上，因而避免了历年来第四季度运输任务过于集中紧张的被动局面。煤、焦、钢铁、矿物性建筑材料、木材等主要物资已经作到了按计划、按季度均衡运输。
    铁路各级领导部门采取措施加强了运输组织工作，是提高运输能力的主要保证。例如，积极贯彻苏联专家建议，增加了直达运输和成组装车，加速了车辆周转，对克服运输能力不能满足运输需要的矛盾，起了很大的作用。去年共开行了三万多列直达货物列车，占全国总装车数的百分之十五·七；成组装车占二十九·八。开行直达列车就是中途不再甩挂车辆，这样可以减轻编组站的负担，缩短列车旅行时间。鞍山钢铁公司的钢材运到武汉，普通列车要运二十天，直达列车八天就到了。上海东站曾组织多次“百货直达列车”，迅速地供应了全国许多中、小城市和农村对于日用品的需要。全国十三个主要编组站普遍改进了技术作业，因而加强了这些枢纽地区的线路通过能力。北京管理局在一九五三年常常发生车辆堵塞的现象，最严重的时候，丰台和西直门两个编组站上车辆满线，使全区运输受到很大影响。八月末，在苏联专家帮助下，管理局全体职工认真执行作业计划，克服困难，改变了长期混乱的情况，现在这个地区已基本上正常运转，往来车辆畅行无阻。近年来铁路和国营兄弟企业的社会主义合作加强了，平衡装车情况改善，也相对地提高了运输能力。
    “满载、超轴、五百公里运动”动员着广大职工来挖掘潜力，提高运输效率。“满载”就是充分利用车辆的载重力和容积，多装货物；“超轴”“五百公里”就是要求列车拉得多，跑得快。这个运动去年的主要收获是：超轴列车（就是列车牵引的重量超过国家规定指标的重量）继续增加，全年多拉了约二千万吨货物；欠轴列车显著减少，欠轴吨数比前年减少了约百分之七十。成绩最优良的是哈尔滨管理局，超轴的吨数占全路的二分之一，到去年十二月，每一千列车只有二列是欠轴列车。他们正在争取消灭欠轴。五年以前，老英雄李永驾驶了第一列超轴列车，现在“超轴司机”已成为一支庞大的队伍，全路货运司机已有百分之八十能驾驶超轴列车。他们有的经常提前完成全年运输任务，有的在零下四十度的严寒气候下照常超轴，有的创造了在高坡道的困难地段牵引超轴列车的经验。全国闻名的“毛泽东号”英雄机车已经安全行走了六十四万多公里。在“满载”工作中，广大职工改进货物包装，改进装载技术，创造了更多的超过旧技术标准的装载方法。出现了成千上百名“巧装多载”的先进工作者。木材对装、双层装猪等先进方法已在全国推行。去年郑州、济南、太原、北京、天津等五个主要运棉管理局全部完成了棉花包装改榨工作后，平均每辆车可以多装三吨到四吨棉花。装载工作中大型车代替小型车、大型车装轻货、低边车装煤的浪费现象也在减少。去年，每辆车的平均装载量比前年又提高了一·三吨，这就是说，每昼夜平均可多装六千五百吨货物。
    为了适应国家运输任务日益增长的需要，现有铁路已着手进行技术改造。两年来修筑了复线四百多公里、加强了几个主要站场的设备，在运输繁忙的地区新设及修复了若干会让站。这些重点工程对于加强行车能力也已发生了重要作用。例如，全长八百五十公里的北京—沈阳线在去年全线双轨通车以后，这条全国最主要干线的列车通过能力大大增强了。它将更好地担负起关内外物资交流的任务；这条铁路联系着塘沽、秦皇岛、葫芦岛等重要海港，因此它也将更好地担负起将我国出口货物运送到上述港口，将进口物资运送到内地的任务。
