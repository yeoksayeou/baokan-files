    New Atmosphere in the New Countryside
    Through the education of socialist schools—agricultural producers' cooperatives—many farmers' collectivist thinking and new moral qualities are growing. The Qinghai Daily, in its "New Atmosphere in the New Countryside" column on February 2nd, published several short communications introducing this new atmosphere.
    One communication, titled "Han Ha-san and His Son Han Qi-long," tells people that Han Ha-san's family separated because of discord between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and they deliberately built a wall in the middle of the small courtyard to sever contact. However, after Han Ha-san and his son Han Qi-long participated in the agricultural producers' cooperative and gradually realized the importance of harmony and unity in production, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law reconciled and reopened the wall in the middle of the small courtyard. People in the village saw this and said, "The cooperative has brought you two back together!"
    Another article writes about how the farmer Han Chang-mao changed his attitude towards his wife. In the past, Han Chang-mao not only disliked labor but also often beat and scolded his wife. But when he joined the agricultural producers' cooperative, especially after seeing his wife, Mai Suo-ya, become a production team leader because of her good work and receive people's respect, he completely changed his past wrong attitude. He not only worked actively but also consciously obeyed the leadership of team leader Mai Suo-ya.
    There is also a communication writing about how Zhao Yuan-qing, a member of the agricultural producers' cooperative, subordinated his personal interests to the collective interests of the cooperative.
    Discord between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, and husbands beating and scolding wives, are all bad habits left over from feudal society. These bad habits were deeply rooted in many farmers and not easy to change. But when they participate in agricultural producers' cooperatives and undergo collectivist education, especially through the practice of collective labor, new social consciousness, new family concepts, and new labor attitudes replace their old habits. And our newspapers have a responsibility to reveal these new things in people's lives and consciousness. This is not only because these new things may not be noticed by every reader, but also, as the Qinghai Daily pointed out in its editor's note: "This collectivist thinking, which is generated on the basis of common labor, in turn, greatly promotes the socialist transformation of agriculture." It is very necessary for the Qinghai Daily to call on correspondents to pay attention to reporting these new things.

    新农村新气象
    经过社会主义学校——农业生产合作社的教育，许多农民的集体主义思想和新的道德品质正在生长。青海日报在二月二日的“新农村新气象”专栏中，就集中刊登了几篇介绍这种新气象的小通讯。
    一篇题为“韩哈三和他儿子韩起龙”的通讯告诉人们，韩哈三家因为婆婆和媳妇不和而分了家，并且特地在小院的正中打起了一道墙，以断绝来往。但是在韩哈三和他儿子韩起龙参加农业生产合作社，逐渐认识到和睦团结搞好生产的重要性后，婆婆和媳妇和好起来，把小院正中的墙又打开了。村里人见了都说：“合作社又把你们婆媳俩合到一块啦！”
    另一篇写的是农民韩长毛改变了对待妻子的态度。过去，韩长毛不但不爱劳动，而且时常打骂妻子。可是当他参加农业生产合作社，特别是看到他妻子麦索牙因为劳动得好而当了生产队长，受到人们的尊敬后，就完全改变了过去的错误态度，他不但积极劳动，而且自觉地服从队长麦索牙的领导。
    还有一篇通讯是写农业生产合作社社员赵元庆怎样以个人利益服从了社的集体利益。
    婆婆和媳妇不和，丈夫打骂妻子，这都是封建社会遗留下来的恶习。这种恶习在许多农民身上本是根深蒂固不容易改掉的。但是当他们参加农业生产合作社，经过集体主义的教育，特别是经过集体劳动的实践，新的社会意识，新的家庭观念，新的劳动态度，就代替了他们的旧习惯。而我们报纸就有责任把人们生活中意识中的这种新的东西，揭示出来。这不仅仅因为这些新的东西不是每个读者都能注意到，而且正如青海日报在编者按语中所指出的：“这种在共同劳动的基础上所产生的集体主义思想，反过来对于农业的社会主义改造又有很大的促进作用。”青海日报号召通讯员注意报道这些新的东西是非常必要的。
