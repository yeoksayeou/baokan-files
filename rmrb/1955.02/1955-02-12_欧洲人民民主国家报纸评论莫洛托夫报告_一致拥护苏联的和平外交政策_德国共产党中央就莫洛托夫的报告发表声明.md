Xinhua News Agency, February 11th Dispatch: According to TASS, the newspapers of the European People's Democratic countries attach great importance to the report on the international situation and the foreign policy of the Soviet government made by Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov at the Supreme Soviet meeting on February 8th.

All major newspapers in Poland, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Albania published Molotov's report prominently with large headlines and widely published commentaries expressing support for the Soviet Union's foreign policy.

An editorial in the Czechoslovak "Red Right News" said that Molotov's report is of great significance, and it sharply analyzed the current international situation. The people of all countries have once again heard the voice of the Soviet government, which clearly, directly, and openly discussed the urgent issues of concern to all honest people today. Peace-loving people can once again be confident that the Soviet Union is determined to do everything possible to strengthen and develop peaceful relations between countries for the peaceful coexistence of all countries. The Soviet Union is determined to resolutely oppose all perfidious plans of the enemies of peace who threaten mankind with a new war. The Czechoslovak people firmly stand on the same front as the Soviet Union and persistently and unswervingly fight against the forces of war.

The Hungarian "Free People's Daily" said: Molotov's report gives the masses of working people an accurate understanding of the world political situation, making them more confident that the forces of peace are invincible. At the same time, this report has raised their vigilance and strengthened their determination to fight in the future, because the various adventurous plans of the imperialists have been ruthlessly exposed before them. Based on Molotov's report, millions of people are even more grateful to the Soviet Union, have a deeper love and trust for the Soviet Union, and have strengthened their confidence: the cause of peace is in reliable hands.

An editorial in the Albanian "People's Voice" wrote: Molotov's report profoundly and objectively analyzed the international situation of the past decade. All activities of the Soviet government in foreign policy are aimed at peacefully resolving international disputes, defending peace, and easing international tensions. The Soviet Union has always strived to ensure the security of countries with different social systems, and a prominent example of this is the Soviet government's proposal to establish a European collective security system. The Soviet government's recent proposal on the German question also proves this point.

An editorial in the Romanian "Spark Daily" said, "The Soviet Union's foreign policy is loved and supported by the people of the world, and this is the source of its strength." The people of all countries warmly watch the Soviet Union, rejoice in its achievements, and realize that these achievements will ensure the victory of world peace. People's democratic countries, including our country, fully support the Soviet Union's struggle for peace, and closely cooperate with the Soviet Union to unswervingly implement the policy of easing international tensions."

The Bulgarian "People's Army News" and "People's Youth News" published editorials on Molotov's report. "People's Army News" wrote that Molotov's report put forward the Soviet government's authoritative assessment of current major international issues and exposed the supporters of the aggressive policies of the imperialist countries. The two newspapers also emphasized that the Bulgarian people warmly welcome Molotov's report. They wholeheartedly support the principles of peaceful coexistence.

The German Democratic Republic's "New Germany News," "New Times," and "National Daily," among others, published editorials and articles commenting on Molotov's report. In an editorial, "New Germany News" commented on the part of Molotov's report concerning the German question, pointing out the dangers of ratifying the Paris Accords to Germany. The editorial also pointed out that Molotov's stated purpose of Soviet foreign policy, and the proposals he put forward aimed at easing international tensions, are in line with the wishes and interests of the people of all countries, and therefore they will receive strong support from the people of all countries.

Xinhua News Agency, February 11th Dispatch: According to TASS, Berlin, February 10th: According to the German News Agency, the Central Committee of the German Communist Party issued a statement on Molotov's report on the international situation and the foreign policy of the Soviet government.

The statement said: Molotov's report at the Supreme Soviet meeting is of great significance. This report shows that the purpose of the Soviet policy has always been to maintain peace and to peacefully coexist among countries with different social systems. Molotov said that the Soviet government considers the solution of the German question to be very important. The Soviet government's statement on the German question on January 15 was intended to explain the possibility of peacefully restoring German unity. It is possible to hold free all-German elections in 1955, which is of decisive significance for the residents of West Germany. But the prerequisite for holding this election is to reject the Paris Accords. The statement said that Adenauer intends to suppress the resistance of the residents of West Germany by all means, so as to force the Federal Parliament to pass the Paris Accords from February 24 to 26. This is equivalent to splitting our motherland for a long time. That is why we should do our best to prevent the ratification of the Paris Accords for the sake of our country.

The statement said: We have the strength to do this. The working class and the broad popular movement striving to restore German unity under conditions of peace and freedom have recently clearly expressed their will in the form of popular votes, mass rallies, demonstrations, and strike protests.

The statement concluded that the German people should accept the hand of negotiation extended by the Soviet Union once again. The statement called on all those who oppose the Paris Accords to unite and act together.

    欧洲人民民主国家报纸评论莫洛托夫报告
    一致拥护苏联的和平外交政策
　　德国共产党中央就莫洛托夫的报告发表声明
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社报道：欧洲人民民主国家的报纸十分重视苏联外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫二月八日在苏联最高苏维埃会议上所作的关于国际局势和苏联政府外交政策的报告。
    波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、保加利亚和阿尔巴尼亚的所有的主要报纸都在显著地位以大字标题发表了莫洛托夫的报告，并且广泛发表了评论，表示拥护苏联的外交政策。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”的社论说，莫洛托夫的报告具有很大的意义，它鲜明地分析了当前的国际局势。各国人民又一次听到了苏联政府的呼声，它明确、直接和公开地谈到了现在一切正直的人们所关心的迫切问题。爱好和平的人民又一次可以相信，苏联为了各国的和平共处，决定全力争取加强和发展各国之间的和平关系。苏联决心坚决反对用新战争威胁人类的和平敌人的一切背信弃义的计划。捷克斯洛伐克人民坚决同苏联站在一条阵线上，顽强地坚持不渝地为反对战争势力而斗争。
    匈牙利的“自由人民报”说：莫洛托夫的报告使劳动人民群众对世界政治局势有了确切的认识，使他们更加相信和平力量是不可战胜的。这一报告同时提高了他们的警惕性，加强了他们今后斗争的决心，因为在他们的面前，帝国主义者的种种冒险计划已被无情地揭露了。千百万人民根据莫洛托夫的报告更加感谢苏联，对苏联有了更深刻的爱戴和信任，并加强了自己的信心：和平事业掌握在可靠的手里。
    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”的社论写道：莫洛托夫的报告深刻地、客观地分析了近十年来的国际局势。苏联政府在外交政策方面的全部活动都是为了和平解决国际争端、保卫和平和缓和国际紧张局势。苏联一向为保障各种不同社会制度的国家的安全而努力，其中一个突出的例子是苏联政府关于建立欧洲集体安全体系的建议。苏联政府最近就德国问题提出的建议也证明了这一点。
    罗马尼亚“火花报”的社论说“苏联的外交政策得到世界人民的爱戴和支持，这就是它的力量的泉源。“世界各国人民热情地注视着苏联，为它的成就而感到欢欣，并且认识到这种成就将保障世界和平获得胜利。包括我国在内的人民民主国家，全力支持苏联争取和平的斗争，并且和苏联密切合作，始终不渝地执行缓和国际紧张局势的政策。”
      保加利亚的“人民军报”和“人民青年报”就莫洛托夫的报告发表了社论。“人民军报”写道，莫洛托夫的报告提出了苏联政府对目前重大国际问题的权威估计，并且揭穿了帝国主义国家外交政策的侵略方针的支持者。这两个报纸还着重指出，保加利亚人民热烈欢迎莫洛托夫的报告。他们衷心拥护和平共处的各项原则。
      德意志民主共和国的“新德意志报”、“新时报”和“国民日报”等都发表了社论和文章，评论莫洛托夫的报告。“新德意志报”在社论中评论了莫洛托夫的报告中关于德国问题的部分，指出了批准巴黎协定对德国的危险。社论还指出，莫洛托夫所说的苏联外交政策的目的，以及他所提出的旨在缓和国际紧张局势的建议，是符合各国人民的愿望和利益的，因此，它们将得到各国人民的有力支持。
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社柏林十日讯：据德意志通讯社消息，德国共产党中央委员会就莫洛托夫关于国际局势和苏联政府的外交政策的报告发表声明。
    声明说：莫洛托夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上的报告有十分重大的意义。这一报告表明，苏联的政策目的一贯都是为了维持和平和为了各种不同社会制度的国家和平共处。莫洛托夫说，苏联政府认为解决德国问题是十分重要的。苏联政府一月十五日就德国问题发表的声明的本意就是要说明和平恢复德国统一的可能性。在一九五五年就有可能举行全德自由选举，这对西德居民来说是有决定性的意义的。但是举行这一选举的前提是拒绝巴黎协定。声明说，阿登纳打算用一切办法来压制西德居民的反抗，以便在二月二十四日到二十六日硬使联邦议院通过巴黎协定。这等于要长期分裂我们祖国。这就是为什么我们应当为我们国家考虑而竭力防止批准巴黎协定。
    声明说：我们是有力量来这样做的。工人阶级和争取在和平、自由的条件下恢复德国统一的广大人民运动最近以人民投票、群众集会、示威游行、罢工抗议等形式明确地表达了自己的意志。
    声明最后说，德国人民应该接受苏联再一次伸出的协商的手。声明要求一切反对巴黎协定的人联合起来，共同行动。
