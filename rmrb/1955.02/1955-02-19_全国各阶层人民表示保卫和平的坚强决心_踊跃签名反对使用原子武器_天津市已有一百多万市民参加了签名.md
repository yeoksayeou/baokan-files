We must sign against the use of atomic weapons!"

    More than 1,200 representatives and labor models from all walks of life, including fishermen, salt farmers, and peasants from the Zhoushan Islands, held a meeting in Dinghai County on the morning of the 16th to sign against the use of atomic weapons. At the meeting, the representatives expressed that they must resolutely oppose the use of atomic weapons with practical actions of striving to increase production and fully supporting the struggle to liberate Taiwan, achieving "providing manpower when needed, providing ships when needed, and providing grain when needed." On the afternoon of the same day, more than 7,000 people from all walks of life in Dinghai County held a demonstration.

    Workers' families, revolutionary soldiers' families, and housewives in Nanjing actively participated in the signature campaign. Sixty-year-old Zhang Yunzhu said when signing: I have already sent two sons to join the People's Liberation Army to defend our country; today, I am signing to express my determination to defend our country. Xu Zhie, a model member of a Chinese People's Volunteer Army family, said after signing: I will write a letter to my son in Korea and tell him to contribute his strength to the cause of defending peace.
