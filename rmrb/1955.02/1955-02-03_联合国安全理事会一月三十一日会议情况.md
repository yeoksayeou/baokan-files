(Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd dispatch from New York) The United Nations Security Council met on January 31st at the United Nations Headquarters.

    The Soviet delegation submitted the question of the United States' aggressive acts against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan and other island regions of China to the Security Council for discussion, and put forward a draft resolution on this question. This draft resolution recommends that the Security Council condemn the United States' aggressive acts against the People's Republic of China; recommends that the United States government immediately take steps to terminate the aforementioned aggressive acts and its interference in China's internal affairs, and withdraw all U.S. land, sea, and air forces from Taiwan Island and all other territories belonging to China; and calls upon all parties to prevent military actions in the Taiwan region in order to facilitate the withdrawal of all armed forces not belonging to the People's Republic of China from the islands in that region.
    The New Zealand delegation, with the support of the United States and British representatives, submitted the question of the situation in the Taiwan Strait to the Security Council for discussion.
    After the President of the Security Council, Mr. Munro, announced the opening of the meeting, the Soviet representative, Mr. Sobolev, immediately stated that the Soviet delegation does not recognize the credentials of the representatives of the Kuomintang clique and requested the Security Council to expel the Kuomintang representative and not allow him to participate in the Security Council's discussion of the important issues to be considered. Mr. Sobolev pointed out that only the representative of the People's Republic of China can represent China.
    The United States representative, Mr. Lodge, proposed that the Security Council not discuss any proposals regarding the exclusion of the Kuomintang representative or the admission of the representative of the People's Republic of China. Mr. Lodge also requested the Security Council to discuss his proposal first.
    The British representative, Mr. Dixon, supported Mr. Lodge's proposal, while expressing the hope of inviting the representative of the People's Republic of China to participate in the Security Council's discussion of the issues to be considered.
    In response to the British representative's comments, Mr. Sobolev reminded everyone of the importance of the issues to be discussed, and therefore the Security Council must resolve the long-standing issue of Chinese representation.
    The Security Council adopted the United States' proposal by a vote of ten to one.
    Subsequently, the Security Council entered into a discussion on the preliminary agenda. The President of the Security Council, Mr. Munro, said that as soon as the preliminary agenda was adopted, he would immediately recommend that the Security Council invite the representative of the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of the situation in the Taiwan Strait.
    The Soviet representative, Mr. Sobolev, spoke to explain the reasons for the Soviet government's proposal to include the question of the United States' aggressive acts against the People's Republic of China on the Security Council's agenda. (Full text to be published separately, see page 1 of this newspaper, February 2nd)
    The morning meeting adjourned at this point.
    In the afternoon meeting, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and some other countries put the question raised by New Zealand forward, attempting to circumvent the discussion of the question of the United States' aggressive acts against the People's Republic of China through procedural tricks.
    The United States representative, Mr. Lodge, spoke in support of New Zealand's proposal. He avoided discussing the issue of the U.S. aggressive acts that caused the threat, attempting to shift the blame for the dangerous situation onto the People's Republic of China and attempting to divert attention from the U.S. aggressive actions in the Far East. He insisted that the People's Republic of China's liberation of Yijiangshan Island from the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang was a "seizure," and he called the People's Republic of China's actions "aggression." This U.S. representative attempted to reduce the entire issue to a ceasefire on the coastal islands. He attempted to portray the U.S. President's message and Congress's authorization for the U.S. President to intervene militarily in China's internal affairs as "defensive" measures. This U.S. representative said that he was not opposed to including the issue raised by the Soviet Union on the agenda.
    The British representative, Mr. Dixon, appeared as a supporter of the U.S. aggressive policy in the Far East. He insisted that the United States hoped for peace in Asia. He said that his delegation believed that both New Zealand's proposal and the Soviet Union's proposal should be included on the Security Council's meeting agenda. However, he said that New Zealand's proposal should be discussed first, and the issue raised by the Soviet Union should be considered after the Security Council had finished discussing New Zealand's proposal and made a decision. The representatives of Brazil, Belgium, Peru, Turkey, Iran, and France, as well as the Chiang Kai-shek elements, favored discussing the issue raised by the New Zealand delegation first.
    The Soviet representative, Mr. Sobolev, spoke. He said that the U.S. representative had acknowledged in his speech that a threat to peace in the Far East existed. We heard the U.S. representative say here that this threat could be eliminated as long as a ceasefire was implemented on the coastal islands of China. However, this U.S. representative did not explain how a ceasefire and a cessation of hostilities could be achieved without eliminating the root cause of the hostilities. These root causes are the U.S. aggressive acts against Chinese territory and the de facto occupation of China's Taiwan and Penghu Islands.
    Mr. Lodge carefully avoided this issue in his speech and did not mention it at all.
    Mr. Sobolev continued by saying that Mr. Lodge probably would not deny that the U.S. armed forces were supporting the Chiang Kai-shek group and this group's provocative actions against the People's Republic of China. This support is becoming wider every day and is causing concern that the threat of war in the region will increase. The U.S. representative also cannot deny that the U.S. has long been openly discussing plans to deploy its large armed forces in a war against the People's Republic of China. If this is the case, then it is obvious that merely stopping hostilities on the coastal islands cannot achieve the desired result—the result that the U.S. representative talked about here, which is to eliminate the threat and eliminate the tense situation in the Far East.
    Mr. Sobolev said that to eliminate the threat of war, the root cause of this threat must be eliminated. And this root cause, as we have already pointed out, is the U.S. interference in China's internal affairs, the presence of U.S. armed forces on Chinese territory, and the U.S. aggressive acts against the People's Republic of China.
    Mr. Sobolev said that the draft resolution submitted by the Soviet Union to the Security Council indicates the Soviet delegation's attitude regarding inviting the representative of the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of the issues facing the Security Council. The Soviet delegation recommends inviting the representative of the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of the question of the United States' aggressive acts against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan and other island regions of China. It is a more correct approach to resolve the order of discussion of the issues on the agenda after the Security Council has adopted the agenda. We firmly advocate that the Security Council should discuss the question of the United States' aggressive acts against the People's Republic of China, and oppose New Zealand's proposal. Because this proposal does not mention the essence of the root cause of the escalating tension in the Far East, nor does it mention the essence of the root cause of the threat of war.
    The British representative, Mr. Dixon, then formally suggested that the Security Council should first decide by vote whether to include the issue raised by New Zealand on the agenda, and whether to include the issue raised by the Soviet Union on the agenda. Subsequently, the Security Council should decide whether to discuss the issue raised by New Zealand to completion before starting to discuss the issue raised by the Soviet Union.
    The Soviet representative, Mr. Sobolev, requested that the majority of the Security Council's member states abide by the recognized rules of procedure regarding the adoption of the agenda. He proposed an amendment to the British suggestion, stipulating that the issue raised by the Soviet delegation should be discussed first. However, this amendment was rejected.
    The majority of the Security Council favored including the issue raised by New Zealand on the agenda. The Soviet representative voted against it. The Security Council then included the issue raised by the Soviet delegation on the agenda. Only the Chiang Kai-shek elements voted against it.
    The Security Council then began discussing the first item on the agenda that had been adopted, which was the issue raised by New Zealand regarding the hostilities in certain island regions off the coast of mainland China.
    The New Zealand representative suggested that the Security Council invite the representative of the government of the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of the issue raised by New Zealand, and suggested that the Security Council request the Secretary-General of the United Nations to issue this invitation to the government of the People's Republic of China. The representatives of France and the United States supported this suggestion. The United States representative explained that his support for this suggestion does not affect the U.S. position on the issue of Chinese representation in the United Nations, nor does it affect its attitude of not recognizing the government of the People's Republic of China.
    Because the New Zealand suggestion only mentioned inviting the representative of the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of the issue of "cessation of hostilities" raised by New Zealand, and did not mention the formal suggestion raised by the Soviet Union to invite the representative of the government of the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of the question of the United States of America's aggressive acts against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan and other island regions of China, therefore the Soviet representative put forward a suggestion aimed at ensuring a more thorough study of New Zealand's suggestion. However, due to the insistence of the President of the Security Council, the New Zealand suggestion was put to a vote and was adopted by the Security Council. The Soviet delegation abstained from the vote. Mr. Sobolev, in explaining the Soviet delegation's voting attitude, said that it abstained because the issue raised by the New Zealand delegation does not conform to the true purpose of easing tensions and reducing the threat of a new war in the Far East. Mr. Sobolev said that the Soviet delegation has suggested including the question of the United States' aggressive acts against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan and other island regions of China on the Security Council's agenda, and firmly advocates that the Security Council should decide to invite the representative of the People's Republic of China to participate in the discussion of the Soviet Union's suggestion on the aforementioned issue. The Belgian representative suggested temporarily suspending the discussion in order to issue an invitation to the People's Republic of China and await its reply. This suggestion was adopted. The Security Council's afternoon meeting adjourned at this point.

    联合国安全理事会一月三十一日会议情况
   【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国安全理事会一月三十一日在联合国总部开会。
    苏联代表团把关于美国在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为问题提交安全理事会讨论，并且提出一项关于这个问题的决议草案。这个决议草案建议安全理事会谴责美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为；建议美国政府立即采取步骤，以终止上述侵略行为和它对中国内政的干涉，从台湾岛和属于中国的其他一切领土撤退美国的一切陆、海、空军部队；吁请任何一方防止在台湾地区的军事行动以便于不属于中华人民共和国的一切武装部队从那个地区的岛屿撤退。
    新西兰代表团在美国和英国代表的支持下，把关于台湾海峡局势问题提交安全理事会讨论。
    在安全理事会主席孟罗宣布开会以后，苏联代表索波列夫立即发言说，苏联代表团不承认国民党集团代表的代表权，并要求安全理事会驱逐国民党代表，不许他参加安全理事会关于将要审理的重要问题的讨论。索波列夫指出，只有中华人民共和国代表才能代表中国。
    美国代表洛奇提出一项提案，规定安全理事会不讨论关于排斥国民党代表或接纳中华人民共和国代表的任何建议。洛奇并要求安全理事会首先讨论他的提案。
    英国代表狄克逊支持洛奇的提议，而同时表示希望邀请中华人民共和国的代表参加安全理事会关于将要审理的问题的讨论。
    索波列夫在回答英国代表的意见时，提醒大家注意将要讨论的问题的重要性，因此安全理事会必须解决拖延已久的中国代表权问题。
    安全理事会以十票对一票通过了美国的提案。
    接着，安全理事会进入关于初步议程问题的讨论。安全理事会主席孟罗说，一等到初步议程通过后，他就立即要建议安全理事会邀请中华人民共和国代表参加关于台湾海峡局势问题的讨论。
    苏联代表索波列夫发言，解释了苏联政府建议把关于美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为的问题列入安全理事会议程的理由。（全文另发，见二月二日本报第一版）
    上午会议至此结束。
    在下午会议上，美国、英国和其他一些国家的代表把新西兰提出的问题摆在前面，企图在程序上玩弄花样，借此来规避讨论美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为的问题。
    美国代表洛奇发言支持新西兰的建议。他避而不谈造成威胁的美国侵略行为的问题，企图把引起危险局势的罪过推诿到中华人民共和国身上，并且企图转移人们对美国在远东的侵略行动的注意。他硬说中华人民共和国从蒋介石匪帮手中解放一江山岛是“夺取”，他把中华人民共和国的行动叫做“侵略”。这个美国代表企图把整个问题缩小到在沿海岛屿停火。他企图把美国总统的咨文和国会授权美国总统武装干涉中国内政的决议说成是“防御性”的措施。这个美国代表说，他并不反对把苏联提出的问题列入议程。
    英国代表狄克逊以美国在远东的侵略政策的拥护者的姿态出现。他硬说美国希望亚洲和平。他说，他的代表团认为，新西兰的建议和苏联的建议都应当列入安全理事会会议议程。但是他说，应当首先讨论新西兰的建议，苏联提出的问题应当在安全理事会结束了关于新西兰的建议的讨论并且作出决定以后再来审议。巴西、比利时、秘鲁、土耳其、伊朗和法国代表以及蒋介石分子赞成首先讨论新西兰代表团提出的问题。
    苏联代表索波列夫发言。他说，美国代表在发言时曾经承认对远东和平的威胁是存在的。我们听到美国代表在这里说，只要在中国沿海岛屿上实行停火，就能消除这种威胁。但是，这位美国代表并没有说明，不消除产生敌对行动的根源，怎么能够实现停火和停止敌对行动。这些根源就是美国对中国领土的侵略行为，并且实际上占领了中国的台湾和澎湖列岛。
    洛奇先生在发言时小心翼翼地避开了这个问题，对这个问题只字不谈。
    索波列夫接着说，洛奇先生大概不会否认，美国的武装部队在支持着蒋介石集团和这个集团对中华人民共和国的挑衅行动。这种支持一天比一天广泛，并且引起人们担心这个地区的战争威胁会增长。美国代表也无法否认，美国早已在公开讨论把美国庞大武装部队投入反对中华人民共和国的战争中去的计划了。如果事实是这样，那末很明显，仅仅停止沿海岛屿上的敌对行动不能获得所希望的结果——美国代表在这里谈到过的结果，那就是消除威胁，消除远东的紧张局势。
    索波列夫说，要消除战争的威胁，就必须消除引起这种威胁的根源。而这个根源，如我们所早已指出的，是美国干涉中国的内政，是美国的武装部队在中国的领土上出现，是美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为。
    索波列夫说，苏联向安全理事会提出的决议草案中表明了苏联代表团关于邀请中华人民共和国的代表参加讨论安全理事会面临的问题的态度。苏联代表团建议邀请中华人民共和国的代表参加讨论美国在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为的问题。在安全理事会通过了议程以后再解决议程上各项问题讨论的次序问题，是比较正确的办法。我们坚决主张安全理事会应当讨论美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为的问题，反对新西兰的建议。因为这个建议并没有提到加剧远东紧张关系的根源的实质，也没有提到造成战争威胁的根源的实质。
    英国代表狄克逊接着正式建议，安全理事会应当首先用投票方式决定是否把新西兰提出的问题列入议程，以及是否把苏联提出的问题列入议程，随后安全理事会再决定是否把新西兰提出的问题讨论完毕后再着手讨论苏联提出的问题。
    苏联代表索波列夫要求安全理事会大多数理事国遵守公认的关于通过议程的议事规则。他对英国建议提出修正，规定应当首先讨论苏联代表团提出的问题。但是，这个修正案被否决了。
    安全理事会大多数赞成把新西兰提出的问题列入议程。苏联代表投票反对。安全理事会接着把苏联代表团提出的问题列入议程。只有蒋介石分子投票反对。
    于是安全理事会开始讨论已经通过的议程上的第一个项目，也就是新西兰提出的关于在中国大陆沿海某些岛屿地区的敌对行动的问题。
    新西兰代表建议安全理事会邀请中华人民共和国政府代表参加关于新西兰提出的问题的讨论，并且建议安全理事会要求联合国秘书长向中华人民共和国政府发出这个邀请。法国和美国的代表支持这个建议。美国代表解释说，他支持这个建议并不影响美国对中国在联合国的代表权问题的立场，也不影响它不承认中华人民共和国政府的态度。
    由于新西兰的建议中只谈到邀请中华人民共和国的代表参加讨论新西兰提出的“停止敌对行动”的问题，而丝毫没有谈到苏联提出的邀请中华人民共和国政府的代表参加讨论关于美利坚合众国在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为的问题这一个正式建议，因此苏联代表提出了
  一个旨在保证对新西兰的建议进行较为透彻研究的建议。但是，由于安全理事会主席的坚持，新西兰的建议提付表决，并且经安全理事会通过。苏联代表团在表决时弃权。索波列夫在解释苏联代表团的投票态度时说，它之所以弃权，是因为新西兰代表团提出的问题并不符合缓和紧张局势和减少远东新战争威胁的真正目的。索波列夫说，苏联代表团已经建议把美国在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为的问题列入安全理事会议程，并且坚决主张，安全理事会应当决定邀请中华人民共和国的代表参加对苏联关于上述问题的建议的讨论。比利时代表建议暂时停止讨论，以便向中华人民共和国发出邀请，并且听候它的答复。这个建议被通过了。安全理事会下午会议至此休会。
