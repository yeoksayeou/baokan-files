    Disappointed Departure from Dezhou Station
    To the Editor:
      I took a train from Shanghai to Beijing and got off at Dezhou midway due to some business. After getting off the train, I was worried and at a loss at the station, carrying two heavy pieces of luggage, because I didn't know how to proceed with the procedures for continuing my journey. Just then, a "train newspaper vendor" came by, so I stopped him and asked for help.
    "Ask the train conductor, I don't take care of that," he said, and walked away.
    I carried my luggage to find the train conductor. After walking about one or two hundred meters, I saw a comrade wearing a stationmaster's armband, and I happily asked him.
      "Go find the train attendant. How can I manage all these specific things?" The stationmaster walked away without even looking at me.
    I had no choice but to pick up my luggage again and go to find the train attendant. When I asked the train attendant comrade what I should do to continue my journey, the reply I received was: "This isn't an information desk." He pointed to the station with his mouth and walked away without saying another word.
    I was very distressed and picked up my luggage to find the information desk. After much effort, I finally found a small hole in the window of the "information desk." A female comrade at the information desk was leisurely chatting with another comrade. But when I asked her to sign my ticket, she seemed unwilling to get involved, turned her face away, and said: "No, I don't know if there are any seats available on the train you want to take." I pleaded for a long time, but still no one would sign my ticket. What should I do? I didn't know, and no one bothered to tell me. So, I could only leave Dezhou Station in disappointment.　Gao Zijun

    失望地离开了德州车站编辑同志：
      我从上海乘火车到北京，因事中途在德州下车。下车后，因为不知道如何办理继续乘车的手续，我提着两件很重的行李，在车站犹豫发愁。正好，来了一位“列车售报员”，我就叫住了他，向他请教。
    “问列车长去吧，我管不着。”他说着就扬长而去。
    我提着行李去找列车长。走了约一、二百公尺，看见一位带着站长臂章的同志，就高兴地问他。
      “找列车员去，这些具体的事，我那里管得了这许多。”站长一眼也没有看我就走开了。
    我无可奈何，只好再提起行李去找列车员。当我向列车员同志提出要继续乘车应当怎么办的时候，得到的答复是：“我这里又不是问事处。”他用嘴向车站指了一下，没说第二句话就走开了。
    我十分苦恼地提起行李去找问事处，好不容易找到了“问事处”窗前的一个小洞洞口。问事处的一位女同志，安闲地正在和另一位同志聊天。但是当我请她在车票上签字时，她好像不愿过问，脸转过去说：“不行，我不知道你要乘的车有没有空。”我恳求了半天，仍然没人给我在车票上签字。究竟应该怎么办呢？我不知道，而谁也不屑告诉我。于是，我只能失望地离开了德州车站。　高子君
