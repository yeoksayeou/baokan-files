    Atomic Weapons Cannot Intimidate Us
    Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions

    In the past few days, the broad masses of workers across the country have participated in the signature campaign against atomic weapons with unparalleled indignation. The Chinese working class, engaged in intense labor, is resolutely opposed to war. We love peace, we do not want war, and this wish of the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country is consistent with the people of the world.

    We love peace because a peaceful environment is essential for our construction endeavors. However, the Chinese people, tempered by long revolutionary struggles, are also not afraid to wage wars of resistance against aggression, because our fruits of victory must not be taken away by aggressors, and our construction endeavors must not be destroyed by aggressors. To liberate ourselves, we have paid a noble price, fighting selflessly under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party for a long time. If we were neurasthenic people who could be frightened by war cries, the decades of revolutionary war in China would not have happened at all, or would not have persisted and achieved final victory. The past history of the Chinese people's struggle should be sufficient to prove this point: if the imperialist warmongers dare to launch a war, then they will certainly be resolutely countered, and they will certainly be annihilated in the war. Just as our great leader Chairman Mao Zedong pointed out at the reception held by the Soviet Ambassador to China on February 14: "As long as the imperialists launch a war of aggression, we and the people of the world will certainly wipe them off the face of the earth!" The broad masses of workers are participating in the signature campaign against atomic weapons with precisely this kind of sentiment.

    The discovery of atomic energy is a great achievement of human civilization. If this energy is used for peaceful production, it will create greater material happiness for mankind. But in the current world, there are two fundamentally opposite routes. One is to apply this new energy to peaceful undertakings, seeking great happiness for mankind. The establishment of the Soviet Union's first atomic energy power station; the recent announcement by the Soviet government that it will not only provide the people's democratic countries with scientific, technological, and industrial assistance to develop research on the peaceful uses of atomic energy, but also present a report at an international conference on the experience of the Soviet Union in building the first atomic energy power station, in order to spread the Soviet Union's scientific experience. This historically significant and great initiative is entirely in line with the aspirations of progressive humanity in the world. But people must not fail to notice that, contrary to the Soviet Union's route, there is also a route in the world of American imperialism using atomic energy to carry out aggressive war. Since the North Atlantic Treaty Organization held a meeting in Paris last December, American imperialism has disregarded the condemnation of human conscience and has moved from clamoring for atomic war to actively preparing for atomic war. This threat is not only directed at Europe, but recently, American warmongers have even more frantically clamored for the use of atomic weapons in the Asian region. This mad and inhumane atomic war clamor must be resolutely opposed. The people of the world can unite to oppose this sinister conspiracy, and they will certainly be able to smash this conspiracy. The tide of people opposing atomic war has already been set off all over the world, and this tide will drown the atomic war peddlers.

    We love peace, and we especially understand the preciousness of peace. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we went through a long revolutionary war against domestic and foreign enemies before we built our own country—the People's Republic of China. With a people's country, we can then create our own happy life through peaceful labor. In just a few years, we have gradually changed the face of cities and villages, and have already achieved great success in peaceful construction. It is only because of the protection of the United States that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which has long been spurned by the Chinese people, still occupies a corner of our territory—Taiwan, preventing the compatriots in Taiwan from being liberated. However, Taiwan is bound to be liberated. The American aggressors have occupied our territory of Taiwan and are using atomic intimidation to prevent us from liberating Taiwan. Of course, the Chinese people will never exchange their territory and sovereignty for so-called "peace." The Chinese people deeply understand that concession to the aggressor is encouragement to the aggressor. We love peace, we oppose war, and we oppose the use of atomic weapons even more. But we are not afraid of war, nor are we afraid of atomic weapons. We are prepared to resolutely resist the aggressors, and we will certainly liberate Taiwan.

    原子武器吓不倒我们
    中华全国总工会主席　赖若愚
    最近几天，全国职工群众以无比激愤的心情参加了反对原子武器的签名运动。处在紧张劳动中的中国工人阶级是坚决反对战争的。我们热爱和平，我们不要战争，中国工人阶级和全国人民的这种心愿和全世界人民是一致的。
    我们热爱和平，因为和平环境对于我们的建设事业是必需的。然而久经革命斗争锻炼的中国人民也决不害怕进行反抗侵略的战争，因为我们的胜利果实是不容侵略者夺去的，我们的建设事业是不容侵略者破坏的。为了解放自己，我们曾经付出了高贵的代价，奋不顾身地在中国共产党的领导下进行了长期的斗争。如果我们是神经衰弱的、可以被战争叫嚣吓倒的人，中国数十年革命战争就根本不会发生，或者不会坚持下去，取得最后胜利。中国人民以往的斗争历史，应该足以证明这一点，即：如果帝国主义好战分子敢于发动战争，那末他们将一定要遭到坚决的回击，他们将一定要在战争中被消灭。正如我们伟大领袖毛泽东主席二月十四日在苏联驻我国大使馆的招待会上指出的：“只要帝国主义发动侵略战争，我们和全世界人民就一定要将它们从地球上消灭干净！”全国职工群众正是以这种情绪来参加反对原子武器签名运动的。
    原子能的发现，是人类文明的伟大成就。如果把这种能量用于和平生产，将会为人类创造更大的物质幸福。可是在当前世界上却存在着两条根本相反的路线。一条是把这种新的能量运用到和平事业方面，为人类谋求巨大幸福。苏联第一个原子能电力站的建立；苏联政府最近宣布苏联不仅给予人民民主国家以科学技术和工业上的帮助，以发展原子能在和平用途方面的研究，而且将在国际会议上提出关于苏联建成第一个原子能电力站的经验的报告，以传播苏联在科学方面的经验。这种具有历史意义的伟大创举，是完全符合世界进步人类的愿望的。但是人们决不能不注意到和苏联的路线相反，世界上还存在着一条美帝国主义的把原子能用于进行侵略战争的路线。去年十二月北大西洋公约组织举行巴黎会议以后，美帝国主义已不顾人类良心的谴责，由叫嚣原子战争而进行到积极准备原子战争了。这种威胁不仅对着欧洲，最近美国好战分子更疯狂叫嚣要在亚洲地区使用原子武器。对于这种发了狂的灭绝人性的原子战争叫嚣，必须坚决反对。全世界人民能够团结起来反对这种罪恶阴谋，也一定能够把这种阴谋粉碎掉。人民反对原子战争的浪潮已经在全世界各地掀起来了，这个浪潮将会把原子战争贩子们淹死。
    我们热爱和平，我们特别懂得和平的可贵。我们在中国共产党领导下，经过长期的反对国内外敌人的革命战争才建成了我们自己的国家——中华人民共和国。有了人民的国家，我们才有可能用和平劳动缔造自己的幸福生活。在短短几年中，我们已经逐步改变了城市和乡村的面貌，已经在和平建设中取得了巨大的成就。只是由于美国的庇护，才使那早已被中国人民唾弃了的蒋贼集团还占据着我国领土的一角——台湾，使台湾同胞不得解放。然而台湾是必定要解放的。美国侵略者侵占了我国领土台湾，又以原子恐吓来阻止我们解放台湾。当然，中国人民决不会以自己的领土和主权来换取所谓“和平”。中国人民深切地了解，对于侵略者的退让，就是对于侵略者的鼓励。我们热爱和平，我们反对战争，我们更反对使用原子武器。但是我们不怕战争，也不怕原子武器，我们准备对侵略者进行坚决的反抗，我们一定要解放台湾。
