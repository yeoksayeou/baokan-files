Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Liu Shaoqi, and Premier of the State Council, Zhou Enlai, were all invited to attend the banquet.

Also attending the banquet were: Vice Chairmen of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Li Weihan, Chen Shutong, and committee members in Beijing, and Chairman of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, Liu Geping.

Also attending the banquet were: Vice Premiers of the State Council, Deng Xiaoping and Deng Zihui, Secretary-General, Xi Zhongxun, Vice Chairmen of the Nationalities Affairs Commission, Wang Feng, Liu Chun, Sa Kongliao, and Yang Jingren, ministers and vice ministers of various ministries, chairmen and vice chairmen of various commissions, the Central People's Government's representative in Tibet, Zhang Jingwu, and Deputy Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Fan Ming.

Also attending the banquet were: President of the Supreme People's Court, Dong Biwu, Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, Zhang Dingcheng, senior generals of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, standing committee members of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference in Beijing, Vice Mayors of Beijing, Zhang Youyu, Wu Han, and Wang Kunlun, Acting President of the Buddhist Association of China, Xirao Gyatso, as well as heads of other religious organizations and heads of the Central Institute for Nationalities.

Attending as guests were: Living Buddha Lincang, Living Buddha Jiayang, Sokang Wangqing Gele, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, and Ngawang Jinba.

Also attending as guests were: family members of the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdini, heads of the Tibetan visiting delegation, and secular and religious officials from the Tibetan local government in Beijing.

At the banquet, the Dalai Lama delivered a speech first. He said: Today is the Tibetan New Year. We are celebrating the New Year freely and happily in the capital of the motherland, Beijing. This is the first time in history and is worthy of special and warm celebration. Due to the victory of the great Chairman Mao's correct ethnic policies, the relationship between and within all nationalities has been fundamentally changed, allowing our minority nationalities to hold their heads high forever. We participated in the National People's Congress meeting, formulated and passed our country's constitution, and elected the leaders of the Chairman and state organs, actually enjoying the rights of national equality. All of this shows that the people of all ethnic groups in our country, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have established a new and friendly relationship of unity.

He also said that during our recent visits to East China, Northeast China, and other places, we saw the greatness and loveliness of the motherland, and we saw that the religious beliefs of all nationalities were respected and protected. All of this has given us great education and encouragement. We fully believe that under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and with the help of the advanced Han people, our minority nationalities, especially the relatively backward Tibetan nationality living on the southwestern border of the motherland, have an infinitely bright and happy future. In the future, we must exert all our strength to further strengthen the close unity with all fraternal nationalities, especially the Han people, as well as the internal unity of Tibet, to build the motherland, build a prosperous and happy new Tibet, resolutely oppose the aggression of American imperialism, liberate our motherland's territory of Taiwan, and defend the peaceful construction and security of the motherland, and defend peace in Asia and the world.

The Panchen Erdini then delivered a speech. He said: Today, we are able to gather together in the great capital of Beijing to celebrate the Tibetan New Year, which is a great honor. At the same time, we also deeply realize that this is only possible in the warm family of the motherland under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, which so respects the customs and habits of minority nationalities and is so caring. This is the glory of Chairman Mao's great ethnic policy. He said: We must resolutely, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, further consolidate the unity within Tibet and the great unity among all fraternal nationalities in the country, strengthen the anti-imperialist and patriotic forces of the Tibetan people, thoroughly implement the peaceful agreement, and strive to consolidate the southwestern national defense of the motherland and build a new Tibet.

He also said: During our visit to major cities in the motherland, we have personally witnessed that under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and governments at all levels, people of all ethnic groups throughout the motherland have truly become the masters of the country, and are united and full of confidence, working hard for a happier and more fulfilling life. In particular, the great cause of industrialization in the motherland is developing at a rapid pace on the basis of the great achievements already made. It makes us deeply realize that our motherland is truly strong, it has the strength to defend the security of its territory, it can give any enemy who dares to invade our territory a fatal blow, and it can achieve complete victory in the cause of liberating its territory of Taiwan, resolutely opposing atomic war, and defending peace.

Chairman Mao also delivered a speech at the banquet. He said: On the occasion of the Tibetan New Year, let us congratulate the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdini, congratulate all Tibetan personnel in Beijing, and congratulate all Tibetan people in Tibet and other regions! We should all work hard to further strengthen and consolidate the unity among all ethnic groups in our country, further strengthen and consolidate the unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities, as well as the internal unity of the Tibetan nationality, and jointly build our great motherland.

Finally, he said, let us:

To the health of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdini, to the health of all Tibetan monks and laypeople in Beijing, and to the great unity of all ethnic groups in our country, cheers!

The banquet proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere.

After the meeting, the Tibetan visiting delegation's song and dance troupe and the Central National Song and Dance Troupe jointly performed wonderful programs.

    他又说：我们这次在祖国各大城市参观的过程中，亲眼看到了，祖国各地各族人民在伟大的中国共产党和各级人民政府的领导下，人民真正作了国家的主人，并团结一致，信心百倍地为着自己更幸福美满的生活，而辛勤地劳动着，特别是祖国工业化的伟大事业，在已获得的巨大成就基础上，正以飞跃的速度向前发展中。它使我们深刻地认识到我们的祖国真正是强大的，它有力量保卫自己领土的安全，它能够给予敢于侵犯我国领土的任何敌人以致命的打击，它能够在解放自己的领土台湾、坚决反对原子战争、保卫和平的事业中，获得完全的胜利。
