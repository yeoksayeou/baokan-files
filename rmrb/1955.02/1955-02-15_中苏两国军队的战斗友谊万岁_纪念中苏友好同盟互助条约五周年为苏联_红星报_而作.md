Long Live the Combat Friendship Between the Chinese and Soviet Armies
    —Written for the Soviet "Red Star" Newspaper in Commemoration of the Fifth Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance
    Luo Ronghuan, Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance has been signed for five years. The facts of the past five years have repeatedly proven that the signing of this treaty has heavily struck at the U.S. imperialist policy of aggression and at the U.S. imperialist plot to revive Japanese militarism; it has played an extremely great role in guaranteeing our country's security and socialist construction, and in safeguarding Asian and world peace. On this occasion of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, the Chinese people and their armed forces—the Chinese People's Liberation Army—feel boundless joy and sincerely thank the Soviet Union for its selfless assistance and full support to our country.

    Under the banner of Marxist-Leninist internationalism, the great Soviet Union has consistently shown great sympathy for the Chinese people's struggle to break free from the shackles of imperialism and feudalism and to strive for national and social liberation. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet Union immediately signed the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance with our country and provided comprehensive and selfless assistance to our country. Now, our country has smoothly passed the period of economic recovery and entered a period of planned economic construction. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our people are taking the Soviet Union as an example, marching forward along the road of national socialist industrialization, and striving to build our country into a great socialist nation. The Chinese people deeply know that every major achievement in the victory of the Chinese revolution and socialist construction is inseparable from the Soviet Union's sympathy, support, and assistance. Our people will never forget this great fraternal friendship of the Soviet Union and will always regard the Soviet Union as their most loyal friend. The Chinese people are proud to have such a loyal friend as the Soviet Union and are full of infinite confidence in the future. At the same time, we believe that the Chinese people's efforts to enhance their economic and defense capabilities will also further consolidate the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and contribute to the struggle of all progressive mankind against aggression, to safeguard world peace, and to strive for a bright future. The great Lenin pointed out long ago that it is necessary to combine the socialist revolution of the Western proletariat with the liberation movement of the oppressed nations of the East to deal with the common enemy. We have realized Lenin's instruction. The friendship and unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples are a model of this combination. The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance has enabled the armies of our two countries to jointly undertake great historical tasks, thereby deepening and developing the combat friendship between our two armies.

    The armies of China and the Soviet Union are both armies of working people led by the Communist Party, guided by Marxism-Leninism, and fighting for common goals. This consistency in political thought and struggle goals constitutes the foundation of the unity and friendship between our two armies. History has linked our destinies together. Our unity and friendship cannot be broken by anyone, and our strength cannot be destroyed by anyone.

    It is known to the world that the Soviet armed forces are a powerful force defending the Soviet people's glorious communist construction and a cornerstone for safeguarding world peace and the just cause of mankind. In the Great Patriotic War, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and with the support of the Soviet people, the Soviet armed forces, with self-sacrificing spirit and heroic and extraordinary struggle, defended the independence and freedom of the Soviet motherland, eliminated the Hitler bandit gang that attempted to dominate the world, rescued the enslaved people of Europe, and liberated many countries in Central and Southeast Europe from the chains of imperialist exploitation; and in the East, they participated in the war against Japanese imperialism, eliminating the main force of the Japanese imperialist Kwantung Army, thereby assisting the Chinese people in defeating Japanese imperialism. The Soviet armed forces' victory in the Great Patriotic War, which has world historical significance, created extremely favorable conditions for the Chinese revolution to win nationwide victory.

    The strength and invincibility of the Soviet armed forces lie not only in its modern, technically equipped with the highest scientific achievements; but, more importantly, it lies in the guidance of Marxist-Leninist military science and the lofty ideals and great patriotism and internationalism of each of its officers and soldiers. The Soviet armed forces were, are, and will continue to be a model for the Chinese People's Liberation Army to learn from.

    From the day it was founded, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has emphasized learning from the Soviet army. Learning from the Soviet army is a glorious tradition of our army. The Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong creatively developed Stalin's idea that armed struggle is of particular importance to the Chinese revolution, and specifically applied the military doctrines of Marxism-Leninism and the experience of Soviet army building to the practice of the Chinese revolutionary war and the building of the revolutionary army, created the people's revolutionary army, established the absolute leadership of the Party over the army, established political work in the army, and formulated a complete set of strategies and tactics suitable for the needs of the Chinese revolutionary war. It was precisely by relying on this revolutionary army that the Chinese people, through long-term arduous struggle, overthrew the bloody rule of imperialism and its running dogs in China and won the nationwide victory of the Chinese revolution.

    The Chinese People's Liberation Army is now shouldering the great historical task of defending the achievements of the people's revolution and the socialist construction of the motherland, liberating Taiwan, the territory of the motherland, eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, defending against imperialist aggression, and safeguarding Asian and world peace. In order to accomplish this task, our army is working hard to learn from the Soviet Union's advanced military science and the experience of the Soviet army's construction, and striving to build itself into an excellent modern revolutionary army. Over the past five years, our army has gradually established various special forces units, as well as the air force and navy, on the basis of the original infantry. The technical equipment of our army has been greatly improved. Various formal systems are being universally implemented throughout the army. In accordance with the Soviet army's principle of training troops according to actual combat requirements, the troops are stepping up training in the combined operations of the army, navy, and air force. Our army has also strengthened political and ideological education, and the Marxist-Leninist ideological level of officers and soldiers has been significantly improved. In addition, our army has also established various regular military schools, providing a source of officer replenishment for the modernization of our army. As a result of these efforts, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has taken a big step forward in the historical transition from the lower stage to the higher stage.

    Learning from the Soviet army has accelerated the process of our army's modernization and improved our army's combat effectiveness, thereby further enhancing the confidence of the Chinese and Soviet armies in completing their common historical tasks.

    As everyone knows, the Chinese people, like the Soviet people, love peace. Both of our governments pursue a peaceful foreign policy. We are willing to coexist peacefully with any country with different social and political systems. We have no intention of invading other countries, nor will we allow other countries to invade us. After the Korean armistice and the restoration of peace in Indochina, the tense situation in Asia and internationally has gradually eased. However, U.S. imperialism is not reconciled to the failure of its policy of aggression and war. On the contrary, in order to continue to create international tensions and attempt to provoke a new world war, it has coerced its vassal states in the Far East to sign the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty," which is hostile to China and the people of Asia, supports the forces of Japanese militarism, continues to occupy our country's territory of Taiwan, and intensifies the use of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to carry out piratical harassment against our country's coast. Recently, it has even more shamelessly signed the so-called U.S.-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty"; at the same time, in the West, it is forcing Britain, France, and other countries to accelerate the ratification of the "Paris Agreement," actively arming West Germany, and frantically stepping up preparations for an atomic war. This policy of aggression and war by U.S. imperialism is a serious threat to the security of China, the Soviet Union, and the people's democracies, and to peace in Asia and the world. The people and armed forces of China and the Soviet Union are not amateurs when it comes to opposing aggressors, and no intimidation or blackmail will ever frighten us. Our cause of opposing aggression and safeguarding peace has the sympathy and support of all progressive mankind. We must and will be able to crush the policy of aggression and war of U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army must liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair, and no one is allowed to interfere. The U.S. military must withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. The Chinese People's Liberation Army will never give up until Taiwan is liberated. The Chinese People's Liberation Army has the confidence and the strength to accomplish this task.

    Our country's rock-solid fraternal alliance with the great Soviet Union, our country's close unity with the people's democracies in the great family of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the rising struggle of progressive mankind throughout the world to strive for peace and oppose aggression are the guarantees that our people and their armed forces can accomplish their great historical tasks. The armies of China and the Soviet Union have established a deep combat friendship. Now we must further develop this friendship and consolidate this friendship. Because the friendship between the people and armed forces of our two countries not only affects China and the Soviet Union themselves, but also affects the future of all mankind.

    Long live the unbreakable combat friendship forged by the armies of China and the Soviet Union in the cause of opposing aggression and safeguarding world peace!

    中苏两国军队的战斗友谊万岁
    ——纪念中苏友好同盟互助条约五周年为苏联“红星报”而作
    中国人民解放军总政治部主任　罗荣桓
    中苏友好同盟互助条约，已经签订五年了。五年来的事实一再证明：这个条约的签订，沉重地打击了美帝国主义的侵略政策，打击了美帝国主义复活日本军国主义的阴谋；对保证我国的安全与社会主义建设，对维护亚洲与世界和平，起了极其伟大的作用。当此中苏友好同盟互助条约签订五周年的时候，中国人民及其武装部队——中国人民解放军都感到无比的欢欣，而衷心地感谢苏联给予我国的无私的援助和全力的支持。
    伟大的苏联在马克思列宁主义的国际主义旗帜下，始终如一地以巨大的同情关注我国人民为摆脱帝国主义与封建的枷锁、争取民族解放与社会解放的斗争。中华人民共和国成立后，苏联随即与我国签订了友好同盟互助条约，对我国进行了全面的无私的援助。现在，我国已经顺利地渡过经济恢复时期，进入到有计划的经济建设时期。我国人民正以苏联为榜样，在中国共产党的领导之下，沿着国家的社会主义工业化道路向前迈进，为把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义国家而奋斗。中国人民深切地知道：中国革命的胜利和社会主义建设的每一个重大成就，都是与苏联的同情、支持和援助分不开的。我国人民永远不会忘记苏联这种伟大的兄弟般的友谊，永远把苏联当作自己最忠诚的朋友。中国人民以有苏联这样忠诚的朋友而感到自豪，并对未来充满无限的信心。同时，我们相信：中国人民努力地增强自己的经济力量与国防力量，也必将更加巩固以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营，有助于全体进步人类反对侵略、维护世界和平与争取美好未来的斗争。伟大的列宁早就指出要把西方无产阶级社会主义革命与东方被压迫民族解放运动结合起来，去对付共同的敌人。我们实现了列宁的这个指示。中苏两国人民的友谊与团结，正是这种结合的典范。中苏友好同盟互助条约，使我们两国军队共同承担了伟大的历史任务，从而加深与发展了我们两国军队的战斗友谊。
    中苏两国军队，都是在共产党的领导之下，以马克思列宁主义为指针，为了共同的奋斗目标而战斗的劳动人民的军队。这种政治思想上和斗争目标上的一致，构成了我们两国军队团结与友谊的基础。历史把我们的命运联结在一起。我们的团结与友谊是谁也拆不散的，我们的力量是任何人也摧不毁的。
    举世皆知：苏联武装部队是捍卫苏联人民从事光荣的共产主义建设的强大的力量，是保卫世界和平与人类正义事业的柱石。在伟大卫国战争中苏联武装部队在苏联共产党的领导和苏联人民的支援之下，以自我牺牲精神与英勇卓绝的斗争，保卫了苏维埃祖国的独立与自由，消灭了妄图统治世界的希特勒匪帮，挽救了被奴役的欧洲人民，使中欧和东南欧许多国家从帝国主义剥削的锁链下获得了解放；并且在东方参加了反对日本帝国主义的战争，消灭了日本帝国主义的主力关东军，从而协助中国人民战胜了日本帝国主义。苏联武装部队在伟大卫国战争中所获得的具有世界历史意义的胜利，为中国革命获得全国的胜利创造了极有利的条件。
    苏联武装部队的强大与不可战胜，不仅在于它拥有完全现代化的、为最高科学成就所武装起来的技术装备；而且，更重要地，还在于它有马克思列宁主义的军事科学的指导、它的每个官兵具有崇高的理想和伟大的爱国主义、国际主义精神。苏联武装部队，过去是、现在是、将来也还是中国人民解放军学习的榜样。
    中国人民解放军，从建军的那一天起，就强调了向苏联军队学习。向苏联军队学习，是我军的光荣传统。中国共产党和毛泽东同志创造性地发展了斯大林所指示的武装斗争对中国革命的特殊重要意义的思想，把马克思列宁主义的军事学说与苏军建军的经验，具体地运用于中国革命战争和革命军队建设的实践，创立了人民革命军队，确定了党对军队的绝对领导，建立了军队中的政治工作，制定了一套完整的适合中国革命战争需要的战略战术。中国人民正是依靠这支革命军队，经过长期的艰苦奋斗，推翻了帝国主义及其走狗在中国的血腥统治，赢得了中国革命在全国的胜利。
    中国人民解放军，现在正担负着保卫人民革命成果和祖国社会主义建设，解放祖国领土台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团，防御帝国主义侵略，保卫亚洲与世界和平的伟大历史任务。为完成这个任务，我军正在努力地学习苏联的先进军事科学与苏军建军经验，为把自己建设成为一支优良的现代化革命军队而奋斗。五年以来，我军已经逐步地在原有步兵基础上，建立了各特种兵部队，建立了空军和海军。我军的技术装备已经大大地改善。各种正规制度，正在全军普遍实施。根据苏军按实战要求训练部队的原则，部队正在加紧进行陆、海、空军诸兵种合成军队作战的训练。我军还加强了政治思想教育，官兵的马克思列宁主义思想水平，已有显著提高。此外，我军还创办了各种正规军事学校，为我军现代化提供了军官补充的源泉。由于这些工作的结果，中国人民解放军已在由低级阶段过渡到高级阶段的历史转变过程中，大大向前迈进了一步。
    向苏联军队学习，加速了我军现代化建设的过程，提高了我军的战斗威力，从而更加增强了中苏两国军队在完成共同的历史任务中的必胜的信念。
    大家知道：中国人民和苏联人民一样，都是热爱和平的。我们两国政府都奉行着和平的外交政策。我们愿意同任何不同社会制度和政治制度的国家和平共处。我们决无侵犯他国的意图，但也不允许他国来侵犯我们。在朝鲜停战与印度支那和平恢复之后，亚洲和国际的紧张局势渐趋缓和。但是，美帝国主义并不甘心于自己侵略政策与战争政策的失败，相反地，它为了继续制造国际紧张局势，妄图挑起新的世界战争，它一面在远东胁迫其仆从国家签订敌视中国和亚洲人民的所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”，扶植日本军国主义势力，继续侵占我国领土台湾，加紧利用蒋介石卖国集团对我国沿海进行海盗式的袭扰，最近更加无耻地签订了所谓美蒋
  “共同防御条约”；同时，在西方迫使英法等国加速批准“巴黎协定”，积极武装西德，疯狂地加紧准备原子战争。美帝国主义这种侵略政策和战争政策，对中国、苏联和各人民民主国家的安全，对亚洲与世界的和平，都是一种严重的威胁。中苏两国人民及其武装部队，对于反对侵略者并不是外行，任何恫吓讹诈决然吓不倒我们。我们反对侵略、维护和平的事业得到全体进步人类的同情和支持。我们必须、而且一定能够粉碎美帝国主义的侵略政策与战争政策。中国人民和中国人民解放军一定要解放台湾，消灭蒋介石卖国集团。解放台湾，是中国人民的内政，决不允许他人来干涉。美国军队必须从台湾及台湾海峡撤走。中国人民解放军不解放台湾，决不罢休。中国人民解放军有信心、有力量完成这个任务。
    我国和伟大苏联的坚如磐石的兄弟般的同盟，我国和各人民民主国家紧紧地团结在以苏联为首的和平、民主、社会主义阵营大家庭里，全世界进步人类争取和平、反对侵略的斗争的日益高涨，这就是我国人民及其武装部队能够完成其伟大历史任务的保证。中苏两国军队已经建立了深厚的战斗友谊。现在我们要更加发展这种友谊，巩固这种友谊。因为我们两国人民及其武装部队的友谊，不但影响中苏两国本身，而且影响全人类的未来。
    中苏两国军队在反对侵略、保卫世界和平的事业中所结成的牢不可破的战斗友谊万岁！
