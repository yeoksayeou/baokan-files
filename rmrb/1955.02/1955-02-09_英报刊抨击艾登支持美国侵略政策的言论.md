Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 8th. London Dispatch: British newspapers are criticizing British Foreign Secretary Eden's repeated expressions of support for the United States' aggressive policy on the Taiwan issue, pointing out that China's sovereignty over Taiwan is undeniable.

    The London "Daily Worker" commented on February 5th that Eden's statement in the House of Commons on the 4th "is to cover up the actual occupation of these islands by the United States." Regarding Eden's argument that the administrative power, but not the sovereignty, of Taiwan was handed over to China in 1945, and therefore the sovereignty issue remains unclear, the newspaper said, "This argument ignores the fact that the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation announced that Taiwan was territory 'stolen by' Japan from China, which includes an implicit statement about sovereignty. The use of the word 'stolen' means that China's ownership was recognized. The only action required under these declarations was to return the stolen property to its original owner, and this was done in fact and in law as early as 1945. The second fact that Eden has ignored is that, with the consent of the United States (and without objection from Britain), the then Chinese government officially declared China's sovereignty over Taiwan in 1945, and Taiwan became a province of China. If it is now said that Taiwan was once occupied by Japan and therefore its sovereignty is still questionable, then please let Mr. Anthony Eden pay attention to the Isle of Wight. It was also once occupied by the French."

    The "New Statesman and Nation" weekly on January 29th, in its "London Diary" column, raised such a sharp question to Eden: Eden has enough experience to know what dangers are involved in making such a dishonest claim that Taiwan does not belong to the Chinese, why does he still bring it up?

    The weekly said: "Fear and anger have re-emerged on the streets and among the public, in the House of Commons and even in the clubs on Pall Mall. 'What do the Americans think they are doing?' 'Why do they insist that American security depends on Taiwan?' The Chinese revolution has succeeded, we have recognized it, and it is madness to expect any government - whether communist or not - to allow a group of revenge-seeking exiles to receive foreign aid and then entrench themselves on islands near the coast to wage war against it. What is the difference between these coastal islands and Taiwan? Can it be said that the Isle of Wight and Lundy Island belong to Britain, but the Channel Islands no longer belong to us because they were occupied by Germany during the war?"

    The weekly said, "Many diplomatic situations are indeed very complex and difficult at the moment. But this issue is not really one of these difficult issues, and Eden will no longer think it is, if he can abandon those clichés and state the fact: these islands, including Taiwan, belong to China, and on this issue, the United States is an aggressor. He will find that he is speaking for Britain, and - 'possibly' - preventing a war. At this moment, what is needed is courage and plain speaking, not diplomatic rhetoric."

    In the same issue, the "New Statesman and Nation" weekly also published an article criticizing Eden's statement that "the primary task is to achieve a ceasefire," asking: "How can a ceasefire be achieved when there is such an excuse that the United States is defending an important interest, and Beijing - not Washington - has lit the fuse?" The weekly said: The danger in American war policy is undoubtedly very obvious. "As long as the United States continues to support the Kuomintang, a dangerous crisis is inevitable."

    英报刊抨击艾登支持美国侵略政策的言论
   【新华社柏林八日电】伦敦消息：英国报刊抨击英国外交大臣艾登一再表示支持美国在台湾问题上的侵略政策的言论，指出中国对台湾的主权是无法抹煞的。
    伦敦“工人日报”五日评论艾登四日在下院发表的声明“是要掩饰美国对这些岛屿的实际占领”。报纸谈到艾登所谓台湾的行政权而不是主权在一九四五年交给了中国、因此主权问题仍然不清楚的论调，报纸说，“这种论调忽视了开罗宣言和波茨坦公告宣布台湾是日本‘窃取于’中国的领土就包含了一种不言而喻的关于主权的声明这一事实。用‘窃取’这个字眼就是说中国的所有权是得到承认的。根据这些宣言所需要采取的唯一行动就是把被窃取的财产归还原主，而这一点在一九四五年已经尽早地在事实上和法律上做到了。艾登忽视了的第二个事实是，在美国的同意下（英国也没有表示异议），当时的中国政府已经在一九四五年正式宣布了中国对台湾的主权而台湾就成了中国的一个省份。如果现在竟说台湾曾一度被日本占领因此它的主权仍有疑问的话，那么请安东尼·艾登先生留神威地岛吧。它也一度被法国人占领过。”
    一月二十九日的“新政治家与民族”周刊在它的“伦敦日记”栏上向艾登提出了这样一个尖锐的问题：艾登有足够经验知道提出台湾不是中国人的这样一种不诚实的说法会有什么危险，为什么他还这样提出来呢？
    这家周刊说：“目前在街道上和公众间，在下院和甚至在派尔马尔街上的俱乐部里又重新产生了恐惧和愤怒。‘美国人以为他们自己在做的是什么事？’‘为什么他们硬说美国的安全取决于台湾？’中国的革命已经实现，我们已经承认了它，希望任何一个政府——不管是不是共产党政府——容许一批要想复仇的被逐者得到外国的帮助，然后盘踞在海岸附近的岛屿上，对它制造战争，那简直是发疯。究竟这些沿海岛屿和台湾之间有什么分别呢？难道可以说，威地岛和浪地岛是英国的，但是海峡岛屿却已不属于我们，因为它们在战争期间曾被德国所占领过？”
    周刊说，“目前有许多外交形势的确是很复杂和困难的。但这个问题并不真是这些困难问题之一，而艾登也不会再认为它是，如果他能够放弃那些陈词烂调，而说明这一事实：这些岛屿，包括台湾在内，是属于中国的，在这个问题上，美国是个侵略者。他将发现他是在代表英国说话，并且—— ‘可能’——是在制止战争。在目前这个时候，所需要的是勇气和明白说话，而不是外交辞令。”
    同一期的“新政治家与民族”周刊还刊登文章指责艾登关于“首要任务就是获致停火”的说法，它问道：“当有这样一种借口说，美国正在保卫一个重要的利益，而北京——不是华盛顿——已经点火燎原的时候，怎样能实现停火呢？”周刊说：美国战争政策中的危险无疑地是很明显的。“只要美国继续支持国民党，危险的危机就是不可避免的。”
