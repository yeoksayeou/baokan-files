    The proportion of commodities wholesaled by Tianjin's state-owned commerce in the total social commodity circulation has increased from 81.47% in 1953 to the current 93.1%. Ninety-one major commodities, including grain, cotton cloth, rubber products, cigarettes, fuel, and chemical raw materials, are now entirely controlled by state-owned commerce. Private retailers must purchase their main commodities from state-owned commercial departments. Tianjin's municipal-level state-owned commercial companies added 26 wholesale outlets last year to facilitate purchases by private merchants. Currently, retailers in five industries in Tianjin—cotton cloth, grain, edible oil, coal, and tea—have all become sales agents or commission agents for state-owned companies. Retailers in thirty-one industries, including general merchandise and pharmaceuticals, have established wholesale and procurement relationships with state-owned companies. According to statistics from the Tianjin Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce, in January, the value of purchases made by private retailers in twenty-six industries, including general merchandise, pharmaceuticals, and cotton cloth, from state-owned companies accounted for 72.3% of their total purchases.

    天津国营商业掌握了主要商品的批发业务
    天津市国营商业批发的商品在社会商品流转额中的比重已由一九五三年的百分之八十一点四七，上升到现在百分之九十三点一。粮食、棉布、胶制品、卷烟、燃料、化工原料等九十一类主要商品已全部为国营商业所掌握。私营零售商经营的主要商品都要从国营商业部门进货。天津国营商业市一级的公司，去年增设了二十六个批发门市部，以便利私商进货。现在天津市棉布、粮食、食油、煤、茶叶等五个行业的零售商已全部成为国营公司的经销店或代销店，百货、医药等三十一个行业的零售商已和国营公司建立了批购和进货关系。据天津市工商局的统计：一月份，百货、医药、棉布等二十六个行业私营零售商向国营公司进货的金额占其总进货金额的百分之七十二点三。
