    China to Conduct Large-Scale Oil Survey This Year
    With the development of the nation's socialist industrialization, the state's need for petroleum is increasing. Therefore, starting in 1955, the Ministry of Geology will carry out surveys and partial detailed surveys of oil and natural gas, to propose oil prospects, delineate the most promising oil areas, and provide reserves for detailed surveys, fine measurements, and drilling. This will rapidly increase the industrial reserves of oil and natural gas to meet national needs.
    Recently, the Ministry of Geology convened the first Oil Survey Work Conference. It preliminarily analyzed existing geological data, listened to the work summary reports of the Petroleum Administration Bureau over the past few years, and the reports of Soviet experts from the former Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company introducing advanced work experience. Based on advanced Soviet petroleum geological theories, it was unanimously agreed that the prospects for oil in China's vast land are very promising. The conference determined the guiding principle for this year's oil survey work: to carry out survey work and partial detailed survey work in known oil and gas fields and their surrounding most promising areas, to provide reserves for detailed surveys and fine measurements; to conduct route geological surveys or regional geological surveys in promising areas with good geological conditions and some oil and gas indications, to further understand the geological situation, and to initially evaluate the prospects for oil and gas; to gradually and comprehensively sort out and study old geological data, and to infer possible oil and gas-bearing areas from geological theory, and to carry out general surveys and inspections; to propose future work directions; through survey work, to learn advanced Soviet science and technology, first of all, to comprehensively learn from the work experience of the former Sino-Soviet Petroleum Company, to improve technical and business levels, and to train cadres, thereby strengthening the various forces of oil survey.
    The conference decided to organize five oil survey brigades according to regions, leading twenty-four geological teams, six shallow drilling teams, eighteen geophysical teams, one geodetic survey team, and topographic measurement and latitude and longitude measurement teams corresponding to geology and geophysics. They will go to Xinjiang, Qinghai, Sichuan, the Ordos Platform area, and the North China Plain and other vast areas to carry out work, in order to understand and grasp the basic situation of petroleum geology in each area, and to discover and delineate good structures that may store oil for fine measurement and drilling. At the same time, in-depth scientific research will be carried out to demonstrate the oil prospects of various regions, assess the industrial value of oil-bearing areas, and further lay a scientific foundation for the country to build a strong petroleum industry.
    In order to rapidly carry out survey work and ensure the smooth completion of the survey tasks, the Ministry of Geology has now begun to mobilize forces, organize teams, and is preparing design budgets and stepping up preparations for a series of pre-departure work. The teams will depart one after another and are expected to enter the construction site in March or April.

    我国今年将进行大规模的石油普查
    随着国家社会主义工业化的发展，国家对石油提出了日益增长的需要。因此地质部将从一九五五年起开展石油与天然气的普查和部分详查的工作，以提出石油远景，圈定最有希望的油区，提供详查、细测和钻探的后备地，以便能迅速增加石油和天然气的工业储量，来满足国家需要。
    最近，地质部召开了第一次石油普查工作会议，初步分析了已有地质资料，听取了石油管理总局几年来工作总结的报告和前中苏石油公司苏联专家介绍先进工作经验的报告，并根据苏联先进的石油地质理论，一致认为在我国广大的土地上，石油的远景是很有希望的。会议确定了今年石油普查工作的方针是：在已知油气田及其外围最有希望地区，进行普查工作和部分详查工作，以提供详查细测的后备地；在具有良好地质条件与某些有油气征象的有希望地区，进行路线地质调查或区域地质测量，进一步了解地质情况，初步评价含油气的远景；逐步地、全面地整理研究旧有地质资料，并从地质理论上推断可能含油气地区，进行概略普查和检查工作；提出今后工作方向；通过普查工作，学习苏联先进科学技术，首先是全面学习前中苏石油公司的工作经验，以提高技术业务水平，培养干部，从而壮大石油普查的各种力量。
    会议确定按地区组织五个石油普查大队，分别领导二十四个地质队，六个浅钻队，十八个地球物理队，一个大地测量队，及与地质和物探相应的地形测量和经纬度测量队，分赴新疆、青海、四川、鄂尔多斯地台区及华北平原等广大地区进行工作，以便了解和掌握各该区石油地质的基本情况，发现和圈定可能储油的良好构造，以供细测和钻探。与此同时，将进行深入的科学研究，论证各地区的石油远景，评定含油地区的工业价值，为国家建设强大的石油工业进一步奠定科学的基础。
    为了迅速开展普查工作，并保证普查任务的顺利完成，地质部现已开始调集力量，组织队伍，并正进行编制设计预算，加紧作好出发前的一系列准备工作。各队将陆续出发，预计将于三、四月间进入工地。
