Xinhua News Agency, February 24th: The work of enlisting supplementary soldiers is now widely underway throughout the country, and the vast number of young people of military age are enthusiastically responding to the call of the state and actively signing up for service.

Since the former Central People's Government's Government Administration Council announced the order on enlisting supplementary soldiers, the people of the whole country, especially young people of military age, have expressed their active support and enthusiastic response, considering this a good opportunity to fulfill their sacred duty and glorious obligation to defend peace and the security of the motherland. In the process of actively enlisting for military service, the vast number of young people of military age in various places have fully demonstrated a high degree of patriotism. According to statistics from Rehe Province in early February, the number of young people of military age who signed up for enlistment in the province has exceeded the planned enlistment target by eight times. In the Horqin Left Wing Middle Banner of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, 99.7 percent of young people of military age have signed up for enlistment. In many areas of Henan Province, the number of young people of military age who signed up for enlistment also accounted for more than 90 to 95 percent of the total number of young people of military age in the area. In Gongtong Township, Liujiang County, Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Guangxi Province, on the day of registration for enlistment, all the young people of military age in the township ran to the entrance of the township government very early; when the announcement of the start of registration was made, the young people who wanted to enlist rushed to the registration table and eagerly registered.

Throughout the country, many moving and exemplary instances of wives sending their husbands, parents sending their sons, and brothers vying to enlist have emerged in the process of enlistment. According to statistics from Tongliang and Qijiang counties and the suburbs of Nanchong City in Sichuan Province alone, there were more than 1,000 cases of parents sending their sons and wives sending their husbands to enlist. Long Weiguo, a young man from Changrong Township, Naxi County, Sichuan Province, had requested to join the army in 1953, but was not approved at that time due to insufficient conditions; since then, he has actively exercised regularly, and this time, when supplementary soldiers were enlisted, he took the lead in enlisting. When he passed the physical examination, he jumped up happily and said, "I've been waiting for two years, and I've finally got it. This time, it's time for me to fulfill my duty to defend the motherland." Hu Xudao's two younger brothers, Hu Xutong and Hu Xuqian, both wanted to persuade the other to stay at home while they enlisted, but neither could persuade the other. In the end, their mother agreed to let both brothers go to sign up for enlistment together. Li Shaomei, an old woman from Li'ersi Township, Tong County, Hebei Province, said when sending her son to enlist, "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao gave us land and saved us poor people from suffering. Our country and the fruits of victory must be protected. I have five sons, and whichever one is qualified should go."

In the process of enlistment, many young people of military age who were not yet married voluntarily postponed their wedding dates and resolutely requested to enlist for military service first. After Han Lin, a young man of military age from Weichang County, Rehe Province, signed up for enlistment and passed the physical examination, his fiancée, Xiao Guifen, made a special trip to see him off, and the two made a plan to compete with each other to see who could make faster progress. Chen Zongyan, a young man from Sancha Township, Xinyang County, Henan Province, had already received his marriage certificate, but after hearing the order to enlist supplementary soldiers, he felt that everyone had a responsibility to defend the motherland, and with the consent of his fiancée and family, he immediately signed up to respond to the call for enlistment. When Tan Guanchun, a woman from Laibin County, Guangxi Province, sent her fiancé to sign up for enlistment, she encouraged her fiancé and said, "It is glorious to enlist in the army and defend the motherland, and I will definitely wait for you."

    履行保卫和平、保卫祖国的光荣义务
    广大适龄青年踊跃应征服兵役
    【新华社二十四日讯】全国各地征集补充兵员的工作已普遍展开，广大适龄青年热烈响应国家号召，踊跃报名应征。
    自从前中央人民政府政务院公布关于征集补充兵员的命令以后，全国各地人民，特别是适龄青年都表示积极拥护和热烈响应，认为这是履行自己保卫和平、保卫祖国安全的神圣职责和光荣义务的好机会。各地广大适龄青年在踊跃应征服兵役的过程中，充分表现出高度的爱国主义热情。热河省二月初的统计，全省适龄青年报名应征者已超过预定征集任务的八倍。内蒙古自治区科尔沁左翼中旗有百分之九十九点七的适龄青年都报名应征。河南省有很多地区报名应征的适龄青年也都占当地适龄青年总数的百分之九十到九十五以上。广西省桂西僮族自治区柳江县恭桐乡在报名应征的那天，全乡适龄青年很早就跑到乡政府门口；当宣布报名开始时，应征的青年便一齐拥到报名台前，争先报了名。
    全国各地青年在应征过程中出现了妻子送丈夫、父母送儿子、兄弟争相应征的许许多多动人的模范事例。仅据四川省铜梁、綦江两县和南充市郊的统计，父母送儿子、妻子送丈夫应征的就有一千多起。四川省纳溪县常荣乡青年龙卫国在一九五三年曾要求参军，当时因条件不够没被批准；从此他便经常地积极锻炼身体，在这次征集补充兵员时，他又带头应征，当检查身体合格后，他高兴得跳了起来，说：“盼了两年，终于盼到了，这次可是我尽保卫祖国的职责的时候了。”家住四川省的中国人民志愿军一级英雄胡修道的两个弟弟胡修同和胡修乾，都想说服对方留在家里而自己应征，但是谁也说服不了谁，最后他们的妈妈同意让弟兄两人一起去报名应征。河北省通县里二泗乡李绍梅老婆婆在送儿子应征时说：“共产党、毛主席给了我们土地，使我们穷人不受苦，我们的国家和胜利果实必须有人保护，我有五个儿子，那个合格就叫那个去。”
    在应征过程中，有很多未结婚的适龄青年虽然婚期快到了，但自愿推迟结婚时间，坚决要求首先应征服兵役。热河省围场县适龄青年韩林报名应征经检查身体合格后，他的未婚妻肖桂芬特地赶来给他送行，两人并订了计划，互相比赛看谁进步快。河南省信阳县三茶乡青年陈宗言，已经领了结婚证书，但他听到征集补充兵员的命令后，感到保卫祖国人人有责，因而在取得未婚妻和家人的同意后，马上报名响应了征集号召。广西省来宾县妇女谭冠春在送她的未婚夫报名应征时，鼓励她的未婚夫说：“应征服兵役保卫祖国是光荣的，我一定等着你。”
