    Japanese Public Demands a Peaceful and Independent Foreign Policy
    Left-Wing Socialist Party Demands Immediate Negotiations with the Soviet Union on Japanese-Soviet Relations
    [Xinhua News Agency, 4th] Tokyo Dispatch: The Tokyo Broadcasting Association hosted a campaign speech rally in Tokyo on the 3rd, attended by 10,000 people. Leaders of the left and right wings of the Socialist Party, the Japan Democratic Party, and the Liberal Party delivered campaign speeches at the rally. This rally clearly demonstrated the Japanese public's desire for peace and opposition to subservience to the United States.
    Agence France-Presse reported that "the lesson learned from today's rally is that the election struggle will be conducted on the major issue of foreign policy," and "peace and independence" are the slogans calling on voters in the election. Left-wing Socialist Party Chairman Suzuki Mosaburo, Right-wing Socialist Party Chairman Jotaro Kawakami, and Japan Democratic Party President Ichiro Hatoyama's speeches all "criticized former Prime Minister Yoshida's government for obeying the orders of the American authorities and failing to protect Japan's national interests." They said: "The time has come to take action independently of Washington's influence and establish normal relations with the communist camp." Suzuki Mosaburo demanded a complete break from Japan's dependence on the United States, the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Japan, and opposition to Japan's rearmament.
    Liberal Party President and former Deputy Prime Minister of the Yoshida government, Takeo Ogata's speech openly opposed negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union to normalize relations between the two countries. Agence France-Presse said that his speech was met with "relentless scolding" from the masses, while Ichiro Hatoyama's speech, which attacked the pro-American stance of the former Yoshida government while "repeatedly guaranteeing that the Japan-US alliance is the cornerstone of his policy," aroused "ridicule" from the masses.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 4th] TASS, 3rd: According to a Japanese radio report: The leading body of the Japanese Left-wing Socialist Party held a meeting in Tokyo on February 2 to discuss the normalization of Japanese-Soviet relations.
    The meeting passed a resolution requesting the Japanese government to immediately accept the Soviet proposal and begin negotiations with the Soviet government.
    The resolution also called for the development of scientific and cultural relations with the Soviet Union and pointed out the need to immediately conclude trade and fisheries agreements.

    日本公众要求执行和平独立的外交政策
    左派社会党要求立即同苏联谈判日苏关系
    【新华社四日讯】东京消息：东京广播协会三日在东京主办了一个竞选演说群众大会，参加大会的有一万人。左、右两派社会党，日本民主党和自由党的领袖都在大会上发表了竞选演说。这次大会明显地表现了日本公众要求和平、反对屈从美国的愿望。
    据法新社报道说：“从今天的大会上得到的教训是，选举斗争将在外交政策这个主要问题上进行”，“和平和独立”是竞选中号召选民的口号。左派社会党主席铃木茂三郎、右派社会党主席河上丈太郎和日本民主党总裁鸠山一郎的演说都“批评前吉田首相的政府唯美国当局的命令是从，而不能保护日本的民族利益”。他们说：“采取不受华盛顿影响的行动，同共产党阵营建立正常关系的时间已经来到了”。铃木茂三郎在演说中要求完全摆脱日本对美国的依附地位，要一切外国军队撤出日本，并且反对日本重新武装。
    自由党总裁、前吉田政府副首相绪方竹虎的演说公开地反对日本和苏联进行使两国关系正常化的谈判。法新社说，他的演说受到群众“无情的责骂”，而鸠山一郎在攻击前吉田政府亲美的同时又“一再保证日美联盟是他的政策的基石”的演说，引起了群众的“嘲笑”。
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社三日讯：据日本电台报道：日本左派社会党的领导机构二月二日在东京举行会议讨论日苏关系正常化问题。
    会议通过决定，要求日本政府马上接受苏联建议，并开始同苏联政府举行谈判。
    这个决定还要求发展同苏联的科学和文化关系，并且指出立即缔结贸易协定和渔业协定的必要性。
