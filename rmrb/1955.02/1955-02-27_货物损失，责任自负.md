    "Goods Damaged, Responsibility Borne by the Owner"

    To the Editor:
    On December 29, 1954, a shipment of 190 iron drums of white liquor, weighing 33 tons, was sent from Tongxian Station to Shangqiu Station. Upon arrival at Shijiazhuang Station, it was discovered that 33 drums were leaking, resulting in a loss of 4,600 jin of white liquor. Calculated at a retail price of 10,800 yuan per jin, the loss amounted to over 49 million yuan in Renminbi. Why did such a situation occur during transportation? It turned out that the poor quality of the iron drums had already been noticed at the time of shipment. The dispatching unit, the Tongxian Prefecture Monopoly Affairs Office, wrote on the waybill: "Twelve drums are smeared with soap at the waist, the owner bears the responsibility," and then shipped them.
    On January 1 this year, a shipment of 121 iron drums of white liquor, weighing 21.7 tons, was sent from Shunyi Station to Xi'an Station. Upon arrival at Shijiazhuang Station, it was again discovered that 31 drums were leaking. Because the weight of the goods exceeded the accepted carrying weight, the number of losses could not be calculated. Similarly, the poor quality of the iron drums had already been noticed when this batch of goods was dispatched. The station and the owner (Monopoly Affairs Office) wrote in the record: Most of the iron drums were leaking at the screw mouths and at the bottom, and there were also 20 leaks at the waist of the drums; although the leaks were soldered with tin, they were still likely to leak during train operation and loading and unloading, and the responsibility was borne by the consignor.
    The words "Goods Damaged, Responsibility Borne by the Owner" were noted on the transport documents, which seemed to be a "willingness to take responsibility," but unfortunately: they were not responsible for doing their job well, but were "responsible" for causing losses to state property. The railway side clearly knew that the leakage of white liquor was a loss to the state, but because the owner declared responsibility, it seemed that this loss had nothing to do with them, so they did not act in accordance with railway regulations and allowed poorly packaged goods to be transported.
    These two incidents show that some of our enterprise cadres still lack a sense of responsibility for state property. In transportation work, such incidents are not limited to the above two cases. This should attract the general attention of all consigning units and railway departments.

### “货物损失，责任自负”

    “货物损失，责任自负”编辑同志：
    一九五四年十二月二十九日，从通县车站发往商邱车站铁桶装白酒一车，共一百九十桶，重三十三吨。到石家庄站时，发现有三十三桶渗漏，共损失白酒四千六百市斤。按零售价格每市斤一万零八百元计算，这笔损失达人民币四千九百余万元。为什么在运输途中会出现这样的情况呢？原来在发运时，已经发现铁桶质量不好。发货单位通县专署专卖事业处在运单上签注了“内十二桶腰部用肥皂涂抹，货主自负”字样，就把它运出了。
    今年一月一日，由顺义站发往西安站铁桶装白酒一车，共一百二十一桶，重二十一点七吨。到石家庄站时，又发现有三十一桶渗漏，因为货重超过承运重量，损失数字无法计算。同样，这批货物在发运时也已经发现铁桶质量不好，车站和货主（专卖事业处）在记录上写着：铁桶螺丝口处和桶底大部渗漏，桶腰也有二十处渗漏；渗漏处虽用锡焊住，但在列车运行和装卸作业中恐仍会渗漏，责任由发货人自负。
    在运输单据上注明了“货物损失，责任自负”的字样，看上去好像是“勇于负责”的样子，但可惜的是：他们不是负责把工作做好，却是“负责”让国家财产受到损失。铁路方面明明知道白酒渗漏是国家的损失，因为货主声明了责任自负，似乎这个损失就与我无关，也就不按铁路规章办事，任凭包装不好的货物运出去。
    这两个事件，说明我们某些企业干部还缺少对国家财产负责的态度。在运输工作中，这样的事件并不仅仅是上述两件而已。这就值得引起各托运单位和铁路部门的普遍注意。
