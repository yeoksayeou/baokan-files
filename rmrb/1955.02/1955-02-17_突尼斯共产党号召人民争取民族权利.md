Xinhua News Agency, February 16th Dispatch from Paris: “l'Humanité” published a statement by the Tunisian Communist Party on the 15th, calling on the Tunisian people to wage a resolute struggle for national rights.

The statement discussed the negotiations between France and Tunisia, which began in September of last year, regarding France granting internal autonomy to Tunisia. The statement pointed out that, in reality, the secrecy of these negotiations, the unilateral concessions made by Tunisia during the negotiations, and the political policies of the leaders of Tunisia's New Constitution Party and the Tahar Ben Ammar government, encouraged the French colonialists who were unwilling to grant internal autonomy to Tunisia.

The Tunisian Communist Party has consistently pointed out that the fate of the Tunisian people must never depend on the policies of the French government, and it has pointed out that the achievements that the Tunisian people have already made and are able to make depend entirely on their national struggle and the support given by their friends in France and throughout the world.

The statement finally emphasized that the Tunisian people must also wage a resolute struggle for the internal autonomy that the Mendès-France government had solemnly guaranteed them.

    突尼斯共产党号召人民争取民族权利
     【新华社十六日讯】巴黎消息：“人道报”十五日刊载了突尼斯共产党的一项声明，号召突尼斯人民为争取民族权利进行坚决斗争。
    声明谈到去年九月间开始的法国和突尼斯之间关于法国给予突尼斯以内政自治权的谈判的情况，声明指出：实际上，这些谈判的秘密性，谈判中突尼斯单方面的让步，以及突尼斯新宪政党的领导人士和塔哈尔·阿玛尔政府的政治方针，对于不愿意给予突尼斯以内政自治的法国殖民主义者起了鼓励的作用。
    突尼斯共产党一贯指出，突尼斯人民的命运决不能取决于法国政府的政策，并且指出：突尼斯人民所已经取得和能够取得的成就完全靠他们所进行的民族斗争和他们在法国和全世界的朋友们所给予的支持。
    声明最后强调指出，突尼斯人民还必须为孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府曾郑重保证给予他们的内政自治进行坚决的斗争。
