Encouraging Aggression Will Never Be Beneficial
Jiang Yuanchun

Not long ago, British Prime Minister Churchill, in his speech at Woodford, showed that he was a man who could do fickle and perfidious things: in 1945, he could send a telegram to Marshal Stalin, thanking the Soviet army for its powerful offensive on the Soviet-German battlefield that saved the British army, while at the same time sending a telegram to Marshal Montgomery, asking him to carefully collect German weapons in order to rearm German soldiers to fight the Soviet Union.

On February 1, Churchill's speech in the British House of Commons showed that he wanted to do something like that again. He could sign the "Cairo Declaration" with one hand, but tear it up with the other.

The "Cairo Declaration" of December 1, 1943, by China, the United States, and Britain, stipulated that Taiwan would be returned to China after the war. Churchill, representing the British government, signed the declaration. According to this declaration, after the Soviet Union declared war on Japan in 1945, prompting Japan to surrender, Taiwan was returned to China.

Now, the same Churchill told the British House of Commons that the "Cairo Declaration" "merely contained a statement of common purpose." The implication is that he wants to discard the international obligations that Britain assumed because of the "Cairo Declaration."

Is this argument by the British Prime Minister tenable?

From the point of view of international law, the "Cairo Declaration" is an official statement signed by the heads of the governments concerned, and the agreement contained therein regarding the status of Northeast China (Manchuria), Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands is legally binding on each signatory country. The British international law scholar Lauterpacht expressed this view in his edited "Oppenheim's International Law." The British government has no reason to abandon the obligations it undertook by signing the "Cairo Declaration" and not recognize that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory.

In fact, after Japan's surrender, the "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation," which reaffirmed this declaration, have been implemented. Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and Northeast China (Manchuria), which had been forcibly occupied by Japan, have been returned to China and become part of Chinese territory. A spokesman for the British Foreign Office also admitted on August 25, 1954, that "'The Cairo Declaration' said that Taiwan should be returned to China - and this has been done."

Since this is the case, Taiwan is Chinese territory, and this status has certainly been determined long ago, just as Northeast China (Manchuria) is Chinese territory. This is not a problem.

The problem is the attitude of the British Prime Minister.

This Prime Minister told the British House of Commons that "many things have happened since the declaration was issued." He also said that "the situation has changed, and the Taiwan issue has become an international issue closely related to several other countries."

Indeed, "many things have happened." The Chinese people liberated the entire mainland, and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique fled to Taiwan, hiding under the protection of the United States. The British government recognized the People's Republic of China and expressed its willingness to respect China's territorial integrity and sovereignty. Immediately afterwards, the United States occupied Taiwan in 1950, protecting the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's attacks on the Chinese people, and increasingly threatening to use war to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan.

What is the attitude of this British Prime Minister?

As a signatory to the "Cairo Declaration," he has no objection to the United States' violation of the "Cairo Declaration." As the Prime Minister of the British government, which recognizes China, he does not express his willingness to respect China's sovereignty over Taiwan. The Chinese people's liberation of their own territory, Taiwan, is entirely China's internal affair. This British Prime Minister ignores it. The United States' occupation of Chinese territory Taiwan has created international tensions, making Taiwan an international issue, and this Prime Minister even wants to find a legal basis for the United States' aggressive behavior, to overthrow the already determined status of Taiwan.

Obviously, this attitude of doing everything possible to serve the US's aggressive and war policies is completely inconsistent with the peaceful aims of the British government, which claims to want to ease the situation.

Churchill's government recognized China but attempted to split China and create "two Chinas." This is another manifestation of his fickleness. The "Chicago Tribune" reported on January 23 that "the Churchill government is considering a plan to establish an independent state in Taiwan headed by Chiang Kai-shek." It is worth noting that Australian Minister of the Interior Hughes has arrived in Hong Kong and is about to go to Taiwan. According to the reactionary Taiwan newspaper "News World," Hughes's trip is aimed at exploring the possibility of establishing diplomatic relations with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique on behalf of the British government. The Chinese people are closely watching these ambiguous activities on the British side.

No matter what the attitude of the British side is, it is impossible to influence the Chinese people or change the path of the Chinese people. Those who try to condone and encourage aggression by tearing up international agreements can only increasingly expose themselves as accomplices of the aggressors in front of the people. In the end, this will certainly not do them any good.

    鼓励侵略决不会有好处
    蒋元椿
    不久以前，英国首相邱吉尔在伍德佛的演说中表明了他可以做一些反复无常、背信弃义的事情的人：他在一九四五年可以一面打电报给斯大林大元帅，感谢苏联军队在苏德战场上的强大攻势拯救了英国军队，一面却打电报给蒙哥马利元帅，要他仔细搜集德国人的武器，以便重新武装德国士兵来打苏联。
    二月一日，邱吉尔在英国下院中的演说，表明他又想这样干一下。他可以一只手在“开罗宣言”上签字，另一只手却要把“开罗宣言”撕毁。
    一九四三年十二月一日中、美、英三国的“开罗宣言”规定，台湾在战后归还中国。代表英国政府在宣言上签字的是邱吉尔。根据这个宣言，在一九四五年苏联对日宣战促使日本投降以后，台湾归还了中国。
    现在，同一个邱吉尔却告诉英国下院说，“开罗宣言”“仅仅包含了一种共同目的的声明”。言下之意就是想把英国因“开罗宣言”而承担的国际义务丢掉。
    英国首相这种论调难道是站得住脚的吗？
    从国际法的观点来说，“开罗宣言”是有关各国政府首脑签署的官方声明，其中所包含的关于中国的东北（满洲）、台湾、澎湖的地位问题的协议，对于各签字国具有法律上的约束力。英国的国际法学者劳特派特在他所编的“奥本海国际法”一书中就表示了这样的观点。英国政府没有任何理由抛弃由于签署“开罗宣言”而承担的义务，不承认台湾是中国领土的一部分。
    从事实上来说，在日本投降以后，“开罗宣言”和重申这一宣言的“波茨坦公告”都已经付诸实施。曾被日本强占的台湾、澎湖和中国的东北（满洲）都归还了中国，成为中国领土的一部分。英国外交部的发言人在一九五四年八月二十五日还承认，“‘开罗宣言’说，台湾应归还给中国——这一点已经做到了。”
    既然如此，台湾是中国的领土，这个地位当然是早已确定了的，正如中国的东北（满洲）是中国的领土一样。这是不成问题的。
    成问题的是英国首相的态度。
    这位首相向英国下院说，“自从宣言发表以来，已发生了许多事情。”他又说，“局势已经改变了，台湾问题已经变成了一个若干其他国家都密切有关的国际问题。”
    的确，“已经发生了许多事情”。中国人民解放了全国大陆，蒋介石卖国集团逃去了台湾，躲在美国的庇护之下。英国政府承认了中华人民共和国，并且表示愿意尊重中国的领土主权的完整。紧接着，美国在一九五○年侵占了台湾，庇护蒋介石卖国集团进攻中国人民，并且越来越凶恶地威胁着要用战争来阻挠中国人民解放台湾。
    英国这位首相的态度怎么样呢？
    作为“开罗宣言”的签字人，他对美国违反
  “开罗宣言”的行为却毫无异议。作为承认中国的英国政府的首相，他却不表示愿意尊重中国对台湾的主权。中国人民解放自己的领土台湾，完全是中国的内政问题。这位英国首相却不加理会。美国侵占中国领土台湾造成了国际紧张局势，使台湾成为国际问题，这位首相却还要替美国的侵略行为找合法根据，替它推翻已经确定了的台湾地位。
    显然，这种竭力为美国侵略政策和战争政策服务的态度同英国政府所声言的为了和缓局势的和平目的绝不相符。
    邱吉尔政府承认了中国，却企图割裂中国，制造“两个中国”，这是他的反复无常的又一个表现。美国“芝加哥论坛报”在一月二十三日报道说，“邱吉尔政府正在考虑一个计划，要在台湾建立一个以蒋介石为首的独立国家。”值得注意的是澳大利亚的内政部长休士已经到达香港，即将前往台湾。据台湾的反动报刊“新闻世界”透露，休士此行的目的是为了替英国政府试探和蒋介石卖国集团建立外交关系。中国人民正在密切注意着英国方面的这些暧昧活动。
    无论英国方面的态度怎么样，它是不可能影响中国人民，也改变不了中国人民的道路的。那些企图用撕毁国际协定来纵容和鼓励侵略的人们只能在人民面前越来越暴露他们自己是侵略者的帮凶。到头来，这对他们当然不会有什么好处。
