    We Must Liberate Our Territory - Taiwan
    Lai Ruoyu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
    As long as Taiwan remains under the bloody rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the Chinese people's cause of liberating all of China will not be finally completed. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan.
    Recently, the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, with unparalleled power, liberated Yijiangshan Island in two hours. This is an action in the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan. This heroic action proves that the Chinese people can definitely liberate Taiwan. However, the American warmongering clique, which has consistently been hostile to the Chinese people, is blatantly carrying out war provocations against our country, declaring that it will mobilize its armed forces to attack us to "defend" Taiwan, while manipulating the United Nations to play the trick of so-called "ceasefire."
    Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the sacred cause of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan brooks no interference from anyone. If the United States wants to interfere in this great liberation cause of the Chinese people, it will definitely encounter the resolute counterattack of the Chinese working class and the people of the whole country. The Chinese people love peace and oppose war, but if others impose war on us, we are never afraid to wage a war of self-defense against aggression.
    The Chinese people must never implement any "ceasefire" with the Chinese rebel and traitor. The Chinese people will never give up until the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is eliminated and Taiwan is liberated.
    The Chinese working class and the people of the whole country have been tested by war. The war clamor of American imperialism cannot frighten the Chinese people who have already stood up. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese working class, together with the people of the whole country, must heighten our vigilance and never allow any enemy plots to succeed. We must redouble our efforts, contribute our wisdom and greatest strength, complete and overfulfill the national construction plan, and support the great struggle to liberate Taiwan with practical actions.

    我们一定要解放自己的领土——台湾
    中华全国总工会主席　赖若愚
    只要台湾仍然处在蒋介石卖国集团的血腥统治下，中国人民解放全中国的事业就不算最后完成。台湾是中国的领土，中国人民一定要解放台湾。
    最近英勇的中国人民解放军，以无比的威力在两小时内就解放了一江山岛，这是中国人民解放台湾的斗争中的一个行动。这个英勇的行动，证明了中国人民一定可以解放台湾。可是一贯与中国人民为敌的美国好战集团，竟明目张胆地向我国进行战争挑衅，声言要调动它的武装部队为“保卫”台湾而向我们进攻，同时，操纵联合国玩弄所谓“停火”的阴谋诡计。
    台湾是中国的领土，中国人民解放台湾这一神圣事业，是不准许任何人干涉的，美国要干涉中国人民这一伟大的解放事业，一定要遇到中国工人阶级和全国人民的坚决回击。中国人民酷爱和平反对战争，但是如果别人把战争强加在我们头上的时候，我们也绝不怕进行反抗侵略的自卫战争。
    中国人民绝不能和中国的叛逆卖国贼实行什么“停火”。不消灭蒋介石卖国集团、解放台湾，中国人民决不罢休。
    中国工人阶级和全国人民是经过战争考验的，美国帝国主义的战争叫嚣是吓不倒已经站起来了的中国人民的。中国工人阶级在中国共产党领导下，和全国人民一道，一定要提高警惕，绝不让敌人任何阴谋诡计得逞。我们一定要加倍努力，贡献出自己的智慧和最大的力量，完成和超额完成国家建设计划，用实际行动支援解放台湾的伟大斗争。
