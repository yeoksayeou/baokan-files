The Chiang army officers captured in the Battle of Yijiangshan Island said: We, who experienced the Battle of Yijiangshan Island, all realize this: it is impossible for the Kuomintang to defend the coastal islands and Taiwan.

Wang Fubi, the captured former Chiang bandit assault fourth battalion commander, said that when the People's Liberation Army launched the landing operation, he remembered what Yu Dawei, the Chiang bandit "Minister of Defense," had said. He said: "One evening in November last year, Yu Dawei accompanied Chiang Kai-shek's son Chiang Ching-kuo and more than ten American advisors to Yijiangshan, and called us to him. Yu Dawei said: 'Yijiangshan is the gateway to Dachen, and Dachen is the shield of Taiwan; if Yijiangshan is lost, Dachen will be difficult to defend; if Dachen is lost, Taiwan will be in danger.' In the past, I thought that Yijiangshan Island had solid fortifications and rugged terrain, and that we could hold it for at least dozens of hours, but in reality, the People's Liberation Army annihilated our 1,000-plus troops in just two hours after landing. I myself was captured at around 3:00 PM that day."

Wang Fubi said: "Chiang Kai-shek, in order to boost the morale of the troops, said that air and sea control were in his hands. But what was the reality? I personally saw four warships anchored in Dachen Island being bombed and damaged through binoculars on Yijiangshan. When the People's Liberation Army Air Force was bombing the most fiercely, Wang Shengming, the commander of the Yijiangshan area, requested support from the Taiwan Air Force, but not even a shadow of a plane was seen." He said: "The rapid increase in the naval power of the People's Liberation Army was also something we did not expect. In the past, we were told that the People's Liberation Army's navy was not worth mentioning and could not launch amphibious landing operations across the sea. However, on the day of the liberation of Yijiangshan Island, the People's Liberation Army's army, navy, and air force coordinated their operations, and the navy attacked us in broad daylight, with countless ships rushing towards Yijiangshan. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek's warships hid without a trace, and the few ships that came out were beaten back by the People's Liberation Army Navy." He said: "Another aspect of my underestimation of the People's Liberation Army's naval power was that we believed that even if the People's Liberation Army attacked Yijiangshan Island, it would only use motorized sailing ships and sailboats like it did when it attacked Zhoushan in the past. Because the island is very dangerous, and we have artillery and various firepower, it is very difficult to land on the beach from the front. But we did not expect that the People's Liberation Army not only has a powerful air force, but also such a powerful navy, and that the landing craft used are all modern."

Ge Tanggu, the captured former intelligence staff officer of the Chiang bandit Yijiangshan Area Headquarters, said: "When Chiang Ching-kuo came to Yijiangshan last year, he told us that Yijiangshan is the gateway to counterattack the mainland, and we must not only defend this gateway, but also go out from this gateway to counterattack the mainland. Therefore, both the 'Yijiangshan Area Headquarters' and the 'Dachen Defense Command' painstakingly strengthened the construction of fortifications and the deployment of artillery and other firepower." He said: "But this could not withstand the powerful attacks of the People's Liberation Army's army, navy, and air force. The fortifications that more than 1,000 people had been building for several years and the weapons and ammunition transported by thousands of machine ships were completely destroyed in just two hours. Under the fierce attacks of the People's Liberation Army's bombs and shells, I saw that our gun barrels were all burned red and bent, and many reinforced concrete fortifications were bombed so that almost no shadow was left. When I came out of the bunker to surrender, the red flag of the People's Liberation Army had already been raised on the high ground."

Liu Wuzhong, the captured former operations group leader of the Chiang bandit Yijiangshan Area Headquarters, said: "Chiang Kai-shek once bragged, saying 'One year of preparation, two years of counterattack, three years of mopping up, and five years of success.' But it has been almost six years since he said this, and he is still trapped on the isolated island of Taiwan. Now Chiang Kai-shek is still dreaming of returning to the mainland to be 'president,' and saying 'Five years of recuperation, five years of national restoration,' and colluding with the United States to carry out various conspiracies. But judging from our experience of losing the battle, these conspiracies are doomed to fail." (Xinhua News Agency)

    在一江山岛战斗中被俘的蒋贼军官
    承认抵挡不住人民解放军的强大攻击
    在一江山岛战斗中被俘的蒋军军官说：我们经过一江山岛战斗的人都认识到这一点：国民党想守住沿海岛屿和台湾是不可能的。
    被俘的原蒋贼突击第四大队大队长王辅弼说，当解放军进行登陆作战的时候，他曾想起蒋贼国防部长俞大维说过的话。他说：“在去年十一月里的一天晚上，俞大维陪同蒋介石的儿子蒋经国和美国顾问等十多人到了一江山，把我们叫到他跟前去。俞大维说：‘一江山是大陈的门户，大陈是台湾的屏障；一江山不保，大陈难守；大陈不保，台湾垂危。’从前我认为一江山岛有坚固的工事和险峻的地势，我们起码能守几十个小时，可是实际上解放军一登岸只不过二个钟头，就把我们一千多兵力消灭了，我本人在当天下午三点多钟就当了俘虏。”
    王辅弼说：“蒋介石为了激励部队士气，说什么制空权、制海权都在他的手里。但事实怎样呢？我曾在一江山用望远镜亲眼看到停泊在大陈岛的四艘军舰被炸毁炸伤了。当解放军空军炸得最猛的时候，一江山地区司令王生明要求台湾空军来支援，但是连飞机的影子也没见。”他说：“解放军海军力量的迅速增强，也是我们料想不到的。过去上面对我们说，解放军的海军不足道，不可能发起渡海的两栖登陆作战。但是解放一江山岛那天，解放军陆海空军协同作战，海军在大白天就攻击我们，无数舰艇直扑一江山。当时蒋介石的军舰躲得不见影子，出来的几只舰艇都被解放军海军打了回去。”他说：“我对解放军海军力量估计不足的另一面，是我们认为即使解放军打一江山岛，也不过是用像过去打舟山时的机帆船和风船。因为岛子很险要，而且我们有炮火和各种火力，想从正面登上滩头是很困难的。但我们没有想到解放军不仅有强大的空军，并且有这样强大的海军，用来登陆的都是现代化的登陆艇。”
    被俘的原蒋贼一江山地区司令部情报参谋葛覃谷说：“去年蒋经国到一江山时曾经对我们说，一江山是反攻大陆的大门，我们不仅要守住这扇大门，而且要从这门里出去反攻大陆。因此‘一江山地区司令部’和‘大陈防卫部’都苦心孤诣地加强工事的构筑，加强炮火等等火力的配备。”他说：“可是这抵挡不了解放军陆海空军的强大攻击。一千多人几年来不断构筑的工事和数以千计的机船运来的武器弹药，在短短的二个小时以内，就被彻底摧毁了。在解放军的炸弹和炮弹的猛击下，我看见我们的炮身都被烧得通红弯曲了，许多钢骨水泥工事被炸得几乎连影子也没有了。当我从碉堡里出来投降时，高地上已经竖起了解放军的红旗。”
    被俘的原蒋贼一江山地区司令部作战组长刘五中说：“蒋介石曾经吹牛，说什么‘一年准备，两年反攻，三年扫荡，五年成功。’可是他说这句话快六年了，还是困在台湾这个孤岛上。现在蒋介石还在梦想回到大陆上来做‘总统’，又说什么‘五年生聚，五年复国’，和美国勾结起来进行种种阴谋活动。但是单从我们打败仗的经验来看，这些阴谋也都是要失败的。”（新华社）
