Xinhua News Agency, February 1st: New York dispatch: The United Nations Security Council met at the United Nations Headquarters on January 31st.

As previously reported, the Soviet delegation requested the Security Council to discuss the issue of American acts of aggression against the People’s Republic of China in the Taiwan and other island areas of China, and submitted a corresponding draft resolution. This draft resolution proposes that the Security Council condemn the American acts of aggression against the People’s Republic of China; recommends that the American government immediately take steps to end the aforementioned acts of aggression and its interference in China's internal affairs, and withdraw all American land, sea, and air forces from Taiwan Island and all other territories belonging to China; and appeals to all parties to prevent military actions in the Taiwan area to facilitate the withdrawal of all armed forces not belonging to the People's Republic of China from the islands in that area.

The New Zealand delegation, with the support of the American and British representatives, submitted "the issue of hostile actions in certain island areas along the coast of mainland China" to the Security Council for discussion.

After the President of the Security Council, Mr. Munro (representative of New Zealand), announced the opening of the meeting, the Soviet representative, Mr. Sobolev, immediately stated that the Soviet delegation did not recognize the representation of the Kuomintang clique and requested the Security Council to expel the Kuomintang representative and prevent him from participating in the Security Council's discussion of the important issues to be examined. Mr. Sobolev pointed out that only the representative of the People's Republic of China could represent China.

However, under the manipulation of the United States, the Security Council passed a proposal put forward by the American representative by a vote of ten to one (Soviet Union), stipulating that the Security Council would not discuss any proposals to exclude the Kuomintang representative or accept the representative of the People's Republic of China.

Subsequently, the Security Council entered into a discussion on the provisional agenda.

The Soviet representative, Mr. Sobolev, spoke to explain the reasons for the Soviet government's proposal to include the issue of "the acts of aggression by the United States of America against the People’s Republic of China in the Taiwan and other island areas of China" on the agenda of the Security Council. (Full text to be released separately)

Mr. Sobolev also suggested inviting representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend the Security Council meeting for the discussion of the above issues.

The Security Council voted nine to one (Soviet Union) to include the New Zealand proposal of "the issue of hostile actions in certain island areas along the coast of mainland China" on the agenda. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique abstained.

The Security Council then voted ten to one to include the Soviet proposal of "the acts of aggression by the United States of America against the People’s Republic of China in the Taiwan and other island areas of China" on the agenda. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique voted against.

The Soviet representative suggested that the Council should first discuss the issue raised by the Soviet Union. However, this suggestion was rejected by a majority vote under the manipulation of the United States.

The Security Council then passed a British proposal by a majority vote, stipulating that the issue raised by New Zealand should be discussed first, followed by the issue raised by the Soviet Union. The Soviet representative voted against this suggestion.

The New Zealand representative, Mr. Munro, suggested inviting representatives of the People’s Republic of China to participate in the Security Council's discussion of "the issue of hostile actions in certain island areas along the coast of mainland China". The Security Council passed this suggestion by a majority of nine votes. The Soviet representative abstained in the vote. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique voted against it.

The Security Council meeting then adjourned.

Xinhua News Agency, February 1st: TASS, New York, January 31st: A.A. Sobolev, Deputy Permanent Representative of the Soviet Union to the United Nations Security Council, sent a letter and a draft resolution to the President of the Security Council, Mr. Munro. The letter is as follows:

"Dear Mr. President,

I have the honor to submit to you the Soviet delegation's draft resolution on inviting representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to attend the Security Council meeting to participate in the discussion of the issue of 'the acts of aggression by the United States of America against the People’s Republic of China in the Taiwan and other island areas of China'.

I request you, Mr. President, to distribute this draft resolution as an official document of the Security Council.

Respectfully yours, A.A. Sobolev
        Deputy Permanent Representative of the Soviet Union to the Security Council"

The draft resolution is as follows:

"The Security Council decides to invite representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China to attend the Security Council meeting to participate in the discussion of 'the acts of aggression by the United States of America against the People’s Republic of China in the Taiwan and other island areas of China'."

    关于美国对中国的侵略行为问题
    苏联提案列入安理会议程
    【新华社一日讯】纽约消息：联合国安全理事会一月三十一日在联合国总部开会。
    前已报道，苏联代表团已要求安全理事会讨论关于美国在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为问题，并提出一项相应的决议草案。这个决议草案建议安全理事会谴责美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为；建议美国政府立即采取步骤，以终止上述侵略行为和它对中国内政的干涉，从台湾岛和属于中国的其他一切领土撤退美国的一切陆、海、空军部队；吁请任何一方防止在台湾地区的军事行动以便于不属于中华人民共和国的一切武装部队从那个地区的岛屿撤退。
    新西兰代表团在美国和英国代表的支持下，把“关于在中国大陆沿海某些岛屿地区的敌对行动问题”提交安全理事会讨论。
    在安全理事会主席孟罗（新西兰代表）宣布开会以后，苏联代表索波列夫立即发言说，苏联代表团不承认国民党集团代表的代表权，并且要求安全理事会驱逐国民党代表，不许他参加安全理事会关于将要审理的重要问题的讨论。索波列夫指出，只有中华人民共和国代表才能代表中国。
    但是，安全理事会竟在美国操纵下以十票对一票（苏联）通过了美国代表提出的一项提案，规定安全理事会不讨论关于排斥国民党代表或接纳中华人民共和国代表的任何建议。
    接着，安全理事会进入关于初步议程问题的讨论。
    苏联代表索波列夫发言，解释了苏联政府建议把“关于美利坚合众国在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为”这个问题列入安全理事会议程的理由。（全文另发）
    索波列夫并且建议邀请中华人民共和国代表出席安全理事会会议关于上述问题的讨论。
    安全理事会以九票对一票（苏联）通过把新西兰提出的“关于在中国大陆沿海某些岛屿地区的敌对行动问题”列入议程，蒋介石卖国集团弃权。
    安全理事会接着以十票对一票通过把苏联提出的“关于美利坚合众国在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为”这个问题列入议程。投票反对的是蒋介石卖国集团。
    苏联代表建议理事会首先讨论苏联提出的问题。但是，这个建议在美国操纵下为多数票所否决。
    安全理事会接着以多数票通过了英国的建议，规定首先讨论新西兰提出的问题，然后再讨论苏联提出的问题。苏联代表投票反对这个建议。
    新西兰代表孟罗建议邀请中华人民共和国代表参加安全理事会“关于在中国大陆沿海某些岛屿地区的敌对行动问题”的讨论。安全理事会以九票多数通过了这个建议。苏联代表在投票时弃权。蒋介石卖国集团投票反对。
    安全理事会会议至此休会。
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社纽约一月三十一日讯：苏联常驻联合国安全理事会副代表阿·亚·索波列夫送给安全理事会主席孟罗一封信和一个决议草案。信件如下：
  “亲爱的主席先生：
