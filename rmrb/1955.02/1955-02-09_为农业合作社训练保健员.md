    Training Health Workers for Agricultural Cooperatives
    The Zhejiang Provincial health administration departments have trained a large number of health workers who do not separate from production for state-owned farms and agricultural production cooperatives. Currently, 444 health workers have returned to work in various farms and agricultural production cooperatives. The training of health workers is conducted on a county and district basis. After a short period of training, they generally achieve excellent results. For example, in the first phase of health worker training in Jinhua County, 85% of the 149 trainees achieved excellent grades. After returning to the farms and agricultural production cooperatives, the health workers, in addition to establishing mass health organizations, carrying out patriotic health campaigns, and promoting new methods of midwifery, also carried out first-aid treatment for common field injuries and illnesses. For example, a member of the Baihua Agricultural Production Cooperative in Caozhuang Township, Jiaxing, injured his foot with a hoe during the autumn planting season last year, and the bleeding would not stop. Zhu Wenying, the health worker in the cooperative, immediately disinfected and bandaged the wound, and it healed after a few days. The health worker of the Shengli Agricultural Production Cooperative in Shanhe Township, Xiaoshan County, initiated sanitation and fertilizer sourcing, digging thousand-jin pits and dumping the garbage from the cooperative's usual cleaning activities into the pits to accumulate soil fertilizer. Many areas have already achieved separate pond water usage and established well protection covenants to maintain drinking water hygiene. (Reported by our Zhejiang reporter station)

    为农业合作社训练保健员
    浙江省卫生行政部门为国营农场和农业生产合作社训练了大批不脱离生产的保健员。现已有四百四十四名保健员返回各农场和农业生产合作社工作。保健员的训练是以县区为单位进行的。他们经过短期的训练后，一般成绩优良。如金华县第一期保健员训练班一百四十九名学员中，百分之八十五的学员获得了优等成绩。保健员回到农场、农业生产合作社后，除了建立群众性的卫生组织、开展爱国卫生运动、宣传新法接生等外，还进行了田间一般外伤、疾病的急救治疗工作。如嘉兴曹庄乡百花农业生产合作社有一个社员在去年秋种中锄伤了脚，流血不止，社里保健员朱文英立即进行消毒包扎，几天后伤口痊愈。萧山县山河乡胜利农业生产合作社保健员发起搞卫生、找肥源，挖了千斤坑，将平时社里大扫除的垃圾倒在坑中积土肥。不少地区已做到分塘用水和订立护井公约，保持饮水卫生。　（本报浙江记者站）
