Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Should Not "Go Far Afield" for Production Materials
Zhang Yuebin

    In the past, the Zhangjiakou Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in its work of supplying production materials, "went far afield" to organize sources of goods, resulting in high prices, out-of-season items, and items unsuitable for farmers' needs, leading to forced allocations and stockpiling. In 1954, adhering to the principle of "local sourcing, local supply," it vigorously developed local sources of goods, truly achieving "low prices, timeliness, and popularity with farmers." In 1954, the total value of production materials supplied to farmers by the cooperative throughout the special district exceeded any previous year, an increase of 79 percent compared to 1953. Except for commodity fertilizers, which were slightly insufficient in some counties, these production materials were supplied in a timely manner, meeting the needs.

    One of the characteristics of managing production materials is: high locality. The specifications required in the same region are diverse. For example, regarding fertilizers, farmers generally prefer sesame cake to bean cake; and for sesame cake, they prefer cooked sesame cake processed by local oil mills. Old-style farm tools have even greater locality. Take the iron shovel as an example: farmers in all sixteen counties of the special district use ten different styles, including wide, narrow, long, short, curved, and straight. Farmers in Yu County use three types of hoes. Farmers in the seventh district of Yu County use different types of iron shovels for low-lying land and sloping land. On the basis of existing production technology, old-style farm tools still account for a large proportion. To meet these requirements in agricultural areas and satisfy these needs of farmers is not a simple matter. However, this difficulty is by no means insurmountable.

    Why is it that in the past, on the one hand, there was a lot of stockpiling of production materials, and on the other hand, farmers' needs could not be met? The main reason is being overly ambitious, going far afield, and failing to develop local sources of goods well.

    How to develop local sources of goods? The most important thing is to strengthen the combination with handicraft production cooperatives, link production and sales through internal material exchange meetings, and give play to the role of local handicraft production cooperatives in serving agricultural production. In 1954, cooperatives at all levels throughout the special district held 83 material exchange meetings with the participation of handicraft production cooperatives and handicraftsmen. At these meetings, the supply and marketing cooperatives, according to the different requirements of farmers in different regions, signed more than 600 production and sales combination contracts with handicraft cooperatives and handicraftsmen, stipulating the production and sales of more than 500,000 pieces of agricultural tools. In this way, the supply and marketing cooperatives' source of goods was enriched to meet the needs of farmers, and the handicraft production cooperatives were helped to eliminate the "off-season" of business and improve their operations. After signing a production and sales combination contract, the Chaigoubu Iron Industry Production Cooperative in Huai'an County obtained raw materials at a low price from the supply and marketing cooperative and strengthened the planning of production, so that the "off-season" production plan was overfulfilled by 25 percent; production efficiency was also significantly improved, from 27 sickles produced per furnace to more than 40.

    When strengthening ties with handicraft production cooperatives, the supply and marketing cooperatives also paid attention to absorbing farmers' participation, listening to farmers' criticisms, improving the specifications and quality of products, and also improving the operating enthusiasm of the supply and marketing cooperatives. Last March, at a material exchange meeting held by the Longguan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the agricultural tools of one iron industry production cooperative were of high quality and conformed to local usage habits, and the agricultural tools purchased from it by farmers accounted for 44 percent of the total number of transactions at the meeting; the agricultural tools of another handicraft cooperative were of low quality, and farmers did not buy a single piece from it. At this meeting, farmers also put forward a request to the supply and marketing cooperative to supply 240,000 jin of fertilizer and 6,500 jin of pesticides. These demands of the farmers prompted the handicraft production cooperatives to actively improve product specifications and improve quality; at the same time, it broke the conservative thinking of the supply and marketing cooperative cadres who believed that "farmers do not need many agricultural tools, and there is no need for cooperatives to do more." The Zhao Chuan and Chengguan supply and marketing cooperatives in this county, which had always been unwilling to manage production materials, also started to manage them in large quantities thereafter.

    In order to reduce operating links, reduce costs, and better meet the needs of farmers, the Zhangjiakou Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative adopted the method of bringing producers and users together. For production materials that farmers need and that are available locally, but whose production is dispersed and not easy to manage in a unified way, the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives organize direct transactions between producers and users. For example, the farmers of Fanshan in Zhuolu County asked the supply and marketing cooperative to supply 100,000 grape trellis poles (for supporting grape vines). These things are sideline products produced by farmers in a scattered way; according to past experience, centralized management cannot well meet the needs of farmers. Therefore, the supply and marketing cooperative mobilized farmers to produce according to needs and organized direct transactions between farmers, which everyone was very satisfied with.

    Production materials that can be managed in a centralized way are purchased directly from producers by the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives. Doing so not only reduces costs, but also meets the needs of the masses. In 1954, agricultural tools sent to farmers by the iron and wood industry production cooperatives throughout the special district through the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives accounted for 70 percent of the total production of the cooperatives.

    In terms of fertilizers, the supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of the special district also developed local fertilizer sources according to the requirements of farmers. Combined with solving the problem of edible oil supply, they organized oil mills to process fertilizers; and they also set up manure plants near basic construction sites to increase the management of miscellaneous fertilizers. These are all very popular with farmers.

    The result of developing local sources of goods is that local production can completely solve local needs. In 1954, more than 90 percent of the old-style farm tools supplied to farmers by the supply and marketing cooperatives throughout the special district were local goods; in addition to the supply of some chemical fertilizers, fertilizers were also entirely from local sources. This avoided many difficulties caused by long-distance allocation and reduced costs. In 1953, more than 200,000 pieces of agricultural tools were managed, but more than 50,000 pieces were stockpiled; the bean cake in Yu County could not be sold and became infested with insects. These phenomena were completely eliminated last year. In the past, the iron shovels managed by Longguan County were mainly purchased from Huailai County; because of the long distance and high price, and sometimes because of transportation problems, the season was missed and they were often stockpiled. After developing local sources of goods, the same iron shovel was 3,000 yuan cheaper than purchasing it from Huailai County.

    Developing local sources of goods also facilitates the timely supply of production materials. From the fourth quarter of 1953, internal material exchange meetings were held at each level to make a comprehensive arrangement for the source of goods for the entire year's production materials. The grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in various places organized 164 oil pressing mills to process fertilizers, and also entrusted handicraft production cooperatives to process agricultural tools. These production materials for spring plowing were completed and prepared according to plan in March (spring plowing in this area has not yet begun), and at the same time, efforts were fully turned to supply. In this way, the supply of production materials for spring plowing in 1954 was one month earlier than in 1953. Farmers generally reflected that the fertilizers and agricultural tools of the supply and marketing cooperatives in 1954 were satisfactory, timely, and cheap.

    供销合作社经营生产资料不可“舍近求远”
    张悦斌
    张家口专区供销合作社在生产资料供应工作中，过去因组织货源“舍近求远”，价高、过季、不适合农民需要，以致发生强拨硬塞、最后积压的现象。一九五四年，本着“就地取材，就地供应”的方针，大力开辟了地方货源，真正作到了“价廉、及时、农民喜用”。一九五四年，全专区供销社供应农民的生产资料总值，超过了已往任何一年，比一九五三年增加了百分之七十九。这些生产资料，除去商品肥料在部分县略感不足外，都作到了适时供应、满足需要。
    经营生产资料的特点之一是：地方性大，同一个地区要求的规格是多种多样的。比如肥料，一般农民愿意要麻饼，不喜欢用豆饼；而对于麻饼又喜欢用当地油坊加工的熟麻饼。旧式农具的地方性更大，拿铁锨一种来说，全专区十六个县的农民就使用宽、窄、长、短、弯、直等十种不同样式。蔚县农民使用的锄头就有三种。蔚县七区农民使用的铁锨，就有洼地锨和坡地锨之分。在现有生产技术的基础上，旧式农具还占很大比重。要适合农区这些要求，满足农民的这些要求，就不是简单的事。但是，这种困难也决不是不可克服的。
    为什么以前生产资料一方面有许多积压、另方面又不能满足农民的要求呢？主要原因是好高骛远、舍近求远，没有很好地开辟地方货源。
    怎样开辟地方货源呢？最重要的是加强同手工业生产合作社的结合，通过内部物资交流会，把产、销挂起钩来，发挥当地手工业生产合作社为农业生产服务的作用。一九五四年，全专区各级社召开了有手工业生产社和手工业者参加的物资交流会八十三次。在这些会上，供销合作社根据不同地区农民的不同要求，同手工业社和手工业者分别订立产销结合合同六百多份，规定产销的农具有五十多万件。这样，既充实了供销合作社的货源，去满足农民的需要，又帮助手工业生产社消除了业务“淡季”，改善了经营。怀安县柴沟堡铁业生产合作社在订立产销结合合同以后，取得供销社廉价供应的原料，加强了生产计划性，使青黄不接时的“淡季”生产计划超额完成了百分之二十五；生产效率也显著地提高了，由每盘炉生产镰刀二十七张提高到四十多张。
    供销社同手工业生产社加强联系时，还注意了吸收农民参加，听取农民的批评意见，改进了产品的规格质量，同时也提高了供销社的经营积极性。去年三月，在龙关县供销社召开的物资交流会上，一个铁业生产合作社的农具质量高，又合乎当地使用习惯，农民向它买去的农具占会议成交总数的百分之四十四；另一个手工业社的农具质量低，农民一件也没向它买。在这次会上，农民还向供销社提出供应肥料二十四万斤、农药六千五百斤的要求。农民这些要求，促使了手工业生产合作社积极改良产品规格，提高质量；同时打破了供销社干部认为“农民需要的农具不多，用不着合作社多办”的保守思想。这个县的赵川、城关两个供销社，向来不愿意经营生产资料，此后也大量经营起来了。
    为了减少经营环节，降低成本，更好地满足农民的需要，张家口专区供销社采取了生产者和使用者见面的办法。农民需要，当地有货源，而生产分散不易统一经营的生产资料，由基层供销社组织生产者和使用者直接交易。如涿鹿县矾山农民提出让供销社供应葡萄架杆（架葡萄树用）十万根。这些东西是农民分散生产的副业产品；根据已往的经验，集中经营，不能很好地满足农民需要。因此，供销社就按照需要发动农民生产，组织农民直接交易，大家都很满意。
    能够集中经营的生产资料，由基层供销社直接向生产者进货。这样作，不但能降低成本，而且能适合群众需要。一九五四年，全专区铁、木业生产合作社通过基层供销社送到农民手里的农具，占各社生产总数的百分之七十。
    在肥料方面，专区各地供销社也按照农民的要求，开辟了地方肥源。他们结合着解决食油供应问题，组织油坊加工；并且在基本建设工地附近设立粪厂，增加杂肥的经营。这些都很受农民欢迎。
    开辟地方货源的结果，完全可以用地方的生产，解决地方的需要。一九五四年，全专区供销社供应农民的旧式农具，百分之九十以上是本地货；肥料除供应了部分化学肥料外，也完全是利用当地货源。这就避免了因长途调拨所引起的许多困难，降低了成本。一九五三年，共经营农具二十万件，就积压了五万多件；蔚县的豆饼卖不了，生了虫。这些现象，在去年完全消灭了。龙关县过去经营的铁锨，主要是从怀来县进货；因为路程远，价格高，有时还因运输的问题，误了季节，常常积压。开辟地方货源以后，同样的一张铁锨，要比从怀来县进货便宜三千元。
    开辟地方货源，也便于使生产资料的供应及时。从一九五三年第四季，就逐级召开内部物资交流会，把全年生产资料的货源，作了全面安排。各地基层供销社，组织了一百六十四座榨油坊，进行肥料加工，还委托手工业生产社进行农具加工。这些春耕用的生产资料，在三月份就按计划完成了准备工作（这个地区春耕尚未开始），同时全力转向供应。这样一九五四年春耕生产资料的供应工作就比一九五三年提前了一个月。农民普遍反映：一九五四年供销社的肥料、农具，合心，及时，价格便宜。
