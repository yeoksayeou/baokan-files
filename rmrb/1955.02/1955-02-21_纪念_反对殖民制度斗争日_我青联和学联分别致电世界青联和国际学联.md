Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: To commemorate "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism", the All-China Federation of Democratic Youth sent a telegram to the World Federation of Democratic Youth on the 19th. The telegram reads as follows: To the World Federation of Democratic Youth and to the young friends of colonial and oppressed countries:

    On the occasion of February 21st, the World Youth "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism", Chinese youth extend brotherly greetings to the World Federation of Democratic Youth and all youth who are striving for national independence and opposing colonialism. The World Federation of Democratic Youth has been enthusiastically supporting the just struggle of the youth of colonial and oppressed countries and has made great contributions in this regard. The Chinese youth, who have defeated imperialism through a long and arduous struggle, deeply sympathize with the plight of the youth of colonial and oppressed countries under the yoke of colonialism, and firmly support their heroic struggle for peace, national independence and vital rights.

    At present, the American aggressor group and its followers are intensifying international tensions, stepping up the enslavement of the people and youth of colonial and oppressed countries, and using the preparation of atomic warfare to intimidate the peace-loving people of the world, attempting to realize its sinister plot to enslave all peoples of the world. Chinese youth are closely united to fight for the defense of peace, against aggression, and against the threat of atomic war.

    We are deeply convinced that the just struggle of the people and youth of colonial and oppressed countries will win the final victory, and we wish the youth of these countries greater success in their struggle for peace, independence and vital rights.
Xinhua News Agency, February 20th: To commemorate "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism", the All-China Students' Federation sent a telegram to the International Union of Students on the 19th. The telegram reads as follows: To the International Union of Students and to the students of all colonial and oppressed countries:

    On the occasion of February 21st, "Day of Struggle Against Colonialism", Chinese students extend warm greetings to the International Union of Students and all students who are striving for national independence and opposing colonialism. In recent years, the International Union of Students has consistently supported the just struggle of students in colonial and oppressed countries and has made great efforts to strengthen the unity of students in colonial and oppressed countries and to strive for the realization of their daily vital demands. The liberated Chinese students deeply care about and sympathize with the suffering of students in various colonial and oppressed countries, and warmly support their heroic struggle together with the people of their own countries for peace, national independence and the defense of vital rights.

    At present, the American aggressor group is intensifying international tensions and attempting to launch an atomic war to realize its plot to dominate the world, and is stepping up the enslavement of the people of colonial and oppressed countries. Facts have proved that the American aggressor group is the most ferocious enemy of the people of colonial and oppressed countries. Chinese students will always stand together with the students of all colonial and oppressed countries and carry out a resolute struggle against imperialist aggression, against colonialism, and for the maintenance of world peace.

    纪念“反对殖民制度斗争日”
    我青联和学联分别致电世界青联和国际学联
  【新华社二十日讯】为纪念“反对殖民制度斗争日”，中华全国民主青年联合会十九日致电世界民主青年联盟，电文如下：世界民主青年联盟并转殖民地被压迫国家的青年朋友：
    值此二月二十一日——世界青年“反对殖民制度斗争日”，中国青年向世界民主青年联盟及一切争取民族独立、反对殖民制度的青年致以兄弟的敬礼。世界民主青年联盟一直热情地支援着殖民地被压迫国家的青年的正义斗争，并在这方面作了巨大贡献。经过长期艰苦斗争而战胜了帝国主义的中国青年，深切同情殖民地被压迫国家的青年在殖民制度桎梏下的处境，并坚决支持他们为和平、民族独立和切身权利而进行的英勇斗争。
    目前，美国侵略集团及其追随者正在加剧国际紧张局势，加紧奴役殖民地被压迫国家的人民和青年，并以准备原子战争来恫吓世界爱好和平的人民，企图借此实现它奴役全世界各族人民的罪恶阴谋。中国青年紧密团结，为保卫和平、反对侵略、反对原子战争威胁而斗争。
    我们深信：殖民地被压迫国家的人民和青年的正义斗争必将获得最后的胜利，并祝这些国家的青年在争取和平、独立和切身权利的斗争中取得更大的成就。
    【新华社二十日讯】为纪念“反对殖民制度斗争日”，中华全国学生联合会十九日打电报给国际学生联合会，电文如下：国际学生联合会并转各殖民地被压迫国家学生：
    值此二月二十一日“反对殖民制度斗争日”，中国学生向国际学生联合会及一切争取民族独立、反对殖民制度的学生致以热烈的敬礼。几年来国际学生联合会始终如一地支持着殖民地被压迫国家学生的正义斗争，并为加强殖民地被压迫国家学生的团结、争取实现他们日常的切身要求而作了巨大的努力。解放了的中国学生深切关怀与同情各殖民地被压迫国家学生的痛苦处境，并热烈支持他们和本国人民一起为争取和平、民族独立与保卫切身权利而进行的英勇斗争。
    目前美国侵略集团正在加剧国际紧张局势，并企图发动原子战争以实现独霸世界的阴谋，加紧奴役殖民地被压迫国家人民。事实证明，美国侵略集团是殖民地被压迫国家人民最凶恶的敌人。中国学生将永远和一切殖民地被压迫国家的学生站在一起，为反对帝国主义侵略、反对殖民主义、维护全世界和平而进行坚决的斗争。
