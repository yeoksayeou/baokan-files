Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 14th: On February 12, 1955, N.A. Bulganin spoke with American journalists W.L. Hearst, Kingsbury Smith, and F. Conniff. The record of the conversation is as follows:

Kingsbury Smith said that he and his companions were very grateful for the opportunity to meet and talk with the leaders of the Soviet government and prominent Soviet cultural figures. They especially expressed their deep gratitude to N.A. Bulganin for being able to receive them. They received the notification that they could be received at the Leningrad airport.

Kingsbury Smith continued that Hearst and his companions, while attending the Supreme Soviet session, had noted V.M. Molotov's statement that the Soviet Union had now left the United States behind in the manufacture of hydrogen weapons. They also noted that Soviet leaders, in their conversations with them and at the Supreme Soviet session, had stated that the Soviet government hoped to end the arms race. The three of them knew what the scientific community, especially in the West, thought about the threat to mankind posed by the continued unrestricted testing of atomic weapons. Therefore, Hearst wanted to make a suggestion.

N.A. Bulganin said that he would be very interested to hear what Hearst had to say.

Hearst thanked N.A. Bulganin and expressed his belief that the US government and the American people were equally committed to seeking the peace that the Soviet government had spoken of.

Because the experimental explosions of thermonuclear weapons are a threat to all mankind, he, Hearst, wanted to ask whether the Soviet government was prepared to conclude an agreement with the United States and other Western countries to limit the number of experimental explosions before atomic weapons were banned. This agreement would not require the establishment of a monitoring system, because any violation of this agreement would be immediately known to the other party.

In his, Hearst's, opinion, this may be the only way to begin disarmament in the field of atomic weapons.

N.A. Bulganin replied that a more fundamental approach must be taken on this issue, namely the approach proposed by the Soviet government. The Soviet government has proposed the complete prohibition of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other types of weapons of mass destruction, the cessation of production of these types of weapons, and the destruction of these weapons that have already been produced from the armaments of all countries.

The suggestion to limit testing would, in practice, be of no use. People all over the world know that both sides have bombs that have already been manufactured and successfully tested in their warehouses. Therefore, an agreement to limit experimental explosions cannot reassure anyone. Some would say that the question of stopping future experimental explosions is now being raised because a large number of weapons of mass destruction have already been accumulated. This is not reassuring.

The Soviet government has in the past and now proposes a more fundamental approach. It proposes to ban the production, stockpiling, and use of weapons of mass destruction. Work must be done in this direction and an agreement must be reached.

Kingsbury Smith said that he wanted to clarify Hearst's suggestion. It is not a matter of completely banning such experimental explosions, but of limiting the number of such explosions. Perhaps the Soviet Union, and the United States as well, do not now intend to completely stop experimental explosions. However, considering the warning from scientists that unlimited explosions are a threat, does the Soviet Union believe that it could, on the basis of an agreement with Western countries, limit the number of experimental explosions to five, ten, or fifteen per year as a first step towards the final prohibition of weapons of mass destruction? If the Soviet government is unwilling to do so, it may cause some disappointment in public opinion.

N.A. Bulganin replied that the Soviet Union is prepared to consider any suggestion aimed at eliminating the danger of the use of weapons of mass destruction, as long as these suggestions are genuinely motivated by such an aim.

Hearst said that he had spoken with his New York office the previous evening, and they told him that N.A. Bulganin's and V.M. Molotov's speeches at the Supreme Soviet session were considered a veiled attack on the US government, and had therefore aroused various speculations in the United States: did the change in the Soviet government's leadership mean that the Soviet government intended to adopt a more hostile attitude towards the United States.

Speaking of this, he, Hearst, wanted to ask whether N.A. Bulganin believed that the change of leadership meant a change in the Soviet attitude towards the United States.

N.A. Bulganin replied: No, that is not the meaning.

Hearst and Kingsbury Smith noted that they were very pleased to hear this.

Conniff said that N.S. Khrushchev said in his conversation with them last week that it was wrong to incite American public opinion against the Soviet Union and to try to create the impression that the Soviet Union wanted war. However, V.M. Molotov's speech at the Supreme Soviet session could create the impression that the American side wanted war. The American people inevitably believe that it is also wrong to try to create this impression.

In this regard, does N.A. Bulganin believe that it would be beneficial to consolidate peace if Soviet officials abandoned attacks on the United States and American officials abandoned attacks on the Soviet Union?

N.A. Bulganin replied that he thought it would be beneficial. As for V.M. Molotov's report mentioned by Conniff, this report is a completely objective assessment of the facts, and only of the facts, and it fully reflects the views of the Soviet government.

Kingsbury Smith pointed out that Molotov's speech repeatedly mentioned the US government's aggressive intentions and gave the impression that the United States was preparing for war. However, the American people believe that their government has no aggressive intentions. The American people know that President Eisenhower has given up taking actions in the Indochina region and in the Formosa (Taiwan) region that could lead to expanded conflict. When Americans read such statements by Soviet officials, they get the impression that the Soviet government either has an incorrect idea of the US government's attitude, or deliberately wants to turn other countries against the United States. This naturally increases the anxiety of the American people, and makes them more convinced that the United States should have military bases.

He, Kingsbury Smith, stated that Soviet officials, in their conversations with them and in their speeches at the Supreme Soviet session, had assured that the Soviet government hoped to improve relations with the United States. He did not quite understand how the aforementioned attacks on the US government could be reconciled with these assurances from Soviet officials.

N.A. Bulganin replied that the assurances of Soviet representatives regarding their hope to establish good and normal relations with the US government are completely sincere. He pointed out in his speech at the Supreme Soviet session that during the war, the Soviet Union and the United States, Britain, and later France, which joined the alliance, had good mutual relations. The Soviet Union would be very satisfied if such relations could be restored now. V.M. Molotov and he, Bulganin, both stated in their speeches at the Supreme Soviet session that the Soviet government hoped to promote the easing of the current overall tense situation. The Soviet government sincerely hopes this, and he, Bulganin, expects that the people of all countries in the world also hope this.

Mr. Kingsbury Smith said that V.M. Molotov's report aroused certain emotions in the United States, but these emotions were caused by incorrect reports of the report. Some people intentionally made incorrect reports of the report in order to justify the establishment of US military bases around the Soviet Union and near its borders, and, as everyone knows, these military bases were established long before Molotov and Bulganin spoke. The establishment of these military bases has nothing to do with what the Soviet leaders said.

Kingsbury Smith thanked N.A. Bulganin for the explanation.

Hearst said that today, February 12, is the birthday of one of the great political leaders of the American people, and also one of the spiritual leaders of the American people—Abraham Lincoln. In his Gettysburg Address, Lincoln said that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

Hearst asked if Bulganin would like to comment on Lincoln's words.

Bulganin replied that it was a good sentence, the wise words of a great man.

Hearst asked if Bulganin had known this sentence before.

Bulganin answered in the negative.

Kingsbury Smith requested permission to ask a question about the situation of the Soviet state administration. He and his companions did not quite understand when and at what level the decision to allow Malenkov to resign and to appoint Bulganin as the new premier was first taken, and then submitted this decision to the Supreme Soviet. Whether it is correct to say that this decision was first made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and then submitted to the Supreme Soviet for deliberation.

Bulganin replied that the suggestion to appoint a new chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, as reported in the newspapers, was submitted to the Supreme Soviet for deliberation by Khrushchev, representing the meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the heads of the delegations of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. In our country, there is an alliance between communists and non-communists.

Kingsbury Smith asked whether it is correct to say that the manner of Malenkov's resignation and Bulganin's appointment as the new premier meant maintaining the principle of collective leadership.

Bulganin replied that, without a doubt, our principle of collective leadership is unshakable.

Kingsbury Smith said that, according to newspaper reports, it was unclear whether G.M. Malenkov was still a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU, and asked if he was.

N.A. Bulganin gave an affirmative answer.

Conniff said that the view that the ultimate goal of the Soviet government is to establish communist rule throughout the world is still very popular in the West. Conniff asked N.A. Bulganin for his opinion on this point.

N.A. Bulganin replied that Hearst, Kingsbury Smith, and Conniff had already exchanged views extensively with N.S. Khrushchev on this issue, and Khrushchev had given a detailed and exhaustive answer to the question raised by Conniff. This answer has been published in the newspapers. He, Bulganin, has nothing more to add to N.S. Khrushchev's opinion.

Conniff thanked N.A. Bulganin for his answer. And then he continued that the change of leadership in the Soviet government inevitably caused many speculations in the West. Some people believe that since Marshal Bulganin is now the Premier and Marshal Zhukov is the Minister of Defense, the military influence on Soviet policy may be strengthened.

Conniff asked N.A. Bulganin if the Soviet government is now prepared to rely more on the experience of military leaders in implementing its policies.

N.A. Bulganin replied that he, Bulganin, had already explained the policies of the Soviet government in great detail in his speech at the Supreme Soviet session, and he believed that a detailed answer to Conniff's question could be found in this speech.

Kingsbury Smith said that it is widely believed in the West that the key to lasting peace lies in disarmament, and the key to disarmament lies in establishing an effective international monitoring system for all types of weapons, including atomic weapons, and establishing permanent monitoring.

Kingsbury Smith asked N.A. Bulganin to answer how he assessed the possibility of reaching such an agreement.

N.A. Bulganin replied that the Soviet government had already made suggestions on this issue. The Soviet government advocates disarmament and advocates prohibiting the use, manufacture and storage of atomic weapons. The Soviet government also advocates supervision. The Soviet Union has made suggestions on these issues in a number of documents, which are still under discussion in the relevant international bodies.

Conniff said that when Hearst and his companions spoke to their New York office, they were reminded that the strong tone taken at the Supreme Soviet session had caused serious unease in the United States. He, Conniff, wanted to ask if there was anything they, as journalists, could do to alleviate this unease.

N.A. Bulganin replied that Hearst, Kingsbury Smith, and Conniff can report through newspapers or other methods they deem appropriate that the Soviet government sincerely hopes to ease international tensions, hopes to maintain peace among the peoples of all countries, and hopes to improve relations with the United States. It would be beneficial to accurately convey and objectively explain what they have seen and heard in the Soviet Union, because journalists, especially the journalists he, Bulganin, is talking to today, have a great influence.

Hearst pointed out that he is a representative of the second generation of journalists, and therefore fully aware of the responsibilities borne by journalists.

Conniff asked permission to ask a typical American question, which is about N.A. Bulganin personally. He asked if N.A. Bulganin objected to asking such questions.

N.A. Bulganin replied that it depended on what the questions were.

Conniff asked how N.A. Bulganin felt when he was entrusted with the great responsibility of leading a large country like the Soviet Union, and what his personal reaction was when he learned of the new appointment.

N.A. Bulganin replied that his feelings were the same as people's feelings in such circumstances.

Kingsbury Smith expressed deep gratitude to N.A. Bulganin for taking the time to meet with them and answer their questions.

Hearst said that he and his companions had been given a rare opportunity, namely, to meet and talk with not one or two, but four outstanding Soviet leaders. He, Hearst, believes that these intelligent people with good wishes and pursuing peaceful aims, whom he had the opportunity to meet in Moscow, should find and will definitely find a path to peace.

N.A. Bulganin expressed his thanks for Hearst's words.

Kingsbury Smith finally said that Hearst would meet with Churchill in London on Monday. He asked if N.A. Bulganin had anything to convey to Churchill informally.

Kingsbury Smith mentioned this, saying that nothing of what N.A. Bulganin might say would be published in the newspapers.

N.A. Bulganin replied that he had nothing to convey.

    布尔加宁同美国记者谈话
   【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十四日电：一九五五年二月十二日尼·亚·布尔加宁同美国记者威·伦·赫斯特、金斯伯里·史密斯和佛·康尼夫谈话，记录如下：
    金斯伯里·史密斯说，他和他的同伴能得到机会和苏联政府领导人以及杰出的苏联文化工作者会面和谈话，非常感激。他们特别向尼·亚·布尔加宁表示深切的感谢，感谢他能够接见他们。他们是在列宁格勒飞机场上接到可以接见他们的通知的。
    金斯伯里·史密斯继续说，赫斯特和他的同伴在列席最高苏维埃会议时，曾注意到维·米·莫洛托夫的话：现在苏联在氢武器制造方面已使美国落在后面了。他们还注意到，苏联领袖们在同他们谈话中和在最高苏维埃会议上都说到，苏联政府希望终止军备竞赛。他们三个人都知道：关于继续无限制地进行原子武器爆炸试验对人类所产生的威胁，科学界、特别是西方的科学界抱着怎样的看法。因此，赫斯特想提出一个建议。
    尼·亚·布尔加宁说，他将非常感兴趣地倾听赫斯特的话。
    赫斯特感谢尼·亚·布尔加宁，并且表示相信，美国政府和美国人民也同样致力谋求苏联政府所说的和平。
    由于热核子武器的试验性爆炸对全人类是一个威胁，他，赫斯特，想问一问，苏联政府是不是准备在原子武器禁止以前，就和美国及其他西方国家缔结一项限制试验性爆炸次数的协定。这种协定不需要建立监督制度，因为这一协定遭到任何破坏时，另一方马上就会知道的。
    据他，赫斯特，的意见，这可能是着手在原子武器方面裁军的唯一办法。
    尼·亚·布尔加宁回答说，在这个问题上必须采取比较根本的办法，就是苏联政府提出的办法。苏联政府建议彻底禁止原子武器、氢武器和其他类型的大规模毁灭性武器，停止生产这些类型的武器，以及从各国军备中销毁已经生产出来的这些武器。
    限制试验的建议实际上不会有任何用处。全世界人民知道双方仓库中都有了已经制造出来、并且试验成功的炸弹。因此，限制试验性爆炸的协定不能使任何人感到安心。有人会说，关于停止今后进行试验性爆炸的问题现在之所以提出来，是因为已经聚积了很多的大规模毁灭性的武器了。这是不能使人安心的。
    苏联政府过去和现在都提出了比较根本的办法。它建议禁止生产、保藏和使用大规模毁灭性武器。必须向这方面进行工作并取得协议。
    金斯伯里·史密斯说，他想把赫斯特的建议说得更确切一些。不是指完全禁止这种试验性的爆炸，而是指限制这种爆炸的次数。也许苏联、还有美国现在不打算完全停止试验性的爆炸。但是，考虑到科学家提出的、无限制的爆炸是一种威胁这一警告，苏联是否认为可以在同西方国家取得协议的基础上，把试验性爆炸的次数限制为每年五次、十次或十五次，以作为走向最后禁止大规模毁灭性武器的第一步。如果苏联政府不愿这样做，就可能使舆论界感到一些失望。
    尼·亚·布尔加宁回答说，苏联准备考虑任何以消除使用大规模毁灭性武器的危险为目的的建议，只要这些建议是真正地抱着这样的目的。
    赫斯特说，昨日晚间他同他的纽约事务所的人通过话，他们告诉他说，尼·亚·布尔加宁和维·米·莫洛托夫在最高苏维埃会议上的讲话，被认为是对美国政府的含蓄的攻击，因而在美国引起了种种的推测：苏联政府领导的变动是不是意味着，苏联政府打算对美国采取更敌对的态度。
    谈到这里，他，赫斯特，想问一问，尼·亚·布尔加宁是否认为：领导的变换意味着苏联对美国的态度的改变。
    尼·亚·布尔加宁回答说：不，没有这样的意思。
    赫斯特和金斯伯里·史密斯指出，他们很高兴听到这样的话。
    康尼夫说，尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫上周在同他们谈话时说，煽动美国的舆论反对苏联以及企图造成一种苏联要战争的印象，这是不对的。然而从维·米·莫洛托夫在最高苏维埃会议上的讲话中会造成这样的印象：美国方面要战争。美国人民必然认为，企图造成这种印象也是不对的。
    在这方面，尼·亚·布尔加宁是否认为，苏联官方人士放弃对美国的攻击，而美国官方人士放弃对苏联的攻击，会有益于巩固和平呢？
    尼·亚·布尔加宁回答说，他认为，这会是有益的。至于康尼夫所提到的维·米·莫洛托夫的报告，这个报告是对事实、也仅仅是对事实的完全客观的估计，这个报告完全反映了苏联政府的观点。
    金斯伯里·史密斯指出，在莫洛托夫的讲话中不止一次地提到美国政府的侵略意图并且使人觉得，美国在准备战争。然而美国人民相信，他们的政府没有任何侵略意图。美国人民知道，艾森豪威尔总统放弃在印度支那地区以及在福摩萨（台湾）地区采取可能引起扩大冲突的行动。当美国人读到苏联官方人士这种言论的时候，他们会产生这样一种印象；苏联政府不是对美国政府的态度有不正确的概念，就是蓄意要使其他国家反对美国。这自然会增加美国人民的忧虑，并且使他们更加相信，美国应该设有军事基地。
    他，金斯伯里·史密斯表示，苏联官方人士在同他们谈话时以及在最高苏维埃会议发言时，都保证苏联政府希望改善同美国的关系，他不十分明白上述那些对美国政府的攻击和苏联官方人士的这些保证怎么能够没有矛盾。
    尼·亚·布尔加宁回答说，苏联代表们关于希望同美国政府建立良好的、正常的关系的保证是完全真诚的。他在最高苏维埃会议上的演说中指出，在战争期间，苏联和美国、英国、以及后来参加这个同盟的法国曾经有过良好的相互关系，如果现在能够恢复这样的关系，苏联会十分满意的。维·米·莫洛托夫和他，布尔加宁，在最高苏维埃会议上的发言都说到，苏联政府希望促使目前整个紧张局势趋于缓和。苏联政府真诚希望这样，他，布尔加宁，料想世界各国人民也同样希望这样。
    金斯伯里·史密斯先生曾经说，维·米·莫洛托夫的报告引起美国国内某种情绪，然而这些情绪是由于不正确地报道这个报告而引起的，有人为了替美国在苏联周围和靠近它的边界地区建立军事基地辩护，而有意地对这个报告作不正确的报道，而且，大家知道，这些军事基地是远在莫洛托夫和布尔加宁发言之前很久就已经建立了的。这些军事基地的建立和苏联领袖们所说的话是没有任何关联的。
    金斯伯里·史密斯感谢尼·亚·布尔加宁的解释。
    赫斯特说，今天，二月十二日是美国人民伟大的政治领袖之一，也可以说是美国人民的精神领袖之一——亚伯拉罕·林肯的诞辰。林肯在葛底斯堡演说中说，民有、民治、民享的政府是永远也不会消灭的。
    赫斯特问，布尔加宁愿不愿意对林肯这句话作什么评论。
    布尔加宁回答，这是一句很好的话，一个伟大人物的智慧的言语。
    赫斯特问，布尔加宁以前是否知道这句话。
    布尔加宁作了否定的回答。
    金斯伯里·史密斯请求允许他提出一个关于苏维埃国家管理的情况的问题。他和他的同伴不十分明白，什么时候和在那一级上，首先采取允许马林科夫辞职和任命布尔加宁为新的总理的决定，然后把这个决定提交最高苏维埃。如果说，这个决定首先是由苏联共产党中央委员会作出，随后提交最高苏维埃审议，这样说是否正确。
    布尔加宁回答说，关于任命苏联新的部长会议主席的建议，正如报纸上所报道的，是由赫鲁晓夫代表代表苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联最高苏维埃各代表团团长会议提交最高苏维埃审议的。在我们的国家中存在着共产党人同非党人士的联盟。
    金斯伯里·史密斯问，马林科夫辞职的方式和布尔加宁的被任命为新的总理，意味着保持集体领导的原则，这样说是否正确。
    布尔加宁回答，毫无疑问，我们的集体领导的原则是不可动摇的。
    金斯伯里·史密斯说，从报纸上的消息来看，不大清楚格·马·马林科夫是否仍然是苏共中央主席团的委员，并且问道，究竟是不是呢。
    尼·亚·布尔加宁作了肯定的回答。
    康尼夫说，西方还很流行这样的看法，认为苏联政府的最终目的是在全世界建立共产主义势力的统治。康尼夫请尼·亚·布尔加宁对这点表示意见。
    尼·亚·布尔加宁回答说，赫斯特、金斯伯里·史密斯和康尼夫已就这个问题和尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫广泛地交换过意见，赫鲁晓夫已对康尼夫所提出的这个问题作了详尽无遗的回答。报纸上已刊载了这个回答。他，布尔加宁，对尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫的意见不能再有什么补充了。
    康尼夫感谢尼·亚·布尔加宁的回答。并且接着说，苏联政府领导的更换不免引起了西方许许多多的揣测，有人认为既然现在由布尔加宁元帅担任总理，朱可夫元帅担任国防部长，苏联政策所受到的军事影响可能加强。
    康尼夫问尼·亚·布尔加宁说，苏联政府现在是不是准备在执行自己的政策当中更多地依靠军事领导人员的经验。
    尼·亚·布尔加宁回答说，他，布尔加宁，在最高苏维埃会议上所发表的演说中已经十分详细地阐明了苏联政府的政策，他认为，在这个演说中可以找到对康尼夫所提的问题的详尽的答复。
    金斯伯里·史密斯说，西方普遍地认为，持久和平的关键在于裁军，而裁军的关键则是对一切类型的武器，包括原子武器在内，建立有效的国际监督制度，并且建立永久性的监察。
    金斯伯里·史密斯请求尼·亚·布尔加宁回答，他怎样估计达成这种协议的可能性。
    尼·亚·布尔加宁回答，苏联政府已经就这一问题提出建议。苏联政府主张裁军，主张禁止使用、制造和储存原子武器。苏联政府也主张进行监督。苏联已经在一些文件中就这些问题提出了建议，这些文件在有关的国际机构中还在讨论。
    康尼夫说，赫斯特和他的同伴在和他们的纽约的事务所通话的时候，他们被提请注意，最高苏维埃会议上所采取的激烈的语调在美国引起了严重的不安。他，康尼夫，想问一问，他们，作为记者，可以做些什么事情来减轻这种不安的情绪。
    尼·亚·布尔加宁回答，赫斯特、金斯伯里·史密斯和康尼夫可以通过报纸或者他们认为适当的其他方法，报道苏联政府真诚地希望缓和国际紧张局势，希望保持各国人民之间的和平，报道它希望改善同美国的关系。正确地传达和客观地阐明他们在苏联的见闻，将是有益的，因为记者，尤其是他，布尔加宁，今天与之交谈的这些记者，有很大的影响。
    赫斯特指出，他是第二代记者的代表，因而完全意识到记者所负担的责任。
    康尼夫要求准许他提出一个典型的美国式的问题，就是关于尼·亚·布尔加宁个人的问题。他问道，尼·亚·布尔加宁是否反对提这种问题。
    尼·亚·布尔加宁回答说，这要看是什么问题。
    康尼夫问道，当尼·亚·布尔加宁被加予领导像苏联这样一个大国的重大责任时，他有什么感觉，当他知道新的任命时，他个人有什么反应。
    尼·亚·布尔加宁回答说，他的感觉同人们在这种情况下的感觉一样。
    金斯伯里·史密斯表示深深感谢尼·亚·布尔加宁花时间接见他们和回答他们的问题。
    赫斯特说，他和他的同伴得到了很少人有的这样一个机会，这就是并不是同一位或是两位而是同四位苏联杰出的领袖会晤和谈话。他，赫斯特，相信，他有机会在莫斯科会晤到的这些聪明的人、有着善良愿望和追求和平目的的人，应该找到而且绝对会找到通向和平的途径。
    尼·亚·布尔加宁对赫斯特的话表示感谢。
    金斯伯里·史密斯最后说，赫斯特在星期一将在伦敦同邱吉尔会晤。他问道，尼·亚·布尔加宁是不是有什么话要非正式地转达给邱吉尔。
    金斯伯里·史密斯提到这一点时说，尼·亚·布尔加宁的任何这种话都不会刊登在报纸上。
    尼·亚·布尔加宁回答说，他没有什么话要转达。
