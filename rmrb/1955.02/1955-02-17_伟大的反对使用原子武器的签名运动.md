The Chairman of the All-China Association for Science and Technology Popularization, Liang Xi

    The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council issued a resounding call on January 19: Oppose Atomic War.

    This call has received a universal and enthusiastic response from people all over the world. From Europe to Asia, Africa, and the Americas, people in various countries are launching a vigorous signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons.

    Why is the response so rapid? This is because the people of the world see very clearly that there are two distinctly different lines on the issue of atomic energy: one is the peace line headed by the Soviet Union, and the other is the line of the American aggressive bloc.

    The Soviet line is a line of peace, a line for the happiness of mankind, a line of the people, a line of selfless dedication; the line of the American aggressive bloc is a line of war, a line of death, a line of monopoly capital, a line so ugly that it cannot be revealed.

    Signing is to support peace and oppose wars of aggression. The people of the world will not allow American imperialism to set fires everywhere, will not allow it to wage atomic war, will not allow it to arm German militarism, nor will they allow it to rely on the clamor of atomic war to霸占Taiwan and disrupt the Pacific.

    Signing is to move towards happiness, to crush the evil conspiracies of the American imperialists, and to avoid unnecessary death. The people of the world deeply sympathize with the Japanese people, will not allow the Hiroshima and Nagasaki incidents to be repeated, and will not allow another Japanese fisherman to be sacrificed in vain due to American imperialism's hydrogen bomb tests. The people of the world want to rely on nuclear radioactivity to develop power, to solve complex problems in biology and medicine, and to create special instruments for use in the metallurgical, paper, and rubber industries. We do not want the thinking of the former Acting Chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Pike, who thought that atomic energy research was for weapons, not for peaceful purposes, so it could develop so quickly.

    Signing is a powerful expression of the people of the world against a small handful of American monopoly capitalists. From every corner of the world, the same voice is issued, warning, scolding, and curbing those General Electric Companies, Union Carbide Companies, Rockefeller, DuPont, and Mellon Groups, telling these gentlemen not to indulge in wishful thinking, thinking that there will be good opportunities like the First and Second World Wars to come, to soak and fatten their private pockets with the blood of thousands of working people. On the contrary, if a real Third World War breaks out, it is they themselves who will perish.

    Signing can also prevent the unspeakable conspiracies of American imperialism over the years. American imperialism's得意article is: using Europeans to fight Europeans, using Asians to fight Asians, other countries send troops, the United States provides weapons, other countries die, the United States gets rich, other countries are destroyed, and the United States prospers. Atomic weapons kill more people and destroy more, and the Americans make money faster. They have unspeakable ghosts in their minds, so they emphasize atomic secrets. For twelve years, the United States has controlled the main uranium mines in the capitalist world, but it is unwilling to supply the fissionable materials and atomic energy technology that have been extracted to uranium-producing countries such as Belgium. From here, the greatness of the Soviet Union is even more evident: the Soviet Union has suggested to China and other countries to help study the peaceful use of atomic energy. Such a selfless act has never existed in history. The people of the world warmly praise this selfless attitude.

    The Chinese people, like the peace-loving people of the world, have always opposed aggression and atomic weapons, and have always expressed deep resentment towards Wall Street war dealers and their followers. Today, on the anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, we must use a vivid and cordial signing method to express the ardent feelings and great strength of 600 million people. We believe that no matter how rampant and unreasonable the American aggressive bloc is, hundreds of millions of hands pointing at them, hundreds of millions of mouths scolding them, and hundreds of millions of eyes monitoring them, let the imperialists tremble in the face of the unprecedentedly strong torrent of safeguarding world peace!

### 伟大的反对使用原子武器的签名运动

    伟大的反对使用原子武器的签名运动
    中华全国科学技术普及协会主席　梁希
    世界和平理事会常务委员会一月十九日发出了响亮的号召：反对原子战争。
    这个号召得到了全世界人民普遍的热烈的响应，从欧洲到亚洲、非洲、美洲，各国人民正在掀起一个轰轰烈烈的反对使用原子武器的签名运动。
    为什么响应得这样快？这是因为全世界人民看得很清楚：在原子能问题上，存在着截然不同的两条路线：一条是以苏联为首的和平路线，另一条是美国侵略集团的路线。
    苏联路线是和平的，为人类谋幸福的，人民的路线，是大公无私的路线；美国侵略集团的路线是战争的，死亡的，垄断资本的路线，是丑恶得不可告人的路线。
    签名，是为了拥护和平，反对侵略战争。全世界人民不许美帝国主义到处放火，不许它进行原子战争，不许它武装德国军国主义，也不许它凭仗原子战争的叫嚣来霸占台湾，扰乱太平洋。
    签名，是为了走向幸福，粉碎美帝国主义者的罪恶阴谋，避免不应有的死亡。全世界人民深切地同情日本人民，不许广岛和长崎事件重演，不许再有一个日本渔民因美帝国主义试验氢弹而白白牺牲。世界人民要依靠核子放射性来发展动力，来解决生物学和医学上的复杂问题，来创造冶金、造纸、橡胶工业所使用的特别仪器。不要像前任美国原子能委员会代理主席派克一样的想法，以为原子能的研究工作是为了武器，不是为了和平用途，所以能发展得这样快。
    签名，是全世界人民反对一小撮美国垄断资本家的有力表示。从全世界每一个角落发出同样的声音，警告、斥责和遏止那些通用电气公司、联合炭化物公司、洛克菲勒、杜邦和梅隆集团，叫这些老爷们不要痴心妄想，以为还有像第一次和第二次世界大战一样的好机会到来，把千千万万劳动人民的鲜血沾润和养肥他们的私囊。相反的，如果真的第三次世界大战发生，灭亡的正是他们自己。
    签名，还可以阻止美帝国主义历年来不可告人的阴谋。美帝国主义的得意文章是：用欧洲人打欧洲人，用亚洲人打亚洲人，别国出兵，美国出武器，别国死人，美国发财，别国毁灭，美国繁荣。原子武器杀人更多，毁灭更大，美国佬赚钱更快，他们怀着不可告人的鬼胎，所以强调原子秘密。十二年来，美国控制着资本主义世界的主要铀矿，而提炼出来的分裂物质及原子能技术，却不肯丝毫供给产铀国家如比利时等。从这里，越发显出苏联的伟大：苏联向中国及其他国家建议，帮助研究和平利用原子能，像这种大公无私的举动，历史上从来没有的。全世界人民热烈赞扬这种大公无私的态度。
    中国人民同世界爱好和平的人民一样，一贯反对侵略，反对原子武器，一贯对华尔街战争贩子及其附从者表示深切的愤恨。在纪念中苏友好同盟互助条约签订五周年的今天，我们必须用生动的亲切的签名方式来表示六亿人民热烈的心情和伟大的力量。我们相信，不管美国侵略集团怎样横行霸道，怎样蛮不讲理，全世界几万万双手指着他们，几万万只口骂着他们，几万万双眼睛监视着他们，在空前壮大的保卫世界和平的洪流面前，让帝国主义者发抖吧！
