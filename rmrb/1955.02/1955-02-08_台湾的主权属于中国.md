Taiwan's Sovereignty Belongs to China
Chen Tiqiang, Director of the China Political Science and Law Society

As the U.S. imperialist plot to霸占 Taiwan and interfere in our internal affairs becomes increasingly frantic, the arguments of the chorus of supporters in some Western countries become even more absurd and shameless. They are racking their brains and leaving no stone unturned to create excuses for the U.S. imperialist acts of aggression. They seem to like waving the banner of law to deceive, because the words of the law seem somewhat "mysterious" and sound plausible. This is just what the U.S. imperialists like, because they are worried about the lack of "legal basis" for their aggression. A recent letter in the London "Times" by George Schwarzenberger, Deputy Professor of International Law at the University of London, is an example of providing a "legal basis" for U.S. imperialism.

Schwarzenberger's basic argument is nothing more than the old and stale tune of denying the validity of the Cairo Declaration. His "new" argument has nothing unique and is full of contradictions and sophistry. However, these statements of his should not be regarded as purely personal opinions. The statement made by British Foreign Secretary Eden in the House of Commons on the 4th of this month has adopted these arguments. Therefore, it is necessary to sternly refute this kind of "legal" fallacy.

Like Britain's attitude on the Taiwan issue, Schwarzenberger's talk is full of contradictions: on the one hand, he admits that the U.S. and Britain undertook obligations to return Taiwan to China, and said that Japan was bound by this understanding because it accepted the Potsdam Proclamation; on the other hand, he said whether the U.S. and Britain are prepared to fulfill these obligations is "another matter"; on the one hand, he admits that the U.S. and Britain undertook obligations in the Cairo Declaration, on the other hand, he said the provision in the Cairo Declaration on the return of Taiwan is "a retroactive moral condemnation" and does not affect the "cession effect" of the 1895 Sino-Japanese Treaty of Shimonoseki. Therefore, Schwarzenberger draws two contradictory conclusions: on the one hand, he says that Japan should implement any arrangements made by the Allies, but at the same time he says that before the conclusion of the illegal San Francisco "Peace Treaty," "Taiwan was still legally part of Japan." Schwarzenberger believes that the San Francisco "Peace Treaty" changed this state, making Taiwan a "shared" land of the "Treaty" signatories other than Japan, just as Germany gave up its overseas territories to the main Allied powers after World War I under the Treaty of Versailles. Therefore, according to Schwarzenberger's wishful thinking, the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary government, which took over Taiwan at that time, only exercised a kind of "agency power" in Taiwan, and the United States, Britain and other countries had complete freedom to decide the future of Taiwan or hand it over to the United Nations.

This argument can be described as absurd. Precisely because of this, it may be appreciated by U.S. imperialism. The U.S. imperialist propagandist Lippmann is using these absurd arguments of Britain to create a basis for the U.S. occupation of China's territory of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands.

Schwarzenberger's entire argument starts from denying the validity of the Cairo Declaration, so we must first study what the Cairo Declaration is: an international treaty or a "moral condemnation"? Is it only binding on Japan, or is it also binding on the United States and Britain? If a correct answer is obtained on this point, his other arguments will be self-defeating.

First, it must be pointed out that the Cairo Declaration is a solemn international treaty. Treaties can take various forms, but their essence is that they express the agreement between the contracting states. McNair, a famous British authority on treaty law, defines "treaty" in his book "The Law of Treaties" as "the general term for documents with various names, which stipulate international agreements between countries or between heads of state or governments." "Declaration" is one of these documents. McNair's definition of "declaration" is: "A treaty that declares existing law (whether amended or not) or creates new law." In addition, Article 1 of the draft "Convention on Treaty Law" drafted by the Harvard University International Law Research Department in 1935 also stipulates that a treaty is "a formal document of agreement used by two or more countries to establish or seek to establish international legal relations with each other." According to these definitions, the Cairo Declaration is undoubtedly a formal international treaty. It is completely untenable to say that the Cairo Declaration is a statement of "intent" or that it does not have certain domestic legal procedures and therefore has no binding force. As long as an agreement is reached between governments that have the power to represent the country, it constitutes a treaty between the countries. In fact, Schwarzenberger has to admit that the Cairo Declaration is an "obligation undertaken by China, the United States, and the United Kingdom regarding the intention to return Taiwan to China."

Since obligations are undertaken, they must be fulfilled. This is the minimum condition for coexistence and cooperation between countries. The Cairo Declaration was signed by China, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Later, the Soviet Union also became a participant in the Cairo Declaration due to its participation in the Potsdam Proclamation. Since Japan accepted the Potsdam Proclamation and surrendered unconditionally, the Cairo Declaration became a treaty between China, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Its terms came into effect immediately and were effective for all contracting states. It is unfounded to say that they are only effective for Japan, or that they must wait for the signing of a peace treaty with Japan before they come into effect.

Because, obviously, as long as the Cairo Declaration is effective for Japan, Japan cannot but involve the rights of the Allied countries when fulfilling the terms of the Cairo Declaration. The Cairo Declaration stipulates that "the territories Japan has stolen from China, such as Manchuria, Taiwan, and the Penghu Islands, shall be returned to China." If Japan wants to fulfill this provision, it can only "return to China" Manchuria, Taiwan, Penghu and other places, because according to the Cairo Declaration, it cannot hand them over to others. Therefore, it is legally impossible to think that the Cairo Declaration is only binding on Japan and not on the Allied countries.

In fact, China's takeover of Taiwan on October 25, 1945, was precisely to implement the provisions of the Cairo Declaration. British Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Mayhew said very clearly in the British House of Commons on November 21, 1949: "It was in accordance with the Cairo Declaration that the Chinese authorities took control of the island when Japan surrendered, and have since exercised control over the island." In a statement by U.S. Secretary of State Acheson on January 5, 1950, he also said: "The island of Taiwan was handed over to the Chinese in accordance with the established declaration and surrender conditions. The Chinese have ruled Taiwan for four years. The United States or any other ally has never questioned this power and occupation. When Taiwan was regarded as a province of China, no one ever raised any legal doubts about it. This move is considered to be in line with various agreements."

It is obviously unnecessary to cite more evidence.

Schwarzenberger cannot obliterate the fact that China took over, but he tries to quibble that China took over Taiwan with the consent of the "Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Far East," thus proving that he was only exercising a kind of "agency power." But who gave the "Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Far East" the power? Did it have the power to "disagree" with China taking over? That is obviously impossible, because the "Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Far East" can only act in accordance with the Cairo Declaration. Japan did not hand over Taiwan to the "Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Far East," and then handed it over to Chiang Kai-shek; according to the Cairo Declaration, it could only hand it over to China, and in fact it did so.

As far as the various post-war arrangements are concerned, the Cairo Declaration is the foundation of the peace treaty with Japan. This declaration of course cancels and changes all past treaties and legal relationships that conflict with it. The Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895 was a treaty of subjugation that Japanese imperialism forced China to sign through aggression, and of course it is impossible to recognize that it still has any effect. China has formally announced the abolition of all treaties between China and Japan, including the Treaty of Shimonoseki, on December 8, 1941. If today, after the Chinese people have fought a bloody war of resistance for eight years and defeated Japanese imperialism, someone dares to say that this Treaty of Shimonoseki, which the Chinese people regard as a great shame, has the effect of "cession," while China's sovereignty over its inherent territory is invalid, it is a great insult to the Chinese people. The Cairo Declaration makes it very clear that the purpose of the Allied countries in waging war is "to curb and punish Japanese aggression." The principle of aggression must never be maintained, the treaty of aggression must never exist, and the territory occupied by the aggressor must be returned to the original owner. U.S. President Roosevelt, who signed the Cairo Declaration, said in a radio address on December 24, 1943, when talking about the principles of the Cairo Declaration: "These principles are both simple and basic, including the return of stolen property to its rightful owner." If anyone still believes that aggression is legal today, they have completely failed to learn from history.

Even putting aside the principle of "returning things to their original owner," Taiwan should be returned to China is also supported by an ancient legal principle, which is the principle in Roman law that "wrongdoers cannot acquire rights." Professor Lauterpacht, the current judge of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, pointed out in his book "The Problem of Recognition in International Law" that this principle applies to international law. He said: "Acts that violate international law are invalid and cannot be the basis for the legal rights of wrongdoers." No matter how "exemplary" the Treaty of Shimonoseki was in the eyes of imperialists at the end of the nineteenth century, after World War II, it has been definitively impossible to recognize in international law that this treaty can still be the legal basis for aggressors to retain occupied territory. The Cairo Declaration says that the territories that Japan has "stolen" from China should be returned, which is not just a "retroactive moral condemnation," but establishes a new principle of international law, which applies not only to Japan's past aggression, but also to any future aggression.

It should be particularly pointed out that the territories that Japan "stole" from China in the Cairo Declaration include not only Northeast China (Manchuria), but also Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. It can be seen that in the eyes of the signatories of the Cairo Declaration, there is no difference in the legal status of Taiwan and Penghu and Northeast China. These places should be directly returned to China. Just as many European countries that were invaded by the Nazis immediately restored their lost territories after defeating Germany, Taiwan, Penghu and the Northeast should also be taken back by China with the victory of the Allied forces. This is a very obvious principle. Otherwise, if the peace treaty with Germany has not yet been signed today, can France, the Netherlands, Belgium and other countries not obtain sovereignty over their territories, and must wait for the peace treaty to finally determine it? Is the status of the islands of Guernsey, Jersey, and Alderney in the English Channel, which were liberated after being occupied by the German Kou for five years, still undetermined today? It is obvious at a glance that this statement is absolutely absurd.

It is a matter of course that territories lost due to foreign aggression should be returned to their original owners after the aggressor is defeated, and there is no need to wait for the treaty to decide. Since nearly ten years have passed since the end of actual hostilities in the post-World War II peace treaties with Germany and Japan, it is especially impossible to leave the issue of recovering lost territories indefinitely to be determined by the treaty. If such a principle is recognized, then the defeated aggressor can instead use the method of delaying the signing of the treaty to occupy the territory of the victorious country indefinitely, which is simply inconceivable.

According to the Cairo Declaration, can it be interpreted that Taiwan and Penghu were abandoned by Japan to the "shared" ownership of the Allied countries? Obviously, no basis can be found for this in the Cairo Declaration. Schwarzenberger's attempt to compare the status of Taiwan with the German overseas territories after World War I is obviously not appropriate. Because what should be compared with Taiwan and Penghu should be Alsace-Lorraine, not the German overseas territories. Article 51 of the Treaty of Versailles stipulates: "The territories ceded to Germany by the draft peace treaty signed in Versailles on February 26, 1871, and the Treaty of Frankfurt on May 10, 1871, shall be restored to the sovereignty of France from the date of the armistice on November 11, 1918. The provisions of the treaties on the demarcation of boundaries before 1871 shall be restored to effect." It can be seen that Alsace-Lorraine, which originally belonged to France, should be returned to France, and the German overseas territories, which originally belonged to Germany, should be handed over to the main Allied countries for further distribution, which is handled according to two completely different principles. For Taiwan and Penghu, obviously only the former example applies. Moreover, according to this example, Taiwan and Penghu should be returned to China at the end of World War II, and they should never wait until after the conclusion of the treaty. This is obvious. In fact, Taiwan and Penghu were taken back by China after the end of the war.

According to the above analysis, since the Cairo Declaration has become a valid treaty between China, the Soviet Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan, these five countries are obligated to abide by it. It is naturally illegal and invalid for some of the five countries to separately conclude treaties that conflict with the Cairo Declaration. British Professor Oppenheim said in his "International Law": The contracting states "have an obligation not to conclude treaties that are inconsistent with the obligations of the original treaty. The conclusion of such a treaty is an illegal act and cannot produce legal consequences that are beneficial to the wrongdoer." Therefore, any statement about the illegal San Francisco separate "peace treaty with Japan" can decide to hand over Taiwan and Penghu to this or that country is an illegal act like the division of spoils by bandits, and it will absolutely not have any legal effect.

Legally speaking, there is only one conclusion: the legal sovereignty of Taiwan and Penghu belongs to China; currently they are under the occupation of a small number of traitors in China, and the Chinese people have the right and the obligation to drive out these traitors and liberate these territories. No sophistry of imperialist propagandists can change the truth that Taiwan belongs to China, nor can it shake the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan.

    台湾的主权属于中国
    中国政治法律学会理事　陈体强
    随着美帝国主义霸占台湾、干涉我国内政的阴谋活动日益疯狂，西方某些国家中的帮腔者的论调也越发荒谬无耻。他们正在挖尽心思、无孔不入地替美帝国主义的侵略行为制造借口。他们似乎很喜欢打着法律的旗帜来进行欺骗，因为法律的词句多少显得有点“玄妙”，听起来似是而非的。这正投合了美帝国主义的所好，因为它正在为着自己的侵略行为缺少“法律根据”而担忧。最近在伦敦“泰晤士报”上刊载的伦敦国际法副教授乔治·施瓦森柏格的一封信，便是向美帝国主义提供“法律根据”的一个例子。
    施瓦森柏格的基本论点不外还是抵赖开罗宣言的效力这一旧得发臭的老调子，他的“新”的论点也并没有什么独到之处，而且是矛盾百出，强词夺理的。但是他的这些说法不能认为纯粹是个人意见，英国外交大臣艾登本月四日在下院的声明恰恰就是采用了这些论点，因此对于这一类的“法律”谬论加以严正的驳斥是有必要的。
    和英国在台湾问题上的态度一样，施瓦森柏格的谈法是充满了矛盾的：他一方面承认美英对于把台湾归还中国一事承担了义务，并说日本因接受了波茨坦公告而受了这种谅解的约束，另一方面却说美英是否准备履行这些义务，则是“另外的问题”；他一方面承认美英在开罗宣言上承担了义务，另一方面却说开罗宣言中关于归还台湾的规定是“一种追溯性的道义谴责”，不影响一八九五年中日马关条约的“割让效力”。因此，施瓦森柏格便得出两个互相矛盾的结论：一方面说日本应该执行盟国作出的任何安排，同时却说在旧金山非法的“对日和约”缔结以前，“台湾在法律上仍然是日本的一部分。”施瓦森柏格认为旧金山“和约”改变了这一状态，它使得台湾成为日本以外的“和约”缔约国的
  “共有”土地，就像第一次世界大战后德国根据凡尔赛和约把它的海外属地放弃给主要协约国一样。因此，按照施瓦森柏格想入非非的说法，当时接管台湾的蒋介石反动政府在台湾仅只行使一种“代理的权力”，而美英等国却有决定台湾前途或把它交给联合国的完全自由。
    这种论调可以说是荒谬绝伦的。正因此，它才可能得到美帝国主义的赏识。美帝国主义的宣传家李普曼正在利用英国的这些荒谬论调为美国侵占中国领土台湾和澎湖制造根据了。
    施瓦森柏格的整个说法都是从否认开罗宣言的效力出发的，因此首先要研究一下开罗宣言到底是什么：是一个国际条约，还是一种“道义谴责”？是只对日本有约束力，还是对美英也有约束力？如果在这一点上得到正确解答，他的其他论点也就不攻自破了。
    首先，必须指出，开罗宣言是一个庄严的国际条约。条约可以采用各种各样的形式，但它的本质是它表现着缔约国间的协议。英国关于条约法的著名权威学者麦克奈尔在他所著的“条约法”一书中，开宗明义便把“条约”定义为“具有各种名称的文件的总称，其中订明各国或各国的元首或政府之间的国际协议”。“宣言”是这些文件之一种。麦克奈尔对“宣言”的定义是：“一个宣示现行法律（无论是否加以修改），或创立新法律的条约。”又哈佛大学国际法研究部一九三五年草拟的“条约法公约”草案第一条也规定条约是“两个或两个以上的国家用以建立或设法建立彼此间的国际法上的关系的协议的正式文件”。根据这些定义，开罗宣言是一个正式的国际条约，那是毫无疑义的。把开罗宣言说成是一种说明“意图的声明”，或者说它没有具备某种国内法上的手续，因而没有拘束力的说法是完全不能成立的。只要有权力代表国家的政府之间达成协议，便构成国家之间的条约。实际上，施瓦森柏格不得不承认开罗宣言是中、美、英三国“关于把台湾归还给中国的意图所承担的义务”。
      既然承担了义务，就要履行这种义务，这是国家间共处合作的起码条件。开罗宣言是由中、美、英三国所签订，后来苏联由于参加了波茨坦公告而也成为开罗宣言的参加者。由于日本接受了波茨坦公告而无条件投降，开罗宣言也就成了中、苏、美、英、日五国之间的条约。它的条款立即生效，并且是对所有缔约国生效的。说它们只是对日本生效，或说它们必须等待签订了对日和约方才生效，是没有根据的。
    因为，显而易见的，只要开罗宣言对日本生效，日本在履行开罗宣言的条款的时候就不可能不涉及各盟国的权利。开罗宣言规定“使日本所窃取于中国之领土，例如满洲、台湾、澎湖群岛等，归还中国”。日本要履行这一条规定，就只有把满洲、台湾、澎湖等地“归还中国”，因为根据开罗宣言，它不可能交给别人。因此，认为开罗宣言只对日本有拘束力，对盟国没有拘束力的说法，在法律上是不可能的。
    事实上，中国于一九四五年十月二十五日接收了台湾，恰恰就是执行开罗宣言的规定。英国外交部次官梅休一九四九年十一月二十一日在英国下院说得很清楚：“是根据开罗宣言，中国当局在日本投降的时候对该岛加以控制，并在此后一直行使着对该岛的控制”。一九五○年一月五日，美国国务卿艾奇逊的声明中也说：“台湾岛即依照已成立的宣言及投降条件交与中国人。中国人已统治台湾四年。美国或任何其他盟国从未对该项权力及占领发生过任何疑问。当台湾被作为中国的一个省份的时候，没有任何人曾对此提出过任何法律上的疑难。此举经认为是符合各项约定的。”
    更多地引证其他的证据，显然是不必要的。
    施瓦森柏格不能抹煞中国接管这一事实，但他企图诡辩说，中国是在“盟国远东军最高统帅部”同意之下接管台湾的，因此就证明他只是行使一种“代理的权力”。但是谁又给了“盟国远东军最高统帅部”以权力呢？难道它有权力可以“不同意”中国去接管吗？那显然是不可能的，因为“盟国远东军最高统帅部”也只能按照开罗宣言办事。日本并没有把台湾交给“盟国远东军最高统帅部”，然后由它交给蒋介石；按照开罗宣言它只能交给中国，而事实上它是照这样办了。
    就其关于战后各种安排而言，开罗宣言就是对日和约的基础。这个宣言当然取消和改变了和它相冲突的一切过去的条约和法律关系。一八九五年的马关条约是日本帝国主义侵略中国、逼迫中国订立的城下之盟，当然不可能再承认它有任何效力。中国于一九四一年十二月八日已经正式宣布废止中日间一切条约，包括马关条约在内。如果在中国人民八年流血抗战、打败了日本帝国主义之后的今天，还有人胆敢说这个中国人民认为奇耻大辱的马关条约有“割让”的效力，而中国对它固有领土的主权却是无效的，那是对中国人民的极大侮辱。开罗宣言说得很清楚，盟国进行战争的目的“在于制止及惩罚日本之侵略”。侵略的原则决不许其维持，侵略的条约决不许其存在，侵略者所占据的领土必须归还原主。签订开罗宣言的美国罗斯福总统一九四三年十二月二十四日在广播演说中谈及开罗宣言的原则时说：“这些原则既简单，又基本，其中包括归还偷盗的财产给当然的主人”。今天如果还有人认为侵略是合法的，那是完全没有从历史中吸取教训。
    即使撇开“物归原主”的道理不讲，台湾应归还中国还受有一个古老的法律原则的支持，这就是罗马法上“违法者不能取得权利”的原则。现任海牙国际法院法官的英国劳特派教授在他所著“国际法上的承认问题”一书中指出，这原则是适用于国际法的。他说：“违反国际法的行为是无效的，不能成为违法者法律权利的根据。”无论在十九世纪末年在帝国主义的眼中马关条约是怎样“楷模足式”的，在第二次世界大战以后，在国际法上已经肯定地不能再承认这种条约还能成为侵略者保有侵占的领土的法律依据。开罗宣言说日本所“窃取”于中国的领土应该归还，决不仅仅是一种“追溯性的道义谴责”，而是确立了一个新的国际法原则，这个原则不仅适用于过去的日本的侵略，并且也适用于今后的任何侵略。
    特别应该指出的，开罗宣言所称的日本“窃取”于中国的领土不仅指中国东北（满洲），而且也包括台湾和澎湖。可见在开罗宣言的签字者看来，台湾澎湖的地位和中国东北的法律地位是没有区别的，这些地方都应该直接归还给中国。正如欧洲许多被纳粹侵略的国家于战胜德国之后，立即恢复了它们的失地一样，台湾澎湖和东北也应当随着盟军的胜利而由中国收回，这是十分明显的道理。否则，今天对德和约尚未签订，是否法国、荷兰、比利时等国对它们国土还不能取得主权，而有待于和约最后加以确定呢？被德寇占领五年之后获得解放的英国在英伦海峡中的根赛、泽西、阿德尔尼等岛的地位是否今日也还未确定呢？一望而知，这种提法是绝对荒谬的。
      这种由于外国侵略而失去的领土，于侵略者被击败之后归还原主，是理所当然的，根本不须等待和约决定。第二次世界大战后对德日两国的和约在实际敌对行为结束后已经过了将近十年尚未签订，在这种情形下尤其不可能把收复失土问题无限期地留待和约确定。如果承认这样的原则，那么被击败的侵略者反而可以用拖延签订和约的办法把战胜国的领土无限期地占领下去，这简直是不可思议的事。
    根据开罗宣言，是否可以解释为台湾澎湖是由日本放弃给盟国“共有”呢？显然这在开罗宣言上是找不到任何根据的。施瓦森柏格企图拿台湾的地位和第一次大战以后德国的海外属地相比拟，显然是拟不于伦。因为，和台湾澎湖相比拟的应当是阿尔萨斯—洛林，而不是德国海外属地。凡尔赛和约第五十一条规定：“自一九一八年十一月十一日停战之日起，因一八七一年二月二十六日在凡尔赛签定之和议草约及一八七一年五月十日佛兰克福条约让与德国之领土，复归法国主权之下。凡一八七一年以前关于划定疆界各条约之规定，均应回复效力。”可见，原来属法国的阿尔萨斯—洛林应当归还法国，和原来属德国的海外属地交与主要盟国日后再行分配，是根据两种迥然不同的原则办理的。对于台湾澎湖，显然只适用前一种例子。而且，照这个例子，台湾澎湖应当在第二次世界大战一结束时就归还中国，它们决不应当等到缔结和约之后才归还。这是明显的。事实上，台湾澎湖正是在战争结束之后就由中国收回了的。
    根据上文分析，既然开罗宣言已成为中、苏、美、英、日五国间的有效条约，这五个国家都负有义务予以遵守。五个国家之中有一部分国家自己另外订立与开罗宣言相抵触的条约，自然是非法的、无效的。英国奥本海教授在他的“国际法”一书中说：缔约国“有义务不缔结与原先的条约的义务不合的条约。缔结这种条约是一种违法行为，不能够产生对违法者有利的法律后果。”因此，任何关于非法的旧金山单独“对日和约”可以决定把台湾和澎湖交给这个或那个国家的说法，都是和强盗分赃一样的非法行为，绝对不发生任何法律效力。
    从法律上来说，结论只有一条：台湾澎湖的法律主权属于中国；目前它们是在中国的一小撮卖国贼窃踞之下，中国人民有权利也有义务把这些卖国贼驱逐出去，解放这些领土。帝国主义宣传家的任何诡辩都不能改变台湾属于中国的这个真理，也丝毫不能动摇中国人民解放台湾的决心。
