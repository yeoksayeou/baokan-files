Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 5th: The Soviet people are warmly welcoming the resolution of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union "On Increasing the Production of Animal Products." Collective farmers, state farm and machine tractor station workers in various regions are proposing guarantees to implement the resolutions of the Plenary Session as quickly as possible.

Livestock breeders in the Altai Krai guarantee to further increase the number of livestock and improve the productivity of livestock products. Milkmaids from the "Red Guerrilla," "Defend Peace," "Soviet State," and many other collective farms stated that they would strive to produce 2,500 kilograms of milk per cow per year and 25 piglets per sow per year. They also guaranteed that the weight of pigs fattened in sheds would reach 130 to 150 kilograms each.

Builders from collective farms in the Altai Krai also participated in the competition to develop public animal husbandry. For example, the construction team working at the Stalin Collective Farm guaranteed to complete ten new livestock sheds ahead of schedule.

Agricultural workers in the Novosibirsk Oblast are preparing to further develop animal husbandry. According to the tasks put forward by the CPSU Central Committee Plenary Session, the Cherepanov State Farm decided to further strengthen its feed base, mainly by expanding the planting area of silage corn—a new crop for Siberia.

Agricultural workers in many other regions of the Soviet Union have also proposed plans to expand the planting area of corn. In the area served by the Kharkov Machine Tractor Station in Ukraine, the planting area of corn will be doubled. The planting area of corn in the northern districts of the Kirov Oblast of the Russian Federation will be expanded five to six times.

Agricultural machinery manufacturing workers in Kharkov, Rubtsovsk, Chelyabinsk and other cities stated that they would actively participate in the socialist competition and strive to quickly and excellently complete and over fulfill the task of manufacturing machinery and tools for socialist agriculture.

    苏联人民热烈欢迎苏共中央全会决议
    提出保证要增加牲畜头数提高畜产品生产率
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科四日讯：苏联人民热烈欢迎苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议“关于增加畜牧业产品生产”的决议。各地集体农庄庄员、国营农场和机器拖拉机站的工作人员，正在纷纷提出保证，要尽速实现全体会议的决议。
    阿尔泰边疆区的牲畜饲养者保证要进一步增加牲畜的头数和提高畜产品生产率。“红色游击队”、
  “保卫和平”、“苏维埃国家”和其他许多集体农庄的挤奶女庄员表示，她们要争取每头奶牛每年出奶两千五百公斤，每口猪每年养二十五口小猪。她们还保证使实行舍饲肥育的猪每口重量达到一百三十至一百五十公斤。
    阿尔泰边疆区的集体农庄的建筑者也参加了争取发展公共畜牧业的竞赛。例如，在斯大林集体农庄工作的建筑队，保证要使十个新畜舍提前落成。
    新西伯利亚州的农业工作人员准备进一步发展畜牧业。切列帕诺夫国营农场根据苏共中央全体会议所提出的任务，决定进一步加强饲料基地，主要办法就是扩大青储玉蜀黍——对西伯利亚来说是一种新作物——的播种面积。
    苏联其他许多地区的农业劳动者也提出了扩大玉蜀黍播种面积的计划。在乌克兰哈尔科夫机器拖拉机站所服务的地区，玉蜀黍的播种面积将增加为二倍。俄罗斯联邦基洛夫州北部各区的玉蜀黍播种面积将扩大到五、六倍。
    哈尔科夫、鲁布佐夫斯克、车里雅宾斯克等城市的农业机器制造工人表示，他们要积极参加社会主义竞赛，争取迅速和出色地完成和超额完成为社会主义农业制造机器和工具的任务。
