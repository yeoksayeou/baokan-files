Xinhua News Agency, February 5th: China's steel industry successfully trial-produced a batch of new specifications of steel grades and steel products in 1954. Among the more than forty new specifications of steel grades successfully trial-produced by steelmaking workers last year, many are valuable raw materials indispensable in industrial construction. Among them, there are more than a dozen different specifications of heat-resistant stainless steel with high heat resistance and acid resistance. Heat-resistant stainless steel is an important raw material for the aviation industry and the electrical machinery industry to manufacture turbine blades; the coal mining industry, the chemical industry, and the food industry also urgently need this product. The free-cutting steel successfully trial-produced last year has excellent processing performance and a smooth surface after cutting, making it suitable for use on automatic lathes. With the continuous development of the machinery industry, the use of this free-cutting steel will become more and more extensive. The four types of ball bearing steel successfully trial-produced in China in 1951 could only be used to make small and medium-sized ball bearings. In 1954, a type of steel that can be used to make large ball bearings was successfully trial-produced. A high-grade welding rod steel successfully trial-produced by Anshan Iron and Steel's steelmaking workers last year according to Soviet standards guarantees the needs of basic construction welding projects. Welding rods made of this steel can be used to weld large railway bridges, metal structures of large factories, iron-smelting furnaces, ships, automobiles, and high-pressure boilers and steam pipes.

　　Rolling mill workers successfully trial-produced several important alloy steel materials last year and expanded the types of ordinary steel profile steels. Anshan Iron and Steel's seamless steel pipe plant successfully trial-produced an alloy seamless steel pipe last year, which is used to manufacture ball bearings. Compared with using bearing alloy round steel to drill holes, it can not only reduce machining but also save a lot of bearing alloy steel. Among the 28 types of ordinary steel added last year, there are large I-beams, large channel steels, and various specifications of large angle steels and steel window materials for building factories, bridges, and manufacturing train carriages.

　　Many new steel grades and new steel materials successfully trial-produced by China's steel industry last year, such as heat-resistant stainless steel and high-grade welding rod steel, could not be manufactured in the past. The successful trial production of these products marks a significant improvement in the technical level of China's steel industry. Although China had rolling mills long ago, it lacked talents to design rolling mill pass shapes, so the variety of steel materials produced was greatly limited. Last year, Soviet experts helped China train more than 20 rolling mill pass shape designers, creating conditions for China's rolling mills to expand the variety of steel materials. Last year, Anshan Iron and Steel alone designed 51 types of rolling mill pass shapes. In the past, the high-quality steel produced in China generally had to be smelted in electric furnaces, which had high costs and greatly limited production. With the help of Soviet experts, eight types of high-quality steel, such as carbon tool steel, were successfully trial-smelted in open-hearth furnaces last year, creating conditions for the mass production of inexpensive high-quality steel. After learning Soviet advanced experience such as blowing oxygen during the oxidation period last year, electric furnace steelmaking workers not only accelerated the smelting time of alloy steel but also improved the quality of alloy steel.

    我国钢铁工业技术水平显著提高
    去年试制成功四十多种新产品
    【新华社五日讯】我国钢铁工业在一九五四年试制成功一批新规格的钢种和钢材。炼钢工人去年试制成功的四十多种新规格的钢种里面，有很多是工业建设中不可缺少的贵重原料。其中具有耐高热和耐酸性能的耐热不锈钢，就有十几种不同的规格。耐热不锈钢是航空工业和电机工业制造透平机叶片的重要原材料；采煤工业、化学工业和食品工业中也十分需要这种产品。去年试制成功的易切钢，加工性能很好，切削以后表面光滑，适合在自动车床上使用。随着机械工业的不断发展，这种易切钢的用途将越来越大。一九五一年我国试制成功的四种滚珠轴承钢，只能做中小型的滚珠轴承，一九五四年，又试制成功了一种可以做大型滚珠轴承的钢种。鞍钢炼钢工人去年按照苏联标准试制成功的一种高级焊条钢，保证了基本建设焊接工程的需要。用这种钢制成焊条，可以焊接大型的铁路桥梁、大型厂房的金属结构、炼铁炉、轮船、汽车和高压的锅炉、蒸汽管道等。
    轧钢工人去年试制成功几种重要的合金钢材，并且扩大了普通钢材的型钢品种，鞍钢无缝钢管厂去年试制成功的一种合金无缝钢管，用来制造滚珠轴承，比用轴承合金圆钢掏眼车制，不但可以减少机械加工，而且可以节省很多轴承合金钢。去年增加的二十八种普通钢材里面，有建筑厂房、桥梁和制造火车车辆用的大型工字钢、大型槽钢和各种规格的大型角钢和钢窗料等。
    我国钢铁工业去年试制成功的耐热不锈钢、高级焊条钢等许多新钢种和新钢材，都是过去不能制造的。这些产品的试制成功，标志着我国钢铁工业技术水平的显著提高。我国虽然早就有了轧钢工厂，但却缺少设计轧钢孔型的人才，因此生产的钢材品种受到了很大限制。去年苏联专家帮助我国培养了二十多个轧辊孔型设计人员，替我国轧钢厂扩大钢材品种创造了条件。去年，只是鞍钢就设计了五十一种轧辊孔型。过去我国出产的优质钢一般都要用电炉冶炼，成本比较高，产量也受到很大限制。在苏联专家的帮助下，去年用平炉试炼成功炭素工具钢等八种优质钢，为大量生产廉价的优质钢创造了条件。电炉炼钢工人去年学习在氧化期吹氧气等苏联先进经验后，不但加速了合金钢的冶炼时间，并且还提高了合金钢的质量。
