    The Soviet Union's selfless assistance is an important guarantee for the victorious construction of socialism in our country
　　-- Written to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance
    Li Fuchun, Vice Premier of the State Council and Director of the State Planning Commission
    It has been five years since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance. These five years have witnessed the increasingly consolidated and developed close friendship and mutual cooperation between the two great fraternal countries of China and the Soviet Union. The historical facts of the past five years have irrefutably proven that the great alliance between China and the Soviet Union is the most powerful factor in ensuring peace and security in the Far East and the world. The increasing consolidation and development of this alliance have brought and will continue to bring about the shameful failure of all the evil attempts by American imperialism to instigate wars and enslave mankind in the East and the West. The historical facts of the past five years have also fully proven that the sincere and selfless enormous assistance given to our country by the Soviet government and people in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and related agreements between the two countries is of extreme importance for the rapid restoration and development of our national economy and for the realization of our first Five-Year Plan centered on socialist industrialization.
    When the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance was signed five years ago, our country was facing the following situation: the People's Republic of China had not been established for long, and the imperialists were doing everything possible to sabotage and strangle the new people's China; after a long period of war, the domestic economy had been greatly damaged, and we lacked experience in managing complex economic undertakings, especially modern industry. It was under such circumstances that the Soviet government concluded the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance with our country, giving our country enormous assistance. The fact that we were able to restore the national economy, which had been devastated by long-term warfare, in a short period of three years on the basis of consolidating and strengthening the people's democratic dictatorship based on the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class, and quickly embark on the road of planned construction, is inseparable from the Soviet Union's assistance to our country.
    From 1953, our country began to implement the first Five-Year Plan centered on socialist industrialization. Based on the successful experience of the Soviet Union in building socialism, in order to realize socialist industrialization in our country, it is first necessary to build heavy industry. However, large-scale industrial construction, especially heavy industrial construction, will inevitably encounter many difficulties for a country like ours with a backward economy. The main difficulties facing us in economic construction at that time were: unclear resources, backward technology, and lack of experience. The Soviet Union's assistance played a huge role in overcoming the above difficulties.
    In May 1953, at the request of our country, and after consultations between the Chinese and Soviet governments, the Soviet government decided to help our country build and rebuild 141 important enterprises that are of decisive significance for our country's socialist industrialization, including modern iron and steel complexes, non-ferrous metallurgical enterprises, coal mining enterprises, petroleum enterprises, various heavy machinery manufacturing plants, automobile manufacturing plants, tractor manufacturing plants, aircraft manufacturing plants, power stations, chemical plants, etc. According to the agreement signed between the Chinese and Soviet governments, these enterprises will begin construction during our country's first Five-Year Plan, and most of them will be completed or partially completed and put into production around 1958. After these enterprises are completed, our country's industrial production level and technical level will greatly increase. We will be able to supply the needs of national economic development with more steel, coal, electricity, non-ferrous metal products, and chemical fertilizers. Our country will be able to manufacture metallurgical equipment, power generation equipment, mining equipment, oil extraction equipment, airplanes, automobiles, and tractors, etc., which have never been manufactured in our history. In short, the construction of these enterprises will fundamentally change the backward state of our country's economy, thereby enabling our country to take a big step forward on the road to the great goal of socialist industrialization. There is no doubt that the construction of these enterprises is of extremely great significance for strengthening our country's economic and defense strength in order to build socialism.
    In October 1954, during the visit of the Soviet government delegation headed by Comrade Khrushchev to our country, the Chinese and Soviet governments held talks. As a result of the talks, a joint declaration on Sino-Soviet relations and various international issues, a joint declaration on relations with Japan, a joint communiqué on the withdrawal of the Soviet army from the jointly used Chinese Lushun Naval Base and the transfer of the base to the complete control of the People's Republic of China, a joint communiqué on the transfer of Soviet shares in various joint-stock companies to the People's Republic of China, a joint communiqué on the signing of a scientific and technological cooperation agreement, a joint communiqué on the construction of the Lanzhou-Urumqi-Alma Ata railway and the organization of joint transportation, and a joint communiqué among China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia on the construction of a railway from Jining to Ulaanbaatar and the organization of joint transportation were issued; in addition, a protocol on the Soviet government's assistance to our country in building fifteen new industrial enterprises and expanding the scope of equipment supply for the 141 enterprises stipulated in the original agreement was also signed. All these historically significant documents not only once again expressed the determination of the people of China and the Soviet Union to further consolidate and expand the fraternal friendship between the two countries and to jointly strive to safeguard peace and security in Asia and the world, but also once again expressed the lofty internationalist concern and assistance of the Soviet government and people for our country's socialist construction.
    For five years, the various forms of assistance that the Soviet government has given to our country in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and other agreements on Soviet assistance to our country in developing the national economy, especially the assistance in building new industrial enterprises, have been carried out according to the original plan. By the end of 1954, among the enterprises that the Soviet Union helped our country to build and rebuild, 19 enterprises had been completed or partially completed and put into production, including the large rolling mill, seamless steel tube plant, and sheet metal plant of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, and the Haizhou open-pit mine in Fuxin. Thirty-four enterprises are under construction; for the remaining enterprises, except for individual coal mines whose resource situation has not been fully clarified and requires further exploration, the work of collecting basic design data, selecting factory sites, and compiling design task books has been completed, and they are currently being designed and will soon begin construction one after another.
    Judging from the actual production status of the enterprises that have been put into production and the design documents that have been submitted to our country, it proves that the designs undertaken and the equipment supplied by the Soviet Union are technologically the most advanced and perfect. It is precisely because of the Soviet Union's systematic and selfless assistance, coupled with our own efforts to learn, that it is possible for us to gradually transform from a technologically very backward country into a country capable of mastering the latest technologies in the near future.
    In order to help our country carry out economic construction, for five years, the Soviet government has not only undertaken the arduous tasks of design and equipment supply, but also dispatched a large number of experts to our country to introduce the advanced experience of Soviet socialist construction and to specifically help and guide us in carrying out various economic tasks, especially industrial construction work. All the experts sent to our country not only possess exquisite scientific and technological knowledge and rich practical work experience, but also possess a high degree of internationalist spirit and a selfless working attitude. In various departments of our country such as industry, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, railways, transportation, post and telecommunications, construction, education, and geological exploration, they have loyally and selflessly contributed their experience, knowledge, and skills without reservation, and they regard our country's great cause of building socialism as their own cause. It should be said that every important achievement in our economic construction is in fact inseparable from the guidance and assistance of Soviet experts. Soviet experts have also made great contributions to the training of our country's technical personnel. Their communist labor attitude and their conscientious and modest work style have become models for the vast number of workers, peasants, technicians, and economic workers in our country to learn from.
    In terms of training technical personnel in our country, the number of students and interns sent by our country to study in the Soviet Union has been increasing year by year, which is extremely important for mastering modern industrial technology and ensuring the start-up production of newly built industries.
    In the process of restoring and developing our national economy, the development of Sino-Soviet trade also plays an important role. According to the materials of the State Statistical Bureau, the total value of import and export trade between China and the Soviet Union in 1954 has increased to four times that of 1950. It is particularly worth pointing out that the vast majority of the materials imported by our country from the Soviet Union are means of production such as complete sets of equipment, machinery, tools, and raw materials that are necessary for expanding our country's industrial base and cannot be obtained from capitalist markets. This new trade relationship based on friendly mutual assistance has accelerated the process of our country's economic restoration and construction, especially the process of our country's industrial construction.
    From the development of Sino-Soviet economic cooperation over the past five years and all the facts of Soviet assistance to our country in carrying out socialist construction, the Chinese people have personally experienced the following passage that Stalin said when discussing the economic cooperation between the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries in the post-war period: "The experience of this cooperation shows that no capitalist country can give the people's democratic countries the kind of genuine help and technically sophisticated help that the Soviet Union can. The problem is not only that this help is extremely cheap and technically first-rate. The problem is primarily that the basis of this cooperation is a sincere desire for mutual help and the pursuit of common economic advancement. As a result, there has been a high level of industrial development in these countries." The rapid restoration and development of our country's economy, especially the rapid restoration and development of our country's industry, over the past five years have fully confirmed Stalin's above-mentioned argument.
    As we commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance today, we deeply thank the great Soviet people for the fraternal assistance they have given to our country, we fully understand the important role that this assistance from the Soviet people plays in accelerating our country's socialist construction, and we must make a hundredfold effort to build our country. At the same time, we are also soberly aware that the aggressive American imperialists are not only occupying our country's Taiwan and coastal islands, but are also stepping up the implementation of the "policy of strength," creating a tense situation, and recently have even been so shameless as to openly threaten us with war. In order to stop the criminal aggressive activities of American imperialism, we will further strengthen and develop the great alliance between China and the Soviet Union, strengthen the unbreakable friendship between the people of China and the Soviet Union, so as to consolidate peace in the Far East and the world and defend the socialist construction of the motherland.

    苏联的无私援助是我国胜利地建设社会主义的重要保证
　　——为纪念中苏友好同盟互助条约五周年而作
    国务院副总理  国家计划委员会主任  李富春
    中苏友好同盟互助条约签订已经五周年了。这是中苏两大兄弟国家的亲密友谊和互助合作日益巩固和日益发展的五年。五年来的历史事实无可辩驳地证明：中苏两国的伟大同盟是保障远东和世界和平与安全的最有力的因素，这个同盟的日益巩固和日益发展，使美帝国主义在东方和西方所进行的挑动战争、奴役人类的一切罪恶企图已遭到了而且还要遭到可耻的失败。五年来的历史事实又完全证明：根据中苏友好同盟互助条约和中苏两国之间有关的协定，苏联政府和人民给予我国的真诚无私的巨大援助，对于迅速地恢复和发展我国国民经济，对于实现以社会主义工业化为中心的我国第一个五年计划，都具有极为重要的意义。
    当五年前中苏友好同盟互助条约签订的时候，我国面临的情况是：中华人民共和国还成立不久，帝国主义者千方百计地企图破坏和绞杀新生的人民中国；国内经过长期的战争，经济上受到了极大的破坏，而我们在管理复杂的经济事业特别是近代工业方面还缺乏经验。正是在这样的情况下，苏联政府和我国订立了友好同盟互助条约，给了我国以巨大的帮助。我们能够在巩固和加强以工人阶级为领导的工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的基础上，经过短短的三年时间，恢复了被长期战争所破坏的国民经济，并迅速地开始走上了有计划建设的道路，这是与苏联对我国的帮助不可分的。
    从一九五三年起，我国开始实行以社会主义工业化为中心的第一个五年计划。根据苏联建设社会主义的成功经验，为了实现我国的社会主义工业化，首先必须建设重工业。但是，大规模的工业建设、尤其是重工业建设，对于我国这样一个在经济上落后的国家来说，不可避免地是会遇到很多困难的。当时在经济建设方面摆在我们面前的主要困难是：资源不清，技术落后，并且缺乏经验，而苏联的援助，对于克服上述的困难，起了巨大的作用。
    一九五三年五月，由于我国的请求，经过中苏两国政府的商谈，苏联政府决定帮助我国新建和改建一百四十一项对于我国社会主义工业化具有决定意义的重要企业，其中包括现代化的钢铁联合企业、有色冶金企业、煤矿企业、石油企业、各类重型机器制造厂、汽车制造厂、拖拉机制造厂、飞机制造厂、电力站、化学工厂等。根据中苏两国政府签订的协定，这些企业将要在我国第一个五年计划期间内开始建设，其中大部分将要在一九五八年前后建成或部分建成并投入生产。在这些企业建成之后，我国的工业生产水平和技术水平将有极大的增长。我们就能够以更多的钢铁、煤炭、电力和有色金属制品、化学肥料来供应国民经济发展的需要。我国就能够制造我国历史上从来没有制造过的冶金设备、发电设备、矿山设备、采油设备、飞机、汽车和拖拉机等。总之，建设这些企业，就会从根本上改变我国经济落后的面貌，从而使我国向社会主义工业化这一伟大目标前进的道路上迈进一大步。建设这些企业，对于增强我国的经济力量和国防力量以建设社会主义，毫无疑问，具有极其重大的意义。
    一九五四年十月，在以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联政府代表团访问我国期间，中苏两国政府进行了会谈。会谈的结果，发表了关于中苏关系和国际形势各项问题的联合宣言、关于对日本关系的联合宣言、关于苏军自共同使用的中国旅顺口海军根据地撤退并将该根据地交由中华人民共和国完全支配的联合公报、关于将各股份公司中的苏联股份移交中华人民共和国的联合公报、关于签订科学技术合作协定的联合公报、关于修建兰州——乌鲁木齐——阿拉木图铁路并组织联运的联合公报和中苏蒙三国关于修建从集宁到乌兰巴托的铁路并组织联运的联合公报；此外，还签订了关于苏联政府帮助我国新建十五项工业企业和扩大原有协定规定的一百四十一项企业设备的供应范围的议定书。所有这些具有重大历史意义的文件，不仅再一次表示了中苏两国人民为进一步巩固和扩大两国之间的兄弟友谊、共同为保卫亚洲和世界的和平与安全而奋斗的决心，而且再一次表示了苏联政府和人民对于我国的社会主义建设事业的崇高的国际主义的关怀和援助。
    五年以来，苏联政府根据中苏友好同盟互助条约和苏联帮助我国发展国民经济的其他各项协定所给予我国的各种援助，特别是帮助我国建设新的工业企业的援助，都是按照原定的计划进行的。截至一九五四年底，在苏联帮助我国新建和改建的企业中，已经建成或部分建成投入生产的有十九个企业，其中包括鞍山钢铁公司的大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、薄板厂，阜新的海州露天矿等大的企业。正在进行施工的有三十四个企业；其余的企业，除个别煤矿因资源情况尚未完全弄清有待于进一步勘探外，都已完成了搜集设计基础资料、选择厂址和编制设计任务书等工作，目前正在进行设计，不久以后就将陆续开始施工。
    就已经投入生产的企业的实际生产状况和已经提交给我国的设计文件来看，证明苏联所承担的设计和所供应的设备，在技术上都是最先进和最完善的。正因为苏联这种系统的无私的援助，加上我们自己的努力学习，就有可能使我们在不久将来的时期内由一个技术上十分落后的国家逐步地转变为能够掌握最新技术的国家。
    为了帮助我国进行经济建设，五年来，苏联政府不仅承担了繁重的设计和设备供应的任务，而且派遣了大批的专家来我国，介绍苏联社会主义建设的先进经验，具体地帮助和指导我们进行各项经济工作，特别是工业建设工作。所有派来我国的专家，不仅具有精湛的科学技术知识和丰富的实际工作经验，而且具有高度的国际主义精神和忘我的劳动态度。他们在我国工业、农业、林业、水利、铁道、交通、邮电、建筑、教育以及地质勘察等各个部门中，忠诚无私地、毫无保留地将他们的经验、知识和技能贡献出来，他们把我国建设社会主义的伟大事业当作他们自己的事业一样看待。应该说，我们在经济建设中的每一项重要成就，事实上都是同苏联专家的指导和帮助分不开的。在培养我国的技术人材方面，苏联专家也作出了极大的贡献。他们那种共产主义的劳动态度和认真谦虚的工作作风，已经成为我国广大工人、农民、技术人员和经济工作干部学习的榜样。
    在为培养我国技术人员方面，我国派往苏联学习的留学生和实习生是逐年增长的，这对于掌握工业的近代技术和保证新建工业的开工生产是极关重要的。
    在恢复和发展我国国民经济的过程中，中苏两国贸易的发展也起着重要的作用。根据国家统计局的材料，中苏两国之间一九五四年的进出口贸易总额已经增长为一九五○年的四倍。这里特别值得指出的是：我国自苏联进口的物资中，绝大部分是为了扩大我国工业基础所必需而又不可能从资本主义市场取得的成套设备、机器、工具和原材料等生产资料。这种建立在友好互助基础上的新的贸易关系，加速了我国经济的恢复和建设过程，特别是加速了我国工业的建设过程。
    中国人民从五年来中苏两国经济合作的发展和苏联帮助我国进行社会主义建设的一切事实中，亲身体验了斯大林在论到战后时期苏联与各人民民主国家的经济合作时所说的下面一段话：“这个合作的经验表明，没有一个资本主义国家能够像苏联那样给予各人民民主国家以真正的帮助和技术精湛的帮助。问题不仅在于这种帮助是极度便宜的，技术上是头等的。问题首先在于这种合作的基础，是互相帮助和求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望。结果，在这些国家中便有了高度的工业发展。”五年来我国经济的迅速恢复和发展，特别是我国工业的迅速恢复和发展，充分地证实了斯大林的上述论点。
    当今天纪念中苏友好同盟互助条约五周年的时候，我们深深地感谢伟大的苏联人民给予我国的兄弟般的帮助，我们充分地理解苏联人民的这种帮助对加速我国社会主义建设所起的重要作用，我们必须百倍地努力来建设我们的国家。同时，我们还清醒地认识到：侵略成性的美国帝国主义者不仅侵占着我国的台湾和沿海岛屿，而且还在加紧推行“实力政策”，制造紧张局势，最近竟至于无耻到公开用战争来威胁我们。为了制止美国帝国主义罪恶的侵略活动，我们必将进一步加强和发展中苏之间的伟大同盟，加强中苏两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊，以巩固远东和世界的和平，保卫祖国的社会主义建设。
