Xinhua News Agency, New York, February 1st: TASS reported that the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States issued a statement to the press, stating that Claude Lightfoot, a staff member of the Communist Party in Chicago, was convicted for being a Communist, because Eugene Dennis, General Secretary of the National Committee of the Communist Party of the United States, and other leaders of the Communist Party who were convicted in 1950 on the fabricated charge of "conspiracy to violently subvert the US government" are about to complete their sentences. Lightfoot's case shows that Dennis and other leaders of the Communist Party of the United States are in danger of being arrested and sentenced again after serving their sentences because they are Communists.

The statement said that this action is against the entire labor movement, against those who disagree with the military policies implemented by Wall Street, and against all those who are committed to peaceful coexistence. The statement called on Americans, regardless of political beliefs, to unite and jointly safeguard democratic rights.

    美共号召美国人民团结起来维护民主权利
    【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社纽约一日讯：美国共产党全国委员会向报界发表声明说，共产党芝加哥工作人员克洛德·莱弗特因为是共产党员而被判罪，这是因为一九五○年被根据捏造的“阴谋暴力颠覆美国政府”的罪名判罪的美国共产党全国委员会总书记尤金·丹尼斯和共产党其他领导人即将服刑期满。莱弗特的案件表明，丹尼斯和美国共产党其他领导人有因为他们是共产党员而在服刑期满后再次被逮捕和判刑的危险。
    声明说，这一行动是反对整个工人运动的，是针对那些不赞成华尔街所执行的军事政策的人们的，同时也是针对着一切致力于和平共处的人们的。声明号召美国人不分政治信仰，团结起来共同维护民主权利。
