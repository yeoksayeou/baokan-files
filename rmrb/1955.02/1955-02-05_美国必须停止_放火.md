The United States Must Stop "Setting Fires"
Hu Yaobang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League

The Chinese people will never invade other countries, but the Chinese people must liberate their sacred territory of Taiwan.

After the Chinese people victoriously liberated Yijiangshan Island, the American aggressor group is massively increasing troops in the Taiwan area. The invaders continue to "set fires" within our territory, yet they manipulate the United Nations to play the trick of a "ceasefire."

In order to occupy Taiwan for a long time, the invaders have expressed their "determination" to the whole world and warned people not to "underestimate" the power of the United States. The Chinese people, tempered by countless wars, never "underestimate" or "overestimate" the power of any enemy at any time. Since the Chinese people have never succumbed to any violence, of course, they will never be intimidated by any threats.

The Chinese people must eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and return Taiwan to the embrace of the motherland. There is no "ceasefire" issue at all between the Chinese people and the traitors. The Chinese people will never tolerate the traitors slaughtering and selling out the eight million Taiwan compatriots who are as close as flesh and blood. The Chinese people have the power to completely smash all attempts by the American aggressors to separate China's sacred territory.

The voices of the world concerned about peace in the Far East are getting louder and louder, and the power of the world's people to defend peace is getting greater and greater. If the United Nations is truly concerned about peace in the Far East, it must seriously discuss the Soviet Union's proposal regarding the issue of American aggression against China. Premier Zhou's reply to the Secretary-General of the United Nations precisely demonstrates the unwavering and solemn stance of the Chinese people.

Chinese youth have once again learned something from the conspiracy of the American aggressors, which is that "a robber is always a robber." Let us raise the sacred banner of patriotism even higher and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, contribute all our strength to the liberation of all the territories of our great motherland.

    美国必须停止“放火”
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记　胡耀邦
    中国人民决不侵略别的国家，但中国人民必须解放自己的神圣领土台湾。
    美国侵略集团在中国人民胜利解放一江山岛后，正在台湾地区大量增兵。侵略者继续在我们的国土内“放火”，偏偏却操纵联合国玩弄什么“停火”诡计。
    为了长期霸占台湾，侵略者已向全世界表示了“决心”，并且警告人们不要“低估”美国的力量。经过无数战争锻炼的中国人民，对任何敌人的力量，任何时候都不“低估”，也不“高估”。中国人民既然从来没有在任何暴力面前屈服过，当然永远也就不会为任何威胁所吓倒。
    中国人民一定要消灭蒋介石卖国集团，使台湾重归祖国的怀抱。中国人民与卖国贼之间根本不存在什么“停火”问题。中国人民决不能容忍卖国贼宰割和出卖八百万亲如骨肉的台湾同胞。美国侵略者割裂中国神圣领土的一切企图，中国人民有力量把它彻底粉碎。
    全世界关心远东和平的呼声愈来愈高，世界人民保卫和平的力量愈来愈大。联合国如果真正关心远东和平，就必须认真讨论苏联关于美国对中国侵略行为问题的提案。周总理给联合国秘书长的复电，正表现了中国人民的不可动摇的严正立场。
    中国青年又一次从美国侵略者的阴谋中学到了东西，这就是“强盗终究是强盗”。让我们更高地举起爱国主义的神圣大旗，在中国共产党领导下，为解放我们伟大祖国的全部国土贡献出全部力量。
