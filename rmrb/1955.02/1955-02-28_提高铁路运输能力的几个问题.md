    Since the start of the nation's First Five-Year Plan, railway transport volume has increased month by month, and national railway transport is already under strain. Is there still potential in national railway transport? Can it be further improved? This has become an urgent problem to solve. To study this issue, we conducted some investigations at the Tianjin and Zhengzhou Railway Administrations. After research, we have the following main insights:

    First, there is an ideological obstacle in how to improve transport capacity, which is a one-sided emphasis on objective difficulties and insufficient technical equipment. For example, Tianjin Station, which is located at a key point connecting Northeast, North, and South China, could not normally receive and dispatch trains for a long time, disrupting train operations within the Tianjin Railway Administration and seriously affecting the transport order of adjacent railway administrations such as Beijing, Jinan, and Jinzhou. Among the cadres, there were two different views on the reasons for the mainline blockage: one believed that it was mainly because the transport volume had exceeded the throughput capacity, and it was necessary to increase investment and expand technical equipment. The other believed that there were many problems in transport organization work such as marshalling schemes, daily work plans, and station yard operations. Which of these opinions was correct? At that time, no clear conclusion was reached. It was not until the end of last December that the responsible comrades of the Ministry of Railways and Soviet experts inspected the transport work of the Tianjin Railway Administration and clearly pointed out that to solve the mainline blockage problem at Tianjin Station, it was necessary to increase some technical equipment, but this was not the main factor. The main factor was that the Tianjin Railway Administration had serious shortcomings in transport organization work, and it was wrong to only hope to solve the problem by increasing technical equipment. By August of last year, the throughput capacity of Tianjin Station had increased by 60 percent. Not only was there no mainline blockage, but everyone believed that even more transport tasks would not cause a mainline blockage. Why was this possible? The most important reason was that the Tianjin Railway Administration strengthened the adjustment of marshalling schemes throughout the entire administration, and other technical stations shared part of the workload of Tianjin Station. This proves the important role of strengthening transport organization work.

    In the Zhengzhou Transportation Section, there had long been a fear of military transport, heavy wind and rain, ferry crossings, and large traffic flows. Zhengzhou Station also emphasized three major difficulties: few arrival and departure lines, few marshalling lines, and few lead tracks. In Tianjin Station's shunting work, there was also a saying: "Few cars are easy to handle, many cars are chaotic." In loading work, there was a saying: "No work in the rain, half work in the wind." The above-mentioned various erroneous ideas that one-sidedly emphasize objective factors and technical equipment seriously affect the subjective efforts to tap potential and improve transport organization work to improve transport capacity. These ideas are widespread. Therefore, it must be taken seriously and efforts must be made to overcome them.

    Second, insufficient attention is paid to the improvement and utilization of existing equipment, and there is an idea of not proceeding from reality and waiting for large-scale technical equipment. Thanks to the implementation of Soviet experts' sixteen suggestions for improving equipment at Tianjin Station, the throughput capacity was considerably increased; however, the largest of these improvements were only the addition of one or two tracks to individual freight yards, the improvement and relocation of some turnouts, and the addition of some small-scale equipment that was indeed needed and required little investment. In the past, the Tianjin Railway Administration underestimated these easy and highly efficient technical improvement measures; they only hoped to increase technical equipment on a large scale, but ignored the improvement and utilization of the existing equipment at Tianjin Station.

    Third, there is still great potential in the determination of equipment capacity. Taking Tianjin Station as an example, the capacity determined from January to June 1954 was based on the rather backward indicators of the winter of 1953, so the determined capacity was conservative. Some people shouted: "The capacity has reached its maximum!" This is obviously wrong. For example, the throughput capacity between Tianjin and Dezhou was originally determined to be a maximum of 28.5 pairs of trains, but it reached 34 pairs during the flood season.

    Fourth, judging from the completion of the vehicle turnaround time, there is also great potential. In particular, various indicators are generally set too loosely, and the indicators for dwell time are also too loose. For example, in March, April, May, and June of last year, Tianjin Station's completion greatly exceeded the plan, and the plan was always lagging behind the actual situation, causing the indicator to lose its progressive and guiding significance and become the tail of the actual situation, so it was impossible to guarantee the completion of the annual plan.

    Fifth, there is also a great waste in locomotive utilization, which is manifested in two aspects: First, the locomotive operation routes are chaotic, the locomotive's capacity is not fully utilized, and there is a great waste. For example, in the first ten days of March last year alone, the Tianjin Branch suspended 33 inbound and outbound trains and added 26 trains, wasting a total of 58.39 hours, equivalent to 2.4 locomotive days. Therefore, the phenomenon of locomotives leaving the depot too early and waiting for marshalling or waiting for operation lines to start on time occurs. Some locomotives have to wait for four to six hours after leaving the depot, and some are even as serious as "three exits and three entries." Second, there is excessive single-engine travel. For example, the Tianjin Branch has an average of more than ten unnecessary single-engine runs per month. In addition, in order to complete the daily car-kilometer indicators and compensate for shortcomings in operation work, locomotive crew members who should be given time off are not given time off, and exceeding working hours has become a relatively common phenomenon. In June last year alone, there were 1,254 hours of overtime. Generally, the working time exceeded by about 4.5 hours, and the most extreme case was continuous work for 23 hours, which affected the crew members' health, work efficiency, and safety.

    Sixth, the daily work plan is a weak link in the current transport organization work. The waste in locomotive and vehicle utilization mentioned above is mainly caused by incorrect daily plans.

    The reasons for the incorrect daily work plan, in addition to insufficient investigation and understanding of freight sources and freight flows, are mainly the following: 1. Due to incorrect forecast and confirmation reports. Forecast and confirmation reports are like intelligence in combat. If the intelligence is incorrect, of course there will be no correct combat plan. According to statistics from the Tianjin Branch, the current forecast accuracy rate is only 70 to 80 percent between the Tianjin Branch and the Jinan Railway Administration, and only 20 to 30 percent between the Fengtai and Guye Branches. 2. Due to the inability to grasp the current car situation. To make a good plan, it is necessary to clarify the situation of what cars are on site and where they are going, but generally this cannot be grasped. 3. There are still many shortcomings in the organization and implementation of the daily plan. For example, the station technical operation process table is a mirror reflecting the station's work and a tool for completing the daily plan, but marshalling stations in the Tianjin and Zhengzhou Railway Administrations generally fail to fill in the items of the technical operation table in a timely manner. The marshalling plan is the basis for formulating the daily plan, but there are also many violations of the marshalling plan. The train operation diagram is also one of the bases for formulating the daily plan, but the bad practice of not operating according to the operation diagram and mutually抢 eighteen points between railway administrations and between branches is still very serious. It causes serious operational chaos and imbalances, making it impossible to fulfill the daily plan. This practice is actually transferring one's own shortcomings in work to other bureaus in order to improve one's own performance, which is a bourgeois individualistic ideology. Railway transport is a national linkage, and localism in one place will soon affect the whole country. Therefore, it must be resolutely opposed. Fixed use of lines is one of the important measures to implement the daily plan. However, at present, this principle is generally violated, and arrival lines are often used as holding lines, departure lines are used as assembly lines, and sometimes arrival/departure lines are used as marshalling lines, and marshalling lines are used as arrival/departure lines, causing extreme confusion in the use of lines. The result of misusing lines is confusion in shunting operations, reduced work efficiency, and a tendency to accidents, because the railway is a very complex linkage; therefore, to implement the daily plan, it is necessary to rely on the coordination and cooperation of all parties, and mutual care.

    The daily work plan is an action plan that directs the car, locomotive, engineering, electrical, and commercial departments to complete the national transportation tasks every day and every hour, and it is also the main basis for railway planning management. However, judging from the above facts, the daily work plan is a weak link. The main reason why it has become a weak link is ideological problems, such as the many irresponsible and localistic ideas mentioned earlier, which are obviously inconsistent with the socialist planned management ideology.

    Seventh, the current low level of professional and technical skills of railway employees has become an obstacle to the development of the railway transport industry. The main reasons for the many shortcomings in transportation work are, of course, the problems in ideological understanding and working methods, but it is also an important reason that the professional and technical skills of employees cannot keep up with the needs of the development of the transportation industry. According to the situation in the Tianjin Railway Administration, 40 percent of the employees who joined the railway work from 1949 after the liberation to the end of 1953 were new employees. Due to too many new components, especially the short period of time in their current positions, the technical and professional level of employees is very low. For example, in the Tianjin Vehicle Depot, there are more than 600 workers, of whom 200 failed the exam. In the entire railway administration, only 5 percent of the locomotive crew members passed the fitter technology exam, and drivers who meet the first and second-class technology standards only account for 9 percent of all drivers. Most of the engineering cadres were promoted from track maintenance workers, with high enthusiasm, anxious, and doing everything themselves, but with few methods. Some technical section chiefs dare not go to the station, fearing being asked questions they cannot answer and losing face. Some station masters are not familiar with receiving and dispatching trains and cannot calculate train running times and train intervals, resulting in abnormal train operation and frequent accidents. Some new dispatchers feel a headache and dare not sit at the table to direct traffic when they see a messy operation diagram after starting work, and they take sick leave. Some trade union and political cadres cannot even figure out the most basic common sense of railways. The leading cadres of the railway administration and branch also reflected: "We sometimes feel weak in our mouths and cannot stand up straight when directing work, mainly because we are not familiar with the business." The reasons why the professional and technical level of employees cannot keep up with the needs of the development of the transportation industry, in addition to the large number of employee transfers over the years, many new components, tight staffing, and few reserve rates, the more important thing is that the leadership has not yet realized that the professional and technical level of employees has fallen behind the development of the transportation industry, and has not realized that in the entire national economic development, it is necessary to carry out large-scale technical transformation of operating lines, and it is necessary to build a large number of new lines, and at the same time, it is also necessary to have a large number of people who master new technologies. If we do not start now to put forward the issue of mastering business and technology as a political task, and vigorously mobilize cadres and make solid achievements, then in the near future, this issue will inevitably become an obstacle to the development of the railway industry.

    In short, in order to meet the transportation needs put forward with the development of the national economy, it is necessary and certain to carry out planned and step-by-step technical transformation of China's railways, but it is also necessary and certain, and should be the main aspect, to strengthen transportation organization work, make full use of existing technical equipment, and earnestly tap potential. In 1954, it was proposed on the railway to strengthen transportation organization work as the central task. Over the past year, the work has improved a step, but there has been no fundamental change. In the future, this central task should continue to be implemented. From the perspective that the daily work plan is a weak link in the current transportation organization work, we believe that it should be clearly defined that the daily work plan is the center of transportation organization work. Secondly, in order to ensure the successful completion of this central task, it is necessary to wage a resolute struggle against bourgeois ideology, especially conservative ideology, in the railway system. Stalin once said: "For example, take the People's Commissariat of Railways. Not long ago, in the central organs of this People's Commissariat, there were some professors, engineers, and other experts, including communists, who insisted that a freight car speed of 13 to 14 kilometers per hour was a limit, and that exceeding this limit would be willingly violating 'business studies'. This was a highly authoritative group of people who advocated their views verbally and in publications, and issued various instructions to the organs under the People's Commissariat of Railways, and they were fundamentally the 'ideological authorities' among railway business personnel. Although we are not experts in railway affairs, we have also advised these authoritative professors, based on the suggestions of many practical workers in the railway field, that a speed of 13 to 14 kilometers per hour should not be regarded as a limit; when the work is organized properly, it is possible to exceed this limit. But not only did they not listen to the call of this experience and practice and change their attitude, but they desperately opposed the progressive elements in the railway field and intensified the propaganda of those conservative views. Of course, we had to gently strike these respected figures and politely ask them to leave the central organs of the People's Commissariat of Railways. (Applause) What was the result? Our current freight car speed is already 18 to 19 kilometers per hour." ("Speech at the First All-Union Stakhanovite Workers' Conference"). Such conservative ideological viewpoints as Stalin said are present in our railway system and should be cleared in time. It is necessary to criticize the three main erroneous ideas of "non-planned thinking," "localism," and "irresponsibility," so that everyone knows that this kind of thinking is an obstacle to the road to socialism.

    提高铁路运输能力的几个问题
    剑心
    国家开始第一个五年计划以来，铁路运量逐月上涨，全国铁路运输已呈紧张状态。全国铁路运输是不是还有潜力？是不是还能提得更高？就成为一个迫切需要解决的问题。为了研究这个问题，我们曾到天津、郑州两局作了一些调查工作，经研究后，有以下的几点主要体会：
    第一、在如何提高运输能力上存在着片面的强调客观困难，强调技术设备不足的思想障碍。比如处于东北和北方、南方咽喉地位的天津车站，很长时间不能正常接发列车，使天津铁路管理局内的列车运行紊乱，严重地影响到北京、济南、锦州等邻接路局的运输秩序。干部中对满线堵塞的原因，有两种不同的认识：一种认为主要是由于运量已超过了通过能力，必须增加投资，扩大技术设备。另一种认为主要是编组方案、日班计划、站场作业等运输组织工作方面有很多问题。这两种意见，谁是谁非？当时没有得到明确的结论，一直到去年十二月底，铁道部的负责同志和苏联专家检查了天津铁路管理局的运输工作后，明确指出：要解决天津站的满线堵塞问题，增加某些技术设备，是必要的，但不是主要的，主要的是天津铁路管理局在运输组织工作方面存在着严重的缺点，只希望从增加技术设备上解决问题是错误的。到去年八月，天津车站的通过能力提高百分之六○，不但没有满线堵塞，而且大家认为再多一些运输任务也不致于满线，为什么能这样呢？最主要的是由于天津局在全局加强了编组方案的调整工作，由其他技术站分担了天津站一部分作业量。这证明了加强运输组织工作的重要作用。
    在郑州车务处，长期存在着怕军运，怕大风雨，怕轮渡，怕车流大等思想，郑州车站还强调三大困难：到发线少，编组线少，牵出线少。在天津车站调车工作上也流传着“车少好干，车多就乱”；在装车工作上流传着“下雨全无，刮风减半”。上述各种片面的强调客观强调技术设备的错误思想，都严重的影响着从主观努力上去挖掘潜力，改进运输组织工作，以提高运输能力。这些思想，是带有普遍性的。因此必须引起重视，设法克服。
    第二、对现有设备的改善利用重视不够，有不从现实出发和等待大规模技术设备的思想。天津车站由于执行了苏联专家对天津车站十六项改善设备的建议，对提高通过能力起了相当作用；但是这些改善，最大的工程只是个别货场增设一条半条股道，和某些道岔的改善和改移，以及一些投资不大而确实需要的零星设备的增加。对于这种轻而易举、效率很高的技术改善措施，过去天津局是估计不足的；他们只希望大规模地增加技术设备，却忽视了对天津站现有设备的改善利用。
    第三、在设备能力的查定上还有很大的潜力。拿天津车站来说，一九五四年一月份到六月份所查定的能力，是根据一九五三年冬季时相当落后的指标进行的，因而所查定的能力是保守的，有些人叫喊：“能力已达最大限度！”显然是错误的。又如天津、德州间的通过能力，原查定最高能力为二八·五对，但在水害期间已到达了三十四对。
    第四、从车辆周转时间这一指标的完成情况来看，也还有很大的潜力。特别是各种指标一般的都定得过宽，停留时间方面指标也给的过宽。如天津站去年三月、四月、五月、六月份，完成情况都大大超过计划，计划始终落后于实际，使指标失掉了他的进步性和指导意义，变成了实际的尾巴，因此也无法保证年度计划的完成。
    第五、在机车运用方面也有很大的浪费，这表现在两方面：一是机车运行交路混乱，没有充分发挥机车的能力，浪费很大。如天津分局仅去年三月上旬上下行列车就停运三三列，加开二六列，共浪费五八·三九小时，折合机车二·四台日。因此就发生机车过早出库，等待编组或等运行线不能正点开车的现象，机车出库后有的要等四个到六个钟头，甚至有的则严重到“三出三入”。二是单机走行多。如天津分局每月不应有的对放单机的事情平均有十多次。此外，为了完成日车公里指标，和弥补运行工作上的缺点，对机车乘务员应调休的不调休，超过劳动时间成了较普遍的现象。只去年六月一个月就有一、二五四小时。一般劳动时间超过者约为四·五小时，最多者有达连续工作二十三小时的，影响了乘务员的身体健康及工作效率和安全。
    第六、日班作业计划是目前运输组织工作中的薄弱环节。前面所说的机车车辆运用上的浪费，主要是由于日班计划不正确所造成的。
    日班作业计划不正确的原因，除了货源货流的调查了解工作做的不够外，主要的还有以下几点：1、由于预确报不正确。预确报如同作战的情报一样，情报不正确当然就不会有正确的作战计划。据天津分局统计目前预报情况，除天津分局与济南局相互间都能达到百分之七十到八十的正确外，和丰台、古冶两分局相互之间只能达到百分之二十到三十的正确程度。2、由于现在车掌握不住。要作好计划，必须把现场有些什么车，到什么地方去的等情况弄清楚，但现在一般的都掌握不住。3、组织贯彻日班计划的工作尚有很多缺点，比如：车站技术作业过程表是反映车站工作的一面镜子，是完成日班计划的工具，但天津、郑州两局的编组站一般的都未能按照技术作业表的项目及时填写。编组计划是制定日班计划的根据，但违反编组计划的情况也很多。列车运行图也是制定日班计划的根据之一，但管理局与管理局之间，分局与分局之间，不按运行图行车，互抢十八点的恶劣现象仍十分严重。它造成了严重的运行紊乱和不平衡，造成日班计划无法兑现。这种做法实际上是把自己工作上的缺点转嫁于他局，以提高自己成绩的一种资产阶级个人主义的思想。铁路运输是一个全国性的联动机，一个地方的本位主义，很快就会波及全国。因此必须坚决反对。固定使用线路是贯彻日班计划重要措施之一。但是目前一般的都违反了这个原则，常常把到达线作为停留线，把出发线作为集结线，也有时把到发线作为编组线，把编组线作为到发线，造成线路使用极度混乱。乱用线路的结果，是造成调车作业上的混乱，降低工作效率，容易发生事故，因为铁路是一个很复杂的联动机；所以要贯彻日班计划，必须靠各方面的协调一致，互相照顾。
    日班计划是每日每时指挥着车、机、工、电、商各部门完成国家运输任务的行动计划，也是铁路计划管理的主要基础。但是从上述种种事实来看，日班计划工作是一个薄弱环节。它所以成为一个薄弱环节，主要原因是思想问题，如前面所说过的许多不负责任和本位主义思想，很明显的这与社会主义计划管理的思想是不符的。
    第七、目前铁路员工业务技术水平不高，成了铁路运输事业发展的一个障碍。运输工作上发生许多缺点的主要原因，当然是思想认识和工作方法上存在着问题，但员工业务技术水平赶不上运输事业发展的需要，也是重要原因之一。根据天津局的情况，该局从一九四九年解放后到一九五三年底，新参加铁路工作的员工，占全体职工的百分之四○。由于新成份太多，特别是担任现职的时期太短，因此职工的技术业务水平很低。如天津车辆段，一共有六○○多工人，其中就有二○○人考试不及格。全局机车乘务员考试钳工技术，只有百分之五及格，够一、二等技术的司机只占全部司机的百分之九。工务干部大多数是养路工中提拔的，热情很高，干着急，什么事情多亲自动手，但办法很少。有的技术股长不敢到车站去，怕给人问住不好看。有些站长对接发列车不熟悉，不会计算列车运行时分和列车间隔时间，致使列车运行不正常、屡出事故。某些新的调度人员，一上班看见运行图很乱，就头痛，不敢坐台子指挥行车，托病告假。有些工会及政治干部连铁路最起码的常识都弄不清。局和分局的领导干部也反映：“我们有时候也感到嘴软，指挥工作挺不起腰来，主要是由于不熟悉业务的关系”。员工业务技术水平所以赶不上运输事业发展的需要，除了历年来职工调动大，新成份多，定员紧，预备率少等种种原因外，更重要的是从领导上还没有认识到员工业务技术水平已经落在运输事业发展的后面，没有认识到在整个国民经济的发展中，必须对营业线路进行大规模的技术改造，必须建设大量新线的时候，同时还需要大量掌握新技术的人，如果我们不从现在就开始把精通业务技术问题作为政治任务提出，大张旗鼓的号召动员干部，踏踏实实的作出成绩来，那么不久的将来，这问题必然成为铁路事业发展的障碍。
    总之，为了满足随着国民经济的发展所提出的运输需要，对我国铁路进行有计划有步骤的技术改造，这是必须的、肯定的，但是加强运输组织工作，充分利用现有技术设备认真挖掘潜力，也是必须的、肯定的，而且应该是主要的一面。一九五四年在铁路上提出以加强运输组织工作为中心工作，一年来，使工作提高了一步，但是还没有根本改观。今后还应该继续贯彻这一中心工作。从日班作业计划是当前运输组织工作的薄弱环节上来看，我们认为又应明确以日班作业计划为运输组织工作的中心。其次，为了保证这一中心工作的胜利完成，在铁路系统中必须向资产阶级思想特别是保守思想作坚决斗争。斯大林曾说过：“例如拿铁路人民委员部来说吧。不久以前，在这个人民委员部中央机关里，有一些教授、工程师以及其他专家，其中也有共产党员，硬说每小时十三至十四公里的货车驶行速率已是一种界限，超出这个界限，便是甘愿违背
  ‘营业学’了。这是颇有威信的一部分人，他们在口头上和刊物上鼓吹自己的观点，并向铁路人民委员部所属各机关发出种种训令，而且他们根本就是铁路营业人员中间的‘思想权威’。我们虽不是铁路事业专家，但我们根据铁路事业方面许多实际工作人员底建议，也奉劝过这些有威信的教授们说：十三至十四公里的速率，决不能当作一种界限；在工作组织得当时，是可以越出这个界限的。但他们不仅没有来倾听这种经验和实践底呼声和改变态度，反而拚命反对铁路事业方面的进步分子，更加紧宣传那些保守主义观点。当然，我们只好把这些受人尊敬的人物轻轻打击了一下，并客客气气的请他们离开了铁路人民委员部中央机关。（鼓掌）结果怎样呢？我们现有的货车驶行速率已经是每小时十八至十九公里了”（“在第一次全苏联斯达汉诺夫工作者会议上的演说”）。像斯大林所说的这种保守主义的思想观点，在我们铁路系统中是存在着的，应该及时加以清除。要对“非计划思想”、“本位主义”、“不负责”三种主要的错误思想进行批判，使大家都知道，这种思想是走向社会主义道路上的障碍。
