The U.S. government's embarrassment stems from the fact that "informer" Paul Crouch, hired by the U.S. government to frame leaders of the American Communist Party, admitted that his testimony in court was false. Because of Crouch's previous false testimony, thirteen leaders of the American Communist Party were convicted. On January 10 of this year, their appeal was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court, and they were immediately denied bail and re-arrested.

Crouch said in his confession: "When I testified in court in the case of the thirteen Communist leaders, the defense lawyer said: 'You are doing all this for dollars.' At the time, I denied it, but he was right." It is clear that Crouch was bribed and, under the instructions of the U.S. Department of Justice, falsely accused the Communist leaders. Crouch also admitted that his testimony in some other persecution cases was also false.

Crouch's scandalous confession forced the New York Federal Court to begin discussing the question of retrying the "case" of the thirteen leaders of the American Communist Party on February 10. Neither newspapers nor government agencies could remain silent about this confession.

American writer Albert Kahn, who is preparing to publish Crouch's book "The False Witness," appeared in court on February 11. Kahn refused to hand over to the court the documents related to the book. Kahn said that he was prepared to give all these documents to newspapers and the Senate Judiciary Committee, and that the book "contains material that seriously implicates the Department of Justice." He explained that the reason the court wanted these documents was that "the Department of Justice is trying to seize these documents so that they will not be made public."

Crouch's confession caused unease among the American ruling class. Senator Henry Jackson, a member of the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, expressed concern that Crouch's confession would make it difficult to persecute communists in the future and would expose the U.S. authorities' trick of hiring "false witnesses" to carry out persecution. Representative Francis Walter, chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee, demanded that Crouch be prosecuted immediately. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “假证人”的真供状
    美国政府雇用来陷害美国共产党领导人的“告密者”马图索承认他在法院的作证是假的这件事使美国政府陷入了狼狈的境地。由于马图索以前虚假的作证，美国共产党的十三个领导人被判了罪。今年一月十日，他们的上诉又被美国最高法院拒绝，并且立即被停止了保释，重新逮捕入狱。
    马图索在他的自白材料中说：“当我在法院对十三位共产党领袖一案作证的时候，辩护律师曾经说过：‘你是为了美元而干这一切的。’当时我否认这一点，但是他说的是对的。”很明显，马图索受到贿赂，他在美国司法部的指使下诬害共产党领袖。马图索还承认他在其他一些迫害案件中的作证也是假的。
    马图索的这一出丑供认，使纽约联邦法院不得不在二月十日开始讨论重审美国共产党十三个领袖的“案件”的问题。无论是报纸或者政府机关对这一供认都无法保持沉默了。
    正在准备把马图索所写的“假证人”一书出版的美国作家艾伯特·康恩在二月十一日曾经出庭。康恩拒绝把同这本书有关的文件交给法庭。康恩说，他准备把所有这些文件交给报纸和参议院司法委员会，并且说这本书“包含的材料严重地牵连到司法部”。他解释说，法院所以要这些文件，原因就在于“司法部企图掌握这些文件，使它不公开出去。”
    马图索的供认引起了美国统治集团的不安。参议院国内安全小组委员会委员亨利·杰克逊表示担心马图索的自白会为将来迫害共产党人造成困难，会使人识破美国当局雇用“假证人”来进行迫害的伎俩。众议院非美活动委员会主席弗兰西斯·华尔特要求赶快对马图索提起控诉。（新华社）
