[This newspaper dispatch] In Shanghai, Xi'an, Hunan, Xinjiang, Xikang, Qinghai, Guangxi, Heilongjiang and other provinces and cities, the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons is being widely launched.

    The signature campaign of the people of Shanghai against the use of atomic weapons is being carried out on a large scale and is gradually penetrating into basic-level organizations such as government offices, factories, schools, neighborhoods, and shops. On the 16th, another 270,157 people in the city participated in the signature campaign. Together with the figures for the 14th and 15th, a total of 373,707 people in the city have participated in the signature campaign. On the 16th, employees from 84 factories, students from 6 universities and 4 secondary technical schools, and employees from 15 state-owned companies participated in the signature campaign. These signing units all held signature rallies against the use of atomic weapons. At Shanghai Railway Station and along the Huangpu River, passengers going to other places also signed the "Appeal to the People of the World" in an endless stream. Fishermen of the Shanghai Aquatic Products Company, who are fishing on the ocean, also enthusiastically signed their names.

    The Xi'an Municipal People's Committee Against the Use of Atomic Weapons Signature Campaign was established on the 12th. On the 14th, signature campaign committees were established in various districts of Xi'an to organize and lead the signature campaign in their respective districts, and signature points were set up in stations and hotels in the districts to facilitate signatures from passing travelers. All cinemas, cultural centers, cultural stations, blackboard newspapers, and reading groups in the city will launch publicity activities. On the same day, some provincial and municipal-level government offices and factories launched mass signature campaigns.

    The signature campaign in Hunan against the use of atomic weapons is taking shape as a broad mass movement. On the 14th, more than 2,800 employees of the Changsha Machine Tool Plant and Yuxiang Textile Factory held separate rallies. When the Changsha Machine Tool Plant held its meeting, in addition to the enthusiastic attendance of the day-shift workers, the night-shift workers also took advantage of breaks during their work to rush to participate in the meeting. More than 1,300 representatives of young people from all walks of life in Changsha held a meeting, and 11 representatives spoke at the meeting, unanimously supporting the use of atomic energy for peaceful construction and opposing the use of atomic energy for war. After all the representatives signed their names one by one, they shouted slogans such as resisting aggression, defending peace, and resolutely liberating Taiwan. More than 100 outstanding members of the Communist Youth League, who had just finished attending a meeting in Changsha to commend outstanding League members, immediately gathered for a signature campaign. The people of Xiangtan, Zhuzhou, and Hengyang are also launching signature campaigns.

    The Xikang Provincial Committee Against the Use of Atomic Weapons Signature Campaign was established on the 16th. The committee is composed of 29 people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life, including Zhang Weijiong, Guoji Mugu (Yi), and Riku (Tibetan). Starting from that day, the signature campaign in Xikang Province will be launched successively in Han Chinese populated areas, Tibetan autonomous regions on the Kangzang Plateau, Yi autonomous regions in the Daliang Mountains, and areas where ethnic groups live together.

    The Xinjiang Province and Urumqi City People's Committee Against the Use of Atomic Weapons Signature Campaign were established in Urumqi on the 15th. At the meeting of the Urumqi Signature Campaign Committee, a specific plan for carrying out the signature campaign was formulated. It requires that the campaign first be launched in government offices, factories, enterprises, organizations, and schools, and at the same time, it calls on people of all ethnic groups to actively participate in this campaign.

    The Qinghai Province People of All Ethnic Groups Committee Against the Use of Atomic Weapons Signature Campaign was established in Xining City on the 15th. The 29 people participating in the committee included representatives of Han, Hui, Tu, Tibetan, and Salar ethnic groups.

    In Heilongjiang Province, except for the Heihe area, all cities and counties have generally established committees against the use of atomic weapons and have convened the first meeting to study and arrange the work of carrying out the signature campaign. On the first day of the signature campaign, 15,000 people signed in Harbin City, 1,500 people signed in Jiamusi City, and 960 people signed in Lalin County.
