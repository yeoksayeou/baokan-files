Due to the lack of uniform specifications and poor quality of some building materials, many difficulties have been brought to basic construction work, causing great waste to the country.

Taking plumbing and heating materials alone, there are more than two thousand commonly used specifications in engineering. The specifications manufactured by various regions and factories are mostly different. For example, due to inconsistent interfaces and diameters of radiator fins, products from different factories cannot be mixed and matched into groups. Sometimes when the construction site needs to be reorganized or processed, it is difficult to match parts. Some may not be needed on the construction site, or maybe there aren’t enough. Asking the manufacturer, they may not give it, or it may not be delivered in time. These seemingly small problems cause many staff to run back and forth, even causing minor work stoppages on the construction site. Cast iron double-disc pipes and their accessories are also different from each other and cannot be connected. Cast iron spigot pipes and their accessories often cause work stoppages during construction due to mismatched eyelets and inaccurate diameters. Especially after the construction site implements a piece-rate wage system and launches labor competitions, such things will cause a lot of disputes. The construction site blames the material requisition clerk for being irresponsible, and the material requisition clerk blames the supply department for being irresponsible. After all the blaming, the material is still unusable.

Some material quality standards cannot keep up with the requirements of engineering development. For example, most projects in 1953 used steam heating, while projects using hot water heating and high-rise buildings increased in 1954, but the production departments still produced according to the 1953 standards. As a result, many construction sites using this type of radiator have serious water leaks. The construction site requires the supply department to be responsible for the losses, and the supply department negotiates with the manufacturing plant, which takes a long time to resolve, affecting the smooth progress of the project, ultimately resulting in losses for the country.

Many materials are also made very roughly. For example, some valve screws have only three threads, and the outer skin is very thin. Some cannot be tightened with the pipe, and some break when tightened. Even if they are barely tightened at the time, the pipeline is likely to break due to thermal expansion and contraction in the future. A batch of electrical conduit pipes produced in Shanghai looked fine on the surface, but crumbled when bent during use. Another example is the pull rod in the high water tank in the toilet, which is just a small flat iron one centimeter wide and one millimeter thick, with three holes on it. It is used to frequently pull more than ten kilograms of water pressure and is easily broken.

The above are just a few examples. Plumbing and electrical materials are mostly metal products and very valuable. There are often three to four thousand specifications coming in and out, and almost none can be smoothly accepted into storage or supplied out. The main reason is that the specifications of products from various factories are not uniform, inaccurate, and the product quality is not guaranteed.

When materials enter the warehouse, although strict acceptance is required to pick out the bad ones, this does not mean that the proportion of inferior products in the country's total production has decreased; nor does it mean that a series of losses caused by inferior products has been stopped. In fact, a warehouse cannot have enough inspectors to test the pressure and measure the specifications of batches of thousands of materials one by one, inspecting each one thoroughly. Therefore, relying on warehouse acceptance to ensure material quality is already too late and not a fundamental solution. At the same time, the manufacturing plant may not take back all the materials that are picked out for remelting and rework, but may sell them to another unit. As a result, they are either still used in engineering, damaging the quality of national projects; or they are stockpiled, occupying funds for a long time.

Based on the above-mentioned situations, I suggest:

One, material specifications should be gradually unified. Local administrative organs should first convene technical research meetings of their subordinate factories to jointly discuss solutions. Then, regions should exchange opinions with each other to seek broader unification. In the discussion, the opinions of design units and material usage units should be absorbed.

Two, production departments should often take the initiative to understand the development of projects, learn about the quality requirements of materials from design departments, and solicit opinions from user departments, so as to continuously improve quality and meet needs. Never assume that the sales contract has been signed and that there is already an owner, and then fail to pay attention to improving quality.

Three, production units must have a strict quality inspection system during the production process, and only products that meet the standards can leave the factory. Do not irresponsibly release products just to get things done. The quality, specifications, and factory name of the product should be accompanied by instructions to facilitate receipt, dispatch, storage, and use.

Four, quantitative packaging and careful storage are required. Now some copper hardware parts are only wrapped in newspapers in a scattered manner. During transportation and distribution, at least 20% will be lost due to compression and friction, which is much greater than the value of the crate.

### 建筑材料的规格应该统一，质量应该改善

    建筑材料的规格应该统一，质量应该改善
    庞亚夫
    由于有些建筑材料的规格不统一，质量不好，给基本建设工作带来了很多困难，给国家造成了很大的浪费。
    单以水暖材料来说，工程上常用的规格就有两千种以上。各个地区各个工厂制造的规格多不一样。如暖气片由于接口和口径等不一致，不同工厂的出品就不能混合成组。有时工地需要改组或加工时，零件就很不好配。工地有的也许用不上，也许不够。向生产厂要，也许不给，也许不能及时拿来。为了这些看起来不太大的问题，却使得很多工作人员往返奔跑，甚至引起工地的小停工。铸铁双盘管及其附件，也是一家一样，不能相接。铸铁承插的管子及其附件，因口径不准，常在施工中途因眼孔不合而停工。特别是工地实行计件工资制和开展劳动竞赛以后，碰到这种事情就会引起很多争执，工地怪领料员不负责任，领料员怪供应部门不负责任，怪来怪去，材料仍然是不能用。
    还有些材料质量标准赶不上工程发展的要求。如一九五三年的工程多采用蒸汽采暖，一九五四年用热水采暖的工程和高层建筑物增加了，但是生产部门仍旧按一九五三年的标准生产。结果很多工地使用这种暖气片，都严重地漏水。工地要求供应部门负责损失费，供应部门又和生产厂交涉，弄得很长时间不能解决，影响工程不能顺利进行，最后都是国家的损失。
    还有很多材料做得非常粗糙。如有些汽门上的螺丝口只有三扣，外皮又很薄，有的和管子拧不住，有的一拧就破裂。即使当时勉强拧上了，日后管道遇冷热伸缩也很容易破裂。上海生产的一批电线管子，从外表上看一点也看不出毛病，可是使用时一折弯就酥裂了。再如厕所中高水箱里的拉杆，仅仅是一公分宽一公厘厚的小扁铁，上面还有三个孔，用它要经常拉动十多公斤重的水压力，很容易折断。
    上面只是举了几个例子。水电材料多是金属品，价值很贵，经常有三、四千种规格出入，几乎没有一样能够顺利地验收进来，顺利地供应出去。主要就是因为各厂产品的规格不统一，不正确，产品质量没有保证。
    材料入库时，虽然要严格验收，把不好的挑剔出去。但是，这不等于国家的生产总额中减少了劣品；更不等于制止了由于劣品而造成的一系列的损失。实际上在一个仓库里也不能有足够的验收员，把一批一批成千成万的材料，一个一个的去试压、量规格，每一个都检查周到。所以靠仓库验收来保证材料质量已经晚了，不是根本办法。同时生产厂对被挑剔出去的材料，不见得都能拿回去回炉重做，也许又推销给另一个单位。结果不是仍旧使用到工程上去，损害着国家的工程质量；便是积压着，长期占用着资金。
    根据上面所说的种种情况，我建议：
    一、材料规格要逐渐统一。各地方管理机关应先召集所属的工厂开技术研究会，共同讨论解决。然后地方与地方间再交换意见，以求更广泛的统一。在讨论中，要吸收设计单位和用料单位的意见。
    二、生产部门应经常主动了解工程发展情况，向设计部门了解对材料质量的要求标准，向使用部门征询意见，以便不断改进质量，适应需要。绝不能以为销售合同已经订好，反正有主了，就不去注意改进质量。
    三、生产单位在制作过程中，要有严格的质量检查制度，够标准再出厂，千万不要不负责任地推出了事。产品的质量、规格和厂名，应附有说明，以便于收发保管和使用。
    四、要定量装箱，细心保管。现在有些铜活零件，只零散地用报纸缠裹起来，在运输和发领过程中，经压撞磨擦，至少要损失百分之二十，比箱皮的价值大得多。
