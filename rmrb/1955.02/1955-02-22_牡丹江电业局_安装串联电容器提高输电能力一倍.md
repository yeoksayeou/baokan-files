The Mudanjiang Electric Power Bureau's 22 kV transmission line could not meet the needs of local users due to the continuous development of power users in the supply area, even when the line was fully loaded. This caused a serious shortage of power, resulting in extremely poor power supply quality and restricting the future development of the area.

The line is more than 100 kilometers long. If a new line of the same type were built, the investment would be over 10 billion yuan. In order to save state funds and meet the needs of the area's future development, Zhao Hui, a technician in the Bureau's Production Technology Section, began to conduct research, adopting an overcompensation method (adding a set of series capacitors in the middle of the transmission line) to increase transmission capacity. This work received great attention and strong support from the Party and superiors from the beginning. With the enthusiastic assistance of the Institute of Electrical Engineering of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a relatively successful measure was finally proposed. Finally, it was reviewed and approved by the Northeast Electric Power Administration of the Ministry of Fuel Industry and implemented as an improvement project.

Currently, the series capacitors have been installed and completed. After various tests and trial operations, the results have been proven to be good, and the transmission capacity can be increased by 100 percent (i.e., doubled). According to preliminary estimates, it can increase the country's output value by more than 1.3 billion yuan annually.

It is the first time in China to use series capacitors in a power system. Now, the Northeast Electric Power Administration has begun to adopt this successful technological innovation experience to solve the problem of insufficient capacity of a 35 kV transmission line in a certain area of Northeast China, which will increase production and save a huge amount of wealth for the country.

    牡丹江电业局
    安装串联电容器提高输电能力一倍
    牡丹江电业局所属某二二千伏送电线路，由于供电地区动力用户不断的发展，以致线路虽在满负荷时也不能满足当地用户的需要，造成严重的负荷不足现象，使得供电质量异常低劣，限制了该地区今后的发展。
    该线路长达一百多公里，如果再新建一条同样的线路，其投资额将在一百亿元以上。为了节省国家资金，并适应该地区今后发展的需要，该局生产技术科技术员赵翯即开始进行研究，采用过补偿办法（在送电线路中间加装一组串联电容器）以提高输电能力。这项工作开始时就得到党和上级的重视和大力支持，并在中国科学院机电研究所的热诚援助下，终于提出一项较为成功的措施方案，最后经燃料工业部东北电业管理局审核批准，并作为一项改进工程进行施工。
    目前，串联电容器已安装竣工，经过各种试验及试运转，证实效果良好，可提高输电能力百分之一百（即提高一倍）。据初步核算，每年可给国家增产十三亿余元。
    把串联电容器利用到电力系统上在我国还是第一次。现在东北电业管理局已开始采用这项成功的技术革新经验，解决东北某地三五千伏输电线路容量不足的困难，将给国家增产节约巨量财富。
