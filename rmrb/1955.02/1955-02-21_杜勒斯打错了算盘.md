Dulles Miscalculated
Jiang Yuanchun

U.S. Secretary of State Dulles delivered a foreign policy speech in New York on the 16th. In this speech, Dulles used many peaceful words. However, what came through these words was that the United States not only wanted to seize China's territory of Taiwan, but also to seize China's coastal islands, preparing for a new war.

Dulles reiterated the U.S. determination to forcibly occupy China's territories of Taiwan and Penghu. He said that the "basic purpose" of the United States is to "ensure that Taiwan and Penghu are not taken by force by the Chinese Communists." When talking about China's coastal islands, Dulles said, "The United States has no obligation to defend these coastal positions for their own sake," but he believes that because the Chinese people are liberating the coastal islands to create favorable conditions for the liberation of Taiwan, this "forces" the United States to "take these closely related locations into consideration."

What Dulles said means that because the Chinese people want to liberate Taiwan and Penghu, the United States wants to interfere with the Chinese people's liberation of the coastal islands. In other words, because the United States wants to ensure its occupation of our territories of Taiwan and Penghu, it will further occupy China's territories of the coastal islands. What a rampant logic of an aggressor. What he said in so many twists and turns fully illustrates the U.S. plot to occupy the coastal islands and use them as stepping stones to attack mainland China.

The U.S. aggressive bloc's expansion of its aggression from Taiwan and Penghu to China's coastal islands is part of a long-planned scheme to invade China. Eisenhower had already indicated in his "special message" of January 24 that he would expand U.S. aggression "beyond the scope of Taiwan and Penghu." On February 4, "U.S. News & World Report" magazine, which often reflects the opinions of U.S. officials, included Kinmen Island and Matsu Island in the U.S. "defense line" in a map entitled "U.S. Defense Line Extends to the Chinese Coast."

But why must China's territories of Taiwan and Penghu be occupied by the United States? Dulles made no secret of their purpose: to expand aggression and prepare for a new war. Dulles admitted that the U.S. goal in the Far East is to establish a so-called "common security system" surrounding China through many bilateral or multilateral aggressive treaties with Asian countries. As Dulles said, "This system starts from the Aleutian Islands and forms a large arc to the South Pacific." In this so-called "Western Pacific defense system" of the United States, according to Dulles, Taiwan is "an important part," and therefore, Taiwan and Penghu are "naturally" a "matter of concern to the United States." In other words, Taiwan and Penghu "naturally" should become a U.S. military base for aggression against China.

When explaining why the United States turned Taiwan into its military base, Dulles also mentioned the "Treaty of Shimonoseki" of 1895. Dulles said that the "Treaty of Shimonoseki" made Taiwan part of Japan until Japan's defeat in World War II, which it then abandoned. Dulles completely ignored the two main factors that led to Japan's defeat: the Chinese people's eight-year War of Resistance and the Soviet Union's declaration of war against Japan, and attributed Japan's defeat to "mainly the efforts and sacrifices of the United States." The implication is that the United States therefore has the right to inherit the "Treaty of Shimonoseki" and make Taiwan part of the United States, just as Japan made Taiwan part of Japan. The "Treaty of Shimonoseki" was a treaty by 19th-century Japanese imperialism to invade China, and the U.S. aggressive bloc is now assuming the role of successor to the "Treaty of Shimonoseki," occupying Taiwan like Japanese imperialism did in the past. This proves what we have always said: that the United States is attempting to follow the old path of Japanese aggression against China. The blatant aggressive means used by the United States to occupy Taiwan fully prove this point.

Since the U.S. aggressive bloc regards Taiwan as its military aggression base, then what is the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique entrenched in Taiwan? Dulles gave a very clear answer to this question. He stated that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique was "entrusted with the power to govern these islands" in 1945. Who "entrusted" them? The United States has long promoted that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique received Taiwan on the orders of General MacArthur, then commander-in-chief of the Allied Forces in the Pacific. It can be seen that in the eyes of the U.S. aggressive bloc, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is nothing more than a running dog guarding the Taiwan base for the United States. This is entirely consistent with the fact that the British "Daily Herald" has already stated: "Chiang Kai-shek is nothing more than a U.S. puppet."

Dulles's unsolicited revelation of the true identity of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique makes British Foreign Secretary Eden's argument that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has so-called "representation" a laughing stock around the world. It is very clear that the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is merely a puppet and tool of the United States; it cannot represent anything. Eden once fabricated the so-called Taiwan status issue, attempting to use it to find a basis for creating "two Chinas" or a so-called "independent Taiwan," in order to serve the U.S. aggressive policy. But this argument has been refuted thoroughly even in Britain itself, so he created the issue of the so-called "representation" of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, attempting to manufacture "two Chinas" through another route. However, Eden's path is, of course, impassable.

After occupying Taiwan and Penghu, the United States, under the pretext of "protecting" Taiwan and Penghu, is attempting to further occupy other coastal islands of China. This proves that the logic of the U.S. aggressors is: in order to "ensure" the so-called "security" of the United States, the United States must occupy China's territory of Taiwan; in order to "ensure" the so-called "security" of Taiwan, the United States must occupy China's coastal islands; and the next step is: in order to "ensure" the so-called "security" of the coastal islands, the United States must occupy any place on the Chinese mainland. Henry Stimson, who once served as the U.S. Secretary of War, admitted in his book "Do We Want Another War?" that the U.S.'s so-called "security" "refers to the kind of security that allows this country (the United States of America) to dictate to the people of all countries in the world." Obviously, the purpose of the United States in gradually expanding its aggression against China is to attempt to restore the days when it dictated and ran rampant in China. Of course, no matter how perfect the U.S.'s aggressive dreams are, the Chinese people who have stood up will never let it be realized.

This aggressive ambition of the United States poses a huge and real danger to the people of Asia as well. The United States is actively invading Indochina, attempting to turn South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia into U.S. military bases. In order to ensure the so-called "security" of these bases, the United States will inevitably attempt to expand its aggression to other countries neighboring Indochina. The purpose of the United States is to expand its aggression layer by layer, so as to eventually encompass Asia and establish a pan-Asian military aggression system. In his speech, Dulles stated that when discussing the issues to be addressed at the upcoming Bangkok Conference, the main topics of the Bangkok Conference are so-called "military security" and "security against subversion directed from the outside." In other words, he wants to use military pressure to deal with Asian countries and interfere in the internal affairs of these countries from within, infringing upon their sovereignty. Dulles seems to think that under the pretext of all-encompassing so-called "security," the United States can do whatever it wants in Asia.

Can it really do whatever it wants? Dulles is not so sure. In his speech, he admitted that the people of Asia still retain a "fear" of colonialists. This so-called "fear" is actually hatred of colonialists. Dulles believes that eliminating this psychology is "very necessary."

In order to eliminate the traditional hatred of colonialists among the people of Asia, Dulles advocated that it is necessary to flaunt the "strength" of the United States in front of the people of Asia, to make the people of Asia see the "strength" of the United States, and to make them see that the United States is willing to use this "strength." In other words, it is to make Asian countries afraid of the strength of the United States and obediently accept the "protection" of the United States, just like Taiwan is "protected" by the United States, becoming a U.S. base for aggression.

It can be seen from Dulles's speech that the U.S.'s war provocations in the Taiwan and coastal islands region, and the step-by-step aggression against Chinese territory, are also part of this strategy to show strength to the people of Asia. However, Dulles miscalculated. When he talked excitedly about the U.S. aggressive plans, he clearly underestimated the power of the great Chinese people to resist aggression, and he also clearly underestimated the power of the Asian people to resist U.S. aggressive policies and war policies. The Chinese people, who have stood up in the struggle against aggression, have never been intimidated by any so-called "strength," and the independent and autonomous people of vast areas of Asia cannot be intimidated by anyone. If the U.S. aggressive bloc does not recognize this point as soon as possible, it will definitely suffer greatly as a result.

    杜勒斯打错了算盘
    蒋元椿
    美国国务卿杜勒斯十六日在纽约发表了一篇外交政策演说。在这篇演说中，杜勒斯用了很多和平字眼。但是，透过这些字眼传出来的却是美国不但要侵占中国的领土台湾，而且要侵占中国沿海岛屿，准备新的战争。
    杜勒斯重申美国决心强占中国的领土台湾和澎湖。他说，美国的“基本目的是保证台湾和澎湖不被中国共产党用强拿下”。谈到中国沿海岛屿的时候，杜勒斯说，“美国没有义务为了这些沿海阵地本身而保卫这些沿海阵地”，但是他认为由于中国人民解放沿海岛屿是为了替解放台湾创造有利条件，这才“迫使”美国把这些“密切有关的地点考虑进去”。
    杜勒斯这些话的意思是：由于中国人民要解放台湾和澎湖，美国才要干涉中国人民解放沿海岛屿。换句话说，由于美国想确保侵占我国的领土台湾和澎湖，因此它就要进一步侵占中国的领土沿海岛屿。好一个侵略者的猖狂逻辑。他转了许多弯讲出来的东西，完全说明了美国侵占沿海岛屿、把它们作为进攻中国大陆的踏脚石的阴谋。
    美国侵略集团把它的侵略从台湾、澎湖扩大到中国沿海岛屿，是早已策划好了的侵略中国的计划的一部分。艾森豪威尔在他一月二十四日的“特别咨文”中就已经表示要把美国的侵略扩大到“台湾和澎湖的范围以外”。在二月四日，经常反映美国官方意见的“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志就在一幅题为“美国防线推向中国海岸”的地图中，把金门岛和马祖岛划入了美国的“防线”。
    但是，为什么中国的领土台湾和澎湖必须由美国来侵占呢？杜勒斯毫不掩饰他们的目的就是为了扩大侵略，准备新战争。杜勒斯承认，美国在远东的目的是通过和亚洲国家的许多双边或多边的侵略条约，来建立一个包围中国的所谓“共同安全体系”。如杜勒斯所说，“这个体系北起阿留申群岛，形成一个大弧形到南太平洋”。在这个美国的所谓
  “西太平洋防御体系”里面，据杜勒斯说，台湾是
  “一个重要部分”，因此，台湾和澎湖就“当然”成了“美国所关心的问题”。换句话说，台湾和澎湖
  “当然”应该成为美国侵略中国的一个军事基地。
    杜勒斯在说明美国凭什么把台湾变成它的军事基地的时候，又提到一八九五年的“马关条约”。杜勒斯说，“马关条约”使台湾成了日本的一部分，一直到日本在第二次大战中失败而予以放弃为止。杜勒斯完全不谈促使日本失败的两个主要因素：中国人民的八年抗战和苏联的对日宣战，而把日本的失败说成“主要是由于美国的努力和牺牲促成的”。言下之意就是：因此美国就有权继承“马关条约”，像日本使台湾成为日本的一部分一样，使台湾成为美国的一部分。“马关条约”是十九世纪的日本帝国主义侵略中国的条约，美国侵略集团俨然以“马关条约”的继承人自居，像当年日本帝国主义一样侵占台湾，这就证明我们一向所说的，美国企图把日本侵略中国的老路一直走下去。美国侵占台湾所用的露骨侵略手段，也完全证明了这一点。
    美国侵略集团既然把台湾看作是它的军事侵略基地，那末盘踞在台湾的蒋介石卖国集团又算是什么东西呢？杜勒斯对这个问题作了极明确的解答。他表明，蒋介石卖国集团是在一九四五年“被委任以治理这些岛屿的权力”的。由谁“委任”的呢？美国早已宣传过，蒋介石卖国集团是奉当时太平洋盟军总司令、美国将军麦克阿瑟的命令接收台湾的。由此可见，在美国侵略集团眼里，蒋介石卖国集团不过是替美国看守台湾基地的一只走狗。这完全符合英国“每日先驱报”已经道出的事实：“蒋介石不过是美国的傀儡。”
    杜勒斯这样不打自招地表明了蒋介石卖国集团的真正身份，就使英国外交大臣艾登认为蒋介石卖国集团是有所谓“代表性”的论调成了全世界的大笑话。事情很清楚，蒋介石卖国集团只不过是美国的傀儡和工具，它什么也不能代表。艾登曾经制造所谓台湾地位问题，想用它来替制造“两个中国”或所谓“台湾独立国”找寻根据，以便为美国侵略政策服务。但这种论调甚至在英国国内也被驳斥得体无完肤，他于是又造出蒋介石卖国集团的所谓“代表性”的问题，企图从另一条途径来加工制造“两个中国”。但是，艾登的这条路当然是走不通的。
    美国在侵占台湾和澎湖以后，又以“保护”台湾、澎湖为借口，企图进一步侵占中国的其他沿海岛屿。这证明美国侵略者的逻辑就是：为了“保障”美国的所谓“安全”，美国就必须侵占中国的领土台湾；为了“保障”台湾的所谓“安全”，美国就必须侵占中国的沿海岛屿；紧跟着的下一步就是：为了“保障”沿海岛屿的所谓“安全”，美国就必须侵占中国大陆上的任何地方。曾经担任美国陆军部长的史汀生在他所著的“我们要有另一次战争吗？”一书中承认，美国的所谓“安全”就是
  “指那种使这个国家（美利坚合众国）可以对世界各国人民发号施令的安全”。很明显，美国这种逐步扩大侵略中国的目的，就是企图恢复它在中国发号施令、横行霸道的日子。当然，无论美国的侵略迷梦做得多么美满，站起来了的中国人民是决不会让它实现的。
    美国这种侵略野心对于亚洲人民同样存在巨大的现实的危险。美国正在积极侵略印度支那，企图把南越、老挝、柬埔寨变成美国的军事基地。为了保证这些基地的所谓“安全”，美国必然企图把它的侵略扩大到邻近印度支那的其他国家。美国的目的是要把它的侵略层层展开，层层扩大，以便最后囊括亚洲，建立一个全亚洲的军事侵略体系。杜勒斯在他的演说中谈到即将召开的曼谷会议所要处理的问题的时候，就表明曼谷会议的主要议题是所谓“军事安全”和“防止外界指挥的颠覆活动的安全”。换句话说，他既要用军事压力来对付亚洲国家，又要从内部去干涉这些国家的内政，侵犯它们的主权。杜勒斯好像认为，在无所不包的所谓“安全”的借口下，美国可以在亚洲为所欲为。
    究竟能不能为所欲为呢？杜勒斯又没有什么把握。他在演说中承认亚洲人民还保持着对于殖民主义者的“恐惧心理”。按这种所谓“恐惧心理”实际上是对于殖民主义者的憎恨。杜勒斯认为消除这种心理是“非常必要的”。
    为了消除亚洲人民对于殖民主义者的传统的憎恨，于是杜勒斯主张必须在亚洲人民面前炫耀美国的“实力”，使亚洲人民看到美国的“实力”，并且要他们看到美国愿意使用这种“实力”。换句话说，就是要使亚洲国家慑于美国的实力，俯首贴耳地接受美国的“保护”，就像台湾受到美国的“保护”一样，成为美国的侵略基地。
    从杜勒斯的演说中可以看出，美国在中国台湾和沿海岛屿地区剑拔弩张的战争挑衅，和对中国领土的步步侵略，也就是这种对亚洲人民显示实力的策略的一部分。但是，杜勒斯打错了算盘，他在兴高采烈地谈论美国的侵略计划的时候，显然低估了伟大的中国人民反抗侵略的力量，也显然低估了亚洲人民反抗美国侵略政策和战争政策的力量。从反抗侵略的斗争中站起来了的中国人民从来没有被任何所谓“实力”吓倒过，亚洲广大地区独立自主的人民，也不是谁吓得倒的。如果美国侵略集团不及早认识这一点，它一定要因此而大吃苦头。
