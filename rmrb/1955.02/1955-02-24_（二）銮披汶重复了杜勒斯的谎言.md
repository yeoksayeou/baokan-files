    (II) Phibun Repeated Dulles' Lies
    Thai Prime Minister Phibun, in a statement on February 21, twisted the establishment of the Dai Autonomous Region within China's Yunnan Province, based on the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, into a "springboard" and "base" threatening Thailand. He falsely claimed that the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Yunnan Province was there to "carry out aggression" against Thailand, and fabricated the story that Thai public leader Pridi Banomyong, residing in China due to political persecution, was engaged in some kind of "autonomous Thai movement." On the eve of the meeting in Bangkok of the eight participating countries of the Manila Pact, Phibun's open provocative slanders against the People's Republic of China cannot but arouse the attention of the Chinese people and all peace-loving Asian people.
    Phibun's absurd remarks are not worth refuting, and are completely copied from official American documents. As everyone knows, on November 11, 1954, when U.S. Secretary of State Dulles testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the Manila Pact, he cited the existence of so-called "aggressive intentions" on the part of China as a reason for the Manila Pact participating countries to hold a meeting quickly. What was the "evidence" of China's "aggressive intentions"? According to Dulles, it was the so-called "Free Thai Movement" within China and "a large Communist Chinese army" within China. This proves that Phibun was merely repeating the lies fabricated by Dulles.
    Phibun's slander exposes the major conspiracy of the Bangkok meeting against the People's Republic of China. The American aggressive bloc attempts to coerce its followers into drafting a military plan at this meeting to suppress the Asian national liberation movement, interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries, and antagonize the People's Republic of China. The American aggressive bloc also attempts to use Thailand as a headquarters and main base for planning and directing military adventures, in order to carry out war threats and war provocations against the People's Republic of China at any time. This American conspiracy is clearly not based on Thailand's interests, but on the interests of American aggressors. Phibun's actions only benefit the American aggressors and harm Thailand's national interests.
    The Chinese people have always been willing to maintain peaceful coexistence with Southeast Asian countries and other neighboring countries. However, the American aggressive bloc is doing its best to spread all kinds of doubts and fears to hinder the development of such relations. Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out in his government work report at the First Session of the First National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China on September 23, 1954: "In fact, not only is the so-called 'aggression threat' of our country to Thailand, the Philippines, and other Southeast Asian countries completely fictitious, but it is also groundless to believe that our country cannot establish normal diplomatic relations with Thailand and the Philippines. This is just an excuse used by the governments of these countries to justify their service to American aggressive forces." Today, Phibun is taking exactly this attitude. This attitude is completely contrary to the wishes and interests of the Thai people, and therefore completely contrary to the wishes and interests of peace-loving Asian people. It should be pointed out that this attitude will not yield any good results.

    （二）銮披汶重复了杜勒斯的谎言
    泰国总理銮披汶二月二十一日发表谈话，把我国云南省内傣族人民根据中华人民共和国宪法建立起来的傣族自治区，硬说成是威胁泰国的“跳板”和“根据地”，诬称驻扎在云南省内的中国人民解放军是为了对泰国“进行侵略”，并捏造因受政治迫害而在中国居留的泰国公众领袖拍侬荣搞什么“自治的泰族运动”。在马尼拉条约八个参加国在曼谷举行会议的前夕，銮披汶公开对中华人民共和国进行挑拨性的诬蔑，不能不引起中国人民和所有爱好和平的亚洲人民的注意。
    銮披汶的这些谰言是不值一驳的，而且完全是从美国官方的文件中抄袭来的。大家知道，一九五
  四年十一月十一日，美国国务卿杜勒斯在美国参议院外交委员会就马尼拉条约问题作证时，即以中国存在所谓“侵略意图”为理由，要求马尼拉条约参加国迅速举行会议。中国的“侵略意图”的“证据”是什么呢？据杜勒斯说，那就是：在中国境内的所谓“自由泰国运动”和中国境内的“一支庞大的共产党中国军队”。这就可以证明，銮披汶不过是重复了杜勒斯所捏造出来的谎言。
    銮披汶的诬蔑暴露了曼谷会议对中华人民共和国的重大阴谋。美国侵略集团企图胁迫它的追随者，在这次会议中拟订一个镇压亚洲民族解放运动、干涉亚洲各国内政、敌视中华人民共和国的军事计划。美国侵略集团并企图把泰国作为策划和指挥军事冒险的总部和主要基地，以便随时向中华人民共和国进行战争威胁和战争挑衅。美国这个阴谋显然不是从泰国的利益出发的，而是从美国侵略者的利益出发的。銮披汶这样做只能有利于美国侵略者，而给泰国的民族利益带来了损害。
    中国人民一向愿意同东南亚国家和其他邻国保持和平相处的关系。但是美国侵略集团却极力散播各种疑虑和恐惧来阻挠这种关系的发展。周恩来总理一九五四年九月二十三日在中华人民共和国第一届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的政府工作报告中指出：“事实上，不但所谓我国对于泰国、菲律宾和其他东南亚国家的‘侵略危险’完全是虚构，而且认为我国同泰国和菲律宾不能建立正常的外交关系也是毫无根据的。这只是这些国家的政府用来辩护自己为美国侵略势力服务的借口。”今天銮披汶所采取的，正是这样的态度。这种态度是完全违背泰国人民的愿望和利益的，因而也是完全违背爱好和平的亚洲人民的愿望和利益的。应该指出，这种态度决不会获得什么好的结果。
