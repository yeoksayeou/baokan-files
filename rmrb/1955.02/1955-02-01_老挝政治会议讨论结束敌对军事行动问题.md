Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 30th - According to Vietnam News Agency: The political conference held between the political delegation of the Royal Laotian Government and the political delegation of the Lao Fighting Forces has been discussing the issue of ending military actions between the two sides since January 20th.

During the five months since the signing of the armistice agreement, the French and Royal Laotian government forces have attacked the temporary garrison areas of the Lao Fighting Forces in Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces about 30 times, and have committed more than 60 instances of robbery and massacre, killing and wounding hundreds of Laotian civilians. These are serious violations of the armistice agreement.

In the statements issued by the Lao Fighting Forces delegation at the Laotian political conference on January 18th and January 20th, it was suggested that the Royal Laotian Government must guarantee that no military provocative actions would be taken against the Lao Fighting Forces, and it was stated that the Lao Fighting Forces would do its best to avoid any possible conflicts. This suggestion is in line with the spirit of the Geneva Armistice Agreement and is necessary to stop the current tense situation and create an atmosphere conducive to the current political negotiations.

It is reported that the Lao Fighting Forces delegation and the Royal Laotian Government delegation have agreed that all hostile military actions must be stopped. However, when it comes to specific issues, the opinions of the two delegations are not very consistent. The Lao Fighting Forces delegation demonstrated a sincere desire for negotiation and a conciliatory attitude, and modified some points in its suggestions to bring the opinions of both sides closer. However, so far, a complete agreement has not yet been reached.

The draft agreement under discussion mentions that, in order to implement the provisions of the Geneva Armistice Agreement, both parties guarantee to cease all hostile military actions. The Royal Laotian Government delegation suggested adding the following sentence: "In order to fulfill the declaration made by the Royal Laotian Government at the Geneva Conference on July 20, 1954." In fact, this declaration was made before the conclusion of the Laotian Armistice Agreement (July 21st) and does not fully comply with the Geneva Accords. Therefore, the Lao Fighting Forces delegation suggested adding the following sentence to the agreement: "In order to fulfill the provisions of the Geneva Armistice Agreement and the final declaration of the Geneva Conference attended by nine countries," without mentioning the declaration of the Kingdom of Laos. However, the Royal Laotian Government delegation still insisted on its previous opinion. Therefore, the agreement on stopping all hostile military actions in Laos has not yet been concluded, and the Royal Laotian Government delegation has returned to Vientiane to consult the Royal Laotian Government.

    老挝政治会议讨论结束敌对军事行动问题
    【新华社三十一日讯】据越南通讯社河内三十日讯：老挝王国政府政治代表团和寮国战斗部队政治代表团之间举行的政治会议，从一月二十日以来，一直在讨论结束双方之间的军事行动的问题。
    从停战协定签订以来的五个月中，法国和老挝王国政府方面曾进攻寮国战斗部队临时驻扎地段桑怒省和丰沙里省约有三十次之多，并且制造了六十多次抢劫和屠杀的事件，打死打伤成百的老挝平民。这是严重违反停战协定的行为。
    寮国战斗部队代表团一月十八日和一月二十日在老挝政治会议上发表的声明中，建议老挝王国政府必须保证不对寮国战斗部队采取军事挑衅行动，并且声明，寮国战斗部队方面将尽力避免一切可能发生的冲突。这个建议是符合日内瓦停战协定的精神的，并且是必要的，以便制止目前的紧张局势和创造一种对当前的政治谈判有利的气氛。
    据悉，寮国战斗部队代表团和老挝王国政府代表团已经同意必须停止一切敌对军事行动。但是，当谈到具体问题时，两国代表团的意见还不是很一致的。寮国战斗部队代表团表现了进行谈判的真诚愿望和和解的态度，对它建议中的若干点加以修改，使双方意见可以接近一些。但是，直到目前为止，意见还没有完全取得一致。
    在讨论中的协议草案提到，为了实施日内瓦停战协定的规定，双方保证停止一切敌对军事行动。老挝王国政府代表团建议加上下面这句话：“为了履行老挝王国政府一九五四年七月二十日在日内瓦会议上发表的声明”。事实上，这个声明是在缔结老挝停战协定（七月二十一日）那一天以前发表的，它并不完全符合于日内瓦协议。因此寮国战斗部队代表团建议在协议中加上下面这句话：“为了履行日内瓦停战协定的规定和九个国家所参加的日内瓦会议的最后宣言”，而不提老挝王国的声明。但是，老挝王国政府代表团仍然坚持它以前的意见，因此，关于停止在老挝的一切敌对军事行动的协议还没有缔结，老挝王国政府代表团已经回万象去请示老挝王国政府。
