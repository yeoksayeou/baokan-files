    Why the Oil and Fat Company Can't Sell Its Oil, Yet Consumers Can't Buy It
    Zhang Bingqian
    Since Hebei Province implemented the planned supply of edible oil, the state-owned Oil and Fat Company has frequently failed to complete its supply plans. In the second and third quarters of last year, it only completed 62.45 percent of the two-quarter plan, and it also failed to complete the sales task according to the rural supply indicators in the fourth quarter. The oil that should have been sold wasn't sold, and the people who needed oil didn't get their share. What is the reason?
      I. Failure to Supply According to Supply Indicators
    Hebei Province stipulates that farmers in plain areas should be supplied with four ounces of oil per person per month. This supply indicator is determined based on production and the needs of local people in general situations. If the supply is strictly in accordance with this indicator, it can basically meet the needs. However, many places have not supplied according to this indicator. The Wanzhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Anci County did not supply edible oil at all from July to September last year. The Jiuzhou Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Anci County supplied 517 households in Nanhai Village with one ounce of edible oil per household in July last year. Some districts in Huanghua County supplied only two ounces per person. These are not enough, even falling far short of the prescribed amount.
    For the oil used by industries such as pastries, pasta, and restaurants, the supply standards in many cities and towns are either too high or too low, resulting in waste or insufficient supply. For example, in Wen'an County, 4,845 jin of oil were sold in October last year, of which 1,946 jin were purchased by cooperative canteens, food departments, and private pasta businesses (excluding six private pasta businesses), accounting for more than 40 percent of the total oil sales in the city. Due to the excessive supply, each household used oil to fry oil cakes and fried dough sticks. Restaurants fried a large number of small fish for sale, and the small fish fried by the cooperative canteen couldn't meet the demand, so they also fried a large number of potatoes to replace the small fish. There was a lot of waste. Conversely, the supply in the fourth and fifth districts of Anci County was too low. It was stipulated that restaurants using 800 jin of flour per month should be supplied with 10 jin of oil; those using 400-500 jin should be supplied with 4-5 jin of oil. Not a drop more was supplied. The oil was not enough for each household, so they went everywhere to buy lard and fatty pork as substitutes.
    Retaining "standby" oil at each level also seriously affected the supply quantity. The so-called retaining "standby" oil at each level means discounting the supply at each level, resulting in a smaller and smaller amount of oil that should be supplied, so that the masses cannot eat the prescribed amount of oil. As a result, commodities are stockpiled.
    II. Few Supply Points, Chaotic Supply Methods
    Due to the small number of supply points or the inappropriate setting of points, it often causes many difficulties for the masses to buy oil. For example, Renqiu County has to supply more than 6,000 households with edible oil every month, but there is only one store selling oil, and the masses have to queue up to buy oil every day, wasting a lot of manpower and time. The first district of Wen'an County governs dozens of villages, but there are only two stores selling oil. Some counties have vast areas and sparse villages, with villages generally 30-40 li apart. Many villages do not have supply points, and the masses have to travel dozens of li to buy oil, which is very inconvenient.
    To solve this difficulty, the number of supply points should be appropriately increased, or "door-to-door delivery" should be implemented. There are two ways of "door-to-door delivery": one is for the supply and marketing cooperative to send people to form mobile sales teams to directly deliver goods, and the other is to use private merchants and peddlers (i.e., oil carriers, oil carts, etc.). Many areas in Hebei Province have done poorly in both of these methods. For example, the Shizhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Yuanshi County, Shijiazhuang Prefecture, should supply edible oil to five villages, but the oil that should have been supplied in November last year was not supplied to two villages until December 4 (and three households did not buy oil). The remaining three villages had not eaten the oil for November until December 7. In terms of organizing oil carriers and oil carts to go to the countryside, some counties have only organized three or two small oil vendors, and many counties have not even organized one.
    Chaotic oil purchase methods are also one of the main reasons for not doing a good job in supply work. In the past, the vast majority of areas did not issue oil purchase tickets or oil purchase certificates. When the masses bought oil, some relied on cooperative membership cards or grain purchase certificates; some relied on certificates from district or township governments; some did not need anything, only relying on word of mouth or standing in line. These methods have great shortcomings. If you rely on the cooperative membership card, you cannot eat oil if you have not joined the supply and marketing cooperative; if you rely on the grain purchase certificate, a large part of the surplus grain households and non-grain-deficient households in the countryside do not have grain purchase certificates; if you rely on a certificate, farmers have to travel a long way to get a certificate for buying a few ounces of oil, which not only delays production but also hinders the work of district and township governments; relying on word of mouth or standing in line has no basis. In Xingtang, Xinle, Wuji and other counties, many deviations have occurred in the past because no certificates were required. For example, a farmer in Baishu Village, Xingtang County, had only two people in his family, but he reported thirteen people, and he was sold oil accordingly. In Wuqiang and other counties in Cangxian Prefecture, many places relied on standing in line to buy oil, with limits on quantity but no limits on the number of times, regardless of the size of your family. Anyway, only those who stand in line are sold to. If you want to buy more oil, you only need to stand in line several times in a row or have more people stand in line. If you don't have time to stand in line, then don't think about eating oil. The method of the Shizhuang Village Cooperative in Yuanshi County, Shijiazhuang Prefecture, is even worse. They only supply each village once a month, and each time is limited to two days. Regardless of whether you buy it or not, it will not be sold after the expiration date. These methods have caused confusion in supply.
    III. Improper Adjustment, Untimely Transportation
    Improper adjustment of edible oil and oilseed between regions. Some areas are not oil-producing areas, or although they are producing areas, they have suffered natural disasters. Therefore, in these areas, part or a large part of the edible oil must be transferred from other areas. For example, Tianjin Prefecture suffered relatively heavy floods last year, and oil production decreased, and most of the edible oil had to be supplied from other areas. However, due to the lack of a comprehensive and thorough plan in advance, it was not until parts of Renqiu, Wuqing, and Qingxian counties in Tianjin Prefecture experienced stock-outs in November that 800 tons of edible oil were hastily transferred from Shijiazhuang and Cangxian prefectures. Not only did it affect the entire plan, but there were also problems with temporary requests for train allocations and train cars.
    Because the production, preferences, and habits of the masses in each region are different, it is necessary to pay attention to the appropriate adjustment of edible oil varieties in order to better meet the needs of the masses. For example, in Hejian, Xianxian and other places in Cangxian Prefecture, more than 100,000 jin of cottonseed oil were stockpiled for a long time in the fourth quarter of last year because the local people were not used to eating this kind of oil. However, the masses in many counties in Shijiazhuang Prefecture liked to eat cottonseed oil, but the supply was not available. This shows that the adjustment of varieties is very important, and there are also conditions to take care of the different needs of the masses.
    Doing a good job in transportation is an important part of doing a good job in supply. If transportation work is not done well, supply work cannot be done well. For example, the city of Yanshan County in Cangxian Prefecture was out of edible oil for nearly a week in October last year because transportation work was not done well. Gaocheng, Raoyang and other counties in Shijiazhuang Prefecture had not transferred the edible oil for this month to the grassroots supply units by the middle of December last year, so the supply for this month did not begin until the end of the month, which made the masses very dissatisfied. If the edible oil that should be supplied in the current month can be transferred to all grassroots supply units in advance in the previous month (at the latest in the late last month), completely (at least half), this kind of stock-out phenomenon will not occur.
    In addition, whether the inventory is real will directly affect the supply and source of goods; and whether the inventory figures are real depends on whether the accounting is timely. For example, the Liangzhao Grassroots Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Renqiu County still had 3,460.8 jin of oil on its books in late November last year, but it had actually been out of stock for ten days, and there was no oil in the warehouse. This kind of so-called "inventory" cannot play any practical role. If it is used as the basis for supply and organizing sources of goods, of course mistakes will occur! The only way to reverse it is: it is necessary to report the accounts to the higher-level supply and marketing cooperative and the oil and fat company in a timely manner, and to make the accounts and goods consistent as much as possible, and it is necessary to maintain a certain amount of "reasonable inventory".
    Due to the poor work of planned edible oil supply, not only is the edible oil supply plan unfulfilled, but also, in the rural areas of oil-producing areas, the masses are worried that they will not be able to eat oil, and there is a general reluctance to sell oilseeds. For example, in Hebei Province, only 42 percent of sesame seeds had been purchased by January 15 this year, which is a very obvious example. In addition, not doing a good job in the supply of edible oil leads to many farmers squeezing their own oil, which is a great waste. In Anggezhuang District, Luan County, Tangshan Prefecture, the masses spent as much as 1 million jin of peanuts between October and November last year because they squeezed their own oil for consumption. Among the 2,553 households in 11 villages including Zhaogezhuang in the fourth district of the county, about 90 percent squeezed their own oil. As of November 20, these 11 villages had consumed about 150,000 jin of peanuts, with each household consuming as little as a dozen jin and as much as 250 jin. Some farmers even have enough edible oil stored to meet the supply indicators for the whole family for seven years. The occurrence of this phenomenon not only wastes oilseeds but also seriously affects the production enthusiasm of farmers and the worker-peasant alliance.
    It can be seen that all these shortcomings and problems are by no means due to any shortcomings in the implementation of the planned edible oil supply policy itself, but mainly because our subjective efforts are not enough and there are serious shortcomings in the implementation of the policy. In the future, we must learn from the lessons, earnestly strengthen the study of policies and business, strengthen investigation and research and planning management, strengthen the combination between state-owned oil and fat companies and supply and marketing cooperatives, earnestly implement the principle of urban-rural division of labor, make full use of rural private merchants, and strive to do a good job in the supply of rural edible oil.

    为什么油脂公司的油卖不出，消费者又买不到油
    张秉谦
    河北省自从实行食油计划供应以来，国营油脂公司的供应计划经常不能完成。去年第二、三两季度只完成两季计划数的百分之六十二点四五，第四季度也没有按照农村供应指标完成销售任务。应该卖出的油没有卖出，要吃油的人没吃到自己应吃的一份油，原因在那里呢？
      一、没有按照供应指标供应
    河北省规定平原区农民每人每月供应四两油。这个供应指标是根据生产和当地一般人在一般情况下的需要确定的。如果严格按照这个指标供应，基本上能满足需要。但很多地方没有按照这个指标供应。安次县万庄供销合作社，去年七月至九月根本没有供应食油。安次县九洲供销合作社去年七月对南海村五百一十七户农民是按每户一两食油供应的。黄骅县有的区曾按每人二两供应。这都不够规定数量，甚至差得很远。
    对糕点、面食、饭馆等行业的用油，很多城、镇的供应标准过高过低，造成浪费或供应不足。例如文安县城里，去年十月销油四千八百四十五斤，合作食堂和食品部及私营面食业就购去一千九百四十六斤（还有六家私营面食业未计入），占全城销油总量的百分之四十多，由于供应数量过多，各户都用油炸油饼、油条，饭铺大量炸小鱼出售，合作食堂炸的小鱼供不应求，还大量炸土豆代替小鱼供应。浪费很大。相反的，安次县第四、五两区，供应的数量又显得过低。规定饭铺每月用面八百斤的，供油十斤；四、五百斤的，供油四、五斤。多一点也不供应。各户的油不够用，就到处去买猪油和肥猪肉来代用。
    层层留“机动”油，也严重地影响了供应数量。所谓层层留“机动”油，也就是层层打折扣，结果把应该供应的油量越变越小，使得群众吃不到规定数量的油。这样作的结果，就造成商品积压。
    二、供应点少、供应方法混乱
    由于供应点少或设置的点不适当，常常给群众买油造成很多困难。例如任邱县城每月要供应六千多户的食油，可是只有一个门市部卖油，群众每天不得不排队买油，浪费人力和时间很多。文安县第一区管辖几十个村庄，只有两个门市部卖油。有些县地区辽阔，村庄稀少，村与村间一般相距三、四十里，很多村庄没设供应点，群众买油，来回要跑几十里路，很不便利。
    解决这个困难，应该适当地增加供应点，或是“送货上门”。“送货上门”的办法有两种，一种是供销合作社自己派人成立流动推销组直接去送货，一种是利用私商、小贩（即油挑、油车等）。河北省很多地区对这两种办法都作得很差。例如石家庄专区元氏县史庄供销合作社应该供应五个村子的食油，可是去年十一月份应该供应的油，直到十二月四日才供应了两个村（其中还有三户没买到油），其余三个村直到十二月七日还没吃到十一月份的油。在组织油挑、油车下乡方面，有些县份仅仅组织过三、两个小油贩，很多县份甚至一个也没有。
    购油办法很混乱，也是作不好供应工作的主要原因之一。过去绝大多数地区都没发购油票或购油证，群众买油时，有的凭社员证、购粮证；有的凭区、乡政府证明；有的什么也不要，只凭口说或站队。这些办法都有很大缺点。如果凭社员证，没入供销合作社就吃不到油；如果凭购粮证，农村中很大一部分的余粮户和不缺粮的户就没有购粮证；如果凭证明信，农民为买几两油要跑很远的路去开证明信，既耽误生产，还妨碍区、乡政府工作；凭口说或站队，什么依据也没有。在行唐、新乐、无极等县，过去因不要凭证，曾发生过很多偏差。如行唐县柏树村有家农民只两口人，他报了十三口，也就照卖给他油了。沧县专区武强等县很多地方都凭站队买油，限量不限次，不管你家人口多少。反正只卖给站队的人，要想多买油，只要一连站上几次队或者多来几个人站队就行了。没有功夫站队那就别想吃油。石家庄专区元氏县史庄村社的办法更糟糕，他们每月对每村只去供应一次，一次又只限两天，不管你买到没有，过期不卖。这些办法都造成了供应上的混乱。
    三、调剂不当、运输不及时
    地区间食油、油种的调剂不当。有些地区不是油料产区，或者虽是产区而遭受了自然灾害，因此，在这些地区，一部分或者很大一部分的食油就须由其他地区调入。例如天津专区去年遭受水灾较重，油料生产减少，大部食油须由外区供给。但由于事前缺乏通盘周密的计划，直到天津专区任邱、武清、青县等县部分地区在十一月间发生脱销后，才仓促由石家庄，沧县两专区紧急调运了食油八百吨，不但牵动了整个计划，而且临时请拨火车，车皮也有问题。
    由于各地区的生产和群众的爱好与习惯都有所不同，所以必须注意食油品种的适当调剂，才能更好地供应群众的需要。例如沧县专区河间、献县等地，在去年第四季度曾长时期积压过十多万斤棉油，就是因为当地群众不习惯吃这种油。而石家庄专区许多县份的群众却又喜欢吃棉油，但供应不上。这说明品种的调剂是很重要的，而且也有条件照顾群众的不同需要。
    做好运输工作是做好供应工作的重要一环，不把运输工作做好，就不能做好供应工作。例如沧县专区盐山县城，去年十月食油脱销将近一星期，就是因为运输工作没有做好。石家庄专区藁城、饶阳等县，去年十二月到月中还没有把这一个月份的食油调运到各基层供应单位，所以快到月底才开始供应这个月的食油，群众很不满。如果把当月份应该供应的食油能提前在上一月份（至迟在上月下旬）全部（至少半数）调运到各基层供应单位，就不会发生这种脱销现象。
    此外，库存数是否真实，也会直接影响到供应和货源；而库存数字的真实与否，却要看报账的是否及时。如任邱县梁召基层供销合作社在去年十一月下旬，账面上还存有三千四百六十斤八两油，实际已经脱销了十天，库里并无存油。像这样的所谓“库存”，是起不了什么实际作用的，如要拿它来当作供应和组织货源的依据，当然要发生错误！扭转它的唯一办法是：必须及时向上级供销合作社和油脂公司报账，尽可能地作到账、货相符，而且必须保持一定数量的“合理库存”。
    由于食油计划供应工作做得不好，不但使食油供应计划完不成，并且，在产油区的农村，群众也担心自己吃不到油，普遍对油料产生惜售情绪，如河北省收购芝麻，直到今年一月十五日止只完成百分之四十二，就是一个很明显的例子。另外，不把食油供应工作做好，以致许多农民自己榨油，浪费很大。唐山专区滦县安各庄区群众在去年十月和十一月间由于自己榨油吃，竟耗费花生果一百万斤之多，该县第四区赵各庄等十一个村的两千五百五十三户农民中，约有百分之九十都自己榨过油，到十一月二十日止，这十一个村共耗费花生米约十五万斤，每户少者十多斤，多的到二百五十斤。甚至有些农户自存食油足够七年全家供应指标数。这种现象的发生，不仅浪费油料，还严重地影响到农民的生产积极性和工农联盟。
    可以看出，所有这些缺点和问题的发生决不是实行食油计划供应政策本身有什么缺点，而主要是由于我们的主观努力不够，执行政策上有严重缺点。今后必须接受教训，认真加强政策和业务的学习，加强调查研究和计划管理，加强国营油脂公司和供销合作社之间的结合，认真执行城乡分工原则，充分利用农村私商，为做好农村食油供应工作而努力。
