Response to Criticism and Suggestions

    Huaiyin Agricultural School Attaches Importance to Mulberry Garden Management
    A letter from Jiangsu Huaiyin Agricultural School: We sincerely accept the criticism of our school's farm made by Comrade Zhou Mi published in the "Reader's Letters" column on January 23rd. Because our school was founded not long ago and the foundation is weak, our leadership only paid attention to the cultivation of crops and neglected the management of mulberry gardens, resulting in reduced mulberry leaf production. In the future, our farm work will, under the principle of cooperating with educational practice, try our best to improve the existing mulberry gardens and seedling fields, and increase the production of mulberry leaves and mulberry seedlings to support the saplings and silkworm feed needed for the vigorous development of the silkworm industry.
    In addition, it is necessary to explain that the fresh cocoon yield of a sheet of silkworm eggs is generally 60 to 70 jin. The previous report of 12,000 jin was the silkworm production of 200 mu of mulberry gardens.

专栏：批评建议的反应

    淮阴农业学校已重视桑园的管理
    江苏淮阴农业学校来信：一月二十三日“读者来信专页”刊载周密同志对我校农场的批评，我们诚恳地接受。由于我校创办不久，基础较差，在我们领导思想上只重视农作物的栽培，忽视对桑园的管理，以致造成了桑叶减产，今后我们农场工作在配合教育实习的原则下，尽量来搞好现有桑园和苗田，增加桑叶和桑苗的产量，以支援大力发展蚕桑事业所需要的苗木和养蚕饲料。
    另外，需要顺便说明的，一张蚕种一般鲜茧量为六、七十斤，上次报上说一万二千斤，乃是二百亩桑园的养蚕产量。
