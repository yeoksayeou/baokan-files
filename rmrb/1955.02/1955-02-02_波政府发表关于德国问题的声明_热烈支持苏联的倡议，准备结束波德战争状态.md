    The Polish Government Issues a Statement on the German Question
    Warmly Supporting the Soviet Initiative and Preparing to End the State of War with Germany
    [Xinhua News Agency, 1st Dispatch] The Polish Press Agency published a statement from the Government of the People's Republic of Poland on January 31st regarding the peaceful resolution of the German question.
    The statement points out that the Soviet government's statement on the German question on January 15th and the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on January 25th regarding the end of the state of war between the Soviet Union and Germany have created new possibilities for reaching an understanding on the German question and on normalizing relations between European countries. The Polish government warmly supports the Soviet initiative.
    The statement says that Poland deeply hopes to eliminate the roots of aggressive wars incited and organized by German militarism and to establish friendly relations with neighboring Germany. The relations between our country and the German Democratic Republic, based on the existing and defined Oder-Neisse line, are a clear proof that friendly cooperation between Poland and Germany is in the interests of both countries.
    The statement says: The People's Republic of Poland hopes to contribute to the peaceful stability of relations among European countries and to the normalization of its relations with Germany. Based on this aspiration, the government of the People's Republic of Poland has suggested to the State Council of the People's Republic of Poland to make a decision to end the state of war between Poland and Germany. This will further strengthen the friendly ties between Poland and the German Democratic Republic. It is also believed that the normalization of relations between Poland and the Federal Republic of Germany is possible.
    The statement points out that the Polish government's efforts have always been to support the resolution of the German question through peaceful reunification of Germany on democratic principles and the conclusion of a just peace treaty. The Polish government firmly opposes the revival of German militarism in any form. If the Western governments and the government of the Federal Republic of Germany were to force the ratification of the Paris Agreements and the remilitarization of West Germany, the People's Republic of Poland, together with other peace-loving countries, will take all necessary measures to ensure the safety of Poland and other countries.

    波政府发表关于德国问题的声明
    热烈支持苏联的倡议，准备结束波德战争状态
    【新华社一日讯】波兰通讯社在一月三十一日发表了波兰人民共和国政府关于和平解决德国问题的声明。
    声明指出，苏联政府一月十五日关于德国问题的声明和苏联最高苏维埃主席团一月二十五日关于结束苏联同德国间的战争状态的命令创造了使德国问题和就欧洲各国关系正常化问题达成谅解的新的可能性，波兰政府热烈支持苏联的倡议。
    声明说，波兰深切希望消除德国军国主义所煽动的和组织的侵略战争的根源和同相邻的德国建立友好关系。我国同德意志民主共和国之间以现有的和确定的奥德—尼斯分界线为基础的关系，是波兰和德国之间的友好合作符合于两国利益的一个清楚的证明。
    声明说：波兰人民共和国希望对欧洲各国间关系的和平稳定和对它同德国间关系的正常化作出贡献。波兰人民共和国政府根据这种愿望出发，已经向波兰人民共和国国务委员会建议作出结束波兰同德国间的战争状态的决定。这样就将进一步加强波兰和德意志民主共和国的友谊联系。并且认为，波兰和德意志联邦共和国之间的关系正常化也是可能的。
    声明指出，波兰政府的努力始终是为了支持用在民主原则的基础上和平统一德国和缔结一个公正的和约的办法来解决德国问题。波兰政府坚决反对以任何形式复活德国军国主义。要是西方各国政府和德意志联邦共和国政府竟强使巴黎协定得到批准和使西德重新军国主义化，波兰人民共和国同其他爱好和平国家一道，将要采取一切必要的措施来保证波兰和其他国家的安全。
