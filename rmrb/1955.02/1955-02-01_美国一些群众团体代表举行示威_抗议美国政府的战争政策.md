    Xinhua News Agency, Washington, January 30th: Approximately sixty representatives from several mass organizations in New York and Philadelphia came to Washington on the 29th and demonstrated outside the White House, protesting the Eisenhower administration's policy of using American armed forces against the People's Republic of China under the pretext of "defending" Taiwan.
    The groups represented by the demonstrators were the Catholic Worker Union of New York City, Peace Advocates, the War Resisters League, and the Fellowship of Reconciliation of Philadelphia. They held up signs with slogans such as "Don't risk World War III," "Preventive war is collective suicide," and "Stop the drift towards war." The demonstrators also distributed leaflets pointing out that the U.S. government's policy risked causing a war.
    Xinhua News Agency, January 31st: TASS, New York, January 30th: Some American newspapers have published many letters to the editor criticizing America's aggressive actions in the Far East.
    The "New York Herald Tribune" published a letter from Moses on January 29th. The letter stated, on what grounds can the United States tell China that a hostile nation will continue to control a large island one hundred miles off the Chinese coast. Moses wrote, "I don't think that the form of the Chinese polity is our business. If the Chinese Communists occupied any islands or territories a hundred miles off our coast, we would be justified in not tolerating such a situation."
    A letter from Becker published in the "Washington Post" on January 29th read, "What would we say if Cuba and some islands off the coast of Florida were under the rule of Confederate holdouts (who masquerade as the American government, constantly hoping to return to the mainland), and if Russian cruisers in the Caribbean and Russian air forces based in the Bargom Islands, Bermuda, and southern Nova Scotia supported these holdouts?" Becker called on the government to abandon
  “reckless and revanchist actions.”
    Independent Senator Morse (Oregon) said that he continued to receive many letters, "In every hundred letters, only one supports the President's proposal, while the rest condemn it."

    美国一些群众团体代表举行示威
    抗议美国政府的战争政策
    【新华社三十日讯】华盛顿消息：纽约和费城的几个群众团体的代表约六十人二十九日到华盛顿来在白宫外面举行示威，抗议艾森豪威尔借口“保卫”台湾要用美国武装部队反对中华人民共和国的政策。
    示威者所代表的团体是纽约市的天主教工人工会、和平拥护者、反战同盟以及费城的修好团契。他们举着标语牌，上面写着：“不要冒第三次世界大战的危险”、“预防性战争就是集体自杀”、“制止奔向战争的倾向”。示威者还散发了传单，指出美国政府的这种政策有引起战争的危险。
    【新华社三十一日讯】塔斯社纽约三十日讯：美国某些报纸刊载了许多抨击美国对远东的侵略行为的读者来信。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”一月二十九日刊载了莫塞斯的一封信。信中说，美国根据什么理由能对中国说：怀着敌意的国家今后仍将继续控制离中国海岸一百英里的大岛。莫塞斯写道：“我认为，中国政体是什么形式，不关我们的事。如果中国共产党占据了离我们海岸一百英里的任何岛屿或是领土，我们是有理由不容忍这种情况的。”
    “华盛顿邮报”一月二十九日刊载的贝克尔的一封信写道：“如果古巴和佛罗里达海岸的某些岛屿处在南部联邦残余分子的统治下（这些残余分子冒充是美国政府，经常希望返回大陆），如果俄国在加勒比海的巡洋舰和以巴尔戈姆岛屿、百慕大以及新苏格兰南部为基地的俄国空军支持这些残余分子，我们将会说些什么呢？”贝克尔要求政府放弃
  “冒失的和复仇主义的行动”。
    无党无派参议员莫尔斯（俄勒冈州）说：他像过去一样不断收到许多来信，“在每一百封信中，只有一封信支持总统的建议，其他都是谴责总统的建议的。”
