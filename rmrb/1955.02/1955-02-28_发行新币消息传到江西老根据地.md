News of the issuance of the new Renminbi quickly spread throughout the old revolutionary base area of Jiangxi. The people of the old revolutionary base area particularly expressed their support for this important economic measure of the state.

When they saw the sample of the new Renminbi on the newspaper, especially the picture of Jinggang Mountain, the cradle of the revolution, many people fondly recalled the currency issued by the former Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government. During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the currency issued by the Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government was divided into denominations of one yuan, five jiao, three jiao, two jiao, one jiao, and five fen. This currency had a stable value, was widely circulated, and was warmly supported by the masses. After the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army went north to resist Japan, the Kuomintang reactionaries threatened the local people, forbidding them from keeping this currency, and conducted strict inspections. However, the people of the old base area firmly believed that the people's army would return victoriously, and they risked their lives to preserve the currency issued by the Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government using various methods.

After the liberation of Jiangxi Province, the People's Government actively redeemed the currency issued by the former Workers' and Peasants' Democratic Government. From 1950 to the end of 1954, a total of 771,516.55 yuan of this currency was recovered, and 1,157,274,825 yuan of Renminbi was exchanged at an exchange rate of 1 yuan to 1,500 yuan. The people of the old base area were very moved during the exchange. Gong Qizhong, a farmer in Butou Village, Xingguo County, happily said: "The Communist Party and Chairman Mao really care for the people. In the past, the bills issued by the Kuomintang reactionaries depreciated every day, and I don't know how much money they cheated from the common people. The people's government can still exchange the banknotes issued more than ten years ago, which is really trustworthy."

While recalling and discussing these facts, the people of the old base area are even more convinced that the state's issuance of new currency this time will definitely bring greater benefits to the people. In the past few days, people have been vying to spread this good news. Everyone is looking forward to the day when the new currency is issued.

    发行新币消息传到江西老根据地
    本报记者　孙祖年
    发行新的人民币的消息很快传遍了江西老革命根据地。老革命根据地的人民对国家这项重要的经济措施特别表示拥护。
    当他们从报纸上看到新人民币的票样，特别是革命摇篮井冈山的图景的时候，许多人亲切地回想起前工农民主政府发行的货币。在第二次国内革命战争时期，工农民主政府发行的货币，票面分为一元、五角、三角、二角、一角、五分等几种。这种货币，币值稳定，流通很广，受到人民群众的热烈拥护。中国工农红军北上抗日以后，国民党反动派威胁当地人民，不准保存这种货币，并且进行了严格的检查。但是老根据地人民深信人民的军队一定会胜利归来，他们冒着生命危险用各种办法把工农民主政府发行的货币保存下来。
    江西省解放以后，人民政府积极收兑了前工农民主政府发行的货币。从一九五零年到一九五四年底，共收回这种货币七十七万一千五百一十六元五角五分，按照一元兑换一千五百元的折合比率，兑出人民币十一亿五千七百二十七万四千八百二十五元。在兑换时，老根据地人民非常感动。兴国县埠头村农民龚其中高兴地说：“共产党、毛主席真体贴人民。过去国民党反动派发的票子天天跌价，不知骗了老百姓多少钱。人民的政府在十几年以前出的钞票到现在还能兑换，真有信用。”
    老根据地人民在回想着和谈论着这些事实的时候，更加深信国家这次发行新币，一定会给人民带来更大的好处。几天来，人们都竞相传告着这个好消息。大家都盼望着发行新币的日子到来。
