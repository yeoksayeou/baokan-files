In a Courtyard
-- Remembering Housewife Li Shuzhen Reporting a Thief
　　Gu Ye
　　Song Chen opened a shop in Nanlishi Road, a suburb west of Beijing, to buy scrap paper. However, this shop resembled a hotel, with people often staying there. Those who stayed were mostly children. They would leave in the morning with empty baskets and return in the evening with baskets full of goods, selling everything to Song Chen. Before long, these young travelers were becoming well-off. Zhang Xueqin, nicknamed “Little Fatty,” arrived with only the clothes on his back. Within just a few dozen days, he had acquired many items, including a brand-new set of bedding and clothes.

　　Those who didn't know the details assumed it was from labor and didn't think much of it. However, Li Shuzhen, a housewife living in the same courtyard as Song Chen, suspected something was wrong. Especially recently, Song Chen had burned electric wires several times, making her even more suspicious.

　　One day, Song Chen and his accomplice, Jia Changhai, were fiddling with a pile of firewood in front of the gate, the smoke bothering everyone in the courtyard. Li Shuzhen couldn't stand staying inside, so she went out and saw that they were burning a pile of electric wires, and asked:
　　"Song Chen, why are you burning that?"
　　"Burning off the rubber to sell the copper; it's hard to sell with the skin on."
　　"Are you burning broken wires or good wires?"
　　"Hehe! Who would throw away good wires? The kids picked them up, of course they're old and broken."

　　Li Shuzhen thought that what Song Chen said made some sense: who would throw away good wires? Besides, would he dare to burn good wires in front of the gate? But she also considered: where would the children pick up so many broken wires? When she looked more closely, trying to distinguish between good and bad wires, the pile of firewood was almost burned out.

　　For several days, Li Shuzhen was constantly thinking about this. She connected it to Song Chen's many suspicious behaviors recently. When Song Chen first started this business, only two or three children came to sell scrap items each day. Later, Song Chen partnered with Jia Changhai, luring a group of children, giving them food and lodging, and buying things they picked up. Every morning, Song Chen would wake up and shout for the children to go to construction sites such as New Beijing. Li Shuzhen saw that the children were being incited to bad behavior. At first, they carried back basket after basket, and then they used pedicabs to haul them back, cart after cart. But she only saw t-shirts, iron pots, and high-top leather shoes mixed in with the waste paper. Actually, at this time, the children were picking up brand-new steel bars, hemp ropes, and thin iron wires and selling them to Song Chen as scrap. However, Song Chen would absolutely not buy this kind of "scrap" in front of outsiders. One night, someone brought a spool of silk rope and some construction equipment. Li Shuzhen unintentionally stepped into Song Chen's house and encountered them discussing this transaction. But when Song Chen noticed someone was there, he changed his tone and said, "This is usable material, I won't buy it." When that person left, Song Chen gave him a sum of money. Another time, Li Shuzhen saw the children bring back two large handfuls of goggles, and Song Chen also said these were usable materials and he wouldn't take them. Li Shuzhen thought about this, and said to herself: "Song Chen doesn't take usable materials. I didn't see it, but he bought so many electric wires; when I did see it, he said they were broken. ..." While she was wondering about this, she encountered Song Chen burning electric wires by the wall again that night. She realized that she hadn't guessed wrong: the children couldn't possibly pick up so many broken electric wires. She resolved to find out what was really going on.

　　In the past, the things the children picked up were dumped in the courtyard. Now, Song Chen realized that someone was paying attention to him, so he changed his ways and had them dumped inside the house. To discover anything, she would have to disregard their relationship and go to Song Chen's house. This stumped Li Shuzhen. She thought: "We live in the same courtyard, and we used to be very harmonious; if we fall out, what will we say when we meet every day? What if he tries to fight me?..." A series of questions and concerns were swirling in Li Shuzhen's mind. It wasn't until she recalled many things that moved her greatly that she felt these concerns were unwarranted. She thought of her tragic life under the oppression of the landlord class before liberation, and how she had become a master of the country from an ordinary housewife after liberation, and her happy life after marrying a worker in 1953; she thought of the rapidly developing construction of the great motherland. Especially after she got married, she deeply realized how valuable every bit of effort workers contributed to the motherland's construction was. She remembered that when her husband was busy at work, he often worked day and night, and always happily. This made her feel that everyone was making useful things for the construction of the motherland, and had put in their own hard work. So she felt that Song Chen was not burning electric wires, but burning the flesh on her own body. She said to herself: "Everyone is building every day, making an electric wire, and setting it up. How much sweat does a worker shed? But Song Chen only needs a few minutes to chop it a few times, and it's all ruined. He's destroying so many things, and the country doesn't even know it. So be it if we fight, if I don't report you, you'll just keep stealing!"

　　One day, she waited for the children to carry their things into the house, and then mustered up the courage to follow them in. She saw a basin and two bundles of good electric wires. She thought: "You're hiding everything from me, saying it's all broken, what about this?" When Song Chen saw her, his eyes turned red, and he put his hands on his hips, saying aggressively, "Weigh it! As long as I don't buy big guns or bombs, I, Song Chen, dare to take anything. My business is approved by the government, who can stop me!?" Song Chen thought that buying these things wouldn't be a big deal anyway, so he made a big scene, thinking that this would scare away this housewife. But Li Shuzhen felt that things were clearer and even more angry. She thought: "Oh, you dare to take anything! You little brat, how much of the workers' blood and sweat have you wasted! How many children have you corrupted!"

　　Song Chen saw Li Shuzhen leave and didn't pay attention to her at all. In order to get more money, he not only taught the children many methods of stealing, but also began to set some conditions with Jia Changhai to restrain the children. For example, when they discovered that Zhang Xueqin had taken things to sell to others, they not only beat him severely, but also threatened to send him to the police station, until he begged for mercy, and then they set three conditions for him: first, the stolen things could only be sold to them; second, he had to listen to their orders; third, he had to eat the food cooked here, whether it was good or bad, at a cost of 2,500 yuan per meal.

　　One night, Li Shuzhen heard Song Chen say to the children in the toilet: "The things you get tomorrow should be a little over a foot long, no more than two feet, that's all I want." Jia Changhai continued, "I'll go tomorrow too." She thought this must be stealing electric wires again, and she had to find a way to get evidence no matter what.

　　The next day, Jia Changhai followed the children to the roadside to look at a section of electric wire. The children asked him "Is it okay?" He said, it has to be in sections. Zhang Xueqin, Xiao Wozi, and Jia Changhai's younger brother Jia Changjiang went to break the electric wire, and then cut this section of thick electric wire worth four million yuan into many short sections. In the afternoon, Li Shuzhen saw Jia Changhai and Jia Changjiang return first, and not long after, Zhang Xueqin returned on a pedicab. Several children carried a basket that looked very heavy, and put it down as soon as they reached the gate. They all ran to call Song Chen. Li Shuzhen took two steps forward, pushed the waste paper aside, and saw that it was full of large tree roots. She was very surprised: why isn't it electric wires? But if it was tree roots, why would they cover it with paper? She casually took one. Song Chen and the others had already walked over. She ran home quickly and threw the thing in her hand on the ground. Song Chen realized that things were going wrong, and immediately told everyone to go back. Only the child Xiao Linzi was there next to the basket. Li Shuzhen ran over and asked him:
　　"Xiao Linzi, what is this?"
　　"Electric wire."
　　"How can electric wire be so thick, I think it looks like a tree root."
　　Xiao Linzi took one and held it up for her to see, and said, "Take a look." She saw that inside the rubber that had been dirtied with soil, there were a dozen copper strands as thick as bean sprouts. Li Shuzhen realized that electric wire could be this thick. She thought, "Let's see what you, Song Chen, have to say today?"

　　A group of people walked over. When Jia Changhai and Zhang Xueqin were carrying the basket to be weighed, they pretended to say, "What is this thing so heavy?" After weighing, Song Chen unusually told them to dump it in the courtyard. When he saw it was electric wire, Song Chen deliberately put on a stern face and said, "Who told you to get this? Ten or eight strands is okay, where did you get so much? I don't want it!" Li Shuzhen remembered Song Chen not taking usable materials, and said, "You want it, what are you afraid of? These are all sections, all 'unusable' things." Song Chen glared at her angrily, and after a long while, he said to the children, "Whoever you sold it to before, take it and sell it to them." Li Shuzhen thought, "You're trying another trick! If I don't keep an eye on you, you'll burn the 'broken wires' again. Today, wherever you go, I'll follow you!" She saw Zhang Xueqin putting the electric wire into the basket and carrying it out. Song Chen felt that something was wrong, and hurriedly said, "Jia Changhai, you follow him, see where he sells it, and send him to the police station!" But then he whispered in Jia Changhai's ear to hurry up and bury the electric wire first. Li Shuzhen knew that it wouldn't work to chase after them like this, so she hurried to find the comrades from the Public Security Bureau.

　　The police station was in the west, but Jia Changhai and Zhang Xueqin were walking towards the east. But just as they entered Fuchengmen, they were arrested by two comrades from the Public Security Bureau. Immediately afterwards, the thief Song Chen, who used various despicable means to instigate children to steal thousands of pounds of steel bars, hemp ropes, and electric wires belonging to the state, also fell into the people's net along with the habitual thief Jia Changhai.

    在一个院落里
    ——记家庭妇女李淑贞检举盗窃犯
　　顾页
    宋臣在北京西郊南礼士路开了一个收买烂纸的小铺，可是这个小铺却很像一个旅馆，经常有人来住宿。来这里住宿的都是些孩子。他们早上背着空筐子离开这里，晚上背着满筐货物归来，把全部货物卖给宋臣。不久，这些小旅客们一个个都阔气起来了。那个绰号叫“小胖子”的张学勤，刚来时就是一个人和他穿的一身破旧衣服，来后仅几十天，他便添置了许多东西，制了一套全新的被子、褥子、衣裤。
    不了解底细的人，以为这是劳动所得，都没拿它当回事。和宋臣同院居住的家庭妇女李淑贞却认为这里面有问题。特别是近日来宋臣几次烧电线，使她更加疑心了。
    一天，宋臣和他的同伙贾长海在街门前拨弄着一堆柴火，烟薰得满院的人不舒服。李淑贞在家里别不住，出门来，看见他们烧的是一堆电线，便问：
      “宋臣，你干吗烧它呀？”
    “把胶皮烧掉，好卖铜；这东西带皮不好卖。”
      “你烧的是破电线还是好电线？”
    “嘿嘿！好电线谁肯扔了？孩子们拾回来的，当然都是破旧的了。”
    李淑贞觉得，宋臣说的也有点道理：谁肯把好电线扔了呢？再说，好电线他敢在街门前烧？但她又考虑：孩子们从哪里能够拾得这许多破电线？等她再认真看，想辨别一下究竟是好线坏线时，那堆柴火呼呼呼地都快烧尽了。
    一连几天，李淑贞都在翻来覆去地考虑这件事，她联想到宋臣近来的许多可疑的行为。宋臣刚做这个生意时，每天只不过两三个孩子来卖点破烂什物。此后，宋臣和贾长海合伙做这个买卖，便勾引来一群孩子，给他们吃喝住宿，收买他们拾回来的东西。每天清晨，宋臣便起来吆喝孩子们到新北京等建筑工地去。李淑贞看见孩子们全被怂恿坏了，先是一筐一筐地背回来，继后就叫三轮车一车一车地拉回来。但她只发现烂纸里夹杂着汗衫、铁壶、高腰皮鞋。其实这时孩子们把崭新的钢筋、麻绳、细铁丝都当破烂拾回来卖给宋臣了。只是宋臣当着外人绝对不买这类“破烂”。有一天深夜里，一个人送来一盘丝绳子和一些建筑器材，李淑贞无意间跨进宋臣家的门，正遇着他们在谈这笔生意。可是宋臣发现有人，就改变了口气说：“这是成材的东西，我不买。”那人离开时，宋臣却给了他一笔钱。又一次，李淑贞遇见孩子们提回来两大撮风镜，宋臣也说这是成材的东西，他不收。李淑贞想到这里，自言自语地说：“宋臣不收成材的东西。我没看见，他倒买了这许多电线；看见了，他又说是破了的。……”心中正在纳闷，这天夜里又遇见宋臣在墙边烧电线，她才觉得自己没猜错：孩子们是不可能拾到这许多破电线的。她下决心要弄清究竟是什么事。
    从前孩子们拾回来的东西都倒在院里，现在宋臣觉察到有人在注意他，就改变了方式，叫倒到屋里。想发现什么，除非不顾情面，到宋臣家里去。这可把李淑贞难住了。她想：“我们同院住着，过去都很和气；现在要翻了脸，以后天天见面说什么？他要和我拚命，怎么办？……”一连串的问题，各种各样的顾虑，这时在李淑贞的脑子里纠缠不清。一直到她想起许多使她非常激动的往事时，她才觉得这些顾虑是不应该有的。她想到解放以前她在地主阶级压迫下的悲惨生活，想到解放以后她从一个普通家庭妇女变成了国家的主人，想到一九五三年她和一个工人结了婚以后的幸福生活；想到伟大祖国飞速发展着的建设事业。特别是在她结婚以后，更深切地了解到工人们在祖国建设事业中贡献的每一分力量都是多么可贵。她想起自己的丈夫在工作紧张时，往往不分昼夜地干活，还总是愉快的。这使她觉得每个人都在为祖国建设事业制造着有用的东西，都曾经付出了自己的辛勤劳动。所以她觉得宋臣不是在烧电线，而是在烧她自己身上的肉，她对自己说：“大伙儿天天建设，造一根电线，再把它架好，工人要流多少汗，可是宋臣只需要几分钟，剁几下，就全坏啦。他破坏了好多东西，国家还不知道哩。拚命就拚命吧，我不检举你，还能让你老偷下去！”
    一天，她等孩子们刚把东西背进屋，就鼓足勇气跟进去，瞅见一个盆和两捆好电线。她想：“你尽瞒着我，都是破的，这呢？”宋臣见了她就红眼啦，两手叉着腰，气势汹汹地说：“称吧！只要不买大枪，不买炸弹，我宋臣什么也敢要。我这买卖是政府批准了的，谁还阻拦得了我！？”宋臣想着买这点东西反正不会出什么大事，所以大吵大闹，以为这样就可以把这个家庭妇女吓退。李淑贞却觉得事情更明白了，也更加气愤了。她想：“哦，你敢要！你这小子，糟踏了多少工人的血汗！支使坏了多少孩子！”
    宋臣看见李淑贞离开了，根本不把她放在眼里。他为了弄到更多的钱，不仅教给孩子们许多偷窃的方法，并且开始和贾长海规定了一些条件来约束孩子们。比如他们发现张学勤把东西拿去卖给别人，不仅狠狠地揍了他一顿，还威胁着要把他送派出所，直到他求饶，才给他订了三个条件：一是偷的东西只准卖给他们；二是听他们指挥；三是这里煮的饭，好坏都得吃，每餐二千五百元。
    一天夜里，李淑贞在厕所里听到宋臣对孩子们说：“你们明天弄的东西，最长一尺多，别超过二尺，我就要。”贾长海接着说：“赶明儿我也去。”她想这一定又是偷电线了，这一下无论如何要设法拿到证据。
    次日，贾长海跟着孩子们去马路边看了一段电线。孩子们问他“可以吗？”他说，要一节一节的。张学勤、小卧子和贾长海的弟弟贾长江三个人便去把电线砸断，然后把这段价值四百万元的粗电线砍成许多短节。午后，李淑贞看见贾长海和贾长江先回来，不大一会儿，张学勤乘一辆三轮也回来了。几个孩子抬着一个看来很重的筐，刚搬到门边，就放下了。他们都跑去叫宋臣。李淑贞两步跨过去，把烂纸拨开，瞅见里面尽是些大树根，心里很诧异：怎么不是电线？可是要是树根，他们还拿纸遮盖着干吗？她随手拿了一根，宋臣他们已经走过来了，她快步跑回家，把手里的东西扔到地上。宋臣发现坏事了，立即叫大家回去。筐子旁边，只有小林子一个孩子在那里。李淑贞就又跑过去问他：
    “小林子，你说这是什么？”
      “电线。”
    “电线哪有这么粗的，我看像大树根。”
    小林子拿出一根来竖着给她看，说：“你瞅瞅。”她一看，原来那用泥土弄旧了的胶皮里，包着十几股像豆芽那般粗细的铜丝，李淑贞才知道电线也有这样粗的，她心想：“今天看你宋臣又说什么？”
    一群人都走过来了。贾长海在和张学勤抬着筐子去过秤时，假意说：“什么东西这样重？”称毕，宋臣破例叫倒在院里。一看是电线，宋臣便故意板起面孔说：“谁让你们弄这个？十根八根还可以，弄这么多哪来的？我不要！”李淑贞想起宋臣不收成材的东西这件事来，就说：“你要了，怕什么？这一节一节的，都是不‘成材’的东西。”宋臣气鼓鼓地瞪了她一眼，过了半晌才对孩子们说：“你们原来卖给谁，就拿去卖给谁。”李淑贞心想：“你又另来一套！我不瞅见，你又要烧‘破电线’啦。今天你到哪儿，我跟到哪儿！”她看见张学勤把电线装到筐里，背着往外走，就追出院去。宋臣感到不对劲，急忙说：“贾长海，你跟着去，看他卖到哪里，把他送到派出所！”但又低声在贾长海耳边催他快走，先把电线埋起来。李淑贞知道这样追去不行，她赶快去找公安局的同志。
    派出所在西头，贾长海和张学勤却往东头走。但是刚入阜成门，就被两个公安局的同志逮捕了。紧接着，这个用各种卑鄙手段教唆儿童偷窃了国家数千斤钢筋、麻绳、电线的盗窃犯宋臣，也同惯窃贾长海一起落入了人民法网。
