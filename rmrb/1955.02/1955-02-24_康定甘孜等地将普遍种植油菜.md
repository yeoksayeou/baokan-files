After the successful trial planting of rapeseed in the high and cold areas of the Kangzang Plateau, the People's Government of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province has decided to promote it widely throughout the region this year to meet the needs of people of all ethnic groups for edible oil. The promotion area will cover more than ten counties including Kangding and Ganzi, many of which are more than 3,000 meters above sea level and have never grown rapeseed before. The total planting area in the region will reach approximately 20,000 mu. (Report from our Xikang Correspondent Station)
