Short commentary:

    The United States, disregarding the Geneva Conference agreements, is wantonly interfering in the situation in Indochina, seriously threatening the peace of Indochina. This is a grave fact that everyone knows. General Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army Vo Nguyen Giap in his memorandum to the Chairman of the International Supervisory and Monitoring Commission in Vietnam on December 5th of last year, and Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam Pham Van Dong in his statement to the Chairman of the Geneva Conference on December 5th of last year regarding the mission of U.S. General Collins, have both successively enumerated irrefutable facts, denouncing the United States' crimes of violating the Geneva Accords. However, the United States has not repented, and has instead intensified its conspiratorial activities to undermine the Geneva Accords. After the Manila Treaty forcibly included Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam into the "protected" area of the signatory countries, the United States is now attempting to further formally pull Cambodia, Laos, and South Vietnam into the military alliance of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, in order to ultimately rekindle the flames of war in Indochina.

    One of the main objectives of the U.S.-convened Bangkok conference is to realize this conspiracy. According to a United Press dispatch from Bangkok, Dulles expressed at the Bangkok conference that he wanted South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia to "formally participate" in the Southeast Asia Treaty. At the same time, Dulles carried out rampant war threats and exerted pressure on its allies, attempting to coerce them to betray their international obligations under the Geneva Accords together with the United States. Another United Press dispatch from Bangkok, based on the remarks of an "extremely reliable American source," pointed out that the United States, in addition to "threatening China by releasing Chiang Kai-shek from Taiwan and Syngman Rhee from Korea, will also rely on the joint action of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries to prevent the Communists from taking action before they start." In other words, the United States wants to use the Southeast Asia Treaty area, Taiwan, and South Korea as bases for a three-pronged encirclement to launch a preemptive war against China. These reports fully prove that the United States' activities to undermine the Geneva Accords are aimed primarily at the People's Republic of China as its main target. These activities seriously threaten the peace of Indochina and should arouse the serious attention of peace-loving people of all countries.

    It should be particularly pointed out that, according to Reuters, the United States is now "very concerned about the situation in Laos." The Bangkok conference also specifically "discussed the situation in northern Laos."

    As everyone knows, the so-called situation in northern Laos was created by the United States. At the end of last year, Laotian armed bandits invaded Muong Bun in Sam Neua province. The Lao fighting forces seized a letter from the bandits, which proved that the invasion of Sam Neua province by Laotian armed bandits was directly instigated by the United States and received the active support of the United States. The author of the letter wrote: "This is a secret and must not be told to anyone: I have contacted the United States, and the United States will help us easily eliminate the Communists." However, now at the Bangkok conference, the United States and some of its followers are shamelessly clamoring to take swift action to "save Laos." They also fabricated claims such as "the Communists are using Phong Saly City in Laos as a foothold for subversive attacks," and "the Communist threat of subversion against Laos is indeed real." It is obvious that this open fabrication is purposeful. It is to create a basis for the United States' attempt to undermine the Geneva Accords and control Phong Saly and Sam Neua.

    At the same time, a Reuters report inadvertently revealed that according to the provisions of the Geneva Accords, elections in Laos will be held in August this year. Therefore, the United States also wants to use these cries to create tension in order to undermine this election, deprive the Laotian people of their democratic freedoms, and pave the way for the United States to turn Laos into a U.S. colony and military base. For this purpose, Dulles is also preparing to go to Laos personally after the Bangkok conference to make arrangements.

    The United States' conspiracy to further undermine the Geneva Accords by using the Bangkok conference is very brazen and blatant.

    It should be pointed out that British Foreign Secretary Eden, as one of the chairmen of the Geneva Conference, undertook the international obligation to ensure the implementation of the Geneva Accords. However, he not only fails to stop these obvious activities of the United States to undermine the Geneva Accords, but also indulges in these activities at the Bangkok Conference, which is strongly opposed by all people who care about peace in Asia and respect international obligations.

    The Chinese people resolutely abide by the agreements of the Geneva Conference and are closely concerned about peace in Indochina and the Far East. We firmly oppose the criminal acts of the United States and its followers in undermining the Geneva Accords. All peace-loving Asian people will not allow the American conspiracy to succeed.

### 决不容许美国的阴谋得逞

    决不容许美国的阴谋得逞
    美国不顾日内瓦会议的协议，肆行干涉印度支那局势，严重威胁着印度支那的和平。这是大家都知道的严重事实。越南人民军总司令武元甲在去年十二月五日向越南国际监督和监察委员会主席提出的备忘录，越南民主共和国外交部长范文同在去年十二月五日向日内瓦会议主席提出的关于美国柯林斯将军的使命的声明，都曾先后列举无可辩驳的事实，指责了美国违反日内瓦协议的罪行。但是，美国毫不悔改，并且变本加厉地进行破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋活动。马尼拉条约硬把柬埔寨、老挝和南越划入签字国的“保护”地区后，美国又力图进一步把柬埔寨、老挝和南越正式拉进东南亚条约的军事同盟，以便最后在印度支那重新燃起战火。
    美国召开曼谷会议的主要目的之一，就是为了实现这个阴谋计划。据合众社发自曼谷的电讯，杜勒斯在曼谷会议上表示想使南越、老挝和柬埔寨都能“转为正式地参加”东南亚条约。同时，杜勒斯大肆进行战争威胁，对它的盟国横施压力，企图胁迫它们和美国一起背弃日内瓦协议的国际义务。合众社从曼谷发出的另一条消息，根据一个“极其可靠的美国人士”的谈话，指出美国对中国“除了以从台湾放出蒋介石和从朝鲜放出李承晚相威胁以外，还要依靠东南亚条约组织国家的联合行动，以便在共产党还没有开始行动以前就加以阻止”。换句话说，美国要把东南亚条约地区、台湾和南朝鲜作为对中国发动先发制人的战争的三面包围的基地。这些消息完全证明，美国破坏日内瓦协议的活动是以中华人民共和国作为其主要的敌对目标的。这些活动严重地威胁着印度支那和平，应该引起各国爱好和平人民的严重注意。
    特别应该指出的是，据路透社消息，美国现在“很关心老挝的局势”。曼谷会议还特别“讨论了老挝北部的局势”。
    大家知道，所谓老挝北部的局势是美国制造的。在去年年底，老挝武装匪徒曾进犯桑怒省的芒奔，寮国战斗部队从匪徒身上缴获了一封信，这封信证明，原来老挝武装匪徒向桑怒省的进犯是由美国直接指使，并得到美国的积极支持的。这封信的作者写道：“这是秘密，不能向任何人讲：我已跟美国联系过，美国会帮助我们轻易地消灭共产党”。但是，现在在曼谷会议上，美国和它的一些追随者却无耻地叫嚷要迅速采取行动来“拯救老挝”。他们还捏造什么“共产党正在利用寮国的丰沙里城作为颠覆进攻的踏脚石”，
  “共产党对老挝的颠覆威胁是的确存在的”。一望而知，这种公开的造谣活动是有目的的。它就是为美国企图破坏日内瓦协议，控制丰沙里和桑怒制造根据。
    同时据路透社的消息无意中透露，根据日内瓦协议的规定，老挝选举将在今年八月举行。因此，美国还要利用这些叫嚷来制造紧张局势，以便破坏这个选举，剥夺老挝人民的民主自由权利，为美国把老挝变成美国的殖民地和军事基地开辟道路。为了这个目的，杜勒斯还准备在曼谷会议后亲自到老挝去进行布置。
    美国利用曼谷会议进一步破坏日内瓦协议的阴谋活动，是十分放肆和露骨的。
    应该指出，英国的外长艾登是日内瓦会议的主席之一，承当了保证实施日内瓦协议的国际义务。但是，他对美国这些彰明昭著的破坏日内瓦协议的活动却不但不去制止，反而在曼谷会议中纵容这些活动，这是一切关心亚洲和平、尊重国际义务的人们所强烈反对的。
    中国人民坚决遵守日内瓦会议的协议，密切关心印度支那和远东的和平。我们坚决反对美国和它的追随者破坏日内瓦协议的罪恶行为。一切爱好和平的亚洲人民将不能容许美国的阴谋得逞。
