The National Higher Medical College Teaching Syllabus Review Conference, jointly convened by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Higher Education in Beijing, concluded on February 10th after eleven consecutive days. The conference was attended by representatives from twenty-nine higher medical colleges across the country, totaling over two hundred medical experts, professors, and others, as well as eighteen Soviet experts from the Ministry of Health, Beijing Medical College, and other units.

The main purpose of the conference was to finalize the teaching syllabus for national higher medical colleges. This teaching syllabus was drafted in accordance with the spirit of the First National Higher Medical Education Conference held last August, with the aim of carrying out teaching reforms, learning from advanced Soviet experiences, and promoting traditional Chinese medicine. Six months prior to the conference, the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Higher Education tasked relevant teaching and research sections of three schools to draft preliminary outlines for each subject, based on the Soviet medical teaching syllabus, taking into account the equipment of Chinese higher medical colleges, the level of teachers and students, the prevalence of diseases in China, and China's medical achievements, and adapting them to the needs of national economic construction. These drafts were then distributed to higher medical colleges across the country to solicit opinions. Based on the more than eleven thousand eight hundred suggestions received from various locations, Beijing Medical College was responsible for compiling the initial drafts for hygiene and pediatrics, China Medical University for medical treatment, Shanghai First Medical College for radiology, and Shanghai Second Medical College for Latin. At this conference, the initial drafts were discussed in detail in the spirit of unity and full democracy, and with the personal assistance of eighteen Soviet experts throughout the process, the final draft was approved as the national higher medical college teaching syllabus.

At the conference, Soviet experts Polderev and Dushkevich from the Ministry of Health, as well as pathology expert Fedorov and others, gave reports. Professor Li Tao of Beijing Medical College and President Lu Zhijun of the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine gave reports on "The History of the Development of Traditional Chinese Medicine" and "How to Study and Research Traditional Chinese Medicine," respectively. The medical department of China Medical University and the hygiene department of Beijing Medical College gave reports on their experiences in studying the Soviet medical teaching syllabus. During the conference, an exhibition of traditional Chinese medicine heritage and medical teaching materials was also held.

Vice Minister of Health He Cheng gave a concluding report at the end of the conference. The report pointed out the main features of the teaching syllabus finalized at the conference: First, it is guided by dialectical materialism and applies Pavlov's theory, demonstrating a break from bourgeois idealism. Second, it serves the country's socialist construction, embodies all of the country's new systems, and is permeated with the principle of putting prevention first. Third, it has distinct national characteristics, which facilitates the cultivation of students' patriotic ideology. This highly ideological and scientific teaching syllabus includes fifty-four subjects and will be jointly promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Higher Education.

    高等医学教学大纲已定稿

    会议主要目的是对全国高等医学院校的教学大纲作最后定稿。此项教学大纲是根据去年八月召开的第一届全国高等医学教育会议精神，为了进行教学改革，学习苏联先进经验和发扬祖国医学而拟定的。大纲的每一学科，半年以前即由卫生部和高等教育部责成三个学校的有关教研室，以苏联医学教学大纲为蓝本，结合中国高等医学院校设备情况、教师和学生的水平，结合中国多发病情况和中国的医学成就等，并适应国家经济建设的需要拟定草稿，分送全国各高等医学院校广泛征求意见。然后根据各地所提出的一万一千八百多条意见，由北京医学院负责对卫生专业和小儿科专业、中国医科大学对医疗专业、上海第一医学院对放射学、上海第二医学院对拉丁文分别整理成初稿。此次会议本着团结和充分发扬民主精神的原则对初稿作了详细讨论，在十八位苏联专家自始至终的亲自帮助下最后定稿为全国高等医学院校教学大纲。
    会议上由卫生部苏联专家波尔德烈夫和杜施凯维奇以及病理学专家菲德洛夫等作了报告。北京医学院李涛教授和中医研究院鲁之俊院长在会议上分别作了“祖国医学发展史”与“关于如何学习研究祖国医学”的报告。中国医科大学医疗系和北京医学院卫生系在会议上分别作了关于学习苏联医学教学大纲的体会报告。会议期间还举办了祖国医学遗产及医学教学资料展览会。
    会议最后由卫生部贺诚副部长作总结报告。报告指出，会议定稿的教学大纲的主要特点：第一，它是以辩证唯物主义为指导思想而且运用了巴夫洛夫学说的，它显示摆脱了资产阶级的唯心思想；第二，它是为着国家社会主义建设服务的，它体现了国家的一切新制度，也贯穿了预防为主的卫生原则；第三，它具有鲜明的民族色彩，便于培养学生的爱国主义思想。这一具有高度思想性和科学性的教学大纲包括五十四种学科，将由卫生部和高等教育部联合公布施行。
