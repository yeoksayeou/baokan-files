    China Food Company System Makes Some Improvements in Livestock Management
    Letter from China Food Company: The "Reader's Letters" page of the People's Daily published on January 2nd, "Food Companies Should Immediately Improve Livestock Breeding Work," made criticisms of the serious shortcomings in the live animal breeding work of food companies in various regions. This was very timely and correct, and we sincerely accept it.
    At present, the live animal breeding management work in our company system is still unsatisfactory. The improvement and enhancement of our work lags far behind the development of our business, especially in relation to the rapid expansion of commodity reserves. Before August of last year, there were only pig pens nationwide capable of holding about 448,000 pigs, and no cattle or sheep pens. In the fourth quarter, some pig pens were added, capable of holding a total of more than 770,000 pigs, and very few cattle pens were built. However, the storage volume of live pigs last year reached more than 880,000, reaching more than 1.1 million at its peak. Due to our lack of foresight, we did not make adequate preparations before purchasing large quantities of livestock, and some storage and transportation departments were irresponsible, leading to the chaotic phenomenon in livestock breeding management work. This is a lesson we should remember.
    In order to improve livestock breeding management work, we have issued instructions twice, requiring food companies in various regions to organize capable cadres to conduct thorough inspections, do a good job in live animal reserve work, and learn and promote advanced experiences in breeding management work. Recently, according to our understanding, the leadership of food companies in most regions has paid attention to livestock breeding management work. For example, the Beijing Food Company and the Tianjin Supply Station have made significant improvements in breeding management work. Other places such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Henan, Shandong, and Hunan are also actively trying to improve.

### 中国食品公司系统对牲畜的管理有些改进

    中国食品公司系统对牲畜的管理有些改进
    中国食品公司来信：一月二日，人民日报“读者来信专页”上发表了“食品公司应立即改进牲畜饲养工作”，对各地食品公司活畜饲养工作中的严重缺点提出批评，这是十分及时和正确的，我们诚恳接受。
    目前，我公司系统中的活畜饲养管理工作仍然是不能令人满意的。我们工作的改进和提高，远远落后于业务的发展，尤其是同商品储备量的迅速扩大不相适应。在去年八月份以前，全国仅有约可容猪四十四万八千多头的猪仓，没有牛仓和羊仓，到了第四季度增建了一些猪仓共可容猪七十七万多头，修建的养牛仓很少。然而去年毛猪的储存量竟达到八十八万多头，最高的时候达到一百一十多万头。由于我们缺乏预见性，在大量收购牲畜以前没有做好准备工作，再加上有些储运部门不负责任，以致形成牲畜饲养管理工作的混乱现象，这是值得我们记取的教训。
    为了改进牲畜的饲养管理工作，我们曾两次发出指示，要求各地食品公司组织得力干部进行深入的检查，做好活畜的储备工作，学习和推广饲养管理工作中的先进经验。最近，根据我们了解，大部分地区的食品公司领导方面对牲畜的饲养管理工作已经引起重视。如北京市食品公司、天津供应站在饲养管理工作上有了显著的改进。其他如江苏、浙江、河南、山东、湖南等地也都在积极设法改进中。
