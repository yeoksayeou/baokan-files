Xinhua News Agency, February 5th: According to TASS Ulan Bator: The Mongolian Peace Preservation Committee held a meeting in Ulan Bator on the 4th.

The Chairman of the Committee, Sirindib, analyzed the international situation in his speech at the meeting. He described the struggle of peace-loving people from various countries against the new conspiracies of war-mongers. He said that the Mongolian people resolutely condemn the London and Paris agreements, because the conclusion of such agreements is an act of undermining peace and security. The Mongolian people advocate that the United States armed forces must not obstruct the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, an inseparable part of Chinese territory.

The meeting passed a resolution: to launch a signature campaign on the World Peace Council Standing Committee's "Appeal to the People of the World on the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons." After the resolution was passed, the members of the Mongolian Peace Preservation Committee were the first to sign the "Appeal to the People of the World."

Xinhua News Agency, February 5th: According to TASS Jakarta, February 4th: Indonesian newspapers demand an immediate ban on nuclear weapons.

The Indonesian "People's Daily" said in an editorial: "The issue of using atomic energy for peaceful purposes is more urgent than ever before. The Soviet Union's proposal to provide its experience in the peaceful use of atomic energy has opened up a good prospect for the solution of this problem." The "People's Daily" continued, but "the imperialists are continuing to manufacture atomic weapons and have already transported atomic cannons to West Germany..."

The "People's Daily" emphasized that the Indonesian government and people have clearly stated: Indonesia is eager for peace.
