The Ministry of Higher Education of the People's Republic of China convened an experience exchange meeting on the mechanical parts course design for secondary vocational schools, held in Beijing from January 28th to February 1st.

At this meeting, Soviet expert Dunayev gave a report on how mechanical parts course design is organized and conducted in Soviet secondary technical schools. Representatives from the North China First Industrial School introduced their experiences in the organization, leadership, methods, and procedures of mechanical parts course design. Consultant Gu Siming of the Ministry of Higher Education provided detailed and specific answers to some difficult questions raised in the in-depth group discussions. The representatives attending the meeting also visited the physical displays of the North China First Industrial School, further clarifying the purpose, requirements, and specific practices of mechanical parts course design.

This meeting not only enabled the vast majority of industrial and a small number of agricultural and forestry schools across the country to once again specifically learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, but also deepened the understanding of a very small number of schools that had already gained preliminary experience.

The meeting unanimously passed the resolution of the experience exchange meeting on mechanical parts course design.

The basic purpose of mechanical parts course design is to cultivate students' ability to independently apply engineering mechanics theoretical knowledge and relevant technical materials to solve practical problems in calculation, drafting, and assembly of simple machine components and parts that are closely related to the major and commonly encountered. All organizational work related to mechanical parts course design must adhere to this purpose, enabling students to acquire the ability to independently apply theoretical knowledge to solve practical problems with production technology.

    高等教育部召开中等专业学校机械零件课程设计经验介绍会
    中华人民共和国高等教育部召开的中等专业学校机械零件课程设计经验介绍会，于一月二十八日到二月一日在北京举行。
    在这次会议上，苏联专家杜那也夫作了关于苏联中等技术学校如何组织与进行机械零件课程设计的报告；华北第一工业学校代表介绍了他们对机械零件课程设计的组织领导、进行方法和步骤的经验。在小组深入讨论中所提出的一些疑难问题，由高等教育部顾问顾思明作了详尽具体的解答。参加会议的代表并参观了华北第一工业学校的实物陈列，进一步明确了机械零件课程设计的目的要求与具体作法。
    这次会议不仅使全国绝大多数工业性质及少数农林学校，又一次具体地学习了苏联的先进经验；对极少数已获得初步经验的学校也加深了认识。
    会议一致通过了机械零件课程设计经验介绍会的决议。
    机械零件课程设计的基本目的在于培养学生独立地运用工程力学理论知识及有关技术资料，来解决与专业密切相关且常见的简单机器部件和零件的计算、制图、装配等方面的实际问题的能力。有关机械零件课程设计的一切组织工作都必须服从这个目的，使学生能获得运用理论知识来解决带有生产技术性的实际问题的独立工作的能力。
