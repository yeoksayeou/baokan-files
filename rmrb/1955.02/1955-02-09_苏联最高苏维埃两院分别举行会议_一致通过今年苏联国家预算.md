Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 8th:
    The Soviet Supreme Soviet's Council of the Union and Council of Nationalities held separate meetings on the 7th, concluding the discussion on the draft Soviet national budget for 1955.

    Over the three days from the 4th to the 7th, more than fifty deputies spoke at the meetings of the Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities. They unanimously agreed that the Soviet national budget for 1955 is in line with the fundamental interests of the Soviet people. This budget ensures the further improvement of the foundation of the development of all sectors of the Soviet national economy – heavy industry – and the strengthening of the Soviet defense forces, creating conditions for improving the welfare of the working people in urban and rural areas, and is in line with the tasks of the state in the final year of the Fifth Five-Year Plan. At the same time, they pointed out shortcomings in the work of certain departments and put forward many suggestions for overcoming these shortcomings.

    At the meetings of the Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities on the 7th, many deputies spoke about the development of various sectors of the Soviet national economy and culture.

    At the meeting of the Council of Nationalities, the Soviet Minister of Ferrous Metallurgy, A. Shelemetev, spoke about the achievements of the Soviet iron and steel industry. He said that compared with 1940, in 1954, the pig iron production of the factories under the Soviet Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy alone had increased by two times, steel production by 2.4 times, and steel production by 2.5 times. Metal production will be further increased this year. Therefore, the work of building new metallurgical plants and expanding existing plants is particularly important.

    At the meeting of the Council of the Union, the Soviet Minister of Chemical Industry, S. Tikhomirov, spoke about the development of Soviet mineral fertilizer production. He said that the Soviet Union is constantly increasing the production of mineral fertilizers. Last year, a number of newly established factories manufacturing nitrogen fertilizer, potash fertilizer, and superphosphate fertilizer in the Urals, Uzbekistan, and other regions were put into production. New mineral fertilizer factories are currently under construction in the South Caucasus and the Baltic republics. A huge plan has been made to continue building new giant mineral fertilizer factories.

    At the end of the discussion, the Soviet Minister of Finance, Zverev, made a concluding speech on the discussion at the meetings of the Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities respectively. He pointed out that the Soviet government agreed with the amendments made by the budget committees of the two chambers to the budget. The government will also consider the requests made by many deputies to increase appropriations for social and cultural facilities in some republics and states.

    The Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities unanimously approved the Soviet national budget for 1955. The budget revenue is stipulated to be 590,192,622,000 rubles, and the budget expenditure is 563,482,491,000 rubles.
