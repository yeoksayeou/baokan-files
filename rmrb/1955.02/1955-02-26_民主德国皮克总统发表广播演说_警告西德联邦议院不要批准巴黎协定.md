Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 25th: German Democratic Republic President Wilhelm Pieck, on the eve of the second reading debate in the West German Bundestag on the Paris Agreements, delivered a radio address warning against the ratification of the Paris Agreements.

President Pieck said: The members of the Bundestag are facing a decision of grave significance for the future of the entire German nation.

The members of the Bundestag must choose: whether to succumb to the intentions of foreign imperialists and West German militarists or to make a decision in accordance with the peace-loving will of the vast majority of the German people. For every responsible member of parliament, there can only be one decision, and that is to reject the Paris Agreements.

Pieck said: The issue today is not only about rejecting rearmament and war treaties, but also about adopting positive proposals for the peaceful reunification of Germany. Pieck reiterated that the German Democratic Republic is prepared to reach an all-German understanding and believes that this position is supported by all strata of the people of the German Democratic Republic.

President Pieck concluded by pointing out that the West German Federal Republic is unwilling to listen to the voices of the people. Therefore, a firm stance must be taken so that the people's movement against rearmament and all war preparations can develop to an extent sufficient to overcome all obstacles.

    民主德国皮克总统发表广播演说
    警告西德联邦议院不要批准巴黎协定
    【新华社二十五日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林二十四日讯：德意志民主共和国总统威廉·皮克在西德联邦议院二读辩论巴黎协定的前夕发表广播演说，警告不要批准巴黎协定。
    皮克总统说：联邦议院的议员们面临着一个对整个德国民族的前途具有严重意义的决定。
    联邦议院的议员们必须选择：是屈从于外国帝国主义者和西德军国主义者的意图还是作出符合于绝大多数德国人民的和平意志的决定。对于每一个有责任感的议员来说，只能有一个决定，那就是拒绝巴黎协定。
    皮克说：今天的问题不仅在于拒绝重新武装和战争条约，同时也在于采纳和平重新统一德国的积极建议。皮克再一次宣布，德意志民主共和国准备达成全德谅解，并且相信这一立场得到德意志民主共和国各阶层人民的支持。
    皮克总统最后指出：西德联邦共和国不愿意倾听人民的呼声。因此，必须采取坚定的立场，以便使反对重新武装和一切战争准备的人民运动开展到足以克服一切障碍的程度。
