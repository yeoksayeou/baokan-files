Maintaining National Sovereignty is the Common Demand of the Asian People
Fei Bing

The people of Asia have traveled a common historical path. When British sailors pointed their cannons at China's ancient castles during the Opium War, the elite British army was marching towards the border regions of India.

To fight for national independence and maintain national sovereignty, the people of Asia have also waged long and arduous struggles. At the same time that the vigorous Taiping Rebellion movement unfolded in China, a great uprising of soldiers and peasants broke out in India, almost driving British imperialism into the sea.

After the Second World War, a new page was turned in Asian history. Where the banners of imperialism fell, young, independent nations arose one after another.

The birth of the People's Republic of China fundamentally changed the face of Asia. The establishment of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam shook the foundations of colonialism in the East. India, Burma, and Indonesia also became independent countries through their own different paths.

The birth of these new countries has fundamentally changed international relations in Asia. The long-suffering people of Asia deeply understand the value of independence. They understand how to safeguard their own sovereignty and respect the sovereignty of other countries. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly initiated by China and India and China and Burma, begin with "mutual respect for territorial sovereignty." The Five Principles laid the foundation for new relations between Asian countries. Facts have proven that as long as the countries concerned respect each other's territorial sovereignty, do not invade each other, and do not interfere in each other's internal affairs, then, regardless of their social systems or whether they are strong or weak, they can coexist peacefully and develop independently.

But on the other hand, the United States and other colonial countries in the West are trying to continue to maintain or establish colonial rule in the Asian region. The United States and its followers organize aggressive blocs in Asia, establish military bases, implement "embargoes" and "blockades," and create various rebellions. In the final analysis, all these are intended to infringe upon the sovereignty of various countries and enslave their people.

The United States' act of aggression against Taiwan is a serious violation of the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China. Fair-minded public opinion in Asia has expressed great indignation at the American aggressors. Just as the United States is invading Taiwan, there is the issue of Portugal's occupation of Goa in India, and the issue of the Netherlands' occupation of West Irian in Indonesia, and behind both the Portuguese and Dutch colonialists, there is the manipulation of the American evil hand. In this regard, it is completely understandable that the people of Asian countries have common aspirations and feelings. Premier Zhou Enlai said when referring to the Taiwan issue: "Only by liberating Taiwan from the tyranny of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique can the Chinese people complete the complete unification of their motherland." Prime Minister Nehru also said when referring to the Goa issue: "Only after those small pieces of foreign territory that still exist have also broken away from colonial rule can the (Indian) liberation movement be completed." The Chinese people's firm will to oppose the US occupation of Taiwan, the solemn demands of India and Indonesia to safeguard national sovereignty, the tenacious struggle of the people in various Asian colonies and dependent countries to strive for independence, and the urgent desire of the Japanese people to get rid of American enslavement all have a common nature.

The United States manipulates the United Nations and forces Asian countries to implement "embargoes," which is a crude interference in the internal affairs of various countries. The United States airdropping special agents into mainland China is an attempt to help the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique carry out a restoration. The United States organizing the Southeast Asia military bloc is preparing to expand its aggression against the new China; at the same time, it is also to further interfere in the internal affairs of Southeast Asian countries.

Of course, the aggressors will try every possible means to cover up their crimes of infringing on the sovereignty of China and other Asian countries.

The American aggressive bloc propagates that there is a "latent threat" in Asia, and therefore it is necessary to take action to defend the "security" of the United States. The Southeast Asia military bloc was established under this pretext. Dulles even posed as the "protector" of the Asian people at the Manila Conference, violating the agreements of the Geneva Conference, and劃分 a large area of Indochina into the "protection" of this aggressive organization. Now, the special message from the US government once again bites down that the United States must occupy Taiwan, insisting that Taiwan and some other islands in the western Pacific constitute the "backbone of the American security structure" in the Pacific. The "security" needs of the United States are, of course, by no means limited to Taiwan. In fact, the United States occupies the territory of other countries everywhere as military bases. It all says it is for the sake of American security.

The people of Asian countries cannot tolerate the nonsense of the American aggressors. The Asian public cannot help but imagine: if the United States can draw a "defense line" on Chinese territory today, it may also demand to draw a "defense line" on the territory of India and Burma tomorrow. The Asian public recognizes from their own personal experience the harm of the US aggression against Chinese territory Taiwan to Asian and world peace. The sober-minded Asian people cannot believe the myth of the so-called "latent threat." On the contrary, the aggressive activities of the United States threaten all Asian countries. The common demands and feelings of the Asian people are being transformed into actions to support the just struggle of the Chinese people against the US aggression against Taiwan. The recent mass rally in Delhi, India, for the "US Get Out of Taiwan Day," strongly demanded that the United States stop its military interference in China's internal affairs, which is a clear proof.

The Asian people are uniting to oppose all conspiracies of the United States to occupy Chinese territory Taiwan, interfere in China's internal affairs, exacerbate the tense situation in the Far East, and prepare for a new war. The people of Asian countries understand that supporting China's struggle against the US aggression against Taiwan today is also a struggle to prevent the United States from trampling on their own national sovereignty. Today's Asia is not the Asia of the nineteenth century. The common will of the Asian people must be respected. All the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism will inevitably meet with a shameful defeat.

    维护国家主权是亚洲人民的共同要求
    费兵
    亚洲人民走过共同的历史道路。当鸦片战争中英国的水兵把炮口指向中国古老的城堡时，英国的精锐陆军正向印度的边缘地区进军。
    为了争取民族独立和维护国家主权，亚洲人民也都同样地进行过长期和艰巨的斗争。在中国展开蓬蓬勃勃的太平天国革命运动的同时，印度爆发了士兵和农民的伟大起义，使英帝国主义差一点被赶下海去。
    第二次世界大战以后，亚洲的历史展开了新的一页。在帝国主义旗帜倒下去的地方，站起来一个个年轻的独立国家。
    中华人民共和国的诞生，从根本上改变了亚洲的面貌。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和越南民主共和国的成立，动摇了殖民主义在东方的统治。印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚，也经过各自不同的道路，成为独立的国家。
    这些新国家的诞生，使亚洲的国际关系发生了根本的改变。久经蹂躏的亚洲人民，深知独立的可贵。它们懂得维护本国的主权，也懂得尊重别国的主权。中印、中缅共同倡议的五项原则，第一条就是“互相尊重领土主权”。五项原则奠定了亚洲各国之间的崭新关系。事实证明，有关各国只要互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政，那么，不论它们的社会制度如何，也不论国家强弱大小，就可以和平共处和独立发展。
    但是另一方面，美国和西方的其他殖民国家，却想继续在亚洲地区保持或建立殖民统治。美国及其追随者在亚洲组织侵略集团、建立军事基地、实行“禁运”“封锁”、制造各种叛乱，归根到底，都是要侵犯各国的主权，奴役各国的人民。
    美国对台湾的侵略行为，是对中华人民共和国主权的严重侵犯。亚洲公正舆论对美国侵略者表示了极大的愤慨。因为如同美国侵略台湾一样，在印度存在着葡萄牙侵占果阿问题，在印度尼西亚存在着荷兰侵占西伊里安问题，而无论在葡萄牙或是荷兰殖民主义者的后面，又都有着美国魔手的操纵。在这方面，亚洲各国人民具有共同的愿望和共同的感情，是完全可以理解的。周恩来总理在提到台湾问题时说：“只有把台湾从蒋介石卖国集团的暴政下解放出来，中国人民才能完成自己祖国的完全统一。”尼赫鲁总理在提到果阿问题时也说：“只有仍然存在的那些小块外国属地也脱离了殖民统治以后， （印度的）解放运动才能完成。”中国人民反对美国侵占台湾的坚强意志，印度、印度尼西亚维护国家主权的严正要求，亚洲各殖民地附属国人民争取独立的顽强斗争，以及日本人民要求摆脱美国奴役的迫切愿望，都具有共同的性质。
    美国操纵联合国，强使亚洲国家实施“禁运”，是对各国内政的粗暴干涉。美国向中国大陆空投特务，是企图帮助蒋介石卖国集团进行复辟。美国组织东南亚军事集团是准备扩大对新中国的侵略；同时也是为了进一步干涉东南亚各国内政。
    当然，侵略者不会不想尽一切办法，来掩饰它侵犯中国和亚洲各国主权的罪行。
    美国侵略集团宣传在亚洲存在着一种“潜在的威胁”，因而有必要采取行动，以保卫美国的“安全”。东南亚军事集团，就是在这种口实下建立起来的。杜勒斯并且在马尼拉会议上冒充亚洲人民的“保护人”，违反日内瓦会议的协议，把印度支那的一大块地区划进这个侵略组织的“保护”之内。现在，美国政府的特别咨文，又一口咬定美国必须侵占台湾，硬说台湾和西太平洋上的一些其他岛屿，构成了美国在太平洋上的“安全结构的骨干”。美国的“安全”需要，当然决不以台湾为限。事实上美国到处占据别国的领土作为军事基地。它都说是为了美国的安全。
    亚洲各国人民不能容忍美国侵略者的一派胡说。亚洲各国公众不能不这样设想：如果美国今天可以在中国的领土上划出一条“防线”，它明天也可能要求在印度、缅甸的领土上划出一条“防线”。亚洲各国公众从自己的亲身体验，认识到美国侵略中国领土台湾对亚洲和世界和平的危害。清醒的亚洲人民不能相信美国所谓“潜在的威胁”的神话，恰恰相反，美国的侵略活动，威胁到所有的亚洲国家。亚洲人民的共同要求和感情，正在转化为支持中国人民反对美国侵略台湾的正义斗争的行动。最近印度德里举行美国“撤出台湾日”群众大会，强烈要求制止美国对中国内政的军事干涉，就是一个明证。
    亚洲人民正在团结起来，反对美国侵占中国领土台湾、干涉中国内政、加剧远东紧张局势并准备新的战争的一切阴谋。亚洲各国人民懂得，今天支持中国反对美国侵略台湾的斗争，也正是为了防止美国蹂躏自己国家主权的斗争。今天的亚洲已不是十九世纪的亚洲。亚洲人民的共同意志必须得到尊重。帝国主义的一切阴谋诡计，必然会遭到可耻的失败。
