    Sailor Warriors on Landing Craft
  　Lu Qiming
    Our landing craft team, divided into several routes, advanced rapidly towards various landing zones. As the engine noise gradually increased, the bows of each craft slowly rose, and the landing craft team was approaching Yijiangshan Island.

    When the leading landing craft team was only a few hundred meters from Yijiangshan Island, a commander of a certain craft team picked up the radio with his left hand and pointed to the landing zone with his right hand: "All boat captains pay attention to your landing points!"

    Looking in the direction pointed by the commander, the terrain ahead was extremely treacherous. It was full of reefs. One landing point had reefs extending into the sea on both sides, and the front was a cliff more than two zhang high (approximately 6-7 meters), with no road and not a single plant. The base of the mountain extending into the sea on its right side was about five chi wide (approximately 1.6 meters). From the landing craft, one could vaguely see the sea water hitting many sharp rocks protruding from the water. If the steering was slightly off, the landing craft would be in danger of capsizing in the sea.

    The craft team had entered the enemy's firing range. The sailors pointed their cannons at the surroundings of the landing point, vigilantly searching for the enemy's bunkers and firing points, ready to fire fiercely as soon as the enemy opened fire. They were only thirty meters away from the landing point, but the cunning enemy still did not fire a shot.

    The landing craft team was only ten meters away from the landing point. Suddenly, the enemy's various weapons fired fiercely from various crevices, behind the cliffs, from top to bottom, at the command platforms and sailors on the decks of the landing craft. The sailors on the deck were immediately attacked from three sides: left, right, and front. If the sailors could not suppress the enemy's firepower at the landing point under such intense fire and eliminate the enemy, it would be difficult for the army to land on the island.

    All the cannons and bullets on all the landing craft fired fiercely at the enemy. Gunner Zhang Yishan was hit and fell on the craft after destroying an enemy bunker. Ammunition handler Wei Fugen immediately took over and aimed the cannon at another bunker and fired fiercely. Suddenly, he was also wounded, but he gritted his teeth and insisted on shooting. An army soldier sitting in the cabin immediately ran to the hatch and asked the captain standing in front of the bridge:
      "Navy commander comrade, please allow us to come up and fight!"
    "No, this is the task of us sailors. It's your task after landing!"

    The landing craft bravely sailed towards the various landing points. The enemy fired more intensive fire at the landing craft's bridge, attempting to make the landing craft lose control. But our helmsman, Shen Jin'an, still stared at the landing point with both eyes and gripped the steering wheel tightly, firmly steering. A group of bullets fired by the enemy shattered the glass around him, and a piece of shrapnel injured his eyelid. He instinctively turned his body to one side, but still calmly gripped the control lever.

    The gates of each landing craft opened. Fully armed army soldiers were ready to charge, their eyes fixed on the gates. At this time, the enemy's various firepower was firing at the gate of the landing craft, attempting to block the army on the landing craft.

    The fierce battle to break through the reefs and land immediately began.

      At this crucial moment, the sailors showed great bravery.

    When the gate of the landing craft was about to rest on the rocks, gunner Li Deyun saw five or six enemies crawling out from behind the cliff on the left, throwing grenades at the gate of the landing craft. He immediately swept a burst of bullets, and three enemies immediately fell from the cliff. The remaining enemies scurried back to the bunker. The machine guns in the two enemy bunkers in front and on the left were firing at the army soldiers who were landing. Sailor Yu He immediately fired a string of shells, overturning the machine gun in front, and then he pointed the cannon at the bunker on the left, and in a few seconds, the bunker was also smoking black. As soon as the gate of the landing craft rested on the landing point, the sailors shouted:
      "Army comrades, we will cover you, charge!"
    "Wish you great success!"

    At this time, the sailors on the craft jumped onto the deck, holding various weapons and firing fiercely at the enemy, sealing off the enemy's bunker eyes and suppressing the enemy's firepower. Mao Zhangren held a light machine gun and took a stride to the front deck, fiercely firing at a bunker hole. Mechanic Xu Shiqing climbed out of the engine room. When he saw that the enemies in two bunkers were strafing the army soldiers, he picked up a machine gun and silenced one bunker, and then sealed off another bunker. The clerk, medical orderly, and signalman on the craft also held guns and fired fiercely at the enemy.

    The army soldiers quickly climbed over the treacherous stone reefs and launched a fierce attack on the enemy in the mountains.

    As the army soldiers advanced towards the mountains, the artillery fire on the landing craft also extended upward. Two army soldiers were climbing towards the cliff when a burst of enemy bullets hit between the two soldiers. When sailor Wang Shengcai saw this, he saw an enemy machine gun on the upper right aiming at the two soldiers. He immediately adjusted the machine gun and swept towards the enemy, destroying the machine gun with a burst of bullets. When he turned back to look at the two soldiers, they had already climbed more than two hundred meters. In another place, an army soldier was sniped by the enemy while climbing towards an enemy bunker. Sailor Luo Jincai adjusted the cannon and silenced the bunker with only four shells.

    While the army soldiers on the first batch of landing craft were advancing towards the enemy's deep positions on Yijiangshan Island, the landing craft behind them transported the army troops to the island to join the battle. At this time, the army soldiers in front had already escorted batches of prisoners onto the craft. The landing craft, carrying the prisoners, and the sailors began to return with a victorious mood.

    登陆艇上的水兵勇士
  　陆其明
    我军的登陆艇队，分成数路迅速地向着各个登陆地段前进。随着逐渐增大的机器声，各艇的船头慢慢地昂了起来，登陆艇队快靠近一江山岛了。
    前面的一批登陆艇队离一江山岛只有几百公尺的时候，某艇队指挥员左手拿起报话器，右手向登陆地段一指：“各艇长注意自己的登陆点！”
    顺着指挥员所指的方向望去，前面的地形十分险恶。那里礁石丛生。有一个登陆点的两侧是伸入海面的礁石，正面凹进去的地方是一块两丈多高的悬崖，没有路，也没有一根草木。它右面伸入海里的那条山脚约有五尺宽。从登陆艇上，可以隐约望见海水正拍打着那里许多伸出水面的尖锐的石块。如果操舵稍有差错，登陆艇就有倾翻在海里的危险。
    艇队已经进入敌人的火力网了。水兵们把炮口对着登陆点的周围，机警地搜索着敌人的地堡和火力点，准备敌人一开火就猛烈地进行射击。离开登陆点只有三十多公尺了，但是狡猾的敌人还是一枪不放。
    登陆艇队离登陆点只有十来公尺了。突然，敌人的各种武器从各个石缝里、崖石后，由上而下地向着各登陆艇的指挥台和舱面上的水兵们猛烈地射击。舱面上的水兵们顿时受到了左、右和正面的三面夹击。水兵们如果不能在这样激烈的火力下把登陆点上敌人的火力压住，并把敌人消灭掉，陆军部队就难以登上海岛。
    所有登陆艇上各种炮火和枪弹，一齐猛烈地向着敌人射去。炮手张义山在摧毁了敌人的一个碉堡后中弹倒在艇上，运弹手魏福根立刻接上去将炮口对准另一个碉堡猛打，突然他也负了伤，但他咬牙坚持着射击。坐在舱里的一位陆军战士马上跑到舱口，向站在驾驶台前的艇长要求：
      “海军指挥员同志，请允许我们上来打！”
    “不能，这是我们水兵的任务。登了陆后才是你们的任务！”
    登陆艇勇猛地向着各个登陆点驶去。敌人向登陆艇的驾驶台射来更加密集的火力，妄想使登陆艇失去操纵。但我们的舵手沈金安，仍然两眼盯着登陆点，两手紧握着舵盘，坚定地驾驶着。敌人射来的一群子弹把他周围的玻璃打得粉碎，一块弹片打伤了他的眼皮，他本能地把身体一侧，还是沉着地紧握着操纵杆。
    各登陆艇的大门开开了。全副武装的陆军战士都已准备好冲锋，他们的眼睛直望着大门。这时，敌人的各种火力都向登陆艇的大门口打来，企图把陆军堵在登陆艇上。
    登陆突破礁头的激烈战斗随即展开了。
      在这决定的时刻，水兵们都表现了高度的勇敢。
    登陆艇的大门快要搁上岩石的时候，炮手李德云看见左面的悬崖后面爬出来五、六个敌人，向着登陆艇的大门口丢手榴弹。他马上扫过去一梭子子弹，立刻有三个敌人从山崖上摔了下来，其余的敌人都窜回了碉堡。正面和左面的两个敌人碉堡里的机枪，向正在登陆的陆军战士射击。水兵于和立刻打过去一串炮弹，把正面的一个机枪打翻了，接着他把炮口指向左面的碉堡，不到几秒钟，就打得这个碉堡也冒出了黑烟。登陆艇的大门一搁上登陆点，水兵们就高喊着：
      “陆军战友们，我们掩护你们，冲呀！”
    “祝你们立大功！”
    这时，艇上的水兵都跳上甲板，拿着各种武器向敌人猛烈射击，封锁敌人的碉堡眼，压制住敌人的火力。茅章仁端了一支轻机枪，一个箭步跳上前甲板，对准一个碉堡孔猛烈地发射着。轮机兵徐士清从机舱里爬出来，他看到有两个碉堡里的敌人正在对陆军战士扫射，就拿起机枪打哑了一个碉堡，接着又封锁住了另一个碉堡。艇上的文书、医务员、讯号兵也都端着枪，向敌人猛烈射击。
    陆军战士们迅速地爬过险恶的石礁，向山上的敌人猛攻。
    随着陆军战士向着山上前进，登陆艇上的炮火也向上延伸射击。有两个陆军战士向着悬崖上爬去，敌人的一梭子弹正打在这两个战士的中间。水兵王胜才一看，在右上方有一挺敌人的机枪正向这两个战士瞄准着。他马上调过机枪口向敌人扫过去，用一梭子子弹就把这挺机枪打毁了。等他回过头来再看这两个战士时，他们已爬上二百多公尺了。在另一个地方，有一个陆军战士在爬向一个敌人的碉堡时遭到了敌人的狙击。水兵骆金才调过炮口，只用四发炮弹就打哑了这个碉堡。
    当乘坐第一批登陆艇的陆军战士们正向一江山岛敌人纵深阵地前进的时候，后面来的登陆艇又将陆军部队运上海岛投入战斗。这时候，前面的陆军战士已经押着一批批俘虏送上艇来。登陆艇载着俘虏，水兵们怀着胜利的心情开始返航。（新华社）
