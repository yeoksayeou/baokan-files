Xinhua News Agency, February 4th dispatch: Paris news: On the evening of February 3rd, French Prime Minister Mendes-France requested a vote of confidence in the National Assembly regarding the government's North Africa policy. This vote will be held late on the 4th (Paris time). This is the eleventh time the Mendes-France cabinet, which has been reorganized five times in the seven months since taking office, has raised the question of confidence.

The direct cause of this vote of confidence is the widespread dissatisfaction in parliament, from the left to the right, with the government's North Africa policy. However, many commentators in Paris newspapers point out that, more importantly, since the government openly and stubbornly pursued the policy of arming West Germany and following Washington's instructions, its prestige at home has steadily declined.

The National Assembly's debate on the North Africa issue began on the 2nd. Before the debate began, Mendes-France himself expressed unease, saying, "The North Africa issue has caused widespread shock and even indignation in all circles, which is very likely to threaten the fate of the government."

The debate unfolded in a tense atmosphere. Those who spoke during the two days expressed dissatisfaction with the government's measures in North Africa. Paris newspapers particularly noted that Reynaud Mayer, a leading figure in Mendes-France's own party, the Radical Socialist Party, also used this opportunity to attack Mendes-France. "Le Parisien Libéré" said: The parliamentary opposition, which wants to overthrow the cabinet, hopes to gain support from the various parties that make up the government majority, and the fate of the cabinet is in the hands of the Radical Socialist Party.

Xinhua News Agency, February 5th dispatch: Paris news: In a vote of confidence held in the French National Assembly on the morning of February 5th after a debate on North Africa policy, a clear majority of 319 votes to 273 expressed no confidence in the Mendes-France government. Mendes-France, who had been in power for seven and a half months, immediately submitted his resignation to French President Coty.

The direct cause of this vote of no confidence was the opposition of all parties in the parliament to the Mendes-France government's North Africa policy. In the three-day debate on the North Africa issue in the National Assembly, most of the speakers vehemently attacked the government. Members of the French Communist Party resolutely denounced the government's colonial policy in North Africa as violating the interests of the French people, while right-wing members representing colonial interests attacked the government's policy as "insufficient" to suppress the national liberation movement of the North African people. In fact, the reasons for the downfall of the Mendes-France government go far beyond the scope of the North Africa policy issue. French Communist Party member Robert Ballanger pointed out in his speech on the evening of the 4th that this vote of confidence not only involved the North Africa issue but also the government's entire policy. He said that the overall policy of the Mendes-France government had aroused dissatisfaction throughout the country. He emphasized that French patriots believed that Mendes-France, who signed the Paris Accords, was "the person who rearmed Germany." According to the Associated Press, Mendes-France himself and other speakers also believed that "the result of the vote of confidence was an expression of opinion on the government's general policy."

When Mendes-France organized a cabinet in June last year, using the achievement of the Indochina armistice at the Geneva Conference as a slogan, and asked the National Assembly to express its confidence, he obtained an absolute majority of 408 votes, the broadest support a French government had received in many years. However, since then, due to his adoption of policies that violated the interests of the French people, especially the policy of rearming West Germany, his government has become increasingly unpopular. In the nine votes of confidence he successively put forward, the majority Mendes-France obtained decreased each time. Although he reorganized the cabinet five times, co-opting various right-wing parties into the cabinet, he could not change this trend, and finally fell in the eleventh vote of confidence.

The downfall of the Mendes-France government, as an active advocate of the policy of arming West Germany and a symbol of the Paris Accords, has caused unease in Western countries. According to United Press, London diplomatic observers believe that this has put the fate of the West European Union, which is arming West Germany, "in danger." United Press quoted "well-informed sources" as saying that the ratification of the Paris Accords would be delayed in any case. At the same time, according to a United Press Bonn dispatch, the collapse of Mendes-France made the West German government feel "shocked and frustrated." Bonn officials generally believe that the prospects for the Paris Accords are "bleak."

### 法国议会就北非问题通过对政府不信任案  日益不得人心的孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府倒台

    法国议会就北非问题通过对政府不信任案
    日益不得人心的孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府倒台
    【新华社四日讯】巴黎消息：二月三日晚间，法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯在国民议会中要求就政府的北非政策举行信任投票。这项投票将在四日深夜（巴黎时间）举行。这是上台七个月改组了五次的孟戴斯—弗朗斯内阁第十一次提出信任问题。
    这次信任案的提出，直接原因是政府北非政策引起了议会中从左派到右派普遍的不满。但是，许多巴黎报纸的评论员指出：更重要的是，自从政府公开顽固地执行武装西德和听从华盛顿指示的政策以来，它在国内的威信就不断下降了。
    国民议会关于北非问题的辩论是在二日开始的。在辩论开始以前，孟戴斯—弗朗斯本人就表示不安，他说：“北非问题在各界人士中引起了普遍的震动甚至愤慨，这十分可能使政府的命运遭到威胁”。
    辩论在紧张的气氛中展开。两天中发言的人都对政府在北非的措施表示不满。巴黎报纸特别注意到：孟戴斯—弗朗斯自己的党——激进社会党的领袖人物雷纳·迈耶也利用这个机会攻击孟戴斯—弗朗斯。“解放了的巴黎人报”说：想推翻内阁的议会反对派希望从构成政府多数的各党派中得到支持，内阁命运是掌握在激进社会党手中的。
    【新华社五日讯】巴黎消息：法国国民议会五日清晨在关于北非政策的辩论结束后举行的信任投票中，以三百一十九票对二百七十三票的绝对多数对孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府表示不信任。执政七个半月的孟戴斯—弗朗斯已随即向法国总统戈蒂提出辞职。
    触发这次不信任投票的直接原因是孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府的北非政策遭到了议会各党派的反对。在国民议会关于北非问题的三天辩论中，大多数发言的议员都猛烈攻击政府。法国共产党的议员坚决斥责政府在北非的殖民政策违反法国人民的利益，而代表殖民利益的右派议员则攻击政府的政策还“不足以”镇压北非人民的民族解放运动。实际上，造成孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府倒台的原因还远远超出北非政策问题的范围以外。法国共产党议员罗伯·巴朗歇在四日晚间的发言中指出，这一次的信任投票不仅涉及北非问题，而且涉及政府的整个政策。他说，孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府的总政策已在全国各地激起了不满。他强调指出法国爱国人士认为签订了巴黎协定的孟戴斯—弗朗斯是“重新武装德国的人”。据美联社报道说，孟戴斯—弗朗斯本人和其他发言的人也都认为，“信任投票的结果是对于政府总政策的意见的一种表示”。
    当孟戴斯—弗朗斯以在日内瓦会议上达成印度支那停战为口号而在去年六月间组织内阁要求国民议会表示信任的时候，他曾获得四百零八票的绝对多数，得到了多年来法国政府所获得的最广泛的支持。但是，在此以后，由于他采取了违反法国人民利益的政策，特别是采取了重新武装西德的政策，他的政府就日益不得人心。在他接连提出的九次信任投票中，孟戴斯—弗朗斯所得到的多数一次比一次减少。虽然他五次改组内阁，拉拢各右翼党派入阁，也不能改变这种趋势，而最后终于在第十
  一次信任投票中倒了台。
    作为武装西德政策的积极鼓吹者和巴黎协定的象征的孟戴斯—弗朗斯政府的倒台已在西方国家中间引起不安。据合众社报道，伦敦外交观察家认为，这样一来已使得武装西德的西欧联盟的命运“处在危险之中”。合众社引用“消息灵通人士”的话说，不论怎样也会拖延巴黎协定的批准。同时，据合众社波恩消息，孟戴斯—弗朗斯的垮台使西德政府感到“震惊和沮丧”。波恩官员一般认为巴黎协定的前景是“黑暗的”。
