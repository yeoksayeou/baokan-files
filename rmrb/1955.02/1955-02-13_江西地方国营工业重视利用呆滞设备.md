Jiangxi Local State-Owned Industries Emphasize Utilizing Idle Equipment
Hou Bingheng, Head of the Basic Construction Section, Jiangxi Provincial Department of Industry

Jiangxi local state-owned industries bear a significant responsibility during the national construction period. However, to concentrate efforts on developing heavy industry, the state cannot make large investments in local industrial construction. Nevertheless, Jiangxi local state-owned industries have still achieved considerable and rapid development in recent years. One of the sources of equipment for building these industries is the full utilization of the large amounts of idle equipment and materials accumulated in warehouses.

Many state-owned factories and mines in Jiangxi Province have various idle equipment and materials stockpiled in their warehouses. Some of these materials are legacies from old enterprises, while others are discarded items dismantled from existing factories. Over the past few years, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Industry has made great efforts to fully utilize these idle equipment and materials, save state investment, build local industries, and increase local industrial production, and has achieved remarkable results. For example, Jiangxi Province had only twenty-one small power plants before liberation. After liberation, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Industry utilized all the province's original idle power generation equipment. Now it has developed into seventy-six medium and small power plants, basically meeting the needs of industry, lighting, culture, and hygiene in towns and cities above the county level. For instance, in the two years from 1953 to 1954, four sets of old power generation equipment totaling 1,200 kilowatts were used to build the auxiliary power plants of the Tianhe and Zhongjiashan coal mines, saving the state 6.8 billion yuan in investment. Moreover, these two coal mines have basically moved towards mechanized production, guaranteeing the task of producing 200,000 tons of bituminous coal annually. The working conditions of the workers underground have also greatly improved. The coal produced by these two coal mines can not only guarantee the needs of industry and civilian coal in Jiangxi Province, but also supply the industrial coal needs of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. In addition, the utilization of idle equipment and materials to expand some factories has played a significant role in manufacturing agricultural tools, increasing the production of daily necessities for farmers, and promoting the development of rural cultural and health undertakings.

This year, the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Industry is still striving to use a large number of idle materials to build local industries. For example, the Jingdezhen Power Plant, built using old generators, boilers, transformers, copper wires, and other idle materials, will not only save the state over 3 billion yuan in investment and revitalize over 2 billion yuan worth of idle materials; but will also change the centuries-old manual production methods of the "Porcelain Capital," gradually moving towards mechanization. At the same time, it will also play an important role in rapidly expanding the production of daily-use porcelain, improving the quality of daily-use porcelain, improving the labor conditions of workers, increasing labor productivity, reducing product costs, and meeting domestic and foreign needs.

The experience of the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Industry in utilizing idle materials in basic construction work over the past two years proves that: First, it is necessary to actively educate cadres and technical personnel in the spirit of the Party's general line during the transition period, correctly recognize the important role of old equipment, idle equipment, and materials, patiently persuade and help those technical personnel who lack confidence to overcome difficulties, and boldly and accurately carry out construction. The erroneous thinking of looking down on "old and backward equipment" and favoring the new over the old should be criticized, so as to achieve "making the best use of everything." Therefore, it is necessary to vigorously organize cadres to conduct on-site investigations of the idle materials in existing factories, register them in detail, classify them, distinguish between useful and useless, take good care of them, and then conduct specialized research, and extensively organize material exchange work between factories, departments, and provinces, so that useful state materials can be revived as soon as possible to increase the production capacity of local industries.

Second, the applications and purchasing work of basic construction units must be strictly reviewed. This can not only eliminate blind ordering and reduce material backlog, but also study the situation from it, and try to use idle materials to avoid wasting state investment and increase state revenue.

Third, the past usage of the idle equipment and materials being utilized must be carefully investigated, technical measurements must be given, or go to factories with the same equipment to learn, in order to understand the performance of the machine, and try to improve it technically to make it reasonable and safe, so as to avoid unnecessary losses in quality and maintenance in future production due to blindly believing in old materials.

    江西地方国营工业重视利用呆滞设备
    江西省工业厅基本建设科科长　侯秉衡
    江西地方国营工业在国家建设时期担负着很大的任务，但国家为了集中力量发展重工业，又不能对地方工业建设作大量的投资。可是江西地方国营工业这几年来仍然有了相当快的发展，他们建设这些工业的设备来源之一，就是充分地利用了堆积在仓库里的大量呆滞设备和器材。
    江西许多国营工厂和矿山企业的仓库里，堆存着各种呆滞设备和器材。这些器材有的是旧企业遗留下来的，有些是从现有工厂拆下来的废品。几年来，江西省工业厅对充分利用这些呆滞设备和器材，节省国家投资，建设地方工业，增加地方工业生产，作了很大的努力，并取得了显著的成绩。譬如江西省在解放前仅有二十一个小电厂，解放后江西省工业厅便把该省原有的呆滞发电设备都利用起来了，现在已发展到七十六个中、小型电厂，基本上满足了县城以上镇市附近的工业、照明、文化卫生等方面的需要。如一九五三到一九五四的两年中利用了四部旧的发电设备共一二○○瓩，建设了天河和钟家山两个煤矿的附属发电厂，给国家节约了六十八亿元的投资，而且使这两个煤矿基本上走向生产机械化，保证了年产二十万吨烟煤的任务，工人井下作业条件也有很大的改善，这两个煤矿所生产的煤不仅能保证江西省的工业和民用煤的需要，而且还可以供给长江中流部分工业用煤的需要。此外，如利用呆滞设备和器材扩建了一些工厂，对制造农具，增产农民生活日用品，促进农村文化卫生事业的发展等方面，都起了重大的作用。
    今年江西省工业厅仍努力使用大批呆滞物资建设地方工业，如利用旧发电机、锅炉、变压器、铜线等呆滞物资建设的景德镇电厂，它不仅能给国家节约三十余亿元的投资，复活呆滞物资二十余亿元；而且将使“瓷都”千余年来一向使用手工业生产的方法得到改变，逐渐走向机械化。同时也对迅速扩大日用瓷生产，提高日用瓷质量，改善职工劳动条件，提高劳动生产率，降低产品成本，满足国内外需要等各方面，起着重要的作用。
    江西省工业厅过去两年来基本建设工作中利用呆滞物资的经验证明：首先，必须根据党在过渡时期总路线的精神积极教育干部和技术人员，正确认识旧的设备、呆滞设备及器材的重要作用，耐心说服和设法帮助那些信心不足的技术人员克服困难，大胆精确的进行建设，对轻视“旧设备落后”，而喜新厌旧的错误思想应该给以批判，作到“物尽其用”。因此，必须大力组织干部实地调查现有各厂的呆滞物资，详细登记，分类排队，区别有用与无用，加以妥善保管，然后进行专门研究，广泛的组织厂与厂，部门与部门，省与省之间的物资交流工作，使有用的国家物资及早的复活起来，以增加地方工业的生产能力。
    其次，对基本建设单位的申请和购买物资工作，必须加以严格审查，这不但能杜绝盲目订货减少物资积压；而且还可以从中研究情况，设法利用呆滞物资，以避免浪费国家投资，并能增加国家收入。
    第三，对利用的呆滞设备和器材，必须认真调查其过去使用情况，给以技术测定，或者到有同样设备的工厂去进行学习，以便了解机器的性能，尽量在技术上改良，使之合理而又安全，以避免因盲目相信旧有材料而给以后生产造成质量上和维护上不应有的损失。
