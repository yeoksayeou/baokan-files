    (I) Resolutely Safeguard the Implementation of the Geneva Accords
    The statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the 22nd solemnly expresses its resolute opposition to the Bangkok Conference and strongly protests the activities of the American imperialists in undermining the Geneva Armistice Agreements. The Chinese people fully support this statement.
    Since the Geneva Conference, the American aggressive bloc has been doing everything possible to undermine the Geneva Accords, which are based on recognizing the national rights of the Indochinese people, restoring peace in Indochina, and guaranteeing the unification of Vietnam through free and democratic general elections. The Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, established under the planning of the United States, openly violates the provisions of the Geneva Accords by including South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia within its so-called "protection" zone. Now, the United States is hastily convening the Bangkok Conference, attempting to use this conference to further undermine the Geneva Accords and planning to drag South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia into the Southeast Asia military aggressive bloc, obstructing Vietnam from achieving unification through free and democratic general elections. The United States is also attempting to reorganize "joint action" to undermine peace in Indochina, create new tensions in the Far East, in order to accelerate preparations for a new war and expand its aggression against Asia. At the end of last year, Dulles blatantly stated at a press conference that the Indochina armistice was a "setback" and that the Southeast Asia Treaty "if fully implemented, could limit the scale and consequences of this loss." This fully confirms the evil intentions of the United States.
    Precisely for this purpose, the United States, on the one hand, is planning to equip the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc with "teeth," and on the other hand, is intensifying its activities to interfere in the Indochina situation. The Collins Plan, recently approved and implemented by the U.S. government, is a thorough plan to prepare for the resumption of war in Indochina. This plan seeks to use American military and financial assistance to increase the military strength of South Vietnam, obstruct the unification of Vietnam, and turn South Vietnam into an American colony and military base. At the same time, the United States is also stepping up its activities to undermine the Geneva Accords in Cambodia and Laos.
    Due to these activities of the United States, the situation in Indochina is extremely unstable, threatening peace in Southeast Asia. It is evident that the convening of the Bangkok Conference, with one of its main purposes being to expand interference in the Indochina situation, will only increase the dangers to peace inherent in the current situation. Therefore, peace-loving people of all countries, especially the people of Asia, oppose this war plan. The statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam expresses the common condemnation of the American war policy by the people of all countries.
    The American conspiracy to undermine the Indochina armistice seriously violates the provisions of the final declaration of the Geneva Conference and the armistice agreements on the three countries of Indochina. This is a serious act of betrayal and harm to peace by the United States. The United States itself knows that its evil activities will arouse strong opposition from the people of all countries, so it is trying to drag a few countries that are still following American policies to share the responsibility; and the fact that the United States has dragged Britain and France into the Southeast Asia Treaty and the Bangkok Conference is precisely for this purpose.
    While carrying out this serious activity of conspiring to undermine peace, the United States is also clamoring about the "danger of communist aggression" to cover up its own evil actions in preparing for a new war. However, this cliché, borrowed from Goebbels' anti-communist arsenal, cannot deceive anyone with a clear mind. All peace-loving countries and people will not allow the United States to undermine peace in Indochina. The Prime Ministers of India, Indonesia, Burma, Pakistan, and Ceylon, at the Bogor Conference held last December, expressed the hope that the Geneva Accords would be fully respected and implemented by all parties concerned, and that no external interference would hinder the successful implementation of these agreements. This legitimate aspiration is the common aspiration of all peace-loving people.
    The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, as well as the Laotian and Cambodian resistance governments, have correctly and earnestly implemented the Geneva Armistice Agreements. The Council of Ministers of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has recently taken active measures to re-establish relations in all aspects between the north and south of Vietnam. All of this has been warmly supported by the people of Indochina and praised by international public opinion. The struggle of the Indochinese people to resolutely oppose the interference and aggression of American imperialism, to safeguard the implementation of the Geneva Accords, and to guarantee peace in Indochina, is a just cause that receives international sympathy and support. The American war plan will ultimately be defeated.

### （一）坚决维护日内瓦协议的实施

    （一）坚决维护日内瓦协议的实施
    越南民主共和国外交部二十二日发表的声明，严正表示坚决反对曼谷会议，并强烈抗议美帝国主义者破坏日内瓦停战协定的活动。中国人民完全支持这个声明。
    自从日内瓦会议以来，美国侵略集团对于在承认印度支那人民的民族权利的基础上恢复印度支那和平、保证越南通过自由民主的普选获得统一的日内瓦协定，一直是用千方百计加以破坏的。在美国的策划之下建立的东南亚侵略集团，公然违反日内瓦协定的规定，把南越、老挝和柬埔寨划入它的所谓
  “保护”区内，现在美国又匆匆忙忙召开曼谷会议，想利用这个会议来进一步破坏日内瓦协定，打算把南越、老挝和柬埔寨拉进东南亚军事侵略集团，阻挠越南通过自由和民主的普选取得统一。美国并且企图重新组织“联合行动”来破坏印度支那的和平，制造远东新的紧张局势，以便加速准备新的战争，扩大对亚洲的侵略。去年年终，杜勒斯在记者招待会上就露骨地说，印度支那停战是一个“挫折”，东南亚条约“如果充分付诸实施就能够限制这个损失的规模和后果”。这就完全证实了美国的罪恶目的。
    正是为了这个目的，美国一面策划把东南亚侵略集团装上“牙齿”，一面加紧进行干涉印度支那局势的活动。最近美国政府批准并开始实行的柯林斯计划，就是彻头彻尾的准备在印度支那恢复战争的计划。这个计划要用美国军事和财政的援助，增加南越军事力量，阻挠越南的统一，把南越变为美国的殖民地和军事基地。同时，美国也加紧在柬埔寨和老挝进行破坏日内瓦协定的活动。
    由于美国的这些活动，使得印度支那的局势极不稳定，威胁着东南亚的和平。显而易见，以扩大干涉印度支那局势为其主要目的之一的曼谷会议的召开，只会增加目前局势所包含的对和平的危险。因此，各国爱好和平的人民，特别是亚洲的人民，都反对这种战争策划。越南民主共和国外交部的声明，表达了各国人民对美国的战争政策的共同谴责。
    美国破坏印度支那停战的阴谋活动，严重地违反日内瓦会议最后宣言和关于印度支那三国的停战协定的规定。这是美国背信弃义、危害和平的严重行为。美国自己知道它的这种罪恶活动将会引起各国人民的强烈反对，因此它极力要拉上几个还在追随美国政策的国家替它分担责任；而美国拉上英国和法国参加东南亚条约和曼谷会议，就正是为了这个目的。
    美国在进行它这种阴谋破坏和平的严重活动的同时，还大叫大嚷什么“共产党侵略的危险”，以掩护它自己准备新战争的罪恶行为。但是，这种从戈培尔反共武器库中搬来的陈辞滥调，是欺骗不了任何头脑清醒的人的。所有爱好和平的国家和人民都不会容许美国破坏印度支那和平。印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、巴基斯坦和锡兰五国总理在去年十二月举行的茂物会议，表示希望日内瓦协定将受到所有有关方面的充分尊重和履行，并且希望不会有外来的干涉阻碍成功地履行这些协定。这个正当的愿望，正是一切爱好和平人民的共同愿望。
    越南民主共和国政府以及寮国和高棉抗战政府，都正确地认真地履行日内瓦停战协定。越南民主共和国部长会议最近并为重新建立越南南北两部之间的各方面关系，采取了积极的措施。这一切都得到了印度支那人民的热烈拥护和国际公众舆论的赞誉。印度支那人民坚决反对美帝国主义的干涉和侵略活动，维护日内瓦协议的实施，保障印度支那和平的斗争，是正义的事业，是得到国际的同情和支持的，美国的战争计划终将被击败。
