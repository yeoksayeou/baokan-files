Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 14th: News from Laos says that the Lao political conference is still in a state of standstill.

On February 2nd, Phoumi Vongvichit, head of the political delegation of the Lao Fighting Forces, met with Phouma, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense of the Lao Kingdom Government, on the Plain of Jars. Phoumi reiterated the Lao Fighting Forces' position of advocating cooperation and negotiation to strive for peace and unification in Laos.

Phoumi pointed out that after the ceasefire, in the interests of the nation and to implement the ceasefire agreement, the Lao Fighting Forces withdrew from the vast liberated areas and concentrated in the two provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly, waiting for a political solution to achieve national unification. However, the Lao Kingdom Government created difficulties for the Lao Fighting Forces' concentration, and invaded and attacked the Lao Fighting Forces' concentration areas, and took repressive and retaliatory actions against those who had participated in the war of resistance in the other ten provinces. These actions by the Lao Kingdom Government are in violation of the Geneva Accords.

Phoumi said that the Lao Fighting Forces have strictly abided by the ceasefire agreement. The Lao Fighting Forces have made every effort to avoid any conflict; at the same time, it has clearly expressed its willingness to sincerely cooperate with the Kingdom Government to hold political conferences and achieve the unification of Laos through free general elections. Thanks to the efforts of the Lao Fighting Forces, negotiations have begun.

Phoumi pointed out that, however, the negotiations encountered difficulties from the very beginning. The Kingdom Government delegation refused to hold the meeting at Kang Khai, the location originally agreed upon by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom Government and Prince Souphanouvong. Due to the conciliatory spirit of the Lao Fighting Forces delegation, the political conference began on the Plain of Jars. However, after the conference was convened, the Kingdom Government delegation created difficulties for the progress of the conference, and even left the meeting, causing the negotiations to be interrupted. Commandos of the Kingdom Government also attacked the concentration areas of the Fighting Forces, creating a tense situation.

Phoumi expressed the hope that the Kingdom Government would cease provocative actions, especially military offensives against the Lao Fighting Forces in the two provinces of Sam Neua and Phongsaly, to create favorable conditions for the political conference.

Phoumi pointed out that the basic point for a comprehensive solution to political problems is to establish a political consultative committee, grant it the necessary powers, and entrust it with the necessary tasks, especially the task of preparing for free general elections throughout the country to achieve national unification.

Phoumi concluded by saying that in order to consolidate peace, achieve democratic unification and complete independence, the Lao Fighting Forces delegation hopes that both sides will strengthen mutual understanding and conduct consultations in a spirit of sincere cooperation to implement the Geneva Accords so that the political conference can quickly achieve good results.

According to reports, on February 3rd, the Lao Kingdom Government political delegation held a meeting with the Lao Fighting Forces political delegation on the Plain of Jars. However, the Lao Kingdom Government delegation has not changed its attitude, and the meeting therefore did not yield any results.

    寮国战斗部队代表指责王国政府中断协商
    【新华社河内十四日电】据老挝来的消息说，老挝政治会议还处于停顿状态中。
    二月二日，寮国战斗部队政治代表团团长富米曾在查尔平原会见了老挝王国政府副首相兼国防大臣富马。富米再度表明了寮国战斗部队主张合作和协商，争取老挝的和平和统一的立场。
    富米指出，停战以后，寮国战斗部队为了国家利益和执行停战协定，撤离了广大的解放区，集结到桑怒、丰沙里两省，等待实现国家统一的政治解决。但是老挝王国政府却给寮国战斗部队的集结制造困难，并且侵入和进攻寮国战斗部队的集结区，在其他十个省内对过去曾经参加抗战的人采取镇压和报复行为。老挝王国政府的这些行为是违反日内瓦协议的。
    富米说，寮国战斗部队严格地遵守了停战协定。寮国战斗部队竭力避免发生任何冲突；同时，清楚地表明了它的意愿，即同王国政府真诚合作，来举行政治会议，通过自由普选实现老挝的统一。由于寮国战斗部队的努力，协商已经开始了。
    富米指出，但是，谈判从一开始就碰到了困难，王国政府代表团拒绝在王国政府首相和苏发努冯亲王原先同意的地点——康开举行会议。由于寮国战斗部队代表团的和解精神，政治会议在查尔平原开始举行了。但是在会议召开后，王国政府代表团又给会议的进行制造困难，甚至离开会议，使协商中断。王国政府的别动队并且进攻战斗部队集结区，造成紧张局势。
    富米表示希望王国政府停止挑衅行动，特别是停止向桑怒和丰沙里两省的寮国战斗部队进行军事进攻，以为政治会议造成良好条件。
    富米指出，通盘解决政治问题的基本点是成立一个政治协商委员会，给予它必要的权利，并且付托它必要的任务，特别是准备在全国举行自由普选以实现国家统一的任务。
    富米最后说，为了巩固和平、实现民主统一和完全独立，寮国战斗部队代表团希望双方加强相互间的了解，希望双方本着诚恳合作的精神，进行协商，以执行日内瓦协定，使政治会议迅速达到良好结果。
    据消息说，二月三日，老挝王国政府政治代表团到查尔平原和寮国战斗部队政治代表团举行了一次会议。但是，老挝王国政府代表团还没有改变态度，会议因此没有获得结果。
