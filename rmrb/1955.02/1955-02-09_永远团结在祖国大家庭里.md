Forever United in the Motherland's Big Family
Dao Youliang, Vice Chairman of the People's Government of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region, Yunnan Province

January 23rd is a day most unforgettable for the people of all ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region, Yunnan Province. Two years ago, under the brilliant light of the Communist Party's great policy on nationalities, the people of all ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna celebrated the establishment of the autonomous region on this beautiful and fertile land on the southwestern border of the motherland. Like all fraternal ethnic groups throughout the country, the people of all ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna suffered from the Kuomintang bandit gang's cruel oppression for a long time before liberation. At that time, we were denied political equality, our economy was backward, our culture declined, and our population dwindled sharply, almost to the point of extinction.

In the spring of 1950, the five-star red flag was planted on the southwestern border, and the powerful People's Liberation Army wiped out the Kuomintang remnants entrenched in Xishuangbanna. Since then, we have been forever freed from the dark rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, all ethnic groups, together with the People's Liberation Army, eliminated bandits within the territory, mediated various ethnic disputes left over from history, strengthened the unity of all ethnic groups, stabilized social order, and consolidated national defense. On this basis, in accordance with the "Outline for the Implementation of National Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China," we held the first session of the First People's Representative Conference of All Ethnic Groups and All Circles in Xishuangbanna, an unprecedented unity conference in the history of Xishuangbanna, in January 1953, and elected the Committee of the People's Government of the Autonomous Region, and established the People's Government of the Autonomous Region. Since then, we have transformed from a position of being enslaved and oppressed to become the masters of our own region.

After the establishment of the autonomous region, we gradually realized the nationalization of the autonomous organs. Up to now, a total of 597 cadres of various ethnic groups at all levels have been trained locally. In government organs, local ethnic cadres have accounted for 55.6% of the total number of cadres, and local ethnic cadres have assumed the main responsible positions in many departments. We adopted the Dai language as a tool for exercising the right to autonomy. All major issues concerning the autonomous region are discussed and decided by the People's Representatives Conference of All Ethnic Groups and All Circles and the Government Committee. In the past two years, we have convened a total of fourteen meetings including the People's Representatives Conference of All Ethnic Groups and All Circles, the Consultative Committee, the Government Committee, and the Joint Conference of Presidents of Various Banna Governments, as well as dozens of other specialized meetings. These meetings have fully promoted democracy, exercised the right of the people of all ethnic groups to be masters of their own affairs, and embodied the principles of democratic centralism and collective leadership. This has greatly stimulated the enthusiasm and initiative of ethnic cadres, enhanced the internationalism and patriotism of the people of all ethnic groups, strengthened the unity between and within ethnic groups, and promoted various construction works in the autonomous region. This is one of our more satisfactory experiences in implementing the Communist Party's policy on national regional autonomy in the past two years.

After the establishment of the autonomous region, the unity between and within various ethnic groups in the territory has been further strengthened. Before liberation, due to the oppression and instigation of Han chauvinist rulers, as well as certain backward factors existing in our own ethnic groups, mutual discrimination and distrust between ethnic groups were created, hindering the progress and development of all ethnic groups. Now this situation has changed. In the past, when children in rural areas cried, parents would use the phrase "the Han people are coming" to scare them, but now everywhere you can see boys and girls of all ethnic groups holding the hands of Han cadres or soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, asking them to teach them songs, teach them to dance, and tell stories. All ethnic groups affectionately call the Han people "Big Brother," and are unspeakably grateful for the friendly help of the Han people and Han cadres. At the same time, we also pay special attention to the unity of the Dai people and the fraternal ethnic groups in the territory. In addition to the Dai people, cadres from other fraternal ethnic groups also participate in the work of the autonomous organs. Shortly after the establishment of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region, the Gelanghe Aini Autonomous Region and the Yiwu Yao Autonomous Region were established. At present, we are actively preparing for the autonomous areas or ethnic townships of other ethnic groups. In this way, the people of all ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna will be further united closely.

The People's Government of the Autonomous Region attaches great importance to leading the people of all ethnic groups in developing production and improving the lives of the people of all ethnic groups. In 1954, the entire autonomous region mobilized more than 77,000 farmers of all ethnic groups to build and repair 930 irrigation ditches and 56 dams, and issued more than 2 billion yuan in various agricultural loans, including 571 head of cattle. At the same time, the People's Government supplied the people of all ethnic groups with various agricultural tools and hunting tools. As a result of the government's vigorous support, the rice transplanting time last year was advanced by 20 days to a month compared with previous years. The government also organized the people of all ethnic groups in the mountainous areas to actively hunt and protect crops. According to incomplete statistics, 15 tigers, 16 leopards, and 81 bears were hunted last year, as well as many other wild animals such as wild cattle, wild boars, deer, and monkeys.

Agricultural production and farming techniques have been greatly improved compared with the past. According to statistics from eight bannas, more than 4 million catties of fertilizer were applied last year, and many places implemented multiple plowing and harrowing, weeding and hoeing. Due to the improvement of farming techniques, the various agricultural products of the autonomous region have increased year by year. In 1954, the total rice production in the region increased by nearly 10% compared with 1953, and some villages even increased production by as much as 50%. The output of the nationally famous Pu'er tea increased by 4.64 times last year compared with 1950, and cotton also increased by about 10% compared with 1953.

Last year, the Lancang River experienced the biggest flood in more than a decade, and the Jinghong and Mengla basins suffered from floods. Thanks to the special concern of the higher-level Party committees and the People's Government, cadres were promptly organized to visit and provide relief to the disaster areas, strengthening the will of the people of all ethnic groups to fight against natural disasters. Now the farmers in the disaster areas have planted spring crops and early rice.

The opening of the Kunlu Highway (Kunming to Daluo) to Yunjinghong, the capital of the autonomous region, has shortened the distance between us and Beijing and other regions of the motherland, bringing infinite light and happiness to the people of all ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna, and greatly enhancing the patriotic consciousness of the people of all ethnic groups. In the past, under reactionary rule, although we were apportioned "road construction fees" every year for more than 40 years, the people never traveled on good roads, and never even saw the shadow of a car. But only four years after liberation, the highway was built to Xishuangbanna. In the past, it took a month to travel from Yunjinghong to Kunming, but now it only takes three to five days by car.

After the highway opened, state-owned industry and commerce developed rapidly. Now there are one state-owned China Tea Company, tea factory, tea experiment station, and forestry experiment station each, and the comprehensive local state-owned Jingde Factory is also expanding day by day. In terms of commerce, state-owned trading organizations increased by 13.5 times last year compared with 1950. Due to the development of state-owned industry and commerce, the exchange parity between various agricultural and sideline products and industrial products in the autonomous region is also becoming more reasonable. For example, before liberation, 2,400 catties of seed cotton could be exchanged for one sewing machine, but now it only takes 947.5 catties; before liberation, four catties of rice could be exchanged for a box of matches, but now three catties of rice can be exchanged for ten boxes; in the past, 900 catties of glutinous rice could be exchanged for one cotton blanket, but now 882 catties of glutinous rice can be exchanged for nine cotton blankets; before liberation, it was difficult to exchange one catty of tea for one catty of salt, but now one catty of tea can be exchanged for two catties of salt.

The cultural, educational, and health work in our region has also made significant progress. At the beginning of liberation, almost all schools in the region were closed. Now there is one junior normal school and 41 primary schools in the region. The number of students is currently more than five times that of 1950. At the beginning of liberation, there was only one hospital and five or six health workers in the region. By the end of 1954, there were four hospitals, three health clinics, two health stations, and one epidemic prevention station. The number of health workers increased by 21 times compared with 1951. Now the ethnic hospital is under construction and is expected to be completed by the end of this year.

Since liberation, especially after the establishment of the autonomous region, the population and livestock in our region have gradually increased. For example, Manbajiao in Banna Jinghong is a village of more than 30 households. Before liberation, from 1947 to 1949, 30 people died and 10 were born in the entire village. Since liberation, the population has increased by a net of 27 people in four years. Before liberation, Xinfuzhang was a very poor Lahu village. In 1953, the village had a population of 203 people, and in 1954 the net increase was 10 people. Before liberation, most families in this village lacked food for more than half a year each year, but now they are almost all able to eat enough. The increase in livestock is also very significant. For example, Manzhanzai village had only 34 water buffaloes, 39 yellow cattle, and 5 horses before liberation. Last year, the number of water buffaloes increased to 62, the number of yellow cattle increased to 67, and the number of horses increased to 35. Due to the improvement of people's lives, purchasing power has also greatly increased. From January to October 1954, the Yunjinghong department store sold 11,140 bolts of various fabrics, 28,360 pairs of rubber shoes, and 360 sewing machines. Many poor farmers who had no shoes to wear in the past are now wearing Warrior sneakers.

The Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region is located on the border of the motherland. Our people of all ethnic groups, together with the People's Liberation Army, are undertaking the glorious task of defending the peaceful construction of the motherland. In order to defend the security of our motherland and protect our own increasingly better and happier lives, we will further unite in the big family of the motherland, unite around the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, strengthen the struggle against the enemy, further do a good job in anti-banditry and anti-espionage work, support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan, and contribute our strength to the socialist construction of the motherland.

    永远团结在祖国大家庭里
    云南省西双版纳傣族自治区人民政府副主席　刀有良
    一月二十三日这一天，是云南省西双版纳傣族和其他各兄弟民族人民最难忘的日子。两年前，我们西双版纳各族人民在共产党的伟大民族政策光辉照耀下，在祖国西南边疆这块美丽富饶的土地上庆祝自治区的成立。西双版纳各族人民和全国各兄弟民族一样，解放前长时期遭受着国民党匪帮的残酷压榨。那时，我们政治上得不到平等，经济落后，文化衰落，人口锐减，几乎频于亡族灭种的境地。
    一九五○年春天，五星红旗插到了西南边疆，强大的人民解放军把盘踞在西双版纳的国民党残匪消灭了，从此我们永远摆脱了国民党匪帮的黑暗统治。各族人民在共产党和人民政府的领导下，和人民解放军一起肃清了境内土匪，调解了历史上遗留下来的各种民族纠纷，加强了各民族的团结，安定了社会秩序，巩固了国防。在这种基础上，我们根据“中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要”，在一九五三年一月举行了西双版纳历史上从来没有过的各民族团结大会——第一届各族各界人民代表会议第一次会议，选举了自治区人民政府委员会，成立了自治区人民政府。从那时候起，我们开始从被奴役、被压迫的地位，变成了自己地区的主人。
    自治区成立后，我们逐步地实现了自治机关的民族化。到目前为止，共培养了本地各民族各级干部五百九十七人；在政府机关中，本地民族干部已占干部总数的百分之五十五点六，许多部门的主要负责职务都是本地各民族干部担任。我们采用了傣文作为行使自治权利的工具。凡有关本自治区的重大问题都由各族各界人民代表会议和政府委员会讨论决定。两年来，我们召开了各族各界人民代表会议、协商委员会、政府委员会、各版纳政府主席联席会议等共十四次，其它专门会议数十次。这些会议，充分发扬了民主，运用了各族人民当家作主的权利，体现了民主集中制和集体领导的原则。这就大大发挥了民族干部的积极主动精神，提高了各族人民的国际主义和爱国主义思想，增强了各民族之间和民族内部的团结，推动了自治区的各项建设工作。这是我们两年来执行共产党的民族区域自治政策比较满意的经验之一。
    自治区成立以后，进一步加强了境内各民族之间和民族内部的团结。解放前，由于大汉族主义统治者的压迫挑拨，以及本民族存在的某些落后因素，造成了各民族间的相互歧视和不信任，阻碍了各民族的进步发展。现在这种情况改变了。过去农村里小孩子哭了，父母就用“汉人来了”这句话来威吓小孩，现在却是到处都能看到各民族的男女儿童拉着汉族干部或是人民解放军战士的手，要求他们教唱歌、教跳舞、讲故事。各族人民都亲切地称汉族为“老大哥”，对于汉族人民和汉族干部的友爱帮助，都有说不出的感激。同时我们也特别注意到傣族和境内各兄弟民族的团结。自治机关内除傣族外，也有其他各兄弟民族的干部参加工作。西双版纳傣族自治区成立不久，就成立了格朗和爱尼族自治区、易武瑶族自治区，目前正积极筹备其他民族的自治地方或民族乡。这样，西双版纳各族人民必将更进一步亲密地团结起来。
    自治区人民政府特别重视领导各族人民发展生产，改善各族人民生活。一九五四年全自治区发动了各族农民七万七千多人，兴修和整修了水沟九百三十条、水坝五十六座，发放了各种农业贷款二十多亿元，其中耕牛就贷放了五百七十一头。人民政府同时供应了各族人民各种农具和打猎用的工具。政府大力扶助的结果，去年栽秧时间比往年提前二十天到一个月。政府并组织山区各族人民积极打猎，保护庄稼。据不完全统计，去年猎获的老虎有十五只，豹子十六只，熊八十一只，另外还有野牛、野猪、鹿、猴子等许多野兽。
    农业生产耕作技术比过去有了许多改进。据八个版纳的统计，去年施肥四百多万斤，有很多地方实行了多犁多耙，除草薅秧。由于耕作技术的改进，自治区各种农产品一年比一年增加。一九五四年全区的稻谷比一九五三年增产将近一成，有的村寨甚至增产五成之多。全国著名的普洱茶的产量，去年比一九五○年增产了四点六四倍，棉花也比一九五三年增产一成左右。
    去年澜沧江发生了十多年来未有的大洪水，景洪、勐罕两个坝子遭受了水灾。由于上级党委和人民政府的特别关怀，及时组织干部到灾区进行了慰问和救济，增强了各族人民和自然灾害作斗争的意志。现在灾区农民都栽上了小春和早稻。
    昆洛公路（昆明到打洛）通车到自治区首府的允景洪以后，缩短了我们和北京以及祖国其他地区的距离，给西双版纳各族人民带来了无限的光明幸福，大大提高了各族人民的爱国主义觉悟。过去在反动统治下面，四十多年来，我们虽然年年被摊派
  “筑路费”，但是人民从来没有走过好路，连汽车的影子都没有看到。但解放仅仅四年多，公路就修到了西双版纳。过去由允景洪到昆明要走一个月的时间，现在乘汽车只需要三五天就可以到了。
    公路通车后，国营工商业有了飞跃的发展。现在有国营中国茶业公司、制茶厂、茶叶试验场、林业试验场各一个，综合性的地方国营景德工厂也一天天在扩大。商业方面，国营贸易机构去年比一九五○年增加了十三倍半。由于国营工商业的发展，自治区的各种农副业产品和工业品的交换比价也日趋合理。例如解放前要二千四百斤籽棉才能换到一部缝衣机，现在只需要九百四十七斤半；解放前四斤大米换一盒火柴，现在三斤大米可换到十盒；过去九百斤糯米换一床棉毯，现在八百八十二斤糯米能换到棉毯九床；解放前一斤茶叶换一斤食盐都难换到，现在一斤茶叶可以换到两斤食盐了。
    我区的文教卫生工作也获得显著的进展。初解放时，全区学校几乎全部停办，现在全区有一所初级师范学校，四十一所小学校。学生人数目前比一九五○年增加了五倍多。初解放时，全区只有一个卫生院，五、六个卫生工作人员，到一九五四年底，已有四个卫生院、三个卫生所、两个保健站和一个防疫站，卫生工作人员比一九五一年增加了二十一倍。现在民族医院正在建筑中，预计今年年底可以完工。
    解放以后，特别是自治区成立以后，我区人口、牲畜也逐渐增加。如版纳景洪的曼八角，是三十多户的一个寨子，解放前一九四七年到一九四九年，全寨死三十人，生十人；解放以来，在四年中人口净增了二十七人。解放前，新富掌是一个很穷苦的拉祜族寨子，一九五三年全村人口有二百零三人，一九五四年净增了十人。这个寨子解放前大多数人家每年都缺半年以上的粮，现在差不多都够吃了。牲畜的增加也是很显著的。如曼占宰一个寨子，解放前只有三十四头水牛，三十九头黄牛和五匹马，去年水牛增加到六十二头，黄牛增加到六十七头，马增加到三十五匹。由于人民生活的改善，购买力也大大提高了。一九五四年一至十月，在允景洪的百货公司出售了各种布匹达一万一千一百四十匹，胶鞋二万八千三百六十双，缝衣机三百六十部。很多过去没有鞋子穿的贫苦农民，现在也穿上回力球鞋了。
    西双版纳傣族自治区地处祖国边疆，我们各族人民正和人民解放军一道担负着保卫祖国和平建设的光荣任务。为了保卫我们祖国的安全，保卫我们自己的日益美好幸福的生活，我们今后将进一步地团结在祖国大家庭里，团结在共产党和毛主席的周围，加强对敌斗争，进一步作好防匪肃特工作，支援人民解放军解放台湾，并为祖国社会主义建设贡献自己的力量。
