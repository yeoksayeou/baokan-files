    Surveyed 100,000 Mu of Wasteland in Poyang County
    The wasteland surveying team of Shangrao Special District, Jiangxi Province, began surveying work on the wasteland of Lujia Zhou, Yaque Lake, and Siwan Lake in Poyang County at the end of last December. After more than 20 days of intense work, it has recently successfully completed the surveying task of more than 100,000 mu of wasteland. According to the surveying results, apart from lakes and low-lying areas, it is estimated that there are at least more than 50,000 mu of arable land. These barren lands have fertile soil, flat terrain, and favorable conditions such as a warm local climate and a long frost-free period. As long as embankments are built for flood control, various crops can be planted. At the same time, it is also very convenient to carry out mechanical operations here, and it can be used as a good base for building state-owned mechanized farms in the future.

    踏测了鄱阳县的十万亩荒地
    江西省上饶专区荒地踏测工作队于去年十二月底先后在鄱阳县的芦家洲、雅鹊湖与四万湖等荒地上开始踏测工作。经过二十多天的紧张劳动，最近已胜利完成了十万余亩荒地面积的踏测任务。踏测结果，其中除了湖泊与低洼地以外，估计可耕地至少有五万多亩。这些荒芜的土地，土壤肥沃，地势平坦，加以当地气候和暖，无霜期长等有利条件，只要筑堤防洪，就可以种植各种农作物。同时，在这里进行机械操作也很方便，将来发展国营机械农场就可以做为良好的建场基地。
