Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: People from all walks of life in major cities such as Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an warmly support the government's measure to issue new Renminbi.

    Shanghai citizens read the State Council's order on the issuance of new Renminbi and the recall of the existing Renminbi with joy. In workshops, on the streets, in shops, and on public transportation, people everywhere were discussing this good news. People said that the stable prices in recent years were the result of the stable prices. Accountants, cashiers, salespersons of various companies and enterprises, and conductors on public transport all believed that the new currency was convenient for calculation and use. Rong Yiren, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, said: The issuance of the new Renminbi will further improve and consolidate the monetary system, which will definitely be more conducive to industrial production.

    More than 8,000 people from industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin held meetings on the 21st, respectively, and adopted four guarantees from the industrial and commercial circles of Tianjin in support of the government's issuance of new currency. The four guarantees are: 1. Implement the spirit of patriotism and law-abiding, resolutely support and implement the government's various regulations on the issuance of new Renminbi with practical actions, and oppose all speculation, rumor-mongering, and other destructive behaviors; 2. Strictly abide by the legal exchange rate, and oppose refusing to use old currency, offering discounts, surcharges, and reducing weight or delaying delivery during the exchange period; 3. Ensure clear pricing, and oppose the bad behavior of taking the opportunity to raise prices and deceive the masses; 4. Oppose illegal acts such as hoarding, speculation, inferior quality, and adulteration, and meet the new Renminbi with improved operation and management.

    On the morning of the 21st, when the newspapers carrying the State Council's order on the issuance of new Renminbi and the recall of existing Renminbi were delivered to various factories in Shenyang, the workers in each factory discussed it happily. After hearing the good news, the workers in the steelmaking workshop of Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory said: The state is doing the right thing, and we have long hoped for the issuance of a new currency. Chen Yongren, leader of the open hearth furnace Ding shift, told reporters: The issuance of new Renminbi will not cause us any loss, because prices are stable and people's lives are also stable. Yang Benfan, a staff member of the accounting department of this factory, said: Now we often deal with hundreds of millions or tens of billions when keeping accounts, which is very difficult to calculate. The calculation of the new currency will greatly reduce mental work.

    Wuhan citizens warmly welcome the news of the issuance of new Renminbi. In the streets and alleys, at the stations and docks, more than 100 bulletin boards were surrounded by dense crowds of readers all day on the 21st. Zhang Hanyun, a housewife in Jiaoyi Street, pointed to the sample of the new currency printed in the newspaper and said to reporters: The new Renminbi is easy to recognize and easy to calculate. Although I am illiterate, I am not afraid of using the wrong money in the future. Representatives of state-owned and private enterprises from Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Liaoning, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi and other places who came to Wuhan to participate in the upcoming Hubei Provincial Material Exchange Conference held a discussion in the afternoon and unanimously supported the measure of issuing new currency. Many salespersons, accountants, and cashiers of state-owned and private shops excitedly talked about the benefits of the new currency.

    The people of Guangzhou spread and discussed the good news of the issuance of the new Renminbi. Many agencies and organizations held report meetings and discussion meetings. Thousands of water residents in the Zhujiang District rowed their small boats to the Guangming Grand Theater on the Zhujiang River in the Henan District to participate in the conference to welcome the issuance of new currency. Xing Yiyi, a returned overseas Chinese from Malaysia who left the motherland for more than 20 years, said: "In the past, the Kuomintang's fake currency killed people. The money sent home from Malaysia for a picul of rice could only buy more than ten catties of rice. The Renminbi was already very stable, and now the denomination has been reduced. The government is really thinking about the convenience of the people everywhere." The industrial and commercial circles of Guangzhou held a conference today to support the issuance of the new Renminbi and the recall of the existing Renminbi. The conference unanimously adopted a resolution to ensure that the city's industrial and commercial circles abide by national laws and regulations. From March 1, all commodities will be priced in new currency at the legal new and old currency conversion rate, without raising or rounding down, without speculation or raising prices; the resolution also guarantees that during the period when the new and old currencies are in circulation at the same time, the old currency will not be rejected.

    Chongqing People's Broadcasting Station broadcast the news of the state's issuance of new Renminbi to the people of the city at 7 o'clock on the morning of the 21st. The citizens felt particularly excited. Huang Rongchang, a representative of the National People's Congress and a special labor model in Chongqing, said: "The State Council really thinks about us carefully. The large denomination has been changed to a smaller one, which is more convenient to use now." Hu Zi'ang, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said that the issuance of new currency this time is based on the stable financial and price situation in recent years, and is issued according to the needs of national economic construction and the wishes of the people. Our industrial and commercial circles wholeheartedly support this wise measure of the government.

    When the news of the imminent issuance of the new Renminbi reached the Xi'an Municipal Agricultural Production Competition and Labor Model Conference on the 21st, a round of applause broke out in the venue. Feng Tingxuan, a labor model attending the meeting and deputy director of the Tianjiawan First Vegetable Production Cooperative, said: "Our new Renminbi is issued in the context of stable prices, unlike the kind of unguaranteed notes issued by the Kuomintang reactionaries." The Xi'an Federation of Industry and Commerce held an enlarged meeting that day, and proposed four guarantees to ensure that goods are sold at state-owned commercial prices and to prevent hoarding and speculation, in support of the issuance of the new Renminbi. The Xi'an Municipal People's Committee convened a temporary meeting to discuss various issues related to the implementation of the State Council's order on the issuance of new Renminbi and the recall of existing Renminbi.
