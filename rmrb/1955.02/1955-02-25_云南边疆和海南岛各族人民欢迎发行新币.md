The prominent figures of various autonomous regions in the border areas of Yunnan Province welcomed the issuance of the new Renminbi. Zhao Cunxin, Chairman of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Region People's Government, and Deputy Chairman Dao Chengzong (Dai nationality), both believe that the issuance of the new Renminbi in the border areas of the motherland, as well as in the interior, is beneficial to the construction of the motherland and the economic development of all ethnic groups, and fully meets the requirements of all ethnic groups. Pai Qiren (Jingpo nationality), Vice Chairman of the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Region People's Government, said: "During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, many people were exploited and impoverished because of the constant exchange of 'Legal Tender,' 'Gold Yuan Certificates,' and 'Yunnan banknotes.' The issuance of new currency by our government now is fundamentally different from that time." Li Chengxiang, Chairman of the Honghe Hani Autonomous Region People's Government, said: "In the past, people of all ethnic groups in the Honghe area never believed in or used paper money, but after liberation, the Renminbi has enjoyed a high reputation in the Honghe area. The new Renminbi is easy to identify and adapts to the living habits of all ethnic groups in Honghe." He Pinfu (Lisu nationality), a member of the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Region People's Government, believes that the face value of the new Renminbi is very suitable for the long-standing habits of the Lisu people. Prominent figures from various autonomous regions were excited about the four ethnic scripts printed on the new Renminbi, believing that this is unprecedented in the history of our country, and it embodies the equality and unity of all ethnic groups in our country.

The people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life on Hainan Island were very happy and expressed their support after hearing the news of the state's issuance of new Renminbi. Wang Guoxing, Chairman of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Region People's Government, told reporters: "All the Li people on Hainan Island wholeheartedly support this wise measure of the government. The vast majority of the Li people are illiterate, and the color and size of the new currency can help them recognize the denomination. In particular, the Li people have always habitually called 10,000 yuan and 1,000 yuan Renminbi as one yuan and one jiao, and the issuance of the new currency this time is consistent with the habits of the Li people." Li and Miao cadres studying in Haikou are very excited about the Han characters and three ethnic minority scripts and the "Great Unity of All Nationalities" picture printed on the back of the new Renminbi. Zhou Zheng, a representative of the National People's Congress and an overseas Chinese returning from Thailand, said that the exchange of remittances from overseas Chinese will not be affected in the slightest after the issuance of the new currency. The reduction in the face value of the currency gives many conveniences to returned overseas Chinese and their families. This important economic measure will undoubtedly be supported by millions of overseas Chinese. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    云南边疆和海南岛各族人民欢迎发行新币
    云南省边疆各自治区的著名人士欢迎发行新人民币。西双版纳傣族自治区人民政府主席召存信和副主席刀承宗（傣族），都认为今天在祖国边疆和内地一样发行新的人民币，这对祖国建设和发展各族人民的经济都是有利的，完全符合各族人民的要求。德宏傣族景颇族自治区人民政府副主席排启仁（景颇族）说：“在国民党反动统治时代，很多人因为‘法币’‘金圆券’‘滇票’等换来换去，被剥削穷了。现在我们的政府发行新币和那时的情况根本不同了。”红河哈尼族自治区人民政府主席李呈祥说：“红河区各族人民过去从来不相信也不使用纸币，解放后人民币却在红河区享有很高的威信。新的人民币容易识别，并和红河各族人民的生活习惯相适应。”怒江傈僳族自治区人民政府委员和品福（傈僳族）认为新的人民币票面额很适合傈僳族人民历来的习惯。各自治区的著名人士对新的人民币上印有四种民族文字，都感到兴奋，认为这是我国历史上从来没有过的事，它体现了我们国家各民族的平等和团结。
    海南岛各族各界人民听到国家发行新人民币的消息后，都非常欢欣表示拥护。海南黎族苗族自治区人民政府主席王国兴对记者说：“我们海南岛全体黎族人民都衷心地拥护政府这个英明的措施。黎族人民绝大多数都不认识字，新币的颜色和大小能帮助他们认识币值。特别是黎族人民对一万元、一千元的人民币，一直都习惯地叫做一元、一角，这次发行新币，就和黎族人民的习惯一致了。”正在海口学习的黎族、苗族干部，对于新的人民币背面印有汉字和三种少数民族的文字和“各民族大团结”的图景，感到十分兴奋。全国人民代表大会代表、泰国归国华侨周铮说，新币发行后对侨汇的兑换丝毫不受影响。货币的票面额缩小给予归国华侨和侨眷很多的便利。这个重要的经济措施无疑地将会得到海外千百万华侨的拥护。　（据新华社讯）
