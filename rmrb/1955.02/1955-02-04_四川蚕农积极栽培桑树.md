Sichuan Province's silkworm-producing areas are actively carrying out mulberry tree cultivation work. Nanchong, Suining, Mianyang, and other special districts have all made arrangements, requiring silkworm farmers to make extensive use of sloping land, field ridges, cemetery plots, and other vacant areas to plant mulberry trees. Mianyang County also requires each agricultural production cooperative in mountainous areas to allocate three mu of land to cultivate mulberry seedlings. Local supply and marketing cooperatives have also prepared a large number of production materials such as mulberry shears, mulberry saws, thermometers, and medicines to supply the needs of silkworm farmers. Currently, more than 1,300 technical cadres across the province have gone to key areas to guide silkworm farmers in carrying out mulberry planting and protection work, and more than 10,000 silkworm farmer technicians have also been trained. Now, these technicians have returned to their respective areas to carry out their work.

    四川蚕农积极栽培桑树
    四川省蚕桑地区积极开展桑树栽培工作。南充、遂宁、绵阳等专区都已作了布置，要求蚕农利用坡地、田坎、坟园等隙地大量栽植桑树。绵阳县还要求山区的每个农业生产合作社拨出三亩地来培育桑苗。各地供销合作社也准备了大批桑剪、桑锯、温度表、药品等生产资料来供应蚕农的需要。目前，全省已有一千三百多名技术干部分赴各重点区，指导蚕农开展栽桑护桑工作，并且还训练了一万多名蚕农技术手。现在，这些技术手都已返回各地进行工作。
