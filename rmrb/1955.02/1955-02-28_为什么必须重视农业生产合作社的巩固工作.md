    At present, the number of agricultural production cooperatives nationwide has exceeded 500,000, nearing the completion of the original development plan. The primary task now is not to develop quantity, but to focus on improving quality; that is, to shift comprehensively to consolidation work.
    A harmful ideological tendency that must be overcome is the tendency to value development and belittle consolidation.
    Why is it necessary to emphasize the consolidation of cooperatives? Among the newly developed cooperatives this time, due to various working conditions and historical conditions, some are consolidated, some are not, and a small number are very unconsolidated. If we do not promptly help these unconsolidated cooperatives carry out rectification work, some cooperatives may experience internal disunity, production chaos, and other unhealthy phenomena, and even face the danger of regression and disintegration. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out a period of consolidation work. This is easy to understand. But these are not enough to illustrate the full significance of emphasizing consolidation work. It must be further understood that the task of the agricultural collectivization movement is to change the existing small-scale private ownership of production relations in agriculture and establish new socialist production relations. It lays the foundation for socialist construction throughout the countryside and is a century-long undertaking to fundamentally eliminate the old and establish the new. How well the collectivization movement is carried out will determine the development of rural work in the coming historical period. That is why the Party Central Committee has repeatedly instructed all Party committees leading rural work to shift the focus of rural work to the mutual aid and cooperation movement.
    The collectivization movement will lay the foundation for future rural work, and the existing cooperatives will lay the foundation for the entire collectivization movement in the future. The foundation must be laid well. Because, to get the peasants to accept new socialist ideas and abandon old private ownership ideas, we must not only never rely on coercive means, but also not rely solely on general political mobilization work. We should mainly rely on the obvious facts that the cooperative economy is superior to individual management to attract them, which is what the Central Committee has instructed to do by relying on demonstration examples. The movement last winter and this spring has seen great development, and there are many reasons for this, among which the most effective is that the vast majority of the 100,000 cooperatives already established in the previous year have developed production and increased income. If the 100,000 cooperatives in the previous year had not been run well, the achievements of the movement last winter and this spring would have been unimaginable. This experience reflects a fundamental truth: the actions of any social class or stratum in a revolution are ultimately determined by the impact of a certain social system on their economic interests.
    When some of our comrades estimate the current trends of peasants, they like to use the phrase "general trend" to explain the psychology of peasants actively joining cooperatives. The question is not whether the situation of "general trend" exists, but how to understand the full meaning included in "general trend." If "general trend" refers to the fact that we have done a good job, the cooperatives have exerted economic superiority, coupled with various other socialist measures, the socialist advantage has been gradually established in the countryside, the Party's political influence on peasants has been further deepened and strengthened, and peasants voluntarily participating in cooperatives has formed a mass action, this is naturally understandable. If "general trend" is understood as peasants flocking to join cooperatives simply because there is a socialist atmosphere in the countryside before they have determined their economic interests, this is naturally difficult to understand. It must be understood that different understandings will produce different working methods and different working results, and errors in understanding will inevitably evolve into errors in work.
    Now, nearly 15 percent of peasant households nationwide have joined cooperatives. Of course, more peasant households will join in the next few years. How should we persuade them? According to the former correct understanding, we should follow the persuasion and demonstration methods indicated by the Party's work line, run batches of developed cooperatives well, educate peasants through the work achievements of these cooperatives, let them experience the socialist truth from their own experience, overcome the conservative mentality they have accepted under the private ownership system, and cultivate a large number of backbones through these cooperatives, cultivate the experience of the masses in managing collective operations, and make the masses believe that cooperatives are not only beneficial to themselves, but also can be run well as long as they are established, and are indeed advanced production organizations worthy of the name. In this way, participating in cooperatives will become a universal voluntary demand among the masses, forming a mass collectivization movement in which the Party and the government help and support from top to bottom, and the peasant masses respond from bottom to top, and the two combine and promote each other. According to the latter incorrect understanding, in the cooperative movement, only development is paid attention to, but not consolidation, the arduous work of running cooperatives is relaxed, development is sought on an unconsolidated basis year after year, and the method of a periodic rush is used year after year, and the method of using an unrealistic "high tide atmosphere" to stir up the masses to join cooperatives is used to develop cooperatives, seeking quantity without seeking quality, emphasizing quantity without emphasizing quality, forming an error of being divorced from the masses and unfavorable to production.
    According to the experience of the past year, it can be fully affirmed that the former approach is the most effective and conducive to the rapid development of the movement; the latter approach has very low effectiveness and will put the movement in a dilemma. Therefore, it can be concluded that if we want to carry out the future collectivization movement rapidly and healthily, we should not only pay attention to the planned development of new cooperatives, and it is wrong not to pay attention to development; but we must seek development on a reliable basis, specifically, we should consolidate each newly developed cooperative in a timely manner and prepare for the next step of development.
    It is worth noting that many comrades have a fragmented view of the collectivization task, limiting the collectivization movement to just completing the task of the percentage of organized farmers, and shirking the economic work after the cooperatives are built, and putting it into the spontaneous process of affairs to solve. This idea reflects a lack of clear understanding of the content and nature of the work of developing cooperatives. Developing cooperatives is a socialist economic reform work, although it is also an economic reform, but it is different from the economic reform in the land reform. The land reform was to change the feudal ownership system into a peasant ownership system. At that time, after the political struggle of the masses, the landlord's monopoly on land was broken, and the land was confiscated and distributed, and the reform task was considered complete. As for the economic work after the distribution of land, it can be expected that the peasants will be responsible for managing it themselves. Because the individual management method was originally a form that had already appeared under the feudal system and was familiar and accustomed to by the peasants. There will be no major organizational difficulties for peasants to carry out operations after obtaining land. Different from this situation, the current collectivization movement is a collective production in which peasants voluntarily unite their land and other major means of production. The establishment of a cooperative and the initial formation of a union can only be said to be the starting point of the work, not its end.
    It is very clear that if the work of establishing cooperatives is limited to completing the preliminary organizational procedures of collecting members and electing their own management organs, and the economic work of the cooperatives is allowed to proceed spontaneously, then it would be a big mistake. Since the Party has assumed the task of organizing the socialist economy in agriculture, it must pay attention to the situation of the cooperatives consistently from beginning to end, and understand all the details of the entire development process of the cooperatives, from collecting members to establish management organizations, to organizing labor production to implement distribution, consolidating the socialist unity among members, etc., and be responsible for giving specific help, so that its economic position is increasingly consolidated, so as to continuously improve technology, develop production, increase the material and cultural welfare of members, and continuously develop and improve.
    The idea of emphasizing development and belittling consolidation is essentially spontaneity in the task of socialist construction and must be resolutely overcome.
    The consolidation work of existing cooperatives must be carried out systematically and continuously. We will talk about the detailed content of these works later. As for the most important tasks at present: First, all cooperatives must be organized to shift the focus of work to the preparation work for organizing spring plowing and sowing, such as tidying up the land, extracting accumulated seeds and fertilizers, maintaining draft animals, etc., so as to lay a foundation for the production of the whole year. In order to carry out production, practical measures must be formulated in terms of organizing collective labor to promote the contract system and in terms of collecting production funds for this year. It is also necessary to take the cooperative as the center, rely on this central force to drive the spring plowing production movement in the entire countryside. Second, while organizing economic work, attention should also be paid to consolidating the organization of the cooperative politically. In addition to seizing the opportunity to resolve important disputes among members to consolidate the unity of the entire cooperative, in many cooperatives, there is a small part of unstable elements, that is, a small number of so-called nominal members. They often ask to withdraw from the cooperative on the pretext that there are individual minor shortcomings in the cooperative after it is established. The problems of these members should also be seriously resolved. We must not ignore or treat them rigidly because the attitude of these members is incorrect. We must neither passively push them out of the cooperative, nor forcibly retain them in the cooperative against their will, but should first make an effort to win them over ideologically, patiently persuade them, make them recognize the advantages and disadvantages, distinguish between right and wrong, and strengthen their confidence in truly joining the cooperative. After this ideological education work. If they prefer to work individually for a period of time and see again, they should naturally be allowed to withdraw from the cooperative, and they should continue to be warmly helped after they withdraw from the cooperative. In addition to solving the problems of this small number of wavering members, there is a more important organizational task, that is, how to organizationally ensure the purity of the cooperative. Under the conditions of the rapid development of the movement in large quantities, it is inevitable that a group of class enemies will infiltrate the cooperative and use this revolutionary form to destroy the revolution. Because although the cooperative is a form of socialist economic type, it still has the danger of being used by hostile class elements and various counter-revolutionary elements under certain conditions for their own purposes to carry out activities. Therefore, for some false cooperatives that have been clearly identified as being controlled by counter-revolutionary elements, landlords and rich peasants, it is necessary to persuade the masses to rely on the masses, dissolve it, reorganize it, and replace it with a cooperative led by the Communist Party and organized by laboring peasants.
  The work of consolidating existing cooperatives is multifaceted and urgent. It is absolutely wrong to think that completing the percentage of the cooperative plan and the first step of the organizational task is the end of the matter. The established cooperatives must be consolidated economically and politically. In this work, the Party's guiding force must be concentrated, and the work style of cadres must strive to be in-depth. In places where errors of rushing into action have occurred during the period of developing the cooperative, special attention must be paid to emphasizing in-depth work in today's consolidation work, and never turn the rush into action in the development work into a rush back in the consolidation period, or simply and crudely carry out rectification work, so that the weaknesses of the work are covered up by the weaknesses of the work style, leaving behind endless troubles.

### 为什么必须重视农业生产合作社的巩固工作

    为什么必须重视农业生产合作社的巩固工作
    现在全国的农业生产合作社已经发展到五十多万个，接近完成原订的发展计划；目前的主要任务已经不是发展数量，而应集中注意于提高质量，也就是说，应当全面转向巩固工作了。
    有一种有害的思想倾向是必须克服的，那就是重视发展，轻视巩固的思想倾向。
    为什么必须重视合作社的巩固工作呢？这次新发展的合作社，由于种种工作条件和历史条件的影响，其中有一部分是巩固的，有一部分是不巩固的，还有一小部分是很不巩固的；如果不及时帮助这些不巩固的社进行整顿工作，则有一些社可能产生内部不团结、生产混乱以及其他不健康的现象，甚至发生倒退瓦解的危险。因此，有必要进行一段巩固工作。这是很容易理解的。但这些并不足以说明重视巩固工作的全部意义。必须进一步理解的是：农业合作化运动的任务是改变农业中现存的小私有制的生产关系，建立新型的社会主义生产关系，它是给整个乡村中社会主义建设打基础，并从根本上除旧布新的百年大计事业。合作化运动进行得好坏，将决定今后一个历史时期内农村工作的发展状况的好坏。党中央所以一再指示一切领导农村工作的党委必须将农村工作的中心，转向互助合作运动方面来，也就是为了这个原故。
    合作化运动将给今后乡村工作奠定基础，而现有的合作社又为今后整个合作化运动奠定基础。基础是必须打好的。因为要农民接受社会主义新思想，抛弃私有制旧思想，不仅绝对不能依靠强制手段，而且不能单纯依靠一般的政治鼓动工作，主要地应该依靠合作经济优越于单干经营的显明事实去吸引他们，这也就是中央所指示的依靠实例示范方法。去冬今春运动有很大的发展，原因固然很多，其中最有作用的是上年度已办的十万个合作社，绝大部分生产是有发展的，收入是有增加的。如果上年度十万个社办得不好，去冬今春运动发展的成绩是不可想像的。这个经验反映着一条根本的真理，任何一个社会阶级或阶层在革命中的动向，归根到底是由某一种社会制度对他们的经济利害影响来决定的。
    我们有些同志估计现今农民的动向时，喜用“大势所趋”这句话说明农民踊跃加入合作社的心理。问题不在于“大势所趋”这种情形是否存在，而在于怎样理解“大势所趋”所包括的全部意义。如果“大势所趋”是指我们工作做得很好，合作社在经济上发挥了优越性，配合上其他各种社会主义措施，社会主义优势在乡村中已逐步树立，党对农民的政治影响更加深入和加强起来，农民自愿参加合作社业已形成群众性的行动，这自然是可以理解的。如果将“大势所趋”理解为农民在尚未判明经济利害以前，仅因乡村有了社会主义空气就相率闻风而至，这自然是难以理解的。要明白，不同的理解会产生不同的工作方法和不同的工作结果，而理解的错误必然会演成工作中的错误。
    现在全国已加入合作社的农户接近农业户口百分之十五，今后几年内当然还会有更多的农户入社，怎样去进行说服呢？根据前一种正确的理解，应该根据党的工作路线所指示的说服示范的方法，把一批一批的发展起来的合作社办好，通过这些合作社的工作成绩去教育农民，使他们从切身经验中去体会社会主义真理，克服他们从私有制度下接受下来的守旧心理，并通过这些社培养出大批骨干，培养起群众管理集体经营的经验，使群众相信合作社不但对自己是有利的，而且只要成立起来就能办得很好，确实是名符其实的先进的生产组织。这样，参加合作社就会成为群众中的普遍的自愿要求，形成党和政府自上而下帮助支持，农民群众自下而上响应，二者相互结合相互推动的群众性的合作化运动。根据后一种不正确的理解，那就是在合作运动中只注意发展不注意巩固，放松了艰苦的办社工作，连年总是在不巩固的基础上求发展，连年借助于定期突击一轰而起的办法，借助于用不实在的“高涨空气”轰动群众入社的办法去发展合作社，求多不求好，重量不重质，形成脱离群众又不利于生产的错误。
    根据一年来的经验，完全可以肯定，前一种做法是最有实效的，利于运动迅速发展的；后一种做法则效用很低，并且会使运动陷于进退两难的境地。因此，可以得出这样的结论：如果愿意迅速而又健康地开展今后的合作化运动，不仅应该注意有计划地发展新的合作社，不注意发展是不对的；但必须在可靠的基础上求发展，具体地说即应对每一个新发展的合作社及时加以巩固，为下一步的发展做好准备。
    值得注意的是，有许多同志对合作化任务有一种分割看待的观点，把合作化运动局限于只是完成组织农户百分比的任务，而将合作社建成之后的经济工作推脱出去，放到事务的自流过程中去解决。这种思想，反映着对于发展合作社的工作内容和性质缺乏明确的认识。发展合作社是社会主义的经济改革工作，它虽然也是一种经济改革，但和土地改革中的经济改革有所不同。土地改革是变封建占有制为农民所有制，那时经过群众的政治斗争，打破地主对土地的垄断制度，没收分配了土地，改革任务就算完成。至于分配土地之后的经济工作，是可以指望农民自己负责去料理的。因为个体经营的方式，本来是封建制度下早已出现并为农民所熟悉惯用的形式。农民取得土地进行经营并不会发生重大的组织工作上的困难。与这种情形不同，现在的合作化运动，是由农民将自己的土地和其他主要生产资料自愿地联合起来进行集体生产。一个合作社开始建立了组织，初步形成联合，这只能说是工作的起点，而不是它的终点。
    事情很清楚，如果把建立合作社的工作只限于完成征收社员，并由社员推出了自己的管理机关的初步组织手续，至于社的经济工作则任其自流进行，那就大错特错了。党既然负担了组织农业中的社会主义经济的任务，就必须自始至终一贯到底地关注合作社的状况，要了解合作社整个发展过程中的一切详情，从征收社员建立管理组织，到组织劳动生产实行分配，巩固社员间的社会主义团结等等，都要负责给以具体的帮助，使它的经济地位日益巩固，做到不断改进技术，发展生产，增加社员的物质文化福利，不断向前发展、提高。
    重发展轻巩固的思想，实质上就是社会主义建设任务中的自流主义，必须坚决克服。
    对现有合作社的巩固工作必须有系统地持续地进行，这些工作的详细内容我们将在以后再讲。就当前最主要的任务来说：第一，必须组织所有合作社将工作中心转向组织春耕播种的准备工作，如整理土地、抽积种子肥料、保养耕畜等等，以便为全年的生产打下一个基础，为了进行生产，必须在组织集体劳动推行包工制方面，在抽集本年生产资金方面，定出切实的措施。还要以合作社为中心，依托这个中心力量去带动整个农村的春耕生产运动。第二，在组织经济工作的同时，还应注意从政治上巩固社的组织。除抓紧解决社员之间的重要争议问题以巩固全社团结之外，在有不少的社里，有一小部分不稳定的成份，即是少数所谓挂名社员，他们常常在建社之后，借口社里有个别微小的缺点要求退社、对这些社员的问题也应认真解决。我们切不要因这些社员的态度是不正确的，就对他们置之不理或生硬对待。既不可消极地把他们推出社外了事，也不可勉强他们的意志硬留他们在社内，而应该首先从思想上做一番争取工作，耐心地说服他们，使他们认清利害，分清是非，坚定其真正入社的信心。经过这种思想教育工作之后。如果他们宁愿再单干一个时期，看看再来，自然应当允许他们退社，而在退社之后还应继续热情帮助他们。除了解决这一小部分态度摇摆不定的社员的问题之外，还有更重要的一项组织任务，这就是如何在组织上保障合作社的纯洁性。在运动大量迅速发展的条件下，不可避免地会有一批阶级敌人渗入到合作社里，利用这种革命的形式来破坏革命。因为合作社虽然是社会主义经济类型的形式，可是它还存在着被敌对阶级分子和各种反革命分子在某种条件下，为了自己的目的来利用以进行活动的危险。因此，对于一些业已查明确系被反革命分子、地主富农分子所把持组织的假合作社，必须说通群众依靠群众，解散它改组它，另以共产党所领导的由劳动农民组织的合作社来代替它。
  巩固现有合作社的工作是多面的，迫不及待的。认为完成合作计划百分比，和第一步的组织任务，就万事大吉的想法是绝对错误的。已建成的合作社必须从经济上政治上加以巩固。在这个工作中，党的指导力量必须集中起来，干部工作作风必须力求深入。在发展社的时期出现过一轰而起的错误的地方，今天在巩固工作中必须特别注意强调深入工作，绝不要把发展工作中的一轰而起转化成为巩固时期的一轰而退，或简单粗糙地进行整顿工作，致使工作的弱点被工作作风的弱点掩盖起来，遗留下去，造成无穷后患。
