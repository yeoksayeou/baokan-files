    I Accepted Last Year's Lesson
    Farmer Li Shude, Gucheng Village, Keshan County, Heilongjiang Province
    After the land reform, my family was allocated over five *qing* of land and a large ox. With the development of production, our lives gradually improved. I thought: in the past, I worked for the landlord, suffered a lot, couldn't eat well, couldn't dress well; now that I've finally turned over, and I have money in hand, I must eat and drink well. So, I spent all the money on eating and drinking.

    In 1953, I harvested over 17 *shi* of grain from the over five *qing* of land I planted and sold over 3,000 *jin* to the state, earning over 1.7 million yuan. At that time, my brain wasn't working, and I still didn't want to use the money for production. I thought: having an ox in the mutual aid team is enough for farming, there's no need to add carts and horses. Besides, the production cooperative is about to be established, buying carts and horses won't prevent them from being used by everyone. So, during the Spring Festival, I spent about 600,000 yuan to buy a large, fat pig weighing over 200 *jin* to slaughter and eat. The remaining money, apart from the over 200,000 yuan spent on buying cloth and the 150,000 yuan saved, was all spent haphazardly.

    In the spring of 1954, just after planting the land, difficulties arose: there was no feed for the ox, the soybean cakes were all gone, and I stared blankly with no money to buy more! Fortunately, I borrowed 100,000 yuan from others, plus the 150,000 yuan I had saved, and bought ten soybean cakes, which was a lifesaver. At this time, I realized: wasting money was a big loss, and I wouldn't do such a foolish thing again next year!

    1954 was a bumper year. After finishing the threshing, I signed up to join the agricultural production cooperative. This year, my family harvested over 18,000 *jin* of grain. After deducting public grain, food grain, seeds, and feed, I sold the remaining over 9,000 *jin* all to the state, earning over 5.4 million yuan. This time, accepting last year's lesson, I made the correct arrangements for the over 5 million yuan: I used over 1.4 million yuan to buy a rubber-tired cart, another 1.3 million yuan to buy a large ox, saved 500,000 yuan, and the remaining money, apart from what was used for living expenses, was all invested in the agricultural cooperative. I calculated this account clearly: buying an ox and a cart and contributing them to the cooperative still means they are my own, and the cooperative doesn't use them for nothing; if the agricultural cooperative has one more cart and one more ox, it has that much more strength, and if the cooperative harvests more grain, I will also increase my income along with it.

    我接受了去年的教训
    黑龙江省克山县古城村农民　李树德
    土地改革后，我家分到了五垧多地、一头大牛，随着生产的发展，生活渐渐好起来了。我想：过去给地主扛活，受了不少罪，吃不着好的，穿不着好的；这回好容易翻身了，手头宽绰了，可得吃点喝点。就这样，把钱都花到吃喝上去了。
      一九五三年我种的五垧多地打了十七石多粮，卖给国家三千多斤，得了一百七十多万元钱。那时我的脑筋不开缝，还是不愿意把钱用到生产上去。我想：在互助组里有一头牛就能种地，用不着添车买马了。再说又快成立生产合作社了，买车买马挡不了被大家使唤。所以过春节的时候，我就花六十来万元买了一口二百来斤的大肥猪杀吃了。剩下的钱，除了买布用的二十多万元和储蓄十五万元以外，都七零八碎地乱花了。
    一九五四年春天，地刚种完，困难就来了：喂牛的料没有了，豆饼也光了，干瞪着眼睛没钱去买！幸亏向别人借了十万元，加上储蓄的那十五万元，买到了十块豆饼，算是救了急。这时我才醒悟：胡花钱可吃了大亏了，来年说啥也不办这样的糊涂事了！
    一九五四年是一个丰收年头。打完了场我就报名入了农业生产合作社。这一年我家打了一万八千多斤粮食，除了公粮、吃粮、种籽和饲料，剩下九千多斤全部卖给国家了，得了五百四十多万元。这回接受去年的教训，我把五百多万元作了正确的安排：用一百四十多万元买一台花轮车，再用一百三十万元买一头大牛，储蓄了五十万元，剩下的钱除了生活上用的以外，都投到农业社了。我算清了这个账：买牛买车入到社里还是自己的，社里也不白使唤；农业社多一台车、一头牛，就多一分力量，社里多打了粮食，我就也跟着增加收入了。
