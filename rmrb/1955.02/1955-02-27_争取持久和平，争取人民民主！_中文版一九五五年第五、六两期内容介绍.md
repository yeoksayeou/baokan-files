The Chinese editions of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' organ, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Issues 5 and 6 of 1955, have been published successively.

Issue 5, in its editorial entitled "A Program for Further Greatly Developing Soviet Grain Production and Animal Husbandry," points out that since the September 1953 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, the necessary conditions for further strong growth have been obtained in various sectors of Soviet agriculture. However, the Soviet Communist Party is never satisfied with the achievements already made. It has put forward the task of overcoming the backwardness of animal husbandry and greatly increasing the production of grain, potatoes and other vegetables, industrial crops, and animal products in the coming years. The editorial states that the tasks put forward by the Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee are indeed grand, and only a powerful Soviet state has the strength to accomplish them.

Issue 5 contains important articles such as: "The Task of Strengthening the Regular Contact Between the Party and the Working Masses," by Bolesław Bierut, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party; "Smash the Plans of the Warmongers, Change France's Policy," by Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party; and "After the Eleventh Congress of the Belgian Communist Party," by Ernest Burnelle, Secretary of the Belgian Communist Party.

Bierut's article is an abstract of his recent report at the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party. The article describes the achievements of Poland's socialist economic construction over the past five years, puts forward the new tasks for the final year of Poland's Six-Year Plan – 1955, discusses the shortcomings existing in the Party's organizational life, and the issue of the Party's contact with the working masses. The article specifically mentions the role of the local committees of the Polish National Front.

Thorez's article is an abstract of his speech at the closing session of the French Communist Party Central Committee plenary session in January. The article emphasizes that every Party member should do their best to mobilize the vast majority of the people against the rearmament of West Germany and against the serious threat of atomic war. We must strive to get the French government to change its policies.

Issue 6 devoted a large amount of space to publishing the various documents of the Second Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and Khrushchev's report on increasing livestock production, made at the CPSU Central Committee plenary session on January 25.

This issue also contains an article by Lin Boqu, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, "The Sino-Soviet Fraternal Alliance – A Fortress of Peace in the Far East and the World." (Xinhua News Agency)

    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五五年第五、第六两期中文版已经先后出版。
    第五期在题为“进一步大力发展苏联谷物生产和畜牧业的纲领”的社论中指出：自从苏共中央一九五三年九月全会到现在，苏联农业各部门已经获得进一步强大高涨的必要条件。但是苏联共产党从来不满足于已得的成就。它提出了克服畜牧业落后现象的任务并要在今后几年内大大提高谷物、马铃薯和其他蔬菜、工业作物和畜产品的生产。社论说：苏共中央全会提出的任务确实是宏大的，只有强大的苏维埃国家才有力量来完成这些任务。
    第五期刊载的重要文章有：波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记贝鲁特的“为加强党和劳动群众的经常联系而斗争的任务”，法国共产党总书记多列士的“粉碎战争贩子的计划，改变法国的施政方针”，比利时共产党书记伯内尔的“比利时共产党第十一次代表大会举行以后”等。
    贝鲁特的文章是他最近在波兰统一工人党中央全会上的报告摘要。文章叙述了五年来波兰社会主义经济建设的成就，提出了波兰六年计划最后一年——一九五五年的新任务，谈到了党组织生活中存在的缺点，以及党和劳动群众的联系问题。文章特别提到了波兰全国阵线各地方委员会的作用。
    多列士的文章是他一月间在法共中央全会闭幕会议上的发言摘要。文章着重指出：每一个党员应当尽力动员绝大多数人民反对重新武装西德，反对原子战争的严重威胁。我们要努力促使法国政府改变施政方针。
    第六期以大量篇幅刊载了苏联最高苏维埃第二次会议的各项文件和赫鲁晓夫在一月二十五日苏共中央全会上所作的关于增加畜牧业产品生产的报告。
