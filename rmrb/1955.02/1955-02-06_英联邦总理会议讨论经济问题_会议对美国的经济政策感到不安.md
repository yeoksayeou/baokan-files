Xinhua News Agency, London, February 5th (TASS): According to Reuters: The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference discussed economic issues at its morning session on the 3rd.

During British Chancellor of the Exchequer Butler's overview of the sterling area's economic, financial, and trade situation, and in the speeches of other attendees, there was a revealed sense of unease about U.S. economic policies. It was clear from Butler's remarks that countries in the sterling area believe the United States must relax its import restrictions. New Zealand Prime Minister Holland expressed clear dissatisfaction with U.S. foreign trade policies, saying that U.S. dumping policies pose a threat to New Zealand's meat and dairy exports. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was also discussed at the meeting. It is known that some Commonwealth countries are dissatisfied with this agreement, believing that the United States is using it to harm their interests. The "Daily Express" reflected the views of some Commonwealth figures, sharply criticizing Britain's participation in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The "Daily Express" editorial wrote: "President Eisenhower and others verbally state their commitment to the principles of free trade as stipulated in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but in reality, the United States is taking the opposite approach." Under these circumstances, "representatives of the Commonwealth countries should realize that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is a tool for enslaving others."

Xinhua News Agency, February 5th: According to a report by the Associated Press from London, it was revealed that British Defense Minister Harold Macmillan, during the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference's discussion on "defense" on the 1st, stated that Britain would establish a so-called flying "fire brigade" to suppress "small-scale wars" in Asia, the Middle East, or Africa where people are fighting for national independence. This mobile strategic reserve force, called the "fire brigade," is also part of Britain's "grand strategy," which "relies" on "the U.S. strategic air force and Britain's own gradually growing atomic bomber force."

The news stated that existing British domestic troops have already been formed into this "fire brigade," and the troops withdrawn from the Suez Canal Zone will also be formed into another division of such troops. In addition, an air transport force will be established to transport these troops to where they are needed at any time.

The news also said: These troops will be sent to some areas controlled by Britain. Their first task will be to support ground forces in attacking guerrillas in the Malayan Peninsula. Moreover, these troops will also be "sent to areas outside British spheres of influence if the governments of these areas request assistance." It is said that Britain has already requested some Commonwealth countries to provide air bases and transit rights so that these troops can be quickly transported to "trouble spots."

    英联邦总理会议讨论经济问题
    会议对美国的经济政策感到不安
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社伦敦四日讯：据路透社报道：英联邦国家总理会议三日上午会议讨论经济问题。
    在英国财政大臣巴特勒概述英镑地区的经济、财政和贸易情况的发言中和其他出席会议的人的发言中都透露出他们对美国经济政策感到不安的情绪。从巴特勒的发言中可以看出，英镑地区国家认为美国必须放松它的入口限制。新西兰总理赫兰在发言中对美国的对外贸易政策明显地表示不满，他说，美国的倾销政策对新西兰的肉类和乳制品的出口是一种威胁。会上还谈到了关于关税与贸易总协定的问题。大家知道，有些英联邦国家不满意这一协定，它们认为，美国利用这一协定损害这些国家的利益。“每日快报”反映了某些英联邦人士的意见，它尖锐地指责英国参加关税与贸易总协定。“每日快报”的社论写道：“艾森豪威尔总统和其他一些人口头上说要忠实于在关税与贸易总协定中所规定的自由贸易的原则，但是实际上美国却采取相反的做法。”在这种情形之下，“英联邦国家的代表们应该认识到，关税和贸易总协定是奴役别人的工具。”【新华社五日讯】据美联社记者从伦敦发出的消息说，有人透露英国国防大臣哈罗德·麦克米伦一日在英联邦总理会议讨论“防务”问题时曾经表示，英国要建立一支所谓飞行“救火队”，来镇压亚洲、中东或者非洲人民争取民族独立的“小冲突战争”。这种叫作“救火队”的机动的战略后备队，同时又是英国的“大战略”的一部分，而这种“大战略”的“依靠”就是“美国的战略空军和英国自己逐渐成长起来的原子弹空军”。
    这个消息说，英国国内的军队已经编成这种“救火队”了，从苏彝士运河区撤回英国的军队也要编成另一师这样的军队。此外，还要建立一支空中运输队，以便随时把这些军队运送到需要的地方去。
    消息又说：这些军队将派到英国控制的一些地区。他们的第一项任务将是支援地面部队进攻马来亚半岛的游击队。而且这些军队也会被“派到非英国势力范围的地区去，如果这些地区的政府要求援助的话”。据说，英国已经要求某些英联邦国家提供空军基地和过境权利，使这些军队能够很快地运到“出事地点”去。
