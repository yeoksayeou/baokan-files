The United States Information Service published a "background material" on the 11th of this month, finding three "reasons" for the United States' occupation of Taiwan: "legal," "military," and "moral." This shows how the American aggressor group is racking its brains to try to justify its act of aggression against China in front of world opinion. However, nothing in the world can cover up the United States' crime of aggression. The "background material" concocted by the United States Information Service only reveals, with its attempt to cover up, that American imperialism is an evil aggressor.

What is the "legal" basis found by the United States Information Service? It turns out to be the "Treaty of Shimonoseki" of 1895. According to the United States Information Service, "Taiwan has never belonged to China" since the 1895 "Treaty of Shimonoseki."

But everyone knows that the "Treaty of Shimonoseki" was a treaty by which Japanese imperialism invaded Chinese territory. Except for the Japanese imperialists of the time and the aggressors who followed in their footsteps, no one recognizes that this aggressive treaty has legal effect. Moreover, China formally declared on December 8, 1941, that all treaties between China and Japan, including the "Treaty of Shimonoseki," were abolished. After that, the "Cairo Declaration" of 1943 and the "Potsdam Proclamation" of 1945, two international documents, both affirmed and recognized that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands were Chinese territory and clearly declared that they should be returned to China after the war. The United States is a signatory to both of these documents. This proves that the United States at that time also believed that the "Treaty of Shimonoseki" was invalid. The late American President Roosevelt said on December 24, 1943, when talking about the principles of the "Cairo Declaration,"
	"These principles are simple and basic, including the return of stolen property to its rightful owner."

China took over Taiwan and the Penghu Islands from Japan on October 25, 1945, in accordance with the "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation," and restored its sovereignty over them. This is a fact that the U.S. government has repeatedly acknowledged. The Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands is an exercise of sovereignty in their own territory, which is a completely legitimate act. The United States Information Service disregards the "Cairo Declaration" and the "Potsdam Proclamation," which are binding on the United States, disregards the fact that the United States has recognized that China has exercised sovereignty in Taiwan, and attempts to use the "Treaty of Shimonoseki," which is recognized as invalid, as a "legal" basis to prove that the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan is "illegal," while the United States' occupation of Taiwan seems to be "legal." This proves that the American aggressor group is the same as the Japanese imperialists of the time, or even more brutal aggressors.

The United States Information Service also said that Japan abandoned all rights to Taiwan and the Penghu Islands after the war, but "no government or regime was named as the recipient of these territories." In other words, the "status" of Taiwan is "undetermined."

As mentioned above, Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are Chinese territory, and this status has long been determined, and there is no question of "nomination" and "acceptance." What is the purpose of the United States Information Service deliberately fabricating this question? Obviously, judging from the United States' self-proclaimed role as the "protector" of Taiwan, the so-called "nomination" is of course intended to be made by the United States. Who should be "nominated"? If "nomination" is given to China, why would the United States be so actively engaged in war like it is now? Needless to say, the United States wants to "nominate" itself. The United States "nominates" the United States to "accept" Taiwan. This is the entire scheme of the United States acting as the successor of Japanese imperialism, inheriting the "Treaty of Shimonoseki," and taking Taiwan and the Penghu Islands for its own.

In addition to the so-called "legal" reasons, the United States Information Service cited the real reason for the United States' occupation of Taiwan - military reasons. The United States Information Service does not conceal that the occupation of Taiwan is to consolidate and strengthen aggressive military alliances such as the ANZUS Treaty, the Manila Treaty, and the U.S.-Japan Mutual Security Treaty, and everyone knows that all these treaties are part of the United States' plan to organize a military aggression system in the Far East and prepare for a new war. The United States' occupation of Taiwan has taken a big step forward in the preparation for a new war of aggression. In order to cover up the United States' aggressive ambitions, the United States Information Service slanders that the Chinese people will carry out so-called "aggression" in the Pacific after liberating Taiwan. But just looking at the U.S. military aggression bases all over the Pacific region, this slander against the Chinese people is worthless.

The United States Information Service finally racked its brains and came up with a so-called "moral" reason, and sickeningly called it "the most important consideration in official considerations in Washington." It is said that if the Chinese people liberate Taiwan, the people of Taiwan will lose their "democratic freedom." The United States Information Service also described the residents of Dachen Island being taken away by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous group as their own "choice." But the facts have long shattered this lie. The so-called "democratic freedom" in Taiwan under the rule of the U.S.-Chiang regime is synonymous with the "police state" recognized by Wu Guozhen, who ran away from Taiwan to the United States. The residents of Dachen Island being robbed to Taiwan under the coercion of American machine guns, and all the houses on the island being burned down, is the most recent example of this "democratic freedom." It is very clear that if it were not for the United States hindering the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, the people of Taiwan would have gained real democratic freedom long ago. It is the American aggressor group that prevents the people of Taiwan from gaining real democratic freedom until now.

The United States' occupation of Taiwan violates all laws and common sense. As British Labor MP Ian Mikardo said, this is "worse than a crime - it's downright stupid." The United States Information Service's futile attempt to cover up the United States' aggressive acts only makes the American aggressor group lose face and make a fool of itself in front of the world once again.

    又一次丢脸出丑
    蒋元椿
    美国新闻处在本月十一日发表了一篇“背景材料”，替美国侵占台湾找出了三个“原因”：“法律上”的、“军事上”的和“道义上”的。这说明美国侵略集团是怎样挖空心思企图在世界舆论面前替它侵略中国的行为进行狡辩。但是，世界上没有任何东西能够掩饰得了美国的侵略罪行。美国新闻处绞尽脑汁编造出来的“背景材料”，只不过欲盖弥彰地暴露了美帝国主义是万恶的侵略者。
    美国新闻处找到的“法律”根据是什么呢？原来竟是一八九五年的“马关条约”。据美国新闻处说，从一八九五年“马关条约”以来，“台湾就一直不属于中国”。
    但是谁都知道，“马关条约”是日本帝国主义侵略中国领土的条约。除了当年的日本帝国主义和步它的后尘的侵略者而外，谁也不承认这种侵略条约有法律效力。何况中国在一九四一年十二月八日已经正式宣布废止中日间一切条约，包括“马关条约”在内。在此以后，一九四三年的“开罗宣言”和一九四五年的“波茨坦公告”这两个国际文件，都肯定承认台湾和澎湖是中国的领土，并且明白宣告它们应该在战后归还中国。美国是这两个文件的签字国。这就证明美国在当时也认为“马关条约”是无效的。美国已故的总统罗斯福在一九四三年十二月二十四日谈到“开罗宣言”的原则时就说过，
  “这些原则既简单，又基本，其中包括归还偷盗的财产给当然的主人。”
    中国在一九四五年十月二十五日根据“开罗宣言”和“波茨坦公告”从日本手中接收了台湾和澎湖，恢复了对它们的主权。这是美国政府一再承认过的事实。中国人民解放台湾和澎湖，是在自己的领土上行使主权，这是完全合法的行为。美国新闻处撇开对美国有约束力的“开罗宣言”和“波茨坦公告”，撇开美国承认过的中国已在台湾行使主权的事实，企图用公认为无效的“马关条约”作为
  “法律”根据，来证明中国人民解放台湾是“非法”的，而美国侵占台湾倒似乎是“合法”的。这就证明美国侵略集团和当年日本帝国主义是一样的甚至是更横暴的侵略者。
    美国新闻处又说，战后日本放弃了对台湾和澎湖的一切权利，但是“没有一个政府或政权被提名为这些领土的接受者”。换句话说，就是台湾的“地位尚未确定”。
    照前面所说的，台湾和澎湖是中国的领土，这个地位早已确定，根本不发生什么“提名”和“接受”的问题。美国新闻处故意捏造出这个问题来是为了什么目的呢？显然，从美国以台湾的“保护者”自居的姿态看来，所谓“提名”当然是想由美国来“提名”。“提名”给谁呢？如果“提名”给中国，美国何必像现在这样大动干戈？用不着说，美国是想“提名”给美国。由美国“提名”美国“接受”台湾。这就是美国充当了日本帝国主义的继承人，继承“马关条约”，将台湾和澎湖据为己有的全部计谋。
    除了所谓“法律上”的原因以外，美国新闻处举出了美国侵占台湾的真正原因——军事上的原因。美国新闻处毫不掩饰，侵占台湾是为了巩固和加强像澳新美条约、马尼拉条约、美日共同安全条约这一类侵略性的军事联盟，而谁都知道，所有这些条约都是美国在远东组织军事侵略体系、准备新战争的计划的一部分。美国侵占台湾，就在新的侵略战争的准备中大大前进了一步。美国新闻处为了掩饰美国的侵略野心，诬蔑中国人民解放台湾以后会在太平洋进行所谓“侵略”。但是只要看看遍布在太平洋地区的美国的军事侵略基地，这种对中国人民的诬蔑就一文不值。
    美国新闻处最后绞尽脑汁想出了一个所谓“道义上”的原因，并且令人作呕地把它说成“在华盛顿的官方考虑中占最重要的地位”。据说，如果中国人民解放了台湾，台湾人民就丧失了“民主自由”。美国新闻处并且把大陈岛的居民被美国和蒋介石卖国集团劫走，说成是他们自己“选择”的。但是事实早已把这种扯谎打得粉碎了。在美蒋统治下的台湾的所谓“民主自由”，就是从台湾跑到美国去的吴国桢所承认的“警察国家”的代名词。大陈岛的居民在美国机枪的胁迫下被劫往台湾，岛上的房屋全被烧光，就是这种“民主自由”的最近的例子。十分明显，如果不是美国阻挠中国人民解放台湾，台湾人民早就得到了真正的民主自由。使台湾人民到现在还不能得到真正的民主自由的，正是美国的侵略集团。
    美国侵占台湾的行为，违背了一切法理和常情。正如英国工党议员伊安·米卡多所说的，这“比犯罪行为还要坏——这简直是十足愚蠢的做法”。美国新闻处徒然地企图掩饰美国的侵略行径，只不过使美国侵略集团在全世界面前又一次丢脸出丑。
