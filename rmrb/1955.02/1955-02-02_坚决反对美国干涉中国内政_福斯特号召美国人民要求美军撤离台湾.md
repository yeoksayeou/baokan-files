Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 1st: William Foster, Chairman of the American Communist Party, published an article in the "Worker's Daily" in New York on January 26th, entitled "The Threat of the Taiwan War." The article stated:

    The U.S. government, inheriting the traditions of old imperialism, has occupied Taiwan, which is undoubtedly part of the territory of the People's China, and intends to cling to this island even at the cost of a third world war. The President's message to Congress means that he intends to use American armed forces to "defend" Taiwan. The arrogant attitude of the U.S. government in occupying this Chinese island has reached an extreme degree.

    The article pointed out that it is clear that Eisenhower and his Wall Street bosses have not learned a very basic lesson. That is: the era when imperialist powers could break into and arbitrarily occupy the territory of the Chinese people is gone forever. Half a century ago, imperialists could and did commit such lawless acts of violence with impunity, but now, this is no longer the case. The Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, will prove that they are fully capable of defending their motherland.

    The article said that the American people are shocked and terrified to see that anti-American sentiment has greatly increased in almost every country in the world. This is a reflection of the extreme arrogance and aggressiveness of Wall Street's foreign policy. The seizure of Taiwan is just another example in this disgraceful record.

    This event will add fuel to the flames of anti-American sentiment spreading in the world. This will further convince people around the world that the United States, under the control of its current monopoly capitalist rulers, is a threat to world peace and democracy.

    In his article, Foster called on the American people, especially organized labor and its political allies, to demand the immediate withdrawal of all American armed forces from Taiwan.

Robertson Publishes Article in "Pravda"

    American Citizens Protest the U.S. Government's War Policy

    Xinhua News Agency, January 31st: According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow on January 30th, "Pravda" published an article written by Paul Robeson, a famous American peace activist and black singer. Robeson wrote that the recent resolution of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council calling for intensified struggle against the threat of atomic war is of great significance to the people of all countries. When people in the United States strive for peace, they particularly feel the danger facing humanity. The United States has become a base for reactionaries, a small but powerful group supported by big industrial and financial capital. Their propaganda, reminiscent of Goebbels, has created an atmosphere of hysteria and violence. The American people are indeed very alarmed. Millions of citizens are protesting this dangerous policy in various ways through their religious and civic groups. These days, they are particularly disturbed by actions aimed at worsening the situation in the Far East. The American people, like the people of other countries, know that the Chiang Kai-shek clique on Taiwan Island is nothing more than a gang of rogues who can never represent the Chinese people.

    Robeson pointed out that the American people are aware of the serious dangers arising from the invention of atomic and hydrogen weapons. They attach great importance to the arguments of the Soviet delegation attending the United Nations. Therefore, in accordance with the call of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, the stockpiled atomic bombs that threaten world culture must be destroyed, and the manufacture of such weapons must be permanently banned, so that the discovery of atomic energy can be used for various constructive works of mankind.

    Robeson said he is convinced that the World Peace Council's new call against atomic war will be immediately and warmly supported by the American people. He concluded by saying: If we unleash our great potential power in action, we can save peace for ourselves and our children.

Australian Communist Party Chairman Dixon Says

    Australians Should Never Support U.S. Occupation of Taiwan

    Xinhua News Agency, February 1st: Sydney News: According to the January 26th "Tribune," L.L. Dixon, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Australian Communist Party, said that the liberation of Taiwan and the unification of Taiwan and the mainland is the internal affair of the Chinese people and their democratic government. He said that the U.S. decision to fully intervene in the Taiwan area is an attempt to use Taiwan as a base for imperialist aggression against the Chinese mainland.

    Dixon asked, pointing out that the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang has repeatedly announced their intention to attack the mainland: "Where do they expect to get the troops to attack the mainland from, other than from the United States?"

    He said that the Chinese people cannot tolerate the existence of a foreign war base on Chinese territory.

    Dixon warned that the U.S. decision to fully intervene in the Taiwan area is an extremely serious matter for Australians. He pointed out that under the ANZUS Treaty, Australia could easily be drawn into any war the United States might participate in.

    Dixon said that democratic Australians must show the Menzies government that Australian troops should never be sacrificed to maintain Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship in power.

    Lou A. King, Secretary of the New South Wales Labor Conference, commented on the U.S. decision on the Taiwan area on January 25th, telling a "Tribune" reporter, "There are elements of a world war in the current Taiwan situation."

    Bummer, Chairman of the New South Wales Building Workers Union, said that Chiang Kai-shek is not worth an Australian shedding a drop of blood. Bummer said, "No honest Australian would support Chiang Kai-shek and his American masters."

British "Daily Worker" Editorial Says

    Must Cry Out Loud to Prevent American Bloody Hands from Interfering in China

    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 1st: The London "Daily Worker" editorial on January 31st said: The situation in the Far East is serious. The British government had the power to avoid danger, but it seems to be increasing the danger.

    The so-called ceasefire initiative came from the British government. Before making this proposal, Eisenhower indicated that he was willing for others to make the proposal.

    If Eisenhower wanted to end American aggression against China, and wanted to give the ceasefire a diplomatic cover so that American military forces could withdraw from Chinese territory, territorial waters, and airspace, then a way to do this smoothly could be found.

    The editorial then pointed out that this is not the purpose for which the word "ceasefire" is currently being used. This word is used to deceive the people.

    In the past two weeks, the United States has greatly increased its military build-up throughout the dangerous area. The proposal advocating a ceasefire should be seen as part of these new and dangerous military actions.

    The editorial said: The direct purpose of the United States is to obtain some kind of legal and United Nations support for its occupation of Taiwan. This would give the United States the freedom and time to strengthen all the forces it needs to wage war against the rest of China.

    The editorial also said that if it is insisted that the United States needs Taiwan as an outpost of its defense circle, then drawing a circle centered on the United States would virtually include the entire world.

    The editorial emphasized that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory. Regardless of what Eden's knowledge of geography in this century might lead him to understand, Taiwan has been Chinese for a long time before the Normans came to England.

    The editorial concluded: We must cry out loudly and tell the U.S. government not to interfere in China with its bloody hands.

Yugoslav "Liberation Daily" Says

    The United States Wants to Use the United Nations as a Screen for Interfering in China

    Xinhua News Agency, February 1st: According to a TASS dispatch from Belgrade on February 1st, the Yugoslav "Liberation Daily" wrote that the United States is trying to use the United Nations to implement its policy toward China. The "Liberation Daily" said that if the United States really succeeds, the United Nations will find itself forced to play the role of a screen to cover up interference in China's national affairs. If it were to do so, the opposition of most Asian countries and countries in other parts of the world would be inevitable.

    坚决反对美国干涉中国内政
    福斯特号召美国人民要求美军撤离台湾
    【新华社柏林一日电】美国共产党主席威廉·福斯特一月二十六日在纽约“工人日报”上发表了一篇文章，题目是“台湾战争的威胁”。文章说：
    美国政府承袭着旧帝国主义的传统，霸占了肯定地是人民中国领土的一部分的台湾，并打算甚至不惜进行第三次世界大战来死抱住这个岛屿。总统给国会的咨文的本意就是说，他有意要用美国的武装部队来“保卫”台湾。美国政府霸占这个中国岛屿所持的狂妄态度到了极端的程度。
    文章指出，很明显，艾森豪威尔和他的华尔街的后台老板还没有领受到一个极为基本的教训。这就是：帝国主义列强可以闯入中国人民的领土并肆意霸占的时代是一去不复返了。半世纪以前，帝国主义者能够而且也确实犯了这种无法无天的强暴行为而没有受到惩罚，但是现在，这种事情已不复存在。中国人民在共产党领导下，将证明他们是完全有能力保卫他们的祖国的。
    文章说，美国人民看到差不多世界上每个国家里的反美情绪都大大上升，感到震惊和惶恐。这是华尔街外交政策的极端狂妄和充满侵略性的反映。强占台湾只是这种不光彩记录中的又一事例而已。
    这件事将是在世界蔓延着的反美情绪的火焰上加油。这件事将进一步使世界各地人民相信，在目前的垄断资本家统治者控制下的美国是对世界和平和民主的威胁。
    福斯特在文章中号召美国人民，特别是有组织的劳工和它的政治同盟者，要求立即把一切美国武装部队撤离台湾。罗伯逊在“真理报”发表文章说
    美国公民抗议美国政府的战争政策
    【新华社三十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科三十日讯：“真理报”发表了美国著名和平人士、黑人歌唱家保罗·罗伯逊写的一篇文章，罗伯逊写道，最近世界和平理事会常务委员会会议关于号召为反对原子战争威胁而加强斗争的决议，对各国人民都具有重大的意义。人们在美国为争取和平而努力时，特别感觉到人类面临的危险。美国已经成了反动分子的大本营，他们是一小撮然而有势力的集团，受到大工业和金融资本的支持。他们那令人回想起戈培尔的宣传已经造成了一种歇斯底里和暴力的气氛。美国人民的确都非常惊惶。千百万公民正在通过他们的宗教团体和民间团体以各种各样的方式，抗议这种危险的政策。这些日子来，目的在于使远东局势恶化的种种行动特别使他们感到不安。美国人民同其他各国人民一样，知道台湾岛上的蒋介石集团只不过是一群无赖匪帮，他们绝不能代表中国人民。
    罗伯逊指出，美国人民是认识到随着原子武器和氢武器的发明而产生的严重危险的。他们极端重视出席联合国的苏联代表团的论据。因此，必须根据世界和平理事会常务委员会的号召，毁掉储存的威胁世界文化的原子弹，并且永远禁止制造这种武器，而使关于原子能的发现用来从事人类的各种建设工作。
    罗伯逊说，他深信，世界和平理事会关于反对原子战争的新号召，将立即受到美国人民的热烈支持。他最后说：假如我们在行动中发挥我们的巨大的潜在力量，我们便能为我们自己和我们的孩子们拯救和平。澳共主席狄克逊说
    澳大利亚人绝不应支持美国侵占台湾
    【新华社一日讯】悉尼消息：据一月二十六日的“论坛报”报道，澳大利亚共产党中央委员会主席鲁·狄克逊说，解放台湾以及台湾和大陆的统一，是中国人民和他们的民主政府的内政。他说，美国决定全面干涉台湾地区，是企图把台湾当作帝国主义者侵略中国大陆的基地。
    狄克逊在指出蒋介石匪帮曾一再宣布他们进攻大陆的意图时问道：“除了从美国之外，他们期望从哪里得到进攻大陆的军队呢？”
    他说，中国人民不能容忍在中国领土上存在一个外国战争基地。
    狄克逊警告说，美国决定全面干涉台湾地区，对澳大利亚人来说，是一件极其严重的事情。他指出，根据澳新美条约，澳大利亚很容易就会被卷入美国可能参加的任何战争。
    狄克逊说，民主的澳大利亚人必须向孟席斯政府表明，绝不应为了保持蒋介石的独裁统治当权而使澳大利亚军队遭到牺牲。
    新南威尔士劳工会议书记鲁·阿·金在一月二十五日评论美国对台湾地区的决定时对“论坛报”记者说，“在目前台湾局势中有着世界大战的因素”。
    新南威尔士建筑工人工会主席布默说，蒋介石不值得澳大利亚人流一滴血。布默说，“没有一个正直的澳大利亚人会支持蒋介石和他的美国主子”。英国“工人日报”社论说
    必须大声疾呼不让美国血手干涉中国
    【新华社柏林一日电】伦敦“工人日报”一月三十一日的社论说：远东的局势是严重的。英国政府本来有力量避免危险，但是，看来它却在使危险增加。
    所谓停火的倡议是从英国政府提出的。在提出这个建议前，艾森豪威尔表示他愿意别人来提出这个建议。
    如果艾森豪威尔想结束美国对中国的侵略，想给停火以外交的掩护以便美国军事力量撤出中国的领土、领海和领空，那么要顺利地做到这一点的办法是能够找到的。
    社论接着指出，这并不是目前使用“停火”这个字眼的目的。这个字眼是用来欺骗人民的。
    在过去两个星期中，美国大大增加了它在整个危险地区的军事集结。应当把主张停火的建议看作是这些新的、危险的军事行动的一部分。
    社论说：美国的直接目的是要使得它占领台湾取得某种法律上的和联合国的支持。这样就可以给予美国自由的权力和时间来加强它对中国其余地区进行战争所需要的一切力量。
    社论又说，如果硬说美国需要台湾作为它的防御圈的一个前哨，那要以美国为中心划一个圈实际上就包括整个世界了。
    社论强调说，台湾是中国领土的一部分。不论艾登对本世纪的地理知识可能使他怎样了解，在诺曼人到英格兰来以前很久台湾就已经是中国的。
    社论最后说：我们必须大声疾呼，而且告诉美国政府，不要用它的血手干涉中国。南斯拉夫“解放报”说
    美国想利用联合国作干涉中国的屏风
    【新华社一日讯】据塔斯社贝尔格莱德一日讯：南斯拉夫“解放报”写道，美国正在设法利用联合国来执行它对中国的政策。“解放报”说，如果美国真的成功了，联合国就会发现自己被迫担任了掩盖对中国国家事务的干涉的屏风的角色。如果竟然这样做的话，大多数亚洲国家和世界其他地区的国家的反对将是不可避免的。
