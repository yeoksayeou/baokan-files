Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th dispatch: The Soviet of Nationalities of the Supreme Soviet continued its meeting on the morning of the 5th to discuss the draft of the Soviet National Budget for 1955.

In their speeches, the representatives enthusiastically supported the 1955 National Budget and unanimously agreed that the budget reflected the achievements of the Soviet state in all aspects and guaranteed the rapid surge of the national economy and the further development of culture. Many representatives also spoke about the great achievements of the entire Soviet Union and its constituent republics in economic and cultural fields.

Soviet Minister of Agriculture I. Benediktov emphasized in his speech the great significance of the recent resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union "On Increasing the Production of Livestock Products." He said that according to the provisions of this resolution, the Soviet Union's meat production will increase by an average of three times per year in the next few years, milk will increase by an average of more than six times, and eggs will increase by 2.3 times. Such a rate of increase in agricultural production is unprecedented in Soviet history. Benediktov then talked about the development of agricultural mechanization in the Soviet Union, saying that 80% of all funds allocated to the Ministry of Agriculture by the state in 1955 will be used as funds for machine tractor stations. Most of the agricultural machinery will be sent to the eastern reclamation areas in the country to ensure the completion of the huge plan to reclaim virgin and fallow land.

Russian Federation Minister of Education I. Kairov spoke in his speech about the achievements of the Russian Federation in cultural education. He said that the Russian Federation built and put into use a total of 940 new school buildings in 1954 and published more than 150 million textbooks. The Russian Federation has achieved considerable success in implementing universal ten-year education. This year, the number of students in the eighth to tenth grades of secondary schools is 2.3 million more than in 1950. This year, 117 large cities in the Russian Federation will complete the work of universal ten-year education.

Representatives of the Kirghiz, Estonian, Armenian, Turkmen, and Karelo-Finnish republics, as well as Soviet Minister of Food Industry V. Zotov, also spoke in the discussion.

In their speeches, the representatives also talked about the huge potential in the Soviet national economy that can be used to increase industrial and agricultural production, criticized the shortcomings in the work of some management institutions, and put forward specific suggestions for improving work.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th dispatch: The Soviet of the Union of the Supreme Soviet continued its meeting on the evening of the 5th to discuss the draft of the 1955 Soviet National Budget.

During the discussion, representatives from the Russian Federation and the Central Asian, Baltic, and Transcaucasian republics spoke in support of the 1955 Soviet National Budget, citing specific examples to illustrate the great achievements of the Soviet republics in economic and cultural construction.

Uzbek Republic representative A. Alimov said in his speech that the 1955 Soviet National Budget reflects the peaceful policies of the Soviet state. The Uzbek people will strive to realize this budget. When talking about the achievements of the Uzbek Republic in various aspects, he pointed out that the Uzbek Republic has now become an advanced industrialized and agriculturally mechanized country. In the years after the Patriotic War, the cotton production of the Uzbek Republic increased by 72%. In addition to heavy industry, the republic's food, textile, sewing, and other industries producing consumer goods have also been developed. In terms of education, there are now 1.3 million primary and secondary school students and nearly 85,000 students in colleges and technical schools.

Latvian Republic representative Jan Ostrov expressed his satisfaction in his speech that the Soviet National Budget reflects the continuous development of the economy and culture of the multi-ethnic Soviet state and will further satisfy the material and cultural needs of the residents. He cited as an example that 91% of Latvia's 1955 budget allocation was used for social and cultural measures and national economic allocations.

Moscow Soviet Chairman M. Yasnov pointed out that last year, Moscow's factories overfulfilled the plan to reduce product costs, resulting in savings of more than 400 million rubles for the state. In 1954, most of the funds in Moscow's budget were used to develop various sectors of the national economy and housing construction. This year, Moscow will build 1 million square meters of housing, dozens of schools, and many new cultural and welfare institutions.

Soviet Minister of Building Materials Industry P. Yudin also spoke at the meeting.

The next meeting of the Soviet of the Union of the Supreme Soviet will be held on the 7th.

    各族代表热烈支持今年度苏联国家预算
    【新华社六日讯】　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃民族院五日上午继续举行会议，讨论一九五五年度苏联国家预算草案。
    代表们在发言时热烈支持一九五五年度国家预算，一致认为预算反映了苏维埃国家在各方面所取得的成就，并且保证了国民经济的迅速高涨和文化的进一步发展。许多代表在发言中还谈到了全苏联和各加盟共和国在经济和文化方面的巨大成就。
    苏联农业部部长伊·别涅吉克托夫在发言中着重指出了苏联共产党中央委员会最近通过的“关于增加畜牧业产品生产”的决议的重大意义。他说，根据这个决议的规定，苏联今后几年中肉类的生产量每年将平均增为三倍，牛奶平均增为六倍以上，鸡蛋增为二点三倍。农产品的生产量这样的增加速度，在苏联历史上还是空前的。别涅吉克托夫接着谈到了苏联农业机械化的发展，他说，国家在一九五五年度拨给农业部的全部款项的百分之八十将作为机器拖拉机站的经费。大部分农业机器将送到国内东部开垦地区去，以便保证完成开垦生荒地和熟荒地的巨大计划。
    俄罗斯联邦教育部部长伊·凯罗夫在发言中谈到了俄罗斯联邦文化教育方面的成就。他说，俄罗斯联邦在一九五四年共建成和开始使用了九百四十座新的校舍，并且出版了一亿五千多万册教科书。俄罗斯联邦在实行普及十年制教育方面已经取得了相当大的成绩。今年，中等学校八年级到十年级的学生人数比一九五○年多二百三十万。今年俄罗斯联邦内将有一百十七个大城市完成普及十年制教育的工作。
    在讨论中发言的还有吉尔吉斯、爱沙尼亚、亚美尼亚、土库曼、卡累利阿—芬兰等加盟共和国的代表以及苏联食品工业部部长瓦·佐托夫。
    代表们在发言中还谈到了苏联国民经济中能够用来增加工农业生产的巨大潜力，批评了目前一些管理机构工作中的缺点，并且提出了改进工作的具体建议。
    【新华社六日讯】　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃联盟院五日晚继续举行会议，讨论一九五五年苏联国家预算草案。
    在讨论时，俄罗斯联邦及中亚细亚、波罗的海沿岸和外高加索各加盟共和国的代表都发言支持一九五五年苏联国家预算，并且举出具体事例说明苏联各加盟共和国经济和文化建设的巨大成就。
      乌兹别克共和国代表阿·阿利莫夫在发言时说，一九五五年苏联国家预算反映出苏维埃国家的和平政策。乌兹别克人民将为实现这个预算案而奋斗。他在谈到乌兹别克共和国各方面的成就时指出，乌兹别克共和国现在已经成为一个先进的工业化和农业机械化的国家了。在卫国战争以后的年代中，乌兹别克共和国棉花的产量增加了百分之七十二。除了重工业以外，共和国的食品、纺织、缝纫以及其他生产消费品的工业部门也都获得了发展。在教育方面，现在，中小学生有一百三十万人，高等学校和专科学校学生将近有八万五千人。
      拉脱维亚共和国代表扬·奥斯特洛夫在发言中满意地说，苏联国家预算反映了多民族的苏维埃国家的经济和文化的不断发展，并将使居民的物质和文化需要得到进一步的满足。他举例说，一九五五年拉脱维亚共和国的预算拨款中，有百分之九十一是用于社会和文化措施及国民经济的拨款。
      莫斯科市苏维埃主席米·雅斯诺夫指出，去年，莫斯科各工厂超额完成降低产品成本的计划，结果为国家节约了四亿多卢布。一九五四年，莫斯科的预算中大部分资金用于发展国民经济各部门和住宅建设。今年，莫斯科将建设一百万平方公尺面积的住宅，数十所学校和许多新的文化—福利机关。
