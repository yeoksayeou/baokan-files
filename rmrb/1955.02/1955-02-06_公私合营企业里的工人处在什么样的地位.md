What is the Status of Workers in Joint Public-Private Enterprises?

Some people are still unclear about the status of workers in joint public-private enterprises. Not long ago, the editorial department received a letter from Comrade Wang Peiwu of the Dacheng Textile and Dyeing Company, inquiring about this issue. The letter stated:

Our Dacheng Textile and Dyeing Company was among the first batch of joint public-private enterprises in Jiangsu Province. During the joint operation, we educated the workers about "the significant change in the nature of the enterprise, with workers becoming the masters of the enterprise." Later, during the summary of work, some people felt that this statement was not appropriate:

(1) It easily blurs the masses' understanding of the nature of the enterprise (it is not an enterprise of a socialist nature after all), thereby blurring the direction of struggle.

(2) It easily creates ideological illusions among the masses, leading to a lack of respect for the legitimate rights and interests of capitalists, because capitalists still have a share in the joint venture.

However, later at the East China Joint Public-Private Operation Symposium and in some relevant articles published in the Shanghai Liberation Daily, it was still clearly stated that workers in joint public-private enterprises are "the masters of the enterprise." Moreover, the news report about Hu Weikang, a worker at the Shanghai Xin'an Electric Motor Factory, published on page 2 of the People's Daily on September 9, 1954, was also titled "After Becoming the Master of the Enterprise." Therefore, we specifically ask you: What is the correct way to phrase this?

To understand the status of workers in joint public-private enterprises, one must first understand what changes have occurred when a private enterprise is transformed into a joint public-private enterprise. Comrade Li Weihan pointed out when explaining the Provisional Regulations for Joint Public-Private Industrial Enterprises: When an intermediate form of state capitalism or a capitalist enterprise is transformed into a joint public-private operation, the production relations of the enterprise will undergo the following important changes: First, the enterprise changes from private ownership to joint public-private ownership, with socialist components cooperating with and leading capitalist components within the enterprise. In joint ventures, the legitimate rights and interests of private shares still exist and are protected, but capitalists are under the leadership of the public side, changing their position of controlling the enterprise in the private period. Second, the operation and management of joint ventures no longer adopts capitalist methods, but will gradually align with state-owned enterprises, fully guided by the development of production, ensuring needs, and the requirements of the state plan. Third, the status of workers in the enterprise changes, with the public side and the masses of employees combining to lead the enterprise. Therefore, the masses of employees adopt a sense of ownership towards the enterprise, and their labor enthusiasm and labor productivity are greatly improved. Fourth, capitalists and capitalist agents receive direct and regular leadership and education from the public side, as well as assistance and supervision from the masses of employees, so they can learn new things and new ideas in practice, gradually transform themselves, and correctly utilize their talents and positive roles. Fifth, in the distribution of profits, in addition to a small portion used to pay dividends and appropriately improve employee welfare, most of the enterprise's profits can be used to develop production according to the state plan.

It can be seen that after a private enterprise becomes a joint public-private operation, its nature has changed. That is, the ownership of the enterprise has changed. When a private enterprise has not yet become a joint public-private operation, the ownership of the enterprise belongs to the capitalists. After the joint operation, it becomes jointly owned by the state and the capitalists. Moreover, this joint venture is not an ordinary joint-stock enterprise, but an enterprise in which socialist components are in a leading position and capitalists are under the leadership of the public side. When a private enterprise has not yet been transformed into a joint public-private operation, the capitalist's corrupt management methods and the resulting chaotic wage and working hours systems have increasingly become a serious obstacle to production innovation; but after the joint operation, the interests of the workers are completely consistent with the interests of the public shares. Workers and state representatives stand together as the masters of the enterprise. Factories and enterprises gradually adopt socialist management methods. Workers actively participate in labor competitions and actively assist state representatives in improving business management, striving to complete and overfulfill the enterprise's production plan.

Joint public-private operation is the first step in changing capitalist ownership to ownership by the whole people. Every worker in a joint public-private enterprise must clearly recognize their position, clearly recognize that they are already the masters of the enterprise, and must establish a sense of responsibility and honor as masters. They must treat the state plan with practical actions to improve production and warmly undertake the task of transforming enterprises and transforming capitalists together with state representatives. This task is arduous. If anyone thinks that workers become the masters of the enterprise and forget the task of struggle, losing the direction of struggle, it is obviously wrong.

Many experiences have proven that when the masses of workers clearly understand the relationship between joint public-private operation and socialism, and truly realize that they are the masters of the enterprise, the wisdom and strength they exert are inexhaustible. Many factories reformed production management institutions and established and improved various necessary systems during the mobilization of the masses of workers to prepare for joint public-private operations. Many key issues that could not be resolved for a long time in the past have been successfully resolved after the joint operation. The Jiangnan Paper Mill had been losing money for many years, with a loss of 290 million yuan in the two months before the joint operation alone, while it made a profit of 740 million yuan in the two months after the joint operation.

Of course, when implementing joint public-private operation, it is also necessary to educate workers to respect the rights and interests of capitalists, and to educate workers to resolutely implement the enterprise's production plan, ensuring that the state's policies and laws are ensuring the future of socialism, which is also ensuring the interests of the working class. It is undeniable that there is still some labor-capital relationship in joint public-private enterprises, but this labor-capital relationship will be reflected through the public-private relationship, because worker representatives participate in production management, and the public share representatives of the enterprise are also representatives of the state. It is naturally not difficult to resolve all reasonable demands of workers; as for some workers who do not abide by labor discipline, disregard product quality, and make excessively high demands for welfare, it is necessary to conduct education and correction.

In joint public-private enterprises, workers have become the masters of the enterprise, which is an undeniable truth. We should clearly recognize this truth to educate workers and make all work adapt to the requirements after the joint operation, actively develop production, and gradually realize the task of transforming enterprises and transforming capitalists.

### 公私合营企业里的工人处在什么样的地位

    公私合营企业里的工人处在什么样的地位
    在公私合营企业里的工人究竟处在什么样的地位？到现在还有些人弄不清楚。不久以前，编辑部接到大成纺织染公司汪沛武同志来信询问这个问题，来信说：
    我们大成纺织染公司是江苏省第一批公私合营的企业。在合营工作中，我们曾对工人群众进行了“由于企业性质发生重大变化，工人成了企业主人”的教育，后来在总结工作时有人认为这种提法不够妥当：
    （一）容易模糊群众对企业性质的认识（到底不是社会主义性质的企业），从而模糊了斗争方向；
    （二）容易造成群众的思想错觉，而对资本家的合法权益不予尊重，因为合营企业中还有资本家的一份。
    但是，后来在华东公私合营座谈会上和上海解放日报所发表的一些有关的文章中却仍旧很明确地说明公私合营企业中的工人是“企业的主人”，并且一九五四年九月九日人民日报第二版上所登载的关于上海新安电机厂工人胡伟康的一篇新闻通讯，也标题为“成了企业主人以后”。因此，特地请问你们：到底应怎样提法才算正确？
    要了解公私合营里的工人处在什么样的地位，首先要了解合营企业从私营转到公私合营起了什么变化。李维汉同志在说明公私合营工业企业暂行条例时指出：当国家资本主义中级形式或者资本主义企业转变为公私合营的时候，企业的生产关系就要发生下列重要变化：一、企业由私有改变为公私共有，社会主义成分在企业内部同资本主义成分合作并且居于领导地位。在合营企业中私人股分的合法权益依然存在并且受到保护，但资本家处于公方领导之下，改变了他们在私营时期支配企业的地位。二、合营企业的经营管理不再采取资本主义的方式，而将逐步向国营企业看齐，完全以发展生产、保证需要和国家的计划要求为指导方针。三、工人在企业中的地位改变了，公方和职工群众结合一起居于企业的领导地位，因此，职工群众对待企业采取了主人翁的态度，劳动积极性和劳动生产率大大提高。四、资本家和资本家代理人得到公方直接、经常的领导和教育，得到职工群众的帮助和监督，因而有可能在实践中学习新事物和新思想，逐步改造自己，正确地发挥他们的才能和积极作用。五、在盈余分配上，企业利润除小部分用来发付股息红利和适当改善职工福利外，大部可以根据国家计划发展生产。
    由此可见，私营企业在公私合营以后，它的性质已发生了变化，即企业的所有权已经起了变化，当私营企业还没有公私合营的时候，企业的所有权是属于资本家的，在公私合营以后，就成为国家和资本家共同所有了，而且这种合营企业不是普通的合股企业，而是社会主义成分居于领导地位，资本家处于公方领导之下的地位的一种企业。当私营企业还没有转到公私合营的时候，资本主义腐朽的经营管理方式以及由此产生的工资制度和工时制度的混乱状态，已经日益成为生产革新的严重障碍；但在合营以后，工人的利益和公股的利益完全一致，工人和国家代表站在一起成了企业的主人，工厂企业逐渐采用社会主义管理方式，工人们积极参加劳动竞赛，积极协助国家代表改善经营管理，为完成和超额完成企业的生产计划而奋斗。
    公私合营是改变资本家所有制为全民所有制的第一个步骤，公私合营企业里的每个工人必须明确认识自己所处的地位，明确认识自己已经是企业的主人，必须树立主人翁的责任感和光荣感，并且要以搞好生产的实际行动对待国家计划，热忱地和国家代表一起共同担负起改造企业和改造资本家的任务。这个任务是艰巨的，如果有人以为工人当了企业的主人而忘记了斗争任务，迷失了斗争方向，显然是错误的。
    许多经验证明，当工人群众明白认识公私合营和社会主义的关系，真正体会到自己是企业的主人的时候，他们所发挥的智慧和力量是无穷无尽的。许多工厂在发动工人群众准备公私合营期间，改革了生产管理机构，建立和健全了各项必要的制度；许多工厂过去长期不能解决的关键问题，在合营以后都顺利解决了。江南造纸厂，多年以来，一直亏本，仅合营前两个月即亏本二亿九千万元，而合营以后两个月就盈余了七亿四千万元。
    当然，在实行公私合营的时候，也还要教育工人尊重资本家的权益，教育工人坚决执行企业生产计划，保障国家的政策、法令就是保障社会主义的前途，也就是保障工人阶级的利益。不可否认，在公私合营的企业里还有部分劳资关系存在，但是这种劳资关系将通过公私关系来体现，因为工人代表参加了生产管理，而企业的公股代表又是国家的代表，凡是工人的合理要求自然不难解决；至于某些工人不遵守劳动纪律，不顾产品质量以及过高要求生活福利等，是需要进行教育和纠正的。
    在公私合营的企业里工人已经成为企业的主人，这是确定不移的道理。我们应该清楚认识这个道理，来对工人进行教育，并使各项工作适应合营后的要求，积极发展生产，逐步实现改造企业和改造资本家的任务。
