To the Editor:

    The phenomenon of overtime work at the state-owned Taiyuan Iron Factory is extremely serious. In October of last year, overtime hours totaled over 800. In December of last year and January of this year, there were twelve instances of overtime, only two of which were approved by the factory director, agreed to by the trade union, and complied with the "Shanxi Province Provisional Measures for Restricting Overtime Work in Factories and Mines." The rest were in violation of regulations. Chen Xiaoxue, Wang Zhenkun, and others from the Capital Construction Department worked continuously for a month without a single day of rest, which the leadership euphemistically called "time off in lieu." Workers Sun Guoqing, Weng Zaijun, and Ding Changfa worked 131 hours of overtime. Afterwards, when they requested "time off in lieu," Lu Zengchen, the head of the Production Technology Section, said, "What's the rush? Whenever you need work, you'll have it. Whenever you need money, you'll have it." The Production Technology Section openly approved overtime slips with the words: "In order to overfulfill the production task, overtime is required." After the employees reported the situation to the Shanxi Daily and the Taiyuan Municipal Supervisory Committee, under the urging of the Municipal Bureau of Industry, the factory leadership conducted a relatively thorough written self-criticism in November of last year, formulated future measures, and expressed their intention to resolutely implement national policies, overcome capitalist management thinking and a one-sided focus on tasks, and eliminate overtime work. After this, the overtime situation improved somewhat. However, the problem still exists seriously. On the afternoon of December 18th, after work hours, Factory Director Wang personally took the initiative to suggest to Forging Workshop Foreman Ban Xideng that he arrange for overtime that night, saying that if they couldn't rivet the mine car wheels (for the Fujiatan Coal Mine) tonight, the machinists wouldn't be able to lathe them tomorrow, and the month's task wouldn't be completed. Upon hearing this, Ban Xideng had no choice but to call back six workers to work through the night, working continuously for twenty-one hours. Later, when the trade union learned about this, they asked him to make a self-criticism. Ban Xideng complained bitterly, saying, "I suffer at night, and then I get scolded during the day." Casters Yu Zhiting and Shi Yuqing worked overtime on the night of December 19th, working continuously for fifteen hours, and no one stopped them. Afterwards, when Safety and Sanitation Officer Liu Jinhai learned about it, he raised objections, but the head of the Production Technology Section said, "The leadership has its intentions. If there's a mistake, the leadership will be responsible."

    Why is the phenomenon of overtime work at the state-owned Taiyuan Iron Factory so serious? Objectively, there are certain difficulties due to the non-fixed products and uneven production; but mainly, the leading cadres have a one-sided view of tasks, do not conscientiously implement labor protection policies, and lack strict handling and effective measures afterward.

    太原铁工厂加班现象严重编辑同志：
    地方国营太原铁工厂加班加点的现象十分严重。去年十月份加班加点就有八百多小时。去年十二月和今年一月共加班加点十二次，其中只有两次是经过厂长批准、工会同意和符合“山西省限制工厂矿场加班加点暂行办法”的，其余都是违犯规定的。基本建设部门陈孝学、王振昆等连续工作一个月不能休息一天，领导方面美其名曰“调休”。工人孙国庆、翁在钧、丁昌发三人加班一百三十一小时，事后要求“调休”，生产技术科科长卢增辰说：“着急啥哩，到什么时候也有你的工，也有你的钱。”生产技术科竟公开在加班条上批着：“为了超额完成生产任务，加班加点。”职工将情况反映到山西日报和太原市监察委员会，在市工业局督促下，工厂领导方面才在去年十一月份进行了一次较深刻的书面检讨，并订出今后的措施，表示要坚决执行国家的政策，克服资本主义的经营思想和单纯任务观点，杜绝加班加点。此后，加班状况有了一些改进。但问题还是严重存在。十二月十八日下午下班后，王厂长亲自出马暗示锻工工段长班喜登晚上加班，说今晚铆不住翻车轮（富家滩煤矿的），明天机工就不能镟，这个月就完不成任务。班喜登听了，只得叫回六个工人漏夜干活，连续工作了二十一小时。后来，工会知道了这事，却要他做检讨。班喜登怨声载道地说，“晚上受了罪，白天还得受气。”铸工于志庭、石玉清两人在十二月十九日晚加班，连续工作十五小时，无人制止。事后安全卫生员刘金海知道了，就提出意见，生产技术科科长却说：“领导上有领导上的意图，错了有领导上负责。”
    地方国营太原铁工厂的加班加点现象为什么会这样严重呢？客观上因为产品不固定、生产不均衡，有着一定的困难；但主要是领导干部存有单纯任务观点，不认真贯彻保护劳动政策，事后又缺乏严格处理和有效措施。   任树章
