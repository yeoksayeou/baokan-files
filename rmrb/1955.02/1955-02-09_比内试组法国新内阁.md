Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 8th: Antoine Bidault, a leading figure of the French Independent Republican Party and former Prime Minister, agreed on the evening of the 6th to President Coty's designation to attempt to form a new cabinet. Bidault held preliminary consultations with various parties on the morning of the 7th, preparing to propose a list of cabinet members.

    According to the revised constitution, the full list of cabinet members must be presented to parliament during the authorization process. Under the current circumstances of infighting among right-wing parliamentary groups, this is not an easy task. However, according to the new provisions of the constitution, the National Assembly's passage of new authorization only requires a relative majority, no longer the absolute majority of three hundred and fourteen votes. This greatly aids the new Prime Minister who is tasked with forming the cabinet.

    Bidault himself is an entrepreneur, representing the interests of French industrial and commercial groups. Bidault's cabinet, from March to December 1952, was described by progressive French newspapers at the time as "the most reactionary government" since the liberation of France. This government was known for adopting anti-labor measures in the economy.

    Although Bidault abstained from voting on the Paris Accords in the National Assembly, he was a staunch supporter of the "European Defense Community" treaty. In a statement he made after consulting with the President this time, he did not express his attitude towards the Paris Accords, but he spoke of "strengthening France's alliance (with other countries)" and "building European unity," claims repeatedly promoted by previous predecessors who supported arming West Germany.

    Some newspapers believe that the resolution of the government crisis is bound to involve some general political difficulties, mainly the issue of ratifying the Paris Accords. Daniel Mayer (a Socialist member), chairman of the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee, admitted that the Paris Accords issue is the root cause of the current government crisis and will be the first problem anyone organizing a new government will encounter. He said: If the Paris Accords are given a second reading in the National Assembly, many members who previously voted to approve these accords are likely not to vote in favor again. French newspapers pointed out that because Bidault is a supporter of the "European Army," it will be difficult for him to defend the Paris Accords in the Council of the Republic.

    "Combat" wrote that any political leader who continues to pursue a policy of restoring German militarism will meet the same fate as Mendès-France.

### 比内试组法国新内阁

    比内试组法国新内阁
    【新华社八日讯】巴黎消息：法国独立共和党领袖人物、前总理安多瓦纳·比内六日晚间同意法国总统戈蒂的指定，试行组织新内阁。比内在七日上午同各方人士初步磋商，准备提出阁员名单。
    按照修改后的宪法，阁员全部名单必须在授权时向议会提出。在目前右翼议会党团勾心斗角的情况下，这不是一件容易的事情。但是，根据宪法新规定，国民议会通过新的授权，只要相对多数，而不再需要三百一十四票的绝对多数。这大大有助于受命组阁的新总理。
    比内本人是个企业家，他代表法国工商利益集团。从一九五二年三月到十二月的比内内阁被当时法国进步报纸称为法国解放以来“最反动的政府”。这个政府以采取经济上的反劳工措施而闻名。
    比内虽然在国民议会表决巴黎协定时弃权，但是他是“欧洲防务集团”条约的坚决拥护者。这次他在同总统会商后发表的声明中没有表示他对巴黎协定的态度，但是他谈到“加强法国（同别国的）联盟”、“建设欧洲统一”等历届拥护武装西德的前任一再宣扬的主张。
    有些报纸认为：政府危机的解决势必要牵涉到一些一般性的政治上的困难问题，主要是批准巴黎协定的问题。国民议会外交委员会主席丹尼埃·麦耶（社会党议员）承认：巴黎协定问题是目前政府危机的根源，同时将是任何组织新政府的人将要碰到的第一个问题。他说：假如巴黎协定在国民议会进行二读，曾经投票批准这些协定的许多议员很可能不会再投票赞成。法国报纸指出，由于比内是“欧洲军”的拥护者，因此他要在共和国参议院去为巴黎协定辩护是很困难的。
    “战斗报”写道：任何继续奉行恢复德国军国主义政策的政界领袖都将遭到同孟戴斯—弗朗斯一样的命运。
