    National Rural Savings Increase by Over Four Trillion Yuan
    [By this newspaper] Farmers in various regions are actively participating in savings after selling surplus grain and cotton. According to statistics from the Head Office of the People's Bank of China, from last autumn to the end of January this year, the national "Grain and Cotton Preferential Savings" amounted to 2,760 billion yuan, and the deposits transferred by credit cooperatives in various regions to the state bank amounted to 2,010 billion yuan, totaling 4,770 billion yuan. Sichuan, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and other places have overfulfilled the plan for carrying out "Grain and Cotton Preferential Savings." In many areas, such as Tangqiao Fenghuang Village in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, and Longhe Township in Lai'an County, Anhui Province, more than 70 percent of farm households selling surplus grain participated in savings. Many farmers, in order to support national economic construction and plan production funds systematically, deposited most of the money they earned from selling grain and cotton into state banks.
    With the arrival of the spring plowing season, the People's Banks in Hunan, Sichuan and other places have actively launched work to cash out deposits. The People's Bank of Hunan Province used methods such as entrusting credit cooperatives to handle cash withdrawals and sending people to the countryside to handle cash withdrawals, and paid out more than 300 billion yuan in "Grain and Cotton Preferential Savings" in early and mid-January. According to incomplete statistics, Sichuan, Jiangxi and other places paid out more than 300 billion yuan by mid-January.

    全国农村储蓄增加四万多亿元
    【本报讯】各地农民在出售余粮、棉花以后，积极参加储蓄。据中国人民银行总行统计，从去年秋后到今年一月底，全国“粮棉优待储蓄”款有二万七千六百多亿元，各地信用合作社转存到国家银行的存款有二万零一百多亿元，两项共计四万七千七百多亿元。四川、江西、山西、广东、浙江、江苏等地都超额完成了开展“粮棉优待储蓄”的计划。江苏省常熟县塘桥凤凰村、安徽省来安县龙河乡等许多地区，参加储蓄的农户占出售余粮户的百分之七十以上。许多农民为了支持国家经济建设和有计划地安排生产资金，把大部分出售粮、棉后得的钱存入了国家银行。
    随着春耕生产季节的到来，湖南、四川等地人民银行积极展开了兑付存款的工作。湖南省的人民银行用委托信用合作社代理兑付、背包下乡兑付等办法，在一月上旬和中旬兑付出“粮棉优待储蓄”款三百多亿元。据不完全统计，四川、江西等地到一月中旬就兑付出三千多亿元。
