Comrade Deputies!

You have given me the high honor and trust of appointing me Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR. Comrades, I thank you for the honor you have bestowed upon me, and I pledge that I will do everything in my power to live up to your trust. (Applause)

Let me talk about the main issues of the Council of Ministers' future work.

First of all, I should assure the Supreme Soviet that in all its activities, the Council of Ministers will continue to unswervingly implement the policies formulated by the Communist Party (applause), policies that are warmly supported by our people—the policy of building a communist society, further strengthening the power of the Soviet state, consolidating the alliance of the working class and the collective farmers, and consolidating peace and security. (Applause)

Implementing such a policy will guarantee the further prosperity of our socialist country and the further improvement of the people's welfare. And all the activities of the Communist Party and the Soviet government are subordinate to the lofty task of striving to improve the lives of the working people.

The basis for the further rise of our national economy has been and remains heavy industry, the output of which is now almost three and a half times greater than in the pre-war year of 1940.

Our highly developed heavy industry is a great historical achievement of the Communist Party and the Soviet people. As everyone knows, heavy industry has gloriously served the cause of building socialism and consolidating the independence of our motherland. Heavy industry is the foundation of the indestructible defense power of the Soviet Union and the power of our brave armed forces. Comrades, recall the severe years of the Great Patriotic War. If we had not had a strong economic base—heavy industry—we would not have been able to defeat the enemy armed to the teeth. Heavy industry guaranteed the freedom and independence of our motherland.

Heavy industry guarantees the development of all sectors of the national economy, such as agriculture, light industry, and the food industry, and is therefore a source of continuous improvement in the living standards of the Soviet people.

In order to advance agriculture, which supplies raw materials to light industry, it is necessary to provide agriculture with a sufficient number of tractors, combines, and other agricultural machinery. Only heavy industry can provide us with all of this.

In developing heavy industry, we have consistently followed and will continue to follow the instructions of the great Lenin and his faithful successor, J.V. Stalin. The Party defended the line of prioritizing the development of heavy industry in a sharp struggle against class enemies and their lackeys, and this line has been proven correct by the entire course of our socialist construction. This line is in line with the fundamental interests of the Soviet state and our people.

Therefore, in the economic field, the government will continue to resolutely implement the general line of striving to develop heavy industry as stipulated by the Communist Party. (Prolonged applause)

Implementing the measures formulated by the Communist Party for the development of socialist agriculture, in order to ensure that the growing needs of residents for food and industry for raw materials are met, will be a very important task for the government.

Therefore, the resolution of the recent plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is of great significance. This plenary session put forward the following task: to strive to achieve at least 10 billion poods of grain harvested annually and to increase the output of major livestock products by two to more than two times in the next five or six years.

The plenary session of the Central Committee pointed out the steps and methods to solve this nationwide task. Among these methods, in addition to increasing yield per unit area and reducing crop losses during harvesting, the most feasible and rapid method is to reclaim wasteland. By 1956, the sown area of reclaimed wasteland will reach at least 28 million to 30 million hectares. Expanding the planting area of corn in our country from 3.5 million hectares to 28 million hectares is also the greatest potential for grain production. Increasing grain production, especially increasing the production of high-yielding crops such as corn, can fundamentally solve the problem of establishing a feed base for animal husbandry. It is completely realistic and within our capabilities to complete such a magnificent agricultural task in five or six years for our country. However, in order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to mobilize the strength of collective farm members, the working class, and the entire Soviet people, and raise the level of agricultural production to a new and higher level on the basis of the latest technology and advanced working methods with high production efficiency that are perfectly mastered by our advanced agricultural producers.

News from all over the country shows that the working people in our cities and villages warmly support the resolution of the plenary session of the Central Committee and are determined to implement it. Party organizations and Soviet organs should lead the struggle to complete the nationwide task put forward by the plenary session of the Central Committee, and on their part, do everything possible to complete this task.

On the basis of further development of heavy industry and improvement of agriculture, we will expand the production of consumer goods—clothing, shoes, food, household items, and cultural equipment for residents.

We should pay special attention to further developing Soviet science, so that science is more closely integrated with solving the urgent tasks of communist construction, and further enhance the role of science in promoting technological progress and the rise of socialist culture.

The tasks in the national economy that I have mentioned above, as well as other important tasks, such as continuing to develop railways, waterways, and other types of transportation, expanding housing construction, striving to develop trade, and improving health care and developing national education, etc.—all these tasks will be specifically embodied in the Sixth Five-Year Plan. This plan should be formulated this year.

Comrade Deputies!

Our current task in leading the national economy is to complete the state plan for this year—the last year of the Fifth Five-Year Plan.

The 1955 National Economic Development State Plan stipulates that the total industrial output will increase by more than 9 percent compared to 1954. This year's industrial output will increase by 80 percent compared to 1950. This means that we will complete the industrial production task in this five-year plan ahead of schedule.

The production of heavy industry will be further expanded: during the five-year plan period, the products of heavy industry will increase by 84 percent. The volume of freight turnover in railways, highways, inland rivers, and maritime transport will increase compared to last year.

In agriculture, great efforts will be made this year to complete the resolution of the January Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party. The plan stipulates a significant increase in the production of grain, industrial raw material crops, potatoes, vegetables, meat, milk, eggs, wool, etc.

The 1955 plan stipulates an increase in the resources of agricultural raw materials, so as to ensure a further expansion of the production of consumer goods, the output of which will increase by 71 percent compared to 1950.

1955 will be a year of further improving the people's material welfare and cultural living standards. National income will increase by 10 percent compared to last year. The total wages of employees will increase, the income in kind and cash of farmers will increase, and housing construction will also be expanded.

To complete this year's National Economic Development Plan, it is necessary to maximize the mobilization and better utilization of existing internal economic potential, and requires intensive labor from all our people.

In completing the various tasks stipulated in the plan, further improving labor productivity is of utmost importance. Improving labor productivity is the most important factor in increasing the products of the national economy, reducing costs, and increasing accumulation. However, it should be frankly admitted that we have some serious shortcomings in this important undertaking. The improvement of labor productivity has been lagging behind the tasks of the Five-Year Plan.

Comrades, do not forget V.I. Lenin's instruction that labor productivity has a decisive significance in the construction of a new society. It should be noted that we can only expand the people's consumption to the extent that the labor productivity of the entire society improves.

Our country has done a lot of work in terms of technical equipment, reducing the labor of workers, and improving their professional skills. This work will continue in the future. It is necessary to improve the labor organization in production and ensure the completion and overfulfillment of the task of improving labor productivity stipulated in 1955, because this is the minimum task.

Solving the economic tasks we face depends, to a great extent, on the widespread adoption of advanced technology in various sectors of the national economy. Our achievements in technology are undeniable. Our country has taken a practical step in the peaceful use of atomic energy with the start of power generation by the first industrial atomic power station designed and built by Soviet scientists and engineers. As everyone knows, we are working to build some larger atomic power stations.

However, no matter how great our achievements in technological development are, there are still serious shortcomings in this regard in many sectors of the national economy. Many scientific research institutions and design institutions are still lagging behind in designing and formulating machines and production methods with high productivity that are compatible with modern international technology levels, and enterprises are lagging behind in mastering and promoting them in the national economy. This situation must be corrected. Ministries, scientific institutions, and engineering and technical personnel must improve their work in this area, so that our technological development accelerates year by year. Ministers and leaders of competent authorities must take this requirement as a major national task to be fulfilled responsibly.

The state's material reserves are one of the conditions for the smooth progress of economic construction. Reserves, this is our power, this is the strengthening of national defense. Therefore, it would be an unpardonable mistake to weaken attention to this extremely important matter or even to use state reserves to solve local, daily tasks. Increasing the state's reserves of raw materials, materials, fuel, industrial products, and food is our extremely important task.

The Party has consistently implemented a policy of comprehensively developing the economy and culture of all republics and regions participating in the great Soviet Union. Recently, some all-union ministries have been reorganized into union republic ministries. Therefore, a considerable number of enterprises originally under the jurisdiction of the all-union are now handed over to the management of the union republics. The Soviet organs and economic organs of the various union republics should utilize the new and more extensive potential to improve their leadership over economic construction and cultural construction.

In order to complete the 1955 annual state budget approved by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, all ministries, enterprises, construction sites, and economic organizations must practice thrift, pay constant attention to reducing costs, and ensure the completion of accumulation tasks.

We have a responsibility to strive to further streamline state organs, improve the work of state organs, eradicate bureaucracy and bureaucratic leadership methods, improve the level of organizational work, and enhance the sense of responsibility of all links for the affairs entrusted to them. A decisive condition for further improving the work of organs is to cultivate the sensitivity of all senior and junior leaders to fresh, advanced, and progressive things, widely adopt the initiatives of the working masses, and develop criticism and self-criticism as much as possible.

There are still many shortcomings in all aspects of our country's work, economic construction, and cultural construction. We must make great efforts to eradicate these shortcomings. The representatives who spoke here on the issue of the state budget made many correct criticisms of the ministries and competent authorities. The government is studying the speeches of the representatives and will take the necessary measures to eradicate the shortcomings they pointed out.

Comrade Deputies!

Comrade Molotov, the Soviet Foreign Minister, made a report to you yesterday. In his report, he made a correct analysis of the current international situation and described in great detail the Soviet government's foreign policy.

The unanimous support of the Soviet government's foreign policy by the representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union once again proves that this policy reflects the fundamental interests of our people. At the same time, this policy not only conforms to the wishes of our people, but also conforms to the wishes of the people of other countries in the world.

The strongest desire of the people of all countries in the world is nothing more than the desire for peace.

All the past and present activities of the Soviet government prove that the Soviet government has always supported peace and defended the cause of peace, and it has constantly made contributions to the cause of easing international tensions and strengthening normal relations with the people of all countries.

We establish relations with other countries based on the desire to promote the consolidation of peace and abide by the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. We advocate holding negotiations and reaching agreements with other countries in order to lead to the easing of international tensions. Of course, negotiations can only be successful if the other party participating in the negotiations also has the same desire. We believe that this is the only realistic path that can achieve good results in the current environment.

The Soviet government will continue to consistently implement the policy of consolidating peace and universal security, and the policy of maintaining friendly relations with the people of all countries, which has proven to be correct in practice.

The establishment of equal and mutually beneficial trade relations between the countries concerned will help to normalize the international situation and improve international relations. Every country should be free to sell what it can sell and buy what it needs from other countries without any discrimination.

As for our country, we are in favor of conducting extensive trade with all countries, regardless of their national and social systems. Everyone understands that there can be no normal relations between countries without trade that takes into account mutual interests. Expanding international trade and eliminating obstacles to cooperation in economic affairs can greatly promote the improvement of international relations.

We believe that there are healthy forces in capitalist countries who will surely find ways to improve international relations in order to maintain the peace and security of all peoples.

The Soviet Union is a peaceful country. It does not threaten anyone, nor is it prepared to invade anyone. We hope to develop political, economic, and cultural ties with any country, as long as they are also willing to develop such ties with the Soviet Union.

During the war against fascist Germany, there was close cooperation between the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain, and later France also joined this cooperation. As everyone knows, this cooperation produced positive results. This cooperation should have continued in the current period of peace. The situation has changed, and the fault does not lie with us. Now the US government intends to arrange relations with us not on the basis of mutual understanding, but on the basis of a "policy of strength." This policy is a dangerous policy, which will not lead to cooperation, but only to the deterioration of relations, will not lead to disarmament, but only to arms expansion, and contains the threat of a new war.

We cannot underestimate the United States' aggressive policy and their measures to plan to launch a new war. The United States and reactionary groups in countries subordinate to the United States are trying to revive German militarism and drag militarized West Germany into the aggressive military bloc of Western countries. The United States is also piecing together military blocs in Asia, organizing military provocations against the People's Republic of China, and interfering in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China.

The US government has embarked on a dangerous path of sharpening the situation in the Taiwan region. It is strengthening its military forces there—the navy and air force—and continuing to implement a policy of instigating war. The United States does not consider the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China, tramples on international agreements, and forcibly occupies Taiwan Island, which has always been an inseparable part of China's territory, turning it into a base for military provocations in the Far East.

The position taken by the United Nations on this issue cannot but be surprising. Until now, it has not condemned the US aggression against China, has not demanded that the United States immediately withdraw its armed forces from Taiwan, and has not restored the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China.

The Chinese government's policy on this issue has our full approval and support (applause). The People's Republic of China has gained the sympathy of the Soviet people and the entire progressive humanity because it is fighting for a just cause, for its own honor and independence. The Chinese people can count on the assistance of their loyal friend—the great Soviet people—in this noble cause. (Prolonged applause)

The United States of America continues to expand its network of military bases around peace-loving countries and is intensifying its arms expansion. At the same time, it is particularly focusing on the development of the air force and atomic weapons.

For a long time, the United States has been shrouded in an atmosphere of war hysteria. Political and military figures frequently make belligerent remarks and threats. Some of these people are so unscrupulous that they even openly demand the use of atomic weapons in launching wars against peace-loving countries.

Those madmen who are wielding atomic bombs must be awakened. This is the demand of the people, and the government of any country cannot but consider this. (Applause)

The policy of the aggressive forces of the capitalist camp cannot frighten our people. The aggressors presumably really think that the more they intimidate us, the more afraid we will be. We have heard many kinds of threats, but the Soviet people are not timid and afraid, and no one can scare them. (Prolonged applause)

Under these circumstances, the Soviet Union will continue to safeguard peace and strengthen its national defense. The Soviet government will continue to strengthen cooperation and brotherly friendship with the People's Republic of China and other people's democratic countries, strive to restore Germany's unification on the basis of peace and democracy, and expand and strengthen business contacts and cultural exchanges with those countries that maintain normal relations with the Soviet Union.

As for those short-sighted politicians who almost regard the Soviet Union's love of peace as a manifestation of our weakness, what is there to say about them? First of all, they should be reminded of the not-too-distant historical lessons, the fate of the Hitlerite aggressors. The fate of other adventurers who infringed on our motherland is also well known. All of these people have ended up with a disgraceful demise. (Applause) Our people have always been able to defend themselves and give a devastating counterattack to those who infringe on their freedom and independence.

It will still be the same in the future. (Prolonged applause)

As in the past, our task should be to firmly and unswervingly implement Vladimir Ilyich Lenin's teaching—to always be vigilant and protect our country's armed forces and defense power like the apple of our eye. (Stormy applause)

During the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet army showed its superiority over the enemy's army, and our equipment also surpassed the equipment of the German army, which was considered the best equipped in capitalist countries at that time.

In order to continue to maintain the Soviet Union's advantage over capitalist armies in terms of weapons, the Party Central Committee and the government have carried out tremendous work in the post-war period to equip our armed forces with new, fully modern weapons and military equipment, and have achieved great success. (Prolonged applause)

Now, we have a first-class, well-equipped, and highly combat-capable army, air force, and navy, who are always ready to complete any task assigned to them by the Communist Party and the Soviet government in ensuring the reliable security of our motherland. (Stormy applause)

Consolidating national defense power and maintaining the combat capability of our heroic armed forces at a level required by the interests of the motherland, the international situation, and modern military development will remain one of the main tasks of our Party and government. (Applause)

Comrade Deputies!

The powerful source of the Soviet state has always been the unbreakable unity of the people, the government, and the Communist Party, the spiritual and political solidarity of Soviet society, the friendship of our various nationalities, and the Soviet people's determination to work heroically for the socialist motherland.

There is no doubt that our working class, collective farmers, and people's intellectuals will continue to spare no effort to further enhance the power of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and achieve new achievements in communist construction! (Stormy, prolonged applause. All stand up)

### 在一九五五年二月九日苏联最高苏维埃会议上  苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的演说

专栏：

    在一九五五年二月九日苏联最高苏维埃会议上
    苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁的演说代表同志们！
    你们给了我崇高的荣誉和信任，任命我为苏联部长会议主席。同志们，我感谢你们给予我的荣誉，我提出保证，我将尽一切力量不辜负你们的信任。（掌声）
    让我谈一谈部长会议今后工作的主要问题。
    首先，我应当向最高苏维埃保证：部长会议在它的全部活动中，今后仍将坚持不移地执行共产党所制定的政策（掌声），为我国人民所热烈拥护的政策——建设共产主义社会、进一步加强苏维埃国家的威力、巩固工人阶级和集体农民的联盟的政策，巩固和平和安全的政策。（掌声）
    执行这样的政策，就可以保证我们社会主义国家的进一步繁荣和人民福利的进一步提高。而共产党和苏联政府的全部活动是服从于尽力改善劳动人民的生活这一崇高的任务的。
    我国国民经济进一步高涨的基础，过去是、现在仍然是重工业，目前重工业的产品差不多增加为战前一九四零年的三倍半。
    我们高度发达的重工业是共产党和苏联人民的伟大的历史成果。大家知道，重工业光荣地为建成社会主义和巩固我们祖国的独立的事业服务。重工业是苏联不可摧毁的国防力量和我们勇敢的武装力量的威力的基础。同志们，你们回想一下伟大的卫国战争的严重年代。当时如果我们没有强大的经济基础——重工业，我们就不能战胜武装到牙齿的敌人。重工业保障了我们祖国的自由和独立。
    重工业保证农业、轻工业和食品工业等国民经济各个部门的发展，因而是苏联人民生活福利不断提高的泉源。
    为了使供应轻工业原料的农业向前发展，必须要供给农业足够数量的拖拉机、联合机和其他农业机器。只有重工业能够供给我们这一切。
    在发展重工业方面，我们过去一贯遵循、而且今后仍将遵循着伟大的列宁和列宁事业的忠实继承者约·维·斯大林的指示。党在和阶级敌人以及他们的走狗进行尖锐的斗争中捍卫了优先发展重工业的路线，这个路线已为我国社会主义建设的整个过程证明是正确的。这个路线是符合苏维埃国家和我国人民的根本利益的。
    因此，政府在经济方面今后仍要坚决实行共产党规定的尽力发展重工业的总路线。（经久不息的掌声）
    实现共产党所制订的发展社会主义农业的措施，以便保证满足居民对食品和工业对原料的不断增长的需要，将是政府的一项十分重要的任务。
    因此，不久前举行的苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议的决议，具有巨大的意义。这次全体会议提出了下列任务：在最近五、六年内争取使每年收的粮食至少达到一百亿普特、并且使主要畜产品的产量增加为两倍到两倍以上。
    党中央委员会全体会议指出了解决这一全民任务的步骤和方法。在这些方法中，除去提高单位面积产量和降低收割时庄稼的损失外，最可行的而且最迅速的办法，就是开垦荒地。到一九五六年，开垦荒地的播种面积就至少要达到两千八百万到三千万公顷。使我国玉蜀黍的播种面积从三百五十万公顷扩大到两千八百万公顷，这也是生产谷物的最大的潜力。增产谷物，特别是增产像玉蜀黍这样高产量的作物，就可以根本解决建立畜牧业的饲料基础的问题。在五六年内完成如此宏伟的农业任务，对于我们国家说来，是完全现实的，而且是力所能及的。但是，为了达到这一目的，必须动员集体农庄庄员、工人阶级、苏联全体人民的力量，在最新技术和为我们先进农业生产者所完善地掌握的具有高度生产效能的先进工作方法的基础上，将农业生产水平提到新的、更高的水平。
    来自全国各地的消息说明，我国城乡劳动人民热烈拥护中央委员会全体会议的决议，并且决心实现这一决议。党组织和苏维埃机关应当领导争取完成中央委员会全体会议所提出的全民任务的斗争，并且在自己这方面，竭尽全力来完成这一任务。
    在进一步发展重工业和提高农业的基础上，我们将扩大消费品——衣服、鞋子、食品、家常用品和居民文化设备的生产。
    我们应当特别注意进一步发展苏联的科学，使科学更密切地同解决共产主义建设的迫切任务结合起来，进一步提高科学在促进技术进步和社会主义文化高涨中的作用。
    我上面所谈到的国民经济中的各项任务，以及其他一些重要任务，如继续发展铁路、水路和其他种类的运输，扩大住宅建设，尽力发展贸易，以及改进卫生事业和发展国民教育等——所有这些任务都将具体地体现在第六个五年计划内。这一计划应当在今年内制订出来。
    代表同志们！
    我们在领导国民经济方面的当前的任务是：完成今年——第五个五年计划的最后一年的国家计划。
    一九五五年发展国民经济国家计划规定工业总产量比一九五四年增加百分之九以上。今年的工业产量将比一九五○年增加百分之八十。这就是说，我们将提前完成这个五年计划中的工业生产任务。
    重工业的生产将进一步扩大：在五年计划期内，重工业的产品将增加百分之八十四。铁路、公路、内河、海洋运输的货物周转量将比去年增加。
    在农业方面，今年将大力进行工作，以完成党中央委员会一月全体会议的决议。计划规定大大增产谷物、工业原料作物、马铃薯、蔬菜、肉类、奶类、蛋类、羊毛等。
    一九五五年的计划规定增加农业原料的资源，这样就可以保证进一步扩大消费品的生产，它的产量将比一九五○年增加百分之七十一。
    一九五五年将是进一步提高人民的物质福利和文化生活水平的一年。国民收入将比去年增加百分之十。职工的工资总额将要增加，农民的实物和现款收入将要增多，同时住宅建设也将要扩大。
    要完成今年的国民经济发展计划，就需要最大限度地动员和更好地利用现有的内部经济潜力，需要我们全体人民进行紧张的劳动。
    在完成计划所规定的各项任务中，进一步提高劳动生产率具有极其重大的意义。劳动生产率的提高是增加国民经济产品、降低成本和增加积累的最重要的因素。但是，应该坦白地承认，在这个重要的事业中我们有一些严重的缺点。劳动生产率的提高一直落后于五年计划的任务。
    同志们，不要忘记弗·伊·列宁关于劳动生产率在新社会的建设中具有决定意义的指示。应该注意到，我们只能根据整个社会劳动生产率提高的程度来扩大人民的消费量。
    我们国家在技术装备、减轻劳动者的劳动和提高他们的业务水平方面做了许多工作。今后仍要进行这项工作。必须改善生产中的劳动组织和保证完成和超额完成一九五五年规定的提高劳动生产率的任务，因为这是最低限度的任务。
    解决我们面临的经济任务，在极大程度上取决于在国民经济各部门广泛采用先进技术。我们在技术方面获得的成就是无可反驳的。由于苏联科学家和工程师所设计和建成的第一座原子能工业电力站的开始发电，我们国家已在原子能的和平用途方面走了实际的一步。大家知道，我们正在努力建立一些规模更大的原子能电力站。
    但是，不管我们在技术发展方面所获得的成就多么大，然而在国民经济的许多部门中在这方面仍然存在严重的缺点。许多科学研究机关和设计机关在设计和制订具有高度生产率的、和现代国际技术水平相适应的机器和生产方法方面还是落后的，而企业则在掌握和向国民经济中推广它们这一点上还是落后的。必须纠正这样情况。各部、各科学机关和工程技术工作人员必须改进这方面的工作，使我国的技术发展一年比一年加快。主管机关的部长和领导人必须把这个要求作为重大的国家任务来负责完成。
    国家的物质储备是顺利进行经济建设的条件之一。储备，这就是我国的威力，这就是国防力量的加强。因此，如果减弱对这一极其重要的事情的注意或者竟将国家储备用于解决局部的、日常的任务，那将是不可饶恕的错误。增加国家的原料、物资、燃料、工业品和食品的储备，这是我们极其重要的任务。
    党一贯执行着使参加伟大的苏联的一切共和国和地区的经济和文化全面发展的政策。最近某些全联盟的部已改组为加盟共和国的部。因此，相当一部分企业原来隶属于全联盟，现在交给加盟共和国管理。各加盟共和国的苏维埃机关和经济机关应利用新的、更加广泛的潜力，以改进自己对经济建设和文化建设的领导。
    为了完成苏联最高苏维埃所批准的一九五五年度国家预算，各部、各企业、各建筑工地和各经济机构必须厉行节约、经常注意降低成本和保证完成积累任务。
    我们有责任争取进一步精简国家机关，改进国家机关的工作，根除文牍主义和官僚主义的领导方法，提高组织工作水平，提高各个环节对于委托给它们的事务的责任感。进一步改进机关工作的决定性条件就是：培养所有高级领导人员和下级领导人员对新鲜的、先进的和进步的事物的敏感，广泛地采用劳动群众的倡议，尽量地开展批评和自我批评。
    在我们国家工作、经济建设和文化建设各方面都还存在着许多缺点，为根除这些缺点，我们要作很大的努力。在这里就国家预算问题发言的代表们，对于各部和主管机关作了许多正确的批评。政府正在研究代表们的发言，并将采取必要的措施来根除他们所指出的缺点。
    代表同志们！
    苏联外交部长莫洛托夫同志昨天向你们作了报告。他在报告中对于当前的国际局势作了正确的分析，并且十分详尽地讲述了苏联政府的外交政策。
    苏联最高苏维埃代表们一致拥护苏联政府的外交政策，这又一次证明了这个政策反映了我国人民的根本利益。同时，这个政策不仅符合我国人民的愿望，而且也符合世界其他各国人民的愿望。
    世界各国人民最强烈的愿望，莫过于对和平的愿望。
    苏联政府过去和现在的全部活动都证明，苏联政府一直拥护和平和捍卫和平的事业，它为缓和国际紧张局势和加强同各国人民的正常关系的事业不断作出贡献。
    我们和其他国家建立关系，是本着促进巩固和平事业的愿望的，并遵守不干涉他国内政的原则。我们主张和其他国家举行谈判和达成协议，以导致国际紧张局势的缓和。当然，只有参加谈判的另一方也抱有同样的愿望，谈判才有可能成功。我们认为，这是在当前环境下能够取得良好结果的唯一现实的道路。
    苏联政府今后仍将一贯地执行在实践中证明正确的、巩固和平和普遍安全的政策，执行和各国人民保持友好关系的政策。
    有关国家之间建立平等互利的贸易关系将有助于国际局势的正常化和国际关系的改善。每个国家应该可以自由地出售它所能够出售的东西，向其他国家购买它所需要的东西而不受到任何歧视。
    至于谈到我们的国家，我们赞成同一切国家，不管它们的国家制度和社会制度如何，进行广泛的贸易。每个人都明白，如果缺少照顾到相互利益的贸易，就不可能有国家同国家之间的正常关系。扩大国际贸易和消除经济事务合作的障碍，就可以大大促进国际关系的改善。
    我们相信，在资本主义国家中有着健康的力量，他们一定会为了维持各国人民的和平和安全而找到改善国际关系的方法。
    苏联是和平的国家。它不威胁任何人，也不准备侵犯谁。我们希望同任何国家发展政治、经济和文化联系，只要它们也愿意同苏联发展这种联系。
    在对法西斯德国作战期间，苏联、美国和英国之间曾经有过密切的合作，后来法国也参加了这种合作。大家知道，这种合作产生了积极的结果。这种合作在目前的和平时期中，本来应该还可以继续下去。局面改变了，过错不在我们身上。现在美国政府不是打算在互相谅解的基础上，而是打算在“实力政策”的基础上来安排同我们的关系。这种政策是危险的政策，它不会导向合作，只会导向关系恶化，不会导向裁减军备，只会导向扩充军备，并且包藏着爆发新战争的威胁。
    我们不能对美国的侵略政策和他们策划发动新战争的措施估计不足。美国和从属于美国的国家中的反动集团在力图复活德国军国主义，并要把军国主义化的西德拖入侵略性的西方国家军事集团。美国也还在亚洲拼凑军事集团，对中华人民共和国组织军事挑衅，并且在干涉中华人民共和国的内政。
    美国政府走上了促使台湾地区局势尖锐化的危险道路。它在那里加强自己的军事力量——海军和空军，继续执行挑拨战争的政策。美国不考虑中华人民共和国的合法权利，践踏国际协定，强占了历来就是中国不可分割的一部分领土的台湾岛，把它变成了在远东实行军事挑衅的基地。
    联合国在这个问题上所采取的立场是不能不令人惊奇的。它直到现在还没有谴责美国对中国的侵略行动，没有要求美国立即将它的武装部队撤出台湾以及恢复中华人民共和国的合法权利。
    中国政府对这个问题的政策得到我们的完全赞同和支持（掌声）。中华人民共和国之所以获得苏联人民和整个进步人类的同情，是因为它在为正义事业，为自己的荣誉和独立而进行斗争。中国人民可以指望他们这一崇高事业得到自己的忠实朋友——伟大的苏联人民的援助。（经久不息的掌声）
    美利坚合众国继续在爱好和平的国家四周扩大自己的军事基地网，并在加紧扩充军备。同时，特别着重发展空军和原子武器。
    很久以来美国国内就笼罩着战争歇斯底里的气氛。政界和军界人士经常发表好战的言论和威胁。其中某些人士竟如此肆无忌惮，甚至公开要求在对爱好和平的国家发动战争时使用原子武器。
    必须叫那些挥动原子弹的狂人清醒过来。这是人民的要求，任何一个国家的政府都是不能不考虑这一点的。（掌声）
    资本主义阵营侵略势力的政策是不能使我国人民惊惶失措的。侵略者谅必当真认为，他们越是恫吓我们，我们就越加害怕。我们已经听到了许多形形色色的威胁，但是苏联人民不是胆小怕事的，任何人都是吓不倒他们的。（经久不息的掌声）
    在这种情况下，苏联今后仍要守卫和平和加强自己的国防力量。苏联政府今后要加强同中华人民共和国以及同其他人民民主国家的合作和兄弟般的友谊，要争取在和平、民主的基础上恢复德国的统一，要扩大和加强同那些与苏联保持有正常关系的国家的事务联系和文化交流。
    至于把苏联的爱好和平几乎看成是我们软弱的表现的那些目光短浅的政治家们，关于他们说些什么好呢？首先应该提醒他们记住为时还不久的历史教训，希特勒侵略者的下场。其他一些侵犯我们祖国的冒险分子的结局如何，也是人所共知的。所有这些人都落得个可耻的灭亡。（掌声）我国人民从来就能够保卫自己并给侵犯他们的自由和独立的人以毁灭性的反击。
    今后还将是这样。（经久不息的掌声）
    和过去一样，我们的任务应该是坚定不移地、不屈不挠地贯彻弗拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁的遗训——要永远保持警惕，保护我们国家的武装部队和国防力量就像保护眼珠一样。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    在伟大卫国战争期间，苏联军队显示了它超过敌人的军队的优越性，而我们的装备也超过当时被认为是资本主义国家中装备最好的德国军队的装备。
    为了继续保持苏联在武器方面已经取得的对资本主义军队的优势，在战后时期内，党中央委员会和政府进行了巨大的工作，以新式的、完全现代化的武器和军事装备来装配我们的武装力量，并且取得了巨大的成就。（经久不息的掌声）
    现在，我们拥有头等的、装备优良、具有高度作战能力的陆军、空军和海军，他们时刻准备完成共产党和苏联政府所交给的在保障我们祖国的可靠的安全方面的任何任务。（暴风雨般的掌声）
    巩固国防力量，把我们的英勇的武装部队的作战能力保持在祖国的利益、国际局势和现代军事发展所要求的水平上，这些将仍然是我们党和政府的主要工作之一。（掌声）
    代表同志们！
    苏维埃国家力量的强大源泉一直是人民、政府和共产党的牢不可破的统一、苏联社会的精神上和政治上的团结一致、我们各族人民的友谊、和苏联人民为社会主义祖国而英勇劳动的决心。
    毫无疑问，我国的工人阶级、集体农民和人民知识分子今后将仍然不惜一切力量来进一步提高苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的威力，在共产主义建设中取得新的成就！（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声。全体起立）
