Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 5th: According to TASS, the Soviet Supreme Soviet's Council of the Union continued its meeting on the morning of February 4th, beginning discussions on the report by Soviet Finance Minister Zverev regarding the 1955 Soviet national budget and the execution of the 1953 national budget.

    Prior to the discussion, the deputies heard a supplementary report from the Budget Committee of the Council of the Union. Speakers in the discussion pointed out that the new budget reflects the vigorous creative power of the Soviet people and the strengthening of the Soviet state's power. The new budget guarantees the further development of heavy industry and the continuous improvement of the material welfare of the working people. They all advocated approving the 1955 Soviet national budget.

    Many deputies spoke about the achievements their respective republics had made in the economic and cultural fields.

    Kazakh Deputy L. Brezhnev spoke about Kazakhstan's large-scale land reclamation work and future plans. He said that this year, Kazakhstan's planting area will almost double. In one year, the planting area for grains alone will triple that of 1953. This year, 250 giant state-owned grain farms will be established on the newly reclaimed land.

    G.L. Gretchukha, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian Republic, described the development of Ukrainian industry. He said that in the past four years, the republic's coal production has almost increased by 50 percent. Last year, pig iron production was 60 percent higher than in 1950, and steel was 83 percent higher. The production of various textiles and other consumer goods is now several times higher than at the beginning of the Fifth Five-Year Plan.

    Belarusian Representative Kozlov, in his speech, pointed out the important significance of the resolution "On Increasing the Production of Animal Husbandry Products" recently adopted by the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He also pointed out that the Belarusian Republic is prepared to vigorously expand the planting of fodder crops, further mechanize fodder preparation, and build many new livestock farms on a larger scale.

    Representatives from the Russian Federation, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan also spoke in the discussion. While pointing out the achievements in economic and cultural development, they also criticized shortcomings in the work of the Soviet Ministry of Finance and some other ministries.

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 5th: According to TASS, the Soviet Supreme Soviet's Council of Nationalities met on the afternoon of February 4th to discuss the report by Soviet Finance Minister Zverev on the 1955 Soviet national budget.

    Before the discussion, the meeting first heard a supplementary report from the Budget Committee of the Council of Nationalities. It suggested that the revenue part of the budget should be increased somewhat, and the amount of appropriations for certain economic and cultural facilities should be revised. It recommended approving the 1955 Soviet national budget as amended by the Budget Committee.

    Deputies warmly supported the 1955 national budget in their speeches. They pointed out the peaceful nature of Soviet national economic construction reflected in the new budget, as well as the economic and cultural construction achievements of their respective republics.

    Lithuanian Deputy Gedvilas said that the figures in this year's national budget vividly demonstrate that Soviet industry and agriculture are constantly improving, and the Soviet state is advancing by leaps and bounds. Lithuania has established a strong industry in the fifteen years since the establishment of Soviet power. Last year's total industrial output increased to more than twice that of 1950. The planting area has also been greatly expanded. Culture with a national form and socialist content is also developing vigorously. In 1954 alone, about one hundred schools were opened.

    Tajik Representative Rasulov said: Tajikistan's investment in the national economy in the past four years has increased approximately threefold. Last year, Tajikistan's main crop, cotton, averaged 28.5 quintals per hectare (equivalent to 380 jin per mu). Now, Tajikistan ranks first in the Soviet Union in terms of cotton yield per unit area.

    Belarusian Representative Afshimovich, after talking about Belarus's economic construction achievements, pointed out: Every year, the Belarusian budget allocates a large amount of funds to national education, healthcare, and housing construction. After the Great Patriotic War, the state built residential buildings with an area of approximately 3.5 million square meters in various cities and workers' residential areas, and 517,000 residential buildings have been built in rural areas.

    Representatives from some other union republics also spoke at the meeting. They also agreed to approve the Soviet national budget. In addition, they also put forward many concrete suggestions on overcoming shortcomings in the leadership of various sectors of the national economy.

    苏联最高苏维埃两院讨论苏联国家预算
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃联盟院四日上午继续举行会议，开始讨论苏联财政部长兹维列夫关于一九五五年度苏联国家预算和一九五三年度国家预算执行情况的报告。
    在讨论前，代表们听取了联盟院预算委员会的副报告。在讨论中发言的人指出，新预算案反映了苏联人民创造力量的旺盛和苏维埃国家力量的增强。新预算保证着重工业的进一步发展和劳动人民物质福利的不断提高。他们都主张批准一九五五年度苏联国家预算。
    许多代表在发言中谈到了自己的共和国在经济和文化方面所获得的成就。
    哈萨克代表列·布列日涅夫谈到了哈萨克大规模的开垦工作和今后的计划。他说，今年哈萨克的播种面积几乎要增为两倍。一年以后单是谷物的播种面积就将增为一九五三年的三倍。今年，新开垦的土地上将建立二百五十个巨型谷物国营农场。
    乌克兰共和国部长会议副主席格列楚哈叙述了乌克兰工业发展的情况。他说，最近四年来，共和国的采煤量几乎增加了百分之五十。去年的铣铁产量比一九五零年多百分之六十，钢多百分之八十三。现在各种织品和其他消费品的生产量比第五个五年计划开始时要多好几倍。
    白俄罗斯共和国代表科兹洛夫在发言中指出了苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议最近通过的“关于增加畜牧业产品生产”的决议的重要意义。他还指出，白俄罗斯共和国准备大力扩大饲料作物的播种，更大规模地使饲料的调制工作机械化，建筑许多新的养畜场。
    在讨论中发言的还有俄罗斯联邦、格鲁吉亚、吉尔吉斯和土库曼等加盟共和国的代表。他们在指出经济和文化发展的成就的同时，也批评了苏联财政部和其他一些部的工作缺点。
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃民族院在二月四日下午开会，讨论苏联财政部长兹维列夫关于一九五五年度苏联国家预算的报告。
    会议在讨论前首先听取了民族院预算委员会的副报告。他建议预算的收入部分应作一些增加，并且修改对经济和文化事业某些设施的拨款的数量。他建议批准经预算委员会提出修正的苏联一九五五年度国家预算。

    立陶宛代表吉德维拉斯说，今年度国家预算的数字生动地证明，苏联的工业和农业在不断地提高，苏维埃国家在大踏步地前进。立陶宛在苏维埃政权建立以来的十五年中，已经建立起了强大的工业。去年的工业总产量增加为一九五○年的两倍以上。播种面积也大为扩大了。民族形式、社会主义内容的文化也在日益蓬勃地发展。单在一九五四年就开设了约一百所学校。
    塔吉克代表拉苏洛夫说：塔吉克最近四年中国民经济的投资额约增加为三倍。去年塔吉克的主要农作物棉花平均每公顷收二十八点五公担（合每亩三百八十市斤）。现在，塔吉克在棉花单位面积产量上已经占苏联第一位。
    白俄罗斯代表阿夫希莫维奇在谈到了白俄罗斯的经济建设成就之后指出：每年白俄罗斯的预算对国民教育、保健事业、住宅建设都拨出了大量的经费。卫国战争结束后，国家在各城市和工人住宅区建造了面积约达三百五十万平方公尺的住宅，农村地区已经建造了五十一万七千幢住宅。
