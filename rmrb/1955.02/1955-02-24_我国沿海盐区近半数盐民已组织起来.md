Nearly Half of Salt Farmers in China's Coastal Salt Regions Have Been Organized

The mutual aid and cooperation movement in China's coastal salt regions is developing rapidly. In Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, Shandong, Guangdong, Guangxi and other six coastal provinces, according to incomplete statistics, by the end of last year, the number of salt farmers organized accounted for more than 47% of the total number of salt farmer households in these regions. In the coastal salt regions of Zhejiang Province, by the end of last year, the number of salt production cooperatives had grown to 94, and mutual aid teams had grown to 2,426, with participating salt farmers accounting for more than 67% of the total number of salt farmer households in Zhejiang. In the coastal salt regions of Fujian, by the end of November last year, the number of organized salt farmers had reached more than 68%. In Shandong, salt farmers in many sea salt fields have been completely organized. In Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, due to the late start of the mutual aid and cooperation movement (started only in April last year), by the end of November last year, less than one-fifth of the salt farmers had been organized. However, the Guangdong and Guangxi Salt Affairs Administration, on the basis of state-managed salt fields, helped salt farmers organize three fully socialist salt production cooperatives last year.

After the individual salt farmers in the above-mentioned areas were organized, their output increased significantly. Taking August of last year as an example, the output of the Si Min Salt Production Cooperative in Huiyang County, Guangdong, increased by 34.8% compared with the output of local individual salt farmers. In the Shandong sea salt producing area, in the past year, the salt output of salt production cooperatives increased by about 10% compared with individual salt farmers; the salt output of mutual aid teams increased by more than 5% compared with individual salt farmers. Many salt farmers who were also part-time farmers have also solved the contradiction that they could not take care of both agriculture and salt production during the busy farming season after being organized. At the same time, the quality of salt has also improved after being organized. Last year, the output of first-class salt from general mutual aid teams in the Shandong sea salt area was 5% to 10% higher than that of individual salt farmers.

With the increase in production, the income of organized salt farmers has also increased.

    我国沿海盐区近半数盐民已组织起来
    我国沿海盐区互助合作运动发展很快。浙江、江苏、福建、山东、广东、广西等六省沿海盐区，据不完全统计，到去年年底止，组织起来的盐民已占到这些地区盐民总户数的百分之四十七以上。浙江省沿海盐区到去年年底，盐业生产合作社已发展到九十四个，互助组发展到二千四百二十六个，参加的盐民占到浙江盐民总户数的百分之六十七以上。福建沿海盐区到去年十一月底，组织起来的盐民就达到了百分之六十八强。山东有很多海盐盐场的盐民已完全组织起来。广东、广西两省由于互助合作运动开展较迟（去年四月才开始），到去年十一月底止，组织起来的盐民还不到五分之一。但是两广盐务管理局在国家代管盐田的基础上，去年已帮助盐民组织了三个完全社会主义性质的盐业生产合作社。
    上面这些地区个体盐民组织起来以后，产量有了显著的增加。以去年八月间为例，广东惠阳县四民盐业生产合作社的产量就比当地个体盐民的产量增加了百分之三十四点八。山东海盐产区在去年一年中，盐业生产合作社的盐产量比个体盐民增加百分之十左右；互助组的盐产量比个体盐民增加百分之五以上。有许多半盐半农的盐民在组织起来以后，也解决了农忙季节不能兼顾农业和盐业生产的矛盾。同时在组织起来以后，盐的质量也有了提高。去年，山东海盐区一般互助组的一等盐的产量，比个体盐民要多百分之五到百分之十。
    随着生产的提高，组织起来的盐民收入也有了增加。
