    "The Soviet Army and Navy are reliably defending the peaceful labor, freedom, and happiness of the Soviet people, the creators and builders of communist society. The Chinese people and their armed forces, together with the Soviet armed forces, are fighting for peace, for the defense of the achievements of the people's revolution and socialist construction.
    "Faithful to the policy of peace, the Soviet Union has always unswervingly and persistently striven to ease international tensions, to cooperate and develop business relations between countries, and to establish a collective security system."

He said: "The powerful Soviet Army, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and with the support of the entire Soviet people, has gloriously carried out and is carrying out the sacred duty of defending its motherland. Our army will take the great Soviet Army as an example and build itself into a modern army to defend our socialist construction and defend peace in Asia and the world."
    He further pointed out: "The American imperialists are plotting new wars, organizing aggressive blocs everywhere, and establishing military bases, especially recently carrying out serious war provocations against the Chinese people in the Taiwan area of our country. But these warmongers should not forget that the powerful and invincible Soviet Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army stand solemnly on the road of their planned new war. If the aggressors dare to launch a new war, China and the Soviet Union will join hands and give the aggressors a devastating blow! The victorious 600 million Chinese people and their armed forces—the Chinese People's Liberation Army—will certainly liberate our territory Taiwan. We have the confidence and the strength to accomplish this task."
    The reception proceeded in a warm and friendly atmosphere.
