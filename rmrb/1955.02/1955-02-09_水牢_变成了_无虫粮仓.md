    "Water Dungeon" Transformed into "Insect-Free Granary"
    Recently, Hunan Province saw the emergence of a large "insect-free granary." This granary is the Shijingwan Warehouse in Changsha City. During the Qing Dynasty, it was a "water dungeon" for imprisoning criminals; the Kuomintang reactionaries once used it as an "Army Prison Office"; later, it was changed to a "community granary" for officials to hoard grain they had plundered. After liberation, although the warehouse was cleaned several times, it was not thorough enough. In June of last year, the employees of this granary studied the experience of Yu Hang County, Zhejiang Province, in creating "insect-free granaries." Over the past six months, after the employees thoroughly cleaned up, eradicated warehouse insects, and regularly maintained cleanliness and hygiene, this granary has now become an "insect-free granary" capable of storing three million jin of grain.
    In order to promote the experience of this granary, the Changsha City Grain Bureau held an "Insect-Free Granary" exhibition in mid-January. After visiting, the director of the Second Warehouse of the Changsha City Grain Bureau and others expressed their determination to learn from the Shijingwan Warehouse. After visiting this granary, Soviet grain expert Ardamonova also gave it a very high evaluation.

### “水牢”变成了“无虫粮仓”

    “水牢”变成了“无虫粮仓”
    湖南省最近出现了一座大的“无虫粮仓”。这个粮仓是长沙市师敬湾仓库。清朝的时候，这里是一座监禁犯人的“水牢”；国民党反动派曾经用来作“陆军监狱署”；后来又改为“社仓”，为官僚们囤放搜刮来的粮食。解放以后，这座仓库虽然经过几次清扫，但都不够彻底。去年六月间，这个粮库的职工学习了浙江省余杭县创造“无虫粮仓”的经验。半年多来，经过职工们彻底扫除，扑杀仓虫，并经常保持清洁卫生，现在这座粮库已经成为一座能够容纳三百万斤粮食的“无虫粮仓”。
    长沙市粮食管理局为了推广这个粮库的经验，在一月中旬举办了一次“无虫粮仓”展览会。长沙市粮食管理局第二仓库主任等参观以后，都表示要坚决向师敬湾仓库学习。苏联粮食专家阿尔达毛诺娃参观这座粮库以后，也作了很高的评价。
