    A Construction Site Supply Station

    Next to the Hanshui Highway Bridge construction site, there's a shed made of reed mats. This is the construction site supply station that workers love.

    When this supply station was first established in November of last year, there was only one female salesperson, Liu Jing. Every day, she would bring a box to the construction site canteen to sell goods. Because the person in charge of the cooperative directly leading the supply station at the time did not value the supply of materials to basic construction sites, Liu Jing's box was filled with either rotten oranges or "Da Qianmen" and "Hongjin" cigarettes, which workers didn't often smoke. At that time, the workers were working diligently on the Hanshui River, braving temperatures of minus ten-odd degrees Celsius. They urgently needed cotton hats with earflaps, but the supply station didn't have them; they needed cotton gloves, but the supply station didn't have them; they needed face cream and galoshes, but they also didn't have them. The workers gave it a name – "The Junk Stall."

    In January of this year, the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party repeatedly instructed relevant departments to support basic construction. The Yangtze Daily also criticized the phenomenon of not valuing the supply of materials to basic construction sites. This "Junk Stall" then began to change.

    Now, it's become a proper supply station. Four shelves and five glass counters display a wide variety of food and general merchandise. Sixteen glass jars filled with candy are also placed on the glass counters. Originally, the supply station only had twenty-odd kinds of goods; now, general merchandise alone numbers over a hundred, and non-staple foods number over two hundred. The district cooperative leading the supply station also said: "If rotten oranges or poor-quality goods are discovered again, return them immediately. Supply what the construction site needs, and give priority to supplying items that are in short supply to the construction site."

    People who come to the Hanshui Highway Bridge construction site can see that the salespersons are always mindful of the workers' needs. Once, the workers needed cured meat, and the supply station quickly called the district cooperative to allocate 300 jin. In less than twenty minutes, the district cooperative delivered it. During the Spring Festival, the supply station provided workers with large quantities of pork, chicken, fresh fish, sausage, New Year cake, and other items. Zhou Quanfu, a worker in the power distribution room of the electromechanical work zone, was stuck on duty and couldn't leave, so the supply station delivered the cigarettes and New Year cake he needed to him. Workers like Guo Qingfeng and Guo Wencan wanted to buy yarn to knit sweaters, so the salesperson Liu Jing repeatedly ran to the Wusheng Road Cooperative store to buy it for them. After buying it, she also found someone to knit the sweaters for the workers and brought the sweaters back to them. During the busiest time of business during the Spring Festival, the salespersons often worked from 7:00 in the morning until late at night; sometimes until 4:00 the next morning, they were still busy selecting goods for the workers. The workers generally reflected: "The supply station is truly serving us workers!"

    The good reputation of the supply station has slowly spread. Workers and their family members living at the Hanyang construction site often take small boats to this supply station to buy things; workers with homes in Jiang'an also buy their favorite things here and take them back. The supply station originally only sold tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of yuan a day; now, it sells a total of one to two million yuan a day. On January 20th, sales reached more than 17 million yuan.

    No matter how tired they are, the salespersons are always full of enthusiasm. They say: Although we don't operate machines, by doing a good job in supplying the workers, we are also participating in the socialist construction of the motherland!

    一个工地上的物资供应站
   张碨
    在汉水公路桥工地的旁边，有一间用芦席盖成的棚子，这里是一个受到工人们热爱的工地物资供应站。
    去年十一月间，这个物资供应站刚设立的时候，只有女营业员刘静一个人，每天带个箱子到工地食堂卖货。由于当时直接领导这个供应站的合作社的负责人不重视基本建设工地物资供应工作，刘静的箱子里装的货，不是烂橘子，就是工人们不常吸的“大前门”、“红金”香烟。那时候，工人们正在汉水上冒着零下十几度的严寒辛勤地劳动。他们迫切需要带耳朵的棉帽子，供应站没有；需要棉手套，供应站没有；需要擦脸油和胶鞋，也没有。工人们给它送了个名字——“破烂摊”。
    今年一月间，中共武汉市委多次指示要有关部门支援基本建设。长江日报也曾批评了不重视基本建设工地物资供应工作的现象。这个“破烂摊”便开始变样了。
    现在，这里已经是一个像样的供应站了。四个货架和五个玻璃货柜中，陈列了多种多样的食品、百货，玻璃柜上还摆着十六个满装糖果的玻璃瓶。原来供应站只有二十来种货，现在光百货就有一百多种，副食品有二百多种。领导这个供应站的区合作社还说：“如再发现有烂橘子和质量不好的货，马上退回来。工地需要什么，供应什么，不够供应的物品，也先尽工地供应。”
    到汉水公路桥工地来的人们，可以看到营业员们随时都在留心工人们的需要。有一次，工人需要腊肉，供应站很快就打电话要求区社拨三百斤来；不到二十分钟，区社就给送到了。春节期间，供应站供给工人大量猪肉、鸡、鲜鱼、香肠、年糕等物品。机电工区配电室工人周全福一个人值班离不开，供应站就把他需要的纸烟和年糕等送到他跟前。郭庆丰、郭文灿等工人要买毛线打毛衣穿，营业员刘静就一次一次地跑到武圣路合作社门市部替他们买。买好以后，她还替工人们找人代织，并把毛衣拿回来交给他们。在春节营业最繁忙的时候，营业员们往往从早上七点钟，一直工作到深夜；有时候到第二天早上四点钟，他们还在张罗着给工人们挑选货物。工人们普遍反映：“供应站真是为我们工人服务的！”
    供应站的好名声，慢慢传开了。住在汉阳工地的工人和工人家属，也常常坐着小划子到这个供应站买东西；家在江岸的工人，也从这里买着心爱的东西拿回去。供应站原来一天只卖几万元，几十万元，现在一天总卖一、二百万元，一月二十日那天，卖到了一千七百多万元。
    不管多么劳累，营业员们总是热情充沛。他们说：我们虽然不搬弄机器，可是我们作好了对工人的供应工作，也就是参加了祖国的社会主义建设事业！
