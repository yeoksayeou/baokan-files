    Labor Models Should Keep Moving Forward
    By our reporter Zhu Bo

    Statistics from enterprises under the Beijing Municipal Railway, Postal and Telecommunications, Printing, Textile, Machinery, and Local Industry Bureaus show that in 1953 there were 270 municipal labor models. Among them, 169 were re-elected as labor models in 1954, 36 were not eligible for re-election due to transfer to study, work, or long-term illness and recuperation, and 65 were not re-elected. The number of labor models who were not re-elected accounted for about one-quarter of the total number of labor models. Compared with the previous year, the proportion of labor models not re-elected has decreased significantly, which is progress. However, the fact that one-quarter of them were not re-elected is still a problem worth noting.
    According to the investigation, the following are the main reasons for the non-reelection of this quarter of labor models:
    First, they themselves have developed feelings of pride and complacency, satisfied with their existing achievements, not seeking progress, and not humbly listening to the opinions of the masses, to the point of becoming detached from the masses. A young model from the 7th Branch of the Beijing Post Office was very serious and responsible in his work before being elected as a labor model. He once braved wind and rain to go deep into various construction sites in the suburbs to carry out business, often working until midnight before returning. When he heard that someone had created advanced experiences, he took the initiative to learn and promote them within the bureau, which played a significant role in promoting the bureau's business work. However, after being elected as a labor model, he became arrogant and his sense of responsibility towards work weakened. As a result, he made seven mistakes last year. Moreover, after making mistakes, he refused to humbly accept the criticism of the masses, arguing with them in order to shirk responsibility. The Party Committee Secretary and the Chairman of the Labor Union of the Post Office repeatedly educated him, asking him to correct his complacency, but he turned a deaf ear to the leadership's education. Therefore, he finally failed to be re-elected in last year's model selection. There are also some labor models who are unwilling to learn from the advanced experiences created by the masses, fearing that it would lower their status, and as a result, they have fallen behind.
    Second, some labor models have not been re-elected because they have serious technical conservatism. A labor model from the Tram Company, who is the leader of the track welding team, has been unwilling to teach welding techniques to the young workers in the team. When the quality of his welding is not good, he puts the blame on others, which has aroused great dissatisfaction among the workers in the team. A labor model from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has rich experience in manufacturing welding rods, but refuses to make this experience public. The leadership has tried to persuade and mobilize him several times, but his ideological problem has not been resolved.
    Third, some labor models have not been re-elected because the Party, government, labor union, and youth league organizations in factories and mines have not provided them with enough education and assistance, so they cannot solve problems in their work in a timely manner, and therefore have not made any new achievements in their work. This situation exists in the Tram Company. They have divided the responsibilities for the cultivation and education of labor models, but they rarely implement them. For example, the Secretary of the Youth League Committee of this company has only talked to a labor model he is responsible for cultivating and educating once in the past year. Under these circumstances, the progress of labor models will certainly be affected.
    In order to change this situation, the Party, government, labor union, and youth league organizations of all factories and mines must earnestly strengthen the cultivation and education of labor models, care about their work and life, and prevent them from developing feelings of pride and complacency in a timely manner. Only in this way can labor models continue to move forward in their work. This is not only a matter of personal honor for labor models, but also a matter of the speed of development of our country's enterprises and the future of national industrialization. We must find ways to continuously improve and advance existing labor models in order to promote the continuous advancement of the general masses of workers and promote the emergence of more labor model figures.
    Labor models should realize that our cause is a collective cause, and we must unite the broad masses of workers to work together and move forward continuously in order to achieve the final victory. If we become proud and complacent and become detached from the masses after making achievements, we will lose the role of labor models, and it will be difficult to make any major improvements in our work. For comrades who have technical conservatism, we should tell them that today's era is different from the past; teaching technology to others has become a glorious thing, and they will be respected, loved, and trusted by the country and the people, and will never affect their jobs and status. If they do not teach technology to others, it will affect the construction cause, and the masses will not respect them.
    The leadership of factories and mines should thoroughly examine the work of cultivating and educating labor models, summarize the necessary experiences and lessons, and resolutely change the past situation of "being done after selection." We must educate and organize labor models to unite closely with the broad masses of workers and advance together in the construction of the motherland.

### 应该让劳动模范不断前进

    应该让劳动模范不断前进
    本报记者　朱波
    北京市铁路、邮电、印刷、纺织、机械和地方工业局所属厂矿等企业单位统计，一九五三年度共有二百七十名市劳动模范，其中一九五四年继续被评为劳动模范的有一百六十九人，由于调出学习、工作或长期患病休养而未能参加评选的有三十六人，落选的有六十五人。落选的劳动模范约占劳动模范总数四分之一。和前年相比，落选的劳动模范所占的比例大大减少了，这是一个进步。但有四分之一的人落选，仍然是一个值得注意的问题。
    据调查，这四分之一劳动模范的落选，有以下几个主要原因：
    一、是他们本身滋长了骄傲自满的情绪，满足于现有的成绩，不求进步，不虚心听取群众的意见，一直发展到脱离群众。北京邮局第七支局一位青年模范，在当选为劳动模范以前，对工作非常认真负责，曾经冒着风雨深入到郊区各建筑工地开展业务，常常工作到半夜才回来。听说有人创造了先进经验，就主动去学习，并且在局内推广，对推动局内业务工作起了很大的作用。但是在被评选为劳动模范以后，就骄傲起来了，对工作的责任心也减弱了。去年曾经因此发生了七次差错。而且在发生错误以后还不肯虚心接受群众的批评，为了推卸错误的责任而和群众争吵。邮局党委书记、工会主席曾数次对她进行教育，要她纠正骄傲自满的情绪，但是她把领导上对她的教育当作耳旁风。因此终于在去年的评模中落选了。还有的劳动模范不肯学习群众创造的先进经验，怕降低自己的身份，结果也落后了。
    二、也有一些劳动模范的落选，是因为他们有严重的技术保守思想。电车公司有一个劳动模范，他是轨道电焊组的组长，但却一直不肯把焊接技术教给组内的青年工人，而且当自己焊接质量不好时，还把责任推给别人，结果引起组内工人很大的不满。石景山钢铁厂有一个劳动模范，有丰富的制造焊条的经验，就是不肯把这些经验公开出来，领导上曾经对他进行数次说服动员，也没有解决他的思想问题。
    三、另外有一些劳动模范所以落选，是因为厂矿的党政工团组织对他们教育和帮助不够，使他们在工作中遇到困难时不能及时解决，因此在工作上没有什么新的成就。电车公司就存在这种情况。他们对劳动模范的培养和教育进行了分工，但却很少执行。如这个公司的青年团团委书记对自己负责培养教育的一个劳动模范，一年来只谈过一次话。在这种情形下，劳动模范的进步当然会受到影响。
    为了改变这种状况，各厂矿的党政工团组织，必须认真加强对劳动模范的培养和教育，关心他们的工作和生活，及时防止他们产生骄傲自满的情绪。只有这样，才能使劳动模范在工作中继续前进。这不仅是劳动模范们个人的荣誉问题，而是关系着我国企业发展速度和国家工业化前途的问题。必须想办法使现有劳动模范不断提高、前进，才能推动一般职工群众不断前进，推动更多的劳动模范人物出现。
    应该使劳动模范们认识到，我们的事业是集体的事业，必须很好地团结广大职工群众共同努力，不断前进，才能取得最后的胜利。如果有了成绩就骄傲自满，脱离群众，那就失掉了劳动模范的作用，工作上也很难有什么大的改进。对于技术上有保守思想的同志，应该告诉他们今天的时代已经和过去不同；把技术教给别人已经成了光荣的事情，他们将因此受到国家和人民群众的尊敬、爱护和信任，而决不会影响自己的饭碗和地位。如果有技术不教给别人，就会使建设事业受到影响，群众也不会尊敬自己。
    厂矿领导上应该彻底检查一下对劳动模范的培养和教育工作，总结出必要的经验教训，坚决改变过去那种“选出了事”的状况。一定要教育和组织劳动模范同广大职工群众紧密地团结在一起，在祖国的建设事业中共同前进。
