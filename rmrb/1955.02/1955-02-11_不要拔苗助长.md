    Don't Force Growth
    Zhong Xia
    The law of development for agricultural production cooperatives is from small to large. If conditions are right, appropriate expansion can demonstrate even greater superiority in production. However, disregarding conditions and blindly expanding, forcing growth, will cause unnecessary losses.
    Since last winter, in the cooperative movement, some older cooperatives, based on several years of work and according to production needs and popular demand, have appropriately expanded, which is normal and necessary. However, in a few areas, there have been unhealthy phenomena of blindly expanding regardless of the work base and the conditions of the masses.
    Under what circumstances did these cooperatives become "big"? According to materials from several regions, the main reason is that some leading cadres do not understand the complexity and difficulty of the cooperative movement, or are misled by the superficial enthusiasm of a few activists, and cannot maintain a cool head, thus encouraging the blind enthusiasm of rural cadres when assigning tasks. As for the rural cadres, they are willing to run large cooperatives, in addition to general socialist enthusiasm, also have various motivations. Cadres in Saili Village, Ding County, Hebei, were willing to run large cooperatives for the following incorrect reasons: First, they made a challenge at the meeting to run a large cooperative, and they couldn't take back their word. Second, if they didn't do it, they wouldn't do it; if they did, they would do it big; this was glorious and respectable. Third, there were many Party and League members in the village, and all kinds of work during the War of Resistance Against Japan were not behind, but now they were always asked to visit other villages, which was really "stimulating". Therefore, Party member cadres said to the Party members: "They are Party members, and so are we; if they can do it, why can't we?" Fourth, small cooperatives have too many details and are inconvenient to lead, so it is better to simply run large ones. Cooperative cadres in Tudiyao, Xiangyuan, Shanxi, said: "Herding one sheep is herding, and herding a flock of sheep is also herding, so if you're going to do it, do it big. Small cooperatives have no profit, and cadres still have to work hard and miss work." Some cadres in the suburbs of Beijing were running large cooperatives with a "race" mentality. When this village heard that that village had run a large cooperative, they said, "If they can do it, why can't we?" Tian Village immediately set up a large cooperative with 400 households. Some cadres in Bayan County, Heilongjiang, believed that "running a small cooperative doesn't quench the thirst." In order to run a large cooperative, Tiande Village forcibly pulled in small villages more than two miles away that did not meet the conditions to form a large cooperative. Some cadres blindly believed that setting up large cooperatives, expanding the area, and removing land boundaries would allow them to operate tractors. They felt that the bigger the cooperative, the more glorious it was, and the faster socialism would come. The foundations of these cooperatives are generally not good. Some are mergers of several small cooperatives; some are expansions based on a small cooperative; and some are so-called "building mounds on flat ground," setting up large cooperatives directly from mutual aid teams. For example, in Majiapu Township, Nanyuan, in the suburbs of Beijing, the mutual aid foundation was very poor, and a large cooperative with more than 200 households was established at once.
    "Rushing up, big sign-up" is their main form of mobilizing the masses. Some cooperatives "succeeded" after only a few meetings. Saili Village, Ding County, after a short period of brewing, reported more than 400 households in one day. The cadres finally stated: "Those who want to withdraw from the cooperative can withdraw within three days. After three days, they will not be able to withdraw." In order to run the large cooperative, a preparatory committee of 61 people was established, and the committee members recorded work points for their office work. Before the "Four Appraisals", more than 2,000 work points had already been recorded. The cooperative members reflected: "This alone will make us poor!" Dagudian Village, Mancheng, Hebei, has already reported more than 90 households, but the cadres still think it is not enough and want to "mobilize door to door" to form a large cooperative. Individual villages even resorted to crude means to "mobilize" the masses. For example, in Xuguantun, Dongguang County, meetings were held for several days and nights. The cadres said: "If it doesn't work during the day, open it at night; if it doesn't work at night, open it during the day. Whoever understands doesn't have to come to the meeting."
    What is the attitude of the masses? Party members, cadres, activists, and poor peasants are generally active in joining the cooperative. Although some of them have no confidence in their hearts, their determination to take the socialist road is very strong. The thoughts of other farmers are various. Some middle-peasant households in Saili Village originally wanted to "wait and see before joining," but they were "rushed" by the cadres, and the atmosphere was so oppressive that they had to say "join and see," so they reluctantly joined the cooperative. They said: "Join and see, if the sky falls, everyone will be crushed together." Those who did not join organized fake cooperatives to deal with this "movement." Yang Laosuo and other nine households with vehicles and livestock "organized themselves to work independently." After being exposed, they began to sell their livestock in large quantities. Lao Suo sold his mule, and Yang Dengke sold his donkey. In Xuguantun, Dongguang County, more than 60% of the cooperative members did not join voluntarily. Some middle peasants who lived well did not invest after joining the cooperative. After Zhang Yong'an in Majiapu Township, Beijing, joined the cooperative, his wife quarreled with him all day, saying: "Such a big stall, it won't work if you don't do it well."
    What is it like after the cooperative becomes "big"? Because there are too many mergers, too large combinations, and too chaotic expansions, the cooperative cadres generally feel "burdened." The head of the large cooperative in Xuguantun was so worried that he could not eat or sleep. He said: "If the district doesn't care, I'm going to run away!" The cooperative cadres in Dagudian Village, Mancheng, are in a state of "worry, fear, busy, and chaos": there are too many major events in the cooperative and they are too busy, the management is too chaotic, there is no way to just worry, and they are afraid of being criticized by higher authorities and complained about by the masses, feeling that they "can't pick it up, can't put it down." The head of the Song Laodong cooperative felt that running such a large cooperative at once "exceeded his own thoughts"; the cooperative members also said: "Our cooperative head is only good at running a cooperative of 40 or 50 households, but he can't do anything with such a large one." Yang Qiugu (a Party member), the head of the large cooperative in Saili Village, Ding County, said: "For the sake of the overall situation, there is hardship to be endured; we can't move forward, and we can't retreat." He felt that "the deeper we go, the deeper the water." The deputy secretary of the district party committee did not have many solutions to this situation, so he said: "Let's go! Go wherever you go!"
    The lack of leadership experience among the cooperative cadres and the unstable thinking of the cooperative members inevitably lead to confusion in production management. The large cooperative with more than 200 households in Wanshou Temple, Beijing, had chaotic labor organization. The cooperative members did not know what to do. After a few days, they wanted to withdraw from the cooperative again; in the end, only 40 households remained, and production was also affected a lot. Some large cooperative cadres in Mancheng County did not dare to hold meetings for fear that the cooperative members would raise problems that could not be solved; some cooperative members asked the cooperative head which piece of land to go to work on and what to do, but the cooperative head could not answer. These situations not only affect the morale of the cooperative members, but also have a bad influence on the masses outside the cooperative. Some people said: "It looks like a boom, but actually the back is not light." After some large cooperatives were established, livestock were fed centrally, cooperative members were unwilling to invest, there was a shortage of grass and fodder, and the livestock began to become weak. Beijugu Cooperative in Ding County has already lost one cow and one donkey. There are also many problems in the "Four Appraisals". Some appraisals are very hasty, and some cannot be appraised. Some cooperative members in Baixiang County reflected: "There are many new ones and few old ones, and we argue until midnight, and we can't do anything." Some people who have been accustomed to picking up manure all year round no longer put manure baskets on their shoulders after joining the cooperative because of the chaotic production order.
    The chaotic phenomena caused by blind expansion have begun to clear the minds of some cadres. Under the inspection and supervision of the local party committees, some of these unhealthy phenomena have been corrected. Eighteen of the fifty-seven large cooperatives with more than 100 households in Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, have been "divided into cooperatives and reduced households," becoming smaller cooperatives; more than 200 households that left the cooperatives formed thirteen mutual aid teams; the local branch of the Communist Party of China also adjusted some Party members to participate in the teams to help run the teams well. After inspecting the situation of the large cooperatives, the Cang County Committee of Hebei Province proposed to strengthen leadership over those that are indeed qualified to run well and help them run well; those that do not meet the conditions or are forced to merge should be resolutely dispersed or reduced in size. These measures are timely and necessary.
    It is worth noting here that the rectification work must be carried out through the activists in the cooperative movement, advancing and retreating with them, and strictly preventing "pouring cold water." Except for giving serious criticism to individual elements with particularly bad ideology and work style, only persuasive education methods should be adopted for general cadres and activists to make them realize the long-term and complex nature of the cooperative movement, the harm of blind advancement, and the correctness of the policy of "active leadership and steady progress." We must cherish their socialist enthusiasm, encourage their confidence in overcoming difficulties, and continue to promote the cooperative movement on a healthy road.

    不要拔苗助长
    仲夏
    农业生产合作社的发展规律是由小到大。如果条件具备，适当扩大，在生产上就能表现出更大的优越性。如果不顾条件，盲目扩大，拔苗助长，将会造成不应有的损失。
    去冬以来，在合作化运动中，有些老社在几年来的工作基础上，根据生产需要和群众要求，适当地扩大了，这是正常的，也是必要的。但是，在少数地区也出现了不顾工作基础和群众条件盲目扩大的不健康的现象。
    这些社是在什么情况下“大”起来的？据几个地区的材料看，主要原因是某些领导干部不了解合作化运动的复杂性和艰苦性，或者迷惑于少数积极分子的表面热情，不能保持冷静头脑，在布置任务时助长了乡村干部的盲目积极性。就乡村干部来说，他们愿办大社，除下一般的社会主义热情外，还有各种各样的动机。河北定县赛里村干部愿意办大社，有以下一些不正确的看法：一、在会上挑了战，要办大社，不能说了不算。二、不办则已，办就大办；这样光荣、体面。三、本村党团员不少，抗日战争时各种工作都不落后，现在老叫去外村参观、真“受刺激”。因此，党员干部就向党员们说：
  “人家是党员，咱也是党员；人家能办，咱就不能办？”四、小社头绪多，领导不方便，不如干脆办大的。山西襄垣土地窑的社干部说：“一个羊也是赶，一群羊也是赶，要办就办大的。小社没油水，干部照样费劲误工。”北京郊区有些干部是以“赛跑”的情绪来办大社的，这村听说那村办了大社，就说：“他们能办，我们就不能办？”田村一下办起了四百户的大社。黑龙江巴彦县有些干部认为“办小社不解渴”，天德村为办大社，把二里以外不够条件的小屯也硬拉过来并成大社。有些干部盲目地认为：办起大社，扩大面积，拔除地界，就可以开拖拉机。他们觉得办社越大越光荣，社会主义也就来得越快。这些社的基础一般都不够好，有几个小社合并的；也有以一个小社做底子扩大的；还有所谓“平地起堌堆”从互助组一下办起大社的。如京郊南苑马家堡乡，互助基础很差，一下子就办了个二百多户的大社。
    “轰起来，大报名”是他们发动群众的主要形式。有些社只经几次大会就“成了功”。定县赛里村经过短期酝酿，一天就报了四百多户。干部最后还声明：“要退社的三天内可退，三天以后想退也不能退了。”为了办大社，成立了一个六十一人的筹委会，委员办公记工分；还没有“四评”，就已经记下两千多工分。社员反映：“光这就要闹穷哩！”河北满城大固店村已报了九十多户，干部还嫌少，要“挨门动员”，凑成大社。个别村甚至采取粗暴手段来“动员”群众。如东光县徐官屯连开了几昼夜会，干部说：“白天不通黑夜开，黑夜不通白天开，谁通了就不用来开会了。”
    群众是什么态度呢？党员干部积极分子和贫农，一般地说是积极入社的。他们有些人心中虽然没底，但走社会主义道路的决心是很大的。其他农民的思想则是各种各样。赛里村一些中农户本来想“看看再入”，给干部一“轰”，空气压得非叫
  “入了再看”不行，就勉强入了社，他们说：“入就入吧，天塌压大家。”没有入的，就组织假社来对付这个“运动”。杨老锁等九户有车有牲口户就“组织起来单干”。经人揭破，他们就大卖起牲口来。老锁卖了骡子，杨登科卖了驴。东光县徐官屯有百分之六十以上的社员不是自愿入社的，有些生活很好的中农入社也不投资；京郊马家堡乡张永安入社后，老婆整天和他吵嘴，说：“这样一大摊，弄不好。”
    社“大”起来以后是个什么样子？由于合的太多，并的太大，扩的太乱，社干部普遍感到“包袱沉重”。徐官屯的大社社长愁的吃不下、睡不着。他说：“区里再不管，我可就要跑了！”满城大固店村社干部处于“愁、怕、忙、乱”状态：社大事多太忙，经营管理太乱，没有办法光愁，又怕挨上级批评、落群众埋怨，觉得“掂不起来，放不下去”。宋老东社的社长觉得一下办这样大，“超过了自己的心事”；社员也说：“俺社长办四五十户的社还差不多，弄这样大就没了办法。”定县赛里村大社社长杨秋谷（党员）说：“为了大局，有苦难诉；前进不能，后退不得。”觉得“越走水越深”。区委副书记对这情况办法也不多，就说：“走吧！走到哪里算哪里！”
    社干部缺乏领导经验，社员思想动荡不安，必然的结果是生产管理混乱。京郊万寿寺办起二百多户的大社，劳动组织混乱，社员谁也不知道该干什么，没几天就又要退社；最后还剩四十多户，生产也受了不少影响。满城县有些大社干部不敢开会，怕社员提出问题解决不了；有些社员去问社长该到哪块地去干活，干什么？社长也答不上来。这些情况，不但影响社员情绪，对社外群众的影响也不好。有些群众说：“看起来轰隆轰隆，实际上背背不轻。”有些大社办起来以后，牲口集中喂养，社员不愿投资，缺草少料，牲口开始瘦弱起来了。定县北俱估社已死了牛、驴各一头。“四评”中的问题也很多，有些评得很草率，有的评不下去。柏乡县有些社员反映：“新的多，老的少，一吵吵半夜，什么也干不了。”有些终年习惯拾粪的人，入社后因生产秩序混乱，粪筐也不上肩。
    盲目扩大所造成的混乱现象，已经使有些干部的头脑开始清醒起来。在各地党委的检查督促下，这些不健康的现象有些已经纠正。山西阳城县的五十七个百户以上的大社，已有十八个“分社、减户”，变成较小的社；出社的二百多户组成了十三个互助组；中共当地支部并调整出来一些党员参加到组里去帮助把组办好。河北沧县地委检查大社情况后，提出对确实有条件办好的加强领导，帮助办好；条件不具备或勉强合并的，坚决分散或缩小。这些措施都是适时和必要的。
    这里值得注意的是：整顿工作必须通过合作化运动中的积极分子来进行，和他们共进共退，严格防止“泼冷水”。除对个别思想作风特别恶劣的分子给以严肃的批评以外，对一般干部和积极分子只能采取说服教育办法，使他们从亲身体验中认识合作化运动的长期性和复杂性，认识盲目冒进的危害和“积极领导、稳步前进”方针的正确性。要宝贵他们的社会主义热情，鼓舞他们克服困难的信心，继续把合作化运动向健康的道路上推进。
