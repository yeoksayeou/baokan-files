The resolution advocated the restoration of the People's Republic of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations.

    Habibur Rehman, a leader of the Communist Party of India in Bihar Province, said at the meeting: "Taiwan is an inseparable part of the People's China.

Ramavatar Shastri also spoke at the meeting, saying that it is necessary to carry out the peace movement with greater determination to stop the danger of war.

The New Zealand Communist Party Accuses the United States of Aggravating Tensions

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Wellington news: New Zealand's "People's Voice" reported on February 2nd that George Jackson, chairman of the New Zealand Communist Party, commented on the resolution passed by the U.S. Congress authorizing Eisenhower to wage war against China in order to maintain the U.S. occupation of Taiwan, saying that the resolution greatly aggravated the tensions throughout the Pacific.

    Jackson said that Eisenhower "while demanding to prevent the return of Taiwan Island to China by force also spread the ridiculous lies of defending the 'free world'." He went on to say, "What are the facts? When the President speaks of defending Taiwan for the free world, he means making Taiwan an imperialist outpost from which to attack China."

    Jackson said, "Suppose we in New Zealand overthrew a corrupt government that oppressed us and sold out our national interests to other countries; suppose we had replaced it with the most prestigious new government in our history; suppose the defeated remnants escaped to Stewart Island or Kawau Island, and there, even to protect them from attacks by the people of those islands, they were protected by the armed forces of a great power on the other side of the world, how would you feel at the thought of allowing that great power to wage war when necessary for the benefit of imperialists to keep them there? How do you feel?" He said, "The feelings of the Chinese people are easy to understand."

    Jackson said, "Taiwan was part of China long before the Protestants arrived in America." He accused the countries that participated in concluding treaties guaranteeing the return of Taiwan to China of now treating the treaties as a "scrap of paper."

Wen Youzhang Points Out that China Has the Right to Liberate Taiwan

    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 9th: Canada's "Tribune" reported on February 7th that Wen Youzhang, chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress, cited evidence from various official documents in a statement to the press last week, proving that China has the right to recover Taiwan, and he also asked people to strictly abide by the United Nations' principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of any country.

    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Sydney news: Australia's Melbourne "Guardian" reported that Reverend A. Dick, joint secretary of the Victorian Peace Committee, said on January 26th: "The Taiwan crisis has indeed awakened the Australian people." Dick said: "China's legitimate claim to Taiwan is beyond doubt. The Cairo Conference and the Potsdam Proclamation recognized that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands are Chinese territory."

    The "Tribune" said in an editorial on February 2nd: "Australians insist that the Federal Government make it clear and public that under no circumstances will Australians be dragged into the sinful activities in Taiwan."

    美国武装部队必须立即撤出台湾
    印度各地举行要求美军“撤出台湾日”
    【新华社新德里十日电】印度各地继续传来了在二月六日举行“撤出台湾日”，要求美国武装部队立即撤出台湾和附近地区的消息。
    北方省纳吉巴巴达在“撤出台湾日”举行了火炬游行。游行的人高呼“美国必须撤出台湾”和“世界和平万岁”等口号。游行以后接着举行了群众大会。哈里希·钱德拉博士建议大会谴责美国干涉台湾。北方省农民协会总书记迪潘卡尔在会上发言，揭露帝国主义者发动新战争的阴谋。
    比哈尔省巴特那在若干团体的联合主持下举行了“撤出台湾日”群众大会。大会通过决议，谴责美国干涉台湾和邻近岛屿，并且要求外国军队立即撤出这一地区。决议主张恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位。
    印度共产党比哈尔省领袖哈比布尔·雷赫曼在会上发言说：“台湾是人民中国不可分割的一部分。美国战争贩子干涉中国的内政，这不仅是煽动战火，而且是藐视国际宣言。”他说，在爱好和平的人民的一致要求下，美国必须撤出台湾。拉马瓦塔尔·夏斯特里也在会上发言说，有必要以更大的决心进行和平运动来制止战争的危险。
    在东旁遮普省的雷瓦里和翁巴拉，都举行了“撤出台湾日”群众大会。雷瓦里的群众大会有一千人参加，由东旁遮普省立法会议议员巴布·达雅尔担任大会主席。在这次大会上发言的有不同政治见解的人。他们一致斥责美国对中国的侵略阴谋，并且谴责美国国会授权艾森豪威尔在台湾使用军事力量。他们要求立即把台湾归还给中国。会上高呼“印中人民是兄弟”、“亚洲和平万岁”、“禁止原子弹和氢弹”等口号。
    东旁遮普省桑内瓦尔塔纳的巴塔村的二百个居民举行了“撤出台湾日”集会。在会上发言的人谴责美国对中国的侵略行为。这个村的农民协会组织已经在和平呼吁书上征集了四千个签名。

    据新华社讯：惠灵顿消息：新西兰“人民之声报”二月二日报道，新西兰共产党主席乔治·杰克逊评论美国国会通过授权艾森豪威尔为了保持美国占据台湾可以对中国作战的决议说，这个决议大大加剧了整个太平洋的紧张局势。
    杰克逊说，艾森豪威尔“在要求用武力阻止台湾岛归还中国的同时还散布保卫‘自由世界’的无聊鬼话”。他接着说，“事实是什么呢？当总统说到为自由世界而要保卫台湾的时候，他的意思是使台湾成为帝国主义的前哨，从这个前哨来进攻中国。”
    杰克逊说，“假设我们在新西兰推翻了一个腐败的、压迫我们的、把我们民族利益出卖给其他国家的政府；假设我们已用一个在我们历史上最有声望的新政府代替了它；假设被击败了的残余分子逃避在斯特华岛或卡渥岛，而在那里，甚至为了使他们不受这些岛上的人民的攻击，他们为世界另一边的一个大国的武装部队所保护，在想到准许这个大国为了帝国主义者的利益在必要时进行战争好使他们呆在那里的时候，你怎么想呢？你感到怎样呢？”他说，“中国人民的感觉是容易理解的。”
    杰克逊说，“台湾在新教徒还没有到美洲之前就已经是中国的一部分了。”他指责参加缔结保证把台湾归还中国的条约的国家现在把有关条约当成一张“废纸”。
