Response to Criticism and Suggestions

    Wuhan Municipality is Strengthening Leadership over Private Theatrical Troupes
    A letter from the Wuhan Municipal Bureau of Culture: The criticisms in the "Reader's Letters" section of the People's Daily on January 16th regarding some undesirable tendencies in the performances of several private professional theatrical troupes in Wuhan are correct. The existence of these undesirable tendencies is inseparable from the Bureau's own bureaucratic work style. After the nationwide campaign against the corruption of bourgeois ideology was launched, the Bureau began to pay attention to this issue and dispatched cadres from the Drama Section and the Opera Reform Committee to conduct investigations in seven private professional theatrical troupes throughout the city. A meeting of private opera performers and representatives from state-owned theatrical troupes was convened to provide education. On January 18th of this year, a "Wuhan Municipal Private Professional Theatrical Troupe Representatives Meeting" was held, and the criticism "The People's Theater Must Not Spread Yellow Poison" published in the "Reader's Letters" section of the People's Daily on January 16th was listed as one of the documents for the meeting to study, and combined with other documents and reports for review and discussion. Cadres of the Bureau and representatives unanimously expressed their sincere acceptance of Comrade Xiao Guangdong's criticisms and resolved to work hard to improve their work.
    In order to correct the shortcomings of the past, such as the lack of management leadership and specific assistance to private professional theatrical troupes, in addition to overcoming the Bureau's bureaucratic style, state-owned theatrical troupes are also instructed to establish certain guiding relationships with private professional theatrical troupes to help them improve artistically. Guide them to gradually embark on the road of serving the people.

专栏：批评建议的反应

     武汉市正在加强对民间剧团的领导
    武汉市文化事业管理局来信：一月十六日人民日报“读者来信专页”对武汉市若干民间职业剧团在演出上的一些不良倾向的批评是正确的。这些不良倾向的存在是和我局工作上的官僚主义分不开的。在全国展开反对资产阶级思想腐蚀的斗争以后，我局开始注意到这个问题，曾派出戏剧科和戏曲改进委员会的干部，分别到全市七个民间职业剧团进行调查。并召集全市民间戏曲艺人和国营剧团代表进行教育，本年一月十八日又召开“武汉市民间职业剧团代表会议”，并把一月十六日人民日报“读者来信专页”发表的“人民的剧场不容许散布黄色毒素”的批评，列为会议学习文件之一，和其他文件、报告结合进行检查和讨论。我局干部和代表们一致表示诚恳接受萧光东同志的批评，决心努力改进工作。
    为了纠正过去对民间职业剧团缺乏经营领导和具体帮助的缺点，除了克服我局的官僚主义作风外，并责成国营剧团同民间职业剧团建立一定的辅导关系，以帮助他们在艺术上提高。引导他们逐步走向为人民服务的道路。
