New "Artificial Lens" Treatment Successfully Researched

Zhang Xihua, director of the ophthalmology department of the Fourth People's Hospital of Xi'an, has recently succeeded in researching a new ophthalmological treatment of "artificial lens" with good experimental results, following the successful trial of the advanced treatment of "corneal transplantation."

A major cause of blindness is a condition called "cataract" (a layer of white opacity that grows inside the eye). Modern ophthalmology can perform cataract removal surgery, but after removal, highly convex lenses (i.e., farsighted glasses) must be worn to restore considerable vision. This can be inconvenient for participating in study or labor.

The "artificial lens" treatment involves using a thin slice of finely crafted glass, ground to be slightly smaller than a shirt button, and engraved with optical power, to be placed in its original position after cataract removal. The advantage of the "artificial lens" treatment, simply put, is like putting farsighted glasses inside the eyeball, having the same effect as wearing glasses, but invisible from the outside.

Last September, Dr. Zhang Xihua performed the "artificial lens" surgery for the first time on Yang Wanming, a farmer from Xingping County. Yang Wanming had been blind in both eyes for seven years. After treatment, he not only regained his sight but was also able to see the small print in the newspaper. Since then, Zhang Xihua has installed "artificial lenses" for six more patients, and the treatment results have all been good.

### “人工晶状体”新疗法研究成功

    “人工晶状体”新疗法研究成功
    西安市第四人民医院眼科主任张锡华，继试验“角膜移植术”先进疗法成功以后，最近又研究成功“人工晶状体”的眼科新疗法，试验效果良好。
    盲者失明原因中主要的一种叫“白内障”（眼内长的一层白翳），近代眼科医学对“白内障”可以施行摘除手术，但摘除后需配戴高度凸镜（即远视眼镜），才能恢复相当的视力。这样，参加学习或劳动就会感到不便。
    “人工晶状体”疗法就是用一种质地精良的玻璃，磨制成比衬衣纽扣略小的薄片，刻上光度，在摘除白内障后放入原位置。“人工晶状体”疗法的好处，简单说来，就好比把远视眼镜放在人的眼球内一样，具有和戴眼镜同样效果，但从眼外一点看不出来。
    张锡华医师去年九月为兴平县农民杨万明第一次施行了“人工晶状体”的手术。杨万明双目失明七年，治疗后不仅恢复光明，并能看清报上的小字。以后张锡华又为六名患者安装了“人工晶状体”，治疗效果也都良好。
