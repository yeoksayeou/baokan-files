The first fourth meeting of the National Health Science Research Committee was held in Beijing from February 12th to 19th. More than sixty Chinese and Western medicine experts from various regions attended the meeting.

The meeting listened to and discussed the "Report Outline on the Current Tasks of Medical Science Research by He Cheng, Vice Minister of Health, at the Fourth Meeting of the National Health Science Research Committee." The report outline pointed out that in order to make medical science research work reflect the spirit of serving the overall tasks of the country during the transitional period, medical science research work must take improving the people's health and reducing diseases as its research direction. The current key tasks are: in industry, research should focus on cooling, dust prevention, moisture prevention, reducing harmful gases and chemical substances, and studying the living environment, in order to prevent common and occupational diseases; in rural areas, it is necessary to first study the control of infectious diseases, parasitic diseases, and endemic diseases according to different conditions. Vice Minister He Cheng said that in order to solve the above problems, it is necessary to pay special attention to developing traditional Chinese medicine. He also said that wholeheartedly learning from the Soviet Union is the key to doing a good job in medical science research. He emphasized that academic criticism and debate must be carried out. All the health science workers present at the meeting conducted detailed discussions on this report outline and put forward many specific opinions.

The meeting discussed and approved the "1955 Medical Science Research Plan Outline of the Medical Science Research Committee of the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China." The outline includes eight items in industrial hygiene such as "Research on the Prevention and Treatment of Silicosis"; and a total of nineteen research projects in traditional Chinese medicine, infectious diseases, parasitic diseases, and other aspects.

At the meeting, Professor Boldyrev, Chief Advisor of the Ministry of Health, gave a report on "Several Basic Situations in Organizing Planned Scientific Research Work"; Professor Nadoskavich gave a report on "Several Issues in Organizing Scientific Research Work in Higher Medical Colleges"; Professor Golek gave a report on "Methods Related to Conducting Scientific Research Work." In addition, Committee Member Huang Jiasui introduced the situation of their recent participation in the Soviet Surgical Conference at the meeting.

In order to strengthen the leadership of research work, the meeting resolved to change the "National Health Science Research Committee" to the "Medical Science Research Committee of the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China."
