More than 790,000 people who listened to the broadcast signed the "Appeal to the People of the World." Although it snowed heavily that day, people were listening to the broadcast and signing their names everywhere from the cities to the countryside. Zhang Shuyuan, a mother of four, braved the heavy snow to sign her name. She said, "In order to defend our motherland and protect our lovely children, I will devote all my strength to doing my job well and use my actions to show my determination to resolutely oppose the use of atomic weapons." Yao Jie, a blind disabled revolutionary soldier, said while signing his name: "We sacrificed blood and lives to gain today's happiness. We resolutely oppose American imperialism's use of destructive atomic weapons."
    [Our Newspaper] By February 18th, more than 120,000 people in Anshan City had signed their names against the use of atomic weapons. Among them, the number of employees who signed their names in the various production factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel Company reached 94.8 percent of the total number of employees. Employees of various factories have created new achievements in opposing the use of atomic weapons. Workers at the Anshan Iron and Steel's steelmaking plant produced 15 heats of fast steelmaking from February 12th to 16th, with No. 7 open hearth furnace alone producing five heats. The workers in Group B of the medium-sized rolling mill rolled 2,977 pieces of triangular steel on February 16th, exceeding the work plan by 40 percent, creating a new record high.

    More than 1,000 commanders, fighters, and workers of a certain unit of the PLA Construction Engineering Corps, who are working day and night on the peace construction site of the Xi'an Metal Structure Factory, have signed the "Appeal to the People of the World" of the Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council. The entire team of the advanced production group of the bricklayer's third squad, which used to vigilantly guard the coastal defense line along the Zhejiang coast day and night, held a discussion meeting immediately after signing. At the meeting, they decided that in the future they would increase the output quota by 13 percent compared to the present, in order to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan and oppose the criminal conspiracy of the American imperialist group to prepare for atomic warfare.
    The families of revolutionary martyrs and revolutionary soldiers living in Guangrong North Village, Xi'an, signed their names on the morning of the 17th. When these family members picked up the signing pen, they immediately thought of their loved ones. He Xinguo, a soldier's family member, wrote his name on the signature book first, saying that he would not only sign against the use of atomic weapons, but also encourage his son to work hard to complete the task of liberating Taiwan, so that our children and grandchildren could live a peaceful and happy life.
