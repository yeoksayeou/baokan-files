    In his opening speech, Guo Moruo said: It has been a full five years since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. The facts of the past five years have fully demonstrated the deep friendship and close unity between the 800 million people of China and the Soviet Union, which has not only promoted the prosperity of China and the Soviet Union but also strengthened the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism headed by the Soviet Union, making a great contribution to the cause of peace in the Far East and the world.

In her speech, she elaborated on the development of the new type of relationship of boundless friendship between the Soviet Union, China, and the People's Democratic countries, and the significant impact it has had on human politics, economy, culture, and other aspects. She said that the close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union over the past five years has shown how perfectly these new types of relationships are in practice. She said that the development of this new and higher type of relationship can restrain the power of any aggressor and can have a decisive effect on guiding mankind towards a better future.

    Luo Maijin, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy, spoke. He spoke of the unprecedented development and strengthening of the fraternal friendship and cooperation between the Soviet and Chinese peoples over the past five years. He said that China's international status has been unprecedentedly consolidated, and Washington's delusional plans to restore its rule on Chinese soil can only be found in the dustbin of history. The Soviet people warmly hope that the great Chinese people will liberate Taiwan and realize their sovereignty over Taiwan. They firmly believe that the just cause of the Chinese people will surely triumph. (Full text on page 2)
