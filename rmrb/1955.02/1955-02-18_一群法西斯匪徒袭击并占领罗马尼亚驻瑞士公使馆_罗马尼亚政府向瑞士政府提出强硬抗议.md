(Xinhua News Agency, February 17th dispatch) TASS reports: On the night of February 14th, a group of armed Romanian fascist bandits attacked the Embassy of the Romanian People's Republic in Bern, the capital of Switzerland. The bandits smashed the windows of the embassy, broke into the building, and occupied the embassy. The embassy driver, Aurilla Setu, was severely wounded by the bandits and died. The bandits continued to occupy the embassy until the morning of the 16th.

    The Romanian government lodged a protest with the Swiss government on February 15th.

    In a note delivered to the Swiss government, the Romanian government drew the Swiss government's attention to the particularly grave responsibility it bears under the obligations it has undertaken to guarantee the inviolability of the premises and archives of diplomatic missions, and the personal safety and lives of their personnel. The Romanian government demanded that the Swiss government arrest the perpetrators, hand them over to the Romanian authorities, and take all measures within its power to address the serious situation that has arisen.

    However, the Swiss authorities have not taken any effective measures to arrest the fascist bandits occupying the Embassy of the Romanian People's Republic.

    On the morning of February 16th, the Romanian government again sent a note to the Swiss government. The note stated that, to date, the diplomatic privileges of the Embassy of the Romanian People's Republic have not been restored. This cannot but cause extreme shock to the Romanian government and the Romanian public. The note pointed out that, in view of the above, the government of the Romanian People's Republic once again requests the Swiss government to immediately restore the diplomatic privileges of the Embassy of the Romanian People's Republic in Bern, in accordance with universally recognized and accepted international law, to arrest the fascists occupying the embassy building, and to take measures to extradite them to the Romanian authorities immediately. The note believes that the continuation of this situation due to the Swiss authorities' delay and failure to take measures will only worsen the situation and increase the responsibility of the Swiss government.

    一群法西斯匪徒袭击并占领罗马尼亚驻瑞士公使
    罗马尼亚政府向瑞士政府提出强硬抗议
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社报道：二月十四日夜晚，一群武装的罗马尼亚法西斯匪徒袭击在瑞士首都伯尔尼的罗马尼亚人民共和国公使馆。这群匪徒打碎公使馆的窗子，冲进房屋，并且占领了使馆。使馆司机奥里拉·塞图被匪徒严重击伤后身死。直到十六日早晨，匪徒们继续占领着使馆。
    罗马尼亚政府十五日向瑞士政府提出抗议。
    罗马尼亚政府在交给瑞士政府的照会中提请瑞士政府注意根据它所承担的保证外交代表团的房屋和档案、人员的人身和性命的不可侵犯性的义务而负有的特别重大的责任。罗马尼亚政府要求瑞士政府逮捕凶犯，把他们交给罗马尼亚当局，并对已发生的严重局势采取一切它能力所及的措施。
    但是，瑞士当局并没有采取任何有效措施来逮捕占领罗马尼亚人民共和国公使馆的法西斯匪徒。
    二月十六日早晨，罗马尼亚政府再次照会瑞士政府。照会说，到现在为止，罗马尼亚人民共和国的公使馆的外交特权还没有恢复。这不能不使罗马尼亚政府和罗马尼亚的公众感到极为震惊。照会指出，鉴于上述情况，罗马尼亚人民共和国政府再度要求瑞士政府按照普遍承认和接受的国际法规定，立即恢复罗马尼亚人民共和国驻伯尔尼公使馆的外交特权，逮捕占领公使馆房屋的法西斯分子，并且采取措施把他们立刻引渡给罗马尼亚当局。照会认为，由于瑞士当局的拖延和不采取措施而使这种情况继续下去，只会使局势恶化，并且加重瑞士政府的责任。
