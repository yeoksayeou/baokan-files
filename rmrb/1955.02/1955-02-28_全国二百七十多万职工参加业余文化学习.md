Currently, a large number of workers' amateur middle schools and primary schools have been established in factories and mining areas across the country. According to statistics from the end of 1954, over 2.73 million workers in various locations are participating in various forms of amateur cultural studies, nearly ten times more than in 1949. Among them, 1.07 million workers are studying in senior primary classes and amateur middle schools.

At present, the amateur middle schools established in factories and mines, as well as the night universities and correspondence schools affiliated with universities and colleges, have gradually become important learning organizations for workers with elementary cultural levels to receive secondary cultural and scientific education. Many illiterate or barely literate workers are studying in literacy classes. By the end of 1954, more than 1.3 million workers nationwide had acquired basic literacy skills through literacy studies. Many factories and mining enterprises, such as the Beijing People's Printing Plant, Shijingshan Power Plant, and Guangzhou Power Plant, have basically eliminated illiteracy. At the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, the proportion of illiterate workers was 64% in 1950, but by the end of 1954, it had dropped to 12.7%. Workers who have undergone literacy studies are being promoted to senior primary classes and amateur middle schools in large numbers.

Local factory and mine amateur middle schools have already graduated more than 20,000 students. The first group of outstanding workers cultivated by amateur middle schools have been admitted to universities and colleges such as Renmin University of China, Peking University, Tianjin University, Beijing Petroleum Institute, and Northeast Institute of Technology. A large number of graduates from senior primary classes in various regions are continuously being promoted to amateur middle schools and workers' and peasants' rapid middle schools for further study.

After workers learn culture, they no longer find it difficult to read blueprints, make plans, fill out forms, and make production records. They also frequently learn advanced experiences and absorb new scientific and technological knowledge from newspapers and popular publications. Wang Lianzhi, a student at the workers' amateur middle school attached to Lushun Middle School, applied the principles of atmospheric pressure and buoyancy he learned in physics to propose a plan to repair a dry dock gate, saving national funds. Li Zongying, an experienced veteran worker at the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's General Machinery Plant, has become a teacher at a technical school after completing the courses at the amateur school.

### 全国二百七十多万职工参加业余文化学习

    全国二百七十多万职工参加业余文化学习
    现在全国各工厂和矿区中已办了大量的职工业余中学和小学。据一九五四年底的统计，各地职工参加各种业余文化学习的有二百七十三万多人，比一九四九年增加近十倍。其中在高小班和业余中学学习的职工有一百零七万人。
    目前，厂矿中设立的业余中学，高等学校附设的夜大学和函授学校，已逐渐成为具有初等文化程度的工人接受中等文化科学教育的重要学习组织。许多不识字或识字很少的工人正在扫盲班学习。到一九五四年底，全国经过扫盲学习的一百三十多万职工，已具备了初步读写能力。北京人民印刷厂、石景山发电厂、广州发电厂等许多厂矿企业单位已经基本上扫除了文盲。太原矿山机器厂一九五零年职工中文盲占百分之六十四，到一九五四年底已降到百分之十二点七。经过扫盲学习的工人正大批升入高小班和业余中学学习。
    各地厂矿业余中学已经有二万多学生毕业，第一批由业余中学培养出来成绩优秀的职工已升入中国人民大学、北京大学、天津大学、北京石油学院、东北工学院等高等学校学习。各地大量的高小班毕业生，正源源升入业余中学和工农速成中学继续学习。
    工人们学了文化，在看图纸，订计划，填表格和作生产纪录等方面都不再感到困难了。他们还经常从报纸上和通俗书刊上学习先进经验，吸收新的科学技术知识。旅顺中学附设的职工业余中学学生王连志应用他所学的物理学中大气压力和浮力原理，提出一个修理船坞闸门的方案，节约了国家资金。鞍山钢铁公司机械总厂经验丰富的老工人李宗英学完了业余学校的课程，现在已经成为技工学校的教员了。
