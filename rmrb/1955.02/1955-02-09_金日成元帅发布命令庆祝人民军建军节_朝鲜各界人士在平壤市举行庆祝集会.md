Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 8th: February 8th marks the 7th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army. Marshal Kim Il-sung, Supreme Commander of the People's Army, issued an order and congratulated all officers and soldiers.

The order stated: Korean people and soldiers of the People's Army, you are commemorating the glorious 7th anniversary of the founding of the People's Army amidst the enthusiastic labor to fulfill and overfulfill the 1955 plan, which is the decisive year for completing the post-war three-year economic plan.

The Korean People's Army has grown into a modern and regular army with invincible combat power. The heroic Korean People's Army, together with the Chinese People's Volunteers, gloriously defended the freedom and independence of our motherland and continues to protect the revolutionary democratic base of our country and the creative labor achievements of our people after the war.

Due to the aggressive policy of American imperialism and the traitorous acts of the Syngman Rhee clique, the unanimous desire of all Korean people—the unification of the motherland—has not yet been realized. The US-Rhee clique is frantically opposing our legitimate proposals to promote the peaceful unification of the motherland and is preparing for a new war.

Soldiers of the People's Army must further consolidate the fighting friendship and unity with the soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers. They must defend the fruits of the people's labor with a more determined fighting posture and closely monitor every move of the American imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique, so as to give a decisive counterattack to any provocation by the enemy at any time.

All soldiers and non-commissioned officers of the People's Army must devote all their enthusiasm and efforts to implement the 1955 combat training program, constantly cultivate military technology and combat skills, master their weapons, and strengthen the tenacity and perseverance to overcome difficulties and execute the orders of their superiors.

All officers and generals must constantly and sincerely study Marxist-Leninist theory and advanced military science, and deeply study the rich experience of the Soviet army and the experience accumulated by our army in the Fatherland Liberation War.

All commanders and political workers must strengthen the ideological education of the troops, strengthen the firm belief of all military personnel in the inevitable victory of our just and great cause, the infinite loyalty to the Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Republic, the fervent patriotism and proletarian internationalism towards the motherland and the people.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 8th: People from all walks of life in Pyongyang held a rally on the evening of the 7th to celebrate the 7th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army.

Present at the meeting were Kim Tu-bong and other leaders of the Korean Workers' Party and the government, heads of various democratic parties and social organizations, senior generals of the Korean People's Army, heroes of the Republic, and representatives of people from all walks of life in Pyongyang, totaling more than 800 people.

The delegation of the Chinese People's Volunteers, led by Chief Representative General Wang Yunrui, was invited to attend the meeting.

Also invited to attend the meeting were diplomatic envoys from the Soviet Union, China, and various people's democratic countries stationed in Korea.

Vice Admiral Choi Jong-hak, Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, delivered a report at the meeting. He said: The current task of the Korean People's Army is to strengthen its combat strength, maintain a high degree of vigilance against the conspiracies of American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique to re-engage in military adventures, and defend the revolutionary democratic base of the Korean people and the creative labor achievements of the people. He also said: The United States is intensifying the creation of war crises in Europe and Asia, openly interfering in China's internal affairs, and hindering the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. The Korean people, together with the Chinese people and the peace-loving people of the world, demand that the United States immediately stop its aggressive actions and withdraw its armed forces from the Taiwan area.

General Wang Yunrui delivered a congratulatory speech at the meeting, saying: In order to strive for a peaceful solution to the Korean question, the unity and strength of the Korean and Chinese people are being strengthened day by day. We are guarding our positions with a hundredfold vigilance, watching the enemy. If the enemy dares to betray its faith and risk provocation, then what awaits it will be a blow doubled than in the past and an even more miserable defeat. General Wang Yunrui, on behalf of the Chinese People's Volunteers, presented a silk banner to the Korean People's Army. All participants stood up and applauded warmly.

After the meeting, the Korean People's Army Concert Troupe performed celebration programs.

    命令说：朝鲜人民和人民军将士们，在为完成和超额完成战后三年经济计划决定性的一年——一九五五年计划的热情劳动中，纪念光荣的人民军创建七周年。
    朝鲜人民军已成长壮大为具有不可战胜的战斗力的现代化正规军。英雄的朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军一起，光荣地捍卫了我们祖国的自由和独立，并在战后继续保卫着祖国的革命民主基地和我们人民创造性的劳动成果。
    由于美帝国主义的侵略政策和李承晚匪帮的卖国行为，全体朝鲜人民的一致愿望——祖国的统一——尚未实现。美李匪帮正疯狂地反对我们关于促进祖国和平统一的正当提议，进行新的战争准备。
    人民军将士要更加巩固同中国人民志愿军将士们的战斗友谊和团结。要以更加坚定的战斗姿态，捍卫人民的劳动成果，严密地监视美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮的一举一动，以便随时对敌人的任何挑衅给予决定性的回击。
    人民军全体战士、士官要尽全部热情和努力，执行一九五五年战斗训练纲领，经常培养军事技术和战斗技能，精通自己的武器，加强克服困难和执行首长命令的坚韧性和顽强性。
  全体军官和将领要经常地、诚恳地学习马克思—列宁主义理论和先进的军事科学，深刻地研究苏联军队的丰富经验和我们军队在祖国解放战争中所积累的经验。
    全体指挥官、政治工作人员要加强部队的思想教育工作，加强全体军事人员对我们正义的伟大事业的必胜信念，对朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的无限忠诚，对祖国和人民的热烈的爱国主义和无产阶级国际主义精神。
   【新华社平壤八日电】平壤市各界在七日晚举行集会，庆祝朝鲜人民军建军七周年。
    到会的有以金枓奉为首的朝鲜劳动党和政府的领导人，各民主政党、社会团体负责人，朝鲜人民军高级将领，共和国英雄以及平壤市各界人民代表等八百多人。
    中国人民志愿军代表团在首席代表王蕴瑞将军率领下应邀出席了大会。
    应邀出席大会的还有苏联、中国和各人民民主国家驻朝鲜的外交使节。
    朝鲜人民军总政治局局长崔宗学中将在会上作报告。他说：朝鲜人民军的当前任务是：加强自己的战斗力量，对于美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮企图重新进行军事冒险的阴谋保持高度的警惕性，保卫朝鲜人民的革命民主基地和人民的创造性劳动成果。他又说：美国正在欧洲和亚洲加紧制造战争危机，公开干涉中国内政，阻挠中国人民解放台湾。朝鲜人民同中国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民一起，要求美国立即停止侵略行动，把它的武装力量撤出台湾地区。
    王蕴瑞将军在大会上致祝词说：为了争取朝鲜问题的和平解决，朝、中人民的团结和力量正在日益加强着，我们以百倍的警惕严守阵地注视着敌人，如果敌人胆敢背信弃义冒险挑衅，那末，等着它的将是比过去加倍的打击和更加惨重的失败。王蕴瑞将军并代表中国人民志愿军向朝鲜人民军赠送锦旗一面，全体与会者起立热烈鼓掌。
    会后由朝鲜人民军协奏团演出庆祝节目。
