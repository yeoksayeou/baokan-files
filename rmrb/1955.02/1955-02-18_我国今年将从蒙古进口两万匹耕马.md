    According to the Sino-Mongolian agreement on mutual supply of goods for 1955, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives will import 20,000 head of draft horses from the Mongolian People's Republic this year. At present, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives is actively making preparations for acceptance inspection and transportation.

    Since the 10,000 Mongolian draft horses imported last year were welcomed by farmers, supply and marketing cooperatives in seven provinces, including Rehe, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi, have requested to manage Mongolian horses. On January 18, the Supply Bureau of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives held a symposium to discuss the allocation of horses with these supply and marketing cooperatives and signed contracts. In order to do a good job in acceptance inspection abroad, a group of personnel will be trained from February to April to inspect horses abroad. Surveying the routes for transporting horses is underway. The pre-sale of horses will begin during the spring plowing and summer hoeing season.

    我国今年将从蒙古进口两万匹耕马
    中华全国供销合作总社根据中蒙两国关于一九五五年互相供应货物的议定书，今年将从蒙古人民共和国进口两万匹耕马。目前，全国供销合作总社正在积极就验收、赶运等方面进行准备。
    由于去年进口的一万匹蒙古耕马受到农民欢迎，今年有热河、辽宁、黑龙江、河北、河南、山东、山西等七个省的供销合作社要求经营蒙古马。一月十八日，全国供销合作总社供应局召开座谈会，同这些供销合作社研究了分配马匹的数字，并签订了合同。为了作好出国验收工作，二月到四月间将训练一批出国验马人员。勘察赶运马匹路线等工作正在进行。预售马匹的工作即将在春耕和夏锄期间展开。
