Zhejiang Peasants Rationally Manage the Money from Selling Surplus Grain

    The broad masses of peasants in Zhejiang Province are enthusiastically selling their surplus grain to the state in order to support the country's socialist industrialization, support the liberation of Taiwan, and support the people in disaster areas. After selling their surplus grain, many peasants are able to keep detailed accounts of production and income, rationally manage their income from selling surplus grain, and make planned arrangements for production and life. This is of great benefit to both the state and the peasants. Photo by Xiao Feng (Manuscript from Zhejiang Daily)
    The broad masses of peasants in Zhejiang Province select the best grain to sell to the state. This is the surplus grain sold by the First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Xiangxu Township, Pinghu County.
    After selling their surplus grain, the Fengshou Advanced Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jinhua County decided to buy two more large-scale water pumps with 180 horsepower, preparing to expand production.
    After selling their surplus grain, members of the First Agricultural Production Cooperative of Caodui Township, Pinghu County, bought back two water buffaloes, preparing to improve production and strive for even greater harvests.
    After selling their surplus grain, members of the Dashugang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Lingzhi Township, Shaoxing County, purchased some industrial products according to their living needs.
    Peasants in Shaoxing County are depositing their temporarily unused money into the People's Bank.
    This is a large quantity of grain sold by the peasants to the state, being transported to the coastal defense front to support the Chinese People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan.

    浙江农民合理支配卖余粮的钱
    浙江省广大农民为了支援国家社会主义工业化建设、支援解放台湾和支援灾区人民，踊跃把余粮卖给国家。许多农民在卖了余粮以后，都能做到计算生产和收支的细账，合理支配卖余粮的收入，对生产和生活作了有计划的安排。这样做对国家对农民都有很大的好处。萧枫摄　（浙江日报社稿）
    浙江省广大农民挑选最好的粮食卖给国家。这是平湖县祥圩乡第一农业生产合作社出卖的余粮。
    金华县丰收高级农业生产合作社卖了余粮以后，决定再买两部一百八十匹马力的大型抽水机，准备扩大生产。
    平湖县曹兑乡第一农业生产合作社社员卖了余粮以后，又买回了两头水牛，准备提高生产，争取更大的丰收。
    绍兴县灵芝乡大树港农业生产合作社的社员，在卖了余粮以后，按照生活的需要购买一些工业品。
    绍兴县的农民纷纷把暂时不用的钱存入人民银行。
    这是农民卖给国家的大批粮食，正在运往海防前线去，支援中国人民解放军解放台湾。
