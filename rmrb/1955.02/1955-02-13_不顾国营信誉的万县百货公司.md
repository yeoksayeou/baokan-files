    The Wanxian Department Store Disregards National Reputation
    In September and October of last year, many organizations in the Northeast received shoe advertisements from the Wanxian City Company of the China Department Store Corporation of Sichuan Province. The advertisements featured beautiful shoe samples, with cheap prices, and specifically stated "Delivery upon receipt of payment"; welcoming mail orders and sales promotion. People had great trust in state-owned businesses, and this advertisement powerfully motivated many customers to remit money to purchase.
    But no one expected that after sending the money, shoes would not be received for several months! The Shenyang Central Chemical Research Institute ordered three hundred pairs of leather shoes in October, but had not received them by mid-December. Some people who were fortunate enough to receive shoes mostly got miscellaneous and shoddy items. What was originally ordered as cowhide soles arrived as rubber soles, and what was originally ordered in black arrived in red, and the sizes were also not as requested. Someone from the Liaodong Provincial Revolutionary Disabled Soldiers School ordered leather shoes, and the Wanxian Company replied that due to a shortage of raw materials, it was unable to continue production, and asked if they would like to change their order to fur shoes; but they also sent out a large number of sales promotion advertisements and letters to other customers saying that we have a large quantity of leather shoes for sale, please write to purchase quickly. This left many customers very distressed after being deceived.
    Many people wrote to the People's Daily exposing this deceptive behavior, and some readers listed many facts proving that "the company does not speak the truth in its sales promotion work." Some people regretted it, saying that the company's actions were really hateful, "anyway, it's several thousand miles away, and customers can't come to your door." Someone questioned "what kind of thinking is dominating this company to do this"? Some people also cursed the company for engaging in speculative activities under the guise of state-owned enterprises, and some people "demand that the local government investigate the speculators who are undermining the prestige of state-owned commerce."
    Originally, mail order business had many drawbacks. It disrupted regional commodity sales plans, increased commodity circulation costs, and could also lead to private merchants speculating and hoarding. As early as 1953, the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government instructed state-owned commercial systems in various regions to stop mail order business. Could the Wanxian Department Store be an exception? According to an investigation by the Wanxian Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, the company had accumulated some leather shoes in the first half of last year. In order to handle the backlog, the Sichuan Provincial Department of Commerce approved the outward transportation of the leather shoes, and the Wanxian Company took the opportunity to carry out a large-scale mail order business. The errors caused by this kind of capitalist management thinking are extremely serious. It violated the instructions of the Ministry of Commerce, disrupted the leather management plan, deceived customers, and damaged the reputation of state-owned commerce.
    Regrettably, the Wanxian Department Store did not recognize the seriousness of this mistake. They lightly described the mistake as a simple task-oriented view, and hastily ended the business in the face of the customers' accusations. Obviously, such handling is not satisfactory, and people are looking forward to their profound self-criticism. 　Kong Tu

    不顾国营信誉的万县百货公司
    去年九、十月间，东北有许多机关接到了中国百货公司四川省万县市公司的卖鞋广告，广告上印着漂亮的鞋样，定着便宜的价格，并特别说明“款到即可交邮”；欢迎邮购，欢迎推销。人们对国营商业是十分信任的，这个广告有力地发动了很多的顾客汇款购买。
    可是谁也料不到款子寄出去几个月，却没有收到鞋子！沈阳中央化工试验所在十月份订购了三百来双皮鞋，一直到十二月中旬还没有收到鞋子。有的人幸而收到鞋子，也多是杂七歪八的东西，原来买牛皮底的，却寄来了胶皮底，原来买黑色的，寄来的却是红色，尺寸大小也不合要求。辽东省革命残废军人学校有人订了牛皮鞋，万县公司复信说，因原料缺乏，无法继续制做，是否改订毛皮鞋；但他们对另外一些顾客又大量发出推销广告和信件说我处皮鞋大量出售，请速函购。弄得许多顾客在受骗之后十分苦恼。
    许多人写信给人民日报揭发这种欺骗行为，有的读者列举了许多事实证明“该公司在推销工作中没有真言实语”。有的人很后悔，说这个公司的作法实在可恶，“反正好几千里路，顾客不能找上门去”。有人质问“该公司究竟是什么思想在支配他们这样做”？也有人大骂这个公司在国营的招牌下做投机捣把的事情，也有人“要求当地政府查究一下破坏国营商业威信的投机分子”。
    本来，函购业务是有不少流弊的，它，打乱了地区商品推销计划，加大了商品流转费用，还会引起私商投机套购。早在一九五三年中央人民政府商业部指示各地国营商业系统停止函购业务，难道万县百货公司可以例外吗？据中共万县地委调查，这个公司在去年上半年积压了一些皮鞋，四川省商业厅为了处理积压，就批准了皮鞋外运，而万县公司却乘机大办函购业务。这种资本主义的经营思想所造成的错误是极其严重的。它违反了商业部指示，破坏了皮张管理计划，欺骗了顾客，败坏了国营商业的信誉。
    很遗憾，万县百货公司并没有认识这一错误的严重性，他们轻描淡写地把这个错误说成是单纯的任务观点，在顾主的纷纷责难下就草草了事结束业务。显然，这样的处理是不能令人满意的，人们正期待着他们的深刻的检讨。　孔突
