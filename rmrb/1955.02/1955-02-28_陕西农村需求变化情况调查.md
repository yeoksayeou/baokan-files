Investigation into Changes in Rural Demand in Shaanxi
Northwest District Supply and Marketing Cooperative Office

In December 1954, we conducted a focused investigation in Xianyang, Xingping, Lintong, Wugong, Yaoxian and other places in Shaanxi Province on the changes in material demand in the development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement. The results are as follows:

	I. Growth of Farmers' Purchasing Power

Over the past year, through the publicity and education of the general line, the agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas has developed unprecedentedly rapidly. In addition, the bumper harvest of grain, cotton and other crops, and the expansion of state unified purchase and acquisition of materials, have resulted in new increases in farmers' income. For example, the total currency issuance in Weinan Prefecture in 1954 increased by 35.32 percent compared to 1953, with the amount put into rural areas accounting for 73 percent of the total issuance. The increase in income has led to a sharp increase in farmers' purchasing power. From actual surveys: the average actual expenditure on commodity purchases per person in the Shipo Agricultural Production Cooperative (mountainous area) of the Liulin District of Yaoxian County was 345,000 yuan in 1953 and 486,000 yuan in 1954 (an increase of 40.8 percent compared to 1953). In the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative (semi-cotton producing area) in the second district of Xianyang County, the average purchasing power per person was 410,000 yuan in 1953 and 620,000 yuan in 1954 (an increase of 51 percent compared to 1953).

	II. Changes in Farmers' Purchases of Means of Production

With the increase in farmers' purchasing power and the development of agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, significant changes have also taken place in farmers' purchases of means of production.

First of all, the total value of purchases of means of production has generally increased rapidly. For example, the 23 households of the Wuxing Agricultural Production Cooperative spent a total of 19.12 million yuan on purchasing means of production in 1953, which increased to 32.33 million yuan in 1954 (an increase of 69.1 percent); the average total value of means of production purchased per household in the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative was 790,000 yuan in 1953 and 1.07 million yuan in 1954 (an increase of 35.5 percent), and is planned to be 1.2 million yuan in 1955 (an increase of 12.15 percent compared to 1954); the average total value of means of production purchased per person in the Shipo Agricultural Production Cooperative was 73,000 yuan in 1953 and 141,000 yuan in 1954 (almost doubled), and in 1955, the average is expected to reach 183,000 yuan for the planned public additions within the cooperative alone (excluding feed and personal purchases of means of production for personal use).

There is a big difference between the increase in means of production by organized farmers and individual farmers. Organized farmers increase more and faster, while individual households increase less and slower. For example, according to a survey in Xingping County on the purchase of means of production in 1954: the Zhang Mingliang Agricultural Production Cooperative bought six large carts, twenty large rakes, thirteen soil carts, twelve chaff cutters, thirty-six millstones, twenty-six iron plows, and twenty-eight walking plows. The individual farmer Li Changfa (poor peasant) only purchased one large rake, three plowshares, and one millstone eye.

Secondly, many changes have also taken place in the types and quantities needed:

The demand for new-style means of production is gradually expanding, especially in agricultural production cooperatives. Several agricultural production cooperatives surveyed generally proposed to purchase double-wheeled double-shared plows, seed drills, and other items in 1955.

The need for livestock and large carts is urgent. The Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xianyang County had 22 head of livestock and 2 large carts in 1953. In 1954, they added 5 head of livestock and 1 large cart. They plan to buy 5 head of livestock and 1 large cart in 1955. Since its establishment in 1953, the Xu Jingzhang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xingping County has replaced 16 old cattle with 11 strong cattle, and has added one mule and two donkeys. They recently plan to buy six more head of cattle. However, under the condition of a large demand for livestock, agricultural production cooperatives and individual farmers also behave differently. Agricultural production cooperatives exchange weak for strong, while individual households mostly buy small and weak ones, and a few even exchange strong for weak. Due to these reasons, the supply and marketing cooperatives are currently facing a situation where large and strong draft animals are not enough to sell, while small and weak animals cannot be sold.

The demand for commercial fertilizers is increasing. For example, the total amount of fertilizer applied by the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xianyang County in 1954 (soil fertilizer and chemical fertilizer are all converted into oil cake) was 58,500 jin, of which commercial fertilizer was 23,000 jin; in 1955, the planned amount of fertilizer applied is 89,060 jin, of which commercial fertilizer is 31,780 jin. In the Shipo Agricultural Production Cooperative in Yaoxian County, there was no habit of applying fertilizer in the past. In 1954, they purchased 2,000 jin of oil cake. In 1955, in addition to planning to purchase another 2,000 jin of oil cake, they also want to increase chemical fertilizer by 500 jin. In order to meet the people's demand for commercial fertilizers, supply and marketing cooperatives must expand the organization of fertilizer sources and carry out reasonable distribution. The unplanned method of buying and selling at will should be changed.

The demand for small old-fashioned farm implements is still very large. Numerous small farm implements are mostly consumables, and are generally owned and used by members, so they need to be replaced frequently. For example, in the 1955 production material purchase plan of the Shipo Agricultural Production Cooperative, private purchases still account for 38 percent. At the same time, under the circumstances that new-style farm implements cannot be supplied in large quantities to meet the needs of agricultural production, these farm implements are in great demand by both organized farmers and individual farmers. For example, compared with the purchase volume of various small farm implements in the Wuxing Agricultural Production Cooperative in 1954 and 1953: hoes increased by 30 percent, hoes by 20 percent, shovels by 30 percent, spades by 40 percent, sieves by 100 percent, brooms by 20 percent, wooden forks by 10 percent, wooden shovels by 250 percent, and plowshares by 10 percent. The idea that old-style means of production are no longer suitable for farmers' tastes and that we do not pay attention to actively expanding operations is very harmful.

Livestock medicine and farm implement repair costs have gradually occupied an important position in farmers' expenditures. Looking at the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xianyang County, the livestock medicine cost in 1954 was 1.24 million yuan, almost equal to the seed cost. The total expenditure on farm implements was 2.17 million yuan, of which the repair cost reached 860,000 yuan, accounting for more than 40 percent. These situations must be paid attention to.

Feed: Most farmers can be self-sufficient, but attention must be paid to regulation, otherwise it will inevitably affect the growth of agricultural and animal husbandry production. For example, the purchase of feed by the Qianjin Agricultural Production Cooperative in 1954 accounted for 17 percent of the total production investment.

	III. Changes in Farmers' Purchases of Living Materials

According to a survey of 11 households in the Shipo Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Liulin District of Yaoxian County, the total value of purchases of living materials has been rising year by year: 8.42 million yuan in 1953; 10.7 million yuan in 1954, an increase of 27.1 percent compared with 1953, and it is expected to reach 14.26 million yuan in 1955, an increase of 33.28 percent compared with 1954.

The changes in quantity and variety are: the total value of farmers' purchases of commodities such as salt, coal, paper, biscuits, cloth, and general merchandise (socks and more than a dozen other commodities) in 1954 increased by about one time compared with 1953, and some even more than doubled.

Although the above is only a survey of some areas, it also shows the situation of increased income and improved living conditions for farmers. At the same time, it must be noted and corrected that in the case of increased income and the desire to improve living conditions, many wasteful things have also occurred, such as repairing graves, visiting cities, watching operas, and eating and drinking extravagantly.

    陕西农村需求变化情况调查
    西北区供销合作社办事处
    一九五四年十二月，我们在陕西省咸阳、兴平、临潼、武功、耀县等地对农村互助合作运动发展中物资需求变化进行了重点调查。结果如下：
      一、农民购买力的增长情况
    一年来农村经过总路线的宣传教育，农业生产互助合作运动得到了空前迅速的发展，加上粮食、棉花等农作物丰收以及国家统购、收购物资的扩大，使农民收入有了新的增加。如渭南专区全区货币投放，一九五四年较一九五三年增加百分之三十五点三二，投放在农村的即占总投放量的百分之七十三。由于收入增长，已使农民购买力急遽提高。从实际调查来看：耀县柳林区石坡农业生产合作社
  （山区）平均每人实际购买商品的支出：一九五三年为三十四万五千元；一九五四年为四十八万六千元（较一九五三年提高百分之四十点八）。咸阳县二区前进农业生产合作社（半产棉区）平均每人购买力一九五三年为四十一万元，一九五四年为六十二万元（较一九五三年提高百分之五十一）。
      二、农民购买生产资料情况的变化
    随着农民购买力的提高及农业生产合作社、互助组的发展，农民对生产资料的购买也发生了显著变化。
    首先是生产资料购买总值普遍迅速增加，如五星农业生产合作社二十三户农民，一九五三年购买生产资料共支出一千九百一十二万元，一九五四年增至三千二百三十三万元（提高百分之六十九点一）；前进农业生产合作社每户平均购买生产资料总值，一九五三年为七十九万元，一九五四年为一百零七万元（提高了百分之三十五点五），一九五五年计划为一百二十万元（比一九五四年提高百分之十二点一五）；石坡农业生产合作社每人平均购买生产资料总值，一九五三年为七万三千元，一九五四年为十四万一千元（提高将近一倍），一九五五年仅社内计划公共添置部分（饲料及私人购买自用生产资料部分在外），每人平均即达十八万三千元。
    组织起来的农民和单干农民增加生产资料的情况有很大的不同。组织起来的增加的多而且速度快，单干户则增加得较少较慢。如在兴平县调查一九五四年购买生产资料情况：张明亮农业生产合作社共买进大车六辆、大耙二十个、土车十三辆、铡子十二个、磨子三十六个、铁犁二十六张、步犁二十八张。单干户李昌发（贫农）仅购入大耙一个、犁铧三页、磨眼一个。
    其次在需要的品种和数量上也发生了很多变化：
    对新式生产资料的要求逐渐扩大，特别是农业生产合作社表现得最突出。所调查过的几个农业生产合作社都普遍提出一九五五年购买双轮双铧犁、条播机等。
    对牲畜和大车需要迫切。咸阳县前进农业生产合作社一九五三年有牲畜二十二头，大车二辆，一九五四年添了牲畜五头，大车一辆，计划一九五五年买五头牲畜，一辆大车。兴平县许敬章农业生产合作社从一九五三年成立后，已将十六头老牛换为十一头壮牛，并新添了一个骡子，两个驴子，最近还计划再买六头大牛。但在大量需要牲畜的情况下，农业生产合作社和单干户表现也不同。即农业生产合作社是以弱换强，单干户多数是买小的弱的，个别户还有以强换弱的。由于这些原因，目前供销合作社在供应耕畜方面，已出现大牲口壮牲口不够卖，小牲口弱牲口卖不了的情况。
    对商品肥料的要求日益扩大。如咸阳县前进农业生产合作社一九五四年施肥总量（土粪、化学肥料一律折合为油饼）共五万八千五百斤，其中商品肥料为二万三千斤；一九五五年计划施肥八万九千零六十斤，其中商品肥料三万一千七百八十斤。耀县石坡农业生产合作社过去当地没有施肥习惯，一九五四年购入油饼二千斤，一九五五年除计划再购入油饼两千斤外，并要增加化学肥料五百斤。为了满足群众对商品肥料的要求，供销合作社必须扩大组织肥料来源，进行合理的分配。无计划的随买随卖的办法，应加以改变。
    小型旧式农具的需要量仍很大。为数众多的各种小型农具，由于大多是易耗品，而且一般是社员自有自用，需要经常添换，如石坡农业生产合作社一九五五年购买生产资料计划私人购买部分仍占百分之三十八。同时，在新式农具还不能大量供应以满足农业生产需要的情况下，这些农具无论对组织起来的农民或单干农民都是大量需要的，如五星农业生产合作社各种小型农具，一九五四年与一九五三年购买量相比：镢头增长了百分之三十，锄百分之二十，锨百分之三十，铲子百分之四十，筛子百分之一百，扫帚百分之二十，木杈百分之一十，木锨百分之二百五十，铧百分之一十。那种认为旧式生产资料已不适合农民口胃，不重视积极扩大经营的思想，是十分有害的。
    牲畜医药和农具修理费已逐渐占据农民支出的重要地位。从咸阳县前进农业生产合作社看，一九五四年牲畜医药费为一百二十四万元，差不多与籽种费相等。农具支出共二百十七万元，其中修理费即达八十六万元，占百分之四十以上。这些情况是必须重视的。
    饲料：大部农民已能自给，但必须注意调剂，否则必将影响农牧业生产的增长，如前进农业生产合作社一九五四年购买饲料部分，竟占生产总投资的百分之十七。
      三、农民购买生活资料情况的变化
    据耀县柳林区石坡农业生产合作社十一户农民的调查，生活资料的购买总值逐年上升：一九五三年为八百四十二万元；一九五四年为一千零七十万元，较一九五三年增加百分之二十七点一，预计一九五五年可达到一千四百二十六万元，较一九五四年提高百分之三十三点二八。
    在数量品种上的变化是：农民购买盐、煤、纸、饼干、布、百货（袜子等十余种商品）等商品的总值，一九五四年均较一九五三年提高一倍左右有的甚至到两倍以上。
    以上虽仅是部分地区的调查，但也说明了农民收入增加生活改善的情况。同时必须注意纠正的是，在农民收入增加，要求改善生活的情况下，也产生了许多浪费事情，如修墓、逛城市、看戏、大吃大喝等。
