The agricultural, horticultural, forestry, plant pathology, entomology, soil science, animal husbandry, and veterinary science societies affiliated with the All-China Federation of Natural Science Specialized Societies held an academic symposium from January 28 to February 6. More than 300 researchers, associate researchers, engineers from scientific research institutions across the country, professors and associate professors from higher agricultural colleges, and leaders and scientists from agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy agencies attended the meeting. During the meeting, Vice Minister Liu Ruilong of the Ministry of Agriculture and Vice Minister Zhang Hanying of the Ministry of Water Resources gave reports. Soviet expert Buniak was also invited to give a report on Maltsev's new tillage methods.

The meeting reviewed the achievements and existing problems in agricultural and forestry scientific research work in recent years. The meeting received a total of 99 thematic papers. Attendees conducted lively discussions and free debates on these papers, believing that they were basically based on the actual needs of national agricultural and forestry production. Many of them have important academic significance and have played a certain role in production practice. In terms of variety cultivation, such as "Michurin Genetics and the Selection of Long-Staple Cotton," "Improvement and Promotion of Spring Wheat Varieties in Northeast China," "Selection of Winter Wheat Varieties in North China," and "Research and Promotion Report on Hybrid Varieties among Corn Varieties in Shandong"; in terms of pest and disease control, such as "Problems in the Research and Promotion of Underground Pest Control in the Past Three Years," "Research on Wheat Midges," "Experiments on Using Cultivation Methods to Control Rice Borers in Jiangxi," "Research on the Prevention and Control of Pea Weevils in Northwest China," "The Law of Occurrence of Wheat Stripe Rust in Northwest China," and papers on locusts, rice borers, and plant pathology; in terms of agricultural technology, such as "Technical Issues for Increasing Winter Wheat Production in North China," "Investigation Report on Wheat Production Technology in Su County, Anhui Province," "Summary of Wheat Land Preparation and Moisture Conservation Experience in Linying Area, Henan Province," "Research on Cotton Soil Improvement," "Summary of Cotton Production Increase Technology in Key Points in Hebei and Shanxi Provinces," and "Cultivation and Soil Aggregates" have all contributed to the increase in grain and cotton production. In addition, after heated discussions, the meeting reached a relatively unified understanding on the research work of rice borers, rice blast, wheat rust, and locusts in the future; through the special discussion on the "regionalization of fruit trees," it clarified the main adaptable varieties of apples, citrus, and other eight kinds of fruit trees in the major producing areas in China and the future development areas, and put forward preliminary opinions on the greening of the Western Hills of the capital. The discussion on "livestock feed issues" clarified the main ways to expand the use of coarse feed, green feed, and succulent feed to solve the feed problems of large livestock and pigs; the discussion on "prevention and control of pig infectious diseases" affirmed the use value of crystal violet vaccine in the prevention of swine fever measures and pointed out the decisive significance of mass epidemic prevention for eliminating swine fever infectious diseases.

Through the discussion of thematic papers, the meeting exchanged experiences and carried out criticism and self-criticism. The meeting showed that in recent years, under the leadership of the Party and the government, agricultural and forestry scientific researchers in our country have criticized idealism and harmful tendencies of being divorced from reality, and have made significant achievements in learning from advanced Soviet agricultural science and summarizing farmers' production experience. In the past two years, comprehensive and collective scientific research work has gradually increased, criticism and self-criticism in academic research have gradually unfolded, and agricultural and forestry scientific research work has begun to embark on the correct path.

The meeting decided that in the future, the research work of agricultural and forestry science will continue to implement the policy of serving production, according to the national requirements for developing agricultural and forestry science, promoting agricultural cooperation, and ensuring increased agricultural and forestry production. Through learning from the Soviet Union and summarizing farmers' production experience, it will seek key points for increasing production and tap production potential from agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and horticulture. The meeting also suggested the establishment of a "Agricultural, Forestry and Water Conservancy Science Coordination Committee" to strengthen contact, strengthen the planning of research work, give play to the potential strength of national agricultural and forestry science work, and more effectively serve the country's agricultural socialist transformation.

At the closing ceremony on the 6th, Zhou Yang, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, made a report on carrying out academic discussions. Finally, the scientific workers who participated in the meeting all expressed their determination to bring the gains of this meeting, especially the spirit of free debate in academic matters, to all parts of the country, so that academic research work in various places can also flourish.

    农林科学工作者开学术讨论会
    中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会所属农业，园艺、林学、植物病理、昆虫、土壤、畜牧兽医等七个专门学会，于一月二十八日至二月六日举行了学术讨论会。参加会议的有来自全国各地的科学研究机关的研究员、副研究员、工程师、高等农业院校的教授、副教授、以及农林水利业务机关的领导人员和科学家共三百多人。会议期间农业部刘瑞龙副部长、水利部副部长张含英都到会作了报告。苏联专家布尼亚克也应约作了关于马尔采夫新的耕作法的报告。
    会议检查了几年来农林科学研究工作的成就和存在的问题。会议共收到专题论文九十九篇。出席者对这些论文进行了热烈的讨论和自由争辩，认为基本上是结合国家农林生产需要，从实际出发的。其中有许多在学术上有着重要意义和在生产实践上起了一定的作用。在培育品种方面如“米丘林遗传学与长绒棉选种”、“东北北部春小麦品种改良及繁殖推广”、“华北区冬麦选种问题”、“山东玉米品种间的杂交种研究推广报告”等，在防治病虫害方面如“三年来地下害虫防治的研究和推广中发生的问题”、“小麦吸浆虫的研究”、“江西应用耕作方法治螟的试验”、“西北豌豆象的防治研究”、“西北区小麦条锈病发生的规律”，及蝗虫、螟虫和植物病理等方面的论文；在农业技术方面如“华北冬小麦增产技术问题”、“安徽宿县地区小麦生产技术调查报告”，“河南临颍地区小麦整地保墒经验总结”、“棉花培土研究”、“河北、山西两省基点棉花增产技术总结”、“耕作与土壤团粒”等，对粮棉的增产都有所贡献。此外，会议经过热烈讨论，对于今后对稻螟虫、稻瘟病、小麦锈病、蝗虫的研究工作方面，也取得了比较一致的认识；通过对“果树区域化问题”的专题讨论，明确了苹果、柑桔等八种果树在国内各主要产区及今后发展地区的主要适应品种，对首都西山绿化问题，也提出了初步意见，对“牲畜饲料问题”的讨论，明确认识了扩大利用粗饲料、青饲料及多汁饲料为解决大家畜和猪饲料的主要途径；对“防治猪传染病问题”的讨论，肯定了结晶紫疫苗在预防猪瘟措施中的使用价值，指出了群众性防疫对扑灭猪瘟传染病的决定意义。
    会议经过对专题论文的讨论，交流了经验，开展了批评与自我批评。会议表明，几年来我国农林科学研究工作者，在党和政府的领导下，对唯心主义和脱离实际的有害倾向进行了批判，在学习苏联先进的农业科学和总结农民生产经验方面，已有了显著成绩。近二年来综合性的集体的科学研究工作也逐渐增加，学术研究中的批评与自我批评逐步展开，农林科学研究工作已经开始走上了正确的途径。
    会议决定，今后农林科学的研究工作，将继续贯彻农林科学研究为生产服务的方针，根据国家发展农林科学工作，促进农业合作化，保证农林增产的要求，通过学习苏联和总结农民生产经验，从农、林、畜牧、园艺等方面寻找增产关键，发掘生产潜力。会议并建议成立“农林水利科学工作协调委员会”，以加强联系，加强研究工作的计划性，发挥全国农林科学工作的潜在力量，更有效地为国家的农业社会主义改造服务。
    在六日的闭幕会上，中共中央宣传部副部长周扬作了关于开展学术讨论的报告。最后，参加会议的科学工作人员都表示决心，要把这次会议的收获，特别是学术上自由论争的精神带到全国各地，使各地的学术研究工作也蓬勃开展起来。
