Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 11th: According to the Vietnam News Agency in Hanoi on the 10th, the National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front issued a statement on February 9th, warmly endorsing the statement of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on restoring normal relations between North and South Vietnam.

The statement said: The National Committee of the Vietnam National United Front, representing the various political parties, people's organizations, people from all walks of life, and prominent figures within the Vietnam National United Front, warmly endorses the statement of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on restoring normal relations between North and South Vietnam.

The statement pointed out: The establishment of the northern and southern regions on either side of the 17th parallel is only temporary, because the people of North and South Vietnam belong to the people of the same country. During the war years, the close-knit ties of flesh and blood and sincere friendship between the people of the various regions of Vietnam were interrupted and hindered. Now that peace has been restored, every Vietnamese person longs to re-establish normal relations between the northern and southern regions.

The statement said that re-establishing relations between the northern and southern regions is fully in line with the spirit of the Geneva Accords and the final declaration of the Geneva Conference. For the people of Vietnam, this is also reasonable and beneficial to the practical lives of people from all walks of life. We firmly believe that Vietnamese people from all walks of life, both at home and abroad, will gladly and warmly respond to the proposal of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and everyone will strive to quickly realize this sincere and legitimate desire.

    拥护关于恢复北越和南越正常关系的声明
    【新华社十一日讯】据越南通讯社河内十日讯：越南国民联合战线全国委员会二月九日发表声明，热烈拥护越南民主共和国政府关于恢复北越和南越正常关系的声明。
    声明说：越南国民联合战线全国委员会代表越南国民联合战线中的各政党、人民团体、各阶层人民和著名人士，热烈拥护越南民主共和国政府关于恢复北越和南越的正常关系的声明。
    声明指出：十七度线两边的北部地区和南部地区的建立只不过是临时的，因为北越和南越的人民是属于同一个国家的人民。在战争年代里越南各地区的人民之间的血肉相连的亲密关系和诚挚的友好受到中断和阻碍，在和平已经恢复的今天，每一个越南人都渴望重新建立北部地区和南部地区的正常关系。
    声明说，重新建立北部地区和南部地区的关系是完全符合于日内瓦协定的精神以及日内瓦会议最后宣言的。对越南人民来说，这也是合情合理的，并且是有利于各阶层人民的实际生活的。我们深信，在国内或是在国外的各阶层越南人民，将欣然和热烈地响应越南民主共和国政府的主张，每一个人将努力迅速地实现这一真诚的合法的愿望。
