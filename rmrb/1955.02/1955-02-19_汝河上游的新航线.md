A New Shipping Route on the Upper Reaches of the Ru River

The trial navigation of the Runan to Suiping section of the upper reaches of the Ru River in Henan Province has been successful. This waterway historically had no navigable river channel due to excessive quicksand, so it had never been navigable. However, with the enthusiastic labor of the waterway opening workers, after long-term surveying and measurement, the "scraping river to resist shallows" method was used to successfully open this waterway. On January 29th, the first batch of eighteen wooden sailing boats set off from Xincai, passed through Bantai, Runanbu, Runan and other ports, and safely arrived at Suiping Wharf on the 2nd of this month after four days, completing the task of opening 132.5 kilometers of waterway.

The opening of this waterway connects the lower reaches of the Ru River with the Beijing-Hankou Railway, which not only facilitates the concentration of local products from various places along the Hong River (the Ru River is a tributary of the Hong River) for transport by rail, but also facilitates the distribution of various industrial products transported from the railway to the Hong River area by sailing boats. The first batch of ships arriving at Suiping Wharf have unloaded more than 80,000 jin of soybeans and hemp, and loaded more than 100,000 jin of coal transferred by train to the Runan area, and are about to leave port and return.

    汝河上游的新航线
    河南省汝河上游汝南至遂平段已试航成功。这条航道由于流沙过多，没有供船只航行的河槽，所以历史上从没通航过。但在辟航工人的热情劳动下，经过长期勘测、丈量，用“刮河抗浅”的办法，终于胜利地开辟了这一航道。一月二十九日，首批试航的木帆船十八只，自新蔡出发，经班台、汝南埠、汝南等港，历时四天，于本月二日安全抵达遂平码头，完成了辟航一百三十二公里半的任务。
    这一航道的开辟，使汝河下游与京汉铁路衔接起来，既便于集中洪河（汝河是洪河的支流）沿线各地的土产，从铁路运送出去，又便于把从铁路运来的各种工业品，利用帆船分散到洪河沿线。现首批抵达遂平码头的船只，已卸下了运来的黄豆、麻八万多斤，装上了由火车接转的、运往汝南一带的煤十万多斤，即将离港返航。
