Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, February 3rd: The Secretariat of the World Federation of Trade Unions held a meeting a few days ago to study the role the World Federation of Trade Unions and all trade union organizations should play in the campaign to collect signatures for the World Peace Council Standing Committee's Appeal to the People of the World from its Vienna meeting. A statement issued after the meeting said that the World Federation of Trade Unions fully supports the World Peace Council Standing Committee's call against preparations for atomic warfare. The World Federation of Trade Unions calls on the working people of the world to launch signature campaigns in factories and to carry out various activities to support this call, and calls on them, especially the working people and trade unions of European countries, to take the lead in the movement against the Paris Accords, which would make German militarism the instigator of atomic warfare. The World Federation of Trade Unions is convinced that all working people, regardless of nationality, trade union affiliation, political views, or religious beliefs, will be able to consolidate their alliance and intensify their struggle, and make a decisive contribution to the struggle of the people of all countries for peace, freedom, and happiness.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest: In recent days, Romania has launched a signature campaign for the World Peace Council Standing Committee's Appeal to the People of the World. Hundreds of thousands of working people have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Romanian Standing Committee for the Defense of Peace and are eagerly signing the Appeal to the People of the World.

The Central Council of the Romanian General Trade Union Confederation has issued a proclamation to workers across the country, urging them to actively participate in the signature campaign. The proclamation states that the Appeal to the People of the World is in line with the peace aspirations of the people of all countries and their will to eliminate the terror of atomic war. All the working people of Romania condemn the imperialist aggressive bloc's policy of preparing for atomic war and are determined to strive to use atomic energy for the prosperity and progress of mankind.

Xinhua News Agency: Tokyo dispatch: The Japanese newspaper "Akahata" published an editorial on January 25th entitled "Ban Atomic Weapons and Hydrogen Weapons," endorsing the call of the Enlarged Meeting of the World Peace Council Standing Committee for the prohibition of atomic weapons.

The editorial stated: The desire to ban atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and atomic and hydrogen bomb warfare is the wish of the people throughout Japan and the common desire of ordinary people in all countries of the world.

The editorial then exposed the criminal intentions of the American aggressors in preparing to launch an atomic war. The editorial stated: The Japanese people will never allow a third atomic bombing. The movement that has developed among the Japanese people over the past year, demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons and opposing war and the revival of militarism, has dealt a heavy blow to the US imperialists' plans to launch an atomic war. At the same time, the growing struggle of the people of European countries against the rearmament of West Germany has provided the Japanese people with strong assistance and encouragement.

The editorial pointed out: Peace fighters should not have a moment's relaxation in the peace movement. The major events of the past year clearly prove that if the people of all countries can firmly grasp the cause of peace in their hands and defend it to the end, war can be avoided and peaceful coexistence is possible.

The editorial finally emphasized: The Japanese people firmly support all previous decisions of the World Peace Council and this peace appeal, and will strive for its realization.

   【新华社四日讯】据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特消息：近几天来，罗马尼亚展开了世界和平理事会常务委员会告全世界人民书的签名运动。成千上万的劳动人民热烈地响应罗马尼亚保卫和平常设委员会的号召，踊跃地在告全世界人民书上签名。
    罗马尼亚总工会中央理事会向全国职工发出文告，要求他们积极参加签名运动。文告说，告全世界人民书符合于各国人民的和平愿望，符合于各国人民消除原子战争恐怖的意志。罗马尼亚全体劳动人民谴责帝国主义侵略集团准备原子战争的政策，决心争取使原子能用在为人类繁荣和进步的事业上。
   【新华社讯】东京消息：日本“赤旗报”一月二十五日发表题为“禁止原子武器和氢武器”的社论，拥护世界和平理事会常务委员会扩大会议关于禁止原子武器的号召。
    社论说：必须禁止原子武器、氢武器和必须禁止原子弹和氢弹战争的愿望，是日本全国人民的愿望，也是世界各国普通人民的共同愿望。
    社论接着揭露了美国侵略者准备发动原子战争的罪恶目的。社论说：日本人民决不容许第三次原子轰炸。日本人民过去一年来发展起来的要求禁止原子武器和反对战争、反对复活军国主义的运动，给美帝国主义者发动原子战争的计划以很大的打击。同时，欧洲各国人民日益发展的反对重新武装西德的斗争，也给予日本人民强有力的援助和鼓舞。
    社论指出：和平战士们对于和平运动不应该有瞬息的松懈。过去一年来的重大事件清楚证明，所有国家的人民如果能把和平事业牢牢地掌握在手并保卫到底，战争是能够避免的，和平共处是可能的。
    社论最后强调说：日本人民坚决支持世界和平理事会以前的一切决定和这次的和平号召，并为其实现而奋斗。
