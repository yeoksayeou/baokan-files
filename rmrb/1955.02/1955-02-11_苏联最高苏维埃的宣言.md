Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 10th. TASS dispatch from Moscow, February 9th: Declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The full text is as follows:

    The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union considers it its duty to draw the attention of the peoples and parliaments of all countries to the situation developing, both in Europe and Asia, and in other parts of the world, which greatly increases international tension and threatens the security of all nations.
    Military blocs are being established in Europe, against some other European countries. A dangerous policy of reviving German militarism is being pursued, German militarism, which not long ago unleashed a world war that brought untold disasters to the peoples of all countries.
    The danger that Europe may become the battlefield of another war is increasing. Such a war would inevitably turn into another world war.
    The situation in Asia and the Far East likewise cannot but cause concern for the fate of the world. Here, too, the peoples of all countries have a responsibility to prevent war and to safeguard the national rights of the Asian peoples, their independence, and sovereignty.
    The arms race, which comes with the policy of establishing military blocs, and the activities of establishing military bases on foreign territories are continuing and exacerbating tensions between countries.
    Some are secretly preparing for atomic warfare behind the backs of the people. Such actions are taken without considering that a devastating atomic war would cause enormous destruction and would sacrifice countless lives, especially in countries with small territories and highly concentrated populations and industries.
    Although the United Nations has deemed war propaganda inadmissible and has condemned it, some countries have issued open and shameless calls for another war and the use of atomic weapons, but these calls have not been countered in any way.
    All this requires countries dedicated to maintaining and consolidating peace to redouble their efforts to achieve such lofty goals as establishing a European collective security system, eliminating foreign interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and eliminating interference in the internal affairs of other countries, which is currently of particular importance for maintaining peace in the Far East.
    The Soviet Union believes that the arms race must be stopped. The issue of universal disarmament, first and foremost a substantial reduction of the armaments of the major powers, must be resolved without delay. Atomic weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction must be banned, and the implementation of relevant measures should be guaranteed by effective international supervision.
    The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union believes that it is of paramount importance that relations between all countries, large and small, should be based on international principles that promote friendly international cooperation in peaceful and tranquil living conditions.
    Relations between countries must be based on the principles of equality, non-interference in internal affairs, mutual non-aggression, renunciation of encroachment on the territorial integrity of other countries, and respect for sovereignty and national independence.
    These principles have become the foundation of relations between countries such as the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and India, as well as other countries, and adherence to these principles can guarantee peaceful coexistence between countries, regardless of their social and national systems.
    The peoples of all countries are deeply concerned about strengthening universal peace. They have full possibilities to prevent another war, because the forces of peace are constantly growing and are now stronger than the forces of aggression and war.
    The Soviet Union, relying on the unbreakable unity of its peoples of all nationalities and on its inexhaustible resources, is fully determined to defend the peaceful labor of its citizens and protect them from all external encroachments. As in the past, the peoples of other countries will see the Soviet state as a strong and indestructible bulwark in the struggle for peace and progress.
    The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union believes that the parliaments of all countries bear a major responsibility for maintaining and consolidating peace, because it is they who take legal action on issues of war and peace.
    The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union believes that establishing direct contact between the parliaments of all countries, exchanging parliamentary delegations, and having delegations from one country speak in the parliaments of another country are in line with the desire of the peoples of all countries to develop friendly relations and cooperation.
    The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union will sincerely welcome any steps taken by the parliaments of other countries to strengthen international peace.

    苏联最高苏维埃的宣言
      【新华社十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟最高苏维埃的宣言。全文如下：
    苏联最高苏维埃认为，它有责任提起各国人民和议会注意正在欧洲和亚洲以及世界其他地区发展的、大大增加了国际紧张和对各国安全的威胁的局势。
    某些国家反对其他欧洲国家的军事集团正在欧洲建立。一个复活德国军国主义的危险政策正在被奉行着，德国军国主义不久前还发动过一次为各国人民带来无穷灾难的世界大战。
    欧洲可能变成另一次战争的战场的危险在增加。这样一场战争不可避免地将变成另一次世界大战。
    亚洲和远东的局势同样也不能不引起对世界命运的忧虑。在这里，各国人民也有责任防止战争，保障亚洲各国人民的民族权利、他们的独立和主权。
    随着建立军事集团的政策而来的军备竞赛，和在外国领土上建立军事基地的活动正在继续着，并且加剧着各国间的紧张关系。
    有人在背着人民暗地准备着原子战争。采取这样的行动是没有考虑到：毁灭性的原子战争将造成巨大的破坏，并且将牺牲无数人的生命，特别是在领土小而人口和工业非常集中的国家里。
    尽管联合国已经认为战争宣传是不能容许的，而且已经加以谴责，但是某些国家却发出了公开的、无耻的叫嚣，要发动另一次战争、使用原子武器，但是这种叫嚣并没有遭到任何反击。
    所有这一切都要求致力于维护和巩固和平的国家加倍努力，以便达到这样一些崇高的目的，例如：建立欧洲集体安全体系，消除外国对其他国家内政的干涉，而消除对其他国家的内政的干涉，目前对维护远东和平具有特别重要的意义。
    苏联认为，必须停止军备竞赛。必须毫不拖延地解决普遍裁减军备、首先大大裁减各大国的军备的问题。必须禁止原子武器和所有其他大规模毁灭性武器、应该用有效的国际监督来保证有关措施的实行。
    苏联最高苏维埃认为具有非常重大意义的是，一切大小国家之间的关系应该建筑在能促进国际友好合作在和平、宁静的生活条件下发展的国际原则上。
    各国之间的关系必须建筑在平等、不干涉内政、互不侵犯和放弃对他国领土完整的侵犯、尊重主权和民族独立的原则的基础上。
    这些原则已成为苏联、中华人民共和国、印度这样一些国家以及其他一些国家之间的关系的基础，遵守这些原则可以保证各国之间的和平共处，不论它们的社会和国家制度如何。
    各国人民非常关心加强普遍的和平。他们有防止另一次战争的充分的可能条件，因为和平力量在不断增长，现在已经比侵略和战争势力强大了。
    苏联依靠着它的各族人民的牢不可破的团结，依靠着它的用之不竭的资源，有充分的决心保卫它的公民的和平劳动，保护他们不受外来的一切侵犯。其他各国人民像以往一样，将看到苏维埃国家是争取和平和进步的斗争中的一个坚强的、不可摧毁的堡垒。
    苏联最高苏维埃认为，各国议会对维护和巩固和平负有重大的责任。因为就战争和和平问题采取法律行动的就是它们。
    苏联最高苏维埃认为，各国议会之间建立直接的接触、互派议会代表团、一国的议会代表团在他国的议会中发表演说这些做法，是符合各国人民发展友好关系和合作的愿望的。
    苏联最高苏维埃将诚恳地欢迎其他国家的议会为加强国际和平而采取的任何步骤。于莫斯科克里姆林宫
  一九五五年二月九日
