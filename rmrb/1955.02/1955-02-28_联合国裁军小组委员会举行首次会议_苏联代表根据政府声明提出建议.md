Xinhua News Agency, London, February 27th: The United Nations Disarmament Commission Subcommittee held its first meeting in London on the 25th, following the Ninth Session of the United Nations General Assembly.

According to the resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, the Subcommittee is tasked with making new efforts to reach an agreement on the reduction of armaments and armed forces, as well as on the prohibition of atomic weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.

The representatives of the countries participating in the Subcommittee are: Canadian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Robertson; French Representative to the UN Disarmament Commission, Moch; First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Gromyko; British Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Nutting; and US Representative to the UN Disarmament Commission, Lodge.

The official communique indicated that the Subcommittee commenced its work on the 25th. The Subcommittee meeting was held in secret, and journalists were not permitted to attend.

According to well-informed sources in London, Soviet Representative Gromyko put forward specific recommendations at the meeting. It is said that these recommendations are based on the Soviet government's statement of February 18, 1955. It is known that in this statement, the Soviet government proposed that all countries undertake an obligation to guarantee that their armaments and armed forces would not be increased beyond the levels of January 1, 1955, nor would their appropriations for military purposes be increased beyond the appropriations for the 1955 fiscal year, as a first step towards the reduction of armaments and armed forces. The Soviet Union also proposed that all countries possessing atomic and hydrogen weapons completely destroy their current stockpiles of atomic and hydrogen weapons, so that atomic materials could only be used for peaceful purposes. In addition, the Soviet Union also proposed the implementation of international supervision to monitor compliance with these decisions. The recommendations put forward by the Soviet government in this statement have received a warm response among all peace-loving people, because accepting these recommendations would be an important step towards easing international tensions, consolidating peace, and reducing the burden of arms expansion.

The Subcommittee will continue its meeting on March 1.

    联合国裁军小组委员会举行首次会议
    苏联代表根据政府声明提出建议
    【新华社二十七日讯】据塔斯社伦敦讯：联合国裁军委员会小组委员会二十五日在伦敦举行了联合国大会第九届会议以后的第一次会议。
    根据联合国大会的决议，小组委员会受命采取新的努力，以就裁减军备和武装部队的问题以及就禁止原子武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器的问题达成协议。
    参加小组委员会的各国代表是：加拿大驻英国高级专员罗伯逊，法国出席联合国裁军委员会代表莫克，苏联外交部第一副部长葛罗米柯，英国外交副大臣纳丁和美国出席联合国裁军委员会代表洛奇。
    官方公报指出，在二十五日的会议上，小组委员会开始了工作。小组委员会会议以秘密方式进行，新闻记者不能参加会议。
    据伦敦消息灵通人士指出，苏联代表葛罗米柯在会议上提出了具体的建议。据说，这些建议是以苏联政府一九五五年二月十八日的声明为依据的。大家知道，苏联政府在这一声明中建议一切国家承担义务，保证不得使自己的军备和武装部队增加到超过一九五五年一月一日的水平，也不得使自己用于军事方面的拨款增加到超过一九五五年度拨款的水平，以作为裁减军备和武装部队的第一步。苏联还建议一切拥有原子武器和氢武器的国家完全销毁它们现在储存的原子武器和氢武器，使原子原料只能被用于和平用途。此外，苏联还建议实行国际监督以监督遵守这些决定。苏联政府在这个声明中所提出的建议在一切爱好和平的人民中间得到了热烈的反应，因为接受这些建议就是走向缓和国际紧张局势、巩固和平、减轻扩充军备负担的一个重要步骤。
    小组委员会将在三月一日继续举行会议。
