    The notice first pointed out: The government's measure of issuing new Renminbi is entirely to meet the needs of national planned economic construction and the wishes of the broad masses of the people. On the basis of balanced financial revenue and expenditure and stable financial prices, it will further improve and consolidate our country's monetary system to facilitate transactions and accounting. Therefore, all industrialists and businessmen should warmly support this wise measure of the government and resolutely implement the various provisions of the order with practical actions of patriotism and law-abidingness.

The notice requires local federations of industry and commerce to urge industrialists and businessmen to strictly calculate prices and conduct business transactions in accordance with the new and old currency ratios prescribed by the state, correctly handle accounts, and handle creditor's rights and debts; it is necessary to expose and oppose deception and confusion by using the simultaneous circulation of new and old currencies, as well as raising prices, hoarding and refusing to sell during the conversion of new and old currencies, and other profiteering and selfish behaviors that violate national laws. At the same time, it is necessary to be vigilant and assist the government in severely cracking down on all counter-revolutionary elements' rumors and sabotage, so that the State Council's order on issuing new currency and withdrawing the current Renminbi can be fully implemented in the industrial and commercial circles.

    The notice finally stated: The issuance of new currency is a serious test of patriotism and law-abidingness for private industrialists and businessmen. Local federations of industry and commerce must call on private industrialists and businessmen to consciously and voluntarily abide by national laws and regulations, assist the government in smoothly completing the work of issuing new currency, withdrawing old currency, and ensuring market stability.
