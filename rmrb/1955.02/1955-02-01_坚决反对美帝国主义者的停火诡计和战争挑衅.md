    Resolutely Oppose the US Imperialists' Ceasefire Plot and War Provocations
    Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction
    The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is unfolding victoriously and actively, and this just action is increasingly gaining the sympathy and support of peace-loving people around the world. Faced with this situation, the US aggressors remain stubbornly attached to their course and are recently intensifying their armed intervention in China's liberation of Taiwan from two aspects. On the one hand, they are instigating the United Nations to carry out a so-called ceasefire plot, and on the other hand, they are stepping up military actions and war provocations. US President Eisenhower's special message to the US Congress on January 24 is the clearest confession of all this.
    The Chinese people resolutely oppose all conspiracies and war provocations by the US government to obstruct our liberation of Taiwan, and the Chinese people warmly support the statement made by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai on January 24.
    On behalf of all members of the All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction and the national industrialists and businessmen we are connected with, I solemnly declare: Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai's statement expresses the solemn will and firm stance of the 600 million Chinese people. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and the liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair. This is a premise that no one can shake or change. Any interference or obstruction in our liberation of Taiwan is an infringement on our country's territory and sovereignty and will inevitably be resolutely opposed by the Chinese people.
    No conspiracy or trickery of the US government can deceive the Chinese people, and no war provocation by the US government, including atomic weapons blackmail, can intimidate the Chinese people who have been tempered in revolutionary wars. Liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is the Chinese people's unshakable determination and an action that no force can stop.
    China's national industrialists and businessmen have long been aware of the nature of US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. When US imperialists and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique colluded to rule China, no one will forget the devastation and plunder suffered by China's national industry and commerce. We have also "experienced" and are very familiar with the shameless tricks of political deception, blackmail, and intimidation used by US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Therefore, regarding this just struggle to liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and oppose US government interference, China's national industrialists and businessmen not only express their warm support as citizens of the People's Republic of China, but also as industrialists and businessmen who have suffered from the cruelty of the US-Chiang regime, both in thought and emotion.
    Precisely because we understand the US-Chiang regime, we, like the people of the whole country, will not be deceived in any way, and we resolutely oppose the US government and its followers' instigation of the United Nations to carry out a so-called ceasefire plot. The government of the People's Republic of China absolutely cannot agree to a so-called ceasefire with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique that has been spurned by the Chinese people. Such a ceasefire would be a betrayal of the interests of the Chinese people, would allow the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique to occupy Taiwan and Penghu for a long time, which means being occupied by the United States for a long time, would be tolerating the dismemberment of China by the United States, and the result would inevitably lead to further aggression against China by the US imperialists and further threats to peace and security in the Far East and the world. Therefore, not only for the interests of the Chinese people, but also for the interests of the people of all countries, the so-called ceasefire plot should be resolutely opposed.
    I also want to solemnly declare on behalf of all members of the All-China Federation of Democratic National Construction and the national industrialists and businessmen we are connected with: we will not only express our position in this way, but we will also do our work. We must heighten our vigilance, be ready at any time, and not allow the enemy to obtain any exploitable opportunity. We must transform this understanding and determination into the understanding and determination of the vast majority of national industrialists and businessmen through necessary work. We must unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, do our business well, assist the government in accelerating the country's socialist construction, and fight to the end with the people of the whole country for the liberation of Taiwan!

    坚决反对美帝国主义者的停火诡计和战争挑衅
    中国民主建国会总会常务委员会主任委员　黄炎培
    中国人民解放台湾的斗争正在胜利地、积极地展开，这一正义的行动愈来愈广泛地获得全世界爱好和平的人民的同情与支持。面临这样的形势，美国侵略者还是执迷不悟，最近正在从两个方面加紧武装干涉中国解放台湾，一方面，策动联合国来进行所谓停火的诡计，另一方面，又在加紧军事行动和战争挑衅。对于这一切，一月二十四日美国总统艾森豪威尔向美国国会提出的特别咨文是一个最清楚的供状。
    中国人民坚决反对美国政府阻挠我们解放台湾的一切阴谋诡计和战争挑衅，中国人民热烈拥护一月二十四日周恩来总理兼外长的声明。
    我代表中国民主建国会全体会员和我们所联系的民族工商业者郑重宣告：周恩来总理兼外长的声明表示着六万万中国人民的庄严的意志和坚定的立场，台湾是中国的领土，解放台湾是中国的内政，这是谁也动摇不了、变更不了的前提；对于我们解放台湾任何方式的干涉和阻挠都是侵犯我国的领土和主权，必然遭受中国人民的坚决反对。
    美国政府的任何阴谋和诡计都欺骗不了中国人民，美国政府的战争挑衅包括原子武器讹诈在内也吓不倒久经革命战争锻炼的中国人民。解放台湾和消灭蒋介石卖国集团是中国人民不可动摇的决心，是任何力量所不能阻挡的行动。
    中国民族工商业者对美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团是早有认识的。美帝国主义者和蒋介石卖国集团勾结在一起统治中国时，中国民族工商业所受到的摧残与掠夺是没有人会忘记的。对于美帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团的政治上欺骗、讹诈以及恐吓等无耻伎俩，我们也是“领教”过的，非常熟悉的。因此，对于解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团以及反对美国政府干涉的这一正义的斗争，中国民族工商业者不仅以自己是中华人民共和国公民的资格，而且以自己是曾经受过美蒋残害的工商业者的资格，从思想到情感上表示热烈的拥护。
    正因为我们对美蒋有认识，所以我们和全国人民一样不会受任何欺骗，一样坚决反对美国政府和它的追随者策动联合国来进行所谓停火的诡计。中华人民共和国政府绝对不能同意同中国人民所唾弃了的蒋介石卖国集团实行所谓停火。这样的停火，就是出卖中国人民的利益，就是使台湾、澎湖被蒋介石卖国集团长期盘踞，也就是被美国长期侵占下去，就是容忍美国割裂中国，其结果必然导致美帝国主义者对中国进行进一步的侵略，对远东和全世界和平、安全的进一步的威胁。因此，不仅为了中国人民的利益，就是为了世界各国人民的利益，也都应当坚决反对所谓停火的诡计。
    我还要代表中国民主建国会全体会员和我们所联系的民族工商业者郑重声明：我们不仅这样表示我们的立场，我们还要做工作。我们一定要提高警惕，随时戒备，不让敌人得到任何可以利用的机会。我们一定要把这种认识和决心通过必要的工作使它成为广大民族工商业者的认识和决心。我们一定要更加紧密地团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，做好我们的业务，协助政府加紧国家的社会主义建设，和全国人民一道为解放台湾而斗争到底！
