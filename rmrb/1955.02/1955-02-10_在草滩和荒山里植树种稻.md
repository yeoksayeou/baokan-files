In the suburbs of Xin Hai Lian City, Jiangsu Province, in Chaoyang Township, there are thousands of acres of grasslands and a large area of barren hills. In the past, these grasslands and barren hills were sparsely covered with weeds, and every summer and autumn, mountain floods would erupt, turning the grasslands into vast lakes, and the nearby farmland would often suffer. In 1952, the Chaoyang Township established the "Forward" Agricultural Production Cooperative. The members planned to overcome disasters, make the grasslands grow crops, and make the barren hills grow fruit trees. Last year, the cooperative decided to start from winter, to reclaim wasteland, plant trees, and grow rice in a planned way.

In winter, the cooperative specially invited technicians from the Dongxin Farm and Yuntai Farm to provide technical guidance. Around the Spring Festival this year, more than 10,000 chestnut trees and other fruit trees have been planted on the barren hills; on the grasslands, wooden frames have been built, and square ditches have been dug, and the soil in the ditches has begun to be turned over to the wasteland. It is expected that in three years, the fruit trees on the barren hills will blossom and bear fruit, and can also prevent disasters and consolidate the soil; in one year, a large amount of wheat and rice can be planted on the grasslands; the water in the ditches can also be used to raise fish, ducks, and irrigate the fields.

    在草滩和荒山里植树种稻
    在江苏省新海连市郊的朝阳乡有数千亩草滩和一大片荒山。过去，这些草滩和荒山，稀疏疏地长些野草，每年夏秋，山洪暴发，草滩就变成了茫茫大湖，附近的农田也常受灾害。一九五二年朝阳乡成立了前进农业生产合作社，社员们就计划着要战胜灾害，使草滩长起庄稼，使荒山长起果树。去年社里便决定从冬季开始，有计划地垦荒植树种稻。
    在冬季，社里特请来了东辛农场和云台农场的技术员，进行技术指导。今年春节前后，在荒山上已种上了一万多株栗子树和其他果木；在草滩上，已打好了木脚，挑成了方形的沟，并开始将沟里的泥土翻到荒田里。预计三年后，荒山的果木就可开花结果，并可防灾固土；一年后，草滩上就可大量种植小麦和水稻；沟里的水还能养鱼、养鸭、灌溉田地。
