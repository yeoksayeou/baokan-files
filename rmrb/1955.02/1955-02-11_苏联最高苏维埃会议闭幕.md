Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 10th: The Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting concluded on the afternoon of February 9th, according to TASS.

The meeting approved the Soviet Union's National Budget Law for 1955, heard a report by V.M. Molotov, First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs, on the international situation and the Soviet government's foreign policy, and approved various decrees of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

At the joint session of the Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities on the afternoon of February 9th, N.A. Bulganin, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, delivered a speech.

The Supreme Soviet adopted a resolution on V.M. Molotov's report, endorsing the Soviet government's foreign policy.

The meeting also approved the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on January 25, 1955, regarding the termination of the state of war between the Soviet Union and Germany.

The Soviet Supreme Soviet unanimously adopted a declaration calling on the people and parliaments of all countries to stop the launching of new wars and strengthen the struggle for world peace.

The Soviet Supreme Soviet decided to appoint Marshal of the Soviet Union G.K. Zhukov as Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union and G.M. Malenkov as Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers and Minister of Power Stations of the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 10th: The Council of the Union and the Council of Nationalities of the Soviet Supreme Soviet held joint sessions on the morning and afternoon of February 9th to discuss the report by V.M. Molotov, First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs, on the international situation and the Soviet government's foreign policy, according to TASS.

In their speeches, the delegates spoke of the sincere desire of the Soviet people to consolidate and expand international cooperation and to live in peace and friendship with the people of all countries. They believed that the peaceful policy pursued by the Soviet Union conformed to the will of the Soviet people, was supported by them, and should be resolutely implemented. They also criticized the policy of the aggressive blocs headed by the United States aimed at exacerbating international tensions.

N. Mukhitdinov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Uzbek Republic, focused his speech on condemning the policy of the American aggressive bloc in the Far East. He said that the people of the whole world are now watching Taiwan and other Chinese islands that have been shamelessly occupied by the United States. In order to exacerbate international tensions and launch military operations against the People's China, the United States concluded a treaty with Chiang Kai-shek and transferred a large number of its military forces to the Taiwan area. This provocative act grossly violates the basic norms of international law and the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter. The Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation have already determined that Taiwan and some other islands belong to China indisputably. Any attempt to defend its aggression against China cannot help the American imperialists and their accomplices. The people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union fully sympathize with the great Chinese people. They sincerely hope that the Chinese people will achieve complete victory in the struggle to liberate Taiwan from the aggressors as soon as possible.

M. Müürisepp, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Estonian Republic, said that everyone with a clear head understands who is responsible for exacerbating international tensions. For the benefit of American imperialism, the governments of the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany are desperately trying to get the Paris Accords, which aim to revive West German imperialism, ratified. For reasons that everyone can understand, the danger of the revival of the German Wehrmacht also makes the Estonian people uneasy. In the last forty years alone, German militarism has launched two bloody wars. This aggression has caused the most serious disasters to the Estonian people and the people of other nations. Once the Paris Accords are ratified, the ghostly shadow of German militarism will once again loom over peaceful labor. Therefore, the Soviet Union and the people's democracies will have to take the necessary measures to unite their forces to guard against the danger of war.

N. Muskhelishvili, a representative of the Georgian Republic and a famous scientist, spoke about the peaceful use of atomic energy. He said that using atomic energy for peaceful purposes is the only path that scientific research in all countries should take. In the Soviet Union, in addition to building an atomic power station with a capacity of nearly 100,000 kilowatts, research is now being carried out to directly convert atomic energy into electrical and electrochemical energy.

Marshal of the Soviet Union I. Konev pointed out in his speech that the general line of Soviet foreign policy has always been a policy advocating peace and respecting the sovereignty of all countries, large and small. The Soviet people do not threaten anyone and do not intend to attack anyone. However, if the imperialists dare to launch an attack on the Soviet Union, they will be defeated, and they will be destroyed with all their strength and all kinds of modern weapons according to the various methods of Soviet military art.

G. Burkatskaya, a collective farm chairman from the Ukrainian Republic, spoke emotionally at the meeting. She said that as a woman and a mother, I oppose the revival of German militarism and the use of atomic, chemical and bacteriological weapons. I say these words with the rights of a woman who lost her husband in the war, and a mother whose daughter was taken away by the war. I am convinced that French women who understand the sacrifices under Hitler's occupation, British women who have experienced brutal bombing, Polish and Czechoslovak mothers who know the horrors of Auschwitz and Lidice, German women who have suffered the hardships of war, and women all over the world agree with me.

Lathe operator P. Bykov said, we, the Soviet working people, support the policies of the Communist Party and the Soviet government. We will now and in the future tirelessly strengthen the defense capabilities of our socialist motherland, increase the production of steel, coal and machines, and strengthen our industry - the foundation of the indestructible power of the socialist state.

Also speaking during the discussion were Kalchenko, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian Republic, Lacis, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Latvian Republic, N. Tikhonov, a famous Soviet writer, and other representatives.

    苏联最高苏维埃会议闭幕
    【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃会议九日下午闭幕。
    会议通过了一九五五年度苏联国家预算法案，听取了苏联部长会议第一副主席兼外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫关于国际局势和苏联政府的外交政策的报告，批准了苏联最高苏维埃主席团的各项命令。
    在联盟院和民族院九日下午联席会议上，苏联部长会议主席尼·亚·布尔加宁发表了演说。
    最高苏维埃就维·米·莫洛托夫的报告通过了一项赞同苏联政府的外交政策的决议。
    会议还批准了苏联最高苏维埃主席团一九五五年一月二十五日关于结束苏联同德国之间的战争状态的命令。
    苏联最高苏维埃一致通过了一项宣言，呼吁各国人民和议会制止发动新的战争，加强争取世界和平的斗争。
    苏联最高苏维埃决定任命苏联元帅格·康·朱可夫为苏联国防部长，任命格·马·马林科夫为苏联部长会议副主席兼苏联电站部长。
      【新华社十日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院九日上午和下午举行联席会议，讨论苏联部长会议第一副主席、外交部长维·米·莫洛托夫所作的关于国际局势和苏联政府的外交政策的报告。
    代表们在发言中谈到了苏联人民要求巩固和扩大国际合作、同世界各国人民和平友好共处的真诚愿望。他们认为，苏联实行的和平政策符合于苏联人民的意志，是得到他们的拥护的，而且应该坚决地贯彻执行。他们并且指责以美国为首的侵略集团的旨在加剧国际紧张局势的政策。
    乌兹别克共和国部长会议主席努·穆希金诺夫在发言中着重斥责了美国侵略集团在远东的政策。他说，现在，全世界人民都在注视被美国无耻霸占的台湾和中国其他岛屿。为了加剧国际紧张局势和发动对人民中国的军事行动，美国同蒋介石缔结了一项条约，并且把它的大批的军事力量调到台湾地区。这种挑衅行为粗暴地破坏了国际法的起码准则和联合国宪章的基本原则。开罗宣言和波茨坦公告已经确定：台湾和其他一些岛屿无可争辩地是属于中国的。任何替自己对中国进行侵略作辩护的企图，都不能够帮助美国帝国主义者和他们的同谋者。苏联各族人民完全同情伟大的中国人民。他们衷心希望中国人民在从侵略者手里尽速解放台湾的斗争中获得完全的胜利。
    爱沙尼亚共和国部长会议主席穆里谢普说，一切头脑清醒的人都明白，是谁负有加剧国际紧张局势的责任。为了美帝国主义的利益，美国、英国、法国和西德政府拼命要使旨在复活西德帝国主义的巴黎协定获得批准。根据大家都可以理解的理由，复活德国国防军的危险性，也使爱沙尼亚人民感到不安。仅仅在最近四十年当中，德国军国主义就发动了两次流血战争。这种侵略使得爱沙尼亚人民和其他民族人民一样遭到最严重的灾难。一旦巴黎协定获得批准，德国军国主义的魔影又将笼罩着和平劳动。因此，苏联和人民民主国家将不得不采取必要的措施，团结自己的力量以防备战争的危险。
    格鲁吉亚共和国的代表、著名的科学家尼·穆斯海利希维利在发言中谈到了和平利用原子能的问题。他说，把原子能用于和平目的，这是各国科学研究工作所应走的唯一道路。在苏联，除建立近十万瓩能力的原子能发电站以外，现在还在进行着把原子能直接变成电力和电气化学能的研究工作。
    苏联元帅伊·科涅夫在发言时指出，苏联外交政策的总路线一直是主张和平、尊重一切大小国家的主权的政策。苏联人民不威胁任何人，也不打算进攻任何人。但是，如果帝国主义者胆敢向苏联发动进攻，他们将被击溃，他们将被按照苏联军事艺术的各种办法用全部力量和各种现代化武器摧毁。
    乌克兰共和国的一个农庄主席加·布尔卡茨卡娅在会上激动地讲了话。她说，作为一个妇女和一个母亲，我反对复活德国军国主义，反对使用原子武器和化学细菌武器。我是以在战争中丧失了丈夫的一个妇女的权利，以战争夺去一个女儿的一个母亲的权利来说这些话的。我深信，明白希特勒占领下的牺牲的法国妇女，经历过残暴轰炸的英国妇女，知道奥斯威辛和利台斯的惨状的波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的母亲，遭受过战争苦难的德国妇女，以及全世界妇女，都是和我有同感的。
    镟工帕·比科夫说，我们苏联劳动人民拥护共产党和苏联政府的政策。我们现在和将来都将不倦地加强我们社会主义祖国的国防能力，增产钢、煤和机器，加强我们的工业——社会主义国家的不可摧毁的威力的基础。
    在讨论时发言的还有乌克兰共和国部长会议主席卡尔钦科、拉脱维亚共和国部长会议主席拉齐斯、苏联著名作家尼·吉洪诺夫和其他代表。
