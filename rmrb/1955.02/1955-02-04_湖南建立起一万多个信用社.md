    In Hunan Province, the development of rural credit cooperative organizations is very rapid. By the end of last year, more than 11,500 credit cooperatives and more than 4,000 credit mutual aid groups had been established throughout the province. In the twelve counties of Shaoyang and Hengyang Prefectures, where work has progressed rapidly, credit cooperatives have been established in every township. The province's credit cooperatives have a total of more than 3.4 million members with 60 billion yuan in share capital. Last year alone, they absorbed more than 280 billion yuan in deposits and issued more than 320 billion yuan in loans. In Xinhua, Qiyang, Xiangtan and other regions where credit cooperative organizations have developed their business well, usury activities have been basically eliminated.

    湖南建立起一万多个信用社
    湖南省农村中的信用合作组织发展很快。到去年年底止，全省已经建立信用合作社一万一千五百多个，信用互助组四千多个。工作开展较快的邵阳、衡阳专区的十二个县，乡乡都建立了信用合作社。全省信用合作社共有社员三百四十多万户，股金六百亿元。去年一年内吸收存款二千八百多亿元，发放贷款三千二百多亿元。新化、祁阳、湘潭等信用合作组织开展业务较好的地区，高利贷活动已经基本上绝迹。
