Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 10th: TASS reported from Moscow on February 9th: The following is N.S. Khrushchev's speech at the Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on February 8th, proposing the appointment of N.A. Bulganin as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union:

Comrade Deputies:

On behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the meeting of heads of delegations to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, I propose the appointment of Comrade N.A. Bulganin as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union (stormy and prolonged applause).

We all know that N.A. Bulganin is a loyal son of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and he has dedicated all his energy to serving the Soviet people. Comrade Bulganin is a worthy student of the great Lenin and one of the closest comrades-in-arms of J.V. Stalin, the successor to Lenin's cause. He is an outstanding activist of the Party and the state (long applause).

Comrade Bulganin has demonstrated that he is an outstanding and talented organizer in his work as Chairman of the Moscow City Soviet, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Russian Federation, in the important military work he undertook during the Great Patriotic War, in his role as Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, and in recent years as First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and Minister of Defense of the Soviet Union. He has rich experience in political, state, economic, and military activities.

All of this gives us reason to hope that Comrade Bulganin will be able to competently fulfill the duties of Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union.

We are confident that the Soviet government, headed by N.A. Bulganin, will surely be able to victoriously solve the problems of further strengthening the strength of our socialist motherland, ensuring the development of heavy industry, and on this basis, enabling light industry and the food industry to achieve new upsurges, improving agriculture, and raising the material and cultural level of the Soviet people.

I believe that the proposal to appoint Comrade Bulganin as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union will receive the unanimous support and approval of all deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (stormy and prolonged applause).

    赫鲁晓夫在苏联最高苏维埃会议上的发言
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科九日讯：尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫八日在苏联最高苏维埃会议上建议任命尼·亚·布尔加宁为苏联部长会议主席的发言如下：代表同志们：
    我受苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联最高苏维埃各代表团团长会议的委托，建议任命尼·亚·布尔加宁同志为苏联部长会议主席（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）。
    我们大家都知道尼·亚·布尔加宁是苏联共产党的忠实的儿子，他把他全部的精力都贡献出来为苏联人民服务。布尔加宁同志是伟大的列宁的当之无愧的学生和列宁事业的继承者约·维·斯大林的最亲密的战友之一，他是党和国家的杰出的活动家（长时间的掌声）。
    布尔加宁同志在担任莫斯科市苏维埃主席、俄罗斯联邦人民委员会主席的工作中，在伟大卫国战争期间担任的重要军事工作中，在担任苏联部长会议副主席和最近几年来担任苏联部长会议第一副主席兼苏联国防部长的职务中，显示出他是一位卓越的、有才能的组织者。他具有丰富的政治、国家、经济和军事活动的经验。
    所有这一切都使我们有理由希望，布尔加宁同志将能够胜任苏联部长会议主席的职务。
    我们确信，以尼·亚·布尔加宁为首的苏联政府，一定能够胜利地解决进一步加强我们社会主义祖国的力量、保证重工业的发展，并且在这个基础上使轻工业和食品工业获得新的高涨，提高农业和提高苏联人民物质和文化水平的问题。
    我相信，任命布尔加宁同志为苏联部长会议主席的建议，会得到苏联最高苏维埃全体代表的一致支持和通过（暴风雨般的、经久不息的掌声）。
