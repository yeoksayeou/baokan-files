Xinhua News Agency, February 4th: China's coal mining industry will undertake large-scale capital construction this year, with total investment increasing by more than 50% compared to 1954. In addition to continuing the construction of over one hundred existing mine shafts, dozens of new, reconstructed, and restored mine projects will commence this year. Among these projects, construction will begin on vertical shaft projects such as Zhongmacun in Jiaozuo, Mentougou in Western Beijing, and Chengzhe River in Jixi, designed with the assistance of the Soviet Union or by China itself. It is estimated that dozens of mines will be put into production by the end of the year.

This year, the coal mining industry will also begin constructing several modern, large-scale coal washing plants. Once these projects are put into operation before 1958, they will be able to wash large quantities of coking coal for the state.

This year, the coal mining industry will continue large-scale geological exploration. The proven coal reserves are expected to be sufficient for the construction of more than twenty pairs of large-scale mines. In addition, the coal mining industry will invest heavily in cultural, educational, and residential construction this year. The Kailuan, Fushun, and Datong technical schools are all planned for expansion this year, and four new technical schools will be built in Hongshan, Huainan, Chongqing, and Xi'an.

Xinhua News Agency, February 5th: Technical transformation work will continue on China's existing railway lines this year. More than 240 kilometers of double-track railway are planned to be built this year, including sections of the Beijing-Hankou Railway and several busy sections of the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway. Because the Jining-Erlian Railway will be put into international through transport service this year, and the Beijing-Baotou Railway will become even busier, nearly 100 kilometers of double-track railway will also be built between Beijing and Baotou. This year, railways from Harbin to Bei'an, Suihua to Jiamusi, and the Yakeshi Forest Railway will all undergo reconstruction. Large stations in Harbin, Sujiatun, Jinzhou, Fengtai, Nancang (Tianjin), Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Datong, Shanghai, Zhenru, and Zhuzhou will be expanded and rebuilt. In addition, after the installation of automatic signaling equipment on the Beijing-Shanhaiguan Railway, the corridor connecting Northeast and North China, the transport capacity of this line will be doubled. This year, the railway department plans to build new locomotives and a large number of vehicles. The state's investment in this area accounts for 20% of the state's total investment in railways this year. This year, unified standard models for locomotives, vehicles, and steel rails will also be determined, so that locomotives, vehicles, and steel rails can be manufactured in the future according to standards of high efficiency and low cost. In addition, the railway department will strengthen the investigation and statistics of the capacity of existing railway technical equipment this year; and strengthen the investigation and research on the laws of national economic development and the laws of transport volume development, so as to provide a reliable basis for future long-term technical transformation planning.

    煤矿工业今年将进行大规模基本建设
    铁路线路今年继续进行技术改造工作
    【新华社四日讯】我国煤矿工业今年的基本建设规模很大，投资总额比一九五四年增加了百分之五十多。今年除了继续建设过去开工的一百多处矿井外，并有数十处新建、改建和恢复的矿井工程将在年内开工。这些开始建设的矿井中，有苏联帮助我国设计和我国自行设计的焦作中马村、京西门头沟及鸡西城子河等竖井工程。预计到年底有数十处矿井可以投入生产。
    煤矿工业今年还将开始新建数处现代化的大型洗选厂。这些工程分别在一九五八年以前投入生产后，就可以给国家洗选大量的炼焦用煤。
    今年，煤矿工业将继续进行大规模的地质勘探工作。预计探明的煤藏量可供建设二十多对大型的矿井。此外，煤矿工业今年对文教和住宅建设的投资也很大。开滦、抚顺和大同三个技工学校都计划在今年扩建，并将新建洪山、淮南、重庆和西安等四个技工学校。
    【新华社五日讯】我国现有铁路线路今年将继续进行技术改造工作。今年计划修建的双轨铁路有二百四十多公里，包括京汉线部分线路和石太线几个运输繁忙的区段；由于集二线年内就要实行国际联运，京包线将更加繁忙，所以北京包头之间也要修建近百公里的双轨铁路。今年，哈尔滨到北安、绥化到佳木斯之间的铁路和牙克石森林铁路等都要进行改建。哈尔滨、苏家屯、锦州、丰台、南仓（天津）、石家庄、太原、大同、上海、真如、株洲等大车站都将进行扩建和改建。此外，连接东北华北的孔道——京山线上，今年加修自动信号设备后，这段线路的运输能力将提高一倍。今年，铁路部门计划新造一些机车和大批车辆。国家在这方面的投资占国家今年对铁路总投资的百分之二十。今年内还要确定机车、车辆和钢轨等设备的统一的定型标准，这样以后就可以按照效率高成本低的标准来修造机车、车辆和钢轨。另外，铁路部门今年还要加强对现有铁路技术设备能力的调查统计；加强对国民经济发展规律和运量发展规律的调查研究工作，以便为今后长远的技术改造规划提供可靠的根据。
