   A Material Handler's Ordinary Work
   ——Chronicles of the Yangtze River Bridge Geological Drilling Team (2)
   By Our Correspondent Lu Hao
    In May 1954, geological exploration personnel from all over the country had arrived on the banks of the Yangtze River in the three towns of Wuhan. Pontoons had been anchored in the heart of the river, and drilling rigs had been installed. Because everyone had been working on land in the past, but now they were going to conduct drilling underwater in the Yangtze River, no one had any experience. So today they lacked this tool, and tomorrow they found that kind of part was insufficiently prepared, and they couldn't start work for a while.
    Material handler Sun Fengming came from Hanyang early this morning. He learned at Hankou Railway Station that the ten-inch casing they needed had been shipped from Shanghai.
    The ten-inch casing was available, but upon inspection, these casings were still semi-finished products and needed to be processed before they could be used. An organization introduced him to the Wuchang Shipyard to ask for help, but he didn't have the drilling team's letter of introduction with him at the time. He thought: if I go back and forth from Hanyang and cross the Yangtze River to Wuchang again, it would be too late for the day, so he immediately decided to cross the river directly to the Wuchang Shipyard.
    He arrived at the shipyard at noon, just when people were getting off work for lunch. He stood waiting at the gate of the Wuchang Shipyard.
    He waited until the secretary director came back after lunch. The comrade in the gatehouse introduced Sun Fengming to him. When he learned that Sun Fengming was from the Yangtze River Bridge Geological Drilling Team, he immediately warmly took Sun Fengming to the office.
    After the leaders of the Wuchang Shipyard listened to Sun Fengming's request, they immediately convened a temporary meeting of the production section chief, planning section chief, and workshop director. The meeting decided to immediately free up two lathes to process the casing for the geological drilling team day and night in three shifts, and ensure that this work would be done before the start of work.
    He returned from the Wuchang Shipyard after four o'clock in the afternoon.
    Sun Fengming knew that for the five drilling rigs waiting to start work, the processing at the Wuchang Shipyard only helped solve the problem for one drilling rig, and the processing problem for the eight-inch casing needed for the other four had not yet been resolved. At this time, he had traveled all over the machinery factories in Hankou and Hanyang. Each factory had its own production plan, and it seemed that it could not be resolved for a while. He had no choice, so he thought of the Party organization in Wuhan, and he called the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee. The comrades in the Municipal Party Committee's office told him after listening to his report that this matter could be resolved by going to the Jiang'an District Party Committee.
    Sun Fengming rushed to the Jiang'an District Party Committee. He looked at the watch on his hand; it was already past the afternoon quitting time.
    He arrived at the gatehouse of the District Party Committee. A young man in the gatehouse stood up to greet him when he saw him coming.
    "Are you Comrade Sun from the Yangtze River Bridge Geological Drilling Team?"
    "Yes." Sun Fengming was wondering why he would know my name. The young man continued, "The Municipal Party Committee just called us." He explained as if he had been prepared for a long time, "The responsible comrade of our organization has already invited the party branch secretary of the Kaiming Machine Manufacturing Factory. If you have any difficulties, you can talk to him directly. The comrades of the District Committee said that they should do their best to help you solve the problem." As he was speaking, Zhang, the general branch secretary of the Kaiming Machine Manufacturing Factory, was walking in through the gate.
    At this time, Sun Fengming's heart finally calmed down. When this eight-inch casing was shipped from out of town, the comrades at Hankou Railway Station helped him urge its delivery station by station. The comrades at the station helped him get the casing to Hankou ahead of schedule, and now the final remaining processing problem was also in sight.
    The general branch secretary asked him, "Is there any difficult problem that you need our help with?"
    Sun Fengming went straight to the point and said, "The casing we originally prepared is not enough. We need to ask you to help process more than one hundred meters of casing."
    "How long do you need it to be done?"
    "The sooner the better. Otherwise, once the water level rises, we will have to stop working."
    After listening, the general branch secretary immediately pulled Sun Fengming to call the factory. As a result, the phone could not get through no matter how many times he dialed.
      "Then let's go back to the factory together." Sun Fengming followed him to the factory.
    At the factory, they held a brief meeting with the manager, workshop branch secretary, and foreman who had not yet left work.
    After the general branch secretary introduced the situation, everyone agreed to accept the task. They said, "It is an honor to contribute to the construction of the Yangtze River Bridge!"
    The casing problem was solved, but new problems followed one after another.
    The casing had to be lowered into the river, but it was discovered that there were no lifting devices. The lifting device was an indispensable accessory for lowering the casing, so they had to ask the Hanyang Power Plant to temporarily make three of them.
    However, the geological drilling team at that time was composed of ten 500-type drilling rigs from the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Water Resources, and the Ministry of Railways. Sun Fengming gave two lifting devices to the first team, which belonged to the Ministry of Water Resources. He said to the team leader Wang Shouyi, "Lend you two to use first." Because the first team had its own repair shop, it could make this kind of lifting device.
  "Make them yourself tomorrow, and these two will be given to other drilling rigs."
    Wang Shouyi said, "Okay."
    The next morning, Sun Fengming went to see Wang Shouyi. He asked, "Team Leader Wang, how are the lifting devices coming along?"
    Wang Shouyi had his feet propped up on the table as usual, shaking them back and forth, causing the ink bottle and teacup lid on the table to shake constantly. He said slowly, "Because we can't 'work overtime', it can't be done."
    Sun Fengming was stunned when he heard this. He said to Team Leader Wang, "There are now two solutions: one is to borrow the lifting devices from the two drilling rigs that stopped drilling yesterday due to an accident and give them to the second team to use, and you can use them yourself after you make them. Another way is for your repair shop to start work earlier and give them to the second team to use as soon as they are made."
    Wang Shouyi shook his head after listening. He said, "No way." He thought to himself, why should the repair shop of our Ministry of Water Resources care about the drilling rigs of the Ministry of Geology. The second team belonged to the Ministry of Geology.
    Sun Fengming really had no other way. He knew that many workers in the second team were waiting for him outside to ask for lifting devices. He thought: anyway, he said yesterday that the two lifting devices were lent to the first team. Now he had no choice but to say, "Then return the two lent to you to the materials room."
      "I don't know you, you need Captain Su to issue a note." Wang Shouyi was deliberately making things difficult for him even though they met every day.
    Sun Fengming was filled with anger and went back to find Captain Su.
    He ran into workers from the second team on the road. Many people asked him, "Old Sun, Old Sun, how about the lifting devices?"
    He replied, "Wait a minute, they'll be here soon."
    He took the note written by Captain Su and ran back to Wang Shouyi's office. He thought: there probably won't be any problems this time.
    Wang Shouyi looked at the note, but unexpectedly he said, "This note has neither the captain's personal seal nor the official seal, I cannot recognize it." After he finished speaking, he left the office and walked away.
    Sun Fengming felt an indescribable sadness. He walked out of Wang Shouyi's office. The drillers shouted at him again, "Old Sun, dozens of us are waiting for you here, how about the casing lifting devices?"
    He waved his hand several times, indicating that they were not available yet, he was so angry that he couldn't say a word.
    He walked to the captain's office, he simply couldn't bear this anger. He thought, how can work be so difficult! He saw Captain Su and burst into tears on the desk without saying a word.
    This cry stunned everyone in the room. Judging from his appearance, he must have suffered a great grievance, but no one could imagine all the difficulties he encountered in his work, and everyone really didn't know what to say to comfort him. While he was crying, he was thinking in his heart: Crying like this won't solve any problems! Just as people were about to say something to comfort him, he had already run out of the captain's office.
    He saw Wang Shouyi walking from the steps of the dock to the boat. He ran over quickly and shouted, "Team Leader Wang, Team Leader Wang..."
    He ran to Wang Shouyi and said, "Team Leader Wang, everyone is waiting to start work, please make the lifting devices!"
    "I thought you weren't going to do it," Wang Shouyi said shamelessly.
      "Don't be angry with me," Sun Fengming said, "I am too young, I don't know how to do work yet. So many people are waiting for the casing lifting devices, this problem still needs to be solved."
    At this time, the people standing next to Wang Shouyi couldn't help but speak up. They said, "Team Leader Wang, the problem still needs to be solved."
    Wang Shouyi reluctantly returned to the team headquarters. It was already ten o'clock in the morning when the lifting devices were made, and the workers went to work.
    It was raining constantly, and the flood was rising continuously. The torrential river water was almost level with the embankment. Seeing that the flood was coming, the geological drilling team was ordered to move to higher ground. The comrades in the materials room were left to guard the warehouse.
    Their warehouse was close to the river. Thousands of water jets emerged from the ground. The water of the Yangtze River had overflowed in some places.
    The warehouse was piled with all kinds of materials, some of which could not be exposed to water or vibration. They raised bricks and wooden boxes one meter high, then laid wooden boards on top, and then moved the equipment onto the wooden boards. In five days, the equipment in the two warehouses was moved.
    The water quickly flooded up. Except for a telephone in their room that kept them in contact with the team headquarters, only a few of them were left in the empty yard.
    The water outside the warehouse had risen to chest height. The bricks that had been padded up a few days ago, the bottom layers were already submerged in the water.
    At first, to go to the dining hall for dinner, people could stand on a temporary wooden raft made of two planks and paddle over with a bamboo pole; now, in some places, the bamboo pole could no longer reach the bottom, the wooden raft was beaten by the waves, and people could no longer stand still.
    The comrades in the materials room slept in the warehouse. A few days ago, only half of the bed legs were buried in the water; now a layer of floor was built underneath, and then the bed was placed on top of the floor. People seemed to be sleeping on the water.
    People took turns watching the water, as if watching the water rise, changing shifts every three hours, if it didn't rise two centimeters, it would definitely rise one and a half centimeters.
    More than half of the wooden boards that were originally padded up to one meter high were already submerged in the water.
    They called the team headquarters to report the water situation, and the team headquarters sent them a wooden boat at night. The wooden boat came directly and docked next to the warehouse. In order to prevent them from having danger at night, the team headquarters asked them to sleep on the wooden boat at night.
    In this way, the safety of people was taken care of, but the safety of materials had not yet been resolved. They requested that the materials be loaded on the wooden boat, but at that time there were few wooden boats, and it could not be resolved for a while.
    Just when they were in trouble, Yang Zaitian, Deputy Director of the Wuhan Bridge Engineering Bureau, took a small wooden boat to the warehouse to inspect the flood prevention work.
    He asked, "How are you holding on?"
    "We're okay," said the comrades in the materials room.
    "If the flood rises to thirty meters, what measures can you take?"
      "We are running into difficulties," Sun Fengming told the director about their situation.
    Director Yang said, "We will find a way to help you solve it." They stayed for a while, and the small wooden boat paddled to other units.
    On the same day, the team headquarters decided to allocate them a wooden boat day and night. Later, three comrades from the materials section of the engineering bureau also came to help them move the materials.
    Shortly after they moved the materials onto the boat, the wooden boards that were originally padded up to one meter high in the warehouse were submerged by the flood.
    They received and issued materials on the boat during the day, and the wooden boat became their floating warehouse; they slept on the boat at night, and the wooden boat became their dormitory. In those days, they sometimes guarded iron anchors weighing thousands of kilograms all night long, personally carrying them with the porters, carefully crossing the embankment, and transporting them from Hankou to Hanyang; sometimes they stood in the river, pushing empty diesel drums floating on the water, and sending them to the shore. Even a screw or a steel wire rope was delivered to the workers' hands after their painstaking efforts. Like the drillers on the pontoon, they persevered in their work in such an ordinary and tenacious way.

   一个材料员的平常的工作
   ——长江大桥地质钻探队纪事之二
   本报记者　陆灏
    一九五四年五月里，从全国各地来的地质勘探人员都已经到了武汉三镇的长江边上，趸船已在江心抛锚定位，钻机也已安装完毕。由于过去大家都在陆地上工作，现在却要在长江水下进行钻探，谁也没有经验，所以今天缺少这个工具，明天又发现那种零件准备不足，一时开不了工。
    材料员孙凤鸣今天一早就从汉阳来，他在汉口车站知道他们要的十寸套管已经从上海运到了。
    十寸套管是有了，但一看这些套管还都是半成品，需要加工以后才能用。有一个机关介绍他到武昌造船厂去请求帮忙，但他当时手里没有钻探队的介绍信，他想：如果来回汉阳再渡长江到武昌去，这样一天就来不及了，于是他就马上打定主意渡江直接到武昌造船厂去。
    他到造船厂，正是中午，人们都下班吃午饭去了。他就站在武昌造船厂的门口等着。
    一直等到秘书主任吃完午饭回来，传达室的同志在门口介绍孙凤鸣认识了他，当知道孙凤鸣是从长江大桥地质钻探队来的，他马上便热情地带孙凤鸣到办公室去。
    武昌造船厂的领导方面听取了孙凤鸣的要求以后，他们马上召集了生产科长、计划科长、车间主任临时开了一个会。会上决定立刻腾出两部车床来，日夜三班为地质钻探队的套管加工，并保证在开工以前把这批活做出来。
    他从武昌造船厂回来，已经是下午四点多钟了。
    孙凤鸣知道等着开工的五部钻机，武昌造船厂的加工只是帮助其中一部钻机解决了问题，另外四部要用的八寸套管的加工问题还没有得到解决。此时，他已经走遍了汉口和汉阳的机械厂，每个厂有它自己的生产计划，看来一时都无法解决。他没有办法，他想到武汉的党的组织，于是他给中共武汉市委机关打了一个电话。市委办公厅的同志听了他的报告以后，告诉他这件事情可以去找江岸区区委机关解决。
    孙凤鸣赶到江岸区区委机关，他看看手上的表，已经过了下午下班的时间了。
    他到了区委机关的传达室，传达室的一个小伙子，见他过来，就站起来招呼他。
    “你是不是长江大桥地质钻探队的孙同志？”
    “是的。”孙凤鸣正在奇怪地想为什么他会知道我的名字呢？那个小伙子接着又说话了。
    “刚才市委已经给我们来过电话。”他好像是早有准备地解释说：“我们机关的负责同志已经把开明机器制造厂党的总支书记请来了，你有什么困难，可以直接和他谈。区委同志说过，要求他们尽力帮助你们解决问题。”他正说着，开明机器制造厂的张总支书记正走进大门来。
    这时候，孙凤鸣的心才豁然落下来了。这八寸套管从外地运来的时候，是汉口车站的同志帮他一个车站挨着一个车站催来的，车站上的同志帮助他把套管提前运到了汉口，现在最后剩下的加工问题也有眉目了。
    总支书记问他：“是不是有什么困难问题需要我们帮忙？”
    孙凤鸣开门见山地说：“我们原来准备的套管不够用了，现在有一百多公尺套管要请你们帮助加工。”
    “要在多长时间内做出来？”
    “越快越好。否则水位一高，我们就要停工了。”
    总支书记听了以后，他马上拉着孙凤鸣一块向厂里打电话，结果电话打了几遍都打不通。
      “那我们一块回厂里去吧。”孙凤鸣跟着他到厂里去。
    在厂里，他们和还没有下班的经理、车间支部书记和工长举行了一个简短的会议。
    当总支书记把情况介绍以后，大家都同意把这个任务接受下来。他们说：“为长江大桥的建设出点力，这是一个光荣的任务！”
    套管问题解决了，但新的问题又接踵而至。
    套管要下到江里，但是发现没有提引器，提引器是提下套管不可缺少的附件，于是只好请汉阳动力厂临时帮忙做了三个。
    可是当时的地质钻探队，是由中央地质部、水利部、铁道部三个分队的十部五○○型的钻机组织成的。孙凤鸣把两个提引器给了属于水利部的一分队。他对分队长王守义说：“先借给你们两个用。”因为一分队自己有个修配间，可以做这种提引器。
  “明天你们自己做出来，这两个就再给别的钻机用。”
    王守义说：“好吧。”
    第二天早晨，孙凤鸣去见王守义。他问：“王队长，提引器做得怎么样？”
    王守义两只脚像平常一样跷在桌面上，一抖一抖，把桌子上的墨水瓶、茶杯盖子弄得直摇晃。他慢吞吞地说：“因为不能‘加班加点’，所以做不成了。”
    孙凤鸣听了一愣，他对王队长说：“现在有两个解决的办法：一个是把你们昨天出事故停钻的两部钻机上的提引器现在借给二分队用，你们自己做出来后就自己用。另一个办法是你们修配间早一点开始工作，做出来后马上给二分队用。”
    王守义听了摇摇头。他说：“不行。”他心想我水利部的修配间何必管地质部的钻机。二分队是属于地质部的。
    孙凤鸣实在没有别的办法了。他知道二分队还有许多工人在门口等着他要提引器呢。他想：反正昨天说过那两个提引器是借给一分队用的。现在他就只好说：“那么把借给你们的两个还给材料室吧。”
      “我不认识你，你要苏队长开张条子来。”明明是天天见面，王守义却故意为难他。
    孙凤鸣蹩了一肚子气，回来找苏队长。
    路上碰见二分队的工人。很多人问他：“老孙，老孙，提引器怎么样。”
    他回答说：“等一等吧，一会儿就有了。”
    他拿了苏队长写的条子跑回王守义的办公室。他想：这一下大约没有什么问题了。
    王守义看了看条子，想不到他说：“这个条子既无队长的私章，又无公章，我不能承认它。”他说完话，就离开办公室扬长走了。
    孙凤鸣是说不出来的难过。他从王守义的办公室走出来。钻工们又喊他：“老孙，我们几十个人都在这里等着你，套管提引器怎么样？”
    他用手摆了几摆，表示现在还没有，他气得一句话也说不出来。
    他走到队长办公室，这一肚子气他简直是受不了。他想，工作怎么这样难啊！见了苏队长一言不发，就伏在桌子上大哭起来。
    这一哭，把屋里的人都愣得发起呆来，看他的样子，他一定是受了莫大的委屈，但谁也难以想像他在工作上所碰到的全部的困难，大家真不知道说些什么话安慰他才好。他一边哭，可是心里却一边想：光这样哭，也不能解决什么问题啊！人们正想说些什么安慰他的话，他已经跑出队长办公室了。
    他看见王守义正从码头的台阶上走到船上去。他快步跑过去喊：“王队长，王队长……。”
    他跑到了王守义的跟前，他说：“王队长，大家都在等着开工，还是请你们做做提引器吧！”
    “我以为你不做了呢。”王守义厚着脸皮说。
      “你不要跟我生气。”孙凤鸣说：“我还太年轻，我还不会做工作。那样多的人都在等着套管提引器，这问题还是要解决啊。”
    这时候站在王守义旁边的人也忍不住发言了。他们说：“王队长，问题还是要解决。”
    王守义这才勉强回到队部去。做好提引器，已经到了上午十点钟，工人才上班去。
    天，老下雨，洪水正陆续上涨。滔滔的江水已经差不多和堤岸平立，因为眼看着洪水要来了，地质钻探队的人奉命迁移到高地去。材料室的同志们被留下来看守仓库。
    他们的仓库，紧靠江边。千万个水头从地上冒出来。长江的水已经在有些地方溢过来了。
    库内堆存着各种各样的材料，有的材料，既不能碰水，也不能震动。他们把砖头、木箱垫起一公尺高，再在上面铺上木板，然后再把器材搬在木板上面。五天功夫，两个仓库的器材都搬移完毕了。
    水迅速地漫上来。除了他们屋子里有一架电话机和队部保持着联系外，空旷的院子只剩下他们几个人了。
    仓库外面的水已经涨到齐胸脯高，前几天垫起来的砖头，现在最下面的几层，已经被淹没在水里了。
    开始，到饭堂里去吃饭，人们还可以站在两块跳板临时札成的木簰上，用竹竿划过去；现在，有的地方竹竿已经撑不到底，木簰被浪花拍打着，人已经站不稳了。
    材料室的同志们在仓库里睡觉，前几天床腿只有半截被埋在水里；现在是下面搭了一层铺板，然后又在铺板上面安置了床铺。人好像睡在水面上一样。
    人们值班看水，好像是眼看着水在上涨，三小时换一次班，不涨两公寸，也准涨一公寸半。
    本来垫起一公尺高的木板，已经有一半多被淹在水里了。
    他们给队部打电话报告水情，队部在晚上给他们派来一条木船，木船直接驰来停靠在仓库旁边。队部为了怕他们晚上发生危险，要他们夜里都睡在木船上。
    这样，人的安全问题是照顾到了，但材料的安全还没有办法解决。他们请求把材料装在木船上，但当时木船少，一时无法解决。
    正在为难的时候，武汉大桥工程局的杨在田副局长坐了小木船到仓库边上来检查防汛工作。
    他问：“你们坚持得怎么样？”
    “可以。”材料室的同志们说。
    “洪水如果涨到三十公尺，你们能采取什么措施？”
      “我们正碰到困难呢。”孙凤鸣把他们的情形告诉给局长。
    杨局长说：“我们想办法帮助你们解决。”他们停留了一会，小木船又划到别的单位去了。
    就在当天，队部决定白天黑夜专门拨给他们一只木船。后来工程局的材料科还来了三个同志帮助他们搬运材料。
    他们把材料搬到船上不久以后，仓库里本来垫的一公尺高的木板就给大水淹没了。
    他们白天在船上领料发料，木船成了他们的水上仓库；晚上就在船上睡觉，木船成了他们的宿舍。在那些日子里，他们有时彻夜守着数千斤重的铁锚，亲自和搬运工人们抬着它，小心地越过堤岸，从汉口运到汉阳；有时站在江里，推着浮在水面上的空柴油筒，送到岸上。哪怕是一根螺丝钉，或者是一条钢丝绳，都经过他们的千辛万苦才送到工人们的手里。他们和趸船上的钻工一样，就是这样平常地而又顽强地坚持着自己的工作。
