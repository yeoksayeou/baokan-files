Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 31st, TASS dispatch: "Pravda" published an article signed by an observer, entitled "Who is Obstructing the Re-establishment of Good-Neighborly Relations between the Soviet Union and Japan?"

	The observer recalled the joint statement issued by the Soviet and Chinese governments on October 12, 1954, regarding their relations with Japan, and Molotov's statement of December 16, 1954, on the same issue. He pointed out that these two well-known documents had received a wide response in Japan. The Japanese public saw these documents as demonstrating the Soviet Union's peaceful policy and its desire to cooperate with the broad masses of the Japanese people in establishing good-neighborly relations between the two countries.

	Therefore, it is only natural that the news that the Soviet representative in Tokyo and the Japanese Prime Minister held talks on Soviet-Japanese relations in Tokyo on January 25 aroused great attention in Japan. Japanese business circles are hopeful that negotiations on rebuilding normal relations between Japan and the Soviet Union will begin soon.

	However, the facts show that another voice is also heard in Tokyo, a voice clearly tuned to the American key. Some people are using every means to distort the nature of the talks between the Japanese Prime Minister and Domnitsky, the Soviet representative in Tokyo. They are trying to portray this meeting as "negotiations" on various "contentious issues." They are spreading very absurd rumors about the content of these "negotiations."

	The obvious fact is that some American news agencies are carefully collecting and synthesizing all these distorted messages and rushing to spread them around the world. The observer pointed out that the Associated Press is particularly active in this regard. He emphasized that the current campaign of rumor-mongering and distortion is being carried out in accordance with a clear plan formulated by the American diplomatic side to obstruct the normalization of relations between Japan and its closest neighbors. On the other hand, Washington is hinting that Japanese Prime Minister Hatoyama's statement expressing hope for the normalization of Japanese-Soviet relations is merely for electoral considerations.

	Time will tell whether there is any basis for these claims. What is clear at the moment is that an increasingly broad segment of the Japanese public is advocating the normalization of relations with the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China. No matter how the United States and pro-American propagandists may try to confuse and distort this issue, they will not succeed in blinding the Japanese people from seeing the obvious fact that there is every opportunity at present to normalize Japanese-Soviet relations.

    是谁妨碍重建苏联和日本之间的善邻关系
    ——“真理报”观察家的文章的摘要
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科一月三十一日讯：“真理报”刊载了一篇署名观察家写的文章，题目是“是谁妨碍重建苏联和日本之间的善邻关系？”
    观察家追述了在一九五四年十月十二日发表的苏联和中华人民共和国政府关于它们对日本关系的联合声明，以及莫洛托夫在一九五四年十二月十六日就同一问题发表的声明，他指出：这两个尽人皆知的文件已经在日本得到广泛的响应。日本的公众看到这两个文件表现了苏联的和平政策以及它希望和日本广大人士为建立两国间善邻关系的努力相配合的愿望。
    因此，关于苏联驻东京的代表和日本首相于一月二十五日在东京举行苏日关系会谈的消息在日本引起了极大的注意，这是很自然的事。日本的企业界人士都怀有希望，认为不久就要开始进行关于重建日本和苏联间正常关系的谈判。
    然而事实表明，在东京也听到另一种声音，这种声音显然带着美国调。有人在用一切办法来歪曲日本首相和苏联驻东京代表多穆尼茨基所进行的会谈的性质。他们正在努力把这次会谈说成是关于各种“争执问题”的“谈判”。他们正在对这些“谈判”的内容散布非常荒谬的谣言。
    明显的事实是：美国的一些通讯社正在仔细地搜罗和综合所有这些歪曲真相的消息，并且赶快向全世界传布。观察家指出：合众社在这方面特别活跃。他强调指出，目前的造谣和进行歪曲报道的运动，是遵照美国外交方面为了阻挠日本和它最近的邻国的关系正常化所制订的明确计划而进行的。另一方面，华盛顿正在暗示：日本首相鸠山发表的希望日苏关系正常化的声明，只是出于竞选的考虑。
    时间会表明究竟这些说法是否有任何的根据。目前很明显的一点是：日本公众中越来越广大的阶层都主张跟苏联和中华人民共和国的关系正常化。不管美国和亲美的宣传家们可能怎样设法混淆和歪曲这个问题，但是，他们要想蒙蔽日本人民不让他们看到这个明显的事实，即目前有一切机会可以使得日苏关系正常化，那是不会成功的。
