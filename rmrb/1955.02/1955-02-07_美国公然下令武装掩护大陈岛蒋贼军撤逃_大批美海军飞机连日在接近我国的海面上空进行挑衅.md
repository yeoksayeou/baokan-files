Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, February 6th: The United States State Department announced on the 5th that the US government has ordered the Seventh Fleet and other US forces to "assist" the Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops in their retreat from the Dachen Islands and to abduct the residents of the Dachen Islands to Taiwan. This open participation by the US government in the Chiang Kai-shek bandit military operations is a serious crime that infringes upon Chinese sovereignty and interferes in China's internal affairs.

In its statement, the US State Department hypocritically described this measure as "conducive to the restoration of peace and security in the Western Pacific," but a US Navy Department spokesman threatened that "any attack currently underway on the Dachen Islands will be interpreted by the United States as interference with the mission of the Seventh Fleet. Such interference may be met with retaliation from the United States." This fully demonstrates that this measure by the US government harbors a serious plot to provoke a major war.

Sources here point out that this action by the US government to participate in China's civil war is not only a war provocation against the People's Republic of China, but also a major threat to peace in the Far East.

Xinhua News Agency, February 6th: Since January 23rd, when the majority of the US Seventh Fleet successively arrived east and southeast of the Dachen Islands, approaching the East China Sea off our coast, large numbers of US naval aircraft taking off from the aircraft carriers of this fleet have been continuously conducting military provocations over the seas near our country.

According to incomplete statistics from January 24th to February 4th, a total of 496 batches, totaling 2,224 sorties, of US naval aircraft conducted provocative activities in the aforementioned areas.

The continuous provocative activities of US military aircraft are threatening peace and security in China and the Far East. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army is closely watching the development of this situation.

    美国公然下令武装掩护大陈岛蒋贼军撤逃
    大批美海军飞机连日在接近我国的海面上空进行挑衅
    【新华社北京六日讯】　美国国务院五日宣布，美国政府已下令第七舰队和其他美国部队“协助”蒋贼军从大陈岛撤逃和把大陈岛居民劫运到台湾去。美国政府这种公开参与蒋贼的军事行动，是侵犯中国主权、干涉中国内政的严重罪行。
    美国国务院在声明中虚伪地把这一措施说成是“有助于西太平洋和平和安全的恢复”，但美国海军部发言人就扬言，“目前对大陈岛进行的任何进攻都将被美国解释为干涉第七舰队的任务。这种干涉可能遭到美国方面的报复”。这充分表明了美国政府这一措施包藏着挑起大战的严重阴谋。
    此间人士指出：美国政府这一参加中国内战的行动，不但是对中华人民共和国的战争挑衅，而且是对远东和平的重大威胁。
    【新华社六日讯】　美国第七舰队大部舰只从一月二十三日起相继驶抵大陈岛以东及东南接近我国东海海面上以后，从这个舰队的航空母舰上起飞的大批美国海军飞机，连日在接近我国的海面上空连续进行军事挑衅。
    根据一月二十四日到二月四日的不完全统计，在上述地区进行挑衅活动的美国海军飞机共有四百九十六批，二千二百二十四架次。
    美国军用飞机连续进行这种挑衅活动，威胁着中国和远东地区的和平与安全。中国人民和中国人民解放军正密切注视这一形势的发展。
