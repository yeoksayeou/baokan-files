It has been nearly ten years since the Soviet army liberated Lushun-Dalian on August 22, 1945. In these nearly ten years, the people of Lushun-Dalian have established a very deep friendship with the Soviet army. The Soviet army's noble internationalism and patriotism have left a deep impression on the people of Lushun-Dalian.

In those most difficult days immediately after the liberation of Lushun-Dalian, the people of Lushun-Dalian will never forget the brotherly help of the Soviet army. At that time, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, supported by American imperialism, blockaded Lushun-Dalian from land and sea. The Soviet troops stationed in the Lushun area transported tens of thousands of tons of grain and sold it to the people of Lushun-Dalian at low prices; they transported raw materials and fuel to supply factories for production; they organized fishing net factories, solving the employment and livelihood problems of many citizens. In the countryside, when farmers lacked draught animals, the Soviet army allocated a large number of horses to sell to farmers at low prices and voluntarily sent warhorses to plow the land for farmers; when farmers lacked seeds and fertilizers, the Soviet army transported thousands of tons of fertilizer and high-quality seeds; when there was a drought, the Soviet army used trucks to transport water to irrigate the land for farmers; when pests were discovered, the Soviet army used planes to spray medicine to eliminate the pests... In this way, the people of Lushun-Dalian, with the help of the Soviet army, survived the most difficult years. The grain output in the suburbs was only 120,000 tons in 1945, but increased to more than 200,000 tons in 1948. When farmers talked about the reasons for the increased production, they gratefully said: We should first thank the Soviet army for their help in obtaining such a great harvest.

As the days of living together grew longer, the friendship became even deeper. In the Lushun area, one can see the crystallization of this friendship everywhere. In the past, there were very few electric lights in the rural areas here. After the Soviet army came, they allocated a lot of equipment to help install electric lights. Now, almost every village has electric lights. In a village in the suburbs, a Soviet army unit saw the farmers holding meetings in the open air, so they took the initiative to offer to help the farmers build a club. Later, the Soviet army provided many building materials free of charge, and sent many soldiers and dozens of trucks to quickly build a club that could accommodate more than 1,300 people. The Soviet army also trained tractor drivers for the rural areas, and introduced the famous Soviet Bazhirova double-handed cotton picking method to cotton farmers. Using this method of cotton picking can increase work efficiency by one-third.

In the past ten years, no one can say exactly how many Chinese patients the hospitals of the Soviet troops stationed in the Lushun area have treated free of charge. However, many vivid stories are circulating among the people of Lushun-Dalian. Once, a Soviet military doctor, Liebin, in order to save the life of a Chinese student, voluntarily donated 120 grams of fresh blood, saving the student's life. A worker named Zhao Jiafu, who worked in a clothing factory in Lushun, suffered from lung disease due to excessive labor during the Japanese rule. For more than ten years, the lung disease had been bothering him, and he thought it could not be cured. One day, when Zhao Jiafu was working, a Soviet Lieutenant Colonel named Balabili walked up to him, carefully inquired about his condition, and finally said to him: Your lung disease should be cured. Tomorrow, you go to the Soviet Naval Hospital to find me. Zhao Jiafu did not want to trouble the Soviet comrades with his illness, so he did not go the next day. However, the next day, just after the agreed time, Lieutenant Colonel Balabili came. He blamed Zhao Jiafu for not going and said: If you continue like this, it will not only be bad for you but also a loss to the country. The third day, Zhao Jiafu went and was immediately welcomed by Lieutenant Colonel Balabili and other Soviet medical staff. Only then did he realize that Lieutenant Colonel Balabili was the director of this hospital. From that day on, after five months of free treatment at the Soviet Army Hospital, the ulcerated part of Zhao Jiafu's lungs began to calcify.

In the past ten years, the families of the Soviet soldiers have also become close friends and neighbors with the people of Lushun-Dalian. On weekdays, Chinese and Soviet housewives often help each other with household chores and take care of each other's children. Chinese children affectionately call Soviet women "Mama," and Soviet children also call Chinese women "Mama." The family of Soviet officer Stepaneg and the family of farmer Liu Wenhe are among the best neighbors. Liu Wenhe's wife was unwilling to participate in production because she had many children, so Stepaneg's wife took the initiative to take care of her children and introduced her to the situation of Soviet women participating in production, encouraging her to participate in production. Now, Liu Wenhe's wife is already the leader of the women's production team of the agricultural production cooperative.

    同苏军友谊相处的十年
    新华社记者　鲁牧农　张新辰
    从一九四五年八月二十二日苏军解放旅大到现在已经将近十年了。在这近十年里，旅大市人民同苏军建立起了十分深厚的友谊。苏军高尚的国际主义和爱国主义品质，给旅大人民留下了深刻的印象。
    在旅大解放后最初的那些最困难的日子里，旅大人民永远不会忘记苏军兄弟般的帮助。那时候，受着美帝国主义支持的蒋介石匪帮从陆上、海上封锁着旅大。驻旅顺口地区的苏军部队便运来了上万吨的粮食，低价配售给旅大市人民；运来了原料、燃料，供应工厂开工生产；组织渔网工厂，解决了不少市民就业和生活的问题。在农村中，农民耕畜不够，苏军拨出大批马匹低价卖给农民，并主动地派出战马为农民耕地；农民缺少种子和肥料时，苏军又运来了上千吨的肥田粉和优良种子；天旱时苏军用汽车拉水给农民浇地；发现虫害时苏军又用飞机撒药消灭虫灾……。就这样，旅大人民在苏军的帮助下，度过了最困难的岁月。郊区的粮食产量，一九四五年只有十二万吨，一九四八年就增加到二十多万吨。农民们谈起增产的原因时，都感激地说：我们得到这样大丰收，应该首先感谢苏军的帮助。
    相处的日子长了，友谊也更加深起来了。在旅顺口地区，人们到处可以看到这种友谊的结晶。这里的农村，过去电灯很少，苏军来后，拨出了很多器材帮助安装电灯，现在差不多村村都有电灯了。在郊区一个村子里，有一次苏军部队看到农民们在露天地里开会，他们便主动提出要帮助农民修建一个俱乐部。后来苏军无代价地供给了许多建筑材料，并派来许多战士和数十辆卡车，很快地建筑起了一个能容纳一千三百多人的俱乐部。苏军还为农村培养了拖拉机手，为棉农介绍了苏联著名的巴吉罗娃双手摘棉法，用这种方法摘棉可以提高工作效率三分之一。
    近十年来，驻旅顺口地区苏军部队的医院究竟无代价地医治了多少中国病人，谁也说不出一个详细数字来。但是旅大人民中却流传着许多生动的故事。有一次，苏联军医列宾为了抢救一个中国学生的生命，自动输出了一百二十格兰姆的鲜血，挽救了这个学生的生命。在旅顺一个被服厂工作的名叫赵家富的工人，由于在日本统治时代过度的劳累而得了肺病，十多年来肺病老缠着他，他以为治不好了。有一天，赵家富正在工作时，一个名叫巴拉比利的苏军中校走到他面前，细心地询问他的病情，最后对他说：你的肺病应当治好，明天你到苏联海军医院去找我。赵家富不愿让自己的病麻烦苏军同志，第二天他没有去。那知道第二天刚过约定的时间，巴拉比利中校来了，他责备赵家富不应当不去，他说：你这样下去不但对自己不利，也是对国家的损失。第三天赵家富去了，立刻受到巴拉比利中校和其他苏联医务人员的欢迎，他这才明白巴拉比利中校原来是这个医院的院长。从那天起，赵家富的肺病经过苏军医院五个月的免费治疗，肺的溃烂部分开始钙化了。
    近十年来，苏军将士们的家属也和旅大人民结成了亲密的朋友和邻居。平日，中苏两国的家庭主妇们经常互相帮助处理家庭琐事，互相照看孩子，中国的孩子亲热地称苏联妇女为“妈妈”，苏联的孩子也称中国妇女为“妈妈”。苏联军官斯捷潘涅格一家和农民刘文和一家就是最好的邻居之一。刘文和的爱人因孩子多，不愿参加生产，斯捷潘涅格的爱人就主动替她照看孩子，并向她介绍苏联妇女参加生产的情形，鼓励她参加生产。现在，刘文和的爱人已是农业生产合作社的妇女生产小组长了。
