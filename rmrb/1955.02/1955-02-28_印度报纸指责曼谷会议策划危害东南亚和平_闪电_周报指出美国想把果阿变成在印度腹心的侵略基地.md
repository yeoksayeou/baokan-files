Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 27th: Indian newspapers continue to condemn the Manila Treaty nations' Bangkok conference.

　　The Urdu newspaper "New Age" published an editorial on the 26th, stating that the Bangkok conference, under the guise of deceptive words like "defending peace and the democratic way of life," is plotting new conspiracies to endanger peace in Southeast Asia and implement aggressive measures against the freedom of Asian countries. The editorial said, "However, if the imperialist countries really expect that their desire to make Asian countries the victims of their conspiracies will succeed, then they are greatly mistaken. Today's Asia is no longer the Asia of the past. Today, the people of Asia are actively fighting to defend their independence. Their unity against the imperialists is strengthening. Through unity and vigilance, they will undoubtedly defeat the imperialists' war plans."

　　The "Amrita Bazar Patrika" published an editorial on the 25th, exposing Dulles's lies at the Bangkok conference, such as the so-called "the United States' desire to defend Southeast Asia is sincere." The editorial said that, on the contrary, the attitude of the United States is to continue occupying Taiwan and intensify the sabotage of the Geneva Conference's decisions in order to organize new aggressive activities in those places. The editorial said: The nature of the Manila Treaty Organization has been made very clear by Dulles. "This is a completely American trick. Truly important Asian countries have nothing to do with it. The Bangkok conference, without the participation of these Asian countries, can only be a big failure."

　　Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 27th: The Indian "Lightning" Weekly, published on February 26th, said: With the help of the United States, the Portuguese territory of Goa in India is being turned into a "Taiwan" in the heart of India. The "Lightning" Weekly said: Goa's "Dabolim Airport will be further expanded, rubber runways will be built, and radar systems will be installed. Radar equipment, as well as tracked vehicles and road rollers, have already been shipped from the United States. The ambition of the United States is to connect this airport with São Jacinto Island opposite Goa (where a seaplane base has been planned).

　　The weekly reported that an American automobile manufacturing company has obtained a monopoly on building factories in Goa. American companies mining in Angola, Portuguese West Africa, will soon take over all the mines in Goa. These mines have until now been operated by many small local companies. According to available official statistics, Goa's mining companies exported minerals worth 55 million rupees to the United States and Japan in 1953 alone.

　　The weekly also said that Portuguese military commander Brigadier General Faria Pereira has gone to the United States to receive advanced training in strategy. In Goa, a new naval headquarters has been established in addition to the existing military headquarters. Weapons recently shipped to Goa include rocket launchers and flamethrowers, and the ammunition boxes are clearly marked with the words "Given to the Portuguese Army by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization."

    印度报纸指责曼谷会议策划危害东南亚和平
    “闪电”周报指出美国想把果阿变成在印度腹心的侵略基地
    【新华社新德里二十七日电】印度报纸继续谴责马尼拉条约国家曼谷会议。
    乌尔都文报纸“新世纪报”二十六日发表社论说，曼谷会议在“保卫和平和民主的生活方式”之类的骗人话的掩盖下，策划新的阴谋，来危害东南亚的和平，并且实行反对亚洲国家的自由的侵略措施。社论说，“但是，如果帝国主义国家真的期望使亚洲国家成为它们的阴谋的牺牲者的这种愿望会成功，那么它们是大错特错了。今天的亚洲不再是过去的亚洲了。今天，亚洲人民正在积极地为保卫他们的独立而进行战斗。他们反对帝国主义者的团结正在加强。通过团结和警惕，他们将毫无疑问地击败帝国主义者的战争计划。”
    “甘露市场报”二十五日发表社论，揭露杜勒斯在曼谷会议上发表的所谓“美国保卫东南亚的愿望是真诚的”之类的谎言。社论说，相反地，美国的态度是继续占领台湾，并且加紧破坏日内瓦会议的决定，以便在那些地方组织新的侵略活动。社论说：马尼拉条约组织的性质已经被杜勒斯弄得非常明显了。“这是彻头彻尾的美国的把戏。真正重要的亚洲国家同它没有发生任何关系。曼谷会议没有这些亚洲国家的参加，只能是一个大失败。”
    【新华社新德里二十七日电】二月二十六日出版的一期印度“闪电”周报说：在美国的帮助下，葡萄牙在印度的属地果阿正在变成印度腹心中的“台湾”。“闪电”周报说：果阿的“达博林机场将进一步加以扩充，修筑橡胶跑道，装置雷达系统。雷达装备以及履带车和压路机都已经从美国运到了。美国的野心是想把这个机场和果阿对面的桑贾申道岛（在那里已经计划成立水上飞机的基地）连结起来。
    这家周报说，一家美国汽车制造公司已经取得在果阿建立工厂的垄断权。那些在葡属西非的安哥拉采矿的美国公司，不久将接管果阿所有的矿山。这些矿山直到现在一直是由许多当地的规模很小的公司所经营的。据可以得到的官方统计，果阿的采矿公司仅在一九五三年就向美国和日本输出了价值五千五百万卢比的矿产。
    这家周报又说，葡萄牙派遣军司令法里亚·培列拉准将已经前往美国接受战略方面的高级训练。在果阿，除了现有的军事司令部之外，已经建立了新的海军司令部。最近运到果阿的武器有火箭炮和火焰喷射器，军火箱子上明显地标着“北大西洋公约组织赠给葡萄牙军队”的字样。
