The meeting elected the members of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee by secret ballot. Shao Shiping was elected as the Governor of Jiangxi Province; Fang Zhichun, Huang Xian, Rao Sicheng, Li Jieyong, Wang Zhuochao, and Ouyang Wu were elected as Deputy Governors; Wang Dexing, Bai Dongcai, Qiu Zhuo, Zhu Kaiquan, Zhu Danhua, Zhu Xianfang, Li Shangyong, Lu Liang, Hu Delan, Guo Guangzhou, Guo Qingfen, Yuan Chengxian, Huang Lin, Huang Zhizhen, Liang Dashan, Xu Deyuan, Zhang Weihe, Mei Xiaochun, Fu Shigui, Peng Menggeng, Peng Chengwan, Fu Xiaoxian, Yang Shangkui, Yang Weiyi, Deng Hong, Deng Keming, Deng Wenhui, Liao Shaoyi, Liu Junxiu, Liu Jianhua, Liu Wentao, Liu Zhigang, Liu Yifeng, Pan Shiyan, Luo Mengwen, and Xiao Yuanli were elected as members of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee. The meeting elected Zhu Kaiquan as the President of the Jiangxi Provincial Higher People's Court, and elected the Presidents of the Intermediate People's Courts in Nanchang, Ji'an, Gannan, Shangrao, Jiujiang, and Fuzhou six regions.

The meeting listened to the "Report on Conveying the Spirit of the First Session of the First National People's Congress," the "Work Report of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government in 1954," and the "Report on the Preliminary Draft of the Jiangxi Province's 1955 National Economic Plan." The representatives discussed and reviewed these three reports. Shao Shiping, on behalf of the original Jiangxi Provincial People's Government Committee, said in the "Work Report of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government in 1954": Although Jiangxi Province encountered a severe flood unseen in a century and a fairly serious autumn drought in 1954, the implementation of various national economic plans was basically good. The total value of industrial and agricultural production in the province increased by 2.62% compared with 1953. Industrial production overfulfilled the original plan, agricultural production basically maintained the level of 1953, and transportation, trade cooperation, and finance basically completed or overfulfilled the original plan, exceeding the level of 1953. In the speeches of 73 representatives during the discussion of this report, they expressed satisfaction with the work of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government in 1954, especially the great achievements made by the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government in leading and uniting the people of the province to fight against serious natural disasters, and approved the report; at the same time, they also raised criticisms about some shortcomings in the government's work and the undesirable work styles such as bureaucracy, commandism, and detachment from the masses that existed among some state organ staff. The meeting unanimously believed that the "Preliminary Draft of the Jiangxi Province's 1955 National Economic Plan" conformed to the state's general task during the transition period and the requirements of the state's first five-year construction plan, and combined with the specific conditions of Jiangxi Province. The representatives believed that the implementation of this plan would advance Jiangxi Province's socialist construction and socialist transformation, and improve the material and cultural life of the people of Jiangxi Province. In their speeches during the discussion of this draft plan, the representatives also put forward some suggestions for modification and supplementation based on different specific circumstances.

Finally, the meeting also listened to a report on conveying information on current affairs. During the discussion of this report, 16 representatives spoke, expressing great anger at the U.S. imperialism's occupation of China's territory Taiwan and the signing of the so-called "mutual defense treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. They firmly opposed the proposal put forward by New Zealand in the United Nations regarding interference in China's internal affairs, firmly supported the Soviet Union's proposal in the United Nations regarding condemning the U.S. aggression against China, and unanimously expressed that they would strive to strengthen their work in all aspects to support the Chinese People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan.
