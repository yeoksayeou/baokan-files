　　In the fourth quarter of last year, the Supply and Marketing Department of the North China Supply and Marketing Cooperative sent people to rural areas in Northwest China, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, and Shanxi to solicit opinions from farmers and herdsmen on Tianjin's handicraft products. When organizing craftsmen to produce this year's spring and summer goods, they assisted the craftsmen in improving the specifications and quality of the products based on the opinions of the masses. For example, last year, Mongolian herdsmen complained that the raincoats were too small and inconvenient for riding horses; this time, when organizing the processing of raincoats, they specially made more than 6,500 cloak-style raincoats with wide sleeves and long bodies for the herdsmen. Last year, some of the Tianjin-produced towel quilts were not popular with consumers because the colors were not bright and the patterns were not new; this time, before organizing the processing of towel quilts, they found seven types of standard color samples for the craftsmen to refer to and organized them to produce four or five new patterns of colored jacquard, multi-angle flowers, and so on. According to the customs of ethnic minorities in Northwest China, Inner Mongolia, and other places, new shirts made of colored striped yarn, floral linen yarn, and greenish crepe materials have also been organized for production this year.
　　From the beginning of December last year to January 27 this year, this supply and marketing department has signed processing and ordering contracts for the first quarter with more than 40 handicraft production cooperatives, more than 30 handicraft production groups, and more than 260 individual craftsmen in Tianjin. The quantity of this batch of processing orders has increased by two times compared with the same period last year.

    按群众意见准备春夏季商品
    去年第四季度，华北供销合作总社供应经营处曾经派人到西北、内蒙古、河北、山西等地的农村访问，征求了各地农牧民对天津市手工业产品的意见。在组织手工业者生产今年的春夏季商品的时候，他们根据群众的意见协助手工业者改进了产品的规格和质量。如内蒙古牧民去年嫌雨衣号小，穿在身上骑马不方便；这次组织加工雨衣时，就专为牧民做了六千五百多件袖宽、身长的斗篷式的雨衣。去年天津生产的毛巾被，有的因为颜色不鲜艳、花样不新颖，消费者不欢迎；这次组织加工毛巾被以前，找了七种类型的标准色样给手工业者参考，组织他们生产彩色提花、多角花等四、五种新花样的毛巾被。根据西北、内蒙古等地少数民族的风俗习惯，今年还新组织生产了彩条纱、花麻纱、碧色绉等料子的衬衫。
    从去年十二月初到今年一月二十七日，这个供应经营处已经同天津市的四十多个手工业生产合作社、三十多个手工业生产小组和二百六十多户个体手工业者签订了第一季度的加工订货合同。这批加工订货的数量比去年同时期增加两倍。
