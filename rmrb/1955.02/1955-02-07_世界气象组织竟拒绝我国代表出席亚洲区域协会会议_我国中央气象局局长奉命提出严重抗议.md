    World Meteorological Organization actually refuses Chinese representatives to attend Asian Regional Association meeting.
    Director of China Meteorological Administration ordered to lodge a strong protest

    [Xinhua News Agency, 6th] Tu Changwang, Director of the China Meteorological Administration, sent a telegram to Mr. Swoboda, Acting Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization in Geneva, on the 6th, strongly protesting the organization's refusal to accept representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend the first session of the World Meteorological Organization's Regional Association I for Asia, held in Delhi on February 2nd, and its allowing the so-called "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang, who have been spurned by the Chinese people, to attend this meeting.

    Prior to the opening of the first session of the World Meteorological Organization's Regional Association I for Asia, Tu Changwang, Director of the China Meteorological Administration, had sent a telegram to the President of the World Meteorological Organization's Regional Association I for Asia on January 26th, notifying him that the China Meteorological Administration had decided to join the World Meteorological Organization's Regional Association I for Asia and was preparing to attend its first session. On the 3rd, when the meeting was conducting a credentials review, the Soviet delegation again requested the expulsion of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and suggested accepting the People's Republic of China as a member of the association. However, the chairman of the meeting unreasonably ruled that the Soviet proposal to accept the People's Republic of China as a member of the association would not be discussed for the time being, and the meeting passed a proposal allowing Chiang Kai-shek elements to participate in the meeting as so-called observers. When the latter proposal was voted on, the Soviet Union and India voted against it. The full text of Tu Changwang's protest telegram to Swoboda is as follows: "Mr. Swoboda, Acting Secretary-General of the World Meteorological Organization in Geneva:
    Your telegram of January 29th has been received. The World Meteorological Organization has allowed the so-called "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang, who have been spurned by the Chinese people, to attend the first session of the World Meteorological Organization's Regional Association I for Asia, while refusing to accept representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the aforementioned meeting. This practice is completely illegal and unjust. In response to this, I have been ordered by the Government of the People's Republic of China to lodge a strong protest.
    The Government of People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the 600 million Chinese people. The so-called 'representatives' of the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang do not have any qualifications to participate in the World Meteorological Organization and its regional bodies. We demand that the World Meteorological Organization and Regional Association I for Asia immediately expel the so-called 'representatives' of the Chiang Kai-shek Kuomintang in order to accept the participation of representatives of the People's Republic of China.
    A copy of this telegram has been sent to Mr. Basu, President of the World Meteorological Organization's Regional Association I for Asia.
    China Meteorological Administration
                      Director Tu Changwang
    February 6, 1955, Beijing"

    世界气象组织竟拒绝我国代表出席亚洲区域协会会议
    我国中央气象局局长奉命提出严重抗议
    【新华社六日讯】　中华人民共和国中央气象局局长涂长望六日致电日内瓦世界气象组织代理秘书长斯渥波达，严重抗议该组织拒不接受中华人民共和国的代表参加二月二日在德里举行的世界气象组织亚洲区域协会第一届会议，并容许为中国人民所唾弃了的蒋介石国民党的所谓“代表”出席这一会议。
    在世界气象组织亚洲区域协会第一届会议开幕以前，中华人民共和国中央气象局局长涂长望曾经在一月二十六日致电世界气象组织亚洲区域协会主席，通知他中华人民共和国中央气象局已经决定加入世界气象组织亚洲区域协会，并且准备出席它的第一届会议。在三日该会议进行资格审查时，苏联代表团又要求把蒋介石卖国集团分子驱逐出去，并且建议接纳中华人民共和国为这个协会的会员。但是，会议主席竟无理裁决暂不讨论苏联提出的接纳中华人民共和国为协会会员的建议，并且使会议通过了容许蒋介石分子以所谓观察员资格参加会议的建议。在表决后一建议时，苏联和印度投反对票。涂长望给斯渥波达的抗议电全文如下：“日内瓦世界气象组织代理秘书长斯渥波达先生：
    你的一月二十九日来电收到。世界气象组织竟容许为中国人民所唾弃了的蒋介石国民党的所谓‘代表’出席世界气象组织亚洲区域协会第一届会议，而拒不接受中华人民共和国的代表参加上述会议，这种做法是完全非法的、不公正的。对此，我奉中华人民共和国政府之命提出严重抗议。
    中华人民共和国政府是代表六万万中国人民的唯一合法政府。蒋介石国民党的所谓‘代表’没有任何资格参加世界气象组织和它的区域机构。我们要求世界气象组织和亚洲区域协会立即将蒋介石国民党的所谓‘代表’驱逐出去，以便接受中华人民共和国代表参加。
    本电已抄致世界气象组织亚洲区域协会主席巴苏先生。
    中华人民共和国中央气象局
                      局长  涂长望
    一九五五年二月六日于北京”
