The great "March 8th" International Women's Day is approaching. This year, the political tasks for democratic women's federations across the country in organizing women to commemorate "March 8th" International Women's Day are glorious and significant:

(1) Further mobilize women nationwide and the entire nation to resolutely oppose the U.S.-Chiang treaty and actively support the Chinese People's Liberation Army with practical actions to liberate our territory, Taiwan. This is the sacred responsibility of the Chinese people to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and to defend peace in the Far East and the world. Chinese women must unite even more closely with peace-loving women around the world, resolutely oppose the U.S. government's open intensification of military actions and war provocations, its scheming of the so-called "ceasefire" trick, its blatant interference in China's internal affairs, its carving up of Chinese territory, its creation of international tension, and its evil conspiracy to prepare for atomic war. We must unite our efforts to support the World Peace Council's appeal to the people of the world to oppose the use of atomic weapons and the waging of atomic war, and mobilize women to actively sign the World Peace Council Standing Committee's letter to the people of the world. We warmly support the Soviet Council of Ministers' statement on promoting the peaceful use of atomic energy and providing scientific, technical, and industrial assistance to our country and other countries. We warmly respond to the call of the Women's International Democratic Federation to convene the World Mothers' Congress this summer, to expand the international women's movement against war, to defend peace, defend women's rights, and defend children.

(2) Continue to vigorously mobilize women nationwide and the entire nation to contribute their strength to fulfilling and overfulfilling the 1955 national construction plan. To this end, women should be further educated to unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party, to continue to raise socialist consciousness, to recognize the unity of individual, collective, and national interests, to love labor, to cherish public property, and to work harder to improve their production and work capabilities, and under the leadership of the Communist Party, to play a greater positive and creative role in the country's various socialist construction and socialist transformation endeavors. In cities, women in all walks of life should be educated and guided to continue to improve their political awareness and professional skills, and to actively produce and work in their respective positions, in accordance with their unit's production or work plan, and to study diligently. The broad masses of women in families, family members of workers and staff, and family members of handicraft workers should be called upon to actively support production and construction from the family front, to manage household affairs well, and to strengthen unity and mutual assistance, so as to ensure the attendance of workers and staff and handicraft workers.

　　In rural areas, women should be guided to unite with the broad masses of peasants to continue to consolidate and develop the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and to correctly implement the Party's class policy in rural areas during the transition period. We must be good at using typical examples of well-run agricultural producers' cooperatives in the region to explain to women that participating in agricultural producers' cooperatives can increase production, improve living standards, and improve women's family and social status, thereby encouraging women to more actively support and participate in the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement. Rural women should, together with all peasants, enthusiastically engage in spring plowing and production, strive for a bumper harvest of grain, cotton, oil crops, and other cash crops in 1955, and fulfill and overfulfill this year's agricultural production tasks. In areas affected by disasters last year, women should be educated to continue to participate in the production and disaster relief movement, overcome difficulties, prevent spring famine, and restore and develop agricultural production.

　　Among women cadres in state organs and intellectual women, political and ideological education should be strengthened according to different specific situations. Women cadres should be called upon to love their work, study hard, and do their jobs well. The broad masses of intellectual women and female students should be called upon to constantly transform their thinking, improve their socialist consciousness, learn and master science and technology, and exercise their bodies, so as to better participate in and prepare to participate in national construction.

(3) In conjunction with socialist ideological education, continue to publicize and implement the Marriage Law. Because marriage and family issues are related to the production, work, and daily life of the broad masses of people, and because the publicity and implementation of the Marriage Law is a long-term task, feudal remnants of thought and bourgeois marriage views still widely exist to varying degrees throughout the country on marriage and family issues, and affect the marriage and family life of working people to varying degrees. Therefore, when commemorating "March 8th" International Women's Day this year, it is necessary to further educate the broad masses of people to treat marriage and family issues with socialist ideological principles, advocate interpersonal relationships that conform to socialist moral principles, and advocate equal, voluntary, mutual respect, mutual love, and democratic and harmonious new families. This plays an important role in encouraging the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people in production and work. Continue to criticize the feudal remnants of thought and bourgeois thought of valuing men over women and playing with women. First of all, personnel of state organs are required to become models of abiding by the Constitution and implementing the Marriage Law, and should firmly establish socialist moral qualities in dealing with marriage, family, mothers, and children, as role models for the masses. Ideological behaviors that violate laws and discipline and are corrupt and degenerate on marriage and family issues should be seriously criticized and educated. To this end, women's federations at all levels should promote the organs, schools, and industrial and mining enterprises in their respective regions to focus on the education of socialist moral qualities when carrying out "March 8th" commemorative activities, and may request the responsible comrades of the respective units to give reports on these issues to all staff.

　　Local women's federations should, under the leadership of the local Party committee, formulate specific commemoration methods and propaganda points together with relevant parties based on the actual local situation, divide the labor, cooperate, and implement them. In large and medium-sized cities, in addition to holding representative women's commemorative conferences, small-scale commemorative activities should generally be promoted, so as to carry out in-depth publicity and education work according to the current local situation and the ideological situation of the masses of women. In suburban areas of industrial cities and areas with basic construction projects, worker-peasant women's gatherings can be organized in a planned and prepared manner. In rural areas, small-scale commemorative activities can be flexibly organized under the principle of not affecting spring plowing and being conducive to production. In cities where women from the Soviet Union, People's Democratic countries, and other countries reside, local women's federations should take appropriate measures to invite them to hold get-togethers to further enhance mutual friendship and unity.

    中华全国民主妇女联合会
　　关于纪念一九五五年“三八”国际妇女节给各级民主妇联的通知
    伟大的“三八”国际妇女节就要到来了，今年全国各地民主妇联组织妇女群众纪念“三八”国际妇女节的政治任务是光荣而重大的：
    （一）进一步动员全国妇女和全国人民一起，坚决反对美蒋条约，用实际行动积极支援中国人民解放军，解放我国的领土台湾。这是我国人民保障国家的主权和领土完整，保卫远东和世界和平的神圣责任。我国妇女要和全世界爱好和平的妇女更加紧密地团结起来，坚决反对美国政府公开加紧军事行动和战争挑衅，策动所谓“停火”的诡计，蛮横地干涉中国内政，割裂中国领土，制造国际紧张局势，准备原子战争的罪恶阴谋。我们要一致努力支持世界和平理事会向全世界人民发出反对使用原子武器进行原子战争的号召，发动广大妇女踊跃在世界和平理事会常委会告全世界人民书上签名。热烈拥护苏联部长会议关于促进原子能和平用途及给予我国和其他国家以科学、技术和工业帮助的声明。热烈响应国际民主妇女联合会倡议在今年夏季召开的世界母亲大会的号召，以扩大国际妇女反对战争、保卫和平、保卫妇女权利、保卫儿童的运动。
      （二）要继续用大力动员全国妇女和全国人民一起，为完成和超额完成一九五五年的国家建设计划而贡献自己的力量。为此，应更进一步教育妇女更紧密地团结在中国共产党的周围，继续提高社会主义觉悟，认识个人利益、集体利益、国家利益的一致性，热爱劳动，爱护公共财物，更加努力提高生产与工作的能力，在共产党的领导下，在国家的各项社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业中，发挥更大的积极性和创造性。在城市，要教育和引导各行各业的妇女，继续提高政治觉悟与业务水平，在各自的岗位上，按照本单位的生产或工作计划，积极生产和工作，努力学习。要号召广大家庭中的妇女、职工家属及手工业者家属们，应从家庭方面积极支援生产建设，管好家务，加强团结互助，以保证职工及手工业者的出勤。
　　在农村，要引导妇女和广大农民群众团结一起，继续巩固和发展互助合作运动，正确贯彻过渡时期党在农村中的阶级政策。要善于通过本地区办得好的农业生产合作社的典型事例，向妇女群众说明：参加农业生产合作社，可以增加生产，改善生活，提高妇女的家庭地位和社会地位，从而鼓舞妇女更加积极拥护和参加农业互助合作运动。农村妇女应和全体农民一起，热烈地投入春耕生产，争取一九五五年粮食、棉花、油料和其他经济作物的丰收，完成和超额完成今年的农业生产任务。在去年受灾地区，要教育妇女继续参加生产救灾运动，克服困难，防备春荒，恢复和发展农业生产。
    在国家机关的妇女干部中，知识分子妇女中，要根据不同的具体情况，加强政治思想教育。号召妇女干部，热爱自己的工作，努力学习，做好工作；号召广大知识妇女们、女学生们，不断地改造思想，提高社会主义觉悟，学习和掌握科学技术，锻炼身体，更好地参加和准备参加祖国建设。　　（三）要结合社会主义思想教育，继续宣传和贯彻婚姻法。由于婚姻、家庭问题关系到广大人民的生产、工作和日常生活，由于宣传和贯彻婚姻法是一项长期的工作任务，目前全国各地在婚姻家庭问题上还普遍地不同程度地存在着封建残余思想和资产阶级的婚姻观点，并不同程度地影响着劳动人民的婚姻和家庭生活。所以在今年纪念“三八”国际妇女节的时候，要进一步向广大群众进行以社会主义思想原则对待婚姻和家庭问题的教育，提倡人与人之间的符合于社会主义道德原则的关系，提倡男女平等、婚姻自主的夫妻关系和互敬互爱、共同劳动的民主和睦的新家庭。这对于鼓舞广大人民的生产和工作的积极性方面有着重要的作用。继续批判重男轻女和玩弄妇女的封建残余思想和资产阶级思想。首先要求国家机关工作人员，应成为遵守宪法、贯彻执行婚姻法的模范，在对待婚姻、家庭、母亲和儿童的问题上，应巩固地树立社会主义道德品质，作为群众的表率。对于那些在婚姻和家庭问题上违法乱纪、腐化堕落的思想行为，要严肃地进行批评和教育。为此，各级妇联应推动所在地区的机关、学校、工矿企业在进行“三八”节纪念活动时，着重进行社会主义道德品质的教育，并可商请各该单位的负责同志向全体工作人员作有关这些问题的报告。
    各地妇联应在当地党委的领导下，根据当地实际情况，与有关方面共同制定纪念的具体办法及宣传要点，分工合作，贯彻执行。在大、中城市除举行妇女代表性的纪念大会以外，一般应提倡小型纪念活动，以便根据当时当地情况和妇女群众的思想情况，深入宣传教育工作。在工业城市的郊区和有基本建设工程的地区，可有计划、有准备地组织工农妇女联欢。在农村中，可在不影响春耕和有利于生产的原则下，灵活地组织小型纪念活动。在住有苏联、人民民主国家和其他国家妇女的城市，当地妇联组织应采取适当的方式，邀请她们举行联欢，以进一步增进相互间的友谊和团结。
