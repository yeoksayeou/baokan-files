    Xinhua News Agency, London, February 6th: The focus of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference meeting on the morning of February 4th was the situation in Taiwan after the People's Republic of China government's response to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld's telegram.
    On the 3rd, the prime ministers of Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan participating in the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, along with their military advisors, discussed military issues in Southeast Asia. According to Reuters, these issues were discussed in preparation for the Southeast Asia military bloc member states' conference to be held in Bangkok this month.
    It can be seen from newspaper reports that the conference attached great importance to intensifying the war to suppress the Malayan National Liberation Movement in Malaya. United Press International's London correspondent pointed out that the conference discussed proposals to solidify the "ANZAM" organization by treaty; this organization is the original military organization of Britain, Australia and New Zealand, headquartered in Singapore, and its task is to plan military measures related to Malaya.
    According to newspaper reports, Britain firmly demanded that Australia and New Zealand actively participate in the Malayan war. It is reported that Australia and New Zealand expressed their willingness to send troops to Malaya, but refused to undertake definite obligations, and stated that the final decision must be approved by their parliaments.

    英联邦总理会议继续举行
    【新华社六日讯】　据塔斯社伦敦讯：英联邦国家总理会议二月四日上午会议的注意中心，是中华人民共和国政府答复联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德电报之后的台湾局势。
    三日，参加英联邦国家总理会议的英国、澳大利亚、新西兰和巴基斯坦的总理以及他们的军事顾问讨论了东南亚的军事问题。据路透社消息，讨论这些问题是为了准备本月在曼谷举行东南亚军事集团成员国的会议。
    从报纸的报道中可以知道，会议十分重视在马来亚加紧进行镇压马来亚民族解放运动的战争。合众社驻伦敦记者指出，会议讨论了关于用条约把“澳新马”组织固定起来的建议；这个组织是英国、澳大利亚和新西兰原有的军事组织，总部设在新加坡，它的任务是策划和马来亚有关的军事措施。
    据报纸消息，英国坚决要求澳大利亚和新西兰积极参加马来亚战争。据悉，澳大利亚和新西兰表示愿意派遣军队前往马来亚，但是拒绝承担确切的义务，并且声言最后的决定要它们的议会批准。
