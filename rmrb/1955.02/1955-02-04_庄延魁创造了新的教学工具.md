Zhuang Yankui, a teacher in the Biology Teaching and Research Group of Shenyang No. 6 Middle School, has successfully developed an enlarged microscope daylight projector (provisional name) after long-term research and trial production.

The enlarged microscope daylight projector consists of three parts: a light source, a microscope, a light shield, and a screen device. It uses electric light projection and can also use sunlight projection. The greater and stronger the light source, the clearer the projection. Its magnification is far beyond that of ordinary microscopes. A cross-section of an oleander (willow peach) stem, slightly larger than a grain of millet, is projected onto the screen by the enlarged microscope daylight projector, magnified to the size of a bean cake, and the original red, yellow, blue, and other colors on the section are clearly illuminated.

The successful trial production of the enlarged microscope daylight projector solves the shortcomings of schools having few microscopes, many students, and the inability to observe experiments in detail. It also shortens observation and experiment time. In the past, experiments and observations in the classroom generally took fifteen to twenty minutes. If a class is calculated with fifty-five students, the average observation time for one student is only about twenty seconds. Now, with the same amount of time, the entire class can observe in detail.

During the research process, teacher Zhuang Yankui received continuous encouragement and support from the school's Party and administrative leaders, as well as assistance from other teachers. After he completed the design drawings last year, the school specially vacated a laboratory for him to use for making this machine and allocated more than 8 million yuan from the school's teaching funds to solve the material difficulties in the creative work. The Municipal Education Bureau also gave great support to Zhuang Yankui's creative spirit.

    庄延魁创造了新的教学工具
    沈阳市第六中学生物教研组教员庄延魁，经过长期钻研试制成功扩大显微镜白昼放映机（暂名）。
    扩大显微镜白昼放映机是光源、显微镜和遮光，以及影屏装置等三个部分组成的，它用电光投影，也可以用太阳光投影，光源度数越大、越强，投影就越清晰。它的放大倍数远远超过了一般的显微镜。比小米粒稍大一点的夹竹桃（柳桃）茎的横切片，经扩大显微镜白昼放映机投影在影屏上，放大有一块豆饼大，切片上原有红、黄、蓝等各种彩色，照得很显明。
    扩大显微镜白昼放映机试制成功，解决了学校显微镜少、学生人数多、不能详细观察实验的缺点，同时还缩短了观察和实验时间。过去在课堂上实验和观察一般地需要十五分到二十分钟，如果一班按五十五名学生计算，一个学生的平均观察时间只有二十秒左右，现在用同样时间，全班学生都可以详尽地观察。
    教员庄延魁在钻研过程中，得到了学校党和行政领导的不断鼓励和支持及教师们的帮助，他在去年把设计图纸制成后，学校特地腾出一个试验室，专为他制作这个机器使用，并从学校教学经费中拨出了八十多万元，解决创造工作中的物质困难。市教育局对庄延魁的创造精神，也给予很大的支持。
