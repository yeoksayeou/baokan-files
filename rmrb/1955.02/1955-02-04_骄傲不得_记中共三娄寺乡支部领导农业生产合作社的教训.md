Don't Be Proud
——Lessons Learned from the Communist Party Branch of Sanlousi Township in Leading Agricultural Production Cooperatives
Zhang Faxian, Zhang Jianguo

    Sanlousi is an advanced township in Jieyu County, Shanxi Province. After the land reform, under the leadership of the Party, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Sanlousi Township developed year by year. By the winter of 1953, the township's agricultural production cooperatives had grown from 22 households in 1952 to 113 households, with the remaining farmers also organized into year-round and seasonal mutual aid teams. With the vigorous development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, agricultural production also recovered and developed rapidly. In particular, the wheat harvest in 1954 was unprecedentedly abundant, resulting in the township being awarded the title of Model Township for Wheat Production. The lives of the township's farmers also became increasingly prosperous. During the rule of Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan, out of the 243 households in the village, 139 households worried about their next meal, and at least 53 households lacked half a year's worth of food. After liberation, this situation quickly changed. By 1953, the farmers in this township were no longer threatened by hunger. Except for one family that had a lonely elderly person and lacked labor power, making their life relatively difficult, all other families had surplus grain.

    However, this situation did not encourage the Party branch to work harder to lead the township's farmers to continue to move forward. A few leading cadres became complacent and arrogant. Xiao Zhansheng, the branch secretary, said, "I'm not bragging, our Sanlousi has been praised by the county several times. Even if we don't do well, we won't fall behind." Zhang Zuobin, the vice-chairman of the agricultural production cooperative in charge of political work, had not conducted political and ideological education for the cooperative members before July of last year. Lü Yangzheng, the branch's propaganda committee member, also relaxed propaganda work; the 17 Communist Party members in the agricultural production cooperative had not held a Party meeting for more than half a year. The Party branch completely abandoned its leadership over mutual aid and cooperation. Among the farmers, especially the members of the agricultural cooperative, the ideas of being content with the status quo, seeking comfort, not actively working, and being unwilling to invest in expanding production, and even engaging in speculation, developed. In February and March of last year, cooperative member Lü Jiankang wandered around Xi'an for more than two months, and only worked for more than 30 labor days in the first half of the year. Lü Yuexing, the secretary of the Communist Youth League branch, saw that others could earn more than 50,000 yuan a day by peddling pears in Yu Township, so he also abandoned his work in the cooperative and went into speculation. Lü Bingnan also went to resell livestock, and Zhang Xingsheng sold sweet potatoes. The cooperative members' investment in the agricultural production cooperative was greatly reduced. The labor in the cooperative was also much rougher than before. In the past, each mu of paddy field required ten labor days, and dry land required six; last year, each mu of land only required eight, and dry land required five. The amount of fertilizer applied to cotton fields was also very small, averaging two cartloads less per mu than the previous year. Livestock power was particularly insufficient. At this time, the cooperative actually had only 55 head of livestock capable of cultivating land, with each head having to cultivate an average of 54 mu, exceeding the general livestock cultivation capacity by nearly double (each head cultivates 30 mu). In this way, production was of course not good. Last year, the whole cooperative planted a total of 1,246 mu of cotton. The original plan was to achieve an average of 80 jin (lint cotton) per mu of paddy and dry land, but the result was only 52 jin, which was 13 jin lower per mu than the yield of Lü Yangming's mutual aid team in the same township. Due to the low yield, the income of the cooperative members naturally decreased. In 1953, each labor day was divided into 16,780 yuan, which decreased to 12,000 yuan in 1954; in 1953, each cooperative member's average income was 1,928,000 yuan, which decreased to 1,417,000 yuan in 1954; in 1953, there was not a single household in difficulty in the whole cooperative, but in 1954, there were 21 households lacking four months of food.

    In 1954, when the cotton harvest began, the phenomenon of reduced production was already very obvious. Some Party members reported this phenomenon to the Party branch; however, the branch cadres did not quite believe it. They said, "Even if the cotton is not good, it can't be worse than last year." It was not until the county committee came to the village to inspect the work and urged the branch to conduct an on-the-spot inspection of the cotton growth in the fields that the branch cadres were shocked and realized the seriousness of the problem. Under the urging and assistance of the county committee, the branch strictly reviewed this period of work, carried out ideological struggle within the Party, and each Party member, especially the branch cadres, examined their work based on the Party's policies and identified the main reasons for the cotton production reduction. Xiao Zhansheng, the township Party branch secretary, confessed: "I mistakenly thought that Sanlousi was a famous advanced township and that the masses had a high level of awareness, so even without leadership, production could still be done well. This idea actually means abandoning the Party's leadership over the mutual aid and cooperation movement. If this continues, not only will cotton production decrease, but we will also move towards the capitalist road." Lü Chunlong, a branch committee member, confessed: "Since my commandism style was criticized during the Party rectification, I have become passive. I thought that being a township head and doing a good job in the township would be enough. I adopted an indifferent attitude towards agricultural production cooperatives, and I didn't care if cooperative members didn't go to the fields. But I didn't realize that the central task of the countryside is mutual aid and cooperation, and not caring about agricultural production cooperatives is a violation of the Party's policies." Zhang Zuobin, the vice-chairman in charge of political work, confessed: "I only cared about burying myself in production and abandoned the political and ideological leadership of the cooperative members." After self-examination, discussions were launched at the Party member meeting. Party members put forward many opinions to the branch committee, criticizing the branch committee for having serious arrogance and abandoning political and ideological leadership over agricultural production cooperatives, resulting in reduced cotton production. Finally, a decision was made: to strictly enforce Party organizational life, to list Party members playing an exemplary role in agricultural production cooperatives as one of the specific tasks of Party members, and to include this as one of the inspection contents of Party meetings. The branch should regularly study the thoughts of cooperative members and strengthen political and ideological education for them. After the branch committee and Party members went through ideological rectification and everyone's understanding was unified, they then actively launched work among the cooperative members. On the one hand, with Party members as the core, they united non-Party activists to carry out universal and in-depth propaganda and education work among all cooperative members, explaining that the improvement of life must be subordinate to the development of production; immediate interests must be subordinate to long-term interests; and personal interests must be subordinate to national interests. On the other hand, according to the several erroneous ideas existing among cooperative members, they started from summarizing production, used living people and living events, and carried out mass self-education among cooperative members through recollection, comparison, and accounting. When the cooperative members' meeting was held, the branch secretary Xiao Zhansheng and the chairman Zhang Genhua made serious self-criticisms at the meeting, and then inspired the cooperative members to launch discussions and mutual inspections. When discussing why cotton production decreased and the losses to the country and individuals due to the decrease in production, cooperative member Lü Bairen said, "Before liberation, my brother and I both worked as long-term laborers for the landlord. Because of the hardships of life, my brother sold himself to be a soldier for others; in the twelfth lunar month of 1947, I was also taken away by the Kuomintang army, leaving only a woman and a younger brother under seven years old at home, and life became even more difficult. After liberation, my brother and I both came back and were able to work in peace! But we lacked livestock, seeds, and this and that, so we couldn't do a good job with the crops. The Communist Party really cares about us working people in every way. When we were in difficulty, the government called on us to organize and help each other in production. I joined the mutual aid team in 1950, and life got better year by year. Especially after joining the agricultural production cooperative in 1953, I earned more than 7,980,000 yuan that year, an increase of almost two times compared to my income in 1949. At this time, I thought: I have enough to eat, enough to wear, and enough money, so what else do I want! I thought that I could never suffer from hunger again! In the spring, when we were planting cotton, I didn't say anything, and quietly pulled the donkey to the market and sold it at a low price. I also spent 1,300,000 yuan to buy a dairy goat. The cooperative members gave me opinions, but I ignored them. I thought, 'If it doesn't work, I'll just quit the cooperative! Anyway, I have everything!' But when the dividends were distributed in the autumn, I only got 5,360,000 yuan, 2,620,000 yuan less than last year. Only then did I truly understand the principle that if the big river has no water, the small river will dry up. If I don't invest again, production will decrease next year." Other cooperative members also spoke. Finally, the cooperative members unanimously expressed that they would invest the remaining money to expand reproduction. Everyone unanimously proposed that the agricultural production cooperative should formulate an annual plan for the money needed for production investment each year based on the production development of the cooperative members to ensure abundant production. Based on everyone's opinions, the branch specifically helped the cooperative to formulate a production investment plan for 1955.

    After this series of education, the socialist consciousness of the cooperative members was greatly improved. They understood the harm of taking the capitalist road to themselves, further consolidated the agricultural production cooperative, those who originally had wavering thoughts were now firm, those who were lazy in labor were now working hard, and 92 more farm households signed up to join the cooperative. The labor enthusiasm of the cooperative members was greatly improved. In order to lay a solid foundation for abundant production in 1955, they launched a vigorous autumn plowing production movement and thoroughly deep-plowed all 2,332 mu of autumn land. More than 95 percent of the male and female cooperative members were involved in production. The entire cooperative bought 43 head of livestock, and Lü Bairen's production team alone bought 8 head. Last November, after discussion at the cooperative members' meeting, a production plan for this winter and next spring was formulated, deciding to use wheat bran and sorghum stalks to make fertilizer, and strive to apply three large carts of base fertilizer per mu of cotton field in 1955. They also wanted to repair waterwheels and turn 250 mu of dry land into paddy fields, and signed a contract with the supply and marketing cooperative to buy fertilizer. In addition to living expenses, the cooperative members used the remaining 200 million yuan from the sale of cotton as production investment.

    骄傲不得
    ——记中共三娄寺乡支部领导农业生产合作社的教训
    张发贤　张建国
    三娄寺是山西省解虞县的先进乡。土地改革以后，在党的领导下，三娄寺乡的互助合作运动，年年有发展，到一九五三年冬天，这乡的农业生产合作社就由一九五二年的二十二户发展到一百一十三户，其余的农户也都组织在常年和季节性的互助组里。随着互助合作运动的蓬勃发展，农业生产也在迅速恢复和发展。特别是一九五四年的小麦获得了空前的丰收，因而得到了小麦丰产模范乡的称号。全乡农民的生活也日益富裕起来。在蒋阎统治时期，全村二百四十三户里边，就有一百三十九户吃了上顿愁下顿；有五十三户最少要缺少半年口粮。解放后这种情况很快地起了变化，到一九五三年，这个乡的农民就再不受饥饿的威胁了。全乡除一家因为是孤寡缺乏劳动能力、生活比较困难外，其余家家都有余粮。
    但是这种情况并没有鼓励党支部更加努力领导全乡农民继续前进，少数领导干部却因此骄傲自满起来。支部书记萧占胜说：“不是吹，咱三娄寺几次得到县上表扬，就是搞不好也落不了后。”农业生产合作社负责政治工作的副社长张作斌，在去年七月份以前没有对社员进行政治思想教育。支部宣传委员吕仰正也放松了宣传工作；农业生产合作社里的十七个共产党员，有半年多没开过党的会议。党支部完全放弃了对互助合作的领导。农民中特别是农业社社员中的满足现状，贪图享受，不积极劳动，不愿投资扩大生产，甚至作投机买卖的思想就有了发展。去年二、三月里，社员吕健康就去西安逛荡了两个多月，上半年只做了三十多个劳动日。青年团分支部书记吕月星，看到别人跑虞乡镇贩梨，一天就能赚五万多元，他也撂下社里的活，去搞投机买卖。吕炳南也去倒贩牲口，张星升贩卖红薯。社员对农业生产合作社的投资却大大减少。社里的劳动也比前粗糙得多，前年每亩水地用十个劳动日，旱地用六个；去年每亩地只用了八个，旱地用五个。棉花地的施肥量也非常少，每亩平均就比前年少上两车圈粪。畜力尤其显得不足，这时社里实际能耕地的牲口只有五十五头，每头平均得耕地五十四亩，超过一般畜耕能力将近一倍（每头耕三十亩）。这样，生产当然搞不好，去年全社共种棉花一千二百四十六亩，原订计划水旱地每亩平均要达八十斤（皮棉），结果只收五十二斤，比本乡吕仰明互助组的产量每亩要低十三斤。产量低，社员们的收入自然也就减少。一九五三年每个劳动日分红一万六千七百八十元，一九五四年减少到一万二千元；一九五三年每个社员平均收入一百九十二万八千元，一九五四年减到一百四十一万七千元；一九五三年全社没有一个困难户，一九五四年就有二十一户缺四个月口粮。
    一九五四年，棉花开始收获的时候，本来减产现象已很明显。有些党员就把这种现象反映给党支部；但是支部干部还不太相信，他们说：“棉花再不好还能不如去年。”直到县委来村里检查工作，督促支部到地里实地检查棉花生长情况，支部干部才大吃一惊，认识到问题的严重。在县委的督促和帮助下，支部严格地检查了这一段的工作，在党内开展了思想斗争，每个党员特别是支部的干部，都根据党的政策检查了自己的工作，找出了棉花减产的主要原因。乡支部书记萧占胜检讨说：“我错误地认为三娄寺是赫赫有名的先进乡，群众觉悟高，就是不领导，生产一样能搞好。这种想法实际上就是放弃了党对互助合作运动的领导，这样发展下去，不仅棉花要减产，还会走到资本主义道路上去。”支部委员吕春龙检讨说：“自从整党中批评了我的强迫命令作风后，我就消极起来，我想咱当个乡长，把乡里工作搞好就行。对农业生产合作社采取不理的态度，社员不下地，我也不管。可就没认识到：农村的中心工作就是互助合作，不管农业生产合作社，就是违背了党的政策。”担任政治工作的副社长张作斌检讨说：“我只顾个人埋头生产，放弃了对社员的政治思想领导。”经过自我检查后，又在党员大会上展开了讨论，党员给支部委员会提出了很多意见，批评支部委员会有严重的骄傲情绪，对农业生产合作社放弃政治思想领导，造成棉花减产。最后作出决定：严格党的组织生活，要把党员在农业生产合作社中起模范作用，列为党员具体任务之一，并把这作为党的会议的检查内容之一。支部要定期研究社员思想，加强对社员的政治思想教育。支部委员会和党员经过思想整顿，大家认识统一之后，接着又在社员中积极展开工作，一方面以党员为核心，团结非党积极分子，向全体社员进行普遍而深入的宣传教育工作，说明生活改善，必须服从生产的发展；眼前利益必须服从长远利益；个人利益必须服从国家利益的道理。一方面根据社员存在的几种错误思想，从总结生产入手，运用活人活事，通过回忆、对比、算账，在社员中展开讨论，进行群众性的自我教育。召开社员大会的时候，支部书记萧占胜、社长张根华在会上作了严肃的自我检讨，接着启发社员展开讨论，相互检查。当讨论到棉花为什么会减产，减产对国家、对个人的损失时，社员吕百忍说：“解放前我兄弟俩都给地主当长工，因为生活逼迫，弟弟卖身替人家当兵去了；一九四七年腊月我也被国民党军队拉走了，家里只留下个女人和不满七岁的弟弟，生活越发困难。解放后兄弟俩都回来了，也能安心生产啦！可就是缺牲口、少种籽、有这没那的，庄稼做不好。共产党真是处处关心咱劳动人，正在作难的时候，政府号召我们组织起来，互助生产。我就在一九五○年参加了互助组，生活一年一年地好起来了，特别是一九五三年参加了农业生产合作社以后，当年就收入了七百九十八万多元，比一九四九年的收入差不多增加了两倍。这时我就想：要吃有吃，要穿有穿，要钱有钱，还想啥哩！心想怎么也受不了饥饿啦！春天正在种棉花时候，我没吭声，就悄悄地把驴拉到集上贱价给卖了。又花一百三十万元买了一只乳羊，社员给我提意见，我也不理。我想‘要是不行就干脆拉倒，退社吧！反正什么也有啦！’可是到秋后分红，只分了五百三十六万元，比去年少分二百六十二万元。这我才真正明白了大河没水小河干的道理，再不投资，明年还会减产哩。”其他社员也都说了话。最后社员们一致表示：要把剩余的钱，投资扩大再生产。大家一致提出：农业生产合作社要根据社员生产发展情况，将每年需要投资生产的钱，制订出全年计划，保证丰产。支部根据大家意见，具体帮助社里订出一九五五年生产投资计划。
    经过这一系列的教育，社员的社会主义觉悟大大提高了，懂得了走资本主义道路对自己的危害，进一步巩固了农业生产合作社，原来思想动摇的现在坚定了，劳动松弛的现在紧张起来了，并有九十二户农民报名入了社。社员们的劳动情绪大大提高了，为了给一九五五年丰产奠定巩固基础，掀起了轰轰烈烈的秋耕生产运动，把二千三百三十二亩秋地，普遍深耕了一遍。百分之九十五以上的男女社员，都投入了生产。全社共买了四十三头牲口，只吕百忍一个生产队就买了八头。去年十一月间，又经社员大会讨论，订出了去冬今春的生产计划，决定用麦糠、高粱杆沤肥，争取一九五五年每亩棉田施底肥三大车。还要修水车，变旱田二百五十亩为水田，并和供销社订立了买肥料的合同。社员把售棉款除了生活费用外，余下的二亿元作生产投资。
