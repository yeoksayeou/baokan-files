Criticizing Several Erroneous Viewpoints in Works on Planned National Economy
Li Yuheng

The planned national economy is a science with distinct Party character. Lenin called the Soviet national economic plan the second Party program. The national economic plan is a powerful weapon for the Party to build socialism and communism, and all the Party and state's economic policies are specifically embodied in the national economic plan. This essence of the national economic plan determines that all discussions on planned national economy should have a high degree of ideology and political character, and no bourgeois viewpoints are allowed. However, in the works on planned national economy published in the last two years, there have been many erroneous viewpoints, among which the more obvious ones are roughly the following.

In his book "Planned and Proportionate Development of the National Economy," Wu Jingchao argues that international trade can directly change the proportional relationship between industry and agriculture. He said: "Suppose the total production value of a country in a certain period is one hundred, of which the output value of industry and agriculture each accounts for half, that is, industry accounts for fifty and agriculture also accounts for fifty. Suppose further that this country exports ten out of the fifty agricultural products and exchanges them for industrial products worth also ten. As a result, the proportion of industry and agriculture finally formed due to international trade is different from the proportion of industry and agriculture originally formed by production. The original agriculture accounted for fifty, now only accounts for forty; the original industry only accounted for fifty, now accounts for sixty." This is a fundamental error. As everyone knows, international trade can affect the proportional relationship between industry and agriculture. This means that foreign trade adapts the monetary funds in capital construction to material resources and increases the proportion of industrial production in the entire national economy production through industrial capital construction, thereby changing the proportional relationship between industry and agriculture, rather than that international trade can directly change the proportional relationship between industry and agriculture. According to Wu Jingchao's statement, the following conclusion cannot be avoided: as long as agriculture is developed, the country can also be industrialized. Because as long as agricultural products are exported in exchange for industrial products, the proportion of the total value of industrial production can also be increased. Moreover, according to the author's statement on the standards of industrialized countries in the same book, that is, believing that a country can be regarded as industrialized as long as the proportion of its industry reaches about 70%, if international trade can directly change the proportion of industry and agriculture and directly increase the proportion of industry, then our country only needs to develop agriculture, only needs to export agricultural products in exchange for industrial products, and industrialization can be completed quickly! This is a very harmful statement. Although the selfless assistance of the great Soviet Union and the rapid development of economic relations between the countries of the democratic camp are playing an extremely important role in our country's economic construction; however, the basic principle that our country's industrialization cannot rely on international trade to solve is still unchanged.

In his book "Principles of Socialist National Economic Planning" (revised edition in 1953, distributed by Xinhua Bookstore), Luo Zhongyan also holds bourgeois viewpoints in his discussion of one of the basic problems of national economic planning—the compilation method of national economic planning (the balance method). When discussing "Plans and National Economic Balance Sheets," Luo Zhongyan said: "The previously discussed regional balance problem belongs to the scope of spatial balance of the national economy; and the process of each economic plan can be regarded as the temporal balance of the national economic plan. The balance discussed here is the convergence of various individual balances, which is the comprehensive balance of the entire national economy." Luo Zhongyan's view of national economic balance is wrong. As everyone knows, the balanced development of the national economy is the objective requirement of the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy. This law requires that the various departments of the national economy and various parts of the social expanded reproduction process—production, distribution, circulation, and consumption, accumulation—develop in a certain proportion, rather than requiring any "spatial balance" and "temporal balance." The regional balance in the national economic plan mainly refers to the rational allocation of regional productive forces, and it refers to the balanced development of the productive forces of various economic regions in proportion under the unified planning of the state plan, rather than some abstract "spatial balance." As for "temporal balance," it is even more illusory and vague. In the various balance work of the Soviet Union and our country's national economic plans, there has never been such a "balance"; the development process of the Soviet Union's previous five-year plans is the process of the proportionate development of social productive forces and various departments of the national economy, and it is not a question of "temporal balance" at all. What exactly is Luo Zhongyan's so-called "economic balance"? We can get a clearer explanation from his other book, "History of the Chinese National Economy" (Volume 2, published by Commercial Press). He wrote in the section "On the Interconversion of Economic Balance":

  "The original economic balance belongs to the hypothetical situation in dynamic economics (that is, the hypothetical state where economic momentum is temporarily static)." From this, we can know that Luo Zhongyan's statement about temporal and spatial balance has a certain theoretical origin. It is based on the "equilibrium theory" of the bourgeois vulgar economics school. This "theory" assumes that the temporarily static state of economic development is the ideal condition for "economic balance," that is, assuming that population, production technology, labor organization, and consumption are all unchanged; their so-called "dynamic economics" refers to the economy that transitions to another equilibrium when the economic equilibrium is disrupted. This "theory" starts from static state, believing that only in static state can there be general laws, while dynamic state is some swing of general laws. This "theory" is completely unscientific, and its method is metaphysical. As everyone knows, the social economy is constantly developing, and there can be no static state at all. "The first characteristic of production is that it will never stay at one point for a long time, but is always in a state of change and development" (Stalin: "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism"). Secondly, their so-called dynamic state only studies quantitative changes but not qualitative changes. This pseudo-scientific theory is welcomed by the bourgeoisie, because they want to use the method of static research to cover up the essence of relative and absolute impoverishment of the proletariat. The "economic equilibrium" theory of this bourgeois vulgar economics school was specifically manifested in the "balance theory" of the Bukharin elements in the history of Soviet planning. They believed that the proportion of industry and agriculture in the Soviet era must conform to the proportion of the Tsarist era, otherwise there would be an imbalance. This "balance theory" is reflected in the method of plan compilation, which is specifically manifested as the static coefficient method; according to this static coefficient method to compile the plan, the proportion of various departments of the national economy will forever remain at the original level, which means that it will forever remain an agricultural country and cannot be transformed into an industrial country, and this is precisely the attempt of the bourgeoisie. Obviously, this economic equilibrium theory has nothing in common with the scientific balance theory based on Marx's theory of expanded reproduction, because the balance we are talking about refers to the balance based on development, the balance in progress, the balance in movement and change, and it refers to the interrelationship between the various departments of the national economy and the production, consumption, and accumulation in the process of expanded reproduction in social and economic development; due to the different political and economic tasks in different periods, the development proportion of each department can be changed, and the leading link can be different. Balance can only be relative, only in a certain period and stage, not absolute. Luo Zhongyan obviously does not understand this balance based on development, and as a result, he confuses it with the bourgeois equilibrium theory, which is completely wrong.

Luo Zhongyan's error is not accidental, but is related to his erroneous understanding of the essence of national economic planning. He believes that the socialist economic plan itself is an economic law, and it is the law of laws among all socialist economic laws. When discussing "The Essence of Economic Plan" in his book "Principles of Socialist National Economic Planning," he wrote: "The socialist economic plan itself has the power of economic law. It is a law based on the application of general socialist economic laws, because all economic categories representing the laws of socialist society regard the economic plan as their essence. ...From this, it can be seen that the essence of the national economic plan is the law of laws of all socialist economic laws." Here, Luo Zhongyan committed two fundamental errors: First, he confused the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy generated on the basis of public ownership of the means of production with the national economic plan formulated by the state. Stalin clearly pointed out in his book "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR": "We must not confuse our annual plans and five-year plans with the objective economic law of planned, proportionate development of the national economy. The law of planned development of the national economy is ... generated on the basis of public ownership of the means of production. ...The law of planned development of the national economy enables our planning agencies to correctly plan social production. However, we must not confuse possibility with reality. ...To turn this possibility into reality, we must study this economic law, we must master it, we must learn to apply it with complete knowledge, we must formulate plans that fully reflect the requirements of this law." Confusing the objective economic law with the national economic plan formulated by the state will make people ignore the objective nature of the economic law, make people mistakenly believe that the state power can arbitrarily create economic laws, thereby ignoring the necessity of consciously grasping and correctly applying economic laws through subjective efforts, which is very harmful to the scientific leadership of the national economy. Second, he regards the socialist economic plan as the "law of laws of all socialist economic laws" and as the essence of "all economic categories representing the laws of socialist society," which shows Luo Zhongyan's ignorance of the basic economic law of socialism. The national economic plan itself does not reflect the purpose and task. In socialist society, the task of planned national economy is determined by the basic economic law of socialism. Stalin also made a detailed explanation on this issue in his book "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR." It can be seen that Luo Zhongyan's argument is a subjective idealist argument that regards objective possibility as reality, which is directly contrary to Stalin's statement. After the publication of the book "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," it is really intolerable to still retain this non-Marxist distortion of the essence of national economic planning.

Another erroneous viewpoint on this issue is the viewpoint of mechanically separating and studying the development speed and proportional relationship in the national economic plan. The book "Principles of National Economic Planning" (Volume 1) compiled collectively by the National Economic Planning Teaching and Research Group of the Department of Economic Planning of the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (published by Shanghai Economic Weekly) writes: "After the political and economic tasks have been determined, and after the direction of national economic development and the development speed of various departments proposed according to the direction have been determined, the national economic plan must also correctly stipulate the proportional relationship between various departments and aspects of the national economy in accordance with the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy." This statement also has a fundamental error. When the development speed of various departments of the national economy has been determined, the proportional relationship of various departments of the national economy cannot be changed. The proportional relationship of each department is stipulated according to the different development speed of each department. Different development speeds are the cause, and different proportional relationships are the result. The author does not understand this causal relationship between development speed and proportional relationship, and does not understand the organic connection between the basic economic law of socialism and the law of planned and proportionate development of the national economy, so he mechanically separates the two basic problems in the national economic plan. The harm of this statement is that it will make people ignore the leading significance of high-speed development of the national economy. This is contrary to the spirit of Lenin and Stalin teaching us to "pay attention to the speed of economic development at all times."

    批判几本有关国民经济计划化著作中的若干错误观点
    李聿恒
    国民经济计划是一门具有显明党性的科学。列宁曾把苏联国民经济计划称为第二个党纲。国民经济计划是党建设社会主义和共产主义的强大武器，党和国家的一切经济政策都具体表现在国民经济计划中。国民经济计划的这一本质决定了一切关于国民经济计划化的论述应该具有高度的思想性和政治性，不允许任何资产阶级观点存在。可是，在最近两年出版的有关国民经济计划化的著作中，出现了不少错误观点，其中比较明显的大致有下列几种。
    吴景超在“有计划按比例的发展国民经济”一书中论述工农业比例时，认为通过国际贸易能够直接改变工农业比例关系。他说：“假定一个国家在某时期内的生产总值为一百，其中工农业产值各半，即工业占五十，农业也占五十。再假定，这个国家在农产品的五十中输出十，换回工业品的价值也等于十。结果，由于国际贸易而最后形成的工农业比例与原来由生产形成的工农业比例就不同了。原来的农业占五十，现在只占四十；原来的工业只占五十，现在则占六十了。”这是一个原则性的错误。大家知道，国际贸易可以影响工农业的比例关系，这是指通过对外贸易使基本建设中的货币资金同实物资源相适应，通过工业的基本建设来提高工业生产在整个国民经济生产中的比重，从而改变工农业的比例关系，而不是说通过对外贸易就能直接改变工农业的比例关系。像吴景超这样一种说法，就不能不得出下列结论：只要发展农业，也可以使国家工业化。因为只要把农产品出口换回工业产品，也就可以提高工业生产总值的比重。并且，根据作者在同书关于工业国标准的说法，即认为只要一国的工业比重达到百分之七十左右就可算是工业化，如果通过对外贸易，可以直接改变工农业的比例关系，可以直接提高工业的比重，那末，我们国家只要发展农业，只要把农产品出口换回工业产品，工业化就能很快地完成了！这是一种十分有害的说法。虽然，伟大苏联的无私援助和民主阵营国家间经济关系的迅速发展，对我国的经济建设都起着极其重大的作用；但是，我们国家的工业化不能依靠国际贸易来解决，这一个基本道理是仍然未变的。
    罗仲言所著“社会主义国民经济计划原理”一书（一九五三年增订版，新华书店经售）在关于国民经济计划的基本问题之一——国民经济计划的编制方法（平衡法）的论述上，也存在着资产阶级观点。罗仲言在论述“计划和国民经济均衡表”时说：“前所论地区均衡问题是属于国民经济底空间均衡范围；而历届经济计划底进程，则可视为国民经济计划底时间均衡。这里所论究的均衡，乃就诸个别均衡而会通之，是为国民经济底全部综合均衡。”罗仲言这种对于国民经济均衡的看法是错误的。大家知道，国民经济的均衡发展，是国民经济有计划按比例发展法则的客观要求，这一法则要求国民经济各部门和社会扩大再生产过程各部分——生产、分配、流通、消费、积累按一定比例来发展，而不要求什么“空间均衡”和“时间均衡”。国民经济计划中的地区均衡，主要是指地区生产力的合理配置，是指各经济区生产力在国家计划统一规划下按比例发展的平衡，而不是什么抽象的“空间均衡”。至于“时间均衡”，那更是虚玄幻渺的东西。在苏联和我国国民经济计划的各种平衡工作中，是从来不存在这样一种“均衡”的；苏联历届五年计划的发展过程，是社会生产力和国民经济各部门按比例发展的过程，而根本不是什么“时间均衡”的问题。罗仲言的所谓“经济均衡”究竟是什么呢？我们可以从他的另一著作“中国国民经济史”（下册，商务印书馆出版）中得到比较明确的解释，他在该书“论经济均衡互变”一节中写道：
  “原经济均衡乃属动态经济中之假定情况（即假定经济动势暂时静止之状态）。”从这里，我们可以知道，罗仲言关于时、空均衡的说法，是有其一定理论根源的，它是以资产阶级庸俗经济学派的“均衡理论”为根据的。这种“理论”假定经济发展的暂时静止状态是“经济均衡”的理想条件，即假定人口、生产技术、劳动组织和消费等都是不变的；他们所谓“动态经济”，是指经济均衡遭受破坏时又过渡到另一种均衡的经济。这种“理论”是从静态出发，认为只有静态中才有一般规律存在，而动态是一般规律的某些摆动。这种“理论”是完全反科学的，其方法是形而上学的。大家知道，社会经济是在不断发展着的，根本不可能有静态存在。“生产底第一个特点就是它永远也不会长久停留在一点上，而是始终处在变更和发展状态中”（斯大林：
  “辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”）。其次，他们的所谓动态是只研究数量变化而不研究质量变化的，这种伪科学理论为资产阶级所欢迎，因为他们正是想用静态研究的方法，来掩盖无产阶级相对和绝对贫穷化的实质。这种资产阶级庸俗经济学派的“经济均衡”理论在苏联计划史上具体表现为布哈林分子的“平衡论”，他们认为苏维埃时代的工农业比例必须符合于沙俄时代的比例，否则就会发生不平衡现象。这种“平衡论”反映在计划的编制方法上，就具体表现为静态系数法；根据这种静态系数法来编制计划，就会使国民经济各部门的比例永远停留在原有水平上，这也就是说，永远保持农业国而不能转变为工业国，而这正是资产阶级的企图。很明显地，这种经济均衡论是同以马克思主义扩大再生产理论为基础的科学的平衡理论没有任何共同之点的，因为我们所说的平衡是指发展基础上的平衡、前进中的平衡、运动变化中的平衡，是指国民经济各部门同扩大再生产过程中生产、消费和积累在社会经济发展中的相互关系；由于不同时期的不同政治经济任务，各部门的发展比例可以改变，主导环节可以不同。平衡只能是相对的，只能是在一定时期一定阶段上的，而非绝对的。罗仲言对于这种基于发展基础上的平衡显然是不理解的，结果把它同资产阶级的均衡理论混为一谈，这是完全错误的。
    罗仲言的这一错误，不是偶然的，而是同他对国民经济计划本质的错误了解相联系的。他认为社会主义经济计划本身就是一种经济法则，并且是社会主义一切经济法则中的法则。他在“社会主义国民经济计划原理”一书中论述“经济计划底本质”时写道：“社会主义经济计划本身就具有经济法则的力量。它是立足在运用一般社会主义经济法则之上的法则，这就是因为一切代表社会主义社会规律性的经济范畴，都是将经济计划作为它们本质的缘故。……由此可知国民经济计划底本质是社会主义一切经济法则中的法则。”在这里，罗仲言犯了两个原则性的错误：第一，他把在生产资料公有制基础上产生的国民经济有计划按比例的发展法则同国家制订的国民经济计划混为一谈。斯大林在“苏联社会主义经济问题”一书中曾明确地指出：“不能把我们的各个年度计划和五年计划跟国民经济有计划发展、按比例发展的客观经济法则混为一谈。国民经济有计划发展的法则，是……在生产资料公有化的基础上产生的。……国民经济有计划发展的法则，使我们的计划机关有可能去正确地计划社会生产。但是，不能把可能同现实混为一谈。……要把这种可能变为现实，就必须研究这个经济法则，必须掌握它，必须学会以完备的知识去应用它，必须制定出能完全反映这个法则的要求的计划。”把客观的经济法则同国家制订的国民经济计划混为一谈，会使人们忽视经济法则的客观性质，使人们错误地认为国家政权能够任意地创造经济法则，从而忽视通过主观努力自觉掌握和正确运用经济法则的必要性，这对于科学地领导国民经济是非常有害的。第二，他把社会主义经济计划当作“社会主义一切经济法则中的法则”，当作“一切代表社会主义社会规律性的经济范畴”的本质，这说明罗仲言对于社会主义基本经济法则的无知。国民经济计划本身不体现目的和任务。在社会主义社会里，国民经济计划化的任务是由社会主义基本经济法则所决定的。关于这个问题，斯大林在“苏联社会主义经济问题”一书中也曾作过详尽的阐明。由此可见，罗仲言的这种论调乃是一种把客观可能当作现实的主观唯心论的论调，它是同斯大林的说法直接相违背的。在“苏联社会主义经济问题”一书出版以后，还居然保留这种非马克思主义的歪曲国民经济计划本质的说法，这实在是不能令人容忍的。
    在这个问题上另一种错误观点，就是把国民经济计划中发展速度同比例关系机械地割裂开来研究的观点。上海财政经济学院经济计划系国民经济计划教研组集体编写的“国民经济计划原理”（上册）一书（上海经济周报社出版）中写道：“在政治经济任务既已确定，在国民经济发展的方向以及根据方向所提出的各部门的发展速度问题既已确定的情况下，国民经济计划还必须依照国民经济有计划按比例发展的法则去正确的规定国民经济各部门与各方面之间的比例关系。”这种讲法同样有着原则性的错误。在国民经济各部门发展速度既已确定的情况下，国民经济各部门的比例关系就不可能改变。各部门比例关系是根据各部门不同的发展速度来规定的，不同的发展速度是原因，不同的比例关系是结果。作者不了解这种发展速度同比例关系之间的因果关系，不了解社会主义基本经济法则同国民经济有计划按比例发展法则之间的有机联系，因此把国民经济计划中的两个基本问题机械地割裂开来了。这种讲法的害处在于它会使人们忽视高速度发展国民经济的主导意义。这是同列宁斯大林教导我们的“时刻注意经济发展速度”的精神相违背的。
