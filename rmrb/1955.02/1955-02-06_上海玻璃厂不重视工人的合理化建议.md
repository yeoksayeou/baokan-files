To the Editor:

Our state-owned Shanghai Glass Factory originally used manual labor for production. In 1953, the factory bought two ampoule-making machines. However, the result of putting these two machines into production was almost the same as manual production, and the reject rate was often above 30 percent, reaching as high as 50 percent at times. In March of last year, Comrade Jiang Shanhong designed a new type of ampoule-making machine. After research by relevant departments, it was unanimously agreed that the design was simple in structure and easy to operate, with an estimated production efficiency more than ten times that of manual labor, and the quality was reliably guaranteed. In April of last year, Comrade Jiang Shanhong formally suggested to the factory leadership that they manufacture the machine according to the new drawings. The leadership initially said that the suggestion was good. Later, Comrade Jiang Shanhong urged them more than ten times, but the leadership ignored him. However, the new machines added to the factory were still the same old ones, with low output and poor quality. We are very dissatisfied with this matter, and Comrade Jiang has unspeakable sadness in his heart. Therefore, Comrade Jiang wrote a wall poster criticizing the factory leadership for not paying attention to the rationalization proposals of the masses, but this manuscript was discovered by the leadership and thus lost its opportunity for publication forever.

In the past, the grinding group in the instrument workshop had to work on two machines with different speeds at the same time, which wasted equipment and reduced work efficiency, which made everyone very anxious. Later, Comrade Shi Luguan of this workshop designed a gearbox that could be used to control the speed of the machines, but the leadership also adopted a bureaucratic attitude towards his proposal. There are many similar examples of this factory not paying attention to and carelessly handling rationalization proposals. The existence of this situation not only dampened the enthusiasm of the masses for innovation, but also caused undue losses to the country.

### 上海玻璃厂不重视工人的合理化建议

    上海玻璃厂不重视工人的合理化建议编辑同志：
    我们国营上海玻璃厂原来都是用手工进行生产的，一九五三年厂里买到了两部安瓿制造机，可是这两部机器投入生产的结果，仍同手工生产差不多，而且废品率经常在百分之三十以上，最高的时候竟达到百分之五十。去年三月，江山宏同志设计了一种新式的安瓿制造机，经过有关方面研究，一致认为这个设计，机器构造简单，操作方便，估计生产效率要超过手工十倍左右，质量也有可靠的保证。去年四月，江山宏同志正式建议工厂领导方面依照新的图样制造机器，领导方面开始也说这个建议很好。后来，江山宏同志连催了十几次，领导方面却置之不理了。但是，工厂里添置的新机器，却仍然是老样子，产量很低，质量仍然很坏。我们对这件事很不满意，江山宏同志心中更有说不出的难过。因此，江同志写了一篇批评工厂领导方面不重视群众合理化建议的墙报稿子，这件稿子却被领导同志知道了，因而便永远失去了发表的机会。
    仪器车间磨砂组过去要同时在两部转速不同的车子上工作，浪费了设备，工作效率又不高，大家很是着急。后来，这个车间的施禄官同志设计了一种变速器，可以用它来指挥车子的快慢，但领导同志对他的建议同样采取了官僚主义的态度。这个工厂不重视和轻率处理合理化建议的类似例子是很多的。这种情况的存在不仅打击了群众创造的积极性，而且也使国家受到了不应有的损失。
