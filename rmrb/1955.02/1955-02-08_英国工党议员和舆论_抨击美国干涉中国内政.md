Xinhua News Agency, London, 7th: British Labour MPs and public opinion continue to criticize the United States' armed interference in China's internal affairs and oppose the British government's support of this U.S. war policy.

Labour MP Bevan told a crowd of two thousand people in Hull, Yorkshire, on the evening of the 6th, "We should make it very clear to the United States that Britain will not sacrifice a single life to return Chiang Kai-shek to China." He added, "We do not think defending Chiang Kai-shek can be said to be defending the free world in the slightest. We do not think the U.S. intervention in Taiwan can be imagined as a collective security action in the slightest."

Bevan reiterated his plan to resolve the Taiwan issue, which includes: the first necessary step towards peace in the Far East is for the United Nations to reject the Chiang Kai-shek "government" and declare the government of the People's Republic of China as the legitimate government; let Chiang Kai-shek "step down and retire," and tell him that the risk of a third world war cannot be taken to satisfy his ambitions. Bevan's plan also includes the so-called "neutralization of Taiwan," which the Chinese people firmly oppose, although he also admits that "this is unfair to the Beijing government."

Crossman, a member of the Labour Party's National Executive Committee and a Member of Parliament, said at the annual meeting of the Labour Party Organization Committee in the West Midlands on the 5th that we should warn the Americans that if they insist on intervening in this matter, they will have to do it alone. The British Conservative government cannot agree to provide military support to the United States, regardless of the unanimous opinion of our labor movement.

Former Labour government Defense Minister Shinwell, speaking in Moreton, Durham County, accused Eden of echoing the American position on the legal status of Taiwan in the House of Commons, and said: "It is less that he (Eden) is showing that he is explaining the actual legal status, but rather that he is single-mindedly appeasing the United States."

The Labour Party's organ, the "Daily Herald," demanded that the British government issue a statement stating that the British people will not interfere in China's civil war. It said, "It is now more necessary than ever for the government to state its position frankly and to no longer encourage the U.S. in such fantasies that two Chinas are acceptable to everyone, because Chiang Kai-shek is purely an American puppet. Yesterday, Chiang Kai-shek threatened to attack, and the United States is accelerating the delivery of jet aircraft to him. This is ridiculous and stupid behavior."

In addition, the "Reynold's News" sharply criticized the United States for interfering in China's internal affairs in an editorial, and demanded that "Churchill explain to the world, especially to the warmongers in the United States, that Britain will not participate in any war to maintain Chiang Kai-shek in Taiwan. No government can involve our country in war in order to deprive China of its right to rule Chinese territory."

### 英国工党议员和舆论  抨击美国干涉中国内政

    英国工党议员和舆论
    抨击美国干涉中国内政
    【新华社七日讯】伦敦消息：英国工党议员和舆论继续抨击美国武装干涉中国内政，并且反对英国政府支持美国这种战争政策。
    工党议员比万六日晚在约克郡赫尔地方对两千名群众说，“我们应该非常清楚地向美国说明：英国不会为了让蒋介石回到中国去而牺牲一条生命。”他又说，“我们不认为保卫蒋介石能丝毫说成是保卫自由世界。我们不认为美国在台湾的干涉能够被丝毫想像为一个集体安全行动。”
    比万重申了他的解决台湾问题的计划，这个计划包括：走向远东和平的第一个必要步骤是联合国拒绝蒋介石“政府”并且宣布中华人民共和国政府是合法政府；让蒋介石“下台退休”，并且告诉他，不能为满足他的野心而冒第三次世界大战的风险。比万的计划还包括中国人民坚决反对的所谓“使台湾中立化”，虽然他也承认“这是对北京政府不公正的事情”。
    工党全国执行委员会委员、议会议员克罗斯曼五日在英国中央各郡西部地区工党组织委员会年会上说，我们应该警告美国人：如果他们一定要插手干预这一事件，他们就得单独去干。英国保守党政府不能不顾我们工人运动的一致的意见而答应对美国作军事上的支持。
    前工党政府的国防大臣辛威尔在达拉谟郡摩顿地方讲话时指责艾登在下院谈台湾法律地位时的附和美国的说法，他并说：“与其说这是表明他（艾登）在解释实际的法律地位，倒不如说他是一心一意姑息美国。”
    工党机关报“每日先驱报”要求英国政府发表声明，说明英国人民将不干预中国内战。它说，“政府现在比以前任何时候更加有必要直率地表明态度，不再鼓励美国这样的幻想：两个中国是可以为大家所接受的。因为蒋介石纯粹是美国的傀儡。昨天蒋介石还威胁着要进攻，美国正加速把喷气飞机交给他。这是荒唐可笑和愚蠢行为。”
    此外，“雷诺新闻”在社论中尖锐地指责美国干涉中国内政，并要求“邱吉尔向全世界、特别是向美国的战争贩子说明，英国不会为了维持台湾的蒋介石而参加任何战争。任何政府不能为了剥夺中国统治中国领土的权利而使我国卷入战争。”
