Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 7th: According to TASS, Max Reimann, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany, published an article in "Freies Volk" discussing the tasks of the German working class in the struggle against the Paris Agreements.

    Reimann said: Workers no longer doubt that if the Paris Agreements are ratified, it will be full of threats to the entire working-class movement in West Germany. Reimann pointed out that people from all strata of West Germany have participated in the struggle against West German militarists, for peace, for German unification and democracy; now there is a deep chasm between the Adenauer government and the vast majority of the German people.

    Reimann pointed out that because the Adenauer government is unwilling to consider the opinions of the people, the working class and all the people should take the initiative and conduct a referendum "to restore German unification in peace and freedom, against the Paris Agreements, against rearmament and conscription." The task of the Communist Party is to launch a vigorous movement against these agreements and for a peaceful settlement of the German question, together with the Social Democratic Party, various trade unions, and all those who oppose the Paris Agreements.

    Reimann called on people from all walks of life to express their firm will to strive for peace and unity and to fight against the Paris Agreements at meetings and rallies, and to firmly demand that members of the Bundestag act in accordance with the national interests of Germany.

    Referring to the Soviet Union's proposals on the German question and Adenauer's reaction to these proposals, Reimann said: The Soviet Union has provided everything necessary for the German people to live in unity, freedom, and peace; now it is up to the federal government and parliament to take action; they must announce what actions they will take to take advantage of this situation which is favorable to all the German people, so that our motherland can be reunited. Reimann then condemned Adenauer's war policy. Reimann said: Adenauer is not trying to seek German unification, he is not looking for ways to reach an agreement, but hopes to drag our people into dangerous adventures and plunge us into new disasters.

    Reimann said: The struggle of the West German people against the Paris Agreements is closely linked to the struggle to defend democratic rights and freedoms. The working class and all peace-loving people of West Germany must be especially vigilant against the conspiracy of the Karlsruhe trial aimed at outlawing the Communist Party of Germany, because the monopoly capitalists and the Adenauer government not only threaten the Communists, but also the trade unions and the entire Social Democratic movement.

    Reimann finally called on the Communists to intensify their struggle to achieve the united action of the working class and launch a large-scale patriotic movement to prevent the ratification of the Paris Agreements, in accordance with the program of the German Communist Party Congress held in Hamburg.

    德国共产党中央委员会第一书记
    雷曼号召西德人民阻止批准巴黎协定
   【新华社七日讯】据塔斯社柏林六日讯：德国共产党中央委员会第一书记马克斯·雷曼在“自由人民报”上著文，论述德国工人阶级在反对巴黎协定斗争中的任务。
    雷曼说：工人们已经不再怀疑，如果巴黎协定被批准将充满对西德整个工人阶级运动的威胁了。雷曼指出：西德各阶层的人民都参加了反对西德军国主义者、争取和平、争取德国统一和民主的斗争；现在阿登纳政府同绝大多数德国人民之间有着一道很深的鸿沟。
    雷曼指出：由于阿登纳政府不愿意考虑人民的意见，工人阶级和全体人民便应该采取主动，进行一个“争取在和平和自由的情况下恢复德国统一、反对巴黎协定、反对重新武装和征兵入伍”的公民投票。共产党的任务就是要同社会民主党、各工会以及所有反对巴黎协定的人一起，发动一个反对这些协定、争取和平解决德国问题的强有力的运动。
    雷曼号召各阶层人民在会议和集会上表示他们争取和平和统一、为反对巴黎协定而斗争的坚定意志，并且坚决要求联邦议院议员们按照德国的民族利益行事。
    雷曼谈到苏联关于德国问题的建议和阿登纳对这些建议的反应时说：苏联已经提供了德国人民在统一、自由和和平的情况下生活所必需的一切，现在应该由联邦政府和议会采取行动了；它们必须宣布它们将采取什么行动来利用这种有利于全德人民的局势，以便使我们祖国重新得到统一。雷曼接着谴责了阿登纳所奉行的战争政策。雷曼说：阿登纳并不设法谋求德国的统一，他并不寻求达成协议的方法，而是希望把我国人民卷入危险的冒险，把我们投入新的灾难。
    雷曼说：西德人民反对巴黎协定的斗争是同保卫民主权利和自由的斗争密切联系着的。西德的工人阶级和全体爱好和平的人民必须格外警惕目的在取缔德国共产党的加尔斯卢合的审讯的阴谋，因为垄断资本家和阿登纳政府不仅威胁着共产党人，而且也威胁着工会和整个社会民主主义运动。
    雷曼最后号召共产党人依照在汉堡举行的德国共产党代表大会的纲领，为实现工人阶级的统一行动、展开大规模的爱国运动以阻止批准巴黎协定而加紧斗争。
