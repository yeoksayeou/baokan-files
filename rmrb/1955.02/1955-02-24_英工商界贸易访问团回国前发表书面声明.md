Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd:

    The British business and trade delegation, after completing trade negotiations in Beijing, left Beijing in batches on February 21st and 22nd, led by delegation leader Lord Rootes and Brocklehurst Whiston Amalgamated's vice chairman and general manager, Blot.

    After arriving in Beijing on February 5th, the delegation conducted trade negotiations separately with China National Import and Export Corporation and various export corporations. After more than ten days of discussions, both parties not only signed specific contracts for many types of import and export commodities but also exchanged opinions on several issues in their trade and achieved satisfactory results, laying a better foundation for the further development of Sino-British trade in the future.
Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd:

    Before leaving Beijing to return home, the British business and trade delegation issued a written statement. The statement first said: "The twenty-four British entrepreneurs who arrived in Beijing on February 5th for trade negotiations today formally concluded their negotiations with China National Import and Export Corporation and various state-owned export corporations. At the end of the twelve days of negotiations, more than one hundred and thirty contracts have been signed, totaling approximately four million pounds, and some transactions are still under negotiation. These transactions will probably be settled in the near future, which will greatly increase the total transaction amount.
      "In addition to the actual transactions in this visit, the delegation has laid a good foundation for future trade between its members and Chinese companies, consolidating the relationship established by some members of the delegation during their first visit to Beijing in June 1953."

    The statement then said: "Shortly after arrival, the companies conducted direct and specific discussions with various Chinese trading companies. Approximately two hundred talks were held in eleven days. These negotiations were conducted quickly and efficiently, and in a sincere atmosphere.
      "Chinese commercial institutions provided full cooperation, making these visits successful. The British delegation deeply felt that all parties concerned sincerely hoped to increase the volume of trade between Britain and China. British entrepreneurs had many opportunities to meet with their Chinese counterparts informally and during trade negotiations. In fact, this visit was characterized by a spirit of friendship and cooperation from beginning to end. Some British entrepreneurs were able to meet with their Chinese technical counterparts and discuss methods."

    The statement concluded: "After this visit, the British delegation is convinced that the Chinese market for British goods is vast. British entrepreneurs believe that the development of Chinese industry and commerce provides the possibility for continuously expanding trade between the two countries, especially in British machinery products and other manufactured goods.
      "The trade volume of machinery products this time is not large, and the Chinese side indicated that contracts could not be signed for commodities whose delivery could not be guaranteed due to the embargo.

    “However, the Chinese side expressed its hope to do business with British machinery manufacturing companies as soon as circumstances permit. They reiterated their previous estimate that once normal conditions are restored, the trade volume between the two countries could soon reach 80 million to 100 million pounds per year. The British delegation does not consider this figure unrealistic.
      "In addition to handling immediate transactions, the delegation also discussed future trade relations. The British delegation and Chinese commercial institutions agreed to maintain closer contact in the future to promote trade between Chinese companies and British companies."

    英工商界贸易访问团回国前发表书面声明
    【新华社二十二日讯】　英国工商界贸易访问团大部分团员在北京完成了贸易谈判后，由团长巴罗赫本和盖尔公司副董事长兼总经理布洛特率领，于二月二十一日、二十二日分批离京。
    访问团从二月五日到达北京后，即与我中国进出口公司及各出口专业公司分别进行了贸易谈判。经过十多天的商谈，双方不仅就许多种进出口商品签订了具体合同，还就彼此贸易中若干问题交换了意见并获得了满意的结果，为今后中英贸易的进一步开展打下了更好的基础。
    【新华社二十二日讯】　英国工商界贸易访问团在离京回国前发表书面声明，声明首先说：“二月五日到达北京进行贸易谈判的二十四位英国企业家，今天正式结束了他们同中国进出口公司和国营各出口公司的谈判。在十二天的谈判结束时，已经签订了一百三十多个合同，总额大约为四百万英镑，还有一些交易仍在谈判中。这些交易大概会在最近将来谈妥，这样，交易总额又将大大增加。
      “除了在这次访问中的实际交易外，代表团还为其成员和中国各公司间今后的贸易奠定了良好的基础，巩固了代表团某些成员一九五三年六月来北京初次访问所建立起来的关系。”
    声明接着说：“在抵达后不久，各公司就同中国各贸易公司进行直接的具体讨论。在十一天中进行了大约二百次谈话。这些谈判进行得迅速有效，而且是在诚挚的气氛中进行的。
      “中国商业机构予以充分的合作，使这些访问得到成功。英国代表团深深感觉到一切有关方面都真诚希望增加英中两国的贸易额。英国企业家得到许多机会同中国企业家非正式地和在交易谈判过程中会晤。事实上，这次访问的特点是自始至终表现的友好和合作精神。一些英国企业家能够同他们的同行的中国技术人员会晤并讨论方法。”
    声明最后说：“经过这次访问以后，英国代表团确信，中国为英国货品提供的市场是广阔的。英国企业家们相信，中国工业和商业的发展为不断扩大两国间的贸易，特别是英国机器制造业产品和其他制成品的贸易提供了可能。
      “这次机器制造业产品的贸易额是不大的，中国方面并表明，在由于禁运而不能保证交货的商品方面，不能签订合同。
    “然而，中国方面表示希望一俟情况许可就同英国机器制造公司做生意。他们再次说明了他们以前的估计：一旦正常的情况恢复，两国间的贸易额很快就能达到每年八千万英镑和一亿英镑的数目。英国代表团并不认为这个数字是不现实的。
    “除了办理眼前的交易以外，代表团还讨论了将来的贸易关系问题。英国代表团和中国各商业机构一致同意在今后保持更加密切的联系，以便促进中国各公司和英国各公司的贸易。”
