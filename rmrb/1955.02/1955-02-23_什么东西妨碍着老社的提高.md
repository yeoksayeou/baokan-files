What Hinders the Improvement of Old Cooperatives
Rural Work Department of the Hongzhao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

From October 22nd to 26th, 1954, the Hongzhao County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Shanxi Province, convened a cadre meeting attended by 162 old cooperative cadres. At this meeting, the mass line method of "everyone as teacher, everyone as student" was used to summarize the achievements and experiences of 162 old cooperatives on the agricultural production front. From the overall results, these old cooperatives have "increased production, stabilized, been well-managed, and expanded." In 1954, these 162 cooperatives planted a total of 18,800 mu of irrigated and dry land cotton fields, producing 1,353,600 jin of ginned cotton, with an average yield of 72 jin per mu. This was an increase of 7 jin per mu compared to the average yield of agricultural cooperatives in 1953, 17 jin per mu more than mutual aid teams in 1954, and over 27 jin per mu more than individual farmers, exceeding the county's average cotton yield by 17 jin and 14 liang per mu. At the same time, these 162 cooperatives planted a total of 8,740 mu of irrigated and dry land corn, producing 3,321,200 jin of corn, with an average yield of 380 jin per mu. This was an increase of 80 jin per mu compared to 1953, 70 jin more than mutual aid teams in 1954, and 95 jin more than individual farmers. These cooperatives have a total of 3,426 member households. From the trial calculation of preliminary distribution, 2,923 households had increased income compared to 1953, and 229 households had income equal to 1953, accounting for 92% of the total number of member households; 274 households had slightly reduced income compared to 1953, accounting for only 8%. Among the 162 cooperatives, 156 increased production, accounting for 96%; six cooperatives had slightly lower production than in 1953, but their production was still higher than that of mutual aid teams and individual farmers, accounting for only 4%.

However, we must not be deceived by these totals and averages. We cannot fail to notice that there are still many problems in these old cooperatives: the production of six cooperatives decreased compared to 1953; the increase in production of 64 cooperatives was not significant enough. Only 48 cooperatives were in the first category, with good production, good management, and good distribution; more than ten cooperatives were in the third category, with poor production, internal conflicts among the core members, and chaotic labor and financial management. Some cooperatives established in 1952 were not as good as those established in 1953, and those established in 1953 were not as good as those established in 1954. Among the 23 high-yield cooperatives, 11 were new cooperatives established in 1954, 11 were established in 1953, and only one was established in 1952. All six cooperatives that experienced reduced production were established in 1952 and 1953; among them, one cooperative established in 1952 had a significantly lower income in 1954 than in 1953. Why did these undesirable phenomena occur? What are the obstacles to the improvement of old cooperatives? At this meeting, everyone used the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to find out the reasons.

Everyone discovered that most old cooperatives had, to varying degrees, emotions of blind optimism, arrogance, complacency, and lack of ambition. Under the control of this mood, some cooperative cadres treated comrades who went to their cooperatives to help with work with discrimination; they were indifferent to the advanced experiences of other places. They liked flattery and hated criticism. They were complacent with a little achievement, and once praised, they "sat on a plane that wouldn't land." They concealed their own shortcomings in many ways, and were jealous and ridiculed others' achievements. The cooperative led by county labor model Liu Hongyu suffered from cotton aphids in their cotton fields last year; a comrade sent by the prefectural committee to help them urged them to eliminate the aphids, but Liu Hongyu not only did not listen, but also said: "Our cooperative's production increases every year, so there will be no reduction in production!" As a result, last year's cotton yield decreased by 59% compared to the previous year. One cooperative even forgot to plow and sow six mu of land, and the cooperative cadres did not know how tall the grass had grown; when the masses outside the cooperative told them, they smugly said: "Humph, can the land in our cooperative be forgotten and not cultivated!"

A small number of cooperatives, especially those in the third category, had serious disunity among the cooperative cadres. They exposed each other's faults, undermined each other, elevated themselves, and attacked others; you said he had no ability, he said you had no skills. They did not lead production well, and some were even used by class enemies. The head and deputy head of one cooperative have been in serious discord ever since the reclassification of a landlord and a rich peasant household during the general election. What was the result of the discord? A reduction of ninety-six dan of corn. The heads of two cooperatives in one village, who had shared life and death in the struggle to fight the Japanese and eliminate the Jiang-Yan bandits in the past, and were known as "sweet as honey," could not share the joys of creating a happy life after the cooperatives were established and they both became heads; for a little thing, they glared at each other, were jealous and squeezed each other out; they fought for the threshing ground during the wheat harvest, fought for the courtyard during the autumn harvest, and went to the district committee and the county committee to file lawsuits. The masses reflected: "I never expected these two people to end up like this today!"

Under the control of these thoughts and emotions, how can one "treat the cooperative as home," "put the cooperative first, the family second," "run the cooperative together," and "actively labor"? If the cooperative cadres are like this, the members will not cherish public property, but consider their own little rotten rope and broken horse gourd to be sacred and inviolable; they add soil and water to the manure sold to the cooperative, trying to gain an advantage and deceive the cooperative. In the relationship between the individual and the state, some cooperative cadres exaggerate the facts and falsely report high yields when they hear about labor model conferences; they lower production and collectively conceal it when they hear about unified purchase and sale. Some cooperative cadres do not help mutual aid teams, but bully them; they do not treat individual farmers with full enthusiasm, but "give them a hard time"; they do not draw a clear line with landlords and rich peasants, but pity and sympathize with them, unwilling to cleanse those who join the cooperative, and still want to bring in those outside the cooperative; they do not give appropriate care to poor peasant members and new members according to the policy of mutual benefit, but demand absolute equality, the same investment, and the same shareholding.

Through group inspection and general discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that pride and complacency, and disunity, are the main reasons why many old cooperatives cannot improve. If these two stumbling blocks are not removed, the old cooperatives cannot move forward. What is the way to solve this problem? It is to use the power of the collective, carry out criticism and self-criticism, vigorously strengthen the political and ideological education work of agricultural cooperatives, and continuously use socialist, collectivist, patriotic, and united production ideas to fight against capitalist, individualistic, proud, complacent, and divisive thoughts and behaviors.

    什么东西妨碍着老社的提高
    中共洪赵县委农村工作部
    一九五四年十月二十二日到二十六日，中共山西省洪赵县委员会召开了有一百六十二个老社干部参加的干部会议。在这次会议上，运用了大家都当先生、都当学生的群众路线的方法总结了一百六十二个老社在农业生产战线上所取得的成就和经验。从总的成绩来看，这些老社是“增产了，稳固了，办好了，扩大了”。一九五四年，这一百六十二个社，共播种水旱棉田一万八千八百亩，产皮棉一百三十五万三千六百斤，每亩平均产皮棉七十二斤，比一九五三年农业社每亩增产七斤，比一九五四年互助组每亩增产十七斤，比单干农民每亩超过二十七斤，比全县棉田平均亩产超过十七斤十四两。同时，这一百六十二个社，共播种水旱玉米八千七百四十亩，共产玉米三百三十二万一千二百斤，每亩平均产玉米三百八十斤，比一九五三年每亩增产八十斤，比一九五四年互助组超过七十斤，比单干农民超过九十五斤。这些社共有三千四百二十六户社员，从试算预分来看：比一九五三年收入增加了的有两千九百二十三户，收入和一九五三年相等的有二百二十九户，共占社员总户数的百分之九十二；有二百七十四户比一九五三年收入略有减少，只占百分之八。一百六十二个社中，增产的有一百五十六个，占百分之九十六；比一九五三年生产略有减低，但比互助组和单干农民的生产仍高者有六个社，只占百分之四。
    可是，我们决不能为这些总数和平均数所迷惑。不能不注意到，在这些老社中，还存在着好多问题：有六个社的生产量比一九五三年降低了；有六十四个社增产成绩不够显著。生产好、管理好、分配好的一类社只有四十八个；生产搞得不好、社内骨干闹不团结、劳动管理和财务管理混乱的三类社有十多个。有些一九五二年建立的社不如一九五三年建立的，一九五三年建立的社不胜一九五四年建立的。在二十三个丰产社当中，一九五四年办的新社就有十一个，一九五三年办的有十一个，一九五二年办的社只有一个。六个减产的社，都是一九五二年、一九五三年办的社；其中有一九五二年办的一个社，一九五四年的收入大大低于一九五三年。为什么会发生这些不应有的现象呢？老社不能提高的障碍在哪儿呢？在这次会议上，大家运用批评和自我批评的武器，把原因找出来了。
    大家发觉，大部分老社都或多或少地有盲目乐观、骄傲自大、满足现状、不求进取的情绪。在这种情绪的支配下，有些社干部对待去他们社里帮助工作的同志是“看人下菜碟”；对其它地方的先进经验是满不在乎。他们喜人奉承，厌恶批评，有一点成绩就沾沾自喜，一受到表扬就“坐上了不落地的飞机”。对于自己的缺点，多方隐瞒；对别人的成绩，嫉妒嘲讪。县劳动模范刘洪玉领导的社，去年棉田里生了棉蚜；地委派去帮助他们的一位同志动员他们除治，刘洪玉不但不听，还说：“我们这个社生产年年提高，就不会减产！”结果，去年棉花产量比前年减低了百分之五十九。有一个社竟把六亩地忘掉了耕耙下种，草长了多高社干部还不知道；社外群众对面告诉他们，他们还自满地说：“哼，我们社里的地还能丢掉不耕种吗！”
    一小部分社，特别是三类社，社干部有严重的不团结现象。他们互相扬丑，彼此拆台，抬高自己，打击别人；你说他没能力，他说你没本事。他们不好好地领导生产，有的甚至被阶级敌人利用。有一个社正社长和副社长因为改变一户地主和一户富农的成份，从普选到现在一直大闹不团结。闹的结果是什么呢？玉米减产九十六石。有一个村子的两个社的社长，过去在打日本、消灭蒋阎匪特的斗争中，同生死，共患难，人称“蜜里调油”。自从办起社，都当了社长以后，到了创造幸福生活的年代，却不能共甘苦；为一点点小事情，竟然白眼相视，嫉妒排挤；麦收时争场，秋收时争院，找区委，寻县委，大打官司。群众反映：“可没料到这两个人今天能闹成这个样子！”
    在这些思想情绪支配下，怎能“以社为家”
  “先社后家”“大家办社”“积极劳动”呢？社干部是如此，社员们也就对公共财产不加爱护，对自己的一点烂绳索、破马瓢却认为神圣不可侵犯；卖给社里的粪里添土掺水，讨便宜，欺骗社。在个人和国家的关系上，有些社干部听说开劳动模范会，就夸大事实，虚报丰产；听说统购统销就压低产量，集体隐瞒。有些社干部对待互助组不是帮助，而是欺负；对待单干农民，不是满腔热情，而是“给小鞋穿”；对待地主、富农，不是划清界限，而是可怜同情，对入社的不愿清洗，对社外的还想拉进；对待贫农社员和新社员不是按互利政策适当照顾，而是要求绝对平均、同样投资、同样入股。
    通过小组检查，大会讨论，大家一致认为：骄傲自满，闹不团结，就是许多老社不能提高的主要原因。不把这两块绊脚石搬掉，老社就不能前进。解决这个问题的方法是什么呢？就是运用集体的力量，开展批评和自我批评，大力加强农业社的政治思想教育工作，不断地以社会主义、集体主义、爱国主义、团结生产的思想，对资本主义、个人主义、骄傲自满、闹不团结等思想行为进行斗争。
