Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 5th: According to TASS, various sectors of the Soviet national economy adopted more than 900,000 inventions, technological innovations, and rationalization proposals last year, solving important technical problems in many enterprises. Inventors and rationalization proposers at the "Hammer and Sickle" factory in Saratov proposed many innovative suggestions last year, enabling the factory to double its production without expanding its production site. As a result, the factory completed its Fifth Five-Year Plan production tasks four months ahead of schedule, saving a lot of funds.

The fitter Bushe of Riga's "VEF Electrical Factory" designed a machine that can fully automate the metal parts die-forging process. This automatic machine can complete the work that previously required two workers to complete in a month in just one day. Due to the active participation of employees in reforming machines and improving operations, this factory completed its annual production plan ahead of schedule last year, increasing labor productivity by 58 percent.

    苏联各企业去年采用近百万件合理化建议
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联国民经济各部门去年共采用了九十多万件发明、技术革新和合理化建议，解决了许多企业中的重要技术问题。萨拉托夫市“镰刀与锤子”工厂的发明家和合理化建议者，去年提出了很多革新的建议，使这个工厂没有扩充生产场地，就把生产增加了一倍。结果，这个工厂在四个月以前就提前完成了第五个五年计划的生产任务，节约了很多资金。
    里加的“维夫电工厂”的钳工布歇设计了一台可以使金属部件模锻工序全部自动化的机器。这台自动机一天能够完成以前要两个工人一个月才能完成的工作。由于职工积极地参加了改革机器和改进操作的工作，这个工厂在去年提前完成了年度生产计划，把劳动生产率提高了百分之五十八。
