Farmers in Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, and other provinces have begun intensive spring plowing and production activities.

　　In order to fully utilize the land and increase the production of coarse grains, farmers in Guangdong Province are actively rushing to plant 2.15 million mu of early-maturing spring crops such as millet, corn, soybeans, and pumpkins. To help farmers solve the seed shortage for rush planting, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture and the Grain Bureau have purchased more than 2.8 million jin of various seeds from Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other provinces to supply farmers in various regions for planting. These seeds have been successively transported to Guangzhou, and the first batch of 80,000 jin has been transferred to various places. It is estimated that all these early-maturing crops can be planted before and after the 20th of this month and harvested eighty days later.

　　Farmers of all ethnic groups in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region of Guangxi Province have generally started sowing early corn. One hundred and fifty agricultural production cooperatives in Yishan and Xincheng counties and Yongning county have sown more than 4,500 mu of early corn. When sowing corn, most areas have improved their farming techniques. Yao farmers living in the high mountains of the first district of Fengshan County are planting early corn for the first time this year and have applied base fertilizer and practiced deep plowing and fine cultivation. Corn is one of the main grain crops of farmers of all ethnic groups in the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, and the region plans to sow 6.8 million mu of corn this year, requiring an 8% increase in production compared to last year.

　　Farmers in Guizhou Province who grow flue-cured tobacco are carrying out sowing work intensively in accordance with the national plan. Most tobacco areas in Huangping, Lushan, and Shibing counties in the Zhenyuan Special District have completed sowing, and all tobacco areas in Yuqing County have completed sowing. Most tobacco areas in the Bijie Special District are experiencing a surge in sowing. All tobacco-producing areas in the Duyun Special District have also started sowing comprehensively. The planting area of ​​flue-cured tobacco in the Zunyi Special District this year has doubled compared to last year. At present, Fenggang County has basically completed the sowing task, and other counties are sowing or preparing to sow.

　　The ice and snow in the valleys of the Himalayas have melted, and Tibetan farmers are diverting water to irrigate their fields and begin spring plowing. The peaches and willows in Yadong are about to bloom and sprout, and qing稞 and wheat have begun to be sown in individual areas. Most farmers are plowing and fertilizing, and some villages are applying twice as much fertilizer to the fields this spring as last year.

　　Farmers in various parts of Henan Province have started spring plowing earlier this year. Half of the spring land in the entire Xuchang Special District has been plowed. Among them, more than 85% of the land in Lushan County has been plowed. More than 310,000 mu of the 360,000 mu of spring land in Xuchang County has been plowed. Wuyang, Changge, Fugou, and other counties have plowed 70% to 80%, and Shangqiu, Yongcheng, Yucheng, and other counties in the Shangqiu Special District have also plowed about 60% of their spring land. Many agricultural production cooperatives have finished plowing their spring land. Thirteen agricultural production cooperatives in Baofeng County also shallowly plowed the spring land they had plowed last winter.

    南方各省农民开始春耕活动
    【本报讯】广东、广西、贵州等省农民已经开始了紧张的春耕生产活动。
    广东省农民为了充分利用地力，增加杂粮生产，正积极抢种谷子、玉米、黄豆、南瓜等春季早熟作物二百一十五万亩。为了帮助农民解决抢种的种籽困难，广东省农业厅和粮食厅已从广西、湖南、江西等省调购进各种种籽二百八十万多斤，以供应各地农民播种。这些种籽已陆续运来广州，第一批运进的八万斤并已转运各地。这些早熟作物估计在本月二十日前后可以全部种下，八十天后就有收获。
    广西省桂西僮族自治区各族农民普遍开始播种早玉米。宜山、忻城两县和邕宁县的一百五十个农业生产合作社，已播种早玉米四千五百多亩。各地在播种玉米时，大都改进了耕作技术。凤山县第一区住在高山上的瑶族农民，今年第一次播种早玉米，并做到了施基肥，深耕细作。玉米是桂西僮族自治区各族农民的主要粮产之一，全区今年计划播种玉米六百八十万亩。要求比去年增产百分之八。
    贵州省种植烤烟的农民正按照国家计划，紧张进行播种工作。镇远专区黄平、炉山、施秉等县大部烟区已结束播种工作，余庆县全部烟区已结束播种。毕节专区多数烟区正掀起播种热潮。都匀专区各产烟区也全面开始播种。遵义专区今年的烤烟种植面积比去年扩大一倍。目前凤冈县已基本完成播种任务，其他各县正在播种或准备播种。
    喜马拉雅山山谷里的冰雪已经融解，藏族农民正引水灌田，开始春耕。亚东地方的桃、柳快要开花吐芽，个别地区的青稞、小麦已开始下种。大部农民正犁地施肥，有些村子的农民今春下到地里的肥料比去年多了一倍。
    河南省各地农民今年都提前开始春耕，许昌专区全区的春地已经耕了一半。其中鲁山县已耕了百分之八十五以上。许昌县三十六万多亩春地已耕了三十一万多亩。舞阳、长葛、扶沟等县都耕了百分之七十到八十，商邱专区的商邱、永城、虞城等县的春地也都耕了百分之六十左右。许多农业生产合作社的春地已经耕完。宝丰县有十三个农业生产合作社还把在去年冬天耕过的春地又浅耕了一遍。
