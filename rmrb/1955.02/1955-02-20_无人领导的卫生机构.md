To the Editor:

    The Northeast Lumber Industry Bureau's factories have 21 health clinics, with over 230 health workers and an annual medical expense of nearly 10 billion yuan. In addition, almost 1 billion yuan is spent on welfare. However, very few people care about how the health work is actually carried out with all this money spent.

    Currently, the leadership relationships of the factories' health clinics are extremely inconsistent. Some are directly led by the factory director, some by the administrative section (division), some by the safety technology and labor protection section (division), and some are simply not managed by anyone.

    Due to the long-term abandonment of leadership over health work, many problems have arisen in the work of the factories' health clinics. In 1954, there were five major medical accidents caused by dereliction of duty by medical personnel. For example, Doctor Gao Youwei of the Shenglang Factory caused a patient's death due to dereliction of duty. Doctor Sun Chengzhi of the Jilin Factory repeatedly misdiagnosed illnesses, causing much suffering to the workers. The management of the health clinics is chaotic, and there are also many cases of embezzlement and theft of public medicine. For example, Doctor Gao Youzhi of the 43rd Factory stole 2 million yuan worth of public medicine and fled. Doctor Feng Xianyun of the Sanchaizi Factory embezzled 2 million yuan in medical expenses. There are many other problems, too numerous to list.

    There is also a great deal of waste in the medical expenses of the factories' health clinics. For example, the Haolanghe Factory health clinic purchased a high-pressure sterilizer without anyone's approval. Because there is no place to install it, it is stockpiled and cannot be used. The Nancha Factory health clinic arbitrarily purchased electrotherapy equipment, but it can only be left idle because no one knows how to use it. As for the stockpiling and misuse of expensive medicines, it is even more widespread.

    The factories also do not pay enough attention to industrial hygiene. For example, the Tie Li Factory site is very dirty. In the summer, workers who contract gastrointestinal infections and cannot work account for more than 10% of the total number of employees. In the Jiamusi Factory's Second Workshop, the highest number of workers who contracted gastrointestinal infections and could not work in a single day during the summer accounted for more than 17% of all employees.

    The Northeast Lumber Industry Bureau's Safety and Hygiene Section has only one cadre responsible for health work, and in practice, can only serve to copy and forward documents. Last November, the Ministry of Forestry issued instructions on establishing and improving health administrative institutions in the forestry sector, but this has not attracted the attention of the Lumber Bureau's leadership, who instead believe "why bother to do something unnecessary."

    For the sake of the health of the 20,000 lumber workers, I suggest that the Northeast Lumber Industry Bureau quickly improve this situation.

### 无人领导的卫生机构

    无人领导的卫生机构编辑同志：
    东北制材工业管理局所属各厂有二十一个卫生所，共有二百三十多名卫生干部，每年医药费开支将近一百亿元，此外还要花十几亿元的福利事业费。花了这些钱，卫生工作究竟搞得怎样，却很少有人过问。
    目前各厂卫生所的领导关系极不统一，有的直属厂长领导，有的由行政科（股）领导，有的由安全技术劳动保护科（股）领导，还有一些则根本谁也不管。
    由于对卫生工作长期放弃领导，因而各厂卫生所工作中就发生了很多问题。一九五四年因医务人员工作失职而造成的重大医疗事故共五起，如圣浪厂高有维大夫因工作失职造成病人死亡事故，吉林厂孙承志大夫曾多次误诊病症，给工人造成许多痛苦。卫生所管理混乱，贪污和盗窃公家药品的事情也不少。如四三厂高有志大夫盗取公家价值二百万元的药品后逃跑了。三岔子厂冯宪云大夫贪污药费二百万元。其它问题还很多，不能一一列举。
    各厂卫生所医药费开支中浪费也很大。如浩浪河厂卫生所不经任何人批准就购买一台高压消毒器，因为没有房子安装，积压着不能利用。南岔厂卫生所擅自购买电疗仪器，因没有人会使用而只能放着。至于积压和乱用贵重药品更是普遍现象。
    各厂对工业卫生也不够注意。如铁骊厂现场很脏，夏季职工得胃肠传染病而不能出勤的占职工总数百分之十以上，佳木斯厂二车间在夏季职工患胃肠传染病不能出勤的最高的一天占全体职工的百分之十七以上。
    东北制材工业管理局安全卫生科只有一名干部负责卫生工作，实际上只能起上下抄转文件的作用。去年十一月间林业部曾发出了关于建立、健全林业部门卫生行政机构的指示，仍没有引起制材局领导方面的重视，反而认为“何必多此一举”。
    为了两万制材职工的健康，建议东北制材工业管理局迅速改善这种情况。   佟福城
