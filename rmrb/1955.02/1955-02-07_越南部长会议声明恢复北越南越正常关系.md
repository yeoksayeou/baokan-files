    越南部长会议声明恢复北越南越正常关系
    【新华社六日讯】　越南通讯社河内六日讯：越南民主共和国内务部副部长范文白五日在记者招待会上宣布了越南民主共和国政府二月四日关于恢复临时军事分界线两边的北越和南越之间的正常关系的声明。这个声明是由越南民主共和国部长会议在二月初举行的会议上通过的。声明说：“部长会议认为：一、越南是一个从北到南统一的国家。越南人民的政治、经济、文化、社会和感情关系跟他们的团结是不可分的。在八、九年爱国战争期间，越南人民从北到南都曾英勇地作战，以求恢复和平和一起建设祖国。因此，在实现停战之后举行使全国统一的普选之前，恢复南北地区之间的正常关系是完全符合于两个地区的各个阶层人民的真诚愿望的，而且是恢复全国各地的越南人民的正常和富裕生活所必不可少的；
    二、恢复两个地区之间的正常关系是完全符合于日内瓦停战协定的精神的。”
    声明接着说：“由于上述的理由，越南民主共和国政府宣布：
    一、越南民主共和国政府为了满足越南人民真诚的希望，并遵照日内瓦停战协定的精神，准备给予临时军事分界线两边的北部地区和南部地区的人民以一切便利，使他们可以从一个地区寄信到另一个地区，自一个地区迁徙到另一个地区，从一个地区到另一个地区做生意或开办企业，以及交流文化、艺术、科学、技术、运动和其他活动。越南民主共和国政府完全鼓励并协助两个地区的居民从事有利于恢复人民正常生活的一切经济、文化和社会交流活动；
    二、越南民主共和国政府希望南越当局将同意恢复北部地区和南部地区的正常关系，以获得有利于全体人民的解决办法。”
    【新华社河内六日电】　越南民主共和国内务部副部长范文白在五日举行的记者招待会上，对越南民主共和国政府关于恢复临时军事分界线两边的北越和南越之间的正常关系的声明，作了说明。
    范文白说，根据人民日常生活的利益和民族感情的需要，应该使南北之间的关系恢复正常。十七度线只是暂时的军事性质的界线。南北间的经济、文化和社会活动的交流，是完全符合于日内瓦协定的精神的。不仅双方的行政管理权不受侵犯，而且将有助于南北双方当局的相互了解，为解决政治问题造成必要的基础。
    范文白说，越南民主共和国政府各部门目前正在进行研究，必要时，各部门将公布有关南北间经济、文化、社会活动等方面交流的条例。
