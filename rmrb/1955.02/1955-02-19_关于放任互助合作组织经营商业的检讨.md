    Review of Allowing Mutual Aid and Cooperative Organizations to Engage in Commerce
    The Chinese Communist Party, Qingyuan County Committee
    The article "Why Do Mutual Aid and Cooperative Organizations in Qingyuan County Engage in Commerce," published on page two of the People's Daily on January 25th, sternly exposed and criticized the capitalist tendencies within mutual aid and cooperative organizations in our county, as well as the County Committee's erroneous attitude towards this issue. We feel that this error is serious and immediately conducted a review. Preliminary checks have confirmed that the materials exposed are truthful and correct. We express our sincere acceptance and believe that this criticism is of great help in improving our leadership, raising the policy level of our cadres, and promoting the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement. We must deeply remember this lesson.
    Why did this error occur? The main reasons are:
    First, the County Committee did not study the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's "Resolution on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives" deeply or thoroughly enough. We did not fully recognize that agricultural production cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and credit cooperatives are three forms of rural cooperation. These three cooperative economies are interconnected, and their purpose is to gradually link rural economic activities with the country's economic construction plan, gradually transform the small-peasant economy on the basis of production cooperation, and help farmers get rid of commercial exploitation, grain hoarding, and usury, so that the broad masses of farmers can live a prosperous life. The County Committee did not fully recognize that the vast majority of cooperative members were individual farmers in the past. Although they have received some socialist ideological education and joined agricultural production cooperatives, their private ownership concepts are still very strong, and some people still want to take the old capitalist road. All these thoughts will not disappear overnight and must go through a long period of education and ideological struggle. Therefore, the County Committee neglected to conduct regular political and ideological education and business policy education for agricultural production cooperatives, which led to the growth of individualism among many members, and the phenomenon of engaging in commerce increased day by day. Some agricultural cooperative members did not unite and influence the masses outside the cooperative through exemplary compliance with policies and laws, but instead believed that joining the cooperative made them "special," arrogant, discriminated against individual farmers, and competed and confronted with supply and marketing cooperatives. If this situation continues to develop, it will inevitably lead to the collapse or deterioration of agricultural cooperatives, the free spread of capitalism in rural areas, and the destruction of the worker-peasant alliance.
    Second, the County Committee had a one-sided view of disaster relief in leading production and disaster relief, believing that last year's disaster was severe and there were few avenues for sideline production. If commercial activities were not allowed, the income of disaster victims would be even less. Therefore, instead of actively organizing members to seek production avenues from various aspects, we passively allowed commercial activities within the cooperatives, which fueled the capitalist thinking of some members who wanted to "get rich quick." Facts have proven that if capitalist tendencies within the cooperatives cannot be nipped in the bud, they will become more and more serious and have irreconcilable contradictions with the socialist economy. Taking coal sales as an example, initially, some cooperatives mostly used small carts to push and sell coal after processing. Later, in the name of "self-use," they used large trucks and rubber-tired vehicles to fraudulently purchase large quantities, selling them directly without processing, competing with supply and marketing cooperatives, disrupting market prices, and seriously affecting the supply plans of supply and marketing cooperatives. All these situations show that we only cared about the immediate interests of the members and neglected the long-term interests of the members, only cared about the private interests of the members and neglected the interests of the entire people.
    In order to correct this serious error, we have taken the following emergency measures:
    1. We will systematically organize county and district cadres working in rural areas throughout the county to further study the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party's "Resolution on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives" to improve the policy and ideological level of the broad masses of cadres. On the basis of raising ideological awareness, we will use the spirit of criticism and self-criticism (first of all, the County Committee) to examine the capitalist tendencies in mutual aid and cooperative organizations and their root causes, draw a clear line between socialist and capitalist ideology, draw a clear line between legitimate sideline occupations and commerce, and improve the ability to lead agricultural cooperatives.
    2. We will convene a county-wide conference of agricultural cooperative representatives, and also invite deputy secretaries of district committees, secretaries of township general branches, or township heads to participate, totaling more than 1,100 people. In addition to implementing the production and disaster relief policy and the agricultural production plan, the conference will further explain the Party's general line during the transition period, conduct collectivist ideological education, criticize capitalist business thinking, use typical examples to launch discussions, draw a clear line between capitalist and socialist ideology, so that everyone can recognize the nature of agricultural production cooperatives and the purpose of running cooperatives, and consciously eliminate commercial activities.
    3. In conjunction with production and disaster relief and spring plowing production work, we will classify each cooperative by township; for cooperatives engaged in commerce, we will combine the revision of production plans, distinguish between the importance and urgency, and systematically help them to do a good job in changing their line of business, and set a time limit for the recovery of wrongly issued business licenses. While resolutely stopping the phenomenon of mutual aid and cooperative organizations engaging in commerce, we must also prevent serious phenomena such as production stagnation and reduced income due to the change of business, which cause difficulties in the lives of disaster victims.
    4. We will establish a system of regularly conducting political education for members of agricultural production cooperatives, and in conjunction with the current rectification of cooperatives, we will conduct a general education on cooperative charters for members, examine and criticize capitalist business thinking within the cooperatives, and raise the political awareness of members. In the future, we will regularly carry out criticism and self-criticism, give play to the enthusiasm of the broad masses of members, and supervise the operation and management within the cooperatives.

    关于放任互助合作组织经营商业的检讨
    中共清苑县委员会
    一月二十五日人民日报第二版刊载“清苑县的互助合作组织为什么经营商业”一文，严肃地揭发和批判了我县互助合作组织中的资本主义倾向以及县委对这问题的错误态度。我们感到这个错误是严重的，当即进行了检查。据初步检查，证明所揭发的材料是真实的、正确的，我们表示诚恳接受，并认为这一批评对于改进我们的领导工作、提高干部的政策水平，以及促进互助合作运动的开展，都有很大帮助。我们一定要深刻地记取这个教训。
    为什么会发生这种错误呢？主要原因是：
    第一、县委对中共中央“关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”学习得不深不透，没有充分认识到：农业生产合作社、供销合作社和信用合作社是农村合作化的三种形式，这三种合作经济互相联系起来，其目的是逐步地把农村的经济活动和国家的经济建设计划联结起来，逐步地在生产合作的基础上，改造小农经济，帮助农民摆脱商业剥削、粮食囤积和高利盘剥，使广大农民都过上富裕生活。县委没有充分认识到：广大社员过去都是个体农民，他们虽然接受了一些社会主义思想教育，参加了农业生产合作社，可是由于他们的私有观念还很强，有些人还想走资本主义的老路子；所有这些思想都不会在一个早晨消失，还必须经过长时期的教育和思想斗争。因此，县委就忽视了对农业生产合作社经常地进行政治思想教育和经营方针的教育，致使不少社员的个人主义思想增长，经营商业的现象日渐增多；有的农业社社员不是以模范地遵守政策法律的行为，来团结和影响社外群众，而是认为入了社“特殊”，盛气凌人，歧视单干农民，同供销社竞争、对抗。这种情况如果继续发展下去，必然会使农业社垮台或者变质，使资本主义在农村自由泛滥，和破坏工农联盟。
    第二、县委在领导生产救灾中，有片面的救灾观点，认为去年灾重，副业生产门路少，如果不允许搞商业，灾民的收益就更少了。因此，就不积极地从多方面组织社员寻求生产门路，而是消极地对于社内的商业活动听之任之，这就助长了某些社员“发快财”的资本主义思想。事实证明，社内的资本主义倾向，如果不能防微杜渐，是会得寸进尺的，同社会主义经济有着不可调和的矛盾。就以贩煤为例，开始一些社多是用小车推，经过加工出售；后来，则以“自用”为名，用大车胶轮车大量骗购，不经加工，直接贩卖，同供销合作社竞争，捣乱市价，严重地影响了供销合作社的供应计划。所有这些情况说明，我们只顾社员眼前利益而忽略了社员的长远利益，只顾社员私人利益而忽略了全体人民的利益。
    为了纠正这种严重错误，我们采取如下紧急措施：
    一、有计划地组织全县做农村工作的县区干部进一步学习中共中央“关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”，提高广大干部的政策思想水平；在提高思想觉悟的基础上，以批评和自我批评的精神（首先是县委），检查互助合作组织中的资本主义倾向，及其发生的根源，划清与资本主义的思想界限，划清正当的副业和商业的界限，提高领导农业社的本领。
    二、召开全县农业社代表会议，并吸收区委副书记、乡总支书记或乡长参加，约计一千一百余人。会上除了贯彻生产救灾方针和农业生产计划外，进一步讲解了党在过渡时期的总路线，进行集体主义思想教育，批判资本主义经营思想，通过典型，开展讨论，划清资本主义和社会主义的思想界限，使大家认清农业生产合作社的性质和办社的目的，在自觉的基础上，杜绝商业活动。
    三、结合生产救灾和春耕生产工作，以乡为单位，把各社进行分类排队；对于经营商业的社要结合修订生产计划，分别轻重缓急，有计划地帮助它们做好转业工作，限期收回错发的营业牌照。既要坚决杜绝互助合作组织经营商业的现象，也要防止因转业而使生产停顿、收益减少造成灾民生活困难的严重现象发生。
    四、建立经常对农业生产合作社社员进行政治教育的制度，并且结合当前整顿社的工作普遍地对社员进行一次社章教育，检查和批判社内的资本主义经营思想，提高社员的政治觉悟；今后要经常开展批评和自我批评，发挥广大社员的积极性，监督社内的经营管理。
