    China's Struggle is India's Struggle
    By Saifuddin Kitchlew, President of the All-India Peace Council

    On February 6th, throughout India, we held rallies and demonstrations demanding the withdrawal of American troops from Taiwan. This day was "Withdraw from Taiwan Day." It was held at the call of the All-India Peace Council, with the aim of declaring India's firm belief that the interests of Asian peace require Taiwan to return to the embrace of its motherland. Reports about the gatherings held in various states across India on this day are still coming in. People of various opinions united in these gatherings, and it is clear that the towns and villages holding "Withdraw from Taiwan Day" activities were far more widespread than any previous activity conducted by the Indian peace movement.

    This unprecedented activity is because the Indian people recognize that China's struggle to liberate Taiwan is also India's own struggle. The presence of the American army, navy, and air force in Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait is a threat not only to China but to the whole of Asia. The recent debates in the American Congress, where speaker after speaker openly clamored for the use of atomic weapons against mainland China, have further intensified the danger. There is no doubt that the American army has already been equipped with atomic weapons, and as their desperation grows, they will brandish these weapons even more than they do today.

    The Indian people are clear that atomic war would bring terrible disasters to all mankind, no matter where such a war breaks out. This is why, in our country, people view the intensification of tensions in the Far East with such unease, why the masses hold gatherings to demand a fair and just peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue, and to demand the withdrawal of American troops from Taiwan and its associated areas, where they have no reason to remain.

    In India, we unanimously believe that Taiwan must be returned to China. Our country has repeatedly opposed the absurd farce of the Chiang Kai-shek clique representing China in the United Nations. We firmly demand that the People's Republic of China obtain its rightful legitimate seat in the United Nations.

    We are deeply aware that the American and British governments are reneging on their own solemn international obligations by obstructing the return of Taiwan to the People's Republic of China. International agreements and declarations signed by the American President and the British Prime Minister are being shamelessly violated, while these countries are trying to appear as "peace makers," claiming to be preventing China's "aggression" against poor Chiang Kai-shek.

    The people of Asia will not believe such myths. They understand the dangerous implications of various new conspiracies put forward in the name of so-called neutral countries, such as recognizing "two Chinas," "arbitration," "plebiscites," and so on.

    We, the Indian people, are all too aware of the meaning of these various plans, the purpose of which is merely to create a smokescreen for the continued American occupation of Chinese territory. The imperialists' methods are all too familiar to us; we will not be fooled again. We resolutely advocate the freedom of all of Asia and the expulsion of foreign enslavers from our land.

    The struggle to liberate Taiwan, like our struggle to end the enslavement of Goa, is a struggle for freedom against colonialism throughout the world.

    The Chinese people can be fully confident that India wholeheartedly stands on China's side, and we will not rest until Taiwan is returned to its motherland.

    Our "Withdraw from Taiwan Day" movement is continuing. It is a central part of the All-India Peace Council's movement for peace and Asian unity. It is a central part of our struggle to stop atomic war, our people's signature campaign against atomic madness.

    We firmly believe that our common struggle for world peace, for the freedom and unity of Asia and all mankind, will surely triumph. Taiwan must be liberated.

    中国的斗争就是印度的斗争
    全印和平理事会主席  赛福丁·克其鲁
    二月六日，在我们印度，全国都举行了集会和示威，要求美国军队撤出台湾。这一天就是“撤出台湾日”。它是在全印和平理事会的号召下举行的，目的是在于宣布印度的坚定的信念：亚洲和平的利益要求台湾重归它的祖国的怀抱。关于在这一天全印度各个邦举行集会的情况，还在陆续不断传来。各种不同见解的人民在这些集会中联合起来，而且很显然，举行“撤出台湾日”的城镇和村庄远比过去印度和平运动中进行的任何一次活动都要广泛得多。
    这种空前的活动，是因为印度人民认识到，中国解放台湾的斗争也就是印度自己的斗争。美国陆、海、空军驻在台湾和台湾海峡，不仅是对于中国的威胁，而且是对于整个亚洲的威胁。在最近美国国会的辩论中，一个又一个的演说者公然叫嚷要对中国大陆使用原子武器，这就使得危险更加加剧了。毫无疑问，美国军队已经装备了原子武器，随着他们绝望情绪的增长，他们会比今天更多地挥舞这些武器的。
    印度人民清楚，原子战争将给全人类带来可怕的灾难，不论这种战争在什么地方爆发。这就是为什么在我们国家里，人们以这样不安的心情看待远东紧张局势的加剧，为什么群众举行集会，要求台湾问题的合乎公正和道义的和平解决，要求从台湾及其关联的地区撤走美国军队，他们是没有任何理由留驻在那里的。
    在印度，我们一致认为，台湾必须归还中国。我国曾一再反对蒋介石集团在联合国代表中国的荒谬绝伦的滑稽剧。我们坚决地要求中华人民共和国取得它在联合国应有的合法地位。
    我们深深知道，美国和英国政府阻挠把台湾归还给中华人民共和国是在背弃他们自己承担了的庄严的国际义务。美国总统和英国首相所签署的国际协定和宣言正在被无耻地破坏着，而这些国家正在竭力装成“和平缔造者”的样子，说什么阻止中国对可怜的蒋介石的“侵略”。
    亚洲人民是不会相信这样的神话的。他们懂得各种以所谓中立国的名义提出来的新阴谋，如承认
  “两个中国”，“仲裁”，“公民投票”等等的危险的含意。
    我们印度人民对于这些形形色色的计划的意思，是知道得太清楚了，这些计划的目的无非是要为美国继续侵占中国领土制造烟幕。帝国主义者的手段对我们是太熟悉了，我们现在不会再上当。我们坚决地主张整个亚洲的自由和从我们的土地上赶走外国奴役者。
    解放台湾的斗争，正如我们为了结束对果阿的奴役的斗争一样，乃是整个世界反对殖民主义、争取自由的斗争。
    中国人民完全可以相信，印度全心全意地站在中国这一边，而且不到台湾归还它的祖国，我们决不罢休。
    我们的“撤出台湾日”运动，正在继续下去。这是全印和平理事会争取和平和亚洲团结运动的中心环节。这是我们阻止原子战争斗争、我们人民反对原子疯狂症的签名运动的中心环节。
    我们深信，我们为世界和平、为亚洲及全人类的自由和团结的共同斗争一定胜利。台湾一定要获得解放。
