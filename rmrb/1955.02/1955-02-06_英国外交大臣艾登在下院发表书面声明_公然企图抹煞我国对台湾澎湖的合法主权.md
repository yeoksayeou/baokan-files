Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch from London: British Foreign Secretary Eden issued a written statement in the House of Commons on the 4th regarding the status of Taiwan. This statement shows that Eden has once again disregarded international credibility, abandoned the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, and attempted to obscure the truth and distort historical facts. He said: "In the view of Her Majesty's Government, the legal sovereignty over Taiwan and Penghu is either uncertain or has not yet been decided."

In the written statement, Eden could not avoid mentioning the Cairo Declaration, which was signed by the British government, but he described the solemn international agreement, which has strict international legal binding force, as "a statement of intent." He also could not avoid mentioning the Potsdam Proclamation, which stipulated that the terms of the Cairo Declaration regarding the return of Taiwan to China "shall be carried out," and he also mentioned the fact that the Chinese army had taken over Taiwan in September 1945. However, Eden attempted to distort this historical fact, saying that "in fact, this return has never been realized." Eden absurdly said that the aforementioned takeover did "not involve any change in sovereignty," saying that it "does not make the territory Chinese." Just last August 25, however, a British Foreign Office spokesman clearly stated: "The Cairo Declaration stated that Taiwan should be returned to the Chinese government, and this has been done."

Although the British government recognized the government of the People's Republic of China as the legitimate government representing China as early as January 1950, Eden absurdly stated that "there are two entities claiming to represent China."

Eden also said that "any attempt" by the Chinese people to liberate their territory of Taiwan and other coastal islands "would create a situation that endangers peace and security," repeating the logic of the American aggressor bloc and blatantly helping the American aggressors to intimidate the Chinese people. History has proven and will continue to prove that this kind of intimidation is doomed to complete bankruptcy.

### 英国外交大臣艾登在下院发表书面声明  公然企图抹煞我国对台湾澎湖的合法主权

    英国外交大臣艾登在下院发表书面声明
    公然企图抹煞我国对台湾澎湖的合法主权
    【新华社五日讯】伦敦消息：英国外交大臣艾登在四日向下院发表了一项关于台湾地位的书面声明。这个声明表明，艾登又一次不顾国际信义，背弃开罗宣言和波茨坦公告，并企图双手遮天，歪曲历史事实。他说：“在女王政府看来，台湾和澎湖是法律上的主权还不确定或尚未决定的领土。”
    艾登在书面声明中不能不提到有英国政府签字的开罗宣言，但他竟把具有严格的国际法约束力的庄严的国际协议说成是“一项说明意图的声明”。他也不能不提到波茨坦公告规定开罗宣言关于台湾应交还中国的条款“应予实施”，并且他也提到中国军队已经在一九四五年九月接管了台湾的事实。但是，艾登又企图曲解这一历史事实，说什么“事实上，这种交还从来不曾实现过”。艾登竟荒谬地说上述的接管并“不牵涉到主权的任何改变”，说什么这“并不使这块领土成为是中国的”。而就在去年八月二十五日，英国外交部发言人还曾经明确地说过：“开罗宣言说，台湾应归还给中国政府，这一点已经做到了。”
    虽然英国政府早在一九五○年一月就承认中华人民共和国政府是代表中国的合法政府，但艾登又荒唐地说什么“存在着自称代表中国的两个实体”。
    艾登还说什么中国人民解放自己的领土台湾及其他沿海岛屿的“任何尝试……将会引起危及和平和安全的局势”。重复美国侵略集团的逻辑，明目张胆地帮助美国侵略者向中国人民恫吓。历史已经证明并将继续证明这种恫吓是注定要完全破产的。
