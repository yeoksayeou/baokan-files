Comrades,

Ten years have passed since the end of the Second World War. If we compare the current situation with that before the war, the changes in the international situation today are more pronounced and striking than ever before. Before the Second World War, the Soviet Union was the only socialist country surrounded by capitalist countries. This situation had persisted for more than a quarter of a century.

In the post-war period, we can say that the situation has undergone fundamental changes.

Today's Soviet Union and the capitalist encirclement are not comparable to the pre-war Soviet Union and the capitalist encirclement. If someone thinks they are comparable, it means that they have not noticed, or at least underestimated, the extremely important changes that have taken place in the entire international situation. Moreover, not only quantitative changes have occurred, but also qualitative changes.

Everyone knows that the most important result of the First World War was that Russia, through the revolution, became a Soviet socialist state. During the period between the First and Second World Wars, our country achieved tremendous successes in the growth of the socialist economy and the development of socialist culture. Even before the war, socialism had already triumphed in our country, but it was only after the Second World War that the Soviet Union emerged from its international isolation.

The most important result of the Second World War was the formation, in addition to the world capitalist camp, of a world socialist and democratic camp led by the Soviet Union, or more precisely, by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.

The formation of this new camp was made possible by the defeat of fascism, the weakening of the position of the capitalist world, and the unprecedented advance of the democratic movement. Our country, the Soviet people, and their glorious army played a decisive role in these developments in the international situation, as is documented.

In our era, the Soviet Union is no longer in the international situation that existed before the great war. Today, the Soviet Union is no longer the only socialist country in the world. The isolation of the Soviet Union on the international stage is a thing of the past.

In addition to the capitalist camp, the socialist and democratic camp has been formed, uniting the following twelve countries: the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the People's Republic of China, the Polish People's Republic, the Czechoslovak Republic, the German Democratic Republic, the Hungarian People's Republic, the Romanian People's Republic, the Bulgarian People's Republic, the Albanian People's Republic, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

We know that the countries I have listed are at different levels of development and at different stages of social transformation. Alongside the Soviet Union, which has already established the foundations of a socialist society, there are people's democratic countries that have taken only initial but very important steps towards socialism.

However, for all the countries of the democratic camp, what is decisive is that they have finally freed themselves from the imperialist system of rule by landlords and capitalists. They have chosen a new path for themselves and have begun to implement profound democratic and socialist reforms with success, striving to ensure peace and security for all these new and great constructions.

This was made possible because, in these countries, the workers and peasants, together with all the laboring people and democratic forces, have formed a powerful political alliance under the general leadership of the working class. It is precisely this alliance of workers and peasants, which unites all the laboring people, that has made it possible to abolish the landlord system, transfer the land to the peasants, and transfer factories, plants, railways, and banks to the new, truly democratic organs of state power.

The chains of capitalism were not broken in one place but along a very long front. After our country's victorious socialist revolution in 1917, as a result of the Second World War, capitalism also suffered defeats in several other countries.

The achievements of these new, people's democratic-type countries, achieved through the efforts of the people liberated from capitalist shackles, were based on the victory of the Soviet Army over the fascist aggressors and the unwavering support of the Soviet Union for the political, economic, and social reforms they were undertaking towards socialism. However, at present, despite the importance and special role of the Soviet Union, (the basis of the strength of the Soviet Union is the high level of heavy industry, as well as the continuous development of the entire industry and socialist agriculture), the countries of the socialist camp are increasingly relying on mutual support.

Due to the changes in the international situation, the balance of power between social systems has undergone a positive change in favor of socialism, especially in the past ten years. This is a very natural thing.

Can today's Europe still be compared to pre-war Europe?

Can we ignore the enormous changes that have taken place here as a result of the last world war? Together with the Soviet Union, other countries have decisively turned from the capitalist path to the path of socialist development and rebirth, and not a single one of these countries wants to retreat back to capitalism. To anyone who can reason objectively and without prejudice, is this not clear? If we look at the specific facts and figures, we can see that out of the approximately six hundred million people in all of Europe, about half, that is, just under three hundred million, have firmly joined the socialist and democratic camp.

This means that the Europe we see today is very different from pre-war Europe.

In the new Europe of today, the position of the socialist camp countries is not weaker than that of the capitalist camp countries. What is particularly important is that our socialist camp countries, although they have many difficulties and are not without serious shortcomings in their construction work, are advancing with confidence, steadily consolidating the new democratic institutions, and raising the culture and well-being of their people to a higher level.

A new situation has also emerged in Asia.

The population of Asia is approximately fourteen hundred million, more than half of the world's population. Today, in Asia, also, a little less than half of the total population lives in people's democratic countries, which have broken away from the capitalist camp and have set the construction of socialism as their goal.

Just mentioning the situation in China is enough. Not long ago, China was a semi-colonial country, cruelly constrained by imperialist countries and deprived of the possibility of achieving the unification of its own territory; now, China has united into a great country and has embarked on the path of comprehensive development of its own culture and economy. It is worth noting that only since the Communist Party took the lead in the country, all this has become possible. In the most popular songs of the Chinese people, there is a song that says:

"He showed the people the path to liberation,
'Without the Communist Party, there would be no China.' This is not accidental.

Isn't this fact and the profound reforms beginning in Korea and Vietnam proof of the fundamental changes that have taken place in Asia? Isn't all this proof that during the post-war period, revolutionary changes of the greatest historical significance have taken place in Asia?

But the changes in Asia are not limited to the above-mentioned countries.

A fact of great historical significance is that today, colonial India no longer exists, but the Republic of India does. This is an important turning point in the situation that characterizes the development of post-war Asia. As a new and important factor in the cause of strengthening peace and friendship among peoples, the international prestige of India is constantly growing.

Like India, Indonesia and Burma have also freed themselves from the shackles of colonial rule. We hope that the peoples of Pakistan, Ceylon, and other Asian countries will find the path to true national freedom and economic revival.

In April, that is, in two months, the Asian-African Conference will be held in Bandung, Indonesia, with approximately thirty Asian and African countries expected to participate. The very fact of holding such a conference is sufficient to show how great the positive changes that have taken place in Asia in recent times are.

In the Near East and the Middle East, many changes have also taken place.

We cannot say, for example, that in the Arab East, the national liberation movement has become as powerful as in some Asian countries. The countries there, especially those with vast oil resources, are still under the control of the so-called "Western" countries that are involved in local oil and other natural resources. In these places, it often happens that the formation and change of governments depend entirely on the will of American or British oil companies and other foreign capitalists. But there, the national liberation movement is also growing.

Most of the African people are still under the oppression of colonialism. However, it is quite clear that it will soon be impossible to suppress the national liberation movement of the African people as freely as the imperialist countries that have plundered African territory are still doing today.

It can be said that North and South America have not yet taken the historical path that the peoples of Europe and Asia have successfully taken, but the "Iron Curtain" that American imperialism wants to use to separate America from the rest of the world is not as solid as it seems. The plans of monopolistic capital based on the "Iron Hoof" are also in vain. As early as half a century ago, the famous American writer Jack London vividly and sharply described the oppressive rule of monopolistic capital, foreseeing the great difficulties that the peoples of America would face in advancing along the path of true progress and liberation from capitalist shackles.

In any case, if we talk about the period after the Second World War, then so far, the changes that have taken place on the American continent are the least noticeable, but here, the progressive tendencies developing in the depths of the people's lives are increasingly felt. Such a situation does not prove the strength of the American "Iron Curtain," nor does it prove that the "Iron Hoof" with which monopolistic capital is oppressing workers and peasants is particularly reliable; rather, it proves that America will have to overcome its existing backwardness in political development, and it still has to catch up with the political life development of some other countries.

If we compare the entire international situation today with that before the war, we can see how great the changes have been in the past ten to fifteen years. We will not regret these changes.

Therefore, when estimating the entire modern international situation, the mutual relations of the main world forces are of great importance at present. In doing so, we must neither overestimate nor underestimate the situation that has occurred, nor the trend of the development of the situation itself. In any case, we must not forget that this is a great and historically significant period, which has only just passed thirty-seven years and a little more.

Compared to the pre-war period, the position of capitalism and the bourgeoisie has greatly weakened. Can this be denied? No, it cannot be denied. And it is quite clear that the changes that have taken place are in favor of socialism, in favor of democratic and socialist forces.

The Second World War further deepened the general crisis of world capitalism. This is manifested in the fact that a new world camp has appeared, which exists alongside the world capitalist camp. A democratic camp has been established, which, led by the Soviet Union, is advancing along the path of building socialism. These are facts, whether some people like them or not.

The economic consequences of the above-mentioned basic events are the disintegration of the single, all-encompassing world market. Everyone knows that this single world market no longer exists. There are now two parallel, opposing world markets.

As a result, each of the two political camps that have formed since the Second World War has its own corresponding economic base. All this indicates that the general crisis of capitalism has entered a new stage, which began at the time of the Second World War and is the result of the Second World War. This new stage proves that the general crisis of capitalism has deepened greatly.

The facts of the historical changes that have taken place in the international situation seem to be impossible to ignore. However, in reality, this is not always the case.

Capitalism has been forced to retreat under the pressure of the masses, and in many countries, the masses have overthrown the landlords and capitalists, and the power has been seized by their own people—the representatives of the working class and peasants, the democratic forces of cities and villages.

However, the ruling classes of the imperialist countries are not reconciled to this new situation. This applies first and foremost to the United States of America, ruled by millionaires and billionaires. Needless to say, the big capitalists of Britain and other imperialist countries are no different from the big capitalists of the United States.

Their intentions are not difficult to discern.

They hope that the countries that have freed themselves from capitalist shackles will again fall under the rule of capital. The foreign policy currently pursued by the imperialist countries—especially countries like the United States of America and Britain—also proves this.

It is not difficult to understand why the American ruling circles—let us take an example—openly declare that the main goal of their foreign policy is precisely the so-called "liberation" of those countries where the workers and peasants have already won victories and the laboring people themselves are in power. They even talk about such "liberation"—allow me to use this word—precisely as meaning the return of these countries to the capitalist paradise, or, as they usually put it, to the "free world."

They believe that the capitalist system is such a "free world" in which the gentlemen exploiters feel very "free," and the ruling class can "freely" and even arbitrarily exploit the laboring people.

They want to "liberate" the people's democratic countries from the state power established by the revolutionary alliance of workers and peasants and replace it with the power they approve of, that is, to overthrow the new, socialist, democratic order established after the war in these countries, and again force these countries to accept the capitalist system they so love, the system of exploitation of the laboring people, the system of rule by capitalists and landlords.

They want to start with the countries where they think their agents can become active relatively quickly. Everyone knows, for example, that such an attempt was made in Berlin on June 17, 1953. However, the whole world knows that this attempt ended in a shameful failure. This could have been a lesson for the imperialist aggressors, but the propaganda about such an adventurous enterprise continues.

The greed of the imperialist aggressors and their evil reactionary dreams are not limited to the people's democratic countries. They also want to restore capitalism in our country.

They do not always say this openly, but they do say it.

For example, let everyone listen to how far Mr. Churchill, who is rightly considered one of the most famous imperialist thinkers, has gone. To this day, he still talks over and over again about an idea he himself calls a "lifelong" obsession, that is, the idea of "strangling Bolshevism in its cradle."

Here is one of his statements on this issue, which he made on June 28, 1954, at the National Press Club in Washington: "I assure you, I am one of the truly outstanding people in this (communist) struggle. If I had received proper support in 1919, I think we might have already strangled communism in the 'cradle,' but everyone raised their hands in opposition, saying, 'What a horrible idea!'"

Even in 1954, after so many years since the victory of the socialist revolution in our country, Mr. Churchill has not been able to find anything smarter than saying that communism should be strangled in the "cradle," although, it seems, it is already too late for him to do so.

Indeed, he is a man who has missed a good opportunity.

We are not against mocking the madness of such anti-Soviet reasoning now. However, we cannot be naive; communists, like all the Soviet people, cannot expect any goodwill or sympathy from the imperialists.

Churchill's statements are full of nostalgia for the past. He harbors irreconcilable hostility towards everything new that has appeared with the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution and has become a great movement of all peoples for the true liberation of the working class and all laboring people, for liberation from the oppression of the bourgeoisie and landlords.

For the past thirty-eight years, Mr. Churchill has been demanding the overthrow of the socialist system—wherever it appears, loudly shouting that it must be "strangled in the cradle."

He has expressed the desire that has always been in the hearts of these imperialists, who want only one thing: complete domination, that is, domination over the whole world.

But if the people themselves have chosen another path, breaking with capitalism and taking the path of socialism and people's democracy, then how can this goal be achieved?

The answer to this question is the "policy of force," that is, the foreign policy line declared by American and British imperialism. The rulers of these countries have shown the wishes of the most aggressive capitalists, firmly rejecting the facts.

They do not want to recognize the right of the people to determine their own destiny, and therefore also do not want to recognize the right of the people to discard the old, eliminate the capitalist system, and establish their own new socialist system.

The thoughts of the aggressive imperialists are different. They do not want to recognize the legitimate desire of the people to free themselves from capitalist shackles and strive to restore the rule of capitalism over the whole world. It is precisely this reason that determines—let us take an example—the foreign policy line of the United States of America, the purpose of which is to restore the rule of imperialism over the whole world, to overthrow socialism, and to overthrow the power of the laboring people in the people's democratic countries.

It is these goals that have become the driving force behind the aggressive foreign policy of the United States. This policy can only mean the preparation for another world war, a war aimed at restoring the rule of imperialism over the whole world.

All this means that new things are born in the midst of a fierce struggle with the old; socialism cannot triumph in one country or another unless it repels and overcomes the resistance of imperialism and its agent organizations.

The post-war international situation is such. This situation has determined the nature of the main developments in recent years.

II. Two Lines of Foreign Policy

The Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp are resolutely and confidently defending the positions won by the people and are striving to continuously consolidate these positions, seeking a peaceful and peaceful environment for their socialist construction.

The democratic and socialist camp is a peaceful camp. Therefore, it is usually called the peaceful, democratic, and socialist camp.

To defend peace and the interests of socialism, the Soviet Union insists on its policy of easing international tensions.

All the countries of the democratic camp support this policy of easing international tensions together with the Soviet Union.

Opposite the peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet Union is the foreign policy line of the United States, which is manifested in the "policy of force."

The aggressive nature of American foreign policy is extremely obvious.

Therefore, is it surprising that the masses are actively concerned about the development of the international situation?

Millions of men and women closely follow the situation: is it developing in a direction that strengthens peace, or conversely, in a direction that increases the danger of another war? There is nothing that affects the fate of the people more than war, and there is nothing that brings more grief and suffering to the people than war. The Second World War took the lives of tens of millions of people, not to mention the immeasurable material losses suffered by the people. If humanity is thrown into a new war, its consequences will be many times more severe than the consequences of the Second World War, can anyone not see this?

In the events of international life, the Soviet Union occupies a special position.

The Soviet Union—the country of the victory of socialism, in the active struggle for peace and against the warmongers, occupies a glorious position. Today, the Soviet Union has become the main pillar of the consolidation of peace and friendship among peoples.

With the strengthening of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all the people's democratic countries, and with the expansion of the peace movement in all other countries, the peoples of the world increasingly realize that the cause of peace is in their own hands, and as long as they do not relax their efforts and, if necessary, resolutely carry the cause of defending peace to the end, they can prevent a new war and defend peace.

The Soviet Union considers its main task to be: to strengthen the forces of peace and to promote the easing of international tensions.

This line of Soviet foreign policy most fully corresponds to the interests of maintaining and consolidating peace. At the same time, this line helps to expose the plans and intrigues of the warmongers and those imperialist forces that are trying to rely on "force," which in reality is increasingly becoming a policy of preparing for the Third World War. At present, the struggle between the two opposing lines of foreign policy is developing.

The peaceful line of Soviet foreign policy is increasingly supported in the democratic camp and among the democratic strata of all countries; while the aggressive line of American foreign policy relies on the continuous establishment of new aggressive military alliances and military blocs, and recently has manifested itself in the open propaganda and preparation for atomic war.

At the same time, there are also such countries that, from an economic point of view, are basically linked to the capitalist system, but in international issues, they show concern for maintaining peace and easing international tensions. The importance of strengthening such a trend should not be underestimated.

What does the policy of easing international tensions mean?

It is best to judge this based on the facts. Examples can be given from the events of last year and today.

Due to the insistence of the Soviet Union, in late January and the first half of February 1954, the foreign ministers of France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union held a meeting in Berlin.

At this meeting, we sought to adopt resolutions that would greatly ease international relations. We demanded that all four countries resolutely condemn the plans to revive militarism in West Germany and strive for the Berlin Conference to make progress on the issue of convening a universal disarmament conference. However, the representatives of the United States, Britain, and France did not cooperate with us on this.

Nevertheless, the Berlin Conference played an important and positive role.

The significance of the Berlin Conference is primarily that it laid the foundation for the resumption of the international conference of the great powers, which had been interrupted for five years, which is of great importance for solving urgent international problems. As for the resolution adopted at the Berlin Conference on convening another conference (this conference was later held in Geneva), everyone knows that it has produced positive results.

Everyone knows that, in addition to France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the representatives of the People's Republic of China and the countries related to the solution of the Korean and Indochina problems also participated in the Geneva Conference. If the success of the Berlin Conference was to make a decision to convene the Geneva Conference (despite the opposition of the United States, all five great powers, including the People's Republic of China, participated in this conference), then the positive results of the Geneva Conference prove how necessary it was for China to participate in this conference.

The Geneva Conference did not fully complete its task because it did not make progress on the Korean issue. However, at this conference, agreements were reached on the cessation of the eight-year war in Vietnam and on the cessation of military operations in Laos and Cambodia. The ability to reach these agreements was primarily due to the fact that the Vietnamese people fought selflessly for freedom and national independence. This struggle received active sympathy and support from the peoples of other countries. All this was acknowledged to a certain extent at the Geneva Conference.

The United States openly tried to obstruct the conclusion of an agreement on the restoration of peace in Indochina. Whether it was the American Secretary of State Dulles or the American Vice President Nixon, these stubborn advocates of the "policy of force" openly did not want to end the war, opposed satisfying the legitimate demands of the Vietnamese people, and wanted to continue the war, using armed suppression of the national liberation movement in Indochina. They had a plan to "internationalize" the war against the Vietnamese people, in addition to France, to drag the United States and Britain into this war; and they were ready to do everything possible to obstruct the Geneva Conference from reaching an agreement.

Things have reached the point where the American Secretary of State Dulles even refused to participate in the discussion of the Indochina issue and demonstratively left Geneva. However, the result of the United States showing its aggressiveness was that it only got itself into an isolated position, without achieving any other purpose.

The results of the Geneva Conference were seen as a failure of the forces of aggression and a great victory of the forces of peace. Because the Geneva Conference promoted the easing of international tensions and the consolidation of peace.

However, the American aggression group does not want to calm down. As soon as the Geneva Conference ended, the American Secretary of State Dulles convened his own meeting in Manila (Philippines). The obvious purpose of convening this meeting was to obstruct the implementation of the decisions of the Geneva Conference, and some of the participating countries of the Geneva Conference, despite the impact on their prestige, agreed to help this aggressive affair.

At the Manila Conference convened by Dulles, the so-called "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" was signed, which is a military bloc composed of the United States, Britain, and France, these colonial countries, as well as some Asian countries such as the Philippines, Thailand, and Pakistan that depend on them. This treaty is full of plans to strangle the national liberation movement in Asia; its spearhead is clearly aimed at the People's Republic of China; the international prestige of the People's Republic of China has greatly increased during the period of the Geneva Conference, despite the hostile activities of various reactionaries.

All this proves what?

It proves that in the current situation, steps favorable to the easing of international tensions have encountered the thousandfold opposition of the most aggressive groups, who do not want to ease tensions but are eager to exacerbate tensions. This means that to ease the tensions in international relations, there is no other way but to wage a resolute struggle against the most aggressive forces and their intrigues, and therefore, this struggle must not only not be relaxed but must be continued more resolutely, flexibly, and consistently.

The events taking place in the Far East today also prove that the forces of aggression are again trying to make great efforts to obstruct the easing of international tensions.

The events in Taiwan and other island regions of China are not proof of this, but what else?

It is difficult to find in the history of imperialist aggression facts more shameless than those that have taken place in this region in recent years.

Taiwan Island and the Penghu Islands are indisputably Chinese territory, and other islands belonging to China are even more so. The Cairo Declaration signed by the United States and Britain in 1943, as well as the Potsdam Proclamation of 1945, especially acknowledge this. In addition, the Japanese surrender document also confirmed this, and Japan, which occupied these islands at the end of the 19th century, has returned them to China according to the surrender document.

Nevertheless, the United States is still occupying these islands and is using money to maintain the criminal gang of Chiang Kai-shek, who was driven out of China, preparing to use Chiang Kai-shek's mercenary army to attack China. Recently, things have developed to the point where the American President and the American Congress are so infatuated with their "policy of force" that they have begun to openly threaten war against the Chinese people who are defending their rights to these islands and maintaining their national honor and sovereignty from invaders.

The position of the Soviet Union on this issue is clear and everyone knows it.

We believe that the Taiwan issue is an internal affair of China, and the armed robbery and war threats of the United States are aggression. If the United Nations values its prestige, it should unconditionally condemn such aggression. Due to the opposition of the United States, the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations have not yet been restored, and this situation can no longer be tolerated. The United States must withdraw all its armed forces, including the air force and navy, from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. Only then will military operations in the Far East stop and peace be established.

The position of the United States on the Taiwan issue creates a threat to the maintenance of peace and exacerbates international tensions, while the position taken by the Soviet Union on this issue is conducive to the easing of international tensions and aims to consolidate peace in the Far East.

Of course, the easing of international tensions that we are talking about cannot be achieved by destroying or dividing the freedom and national rights of any country or nation, but should be achieved under the condition of guaranteeing and striving to strengthen these democratic rights, which is precisely what the interests of progress in the life of all countries and nations require.

The above-mentioned events in Asia are indeed very important, but it would be wrong to think that the situation in Europe can be pushed to the second place.

Just mentioning the Paris Agreements can illustrate the sharpness of the situation that has formed in Europe.

It is unnecessary to prove that since the end of the Second World War, the German question has become the center of all post-war problems in Europe. In fact, the ten years since the war have been enough to agree on a clear path and method for solving the German question. However, this is not the case.

During the war and immediately after the war, all the countries of the anti-Hitler coalition agreed on their main common task: to ensure that Germany develops into a united, peaceful, and democratic country. However, in the years immediately following the war, it became clear that not all these countries were truly working for this purpose. For some countries, such as the Soviet Union, this task has been and remains the basis of their policy on the German question. For other countries, this is just a piece of paper; they signed these documents but did not intend to seriously fulfill the agreements they signed.

The Soviet Union has been and remains insistent on fulfilling the basic tasks of the international agreements signed in Yalta and Potsdam. We are not talking about some clauses of these agreements, because many of them have long since become outdated and no one needs them. However, if we value the interests of peace and freedom of the peoples of Europe, the basic issues raised in these extremely important international agreements, including the issue of the reunification of Germany into a truly peaceful and democratic country, cannot be removed from the agenda. This issue will continue to exist as long as it is not solved in a way that takes into account the interests of consolidating peace in Europe and the national revival of a united democratic Germany. The steadily growing peaceful forces of the German people regard the German Democratic Republic, which is steadfastly pursuing the cause of the reunification of Germany, as their reliable support.

In this regard, it is also necessary to analyze the issue of the Paris Agreements.

Whether it is the rejected "European Defense Community" plan or the Paris Agreements, their essence can be reduced to one point: both plans are to open the door to the revival of German militarism in West Germany and to draw militarized West Germany into the aggressive military blocs of the Western countries. There is not much difference between the two: originally, it was intended to incorporate the West German army into the so-called "European Army," while the Paris Agreements stipulate the incorporation of the West German army into the "Western European Army." This can be compared to: "Yam does not taste sweeter than radish, coal is not whiter than cinder." All these are directly contrary to the famous international agreements signed by the four great powers to prevent the revival of German militarism, and they also grossly violate the Anglo-Soviet Treaty and the Franco-Soviet Treaty. According to these two treaties, Britain and France are obligated, together with the Soviet Union, to take joint measures to prevent the possibility of German aggression, and not to participate in military blocs against the Soviet Union. The United States, Britain, and France are trampling on and violating the extremely important international agreements and treaties signed with the Soviet Union, and are striving to get the Paris Agreements approved and implemented as soon as possible.

The Paris Agreements encountered great obstacles when they were passed in the parliaments of the European countries.

It is enough to point out that, despite the fact that those who do not believe in the necessity of the Paris Agreements suffered enormous external pressure and many threats from the United States, the deputies who voted in favor of the Paris Agreements in the French Parliament were still in the minority. In the British Parliament, only a minority of deputies voted in favor of the Paris Agreements. Everyone knows that the parliamentary group of the Labor Party decided to abstain from voting. Even in West Germany, all the major trade unions, working-class parties, and mass organizations (to a certain extent, the true sentiments of the majority of the German people can be judged by the attitude of these organizations) are firmly opposed to the Paris Agreements and the remilitarization, because the German people, of course, cannot forget the most tragic consequences that the two world wars brought to Germany.

In such a situation, what value can the Paris Agreements have, which were forced through and condemned and rejected by the peoples of the European countries? However, once the Paris Agreements are approved and implemented, it is impossible not to fully estimate their harmful and directly dangerous consequences.

The danger of approving the Paris Agreements for the peoples of the European countries lies in the fact that these agreements are not for the consolidation of peace, but for the provocation of war. Among those who want to collude with the crazy revenge-seekers and militarists of West Germany, will there be few adventurers?

It is also necessary to consider that the approval of the Paris Agreements will deal a very heavy blow to the national interests of the German people.

Once the Paris Agreements are approved, they will become the main obstacle to solving the German question and will make it impossible for Germany to be reunited for a long time. If West Germany is rearmed and becomes a militaristic country, this part of Germany will not be able to unite with the eastern part of Germany, that is, with the peaceful German Democratic Republic. Some people say that the approval of the Paris Agreements does not hinder fruitful negotiations on the restoration of German unity, and all such statements have only one purpose: to try to get the parliaments of the countries to pass the Paris Agreements and to use all means to deceive and confuse public opinion for this purpose.

On the contrary, if the Paris Agreements are rejected and the appropriate agreements are reached by France, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, then it will be possible this year to hold free elections throughout Germany to restore the unity of Germany on the basis of peace and democracy. The meaning of the statement issued by the Soviet government on January 15 on the German question is precisely this.

Some people want the French, Belgians, Norwegians, and other countries' people to believe that the Paris Agreements, which stipulate the revival of the German defense forces, are necessary to guarantee their security. Some people are shamelessly deceiving them, claiming that the security of the countries of Western Europe is threatened by the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, but even those who keep shouting such words know that this is a vile and despicable slander against our peaceful homeland and all the people's democratic countries. However, the advocates of the policy of aggression have a large number of bourgeois newspapers with a wide circulation and many radio stations that keep shouting from morning to night. They control the entire state apparatus and various agents hired by batches of capitalists, who are selling their honor and conscience every day, spreading hateful anti-Soviet lies and slander, and becoming more and more shameless, because they feel that their foundation is shaking.

III. The Soviet Union's Struggle for Peace and the Guarantee of Collective Security

No slander and no fabricated conjecture can conceal from the peoples of the countries a fact, namely, that the Soviet Union is engaged in an unceasing struggle for peace and the guarantee of collective security in Europe.

The draft treaty proposed by the Soviet Union to guarantee the collective security of all European countries (regardless of their social and state systems) is well known to everyone.

This draft has received the support of many European countries and has received a warm response in all countries, although the ruling circles of some countries try to maintain silence about the Soviet proposals on collective security and constantly distort the spirit of these proposals.

The Soviet government has expressed its willingness to discuss other proposals regarding European collective security. For this purpose, the Soviet government has proposed to convene a pan-European conference to discuss the Soviet plan and other possible proposals regarding the guarantee of peace and European security.

However, none of the opponents of the Soviet proposal has ever proposed any other plan for guaranteeing European collective security. The governments of the member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have refused to participate in the discussion of this issue at the pan-European conference.

At the same time, they say that they are only interested in such treaties in which the participating countries belong to the same "ideological system" as the member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This shows how unprincipled they are in their own participation in the United Nations, because the foundation of the United Nations is the principle of the equal right of all countries to participate in the United Nations, regardless of their social system. Their statements also prove that they do not want to guarantee the peace and true security of Europe at all, and that their military blocs are aimed at hostile purposes against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

They oppose the peaceful policy of the Soviet Union, which aims to guarantee the peace and security of all European countries (regardless of their social system), with the policy of establishing military blocs of some countries against other countries. Therefore, they should be held responsible for the plans of aggression and their actions, which are not for the interests of peace and therefore not for the interests of their own peoples, but for the interests of the aggressive "policy of force" groups and ruling circles, who are rightly called war provocateurs.

Therefore, the position of the Soviet Union on the Paris Agreements is very clear. This position is impregnable.

Title: The Paris Agreements and the Danger of German Militarism

We are fully aware that once the Paris Agreements are approved, West Germany will embark on the path of reviving militarism, and it will effectively fall under the control of German revanchists. It should be said that French patriots, after hearing Édouard Herriot's excellent speech, will also fully understand the consequences of such actions.

Since the Paris Agreements stipulate that a remilitarized West Germany will join France, Britain, Italy, and other countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Western European Union, a new situation will emerge in Europe. Because after this, the danger of a new war will significantly increase.

The Soviet Union and the other people's democracies cannot ignore this fact, because the Paris Agreements are directed against these countries. The Soviet people and the Soviet Army sincerely love peace, but they are also deeply vigilant and determined to defend their socialist achievements. If the aggressors have received their due lessons in the past, then now they should not forget the limitless growth of Soviet power, nor should they forget that in our army, seventy-seven out of every hundred are Communists and Komsomols. Communists and Komsomols are particularly adept at defending communist achievements from aggression.

Given the new situation in Europe, the Soviet Union and the other peace-loving countries that are opposed by the Paris Agreements will not sit idly by. They must take corresponding measures to further consolidate their security and ensure European peace.

The well-known Moscow Conference, which concluded on December 2 last year and issued a unanimous and resolute declaration, has already clearly stated all these things. The declaration was signed by: the Soviet Union, the Polish People's Republic, the Czechoslovak Republic, the German Democratic Republic, the Hungarian People's Republic, the Romanian People's Republic, the Bulgarian People's Republic, and the People's Republic of Albania.

The eight countries that participated in the Moscow Conference unequivocally declared that if the Paris Agreements are approved, they will take all necessary measures to strengthen their international positions, to ensure peace, and to secure European security. This requires us to invest new and enormous human and material resources. However, rest assured, gentlemen of militarism, we are not reluctant to do so.

Among these measures, the first is to prepare for the conclusion of a Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance among the eight countries of the Moscow Conference. To avoid delay, the relevant consultations are currently underway. To respond to the new military alliances and organizations that are being formed with the participation of German militarism, we will further unite our forces, further strengthen our friendship, improve our cooperation in all areas, and, if necessary, further expand mutual assistance.

Among the measures that we will have to take after the establishment of the Western European military alliance with the participation of a remilitarized West Germany, there should also be the measure to establish a unified military command of the aforementioned eight countries. This measure must be taken because it is necessary to strengthen the defensive capabilities of the Soviet Union and other peace-loving European countries to prevent all sudden and unexpected events. Once we establish a unified military command of the European peace-loving countries, then the aggressor bloc may also abandon their adventurous plans and become a bit quieter.

We openly declare this and believe it necessary to inform our people of the current situation. We are confident that the people will correctly understand us.

Everyone knows very well that the recognition of the facts by the peoples of various countries is the most reliable way to serve the interests of peace and to guarantee the security of peace-loving countries. From what has been said above, it can be seen that the foreign policy of the Soviet Union is aimed at maintaining and consolidating peace.

Therefore, we strive to take measures conducive to easing international tensions, advocate negotiations and agreements with other countries that are conducive to easing international tensions. Naturally, whether these goals can be achieved depends entirely on whether the other party also shows the same sincerity.

The nature of our relations with other countries is primarily determined by the extent to which the development of these relations can contribute to the consolidation of peace and the maintenance of peace in accordance with the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

What can be said about the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union?

The relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union still needs to be improved. Is it possible to improve the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union? It is entirely possible. However, to achieve this, not only the Soviet government but also the American government must have the desire to do so.

The relationship with Britain and France began to develop positively not long ago, but then it encountered reefs, or more accurately, it encountered the Paris Agreements and the plans to revive aggressive German militarism. If the Paris Agreements are irrevocably approved and implemented, it means that Britain and France not only do not value the treaties they concluded with the Soviet Union during the Second World War, but they are directly abrogating and nullifying these treaties. This consequence is inevitable because the Paris Agreements, by opening the door to the revival of German militarism and dragging a remilitarized Germany into the anti-Soviet bloc, are incompatible with the Anglo-Soviet and Franco-Soviet treaties.

Let me compare the development of our relations with neighboring countries such as Finland and Norway.

The relationship between the Soviet Union and Finland is developing according to the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance of 1948. Some facts can be cited to prove the development of economic and political relations between the two countries. The visit of the Finnish government delegation led by Mr. K. A. Fagerholm to Moscow last year and the reciprocal visit of the Soviet government delegation led by Comrade N. A. Mikoyan to Finland further improved the Soviet-Finnish relations based on better mutual understanding.

As for the relationship between the Soviet Union and Norway, the Soviet Union must take into account the fact that Norway has become a member of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, and the activities of this treaty are certainly not aimed at consolidating European peace. In any case, Norway should not forget that the maintenance of good-neighborly relations between the Soviet Union and Norway is beneficial not only to our country but also to Norway.

I would also like to talk about the mutual relations with neighboring countries such as Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan.

Who does not know that the Soviet Union has taken a series of steps to improve relations with Turkey? However, the Turkish authorities still insist on a position that is not conducive to normal good-neighborly relations, turning their territory and territorial waters into a kind of venue for military exercises and military demonstrations by foreign armed forces, especially American armed forces. The Soviet government believes that the mutual interests of Turkey and the Soviet Union require the maintenance of good-neighborly relations between the two countries.

The relationship with Iran has shown some improvement. After long negotiations, the Soviet Union and Iran signed an agreement on important border and financial issues. We hope that the constant pressure exerted by foreign aggressive forces to drag Iran into their military and political blocs in the Middle East will not hinder the continued development of Soviet-Iranian relations in this direction.

Our relations with Afghanistan are developing normally, and we believe that this is in the interests of both countries.

We are very pleased to note that friendly relations between the Soviet Union and India have been further strengthened.

The political, economic, and cultural relations between the Soviet Union and India are developing smoothly, which helps to make the peoples of the two countries, who respect and sincerely sympathize with each other, even closer.

Recently, the two countries signed an important economic agreement. According to this agreement, the Soviet Union will be responsible for building a large metallurgical plant in India with favorable long-term loans, which can produce more than a hundred million tons of steel and the corresponding amount of steel products annually. The Soviet Union will supply all the equipment and provide the necessary technical assistance, including sending highly qualified experts. We were very happy to agree to these requests because the development of Indian metallurgy will help to ensure the national independence and economic development of this ancient and great country, which is deeply sympathized with by all the peoples of the Soviet Union.

Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru will visit the Soviet Union this summer. The news of Mr. Nehru's visit to the Soviet Union has received a very friendly response from the Soviet people.

Our relations with the other two Asian countries, Burma and Indonesia, are also continuing to strengthen.

It can be noted that, except for Iraq, relations between the Soviet Union and the Arab countries have recently shown positive factors.

As for Iraq's severance of relations with the Soviet Union, it can be said that this is mainly due to the excessive eagerness of the current Iraqi government to dance to the tune of the "Western" imperialists. The people of the Arab countries must know that the Soviet people have friendly feelings towards these countries, and the Soviet countries have been and will be a reliable pillar for them to defend their sovereignty and national independence.

Everyone knows that the Soviet Union is striving to normalize relations with Japan.

The Soviet Union has recently established direct contact with the Japanese government. We hope that this will produce the corresponding positive results.

The Soviet Union attaches great importance to the solution of the Austrian problem, to the solution of the problem of fully restoring the independence of democratic Austria in accordance with the interests of maintaining and consolidating European peace.

The Soviet government believes that any further delay in concluding the Austrian State Treaty is unreasonable. At the same time, it is impossible not to take into account the dangers that the Paris Agreements, which aim to remilitarize West Germany, will bring to Austria.

Based on the above, the Soviet government has reason to draw the following conclusions regarding the Austrian problem:

(1) First of all, it must be noted that the study of solutions to the Austrian problem cannot be separated from the German problem, especially when there are plans to remilitarize West Germany, which increases the danger of a new German-Austrian Anschluss, even more so.

This means that when concluding the Austrian State Treaty on the restoration of an independent, democratic Austria, it is necessary to seek a solution that can eliminate the possibility of a new German-Austrian Anschluss, and this is related to the corresponding measures that the four powers should take in agreement regarding the German problem. In this case, it is not necessary to wait for the conclusion of the German State Treaty; the withdrawal of the four powers' troops from Austria can be realized.

(2) Austria should undertake the obligation not to join any bloc or military alliance aimed at any country that participated in the anti-Hitler German war with its armed forces and participated in the liberation of Austria, and not to allow the establishment of foreign military bases on its territory.

The governments of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should also undertake the obligation to fulfill the above provisions.

(3) In order to solve the Austrian problem as soon as possible, it is necessary to immediately convene a four-power conference to discuss the German problem and the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty. Of course, Austria should also participate in the solution of the Austrian State Treaty issue.

At the same time, it must be noted that the approval of the Paris Agreements, which open the way to the revival of West German militarism, will create a serious threat of a German-Austrian Anschluss, that is, a threat to Austrian independence.

Everyone knows that there have been achievements in the relationship between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia recently.

We do not think that everything has been done in this regard, but we also think that this also depends on Yugoslavia. It seems that Yugoslavia, in recent years, has to some extent deviated from the position it adopted in the early years after the Second World War. This, of course, is entirely its internal affair. The Soviet Union seeks to develop economic, political, and cultural relations with Yugoslavia. At the same time, we strive to coordinate our efforts as much as possible in the cause of ensuring peace and international security, which is of decisive importance to the peoples of all countries. We are convinced that the positive policy in the development of Soviet-Yugoslav relations is in the interests of both the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.

Now I would like to talk about the development of relations with Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and the German Democratic Republic, these people's democracies, as well as with the German Democratic Republic. Relations with these countries are developing smoothly on the basis of brotherly friendship and comprehensive cooperation to consolidate peace and increase the happiness of the broad masses of the people.

In the East, we also develop such brotherly friendship and extensive cooperation with the People's Republic of China, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the Mongolian People's Republic, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

We have a friendship and brotherly relationship with the great People's Republic of China that is growing stronger every year.

The visit of the Soviet government delegation led by N. S. Khrushchev, N. A. Bulganin, A. I. Mikoyan, and N. M. Shvernik to China last year and the signing of important documents in the fields of economic cooperation and international cooperation clearly demonstrated the new type of socialist relations between our two great countries.

Regardless of whether it is with the above-mentioned countries or with all other countries, the Soviet Union strives to maintain relations that can promote world peace and international security. We are very pleased to note that the European and Asian people's democracies are fully supporting this policy and are resolutely implementing the policy of easing international tensions together with the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union and the people's democracies have established friendly cooperation in all areas, political, economic, cultural, etc., and this cooperation is constantly strengthening. The basis of this cooperation is the unwavering adherence to the principles of respect for national sovereignty and national independence. Of course, when necessary, this cooperation also expands to the strengthening of the defense capabilities of all these countries.

However, the Soviet Union and the countries of the socialist camp have never, and now do not, establish any military blocs against other countries. They will not do so in the future, but if someone wants to implement an aggressive plan and hopes to use this plan to revive German militarism and prepare to attack peace-loving countries, then they will have to unite their forces to ensure their own security.

The countries of the socialist camp have not yet had the need to unite their military forces. The necessary unity between them in all respects has been and is being achieved through the contact, cooperation, and mutual assistance of affairs, and the unbreakable friendship and brotherly relations tightly bind their activities together.

As a result, the nine-hundred-million-strong bloc of peace, democracy, and socialism, which includes the Soviet Union and the twelve people's democracies, has been formed. In these countries, the laboring people hold power, and they are not difficult to reach a consensus on all major issues, without the wolfish greed and beastly competition that divides the imperialists.

It is precisely because the Soviet Union firmly defends the principles of the inviolability of the sovereignty and national independence of all countries (regardless of their social system), and the foreign policy of the Soviet Union has received the support of the peoples of other countries and large and small countries.

The Soviet Union cannot underestimate the fact that India and Burma, together with the People's Republic of China, declared the five principles of peaceful coexistence between these countries (peaceful coexistence, non-interference in internal affairs, non-aggression, and others); the foreign policy of the Soviet Union has always been based on these principles, and these principles have now gained very friendly support throughout the world.

We have the right to ask the governments and parliaments of all countries: Why can't the few peaceful principles proposed by India and China in the June 28, 1954 declaration become the common platform for the peoples of all countries in the cause of maintaining and consolidating peace?

The peaceful policy of the Soviet Union also has many reliable friends in the capitalist camp.

You know who our friends are.

First of all, it is the working class, which does not want war anywhere, and in whose ranks there are always active fighters emerging to fight against war provocateurs and for the consolidation of international peace. Millions of peasants have also always supported the peaceful policy of the Soviet Union in the past and now, because war brings them only disaster and misery. In cities and villages far beyond the socialist camp, the movement to defend peace is developing and penetrating into all strata of the population, including the wealthy classes; the entire Soviet people are delighted by every genuine achievement of this movement to defend peace and to develop normal relations between countries.

As for the foreign policy of the United States and the countries that follow the foreign policy of the United States, in many cases, it is moving in the opposite direction.

The Soviet Union advocates the expansion of trade relations with other countries, advocates the development of international trade, while the ruling circles of the United States have a directly opposite policy. To obstruct the foreign trade of the Soviet Union, to block the economic ties of China with other countries, to obstruct, and if possible, even strangle the trade of democratic countries with those countries dependent on the United States, the United States has thought of every possible means. For these purposes, the American government and Congress have passed many laws and resolutions in recent years. American senators and ministers have made various speeches to threaten countries that do not comply. For these purposes, the United States has established a large number of supervisory committees to, my goodness, prevent any American, Chilean, British, Danish, West German, or Italian businessman from selling their goods to the Soviet Union or Bulgaria, China, or Hungary. In this regard, the United States has used pressure and direct orders to the extent that many manufacturers and businessmen are terrified and dare not develop trade with other countries.

But strangely enough, the United States still does not understand that this approach has not achieved the intended purpose.

Despite all these obstacles and the discriminatory measures taken by the American authorities against the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, trade with capitalist countries has not been interrupted. Not only that, but this aggressive policy has also accelerated the development of economic relations among democratic countries, which helps to strengthen the economic and political relations between democratic countries.

Among those who are particularly eager to obstruct the foreign trade of the Soviet Union, there are some American leaders who want to obstruct the post-war economic recovery of our country. They thought that the Soviet Union would need several decades to recover its pre-war economy. But the discussion of the state budget at this highest session of the Supreme Soviet is not again proving how shameful their miscalculation is?

In this regard, I only want to give an example to illustrate.

None of you doubt that the 1955 state budget and the national economic plan that have been passed will be successfully implemented. After the implementation of this year's national economic plan, our industry will reach more than three times the level of pre-war industrial production.

In addition, in agriculture, in the construction of collective farms and state farms, work is currently being carried out according to the recent decisions of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, which will lead to another unprecedented upsurge.

The new and truly exciting tasks set in this regard will require further great efforts from the Soviet state. But it is quite clear that the now even stronger collective farms and state farms will be able to accomplish these tasks, not to mention the great Soviet people who will provide the necessary support in the implementation of these important tasks.

As for trade relations, let everyone know this: we advocate the development of normal international trade, advocate fair economic cooperation.

If there is a fair economic competition between the capitalist system and the socialist system, what's wrong with that? Indeed, I dare say, in the mid-twentieth century, there is no better way to think of.

The aggressive policy of the United States in the economic sphere has led to various obstacles and discriminatory measures in international trade, and in the military-political sphere, this policy is mainly manifested in the establishment of various military-political blocs and aggressive alliances.

Everyone knows that in this regard, the most prominent is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization established by the Anglo-American bloc under the patronage of the United States, which includes the United States, Britain, France, Italy, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, Iceland, Portugal, Greece, and Turkey.

In addition, there are other military-political alliances established under the patronage of the United States.

In this regard, one can mention the various alliances established in recent years through different treaties or agreements in legal form, such as:

The treaty between the United States and Australia and New Zealand; the treaty between the United States and Japan; the Southeast Asia Treaty (Southeast Asia Treaty Organization); the treaty between the United States and the bankrupt Chiang Kai-shek; the treaty between the United States and the Lee Syngman fascist clique in Korea; the treaty between the United States and France, Bao Dai Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Everyone can clearly see the significance of these treaties and agreements signed by the United States, and these treaties and agreements aim to support Chiang Kai-shek, who is despised by the Chinese people, in some way, to support the Lee Syngman fascist clique in Korea, and to support Bao Dai, who is despised by the Vietnamese people.

The recent agreement between Turkey and Pakistan and the current agreement being prepared between Turkey and Iraq can also be included in the category of alliances established under the patronage of the United States.

The Paris Agreements stipulate the establishment of a Western European military alliance, which is to become the spearhead of the so-called North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In addition to France, Britain, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and West Germany, the Western European military alliance includes West Germany. There is no need to add anything more about this military alliance than what has been said above.

The treaty between Turkey, Greece, and Yugoslavia is quite peculiar because only two of these countries belong to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, while the third country, Yugoslavia, does not belong to this organization. However, the peoples of the Balkans cannot but express the corresponding vigilance and attention to this.

The military blocs and alliances that the United States is establishing in Europe are aimed at the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, and in Asia, they are aimed at the People's Republic of China and the peoples friendly to it. However, the problem is not just the establishment of blocs and alliances.

We must not underestimate the danger of the continuing arms race. In countries such as the United States, Britain, France, and some others, military budgets have already become very large. In the United States, military expenditures account for two-thirds of the entire federal budget, several times more than the expenditures in this regard before the war.

At present, the highly developed industry of the United States is mainly maintained by war orders. The output of the war industry accounts for twenty to twenty-five percent of the total industrial output of the United States, that is, almost a quarter. Despite this, economic crises and a decline in total output can still be felt in the United States.

Now is the time to acknowledge that a country's economy cannot be maintained for a long time on the unhealthy basis of war orders. However, the United States is implementing a suicidal policy of destroying international trade, which makes the American industry lose the normal channels of development and expansion.

Now the American government has been in a so-called "state of emergency" for the fifth year, which is not accidental. This is a state of emergency declared by the Democratic government of Truman and maintained by the current Republican government.

Recently, to maintain the war hysteria manufactured there, they have even gone a step further. They have launched a malicious campaign in the press and on the radio, and there have appeared various discussions not only about war in general but also about the preparation for atomic war in particular. The responsibility for this mainly lies with the American ruling circles. It is due to their insistence that the member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization held a meeting in Paris in mid-December 1954 to discuss the preparation for atomic war.

In order not to fall behind, some foreign ministers of certain countries have recently indulged in their own atomic war propaganda. For example, Belgian Foreign Minister Paul-Henri Spaak somewhat boastfully said at a press conference in Paris on December 18, 1954, that the decision made by the Atlantic Council "gave the military exactly what they needed. They needed permission to prepare for atomic war. This permission has been granted." He also used some ambiguous diplomatic language to talk about the so-called "hypothesis of the use of atomic weapons," and he shyly said: "The final decision and the means that make this decision possible (i.e., the decision to use atomic weapons) cannot be announced. They are a top military secret."

Recently, Spaak and Dulles have also started atomic war propaganda. Not only American generals like Radford, Gruenther, and Stevenson, but also the chattering British Field Marshal Montgomery have started this propaganda.

Is it that they want to prove that the recent plans and speeches of American politicians about the peaceful use of atomic energy are merely to divert the attention of the broad masses?

If there is a grain of truth in this assumption, it will double the damage to American foreign policy. One should not forget that, first of all, such a policy of double-dealing will undermine the confidence of the people in the government; secondly, the peoples of the world now regard today's atomic merchants as the main candidates for new major war criminals.

All this together, that is, the many obstacles in international trade set up by the United States, the aggressive war blocs, the many war bases established on the territories of other countries, the arms race, and the threat of atomic war—all this proves that the United States and the American national bloc are pursuing a "policy of strength" aimed at the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and the people's democracies. All this is to use the "position of strength" policy, that is, the policy of pressure and threats, to intimidate and confuse people. However, the entire nervous policy has brought too much damage to the American people themselves and cannot give the United States of America anything to strengthen its diplomatic position.

The American aggression bloc has miscalculated again. Just not long ago, they still thought that they had a monopoly on atomic weapons. Even those who saw further among them thought that the Soviet Union would need at least ten to fifteen years to produce atomic weapons, and most of them thought it would take much longer. However, Soviet scientists, engineers, technicians, and other directly related personnel have achieved results in a short time that demonstrate the extraordinary capabilities of the Soviet Union. Things have progressed to the point where the Soviet Union has achieved such success in the production of hydrogen weapons that it is not the Soviet Union but the United States of America that is falling behind.

Domestically, the current foreign policy of the United States is far from being universally supported.

The Republican Party no longer has a majority in Congress. After the autumn elections last year, the majority in the American Congress belongs to the Democratic Party. In this regard, it is not inappropriate to quote a segment of the words of the most prominent Democrat, the candidate for the presidency in the 1952 election, Adlai Stevenson. According to American newspapers, he said at a Democratic meeting on September 8, 1954: "Sometimes, I find it difficult to distinguish our policy from our statements and our slogans—those beautiful phrases and policy labels on the lips. We seem to have a policy of slogans—announced by Dulles, thundered by Nolde; this policy has no meaning, and its achievements are even less. You still remember 'liberation', 'freeing Chiang Kai-shek', 'seizing the initiative', the 'new face' of defense, 'massive retaliation', and all these stimulating bold slogans. These slogans have all been quietly put away, making our prestige and influence worse and worse... It is a sad thing that the unsightly infighting in Washington has caused a mood of despair in our allies. Worse still, the State Department seems to have fallen into paralysis. Secretary of State Dulles says that the times require a 'painful reassessment' of our foreign relations, and he is undoubtedly right. However, the problem is that in the atmosphere where the word 'negotiation' has become synonymous with 'betrayal', it is impossible to make a reasonable reassessment."

The above-mentioned assessment of American foreign policy is from such an authoritative person as the former presidential candidate, so it is worth noting. If this assessment has to some extent attracted the attention of the directly concerned people, it would not be a bad thing.

However, it should be said that such an assessment of American foreign policy is far from fully exposing the contradictions and actual situation that exist in this regard.

The fact is that the socialist and democratic camp is becoming more and more consolidated due to the consistency of their political goals and the great internationalist friendship between the working people, while the imperialist camp is disintegrating due to external and internal contradictions. All this inevitably reflects in foreign policy.

There are many examples that can convincingly illustrate this.

Here are some examples.

Everyone remembers the Geneva Conference. France, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union reached an agreement on this conference on the issue of restoring peace in Indochina, although the third partner in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the United States, did not want to sign this agreement. Indeed, the representatives of the United States, France, and Britain later reached some agreement at the Manila Conference to a certain extent. This time, France and Britain yielded to the opinion of the United States, and their actions in some respects were contrary to the decisions made at the Geneva Conference. Doesn't this show the existence of a series of contradictions in the imperialist camp, which sometimes manifest in one form, sometimes in another form, sometimes more seriously, and sometimes more lightly? It is clear that although the United States achieved some "success" at the Manila Conference, the political achievements of the Geneva Conference are incomparable in terms of their significance.

In May 1952, six Western European governments signed the so-called "European Defense Community" treaty under the pressure of the United States and Britain. However, in August 1954, the French Parliament rejected this treaty, and the plan to establish the "European Defense Community" thus collapsed. This treaty failed in the French Parliament because there was a great divergence between the will of the French people and the intentions of the French government. How should we assess the above situation? It is entirely reasonable to say that the collapse of the "European Defense Community" is the result of deep contradictions within the imperialist camp. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that this is a failure of American aggressive foreign policy.

After that, on October 23, 1954, the so-called Paris Agreements were signed, which was the second attempt to realize the remilitarization of West Germany. Things seemed to have been smoothly settled, and certain European governments and the American government had already calculated that they could achieve victory in the implementation of the plan to revive German militarism. However, in recent days, the French Parliament has begun to waver again, which will cause new difficulties for the supporters of the Paris Agreements. This reflects the impact of the increasingly sharp contradictions that have occurred in a corner of the military-political bloc under American manipulation. The events that have occurred in France in recent days, which led to a government crisis, prove that American foreign policy has suffered another failure.

Now let's see how diplomatic events were reflected in the United States during the presidential election in the fall of 1952.

Everyone knows that at that time, the Republican Party won the presidential election, advocating the so-called "liberation" policy of the people's democracies, although its tone was not confident. The Republican Party proposed this "liberation" policy to some extent in opposition to the policy of the Democratic Party, the majority of which advocated the implementation of a more moderate foreign policy, that is, the well-known "containment" policy, although there were supporters of these two political lines in both parties.

However, one should not forget that on the eve of the election, Republican presidential candidate Eisenhower promised to end the Korean War that the Democratic Party's Truman administration had dragged the United States into. This promise was basically decisive in the outcome of the presidential election.

The Democratic Party's defeat in the presidential election was not due to the fact that the Democratic Party advocated the implementation of a more moderate foreign policy, but because it was responsible for the Korean War it had launched. On the other hand, the Republican Party's victory in the presidential election was not because it announced a more aggressive foreign policy, but because it temporarily appeared as a party that did not promote the continuation of the aggression against Korea but promoted the end of the war and the restoration of peace in Korea.

We should also consider the contradictions that exist within the blocs and military blocs established by the imperialists, whether it is the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or any other bloc. In all these blocs, sometimes the tendency to launch new wars is strengthened; sometimes, on the contrary, the opposite tendency is strengthened. If in some countries, these opposing tendencies are in conflict, then this conflict will be even more reflected within these blocs or even between blocs.

Here, we should consider that the more organized and active the movement of the peoples of all countries to struggle for peace and to ease international tensions, the stronger and more frequent the aforementioned vacillations, especially the vacillations that are of great significance for easing international tensions, will be.

The examples quoted above are typical of the many contradictions within the imperialist camp, which are reflected in the relations between certain countries, in the policies of individual governments, and even within individual parties, which consider not only the will of millionaires and billionaires but also to some extent the opinions of the broad masses of voters.

The foreign policy of the Soviet Union cannot but take into account the fact that there are great contradictions not only between individual capitalist countries but also within these countries, or even within certain parties belonging to the capitalist class and groups, which not only consider the will of millionaires and billionaires but also to some extent the opinions of the broad masses of voters. Our task is to: utilize these contradictions to the benefit of maintaining and consolidating peace, to the benefit of weakening aggressive anti-democratic forces.

Our steadfast supporters of lasting peace and our enemies are separated by a chasm.

Our enemies are busy expanding military armaments. They do this in the hope of consolidating their political camp, but in fact, this only makes their economic and political positions inevitably decline and collapse.

The Soviet Union opposes the expansion of military armaments and, in implementing its peaceful policy, has proposed a large number of measures to reduce various types of armaments and unconditionally ban atomic weapons, and advocates the establishment of effective international control over the reduction of armaments and the prohibition of atomic weapons and all other weapons of mass destruction.

Our enemies openly lead to new wars and recently have been vigorously advocating the need to prepare for atomic war. However, this aggressive policy cannot obtain the support of their own people, and this policy not only meets with the opposition of the broad masses of the people but also encounters the opposition of a part of the wealthy class with relatively healthy thinking. The only result that their execution of this policy can obtain is that some of their political figures, who shout the loudest, have long been infamous both at home and abroad.

The Soviet Union is also on the opposite side regarding the atomic issue.

The Soviet government has already proposed to the American government to immediately conclude an agreement on the prohibition of the use of atomic weapons and the use of atomic energy only for peaceful purposes. The Soviet Union also actively supports the recent proposal of the World Peace Council to destroy the atomic weapons reserves of all countries, so that all the peoples of the world can believe that there will never be an atomic war. For this reason, the Soviet Union has shown great enthusiasm and initiative at the international conference on the peaceful use of atomic energy. We propose that the United States not compete in the production of atomic weapons but compete in the peaceful use of atomic energy.

Our enemies are shouting about the "policy of strength." On the one hand, they are anxious and restless, and on the other hand, they are making threats. They try to use threats and blackmail to intimidate those who are nervous and indecisive.

The Soviet government believes that those who use such clumsy means against the Soviet people are bound to miscalculate. They should know that if necessary, we are able to defend ourselves.

It is time to realize that in the balance of power between the Soviet Union and the United States, the situation has been completely determined.

If we compare today's Soviet Union with the United States, taking into account the entire population of the Soviet Union, its abundant material resources, all its external allies (here we should consider the moral and political support of the people of other countries for the policy of peace), that is, if we make a corresponding comparison between today's Soviet Union and the United States, then it is obvious that the Soviet Union is not weaker than the United States.

One cannot forget that the Soviet Union, compared with the United States, has an indisputable advantage: the peace-loving Soviet Union does not threaten anyone and does not interfere in the affairs of other countries, but it is defending the true cause of justice, which is deeply sympathized with by all the working people and all the oppressed peoples of the world, and this cause will not fail to be victorious.

What does the Soviet Union propose?

We propose that neither side adopt a policy of threats and intimidation. Threats and intimidation will not lead to any good results.

In addition, we believe that the side that truly believes in its strength will not advocate war. Those who believe in their strength, those who believe in their future, do not need to do this.

Any attempt to launch a new world war will inevitably be to the disadvantage of the aggressors. Because in our era, the level of awareness of hundreds of millions of people has reached such a degree that they will also, like all the Soviet people, firmly believe in the justice of their cause and will fight to the end against such evil aggression.

What will be destroyed is not "world civilization," no matter how much it will be damaged in a new aggression, but the decaying social system and the blood-stained imperialist foundation of this system. This system has aged, its aggressiveness is being condemned, and it is being rejected because of the exploitation of the working people and the oppressed peoples.

The foreign policy of the Soviet Union is based on the principle of the coexistence of different social systems advocated by Lenin. We adhere to these principles and want the peoples of all countries to live in peace and tranquility.

We adhere to these principles because it is entirely possible to guarantee peace and the freedom of the peoples of all countries, to guarantee peaceful relations between countries, and to guarantee greater achievements of human progress in the entire historical era under the conditions of coexistence.

We adhere to Lenin's principles of coexistence, and we adhere to these principles because we firmly believe in the strength of socialism, and we firmly believe that we have chosen the correct path to communism.

    国际局势和苏联政府的外交政策
    ——一九五五年二月八日在苏联最高苏维埃会议上的报告
    维·米·莫洛托夫
    一、国际局势的变化代表同志们：
    第二次世界大战结束以来已经有十年了。如果把目前的局面同战前的局面作一比较的话，那么，国际局势的变化今天就比以往任何时候都要更加明显突出。在第二次世界大战以前，苏联是处在资本主义包围圈中的唯一的社会主义国家。当时存在了四分之一世纪以上的时间的局面就是这样的。
    在战后，我们可以说，局势已经起了根本的变化。　　　
    今天的苏联和资本主义包围，同战前的苏联和资本主义包围已经不可同日而语了。如果有人以为可以同日而语的话，那就是说，没有注意到，或者至少是低估了整个国际局势中所发生的极端重要的变化。同时，不仅发生了量的变化，而且发生了质的变化。
    大家知道，第一次世界大战的最重要的结果是俄国通过革命转变成为一个苏维埃社会主义国家。在第一次世界大战和第二次世界大战之间的时期里，我国在社会主义经济的增长方面，在社会主义文化的发展方面取得了巨大的成就。早在战前时期，社会主义就已在我国获得胜利，但是，只是在第二次世界大战以后，苏联才摆脱了在国际上的孤立状态。
    第二次世界大战最重要的结果是，除了世界资本主义阵营之外，形成了以苏联为首的，更确切地说，是以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的世界社会主义和民主阵营。
    组成这个新阵营之所以成为可能，是由于法西斯的溃败、资本主义世界地位的削弱和民主运动空前进展的结果。我们的国家、苏联人民和他们光荣的军队在国际局势的这些发展中起了决定性的作用，这是有纪录可查的。
    在我们的时代里，苏联已不再处于大战前存在的国际形势中。今天，苏联已不再是世界上唯一的社会主义国家了。苏联在国际上孤立的状态已经是过去的事了。
    除了资本主义阵营以外，社会主义和民主阵营已经组成，把下面十二个国家团结在一起：苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟、中华人民共和国、波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利人民共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国、保加利亚人民共和国、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国和越南民主共和国。
    我们知道，我所列举的这些国家处在各自不同的发展水平，处在各自不同的社会转变的水平。和已经建立起社会主义社会的基础的苏联一道，还有朝着社会主义采取了只是初步的然而十分重要的步骤的各人民民主国家。
    但是，对民主阵营的所有国家来说，具有决定意义的是，它们已最后摆脱了地主和资本家当权的帝国主义体系。它们已经为自己选择了一条新的道路，并且已开始胜利地实行深刻的民主和社会主义改革，努力为这一切新的、伟大的建设保证和平和安全。
    这之所以成为可能，是由于在这些国家里，工人和农民连同一切劳动人民和民主力量已经在工人阶级的总的领导下组成了一个强大的政治联盟。正是由于有了这个把全体劳动人民团结起来的工农革命联盟，才有可能废除地主制度，把土地移交给农民，并把工厂、制造厂、铁路和银行转移到新的、真正民主的国家权力机关的手里。
    资本主义的锁链不是在一个地方而是在一条很长的战线上被打破了。继我国在一九一七年实现胜利的社会主义革命之后，由于第二次世界大战的结果，资本主义也在若干其他国家内遭到了失败。
    这些新的、人民民主类型的国家由于从资本主义桎梏下解放出来的人民的努力而取得的成就，是依靠了苏联军队对法西斯侵略者的胜利，和苏联对它们所正在进行的、引向社会主义的政治、经济和社会改革的始终不变的支援。但是，在目前，尽管苏联有着重要的意义和特殊的作用，（苏联的力量的基础是高度水平的重工业，以及整个工业和社会主义农业的不断发展。）社会主义阵营国家也在日益依靠相互的支援。
    由于国际局势的变化，社会制度之间的力量对比已经发生了有利于社会主义的肯定的变化，特别是在过去十年中。这是非常自然的事。
    难道今天的欧洲还同战前的欧洲相像吗？
    难道我们可以忽视由于上次世界大战的结果而在这里发生的巨大变化吗？跟苏联一起，其他一些国家已经坚决地从资本主义道路转到了社会主义发展和新生的道路上来，而且这些国家中没有一个愿意倒退，退回到资本主义，在一切能够客观地、没有偏见地推理的人看来，这难道不是很清楚吗？如果我们看一下具体事实和数字，就可以看出，在全部欧洲六亿左右的人口中，大约有一半，即三亿人不到一些，已经坚定地加入了社会主义和民主阵营。
    这意味着我们今天所看到的欧洲已经同战前的欧洲大不相同了。
    在目前的新欧洲，社会主义阵营国家的地位并不比资本主义阵营国家的地位弱。尤其重要的是，我们的社会主义阵营国家虽然有相当多的困难，而且在建设工作中并不是没有严重的缺点，但是，都在满怀信心地前进，不断巩固新的民主制度，并且把本国人民的文化和福利提高到更高的水平。
    亚洲也发生了新的局势。
    亚洲的人口大约有十四亿，占世界人口一半以上。今天，在亚洲，也有比总人口的一半少一些的人生活在人民民主国家中，这些国家已经脱离资本主义阵营，而且已经把建设社会主义作为它们的目标。
    只要说一下中国的情况就够了。在不久以前，中国还是一个半殖民地国家，它受到帝国主义国家残酷的束缚，而且被剥夺了取得本国领土统一的可能；现在，中国已经统一为一个伟大的国家，它已经走上了全面发展本国文化和经济的道路。值得指出的是，只是从共产党领导中国国家的时候起，这一切才成为可能。在中国人民最流行的歌曲当中，有一首歌曲中说：
    “他指给了人民解放的道路，
    “没有共产党就没有中国。”这决不是偶然的。
    难道这些事实及在朝鲜和越南开始的深刻的改革，不正是证明了在亚洲发生的根本变化吗？难道所有这一切不正是说明在战后期间内，在亚洲已经发生了具有最伟大的历史意义的革命性的变化吗？
    但是，亚洲的变化绝不限于上述国家。
    一个具有巨大历史意义的事实是：今天，殖民地的印度已不再存在，存在的是印度共和国了。这是表现战后亚洲发展的特点的局势中的一个重要转折。作为加强和平和各国人民友谊的事业中的一个新的重要因素，印度的国际威望正在不断提高。
    像印度一样，印度尼西亚和缅甸也摆脱了殖民统治的桎梏。我们希望巴基斯坦，锡兰和其他亚洲国家的人民将能找到走向真正的民族自由和经济复兴的道路。
    在四月间，也就是说再过两个月，在印度尼西亚万隆将举行亚非国家会议，预计将约有三十个亚洲和非洲国家参加这个会议。召开这样一个会议的事实本身就足以说明，在最近时期内，亚洲所发生的有积极意义的变化该是多么的大。
    在近东和中东也发生了不少的变化。
    我们不能说，譬如说，在阿拉伯东方各国，民族解放运动已经像在一些亚洲国家那样声势浩大。那里的国家，特别是拥有巨大的石油资源的国家，仍然受到染指于当地的石油和其他天然资源的所谓“西方”国家的摆布。在这些地方也常常发生这样的事情：政府的成立和变更完全取决于美国或英国石油公司和其他外国资本家的公司的意志。但是在那里，民族解放运动也在不断增长。
    非洲人民大部分仍然处在殖民主义压迫之下。可是十分明显，不久将不可能再像掠夺了非洲领土的帝国主义国家现在仍然在做的那样，随心所欲地压制非洲人民的民族解放运动了。
      可以这样说：北美和南美还没有走上欧洲和亚洲人民已经成功地走上的那样的历史道路，但是北美帝国主义想要用来使美洲和世界上其他部分隔开的“铁幕”，并不像看来那样的坚牢。根据垄断资本的“铁蹄”所作的打算也是徒劳的。早在半世纪以前，美国名作家杰克·伦敦就生动而尖刻地描述了这种垄断资本的压迫性的统治，预见到美洲人民将冒着怎样巨大的困难沿着真正进步和从资本主义的桎梏中得到解放的道路前进。
    无论如何，如果要谈第二次世界大战以后的时期，那末到现在为止，在美洲大陆上发生的变化是最不显著的，但是这里，在人民的生活的深处发展着的进步倾向的潜流也愈来愈使人感觉到了。这样一种局势并不能证明美国的“铁幕”有力量，也不能证明垄断资本正在用以压迫工人和农民的“铁蹄”特别可靠，倒是证明：美洲将必须克服它的政治发展中的现存的落后状态，它仍然必须赶上某些其他国家中的政治生活的发展。
    把目前的国际局势和战前的国际局势整个比较一下，我们可以看到在过去的十年到十五年间发生了多么重大的变化。我们对这些变化是不会感到遗憾的。
    因此，在估计整个现代国际局势时，目前主要世界力量的相互关系是有很大的重要性的。在这样做的时候，我们必须既不过高地估计也不过低地估计所发生的情况，以及局势发展本身的趋势。我们无论如何不能忘记这是一个伟大的具有历史意义的时期，这段时期到今天只不过三十七年稍微多一点。
    和战前相比，资本主义、资产阶级的地位大大削弱了。这难道可以否认吗？不，不能否认。而且很明显，所发生的这些变化是有利于社会主义的，有利于民主力量和社会主义力量的。
    第二次世界大战使得世界资本主义体系的总危机进一步加深了。这表现在另一个新的世界阵营已经出现，而和世界资本主义阵营同时存在。一个民主阵营已经建立起来，这个以苏联为首的阵营正在沿着建立社会主义的道路前进。这些都是事实，不管有些人喜欢或者不喜欢它们。
    上述的基本事件的经济后果是单一的、无所不包的世界市场的瓦解。大家知道，这个单一的世界市场已经不再存在了。目前存在着两个平行的、互相对立的世界市场。
    这一来，在第二次世界大战以后形成的两个政治阵营中的每一个阵营，都有它自己的相应的经济基础。这一切都说明资本主义总危机进入了一个新阶段，这个新阶段是从第二次世界大战的时候开始的，并且是第二次世界大战的结果。这个新阶段证明资本主义总危机大大加深了。
    国际局势中所发生的历史性变化的事实似乎是不能忽视的。然而，实际上情况并不总是如此。
    资本主义已经在人民群众的压力下被迫退却，在许多国家里，人民群众已经推翻了地主和资本家，由他们自己的人——工人阶级和农民的代表，城市和农村的民主力量掌握了政权。
    然而，帝国主义国家的统治阶级并不甘心接受这种新的局势。这首先适用于受百万富翁和亿万富翁统治的美利坚合众国。不用说，英国和其他帝国主义国家的大资本家同美国的大资本家并没有什么两样。
    他们的意愿是不难识破的。
    他们希望那些已经摆脱资本主义的桎梏的国家重新受资本的统治。帝国主义国家——特别是像美利坚合众国、英国等国家——目前执行的外交政策也可以证明这一点。
    不难理解，为什么美国统治集团——举例说——公开宣布他们的外交政策的主要目标正是所谓
  “解放”那些工人和农民已经取得胜利、劳动人民自己已经当权的国家。他们甚至大谈这种“解放”——容许我用这个字眼吧——正是意味着使它们重新回到资本主义天堂，或者用他们惯用的字眼来说，回到“自由世界”。
    他们认为资本主义制度是这样一个“自由世界”，在这个制度下，剥削者先生们感到非常“自由”，统治阶级可以“自由地”甚至是恣意地剥削劳动人民。
    他们希望把人民民主国家从革命的工农联盟所建立的国家政权下“解放”出来，而代之以他们所赞成的政权，也就是说推翻战后在那里建立的新的、社会主义的、民主的秩序，并且再度强迫这些国家接受他们十分宠爱的资本主义制度，剥削劳动人民的制度，资本家和地主进行统治的制度。
    他们希望先从他们认为他们的代理人可以比较迅速地活跃起来的国家着手。大家知道，例如一九五三年六月十七日在柏林就进行过这样一种尝试。然而全世界都知道，这种尝试是可耻地失败了。这本来可以作为对帝国主义侵略分子的一个教训，可是关于这种冒险勾当的宣传还在继续进行。
    侵略成性的帝国主义分子的贪心和他们的邪恶的反动迷梦不仅仅限于针对人民民主国家。他们还希望使我们的国家恢复资本主义。
    他们并不是常常公开这样说，但是他们的确是这样说的。
    譬如说，大家来听听被恰如其分地认为是最著名的帝国主义思想家之一的邱吉尔先生放肆到什么程度吧。直到今天，他还在一遍又一遍地谈到一种他自己所谓的“终生”念念不忘的想法，那就是“在摇篮时代绞杀布尔什维主义”的想法。
    这里是他关于这个问题的言论之一，这是他在一九五四年六月二十八日在华盛顿全国新闻俱乐部发表的：“我向诸位保证，我毕生是同这个（共产主义）斗争的真正杰出的人之一。如果我在一九一九年得到适当支持的话，我想，我们可能已经把共产主义绞杀在‘摇篮之中’了，但是每一个人都举手反对说，‘多可怕的想法啊’。”
    甚至到了一九五四年，在社会主义革命在我国取得胜利以后这么多年，邱吉尔先生还没有能够找到比说把共产主义绞杀在“摇篮之中”更加聪明的东西，虽然，看起来他要这样做已经太晚了。
    说真的，他是一个失去了好机会的人。
    我们现在并不反对嘲弄一下这种反苏推理的疯狂性。不过，我们可不能天真，共产党人，同所有苏联人民一样，决不能指望得到帝国主义者的好心或同情。
    邱吉尔的言论充满了对过去的怀念。一切新的事物都是他所不容的，他对于随着伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利而出现的而且成为各国人民争取工人阶级和所有劳动人民的真正解放、争取从资产阶级—地主的压迫下解放的伟大运动的一切新事物，都怀有不可调和的敌意。
    到现在为止的三十八年以来，邱吉尔先生一直在要求推翻社会主义制度——不论是在什么地方出现这种制度，大声吵嚷必须“在摇篮时代”“绞杀”这个新制度。
    他道出了帝国主义者心中一向怀有的愿望，这些帝国主义者只要一样东西：完全的统治，也就是说对全世界的统治。
    但是，如果说，人民自己已经选择了另一条道路，同资本主义一刀两断，走上了社会主义和人民民主的道路，那么怎样才能够达到这个目的呢？
    这个问题的答案是“实力地位”政策，也就是美英帝国主义所宣布的对外政治路线。这些国家的统治者们表现了最富侵略性的资本主义分子的愿望，坚决拒绝承认事实。
    他们不愿意承认人民自己决定自己的命运的权利，因而也就是不愿意承认人民抛弃旧的东西、铲除资本主义制度并建立他们自己的新的社会主义制度的权利。
    侵略成性的帝国主义分子的想法不同。他们不愿意承认人民摆脱资本主义桎梏的正当愿望，竭力要恢复资本主义在全世界的统治。正是这种原因决定了——举例说——美利坚合众国的外交政策方针，这个方针的目的是要恢复帝国主义在全世界的统治，推翻社会主义，推翻各人民民主国家中劳动人民的政权。
    就是这些目的成为美国的侵略外交政策的推动力。这个政策只能意味着准备另一次世界大战，一场目的在于恢复帝国主义在全世界的统治的战争。
    这一切意味着，新的东西是在同旧的东西进行激烈斗争的情况下产生的；社会主义除非击退和克服帝国主义及其代理机关的抵抗，就不可能在这一个或那一个国家中取得胜利。
    战后的国际形势就是这样。这种形势决定了最近几年主要事态发展的性质。
    二、外交政策的两条路线
    苏联和社会主义阵营的其他国家坚决地、满怀信心地维护人民所赢得的地位，正在努力继续不断地巩固这种地位，为它们的社会主义建设求得平静的、和平的环境。
    民主和社会主义阵营是一个和平的阵营。因此，它通常就叫做和平、民主和社会主义阵营。
    为了维护和平和社会主义的利益，苏联坚持它的缓和国际紧张局势的外交政策。
    民主阵营的一切国家都同苏联一道拥护这一缓和国际紧张局势的对外政治路线。
    和苏联的和平外交政策相对的，是表现在“实力地位”政策上的美国的对外政治路线。
    美国外交政策的侵略性质是极其明显的。
    因此，人民群众积极关心国际局势的发展还有什么奇怪呢？
    亿万男女密切地注意着局势的动向：局势是朝着足以加强和平的方向发展呢，还是相反地朝着足以增加另一次战争的危险的方向发展。没有任何东西比战争更影响人民的命运了，也没有任何东西比战争给人民带来更大的悲痛和苦难了。第二次世界大战夺去好几千万人的生命，更不要提人民所遭受的无可估量的物质损失。如果人类被投入了一次新的战争中，其后果会比第二次世界大战的后果不知要严重多少倍，难道还有任何人看不清楚这一点吗？
    在国际生活的事件中，苏联占据着特别的地位。
    苏联——社会主义取得胜利的国家，在争取和平和反对战争贩子的积极斗争中占据着光荣的地位。今天，苏联成了巩固和平和各国人民友谊的主要支柱。
    随着苏联、中华人民共和国以及所有人民民主国家的力量的增强，随着和平运动的规模在其他一切国家日益扩大，世界各国人民日益认识到：和平事业掌握在他们自己的手中，而且只要他们不放松努力，在必要时坚决把保卫和平的事业进行到底，他们就能够不使新的战争爆发，能够保卫和平。
    苏联认为自己的主要任务是：增强和平力量，促使国际紧张局势趋向缓和。
    苏联这一外交政策路线，最充分地符合维护和巩固和平的利益。同时，这种路线有助于揭穿战争贩子以及那些妄图凭仗“实力”的帝国主义力量的侵略计划和阴谋，它们所依凭的“实力”实际上已日益变为准备第三次世界大战的政策。目前，两种对立的外交政策路线的斗争正在发展。
    苏联外交政策的和平路线在民主阵营中和在各国民主阶层中得到越来越有力的支持；而美国外交政策的侵略路线则依靠不断地建立新的侵略性的军事同盟和军事集团，并且最近表现为公开地宣传和准备原子战争。
    同时还有这样一些国家，它们从经济上说基本上是和资本主义体系联系着的，但是它们在国际问题上表现出关心维护和平和缓和国际紧张局势。不应该低估了加强这样一种倾向的重要性。
    缓和国际紧张局势的政策意味着什么呢？
    对于这一点最好是根据事实来加以判断。可以举出去年的事件和今天的事件来做例子。
    由于苏联的坚持，在一九五四年一月底和二月上半月，法国、英国、美国和苏联四国外长在柏林举行了会议。
    在这个会议上，我们力求通过足以大大缓和国际关系的决议。我们曾要求所有四国坚决指责在西德复活军国主义的计划，并且力求柏林会议在召开世界普遍裁军会议的问题上取得进展。但是美国、英国和法国的代表在这方面不和我们合作。
    然而，柏林会议毕竟起了重要的和积极的作用。
    柏林会议的意义首先就是为中断了五年之久的大国国际会议重新打下了今后召开的基础，这对解决迫切的国际问题有重大的意义。至于柏林会议上通过的关于召开另一次会议（这一会议后来在日内瓦举行）的决议，大家知道，是取得了积极的成果的。
    大家知道，参加日内瓦会议的，除了法国、英国、美国和苏联之外，还有中华人民共和国以及与解决朝鲜和印度支那问题有关的国家的代表。如果说柏林会议的成就是作出了关于召开日内瓦会议的决定（尽管美国反对，包括中华人民共和国在内的所有五大国都参加了这次会议），那末日内瓦会议的积极结果就证明了中国参加这一会议是多么必要。
    日内瓦会议没有完全完成它的任务，因为它没有在解决朝鲜问题上取得进展。但是，在这次会议上达成了关于停止持续了八年的越南战争、以及关于停止老挝和柬埔寨的军事行动的协议。所以能够达成这些协议，首先是因为越南人民为争取自由和民族独立进行了奋不顾身的斗争。而这一斗争得到了其他各国人民的积极同情和支持。所有这一些都在日内瓦会议上得到了一定程度上的承认。
    美国曾经公开企图阻挠达成关于恢复印度支那和平的协议。无论美国国务卿杜勒斯以及美国副总统尼克松这些顽固地奉行“实力政策”的人都公开不要结束战争，反对满足越南人民的合法要求，而要继续进行战争，用武装镇压印度支那的民族解放运动。他们抱着一个使反对越南人民的战争“国际化”的计划，除法国外，企图把美国和英国也拖入这一战争；并且企图不惜一切地阻挠日内瓦会议达成协议。
    事情竟达到这种地步：美国国务卿杜勒斯甚至不想参加印度支那问题的讨论而示威似地离开了日内瓦。然而，美国显示它的侵略性的结果，除了使自己陷于孤立地位以外，什么目的也没有达到。
    日内瓦会议的结果被看作是侵略势力的失败，是和平力量的重大胜利。因为日内瓦会议促进了国际紧张局势的缓和及和平的巩固。
    但是，美国侵略集团并不想安静下来。日内瓦会议一结束，美国国务卿杜勒斯就在马尼拉（菲律宾）召开了自己的会议。召开这个会议的明显目的，就是阻挠日内瓦会议的决议的执行，而日内瓦会议的某些参加国不顾对它们的威信的影响，竟同意帮助这件侵略事情。
    在杜勒斯召开的马尼拉会议上签订了所谓“东南亚集体防务”条约，这个条约是美国、英国和法国这些殖民国家以及菲律宾、泰国和巴基斯坦等一些依赖它们的亚洲国家组成的军事集团。这个条约充满了扼杀亚洲的民族解放运动的打算，它的矛头明显地指向中华人民共和国；中华人民共和国的国际威望在日内瓦会议时期大大提高了，尽管各式各样反动派进行敌对活动。
    所有这一切说明了什么呢？
    说明：在目前情况下，有利于和缓国际紧张局势的步骤遭到了那些最富侵略性的集团的千方百计的反对，他们不愿意缓和紧张局势，而热衷于加剧紧张局势。这就是说，要缓和国际关系中的紧张局势，没有别的办法，只有对最富侵略性的势力和对他们的阴谋展开坚决的斗争，因此，这一斗争不仅不能放松，而且必须更加坚决、灵活和一贯地继续下去。
    目前在远东发生的事件也证明，侵略势力又企图大肆活动，来阻挠国际紧张局势的和缓。
    台湾和中国其他岛屿地区的事件不是说明这一点，又是说明什么呢？
    很难在帝国主义侵略史中列举出比最近几年来在这一地区所发生的事件更加无耻的事实了。
    台湾岛和澎湖列岛无可争辩地是中国的领土，其他属于中国的岛屿，那就更不用说了。美利坚合众国和英国所签署的一九四三年的开罗宣言、以及一九四五年的波茨坦公告都特别承认了这一点。此外，在日本的投降书中也肯定了这一点，日本在十九世纪末叶占领了这些岛屿，而根据投降书它已将这些岛屿归还中国。
    尽管如此，现在美利坚合众国还是侵占了这些岛屿，并且在那里用金钱来维持被赶出中国的蒋介石罪恶匪帮，准备利用蒋介石的雇佣军队来进攻中国。近来事情发展到这样的地步：美国总统和美国国会如此醉心于他们的“实力政策”，竟至于开始公开地用战争来威胁捍卫自己对这些岛屿的权利以及维护自己的民族荣誉和主权不容侵略者侵犯的中国人民。
    苏联在这一问题上的立场是明确的并且是大家都清楚知道的。
    我们认为台湾问题是中国的内政，而美国的强劫行为和它的战争威胁是侵略，如果联合国珍视它的威信的话，就应该无条件地对这种侵略加以谴责。由于美国方面的反对，中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利直到现在还没有恢复，这种情况是不能再容忍了。美国必须把它的一切武装部队、包括空军和海军从台湾和台湾海峡撤走。那时候在远东才会停止军事行动，才能确立和平。
    美国在台湾问题上的立场，造成对维护和平威胁，并且加剧国际紧张关系，而苏联在这方面采取的立场却有利于缓和国际紧张局势，并且目的是在于巩固远东的和平。
    当然，我们所说的那种缓和国际紧张局势，是不能靠破坏或是分割某个国家、某个民族的自由和民族权利而求得的，而是在保障和尽力加强这些民主权利的情况下求得的，各国、各民族生活中的进步的利益正是要求这样。
    上述的亚洲事件固然是十分重要的，然而不应当认为，欧洲的局面可以推到第二位。
    只要提一下巴黎协定，就可以说明在欧洲形成的局势的尖锐程度了。
    毋须证明，自从第二次世界大战结束以来，德国问题成了战后欧洲所有问题的中心。本来，战后的十年时间是足够用来商定解决德国问题的明确的道路和方法的。但是，事实并不是这样。
    在战争期间和战争刚刚结束时，反希特勒集团的一切国家都同意它们共同的主要任务，是保证德国发展成为一个统一、和平和民主的国家，但在战争结束后的头几年就已经看出来并不是所有这些国家都真正为这个目的而努力。对某些国家，譬如对苏联说来，这项任务过去和现在一直是他们在德国问题上政策的基础。对其他一些国家说来，这只不过是一纸空文，他们在这些文件上签了字，但并不想认真地履行他们所签署的协定。
    苏联过去和现在都在坚持履行在雅尔塔和波茨坦签订的国际协定的基本任务。这里指的并不是这些协定的某些条款，因为其中许多条款早已过时，任何人都不需要了。但是，如果我们珍视欧洲各国人民的和平和自由的利益的话，这些极重要的国际协定中所提出的基本问题，即使德国重新统一成一个真正爱好和平和民主的国家的问题，是不能从议程上抹掉的。这个问题在没有能够根据巩固欧洲和平的利益以及在应分地考虑到统一的民主的德国的民族复兴的利益的情况下得到解决以前，仍将一直存在。不断壮大的德国人民爱好和平的力量，把坚定不移地坚持着重新统一德国的事业的德意志民主共和国当作他们可靠的支柱。
    在这方面，还应当分析一下关于巴黎协定的问题。
    无论已经被否决的“欧洲防务集团”计划或是巴黎协定，其实质都可以归结为下面一点：这两个计划都是要替西德德国军国主义的复活和把军国主义化的西德拉入西方国家的侵略性的军事集团打开大门。两者没有什么多大的差别：原先是想把西德军队编入所谓“欧洲军”，而巴黎协定则规定把西德军队编入“西欧军”。这可以用这样一句话来比方：“山药不比萝卜甜，煤炭不比烟渣白。”所有这些都是直接违反四大国签订的、目的在于制止德国军国主义复活的著名的国际协定的，这还粗暴地违反了英苏条约和法苏条约。根据这两个条约，英国和法国有义务和苏联一道共同采取措施来防止德国侵略再起的可能，有义务不参加反对苏联的军事集团。美国、英国和法国正在蹂躏和苏联一起签订的极其重要的国际协定和条约，竭力要使巴黎协定得到批准和尽速实现。
    巴黎协定在欧洲各国议会中通过时遭遇到很大的障碍。
    只要指出这一点就够了，尽管那些不相信巴黎协定的必要性的人遭到巨大的外来压力和美国方面的许多威胁，在法国议会中投票赞成巴黎协定的议员终究只占少数。在英国议会中投票赞成巴黎协定的也只是少数议员。大家知道，工党议会党团决定在表决时全体弃权。就是在西德，所有主要的工会、工人阶级的党和群众组织（在一定程度上可以根据这些组织的态度来判断大多数德国人民的真正的情绪）都坚决反对巴黎协定和反对重新军国主义化，因为德国人民当然不能忘记两次世界大战给德国带来的最悲惨的结局。
    在这种情况下，硬搞出来的并且受到欧洲各国人民的谴责和排斥的巴黎协定还能有什么价值呢？然而，一旦巴黎协定被批准和付诸实施，也不能不充分估计到它的不良的和直接危险的后果。
    批准巴黎协定对欧洲各国人民的危险在于，这种协定不是为了巩固和平，而是为了策动战争。在那些力图和西德的疯狂复仇主义分子和军国主义分子勾结在一起的拥护“实力政策”的人中间，冒险分子难道会少吗？
    还必须考虑到，批准巴黎协定会给予德国人民的民族利益带来极其沉重的打击。
    巴黎协定一旦批准，就会成为解决德国问题的主要障碍，而使德国长期不能恢复统一。西德如果重新武装起来，如果变成一个军国主义的国家，德国的这一部分就不可能同德国的东部，即同爱好和平的德意志民主共和国统一了。有人说批准巴黎协定并不妨碍就恢复德国统一进行有成果的谈判，所有这种说法都只有一个目的：力图使各国议会通过巴黎协定，并为此目的而不惜利用一切手段来蒙混和欺骗舆论。
    和这相反，如果拒绝巴黎协定，并由法、英、美、苏四国达成相应的协议，那末今年就有可能进行全德自由选举，以求在和平和民主的基础上恢复德国的统一。苏联政府一月十五日就德国问题发表的声明的意思就是这样的。
    有人要法国人、比利时人、挪威人和其他国家的人相信：规定复活德国国防军的巴黎协定是保证他们的安全所必需的。有人在恬不知耻地欺骗他们，硬说西欧各国的安全受到从苏联和人民民主国家来的威胁，然而即使那些喋喋不休地发出这种言论的人也都知道，这是对我们爱好和平的祖国和对所有人民民主国家发出的卑鄙龌龊的诬蔑。但是，侵略政策的鼓吹者拥有大量发行的资产阶级报纸和每日从早到晚叫嚷不休的许多电台。他们掌握整个国家机构和成批资本家所雇佣的形形色色的代理人，这些人在出卖自己的荣誉和良心，每天都在任意散布令人憎恨的反苏谎言和诽谤，并且变得越来越厚颜无耻了，因为他们感觉到，他们的基础日益动摇了。
    三、苏联争取和平、争取保障集体安全的斗争
    任何诬蔑和任何虚构的臆测都不能够在各国人民面前掩盖一个事实，即苏联在为争取和平、争取保障欧洲集体安全而进行不断的斗争。
    苏联所提出的保障所有欧洲国家（不管它们的社会制度和国家制度如何）集体安全的条约草案，是大家都很清楚的。
    这个草案得到了欧洲许多国家的支持，在所有的国家中获得了热烈的反应，虽然其中有些国家的统治集团力图对苏联关于集体安全的建议保持沉默，而且经常地全盘歪曲这些建议的精神。
    苏联政府表示也愿意讨论其他关于欧洲集体安全的建议。为了这个目的，苏联政府曾经建议召开全欧会议，以便讨论苏联的方案和其他可能提出的关于保障和平和欧洲安全的建议。
    但是，苏联建议的反对者中，没有任何人提出过任何其他关于保障欧洲集体安全的方案。北大西洋集团各成员国政府竟拒绝参加讨论这个问题的全欧会议。
    同时它们说，它们所感觉兴趣的只是这样的条约，参加这一条约的只限于和北大西洋集团的参加国“属于同一思想体系”的国家。这就表明它们是多么无原则地对待它们自己参加联合国的行动，因为联合国建立的基础是承认一切国家不问其社会制度如何都可以权利平等地参加联合国这个原则。它们的这种言论还证明它们根本不想保证欧洲的和平和真正的安全，证明它们建立的军事集团抱着敌视苏联和人民民主国家的目的。
    它们拿建立一些国家反对另一些国家的军事集团的政策，来对抗苏联以保障欧洲一切国家（不问其社会制度如何）的和平和安全为目的的和平政策。因此它们应当对侵略计划和对它们的行动负责，它们的行动不是为了和平的利益，因而不是为了它们本国人民的利益，而是为了那些奉行侵略的“实力政策”、被正当地称为战争挑拨者的侵略集团和统治集团的利益。
    因此，苏联对巴黎协定的立场是十分明确的。这种立场是无隙可乘的。
    我们很明白，一旦批准巴黎协定之后，西德就要走上复活军国主义的道路，并且就会实际上落入德国复仇主义分子控制之下。应该说，法国爱国分子在听了爱德华·赫里欧的出色的演说之后，也会充分地体会到这样做法将会带来什么结果。
    既然，根据巴黎协定规定，重新军国主义化了的西德将同法国、英国、意大利和其他一些国家一起加入北大西洋集团和西欧军事联盟，那么，在欧洲就会形成新的局势；因为，在这之后新战争的危险就会大大加深。
    苏联和各人民民主国家不能不考虑到这一点，因为巴黎协定就是用来反对这些国家的。苏联人民和苏联军队真诚地爱好和平，然而他们也深刻地警惕着，决心捍卫自己的社会主义成果。如果侵略者过去也得到了他所应有的教训，那么，现在他不应当忘记苏联威力的无限增长，不应当忘记，我们军队里每一百人中就有七十七个是共产党员和共青团员。而共产党员和共青团员是特别懂得应当怎样来保卫共产主义成果免受侵略的。
    鉴于欧洲所形成的新的情况，苏联和为巴黎协定所反对的其他爱好和平的国家将不能等闲坐视。它们应当采取相应的措施，以便进一步巩固自己的安全和保证欧洲的和平。
    去年十二月二日闭幕的、并且发表了一致的坚决宣言的举世周知的莫斯科会议，已经明显地说明了所有这些事情。在这项宣言上签字的有：苏联、波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国、德意志民主共和国、匈牙利人民共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国、保加利亚人民共和国和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国。
    参加莫斯科会议的八国肯定地声明，巴黎协定一旦被批准，它们将采取一切必要的措施来加强它们的国际地位，来保障和平和欧洲安全。这要求我们拿出新的巨大的人力和物力。不过，军国主义老爷们，请放心吧，我们是不惜这样做的。
    在这些措施当中，首先就是筹备缔结莫斯科会议八国的友好合作互助条约。为了不耽搁时间，现在正在进行相应的磋商。为了回答正在建立中的那些有德国军国主义参加的新的军事集团和组织，我们将进一步团结我们的队伍，进一步加强我们的友谊，改进我们在各方面的合作，并且在必要时进一步扩大互助。
    在有重新军国主义化的西德参加的西欧军事集团一旦建立后，我们所不得不采取的那些措施中，还应当包括建立一个上述八国的统一的军事司令部的措施。所以要采取这个措施，是因为考虑到有必要加强苏联和其他爱好和平的欧洲国家的防御力量，以预防一切突然事变和意外事变。我们一建立起欧洲和平国家的统一军事司令部来，那末侵略集团可能也就会放弃冒险企图，会变得比较安静一些。
    我们公开地这样说，并且认为有必要向我国人民说明目前的形势。我们深信，人民是会正确地了解我们的。
    大家知道很清楚，各国人民能够认清正在发生的事情，就是最可靠地为和平利益服务，就是保障爱好和平的国家的安全的最好的保证。从上面所说的一切可以看出，苏联的外交政策是以维护和巩固和平为目的的。
    因此，我们争取采取有利于缓和国际紧张局势的措施，主张同别的国家进行有利于缓和国际紧张局势的谈判并达成协议。自然，是否有可能达到这些目的，完全要看另外一方是否也表示同样的诚意。
    我们和其他国家之间的关系，首先决定于发展这种关系能在多大程度上有利于巩固和平、有利于在一贯地遵守不干涉别国内政的原则的情况下维护和平。
    在美苏关系问题上能说些什么呢？
    美苏关系仍然有待改善。美苏关系是否有可能改善呢？完全可能。但是，要做到这一点，不仅需要苏联政府，而且也需要美国政府有这种愿望。
    同英国和法国的关系不久以前开始有了不坏的发展，但是后来碰到了暗礁，或者更正确一点说，碰到了巴黎协定及其复活侵略性德国军国主义的计划。如果不可挽回地走上批准和实施巴黎协定的道路，那就是说，英国和法国不仅不珍重它们同苏联在第二次世界大战中所缔结的那些条约，而且是直接地废除、勾销这些条约。这种后果是不可避免的，因为巴黎协定，既然替复活德国军国主义和把重新军国主义化的德国拖进反苏集团而打开大门，那就同英苏条约和法苏条约不能相容。
    请让我把我国同芬兰、挪威这样一些邻国的关系的发展拿来比较一下。
    我国和芬兰的关系是根据一九四八年的友好合作互助条约发展的。可以举出一些事实来证明我们两国的经济关系和政治关系的发展。以吉科宁先生为首的芬兰政府代表团去年访问莫斯科和以米高扬同志为首的苏联政府代表团到芬兰的答谢访问，进一步改善了以更好地互相谅解为基础的苏芬关系。
    至于说到苏联和挪威的关系，苏联不得不考虑到挪威已成为侵略性的北大西洋条约的成员国这个事实，而这个条约的活动的目的决不是为了巩固欧洲的和平。无论如何，挪威不应当忘记，苏挪两国保持睦邻关系不仅有利于我国，而且也有利于挪威的。
    我还要谈一下关于同土耳其、伊朗、阿富汗这样一些邻国的相互关系。
    谁不知道，苏联曾采取了一系列的步骤，谋求改善同土耳其的关系。然而土耳其当局仍旧坚持不符合正常的睦邻关系的立场，把自己的领土和沿岸领水变成了外国武装部队、特别是美国武装部队进行军事演习和军事示威的某种场所。苏联政府认为，土耳其和苏联的相互利害关系要求两国之间必须保持睦邻关系。
    同伊朗的关系显得有了一定的改善。经过长期谈判之后，苏联和伊朗就重要的疆界问题和财政问题签订了一项协定。我们希望：外国的侵略势力为了把伊朗拖进他们在中近东的侵略性的军事和政治集团而对伊朗不断施加的压力，不至于妨碍苏联和伊朗关系按照这一方向继续发展。
    我们同阿富汗的关系在正常地发展着，我们认为，这符合于两国的利益。
    我们十分满意地指出，苏联和印度间的友好关系有了进一步的加强。
    苏印两国的政治、经济和文化关系在顺利发展，这有助于使我们两国的互相尊重、互相真诚同情的人民更加亲密。
    最近，苏印两国签订了一个重要的经济协定。根据这一协定，苏联负责以优惠的长期贷款在印度建设一个大冶金工厂，这个工厂每年能产一百多万吨钢和相应数量的钢材。苏联将供应全部装备，给予必要的技术援助，包括派遣有高度水平的专家。我们非常乐意地答应了这些请求，因为印度冶金工业的发展将有助于保障这个苏联各族人民全心全意同情的古老的和伟大的国家的民族独立和经济发展。
    印度总理贾瓦哈拉尔·尼赫鲁今年夏天将访问苏联。尼赫鲁先生将访问苏联的消息在苏联人民中得到了极其友好的反应。
    我们同另外两个亚洲国家——缅甸和印度尼西亚的关系也在继续加强中。
    可以指出，除伊拉克外，苏联和阿拉伯各国之间的关系近来出现了积极的因素。
    至于伊拉克同苏联断绝关系，这可以说，主要是由于伊拉克现任政府过分急于按着“西方”帝国主义者的笛音跳舞。阿拉伯国家的人谅必知道：苏联人民对这些国家是怀着友好的感情的，苏维埃国家过去和将来都是他们保卫自己的主权和民族独立的可靠支柱。
    大家知道，苏联在致力于使苏日关系正常化。
    苏联最近同日本政府建立了直接的接触。我们希望由此产生相应的积极结果。
    苏联非常重视解决奥地利问题，重视解决根据维持和巩固欧洲和平的利益完全恢复民主奥地利的独立的问题。
    苏联政府认为，缔结对奥和约方面的任何继续拖延都是没有理由的。同时，不能不考虑到像巴黎协定之类使西德重新军国主义化的计划会带给奥地利的那些危险。
    根据上述一切，苏联政府有理由对奥地利问题作出下列结论：
    （一）首先必须注意到，研究奥地利问题的解决办法不能脱离德国问题，尤其是当现在有着使西德重新军国主义化的计划，因而加深德奥合并的危险的时候，更是如此。
    这就是说，在缔结关于恢复独立的、民主的奥地利的对奥和约的时候，应当寻求一个能够消除德国实行新的德奥合并的可能性的解决办法，而这点是同四国就德国问题采取一致同意的相应措施有关系的。在这种情况下，不必等到缔结对德和约，四国军队的撤出奥地利就可能实现。
    （二）奥地利应当承担这样的义务：不参加目的是反对曾经用自己的武装部队参加反希特勒德国战争和参加解放奥地利的任何一个国家的任何集团或军事联盟，并且不得准许在自己的领土上建立外国军事基地。
    美国、英国、法国和苏联四国政府在这方面也应该承担履行上述规定的义务。
    （三）为了早日解决奥地利问题，必须立即召开四国会议来讨论德国问题和缔结对奥和约的问题。当然，奥地利也应参加对奥和约问题的解决。
    同时，必须注意到，替复活西德军国主义开辟道路的巴黎协定一旦批准，就会形成德奥合并的严重威胁，也就是对奥地利独立的威胁。
    大家知道，在苏联和南斯拉夫之间的关系方面最近获得了成绩。
    我们不认为，在这方面一切已经做了，但是我们认为，这也同样取决于南斯拉夫。看来，南斯拉夫近几年来在某种程度上离开了它在第二次世界大战以后的最初几年所采取的立场。这当然完全是它的内部事情。苏联力求发展苏南两国的经济、政治和文化关系。同时我们竭力在保证和平和国际安全这样的对各国人民有决定性意义的事业中尽可能地协调彼此的努力。我们确信，在发展苏南关系中的积极方针既符合苏联的利益，也符合南斯拉夫的利益。
    现在我要谈谈苏联同波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚这些人民民主国家以及同德意志民主共和国之间的关系的发展。同这些国家的关系正在兄弟友谊和全面合作以巩固和平和增进广大人民群众的幸福这个基础上顺利发展。
    在东方，我国同中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、蒙古人民共和国及越南民主共和国也发展着这种兄弟友谊和广泛合作的关系。
    我们同伟大的中华人民共和国之间存在着一年年加强的友谊和兄弟关系。
    以尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫、尼·亚·布尔加宁、阿·伊·米高扬、尼·米·什维尔尼克等同志为首的苏联政府代表团去年访问了中国，并且在经济合作以及在国际事务的合作方面签署了重要的文件，这件事鲜明地体现了我们两个伟大的国家之间新型的社会主义的关系。
    无论同上述的国家或是同其他一切国家，苏联都极力要保持一种能够促进世界和平和国际安全的关系。我们非常高兴地指出，欧洲和亚洲的人民民主国家都全力地支持这个政策，并且和苏联一道坚决地执行着和缓国际紧张局势的政策。
    苏联和各人民民主国家在政治、经济、文化等一切方面建立了友好的合作，这种合作还在不断地加强。这种合作的基础是大家坚持不渝地尊重国家主权和民族独立的原则。当然，在必要的时候，这种合作也扩大到加强所有这些国家的国防力量方面。
    然而，苏联和社会主义阵营的国家从来没有、而且现在也没有建立任何反对其他国家的军事集团。它们今后也不会这样做，但是如果有人要实行侵略计划，并且希望借助这种计划来复活德国军国主义，准备进攻爱好和平的国家，那么它们就会不得不联合它们的力量，以保障自己的安全。
    社会主义阵营的国家到现在为止还没有必要把它们的军事力量联合起来。它们之间在一切方面的必要的一致，过去和现在一直是通过事务的接触、合作和互助来取得的，牢不可破的友谊和兄弟关系把它们的这些活动紧紧地结合在一起。
    结果，拥有九亿人口、包括苏联和各人民民主国家的十二个国家，形成了一个团结的和平、民主和社会主义阵营。在这些国家中掌握政权的是劳动人民，他们是不难在一切重大问题上取得一致的，没有像存在在帝国主义者之间的那种狼性的贪婪和野兽的竞争来分裂他们。
    正由于苏联坚决维护世界和平以及各国（不问它们的社会制度如何）的主权和民族独立各项原则的不可侵犯性，苏联的外交政策得到了其他各国人民和不分大小国家的支持。
    苏联对这样一个事实不能低估：印度和缅甸同中华人民共和国宣布了这些国家之间进行和平合作的五项原则（和平共处、互不干涉内政、互不侵犯及其他等）；苏联的外交政策就始终是以这些原则为基础的，这些原则现在在全世界已经获得非常亲切的支持。
    我们有权利向各国的政府和议会问一句：为什么印度和中国在一九五四年六月二十八日的声明中提出的这几项和平原则，不能成为各国人民在维护和巩固和平的事业中的共同纲领呢？
    苏联的和平政策在资本主义阵营各国中也有许许多多可靠的朋友。
    你们知道，我们的这些朋友是谁。
    首先是工人阶级，他们不希望任何地方有战争，在他们的队伍中不断地涌现为反对战争挑拨者、为巩固国际和平而斗争的积极战士。千百万农民对苏联的和平政策过去和现在也一直是给予友好的支持，因为战争除了带给他们灾难和不幸之外，再也不会带来什么。在远远超出社会主义阵营范围以外的城市和乡村，保卫和平的运动日益发展，深入到一切居民阶层，包括富有阶级在内；苏联全体人民对于这一争取和平、争取发展各国之间的正常关系的运动的每一个真正的成就，都感到欢欣鼓舞。    至于美国的外交政策和循着美国外交政策路线走的那些国家的外交政策，在许多情况下都是朝着相反的方向走。
    苏联主张扩大同其他国家的贸易关系，主张发展国际贸易，而美国统治集团则对苏联和其他民主国家抱着直接相反的方针。为了阻挠苏联的对外贸易，为了封锁中国同其他国家的经济联系，为了阻挠，只要有可能，甚至扼杀民主国家同那些依属于美国的国家的贸易，美国什么办法都想到了。为了这些目的，美国政府和国会最近几年来通过了许多各种各样的法律和决定。美国的参议员和部长们发表了各种各样的演说，来威胁那些不顺从的国家。为了这些目的，美国建立了一大堆各种各样的监督委员会，以便，我的天哪，不让任何美国的、智利的、英国的、丹麦的、西德的或者意大利的商人把他们向外推销的商品卖给苏联或者保加利亚，中国或者匈牙利。在这方面，美国采取了施加压力和直接命令的手段，以致吓得许多制造商和商人胆战心惊，不敢同其他国家发展贸易。
    但是，奇怪的是，美国至今还没有了解，这种做法并没有达到预定的目的。
    尽管有这一切阻碍以及美国当局对苏联和各人民民主国家采取的歧视措施，这些国家同资本主义国家的对外贸易并没有中断。不仅如此，这种侵略政策还促成了民主阵营国家的经济关系的加速发展，从而有助于加强民主国家之间的经济和政治关系。
    在那些特别热衷于阻碍苏联的对外贸易的人中间，有一些美国首脑一心想阻碍我国战后的经济恢复工作。他们以为苏联需要几十年的时间才能恢复它的战前经济。但是这次最高苏维埃会议上关于国家预算的讨论，不是又一次证明他们的错误估计是多么丢脸吗？
    在这方面，我只想举一个例子来说明。
    你们当中谁也不怀疑所通过的一九五五年国家预算和国民经济计划将能胜利执行。在执行了今年的国民经济计划以后，我国的工业将达到我国战前工业产量三倍多的水平。
    此外，在农业中，在集体农庄和国营农场的建设中，现在正在按照共产党和苏联政府最近的决议，进行着将导向又一次空前高涨的工作。
    在这一方面规定下来的新的、实在是令人兴奋的任务，将需要苏维埃国家的进一步的巨大努力。但是十分明显，现在已经变得更加强大的集体农庄和国营农场能够完成这些任务，更不必说伟大的苏联全体人民在完成这些重要任务时将给予应有的支持。
    至于贸易关系，让大家知道这一点：我们是主张发展正常的国际贸易，主张正当的经济合作的。
    如果在资本主义体系和社会主义体系之间开展正当的经济竞赛的话，那有什么不好呢？的确，我敢说，在二十世纪中叶，再想不出比这更好的其他办法了。
    四、美国的侵略政策是对和平的威胁
    在经济范围内，美国的“实力政策”促成在国际贸易中的各式各样的障碍和歧视措施，在军事—政治方面，这种政策的主要表现是建立各种各样的军事——政治集团和侵略性的联盟。
    大家知道，在这方面突出的是由英美集团建立起来的在美国庇护下的北大西洋集团，其中包括美利坚合众国，英国，法国，意大利，加拿大，比利时，荷兰，卢森堡，丹麦，挪威，冰岛，葡萄牙，希腊和土耳其。
    此外，还有也是在美国庇护下建立的其他的军事—政治联盟。
    关于这些，可以提一提近几年来通过不同的条约或协定的法律形式而建立起来的各种联盟如下：
    美国跟澳大利亚和新西兰订的条约；美国跟日本订的条约；东南亚条约（东南亚条约组织）；美国跟破产了的蒋介石订的条约；美国跟朝鲜的李承晚集团订的条约；美国跟法国、保大越南、老挝和柬埔寨订的条约。人人都看得很清楚，跟美国订的这些条约和协定的意义何在，这些条约和协定的目的是要以某种方式支持为中国人民所唾弃的台湾的蒋介石，支持朝鲜的李承晚法西斯集团以及为越南人民所不齿的保大。
    最近土耳其和巴基斯坦缔结的协定以及目前土耳其和伊拉克正在准备缔结的协定，也可以归入在美国庇护之下建立的这类联盟之内。
    巴黎协定规定建立一个西欧军事联盟，这个联盟是要成为所谓北大西洋集团的突击队的。西欧军事联盟除了包括法国、英国、意大利、比利时、荷兰、卢森堡以外，还包括西德。关于这个军事联盟的情形，除了上面所说的以外，不需要再作任何补充了。
    土耳其、希腊和南斯拉夫缔结的条约非常奇特，因为其中只有两个国家属于北大西洋集团，而第三个国家南斯拉夫并不属于这个集团。不过巴尔干的人民对于这一点不能不表示相应的警惕和注意。
    美国正在欧洲建立的军事集团和联盟，其矛头指向苏联和人民民主国家，在亚洲——指向中华人民共和国和同它友好的人民。但是，问题并不止于建立集团和联盟。
    我们决不能低估继续不断地进行军备竞赛的危险。在诸如美国、英国、法国和其他某些这样的国家，军事预算已经非常庞大。在美国，军事费用占全部联邦预算的三分之二，比战前这方面的支出大好几倍。
    目前美国高度发展的工业的产量水平，主要靠战争订货来维持。战争工业的产量占美国工业全部产量百分之二十到百分之二十五，那就是说差不多占四分之一。尽管如此，经济危机和总产量的下降，在美国还是可以觉察得到的。
    现在是承认一个国家的经济不能长期在战争订货这种不健康的基础上维持下去的时候了。但是，美国正在执行一种破坏国际贸易的自杀政策，这种政策使得美国工业失掉了发展和扩充的正常途径。
    现在美国政府已经是第五年使美国处于一种所谓“紧急状态”了，这并不是偶然的。这是由杜鲁门民主党政府开始宣布，而由目前的共和党政府保持下来的。
    近来，为了保持在那里制造出来的战争歇斯底里气氛，他们的做法甚至又进了一步了。他们在报刊和电台上发动了一个恶意的运动，出现了不仅是一般关于战争、而且是特别关于准备原子战争的各种各样的谈论。这种做法的责任主要落在美国统治集团身上。由于他们的坚决主张，北大西洋公约组织的成员国才在一九五四年十二月月中在巴黎开会讨论准备原子战争的。
    由于不愿落在别人后面，某些国家的外交部长近来耽溺于他们自己的某种原子战争宣传中。
    例如，比利时外交大臣斯巴克一九五四年十二月十八日在巴黎的一次记者招待会上多少有些自夸地说，大西洋理事会日前作出的决定“给了军方恰好他们所需要的东西。他们需要允许他们准备原子战争。这种允许已经给予了”。他还使用了某种含糊的外交词令，谈到了所谓“使用原子武器的假设”，他羞答答地说：“最后的决定和使得作出这个决定
  （即使用原子武器的决定）成为可能的手段是不能宣布的。它们是一个头等军事秘密。”
    最近斯巴克和杜勒斯都搞起原子战争宣传来了。不仅美国将军雷德福、格仑瑟和史蒂文森之流搞这种宣传，而且爱唠叨的英国元帅蒙哥马利也搞起这种宣传来了。
    难道他们是想借此证明，美国政治家们最近关于和平利用原子能的计划和演说只是为了要分散广大公众的注意吗？
    如果这种设想里面有一点点真理的话，它将双倍地损害美国的外交政策。不应该忘记，首先，这样一种口是心非的政策将动摇人民对政府的信心；其次，世界各国人民现在已经把今天的某些原子贩子看作是新的主要战犯的候选人了。
    所有这一切加在一起，也就是说，美国在国际贸易方面设下的许多障碍、侵略性战争集团、正在其他国家领土上建立的许多战争基地、军备竞赛和原子战争的威胁——所有这一切都可以证明，美国和美国国家集团是在奉行着矛头指向苏联、中华人民共和国和人民民主国家的“实力政策”。所有这一切都是为了要利用“实力地位”政策，也就是利用施加压力和进行威胁的政策来吓唬人、来困惑人。但是，整个这种神经过敏的政策给美国本国人民带来的损失太大，而且不能给美利坚合众国以任何东西来加强它的外交地位。
    美国侵略集团又一次失算了。就在不久以前，他们还以为他们对原子武器保持完全的垄断。甚至他们当中看得比较远的人们在战后最初几年中也认为，苏联至少需要十年到十五年才能制造原子武器，而他们当中大多数人认为需要更加长得多的时间。但是，苏联的科学家们、工程师们、技术人员们和其他一切直接有关的人员，在短时间内就获得了表明苏联的异常的可能性的成果。事情已经进展到这样程度：苏联人在氢武器制造方面已取得了如此的成就，以致落在后面的不是苏联，而是美利坚合众国了。
    在国内，美国目前的外交政策也远不是得到普遍支持的。
    共和党已不再在国会中占有多数。在去年秋天举行选举后，美国国会中的多数已经属于民主党。在这方面，援引一段美国最显要的民主党首脑、一九五二年总统选举中民主党提名的候选人史蒂文森的话不是不相宜的。据美国报纸报道，他在一九五四年九月八日一次民主党会议上说过这样的话：“有时候，我觉得很难把我们的政策同我们的声明和我们的口号——那些漂亮的词句和挂在嘴上的政策——分开来。我们似乎有着口号政策——杜勒斯加以宣布，诺兰大发雷霆；这种政策没有任何意义，而其成就更少。你们还记得‘解放’，‘放蒋介石出笼’，‘夺取主动权’，防务的‘新面貌’，‘大规模报复’等等这一切刺激人的大胆招牌吧。这些招牌都已一一悄悄地收起来了，使得我们的威望和影响每况愈下……够伤心的事是，华盛顿内争的不体面的丑事已在我国的盟国中间造成了沮丧的情绪。更糟的是，国务院似乎已陷于瘫痪。国务卿杜勒斯说，时代要求‘忍痛重新估计’我们的外交关系，他这话无疑是对的。但是，问题在于，在‘谈判’这个字眼已变成了‘背叛’的同义字的气氛中，要作合情合理的重新估计是不可能的。”
    上面所引述的对美国外交政策的估计，是出自前总统候选人这样一个有资格的人之口，因此是值得注意的。如果这个估计已在一定程度上引起直接有关的人的注意倒不是一件坏事。
    但是，应当说，对美国外交政策作这样的估价还远没有完全揭露这方面现有的矛盾和实际情况。
    事实是，社会主义和民主阵营由于自己的政治目标的一致和劳动人民之间的伟大的国际主义友谊而日益巩固，但帝国主义阵营则由于外部和内部矛盾而分崩离析。这一切不可避免地反映在外交政策上。
    有许多例子可以令人信服地说明这一点。
    下面就是一些例子。
    大家记得日内瓦会议。法国、英国、中国和苏联在这个会上就恢复印度支那的和平的问题达成了协议，虽然北大西洋集团中的第三个伙伴，即美国，不愿意在这个协定上签字。诚然，美国、法国和英国的代表后来在马尼拉会议上在某种程度上取得了协议。这一次法国和英国顺从了美国的意见，它们的行动在某些方面是违反它们也参加作出的日内瓦会议的决定的。这难道不正说明帝国主义阵营中存在着一连串的矛盾吗，这些矛盾有时表现为这样一种形式，有时表现为另外一种形式，有时表现得严重一点，有时表现得轻微一点。很明显，尽管美国在马尼拉会议上取得某种“成就”，但是，日内瓦会议的政治成果就其意义来说，是马尼拉会议那一点可怜的成果所无法比拟的。
    一九五二年春天五月间，六个西欧国家政府在美国和英国的压力下签订了关于建立所谓“欧洲防务集团”条约。但是，一九五四年八月法国议会否决了这一条约，因而建立“欧洲防务集团”的计划就此完蛋了。这一条约在法国议会中所以会遭到破产，是因为在法国人民的意志和法国政府的意图之间发生了极大的分歧。应该如何估计上述情况呢？完全有理由说，“欧洲防务集团”的破产是帝国主义阵营中深刻矛盾的结果。另一方面，不能不认为，这是美国侵略外交政策的一次失败。
    在这以后，在一九五四年十月二十三日签订了所谓巴黎协定，这个协定是想要实现西德重新军国主义化的第二次企图。事情似乎已经顺顺当当地办妥了，某些欧洲国家和美国的政府已经盘算着能在执行复活德国军国主义计划中取得胜利。但是最近几天法国议会又开始表示动摇了，这会替巴黎协定的支持者造成新的困难。这里反映出了在美国操纵下的那个军事—政治集团的一个角落里所发生的日益尖锐的矛盾所产生的影响。最近几天法国所发生的导致政府危机的事件证明，美国的外交政策又遭到了一次失败。
    现在请看一看，外交事件在一九五二年秋天美国总统选举时在美国国内得到了什么样的反映。
    大家知道，当时在总统选举中获胜的是共和党，它当时主张所谓“解放”人民民主国家的政策，尽管它的声调是没有信心的。共和党提出这个“解放”政策在某种程度上是和民主党的政策相对立的，民主党的大多数主张执行比较温和的外交政策，就是大家所知道的“遏制”政策，虽然在这两个政党中都有支持这两种政治路线的人。
    但是，不应忘记，在选举开始的前夕，共和党总统候选人艾森豪威尔应允结束民主党的杜鲁门执政时美国被拖进去的朝鲜战争。这一诺言在基本上决定了总统选举的结局。
    民主党在总统选举中失败，并不是由于民主党主张执行比较温和的外交政策，而是由于它应对它所发动的朝鲜战争负责。从另一方面来说，共和党之所以在总统选举中获胜，并不是因为它宣布了更富侵略性的外交政策，而恰恰相反，是因为它暂时以一个不是促进继续侵略朝鲜，而是促进结束战争和恢复朝鲜和平的政党出现了。
    我们应该也考虑到帝国主义者所成立的集团和军事集团中所存在的矛盾，不论是北大西洋集团也好或是其他任何集团也好。在所有这些集团中，有时是加紧发动新战争的倾向加强；有时恰恰相反，是反过来的倾向加强。假如在某些国家里，这种对立的倾向在进行着斗争，那么这种斗争在这些集团内部或甚至集团之间就尤其会反映出来。
    这里，我们应该考虑到，各国人民争取和平和争取缓和国际紧张局势的运动越是有组织、越是积极地在一切国家展开，上述那种动摇的情况，特别重要的是那些对缓和国际紧张局势有重大意义的动摇情况，就越是强烈，就越是频繁。
    上面所引述的例子在帝国主义阵营内部许许多多矛盾中是具有典型性的，这些矛盾反映在某些国家之间的关系上，反映在个别政府的政策上，甚至反映在个别的政党内部，这些政党不仅考虑百万富翁和亿万富翁的意志，而且不得不在某种程度上也考虑广大的选民群众的意见。
    苏联的外交政策不能不考虑到，不仅各个资本主义国家之间有很大的矛盾，而且在这些国家内部，或甚至某些属于资本主义阶级和集团的政党内部也存在着矛盾。我们的任务是：利用这些矛盾，以利于保持和巩固和平，以利于削弱侵略性的反民主力量。
  五、我们的主要任务——巩固和平
    我们持久和平的拥护者同我们的敌人之间有着一条鸿沟。
    我们的敌人在忙于扩充军备。他们这样做是指望巩固自己的政治阵营，而事实上，这却使他们的经济和政治阵地不可避免地日渐衰落和崩溃。
    苏联反对扩充军备，而在执行自己的和平政策，提出了大量裁减各种军备和无条件禁止原子武器的建议，并且主张对裁减军备和禁止原子武器及一切其他大规模毁灭性武器建立有效的国际管制。
    我们的敌人公开地在导致新的战争，最近又在大力鼓吹必须准备原子战争。但是，他们这种侵略政策决不能得到本国人民的拥护，这种政策不仅遭到广大人民群众的反对，而且也受到一部分思想比较健康的富有阶级的反对。他们执行这种政策所能得到的唯一结果是：他们那批政治人物中某些叫嚣得特别厉害的人，在自己国内和国外都早就声名狼籍了。
    苏联在原子问题上也是站在相反的立场的。
    苏联政府已经建议美国政府立即缔结一项关于禁用原子武器，将原子能仅用于和平目的的协定。苏联也积极支持世界和平理事会最近的建议，即销毁各国的原子武器储备，使全世界人民都相信永远不会发生原子战争。正因为如此，苏联在召开关于和平利用原子能的国际会议上表现得非常乐意和积极。我们建议美国不要在生产原子武器方面进行竞赛，而是在和平利用原子能方面进行竞赛。
    我们的敌人在高嚷“实力地位”政策。他们一方面焦急不安，同时又在进行恫吓。他们企图采用威胁和讹诈来慑服那些神经衰弱的人和不坚定的人。
    苏联政府认为，那些对苏联人民采取这样拙劣的手段的人是必然要失算的。他们应当知道，如果有必要的话，我们是能够保卫自己的。
    现在该是明白的时候了：在苏联和美国的力量对比中，局面已经完全肯定了。
    如果拿苏联的全部人力、丰富的物质资源，它的所有的外部同盟者（这里应该考虑到其他国家的人民群众对和平政策在道义上和政治上的支持），也就是说拿今日的苏联和美国作相应的比较，那就很明显，苏联并不比美国弱。
    还不能忘记，苏联和美国相比还有一个无可争辩的优越性，爱好和平的苏联不威胁任何人，也不干涉其他国家的事务，但是它是维护着真正正义的事业，全世界劳动人民和一切被压迫的人民都热烈同情这个事业，这个事业是不会不胜利的。
    苏联建议的是什么呢？
    我们建议无论哪一方面都不要采取威胁和恫吓的政策。威胁和恫吓是不会导致任何好结果的。
    此外，我们认为，真正相信自己力量的一方是不会主张战争的。那些相信自己的力量的人，那些相信自己的未来的人是不需要这样做的。
    进行任何发动新世界大战的冒险，其结果不可避免地是不利于侵略者的。因为在我们的时代里，已经有数以亿计的人民的觉悟水平已经达到了这样的程度：他们也已经和全体苏联人一样，将会深信自己事业的正义性，将为反对这样的罪恶侵略而斗争到底。
    要毁灭的不是“世界文明”，不论它会在一场新的侵略中遭到多少破坏，毁灭的将是那个已经腐朽的社会制度和这个制度的浸透了鲜血的帝国主义基础。这个制度已经衰老了，它的侵略性在受人谴责，并且由于对劳动人民和被压迫人民的剥削而在遭人摒弃。
    苏联的外交政策是以列宁的不同社会制度共处的原则为基础的。我们坚持这些原则，愿各国人民能够过和平安宁的生活。
    我们坚持这些原则，因为在共处的条件下完全有可能在整个历史时代中保障和平和各国人民的自由，保障国与国之间的和平关系，保障人类进步的更大成就。
    我们坚持列宁关于共处的原则，我们坚持这些原则是因为我们深信社会主义的力量，我们深信我们已经选定了通向共产主义的正确道路。
