The national state-owned sundries export trade system organized the export of more than 100 new types of industrial products in 1954, with a total value that could be exchanged for more than 179,300 tons of steel, or more than 4,720 vehicles with a carrying capacity of six tons, or more than 320,000 tons of fertilizer, or more than 3,420 sets of 54-horsepower tractors.

Before liberation, our country relied entirely on foreign imports for many industrial products, but in the short five years after liberation, thanks to the achievements of New China's economic construction, many industrial products are not only self-sufficient but also able to be exported in large quantities. Such as chemical raw materials like glycerol, sodium sulfide, calcium sulfate, sodium sulfide, various medicines like ephedrine hydrochloride, medicinal castor oil, cough medicine, ammonium nitrite, etc., small hardware, machinery, and electrical products like nails, galvanized lead wire, wood screws, active ore, coils, soldering irons, printing presses, tea machines, electric hosiery machines, and daily necessities and cultural and educational supplies like accordions and violins, last year were not only sold to Southeast Asia and Africa, but also to the Western European market. Some commodities, such as various types of paper and glass, were exported in large quantities last year.

In addition, the state-owned export trade system also organized the export of new varieties such as wool, blankets, wool yarn, linen, knitwear, shirts, various towels, scarves, and cigarettes last year. These commodities are very popular in fraternal countries.

In order to expand export materials, many new commodities suitable for foreign sales were also trial-produced last year, such as 36-inch wide printed linen and floral fabrics, and 42-inch grey cloth, which were very popular in the international market after trial production. Some commodities have been exported in large quantities after changing their specifications and improving their quality. Now the export trade system is working with industrial departments to study how to reduce production costs and improve technical levels in order to organize the export of industrial products in large quantities.

    我国已有许多工业品出口
    全国国营杂品出口贸易系统，一九五四年组织了一百多种工业品新品种出口，总值可换回钢材一十七万九千三百多吨，或载重量六吨的汽车四千七百二十多辆，或肥田粉三十二万多吨，或五十四匹马力的拖拉机三千四百二十多套。
    解放前，我国有许多工业品完全依靠国外进口，但是在解放后短短的五年中，由于新中国经济建设上的成就，有许多工业品，不但已能自给，并能大量出口。如甘油、硫化碱、硫酸钙、硫化元等化工原料，盐酸麻黄素、药用蓖麻油、咳嗽药、亚硝酸铵等各种药品，钉子、镀锌铅丝、木螺丝、活动矿石、线圈、电烙铁、印报机、茶叶机、电动织袜头机等小五金、机器和电机制品以及日用百货和文教用品手风琴、手提琴等，去年不但已销往东南亚、非洲，并且已远销西欧市场。有些商品如各种纸张和玻璃去年已有大量出口。
    此外，国营出口贸易系统去年还组织呢绒、毛毯、毛线、亚麻布、针织品、衬衣、各种毛巾、头巾、纸烟等新品种出口。这些商品，很受兄弟国家的欢迎。
    为了扩大出口物资，去年还试制了多种适销国外的新商品，如三十六吋宽幅的印花麻纱和花布及四十二吋的坯布试制后很受国际市场欢迎。有的商品经改变了规格和提高质量后，就有大量出口。现在出口贸易系统正和工业部门共同研究降低生产成本，提高技术水平，以大量组织工业品出口。
