    Receipts Without Official Stamps
    To the Editor:
        Between December 10th and 18th of last year, the Anshan Branch of the People's Bank of China's Business Department accepted the commission of the Bayan Grain Bureau to collect five grain payments from the Anshan Grain Bureau. However, due to unclear procedures, the Anshan Grain Bureau refused to pay freight charges amounting to 115,401,100 yuan. On December 17th, it accepted the commission of the Shangzhi Grain Bureau to collect a grain payment from the Anshan Grain Bureau, of which 7,534,800 yuan in freight charges were refused. On December 25th, it accepted the commission of the Zhenlai Grain Bureau to collect a grain payment from the Anshan Grain Bureau, of which 22,448,000 yuan in freight charges were refused. Similar incidents occurred when the Chengde Grain Bureau, Ningcheng Grain Bureau, Dehui Grain Bureau, and Shanhetun Forestry Bureau, among others, handled the collection of payments for goods. The main responsibility for this phenomenon lies with the dereliction of duty by the staff of the relevant railway stations in Bayan, Shangzhi, Zhenlai, etc., who failed to affix the station's official stamp and the clerk's personal chop on the "Goods Transportation Document" copy (which clearly states: "Attention! This copy is invalid without the station's and clerk's stamps"). Naturally, the Anshan Grain Bureau cannot lightly trust such receipts without official stamps and rashly make payments, and therefore refuses to pay these freight charges.
    However, due to the refusal to pay freight charges, the grain-issuing units cannot recover the advanced funds in a timely manner, expanding credit quotas, damaging the policy of accelerating capital turnover, and disrupting the financial plans of enterprises.
    It is recommended that transportation departments and consigning units constantly prevent similar errors from occurring.

    没有公章的单据编辑同志：
    中国人民银行鞍山分行营业部在去年十二月十日到十八日先后接受巴彦粮食局的委托向鞍山粮食局收回五笔粮款，但其中因手续不清而被鞍山粮食局拒付货物运费的达一亿一千五百四十万一千一百元。十二月十七日接受尚志粮食局的委托向鞍山粮食局收回一笔粮款，其中被拒付货物运费七百五十三万四千八百元；十二月二十五日接受镇赉粮食局的委托向鞍山粮食局收回一笔粮款，其中被拒付货物运费二千二百四十四万八千元。其他如承德粮食局、宁城粮食局、德惠粮食局、山河屯森林工业局等在办理托收货款时都发生类似事件。这种现象所以产生，主要责任在于巴彦、尚志、镇赉等有关的铁路车站工作人员工作失职，在“货物运送单”抄件上漏盖车站公章和经办人手戳（这个抄件上写明是：“注意！本抄件未经车站及经办人盖章无效”），鞍山粮食局当然不能轻信这种没有公章的单据而贸然付款，拒绝支付这些运费。
    但是，由于拒付运费，发粮单位便不能及时收回代垫费用，扩大了信贷指标，损害了加速资金周转的政策，破坏了企业单位的财务计划。
    建议运输部门和托运单位要时刻防止类似错误的发生。
