Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 3rd, TASS dispatch: A United Press dispatch indicates that U.S. President Eisenhower mainly discussed U.S. Far East policy at a press conference on the 2nd. Eisenhower attempted to portray the U.S.'s blatant interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China and its acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China as a policy of "promoting peace." Some reporters wanted to know whether the resolution passed by Congress authorizing the U.S. President to use armed forces to carry out the so-called task of ensuring the security of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands would actually lead to war. In response to their questions, Eisenhower said that the United States intends to continue occupying Taiwan and other Chinese islands.

Xinhua News Agency, February 4th, New York Dispatch: The "New York Post" published a Washington dispatch by columnist Robert Allen on January 25th, stating that U.S. Secretary of State Dulles said at a closed-door meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Military Committee that the joint resolution of the U.S. Congress authorizing Eisenhower to use armed force to interfere in China's internal affairs could essentially be interpreted as a "pre-written declaration of war."

Dulles also said that Britain agreed with the current U.S. approach to the Taiwan issue. He said that although British Foreign Secretary Eden was somewhat "reluctant," he still supported the U.S. position.

Xinhua News Agency, February 4th: Following the recent activities in Taiwan by U.S. Pacific Commander Stump, U.S. Far East Air Force Commander Partridge arrived in Taiwan on the 3rd. Partridge is in Taiwan to arrange the activities of the U.S. Air Force stationed there.

According to Reuters, Partridge met with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek on the afternoon of the 3rd, suggesting that the U.S. Air Force should give the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique greater assistance. They also discussed future arrangements between the U.S. Air Force and Chiang's bandit air force.

Partridge inspected the U.S. Air Force units occupying Taiwan. It has been previously reported that at least one U.S. Air Force wing has recently arrived in Taiwan and is constantly conducting provocative flights over the Chinese coast.

    艾森豪威尔向记者表示
    美国打算继续侵占我国台湾
    美远东空军司令到台湾活动
   【新华社讯】塔斯社华盛顿三日电：合众社的一则电讯表明，美国总统艾森豪威尔在二日的记者招待会上谈的主要是美国的远东政策。艾森豪威尔企图把美国悍然干涉中华人民共和国内政的做法和对中华人民共和国的侵略行为说成是一种“促进和平”的政策。有些记者希望知道，国会所通过的准许美国总统使用武装部队来执行所谓确保台湾和澎湖的安全的任务的决议实际上会不会导向战争，艾森豪威尔在回答他们的问题时说，美国打算继续占领台湾和其他中国岛屿。
    【新华社四日讯】纽约消息：“纽约邮报”一月二十五日刊载专栏作家罗伯特·艾伦的华盛顿消息说，美国国务卿杜勒斯在国会参议院外交委员会和军事委员会的秘密会议上说，美国国会两院授权艾森豪威尔武装干涉中国内政的联合决议，在实质上可以被解释为“预先写好的宣战书”。
    杜勒斯还说，英国同意美国目前在台湾问题的做法。他说，虽然英国外交大臣艾登多少有些“不太情愿”，但还是支持了美国的立场。
      【新华社四日讯】继最近太平洋美军总司令斯图普到台湾进行活动之后，美国远东空军司令帕特里奇又在三日到达台湾。帕特里奇是来安排驻台湾的美国空军的活动的。
    据路透社报道，帕特里奇三日下午会见蒋介石卖国贼时，建议美国空军给予蒋介石卖国集团以更大的援助。他们还讨论了美国空军和蒋贼空军之间将来的安排问题。
    帕特里奇视察了侵占台湾的美国空军部队。前已报道，美国空军至少一个联队已经在最近到达台湾，并且不断在中国沿海上空进行挑衅性的航行。
