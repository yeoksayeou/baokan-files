Oil Camellias Can Bear Fruit Four Years Earlier
Zhao Qi
Tu Jin-di, the mutual aid team leader of Ye Shan-tou Natural Village, Ming Shan Township, Yong Feng District, Xuan Ping County, Zhejiang Province, uses the cutting method to propagate oil camellias, which can bear fruit four years earlier. This is a very good method for increasing oil production.

Tu Jin-di’s experiment began in 1950. That year, around the “Qingming” Festival, he inserted 127 oil camellia branches on the hillside of Pan Jin Mountain. 98% of them survived and grew very well. According to the investigation conducted last year by the Quzhou Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the Xuanping County People's Government, these oil camellias propagated by cutting generally have well-developed root systems and grow well, with an average plant height of 2.66 feet and an average crown width of 4.81 feet. Among them, 26 plants have flowered and borne fruit, which is about five years earlier than those propagated by seed in the local area. Among the fruit-bearing trees, one tree bears 61 tea pods (fruits), which is equivalent to the number of fruits borne by a general ten-year-old oil camellia tree.

Oil camellia is one of China's important oil crops. This crop has a wide range of adaptability and can be grown in most areas of subtropical South China and the Yangtze River Basin. The fruit of the tea tree has a high oil yield. The oil has a wide range of uses. Oilseed cakes can be used as fertilizer. This oil crop can be developed in large quantities in mountainous areas without competing with cotton, grain, and other crops for land.

Oil camellias take seven or eight years to bear fruit (in the Yangtze River Basin), making it impossible to obtain benefits quickly.

Tu Jin-di's propagation method can shorten the time it takes for oil camellias to start bearing fruit to four years. By bearing fruit four years earlier, the country can obtain oil four years earlier, and farmers can obtain income four years earlier. This is significant in terms of gaining time.

Tu Jin-di's time for inserting oil camellia branches is around "Qingming," which is still more than a month away. Areas preparing to plant oil camellias on a large scale can use this method to plant, or select key points for testing, and it is still in time.

    油茶可以提早四年结实
    赵起
    浙江省宣平县永丰区明山乡叶山头自然村的互助组长涂金地，用扦插方法繁殖油茶，可以提早四年结实。这是一个很好的增产油料的方法。
    涂金地的这个试验是在一九五○年开始的。那年“清明”时节，他在当地潘金山腰部扦插了一百二十七株油茶枝条，有百分之九十八成活了，并且都长的很好。据浙江衢州专署和宣平县人民政府去年派员调查结果：这些用扦插方法繁殖的油茶，一般根系发达，生长良好，平均株高二尺六寸六分，树冠幅围平均四尺八寸一分；其中二十六株已开花结实，比当地用种籽繁殖的，提早了五年左右结实。已结实的树中，有一株结有六十一个茶蒲（果实），相当于一般种植十龄的油茶树的结实数。
    油茶是我国重要的油料作物之一。这种作物的适应性很广，在华南亚热带和长江流域多数地区都能种植。茶树果实的产油率较高。油的用途也很广泛。油饼可以做肥料。这种油料作物可以在山区大量发展，不和棉粮等作物争地。
    油茶要七、八年结实（在长江流域），无法很快获得收益。
    涂金地的繁殖方法能把油茶开始结实的时间缩短到四年。它提早四年结实，国家可以提早四年得到油料，农民可以提早四年获得收益。这在争取时间上说，是有意义的。
    涂金地扦插油茶枝条的时间是“清明”前后，距现在还有一个多月，准备大量种植油茶的地区，运用这种方法种植，或选择重点进行试验，是来得及的。
