    Great Development in Freshwater Fish Production in Hubei
    Hubei Province has seen great development in freshwater fish production. Currently, the area used for stocking fish in mass-owned ponds and reservoirs and state-owned lakes has expanded to 650,000 mu. The maximum yield per mu in mass-owned ponds and reservoirs has increased from around 100 jin to over 600 jin, and the yield per unit area in state-owned lakes has increased from 30-40 jin to over 60 jin. From last autumn to the end of the year, preliminary statistics from the three special districts of Huanggang, Xiaogan, and Jingzhou along the Yangtze River and around the lakes show that over 300 million jin of fish have already been produced. Now is the peak production season, and it is estimated that around 500 million jin of fish can be produced from last autumn to this year's wheat harvest.
    In order to support mass production, the state has not only provided loan assistance but has also established 46 breeding farms, 3 fry supply stations, 1 breeding company, and more than 20 cured fish processing plants. In addition, more than 1,400 new fish ponds have been opened. With the help of the state, fish farming has become a reliable sideline production for the majority of farmers. There has also been great development in mutual aid and cooperative organizations in the fishing industry. The number of fishery mutual aid teams has increased from 94 in 1953 to more than 3,800, and the number of cooperatives has increased from 7 to more than 110, with the organization reaching 32% of the total number of households.

    湖北淡水鱼生产有很大发展
    湖北省淡水鱼生产有很大发展，目前群众塘堰和国营湖泊放养的面积已发展到六十五万亩。群众塘堰每亩单位面积最高产量由百斤左右上升到六百斤以上，国营湖泊放养单位产量由三四十斤上升到六十斤以上。从去秋到年底止，据黄冈、孝感、荆州三个沿江滨湖专区初步统计，已产鱼三亿余斤，现在正是生产旺季，估计从去秋到今年麦收前约可产鱼五亿斤左右。
    国家为了扶持群众生产，除给予贷款帮助外，并建立了四十六个养殖场，三个鱼种供应站，一个养殖公司和二十多个腌鱼加工厂等，此外还新开鱼池一千四百多个。在国家这些帮助下，群众养鱼已成为广大农民可靠的副业生产。渔业中的互助合作组织也有很大发展。渔业互助组已由一九五三年的九十四个发展到三千八百多个，合作社由七个发展到一百一十多个，组织面达到总户数的百分之三十二。　（杨森）
