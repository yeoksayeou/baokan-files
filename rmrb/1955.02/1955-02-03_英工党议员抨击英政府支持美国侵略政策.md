Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd Dispatch from London: British Members of Parliament continued to question Prime Minister Churchill about the Taiwan issue on the 1st. Some Labour MPs criticized the government's ambiguous attitude towards fulfilling its obligations under the Cairo Declaration. The MPs also expressed concern about the British government's support for the US policy of armed intervention in China's internal affairs.

    Labour MP Sorensen pointed out that the Cairo Declaration, personally signed by Churchill, stipulated that Taiwan should be returned to China. He asked to what extent this declaration was still the policy of the British government.

    In his reply, Churchill acknowledged that the Cairo Declaration did make such a provision. However, he then disingenuously described this international agreement as "merely containing a declaration of common purpose." He attempted to justify the act of abandoning the Cairo Declaration and disregarding good faith, saying that "the Taiwan issue has become an international issue closely related to several other countries." Churchill also attempted to obliterate China's sovereignty over Taiwan by using the excuse that the San Francisco "Treaty of Peace with Japan" did not specify the ownership of Taiwan.

    Sorensen pointed out that this policy was unfounded according to the provisions of the Cairo Declaration. He asked, since Britain has recognized the People's Government of China, does this not guarantee that Taiwan should be handed over to the control of the People's Government?

    Churchill refused to answer this question directly.

    Labour MP Silverman pointed out that Churchill had "clearly indicated" that everyone considered Taiwan to be part of China, and asked him to clarify what the real problem was. Churchill again refused to answer.

    At the same time, some MPs also expressed concern about the US Congress granting Eisenhower special powers to launch a war of aggression against China.

    Labour MP Hughes questioned, "Can the Prime Minister make it clear and inform President Eisenhower that Britain does not intend to participate in the development of the situation in the Far East?"

    Churchill refused to answer this question. He said, "I don't think it is my business to convey such a message through any means." In answering another question, Churchill even insisted that Britain's support for the US aggression was in order to "strive for a peaceful solution."

   Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd, Dispatch from TASS, London, February 1st: According to Reuters, Churchill and Eden spoke again today at the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. Their speeches yesterday were aimed at gaining the Prime Ministers' support for the British government's attitude towards the US's aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China. Today, Churchill and Eden tried to defend Britain's policy of remilitarizing West Germany and pulling it into an aggressive military bloc in Europe. Churchill and Eden said that approving the Paris Agreement was the most important thing for the policies of Western countries.

    英工党议员抨击英政府支持美国侵略政策
   【新华社二日讯】伦敦消息：英国下院议员一日继续就台湾问题向首相邱吉尔提出质询。一些工党议员抨击政府对履行开罗宣言的义务方面的暧昧态度。议员们并且表露出对英国政府支持美国武装干涉中国内政的政策感到不安。
    工党议员索伦森指出，邱吉尔亲自签署的开罗宣言规定台湾应该归还中国。他问，这个宣言在多大程度上仍旧是英国政府的政策。
    邱吉尔在回答时承认，开罗宣言是作了这样的规定。但是，他接着别有用心地把这项国际协议说成是“仅仅包含了一种共同目的声明”。他企图为背弃开罗宣言的不顾信义的行为辩解，说什么“台湾问题已经变成了一个若干其他国家都密切有关的国际问题”。邱吉尔并且企图借口旧金山“对日和约”未规定台湾谁属来抹煞中国对台湾的主权。
    索伦森根据开罗宣言的规定指出这个政策是没有根据的。他问道，英国既然承认了中国人民政府，这难道不就是保证台湾应当交还给人民政府控制吗？
    邱吉尔拒绝正面答复这个问题。
    工党议员锡尔弗曼指出邱吉尔曾“明白表示”每个人都认为台湾是中国的一部分，并且要求他澄清真正问题所在。邱吉尔又拒绝答复。
    同时，一些议员也对美国国会授给艾森豪威尔对中国发动侵略战争的特别权利，表示忧虑。
    工党议员休斯质询说，“首相能否表示明白并且使艾森豪威尔总统知道英国是不打算参与远东的事态发展的？”
    邱吉尔拒绝答复这个问题。他说，“我以为通过任何途径来传达这种消息不是我的事情。”邱吉尔在答复另一个问题时还硬把英国支持美国的侵略行动说成是为了“争取和平解决”。
   【新华社二日讯】塔斯社伦敦一日讯：据路透社报道，邱吉尔和艾登今天又在英帝国联邦总理会议上发言。他们昨天的发言是为了争取总理们支持英国政府对美国反对中华人民共和国的侵略行动的态度。今天，邱吉尔和艾登努力为英国在欧洲的使西德重新军国主义化和把它拉入侵略性军事集团的政策进行辩护。邱吉尔和艾登说，赞成巴黎协定对于西方国家的政策是最重要的一件事。
