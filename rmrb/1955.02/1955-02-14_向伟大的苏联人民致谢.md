    A Salute to the Great Soviet People
    Chen Yi
    The Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe left the great Soviet land more than a month ago. In this month or so, we have been constantly recalling the unforgettable days we spent in the Soviet Union. We think of the places we visited, the people we met, and especially the sincere and unforgettable friendship that those people gave us.
    There is no people in the world more dear to us Chinese people, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, than the great Soviet people. The Soviet border guards we encountered on the Soviet border, although they did not say a word, that smile – that smile completely from the heart when looking at Chinese comrades wearing "August 1st" five-star cap badges, and when our train passed in front of them, they saluted us with their guns, the sidelong eyes, the slight movement of the lips, the knowing smile they sent us, isn't this a more intimate expression than that between brothers? Our comrades couldn't help but shout, "Red Army," "Red Army."
    "Red Army," this is the most respectful and dearest title we have had for the heroic sons of the great Soviet people since the beginning of our history. However, this was only our first contact with the great Soviet people and their heroic sons.
    Later, from Otbor in the Far East to Moscow, and from the famous Brest in the west to Moscow, although it was summer at first and later winter, the great Soviet people and their heroic sons did not treat us any differently because of the change in climate. The colder it was, the warmer they seemed. Even in the severe cold of minus forty degrees Celsius – when even breathing feels a bit rapid for ordinary people – they still rhythmically played "Moscow-Beijing" or the national anthems of China and the Soviet Union. It was especially touching that in cities like Kazan and Saratov, where we were only passing through and the train didn't even stop for ten minutes, the local working people and Soviet soldiers were waiting for us in the heavy snow, dancing in national costumes at the station. Their only hope was to see the representatives of the great six hundred million people (as they called us), to see their dearest Chinese brothers. In Sverdlovsk, the representative of the president of the Kirov Metallurgical Industry College, representing more than 20,000 students, said to us: "You can refuse to perform for us, but you cannot refuse to be our guests, and you cannot refuse to accept our gifts." The teachers and students of the whole school prepared a beautiful and precious box made of Ural gemstones for us. We had no reason to refuse. We want the friendship between our two countries to shine forever like the Ural gemstones.
    We have visited Moscow University and the Stalin Automobile Factory. The workers and students welcomed us so warmly, and they all felt the greatest regret for not being able to see our performance. Vladivostok, Sevastopol, Odessa, and many other places telegraphed us to come. They knew about us from the radio broadcasts. Those cities we had visited, like Brest, Minsk, Kiev, Kharkov, Leningrad, Moscow, Stalingrad, as well as Sverdlovsk, Novosibirsk, Irkutsk, and Chita, everyone said that we stayed for too short a time. The chairman of the Kiev City Soviet said, "You should stay here for at least two months." The people of Leningrad surrounded our car and wouldn't let us leave. In the theater, we took ten curtain calls and still couldn't get off the stage. Finally, the actors and the audience embraced and danced together. And all these places sold standing tickets.
    In Moscow, we were even more honored to be able to perform at the State Bolshoi Theatre. We believe that this is the most supreme honor that the Soviet government and people have given us. Every member of our troupe deeply understands the significance of this performance and feels that it is an unforgettable event in their life.
    Ivan Yakov, chairman of the Stalin Collective Farm in the Dimitrov District, 40 kilometers outside Kiev, a guerrilla fighter in the Chapayev unit, represented the people of the entire district to invite us to visit, and they specially cleared the highway covered with heavy snow for us. How touching this is!
    In Kharkov, at the same time, a sock factory, a bicycle factory, and a sickle and hammer factory invited us to visit and gave us gifts.
    The Brest Fortress garrison, which was the first to resist the invading German invaders in World War II, the Nakhimov Naval School in Leningrad, the Suvorov Military Academy in Kiev, and the Guards Tank Unit, which defended Moscow and fought from Moscow to Prague, all invited us to visit. They all introduced their heroic history and achievements to us in detail, and the students also gave us performances.
    In Minsk, the glorious Soviet army and its leaders invited us to participate in the Artillery Day and gave them a celebration performance. Our excellent actors were invited to the rostrum. The Chinese People's Liberation Army March and the Soviet Army Song were drowned out by applause during the performance, which fully demonstrated the deep brotherly friendship between the armies of China and the Soviet Union.
    We also visited several factories that used to produce or are producing machines to support our country's socialist construction. The workers posted slogans in the workshops: "Strive to complete the production tasks for Chinese orders ahead of schedule."
    Wherever we went, we were surrounded by crowds, pulled, hugged, and sometimes even lifted high. What is most unforgettable is that in the heroic cities of Stalingrad, Leningrad, and Moscow, the weather was freezing and foggy, but there were always many people at the station to welcome us. Our train and hotel doors were always crowded with people. When we visited the Winter Palace, the Pavlov battle site, and the underground railway, people followed us, and some people automatically explained to us. No matter whether we understood or not, they kept gesticulating and saying.
    Those great artists, including the general director of the State Bolshoi Theatre, five-time Stalin Prize winner Baratov, Soviet People's Artist, four-time Stalin Prize winner Gogoleva, and composers Zakharov, Muradeli, Alexandrov, All-Union People's Artist Dankevich, Badozhinsky, Kayedaev, Gormelia, Rakhlin, and many meritorious actors and meritorious art groups, performed for us, trained us, and processed our programs. They completely regarded our performances as their own, our groups as their own, and our successes and failures as their own. Before our performance at the Bolshoi Theatre, the Soviet government's Ministry of Culture and some great artists gave us specific assistance with each of our programs, which moved us even more.
    Nikolai Karpov, who once played Lenin, was ordered to send us from Kiev to Kharkov. This great artist, who has more than 30 years of stage experience and enjoys a great reputation, can be said to take care of our young comrades getting on and off the bus, staying in hotels, and eating, just like an old father, until we left Kharkov. No one has ever seen him put on the airs of a great artist. This kind of humility and ordinariness can be seen in many great Soviet artists.
    Those lovely Soviet soldiers often helped us move props and clean the stage, and they thanked us before leaving; those who had only seen us on the street or only welcomed us at the station, or those who had only seen and heard us on the radio and television, sent us letters and telegrams from the Black Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the Far East to congratulate us. Until we reached Otbor, the last stop in the Soviet Union, we continued to receive these letters and telegrams.
    This is truly only a universal and deeply ingrained brotherly affection that can have such a fervent expression.
    During our stay in Moscow, we thank the Moscow Radio and Television Center. Thanks to their efforts, our performances became the center of discussion in various factories, schools, and barracks. One school even turned an hour of class into a discussion of our program.
    This is not just an artistic performance by the Chinese People's Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe. It demonstrates the deep love and friendship between the peoples of the two countries, as well as the deep love and friendship for the Chinese army built with the Soviet army as a model; it also demonstrates the deep love and friendship for the art in the ranks of the Chinese People's Liberation Army born under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.
    Of course, we not only saw this brotherly love and friendship of the great Soviet people for us, but more importantly, we saw the greatness of the great Soviet people. The reason why the words "great Soviet people" must be added is because of the great internationalist spirit of the great Soviet people. This great internationalist spirit was manifested in helping us in the war and helping those brother countries in Europe. We have been to Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Romania. The people of those countries all praised the great achievements of the Soviet soldiers. It is by no means accidental that groups of people go to the Soviet monuments to lay flowers. After the war, the Soviet Union helped us and our brother countries to carry out restoration and construction; just like in our country, Soviet-made machines, Soviet experts and technicians can be seen everywhere.
    For this reason, the members of our song and dance troupe often said: "The Soviet people's lives could have been better than they are now, but they still tighten their belts and help others. This is really touching."
    We all thought that this is the highest communist consciousness.
    We are deeply honored to have the great Soviet people as our elder brother, and we are even more proud to have this elder brother as our reliance. We feel that the time in the Soviet Union was too short, just like the Soviet people felt, and we will never forget those days.
    I would like to take this opportunity, in the capital of our great motherland – Beijing, to express our deepest gratitude on behalf of all comrades of our song and dance troupe to the great Soviet people, and hope that one day we will see those unforgettable places and unforgettable people again.

    向伟大的苏联人民致谢
    陈沂
    中国人民解放军歌舞团离开伟大的苏联国土，现在已经一个多月了。这一个多月来，我们无时无刻不在回想我们在苏联那些难忘的日子，我们想我们曾经去过的地方，曾经会见过的人，特别是见到的那些人所给予我们的真挚的难忘的友情。
    世界上再没有伟大的苏联人民对于我们中国人民、中国人民解放军那样亲爱的了。我们在苏联国境上所遇到的苏军边防哨兵，虽然没有讲一句话，但是那种笑——看着头上戴有“八一”五星帽徽的中国战友时那种完全出于内心的笑，以及当我们的火车驶过他们的面前，他们持枪向我们敬礼，那斜视着的眼睛，那微动着的嘴唇向我们所发出的会心的笑，这不是比亲兄弟还亲的表现吗？我们的同志都不禁发出喊声：“红军”，“红军”。
    “红军”，这是我们从历史上就对伟大苏联人民的英雄子弟最尊敬和最亲爱的称呼。然而这还不过是我们第一次接触伟大的苏联人民和他的英雄子弟。
    以后从远东的奥德堡到莫斯科，又从西部著名的布列斯特到莫斯科，虽然先前是在夏天，后来是在冬天，但伟大的苏联人民和他们的英雄子弟并没有因为气候的变化而对我们有什么差别，越是冷越显得温暖。即使在零下四十度的严寒下——一般人在这时候是连呼吸都有点感到急促的——他们还照样有节奏地吹奏着“莫斯科—北京”或中苏两国国歌。尤其可感的是像喀山、萨拉托夫这些城市，我们只是路过一下，火车还停不到十分钟，当地的劳动人民和苏军战士也在大雪纷飞中等候我们，还穿着民族服装在车站上和我们跳舞。其唯一的希望就是看看伟大的六亿人民的代表（他们是这样称呼我们的），看看他们最亲爱的中国兄弟。在斯维尔德洛夫斯克，基洛夫冶金工业学院院长的代表，代表着两万多学生向我们说：“你们可以拒绝为我们演出，但不能拒绝作我们的客人，更不能拒绝接受我们的礼物。”全校师生为我们准备了一个美丽而珍贵的乌拉尔宝石作成的盒子，我们是没有理由拒绝的，我们愿意我们两国的友谊像乌拉尔的宝石一样永远放射光芒。
    莫斯科大学，斯大林汽车工厂，我们都去参观过了。工人们、学生们是那样热烈地欢迎我们，他们都以没有看到我们的演出为最大的遗憾。海参威、塞瓦斯托波尔、敖德萨，还有其他许多地方，都打电报要我们去，他们是从无线电广播中知道我们的。那些我们曾经去访问过的城市，像布列斯特、像明斯克、像基辅、像哈尔科夫、像列宁格勒、像莫斯科、像斯大林格勒以及斯维尔德洛夫斯克、新西伯利亚、伊尔库茨克、赤塔，没有一个人不是说我们去的时间太短了。基辅市苏维埃主席说：“你们最少应该在这里留两个月。”列宁格勒的人们把我们的汽车包围着不让我们走，在剧场里一直谢幕十次还是下不了台，最后演员和观众在一起拥抱，跳舞。而所有这些地方都卖了站票。
    在莫斯科我们更荣幸地能够到国立莫斯科大剧院演出，我们认为这是苏联政府和人民给予我们最崇高的荣誉，我们每一个团员都深知这次演出的重大意义而感到这是毕生难忘的事。
    基辅城郊四十公里第米尔区斯大林集体农庄主席伊凡·亚克夫，一个夏伯阳部队的游击队员，代表全区人民来邀请我们去访问，他们并且还特地为我们扫清了被大雪覆盖了的公路。这是多么感动人的事呀！
    在哈尔科夫，同一个时间，袜子工厂、自行车工厂、镰刀和锤子工厂请我们去访问，并送了礼物给我们。
    曾经在第二次世界大战中首先抗击侵入的德寇的布列斯特城堡驻军、列宁格勒的纳希莫夫海军学校、基辅的苏沃洛夫军官学校，以及曾经保卫过莫斯科并从莫斯科打到布拉格的近卫坦克部队都曾邀请我们去访问，他们都把他们的英雄历史和成就很详尽地介绍给我们，学生们还为我们作了表演。
    在明斯克，光荣的苏军部队和他的领导人邀请我们参加炮兵节，并为他们举行庆祝表演，我们优秀演员们都被邀请上主席台。我们所唱的中国人民解放军进行曲和苏军之歌在演唱进行中就为掌声湮没，这充分说明了中苏两国军队的兄弟般的深厚友谊。
    我们还参观了好些个曾经为我们或正在为我们生产机器支援我国社会主义建设的工厂，工人们都在车间贴有标语：“为提前完成中国定货的生产任务而奋斗”。
    我们所到之处，都被人群簇拥着，被拉着，抱着，有时甚至被高举着。最令人难忘的是在英雄城市斯大林格勒、列宁格勒、莫斯科，天气都是冰冻和雾气沉沉的，但总是很多人在车站上欢迎我们。我们的火车和旅馆门前总是人群不断。我们去参观冬宫，参观巴夫洛夫作战地，参观地下铁道，都有人跟着我们，还有人自动为我们解释。他们不管我们听得懂听不懂，总是一个劲地比划着说。
    那些大艺术家，包括国立莫斯科大剧院总导演、五次斯大林奖金获得者巴拉托夫，苏联人民演员、四次斯大林奖金获得者果果列娃以及作曲家查哈罗夫、莫拉杰里、亚历山大洛夫、全苏人民演员但克维奇、巴多任斯基、卡也达夫、郭美里亚、拉赫林，以及好多功勋演员，功勋艺术团体为我们表演，为我们训练，为我们的节目加工，他们完全把我们的演出当成是他们自己的事，把我们的团体当成他们自己的团体，把我们的成功和失败都当成他们自己的成功和失败。我们在大剧院演出前，苏联政府文化部和一些大艺术家们给我们每一个节目作了具体的帮助，这更使我们感动。
    曾经扮演过列宁的尼古拉·卡波也夫奉命从基辅送我们到哈尔科夫，这个曾经有三十多年的舞台生活经验而且享有盛誉的大艺术家，他可以说完全像一个老爸爸一样照顾我们年轻的同志们上车下车，住旅馆，吃饭，一直到我们离开哈尔科夫为止。谁也没有看见过他摆过什么大艺术家的架子，这种谦虚，平凡，在苏联许多大艺术家的身上都是可以见到的。
    那些可爱的苏军战士们，经常帮助我们搬道具，清理舞台，临走还要谢谢我们；那些只是在街头见过我们的人或只是在车站上欢迎过我们的人，或者只是从无线电广播和电视里见到和听到我们的人，都从黑海，波罗的海，远东给我们来信，来电报向我们祝贺。一直到我们到达苏境最后一站奥德堡时，我们还不断收到这些信件和电报。
    这真是只有普遍深入内心的兄弟之情才能有如此狂热的表现。
    我们在逗留莫斯科期间，感谢莫斯科广播电台和电视中心，由于他们的努力，我们的演出成了各个工厂，学校，兵营谈论的中心，有一个学校一小时的上课竟变成讨论我们的节目了。
    这岂只是中国人民解放军歌舞团的一个艺术演出问题，这表现了两国人民团结的深厚友爱，也表现了对以苏军为榜样建设起来中国军队的深厚友爱；也表现了对在中国共产党领导下诞生的中国人民解放军队伍中的艺术的深厚友爱。
    我们当然还不仅是看到伟大的苏联人民对我们这种兄弟般的深厚友爱，更重要的是看到伟大苏联人民的所以伟大，其所以必须冠以伟大苏联人民的字样是由于伟大苏联人民的伟大国际主义精神，这种伟大的国际主义精神表现在战争中援助过我们，援助过欧洲那些兄弟国家。我们曾经到过波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、罗马尼亚，那些国家的人民都是赞口不绝地传诵着苏军战士的伟大功绩。那些一群群的人到苏军纪念碑前献花决不是偶然的。战争结束后苏联又帮助我们和兄弟国家进行恢复和建设；正像在我们国家一样，到处都可以看到苏联生产的机器、苏联的专家和技术人员。
    为此，我们歌舞团的团员们经常说：“苏联人民的生活本可以过得比现在好，但他们还是节衣缩食，援助别人，这真是很可感动的。”
    我们都以为这就是最高的共产主义的觉悟。
    我们深以有伟大苏联人民这个老大哥为无尚光荣，更深以有这个老大哥为我们的依靠而感到非常骄傲，我们同苏联人民一样感到在苏联的时间是太短了，我们是念念不忘于那些日子的。
    我愿在这里，我们伟大祖国的首都——北京，代表我们歌舞团全体同志对伟大的苏联人民深深的致谢，希望我们有一天再看见那些难以忘怀的地方，难以忘怀的人们。
