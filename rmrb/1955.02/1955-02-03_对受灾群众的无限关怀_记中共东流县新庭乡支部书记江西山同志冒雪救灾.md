Infinite Care for Disaster-Stricken Masses
    ——A Record of Jiang Xishan, Secretary of the Xin Ting Township Branch of the CPC in Dongliu County, Rescuing Disaster Victims in the Snow
    Huang Gengting

    December 28, 1954. It was snowing heavily in the disaster area of Dongliu County, Anhui Province.

    That night, Jiang Xishan, the Party branch secretary of Xin Ting Township, tossed and turned in bed, unable to sleep. He thought, "The water in the Yanghu and Sanduan electoral districts is receding slowly, and some of the disaster victims who have returned have not yet settled down. In this snowy weather, I wonder how they are doing?" Jiang Xishan had not fully recovered from a long illness. Although the district committee had decided not to let him participate in this intense winter disaster relief work, he couldn't stay in bed any longer. As soon as it was dawn, he braved the snow and headed towards those two electoral districts. First, he arrived in the Yanghu electoral district and asked the electoral district representative, Zhu Yuanxi, "It's snowing so heavily. Are the disaster victims' shacks leaking? Have you mobilized the disaster victims who haven't built their shacks to relocate?" Zhu Yuanxi replied:
    "Don't worry, we don't have any major problems here. I already held a meeting to mobilize them to relocate."
    "After holding the meeting, did you check each household?" Jiang Xishan frowned and interrupted before he could finish speaking. From his past work, he knew that Zhu Yuanxi's work was not very solid; sometimes he talked a good game but didn't deliver.
    "I did check, but whether they have already relocated, I'm not very… very sure." Zhu Yuanxi's face showed embarrassment, and he answered hesitantly. Then, he sighed, "I told them to move, but they won't. What can I do!"
    Jiang Xishan looked at Zhu Yuanxi's face and said, "It's so cold. If they had a way, who would be foolish enough not to move?" He turned and stepped out the door, saying, "Take me to see the homes of the disaster victims."

    Jiang Xishan checked about thirty disaster victim households, and found that five households had not yet built their shacks, and two households had built shacks, but they were leaking snow badly. In the home of poor peasant Chen Yesheng, five family members, old and young, were huddled together, their heads covered, sleeping here, with snowflakes all over their quilts. Jiang Xishan bent down and gently lifted the quilt, saying, "Chen Yesheng, how can you stand living here in this cold weather?"

    Zhu Yuanxi, who was watching beside him, immediately turned red in the face. He complained:
    "I held a meeting to mobilize them, but he wouldn't move. I can't drag him, can I!"

    Chen Yesheng said with a weeping face, "Where can we move five family members, old and young, to?"
    "Doesn't your eldest son have a house? Why don't you move there?" Zhu Yuanxi asked.
    "The eldest son does have a house, but I don't get along very well with him. How can I move there?" It turned out that Chen Yesheng's brother's house could accommodate five or six people, but because they usually had some quarrels, he didn't want to move there.

    "Don't worry, move there, I'll take responsibility!" Jiang Xishan comforted him. After saying that, he went to Chen Yesheng's brother's house with Zhu Yuanxi, persuaded his brother, and immediately helped Chen Yesheng move over.

    Checking further, Jiang Xishan saw a large shack locked. After inquiring, he found out that the people had gone to the embankment, and the house only contained some firewood. He said to Zhu Yuanxi, "Saving people is like putting out a fire. Quickly open the door, put the firewood aside temporarily, and let the disaster victims who can't live in their shacks move in." So they helped two disaster victim households from the shacks next to this house move in. Jiang Xishan also found ways to relocate another four disaster victim households.

    Checking at Zhang Guangyao's house, he saw a water buffalo shivering under the eaves. Jiang Xishan quickly found Zhang Guangyao and complained, "If you don't take care of the cow like this, and it freezes to death, what will you use to plow the fields in the spring?" Zhang Guangyao said, "There's nowhere to tie it up, what can I do!" Jiang Xishan went into the house and examined it for a while, estimating that it could be tied up. He said, "Right now, the snow is blocking the door. Are you still trying to be spacious? Can't you tie it up in the house and squeeze in?" After Jiang Xishan said this, Zhang Guangyao led the cow into the house and spread a layer of grass on the ground.

    That day, Jiang Xishan was busy until the afternoon tea break before returning to the township government. At the township government, he discussed the disaster situation with the district committee work team, divided the work, took the 950,000 yuan of relief funds temporarily issued by the government, returned home, hurriedly ate dinner, grabbed a bed sheet, draped it over himself, and prepared to leave again. His wife, Han Jinxi, looked at him, then looked at the皑皑 white snow outside the door, and asked with concern, "Dad of Cuiying, it's so cold. Are you still going out? How can you bear it?"

    Jiang Xishan replied, "Right now, the snow is blocking the door, and the disaster victims are in great difficulty. If we don't help them solve their problems, there will be trouble." He also said, "I'm going to the Yanghu and Sanduan electoral districts tonight, and I may not come home to rest."

    "Yanghu and Sanduan are three or four li away from here. The road is narrow, and there are many snow pits. Even a strong person may not be able to find their way. How can you do it with your weak body!" Han Jinxi said worriedly, seeing that the snow was falling harder and the wind was blowing stronger. It turned out that Jiang Xishan's body was very weak. Recently, he had been sick, and he was still coughing loudly from time to time when he spoke. Previously, Jiang Xishan's body was very good. Last year, during flood prevention, he insisted on staying on the river embankment all day. When the dike broke, he risked his life to save people, often without changing his wet clothes. Later, he led people to open up wasteland on the mountain. He was tired under the scorching sun during the day and rested in the dew at night. He caught a cold, fell ill, and refused to leave until he was so sick that he couldn't hold on anymore, and then he was sent home by someone. Jiang Xishan lay in bed for more than two months, and before he was fully recovered, he struggled to go to work. Now, he's overworked and still has chills and fever from time to time.

    "Don't worry," Jiang Xishan comforted Han Jinxi, "I'm going with Zhang Shaofu. If I can't walk, he'll support me."

    Jiang Xishan called Zhang Shaofu (Party branch education committee member) along the way, and went straight to the Yanghu electoral district. At this time, the north wind howled like a hungry wolf, and the snowflakes hit people so hard that they couldn't open their eyes. They took one step and sank one step. In the low-lying areas, they sank more than half a foot, and their shoes and socks were soaked. After walking only a little over a li out of the village, Jiang Xishan fell into a snow pit and sank up to his thighs. Zhang Shaofu used a lot of strength to pull him up. He patted off the snow and staggered forward again. The further they went, the lower the terrain, the narrower and more slippery the road became. When they reached the riverbank in the Yanghu electoral district, he had already fallen three times. He was about to sit in a waist basin to cross the river when he found that Tang Yanchang, who lived at the ferry, was asleep. Jiang Xishan knocked on Tang Yanchang's door, "Get up quickly, take us across the river." Tang Yanchang muttered in the house, "Who is it? Crossing the river in this snowy weather? I'm asleep, I can't get up!" Jiang Xishan said:
    "It's me – Jiang Xishan, there's something urgent, I have to cross the river immediately." Only then did Tang Yanchang open the door and walk out, jump into the waist basin, pick up the pole, push it, and shake his head: "The waist basin is frozen, I can't open it." Jiang Xishan thought:
    "Such an important matter, we can't delay even for a moment!" So he and Zhang Shaofu immediately jumped into the waist basin and said to Tang Yanchang, "You break the ice in front, and we'll squat in the back and rock." Finally, they crossed to the other side. The place where they landed was so slippery that they couldn't stand still, so they had to put their hands on the ground and climb up with difficulty. The road on the dike was only four or five inches wide and was frozen. If they lost their footing, they would slide down the very steep icy bank into the ditch. Zhang Shaofu supported Jiang Xishan and walked carefully. When they reached a place where they really couldn't stand still, they had to put their hands on the ground again and slowly crawl. Finally, they reached the Yanghu electoral district. They checked every disaster victim's home again, and only after seeing that everyone was settled did they feel relieved.

    Jiang Xishan and Zhang Shaofu went to Zhang Guangyao's house, convened a meeting of electoral district representatives, and discussed which disaster victims were in the most difficulty and needed immediate relief, and which disaster victims could wait a little longer for relief. The meeting lasted until late at night before it ended. At this time, Jiang Xishan still wanted to cross another river ditch to the Sanduan electoral district. He walked to the river, found that the waist basin was on the other side, and called for a while, but no one let it over, so he had to return to Zhang Guangyao's house. Zhang Guangyao and his wife wanted to give their quilts to Jiang Xishan to sleep in, but he firmly refused. So he and Zhang Shaofu re-examined the relief households that had been determined at the meeting earlier. They sat until the first crow of the rooster. Everyone was so sleepy that they couldn't bear it, and their bodies were shivering from the cold, so they had to doze off on the table.

    The next morning, Jiang Xishan woke Zhang Shaofu, intending to cross the river to the Sanduan electoral district again. Zhang Shaofu saw that his face was pale, his lips were purple, and his teeth were chattering when he spoke, and he firmly refused to let him go. Jiang Xishan stayed in the Yanghu electoral district to convene a meeting of the most difficult disaster victims and personally distributed the relief funds to the disaster victims. At breakfast time, Zhang Shaofu supported Jiang Xishan and braved the snow to return home. Jiang Xishan fell on the bed, feeling cold and feverish, and groaning in pain. However, on the third day, when he felt a little better, he went out to work again.

    Jiang Xishan's selfless work spirit and selfless work attitude have been consistent. Before this snowfall, the government had issued a large amount of living relief funds. Jiang Xishan's family had a total of seven members, the oldest child was only thirteen years old, and life was very hard. Based on his family's situation, the neighbors assessed him with 140,000 yuan of living relief funds and had already posted the list.

    One evening, Jiang Xishan went to visit the home of disaster victim Zhang Fuyu and saw that Zhang Fuyu and his old partner were both frowning. Jiang Xishan knew that they had something on their minds, so he asked him what difficulties they had. Zhang Fuyu frowned tightly and just sighed. When Jiang Xishan saw this scene, he already understood a thing or two in his heart. He walked close to the stove, lifted the pot lid, and asked, "Are you unable to make ends meet again?" Zhang Fuyu said annoyedly, "At first, I thought that the government would help us rebuild our homes with cash, so I didn't ask for living relief funds. Who knew that the government is issuing things now. As a result, we have no means of livelihood. For the past two days, I've been borrowing ten thousand yuan from people to feed ourselves, but I won't be able to get by in the future. I applied to the government for a 150,000 living loan, but it hasn't been issued yet, and I'm really worried!"

    Zhang Fuyu was over fifty years old, and his whole family of seven depended on him alone to support them. Jiang Xishan pondered silently: "What to do? The living relief funds have already been assessed, and the list has already been posted, how can we reassess them?" After thinking for a while, he felt that there was no other way except to switch his own relief funds with Zhang Fuyu's loan. So he said to Zhang Fuyu, "Come to the township with me. I'll find a way to solve your difficulties."

    When they arrived at the township government, Jiang Xishan found the clerk, Lu Dawang, and asked him to change his own relief fund distribution form to give Zhang Fuyu 120,000 yuan in person, and give the other 20,000 yuan to the poor peasant, Wei Xianzhou. Zhang Fuyu was very moved and refused to accept it. He said, "Yours are relief funds, mine is a loan. If you switch it to me, won't you be at a great disadvantage? Besides, your family's situation is similar to mine. If you give it to me, what will you do yourself?" Jiang Xishan said, "I am a cadre detached from production, and I still have a monthly allowance of 150,000 yuan. My wife can also go to quarry stones and carry yellow sand. Although the family's living difficulties cannot be completely solved, it's still better than you. Take this money to feed yourself first." Zhang Fuyu had no choice but to accept it.

    Comrade Jiang Xishan demonstrated the excellent qualities of a Communist Party member in disaster relief, and set a good example for all the cadres in the township. As Zhang Shaofu, the education committee member of the Xin Ting Township Party branch, said, "Old Jiang has two characteristics: first, he can persevere, and he keeps working even when he's sick; second, he's selfless and impartial, and he does what should be done."

    Currently, Jiang Xishan's family is living in great difficulty, and the district committee is helping him to solve it. At the same time, the district committee, considering that his body is very weak, has decided to issue him a personal cotton overcoat and transfer him to the district to recuperate.

    对受灾群众的无限关怀
    ——记中共东流县新庭乡支部书记江西山同志冒雪救灾
    黄根亭
    一九五四年十二月二十八日。安徽省东流县的灾区里，在降着大雪。
    这天夜里，新庭乡党支部书记江西山同志，在床上翻来覆去睡不着。他想：“扬湖、三段两个选区的水退得迟，有些灾民回来还没安好家，这大雪天，不知道他们怎么过的？”江西山久病以后，还没有痊愈。虽然区委已决定不让他参加这次紧张的冬季救灾工作，但他无论如何也躺不下去了。天刚曚曚亮，他就冒着雪，朝那两个选区走去。先到了那扬湖选区里，他就问选区代表朱远西：“雪下得这样大，你们这里灾民的草棚漏不漏雪？没搭好草棚的灾民可曾动员他们迁移了？”朱远西答道：
  “你放心，我们这里没大问题，我早已开会动员他们迁移了。”
      “开会动员后，你可曾挨户检查过？”江西山皱起眉头，没等他说完又插上问。从以往的工作中，他知道朱远西工作不很踏实，有时讲得好听，做得不行。
    “检查是检查过，他们是不是已经迁移了，还拿……拿不大稳。”朱远西脸上露出尴尬神色，吞吞吐吐地回答着。接着，他又叹口长气：“叫他们搬，他们不搬，有什么办法！”
      江西山看着朱远西的脸说：“天气这样寒冷，他们要是有办法，谁还发傻不搬走？”他转过身跨出门说：“你带我到灾民家瞧瞧。”
    江西山挨户检查了三十来家灾民，发现有五户草棚还没搭好，有两户草棚虽是搭成了，但漏雪很厉害。贫农陈叶胜家，老小五口子蒙住头睡在这里，被子上落满了雪花。江西山弯下身子轻轻地揭开被说：“陈叶胜，这大冷天住这里，怎吃得消？”
    在旁边看着的朱远西顿时红了脸，他埋怨道：
  “我开会动员过，他不肯搬，我也不能拖他呀！”
    陈叶胜哭丧着脸说：“老小五口子，搬那去？”
      “你老大不是有房子吗？为什么不搬去？”朱远西问。
    “老大是有房子，可是我同他过得不大对劲，怎么搬去？”原来陈叶胜的哥哥家，能容纳得下五、六口子，因为平时互相间有点口舌，他不愿意搬去。
    “你放心搬去，有我负责！”江西山安慰他说。说完就和朱远西到陈叶胜他哥哥家去，把他哥哥说通了，马上帮陈叶胜搬了过去。
    再往前检查，江西山看见有一间大草棚，锁着门，一打听，原来这户的人上堤去了，屋里只堆着一些柴草。他向朱远西说：“救人如救火，快打开门，把柴草暂时甩在一边，让草棚里不能住的灾民搬进去。”于是他们就帮助这间屋子旁边草棚里的两户灾民安置进去。另有四户灾民，江西山也设法把他们迁移了。
    检查到张光耀家，看见屋檐底下有条水牛，冻得直颤抖，江西山连忙找张光耀，埋怨道：“这样不顾牛，冻死了，你开春拿什么耕地？”张光耀说：“没处拴，有什么办法！”江西山进屋里端详一会，估摸着能拴得下，就说：“目前是大雪封门，你还图宽畅？就不能拴到屋里挤挤吗？”经江西山一说，张光耀就把牛牵到屋里，还在地上铺了一层草。
    这天，江西山直忙到下午茶点时分，才回到乡政府。在乡政府又和区委工作组研究了灾情，分好工，带了政府临时发下的九十五万元救济款，回到家里，匆匆忙忙吃了晚饭，随手拿过一条被单，往身上一披，又准备走了。他老婆韩金喜朝他看看，又望望门外皑皑的白雪，关心地问：“翠英她爸爸，天气这样冷，你还要出去？怎么受得住？”
    江西山回答道：“眼下大雪封门，灾民困难很大，不帮助解决，会出岔子。”又说：“我今晚到扬湖、三段选区去，不一定来家歇了。”
    “扬湖和三段离这儿有三、四里路，路又窄，雪坑又多，身体硬实的人也不一定能摸到，你身体这样弱怎么行呢！”韩金喜看着雪越下越大，风越刮越紧，担心地说。原来江西山的身体很不好，很瘦弱，最近还生着病，讲话时还不时地大声咳嗽着。以前，江西山的身体很好，去年防汛的时候，成天坚持在江堤上。破圩时，冒着生命危险救人，常常衣服湿了也不换。后来，他又带人上山开荒，白天在滚烫的太阳底下累，夜里在露水里歇，受了凉，病了还不肯离开，直到病得实在架不住了，才由人送回家。江西山在床上足足躺了两个多月，没有完全好，又撑着去工作了。现在累狠了，还不时发寒发热。
      “你不用担心”，江西山安慰着韩金喜：“我和章绍福一块去，走不动了他会扶着我的。”
    江西山顺路叫了章绍福（党支部教育委员），就迳直朝扬湖选区走去了。这时，北风像饿狼似地怒吼着，雪花打得人睁不开眼，走一步，陷一步，低洼的地方直陷下半尺多，鞋袜都湿透了。走出庄子才里把路，江西山就一下跌进雪坑，直陷到大胯，章绍福用好大的劲才把他拖上来。他拍拍雪花，又摇摇晃晃地朝前走去。越往前走，地势越低，路越窄、越滑，走到扬湖选区河边，他已跌了三跤。正要坐腰盆过河。这时发现住在渡口的唐炎昌已睡着了。江西山敲着唐炎昌的门：“快起来，渡我们过河去。”唐炎昌在屋内咕噜：“那个？这大雪天还过河？我睡了，起不来啦！”江西山说：
  “是我——江西山，有紧要事，得马上过河去。”唐炎昌这才开门走出，跳进腰盆，拿起篙子一推，摇摇头：“腰盆冻住了，开不过去了。”江西山想：
  “这样要紧的事，一刻也不能耽误呀！”于是他和章绍福立即跳进腰盆，对唐炎昌说：“你在前头打冰，我俩蹲在后头摇晃。”终于渡到对岸。上岸的地方滑得站不住脚，两人只好用两手扑地，吃力地爬上去。圩顶上的路只有四、五寸宽，又结了冰，只要一失足，就会顺着很陡的冰岸滑到河沟里。章绍福扶着江西山，小心翼翼地走着；走到实在站不住脚的地方，只得再用两手扑地慢慢地爬。终于，他们走到了扬湖选区。他俩挨户又到灾民家检查一遍，见都安顿好了，才放了心。
    江西山和章绍福到张光耀家里，召集选区代表开会，研究那些灾民最困难，需要立时救济；那些灾民还可以缓一缓救济。会议开到深夜才结束。这时，江西山还想渡另一条河沟到三段选区去，他走到河边，发现腰盆在对岸，叫了一会，没人放过来，只得折回到张光耀家来。张光耀夫妇要把自己的被子让出来叫江西山睡，他坚决不要，便又和章绍福把刚才会议上确定的救济户，重新研究了一次。他们一直坐到头遍鸡叫，人都困得不行，浑身冷得打颤，只好伏在桌子上打盹。
    第二天清早，江西山叫醒章绍福，打算再过河到三段选区去。章绍福见他脸色苍白，嘴唇发紫，讲话时牙齿“咯咯”的响，坚决不让他去。江西山就留在扬湖选区召集最困难的灾民开会，把救济款亲自发到灾民手里。早饭时分，章绍福扶着江西山冒雪回到家里。江西山倒在床上，发冷发烧，难过得直哼。可是，在第三天稍微有点精神时，他又出去工作了。
    江西山这种忘我的工作精神和大公无私的工作态度是一贯的。在这次下雪以前，政府曾发放了大批生活救济款。江西山家老小共有七口，孩子最大的才十三岁，生活很苦，左邻右舍根据他家情况，评给他十四万元生活救济款，并已经出榜公布。
    有天傍晚，江西山到灾民张富余家串门子，看到张富余和他老伴都愁眉苦脸，江西山知道他们有心事，就问他有什么困难，张富余紧皱着眉头，只是叹气，江西山看到这番光景，心里已明白一二，走近锅台揭开锅盖一看，就又问道：“是不是又餬不下去了？”张富余烦恼的说：“开头，我料想政府帮我们重建家园的准是现款，因此，没要生活救济款，那知现在政府发的是东西。这一来，生活就没着落了。这两天向人家借万把元餬嘴，以后没法过。向政府申请贷十五万生活贷款，还没发下来，正愁着呢！”
    张富余已五十多岁，全家七口靠他一人养活。江西山暗暗思忖：“怎办？生活救济款已经评完，榜也公布过了，那能重评？”他寻思一会，觉得除了把自己的救济款和张富余的贷款对调外，再没有其他办法，就对张富余说：“你跟我到乡里去一趟，有困难想办法解决。”
    到了乡政府里，江西山找到文书陆大旺，叫他当面把自己的救济款发放单改给张富余十二万，还有两万让给贫农魏贤周。张富余很感动，不肯接受，他说：“你的是救济款，我的是贷款，你调给我，不是吃了大亏吗？再说，你家里情况和我差不多，让给了我，你自己怎办？”江西山说：“我是脱离生产的干部，每月还有十五万元的津贴，我老婆还可以去打石子，挑黄沙，家里的生活困难虽不能完全解决，但总还比你强些。这钱你先拿去餬口吧。”张富余只好收下了。
    江西山同志在救灾中，表现了共产党员的优良品质，为全乡干部树立了良好的榜样。正如新庭乡党支部教育委员章绍福所说的：“老江有两个特点：一是能坚持，身体有毛病还一个劲工作；二是大公无私，该怎样就怎样。”
    目前，江西山的家庭生活很困难，区委正在帮助他进行解决。同时，区委考虑到他的身体很衰弱，决定发给他个人棉大衣一件，并调他到区里去休养。
