    Such Review and Rectification Cannot Be Carried Out
    Zhong Xia
    Recently, the vast majority of newly established agricultural producers' cooperatives are carrying out rectification and consolidation work. Some cooperatives, after rectification, have purged landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries who had infiltrated the cooperatives, ensuring the purity of the cooperatives and leading them towards organizational consolidation. However, certain deviations and errors have emerged in the rectification and review work of some cooperatives. Some cooperatives have purged people who should not have been expelled, and some have even used various excuses to exclude poor peasants from the cooperatives.
    There are such examples: In the Xiwang Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Xiangyang County, Hubei Province, there are a total of one hundred and forty-one households; during the rectification process, thirty-three households were reviewed and expelled. Among these households, sixteen were so-called "of impure origin," nine were "bad-tempered," and eight were "loafers." In Xingping County, Shaanxi Province, among the sixty-three peasant households expelled from the first district, fifty-six were poor peasants.
    Some cooperatives, unable to find any political reason to expel poor peasants, resorted to increasing the amount of production collateral to be paid, thereby squeezing the poor peasants out. The Haozhuang Agricultural Producers' Cooperative in Nanpi County, Hebei Province, required poor and rich peasants to share various investment funds equally and to pay them immediately. The poor peasant Hao Shuyin could only offer ten jin of wheat seeds but could not afford the livestock payment. The cooperative director said, "If you can't pay, go cool off outside the cooperative for two years and then come back." This poor peasant household was thus squeezed out of the cooperative.
    Agricultural producers' cooperatives are economic organizations voluntarily formed by the working people themselves. Apart from landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionaries who are not allowed to join, male and female laboring peasants and other laborers in the countryside can voluntarily join. It is wrong to casually expel peasants from the cooperative on the grounds of being "bad-tempered" or "loafers"; it is even more wrong to use various methods to exclude poor peasants from the cooperative.
    Agricultural producers' cooperatives in various places that are currently carrying out rectification work should check whether their work in this regard is in line with the spirit of the policy. Those who must be purged from the cooperative should indeed be purged, and those who should not be purged should not be purged.

    不能这样进行审查整顿
    仲夏
    最近，绝大部分新建的农业生产合作社都在进行整顿巩固工作。有些社经过了整顿，清洗了混入社内的地主、富农和反革命分子，保证了社的纯洁，使新社从组织上走向巩固。但是，有些社在整顿审查工作中，却出现了某些偏差和错误。有些社把不应该出社的人清洗出去了，有些社竟以各种借口排挤贫农出社。
    有这样一些事例：湖北省襄阳县西湾农业生产合作社，共一百四十一户；在整顿过程中，被审查出社的有三十三户。这些户中有所谓“出身不纯”的十六户，“脾气不好”的九户，“二流子”八户。陕西兴平县一区被审查出社的六十三户农民中，竟有五十六户是贫农。
    有些合作社找不出任何让贫农出社的政治上的理由，就用提高应摊生产底垫的办法，把贫农排挤出去。河北省南皮县郝庄农业生产合作社，要求贫富平均分摊各种投资款项，而且要马上交齐。贫农郝书印只能拿出十斤麦种，但拿不起牲口款。社长就说：“你拿不出钱来，先在社外凉快二年再来吧。”这户贫农就这样被挤出了社。
    农业生产合作社本是劳动人民自己联合的经济组织，除掉地主、富农和反革命分子不能入社以外，农村中的男女劳动农民和其他劳动者都可自愿入社。以“脾气不好”“二流子”为借口，随便清洗农民出社，是很不对的；以各种办法排挤贫农出社，更是错误的。
    各地正在进行整顿工作的农业生产合作社，应该检查一下自己这方面的工作是否符合政策精神。要把必须清洗出社的分子确实清洗出社，不应清洗出社的不要清洗出社。
