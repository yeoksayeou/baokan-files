	Greening the Gobi Desert
	"If you want to live in the Gobi Desert, trees are our reliance. With trees, there is life; without trees, there is no life." The elders of Ayikumu in Pishan County, southern Xinjiang, have been telling their children this for generations.
	For many years, the people of Ayikumu have followed the instructions of their ancestors, planting trees before planting crops. For their survival and development, they carried water in gourds, watering the trees one by one. However, during the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, the reactionaries often forced them to cut down the trees they had planted with their own hands to use as fuel. The farmers reluctantly cut down one tree, but then quickly planted two more, stubbornly resisting those enemies who were even more ferocious than the wind and sand. Now, Ayikumu has become a village surrounded by green trees, with more than 390 households and 6,800 mu of cultivated land.
	When we talked to the farmers of Ayikumu about these situations, Jili Qiaowa (male), the long-term mutual aid team leader, told us: "Now, the cadres of the People's Government are closer than relatives. They often educate us by saying: Planting trees can prevent wind, sand, drought, and floods; planting mulberry trees can also raise silkworms, and the fruit trees can grow fruit to eat when they grow up. The benefits are endless. From 1950 to 1954, the whole of Ayikumu planted more than 30,000 trees." He pointed around with his hand, "You see, when I was young, this was the edge of the Gobi Desert, with only a dozen trees; now the Gobi Desert has moved far away, and there are more trees." Indeed, the edge of the Gobi Desert has retreated about two li to the north, and a small forest has grown in this two-li range.
	This winter, Jili Qiaowa's mutual aid team, with 18 households, will plant 300 trees, and the whole of Ayikumu plans to plant 10,000 trees. In the eyes of the people of Ayikumu, this plan is just a small plan compared to the great future. Jili Qiaowa told us: "We have more than 7,000 mu of wasteland north of Ayikumu. When spring comes, we plan to plant trees and create forests on this wasteland, slowly creating a large forest. After the whole of Ayikumu is collectivized, we will ask the government to help us open a 20-li-long canal from the south to the district, bringing mountain water, spring water, and well water into the canal. We will plant trees on both sides of the canal, turning the desert in the middle into a green forest, and connecting Ayikumu with the district." When Jili Qiaowa depicted this beautiful vision of the future, his face shone with excitement.

### 绿化戈壁

    绿化戈壁
    “要在戈壁上居住生活，树就是我们的依靠，有树就有命，没有树就没有命。”生活在南疆皮山县阿衣库木的老人都这样地叮嘱自己的子孙。
    多少年来，阿衣库木的人民遵照祖先的叮嘱，先栽好树然后再种庄稼。为了自己的生存和发展，他们用葫芦背水，一棵一棵的浇灌。但是在国民党反动统治的年代，反动分子经常强迫他们砍伐自己亲手栽起来的树木送去当燃料。农民们忍心地砍掉一棵以后，就连忙栽上两棵，顽强地对那些比风沙还凶恶的敌人进行反抗。现在，阿衣库木已经变成一个绿树围绕拥有三百九十多户人家和六千八百多亩耕地的乡村了。
    当我们和阿衣库木的农民谈到这些情景时，常年互助组长吉利乔娃（男）曾这样对我们说：“现在，人民政府的干部比亲人还亲，他们经常教育我们说：栽树可以防风沙、防旱灾、防水灾；栽的桑树还可以养蚕，栽的果树长大了可以吃果子，好处真是说不完。从一九五○年到一九五四年，全阿衣库木就栽了三万多株树。”他用手向周围一指，“你们看，我小的时候，这里就是戈壁边上，只有十几棵树；现在戈壁跑远了，树也多了。”的确，戈壁边沿已经向北退去有二里地了，在这二里地范围内已经长成了一片小树林。
    这个冬天，吉利乔娃互助组，十八户人家要栽三百棵树，全阿衣库木计划要栽一万棵树。这个计划，在阿衣库木人的眼里，同远大的未来比起来只不过是一个小小的计划。吉利乔娃告诉我们：“我们阿衣库木北面还有七千多亩荒地，等到春天，我们就有计划地在这片荒地上植树造林，慢慢造成一座大森林。到全阿衣库木合作化以后，再要求政府帮助我们从南面到区上开一条二十里长的大渠，把山水、泉水、井水都引到渠里，渠两旁都栽成树，把中间的沙漠变成绿林，把阿衣库木和区上联结起来。”吉利乔娃描画这幅未来的美景时，脸上闪着兴奋的光彩。白　峰、任崇礼
