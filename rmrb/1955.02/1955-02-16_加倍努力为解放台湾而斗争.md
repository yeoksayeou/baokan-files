    Redouble Our Efforts to Struggle for the Liberation of Taiwan
    The People's Liberation Army troops on the Zhejiang front liberated Dachen Island, Yushan Islands, Pishan Island, and other islands on February 13th. The Chiang bandit troops on these islands have all retreated under the cover of the American armed forces. With the liberation of the above-mentioned islands, the situation along the Zhejiang coast has undergone significant changes. Now, apart from Nanjishan Island in the southernmost part, there are no more enemy-occupied islands along the Zhejiang coast. This is of great significance not only for safeguarding the security of China's Zhejiang coastal area, but also for creating favorable conditions for the liberation of Taiwan and other coastal islands.
    The liberation of Dachen Island, Yushan Islands, Pishan Island, and other islands is another important victory for the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army in their just struggle to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Since last November, the various units of our People's Liberation Army on the Zhejiang front have continuously inflicted heavy blows on the Chiang bandit troops entrenched on Dachen and its surrounding islands. The naval forces of the People's Liberation Army sank the Chiang bandit "Taiping" escort destroyer and the Chiang bandit "Dongting" gunboat; the powerful air force of the People's Liberation Army destroyed the Chiang bandit medium-sized landing craft. Recently, the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces achieved an important victory in liberating Yijiangshan Island, and demonstrated a high level of modern combined operations in this battle. Following closely, our People's Liberation Army continued to bombard the Chiang bandit troops on Dachen Island, greatly softening the enemy's positions. Under the powerful force of our People's Liberation Army, the Chiang bandit troops on Dachen Island, facing the fate of being annihilated, had no choice but to flee in panic from this strategic stronghold, which had once been touted as impregnable, under the cover of the American armed forces.
    The liberation of the Dachen Islands once again vividly illustrates that the just cause of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan and other coastal islands cannot be stopped by any force. The People's Liberation Army has shown that its power is constantly increasing in this struggle. This is a reliable guarantee that the Chinese people will surely accomplish the sacred task of liberating Taiwan. The people of the whole country feel infinitely excited and encouraged by the victory achieved by the heroes of the People's Liberation Army.
    The American armed forces directly participated in the military operations of the Chiang bandit troops on Dachen Island this time. The United States not only dispatched a large number of naval and air forces to Dachen waters to cover and assist the retreat of the Chiang bandit troops, but also fully armed US Marines landed on Dachen to carry out burning, killing, and destruction. American military leaders, including US Seventh Fleet Commander Pride, directly participated in commanding this military operation. This is the most blatant armed interference in China's internal affairs and the most blatant act of aggression. It has aroused indignation and condemnation from international public opinion. A reporter for the "Indian Times" believes that this is "a strange and extraordinary provocation" by the United States against China, and pointed out that US warships are attempting to remain in Chinese waters indefinitely "in the name of withdrawing from Dachen" and assisting the Chiang bandit troops "in defending 'relevant positions and territories.'" In order to cover up their aggressive crimes, the American aggressor group insisted that the US deployment of troops in Dachen waters and assistance to the Chiang bandit troops in their retreat was to establish "peace" in the Taiwan area. But this statement cannot deceive anyone. United Press reporter Hoberecht reported that "this retreat is in preparation for launching a new offensive against the Communist-controlled mainland."
    The American flagrant act of aggression by armed interference in China's internal affairs has clearly further aggravated the tense situation in the Taiwan area. As Foreign Minister Molotov pointed out in his statement when he received British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Hayter on February 4, "This existing situation is endangering the maintenance of peace and increasing the danger of a new war." To ease the tension in this region and eliminate the danger of war, it is necessary first to stop the criminal acts of the United States in interfering in China's internal affairs and aggressing against the People's Republic of China.
    Even more appalling is that when the US Marines helped the Chiang bandit troops withdraw from Dachen and other islands, they systematically and forcibly abducted more than 18,000 Chinese people from these islands. They demolished houses and set them on fire, forcing the people to become homeless, and then, with machine guns threatening those who were unwilling to leave their homes, the US Marines forced them to board US transport ships and abducted them to Taiwan. Many people who refused to leave were massacred by the Chiang bandit troops. United Press International quoted Liu Lianyi, the head of the Chiang bandit troops on Dachen Island, as saying in a bloodthirsty statement: "When we leave, only dead people will be left on the island." This inhuman act of the American invading army, like the US forcibly detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners of war in Korea and instigating the French army to forcibly abduct overseas Chinese in Vietnam, is a serious crime that violates humanity.
    In order to carry out scorched-earth destruction on Dachen and other islands, the United States transferred "experts from the Marine Corps and the Army" from Japan to carry out this heinous work. Due to the burning and blasting by US Navy demolition teams and the Chiang bandit troops, Dachen and other islands have become ruins, and there are no more civilian houses, schools, shops, and buildings on these islands. The United States directed and directly participated in the burning and killing atrocities of the Chiang bandit troops, which made people more clearly recognize that the American invading army is such an army that spreads death and destruction everywhere. All people with conscience and justice will certainly not forgive this bloody crime.
    The heinous crimes committed by the American army and the Chiang bandit troops on Dachen and other islands have further aroused the Chinese people's indignation. We must redouble our efforts to support the military operations of the People's Liberation Army, rapidly strengthen our national defense forces, and resolutely struggle to liberate Taiwan and liberate our compatriots enslaved by the US-Chiang regime.

### 加倍努力为解放台湾而斗争

    加倍努力为解放台湾而斗争
    浙江前线的中国人民解放军部队已于二月十三日解放了大陈岛、渔山列岛、披山岛等岛屿。这些岛屿上的蒋贼军已在美国武装力量的掩护下全部撤逃。由于解放了上述岛屿，浙江沿海的形势已有了很大的变化。现在，除了最南面的南麂山岛之外，浙江沿海已再没有敌占岛屿了。这不但对于保卫我国浙江沿海地区的安全有着重大的意义，并且也为解放台湾和其他沿海岛屿造成了有利的条件。
    解放大陈岛、渔山列岛、披山岛等岛屿，是我国人民和人民解放军在解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团的正义斗争中的又一重要胜利。自去年十一月以来，浙江前线我人民解放军各种部队对盘踞在大陈及其外围岛屿的蒋贼军连续不断地给予了沉重的打击。人民解放军的海军部队击沉了蒋贼“太平号”护航驱逐舰和蒋贼“洞庭号”炮舰；人民解放军的强大机群击毁了蒋贼中字号登陆艇。最近，人民解放军陆、海、空军又取得了解放一江山岛的重要胜利，并在这次战役中表现了高度的联合作战的现代水平。紧跟着，我人民解放军又对大陈岛上的蒋贼军不断进行轰击，大大地软化了敌人的阵地。在我人民解放军的这种强大威力下，在大陈岛上面临覆灭的命运的蒋贼军，遂不得不在美国武装力量的掩护下，从这个曾经被吹嘘为固若金汤的战略据点仓皇撤逃。
    大陈群岛的解放又一次生动地说明了，中国人民解放台湾和其他沿海岛屿的正义事业是任何力量也阻止不了的。中国人民解放军在这个斗争中，显示了它的威力在不断增强。这是中国人民一定能够完成解放台湾的神圣任务的可靠保证。全国人民对于人民解放军英雄们所取得的这个胜利，感到无限的兴奋和鼓舞。
    美国武装力量这次直接参与了大陈岛蒋贼军的军事行动。美国不仅出动了大量的海空军陈兵大陈海面，对蒋贼军的撤逃实行掩护和协助，而且全副武装的美国海军陆战队还曾登陆大陈，进行烧杀破坏。包括美国第七舰队司令普赖德在内的美国军事首脑并直接参与指挥这个军事行动。这是美国对中国内政最露骨的武装干涉和最露骨的侵略行动。它引起了国际舆论的愤慨和指责。“印度时报”的记者就认为这是美国对中国的“一种奇怪的和异乎寻常的挑衅”，并且指出美国的军舰是企图“以撤退大陈的名义”和援助蒋贼军“保卫‘有关阵地和领土’的名义”，打算无限期地留在中国海面。美国侵略集团为了掩饰他们的侵略罪行，硬说美国陈兵大陈海面、帮助蒋贼军撤逃，是为了在台湾地区建立什么“和平”。但是这种说法是骗不了人的。美国合众社记者霍布雷奇特报道说：“这次撤退是准备对共产党控制的大陆发动一次新的进攻。”
    美国公然武装干涉中国内政的侵略行动，显然进一步加剧了台湾地区的紧张局势。正如莫洛托夫外长在二月四日接见英国驻苏大使海特尔时发表的声明中所指出的：“这种现存的局势正在危及和平的维护，正在增加新战争的危险”。要缓和这个地区的紧张局势，消灭战争危险，就必须首先制止美国干涉中国内政和侵略中华人民共和国的罪恶行动。
    更令人发指的是，美国海军陆战队在帮助蒋贼军撤离大陈等岛屿时，有计划的以武力劫走这些岛屿上的一万八千多中国人民。他们拆房烧屋，逼得人民无家可归，然后由美国海军陆战队以机关枪威胁那些不愿离开自己家园的人们登上美国运输舰，劫往台湾。许多拒绝离开的人都被蒋贼军所残杀。美国合众社在报道中引用了大陈岛的蒋贼军头子刘廉一的一句充满了血腥味的话说：“当我们离开时岛上将只剩下死人。”美国侵略军的这种灭绝人性的行为，和美国在朝鲜强迫扣留朝中战俘以及在越南唆使法军强力劫运华侨的行为一样，都是严重破坏人道的罪行。
    为了对大陈等岛屿实行焦土破坏，美国从日本调了“海军陆战队和陆军的专家”来进行这种罪恶工作。由于美国海军的爆破小组和蒋贼军的烧毁和爆破，大陈等岛屿已成了一片瓦砾场，这些岛上的民房、学校、商店和建筑物已无一存在。美国指使并直接参加蒋贼军的烧杀暴行，使人们更加认清了美国侵略军队是这样一种到处散布死亡和毁灭的军队。凡有良心和正义的人们一定不会饶恕这种血腥罪行的。
    美国军队和蒋贼军在大陈等岛屿犯下的滔天罪行，更加激起了中国人民的敌忾之心。我们要以加倍的努力来支持人民解放军的军事行动，迅速加强我国国防力量，为解放台湾、解放在美蒋奴役下的我国同胞而坚决奋斗。
