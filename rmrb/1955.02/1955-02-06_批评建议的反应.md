Responses to Criticism and Suggestions

    Review of the Overstocking of More Than 50,000 Sprayers
    Letter from the Department of Agriculture and Forestry of the People's Government of Henan Province: On December 5, 1954, the "People's Daily" "Letters from Readers" page published a letter from Comrade Chen Dianren exposing the serious fact that our department had overstocked more than 50,000 sprayers for many years without proper handling, causing great losses to the people's property, along with the investigation report from the "Letters from Readers" group. We believe that this criticism is correct and is of great help in improving the shortcomings and errors in our work. The reasons for this serious error are, first, a lack of sufficient understanding of the importance of promoting sprayers in terms of guiding ideology; second, there was serious blindness in formulating the promotion plan, proceeding from subjective wishes, lacking investigation and research, and not understanding the true situation at the grassroots level, thus making the plan divorced from reality. Third, we failed to specifically organize the promotion work and strengthen the extensive publicity of the promotion work; the organization was unsound, the subjective strength was weak, the management was poor, no one was specifically responsible, and the technical guidance was insufficient, so that farmers returned 3,835 units after the frost disaster in 1953 alone. Fourth, the leadership of the department had a serious bureaucratic style and lacked a high sense of responsibility for state property and the people's cause. The subordinate units held a simple attitude of distributing and pushing things out, and they had a poor understanding of how the sprayers were stored in various places and how they were being used by the masses. Fourth, there was a one-sided mass viewpoint in considering the handling of the overstocked sprayers.
    Regarding this batch of sprayers, in addition to the 45,000 units allocated by the central government to other provinces, we have decided on the following for the remaining part: concentrate the overstocked sprayers in appropriate areas (especially technical crop areas), actively promote them through supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels, and strengthen technical guidance; repair and process some of the missing parts and damaged parts; modify some of the spray guns and promote them in fruit tree areas. Finally, it needs to be explained that there are two discrepancies between the reader's letter and the investigation and the facts. "Interest alone amounts to 7.6 billion" should be "4.6 billion." Also, "the person in charge of the Henan Provincial Finance and Economics Committee" should be "the person in charge of the office of the Finance and Economics Committee."

    The Problem of Grass Shortage for Livestock in Shangqiu Prefecture Has Been Initially Resolved
    Letter from the Commissioner's Office of Shangqiu Prefecture, Henan Province: On December 19th of last year, the "Letters from Readers" page published Comrade Sheng Jianhua's critical letter "Transfer Surplus Fodder from Non-Disaster Areas to Disaster Areas." This situation and opinion are completely correct. We had a special study on solving the problem of fodder shortage for livestock in disaster areas at the economic meeting held on November 25th last year. It was decided that the main solution should be through self-regulation by each county; in addition, Taikang would purchase 15 million catties of cattle fodder to support Shenqiu, Dancheng, and Xiangcheng with 5 million catties each, Zecheng would transfer cattle fodder to support Luyi, and Yucheng and Xiayi would each transfer 1 million catties to support Yongcheng; in addition, we also tried to regulate 35 million catties. At present, Shenqiu, Dancheng, Luyi and other counties have regulated more than 8 million catties; and strengthened the education on loving and protecting livestock, and the massive deaths and indiscriminate slaughter of livestock have stopped. However, the problem of fodder shortage for livestock has not been completely resolved, and it is still an important task in our production and disaster relief work this spring. We will make the greatest efforts to solve this problem.

    Beijing and Jingdezhen Will Establish Technical Schools
    Letter from the General Office of the Ministry of Culture: On November 28, 1954, your newspaper's "Letters from Readers" page published the opinion of reader Zuo Jia, "We must pay attention to cultivating a new generation of craftsmen." After several studies by our ministry and relevant parties, it is planned to pilot two technical schools this year in Beijing and Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, to cultivate talents with a certain political and cultural level, basic art knowledge, and specialized skills (Beijing will train special arts and crafts artists, and Jingdezhen will train porcelain artists) to inherit and carry forward the excellent traditions of Chinese crafts. Currently, our ministry is urging the Central Academy of Fine Arts to study specific plans for building the schools with relevant parties.

### 批评建议的反应

专栏：批评建议的反应

    批评建议的反应
    关于积压五万多架喷雾器的检讨
    河南省人民政府农林厅来信：一九五四年十二月五日人民日报读者来信专页发表了读者陈典仁同志揭发我厅几年来积压五万多架喷雾器长期不作处理，使人民财产遭受很大损失的严重事实和读者来信组的调查意见，我们认为这个批评是正确的，对改进我们工作中的缺点和错误有很大帮助。造成这一严重错误的原因，首先是在领导思想上，对推广喷雾器工作的重要性认识不足；在制订推广计划中，又存在着严重的盲目性，从主观愿望出发，缺乏调查研究，不了解下边的真实情况，因而使计划脱离了实际。其次未能具体组织推广工作和加强对推广工作的广泛宣传；机构不健全，主观力量弱，经营管理不善，无专人负责，技术指导不够，因而仅一九五三年霜灾后农民就退回三、八三五架。第三是厅领导上官僚主义作风严重，缺乏对国家财产和人民事业的高度责任心，所属单位抱着单纯分运和推出了事的态度，至于喷雾器运到各地保管如何？贷到群众手里发挥的作用如何？了解的很差。第四，在考虑处理积压的喷雾器时有着片面的群众观点。
    现在这批喷雾器，除中央向外省调拨四万五千架外，其余部分我们决定：把积压在各地的喷雾器集中在适当地区（特别是技术作物地区），由各级供销社积极宣传，加强技术指导，进行推广；有些丢失零件和损坏的加以修配处理；改装一部分喷枪，在果树区推广。最后需要说明的，读者来信和调查有两处和事实有出入，“仅利息一项即达七十六亿”应为“四十六亿”。又“河南省财经委员会负责人”应为“财经委员会办公室负责人”。
    商邱专区牲口缺草问题已初步解决
    河南商邱专员公署来信：去年十二月十九日读者来信专页上发表了盛健华同志“把非灾区多余的草料调运到灾区去”的批评信，这个情况和意见是完全正确的。我们曾在去年十一月二十五日召开的经济会议上把解决灾区牲口缺草问题作了专题研究。当经决定主要由各县自行调剂解决；另由太康代购牛草一千五百万斤支援沈邱、郸城、项城各五百万斤，由柘城调出牛草支援鹿邑，由虞城、夏邑各调出一百万斤支援永城；另外还设法调剂了三千五百万斤。现在，沈邱、郸城、鹿邑等县已调剂八百多万斤；并加强了爱畜保畜教育，牲口大量死亡和滥杀现象已经停止。但牲口缺草问题尚未完全解决，仍是今春我们生产救灾工作中重要的工作，我们要以最大努力解决这一问题。
    北京市和景德镇将办技艺学校
    文化部办公厅来信：一九五四年十一月二十八日你报读者来信专页刊载了读者左嘉提出的“必须注意培养新一代的手工艺人”的意见，经我部同有关方面数次研究，拟于本年先在北京市和江西的景德镇两地试办两所技艺学校，培养具有一定的政治、文化水平、基本艺术知识和专门技艺的人才（北京培养特种工艺艺人，景德镇培养瓷器艺人），以继承和发扬我国工艺的优良传统。现我部正督促中央美术学院同有关方面研究建校具体计划。
