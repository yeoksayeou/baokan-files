Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The China Peace Committee cabled the All-India Peace Council on the 5th, congratulating India on holding the U.S. "Get Out of Taiwan Day" on the 6th. The text of the cable is as follows:
To the All-India Peace Council:
    The Chinese people express heartfelt congratulations to your council for calling on the Indian people to hold a movement on February 6th demanding that the United States withdraw from Taiwan. This is not only a just action by the Indian people but also contributes to easing international tensions and defending peace in Asia and the world. Taiwan is an indivisible part of Chinese territory. Liberating Taiwan is China's sovereignty and internal affair and brooks no interference from others. The Chinese people's exercise of their sovereignty to liberate their own territory has never caused international tension. The current tension in the Taiwan area is entirely caused by the U.S. government's occupation of Taiwan, interference in China's internal affairs, and separation of Chinese territory. The U.S. government's interference in China's internal affairs, expansion of aggression against China, preparation for a new war, and creation of tension in the Far East threaten China's security and peace in Asia and the world. Such war provocations by the U.S. government are not only intolerable to the Chinese people but have also been condemned by just world opinion.

    We must also point out that any attempt to split China, interfere in China's internal affairs, force the Chinese people to stop liberating Taiwan, and separate the coastal islands from Taiwan is, in effect, supporting U.S. aggression and is equally resolutely opposed by the Chinese people. To ease tension in the Far East and eliminate the threat of war, the United States must withdraw all its armed forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait.

    We wish your movement complete success. Long live Asian people's unity! Long live peace!

    China Peace Committee
    February 5, 1955, in Beijing

    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会
    电贺印度举行美国“撤出台湾日”
    【新华社六日讯】　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会五日致电全印和平理事会，祝贺印度定于六日举行美国“撤出台湾日”。电文如下：全印和平理事会：
    中国人民对于贵会号召印度人民于二月六日举行要求美国撤出台湾日的运动表示衷心的祝贺，这不仅是印度人民的正义行动，而且有助于和缓国际紧张局势和保卫亚洲及世界和平。台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。解放台湾是中国的主权和内政，决不容许他人干涉。中国人民行使自己的主权，解放自己的国土，从来没有引起国际局势的紧张。现在台湾地区的紧张局势，完全是由于美国政府侵占台湾、干涉中国内政、割裂中国领土所引起的。美国政府干涉中国内政，扩大对中国的侵略，准备新的战争，制造远东的紧张局势，威胁着中国的安全和亚洲及世界的和平。美国政府这种战争挑衅行为，不仅为中国人民所不能容忍，而且已经受到世界公正舆论的谴责。
    我们还必须指出，任何要分裂中国、干涉中国内政、强迫中国人民停止解放台湾和把沿海岛屿与台湾分开的企图，实际上是支持美国的侵略，同样为中国人民所坚决反对。为了和缓远东的紧张局势，消除战争的威胁，美国必须从台湾和台湾海峡撤走它的一切武装力量。
    祝你们的运动胜利成功。亚洲人民团结万岁！和平万岁！
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会
    一九五五年二月五日于北京
