Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 9th: The Korean Central News Agency reported on the 9th: The Korean Central News Agency is instructed to issue the following statement: At approximately 1300 hours on February 5th, eight U.S. F-86 type aircraft and one RB-45 type aircraft intruded into the airspace over the West Sea of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. At 1320 hours, they intruded into the area 10 kilometers south of Sinmi Island in North Pyongan Province, turned south, and continued to fly in the airspace of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. At 1323 hours, they were intercepted by fighters of the Korean People's Army over Hanchon, Pyongwon County, South Pyongan Province. The U.S. aircraft flew south along the west coast of Korea, passing over Sido and Chodo at 1339 hours.

At approximately 1300 hours on February 8th, eight U.S. F-86 type aircraft and one RB-45 type aircraft once again intruded into the airspace over the West Sea of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. At 1314 hours, they intruded into the area approximately 70 kilometers west of Hanchon, turned south, and at 1323 hours flew south, passing over Changsan Cape.

These intrusions by U.S. aircraft into the airspace of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea are a blatant violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement by the U.S. military authorities, and a provocative act attempting to further exacerbate the tense situation in the Far East caused by the current U.S. government's blatant interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China.

This military provocation by the U.S., like the frequent past acts of aggression it has committed, can only be seen as an attempt to escalate the serious threat to the Korean armistice.

Therefore, we strongly demand that the U.S. government take appropriate measures to prevent the recurrence of such provocative acts by U.S. armed forces.

If the U.S. authorities dare to carry out such provocative acts in violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement again, the U.S. government must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

    就美机侵犯朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领空
    朝鲜中央通讯社奉命发表声明
    【新华社平壤九日电】朝鲜中央通讯社九日讯：朝鲜中央通讯社奉命声明如下：二月五日十三时许，美国F八十六型飞机八架和RB四十五型飞机一架侵犯朝鲜民主主义人民共和国西海海上领空，十三时二十分侵入平安北道身弥岛以南十公里地区后转向南方，继续在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领空飞行。十三时二十三分，在平安南道平原郡汉川上空遭到朝鲜人民军战斗机阻击，美国飞机沿朝鲜西海岸在十三时三十九分经由席岛、椒岛上空向南飞去。
    二月八日十三时许，美国F八十六型飞机八架和RB四十五型飞机一架，再次侵犯朝鲜民主主义人民共和国西海海上领空，十三时十四分侵入汉川以西约七十公里地区后转向南飞，十三时二十三分经由长山串上空向南飞去。
    美国飞机对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国领空的这种侵犯，是美国军事当局横暴地违反朝鲜停战协定，而且也是企图进一步加剧由于目前美国政府对中华人民共和国内政的露骨干涉而造成的远东紧张局势的挑衅行为。
    美方的这种军事挑衅，和它过去曾经频繁制造的侵犯行为一样，只能被认为是企图扩大对朝鲜停战状态的严重威胁。
    因此，我们强硬地要求美国政府采取适当措施，以防止再发生美国武装力量的这种挑衅行为。
    美国当局如果敢再这样违反朝鲜停战协定进行挑衅，那么由此所产生的一切后果，必须由美国政府担负全部责任。
