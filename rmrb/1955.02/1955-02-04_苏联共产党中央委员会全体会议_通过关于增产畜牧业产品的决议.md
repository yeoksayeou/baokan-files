    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 2nd (TASS dispatch): The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held a plenary session from January 25th to 31st. The meeting adopted a resolution on "Increasing the Production of Animal Husbandry Products" based on the report of N.S. Khrushchev.

    The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU pointed out that, as a result of the implementation of the resolutions of the September Plenary Session, the February-March Plenary Session, and the June Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, as well as the various resolutions of the Party and the government, great achievements have been made in the past year in further developing the national economy and improving the welfare of the working people.

    Tremendous changes have taken place in our country's agriculture, and the necessary conditions are in place to further vigorously increase production in all sectors of agriculture. Investment in agriculture has greatly increased, and the technical equipment of machine tractor stations, state farms, and collective farms has been expanded. In 1954, socialist industry supplied agriculture with 137,000 general-purpose tractors (calculated at 15 horsepower per unit), 46,000 row-crop tractors, 37,000 grain harvesting combines, and hundreds of thousands of other agricultural machines. Much work has been done to strengthen machine tractor stations with skilled cadres, so that now the station directors, chief engineers, and repair shop directors of machine tractor stations are generally experts with higher or secondary education. There are now approximately two million tractor drivers, tractor team leaders, operators of complex agricultural machines, and other personnel who are included in the established staffing of machine tractor stations as permanent staff. There are now about 120,000 agronomists and animal husbandry experts directly participating in the production work of collective farms.

    The resolution went on to say that the total grain output of collective farms and state farms increased last year, and the state's grain procurement plan was completed ahead of schedule. Although some important grain-producing areas suffered from drought, the grain procured was still much more than in 1953.

    The measures taken to implement the resolution of the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU have increased the number of livestock of various products in the Soviet Union, thus increasing the production of meat, milk and eggs.

    At the same time, the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU believes that the current level of development of animal husbandry, especially in terms of livestock productivity and livestock numbers, cannot meet the growing needs of residents for livestock products, as well as the growing needs of light industry and the food industry for raw materials.

    The resolution said that the task of greatly increasing the production of animal husbandry products cannot be solved without further rapidly increasing the basis of the entire agricultural production – grain production. Socialist agriculture currently has all the necessary conditions to develop the country's enormous resources in order to rapidly increase the total grain output.

    The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU decided that the development of grain production should reach a level where the total national grain output is at least 10 billion poods per year by 1960, and this should be regarded as the most important national economic task. The Plenary Session adopted the resolution of the Central Committee of the CPSU and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on expanding the sown area of virgin and fallow land to at least 28 million to 30 million hectares in 1956.

    The Plenary Session attached great importance to expanding the sown area of ​​corn, which is the most important potential for increasing the total grain output, and believes that by 1960, the sown area of ​​corn must reach at least 28 million hectares.

    The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU believes that if the state increases the total grain output to 10 billion poods, it will be able to fully meet all needs for grain, establish more adequate grain reserves, expand foreign trade, and also supply animal husbandry with more than 4 billion poods of grain, as well as a large amount of wheat bran, soybean cake, and various compound feeds. Animal husbandry will obtain a solid foundation for development, will achieve high livestock productivity and produce a large amount of commodity livestock products, and the state will obtain the necessary amount of livestock products to meet the people's need for food and the industry's need for raw materials.

    The task of the Communist Party and the Soviet government is to bring the development of animal husbandry to a level that can guarantee the satisfaction of the continuously increasing needs of the residents for food and the industry for raw materials in the next few years. In order to complete this task, the production of major livestock products must be increased by two to more than two times in the next five to six years.

    The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU considers a extremely important national economic task to be: to double the production of meat, various fats, and milk in 1960 compared to 1954, to increase eggs by 2.2 times, and various wools by 1.8 times. To increase meat production, the most important thing is to rapidly develop pig farming, the earliest-maturing sector of animal husbandry, so that the proportion of pork in the total national meat production reaches 40 to 50 percent. It is also necessary to better organize the grazing and fattening of cattle and sheep, and to intensify the development of poultry farming.

    When organizing the indoor fattening of pigs in various regions of the country, it is necessary to widely use corn kernels and silage corn cobs, and to greatly expand the production of potatoes for this purpose.

    By the end of 1960, the indoor fattening, grazing fattening, and supplementary feeding of cattle and pigs must be expanded by about 2.5 times compared to 1954, and the indoor fattening of sheep and poultry should also be greatly expanded to ensure the mechanization of the indoor fattening process.

    The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU believes that the main task of increasing milk production is to rapidly improve the milk productivity of dairy cows. It must be ensured that in 1960, the milk production of dairy cows throughout the country is increased as follows: in collective farms, an average of at least 1,700 kilograms of milk per dairy cow, and in state farms, the milk production per dairy cow must not be less than 3,100 kilograms.

    In order to increase wool production, especially the production of fine-fiber wool and semi-fine-fiber wool, it is necessary to greatly increase the number of sheep on collective farms and state farms, and increase the average shearing amount, with each sheep shearing at least 3 kilograms per year in collective farms, and not less than 4.2 kilograms in state farms.

    It is an extremely important task to greatly increase the number of fine-fiber wool sheep and semi-fine-fiber wool sheep.

    In 1960, the number of poultry on collective farms and state farms should be increased by 2.5 to 3 times compared to 1954, and it was also decided to do everything possible to encourage the development of private poultry farming by collective farm members and employees. Poultry hatcheries must guarantee the hatching of at least 500 million chicks each year.

    The resolution of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU stipulated measures to strengthen the feed base for animal husbandry, as well as measures to ensure that livestock obtain a sufficient amount of concentrated feed, succulent feed, and roughage.

    The resolution pointed out that the experience of large-scale corn planting in 1954 shows that this crop can be harvested abundantly everywhere with proper cultivation, and compared with other crops, it can ensure that animal husbandry obtains high-quality concentrated feed and silage feed with the least amount of labor.

    The resolution stipulates that the feed production of collective farms and state farms should be increased as follows in 1960: concentrated feed should be increased to at least 65 million tons, which is more than five times that of 1953; silage feed should be increased to at least 176 million tons, which is five and a half times that of 1953; root crops and feed melon crops should be increased to at least 38 million tons, which is four times that of 1953; potatoes should be increased to at least 25 million tons, which is five times that of 1953; roughage should be increased to 178 million tons, which is one and a half times that of 1953.

    The resolution also said that at present, when the struggle for the rapid upsurge of animal husbandry has become an extremely important task in our country, the role and responsibility of machine tractor stations in developing the production of this agricultural sector will increase infinitely. Efforts must be made to ensure that, in the near future, machine tractor stations, like in field operations, will become the decisive force in the production of meat, milk, wool, and other livestock products, and that the entire process of feed preparation and other work in livestock farms will be mechanized.

    The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU suggested that relevant ministries formulate measures within three months to increase the production of machines and machinery to mechanize laborious work in animal husbandry and feed production, and submit them to the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union for review. When formulating these measures, attention must be paid to manufacturing a complete set of machines for various regions of the country that can mechanize feed production, feed silage, water supply work, and feed preparation work, and electrify the laborious work processes of livestock farms. The resolution also stipulated many other measures to further mechanize laborious work in animal husbandry.

    A special part of the resolution talked about the issue of collective farms building livestock housing and buildings for preserving feed.

    The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU pointed out that due to the measures taken by the Party and the government to develop agriculture, the income of collective farms and collective farm members has greatly increased. Now collective farms have more potential than ever before to allocate funds to expand production, especially for construction. The investment of collective farms must be used for the development of the collective farm's economy so that it can obtain very high income, and first of all, the construction of houses for production purposes must be carried out.

    The resolution stipulates that from 1955 to 1960, collective farms should expand the construction of livestock barns sufficient to accommodate public livestock and build the necessary buildings for preserving silage feed. For this purpose, the resolution stipulated measures to increase the production of local building materials and other measures.

    State farms occupy an important position in increasing the production of livestock products. The resolution pointed out that many state farms have extremely vast land, advanced technical equipment, and very skilled cadres, so they are given a task: to ensure the full and rational use of land, and to further greatly increase the production of livestock products in state farms, and greatly reduce product costs. The meeting believes that in 1960, meat production must be increased by at least 1.8 times that of 1954, milk by 2.8 times, wool by 2.2 times, and eggs by 4 times. The resolution also stipulates that the level of mechanization of laborious work in livestock farms should be greatly improved, and the electrification of state farms should be implemented.

    The resolution pointed out that due to the increase in the production and procurement of livestock products, the people's consumption level has been further improved. Compared with 1940, meat sold to residents in 1954 increased by 2.8 times, animal oil increased by 2.6 times, eggs increased by 1.4 times, and woolen fabrics increased by nearly 3 times. The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU decided that, on the basis of increasing livestock productivity and increasing the number of livestock, the total procurement and acquisition of livestock products in 1960 will increase compared with 1954 as follows: meat will increase by at least 1.6 times, pigs will increase by at least 2.8 times, milk and dairy products will increase by at least 1.8 times, eggs will increase by more than 3 times, and wool will increase by 2 times.

    A special part of the resolution talked about improving the leadership of agriculture and improving the Party's political work in rural areas.

    The resolution concluded: In the struggle to further strengthen the strength of the Soviet state, the Communist Party believes that its main task is to further develop heavy industry, and on this basis, make all sectors of the national economy achieve new upsurges, and continuously improve the living welfare of the Soviet people. In addition to a strong industry, there must also be a highly developed agriculture in order to produce enough grain and raw materials to continuously supply residents with consumer goods and industry with raw materials. Public animal husbandry should play an important role in this regard. Developing and strengthening public animal husbandry in collective farms can promote the improvement of the entire agricultural production, promote the further consolidation of collective farms organizationally and economically, and further improve the material welfare of collective farm members.

    The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU called on all male and female collective farm members, as well as staff members of machine tractor stations and state farms, to do everything possible to victoriously implement the planned further development of agriculture and animal husbandry, so that the country can have an abundant supply of various agricultural products in the near future.

    The Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the CPSU believes that under the leadership of the Communist Party, the workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals, all the Soviet people, will definitely victoriously complete this extremely important task in the shortest possible time.

    苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议
    通过关于增产畜牧业产品的决议
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科二月二日电：苏联共产党中央委员会在一月二十五日到三十一日举行了全体会议，会议根据尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫的报告通过了“关于增加畜牧业产品生产”的决议。
    苏共中央全会指出，由于执行了党中央九月全会、二—三月全会和六月全会的决议以及党和政府的各项决议，过去一年在进一步发展国民经济和增进劳动人民福利方面取得了巨大的成就。
    在我国农业中发生了巨大的变化，已经具备了进一步大力提高农业生产各部门的必要条件。对农业的投资大大地增加了，机器拖拉机站、国营农场和集体农庄的技术装备扩充了。社会主义工业在一九五四年为农业供应了十三万七千台一般用拖拉机 （每台以十五匹马力计算）、四万六千台中耕用拖拉机、三万七千台谷物收割联合机以及几十万台其他农业机器。在用熟练干部加强机器拖拉机站方面做了不少工作，因此，现在担任机器拖拉机站站长、总工程师和修配厂主任职务的，一般都是具有高等或中等教育程度的专家。现在，共有约两百万拖拉机手、拖拉机工作队队长、复杂的农业机器的操使者以及其他一些工作人员，被作为固定的工作人员列入机器拖拉机站编制。现在直接参加集体农庄生产工作的农艺师和畜牧专家约有十二万人。
    决议接着说，去年集体农庄和国营农场的谷物总产量增加了，国家征购粮食的计划提前完成了。虽然一些重要的产粮区遭受了干旱，但征购的粮食还是比一九五三年多得多。
    为执行苏共中央九月全体会议的决议而采取的措施，使苏联各种产品牲畜的头数增加了，因而肉类、奶类和鸡蛋的产量也增加了。
    同时，苏共中央全体会议认为：目前，畜牧业发展的水平，特别是在畜产品生产率和牲畜头数方面，并不能满足居民对畜产品日益增长的需求，以及轻工业和食品工业对原料的日益增长的需求。
    决议说，如果不进一步急速提高整个农业生产的基础——谷物生产，那么大大增加畜牧业产品生产量的任务就不可能获得解决。社会主义农业目前具有一切必要的条件来发挥国内拥有的巨大富源，以便急速地增加谷物的总产量。
    苏共中央全体会议决定：谷物生产的发展要在一九六○年达到全国谷物的总产量至少每年有一百亿普特的水平，应当认为这是一个最重要的国民经济任务。全体会议通过了苏共中央和苏联部长会议关于在一九五六年把生荒地和熟荒地区的播种面积至少扩大到两千八百万—三千万公顷的决议。
    全体会议十分重视扩大作为增加谷物总产量最重要的潜力的玉蜀黍的播种面积，并且认为到一九六○年，玉蜀黍的播种面积必须至少达到两千八百万公顷。
    苏共中央全体会议认为，国家若将谷物总产量增加到一百亿普特，那就能够完全满足对粮食的全部需要，建立更加充足的粮食储备，扩大对外贸易，同时还可以拿四十多亿普特谷物以及大量的麦麸、豆饼和各种配合饲料供给畜牧业的需要。畜牧业将获得巩固的发展基础，将会达到很高的畜产品生产率和生产很多的商品畜产品，国家将得到必需数量的畜产品来满足人民对食品的需要和工业对原料的需要。
    共产党和苏联政府的任务是，在最近几年内要使畜牧业的发展达到能够保证满足居民对食品、工业对原料的不断增长的需要的水平。为了完成这项任务，必须在最近五、六年内将主要的畜产品的生产增加到两倍以至两倍以上。
    苏共中央全会认为一项极重要的国民经济任务是：在一九六零年把肉类、各种脂肪和奶类的生产增为一九五四年的两倍，蛋类增为二点二倍，各种羊毛增为一点八倍。要增加肉类的生产首先应当迅速发展养猪业这个最早熟的畜牧业部门，使全国肉类生产的总量中猪肉的比重达到百分之四十到五十，还应当更好地组织牛和绵羊的放牧肥育和舍饲肥育，加紧发展养禽业。
    在全国各地区组织猪的舍饲肥育时，必须广泛地利用玉蜀黍的籽粒和青储的玉蜀黍棒心，并且要为这一目的而大力扩大马铃薯的生产。
    到一九六○年底，牛和猪的舍饲肥育、放牧肥育和补培必须约扩大为一九五四年的二·五倍，还应当大大扩大羊和家禽的舍饲肥育，保证舍饲肥育过程的机械化。
    苏共中央全体会议认为，增加牛奶生产的主要任务是急速提高奶牛的奶的生产率。必须保证在
  一九六○年把全国的奶牛挤奶量增加如下：在集体农庄中平均一头奶牛最少出奶一千七百公斤，而在国营农场中每头奶牛的出奶量不得少于三千一百公斤。
    为了增加羊毛的生产，特别是增加细纤维羊毛和次细纤维羊毛的生产，必须大大地增加集体农庄和国营农场的羊的只数，并且提高平均剪毛量，在集体农庄中每只羊每年最少剪毛三公斤，而在国营农场中则不得少于四点二公斤。
    大量增加细纤维毛羊和次细纤维毛羊的只数，是极其重要的任务。
    一九六○年，集体农庄和国营农场的家禽的只数和一九五四年比较应当增为二·五倍到三倍，同时决定尽力鼓励集体农庄庄员和职工私人养禽业的发展。孵禽站必须保证每年最少孵出五亿只雏鸡。
    苏共中央全体会议的决议规定了关于加强畜牧业饲料基地的措施，以及保证牲畜获得足够数量的精饲料、多汁饲料和粗饲料的措施。
    决议指出，一九五四年大规模种植玉蜀黍的经验表明，这种农作物在适当的耕作下到处都可以获得丰收，并且和其他农作物比较，可以花费最少的劳力而保证畜牧业获得品质优良的精饲料和青储饲料。
    决议规定一九六○年集体农庄和国营农场的饲料生产增加如下：精饲料最少增加到六千五百万吨，即增为一九五三年的五倍以上；青储饲料最少增加到一亿七千六百万吨，即增为一九五三年的五倍半；块根饲料、饲料瓜类作物最少增加到三千八百万吨，即增为一九五三年的四倍；马铃薯至少增加到两千五百万吨，即增为一九五三年的五倍；粗饲料增加到一亿七千八百万吨，即增加到一九五三年的一倍半。
    决议还说，目前，在争取畜牧业的急速高涨已经成为我国极重大的任务的情况下，机器拖拉机站在发展这一农业部门的生产中的作用和责任将无限地增长。必须努力做到：在最近时期中，机器拖拉机站像在田间作业中一样，要成为肉类、奶类、羊毛和其他畜产品生产中的决定性力量，使调制饲料和饲畜场的其他工作全盘机械化。
    苏共中央全体会议建议有关各部，在三个月内拟定为使畜牧业和饲料生产中的费力劳动机械化而增产机器和机械的措施，提交苏联部长会议和苏联共产党中央委员会审查。在制订这些措施的时候，必须注意为全国各地区制造出使饲料的生产、饲料的青储、给水工作和调制饲料的工作机械化以及饲畜场费力劳动过程电气化的全套机器。决议还规定了使畜牧业中的费力工作进一步机械化的其他许多措施。
     决议中专门有一部分谈到集体农庄建设牲畜房舍和保藏饲料的建筑物的问题。
    苏共中央全体会议指出，由于党和政府采取发展农业的措施，集体农庄和集体农庄庄员的收入大大增加了。现在集体农庄比以前任何时候都有可能拨款扩大生产，特别是进行建设。集体农庄的投资必须用于发展集体农庄的经济，使它能获得很高的收入，首先必须进行供生产用途的房屋的建设。
    决议规定在一九五五到一九六零年内，在集体农庄扩大建设足够容纳公有牲畜的畜舍和建设保藏青储饲料所必要的建筑物，为了这个目的，决议规定了增加地方性建筑材料的生产的措施和其他措施。
    国营农场在增加畜产品的生产中占着重要的地位。决议指出，许多国营农场拥有极广大的土地、先进的技术设备和非常熟练的干部，因此向它们提出一项任务：保证充分地和合理地使用土地，在国营农场中进一步大力增加畜产品的生产，大大降低产品成本。会议认为，在一九六○年，肉类的生产至少必须增为一九五四年的一点八倍，牛奶增为二点八倍，羊毛增为二点二倍，蛋类增为四倍。决议还规定大力提高畜牧农场费力工作的机械化水平，并且实施国营农场的电气化。
    决议指出，由于畜产品生产和征购量的增加，人民的消费水平已经进一步提高了。和一九四○年比较，一九五四年出售给居民的肉类增加为二点八倍，动物油增为二点六倍，蛋类增为一点四倍，毛织品将近增为三倍。苏共中央全会决定，在提高牲畜产品生产率和增加牲畜头数的基础上，一九六○年的畜产品征购和收购总量，比一九五四年增加的情况如下：肉类至少增加为一点六倍，猪至少增为二点八倍，牛奶和奶类产品至少增为一点八倍，蛋类增为三倍多，羊毛增为二倍。
    决议中专门有一部分谈到了改进对农业的领导和改进农村中党的政治工作。
    决议最后说：在争取进一步加强苏维埃国家的力量的斗争中，共产党认为自己主要的任务是进一步发展重工业，在这一基础上使国民经济的各个部门得到新的高涨，并且不断提高苏联人民的生活福利。除了要有强大的工业之外，还必须要有高度发展的农业，以便生产足够的粮食和原料来不断地为居民供应消费品，为工业供应原料。公有畜牧业在这方面应该起重要的作用。发展和加强集体农庄中公有畜牧业，可以促进整个农业生产的提高，促使集体农庄在组织上和经济上进一步巩固，并进一步增进集体农庄庄员的物质福利。
    苏共中央全体会议号召全体集体农庄男女庄员以及机器拖拉机站和国营农场的工作人员，尽一切力量胜利地去执行规定的进一步发展农业和畜牧业的计划，以便使国家在最近几年中有充裕的各种农产品。
    苏共中央全会相信：在共产党的领导下，工人、集体农民和知识分子，全体苏联人民一定会在最短时期内胜利地完成这项极重要的任务。
