    Strengthening Meteorological Forecasting Work in Mountainous Areas
    The Guizhou Provincial Meteorological Bureau is currently increasing the number of meteorological observatories and stations, and supplementing observation instruments and equipment, based on the special needs of mountainous climates, and is also strengthening technical research work.
    In its meteorological forecasting work last year, the Guizhou Provincial Meteorological Bureau powerfully supported agricultural production in mountainous areas. Last year, the Guizhou Provincial Meteorological Bureau and the Provincial People's Broadcasting Station signed a meteorological broadcasting contract, so that each wind and rain forecast could be quickly relayed by more than 180 radio stations scattered in the vast mountainous areas to local farmers. The Meteorological Bureau issued 105 disastrous weather forecasts, with an accuracy rate of over 85%. During the spring ploughing season last year, the Meteorological Bureau issued a frost forecast in advance, and the people of all ethnic groups in Tongren, Xingyi, Bijie and other regions extended the rice sowing period, and at the same time rushed to harvest the minor spring crops, so that the seedlings and minor spring crops avoided losses. In May last year, the Meteorological Bureau promptly issued a rainstorm warning, which also enabled crops in various places to avoid or reduce disasters. Farmers in Wengan, Tongren, Meitan and other counties wrote letters to the Meteorological Bureau to express their gratitude.

    加强山区气象预报工作
    贵州省气象局现正根据山区气候的特殊需要，增设气象台、站和充实观测仪器设备，并加强技术研究工作。
    贵州省气象局在去年一年的气象预报工作中有力地支援了山区农业生产。去年，贵州省气象局和省人民广播电台订立了气象广播合同，每次风雨预报都能由分散在广大山区的一百八十多个收音站迅速向当地农民转播。气象局先后发出灾害性的天气预报一百零五次，准确率达到百分之八十五以上。去年春耕期间，气象局事先进行了寒冻预报，铜仁、兴义、毕节等专区的各族农民便延长水稻播种时期，同时抢收小春作物，使秧种和小春作物避免了损失。去年五月间，气象局及时发布了暴雨警报，也使各地农作物避免或减轻了灾害。瓮安、铜仁、湄潭等县的农民纷纷写信向气象局表示感谢。
