Guangdong Completes Cooperative Establishment Plan Before Spring Plowing

The work of developing agricultural producers' cooperatives in Guangdong Province during the past winter and spring has been successfully completed according to the planned schedule. As of now, Guangdong Province has newly established more than 11,900 agricultural producers' cooperatives. Together with the existing old cooperatives, the province has a total of more than 13,000 agricultural producers' cooperatives. Except for areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, every district now has cooperatives. Recently, the South China Bureau issued instructions requiring all localities to earnestly consolidate existing agricultural producers' cooperatives and do a good job in spring production. Party committees at the district and county levels have successively established production headquarters to actively lead the spring production campaign. Currently, these cooperatives are actively engaged in spring plowing or preparing for plowing. For example, the more than 600 cooperatives in the Hainan District will convert more than 23,000 mu of single-cropping fields into double-cropping fields, reclaim wasteland to expand the cultivated area by more than 30,000 mu, and accumulate more than 100 million jin of fertilizer.

    广东完成春耕前建社计划
    广东省去冬今春发展农业生产合作社的工作，已按预定计划胜利完成。到目前为止，广东省已新建了一万一千九百多个农业生产合作社，连同原有老社全省共有一万三千多个农业生产合作社。除少数民族地区以外，已达到区区有社。最近华南分局发出指示，要求各地认真巩固现有的农业生产合作社，做好春季生产工作。各区党委和县委已先后成立生产指挥部，积极领导春季生产运动。目前这些社正在积极进行春耕或备耕工作。如海南区的六百多个社，将把二万三千多亩单造田改为双造田，开荒扩大耕地面积三万多亩，积肥一亿斤以上。
