How the Tangfan Township Branch of Mianyang County, Sichuan Province Relied on the Branch to Run Agricultural Production Cooperatives Well
　　熊光群

Under the circumstances of the rapid development of the rural mutual aid and cooperation movement, overcoming the work style of the work team's taking over everything and relying on the branch to carry out work is an important key to doing a good job in building cooperatives. In this cooperative building work, the Tangfan Township work team in Mianyang County, Sichuan Province, began to change its work style, conscientiously cultivate and help the branch improve its leadership ability, so that the cooperative building work could be carried out smoothly.

Tangfan Township in Mianyang County has a total of sixteen villages, with 4,401 peasant households. In addition to the nine existing cooperatives in the township (three old cooperatives and six new cooperatives built before last autumn) to be expanded, thirty-six new cooperatives must be built this time to achieve basic collectivization throughout the township. This task is very arduous. In the past, the Tangfan Township Branch did not directly lead the work of building cooperatives, let alone have experience in leading the large-scale work of building cooperatives. In addition, in previous movements, the work of this township was long "taken over" by the work team. The branch lacked the ability to work independently, and the branch secretary and branch committee members all had ideas of dependence. On November 19th last year, when the construction of cooperatives began, the Mianyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China transferred Comrade Gan Chaode, a member of the District Committee of the District, to serve as the first secretary of the Tangfan Township Party Branch, and Comrade He Farong, the original secretary of the township branch, as the second secretary. And Comrade Yuan Yisheng, a member of the County Committee and Minister of Propaganda of the County Committee, led six cadres to form a work team and arrived in Tangfan Township. His task was: to rely on the branch to do a good job in building cooperatives, and to pay attention to cultivating the branch's ability to run cooperatives independently.

At the beginning of the construction of cooperatives, the cadres of the work team generally had the following ideas:
"The task is large, there are few cadres, and even one cadre is not assigned to two villages, how can it be done well?" Some people even felt anxious because they could not "take over" the work. They were somewhat "distrustful" of the practice of "relying on the branch to run the cooperatives." For example, when the branch assigned branch committee member Wu Chao Hou (director of the old cooperative) to manage a supporting point (building seven cooperatives), cadre Tang Jishu of the work team said:
"He can't even handle his own cooperative, how can he manage a supporting point? How can he run around?" The leaders of the work team criticized these erroneous understandings of the cadres, and clearly pointed out that the work team must establish a viewpoint of trusting and relying on the masses. At the same time, they also pointed out the evil consequences of past practices of taking over everything, educated cadres to learn lessons, and sent six cadres to six supporting points (each supporting point had one to two general cooperatives) to assist in the work. After the work started, because the ideological problems of the cadres were not completely resolved, the work style of taking over everything reappeared. After the cadres went to the supporting points, they only grasped the work of the general cooperatives and did not pay attention to helping and driving the construction work of the remaining branch cooperatives. In response to this situation, the leaders again emphasized: the task of the work team cadres is mainly to help the director of the general cooperative's preparatory committee do a good job in one key cooperative, and to guide the branch cooperatives; the director of the general cooperative's preparatory committee should first do a good job in his own cooperative, take the lead, and create experience to drive the branch cooperatives. Since then, the work style of the work team cadres has begun to change. For example, when the work of building cooperatives entered the stage of dealing with specific problems, the work team selected four cadres as assistants to the branch secretary, formed an inspection team to conduct patrols in the township, reported the problems found to the branch secretary, and according to the results of the branch's collective research, put forward solutions to help the branch secretary discover and solve problems in the movement in a timely manner.

In the work of relying on the branch to run cooperatives, the Tangfan Township cooperative building work team paid special attention to cultivating and improving the leadership ability of the branch secretary through the work of building cooperatives. There are the following experiences in this regard:

Constantly help the branch secretary to clarify relevant policies, first of all, to enable the branch secretary to adhere to the Party's policies in the branch committee, which is an important key to ensuring that the branch committee can correctly lead the construction of cooperatives. For example, when studying the collectivization plan and work arrangements for the entire township, Branch Secretary Gan Chaode was blindly optimistic and wanted to run large cooperatives (because he had run cooperatives in the past and saw that the masses were enthusiastic about joining the cooperatives, he thought the problem was not big). The leaders of the work team pointed out that his mood was wrong and helped him correctly understand the favorable conditions and specific difficulties of this cooperative building. Later, at the branch committee meeting to study the collectivization plan for the entire township, Comrade Gan Chaode took the lead in examining and criticizing the idea of blindly running large cooperatives, and inspired everyone to fully discuss the favorable conditions and difficulties in building cooperatives, and unified everyone's understanding. Branch committee members Song Tianfa, Jia Xintian, Wu Chao Hou, etc., all realistically reduced their originally planned expansion plans. Thanks to the help of the work team, the branch secretary and branch committee members had clear ideas, and in the process of ideological mobilization, they were able to pay attention to correcting the impatience of Party members and cadres at any time. For example, in the process of reviewing, determining and cultivating cooperative building backbones, the work team especially educated the branch to implement the Party's fundamental line of socialist transformation in rural areas, and pay attention to selecting politically progressive, historically clear, fair and capable poor peasant backbones for cultivation.

Help the branch hold various meetings inside and outside the Party well. Every major issue in the construction of cooperatives is fully discussed through the branch committee, branch general meeting, mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting, and mutual aid and cooperation committee. Before holding these meetings, the cadres of the work team and the branch secretary carefully studied the ideological situation of the masses, put forward the problems to be solved; and tried their best to put forward problems with preparation, or inspire the masses to put forward problems, fully discuss them, and then make decisions. In this way, the situation of "one person making a report and everyone speaking less" in past meetings has gradually changed, and each meeting has a clear center and can truly solve problems. In particular, it emphasized the construction of cooperatives by the whole Party and strengthened the collective leadership of the branch committee and the sense of responsibility of Party members. After clarifying the task of building cooperatives, all Party members of the branch were able to give full play to their high enthusiasm. For example, when reviewing the backbones, Party members repeatedly researched at the branch general meeting. After the end of the second stage, many Party members also voluntarily proposed that in addition to cultivating cooperative affairs committee members, attention should also be paid to cultivating production team leaders and group leaders.

Help the branch secretary learn the leadership method of combining "points and surface." The two branch secretaries, one grasped the overall situation, the other delved into key points, discovered problems, and submitted them to the branch committee and the mutual aid and cooperation committee for discussion and resolution with preparation. In this way, the branch secretary's ability to work independently was cultivated and improved. For example, during the propaganda and mobilization stage, Comrade Gan Chaode discovered that the preparatory committees for building cooperatives in the Tenth Village all had impatient emotions. In addition to promptly telling the preparatory committee for building cooperatives in the village about these problems, Comrade Gan Chaode also raised them for discussion at the township mutual aid and cooperation committee, which aroused the attention of various villages, and all checked the shortcomings of the propaganda and mobilization being not universal and in-depth; at the same time, they criticized the blind optimism in the work, and the villages with relatively large problems also conducted make-up lessons. Another branch secretary, He Farong, delved into the cooperative building group of the Sixteenth Village and also found some problems, which he brought to the attention of the branch committee and the mutual aid and cooperation committee as soon as possible. For example, in the publicity of the Party's fundamental line of socialist transformation in rural areas, it was found that the preparatory committee members themselves did not understand it and could not lead the masses to conduct in-depth discussions on this policy (later, the preparatory committee members of all cooperative building groups in the township were generally organized to study and then publicized it to the masses); for example, when electing cooperative cadres, it was found that the prior deliberation was not sufficient, and there was a phenomenon of cadres taking over everything in the election, etc., all of which were promptly brought to the attention of the branch leadership, so that the remaining villages could avoid detours or not take detours in the election.

In addition to the above work, the work team also helped the branch closely rely on various organizations to carry out work. For example, in each stage of building cooperatives, in addition to convening a township mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting to discuss and deploy work, the branch often relied on the mutual aid and cooperation committee (composed of seventeen people, all branch committee members participated, and all nine general cooperative preparatory committee directors participated) to carry out work. Through the mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting and the mutual aid and cooperation committee, the branch's leadership intentions are implemented from top to bottom, and the opinions of the masses are concentrated from bottom to top. In this way, the branch played a core leadership role in the construction of cooperatives, and at the same time, the mutual aid and cooperation representative meeting, the committee, and the general and branch cooperative preparatory committees all established prestige among the masses. Now, when the masses have problems, they mostly find the preparatory committee to solve them. If the branch cooperative preparatory committee cannot solve them, they find the general cooperative, and if the general cooperative cannot solve them, they raise the problems to the township mutual aid and cooperation committee for research and resolution. Many preparatory committee cadres reflected: Now that there are no work cadres directly participating, we can also run cooperatives.

As of January 20th this year, the township's work of building and expanding cooperatives has come to an end. The vast majority of cooperatives have elected cooperative affairs committee members and held founding meetings. Thirty-six new cooperatives and nine expanded cooperatives have absorbed a total of 1,960 peasant households into the cooperatives. In addition to the households that have joined the existing cooperatives, the number of peasant households in the township that have joined the cooperatives has accounted for 52 percent of the total number of households.

    四川省绵阳县塘泛乡怎样依靠支部办好农业生产合作社
    熊光群
    在农村互助合作运动迅速发展的情况下，克服工作组的包办代替作风，依靠支部进行工作，是做好建社工作的重要关键。四川省绵阳县塘泛乡工作组在这次建社工作中，开始转变了工作作风，认真培养和帮助支部提高领导能力，使建社工作顺利开展。
    绵阳县塘泛乡共有十六个村，有农户四千四百零一户。全乡除原有九个社（三个老社、六个去年秋前新建社）要进行扩大外，这次还要新建三十六个社，要达到全乡基本合作化，这个任务是很艰巨的。塘泛乡支部过去没有直接领导建社工作，更没有领导大规模建社工作的经验；加以在历次运动中，这个乡的工作长期由工作组“包办”，支部缺乏独立工作的能力，支部书记、支部委员都有依赖思想。去年十一月十九日建社开始，中共绵阳县委会抽调了该区区委会委员甘朝德同志去担任塘泛乡党支部第一书记，原该乡支部书记何发荣同志作第二书记。并由县委会委员、县委会宣传部长袁义生同志带领六个干部组成工作组，到达塘泛乡。他的任务是：依靠支部做好建社工作，并注意培养支部独立办社的能力。
    建社开始时，工作组干部普遍存在的思想是：
  “任务大，干部少，两个村还分不到一个干部，怎么搞得好？”有的人甚至因“包办”不下来而焦急。他们对于“依靠支部办社”的作法，有些“信不过”。如当支部分配支部委员吴朝厚（老社社长）搞一个支点（建七个社）时，工作组干部唐基述说：
  “他搞自己那个社都不得了，要搞一个支点，看他怎么跑得过来！”工作组领导上对干部中的这些错误认识作了批判，并明确提出：工作组必须树立相信群众、依靠群众的观点。同时还指出过去包办代替的恶果，教育干部接受教训，并将六个干部分别派至六个支点（每个支点有一个至两个总社）去协助工作。工作开始后，由于干部思想问题解决得不彻底，包办作风又露头。干部下到支点后，只抓了总社的工作，未注意帮助和带动其余分社的建社工作。针对这种情况，领导上又强调提出：工作组干部的任务主要是帮助总社筹委会主任做好一个重点社的工作，指导分社；总社筹委会主任应首先搞好自己的社，先行一步，作出经验来带动分社。自此以后，工作组干部的作法开始有了转变。例如当建社工作进入处理具体问题阶段时，工作组抽出四个干部当支部书记的助手，组成检查组在乡内巡回检查，将发现的问题向支部书记汇报，根据支部集体研究的结果，提出解决办法，帮助支部书记及时地发现和解决运动中的问题。
    塘泛乡建社工作组在依靠支部办社的工作中，特别注意了通过建社工作培养和提高支部书记的领导能力。在这方面有以下一些经验：
    经常帮助支部书记弄清有关政策，首先使支部书记在支委会中能坚持党的政策，这是保证支委会在建社中能正确地进行领导的重要关键。如在开始研究全乡合作化计划及工作安排时，支部书记甘朝德盲目乐观，想办大社（因他过去办过社，又看见群众入社热情高，便认为问题不大），工作组领导上指出他这种情绪不对，帮助他正确认识这次建社的有利条件和具体困难。后来在支委会研究全乡合作化计划时，甘朝德同志带头检查批判了盲目贪办大社的思想，并启发大家充分讨论建社的有利条件和困难，统一了大家的认识。支部委员宋天发、贾新田、吴朝厚等，都将自己原订的扩社计划实事求是地缩小了。由于工作组的帮助，支部书记、支部委员思想明确，在思想发动过程中，能随时注意纠正党员、干部中的急躁情绪。又如在审查确定和培养办社骨干过程中，工作组又特别教育支部要贯彻党在农村中实行社会主义改造的根本路线，注意选择政治进步、历史清楚和公道能干的贫农骨干进行培养。
    帮助支部开好党内外的各种会议。建社中的每一重大问题，都通过支委会、支部大会、互助合作代表会、互助合作委员会的充分讨论。在召开这些会议前，工作组的干部和支部书记仔细研究了群众思想情况，提出要解决的问题；并尽量作到有准备地提出问题，或启发群众提出问题，充分讨论，然后作出决定。这样，逐渐改变了以往开会时“一人作报告，大家发言少”的状况，而且每次会议中心明确，能真正解决问题。特别是强调了全党办社，加强了支委会的集体领导和党员的责任感。支部的全体党员，在明确了建社任务后，都能发挥高度的积极性，如在审查骨干时，党员们在支部大会上反复地进行了研究。在第二阶段结束后，不少党员还自动提出除培养社务委员外，还要注意培养生产队长和组长。
    帮助支部书记学会“点面结合”的领导方法。两个支部书记，一人掌握全面，一人深入重点，发现问题，有准备地提交支委会、互助合作委员会讨论解决。这样，便培养和提高了支部书记独立工作的能力。如甘朝德同志在宣传动员阶段，发现十村建社筹备委员都有急躁情绪。甘朝德同志除及时地将这些问题告诉该村建社筹委会外，还在乡互助合作委员会提出来研究，引起各村重视，都检查了宣传动员中不普遍、不深入的缺点；同时批判了工作中的盲目乐观情绪，部分问题较大的村还进行了补课。另一个支部书记何发荣，深入十六村建社组，也摸出一些问题，提起了支委会和互助合作委员会的及早注意。如在宣传党在农村中实行社会主义改造的根本路线中，发现筹备委员自己不懂，不能领导群众深入讨论这一政策（后来全乡各建社组都普遍组织筹备委员进行了学习，再向群众宣传）；又如在选举社干部时，发现事先酝酿不充分，选举中干部有包办现象等问题后，都及时地提起支部领导注意，使其余各村在选举中少走或不走弯路。
    除以上工作外，工作组还帮助支部密切依靠各种组织进行工作。如在建社每一阶段，支部除召开全乡互助合作代表会讨论和布置工作外，经常依靠互助合作委员会（共十七人组成，支部委员全部参加，九个总社筹备委员会主任全部参加）进行工作。通过互助合作代表会、互助合作委员会从上而下贯彻支部领导意图，从下而上集中群众意见，这样使支部在建社中发挥了核心领导作用，同时使互助合作代表会、委员会以及总社、分社筹委会在群众中都建立了威信。现在群众有了问题，大多是找筹委会解决，分社筹委会不能解决的就找总社，总社不能解决的再把问题提到乡互助合作委员会上研究解决。不少筹委会的干部反映：这下没有工作干部直接参加，我们也能办社了。
    到今年一月二十日止，该乡建社、扩社工作已告一段落。绝大部分社已选出社务委员，开了成立大会。三十六个新建社及九个扩建社，共吸收了一千九百六十户农民入社，加上原有社的入社户，全乡入社农户已占总户数的百分之五十二。
