    Anshan Iron and Steel Successfully Test-Rolls No. 40 I-Beam Steel

    Anshan Iron and Steel's Large Rolling Mill and Blooming Mill collaborated to successfully test-roll a new product—No. 40 I-beam steel—on February 3rd. This is another achievement in China's steel rolling industry. This large I-beam steel is a necessary material for building large factories and tall structures such as large bridges. According to the design capacity of the large rolling mill, it is impossible to roll this kind of large I-beam steel. However, with the personal assistance of Soviet experts, the pass design of the blooming mill's blooming machine was modified, and the blooming mill test-rolled large cross-section special-shaped steel billets. This is equivalent to adding a blooming machine in front of the large rolling mill. Soviet experts also personally completed the pass design of the No. 40 I-beam steel. The steel rolling section of the large mill prepared brand-new saw blades with large diameters, and pre-installation of the rollers and guide plates was carried out before the test rolling. The test rolling began at 2:30 p.m. on February 3rd, and the finished product was successfully rolled out ten minutes later. After strict inspection by the inspection station and Soviet experts, it was proved that the first one was a first-class product. (He Xuechun)

    鞍钢试轧四十号工字钢成功
    鞍钢大型轧钢厂和初轧厂协作，在二月三日试轧新产品——四十号工字钢成功。这是我国轧钢事业的又一成就。这种大工字钢是修建大厂房和大桥梁等高大结构所必需的材料，按照大型轧钢厂的设计能力是不能轧制这种大工字钢的，但在苏联专家亲自帮助下，改造了初轧厂初轧机的孔型，由初轧厂试轧了大断面的异形钢坯，这就等于在大型轧钢机前增设了一架开坯机。苏联专家并亲自做好四十号工字钢的孔型设计，大型厂轧钢工段准备了大直径的全新锯片，在试轧前并进行了轧辊和导卫板的预安装工作。二月三日下午两点半钟开始试轧，十分钟后就顺利轧出了成品，经检查站和苏联专家的严格检查，证明第一根就是一级品。（何学纯）
