Let's Cherish the Precious Timber More
    Bao Chao
    Since 1952, a large amount of timber has been piling up in the forest areas of Inner Mongolia. By the end of December 1954, the total inventory had reached over 660,000 cubic meters. This includes many important materials such as special electrical poles, general electrical poles, mine props, general lumber, special pilings, general pilings, and railroad ties. Because this timber has been stockpiled for so long, it is now all infested with insects. As many as 350 insects have been found in a single 16-meter-long piling. In eastern Inner Mongolia, ordinary timber is valued at 800,000 yuan per cubic meter. At this price, the 660,000 cubic meters of timber represent a massive stockpile of 520 billion yuan for the state.

    The insect-infested timber must be re-sized and its quality grade lowered before it can be sold. In 1954, the Inner Mongolia forest area lowered the specifications and quality of timber for this reason, causing the state to lose more than 40 billion yuan. If all the insect-infested timber were to be processed, it would result in a loss of more than 110 billion yuan. The workers are very angry and say, "We worked hard all year, only to feed the timber to the bugs!"

    Why has so much timber been stockpiled for so long in the Inner Mongolia forest area? There are two main reasons. One is that the Inner Mongolia Forestry Industry Bureau does not produce according to timber type plans. For example, the railroad ties that the railway department particularly needs were only 60 percent of the planned amount in 1954; while other less-needed timber was over-fulfilled. At the same time, the timber is poorly stored. Some timber is placed on the ground with tall weeds growing over it, in some cases completely covering the timber, causing widespread insect infestation, making it even more difficult to sell. Another reason for the timber stockpile is that the Ministry of Forestry does not actively allocate the timber, nor does it promptly distribute the timber to the units that need it; moreover, it has not paid enough attention to this serious stockpile phenomenon and has not taken effective measures to solve it. In addition, the insufficient number of vehicles allocated by the railway department is also a reason for the timber stockpile, but this is not the main reason.

    The 660,000 cubic meters of timber are still stockpiled, continuing to be corroded by insects. (Attached image)

    多多爱惜宝贵的木材吧
    鲍朝
    内蒙古林区从一九五二年以来就陆续积压大批木材，到一九五四年十二月底，共积压了六十六万多立方公尺。里面有特殊电柱、一般电柱、矿柱、一般用材、特殊桩木、一般桩木和枕木等许多重要的材料。这些木材由于积压日久，已经全部生虫，从一根十六公尺长的桩木里就曾找出三百五十个虫子。内蒙古东部普通木材每立方公尺价值八十万元，按这个价格计算，这六十六万多立方公尺的木材使国家积压了五千二百多亿元的巨款。
    这些生了虫子的木材，必须改变尺寸，降低质量等级，才能卖出去。一九五四年内蒙古林区因为这个原因降低木材的规格质量，使国家损失了四百多亿元。如果把全部生虫的木材都处理完，还要损失一千一百多亿元。职工们都十分气愤，说：“受苦受累忙了一年，结果都喂了虫子！”
    为什么内蒙古林区的木材积压得这么多和这么久呢？原因主要有两个。一个是内蒙古森林工业管理局不按材种计划生产。如铁道部门特别需要的枕木，一九五四年只完成计划的百分之六十；而其他不大需要的木材却超额完成了。同时保管得不好，有的木头就放在地上，野草长得很高，有些都盖没了木头，使木材普遍生了虫子，所以更难推销出去。木材积压的另一个原因是林业部不积极调拨，不及时地把这些木材分配给需用单位；而且对这种严重的积压现象一直不重视，不采取有效措施来解决。此外，铁道部门调拨的车辆不足，也是造成木材积压的原因，但这不是主要的。
    现在这六十六万多立方公尺的木材还在积压着，继续被虫子腐蚀着。（附图片）
