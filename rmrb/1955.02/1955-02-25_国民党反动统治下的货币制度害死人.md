The currency system under the Kuomintang reactionary rule was a feudal and comprador-like plunderous currency system. This currency system was manipulated by imperialism and used by the Kuomintang reactionary ruling clique as a tool to wage anti-people wars and plunder the wealth of the people. It contributed to the bankruptcy of China's national economy; it was a disaster for the Chinese people.

The currency system of New China is fundamentally different from that of old China. It is a currency system characterized by independence, unification, and stability; it is a tool used by the People's Government to build socialism and seek welfare for the people.

(II)

During the more than twenty years of Kuomintang reactionary rule, the Kuomintang reactionaries never stopped their anti-people wars for a single day. Even during the War of Resistance Against Japan, they did not stop. Years of war caused huge fiscal deficits, leading to the indiscriminate issuance of paper money, inflation, stagnation of production, and the continuous deterioration of the people's living conditions.

When the Kuomintang reactionaries implemented the "Legal Tender Reform" in November 1935, which marked the complete loss of China's monetary independence and sovereignty, the signs of inflation were not yet obvious, but from the "Legal Tender Reform" to the eve of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the amount of issuance still increased by two times. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the amount of "Legal Tender" issued increased rapidly. If June 1937 is taken as the base period, the amount of "Legal Tender" issued increased nearly three hundred times by June 1945.

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang reactionaries, with the support of American imperialism, launched a full-scale offensive against the liberated areas. To carry out such a large-scale anti-people war, they had to increase the issuance of paper money even more. From June 1945 to August 1948, the "Legal Tender" was increased by more than fifteen hundred times.

As a result of the massive issuance, the Legal Tender depreciated sharply. By August 1948, the purchasing power of the Legal Tender had fallen to 0.0000002 of its pre-war value. The small value of the currency became an obstacle to further issuance. At that time, large denominations counted in the millions not only made circulation difficult, but the revenue from issuing banknotes could not even offset the printing costs. In order to further implement inflation as a desperate struggle, the Kuomintang reactionaries issued "Gold Yuan Certificates" in August 1948, abandoning the "Legal Tender."

In the face of the deepening political, economic, and military crises of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, the Gold Yuan Certificate could not save its life either. According to the ledger figures of the puppet Central Bank, by May 1949, the Gold Yuan Certificate had been issued to 697 trillion yuan. Compared with its initial issuance amount, it increased 240,000 times in less than a year. Such rapid issuance made the "Gold Yuan Certificate" quickly become waste paper. When the Kuomintang reactionaries announced that they would redeem "Gold Yuan Certificates" with silver dollars, the value of the "Gold Yuan Certificate" had depreciated to 0.000000001 of its original value at the time of issuance.

From the beginning of the War of Resistance Against Japan to the collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, the total currency issuance increased by 176.8 billion times in twelve years; and prices, taking Shanghai as an example, rose to 138.842 billion times. Severe inflation contributed to the collapse of the entire national economy.

The Kuomintang reactionaries implemented a sinful policy of hyperinflation, plundering hundreds of millions of wealth from the people. First of all, each of its "currency reforms" was a large-scale robbery of the people. The "Legal Tender Reform" declared that "all silver dollar holders should immediately deposit them with the government"; the issuance of "Gold Yuan Certificates" declared that "people are prohibited from holding gold, silver, and foreign currencies." But whether it was "should be deposited with the government immediately" or "people are prohibited from holding" gold, silver, and foreign currencies, in essence, it was just to put the people's gold and silver wealth into the pockets of the Kuomintang reactionaries through "currency reform." The issuance of "Gold Yuan Certificates" and the abandonment of "Legal Tender" in 1948 plundered the people's gold, silver, and foreign exchange worth more than 200 million US dollars.

The Kuomintang reactionaries not only plundered the people's gold and silver wealth, but more importantly, they also relied on the unlimited issuance of paper money to take away incalculable material wealth from the people. The faster the printing press turned, the faster the people's wealth was transferred to the pockets of the four big families. And what was left in the hands of the people was a pile of waste paper. This could not but contribute to the collapse of the national economy and also plunge the lives of the vast majority of the people into extreme poverty and hunger.

In terms of the situation of wage earners, according to the estimates of the Dagongbao at that time, the average monthly salary of university professors with higher incomes before the War of Resistance Against Japan was 350 yuan in the first half of 1937, but by the first half of 1946, the actual income had been reduced to 27.3 yuan. Although the wages were nominally calculated according to the cost of living index at that time, they always lagged behind the rise in prices. Even so, the Kuomintang reactionaries openly and secretly froze the cost of living index.

(III)

Under the correct leadership of the Communist Party of China, thanks to the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the broad masses of the people, the Kuomintang reactionary rule was finally crushed. However, the Kuomintang reactionaries fled to Taiwan under the protection of American imperialism, attempting to restore their rule, and continued to carry out political and economic oppression and exploitation of the Taiwanese people.

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang reactionaries issued the Taiwan dollar in Taiwan. The Taiwanese people were already impoverished under the rule of Japanese imperialism, but the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique carried out more vicious plunder in Taiwan than Japanese imperialism. The rapid increase in the issuance of the Taiwan dollar is a clear proof of this cruel plunder. The initial issuance of the Taiwan dollar was 3.5 billion yuan, but by June 1949, it had increased to 8,000 to 10,000 billion yuan. If we compare it with the issuance of 1.6 billion yuan of the Taiwan dollar during the rule of Japanese imperialism, the latter is obviously insignificant.

The massive issuance of the Taiwan dollar caused prices to rise rapidly. If we take Taiwan's prices in 1945 as the base period, by March 1949, they had risen to 1,276.5 times.

In June 1949, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique implemented a "currency reform" in Taiwan and issued the "New Taiwan dollar." At the same time, it claimed that the issuance of the "New Taiwan dollar" would not exceed 200 million yuan.

However, this reform was essentially for a more brutal plunder of the Taiwanese people in order to maintain its remnants. More than 80% of the Kuomintang traitorous clique's annual budget expenditure was used for military expenditures. Although the Chiang bandits have increasingly intensified the collection of exorbitant taxes (according to Chiang bandit newspapers, Taiwan's tax revenue in 1953 was more than 1.98 billion yuan, about 36 times the tax revenue in 1949), such huge military expenditures could not but create huge fiscal deficits. According to their own announcement, the budget deficit for 1954-55 was about 50 million US dollars. The deficit was made up primarily by "US aid" in exchange for selling out Taiwan, our motherland. In 1951, "US aid" accounted for 56% of its actual total expenditure; in 1952, it accounted for 66%; and in 1953, it accounted for 65%. In addition to "US aid," the deficit could only be solved by cruelly depriving the people of their paper money.

By last June, the pseudo-Taiwan Bank announced that the issuance of the New Taiwan dollar had reached more than 960 million yuan, an increase of 17 times compared to the initial issuance. And prices, according to the Chiang bandit "official" announcement, had risen from 100 in December 1949 to 572.3 in June 1954, an increase of nearly 5 times. These figures are obviously greatly embellished. Based on the following unsystematic, obviously lowered figures alone, we can see that the actual situation is much more serious. If we take the prices in June 1949 as 100, then it was 275 at the end of 1950; 350 in May 1951; 480 at the end of the same year; and 527 in February 1952. That is, it had already risen more than four times in less than three years. And the price of rice, the staple food of the Taiwanese people, rose four times from the end of 1952 in the spring and summer of 1953. In addition, the price of chemical fertilizers imported from the United States (Taiwan's agricultural production is very much in need of chemical fertilizers) rose tenfold from June 1949 to June 1953. At the end of last year, there was another big surge in grain prices. Rice rose by about 14% from November 20 to December 9; flour rose by 30% from November 20 to December 9.

Under inflation, the people's lives are naturally extremely difficult. According to the Chiang bandit gang's "official" confession, the number of poor people in Taipei City alone who needed relief had increased to one-tenth of the city's total population by July 1954.

The fascist terror and persecution of the Chiang bandits, coupled with the threat of hunger brought about by the pseudo-currency system and hyperinflation, are causing the Taiwanese people to live a dark and hopeless life that the vast majority of the people on the mainland have long since escaped.

(IV)

The victory of the People's Liberation War and the People's Revolution ended the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and established a people's democratic dictatorship. Those shameful and backward conditions in currency circulation have also quickly become historical relics, and we have established a currency system characterized by independence, unification, and stability. The issuance of the new Renminbi further marks the increasing consolidation and perfection of our country's currency system. This is the pride of the Chinese people, and it is a weapon for the Chinese people to strive for a better future. But the Taiwanese people are still living a miserable life under the ravages of American imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. This requires us to take practical actions to do a good job in issuing new currency, support national construction, support the struggle to liberate Taiwan, and enable the Taiwanese people to be liberated at an early date.

    国民党反动统治下的货币制度害死人
    黄达
    （一）
    国民党反动统治下的货币制度是封建掠夺性与买办掠夺性的货币制度。这个货币制度为帝国主义所操纵并为国民党反动统治集团用来进行反人民战争和掠夺人民财富的工具。它促使中国国民经济破产；它是中国人民的灾难。
    新中国的货币制度和旧中国的货币制度根本不同。它是以独立、统一与稳定为特征的货币制度；它是人民政府用以建设社会主义和为人民谋取福利的工具。（二）
    在国民党反动统治的二十多年中，国民党反动派没有一天停止过反人民的战争。即使在抗日战争期间，也同样没有停止过。连年战争，造成了财政上的大量赤字，从而滥发纸币，通货膨胀，生产陷于停顿，人民生活条件日益恶化。
    当一九三五年十一月国民党反动派实行了标志着我国货币制度自主独立主权全部丧失的“法币改革”时，通货膨胀的征象，还不明显，但从“法币改革”到抗日战争的前夕，发行额还是增长了两倍。到抗日战争期间，“法币”发行额迅速增加起来，“法币”发行额如以一九三七年六月为基期，到一九四五年六月增长了将及三百倍。
    抗日战争胜利以后，国民党反动派在美帝国主义的支援下，向解放区发动了全面的进攻。要进行这样大规模的反人民战争，就不能不更加大量地增发纸币。从一九四五年六月到一九四八年八月“法币”就增发到一千五百多倍。
    大量发行的结果，法币急骤地贬值，一九四八年八月法币购买力已跌为战前币值的○·○○○○○○二。币值的微小已成为再行增发的障碍，当时以百万计的大钞不仅使流通困难，而发钞的收入甚而不能抵补印刷费。为了进一步实行通货膨胀以作垂死挣扎，国民党反动派在一九四八年八月发行了
  “金圆券”，废弃了“法币”。
    在国民党反动统治的政治的、经济的、军事的危机日益加深的情况下，金圆券也挽救不了它的生命。根据伪中央银行的帐面数字来看，金圆券到一九四九年五月已发行到六十九万七千亿元，如果和它最初的发行额比较，不到一年间就增长了二十四万倍。这样急骤的发行使得“金圆券”很快地变成了废纸。当国民党反动派宣布用银圆收兑“金圆券”的时候，“金圆券”的币值已贬低为发行时的原值的○·○○○○○○○○一。
    从抗日战争开始到国民党反动统治崩溃的十二年间，货币发行总共增加了一、七六八亿倍；而物价，以上海为例，上涨到一三八、八四二亿倍。严重的通货膨胀促成整个国民经济的崩溃。
    国民党反动派实行罪恶的恶性通货膨胀政策，从人民身上搜括了亿万财富。首先它的每一次“货币改革”就是对人民进行一次大规模的劫夺。“法币改革”时宣布了“所有银元持有人，应即将其缴存政府”；改发“金圆券”时则宣布了“禁止人民持有金、银和外币。”但不论是“应即缴存政府”，或者是“禁止人民持有”金、银和外币，实质上都不过是通过“货币改革”把人民的金银财富揣进国民党反动派的腰包。一九四八年发行“金圆券”、废弃“法币”，就搜刮了人民的黄金、白银和外汇值二亿美元以上。
    国民党反动派不仅掠夺了人民的金银财富，更重要的是他们还依靠纸币的无限发行从人民手中夺走了难以计算的物质财富。印刷机转动的越迅速，人民的财富就越迅速的转入四大家族的口袋中去。而人民手中剩下的则是一堆废纸。这样，就不能不促使国民经济的崩溃，并且也使广大人民的生活陷于极端贫困与饥饿的境地。
    以工薪人员的状况来说，根据当时大公报的估计，抗日战争前收入较高的大学教授在一九三七年上半年每月薪金平均是三五○元，而到一九四六年上半年实际收入已降低到二七·三元。当时工薪在名义上虽然是按生活费指数计算，但总是赶不上物价的上涨，即使如此，国民党反动派还公开地、隐蔽地冻结生活费指数。
        （三）
    在中国共产党正确领导下，由于中国人民解放军和广大人民的英勇斗争，国民党反动统治终于被粉碎了。但国民党反动派在美帝国主义庇护下逃亡台湾，企图复辟，并对台湾人民继续进行着政治的、经济的压迫与剥削。
    抗日战争胜利后国民党反动派在台湾发行了台币。台湾人民在日本帝国主义统治之下已经穷困不堪，但是蒋介石卖国集团在台湾进行了较日本帝国主义更为凶恶的掠夺。台币发行急骤的增长就是这种残酷掠夺的明证。台币最初的发行额是三十五亿元，到一九四九年六月就增长到八千至一万亿元。如果把日本帝国主义统治时台币十六亿元的发行额拿来比较，后者显然是小巫见大巫了。
    台币大量发行，引起物价飞速上涨。如果以一九四五年台湾的物价为基期，到一九四九年三月就上涨到一、二七六·五倍。
    一九四九年六月蒋介石卖国集团在台湾实行了
  “币制改革”，发行了“新台币”。同时声称“新台币”发行额不超过两亿元。
    但是这种改革实质上是为了对台湾人民更加残暴的掠夺，以维持其残兵败将。国民党卖国集团每年预算支出中有百分之八十以上是用于军费开支。虽然蒋匪帮日益加紧了苛捐杂税的搜刮（据蒋匪报纸透露，台湾一九五三年的税收为十九亿八千多万元，约为一九四九年税收的三十六倍），但是偌大的军事支出不能不造成财政上的大量赤字。据他们自己宣布一九五四——五五年度的预算赤字约达五千万美元。赤字的弥补首先靠以出卖祖国的台湾所换来的“美援”。一九五一年其实际总支出中“美援”占百分之五十六；一九五二年占百分之六十六；一九五三年占百分之六十五。除去“美援”之外，赤字当然就只有靠残酷剥夺人民的纸币发行来解决。
    到去年六月，伪台湾银行宣布新台币的发行额已达九亿六千多万元，比最初发行额增加了十七倍。而物价，根据蒋匪“官”方公布，已从一九四九年十二月的一百上涨到一九五四年六月的五七二·三，即上涨了将及五倍。这些数字显然都是大大粉饰过的。仅根据下面一些不系统的、显然是压低了的数字就可以看出实际情况要严重的多。如果以一九四九年六月的物价为一百，那么，一九五○年底是二七五；一九五一年五月为三五○；同年底为四八○；一九五二年二月为五二七。即不到三年间已经上涨了四倍多。而一九五三年春夏之交台湾人民的主食——大米的价格较一九五二年底就上涨四倍。此外美国输入的化学肥料（台湾的农业生产是很需要化学肥料的）从一九四九年六月到一九五三年六月上涨十倍。去年年底又发生了粮食的大涨风。米从十一月二十日到十二月九日上涨了约百分之十四；面粉从十一月二十日到十二月九日就上涨了百分之三十。
    通货膨胀下人民生活自然是极端困难的。根据蒋匪帮“官”方供认，仅台北一市需要救济的贫民，一九五四年七月已增到占台北市全市人口的十分之一。
    蒋匪法西斯的恐怖镇压和迫害，再加以伪币制度和恶性通货膨胀所带来的饥饿威胁，台湾人民正过着大陆上广大人民所久已摆脱了的暗无天日的生活。
        （四）
    人民解放战争和人民革命的胜利结束了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治并建立起人民民主专政的政权。货币流通中的那些耻辱和落后状况也迅速地变成历史的陈迹，我们已建立了以独立、统一和稳定为特征的货币制度。而新的人民币的发行，更标志着我国货币制度的日益巩固和完善。这是中国人民的骄傲，它是中国人民争取美好将来的武器。但台湾人民今天还在美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石卖国集团的蹂躏下过着悲惨的日子，这就需要我们用实际行动来做好发行新币的工作，支持国家建设，支援解放台湾的斗争，使台湾人民早日获得解放。
