    Sign My Name
    Qi Baishi, Chairman of the Chinese Artists Association
    I heard about the American atomic bomb a few years ago, and they bragged that it could destroy a city in a minute. I thought it was strange. If they invented a bomb that could build a city in a minute, that would be something to congratulate them on. The United States is doing such terrible things, losing all conscience, in order to invade. Since the beginning of time, there has never been such a crime! And they still boast and bluff, truly shameless.
    Now, after a few years, the United States is still using the atomic bomb to threaten peace. But I also heard that the Soviet Union is using atomic energy for peaceful construction. I am ninety-five years old this year, and I am fortunate to have lived to see liberation, to see Chairman Mao, to see the Chinese people having good years, and to see the country begin to be at peace. I think that with atomic energy, many good things will be invented in the future, for our children and grandchildren to enjoy endlessly!
    I have been painting for sixty or seventy years. I paint beautiful things, things full of life. I want every insect I paint to be full of vitality. Who can tolerate the destruction of a beautiful world!
    In the past five years, many foreign friends from all over the world have come to visit me in Beijing. I can't remember the names of all these good people. But I know they come for peace and for art!
    I think all the elderly people in the world love peace, love quiet, love their homes and their children and grandchildren; to love peace is to defend peace, and to defend peace is to oppose the use of ominous things – atomic bombs! So I want to respond to the call of the World Peace Council and sign my name on the appeal to the people of the world: Qi Baishi.

    签上我的名字
    中国美术家协会主席　齐白石
    早几年就听说美国有原子弹，还吹牛说，一分钟就能炸毁一座城市，我就觉得很奇怪，要是发明一个什么弹能在一分钟内造好一座城市，那才值得恭维哩。美国为了侵略，才丧尽天良，做这种大坏事。自从盘古开天地，还找不出类此的罪恶！他还吹牛唬人，真是恬不知耻。
    如今过了几年，美国还是用原子弹威胁和平。可是我又听说苏联把原子能用在和平建设上。我今年九十五岁，幸喜能活到解放，看见毛主席，看见中国人过好年头，看见国家开始太平。我想有了原子能，将来一定还要发明许多好东西，供我们子孙万代享用不尽！
    我画了六、七十年画，我画好看的东西，画有生气的东西，我画一个草虫都愿它生机活泼，谁又能容忍美好世界遭到破坏！
    五年以来，许多从世界各地到北京来的外国朋友都来看望我，我记不得这许多好人的名字。但是我知道他们是为和平为艺术而来的！
    我想全世界的老年人都爱和平，爱安静，爱自己的家园和子孙；爱和平就要保卫和平，保卫和平就要反对使用不祥之物——原子弹！所以我要响应世界和平理事会的号召，在告全世界人民书上签上我的名字：齐白石。
