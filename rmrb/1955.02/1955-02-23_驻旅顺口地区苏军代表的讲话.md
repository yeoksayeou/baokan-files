Comrades:

    Allow me, on behalf of all Soviet soldiers and their families, to pay respects to the Delegation of the People’s Republic of China headed by Comrade Peng Dehuai, and through them, to the great, freedom-loving Chinese people and the Government of the People’s Republic of China.

    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union educates the Soviet people in the spirit of internationalism and in the spirit of respect for the working people of all countries.

    The close friendship between the Soviet Union and China is an example of sincere relations filled with mutual love and respect, and filled with the spirit of internationalism.

    We are extremely pleased to feel that our fraternal friendship is becoming warmer and closer.

    The visit of the Delegation of the People’s Republic of China to participate in the celebration of the 37th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army is another vivid demonstration of the high esteem of the Chinese working people for the Soviet people and their armed forces.

    Dear comrades, we sincerely thank you for your condolences and your kind congratulations to the great Soviet people and their army.

    Dear friends, before the Great Patriotic War, our country and army were isolated in the face of the capitalist world. However, on our side, there was sympathy and support from millions of working people in all countries. Therefore, we achieved victory. The Soviet army gloriously held high its battle flag, withstood the most severe tests, and our army defeated the bandit armies of Hitler's Germany and imperialist Japan, thereby liberating the working people of many countries in Europe and Asia and granting them national independence.

    Now the Soviet Union is no longer isolated. Advancing alongside it are the great Chinese people and their heroic People's Liberation Army, and the people of all countries in the democratic camp.

    The great friendship and cooperation between the Soviet Union and China, with a population of more than 800 million, plays a decisive role in consolidating the strength of democracy and socialism.

    The increasingly consolidated friendship and fraternal mutual assistance between the Soviet Union and China plays a major role in the economic development of our two countries and the further improvement of the people's well-being. The Soviet people are pleased to see that People's China is growing and its strength is increasing.

    The people of all ethnic groups in China were able to achieve these achievements only after the long-tested and wise Chinese Communist Party led the country.

    Dear friends, according to the decision of our two governments, we will soon leave your hospitable country. The Lushunkou Naval Base and all the equipment in this area will be handed over to the full control of the People's Republic of China.

    As we leave here, we know that the defense of Lushunkou will be transferred to reliable hands. The beloved sons of the Chinese people - the heroic People's Liberation Army - have more than once shown the world that they are capable of defending the honor and independence of their motherland.

    On the occasion of celebrating this festival, I would like to take this opportunity to express my best wishes and congratulations to our comrades-in-arms - the officers and soldiers of the glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army.

    May the great and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and China continue to develop and consolidate!

    Glory to the pioneers who are fighting for the peace and security of the people of all countries - the great people of the Soviet Union and China!

    驻旅顺口地区苏军代表的讲话亲爱的同志们：
    请允许我代表全体苏联军人和他们的家属向以彭德怀同志为首的中华人民共和国代表团，并通过他们向伟大的、爱好自由的中国人民和中华人民共和国政府致敬。
    苏联共产党以国际主义的精神、以尊敬各国劳动人民的精神教育着苏联人民。
    苏中紧密的友谊就是充满相互友爱和尊敬、充满国际主义精神的真诚关系的榜样。
    我们极其愉快地感到我们这种兄弟般的友谊是愈来愈热烈，愈来愈亲密。
    中华人民共和国代表团前来参加苏联建军三十七周年纪念，又一次生动地证明了中国劳动人民对苏联人民和它的武装力量怀着崇高的敬意。
    亲爱的同志们，我们衷心地感谢你们的慰问和你们对伟大的苏联人民和它的军队所表示的亲切祝贺。
    亲爱的朋友们，在伟大的卫国战争以前，我们的国家和军队在资本主义世界面前是处在孤立的地位。但是，在我们这方面却有着世界各国千百万劳动者的同情和支持。因此我们就取得了胜利。苏联军队光荣地高举着自己的战斗旗帜，经受了最严重的考验，我们的军队击溃了希特勒德国和帝国主义日本的匪军，从而使欧洲和亚洲许多国家的劳动人民获得了自由和民族独立。
    现在苏联已经不再是孤立的了。同它并肩前进的，有伟大的中国人民和它的英勇的人民解放军，有民主阵营的各国人民。
    拥有八亿以上人口的苏中两国人民的伟大友谊和合作，对于巩固民主和社会主义的力量，起着决定性的作用。
    苏中两国日益巩固的友谊和兄弟般的互助，对于我们两国经济发展和进一步提高人民的福利，起着重大的作用。苏联人民愉快地看到：人民中国正在成长，它的力量日益加强。
    中国各族人民是在久经考验的英明的中国共产党领导了国家以后才有可能获得这些成就。
    亲爱的朋友们，根据我们两国政府的决定，我们在最近期内即将离开你们这个好客的国家。旅顺口海军根据地和这个地区的全部设备将交由中华人民共和国完全支配。
    在离开这里的时候，我们知道，旅顺口的防卫是会转到可靠者的手里。中国人民亲爱的子弟——英勇的人民解放军曾经不止一次地向全世界表明了：他们是有能力保卫自己祖国的荣誉和独立的。
    在庆祝这个节日的时候，我借此机会，向我们的战友——光荣的中国人民解放军的将士们，表示最好的愿望和祝贺。
    愿伟大的、牢不可破的苏中友谊日益发展和巩固！
    光荣归于为争取各国人民和平和安全而斗争的先锋队——苏中两国伟大的人民！
