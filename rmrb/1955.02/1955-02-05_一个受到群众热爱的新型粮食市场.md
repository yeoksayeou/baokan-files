    A New Type of Grain Market Loved by the Masses
    Liang Ming, Cao Yan
    After completing the state grain unified purchase task in the winter of 1953, the LinYi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the LinYi County People's Government, in accordance with instructions from higher authorities, established a new type of primary grain market under state leadership in LinJin Town, a central market in the county. From its establishment on February 25, 1954, to the end of the year, this market purchased and regulated a total of 2,453,300 jin of various grains. Through the market, 72,626 jin of grain and raw materials were supplied to more than 400 grain-deficient farmers and six small workshops, 589,579 jin of grain varieties were exchanged and adjusted, and 1,791,116 jin of grain were purchased by the state. The masses said that this grain market is "five satisfied": surplus grain households are satisfied with selling grain, grain-deficient households are satisfied with buying grain, everyone is satisfied with adjusting varieties, small workshops are satisfied with obtaining raw materials, and the state is satisfied with purchasing more surplus grain.

    Let the Masses Correctly Understand the State's Grain Policy
    In the winter of 1953, LinYi County implemented the policy of unified purchase and sale of grain by the state, and the old grain merchant market was abolished, and the rural economy once showed signs of stagnation. At this time, grain speculators took the opportunity to conduct black market transactions, buying surplus grain from surplus grain households at low prices and selling it to grain-deficient households at prices 30% to 40% higher than the state listed price. The reason for this phenomenon was that the policy of unified purchase and sale was initially implemented, and the masses' understanding of the significance of unified purchase and sale was still poor, and there were various concerns in their minds: households with surplus grain were afraid of openly selling grain again, fearing that others would say "the unified purchase is not thorough," that selling now after not selling in the past was "falling behind," and that they would be labeled with "capitalist ideas." Grain-deficient households were afraid that the state would not be able to supply grain, so they did not hesitate to suffer losses and buy grain at high prices. The county party committee analyzed this situation at that time and strengthened publicity work to the masses before establishing the market. The county party committee made a report to the county, district, and township cadres, and organized 35 reporters to report to the vast number of cadres and the masses in various townships, explaining the important significance of the state establishing a grain market after the unified purchase, and the nature of the grain market; at the same time, it made it clear to the masses that it was glorious to directly sell grain to the state in the unified purchase, and it was also glorious to sell the surplus grain that they still had in the state grain market after the unified purchase. The county people's government also issued a notice on the establishment of a primary grain market. On the first day of the market's establishment, more than 50 farmers exchanged 5,490 jin of grain. Later, the number of farmers who came to the market to trade gradually increased. In more than 20 days until mid-March, more than 100,000 jin of grain were exchanged.

    After the market became active, the publicity work on the market was strengthened. The market's "transaction staff" were also "publicity staff." They always paid attention to publicizing the state's grain policy and the benefits of establishing this new market. When there were many people at the fair, cadres were also drawn out to conduct publicity at the fair. Two blackboards were set up in the market, which regularly published the unified purchase and sale policy, the state's grain listed prices, answers to questions raised by the masses, market dynamics, and typical introductions of market transactions. Jing Baoan, a farmer from Jingjia Village, was originally a surplus grain household. During the unified purchase, he concealed that he was a grain-deficient household and also received a grain supply certificate. The grain he had left over was soybeans, and the purpose of reporting as a grain-deficient household was to have the state supply some other grains. On March 9th, he went to the fair and passed by the grain market. He saw a group of people buying and selling grain, and he heard the market cadres saying that varieties could be exchanged in this market. The next day after returning home, he took 470 jin of white beans from his home and exchanged them for millet and corn suitable for his needs, and also sold 200 jin to the state. After returning to the village, he immediately returned the grain supply certificate issued to him to the township government, saying: "With the grain market, it is much more convenient. If I had known this, who would have deceived the government!"

    After the wheat harvest last June, the masses needed to sell surplus grain, but they did not know how the state would conduct the unified purchase. The market cadres and the county party committee conducted research and explained to the masses: Before the state conducts the unified purchase, surplus grain can be sold in the state market. The state market can issue certificates to the masses, which can be used to offset the unified purchase quota during the unified purchase. The market also issued "turnover certificates" to farmers who temporarily needed money to sell their rations, so that they could buy back grain from the market when they needed it. The masses were very satisfied with this, and sold more surplus grain to the state. Many farmers who opened "turnover certificates" had a bumper harvest of grain planted in the autumn. Not only did they not buy grain anymore, but they also sold some grain in the state market.

    Supplied Grain Varieties Suitable for the Needs of the Masses
    The crops planted by farmers in the LinJin Town area are mainly wheat, followed by beans. In the winter of 1953, the state's unified purchase was mainly wheat; many farmers responded to the state's call to replace fine grains with coarse grains, selling wheat to the state and leaving beans to eat. However, local farmers are not used to eating only one kind of bean flour; after the unified purchase, farmers asked to adjust grain varieties. After learning about this requirement of the farmers, the county grain bureau transferred corn, millet, millet and other miscellaneous grains from other places to the masses for exchange when establishing the primary grain market, and everyone was very satisfied. After such adjustments, farmers also sold the surplus and saved grain after selling the surplus grain to the state grain market. Jia Changming, a farmer in ZhuoLi Village, planted mostly beans. His wife needed some other grains when she gave birth to a child, and she was worried that there was no place to exchange them. He heard that the state had established a grain market that could exchange grain, so he exchanged 220 jin of soybeans for corn, rice, and millet at the market. After exchanging the grain, he happily said: "If the state had not controlled the grain, how could we eat the grain that we don't grow here!"

    The market also exchanged grain varieties according to seasonal changes. Last summer harvest, the weather was hot, and the masses needed to use millet, mung beans, and cowpeas to cook soup, so the market added these varieties. The state market also exchanged special grains to the masses according to their special needs, such as some patients who needed glutinous rice, which could also be exchanged in this market; when the masses wanted to plant beans to suppress green manure in the summer, the market supplied more than 100,000 jin of beans obtained from exchange to farmers as seeds.

    Excellent Style of Serving the Masses Enthusiastically
    Jing Mingqing, the director of the LinJin Town Grain Market, is a Communist Party member, and Li Guoshun, the transaction staff, is a member of the Communist Youth League. In addition, there are three other comrades; their work attitudes are very good. After studying the party's general line, they realized the importance of grain work. Therefore, they are willing to actively study in market work and strive to facilitate the people. Initially, the market was located in a remote temple courtyard, which was not very convenient for the masses; later, they moved to a square in the center of the fair. There were no houses to live in this venue, so they set up tents and lived for a summer. They actively assisted in solving any difficulties that the villagers encountered when they came to the market to trade. The inspection of the quality of the masses' grain and the determination of the grade were also fair and reasonable. Last July, Wang Yanlin, a 69-year-old man from LiuShang Village, transported a large cart of wheat to this market for sale. Jing Mingqing and Li Guoshun helped the old man unload the grain from the cart and also helped him carry the grain bags. One of the pockets was broken and the grain leaked on the ground. Li Guoshun helped the old man sweep up the grain, sifted the soil, poured it into the pocket, and sewed up the broken part of the pocket. The old man said with emotion: "I have lived this life and often went to the market to buy and sell grain. The unscrupulous merchants I met before always teased people, using large measures to buy and small measures to sell, buying cheap and selling expensive; now the market managed by the state is really good!"

    In summer, the weather is hot, and many villagers come to the market to trade, so the market management cadres set up sheds in the market and boiled water. They understand the living habits of the farmers very well and do not mechanically "work on time." The masses can buy and sell grain whenever they come to the market. After the summer harvest last year, there were two to three thousand jin of grain on the market every day. They had few people, so they studied and improved their working methods to achieve "five quicks" (quick entry, quick exit, quick inspection, quick weighing, quick billing). In this way, they can collect more than 20,000 jin of grain a day than in the past.

    一个受到群众热爱的新型粮食市场
    梁明　曹兗
    中共山西省临猗县委会和临猗县人民政府，在一九五三年冬季完成了国家的粮食统购任务后，依据上级的指示，在全县的一个中心集市——临晋镇建立了国家领导的新型初级粮食市场。这个市场自一九五四年二月二十五日建立，到年底为止，共收购调剂了各种粮食二百四十五万三千三百多斤。通过市场供应给缺粮农民四百余户和六家小型作坊的粮食和原料七万二千六百二十六斤，互通有无调剂粮食品种五十八万九千五百七十九斤，由国家收购的粮食一百七十九万一千一百一十六斤。群众说这个粮食市场是“五满意”：余粮户卖了粮满意，缺粮户买到粮满意，调剂品种大家满意，小型作坊得到原料满意，国家多收购了余粮满意。
    让群众正确地了解国家的粮食政策
    一九五三年冬季，临猗县实行了粮食统购统销政策，取缔了旧的粮商市场，农村经济一度呈现出死滞现象。这时，粮食投机商乘机进行黑市交易，用低价收买余粮户的粮食，以高出国家牌价百分之三四十的高价卖给缺粮户。形成这种现象的原因是统购统销政策初实行，群众对统购统销的意义认识的还差，思想上还有种种顾虑：有余粮的户怕再公开出卖粮食，别人说“统购不彻底”，过去不卖现在卖已“落了后”，还怕戴“资本主义思想”帽子。缺粮户怕国家供应不上粮食，也就不惜吃亏用高价买粮。县委当时分析了这种情况，在建立市场前，就加强了对群众的宣传工作。县委对县区乡干部作了报告，并组织了三十五个报告员到各乡向广大干部群众作了报告，讲解了国家在统购以后建立粮食市场的重要意义，和粮食市场的性质；同时向群众讲明统购中把粮食直接出卖给国家是光荣的，统购后把自己仍然多余的一部余粮拿到国家的粮食市场出卖也是光荣的。县人民政府还出了建立初级粮食市场的布告。市场初建的那一天，就有五十多个农民交换了粮食五千四百九十斤。以后，来市场进行交易的农民陆续增加。到三月中旬共二十多天时间，就互相调剂了粮食十余万斤。
    市场活跃以后，又加强了市场上的宣传工作。市场的“交易员”也是“宣传员”。他们随时都注意宣传国家的粮食政策和建立这种新市场的好处。逢集会人多时，还抽出干部在集会上进行宣传。市场内设立了两块黑板报，经常登载统购统销政策、国家粮食牌价、对群众提出的问题的解答、市场动态及市场交易的典型介绍。景家庄农民景保安本来是个余粮户，在统购中隐瞒为缺粮户，还领了粮食供应证。他家余的粮食是豆子，报缺粮户的目的是想叫国家供应些其它粮食。三月九日他去赶集，路过粮食市场，见一堆一伙的人在买卖粮食，他听到市场干部在讲可以在这市场上互换品种。回家后第二天，就从家里拿了四百七十斤白豆，到这市场上换了适合需用的小米、玉米，还卖给国家二百斤。他回村后马上把发给他的粮食供应证退给乡政府，说：“有了粮食市场可方便得多啦，早知是这样，谁还欺骗政府！”
    去年六月小麦收割以后，群众需要出卖余粮，可是不知道国家怎样统购。市场干部和县委进行了研究，向群众说明：国家没有统购以前，余粮可以到国家市场出售，国家市场上可以给群众开证明条子，到统购时可以顶统购数。市场还给暂时需用钱而要出卖口粮的农民开了“周转证明”，到需要粮食时就可以从市场买回粮食。这样做，群众很满意，更多地卖余粮给国家。有许多开“周转证明”的农民秋后种的粮食丰收了，不但不再买粮食，还又在国家市场上卖了些粮食。
    供应了适合群众需要的粮食品种
    临晋镇一带的农民种植的作物主要是小麦，其次是豆类。一九五三年冬季，国家统购的主要是小麦；许多农民响应国家以粗代细的号召，把小麦卖给国家，留下豆子吃。可是，当地农民不习惯光吃
  一种豆面；统购以后，农民就要求调剂粮食品种。县粮食局了解了农民这个要求以后，在建立初级粮食市场时就从别处调来玉米、谷子、小米等杂粮让群众调换，大家都很满意。这样调剂后，农民把卖余粮后仍然多余的和节约下来的粮食也卖给国家粮食市场了。卓里村农民贾长命，种的多是豆子。他的妻子生小孩需用些别的粮食，发愁没地方去换。他听到国家建立粮食市场能调换粮食，就用二百二十斤黄豆到市场换了玉米、大米、小米。换到粮食后，高兴地说：“要不是国家掌握了粮食，咱处不种的粮食怎能吃上！”
    市场还根据季节的变化，调换粮食品种。去年夏收时，天气热了，群众需要用小米、绿豆、江豆煮汤，市场就增添了这些品种。国家市场还根据群众的特殊需要换给群众特殊的粮食，如有的病人要江米，也可以在这市场上换到；到夏季群众要种豆子压绿肥，市场就把换来的豆子供应了十多万斤给农民做种籽。
    热心为群众服务的优良作风
    临晋镇粮食市场主任荆明卿是个共产党员，交易员李国顺是个青年团员，另外还有三个同志；他们的工作态度都很好。他们学习了党的总路线以后，认识到了粮食工作的重要性。因此，他们在市场工作上都肯积极钻研，力求与民方便。当初，市场设在一个偏僻的庙院里，对群众不很方便；以后他们就迁移到集市中心的一个广场上。这场上没有房子住，他们就搭起帐棚住了一夏天。来市场上进行交易的老乡有什么困难，他们都积极地协助解决。对群众的粮食质量的检验和等级的确定也都公道合理。去年七月里，留尚村一位六十九岁的老汉王彦林运了一大车小麦到这个市场出卖。荆明卿、李国顺就帮助老汉把粮食卸下车，还帮助他扛粮袋。有一条口袋破了，粮食漏在地下，李国顺就帮老汉把粮食扫了起来，把土簸了，倒在口袋里，还把口袋破的地方缝住。老汉感动地说：“我活了这一辈子，也常到市场买卖粮食，以前遇到的奸商们总是捉弄人哩，大斗入小斗出，买的贱卖的贵；现在国家管的这市场真正好！”
    夏天，天气炎热，到市场进行交易的老乡很多，市场管理干部就在市场上搭起凉棚，烧了开水。他们很了解农民的生活习惯，不机械地“按时办公”，群众随时到市场来都可以买卖粮食。去年夏收后，上市粮食每天有两三万斤。他们人手少，就研究改进工作方法，作到“五快”（进场快，出场快，验质快，过秤快，开票快）。这样一天能比过去多收两万多斤粮食。
