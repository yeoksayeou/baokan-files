Workers from the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory's mechanical, foundry, and forging auxiliary workshops, totaling more than fifty advanced workers, have issued a friendly challenge to railway factories across the country to launch an inter-factory labor emulation campaign for the same type of work and products.

Among the fifty-plus advanced workers who initiated the competition are workers in eight trades, including foundry workers, forge workers, hammer workers, spring workers, lathe operators, milling machine operators, brake workers, and drill press operators. They have established advanced time quotas covering sixty-five types of general-purpose parts for locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars, encompassing forging, casting, and machining. On average, these quotas are about 30 percent higher than the factory's set targets. They have also set specific quality requirements to ensure standards are met. Zhuang Minggeng, a lathe operator who won the "Glorious Railway Worker" medal, proposed that the "oil pump check valve" complete machining, with a factory-set target of three hours and ten minutes, be completed in one hour and thirty minutes; the factory-set target for complete machining of the angle cock valve is forty minutes, while he set it at only twenty-eight minutes. These competition targets were developed after careful study. Once the competition conditions are met, a significant amount of work hours can be saved. Based on the twelve types of workpieces involved in the competition in the forging workshop alone, more than 2,600 workdays can be saved annually. Currently, these advanced workers are launching a technical innovation movement to meet the advanced quotas and ensure the realization of the competition conditions.

    开展厂际同工种同工作物的劳动竞赛
    戚墅堰机厂工人向全国铁路工厂挑战
    戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂机械、翻砂、锻冶三个辅助车间的五十多个先进工人，向全国各铁路工厂提出友谊的挑战，开展厂际同工种同工作物的劳动竞赛。
    发起竞赛的五十多个先进工人中，有翻砂工、锻工、锤工、弹簧工、车工、铣工、闸工、钻床工等八个工种的工人。他们订出了包括六十五种机、客、货车通用配件锻、铸及机械加工的先进工时定额，平均约比厂定指标要高百分之三十。在质量上他们也订出了具体的要求，保证达到标准。荣获“光荣的铁路工作者”奖章的车工庄铭耕提出竞赛的工作物中“油泵逆止阀”全套加工，厂定指标是三小时十分，他订的是一小时三十分；折角塞门加工全套厂定指标是四十分钟，他只订二十八分钟。这些竞赛指标，都是经过慎重研究后制订出来的。竞赛条件实现后，就可节省大量工时，单以锻冶车间参加竞赛的十二种工作物计算，全年可节省人工二千六百多个工作日。目前，这些先进工人正在为达到先进定额而开展技术革新运动，保证竞赛条件的实现。（本报江苏记者站）
