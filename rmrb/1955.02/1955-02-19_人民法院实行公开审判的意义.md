The Constitution of the People's Republic of China stipulates in Article 76: "People's courts hear cases in public, except in special circumstances as prescribed by law." This is an important principle of judicial democratization in our country. Public trial means that when people's courts hear cases, whether they are first instance or second instance cases, the parties concerned must be allowed to appear in court to present their cases and argue; and the public and news reporters are allowed to attend; newspapers can also publish reports on the trial process.

The public trial of cases by the people's courts is determined by the nature of our people's courts and the tasks they undertake. The people's court is an important part of the people's democratic regime, and its fundamental task is to use legal weapons to "suppress reactionaries, protect the people; punish criminals, protect the good," and educate citizens to consciously abide by the law. Implementing public trials is an important guarantee for the smooth completion of the above tasks.

Public trial places the court's trial activities under the supervision of the masses. This enables the people's courts to conduct trials of cases more fairly and reasonably, and to continuously improve their work. When the court tries a case in public, the masses attending the hearing see the process of the judges hearing the case, and thus understand whether the judges' handling of the case is legal and fair. Any member of the public who attends the hearing and finds shortcomings in the judges' judicial style or the court's judicial work can submit criticisms through newspapers, periodicals, or by writing directly to the people's court. At the same time, the attending public can also supervise the procurator-general, witnesses, and appraisers. Therefore, the implementation of the public trial system not only directly facilitates the people's supervision of the work of the courts from below, but also effectively strengthens the sense of responsibility of judges, procurators-general, and relevant witnesses and appraisers, prompting them to conduct trials, investigations, and provide evidence more conscientiously and responsibly, so as to make fair and reasonable judgments and rulings.

Public trials can exert the educational role of the people's courts for the people. One of the differences between the people's courts of our country and the courts of bourgeois countries is that the people's courts have the task of educating the people to consciously abide by the law. Its trial activities are not only for punishing crimes, but also for preventing crimes. Public trial is the main method for the people's courts to achieve this educational task. Through the public trial of cases, not only can the parties concerned be educated, but also other members of the public can be effectively educated. Because in the courtroom where the people attend the hearing, the court strictly abides by the laws of the country, step by step revealing the whole situation of the crime or civil case, pointing out the causes of the crime or dispute and its dangers, and combining the facts of the case to instill some legal knowledge into the masses. In this way, on the one hand, it can prompt the attending masses to conduct self-examination, be alert to the influence of the bad ideological consciousness left over from the old society, and better abide by the laws of the country; on the other hand, it can also arouse the people's hatred for criminals and their behavior, mobilize them to fight against criminal behavior, thereby cultivating and establishing a moral atmosphere in society to resist crime, so as to prevent the continued occurrence of similar behaviors.

The people's courts not only should but also can conduct public trials, which is also determined by the nature of our people's courts. In our country, the law represents the will of the people, and the people's courts conduct trials of cases on behalf of the greatest interests of the people of the whole country. This kind of trial is in line with truth and justice, and there is nothing to hide. This is the condition for our people's courts to be able to conduct public trials. According to the provisions of our country's Constitution and the Organic Law of the People's Courts, people's courts also hear cases that are not conducted in public. This mainly refers to the following two types of cases: one is cases involving state secrets, and the other is cases involving privacy that have a bad impact on society. The law stipulates that these two types of cases are not to be tried in public, which is based on safeguarding the interests of the country and the people or on respecting the people's democratic rights and the public interest. Therefore, this provision does not conflict with the principle of public trial in the slightest; at the same time, although these cases are not tried in public, they are still pronounced in public, so they can also achieve the effect of educating the people.

Contrary to the people's courts of our country, the courts of bourgeois countries cannot conduct truly democratic public trials. Although their trials of cases are sometimes conducted "publicly," they actually do not play an educational role among the oppressed working masses. This is because the courts and laws of bourgeois countries all serve the interests of a few ruling classes and are tools for exercising autocratic oppression over the working people. Therefore, the courts and laws of bourgeois countries only have a threatening effect, not a persuasive effect. Especially for the working people, the laws and trials of bourgeois countries not only cannot achieve the effect of education, but also arouse the people's hatred for the courts and arouse the people's resistance. In this case, the courts of bourgeois countries often openly refuse the working people to attend court hearings. If it is said that before capitalism entered the stage of imperialism, bourgeois countries tried their best to maintain the democratic form of open litigation in appearance, then after capitalism entered the stage of imperialism and entered the period of military fascist dictatorship, in order not to expose the dark secrets of the reactionary ruling group, especially to cover up its persecution of peace and democracy activists, the bourgeoisie has become increasingly concerned about the principle of open litigation, and even does not hesitate to use all kinds of crude means to destroy it. The "trial" of the leaders of the American Communist Party by the American bourgeoisie's court in 1949 is a most typical example. When hearing this illegally fabricated case, only a courtroom that could only accommodate less than a hundred people was opened, and the people who attended the hearing were all secret agents, agents of the police, or selected representatives of the bourgeoisie. Many secret agents and a large police force were also deployed around the court to protect their despicable "trial."

In socialist countries and people's democratic countries, it is possible to truly implement revolutionary legality. Public trial is one of the important symbols of revolutionary legality. In the past, the people's courts at all levels in our country have implemented public trials, and for some typical cases with social educational significance, they have also specially selected the most convenient locations and times for the public to participate in order to widely attract the masses to attend the hearings. Public trials have had the effect of educating the masses in the past, and have gained certain experience. However, it must also be pointed out that at present, court cadres in various places still have some deviations in their understanding of the application of this democratic legal system of public trial. For example, some cadres believe that public trial means holding "public trial conferences" in a big way, and do not know that daily trials should always allow and welcome the public to attend (for some cases with social educational significance, more people should be consciously attracted to participate, but the kind of "public trial" form that mixes court trials and mass accusations should not be adopted). Some cadres believe that public trial can be replaced by public pronouncements, and therefore are only satisfied with holding pronouncement conferences, and do not conduct public trials according to the trial procedures. This is because they do not understand that in addition to the educational role, public trial also embodies democracy in the trial, and a simple public pronouncement cannot replace a public trial. Some cadres also regard public trial as a purely democratic form, while ignoring its inherent democratic content and essence, which is also wrong. It should be recognized that the trial activity of public trial is an important process of investigating and studying cases. The judgment of the case should mainly be based on the facts investigated by the trial court. Therefore, in the trial of the case, the trial personnel must be realistic and must allow everyone related to the case to speak as much as possible. All relevant issues they raise should be carefully listened to and carefully investigated and studied. Only by earnestly promoting democracy and uniting the democratic form of public trial with its democratic essence can we easily find out the truth of the case, make correct judgments, and effectively educate the masses.

Public trial is an important principle of judicial democratization stipulated by our country's Constitution. Its political significance is very important. At the same time, it is also the basic link for the people's courts to establish and implement various democratization systems such as jury, collegial panel, recusal, and defense. The people's courts at all levels should conscientiously study and earnestly implement this system to fully exert its practical role.

    人民法院实行公开审判的意义
    司宣
    中华人民共和国宪法第七十六条规定：“人民法院审理案件，除法律规定的特别情况外，一律公开进行。”这是我国司法民主化的一个重要原则。公开审判，是指人民法院在审判案件时，不论是第一审或第二审案件，都要让有关当事人到庭申诉和辩论；并容许群众和新闻记者旁听；报社还可发表有关审判过程的报道。
    人民法院公开审理案件，是由我国人民法院的性质及其所担负的任务决定的。人民法院是人民民主政权的重要组成部分，它的根本任务是运用法律武器“镇压反动、保护人民；惩罚犯罪、保护善良”，并教育公民自觉地遵守法律。实行公开审判，对于顺利完成上述任务有着重要的保证作用。
    公开审判是把法院的审判活动置于群众的监督之下。这样就能够使人民法院对案件的审判作到更加公正合理，并不断改进自己的工作。法院在公开审理案件的时候，参加旁听的群众亲眼看见审判员审理案件的过程，从而了解审判员处理案件是否合法，是否公正。任何旁听的群众如果发现审判员的审判作风或法院的审判工作有缺点，都可以通过报纸、刊物或直接给人民法院写信提出批评。同时，旁听的群众对于检察长、证人和鉴定人等也可以给以监督。因此，公开审判制度的实行，不仅直接便利了人民群众由下而上地监督法院的工作，而且也能有效地加强审判员、检察长以及有关的证人和鉴定人等的责任感，促使他们更加认真负责地进行审讯、调查和提供证据，以便作出公平合理的判决和裁定。
    公开审判可以发挥人民法院对于人民群众的教育作用。我国人民法院同资产阶级国家法院的区别之一，就是人民法院负有教育人民自觉地遵守法律的任务，它的审判活动不只是为了惩罚犯罪，而且还要预防犯罪。公开审判就是人民法院实现这种教育任务的主要方法。通过对案件的公开审判，不仅可以教育当事人本人，而且可以有效地教育其他群众。因为在有人民群众参加旁听的审判庭上，法院严格地遵守着国家的法律，一步一步地揭开犯罪或民事案件的全部情况，指出犯罪或纠纷产生的原因及其危险性，再结合案件事实向群众灌输一些法律知识。这样，一方面可以促使旁听的群众作自我检查，警惕旧社会遗留下来的不良思想意识的影响，更好地遵守国家的法律；另一方面也可以引起人民群众对于犯罪者及其行为的憎恨，动员起来同犯罪行为进行斗争，从而在社会上培养和树立起一种抵制犯罪的道德气氛，以防止类似行为的继续发生。
    人民法院不仅应当而且能够实行公开审判，这也是由我国人民法院的本质所决定的。在我国，法律代表着人民的意志，人民法院代表着全国人民的最大利益对案件进行审判。这种审判合乎真理和正义，没有什么不可告人的地方，这就是我国人民法院可能实行公开审判的条件。根据我国宪法和人民法院组织法的规定，人民法院审理案件也有不公开进行的。这主要是指下列两种类型案件：一种是涉及国家机密的案件，另一种是涉及生活隐私而对社会有不良影响的案件。法律规定这两种类型的案件不公开进行审理，是从维护国家和人民的利益或从尊重人民的民主权利以及社会公益观点出发的，因而这种规定丝毫也不和公开审判的原则抵触；同时，这些案件虽然不公开审理，但还是要公开宣判，所以也能收到教育人民的效果。
    同我国人民法院相反，资产阶级国家法院则不可能实行真正民主的公开审判。它们审理案件虽然有时也“公开”进行，但实际上在被压迫的劳动群众中起不到教育作用，这是由于资产阶级国家的法院和法律都是为少数统治阶级的利益服务，是对劳动人民实行专横压迫的工具。因此，资产阶级国家的法院和法律只有威胁的作用，没有说服的作用。尤其是对于劳动人民，资产阶级国家的法律和审判不仅不能收到教育的效果，而且还会引起人民对于法院的憎恶，激起人民的反抗。在这种情况下，资产阶级国家的法院往往公然拒绝劳动人民到法庭旁听。如果说在资本主义尚未进入帝国主义阶段以前，资产阶级国家还尽量在外表上保持诉讼公开的民主形式，那么在资本主义进入帝国主义阶段，进入军事法西斯独裁的时期以后，为了不暴露反动统治集团的黑暗内幕，特别是为了掩盖其对于和平民主人士的迫害，资产阶级对于诉讼公开的原则已经变得越来越有顾忌，甚至不惜采用一切粗暴的手段加以破坏。一九四九年美国资产阶级的法院对美国共产党领袖们的“审判”，就是一个最典型的例子。在审理这个非法捏造的案件的时候，只开了一个仅仅容纳百人以下的法庭，参加旁听的人都是密探、警察的代理人或是被挑选出来的资产阶级的代表。在法院的周围还布置了很多密探和一支很大的警察队，以保护他们的卑鄙“审判”。
    在社会主义国家和人民民主国家中，才有可能真正实行革命的法制。公开审判是革命法制的重要标志之一。过去，我国各级人民法院都实行过公开审判，对于某些具有社会教育意义的典型案件还特别选择最便利于群众参加的地点和时间进行公开审判，以广泛吸引群众参加旁听。公开审判在过去已经收到教育群众的效果，并取得了一定的经验。但是也必须指出，目前各地法院干部对于公开审判这一民主法制的运用，在认识上还是有着若干偏差的。例如有的干部认为公开审判就是要大张旗鼓地召开“公审大会”，而不知道日常审判随时都要容许和欢迎群众旁听（对于某些具有社会教育意义的案件应有意识地吸引更多的群众参加，但不应采用那种把法庭审讯和群众控诉混而为一的“公审”形式）。有的干部认为公开审判可以用公开宣判来代替，因而只满足于召开宣判大会，而不按审判程序实行公开审判，这是不懂得公开审判除了教育作用之外，还体现着审判上的民主，单纯的公开宣判是不能代替公开审判的。也有的干部把公开审判单纯看成是一种民主形式，而忽略了它应有的民主内容和实质，这也是错误的。应当认识：公开审判的审判活动是调查研究案件的重要过程，对于案件的判决主要应以审判庭所调查的事实为依据，因此在审理案件中，审判人员必须实事求是，必须让一切和案件有关的人尽量说话，凡是他们所提出的有关问题，都应当细心听取，并加以慎重调查研究。只有认真发扬民主，把公开审判的民主形式和它的民主实质统一起来，才易于弄清案情，作出正确的判决，并有效地教育群众。
    公开审判是我国宪法所规定的司法民主化的一项重要原则，它的政治意义是很重大的，同时它又是人民法院建立和贯彻陪审、合议、回避、辩护等各项民主化制度的基本环节，各级人民法院应当认真学习并切实贯彻执行这个制度，以充分发挥它的实际作用。
