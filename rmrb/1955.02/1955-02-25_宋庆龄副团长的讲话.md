Comrade Ambassador, Comrades Soldiers and Non-Commissioned Officers, Comrades Officers and Generals:

　　The Soviet people and their armed forces—the Soviet Army—are China’s comrades in times of difficulty. The Soviet people have consistently provided moral support to the Chinese people’s liberation struggle. Especially when the Chinese people were under the iron heel of Japanese imperialism, it was you, the heroic Soviet Army, who completely crushed the Japanese Kwantung Army, liberated tens of millions of our compatriots in Northeast China, and enabled the Chinese people to quickly achieve the final victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan. The Soviet Army’s lofty internationalist action is unforgettable to the Chinese people, and it will forever be recorded in the glorious annals of friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. Here, please allow me to pay my highest respects to the great friends of the Chinese people, the Soviet people and the Soviet Army!

　　In the early days of the founding of the People’s Republic of China, our national defense forces were still relatively weak, and the imperialists threatened the young New China in various ways. They attempted to follow the old path that the Japanese militarists had taken to invade the People's China. At this time, it was you, the heroic Soviet Army, who, in accordance with the Sino–Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance and related agreements, helped us guard the gateway to our Northeast—the Lushunkou Naval Base. This powerful measure greatly consolidated our national defense, not only enabling our people to devote themselves to economic recovery and construction, but also promoting our national defense construction. Now, as our national defense forces have been strengthened, you have begun to withdraw from Lushunkou. Your sincere and selfless internationalist assistance to the Chinese people is evident to the world. Here, please allow me to once again express my heartfelt gratitude to the Soviet Army, the defender of the great cause of peace!

　　During your stationing at the Lushunkou Naval Base, you demonstrated the lofty qualities of the Soviet Army cultivated by the Soviet Communist Party. While holding your weapons tightly, you spared no effort to guard China’s coast, and at the same time, you enthusiastically helped the local Chinese people with tremendous peaceful labor. Your high degree of internationalist awareness and excellent communist qualities have left a very deep impression on our people. This profound friendship established between the Soviet Army and the Chinese people is undoubtedly a shining embodiment of the new type of international relations between China and the Soviet Union. Here, please allow me to extend my brotherly greetings to the Soviet Army, the friendship envoy of the Soviet people.

　　The American aggressive bloc is now stepping up the creation of international tensions and pursuing a policy of war. However, in the face of the great unity of the Chinese and Soviet peoples, any war plan of the aggressors is destined to be shattered. Chairman Mao Zedong said: “The close unity of the great Chinese and Soviet peoples and their armed forces is a reliable guarantee of peace in the Far East and the world.” For the common interests of our two countries, for world peace and human progress, let us consolidate and develop this close unity even further!

　　Cheers to the Soviet Army, the reliable defender of peace in the Far East and the world!
　　Cheers to world peace!
　　Cheers to everyone's health!

    宋庆龄副团长的讲话大使同志、战士和士官同志们、军官和将军同志们：
    苏联人民及其武装力量——苏联军队，是中国人民的患难之交。苏联人民对中国人民的解放斗争一贯给予道义上的支持。特别是在中国人民处在日本帝国主义的侵略铁蹄下的时候，正是你们，英勇的苏联军队，彻底击溃了日本关东军，解放了东北的数千万我国同胞，使中国人民能够迅速地获得了抗日战争的最后胜利。苏联军队的这种崇高的国际主义的行动是中国人民永志不忘的，它将永垂在中苏两国人民友好的光荣史册上。在这里，请允许我向中国人民的伟大的朋友，苏联人民和苏联军队致以崇高的敬意！
    在中华人民共和国成立之初，我国国防力量还比较薄弱，帝国主义者曾从各方面来恐吓年轻的新中国，它们企图沿着日本军国主义者曾经走过的老路，来侵略人民中国。在这个时候，又是你们，英勇的苏联军队，根据中苏友好同盟互助条约及有关协定，帮助我们守卫着我国东北的门户——旅顺口海军根据地。这一有力措施大大地巩固了我国国防，不仅使我国人民能够放手进行经济恢复和建设事业，并且促进了我国的国防建设。现在，当我国国防力量已经加强的时候，你们就开始从旅顺口撤退，你们对中国人民的这种真诚无私的国际主义的援助，是举世共见的。在这里，请再允许我向伟大的和平事业的保卫者——苏联军队致以衷心的感谢！
    你们在驻守旅顺口海军根据地的时期中，表现了苏联共产党所培养出来的苏联军队的崇高品质。你们一面紧握着武器，不辞劳苦地守卫着中国的海防，一面又用巨大的和平劳动给当地我国人民以热诚的帮助。你们的高度的国际主义素养和优秀的共产主义品质，在我国人民当中留下了十分深刻的印象。苏联军队和中国人民之间建立的这种深厚友谊，毫无疑义是中苏两国间新型国际关系的光辉体现。在这里，请允许我向作为苏联人民的友谊使者的苏联军队，致以兄弟的敬礼。
    美国侵略集团现在正在加紧制造国际紧张局势，推行战争政策。但是，在中苏两国人民的伟大团结前面，侵略者的任何战争计划都是注定要被粉碎的。毛泽东主席说过：“伟大的苏中两国人民及其武装力量的亲密团结是远东及世界和平的可靠保障”。为了我们两国的共同利益，为了世界和平和人类进步，让我们的这种亲密团结更加巩固和发展起来！
    为远东和世界和平的可靠保卫者苏联军队干杯！
    为世界和平干杯！
    为各位的健康干杯！
