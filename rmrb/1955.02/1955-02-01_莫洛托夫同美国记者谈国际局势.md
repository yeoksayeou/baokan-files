(Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 31st) TASS Moscow, January 31st: On January 29, 1955, V.M. Molotov spoke with American journalists W.L. Hearst and Kingsbury Smith.

Hearst said that this was his first visit to the Soviet Union, and he was very pleased to make this trip to visit the Soviet Union. He said that he and his companions had been greeted with a friendly welcome by the Soviet people everywhere, which pleasantly surprised him. Therefore, he could not help but hope that U.S.-Soviet relations could be greatly improved and continuously improve, which would be beneficial to both the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and to the entire world.

Molotov said that the current state of Soviet-American relations made it impossible not to hope that these relations would improve. As for the Soviet people's attitude towards the American people, it has always been friendly.

Hearst said he believed this.

Hearst then requested V.M. Molotov to allow him to ask some questions about the current international situation.

Molotov agreed.

Hearst said that the recently complicated situation in the Far East was obviously the most important international issue at present. He asked whether Molotov thought that the situation in the Formosa region was a serious threat to world peace.

Molotov replied: The situation in the Taiwan (the Chinese name for Formosa now commonly used in the Soviet Union) region certainly attracts and should attract everyone's attention, because this situation creates tension in the Far East and has an adverse effect on the overall international situation. It creates a threat to peace and the outbreak of war. Molotov could not help but add that he believed that the responsibility for this situation lies with the United States due to its interference in China's internal affairs.

Molotov said: We believe that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China.

Kingsbury Smith said that, in this regard, he would like to mention to Molotov what Eden had recently said, namely: China has not in fact controlled Formosa for many years.

Hearst added, "Probably for about a hundred years."

Molotov replied: There is currently the Cairo Declaration signed by the United States and the United Kingdom, and there is the Potsdam Proclamation signed by the United States and the United Kingdom. In addition, there is an agreement on Japan's surrender signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. According to all these major international documents, Taiwan is Chinese territory and should be returned to China. This was also affirmed by the US President in a statement issued in 1950. Molotov continued: It can be seen from this that Japan previously occupied the island, and who occupies it now? It is the United States. Therefore, it can be said that first one country, and now another country, is encroaching on Chinese territory.

As for Eden's statement, it can be discussed specifically.

Kingsbury Smith said that Molotov was a well-known pragmatist of our time. He must understand that, under the current circumstances, the United States is unlikely to abandon its protection of Formosa until it sees that peace in the Far East has been guaranteed. Therefore, it can be said that it is possible to seek a solution to the threat to peace within the realm of reality. Kingsbury Smith said that, in this regard, Hearst also wanted to ask a question.

Hearst said that the Soviet government had successfully worked at the Geneva Conference to prevent the expansion of the Indochina conflict. Now we would like to ask whether the Soviet government is prepared to take similar action on the Formosa issue.

Molotov replied that, of course, the Indochina issue is very different from the China issue. However, on one point, the Soviet Union's position is the same for Indochina, for China, or for any other region, that is: the Soviet Union is concerned about easing international tensions. The Soviet Union will support any measures that can promote the easing of international tensions, any measures that can truly help achieve this goal, however, the measures proposed must be truly for the purpose of easing international tensions. One country interfering in the affairs of another country cannot help achieve this goal.

Molotov added to the point of being pragmatic, his view is that if a realistic attitude is taken towards modern China, then it should be different from the attitude that some countries used to take towards China. Now, all of China's territory is unified under the administration of the central government. This did not exist until recently. The Chinese people feel that this is what they have achieved after many great difficulties, and they regard it as a great victory for their nation. Separating any part of China's territory is absolutely contrary to the national sentiments of the Chinese people, and will therefore arouse their extremely resolute protest and anger. Therefore, if we look at the situation from a realistic point of view, then it should be said that modern China is a country that, more than ever before, demands respect for its national rights and interests. Only by adopting such an attitude and understanding this can relations with China develop in a direction that is beneficial to both sides. As for the Soviet Union, it is developing relations with China on the basis of equal rights, friendship, and mutual consideration of each other's interests. This is producing positive results.

Kingsbury Smith said that he and Hearst understood the Soviet Union's position on this issue. But it seems that the most important issue is to find some solution, at least a temporary solution, to prevent the danger from expanding and turning into a war that could endanger world peace.

Molotov replied: China does not threaten anyone, and it would be very good if no one threatened China. This is what is most needed to consolidate peace and establish normal relations in the Taiwan region.

Hearst asked whether, if the U.S. government were to mediate and ask its Chinese friend, Chiang Kai-shek, to seek a peaceful solution, the Soviet government would be willing to do the same with its Chinese ally to prevent the expansion of the war.

Molotov replied: Hearst should understand that the government of the People's Republic of China and the so-called Chiang Kai-shek government are not equal parties. The government of the People's Republic of China has every reason to demand the restoration of its legitimate rights in Taiwan. And the Chiang Kai-shek "government," which has been abandoned by the Chinese people, should go elsewhere, instead of staying in a place where it should not be, with the support of the United States, and damaging international relations as it is currently doing. All steps that help to solve this problem will be supported by the Soviet government.

Molotov continued: We believe that, in accordance with the actual situation and the historical changes that have taken place in China and the entire Far East, promoting the restoration of a normal situation in the Taiwan region and the entire Far East is beneficial to the United States itself.

Kingsbury Smith asked what the Soviet government's attitude was towards implementing a temporary ceasefire, for example, whether a temporary ceasefire of about one month could be implemented in order to allow Chiang Kai-shek's troops to withdraw from some of the islands (Dachen) along the Chinese coast, in order to avoid the enormous losses that both sides might suffer in the event of an attempt to seize these islands by force. This would also help prevent the danger of conflict escalation, which is possible under the current circumstances. Kingsbury Smith added that this approach should be regarded as a temporary measure, and that if it is not yet possible to seek a permanent ceasefire between the armed forces of both sides under the current circumstances, then this could be the first step towards a final solution to the entire problem.

Molotov said that he could answer with a brief sentence: if Chiang Kai-shek is determined to withdraw his own troops from any of these islands, then I am afraid no one will stop him from doing so.

Kingsbury Smith followed up by asking, does this mean that if Chiang Kai-shek decides to withdraw his troops, the Chinese troops on the mainland will not attack them during the withdrawal process, nor will they attack any ships that may be used to help with the withdrawal.

Molotov replied: he was not authorized to speak on behalf of the government of the People's Republic of China, he said that this question should be asked to the Chinese government.

Kingsbury Smith asked whether the Soviet government would be willing to submit this question to the government of the People's Republic of China on behalf of the United States.

Molotov asked in return, "Is that what the US government wants us to do?"

Hearst said that, in view of what Molotov said, he was not authorized to speak on behalf of the Chinese government on the mainland, he (Hearst) would like to make it clear that neither he nor Kingsbury Smith was speaking or making suggestions on behalf of Chiang Kai-shek or the U.S. government.

Hearst continued, he and Kingsbury Smith had raised all the questions related to the Far East that they were interested in, and they thanked Molotov for the answers he gave them. Hearst requested Molotov to allow him to ask some questions about European affairs.

Molotov agreed.

Hearst said that Chairman of the Council of Ministers G.M. Malenkov said in his New Year's greetings to the American people conveyed through the American Telegraph and Telephone Agency that the main reason for the tension in U.S.-Soviet relations was the U.S.'s establishment of a network of military bases around the Soviet Union and countries close to the Soviet Union. In order to start moving towards disarmament by gradually reducing armed forces, and in order to create good conditions for coexistence, would the Soviet government be prepared to withdraw its army and air force bases in the Soviet zone of occupation in Austria before a treaty with Austria has been concluded, if Western countries take the same action in their own zones of occupation?

Hearst explained that he was asking this question again in the capacity of a journalist.

Molotov replied: Two questions are being discussed here. The first question is about Austria, and the second question is about the United States establishing military bases around the Soviet Union.

As for the Austrian question, Molotov believed that Hearst was very clear about the Soviet Union's point of view.

As for the US military bases surrounding the Soviet Union and the people's democracies, this is actually a problem that complicates the entire international situation, because these bases prove that one side, namely the United States, is taking an unfriendly attitude towards the Soviet Union, and is creating a threat to the Soviet Union by establishing these military bases near the Soviet border. This situation cannot promote the easing of international tensions, nor can it promote the resolution of the issue of disarmament, which is of concern to broad sections of the people in all countries. Of course, the United States' establishment of military bases near the Soviet border is one of the factors hindering the resolution of many other issues (not just the Austrian issue), because the establishment of these military bases proves that the Soviet Union hopes to improve relations with the United States, while the United States has the opposite desire.

Kingsbury Smith said that he and Hearst certainly would not agree with the view that the U.S.'s actions on the issue of bases were unfriendly actions. These actions were taken out of security considerations and a desire to safeguard peace. However, Kingsbury Smith believed that if the cancellation of bases in Austria, which is close to the Soviet Union, were to begin, then this approach could gradually be extended to other regions.

Hearst said that everything must start somewhere.

Molotov asked Hearst what his view was on the possibility of starting by canceling military bases in one region first, and then extending it to other regions, what his view was on the possibility of canceling the bases in Austria first, and then continuing to cancel bases in other regions? Kingsbury Smith said that such an approach is infectious.

Molotov pointed out that it is probably not sufficient to proceed solely on the basis of such a hope.

Hearst said that it would be helpful if Americans and Soviets could better understand each other. In short, the United States has never launched an offensive war in its entire history. Hearst repeated that everything must start somewhere.

Molotov replied that the Soviet Union has not established military bases or other bases near the United States. As for the United States, it apparently needs to establish bases in a country bordering the Soviet Union like Norway for its security, and it must establish bases in Turkey, which is also adjacent to the Soviet Union, and probably must establish bases in Pakistan, not to mention other regions in Europe and Asia. To ensure the security of the United States, it seems that Taiwan is also needed. If the security of the United States is understood so broadly, then it can even be said that bases must be established in all countries for the security of the United States. Such a plan is unlikely to be met with sympathy and understanding by the people of other countries, because they know what sovereignty, independence, national rights and interests are. Molotov continued, the Soviet view is affirmative: neither from the point of view of the interests of the United States itself, nor from the interests of the world, is it possible to achieve any good results with all these bases. And what unbiased person would agree that establishing military bases in many countries, especially in places close to the borders of another country, is for the sake of U.S. security? Molotov believed that there was no such simple-minded person. All of this cannot be explained by the interests of U.S. security, because no one is threatening U.S. security, and as for the Soviet Union, it does not threaten anyone or any country at all. The Soviet Union is busy with its own internal affairs, which are enough, and it is of course concerned about safeguarding peace, just like the people of other countries. As for the point that the establishment of US military bases does not prove its unfriendly attitude towards the Soviet Union, it can be said this way: if these bases are cancelled, and the two countries transition to the state that normally exists between countries that maintain normal relations with each other, it would greatly improve the relations between our two countries.

Kingsbury Smith said that he and Hearst could elaborate in detail the reasons why the US government and the American people believe that the establishment of US military bases is in line with their security interests and the interests of world peace. But he and Hearst were afraid that if they continued to talk like this, they might get drawn into a purely theoretical debate with Molotov, and they believed that they could not win the debate with Molotov. In addition, because they had taken up a lot of Molotov's time, they asked for forgiveness and expressed their gratitude to Molotov for spending so much time and energy.

Hearst finally thanked Molotov for the reception, and thanked Molotov for spending so much time answering his questions.

    莫洛托夫同美国记者谈国际局势
    【新华社三十一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科三十一日电：一九五五年一月二十九日，维·米·莫洛托夫同美国记者威·伦·赫斯特和金斯伯里·史密斯谈话。
    赫斯特说，他是第一次来苏联，他很满意能作这一次旅行，来参观苏联，并且说，他和他的同行者到处都受到苏联人友好的欢迎，这使他愉快地感到意外。因此，他不禁希望美苏关系能大加改善并且不断改善，这既对美苏两国有益，也对全世界有益。
    莫洛托夫说，目前苏美关系的情况使人不能不希望这种关系有所改善。至于苏联人民对美国人的态度，则向来就是友好的。
    赫斯特说，他相信这一点。
    赫斯特接着请求维·米·莫洛托夫准许他提出一些关于目前国际局势的问题。
    莫洛托夫表示同意。
    赫斯特说，最近复杂起来的远东局势显然是目前国际问题中最重要的一个问题，他并问，莫洛托夫是否认为福摩萨地区的局势是对世界和平的严重威胁。
    莫洛托夫答道：台湾（这是苏联现在通用的福摩萨的中国名称）地区的局势当然引起了而且应该会引起大家的注意，因为这种局势造成了远东的紧张局面，并且对整个国际局势起了不良影响，它造成破坏和平和发生战争的威胁。莫洛托夫对这一点不能不补充一句，他认为，由于美国干涉中国内政，这种局面的责任是在美国身上。
    莫洛托夫说：我们认为台湾是中国的不可分割的一部分。
    金斯伯里·史密斯说，关于这一点，他想对莫洛托夫提起艾登最近所说过的话，即：中国事实上已经有许多年没有控制福摩萨了。
    赫斯特补充说，“大概有一百年左右了。”
    莫洛托夫回答说：目前存在着美国和英国曾经签字的开罗宣言，存在着美国和英国曾经签字的波茨坦公告。此外，还存在着美国、英国和苏联曾经签字的关于日本投降的协定。根据所有这些主要的国际文件，台湾是中国的领土，应当归还中国。后来美国总统在一九五零年所发表的声明中也肯定了这一点。莫洛托夫继续说：由此可见，以前是日本占领了这个岛屿，而现在是谁占领了呢？是美国。所以说，起先是一个国家，而现在是另外一个国家侵占了中国的领土。
    至于艾登的声明，可以专门来谈谈。
    金斯伯里·史密斯说，莫洛托夫是当代一位著名的讲求现实的人。他谅必懂得，在目前的情况下，美国在没有看到远东的和平已有保证以前，很少有可能会放弃对福摩萨的保护。因此，可以说，在现实的范围内谋求解决对和平的威胁的问题是可能的。金斯伯里·史密斯说，关于这一点，赫斯特还想提出一个问题。
    赫斯特说，苏联政府在日内瓦会议上曾经成功地致力于防止印度支那冲突的扩大。现在我们想问，苏联政府是不是准备在福摩萨问题上也采取类似的行动。
    莫洛托夫回答说，当然，印度支那问题同中国问题是有很大的区别的。然而在有一点上，苏联无论对印度支那，对中国，或者对其他任何地区的立场都是一样的，那就是：苏联关心于缓和国际紧张局势。苏联会支持任何能促进缓和国际紧张局势的措施，任何能真正有助于达到这个目的的措施，然而，必须所提出的措施是真正为了缓和国际紧张局势的。一个国家干涉另外一个国家的事务，就不能有助于达到这个目的。
    莫洛托夫对讲求现实一点作了一些补充，他的看法是，如果用现实的态度来对待现代的中国，那就应该同某些国家过去对中国所习惯采取的态度有所不同了。现在，中国的全部领土都统一在中央政府的管理之下。这在不久以前都还是没有的。中国人民感觉到，这是他们经过许多巨大的困难争取得来的，他们把这看作是他们民族的伟大胜利。把中国的任何一部分领土割裂开来是和中国人民的民族感情绝对相违背的，因此会引起他们无比坚决的抗议和愤怒。因此，如果从现实的观点来看局势，那么就应当说，现代的中国是这样一个国家，它前所未有地要求尊重它的民族权利和利益。只有采取这样的态度和了解了这一点，同中国的关系才能朝着有利于双方的方向发展。至于苏联，它正是在权利平等、友好、互相考虑对方利益的基础上，和中国发展关系。这一点正在产生积极的结果。
    金斯伯里·史密斯说，他和赫斯特都了解苏联在这个问题上的立场。但是似乎最重要的问题是，要找出某种解决办法，至少是暂时的解决办法，来防止危险扩大和变成可能危及世界和平的战火。
    莫洛托夫回答说：中国不威胁任何人，如果没有人威胁中国，那就很好了。这是在台湾地区巩固和平和建立正常关系所最需要的。
    赫斯特问道，如果美国政府进行斡旋要求它的中国朋友，即蒋介石，谋求和平解决，苏联政府是否将愿意向它的中国盟友做同样的事情来阻止战争的扩大。
    莫洛托夫回答说：赫斯特应当了解，中华人民共和国政府和所谓蒋介石政府不是平等的两方。中华人民共和国政府完全有理由要求恢复它在台湾的合法权利。而被中国人民唾弃了的蒋介石“政府”应当滚到其他地方去，而不是在美国的支持下留在他所不应当在的地方，让它像目前所做的那样损害国际关系。一切有助于解决这一问题的步骤都将得到苏联政府的支持。
    莫洛托夫接着说：我们认为，按照实际情况以及在中国和整个远东发生的历史性的变化，促使台湾地区和整个远东地区恢复正常局面，是对美国自身有好处的。
    金斯伯里·史密斯问道，苏联政府对实行临时停火的问题抱怎样的态度，比如说能不能实行为期约一个月的临时停火，以便让蒋介石的军队撤出中国沿岸的一些岛屿（大陈），以便避免在一旦企图以武力夺取这些岛屿时双方都可能遭受的巨大损失。这样还能有助于防止冲突扩大的危险，在目前情况下冲突扩大是可能的。金斯伯里·史密斯加上一句说，这种办法应该认为是临时的措施，而且如果在目前情况下还没有可能求得双方武装部队的永久停火，那么这可以是走向最终解决整个问题的第一步。
    莫洛托夫说，他可以用简短的一句话回答：如果蒋介石一定想要从这些岛屿中的任何一个撤出他自己的军队，那么恐怕不会有人去阻止他这样做。
    金斯伯里·史密斯跟着问道，这是不是说：如果蒋介石决定撤退自己的军队，大陆上的中国军队不会在蒋介石军队撤退过程中对他们进行攻击，也不会对可能用来帮助撤退的船只进行攻击。
    莫洛托夫答道：他没有受权代替中华人民共和国政府说话，他说，这个问题应该去问中国政府。
    金斯伯里·史密斯问道，苏联政府是否愿意代美国把这一问题提交中华人民共和国政府。
    莫洛托夫反问道：“是不是美国政府要我们这样做？”
    赫斯特说，鉴于莫洛托夫所说，他没有受权代表大陆上的中国政府发言，他（赫斯特）愿意说清楚，他本人和金斯伯里·史密斯都不是代表蒋介石或是代表美国政府说话和提出建议的。
    赫斯特接着说道，他和金斯伯里·史密斯提出了他们所感到兴趣的、有关远东的一切问题，他们感谢莫洛托夫给予他们的答复。赫斯特请求莫洛托夫允许他提出一些有关欧洲事务的问题。
    莫洛托夫表示同意。
    赫斯特说，部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫在经由美国电讯通讯社转达美国人民的新年贺词中说道，美苏关系紧张的主要原因是美国在苏联和同苏联接近的国家周围建立军事基地网。为了以逐步缩减武装部队的方法开始向裁减军备的方向迈进，为了对共处建立良好的条件，苏联政府是否准备在对奥和约还没有缔结之前撤除它在奥地利苏联占领区中的陆军和空军基地，如果西方国家在自己占领区中也采取同样的行动的话？
    赫斯特说明，他又是用新闻记者的身份提出这一问题的。
    莫洛托夫回答说：这里谈的是两个问题。第一个问题是关于奥地利的问题，第二个问题是关于美国在苏联周围建立军事基地的问题。
    至于奥地利问题，莫洛托夫认为，苏联的观点赫斯特是很明白的。
    至于包围苏联和人民民主国家的美国军事基地的问题，那么这实际上是一个使整个国际局势复杂化的问题，因为这些基地证明了，一方，即美国，对苏联采取不友好的态度，在靠近苏联边界的地方建立这些军事基地而对苏联造成威胁。这种情况既不能促进国际紧张局势的缓和，又不能促进解决各国广泛阶层的人民所关心的关于裁减军备的问题。当然，美国在靠近苏联边界的地方建立军事基地，是妨碍解决许多其他问题（而不仅仅是奥地利问题）的因素之一，因为这些军事基地的建立证明了，苏联希望改善同美国的关系，而美国方面却抱着相反的愿望。
    金斯伯里·史密斯说，他和赫斯特当然不会同意美国在基地问题方面的行动是不友好的行动这种看法。这种行动是出于安全的考虑和保障和平的愿望。但是，金斯伯里·史密斯认为，如果从取消在接近苏联的奥地利的基地开始，那么这种做法也可以逐步推及到其他地区。
    赫斯特说，总必须从某个地方开始的。
    莫洛托夫问赫斯特说，他对于先从取消一个地区的军事基地开始，然后推及到其他地区这种可能性有什么看法，他对于先取消奥地利的基地，再继续取消其他地区的基地的可能性的看法怎样？金斯伯里·史密斯说，这种做法是有感染性的。
    莫洛托夫指出，如果仅仅根据这样一种希望出发，那是未必充分的。
    赫斯特说，如果美国人和苏联人能够比较好地互相了解，对事情是有帮助的。总而言之，美国在它的全部历史上从来没有发动过进攻战争。赫斯特重复说，总必须从某个地方开始。
    莫洛托夫回答说，苏联没有在靠近美国的地方建立军事基地或其他基地。至于美国，它为了安全，原来竟必须在像挪威这样一个和苏联接壤的国家中建立基地，必须在也是和苏联毗邻的土耳其建立基地，大概也必须在巴基斯坦建立基地，更不必说欧洲和亚洲的其他地区了。为了保障美国安全，似乎还需要台湾。如果这样广泛地来理解美国的安全，那么甚至可以说，为了美国的安全，就必须在所有的国家中建立基地。这样的计划未必会得到其他国家人民的同情和谅解，因为他们知道：什么是主权、独立、民族的权利和利益。莫洛托夫接着说，苏联人的意见是肯定的：不论从美国本身的利益来看，或者是从世界的利益来看，它是不可能用这一切基地来取得任何好的结果的。又有那一个没有偏见的人会同意，在许多国家中，特别是在靠近另外一个国家边境的地方建立军事基地是为美国的安全着想的呢。莫洛托夫认为，没有这样头脑简单的人。这一切都是不能用美国安全的利益来解释的，因为没有人在威胁美国的安全，至于苏联，它根本不威胁任何人和任何国家。苏联忙于自己够多的内部事务，它当然也和其他国家的人民一样地关心于保障和平。至于提到美国建立军事基地并不能证明它对苏联的不友好态度这一点，那可以这样说：如果取消这些基地，使两国转入那些互相维持正常关系的国家之间所通常存在的状态，那就会大大改善我们两国之间的关系。
    金斯伯里·史密斯说，他和赫斯特可以详细地申述理由，说明为什么美国政府和美国人民认为建立美国军事基地是符合他们的安全的利益和世界和平的利益。但是他和赫斯特恐怕这样谈下去，可能同莫洛托夫卷入一场纯粹的辩论，并且他们相信，他们是辩不过莫洛托夫的。此外，因为他们已占了莫洛托夫不少时间，他们请求原谅并对莫洛托夫花这么多时间和精神表示感谢。
    赫斯特最后感谢莫洛托夫的接见，并感谢莫洛托夫花这么多时间来回答他的问题。
