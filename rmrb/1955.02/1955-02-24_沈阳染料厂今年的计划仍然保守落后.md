    Shenyang Dyestuff Factory's Plan for This Year Remains Conservative and Backward
    Zhou Xin
      On November 28, 1954, the front page of the People's Daily published a Xinhua News Agency report stating that after Premier Zhou's criticism, the Shenyang Dyestuff Factory had learned from past experiences and was actively exploring its potential to formulate a draft plan for 1955. The draft plan for 1955 of the Shenyang Dyestuff Factory does show some improvement compared to 1954. However, after review and research by the Chemical Industry Bureau of the Ministry of Heavy Industry, the Shenyang Dyestuff Factory's plan is still considered a relatively backward one within the dye system under the Chemical Industry Bureau in many aspects. Before the formulation of the 1955 draft plan, the Chemical Industry Bureau convened a symposium in the Shenyang area for its affiliated factories to discuss the spirit of the 1955 plan formulation, combined with Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report." At the meeting, the responsible comrade of the planning section of the Shenyang Dyestuff Factory did not have a deep understanding of the factory's consistent conservatism in planning, attributing the conservatism of the plan to objective circumstances, rather than seriously conducting a comprehensive self-examination from a subjective perspective. He said at the meeting: "After reading Premier Zhou's report, the factory also summarized and analyzed it, but where exactly is the conservative thinking? The conservatism of the product plan is due to the planning section's lack of grasp of objective factors. The profit issue of the financial plan is mainly due to the overfulfillment of profits by more than 6 billion yuan due to increased production." Because they failed to seriously examine conservative thinking in terms of ideology and various aspects of the plan, they could not actively take measures to improve technical management and labor organization, and reflect this in the 1955 plan. Therefore, the 1955 draft plan still reflects a relatively backward plan.
    Analyzing from the comprehensive indicator of the 1955 cost plan, the unit cost of Shenyang Dyestuff Factory's main product, vulcanized alkali, whether it is 50 degrees or 60 degrees, is the highest in the entire bureau. The unit cost of 50% vulcanized alkali at Shenyang Dyestuff Factory is 9% higher than that of Qingdao Dyestuff Factory. The unit cost of 60% vulcanized alkali at Shenyang Dyestuff Factory is 22% higher than that of Tianjin Dyestuff Factory. However, Shenyang Dyestuff Factory is still considering using cheaper sodium bisulfate to replace part of Glauber's salt in the manufacturing process, while Tianjin and Qingdao factories use all higher-priced Glauber's salt. Why is the cost of Shenyang Dyestuff Factory higher than that of its brother factories? The main reason is that there are still many problems in technical management and operation, resulting in serious waste and high raw material consumption quotas. For 50% vulcanized alkali, Qingdao Dyestuff Factory's Glauber's salt consumption quota is 1.17 tons, while Shenyang Dyestuff Factory is as high as 1.319 tons (the planned quota for this item in 1954 was 1.320 tons, with no improvements in 1955). Qingdao Dyestuff Factory's Glauber's salt utilization rate reaches 85.9%, while Shenyang Dyestuff Factory is only 72.64%, which means that Shenyang Dyestuff Factory uses 149 kilograms more Glauber's salt per ton of vulcanized alkali. If calculated according to Shenyang Dyestuff Factory's total output in 1955, it will consume 894 tons more Glauber's salt, costing the state an additional 1.6 billion yuan, a staggering figure.
    Analyzing the workshop expenses of vulcanized alkali, it is also the highest among the enterprises under the Chemical Industry Bureau. Shenyang Dyestuff Factory's output is 1.4 times that of Dalian Dyestuff Factory. Under normal circumstances, the increase in expenses should be less than the increase in output, but the workshop expenses are 1.5 times that of Dalian Dyestuff Factory, of which the repair expenses are 1.7 times that of Dalian Dyestuff Factory, and the consumption of materials is 1.5 times that of Dalian Dyestuff Factory. Analyzing the self-used semi-finished product dinitrochlorobenzene, the cost of Shenyang Dyestuff Factory is 9% higher than that of Dalian Dyestuff Factory, and the main raw material consumption quota is also the highest among all factories. This aspect is not listed in detail.
    There are also problems in labor organization. Nanjing Chemical Plant uses only two people per shift for five nitration pots, while Shenyang Dyestuff Factory uses three people per shift for two nitration pots. There are also problems in labor organization in the vulcanized blue workshop. Shenyang Dyestuff Factory's vulcanized blue output is only 54% of Dalian Dyestuff Factory's, while the number of production workers is 17% higher than that of Dalian Dyestuff Factory. The entire vulcanized blue workshop in Dalian Dyestuff Factory has 84 people, while Shenyang Dyestuff Factory has as many as 99 people. With the same four vulcanization pots, Shenyang Dyestuff Factory needs seven people per shift, while Dalian Dyestuff Factory only needs five people. Expressed in terms of labor costs per ton of vulcanized blue, Shenyang Dyestuff Factory is as high as 130,000 yuan, while Tianjin Dyestuff Factory is only 60,000 yuan, more than twice as high as Tianjin Dyestuff Factory.
    From the above facts, it can be seen that although the draft plan of Shenyang Dyestuff Factory is somewhat improved compared to 1954, it is still a backward plan compared to its brother factories. Shenyang Dyestuff Factory should humbly learn from its brother factories, actively take measures to improve the backward phenomena of technical management and labor organization, and formulate an advanced 1955 annual cost plan that can guide production.

    沈阳染料厂今年的计划仍然保守落后
    周新
      一九五四年十一月二十八日，人民日报第一版刊登了新华社的一篇报道，说沈阳染料厂经过周总理批评以后，接受往年教训，积极挖掘潜力，来编制一九五五年计划草案。沈阳染料厂一九五五年计划草案，比较一九五四年确实有些改进，但经重工业部化学工业管理局审核研究，从很多方面的表现来看，沈阳染料厂的计划仍是化学工业管理局所属染料系统中相当落后的一个厂。在编制一九五五年计划草案前，化学工业管理局曾在沈阳地区召集所属厂举行了一次有关一九五五年计划编制精神的座谈会，并结合周总理的“政府工作报告”进行讨论。会上沈阳染料厂的计划科负责同志，对于厂里计划的一贯保守没有深刻的认识，把计划的保守的原因推到客观情况上，而不是认真地从主观上来全面检查，他在会上说：“看到周总理报告后，厂里也曾总结与分析了，但保守思想究竟在那里？产品计划保守，是由于客观因素计划科没有掌握。财务计划的利润问题，主要是由于增产而超额完成利润六十多亿元。”由于他们未能从思想及计划各个方面来认真检查保守思想，从而也就不能积极采取措施，来改进技术管理及劳动组织，并以之体现于一九五五年计划中去。因此，在一九五五年计划草案中所表现的仍然是一个比较落后的计划。
    以一九五五年成本计划这个综合指标来分析。沈阳染料厂主要产品硫化碱无论规格是五十度或六十度的，成本都是全局最高的。百分之五十硫化碱单位成本，沈阳染料厂要较青岛染料厂高出百分之九。百分之六十硫化碱单位成本，沈阳染料厂要比天津染料厂高出百分之二十二。可是沈阳染料厂在制造过程中，还考虑采用价廉的硫酸氢钠来代替一部分芒硝。而天津青岛两厂却全部使用价格较高的芒硝。为什么沈阳染料厂成本比兄弟厂高呢？主要是技术管理及操作上还存在着很多问题，以致浪费严重，原材料消耗定额高。百分之五十硫化碱，青岛染料厂芒硝消耗定额一点一七吨，而沈阳染料厂却高达一点三一九吨（一九五四年该项计划定额是
  一点三二○吨，而一九五五年无任何改进），青岛染料厂芒硝利用率达到百分之八十五点九，而沈阳染料厂只有百分之七十二点六四，也就是说每吨硫化碱沈阳染料厂要多用芒硝一百四十九公斤。如按沈阳染料厂一九五五年全年产量计算，则将多消耗芒硝八百九十四吨，使国家多支出十六亿元，数字是惊人的。
    如以硫化碱的车间经费来分析，也是化学工业管理局所属企业中最高的，沈阳染料厂产量是大连染料厂一点四倍。按一般情况费用的增长，应小于产量增长比例。而车间经费是大连染料厂的一点五倍，其中修理费是大连染料厂的一点七倍，消耗材料是大连染料厂的一点五倍。再以自用半成品二硝基氯化苯来分析。沈阳染料厂的成本比大连染料厂高出百分之九，而主要原材料消耗定额也是各厂中最高者，这方面不详细列举了。
    在劳动组织上也有问题，南京化工厂五个硝化锅每班只二人，而沈阳染料厂二个硝化锅却每班要用三人。硫化青车间在劳动组织上，同样存在问题。沈阳染料厂硫化青产量只及大连染料厂百分之五十四，而生产工人配备较大连染料厂多百分之十七。如大连染料厂硫化青全车间为八十四人，而沈阳染料厂高达九十九人。同为四个硫化锅，沈阳染料厂每班要七人，而大连染料厂只五人。表现在每吨硫化青人工费，沈阳染料厂高达十三万元，天津染料厂只六万元，高出天津染料厂一倍多。
    从以上事实看，可见沈阳染料厂的计划草案虽较一九五四年有些改进，但较兄弟厂还是一个落后的计划，沈阳染料厂还应当虚心地向兄弟厂学习，积极采取措施，改进技术管理及劳动组织的落后现象，编制出一套先进而能指导生产的一九五五年度成本计划。
