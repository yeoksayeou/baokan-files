The Hungarian Publication Festival

By Yi Komur, Member of the Editorial Board of "Free People's Daily" in Hungary

February 1st is the Hungarian Publication Festival - the anniversary of the secret founding of the "Free People's Daily" thirteen years ago. The government of the Hungarian People's Republic designated February 1st as a "red letter day" for the Hungarian publishing industry, symbolizing the Hungarian people's admiration for the "Free People's Daily" for its perseverance in the struggle during the most terrifying days of World War II. This year, commemorating the Publication Festival on the eve of the tenth anniversary of Hungary's liberation has even greater significance. Now, the Hungarian people always recall the experiences of the past decade with a festive mood, and cherish a deep gratitude for the heroic sons of the Soviet Union; it was they who, ten years ago, sprinkled their blood all over the towns and villages of Hungary, fighting from building to building in Budapest, liberating our country from Fascist enslavement.

On this Publication Festival day, let us review the development of the free publishing cause over the past ten years.

The basic content and characteristics of the Hungarian publishing industry have undergone fundamental changes, the working methods of newspapers have changed, and the relationship between readers and newspapers is completely different. Ten years ago, newspapers were practically only available in Budapest. Today, the Hungarian publishing industry is truly national, with a readership that spans the entire country.

Ten years ago, those newspapers that relied on selling pornography and fabricating rumors to numb their readers, even the most popular on the avenues, never reached a circulation of 100,000 copies. Today, the "Free People's Daily" - the central organ of the Hungarian Working People's Party - has a circulation of 700,000 copies. Other daily newspapers published in Budapest, such as the "Hungarian National Daily" - the organ of the Patriotic People's Front, and the "Free Youth Daily," also have circulations of over 70,000 copies. "People's Voice" - the organ of the National Trade Union - also has a large readership. In addition to the large national daily newspapers, there are also seventeen state newspapers and four county newspapers, all published three times a week. The popular "People's Sports" is published five times a week.

Hungary publishes sixty weekly magazines. "Free Land" - the weekly for working farmers, has a circulation of nearly 500,000 copies. The newspaper "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" published in Hungarian, regularly sells 120,000 copies. "New World" - the illustrated magazine of the Hungarian-Soviet Friendship Association - is very popular. "Matthias the Goose Boy" - a satirical and humorous weekly, has a circulation of over 400,000 copies. The science magazine "Life and Science" prints 150,000 copies. The illustrated "Peace and Freedom" sells 100,000 copies. "Women's Magazine" and "Little Friends" have circulations of 240,000 and 200,000 copies respectively, figures that no pre-war editor with the greatest ambitions would have dared to dream of.

In addition, many periodicals are published for workers in certain industrial sectors and members of various mass organizations. Various scientific, literary, artistic, and specialized professional periodicals also have a large readership. Factory newspapers and wall posters, which were not allowed to be published before liberation, are now an important part of the Hungarian publishing industry. Almost every factory, workshop, village, cooperative farm, or institution has its own wall poster, which has become its own opinion forum.

The decade of the People's Democratic system has brought new and powerful vitality to the democratic newspaper industry. It has become the people's publishing cause, speaking to the people, fighting for the people's ideal - building a socialist Hungary and defending world peace.

The achievements of the free publishing cause are inseparable from the constant care of the Hungarian Working People's Party. In the early days of liberation, the Party constantly strived to eliminate the remnants of bourgeois newspapers and magazines, and worked to establish and consolidate the people's democratic publishing cause.

As in other sectors of the socialist construction of the motherland, the publishing industry has also experienced and overcome enormous difficulties. For the twenty-five years before liberation, there was no freedom of the press in Hungary. Certain glorious chapters in the history of the Hungarian workers' movement could only be recorded in some secretly published communist newspapers at that time. The Hungarian working people will never forget the glorious martyrdom of F. Rozsa - the first editor of the "Free People's Daily". After the heroic Soviet army liberated Hungary, we not only had to restore or rebuild the printing factories that had been destroyed by the Fascists, but we also had to organize new editorial boards and train a new batch of journalists, so that they could join hands with the small number of freedom-loving journalists who had escaped Fascist terror. They knew how to call on the people, how to use the people's language to mobilize the masses to fight for the major tasks facing the motherland.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the support of the People's Democratic government, the Hungarian publishing industry has successfully completed this task. On the tenth anniversary of Hungary's free publishing industry, we can proudly declare that the ideological level of our newspapers is not lagging behind the great tasks of socialist construction; our journalists are propagandists of socialist ideology; our newspapers have millions of readers, who not only read, but also strengthen the people's publishing cause by sending tens of thousands of letters to newspaper editors.

The central topic of our newspapers is socialist construction and the various current tasks of fighting for its achievements; and the workers, farmers, and intellectuals who are building a new and better life are the main figures in the newspapers. The newspapers are a free and reliable forum for the broad masses to expose and criticize the shortcomings that exist in socialist construction. The Party constantly emphasizes the importance of criticism and self-criticism. This is an important signpost for socialist construction.

In the cause of defending world peace, our people's democratic newspapers have demonstrated our people's love for the Soviet Union. The newspapers strive to satisfy the Hungarian working people's growing concern for the lives of the Soviet people and communist construction, and strive to satisfy their desire to understand the lives of the Soviet people more deeply and broadly. Our newspapers make the relationship between us and the friendly people's democratic countries closer. It often publishes news and articles about the lives of the people of fraternal countries. The demand of the Hungarian readership for this kind of material is growing. The fact that Hungarian working people are particularly concerned about the lives of the people of the People's Republic of China, and that the editors are receiving more and more letters from readers asking about China, is proof of this.

Another important feature of our newspapers is the constant struggle for peace. The attitude of Hungarian newspapers towards the Moscow European National Conference, towards the main events of current international politics, and towards the rearmament of West Germany, is an example of this. Workers, farmers, scientists, artists, and people from all walks of life are speaking out in the newspapers against the rearmament of Germany and against all the conspiracies of imperialism that threaten peace. The newspapers are even more sensitive and firm in opposing the use of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. Through its detailed analysis of international events, and through its consistent support for the peace policy of the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic newspapers have made a valuable contribution to the Hungarian people who are building socialism and are doing their best to defend peace.

Of course, our newspapers are not without shortcomings. Ten years of development is not enough to solve all the problems facing the establishment of high-level, attractive, and combative newspapers. Although the People's Democratic government has done a lot of work to train journalists, time is still too short. The Party and mass organizations provide important assistance to the editors to improve their work. The workers also give the newspapers a lot of help. They often give opinions on the content of the newspapers in their letters or in discussion meetings. The journalists know that if they want to be competent in their posts, they must constantly learn and constantly improve themselves. To this end, Hungarian journalists closely pay attention to the achievements of the Soviet newspapers, and learn from the Soviet newspapers, the world's most advanced newspapers, which have achieved such great success in using Marxism-Leninism as a weapon.

We firmly believe that in the coming years, our people's democratic newspaper industry will achieve greater success in completing its tasks. It will attract a wider readership, will live up to the love of all the people, and will make more contributions to the cause of socialist construction in the motherland.

    匈牙利的出版节
    匈牙利“自由人民报”编辑委员会委员  伊·柯慕尔
    二月一日是匈牙利的出版节——“自由人民报”在十三年前的今天秘密地创刊了。匈牙利人民共和国政府把二月一日定为匈牙利出版界的“红字日”，象征着全匈牙利人民对“自由人民报”在第二次世界大战最恐怖的日子里坚持进行斗争的敬仰。今年，在匈牙利解放十周年的前夕纪念出版节，有着更大的意义。现在，匈牙利人民总是以过节的心情回忆过去十年的经历，对苏联的英雄的儿子怀着深厚的谢意；是他们在十年前，用自己的鲜血洒遍了匈牙利的城镇和村庄；在布达佩斯一幢一幢楼房间辗转战斗，把我们国家从法西斯奴役下解放出来。
    在出版节这一天，让我们回顾一下十年来自由出版事业的发展。
    匈牙利出版事业的基本内容和特征已有了根本的变化，报刊工作的方法改变了，读者和报刊的关系也完全不同了。十年前，实际上只在布达佩斯才有报刊。今天，匈牙利的出版事业是名副其实地具有全国性的，读者群众也遍及全国。
      十年前，那些靠着贩卖色情、捏造谣言来麻醉读者的报刊，即使是林荫道上最流行的，它的发行量也从来没有到过十万份。今天，“自由人民报”——匈牙利劳动人民党中央机关报——发行量是七十万份。其他在布达佩斯出版的各种日报，如“匈牙利民族报”——爱国人民阵线机关报和“自由青年报”的发行量也都在七万份以上。“人民之声报”——全国工会机关报——也拥有大批的读者。除了全国性的大型日报外，还有十七种州报和四种县报，都是每周出版三次。受读者欢迎的“人民体育”，每周出版五次。
    匈牙利出版了六十种周刊。“自由土地”——劳动农民的周刊，发行近五十万份，以匈文出版的
  “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”报经常销售十二万份。“新世界”——附有图片的匈苏友好协会会刊很受欢迎。“牧鹅少年马季”——讽刺幽默性的周刊，发行四十万份以上。科学杂志“生活和科学”印行十五万份。附有图片的“和平和自由”销行十万份。“妇女杂志”和“小朋友”发行量分别为二十四万份和二十万份，这是战前任何最有野心的编辑都不敢想望的发行数字。
    此外，为某些工业部门的工人和不同群众团体的会员还出版了许多定期刊物。各种科学的、文学的、艺术的以及专门业务的定期刊物也拥有众多的读者。解放前不许出版的工厂报纸和墙报，今天已是匈牙利出版事业中的重要的部分了。几乎没有一个工厂、车间、村庄、合作农庄或机关没有自己出版的成为自己舆论园地的墙报的。
    人民民主制度的十年，给民主的报刊事业带来了新的强大的活力。它已成了人民的出版事业，向着人民说话，为人民的理想——建设社会主义的匈牙利，保卫世界和平而战斗。
    自由出版事业的成就是和匈牙利劳动人民党不断的关怀分不开的。解放初期，党就不断地努力于清除资产阶级报刊的遗毒，努力于创立并巩固人民民主的出版事业。
    正如在祖国的社会主义建设事业中的其他部门一样，出版事业也经历并克服了巨大的困难。解放以前的二十五年，匈牙利是没有出版自由的。匈牙利工人运动史上的某些光辉篇章只能是记载在当时秘密出版的一些共产主义报刊上。匈牙利的劳动人民永志不忘费·罗斯查——“自由人民报”的第一个编辑的光荣殉难。英雄的苏联军队解放匈牙利之后，我们不但要恢复或重建那些已被法西斯破坏了的印刷厂，我们必须组织起新的编辑委员会，训练一批新的报刊工作者，使他们和那为数很少的逃脱了法西斯恐怖的爱好自由的报刊工作者携手合作。他们懂得怎样去号召人民，怎样用人民的语言去动员群众为祖国面临的重大的任务进行斗争。
    在共产党的领导和人民民主政府的支持下，匈牙利出版界胜利地完成了这个任务。在匈牙利自由出版事业的十周年，我们可以骄傲地宣称：我们报刊的思想水平并不落后于社会主义建设的伟大任务；我们的报刊工作者是社会主义思想的宣传者；我们的报刊拥有数百万读者，他们不只是读，而且以千万封信寄给报刊编辑来加强人民出版事业。
    我们报刊的中心论题是社会主义建设和为其成就而斗争的各种当前任务；而正在建设新的、更美好的生活的工人、农民和知识分子则是报刊上的主要人物，报刊是广大群众揭发社会主义建设中存在的缺点并对缺点进行批评的自由的可靠的园地。党经常强调批评和自我批评的重要性。这是社会主义建设的重要路标。
    在保卫世界和平的事业中，我们的人民民主报刊表现了我国人民对苏联的热爱。报刊尽力满足匈牙利劳动人民对苏联人民的生活和共产主义建设日益增涨的关怀，尽力满足他们希望更深更广地了解苏联人民生活的要求。我们的报刊使我们和友好的人民民主国家之间的关系更加密切，它经常刊载有关兄弟国家人民的生活的消息和文章。匈牙利的读者群众对于这类材料的要求正在增长。匈牙利劳动人民特别关怀中华人民共和国人民的生活，编者收到越来越多的读者来信询问中国情况，就是证明。
    我们报刊的另一重要特征是为争取和平而作不断的斗争。匈牙利报刊对于莫斯科欧洲国家会议、对于当前国际政治的主要事件、对于重新武装西德等问题的态度就是例证。工人、农民、科学家、艺术家和各阶层人民都在报刊上发言，反对重新武装德国，反对帝国主义威胁和平的各种阴谋。报刊在反对运用原子武器和氢武器上更是敏锐的和坚决的。人民民主的报刊通过它对于国际事件的详细分析，通过它对以苏联为领导的和平民主阵营的一贯的和平政策的拥护，为正在建设社会主义和正在全力保卫和平的匈牙利人民，作了有价值的贡献。
    自然，我们的报刊还不是没有缺点的。十年的发展还不足以解决为建立具有高度水平的，吸引读者的，战斗性的报刊所面临的一切问题。虽然人民民主政府曾经为训练报刊工作者作了许多工作，但时间毕竟还是太短。党和群众团体给编辑们以重要的援助，以改进他们的工作。工人们也给报刊很多帮助，他们经常在来信中或是在讨论会中对报刊的内容提出意见。报刊工作者深知如果他们想在他们的岗位上胜任，就必须不断地学习，不断地提高自己。为此，匈牙利报刊工作者密切地注意着苏联报刊的成就，并向世界上最先进的报刊在运用马克思—列宁主义这个武器上有如此巨大成绩的苏维埃报刊学习。
    我们深信，我们人民民主的报刊事业，在今后几年内，将在完成它的任务中取得更大的成就，它将吸引更广大的读者，将不负全体人民的热爱，对祖国社会主义建设事业作出更多的贡献。
