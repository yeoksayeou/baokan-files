    Tenth Anniversary of the Liberation of Budapest
    János Bárányai, Deputy Chairman of the Budapest City People's Council
    I am writing this article sitting in my office in the Budapest City Hall. Looking out the window, I can see the bustling crowds on the streets, the dazzling shop windows, and the neon signs of cafes and pastry shops. Looking at this pleasant and moving scene, my thoughts go back to what our beautiful capital looked like ten years ago: then, under the terrible rule of the Hitler German occupation forces and the Hungarian fascist running dogs, it was a desolate place. In February 1945, when the Soviet army liberated Budapest after a self-sacrificing and bloody battle, the city was almost devoid of everything. The fascist bandits blew up all the bridges over the Danube. Seventy-four percent of the capital's residences were damaged or destroyed during the siege of the city. Everywhere on the broken sidewalks were piles of rubble and tank wreckage. There was no electricity, water, or gas. Hunger threatened the residents...

    In such a tragic situation, it took boundless confidence in the strength and future of the liberated people to say such vibrant words as "We will rebuild Budapest, we will make her bigger and more beautiful than before." This is what the Hungarian Communist Party said! Its words inspired the people of Budapest to rebuild their city. Naturally, the beginning was difficult. If it weren't for the assistance of the socialist Soviet Union—Budapest's liberator—the serious food and health problems, and the problem of restoring production in factories whose raw materials had all been looted, would have created insurmountable difficulties. The Soviet government sent food to the people of Budapest and medicine to the sick. Soviet bridge engineers braved the winter storms to build the first pontoon bridge over the Danube. Then, Soviet cotton, coal, iron ore, and other raw materials were continuously transported to Budapest's factories, enabling them to resume production.

    Ten years have passed since the birth of our new life. It is not easy to summarize the achievements we have made since liberation. We have cleared the ruins and built many new public buildings and residences. In the once-forgotten working-class districts, beautiful and well-lit public dormitories have been erected. Many new parks and playgrounds have been built in the city. New theaters have been built: like the Ikár Theater, the Budapest Second Opera House, and the rebuilt modern People's Army Theater. We have built the giant People's Stadium that can accommodate 100,000 spectators—one of the largest new stadium buildings, and many smaller stadiums. Now, Budapest has one hundred and sixty football fields, four hundred and ten volleyball courts, sixty-five sports fields, and two hundred and fifty-four tennis courts.

    It is no exaggeration to say that the world-famous Budapest has become more beautiful in the past ten years. But beneath the city's appearance, the progress of the capital's daily life has even greater significance.

    The hopes of tens of thousands of people living in the working-class districts outside Budapest have been realized. These places have been integrated with the capital and are gradually catching up with the standards of the central residential areas. The old regime shamefully ignored the transportation, public utilities, public health, and cultural facilities of the suburbs. Before the war, Budapest had 1.65 million people. During the war, it was reduced to 832,000. Since liberation, the population has increased year by year and has now reached 1.7 million.

    In the past ten years, this rapidly growing and strengthening city has made amazing progress in economy, transportation, culture, and public health. Today, Budapest has four hundred iron and steel plants, metallurgical factories, and machine factories, three hundred and fifty textile factories, one hundred and fifty chemical factories, and hundreds of food factories. Budapest's old large factories, such as the Ganz Vehicle Factory, known for its streamlined vehicles, the MÁVAG Machine Factory, known for its locomotive manufacturing, and the 200-year-old Goldberger Textile Factory, have all been expanded and new workshops have been added. At the same time, dozens of new factories have been built in Budapest during these ten years.

    Budapest's manufacturing industry has huge production capacity. According to the plans of the People's regime, these production capacities are being increasingly used to produce daily necessities to improve people's living standards. Our factories are producing more and better textiles, clothing, boots, shoes, and food than ever before. The adjustment of heavy industry has freed up some of the productivity of factories that mainly manufactured means of production in the past—especially machine-building factories. These factories are now turning to the production of daily necessities. Budapest factories are beginning to produce electrical washing machines, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, floor polishers, new radios, and gramophones in large quantities. These products are being sold by department stores and specialty companies.

    The construction industry is also striving to meet the needs of citizens and solve the housing shortage left over by the capitalist system. In the past ten years, thousands of residences have been built, but large-scale housing construction is still needed to solve the problem of housing shortage in the capital. Now, new modern residences can be seen everywhere. Thousands of private residences built with state loans are springing up like mushrooms on the hills of Buda and in the scenic residential areas of the eastern suburbs. Thousands of houses that were once used as offices have been restored to their original use. Housing repair work is constantly underway. Residences and public buildings are being repaired inside and out to make Budapest's appearance more attractive.

    Today's Budapest has many achievements and is gradually solving various problems. The people of Budapest are filled with sincere confidence in the continuous development and prosperity of their city. For the first time in our lives, the city is managed by its own city council, democratically elected by the people, instead of a reactionary, bureaucratic city government hostile to the people. Today's city council sincerely cares about the interests of the citizens.

    For the first time in our lives, all the good things in Budapest are serving the working people. The "Red Star" Hotel, formerly only available to the powerful and wealthy, has become a place of rest for the working people, and today the Opera House attracts one million spectators every year.

    In the past ten years, the first ten years since liberation, Budapest has been rebuilt from a desolate ruin into a vibrant metropolis. In another ten years, Budapest will have even greater development, and Hungarian architects are drawing up new urban development plans. Thousands of new residences and brand-new residential areas with parks, playgrounds, and public health facilities will be built. At the same time, the traditional appearance of Budapest, which has been formed due to its location on both sides of the Danube and its historical development, will be preserved in future new developments. We will gradually eliminate the overcrowding caused by capitalist real estate speculation in some old urban areas. These old, air-polluted areas will be completely rebuilt, while buildings of historical significance and architectural value will be well preserved. The suburbs will continue to develop and rise to the level of the capital. A network of parks will surround the entire capital; sports fields will be opened on green lawns and in colorful flowerbeds. The area where the Buda hot springs are located will be developed into a hot spring resort.

    These are bold but realistic plans. The great achievements that Budapest has achieved since liberation are the best proof of the reality of these plans. In the past ten years, we have achieved a lot and we have made great strides forward. Now, we must not slacken our efforts. We will continue to move forward, continuing on the road to building the socialist capital of socialist Hungary.

    布达佩斯解放十周年
    布达佩斯市人民会议副主席  雅诺斯·巴伦雅伊
    我坐在布达佩斯市政大楼办公室里写这篇文章。从窗口望出去，可以看到街上熙熙攘攘的人流、琳琅满目的商店橱窗、咖啡店和点心铺的霓虹灯招牌。看着这愉快动人的景象我的思潮回溯到了我们美丽的首都十年前的样子：那时，它在希特勒德国占领军和匈牙利法西斯走狗的恐怖统治下，是一片荒凉。一九四五年二月里，苏联军队经过自我牺牲的浴血战斗解放了布达佩斯的时候，这个城市差不多是一无所有了。法西斯匪徒们炸毁了多瑙河上所有的桥梁。首都的住宅在城市被围困的时候，被破坏、炸毁了百分之七十四。到处残破的人行道上堆满了碎砖烂瓦和坦克的残骸。没有电、水或瓦斯。饥饿威胁着居民……
    在这样悲惨的情况下，需要对解放了的人民的力量和前途具有无限的信心，才能说出我们将重建布达佩斯、我们将使她变得比过去更大更美，这样充满了活力的话。匈牙利共产党就是这样说的！它的话鼓舞了布达佩斯的人民去重建自己的城市。自然，开始是很艰难的。要不是社会主义的苏联——布达佩斯的解放者——援助我们，严重的粮食和卫生问题，那些全部原料被抢光了的工厂恢复生产的问题，就会造成无法克服的困难。苏联政府给布达佩斯人民送来了粮食，给病人送来了药品。苏维埃的桥梁工程人员冒着寒冬的风暴，在多瑙河上修建起第一座便桥。接着，苏维埃的棉花、煤炭、铁矿和其它原料源源运到了布达佩斯的工厂，使它们恢复了生产。
    我们的新生活诞生以来，十年过去了。要概括我们解放以来所取得的成就，不是一件容易的事情。我们扫清了废墟，建筑了许多新的公共建筑物和住宅。在往昔被人遗忘的工人区，矗立起漂亮的光线充足的公共宿舍。在市内新建了许多公园和操场。修建了新剧院：像伊卡尔剧院、布达佩斯第二歌剧院和重建的现代化的人民军剧院。我们修建了可容十万观众的巨型的人民运动场——新的运动场建筑中最大的一个，还有许多小型的运动场。现在，布达佩斯有一百六十个足球场，四百一十个排球场，六十五个运动场和二百五十四个网球场。
    说举世闻名的布达佩斯十年来变得比过去更美丽了，是一点也不夸大的。但是，在城市的外貌底下，首都的日常生活的进展，有着更加重大的意义。
    住在布达佩斯郊外工人区的成千上万的人们的希望实现了。这些地方已经同首都联成一体，正在逐步地向中心住宅区的标准看齐。旧政权可耻地对郊区的交通、公用事业、公共卫生和文化设备置之不问。战前，布达佩斯有一百六十五万人。战时减到八十三万二千人。解放以来，人口逐年增加，现在已达到一百七十万人。
    十年来，这个迅速成长和壮大起来的城市，在经济、交通、文化和公共卫生方面都有了惊人的进展。如今，布达佩斯有炼铁厂、冶金工厂和机器工厂四百个，有三百五十个纺织厂，一百五十个化学工厂和好几百个食品工厂。布达佩斯旧有的大工厂，像以流线型车辆闻名的甘兹车辆工厂，以火车头制造闻名的马威格机器制造厂和享有二百年历史的高德伯尔格纺织厂等，都扩大了，增加了新的车间。同时，在这十年当中，在布达佩斯又新建了数十个工厂。
    布达佩斯的制造工业拥有巨大的生产能力。按照人民政权的计划，这些生产能力，正在越来越多地用于生产日用品，以提高人民的生活水平。我们的工厂正生产出比过去任何时候都多的上等纺织品、衣服、靴鞋和食品。重工业生产的调整腾出了某些过去主要是制造生产资料的工厂——特别是机器制造工厂的生产力。这些工厂现在正转入日用品的生产。布达佩斯的工厂正开始大批地出产电气洗衣机、冰箱、真空吸尘机、地板打蜡机、新式收音机和留声机等。这些产品正由百货公司和专业公司出售。
    建筑业也在竭力满足市民的需要，解决资本主义制度遗留下来的房荒问题。十年来，已修建了几千栋住宅，但是还要有大规模的住宅建设才能解决首都的房屋不足问题。现在，到处都可以看到新的现代化的住宅。用国家的贷款修建的数千幢私人住宅，正如雨后春笋般地一幢幢地出现在布达山坡上和风景秀丽的东郊住宅区里。数千幢曾用作办公室的房屋已恢复了原有的用途。房屋修缮工程一刻不停地在进行着。住宅和公共建筑从内到外修理得焕然一新，使布达佩斯的面貌更加吸引人了。
    今天的布达佩斯已有许多成就，并正在逐步解决各项问题。布达佩斯人民对自己城市的不断发展和繁荣，满怀着忠诚的信心。在我们的生活中，第一次经过民主选举出来的人民自己的市会议管理这个城市，而不再是同人民为敌的反动的官僚主义的市政府了。今天的市会议衷心地关怀着市民的利益。
    所有布达佩斯美好的东西都在为劳动人民服务，这还是我们有生以来第一次的事情。从前只许权贵享用的“红星”旅馆，现在成了劳动人民的休憩场所，今天的歌剧院每年都要吸引一百万观众。
    过去的十年，解放后的第一个十年，布达佩斯已从一片荒凉的废墟上重建成了生气勃勃的大都市了。再一个十年，布达佩斯将有更大的发展，匈牙利的建筑师们正在制订新的城市发展规划。几千幢新住宅和附有公园、操场、公共卫生设备的全新住宅区都要兴建起来。同时，布达佩斯因为位于多瑙河的两岸和它的历史发展而形成的传统面貌，将在今后新发展中保留下来。我们将逐步地清除由于资本主义制度的房产投机在某些旧市区造成的人口过于拥挤的现象。这些古老的空气混浊的地区将得到彻底的改建，而那些有历史意义和建筑艺术价值的建筑物，则会完好地保存下来。郊区将继续发展，并提高到首都的水平。一个公园网将把整个首都环绕起来；在茵绿的草地上和鲜艳的花圃中将开辟出运动场。布达温泉所在的地区将发展成为一个温泉疗养区。
    这些是大胆而又现实的计划。布达佩斯从解放以来所获得的巨大成就就是这些计划的现实性的最好的证明。过去十年中，我们已有了许多成就，我们大踏步的前进了。现在，我们更不能松劲。我们将继续前进，在建设社会主义的匈牙利的社会主义首都的道路上继续前进。
