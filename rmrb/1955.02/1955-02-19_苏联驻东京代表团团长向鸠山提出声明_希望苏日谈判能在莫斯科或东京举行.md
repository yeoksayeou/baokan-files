“On February 5th, the Japanese Permanent Observer to the United Nations, Ambassador Renzo Sawada, presented a note to the Soviet Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Sobolev, in which the Japanese government responded to the Soviet statement of January 25th.

“In the note, the Japanese government stated that it agreed with the Soviet government's proposal to exchange views on practical steps for normalizing Soviet-Japanese relations and was ready to negotiate on this issue. The Soviet government expresses its satisfaction with this statement.

“Therefore, from the perspective of the formal exchange of views between the two governments, negotiations on the normalization of Soviet-Japanese relations can effectively begin as soon as both parties reach an agreement on the location of the negotiations.

“The aforementioned note from the Japanese government suggests that the negotiations take place in New York.

“At the same time, the Soviet representative in Tokyo, Domnitsky, received notification on February 5th that the negotiations could be held in Tokyo. In addition, it can be known from a broadcast by Japanese radio on February 7th that the Japanese government indicated that the negotiations could be held in Moscow.
