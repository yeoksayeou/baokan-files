By the end of 1954, preliminary estimates indicate that there were still 2.41 million private merchant households in rural areas nationwide, comprising 3.5 million people, with a total circulating capital of 3.4 trillion yuan. Among these private merchants, excluding commercial capitalists and a small number of rich peasants engaged in business, who account for about 1.7 percent of the total, the vast majority are small vendors. This is a significant force indispensable to rural commercial activities and an important aspect of implementing socialist transformation in rural areas. The policy for transforming these small vendors is to organize them under the leadership and planning of supply and marketing cooperatives, following the principle of voluntarism, through various forms, enabling them to share the task of rural commodity circulation through the path of mutual aid and cooperation, and gradually transition into supply and marketing cooperative businesses. Party committees, government organs, state-owned commerce, and cooperative departments at all levels must actively lead this work, treating it as a major political and economic task in leading rural economic work and enlivening urban-rural trade.

Why is it necessary to actively lead the socialist transformation of rural small vendors? Aren't there already enough tasks in rural areas? Yes, rural work is indeed very heavy, especially after the implementation of unified purchase and sale, the situation has changed even more. In terms of rural commercial activities, the state and cooperative commerce purchased 70 percent of the total commodity volume of agricultural and sideline products in 1954, and the retail sales of production and consumer goods reached more than 60 percent of the total retail sales. Such heavy tasks have even overwhelmed state-owned and cooperative commerce, and the reduction in channels in the entire urban-rural exchange has led to a certain degree of stagnation, causing some difficulties in the economic life of the masses that could have been avoided. However, the number of employees in rural private commerce is more than three times that of state-owned and cooperative commercial employees in rural areas, but their business volume is decreasing day by day, leading to job changes, and those who fail to change jobs become unemployed, becoming a new economic burden on the state. This unreasonable phenomenon must be adjusted in order to revitalize rural economic life and urban-rural trade.

Rural small vendors have close ties with farmers, undertake part of the tasks of purchasing, distributing, and short-distance transportation, and have the habit of enduring hardship and hard work, being able to go deep into remote rural areas. This kind of labor has a wide impact and an important role in revitalizing the rural economy. If they can be organized, they can become a powerful assistant to state-owned and cooperative commerce, increase the channels of commercial circulation between urban and rural areas, meet the needs of urban and rural people, and greatly expand and consolidate the position and influence of socialist commerce in rural areas. As Stalin pointed out at the 13th Congress of the Russian Communist Party: "In order to consolidate ourselves in trade, it is not at all necessary to drive out the last small merchant in the last village, but only to turn each county into a base of Soviet commerce, so that all small merchants have to revolve around the cooperative-Soviet commerce of each county, just as the planets revolve around the sun." Of course, it must also be recognized that rural small vendors are numerous, operate in a decentralized manner, are without leadership and planning, and have great blindness. If they are allowed to develop freely, the destructive power is also very great. Therefore, it is necessary to actively strengthen leadership, give play to their positive role, and prevent and overcome their destructive role. This is also an issue that leadership organs at all levels must pay great attention to.

Why can't the transformation of rural small vendors be done by other methods, such as state capitalism or expropriation, but must go through the path of mutual aid and cooperation? This is because small vendors are different from both commercial capitalists and feudal landlords. Rural small vendors generally have no or only a small amount of capital, opening small-scale shops or peddling goods from a shoulder pole or setting up stalls for sale. They do not hire shop assistants or only hire a small number of shop assistants, and their entire or main source of livelihood comes from their own labor in commodity circulation. This means that small vendors are also working people in rural areas. Their commonalities with farmers and handicraftsmen are that they are both laborers and private owners, with characteristics such as being scattered, backward, and conservative, and are more susceptible to the speculative and opportunistic thinking of the bourgeoisie than farmers and handicraftsmen. But in any case, since they are laborers, this determines that they can gradually move towards socialism under the leadership of the working class. The socialist transformation of them should not adopt the method of expropriation, or the practice of forced displacement and replacement. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out in the report on the draft constitution: "Among the working people, in addition to workers and peasants, there are also a considerable number of urban and rural individual handicraftsmen and other non-agricultural individual laborers in our country. They live by labor, or mainly live by labor. The working class must unite these working people as well as it unites the peasants to jointly build socialism. Uniting these working people belongs to the scope of the worker-peasant alliance."

According to the experience of pilot projects in various places, the forms of organizing small vendors for mutual aid and cooperation can be roughly divided into the following types: distribution and management groups with socialist sprouts; cooperative groups and cooperative shops that are semi-socialist in nature, or joint ventures in productive industries; and agency sales (without self-operated businesses) that are socialist in nature. Regardless of this or that form, according to the preliminary experience of pilot projects in various places, there are great benefits after being organized: the scope of cooperative business has been expanded, the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and the primary market in rural areas have been revitalized, the enthusiasm of small vendors has been improved, their business activities have been incorporated into the cooperative's planned track, and through business activities, it is also more convenient for the cooperative to guide them to improve their business methods and strengthen their education. The Suburban Office of the Zhengzhou City Cooperative organized nine small vendors in Xushui Town to form a general merchandise cooperative group. Since starting business on January 1 this year, in just the first four days, the turnover increased by 138 percent compared with the total turnover of these vendors in the same period before being organized. After being organized, the enthusiasm of the vendors has been greatly improved. They sell goods at the market, carry goods to the countryside, and deliver goods with burdens even in heavy snow. In the past, farmers needed "hot goods," but private merchants could not buy them, and the cooperative had the goods but could not take care of selling them. After these were allocated to the cooperative group this time, 20,000 eyelets, 740 pieces of shoe leather, and 500 pairs of shoelaces were sold in four days. This not only expanded the business of the cooperative and met the needs of the masses, but also made these small vendors see that the cooperative's attitude towards them had changed, and they increasingly closely relied on the cooperative, actively and proactively asking the supply and marketing cooperative to lead them in the transformation.

Organizing rural small vendors is still a new task, and at the same time, this is only the beginning of their socialist transformation. Since this is a new task, many difficulties and obstacles will inevitably be encountered when starting the pilot program. Some cooperative cadres believe that all private merchants are capitalists, fearing that approaching private merchants means unstable positions, fearing that organizing private merchants will develop capitalism, fearing that developing wholesale business will reduce profits, so they generally do not value them, do not organize them, and even use various methods to squeeze them out; while some small vendors are afraid that life will be unaccustomed after being organized, and that it will be inconvenient to use money, some are afraid that the income will be less after being organized and they will suffer losses, and some are afraid that the local government will not lead them, and they will not be able to live if they collapse. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct in-depth policy education and ideological mobilization, take into account the various difficulties in practical work, advance steadily, and fully prepare for the pilot project, and patiently cultivate typical examples to set an example. Only in this way can this work be carried out smoothly. Since mutual aid and cooperation is only the beginning of the transformation of small vendors, after organizing them, it is also necessary to use great efforts to help them improve their business management, reasonably divide the scope of trade, supervise them to abide by various regulations and systems, and prevent behaviors such as adulteration, counterfeiting, and black market creation. At the same time, it is necessary to lead them in learning in a planned way, eliminate the capitalist business ideology of only seeking profit, establish the idea of serving agricultural production and obeying national leadership, and establish new business ethics of fair weighing, full measures, sufficient size, genuine goods at fair prices, and honesty to all. It must be recognized that the transformation of rural small vendors is an extremely complex task, and it should be placed on the important work agenda.

With the development of national economic construction, the increasing growth of industrial and agricultural production, the task of rural commercial work will inevitably become heavier and heavier day by day. Actively organizing the strength of small vendors and strengthening the leadership of rural commercial activities is the current urgent task of all rural workers, and it is also an important aspect of specifically implementing the general line of the transition period in rural areas. We must do this work well with all our efforts.

    经过互助合作道路，改造农村小商小贩
    截至一九五四年年底，全国农村私商初步估计还有二百四十一万户，三百五十万人，拥有流动资金三万四千亿元。在这批私商中，除了约占总人数百分之一点七的商业资本家和少数富农兼营商业者外，绝大多数都是小商小贩。这是农村商业活动中不可缺少的一个巨大的力量，也是在农村中实行社会主义改造的一个重要方面。改造这些小商小贩的方针，是根据自愿的原则，在供销合作社领导和计划下，通过各种形式加以组织，使它们经过互助合作的道路，分担农村商品流转的任务，并逐步过渡为供销合作社商业。各级地方党委、政府机关、国营商业和合作部门，必须积极领导这项工作，把它当作当前领导农村经济工作、活跃城乡贸易的一件重大的政治的和经济的任务。
    为什么要积极地领导农村小商小贩实行社会主义改造呢？农村的工作任务不是已经够多够重了吗？是的，农村工作的确十分繁重，特别是统购统销开始以后，情况变化更大。以农村商业活动来说，国家和合作社商业收购的农副产品在一九五四年达到了商品总量的百分之七十，出售生产资料和生活资料的零售额达到了零售总额的百分之六十以上，这样繁重的任务，甚至使国营和合作社商业简直忙不过来，整个城乡交流由于渠道减少发生一定程度的阻滞现象，使群众经济生活遇到一些本来可以避免的困难。可是，农村私商从业人员约为农村中的国营和合作社商业职工的三倍多，其营业额却日益减少，以致纷纷转业，转业未成的陷于失业，变成国家的新的经济负担。必须调整这种不合理现象，才能活跃农村经济生活和城乡贸易。
    农村小商小贩，他们和农民有着密切的联系，担负着一部分收购、分配和短距离运输的任务，并且具有吃苦耐劳的习惯，能够深入到偏僻乡村，这种劳动，对活跃农村经济有着广泛的影响和重要的作用。如果能把他们组织起来，就可以使他们成为国营和合作社商业的一个有力的助手，增加城乡间商业流转渠道，满足城乡群众需要，大大扩大和巩固社会主义商业在农村中的阵地和影响。正如斯大林在俄共第十三次代表大会上指出的：“为了在贸易方面巩固起来，完全没有必要把最后一个村庄最后的一个小商人都驱逐出去，而只有把每个县变为苏维埃商业的基地，使一切小商人都不得不围绕着每个县的合作社—苏维埃商业的周围而旋转，如同各行星绕着太阳转一样。”当然也必须看到，农村小商小贩人数众多，经营分散，无领导、无计划，有很大的盲目性，如果任其发展，破坏性也是很大的。因此又必须积极加强领导，发挥他们的积极作用，防止和克服他们的破坏作用。这也是各级领导机关必须十分重视的一个问题。
    为什么改造农村小商小贩不能用别的方法，例如通过国家资本主义的方法或采取剥夺的方法，而必须经过互助合作的道路呢？这就因为小商小贩既不同于商业资本家，也不同于封建地主的经营。农村小商小贩，他们一般是没有或仅有少量资本，开设小规模商店或肩挑叫卖和摆摊出售，不雇用店员或只雇用少数店员，以自己从事商品流转中的劳动为生活的全部或主要来源。这也就是说：小商小贩同是农村中的劳动人民。他们与农民和手工业者的共同之处，就是他们既是劳动者又是私有者，具有分散、落后、保守等特点，并且比农民和手工业者更容易接受资产阶级投机取巧的思想影响。但是无论如何，既然他们是劳动者，这就决定了他们可以在工人阶级领导下逐步走到社会主义，对他们的社会主义改造，就不应采取剥夺的办法，或硬性排挤代替的作法。正如刘少奇同志在关于宪法草案的报告中指出的：“在劳动人民中，除工人农民外，我国还有为数不少的城市和乡村的个体手工业者和其他非农业的个体劳动者，他们是依靠劳动过活的，或者是主要地依靠劳动过活的。工人阶级必须如同团结农民一样，很好地团结这些劳动人民共同建设社会主义。团结这些劳动人民，是属于工农联盟的范畴之内的。”
    组织小商小贩互助合作的形式，根据各地试点的经验，目前大体可分以下几种：带有社会主义萌芽性质的经销、经营小组；属于半社会主义性质的合作小组、合作商店，或在具有生产性的行业中的合营；以及社会主义性质的代购代销（不经营自营业务的）。不管这种或那种形式，根据各地试点的初步经验，组织起来以后都有很大好处：合作社业务范围扩大了，城乡物资交流和农村初级市场活跃了，小商小贩的积极性提高了，他们的经营活动纳入了合作社的计划轨道，通过业务活动，也更便利了合作社指导他们改进经营方法和加强对他们的教育。郑州市合作社郊区办事处在须水镇组织九户小商贩成立了一个百货业合作小组，从今年一月一日开始营业，只最初四天，营业额就比这些商贩组织起来以前在同一期间的总营业额增加百分之一百三十八。组织起来以后，商贩的积极性大大提高了，逢集售货，背集下乡，大雪天还挑担送货。过去农民们需要“热货”，私商买不到，合作社有货又顾不上卖，这次批给合作小组以后，四天就卖出二万个气眼、七百四十根鞋皮、五百付鞋带。这既扩大了合作社的业务，满足了群众的需要，而这些小商小贩看到合作社对自己的态度改变了，也日益紧密地靠拢合作社，主动积极地要求供销合作社领导他们进行改造。
    把农村小商小贩组织起来，这还是一个新的工作，同时，这也只是对他们进行社会主义改造的一个开端。由于这是一个新的工作，在开始试行的时候，就必然会碰到很多困难和阻碍。有些合作社的干部认为凡是私商都是资本家，怕接近私商就是立场不稳，怕组织私商发展了资本主义，怕开展了批发业缩小了利润，因而普遍地不重视他们，不组织他们，甚至用各种办法排挤他们；而小商小贩则有些怕组织起来生活不习惯、用钱不方便，有些怕组织起来后收入少、自己吃亏，有些怕当地政府不领导，垮了台没法生活。因此必须深入地进行政策教育和思想动员，照顾到实际工作中的各种困难，稳步前进，充分做好试办的准备工作，耐心地培养典型，做出榜样。只有这样，才能使这项工作顺利地进行。由于互助合作只是改造小商小贩的一个开端，因此把他们组织起来以后，就还要用很大力量去帮助他们改进经营管理，合理划分贸易范围，监督他们遵守各种章程制度，防止掺杂掺假、制造黑市等等行为，同时要有计划地领导他们进行学习，肃清资本主义唯利是图的经营思想，树立为农业生产服务和服从国家领导的思想，树立秤平、斗满、尺码足、货真价实、童叟无欺的新的商业道德。必须认识到，对农村小商小贩的改造是一件极其复杂的工作，应该把它摆在重要的工作日程上去。
    随着国家经济建设的发展，工农业生产的日益增长，农村商业工作的任务也势必一天一天加重，积极地组织小商小贩的力量，加强对农村商业活动的领导，这是全体农村工作者当前的迫切任务，也是在农村中具体贯彻过渡时期总路线的一个重要方面。我们必须用一切努力，做好这项工作。
