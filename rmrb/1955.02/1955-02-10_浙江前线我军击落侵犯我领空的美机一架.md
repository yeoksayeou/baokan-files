Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th: A People's Liberation Army anti-aircraft artillery unit on the Zhejiang front shot down a U.S. military plane that invaded our country's airspace.

At 10:29 AM on the 9th, two U.S. AD-type aircraft invaded the airspace over Jigu Mountain Island, Zhejiang Province, for circling provocation. They then invaded the airspace over Songmen Mountain Island, Longwangtang Mountain Island, Beigang Mountain Island, and Baiyan Mountain Island, and repeatedly carried out dive low-altitude strafing attacks on fishing boats near Songmen Mountain Island. The local People's Liberation Army anti-aircraft artillery unit immediately retaliated, seriously damaging one of the planes. At 10:50 AM, this damaged U.S. plane crashed into the sea southeast of Baiyan Mountain. The other invading U.S. plane fled east.

Sources here pointed out: In order to safeguard national sovereignty and security, the Chinese People's Liberation Army will resolutely strike at U.S. military aircraft that continue to violate our country's airspace despite repeated warnings from the Chinese people. The U.S. government must bear full responsibility for the consequences caused by its armed provocations.

    浙江前线我军击落侵犯我领空的美机一架
    【新华社北京九日讯】浙江前线中国人民解放军高射炮部队击落侵犯我国领空的美国军用飞机一架。
    九日十时二十九分，美国AD型飞机两架，侵入我国浙江省积谷山岛上空，进行盘旋挑衅。接着又侵入我松门山岛、龙王堂山岛、北港山岛和白岩山岛上空，并曾向我松门山岛附近的渔船连续进行俯冲低空扫射。当地的中国人民解放军高射炮部队当即予以还击，把其中的一架击成重伤，十时五十分，这架被击伤的美国飞机坠入白岩山东南的海中。另一架入侵的美国飞机向东逃去。
    此间人士指出：中国人民解放军为了维护国家主权和安全，对不顾中国人民一再警告而继续侵犯我国领空的美军飞机，必定予以坚决的打击。美国政府必须对自己的武装挑衅所引起的后果承担全部责任。
