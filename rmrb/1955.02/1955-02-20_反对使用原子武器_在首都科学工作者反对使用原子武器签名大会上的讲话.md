    Oppose the Use of Atomic Weapons
    ——Speech at the Signing Rally of Science Workers in the Capital Against the Use of Atomic Weapons
    Wu Yuzhang, Honorary Chairman of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Societies

    The purpose of scientific work is to seek welfare for the people. It is the glorious mission of scientists to contribute their wisdom to the people. The modern era is an era of rapid advances in scientific research. The discovery of atomic energy is a great achievement in scientific research, marking a new stage in mankind's mastery of nature.

    However, in the current stage of class struggle in human society, the U.S. imperialist aggressive clique has stolen the fruits of atomic energy research, engaging in atomic weapons blackmail and preparing to launch an atomic war in order to realize its vain attempt to dominate the world and enslave mankind. U.S. imperialism is using atomic weapons to threaten us to liberate our territory of Taiwan. The Chinese people will never be intimidated by the war cries of the U.S. imperialist warmongers, and all peace-loving people in the world resolutely oppose this criminal act. The World Peace Council's call for signatures against the use of atomic weapons is gaining widespread response. This movement will demonstrate the unwavering will of the people of the world to defend peace and will deal a severe blow to the U.S. imperialist plot to prepare for an atomic war.

    Facts have proven that science cannot be separated from politics. Our scientists should not only use their scientific research to serve national construction and the people's happiness, but also consciously study Marxism-Leninism, learn dialectical materialism and historical materialism to arm themselves, and actively participate in the just struggle to defend peace.

    The achievements of scientific research are always the common result of human wisdom. The U.S. imperialists' attempt to monopolize atomic weapons is impossible. Scientists from all countries have made certain beneficial contributions to the research of atomic energy. Soviet scientists have special achievements. The Soviet Union is committed to the peaceful use of atomic energy, has established the world's first atomic energy industrial power station, and has decided to provide our country and other people's democratic countries with assistance in atomic energy research. The Soviet Union's assistance encourages our scientists to make good achievements in atomic energy research.

    The U.S. imperialists' attempt to launch an atomic war shows that the aggressive clique is already at the end of its rope. Everyone knows that atomic weapons do have great destructive power and harm, but they are not impossible to defend against. We must mobilize the people of the whole country and the people of the world to stop the enemy's criminal plan. The people must thoroughly shatter the enemy's conspiracy. As Chairman Mao said: "If the imperialists launch a war of aggression, we and the people of the world will certainly wipe them off the face of the earth!"

    反对使用原子武器
    ——在首都科学工作者反对使用原子武器签名大会上的讲话
    中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会名誉主席　吴玉章
    科学工作的目的是为人民谋福利。为人民贡献自己的智慧是科学家的光荣使命。现代是科学研究突飞猛进的时代。原子能的发现是科学研究上的伟大成就，标志着人类掌握自然能力的新阶段。
    但是，在人类社会阶级斗争发展到现在的情况下，美帝国主义侵略集团却盗窃了原子能研究的成果，进行原子武器的讹诈，准备发动原子战争，以实现其独霸世界奴役人类的妄想。美帝国主义正在以原子武器来恐吓我们解放我国领土台湾。我国人民绝不会为美帝国主义战争贩子们的战争叫嚣所吓倒，全世界一切爱好和平的人民都坚决反对这个罪恶行为。世界和平理事会号召反对使用原子武器的签名正在获得普遍的响应，这个运动将表现出全世界人民保卫和平的不可动摇的意志，给予美帝国主义准备进行原子战争的阴谋以严重的打击。
    事实证明：科学是不能脱离政治的。我们的科学家不但要用自己的科学研究为国家建设和人民幸福服务，而且要自觉地学习马克思列宁主义，学习辩证唯物论和历史唯物论，以武装自己。积极参加保卫和平的正义斗争。
    科学研究的成绩总是人类智慧共同的成果。美帝国主义企图垄断原子武器是办不到的。各国的科学家为研究原子能都作出了一定的有益的贡献。苏联的科学家们有着特殊的成就。苏联致力于和平利用原子能的事业，建立了世界上第一个原子能工业电力站，并且决定给我国和各人民民主国家以研究原子能的帮助。苏联的帮助鼓舞我国的科学家将在原子能研究方面做出很好的成绩。
    美帝国主义企图发动原子战争，这是表明侵略集团已经日暮途穷。大家知道，原子武器固然有很大的破坏力和危害性，但是并不是不能防御的。我们要动员全国人民和全世界人民的力量，制止敌人的罪恶计划。人民一定要贯彻粉碎敌人的阴谋。正如毛主席所说的：“只要帝国主义发动侵略战争，我们和全世界人民就一定要将它们从地球上消灭干净！”
