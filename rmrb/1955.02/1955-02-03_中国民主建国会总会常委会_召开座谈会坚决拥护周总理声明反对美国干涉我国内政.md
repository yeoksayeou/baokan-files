    China Democratic National Construction Association Standing Committee
    Holds Symposium Firmly Supporting Premier Zhou's Statement Opposing U.S. Interference in China's Internal Affairs
   [Xinhua News Agency, February 2nd] The Standing Committee of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce held a symposium on February 1 to discuss the statement issued by Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai regarding the U.S. government's interference in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. The symposium was presided over by Huang Yanpei, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce. Among those present were Vice Chairmen Zhang Naiqi, Shi Fuliang, and Standing Committee members and members Xiang Shuxiang, Pu Jiexiu, Zhu Jisheng, Wang Guangying, Zi Yaohua, Yu Huancheng, Ling Qijun, and more than 40 others.
    Everyone at the meeting unanimously believed that Premier Zhou's statement expressed the solemn will and unshakable firm position of the 600 million Chinese people, and expressed firm support for Premier Zhou's statement. Many pointed out that the U.S. government's scheme to instigate the United Nations to carry out so-called "ceasefire" is a new trick by the U.S. government and its followers to interfere in China's internal affairs and divide China's territory. Our internal affairs brook no interference from others; we will never give up until we liberate Taiwan.
    The meeting unanimously agreed that the local organizations of the China Democratic National Construction Association should promptly organize members to discuss the current international tension caused by the U.S. government, and deeply study Premier Zhou's statement of January 24; every member should expand publicity among industrial and commercial circles, continue to expose the conspiracies of the U.S. government and its followers, and promote patriotism; they should heighten vigilance, strengthen unity, and smash all sabotage activities of the enemy; industrial and commercial members should, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, further actively accept socialist transformation, improve production and management, and support the great struggle to liberate Taiwan with concrete actions.

    中国民主建国会总会常委会
    召开座谈会坚决拥护周总理声明反对美国干涉我国内政
   【新华社二日讯】中国民主建国会总会常务委员会在二月一日召开座谈会，讨论周恩来总理兼外长发表的关于美国政府干涉中国人民解放台湾的声明。座谈会由民主建国会总会主任委员黄炎培主持，到会的有副主任委员章乃器、施复亮和常务委员、委员项叔翔、浦洁修、朱继圣、王光英、资耀华、俞寰澄、凌其峻等四十多人。
    大家在会上一致认为周总理的声明表达了六万万中国人民的庄严意志和不可动摇的坚定立场，表示坚决拥护周总理的声明。许多人指出，美国政府策动联合国进行所谓“停火”的诡计，是美国政府和其追随者干涉我国内政、割裂我国领土的新花样。我们的内政，决不容他人干涉；我们不解放台湾，决不罢休。
    会上一致认为：民主建国会的地方组织应及时组织会员座谈目前由于美国政府所引起的国际紧张局势，深入学习周总理一月二十四日的声明；每一个会员要在工商界中扩大宣传，继续揭破美国政府及其追随者的阴谋，发扬爱国主义精神；要提高警惕，加强团结，粉碎敌人的一切破坏活动；工商业者会员更要在中国共产党的领导下，进一步积极接受社会主义改造，改进生产经营，以具体行动，支援解放台湾的伟大斗争。
