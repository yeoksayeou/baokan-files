Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th: Farmers in Guangdong Province, excluding Hainan Island where spring plowing has already begun, are actively preparing for spring plowing. According to incomplete statistics from only eight counties, seventeen districts, and over nine hundred townships before the Spring Festival, farmers have accumulated over 104 million dan of various kinds of native fertilizer. Over six hundred key water conservancy projects and local small-scale farmland water conservancy projects throughout the province have generally commenced construction recently, with some projects already completed. The benefited area of these water conservancy projects reaches over six million mu. The work of improving sandy fields in the Pearl River Delta is proceeding intensely. Various new types of agricultural implements and commercial fertilizers supplied by the state to farmers are being transferred to rural areas in a steady stream. In addition, the plowing service provided by the Zhongshan Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station has ended, having plowed over 5,400 mu of paddy fields for local farmers and state-owned farms.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanning: Farmers in Guangxi Province are actively preparing for spring plowing; farmers in areas with better water sources have already begun to plow their fields.

While celebrating the Spring Festival, farmers in various counties are also accumulating fertilizer. Qitang Township in Baise County used to be a place lacking fertilizer. Under the leadership of the agricultural producers' cooperative, farmers throughout the township collected a lot of rice straw, leaves, weeds, and garbage, and used high-temperature fermentation methods to produce over 786,000 jin of fertilizer. Farmers along the coast of the Gulf of Tonkin are also flocking to shallow seas to dredge sea mud for fertilizer. The fertilizer accumulation campaign in various counties of the Guilin Special District has been widely launched. In the Greater Miao Mountain Autonomous Region, fifteen townships have started to build small-scale water conservancy projects; among them, the Hemu and Rongshui districts have built seven dams and one reservoir and one pond each, which can irrigate over 2,400 mu of land.

This year, farmers of all ethnic groups in Guangxi Province plan to expand the cultivated area by 1.2 million mu and strive to change 1.5 million mu of single-season rice fields into double-season rice fields. To this end, relevant departments are busy transporting and supplying early rice seeds, new-style walking plows, double-wheel double-share plows, chemical fertilizers, and bone meal and other materials. Several hundred agricultural technology promotion stations and ten new-style agricultural implement stations throughout the province will also provide farmers with assistance in production technology.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 4th: As soon as the snow melted, the spring plowing production activities of six state-owned mechanical farms, one hundred and thirty-seven local state-owned farms, and six agricultural machinery tractor stations in Henan Province began. The Bo'ai Mechanical Farm has plowed over 1,300 mu in four days. The land within the service area of the Xinxiang Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station in the Yellow River irrigation area has been irrigated once and will soon be plowed. The newly built Banqiao Mechanical Farm has purchased excellent varieties that can plant 3,000 mu of beans and 500 mu of millet, ready for sowing. Local state-owned farms are also drying seeds and exchanging good varieties with agricultural producers' cooperatives near the farms. Staff members of the Shangqiu Special District Farm are using large carts to transport fertilizer to the fields. They plan to apply 2,000 to 4,000 jin of fertilizer per mu to ensure a bumper harvest of spring-sown crops.

    河南各国营农场和拖拉机站开始春耕
    【新华社广州四日电】广东省除海南岛上已开始春耕外，其他各地农民正积极准备春耕。仅据春节前八个县又十七个区和九百多个乡的不完全统计，农民积有各种土肥一亿零四百多万担。全省六百多宗重点水利工程和各地的小型农田水利，近来已普遍动工，部分工程已经竣工。这些水利工程的受益面积达六百多万亩。珠江三角洲改良沙田的工作正在紧张进行。国家供应农民的各种新式农具和商品肥料等，正在源源地往农村调拨。此外，中山农业机器拖拉机站的代耕工作已经结束，共给当地农民和国营农场代耕稻田五千四百多亩。
    据新华社南宁讯：广西省农民正积极地准备春耕；水源较好地区的农民已开始翻耕田地。
    各县农民在欢度春节的同时也在积蓄肥料。百色县七塘乡原来是个缺乏肥料的地方，全乡农民在农业生产合作社带动下，采集很多稻秆、树叶、杂草和垃圾，用高温发酵方法制成了七十八万六千多斤肥料。东京湾沿海的农民还纷纷驾船到浅海里捞海底泥作肥料。桂林专区各县的积肥运动已广泛展开。大苗山苗族自治区有十五个乡已动工兴修小型水利；其中和睦和融水两区已修好水坝七处，水库、水塘各一个，可灌溉两千四百多亩田地。
      今年广西省各族农民计划扩大耕地面积一百二十万亩，争取把一百五十万亩单季稻田改变为双季稻田。为此，各有关部门正繁忙地调运和供应早稻种籽、新式步犁、双轮双铧犁、化学肥料和骨粉等物资。全省几百个农业技术推广站和十个新式农具站也将在生产技术上给农民以援助。【新华社郑州四日电】积雪刚刚融化，河南省六个国营机械农场、一百三十七个地方国营农场和六个农业机器拖拉机站的春耕生产活动就开始了。博爱机械农场四天当中，已耕一千三百多亩。引黄灌溉区新乡农业机器拖拉机站代耕范围的土地已经浇灌了一遍，即将开耕。新建板桥机械农场，购买了能种三千亩豆子和五百亩谷子的优良品种，准备播种。各地方国营农场也正在翻晒种籽，和农场附近农业生产合作社调换良种。商邱专署农场职工正用大车往地里运送肥料，他们准备每亩上两千斤至四千斤肥料，保证春播作物丰收。
