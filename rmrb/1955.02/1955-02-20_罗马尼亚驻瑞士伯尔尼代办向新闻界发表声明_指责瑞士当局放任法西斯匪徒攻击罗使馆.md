Xinhua News Agency, February 19th (From TASS, Paris, February 18th): News received here states that the Chargé d'Affaires of the Romanian People's Republic in Bern, Mr. Ştefan, issued a statement to the press, making it very clear that the Swiss authorities, particularly the police authorities, were completely indifferent and stubbornly avoided taking any serious measures against the fascist thugs who attacked the Romanian Embassy in Bern on the evening of February 14th.

Ştefan pointed out that ten minutes after the thugs broke in at 2:00 AM, he permitted a team of police to enter the embassy territory to arrest the criminals. Later, Ştefan repeatedly requested officials from the police station and the political department to intervene immediately, but despite his repeated requests, the police station did not take any steps.

It was not until several hours later that morning that the police entered the embassy territory, and even then, it was not to arrest the thugs, so the thugs stayed on the embassy premises for thirty-eight hours.

Ştefan said that these thugs were equipped with grenades, automatic weapons, and gas masks.

Xinhua News Agency, February 17th (From TASS, Paris): According to news from Bern, around 16:00 local time, three of the group of thugs who attacked the Romanian Embassy were escorted away from the embassy in police cars. Their faces were covered. One of the thugs was arrested on the morning of February 15th. Nothing is known so far about the fate of the remaining thugs.

The Romanian Chargé d'Affaires in Switzerland, A. Ştefan, and the embassy staff have reoccupied the building of the Embassy of the Romanian People's Republic in Bern.

    罗马尼亚驻瑞士伯尔尼代办向新闻界发表声明
    指责瑞士当局放任法西斯匪徒攻击罗使馆
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社巴黎十八日讯：这里接到的消息说，罗马尼亚人民共和国驻伯尔尼代办什多菲尔向新闻界发表了一个声明，十分清楚地说明，瑞士当局，特别是警察当局，完全不管不问，顽固地避免对二月十四日晚间袭击伯尔尼罗马尼亚公使馆馆址的法西斯匪徒采取任何认真的措施。
    什多菲尔指出，在清晨二时匪徒侵入后十分钟，他就允许派一队警察进入使馆领土来逮捕罪犯。后来什多菲尔一再要求警局和政治部官员立即过问，但是尽管他一再要求，警局还是不采取任何步骤。
    直到几小时以后的那天上午，警察才进入使馆领土，甚至在那个时候，也不是去逮捕匪徒的，因此匪徒在使馆馆址停留了三十八小时之久。
    什多菲尔说，这批匪徒带着手榴弹、自动武器和防毒面具等装备。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社巴黎十七日电：据伯尔尼消息，在当地时间十六时左右，袭击罗马尼亚公使馆的一群匪徒中有三个人已被用警车从公使馆押走。他们的脸被蒙起来。其中有一个匪徒是在二月十五日早上被捕的。关于其余匪徒的命运到现在为止还一无所知。
    罗马尼亚驻瑞士代办艾·什多菲尔和公使馆工作人员已重新占有了罗马尼亚人民共和国驻伯尔尼公使馆的房子。
