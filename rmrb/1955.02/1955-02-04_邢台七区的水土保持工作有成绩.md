    Achievements in Soil and Water Conservation in the Seventh District of Xingtai
    The soil and water conservation work in the seventh district of Xingtai County, Hebei Province, has achieved great results. This district has dense gullies and a lot of shifting sand. Every flood season, floods and sandflows often inundate many fertile fields and crops. In the spring of 1952, the district launched soil and water conservation work in the mountainous areas. In that year, many sand dams, water-slowing dams, and reservoirs were built throughout the district, resulting in a bumper harvest for the entire district, with an average yield per mu increasing by 40% compared to 1951. This greatly encouraged farmers' confidence in building the mountainous areas. Over the past three years, the district has built more than 2,400 water-slowing dams, flow-directing dams, and sand dams. It has also created more than 110,000 mu of water conservation forests and orchards on silted beaches and barren mountains, controlling floods and sandflows in more than 120,000 square meters of area, and blocking more than 500,000 cubic meters of shifting sand, greatly reducing disasters for the people in the mountainous and plain areas and ensuring agricultural abundance.

    邢台七区的水土保持工作有成绩
    河北省邢台县七区水土保持工作获得很大成绩。该区沟壑稠密，流沙很多，每到汛期，洪水流沙经常淹没很多良田和庄稼。一九五二年春天，该区开展了山区的水土保持工作。在这一年中，全区修筑了许多拦沙坝，缓水坝，蓄水池等工程，因而全区获得丰收，平均每亩产量比一九五一年增加了百分之四十。因而大大鼓舞了农民建设山区的信心。三年来该区共已建筑了缓水坝、顺水坝、拦沙坝等两千四百多座，又在淤沙滩和荒山上营造了十一万多亩水源林、果树林等，把洪水流沙控制在十二万多平方公尺的地方，拦住了流沙五十万多立方公尺，大大减少了山区平原人民的灾害，保证了农业的丰产。　		（顾英）
