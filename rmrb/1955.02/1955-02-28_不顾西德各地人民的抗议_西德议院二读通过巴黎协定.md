Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, February 27th: Despite widespread protests and demonstrations throughout West Germany and the resolute opposition of the entire German people during parliamentary discussions, the reactionary majority in the West German Federal Parliament, manipulated by the Adenauer group, brazenly approved the Paris Accords on the evening of the 26th. The accords, concerning the relationship between the three Western powers and the Bonn government, the continued stationing of foreign troops in West Germany, West Germany's entry into the Western European Union and NATO, and the Saar Agreement, were divided into four bills for separate second readings.

The Federal Parliament, on the 25th, after rejecting the Social Democratic Party's proposal to remove the second and third readings of the Paris Accords from the agenda, began debating the Saar Agreement. During the debate, not only did Social Democratic Party members express their opposition, but divisions also arose within the Adenauer coalition government parties and even within Adenauer's own Christian Democratic Union.

In his speech, Adenauer attempted to conceal the fact that the passage of the Saar Agreement would lead to the separation of the Saar from Germany, stating that for the sake of so-called "Western defense," he had to accept the Saar Agreement, whether he liked it or not.

Social Democratic Party member Momen said that the Saar Agreement only consolidated the division of the Saar and Germany.

Free Democratic Party member Becker stated that his party would vote against the Saar Agreement. He said that as war reparations, "we can pay (France) with money and materials, but not with land and people."

Refugee Party member Füller said in his speech that the majority of Refugee Party members would vote against the Saar Agreement. Christian Democratic Union member Walz also stated that he would vote against the government on the Saar issue.

On the 26th, the Federal Parliament continued to debate the other bills of the Paris Accords. Social Democratic Party member Kreisky gave a lengthy speech, exposing West German Finance Minister Schäffer's attempt to downplay the cost of rearming West Germany as stipulated in the Paris Accords. Kreisky pointed out that the cost of arming West Germany was much higher than the government claimed. This could lead to the ruin of the West German economy. Kreisky affirmed that arming West Germany was unnecessary. He said, "The Paris Accords will not only not strengthen West Germany's security, but on the contrary, will weaken West Germany's security."

Social Democratic Party parliamentary group deputy chairman Schmidt also emphasized that in the Paris Accords, Adenauer had not obtained full sovereignty for West Germany. Schmidt ridiculed the notion that Bonn could freely pursue an independent foreign policy.

At the meeting on the 26th, the reactionary majority in the Federal Parliament rejected some amendments to the Saar Agreement proposed by the Social Democratic Party and proposals to postpone the implementation of the Paris Accords until after new negotiations were held between Western countries and the Soviet Union.

The Federal Parliament then passed the four bills on approving the Paris Accords late at night.

Although Adenauer forced the Bonn Federal Parliament to pass the Paris Accords in the second reading, he could not eliminate the increasingly exposed divisions between the ruling parties and within his own party. United Press International pointed out in its report on the results of the second reading that the Bonn Federal Parliament was "divided and reluctant." The voting situation on the Saar Agreement particularly illustrated this. The Adenauer government controlled two-thirds of the votes in parliament, but the Saar Agreement was only passed by 264 votes in favor, 204 votes against, and nine abstentions. Although under pressure from Adenauer, most members of the Free Democratic Party and the Refugee Party still voted against the Saar Agreement together with the Social Democratic Party members, including the West German Minister of Justice, Nomeyer, a Free Democrat.

### 不顾西德各地人民的抗议  西德议院二读通过巴黎协定

    不顾西德各地人民的抗议
    西德议院二读通过巴黎协定
    【新华社二十七日讯】波恩消息：西德联邦议院在经过连续三天的激烈辩论后，在二十六日夜间把巴黎协定分成关于西方三国和波恩政府关系、外国军队继续留驻西德、西德加入西欧联盟和北大西洋集团和萨尔协定等四个法案分别进行二读表决。在阿登纳集团操纵下的联邦议院的反动多数不顾议会讨论期间遍及西德各地的抗议示威和全德人民的坚决反对，悍然批准了这些协定。
    联邦议院二十五日在否决了社会民主党提出的要求从议程中撤消巴黎协定的二读和三读的提案后，就在萨尔协定上展开了辩论。在辩论过程中，不仅社会民主党议员表示反对，而且在阿登纳联合政府各党派以至在阿登纳自己的基督教民主联盟内部，也发生了分歧。
    阿登纳在发言中企图掩饰通过萨尔协定就要使萨尔从德国分裂出去的事实，他表示为了所谓“西方防务”，无论喜欢与否，都要接受萨尔协定。
    社会民主党议员摩麦尔指出，萨尔协定只是巩固了萨尔和德国的分裂。
    自由民主党议员贝克尔表示他的党要投票反对萨尔协定。他说，作为战争赔偿，“我们可以（向法国）付出金钱和物资，但是不能付出土地和人民”。
    难民党议员菲勒尔在发言中表示难民党多数议员要投票反对萨尔协定。基督教民主联盟议员瓦尔兹也表示，他将在萨尔问题上投票反对政府。
    二十六日，联邦议院继续就巴黎协定的其他法案进行辩论。社会民主党议员克赖西希作了长篇发言，他揭露西德财政部长谢菲尔在发言中想把巴黎协定所规定的重新武装西德的费用说小的企图。克赖西希指出，武装西德的费用比政府所谈到的要多得多。这可能招致西德经济的毁灭。克赖西希肯定地说，武装西德是不必要的。他说，“巴黎协定不但不会加强西德的安全，而且相反，会削弱西德的安全。”
    社会民主党议会党团副主席施密特也着重指出，在巴黎协定里，阿登纳并没有使西德得到完全的主权。施密特嘲笑了那种认为波恩能自由地执行独立的外交政策的说法。
    在二十六日会议上，联邦议院反动多数否决了社会民主党提出的一些对萨尔协定的修正案和要求延期到西方国家同苏联举行新的谈判以后再实施巴黎协定的提案。
    联邦议院随后在深夜分别通过关于批准巴黎协定的四个法案。
    阿登纳虽然迫使波恩联邦议院二读通过巴黎协定，他却无法消除执政党派之间和他自己的党的内部日益暴露的分歧。合众社在报道二读表决结果的消息中指出，波恩联邦议院是“陷于分裂的和勉强的”。萨尔协定的投票情况特别说明了这一点。阿登纳政府在议会中控制着三分之二的票数，但是萨尔协定只以二百六十四票赞成对二百零四票反对和九票弃权被通过。自由民主党和难民党的大部分议员虽然处在阿登纳的压力下，但是仍然和社会民主党议员一起投票反对萨尔协定，其中包括西德政府司法部部长、自由民主党人诺梅耶。
