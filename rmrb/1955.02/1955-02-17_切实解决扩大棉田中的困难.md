The Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture sent personnel to Fenyang, Taigu, Yongji and other places in December last year to inspect the work of expanding cotton fields. Judging from the cotton planting plans in these areas, the planned cotton planting area this year has been significantly expanded, and agricultural departments at all levels and farmers have made some ideological and material preparations for expanding cotton fields. Fenyang, Taigu, and Yongji counties plan to plant 344,400 mu of cotton this year, an increase of 51,000 mu compared to last year. Yangcheng and other three townships in the new cotton area of Fenyang County plan to plant 16,000 mu of cotton this year, an increase of 4,100 mu compared to last year. Five agricultural cooperatives in this county plan to plant 860 mu of cotton, accounting for 32 percent of the cultivated land area, an increase of 35 percent over last year's cotton planting area. Chengzixiang, the old cotton area of Fenyang County, plans to plant 10,000 mu of cotton this year, accounting for 66 percent of the cultivated land area, an increase of 18 percent compared to last year. According to the understanding in these areas, the cotton planting plans of agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid groups this year are generally 19 to more than 70 percent higher than last year.

However, having a plan to expand cotton fields does not mean that we can sit back and relax. At present, there are still serious problems in expanding cotton fields in various places. If these problems are not solved promptly and properly, the plan to expand the cotton planting area this year will be impossible to realize.

What problems need to be addressed?

First, the serious problem that currently exists universally is the insufficient quantity and low quality of cotton seeds. According to statistics from ten counties including Pingyao, Wenshui, Jiexiu, Taigu, Fenyang, and Xiaoyi, only 2.58 million jin of cotton seeds have been prepared so far, which is still half of the planned requirement. Taigu County plans to plant 52,000 mu of cotton, requiring 630,000 jin of cotton seeds, but currently lacks 280,000 jin. As for the low quality of cotton seeds, it can be seen from the following examples: of the 30,000 jin of cotton seeds stored in the Yangcheng Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Fenyang County, degraded cotton seeds account for one-quarter, and blighted cotton seeds and those with diseases and pests account for 30 percent. The average germination rate of cotton seeds in Taigu, Yuci, Pingyao, Wenshui, Jiexiu and other counties is only 65 percent. The reasons for the low quality of cotton seeds are not only due to poor growth due to natural disasters, but more importantly, the lack of attention to seed selection and poor storage. The Wuling Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Wenshui County placed cotton seeds under the eaves of houses, and they have now become damp. The Dongcheng and Kengcheng Township Supply and Marketing Cooperatives placed cotton seeds on the open ground exposed to wind and rain due to the lack of warehouse facilities. Judging from the above situation, cotton planting areas must check the preparation of cotton seeds as soon as possible, and in accordance with the requirements of this year's cotton planting plan, mobilize cotton farmers to store a large amount of cotton seeds, organize cotton farmers to select seeds and pay attention to storage. Supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels should also prepare a certain amount of cotton seeds and distribute them to seed-deficient areas as soon as possible to ensure the supply of seeds for expanding cotton fields.

Second, the shortage of fertilizer in cotton fields is also quite serious. According to the inspection, from August to December last year, the fertilizer accumulated by five agricultural cooperatives, twenty mutual aid groups, and sixteen individual farmers in Yangcheng and Lujiachuang townships in Fenyang County only reached 30 percent of this year's planned fertilizer requirement, and 70 percent of the fertilizer has not yet been secured. The reasons for the fertilizer shortage are:
（一）Many cadres do not have a sufficient understanding of the importance of increasing fertilizer, and their leadership is generally superficial, so fertilizer accumulation work in most areas is left to its own devices; (二) Some cadres in some areas believe that fertilizer accumulation this year has increased compared to the past, and they are satisfied with the status quo and do not actively mobilize farmers to increase fertilizer accumulation; (三) Some cadres and masses believe that fertilizer sources have been exhausted and rely solely on commercial fertilizers; (四) Some mutual aid group members rely on solving the fertilizer problem after joining the cooperative because they want to build a cooperative. Therefore, it is necessary to educate farmers on these issues and quickly mobilize farmers to accumulate and manufacture fertilizer to solve the fertilizer shortage problem.

Third, some township cadres in some counties feel that there are difficulties in terms of land in realizing the plan to expand cotton fields. This issue must be resolved realistically. Fenyang Tiantun, Yangcheng and other townships adopted the following methods to solve the problem of cotton field land: (一) Reduce the area of ​​bean crops and retain the area of ​​high-yield crops. The bean field area in these two townships accounts for 36 percent of the cultivated land area. According to cadres' calculations, appropriately reducing the bean crop area will not have a significant impact on grain production. (二) Increase the area of ​​multiple cropping, but sufficient fertilizer is required. (三) Reclaim small pieces of wasteland.
（四）Cut off small field paths and take main roads to connect small pieces of land into large pieces. The Xiyangcheng Agricultural Cooperative originally had 29 field roads. Cutting off eight of them increased the cultivated land by 10.4 mu. Reclaiming seven small pieces of wasteland increased the cultivated land by 10 mu. Leveling gun emplacements and filling trenches increased the cultivated land by 20 mu. In this way, the total cultivated land increased by more than 40 mu, accounting for one-tenth of the cooperative's cultivated land. The whole cooperative can not only plant 25 mu more cotton, but also increase the area of ​​grain crops by 20 mu.

Fourth, according to last year's experience, cotton pre-purchase work should be coordinated in a timely manner. When cotton was pre-purchased last spring, cotton fields had already been sown, and some had sprouted. Cotton farmers used the pre-purchase deposits to buy daily necessities, and only a few used them to expand production investment. This year, the pre-purchase work should be completed before the end of March, so as to help cotton farmers arrange production and purchase production materials in a timely manner. Pre-purchase deposits do not necessarily have to be distributed in the form of production materials. The local government can organize agricultural cooperatives to sign production material supply contracts with supply and marketing cooperatives. Supply and marketing cooperatives can prepare more waterwheels, new agricultural tools, fertilizers, medicines, and improved varieties, so that cotton farmers can buy what they urgently need for production.

Cotton farmers in some areas have reported that the grain supply is not timely, the procedures are cumbersome, the grain adjustment is not good enough (lack of mung beans and bean noodles), and the oil supply is too small. They are afraid that they will not be able to buy grain if they plant more cotton. Therefore, grain supply work in cotton areas must be effectively improved.

    切实解决扩大棉田中的困难
    于志平
    山西省农业厅在去年十二月派员赴汾阳、太谷、永济等地检查了扩大棉田的工作。从这几个地区的植棉计划看，今年棉花种植面积计划都有显著的扩大，各级农业部门和农民群众在思想上、物质上对扩大棉田也有些准备。汾阳、太谷、永济三县计划在今年植棉三十四万四千亩，比去年增加五万一千亩。汾阳县的新棉区阳城等三个乡今年计划植棉一万六千亩，比去年增加四千一百亩。这个县五个农业社计划种棉八百六十亩，占耕地面积百分之三十二，比去年植棉面积增加百分之三十五。汾阳县的老棉区城子乡今年计划种棉一万亩，占耕地面积百分之六十六，比去年增加百分之十八。据在这些地区了解，农业社和互助组今年的植棉计划一般都比去年增加了百分之十九至七十多。
    但是，有了扩大棉田的计划，决不能说就可以高枕无忧了。目前各地在扩大棉田方面还存在着严重的问题，如不及时妥善地给以解决，今年扩大种棉面积的计划势将无法实现。
    需要注意解决哪些问题呢？
    第一、目前普遍存在的严重问题是棉籽数量不足，质量又低。据平遥、文水、介休、太谷、汾阳、孝义等十个县统计，现在仅备妥棉籽二百五十八万斤，跟计划需要比较，仍差一半。太谷县计划植棉五万二千亩，需棉籽六十三万斤，目前还缺二十八万斤。至于棉籽质量低劣的情况，可以从下面的例子看出来：汾阳县阳城乡供销社存有的三万斤棉籽中，已退化的棉籽占四分之一，秕籽、有病虫害的棉籽占百分之三十。太谷、榆次、平遥、文水、介休等县棉籽发芽率平均只有百分之六十五。棉籽质量低的原因，除因受自然灾害生长不好以外，更重要的是不重视选种，而且保管不好。文水县武陵乡供销社把棉籽放在房檐下，现已发潮；东城、坑城两乡供销社因无仓库设备，把棉籽放在露天地上任风吹雨淋。从上述情况看来，植棉地区必须及早检查棉籽准备工作，并根据今年植棉计划的要求，发动棉农大量储备棉籽，组织棉农选种和注意保管。各级供销社也应准备一定数量的棉籽，及早分发到缺籽地区，保证扩大棉田的种籽供应。
    第二、棉田缺肥的情况也是相当严重的。根据检查，汾阳县阳城、潞家庄三个乡的五个农业社、二十个互助组、十六户个体农民从去年八月到十二月，所积肥料只达今年计划需肥量的百分之三十，还有百分之七十的肥料没有着落。缺肥的原因是：
  （一）不少干部对增加肥料的重要性认识不足，领导一般化，大部地区积肥工作形成自流；（二）部分地区干部认为今年积肥比过去已有所增加，满足现状，不积极发动农民增积肥料；（三）有些干部和群众认为肥源已经枯竭，单纯依赖商品肥料；（四）有些互助组组员因为要建社，便依赖入社后解决肥料问题。因此，必须针对这些问题，向农民进行教育，迅速发动农民积肥造肥，解决缺肥问题。
    第三、有的县部分乡干部感到实现扩大棉田计划，在土地方面有困难。这个问题必须实事求是地加以解决。汾阳田屯、阳城等乡解决棉田土地问题时，采取了下面一些办法：（一）缩小豆类作物面积，保留高产作物面积。这两个乡豆田面积占耕地面积百分之三十六，据干部计算，适当缩小豆类作物面积，对粮食增产影响不大。（二）增加复播面积，但需有足够的肥料。（三）开垦小片荒地。
  （四）截田间小路，走大路，使土地小片连大片。西阳城农业社的田间原有道路二十九条，截去八条，就增加耕地十亩四分，新开小片荒地七块，增加耕地十亩，平炮垒、填战壕增加二十亩，这样共增加耕地四十多亩，占全社耕地十分之一，全社不但能多种二十五亩棉花，而且增加了二十亩粮食作物面积。
    第四、根据去年的经验，棉花预购工作应及时配合。去年春天预购棉花时，棉田已下种，有的已出苗，棉农把预购订金都用到买生活资料上去了，只有少数用于扩大生产投资。今年预购工作最好在三月底以前结束，以便及时地帮助棉农安排生产，购买生产资料。预购订金不一定用生产资料来发放，可由当地政府组织农业社同供销社订立生产资料供应合同，供销社可多准备一些水车、新式农具、肥料、药械、良种等，让棉农买到他们生产上急需的东西。
    有些地区的棉农反映：粮食供应不及时，手续繁多，粮食调剂不够好（缺绿豆和豆面），食油供应太少。他们害怕多种了棉花买不到粮食。因此，棉区粮食供应工作必须切实改进。
