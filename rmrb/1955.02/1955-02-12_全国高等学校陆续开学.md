Following a two-week vacation, teachers and students in universities and colleges across the country have gradually begun their new semester of teaching and learning activities starting from the 7th.

The first-year students who entered universities and colleges in the autumn of 1954 have completed their first semester of studies and are now continuing to study foundational courses. Some graduating students from higher technical schools will depart for relevant factories and mines around the start of the new semester to undertake five to seven weeks of graduation internships. During these internships, they will gather materials for their graduation designs and return to school to complete their designs. Graduating students in arts and science disciplines have also selected their topics and will complete their graduation theses this semester. Second- and third-year students from various types of universities and colleges, after completing a stage of theoretical study this semester, will proceed to factories, mines, construction sites, farms, hospitals, etc., for practical production experience.
