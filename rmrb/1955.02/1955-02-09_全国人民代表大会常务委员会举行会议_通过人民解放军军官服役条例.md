    Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Holds Meeting
    Passes Regulations on the Service of Officers of the People's Liberation Army
   [Xinhua News Agency, 8th] The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress held its sixth meeting on February 8th.
    The meeting first discussed the "Regulations on the Service of Officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army." During the discussion of these regulations, Xu Liqing, Deputy Director of the General Cadre Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, who attended the meeting, made an explanation. Xu Liqing pointed out in his explanation that, in order to safeguard national security and defend peace in the Far East and the world, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is accelerating its regularization and modernization, and is changing from a voluntary military service system to a compulsory military service system; the officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army must take military work as their long-term or even lifelong career. In order to adapt to these new circumstances, it is necessary to make clear provisions on various issues related to the service of officers by means of regulations. These regulations are drafted based on the principle of implementing compulsory military service, based on the current actual situation of the People's Liberation Army, and with reference to the relevant laws and decrees of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries regarding the service of officers. During the drafting process, opinions were solicited from all parties and many revisions were made, and then the State Council discussed and approved it before submitting it to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for review.
    Xu Liqing then explained several main issues in the regulations. When talking about the qualifications and sources of officers, he pointed out that the regulations stipulate that active-duty officers must generally have received training in military schools or certain training classes. This is because every officer serving in a modern, regularized revolutionary army, in addition to having a certain level of culture and politics, must also have a certain level of military science, knowledge of modern warfare, and the ability to master modern military technology; otherwise, they will not be able to fulfill the duties of an officer. Regarding the issue of military ranks for officers, he said that the military rank of an officer is conferred by the state based on the officer's current position, political qualities, professional ability, experience in the military, and contribution to the revolutionary cause, and is an honor given to the officer by the state; the implementation of the military rank system can not only strengthen the army's organization and discipline, but also encourage officers to constantly improve themselves. Xu Liqing then gave specific explanations on the various provisions regarding the rights and obligations of officers in the regulations. Finally, when talking about the provisions regarding the reserve officer system in the regulations, he said that only by establishing a reserve officer system and maintaining a sufficient reserve officer force can the number of active-duty officers be relatively reduced during peacetime, reducing the country's financial burden; and once the country is subjected to armed aggression, officers needed by the army can be immediately replenished.
    After detailed discussion, the meeting passed the "Regulations on the Service of Officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army."
    Finally, the meeting passed several decisions on appointments and removals.

    全国人民代表大会常务委员会举行会议
    通过人民解放军军官服役条例
   【新华社八日讯】全国人民代表大会常务委员会在二月八日举行第六次会议。
    会议首先讨论“中国人民解放军军官服役条例”。在讨论这个条例时，列席会议的中国人民解放军总干部部副部长徐立清作了说明。徐立清在说明中首先指出：中国人民解放军为了保卫国家的安全，保卫远东和世界和平，正在加速进行正规化、现代化的建设，并由志愿兵制改变为义务兵役制；中国人民解放军的军官则要以军队工作为其长期的甚至是终身的职业。为了适应这些新的情况，就需要对有关军官服役的各项问题用条例作出明确的规定。这个条例是根据实行义务兵役制的原则，根据人民解放军目前的实际情况，并参照苏联和各人民民主国家有关军官服役的法令而草拟的。在起草过程中曾征求了各方面的意见，作了多次修改，然后由国务院讨论通过提请全国人民代表大会常务委员会审查。
    徐立清接着对条例中的几个主要问题作了说明。他在谈到关于军官的条件和来源问题时指出：条例中关于现役军官一般必须在军事学校或一定的训练班受过训练的规定，是考虑到在现代化、正规化的革命军队中服务的每一个军官，除了必须具有一定的文化水平和政治水平之外，还必须具有一定的军事科学水平、现代战争的知识和掌握现代军事技术的能力，否则就不能胜任军官的职务。关于军官的军衔问题，他说：军官的军衔是国家根据军官的现任职务、政治品质、业务能力、在军队中服务的经历和对革命事业的贡献授予的，是国家给予军官的荣誉；实行军衔制度不仅可以加强军队的组织性和纪律性，而且可以鼓励军官不断上进。徐立清接着对条例中关于军官的权利和义务问题的各项规定作了具体说明。最后，他在谈到条例中有关军官预备役问题的规定时说：只有建立军官预备役，保持了充足的军官预备力量，才可能在平时相对地减少现役军官的数量，减轻国家的财政负担；而在一旦国家受到武装侵略时，便立即可以补充军队所需要的军官。
    会议经过详细讨论以后，通过了“中国人民解放军军官服役条例”。
    会议最后通过了决定任免的事项多起。
