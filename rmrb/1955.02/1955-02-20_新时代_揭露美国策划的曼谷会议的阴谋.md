    "New Era" Exposes US Plot of Bangkok Conference
    (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 19th) TASS, Moscow, February 18th: The latest issue of the "New Era" magazine published an article by Ye. Zhukov, Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, commenting on the upcoming conference in Bangkok.
    The article says: On February 23rd, the so-called meeting of the participating countries of the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" will begin in Bangkok, the capital of Thailand. It is known that the countries that participated in the conclusion of this aggressive treaty in Manila in September 1954 were the United States, Britain, France, Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Thailand, and the Philippines.
    The author pointed out that the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" was pieced together based on the initiative and pressure of American diplomats. The author wrote: The planners of the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" attach great importance to the Bangkok conference. This is sufficiently confirmed even by the fact that the foreign ministers of the above-mentioned eight countries, as well as their senior military personnel, are participating in the conference. It is clear from US newspaper reports that Washington intends to use the upcoming Bangkok conference to escalate international tensions and plot military adventures against the people of Asia.
    At the Bangkok conference, the most important thing is to formulate measures that, according to US newspapers, can be used to make the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" a treaty "with teeth." According to the "New York Times," this work will begin with the establishment of a permanent secretariat of the Council of Foreign Ministers, and then gradually form a set of institutions for the Joint Command of the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty." It is expected that the "mobile force" insisted on by Dulles will be handed over to the Joint Command.
    The author asked: Who will the "mobile force" of the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty" threaten? This question was answered in Dulles' report to Eisenhower, published last November, regarding the interpretation of the clauses of the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty." The report emphasized that the purpose of the treaty is to oppose so-called "internal subversion." The report also stated: "The treaty recognizes the threat of subversion and indirect aggression."
    Any situation occurring "within the area covered by the treaty" that Dulles deems sufficient to threaten the existing regimes in those areas can be called "indirect aggression." It is not difficult to see that the purpose of this argument is to legitimize any interference by the United States in the internal affairs of Asian countries under the pretext of taking measures against "indirect aggression." The actual actions of the Washington diplomatic authorities prove that it is prepared to attach the label of "indirect aggression" to any action by the people to protect their national and social rights. Even an election in a certain country can be labeled "indirect aggression" as long as the result of such an election does not meet the wishes of the US ruling clique.
    The author continued, the British ruling clique is not happy with the US plan to establish a military institution for the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty." London understands very well that the initiator and leading force of the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty"—the United States—will never be enthusiastic about maintaining the British colonial empire. American imperialism is making every effort to establish its own world colonial empire, and it considers the ruins of the colonial empires of Britain, France, and other Western European countries to be the most suitable material for its plans. Washington pieced together the Southeast Asia group to implement its aggressive plans for Asia. It wants to use the new military group it has formed and its armed forces to serve its own interests exclusively.
    The article concludes by saying that the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty," which is full of ambitions to strangle the national liberation movement in Asia and is clearly aimed at the People's China, was planned single-handedly by the reactionary forces of the United States. However, the fact that Britain and France participated in the establishment of this aggressive military alliance also shows that the monopoly capital groups of other imperialist countries harbor the same purpose.
    The goal of these imperialist countries colluding with each other in Asia is to restore the colonial system. However, this is an impossible goal. Now, there is no way to restore the position that the imperialists have lost in Asia. Worthless threats cannot help them "put teeth" into the "Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty."

### “新时代”揭露美国策划的曼谷会议的阴谋

    “新时代”揭露美国策划的曼谷会议的阴谋
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：最近一期的“新时代”杂志刊载了苏联科学院通讯院士叶·朱可夫的一篇文章，评论即将在曼谷召开的会议。　　文章说：二月二十三日，在泰国的首都曼谷，将开始举行所谓“东南亚集体防务条约”参加国的会议。大家知道，在一九五四年九月在马尼拉参加缔结这个侵略性条约的国家有美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚、新西兰、巴基斯坦、泰国和菲律宾。
    作者指出：“东南亚集体防务条约”是根据美国外交家的倡议并且在他们的压力下拼凑成功的。作者写道：“东南亚集体防务条约”的策划者十分重视曼谷会议。即使从下面这个事实就足以证实这一点：参加会议的是上述八个国家的外交部长，以及它们的高级军事人员。从美国报纸的报道中可以明显地看出，华盛顿打算利用即将召开的曼谷会议来加剧国际紧张局势和策划反对亚洲人民的军事冒险。
    在曼谷会议上，最重要的是拟定一些按照美国报纸的说法是能借以使“东南亚集体防务条约”成为“装上牙齿”的条约的措施。据“纽约时报”说，这项工作将从成立外长理事会常设秘书处开始，然后再逐渐形成“东南亚集体防务条约”联合司令部的一套机构。预料将把杜勒斯坚持主张建立的“机动部队”交给联合司令部指挥。
    作者问道：“东南亚集体防务条约”的“机动部队”将会威胁谁呢？在去年十一月公布的杜勒斯致艾森豪威尔的报告中对于“东南亚集体防务条约”的条款所作的解释就回答了这一个问题。报告着重说，条约的目的是反对所谓“内部颠覆活动”。这个报告还说：“条约认识到颠覆活动和间接侵略的威胁。”
    在“条约所包括的地区”内发生的，只要是杜勒斯认为足以对那些地区的现有政权造成威胁的任何情况都可以被称为“间接侵略”。不难看出，这种论断的目的，是要使美国在采取措施反对“间接侵略”的借口下对亚洲国家内政所进行的任何干涉合法化。华盛顿外交当局的实际行动证明：它准备把人民群众保护自己民族权利和社会权利的任何行动，都安上“间接侵略”的罪名。甚至某一个国家进行的选举也能加上“间接侵略”的罪名，只要这种选举的结果不合美国统治集团的心愿。
    作者继续说，英国统治集团对于美国建立“东南亚集体防务条约”军事机构的计划并不感到欢喜。伦敦十分明白：“东南亚集体防务条约”的倡议者和领导力量——美国绝不会对于维护英殖民帝国的主张表示热心。美帝国主义正在竭力建立自己的世界殖民帝国，它认为英国、法国和其他西欧国家这些殖民帝国的断垣残壁是它进行这种打算的最适合的材料。华盛顿拼凑东南亚集团的目的是要实行它对亚洲的侵略计划。它是要利用它所组成的新的军事集团及其武装力量专门为自己的利益服务。
    文章最后说：充满了扼杀亚洲民族解放运动野心的、矛头明显地针对着人民中国的“东南亚集体防务条约”，是美国反动势力一手策划的。但是，从英国和法国参加建立这个侵略性军事同盟这个事实中，也可以看出其他帝国主义国家的垄断资本集团也怀抱着同样的目的。
    这些帝国主义国家在亚洲互相勾结一起的目标，就是恢复殖民制度。但是，这是一个不可能实现的目的。现在，再也没有任何办法能恢复帝国主义者们在亚洲所丧失的地位。一文不值的威胁一点也不能帮助他们给“东南亚集体防务条约”“装上牙齿”。
