    浙江前线我军又释放百余名被俘的蒋贼军
    【新华社浙江前线十九日电】浙江前线中国人民解放军某部在二月十七日又释放了第五批在一江山岛战斗中被俘的蒋贼军官兵。这批被释放的俘虏共有一百六十一人，其中除三名家居福建外，都是浙江省人。
    释放时，人民解放军某部曾举行了欢送大会。解放军代表和当地人民政府代表都在会上讲了话，勉励他们回家后积极参加生产建设。
    原蒋贼军士兵郭丁信代表被释放的人员在会上讲话。他首先感谢中国人民解放军对他们的宽大待遇，并揭露了蒋贼军的欺骗宣传和各种暴行。他最后说：“我们马上就要回家和亲人团圆了，我们一辈子也忘不了解放军的恩情，我们回家以后一定努力学习，积极生产，把自己改造成为新人。”
    会后，解放军部队给他们发了释放证书和路费，并进行了会餐。在临行时，所有被释放的俘虏都非常激动，很多人都握着解放军工作人员的手，久久不放。他们说：你们真是我们的救命恩人。
