Shanghai and Wuhan people are increasing their savings in banks year by year.
Last year, people in urban and rural Liaoning saved a total of more than 450 billion yuan.

    The savings capacity of the people of Shanghai is increasing day by day. In recent years, the average annual increase in savings deposits of the people of Shanghai has been nearly double that of the previous year. This is completely different from the situation before liberation, when people in the inflationary frenzy favored "heavy goods over currency." Now, the time people keep money in the bank is also increasing year by year. The average deposit period in 1954 was more than 100 days longer than in 1951. At the end of January this year, there were more than 1.1 million savings account holders in Shanghai. This number does not include lottery savings and fixed-amount savings account holders.
    Shanghai workers have become important bank depositors. They say: In the past, they went to pawnshops; now, they go to banks. At the end of 1954, the balance of savings deposits in Shanghai's seven factory districts was nearly 500 billion yuan. Currently, there are 77 banking institutions in these seven districts that specialize in savings business. At the end of January this year, Shenxin Textile Factory No. 9 had nearly 7,000 customers with both fixed and current savings accounts. In recent months, the average amount of lottery savings deposited by workers in this factory each month was more than 30,000 yuan per person. (Xinhua News Agency)
    According to the Wuhan Branch of the People's Bank of China's statistics on February 10th, the people of Wuhan City have more than 360 billion yuan more in current and fixed deposits in the People's Bank of China than in the same period last year. The total amount of current and fixed deposits is almost equal to the funds for building three Han River railway bridges. The most significant increase in deposits comes from the working people. At the end of last year, the number of fixed and current savings accounts at the Wuhan Branch of the People's Bank of China increased by 70,000 compared with the first quarter of last year, of which about 50,000 were working people. On average, one in every three workers and staff members of five yarn factories, including Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory, Hankou No. 1 Textile Company, Yuhua Textile Company's E Factory, Zhenhuan Textile Company, and Shenxin Yarn Factory, had a bank deposit. More than 80 of the 90 or so families of shipping workers and other working people living in the Customs Garden in Hankou have bank deposits, including many veteran seamen who often couldn't get enough to eat or wear before liberation. Housewives not only save the extra money from their monthly expenses but also deposit the money for buying groceries and making clothes into the bank for use at any time. Residents of the Customs Garden save 6 million yuan in living expenses each month. Fan Shizhen, a family member of a seaman, told reporters: "Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, my husband and I deposited more than 2,000 silver dollars, which we had worked hard to save, into the bank of the Kuomintang reactionary government. Later, what we withdrew was counterfeit money that depreciated every day. My husband was so anxious that he vomited blood, and in the end, this hard-earned money was not enough to pay for hospital expenses. Now that prices and currency values are stable, I convert my unused current deposits into fixed deposits every month." A few days ago, Fan Shizhen withdrew more than 70,000 yuan in deposit interest, which was enough to buy 60 or 70 kilograms of rice, more than her family could eat in a month. (Xinhua News Agency)
    The broad masses of urban and rural working people in Liaoning Province are storing large amounts of Renminbi in the People's Bank. At the end of 1954, the total amount of savings in the province reached 459.8 billion yuan, nearly six times more than in 1950. Among them, the savings of urban workers accounted for a large proportion. According to statistics from the Xingshun Street Branch of the People's Bank of China in Shenyang, workers participating in savings account for more than 97% of the total savings accounts. In 1953, only 100 to 200 employees of the Shenyang Chemical Plant participated in savings, and the largest amount of savings in a single month was only 18 million yuan. By 1954, the number of savers had increased to 700 to 800, and the amount of savings had also increased to more than 110 million yuan in a single month. More and more farmers are also participating in savings. In 1954, the amount of farmers' savings increased by more than 390% compared with 1953.
    People's views on money have undergone great changes. Li Weilian, an old woman in the Nanshi District of Shenyang City, bought 24 silver dollars with counterfeit currency during the Kuomintang rule and has kept them for more than ten years. The fact that prices have been stable in recent years has gradually made Li Weilian realize that saving silver dollars is not as good as saving Renminbi. She now sells her silver dollars for Renminbi and deposits it in the bank. She said: "Firstly, it is good for national construction, and secondly, I can get some interest from saving."

    上海武汉人民在银行的储蓄金额年年增多
    辽宁城乡人民去年共储蓄四千五百多亿元
    上海人民储蓄能力日益增加。这几年上海人民储蓄存款平均每年较上一年增加近一倍。这和解放前人民在通货膨胀的狂涛里“重货轻币”的情况，全然不同了。现在人民把货币存在银行里的时间也在逐年延长，一九五四年的平均存期比一九五一年多一百多天。今年一月底，上海储户已达一百一十多万户，这个数目尚不包括有奖储蓄和定额储蓄的储户。
    上海工人已成为银行的重要储户。他们说：过去跑当铺，如今进银行。一九五四年底，上海七个工厂区的储蓄存款余额已近五千亿元。目前，这七个区有七十七个专门办理储蓄业务的银行机构。在今年一月底，申新纺织第九厂定期、活期两种储蓄的储户就已近七千户。近几个月，这个厂的工人每月存入有奖储蓄的金额，平均每人有三万多元。（新华社）
    据中国人民银行武汉分行二月十日统计，武汉市人民在人民银行的活期和定期存款比去年同期多三百六十多亿元。活期和定期存款总数差不多等于建设三座汉水铁桥的资金。存款增加得最多的是劳动人民。去年年底，中国人民银行武汉分行的定期、活期储蓄户比去年第一季度增加七万户，其中劳动人民占了五万户左右。国营武汉第一棉纺织厂、汉口第一纺织公司、裕华纺织公司鄂厂、震寰纺织公司和申新纱厂等五个纱厂的工人、职员，平均每三个人中就有一个人在银行存了款。住在汉口海关花园的九十多家航运职工家属和其他劳动人民，有八十多家在银行存了款，其中有不少人是解放前经常吃不饱、穿不暖的老海员工人。家庭主妇们不但按月把开支外多余的钱储蓄起来，连买小菜、作衣服的生活待用款也存入银行，随时取用。海关花园的居民每月储蓄的生活待用款达六百万元。海员家属范士珍对记者说：“抗日战争以前，我和丈夫曾经把辛辛苦苦积存的两千多块银元存入国民党反动政府的银行，后来取出来的是天天贬值的伪币，我丈夫急得吐血，结果这笔血汗钱还不够住医院。现在物价、币值稳定，我每月都把用不完的活期存款转为定期存款。”前几天范士珍取出七万多元存款利息，这笔利息够买六、七十斤大米，她一家人一个月也吃不完。　（新华社）
    辽宁省广大城乡劳动人民把大量人民币储存到人民银行里。一九五四年年末，全省储蓄总额达四千五百九十八亿元，比一九五零年增加近六倍。其中城市职工储蓄额占的比重很大。据中国人民银行沈阳市兴顺街分理处统计，职工参加储蓄的占总储蓄户百分之九十七强。沈阳化工厂一九五三年参加储蓄的职工只有一、二百人，储蓄金额最多的一个月份才一千八百万元：到了一九五四年，储蓄人数就增加到七、八百人，储蓄金额也增加到一个月份一亿一千多万元。农民参加储蓄的也越来越多了。一九五四年农民储蓄额比一九五三年增加了百分之三百九十多。
    人民对货币的看法发生了很大变化。沈阳市南市区李维廉老大娘在国民党统治时代用伪币买了二十四块银元，已保存上十年了。近几年来物价一直很平稳的事实，使李维廉老大娘逐渐感到保存银元不如保存人民币。她现在把银元变卖成人民币存在银行里。她说：“一来对国家建设有好处，二来我自己还可以因为储蓄得到一些利息。”
