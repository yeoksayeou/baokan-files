    Welcome Liu Ruolong and Song Baorong to Abandon Darkness and Come Over to the Light
    On the morning of the 23rd of this month, Liu Ruolong and Song Baorong, two air force personnel of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan, piloted a trainer aircraft in a revolt and safely flew back to the mainland of the motherland. They received a warm welcome and cordial reception from the local people and the People's Liberation Army. The righteous and patriotic action of Liu Ruolong and Song Baorong once again pointed out a correct path of abandoning darkness and coming over to the light to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit officers and soldiers who are still enslaved under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Taiwan.
    Before Liu Ruolong and Song Baorong revolted, there had already been instances of former Chiang Kai-shek air force personnel Qin Baozun, Tao Kaifu, and Hu Hongyi flying aircraft in revolt and returning to the mainland of the motherland. They could not bear the oppression of the American aggressors and were unwilling to carry out the dirty war of betraying the country and harming the people for the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. They bravely broke through the control of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents and returned to the mainland of the motherland. According to the policy and reward methods of our Ministry of National Defense regarding the acceptance and appropriate employment of Chiang Kai-shek bandit army uprising personnel, they all received generous rewards after piloting aircraft in revolt. Later, the motherland accepted their own applications and allowed Qin Baozun and Tao Kaifu to participate in study and continue their studies; Hu Hongyi has been assigned to the Civil Aviation Administration and has gloriously embarked on a revolutionary job. Now they are all happily studying and working in the embrace of the great motherland, living a happy life. Liu Ruolong and Song Baorong, who have now revolted, will also receive the same free and happy life and glorious work. However, at present, there are still many Chiang Kai-shek army officers and soldiers living an extremely painful and unfree life under the reactionary rule and special agent control of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. The American aggressors and their running dog Chiang Kai-shek also frequently force them to make unnecessary sacrifices. Their only way to get rid of pain is to learn from the example of Liu and Song, resolutely revolt, and come over to the motherland and the people's side.
    We welcome Liu Ruolong and Song Baorong for piloting aircraft in revolt and flying back to the mainland of the motherland, and we are also willing to once again offer loyal advice to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army officers and soldiers who are still in Taiwan: The people of the motherland have already determined to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and liberate Taiwan and other coastal islands. This is something that no enemy can stop. The liberation of Yijiangshan Island, Dachen Island, and Nanjishan Island has already demonstrated this great determination of the people of the motherland. The road taken by Qin Baozun, Tao Kaifu, Hu Hongyi, Liu Ruolong, and Song Baorong is the only bright road that all officers and soldiers of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit army should take at present.
    Officers and soldiers under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits: Your parents, wives, brothers, and sisters are all hoping that you will use your useful knowledge and skills to serve the motherland and the people, so that the sacred territory of the motherland, Taiwan, can be liberated as soon as possible, and that millions of suffering compatriots in Taiwan can gain freedom and happiness as soon as possible. You must work hard, do not fail the kind expectations of the people of the motherland and your loved ones, do not lightly ruin your great future, and do not continue to act as unnecessary sacrifices for the evil purposes of the US-Chiang clique. The motherland and the people are calling you, your parents, wives, brothers, and sisters are hoping that you will resolutely return. You must make up your mind, look for all possible opportunities, break through the control of the US-Chiang secret agents, rush out of that evil abyss, and throw yourselves into the warm embrace of the motherland, and join the people of the motherland in moving towards a bright and happy future.

    欢迎刘若龙和宋宝荣弃暗投明
    本月二十三日上午，台湾蒋贼空军人员刘若龙和宋宝荣二人驾驶教练机一架起义，安全飞返祖国大陆，他们受到了当地人民和人民解放军的热烈欢迎和亲切接待。刘若龙和宋宝荣的正义的爱国行动，再一次向目前还留在台湾受着蒋贼统治奴役的蒋贼军官兵指出了一条弃暗投明的正确道路。
    在刘若龙和宋宝荣起义以前，就已经有过原蒋贼军空军人员秦保尊、陶开府和胡弘一等驾机起义、飞返祖国大陆的事例。他们不堪美国侵略者的压迫，不愿替卖国贼蒋介石进行卖国残民的肮脏战争，勇敢地突破蒋贼特务的控制，回到了祖国大陆。根据我国国防部关于对待蒋贼军起义人员量才录用的政策和奖励办法，他们在驾机起义以后都得到了优厚的奖赏。以后祖国又接受他们自己的申请，让秦保尊和陶开府参加学习，继续深造；胡弘一则已被分配到民用航空局，光荣地走上了革命的工作岗位。现在他们都在伟大祖国的怀抱里愉快地学习着和工作着，过着幸福的生活。现在起义的刘若龙和宋宝荣，也将得到同样自由幸福的生活和光荣的工作。但是，目前还有许多蒋贼军官兵在蒋贼的反动统治和特务控制之下过着极端痛苦的和不自由的生活，美国侵略者和它的走狗蒋介石还经常逼迫着他们去作无谓的牺牲。他们唯一的摆脱痛苦的办法，就是学习刘、宋二人的榜样，毅然决然地举行起义，投到祖国和人民方面来。
    我们欢迎刘若龙、宋宝荣二人驾机起义飞返祖国大陆，同时也愿意向目前仍然留在台湾的蒋贼军官兵再次提出忠告：祖国人民已经下定决心要消灭蒋介石卖国集团，解放台湾和其他沿海岛屿，这是任何敌人所阻挡不住的。一江山岛和大陈岛以及南麂山等岛屿的解放，已经说明了祖国人民的这种伟大决心。秦保尊，陶开府，胡弘一，刘若龙和宋宝荣等所走的道路，是蒋贼军的一切官兵目前所应该走的唯一光明大道。
    在蒋贼统治下的官兵们：你们的父母妻子兄弟姐妹们都在盼望你们用你们有用的知识和技能为祖国和人民服务，使祖国的神圣领土台湾早日得到解放，使台湾数百万受苦受难的同胞早日获得自由和幸福，你们必须努力，不要辜负祖国人民和你们的亲人们对你们的亲切期望，不要把自己的远大前途轻轻断送，不要继续为美蒋的罪恶目的充当无谓的牺牲品。祖国和人民在招唤着你们，你们的父母妻子兄弟姐妹们在盼望你们毅然归来。你们要下定决心，寻找一切可能的机会，突破美蒋特务的控制，冲出那个罪恶的渊薮，投向祖国的温暖怀抱，同祖国人民一道走向光明幸福的未来。
