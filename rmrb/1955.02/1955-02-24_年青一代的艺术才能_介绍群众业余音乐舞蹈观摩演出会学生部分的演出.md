The student performances of the Mass Amateur Music and Dance Festival, jointly organized by the Ministry of Culture, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Ministry of Higher Education, and the Ministry of Education, were held in Beijing from February 10th to 14th. This performance was held on the basis of the relatively widespread development of extracurricular art activities among students nationwide. Two hundred and thirty-four young students from seven major cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Dalian, Shenyang, and Chongqing, presented ninety-three programs, selected from over 17,000 participants and over 1,200 programs from various cities. This was the first national event for student extracurricular art activities. This performance demonstrated the rich artistic creativity of young people, and the excellent achievements in their artistic learning during their spare time. These valuable new forces allow us to see the future of the country's artistic endeavors.

The happy younger generation wholeheartedly pours their love for the motherland and their love for life into their artistic creations: the dance "Clapping Dance," collectively created by the junior group of the Beijing No. 8 Girls' Middle School Dance Troupe, allows us to see the happy life and sincere friendship of the Young Pioneers. When one child becomes isolated from the group due to selfishness, how lonely she is! This is an education; selfish people never have friends. The spirit of collectivism gradually rises in her heart, and she takes out her beloved toys to play with everyone. Everyone warmly welcomes her. The dance "Carnival on the Warship" from Guangzhou No. 1 Middle School shows us another scene: as the morning sun rises on the sea, the Young Pioneers, like a group of adorable little doves, flood onto the deck. They present red scarves representing the hearts of the Young Pioneers, and a model warship representing their infinite love and respect for the naval uncles. Serious and affectionate emotions are exchanged, and the carnival begins. Naval dances, tambourine dances, and various group dances are performed in turn, and the joy reaches a climax. However, the children suddenly think of the other side of the sea, where countless children are suffering and longing for liberation. They all raise their hands, and the determination to liberate Taiwan is transmitted from their faces to the hearts of the audience. The dance "Exercise Group Dance," collectively created by the Shanghai Electrical Manufacturing School, reflects the lives of students from another perspective. This is a comic dance, which kindly satirizes bookworms who only study and people who love to show off and are detached from the masses, and helps them correct their erroneous attitudes towards physical exercise. Yu Dacheng of Beijing No. 21 Middle School composed the piano solo "Dusk on Campus," which uses beautiful melodies to depict the scenery of the campus at dusk. It is a quiet dusk, with a gentle breeze blowing; the lively and dynamic rhythm expresses the joyful activities of the youth. The author, Yu Dacheng, has not studied theoretical composition. Although this work is still immature and the technical level is limited, the creative attitude starting from life and the love for art indicate that he is a young man with potential for development.

In terms of performing arts, the healthy and simple artistic style of the young people, the strong atmosphere of life, and the performance methods that delve into the artistic conception of the works are equally admirable. Li Liansheng, a first-year high school student at Beijing No. 25 Middle School, sings the "Tanker March," not only because his voice itself is round, full, and very pleasant to hear, but also because it expresses the heroic spirit of the tank soldiers. When he sings "If Stalin needs us to fight, the Marshal leads us to the battlefield," his emotions are high-pitched and unrestrained, singing out the pride of the tank soldiers. Liu Chunying, a first-year junior high school girl from Shenyang No. 6 Middle School, sang selections from the Ping Opera "Liu Qiao'er" and the opera "Xiao Erhei's Marriage," and Zhang Jialing, a second-year female student from the Chongqing Southwest Russian Language College, sang the Yunnan folk song "The River Rises, the Sand Surges." They can all delicately express the emotions of the songs and the strong national style. They have not specifically studied vocal music, but only learned from records and from the masses. Their ability to achieve such a singing level, and this spirit of hard work, is something that people engaged in artistic careers need to particularly promote.

In terms of choral performance, the Tianjin six-person female ensemble's "Song of Spring" and other three songs, the beautiful singing completely become a whole. The Shenyang ten-person female chorus "Flying Kites" and the Guangzhou eight-person female chorus "Three Maidens" all express simple and healthy emotions with lively and vivid stage images. In particular, the re-creation in the performance of "Three Maidens" is successful. Precisely because the songs reflect their own feelings, they naturally created vivid stage images: three maidens are chatting in the classroom, and their classmates are attentively listening to them narrate their ideals. The performance is as natural as chatting in the classroom, making the audience feel relaxed and happy as well.

In terms of dance performance art, Gao Chunying, a junior high school student from Shanghai Lianqun Middle School, is only fifteen years old this year, but has received eight years of ballet training. This time she performed a segment of "Swan Lake," and it can be seen that she has reached a fairly high level in mastering ballet techniques. The Uzbek dance collectively performed by six people in Chongqing, the movements are clear and clean, the emotions are lively and happy, and the level of dance technique is also quite high. This all proves that these amateur actors have a hard-working attitude in their extracurricular studies, and therefore have a certain degree of cultivation in basic dance training.

There were also many excellent instrumental performances in the performance. Dian Junyao, a third-year student at the Beijing Petroleum Geology Exploration School, performed the flute solo "Flying Kites," Ying Shihui, a student in the civil engineering department of Tsinghua University in Beijing, performed the piano solo "Impromptu Fantasy," Xu Qipeng, a fourth-year student at Shanghai Jiaotong University, performed the violin solo "Zigeunerweisen," and Zeng Fulu, a fourth-year student at the same school, performed the pipa solo "White Snow in the Spring Sun." These programs have all reached a certain level. These programs show that these young people, in the little time they have after school, have developed the spirit of hard work that is indispensable for engaging in artistic endeavors, and have achieved considerable achievements.

In addition to many programs that received awards, two accompanists also received excellent awards from the conference, namely Ying Shizhen, a senior high school student from Tianjin No. 7 Girls' Middle School, and Lin Ling, a junior high school student from Shanghai No. 3 Girls' Middle School. Their performance attitude is serious, their spirit of cooperation is very good, and their level of performance is also very high. Every program is very complete, truly achieving the goal of promoting the performers' advantages and making up for the performers' shortcomings.

This performance was a success. Many excellent programs emerged in the performance, and many excellent singing talents also emerged. Young students not only have artistic talent, but also have the basic conditions for further cultivation in terms of voice, body shape, limbs, and so on. The literary and art circles gave a very high evaluation to such a wonderful performance. Everyone believes that individual excellent performances even exceed the level of some professional art groups. In particular, the simplicity and naturalness of the artistic style, and the emphasis on expressing content and emotions, are even more worthy of professional art workers to learn from. Professional art workers should not only enthusiastically care for them and carefully nurture the new generation, but also humbly learn from them.

On the basis of this performance, student extracurricular art activities will surely develop more vigorously. The next performance will have more excellent programs and more excellent singing talents. These new seedlings will surely grow sturdily, and we will see bright flowers blooming everywhere.

    年青一代的艺术才能
    ——介绍群众业余音乐舞蹈观摩演出会学生部分的演出
    徐明
    文化部、全国总工会、青年团中央、高等教育部和教育部五个单位联合举办的群众业余音乐舞蹈观摩演出会学生部分的演出，二月十日到十四日在北京举行。这次演出是在全国学生课余艺术活动已经比较普遍开展的基础上举行的。来自北京、天津、上海、广州、旅大、沈阳、重庆七大城市的青年学生有二百三十四人、九十三个节目，这是从各市参加会演的一万七千多人、一千二百多个节目里选出来的。这是学生课余艺术活动第一次全国性的活动。这次演出，显示了青少年们的艺术创造力是丰富的，在课余时间里从事艺术的学习成绩是优良的，这些可贵的新生的力量，使我们看见了祖国艺术事业的远景。
    幸福的年青一代把自己对祖国的热爱、对生活的热爱，纯朴地灌注在他们的艺术创造中：北京市第八女子中学舞蹈团少年组集体创作的舞蹈“拍手舞”，让我们看见了少先队员的愉快生活和真诚的友谊。当有一个孩子由于自私而脱离了集体的时候，她是多么孤独！这是一个教育，自私的人永远是没有朋友的。集体主义的精神在她心中逐渐升起，她拿出自己心爱的玩具和大家一齐玩，大家热情地欢迎她。广州市第一中学的舞蹈“军舰上的联欢”向我们显现了另一个画面：当朝阳在海面升起时，少先队员们像一群可爱的小鸽子一样涌上了甲板，她们献上了代表着少先队员的心的红领巾，献上代表他们对海军叔叔无限敬爱的心情的军舰模型。严肃而亲切的感情在交流，联欢会开始了，海军舞、铃鼓舞、各种集体舞轮流地表演着，欢乐到达了高潮，但是，孩子们突然想到了海的那边，还有无数的孩子们正在苦难中盼望着解放，他们一齐举起手来，解放台湾的决心从他们脸上传到观众的心里。上海电器制造学校集体创作的舞蹈“锻炼小组舞”又从另一个角度反映了学生的生活。这是一个滑稽舞，它善意地讽刺了死读书的书呆子和爱出风头脱离群众的人，并且帮助他俩改正了对体育锻炼的错误态度。北京市第二十一中学于大成创作的钢琴独奏曲“校园的黄昏”，用优美的旋律描绘了校园黄昏时的景色，这是幽静的黄昏，微风轻轻地吹着；活泼跳动的节奏，表现青年们在愉快地活动着。作者于大成并没有学习过理论作曲，尽管这个作品还是不成熟的，技术水平也是有限的，但是从生活出发的创作态度，热爱艺术的心情说明了他是有培养前途的青年。
    在表演艺术上，青少年们的健康朴素的艺术作风，浓厚的生活气息，深入作品意境的表演方法，同样令人赞赏。北京市第二十五中学高中一年级学生李濂生演唱的“坦克手进行曲”，不仅因为声音本身圆润宽厚非常悦耳，也表达了坦克手的英雄气概，当他唱“如果斯大林需要我们去战斗，大元帅率领我们上战场”时感情高亢而奔放，唱出了坦克手的自豪。沈阳市第六中学初中一年级的女学生刘春英演唱了评剧“刘巧儿”选曲及歌剧“小二黑结婚”的选曲，还有重庆市西南俄文专科学校二年级女学生张嘉玲演唱了云南民歌“大河涨水沙浪沙”等，都能细腻地表达了歌曲的感情和浓厚的民族风格。她们并没有专门地学习声乐，只是跟唱片学、跟群众学，能达到这样的演唱水平，这种努力学习的精神是从事艺术事业的人需要特别发扬的。
    在合唱表演方面，天津市六人女声小合唱“春之歌”等三首歌曲，优美的歌声浑然成为一个整体。沈阳市十人的女声齐唱“放风筝”、广州市八人的女声合唱“三位少女”都以活泼生动的舞台形象表达出了朴素健康的感情，尤其是“三位少女”在表演上的再创造是成功的，正因为歌曲反映了她们自己的感情，所以她们很自然地创造了生动的舞台形象：三位少女在课堂中谈天，她们的同学在关切地倾听她们叙述自己的理想，演出就像在课堂中谈天那样自如，使观众也同样地感到了轻松愉快。
    在舞蹈的表演艺术方面，上海市联群中学初三学生高醇英，今年才十五岁，但已受了八年芭蕾舞的训练，这一次她表演了“天鹅湖”中的一段舞，可以看出她在掌握芭蕾舞的技术上，已达到相当高的水平。重庆市六人集体表演的乌兹别克舞，动作明确而干净，情绪活泼愉快，舞蹈技术水平也是相当高的。这都证明这些业余的演员在课余学习中态度是刻苦的，因而在舞蹈基本训练方面已有了一定的修养。
    演出中也出现不少优秀的器乐表演。北京市石油地质勘探学校三年级学生典俊耀表演了笛子独奏
  “放风筝”、北京市清华大学土木系学生应诗慧表演了钢琴独奏“即兴幻想曲”、上海市交通大学四年级学生徐起鹏表演小提琴独奏“流浪者之歌”及该校四年级学生曾富律表演的琵琶独奏“阳春白雪”等节目都达到了一定的水平。这几个节目说明这些年青人在课余的很少的时间里，发扬了从事艺术事业所不可缺少的刻苦锻炼的精神，并且获得了相当高的成就。
    除了许多节目得到了奖励以外，还有两位伴奏者也得到了大会授予的优秀奖，这是天津市女七中高三学生应诗真和上海市女三中高二学生林玲。她们演出的态度是严肃的，合作精神是非常好的，演奏水平同样也是很高的，每一个节目都很完整，真正做到发扬了表演者的优点并弥补了表演者的不足。
    这一次的演出是成功的，演出中涌现了许多优秀节目，也涌现了许多优秀的演唱人材，青年学生们不仅是有艺术天才，而且在声音、身材、四肢等等方面具备了能够培养深造的基本条件。对这样精彩的演出，文艺界给予了很高的评价。大家认为个别的优秀的表演，甚至超过某些专业艺术团体的水平。尤其是在艺术作风上的朴素自然，注重表现内容和感情更值得专业的艺术工作者学习。专业的艺术工作者不仅应该热情地关心他们，细致谨慎地培育着新生的一代，而且应该虚心地向他们学习。
    在这次演出的基础上，学生课余艺术活动定会更加蓬勃地开展，下一次的会演将会有更多的优秀节目、更多的优秀演唱人材出现；这些新生的嫩苗定会茁壮地成长，我们将会看到鲜艳的花朵遍地开放。（附图片）
