    Periodicals Should Be Published on Time
    To the Editors:
    In the advertisement columns of some newspapers, one can often see notices of various periodicals being delayed or partially delayed due to some reason. In December of last year, the People's Daily published advertisements for nearly ten kinds of periodicals delayed due to some reason. For example, the 24th issue of "Popular Cinema" was delayed by two days, "Architectural Translations" was delayed by eight days, "Architecture" monthly was delayed by thirteen days, and "People's Music," which should have been published on December 18, 1954, did not meet readers until January 20 of this year, a delay of more than thirty days. Other publications such as "Drama Gazette" and "Hydroelectric Power" also experienced delays due to various reasons. This January, the number of periodicals announcing delays in the People's Daily advertisement column increased to twelve. The situation of many periodicals not being published on time does not seem to have started recently. According to a recent statistic from the Beijing Post Office, from January to October 1954, an average of two-thirds of the periodicals could not be published on time each month, and the number of periodicals that could not be published on time in October of last year reached 80 percent. The failure of many periodicals to be published on time has caused dissatisfaction among the vast number of readers. Every kind of periodical has a large readership, and readers regard their favorite periodicals as regular spiritual food. Take "China Youth," for example. As far as I know, many local Communist Youth League organizations regard it as a guide for their study, work, and life, and list reading "China Youth" as one of the regular activities of the League organizations. However, "China Youth" often has issues that are delayed, which affects the study plans of some readers. We often hear some comrades say: "If periodicals are not published on time, they lose their function as periodicals. Why should we subscribe to them!" The delay of periodicals also affects the work plans of the post office distribution and transportation departments, because the post office and transportation departments arrange their work according to the publication dates of each periodical. If periodicals cannot be published on time, it will disrupt their plans and increase their work troubles. It is hoped that the editorial departments of various periodicals will strengthen their work planning and sense of time, in order to ensure the timely publication of periodicals.

### 定期刊物要按期出版

    定期刊物要按期出版编辑同志：
    在一些报纸的广告栏内，经常会看到各种期刊因故延期或部分延期的启事。去年十二月份人民日报曾刊登了将近十种期刊因故延期的广告。如二十四期“大众电影”延期了两天，“建筑译丛”延期八天，“建筑”月刊延期十三天，应在一九五四年十二月十八日出版的“人民音乐”，一直延迟到今年一月二十日才同读者见面，延期出版三十多天。其它如“戏剧报”、“水力发电”等刊物，也都发生了因故延期的情况。今年一月份在人民日报刊登广告宣布延期的期刊又增加到十二种。很多期刊不能如期出版的情况，看来还不是在最近才发生的。据北京邮局不久以前的统计，从一九五四年一月到十月，平均每月有三分之二的期刊都不能按期出版，去年十月份不能按期出版的期刊竟达百分之八十。很多定期刊物不能按期出版，引起了广大读者的不满，无论那一种定期刊物，都拥有广大的读者，读者们都把自己所喜爱的期刊当作经常的精神食粮。以“中国青年”来说吧，据我了解，很多地方的青年团组织，都把它当做自己学习、工作和生活的导师，并把阅读“中国青年”列为团组织的经常活动内容之一；可是“中国青年”常常有部分要延期出版，因而也就影响到一部分读者的学习计划。我们常听到一些同志说：“期刊不按期出版，就失去期刊的作用了，我们还订它干啥！”期刊的脱期，也影响了邮局发行和运输部门的工作计划，因为邮局和运输部门都是按照各个期刊出版日期来安排自己的工作的，如果期刊不能如期出版，就会打乱了他们的计划，增加了他们工作上的麻烦。希望各个期刊编辑部加强工作上的计划性和时间观念，以保证定期刊物按期出版。
