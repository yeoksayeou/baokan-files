How Shijiazhuang Organizes Intra-City Transportation
Sun Zhiwei, Li Shisheng

In 1954, the construction area of basic construction in Shijiazhuang was approximately 2.2 times that of 1953. Industrial and agricultural production and material exchange also greatly developed, thus the city's transportation tasks were very heavy. At the beginning of the year, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Finance and Economics Commission summarized the basic experiences and lessons of the 1953 transportation work. At that time, there were more vehicles than goods in the off-season, resulting in a large waste of transportation capacity. From January to June, only 40% of the annual transportation task was completed, and the vehicle attendance rate was generally below 58%. However, the transportation tasks were highly concentrated in the peak season, and the transportation capacity was far from enough. This imbalance in transportation once caused some basic construction and production units to stop work awaiting transportation and caused some commodities to be out of stock. The Shijiazhuang Municipal Finance and Economics Commission learned from this lesson, strengthened its leadership in transportation work in 1954, and adopted different measures according to different situations in different periods, with the central link being to organize balanced transportation and fully utilize transportation efficiency.

First, in the off-season, focus on organizing planned advance storage and transportation. From the perspective of the need for balanced transportation throughout the year and from the perspective of the natural conditions of warm weather and smooth roads in the first quarter, this is appropriate. However, there are many difficulties in organizing as many transportation tasks as possible in the first quarter. The construction materials for basic construction, which account for the largest proportion of transportation tasks, are minimal in the first quarter. In March, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Finance and Economics Commission carried out a planned ranking of transportation tasks, focusing on construction materials for basic construction, especially focusing on the State-owned No. 2 Cotton Factory project, which accounted for more than a quarter of the city's basic construction tasks, and transferring materials that could be prepared in advance. This increased the average vehicle attendance rate in March by more than one-tenth and the average transport volume by more than one-third compared to January and February.

Second, arrange storage and transportation before the rainy season and prepare for transportation in the rainy season as early as possible. This work was not done well in 1953, causing the flour mill to almost stop production due to the inability to transport raw materials and products during the rainy season, and some trade outlets ran out of goods such as department stores, sugar, and alkali. In June 1954, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Finance and Economics Commission quickly analyzed and ranked materials, roads, and rain protection equipment, and determined that materials such as cement, sugar, alkali, and salt, which cannot be transported in the rain, should be transported in appropriate quantities before the rainy season; materials such as grain, flour, and cloth, which require rain protection equipment to be transported, should strive to complete appropriate transportation before the rainy season; at the same time, it urged relevant units to repair roads, repair and add rain protection equipment, creating favorable conditions for the normal supply of materials and transportation in the rainy season.

Third, use a variety of emergency measures to complete heavy and urgent transportation tasks. After entering the third quarter, there was heavy rainfall, long rainy season, and muddy roads. The attendance rate and transportation efficiency were extremely low before and after the rain, but the transportation tasks such as rain protection, flood control, and basic construction greatly increased. The transportation volume in the third quarter was equivalent to more than half of the past year, and the transportation volume in September alone was equivalent to the past quarter. At this time, the city's original transportation capacity could only complete half of the task, and the original loading and unloading capacity could only complete 58% of the loading and unloading tasks. Many important materials could not be transported due to lack of vehicles. In order to overcome the above contradictions, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Finance and Economics Commission took the following measures:

    One, strengthen planning and scheduling work to fully utilize transportation efficiency. The transportation department promptly and reasonably allocated vehicles and loading and unloading workers based on the transportation tasks, road conditions, and cargo yard turnover capacity, so that transportation capacity matched the tasks. It also contacted the shipping department to prepare vehicles, loading and unloading workers, and materials before dispatching vehicles, and determined specific and appropriate times and addresses, reducing vehicle and labor idling. The shipping department also correspondingly improved its work, so that after the vehicles arrived, they could quickly find the loading and unloading addresses, and load and unload in a timely, rapid, and smooth manner, shortening the loading and unloading time.

    Some new measures were also taken in the scheduling, management, and use of vehicles. According to the principle of combining unified scheduling throughout the city and temporary and appropriate fixed transportation capacity in departments, part of the transportation capacity was handed over to the vehicle-using departments with large tasks and long vehicle usage times, reducing the time and procedures for vehicles to travel back and forth for scheduling and improving transportation efficiency. In order to highly mobilize and accurately allocate transportation capacity and solve some temporary urgent needs, transportation capacity was also allocated daily according to the degree of importance and urgency. In order to adapt to the needs of rainy season transportation, sunny days adopted the method of allocating transportation capacity according to departments to ensure the normal supply of basic construction, production, and trade departments, complete appropriate inventory storage and transportation, and use a considerable amount of mobile transportation capacity to complete the material storage and transportation of various departments along the line blocked by rain and the storage and transportation of rain-sensitive materials. Rainy days adopted the method of unified scheduling of transportation capacity throughout the city, focusing on the transportation of materials that can be transported in the rain and roads that can be used. In areas where transportation capacity was concentrated but roads could not be turned around and during periods when transportation tasks were concentrated but transportation capacity was insufficient, some freight trucks and horse-drawn carts were organized to operate at night and in two shifts.

    Two, correspondingly organize, expand, and consolidate transportation capacity. More than 96% of the搬运 (ban yun) vehicles in Shijiazhuang were organized by scattered and individual mass vehicles. The vehicle workers lived scattered in villages in the suburbs, and the attendance rate was very low on cloudy and rainy days. The transportation department of Shijiazhuang City often relied on Party and government organizations at all levels in the suburbs to mobilize and educate vehicle workers to actively attend work, so that the attendance rate in the rainy season was greatly improved, and the attendance rate could also be maintained at more than 85% during the busy farming season such as autumn harvest and wheat planting. In order to eliminate the opportunity for stray vehicles to raise prices, disrupt national plans, and affect the consolidation of organized vehicles, and to give full play to their active role in serving the national transportation tasks, Shijiazhuang City temporarily implemented unified management and scheduling of more than 500排子 (pai zi) carts and more than 100 horse-drawn carts that were originally scattered, and also temporarily implemented unified scheduling and use of all truck drivers and freight trucks in the city. This concentrated all transportation capacity in the city and put it into transportation.

    Three, regularly check road conditions and loading and unloading address operations, and repair them in a timely manner. After the rain, up to three-fifths of the roads were often missed or forced vehicles to transport long distances due to low-lying, narrow, muddy, and blocked roads in the most serious cases, and transportation was even interrupted in some areas. The Shijiazhuang Municipal Finance and Economics Commission promptly organized the transportation department, the shipping department, and the municipal construction department to complete many road and cargo yard repairs after the rain, and quickly restored traffic.

    Four, strengthen cooperation and coordination between transportation departments and between transportation and shipping departments.

After taking the above series of measures, the contradictions such as more goods than vehicles, more loading and unloading tasks but less loading and unloading capacity, and larger transportation tasks but small line and cargo yard throughput capacity and turnover volume were overcome, and the national transportation tasks were basically completed; but because the growth of transportation capacity and transportation equipment was not adapted to the speed of the sharp increase in transportation tasks, there were still shortcomings in the transportation organization. The construction of some construction projects and the production of enterprises were affected, and some important national allocation plans were not completed in time. In 1955, the transportation volume in Shijiazhuang City increased even more, and it is even more necessary to further overcome shortcomings and arrange future transportation work with foresight.

    石家庄是怎样组织市内运输工作的
    孙志伟　李适生
    一九五四年石家庄市基本建设的工程面积，约相当于一九五三年的两点二倍多，工农业生产和物资交流也有很大的发展，因而市内的运输任务很繁重。年初的时候，石家庄市财政经济委员会总结了一九五三年运输工作的基本经验教训，那时淡季车多货少，运力浪费很大，一至六月仅完成全年运输任务的百分之四十，车辆出勤率一般在百分之五十八以下；而旺季运输任务高度集中，运力又大为不足。这种运输的不均衡状态，曾一度使某些基本建设和生产单位停工待运和造成某些商品脱销。石家庄市财政经济委员会吸取了这个教训，在一九五四年加强了对运输工作的领导，以组织均衡运输和充分发挥运输效能为中心环节，区别不同时期的不同情况，采取了不同的措施。
    第一，在淡季着重组织有计划的提前储运。从全年均衡运输的需要来说，从第一季天暖路畅的自然条件来说，这样做都是合适的。但要在第一季度组织尽可能多的运输任务，却有许多困难，占运输任务比重最大的基本建设备料，在第一季度数量甚微。三月份，石家庄市财政经济委员会有计划地进行了运输任务的排队，重点抓住基本建设的备料，特别是突出的抓紧占全市基本建设任务四分之一以上的国棉二厂工程，把能够预先准备的材料提前调运。使三月份比一、二月份平均车辆出勤率提高了十分之一以上，平均运量提高了三分之一以上。
    第二，及早安排雨季前的储运和雨季运输的准备工作。一九五三年此项工作做得不好，使面粉厂在雨季中原料运不进、产品运不出而几乎停工，有些贸易门市部的百货、糖、碱等脱销。一九五四年六月份石家庄市财政经济委员会迅速进行了物资、道路、防雨设备的分析排队，确定水泥、糖、碱、盐等雨中不能运输的物资，首先在雨季前完成适量运输；粮食、面粉、布匹等需有防雨设备才能运输的物资，力争提前在雨季前完成适量运输；同时并督促有关单位整修道路、修缮和增置防雨设备，为雨季中物资的正常供应和雨季运输创造了有利条件。
    第三，用多种多样的紧急措施，完成繁重紧迫的运输任务。进入第三季后，雨水大、雨期长，道路泥泞，雨前、雨后出勤率和运输效率极低而防雨防汛及基本建设等运输任务却大大增加，第三季运量相当过去半年以上的运量，九月份一个月的运量，相当过去一季的运量。这时，市内原有运输力仅能完成任务的一半，原有装卸力仅能完成装卸任务的百分之五十八，许多重要物资因为没有车辆而运不出去。为了克服上述矛盾，石家庄市财政经济委员会采取了以下措施：
    一、加强计划调度工作，充分发挥运输效能。运输部门及时根据运输任务，道路通阻、货场周转容量的情况，合理准确的调配车辆和装卸工人，使运力与任务相称，并与托运部门联系，做好调车前的车辆、装卸工人配备和物资准备，确定具体适当的时间、地址，减少了窝车和窝工现象。托运部门也相应地改进工作，使车辆到达后，尽快的找到装卸地址，及时、迅速、顺利地装卸，缩短了装卸时间。
    在车辆的调度管理和运用上，也采取了一些新的措施，根据全市统一调度和部门临时适量固定运力相结合的原则，把一部分运力交给任务大、使用车辆时间长的用车部门负责，减少了车辆往返调度运转的时间和手续，提高了运输效率。为高度机动和准确的调配运力，解决某些临时急需，还逐日区别轻重缓急分配运力。为了适应雨季运输的需要晴天采取按部门调配运力的办法，保证基本建设、生产和贸易各部门的正常供应，完成适量的库存储运，并以相当数量的机动运力突击完成因雨阻塞道路的沿线各部门的物资储运及怕雨物资的储运。雨天采取全市运力统一调度的办法，突击雨中能运物资及能走的道路的运输。在运力集中而道路周转不开的地区和运输任务集中而运力不足的期间，组织了部分货运汽车、马车实行夜间作业和两班作业。
    二、相应地组织、扩大并巩固运力。石家庄市搬运车辆百分之九十六以上是由分散的、个体的群众车辆组织起来的。车工散居在市郊各村，阴雨天出勤率很低。石家庄市的运输部门经常依靠郊区各级党政组织，动员和教育车工积极出勤，使雨季出勤率有很大的提高，在秋收、种麦等农忙期间，出勤率也能保持在百分之八十五以上。为解除流散车辆乘机抬价、破坏国家计划、影响已组织起来的车辆的巩固，并发挥其为国家运输任务服务的积极作用，石家庄市将原流散的排子车五百余辆、马车百余辆临时实行统一管理调度，并将全市汽车司机、货运汽车临时实行统一调度运用。使全市所有运力集中起来投入运输。
    三、经常检查道路通阻和装卸地址作业情况，并及时进行整修。雨后的道路，最严重时有五分之三以上因低洼、狭窄、泥泞、阻塞而经常误车或迫使车辆绕远运输，部分地区甚至运输中断，石家庄市财政经济委员会及时组织运输部门、托运部门和市政建设部门在雨后突击完成许多道路、货场的整修，迅速恢复了交通。
    四、加强运输部门间、运输与托运部门间的协作配合。
    采取上述一系列的措施后，克服了货多车少、装卸任务多而装卸力少、运输任务大而线路、货场通过能力与周转量小等矛盾，基本上完成了国家的运输任务；但因运力和运输设备的增长与运输任务骤增的速度不相适应，运输组织还有缺点，有些建筑工程的施工和企业的生产都曾受到影响，有些国家的重要调拨计划也没有及时完成。一九五五年，石家庄市的运输量更增大了，更需要进一步克服缺点，有预见地安排今后的运输工作。
