The Shanghai Municipal People's Supervision Committee conducted an understanding and inspection of the handling of people's letters and visits by Shanghai municipal and district-level agencies in the third quarter of 1954. The inspection results show that many units have improved their handling of people's letters compared to the past and have achieved certain results. For example, leading cadres of the Industry and Commerce Bureau and the Taxation Bureau have insisted on implementing the system of taking turns to meet with the masses every Saturday afternoon, which has been well received by the masses. Through handling people's letters, ten units under the Commercial Bureau, such as China Department Store Company, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, and Pharmaceutical Company, discovered some illegal activities of illegal capitalists in processing and ordering goods, and recovered more than 2.8 billion yuan of national property. From January to July 1954, the Taxation Bureau recovered more than 5.42 billion yuan of tax revenue into the treasury based on reports from the people. The Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of China Department Store Company accepted the suggestions from the people, improved the weaving method of the soles of socks with reinforced bottoms, and calculated based on the total sock production in the city, could save 224 pieces of cotton yarn annually, equivalent to 2.5 billion to 3 billion yuan in RMB.

However, the situation of handling people's letters and visits in various units in Shanghai is very uneven. Many units still have relatively serious problems in handling people's letters:

First, the institutions for handling people's letters and visits are not sound, and the staffing situation cannot meet the current work requirements. According to this survey, most units only have two or three people, and some units (such as the Bureau of Culture) do not even have a full-time cadre; and the policy and ideological level of the cadres is generally low. Therefore, these units can only do some copying and forwarding of people's letters, and cannot supervise and inspect the handling of people's letters by their subordinate business departments, let alone conduct comprehensive research. This reduces the due role of people's letters. It is particularly noteworthy that some individual cadres are of poor character and even abuse their power to violate laws and regulations. For example, Chen Xiangxuan, a staff member of the People's Letter Section of the Labor Bureau, took advantage of his position to seduce and rape women while receiving visitors; Min Shichao, a clerk of the People's Letter Section of the General Office of the Municipal People's Government, used his position to help his brother-in-law Yao Maolin (a capitalist) refuse the Municipal Real Estate Administration to take back the house (both of the above two have been dealt with according to law). This has caused an extremely bad influence among the people.

Second, the phenomenon of backlog and even loss of letters is still quite common. For example, the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of China Department Store Company received a letter in November 1953 reporting on the shoddy workmanship of travel bags. The comrade in charge left it in the drawer for more than half a year, and only handed it over to another comrade when he went out on official business, but it was still not handled quickly. The Dongchang District Public Security Sub-bureau, whose confidential staff member concurrently managed the work of people's letters, stuffed the received letters in the drawer without processing them. By August of last year, 102 people's letters had been accumulated. As of August last year, the Xincheng District Industry and Commerce Section had accumulated a total of 691 people's letters. The Municipal Public Security Bureau once received a letter reporting that a cadre of the Public Security Bureau had not been working for more than a year but was still receiving salary. Although the Shanghai Municipal Supervision Committee urged many times, it was not processed and the original letter was lost. According to preliminary statistics from nine units of the municipal and district government agencies, a total of 96 people's letters have been lost or are missing.

Finally, although some letters have been processed in form, they are actually just perfunctory or even deviate. After the Bureau of Culture launched the transformation of private cultural enterprises, it received many letters from the masses reflecting the situation of amusement parks, storytelling theaters, and troupes. They only kept the letters as a reference for their work, and did not deal with them individually or reply to the letter writers. The Putuo District Public Security Sub-bureau received a letter from the people exposing a profiteer for undermining the planned supply work. The person in charge believed that the profiteer had been arrested for another case, so he did not transfer the letter to the relevant unit for joint processing, but filed it casually. The Changshu District Health Section received a letter from residents of the neighborhood requesting the establishment of public toilets and the filling of ditches. The comrade in charge neither investigated nor informed the letter writer, but falsely reported that "the case has been processed and the letter writer has been replied to." The Construction Engineering Bureau received a letter from a temporary worker on a construction site in the Northern District asking what the difference was between a temporary worker and a basic worker; the person in charge casually replied: "It's just that the work cards are different in red and green!" A cadre of the Cosmetics Section of the Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station of China Department Store Company even handed the report letter to the capitalist who was reported for handling.

In order to improve the work of handling people's letters, to further play the role of people's letters, and to strengthen the close ties between the people and the government, the Shanghai Municipal People's Supervision Committee has suggested that all units conduct a more comprehensive inspection of the work of handling people's letters and visits to overcome shortcomings and improve work. We believe that the phenomenon of not paying attention to people's letters is far from being isolated. The supervision departments in other regions should also learn from the practice of the Shanghai Municipal People's Supervision Committee and regularly inspect the work of handling people's letters in local units.

### 上海市不少机关对人民来信工作做得不好

    上海市不少机关对人民来信工作做得不好
    上海市人民政府人民监察委员会在一九五四年第三季度对上海市市、区两级机关处理人民来信来访的工作进行了了解和检查。从检查的结果来看，许多单位处理人民来信工作比过去已有所改进，也获得了一定的成绩。如工商局和税务局领导干部都坚持执行了每星期六下午轮流接见人民群众的制度，群众反映良好。商业局所属中国百货公司、花纱布公司、医药公司等十个单位通过处理人民来信，发现不法资本家在加工订货中的一些违法行为，并已追回国家财产二十八亿多元。税务局从一九五四年一月到七月由人民群众的检举而查明追回纳库的税款达五十四亿二千多万元。中国百货公司上海采购供应站接受了人民来信的建议，改进了夹底袜袜底的织法，以全市袜子总产量计算，全年可以节省棉纱二百二十四件，合人民币二十五亿到三十亿元。
    但是，上海市各单位处理人民来信来访工作的情况是很不平衡的。不少单位在处理人民来信工作中还存在着比较严重的问题：
    首先，处理人民来信来访的机构不健全，干部配备情况不能适应目前工作的要求。根据这次调查，大部分单位只有两三人，甚至有的单位（如文化局）连一个专职干部也没有；而且干部的政策思想水平一般也较低。因此，这些单位对人民来信只能做些抄转工作，不能对所属业务部门处理人民来信的工作进行督促检查，更谈不上综合研究了。这样就降低了人民来信应有的作用。尤其值得注意的是，还有个别干部品质恶劣，竟利用职权，违法乱纪。如劳动局人民来信科工作人员陈香煊竟在接待群众来访时利用职权，诱奸妇女；市人民政府办公厅人民来信科科员闵士超利用职权帮同姊夫姚茂林
  （资本家）拒绝市房地产管理局收回房屋（以上两人都已依法处理）。这更在人民群众中造成了极端恶劣的影响。
    其次，积压甚至丢失来信的现象还相当普遍。如中国百货公司上海采购供应站一九五三年十一月收到有关旅行袋偷工减料的检举信，承办同志在抽屉里一放半年多，后来因公外出才把信交给另一同志，但仍未迅速处理。东昌区公安分局由机要员兼管人民来信工作，收到来信就塞在抽屉里不作处理，到去年八月份已积压了一百零二封人民来信。新成区工商科到去年八月为止，共积压人民来信六百九十一件。市公安局曾收到一件检举公安局某干部一年多不做工作而薪津照发的来信，虽经上海市监委多次催办，但一直不作处理，而且还把原信遗失了。根据市、区政府机关九个单位的初步统计，已经遗失的或下落不明的人民来信共计九十六件。
    最后，有些来信在形式上虽然已经作了处理，但实际上只是敷衍了事，甚至还出了偏差。文化局展开私营文化企业改造工作后，收到很多群众反映游乐场、书场、剧团各方面情况的来信，他们只把来信留作工作上的参考，就不作个别处理，也不答复来信人。普陀区公安分局收到一件揭发奸商破坏计划供应工作的人民来信，承办人认为这个奸商已因另案被捕，就不将来信转到有关单位并案处理，而随手归档了。常熟区卫生科收到里弄居民要求设立公共厕所和填平水沟的来信，承办同志既不调查了解，也不向来信人交代，却虚报说：“该件已处理结束，并已答复来信人。”建筑工程局收到北区工地一个临时工的来信，询问临时工和基本工有什么分别；承办同志竟随便答复说：“是工卡红绿不同而已！”中国百货公司上海采购供应站化装品科一个干部还曾将检举信交被检举的资本家去处理。
    为了改进处理人民来信的工作，以进一步发挥人民来信的作用，加强人民群众和政府的密切联系，上海市人民监察委员会已建议各单位对处理人民来信来访的工作进行一次比较全面的检查，以克服缺点，改进工作。我们认为，目前对人民来信不重视的现象还远非个别的，其它地区的监察部门也应该学习上海市人民监察委员会的做法，定期检查当地各单位处理人民来信的工作。
