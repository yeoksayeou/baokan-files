(Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 7th) It is reported by the Vietnam News Agency, Hanoi, on February 6th that Prince Souphanouvong, representing the Lao Fighting Units, wrote a letter in January 1955 to Katay D. Sasorith, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, expressing agreement with Katay's view that both sides should cease all hostile actions, especially military actions, in order to establish conditions favorable for political negotiations and avoid misunderstandings among the Lao people and the people of the world.

The letter pointed out that, in reality, since the signing of the ceasefire agreement, the Royal Lao forces in the provinces of Luang Prabang and Xieng Khouang have taken advantage of the ceasefire to infiltrate the Lao Fighting Units' regrouping areas of Phongsaly Province and Sam Neua Province. At the same time, some French officers and soldiers were also airdropped into these two provinces, and they used some local areas as bases to collect scattered armed bandits hiding in the jungle, equip them, and disguise them as "Royal Forces." According to incomplete statistics, since the ceasefire, these armed forces have launched thirty-one attacks on the Lao Fighting Units, carried out several robberies and assassinations, and seriously violated the lives and property of the residents of the aforementioned two provinces.

The letter pointed out that, in addition, in areas under the rule of the Royal Lao Government such as Basak, Muong Nong, and Pak Xeng, there have been many acts of retaliation against those who participated in the patriotic war. These acts of sabotaging the ceasefire agreement have aggravated the tense situation in Laos, made the situation more complicated, and thus affected the negotiations between the two sides.

In the face of such a situation, in order to ensure the success of the current political conference and to satisfy the common aspirations of the Lao people, Prince Souphanouvong suggested that the Royal Lao Government order an immediate halt to hostile military actions against the Lao Fighting Units, and take appropriate measures to stop the illegal activities carried out by the Royal Government's subordinates in various regions. On the part of the Lao Fighting Units, Prince Souphanouvong reiterated its unwavering stance, which is to always find ways to avoid all conflicts and strictly implement the Lao ceasefire agreement.

Prince Souphanouvong also suggested in the letter that the Royal Lao Government and the Lao Fighting Units each order their delegations participating in the political conference to discuss the issue of issuing a joint statement on the cessation of military hostilities.

    苏发努冯代表寮国战斗部队致函老挝王国首相
    建议老挝王国政府下令停止敌对军事行动
    【新华社七日讯】越南通讯社河内六日讯：据悉，苏发努冯亲王代表寮国战斗部队在一九五五年一月写信给老挝王国政府首相克特，表示同意克特的看法，即：双方应该停止一切敌对行动尤其是军事行动，以便建立有利于政治谈判的条件，避免老挝人民和世界人民发生误解。
    信件指出：实际上，自从停战协定签订以后，琅勃剌邦省和川圹省的老挝王国部队，曾经利用停战而渗入寮国战斗部队集结区丰沙里省和桑怒省。同时，一些法国军官和士兵也被空投到这两省，他们利用当地的一些地方作为根据地，收罗零星藏在丛林中的武装匪徒，加以装备，并把他们伪装作
  “王国部队”。据不完全统计，从停战以来，这些武装部队曾向寮国战斗部队进攻了三十一次，进行了好几次劫掠和暗杀，严重地侵犯了上述两省居民的生命和财产。
    信件指出：此外，在老挝王国政府统治的地区如巴沙、孟农和北新，曾经发生过许多次对于那些曾参加爱国战争的人们实行报复的行动。这些破坏停战协定的行为加剧了老挝的紧张形势，使情况更为复杂，因而影响着双方的谈判。
    面对着这样的形势，为了使目前的政治会议得到成功和满足老挝人民的共同愿望，苏发努冯亲王建议老挝王国政府命令立刻停止对寮国战斗部队进行敌对的军事行动，并采取适当的措施制止王国政府在各地的部属所进行的非法活动。在寮国战斗部队方面，苏发努冯亲王重申它毫不动摇的立场，那就是始终要找出办法以避免一切冲突，严格地执行老挝停战协定。
    苏发努冯亲王在信里还建议：老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队各自命令它们的参加政治会议的代表团讨论关于就停止军事敌对行动发表联合声明的问题。
