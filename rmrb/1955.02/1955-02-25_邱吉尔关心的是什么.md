Churchill's Concerns
Jiang Yuanchun

In a written reply to the House of Commons on the 23rd, British Prime Minister Churchill, disregarding the fact that Taiwan is Chinese territory, actually claimed: "There is a big difference between the coastal islands of China and the island of Taiwan."

What "difference"?

Churchill did not dare to specify. It seems that this man, who admitted in the House of Commons that he had a bad memory, is now deliberately trying to erase his own memory, trying to portray Taiwan as having an undetermined status. However, the "Cairo Declaration," which he personally signed, clearly acknowledged that Taiwan is Chinese territory and stipulated that it should be immediately returned to China after the war. Moreover, Churchill's government last August also recognized that the return of Taiwan to China had been accomplished.

Black characters written on white paper, these are solemn international treaties, promises of the British government. Although the current Churchill wants to tear up the former Churchill, international treaties remain effective. The Chinese people and all countries and peoples who respect international obligations believe that Taiwan, like the coastal islands, is Chinese territory, and this will never be changed by Churchill's double-dealing and fickleness.

Starting from his fabricated argument that there is a so-called difference between the coastal islands and Taiwan, Churchill also hinted that the British government has two different positions on Taiwan and the coastal islands. He said, "There is no question of our being militarily involved in the defense of the coastal islands, or indeed of needing us to participate in the defense of the coastal islands." The implication seems to be that the question of Britain being militarily involved in the so-called "defense" of Taiwan, or of needing Britain to participate in the so-called "defense" of Taiwan, does exist. Does Churchill want to drag the British people into the American military action to obstruct the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan?

British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Nutting said in New York on December 12th last year that if the Chinese people liberate Taiwan, Britain "will naturally be involved." Does Churchill want to confirm that what Nutting said is British policy?

If Mr. Churchill thinks he can scare the Chinese people in this way, he is making a mistake. If he wants to follow the United States in imposing war on the Chinese and British peoples, he should know the fate of war instigators.

In his written reply, Churchill also implied that he supports the United States' further encroachment on China's coastal islands. Echoing Dulles's words, he believes that because the Chinese people regard the coastal islands as stepping stones for the liberation of Taiwan, these islands should receive America's "natural concern." Churchill's roundabout support for every aggressive action taken by the United States makes it impossible to believe that the British authorities' desire for peace is sincere.

The Churchill government has recognized the People's Republic of China, but he disregards even the most basic international etiquette, repeatedly referring to the People's Republic of China as the "Chinese Communists," and equating the "Chinese Communists" with Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique of the Kuomintang. On the one hand, Churchill vilifies the Chinese people's just demands for the liberation of their own territory of Taiwan as "blatant clamoring," and on the other hand, he willingly degenerates, complimenting Chiang Kai-shek, the American puppet, as the so-called "Grand Marshal." He even eulogizes the so-called "friendship" forged by Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique and the American aggressor group in "opposing the Chinese Communists." He attempts to use this method to help the United States promote Chiang Kai-shek, to deceive the British people. All his plans, in the final analysis, are to create public opinion and find a basis for creating "two Chinas." Obviously, he has no interest in promoting Sino-British relations and maintaining peace, but expresses great concern for supporting American aggression.

Churchill openly violated the British people's desire not to participate in American interference in Taiwan's actions, and chose the opening day of the Bangkok Conference to carry out war intimidation against the Chinese people, clearly to cooperate with the American conspiracy to expand aggression and prepare for war by using the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc, to put pressure on the Chinese people, attempting to force the Chinese people to tolerate the American occupation of Taiwan, the division of Chinese territory, and the preparation for a new war.

It should be told to Churchill that there is no force in the world that can force the Chinese people to tolerate American aggression and not liberate their own territory of Taiwan. Churchill's current position can only damage Sino-British relations and make it clear to the Chinese people that Churchill is an accomplice in the American aggression against Taiwan.

    邱吉尔关心的是什么
    蒋元椿
    二十三日英国首相邱吉尔在给下院的一篇书面答复中无视台湾是中国领土的事实，居然声称：“中国沿海岛屿同台湾岛之间有着很大的区别。”
    什么“区别”呢？
    邱吉尔不敢具体说明。看样子，这个在下院里承认过自己记忆不好的人现在又在故意抹煞他自己的记忆，想把台湾说成地位未定。可是，他亲手签过字的“开罗宣言”上明明承认台湾是中国的领土，规定它在战后应该立即归还给中国，并且，邱吉尔的政府在去年八月还承认台湾归还中国的事已经做到了。
    白纸上写下黑字，这些都是国际间的庄严条约，是英国政府的诺言。尽管现在的邱吉尔想撕毁从前的邱吉尔，但是，国际条约却照样有效。中国人民和所有尊重国际义务的国家和人民都认为台湾和沿海岛屿一样，是中国的领土，绝不会因为邱吉尔的两面三刀、反复无常而有所改变。
    邱吉尔从他杜撰的沿海岛屿同台湾有所谓区别的论据出发，还暗示英国政府在对台湾和沿海岛屿上有两种不同的立场。他说，“并不存在我们在军事上牵连到沿海岛屿的防御中去、或是的确需要我们参加沿海岛屿的防御的问题。”言下之意好像英国在军事上牵连到台湾的所谓“防御”中去、或是需要英国参加台湾的所谓“防御”的问题是存在的。邱吉尔想把英国人民拖进美国阻挠中国人民解放台湾的军事行动中去么？
    英国外交副大臣纳丁去年十二月十二日在纽约说，如果中国人民解放台湾，英国“当然将会卷进去”。邱吉尔想证实纳丁所说的就是英国的政策么？
    如果邱吉尔先生以为他可以这样来吓倒中国人民，他就是打错了主意。如果他想跟着美国把战争强加在中国人民和英国人民头上，他应该知道战争挑拨者的下场。
    邱吉尔在他的书面答复中还暗示他支持美国进一步侵占我国沿海岛屿的行动。他学着杜勒斯的舌头，认为由于中国人民把沿海岛屿当作解放台湾的踏脚石，所以这些岛屿理应受到美国的“自然关切”。邱吉尔这样转弯抹角地支持美国所采取的每一步侵略行动，这就使人不可能相信英国当局的和平愿望是真诚的。
    邱吉尔政府是承认了中华人民共和国的，然而他却连最起码的国际礼节都不顾，口口声声地把中华人民共和国称为“中国共产党”，并且把“中国共产党”和蒋介石卖国集团的国民党相提并论。邱吉尔一方面把中国人民要求解放自己领土台湾的正义主张诬蔑为“大肆叫嚣”，另一方面又自甘暴弃，把英国人民称为是美国傀儡的蒋贼介石恭维为所谓“大元帅”。他甚至还歌颂蒋介石卖国集团和美国侵略集团在“反对中国共产党”中所结成的所谓“友谊”。他企图用这种方法来帮助美国提拔蒋介石，来蒙混英国人民的视听。他的这些打算，说来说去就是要为他制造“两个中国”造空气，找根据。显然，他对于增进中英关系、维护和平并无兴趣，而对支持美国侵略却表示甚为关心。
    邱吉尔公然违背英国人民的不要参加美国干涉台湾的行动的愿望，选择曼谷会议开幕这一天来对中国人民进行战争恫吓，显然是为了配合美国利用东南亚侵略集团扩大侵略、准备战争的阴谋，对中国人民施加压力，企图迫使中国人民容忍美国侵占台湾，割裂中国领土，准备新战争。
    应当告诉邱吉尔，世界上没有什么力量能够迫使中国人民容忍美国的侵略，不去解放自己的领土台湾。邱吉尔当前的立场只能损害中英关系，并且使中国人民清楚地看到：邱吉尔是美国侵略台湾的同谋者。
