Explanation on the Draft of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China (Abstract)
    Nie Rongzhen
    First, implementing a compulsory military service system aligns with the needs of our national defense construction and the demands of the broad masses of people.
    With the development of national defense construction, the Chinese People's Liberation Army will change from a voluntary military service system to a compulsory military service system. This is a major reform in our country's military system. This reform is based on the victory of the people's democratic revolution nationwide, the universally enhanced patriotism of the people, and the needs of modern national defense construction. This is a major event concerning the security of the motherland and the vital interests of the people.
      Since its birth on August 1, 1927, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has long implemented a voluntary military service system. The voluntary military service system of the Chinese People's Army is fundamentally different from the mercenary systems of capitalist countries and the Kuomintang reactionaries. Our volunteers, under the call and leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, possess a high degree of political consciousness. For the cause of the Chinese people's revolution, they disregard personal treatment and bravely fight without fear of sacrifice. The Chinese People's Army possesses such a political quality. All its members, whether soldiers or cadres, from the day they voluntarily join the army, are determined to fight to the end for the cause of the people's revolution, regarding service in the people's army as a revolutionary profession, and willing to serve in the army until they can no longer continue to serve. Many martyrs gave their lives in the revolutionary war, and their immortal feats are forever recorded in the history of the people. Many comrades suffered physical injuries and torments in the long war, but today they are still inspired by the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, and they are still working diligently with all their energy to build our great motherland into a socialist country. Our People's Volunteers completely subordinate their personal interests and personal future to the overall interests and great future of the people's revolutionary cause. This spirit of selfless sacrifice is very precious. This is the embodiment of the revolutionary needs and revolutionary will of the masses of people led by the Chinese working class. Therefore, they have received the support and love of the broad masses of people. It is no accident that the people praise their glory and regard them as the most beloved people.
    During the Chinese people's revolutionary war, in frequent combat environments, under the enemy's division and encirclement, and without a nationwide people's regime, if we had not adopted the people's voluntary military service system to establish, consolidate, and develop the people's revolutionary army, then it would have been completely unimaginable to persist in the revolutionary war until achieving nationwide victory. This proves that it was completely necessary and correct to adopt the people's voluntary military service system in the past.
    When the People's Republic of China was founded, Article 23 of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which served as a temporary constitution, stipulated "...prepare to implement a compulsory military service system at an appropriate time." This provision shows that the Chinese people, when they began to establish a national regime, had already given full attention to the issue of implementing a compulsory military service system; however, it was not possible to implement it at that time because the subjective and objective conditions were not yet mature enough.
    The situation now is different from the past. Implementing a compulsory military service system is not only a need for national defense construction, but also possible. First, we have now established a nationwide, consolidated people's regime. This not only provides the people with stable living and conditions for peaceful production, but also provides us with the conditions to implement conscription according to a certain plan. Second, regularly conscripting a certain number of conscripts and reducing the number of active-duty soldiers can free up more manpower, material resources, and financial resources to strengthen the country's economic construction. Third, the more important reason is that: because US imperialism is still not reconciled to its failure in our country, and continues to adopt an aggressive policy hostile to the Chinese people, occupying our territory of Taiwan, establishing many military bases around our country, and constantly carrying out military provocations against our country, constantly attempting to subvert our country and threaten our security. Therefore, we must recover our territory - Taiwan, and defend our security. This requires us to have sufficient reserve personnel, who can be mobilized at any time to victoriously smash the armed aggression of imperialism. If we continue to implement a voluntary military service system, although the number of active-duty soldiers remains large, we feel we have too many soldiers during peacetime. However, because there is no reserve of reserve personnel, we will feel that there are too few soldiers when the imperialists launch a war of aggression against our country. Fourth, from the perspective of the people, Article 103 of our Constitution stipulates: "It is the glorious duty of citizens of the People's Republic of China to perform military service according to law." The broad masses of people regard joining the Chinese People's Liberation Army to defend the motherland as supreme glory, and demand that they be given the opportunity to fulfill this civic duty. At the same time, it is fair and reasonable for male citizens to bear a few years of military service obligations on average according to age and other conditions, instead of concentrating the military service obligations on a part of the people as in the past. Therefore, in order to adapt to the new situation after the national victory, and also to meet the needs of national defense construction and the demands of the people, it is completely necessary to change the voluntary military service system to a compulsory military service system.
    Our compulsory military service system is also fundamentally different from the compulsory military service system of capitalist countries. Because our country is a people's democratic country, Article 20 of our Constitution stipulates: "The armed forces of the People's Republic of China belong to the people. Its tasks are to defend the achievements of the people's revolution and national construction, and to defend the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of the country." Our people go to their own army to take turns performing military service obligations in order to defend their own country and defend the interests of their own people. Therefore, military service in our country is very glorious, which is fundamentally different from the compulsory military service system of capitalist countries, which is to protect the rule of the bourgeoisie and the interests of a few people and be a tool for the bourgeoisie.
    Implementing a compulsory military service system is a major reform in the military system of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. It will have the distinction between conscripted soldiers and professional officers, and will also have the distinction between active-duty soldiers and reserve soldiers. Most of the soldiers in the original voluntary military service system will be demobilized and transferred to the reserve in batches over the next few years; at the same time, a part of them will be trained to become professional officers and continue to serve in the army for a long time. The government will give different amounts of production subsidies to the demobilized soldiers of the voluntary military service system according to their age of service in the army, and the local governments will help them solve the problem of employment, so that they can each settle in their respective careers and get what they deserve. This is a very appropriate measure. Because these volunteer soldiers participate in the people's army with a high degree of political consciousness, because they have received the long-term education of the Chinese Communist Party, and because they have rich experience in fighting against counter-revolution, they will more deeply appreciate the arduousness of the revolutionary cause, and they will cherish the fruits of the people's victory they have achieved by fighting together with the people against the counter-revolutionary forces. Therefore, when they are demobilized and transferred to various posts, they will also strive to maintain the glorious tradition and style of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, contribute their greatest strength, and participate in the work of socialist construction and socialist transformation. At the same time, they will be ready to respond to the call of the motherland and return to the army to serve once imperialism launches a war of aggression. Those who are trained to become officers and continue to serve in the army will continue to maintain and carry forward the glorious tradition of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and become the backbone of the army in the future, so that the active-duty soldiers will receive the education and edification of excellent traditions, and the old volunteer soldiers who are transferred to the reserve will become the backbone of the reserve soldiers, spreading the excellent traditions and styles of the Chinese People's Liberation Army among the reserve soldiers, so that the excellent traditions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army will be further promoted and carried forward.
    Second, the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China (Draft) is formulated based on our country's specific conditions and with reference to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union.
    We still lack practical experience in implementing a compulsory military service system. In the history of our country, although there was a conscription system from the Han Dynasty, it is an ancient thing and has lost its reference value today. The Kuomintang reactionary rule also promulgated a military service law, but it was not really implemented, and it was impossible to implement it under the Kuomintang reactionary regime. What the Kuomintang reactionaries implemented was only a conscription system, which left an extremely bad influence on the people of the whole country.
    The draft military service law we are now proposing is basically formulated with reference to the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's universal compulsory military service law is basically applicable to us. However, because our country's situation is not exactly the same as that of the Soviet Union, there are different provisions on several specific issues. With the continued development of our national construction and the continuous improvement of the people's material and cultural lives, our military service system will also be further improved.
    Third, explanations on several major issues in the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China (Draft):
    1. On the issue of military service obligations
    According to the provisions of Article 2 of the draft military service law, only male citizens have the obligation to perform military service, which means that female citizens generally do not have the obligation to perform military service. Why? Because we have considered that performing combat missions in modern warfare is extremely arduous and heavy, and every revolutionary soldier needs to have a strong body and lasting spirit, and female citizens are difficult to be competent for such tasks due to physiological reasons. In the past, the fact that women participated in the Chinese People's Liberation Army did exist, which was also a glorious contribution of Chinese women in the Chinese revolutionary war, but they mainly did political work, cultural work, medical work, and other technical work, rather than being incorporated into companies to directly engage in combat. Therefore, in determining military service obligations, in accordance with the current requirements for army building and taking into account the physiological characteristics of female citizens, female citizens are exempted from general military service obligations. As for wartime, the army needs to greatly increase various types of technical personnel, and some technical work can be done by women and will be done well. Therefore, Article 11 of the draft military service law stipulates: "The Ministry of National Defense has the right to register and count women who have received medical, veterinary, and other specialized technical training for reserve service, and may organize them to participate in collective training when necessary. In wartime, women who have received the above-mentioned training may be conscripted to serve in the army, and women who meet the conditions may also be given specialized technical training." The so-called other specialized technical training refers to techniques such as communication, meteorology, and translation. Such a provision is more appropriate.
    2. On the issue of the age of conscription and the term of service during peacetime
    Regarding the age of conscription for active duty, Article 15 of the draft military service law stipulates: "Male citizens who are 18 years old before June 30 of the conscription year shall be conscripted for active duty." The reason why the age of conscription for active duty is stipulated as 18 years old is because people who reach this age are basically physically mature and have begun to enjoy the right to vote as citizens. At the same time, starting military service at the age of 18, they will still be very young when their active duty expires, and it will not be too late to go home to work or study. Therefore, it is appropriate to stipulate the age of conscription as 18 years old. In fact, when registering for military service, those who are listed as 18 years old are already 18 years and 8 months to 19 years and 7 months old when the age of service is officially calculated.
    Regarding the term of active duty for non-commissioned officers and soldiers, Article 7 of the draft military service law stipulates: non-commissioned officers and soldiers of the army and public security forces shall serve for three years; non-commissioned officers and soldiers of the air force, coastal defense forces, and public security forces ships shall serve for four years; and non-commissioned officers and soldiers of the navy ships shall serve for five years. Is this time a bit long? The answer is not long. Because the soldiers of modern armies must have sufficient training time to better master modern military technology, and the cultural and technical level of our people is still low, and the training time needs to be a little longer; if the term of active duty is too short, not only will the training requirements not be met, but also the number of conscriptions and retirements each year will inevitably increase. At the same time, it will take several years to transfer and demobilize the existing volunteers and replace them with new conscripts, so as not to make the proportion of new recruits too large, affecting the combat effectiveness of the army. Therefore, it is suitable for our current situation to stipulate the term of active duty as three, four, or five years. As for why there should be a distinction between three, four, and five years, this is because the technology of the navy and air force is complex and training is not easy, so their term of active duty should be longer than that of the army.
    Article 10 of the draft military service law stipulates: "The term of reserve service for non-commissioned officers and soldiers shall be until the age of 40, and they shall retire after the expiration of the term." This is determined based on our country's population and the people's health. Because our country has a large population, it is appropriate to stipulate the highest age for reserve service up to 40 years old, and there is no need to go higher; however, in order to accumulate reserve personnel for wartime needs, it is also not appropriate to stipulate the term of reserve service too low.
    3. On the issue of calculating the age of service for transfers between military branches
    Article 8 of the draft military service law stipulates that the transfer of soldiers between military branches shall be executed according to the order of the Ministry of National Defense, and the term of service shall be based on the term of service of the latter military branch, and the time served in the previous military branch shall be continuously calculated. For example, if a soldier who has served in the army for one year is transferred to the air force, and the term of service for air force soldiers is four years, then he will serve in the air force for another three years to reach the end of his term.
    4. On the division of labor between the Military Service Committee and the Military Service Bureau
    The main responsibilities of the Military Service Committees at all levels are to plan the distribution number of conscripted soldiers, organize propaganda and mobilization, review and approve matters of exemption from active duty during peacetime, and plan for the resettlement and employment of veterans transferred to reserve service and retired, in accordance with the orders of the State Council and the decisions of the people's committees at all levels. The Military Service Bureau is a military organization that handles military service work. Its main responsibilities are to handle military service registration and statistics, handle specific matters of conscription, and manage the organization and training of reserve soldiers, etc. Therefore, both of these organizations are needed.
    5. On the time and place of conscription, etc.
    Article 18 of the draft military service law stipulates: national regular conscription shall be conducted in accordance with the order of the Ministry of National Defense from November 1 of each year to the end of February of the following year. The reason for stipulating that it be conducted within this time is that this time is the slack farming season, so that the conscription work will not affect agricultural production. The reason for stipulating a four-month conscription time is that our country has a vast area and different climates, and the time to enter the slack farming season is not uniform. Therefore, stipulating a longer time is convenient for all regions to arrange specific conscription times according to local conditions. The reason for stipulating a regular conscription time is to facilitate the unified replenishment and retirement of troops, and also to facilitate the unified training of troops. As for the country's conscription during wartime, it is not restricted by this time.
    In order to complete the regular conscription of active duty, military service registration must be carried out before conscription. The purpose of registration is to understand the quantity and quality of conscripted citizens and understand the family situation of conscripted citizens as the basis for conscription.
    Article 19 of the draft military service law stipulates: in order to facilitate conscription, the country shall use municipalities directly under the central government, counties, autonomous counties, and cities as conscription areas, and several conscription stations may be established within the conscription area as needed. This division of conscription areas is to combine with administrative divisions to facilitate the leadership of the conscription work by the local state administrative organs, and also to facilitate the conscription of conscripted citizens locally.
    Article 20 of the draft military service law stipulates: if a conscripted citizen needs to change the conscription area, he shall complete the transfer registration formalities before August 1 of the conscription year. This is because after August 1, it is close to the conscription time. If the conscripted citizen changes the conscription area at will, not only will the changes of the conscripted citizens make it impossible to formulate the conscription plan of the municipalities directly under the central government, counties, autonomous counties, and cities, affecting the entire conscription work; but also the military service bureaus of the municipalities directly under the central government, counties, autonomous counties, and cities will not have enough time to fully investigate the newly moved conscripted citizens, making it difficult to determine whether these conscripted citizens should serve active duty or be exempted from active duty during peacetime. Therefore, it is necessary to impose a restriction on the time for conscripted citizens to change the conscription area. However, if a conscripted citizen changes the conscription area due to the relocation of the whole family or due to serving in state organs and transferring jobs, he may not be restricted by this time.
    6. On the issue of the sole breadwinner of the family and the only son being exempted from active duty during peacetime
    We are currently unable to specifically propose a unified interpretation of the sole breadwinner of the family. The situation varies in different regions of our country, and it is difficult to make specific regulations. Therefore, Article 23 of the draft military service law stipulates that in such circumstances, the military service committees of the municipalities directly under the central government, counties, autonomous counties, and cities may review and approve the exemption from active duty during peacetime. The provision on exemption from active duty for the only son takes into account the customs of Chinese society and considers the understanding and relationship of the broad masses of people towards the family. At present, such a provision is more appropriate. The only son here refers to the only biological son. As for adopted sons and sons-in-law who marry into the wife's family, they cannot be regarded as only sons. Exemption from active duty is limited to peacetime. When the country mobilizes all necessary forces to strive for victory in the war, the peacetime methods will not be applicable.
    7. The reserve service of non-commissioned officers and soldiers
    The reserve service of non-commissioned officers and soldiers is divided into two categories according to military literacy: non-commissioned officers and soldiers who have completed active duty are transferred to the first category of reserve service; conscripted citizens who have not been conscripted for active duty in the conscription year, conscripted citizens who are exempted from active duty during peacetime, and women aged 18 to 40 who have registered for reserve service in accordance with Article 11 of the draft military service law are all incorporated into the second category of reserve service. In these two categories of reserve service, they are each divided into two classes according to age: those under 30 years old are the first class, and those under 40 years old are the second class. The second class includes people from the age of 30 to 40.
    The purpose of classifying and grading reserve service is mainly to fully understand the different military literacy and ages of all reserve soldiers, so as to conduct different degrees of training according to different military literacy and different ages during peacetime, and to prepare for conscription work during wartime.
    Reserve non-commissioned officers and soldiers must receive a certain amount of military training. Because if there is no necessary training during peacetime, it will not be possible to adapt to the needs of wartime. Specific implementation methods must be formulated separately, and after a period of trial implementation, the Ministry of National Defense will make specific regulations based on the experience gained. 8. The age of officers in active service and reserve service
    Article 34 of the draft military service law stipulates the maximum age for officers in active service and reserve service. Under normal circumstances, officers who have completed active service are transferred to the first-class reserve service, and officers who have completed the first-class reserve service are transferred to the second-class reserve service, and officers who have completed the second-class reserve service are retired. However, there are also some people who have not served in active service and have obtained the rank of reserve lieutenant after passing the examination. Therefore, the age of entry into service for reserve officers is not completely consistent. Similarly, the age at which active-duty officers begin to serve as officers is not completely consistent. Therefore, only the maximum age is stipulated, and the starting age is not stipulated.
    Officers with lower ranks have a lower maximum age of service, and officers with higher ranks have a higher maximum age of service. This is not only because it generally takes more years to obtain a higher rank, but also because the positions held by lower-ranking officers generally require a more fit body, and the age should not be too high, while higher-ranking officers require richer experience and military academic knowledge, and the age must be higher.
    The maximum age of officers serving in the navy and public security force ships is five years more than that of officers in the army, air force, and public security force. This is because the technology of the navy is more complicated, and the learning time needs to be longer, and the term of active service for naval soldiers is longer than that of the army and air force. Therefore, the general age at which they begin to serve as officers is also greater than that of the army and air force. At the same time, the main requirement for the physical condition of naval commanders is to be accustomed to sea life. Except for personnel on a small number of high-speed ships, the physical exertion is not as great as that of the air force. Therefore, the age can be higher.
    Among them, there are several items where the maximum age of active service and the maximum age of the first-class reserve service are the same, such as the lieutenant general of the army, air force, and public security force and the senior colonel, major colonel, and lieutenant general of the navy and public security force ships in Article 34. This is because some officers have been transferred to the reserve service without completing active service due to physical conditions or national needs, so the age of the first-class reserve officers is not higher than the maximum age of active service, and the reserve officers who are called back to the army to serve in wartime are generally the first to call the more fit first-class, and then the second-class when necessary. Therefore, the age of the first-class reserve officers should not be increased too high, and it is stipulated that the lieutenant general of the first-class reserve service should be up to 60 years old. According to the physical condition of ordinary people, it is difficult to continue to serve as an officer below the rank of lieutenant general above the age of 65. Therefore, the maximum age of the lieutenant general of the second-class reserve service is up to 65 years old. However, for a small number of senior generals and generals, because they have more experience, it is determined whether to continue to serve according to their physical condition, and the age can not be limited.
    9. Military training for students in senior high schools and above
    For the needs of national defense construction, a certain number of senior high school graduates must be conscripted every year to be trained in various military technical schools. At the same time, in order to strengthen the national defense concept of young students, enhance the physique of young students, and enable young students to lay a certain military foundation before conscription, it is necessary for students in senior high schools and schools equivalent to senior high schools to conduct military training. Article 53 of the draft military service law stipulates: "Students in senior high schools and students equivalent to senior high schools shall receive pre-conscription military training in schools." This training should be ordinary military training, and its content and time shall be separately stipulated by the State Council.
    In order to train a part of reserve officers in universities to meet the needs of national defense construction, Article 54 of the draft military service law stipulates: "Students in universities shall receive military training in schools and prepare to obtain the rank of reserve lieutenant and prepare to serve as lieutenant officers." The military training in universities should be conducted according to the needs of training a lieutenant officer, so as to prepare them to be incorporated into reserve officers or reserve technical officers after they graduate from universities, or to be assigned to the military system to serve as officers. The time and subjects of military training in universities shall be specifically stipulated by the State Council according to the needs of the army and the nature of the schools.
    The above is a brief explanation of several key points of the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China (Draft).
    Finally, it is hoped that the people's committees at all levels will seriously discuss the Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China (Draft) after receiving it and widely solicit the opinions of the people. At the same time, it is hoped that the people's organizations will take various feasible ways, such as organizing gatherings and literary and artistic activities, to vigorously publicize and educate the spirit of the draft military service law to the broad masses of people. This publicity and education work is very necessary. In particular, because the Kuomintang reactionary ruling group took the method of grabbing soldiers for a long time in order to carry out the anti-communist and anti-people counter-revolutionary war, which left an extremely bad influence among the people of China and was deeply hated by the people, and the broad masses of people have never had practical experience in implementing compulsory military service, it is impossible to dispel the possible concerns of the masses without carrying out extensive publicity and education. At the same time, after our country implements a compulsory military service system, the counter-revolutionaries will surely do everything possible to sabotage it, distort the military service law in various ways, fabricate various rumors, and even take various conspiratorial means in an attempt to create misunderstandings among the masses. Therefore, it is even more important to conduct in-depth publicity and education for the masses. We should call on the people of the whole country to be a hundred times more vigilant against the sabotage activities of the counter-revolutionaries, expose the conspiracies of the counter-revolutionaries in time, and give them severe blows, so that the people of the whole country unanimously support the implementation of the compulsory military service system to meet the needs of the socialist construction of our great motherland.

    关于中华人民共和国兵役法（草案）的说明（摘要）
    聂荣臻
    第一、实行义务兵役制符合于我国国防建设的需要和广大人民的要求。
    随着国防建设的发展，中国人民解放军将由志愿兵制改变为义务兵役制，这是我们国家在军事制度上的一个重大的改革。这一改革是以人民民主革命在全国的胜利、全国人民普遍提高的爱国主义热情和现代化的国防建设的需要为根据的。这是关系着祖国的安全和全国人民切身利益的一件大事。
      中国人民解放军从一九二七年八月一日诞生以来，长期地都是实行志愿兵制。中国人民军队的志愿兵制是与资本主义国家和国民党反动派的雇佣兵制根本不同的。我们的志愿兵是在中国共产党的号召和领导下，有着高度政治觉悟，为了中国人民革命的事业，不计较个人的待遇，不怕牺牲而英勇奋斗的中国人民的优秀儿女。中国人民军队具备着这样一种政治素质，它的一切成员，无论是士兵和干部，从他们自愿参军的一天起，就下定了决心为人民革命事业奋斗到底，把在人民军队中服务看成是革命的职业，愿意在军队中一直服务到他们不能继续服务的时候为止。许多先烈在革命战争中付出了他们的生命，他们不朽的功勋永远记载在人民的历史上；许多同志在长期的战争中身体受到了损伤和折磨，但他们今天仍然同青年们一样受着中国人民革命胜利的鼓舞，仍然是竭尽他们所有的精力兢兢业业地继续为把我们伟大的祖国建设成社会主义国家而努力奋斗。我们人民的志愿兵把个人的利益、个人的前途完全服从于人民革命事业的整体的利益和伟大的前途。他们这种忘我的牺牲精神是十分可贵的，这是中国工人阶级领导的人民大众的革命需要和革命意志的体现，因此，他们就得到了广大人民的支持和爱护，人民称颂他们的光荣，人民把他们看成是自己最可爱的人，这完全不是偶然的。
    在中国人民革命战争时期，我们在频繁的战斗环境中，处在被敌人分割包围的情况下，没有全国范围的人民政权，如果不采取人民的志愿兵制来建立、巩固和发展人民革命的军队，那么，要坚持革命战争一直到取得全国的胜利，就是完全不可想像的。这就证明在过去采用人民的志愿兵制是完全必要的和正确的。
    当中华人民共和国建国的时候，起着临时宪法作用的中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领第二十三条中规定了“……准备在适当时机实行义务兵役制。”这个规定表明，中国人民在开始建立全国性的政权的时候，就已经对于实行义务兵役制的问题给予了充分的重视；但是当时因为主观和客观的条件都还不够成熟，所以还不可能实行。
    现在的情况和过去不同了。实行义务兵役制不仅是国防建设上的需要，而且也是可能的。第一、我们现在已经建立了全国范围的、巩固的人民政权。这不但使全国人民都有了安定的生活和进行和平生产的条件；而且使我们有了按照一定的计划实行征兵的条件。第二、定期征集一定数额的义务兵，减少常备兵额，就能够更多地抽出人力、物力和财力加强国家的经济建设工作。第三、更重要的理由是：由于美帝国主义还不甘心它在我国的失败，还继续采取着与中国人民为敌的侵略政策，侵占我国的领土台湾，在我国的周围建立了很多的军事基地，不断地对我国进行军事挑衅，时刻企图颠覆我们的国家，威胁我国的安全。因此，我们必须收复我国的领土——台湾，保卫我国的安全。这就要求我们有足够的预备兵员，随时都可以动员起来，胜利地粉碎帝国主义的武装侵略。如果继续实行志愿兵制，虽然常备兵额保持很大，平时感到兵多，但是由于没有预备兵员的储备，到了帝国主义者向我国发动侵略战争的时候，就一定会感到兵员过少。第四、从人民群众方面来说，我国宪法第一百零三条规定：“依照法律服兵役是中华人民共和国公民的光荣义务。”全国广大人民都以参加中国人民解放军保卫祖国为无上光荣，要求给他们履行这一公民义务的机会。同时，男性公民按照年龄和其他条件平均地担负几年兵役义务，不像过去那样把兵役的义务集中到一部分人民身上，也是公平合理的。因此，为了适应全国胜利以后的新的情况，也为了适应国防建设的需要和全国人民的要求，将志愿兵制改变为义务兵役制是完全必要的。
    我国的义务兵役制与资本主义国家的义务兵役制也是根本不相同的。因为我们的国家是人民民主国家，我国宪法第二十条规定：“中华人民共和国的武装力量属于人民，它的任务是保卫人民革命和国家建设的成果，保卫国家的主权、领土完整和安全。”我国人民是为了保卫自己的国家，保卫人民自己的利益而到人民自己的军队中轮流担任兵役义务的。所以在我们的国家服兵役是十分光荣的，这就根本不同于资本主义国家的义务兵役制是为了保护资产阶级的统治和少数人的利益而去给资产阶级当工具了。
    实行义务兵役制是中国人民解放军军制上重大的改革，它将有义务兵役的士兵和职业军官的分别，也将有现役军人和预备役军人的分别。原来的志愿兵制的士兵在几年内将有大部分陆续分批复员，转入预备役；同时将有一部分培养成为职业军官，继续在军队中长期服务。政府对于复员的志愿兵制的军人，将按照他们在军队中服务的年龄发给不同数目的生产资助金，并由地方政府帮助他们解决就业的问题，使他们各安其业，各得其所，这是很适当的措施。由于这些志愿的士兵有着高度的政治觉悟而参加人民军队，由于他们受过中国共产党的长期的教育，由于他们有长期与反革命进行斗争的丰富经验，他们会更深刻地体会到革命事业的艰巨、他们会十分珍惜他们同人民群众一起与反革命势力搏斗所取得的人民胜利的果实。因此，他们在复员转到各个岗位上的时候，也会努力保持中国人民解放军的光荣传统和作风，贡献出他们最大的力量，参加社会主义建设和社会主义改造的工作。同时他们也将随时准备着一旦帝国主义发动侵略战争的时候，立即响应祖国的召唤回到军队中服务。培养成为军官继续留在军队中服务的人，将继续保持和发扬中国人民解放军的光荣传统成为今后军队中的骨干，使服现役的士兵受到优良的传统的教育和陶冶，转入预备役的老的志愿兵将成为预备役军人的骨干，在预备役军人中传播中国人民解放军优良的传统和作风，这样中国人民解放军优良的传统就会更加发扬光大。
    第二、中华人民共和国兵役法（草案），是根据我国的具体情况并参照了苏联的先进经验来拟定的。
    对于实行义务兵役制，我们还缺乏实际的经验。在我国历史上，虽然从汉朝起就有过征兵制度，但那是古老的东西，在今天已经失去参考价值了。国民党反动统治时期也曾颁布过兵役法，但是并没有真正地实行，在国民党反动政权下也不可能实行。国民党反动派实行的只是抓兵制度，在全国人民中留下了极深极坏的影响。
    我们现在提出的兵役法草案，基本上是参照苏联的先进经验来拟定的。苏联的普遍义务兵役法对于我们来说基本上是适用的。但是，由于我国的情况和苏联不完全相同，所以，在若干具体问题上又有不同的规定。随着我们国家建设的继续发展，人民的物质和文化生活的不断提高，我们的兵役制度也将会进一步地趋于完善。
    第三、关于中华人民共和国兵役法（草案）中几个主要问题的说明：
    一、关于兵役义务问题
    按兵役法草案第二条的规定，只有男性公民才有服兵役的义务，这就是说，女性公民一般地没有服兵役的义务。为什么？因为我们考虑到，执行现代战争的作战任务是极其艰苦和繁重的，每一个革命军人都需要有强壮的身体和持久的精神，而女性公民由于生理上的原因是难以胜任这样的任务的。在过去时期，妇女参加中国人民解放军的事实确是存在的，这也是中国妇女在中国革命战争中的光荣贡献，但她们主要是作政治工作、文化工作、医务工作和其他技术性质的工作，而不是编入连队，直接进行战斗。因此，在确定兵役义务时，根据当前的建军要求和照顾女性公民的生理特点，免除女性公民的一般兵役义务。至于在战时，军队中需要大量增加各种各类的技术人员，而有些技术性的工作是妇女所能担任、而且也会做得很好的。因此，在兵役法草案第十一条中规定：“国防部有权对受过医务、兽医和其他专门技术训练的妇女进行预备役登记、统计，必要时可以组织她们参加集训。在战时可以征集受过上述训练的妇女到军队中服务，也可以对条件适合的妇女加以专门技术训练。”所谓其他专门技术训练是指着通信、气象、翻译等技术来说的。这样的规定是比较合适的。
    二、关于平时起征年龄和服役期限问题
    关于现役的征集年龄，兵役法草案第十五条规定：“在征集年度的六月三十日以前年满十八岁的男性公民，应当被征集服现役。”现役征集年龄所以要规定为年满十八岁，是因为到达这个年龄的人，身体发育已经基本成熟，并已开始享有公民选举权利，同时，从年满十八岁起就服兵役，到现役期满后，还很年青，回家就业或者就学还不晚。因此，起征年龄规定为年满十八岁是适宜的。实际上在兵役登记时列为十八岁的到正式入伍起算役龄的时候已经是十八年零八个月到十九年零七个月的年龄了。
    关于军士和兵的现役期限，兵役法草案第七条规定：陆军、公安军的军士和兵服现役三年；空军、海岸守备部队、公安军舰艇中的军士和兵服现役四年；海军舰艇部队的军士和兵服现役五年。这个时间是否长了一些？回答是不算长的。因为现代军队的兵员必须有较充分的训练时间，才能够较好地掌握现代的军事技术，而我国人民的文化和技术水平现在还较低，训练时间就需要稍长一点；如果现役期限规定太短，不仅不能达到训练的要求，而且每年征集和退伍的数字必然加大，同时要把现有的志愿兵转换复员而以新的义务兵接替，也需要几年时间，才不致使新兵的比重过大，影响到军队的战斗力。因此，现役期限规定为三、四、五年是适合我国目前情况的。至于为什么要有三、四、五年的区别，这又因为海、空军的技术复杂，训练不易，故其现役期限应比陆军长一些。
    兵役法草案第十条规定：“军士和兵服预备役的期限到年满四十岁为止，期满后退役。”这是根据我国人口和人民的健康情况来确定的，由于我国人口众多，服预备役的最高年限，规定到四十岁为止是适当的，不必再高；但为了积蓄预备兵员，以备战时的需要，服预备役的年限如果规定过低，也是不适宜的。
    三、关于军种间的调动计算役龄的问题
    兵役法草案第八条规定士兵作军种间的调动应按国防部的命令执行，其服役年限按后一军种的服役年限为准，并将在前一军种已服役的时间连续地计算进去。例如在陆军已服役一年的士兵调到空军，空军士兵的服役期限是四年，这样他在空军再服役三年就期满了。
    四、关于兵役委员会和兵役局的分工问题
    各级兵役委员会的主要职责是按照国务院的命令和地方各级人民委员会的决定，计划征集兵员的分配数目，组织宣传动员，审查和批准平时免服现役的事项，筹划对转入预备役和退役军人的安置和就业等工作。兵役局是办理兵役工作的军事机构，它的主要职责是办理兵役登记和统计，办理征集的具体事项，管理预备役军人的组织和训练工作等等。因此，这两个机构都是需要的。
    五、关于征集的时间、地点等问题
    兵役法草案第十八条规定：全国的定期征集，在每年十一月一日到下一年二月底的时间内按照国防部的命令进行。所以要规定在这个时间内进行，是由于这个时间正是农闲季节，不致因征集工作影响到农业生产。所以要规定有四个月的征集时间，是由于我国地区辽阔，气候不一，进入农闲时间前后不齐，因此，时间规定得长一些，才便于各地因地制宜地安排具体征集时间。所以要规定定期征集时间，是为了便于部队的统一补充和退伍，也便于部队统一地进行训练。至于国家在战时的征集，就不受这个时间的限制了。
    为了完成现役的定期征集，在征集以前必须进行兵役登记。登记的目的，是为了了解应征公民的数量和质量，了解应征公民的家庭情况，作为征集的依据。
    兵役法草案第十九条规定：为了便于进行征集，全国以直辖市、县、自治县、市为征集区，在征集区内可以按照需要设立若干征集站。这样划分征集区，是为了与行政区划相结合，便于地方国家行政机关领导征集工作，同时，也便于应征公民就地应征。
    兵役法草案第二十条规定：应征公民如果需要改变征集区，应当在征集年度的八月一日以前办妥转移登记手续。这是因为在八月一日以后，已接近征集时间，如果应征公民随便改变征集区，不仅由于应征公民的变动，会使直辖市、县、自治县、市的征集计划无法拟定，影响整个征集工作；而且使直辖市、县、自治县、市兵役局对于新迁来的应征公民，也来不及作充分地调查，这样就很难确定这些应征公民究竟应服现役或平时应免服现役了。因此，对应征公民更改征集区的时间，提出一个限制是必要的。但是，如果应征公民因全家迁居或因在国家机关服务和调动工作而改变了征集区的，就可以不受这个时间的限制。
    六、关于维持家庭生活的唯一劳动力和独子在平时免服现役的问题
    我们现在还不可能具体地提出一个关于维持家庭生活的唯一劳动力的统一的解释。我国各地的情况不一样，很难作出具体规定，所以在兵役法草案第二十三条中规定，凡遇此种情形，可由直辖市、县、自治县、市兵役委员会审查批准，在平时免服现役。至于独子免服现役的规定，是照顾到中国社会的习惯，从广大人民对家庭的认识和关系上来考虑的，在目前来说，这样的规定比较适当。这里的独子是指亲生的唯一儿子，至于过继的儿子和入赘的女婿，就不能算作独子。免服现役只限于平时，到了战时全国将动员一切必要的力量争取战争的胜利，平时的办法就不能适用了。
    七、军士和兵的预备役问题
    军士和兵的预备役，按军事素养分为两类：服满现役的军士和兵转入第一类预备役；在征集年度内未被征集服现役的应征公民、平时免服现役的应征公民和依照兵役法草案第十一条规定进行了预备役登记的年满十八岁到四十岁的妇女，都编入第二类预备役。在这两类预备役中，又各按年龄分为两等：三十岁以下的是第一等，四十岁以下的是第二等。第二等就是包括从年满三十岁起到四十岁的人。
    预备役分类分等的目的，主要是为了全面了解所有预备役军人不同的军事素养和年龄，以便在平时根据不同的军事素养和不同的年龄，进行不同程度的训练，并为战时的征集工作作好准备。
    预备役军士和兵都必须受一定的军事训练。因为如果平时没有必要的训练，就不能适应战时的需要。具体实施的办法还须另外拟定，并且试行一个时期以后，由国防部根据所得的经验再作具体规定。八、军官服现役和预备役的年龄问题
    兵役法草案第三十四条规定了军官服现役和预备役的最高年龄。按一般的情形是服满现役即转入第一等预备役，服满第一等预备役即转入第二等预备役，服满第二等预备役即行退役。但也有一些没有服现役经过考试合格而取得预备役尉官军衔的人，因此预备役军官的起役年龄不是完全一致的。同样地现役军官开始担任军官职务时的年龄也不是完全一致的，因此，只规定了最高年龄，而不规定起始的年龄。
    军衔等级低的军官服役的最高年龄较低，军衔等级高的军官服役的最高年龄就较高，除了因为一般地取得较高级的军衔需要更多的年限外，更由于较低级的军官所担任的职务一般地需要更精壮的身体，年龄不应当太高，而较高级的军官就需要更丰富的经验和军事学术的知识，年龄就必然高一些。
    海军和公安军舰艇中的军官服役的最高年龄都比陆军、空军和公安军的军官多五年，这是由于海军的技术比较复杂，学习的时间需要长一些，而且海军的士兵服现役的年限就比陆军和空军长，因此开始担任军官职务的时候，一般的年龄也比陆军和空军大。同时海军的指挥人员在身体上的主要要求是习惯于海上生活，除了少数高速度的舰艇上的人员外，体力的消耗不如空军那样大，因此年龄可以高一些。
    其中有几项现役的最高年龄和第一等预备役的最高年龄是一样的，如第三十四条中陆军、空军和公安军的中将和海军和公安军舰艇中的上校、大校和中将都是如此。这是因为有些军官由于身体情况或国家的需要等原因没有服满现役就转入到预备役了，所以第一等预备役军官的年龄，有些并没有超出现役的最高年龄，而到战时征召回军队中服役的预备役军官，一般是先征召比较精壮的第一等，必要时再征召第二等。因此第一等预备役军官的年龄就不应递增过高，而规定第一等预备役的中将到六十岁为止。按照一般人的身体情况六十五岁以上继续担任中将以下军官职务是有困难的，因此第二等预备役中将的最高年龄到六十五岁为止。但是对于少数的上将、大将，由于他们有着更丰富的经验，就根据他们的身体情况来决定是否继续服役，可以不限定年龄。
    九、高级中学以上学校学生的军事训练问题
    为了国防建设的需要，每年都须征集一定数量的高级中学毕业生入各种军事技术学校培养，同时为了加强青年学生的国防观念，增强青年学生的体质，使青年学生在征集前打下一定的军事基础，高级中学和相当于高级中学的学校的学生进行军事训练是必要的。兵役法草案第五十三条规定：“高级中学的学生和相当于高级中学的学生，应当在学校内受征集前的军事训练。”这种训练应当是普通的军事训练，它的内容和时间由国务院另行规定。
    为了在高等学校中培养一部分预备役军官，以适应国防建设的需要，兵役法草案第五十四条规定：“高等学校的学生，应当在学校内受军事训练，并且准备取得预备役尉官军衔和准备担任尉官职务。”高等学校的军事训练，应按培养一个尉官的需要来进行，以便准备在他们从高等学校毕业后编为预备役军官或预备役技术军官，或分配到军事系统担任军官职务。高等学校军事训练的时间和科目由国务院根据军队的需要和学校的性质来做具体规定。
    以上就是关于中华人民共和国兵役法（草案）几个要点的简单说明。
    最后，希望各级人民委员会在收到中华人民共和国兵役法（草案）后，认真地进行讨论并广泛地征求人民的意见，同时希望各人民团体采取各种可行的方式如组织集会和文艺性的活动将兵役法草案的精神对广大人民进行有力的宣传和教育。这种宣传教育工作是非常必要的。特别是由于过去国民党反动统治集团为了进行反共反人民的反革命战争，长期采取了抓兵的办法，在中国的人民群众中留下了极其恶劣的影响，为人民所深恶痛绝，广大人民从来没有实行义务兵役制的实际经验，如果不进行广泛的宣传教育，就不能打破群众可能发生的疑虑。同时，我国实行义务兵役制以后，反革命分子必将百般地进行破坏，对兵役法进行各种歪曲，造作各种谣言，甚至采取各种阴谋手段，企图造成群众的误解，所以对群众进行深入的宣传教育就更加重要。我们应该号召全国人民，对于反革命分子的破坏行为百倍提高警惕，及时地揭破反革命分子的阴谋，给予严重的打击，使全国人民一致支持义务兵役制的实行，以适应我们伟大祖国的社会主义建设的需要。
