    Tea Trees Bloom
    By Our Correspondent Liu Shiping
    In the winter of Xishuangbanna, the climate is still as warm as spring. The Dai youths living on both sides of the Lancang River gather in groups of three or five to bathe in the heart of the river when the sun warms the water. Even in places considered relatively cold by the local people, such as the famous Pu'er tea producing areas of Banna Menghai and Nannuo Mountain, the mountains are covered with bamboo forests and trees, appearing lush green. Butterflies flutter on the bright flowers in the gentle breeze.
    Xishuangbanna is the main producing area of Pu'er tea. According to historical records, the highest annual output once reached 32,000 dan. However, under the long-term exploitation of the Kuomintang reactionaries, it not only failed to develop further but regressed, gradually declining. By 1949, before liberation, the annual output had dropped to 3,000 dan. Most tea gardens were deserted.
    Before liberation, because tea was not valuable and taxes were heavy, some tea farmers cut down tea trees to burn as firewood or use as bedding for livestock. Many tea farmers were forced by life to open up wasteland for farming on mountain slopes dozens of miles away from their homes.
    In the five years since liberation, the Xishuangbanna Tea Factory of the Yunnan Provincial Tea Company has made continuous purchases, and the price of tea has gradually increased. In 1951, the price of one jin of tea was 1,500 yuan, and last year it had risen to 4,000 yuan.
    The autonomous region's tea experiment station and agricultural technology promotion station also provided technical guidance in Menghai and Nannuo Mountain, where tea production is more concentrated. By last year, the annual output had recovered to more than 16,000 dan.
    Tea Trees Bloom
    "Last year, the tea trees blossomed!" Comrade Jin Lisheng, the leader of the Nannuo Mountain team of the ethnic work team, told me excitedly. The tea trees had not blossomed for seven years. We counted and found that seven years ago was exactly 1948, when the big tea merchants, with Menghai as their activity center, colluded with the corrupt officials of the Kuomintang reactionaries, ignoring the lives of the tea farmers, lowering tea prices, and profiting from them. At the tea farmers' representative meeting held last October, the old tea farmers spoke with great sadness about the exploitation they had suffered in the past. At that time, the price ratio of tea to other goods was: one load of salt for ten loads of tea, one felt hat for one and a half loads of tea.
    Under the oppression of those bloodsuckers who specialized in exploitation and did not engage in production, the tea farmers' enthusiasm for production declined day by day. As a result, small tea trees became large tea trees, and fresh tea leaves grew into old tea leaves. The tea trees rotted and became infested with insects year after year, so naturally there was no question of blooming and bearing fruit.
    Since last year, the situation has undergone fundamental changes.
    Last December, within the seventy li from Menghai to Nannuo Mountain, I saw white flowers everywhere on the tea trees, full of the breath of spring. After arriving at the tea experiment station, I saw tea trees cultivated with scientific technology, growing short and vigorous, just like the small trees recently pruned along the road in the park, arranged in rows and columns, with the spacing between plants and rows very neat.
    On the famous tea mountain Nannuo Mountain, the production committee members of all ten villages on the mountain, along with young Hani girls and boys, were mobilized to plant tea trees. The farmers have already seen that planting tea can not only improve their current lives; it can also be exchanged for machines to support the construction of the motherland; growing tea to supply Tibetan compatriots can also strengthen national unity.
    In the fifty days from October 10th to the end of November last year, in the ten villages of Nannuo Mountain alone, 220 out of 334 households planted tea. The ethnic work team initially estimated that 7,331 jin of tea seeds were planted. According to the lowest estimate, if one-third survive, the number of tea trees in the future will exceed the existing number by more than one time.
    When I was in Nannuo Mountain in mid-December, the tea seedlings planted by the tea farmers according to the new methods taught by the tea experiment station were already more than an inch high; even those buried in nests according to the old method had already sprouted.
    Shuihe Village in Nannuo Mountain was a desolate and uninhabited place before liberation, and people called it Black Village. Now, the face of this Black Village has completely changed. There are fourteen households with ninety-two people living in the village, and twelve households have planted tea. One of them is the home of Sanbian, the leader of the women's group.
    I stayed at her house for two days. During those two days, it rained continuously, and cold winds blew into the bamboo building from time to time. We sat around the brazier on the floor, talking from the misty early morning until the sun set. When she compared the painful days of the past with the happy life of today, she said, "In the past, I cried three times a day; today, I laugh three times a day."
    Sanbian's mother sat by the brazier in the inner room, her face flushed red, and even the wrinkles on her forehead were invisible. She sighed deeply and said to herself, "Without the Communist Party, there would be no home for us."
    Sanbian took up her mother's words and recounted her family's experiences.
    Before liberation, because her father owed debts, he sold their five siblings to work for others. Her father went to Yunjinghong, ninety li away from home, to find work to support the adults and children left at home. He ran around many places and couldn't find a job anywhere. When he returned, he died of illness on the way. Her mother was left alone, carrying grain for others every day to earn money to support her three younger siblings. When they talked about this, they were all saddened that their father had not seen the happy days of today.
    After liberation, they all returned to their homes. The five siblings worked hard, reclaiming wasteland for farming. Last year, they turned their lives around. The whole family planted thirty jin of tea seeds. If one jin of tea seeds can produce 150 surviving plants, they will have 4,500 tea trees in three years. And this is a relatively low estimate. Their lives will also bear beautiful fruit like tea trees blooming.
    They have already built a new bamboo building, raised eight pigs, fifty chickens, and bought hoes, machetes, bedding, and blankets. Last year, they harvested eighty loads of dry rice (sixty jin per load), two and a half loads of soybeans, twenty jin of cotton, and received 450,000 yuan from picking spring tea. They also sold grain, and the summer and autumn tea was left at home.
    Their family, since Sanbian's eldest brother Sanluo got married, is now a family of ten. The three younger siblings have also grown up, and this year one of the younger brothers will go to the first elementary school in Nannuo Mountain to study. In their words, "This is something that has never happened in the history of the Hani people for generations."
    This elementary school was built by the Hani people living in Nannuo Mountain with their own strength.
    "When the elementary school was built last year, all the able-bodied people on the mountain were mobilized," Comrade Jin Lisheng of the ethnic work team said excitedly, pointing to the new school building standing on the hillside. "The Hani farmers are very keen to learn culture."
    For the sake of their children's education and to enable teachers to teach with peace of mind, everyone tried their best to connect bamboo tubes to form a water pipe, bringing water from the river ditch at the foot of the mountain to the school on the mountain.
    Last year, the Nannuo Mountain trade group transferred in twenty dozen pens. Some people estimated that they would not be sold and were afraid of causing a backlog, so they transferred thirteen dozen to other places. But the remaining seven dozen only had five pens sold to cadres, and the rest were all bought by the farmers.
    Improving Technology
    They not only showed a fervent desire to learn culture; they also demonstrated their intelligence and creativity in learning farming techniques.
    During the tea picking season last year, the work team helped Sanbian create the "double basket, double bag tea picking method." In the past, when they picked tea, they did not separate the coarse and fine tea leaves, but put them all together. Last year, when she picked spring tea, she separated the coarse and fine tea leaves and put them in two baskets and bags, which increased the efficiency of tea picking by one time compared to before and also increased the yield of tea.
    This advanced tea picking method has been promoted in the Nannuo Mountain tea area.
    Not only in the mountainous areas; but also in the dam areas, because of the help and education of the tea experiment station and the agricultural technology promotion station, the tea farmers are all learning tea planting and picking techniques like Sanbian.
    The tea farmers love their tea gardens as much as they love the jewelry on their heads. As long as you live in their home for a few days, you can deeply appreciate their feelings from their loud songs and hearty laughter. They sing about their tea gardens so enthusiastically:
      "Look how bright the sun is,
    Look at the beautiful scenery of the tea garden!
    How many tea-picking girls are there
    On this vast plain,
    Ah, the river water is clear, the well water is even cooler,
    Beautiful girls, your hearts are brighter than the moon.
    Increase production, for the prosperity of the country,
    The beautiful tea garden makes people ecstatic."
    In addition to the new tea gardens, the deserted tea gardens are also gradually being restored.
    One day, I met two comrades from the tea experiment station in Banpo Village on Nannuo Mountain. They were discussing with the comrades of the work team, wanting to find a deserted tea field by the roadside where everyone could see it, to prune and catch insects as a typical demonstration. Because the tea trees in Nannuo Mountain have been deserted for many years, many tea trees have leaves that have turned into withered branches and have many diseases and pests, so they cannot sprout. According to the experience of the tea experiment station, the old and withered branches and leaves must be pruned off so that the new leaves can sprout.
    In the plains of Menghai, the tea experiment station and the agricultural technology promotion station simultaneously opened whole-plant experimental areas, organizing tea farmers to visit and promote the cultivation techniques of tidying up tea gardens.
    According to the work team's estimate, Nannuo Mountain has restored 70% of its deserted tea gardens last year. Therefore, the yield of spring tea last year increased by 295 dan compared to the previous year.
      The Sun Comes Out from Beijing
    In Xishuangbanna, whenever people talk about today's changes, they often mention the opening of the Kunluo Highway. Since the car was opened to Menghai last June, Pu'er tea has been transported to foreign countries in batches. In particular, the "tight tea" processed and produced in the tea factory is transported to Tibet and is warmly welcomed by Tibetan compatriots.
    When the products have a way out, people's lives change accordingly.
    Chu Sai, a farmer from Shitou Village in Nannuo Mountain, pointed to the clothes he was wearing and said happily, "I have never worn machine-woven cloth before, but today I am wearing it; I used to climb mountains barefoot, but today I am wearing Warrior shoes." What a big change this is! The same labor yields ten times more income today than in the past.
    The comrades of the work team initially estimated that the income from tea picking in spring, summer, and autumn is enough for a tea farmer to eat. The income from grain and other sideline production can be used to expand production and further improve life.
    The tea farmers' purchasing power can also be seen from the operating conditions of the trade group. In March last year, the Nannuo Mountain trade group only had seven kinds of commodities, but by the end of the year, it had increased to sixty-two kinds, which was still not enough to supply. The agricultural tools used by farmers, whether hoes, sickles, or machetes, were quickly sold out as long as they were in stock.
    The same is true for daily necessities. Iron pots, tripods, and red cotton blankets have become out-of-stock goods. No matter which family you go to, people will take out their beloved red cotton blankets, spread them on the mats, and treat guests. Sometimes, the trade group does not dare to tell people in advance when things are delivered; they can only be distributed in fixed quantities according to needs. It is said that once iron pots were delivered, the trade group's house was so crowded that it was impenetrable. Some people quickly marked the bottom of the iron pot and rushed to order.
    The Hani people call their autonomous region "Gelanghe," which means happiness. They enthusiastically sing the praises of Chairman Mao for the good days they have never had for generations:
      "Chairman Mao! The sun is bright,
    The sun came in on July 15th (the Hani Autonomous Region of Gelanghe was established on this day in 1953), hey!
    The sun comes out from Beijing, hey!
    The sun is shining in our Hani area,
    The hearts of the Chinese people are the same, hey!"

    茶树开花
    本报记者　刘时平
    冬天里的西双版纳，气候还是温暖如春。住在澜沧江两岸的傣族青年们，每当日晒水暖，就三五成群，聚在江心洗澡。就是当地人民认为比较寒冷的地方，如著名的普洱茶产地——版纳勐海和南糯山上，也是满山遍野的竹林和树木，望去一片碧绿，蝴蝶随着清风在鲜艳的花朵上飞舞。
    西双版纳是普洱茶的主要产地。根据历史资料记载，最高的年产量，曾经达到过三万二千担。但是在国民党反动派的长期压榨下，不但没有继续发展，反而开倒车，逐渐衰落。到解放前的一九四九年，年产量竟下降到三千担。大部茶园荒芜了。
    解放以前，由于茶叶不值钱，捐税又重。有的茶农就把茶树砍倒当柴烧，或给牲口垫圈。许多茶农为生活所迫，只有到离家数十里以外的山坡上开荒种地去。
    解放后的五年来，云南省茶业公司西双版纳茶厂连年收购，茶价逐步提高。一九五一年一斤茶叶的价格为一千五百元，去年已提高到四千元。
    自治区政府的茶叶试验场同农业技术推广站还在产茶比较集中的勐海和南糯山进行了技术指导。到去年，年产量已经恢复到一万六千多担。
    茶树开花
    “去年茶树开花了。”民族工作队南糯山组的组长金丽生同志兴奋地对我说。茶树已经有七年没有开花。我们屈指算了一下，七年前，正好是一九四八年，以勐海为活动中心的大茶商同国民党反动派的贪官污吏勾结在一起，不管茶农的死活，压低茶价，从中渔利。老茶农在去年十月间举行的茶农代表会上谈起他们过去所受的压榨，十分伤心。当时茶叶同其他物品的比价是：一驮盐巴换十驮茶叶，一顶毡帽换一驮半茶叶。
    在那班专事剥削，不务生产的吸血鬼的压榨之下，茶农们生产情绪日益低落，结果是小茶树变成了大茶树，鲜茶叶长成了老茶叶。茶树一年一年地腐朽生虫，自然就谈不到开花结果了。
    从去年起，情况发生了根本的变化。
    去年十二月间我从勐海到南糯山的七十里地以内，到处看见茶树上的朵朵白花，充满着春天的气息。到达茶叶试验场以后，又看到用科学技术培植的茶树，长的又矮又蓬勃，就像是公园里路旁刚剪过的小树一样，条列成行，株行有距，甚为整齐。
    在有名的茶山南糯山，全山十个寨子的生产委员同年轻的哈尼族姑娘和小伙子们，都动员起来种茶树。农民们已经看到：种茶不仅可以改善自己眼前的生活；还可以换机器，支援祖国建设；种出茶叶来，供应藏族同胞，还能增强民族团结。
    从去年十月十日到十一月底的五十天内，光是南糯山的十个寨子，三百三十四户人家，就有二百二十户种了茶叶。民族工作队初步算了一下，种下去的茶籽有七千三百三十一斤。按照最低的估计，如果成活三分之一，将来茶树就可以超过现有的一倍。
    十二月中旬我在南糯山的时候，茶农们按照茶叶试验场教给他们的新方法种的茶树苗，已经一寸多高；就是照老办法一窝窝埋的，也已经出了芽。
    南糯山的水合寨，解放以前是一个荒凉无人烟的地方，人们都叫它黑寨子。现在，这个黑寨子的面貌完全改变了。寨内住着十四户人家，九十二口人，有十二户人家都种了茶。其中有一家是妇女组长三边的家。
    我在她家待过两天。那两天，连日下雨，冷风不时吹进竹楼，我们围着火盆，席地而坐，从晨雾迷漫的清早，谈到太阳落山。她在用过去的痛苦日子同今天的幸福生活对比时说：“过去的日子，一天哭三次；今天的生活，一天笑三回。”
    三边的母亲坐在里屋的火盆边，脸烤的通红，连额头上的绉纹也看不见了。她长吁了一口气，自言自语：“没有共产党，就没有我们这个家。”
    三边接住她妈的话，诉说着他们家的遭遇。
    他们一家人，在解放以前，由于爹爹欠了债，把他们兄妹五个人卖出去，给人家帮工。她爹为了留在家里的大人和娃娃活命，到离家九十里远的允景洪去找工做。跑了好多地方，到处找不到工作，回来时，病死在途中。留下她妈一个人，天天给人家背谷子，挣点钱养活三个小弟妹。他们谈到这里，都为爹爹没有看到今天的幸福日子感到伤心。
    解放以后，他们都回到了自己的家。兄妹五个人辛勤劳动，开荒种地。去年翻了一个大身。全家人种了三十斤茶籽，如果一斤茶籽可以成活一百五十株，三年以后他们就可以有四千五百株茶树了。而这是一个比较低的估计。他们的生活也将像茶树开花一样，结出美丽的果实。
    他们已经盖起新的竹楼，养了八口猪，五十只鸡，还买了锄头，砍刀，铺盖和毯子。去年收割了旱谷八十挑（一挑六十斤），黄豆两挑半，棉花二十斤，摘春茶分得四十五万元，又卖了谷子，还有夏、秋茶留在家里。
    他们的家，从三边的大哥三罗结婚以后，又是十口之家了。三个小弟妹也长大了，今年就要有一个弟弟进南糯山的第一个小学念书。用他们的话说：“这是在哈尼族的历史上世世代代没有过的事。”
    这所小学，是住在南糯山上的哈尼族人民用自己的力量亲手盖起来的。
    “去年盖小学时，全山能劳动的人都出动了。”民族工作队的金丽生同志指着屹立在半山坡上的新校舍，兴奋地说：“哈尼族的农民很喜欢学文化。”
    他们为了自己的子弟念书，使教师能够安心教书，大家想尽办法，把竹筒子接起来，接成自来水管，从山下的河沟里引水到山上的校舍中。
    去年，南糯山贸易小组调来二十打钢笔，有的人估计卖不出去，怕造成积压，调拨到别处十三打。但剩下来的七打却只有五枝卖给干部，其余的全部被农民买光了。
    提高技术
    他们不仅在学文化上表现了如饥如渴的愿望；在学习耕作技术上，也表现了他们的聪明和创造性。
    三边在去年摘茶的季节里，工作队帮助她，创造了“双箩双袋摘茶法”。过去，她们摘茶时，粗细茶叶不分，统统放在一起。去年，她摘春茶时，把粗细茶叶分装在两个箩筐和袋袋里，使摘茶的效率比以前提高一倍，并且增加了茶叶的产量。
    这个先进的摘茶法，在南糯山茶区已经推广。
    不只是山区；就是在坝区，因为有茶叶试验场同农业技术推广站的帮助和教育，茶农们也都像三边一样，学习着种茶、摘茶的技术。
    茶农们热爱自己的茶园，就像热爱自己头上的首饰一样。你只要在他们的家里住上几天，就可以从他们那嘹亮的歌声里，和爽朗的笑声中，深深地体会到他们的感情。他们是这样热烈地歌唱着自己的茶园：
      “你看那太阳有多亮哟，
    你看那茶园好风光！
    采茶的姑娘多少哟
    在这辽阔的平坝子上，
    啊，河水清哪，井水更凉，
    美丽的姑娘，你们的心比月亮还亮。
    增产呀，为了国家兴旺，
    美丽的茶园叫人欢喜若狂。”
    除了新的茶园以外，荒芜的茶园也逐步恢复起来了。
    有一天，我在南糯山半坡寨碰到茶叶试验场的两位同志，他们正和工作队的同志们商量，想在大家能看见的路边道旁，找一块荒芜的茶地，整枝捉虫，作典型示范。因为南糯山的茶树荒芜多年，许多茶树上嫩绿的树叶变成了枯朽的枝条，病虫害很多，不能发芽。根据茶叶试验场的经验，必须把枯老的枝叶剪掉，新生的树叶才能发芽。
    在勐海的平坝子里，茶叶试验场同农业技术推广站同时开辟了整株试验区，组织茶农参观，推广整理茶园的耕作技术。
    据工作队估计：南糯山在去年已经恢复的荒芜茶园，达到了百分之七十。因此，去年春茶的产量，比前年增产了二百九十五担。
      太阳从北京出来了
    在西双版纳，只要谈起今天的变化，就要常常谈到昆洛公路的通车。从去年六月间汽车通到勐海以后，普洱茶就成批成批地运销到国外。特别是在茶厂加工制作的“紧茶”，运销到西藏，受到了藏族同胞的热烈欢迎。
    物产有了出路，人们的生活跟着变了样。
    南糯山石头寨的农民初赛指着身上的穿戴，高兴地说：“过去从来没有穿过机器织的布，今天也穿上了；过去光着两只脚爬山，今天穿上了回力球鞋。”这是多么大的变化呀！同样的劳动，今天却比过去增加了十倍的收入。
    工作队的同志们初步算了一下，一家茶农，只要有春、夏、秋三季的摘茶所得，就可以够吃了。粮食和其他副业生产的收入，都可以用于扩大生产和进一步改善生活。
    茶农的购买力提高，也可以从贸易小组的经营情况看出来。南糯山贸易小组在去年三月间，只有七种商品，到年底，增加为六十二种，还是不够供应。农民用的农具，不管是锄头，镰刀，或者?刀，只要有货，很快就卖完了。
    生活用品也是同样情况。铁锅，三脚架和红棉毯，成为脱销的货物。随便到那一家，人们都会把自己心爱的红棉毯拿出来，铺在席上，招待客人。有时候，贸易小组运到东西，事先都不敢告诉人；只能按照需要定量分配。据说，有一次铁锅运到了，贸易小组的房子里挤的水泄不通，有的人就在铁锅的锅底上赶紧划上记号，争先订购。
    哈尼族的人民把自己的自治区叫做“格朗和”，那就是意味着幸福。他们为自己世世代代没有过过的好日子，热情奔腾地歌颂着毛主席：
      “毛主席哟！太阳亮，
    七月十五日（格朗和哈尼族自治区政府在一九五三年这一天成立）太阳进来啦，唉咦！
    太阳从北京出来了，唉咦！
    我们哈尼族地区太阳亮了，
    全中国人民的心是一样，唉咦！”
