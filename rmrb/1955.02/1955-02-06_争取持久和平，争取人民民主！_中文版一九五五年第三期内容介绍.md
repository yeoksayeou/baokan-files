The organ of the Information Bureau of Communist and Workers' Parties, "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Chinese edition, 1955, Issue 3, has been published.

This issue publishes an editorial entitled "Leninism – A Vital and Great Doctrine." The editorial points out: Leninism is a great doctrine of international significance for the working people of the world and a powerful ideological weapon for Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries. Lenin's thought has had a tremendous influence on the entire course of world history, mobilizing and uniting the broad masses of working people throughout the world to fight for peace, freedom, democracy, and socialism, and for the victory of a new life. However, the enemies of peace, democracy, and socialism vainly try to prevent the spread of Lenin's ideas and weaken their influence on the masses. At present, all reactionary and war forces, headed by the American aggressors, are gathered under the sinister anti-communist banner to oppose all new and progressive things. The editorial emphasizes: Armed with the immortal doctrine of Leninism, the Communist and Workers' Parties steadfastly oppose the international reactionary forces and the malicious imperialist and war ideologies. The Communist and Workers' Parties thoroughly expose the plots and schemes of the American atomic maniacs and their partners, and expose their completely anti-people policies of deception and violence, and their policies of preparing for a new world war. No force in the world can stop the victorious advance of Lenin's ideas. The undying radiance of Lenin's thought shines ever brighter on the path forward for the people of all countries.

Important articles published in this issue include: "The Struggle of Communists for Freedom, Peace, and Socialism" by Palmiro Togliatti, General Secretary of the Italian Communist Party, and "The Brazilian Communist Party's Struggle for Peace, Freedom, and the Independence of the Motherland" by Luís Carlos Prestes, General Secretary of the Brazilian Communist Party, etc.

Togliatti's article is an excerpt from his report at the Fourth National Congress of the Italian Communist Party on January 9. The article summarizes the main achievements of the Italian Communist Party since the Seventh Party Congress, points out the imperialist conspiracy to create international tension, and talks about the party's current tasks. The article emphasizes: The situation we face today has become more serious and more tense. The first action of our National Congress is to demand a thorough reform of our country's foreign policy. We demand a government of peace. We demand that the Italian government take concrete, peaceful, and proactive actions to ease international tensions, improve the peaceful lives of the people of all countries, and strengthen cooperation, thereby ensuring lasting peace in Europe and the world. While demanding a policy of peace, we also demand a policy of national independence. We must unite to demand the abandonment of atomic war plans and the implementation of a policy of peace.

Prestes's article is an excerpt from his report at the Fourth Congress of the Brazilian Communist Party. The article emphasizes: American imperialists are invading every corner of Brazil's economic, political, social, and cultural life. The Brazilian people, under the dual oppression of imperialism and feudal remnants, have become increasingly impoverished. Hatred for American oppressors has risen sharply throughout the country. The national democratic liberation movement led by the working class and the Communists has reached a new climax. The article continues: We are faced with a great struggle. Our people must not endure enslavement. We have realized that the coming struggle will be tenacious and arduous. But our people are invincible in the struggle for freedom and independence, and they are not isolated. Prestes also spoke in detail about strengthening the party's various tasks in political, ideological, and organizational aspects.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五五年第三期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五五年第三期中文版已经出版。
    本期以“列宁主义——生气勃勃的伟大学说”为题发表社论。社论指出：列宁主义是全世界劳动人民的具有国际意义的伟大学说，是各国共产党和工人党有力的思想武器。列宁的思想对世界历史的整个进程发生巨大的影响，它动员并且团结全世界广大劳动人民群众为和平、自由、民主和社会主义，为新生活的胜利而斗争。但是，和平、民主和社会主义事业的敌人徒然想阻止列宁主义思想的传播，想削弱它对于人民群众的影响。目前，以美国侵略分子为首的一切反动和战争势力集合在罪恶的反共旗帜下，反对一切新的进步的事物。社论着重说：以不朽的列宁主义学说武装起来的共产党和工人党坚定不移地反对国际反动势力，反对恶毒的帝国主义的和战争的思想。共产党和工人党彻底揭露美国原子狂人及其伙伴们的阴谋诡计，揭露他们的完全反人民的欺骗和暴力政策，准备新的世界战争的政策。世界上没有一种力量能够阻止列宁主义思想胜利前进。列宁主义思想的不灭光辉越来越明亮地照耀着各国人民前进的道路。
    本期刊载的重要文章有：意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂的“共产党人争取自由、和平和社会主义的斗争”，巴西共产党总书记普列斯特斯的“巴西共产党争取和平、自由和祖国的独立”等。
    陶里亚蒂的文章是他一月九日在意大利共产党第四次全国代表会议上所作的报告摘要。文章综述了意大利共产党自从第七次党代表大会以来的主要成就，指出了帝国主义制造国际紧张局势的阴谋，谈到了党在当前的任务。文章着重说：我们今天所面临的局势已经变得更为严重，更为紧张了。我们这次全国代表会议的第一个行动，就是要求彻底革新我国的外交政策。我们要求有一个和平的政府。我们要求意大利政府采取一种具体的、和平的创导性行动，以缓和国际紧张局势，改善各国人民之间的和平的生活，加强合作，从而保障欧洲大陆和全世界的持久和平。在要求和平政策的同时，我们也要求民族独立的政策。我们必须团结起来要求放弃原子战争计划，要求实行和平政策。
    普列斯特斯的文章是他在巴西共产党第四次代表大会上所作的报告摘要。文章着重指出：美帝国主义者正在侵入巴西的经济、政治、社会和文化生活的每个角落。在帝国主义和封建残余双重压迫下的巴西人民，已经一天天穷困。仇恨美国压迫者的情绪已经在全国各地急剧高涨。工人阶级和共产党人领导下的民族民主解放运动已经达到新的高潮。文章接着说：我们面临着伟大的斗争。我国人民决不能忍受奴役。我们已经认识到，即将到来的斗争是顽强的，艰巨的。但是我国人民在争取自由和独立的斗争中是不可战胜的，而且并不是孤立的。普列斯特斯还详细地谈到了在政治、思想和组织等方面加强党的各项任务。　　（新华社）
