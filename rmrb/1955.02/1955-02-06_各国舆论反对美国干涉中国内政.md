Soviet "New Times" Magazine Publishes Editorial Saying
    The United States Must Stop Interfering in China's Internal Affairs
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 5th: According to TASS, the "New Times" magazine published an editorial in its sixth issue calling for the United States to stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
    The editorial said: What is the essence of the issue currently being discussed by the Security Council? It is very clear from the bellicose remarks of senior US political and military leaders that the key issue is that the United States is attempting to seize territories that have been Chinese territories since ancient times. The purpose of the American militarists is to turn the Taiwan area into a military stronghold for attacking the People's Republic of China.
    The editorial further discussed the attitude taken by the ruling groups of New Zealand and the United Kingdom on the Taiwan issue. The editorial said: This attitude actually reflects their desire to support Washington's predatory behavior towards the People's Republic of China.
    The editorial emphasized that only the Soviet Union had submitted to the United Nations Security Council a draft resolution stipulating concrete measures to eliminate the threat to peace arising from the Taiwan area.
Mongolian "Truth" Newspaper Publishes Editorial Saying
    US Imperialism Should Immediately Withdraw from Taiwan
Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, February 5th: The Mongolian "Truth" newspaper published an editorial on the 3rd entitled "US Imperialism Get Out of Taiwan," condemning US imperialism for rudely interfering in China's internal affairs, obstructing China's liberation of Taiwan, and intensifying the tense situation in the Far East.
    The editorial said: After the Chinese People's Liberation Army liberated Yijiangshan Island, the aggressive actions of US imperialism intensified further. The United States concentrated a large number of naval and air forces in the Taiwan area. Recently, the US Congress passed a resolution granting Eisenhower the power to expand aggression against China, which further deepened the tense situation in the Far East and created a serious threat to peace and security in Asia and the world. US imperialism is wantonly interfering in China's internal affairs, attempting to occupy Taiwan forever, and turn it into a base for the United States to prepare and launch new wars in the Far East. Therefore, the United Nations Security Council should immediately discuss the issue of US aggression against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan area, and not the situation in the Taiwan Strait.
    The editorial went on to say that the Soviet Union's proposal to convene an emergency meeting of the Security Council to stop US aggression against China fully conforms to the wishes of peace-loving people all over the world, and the Mongolian people fully support the Soviet Union's position.
    The editorial said that both the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, which were signed by the United States and the United Kingdom, recognized that Taiwan is an inseparable part of China. Taiwan is China's sacred territory, and no intimidation or blackmail by US imperialism can stop the will and determination of the 600 million Chinese people to liberate Taiwan. The Mongolian people and all righteous people support the just act of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan and condemn the shameful aggressive actions of US imperialism. The editorial concluded by saying that the Mongolian people demand that US imperialism immediately withdraw from Taiwan—an inseparable territory of China.
Albanian Newspapers Say
    Liberating Taiwan is China's Internal Affair
Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 3rd: According to the Albanian News Agency, the "People's Voice" published an editorial on the 1st, commenting on Molotov's talks with Hearst and Smith and Sobolev's letter to the United Nations Security Council, saying, "The entire Albanian people wholeheartedly support the Soviet proposal, which expresses their desire to ease international tensions and safeguard world peace."
    The "Unity" newspaper's editorial wrote that every honest person knows clearly that liberating Taiwan is China's internal affair and an inviolable right, so the US aggressive actions in this region have no legal or moral basis. The newspaper said that the Albanian people condemn the US aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan area, which are the real cause of tension and great threats in this region. The newspaper concluded by saying that the Albanian people hope that the Security Council will take appropriate measures against the US aggressors.
Indian "Epoch Times" Publishes Editorial Saying
    The United States Should Be Held Responsible for the Dangerous Situation in the Taiwan Area
Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 5th: The Indian "Epoch Times" published an editorial on the 3rd, commenting on the United Nations' conspiracy to invite China to participate in the Security Council's discussion of a "ceasefire," saying, "This is indeed a strange invitation regarding arrangements for a ceasefire—one hand holding a gun, the other holding a pen to sign a treaty! It gives people the impression that it is like generously expressing a willingness to conclude a peace treaty with a defeated enemy!"
    The editorial said: "The main goal of the US government is to draw a ceasefire line in the Chinese seas and to forever separate Taiwan and Penghu, as well as the surrounding territorial waters, from China's territorial sovereignty. If a ceasefire can be forced under these conditions—under the auspices of the United Nations—then whenever China crosses the ceasefire line, not only the United States, but also the entire United Nations, will be dragged into the war."
    The editorial pointed out that the United States should be held fully responsible for the dangerous situation in the Taiwan area.

    各国舆论反对美国干涉中国内政
    苏联“新时代”杂志发表社论说
    美国必须停止干涉中国内政
    【新华社五日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科五日讯：“新时代”杂志第六期发表了一篇要求美国停止干涉中国内政的社论。
    社论说：安全理事会目前正在讨论的问题的实质是什么呢？从美国政界和军界高级领袖的好战言论中可以很明显地看出，问题的关键在于美国正在企图割取中国自古以来的领土。美国军国主义者的目的在于把台湾地区变为一个进攻中华人民共和国的军事据点。
    社论进一步谈到新西兰和英国统治集团在台湾问题上所采取的态度。社论说：这种态度实际上反映出他们希望支持华盛顿对中华人民共和国的掠夺行为。
    社论着重指出，只有苏联向联合国安全理事会提出了一个规定消除台湾地区所产生的对和平的威胁的具体措施的决议草案。蒙古“真理报”发表社论说
    美帝国主义应立即从台湾撤出去
    【新华社五日讯】乌兰巴托消息：蒙古“真理报”三日发表题为“美帝国主义滚出台湾去”的社论，谴责美帝国主义粗暴地干涉中国内政、阻挠中国解放台湾加深远东的紧张局势。
    社论说：中国人民解放军解放一江山岛后，美帝国主义的侵略行为更为加紧，美国在台湾地区集中了大量的海空军；最近美国国会又通过决议，授予艾森豪威尔对中国扩大侵略的权力，这就进一步加深了远东的紧张局势，造成了亚洲和世界和平和安全的严重威胁。美帝国主义横暴地干涉中国的内政，企图永远占领台湾，并且把它变为美国在远东准备和发动新战争的基地。因此联合国安全理事会应该立即讨论美国在台湾地区对中华人民共和国的侵略问题，而不是什么台湾海峡的形势。
    社论接着说，苏联关于要求召开安全理事会紧急会议、制止美国对中国侵略的建议，完全符合全世界爱好和平人民的愿望，蒙古人民完全支持苏联的这个立场。
    社论说，在美国和英国都曾经签字的开罗宣言和波茨坦公告里都承认台湾是中国的不可分割的一部分。台湾是中国的神圣领土，美帝国主义的任何恫吓讹诈都不能阻挡六亿中国人民解放台湾的意志和决心。蒙古人民和全体正义人类都支持中国人民解放台湾的正义行为，谴责美帝国主义的可耻的侵略行径。社论最后说，蒙古人民要求美帝国主义立即从台湾——中国的不可分割的领土撤出去。阿尔巴尼亚报纸说
    解放台湾是中国人民的内政
    【新华社布拉格三日电】据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，“人民之声报”一日发表社论评论莫洛托夫向赫斯特和史密斯发表的谈话和索波列夫致联合国安全理事会的信时说，“阿尔巴尼亚全国人民全心全意地支持苏联的建议，这个建议表示了他们要缓和国际紧张局势和维护世界和平的愿望。”
    “团结报”的社论写道，每一个正直的人都清楚知道，解放台湾是中国人民的内政和不可侵犯的权利，因此美国在这个地区的侵略行动是没有法律和道义上的根据的。这个报纸说，阿尔巴尼亚人民谴责美国在台湾地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行动，这种行动是在这个地区的紧张局势和巨大威胁的真正原因。报纸最后说，阿尔巴尼亚人民希望安全理事会对美国侵略者采取适当的措施。印度“划时代报”发表社论说
    美国应负台湾地区危险局势的责任
    【新华社新德里五日电】印度“划时代报”三日发表社论，评论联合国邀请中国参加安全理事会讨论“停火”的阴谋说，“这的确是一种奇怪的关于安排停火的邀请——一只手拿着枪，另一只手拿着签订条约的笔！这给人们一种印象，仿佛是对被击败了的敌人慷慨地表示愿意缔结和约似的！”
    社论说：“美国政府的主要目的是在中国海面划一道停火线，并且使台湾和澎湖以及它们周围的领海永远划在中国领土主权范围之外。如果能够在这种条件下——在联合国的主持下——强迫实现停火，那么不论什么时候只要中国越过停火线，不单是美国，而且还有整个联合国都将卷入战争中。”
    社论指出，造成台湾地区危险局势的责任完全应该由美国来负。
