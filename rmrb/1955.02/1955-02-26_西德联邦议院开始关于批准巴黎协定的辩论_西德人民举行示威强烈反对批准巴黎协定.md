Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 25th: According to a TASS report from Berlin: The West German Bundestag began its discussion on the ratification of the Paris Agreements on the morning of the 24th. The Bundestag decided to hold a second reading debate on the Paris Agreements on the 24th and 25th, discussing these agreements item by item. On the 26th, a third reading debate and final vote on the Paris Agreements will be held. If the outcome of the vote is favorable to Adenauer, the Paris Agreements will be considered finally ratified.

The debate on the 24th began with a speech by Social Democratic Party member Carlo Schmidt, who, on behalf of his parliamentary group, suggested that the Bundestag abandon the discussion on the Paris Agreements and instead strive to hold four-power talks on the German question. He emphasized the necessity of holding negotiations with the Soviet Union on a peaceful resolution of the German question before ratifying the Paris Agreements.

The Social Democratic motion was opposed by MP Kiesinger, speaking on behalf of the Christian Democratic Union-Christian Social Union parliamentary group. Kiesinger's speech reaffirmed that Adenauer and his cronies intend to stubbornly pursue the anti-national policy of implementing the Paris Agreements, thereby rejecting German reunification.

The reactionary majority in the Bundestag rejected Schmidt's proposal. However, it is noteworthy that, in addition to the Social Democrats, some members of the coalition government also supported their proposal.

Subsequently, the three main rapporteurs of the Bundestag's Foreign Affairs Committee – Fuller (Christian Democratic Union), Brandt (West Berlin branch of the German Social Democratic Party), and Freidel (Free Democratic Party) – delivered reports at the meeting.

Fuller's report concerned the "legal basis" of the Paris Agreements. But his report actually admitted that a component of the Paris Agreements, namely the so-called "German Treaty" (a treaty on relations between West Germany and the three Western occupying powers), deprives West Germany of its sovereignty. He demanded an increase in West Germany's military expenditure, because the 9.5 billion marks allocated annually in the budget would be insufficient for arming the country. Fuller also acknowledged that there were disagreements within the various committees of the Bundestag regarding various issues related to the Paris Agreements.

MP Freidel gave a report on the Saar Agreement, admitting that there were different opinions on this issue among and within the various parliamentary groups in the Bundestag.

Subsequently, the Bundestag began a general discussion on the Paris Agreements. Christian Democratic Union MP Kiesinger spoke first. His speech, in essence, attempted to prove, against all common sense, that German unity could be restored and peace consolidated through a "position of strength" policy based on the Paris military agreements. Kiesinger groundlessly insisted that the Soviet Union seemed to agree to hold such negotiations. He rudely slandered the German Social Democratic Party MPs.

German Social Democratic Party MP Wehner then spoke. He emphasized that four-power talks on the German question must be held before ratifying the Paris Agreements. Wehner pointed out that the Soviet Union's statement could not be ignored, saying that the issue of restoring German unity is a vital issue for Germany and should not be subordinated to the interests of establishing military blocs as stipulated in the Paris Agreements.

The discussion is continuing.

Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, February 25th: News from Bonn: A strong popular movement opposing the Paris Agreements, a terrifying atmosphere of suppression, and disagreements among parliamentary and government figures constitute the tense situation during the final discussion in the West German Bundestag on the ratification of the Paris Agreements.

According to Reuters, the West German Bundestag began its final debate on the Paris Agreements with increased police patrols on all streets leading to the parliament building. On the eve of the Bundestag's final debate, a thousand Hamburg youths held a torchlight procession to protest the rearmament of West Germany.

Reuters also reported that Bonn police, armed with water cannons, were preparing to disperse demonstrators who were reportedly gathering in the Ruhr industrial area to protest the ratification of the Paris Agreements at the parliament. The report also said that news had come from Dortmund and Wuppertal that fifty large vehicles carrying demonstrators were to arrive in Bonn on the 24th. Bonn police said: "We are prepared for trouble." Police have received orders to use water cannons and batons to disperse demonstrators if necessary. The West German authorities have designated a special area around the Bundestag where the public is not allowed, and it is guarded by Bonn police and fully armed police from many other cities.

Public opposition to the Paris Agreements has also affected some parties in the West German government coalition. For example, the "All-German Bloc" and the Free Democratic Party have firmly declared their opposition to the Saar Agreement in the Paris Agreements. To force the Free Democratic Party, the second largest party in the coalition government, to vote in favor of the Saar Agreement, Adenauer had a sharp conflict with the Free Democratic Party leadership on the 23rd. According to the West Berlin newspaper "Telegraph," Adenauer threatened the leaders of the Free Democratic Party that if the Free Democratic Party did not agree to the Saar Agreement, it would be expelled from the coalition government. However, the Free Democratic Party's parliamentary group, after holding a special meeting, reaffirmed its opposition to the Saar Agreement.

Some members of the parties participating in the coalition government have indicated that they will vote with the Social Democratic Party members against the entire Paris Agreements.

Because Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union holds 244 of the 487 seats in the Bundestag, and the parties participating in the coalition government together control more than two-thirds of the votes in the Bundestag, there is a perception that the ratification of the Paris Agreements is merely a preordained outcome. But in fact, the whole thing is not as simple and easy as Adenauer and the Paris Agreements' drafters and sponsors across the Atlantic see it. As the Bundestag began its final debate on the Paris Agreements, Adenauer was clearly feeling threatened by popular opposition and the breakdown of the planned parliamentary "unanimity."

### 西德联邦议院开始关于批准巴黎协定的辩论  西德人民举行示威强烈反对批准巴黎协定

    西德联邦议院开始关于批准巴黎协定的辩论
    西德人民举行示威强烈反对批准巴黎协定
    【新华社二十五日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：西德联邦议院在二十四日上午开始了关于批准巴黎协定的讨论。联邦议会决定在二十四日和二十五日举行巴黎协定的二读辩论，逐条讨论这些协定。二十六日举行对巴黎协定的三读辩论和最后表决。如果表决的结果有利于阿登纳，巴黎协定就将被认为最后批准。
    二十四日的辩论是以社会民主党议员卡洛·施密特的发言开始的，他代表他的议会党团建议联邦议院放弃关于巴黎协定的讨论，而要求为举行关于德国问题的四国会谈进行努力。他着重指出了在批准巴黎协定以前同苏联举行关于和平解决德国问题的谈判的必要性。
    社会民主党的动议遭到了代表基督教民主联盟—基督教社会联盟议会党团发言的议员基辛格的反对。基辛格的发言重新表明，阿登纳和他的那一伙人打算顽固地奉行执行巴黎协定、从而拒绝德国重新统一的反民族政策。
    联邦议院的反动多数拒绝了施密特的建议。然而值得注意的是，除了社会民主党人以外，属于联合政府的某些议员也支持他们的建议。
    接着，联邦议院外交委员会的三个主要报告人——富勒（基督教民主联盟）、勃兰特（西柏林的德国社会民主党组织）和弗来德尔（自由民主党）在会上做了报告。
    富勒的报告是谈巴黎协定的“法律根据”的。但他的报告实际上承认了巴黎协定的一个组成部分，即所谓“德国条约”（关于西德和三个西方占领国之间的关系的条约）是剥夺了西德主权的。他要求增加西德的军费，因为预算中规定一年九十五亿马克的军费，用来武装将要不够了。富勒还承认，联邦议院各个委员会内部对于有关巴黎协定的各个问题的意见是有分歧的。
    议员弗来德尔作了关于萨尔协定的报告，他承认，联邦议院各党团之间以及各党团内部对这一问题有不同的意见。
    随后联邦议院开始进行巴黎协定的一般性讨论。基督教民主联盟议员基辛格首先发言。他的发言归结起来，不外是不顾任何常识而企图证明：通过以巴黎军事协定为基础的“实力地位”政策，似乎可以恢复德国统一和巩固和平。基辛格没有根据地硬说，似乎苏联同意举行这种谈判。他粗暴地诬蔑德国社会民主党议员。
    德国社会民主党议员维纳随后发言。他着重指出，必须在批准巴黎协定以前举行四大国关于德国问题的谈判。维纳指出不能忽视苏联的声明，他说，恢复德国统一的问题是德国的切身问题，它不应该屈从于巴黎协定所规定的建立军事集团的利益。
    讨论在继续中。
    【新华社二十五日讯】波恩消息：强烈的反对巴黎协定的人民运动、恐怖的镇压气氛和议会及政府人士中的意见分歧，构成了西德联邦议院最后讨论批准巴黎协定时的紧张形势。
    据路透社报道，西德联邦议院是在各条通向议会大厦的街上增派了巡逻警察的情况下，开始最后辩论巴黎协定的。就在联邦议院最后辩论前夕，一千名汉堡青年举行火炬游行，抗议重新武装西德。
    路透社消息还说，波恩警察带着水龙准备驱散示威群众，据说示威者正在鲁尔工业区内集合，要到议会来抗议批准巴黎协定。消息还说，从多特蒙德和窝伯塔尔传来消息，有五十辆大汽车载着示威者要在二十四日到达波恩。波恩的警察说：“我们准备着有麻烦发生。”警察已经接到命令，在必要时用水龙和短棒驱散示威群众。西德当局已经在联邦议院四周划定了一个不许公众进入的特别地区，由波恩的警察和来自许多其他城市的全副武装的警察担任警戒。
    人民对巴黎协定的抗议也影响到西德政府集团的某些党派。例如，“全德集团”和自由民主党已经坚决宣布反对巴黎协定中的萨尔协定。为了迫使联合政府中的第二大党——自由民主党投票赞成萨尔协定，阿登纳同自由民主党领导方面在二十三日发生了尖锐的冲突。据西柏林报纸“电讯报”说，阿登纳威吓自由民主党的领袖们说，如果自由民主党不同意萨尔协定，就要把它逐出联合政府。但是，自由民主党的议会党团在召开了一次特别会议以后，再度申明它反对萨尔协定。
    参加联合政府的各党派中的一部分议员，表示要同社会民主党议员一起投票反对整个巴黎协定。
    由于阿登纳的基督教民主联盟在联邦议院的四百八十七席中占有二百四十四席，参加联合政府的各党派总共控制着联邦议院中三分之二以上的票数，因此人们抱有这样一种看法：巴黎协定的批准只是一个预定的结局。但是事实上，整个事情并不像阿登纳和大西洋对岸的巴黎协定制订人和赞助者所看来的那样简单和容易。在联邦议院最后辩论巴黎协定的时候，阿登纳显然已经感到人民反对和议会“一致”计划破灭的威胁。
