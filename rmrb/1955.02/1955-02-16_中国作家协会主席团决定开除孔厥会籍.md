The Presidium of the Chinese Writers Association held its 13th enlarged Presidium meeting on February 7th of this year. The meeting decided to expel Kong Jue, a member of the association, from membership for his behavior of toying with women and his extremely vile character. The full text of the resolution is as follows:

Recently, various parties have exposed to the Presidium of this association the following extremely ugly behaviors of Kong Jue, a member of this association, which involve toying with women, corrupting morals, and insulting the glorious title of writer: In July of last year, Kong Jue used base means such as material enticement to seduce a female Youth League member in Shenyang. In early August of the same year, after returning to Beijing, he again used similarly base means to engage in an ambiguous relationship with another female Youth League member. The above facts have been verified through investigation, and the victims have filed complaints with the Presidium of this association.

Kong Jue's extremely vile hooligan behavior has been consistent. As far back as the Anti-Japanese War, he committed serious errors in his relationships with women and was punished by the Party as a result (he was a member of the Chinese Communist Party at the time). However, he repeatedly committed errors in his relationships with women in 1945 and 1948. In 1951, he even resorted to prostitution in Shenyang. Later, he even went so far as to insanely seduce a female comrade while on the Korean battlefield. After these errors were discovered by the Chinese Communist Party branch of his organization, he was expelled from the Party in 1952. However, Kong Jue consistently refused to reform. During his time working in factories in the past year, he wandered around, using the name of "writer" to deceive and seduce young women. His decadent bourgeois ideology and lifestyle have degenerated to an extremely vile degree.

The Presidium believes that Kong Jue's degenerate behavior not only completely betrays the qualities that a writer should possess but also violates the morals of a human being. Our literary ranks must not tolerate such a person. Therefore, it is decided to expel him from membership.

The Presidium believes that the task of writers is to cultivate the noble qualities and socialist morality of the people through their works. The moral character of the writers themselves is of decisive significance in fulfilling this glorious task. Any behavior that corrupts morality is absolutely incompatible with the honorable title of writer. From the Kong Jue incident, we believe that the serious attention of writers should be drawn. We should resolutely oppose all phenomena of moral degradation in literary and art circles. We also call on all members to improve their political and moral standards and to fight for the purity of our ranks.

    中国作家协会主席团决定开除孔厥会籍
    中国作家协会主席团于今年二月七日召开第十三次主席团扩大会议，会议决定开除玩弄妇女、品质极端恶劣的该会会员孔厥的会籍。决议全文如下：
    最近各方面向本会主席团揭发了本会会员孔厥下列一些玩弄妇女、败坏道德、污辱作家光荣称号的极端丑恶的行为：孔厥于去年七月间在沈阳用物质哄骗等卑劣手段诱奸了一个女青年团员。同年八月初回到北京，又用同样卑劣手段与另一个女青年团员发生了暧昧的关系。上列事实经调查属实，并由受害者向本会主席团提出了控诉。
    孔厥这种极端恶劣的流氓行为是一贯的。远在抗日战争时期，他就曾在男女关系上犯过严重的错误，并因此受到了党的处分（他当时还是中共党员）。但他在一九四五年和一九四八年又连续在男女关系上重犯错误，一九五一年在沈阳时并曾去嫖妓。后来甚至疯狂到在朝鲜战场竟又丧心病狂地诱奸了一位女同志。这些错误经他所在机关的中国共产党支部发现后，在一九五二年将他开除出党。但是孔厥始终拒绝改造，在近一年来下工厂的时期，一面到处游荡，一面以“作家”的名义到处蒙混欺骗，玩弄青年妇女。他的腐朽的资产阶级思想意识和生活方式已经堕落到极端恶劣的程度。
    主席团认为孔厥这种堕落的行为，不仅完全丧失了一个作家应有的品质，而且也有背于为人的道德。我们的文艺队伍里决不能容留这样的人。为此决定开除其会籍。
    主席团认为，作家的任务是以自己的作品培养人民的高尚品质和社会主义道德，作家本身的道德品质对于完成这一光荣任务有着决定的意义，任何败坏道德的行为都是和作家这个荣誉的称号决不相容的。从孔厥的事件上，我们认为应该提起作家的严重注意，应该坚决反对文艺界一切道德堕落的现象。我们并号召全体会员提高政治水平和道德水平，为纯洁我们的队伍而斗争。
