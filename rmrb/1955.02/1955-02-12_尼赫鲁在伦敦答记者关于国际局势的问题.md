Xinhua News Agency, February 10th: According to Indian press reports: Indian Prime Minister Nehru held a press conference in London on the 9th, after the conclusion of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, answering some questions about the international situation.

Nehru said: "We find it very strange that the United Nations does not recognize the existence of a major country like China, but has a so-called representative of China who has nothing to do with China." He believes "this is unrealistic."

Nehru continued: "A strange situation has arisen. The United Nations discusses China issues without China's presence. It passes resolutions on China issues without China's participation. What is the result? Some other methods have to be used to get China to participate in the discussions, as in Geneva."

When Nehru spoke about the Goa issue, he said: If the Chinese government feels agitated about the Taiwan issue, then you can imagine how Indians feel about a part of India. He said that, unfortunately, the Portuguese government has not fully recognized the changes that have taken place in India.

When Nehru spoke about the developments in Asia, he emphasized that today's problem in Asia is what hundreds of millions of Asian people are thinking and what they are willing to do. He said that if people place too much emphasis on military considerations, then they will lose something even more valuable, which is the support of the people. And the support of the people is ultimately more important.

When a reporter asked about India's views on Middle East "defense," Nehru said: The proper way to consider defense is not to think about military aspects; there have been too many military considerations already. Even in wartime, people must consider the emotions of the people, the reactions of the people, and all other factors.

   尼赫鲁在伦敦答记者关于国际局势的问题
    【新华社十日讯】据印度新闻处消息：印度总理尼赫鲁在英联邦总理会议闭幕后，九日在伦敦举行记者招待会，回答了关于国际局势的一些问题。
    尼赫鲁说：“联合国不承认一个像中国这样的大国存在的事实，而有一个和中国没有任何关系的所谓中国代表，我们觉得这是非常奇怪的。”他认为“这是不现实的”。
    尼赫鲁接着说：“奇怪的局势产生了。联合国在没有中国的情况下讨论中国问题。它在中国没有出席的情况下通过关于中国问题的决议。结果是怎样呢？只好用别的一些办法使中国参加讨论，像在日内瓦一样。”
    尼赫鲁在谈到果阿问题时说：如果中国政府在台湾问题上感到激动，那么你们可以想像印度人对于印度的一部分作何感觉了。他说，不幸葡萄牙政府还没有十分认识到已经在印度发生的变化。
    尼赫鲁说到亚洲的局势发展，他强调今天亚洲的问题是几亿亚洲人民在想什么和他们愿意怎样作。他说，如果人们过分重视了军事的考虑，那么就会失掉更加有价值的东西，这就是人民的支持。而人民的支持终于是更为重要的。
    在记者问到印度对于中东“防务”的看法时，尼赫鲁说：考虑防务的妥当的方法是不去想军事方面，军事方面的考虑已经太多了。即便是在作战的时候，人们也必须考虑人民的情绪、人民的反应等一切因素。
