    Comforting the Defenders of Peace
    By Our Correspondent Lin Gang
    The venue for the celebration of the 37th anniversary of the Soviet Army and the comforting of the Soviet troops stationed in the Lushunkou area – the domed theater of the Lushun-Dalian People's Cultural Club – was filled with rows of soft chairs, where Soviet representatives and people from all walks of life in Lushun-Dalian sat shoulder to shoulder. Soviet soldiers in grass-green and black uniforms, generals with glittering gold epaulettes, how mighty and amiable you are! The medals on your chests are flowers in the hearts of people all over the world who live in peace. For a whole decade, while your brothers have rebuilt Stalingrad to be even more beautiful, and collective farms have celebrated bumper harvests time and time again, you, far away from your homeland, far away from your loved ones, have been guarding Lushunkou. You are guarding the Far East and world peace, you are great defenders of peace.
    The comforting meeting began. Commander Peng Dehuai walked to the podium. He couldn't speak for a long time – the applause continued for a long time. His speech praised the great friendship between China and the Soviet Union. When our republic was just born, when American aggressors were actively supporting Japanese militarist forces, and our Northeast was under serious threat of invasion, the Soviet government agreed to our suggestion that the Soviet army continue to help us guard this strategic stronghold; now that our national defense strength has grown rapidly and has become increasingly consolidated, the Soviet government has proposed to withdraw all Soviet troops stationed in the Lushunkou area before the end of May this year, and to hand over the various facilities of the naval base to our country free of charge. Has there ever been such a sincere, brotherly friendship in human history, in the history of international relations? Commander Peng Dehuai, on behalf of our government, our people, and Chairman Mao, expressed his heartfelt thanks and condolences to all the officers and soldiers of the Soviet army stationed in the Lushunkou area.
    After a burst of stormy applause, the venue returned to silence. The entire audience listened attentively to the firm voice of the representative of the Soviet troops stationed in the Lushunkou area. He said that as they are about to leave this hospitable country, the Soviet people believe that the defense of Lushunkou has been transferred to reliable hands, and the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army has the ability to defend the honor and independence of their motherland. The delegation brought a silk banner presented by Chairman Mao to the Soviet troops stationed in the Lushunkou area. "Presenting the banner" was a moving scene. The brass band then played the "Victory March," a majestic melody expressing a heroic and confident mood, and the flag guards escorted the banner to the center of the stage. The gold-edged red banner was embroidered with Chairman Mao's personally inscribed inscription: "The strong alliance between the Soviet Union and China is an invincible force and a reliable guarantee against imperialist aggression and for the defense of peace in Asia and the world." Commander Peng Dehuai and the Soviet commander shook hands tightly in front of the banner. This historic scene, eagerly captured by the photographers, reminded people of the thousands upon thousands of warm handshakes between Chinese and Soviet people over the years, beside steel furnaces, on construction sites, in classrooms, in the fields, and at the bases of future hydroelectric power stations. The world is paying attention to the increasingly consolidated friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union in all aspects. Expressing the sentiments of 600 million people, the delegation also brought a trainload of comfort gifts. Among the gifts were Sino-Soviet Friendship commemorative medals, exquisite comfort picture albums, specially made art commemorative handbooks, and various local specialties and handicrafts of our working people that enjoy international fame. These gifts have already been packaged and distributed to various Soviet troops. A ceremony for presenting the gift list was held at the meeting.
    The comfort meeting proceeded in a warm atmosphere. Every participant felt more and more that, at the moment of imminent parting, the friendship and solidarity between our two peoples were expressed even more vividly. Thousands of eyes in the venue sparkled with loving and reluctant farewells. This is a comfort meeting, a celebration meeting, and a farewell meeting. We are here to bid you farewell with a victorious and confident mood. Our people all know that the withdrawal of the Soviet army from the Lushunkou naval base is precisely because the strength of China and the Soviet Union has been unprecedentedly strengthened, and the unity of China and the Soviet Union has also been unprecedentedly consolidated. If the warmongers dare to launch a war of aggression, our two countries will support each other at any time to beat the aggressors black and blue. Now, Commander Peng Dehuai, on behalf of Chairman Mao, is awarding the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Medal" to the Soviet troops. Twenty-one Soviet officers and soldiers with outstanding merits came to the stage to receive the medals. Dear comrades, this exquisite brocade box contains a golden commemorative medal tied with a red ribbon. This precious souvenir, presented to each of you officers and soldiers in the name of our Chairman Mao, is cast with the most sincere feelings of 600 million people, please wear it on your chest forever. The comfort meeting is coming to an end, warm and joyful music rang out, and a group of young song and dance troupe members, holding flowers, crowded onto the stage, they presented flowers to the heroes and sent the blessings of the Chinese people to the Soviet army. Dear comrades, wish you a safe journey and send our regards to Moscow! I wish you new victories in defending communist construction. We will take on the responsibility of defending Lushunkou. Lushunkou stands majestically on the calm, blue sea. We must vigilantly guard the eastern gate of the motherland, and we must firmly guard this peaceful fortress on the Far Eastern frontier like a rock, we certainly can!

    慰问和平的保卫者
    本报记者　林钢
    庆祝苏联建军三十七周年慰问驻旅顺口地区苏军大会的会场——旅大市人民文化俱乐部的圆顶的剧场内，楼上楼下一排排软椅上，肩并肩地坐着苏军代表和旅大市各界人士。穿着草绿色和黑色军装的苏维埃战士们，金肩章闪闪发光的将军们，你们是多么威武，又多么和蔼可亲啊！你们胸前挂满了的勋章，是全世界过着和平生活的人民心上的花朵。整整十年了，当你们的兄弟已经把斯大林格勒重建得更美丽，集体农庄一次又一次地庆祝着丰收，而你们，远离祖国，远离亲人，守卫在旅顺口。你们守卫的是远东和世界和平，你们是伟大的和平保卫者。
    慰问大会开始。彭德怀团长走到讲坛前面去。他许久不能说话——掌声长时间地继续着。他的讲话颂赞了中苏两国的伟大友谊。当我们的共和国刚刚诞生，当美国侵略者积极扶植日本军国主义势力，我国东北有被侵略的严重威胁的时候，苏联政府同意我国建议，由苏军继续帮我们守住这一战略要塞；现在，我国国防力量迅速增长并已日益巩固，苏联政府就提出在今年五月底以前全部撤走驻旅顺口地区苏军，并将海军根据地的各种设备无偿地交给我国。人类历史上、国际关系史上，曾经有过这样真诚的、兄弟般的友谊吗？彭德怀团长代表我国政府、我国人民和毛主席，向驻旅顺口地区苏军全体将士表示衷心的感谢和慰问。
    一阵暴风雨般的掌声过后，会场又归于寂静。全场谛听驻旅顺口地区苏军部队代表的坚定的声音。他说，在他们将要离开这个好客的国家的时候，苏联人民相信：旅顺口的防卫转到了可靠者手里，英勇的中国人民解放军有能力保卫自己祖国的荣誉和独立。代表团带来了毛主席赠送给驻旅顺口地区苏军部队的锦旗。“赠旗”是一个动人的场面。铜管乐这时奏起“胜利进行曲”，雄壮的旋律表现着豪迈的、自信的情绪，护旗兵将锦旗护送到台中央。金边红底的锦旗上绣着毛主席亲笔署名的题词：“苏中两国强大的同盟是不可战胜的力量，是反对帝国主义侵略和维护亚洲及世界和平的可靠保证。”彭德怀团长和苏军指挥官在锦旗面前紧紧地握手。摄影记者们争着摄取的这个历史镜头，令人想起这些年来，在炼钢炉旁、在建筑工地、在教室、在田野和在未来的水力发电站的基地上，中国人和苏联人的千千万万次这样热情的握手。全世界都注意着中苏两国在各方面的友好合作关系的日益巩固。表示六亿人民的心意，代表团还带来了载满一个列车的慰问礼品。礼品中有中苏友谊纪念章，有精美的慰问画册，特制的美术纪念手册，有在国际上享有盛名的我国劳动人民的手工艺品和各种土特产。这些礼品已经封装分发到苏军各部队。大会上举行了赠送礼品单的仪式。
    慰问大会在热烈的气氛中进行着。每个参加者愈来愈感到，在行将离别的时分，我们两国人民的友谊和团结表现得更为生动了。会场内千百双眼睛里闪动着友爱的惜别的光辉。这是一个慰问大会，这是一个庆祝大会，这又是一个欢送大会。我们是怀着胜利和自信的心情来欢送你们的。我们的人民都知道，苏军从旅顺口海军根据地撤走，正是由于中苏两国的力量已经空前加强，中苏两国的团结也已经空前巩固。战争贩子要是敢于发动侵略战争，我们两国随时都会互相支援把侵略者打得头破血流的。现在，彭德怀团长代表毛主席向苏军部队授“中苏友谊章”。二十一位卓著功勋的苏军军官和士兵走上台来受章。亲爱的同志，这个精致的锦盒里装着金色的系着红佩带的纪念章。用我们毛主席的名义赠送给你们每一位军官和战士的这份珍贵的纪念品，是用六亿人民的最真挚的情意铸成的，请你永远把它挂在胸前。慰问大会快要结束了，热烈的欢乐的乐曲响起来，一群年轻的歌舞团员抱着鲜花拥上了主席台，她们把鲜花献给英雄，把中国人民的祝福送给苏联军队。亲爱的同志们，祝一路平安，问莫斯科好！祝你们在保卫共产主义建设中获得新的胜利。我们将要把保卫旅顺口的责任担当起来。旅顺口雄峙在平静的、碧蓝色的海上。我们要警惕地守卫住祖国东方的大门，要坚如磐石地守卫住远东前哨的这一和平堡垒，我们一定能够！
