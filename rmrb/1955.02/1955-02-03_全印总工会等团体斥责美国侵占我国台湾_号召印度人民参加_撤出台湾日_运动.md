Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 2nd:

    The All India Trade Union Congress, the All India Kisan Sabha, and the All India Students' Federation and other organizations recently issued statements and resolutions, denouncing the United States for encroaching on China's territory of Taiwan, and calling on their affiliated organizations to actively participate in the "Withdraw from Taiwan Day" to be held on February 6th, as decided by the All India Peace Council.
    The All India Trade Union Congress issued a statement saying: "Taiwan has always been an inalienable part of China's territory. The American armed forces in Taiwan are a threat to the People's Republic of China and a threat to the peace of the entire Southeast Asia. Every Indian should now, in accordance with the great principles stipulated in the Zhou Enlai-Nehru statement, demand the complete withdrawal of American troops from Taiwan and the nearby sea. No country shall interfere in the internal affairs of other countries." The All India Trade Union Congress called on its affiliated trade union organizations to actively participate in the "Withdraw from Taiwan Day" movement, hold joint conferences and demonstrations, pass resolutions demanding "non-interference in Taiwan," and send copies of the resolutions to the Indian Prime Minister, the All India Peace Council, and the US Ambassador to India.
    The All India Kisan Sabha also issued a notice to its affiliated organizations saying: The flames of war in Korea and Indochina have been extinguished one after another. Now, the United States is trying to use Taiwan to expand the war against mainland China. The All India Kisan Sabha calls on its affiliated farmer organizations to actively participate in "Withdraw from Taiwan Day" and pass resolutions demanding the withdrawal of US armed forces from Taiwan and its nearby sea.
    The Executive Committee of the All India Students' Federation also passed a resolution supporting the holding of "Withdraw from Taiwan Day." The resolution said: The United States' attitude towards the Taiwan issue is making Taiwan a dangerous place. The stationing of American armed forces on Taiwan Island and the signing of the US-Chiang military treaty have created the danger of a large-scale conflict. The resolution said that the undeniable fact is that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and no foreign country has the right to interfere in China's internal affairs.

    全印总工会等团体斥责美国侵占我国台湾
    号召印度人民参加“撤出台湾日”运动
  【新华社新德里二日电】全印总工会、全印农民协会和全印学生联合会等组织最近发表声明和决议，斥责美国侵占中国领土台湾，并且号召所属组织积极参加全印和平理事会决定在二月六日举行的“撤出台湾日”。
    全印总工会发表声明说：“台湾一直是中国不可分割的领土。在台湾的美国武装部队是对中华人民共和国的威胁，也是对整个东南亚的和平的威胁。每一个印度人现在应该按照周恩来—尼赫鲁声明中所规定的伟大原则，要求美国军队全部撤出台湾和附近的海面。任何国家都不得干涉其他国家的内政。”全印总工会号召所属各工会组织积极参加
  “撤出台湾日”的运动，举行联合大会和示威，通过要求“不得干涉台湾”的决议，并且把决议的副本送交印度总理、全印和平理事会和美国驻印度大使。
    全印农民协会也向所属各组织发出通知说：朝鲜和印度支那的战火已经相继被扑灭了，现在，美国正在企图利用台湾来扩大对中国大陆的战争。全印农民协会号召所属各农民组织踊跃参加“撤出台湾日”，并且通过决议要求美国武装部队从台湾及其附近的海面撤走。
    全印学生联合会执行委员会也通过决议，拥护举行“撤出台湾日”。决议说：美国对台湾问题的态度正在使台湾成为一个危险的地点。美国武装部队驻扎在台湾岛和美蒋军事条约的签订，产生了大规模冲突的危险。决议说，确定不移的事实是，台湾是中国不可分割的一部分，任何外国都无权干涉中国内政。
