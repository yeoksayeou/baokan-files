    This is the Time for the German People's United Struggle
    Tan Wenrui
    Germany is currently at a crucial juncture in its history. The enemies of Germany are exerting all their strength to impose the Paris Agreements, which revive German militarism, on the German people, in order to plunge Germany into a long-term abyss of division and war. The German people's desire for a unified nation is facing an unprecedentedly serious threat. In order to defeat this conspiracy, the entire German people are launching a massive struggle against the ratification of the Paris Agreements. The Presidium of the National Committee of the National Front of Democratic Germany has called on the residents of the German Democratic Republic to designate February 24, the day the West German Federal Parliament is scheduled to hold the second reading of the Paris Agreements, as a national struggle day against the ratification of the Paris Agreements. In the German people's struggle for national unification, the German Democratic Republic is a strong and reliable fortress for the German people.
    The government of the German Democratic Republic has been making unremitting efforts to restore the peaceful unification of Germany. On February 19, President Pieck published an article in the Soviet newspaper "Pravda," expressing his agreement with the Soviet government's proposal, taking into account the demands of Western countries and the West German Federal Government, to establish possible international supervision over all-German free elections. On the same day, Premier Grotewohl, in a speech at a mass rally in Berlin, called on all German people to unite against the Paris Agreements and strive to reach an all-German agreement. He specifically proposed that the two parts of Germany jointly or separately request the Four Powers to immediately hold a meeting to discuss the German question; in order to facilitate the convening of the Four Power conference, East and West Germany should reach an agreement on holding all-German free elections in 1955. The Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic also suggested to the West German Federal Parliament on the 18th that negotiations be held immediately to prepare for all-German elections. There is no doubt that this new initiative by the German Democratic Republic and the efforts made by the People's Chamber are entirely in line with the national interests of Germany, and it is the correct path for the German people to seek reunification and avoid another war for a long time.
    Restoring German unity is primarily a matter for the German people themselves. In the past, one of the obstacles that existed in the matter of holding all-German free elections was that Western countries and West Germany insisted on international supervision of all-German elections, but this obstacle no longer exists. The government of the German Democratic Republic has clearly announced that it agrees to international supervision of free elections, although it does not consider such supervision absolutely necessary. President Pieck pointed out: "The reason why we accept the international supervision of all-German free elections, which Western countries have always considered indispensable, is because the peaceful reunification of the German people in a democratic and independent country, and the maintenance of lasting peace in Europe, are the highest goals of our policies and activities."
    This constructive attitude taken by the German Democratic Republic for the sake of peace and the national interests of Germany has created new and favorable conditions for the German people to seek the peaceful reunification of their homeland.
    It is clear that if the West German Federal Government and the West German political parties also sincerely wish to seek the restoration of national unity on a peaceful and democratic basis, they should gladly seize this new initiative and immediately hold talks with representatives of the German Democratic Republic, which would greatly accelerate the restoration of unity and the signing of a peace treaty for their homeland.
    However, the Adenauer group in Bonn is hastily arranging to force the West German Federal Parliament to finally ratify the Paris Agreements. It is known that once the Paris Agreements are finally ratified, West Germany will be rearmed and become a shock force for the American ruling bloc and its followers against the peace-loving countries of Europe, including the German Democratic Republic. In this case, the restoration of German unity will become impossible. It is no accident that more and more West German political leaders have recognized this danger and have repeatedly pointed out that the Paris Agreements will deepen the division of Germany and thus increase the risk of a new war.
    In order to confuse public opinion, the Adenauer group insists that ratification of the Paris Agreements will not only not hinder effective negotiations on the restoration of German unity, but will also be conducive to the holding of negotiations. However, the powerful movement of broad sections of West Germany against the ratification of the Paris Agreements is the most powerful rebuttal to this lie by the Adenauer group. The "German Declaration" passed at the meeting held by people from all walks of life in West Germany in Frankfurt on the Main on January 29 clearly put forward the following demand: "Before the establishment of military blocs, an understanding must be reached between the Four Powers on the reunification of (Germany). Conditions that can be accepted by Germany and its neighbors can and must be found in order to guarantee the peaceful coexistence of European countries through German unification." The "German Declaration" has been warmly supported by the West German people. Communists, Social Democrats, trade union members, youth, and women all firmly support the national demands put forward in the "German Declaration" and have widely launched a signature campaign. This situation shows that the West German people's patriotic movement for unity and peace cannot be stopped by any force or any trick.
    President Pieck's statement and Premier Grotewohl's proposal on February 19 will greatly strengthen the confidence of all German people, especially the West German people, in striving for the peaceful reunification of the country. There is no reason why the two parts of Germany cannot sit down at a table to negotiate and reach an agreement on the issue of restoring German unity. Now is the time for the German people to unite and carry out a resolute struggle to remove the obstacles to reunification.
    If the rulers of West Germany, regardless of the efforts of the German people and the German Democratic Republic to achieve peaceful reunification, and the wishes of all the German people, proceed to ratify the Paris Agreements, they can only expose themselves as enemies of German unity in the face of the German people and all peace-loving people around the world.

    这是德国人民团结斗争的时候
    谭文瑞
    德国目前正处于它历史上的紧要关头。德国的敌人在竭尽一切力量要把复活德国军国主义的巴黎协定强加在德国人民的头上，以使德国陷于长期分裂和战争的深渊。德国人民要求统一的民族愿望遭受到空前未有的严重威胁。为了击败这种阴谋，全体德国人民正在展开反对批准巴黎协定的声势浩大的斗争。民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席团号召德意志民主共和国居民把二月二十四日，西德联邦议院预定要二读巴黎协定的日子，定为反对批准巴黎协定的民族斗争日。在德国人民争取统一的民族斗争中，德意志民主共和国是德国人民坚强可靠的堡垒。
    德意志民主共和国政府为争取恢复德国的和平统一，一直都在进行着不懈的努力。二月十九日，皮克总统在苏联“真理报”发表文章，表示同意苏联政府考虑到西方国家和西德联邦政府的主张而提出的建议：对全德自由选举建立可能的国际监督。同一天，格罗提渥总理在柏林群众大会的演说中号召全德人民联合起来反对巴黎协定，争取达成全德协议。他并且具体地主张德国两个部分共同或分别要求四大国立即举行会议讨论德国问题；为了便利四国会议的召开，东西德应就在一九五五年举行全德自由选举达成协议。德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团并已于十八日向西德联邦议院建议就准备全德选举立刻举行谈判。毫无疑问，德意志民主共和国方面这一新的倡议和人民议院所作的努力是完全符合德国的民族利益的，它是德国人民长期谋求恢复统一、避免再一次遭受战争的正确途径。
    恢复德国统一首先是德国人民自己的事情。过去，在举行全德自由选举的问题上一直存在着的一个障碍是，西方国家和西德坚持要对全德选举进行国际监督，现在这个障碍已经不存在了。德意志民主共和国政府明确宣布它同意对自由选举进行国际监督，虽然它认为这种监督并不是绝对必要的。皮克总统指出：“我们之所以要接受西方国家至今一直认为是必不可少的对全德自由选举的国际监督，是因为德国人民在一个民主的、独立的国家中和平地重新团结在一起，以及维护欧洲的持久和平，是我们的政策和活动的最高目标。”
    德意志民主共和国方面这一为了和平和德国民族利益而采取的建设性态度，为德国人民自己谋求祖国的和平统一创造了新的有利条件。
    事情很显然，如果西德联邦政府和西德各政党也同样地怀有谋求在和平和民主的基础上恢复国家统一的真诚愿望的话，就应该欣然抓住这个新倡议，立即同德意志民主共和国的代表进行会谈，这样将能大大加速他们的祖国恢复统一、签订和约。
    但是，波恩的阿登纳集团却在匆忙地安排强使西德联邦议院最后批准巴黎协定。人们知道，如果巴黎协定一旦获得最后批准，西德就将被重新武装起来，成为美国统治集团及其追随者反对包括德意志民主共和国在内的欧洲爱好和平国家的突击力量。在这种情况下，德国的恢复统一就将成为不可能了。越来越多的西德政治领袖认清了这种危险，他们曾一再指出巴黎协定将会加深德国的分裂，从而增加新战争的危机，这绝不是偶然的。
    为了迷惑公众舆论，阿登纳集团硬说批准巴黎协定之后不但不妨碍恢复德国统一进行有成效的谈判，而且还有利于谈判的举行。但是，西德广泛阶层反对批准巴黎协定的强大运动，就是对阿登纳集团的这种谎言的最有力的驳斥。西德各界人士在一月二十九日的美因河上的法兰克福举行的大会上所通过的“德国宣言”曾明确地提出这样的要求：“必须在成立军事集团之前，取得四国关于重新统一（德国）的协议的谅解。可以而且必须找到为德国和它的邻国所能够接受的条件，以便通过德国统一来保证欧洲各国的和平共处。”“德国宣言”已经得到西德人民的热烈支持。共产党人、社会民主党人、工会会员、青年、妇女，都坚决拥护“德国宣言”所提出的全民要求，并且广泛地展开了征集签名运动。这种情形说明，西德人民争取统一、和平的爱国运动是任何力量和任何诡计所阻止不了的。
    二月十九日皮克总统的表示和格罗提渥总理的建议，将大大加强全体德国人民，特别是西德人民争取国家和平统一的信心。德国的两部分没有任何理由不能够坐到一张桌子上来进行谈判，并就恢复德国统一的问题取得协议。现在是德国人民团结起来进行坚决的斗争，以扫除恢复统一的障碍的时候了。
    西德的统治者如果不顾德国人民和德意志民主共和国争取和平统一的努力，和全体德国人民的愿望，而迳行批准巴黎协定，他们就只能在德国人民和全世界爱好和平人民面前暴露他们是德国统一的敌人。
