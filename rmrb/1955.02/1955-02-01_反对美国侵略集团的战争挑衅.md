Czechoslovak Newspapers Say
"Ceasefire" Rhetoric Cannot Deceive World Opinion
Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 31st: Czechoslovak major newspapers - "Red Right," "People's Defense," "Free Word," "Youth Front," unanimously criticized on the 30th the provocative "ceasefire" proposal and open war preparations of the American ruling group, and supported the legitimate right of the People's Republic of China to liberate its territory Taiwan.

"Red Right" believes that the American "ceasefire" rhetoric is a direct provocation to the 600 million Chinese people, asking them to forever endure the American occupation of Taiwan "legally" and wait idly for the United States to attack mainland China. After summarizing a series of direct war preparations by the United States in the Far East, especially in the Taiwan Strait, the newspaper said that the United States has once again exposed its aggressor face, and the hypocritical "ceasefire" rhetoric cannot deceive world opinion. The newspaper then said that the American ruling group's blatant war provocations against the People's Republic of China prove that the United States is deliberately trying to exacerbate international tensions and realize its plan to dominate the world.

Referring to Premier Zhou Enlai's statement expressing the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan, "Red Right" emphasized that the Chinese people are prepared to sever the clutches of the new war instigators. The newspaper concluded, "All peace-loving countries deeply sympathize with the just determination and struggle of the Chinese people."

"People's Defense" warned that any attempt by the American armed forces to replay the Korean War scenario will inevitably end in the complete defeat of the aggressors. Bulgarian Newspapers Say
The Chinese People are Determined to Strike Back Against the Warmongers' Provocations

Xinhua News Agency, January 31st: According to the Bulgarian News Agency, Sofia, January 30th: "Fatherland Front" commented on the new aggressive actions taken by the United States against the People's Republic of China. The newspaper wrote that the dangerous policies adopted by the American warmongering group are creating an extremely great danger, first and foremost to themselves. The people's response to this provocation is to more closely unite their forces and fight against the atomic war provocateurs.

The international commentary in "Agricultural Banner" also commented on the American aggressive actions in the Taiwan area. The commentary wrote that the Chinese people are responding to the warmongers' provocations with their firm determination to liberate Taiwan. The provocations of the monopoly capitalists cannot deprive the Chinese people of their sovereign right to recover the occupied island, which has always been a part of Chinese territory. Albanian "People's Voice" Says
The American Aggressors' Intimidation and Blackmail are of No Use

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 31st: According to the Albanian News Agency, the Albanian "People's Voice" published a commentary on the 29th saying that the US Congress' authorization to Eisenhower to use force to interfere with the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and other Chinese islands is the most arrogant and shameless act of interference in the internal affairs of another country, violating the basic principles of international law. Taiwan is Chinese territory, and international treaties signed by the United States clearly stipulate this.

The newspaper pointed out that the American monopoly capitalists place all their hopes on force, intimidation, and blackmail. They believe that if they draw their swords, they will find no one to retaliate. However, their idea of overestimating their own strength has not been proven by history. This idea was not proven in Korea, nor has it been proven since.

The newspaper quoted Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's recent statement on the US government's interference in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan. The newspaper then said that the Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan and are firmly telling the American imperialists that they had better not play with fire. Indian Newspapers Point Out
American Occupation of Taiwan is a Threat to Peace in the Far East

According to Xinhua News Agency: The Indian "Amrita Bazar Patrika" published an editorial on January 29th entitled "Threat to Peace," commenting on the Taiwan issue: "The United Nations Charter clearly prohibits the United Nations from interfering in the internal affairs of any country. From the Chinese Communist point of view, Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. This view is not recognized by the United States, and Sir Eden, speaking on behalf of the British government, also dissented based on some convenient historical facts. Anyone who studies history will not accept the British Foreign Secretary's strange interpretation of Chinese history."

The editorial pointed out, "If there is a threat to peace in the Far East today, it is due to the US government's unwavering concern for the safety of the Kuomintang regime in Taiwan, which has lost its reputation. If the United Nations truly hopes to achieve peace in the Far East, it should immediately demand that the US government withdraw its protection." The editorial believes that "the US State Department is clearly determined to continue its policy of supporting the Kuomintang, hoping to use Taiwan as a fortress for the United States."

Commenting on the US Congress' proposed authorization for President Eisenhower to use military force to "defend Taiwan," the editorial pointed out: "It is clear that this proposal gives the president almost unlimited power that can be used arbitrarily, and the proposal may strengthen the position of those who believe in the effectiveness of force."

The editorial pointed out that British Foreign Secretary Eden's talk of a "ceasefire" "is merely a repetition of the American argument." It added: "So far, Britain has failed to make any real contribution to resolving the Taiwan issue." It said: "If Britain takes the initiative on this issue and tries to persuade its American allies to adopt a more realistic attitude towards Beijing, peace in the Far East may still be maintained."

The "National Herald" on January 29th also commented in an editorial on the British attitude towards the Taiwan issue: "The British Foreign Secretary opposes the use of force, but he cannot offer any practical solution." The editorial also pointed out that US Air Force units have been sent to Taiwan.

The "Glory" pointed out in an editorial on January 29th that the real purpose of the US ceasefire proposal is to try to separate Taiwan from China and, "through some form," place the island "under US occupation."

Commenting on the support of the United States' Western allies, including Britain, for the so-called ceasefire proposal, the newspaper said that there is no doubt that this proposal is in absolute violation of the decisions unanimously made by the United States, Britain, China, and the Soviet Union during World War II. "They signed a clear declaration stating that when the war ended and Taiwan was liberated from Japanese occupation, Taiwan would be returned to China. Moreover, if Taiwan is not part of China, then how could the United Nations and the United States continue to recognize the Chiang Kai-shek government in Taiwan as the 'Chinese government' after Chiang Kai-shek was defeated in China and retreated to Taiwan?"

The "Statesman" published on the 29th an article by its political reporter saying that Taiwan is part of China, and, as far as India is concerned, there is only one China. The reporter said that in any case, the current tension between Taiwan and the mainland is a continuation of the civil war. It is difficult to understand how external interest can be seen as anything other than foreign interference. Indonesian "Eastern Star" Published a Commentary Saying
The United States is Trying its Best to Turn Taiwan into a Base for Attacking China

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, January 29th: The Indonesian "Eastern Star" published a special commentary on the 27th written by its president, Effendi. The commentary supports Premier Zhou Enlai's statement on liberating Taiwan and opposing foreign interference. The commentary said, "We can understand this, and understand what is causing this national demand." The commentary went on to say that for a long time, the United States has been trying its best to turn Taiwan into an advanced base for attacking China. However, the United States has not realized that all its efforts are futile. The United States is unwilling to understand the true situation in China and is trying to get countries in the Far East to politically, economically, and militarily oppose China. Now, due to Eisenhower's request to use armed forces to "protect" Taiwan and other islands, the situation has developed to a more dangerous point. The diplomatic failures suffered by the United States in the past two years have forced it to take more violent measures - military measures - at the beginning of 1955. The commentary emphasized that a war in the Far East caused by the US attitude towards China can be prevented. The commentary placed great hope on the Asian-African Conference in preventing Western countries from implementing adventurous policies that are unfavorable to Asian and African countries.

    反对美国侵略集团的战争挑衅
    捷克斯洛伐克报纸说
    “停火”论调不能迷惑世界舆论
     【新华社布拉格三十一日电】捷克斯洛伐克各大报——“红色权利报”、“人民防线报”、“自由谈报”、“青年阵线报”，三十日一致指责美国统治集团的挑衅性的“停火”建议和公开的备战活动，支持中华人民共和国解放它的领土台湾的合法权利。
    “红色权利报”认为美国的“停火”论调是对六亿中国人民的直接挑衅，要他们永远忍受美国
  “依法”占领台湾，并且袖手等待美国进攻中国大陆。报纸在综述了美国在远东、特别是在台湾海峡的一系列的直接的备战活动以后说，美国又一次暴露了它的侵略者的面目，伪善的“停火”论调是不能迷惑世界舆论的。报纸接着说，美国统治集团对中华人民共和国进行的放肆的战争挑衅，证明美国是在故意设法加剧国际紧张局势，实现它的独霸世界的计划。
    “红色权利报”在谈到周恩来总理的声明所表示的中国人民解放台湾的决心时着重指出，中国人民准备斫断新战争煽动者的魔掌，报纸最后说，“所有爱好和平的国家深深同情中国人民的正义决心和斗争”。
    “人民防线报”警告说，没有疑问，美国武装部队想重演朝鲜事件的任何企图不可避免地将以侵略者的完全失败告终。保加利亚报纸说
    中国人民决心打击好战分子的挑衅
    【新华社三十一日讯】据保加利亚通讯社索非亚三十日讯：“祖国阵线报”评论了美国对中华人民共和国采取的新的侵略行动。报纸写道，美国好战集团所采取的危险的政策正在产生一种极其巨大的危险，这首先是对于他们自己的危险。人民对于这种挑衅的回答是，更加紧密地团结自己的力量，和原子战争挑拨者进行斗争。
    “农业旗帜报”的国际评论也评论了美国在台湾地区的侵略行为。评论写道，中国人民以解放台湾的坚定决心回答好战分子的挑衅行动。垄断资本家的挑衅不能够剥夺中国人民收复被占领的岛屿这一主权，这个岛过去和现在一直是中国领土的一部分。阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”说
    美国侵略者的恫吓讹诈无济于事
    【新华社布拉格三十一日电】据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道，阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”二十九日发表评论说，美国国会授权艾森豪威尔使用武力干涉中国人民解放台湾和其他中国岛屿的作法，是最蛮横、最无耻地干涉其他国家内政的行为，这种行为违反了国际法的基本原则。台湾是中国的领土，有美国代表签字的国际条约明确规定了这一点。
    这家报纸指出，美国垄断资本把他们的全部希望寄托在武力、恫吓和讹诈上面。他们以为，如果他们拔出剑来，他们将发现没有人会予以还击，然而他们这样过于相信自己的武力的想法还没有为历史所证明。这种想法在朝鲜并没有得到证明，在以后也没有得到证明。
    这家报纸引述了中国周恩来总理最近发表的关于美国政府干涉中国人民解放台湾的声明。报纸接着说，中国人民决心解放台湾，他们坚决向美帝国主义分子表明，美帝国主义分子最好不要玩火。印度报纸指出
    美国侵占台湾是对远东和平的威胁
    据新华社讯：印度“甘露市场报”一月二十九日以“对和平的威胁”为题发表社论，评论台湾问题说：“联合国宪章明白规定禁止联合国干涉任何国家的内政。从中国共产党的观点来看，台湾是中国领土的不可分割的一部分。这种说法没有为美国所承认，而且艾登爵士在代表英国政府说话时也根据某些方便的历史事实表示异议。凡是研究历史的人，谁也不会接受英国外交大臣对中国历史所作的奇怪的解释。”
    社论指出，“如果说远东今天有一种对和平的威胁，那么这种威胁就是由于美国政府一味关心台湾的声名扫地的国民党政权的安全而引起的。假如联合国真正希望实现远东和平，那它就应该立即要求美国政府收回它的保护”。社论认为，“美国国务院显然决心继续执行支持国民党的政策，希望利用台湾作为美国的堡垒。”
    社论在评论美国国会提出的授权艾森豪威尔总统使用军事力量“保卫台湾”的提案时指出：“很明显，这个提案给予总统可以任意使用的几乎是无限制的权力，提案可能加强那些相信武力的效力的人们的地位。”
    社论指出，英国外交大臣艾登所说的“停火”，“只是重复美国的论调而已。”它又说：“到现在为止，英国一直未能在解决台湾问题方面作出任何真正的贡献。”它说：“如果英国在这个问题上采取主动，并且设法说服它的美国盟友对北京采取比较现实的态度，远东的和平也许还可能保持下来。”
    一月二十九日的“印度民族日报”也在社论中评论英国对于台湾问题所采取的态度说：“英国外交大臣反对使用武力，可是他提不出什么切实可行的解决办法。”社论并指出美国空军部队已经派往台湾。
    “光荣报”在一月二十九日社论中指出，美国停火建议的真正目的是试图把台湾从中国割裂开来，并“通过某种形式”使这个岛屿“处在美国的占领下”。
    这家报纸在评论英国等美国西方盟国支持所谓停火建议时说，毫无疑问，这个建议是绝对违反美国、英国、中国及苏联等国在第二次世界大战期间一致作出的决定的。“它们曾签订了明明白白的宣言说，当战争结束，在从日本占领下获得解放后，台湾将归还给中国。况且，如果说台湾不是中国的一部分，那么，当蒋介石在中国被打败退到台湾之后，联合国组织和美国又怎能继续承认台湾的蒋政府是‘中国政府’呢？”
    “政治家报”二十九日刊登它的政治记者写的一篇消息说，台湾是中国的一部分，并且，就印度而论，只有一个中国。记者说，无论何种情况，目前台湾和大陆之间的紧张局势，是内战的继续。很难理解可以把外界的兴趣看作不是一种外国的干涉。印度尼西亚“东星报”发表评论说
    美国竭力把台湾变为进攻中国的据点
    据新华社雅加达二十九日电：印度尼西亚“东星报”在二十七日刊载了它的社长埃芬迪所写的特别评论。评论支持周恩来总理的解放台湾和反对外国干涉的声明。评论说，“我们能够了解这一点，以及了解是什么东西引起了这种全国的要求。”评论接着说，长期以来，美国一直在竭力把台湾变为进攻中国的前进据点。但是，美国没有认识到它的一切努力都是徒劳无益的。美国不愿意了解中国的真正局势，它正企图要远东的国家在政治上、经济上和军事上来反对中国。现在，由于艾森豪威尔要求使用武装部队来“保护”台湾和其他岛屿，这种局势已经发展到更为危险的地步了。美国在过去两年中所遭受的外交上的失败，已迫使它在一九五五年的开头采取更为暴戾的措施——军事措施。评论着重指出，由于美国对待中国的态度所引起的远东战争是可以防止的。评论对亚非会议在防止西方国家实行对亚非国家不利的冒险政策方面寄予了很大的希望。
