    We Must Conscientiously Study the Advanced Technology of the Soviet Union
    Fei Ping
    In order to improve and enhance technology in our country's industrial enterprises, and thereby further raise the level of enterprise production, it is necessary to: first, study the advanced technology of the Soviet Union; second, promote our country's existing advanced experiences; and third, solicit rationalization proposals aimed at the weak links in production. These three are interconnected and mutually supportive, and cannot be completely separated, but conscientiously studying the advanced technology of the Soviet Union is the most important link among them.
    Why must we conscientiously study the advanced technology of the Soviet Union?
    Taking the industrial enterprises that we are building and will build, which determine our country's destiny and are based on the 141 projects, they are all designed according to the latest Soviet technical standards, equipped with the latest Soviet machinery, and constructed and produced under the personal guidance of Soviet experts. Our cadres and workers are very unfamiliar with the technical requirements of these enterprises. If we do not study the advanced technology of the Soviet Union, do not implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, and do not organize construction and production according to Soviet design requirements, we will not be able to build these enterprises well; or even if the factories are built, they will not be able to carry out production smoothly.
    As for our country's original industrial enterprises, some of them have added a batch of new Soviet equipment and have been renovated; some of the enterprises, although their equipment is still the original, are responsible for producing part of the equipment and materials for the 141 new enterprises. If the cadres and workers of these enterprises do not study the advanced technology of the Soviet Union well and produce according to Soviet technical standards, the result will be either that the new equipment cannot function, or that the products they produce for the new enterprises will not meet the Soviet design requirements in terms of variety, specifications, and quality standards, and they will not be able to complete the task of supplying part of the equipment and materials to the 141 new enterprises. In many other existing enterprises, the current technical level is still very low, technical management is backward, the task of product variety is often not completed well, the quality of products is not guaranteed, and labor productivity cannot continue to increase. In short, it is often impossible to fulfill the national plan in a balanced and comprehensive manner. If these enterprises, according to their specific circumstances, conscientiously study and implement the advanced technical experience of the Soviet Union and strengthen technical management, they can gradually change their backward situation.
    In fact, the tremendous achievements we have made in industrial construction and industrial production in the past few years are mainly due to the fact that the broad masses of workers have responded to the Party's call, strived to study and implement the advanced technical experience of the Soviet Union, conscientiously implemented the suggestions of Soviet experts, and actively improved the technical management of enterprises. Taking Anshan Iron and Steel Company as an example, in terms of production, the annual output of the five blast furnaces of Anshan Iron and Steel now exceeds the highest annual output of the nine blast furnaces during the Japanese occupation; the annual output of a smaller steel plant now exceeds the highest annual output of the two steel plants during the Japanese occupation; labor productivity has increased significantly, the cost of steel has been greatly reduced, and the quality has also improved significantly, and people no longer call it "tofu-dregs steel" and "thousand-layer steel." These achievements are mainly the result of the workers' study of the advanced technology of the Soviet Union and the implementation of a series of technical reforms with the help of Soviet experts. In terms of capital construction, as everyone knows, thanks to the workers' conscientious study and implementation of the advanced technical experience of the Soviet Union and the implementation of the suggestions of Soviet experts, the technically complex and latest large-scale rolling mill and seamless steel pipe plant, the modern three blast furnaces and the second thin plate plant, have been quickly built and put into production smoothly. Several high-quality products that could not be produced domestically before, such as heavy steel rails and fishplates, No. 30 channel steel and many other large and small steel products, various seamless steel pipes, and several thin steel plates, can now be formally produced by Anshan Iron and Steel and supplied to the needs of national construction in large quantities.
    It should be very easy to understand that we must conscientiously study the advanced technology of the Soviet Union. However, some of our comrades have not yet fully realized this. The responsible comrades of Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory said in their work inspection that they once thought that production could be carried out according to the old methods of the old pneumatic tool factory, and locked the "technical design data" compiled by the Soviet Union in the safe, and did not organize cadres and workers to study it. When the factory organized workers to study the Soviet machine tool instructions, only more than twenty people in the whole factory signed up to participate, and most of the workers were unwilling to participate, thinking that "they can do the job without learning, relying solely on their own experience." On the other hand, some workers were immersed in research, intending to "invent" something. Some technicians were also thinking about creating a "Chinese-style riveting machine" or a "Shenyang-style riveting machine" all day long, and wanted to design a "multi-hole drill" that was not needed in the factory's production. Because they did not study and master the new technology well, accidents occurred constantly after they went to the workshop, work efficiency was very low, and some machines were even damaged. The Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory has learned this lesson and is now comprehensively studying the advanced technology of the Soviet Union. The mistakes of some cadres and workers in Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory are by no means accidental and isolated. Up to now, there are still some people who neither study the advanced technology of the Soviet Union nor look up to the existing advanced experience of our country, but only want to invent and create things themselves. Some people are "inventing" equipment and tools that already exist, and some people are "creating" advanced experience that has long been effective, and some people even want to "invent and create" monsters such as "automatic walking machines" that are neither needed nor possible. Such blind actions that waste time, manpower, and material resources should naturally be resolutely stopped.
    Of course, learning from the experience of the Soviet Union must be combined with the specific conditions of our country. For example, the high-speed cutting method of Soviet metal cutting machine tools is a very good and advanced experience, but the metal cutting machine tools in some of our enterprises are very old and have poor accuracy, but they still insist on implementing the high-speed cutting method. As a result, the machine tool speed is too fast, the temperature is too high, and the product quality does not meet the specifications, but defective products are produced instead. For example, our country has a lot of rice straw and relatively little wood. Some paper mills can and should use rice straw as raw material, but they insist on implementing the Soviet technical standard of using wood pulp as raw material, which is not right. Therefore, each industrial department and each enterprise should start from its own specific situation and decide which advanced technologies to implement and how to implement them according to the needs and possibilities of the enterprise. That is to say, the study and implementation of the advanced technical experience of the Soviet Union should be carried out with leadership, purpose, and planning, and should never be done blindly.
    Any advanced technical experience of the Soviet Union is not learned or applied as soon as it is moved over. In the process of learning or implementing it, many difficulties will often be encountered, and sometimes even failure is possible. This requires giving play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses of workers, persisting in learning and research, actively overcoming various difficulties, and finding out the most suitable specific methods for implementing this advanced technical experience.
    While attaching importance to learning the advanced technical experience of the Soviet Union and implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts, we must not neglect to summarize and implement the existing advanced experience of our country and the rationalization proposals and inventions and creations of workers. Some of our enterprises, or certain links in the enterprises, have not yet been able to learn and implement the advanced technical experience of the Soviet Union, but other enterprises or other units within the enterprise have created advanced experience, so we should summarize and promote these advanced experience with leadership and planning. On the basis of learning and mastering advanced technology, we should focus on the weak links in the enterprise, encourage the masses of workers to put forward rationalization proposals and inventions and creations according to needs and possibilities, so that production technology and working conditions can be continuously improved and enhanced. When carrying out rationalization proposals, we oppose bureaucratic behavior that suppresses rationalization proposals, and at the same time, we must also oppose the behavior of blindly putting forward "rationalization proposals" or blindly supporting "rationalization proposals" without regard to needs and possibilities. Because they are all detrimental to improving production.
    It is hoped that the workers of industrial enterprises will actively carry out labor emulation, conscientiously study the advanced technology of the Soviet Union, strive to continuously improve labor productivity, strive to comprehensively fulfill and overfulfill the national plan, and strive to realize the country's socialist industrialization at an early date.

    必须认真学习苏联的先进技术
    费平
    在我国的工业企业中，要改进和提高技术，以便进一步提高企业生产水平，这就必须：第一，学习苏联的先进技术；第二，推广我国已有的先进经验；第三，针对生产中的薄弱环节，征集合理化建议。这三者是相互联系和相辅为用，不能截然分开的，但认真学习苏联的先进技术，却是其中最重要的环节。
    为什么我们必须认真学习苏联的先进技术呢？
    以我们正在建设和将要建设的、决定我们国家命运的、以一四一项工程为骨干的工业企业来说，它们都是按照苏联最新技术标准设计的，装备着苏联的最新的机器、并在苏联专家亲自指导下进行建设和生产。我们的干部和职工，对于这些企业的技术要求都是很陌生的，如果不学习苏联的先进技术，不贯彻苏联专家的建议，不按照苏联的设计要求组织施工和组织生产，就不能把这些企业建设好；或者把工厂建成了也不能顺利地进行生产。
    以我国原有的工业企业来说，有一部分企业增加了一批苏联的新设备，进行了改造；有一部分企业的设备虽然仍是原来的，但他们担负着为一四一项新企业生产部分设备和材料的任务。这些企业的干部和职工，如果不很好地学习苏联的先进技术，按照苏联的技术标准进行生产，结果或者是不能使新的设备发挥作用，或者是它们为新企业生产的产品，在品种、规格、质量标准方面，都不能符合苏联设计的要求，无法完成供应一四一项新企业以部分的设备和材料的任务。在其他许多现有企业中，目前技术水平还很低，技术管理工作落后，产品品种任务常常完成得很不好，产品的质量没有保证，劳动生产率不能继续提高，总之，常常不能均衡地全面地完成国家计划。这些企业如果根据自己的具体情况，认真学习和推行苏联的先进技术经验，加强技术管理工作，那是可以逐渐改变落后状况的。
    事实上，几年来我们在工业建设和工业生产上的巨大成就，也主要是由于广大职工响应了党的号召，努力学习和推行了苏联的先进技术经验、认真贯彻了苏联专家建议、积极改进了企业的技术管理后才取得的。以鞍山钢铁公司为例，在生产方面，鞍钢现在五座炼铁高炉的年产量，超过了日本占领时期九座炼铁高炉的最高年产量；现在一个较小的炼钢厂的年产量，超过了日本占领时期两个炼钢厂的最高年产量；劳动生产率显著提高了，钢的成本大大降低了；质量也显著提高了，人们再也不叫
  “豆腐渣钢”和“千层钢”了。这些成绩，主要都是职工学习了苏联的先进技术，并在苏联专家的帮助下，进行了一系列的技术改革的结果。在基本建设方面，大家知道，由于职工认真学习和推行了苏联的先进技术经验，贯彻了苏联专家的建议，技术很复杂的，最新式的大型轧钢厂和无缝钢管厂，现代化的三座炼铁高炉和第二薄板厂，都迅速建设成功并顺利投入生产了。以前在国内不能生产的若干高质量产品，如重钢轨和鱼尾板，三十号槽钢和其他许多大小型钢、各种无缝钢管、若干薄钢板等等，现在鞍钢都能正式生产，并大量供应国家建设的需要。
    我们必须认真学习苏联的先进技术，这本来是很容易明白的道理。可是，我们有些同志还没有很好认识到这一点。沈阳风动工具厂的负责同志们在工作检查中说，他们曾经认为按照旧风动工具厂的老办法就可以进行生产，把苏联编制的“技术设计资料”锁在保险柜里，不组织干部和职工学习。工厂组织工人学习苏联机床说明书时，全厂只有二十几个人报名参加，绝大部分工人都不愿意参加，认为“单凭自己的经验，不学也能干活”。而另外，有些工人，则是在埋头研究，打算要“发明创造”点什么东西。有些技术人员也在整天琢磨着要创造
  “中国式铆钉机”或“沈阳式铆钉机”，并且要设计该厂生产中不需要的“多孔钻”。由于没有很好地学习和掌握新技术，他们到车间里工作以后，事故不断发生，工作效率很低，有的机器甚至被弄坏了。沈阳风动工具厂接受了这个教训，现在已在全面学习苏联的先进技术了。沈阳风动工具工厂某些干部和工人的错误，绝不是偶然的和个别的。直至目前，还有这样的一些人，他们既不学习苏联的先进技术，也看不起我国已有的先进经验，而是一心只想自己发明创造，有的人正在“发明”已经有了的设备和工具，有的人正在“创造”早已行之有效了的先进经验，甚至有人要“发明创造”既不需要也不可能的例如“自动走路机”之类的怪物。这种浪费时间和人力物力的盲目行动，自然是应该坚决加以制止的。
    当然，学习苏联的经验，必须结合我国的具体情况。例如苏联金属切削机床的高速切削法，本来是很好的先进经验，但我们有些企业的金属切削机床很旧，精密度很差，也硬要推行高速切削法，结果，机床转速太快，温度太高，产品质量不合规格，却反而出了废品。又如我国稻草很多，木材较少，有的造纸厂完全可以和应该用稻草做原料，却硬要推行苏联用木浆做原料的技术标准，这就不对了。因此，每个工业部门和每个企业，应该从本身的具体情况出发，根据企业的需要和可能，来决定推行那些先进技术和怎样推行它。这就是说，学习和推行苏联的先进技术经验，应该有领导、有目的、有计划地进行，绝不能盲目从事。
    苏联的任何一件先进技术经验，也并不是一学就会或者搬来就可以运用的。在学习或推行时往往会遇到许多困难，有时甚至可能失败。这就需要发挥职工群众的积极性和创造性，坚持学习和研究，积极克服各种困难，找出推行这种先进技术经验最适宜的具体办法来。
    重视学习苏联的先进技术经验和贯彻苏联专家的建议，也不能忽视总结和推行我国已有的先进经验以及职工的合理化建议和发明创造。我们有一部分企业，或企业中的某些环节，还没有可能学习和推行苏联的先进技术经验，但国内其他企业或企业内其他单位已创造了先进经验，我们就应该总结和有领导有计划地推广这些先进经验。在学习和掌握了先进技术的基础上，应该针对企业中的薄弱环节，根据需要和可能，鼓励职工群众提合理化建议和发明创造，使生产技术和劳动条件等不断地得到改进和提高。在开展合理化建议时，我们既反对压制合理化建议的官僚主义行为；同时也要反对不根据需要和可能，盲目乱提“合理化建议”或盲目支持“合理化建议”的行为。因为它们都是不利于提高生产的。
    希望工业企业的职工们，积极开展劳动竞赛，认真学习苏联的先进技术，为不断地提高劳动生产率，为争取全面完成和超额完成国家计划，争取早日实现国家的社会主义工业化而奋斗。
