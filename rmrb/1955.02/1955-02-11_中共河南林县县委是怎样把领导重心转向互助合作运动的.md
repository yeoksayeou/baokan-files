Since the winter of 1951, the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Lin County, Henan Province, has developed rapidly. By the autumn of last year, the county already had 1,167 agricultural production cooperatives and was moving towards a stage of great development. Lin County's ability to achieve such great results is inseparable from the Lin County Party Committee's conscientious implementation of the Central Committee's instruction to "have the secretaries take the lead and the whole Party run the cooperatives."

In the early stages of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, many leading cadres in Lin County were unfamiliar with this work. Of the thirteen county committee members, only three were familiar with the work of agricultural production cooperatives, and only twenty-seven of the one hundred and three district committee members had the professional knowledge to run cooperatives; however, many comrades were not making efforts to learn the relevant policies and professional knowledge. For example, some comrades said that mutual aid and cooperation was a long-term matter, so they would learn it slowly! Others clearly knew that there were problems within some agricultural production cooperatives that needed to be resolved, which would have been a good opportunity to learn how to run cooperatives; but they adopted a different attitude, avoiding these agricultural production cooperatives. Guo Shucheng, the former organization minister of the First District Party Committee of Lin County, once went to Qushan Village to inspect the spring plowing work. When he arrived in Qushan, he discovered that there were problems within the Qushan Agricultural Production Cooperative. He did not dare to stay long and turned to Sangyuan Village. At that time, the Sangyuan Agricultural Production Cooperative was studying how to consolidate the work of the cooperative, so he rode his bicycle to Wangxiaoao Village. As soon as he entered the village, he heard people arguing in the Wangxiaoao Agricultural Production Cooperative. He did not dare to stay long either, and finally ran to Zhaigen Village, where there was no agricultural production cooperative. Although this kind of thing was isolated, it represented the emotions of some cadres at that time who were unwilling and afraid to lead agricultural production cooperatives. The leading comrades of the Lin County Committee, including County Party Secretary Yang Gui, were equally ignorant and uncaring about the work of agricultural production cooperatives. Once, when the secretary of the Anyang Prefectural Committee talked to him about agricultural production, he asked him a question: "Why are the agricultural production cooperatives in Lin County all 'fixed-rent systems'? What opinions do the masses have on this issue?" Comrade Yang Gui was unable to answer. When Yang Gui returned to the county, he asked the head of the County Committee's Rural Work Department to answer, but the head of the Rural Work Department was also unable to answer. This incident made Comrade Yang Gui realize that it was problematic not to lead and study agricultural collectivization.

Despite these problems in the leadership of Lin County, the agricultural production cooperatives that had been established were increasing production year by year. The yield of wheat in some cooperatives reached more than 500 jin per mu. Driven by the cooperatives, more than 1,600 mutual aid teams in the county requested to become cooperatives last July. These facts made the county leadership deeply realize that if they did not shift the focus of their leadership, they would not be able to adapt to the new situation of the agricultural collectivization movement. At this time, the higher authorities transmitted the guideline of "Secretaries Take the Lead and the Whole Party Runs the Cooperatives" put forward by the Third Rural Work Conference convened by the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. Comrade Yang Gui then put forward the opinion of implementing the guideline of the whole Party running the cooperatives at the County Committee meeting. At that time, some people expressed their approval, while others expressed their doubts. They said: Currently, there are very few agricultural production cooperatives in the county. If we shift the focus of leadership to the mutual aid and cooperation movement, what about other work? It is not yet time to rely on the mutual aid and cooperation movement to carry out other work. Still others felt that the business of agricultural production cooperatives was complex and they could not lead it for the time being. In response to this thinking, the Lin County Party Committee convened several County Committee meetings to criticize it. At the meeting, Comrade Yang Gui listed the example of promoting the "single-plant close planting method" for millet to educate everyone; in 1953, because it was not done through agricultural production cooperatives, the leadership shouted themselves hoarse, but the masses would not do it. In 1954, the task was completed very quickly through the demonstration of agricultural production cooperatives. This shows that as long as the leadership is good at grasping the link of mutual aid and cooperation, it can drive all rural work forward. In order to further clarify the Central Committee's guidelines and policies for developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the Lin County Party Committee also mobilized all County Committee members to study the Central Committee's documents on mutual aid and cooperation work. Then, a joint meeting of district committee secretaries and township branch secretaries was convened to convey the County Committee's decision, summarize the achievements and experiences of the mutual aid and cooperation movement in Lin County over the past two years, and put forward the slogan: "Work hard to learn, and transform from being an outsider to an insider in running cooperatives," demanding that the whole Party take active action. After the meeting, combined with conveying the spirit of the meeting, a study movement was launched throughout the county with the township as the unit, and most Party members participated. Through this meeting, the policy and ideological level and the enthusiasm for running cooperatives of all Party members in Lin County were improved, creating good conditions for further implementing "the whole Party runs the cooperatives."

After the guideline of "the whole Party runs the cooperatives" began to ferment among cadres and the masses, the County Committee, according to the instructions of the higher authorities and the degree of awareness of the local masses, decided to build 950 new agricultural production cooperatives throughout the county. This was a completely new and arduous task for cadres at all levels in Lin County. The Lin County Party Committee believed that the County Committee's leadership should not only carry out general ideological leadership work, but also go deep into the countryside to conduct typical demonstrations.

In the process of building 950 new cooperatives, the Lin County Party Committee started from the following aspects:

First, conduct in-depth investigation and research to correct the "leftist" and rightist emotions of cadres towards the mutual aid and cooperation movement. At that time, two emotions generally existed among county and district cadres: One was to overestimate the consciousness of the peasant masses, thinking that "collectivization" was an easy task. The Fourth District of Lin County attempted to establish several collectivized townships in the entire district at once. The other was to underestimate the level of awareness of the masses, saying that the masses' voluntary participation in the cooperative was fake, and even wanted to gradually reduce the size of the agricultural production cooperatives that had already been developed and mobilize members to withdraw from the cooperatives. In order to correct this erroneous view, County Party Secretary Yang Gui organized a work team to conduct a specific investigation in Qianjiazhuang, Baiyangao, First District of Lin County. They convened representatives from all strata for discussions and conducted field visits and family surveys. From the materials obtained from the investigation, they divided the thinking of the masses into four types: The first type truly belonged to those with high socialist consciousness who actively demanded to participate in agricultural production cooperatives; the second type would follow suit and join the agricultural production cooperatives after seeing others participating; the third type did not fully understand agricultural production cooperatives and still had some ideological concerns; the fourth type had resistant emotions towards the mutual aid and cooperation movement. According to these four different types, Comrade Yang Gui lined up the peasants in the entire village household by household and found that the first and fourth types were in the minority, and the second and third types were in the majority. That is to say, in the early stages of the large-scale development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the Party must fully estimate the socialist consciousness of the peasants on the one hand, and on the other hand, it must do a good job of political and ideological education and patiently carry out education. The County Committee's style of personally conducting in-depth investigation and research not only clarified the erroneous ideological understanding of cadres, but also set an example for district and township cadres and rural Party members in terms of work methods. Subsequently, the Fourth District of Lin County also followed the County Committee's approach and conducted a detailed investigation, thereby formulating a practical and feasible plan for developing agricultural production cooperatives.

Second, train a large number of backbone members for running cooperatives to improve the ability of county, district, and township cadres to lead the mutual aid and cooperation movement. In the early stages of the large-scale development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the Lin County Party Committee, based on the Central Committee's guidelines and policies for building cooperatives, combined with the actual situation of running cooperatives in the county over the past three years, compiled some small pamphlets and distributed them to cadres as learning materials. In addition, it also trained more than 600 township branch secretaries, township heads, members of district committees, and general district-level cadres throughout the county. During the training process, the County Committee's leadership especially emphasized that cadres should learn from veteran cooperative directors and criticized those cadres who were unwilling to humbly ask veteran cooperative directors for advice. Experience has proved that this learning method is very effective. Most cadres have improved their professional skills through learning, and some township cadres have been able to independently carry out cooperative work. The leadership level of the district committees has also been significantly improved. According to incomplete statistics, 97 of the 103 district committee members in the county are now able to grasp the work of building cooperatives.

Third, use the mutual aid and cooperation station (that is, the mutual aid and cooperation network) organization to exchange advanced experiences in building cooperatives and agricultural production. In order to promptly promote advanced experiences throughout the county, the Lin County Party Committee established 75 mutual aid and cooperation stations during the process of building cooperatives. These stations were distributed in various districts, and each station supervised a number of agricultural production cooperatives, one of which was a key cooperative. The station was headed by a station chief, mostly concurrently held by members of the district committee. In addition, each district also established a general station, which was headed by the district committee secretary. District and township cadres could exchange advanced experiences in running cooperatives at the station's meeting, and any difficulties in work could also be raised at the meeting for research and resolution. For example, during the evaluation of production, the Anjiayu Village Agricultural Production Cooperative in the Seventh District evaluated production based solely on the size of the harvest, regardless of the quality of the soil, which aroused dissatisfaction among the members. After this issue was raised at the mutual aid and cooperation station, everyone conducted research and invited advanced cooperatives to introduce their experiences in this regard, and as a result, they found the correct method of evaluating production. Li Yunbao, the secretary of the First District Committee, created the experience of improving the soil in the Longdejiang Agricultural Production Cooperative, which was also widely promoted through the mutual aid and cooperation station.

Fourth, after the mutual aid and cooperation movement achieved certain results throughout the county, the County Committee paid attention to guiding how the business work of various departments should cooperate with the mutual aid and cooperation movement, such as guiding the Public Security Bureau to establish a security work system within the agricultural production cooperative to protect the collective property of the agricultural cooperative. The organization department and the propaganda department conducted collectivist ideological education for Party members in the cooperative and promoted the experience of outstanding Party members leading agricultural production cooperatives. The Communist Youth League was guided to develop the League's organization in a planned way and enhance the new force within the cooperative. The County Women's Federation summarized the experience of mobilizing women to participate in cooperatives. Through these efforts, the mutual aid and cooperation movement was put on a normal track.

    中共河南林县县委是怎样把领导重心转向互助合作运动的
    李广平
    一九五一年冬季以来，河南林县的互助合作运动发展的较快，去年秋前全县已有一千一百六十七个农业生产合作社，并正在走向大发展的阶段。林县所以能取得这样大的成绩，是和中共林县县委认真执行了中央关于“书记动手全党办社”的指示分不开的。
    在互助合作运动的初期，林县许多领导干部是不熟悉这一工作的。全县十三个县委委员只有三个人熟悉农业生产合作社的工作，在一百零三个区委委员中也只有二十七个人有办社的业务知识；但是有很多同志又不努力去学习这方面的政策知识和业务知识。例如：有些同志说，互助合作是长期的事，慢慢地学吧！另有些同志明明知道有些农业生产合作社内存在着问题，需要解决，也正好从解决这些问题中学习办社知识；但他们却采取了另一种态度，躲避这些农业生产社。中共林县一区前任区委组织部长郭暑成有一次到曲山村检查春耕工作，他一到曲山发现曲山农业生产合作社内有问题，他不敢多住，扭头就去到桑园村；当时桑园农业生产合作社正在研究如何巩固社的工作，他就骑上自行车又跑到王小凹；刚一进村，就听到王小凹农业生产合作社里有人正在吵架；他又没有敢久停，最后跑到一个没有农业生产合作社的寨根村去了。这种事情虽然是个别的，但他却代表了当时一部分干部不愿和不敢领导农业生产合作社的情绪。林县县委会的领导同志，包括县委书记杨贵在内，对农业生产合作社的工作同样是既不懂也不管。一次安阳地委书记和他谈到农业生产时，向他提出一个问题：“为什么林县的农业生产合作社都是‘死租制’？群众对这个问题有什么意见？”杨贵同志无法对答。杨贵回到县里后，要县委农村工作部长解答，农村工作部长同样答不出来。这件事已使杨贵同志感到不领导不研究农业合作化是有问题的了。
    尽管林县领导上存在着这些问题，但是已经建立起来的农业生产合作社却逐年在提高产量。有的合作社小麦的产量每亩达到五百多斤。在合作社的带动下，去年七月全县就有一千六百多个互助组要求转社。这些事实使县的领导上深深感到再不转变领导重心，就不能适应农业合作化运动的新形势了。这时，恰好上级传达了中共中央农村工作部召开的第三次农村工作会议提出的“书记动手全党办社”的方针。杨贵同志便在县委会上提出了贯彻全党办社方针的意见，当时，有些人表示赞同，也有些人表示怀疑，他们说：目前县里的农业生产合作社还很少，把领导重心转向互助合作运动，其他的工作怎么办？依靠互助合作运动开展其他工作目前还不到时候。还有些人仍感到农业生产合作社业务复杂，一时领导不起来。针对这种思想，中共林县县委会召开了数次县委会议进行批判。会上杨贵同志列举了推广谷子“单株密留法”事例来教育大家；一九五三年因为没有通过农业生产合作社，领导喊破了嗓门，群众不干，一九五四年通过了农业生产合作社的示范，很迅速地完成了任务。这说明：只要领导善于掌握互助合作这一环节，就可以把农村各项工作带动起来。为了进一步明确中央的发展互助合作运动的方针政策，林县县委会又发动全体县委委员学习了中央有关互助合作工作的文件。接着召开了全县区委书记和乡支部书记的联席会议，传达了县委的决定，并总结了林县两年来互助合作运动的成绩和经验，提出了：“努力学习，由办社外行转成办社内行”的口号，要求全党积极行动起来。会议结束后，结合传达会议精神，全县以乡为单位展开了学习运动，大部分党员都参加了。通过这次会议，提高了林县全体党员的政策思想水平和办社的积极性，为进一步贯彻“全党办社”创造了良好的条件。
    “全党办社”的方针开始在干部群众中酝酿后，县委根据上级的指示和当地群众觉悟程度，决定在全县内新建九百五十个农业生产合作社，这对林县各级干部说来都是一次全新的艰巨的任务。林县县委认为：县委的领导上不但要作一般的思想领导工作，还须要深入农村，进行典型示范。
    在新建九百五十个新社过程中，林县县委是从如下几个方面着手的：
    第一，深入调查研究，纠正干部对互助合作运动的“左”的和右的情绪。当时，在县区干部中普遍地存在着两种情绪：一种是把农民群众的觉悟估计过高，认为“合作化”是一件轻而易举的事。林县四区企图一下子就在全区建立几个合作化乡。另一种是把群众的觉悟程度估计得过低，说什么群众的自愿入社都是假的，甚至想把已经发展起来的农业生产合作社逐步缩小，动员社员退社。为了纠正这种错误的看法，县委书记杨贵组织了工作组，深入到林县一区白杨凹钱家庄进行具体调查。他们召集各阶层的代表举行了座谈，进行了田间访问和家庭调查，从调查得来的材料，他们将群众的思想分成了四种类型：第一种是真正属于社会主义觉悟高、积极要求参加农业生产合作社的；第二种是看到别人参加农业生产合作社后，自己也会跟着入社的；第三种是对农业生产合作社还不完全了解，还有些思想顾虑；第四种是对互助合作运动有抵触情绪的。杨贵同志根据这四种不同的类型，将全村农民逐户地排了队，发现属于第一种和第四种的人是少数，第二、三种类型是多数。这就是说：在互助合作运动大发展初期，党对农民一方面要充分估计到他们的社会主义觉悟，另外一方面，还须要做好政治思想教育工作，耐心地进行教育。县委亲自深入调查研究的作风，不但澄清了干部中的错误思想认识，同时在工作方法上，也给区乡干部和农村党员做出了榜样。接着林县四区也按照县委的做法，作了详细的调查，从而订出了一个切实可行的发展农业生产合作社的计划。
    第二，训练大批办社骨干，提高县、区、乡干部领导互助合作运动的能力。在互助合作运动大发展初期，林县县委根据中央的建社方针和政策，结合本县三年来办社实际情况，编写了一些小册子，印发给干部作为学习材料。此外还训练了全县乡支部书记、乡长、各区委委员和一般区级干部六百多人。在训练过程中，县委领导上特别强调干部要向老社长学习，对那种不愿向老社长虚心请教的干部，进行了批评。经验证明：这种学习方法效果很好，大部分干部通过学习，提高了业务能力，有一部分乡干部已能够单独进行办社工作。区委的领导水平也有了显著的提高，根据不完全的统计，全县一百零三个区委委员中现在已有九十七个委员能够掌握建社的工作。
    第三，运用互助合作站（就是互助合作网）组织，交流建社和农业生产中的先进经验。为了在全县范围内及时推广先进经验，林县县委曾在建社过程中建立了七十五个互助合作站。这些站分布在各个区，每个站管辖若干农业生产合作社，其中有一个是重点社，站设站长，大部是区委委员兼任，此外每一个区还设总站，由区委书记负责。区、乡干部在办社中有那些先进的经验，可以在站的碰头会上交流，工作上有些什么困难也可以在会上提出研究解决。譬如在评产工作时，七区安家峪村农业生产合作社不根据土质好坏，单凭收成大小进行评产，结果引起社员的不满。这个问题提到互助合作站以后，大家进行了研究，并请先进社介绍了这方面的经验，结果找到了评产的正确方法。一区区委书记李运保在龙得江农业生产合作社创造了改良土壤的经验，通过互助合作站也得到普遍推广。
    第四，当互助合作运动在全县范围内取得一定成绩后，县委注意领导各部门的业务工作如何与互助合作运动相配合，如领导公安局在农业生产合作社内建立保卫工作制度，保卫农业社的集体财产。组织部门和宣传部门向社内党员进行集体主义思想教育，推广优秀党员领导农业生产合作社的经验。领导青年团有计划地发展团的组织、增强社内的新生力量。县民主妇女联合会总结发动妇女参加合作社的经验。经过这些工作，把互助合作运动引上了正常的轨道。
