How We Lead Junior Group Full-Time Theory Teachers in Lesson Preparation
The Propaganda Department of the Kunming Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China

Kunming City has a total of thirteen full-time theory teachers at the primary level, all of whom studied at the "Economic Construction Common Knowledge Teacher Training Class" run by the Provincial Party Committee the year before last. When they first arrived at their posts in October 1953, they lacked confidence in lecturing on the "Economic Construction Common Knowledge Reader." At that time, both teachers and students had ideological concerns. From the students' point of view, they didn't trust the new teachers and were afraid they wouldn't teach well. For example, some students said, "The new teacher is about the same as me in the past, and now he's teaching me after only a few months of study," and some were unconvinced. From the teachers' point of view, they felt that they lacked both book knowledge and production knowledge, and they were afraid of "easy to get on stage, difficult to get off" and "making a fool of themselves in public" when lecturing in front of one or two thousand students. In response to the above situation, we solved it from two aspects: on the one hand, we held a meeting of representatives of primary group students, pointing out that we should proceed from reality and not demand too much from the teachers, thereby fundamentally correcting the learning attitude; on the other hand, we required the teachers to prepare carefully and established a collective lesson preparation system, which could both give play to the collective strength of the teachers and facilitate specific leadership over the teachers.

We believe that the requirements for collective lesson preparation, in addition to first strengthening the teachers' confidence in doing a good job, are more importantly to ensure that the teachers' lectures are correct and error-free. Therefore, we put forward the purpose of collective lesson preparation: to draw on collective wisdom, avoid mistakes, gradually improve teaching quality, and correctly implement the Central Committee's instructions of "serious preparation, correct explanation, and cautious attitude." In terms of specific practices, we divide it into the following four steps:

First Step: Teachers should read the textbook content carefully, study it repeatedly, and clarify the spirit and essence of the textbook. This is the first step in writing the lecture notes.

Second Step: The Propaganda Department convenes a teachers' symposium to discuss the teaching plan formulated by the Propaganda Department, study the key issues to be resolved in each chapter and section, and then the teachers focus on the key points and purposefully read reference materials to prepare for writing the lecture notes.

Third Step: Writing and discussing lecture notes. After the teachers write the lecture notes, they are sent to the Propaganda Department for review, and a few of the better lecture notes are circulated among the teachers, and one of them is selected as the basis for discussion, revision and supplementation to unify the main spirit of the lecture notes. Then, according to the different situations of government offices, factories, and rural areas, specific content is added.

Fourth Step: Trial lecture. After the lecture notes are discussed and revised, the Propaganda Department assigns one person to give a trial lecture (usually whoever's lecture notes are used gives the trial lecture), and invites class teachers and counselors from various branch schools to listen to the trial lecture, and organizes discussions, puts forward opinions, and develops criticism. As a result of our doing this, we have basically achieved the requirements of a cautious attitude and correct explanation. The students' feedback is: the teachers are well prepared, familiar with the textbook, and the lectures are relatively clear, making it easier for the students to understand, but the connection with reality is poor.

When studying the Party's general line during the transition period, the Municipal Party Committee directly led the collective lesson preparation of municipal-level reporters. In order to further improve the full-time teachers, the Propaganda Department organized the primary group full-time teachers to participate in the lesson preparation work of each chapter of the general line, serving as assistants and "apprentices" to the municipal-level reporters, collecting reference materials, checking theoretical basis, reflecting the ideological situation of the students, and some even giving remedial lessons or tutorials to the students. When studying the draft constitution, the Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee also absorbed primary full-time teachers to participate in the "Draft Constitution Propagandist Training Class." Through these studies, the teachers' ideological and policy level has been greatly improved, thereby clarifying that national industrialization is to lay a material foundation for socialism, and theoretical work is to lay an ideological foundation for socialism, clarifying that lectures must be in contact with reality to solve the students' ideological problems, and enhancing the teachers' enthusiasm for theoretical education and the spirit of hard study. At the same time, through the study of the general line, the students' ideological level has also been improved, and their requirements for teachers can no longer be satisfied with only the organization of the textbook and theoretical citations, but require further contact with reality, contact with the ideological situation of cadres and the masses in the implementation of the Party's policies, and theoretical elaboration. In order to enrich the teachers' perceptual knowledge of economic construction and improve the quality of teaching, when preparing lessons for Chapters 4 and 5 of the "Economic Construction Common Knowledge Reader," some full-time cadres from municipal-level government offices and factories and mines were invited to introduce the production and management situation of factories and mines to the primary group teachers. Therefore, it is generally possible to initially achieve the integration of theory with practice. For example, when lecturing on Chapters 4 and 5 of the "Economic Construction Common Knowledge Reader," some criticisms were made of the erroneous thoughts of decentralism and conservatism encountered in the implementation of the socialist management principles in factories and mining enterprises. For example, when studying the constitution, some cadres of the Municipal Department Store one-sidedly emphasized that the constitution stipulates that citizens have the right to rest, so that when the company's warehouse was flooded and the leadership mobilized everyone to work overtime to rescue materials, some cadres were unwilling to move, saying that it violated their "right to rest." When explaining the constitution, the teacher combined the section on citizens' rights and obligations to criticize this erroneous idea of not cherishing state property. The students reflected after listening to the lecture: "This lecture solves the problem and scratches our itch."

In general, the basic situation in the past year is: through collective lesson preparation, the quality of teaching has gradually improved. Teachers have gone from being afraid of lecturing to daring to lecture, from not knowing how to connect with reality to clarifying that it is necessary to connect with reality, and have begun to explore how to connect with reality. With the gradual improvement of the quality of teachers' lectures, the students' inappropriate views on teachers have also changed. At present, many students have reflected that these teachers' lectures are helpful to their learning.

We have the following points of understanding about collective lesson preparation:

(1) Seriously implementing the Party Central Committee's instructions on lecturing must be "seriously prepared, correctly explained, and cautiously attitude" is a guarantee to avoid errors in lecturing. The Municipal Party Committee Propaganda Department attaches great importance to this. At the beginning of collective lesson preparation, on the one hand, teachers were encouraged to work hard to prepare lessons and boldly get on stage; but at the same time, it was pointed out that it is necessary to prevent the phenomenon of "speaking off the cuff" and "pandering to the public" in order to make the lectures lively. Therefore, it is required that not only should an outline be written in the preparation of lessons, but also detailed lecture notes; citations must be based on evidence and should not be taken out of context; examples should maintain seriousness, authenticity, and attention to timeliness; numbers should be repeatedly checked to be accurate. The result of doing this is that more labor will have more effect and improve the quality of the lecture. In the preparation of lessons, it is necessary to study seriously and be familiar with the content in order to explain it correctly and avoid the phenomenon of unclear explanations due to "half-baked" preparation and temporary digressions. But to achieve serious preparation and hard study, it is first necessary to have a high degree of political responsibility.

(2) Clear center, prominent key points, and clear organization have a decisive effect on the effectiveness of lectures. When preparing lessons, it is first necessary to consider the purpose and requirements of each lecture, and to study and consider in detail what is the central content of each chapter and section, and what problems must be explained in order to make the center prominent. In our collective lesson preparation, our understanding of the question of "how to highlight the center" is: when lecturing, it is necessary to focus on the center of the textbook and explain the problems to be solved. When solving each problem, it is necessary to bury a "foreshadowing" for the central problem, rather than solving this problem in isolation. In this way, there is no need to explain the central problem at length in the end, and the central problem can be explained simply by emphasizing it and connecting it before and after. In this way, everything revolves around the center, and the center explains everything.

(3) Inspiring students to use their brains, study hard, and study diligently is the fundamental method to cultivate learning interest, guide learning, and improve learning quality. In the case where the habit of learning has not yet been formed, students' attitude towards learning is mostly "you teach me to learn" and "you lecture and I listen." When encountering difficult problems in learning, they rarely use their brains to consider, or even think about it before asking questions. Some regard the teacher as a "living dictionary" and "encyclopedia" that answers every question. As a result, in order to be busy solving problems, teachers and counselors are exhausted and very passive, and some counselors are even afraid to go to the group because of this, and the benefit to the students is not great. On the contrary, it promotes lazy thinking. At the same time, if problems are answered by solving problems, students often develop the bad habit of not studying and comprehending the spirit and essence of the documents, but only reciting conclusions, answers, or taking passages out of context and memorizing articles by rote. In this way, not only can the problem not be solved fundamentally, but also many problems of the same type are often explained here, but cannot be solved in another place. The occurrence of this situation is mainly due to the inability to grasp the essence of the problem to give an answer. Therefore, for the problems raised by the students, it is necessary to first study their essence, and then use the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism to help them analyze the problem, guide them to solve the problem, so as to play the effect of "drawing inferences about other cases from one instance." That is to say, the "key" must be handed over to them, and they must be taught how to open the "lock," rather than opening the "lock" for them.

From the above situation, collective lesson preparation has achieved certain gains, but there are also many shortcomings. In order to consolidate and improve collective lesson preparation on the existing basis, it is necessary to focus on solving the following problems:

(1) Seriously implement the policy of linking theory with practice. Linking theory with practice is the fundamental method of studying Marxism-Leninism, and seriously mastering this method plays a decisive role in improving the effect of theoretical education. Although we have begun to pay attention to this issue in the past period, we have not done enough in our work. The main manifestation is that we have not studied the Party's policies, the central work of the Municipal Party Committee, and the ideological situation of cadres deeply and thoroughly. In future lesson preparation, we should especially emphasize linking with reality, seriously study the Party's policies and study the central work of the Municipal Party Committee; conduct in-depth investigations and analysis of the current ideological situation of cadres, timely and correctly interpret the Party's policies; timely and correctly explain many new and urgent problems in the lives of the masses; criticize all thoughts that violate the Party's general line and the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session, as well as the erroneous tendencies in implementing the Party's policies and the central work of the Municipal Party Committee, in order to improve the ideological and combat effectiveness of teaching work.

(2) Continuously improve the ideological and professional level of theory teachers. To enable theory teachers to undertake the task of educating the masses with Marxist-Leninist thought, it is necessary to make the teachers themselves have a high level of theoretical thought. Therefore, improving the political and ideological level of teachers is very important. In the past, we also did a poor job in this area, so that some teachers themselves were not at a high level, and some were even uneasy in their work. Therefore, in the future, in addition to strengthening education and supervision of teachers through the Party organizations in the units where the teachers are located, it is also necessary to seriously organize the teachers' own political and theoretical study, and require the teachers to first link with their own thoughts and work reality to criticize and correct erroneous ideological styles. In addition, attention should also be paid to gradually improving the teachers' professional level. In the past, we only paid attention to preparation before class and collecting feedback after class, but lacked summarization of teaching experience, and even if we studied it, it was very messy, without a plan or steps, and we talked about whatever problems we encountered. In the future, the feedback from the masses should be studied in a planned way; at the same time, they should be organized to study the teaching experience of other places, and guide teachers to summarize their own experience and exchange with each other to improve the quality of teaching.

(3) Cultivate a reserve force of theory teachers. At present, our theory teachers are not only of low quality, but also insufficient in quantity. Some teachers take courses in four to ten units, and each lecture has to be given three or four times, with more than a thousand people each time, which has a great impact on the quality of teaching. This situation is not compatible with the needs of the ever-developing socialist construction cause. To this end, while training and improving existing teachers, we have also developed a group of disseminators to supplement the shortage of existing teachers and serve as a new supplementary force. Experience has proved that this method can be promoted. In the future, in addition to paying attention to training and improving existing disseminators and summarizing their work experience, attention should also be paid to developing and cultivating disseminators in urban areas, suburbs, and various factories and mines, so that they can gradually become a reserve force for teaching.

    我们是怎样领导初级组专职理论教员备课的
    中共昆明市委宣传部
    昆明市一级专职理论教员共十三人，都是在前年省委所办“经济建设常识教员训练班”学习过的。一九五三年十月，他们初到工作岗位时，对讲授“经济建设常识读本”的信心不大。当时教员、学员都各有思想顾虑。从学员来说，对新教员不信任，怕教不好。如有的学员说：“新教员过去与我差不多，才学了几个月就来教我”，有些不服气。从教员来说，则是感到自己既缺乏书本知识，又缺少生产知识，要在一两千学员面前讲课，怕“上台容易下台难”，在“大庭广众之中出丑”。针对上述情况，我们从两方面来解决：一方面召开了初级组学员代表会，指出要从实际出发，对教员不能要求过高，从而基本上端正了学习态度；另一方面要求教员认真准备，并建立了集体备课制度，这样既可以发挥教员的集体力量、又便于对教员的具体领导。
    我们认为集体备课的要求，除首先加强教员搞好工作的信心外，更重要的是使教员讲课做到正确讲解，不犯错误。因此，我们提出集体备课的目的是：集思广益，避免错误，逐步提高教学质量，正确贯彻中央所指示的“认真准备，正确讲解，态度谨慎”的要求。在具体做法上，我们分为以下四个步骤进行：
    第一步：教员熟读课文内容，反复钻研，明确课文的精神实质，这是编写讲稿的首要步骤。
    第二步：由宣传部召开教员座谈会，讨论宣传部所拟订的教学计划，研究每一章、节所要解决的重点问题，然后教员围绕重点，有目的地去阅读参考资料，为编写讲稿作好准备。
    第三步：编写和讨论讲稿。教员写好讲稿后，送宣传部审查，并抽出其中较好的几份讲稿在教员中传阅，评选出其中一份作为基础，加以讨论修正和补充，使讲稿的主要精神统一。然后根据机关、工厂、农村不同情况，再去补充具体内容。
    第四步：试讲。讲稿经过讨论修正后，由宣传部指定一人试讲（一般是谁的讲稿就由谁试讲），吸收各分校的班主任、辅导员来听试讲，并组织讨论，提出意见，展开批评。我们这样做的结果，基本上达到了态度谨慎、讲解正确的要求。学员的反映是：教员准备充分，熟悉课文，讲课时条理较清楚，学员也易于听懂，只是联系实际较差。
    学习党在过渡时期总路线时，市委直接领导市级报告员集体备课，并为了使专职教员提高一步，宣传部就组织初级组专职教员分别参加总路线各章的备课工作，给市级报告员当助手、做“徒弟”，搜集参考资料，查理论根据，反映学员思想情况，有些还给学员补课或上辅导课。在学习宪法草案时，市委宣传部又吸收初级专职教员参加“宪法草案宣传员训练班”学习。通过这些学习，教员的思想政策水平有了很大的提高，从而明确了国家工业化是为社会主义打下物质基础，理论工作是为社会主义打下思想基础，明确了讲课要接触实际才能解决学员的思想问题，增强教员对理论教育工作的积极性和刻苦钻研的精神。与此同时，通过总路线的学习，学员的思想水平也有了提高，对教员的要求已不能满足于仅仅是课文的组织和理论上的引证，而是要求进一步联系实际，联系在贯彻党的方针、政策中干部和群众的思想情况，并从理论上加以阐明。为了充实教员对经济建设的感性知识，提高教学质量，在“经济建设常识读本”第四、五章备课时，请了市级机关和厂矿的一些专职干部，给初级组教员介绍厂矿的生产情况和管理情况，因此，一般能初步做到理论联系实际。如在讲授“经济建设常识读本”第四、五章时，对于社会主义经营管理原则在厂矿企业中贯彻时所碰到的分散主义、保守主义等错误思想，都作了一定的批判。又如在学习宪法时，市百货公司有些干部，片面强调宪法规定公民有休息权，以致在该公司仓库被水淹，领导上发动大家加班抢救物资时，有些干部却不愿意动，说是侵犯了他的“休息权”。教员在讲解宪法时，就结合公民的权利和义务一节，批判了这种不爱护国家财产的错误思想。学员听课后反映说：“这样讲很解决问题，抓着我们的痒处了。”
    总的说来，一年来的基本情况是：通过集体备课，教学质量逐步有了提高，教员由不敢讲课到敢讲课，由不懂得要联系实际到明确必须联系实际，并开始摸索到如何联系实际。随着教员授课质量的逐步提高，同时亦改变了学员对教员的不适当的看法。目前，很多学员都反映：这批教员讲课对自己学习有帮助了。
    我们对集体备课有下列几点认识：
    （一）认真贯彻党中央关于讲课必须“认真准备，正确讲解，态度谨慎”的指示，是使讲授避免错误的保证。市委宣传部在这方面是十分重视的。在开始集体备课时，一方面鼓励教员努力备课，大胆上台；但同时也指出要防止为了讲课生动而产生“信口开河”、“哗众取宠”的现象。因此，要求在备课中不但要写好提纲，而且要写好详细的讲稿；引证要有根据，不能断章取义；举例要保持严肃性、真实性和注意时间性；数字要反复查对确实。这样做的结果是多一分劳动，就多有一分效果，提高了讲课的质量。备课中必须认真自学，熟悉内容，才能正确讲解，不致因准备“半生不熟”，临时东拉西扯，发生讲解不清等现象。但要做到认真准备、刻苦钻研，就首先必须具有高度的政治责任感。
    （二）中心明确、重点突出、条理清楚，对讲课效果具有决定性的作用。备课时首先要从每一讲的目的要求来考虑，对每章、每节的中心内容是什么，讲些什么问题才能使中心突出等，都要详细加以研究和考虑。我们在集体备课中，对于“如何突出中心”这个问题的体会是：讲课时，要围绕课文的中心，讲解所要解决的问题。在解决每一个问题时都要为中心问题埋下“伏笔”，而不是孤立地去解决这一个问题。这样，最后在解决中心问题时就不需要长篇累牍地来讲解，只要加以强调，前后联系起来就能说明中心问题。这样就做到一切围绕中心，中心又说明了一切。
      （三）启发学员多动脑筋、苦学钻研，是培养学习兴趣、指导学习、提高学习质量的根本方法。在学习还没有养成习惯的情况下，学员对学习的态度多半是“你教我学”、“你讲我听”。在学习中碰到困难问题时，很少动脑筋考虑、甚至不动脑筋想一想就提出来发问。有的是把教员当做百问百答的“活字典”、“百科全书”。这样的结果，为了忙于解决问题，教员、辅导员弄得疲于奔命，非常被动，有的辅导员甚至因此而不敢下小组，对学员的补益也不大，相反地助长了懒汉思想。同时，若就问题解答问题，往往使学员养成不去钻研领会文件的精神实质，只背诵结论、答案或断章取义、死啃条文的恶习。如此，不仅不能从根本上解决问题，而且使得有许多同一类型的问题，也往往在这里交代了，但在另一个地方又不能解决。这种情况的产生，主要是不能抓住问题的精神实质来给以解答。因此，对学员提出的问题，必须首先研究其实质所在，然后以马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法帮助他们去分析问题，指导他们解决问题的方法，使之起到“举一反三”的效果。这就是说，要把“钥匙”交给他们，教会他们去开“锁”的方法，而不是代他们去开“锁”。
    从上述情况看来，集体备课是取得了一定收获的，但也存在着许多缺点。为了使集体备课在现有基础上巩固起来并提高一步，就要着重解决以下几个问题：
    （一）认真贯彻理论联系实际的方针。理论联系实际是学习马克思列宁主义的根本方法，认真掌握这一方法，对于提高理论教育的效果，起着决定性的作用。在过去一段时间中，我们虽然已经开始注意这一问题，但在工作中却做得非常不够。主要表现在对党的政策、市委的中心工作和干部的思想情况等研究得不深不透。在今后备课时，应特别强调联系实际，认真学习党的政策和研究市委的中心工作；深入调查和分析干部当前思想情况，及时而正确地对党的政策进行解释；及时而正确地阐明群众生活中许多新的迫切的问题；批判一切违反党的总路线和四中全会决议的思想，以及在贯彻党的政策、贯彻市中心工作时的错误倾向，以提高教学工作的思想性和战斗性。
      （二）不断提高理论教员的思想水平和业务水平。要理论教员能够担负起以马克思列宁主义思想教育群众的任务，就必须使教员自己具有较高的理论思想水平。因此提高教员的政治思想水平是非常重要的。过去我们对这一方面也做得很差，以致有的教员本身水平不高，甚至还有个别的不安心工作。因此，今后除通过教员所在单位党的组织对教员加强教育和监督外，并须认真组织教员本身的政治理论学习，要求教员首先联系自己的思想、工作实际，批判和纠正错误的思想作风。此外，对教员的业务水平，也要注意逐步提高。过去我们只注意了课前准备，课后收集反映，而对教学经验则缺乏总结，即使研究了也很凌乱，没有计划没有步骤，碰到什么问题就谈什么问题。今后对群众的反映，应有计划地进行研究；同时并应组织他们学习外地的教学经验，及指导教员总结自己的经验，互相交流，以提高教学质量。
      （三）培养理论教员的后备力量。目前我们的理论教员不唯质量不高，而且数量也很不够。有些教员担任了四个到十个单位的课程，每一讲要讲三、四次课，每次多到一千余人，这对教学质量影响很大。随着日益发展的社会主义建设事业的需要，这种情况是不相适应的。为此，与培养、提高现有教员的同时，我们又发展了一批传授员，以补现有教员力量的不足，作为新的补充力量。经验证明，这种办法是可以推行的。今后除对现有的传授员注意培养提高，总结他们的工作经验外，并注意在市区、郊区以及各厂矿中发展和培养传授员，使之逐渐成为教学的后备力量。
