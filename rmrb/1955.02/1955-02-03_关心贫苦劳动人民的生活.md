    The deeds of Jiang Xishan, the Party branch secretary of Xinting Township, Dongliu County, Anhui Province, who braved the snow, continued working despite his illness, and went deep into the disaster area to provide relief to the victims, are deeply moving. He was originally very healthy, but during the flood control struggle last year, he stayed on the river embankment all day, risking his life to rescue people. Later, he led the disaster victims to open up wasteland in the mountains, laboring under the scorching sun during the day and sleeping in the dew at night. Even when he was sick, he continued to work, and when his illness became severe, the masses sent him home. However, as soon as he felt a little better, he struggled to continue working. The district committee, in order to take care of his health, wanted him to rest and recover, and decided not to let him participate in this tense winter relief work. But when he thought of the disaster victims after the heavy snow, he could no longer lie down. He braved the snow and went deep into the disaster area. When he found the village cadres to understand the disaster situation, he was not satisfied with the reply, "Don't worry, there are no major problems here." Instead, he went door-to-door to conduct specific inspections and solve the difficulties of the disaster victims. After a day of intense work, he set off again overnight to continue working. Although the road was very difficult, with falls, getting stuck in snow pits, and crawling on ice, these difficulties did not diminish his enthusiasm for helping the disaster victims. A day and a night of severe cold and fatigue made him feverish and shivering in bed for a day. But on the third day, as soon as he felt a little better, he continued to persevere in his work. His family has seven members and their life is also very difficult, but in order to solve the difficulties of the disaster victims, he allocated the relief money the masses gave him to others. Comrade Jiang Xishan's noble qualities fully embody the great spirit of our Party serving the laboring people wholeheartedly.
    Our Party constantly educates every Party member that they should love the laboring people, care about the lives and sufferings of the masses, try every means to help the poor laboring people get rid of poverty, and guide the broad masses of peasants onto the bright road of socialism. There are many, many excellent Communist Party members like Comrade Jiang Xishan in our Party. Even on the production and disaster relief frontlines of Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi and other provinces fighting against heavy snow and severe cold, there are tens of thousands of such Party members. Whether they are helping disaster victims repair shacks, or helping disaster victims transfer from unstable shacks; whether they are delivering large quantities of supplies to various villages on a rotating basis, or organizing the masses to clear snow from highways to ensure the smooth transport of supplies into the disaster areas; whether they are promptly distributing winter clothes, quilts, and relief funds to the most difficult disaster victims, or organizing people in non-disaster areas to sell large quantities of firewood to help the disaster victims; they all fully demonstrate the spirit and courage that a communist should possess.
    The Communist Party and the People's Government have always rescued people affected by disasters with great enthusiasm and a resolute and swift fighting style, such as using airplanes to airdrop food to rescue herdsmen affected by snow disasters, using warships to rush food and dike repair materials to flood-stricken areas, and using artillery to bombard the Yellow River ice floes that are about to cause disasters. A large number of relief supplies, including grain, firewood, charcoal, clothing, cattle fodder, vegetables, medicines, etc., are also delivered directly to the disaster victims as quickly as possible. As Zhang Huaijin, a disaster victim from Shamaozui Township, Eighth District, Mianyang County, Hubei Province, said when he saw the district committee secretary and others braving the snow to deliver rice and cotton clothes: "The Communist Party and the People's Government value people so much! They can't wait to feed the food into the mouths of those who haven't eaten. It's too good, too good!" The noble qualities of Comrade Jiang Xishan and others are also a concrete manifestation of the lofty spirit of our communists.
    Our Party is the political party of the working class. It not only wants to overthrow the social system of exploitation where people create disasters and suffering, but also, after this revolution is successful, when our economic construction is advancing by leaps and bounds and the lives of the broad masses of people are constantly improving, we must also gradually eliminate the remnants of the exploiting system that create disasters, we must also vigorously heal the wounds left to the people by the old society for thousands of years, we must also lead the broad masses of peasants onto the road of collectivization and prosperity to get rid of poverty forever, and we must also rescue the people who have suffered various disasters at any time. We are the political party of the working class, and all our work must have a clear class stand. We should always care about the poor laboring people and enthusiastically help them; the more difficult the people are, the more Party members and cadres should be with the masses, and be willing to sacrifice everything for their interests, as Comrade Jiang Xishan has shown.
    Among our Party members and cadres, there are also some who lack this spirit of loving the laboring people and caring about their lives and sufferings. They are very irresponsible in dealing with disaster relief work; some not only do not sympathize with and help the poor disaster victims, but also feel disgusted, and even attack and slander the disaster victims; some do not distribute relief grain and clothing to the poor disaster victims in a timely manner, but instead distribute them to landlords and rich peasants; some even defraud and embezzle disaster relief materials from the disaster victims, completely degenerating into heartless and soulless beasts. In the agricultural cooperativization movement, there are also Party members and cadres who lack a class stand. They despise the poor and love the rich, and refuse to allow poor peasants to participate in agricultural production cooperatives; or distort the Party's policies and cause the poor peasants to suffer losses everywhere in the agricultural production cooperatives, carrying out disguised exploitation of the poor peasants. In other rural work, there are also phenomena of being indifferent to the poor peasants, even bullying and attacking them.
    This all shows that local Party organizations still lack regular class education for these Party members and cadres. As a result, after the victory of the revolution, because their own lives have improved, they slowly forgot their roots and forgot the poor laboring people, and their class stand gradually became blurred. Some Party members and cadres even mistakenly believe that some landlords and rich peasants are "obedient," "have few opinions, have few problems, and are easy to lead"; on the contrary, they feel that poor peasants are "annoying," "have many opinions, have many problems, and are difficult to lead." Just look at how dangerous this kind of thought and behavior that is close to landlords and rich peasants and alienated from the poor laboring people without a class stand is!
    Party organizations in various places should strengthen class education for Party members. They should be good at using outstanding deeds like those of Comrade Jiang Xishan and examples of lacking or losing a class stand, comparing them to conduct class education for the broad masses of Party members; regularize this class education; and pay attention to improving Party members' class consciousness and training their class stand when publicizing, educating, and implementing the Party's various policies, and in the process of carrying out various practical tasks, so that every Party member becomes an outstanding advanced fighter of the working class with a clear class stand.

### 关心贫苦劳动人民的生活

    关心贫苦劳动人民的生活
    安徽省东流县新庭乡党支部书记江西山同志冒着雪、带着病、深入灾区救济灾民的事迹，使人十分感动。他的身体原来很健康，在去年防汛斗争中，成天坚持在江堤上，奋不顾身地抢险救人，后来他又带领灾民上山开荒，白天在火热的太阳底下劳动，夜晚在露水地里住宿，病了还继续工作，病重了群众送他回家，但是病稍好又撑着坚持工作。区委为了照顾他的身体要他安心养病，曾决定不让他参加这次紧张的冬季救灾工作，但是当他想到了大雪后的灾民，再也躺不下去。他冒雪深入灾区，当他找到村干部了解灾情的时候，他并不满足于“你放心，我们这里没大问题”的答复，而是挨家挨户地去作具体检查和具体解决灾民的困难。紧张地工作一天以后，他又连夜出发继续工作，路上虽然十分困难，跌跤、陷进雪坑、在冰上爬行，但是这些困难并没有减弱他帮助灾民的热情。一天一夜的严寒和劳累，又使他发烧发冷地在床上哼了一天。但是在第三天病稍好，他又继续坚持工作。他家有七口人，生活也很困难，但他为了解决灾民的困难，就把群众评给他的救济款拨给了别人。江西山同志的这种高贵品质，充分体现了我们党全心全意为劳动人民谋福利的伟大精神。
    我们党经常教育每一个党员应该热爱劳动人民，关心人民群众的生活和疾苦，想尽一切办法帮助贫苦劳动人民摆脱穷困，引导广大农民走社会主义的光明大道。像江西山同志这种优秀的共产党员，在我们党内是很多很多的。就是在同大雪严寒作斗争的安徽、湖北、湖南、江苏、江西等省生产救灾战线上，这样的党员就有着成千成万。无论在帮助灾民修理庵棚时，或者帮助灾民从不坚固的庵棚进行转移时；无论是在将大量物资巡回送到各村时，或者在组织群众扫除公路积雪保证物资顺利运入灾区时；无论在及时发放寒衣、棉被和救济款救济最困难的灾民时，或者组织非灾区人民大量出售柴草帮助灾民时；他们都充分地表现出了一个共产主义者所应有的精神和气魄。
    对于遭受灾害的人民，共产党和人民政府从来是以关怀备至的高度热情和坚决迅速的战斗作风来进行抢救的，如用飞机空投粮食抢救遭受雪灾的牧民，用舰艇赶运粮食和修堤器材到水灾区，用大炮轰击即将成灾的黄河凌汛；大批的救济物资包括粮食、柴炭、衣物、牛草、菜蔬、药品等等，更是尽速直接送到灾民手里，正如湖北沔阳县八区沙毛咀乡灾民张怀金在看到区委书记等人冒雪送来大米和棉衣时所说：“共产党和人民政府把人看得多么贵重啊！巴不得把饭喂到我们没吃的人的嘴里来，太好了，太好了！”江西山同志等这种高贵品质，也正是我们共产党人的崇高精神的具体表现。
    我们党是工人阶级的政党，它不只是要推翻制造灾害和苦难的人剥削人的社会制度，而且在这一革命成功以后，当我们的经济建设在突飞猛进、当广大人民群众的生活在不断改善的时候，我们还必须逐步消除那些制造灾难的剥削制度的残余，还必须大力医治几千年来旧社会给人民遗留下来的创伤，还必须把广大农民群众引上永远摆脱穷困的合作化的富裕道路，还必须随时抢救遭受各种灾害的人民。我们是工人阶级的政党，我们的一切工作都要有鲜明的阶级立场，我们应该时时关心穷苦的劳动人民，热情地帮助他们；越是在人民困难的时候，党员干部越应该和人民群众在一起，为了他们的利益不惜牺牲自己的一切，像江西山同志所表现的那样。
    在我们党员干部中，也有一些人还缺乏这种热爱劳动人民关心劳动人民的生活和疾苦的精神，他们对待救灾工作十分不负责任；有的对待穷苦的灾民不只是不同情和帮助，还感到讨厌，甚至对灾民进行打击中伤；有的不把救济粮款和寒衣及时发给贫苦的灾民，反而去发给地主富农分子；有的竟至诈骗和贪污灾民的救济物资，完全堕落为毫无心肝的人面禽兽。在农业合作化运动中，也有这种缺乏阶级立场的党员干部，他们嫌贫爱富，拒绝贫农参加农业生产合作社；或者歪曲党的政策，在农业生产合作社中处处使贫农吃亏，对贫农进行变相剥削。在农村其他工作中，也有对贫农冷淡、甚至欺侮贫农和打击贫农的现象。
    这都说明地方党组织对这些党员干部还缺乏经常性的阶级教育，因而这些人在革命胜利以后，由于自己生活上升了，就慢慢地忘了本，忘记了贫苦的劳动人民，阶级立场就慢慢模糊起来了。有些党员干部竟至错误地认为有的地主、富农“听话”、“意见少，问题少，好领导”；对于贫农反而觉得“讨厌”、“意见多，问题多，难领导”。请看这种对地主富农亲近而对贫苦劳动人民疏远的没有阶级立场的思想和行为是多么危险！
    各地党组织应该加强对党员的阶级教育，要善于运用像江西山同志这种优秀的事迹和一些缺乏阶级立场或者丧失阶级立场的事例，对比起来，向广大党员进行阶级教育；把这种阶级教育经常化起来，要在宣传、教育和贯彻党的各项政策时，要在各项实际工作的进行过程中，经常注意提高党员的阶级观念和锻炼他们的阶级立场，使每一个党员都成为具有鲜明的阶级立场的优秀工人阶级的先进战士。
