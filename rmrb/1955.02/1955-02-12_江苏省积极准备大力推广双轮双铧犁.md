Jiangsu Province will promote 14,000 double-wheel, double-share plows this year, which is more than fifteen times the number promoted in the past few years. At present, the province is actively preparing for the promotion and supply of double-wheel, double-share plows.

The Jiangsu Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative has already transported 2,823 double-wheel, double-share plows from the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, and has supplied 2,015 to agricultural production cooperatives in various counties. The first batch of 400 double-wheel, double-share plows produced by the Xuzhou Iron Factory will also be successively transported to various counties for supply to farmers during the spring plowing season.

In order to cultivate technical personnel for the promotion of double-wheel, double-share plows, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative have successively held short-term training courses in Xuzhou, Huaiyin, Suzhou, Nantong and other places; now more than 370 people have been trained as new agricultural tool experts who "can speak, can use, can disassemble, can assemble, and can find problems." Binhai, Lianshui, Suining, Changshu and other counties have also held training courses to train a large number of staff. The Production Materials Management Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative also sent people to Songjiang, Jiangdu, Huaiyin and other counties to conduct field trials of double-wheel, double-share plows and impart technology. During the test in Changshu County, they taught some farmers to use double-wheel, double-share plows in paddy fields, using facts to break the saying that "double-wheel, double-share plows are not suitable for paddy field areas," setting an example for the promotion of double-wheel, double-share plows in paddy field areas.

    江苏省积极准备大力推广双轮双铧犁
    江苏省今年将推广双轮双铧犁一万四千部，相当于几年来已经推广部数的十五倍以上。目前，全省推广和供应双轮双铧犁的准备工作正在积极进行。
    江苏省供销合作社已经从北京农业机械厂运到二千八百二十三部双轮双铧犁，并已将二千零十五部供应给各县农业生产合作社。徐州铁工厂第一批生产的四百部双轮双铧犁，也将在春耕期间陆续运往各县供应农民。
    为了培养推广双轮双铧犁的技术人材，江苏省农林厅和供销合作社，先后在徐州、淮阴、苏州、南通等地举办了短期训练班；现在有三百七十多个人已经训练成“能说、能用、能拆、能装、能找毛病”的新农具手。滨海、涟水、睢宁、常熟等县，也举办训练班训练了大批工作人员。江苏省供销合作社生产资料经理部，还派人把双轮双铧犁运到松江、江都、淮阴等县实地试验，传授技术。在常熟县试验时，教会一部分农民在水田里使用双轮双铧犁，用事实打破了“水田地区不适用双轮双铧犁”的说法，为在水田地区推广双轮双铧犁做出了榜样。（本报集体通讯员南京新华日报编辑部）
