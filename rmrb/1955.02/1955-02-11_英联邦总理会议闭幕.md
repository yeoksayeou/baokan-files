Xinhua News Agency, London, February 10th: The Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, which opened in London on January 31st, concluded on February 8th.

    The final communique issued after the conference closed stated that the governments of the Commonwealth member states would strive to ease international tensions. The communique pointed out that the Prime Ministers were meeting at a time when the Far Eastern situation was tense. "They believe that their discussions at this meeting will provide a valuable basis for future consultations between themselves and with directly concerned countries and for the formulation of their policies on this issue."

    The communique pointed out that the Commonwealth Prime Ministers "considered the problem of nuclear energy with concern" and noted that "the destructive power of new weapons makes it necessary to act with reason and to prevent war." The Federal Prime Ministers also expressed their desire for an international disarmament agreement, and the communique stated that "if an international agreement on disarmament is reached, it will be possible to gradually divert vast resources of atomic energy to the benefit of mankind."

    The communique touched on the economic problems of the Commonwealth countries, which the Federal Prime Ministers' Conference originally planned to focus on. The communique stated that the Federal Prime Ministers would continue to promote "the widest possible system of trade and payments that would best serve the interests of the Sterling Area and Canada." It was reported that at the meeting on the economic problems of the Sterling Area on the 3rd, speakers expressed dissatisfaction with the United States' foreign trade policy.

    Referring to the London and Paris Agreements on the rearmament of West Germany, the communique indicated that the Federal countries participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization were in favor of the early ratification of the London and Paris Agreements. A separate statement on so-called "defense" talks (in which India and Ceylon did not participate), published simultaneously with this communique, also indicated support for the Western countries' policy of establishing the strength of the North Atlantic aggressive forces in Europe. This statement also stated that a series of talks on "defense" issues studied the "defense" issues of the Middle East and Southeast Asia, discussed various plans to suppress national independence movements in Southeast Asian countries, and emphasized the "great importance" of suppressing the Malayan people's movement. The statement emphasized the policy of regional "defense" and pointed out that the Federal countries related to the Malayan region "recognize the need to maintain the closest contact with the United States in terms of defense measures."
