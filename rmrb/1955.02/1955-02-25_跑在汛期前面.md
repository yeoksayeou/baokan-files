    Running Ahead of the Flood Season
    By Our Correspondent Cao Baoming
    With only three months left until the flood season, nearly 40,000 people in Wuhan are working intensely on repairing the dikes, spurred on by the slogan "Run Ahead of the Flood Season." Around the Zhanggong Dike, Yellow Crane Tower, and Qingchuan Pavilion, one can see teams of workers everywhere, braving the wind and rain, digging mud from the riverbanks, building protective slopes with stones, and compacting the dike body with stone tampers.
    The people of Wuhan, having overcome the largest flood in history, began fundamental dike construction projects last October. Before this year's flood season, they aim to completely renovate all the temporary works from last year's flood, thoroughly rebuild dangerous works like the Longkou area, construct "clay core cut-off walls" in leaky earthen dikes to prevent seepage, and build nearly 5,000 meters of modern dikes along the Yangtze and Han Rivers. This will comprehensively raise and reinforce the 138-kilometer dike system, making it strong enough to withstand a flood like last year's. The project is enormous, requiring over 6 million cubic meters of earth. This amount of earth could build a dike two meters wide, two and seven-tenths meters high, and as long as the Beijing-Hankou Railway. It also requires 500,000 cubic meters of sand and gravel, more than one and a half times the amount used for the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project. So far, they have completed the entire renovation of the Hankou riverside waterproof dikes, the roadbed engineering of the dike-foot highway on the Wuqing Dike, and the Dike Corner Highway, completing over 3 million cubic meters of earthwork and 7,000 piles.
    To ensure the timely completion of this project, more than 15,000 farmers from eight counties including Huanggang in Hubei Province have been sent to participate in dike construction. Wuhan's state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives guarantee the supply of over 100,000 jin of grain, vegetables, and other living materials daily. The sand and gravel for Wuhan's dikes must be transported from hundreds of miles around, and the Beijing-Hankou and Guangdong-Hankou Railways, as well as the Yangtze River and Hubei Inland Navigation Administrations, are doing their best to transport them.
    To ensure the completion of this project before the flood season, some employees continue to work in the water, even in freezing temperatures and heavy snow. Farmers have also changed their old habits and are continuing construction during the Spring Festival. They have also come up with many ways to improve work efficiency. Now, the Han River has risen back to an elevation of 15 meters, but the employees working hard on the newly built outer dike of Hanzheng Street have essentially completed the foundation work below 16 meters. They are racing against the flood in a tense struggle!

### 跑在汛期前面

    跑在汛期前面
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    离汛期只有三个多月了。武汉市近四万人正在“跑在汛期前面”口号的鼓舞下，紧张地修筑堤防。在张公堤、黄鹤楼和晴川阁一带，随处都可以看见成队的工人，他们冒着风雨，从江湖滩上挖取泥土，用石块筑砌护脚坦坡，用石硪打紧堤身。
    战胜了历史上最大洪水的武汉人民，从去年十月就开始了基本建设性的堤防修建工程。他们要在今年汛期以前，将去年汛期中的临时工程全部翻修，将龙口等处的险工彻底改建，在漏水的土堤内修筑“粘土抽槽隔渗”，在长江汉水边新修建将近五千公尺的现代化堤防，使长达一百三十八公里的堤防全面加高加固，足以挡住像去年那样的洪水。工程是这样的巨大，它所需的泥土达六百多万公方，这些泥土可以修筑一条两公尺宽、二点七公尺高、有京汉铁路这样长的一条堤防；所需的砂石达五十万公方，比荆江分洪工程的砂石用量还多一倍半。到现在为止，他们已完成了整修汉口沿江防水土堤的全部工程、武青堤的堤脚公路和堤角公路的路基工程，共完成了三百多万土方和七千根桩。
    为了保证按期完成这个工程，湖北省黄冈等八个县派了一万五千多名农民来参加堤防建设。武汉市国营商业和合作社保证了每天十多万斤粮食、菜蔬等生活资料的供应工作。武汉堤防的砂石要从周围数百里地运来，京汉、粤汉铁路，长江、湖北内河航运等管理局都尽力运送。
    为了保证在汛期前完成这个工程，在天寒地冻大雪纷飞的日子里，有的员工们也照常下水坚持工作。农民们也改变了旧有的习惯，在春节期间继续施工。他们还想了许多办法提高工效。现在，汉水已回涨到标高十五公尺，但在新建的汉正街外堤防紧张劳动的员工们，已将十六公尺以下的基础工程基本完成。他们在紧张地和洪水赛跑！
