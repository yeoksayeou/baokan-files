    Beijing Municipal People's Committee Holds First Meeting
    Decisions Made to Improve Health Work and Develop Suburban Agricultural Production

   [This newspaper dispatch] The Beijing Municipal People's Committee held its first meeting on the afternoon of the 18th. The meeting first discussed the implementation of the resolutions of the Second Session of the First Beijing Municipal People's Congress and decided to undertake the following tasks:

    1.  To improve Beijing's health work, the Public Health Bureau is instructed to comprehensively plan and uniformly deploy the city's health and medical work, utilize the city's medical equipment and personnel, and implement a system of graded responsibility, based on the resolutions of the Congress, the opinions of the representatives, and the concluding remarks made by Mayor Peng Zhen on behalf of the Presidium of the Congress, and to strengthen leadership; efforts should be made to free more experienced doctors from matters outside of medical work, concentrate their energies as much as possible on treating major and difficult diseases, engage in research, summarize medical work experience, guide medical work, and train medical cadres; to carry out regular mass sanitation campaigns and propose simple, understandable, and effective goals for different groups.

    2.  Regarding the development of agricultural production in the suburbs and the promotion of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, the Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry is instructed to earnestly implement the proposed measures, referring to the opinions of the representatives.

    3.  The Second Session of the First People's Congress received 66 proposals from representatives, which were handed over to the Municipal People's Committee for handling, and 38 were handed over to the Municipal People's Committee for research and processing. These proposals have been distributed by the General Office to the relevant departments, and the original proposing representatives have been notified. All relevant departments are required to seriously handle these proposals and report to the Municipal People's Committee.

    The meeting discussed the organizational structure of the Municipal People's Committee. Based on the actual needs of the city's work, and following the principles of clear division of labor, specialized responsibility, fewer levels, and streamlined organization, the meeting decided to make necessary adjustments to the organizational structure of the original Municipal People's Government.

    Subsequently, Mayor Peng Zhen spoke about some of the current situations and problems in Beijing's work. He requested that the responsible personnel of all departments under the Municipal People's Committee carefully study and examine the work of their respective departments, and bring important issues in their work to the Municipal People's Committee for examination, discussion, and resolution. He said that we must resolutely overcome the serious bureaucracy and red tape that exist within our Municipal People's Committee and its departments – these non-working-class styles. We must earnestly learn and implement the style of timely discovering problems, raising problems, systematically solving problems, and implementing decisions. He said that the Municipal People's Committee should take measures to rectify the working style of government offices.

    After Mayor Peng Zhen's speech, the meeting engaged in a broad discussion. Shu Sheyu, Zheng Yun, Fu Zhongsun, Xu Chubo, Li Kezuo, Wu Han, Li Guorui, Xue Zizheng, and others spoke at the meeting.

    Finally, Mayor Peng Zhen made conclusions on the issues raised in the discussion. He focused on the issue of construction. He said: At present, the main approach to solving the management of construction affairs should start from these aspects: First, the annual construction tasks must be arranged uniformly according to the degree of importance and urgency, deciding which buildings can be built this year and which cannot; and notifying those units that cannot be built this year as soon as possible, so that they do not expect and run around "negotiating"; second, since construction affairs involve many aspects, we should continue to use the very effective experience of joint offices in the past, with the Urban Planning Bureau bringing together cadres from relevant parties to work together, assisting the construction management authorities and the public and private owners who want to carry out construction, undertaking all the procedures to be handled, and concentrating all issues related to construction there; third, the Urban Planning Bureau should study and classify various issues in construction affairs in detail, and make separate regulations, managing well what should be managed, managing less what cannot be fully managed today, and determining that what should not be managed or cannot be managed temporarily should not be managed temporarily; fourth, regarding the issue of architectural style, we have clearly stated three years ago that the municipal government departments should not force people to build houses with large roofs, and at the same time, as long as the building does not hinder the overall urban plan, it should not be managed; now, some people in charge of the construction department are abusing their power everywhere, arbitrarily interfering with the architectural style, forcing people to build large roofs, or forcing people to "do this" or "do that," and the municipal government has not given them this right. The head of the construction department should conduct a serious inspection and handling of those who force people to build large roofs or other abuses of power. Regarding the allocation of labor, Mayor Peng Zhen said that the allocation of labor should be uniformly managed by the Labor Bureau, and no unit should employ people privately without organization or planning, but the Labor Bureau should seriously study the needs of all parties and the situation of available labor, and allocate people to each unit who are suitable for the needs of these units.

    北京市人民委员会举行首次会议
    决定改进卫生工作和发展郊区农业生产等项
   【本报讯】北京市人民委员会在十八日下午举行了第一次会议。会议首先讨论了贯彻执行北京市第一届人民代表大会第二次会议的决议问题，决定做下列几项工作：
    一、改进北京市卫生工作，责成公共卫生局根据大会决议和代表们所提意见以及彭真市长代表大会主席团所作的总结发言，对全市卫生、医疗工作通盘计划、统一部署、运用全市医疗设备和医疗力量，实行分级负责的办法，并加强领导；力求使经验比较丰富的医生摆脱医疗工作以外的事务，尽可能集中精力治疗重大的疑难病症，从事研究工作，总结医疗工作经验，指导医疗工作和培养医务干部工作；开展经常性的群众卫生运动，根据不同的对象，提出简明易懂而又切实有效的奋斗目标。
    二、关于发展郊区农业生产和开展互助合作运动的工作，责成农林局根据所提出的各项措施，并参照代表们所提意见，认真贯彻。
    三、第一届人民代表大会第二次会议收到代表提案，交市人民委员会办理的六十六件，交市人民委员会研究处理的三十八件。这些提案由办公厅分交主管部门，并通知原提案的代表。要求各主管部门认真处理这些提案，并向市人民委员会报告。
    会议讨论了关于市人民委员会的组织机构问题，会议根据本市实际工作的需要，按照分工明确、责任专、层次少和精简编制的原则，决定对原市人民政府的组织机构加以必要的调整。
    接着，彭真市长谈了目前北京市工作中的一些情况和问题。他要求市人民委员会所属各部门的负责工作人员，认真研究和检查自己主管部门的工作，把工作中的重要问题提到市人民委员会来进行检查、讨论解决。他说，要切实克服我们市人民委员会本身和各部门中严重地存在着的官僚主义和文牍主义——这些非工人阶级的作风。要切实学习和贯彻及时发现问题、提出问题、系统地解决问题和把决定贯彻执行的作风。他说，市人民委员会要采取措施，整顿机关的工作作风。
    彭真市长讲话以后，会议展开了广泛的讨论。舒舍予、郑芸、傅种孙、徐楚波、李克佐、吴晗、李国瑞、薛子正等都在会上讲了话。
    最后，彭真市长就讨论中所提出的问题作了结论。他着重讲了建筑方面的问题。他说：现在，解决建筑事务管理问题的办法，主要应从这几方面着手：第一、对于全年的建筑任务，必须按照轻重缓急，统一安排，决定哪些建筑今年能建，哪些今年不能建；并尽早通知那些今年不能兴建的单位，使他们不要期待和跑来跑去地“交涉”；第二、建筑事务既然牵涉到很多方面，应该继续运用过去行之很有效的联合办公的经验，由都市规划管理局把有关方面的干部集合在一起办公，协助建筑管理机关和要进行建筑的公、私业主，承办一切要办的手续，把有关建筑的一切问题都集中到那里去办；第三、都市规划管理局应详加研究分类处理建筑事务中的各种问题，分别作出规定，该管的就管好，今天还不可能完全管也可以少管的就少管，不该管或暂时不能管的就确定暂时不管；第四、关于建筑形式问题，我们在三年前就已经明白交代过，市政府主管部门不要强迫人家盖大屋顶的房子，同时，建筑物只要不妨碍都市总规划，就不要去管；现在，主管建筑部门的有些人，到处滥用职权，对建筑形式任意干涉，强迫人家盖大屋顶，或强迫人家
  “这样”“那样”，而市政府是没有给他们这种权利的。主管建筑的首长要对那些强迫人家盖大屋顶或其他滥用职权的事情进行严肃的检查和处理。关于劳动力的调配问题，彭真市长说，劳动力的调配应统一由劳动局掌管，各单位不得无组织无计划的私自用人，但是，劳动局应认真研究各方面的需要，和可以调配的劳动力的情况，调配给各单位的人要适合这些单位工作的需要。
