Since the fourth quarter of last year, state-owned commercial enterprises have stopped selling goods to cooperative businesses on credit. This was originally intended to promote further improvement in the operation and management of cooperative businesses, but many supply and marketing cooperatives in Liaoning Province experienced a shortage of goods and a decrease in turnover. The reason is that in the past, supply and marketing cooperatives could get goods from state-owned stores by issuing IOUs, but after the credit sales were stopped, they had to borrow money from the bank (credit) before going to state-owned stores to purchase goods. In this way, each time they purchased goods, the supply and marketing cooperatives increased their interest burden. Many supply and marketing cooperatives, fearing high interest expenses, were not active in purchasing goods from state-owned stores and relied only on their own limited funds to maintain operations. In order to prevent this small amount of capital from being tied up, the erroneous ideas and practices of "buy a little, sell a little" or "emphasize purchasing, neglect sales" (because purchasing does not occupy the cooperative's own funds, has a fast turnover, and can generate more profit) arose. For example, the Xinhua Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Beizhen County reduced its business varieties by 91 compared to before the credit sales were stopped. Even winter supplies that were most needed by the local people, such as felt shoes, felt lumps, cotton men's shoes, old ladies' hats, thermos bottles, and wooden mirrors, were not available. There were only three and a half jin of cotton and only four pairs of children's socks left. Due to the significant reduction in business varieties, industrial products that should not have been out of stock were also out of stock in rural areas. Farmers were dissatisfied because they could not buy the goods that could have been supplied, and the supply and marketing cooperatives also lost money due to the decrease in turnover.

In order to reverse this phenomenon, the state-owned commercial departments in Liaoning Province, in response to the ideological concerns of the supply and marketing cooperatives, focused on the following aspects and achieved certain results.

The fear that goods would not be sold after purchase and would become tied up is a major concern after the cessation of credit sales. The main reason for this concern is the insufficient understanding of the changing needs of the people in the peak season market. They only saw that their existing goods could not be sold for a while and were tying up funds, but they were not actively organizing new goods that the masses needed. As a result, the new goods became less and less, and the old goods became more and more tied up, and therefore they were more and more afraid to purchase goods. To help supply and marketing cooperatives eliminate this ideological concern, it is first necessary to help supply and marketing cooperative cadres further recognize the important role of cooperative commerce in connecting urban and rural material exchanges in the peak season market, understand the growing new demands of farmers for industrial products, and help them formulate plans and actively organize purchases according to the needs of the masses. The Beizhen County Department Store, through an industrial products exhibition held in Dasi Fort Village, helped the village's supply and marketing cooperative understand the village's needs for commodity varieties and the total purchasing power of the entire village. It also conducted a typical survey through "family meetings." The supply and marketing cooperative immediately purchased 75 kinds of commodities, worth more than 18 million yuan, based on the needs of the masses and the income and expenditure situation. All the supply and marketing cooperatives that understood the needs and income and expenditure situation of the masses actively purchased goods. The salespersons said: "After the state-owned commerce stopped selling goods to supply and marketing cooperatives on credit, it is even more impossible to stay at home and wait!" The farmers said: "The cooperative is really impressive."

Secondly, it is necessary to help the supply and marketing cooperatives turn dead capital into live capital, and help exchange goods that are not suitable for sale locally and have been tied up for a long time to places suitable for sales, and exchange them for new goods. The Tieling County Department Store set up a "special exchange counter" for supply and marketing cooperatives in the wholesale store. After the goods tied up by the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives were displayed, many goods played a regulatory role through this "exchange counter." Dozens of kinds of goods, such as "raincoats," "over-the-knee socks," and "children's mosquito nets," which had been tied up in rural supply and marketing cooperatives for a long time, were exchanged to urban consumer cooperatives and found sales channels. A liaison officer from the Faku County Department Store went to the countryside and found that the Badger Cave Supply and Marketing Cooperative had a backlog of batteries, while the Yemaotai Supply and Marketing Cooperative was out of batteries. After helping to adjust each other, many batteries were sold as soon as they arrived in Yemaotai.

In addition, helping to increase commodity knowledge is also a way to increase the interest of supply and marketing cooperatives in operating industrial products. Many supply and marketing cooperatives are unwilling to operate enamel products and ceramic products because these commodities have high losses and they are afraid of losing money. They are also afraid to operate some new varieties because they have no experience, and they shrink back and only like to operate a few kinds of "common goods." Therefore, helping supply and marketing cooperatives increase their commodity knowledge is of practical significance for supply and marketing cooperatives to increase their business varieties, improve their operations, and accelerate capital turnover. The Tieling County Department Store added content introducing commodity knowledge and sales experience to the "Commodity Catalog." As soon as the "Commodity Catalog" arrived at the supply and marketing cooperatives, the salespersons rushed to read it, which greatly increased the interest of the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in operating industrial products.

Helping supply and marketing cooperatives at all times can effectively solve the ideological problem of supply and marketing cooperatives "fearing that state-owned companies will push them out the door and not care." Some supply and marketing cooperative cadres said: "The state-owned companies say it very nicely, but they think they have completed the task as long as they give the goods to the cooperative, and they don't care whether you are tied up or not." This kind of thinking played a more dominant role to some extent after the state-owned companies stopped selling goods to cooperatives on credit. Therefore, at the same time that state-owned stores sell goods to supply and marketing cooperatives, they should help study commodity sales and promotion methods, so that supply and marketing cooperatives "have a bottom in their hearts when purchasing goods, and are happy when promoting sales"; they no longer think that after purchasing goods, it is "the cooperative is tied up, and the state-owned company has completed the task." Wang Shih-han, the model salesperson of the Nan Zhamu Store in Xinbin County, has the main experience of helping supply and marketing cooperatives when selling goods, helping supply and marketing cooperatives study the varieties and quantities of goods to be ordered. Sometimes the supply and marketing cooperative's plan is not accurate, and the quantity is too much, he helps calculate the accounts and order less, or change to take some other varieties. The cadres of the supply and marketing cooperatives gratefully said: "The state-owned stores care about us too much."

In addition, consolidating and improving Sun Fangzhi's "four contact system" of the Fengcheng County Department Store is also an important method to further strengthen the relationship between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce. The Fengcheng County Department Store consolidated the "liaison officer going to the countryside system" by increasing liaison officers, establishing liaison groups, and establishing a "liaison officer work report registration book." In addition, in the "Commodity Catalog" printed for the supply and marketing cooperatives, in addition to the original items such as product name, specifications, quality, and price, the colors, quantities, and numbers were added, consolidating the "commodity catalog going to the countryside system." After the Dabao Ying Supply and Marketing Cooperative added 71 new varieties, its commercial correspondent wrote in a letter: "Because your catalog indicates the number, color, and number of pairs of sneakers and rubber shoes, we dare to order goods, otherwise we would not dare to order goods without a bottom in our hearts." They also consolidated the "purchase registration card system" by hiring correspondents and establishing a registration book for receiving and sending letters. Because these systems have been consolidated and have achieved certain development, after the cessation of credit sales to cooperatives in the third quarter, the relationship between state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce has been further strengthened, and the state plan has been overfulfilled.

    辽宁省国营商业帮助供销合作社扩大了经营品种
    程建中
    国营商业自去年第四季度开始停止对合作社商业赊售货物。这样做本来是可以促进合作社商业进一步改善经营管理的，但是辽宁省有许多供销合作社却商品脱销，营业额减少了。原因是：过去供销合作社到国营商店可以打欠条就拿货，停止赊售后，要先到银行借了钱（信贷），再到国营商店进货。这样，每进一次货，供销合作社就增加了一定的利息负担。许多供销合作社怕利息开支大，不积极向国营商店进货，只靠自己少数资金维持经营。为了不使这少数资金积压，就产生了“买点卖点”或“重收购轻推销”（因收购不占合作社自己资金，周转快，又能多得利润）的错误思想和作法。如北镇县新华供销合作社经营的品种就较停止赊售前减少了九十一种，连当地群众最需要的冬季用品如毡鞋、毡疙瘩、棉男鞋、老太太帽子、暖水瓶、木板镜子等都没有，棉花只剩了三斤三两，小孩袜子只有四双。由于经营的品种减少了很多，不应脱销的工业品在农村也脱销了，农民因买不到本来可以供应的商品而不满意，供销合作社也因为营业额减少而赔了钱。
    为了扭转这种现象，辽宁省国营商业部门针对供销合作社存在的思想顾虑，着重从以下几方面进行了工作，并收到了一定的效果。
    供销合作社怕进货后卖不出去造成积压，是停止赊售后的一个主要顾虑。产生这个顾虑的主要原因是对旺季市场上人民增长着的需要变化认识不足，只看到自己现有的商品一时卖不出去积压了资金，却不积极组织群众需要的新的商品，以致新货愈少，陈货愈积压，因而愈不敢进货。帮助供销合作社消除这个思想顾虑，首先要帮助供销合作社干部进一步认识合作社商业在旺季市场上沟通城乡物资交流的重要作用，了解农民对工业品不断增长的新要求，并根据群众需要，帮助订计划，积极组织进货。北镇县百货公司通过在大寺堡子村举行的工业品展览会，帮助该村供销合作社了解该村群众对商品品种的需要及全村购买力共有多少，又通过“家庭会议”作了典型的调查。供销合作社根据群众需要和收支情况，当时就进了七十五种商品，价值一千八百余万元。凡是了解了群众需要和收支情况的供销合作社都积极进货了，营业员们说：“国营商业停止对供销合作社赊售后，再守在家里等着更不行啦！”农民说：“合作社真像样了”。
    其次要帮助供销合作社把死资金变成活资金，帮助把在本地不适销而长期积压的商品交流到适合销路的地方去，换进新商品来。铁岭县百货公司在批发商店为供销合作社设了一个“专用交流柜台”，把基层供销合作社积压的商品摆出后，许多商品通过这个“交流柜台”起了调剂作用。把在农村供销合作社积压已久的“雨衣”、“过膝袜子”、“小孩蚊帐”等数十种商品交流到城市消费合作社，并找到了销路。法库县百货公司联络员下乡发现獾子洞供销合作社电池积压，而叶茂台供销合作社电池脱销，经帮助互相调剂后，货到叶茂台当时就卖去很多。
    另外，帮助增加商品知识也是提高供销合作社经营工业品兴趣的一个方法。许多供销合作社不愿经营珐琅品、陶瓷品，因为这些商品损失大、怕赔钱，对某些新品种由于没有经验也不敢经营，缩手缩脚地只喜欢经营几种“大路货”。因此，帮助供销合作社增加商品知识，对供销合作社增加经营品种，改善经营，加速资金周转就有实际意义。铁岭县百货公司在“商品目录”上加了一个介绍商品知识和推销经验的内容。“商品目录”一到供销合作社，营业员就抢着看，大大提高了基层供销合作社经营工业品的兴趣。
    时时帮助供销合作社打算，可以有效地解决供销合作社“怕国营公司推出门不管”的思想。有些供销合作社干部说：“国营公司说的挺好，就是把货给合作社就算完成任务了，你积压不积压他不管”。这种思想在国营公司对合作社停止赊售后，在某种程度上更起了支配作用。因此，国营商店向供销合作社卖出商品的同时，就应当帮助研究商品销路和推销方法，使供销合作社“进货时心中有底，推销时精神愉快”；不再认为进货后是“合作社积压，国营公司完成任务”。新宾县南札木商店的模范营业员王世汉的主要经验，是在卖货时帮助供销合作社打算，帮助供销合作社研究要货的品种和数量，有时供销合作社计划不准，数量要多了，他就帮助算账少要些，或改拿些别的品种。供销合作社干部感激地说：“国营商店太关心我们了。”
    此外，巩固和提高凤城县百货公司孙芳芝的
  “四项联系制度”也是进一步密切国营商业同合作社商业关系的重要方法。凤城县百货公司通过增加联络员，成立联络组，建立“联络员工作汇报登记簿”等方法巩固了“联络员下乡制度”。此外，在给供销合作社印发的“商品目录”上，除原有品名、规格、质量、价格等项外，增加了色泽、数量、号码，巩固了“商品目录下乡制度”。大堡应供销合作社在增加七十一种新品种后，它的商业通讯员来信说：“由于你们目录上面注明了球鞋、胶鞋的号码、色泽、双数，我们就敢要货了，不然心里没底是不敢要货的。”他们还通过聘请通讯员，建立收发信件登记簿等方法巩固了“购货登记卡片制度”。因为这些制度得到巩固和有了一定的发展，在第三季度对合作社停止赊售后，又进一步密切了国营商业同合作社商业双方的关系，超额完成了国家计划。
