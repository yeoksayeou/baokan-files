To the esteemed comrades of the People's Liberation Army, care of the editor:

    When the news of your victory in liberating Yijiangshan Island reached Korea, the sentries of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army stationed on the front lines, the sailors guarding the sea, and the students studying in schools were all singing with joy, singing of the victory of the people of the motherland, singing of your glorious achievements!

    Respected comrades, you must want to know about our work, study, and life in Korea since the armistice. Korea in the past year is very different from before the ceasefire. At that time, the flames of war raged across Korea, loving mothers could not find their children, and lovely children lost their loving mothers. People lived a displaced life in the years of war. Now, buildings are being erected one after another in the cities. On the iron bridges over the Chongchon River and the Taedong River, trains are fully loaded with raw materials being transported to newly built factories. Innocent and lively children, like the children of the motherland, walk towards their favorite schools, greeting the rising sun. Middle-aged people carry hoes and walk smilingly toward the wheat fields. The mountains and plains here are being built by diligent hands into gardens. In the evening, walking on the wide roads, you can hear news of new production records from factories from loudspeakers, and you can also hear your joyful songs from the motherland's coast and borders. We firmly believe that tomorrow's Korea will be built even more beautifully, and the people's lives will be even happier.

    The commanders and fighters stationed on the glorious 38th Parallel, and the troops stationed on the coastlines, guard the east and west coasts day and night, resolutely preventing enemy ships from sailing and provoking in the peaceful seas. In order to more confidently extinguish the flames of war and defend peace, many excellent shooters emerged in our unit during last year's winter military training. In just four short months, they learned individual attacks all the way to battalion and regimental attacks, and were able to skillfully use their weapons and cleverly command battles, laying a solid foundation for modern tactics. Let me report on the achievements of an ordinary company: more than two-thirds of the comrades in the Second Company have been awarded the title of excellent shooter, and the rest have achieved good results, with only three people performing slightly worse; the Ninth Squad is also an ordinary squad, and nine of them scored four hits out of four shots. It is gratifying that the comrades have achieved such results, and now they have all expressed their determination to maintain their current achievements, study and train hard, and strive for even greater achievements, so as to support you in liberating Taiwan with practical actions.

    Many commanders, in order to quickly improve their education, study their textbooks diligently in the face of the piercing cold wind. For example, Comrade Yang Jinggui of the Sixth Group had a relatively poor educational foundation, but he never lost heart. At night, when his comrades were sleeping soundly, he would turn on a flashlight in his blanket, or run to the streetlights to review the day's lessons. Now he is an excellent student. There are many such deeds, and Comrade Yang Jinggui is just one of many soldiers.

    Comrades! Taiwan has been Chinese territory since ancient times. In order to liberate Taiwan, let us join hands tightly in different places and different positions, and contribute our greatest strength to smash the US-Chiang Mutual Defense Treaty and liberate the territory of the motherland—Taiwan!

    Finally, I wish you victory after victory!

### 我们在朝鲜的工作学习和生活

专栏：

    我们在朝鲜的工作学习和生活编辑同志请转敬爱的人民解放军同志们：
    当你们解放一江山岛的捷报传到朝鲜的时候，中国人民志愿军驻守在前线上的哨兵，驻守在海洋上的水兵，在学校里学习的学员，都在尽情地歌唱，歌唱祖国人民的胜利，歌唱你们的光辉业迹！
    敬爱的同志们，你们一定想知道停战以来我们在朝鲜的工作、学习和生活吧，一年来的朝鲜，同停战前大不相同了，那时候，战火烧遍了朝鲜，慈爱的母亲找不到自己的孩子，可爱的孩子们失去了慈爱的母亲，人们在战争的年代里过着流离失所的生活。现在呢，城市里接二连三地竖起一幢一幢大厦，清川江和大同江的铁桥上，火车满载着原料运到新建的工厂里去；天真活泼的孩子和祖国的小朋友们一样，迎着初升的太阳，走上他们最爱逗留的学校里去；中年人扛着锄头，笑嘻嘻地走向麦地。这里的山洼和平原，由人们勤劳的手建设得像花园一样了。傍晚，走在宽阔的公路上，可以听到从扩音器里送来工厂生产新纪录的消息，也可以听到从祖国海防、边疆传来了你们的愉快歌声……。我们深信明天的朝鲜会建设得更美丽，人民的生活会过得更幸福。
    驻守在光辉的三八线的指战员们，和驻守在海防线的部队，日夜守卫在东西海岸，决不让敌人的舰艇在和平的海洋上行驶和挑衅。为了更有把握地扑灭战火，保卫和平，在去年冬季军训中，我们单位里曾不断地涌现出许多优秀的射击手。仅是短短的四个月时间，他们学会了单个进攻一直到营、团进攻，能熟练地使用手中武器，机智地指挥战斗，为近代化的战术打下了牢固的基础。让我汇报一个普通连队的成绩吧：二连有三分之二以上的同志获得优秀射击手的称号，其余的同志都获得了良好的成绩，只有三个人的成绩稍差些；九班也是个普通的班，他们有九个人是四发四中。同志们获得这样的成绩，是一件可喜的事情，现在他们都一致表示决心：保持现有成绩，苦学苦练，争取更大的成绩，以实际行动来支援你们解放台湾。
    许多指挥员，为了迅速提高自己的文化，迎着刺骨的寒风熟读课文，如六组的杨京贵同志，原来的文化基础较差，可是他始终没有灰心。晚上，同志们睡得正香，他在被窝里打开电筒，或者跑到路灯下去复习一天的课程，现在他已是一个优秀的学员了。像这样的事迹很多，杨京贵同志不过是许多战士中的一个。
    同志们！台湾自古以来就是中国的领土，为了解放台湾，我们在不同的地方，不同的岗位上，紧紧地携起手来，为粉碎美蒋共同防御条约，为解放祖国的领土——台湾而贡献出我们最大的力量！
    最后祝你们胜利再胜利
