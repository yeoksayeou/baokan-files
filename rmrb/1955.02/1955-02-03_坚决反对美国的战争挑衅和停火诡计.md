Resolutely Oppose America's War Provocations and Ceasefire Ploys
Chen Shutong, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce

Recently, the U.S. Congress passed President Eisenhower's so-called special message regarding "the situation developing in the Taiwan Strait." It also granted Eisenhower broad powers to use armed forces to interfere in the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan and Penghu and to expand aggression against China.

This message is a war message through and through. In order to militarily intervene in China's liberation of Taiwan and expand its aggression against China, preparing for new war provocations, the United States has stipulated that Eisenhower's scope of action can include "related positions and territories" outside of Taiwan and Penghu, and he can take "other measures he deems necessary or appropriate." At the same time, the United States and the United Kingdom have instigated New Zealand to propose a so-called ceasefire suggestion, attempting to interfere in China's internal affairs through the United Nations, forcing the Chinese people to stop liberating Taiwan, Penghu, and other coastal islands, creating the so-called "two Chinas" fact, in order to completely sever China's territory. It is very clear that this is a naked war provocation by the United States against the Chinese people, and a vicious trick to turn Taiwan into an American base of aggression.

We resolutely oppose America's war provocations and its instigated ceasefire ploy. The United States' follower, the United Kingdom, in order to support the United States in obstructing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, its ambassador to the Soviet Union openly stated: "Putting aside the rights and wrongs of the matter completely," which fully exposes that the diplomacy of imperialism does not adhere to faith or right and wrong, and attempts to confuse right and wrong to deceive the people. Therefore, we must talk about the rights and wrongs of the Taiwan issue.

Taiwan is Chinese territory, which is universally recognized and cannot be changed by anyone. Liberating Taiwan and eliminating the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is China's sovereignty and internal affair, and no one is allowed to interfere. The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is the public enemy of the Chinese people, and the Chinese people have the right to eliminate it. Therefore, liberating Taiwan is entirely China's internal affair and will not cause international tension. Ironclad facts prove that the tense situation in the Taiwan region is only the result of the U.S. government occupying Taiwan, sheltering the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and interfering in China's internal affairs. At the same time, precisely because the United States occupies China's Taiwan, obstructing the Chinese people from liberating their own territory of Taiwan, all acts of aggression that undermine China's territorial integrity, threaten China's security, and disrupt peace in the Far East come entirely from the United States. The rights and wrongs are clear. And the United Kingdom, following the United States, absurdly insists on completely putting aside the rights and wrongs of the matter to discuss the so-called ceasefire issue. Doesn't this most clearly expose that the US and UK's instigation of New Zealand's ceasefire proposal is nothing more than an attempt to legalize the American occupation of Taiwan and exacerbate the threat of a new war in the Far East? This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people, and the people of the world will never be deceived by the conspiracies of the United States and its followers. At the same time, it must be pointed out that New Zealand's so-called ceasefire proposal also completely violates the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter. Premier Zhou's statement on January 24th mentioned Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the United Nations Charter: "Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter." This is very correct. The United Nations has no right to interfere in China's internal affairs, just as any member state of the United Nations has no right to interfere in China's internal affairs. In fact, today the United States has brazenly interfered in our internal affairs, violated our territorial sovereignty, and the United Nations should condemn and effectively stop the U.S.'s war provocations in accordance with the spirit of the Charter. This is the responsibility that the United Nations should bear.

The Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is a bandit gang that the Chinese people must eliminate, and Taiwan, which it has seized, is territory that the Chinese people must liberate. There is no question of a ceasefire between the Chinese people and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. New Zealand's so-called ceasefire proposal is actually a conspiracy by the United States and Britain to create the so-called "two Chinas." Eisenhower's special message is also a threat and blackmail by the United States against the Chinese people. But today's China is a newly born and powerful People's Republic of China, and cannot be intimidated by any conspiracy or threat. On the contrary, the Chinese people fully understand how to strike the aggressors.

Premier Zhou's statement solemnly pointed out: "In order to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, in order to safeguard China's security and peace in the Far East, the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, the United States must stop interfering in China's internal affairs, and all U.S. armed forces must withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait." This fully represents the firm will of the 600 million Chinese people, and we express our heartfelt support.

We, the national industrialists and businessmen, have profound historical lessons regarding the pain inflicted upon us by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Like the people of the whole country, we resolutely oppose the American war provocations and ceasefire schemes. No intimidation or blackmail can shake our determination to liberate Taiwan under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government. We, the national industrialists and businessmen, pledge to contribute all our strength to oppose all enemies at home and abroad, support the just struggle to liberate Taiwan, and smash the aggressors.

    坚决反对美国的战争挑衅和停火诡计
    中华全国工商业联合会主任委员　陈叔通
    最近美国国会通过了美国总统艾森豪威尔提出的所谓关于“正在台湾海峡发展的局势”的特别咨文。并授予艾森豪威尔使用武装部队干涉中国人民解放台湾和澎湖及对中国扩大侵略的广泛权力。
    这个咨文，是一个彻头彻尾的战争咨文。美国为了武装干涉中国解放台湾，扩大对中国的侵略，准备新的战争挑衅，一方面规定艾森豪威尔的行动范围可以包括台湾、澎湖以外“有关阵地和领土”，并且可以采取他认为“有必要的或适宜的其他措施”。同时，美国和英国又策动新西兰提出所谓停火的建议，企图通过联合国来干涉中国的内政，强迫中国人民停止解放台湾、澎湖和其他沿海岛屿，造成所谓“两个中国”的事实，来完全割裂中国的领土。很显明，这是美国赤裸裸的对中国人民的战争挑衅，并企图把台湾变为美国侵略基地的恶毒诡计。
    我们坚决反对美国的战争挑衅和它所策动的停火诡计。美国的追随者英国为了支持美国阻挠中国人民解放台湾，它的驻苏联大使竟公然说：“完全撇开事情的是非曲直不谈”，这完全暴露了帝国主义的外交是不讲信义不讲是非的，是企图混淆是非曲直欺骗人民的。因此，我们必须谈谈关于台湾这一事情的是非曲直。
    台湾是中国的领土，是举世公认的，任何人不能改变的。解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团是中国的主权和内政，决不容许别人干涉。蒋介石卖国集团是中国人民的公敌，中国人民有权消灭它，因此，解放台湾完全是中国的内政，决不会引起国际的紧张局势。铁一般的事实证明，造成目前台湾地区的紧张局势，只是由于美国政府侵占台湾、庇护蒋介石卖国集团、干涉中国内政的结果。同时正因为美国侵占中国的台湾，阻挠中国人民解放自己的领土台湾，所以破坏中国的领土完整、威胁中国安全、破坏远东和平的一切侵略行动，完全是来自美国，是非曲直，昭然若揭。而追随美国的英国，竟荒谬地主张完全撇开事情的是非曲直来谈所谓停火问题，这不就是最明显地暴露美英策动新西兰所提停火建议，无非是使美国侵占台湾变成合法化，并使远东新战争威胁加剧吗？这是中国人民所绝对不能容忍的，全世界人民也决不会受美国及其追随者的阴谋所欺骗。同时必须指出，新西兰的所谓停火建议也完全是违反联合国宪章的宗旨和原则的。周总理一月二十四日声明中提到联合国宪章第二条第七款：“本宪章不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件，且并不要求会员国将该项事件依本宪章提请解决。”这是非常正确的，联合国无权干涉中国的内政，正如联合国的任何一个会员国无权干涉中国的内政一样。事实上今天美国已悍然干涉我国内政，侵犯我国领土主权，联合国理应根据宪章的精神予以谴责并实际制止美国的战争挑衅行动，这才是联合国应有的责任。
    蒋介石卖国集团是中国人民必须消灭的匪帮，它所窃踞的台湾是中国人民必须解放的领土，中国人民和蒋介石卖国集团之间根本没有停火问题存在。新西兰的所谓停火建议，实际上就是美英想造成的所谓“两个中国”的阴谋诡计。艾森豪威尔的特别咨文，也就是美国对中国人民的恫吓与讹诈。但今日的中国，已经是一个新生强大的中华人民共和国了，决不是任何阴谋与恫吓所能吓倒的。相反的，中国人民完全懂得如何予侵略者以打击。
    周总理的声明中严正指出：“为了保障中国的主权和领土完整，为了保障中国的安全和远东的和平，中国人民必须解放台湾，美国必须停止对中国内政的干涉，美国的一切武装力量必须从台湾和台湾海峡撤走”。这是完全代表了全中国六万万人民的坚强意志，我们表示衷心拥护。
    我们全国工商业者对于美国及蒋介石卖国集团所加于我们的痛苦的历史教训，是深刻的，我们和全国人民一样，坚决反对美国的战争挑衅和停火诡计，任何恫吓讹诈，都不能动摇我们在共产党和人民政府领导下解放台湾的决心。我们全国工商业者誓愿贡献一切力量，反对国内外一切敌人，支援解放台湾的正义斗争，粉碎侵略者。
