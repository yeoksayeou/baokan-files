　　Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 3rd: According to the Vietnam News Agency, French colonial elements and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, in violation of the ceasefire agreement, mobilized troops on January 26th to loot the generator of the Haiphong Waterworks.
　　When residents went to stop them, their constabulary, police, and secret agents beat the masses with clubs and rifle butts, threw tear gas, and opened fire on the crowd. As a result, two people were killed, sixteen were injured, two truckloads of people were arrested, and two machines were stolen.
　　The people of Haiphong have sent numerous letters to the International Commission expressing their angry protests.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Washington, February 3rd: Since returning to Washington in late January, US Special Envoy to South Vietnam Collins has held a series of meetings with Eisenhower, Dulles, and senior officials of the US Department of Defense to discuss plans for further intervention and control of South Vietnam.
　　According to United Press correspondent in Washington, Hansley, the Washington authorities listened to Collins' report, in which he put forward a "seven-point plan" for intervention in South Vietnam. This plan, which attempts to deeply control South Vietnam in military, political, economic, and cultural aspects and to whitewash the Ngo Dinh Diem anti-people regime, includes: reorganizing the South Vietnamese puppet army, forcing the armies of various religious sects to submit to Ngo Dinh Diem; formulating plans to enslave Catholic residents forcibly relocated from North Vietnam; implementing sham land reform; establishing a puppet National Assembly; "reforming" finance; expanding the Ngo Dinh Diem government; and drafting an American-style cultural and educational program. According to Hansley, Collins' plan made a "deep impression" on Washington officials.
　　The reporter also revealed that the US authorities have decided to increase the number of US-equipped and trained South Vietnamese puppet troops to around 150,000, 50,000 to 60,000 more than originally planned, in order to strengthen the reactionary rule of South Vietnam and undermine the free general elections in Vietnam stipulated by the Geneva Conference.
　　The reporter admitted that the US intentions have aroused suspicion among the French. He pointed out that "the French fear that the United States will 'Americanize' South Vietnam and exclude all remaining French influence," and, moreover, "the French fear the economic consequences of this."
　　According to reports, Collins is about to return to Saigon to implement the US plan for intervention and control of South Vietnam. On January 30th, he made a statement on a television program. He admitted that the US investment in Vietnam was "risky," but he believed that "the risk is worth taking."

    越南海防人民抗议法方枪杀和逮捕居民
    柯林斯加紧在华盛顿策划美国控制南越的计划
    【新华社三日讯】据越南通讯社河内二日讯：破坏停战协定的法国殖民分子和吴庭艳集团在一月二十六日调动军队，抢劫海防自来水厂的发电机。
    当居民前往阻止的时候，他们的宪兵、警察和特务用棍棒、枪托殴击群众，投掷催泪弹，并且向群众开枪。结果，打死两人，打伤十六人，逮捕了两卡车的人，并且抢走了两部机器。
    海防人民已经送给国际委员会许多信件，表示愤怒的抗议。
    【新华社三日讯】华盛顿消息：美国驻南越特使柯林斯在一月下旬回到华盛顿以后，和艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯和美国国防部的高级官员们举行了一连串的会议，磋商进一步干涉和控制南越的计划。
    据合众社驻华盛顿记者汉斯莱透露，华盛顿当局听取了柯林斯的报告，他提出了干涉南越的“七点计划”。这个企图在军事、政治、经济、文化各方面深入控制南越并且粉饰吴庭艳反人民政权的计划，包括：整顿南越伪军，逼迫各教派军队归顺吴庭艳；订出奴役从北越强迫迁来的天主教居民的计划；实行假土地改革；成立伪国民议会；“改革”财政；扩大吴庭艳政府和拟订一个美国式的文化和教育的计划。据汉斯莱说，柯林斯的计划使华盛顿的官员“印象很深”。
    这个记者还透露，美国当局已经决定把美国装备和训练南越伪军的数字提高到十五万人左右，比原定的数字多五、六万人，以便加强南越的反动统治，破坏日内瓦会议规定的越南自由普选。
    这个记者承认美国的意图在法国人中间引起了疑虑。他指出：“法国人担心美国会使南越‘美国化’，并且排除一切剩余的法国影响”，而且，“法国人担心因此而引起的经济后果”。
    据消息说，柯林斯即将回西贡去执行美国干涉和控制南越的计划。一月三十日，他在电视节目上发表谈话。他承认美国在越南的投资是“冒险的”，但是他却认为“这个险是值得冒的”。
