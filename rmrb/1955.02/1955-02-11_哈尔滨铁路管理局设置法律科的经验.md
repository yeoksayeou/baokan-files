The state organs and important enterprises, in order to effectively and correctly implement the state's laws and decrees in specific operations, need to establish specialized legal work organizations to assist the leaders of the organs and enterprises in handling various tasks related to legal issues. The Soviet Union has long had experience in this area; some of our country's organs and enterprises are also doing this, and the Harbin Railway Bureau is one that has achieved remarkable results in this regard.

The Harbin Railway Bureau has a legal department, which was established in 1953 on the basis of the original Sino-Soviet Railway Administration Legal Department. It is an integral part of the Railway Bureau and a specialized organization for handling legal work issues. Its main tasks are to assist the Bureau Director in supervising and inspecting the correct implementation of the state's laws and decrees in railway enterprises; to review various regulations and orders drafted by the business units; to study and handle legal work issues raised by the business units; to represent the organs and enterprises in litigation in judicial organs; and to organize and compile various regulations, orders, resolutions, and other documents related to business. In addition to setting up the legal department as a specialized organization, the Harbin Railway Bureau also established legal advisors in its subordinate branch bureaus and the Business Office, Employee Living Supply Office, etc., to assist the leaders of the branch bureaus and offices in conducting relevant legal work under the guidance and connection of the legal department of the Bureau.

In the past two years, thanks to the attention of the leadership and the absorption of the working experience of the original Sino-Soviet Railway Legal Department, the legal work of the Harbin Railway Bureau has played a certain role in implementing the state's laws and decrees, educating employees to abide by the state's laws, improving the working style of the organs, and safeguarding the legitimate interests of railway enterprises.

In assisting the Bureau Director in reviewing orders, regulations, rules, instructions, and other documents drafted by the business units, according to statistics from the first half of 1953, the legal department and legal advisors reviewed 1,870 documents (including those from various branch bureaus), of which more than 1,100 were revised after they offered their opinions, accounting for more than 60% of the total number of documents issued. Only about 80 documents from the Bureau alone were deemed inappropriate after review and were not issued by the leadership. For example, in March 1954, a business department drafted an order on the organization of the Railway Physician Labor Appraisal Committee. After review, the legal department considered that replacing the functions of the Labor Insurance Committee and the Disability Review Committee with the Labor Appraisal Committee was inconsistent with the spirit of the state's labor laws regarding this issue. The leadership adopted this opinion and did not issue the order. Another example is when the legal department reviewed the "Methods for Reforming Signal Display and Signal Handling Methods in the Jurisdiction" (draft), it found that it contained a provision stating, "Before the new signals are announced, if the above instructions conflict with the current railway signal handling rules, the provisions of this instruction shall be temporarily followed." It was considered that this conflicted with the signal rules stipulated in the Ministry of Railways' technical management regulations, and it was revised after an opinion was offered. Since the issuance of various regulations, orders, instructions, and other documents of the Railway Bureau was subject to review by legal advisors in advance, some documents that should not be issued or could be issued or not were determined not to be issued, and some problems that could be solved by telephone or other means of communication were avoided as much as possible, thus, in the struggle against the bureaucratic style of writing documents in the organs, the work of the legal department and legal advisors also played a great role. Statistics show that the Bureau and its branch bureaus issued a total of 1,404 documents in the first half of 1954, a decrease of more than 24% compared with the same period in 1953, of which 275 documents were issued by the Bureau, a decrease of more than 32% compared with the documents issued by the Bureau in the same period in 1953. On the other hand, the quality of the documents has also improved compared with the past, and significant errors and contradictions in the documents have gradually been eliminated, making it easier for the lower levels to implement them. The reduction of the above-mentioned bureaucratic phenomenon and the improvement of the work of the organs are certainly due to the attention and supervision of the Party and government leaders of the Railway Bureau, but it is also obviously inseparable from the establishment of the legal department and the efforts of the legal workers. In order to further enhance the role of the legal department and legal workers in this regard, the Harbin Railway Bureau issued a special order on May 4 last year, instructing that the supervisory role of legal work over business units must be further strengthened in the future, and stipulating that documents drafted by business units must be reviewed by legal work organizations before being signed.

In safeguarding the legitimate interests of the national railway enterprises and the masses, the Bureau's legal department and the legal advisors of various branch bureaus have also played a great role. In terms of contract review, a total of 3,235 contracts, agreements, and covenants were reviewed in 1953, and a total of 8,978 were reviewed in 1954; the total amount of money involved was over 1 trillion yuan. All contracts that have been reviewed comply with the state's plans and basically ensure that both parties signing the contract fulfill their obligations, while contracts that do not comply with state laws and regulations are revised. The quality of the contracts has obviously improved. For example, the contract modification rate was about 85% in 1953, and it dropped to about 25% in 1954. In terms of supervising and inspecting tax revenue, the continuous key inspections by legal advisors have played a great role in ensuring national tax revenue. For example, during a spot check last year, it was discovered that a mere failure to affix stamps on basic construction contracts resulted in a tax evasion of 157.36 million yuan, which was later ordered to be paid retroactively. In terms of supervising and inspecting insurance, according to the results of a spot check in 1953, many units did not carry out insurance in accordance with state laws and regulations. The materials department alone underinsured 55.3 billion yuan of property insurance in the first half of the year, and the health department had more than 7 billion yuan of property without insurance. The Sunkeshu locomotive depot of the Harbin branch bureau of the locomotive department did not insure 40 locomotives and 1.7 billion yuan of materials. After the legal department made suggestions and these phenomena were corrected, the property damaged by disasters in the third quarter of 1953 was promptly compensated, with preliminary statistics reaching about 40 billion yuan. In 1954, various departments paid more attention to insurance, but after inspection by the legal department, it was still found that the Harbin Locomotive Depot and the Sunkeshu Locomotive Depot had 16 locomotives with property worth more than 32.3 billion yuan that were not insured, which were all corrected after they were pointed out. All these achievements were achieved in accordance with the intentions of the Bureau's leadership and in accordance with the principle of handling affairs according to law. Experience has proved that in order to ensure the legality of various business activities of enterprises, it is very necessary to establish and improve the legal department and make it a powerful assistant in implementing laws and regulations and inspecting work. In addition, in representing organs and enterprises in handling litigation cases, the legal advisors are specialized cadres engaged in legal work, they are more familiar with laws and regulations, and they are better able to objectively consider issues from a legal perspective. Therefore, they have also played a great role in protecting national interests and public property, safeguarding the legitimate interests of the masses, and educating railway employees to abide by the law.

In answering inquiries from various business departments of the Harbin Railway Bureau on legal issues, the legal department has also done a lot of work. In the past two years, the number of recorded legal issues answered by the legal department was 138 for the whole year of 1953, and it increased by more than 40% in 1954. Experience has proved that answering legal questions is a necessary way to instill legal knowledge and publicize law-abiding behavior to railway business units and the vast number of employees. This work is quite arduous, especially after the promulgation of the Constitution and several other important laws, the country's legal construction has entered a new period, and the legal department must be appropriately strengthened in order to do this work better.

    哈尔滨铁路管理局设置法律科的经验
    任建新
    国家机关和重要企业为着有效地使国家的法律法令在具体业务中正确贯彻，有必要设置法律工作的专门机构，以便协助机关、企业领导方面处理有关法律问题的各项工作。苏联在这方面早有经验；我国有些机关、企业也在这样做，哈尔滨铁路管理局就是在这方面做得已有显著成效的一个。
    哈尔滨铁路管理局设有一个法律科，是一九五三年在原中长铁路管理局法律处的基础上成立的。它是铁路管理局的一个组成部分，是处理有关法律工作问题的专门机构。它的主要任务是协助管理局长监督和检查国家的法律法令在铁路企业中的正确贯彻；审查各业务单位草拟的各种法规和命令；研究处理业务单位提出的有关法律工作的问题；代表机关、企业在司法机关进行诉讼；整理和编纂同业务有关的各种法规、命令、决议等文件。哈尔滨铁路管理局除设置了法律科这一专门机构以外，另在所属各分局和商务处、职工生活供应处等，设立了法律顾问，在管理局法律科的指导和联系下，协助各分局和各处领导方面分别进行有关法律的工作。
    两年来，哈尔滨铁路管理局的法律工作，由于领导重视，由于吸取了原中长铁路法律处的工作经验，对于贯彻国家法律法令，教育职工遵守国家法律，改进机关工作作风以及维护铁路企业的合法利益等方面，都起了一定的作用。
    在协助局长审查各业务单位起草命令、条例、规章、指示等文件方面，根据一九五三年上半年的统计，经过法律科和法律顾问审查的文件有一千八百七十件（包括各分局的），其中有一千一百多件是经过他们提出意见加以修改后才发布的，占发布文件总数的百分之六十以上。经审查后认为不适当而由领导方面决定不发布的，仅管理局的就约八十件。如一九五四年三月业务部门起草了一件关于组织铁路医师劳动鉴定委员会的命令，经法律科审查，认为以劳动鉴定委员会来代替劳动保险委员会和残废审查委员会的职权，是同国家劳动法令有关这个问题的规定的精神不符的。领导方面采纳了这一意见，没有发布这一命令。又如法律科在审查
  “管内各站改革信号显示办法及信号处理方法”
  （草案）的时候，发现内有“在新的信号未公布前，以上各项指示与现行的铁路信号处理规则抵触之处暂按本指示的规定办理”的规定，认为这同铁道部技术管理规程所规定的信号规则有所抵触，经提出意见，作了修改。由于铁路管理局的各项法规、命令、指示等文件的发布，事前经过法律顾问的审查，一些不应当发或者可发可不发的文件确定不发，一些可以改用电话或其他联络方式解决的问题尽量避免发文件，因此，在机关反对文牍主义作风的斗争中，法律科和法律顾问们的工作也起了很大作用。统计一九五四年上半年管理局和各分局共发布了一千四百零四件文件，比一九五三年同时期减少了百分之二十四强，其中属于管理局发布的文件为二百七十五件，比一九五三年同时期管理局发布的文件则减少了百分之三十二强。另一方面在文件的质量上较以前也有了提高，文件中显著的错误和相互矛盾的情况逐渐消除了，这样，下面也更容易执行了。上述文牍主义现象的减少和机关工作的改进，固然是由于铁路管理局党政领导方面注意督促检查，但显然也是同法律科的建立和法律工作人员的努力分不开的。为了进一步发挥法律科和法律工作者在这方面的作用，哈尔滨铁路管理局于去年五月四日专门发布了一个命令，指示今后必须进一步加强法律工作对业务单位的监督作用，并规定各业务单位草拟的文件在签署前必须经过法律工作机构的审查。
    在维护国家铁路企业和群众的合法利益方面，管理局法律科和各分局法律顾问也起了很大的作用。在审查合同方面，一九五三年审查各种合同、协议、契约等共计三千二百三十五份，一九五四年共计审查了八千九百七十八份；共计款数在一万亿元以上。凡是经过审查的合同，都符合国家的计划，并基本上保证了签订合同的双方履行了自己的义务，同时使那些不合国家法律、法令的合同，得到修正。合同的质量显然提高了，如一九五三年合同修改率为百分之八十五左右，到一九五四年即降低到百分之二十五左右。在监督检查税收方面，由于法律顾问不断进行重点检查，对保证国家税收起了很大的作用。如去年抽查时，即发现仅基本建设合同少贴印花一项即漏税一亿五千七百三十六万元，后令其补缴。在监督检查保险方面，根据一九五三年抽查结果，不少单位没有按国家法令规定进行保险，仅材料部门上半年的财产保险就少保了五百五十三亿元，卫生部门没有办理保险的财产达七十余亿元，机务部门哈尔滨分局三棵树机务段四十台机车和值十七亿元的材料都没有投保。这些现象经法律科提出建议得到纠正后，一九五三年第三季度遭受灾害的财产便得到及时补偿，据初步统计即达人民币约四百亿元。一九五四年各部门对保险已较重视，但经法律科检查后仍发现：哈尔滨机务段和三棵树机务段有十六台机车约计三百二十三亿元以上的财产没有投保，经提出后，都已纠正。所有这些工作成绩，都是根据管理局领导方面的意图，并按依法办事的原则取得的。经验证明：为保障企业各种业务活动的合法性，建立和健全法律科，并使之成为贯彻法令和检查工作的有力助手，是很有必要的。此外，在代表机关、企业进行诉讼案件的处理方面。由于法律顾问是专门进行法律工作的干部，他们比较熟悉法律法令，比较能够从法律的角度上客观地考虑问题，因而在保护国家利益和公共财产、维护群众的合法利益以及教育铁路职工守法等方面也起了很大的作用。
    在解答哈尔滨铁路管理局各业务部门有关法律问题的咨询方面，法律科也作了许多工作。两年来经过法律科解答的有关法律性的问题，有记录可查的，一九五三年全年为一百三十八件，一九五四年增加了百分之四十以上。经验证明：有关法律性问题的解答工作，是向铁路业务单位和广大职工灌输法律知识和宣传守法的一种必要的方式。这一工作是相当繁重的，特别在宪法和其他几个重要法律已经颁布之后，国家的法制建设已进入了新的时期，必须适当加强法律科，才能够把这项工作作得更好。
