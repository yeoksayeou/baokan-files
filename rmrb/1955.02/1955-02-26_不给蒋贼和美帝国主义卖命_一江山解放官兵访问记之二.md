Not Giving Their Lives for Chiang Kai-shek and American Imperialism
— A Reporter's Account of Visiting the Liberated Officers and Soldiers of Yijiangshan (Part Two)
By Our Correspondent Jin Feng

    At a little after 4:00 PM on January 18, 1955, the gunfire that liberated Yijiangshan Island ceased.

    Boat after boat of liberated Chiang Kai-shek soldiers and officers, following the path of the People's Liberation Army's advance, sailed towards the mainland. Soon after, they set foot on the soil of the mainland. Here, old cook Yu Changhua met his son Yu Baofa, who had been a messenger; ammunition soldier Jiang Yifu saw his younger brother Jiang Xiaoqing, who had been a cook; soldier Hou Annan found his wife Wang Cuimei; fishermen Xie Agou, Zheng Changgen, Xiang Atu, Jin Banggai... all ran into each other.

    Chen Meiyuan and Chen Guangyi, soldiers from Chiang Kai-shek's bandit Fourth Assault Brigade, who had been wounded, were sent to the hospital along with other wounded.

    Wang Fubi, the Brigade Commander of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit Fourth Assault Brigade, looked in a daze at his "subordinates" and the bustling streets. Not long before, he had been telling those soldiers that the "mainland was desolate and uninhabited."

    At this time, Taiwan Radio broadcast: "The 720 defending soldiers of Yijiangshan Island fought valiantly and all died heroically for their country."

    Five Hundred and Sixty-Four Living "Martyrs"

    In the list of "martyrs who died for their country" broadcast by Taiwan, the names of Wang Fubi, Chen Meiyuan, Chen Guangyi... appeared.

    When people told Wang Fubi that he had been listed as a "martyr who died for his country," he smiled faintly:
    "I knew long ago that Chiang Kai-shek would pull this trick to deceive his subordinates into dying for him."
    "But," he said thoughtfully, "I don't want my wife over there to be too sad about me."
    He walked to the recording machine and broadcast the news of his survival to Taiwan.

    Xiang Lianyuan, an operations officer from Chiang Kai-shek's bandit Fourth Assault Brigade, also smiled bitterly and said: "This is not surprising, we did this kind of thing over there. Two years ago, when we fought at Dalu and Xiaolu Islands, we had over two hundred casualties and dozens missing. As a result, regardless of whether they were alive or dead, they were all declared to have died heroically in battle, and a memorial service was held for them all."

    "I was also preparing for them to hold a memorial service for us," said Chen Dongnian, the political instructor of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit Fourth Artillery Company, as he sat down to write a letter to his colleagues left behind with Chiang Kai-shek: "You must have held a memorial service for me at the Zhongshan Hall. Let me tell you, this is just a trick you and I are already familiar with. Chiang Kai-shek is just rehashing old tunes this time, but he is blatantly spreading rumors more shamelessly and boldly. I think you will eventually understand that I am, after all, sitting here safe and sound writing to you, and over five hundred brothers are with me..."

    Chen Meiyuan, who had recovered from his injuries in the hospital, widened his eyes in surprise when he heard this: "What are you talking about! Am I not doing well here? I've lived to be forty-five years old, why are you cursing me to die for no reason! Bah, this is really seeing a ghost!" He spat on the ground and then began to talk about his capture.

    From six to eight o'clock on the morning of January 18, it was Chen Meiyuan's duty time. He stood on the hilltop, feeling a little cold. He kept stamping his feet and pacing back and forth on his post, impatiently waiting for someone to relieve him. He heard a series of whooshing sounds coming closer and closer, and the People's Liberation Army's planes had arrived over Yijiangshan. He hurriedly hid in the communication trench, but before he could curl up into a ball, bombs fell with a rumble, collapsing the communication trench and the guard shack, and dirt covered his head, burying Chen Meiyuan. After the planes bombed, the puppet squad leader came to look for him, but couldn't find him for three or forty minutes. A colleague, Wang Huaqing, saw a pair of hands wearing green gloves sticking out, and desperately dug away the soil with a shovel. Just as he dug to his thighs, the artillery from the mainland started firing again. In a daze, Chen Meiyuan only heard a flurry of frightened cries in his ears: "The artillery is firing again, the artillery is firing again." Wang Huaqing carried him to a semi-sheltered bunker. The sound of artillery shells exploding on the mountain was deafening. The soil from the bunker kept falling down. Someone looked out the door and saw many landing craft heading straight towards Yijiangshan from the north. "The reinforcements from Dachen are here," the puppet squad leader still wanted to boost everyone's morale.

    "How could the reinforcements from Dachen come from the north?" Chen Meiyuan wondered vaguely.

    Gunfire rang out outside the bunker, and it was Li Daoguo, a soldier from the same company as him, shouting: "Come out quickly, we will not kill those who surrender their weapons. The People's Liberation Army treats you leniently."

    Wang Huaqing carried him out of the bunker and then carried him onto the boat.

    That was it. He never expected that he and the other 563 officers and soldiers liberated in the Yijiangshan battle would be portrayed as "martyrs" by Taiwan radio. How ugly is the face of Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous clique!

    "Finally, the Day to Go Home!"

    The fisherman Zheng Changgen didn't understand what "dying heroically for one's country" meant. But when he understood that it meant "dying for Chiang Kai-shek," he couldn't help but feel angry.

    "That's like putting white powder on a skull face, shameless! We risked our lives several times to escape from there back to the mainland, how could we die for him!"

    He talked about his and his companions' several escape attempts.

    In February 1953, when the Spring Festival arrived, he had been captured on the island for ten months. Some of the fishermen who had been captured looked towards their hometown across the vast ocean from Shangdachen and secretly cried. During these ten months, the brave fishermen Xu Jingao and Mei Lin used two bamboo poles to float back to the mainland. Xie Agou and Wang Jinshui used bamboo poles and benches to drift in the ocean for two days and one night, but were caught again. One night after the Spring Festival, taking advantage of the darkness and the lack of a moon, Zheng Changgen and the others sneaked out while the opera was being performed in Aoli, Shangdachen. Wang Huaqing and Wang Naigou ran ahead and saw a small sampan by the sea. They hurriedly jumped on board and sailed away first. Zheng Changgen, Xie Agou, Wang Jinshui, Pan Deshun, and the others were a step slower, couldn't find a boat, and had to quietly fold back. They were caught during the bed check when they returned to the barracks and were scolded severely.

    In March 1953, Zheng Changgen, Jin Banggai, Li Shanbao, and Wang Yubao organized another escape. They had already spotted the small boat during the day and sneaked out again on a night when an opera was being performed. But, unexpectedly, a motor sailboat came along, constantly bumping into the small boat and making noise. The guards patrolled back and forth, constantly shining their flashlights. Zheng Changgen and the others squatted by the beach and waited, but the flashlight kept shining on the small boat. The time for the bed check arrived, and they had to run back again.

    More than a month later, on another rainy and foggy night, Wang Jinshui ran to the kitchen and winked at Xie Agou and Zheng Changgen. They understood. Xie Agou immediately ran out, followed by Zheng Changgen. Just as they slipped out of the barracks, they heard people calling their names from above. Zheng Changgen shrank back. Xie Agou and Wang Jinshui squatted in the communication trench all night and were caught the next day. They were beaten on the buttocks until they passed out.

    But they never lost heart.

    In the New Year of 1954, they were on Nanjii Island. On another rainy night, many of the guards on duty were gathered in the house gambling. Zheng Changgen, Xie Agou, Pan Deshun, Jiang Fusheng, and the others ran out again. The mooring rope of the small boat they had pre-selected was broken by the wind, and the small boat drifted far away in the sea. They waited and worked hard in the rain until dawn...

    What could stop their determination and desire to run back to the motherland and return to their hometown! The turbulent sea, the treacherous winds and waves, the layers of guards, the threat of being shot for desertion, could not make them resign themselves to staying on the island.

    One night in April 1954, Zheng Changgen was preparing to escape again. He and Jiang Fusheng were preparing to steal a sampan that was搁 on the shore. Xie Agou and Pan Deshun, who had been scheduled to go with them, were temporarily tied up and couldn't get out. Zheng Changgen persuaded a guard to escape with them. But they were discovered when they called for the fourth person. Zheng Changgen was locked in an air-raid shelter, given a bowl of saltwater and a bowl of thin congee a day...

    The defenses became even tighter, and they were watched every step of the way. They couldn't escape, and they looked forward to liberation day and night.

    The sound of artillery liberating Yijiangshan Island rang out, and they quickly dived into the air-raid shelter. The sound of gunfire from the People's Liberation Army's landing rang out, and they came out and happily handed over their weapons to the People's Liberation Army.

    "Finally, the day to go home!" They happily boarded the ship.

    Not Giving Their Lives for Chiang Kai-shek and American Imperialism

    Even among the middle and upper echelons of Chiang Kai-shek's army, few were determined to die.

    At 1:40 PM on January 18, the People's Liberation Army's landing craft was about to land on Yijiangshan Island. Xu Jingtian, the Director of the Political Office of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit Fourth Assault Brigade, gave an operations officer, Xiang Lianyuan, a pistol and instructed him:
    "Xiang Lianyuan, this is your chance to serve the country (meaning to give your life for Chiang Kai-shek). I hope you respect my orders, this pistol is for you to commit suicide."

    As soon as Xiang Lianyuan left the command post, the People's Liberation Army had landed from all directions. When he looked up the mountain again, it was full of People's Liberation Army soldiers. At this time, he jumped out of the air-raid shelter and raised his pistol. The pistol was fully loaded, and he could end his life with just a pull of the trigger. But who was he dying for, and why was he dying? He had been wandering on the island for four or five years, eating soybean cakes, wearing burlap sacks, and deceiving soldiers with talk of "counterattacking the mainland." But after shouting it for five years, he understood from his heart that it was just a lie. Pinning his hopes on "World War III" was even more illusory. He was just muddling through day by day over there. When it came down to it, was it worth dying for this future that had no future? His pistol fell to the ground.

    At the same time, in an air-raid shelter not far from him, the Brigade Commander of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit Fourth Assault Brigade, Wang Fubi, was also engaged in a struggle between life and death. In less than half a day, the defensive fortifications on Yijiangshan, which had been painstakingly built for three years under the direct command of the American military advisory group and the "Western Company," were destroyed one by one before his eyes. All the thatched houses on the island and the thatch on the mountains were on fire, and the sea was blackened by the fierce bombs. The sky was full of smoke and fire, and even the sunlight could not be seen. The steel-reinforced concrete fortifications collapsed, the air-raid shelters with several meters of thick accumulated soil collapsed, and the dense layers of secondary defensive fortifications were sometimes completely leveled. The People's Liberation Army's landing craft approached both Nanjiang and Beijiang simultaneously.

    The planes from Taiwan and the warships from Dachen couldn't even be seen.

    Just over a month ago, Chiang Kai-shek's Minister of Defense, Yu Dawei, and the Commander of the Dachen Defense Area, Liu Lianyi, had personally told Wang Fubi: "Yijiangshan will not be isolated and can receive support from the navy and air force at any time"...

    "They are completely lying!" Wang Fubi thought angrily: "Sending me to this damned place is just to die, to be their cannon fodder." His mind flashed quickly over Yu Dawei's pale and swollen face, behind him was the arrogant sneer of the fat American colonel from the American military advisory group inspecting the fortifications, and the sly smile of the "Western Company" representative and a mouthful of awkward Chinese: "For our common interests, Yijiangshan is an outpost of the free world..." Bah, what free world! Isn't it just for the struggle of a few in Chiang Kai-shek's clique! Isn't it just for the interests of the United States...

    His mind was in a chaotic mess, and the faces of Chiang Ching-kuo, Yu Dawei, Liu Lianyi, and the Americans were buzzing around in his head.

    "It's not worth dying for them!"

    Not dying, but afraid...

    Suddenly, a small leaflet burst out from these chaotic faces, and the clear words seemed to jump out: "With the exception of the bandit Chiang Kai-shek, anyone can receive lenient treatment by performing meritorious service to atone for their crimes, without any past misdeeds being held against them." This was a batch of leaflets dropped by the People's Liberation Army planes a few days ago.

    "Don't give your life for Chiang Kai-shek and the Americans!" He decided. He walked out and surrendered his weapons.

    不给蒋贼和美帝国主义卖命
    ——一江山解放官兵访问记之二
    本报记者　金凤
    一九五五年一月十八日下午四点多钟，解放一江山岛的枪炮声停止了。
    一船船被解放的蒋军官兵沿着解放军进军的道路，向着大陆的方向驶去。不久以后，他们踏到大陆的土地上。在这里，老伙夫余长华见到了他的当传令兵的儿子余保法；弹药兵江一夫看到了他的当伙夫的弟弟江小青；士兵侯安南找到了他的妻子王粹媚；渔民谢阿狗、郑长根、项阿土、金邦盖……都碰到一起了。
    负了伤的蒋贼突击第四大队士兵陈美圆和陈光益，随着其他伤员一起被送进医院。
    蒋贼突击第四大队的大队长王辅弼，在迷茫地看着他的“部下”和热闹的街市。不久以前，他还和那些士兵讲过“大陆上荒无人烟”。
    这时候台湾广播：“一江山岛守军七百二十名流血奋战，全部壮烈殉国。”
    五百六十四个活“烈士”
    在台湾广播的“死难烈士”的名单里，出现着王辅弼、陈美圆、陈光益……的名字。
    当人们告诉王辅弼他已被列为“死难烈士”的时候，他淡淡地一笑：
      “我早知道蒋介石要来这一手，来欺骗他的部下给他送死。”
      “但是，”他沉思着说：“我可不愿意我留在那边的妻子为我过份伤心。”
    他走向录音机旁，向台湾广播了他的生存消息。
    蒋贼突击第四大队作战军官相廉远也苦笑着说：“这不足为奇，我们在那边就搞过这一套。前年打大、小鹿山，伤亡二百多，失踪好几十。结果不管活的死的，一律宣布突击阵亡，一起开了个追悼会。”
    “我还准备着他们来追悼我们哩。”蒋贼炮兵第四中队指导员陈东年说着坐下来，给他留在蒋贼那边的同事写了一封信：“你们想必在中山堂开追悼大会追悼我了罢。告诉你，这不过是你我早已熟悉的骗局。蒋介石这一次也是老调翻新，不过公然造谣得更无耻、更大胆罢了。我想你终究会明白我毕竟是好端端的坐在这里给你写信，五百多名弟兄都和我在一起……”
    在医院里已经养好了伤的陈美圆听了这话，却惊奇得睁大了眼：“这是哪里说起！我不是好好的待在这里？我活了四十五岁，怎么平白无故的咒我死！呸，这真是活见鬼！”他向地下啐了一口，接着讲起了他的被俘经过。
      一月十八日早晨六点到八点，正是陈美圆的值岗时间。他站在山头上，冷得有点发抖。他不住地跺着脚在岗位上走来走去，不耐烦地等待着别人来接岗。只听得一阵阵呜呜的声音由远而近，解放军的飞机已经到了一江山的上空。他赶忙躲进交通沟，还来不及把身子缩成一团，炸弹轰隆隆地落了下来，把交通沟和卫兵棚都炸塌了，泥土兜头兜脑地盖下来，把陈美圆埋了起来。飞机炸过以后，伪班长来找他，找了三四十分钟没有找见。有一个同事王化庆看到一双戴着绿手套的手露在外面，才拚命用铁锹把土掘开。刚掘到他大腿的时候，头门的大炮又打过来了。在昏迷中的陈美圆只听到耳边一片惊惶的叫声：“又打炮了，又打炮了。”他被王化庆背到一个半隐蔽部。满山的炮弹炸裂声响成一片。隐蔽部的泥土簌簌地直掉下来。有人到门口一看，只见北面许多登陆艇直向着一江山开来。“是大陈增援部队来了。”伪班长还想鼓励大家的士气。
    “大陈增援部队怎么会从北面开来呢？”陈美圆迷迷糊糊地想。
    隐蔽部外枪声响了起来，是和他同一个中队的士兵李道锅的声音在叫：“快出来吧，缴枪不杀，解放军宽待你们。”
    王化庆背着他出了隐蔽部，又驮着他下了船。
    就是这样。他从来也没有料想到他和其他的在一江山战斗中解放过来的五百六十三名官兵会被台湾的广播打扮成为“烈士”。蒋介石卖国集团的嘴脸是多么丑恶啊！
    “可盼到了回家的日子！”
    渔民郑长根不懂得什么叫“壮烈殉国”。但他在明白了这就是“替蒋介石送死”的意思时，他禁不住气愤起来。
    “这就是骷髅脸上贴白粉，死不要脸！我们几次三番豁出性命想从那里逃回大陆，怎么会为他送死！”
    他谈起了他和他的同伴几次偷逃的经过。
    一九五三年二月，春节来到的时候，他被抓到海岛已经有十个月光景。他们一些被抓去的渔民，在上大陈隔着茫茫的海洋望着家乡的方向偷偷的哭。在这十个月中，勇敢的渔民徐金高和梅林用两根毛竹氽回大陆去了。谢阿狗和王金水用毛竹和板凳在海洋里漂了两天一夜，又被抓了回来。春节以后的一天晚上，乘着天黑没有月亮，上大陈岙里在做戏，郑长根他们偷跑了出来。王华庆、王乃狗两个跑在最前头，看到海边有只小舢舨，慌慌张张跳上去先开走了。郑长根、谢阿狗、王金水、潘德顺他们跑慢了一步，再也找不到船，只得悄悄折了回来。回营房正赶上查铺，把他们臭骂了一顿。
      一九五三年的三月，郑长根、金邦盖、李善宝和王玉宝他们又组织逃跑，小船是白天早就看好了的，乘着又是做戏的晚上溜了出来。但是，料不到开来一只机帆船，时时和小船撞击着发出声响，看守的卫兵走来走去用电筒不住地照射着。郑长根他们蹲在海滩边等待，电筒光老是在小船上闪耀。查铺的时间到了，他们又只得跑回来。
    一个多月以后，又是一个下雨有雾的晚上。王金水跑到伙房，朝谢阿狗和郑长根?了一?眼睛。他们明白了。谢阿狗马上跑了出去，郑长根接着跟了出去。刚溜出营房，只听得上面一片声叫着他们的名字。郑长根缩转回来。谢阿狗和王金水在交通沟蹲了一夜，第二天被抓回来打了一顿屁股，打得昏死过去。
    但是他们绝没有灰心。
    一九五四年的新年，他们到了南麂。又是一个下雨的晚上，许多值班卫兵都聚在屋里赌钱。郑长根、谢阿狗、潘德顺、蒋复生他们又跑了出去。预先看定的小船的缆绳被风吹断了，小船远远地漂在海中央，他们在雨中等待着，忙碌着，一直到天明……
    有什么能挡住他们想跑回祖国，跑回家乡的决心和愿望啊！波涛滚滚的大海，险恶的风浪，层层的卫兵，开小差抓回来要枪毙之类的威胁，都不能使他们死心踏地留在海岛。
    一九五四年四月的一个晚上，郑长根又准备逃跑。他和蒋复生准备去偷一条搁在岸上的舢舨，约好了的谢阿狗和潘德顺临时被绊住，跑不出来。郑长根说动了一个看守的卫兵，准备一起逃跑。但在叫第四个人的时候被发觉了。郑长根被关进防空洞，一天一碗盐水，一碗稀饭……
    防守更加严密起来，他们走一步路都有人监视着。他们逃不出来，他们日夜盼望着解放。
    解放一江山的炮声响了，他们赶紧钻进防空洞去。解放军登陆的枪声响了，他们走了出来，高高兴兴地把枪交给解放军。
      “可盼到了回家的日子了。”他们欢天喜地走上船去。
    不给蒋贼和美帝国主义卖命
    就是在蒋贼军的中上层分子中，也很少有人决心送死。
      一月十八日的下午一时四十分，解放军的登陆艇快要在一江山登陆了。蒋贼突击第四大队政治室主任徐九天给作战军官相廉远一枝手枪，对他交代说：
      “相廉远，这是你报国（意指为蒋贼卖命）的机会到了。希望你尊重我的命令，这支手枪是给你自杀用的。”
    相廉远刚离开指挥所，解放军已经四面八方登陆了。他再往山上一看，满山都是解放军。这时，他跳下防空洞举起了手枪。手枪的子弹上满了膛，只要一扳枪机，他就可以了结自己的生命。但是自己究竟为谁而死，又为什么而死呢？他流浪到海岛上四、五年了，吃过豆饼，披过麻袋，也欺骗过士兵“反攻大陆”。但是叫了五年，自己从心里明白这不过是骗人的鬼话。把希望寄托在“第三次世界大战”更是渺茫。他在那边也只是混一天算一天罢了。事到临头，难道值得为这没有前途的前途送死吗？他的手枪落到了地下。
    同一个时候，在离他不远的一个防空洞内，蒋贼突击第四大队大队长王辅弼的头脑中也在展开着生和死的斗争。在不到半天的时间中，三年来在美国军事顾问团和“西方公司”直接指挥下苦心经营的一江山防御工事，一一在他面前摧毁了。岛上所有的草房和山上的茅草都着了火，海水被猛烈的炸弹烧得发黑。满天烟火，连日光也看不见。钢骨水泥的工事倒塌了，好几公尺厚积土的防空洞震垮了，密密层层的副防御工事有些被炸得一塌平了。解放军的登陆艇向南江、北江同时逼近。
    台湾的飞机、大陈的兵舰连影子也看不到。
    仅仅一个多月以前，蒋贼国防部长俞大维和大陈防卫地区司令刘濂一亲口对王辅弼讲过：“一江山不会孤立，随时都可以得到海空军的支援”……
    “他们完全是骗人！”王辅弼愤愤地想：“调我到这该死的地方就是来送死，来给他们当炮灰。”他脑中飞快地掠过俞大维那苍白浮肿的脸，在他后面的是美国军事顾问团那肥胖上校巡查工事时的傲慢的冷笑，还有“西方公司”代表那狐狸似的狡猾的笑容和一口生硬的中国话：“为了我们共同的利益，一江山是自由世界的前哨……”呸，什么自由世界！还不是为了蒋介石少数人的挣扎！还不是为了美国的利益……
    他脑中乱哄哄地想着，蒋经国、俞大维、刘濂一、美国人的面影不住地在他的头脑中嗡嗡地旋转着。
      “为他们死，不值得！”
    不死，又怕……
    突然，一张小小的传单从这些纷杂的面影中奔迸出来，那鲜明的字句仿佛在跳跃出来：“除蒋贼一人而外，任何人都可以受到立功赎罪、既往不究的宽大待遇。”这是几天以前从解放军飞机上散下来的一批传单。
      “不给蒋介石和美国人卖命！”他决定了。他走了出来，他交出了武器。
