Xinhua News Agency, New York, 16th. According to TASS: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on the 14th.

    The meeting first reviewed the preliminary agenda. The items listed on the agenda were: the issue of the United States' acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan and other island regions of China, proposed by the Soviet delegation, and the issue of "hostile actions in certain island regions along the mainland coast of China" proposed by New Zealand. The purpose of New Zealand's proposal is obviously to cover up the United States' blatant interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China.
    Soviet Representative Sobolev voted against including the New Zealand proposal on the preliminary agenda. In explaining the reasons for his vote, he pointed out that the proposal deliberately failed to mention the root causes of the deterioration of the situation in the Far East and the creation of a threat of war. It only suggested a ceasefire in a small group of island regions off the coast of China, while the Security Council should consider the most important issue, which is the elimination of the root causes of tension in the Far East.
    The New Zealand proposal was included in the agenda by a vote of nine to one (Soviet Union), with one abstention (the Kuomintang element). The Soviet proposal was included in the agenda with ten votes in favor and one abstention (the Kuomintang element).
    After the adoption of the agenda, New Zealand Representative Munro spoke first, expressing "deep regret" that the Government of the People's Republic of China had refused to participate in the discussion on the New Zealand proposal. He did not mention that the People's Republic of China had not refused to participate in the discussion on the issue of eliminating tensions in Taiwan and other island regions of China, and that it had expressed its willingness to participate in the discussion of the project proposed by the Soviet delegation, which aims to eliminate the real root causes of tension in the Taiwan region, after obtaining its legitimate seat in the Security Council.
    U.S. Representative Lodge expressed "disappointment" at the reply of the People's Republic of China. He tried to describe the United States' acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China as "defensive" and the New Zealand proposal as "for peace."
    British Representative Dixon said that Britain supported the New Zealand proposal, which, according to him, opened up reasonable and conciliatory prospects for ending hostilities in the coastal island regions of China. Dixon expressed "regret" over the reply of the Government of the People's Republic of China, saying that Britain was consulting with other countries and was willing to study any reasonable proposal to resolve the issue. He said that the Security Council should not take further action on the New Zealand proposal, and the purpose of this meeting was to discuss the reply of the People's Republic of China. The British representative moved that the Security Council should suspend the discussion of the New Zealand proposal while keeping it on the Security Council's agenda.
    The French representative supported Dixon's motion. He said that the Security Council could not ignore the situation in the coastal island regions of China. He expressed satisfaction with the "withdrawal" of Chiang Kai-shek's troops from some Chinese islands, saying that the involvement of U.S. armed forces in this "retreat" was "reasonable," although everyone knew that the actions of the U.S. fleet constituted interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China. The French representative agreed to keep the New Zealand proposal on the Security Council's agenda, but he expressed the hope that other methods, namely "traditional diplomatic negotiations," should also be used to resolve the issues of Taiwan and other Chinese islands.
    Soviet Representative Sobolev, in his speech, exposed the purpose and substance of the New Zealand proposal and explained the reasons for the People's Republic of China's refusal to participate in the Security Council's discussion on this issue. Sobolev analyzed the root causes of international tension in the Taiwan and other island regions of China, pointing out that these root causes lie in the United States' acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China. Sobolev said that unless the Security Council boldly takes measures to stop the United States' interference in China's internal affairs and corrects the shameful injustice towards the People's Republic of China (which is still being deprived of its legitimate seat in the United Nations), it will not be possible to ease tensions in the Far East and eliminate the threat to international peace and security in that region.
    In view of the fact that the New Zealand proposal does not reflect the true situation in the Far East and its purpose is only to cover up the root causes of international tension in the Taiwan and other island regions of China, the Soviet representative moved that the Security Council discuss the second item on the agenda: "Acts of aggression by the United States of America against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan and other island regions of China." Sobolev emphasized that the discussion of this Soviet proposal would make it possible to take appropriate measures to eliminate the root causes of the threat of war in the Far East. The Soviet representative said that if the Security Council postpones the discussion of the proposal on this issue, it will in fact render the Security Council inactive.
    U.S. Representative Lodge, in his speech, tried his best to deny it, insisting that the Soviet representative's entire speech was common propaganda.
    After Lodge's speech, Security Council President Bélande used various procedural tricks, insisting that the purpose of the Soviet motion to discuss the issue raised by the Soviet delegation was to amend the original decision to discuss the New Zealand proposal first.
    In his reply, Soviet Representative Sobolev emphasized that he was not asking to amend the Security Council's decision to discuss the New Zealand proposal first. Sobolev said that the Soviet delegation hoped to begin discussing the item it had proposed, because the speeches of the Western representatives indicated that the discussion on the New Zealand proposal had ended. Sobolev emphasized that we have pointed out long ago that the discussion of the New Zealand proposal cannot lead to the elimination of tensions in the Far East, because this proposal does not touch on the real root causes of tension in the Far East. Some people are trying to force the Security Council to do nothing. We cannot tolerate this situation. The purpose of the Soviet proposal is to take concrete decisions and measures to ensure the normalization of the situation in the Far East.
    The New Zealand representative hurried to say that the discussion on the item proposed by his delegation had not ended, and therefore it was impossible to discuss the Soviet proposal.
    On this point, Sobolev reiterated that the New Zealand representative was actually suggesting that the Security Council continue to do nothing. And inaction itself cannot solve an important problem. Sobolev firmly demanded that the Security Council discuss the next item on the agenda: the issue of the United States' acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan and other island regions of China. The Soviet representative requested that his motion be put to a vote.
    The majority of the Council, led by the U.S. and British delegations, rejected Sobolev's request to discuss the Soviet proposal on the issue of U.S. aggression against the People's Republic of China.
    The Security Council then adjourned.

    安理会十四日会议竟拒绝讨论苏联建议
    苏联代表指责美国对中国的侵略
    并指出新西兰建议掩饰了国际紧张局势的根源
    【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国安全理事会十四日举行会议。
    会议首先审议会议的初步议程。列在议程上的项目有：苏联代表团提出的美国在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为问题，新西兰提出的“在中国大陆沿岸某些岛屿地区的敌对行动”问题。新西兰的这个建议的目的显然是要掩盖美国对中华人民共和国的内政的粗暴的干涉。
    苏联代表索波列夫投票反对把新西兰的建议列入初步议程。他在解释他投票的理由时指出，这个建议故意不提到使远东局势恶化和造成战争威胁的根源。它只建议在中国沿海的一小群岛屿地区停火，而安全理事会却应该考虑最重要的问题，就是消除远东紧张局势的根源的问题。
    新西兰的建议以九票对一票（苏联）、一票弃权（国民党分子）被列入议程。苏联的建议以十票赞成被列入议程，一票弃权（国民党分子）。
    在通过议程后，新西兰代表孟罗首先发言，他对中华人民共和国政府拒绝参加关于新西兰建议的讨论表示“深感遗憾”。他没有提到，中华人民共和国并没有拒绝参加关于消除中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区的紧张局势问题的讨论，它并且表示愿意在得到它在安全理事会中的合法地位以后，参加苏联代表团提出的、目的在于消除台湾地区紧张局势的真正根源的项目的讨论。
    美国代表洛奇对中华人民共和国的答复表示
  “失望”。他力图把美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为说成是“防御性的”，把新西兰建议说成是“为了和平的”。
    英国代表狄克逊说，英国支持新西兰建议，据他说，新西兰建议为结束中国沿海岛屿地区的敌对行动打开了合理的和和解的前景。狄克逊对中华人民共和国政府的答复表示“遗憾”，他说，英国正在同其他国家进行磋商，而且愿意研究解决这个问题的任何合理的建议。他说，安全理事会不应当对新西兰建议采取进一步的措施，这次会议的目的是讨论中华人民共和国的答复。英国代表动议，安全理事会应当暂停讨论新西兰建议，而把它留在安全理事会议程上。
    法国代表支持狄克逊的动议。他说，安全理事会不能够忽视中国沿海岛屿地区的局势。他对蒋介石军队“撤出”一些中国岛屿表示满意，据他说美国武装力量参与这次“撤退”是“合理的”，虽然大家知道，美国舰队的行动构成了对中华人民共和国内政的干涉。法国代表同意把新西兰建议留在安全理事会议程上，但是，他表示希望还应当利用其他办法，即“传统的外交谈判”来解决台湾和中国其他岛屿问题。
    苏联代表索波列夫在会上发言时揭露了新西兰建议的目的和实质，并且说明了中华人民共和国拒绝参加安全理事会关于这个问题的讨论的原因。索波列夫分析了中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区的国际紧张局势的根源，指出这些根源就在于美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为。索波列夫说，要是安全理事会不大胆地采取措施，制止美国对中国内政的干涉，并且纠正对待中华人民共和国的可耻的不公正态度（中华人民共和国仍然被剥夺在联合国中的合法席位），就不可能缓和远东紧张局势和消除对那个地区的国际和平和安全的威胁。
    鉴于新西兰建议并不能反映远东的真实情况，它的目的只是要掩饰在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区的国际紧张局势的根源，苏联代表动议安全理事会讨论议程上的第二个项目：“关于美利坚合众国在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为”。索波列夫强调指出，讨论苏联的这个建议，就有可能采取适当措施，来消除在远东造成战争威胁的根源。苏联代表说，要是安全理事会延期讨论关于这一问题的建议，事实上会使安全理事会无所作为。
    美国代表洛奇在发言中竭力进行抵赖，硬说苏联代表的全部发言是常见的宣传。
    在洛奇发言后，安全理事会主席贝朗德施用了种种程序上的诡计，硬说苏联关于讨论苏联代表团提出的问题的动议的目的是要修改原先关于先讨论新西兰建议的决定。
    苏联代表索波列夫在回答时着重指出，他并没有要求修改安全理事会关于先讨论新西兰建议的决定。索波列夫说，苏联代表团希望开始讨论它所提出的项目，因为西方代表的发言表明，对新西兰提出的项目的讨论已经完结。索波列夫着重说，我们早已指出，对新西兰建议的讨论不可能导致远东紧张局势的消除，因为这个建议并没有触及远东紧张局势的真正根源。有人正在试图迫使安全理事会无所作为。要我们接受这种情况，我们是无法容忍的。苏联建议的目的是采取具体的决定和措施来保证使得远东局势正常化。
    新西兰代表赶忙起来说，对它的代表团提出的项目的讨论还没有完结，因此讨论苏联的建议是不可能的。
    关于这一点，索波列夫再度着重指出，新西兰代表实际上是建议安全理事会继续无所作为。而无所作为本身是无法解决一个重要的问题的。索波列夫坚决要求安全理事会讨论议程上的下一项目：美国在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为问题。苏联代表要求把他的动议提付表决。
    以美国和英国代表团为首的理事会中的多数拒绝了索波列夫要求讨论苏联提出的关于美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为问题的动议。
    安全理事会于是休会。
