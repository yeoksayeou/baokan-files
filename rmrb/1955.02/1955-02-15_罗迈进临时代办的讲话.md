Comrade Chairman, dear comrades and friends!

    I congratulate you on the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance between the Soviet Socialist Republics and the People's Republic of China.

    The treaty signed five years ago was an event of great significance in the lives of the people of the Soviet Union and China and in the history of international relations.

    The unbreakable fraternal friendship that unites the people of our two countries is now enshrined in this treaty.

    Looking back on the road our two countries have traveled in the past five years, we can see how fruitful our cooperation has been. The Soviet people, implementing the wise decisions of their party and government, have achieved great success in building a communist society. The 600 million Chinese people, who have obtained their own regime, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Republic of China, are victoriously resolving the grand plans for national industrialization, comprehensively improving the entire national economy, and improving the living standard of the working people . The people of the Soviet Union are proud of the achievements of their great neighbor and friend, and wish it further prosperity.

    Looking back on the past, we also see that thanks to the joint efforts of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, international tensions have eased, and the advocates of the "strength" policy have suffered defeats, and it can be predicted that they will suffer defeats even more frequently in the future. All this means that the experience of the past five years has convincingly proved that the cooperation established between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China has great vitality, and this cooperation is a reliable bulwark of peace and security in the Far East and an important factor in safeguarding the cause of international peace.

    But we must not forget that the enemies of peace and progress are trying to ignite the flames of a new war. They are trying to restore all the countries that have escaped the shackles of capitalism to the regime of bank bosses. The recent provocations by American imperialists in Taiwan and other island regions of China, as well as the occupation of Taiwan itself, particularly illustrate this point. But they will not succeed. Millions of progressive people are vigilantly defending peace.

    May the peace, democracy and socialism camp headed by the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China continue to consolidate and grow stronger forever, and may the enemy tremble before this camp!

    We advocate easing international tensions and defending the cause of peace. But as Comrade Molotov said: "...The kind of easing of international tensions that we are talking about cannot be achieved by destroying or dividing the freedom and national rights of a certain country or nation, but by guaranteeing and striving to strengthen these democratic rights. The interests of progress in the lives of all countries and nations require this."

    The Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, together with all the People's Democratic countries that make up the camp of peace, democracy and socialism, are unyieldingly defending peace and the great fruits of victory they have won in their arduous struggle against enemies at home and abroad.
    On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Soviet-Chinese Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, the Soviet people express their best wishes to the Chinese people in their cause of building a happy new life and in their struggle for peace and security among all nations.

    Glory to the Communist Parties and Governments of the USSR and China!
    Long live the eternal friendship and mutual assistance between the people of the Soviet Union and China!

    Please raise your glasses to the health and further prosperity of the great Chinese people,

    To the health and further success of the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Government,
    To the health of Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

### 罗迈进临时代办的讲话

    罗迈进临时代办的讲话主席同志亲爱的同志们、朋友们！
    我向你们祝贺苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟和中华人民共和国之间友好同盟互助条约签订五周年纪念。
    这个五年前所签订的条约乃是苏中两国人民生活中和国际关系史上的一件有重大意义的事件。
    现在把我们两国人民团结在一起的牢不可破的兄弟友谊的基础就是在这个条约里固定下来的。
    回顾一下我们两国过去五年来所经历的道路，我们就会看到我们的合作是多么富有成果。苏联人民实现着自己的党和政府的英明决定，在建设共产主义社会的事业上，获得了巨大的成就。取得了自己政权的六亿中国人民在共产党和中华人民共和国人民政府领导下，正在胜利地解决着国家工业化，全面提高全部国民经济和改善劳动人民生活水平方面的宏大计划。苏联人民对于自己的伟大的邻邦和朋友的成就而引以自豪，并且预祝它获得进一步的繁荣。
    回顾一下过去，我们也看到，由于苏联和中华人民共和国的共同努力，国际紧张局势有了缓和，而“实力”政策的拥护者已经遭受了失败，并且可以预料今后将会更加频繁地遭受失败。这一切都意味着：过去五年的经验令人信服地证明了苏联和中华人民共和国之间业已建立起来的合作是具有伟大的生命力的，这种合作乃是远东和平和安全的可靠堡垒，并且是维护国际和平事业的一个重要的因素。
    但是不能忘记：和平和进步的敌人企图燃烧起新战争的火焰。他们企图把一切已经脱离了资本主义枷锁的国家再回复到银行老板的政权之下。美帝国主义者最近在台湾和中国其他岛屿地区所进行的挑衅以及侵占台湾这件事情本身特别说明了这一点。但是他们是不会成功的。千百万的进步人士警惕地保卫着和平。
    愿以苏联和中华人民共和国为首的和平民主社会主义阵营不断巩固和永远壮大，让敌人在这个阵营面前发抖吧！
    我们主张缓和国际紧张局势，并且保卫和平事业。但是正像莫洛托夫同志所说的：“……我们所说的那种缓和国际紧张局势，是不能靠破坏或是分割某个国家、某个民族的自由和民族权利而求得的，而是在保障和尽力加强这些民主权利的情况下求得的，各国、各民族生活中的进步的利益正是要求这样”。
    苏联和中华人民共和国同所有的组成和平民主社会主义阵营的人民民主国家在一起，不屈不挠地保卫着和平以及他们在对国内外敌人进行顽强斗争中所获得的伟大的胜利果实。
    在苏中友好同盟互助条约签订五周年纪念日，苏联人民向中国人民在建设幸福的新生活的事业上，在争取各国人民之间和平和安全的斗争中，表示最良好的愿望。
    光荣归于苏联和中国的共产党和政府！
    苏中两国人民之间永恒友谊和互助万岁！
    请诸位为伟大中国人民的健康和进一步繁荣，
    为中国共产党和中国政府领导者们的健康和他们进一步的成功，
    为中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志的健康干杯！
