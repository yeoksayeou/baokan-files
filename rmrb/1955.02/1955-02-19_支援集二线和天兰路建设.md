    To support the construction of the new railway lines, the Harbin Railway Administration has transferred 173 employees to the Jining-Erlian Railway and the Tianshui-Lanzhou Railway. This group includes branch bureau chiefs, section chiefs, department heads, station and section chiefs, chief accountants, drivers, fitters, and other personnel. They are all excellent cadres and employees who have diligently studied the experience of the Changchun-Dalian Railway.
    Before their departure, the Harbin Railway Administration, the Political Department, and the Harbin District Committee of the China Railway Trade Union jointly held a send-off meeting for the employees going to the new lines. Tan Puzhi, a representative of the employees going to the new lines, stated: In the future, in the new work posts, under the leadership of the Party and in close unity and cooperation with the local employees, we will overcome all difficulties, resolutely fulfill the national transportation tasks, and support the liberation of Taiwan.
