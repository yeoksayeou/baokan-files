Actively Eliminate Overwintering Rice Borers

The Yancheng County Farm in Jiangsu Province recently conducted an in-depth inspection of the fields and discovered that the mortality rate of overwintering rice borers was very low. It immediately mobilized all staff to actively eliminate overwintering rice borers. Within six days, all the rice roots in the farm's more than 180 mu of wheat fields were removed, basically eliminating the rice borers in the wheat fields. As a result, surrounding farmers were motivated to carry out rice borer control work in a timely manner. Agricultural production cooperatives such as Qinglong, Gangdong, and Donghe are now intensively engaged in the removal and burning of rice roots. (Our Jiangsu Correspondent)

    积极消灭越冬螟虫
    江苏省盐城县农场最近深入田间检查，发现越冬螟虫死亡率很低，立即发动全场职工积极消灭越冬螟虫。在六天之内，就把全场一百八十多亩麦田里的稻根全部除清，基本上消灭麦田螟虫。因此，带动了周围农民及时开展治螟工作。青龙、岗东、东河等农业生产合作社正紧张进行除治和烧毁稻根工作。（本报江苏记者站）
