Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 15th. "Pravda" published an article by V. Mayevsky commenting on the results of the recently held Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference.

Mayevski wrote: The British Conservative government's policies have become particularly aggressive in the past seven or eight months. Britain is one of the initiators of the London and Paris Agreements. The British ruling clique has strived to support the preparations for an atomic war against peace-loving peoples, thereby once again confirming their agreement to turn Britain into an "aircraft carrier of American atomic bomb planes." Together with the United States, Britain actively participated in the establishment of aggressive war blocs in Southeast Asia and is supporting the United States' aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China.

However, this cooperation between the US and British governments has not eliminated the differences between the two countries. On the contrary, in the process of this cooperation, not only have the differences between the US and Britain become increasingly acute, but also the internal divisions within the Commonwealth itself have become increasingly acute.

Under these circumstances, the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, which closed in London a few days ago, was required to support British policy and unite the Commonwealth to fight for the interests of British monopoly capital.

Mayevski quoted newspaper reports saying that the conference revolved around the issue of "regional defense," or more precisely, around Britain's war preparations in Europe and Asia.

During the conference, Conservative government leaders Churchill and Eden revealed themselves to be enthusiastic defenders of the aggressive North Atlantic bloc.

Mayevski continued: The obligations undertaken by Britain under the Paris Agreements to station a large number of armed forces in Europe—which are related to war preparations against peace-loving peoples—require the support of the Commonwealth. This has created a situation that those enthusiastic about strengthening the British Empire have always worried about. The increase in Britain's military obligations in Europe means an increased burden on the dominions and an increase in their financial difficulties, which ultimately means the weakening of the Commonwealth's ties. All of this will provide new opportunities for the United States to increase its pressure on the British Empire.

Churchill will not receive the support of all Commonwealth countries for the main item of his "new strategic" plan – the policy of reviving the West German "Defense Force".

The significant revision of Britain's "strategy" in Europe is closely related to Britain's new plans in the Arab East and Southeast Asia, which also require the support of Commonwealth countries.

Anglo-American contradictions are the real reason for Britain's "strategy" in the Arab East, although, needless to say, on certain issues, the aggressive intentions of British and American imperialism are consistent in that region.

The same is true of Britain's new plans in Southeast Asia and the Far East.

It can be confirmed from foreign newspaper reports that Britain is attempting to use the London Conference to strengthen its concerted actions with Australia, New Zealand, and Pakistan within the scope of the Southeast Asian war bloc (Southeast Asia Treaty Organization).

Britain's efforts to win the support of the British Empire members of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization appear to be an attempt to strengthen its position at the upcoming Bangkok meeting of the group.

However, the struggle to win dominance within the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization has not distracted Britain from its main task in the region, which is to expand the colonial war in Malaya. It is no accident that Britain demanded at the London Conference that Australia and New Zealand send more troops to Malaya.

In the struggle to expand the suppression of the national liberation movement of the Asian people, the British Conservatives, as they usually do in such cases, intensified their so-called peaceful aims. They put forward the deceptive slogan of a "ceasefire" in the area of the China Sea.

The Conservative government's new efforts to strengthen Britain's imperial position and to have the Commonwealth countries support the aggressive plans of British imperialism have not achieved the expected goals. This policy built on war blocs has not only failed to restrain the centrifugal forces within the British Empire but has further strengthened them. At the same time, it may further sharpen Anglo-American contradictions; as can be seen from American newspaper reports, the United States is doubting Britain's desire to strengthen its influence in Europe and Asia. The further deepening of disagreements within aggressive war blocs is inevitable.

### “真理报”载文评论英联邦总理会议的结果

   “真理报”载文评论英联邦总理会议的结果
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十五日电：“真理报”发表了维·马耶夫斯基评论最近举行的英联邦总理会议结果的一篇文章。
    马耶夫斯基写道：英国保守党政府的政策在过去七、八个月中已经变得特别富于侵略性了。英国是伦敦和巴黎协定的倡议者之一。英国统治集团竭力支持对爱好和平的各国人民进行原子战争的准备工作，从而再一次证实了他们同意把英国变成美国的“原子弹飞机的航空母舰”。同美国一起，英国积极参加了在东南亚建立侵略性战争集团的活动，并且正在支持美国对中华人民共和国采取的侵略行动。
    可是，美、英两国政府之间的这种合作绝没有消除英、美两国间的分歧，相反地，在这种合作的过程中，不仅美、英两国之间的分歧越来越尖锐了，而且英联邦本身的内部分歧也在越来越尖锐。
    在这种情况下，前些日子在伦敦闭幕的英联邦总理会议便被要求来支持英国的政策，来团结英联邦为英国垄断资本的利益而斗争。
    马耶夫斯基引用报纸的消息说：会议是围绕着
  “区域防务”问题，或者更确切一点说，是围绕着英国在欧洲和亚洲的战争准备的问题进行的。
    在会议期间，保守党政府领袖邱吉尔和艾登暴露出他们自己是侵略性的北大西洋集团的热心卫护者。
    马耶夫斯基接着写道：英国根据巴黎协定承担的在欧洲驻扎大量武装部队的义务——这是和对爱好和平的各国人民进行战争准备有关的——要求英联邦的支持。这样就形成了一种热心于加强英帝国的人士所一直担心的局势。英国在欧洲承担的军事义务的增加意味着自治领的负担加重和它们的财政困难的增加，而归根结底意味着英联邦的联系的削弱。这一切都会为美国增加对英帝国的压力提供新的机会。
    邱吉尔不会得到所有英联邦国家对他的“新战略”计划的主要项目——复活西德“国防军”的政策——的支持。
    英国在欧洲的“战略”的重大修改同英国在阿拉伯东方和东南亚的新策划有着密切的联系，这种新策划也需要英联邦国家的支持。
    英美矛盾是英国在阿拉伯东方的“战略”的真正原因，虽然，不用说，在某些问题上，英、美帝国主义的侵略意图在那个地区是一致的。
    英国在东南亚和远东的新策划也是如此。
    从外国报纸消息中可以肯定地看出：英国企图利用伦敦会议来加强它同澳大利亚、新西兰及巴基斯坦在东南亚战争集团（东南亚条约组织）的范围内的行动一致。
    英国争取参加东南亚条约组织的英帝国各成员国的支持，这种努力看来是想设法加强它在那个集团即将举行的曼谷会议上的地位。
    但是，争取东南亚条约组织内的支配地位的斗争绝没有分散英国对它自己在那个地区的主要任务的注意，这个主要任务就是扩大马来亚的殖民战争。英国在伦敦会议上要求澳大利亚和新西兰加派部队到马来亚去，这绝不是偶然的。
    在扩大镇压亚洲人民民族解放运动的斗争中，英国保守党人像往常在这种情况下所做的那样，加紧了他们的所谓和平目的的叫嚷。他们提出了在中国海的地区“停火”的骗人口号。
    保守党政府的加强英国的帝国地位和使联邦国家支持英帝国主义的侵略计划的新努力，根本没有达到预期的目的。这个建筑在战争集团上的政策不但没有抑制住英帝国内部的离心力量，而且进一步加强了这种力量。同时，它也有使英美矛盾进一步尖锐化的可能；从美国报纸的消息可以看出，美国正在怀疑英国要加强它在欧洲和亚洲的影响。在侵略性的战争集团内，意见分歧的进一步加深是不可避免的。
