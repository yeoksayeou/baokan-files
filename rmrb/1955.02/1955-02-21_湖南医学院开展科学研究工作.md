    Hunan Medical College Carries Out Scientific Research Work
    Hunan Medical College held its second symposium on scientific research work from January 31st to February 4th.
    The symposium heard and discussed the scientific research work reports from the college's eleven research offices and teaching and research groups. These reports illustrate that since the first scientific research work symposium held by the college in April 1954, scientific research work has been carried out relatively normally and has achieved certain results. For example, the Industrial Hygiene Research Office conducted investigations and studies on industrial occupational diseases and the health status of workers in five factories and mines last year, and collected and compiled many important materials. Preliminary results have also been achieved in the experiments on the prevention and treatment of encephalitis. The Pharmacology Teaching and Research Group's research on traditional Chinese medicine, and the Parasitology Teaching and Research Group's research on local diseases in Hunan, such as malaria and schistosomiasis, have also achieved preliminary results.
    At the symposium, through discussion and research, the purpose of scientific research work in universities was clarified: on the one hand, it is to improve teaching quality and raise the level of teachers; on the other hand, it is to develop China's scientific culture to promote the country's construction in all aspects. Therefore, industrial occupational diseases, local diseases, infectious diseases, and traditional Chinese medicine were identified as the main contents of the college's current scientific research work. Based on their needs and conditions, each teaching and research group initially formulated specific plans for scientific research work in 1955. This year, the college's thirty-three teaching and research groups will conduct research on eighty-four projects. (Yin Sun)

    湖南医学院开展科学研究工作
    湖南医学院在一月三十一日到二月四日，举行了第二次科学研究工作座谈会。
    座谈会听取和讨论了该院十一个研究室和教研组的科学研究工作报告。这些报告说明：自一九五四年四月该院第一次科学研究工作座谈会以后，科学研究工作已比较正常地开展起来，并有了一定的收获。如工业卫生研究室去年曾往五个工厂和矿山进行了工业职业病及工人健康情况的调查研究，搜集、整理了许多重要资料。对脑炎的预防和治疗的实验上也取得了初步效果。药理学教研组对中药的研究，寄生虫学教研组对疟疾、血吸虫病等湖南地方病的研究，也已获得初步成绩。
    在座谈会上，经过讨论和研究，明确了高等学校科学研究工作的目的：一方面是为了提高教学质量，提高师资水平；另一方面是为了发展我国科学文化，以促进国家各方面的建设。因此，确定了工业职业病、地方病、传染病及中医中药为该院目前科学研究工作的主要内容。各教研组根据需要及本身条件，初步订出了一九五五年科学研究工作的具体计划。全院三十三个教研组在今年将要进行研究的项目有八十四个。　（荫荪）
