    The Turkish-Iraqi "Common Defense Treaty," concocted by the U.S. aggressive bloc, was signed on February 24th. The full text of the treaty has not yet been published, but according to Reuters: "This treaty will provide military assistance to any Middle Eastern country, including other members of the Arab League (if they request it), to defend themselves against 'foreign aggression' from within or outside the region." This shows that the intention of the United States is not only to incorporate Iraq into its war system through the Turkish-Iraqi treaty, but also to bring in more Middle Eastern countries. In fact, the United States has recently been putting pressure on Iran, Syria, Lebanon, and even Egypt, in an effort to find more partners for the Turkish-Iraqi treaty.
    The Turkish-Iraqi treaty is another step by the United States, after the Turkish-Pakistani alliance, in assembling a Middle East military bloc, and it is a war treaty. Since the "Middle East Command" plan proposed by the United States, Britain, France, and Turkey in 1951 was met with a cold reception by Arab countries, instigating Middle Eastern countries to "voluntarily" organize military alliances has become the main way for the United States to assemble a Middle East aggressive bloc. In this activity, Turkey has been assigned to act as an agent of U.S. imperialism. As for the purpose of this military alliance, it has long been made clear in the words of American power figures. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles once publicly stated that the Middle East region "is of great strategic importance, it is a bridge between Europe, Asia, and Africa"; and said that this region "has important resources that are closely related to our (U.S.) welfare (should be read as U.S. war plans) - oil, manganese, chromium, mica, and other minerals. About 60 percent of the proven oil reserves are in the Near East." The bellicose remarks of U.S. generals made this intention even more blatant. They believe that launching an attack from the Near and Middle East can stab into the "abdomen" of the Soviet Union—peaceful Central Asia. Taking the Middle East as a bridgehead for attacking the Soviet Union, and plundering the resources of these countries, enslaving the people of these countries, this is the real purpose of the United States organizing the Turkish-Pakistani alliance, the Turkish-Iraqi alliance, and other similar alliances.
    In the activities of piecing together the Middle East aggressive bloc, Britain played an ignoble supporting role. Britain is using its influence to force countries such as Jordan to participate in the Turkish-Iraqi treaty. Of course, Britain has its own plans: to get involved in the Turkish-Iraqi treaty and make it a joint venture between the United States and Britain in order to maintain Britain's position in the Near and Middle East. However, this plan is bound to fail sooner or later. After comparing the current situation of competition among imperialist countries in the Middle East with the situation at the end of World War II, the "New Statesman and Nation" magazine wrote: "In 1945, Britain pushed France into the back seat of the car, but now the United States has firmly taken the steering wheel." This Labor Party publication believes that the conclusion of the Turkish-Iraqi treaty is another failure for Britain in the Middle East.
    In order to create and expand the Turkish-Iraqi treaty, the U.S. aggressive bloc carried out blatant divisive activities against Middle Eastern countries. It openly stated that it would provide military assistance to "any Middle Eastern country" in order for that country to "deal with 'foreign aggression' from within or outside the region." This is an attempt to create discord among Arab countries and tension throughout the Middle East to facilitate its strengthening of control. These activities of the United States have been rebuked and opposed by Middle Eastern countries. Egyptian Prime Minister Nasser pointed out in an interview with a reporter from the Indian Newspaper Trust that Egypt opposes the Turkish-Iraqi treaty because this treaty will allow the military forces of Western countries to infiltrate the Middle East region, "which will undermine the stability of this region." The Egyptian Army spokesman further pointed out on February 24 that "Western countries are putting pressure on Egypt" and "want to force Egypt to agree to the proposed Turkish-Iraqi defense treaty." The U.S. aggressive bloc's arrogant sabotage of the unity of Arab countries, forcing Middle Eastern countries to accept aggressive military blocs, in order to separately control these countries and further interfere in their internal affairs, is a sample of the divisive activities the United States is carrying out around the world.
    Every sober-minded person in the Middle East countries can see very clearly: If they conclude an alliance with Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, it can only mean that these countries link their fate to the U.S. war plans, and in the final analysis, it will damage their own independence and make their own national interests subordinate to the interests of the U.S. aggressive bloc. The U.S. aggressive bloc wants to turn the Middle East countries into a battlefield in the anti-Soviet war. They want to further enslave and exploit the Middle Eastern people, which is absolutely incompatible with the interests of the Middle Eastern people in demanding peace, national independence, and economic prosperity.
    In order to conceal the essence of the Turkish-Iraqi treaty and divert the attention of the Middle Eastern people, U.S. imperialism and its followers, as usual, have to make a round of anti-Soviet clamoring. At the same time, the Turkish government launched extensive diplomatic activities to "persuade" various countries to accept the "shelter" of the Turkish-Iraqi alliance. U.S. imperialism and its mouthpieces in the Middle East insisted that the region is facing a "threat" from the Soviet Union and that it lacks "defensive" power and is a "power vacuum." However, the objective facts in the Middle East provide a large number of arguments to prove that this threat does not come from the Soviet Union, but from Western colonial countries. It is well known that the Soviet Union has always pursued a good-neighborly policy towards Middle Eastern countries. The Middle Eastern countries and the Soviet Union have three thousand kilometers of territorial contiguity. Maintaining peaceful coexistence between them is very necessary for the Soviet Union and equally necessary for the Middle Eastern countries. What comes to the Middle East countries from Moscow are sports delegations and cultural delegations; what comes to various countries from Washington are military delegations and oil monopolists. Isn't it the United States, not the Soviet Union, that is building or expanding military bases on the territories of Arab countries and Israel? It is also the colonialist countries, headed by the United States, not the Soviet Union, that monopolize the oil of the Middle Eastern countries and cruelly exploit the people of these countries. The Middle Eastern countries cannot but be suspicious of the "shelter" of the Turkish-Iraqi treaty, because Turkey's situation and status are not enviable at all. It is well known that as a result of Turkey's helping the United States in the war of aggression against Korea, a brigade it sent to the Korean battlefield suffered heavy casualties. Turkish ports have been taken by U.S. imperialism as its own ports. The Turkish navy is arbitrarily dispatched by American generals. On Turkish territory, there are more than 1,300 U.S. military delegations stationed.
    It is precisely for these reasons that the public in various Middle Eastern countries strongly opposes the Turkish-Iraqi treaty, and the governments of most countries have condemned this treaty, which is completely understandable. Egyptian Minister of National Guidance, Salah Salem, told reporters: "Concluding a military alliance with Turkey means participating in an alliance with Britain and the United States," and Arab countries "should adopt a national independent policy." The joint communiqué issued after the meeting between the Prime Ministers of India and Egypt in mid-February pointed out: "Military alliances and combinations of strength that increase tensions and the arms race will not help the security of a country." Saudi Arabian King Saud also made a stern condemnation of those who attempted to participate in the Turkish-Iraqi treaty in a statement issued on February 11. He said: "They will be responsible before history and the Arab people for endangering all Arab countries to become a stepping stone for imperialism." The Iraqi people have shed their blood on the streets of Baghdad in order to prevent their country from becoming a base for the U.S. anti-Soviet war. Demonstrations or student strikes broke out in the capitals of many Middle Eastern countries. The firm will of the people of Middle Eastern countries has been reflected in the policies of various governments. Recently, some people in the Syrian government, under pressure from the United States, had a tendency to participate in the Turkish-Iraqi treaty, which resulted in the Fares al-Khoury cabinet losing the support of the parliament and having to resign. The newly formed Sabri al-Asali cabinet has announced that the first point of its plan is to refuse to participate in military treaties and military alliances.
    Of course, it would be wrong to ignore the danger of U.S. and British imperialism instigating aggressive blocs in the Near and Middle East. There are indeed short-sighted people in the Near and Middle East who want to rely on foreign forces to suppress the liberation movement of their own people in order to consolidate their own position and rule. For such people, it is necessary to remind them of the fact that participating in a military alliance planned by Washington means risking their own country being used by U.S. imperialism as a battlefield in a future war of aggression. Any form of "Middle East Defense Organization" instigated by the United States is essentially an appendage of the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. The two paths of peace and war are so clearly placed before these people that they should be able to make the right choice.

    土伊条约—美国拼凑中东军事集团的一个步骤
    朱力如
    由美国侵略集团一手策动的土耳其——伊拉克
  “共同防御条约”，已经在二月二十四日签字了。条约的全文还没有公布，但据路透社透露：“这个条约将给予包括阿拉伯联盟其他成员国在内的任何中东国家以军事援助（如果它们要求的话），以保卫它们自己来对付这个地区以内或以外的‘外国侵略’。”这说明美国的意图还不仅在于通过土伊条约把伊拉克纳入它的战争体系，而且要拉更多的中东国家进去。事实上，美国最近正对伊朗、叙利亚、黎巴嫩、甚至埃及施加压力，力图为土伊条约搜罗更多的伙伴。
    土伊条约是美国在拼凑中东军事集团方面继土巴同盟之后的又一步骤，它是一个战争条约。自一九五一年由美、英、法、土四国提出的“中东司令部”计划遭到了阿拉伯国家的冷遇以后，策动中东国家“自行”组织军事同盟，便成为美国拼凑中东侵略集团的主要方式。在这一活动中，土耳其被派定充当美帝国主义的代理人。至于这种军事同盟的目的，在美国当权人物的言谈中，早已说得很清楚了。美国国务卿杜勒斯就曾公开说过：中东地区
  “在战略上有巨大的重要意义，它是欧洲、亚洲和非洲之间的桥梁”；并且说，这个地区“有和我们
  （美国）福利（应读为美国的战争计划）有密切关系的重要资源——石油、锰、铬、云母及其他矿产。约有百分之六十已被证明了的石油贮藏是在近东。”美国将军们的好战言论，把这种意图说的更加露骨。他们认为从中近东出击，可以一刀刺进苏联的“小腹”——和平建设中的中亚细亚。把中东当作进攻苏联的桥头堡，并掠夺这些国家的资源，奴役这些国家的人民，这就是美国组织土巴同盟、土伊同盟以及其他类似的各种同盟的真正目的。
    在拼凑中东侵略集团的活动中，英国充当了一个不光彩的配角。英国正在运用自己的影响，迫使约旦等国参加土伊条约。当然，英国是有它自己的打算的：在土伊条约中插上一脚，使它成为美英合营的股份公司，以便保持英国在中近东的地位。但是，这种打算迟早是要落空的。“新政治家与民族”杂志把帝国主义国家今天在中东竞争的情况和第二次世界大战结束时的情况作一比较后写道：“在
  一九四五年时英国把法国推到汽车后座去，而现在美国已经牢牢地掌住了驾驶盘。”这个工党的刊物认为土伊条约的缔结是英国在中东的又一步失败。
    美国侵略集团为了制造和扩大土伊条约，对中东国家进行了露骨的分裂活动。它公然要把军事援助给“任何中东国家”以便这个国家“对付这个地区以内或以外的‘外国侵略’”。这就是企图造成阿拉伯国家的不和以及整个中东地区的紧张关系以便于它来加强控制。美国的这种活动遭到了中东国家的斥责和反对。埃及总理纳赛尔在对印度报业托辣斯记者的谈话中，就曾指出，埃及所以反对土伊条约，是因为这个条约将使得西方国家的军事势力渗入到中东地区，“这将破坏这个地区的稳定”。埃及陆军发言人在二月二十四日进一步指出，“西方国家对埃及施加压力”，“想迫使埃及同意拟议中的土耳其—伊拉克防御条约”。美国侵略集团这样蛮横地破坏阿拉伯国家的团结，逼迫中东国家接受侵略性的军事集团，以便分别控制这些国家并进一步干涉这些国家的内政的阴谋，正是美国在世界各处制造分裂活动的样本。
    中东国家中每一个头脑清醒的人都看得很清楚：如果同北大西洋侵略集团的成员国土耳其缔结同盟，只能意味着这些国家把自己的命运和美国的战争计划联结起来，归根到底，就是损害他们本国的独立，使本国的民族利益从属于美国侵略集团的利益。美国侵略集团是想把中东国家变为反苏战争中的战场，它们要进一步奴役和剥削中东人民，这和中东人民要求和平、民族独立和经济上的繁荣的利益是绝对不能相容的。
    为了掩饰土伊条约的本质，转移中东人民的视线，美帝国主义及其追随者，照例要作一番反苏叫嚣。与此同时，土耳其政府则展开了广泛的外交活动，“劝说”各国接受土伊同盟的“庇护”。美帝国主义和它在中东的喉舌，硬说这个地区面临着苏联的“威胁”，它自己又缺乏“防御”力量，是个
  “实力上的真空地带”。但是，中东的客观事实，却提供了大量的论据，证明这种威胁不是来自苏联，而来自西方的殖民国家。众所周知，苏联对中东国家一向奉行着睦邻政策。中东国家和苏联有三千公里的领土接壤，它们之间保持和平共处的关系，对苏联是十分必要的，对中东国家同样是十分必要的。从莫斯科来到中东各国的，是体育代表团和文化代表团；从华盛顿来到各国的，是军事代表团和石油垄断资本家。在阿拉伯国家和以色列的领土上修建或扩建军事基地的，难道不是美国而是苏联吗？垄断中东各国的石油，残酷地榨取这些国家的人民的也是以美国为首的殖民主义国家而不是苏联。对于土伊条约的“庇护”，中东国家也不能不加以怀疑，因为土耳其的处境和地位，没有一点是值得羡慕的。人所共知，由于土耳其在侵朝战争中给美国帮凶的结果，它派到朝鲜战场上的一个旅遭到了重大的伤亡。土耳其的港口已被美帝国主义当作自己的港口。土耳其的海军，被美国的将军任意调遣。在土耳其的领土上，驻扎着为数达一千三百人以上的美国军事代表团。
    正是因为这些原因，中东各国公众强烈的反对土伊条约，大多数国家的政府也对这个条约加以谴责，这是完全可以理解的。埃及国家指导部长赛拉·萨勒姆对新闻记者说：“同土耳其缔结军事联盟就意味着参加同英国和美国的联盟”，阿拉伯国家“应该采取民族的独立政策”。二月中旬印度和埃及两国总理会谈后发表的公报指出：“增加紧张局势与军备竞赛的军事同盟和实力上的结合，对一个国家的安全，不会有什么帮助。”沙特阿拉伯国王沙特在二月十一日发表的一篇声明中，也对企图参加土伊条约的人作了严正的谴责。他说：“他们要在历史和阿拉伯人民的面前，对于使所有阿拉伯国家遭受到成为帝国主义的踏板的危险负责。”伊拉克人民为了不致使本国国土变成美国反苏战争中的基地，已经在巴格达的街头流了自己的鲜血。中东许多国家的首都爆发了示威游行或学生罢课。中东各国人民的坚定意志，已经反映到各国政府的政策上。最近，叙利亚政府中的一些人员在美国的压力下，曾有参加土伊条约的倾向，结果使法雷斯·扈利内阁失去了议会的支持，不得不提出辞职。新组成的萨布里·阿萨利内阁，已经宣布它的计划的第一点就是拒绝参加军事条约和军事同盟。
    当然，如果因此而忽视美英帝国主义在中近东策动侵略集团的危险，也是错误的。中近东确有近视的人，想依靠外国的力量，来镇压本国人民的解放运动，以巩固自己的地位和统治。对于这样一种人，需要提醒他们注意这样一个事实：参加华盛顿策划的军事同盟，就要冒着把自己的国土被美帝国主义当作未来侵略战争中的战场的危险。美国策动的任何一种形式的“中东防御组织”，实质上都是北大西洋侵略集团的附属品。和平和战争的两条道路如此分明地摆在这些人的面前，他们应该能够作出正确的选择。
