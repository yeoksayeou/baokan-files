Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, February 2nd: The Chinese People's Liberation Army troops on the Zhejiang front released another 21 Chiang Kai-shek soldiers captured in the battle of Yijiangshan Island on the 1st.

	These released Chiang Kai-shek soldiers were all from islands such as Dachen and Pishan, which are still occupied by the enemy. After they requested to return home, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army released them to return home to reunite with their families, according to the order issued by the Ministry of National Defense on January 1, 1955. Before their release, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army held a farewell party for them and provided them with sufficient travel expenses, food, and cotton clothing and shoes.

	These released Chiang Kai-shek soldiers expressed their gratitude for the lenient policy of the People's Liberation Army and for releasing them to return home to reunite with their families. As they left the shore and boarded the ship, they kept waving to the people who came to see them off to express their thanks.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, February 2nd: In the battle to liberate Yijiangshan Island, the various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the Zhejiang front conscientiously observed and implemented the five guarantees issued by Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai on New Year's Day this year regarding the earnest implementation of the policy towards Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers who surrendered or voluntarily laid down their weapons, and gave lenient treatment to Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers who laid down their weapons.

	On the afternoon of January 18, after our army landed on Yijiangshan Island, Shao Hongfa, a platoon leader of a certain unit, led his troops to charge onto the beachhead. A wounded Chiang Kai-shek soldier crawled out of a bunker destroyed by our army's artillery fire. He threw his gun aside, raised his hands above his head, and surrendered to our army. Shao Hongfa immediately ordered soldier Xie Dequan to bandage the wounded Chiang Kai-shek soldier and take him to a safe place. When a certain platoon was attacking the enemy's deep positions, the enemy in two bunkers resisted stubbornly, using firepower to hinder our army's advance. Squad leader Wu Changhai first explained our army's lenient policy to the captured Chiang Kai-shek soldiers, and then asked them to shout to the stubborn Chiang Kai-shek bandits. After the shouting, eleven Chiang Kai-shek soldiers crawled out of these two bunkers, raised their hands and surrendered to our army, thus guaranteeing their personal safety.

	Some Chiang Kai-shek officers and soldiers were deceived by Chiang Kai-shek's propaganda and were somewhat panicked and uneasy after being captured by our army. They wanted to give their watches, pens and other personal belongings to our army soldiers, but they were all rejected by our army soldiers. One prisoner wanted to give his personal belongings to our army soldier Song Tinghu. Song Tinghu immediately told him, "As long as you lay down your weapons, we will not touch any of your personal belongings." After a Chiang Kai-shek officer was captured, he wanted to give his personal watch and leather shoes to our army squad leader Lei Deming. Lei Deming refused on the spot and explained to him the order issued by our Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai on New Year's Day this year. The prisoners were all moved by our army's actions to conscientiously implement the lenient policy. Some said, "Chiang Kai-shek said that the People's Liberation Army has abolished the policy of leniency towards prisoners, that is completely a rumor he fabricated."

    我军释放一批在一江山岛被俘的蒋军官兵
    【新华社浙江前线二日电】浙江前线中国人民解放军部队在一日又释放二十一名在一江山岛战斗中被俘的蒋军官兵。
    这批被释放的蒋军官兵都是家在大陈、披山等现在尚被敌人盘踞的岛屿的人。当他们提出返乡的要求以后，解放军某部根据一九五五年一月一日国防部发布的命令释放他们回家。在释放前，解放军某部为他们举行了欢送会，并发给他们足够的路费、食物和棉衣鞋袜等物品。
    这些被释放的蒋军官兵对解放军的宽大政策和释放他们回家同家人团聚，表示感激。当他们离岸上船以后，还不断向送行的人挥手道谢。
   【新华社浙江前线二日电】浙江前线中国人民解放军各部队在解放一江山岛的战斗中，切实地遵守和执行了国防部彭德怀部长在今年元旦发布的关于切实执行对投诚或自动放下武器的蒋军官兵的五条保证的命令，给予放下武器的蒋军官兵以宽大待遇。
    一月十八日下午，当我陆军登上一江山岛后，某部排长邵洪发率领部队冲上滩头阵地时，从被我军炮火摧毁的一个地堡里钻出了一个受了伤的蒋军士兵，他把枪摔到一旁，双手举过头顶，向我军投降。邵洪发当即命令战士谢德全给这个受伤的蒋军士兵包扎了伤口，并把他带到了安全地点。当某排向蒋贼军纵深阵地攻击时，有两个地堡里的敌人进行顽抗，用火力阻挠我军前进。班长吴长海先对已经被俘的蒋军士兵解释了我军的宽大政策，然后叫他们对顽抗的蒋贼军喊话。经过喊话后，就从这两个地堡里钻出来十一个蒋军士兵，举着双手向我军投降，他们因而得到了生命安全的保障。
    有一些蒋军官兵因受蒋贼的欺骗宣传，被我军俘掳后有些恐慌不安，想把自己的手表、钢笔和其它私人财物送给我军战士，但都被我军战士拒绝。有一个俘虏要把他的私人财物送给我军战士宋廷湖，宋廷湖立即告诉他说：“只要放下武器，我们一律不动你们的私人财物。”一个蒋军军官被俘后要把私人的手表、皮鞋送给我军班长雷德明。雷德明当场拒绝了，并向他讲解了我国防部长彭德怀在今年元旦发布的命令。俘虏们都为我军切实地执行宽大政策的行动所感动，有的说：“蒋介石说解放军取消了宽待俘虏的政策，那完全是他造的谣。”
