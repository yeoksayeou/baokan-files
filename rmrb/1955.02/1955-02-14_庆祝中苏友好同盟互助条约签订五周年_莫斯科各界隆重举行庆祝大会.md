    【Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 13th】Moscow's circles held a grand celebration at the Column Hall of the Trade Union Building on the evening of the 12th to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance.

    The magnificent Column Hall was adorned in festive attire. All the grand chandeliers shone brightly. A huge Chinese and Soviet national flag was hung on the rostrum. Spotlights illuminated the national emblems of China and the Soviet Union on both sides.
    On the central wall of the rostrum, a red banner with golden characters written in Chinese and Russian read: "Long live the unbreakable friendship and cooperation between the people of the Soviet Union and China – a powerful factor for world peace! May this friendship and cooperation flourish and develop!"
    The orchestra played beautiful melodies in the hall. Soviet comrades, Chinese comrades, and comrades from fraternal countries entered the Column Hall one after another to participate in the grand event. The hall was filled with well-known social figures, actors and artists, academicians of the Academy of Sciences, labor heroes, and Soviet and foreign journalists. Many diplomatic envoys and diplomatic personnel from various countries stationed in the Soviet Union were also seated in the hall. Approximately one thousand people participated in this grand event.
    Seated on the rostrum were Soviet Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Mikoyan, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation Tarasov, Soviet Minister of Culture Alexandrov, Deputy Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions Solovyov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Nesmeyanov, Soviet Ambassador to China Yudin, Director of TASS Parguonov, Editor-in-Chief of "Pravda" Shepilov, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union Kuznetsov, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Moscow City Soviet Yasnov, Chairman of the Soviet Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Denisov, Editor-in-Chief of "Trud" Burkov, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Soviet Writers' Union Polevoy, as well as well-known Soviet figures in science and culture.

As Molotov has rightly pointed out, the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China are the leading countries of the powerful democratic and socialist camp, and this camp unswervingly implements a policy of safeguarding peace and international security. Ordinary, honest, and progressive people all over the world see the Soviet Union and China as truly powerful and invincible forces. They possess vast human resources, inexhaustible natural wealth, vast territories, and common borders. This strength is unprecedented; it does not threaten anyone, but it is not afraid of anyone's threats, and it can withstand any test.
    At the end of his speech, Denisov shouted: Long live the eternal Soviet-Chinese friendship – a beacon of human peace and progress! May the unbreakable unity of the Soviet and Chinese peoples continue to strengthen! Long live international peace and security!
    Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Liu Xiao then spoke at the meeting. He said that the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance gave China the greatest ally and the strongest friendly assistance from its side. In the past five years, the Soviet Union has provided China with comprehensive and systematic assistance in economic construction. This fraternal assistance is an important factor in the great progress of China's socialist construction. No force in the world can destroy the close fraternal friendship between China and the Soviet Union.
    Ambassador Liu Xiao also paid tribute to the great Soviet people on behalf of the Chinese people.
    Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences Pankratova and famous train driver Blazhenov spoke. Pankratova spoke about the achievements of Chinese science. Blazhenov spoke about his friendship with Chinese railway workers during his visit to China.
    Famous director Gerasimov read out a congratulatory telegram sent by Soong Ching Ling, President of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.
    The celebration was followed by a grand artistic performance. The Soviet National Folk Dance Troupe, the Red Flag Song and Dance Ensemble of the Soviet Army, and the opera and dance actors of the Moscow Grand Theater gave wonderful performances. They performed the Chinese Peking Opera "San岔口" and sang songs such as "Moscow-Beijing" and "Lan Hua Hua" in Chinese. Every program received the cheers and applause of the audience.
