Lenin said: "Marxism is the legitimate successor to the outstanding achievements created by mankind in the nineteenth century, namely, German philosophy, British political economy, and French socialism." Marx and Engels critically inherited these outstanding achievements, summarized the experience of the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed classes for many centuries, and created the scientific theory of communism. The emergence of this theory was a great revolution in the history of social thought. This theory was formed in a sharp struggle against the reactionary bourgeois ideological system. Contrary to all other ideological systems, it expresses the fundamental interests of the working class and all laborers. The works of Marx and Engels contained in "Selected Works of Marx and Engels" (two-volume set) expound the three components of Marxism: philosophy, political economy, and socialism.

The Chinese version of Volume One of "Selected Works of Marx and Engels" (two-volume set), published by the Foreign Languages Publishing House in Moscow in 1954, collects the main works of Marx and Engels from the end of 1847 to July 1874, a total of twenty-four articles including "The Communist Manifesto."

"The Communist Manifesto" was written by Marx and Engels in late 1847 and early 1848 as the program of the "Communist League." This is the first work of scientific communism, a masterpiece of human thought, and the "song of songs of Marxism" (Stalin). Here, Marx and Engels formulated the basic principles of scientific communism and comprehensively expounded the world outlook of the proletariat. They not only scientifically proved that "the demise of the bourgeoisie and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable," but also revealed the worldwide historical mission of the proletariat, the gravedigger of the capitalist system and the creator of socialist society, and pointed out the idea that the proletariat must seize power, become the ruling class, and fight for democracy; at the same time, they also criticized various non-proletarian (bourgeois and petty-bourgeois) socialist trends of thought. Here, Marx and Engels armed the working class and working people of all countries with revolutionary theory and struggle strategies, enabling them to effectively carry out the struggle for liberation against exploitation and oppression.

Marx's three works on the history of nineteenth-century France: "The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850," "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte" (i.e., "The Coup d'État of Napoleon III"), and "The Civil War in France," are brilliant examples of applying the historical materialist method to analyze specific historical events. At the same time, these works also have great theoretical significance, reflecting the development of Marxist theory on proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. In "The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850," Marx profoundly analyzed the nature, driving force, and course of events of the French Revolution of 1848, and based on the experience of this revolution, he demonstrated the tactics of the proletariat in the bourgeois revolution and the necessity of the worker-peasant alliance. In "The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte," Marx drew the conclusion based on the experience of class struggle in France from 1848 to 1851: in order to establish the dictatorship of the proletariat, it is first necessary to destroy the bourgeois state apparatus. In "The Civil War in France," Marx analyzed the experience of the Paris Commune and concluded that the most appropriate form of the proletarian state is precisely the political organization of the Paris Commune, rather than a parliamentary republic.

Dialectical materialism is the world outlook of the proletariat. Scientific communism arises from this philosophical system. In "Excerpt from the Afterword to the Second German Edition of 'Capital', Volume One," Marx criticized Hegel's idealist dialectics and expressed the characteristics of his own materialist dialectics. In "Preface to 'A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'," Marx brilliantly expressed the essence of historical materialism, that is, applying the principles of dialectical materialism to the study of social life. This work by Marx comprehensively expresses the scientific principles concerning the socio-economic structure, the economic base and the superstructure, and the relationship between social existence and social consciousness. Engels' article "On Karl Marx's 'A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'" introduces the principles of the materialist conception of history expressed by Marx in this preface.

"Capital" is Marx's immortal work. Here, he brilliantly used dialectical materialism to study capitalist society, analyzed the historical process of the emergence, development, and decline of capitalist society, and proved that this society will inevitably be replaced by socialist society. Section 7 of Chapter 24 of Volume One of "Capital," included in this book, "The General Law of Capitalist Accumulation," reveals the historical trend of capitalist accumulation, the intensification of contradictions between the working class and the bourgeoisie, and points out the inevitability of proletarian revolution and the "expropriation of the expropriators." Engels' "Marx's 'Capital'" and "Preface to 'Capital' Volume Two" (excerpts) concisely introduce the content of Marx's great work. Here, Engels pointed out the worldwide historical significance of the working class's struggle and clarified the main cornerstone of Marx's economic theory—the theory of surplus value.

"Wage Labour and Capital" and "Wages, Price and Profit" are two economic works written by Marx for the broad masses of workers. The former was written based on a lecture given by Marx at the German Workers' Association in Brussels in 1847. The latter was a report given by Marx at two meetings of the General Council of the International Workingmen's Association in 1865. In these two works, Marx profoundly analyzed from a theoretical perspective the economic relations that constitute the foundation of the bourgeoisie's class rule, and elucidated the source and essence of surplus value in an accessible way. Readers can understand Marx's economic theory from here and draw the revolutionary conclusion that the working class must fight to eliminate capitalist slavery.

Engels' "The Housing Question" is one of the basic works of scientific socialism. Here, Engels criticized the solutions to the housing problem proposed by German Proudhonists and other bourgeois reformers, and turned this criticism into an indictment of the entire capitalist system. Engels demonstrated the Marxist view on the housing question, pointing out that the housing problem cannot be solved under the capitalist system and can only be fully solved under socialism. At the same time, Engels also explained some conclusions in Marx's economic theory in a popular way and used these conclusions to analyze various aspects of capitalist reality. In this work, Engels also explored the important theoretical issue of eliminating the opposition between town and country, pointing out that the elimination of this opposition is only possible in a communist society.

The founders of scientific communism, Marx and Engels, from the mid-1840s, firmly linked their fate to the fate of the working class and became the organizers and leaders of the international proletariat. At that time, they actively promoted communist ideas among advanced workers and strove to organize the proletarian party. In 1847, Marx and Engels founded the first international communist organization of the proletariat, the "Communist League." "Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League" written by Marx and Engels analyzed the specific political situation and the tactics of the proletariat in Germany at that time, and put forward the principle of uninterrupted revolution, which was developed by Lenin in the era of imperialism into the theory of the transition of the bourgeois democratic revolution to the socialist revolution. The International Workingmen's Association was founded in 1864, and "Marx was the soul of this group" (Lenin). He took on the task of leading this organization and drafted many documents for it. "Inaugural Address of the International Workingmen's Association" and "Provisional Rules of the International Workingmen's Association" are among the most important documents. In these two programmatic documents, Marx succinctly analyzed the reasons for the failure of the Revolution of 1848 and the deterioration of the situation of the working class in various countries after this revolution, as well as the situation of the workers' revolutionary movement, calling on the working classes of all countries to unite and fight for their own liberation. In addition, Marx also put forward the task of the working class seizing power here. The article "The Civil War in France" contained in this book was also written as a declaration of the International Workingmen's Association. Marx's "On Proudhon" and Engels' "On Authority" contained in this book also clearly reflect their consistent opposition to various utopian and petty-bourgeois socialist ideas and to sectarianism in the workers' movement.

In the mid-nineteenth century, Marx and Engels were extremely concerned about the fate of the people of the Eastern countries. As everyone knows, at that time they wrote a series of papers on the problems of China and India. The articles "The British Rule in India" and "The Future Results of British Rule in India" written by Marx and contained in this book are the most important treatises on the Indian problem. Here, Marx analyzed the colonial policies adopted by Britain in India and discussed the profound disasters that this policy brought to the Indian people. At the same time, Marx also demonstrated the prospects for revolution in Britain and India. The current situation in India and the increasingly collapsing imperialist colonial system prove the correctness of Marx's predictions.

The above is the main content of Volume One of "Selected Works of Marx and Engels" (two-volume set).

    关于“马克思恩格斯文选”第一卷的内容
    列宁说过：“马克思主义是人类在十九世纪所造成的那些优秀成果，即德国哲学、英国政治经济学和法国社会主义底当然继承者。”马克思和恩格斯批判地继承了那些优秀成果，概括了好多世纪以来各被压迫阶级革命斗争的经验，创立了科学的共产主义学说。这个学说的产生是社会思想发展史上的一个伟大革命。这个学说是在反对反动的资产阶级思想体系的尖锐斗争中形成的，它跟其他一切思想体系相反，是表现工人阶级和全体劳动者的根本利益的。“马克思恩格斯文选”（两卷集）所载的马克思和恩格斯的著作，就是阐述马克思主义的三个组成部分：哲学、政治经济学和社会主义。
    一九五四年莫斯科外国文书籍出版局出版的
  “马克思恩格斯文选”（两卷集）第一卷中文本，其中收集了马克思和恩格斯在一八四七年底到一八七四年七月这段时期的主要著作，计有“共产党宣言”等二十四篇。
    “共产党宣言”是马克思和恩格斯于一八四七年底到一八四八年初作为“共产主义者同盟”的纲领写的。这是科学共产主义的头一部著作，是人类思想的杰作，是“马克思主义底歌之歌”（斯大林）。马克思和恩格斯在这里制定了科学共产主义的基本原则，全面地阐述了无产阶级的世界观。他们不仅科学地证明了“资产阶级底灭亡和无产阶级底胜利同样是不可避免的”，而且揭示了作为资本主义制度掘墓人和社会主义社会创造者的无产阶级所负的全世界历史使命，指出了无产阶级必须夺取政权，变成统治阶级，争得民主的思想；同时，还批判了各种非无产阶级的（资产阶级和小资产阶级）社会主义思潮。马克思和恩格斯在这里用革命理论和斗争策略武装了各国工人阶级和劳动人民，使他们卓有成效地去进行反对剥削和压迫的解放斗争。
    马克思关于十九世纪法国历史的三篇著作：“一八四八年至一八五○年的法兰西阶级斗争”“路易·波拿巴政变记”（即“拿破仑第三政变记”）和“法兰西内战”，是运用历史唯物主义方法分析具体历史事件的光辉范例。同时，这些著作又具有很大的理论意义，其中反映了马克思主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政学说的发展。在“一八四八年至一八五○年的法兰西阶级斗争”一文中，马克思深刻地分析了法国一八四八年革命的性质、动力及事变的进程，并根据这次革命的经验，论证了无产阶级在资产阶级革命中的策略和工农联盟的必要性。在“路易·波拿巴政变记”一文中，马克思根据法国一八四八到一八五一年阶级斗争的经验而作出了结论：为了建立无产阶级专政，首先必须摧毁资产阶级的国家机构。在“法兰西内战”一文中，马克思分析了巴黎公社的经验，进而得出结论说，无产阶级国家的最适当的形式正是巴黎公社式的政治组织，而不是国会制的共和国。
    辩证唯物主义是无产阶级的世界观。科学的共产主义就是从这个哲学体系中产生出来的。在“‘资本论’第一卷德文第二版跋文摘录”里，马克思批判了黑格尔的唯心主义辩证法，表述了自己的唯物主义辩证法的特征。在“‘政治经济学批判’一书序言”中，马克思天才地表述了历史唯物主义的实质，即把辩证唯物主义原理应用于研究社会生活。马克思这篇著作概括地表述了关于社会经济结构，关于经济基础和上层建筑以及社会存在和社会意识之间的关系的科学原理。恩格斯的“论卡尔·马克思著‘政治经济学批判’一书”一文就是介绍马克思在这篇序言中所表述的唯物史观的原理的。
      “资本论”是马克思的不朽著作，他在这里天才地运用辩证唯物主义研究了资本主义社会，分析了资本主义社会发生、发展和衰落的历史过程，证明了这个社会不可避免地将为社会主义社会所代替。本书所收入的“资本论”第一卷第二十四章第七节“资本主义积累的历史趋势”，揭示了资本主义积累的历史趋势，工人阶级和资产阶级矛盾尖锐化，并指明了无产阶级革命和“剥夺篡夺者”的必然性。恩格斯著的“马克思著的‘资本论’”和
  “‘资本论’第二卷序言”（摘录）两文，简明扼要地介绍了马克思这部伟大著作的内容。恩格斯在这里指出了工人阶级斗争的全世界历史意义，阐明了马克思经济理论的主要基石——剩余价值学说。
      “雇佣劳动与资本”和“工资、价格和利润”两文是马克思为广大工人群众写的两篇经济著作。前一篇是以马克思于一八四七年在布鲁塞尔德意志工人协会作的讲演为基础写成的。后一篇是马克思于一八六五年在国际工人协会总委员会两次会议上作的报告。马克思在这两篇著作中深入浅出地从理论上深刻分析了构成资产阶级的阶级统治基础的经济关系，阐明了剩余价值的来源和实质。读者从这里可以了解马克思的经济学说，并做出工人阶级必须为消灭资本主义奴隶制而斗争的革命的结论。
    恩格斯著的“论住宅问题”是科学社会主义的基本著作之一。恩格斯在这里批判了德国蒲鲁东主义者及其他资产阶级改良派解决住宅问题的方案，并把这一批判变成了对整个资本主义制度的控诉书。恩格斯论证了马克思主义者对住宅问题的观点，指出住宅问题在资本主义制度下是不可能解决的，只有在社会主义之下才能完全解决。同时，恩格斯在这里还通俗地解释了马克思经济学说中的一些结论，并运用这些结论分析了资本主义现实生活的各个方面。恩格斯在这本著作中还探讨了消除城乡对立的重要理论问题，指出这一对立的消除只有在共产主义社会才有可能。
    科学共产主义的创始人马克思和恩格斯，从十九世纪四十年代中叶起，就把自己的命运跟工人阶级的命运牢牢地联系起来，而成为国际无产阶级的组织者和领袖。当时他们在先进的工人中间就积极地宣传共产主义的思想，并力谋组织无产阶级的政党。一八四七年马克思和恩格斯创立了无产阶级的头一个国际共产主义组织“共产主义者同盟”。马克思和恩格斯写的“中央委员会告共产主义者同盟书”分析了当时德国具体的政治局势和无产阶级的策略，并提出了不停顿革命的原理，这个原理在帝国主义时代由列宁发展成了资产阶级民主革命转变为社会主义革命的理论。一八六四年国际工人协会成立，“马克思是这个团体底灵魂”（列宁），他担起了领导这个组织的任务，为它起草了许多文件。“国际工人协会成立宣言”和“国际工人协会共同规章”就是其中最重要的文件。在这两个纲领性的文件中，马克思简明扼要地分析了一八四八年革命失败的原因及这次革命失败后各国工人阶级状况的恶化和工人革命运动的情况，号召各国工人阶级团结起来，为争取自己的解放而斗争。此外，马克思在这里还提出了工人阶级夺取政权的任务。本书所载“法兰西内战”一文也是作为国际工人协会的宣言而写的。本书所载马克思的“论蒲鲁东”和恩格斯的“论权威”两文，也都很明显地反映了他们一贯反对各种空想的和小资产阶级的社会主义及反对工人运动中宗派主义的斗争。
    在十九世纪中叶，马克思和恩格斯对东方各国人民的命运极为关切。大家知道，当时他们曾写了一系列关于中国、印度问题的论文。本书所载马克思著的“不列颠在印度的统治”和“不列颠在印度统治的未来结果”两文，就是关于印度问题的最重要的论著。在这里马克思分析了英国在印度所采取的殖民政策，并论述了这一政策给印度人民带来的深重灾难。同时，马克思在这里还展示了英国和印度革命的远景。今天印度的情况以及帝国主义殖民体系日益崩溃的事实都证明了马克思预见的正确。
    以上就是“马克思恩格斯文选”（两卷集）第一卷的主要内容。
