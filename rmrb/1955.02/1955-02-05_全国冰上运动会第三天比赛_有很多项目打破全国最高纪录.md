National Ice Sports Meet, day three of competition.
The third day of the 1955 National Ice Sports Meet took place on the afternoon of the 3rd, amidst falling snow. On this day, Chinese and Soviet athletes held friendly exhibition matches in the men's and women's 500-meter speed skating events.

Eleven athletes from the Soviet skating delegation participated in the exhibition. Soviet athletes Grach and Belova set the highest records of the day in the men's and women's 500-meter speed skating events with times of 44 seconds and 50.1 seconds, respectively.

In the men's 500-meter speed skating exhibition, Harbin athlete Li Zaixiong and Soviet athlete Kozlov performed in the same group. Shortly after the start of the performance, Li Zaixiong was on par with Kozlov. However, due to Kozlov's superior turning technique, he overtook Li Zaixiong at the turn. At this time, Li Zaixiong still closely followed. Kozlov started a brave sprint about 100 meters from the finish line, reaching the finish line first in 45.4 seconds. Subsequently, Li Zaixiong also reached the finish line in 47.6 seconds, breaking his own national record of 49 seconds. In addition, two other Chinese athletes also broke the national record.

In the women's 500-meter speed skating exhibition between Chinese and Soviet athletes, three Chinese athletes broke the national record of 1 minute 1.5 seconds. Among them, Harbin athlete Li Shuyun had the best result at 55.8 seconds.

The ice hockey final between the Changchun and Beijing ice hockey teams, held in the center of the ice rink, attracted many spectators. The result of the match was 4-1, with the Changchun ice hockey team winning.

That afternoon, the conference awarded prizes to the twelve outstanding Chinese male and female athletes who participated in the 500-meter speed skating competition and presented commemorative awards to all the athletes of the Soviet skating delegation. After the award ceremony, the winners and Soviet athletes circled the field hand in hand, with the audience applauding them repeatedly, congratulating them on their victory.

In the evening, Chinese and Soviet athletes performed in the women's 3,000-meter and men's 5,000-meter speed skating events. Exciting news was constantly broadcast over the loudspeakers, as all three Chinese athletes participating in the women's 3,000-meter speed skating exhibition broke the national record of 7 minutes and 2.7 seconds. Harbin athlete Jin Fushun fell shortly after the start, but she immediately got up and continued to skate forward, eventually achieving a result of 6 minutes and 32.8 seconds.

Eight Chinese athletes participated in the men's 5,000-meter speed skating event, with seven breaking the national record.

The men's 1,500-meter speed skating competition concluded, with seven athletes breaking the national record of 2 minutes and 48.6 seconds. Harbin athlete Jiang Yingxing achieved the best result, reaching 2 minutes and 39.2 seconds.
