The Chinese Writing Reform Committee Publishes the "Draft Plan for Chinese Character Simplification"

    In January, the Chinese Writing Reform Committee published the "Draft Plan for Chinese Character Simplification," soliciting opinions from cultural and educational workers and people from all walks of life across the country.

    The "Draft Plan for Chinese Character Simplification" was formulated by the former Chinese Writing Reform Research Committee after numerous discussions and revisions since 1952, and was approved by the first meeting of the Chinese Writing Reform Committee.

    This draft plan is divided into four parts. The first part explains the purpose and method of Chinese character simplification, pointing out that the large number of Chinese characters, complex structures, multiple pronunciations for a single character, and variant forms of the same character have brought great difficulties to teaching and using Chinese characters. This has greatly hindered the popularization of culture and the improvement of the people's cultural level in our country. Therefore, appropriately simplifying Chinese characters and minimizing the difficulties in teaching, reading, writing, and practical use of Chinese characters is an urgent need at present.

    The second part is the draft table of 798 simplified Chinese characters. The vast majority of these adopt simplified characters or homophone substitutes that are already commonly used in society, stipulating that these characters be used to replace another 798 traditional characters, and that these traditional characters be abolished in books and newspapers. The purpose of this simplification is to simplify the writing strokes.

    The third part is the draft table of 400 variant characters to be abolished. The purpose of this part of the plan is to simplify the number of characters. The plan suggests that only one form of each character be retained among the 400 characters with multiple forms, and that all other characters be abolished. They will no longer be used in books and newspapers in the future.

    The fourth part is the draft table of simplified handwritten forms of Chinese character radicals. This part of the plan stipulates the simplified writing methods of Chinese characters, so that almost all Chinese characters have been simplified to varying degrees in writing.

    In January, the Chinese Writing Reform Committee printed 300,000 copies of the "Draft Plan for Chinese Character Simplification" and distributed them to all parts of the country. The Chinese Writing Reform Committee and the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China also issued a joint notice in January, requiring education departments and bureaus in various provinces and cities to organize Chinese language teachers in schools and people concerned with writing reform and mass education to conduct discussions; and to widely solicit opinions from all walks of life on the revision of this draft.

    After the draft has been discussed and opinions have been put forward throughout the country, the Chinese Writing Reform Committee will convene a national writing reform conference this year to discuss and approve the "Chinese Character Simplification Plan"; and then officially announce its implementation.

    中国文字改革委员会发表“汉字简化方案草案”
    中国文字改革委员会在一月份发表了“汉字简化方案草案”，向全国各地文化教育工作者和各界人士征求意见。
    “汉字简化方案草案”是前中国文字改革研究委员会从一九五二年起经过多次的讨论修改所拟定的，并经中国文字改革委员会第一次会议通过。
    这个方案草案分四部分。第一部分说明了汉字简化的目的和方法，指出：汉字字数繁多，结构复杂，一字多音，同字异体，给教学和使用汉字的人带来了很大的困难。这使我国文化的普及和人民文化水平的提高都受到很大阻碍。因此，适当的简化汉字，尽可能减少汉字在教学、阅读、书写和实用上的困难，是目前迫切需要的。
    第二部分是七百九十八个汉字简化表草案。其中绝大部分采用了社会上已经普遍通行的简笔字或同音代用字，规定以这些字代替另外七百九十八个繁体字，并在书报上废除这些繁体字。这一简化的目的在于简化笔法。
    第三部分是拟废除的四百个异体字表草案。这部分方案的目的在于简化字数，方案建议在四百个一字多体的字中，每一个字只保留一个字体，而将其它的字一律废除，今后在书报上也不再使用。
    第四部分是汉字偏旁手写简化表草案。这部分方案规定了汉字的简化写法，使差不多所有的汉字在书写上都得到了各种程度不同的简化。
    一月间，中国文字改革委员会已把“汉字简化方案草案”印制三十万份，分发全国各地。中国文字改革委员会和中华人民共和国教育部并已在一月间发出联合通知，要求各省市教育厅、局组织各学校语文教师和关心文字改革与群众教育的人士进行讨论；并广泛征求各界人士对这一草案的修改意见。
    待草案经过全国各地讨论和提出意见后，在今年内，中国文字改革委员会还将召开全国文字改革会议，讨论通过“汉字简化方案”；再正式公布实行。（新华社）
