Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 10th: N.S. Khrushchev received American journalists W.L. Hearst, Kingsbury Smith, and F. Conniff on February 5th. The following is an account of the conversation.

	Kingsbury Smith said that Hearst and his companions knew that Khrushchev was very busy due to the Supreme Soviet session, so they were very grateful that he could take the time to meet with them. Kingsbury Smith then said that they all noted with great interest the good things Khrushchev said about American farming methods in his recent speech at the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, especially what he said about these methods being a good example for Soviet agriculture. In this regard, Hearst wanted to ask Khrushchev a question.

	Hearst said that when he read Khrushchev's good evaluation of American methods of planting corn and grain, he thought it would be better if the Soviet people paid more attention to the good aspects of American life more often, and the Americans paid more attention to the good aspects of Soviet life more often. However, at present, they criticize each other too much and consider the positive aspects too little.

	Hearst asked if Khrushchev agreed.

	Khrushchev replied that he agreed and thought it would be very beneficial. In his opinion, the United States has many good things. He believed that Americans would also find many things in the Soviet Union that would interest them and be useful to them. This applies not only to agriculture but also to industry and other areas.

	Hearst said that because Khrushchev had given a good evaluation of certain aspects of American life, he wanted to express the hope that Khrushchev would one day be able to visit the United States (just as he—Hearst—and his companions had the opportunity to visit the Soviet Union) to see American agriculture and industry, etc., for himself, since it was understood that Khrushchev had never been to the United States.

	Khrushchev confirmed that he had indeed never been to the United States.

	Kingsbury Smith asked Khrushchev if he would be prepared to visit the United States to learn about American farming methods, especially in the area of animal husbandry, if he received an invitation to go to the United States at his convenience.

	Khrushchev replied that he would like to answer Hearst and Kingsbury Smith's questions together. He believed that it would always be beneficial for people to visit each other's countries without prejudice. In his opinion, it would be beneficial for the Soviets to visit the United States, both from an economic point of view and in terms of enhancing mutual understanding. Mikoyan had been to the United States, and he talked about many interesting and commendable things he had seen there.

	Kingsbury Smith said that V.M. Molotov had also been to the United States.

	Khrushchev replied that Molotov had been to the United States during the war and shortly after the war. He did not have the opportunity to learn about the country in as much detail as Mikoyan.

	As for him, Khrushchev, going to the United States, it would certainly be difficult at present, although, as he had said, he believed there were many interesting and beneficial things in the United States, such as in agriculture and agricultural machinery manufacturing. As for the organization of agriculture, those talking to him were certainly not interested in the collective farm system, and the Soviets would not be attracted to the American principles of agricultural organization. However, this does not prevent them from seeing the good things in the United States in terms of livestock breeding, agricultural machinery manufacturing, etc. Moreover, it should also be said that American agriculture is managed very economically, with a large amount of labor saving.

	Considering his, Khrushchev’s, position as Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, even an influential person in the United States would not dare to invite him. In that case, wouldn't someone in the United States say that he was trying to undermine the American system? In this regard, Khrushchev joked that he was worried that Hearst would have to go to the McCarthy Committee because he had talked to the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

	As for his, Khrushchev’s, trip to the United States, that would depend on many things. At present, Americans would not only not issue visas to someone like him, but they would not even issue visas to ordinary Soviet student newspaper editors, which seems very strange.

	Hearst said that he and his companions paid close attention to the Soviet government's decision to re-emphasize the development of heavy industry. Does this mean that it is again considered necessary to pay more attention to increasing the potential for national defense, or does it mean that the new program aims to expand the means of production in order to subsequently produce consumer goods?

	Khrushchev replied that it was clear that the Soviet government's measures to expand the production of consumer goods on a larger scale were misunderstood abroad, and some people thought that this meant reducing the work of developing heavy industry. Khrushchev said that we have always believed in the past, and still believe in the future, that all industrial sectors must develop in proportion, and that the development of heavy industry must exceed the development of other industries. Why must this be the case? Because heavy industry is the manufacture of means of production, and in order to improve living standards, it is necessary to increase productivity, and it is necessary to implement mechanization. But without metal, machines, and electricity, it is impossible to implement mechanization. Therefore, heavy industry is the foundation for developing the national economy.

	For example, the recent plenary session of the Central Committee of the CPSU passed a resolution on the further development of animal husbandry. What is animal husbandry? It is essentially the production of consumer goods. However, it is impossible to develop animal husbandry without developing heavy industry that supplies agriculture with tractors, agricultural machinery, etc. Therefore, it can be said that if the entire national economy is a synthesis of various economic sectors, then heavy industry should occupy a dominant position in this synthesis.

	As for whether the development of heavy industry is for national defense or for peaceful needs, Khrushchev believed that in the Soviet Union, the two are not contradictory. Khrushchev said, we are Communists, and for us, spending money on national defense is a last resort. We hope that it will be possible not to spend the people's money on national defense. Khrushchev said that he believes that this possibility will come one day. However, the current international situation forces the Soviet Union to spend some money on national defense. Americans believe that the Soviet Union is to blame for the current international tension. The Soviets, on the other hand, believe that this is America's fault, because America is building its military bases around the Soviet border and wants to deal with the Soviet Union on the basis of "positions of strength," as Churchill said, and Dulles and others often repeat this. In any case, under the current conditions, the Soviet Union has to use some of its financial and human resources to strengthen the country's defense capabilities. Khrushchev continued, but our main goal is to make our people happy and improve their living standards. At the same time, we also hope that not only our people, but also the people of other countries will be happy. The ultimate goal should not be to manufacture more cannons and atomic bombs—this is the result of the current abnormal international relations. Cannons and bombs cannot be regarded as the wealth of a country. It should be said that these things hinder the possibility of improving people's living standards.

	Kingsbury Smith thanked Khrushchev for his answer.

	Khrushchev said he would like to add something to his earlier comments on the “positions of strength” policy. Khrushchev believed that this is a very dangerous policy. It is dangerous because either side has to increase its strength, trying to make itself stronger than the other. This will only lead to the accumulation of more and more instruments of war. Whenever a large reserve of materials has been accumulated in the area of armaments, this always harbors the danger of the outbreak of war.

	Relations between countries should not be based on a policy of "positions of strength," but on a basis of mutual understanding. To this end, it is first necessary to develop normal trade on mutually beneficial terms. To this end, other countries should not be threatened. It is necessary to keep those madmen who frighten people with atomic bombs in check. This will bring peace to the people of all countries.

	The Soviet Union is working to develop normal business and trade relations with other countries in order to consolidate these normal relations and turn them into friendly relations. The Soviet Union has no issues in dispute with the United States. The Soviet people have friendly feelings towards the American people. If the US government wants something from the Soviet Union, it is certain that the US government will not get anything by means of extortion and threats. Threats and blackmail will not lead to anything, because the Soviet Union has never and will never give in to threats. If the US government hopes to get something from the Soviet Union, it can only get it on the basis of normal relations and normal trade.

	Khrushchev believed that there is strength to improve relations between our two countries, and healthy reason will prevail. As for himself, he advocated normal relations, normal trade, and the development of trade between the Soviet Union and the United States.

	Kingsbury Smith said that American leaders believed that they had tried to reach an understanding with the Soviet Union from what they considered to be a weaker position, but they found it impossible. Perhaps that is why they feel that if they want to solve problems with the Soviet Union, the West must first achieve the kind of equal or near-equal position that American leaders believe in.

	The United States disarmed immediately after the war. However, according to the information available to American leaders, there was reason to believe that the Soviet Union did not disarm at the same rate. Hearst said that the United States showed goodwill during the war, for example, in the Lend-Lease Act, and also suggested that the Soviet Union and the people's democracies take advantage of the benefits of the Marshall Plan.

	Kingsbury Smith continued that he did not believe that American leaders intended to impose their will on the Soviet Union, nor did they intend to extort anything from the Soviet Union. Their greatest hope was to maintain peaceful and friendly relations with the Soviet Union.

	Hearst went on to say that neither in the American Constitution nor in the writings of outstanding American leaders and thinkers is there any statement similar to the doctrines of Lenin and Marx, the so-called incompatibility of two systems, the so-called inevitability of the demise of one of the systems. This is one of the problems that worries Americans, because they believe that the Soviet Union's long-term plan is a reflection of this doctrine.

	N.S. Khrushchev pointed out that positions of strength and positions of weakness are, of course, two different things. The Soviet people recognize that every country has the right and should consider its own security and build armed forces sufficient to ensure its own security. And that is the balance of power that Kingsbury Smith was talking about. However, Churchill and later Dulles put forward the slogan of implementing a "positions of strength" policy. This means that one side hopes to impose its will on the other, hoping to be more powerful than the other. Such a policy harbors serious dangers. If one side continues to strengthen its forces, then the other side must do the same. This can only further escalate the atmosphere. Khrushchev believed that the "positions of strength" policy is a very bad policy, because it contains the danger of launching a new war.

	Someone said that the United States had demobilized after the war, but the Soviet Union had not. On this point, Khrushchev first pointed out that in the past war, the United States only lost hundreds of thousands of people, while the Soviet Union lost millions of people. What does this explain? This shows that during the war the entire Soviet Union, the entire country, was mobilized. The Soviet Union's armed forces have already been demobilized after the war. What remains is necessary for national security.

	If we start from the facts, then the facts do not confirm the claim that Hearst and other Westerners often make, that the Soviet Union maintains more troops than the West, and that this army poses a threat.

	The Soviet Union did not want to do anything harmful to the allies in the anti-Hitler struggle. Everyone knows that five years ago, the United States mobilized fewer forces than it does now. If the Soviet Union wanted to attack the West, then, according to those who believe that attacks must be carried out at the most advantageous moment for themselves, the Soviet Union should have attacked the West at that time. But the Soviet Union did not do this. Why? Because the Soviet Union is a peaceful country, because the Soviet people are against war, but if someone attacks the Soviet Union, they will rise up to defend their motherland, and there is no doubt that they will use every necessary means to destroy the invaders. That is the lesson of history.

	As for the Lend-Lease Act, it cannot be denied that this Lend-Lease Act played a major role during the war. It is wrong to deny this. But Khrushchev reminded his visitors that the Soviet Union paid for this Lend-Lease Act with blood. The blood shed by the Soviet people in the struggle for the common cause cannot be bought with gold or commodities. The Soviets can say to their former American friends who fought alongside them against Hitler's Germany: The Soviets fought selflessly and faithfully against the common enemy and won the victory.

	As for the "Marshall Plan," much has been said about it before. The Soviets believed in the past, and still believe now, that the "Marshall Plan" had its political purpose, that it was an attempt to use material aid as a guise to establish control over other countries, to bring these countries to submission. If this could be used against Greece or some other country, then the Soviet Union has never and will never sell its independence for sausage or any other commodity.

	Now let's talk about the peaceful coexistence of the capitalist system and the socialist system. The question of coexistence is, of course, a big question. In our era, the very fact that there is, on the one hand, capitalist America, capitalist Britain and some other capitalist countries, and on the other hand, the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and other people's democratic countries that manage their national economies according to socialist principles, speaks for itself. N.S. Khrushchev pointed out that we all live on one Earth, and we cannot run away to another place.

	You oppose communism and socialism, and we oppose capitalism. We build and develop our economy according to socialist principles. You are willing to build the economy according to capitalist principles. On this point, we have said before and we say now: Build to your satisfaction, but do not hinder us. The situation has formed that two systems exist in the world at the same time. You may think this is God's will. We, on the other hand, believe that this is the result of historical development. You believe that capitalism is unshakable and that the future belongs to the capitalist system. We, on the other hand, believe that communism is invincible and that the future belongs to the communist system. These are two completely opposing views.

	What is the way out of this situation? Some fanatics believe that the way out is war. But this is a stupid way out. We follow the legacy of the great Lenin and advocate the long-term peaceful coexistence of the two systems, that is to say, we have always believed that the two systems can coexist without fighting.

	If we ask how long this peaceful coexistence can last, it should be pointed out that this will depend on historical conditions and historical development. The Soviets believe that one country cannot force another country to accept its national system. If the American people prefer to live under capitalist conditions, then let them do so, and no one will interfere with them. Khrushchev said, I, as a Communist, sympathize with the Communists. My interlocutors sympathize with the capitalists, and they are capitalists themselves. Nevertheless, we are conducting a calm conversation. If this can be done at this table, then he, Khrushchev, believed that it can also be done in the relationship between the capitalist and socialist systems.

	Hearst pointed out that in diplomatic settings, the Soviet Union and the United States have been coexisting in the United Nations.

	N.S. Khrushchev agreed with this and went on to say that, of course, his interlocutors believe that capitalism will triumph. The Soviets, on the other hand, believe that communism will triumph. When will we see the outcome, we do not know. As for the future development of the United States, this will depend on the American people themselves, and no one can solve this problem for the American people. Tsar Nicholas II probably thought ten years before the October Revolution that his throne was unshakable and would last forever. However, after ten years, it disappeared without a trace, and it was not the Americans, but the Russian workers and peasants who overthrew the Russian Tsarist system. Who knows what will happen in other countries, such as the United States. There is a powerful working class in the United States, and they will sooner or later make their voices heard. But the solution to the question of which system will triumph in the United States depends on the American people, and only on the American people.

	He, Khrushchev, felt that the American politicians understood all this very well, but they misinterpreted the principle of coexistence in order to stir up anti-Soviet sentiment among the American people, in order to make them believe that the Soviet Union wants war. This is a slander against the Soviet Union. The Soviet people advocate the long-term coexistence of the two systems.

	Kingsbury Smith pointed out that American business owners believe that the American working class often makes its voice heard, demanding higher wages.

	Hearst added that the workers make their demands in every strike.

	N.S. Khrushchev said, of course, this is the internal affair of the American people.

	Hearst said that since N.S. Khrushchev had spoken of the need to let the American people solve this problem themselves, he, Hearst, was willing to point out that it was the American people who had the opportunity to solve this problem in every election. And regarding the Russian people, Hearst also hoped to say the same thing, that is to say, the issue of the Soviet Union's internal system should be solved by the Russian people themselves. Of course, he, Hearst, would not dare to predict what the final solution would be.

	Conniff asked: Since N.S. Khrushchev had been to Beijing and had contact with the leaders of the Chinese government, could he talk about his views on the prospects for maintaining peace in the Far East.

	N.S. Khrushchev replied: The way this question is phrased makes it necessary for him to speak on behalf of the Chinese government in order to answer this question, which would violate the agreement he and his interlocutors have already reached, that the people of each country must express their opinions on their own behalf. Therefore, he can only express his personal opinion, taking into account that the Chinese leaders are clear-headed, that they are good at managing the country and making correct decisions. It should be remembered that the leaders of People's China undertook thirty years of war against domestic reactionaries, against Japan, and against other imperialists. The Chinese people have shown by their actions that they wholeheartedly support the Communist leaders of the new China.

	N.S. Khrushchev continued that he knew who he was talking to, but he had to say that he could not understand America's current actions, nor could he find any justification for these actions. Declaring Taiwan and other islands belonging to China not to be Chinese territory is a violation of existing international agreements and historical facts. This can only be described as an act of treachery. Would China recognize that the United States has the right to covet Taiwan or agree that Taiwan is necessary for American defense? If you look at the distance between mainland China and Taiwan and the distance between the United States and Taiwan, it is obvious that the difference in numbers is incomparable. In Khrushchev's view, America's current actions in the Taiwan area are a shameful page in the history of the American people. Anyone who is sane, regardless of their political views, would never consider the disputes provoked by American policy to be justified. As for how the situation in this region will develop in the future, it will depend on America itself. Would China recognize that the United States or its puppet—the rogue Chiang Kai-shek—has the right to Taiwan? At this point, N.S. Khrushchev said that Chiang Kai-shek reminded him of the puppet emperor Pu Yi whom the Japanese had installed in Manchukuo.

	N.S. Khrushchev continued that the actions of the American government surprised the Soviets. The Soviets know and respect Eisenhower because he was their partner in the war against Hitler. They do not understand the policy adopted by the United States on the Taiwan issue, and they believe that the American people themselves may not understand this policy either. The United States, apparently under the influence of the most reactionary groups, is taking unprecedented actions in the Far East and is artificially escalating the situation.

	On this issue, if the United States makes sober considerations—as for China's sober ideas, Khrushchev has no doubts—then, with the participation of other countries concerned with maintaining peace, conflicts in the Far East can still be prevented.

	Kingsbury Smith asked if it could be assumed that the other countries referred to by Khrushchev also included the Soviet Union.

	Khrushchev replied that this was no exception. The Soviet Union is concerned with maintaining peace. It is prepared to do everything in its power to promote a correct solution to the problem and prevent a new war.

	Kingsbury Smith said that, as he saw it, neither the American government nor the American people doubted that Formosa itself was a part of China. Molotov had already said when he spoke with him and Hearst that in 1950, the American president had once again stated that the United States considered Formosa to belong to China. But now a problem has arisen, according to the opinion of American leaders (Kingsbury Smith believes that the American people understand the attitude of the American leaders), this is a question of the security of the entire Pacific and world peace. On this point, Kingsbury Smith recounted that the United States had previously withdrawn its troops from Korea for the sake of peace. But after a not too long period of time, war broke out there, and this war finally created a threat to peace throughout the Far East and even to world peace. Therefore, the United States would not be inclined to withdraw its protection of Formosa until it believes that peace is guaranteed, although the United States is unwilling to cause China to lose Taiwan or any other territory. This is the reason for the current policy of the United States. Kingsbury Smith went on to say that he and his companions were very grateful to Khrushchev for frankly exchanging opinions with them, and they believed that such an exchange of opinions would only help to clarify each other's attitudes.

	Hearst also expressed his gratitude for this friendly and frank conversation.

	Khrushchev said that he would like to talk further, that he was very clear about what kind of policy the American ruling group was pursuing towards the People's Republic of China. He believed that this policy was unwise and short-sighted. It seems that the people who formulated this policy did not proceed from common sense, but from feelings of hostility towards the Chinese people. This is very similar to the situation in which a person runs into someone else's home with a weapon and says that if the owner wants to drive him out, then there can be no understanding between them, and there will be a danger of war. Needless to say, China will not be intimidated by this threat. China is a great and proud country, and the Chinese people will not bow to anyone, will not yield to extortion. Khrushchev said that this was certainly not his business, but he believed that if the United States were in the same situation, it would also refuse to be as obsequious as China was being asked to be. In such a situation, the United States would be right, just as the Chinese are right today.

	Khrushchev said that if we talk about the past, then it should be pointed out that he believed that there had also been a blatant interference in the civil war in Korea, which had not helped the United States increase its prestige. Fortunately, the Korean War is over, the flames of war have been extinguished there, and the Soviet Union does not want this kind of war to happen anywhere again.

	Khrushchev went on to say that he and his interlocutors, like him, were satisfied with this meeting and expressed their gratitude for this frank conversation. Khrushchev said that we belong to different classes, but I think we, as human beings, should have something in common—and that is the interests of peace. If we manage to reach an understanding, to ease international tensions, and to create normal conditions for coexistence, then it will promote the consolidation of world peace.

	Hearst said that he had nothing more to say, that he thanked him for the conversation and asked for forgiveness that he had taken up so much of Khrushchev's time.

	Hearst said that he would also like to say that, not for the purpose of propaganda, nor to raise a question, he believed that Khrushchev should not proceed from the hypothesis that Americans hate the Chinese people, as this is an incorrect starting point. On the contrary, in the last war, the American and Chinese people fought side by side, and in the past the United States had helped China more than once. If we are to talk about the American people's feelings towards the Chinese people, then it should not be described as feelings of hatred, but feelings of the best goodwill.

	Kingsbury Smith said that the American people were, of course, disturbed by the incident of the American pilots who had been sentenced to imprisonment in China. Americans believed that this was a violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement, and this incident undoubtedly aroused feelings of ill will towards the Chinese people among the American people.

	Conniff asked if, in Khrushchev's view, there was any possibility of resolving the issue of the American pilots, since even the Soviet representative to the United Nations admitted that these American pilots were captured wearing military uniforms. An expression like releasing these pilots could be the first step in changing the situation.

	Khrushchev pointed out that he would like to answer the claim of goodwill towards the Chinese people first. He said that the problem is that the Chinese people judge others' attitudes towards them not on the basis of words, but on the basis of actions, and America's actions are threatening China with war. How can these actions be confused with goodwill? Perhaps, this refers to several different Chinas; when some Americans talk about China, they are obviously referring to Chiang Kai-shek. But Chiang Kai-shek is not China, but China's trash. In fact, the American ruling group should calmly look at the facts before them, and then they will eventually see the real China—the People's Republic of China, and the government of the People's Republic of China headed by Mao Zedong. The United States should withdraw its troops from Chinese territory, which will definitely help establish normal relations between China and the United States.

	As for the issue of the pilots, Khrushchev said that it was difficult for him to say anything on this issue. United Nations Secretary-General Hammarskjold had specially flown to Beijing to consult on this issue, and obviously, he would be better than Khrushchev at stating the views of the People's Republic of China, because Khrushchev had not studied this matter with the Chinese leaders. N.S. Khrushchev said that he could understand the feelings of the compatriots of these pilots. However, this matter involves the issue of jurisdiction and national law. Therefore, Khrushchev believed that if the Americans could show a healthier view, if the Americans recognized the legal rights of the Chinese state, then this issue could be properly resolved as soon as possible. He, Khrushchev, emphasized again that he could, of course, only express his personal opinion, and he believed that the issue of the pilots was not an unresolvable entanglement. What is involved here is the issue of a country's sovereignty, and the American government should understand this.

	Kingsbury Smith said that he would like to offer one last informal, perhaps impolite, opinion. There have been many comments in the Western newspapers, such as in the London "Times," about disagreements between N.S. Khrushchev and G.M. Malenkov. However, when he, Kingsbury Smith, and his friends attended the Supreme Soviet meeting and saw N.S. Khrushchev and G.M. Malenkov sitting together and talking cordially, they concluded that these comments were unfounded.

	N.S. Khrushchev replied that these newspapers may be taking their wishes as facts.

	Kingsbury Smith asked if they could consider themselves entitled to quote N.S. Khrushchev's reply. N.S. Khrushchev replied that this was up to them. N.S. Khrushchev finally joked that if Hearst was summoned by the McCarthy Committee after returning to the United States, then he, Khrushchev, could testify that Hearst had actively defended the interests of his government in the conversation.

    赫鲁晓夫同美国记者谈话
    【新华社讯】塔斯社莫斯科十日电：尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫二月五日接见了美国记者威·伦·赫斯特，金斯伯里·史密斯和佛·康尼夫。下面是谈话的情形。
    金斯伯里·史密斯说，赫斯特和他的同伴们知道，由于最高苏维埃会议，赫鲁晓夫很忙，因此他们很感谢他能抽出时间来接见他们。金斯伯里·史密斯接着说，他们大家都以很大的兴趣注意到赫鲁晓夫最近在苏联共产党中央委员会全体会议上发表的演说中对美国农作方法所说的好话，特别是他所说的关于这些方法可以作为苏联农业的良好范例的话。在这方面，赫斯特想向赫鲁晓夫提出一个问题。
    赫斯特说，当他读到赫鲁晓夫对于美国种植玉蜀黍和谷物的方法的良好评价时，他想到如果苏联人民比较经常地注重美国生活中的好的方面，而美国人比较经常地注重苏联生活中的好的方面，那样就会好些。但是，目前他们彼此批评得太多而考虑积极方面的事实太少了。
    赫斯特问赫鲁晓夫是否同意。
    赫鲁晓夫回答说，他同意，并且认为这样将会是很有益处的。在他看来，美国有许多好的东西。他认为美国人也会发现苏联有许多使他们感兴趣的而且对他们有用处的东西。这不仅适用于农业，而且适用于工业和其他方面。
    赫斯特说，由于赫鲁晓夫对美国生活的某些方面作了良好的评价，他想表示希望赫鲁晓夫有可能在某一天访问美国（就像他——赫斯特——和他的同伴们有机会访问苏联一样），以便亲自看看美国的农业和工业等等，因为据了解，赫鲁晓夫从未到过美国。
    赫鲁晓夫证实，他的确从未到过美国。
    金斯伯里·史密斯问赫鲁晓夫是否准备访问美国了解一下美国的农作方法，特别是在畜牧业方面的方法，如果他接到邀请，请他在方便时到美国去的话。
    赫鲁晓夫回答说，他希望一并答复赫斯特和金斯伯里·史密斯的问题。他认为，如果不存偏见，彼此到对方国家去访问，对人民总是有好处的。在他看来，苏联人访问美国，不论从经济观点来看和在增进相互了解方面，都是有益处的。米高扬到过美国，他谈到了他在那里所看到的许多有趣的和值得称道的事情。
    金斯伯里·史密斯说，维·米·莫洛托夫也到过美国。
    赫鲁晓夫回答说，莫洛托夫在战时以及在战争结束后不久曾到过美国。他没有机会像米高扬那样详细地了解那个国家。
    至于他，赫鲁晓夫，到美国去，那在目前当然是很困难的，虽然，如他已说过的，他认为在美国有许多有趣和有益的东西，譬如说在农业和农业机器制造业方面。至于农业组织，同他谈话的人对集体农庄制度当然不感兴趣，而苏联人也不会为美国的农业组织原则所吸引。但是，这并不妨碍他们看看美国在牲畜饲养、农业机器制造业等方面的好的地方。何况也应该说，美国的农业经营得非常经济，劳动力有大量的节省。
    考虑到他，赫鲁晓夫，作为苏联共产党中央委员会书记的地位，美国甚至一个有影响的人也不会冒昧地邀请他。那样一来，在美国不会有人说他是想来破坏美国制度吗？在这方面，赫鲁晓夫开玩笑说，他担心赫斯特会因为他跟苏联共产党中央委员会书记谈话而不得不到麦卡锡委员会去。
    至于他，赫鲁晓夫，的美国之行，那要取决于许多问题。在目前，美国人不仅不会对像他那样的人发给签证，甚至也不会对普通的苏联学生报纸编辑发给签证，这似乎是很奇怪的事。
    赫斯特说，他和他的同伴们非常注意苏联政府所作的再度着重发展重工业的决定。这究竟是意味着又认为有必要更加注意增加国防的潜力呢，还是意味着新纲领目的在于扩充生产资料以便随后生产消费品呢？
    赫鲁晓夫回答说，很明显，苏联政府关于更大规模地扩展消费品生产的措施在国外是被误解的，有人认为这样做就是要缩减发展重工业的工作。赫鲁晓夫说，我们过去一向认为，现在和将来仍然认为，一切工业部门都必须按比例发展，而重工业的发展要超过其他工业的发展。为什么必须这样呢？因为重工业是制造生产资料的，而为了提高生活水平，就必须提高生产力，就必须实行机械化。但是如果没有金属、机器和电力，就不可能实行机械化。因此重工业是发展国民经济的基础。
    举个例说，最近一次苏共中央全体会议通过了进一步发展畜牧业的决议。畜牧业是什么呢？这在实质上就是消费品的生产。但是，如果不发展供给农业以拖拉机、农业机器等等的重工业，要发展畜牧业是不可能的。因此可以说，如果整个国民经济是各个经济部门的综合体，那么重工业应当在这个综合体中占主导的地位。
    至于发展重工业究竟是为了国防，或者是为了和平需要这个问题，赫鲁晓夫认为，在苏联，这两者是并不矛盾的。赫鲁晓夫说，我们是共产党人，对我们说来，把钱花在国防上面是不得已的事情。我们希望最好有可能不把人民的钱花在国防上面。赫鲁晓夫说，他相信这种可能性总有一天会出现的。但是，目前的国际局势迫使苏联把一部分钱花在国防上面。美国人认为，苏联是目前国际紧张局势的罪人。而苏联人却认为，这是美国的罪过，因为美国在靠近苏联国境的周围建筑自己的军事基地，并且想凭着“实力地位”来和苏联打交道，邱吉尔这样说过，杜勒斯和其他的人也常常重复这种说法。不管怎样，在目前的条件下，苏联不得不把自己的一部分财力和人力用来加强国家的防御力量。赫鲁晓夫继续说，但是我们的主要目的是要使我国人民幸福，提高人民的生活水平。同时我们还希望，不仅我国人民，而且其他国家的人民也都幸福。最终的目的不应当是制造更多的大炮和原子弹——这是当前存在的不正常的国际关系的结果。不能认为大炮和炸弹是国家的财富。应该说，这些东西妨碍了人民生活水平提高的可能。
    金斯伯里·史密斯感谢赫鲁晓夫的回答。
    赫鲁晓夫说，他想再补充谈一谈他刚才关于
  “实力地位”政策的意见。赫鲁晓夫认为，这是一种十分危险的政策。它所以危险，是因为无论这一方或另一方都要增强自己的实力，企图使自己比对方更强。这样就会使战争的工具愈积愈多。每当在军备方面积累了大量物资后备的时候，这就总是包藏着爆发战争的危险。
    国与国之间的关系不应当建立在“实力地位”政策的基础上，而建立在互相谅解的基础上。为此，首先就需要在互利的条件下，发展正常的贸易。为此，就应当不威胁别的国家。必须要那些拿原子弹吓人的疯子放规矩一些。这就会使各国人民得到安宁。
    苏联正在努力同别的国家发展正常的事务和贸易关系，以便使这种正常关系得到巩固，变成友好的关系。苏联没有和美国争执的问题。苏联人对美国人民有着友好的感情。如果美国政府想从苏联这里得到什么，那么可以肯定，美国政府要用勒索和威胁的办法，是什么也得不到的。威胁和讹诈是不会有什么结果的，因为苏联从来不曾而且今后也不会向威胁让步。如果美国政府希望从苏联这里得到什么，那么只有在正常关系的基础上，在正常贸易的基础上，才能得到。
    赫鲁晓夫相信，改善我们两国之间的关系的力量是会有的，健康的理智是会占优势的。至于他本人，他主张正常的关系，主张正常的贸易，主张发展苏美两国间的贸易。
    金斯伯里·史密斯说，美国领袖们认为，他们曾经站在他们认为是较弱的地位上企图和苏联取得谅解，然而他们发现这是不可能的。也许，正因为这样，他们才觉得如果希望要同苏联解决问题，西方首先必须取得美国领袖们所认为的那种平等或者近于均势的地位。
    美国在战争之后就立即裁减军备了。然而，美国领袖们根据他们所拥有的情报来看，有理由认为，苏联并没有以同样的速度裁减军备。赫斯特说，美国在战时表现了善意，例如在租借法案上，又例如它曾经建议苏联和各人民民主国家利用马歇尔计划的好处。
    金斯伯里·史密斯继续说，他以为，美国领袖们没有打算把自己的意志强加于苏联，也没有打算向苏联勒索什么东西。他们最希望和苏联保持和平和友好的关系。
    赫斯特接着说，无论在美国宪法中，或者在美国杰出领袖和思想家的著作中，都没有任何类似列宁和马克思这种学说的说法，即所谓两个制度不能相容，所谓其中的一个制度一定会灭亡的学说。这是使美国人感到不安的问题之一，因为他们认为苏联的长远计划就是这个学说的反映。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫指出，实力地位和软弱地位，这当然是两回事。苏联人民承认，任何国家都有权利而且应该考虑自己的安全，并建立足以保障自身安全的武装部队。而这也就是金斯伯里·史密斯所谈到的均势。然而，邱吉尔以及后来杜勒斯却提出了实行“实力地位”政策的口号。这意思就是说，一方希望把自己的意志强加于另一方，希望比另一方强有力。这样的政策孕育着严重的危险。如果一方不断加强自己的力量，那么，另一方也不得不同样这样作。这就只能使得气氛越加白热化。赫鲁晓夫认为，“实力地位”政策是一个很不好的政策，因为这里面蕴藏着发动新战争的危险。
    有人说，美国在战后已经复员了，而苏联却没有这样做，关于这一点，赫鲁晓夫首先指出，在过去一次战争中，美国只损失了几十万人，而苏联却损失了几百万人。这说明了什么问题呢？这说明在战争期间整个苏联、整个国家都动员起来了。战争结束后苏联的武装部队已经复员了。剩下来的都是为国家安全所必需的。
    如果从事实出发，那么事实并不证实赫斯特的以及其他西方人士常常谈到的说法，即认为苏联保持了比西方更多的军队，认为这支军队形成了威胁。
    苏联不愿意做有害于反希特勒斗争中的盟国的事。大家知道，五年以前，美国动员的力量比现在要少。假如苏联是想进攻西方的话，那么，根据那些认为必须在对自己最有利的时刻实行进攻的人的看法，苏联应当在那个时候就进攻西方。但是，苏联并没有这样做。为什么呢？因为苏联是一个和平的国家，因为苏联人是反对战争的，可是，如果一旦有人进攻苏联，他们是会起来保卫祖国的，而且可以不必怀疑，他们会尽一切必要的力量，来歼灭侵犯者。历史的教训就是这样的。
    至于谈到租借法案问题，不能否认，这一租借法案在战争期间起有很大的帮助作用。否认这一点是不对的。但是赫鲁晓夫提醒他的访问者说，苏联是用鲜血来换取这项租借法案的。苏联人民在为了共同事业的斗争中所流的血，绝不是黄金也不是商品所能买得来的。苏联人可以对曾经一起同希特勒德国作战的旧日美国朋友说：苏联人曾奋不顾身地、忠实地对共同的敌人进行战斗，并且赢得了胜利。
    至于“马歇尔计划”，以前已经谈得很多了。苏联人过去认为，现在也还认为“马歇尔计划”是有它的政治目的的，它是企图用物质援助为幌子来建立对其他国家的控制，来使这些国家就范。如果说这可以用来对付希腊或是某个其他国家的话，那么苏联从来不曾而且也永远不会为了腊肠或是其他什么商品而出卖自己的独立。
    现在谈到资本主义制度和社会主义制度和平共处的问题。共处的问题，当然是个大问题。在我们的时代中，一方面存在着资本主义的美国、资本主义的英国和其他一些资本主义国家，另一方面存在着根据社会主义原则来管理国民经济的苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家，这一事实本身就说明了问题。尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫指出，我们大家都生活在一个地球上，我们跑不到别处去。
    你们反对共产主义和社会主义，我们反对资本主义。我们根据社会主义的原则建设和发展我们的经济。你们愿意根据资本主义的原则建设经济。关于这一点，我们从前和现在都这样说：祝你们满意地建设吧，但是不要妨碍我们。已经形成了这样的局面：世界上同时存在着两种制度。你们也许认为这是神的意志。我们却认为，这是历史发展的结果。你们认为资本主义是不可动摇的，未来属于资本主义制度。而我们却认为，共产主义是不可战胜的，未来属于共产主义制度。这是两种完全对立的看法。
    这种局面的出路何在呢？有些过分狂热的人认为出路在于战争。但是，这是愚蠢的出路。我们遵循伟大的列宁的遗训，主张两种制度长期和平共处，也就是说，我们以前和现在都认为，这两种制度可以共处而不作战。
    如果问，这种和平共处可以为时多久，那么应当指出，这将看历史条件、历史发展而定。苏联人认为，一国不能强迫另一国接受它的国家制度。如果美国人民宁愿在资本主义条件下生活，那就让他们这样吧，谁也不会去干涉他们这样做。赫鲁晓夫说，我，作为一个共产党人，是同情共产党人的。我的交谈者是同情资本家的，而且他们自己就是资本家。虽然如此，我们却进行着心平气和的交谈。如果在这张桌子上可以这样做的话，那么，他，赫鲁晓夫，认为，在资本主义和社会主义两种制度之间的关系上也可以这样做。
    赫斯特指出，在外交场合，苏联和美国一直在联合国中共同相处。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同意这一点，并且接着说道，当然，他的交谈者认为，资本主义会胜利。苏联人却认为，共产主义会胜利。何时见分晓，还不知道。至于美国未来的发展，这将取决于美国人民自己，谁也不能替美国人民解决这个问题。沙皇尼古拉二世在十月革命前的十年当中大概认为，他的王位是不可动摇的，它将永远存留不去。然而，过了十年，它连一点痕迹都没有了，而且，不是美国的，正是俄国的工人和农民推翻了俄国沙皇制度。谁又知道，在其他国家，例如在美国，将会发生什么事呢。在美国有着强大的工人阶级，他们早晚会发出自己的呼声。但是解决怎样的制度将在美国胜利这样的问题，那就有赖于美国人民，而且也仅仅有赖于美国人民。
    他，赫鲁晓夫，觉得，美国的政治家们对这一切了解得非常清楚，但是他们对共处的原则做了不正确的解释，为的是煽动美国人反对苏联的情绪，为的是叫他们相信，苏联要战争。这是对苏联的诽谤。苏联人民是主张两种制度长期共处的。
    金斯伯里·史密斯指出，美国的企业主认为，美国工人阶级往往发出自己的呼声，要求提高工资。
    赫斯特补充说，工人们在每次罢工中都提出他们的要求。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫说，当然，这是美国人民的内政。
    赫斯特说，由于尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫谈到必须让美国人民自己来解决这个问题，他，赫斯特，愿意指出，正是美国人民有机会在每次选举中解决这个问题。而关于俄国人民，赫斯特也希望说同样的话，就是说，关于苏联内部制度的问题应当由俄国人民自己来解决。当然，他，赫斯特，不敢预言，最后的解决会是怎样的。
    康尼夫问道：尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫既然到过北京，并且和中国政府的领袖有过交往，那么他是否可以谈谈，他对维护远东和平的前景有怎样的看法。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫回答说：这个问题这样的提法，使得他要回答这个问题就势必代替中国政府讲话，而这就将违背他和他的交谈者所已经取得的协议，即每个国家的人民必须代表自己发表意见。因此，他只能表示他个人的意见，他考虑到中国领导者的头脑是清醒的，他们是善于管理国家和采取正确的决定的。应当记住，人民中国的领导者承担了三十年的反对国内的反动势力、反对日本以及其他帝国主义者的战争。中国人民用事实表明了，他们是衷心拥护新中国的共产党领导者的。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫继续说，他知道他在跟谁谈话，然而，他必须说，他不能理解美国现在的行动，也不能给这些行动找到任何理由。宣布台湾和属于中国的其他岛屿不是中国的领土，是违背现有的国际协定和历史事实的。这只能说是背信弃义的行为。难道中国会承认美国有觊觎台湾的权利或者会同意台湾是美国的防卫所必需的吗？如果看一看中国大陆和台湾的距离以及美国和台湾的距离，显而易见，相差的数字是不可比拟的。据赫鲁晓夫看来，美国目前在台湾地区的行动是美国人民的耻辱的一页。凡是思想健全的人，不管他们的政治观点如何，绝不会认为美国的政策所挑起的纠纷是合理的。至于这个地区的局面将来如何发展，这就要看美国自己了。难道中国会承认美国或者它的傀儡——流氓蒋介石有对台湾的权利吗？谈到这里，尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫说，蒋介石使他想起当年日本人在满洲国扶植的傀儡皇帝溥仪来。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫继续说，美国政府的行动使苏联人惊讶。苏联人知道并且尊重艾森豪威尔，因为他是他们对希特勒战争中的伙伴。他们不理解美国在台湾问题上采取的政策，而且他们认为，美国人民自己也未必理解这个政策。美国，显然是在最反动的集团的影响下，在远东采取着没有先例的行动，并且在人为地使局势紧张。
    在这个问题上，如果美国作清醒的考虑——至于中国抱有清醒的想法一点，赫鲁晓夫是不怀疑的，那么，在其他关心维护和平的国家的参加下，还可以阻止远东的冲突。
    金斯伯里·史密斯问道，可不可以认为，赫鲁晓夫所指的其他国家也包括苏联在内。
    赫鲁晓夫回答说，这也不例外。苏联是关心维护和平的。它准备尽其所能来促进问题的正确解决和防止新战争。
    金斯伯里·史密斯说，据他看，无论是美国政府或美国人民，都不怀疑福摩萨本身是中国的一部。莫洛托夫在同他和赫斯特谈话的时候已经说过：一九五零年美国总统曾经再一次表示，美国认为福摩萨是属于中国的。但是现在产生了一个问题，据美国领导人物的意见（金斯伯里·史密斯认为，美国人民是理解美国领导人的态度的），这是一个有关整个太平洋的安全和世界和平的问题。金斯伯里·史密斯就这一点追述说，美国以前也曾经为了和平而把自己的军队撤出了朝鲜。但是过了一段不算太长的时间，那里爆发了战争，而且这场战争终于造成了对整个远东和平、甚至对全世界和平的威胁。因此，美国不会倾向于在它认为和平有了保障之前撤消自己对福摩萨的保护，虽然美国是不愿意使中国失去台湾或任何其他的领土的。美国现行政策的原因也就在这里。金斯伯里·史密斯接着说，他和他的同伴非常感谢赫鲁晓夫和他们坦白地交换意见，他们认为，这样的交换意见是只会有助于澄清彼此的态度的。
    赫斯特也表示感谢这种友好和坦白的谈话。
    赫鲁晓夫说，他想再谈谈，他很清楚地知道，美国统治集团正在对中华人民共和国奉行着什么样的政策。他认为，这种政策是不明智的，是没有远见的。看来，制订这种政策的人不是从常识出发，而是从仇视中国人民的感情出发。这很像这样一种情况：一个人拿着武器跑到别人的家里，并且说，如果主人要把他赶出去，那么他们之间就不能谅解，而且会产生战争的危险。不用说，中国是不会为这种威胁所吓倒的。中国是一个伟大的、自豪的国家，中国人民不会向任何人低头，不会向讹诈屈膝。赫鲁晓夫说这当然不是他的事，但是他相信，如果美国处于同样的境况，它也会拒绝像要求中国做的那样卑躬屈膝。在这样的情况之下，美国会是对的，正如今天中国人是对的一样。
    赫鲁晓夫说，如果谈起过去，那么就应当指出，他认为，在朝鲜也曾发生过粗暴地干涉内战的事情，这种干涉没有帮助美国提高威信。幸好朝鲜战争已经结束了，那里的战火已经扑灭了，而且，苏联不希望在任何地方再发生这种战争。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，他和他的交谈者一样，对这次会谈感到满意，对这次坦率的交谈表示感谢。赫鲁晓夫说，我们是属于不同阶级的人，但是我想，我们，作为人，就应当有共同之点——这就是和平的利益。如果我们设法取得谅解，设法缓和国际紧张局势，创造正常的共处的条件，那么，就会促进世界和平的巩固。
    赫斯特说，他没有什么要说的了，他感谢这次交谈，并请求原谅，他耽误了赫鲁晓夫许多时间。
    赫斯特说，他还想说一下，不是为了宣传的目的，也不是提出一个问题，他认为赫鲁晓夫不要从美国人仇视中国人民这一假说出发，这是一个不正确的出发点。相反地，在上次战争中，美国人和中国人民曾经并肩作过战，在过去美国曾不止一次地帮助过中国。如果要说到美国人对中国人民的感情，那么不应当说成是仇恨的感情，而是最善意的感情。
    金斯伯里·史密斯说，美国人民对在中国被判处徒刑的美国飞行员的事件，当然感到不安。美国人认为这是违反朝鲜停战协定的，这个事件无疑在美国人民当中引起了对中国人的不善意的感情。
      康尼夫问道，依赫鲁晓夫看来，是否有解决关于美国飞行员的问题的某种可能呢，甚至苏联驻联合国的代表也承认，这些美国飞行员是穿着军装被捕获的。像释放这些飞行员这样的表示，可能成为改变局势的第一个步骤。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，他想首先回答关于对中国人民的善意的说法。他说，问题在于，中国人民不是根据言论，而是根据行动来判断别人对他们的态度的，而美国的行动则是用战争在威胁中国。怎么可以把这种行动和善意混为一谈呢？或许，这里指的是几个不同的中国，当某些美国人谈到中国时，显然他们指的是蒋介石。但是，蒋介石不是中国，而是中国的垃圾。其实，美国统治集团应当冷静地看看眼前的事实，那么最后总会看到真正的中国——中华人民共和国，看到以毛泽东为首的中华人民共和国政府。美国应当从中国领土上撤退自己的军队，这样一定会有助于建立中美之间的正常关系。
    至于飞行员的问题，赫鲁晓夫说他很难就这一问题说些什么。联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德曾经特地飞往北京去磋商过这个问题，显然，他会比赫鲁晓夫更好地陈述中华人民共和国的观点，因为赫鲁晓夫并没有同中国领袖们研究过这件事。尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫说，他是可以理解到这些飞行员的同国人的感情的。但是，这件事牵涉到审判权和国家法律的问题。因此，赫鲁晓夫认为，如果美国人能表现更健康的见解，如果美国人承认中国国家的法律权利，那么这一问题是可以尽快地求得妥善解决的。他，赫鲁晓夫，再一次强调说，他当然只能表示他个人的意见，而他认为，关于飞行员的问题，并不是一个不能解决的纠葛。这里牵涉到的是一个国家的主权的问题，美国政府应该理解到这一点。
    金斯伯里·史密斯说，他最后想提出一点非正式的、也许是不礼貌的意见。在西方报纸上，例如在伦敦的“泰晤士报”上有不少关于尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫和格·马·马林科夫之间发生分歧的言论。然而当他，金斯伯里·史密斯和他的朋友们参加了最高苏维埃会议，并且看见了尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫同格·马·马林科夫坐在一起并亲切地谈话这种情况后，他们就得出结论，这些言论都是没有根据的。
    尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫答道，这些报纸可能在把他们的愿望当做事实看待。
    金斯伯里·史密斯问道，他们是否可以认为自己有权利来引用尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫回答的话。尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫答道，这在于他们自己。尼·谢·赫鲁晓夫最后开玩笑地说，如果赫斯特回到美国之后被麦卡锡委员会传讯，那么他，赫鲁晓夫可以作证：赫斯特在谈话中是曾经积极维护自己政府的利益的。
