Economic Departments in Shandong, Guangdong, Qinghai and Other Provinces
Transfer Production Materials to Supply Farmers for Spring Plowing

[By Our Newspaper] Shandong, Guangdong, Qinghai, Shanxi, Hunan, Zhejiang, Fujian and Jiangsu provinces are actively transferring large quantities of production materials to supply farmers' needs for spring plowing.

At present, many new-style farm tools have been successively transported to various places. The Shandong Provincial People's Government and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative supplied farmers with 20,000 light double-wheeled double-shared plows and 1,000 medium-sized double-wheeled single-shared plows for spring plowing. 7,140 units shipped to the cotton-producing areas on both sides of the lower reaches of the Yellow River and Yinan, Haiyang, Rongcheng, Kunlun and other counties have begun to be distributed to agricultural production cooperatives that have pre-ordered them, and they are being taught the technology of using new-style farm tools. In January, the Guangdong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative allocated 10,000 "May 1st" style paddy field plows (including more than 3,000 parts) and more than 500 double-wheeled double-shared plows to agricultural production cooperatives in various parts of the province. This year, the total operating volume of production materials of the Guangdong Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative will increase by about 34% compared with last year. The Qinghai Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative recently transported more than 470 double-wheeled double-shared plows and various improved walking plows from Beijing, Xi'an and other places to supply farmers of all ethnic groups in preparation for spring plowing.

Various places have prepared a large number of improved varieties for spring sowing. In order to expand the cotton field area, fourteen counties in Linfen County and Yuci Special Zone, Shanxi Province, have stored more than 4.22 million jin of high-quality cotton seeds. Yangqu County and other four farms have prepared 120,000 jin of Golden Queen corn improved varieties. The 800,000 jin of fiber flax improved varieties ordered by the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Agricultural Department from the Northeast region and the 120,000 jin of flax seeds ordered from Shangyi County, Hebei Province, will soon be transported back. The Hunan Provincial People's Government Grain Department and Agricultural Department plan to supply farmers in the Bin Hu area with more than 38 million jin of early, mid and late rice seeds, and 13 million jin of early rice improved varieties have been transported to the Bin Hu area. More than 5 million jin of high-quality cotton seeds and a large number of jute seeds purchased from Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other provinces have also begun to be transferred to various places. Zhejiang Province supported Hubei and Anhui provinces, which had suffered from natural disasters, and Jiangxi Province with 39 million jin of rice seeds to help farmers carry out spring sowing. Among them, 18 million jin of early and late indica rice seeds supporting Hubei have been successively shipped out, and rice seeds supporting Anhui and Jiangxi will be transported to their destinations before the end of February.

In addition, various places have also transferred many pesticides and fertilizers to supply farmers for spring plowing. The activities of various economic departments in Fujian Province to support farmers' spring plowing production have already begun. The Fujian Provincial Cooperative General Society is transporting tens of thousands of tons of chemical fertilizers, cake fertilizer, pesticides and a large number of sprayers and double-wheeled double-shared plows to rural areas. Every day, more than 3,000 wooden sailboats and dozens of cargo ships on the Minjiang River transport grain from the mountainous areas and transport various production materials to the farmers in the mountainous areas. Spring plowing in Longxi Special Zone, Fujian Province, started earlier, and supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties have supplied farmers with fertilizers purchased locally. The Jiangsu Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative is transferring a large number of "666" pesticide powder to rural areas to supply farmers in dryland areas to prevent and control underground pests. The Jiangsu Provincial People's Government Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Supply and Marketing Cooperative are jointly training pest control personnel, preparing to train 8,000 people before spring plowing. Since January this year, the Hunan Provincial Cooperative Federation Preparatory Committee has not only transferred more than 75,000 dan of cotton cake to supply farmers in the Bin Hu area as feed for draft cattle, but also transferred more than 20,000 dan of ammonium sulfate and bone meal and other large quantities of fertilizers.

    调运生产资料供应农民春耕
    【本报讯】山东、广东、青海、山西、湖南、浙江、福建和江苏等省，积极调运大批生产资料供应农民春耕需要。
    目前，许多新式农具已陆续运往各地。山东省人民政府和供销合作社供给农民春耕使用两万部轻型双轮双铧犁和一千部中型双轮单铧犁。运到黄河下游两岸产棉区和沂南、海阳、荣成、昆仑等县的七千一百四十部，已开始发给预先订购的农业生产合作社，并向他们传授使用新式农具的技术。广东省供销合作社一月份调拨给省内各地农业生产合作社的生产资料已有五一式水田犁一万部（其中有三千多部为配件）、双轮双铧犁五百多部。今年广东省供销合作社生产资料的经营总额将要比去年增加百分之三十四左右。青海省供销合作社最近从北京、西安等地运来双轮双铧犁和各式改良步犁四百七十多部，供应各族农民准备春耕。
    各地为春耕播种准备了大量良种。山西省临汾县和榆次专区的十四个县为扩大棉田面积，已储备四百二十多万斤优良棉籽。阳曲县等四个农场准备下的金皇后玉米良种达十二万斤。山西省人民政府农业厅向东北地区订购的八十万斤纤维亚麻良种和向河北省尚义县订购的十二万斤胡麻种籽，不久就可运回。湖南省人民政府粮食厅和农业厅计划供应给滨湖地区农民的三千八百多万斤早、中、晚稻种籽，已有一千三百万斤早稻良种运到了滨湖地区。从江苏、浙江等省采购的五百多万斤优良棉种和大批黄麻种籽，也已开始往各地调运。浙江省以三千九百万斤稻种支援湖北、安徽两省曾遭受自然灾害地区农民和江西省农民进行春耕播种。其中支援湖北的一千八百万斤早、晚籼稻种，已陆续运出，支援安徽、江西的稻种，二月底以前可运到目的地。
    此外各地还调运许多农药和肥料供应农民春耕。福建省各经济部门支援农民春耕生产的活动已经开始。福建省合作总社正把数万吨化学肥料、饼肥、农药和大批喷雾器、双轮双铧犁陆续运往农村。每天在闽江上有三千多条木帆船和几十艘货轮从山区运出粮食，又为山区农民运进各种生产资料。福建省龙溪专区春耕开始得较早，各县供销合作社已把就地收购的肥料供应农民。江苏省供销合作社正把大批“六六六”药粉调往农村，供给旱田地区的农民防治地下害虫。江苏省人民政府农林厅和供销合作社正在联合训练治虫人员，准备春耕前训练八千人。湖南省合作社联合社筹备委员会今年一月份以来，除调运了七万五千多担棉饼供应滨湖区农民作耕牛饲料，还调运了二万多担硫酸铵和骨粉等大批肥料。
