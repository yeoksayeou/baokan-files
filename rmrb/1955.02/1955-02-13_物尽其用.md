    Making the Most of Everything
    Gong Sang
    Many investigation materials prove that a large number of stagnant and outdated machinery and equipment are stockpiled in the warehouses of many industrial departments and factories and mines. Most of these equipments were left over from the period of Japanese imperialism and the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and some were scrapped after liberation. This is an important potential that can be utilized. However, many departments have not made good use of these materials, but have allowed them to rust and deteriorate in damp and dark warehouses for a long time. The reason given by these enterprise owners is: "To build, we need new machines and new equipment. How can we achieve socialist industrialization with these old and broken machines?" This reasoning sounds very pleasant, but it is actually untenable.
    Because although our industrial construction should mainly be equipped with the latest technology, when we have not yet been able to re-equip the national economy with all new machines, we should make use of every old machine part. Facts tell us that if these old and broken equipments are well repaired and utilized, they will play a great role. We only need to give one example to illustrate this: In 1954 and 1953, among the many new power plants built across the country, nineteen sets of power generation equipment were built using old and broken machines that had originally been regarded as waste products. The electricity generated by these equipments can meet the production needs of forty-five textile mills with 50,000 spindles and 1,000 looms.
    Today's article "Jiangxi Local State-Owned Industry Attaches Importance to the Utilization of Stagnant Equipment" published in this edition, once again illustrates how important a role these old and broken equipments, which are neglected by some people, are playing in the construction of local state-owned industries!
    Thrift and economy, making the most of everything, is the traditional fine virtue of the Chinese people. "Think of the difficulty in getting every bowl of porridge and rice. Always remember the difficulty of material resources for every half thread." This is the supreme motto that our ancestors have always used to educate future generations. This spirit of thrift, which does not easily waste material wealth, is particularly worthy of being greatly promoted in our country, which is undergoing large-scale construction today. We believe that the spirit of thrift of the Jiangxi local state-owned industrial departments, which fully attaches importance to the utilization of stagnant materials, is worthy of learning by all state-owned industrial departments, especially the comrades of local state-owned industrial departments, and their experience can also be used as a reference for work in various places.

    物尽其用
    弓桑
    许多调查材料证明，不少工业部门和工厂、矿山企业的仓库里，堆存着大量呆滞的残旧的机器设备。这些设备大部分是在日本帝国主义和国民党反动派统治时期遗留下来的，也有一些是解放后报废的。这是一个可资利用的重要的潜力。但是有许多部门却没有把这些物资好好利用起来，而是让它们长期摆在霉湿、黑暗的仓库里生锈毁坏。这些企业主人的理由是：“要建设就得新机器新设备，靠这些破旧机器还能实现社会主义工业化？”这个道理，好像很动听，实际上却一点也站不住脚。
    因为我们的工业建设虽然主要的要以最新技术来装备，但当我们还没有可能用全部的新机器来重新装备国民经济的时候，我们就应当把每一件旧的机器另件都利用起来，事实告诉我们，这些残旧设备如果很好的加以修复利用，作用是很大的。我们只要举一个例子就可以说明了：一九五四年和一九五三年，全国建设的许多新发电厂中，有十九套发电设备，就是利用原来已被当作废品的残旧机器建设起来的，这些设备发出来的电力，可以供给四十五个五万纱锭和一千台布机的纺织厂生产的需要。
    今天本版发表的“江西地方国营工业重视利用呆滞设备”一稿，又一次说明了这些被某些人所忽视的残旧设备，在建设地方国营工业中，在起着多么重要的作用！
    勤俭节约，物尽其用，是中国人民传统的优良美德。“一粥一饭，当思来处不易。半丝半缕，恒念物力维艰。”这是我们的祖先一直用来教育后代的至理名言。这种不轻易糟蹋物资财富的节约精神，在我们国家正在大建设的今天，特别值得大大发扬光大。我们认为江西地方国营工业部门这种充分重视利用呆滞物资的节约精神，是值得一切国营工业部门，特别是地方国营工业部门的同志学习的，他们的这些经验，也可供各地工作时的参考。
