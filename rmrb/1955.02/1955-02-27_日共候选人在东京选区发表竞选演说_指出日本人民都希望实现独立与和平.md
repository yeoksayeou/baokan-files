Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 26th. Japanese Communist Party candidates for the Tokyo constituency in the House of Representatives, Matsumoto Mitsuyoshi and Miyamoto Kenji, delivered campaign speeches on the 24th.

    Matsumoto Mitsuyoshi said: The Japanese people all hope that Japan will achieve independence and peace. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to oppose the treaty signed in San Francisco and the US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement," and it is also necessary to oppose rearmament. Implement a fiscal policy that stabilizes people's lives and promotes prosperous peace industries. The state has a responsibility to help those who are suffering from hunger and are unable to work. Stop layoffs and military industrial rationalization, so that everyone has a job to do.

    Matsumoto Mitsuyoshi pointed out: As long as the people unite and work hard, such things will definitely be achieved. The Communist Party believes that even people with different ideas, as long as they hope to achieve peace and independence, the Japanese Communist Party is willing to unite and cooperate with them to fight for peace and independence together.

    Miyamoto Kenji focused on the issue of taxes in his speech. He said: Now the number of people paying income tax in Japan has increased to 15 million, and each person is forced to bear an average tax of 14,000 yen. Moreover, the Japanese government allocates 300 billion yen from the heavy taxes collected to rearmament, which is not allowed by the constitution. As a result, small and medium-sized enterprises are closing down one after another, with five or six hundred cases every month. Peaceful industries are declaring bankruptcy, and due to this influence, workers are being forced to accept low wages and layoffs are happening one after another.

    Miyamoto Kenji explained the Japanese Communist Party's proposition to abolish exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies.

    日共候选人在东京选区发表竞选演说
    指出日本人民都希望实现独立与和平
    【新华社二十六日讯】东京消息：日本共产党东京选区众议员候选人松本三益和宫本显治二十四日发表竞选演说。
    松本三益说：日本人民都希望日本实现独立与和平。为了实现这个目的，必须反对在旧金山签订的条约和美日“共同防御援助协定”，并且必须反对重整军备。实行安定人民生活和繁荣和平产业的财政政策。对于遭受饥饿和不能工作的人，国家有必要给予帮助。停止解雇和军事性的产业合理化，使所有的人都有工作可做。
    松本三益指出：只要人民团结起来，进行努力，这样的事情是一定会实现的。共产党认为，即使具有不同思想的人，只要他希望实现和平和独立，日本共产党就愿意同他团结合作，共同为争取和平和独立而斗争。
    宫本显治在他的演说中着重地谈了税款问题。他说：现在日本缴纳所得税的人数已经增加到一千五百万人，平均每人被迫负担一万四千日元的税款。而且，日本政府从征收这种重税敛来的税款中，拨出三千亿日元用到宪法所不容许的重整军备方面了。因此，中小企业倒闭的情况层出不穷，每月都有五、六百件。和平产业宣告破产，由于这种影响，迫使工人接受低廉工资和解雇工人的情况正在接连发生。
    宫本显治说明了日本共产党关于取消苛捐杂税的主张。
