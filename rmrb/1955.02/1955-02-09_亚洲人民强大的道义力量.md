    China's liberation of its territory Taiwan and opposition to US aggression and interference is a just struggle to safeguard national territorial sovereignty and defend Asian and world peace. Peace-loving people in Asia and around the world widely sympathize with and support the just struggle of the Chinese people. The incredibly powerful moral force supporting this just struggle can be seen in the fair opinions of various countries and the actual actions of the people.
    On February 6th, the Indian people, enthusiastically responding to the call of the All-India Peace Council, held large-scale mass movements in various parts of India for the "US Get Out of Taiwan Day." This movement strongly voiced the Indian people's love of peace and justice. Dr. Kitchlew, Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, said in a statement calling for the "US Get Out of Taiwan Day": "American troops must withdraw from Taiwan because Taiwan is an inseparable part of China." Under this resounding call of justice, peace organizations throughout India, the All-India Trade Union Congress, the All-India Farmers Association, and the All-India Students Federation and other people's organizations, as well as many members of parliament and public leaders in various provinces and states, actively participated in this movement. At the mass rally for "US Get Out of Taiwan Day" held at Gandhi Square in Delhi, the more than two thousand participants included many prominent figures from India, who unanimously passed a resolution condemning the United States' aggression of occupying Chinese territory and interfering in China's internal affairs, demanding that all American troops withdraw from Taiwan, and demanding that the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique be expelled from the United Nations, and that the government of the People's Republic of China—the only legitimate government representing six hundred million Chinese people—participate in the United Nations Security Council and other United Nations agencies.
    The Indian people's just position and proposition are similarly reflected in the Indian Parliament. More than twenty-five members of parliament and political leaders from various parties in the Indian Parliament recently held an emergency meeting and passed a resolution condemning the United States' military interference in China and appealing to responsible leaders of various countries to stop this dangerous war policy of the United States.
    This is strong support from the more than three hundred million people of India to the Chinese people. It strikingly demonstrates the increasingly consolidated and developing friendship between the peoples of China and India. Facts have proven that the joint efforts of the ten hundred million people of China and India, the two major Asian countries, to maintain peace are a huge force for consolidating peace in Asia and the world.
    The Asian people clearly recognize that the United States' occupation of Chinese territory and armed interference in China's internal affairs is the root cause of the tense situation in the Far East, and it increasingly seriously threatens the peace and security of Asia and the world. The US aggressor group cannot conceal the fact that they are intensifying their use of Taiwan as a base to attack the Chinese mainland and invade other Asian countries. As everyone knows, former US Far East Commander MacArthur had long openly stated that the US occupation of Taiwan was to make Taiwan the "hub" of the US Pacific front, so that the United States could "control every Asian port from Vladivostok to Singapore with air power." The signing of the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" even more nakedly exposed the US attempt to expand its preparations for a new war of aggression. US Secretary of State Dulles openly declared that this treaty was "another link" in the so-called security system established by the United States in the Pacific region. That is to say, the US aggressor group wants to link the US-Chiang treaty with the Manila Treaty and other war treaties in Asia and the Pacific region to form an Eastern aggression system. It wants to use such an aggressive system to interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries, maintain and expand its colonial rule over Asia, enslave the Asian people, and prepare for a new war. During the US Congress' debate on the US President's message requesting congressional authorization to use armed forces to openly interfere in China's internal affairs, some congressmen admitted that "the US policy will lead to war" and is for "conducting a war in Asia."
    In fact, the United States is currently conducting endless war provocations against China, preparing to expand its aggressive activities. The US Navy and Air Force are concentrating on a large scale in the Taiwan Strait and the Chinese seas. It is openly and directly participating in the military operations of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and attempting to invade our coastal islands. US military aircraft have even intruded into the airspace of our coastal islands, trying to provoke war. All these activities of the United States seriously threaten the peace and security of the people of Asian countries.
    This arrogant war policy of the United States is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people and unacceptable to all peace-loving people. Asian public opinion has expressed deep unease and opposition to this. Mr. Sundaral, Vice-Chairman of the All-India Peace Council, said: "The Taiwan issue is not just related to China, it is also our problem, and it critically affects the peace and security of India." Such an understanding is shared by the people of all Asian countries. It is based on this understanding that the Asian countries' support for the Chinese people and opposition to the US policy of aggression and war is rising daily. The Indian "Free Press" published an editorial on January 27 saying: "Under the circumstances of US armed interference in China's internal affairs, we can no longer sit idly by." The Indonesian "Sunday Courier" weekly called on February 6 that "all foreign forces must withdraw from Asia, and Asian people must be allowed to solve their own problems without foreign interference." The Burmese "Yangon Daily" also published an editorial on January 29, condemning the United States for expanding the Seventh Fleet to "protect" Taiwan on the one hand, and clamoring for a so-called "ceasefire" on the other. The editorial stated: "We cannot express sympathy for this political deception of the United States." The "Pakistan Times" further criticized the United States' so-called "security" excuse in a commentary on January 28, saying: "If all international law and international morality can be borrowed in the name of American security to justify America's forever control of islands belonging to China, then the concepts of national independence and sovereignty and the right to defend territorial integrity are completely meaningless."
    Today, anyone who is not blind can see that the Chinese people and the Asian people, who have repeatedly frustrated the US military adventure plan, will never be intimidated by the US's mad war threat. The Korean War ended in the failure of US armed interference, and the restoration of peace in Indochina once again stopped the US war attempt in Asia. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by the Sino-Indian and Sino-Burmese joint statements have promoted the expansion of the Asian peace zone. The Asian-African Conference initiated by the prime ministers of Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan is about to be held. The progress of all these peaceful efforts proves that the Asian people's firm will to oppose foreign aggression and war policies can play a significant role. The people of all countries must not allow the US war conspiracy to succeed and should continue to firmly take on the cause of opposing aggression and maintaining peace.
    Countless vivid experiences of struggle have fully proven that only by resisting aggression can we defend peace. Today, this truth is even more radiant.
    Since it is US aggression against and interference in China that is causing the tense situation and war threat in the Far East, in order to maintain peace and to ease the tense situation in the Taiwan region and the Far East, the United States must stop its aggression against China and interference in China's internal affairs, and all US armed forces must withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. Any attempt to divide China's territory and condone and encourage aggression, such as "neutralization," "UN trusteeship," "two Chinas," etc., is harmful to the cause of peace, and is also unacceptable to the Chinese people and peace-loving people of all countries.
    The Chinese people's firm and unwavering position is to carry the just struggle to liberate Taiwan to the end. The support of the people of Asian and other countries around the world for this just position of the Chinese people is also support for world peace and the interests of the people of all countries. The Chinese people cherish this support very much. We believe that the cause of maintaining peace and independent sovereignty is just, and the just cause is bound to win.

    亚洲人民强大的道义力量
    中国人民解放自己的领土台湾，反对美国的侵略和干涉，是维护国家领土主权，保卫亚洲和世界和平的正义斗争。亚洲和世界爱好和平的人民广泛地同情和支持中国人民这个正义斗争。从各国公正舆论和人民的实际行动中，都可以看到支持这个正义斗争的无比强大的道义力量。
    二月六日，印度人民，热烈响应全印和平理事会的号召，在印度各地举行了美国“撤出台湾日”的大规模群众性运动。这个运动强烈地发出了印度人民热爱和平和正义的呼声。全印和平理事会主席克其鲁博士在号召举行美国“撤出台湾日”的声明中说：“美国军队必须撤出台湾，因为台湾是中国不可分割的一部分”。在这一响亮的正义的号召下，印度各地的和平组织，全印总工会、全印农民协会和全印学生联合会等人民团体，以及各省邦的许多议员和公众领袖，都积极地参加了这个运动。在德里甘地广场举行的美国“撤出台湾日”群众大会上，参加的两千多人中包括了印度的许多著名人士，他们一致通过决议，谴责美国霸占中国领土和干涉中国内政的侵略行为，要求一切美国部队撤出台湾，并要求把蒋介石卖国集团的代表驱逐出联合国，让中华人民共和国政府——代表六亿中国人民的唯一合法的政府——参加联合国安全理事会和联合国其他机构。
    印度人民的这个正义立场和主张，同样地反映在印度国会中。印度国会中属于各党派的二十五位以上的议员和政治领袖们最近举行了紧急会议，通过了决议，谴责美国对中国的军事干涉，吁请各国负责领袖们制止美国这种危险的战争政策。
    这是印度三亿多人民给予中国人民的有力的支持。它显著地表现了中印两国人民之间日益巩固和发展的友谊。事实证明，中印两大亚洲国家的十亿人民为维护和平而作的共同努力，是巩固亚洲及世界和平一支巨大的力量。
    亚洲人民清楚地认识，美国侵占中国领土，武装干涉中国内政的行为，是造成远东紧张局势的根源，它日益严重地威胁亚洲和世界的和平和安全。美国侵略集团自己也不能掩饰，他们是在一步加紧一步地利用台湾作为进攻中国大陆和侵略其他亚洲国家的基地。大家知道，美国前远东军总司令麦克阿瑟早就明目张胆地表示过，美国侵占台湾是要把台湾作为美国太平洋前线中的“总枢纽”，以便美国“用空军控制自海参威到新加坡的每一亚洲的海港”。美蒋“共同防御条约”的签订，更露骨地暴露了美国企图扩大侵略准备新战争的计划。美国国务卿杜勒斯公开声言，这个条约是美国在太平洋区建立的所谓安全体系中的“另一个环节”。这就是说，美国侵略集团要把美蒋条约同马尼剌条约和在亚洲和太平洋区的其他战争条约联结一起，形成一个东方侵略体系。它想利用这样一个侵略体系来干涉亚洲各国内政，保持和扩大对亚洲的殖民统治，奴役亚洲人民，准备新战争。美国国会在辩论美国总统要求国会授权使用武装部队公开干涉中国内政的咨文时，有些议员就承认“美国的方针会导致战争”，是为了“进行亚洲战争”。
    事实上，美国目前正在对中国进行无休止的战争挑衅，准备扩大它的侵略活动。美国海空军正在台湾海峡和中国海面大规模集中，它公然直接参与蒋介石卖国集团的军事行动，并企图侵占我国沿海岛屿。美国军用飞机更侵入我国沿海岛屿领空，力图挑起战争。所有美国的这些活动都严重地威胁到亚洲各国人民的和平和安全。
    美国这种狂妄的战争政策，是中国人民所绝对不能容许的，也是一切爱好和平的人民所不能容许的。亚洲舆论对此表示深切的不安和反对。全印和平理事会副主席森德拉尔说：“台湾问题不单单是同中国有关，它也是我们的问题，它至关紧要地影响着印度的和平和安全。”这样的认识，是亚洲各国人民所共有的。正是基于这样的认识，亚洲各国人民支持中国人民，反对美国侵略政策和战争政策的斗争，日益高涨起来。印度“自由报”一月二十七日发表社论说：“在美国武装干涉中国内政的情况下，我们不能再静坐无动于衷了。”印度尼西亚“星期日信使”周刊二月六日呼吁“一切外国势力必须撤出亚洲，必须让亚洲人民在没有外国干涉的情况下解决自己的问题”，缅甸“仰光日报”一月二十九日也发表社论，谴责美国一面扩大第七舰队“保护”台湾，一面又叫嚷所谓“停火”，社论表示：“我们对于美国这种政治欺骗行动是不能表示同情的。”“巴基斯坦时报”在一月二十八日的评论中更指斥美国的所谓“安全”的借口说：“如果一切国际法和国际道义能被美国的安全这个名义所假借，来证明美国永远控制属于中国的岛屿的行为是正当的，那么一切国家独立和主权的观念和保卫领土完整的权利，就完全没有意义了。”
    今天，只要不是瞎子，都能看见，曾经一再挫败了美国军事冒险计划的中国人民和亚洲人民，决不是美国疯狂的战争威胁所能吓倒的。朝鲜战争是以美国武装干涉的失败而结束的，印度支那和平的恢复又一次制止了美国在亚洲的战争企图。中印、中缅联合声明倡导的和平共处的五项原则，推动了扩大亚洲和平地区的努力。缅甸、锡兰、印度、印度尼西亚、巴基斯坦五国总理发起的亚非会议，即将举行。这一切和平努力的进展，证明了亚洲人民反对外来侵略政策和战争政策的坚强意志是能够发挥重大作用的。各国人民决不能容许美国的战争阴谋得逞，应当继续坚决把反对侵略、维护和平的事业担当起来。
    无数生动的斗争经验充分证明了，只有反抗侵略，才能保卫和平。今天，这个真理更加显现了它的光辉。
    既然造成远东紧张局势和战争威胁的是美国对中国的侵略和干涉，因此，为了维护和平，为了缓和台湾地区和远东的紧张局势，就必须使美国停止侵略中国和干涉中国内政，必须使美国一切武装力量从台湾和台湾海峡撤退。任何企图割裂中国的领土，纵容和鼓励侵略的办法，如“中立化”、“联合国托管”、“两个中国”等等，都是对和平事业有害的，同时也是中国人民和各国爱好和平人民所不容许的。
    中国人民坚定不移的立场，是要把解放台湾的正义斗争进行到底。亚洲和世界各国人民对中国人民这个正义立场的支持，也正是对世界和平和各国人民利益的支持。中国人民非常珍视这种支持。我们相信，维护和平和独立主权的事业是正义的，正义的事业是一定要胜利的。
