    Mulberry Fields Should Not Be Destroyed
    Jin Yu
    Some basic-level cadres in Hai’ning County, Zhejiang Province, are mobilizing farmers to destroy mulberry trees and seedlings, converting mulberry fields into paddy fields. Fearing that farmers would not do so, they even used groundless accusations such as "growing mulberry is developing capitalism" to intimidate them.

    In order to increase grain production, the Xinhong Agricultural Production Cooperative of Qianjin Township, Wuxing County, Zhejiang Province, dug up all the mulberry trees on the ridges that could feed five silkworm egg sheets. In Tongxiang County, farmers dug up more than 1,100 mu of mulberry fields in response to the call from higher authorities to increase grain production. Similar situations have occurred in other provinces as well.

    Those who advocate digging up mulberry fields have good intentions: the country's industrialization needs grain, so it is necessary to expand grain fields and increase grain production.

    National industrialization does require grain, but it also needs other important materials, such as oil, cotton, machinery, steel, and so on. Many of these materials need to be imported, which means they need to be exchanged for our export commodities. Silk is one of China's main export commodities at present. One ton of raw silk can be exchanged for ninety-four tons of steel, which shows how great its economic value is. Of course, everyone knows that without mulberry trees, silk cannot be produced.

    The state requires an increase in silk production. Developing new mulberry areas and planting mulberry trees on a large scale are the basic ways to increase silk production. But it cannot solve the current problem. Mulberry trees are perennial plants, and it generally takes about ten years from seedling cultivation to mass leaf harvesting. If seedlings are cultivated and mulberry trees are planted this year, leaves can only be produced in large quantities around 1964. However, the state requires silk production to return to the highest pre-war level in 1962.

    If the production potential of existing mulberry fields is fully utilized, there is a danger that mulberry leaves will be in short supply. How can the phenomenon of felling mulberry trees be tolerated? It cannot. We should oppose "draining the pond to catch all the fish" and must immediately stop the destruction of mulberry fields.

    不应毁坏桑田
    近宇
    浙江省海宁县的一些基层干部动员农民毁掉桑树、桑苗，把桑田改成稻田。他们唯恐农民不这样做，竟用“种桑是发展资本主义”等等无中生有的话来恐吓农民。
    浙江省吴兴县千金乡新虹农业生产合作社为了增产粮食，把田坎上可以饲育五张蚕种的桑树全部掘掉。桐乡县农民在上级增产粮食的号召下，挖毁桑田一千一百多亩。其他各省也有类似的情形。
    提倡掘挖桑田的人都有一番好心：国家工业化需要粮食，因此要扩大粮田，增产粮食。
    国家工业化确实需要粮食，但同时还需要其他重要物资，如油料、棉花、机器、钢材等等。这些物资有许多是要进口的，就是说，要用我们的出口物资去换的。丝绸是我国目前主要出口商品的一种。一吨生丝可以换回九十四吨钢材，可见它的经济价值有多么大。当然，谁都知道，没有桑树，是不能生产丝绸的。
    国家要求增加蚕丝生产。开拓新的桑区，大量栽桑育蚕，是增加蚕丝生产的基本办法。但它解决不了当前的问题。桑树是多年生的植物，由育苗到大量采叶，一般要经过十年左右。如果在今年育苗栽桑，一九六四年前后才能大量产叶。但国家要求蚕丝生产在一九六二年恢复到战前最高水平。
    充分发挥现有桑田的生产潜力，桑叶都有供不应求的危险，难道能够容忍砍伐桑树的现象么？不能。我们应该反对“竭泽而渔”，必须立即制止毁坏桑田的现象。
