Xinhua News Agency, Rome, February 19th: The signature campaign against atomic war by the people of Italy is rapidly unfolding. According to Italian progressive newspapers, on the 14th alone, 45,000 people signed in the provinces of Ragusa and Catania. Among the 600 employees of a textile factory in Milan Province, 550 signed. In Sesto San Giovanni, Milan Province, 5,000 signatures were collected in just a few hours.

During the signature campaign, the ranks of peace supporters in Italy have greatly expanded. In Novara, the owner of the Ghidi textile factory decided to sign the "Appeal to the People of the World" together with the workers. A priest in Milan, Austin Danti, participated in a meeting of the Milan Peace Committee and said: "I feel that my responsibility now is to be with you. I see here people who, like me, do not want war and are prepared to fight against war." The peace committees of six cities in Rome Province, including Civitavecchia and San Gimignano in Siena Province, passed resolutions demanding the destruction of all stored atomic weapons and the prohibition of the manufacture of atomic weapons; the members of two of these peace committees are mostly Christian Democrats.
