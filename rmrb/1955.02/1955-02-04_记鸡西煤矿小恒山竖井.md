　　Record of the Xiaohéngshān Vertical Shaft at the Jixi Coal Mine

　　Advanced Design

　　The Qǐfú mountain range, stretching hundreds of *lǐ*, is covered in a vast expanse of white snow. As the car crests the hillside, the majestic headframe, as tall as a ten-story building, immediately appears before us in the distance, surrounded by a cluster of red buildings of varying heights. This is the Xiaohéngshān Vertical Shaft of the Jixi Coal Mine.

　　Construction on the Xiaohéngshān Vertical Shaft began in July 1950. After more than four years of arduous construction, it is now about to be handed over for production.

　　The Xiaohéngshān Vertical Shaft was designed by Chinese engineering and technical personnel, learning from advanced Soviet experience and with the specific assistance of Soviet experts.

　　The mine is very advanced in design, with all heavy labor replaced by mechanical operations.

　　In coal mines, the most cumbersome and health-damaging work is transportation. Before liberation, all transportation work was done by manpower; people carried coal on their backs, people hauled coal, people pushed coal, people pulled coal. The miners lived a miserable life, worse than livestock. Yú Shìyāng, an old miner who participated in the construction of the shaft, told us: Before liberation, when he was pulling coal with a drag in a thin coal seam, the dark coal tunnel was less than half a person's height. People could only crawl like four-legged animals, with the rope of the drag on their shoulders, constantly emitting gasps and groans, climbing up and down the damp slopes full of puddles. Returning to the *kàng* at night, they couldn't even lift their legs. This inhuman heavy labor had buried the health of countless young people.

　　The modernized vertical shaft has completely changed this heavy labor. In the Xiaohéngshān Vertical Shaft, we can no longer find the low, dark, and damp signs of the old mines. What we see is a bright, orderly, and spacious underground city. From the spiderweb-like underground yard, a series of tram tracks extend to each tunnel and mining area. These permanent transport tunnels are all arch-shaped roads built with cement. The snow-white walls will be fitted with sconces, illuminating the tunnels brightly. After the miners go down the shaft, they no longer have to walk long distances in the tunnels with their heads lowered. Instead, a Donbass-style battery-powered electric locomotive takes them to the working face, where they begin a pleasant day's work. At the working face, the coal mining "combine," busily gnawing at the coal seam, emits a huge sound, automatically cutting off the coal seam, crushing it, and sending it into the chain conveyor. Here, we don't see workers pushing coal carts back and forth, only the chain conveyor constantly pouring the black stream into the coal cars. After a long line of coal cars is fully loaded, the electric locomotive roars and runs forward with them. Approaching the bottom yard, we don't see many workers helping to load and unload coal. With just a gentle touch from the "tippler," whole cars of coal are dumped into the bottom coal bunker. At this time, the signal automatically notifies the monster at the top of the headframe—the skip. This hoisting equipment, two stories high and capable of carrying six tons of coal at a time, immediately comes down to the bottom yard with a whoosh, opens its giant mouth, eats its fill of coal, and then rises lightly to the top of the headframe, hundreds of meters above. On the surface, we see even fewer workers pushing carts to load and unload. The belt carries the coal blocks automatically into the coal preparation plant, and then automatically divides the coal blocks into various grades. Finally, the selected coal blocks pass through a very long "belt corridor" all the way to the last coal bunker—the elevated railway coal bunker—and slide down the hopper into the train, from where it begins its true long journey.

　　Here, labor has become easy and enjoyable. Such complex transport and coal preparation equipment on the surface is operated by just one worker pressing buttons in a small room. Of course, this requires excellent skills.

　　The old miners here also told us: In the old mines before liberation, miners not only had to endure heavy physical labor, but also had to risk their lives every day, working on hot, poorly supported working faces. The miners' safety was constantly threatened. In conditions where even air was hard to come by, there was no question of any safety facilities. The miners could only place their hopes on "divine blessings." A "Laojun Temple" was built at the entrance of the mine, and the miners would come here to burn incense and kowtow before going down the mine every day. But the "gods" could not give the miners any protection, and the threat of death could not be escaped. Therefore, people regarded the mines as "hell on earth."

　　Now, the modernized vertical shaft has turned "hell on earth" into a pleasant workplace. In the Xiaohéngshān Vertical Shaft, there is a perfect ventilation system, and each miner can get three cubic meters of fresh air per minute. There are rock dust barriers to prevent methane explosions, and fire doors, waterproof airtight doors, fireproof trains, and underground medical stations to ensure safe production. At the working face, spraying equipment constantly washes away the coal dust flying in the working face. Various mechanical and electrical equipment in the mine have devices to prevent methane explosions. All of this allows the miners to carry out pleasant labor in a very safe environment.

　　In the "industrial square" near the headframe, there is an exquisite red building under construction—the administrative and welfare complex building. After this building is completed, the miners will come here by bus every day, change into work clothes, pass through a heated "dark passage" (the lights here are dim to avoid stimulating the eyes when the workers suddenly go to a dark place when they go down the mine), and then take a cage down the mine. After work, they return to the building to shower, sunbathe with artificial light, and have the dirty clothes washed and ironed by machines. Then, after eating in the dining hall and getting a haircut, they can follow their interests, either watching movies, dancing, playing chess, playing ball, or reading books in the library. Around the square, tens of thousands of trees and brocade-like flowerbeds will be planted to turn the mine into a beautiful garden.

　　Arduous Construction

　　When building this "underground factory," the construction workers experienced many thrilling and unimaginable hardships. The construction worker, Comrade Zhāng Fù, told us: When the vertical shaft was broken ground in 1950, and the shaft was excavated to below fifty meters, a water-bearing layer was encountered. The water势became larger and larger, and at its maximum, the outflow suddenly increased to 120 tons per hour. Such a large amount of groundwater was several times greater than a summer rainstorm. It sprayed out from countless large and small "spring eyes" around the shaft wall day and night, causing serious difficulties for the shaft sinking work. Although the construction workers wore three sets of raincoats plus waterproof vests and underpants, when they raised their hands to operate, water immediately drilled into every part of their body from the tight cuffs and collars. The flood beat on their hands, causing them to swell and turn red. At this time, it was the severe winter season of minus thirty degrees Celsius, and in addition, the material conditions were difficult in the early stage of construction, and there was not even a warm drying room on the surface. Under such circumstances, the workers still persisted in their unremitting struggle.

　　…One afternoon, suddenly a water pump used for pumping water broke down, and the accumulated water rose immediately. Zhāng Fù and Zhuāng Zhènhé allowed the remaining workers to board the cage. In order to complete the final task, they stayed behind. The icy flood, like countless whips, struck them so that they could not lift their heads. They were so frozen that their teeth could not close together, but they still waded through the knee-deep water, holding their picks and rushing towards the rock… The water gradually rose to their chests, breathing began to become difficult, and their bodies began to float. Zhāng Fù gritted his teeth, found two large stones underwater, and raised his body a little higher, still "dé, dé, dé…" working. An hour later, they completed the final task, dragging their numb bodies and climbing onto the cage with difficulty. The flood had washed the one-ton iron cage so that it was floating on the water surface.

　　…Later, they encountered even greater difficulties. When the project progressed to bricklaying on the shaft wall, the mortar was washed away by the water before you could put the cement bricks on. If the quality of the shaft wall could not be guaranteed, then all the efforts would be in vain. Zhāng Fù and other comrades thought of a way to build wooden sheds on top, and then cover them with iron sheets and canvas, leaving empty channels in the middle for the cages to go up and down. This way, the water would no longer flow onto the cement bricks, but would flow along the iron sheets onto the heads and backs of the people who were laying the bricks. Because the flood was more concentrated, it was like whole buckets of water hitting people's bodies, and people with less strength could simply be knocked over. Under these serious circumstances, Zhāng Fù and the others would rather endure the swelling and pain, protecting the cement bricks with their bodies day and night, laying the cement bricks one by one from hundreds of meters underground to the mouth of the well, ensuring the quality of the shaft. The construction workers fought in the flood for twenty-six months, back and forth.

　　Learning from Painful Lessons

　　The leaders of the Xiaohéngshān Vertical Shaft construction also told us with heavy hearts: Although the design of the Xiaohéngshān Vertical Shaft is advanced, and countless moving events have occurred in the arduous struggle of shaft construction, when construction of this mine began, the Northeast Coal Mine Industry Department and the former Jixi Coal Mine leaders lacked experience and had the idea of being greedy and rash, and made serious mistakes. Now, according to various conditions, especially because the coal seam is closer to the surface, building two pairs of inclined shafts is more reasonable than a vertical shaft. Not only can it undertake the task of coal production in the same way, but it can also extract coal fifty meters down along the outcrop. Building inclined shafts can save national investment and produce coal quickly (building an inclined shaft takes less than half the time of building a vertical shaft). Even more seriously, the construction of the Xiaohéngshān Vertical Shaft was carried out without geological data and design, and has always been carried out at great risk. There was a time when it was mistakenly thought that the recoverable reserves could not meet the design needs, so they did not hesitate to sacrifice the inclined shafts to ensure the vertical shaft, and rashly closed four inclined shafts nearby that had a lifespan of more than fifteen years. But in fact, the reserves far exceeded the design needs. At the same time, due to unclear geological conditions, the vertical shaft was mistakenly built on the hillside on the edge of the coalfield, forcing the railway line to detour upwards, increasing the investment by tens of billions of *yuán*. At the same time, because the shaft is not built in the center of the coalfield, the mine's production will be in an unreasonable state for a long time to come. Now, as we are welcoming the completion of the Xiaohéngshān Vertical Shaft, we should also remember the serious lessons of the Xiaohéngshān Vertical Shaft's mistakes due to greed, rashness, and lack of experience.

    记鸡西煤矿小恒山竖井
    金雨困　李方沉
    先进的设计
    起伏数百里的定达山脉被白茫茫的大雪覆盖着。当汽车翻过山坡时，远处十多层楼房高的雄伟的井架马上显现在我们眼前，在井架旁边围绕着一片高高低低的红色建筑物。这就是鸡西煤矿小恒山竖井。
       小恒山竖井于一九五○年七月破土兴工，经过四年多的艰苦建设，现在快要移交生产了。
       小恒山竖井是学习苏联先进经验，并在苏联专家具体帮助下，由我国工程技术人员设计的。
    这个矿井设计得很先进，沉重的劳动全部为机械操作所代替了。
    在煤矿中最笨重和损害人们健康的是运输工作。解放前，所有的运输工作全由人力担负；人背煤、人挑煤、人推煤、人拉煤，矿工们过着连牲畜还不如的悲惨生活。参加建井的老矿工于士泱告诉我们：解放前他在薄煤层用爬犁拉煤时，黑黝黝的煤洞还不到半人高，人只能像四条腿的牲口一样爬着，肩上拉着爬犁的绳子，不断地发出喘息呻吟的声音，在到处是水洼的阴湿的斜坡上爬上爬下，晚上回来上炕都抬不动腿，这种非人的沉重劳动，曾葬送了无数年青人的健康。
    现代化的竖井彻底改变了这种沉重的劳动。在小恒山竖井，我们再也找不到旧矿井里那种低矮、阴暗、潮湿的迹象了。我们看见的是一座明亮、整齐、宽坦的地下城市。从蛛网般的井底车场延伸出
  一条条的电车轨道，通往每个巷道和采煤区。这些永久性的运输巷道，都是用水泥修成的拱形马路。粉刷得雪白的墙上将装设着壁灯，把巷道照得明亮辉煌。矿工们下井后，再不用低着头走长距离的巷道，而是由顿巴斯式的蓄电池电机车把他送到工作面上，开始一天的愉快劳动。在工作面上紧张地啃食着煤层的采煤“康拜因”发出巨大的声音，自动地把煤层截下，打碎，送入链板运输机。在这里看不到来来往往的推煤车的工人，只看见链板运输机不断地把黑色的溪流倾注到煤车里，一长列的煤车全部装满以后，电机车便一声怒吼带着它们往前奔跑。快到井底车场时，并不见许多工人来帮着装卸煤炭，只要与“翻笼”轻轻一碰，整车整车的煤便翻入了井底煤仓。这时，信号就自动通知地面井架上端的怪物——箕斗。这个有两层楼高一次能装六吨煤的提升设备，马上就哗的一下来到井底，打开它的巨嘴，吃饱了煤炭，然后又是那么轻轻巧巧的一下子升到数百公尺的井架上端去了。在地面上更加看不见来来往往推车装卸的工人。皮带载着煤块自动地进入选煤场，又自动地把煤块分成各种等级。最后，选好的煤块经过很长很长的“皮带走廊”，一直跑到最后的一个煤仓——架空的铁路煤仓，顺着漏斗滑进火车，从这里开始了它的真正的长途旅程。
    在这里，劳动已经变得轻松愉快。像地面上这样复杂的运输选煤设备，仅由一个工人在一间小房间里按动电钮来操纵。当然，这必需要有很好的技术才行。
    这里的老矿工还告诉我们：在解放前的旧矿井里，矿工们不仅要忍受沉重的体力劳动，还要每天冒着生命的危险，在闷热的、支柱不良的工作面上工作。矿工们的安全时刻遭受着威胁。在连空气都难以满足的情况下，是根本谈不到什么安全设施的。矿工们只能将希望寄托于“神佛保佑”，井口建了一个“老君庙”，每天下井前矿工们都要来这里烧香叩头。但是“神”并不能给矿工以任何保佑，死亡的威胁始终无法解脱，因此人们都把矿山当做“人间地狱”。
    现在，现代化的竖井把“人间地狱”变成了愉快的劳动场所。在小恒山竖井，有完善的通风系统，每个矿工每分钟可以得到三立方公尺的新鲜空气。有防止瓦斯爆炸的岩粉棚子和保证安全生产的防火门、防水密闭门、防火列车和井下医疗站。在工作面上，喷雾设备不时地清洗着工作面上飞扬的煤尘。井下的各种机电设备上都有防止引起瓦斯爆炸的装置。所有这些都使矿工们能在十分安全的情况下进行愉快的劳动。
    在井架附近的“工业广场”上，有一座正在建筑中的精致的红色建筑物——行政福利联合大楼。这座大楼建成后，矿工们每天坐着公共汽车到这里来，换上工作服，穿过装有暖气的“暗道”（这里的灯光很暗，以免工人下井时突然到黑处，使眼睛受到刺激），然后坐罐笼下井。下工后，回到大楼淋浴，照日光灯，机器把脏衣服洗净熨好。然后在饭厅里吃过饭，理过发，就可以按照自己的兴趣，或者看电影、跳舞，或者下棋、打球，或者到图书馆看书。在广场的四围，将种上数万棵树木和织锦似的花圃，使矿山变成一座美丽的花园。
    艰苦的建设
    在建设这座“地下工厂”时，建井工人们曾经过许多惊险和难以想像的艰苦。建井工人张富同志告诉我们：当一九五○年竖井破土兴工后，井筒开凿到五十公尺以下时，遇到了含水层。水势越来越大，最大时突然增加到每小时流出水量达一百二十吨。这样大的地下水，比夏天的暴雨还要大几倍，它从井壁四周无数大小“泉眼”里终日不止的喷射出来，给打井工作带来了严重的困难。建井工人虽然穿了三套雨衣外加防水的背心和衬裤，但当举起手来操作时，水立即从扎紧的袖口和领口钻到身体的每一处。洪水冲打在手上，把手打得红肿起来。而这时正逢零下三十度的严寒季节，加上建井初期物质条件困难，井上连个暖和的干燥室也没有，就在这样的情况下，工人们仍旧坚持不懈地斗争着。
        ……有一天下午，忽然一台用来抽水的水泵出了毛病，积水马上上涨了。张富和庄振和两个人就让其余的工人登上罐笼，为了争取完成最后的任务，自己留了下来。冰寒刺骨的洪水像无数条鞭子一样，抽打得他们抬不起头来，人冻得牙齿都合不上缝，但他们仍然趟着没膝的水拿着镐头向岩石扑去。……水渐渐涨到胸口，呼吸开始困难了，身子也发飘了。张富咬紧牙关，在水下摸出两块大石块，把身子垫高些，仍然“得、得、得……”地干着。一个小时后，他俩完成最后的任务，拖着麻木的身子、困难地爬上罐笼时，大水已把一吨重的铁罐笼冲得飘在水面上。
    ……后来，他们又碰到了更大的困难。当工程进行到在井壁砌砖时，没有等你把水泥砖放上，大水就把灰浆冲跑了。如果井壁的质量不能保证，那么全部努力都要落空。张富和其他同志就想办法在上边搭上木棚子，又盖上铁皮和帆布，中间留下上下罐笼的空道。这样水就不再流到水泥砖上，而是顺着铁皮流到正在砌砖的人的头上和背上了。由于洪水更加集中，简直像整桶整桶的水往人的身上冲击，力气小一点的人简直可以打得翻筋斗。在这种严重的情况下，张富他们宁可忍受肿痛，日日夜夜以自己的身子护着水泥砖，就这样一块一块的把水泥砖从数百公尺的井下砌到井口，保证了井筒的质量。建井工人就这样在洪水下前前后后搏斗了二十六个月。
    吸取沉痛的教训
    建设小恒山竖井的领导人员，还以沉痛的心情告诉我们：虽然小恒山竖井的设计是先进的，在建井的艰苦斗争中曾出现过无数动人的事例，但是在开始建设这个矿井时，由于东北煤矿工业部门和前鸡西煤矿的领导上缺乏经验和有贪多冒进的思想，曾犯了严重的错误。现在根据各方面条件来看，特别是由于煤层离地表较近，建设两对斜井要比竖井更为合理，不仅同样可以担负出煤的任务，而且顺着露头下去五十公尺即可采到煤炭。建设斜井既可节省国家投资，又能很快出煤（建设一个斜井还不到建设一个竖井的一半时间）。更严重的是小恒山竖井的施工是在没有地质资料和设计情况下进行的，一直冒着很大的风险。曾有一个时期错误地以为可采的埋藏量远不能满足设计需要，就不惜牺牲斜井来保证竖井，冒然将附近四个寿命都在十五年以上的斜井封闭了。但实际上埋藏量远远超过了设计的需要。同时由于地质情况不清，错误地把竖井井筒建在煤田边沿的半山腰上，使铁道线不得不绕道而上，增加了投资数十亿元。同时由于井筒不建在煤田中心，使得今后矿井生产长期陷于不合理的状态中。现在当我们正在迎接小恒山竖井建成的时候，也应该记取小恒山竖井因贪多冒进和经验不足而犯错误的严重教训。
