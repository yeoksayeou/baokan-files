Xinhua News Agency, London, February 3rd: The communique issued by the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference indicates that the meeting continued its general discussion of the international situation, particularly developments in Europe and the Middle East, at the plenary session on the morning of February 1st.

The meeting also discussed military issues concerning "defense responsibilities under the North Atlantic Treaty and defense responsibilities in Europe, Africa, and the South Pacific." The meeting was chaired by Churchill. The Prime Ministers of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa, as well as the British Chiefs of Staff and some military advisors from Commonwealth countries' governments, attended the meeting. The Prime Ministers of India, Pakistan, and Ceylon did not participate in the meeting discussing military issues.

Reuters reported that Prime Minister Churchill insisted that Commonwealth countries should more actively participate in the military preparations being undertaken by Britain. He delivered a speech at the meeting, requesting the participating countries to play a greater role in the defense of the Commonwealth. He particularly emphasized the enormous military obligations that Britain bears overseas. Churchill also requested the Prime Ministers of each country to bear a larger share of the burden in common defense.

As can be seen from a report by Max, a commentator for the "Daily Express," the purpose of the discussions at the meeting was: Britain hopes to transfer most of the military expenditure burden to the Commonwealth countries.
