Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Should Adjust Retail Prices

Following the decision of the First National Congress of Cooperatives in July of last year, supply and marketing cooperatives across the country are gradually adjusting retail prices. Recently, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives issued another directive, requiring local cooperatives to adjust retail prices to the level of state-owned commercial list prices before February 15th. From then on, the retail prices of supply and marketing cooperatives will be consistent with state-owned commercial list prices, and the price preferences given to members by supply and marketing cooperatives will cease.

For several years, cooperatives in most regions have been determining retail prices based on the principle of being lower than list prices, giving price preferences to members. This practice was once completely necessary and completely correct. During our country's economic recovery period, the old commercial network in rural areas had been destroyed, and a new commercial network had not yet formed. National commerce was in a relatively stagnant state. At that time, socialist commerce was still very weak, and had not gained an advantage in either the wholesale or retail markets. Private commercial capital could still manipulate market prices, engage in speculation and profiteering, and exploit urban and rural producers and consumers. Under these circumstances, the urgent demand of the vast number of farmers and urban residents was to invigorate the urban and rural economy and reduce intermediate exploitation. In addition to actively carrying out supply and marketing operations to meet the supply and marketing needs of its members, the supply and marketing cooperative adopted the principle of "supplying at prices lower than market prices and purchasing at reasonable prices" to give preferential treatment to members, which limited and reduced the intermediate exploitation of private merchants, assisted state-owned commerce in stabilizing prices, and protected the interests of urban and rural working people. The prestige of the cooperatives among the masses was enhanced, and the working people joined the cooperatives in large numbers. The national supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives rapidly developed into commercial organizations including hundreds of millions of working people. Since 1953, after the state successively implemented the unified purchase and sale of grain, cotton cloth, and oil and the unified purchase of cotton, the state has controlled the main sources of goods, and the proportion of public and private commerce and the entire market relationship have undergone fundamental changes. In wholesale commerce, private capital has been basically excluded. In the retail market, state-owned commerce and cooperative commerce have gained an advantage, and the supply and marketing cooperatives have basically controlled the rural market. Private retailers can no longer manipulate the market and play with prices as they did in the past. This means that the necessity for supply and marketing cooperatives to give price preferences to their members has disappeared, and the possibility of raising retail prices to the level of state-owned commercial list prices is now available.

Adjusting retail prices by cooperatives is beneficial to the state's accumulation of industrialization funds. In the past few years, in order to support the development of supply and marketing cooperatives, the state has given preferential treatment in taxation, wholesale prices, loans, and transportation. The commodities wholesaled by state-owned commerce to supply and marketing cooperatives were given a preference of 2% to 6% over general wholesale prices, averaging about 3.9%. This item alone amounted to more than 1,630 billion yuan in 1954. The state's gradual cancellation of these preferences for cooperatives will save a batch of funds that can be invested in industrial construction. Distributing this batch of funds to each member results in a very small amount, but when concentrated, it can play a very large role. Accumulating the necessary funds to realize the country's industrialization is the supreme interest of the people of the whole country, and of course also of all cooperative members. There is no doubt that this measure will be supported by all cooperative members.

Adjusting retail prices by cooperatives can also promote the improvement of business management and the improvement of the quality of service to members. In the past, the cooperatives' acceptance of various preferential treatments granted by the state played a great role in the development of supply and marketing businesses; but on the other hand, the idea of supply system among some cooperative cadres has also grown as a result. They do not pay attention to economic accounting and rational accumulation, so that some cooperatives have suffered losses. Now that the state is gradually stopping the preferential treatment of cooperatives, cooperatives can no longer use the state's preferential treatment to make up for losses in operation. They must strengthen business management and improve service attitude, continuously expand supply and marketing businesses and gradually increase accumulation, which is conducive to the consolidation and improvement of supply and marketing cooperatives.

Some people say: If the price of the cooperative is not cheaper than the price of state-owned commerce, what is the benefit of joining the cooperative? If members pay the same price for goods as non-members, isn't there no difference between members and non-members? Therefore, they are concerned that the masses who have not joined the cooperative will not join again, and some members may request to withdraw from the cooperative. This understanding is not comprehensive enough.

As everyone knows, the main purpose of organizing supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives, that is, the main task of supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives, is to serve agricultural production and the consumption of the working people through supply and marketing businesses and consumer businesses. The working people organize cooperatives not for profit, nor merely to be able to buy cheaper things; their fundamental demand is to run the cooperatives well in order to meet their own needs in production and life. Past facts have proved that the benefits that cooperatives bring to the working people are not only reflected in the fact that members receive some price preferences, but mainly in the fact that their production and life are guaranteed and facilitated in various ways. It is true that members and non-members can also enjoy these benefits. However, the important difference between members and non-members is that members enjoy the right to manage the cooperative. They have the right to directly or through their elected representatives participate in the management and supervision of the cooperative, so that it can better meet their needs in accordance with the wishes and requirements of the members. In addition, according to the cooperative's articles of association, members can obtain dividends on shares; enjoy medical, cultural, health and other welfare facilities established by the cooperative with public welfare funds; and enjoy the right to prioritize purchasing and selling certain commodities and price preferences in certain seasons (such as the Spring Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival) or under certain conditions, which non-members cannot enjoy.

Adjusting cooperative retail prices nationwide is an arduous and complex task. It will have a certain impact on the economic life of the vast number of working people; if deviations occur, it may also cause dissatisfaction among members and create some chaos in the market. Cooperatives at all levels must, under the leadership of party committees at all levels, carefully and step by step do this work well. The first thing is to do a good job of publicity and explanation to the vast number of cadres and members. Cooperatives at all levels, especially grassroots cooperatives, should use various cadre meetings and member representative meetings to deeply publicize the significance of price adjustments, combine with the specific facts of the local area, discuss the purpose and tasks of supply and marketing cooperatives, study what the fundamental interests of members participating in supply and marketing cooperatives are, summarize the various benefits that cooperatives bring to members, explain the rights and obligations of members, and explain the special preferences that members can still enjoy after the price preferences for members are abolished, and so on. Combined with this year's year-end accounting, grassroots cooperatives in various places must carry out dividend distribution of shares in accordance with the regulations, which is a very favorable condition for adjusting prices. Grassroots cooperatives should use these favorable conditions to eliminate the concerns of some cadres and members and ensure that this important economic measure is correctly and smoothly implemented and carried out.

### 供销合作社应该调整零售价格

    供销合作社应该调整零售价格
    全国各地供销合作社执行去年七月全国合作社第一次代表大会的决定，正在逐步调整零售价格；最近全国供销合作总社又发出指示，要求各地合作社在二月十五日以前把零售价格调整到国营商业牌价的水平。从此以后，供销合作社的零售价格将和国营商业牌价取得一致，供销合作社对社员实行的价格优待要停止了。
    几年以来，大部分地区的合作社一直是按照低于牌价的原则来确定零售价格，对社员实行价格上的优待。这种作法曾经是完全必要和完全正确的。我们国家在经济恢复时期，农村旧的商业网已被破坏，新的商业网尚未形成，全国商业处在比较呆滞的状态；当时社会主义商业还很弱小，无论在批发市场或零售市场上都没有取得优势，私人商业资本还有可能操纵市场价格，进行投机倒把，剥削城乡生产者和消费者。在这种情况下，广大农民和城市居民的迫切要求是活跃城乡经济，减少中间剥削。供销合作社除了积极开展供销业务以满足社员的供销需要外，在价格上采取“低于市价供应，合理价格收购”的原则来优待社员，这就限制和减少了私商的中间剥削，协助国营商业稳定了物价，保护了城乡劳动人民的利益。合作社在群众中的威信提高了，劳动人民纷纷参加合作社，全国供销合作社和消费合作社迅速发展成为包括几万万劳动人民的商业组织。从一九五三年开始，国家先后实行粮食、棉布、油料统购统销和棉花统购以后，国家掌握了主要的货源，公私商业比重和整个市场关系发生了根本性质的变化；在批发商业中，私人资本基本上已被排除；在零售市场上，国营商业和合作社商业已经取得优势，供销合作社基本上控制了农村市场，私人零售商已不能像过去一样操纵市场和玩弄价格了。这就是说，供销合作社对社员实行价格优待的必要性已经消失，把零售价格提到国营商业牌价水平的可能性已经具备了。
    合作社调整零售价格是有利于国家积累工业化资金的。过去几年，国家为了扶植供销合作社的发展，曾在税收、批发价格、贷款、运输等方面给以优待。国营商业批发给供销合作社的商品，比一般批发价优待百分之二至六，平均约为百分之三点九，仅这一项，在一九五四年就有一万六千三百多亿元。国家逐步取消对合作社的这些优待，就能节省一批资金，投到工业建设上去。把这批资金分散给每个社员，数目很少，但集中起来，它可能发挥的作用就很大。积累必要的资金，实现国家的工业化，这是全国人民，当然也是全体合作社社员的最高利益，这种措施将要获得全体合作社社员的拥护，是毫无疑问的。
    合作社调整零售价格，还可以推动合作社改善经营管理，提高为社员服务的工作质量。过去合作社接受国家给予的各种优待，对发展供销业务起了很大的作用；但另一方面，一部分合作社干部的供给制思想也因而滋长起来，他们不重视经济核算和合理积累，以致有些合作社发生了赔钱现象。现在国家逐步停止对合作社的优待，合作社就不能再利用国家的优待弥补经营中的亏损，就必须加强经营管理和改善服务态度，不断地扩大供销业务和逐步增加积累，这就有利于供销合作社的巩固和提高。
    有人说：如果合作社的价格不比国营商业价格便宜，参加合作社还有什么好处呢？社员买东西和非社员出一样的价钱，社员和非社员不是没有区别了么？因此，他们耽心没有入社的群众再不会入社，有些社员却可能要求退社。这种认识是不够全面的。
    大家知道，组织供销合作社和消费合作社的主要目的，即供销合作社和消费合作社的主要任务，是通过供销业务和消费业务，为农业生产服务，为劳动人民的消费服务。劳动人民组织合作社，绝不是为了营利，也不仅仅是为了能买价钱便宜的东西；他们的根本要求是把合作社办好，以满足自己在生产上和生活上的需要。过去的事实证明：合作社带给劳动人民的好处，绝不仅仅表现在社员取得若干价格优待，而主要表现在他们的生产、生活得到各种保障和便利。不错，社员和非社员同样可以得到这些好处。但是，社员和非社员的重要区别，就是社员享有管理合作社的权利，他们有权利直接的或经过自己选出的代表，参加管理和监督合作社，使它能够按照社员的意愿和要求，更好地满足自己的需要。此外，按照合作社社章规定，社员可以取得股金分红；享受合作社以公益金举办的医药、文化、卫生等福利设施；在一定季节（如春节和中秋节）或一定条件下，享受若干种商品优先购销和价格优待的权利，这些都是非社员享受不到的。
    在全国范围内调整合作社零售价格，是一项艰巨复杂的工作。它对广大劳动人民的经济生活会发生一定的影响；如果发生偏差，还可能引起社员的不满和造成市场上的某些混乱。各级合作社必须在各级党委领导下，慎重地有步骤地做好这项工作，首先是向广大干部和社员作好宣传解释工作。各级合作社，特别是基层合作社，应该通过各种干部会议和社员代表大会，深入地宣传调整价格的意义，结合当地的具体事实，讨论供销合作社的目的和任务，研究什么是社员参加供销社的根本利益，总结合作社带给社员的多方面的利益，讲解社员的权利和义务，说明取消对社员的价格优待后社员仍可享受的特殊优待，等等。各地基层社结合今年度的年终决算，都要按章进行股金分红，这对调整价格是很有利的条件。基层社应该运用这些有利条件，消除某些干部和社员的疑虑，保证这项重要的经济措施正确地和顺利地执行和贯彻。
