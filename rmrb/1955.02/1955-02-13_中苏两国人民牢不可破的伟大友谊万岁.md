Long Live the Great and Unbreakable Friendship Between the Chinese and Soviet Peoples

The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance is five years old. This treaty laid a solid foundation for comprehensive political, economic, and cultural cooperation between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. Over the past five years, the friendly mutual assistance and sincere cooperation between the governments and peoples of China and the Soviet Union have led to tremendous development in the economic and cultural relations between the two countries. In particular, the various forms of assistance provided by the Soviet Union to our country have played a significant role in China's economic recovery and large-scale construction during the First Five-Year Plan. Last October, the Soviet government delegation visited China, and during the visit, Sino-Soviet talks were held, and a joint communiqué was issued, which further advanced the friendly cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. Recently, the Soviet government decided to provide scientific, technological, and industrial assistance to China in promoting the research of peaceful uses of atomic energy. This fully demonstrates that the Soviet people are the most reliable and loyal friends of the Chinese people; the growing development and consolidation of the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples is a strong foundation for safeguarding peace in the Far East and the world.
