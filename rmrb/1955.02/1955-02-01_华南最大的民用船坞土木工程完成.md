    The civil engineering construction of the second dock of the Guangzhou Shipyard of the Ministry of Transportation has been basically completed. This dock is the largest civil dock in South China. All equipment is mechanized. Currently, the installation of machinery and equipment in the dock is proceeding intensely, and it is expected to be put into production in the second quarter of this year.

    Before liberation, there was no well-equipped dock in South China that could repair and build large oceangoing vessels. As a result, many oceangoing vessels were poorly maintained due to age, had very low equipment utilization rates, small cargo capacities, and slow sailing speeds. After this dock is put into production, it will be able to undertake the repair and construction tasks of oceangoing vessels along the South China coast.

    华南最大的民用船坞土木工程完成
    交通部广州船舶修造厂第二船坞的土木建筑工程已基本完成。这个船坞是华南最大的民用船坞。全部设备都是机械化的。目前，正紧张进行船坞的机器设备安装工程，预计今年第二季度可以投入生产。
    解放前，华南地区没有一个设备较完善的、能修造大型海轮的船坞。因此不少海轮因年久失修设备利用率很低，载重量小，航行速度也慢。这个船坞投入生产后，就可担负起华南沿海的海轮修造任务。
