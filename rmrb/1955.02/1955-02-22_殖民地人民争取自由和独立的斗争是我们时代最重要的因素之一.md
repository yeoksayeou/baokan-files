    The Struggle of Colonial Peoples for Freedom and Independence is One of the Most Important Factors of Our Time
    Soviet Union, Si. Datelin
    According to established practice, February 21st of each year has been designated as the International Day for the Struggle Against Colonialism.
    Closely related to this day are two famous dates: the uprising of Indian sailors in the British fleet in 1946 and the great demonstration of the Egyptian people in 1947. To commemorate these events, February 21st has become a day for the solidarity of progressive humanity around the world with the colonial and semi-colonial peoples who are striving for freedom, independence, and a peaceful life.
    The colonial national liberation movement is one of the most important world historical processes of our time. The great October Socialist Revolution became a tremendous force in promoting its development. This revolution instilled confidence in the enslaved nations and made them believe that they could break free from the shackles of oppression. After the Second World War, the national liberation movement, like a flame, swept through all oppressed and dependent countries. The national liberation movement has a large scale in Asia, on the islands of the Pacific, and in Africa. Hundreds of millions of people who are unwilling to live in the old ways and are unwilling to tolerate the enslavement of colonialists have joined the national liberation struggle.
    If, in the pre-war period, most struggles against the colonial system usually ended in the defeat of the insurgent people, or, in better cases, with insignificant concessions from the colonialists, then now the people of colonial and dependent countries no longer feel powerless in the face of the armies of colonial countries. Recent experience has taught them, making them aware of their own strength, and convinced that as long as the strength of the entire people is united, they can break free from the shackles of imperialist enslavement and achieve national independence. The struggle of the colonial people has a characteristic of being bound to win.
    The Chinese People's Revolution dealt a fatal blow to imperialism and was the most significant historical event in the world after the October Socialist Revolution. The great Chinese people, accounting for a quarter of the world's total population, completely shattered imperialist rule over China and achieved complete national independence.
    The people of North Korea and Vietnam have gained independence after significant sacrifices. After a long period of struggle, the people of India, Indonesia, and Burma established their own independent and autonomous countries, with a combined population of approximately 500 million.
    The national independence of Syria, Lebanon, and other countries has also been recognized.
    In countries such as Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Kenya, and Malaya, the foundations of the colonial system are being shaken more and more strongly.
    The ideas of freedom and independence have also penetrated deeply into the consciousness of the broad masses of the people in Latin America.
    The liberation movement of oppressed nations has gone far beyond the scope of local and isolated struggles. If, in the past, every nation fought alone in the struggle against colonial oppression, now almost all the people of the colonial world have been drawn into the struggle. The national liberation movement in colonial and dependent countries has become the most important international factor, and the fate of this movement is closely linked with the major events in current international life.
    The colonial world is constantly shrinking. The territory that monopolists can plunder is getting smaller and smaller. Under these circumstances, the competition between colonial countries for the remaining colonies and spheres of influence has become drastically intensified.
    It has long been no secret that the monopoly capitalists of the United States are ambitiously attempting to seize all sources of raw materials and world markets. Colonial expansion is one of the main links in the aggressive policy of the United States to seize world hegemony. Therefore, it is no accident that the ruling groups of the United States have assumed the role of world police and stranglers of the national liberation movement. Under the guise of "joint struggle against communism," American imperialism is piecing together so-called "defense groups" in various parts of the world.
    These "defense groups" are merely a guise for American aggression groups, used to disguise their plundering policies, ignite hatred among nations, and conspire to undermine the liberation movement in the colonies.
    Last year, with the support of Britain and France, the United States pieced together the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. The purpose of this treaty is to restore and maintain the colonial system in Asian countries. The United States government also concluded a military alliance with Chiang Kai-shek to oppose the People's Republic of China, and is stubbornly attempting to undermine the Geneva Conference resolutions on Indochina.
    In the Near East, American imperialists are using every possible means of threat and enticement to drag Arab countries into military blocs under its protection, in order to use the territories and residents of these countries to invade other peace-loving countries.
    French colonialists are carrying out bloody suppression of the people of Tunisia, Morocco, and Algeria with the blessings of American bankers and generals.
    In Latin American countries, agents of American monopoly capitalists are constantly organizing coups to overthrow governments that are not to their liking.
    The people of those young countries that have recently gained national independence, as well as the people of countries still under the yoke of the colonial system, are increasingly aware that their interests and the struggle of all progressive humanity for peace, for the right of each country to be independent, to control its own destiny and its own resources, are indivisible. They refuse to be fooled by the myth of a "communist threat." They correctly see the real threat in the construction of foreign military bases on their land and in the conspiracies to lure their countries into military blocs. Isn't the establishment of American military bases in other people's countries precisely a violation of their independence? Isn't it obvious that the military alliances pieced together by imperialists are only to maintain imperialism and the colonial system?
    The events of the past year have proved that in Asian and African countries, the movement to establish a broad united front of all nations against colonialism, racial discrimination, aggressive blocs, and for friendly cooperation between nations and to safeguard world peace and security is constantly growing. Based on the initiative of the prime ministers of India, Indonesia, Burma, Ceylon, and Pakistan in Southeast Asia, the Asian-African Conference will be held in Bandung, Indonesia in April 1955. The task of the conference is to promote the cause of peace in the world and the social and economic development of Asian and African countries. The People's Republic of China, Lebanon, Egypt, Japan, Syria, Libya, the Central African Federation, and many other countries in these two continents have been invited to participate in this conference. Convening this conference shows that the people of Asia and Africa are determined to independently resolve the problems they face, the most important of which are maintaining peace, striving for complete national independence, and improving the people's living standards.
    Asian newspapers insistently emphasize that the conference should declare to the American aggressive bloc: Stop interfering in Asia!
    The cause of national liberation does not develop smoothly along a broad road. Imperialist colonialists will not hesitate to take any criminal act in order to maintain the privilege of exploiting millions of colonial slaves.
    However, history will never develop according to the will of those who order it to stagnate and forcibly drag humanity's future back to yesterday. The movement of people striving for freedom, independence, and peace has now become invincible. It is opening up wonderful prospects that inspire the further rise of modern culture.
    Progressive people all over the world are loyally and closely united with the people who are waging a heroic struggle to liberate themselves from the shackles of colonialism.

### 殖民地人民争取自由和独立的斗争是我们时代最重要的因素之一

    殖民地人民争取自由和独立的斗争是我们时代最重要的因素之一
    苏联  斯·达特林
    根据确立了的惯例，每年的二月二十一日已被定为反对殖民制度的国际斗争日。
    同这一天密切相关联的是两个著名的日期：一九四六年英国舰队中印度水兵的起义和一九四七年埃及人民的大示威。为了纪念这些事件，二月二十一日就成为全世界进步人类同争取自由、独立与和平生活的殖民地、半殖民地人民大团结的日子。
    殖民地民族解放运动乃是我们时代最重要的世界历史进程之一。伟大的十月社会主义革命成为推动它的发展的巨大力量，这次革命使被奴役的民族产生了信心，使他们相信他们自己能够摆脱压迫的枷锁。第二次世界大战之后，民族解放运动像火焰一样，燃遍了所有被压迫的和附属国家。民族解放运动在亚洲，在太平洋的群岛上，在非洲，都有很大的规模。亿万不愿意再按照旧方式生活下去，不愿意再容忍殖民者的奴役的人们，都加入了民族解放斗争。
    如果在战前时期大部分反抗殖民制度的斗争通常地都以起义人民的失败，或是在较好的情况下，以殖民者的微不足道的让步而告终的话，那么，现在殖民地和附属国家的人民在殖民国家的军队面前已不再感觉自己是无能为力的了。近年来的经验教育了他们使他们意识到了自己的力量，并确信只要团结全民的力量，他们就能够摆脱帝国主义奴役的羁绊，并争取到民族的独立。殖民地人民的斗争已具有必胜的特征。
    中国的人民革命给帝国主义带来了致命的打击，这是继十月社会主义革命之后世界上最重大的历史事件。占全地球总人口四分之一的伟大的中国人民彻底地粉碎了帝国主义对中国的统治，并取得了完全的民族独立。
    北朝鲜和越南的人民经过重大的牺牲获得了独立。印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸人民在经过长期斗争之后建立了自己独立自主的国家，它们的人口加在一起约计五亿。
    叙利亚、黎巴嫩和其它一些国家的民族独立也得到了承认。
    在这样一些国家里，像突尼斯、摩洛哥，阿尔及利亚、怯尼亚、马来亚等，殖民制度的基础正日益受到强烈的摇撼。
    自由和独立的思想也已深入到拉丁美洲广大人民群众的意识中。
    被压迫民族的解放运动，已经远远地突出了地方性的和孤立的范畴。如果说，过去每一个民族曾在反殖民压迫的斗争中孤军奋战，那么，现在几乎整个殖民地世界的各族人民都已卷入到斗争中来。殖民地与附属国的民族解放运动业已成为最重大的国际因素，而且这个运动的命运是同当前国际生活中的主要事件紧密地连接在一起的。
    殖民地的世界不断地缩小着。垄断资本家掠夺的地盘越来越少了。在这种情况之下，殖民国家为了剩余的殖民地和势力范围而进行的竞争便剧烈地尖锐化起来。
    美国的垄断资本家野心勃勃地企图侵占一切原料产地和世界市场，这早就不是什么秘密了。殖民主义的扩张乃是美国攫取世界霸权的侵略政策中的主要环节之一。因此，正是由美国统治集团来承当世界宪兵和民族解放运动的绞杀者的角色，这并不是偶然的。在“跟共产主义进行共同斗争”的幌子之下，美国帝国主义在世界的各个部分拼凑所谓
  “防御集团”。
    这些“防御集团”仅仅是作为美国侵略集团的幌子，用来伪装他们的掠夺政策、燃起各民族间的仇意和阴谋破坏殖民地的解放运动。
    去年，美国在英国和法国的支持之下拼凑了侵略性的东南亚公约。这个公约的目的就是要在亚洲国家中恢复和维护殖民制度。美国政府还同蒋介石缔结了军事联盟，以反对中华人民共和国，并正顽固地企图破坏日内瓦会议关于印度支那的决议。
    在近东，美国帝国主义者竭尽威胁利诱的能事，企图把阿拉伯国家拖进在它保护下的军事集团，以便利用这些国家的领土和居民去侵略其它爱好和平的国家。
    法国殖民者正带着美国银行家和将军们的祝福，对突尼斯、摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚的人民进行血腥的镇压。
    在拉丁美洲的国家，那些美国垄断资本家的代理人不断组织政变，来推翻那些为他们所不中意的政府。
    那些不久前才获得民族独立的年青国家的人民，以及还处在殖民制度奴役之下的国家的人民，都愈来愈清楚地知道，他们的利益和全体进步人类争取和平，争取每个国家独立，支配自己的命运和自己资源的权利的斗争是不可分割的。他们不愿为“共产主义威胁”的神话所愚弄。他们从外国军事基地建筑在他们的土地上，从企图把他们的国家诱入军事集团的阴谋中，正确地看到当前的真正威胁。难道在别人的国家里建立美国的军事基地不正是破坏了它的独立吗？帝国主义者所拼凑的军事联盟，仅仅是为了维护帝国主义和殖民制度，这难道还不明显吗？
    最近一年所发生的事件证明，在亚洲和非洲国家内，建立各民族广泛的统一战线以反对殖民主义、宗族歧视、侵略集团和争取各民族间友好合作关系、维护全世界和平与安全的运动正在不断地增长。依据东南亚的印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、锡兰和巴基斯坦等五国总理的倡议，一九五五年四月，将要在印度尼西亚的万隆召开亚非国家会议。会议的任务是要促进全世界的和平事业与亚非国家社会和经济的发展。被邀参加这个会议的有中华人民共和国、黎巴嫩、埃及、日本、叙利亚、利比亚、中非联邦以及这两大洲的其它许多国家。召开这个会议说明，亚非人民坚决要求独立自主地解决自己所面临的问题，这些问题中最主要的是，维护和平、争取完全的民族独立和提高人民的生活水平。
    亚洲的报刊坚持地强调，会议应该向美国侵略集团声明：停止干涉亚洲！
    民族解放事业不是沿着康庄大道一往直前地发展的。帝国主义殖民者为了要维护剥削千百万殖民地奴隶的特权，是不惜采取任何罪恶行为的。
    但是，历史决不会按照那些喝令它停滞不前和强把人类的将来拉回到昨天的日子里去的人们的意志而发展的。争取自由、独立与和平的人民运动现在已成为不可战胜的了。它正打开着鼓舞现代文化进一步高涨的美好的远景。
    全世界的进步人士是忠诚地、亲密地同正在进行着英勇斗争以争取从殖民主义的枷锁中解放出来的人民团结一致的。
