    Hubei's Water and Land Transportation Resumes

    Hubei Province has rapidly restored its water and land transportation operations.

    Around New Year's Day this year, Hubei Province was hit by the most severe cold and ice since meteorological records began in 1886. Highways that had just been repaired after being destroyed by floods were covered again by more than a foot of snow; all rivers and lakes except the Yangtze River were frozen. Water and land transportation was greatly hindered. In order to overcome the difficulties of ice and snow and complete the heavy urban and rural transportation tasks before and after the Spring Festival, Party committees and people's governments at all levels in Hubei Province promptly mobilized hundreds of thousands of people along the rivers and roads, organized snow-clearing vehicles and icebreaking fleets, and carried a large number of yellow explosives and hand grenades to carry out snow-clearing and ice-breaking work. After about twenty days of arduous day and night struggle, except for individual branch lines that are still under construction, the highways have basically returned to normal traffic; the largest river traversing northwestern Hubei, the Han River, has also been completely unfrozen. At present, tense and busy transportation work has begun again on the 13,000-kilometer water and land transportation lines.

    According to preliminary statistics from the Hubei Provincial Transportation Command: in less than ten days in January, nearly 30,000 tons of grain and various Spring Festival supplies were transported from the Han River to disaster areas and other rural areas, ensuring the normal supply of Spring Festival materials in various places. Due to the rapid restoration of water and land transportation, transportation plans submitted to the Hubei Provincial Transportation Command by provincial material units alone amount to more than 200,000 tons in February. Among them, more than 100,000 tons of bricks, tiles, ash, stone, wood, and other materials will be transported to Wuhan to support the needs of industrial capital construction and embankment projects in the Wuhan area; more than 20,000 tons of grain will be transported from Wuhan to supply industrial and mining areas and some disaster areas in Hubei Province; in addition, more than 12,000 tons of early rice seeds will be transported from Wuhan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and other places to Jingzhou, Xiaogan, Huanggang, and other special districts in Hubei Province to support farmers in disaster areas in spring plowing. (Ji Zhuoru) Farmers enthusiastically welcome the "May 3rd" type walking plow.

    The "May 3rd" type walking plow created by technician Li Jiqun and workers of the Liuzhou Machinery Factory in Guangxi Province has been enthusiastically welcomed by the majority of farmers.

    The advantages of the "May 3rd" type walking plow are: the curvature of the plowshare and the soil turning angle can be flexibly adjusted, and the width of the plow surface can be increased or decreased, solving the different requirements of various soil types for the plowshare; the plow support part—the plowshare, plow moldboard, plow side plate, plow column, and plow knife—is simple in structure, easy to assemble and disassemble, and does not have the problem of rusting; the plow knife is new-style and easy to use. This type of walking plow can plow various paddy fields and dry land, and can also reclaim wasteland. Its tillage efficiency is 25 percent higher than the local old plow, it is more sturdy than the old plow, it can plow deeply, it turns the soil more thoroughly than the old plow, it plows the bottom of the field flat, and it is more stable and easier to master than the old plow.

    Technicians and workers of the Liuzhou Machinery Factory began to study and improve paddy field plows in the winter of 1952. Under the guidance of the Guangxi Provincial Department of Industry and the Department of Agriculture, and with the support of the factory's Party committee, after dozens of improvements and more than one hundred tests, they finally preliminarily created it successfully in 1953. After the successful trial, they also sent the "May 3rd" type walking plow to farms in Liuzhou, Nanning, Baise, and farmers in various parts of Guangxi Province for trial use, which was enthusiastically welcomed. By the end of 1954, more than 10,000 "May 3rd" type walking plows had been promoted. Recently, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, Guizhou, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Henan, Xikang and other provinces have sent telegrams or letters to Liuzhou requesting supply. The Guangxi Provincial Department of Industry sent special personnel to Changsha, Hunan and rural areas in Guangxi in December last year to try out the "May 3rd" type walking plow, and is now further improving it, striving to finalize the design as soon as possible.

    湖北水陆交通恢复
    湖北省已经迅速恢复了水路和陆路的交通运输工作。
    今年元旦前后，湖北省遭到了自从一八八六年有气象纪录以来最大的严寒冰冻。被洪水冲毁的公路刚刚修复，又被一尺多深的积雪覆盖；河道湖泊除长江以外全部冰封。水、陆交通受到极大的阻碍。为了克服冰雪封冻的困难，完成春节前后繁重的城乡运输任务，湖北省各级党委和人民政府及时动员了沿河、沿路的数十万群众，组织了铲雪汽车，破冰船队，携带大批黄色炸药和手榴弹，展开了扫雪破冰工作。经过二十天左右的日夜艰苦斗争，公路除个别支线正在修筑以外，其他已经基本恢复正常的交通；贯穿鄂西北的最大河流——汉水，也已经全部解除冰冻。目前，在一万三千余公里的水、陆交通运输线上，又开始了紧张、繁忙的运输工作。
    根据湖北省交通运输指挥部的初步统计：在一月份不到十天的时间内，光从汉江运向灾区和其他农村的粮食和各种春节物资就将近有三万吨，保证了各地春节物资的正常供应。由于水、陆交通的迅速恢复，二月份内，仅省级各物资单位向湖北省交通运输指挥部提出的运输计划，就有二十多万吨。其中将有十万多吨的砖、瓦、灰、石、木料等运送到武汉市来，支援武汉地区工业基本建设和堤防工程的需要；将从武汉市运出两万多吨粮食供应湖北省工矿区和部分灾区；另外，还有一万二千多吨早稻种子，将从武汉、湖南、江西等地运送到湖北省的荆州、孝感、黄冈等专区，支援灾区农民进行春耕生产。　（纪卓如）农民热烈欢迎“五三”型步犁
    广西省柳州机械厂技术员李济群和工人们创造的“五三”型步犁，受到广大农民的热烈欢迎。
    “五三”型步犁的优点是：犁镜弯度和拨土角度能灵活调节，犁面宽窄可以增减，解决了各种土质对犁镜的不同要求；犁托部分——犁铧、犁镜、犁侧板、犁柱、犁刀等结构简单，装拆容易，并且没有锈死的毛病；犁刀是新式的，使用简便。用这种步犁可以犁各种水田、旱地，还能开荒。它的耕作效率比当地旧犁提高百分之二十五，比旧犁坚固，能深耕，翻土比旧犁彻底，田底犁得平，比旧犁稳定，容易掌握。
    柳州机械厂技术员和工人们从一九五二年冬季开始研究改进水田犁，他们在广西省工业厅和农业厅的指导下，在工厂党委的支持下，经过几十次的改进和一百多次的试验，终于在一九五三年初步创造成功。试验成功后，他们还把“五三”型步犁送到柳州、南宁、百色各农场及广西省各地农民试用，受到热烈欢迎。到一九五四年底，“五三”型步犁已推广一万多架。最近，江西、广东、湖南、湖北、贵州、浙江、四川、陕西、河南、西康等省，都打电报或写信来柳州要求供应。广西省工业厅在去年十二月间曾派出专人到湖南长沙和广西各地农村去试用“五三”型步犁，现正进一步改进，争取早日定型。（江澜）
