Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 18th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru returned to New Delhi on the evening of the 17th after attending the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in London.

    According to the Indian Information Bureau, Nehru, speaking to reporters at the airport, welcomed a Geneva-style conference to discuss the situation in the Taiwan area. Nehru said he liked Geneva-style conferences and indicated that India was willing to "take the initiative" in "informal contacts" before the meeting, if necessary. Nehru also said that he never insisted that anyone "participate or not participate" in such a meeting; he said that it was necessary to find some way to discuss the issue peacefully.

    Prior to this, Nehru told reporters at Bombay Airport on his way back to Delhi: "A conference on the Taiwan issue will probably be held sooner or later. But before holding such a formal meeting, it is advisable and necessary to conduct informal contacts to prepare the ground for the meeting." He also said: "Although we do not intend to take the lead, we will certainly help if we can help facilitate such a meeting."

    When someone mentioned Washington news reports that certain Colombo countries might be persuaded to attend the upcoming Southeast Asia Treaty Organization Bangkok conference, he said: "I cannot speak for others, but as far as India is concerned, we will definitely not go there."

    Nehru also told those asking questions that the Asian-African Conference has nothing to do with the Taiwan issue.
    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 19th, TASS: Prime Minister Nehru returned here on February 17th.

    The Prime Minister issued a statement to the press at the airport, emphasizing the need for a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue. When a reporter asked whether Chiang Kai-shek might send a representative to a possible conference to discuss the Taiwan issue, Nehru replied that India did not recognize the Taiwan government (Chiang Kai-shek's group) and did not insist that this or that country must send a representative to the meeting. Nehru said he favored holding a Geneva-style conference to discuss the Indochina issue.

    Earlier, Nehru emphasized the appropriateness of convening a conference to discuss the Taiwan issue during a brief stopover in Bombay. He pointed out that India would assist in convening such a meeting, and he also emphasized that, as far as the Indian government is concerned, it has recognized the People's Government of China and does not recognize Taiwan as an independent country, believing it is only a part of China.

    尼赫鲁总理就讨论台湾局势问题发表谈话
    【新华社新德里十八日电】印度总理尼赫鲁在伦敦参加了英联邦总理会议之后，已在十七日晚间返回新德里。
    据印度新闻处报道，尼赫鲁在机场向记者发表谈话时，表示欢迎举行日内瓦式的会议来讨论台湾地区局势问题。尼赫鲁说他喜欢日内瓦式的会议，并且表示印度在必要时愿意在会前“进行非正式接洽”中“采取主动”。尼赫鲁又说：他从没有坚持任何人“参加或不参加”这种会议，他所说的是必须找到某种办法，以便可以和平地来讨论问题。
    在此以前，尼赫鲁在返回德里途中在孟买机场上向记者发表谈话说：“关于台湾问题的会议大概迟早总要举行。但是在举行这种正式会议以前，进行非正式的接触以便为会议准备基础是可取的和必要的”。他又说：“虽然我们无意率先行动，但是只要我们能帮助促成这样一个会议，我们是一定会进行帮助的。”
    当有人提到华盛顿消息传闻某些科伦坡国家可能会被说服出席即将召开的东南亚防御条约组织曼谷会议时，他说：“我不能代别人说话，但是就印度而言，我们根本不会到那里去。”
    尼赫鲁还对提问题的人说：亚非会议同台湾问题没有关系。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社新德里十九日电：尼赫鲁总理于二月十七日回到这里。
    总理在机场上向报界发表一篇声明，强调和平解决台湾问题的必要性。有记者问他蒋介石是否可能派代表出席可能召开的讨论台湾问题的会议，尼赫鲁答道，印度并不承认台湾政府（蒋介石集团），而且并不坚持主张一定要这个或那个国家派代表出席会议。尼赫鲁说，他赞成举行一次讨论印度支那问题的日内瓦会议式的会议。
    前此，尼赫鲁在途经孟买稍作停留的时候，着重指出召开一次讨论台湾问题的会议是相宜的。他指出印度将协助召开这样一个会议，他同时强调，就印度政府来说，它已承认了中国的人民政府，而并没有承认台湾是一个独立的国家，认为它只不过是中国的一部分。
