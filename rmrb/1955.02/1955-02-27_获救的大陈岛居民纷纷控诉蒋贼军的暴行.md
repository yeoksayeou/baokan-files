Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang Front, February 26th: Rescued Dachen Island residents, who were saved by the People's Liberation Army from the barren islands near Dachen Island, are accusing the Chiang bandit troops of their crimes.

	Eighty-year-old Kong Jiangpo said: "Fishermen live by fishing. But when the Chiang bandit troops were on Dachen Island, they restricted us from going out to sea to fish. They stipulated that we could go out to sea in the morning, but we had to return in the afternoon. Once, my son, Kong Zhaode, was arrested and imprisoned for a day because he came back late from fishing." Wang Qichang, a fisherman from Huangfu Reef, said: "Since November of last year, the Chiang bandit troops have 'sealed the port' and do not allow fishermen to go out to sea to fish at all." Wang Qichang also said: "In July last year, eight fishermen on the island, including Ma Sanxian, Ma Lingfeng, and Chen Daogang, were arrested by the Chiang bandit troops because they lost their membership cards for the Fishermen's Association (an organization used by the Chiang bandits to control the fishermen of Dachen Island), and their whereabouts are still unknown." Tailor Zheng Kaimei and teahouse worker Lin Ziqing both said that when the Chiang bandit troops occupied the island, secret agents wearing short guns roamed the streets all day long, arresting people at will. Lin Ziqing said: "When the People's Liberation Army's planes bombed Upper Dachen Island, I said, 'They don't bomb the houses of ordinary people,' and at two o'clock that night, the police arrested me. The Chiang bandit troops beat me and wanted to execute me, insisting that I was in communication with the People's Liberation Army. They really made Dachen Island a place of utter darkness!"

	Zheng Kaimei and photographer Lin Mingyao also accused the Chiang bandit troops of arbitrarily extorting money from the people. Zheng Kaimei said: "Last year, I made a suit of clothes for a Chiang bandit military officer, and we agreed on a labor cost of 25 yuan in bogus Taiwan currency, but he only gave me 15 yuan." Lin Mingyao said: "In July the year before last, a group of Chiang bandit troops asked me to take pictures for them. After the photos were taken, they insisted that I had deliberately photographed the port and wharf, exposing 'military secrets.' They took the photos away, not only did not pay me, but also arrested me and detained me for a month and three days. Later, my family asked many people to bail me out." They said that the Chiang bandit troops also extorted money from the residents under more than a dozen pretexts such as "business tax," "military consolation fees," and "township construction fees."

	These rescued people also revealed the Chiang bandit troops' looting of the people of Dachen Island when they fled. Kong Jiangpo said: "My old in-law, Liang Kaichong, is seventy-six years old. Because he was unwilling to go to Taiwan with the Chiang bandit troops, he was arrested by the Chiang bandit troops and locked in an air-raid shelter, and was eventually dragged away. My son cried for two days before leaving. In those days, there was weeping in every village and every household."

    获救的大陈岛居民纷纷控诉蒋贼军的暴行
    【新华社浙江前线二十六日电】被人民解放军部队从大陈岛附近的荒岛上解救出来的大陈岛居民，纷纷控诉蒋贼军的罪行。
    八十岁的老人孔江坡说：“渔民是靠捕鱼生活的。可是蒋贼军在大陈岛时限制我们出海捕鱼。规定上午出海，下午一定要回来。我儿子孔招德有一次因为打鱼回来晚了一些，就被他们抓去蹲了一天监牢。”黄夫礁的渔民王其昌说：“从去年十一月起，蒋贼军‘封港’了，根本不许渔民出海捕鱼。”王其昌还说：“去年七月，岛上的渔民马三仙、马领风、陈道刚等八个人，因为把渔会（蒋贼统治大陈岛渔民的一种组织）会员证丢掉了，结果被蒋贼军抓去，到现在还不知下落。”裁缝郑楷梅和浴室的茶房林子清都说，蒋贼军盘踞岛上的时候，特务们一天到晚佩着短枪满街跑，任意抓人。林子清说：“人民解放军的飞机轰炸上大陈岛的时候，我说了一句‘老百姓的房子它不炸’，当天夜里两点钟，警察就把我抓去了。蒋贼军打我，要枪毙我，硬说我通解放军。他们把大陈岛上弄得真是暗无天日！”
    郑楷梅和照像师林明瑶还控诉蒋贼军警任意勒索人民的罪行。郑楷梅说：“去年我给一个蒋贼军军官做了一套衣服，讲好二十五元伪台币的工钱，可是他只给了十五元。”林明瑶说：“前年七月，一伙蒋贼军要我给他们照像，照好后他们硬说我故意把港口、码头拍上了，暴露了‘军事机密’，把照片拿去了，不光不给钱，反把我抓去关押了一个月零三天。后来我家里托了许多人才把我保出来。”他们说，蒋贼军还借所谓“商业税”、“劳军费”、“乡政事业费”等十几种名目，勒索居民的钱财。
    这些获救的人民还揭发了蒋贼军撤逃时对大陈岛人民的劫掠罪行。孔江坡说：“我的老亲家梁开崇七十六岁了，因为不愿跟蒋贼军到台湾去，被蒋贼军抓去关在防空洞里，最后还是被拖了去。我儿子临走时哭了两天。那几天各庄各户都是一片哭声。”
