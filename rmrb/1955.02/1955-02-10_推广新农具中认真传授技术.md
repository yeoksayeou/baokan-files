Shanxi Province is actively promoting new-style farm tools in various rural areas. In 1954, the province promoted a total of 1,500 double-wheeled double-share plows, more than 14,000 new-style walking plows, 7,000 waterwheels, more than 8,500 pieces of agricultural machinery and equipment, and more than 21,000 sprayers. In the process of promoting new-style farm tools, various localities have conscientiously implemented the principle of closely integrating the promotion of new-style farm tools with technical guidance. Last autumn, when focusing on promoting 1,500 double-wheeled double-share plows, 785 technical cadres were trained through short-term technical training courses. After training, these cadres generally understood all the repair and usage techniques of the double-wheeled double-share plow. After graduation, they went deep into the countryside to impart techniques to farmers on various occasions and promoted the benefits of the double-wheeled double-share plow through field experiments. After the Xinjiang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative used five double-wheeled double-share plows for exhibition and experimentation, the Songcun, Liuquan, and Sunjiayuan agricultural production cooperatives bought four, and the Zhongcun and other agricultural production cooperatives also signed pre-purchase contracts with the supply and marketing cooperative for eleven plows. The double-wheeled double-share plows promoted in this way were quickly put into the autumn plowing movement.

This year, it is planned to promote 20,000 double-wheeled double-share plows, 1,000 cultivators, 200 row seeders, 200 harvesters, 5 threshers, 10,000 new-style walking plows, and other new-style farm tools. In order to do this work well, the Shanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture convened a farm tool conference on February 4 to jointly study and arrange this year's promotion of new-style farm tools with relevant departments. The conference requested that the industrial sector manufacture well, the supply and marketing cooperatives manage well, the promotion stations promote well, the techniques be imparted well, and the problem of parts repair and matching be solved well. The conference also formulated the "Draft on the Imparting of Technology for New-Style Animal-Drawn Farm Tools," the "Operating Procedures for New-Style Animal-Drawn Farm Tools," and the "Agreement on the Production, Supply, Promotion, and Loan Support for Double-Wheeled Double-Share Plows by Various Departments." Now the promotion preparation work has been largely completed. It is estimated that 3,600 to 4,100 new double-wheeled double-share plows will be put into spring plowing production in the first quarter of this year.

    推广新农具中认真传授技术
    山西省各地农村积极推广新式农具。一九五四年，全省共推广双轮双铧犁一千五百部、新式步犁一万四千多张、水车七千部、农业药械八千五百多件，以及喷雾器二万一千多台。各地在推广新式农具的过程中，认真贯彻了推广新式农具与技术指导紧密结合的原则。去年秋季重点推广一千五百部双轮双铧犁的时候，先后通过短期技术训练班，训练了七百八十五名技术干部。这些干部经过训练，一般都懂得了双轮双铧犁的全部修理和使用技术；结业以后都深入农村利用各种场合向农民传授技术，通过实地实验，宣传了双轮双铧犁的好处。新绛县供销合作社用五部双轮双铧犁展览试验以后，宋村、柳泉、孙家院三个农业生产合作社就买了四部，中村等农业生产合作社也同供销合作社签订了购买十一部的预购合同。这样推广的双轮双铧犁，都很快地投入了秋耕运动。
    今年准备推广二万部双轮双铧犁、一千部中耕器、二百部条播器、二百部收割机、五部脱谷机、一万张新式步犁及其他新式农具。为了做好这一工作，山西省农业厅在二月四日召开了农具会议，同有关部门共同研究布置了今年新式农具的推广工作。会议要求工业部门制造好，供销合作社经营好，推广站推广好，把技术传授好，把零件修配问题解决好。会议还订出了“新式畜力农具技术传授草案”、“新式畜力农具技术操作规程”、“各部门生产、供应、推广和贷款支援双轮双铧犁协议书”。现在推广准备工作已经大致就绪。预计今年第一季度就要有三千六百部到四千一百部新双轮双铧犁投入春耕生产。
