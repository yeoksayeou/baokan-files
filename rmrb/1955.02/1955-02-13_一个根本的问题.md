    A Fundamental Problem
    By Our Reporter An Gang
    The fundamental reason for the repeated product quality accidents at the Shenyang Transformer Factory is the failure to fully establish the socialist ideology of leading production and the abandonment of the struggle against capitalist ideas. In the minds of some comrades, capitalist technical viewpoints are retained to varying degrees. People with this kind of thinking do not recognize the advanced nature of Soviet technology from the standpoint of Marxism-Leninism, but always doubt the Soviet Union, equating advanced things with backward things, glorifying this as creating their own "creations," but in reality, they are developing backward and conservative things. If this kind of thinking is not criticized and corrected, the factory will not be able to earnestly complete the task of comprehensively learning from the Soviet Union and ensuring the production of excellent products.
    An article written by Tang Mingqi, chief engineer of the Shenyang Transformer Factory, published in "Electrical Industry" in July 1954, can illustrate many problems. The article is entitled "How to Correctly Understand and Learn from the Advanced Product Design Experience of the Soviet Union," and the problems mentioned in the article are some fundamental views that have been debated within the factory for a long time without being correctly resolved.
      "Can our designed products be different from Soviet products?" This is a question raised by Tang Mingqi in the article. He criticized a view: "Some comrades now believe that our products must be 100% the same as Soviet products, and no parts are allowed to be different from Soviet products, otherwise it is a discount on the advanced design experience of the Soviet Union, which is 'not believing in the Soviet Union.'"
    But people want to ask, why not reverse the question and say: "Can our designed products be consistent with Soviet products?" For the Shenyang Transformer Factory, this is a question that should and must be answered first. Because, first, the transformer factory has possessed Soviet data for manufacturing transformers since 1952. If the factory director and chief engineer did not put aside some of these data, but truly mobilized all employees to study diligently, the factory could not have had continuous accidents, and it would definitely be able to produce products identical to Soviet products. In 1953, the parts production in the factory's metalworking workshop was very poor. The workshop cadres believed that the conditions were not sufficient to meet the tolerance requirements stipulated in the drawings. Technicians arbitrarily modified 100 drawings, resulting in defective products. This year, they changed "innovation" to "seeking conformity," mobilized workers to master Soviet operating procedures, and as a result, met the drawing requirements. There are many similar examples.
  Second, emphasizing consistency with Soviet products has no disadvantages, only advantages. It can prompt us to earnestly study Soviet products and data, and consciously improve our technical level. This is the common requirement of employees and the need for national economic development. The cold working workshop has been using outdated operating procedures for a long time, and the product quality has never reached the national standards. This year, the process department helped them formulate radiator process cards based on Soviet data, and the initial inspection and leak test pass rate increased from the initial 60% to 100%. The small transformer workshop revised the operating procedures for production according to Soviet-style instrument transformers and mining transformers, and the finished products were basically
  consistent with Soviet samples. Isn't this kind of consistency what we want?
      Third, achieving "100% consistency with Soviet products" is our glorious responsibility. We must achieve this goal step by step, instead of emphasizing "differences" to slow down our pace. For example, Soviet-style oil tanks are flat and round, while we currently use square ones (this is a traditional style of Westinghouse in the United States). From a technical theory and practical point of view, round ones have more advantages than square ones. The most important thing is that they have stronger mechanical properties, higher heat dissipation efficiency, and are easier to manufacture and mass-produce. When we do not know the superior performance and structure of Soviet products, it is okay for us to use square oil tanks, but we have had Soviet flat and round oil tank samples and manufacturing data since 1953. Soviet transformer structure science also clearly stipulates that transformer structures are flat and round, and special transformers use square ones. Whether in theory or in practice, the problem has been solved. Why are we still clinging to square oil tanks instead of being consistent with Soviet products? Many technicians in the transformer factory demanded to change the oil tank according to the product sample and have been fighting for it for a long time. We believe that the demands put forward by these comrades in this situation are correct and reasonable. We should have a firm belief in striving for complete consistency with Soviet products, strive to create conditions, overcome difficulties, and produce excellent quality products. If the question is reversed, we will relax our thinking and hinder our creative labor.
    "Is it to learn from the Soviet Union entirely, or to learn the main parts?" This is the second question raised by Tang Mingqi in the article. He said: "If we can promote the main parts (maybe not all) of the Soviet experience according to the stage of work development, combined with the actual conditions, and at the same time achieve year-by-year improvement, this approach is realistic and cannot be regarded as a discount on the advanced experience of the Soviet Union." On the surface, this statement is not wrong, but we should compare it with the actual situation of the transformer factory learning from the Soviet Union, then it is not difficult to find the problem. The transformer factory has relatively complete Soviet design data, and the products are Soviet standard specifications. The basic reason why the quality does not meet the standards now is that it has not fully learned and accepted the advanced experience of the Soviet Union. They use Soviet design data, but do not pay attention to learning Soviet process regulations; they use Soviet technical standards, but do not pay attention to learning the structure and parts manufacturing; Soviet-style drawings, but do not learn Soviet methods for technical leadership departments to supervise and use drawings. Facts have proved that doing so will definitely run into snags. Soviet experience is a complete set in both theory and practice. Everything is for the benefit of national production and the convenience of workers' operation, showing a strong sense of the state and mass viewpoint. The key to whether we can fully learn and master the Soviet experience lies in establishing socialist thinking for ourselves. Many technicians in the transformer factory learn from the Soviet Union with an individualistic attitude, which is the fundamental reason why they have not learned well. Some technicians like to sit in the office to improve themselves, but are unwilling to go deep into the site to combine Soviet experience with on-site equipment conditions and workers' actual operations to provide technical guidance to workers. Some are willing to do their own design, but are unwilling to do the process. If people only call things that they personally like as
  "Soviet major experience," then implementing it can only bring losses to national production.
    Soviet experts have put forward many valuable suggestions to the factory from 1951 to now, including technical issues, organizational issues, and working methods and steps, fully reflecting the comprehensiveness and completeness of Soviet construction experience. However, the factory director and chief engineer of the transformer factory did not treat these suggestions with a serious attitude. The factory does not know how many expert suggestions there are to this day, and it is even more unclear whether they have all been implemented. Many technicians in the factory urgently want to know the specific content of the expert suggestions. They have many problems that cannot be solved and want to consult experts, but they are rejected by the chief engineer. The factory director treats experts as everyone describes, "only polite reception," and has never directly consulted experts. In this case, how can we distinguish between the "major" and "minor" experiences of the Soviet Union? Facts have proved that it is precisely those so-called "minor" experiences that have not been paid attention to, and as a result, they have become loopholes that cause quality accidents.
    "To learn from the Soviet Union in essence," Tang Mingqi put forward in the article: "Products designed by ourselves, if the quality can be guaranteed to meet Soviet standards, the basic design data is very close to similar Soviet products, the structure is strong and simple, the parts are universal and standardized to a degree close to Soviet products, key materials are not wasted, and the external dimensions are not larger than similar Soviet products, then the product quality is guaranteed, and the manufacturing cost must also be reasonable, which is to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in essence." If we do not circle around abstract nouns, we can find that the so-called "self-designed" here is only built on the basis of "if", and not on the basis of reality. This reality is Soviet products. The correct attitude should be to learn Soviet design with a creative labor attitude and to keep up with Soviet products. All our design and manufacturing work must be and can only be based on Soviet products as our teacher, otherwise it is just a dead end. The biggest lesson the factory has learned in the past few years is that it has not truly designed and manufactured products that are consistent with Soviet requirements. For example, when designing tap switches, we clearly have Soviet drawings, but we don't learn them. Instead, we came up with a "self-designed" one and changed the adjusting shoulder of the Soviet tap switch from round to square, and as a result, it became a useless dead object. Countless examples have proved that wherever there is such "ingenuity," due to the lack of good learning of Soviet design data, serious problems have occurred to varying degrees.
    One of the fundamental problems that the Shenyang Transformer Factory urgently needs to solve is to correctly learn from the Soviet Union. There has always been controversy within the factory on this issue. The leaders of the Electrical Industry Administration have not been able to fundamentally solve this problem in principle, thus causing their leadership to be somewhat disconnected from the party work and the broad masses of the factory. In dealing with the issue of technical personnel, they often do not improve these comrades politically, but worship authority, shield mistakes, and abandon leadership. This prevents experienced technical workers from exerting their strength on the right path, and at the same time inhibits the growth of new technical forces.
    How to correctly solve the problem of the transformer factory learning from the Soviet Union? Based on our understanding of the factory, we hope that the relevant parties will consider the following suggestions.
    First, the Party Committee should strengthen its political leadership in learning from the Soviet Union. The Party and the administration should earnestly examine the problems in learning from the Soviet Union and draw correct conclusions to educate comrades and improve their work. In the past, some comrades of the Party Committee had raised opinions on issues such as learning from the Soviet Union and quality accidents, but because the Party Committee's work was unsound and some administrative leaders could not accept opinions from the Party's standpoint, a unified action of the entire Party did not form, which is a great lesson. The Party Committee should realize that leading all employees to learn from the Soviet Union, drawing a clear line between socialism and capitalism, and thereby establishing the socialist ideology of leading production is the political responsibility of the Party Committee. All ideas that run counter to this must be criticized, and ideological struggle must be carried out to adhere to correctly learning from the Soviet Union. To this end, it is first necessary to strengthen collective leadership. All principled issues should be brought to the Party Committee for discussion, and consistent understanding should be sought in accordance with Party principles to make corresponding resolutions. We must learn from the lessons and seriously criticize the erroneous idea of attempting to weaken or even abolish the Party's collective leadership under the pretext of the factory director's responsibility system, and emphasize that Communist Party members must obey the Party's collective leadership and give full play to their individual independent and responsible role under the leadership of the Party. Secondly, we should widely publicize the advanced nature of Soviet transformer design and manufacturing in theory and practice among the masses, draw a clear distinction between socialism and capitalism in technical viewpoints, and vigorously publicize the suggestions of Soviet experts, so that technical personnel and technical workers can master Soviet drawings and process data. It is very necessary for the Party Committee of the transformer factory to launch a wave of learning from the Soviet Union based on the inspection, so as to mobilize and rely on the working class to struggle for quickly mastering new technologies and ensuring the production of excellent products.
    Second, discussions should be organized among technical personnel to carefully study and summarize past experiences and lessons. Various product quality accidents have caused losses to the country. The fundamental way to remedy this loss is to learn from the lessons, improve thinking, and improve work, rather than simply pursuing responsibility. The Shenyang Transformer Factory has a fairly strong technical force, including experienced veteran technical workers, returnees from the Soviet Union, and young technical workers who have graduated from school and have initially acquired practical experience. The current problem is to organically combine these technical forces under unified thinking and goals, learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and move forward together. There are basically three problems to be solved among technical personnel today. One is to systematically learn from the Soviet Union from theory to practice, and to correctly use Soviet experience in a realistic manner to improve our ideological and technical level. One is to fully rely on the working class, to closely cooperate with on-site employees, technical workers must cherish the infinite wisdom and creativity of the working class, make full use of workers' practical experience to enrich and improve the technical level, and at the same time provide technical support and operational convenience to workers. One is to strengthen the unity within the technical personnel. The so-called unity is by no means peaceful coexistence as in the past, but to achieve consistency in political and technical viewpoints through democratic discussion. We must oppose mutual contempt, young technical personnel must respect experienced veteran comrades and humbly learn from their experience gained from years of practice, while veteran comrades should care about the growth of young comrades and learn from their vigorous and enterprising spirit.
    Third, necessary measures and systems should be stipulated to arrange the future work of learning from the Soviet Union. The Party and the administration should consider learning from the Soviet Union as a regular task. We should widely solicit opinions from the masses, formulate some necessary and feasible systems, and insist on implementing these systems, especially continuous and unremitting inspections. Only in this way can the results of this inspection work be consolidated and steadily developed forward.

    一个根本的问题
    本报记者　安岗
    沈阳变压器厂一再发生产品质量事故的根本的原因，是没有全面树立社会主义领导生产的思想，放弃了对资本主义思想的斗争。在一部分同志思想中，或多或少地保留着资本主义技术观点。有这种思想的人不是站在马克思列宁主义的立场观点上来认识苏联技术水平的先进性，而总是怀疑苏联，把先进同落后的东西等量齐观，美其名曰搞自己的“创造”，实际上是发展了落后保守的东西。这种思想不受到批判和纠正，工厂就不可能切实完成全面学习苏联、保证生产优良产品的任务。
    一九五四年七月发表在“电器工业”上的沈阳变压器厂主任工程师汤明奇写的一篇文章，就可以说明不少的问题。这篇文章题目叫作“怎样正确地认识和学习苏联的先进产品设计经验”，文章提到的问题是工厂内部长期争论而没有得到正确解决的一些根本看法问题。
      “我们设计的产品能不能与苏联产品有所差异。”这是汤明奇在文章中提出的一个问题，他批判了一种看法：“现在有些同志认为我们的产品必须百分之百与苏联产品相同，零部件不许与苏联产品有任何差异，否则就是对于苏联先进设计经验打了折扣，也就是‘不相信苏联’。”
    可是人们要问，为什么不把问题的提法颠倒过来，说成：“我们设计的产品能不能与苏联产品一致”。这在沈阳变压器工厂来说，是应当而且完全有必要首先回答的问题。因为第一，变压器工厂从一九五二年就已拥有制造变压器的苏联资料，如果工厂厂长和主任工程师不把这些资料的一部分搁在一边，而是真正发动全体职工认真学习，工厂就不可能连续发生事故，就一定能生产同苏联产品相同的产品。一九五三年工厂金工车间零件生产十分低劣，车间干部们曾认为条件不够，达不到图纸规定的公差要求，技术员擅自修改图纸一百张，造成废品和次品，今年他们把“立异”改为“求同”，发动工人掌握苏联操作规程，结果达到图纸要求，类似的例子是很多的。
  第二，强调同苏联产品的一致，没有任何坏处，只有好处。它能促使我们认真学习苏联产品和资料，自觉地提高技术水平，这是职工的共同要求，也是国民经济发展的需要。冷作车间长期使用落后的操作规程，产品质量总达不到国家标准，今年工艺科根据苏联资料帮助他们拟订了散热器工艺卡片，初检试漏合格率由最初百分之六十上升至百分之百。小变压器车间按照苏联型互感器和矿用变压器，修订操作规程进行生产，成品与苏联实样基本
  一致。这样的一致难道不是我们的要求吗？
      第三，达到“百分之百的同苏联产品一致”，这是我们的光荣责任，我们要一步一步地达到这个目标，而不是强调“差异”来放慢自己的脚步。譬如苏式油箱是扁圆型的，我们现采用的是方型的，
  （这是美国西屋公司一种传统的样式）从技术理论和实用观点来看，圆型的比方型的好处多，最主要的是机械性能强，散热效率高，制造方便，便于大量生产。当着我们还不知道苏联产品的性能机构优越性的时候，我们使用方型油箱是可以的，可是我们从一九五三年就有了苏联扁圆型油箱的实样和制造资料，苏联变压器结构学上也明白规定，变压器结构是扁圆形、特殊的变压器采用方形。无论在理论上和实际上，都已解决了问题，为什么还是抱着方型油箱不放而不去和苏联产品保持一致呢？变压器厂很多技术人员，要求按产品实样改变油箱，并且长期地进行斗争，我们认为：这些同志在这样情况下提出的要求是正确的和合理的。我们应当有着争取同苏联产品完全一致的坚定信念，努力创造条件，克服困难，生产质量优良的产品，如果把问题的提法颠倒了，就会在思想上松懈起来，妨碍我们创造性的劳动。
    “是全部学习苏联，还是学习主要部分，”这是汤明奇在文章中提出的第二个问题。他说：“如能根据工作发展的阶段，结合现实条件，推广了苏联经验的主要部分（可能不是全部）同时作到逐年提高，这样作法是实事求是的，不能算是对苏联先进经验打了折扣。”从表面上说，这样的说法并无错误，可是我们要同变压器厂学习苏联的实际情况作
  一比较，就不难发现其中的问题。变压器厂有着比较完备的苏联设计资料，产品是苏联标准规格。现在质量达不到标准的基本原因是由于没有全部学习和接受苏联先进经验。他们用苏联设计资料，但不重视学习苏联工艺规程；用苏联的技术标准，但不注意学习结构及零件的制作用；苏联式图纸，但不去学习苏联关于技术领导部门监督和使用图纸的方法。事实证明，这样作就一定碰钉子。苏联的经验无论在理论上在实践上都是完整的一套，一切都是为了国家生产的利益和工人操作的方便，表现着强烈的国家观念和群众观点。能不能全部学习和掌握苏联经验，关键在于要为自己树立社会主义思想。变压器厂有不少技术人员，用个人主义的态度去学习苏联，这是他们没有学好的根本原因。有的技术员喜欢坐在办公室提高自己，而不愿深入现场把苏联经验同现场设备条件，工人实际操作结合起来向工人进行技术指导，有的愿意自己搞设计，而不愿意搞工艺。如果人们只是把个人喜好的东西，叫做
  “苏联主要经验”，这样实行起来也只能给国家生产带来损失。
    苏联专家从一九五一年到现在向工厂提出很多宝贵建议，其中有技术问题，有组织问题，也有工作方法和步骤，充分体现了苏联建设经验的全面性和完整性。可是，变压器厂厂长和主任工程师却没有用严肃的态度来对待这些建议。工厂到今天搞不清一共有多少专家建议，更不清楚是否全部得到实现。工厂很多技术人员迫切要求知道专家建议的具体内容。他们有很多问题得不到解决要求向专家请教，却被主任工程师拒绝。厂长对待专家，正像大家所形容的是“只有礼貌上的接待”，从来没有向专家直接请教过。在这样情况下，怎样能够区别苏联的“主要”经验和“次要”经验呢。事实证明，正是那些被认为的所谓“次要”经验，没有被重视，结果就成了产生质量事故的漏洞。
    “要在本质上学习苏联，”汤明奇在文章中提出：“自行设计的产品，如能保证质量符合苏联标准，基本设计数据与同类的苏联产品十分接近，结构上作到坚固简单，零件通用性及标准化程度接近苏联产品，关键材料不浪费，外型尺寸不比同类型的苏联产品大，这样，产品质量即取得了保证，制造成本也必然合理，也就是在本质上学习了苏联先进经验”。如果我们不在抽象的名词上打圈子，就可以发现，这里所谓的“自行设计”，只是建筑在“如果”的基础上，而没有建筑在现实基础上，这个现实基础就是苏联产品。正确的态度应该是用创造性的劳动态度，学习苏联设计，并向苏联产品看齐。我们的一切设计和制造的工作，都必须是而且也只能是以苏联产品为师，否则只是绝路一条。工厂几年来最大的教训就是没有真正设计和制造同苏联要求一致的产品。例如设计分接开关，明明有苏联图样但不去学，反而来了一个“自行设计”，把苏联分接开关的调节肖圆肩改成了方肩，结果变成了不起作用的死物。无数例子证明凡是这样“独出心裁”的地方，由于没有很好的学习苏联的设计资料，都在不同程度上发生了严重的问题。
    沈阳变压器厂急需解决的根本问题之一是要正确地学习苏联。在这个问题上，工厂内部一直都有着争论。电器工业管理局的领导者没有能够从原则上彻底地解决这个问题，因而就使他们的领导同工厂党的工作和广大群众有了一定程度的脱节。在对待技术人员问题上，他们常常不是从政治上来提高这些同志，而是崇拜权威，袒护错误，放弃领导。这样就使有经验的技术工作者不能在正确道路上发挥自己的力量，同时也抑制了新的技术力量的成长。
    怎样正确解决变压器厂学习苏联问题呢？根据我们对工厂的了解，希望有关方面考虑以下的一些建议。
    第一，要加强党委会对学习苏联的政治领导。党和行政应认真检查学习苏联中的问题并作出正确的结论来教育同志改进工作。过去党委会有些同志对于学习苏联、质量事故等问题曾提出过意见，但因党委会工作不健全和某些行政领导干部不能站在党的立场上接受意见，结果没有形成全党一致的行动，这是一个极大的教训。党委会应当认识到：领导全体职工学习苏联，划清社会主义与资本主义的界限，从而树立社会主义领导生产的思想，这是党委会的政治责任，一切与此相反的思想都要受到批判，要为坚持正确地学习苏联而进行思想斗争。为此，首先必须加强集体领导，一切原则问题都应拿到党委会上去讨论，并且按照党的原则求得一致的认识，作出相应的决议。要接受教训，严肃批判那种借口厂长负责制而企图减弱以至取消党的集体领导的错误思想，强调共产党员必须服从党的集体领导，在党的领导下充分发挥个人独立负责的作用。其次应当在群众中广泛宣传苏联变压器设计和制造在理论和实践方面的先进性，在技术观点上划清社会主义同资本主义的区别，大张旗鼓宣传苏联专家建议，要使技术人员和技术工人都能掌握苏联图纸和工艺资料。变压器厂党委会很有必要在检查的基础上发动职工掀起学习苏联热潮，这样就能动员和依靠工人阶级为迅速掌握新技术、保证生产优良产品而斗争。
    第二，应当在技术人员中组织讨论，认真研究和总结过去的经验教训。各种产品质量事故曾给国家造成了损失，补救这一损失的根本办法是接受教训，提高思想，改进工作，而不是单纯地去追究责任。沈阳变压器厂技术力量是相当雄厚的，其中有有丰富经验的老技术工作者，有留苏的实习生，有从学校毕业出来并已初步具备实际经验的青年技术工作者。现在的问题是要在统一的思想和目标下把这几种技术力量有机地结合在一起，取长补短，共同前进。技术人员中今天要解决的问题基本上是三个，一个是从理论到实际系统学习苏联，并以实事求是的态度正确地运用苏联经验来提高我们的思想水平和技术水平。一个是充分依靠工人阶级，密切同现场职工的合作，技术工作者要珍重工人阶级的无限智慧和创造性，要充分利用工人实践经验来丰富和提高技术水平，同时要从技术上给工人以支援和操作上的方便。一个是加强技术人员内部的团结。所谓团结，绝不是像过去那样的和平共居，而是要经民主讨论来达到政治观点和技术观点上的一致，要反对互相轻视，年轻的技术人员要尊重有经验的老同志，虚心地学习他们从多年实践中得来的经验，老同志则应关心年轻同志的成长，学习他们蓬勃进取的精神。
    第三，要规定必要的措施和制度来安排今后学习苏联的工作。党和行政要考虑把学习苏联作为一个经常的工作。应该广泛征求群众意见，订出一些必要的和切实可行的制度，坚持执行这些制度，其中特别是要进行经常不断的检查。只有这样，才能把这次检查工作的成果巩固下来，并稳步地向前发展。
