Dear comrades and friends, esteemed members of the delegation of the People's Republic of China, esteemed Comrade Peng Dehuai!

Please allow me to extend to you—the envoys of our great China who have come to express their regards to us on the occasion of the 37th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army and Navy—our heartfelt congratulations and sincere gratitude!

Please allow me, at this grand gathering, to extend the warmest and most cordial greetings to the great Chinese people and the government of the People's Republic of China.

Your visit to express regards to the Soviet army, your concern and respect for the Soviet people, fill us with even greater confidence in the power and consolidation of Sino-Soviet friendship.

The great friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China is our most precious victory; with it, no enemy is frightening to us.

This friendship has become an unprecedented and immensely powerful force in the cause of defending and consolidating peace.

At a time when the imperialists are exacerbating the international situation, especially the situation in the Far East, the common struggle of the Soviet and Chinese peoples for peace and security is of paramount importance.

We are very pleased to see the Chinese working people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, displaying miracles of labor upsurge in transforming the face of their motherland and victoriously building and consolidating a new state of people's democracy.

The understanding of the heroic commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army by the servicemen of the Soviet Army and Navy is deepening day by day.

The glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army is a reliable guarantee of national independence in the struggle against the imperialist conspiracy of aggression.

Please allow me, on behalf of all Soviet servicemen, to extend a fraternal combat salute to the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army, tempered in battle!

Dear comrades!

During these years we have spent in China, the infinite respect and affectionate friendship for the talented and hard-working Chinese people have become even more consolidated in our hearts and minds!

Soviet servicemen will bring the glory of our best friends—the great Chinese people—to every corner of our vast Soviet motherland!

May the great, unbreakable, fraternal friendship between the people of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China be increasingly consolidated and developed for generations to come!

Long live the great Chinese people!

Long live the wise Chinese Communist Party!

Glory to the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army!

Please allow me to propose a toast to the health of all members of the delegation of the People's Republic of China, headed by Comrade Peng Dehuai!
