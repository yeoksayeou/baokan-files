To establish and consolidate China's independent, unified, and stable monetary system has been the consistent goal of the Chinese people's efforts in monetary work. The establishment of the People's Bank of China on December 1, 1948, and the issuance of the Renminbi was an important step in establishing our country's independent, unified, and stable monetary system. The unification of financial and economic work in March 1950, striving for currency stability and curbing price increases, laid the foundation for our country's independent, unified, and stable monetary system. The current issuance of the new Renminbi marks the further improvement and consolidation of our country's independent, unified, and stable monetary system.

The monetary system is determined by the economic and political system of society, and it fully reflects the characteristics of the economic and political system of society. The old Chinese monetary system reflected the semi-colonial and semi-feudal nature of old China and became a tool for cruelly exploiting and plundering the people. The new Chinese monetary system reflects the characteristics of our people's democratic economic and political system, reflects China's political and economic independence, unity, and consolidation, and becomes a tool for seeking the welfare of the people.

Our country's monetary system's first characteristic is its independence, which is fundamentally different from the old Chinese monetary system's dependence on and subordination to foreign imperialism.

Since the Opium War, the old Chinese monetary system gradually lost its independent nature and became a vassal of foreign imperialist monetary blocs as China's economy became colonized.

On the one hand, it is manifested in the gradual decline of the old Chinese monetary system into a vassal of foreign imperialist monetary blocs. China originally used the tael system, with taels as the unit of account and silver ingots and copper coins in circulation. But then foreign-minted silver dollars flowed in, including the American Eagle Dollar, the British Trade Dollar (or "Staff Dollar"), the Japanese Dragon Dollar, and the Mexican Eagle Dollar, which widely circulated in port cities and prompted China to adopt the silver dollar as its standard currency in 1933. From then on, foreign imperialism controlled changes in China's currency value by manipulating international gold and silver ratios. This intensified the plunder of our country's wealth. In August 1934, the United States announced a silver nationalization order, raising silver prices and purchasing silver. Chinese silver began to flow out in large quantities. From July to October 1934, 256 million silver dollars flowed out, causing a reduction in Chinese silver dollar reserves and deflation. Later, the Kuomintang reactionary ruling clique, in order to support its reactionary rule, wage anti-people wars, and exploit the people, abandoned the silver standard monetary system in November 1935 and adopted the gold exchange standard monetary system. The silver accumulated by the Chinese people over thousands of years was exported to Britain in exchange for pounds sterling as reserves for the fake legal tender. Subsequently, in order to compete for control of China's monetary system, the United States used the method of ceasing to purchase silver and, under the Kuomintang reactionary ruling clique's policy of national betrayal, signed the Sino-American Silver Agreement, further transporting Chinese silver to the United States in exchange for US dollars as reserves for the fake legal tender. From then on, the old Chinese monetary system became a vassal of American imperialism.

On the other hand, it is manifested in the widespread circulation of banknotes issued by foreign imperialist banks, seriously infringing upon China's sovereignty. According to reports from foreign banks in China in 1932, banks from imperialist countries issued the equivalent of more than 560.6 million silver dollars in banknotes in China, including 7.4 million issued by Citibank, 151.1 million issued by HSBC, 193.3 million issued by Banque de l'Indochine, and 125 million issued by the Bank of Korea, controlled by Japanese Zaibatsu. After the start of the War of Resistance Against Japan, US dollars and Hong Kong dollars further penetrated the Chinese market on a large scale, becoming one of the main tools for pricing and circulation in the market. This circulation of foreign currency infringed upon our country's sovereignty, and allowed imperialist countries to plunder the wealth of the Chinese people with a piece of paper, using it as capital to invest in China and exploit the Chinese working people, and also subjected the Chinese people to the plunder of their currency depreciation.

The result of the old Chinese monetary system becoming a vassal of imperialism was that imperialist countries enjoyed full convenience in obtaining raw materials, selling finished products, investing in factories, and extracting profits in China; and that imperialist countries were able to shift their losses to China during economic crises or wartime inflation, thereby strengthening their domination and exploitation of the Chinese people.

The new Chinese monetary system is fundamentally different from the old Chinese monetary system. Since its issuance in 1929, the Chinese people's currency has consistently adhered to its independent nature, and has grown and consolidated in the process of repeated monetary struggles with foreign imperialism and its vassal – the Chinese bureaucratic capitalist regime's issued currency. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Party pointed out the task of "fighting against the enemy's economic blockade, destruction, and the issuance of counterfeit currency." At that time, Japanese imperialism not only exploited the Chinese people with the banknotes issued by the puppet China United Reserve Bank and the puppet Central Reserve Bank, but also used fake legal tender to extract people's materials. In order to oppose Japanese imperialism's economic and monetary plunder, the local governments in the liberated areas issued their own people's currency and strictly prohibited the circulation of enemy and puppet currency and fake legal tender. This measure played an important role in ensuring the development of production in the liberated areas and supporting the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan.

Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, we have adhered to the independent nature of the monetary system. We quickly eliminated the fake Gold Yuan notes and fake Silver Yuan notes, and at the same time, we quickly eliminated the fake currencies of imperialist countries circulating domestically. The situation in which the old Chinese currency relied on the US dollar as a reserve to fix mutual currency values ​​has been fundamentally changed. In response to the actual depreciation of the US dollar and the 30.5% depreciation of the pound sterling, we repeatedly lowered the exchange rates of capitalist countries, protecting our country's prices from the impact of wartime inflation and economic crises in capitalist countries. Because our country has control over foreign trade and has strengthened trade, customs, and foreign exchange management, China's economy has been freed from the influence of the capitalist world market. Foreign exchange management and foreign exchange rates have become an important tool for consolidating our country's monetary system and fighting against the monetary plunder of imperialist countries.

Our country's monetary system's second characteristic is its unity, which is fundamentally different from the old Chinese monetary system's decentralized, chaotic, and ununified phenomena.

For a long time, the old Chinese monetary system was not unified. Under the tael system, due to the inconsistent weight of various scales, divided into Treasury Scale, Customs Scale, Grain Scale, Market Scale, etc., the unit of account was the Gui Yuan, but the main currencies used were silver dollars, silver dimes, and copper coins. This chaotic situation made domestic material exchange very inconvenient. The circulation of paper money also presented the same chaotic situation. Initially, local warlords relied on the support of foreign imperialism to issue banknotes from local banks, including Zhang Zuolin's official notes from the Northeast Official Bank, Yan Xishan's banknotes from the Shanxi Provincial Bank, and Zhang Zongchang's banknotes from the Shandong Provincial Bank. Sichuan and Yunnan also issued local currencies. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang reactionary government's officials at all levels and the military at all levels competed to issue currencies. For example, more than 50 kinds of local circulating notes appeared in Shandong alone. After the surrender of Japanese imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionary government deliberately maintained special monetary systems in Northeast China and Taiwan. Due to the collapse of the fake legal tender, the old Chinese monetary system presented an unprecedented chaotic phenomenon. In addition to the fake legal tender, gold, silver dollars, and foreign currencies became tools for pricing and circulation in urban and rural areas.

The reason why the old Chinese monetary system could not be unified for a long time is inseparable from the long-term domination of old China by foreign imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism. It was precisely because foreign imperialism supported local separatism of feudal forces, and because of the infighting within Chinese bureaucratic capitalism, the selling out of sovereignty, and political and economic crises, that China's monetary system could not be unified. This lack of unity and chaos in the monetary system seriously hindered China's political and economic unification, hindered the development of China's unified national economy, hindered the development of China's industrial and agricultural production and the exchange of materials throughout the country, and caused disasters for the people.

The new Chinese monetary system has consistently followed the principle of unity. After establishing local governments in various places, the Chinese people strived to unify the issuance of currency within their regions. And as the People's Liberation War gradually won victories, the liberated areas gradually formed a single entity, gradually unifying the currency issuance in various regions. For example, on the basis of the development of the Huazhong Liberation War, a unified Huazhong Bank was established to issue a unified currency, and successively recovered the currencies issued by Dajiang Bank, Jiangnan Bank, Huainan Bank, Huaibei Local Bank, Jianghuai Bank, and Yanfu Bank. On December 1, 1948, with the People's Liberation War about to achieve a nationwide victory, the People's Bank of China was established to issue a unified Renminbi nationwide, and successively recovered the local currencies issued by Jinchaji Border Region Bank, Jinan Bank, Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Bank, Jinxi North Farmers Bank, Shandong Bohai Bank, Huazhong Bank, and Zhongzhou Farmers Bank. In 1951, it successively recovered the Northeast Bank notes and Xinjiang local circulating notes, completing the basic unification of the national currency.

The unity of the new Chinese monetary system is also manifested in eliminating the chaotic phenomena in the monetary system, making the Renminbi the only legal currency circulating throughout the country. After the establishment of people's regimes in various places, the Chinese people, while issuing their own currency, strictly prohibited the circulation of gold and silver and other disguised currencies. After the liberation of major cities, strict laws and regulations on the management of gold and silver were promulgated, prohibiting the pricing and circulation of gold and silver in the market. Because these laws and regulations were unanimously supported by workers, staff, students, and people from all walks of life, the gold and silver speculation that had formed during the Kuomintang reactionary rule was prohibited.

The unity of the monetary system is a prerequisite for establishing a unified national economy. The non-unification of the currency will cause difficulties in the nationwide exchange of materials, become an obstacle to the development of industrial and agricultural production, and make the planned leadership of the nationwide national economy impossible. Only under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party can the Chinese people complete the unification of the monetary system, which is unprecedented in history. The unification of the currency makes the national market one, and the exchange of materials throughout the country is unimpeded, creating a large-scale exchange of materials from the east, west, north, and south, and enabling the full development of the production of grain, cash crops, native products, special products, livestock products, and industrial products in various places.

The unity of the monetary system is inseparable from the centralized and unified issuance of currency. The management of currency issuance in our country is centralized and unified, which ensures that the national currency circulation closely adapts to commodity circulation and guarantees the stability of the national currency value.

Our country's monetary system's third characteristic is its stability, which is in sharp contrast to the old Chinese monetary system's long-term inability to be stable, and long-term use of paper currency depreciation to exploit the people.

The old Chinese monetary system was unstable. During the silver standard period, due to the general trend of gold being expensive and silver being cheap, and the frequent changes in the gold-silver ratio, the currency value was essentially unstable. On the other hand, the exchange rate between silver taels and silver dollars was also constantly changing. For example, during the agricultural product marketing season, the exchange rate of silver dollars increased, and the silver dollars converted into silver taels, the lowest was seven qian one fen nine, and the highest was seven qian five. The exchange rates often changed due to different silver taels in different places. This instability of the monetary system was extremely unfavorable to the development of national industrial and agricultural production, and was used by the reactionary ruling clique for the cruel exploitation of the people.

The most concentrated manifestation of the instability of the old Chinese currency was the Kuomintang reactionary ruling clique's paper currency inflation and so-called "currency reform." The Kuomintang reactionary ruling clique implemented the so-called legal tender system in 1935, monopolized the issuance of old Chinese currency, plundered the silver and silver dollars accumulated by China for thousands of years, and then implemented unprecedented inflation. In August 1948, it implemented the so-called currency reform, essentially abolishing the fake legal tender, issuing fake Gold Yuan notes, and plundering more than 200 million US dollars in gold, silver, and foreign exchange. The fake Gold Yuan notes began the most severe inflation a month later. On the eve of the Kuomintang reactionary rule's near-total collapse, it issued Silver Yuan notes for a final round of plunder. The Chiang Kai-shek gang is still continuing to use the Taiwan dollar in Taiwan as a tool to implement inflation and plunder the people. The Kuomintang reactionary government's currency issuance increased by 176.8 billion times during the inflation process from June 1937 to May 1949, while Shanghai's prices rose by 138,842 billion times. The Kuomintang reactionary ruling clique plundered the people's wealth from currency depreciation estimated at more than 15 billion silver dollars.

The monetary system of capitalist countries is controlled by the power of monopoly capitalists and used as a tool to seek maximum profits for monopoly capitalists. Because monopoly capitalists attempt to shift the losses in economic crises and pursue the maximum profits brought by war and military expansion, they will inevitably move towards war and inflation. Therefore, the instability of their monetary system is an inevitable result. This monetary crisis is a manifestation of the overall crisis of capitalism, indicating that the dying capitalist world can no longer establish a relatively stable monetary system. The old Chinese monetary system belongs to one of the types of capitalist country monetary systems. It was controlled by foreign imperialism and the regime of our country's bureaucratic capitalism and feudalism, and used as a tool for waging anti-people wars and carrying out the most direct and naked plunder of the people. At the same time, the crisis of the old Chinese monetary system, especially the Kuomintang reactionary government's fake legal tender and fake Gold Yuan notes, also reflects its political crisis and its inevitable trend towards death.

The new Chinese monetary system is stable. That is, during the Second Domestic Revolutionary War, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the People's Revolutionary War, we also worked hard to seek relative stability in the monetary system. Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us: "The state bank's issuance of banknotes should be based primarily on the needs of national economic development. The needs of pure finance can only be placed in a secondary position." ("Our Economic Policy") Because we adopted the policy of developing production and ensuring supply, and military and government personnel practiced strict economy, our currency issuance, in addition to supporting the war, has been used to a great extent for economic investment or loans to support agricultural production, develop handicraft production, and develop state-owned trade. A close connection has been established between currency issuance and commodity production and circulation. Therefore, the exchange rate of the Renminbi against the fake legal tender is increasing day by day. When Shanghai recovered the fake Gold Yuan notes in May 1949, one yuan of Renminbi was equivalent to 100,000 yuan of fake Gold Yuan notes, which is equivalent to more than 300 billion yuan of fake legal tender. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party and the government quickly took measures in March 1950 to unify financial and economic work, striving for a balance of financial revenue and expenditure, material allocation, and cash revenue and expenditure, and striving for the stability of the monetary system. The Renminbi has been proven to be one of the most stable currencies in the world after five years of testing, including the testing of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea. Now our issuance of the new Renminbi and the recovery of the current Renminbi mark the further improvement and consolidation of the monetary system, and are an important measure to thoroughly eliminate the impact of inflation before liberation after the stability of the Renminbi has been fully guaranteed.

The stability of the new Chinese monetary system is determined by the new Chinese people's democratic political system and economic system. Our country's monetary system is controlled by the people's regime and used as a tool to seek welfare for the people. Because we want to continuously develop social production to meet the needs of the people, we require first to establish a stable monetary system to promote the development of national industrial and agricultural production and the exchange of materials, and to create favorable conditions for the stability and improvement of people's lives. The stability of the currency depends on the guarantee of commodities and the guarantee of gold. Because our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation have continuously achieved new victories, and because the national economy is developing increasingly under the leadership of socialist economic components, it is guaranteed that more and more commodities will be put on the market. Because of the increasing proportion of the socialist economy in industrial and agricultural production and the increasing proportion of state-owned commerce, it is guaranteed that these large quantities of commodities will be controlled by the state and put on the market at stable prices. Therefore, our country's monetary system will obtain an increasingly substantial commodity guarantee. Due to the development of our country's production, export trade has achieved greater development, and the balance of international payments has been guaranteed. The increase in gold production and purchase has made the currency's gold guarantee increasingly substantial. At present, the amount of currency in circulation in our country has begun to use cash disbursement plans for planned regulation on the basis of the cash management system to ensure close compliance with the needs of commodity circulation. The increasing consolidation of our country's monetary system is precisely a manifestation of the superiority of the people's democratic political system and economic system.

The above three characteristics of our country's monetary system are closely related to each other. The old Chinese monetary system, because it was dependent on foreign imperialism, determined that it could not achieve monetary unity and stability; and the non-unity of currency circulation further fueled its instability; because of its instability, it further fueled the circulation of foreign currency, losing national sovereignty. The new Chinese monetary system, because it is independent and has fought against the currency of foreign imperialism and its agents – Chinese bureaucratic capitalism and feudalism, has laid the preconditions for monetary unity and stability; because it is a unified standard currency and excludes the circulation of gold, silver, and other disguised currencies, it prevents imperialist countries from manipulating China's monetary system and undermining the stability of the currency value; because it is a stable currency, it further improves the status of the Renminbi and fundamentally excludes the possibility of foreign currency and gold and silver circulation. Therefore, we will continue to fight to uphold the independent, unified, and stable nature of our country's monetary system.

Since the issuance of the new Renminbi marks the further improvement and consolidation of our country's monetary system, it is also conducive to our continuing to fight to consolidate the independent, unified, and stable nature of our country's monetary system, making it a powerful weapon for developing our country's socialist construction and socialist transformation and further improving the people's living standards.

    我国的货币制度是独立、统一和稳定的货币制度
    杨培新
    为建立和巩固我国的独立的统一的稳定的货币制度而斗争，是中国人民在货币工作上一贯努力的目标。一九四八年十二月一日中国人民银行成立，发行人民币，是建立我国独立的统一的稳定的货币制度的重要步骤。一九五○年三月统一财政经济工作，争取通货稳定、制止物价上涨，奠定了我国的独立的统一的稳定的货币制度的基础。现在新的人民币的发行，则标志着我国的独立的统一的稳定的货币制度的进一步健全和巩固。
    货币制度是为社会的经济制度和政治制度所决定的，它充分反映了社会的经济制度和政治制度的特点。旧中国的货币制度反映了旧中国的半殖民地半封建的性质，并成为对于人民进行残酷剥削和掠夺的工具。新中国的货币制度则反映了我国人民民主的经济制度和政治制度的特点，反映了我国政治经济上的独立、统一和巩固，并成为为人民谋取福利的工具。一
    我国货币制度的第一个特点是它的独立性，与旧中国货币制度的依赖于、附属于外国帝国主义的性质根本不同。
    旧中国的货币制度，自鸦片战争以来，随着中国经济的殖民地化，而逐渐丧失了独立的性质，沦为外国帝国主义货币集团的附庸。
    一方面表现为旧中国货币制度的逐步沦为外国帝国主义货币集团的附庸。中国原来通行的是银两制度，记账用银两，流通用银锭和铜元。但跟着就流入了外国铸造的银元，包括美国的美洋，英国的人洋（或杖洋），日本的龙洋，墨西哥的鹰洋，广泛流通于口岸城市，并促使中国于一九三三年改以银元为本位币。外国帝国主义从此就通过操纵国际上金银比价的变化，随时支配着中国币值的变化。并加剧了对我国财富的掠夺，美国一九三四年八月宣布了白银国有命令，提高银价，收购白银，中国白银开始大量外流，自一九三四年七月至十月为止，流出了二亿五千六百万银元，引起了中国银元的筹码减少，通货紧缩的现象。之后，国民党反动统治集团为了支持它的反动统治，进行反人民的战争和搜括人民，于一九三五年十一月废弃了银本位的货币制度，而采用了金汇兑本位货币制度。中国人民数千年来积存的白银又被输出到英国换为英镑，作为伪法币的准备金。其后，美国为争夺对中国货币制度的统治，运用停止搜买白银的方法，在国民党反动统治集团卖国政策下，和美国签订了中美白银协定，再把中国白银运往美国，换为美元，作为伪法币的准备金。自此之后，旧中国的货币制度就成为美帝国主义的附庸。
    另一方面表现为外国帝国主义银行所发行的钞票广泛流通，使中国的主权受到严重的侵犯。据一九三二年在中国的各外商银行的报告，帝国主义国家的银行在中国发行了折合银元五亿六百余万元的纸币，其中包括花旗银行发行七百四十万元，汇丰银行发行一亿五千一百万元，东方汇理银行发行
  一亿九千三百万元，日本财阀控制下的朝鲜银行发行一亿二千五百万元。抗日战争开始以后，美钞和港币更广泛侵入中国市场，成为市场计价行使的主要工具之一。这种外钞流行，侵犯了我国的主权，并使帝国主义国家凭一纸钞票掠夺了中国人民的财富，作为在中国投资、剥削中国劳动人民的资本，而且使中国人民受到它们的通货贬值的掠夺。
    旧中国货币制度成为帝国主义的附庸的结果就使帝国主义国家在中国取给原料、推销成品、投资设厂、榨取利润方面都享受了充分的便利；并使帝国主义国家在经济危机或战争通货膨胀过程中，能够将损失转嫁到中国，并从而加强对中国人民的宰割与剥削。
    新中国的货币制度与旧中国的货币制度根本不同，中国人民的货币自一九二九年发行以来，一贯坚持独立的性质，并在与外国帝国主义及其附庸——中国官僚资本主义政权所发行的货币进行反复的货币斗争过程中，成长和巩固起来。抗日战争时期，党就指出“与敌人经济封锁、破坏、及其伪币发行作斗争”的任务。当时日本帝国主义不仅以其所发行的伪中国联合准备银行和伪中央储备银行的钞票对中国人民进行剥削，而且以伪法币套取人民的物资。为了反对日本帝国主义的经济和货币掠夺，解放区各地方政权发行了人民自己的货币，同时严禁敌伪货币和伪法币的流通。这一措施，在保证发展解放区的生产，支持抗日战争的胜利方面，起了重要的作用。
    中华人民共和国建国以来，我们坚持了货币制度的独立的性质。我们迅速肃清了伪金圆券、伪银元券，同时迅速的把国内流通的帝国主义国家伪货币排除出去。旧中国的货币依靠美元作为准备的把相互币值固定起来的情况已经根本改变，我们针对着美元实际上贬值，和英镑贬值百分之三十点五的情势，一连改低了资本主义国家的外汇牌价，保护了我国的物价不受资本主义国家战争通货膨胀和经济危机的影响。由于我们国家掌握了对外贸易，并加强了贸易、海关和外汇管理，我国经济已经摆脱了资本主义世界市场的影响。外汇管理、外汇汇率已经成为巩固我国货币制度，并与帝国主义国家货币掠夺作斗争的一种重要工具。二
    我国货币制度的第二个特点是它的统一性，与旧中国的货币制度的分散的、混乱的、不统一的现象，有根本的区别。
    旧中国的货币制度长时期以来是不统一的。在银两制度的情况下，由于各种秤的分量不一致，分为库平、关平、漕平、市平等，记账单位是规元等，行使的却主要是银元、银角、铜元。这种混乱状况，使国内物资交流很不便利。纸币的流通，也呈现同样的混乱情况，最初，各地方军阀依靠外国帝国主义的支持发行地方银行的钞票，其中包括张作霖的东北官银号的官帖，阎锡山的山西省银行钞票，张宗昌的山东省银行钞票，四川、云南也发行了地方货币。抗日战争期间，国民党反动政府的各级官吏和各级军队，更争相发行货币，如山东一地就出现了五十种以上的地方流通券。日本帝国主义投降以后，国民党反动政府又在东北、台湾有意地保持特殊的币制。由于伪法币的崩溃，旧中国货币制度呈现了空前的混乱现象，除了伪法币外，黄金和银元以及外钞，均成为城乡计价和行使的工具。
    旧中国的货币制度长时期不能统一，与旧中国一贯受外国帝国主义、官僚资本主义和封建主义的主宰是不可分的。正是由于外国帝国主义支持封建势力的地方割据，正是由于中国官僚资本主义内部的勾心斗角，出卖主权和政治经济上的危机，使中国货币制度不能统一。这种货币制度上的不统一和混乱现象，严重地妨碍了中国政治上经济上的统一，妨碍了中国统一的国民经济的发展，妨碍了中国工业农业生产的发展和全国的物资交流，并造成了对于人民的灾害。
    新中国的货币制度，一贯遵循着统一的原则。中国人民在建立了各地地方政权之后，力求在本地区内统一货币的发行。并随着人民解放战争的逐步胜利，解放区逐步联成一片，而逐步统一各个地区的货币发行。例如在华中解放战争开展的基础上，成立了统一的华中银行，发行统一的货币，先后收回大江银行、江南银行、淮南银行、淮北地方银行、江淮银行、盐阜银行所发行的货币。一九四八年十二月一日，在解放战争即将获得全国性的胜利的情况下，成立了中国人民银行，发行全国统一的人民币，先后收回晋察冀边区银行、冀南银行、陕甘宁边区银行、晋西北农民银行、山东北海银行、华中银行、中州农民银行等所发行的地方货币。一九五一年并又先后收回东北银行券、和新疆地方流通券，完成全国货币的基本统一。
    新中国的货币制度的统一，还表现为肃清了货币制度上的混乱的现象，使人民币成为流通全国的唯一的法定的货币。中国人民在各地方政权建立以后，于发行人民自己的货币同时，就严厉禁止金银流通，和其它变相货币的行使。在各大城市解放以后，又颁布了严格管理金银的法令，禁止金银的计价行使，流通市场，由于这一法令得到工人、职员、学生和各阶层人民的一致支持，国民党反动统治时期所形成的金银投机现象已被禁止。
    货币制度的统一，是建立统一的国民经济的前提。货币的不统一，将造成全国性物资交流的困难，成为工农业生产发展的障碍，并使全国性的国民经济的计划领导成为不可能。只有在中国共产党领导之下，中国人民才能完成历史上前所未有的货币制度的统一。货币的统一，使全国市场联为一体，全国物资交流畅流无阻，造成物资的东西南北大交流，并使各地的粮食、经济作物、土产品、特产品、畜产品、工业品生产得到充分的发展。
    货币制度的统一与货币发行的集中统一，是密切不可分的。我国的货币发行的管理是集中的统一的，这保证了全国货币流通的密切适应于商品流通，保证了全国币值的稳定。三
    我国货币制度的第三个特点是它的稳定性，与旧中国货币制度的长时期不能稳定，长时期运用纸币贬值剥削人民，恰恰成为尖锐的对比。
    旧中国的货币制度是不稳定的。在银本位时期，由于金贵银贱的总趋势和金银比价的经常变化，因此币值实质上是不稳定的。另一方面银两与银元之间的比价，也是经常变化的，如农产品上市季节，银元的比价提高，银元折合银两，最低为七钱一分九，最高为七钱五。各地银两不同，比价也常常变化。这种货币制度的不稳定性，对于全国工农业生产的发展是极端不利的，并且被反动统治集团利用来对人民的残酷的剥削。
    旧中国货币的不稳定性的最集中的表现，为国民党反动统治集团的纸币通货膨胀和所谓“货币改革”。国民党反动统治集团于一九三五年实行所谓法币制度，垄断了旧中国的货币发行，掠夺了中国数千年来所积存的白银和银元，然后实行了前所未有的通货膨胀。一九四八年八月又实行所谓货币改革，实质上废弃了伪法币，发行伪金圆券，掠夺了二亿美元以上的黄金、白银和外汇，伪金圆券于一个月后开始了最剧烈的通货膨胀。在国民党反动统治濒临全面崩溃的前夕，又以发行银元券，作最后一次掠夺。蒋介石匪帮现在在台湾仍然继续运用台币，作为实施通货膨胀掠夺人民的工具。国民党反动政府自一九三七年六月至一九四九年五月通货膨胀过程中使货币发行增加了一，七六八亿倍，同时上海的物价上涨一三八，八四二亿倍，国民党反动统治集团从通货贬值中掠夺了人民的财富估计在一百五十亿银元以上。
    资本主义国家的货币制度，是由垄断资本家的政权所掌握，用来为垄断资本家谋取最大利润的工具。由于垄断资本家企图转嫁经济危机中的损失，追逐战争和扩张军备所带来的最大利润，他们必然走向战争和通货膨胀，因此其货币制度的不稳定性是必然的结果。这种货币危机正是资本主义总危机的一种表现，说明垂死的资本主义世界已经不可能建立一种比较稳定的货币制度。旧中国的货币制度属于资本主义国家货币制度的类型之一，它是被外国帝国主义和我国官僚资本主义、封建主义的政权所掌握，用作进行反人民战争的工具，向人民进行最直接的赤裸裸的掠夺。同时旧中国货币制度，尤其是国民党反动政府的伪法币和伪金圆券的危机，也正反映了它的政治的危机，和它的必然趋向于死亡。
    新中国的货币制度是稳定的。即在第二次国内革命战争时期、抗日战争时期和人民革命战争时期，我们也曾努力求取货币制度的相对的稳定。毛泽东同志指示我们：“国家银行发行纸币，基本上应该根据国民经济发展的需要。单纯财政的需要只能放在次要的地位。”（“我们的经济政策”）由于我们采取发展生产、保障供给的方针，军政人员的厉行节约，我们的货币发行除了支援战争以外，已以很大力量来从事经济投资或贷款，以扶持农业生产，发展手工业生产，发展国营贸易。货币的发行与商品的生产和流通，已经建立了密切的联系。因此，人民币对伪法币的比值是日益提高的，到一九四九年五月上海收兑伪金圆券时，人民币一元折合伪金圆券十万元，也就是折合伪法币三千亿元之多。中华人民共和国成立以后，党和政府迅即于一九五○年三月采取了统一财政经济工作，争取财政收支、物资调拨、现金收支平衡的措施，争取了货币制度的稳定。人民币经过五年来的考验，包括抗美援朝战争的考验，已经被证明为世界上最稳定的货币之一。现在我们发行新的人民币，收回现行的人民币，则又标示着货币制度的进一步健全和巩固，是人民币稳定已经具有更加充分的保证以后，彻底扫除解放以前通货膨胀影响的重要措施。
    新中国货币制度的稳定性，是为新中国的人民民主的政治制度和经济制度所决定的。我国的货币制度，是由人民的政权所掌握，用来为人民谋取福利的工具。由于我们要不断发展社会生产，以满足人民的需要，因此我们要求首先建立稳定的货币制度，以促进全国工业农业生产和物资交流的发展，以为人民生活的稳定和提高造成有利的条件。货币的稳定，依靠于商品的保证和黄金的保证。由于我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业不断取得新的胜利，由于国民经济在社会主义经济成分领导下的日益发展，保证将有更加大量的商品投入市场。由于社会主义经济在工农业生产中所占比重的增加，国营商业中所占比重的增加，保证了这些大量的商品将掌握在国家手中，按稳定的价格投入市场。因此，我国的货币制度将获得日益充实的商品保证。由于我国生产的发展，出口贸易已经获得更大的发展，国际收支的平衡已经获得保障。黄金生产及收兑的增加，又使货币的黄金保证日益充实。目前我国的货币流通量，在现金管理制度的基础上已经开始运用现金出纳计划进行有计划的调节，以保证密切符合于商品流通的需要。我国货币制度的日益巩固，正是人民民主的政治制度和经济制度的优越性的表现。
    我国的货币制度的上述三种性质，是互相密切联系的。旧中国的货币制度，由于其依附于外国帝国主义，便决定了它不可能实现货币的统一和稳定；而货币流通上的不统一，更助长了它的不稳定性；由于它的不稳定性而进一步助长外币流通，丧失了国家的主权。新中国的货币制度，由于它是独立的，并对外国帝国主义及其代理人——中国官僚资本主义、封建主义的货币进行了斗争，因此为货币的统一和稳定奠定了前提条件；由于它是统一的本位币，排斥了金银及其它变相货币的行使，使帝国主义国家无从操纵中国的币制，破坏币值的稳定；由于它是稳定的货币，更进一步提高了人民币的地位，根本排斥了外钞和金银流通的可能。因此，我们将不断地为坚持我国货币制度的独立的、统一的、稳定的性质而斗争。
    新的人民币的发行，既然标志着我国的货币制度的进一步的健全和巩固，因此也就有利于我们继续为巩固我国货币制度的独立的统一的稳定的性质而斗争，使之成为发展我国社会主义建设和社会主义改造事业、进一步提高人民的生活水准的有力武器。
