    Strengthen National Unity, Oppose Atomic War
                      Sangjiyexi, Chairman of the People's Government of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province
    The 500,000 people of Tibetan, Yi, Hui, and Han ethnicities in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province, like the people of the whole country and peace-loving people around the world, resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialists' use of atomic weapons and all war provocations in our Taiwan. We are very clear that the Soviet Union has consistently conducted research on the peaceful uses of atomic energy for the cause of human prosperity and progress. The United States, on the contrary, is frantically clamoring for and preparing for atomic war in order to achieve its goal of seizing foreign territories. The Chinese people, who have rich experience and a glorious tradition of opposing imperialism, are not afraid of any war threats. If U.S. imperialism wants to impose war on our people, we have the power to defeat it. This has been proven in the War of Liberation and on the Korean battlefield.
    Since liberation, the people of all ethnic groups in our Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province have enjoyed the right to ethnic equality in the big family of the motherland, and have been freed from the oppression of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. The great care and help from Chairman Mao, the Chinese Communist Party, and the people of the motherland over the past few years have enabled the autonomous region's economy and culture to develop, the people's living standards to gradually improve, and national unity to become increasingly consolidated. These situations have never existed in history. The bright and far-reaching prospects for ethnic minorities and the prosperous and happy socialist society are inspiring the people of all ethnic groups in our autonomous region to engage in heroic peaceful labor. The people of our autonomous region have fresh memories of the bloody rule and oppression of imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and will never tolerate their sinister schemes to succeed. The people of our autonomous region will support the liberation of Taiwan and oppose the use of atomic weapons with the following actions: First, further enhance national unity and continue to deeply implement our region's patriotic unity pact and unity and security resolution. Second, do a good job in agricultural and animal husbandry production in 1955, continue to implement our region's agricultural and animal husbandry production policies, increase the production of agricultural products and local specialties, and reduce livestock disease and death. Third, we will always be vigilant to prevent and expose enemy agents' rumors and sabotage activities, and will not allow them to undermine the unity between and within our ethnic groups.

    加强民族团结，反对原子战争
                      西康省藏族自治区人民政府主席　桑吉悦希
    西康省藏族自治区的五十万藏、彝、回、汉各族人民和全国及全世界爱好和平的人民一样，坚决反对美帝国主义使用原子武器和在我国台湾所进行的一切战争挑衅。我们十分清楚，苏联一贯为着人类繁荣、进步的事业而进行原子能和平用途方面的研究。美国却恰恰相反，它为达到霸占外国领土的目的，正疯狂地叫嚣和准备原子战争。有着反对帝国主义的丰富经验和光荣传统的中国人民，不怕任何战争威胁。如果美帝国主义要把战争强加在我国人民头上，我们有力量击溃它。这是在解放战争中和朝鲜战场上所证实了的。
    我们西康省藏族自治区各族人民，从解放后就在祖国大家庭里享受着民族平等的权利，摆脱了帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团的压迫。毛主席、中国共产党和祖国人民几年来对自治区巨大的关怀和帮助，使自治区的经济、文化有了发展，人民的生活逐步改善，民族团结日益巩固。这些情况在历史上从未有过。少数民族光明远大的前景、繁荣幸福的社会主义社会，正在鼓舞着自治区各族人民从事英勇的和平劳动。我们自治区的各族人民对帝国主义和蒋介石卖国集团的血腥统治和压迫记忆犹新，决不容忍它们的罪恶阴谋得逞。我们自治区的人民将用以下的行动支援解放台湾，反对使用原子武器：第一，进一步增强民族团结，继续深入贯彻我区的团结爱国公约和团结治安决议。第二，做好一九五五年的农牧业生产工作，继续贯彻我区的农牧业生产政策，增加农产品和土特产品的生产，减少牲畜疫病死亡。第三，我们随时提高警惕，防止和揭露敌特分子造谣破坏活动，不容许他们破坏我们民族之间和民族内部的团结。
