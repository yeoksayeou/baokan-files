    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 11th: According to a report from the German News Agency (DPA) in Berlin on the 11th, the Prime Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Otto Grotewohl, made a statement regarding Molotov's report on the international situation and the foreign policy of the Soviet government when he met with representatives of the German News Agency.

    Grotewohl first pointed out that Molotov's report once again pointed out to the German people the path towards a peaceful resolution of the national question and a happy future. At the same time, this report is also a program for the people of all countries, especially the people of the democratic and socialist camp, to fight for peace.

    Grotewohl then pointed out that, for the Germans, if the interests of peace and the freedom of the European people are taken into account, then the fundamental issue is to reunify Germany into a peace-loving and democratic country. The Soviet Union's proposal to hold a Four-Power Conference has been welcomed with hope by the vast majority of the German people. We hope that other countries responsible for resolving the German question will also agree to such consultations in accordance with the obligations stipulated in the Potsdam Declaration.

    Grotewohl pointed out that the main task of the peace and democratic forces of the German people at present is to prevent the ratification of the Paris Agreements. He called for strengthening this patriotic struggle.

    Grotewohl said that if the Paris Agreements are ratified and implemented, the eight European countries participating in the Moscow Conference will take effective measures to defend their security. The German Democratic Republic will by no means evade establishing national combat forces, which, together with the forces of friendly countries, will make their contribution to defending peace. Grotewohl concluded by repeating Molotov's statement: The adventure of war will inevitably end with the disaster of the aggressors.

    格罗提渥总理拥护莫洛托夫报告
    指出德国人民当前主要任务是阻止批准巴黎协定
    【新华社十二日讯】据德意志通讯社柏林十一日讯：德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥在接见德意志通讯社代表时，就莫洛托夫关于国际局势和苏联政府的外交政策的报告发表了谈话。
    格罗提渥首先指出：莫洛托夫的报告再一次向德国人民指出走向民族问题的和平解决和幸福前途的道路。同时，这个报告也是各国人民，特别是民主和社会主义阵营的人民，为和平而斗争的纲领。
    格罗提渥接着指出：对德国人来说，如果考虑到和平的利益和欧洲人民的自由，那么根本的问题就是把德国重新统一成为一个爱好和平的和民主的国家。苏联关于举行四大国会议的建议已经受到绝大多数德国人民的满怀希望的欢迎。我们希望对解决德国问题负有责任的其他国家也能按照波茨坦宣言所规定的义务同意这样的协商。
    格罗提渥指出：德国人民的和平和民主力量当前的主要任务是阻止巴黎协定的批准。他号召加强这一爱国斗争。
    格罗提渥说，如果巴黎协定获得批准并予实施，那么，参加莫斯科会议的八个欧洲国家将采取有效措施来保卫他们的安全。德意志民主共和国决不规避建立国家的战斗力量，这种力量将和友好国家的力量在一起，对保卫和平作出他们的贡献。格罗提渥最后重复了莫洛托夫的这句话：战争的冒险将不可避免地以侵略者的灾难而结束。
