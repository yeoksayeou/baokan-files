    The Storm is Coming
    — Chronicle of the Yangtze River Bridge Geological Survey Team (1)
    By Our Correspondent Lu Hao
    The weather is truly fickle; suddenly, its face changed again.
    Although the sun only showed its weak, pale light, it still shone on the rippling surface of the river, causing the muddy water to glimmer slightly. The sails on the awning boats were sometimes slack; sometimes the white sails, like giant fans, listlessly swayed on the masts. The weather was neither clearly sunny nor overcast, but no one expected it to change so quickly.
    Something like a thick fog, carrying yellowish-brown dust, appeared at the junction of the sky and water upstream of the Yangtze River, and then swarmed over, instantly seeming to envelop the entire earth in dimness. The ancient buildings around the Yellow Crane Tower, which were originally clearly visible, gradually became blurred as if covered by something. The cloud layer seemed to be falling, and large chunks of dark gray clouds were connected together. The banks of the Yangtze River howled, emitting a thunderous sound. Waves chased after each other, and the busy wooden boats sailing on this vast river surface quickly hid in the Han River.
    A storm is coming.
    At this time, only one sixty-ton wooden boat (at that time, there were no steel pontoons as large as they are now) from the Yangtze River Bridge Geological Survey Team in the heart of the river had not sought shelter from the storm. The wooden boat nodded and swayed in the undulating river water like a cradle, and the diesel engine that drove the drill rig rhythmically and powerfully emitted a "clank—clank—clank" sound. At the No. 7 pier site, the drillers were concentrating on their work. Only a few centimeters remained for this borehole to be completed. "A storm is coming!" someone shouted. The wooden boat was rocking violently, and the waves in the river hit the wooden boat, making a "geba, geba" sound, as if it were about to fall apart. Some of the drillers who came from the north and were not used to living on the water could not stand on the boat. Some began to feel dizzy; some could not help but vomit. The engine captain, Zhang Qifa, had seen this situation on the deck early on. This driller, who started fighting the wind and waves on the Yangtze River at the age of eight and is now thirty-eight years old, knew that a dangerous storm was coming soon. He immediately issued an order. He said: "Quickly raise the drill pipe, leave four people on the boat, and the rest hurry ashore."
    "Why go ashore?"
    "A storm is coming, and if you're any later, you won't be able to get ashore." As he spoke, he directed the lifting of the drill pipe. He didn't allow everyone to argue and urged people to get into the small sampan.
    The small sampan was like a toy in the wind and waves. It was tied to the side of the wooden boat and was squeezed by the waves, directly colliding with the wooden boat. The thin, square hull was completely covered with water by the waves.
    The wooden boat "Wuhan," which was usually responsible for transportation and was equipped with a diesel engine, now walked on the waves like a bloated, elderly old lady, swaying from side to side. Sometimes it swayed so much that even the bottom of the boat could be seen. The driver's cab was also flooded with water, and it dared not and could not approach the wooden boat to perform the usual task of transporting drillers.
    When the small sampan was hit by a wave, it was almost level with the deck of the wooden boat. Taking advantage of this time, Zhang Qifa pulled and supported the drillers one by one onto the small sampan, and finally untied the cable and jumped onto the small sampan.
    Zhang Qifa rowed with two oars, took off his cotton coat, and rowed the small sampan towards the shore.
    The small sampan clung tightly to the crest of the waves. With each wave, the small sampan moved forward a few steps. When a wave passed, the small sampan seemed to be deeply trapped in the surging river, and mountain-like waves wrapped around it like a wall, as if it would immediately sink to the bottom of the river. Another wave rolled over, and the small sampan pierced through the crest again, and people were lifted up as if into the air.
    The trees on the shore were blown by the wind as if they were spinning, and trees as thick as rice bowls were blown down at once.
    Zhang Qifa finally sent them ashore, and he rowed the small sampan alone, braving even greater winds and waves, back to the side of the wooden boat.
    The wooden boat was sometimes lifted so high by the big waves that it seemed to stand upright, and people were so dizzy from the bumps that it seemed as if their internal organs were about to be turned out. The four people now left on the boat, some climbed to the four- or five-meter-high drilling tower, and some had already raised the drilling tools...
    The leaders of the geological survey team headquarters had learned of the coming storm and wanted to provide some assistance to this wooden boat, so they called the Yangtze River Navigation Administration to ask for help. The Yangtze River Navigation Administration immediately sent a ship. However, the ship braved the wind and waves to the side of the wooden boat, but because it was afraid of overturning it, it did not dare to approach. It sounded its friendly whistle and circled the wooden boat a few times, but had no choice but to leave helplessly.
    The waves soaked everyone on the wooden boat, and even the luggage and bedding in the rear cabin were soaked in water. Because the No. 7 pier site did not have a cover layer, the violent shaking of the wooden boat caused the iron anchor, which was originally thrown on the rock, to move slightly, and the bow of the boat was slightly turned towards Hanyang, and the entire hull moved a bit.
    Although the wind and waves were very large, it was probably both because of the tailwind and because the boat was only more than two hundred meters away from the shore, Zhang Qifa heard someone yelling at him. He looked up at the shore and saw that the comrades who had just gone ashore had not left, and were anxiously beckoning him. "Master Zhang, Master Zhang!" "Master Zhang, come—, we want—to board the ship. We—want to board the ship."
    He couldn't hear these words very clearly, he only knew that there was something on shore for him. At that time, even the ships on the river had stopped sailing. Only the small sampan rowed by Zhang Qifa was bravely traveling on the crest of the waves.
    "You guys go back, what are you calling us for?" Zhang Qifa asked as the small sampan approached the shore.
    "The boat is a little crooked, the four of you are not enough, quickly bring us up."
    "Master Zhang, let us go back to the boat and protect state property with you."
    "The wind and waves are too big, you can't handle it." He saw that some drillers were still vomiting. He said.
    "It doesn't matter, let's go up and try."
    This kind of request cannot be refused by anyone. He let them onto the small sampan.
    The roaring wind and waves on the river emitted a terrifying sound that shook people's hearts. The heavens and the earth were filled with the "hua—hua—hua" howling sound, as if it were going to swallow everything.
    As soon as the small sampan approached the wooden boat, they collided with each other. A wave rolled over, lifting the wooden boat very high, while the small sampan seemed to sink to the bottom of the wooden boat. After the wave passed, the wooden boat also fell, and the small sampan could not avoid it. Its bow was pressed against the side of the wooden boat, and there was a "cha" sound, and the mast of the small sampan was also broken. The rocking of the wooden boat made people feel as if they were drunk, staggering and unsteady.
    People boarded the wooden boat, and Zhou Changli climbed to the four- or five-meter-high drilling tower to hold the casing, which had been raised more than one meter, but it was crooked because the wooden boat was shaking violently. Song Guangyu immediately整理锚绳 [sorted out the anchor rope]….
    The strong wind blew continuously for nearly twenty hours. It was not until the afternoon of the next day that the wind gradually weakened. As soon as the wind weakened, the diesel engine immediately sang rhythmically again, and the drilling work at the No. 7 pier was quickly completed.
    Although the wind and waves on the Yangtze River have temporarily stopped, its overflowing flood will soon threaten Zhang Qifa's family.
    His family lives on the edge of the Yangtze River. Water has seeped through the floor of the room, the children can no longer get out of bed, and adults have to pad their feet with bricks and planks when walking around the house.
    Many families have moved to higher ground. Although his home is not far from the drilling ship, someone urged him to move, but he agreed verbally but did not leave the ship.
    At this time, he really couldn't take care of his family. One borehole was completed, and then a new borehole work was about to begin, and the No. 2 pier was in the process of raising anchor.
    The entire anchor and anchor chain were buried in a cover layer several meters deep. More than twenty people pushed the winch to turn it from eight o'clock in the morning to the afternoon. Despite their best efforts, the iron anchor seemed to have taken root in the bottom of the river and could not be pulled up. However, the weather was gradually getting dark.
    What to do? The derrick barge has no signal lights and cannot be stopped in the middle of the river. If you want to use a wooden boat to replace it, you are afraid that the wooden boat will be damaged at night. If you say to pull the anchor chain to the shore, the boat cannot reach the shore at that time. No one could come up with a solution for a while.
    At this time, Zhang Qifa thought that everyone had been working for a day (in fact, he himself had been working for a day), and now they should go back to rest. He said: "Give me a kerosene lamp as a signal, you go back, I'll stay here!"
    "How can you stay here alone?"
    "It's just one night, I can go without sleep. Don't worry about me, hurry back and rest." He impatiently urged everyone.
    Su Kelin, the deputy captain of the geological survey team, was also on the boat at this time. He said: "No. It is not possible to stay here alone."
    As soon as he finished speaking, the sailors on the No. 1 ship spoke. They said: "Then we won't leave either. We can turn on all the electric lights and dock with the derrick barge, and Master Zhang can sleep in our cabin."
    Captain Su and the drillers were relieved to take the boat back to shore.
    That night was overcast, and the entire river surface was pitch black. Only the rows and rows of pearl-like lights on the banks of the three towns of Wuhan were shining. The derrick barge was a bare iron plate. Zhang Qifa sat alone on the deck. He wiped the glass cover of the kerosene lamp brightly and lit the lamp.
    The sailors of the No. 1 ship came over to invite him to sleep in the cabin, but he did not go. He said: "In this dark night, if the wind blows out the kerosene lamp and the sailing ships cannot see the signal, if they collide, they will overturn the ship." He looked out at the wide, rolling river around the ship and guarded it all night, and when the drillers went to work early the next morning, he had cleaned the derrick barge spotlessly.
    He came back from the ship and met Captain Su. As soon as Captain Su saw him, he said: "The house you live in is flooded, go back and move today."
    "Let's talk about it tomorrow. I don't have time today."
    "I'll give you a day off today, and allocate a small sampan to you. You must go back and move."
    He walked home, and the water on the street was already waist-high. The water in his room was also two inches deep, cracks had appeared in the wall, and everything in the room was padded high.
    He returned home and saw that the foundations of several neighbors' houses were also submerged in water. The men of these families had all gone out, and the remaining women and children were worried about moving. So he helped his neighbors move first, and finally moved his own home.
    Our Yangtze River is bound to suffer from typhoons and waves. As long as they hear the wind blowing, the drillers will run to the riverbank no matter what time it is.
    One night, before twelve o'clock, people were once again awakened by the strong wind on the river. In the dormitory, although no one greeted anyone, everyone met on the riverbank.
    Standing on the embankment, the strong wind really seemed to blow people into the river. Only the signal lights of the sailing ships could be seen shining on the water in the middle of the river, and the entire hull was swallowed by the darkness.
    They looked at the direction in which the drilling ship was anchored and could not see anything. They knew that although there was no work on the ship tonight, the lights should not have been turned off.
    "Let's go on board to check." In the darkness, everyone knew it was Zhang Qifa's voice. He quickly ran towards the small sampan next to the pier, and then a few people followed him.
    Too many people came, and the small sampan couldn't carry many people. Besides, the waves were hitting as high as small mountains. Zhang Qifa said: "Okay, okay, four people at most will do."
    Among these four people, Zhou Tingrui squeezed in. He was a native of the north. He had always lived on land and couldn't swim at all. Zhang Qifa said to him: "Forget it, don't go." Little Zhou wouldn't listen.
    The small sampan left the shore, and a small section of sail was still raised on its mast. Because the wind was strong, even though a small section of sail was raised, the small sampan passed through the crests and troughs of the waves like an arrow. In the darkness, after a while, even the small section of white sail disappeared. More than ten minutes later, the lights on the drilling ship were turned on again. Although this light was small, it was like an immortal star in the darkness and strong wind, shining with the courage and confidence of the drillers.

    风浪来了
    ——长江大桥地质钻探队纪事之一
    本报记者　陆灏
    天气真是反复无常，突然间，它的脸色又变了。
    太阳虽然只是露出它微弱的淡白色的光辉，但在水波鳞鳞的江面上，仍然还照射得浑浊的江水微微发光。篷船上的帆索有时松弛着；有时白帆像把巨大的扇子一样，没精打采地在桅杆上摇晃。天气说晴不晴，说阴不阴，但谁也没有想到会变得这样快。
    像浓雾一般的带着土黄色的烟尘似的东西，在长江的上游天和水的交接处出现，接着就蜂涌过来，霎时间，它把整个大地都好像卷在昏暗中了。本来清晰可见的黄鹤楼一带的古老的建筑，也渐渐地盖上了什么东西似的而模糊不清了。云层似乎要坠下来，深灰色的云彩大块大块地连在一起。长江的两岸呼啸着，发出一种雷轰的声音，波浪一个追赶着一个，行驶在这辽阔的江面上的繁忙的木船，很快都隐藏到汉水去了。
    风浪要来了。
    这时候，江心只有长江大桥地质钻探队的一只六十吨的木船（那时间还没有像现在这样大的钢铁的趸船）没有去躲避风浪。木船像只摇篮一样，在起伏的江水中点头摆脑，带动钻机转动的柴油机吭——吭——吭地发出有节奏的有力量的声音。七号墩址的钻孔上，钻工们正聚精会神地在工作，这个钻孔还有几公寸的进尺，工作就能结束了。“要起风了！”不知是谁，大喊了一声。木船颠簸得很厉害，江里的浪头把木船击打得发出格巴格巴的响声，简直好像要酥了一样。从北方来的不习惯在水上生活的钻工们，有的已经蹲在船上站立不住了。有的开始头晕；有的已忍不住呕吐起来。机长张启发在舱面上早看到了这种情形。这个从八岁就开始在长江上面和风浪搏斗今年已经三十八岁的水手出身的钻工，他知道一场凶险的风浪马上就要来了。他马上发出了命令。他说：“赶快起钻杆，船上留下四个人，其余的赶快上岸。”“为什么上岸？”
    “要起风浪了，再晚你们就上不了岸了。”他一面说着，一面指挥着提钻杆。他不容大家分辩，催促人们上小划子去。
    小划子在风浪里像个玩具一样，它拴在木船头的边，被浪头挤得直和木船相撞，又瘦又方的船身被浪头浇得全都是水。
    那只有着柴油机装置的平时担任运输的木船“武汉”号，现在像个臃肿年迈的老太太，一摇一摆在浪尖上滑着行走，有时晃得连船底也看得见了。驾驶室里也被打进了水，它已经不敢也不能靠近木船履行平常运送钻工的任务了。
    小划子被一个浪头打上来的时候，它简直和木船的船面几乎就一样平了。张启发乘这个时间，他把钻工一个一个连拉带扶地送到小划子上去，他最后解了缆绳跳上了小划子。
    张启发划着两支桨，他把棉衣一脱，把小划子划向岸边去。
    小划子紧紧地贴在浪尖上，一个浪头过来，小划子就向前进几步。一个浪头过去，小划子像深陷在汹涌的江水里，小山般高的波涛像围墙一样地裹住了它，它好像立刻要沉没在江底了。又一个浪头滚过来，小划子又穿到了浪头上，人像腾空般地被掀起来。
    岸上的树木被大风刮得好像在打转，有饭碗口那么粗的树一下子就被吹倒了。
    张启发终于把他们送到了岸上，他一个人划着小划子，冒着更大的风浪，回到了木船的身旁。
    那木船有时被大浪头掀得好像要竖立起来一样，人被颠得晕头晕脑，好像五脏六腑都要被倒出来似的。船上现在留下的四个人，他们有的就爬到四五公尺高的钻塔上去，有的已经把钻具提升上来……。
    地质钻探队队部的领导人员已经得知狂风来临的消息，他们想给这只木船一点援助，于是打电话给长江航务局请他们帮忙。长江航务局马上派来了一只轮船。可是轮船冒着风浪到了这只木船的旁边，因为怕撞翻它，结果也不敢靠拢来。它鸣叫着亲切的汽笛，在木船的周围转了几圈，也只好无可奈何地走了。
    浪头把木船上的人都浸得全身是水，连后舱的行李被服也被浸在水里了。七号墩址因为没有覆盖层，木船剧烈的动荡使本来抛在岩石上的铁锚有点走动，船头微微地扭向汉阳，整个的船身有点动了。
    风浪虽然很大，大约一来是顺风；二来是船靠岸只有二百多公尺远，张启发听得有人在吆呼他。他抬头朝岸上一看，原来是刚才上岸的同志们还没有走，而且在用手躁急地招呼他。“张师傅，张—师—傅。”“张师傅，来—，我们要—上船。我们—要上船。”
    这些话，他听不太清楚，只知道岸上有事情找他。那时江面上，连轮船也已经停止航行了。只有张启发划的那只小划子，在浪头的尖尖上勇敢地行走。
    “你们回去算了，喊我们干什么？”小划子靠了岸，张启发问。
    “船有点歪了，你们四个人不够的，赶快把我们带上去。”
      “张师傅，让我们回到船上去和你们一同保护国家财产。”
    “风浪太大，你们受不了的。”他看到有的钻工还在呕吐呢。他说。
      “不要紧，我们上去试试看。”
    这种要求是谁也不能够拒绝的。他让他们上了小划子。
    江上怒吼着的风浪发出一种震人心弦的恐怖的声音。天地间被哗——哗——哗的呼啸声充塞了，好像要把什么都吞没似的。
    小划子一靠近木船，它们互相就相撞起来。一个浪头卷过来，把木船掀得老高，而小划子却好像沉落到木船的身底下去了。浪头一过，木船也接着落下来，小划子躲避不及，它的船头被压在木船身边，只听?——嚓——一声，小划子的桅杆也被压断了。木船颠簸得使人们都好像喝醉了酒似的，踉踉跄跄，走路也没有准。
    人们上了木船，周长礼就爬到四五公尺高的钻塔上去扶套管，套管已经提上来一公尺多，因为木船震动得厉害而歪了。宋光裕马上整理锚绳……。
    大风连续刮了将近二十小时。直到第二天下午，风才渐渐微弱下来。风一微，柴油机马上又有节奏地歌唱起来了，七号墩的钻探工作很快就完成了。
    长江的风浪虽然是暂时停了，但它的泛滥的洪水，不久以后就威胁着张启发的家庭。
    他的家庭住在长江的边上，房间的地上已经透出水来，孩子们已经不能下床，大人在屋子里走动，脚下也得垫着砖块和铺着木板。
    很多人家都搬向高地去了。虽然是他的家离开钻船不远，有人催他搬家，他嘴答应，人却不离船上。
    这时候，他真的是顾不上家。一个钻孔完了，接着又要开始新的钻孔工作，二号墩正在进行起锚工作。
    整个的锚和锚链被埋在几公尺深的覆盖层里，二十几个人推着绞盘转，从上午八点开始绞到下午，用尽办法，这个铁锚像在江底里生了根似的，绞不上来。可是，天气已经渐渐黑下来了。
    这怎么办呢？扒杆船上没有信号灯，它是不能够停在江心的。想用木船来代替它，又怕木船在夜里被撞坏。说把锚链拉到岸上去，但当时船不能靠到岸边。一时谁也拿不出个办法来。
    这时候，张启发想到大家已经工作了一天（其实，他自己也工作了一天了），现在应该回去休息。他说：“给我一盏马灯当讯号，你们回去吧，我留在这里好了！”
      “你一个人怎么能留在这里呢？”
    “只是一个黑夜，可以不睡。你们别为我操心了，赶快回去休息吧。”他不耐烦地催促着大家。
    地质钻探队的苏克林副队长这时也在船上。他说：“不行。一个人留在这里是不行的。”
    他的话刚说完，一号轮船的水手们说话了。他们说：“那我们也不走了。我们可以把全部的电灯都开着，和扒杆船靠在一起，张师傅可以睡在我们的舱里。”
    苏队长和钻工们这才放心乘船回到岸上去。
    这一夜是阴天，整个的江面漆黑一片，只有武汉三镇堤边一行一行的、一累一累的像珍珠般地灯光在闪耀，扒杆船上是光溜溜的铁板，张启发一个人坐在舱面上，他把马灯的玻璃罩擦得亮亮的，点着了灯。
    一号轮的水手们过来招呼他去舱里睡觉，他没有去。他说：“在这黑夜里，要是风把马灯吹熄了，航行的船看不到信号，如果碰上来，会撞翻船的。”他了望着船四周的宽阔的滚滚的江水，整整守了一夜，等到钻工们第二天一早上班，他已经把扒杆船打扫得干干净净了。
    他从船上回来，碰见了苏队长。苏队长一见他，就说：“你住的房子已经进水了，今天赶快回去搬家吧。”
    “明天再说吧。今天我没有时间。”
    “今天给你一天假期，还拨给你一只小划子。一定要回去搬家。”
    他走回家去，街上的水已经和腰一般齐了。他的房间里的水也有两公寸深了，墙上已裂了缝，房里的东西什么都被垫得高高的。
    他回到家里，他看到几家邻居的房子的地基也被淹在水里了。这几家人家的男人们都出门去了，剩下的女人和孩子们正在为搬家发愁。于是他帮邻居们先搬了家，最后才把自己的家搬走。
    我们的长江，断不了要遭受大风大浪的袭击。只要一听起风，钻探队员们不论是在什么时候，都会跑到江边上来。
    有一夜，不到十二点，人们又一次被江上的大风惊醒了。在宿舍里，虽然谁也没有招呼谁，但大家都在江边碰上了。
    站在堤边，大风真像要把人吹到大江里去似的。江心里只看见航行着的轮船的信号灯在水面上闪着光，而整个船身都给这黑夜吞噬了。
    他们一看钻船停泊的方向，什么也看不见，船上的灯都已经熄灭了。他们知道今天晚上船上虽然没有工作，但灯是不应该熄灭的。
      “咱们上船去检查检查吧。”在黑暗中，大家一听知道这是张启发的声音。只见他一个人迅速地跑向码头旁边的小划子去，接着有几个人跟着他跑了过去。
    人来得太多了，小划子哪里能载下很多人。再说，浪头打得像小山那样高。张启发说：“行了，行了，最多四个人就可以了。”
    在这四个人里，挤上来的有周庭瑞，他是道地的北方人，他一直生长在陆地上，根本不会泅水。张启发对他说：“算了吧，你别去了。”小周哪里肯听。
    小划子离了岸，他的桅杆上还扯起了一小截帆。因为风大，虽然是扯起一小截帆，小划子就像支箭似地在浪头和浪头的尖尖上穿过去。在黑暗中，一会儿，连那一小截白帆也消失了。在十几分钟以后，只见钻船上的灯又重新亮起来了。这灯光虽小，但在黑暗和大风中却像一颗不灭的星星，它闪烁着钻探队员们的勇敢和信心。
