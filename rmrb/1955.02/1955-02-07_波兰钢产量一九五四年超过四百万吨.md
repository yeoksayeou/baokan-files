　　Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, February 6th: Poland's steel production exceeded four million tons for the first time in 1954, almost reaching three times the pre-war level of 1938. This figure does not include the output of the huge Lenin Metallurgical Combine, which began producing its first batch of steel on February 4, 1955.
　　From 1946 to 1954, Poland's average annual increase in steel production was about 12 percent, twice as fast as that of the United Kingdom, three times as fast as that of France, and five times as fast as that of Italy. Poland's steel production has already exceeded that of Italy. Calculated per capita, Poland produced 20 percent less steel than Italy in 1938, but now it produces almost twice as much as Italy.
　　Poland's steel production before the war averaged about 41 kilograms per person per year. This year, it will reach about 170 kilograms. Due to the rapid increase in steel production, Poland's machinery industry has developed rapidly, and its output per capita has reached more than 15 times the pre-war level.
　　In 1954, Poland's iron and steel industry began producing many new types of steel that are very important for the further development of the national economy and defense industry.

    波兰钢产量一九五四年超过四百万吨
    【新华社华沙六日电】　波兰的钢产量在一九五四年第一次超过了四百万吨，差不多达到了战前一九三八年水平的三倍。这个数字还不包括已在一九五五年二月四日开始生产第一批钢的巨大的列宁冶金联合企业的产量。
    从一九四六年到一九五四年，波兰每年钢产量的平均增加率是百分之十二左右，比英国快一倍，比法国快三倍，比意大利快五倍。波兰钢产量已经超过意大利。如果按照人口平均计算，一九三八年波兰生产的钢比意大利少百分之二十，而现在却差不多比意大利多了一倍。
    波兰钢产量在战前按人口平均计算每人每年约合四十一公斤，今年将达到一百七十公斤左右。由于钢铁生产的迅速增加，波兰机器业就得到了飞快的发展，它的产量按人口平均计算已经达到战前水平的十五倍以上。
    一九五四年波兰钢铁工业开始生产了许多种对于进一步发展国民经济和国防工业十分重要的新型的钢。
