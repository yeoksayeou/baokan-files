    Be Sure to Distribute Relief Funds Well in Disaster Areas
    Internal Affairs Ministry Relief Department
    According to the requirements of the disaster relief work conference held by the Ministry of Internal Affairs last October, in recent months, all severely affected disaster areas have attached importance to the distribution of relief funds. Following the principle of "combining leadership control with democratic appraisal," a large amount of relief funds has been distributed. In areas where the work has been done well, the relief funds have not only solved the difficulties of the disaster victims but also greatly encouraged their enthusiasm for production. In areas where the work has not been done well, the phenomena of stockpiling, misappropriation, and embezzlement of relief funds that occurred in the past have also been reduced.
    Relief funds are the material force for organizing disaster victims to engage in production for self-salvation. If the relief funds are distributed and used well, they can effectively help disaster victims overcome the disaster. Disaster victims need relief, but the degree of need varies. Therefore, the distribution of relief funds should be as reasonable as possible to prevent deviations. This requires in-depth and meticulous work in advance, adhering to the principle of "leadership control and democratic appraisal." The so-called leadership control means that cadre meetings should be held from top to bottom to explain relief policies and methods, understand the situation, and reasonably allocate relief fund quotas. The so-called democratic appraisal means that the masses should be organized to discuss the recipients of relief funds and the amount of funds to be distributed. Through this discussion, the relief funds can be truly distributed to those who need them and truly play a role in supporting disaster victims. Without leadership control and without doing this work well, convening mass meetings or township people's congress meetings for appraisal often does not yield good results. However, if there is only leadership control and no democratic appraisal, the relief fund distribution plan cannot be grasped by the people, and it is easy for improper distribution or embezzlement by individual cadres to occur.
    To do a good job in distributing a large amount of relief funds, a management system for relief funds should also be established. Account books and reports need to be set up, which requires someone to do this work; eating and lighting lamps during meetings require some money. These are all necessary, with minimal expenditure and maximum effectiveness. Because if the distribution of relief funds is done well, not only will the lives of disaster victims be guaranteed and their enthusiasm for production be further enhanced, but also the connection between the people and the government will be further strengthened through this work.
    There are many examples of correct distribution of relief funds in various disaster-stricken areas. Through the distribution of relief funds, these areas have further implemented the disaster relief policy, encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses for production and self-salvation, and economical disaster mitigation, and a vigorous atmosphere has emerged in the disaster areas. Yumin Township in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, is a good example.
    Yumin Township in Xiangyin County, Hunan Province, has 530 households and 2,887 people, and is a severely affected township in the lakeside area. After the township was hit by the disaster, the government successively distributed relief funds seven times, solving the urgent difficulties of the disaster victims and supporting flood prevention and rescue and the safe transfer of disaster victims. However, due to deviations in the distribution work, such as subjective decision-making by cadres, secret distribution, blind and indiscriminate distribution, average distribution, and even misappropriation and embezzlement, great dissatisfaction among the masses was caused. After the disaster victims returned to their hometowns, the government allocated more than 60 million yuan in relief funds and more than 21 million yuan in loans to support the disaster victims in restoring production and rebuilding their homes. The distribution of relief funds and loans in this township was done very well this time. The specific methods are as follows:
    First, a party branch meeting was held to summarize the previous work of distributing relief funds and loans and to study the current production situation in the township. Then, a meeting of party members, league members, women, and activists was held. Members of the party branch committee and main township cadres reported on the previous work of distributing relief funds and loans, affirmed the achievements, pointed out the shortcomings, criticized the idea of some disaster victims who simply relied on government relief and the idea of selfishness, and then guided everyone to conduct discussions, so that everyone reached a unified understanding ideologically. After the meeting, mainly party members and cadres, conducted positive interviews and side-by-side understanding with the masses in groups, and clarified the relief targets. Based on the information obtained, the party branch and township cadres studied and formulated a "preliminary list" to determine that the township was divided into three categories of relief households and loan households: The first category, the old, weak, disabled, and seriously affected families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel with empty family property, were fully relief households; the second category, households with many people, few laborers, and severely affected disasters, and poor families of revolutionary martyrs and military personnel, were half-relief and half-loan households; the third category, those with strong labor force who can engage in self-salvation through production but are still facing production difficulties are considered loan households.
      After the "preliminary list" was determined, a township people's congress meeting was held to further criticize the egalitarianism of "everyone should get a little" existing among the masses, to explain in detail the policy of self-salvation through production and the methods of distributing relief funds and loans, and to publish the "preliminary list" for representatives to discuss in groups. As a result of the discussion, the "preliminary list" was revised (nine households were changed). The meeting also made a resolution on the principles of using relief funds and loans.
    After the township people's congress meeting, the resolution of the township people's congress was conveyed to agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and residential groups, and everyone was mobilized to discuss the resolution and evaluate the distribution list of relief funds and loans. The discussion and evaluation process was a process of ideological education. Before the discussion and evaluation, many relief households were not concerned enough about others because they received relief themselves; households that were evaluated less tried to get more; and individual loan households were dissatisfied and wanted to get relief funds. In response to these ideas, in the discussion, people's representatives and activists used the method of recollection and comparison at any time to persuade and educate the masses, so that the evaluation work was successfully completed. After repeated discussions, the masses believed that the distribution method of relief funds and loans this time was very fair; only a few households were not reasonable enough, and they were also corrected according to everyone's opinions. Finally, the method of distributing relief funds and loans was approved by the whole township and reported to the district for approval, and the list was posted for final approval.
    In order to use this batch of funds well, after the list was posted for final approval, the township also held meetings of agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and residential groups to educate the masses on self-salvation through production and economical disaster mitigation, and mobilized disaster victims to formulate plans for using relief funds and loans. For households that did not receive relief funds and loans, they were also educated in a timely manner to encourage them to actively engage in production.
    In order not to hinder production, meetings for discussing the distribution of relief funds and loans were held at night.
    Because the work of distributing relief funds and loans in this township was done very well, within six days after the distribution, the township built 51 houses, rushed to plant more than 170 mu of rapeseed and 58 mu of broad beans, and set off a boom in production and self-salvation.
    The practice of Yumin Township in Xiangyin County in distributing relief funds according to the principle of "leadership control and democratic appraisal" has proved to be correct and has produced the inevitable good results. At present, many areas are carrying out the work of distributing relief funds. In this work, all localities should refer to the experience of Yumin Township to check the work in their own areas and correct deviations so as to make the relief funds truly distributed fairly and reasonably. However, the experience of Yumin Township should not be mechanically applied, and all localities should proceed from the actual situation in their own areas. For example, the "three-list finalization" method is aimed at making the distribution of relief funds truly fair and reasonable. If other simpler democratic appraisal methods can achieve the same purpose of fairness, rationality, and mass satisfaction, there is no need to "finalize the case with three lists." The classification methods of relief households should also be determined according to the specific conditions of the local area. Even so, "leadership control and democratic appraisal" should be the principles that all localities must adhere to when distributing relief funds. The specific method of distribution should generally adopt
  the method of "one-time evaluation and distribution in installments". After one evaluation, if there is a major change in the disaster situation during the distribution process, it can be re-evaluated and increased or decreased as appropriate. Distribution in installments does not mean regular supply, and should be treated differently according to the actual situation of the relief recipients. For example, for cooperatives and mutual aid teams organized for production, or industrious individual farmers, it can be distributed at one time; for the disabled, elderly, orphans, and widows who need long-term relief or individuals who are unwilling to engage in production, it can be distributed in installments. In order to do a good job in the distribution of relief funds, people's governments at all levels should conduct regular supervision and inspection, discover good experiences, promote them in a timely manner, and discover shortcomings and deviations and correct them in a timely manner, so as to ensure that the relief funds are distributed reasonably and play their due role.

    一定要把灾区的救济款发放好
    内务部救济司
    根据去年十月内务部召开的救灾工作会议的要求，近几个月来，各重灾区都重视了救济款的发放工作，按照“领导掌握和民主评议相结合”的方针，发放了大批救济款。做得好的地区，救济款不仅解决了灾民的困难，而且大大鼓舞了灾民的生产积极性；做得不够好的地区，也减少了过去曾经发生过的积压、挪用和贪污救济款的现象。
    救济款是组织灾民生产自救的物质力量，救济款发放、使用得好，就能够有效地帮助灾民战胜灾荒。灾民需要救济，但需要救济的程度不同。因此，救济款的发放应该尽量作到合理，防止偏差，而这必须事先进行深入细致的工作，坚持“领导掌握、民主评议”的方针。所谓领导掌握，就是要自上而下地开好干部会议，交代救济政策和办法，摸清情况，合理分配救济款指标。所谓民主评议，就是要组织群众讨论救济款的发放对象，发放数字，通过这种讨论，使救济款真正发给需要救济的人，真正起到支援灾民的作用。没有领导掌握，不做好这步工作，就召集群众或召开乡人民代表大会会议评议，往往得不出好的结果。但是只有领导掌握，没有民主评议，救济款发放方案不能为人民所掌握，就容易发生发放失当或个别干部贪污等毛病。
    做好大量救济款的发放工作，还应该建立救济款的管理制度。要设立帐簿、表报等，就需要有人作这种工作；开会时吃饭、点灯，要用点钱。这些都是需要的，花费很小，收效极大。因为救济款的发放工作作好了，不仅灾民的生活得到保障，更加提高灾民的生产积极性，而且通过这一工作，人民和政府的联系也将会得到进一步的加强。
    正确发放救济款的事例，各个受灾地区都有不少。这些地区，通过救济款的发放工作，进一步贯彻了救灾政策，鼓舞了群众生产自救、节约度荒的积极性，灾区出现了蓬蓬勃勃的气象。湖南省湘阴县裕民乡是一个很好的例子。
    湖南省湘阴县裕民乡有五百三十户、二千八百八十七人，是滨湖区的重灾乡。这个乡受灾后，政府曾先后发放七次救济款，解决了灾民燃眉之急的困难，支持了防汛抢险和灾民安全转移。但由于发放工作中发生了干部主观决定、秘密发放、盲目滥发、平均分配甚至挪用、贪污等偏差，引起群众很大不满。灾民返乡后，政府为了支援灾民恢复生产、重建家园，又拨发救济款六千多万元和贷款二千一百多万元。该乡这次救济款和贷款的发放工作做得很好，具体作法是：
    首先，召开党支部会，总结了过去发放救济款和贷款的工作，研究了全乡当前生产情况。接着召开了党员、团员、妇女、积极分子会议，由党支部委员和乡主要干部报告了过去发放救济款和贷款的工作，肯定了成绩，指出了缺点，批判了部分灾民单纯依赖政府救济的思想和自私观念，然后引导大家进行了讨论，使大家在思想上取得了一致的认识。会后，以党员和干部为主，分片向群众进行了正面访问和侧面了解，摸清了救济对象。根据了解的情况，党支部和乡干部研究订出了“初榜”，确定全乡共分三类救济户和贷款户：第一类，老、弱、残、疾和遭灾严重、家底空的烈属军属为全救济户；第二类，人口多，劳动力少而又遭灾严重的户和贫苦烈属军属为半救济半贷款户；第三类，劳动力强，可以生产自救，但目前生产仍有困难的为贷款户。
      “初榜”确定后，召开了乡人民代表大会会议，进一步批判了群众中存在的“大家都得点”的平均主义思想，详细地交代了生产自救政策和救济款、贷款发放办法，并发布“初榜”，由代表分组讨论。讨论结果，对“初榜”作了修正（变动了九户）。会议并作出救济款和贷款发放使用原则的决议。
    乡人民代表大会会议开过后，接着以农业生产合作社、互助组和居民组为单位，传达乡人民代表大会决议，并发动大家讨论决议和评议救济款和贷款分配名单。讨论评议过程是思想教育过程。在讨论评议之前，许多被救济户因为自己得到救济，而对别人不够关心；被评少的户力求多得；个别贷款户不满，想得到救济款。针对这些思想，在讨论中，人民代表和积极分子随时用回忆对比方法，向群众进行说服教育，使评议工作顺利完成。经过反复讨论，群众认为这次救济款和贷款的发放办法很公道；只有几户不够合理，也按大家意见改正了。最后发放救济款和贷款办法经全乡通过，报区批准后，张榜定案。
    为了使用好这批款项，张榜定案后，这个乡又召开了农业生产合作社、互助组和居民组会议，对群众进行了生产自救、节约渡荒的教育，发动灾民订出使用救济款和贷款的计划。对于没有得到救济款和贷款的户，也及时进行了教育，鼓励他们积极生产。
    为了不妨害生产，讨论发放救济款和贷款的会议都是在晚上开的。
    由于这个乡的救济款和贷款的发放工作做得很好，在发放后的六天中，全乡就修盖了房屋五十一栋，赶种了一百七十多亩油菜、五十八亩蚕豆，掀起了生产自救热潮。
    湘阴县裕民乡按照“领导掌握、民主评议”的方针发放救济款的做法，事实证明是正确的，因而产生了必然的良好效果。目前许多地区正在进行发放救济款的工作，在这一工作中，各地应该参照裕民乡的经验，对当地的工作进行检查，纠正偏差，以便使救济款真正发放得公平合理。但对裕民乡的经验，也不要机械搬用，各地应当从当地实际情况出发。如“三榜定案”的作法，目的在于使救济款的发放工作真正公平合理，如果采取其他更简易的民主评议办法，同样能够达到公正合理、群众满意的目的，就可以不必“三榜定案”。救济户分类办法，也都应该根据当地具体情况确定。虽然如此，但“领导掌握、民主评议”却应是各地发放救济款必须遵守的原则。而发放的具体办法一般应采取
  “一次评定、分期发放”的方式。一次评定后，如果在领发过程中，灾情确有重大变化时，可再酌情评议增加或者减少。分期发放，不等于定期供给，应当按照救济对象的实际情况，分别对待。如对组织起来进行生产的合作社、互助组，或者勤劳的单干农民，可一次发给；对于需要长期救济的残老孤寡或者个别不愿从事生产的人，可分期发给。为了做好救济款的发放工作，各级人民政府应该经常进行督导和检查，发现好的经验，及时推广，发现缺点偏差，及时纠正，以保证救济款发放合理，使它发挥应有的作用。
