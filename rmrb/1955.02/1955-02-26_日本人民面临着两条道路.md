The Japanese people are about to hold a general election, and they are facing two distinctly different paths. One path is to strive for independence and peace. This means breaking free from the state of being semi-occupied by the United States, achieving an independent and autonomous position, preventing the revival of militarism, and making due contributions to the cause of maintaining peace in Asia and the world. This aligns with the general trend of the Japanese political situation after the fall of the Yoshida government. The other path is to retrace the old road of the Yoshida government. This means willingly serving as a vassal of the United States, openly or covertly, reviving Japanese militarism, increasingly falling into the quagmire of the American policy of "using Asians to fight Asians," and endangering peace in Asia and the world. This is contrary to the current political trends in Japan.

The former path is warmly welcomed by the peoples of Asian countries, especially the Chinese people. The Japanese people are not isolated in their struggle for independence and peace. The Asian people, who are increasingly shaking off the shackles of colonial rule, especially the Chinese people who have achieved their own independence, deeply sympathize with the Japanese people's efforts to strive for independence and autonomy. The Japanese efforts to strive for independence and autonomy are not only in line with the national interests of the Japanese people, but also a necessary condition for Japan to break away from American aggression policies and war plans, and thus also in line with the interests of peace. We firmly believe that the Japanese people will find enough strength in themselves to overcome the difficulties on the road ahead. All activities that attempt to obstruct the Japanese people's progress and attempt to enslave the Japanese people are doomed to fail.

However, if some people in Japan still want to retrace the old road of the Yoshida government, willingly associate with Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, and act as tools of American aggression policies, that would be like pulling chestnuts out of the fire for the United States, and will inevitably be resolutely opposed by the broad masses of the Asian people, especially the Japanese people who are striving for independence. In the past, Japanese militarists once妄想conspired to conquer Asia and launched aggression in Asia, which resulted in unprecedented disasters for Japan and a tragic failure. Moreover, today's Asia is no longer the Asia of the past colonies and semi-colonies. The victory of China's 600 million people has brought about a historically significant change in Asia. Many Asian countries have achieved significant victories and progress in overthrowing colonial rule. The powerful people of the Soviet Union and China and the peace-loving people of Asian countries, including the Japanese people who are striving for independence, will never allow Japan to retrace the old road of militarist aggression.

The current political trend in Japan increasingly shows that the broad masses of the Japanese people are demanding to move towards the road of independence and peace. The broad masses of the Japanese people and enlightened people in various Japanese political parties are increasingly realizing that following the American aggression policy will only bring endless disasters to Japan. They demand to get rid of Japan's dependent status on the United States, they oppose re-militarization, they demand to restore normal relations with China and the Soviet Union and carry out trade and cultural ties, and they demand to live in peace with Asian countries and the world. These calls for independence and peace have formed an increasingly broad movement. The number of Japanese people who have signed petitions demanding the prohibition of atomic and hydrogen weapons has exceeded 22 million as of January 15. Well-known figures in Japanese political, economic, and cultural circles formed the "National Conference for the Restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations" as early as October 28 last year. With the support of 60 people's organizations, this conference launched a large-scale mass movement to hold a "Month for the Restoration of Japan-China and Japan-Soviet Diplomatic Relations" starting from the 20th of this month. The visit of the Japanese Diet delegation and the Japanese academic and cultural delegation to China, as well as the visit of the Chinese Red Cross delegation to Japan, and other mutual visits between Chinese and Japanese people's organizations, have aroused great attention in Japan and have been welcomed by the broad masses of the Japanese people. The Soviet government's proposal to hold negotiations to normalize Japan-Soviet relations has received a warm response among the Japanese people. At the request of the broad masses of the Japanese people, more and more political parties have put forward political programs such as "opposing the US Security Law aid, abolishing unequal treaties, and achieving complete independence," "opposing rearmament and conscription under the US-Japan Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement system," "adjusting diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union," "opposing the resolution of international tensions by force," and advocating "easing international tensions through consultation." The Japanese people's movement for independence and peace has increasingly formed a huge force.

However, the American aggressive bloc is unwilling to see Japan move towards the road of independence and peace. American government officials and soldiers have repeatedly issued blatant threats to Japan. When the Japanese people's call for the restoration of normal relations with the Soviet Union and China was rising, US Secretary of State Dulles hurriedly wrote a letter threatening the Japanese government, saying, "This makes one worry that the US government's aid plan to Japan will be obstructed." When the Japanese people launched a struggle against re-militarization, US Far East Commander-in-Chief Hull openly clamored that Japan should not be allowed to "maintain neutrality without strengthening its defense forces." Such blatant interference by the United States has hurt Japan's national self-esteem, and it is only natural that it has aroused the indignation of the Japanese people. However, under this pressure from the United States, which Japanese political parties truly respect the will of the people and adhere to the road of striving for independence and peace, and which political parties regard the demands of the people merely as campaign slogans, but in fact implement the American aggressive policy openly or covertly, this will be a serious test for each Japanese political party.

The Chinese people advocate establishing friendly relations with all countries with the same aspirations based on the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. Japan is China's neighbor. After the failure of Japanese militarism, the Chinese people hope that normal relations between China and Japan can be established quickly and develop towards peace and friendship. Premier Zhou Enlai pointed out at the First Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held in December last year: "Our country is willing to establish normal relations with Japan. If the Japanese government can also have the same desire and take corresponding measures , the Chinese government will prepare to take steps to normalize relations between China and Japan. The Chinese government advocates extensively developing trade relations with Japan according to the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and establishing close cultural ties with Japan." This is the unanimous wish of the Chinese people. For several years, the Chinese people and the Chinese government have also taken the initiative to take measures to solve problems related to trade, overseas Chinese, and war criminals with Japan.

Indeed, thanks to the efforts of the Chinese and Japanese people, Sino-Japanese relations have improved to some extent in the recent period. However, it must be emphasized that these improvements are far from meeting the expectations of the Chinese and Japanese people. At the same time, it must also be emphasized that because the Japanese government has not made efforts to improve the relations between the two countries, the efforts of the Chinese and Japanese people have encountered great limitations and obstacles. The Chinese people have noticed that people from many Japanese political parties, such as the Japanese Socialist Party of the left and right wings, advocate that the restoration of diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union should be realized quickly. Some other people have expressed a wavering attitude. They also said that they have the desire to establish normal Sino-Japanese relations, but under the pressure of the United States, they have put forward various so-called difficulties and adopted a passive attitude towards the issue of restoring normal Sino-Japanese relations. They said that China and Japan cannot immediately establish normal relations at present because the Japanese government recognizes the Taiwan government, and Japan's signing of a treaty with the Taiwan government was out of helplessness. Now Japan is still bound by this treaty. Therefore, to solve the problem with China, we can only wait for changes in the international situation. They even said that Japan will recognize "two Chinas." This is a pretext for willingly following the United States to evade its own responsibility. Taiwan is an inseparable territory of China, and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique that fled to Taiwan can never represent anyone. It is obviously absurd and an insult to the Chinese people to recognize a handful of remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which have long been spurned by the 600 million Chinese people, as the government representing China. It is even more intolerable for the Chinese people to follow the Western aggressive bloc and participate in the conspiracy to create "two Chinas." People who hold this idea seem to be different from Yoshida on the surface, but in fact they are still taking the old road of the Yoshida government, and this road is the road that isolates the Japanese government from the countries of Asia.

Similar situations also exist in the issue of developing trade between China and Japan. Although some people have expressed the hope to expand trade between China and Japan, they are unwilling to have the government take the responsibility that it should bear. They even mistakenly believe that China's advocacy of Sino-Japanese friendship must meet their one-sided demands, otherwise it seems that the Chinese side is unwilling to promote Sino-Japanese friendship. China has always advocated strengthening Sino-Japanese trade relations in all aspects, but the development of trade must be based on equality and mutual benefit. Allowing Sino-Japanese trade to stop at the current state, refusing to assume responsibility, and emphasizing one-sided demands can only hinder the further development of trade between the two countries.

The Chinese people have suffered from the long-term aggression of Japanese militarism, and the Chinese people cannot but pay close attention to the issue of preventing the revival of Japanese militarism. We have always advocated that an independent, peaceful, and democratic Japan can have self-defense armed forces. However, some Japanese people are attempting to massively rearm under the name of "self-defense" in order to revive Japanese militarism, which has nothing in common with our proposition. Because Japan is still under the semi-occupation of the United States today, the Japanese armed forces established under this circumstance cannot but become tools of American aggression. In fact, Japan has already dispatched officers to train troops for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, and provided instructors to train secret agents who are airdropped into China in the spy training classes that the United States opened in Japan for the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. Is this for "self-defense"? This policy of following the American aggressive bloc and carrying out rearmament is harmful and unprofitable to both the Chinese and Japanese people.

We believe that the various arguments that hinder the development of Sino-Japanese relations arise because some people in the Japanese ruling group have never been able to and dare not face up to the new situation that has occurred in Asia since World War II, and they cannot see the new changes that have occurred in the Japanese people. They are still stubbornly clinging to outdated views, fantasizing that Japan can retrace the old path that German fascists and Japanese militarists once took after World War I. Little do they know that their policy of following the United States can only make Japan's dependent status sink deeper and deeper, and inevitably lead to war, but not to independence.

To enable Japan to obtain true independence, and to enable the Japanese people to live a truly coexistent and prosperous life with the Asian people, it is necessary to get rid of the enslaved situation of the Japanese people today, and not to enslave others again. The Chinese people are still striving for their complete independence, so they also respect the Japanese people's desire for national independence. The Chinese people are striving for their prosperous and happy life, so they are also willing to see the Japanese people live a truly prosperous and happy life.

The Chinese and Japanese people bear a considerable responsibility for peace and security in the Far East. If China and Japan can establish friendly relations based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, it will not only benefit the Chinese and Japanese people, but also benefit the cause of world peace.

Therefore, for the common interests of the Chinese and Japanese people, and for the interests of world peace, the efforts made by the Japanese people on the road of striving for independence, peace, and democracy will surely receive the sympathy and support of the Chinese people.

### 日本人民面临着两条道路

    日本人民面临着两条道路
    日本即将举行大选，日本人民正面临着两条截然不同的道路。一条道路是争取独立和平的道路。这就是摆脱处于美国半占领下的状态、取得独立自主的地位、防止军国主义的复活、在维护亚洲和世界和平的事业中作出应有的贡献的道路。这是符合于吉田政府倒台后日本政治形势的总的趋向的。另一条道路是重走吉田政府的老路。这就是公开地或隐蔽地甘心作为美国的附庸、复活日本军国主义、日益陷入美国“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的侵略政策的泥坑、危害亚洲和世界和平的道路。这是和日本当前政治趋势背道而驰的。
    前一条道路是亚洲各国人民，尤其是中国人民所热烈欢迎的。日本人民在争取独立和平的道路上决不是孤立的。日益摆脱了殖民统治的桎梏的亚洲人民，特别是取得了自己的独立的中国人民深切地同情日本人民争取独立自主的努力。日本争取独立自主的努力不仅符合于日本人民的民族利益，而且是日本摆脱美国侵略政策和战争计划的必要条件，从而也是符合于和平的利益的。我们深信，日本人民将从自己身上找到足够的力量来克服前进道路上的困难。一切想阻挠日本人民前进、企图奴役日本人民的活动，是注定要失败的。
    但是，如果日本仍有人想重走吉田政府的老路，甘心与李承晚、蒋介石为伍，充当美国侵略政策的工具，那将是为美国火中取栗，将必然遭到亚洲广大人民首先是日本争取独立的人民的坚决反对。以前，日本军国主义者曾经妄想征服亚洲，在亚洲发动侵略，结果为日本招致了空前未有的灾难，遭到了悲惨的失败。更何况今天的亚洲已经不是过去的殖民地和半殖民地的亚洲了。中国六万万人民的胜利在亚洲产生了具有历史意义的变化。许多亚洲国家在推翻殖民统治中获得了重大的胜利和进展。强大的苏中两国人民和亚洲各国爱好和平的人民的力量，包括日本争取独立的人民的力量在内，决不容许日本重走军国主义侵略的老路。
    日本当前的政治趋势日益表明，日本的广大人民是要求走向独立和平的道路的。日本的广大人民和日本各党派中的有识之士都越来越认识到，追随美国侵略政策的道路将只能为日本招致无穷的灾难。他们要求摆脱日本对美国的依附地位，他们反对重新军国主义化，他们要求同中苏两国恢复正常关系并开展贸易和文化联系，他们要求与亚洲和世界各国和平共处。这些争取独立和平的呼声已经形成了日益广阔的运动。日本人民签名要求禁止原子武器和氢武器的人数截至一月十五日为止已经超过了二千二百万。日本政治、经济、文化界的著名人士早在去年十月二十八日就组成了“恢复日中、日苏邦交国民会议”。在六十个人民团体的支持下，这一会议发起从本月二十日开始举行“恢复日中、日苏邦交月”的广大的群众运动。日本国会议员代表团和日本学术文化代表团访问中国和中国红十字会代表团访问日本以及其他中日两国人民团体的相互访问，在日本引起了极大的重视，受到了日本广大人民的欢迎。苏联政府建议举行使日苏关系正常化的谈判在日本人民中获得了热烈的反应。在日本的广大人民的要求下，愈来愈多的党派提出了“反对美国安全法援助，废除不平等条约，达成完全独立”，“反对在美日共同防御援助协定体系下的重整军备和征兵制”，“和中苏两国调整邦交”，
  “反对以实力解决国际紧张局势”，主张“以协商缓和国际紧张局势”等等的政纲。日本人民要求独立和平的运动已经日益形成了一支巨大的力量。
    但是，美国侵略集团是不愿意看见日本走向独立和平的道路的。美国政府官员和军人一再对日本发出露骨的威胁。当日本人民要求恢复同苏联和中国的正常关系的呼声高涨的时候，美国国务卿杜勒斯就连忙写信威胁日本政府说，“这使人担心美国政府的对日援助计划会遭受阻碍”。当日本人民反对重新军国主义化的斗争开展的时候，美国驻远东军总司令赫尔就公开叫嚣，不准日本“维持中立而不去加强它的防御力量”。美国的这种露骨的干涉伤害了日本的民族自尊心，因而引起日本人民的愤慨是极其自然的。但是在美国的这种压力之下，究竟哪些日本政党真正尊重人民的意志，坚持争取独立和平的道路，哪些政党把人民的要求仅仅作为竞选的口号，而实际上却执行公开地或隐蔽地追随美国的侵略政策，这将是日本每个政党面临的严重考验。
    中国人民主张根据互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处五项原则，同一切具有同样愿望的国家建立友好关系。日本是中国的邻国，在日本军国主义失败后，中国人民希望中日两国的正常关系能够迅速地建立起来，并向着和平友好发展。周恩来总理在去年十二月召开的中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会第一次全体会议上，曾经指出：“我国是愿意同日本建立正常关系的。如果日本政府也能抱有同样的愿望，并采取相应的措施，中国政府将准备采取步骤，来使中国同日本的关系正常化。中国政府主张同日本按照平等互利的原则，广泛发展贸易关系，并同日本建立密切的文化联系。”这是中国人民一致的愿望。几年以来，中国人民和中国政府并曾主动地采取措施，同日本解决有关贸易、侨民、战犯等问题。
    诚然，由于中国和日本人民的努力，中日关系在最近一个时期以来是有了一些改进的。但是，必须着重指出，这些改进是远不能满足中日两国人民的期望的。同时，还必须着重指出，由于日本政府并未努力改进中日两个国家间的关系，中国和日本人民的努力已经碰到了很大的限制和障碍。中国人民注意到，不少日本政党的人士，例如日本左右派社会党就主张应该迅速实现恢复同中国和苏联的邦交。另有一些人士却表示了摇摆的态度。他们也说抱有建立中日正常关系的愿望，但是在美国的压力下，他们却又提出了种种的所谓困难，对于恢复中日正常关系的问题采取消极的态度。他们说，中日两国在目前是无法立刻建立正常关系的，因为日本政府承认了台湾政府，而日本和台湾政府签订和约是出于无奈。现在日本还继续受这一和约的约束，因此，要解决同中国的问题，只有等待国际形势发生变化。他们甚至说，日本将承认“两个中国”。这是甘心追随美国推诿自己责任的一种遁词。台湾是中国不可分割的领土，逃窜到台湾的蒋介石卖国集团绝不能代表任何人。承认一小撮早为六万万中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石卖国集团的残余分子为代表中国的政府，显然是荒谬的，是对中国人民的侮辱。追随西方侵略集团、参与制造“两个中国”的阴谋更是中国人民不能容忍的。抱着这种想法的人，表面上好像和吉田有所不同，其实他们走的仍然是吉田政府的老路，而这条道路则是使日本政府从亚洲各国中孤立起来的道路。
    在开展中日两国的贸易问题上，也存在着类似的情况。有些人虽然表示希望扩大中日两国间的贸易，但是却不愿意由政府出面承担应该担负的责任。他们甚至错误地以为中国主张中日友好就必须满足他们的片面要求，否则就好像是中国方面不愿意促进中日友好。中国是一向主张从各方面加强中日贸易关系的，但是贸易的开展必须建立在平等互利的基础上。让中日贸易停止在现有状况上，拒绝承担责任和强调片面要求的结果，只能是阻挠两国贸易进一步的开展。
    中国人民曾经遭受到日本军国主义长期的侵略，中国人民不能不密切注视防止日本军国主义复活的问题。我们一向主张一个独立、和平、民主的日本可以有自卫的武装。但是有些日本人士却企图假借“自卫”之名，在目前大规模地重新武装，以便复活日本军国主义，这与我们的主张是毫无共通之点的。因为日本今天还处在美国的半占领状态之下，在这种情况下建立起来的日本武装力量，不能不成为美国的侵略工具。事实上，目前日本就已经派遣军官为蒋介石卖国集团训练军队，并提供教官为美国在日本开设的蒋介石卖国集团的特务训练班训练空投到中国来的特务。这难道是为了“自卫”？这种追随美国侵略集团、进行重整军备的政策，对于中国人民和日本人民都是有害无利的。
    我们认为阻碍中日关系开展的各种说法之所以产生，是由于日本统治集团中有那么一部分人，他们始终不能也不敢正视第二次世界大战后在亚洲所发生的新的情况，他们也看不到在日本人民中所发生的新的变化。他们还是固执地抱着陈旧的看法，幻想日本可以重走第一次世界大战后德国法西斯和日本军国主义曾经走过的老路。殊不知他们这种追随美国的政策，只能使日本的附庸地位愈陷愈深，并不可避免地导向战争，而不可能走向独立。
    要使日本得到真正的独立，要使日本人民同亚洲人民一起过真正的共存共荣的生活，那就必须摆脱日本人民今天被奴役的境遇，而也不去重新奴役别人。中国人民仍在为自己的完全独立奋斗，因之也尊重日本人民的民族独立愿望，中国人民正在为自己的繁荣幸福的生活努力，因之也愿看到日本人民得过真正的繁荣幸福的生活。
    对于远东的和平和安全，中日两国人民负着相当大的责任。如果中日两国能够根据和平共处的五项原则，建立起友好关系，那将不仅有利于中日两国人民，而且有利于世界和平事业。
    因此，为着中日两国人民的共同利益，为着世界和平的利益，日本人民在争取独立、和平、民主的道路上所进行的努力，一定会获得中国人民的同情和支持。
