Families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary military personnel, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers in Gansu Province are actively engaged in labor and production, and their lives are going very well. According to statistics from 48 townships in 13 counties, including Jiuquan and Jingchuan, 64% of families of martyrs and military personnel participated in mutual aid and cooperation organizations last year, an increase of 12% compared to 1953. An Jiuzhen, a military family member from Hehao Village, Dengkou County, participated in the agricultural production cooperative. Last year, his family earned 580 workdays and received more than 11,320 jin of refined grains. In addition to improving their living standards, they also sold 2,266 jin of surplus grain to the state. He himself was recognized as a model military family member in the county.

Over the past year, the province has allocated more than 29 billion yuan for preferential treatment, helping families of martyrs and military personnel solve difficulties in production. According to preliminary statistics from 28 districts in 10 counties, including Gaotai, 2,738 families of martyrs and military personnel receiving subsidies purchased a total of 566 head of draught animals.

In cities, families of martyrs, military personnel, disabled revolutionary soldiers, and demobilized construction soldiers have participated in various sideline productions, and some have gone to work in industrial and mining enterprises. Last year, the Lanzhou Municipal People's Government introduced 134 family members of martyrs and military personnel to work in cooperative departments and industrial and mining enterprises. At the same time, it also organized families of martyrs and military personnel to build three tofu workshops, flour mills, five laundry bureaus, and laundry groups. In addition, all localities have provided regular in-kind subsidies to the elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and impoverished families of martyrs and military personnel who have no one to rely on.

    甘肃烈属军属生活过得很好
    甘肃省革命烈士家属、革命军人家属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人们积极劳动生产，生活都过得很好。据酒泉、泾川等十三个县四十八个乡的统计，去年烈属军属参加互助合作组织的占其总户数的百分之六十四，比一九五三年增加百分之十二。磴口县河濠村军属安九镇参加了农业生产合作社，去年全家得了五百八十个劳动日，分得细粮一万一千三百二十多斤，除改善生活外，还卖给国家二千二百六十六斤余粮。他本人被评为县的模范军属。
    一年来全省共拨发优抚事业费二百九十多亿元，扶助烈属军属解决了生产上的困难。据高台等十个县二十八个区的初步统计，享有补助费的二千七百三十八户烈属军属共买进耕畜五百六十六头。
    在城市的烈属、军属、革命残废军人和复员建设军人参加了各种副业生产，有的到工矿企业部门工作。兰州市人民政府去年介绍烈属军属到合作部门及工矿企业单位去工作的有一百三十四人。同时还组织烈属军属建成了三座豆腐坊、粉坊，五处洗衣局和洗衣小组。此外，各地对无依无靠的老、弱、孤、寡和贫苦的烈属军属，都给予了定期的实物补助。（新华社）
