    Weak Political Work Is the Root Cause of Chaos
    ——A Review of the People's Daily Criticism
    The Chinese Communist Party Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory Committee

    The criticism published in the People's Daily on January 18th, "The Product Quality of Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Factory Is Too Bad," is completely true and correct. The poor quality of our factory's products has not only caused huge economic losses to the country, but also political losses to the Party.

    The main root cause of the poor product quality of our factory is the weak political leadership of the Party Committee, which has lost its guaranteeing and supervisory role over the factory enterprises. Some cadres and Party members in our factory have been infected with bourgeois arrogance and complacency, but the Party Committee has turned a blind eye and rarely launched resolute and necessary struggles. This has allowed arrogance and complacency to erode the Party and cadres for a long time, especially among the leading cadres at the factory level, without being resolved early and continuing to spread.

    Because the Party Committee's leadership in political thought is weak, the political atmosphere in the factory is not strong. Workers generally have the idea of only asking about quantity and not quality, and the phenomenon of cadres being irresponsible and shirking responsibility is also quite serious. There has been long-term disunity among the cadres. The Party Committee's leadership over the various departments is also weak, and it is not good at strengthening the work of the departments from a political and ideological perspective, promoting the departments to face the workshops and adapt to the needs of the workshops.

    In the past, the Party Committee itself also blindly pursued quantity along with the administration, rarely concerning itself with quality. For example, the former Party Branch Secretary (now the Director of the Organization Department of the Party Committee), Jiang Xueli, when going to the workshop, even wanted to check the quality control personnel of the section, telling them "not to be excessive." Under the guidance of this kind of thinking, the situation in which the workshops only rushed for quantity and ignored quality during production can be imagined. Because the Party Committee failed to elevate the guarantee of product quality to an important position, it also prompted the Party branches to ignore quality. For example, some Party branch secretaries personally directed crash production, turning a blind eye to the behavior of cadres and workers cheating on quality. Some Party member foremen, in order to complete their tasks, helped their workmates cheat on quality and deceive inspectors. And some comrades in the technical inspection section also lacked a serious and responsible attitude towards national standards, adopting a "two-sided" approach (being able to get by both above and below). A saying prevalent among the inspection personnel was: "Rather make a false inspection than miss an inspection," meaning that missing an inspection would mean not getting the 20% bonus, and inefficient inspection did not affect production and was not their concern.

    Since the higher authorities made strict criticisms of our factory's poor product quality, the Party Committee, after studying the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session, checked and exposed the reasons for our factory's poor product quality. In the fourth quarter of last year, the entire factory carried out quality education from top to bottom, from inside the Party to outside the Party, from cadres to the masses, layer by layer unfolding quality inspection and ideological education. Through this education, the vast majority of cadres and workers realized the losses caused to the country by cheating on quality in the past and felt distressed. On this basis, necessary responsibility systems were established and improved, thereby laying an ideological foundation for improving product quality in the future. The Party Committee also made a resolution on improving product quality, deciding to do a good job of making up lessons for the trial manufacture of four new products and completely overhauling two old products, and ensuring that unqualified products do not leave the factory, laying an ideological and material foundation for improving product quality in the future.

    政治工作薄弱是造成混乱的根源
    ——对人民日报批评的检讨
    中共沈阳第二机床厂委员会
    一月十八日人民日报刊登的“沈阳第二机床厂的产品质量太坏了”这一批评，是完全真实的正确的。由于我厂产品质量低劣，不仅给国家造成了经济上的巨大损失，也给党造成了政治上的损失。
    我厂造成产品质量低劣的主要根源是党委的政治领导薄弱，失去对工厂企业的保证监督作用。我厂有的干部和党员沾染了资产阶级骄傲自满情绪，但党委却熟视无睹，很少展开坚决的和必要的斗争，这就使骄傲自满情绪长期的侵蚀到党内和干部中，特别是在厂一级领导干部中得不到及早的解决而继续蔓延下去。
    由于党委对政治思想领导不强，因而使全厂政治空气不浓，工人中普遍存在着只问产量不问质量的思想，干部之间工作不负责任，互相推诿的现象也相当严重。干部之间长期不团结。党委对各科室的领导也是薄弱的，不善于从政治思想上去加强科室工作，推动科室面向车间，适应车间的需要。
    党委本身过去也随着行政盲目追赶数量，很少去过问质量，如前任党总支书记（现任党委组织部长）姜学礼下车间时，竟要检查科命检查人员控制质量“不要过分”，在这种思想指导下，各车间在生产中光赶数量，不顾质量的情形，就可想而知。由于党委未能把保证产品质量提到重要地位，因而也促使党的支部忽视质量，如有的党支部书记亲自指导突击生产，看到干部与工人糊弄质量的行为置之不理，有的党员工长为了完成任务，帮助工友糊弄质量，蒙混检查人员。而技术检查科有些同志也缺乏对国家标准认真负责的态度，采取“两面光”的手法（对上对下都能过得去）。在检查人员中流行一种话：“宁愿错检不愿漏检”，就是说漏检了拿不到百分之二十的奖金，检查效率不高影响生产与己无关。
    自从上级对我厂产品质量低劣提出严格批评后，党委经过对四中全会决议的学习，检查揭发了我厂产品质量低劣的原因，在去年第四季度，全厂由上而下开展了质量教育，由党内到党外，由干部到群众，层层展开了质量检查和思想教育，通过这次教育，绝大部分干部与职工认识到了过去糊弄质量给国家造成的损失，并感觉痛心。在此基础上建立与健全了必要的责任制度，从而给今后改善产品质量，奠定了思想基础。党委还做了关于改善产品质量的决议，决定做好四种新产品试造补课，及两种老产品完全进行检修，并保证不合格的产品不出厂，给今后提高产品质量打下思想与物质基础。
