The organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition, 1955, No. 4, has been published.

This issue features an editorial entitled "Prevent the Threat of Atomic War!" The editorial points out that the World Peace Council's signature campaign against atomic weapons is unfolding amidst a complex international situation. The people are experiencing the most critical stage in their history. The people of the world can and must ban atomic weapons. Every honest person, every social organization should rise up against the threat of atomic war of destruction. The Communist and Workers' Parties believe that the struggle to win a bright future for their people is inseparable from the task of maintaining and consolidating peace. They will use all their strength to ensure the complete victory of this cause of the people.

This issue publishes the communique on the results of the implementation of the Soviet Union's 1954 national economic development plan and the publicity outline for the 50th anniversary of the First Russian Revolution.

Important articles published in this issue include "No Persecution of the German Communist Party" by O. Norman, Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Communist Party, "The Agricultural Crisis in Italy and the Struggle for Land Reform" by R. Greco, Member of the Central Steering Committee of the Italian Communist Party, and "The Hungarian People's Struggle for Peace and Demand for the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons" by A. Andics, Chairman of the Hungarian National Peace Council.

Norman's article points out that the trial of the German Communist Party was instigated by the American imperialists and conducted according to their methods. The German Communist Party believes that this is not only a threat to communists, but also a threat to all peace-loving patriots, especially workers and workers' organizations. The domestic and international struggle against this trial is inseparable from the struggle against the Paris military agreement and against the revival of German militarism. (Xinhua News Agency)

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    中文版一九五五年第四期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”一九五五年第四期中文版已经出版。
    这一期以“防止原子战争的威胁！”为题发表了社论。社论指出，世界和平理事会发动的反对原子武器的签名运动正在复杂的国际形势下展开。人民正在经历着自己历史上最紧要的阶段。世界人民能够而且必须禁止原子武器。每一个正直的人，每一个社会团体都应该起来反对原子毁灭战争的威胁。共产党和工人党认为，为本国人民争取美好的前途的斗争是和保持和巩固和平的任务分不开的。它们将用全部力量来保证人民的这个事业完全胜利。
    这一期刊载了苏联一九五四年发展国民经济国家计划执行结果的公报和第一次俄国革命五十周年宣传提纲。
    这一期发表的重要文章有德国共产党中央委员会书记处书记奥·诺曼的“不许迫害德国共产党”，意大利共产党中央指导处委员鲁·格雷科的“意大利的农业危机和争取土地改革的斗争”和匈牙利全国和平理事会主席艾·安迪奇的“匈牙利人民争取和平和要求禁止原子武器”等。
    诺曼的文章指出，审讯德国共产党是美帝国主义者指使而且按照他们的办法进行的。德国共产党认为这不仅是对共产党人的威胁，而且是对一切爱好和平的爱国人士首先是工人和工人组织的威胁。国内和国际上反对这次审讯的斗争，是和反对巴黎军事协定、反对复活德国军国主义的斗争分不开的。（新华社）
