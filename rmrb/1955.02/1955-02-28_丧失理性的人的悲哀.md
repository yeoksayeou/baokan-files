The U.S. Information Service recently told the world in an advertising tone that Dulles' foreign policy speech on February 16 showed that Dulles not only abandoned his old trick of "threatening or shouting in a bellicose tone" but also began to "appeal to reason" and adopt a "conciliatory attitude."

Obviously, even this mouthpiece of the U.S. State Department cannot help but feel that Dulles was originally a person who refused to "appeal to reason." That is why it believes that Dulles' ability to "appeal to reason" is a major event worthy of informing the world.

Of course, it would be a good thing for the United States or the world if the U.S. Secretary of State could regain his reason. However, after reading Dulles' speech on February 16, people found that the U.S. Information Service was running a false advertisement.

Where is there any sign of Dulles regaining his reason?

Who can say that insisting on using the military power of the United States to occupy Taiwan, which does not belong to the United States, is a non-belligerent and rational act? Dulles, on the pretext of "guaranteeing" that Taiwan would not be liberated by the Chinese people, announced that the American aggression would be further expanded to the coastal islands of China. Is this something that any rational or honorable person can say?

Dulles' loss of reason is particularly manifested in his speech in a passage about the Soviet Union. He said that only after a so-called "New Russia" appears, "may there be a basis for worthwhile negotiations and practical agreements between the United States and the New Russia."

From these words, it can be seen that Dulles is still openly advocating subversive activities against the Soviet Union. He has not even seen the strong unity of the Soviet people around the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and the great power of the Soviet defense forces and economic forces. He openly dreams of subverting the Soviet labor people's regime and restoring the so-called "New Russia" of capitalism in the Soviet Union. Dulles lives in a self-intoxicated fantasy, and he has not even a trace of a sense of reality.

However, Dulles is not a special example. Some American warmongers are like this. Because they have seen their historical doom, they are full of irreconcilable hatred and hatred for the people. Their futile struggle has made them lose their reason. Overthrowing the people's regimes of the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries is the task they have set for themselves. In order to achieve this goal, on the one hand, they are building military bases around the Soviet Union and China, carrying out war provocations, and actively preparing for war, and on the other hand, they are sending special agents and spies to carry out subversive and destructive activities. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson said in response to Congressman Goodhart on February 17, 1954, that the U.S. policy toward China is to "constantly maintain the threat of military action, in the hope that internal collapse will occur at some time." Dulles' speech shows that this is obviously the essence of these warmongers' policies toward the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

The reason why the U.S. Information Service wants to promote Dulles' "appeal to reason" and "conciliatory attitude" now is to put the responsibility for the current tense international situation on the Soviet Union and China, as if the Soviet Union and China are unwilling to adopt a "conciliatory attitude." But since Dulles has stated that only when the "New Russia" that the United States can appreciate appears, can there be negotiations and agreements between the United States and the so-called "New Russia," then it can be seen that he is refusing to negotiate with the Soviet Union. So, where is his so-called "conciliatory attitude"? Refusing to negotiate means not wanting to solve problems by peaceful means but wanting to solve them by war and subversion. This is exactly the attitude that Dulles has shown.

People have never heard the Soviet Union express its unwillingness to negotiate with the U.S. government. The Soviet government has always advocated resolving international disputes through peaceful consultation. Comparing the attitude of the Soviet Union with the attitude of the United States, it becomes clear that the root cause of the current tense international situation lies entirely in the American aggressive group's delusion to realize its ambition to dominate the world by war.

But, what makes Dulles and his ilk extremely sad is that it is not these irrational people who control the fate of mankind, but the broad masses of people who are full of confidence in their future and are prepared to carry the cause of defending peace to the end.

    丧失理性的人的悲哀
    蒋元椿
    美国新闻处最近用做广告的口吻告诉全世界说，杜勒斯在二月十六日发表的外交政策演说表明：杜勒斯不但放弃了他的“用好战的声调来进行威胁或叫喊”的老手段，而且开始“诉诸理性”，抱有“和解的态度”了。
    显然，甚至这个美国国务院的喉舌也不能不感到杜勒斯本来是个不肯“诉诸理性”的人。正因为如此，它才认为杜勒斯能够“诉诸理性”是一件值得通报全世界一体知晓的大事。
    当然，美国国务卿能够恢复理性，无论对美国或是全世界来说都会是件好事。然而人们在把杜勒斯二月十六日的演说读过一遍以后，却发现美国新闻处做的原来是假广告。
    哪里有什么杜勒斯恢复理性的迹象呢？
    谁能够说，坚持用美国的军事力量来侵占并不属于美国的台湾是一种不好战的有理性的行为呢？杜勒斯以“保证”台湾不被中国人民解放为理由，宣布要把美国的侵略进一步扩大到中国的沿海岛屿，这难道是任何有理性、有廉耻的人说得出来的话？
    杜勒斯的丧失理性特别表现在他演说中关于苏联的一段话。他说，只有在出现了一个所谓“新俄国”以后，才“可能有了在美国和新俄国之间进行值得的谈判和达成实际协议的基础”。
    从这些话可以看出：杜勒斯还是在公开鼓吹对苏联进行颠覆活动。他居然没有看到苏联人民在苏联共产党周围的坚强团结，和苏联国防力量和经济力量的巨大威力，公然梦想颠覆苏联劳动人民政权，使资本主义的所谓“新俄国”在苏联复辟。杜勒斯就这样生活在自我陶醉的空想之中，他连一丝一毫的现实感都没有了。
    但是，杜勒斯并不是一个特殊的例子。美国有些战争狂人都是这样的。他们由于看到了自己的历史的定局，对人民充满了不可调和的仇视和憎恨。他们的徒然的挣扎使他们丧失了理性。推翻苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的人民政权，这是他们给自己规定的任务。为了达到这个目的，他们一方面在苏联、中国的周围建立军事基地，进行战争挑衅，积极准备战争，另一方面派遣特务间谍进行颠覆和破坏活动。美国助理国务卿罗伯逊在一九五四年二月十七日答复众议员古达尔特的时候说，美国对中国的政策就是“不断保持着军事行动的威胁，以期到某一时候发生内部崩溃”。杜勒斯的演说表明：这显然也就是这些战争狂人对苏联和人民民主国家的政策的实质。
    美国新闻处之所以要在现在来宣传杜勒斯的
  “诉诸理性”和“和解态度”，本来是想把目前国际局势紧张的责任推在苏联和中国身上，好像苏联和中国不愿意采取“和解态度”。但是杜勒斯既然表示只有当美国所能赏识的“新俄国”出现时，美国和所谓“新俄国”之间才有谈判和达成协议的可能，那么，可见他是拒绝和苏联谈判的。这样，他的所谓“和解态度”究竟在哪里呢？拒绝谈判，就是不想用和平手段而想用战争和颠覆的手段来解决问题。杜勒斯所表明的态度也正就是这样。
    人们从来没有听到苏联表示过不愿意和美国政府谈判。苏联政府一贯主张通过和平协商来解决国际争端。拿苏联的态度和美国的态度相比较，就使人清楚地看到目前国际局势紧张的根本原因，完全在于美国侵略集团妄想用战争手段来实现它独霸世界的野心。
    但是，使杜勒斯之流极为悲哀的事情是：掌握人类命运的并不是他们这些丧失理性的人，而是对自己的前途充满信心，并准备将保卫和平的事业进行到底的广大人民。
