To the Editorial Staff:

    For a considerable period, a major problem in the production of the converter workshop of our Shanghai Iron and Steel Company No. 1 Factory has been the serious occurrence of molten steel leakage accidents. According to statistics from January 1st to 6th of this year alone, there were more than forty incidents of molten steel leakage, with a total loss of more than six tons of steel. The loss due to “shrinkage cavities” in steel ingots caused by leaking steel was as high as twenty-one tons. In these short six days, the equivalent of nine entire heats of steel were scrapped.

    Why have molten steel leakage accidents reached such a serious point? The main reason is the poor quality of the runner bricks supplied by the state-owned Shanghai Refractory Materials Factory. The iron oxide content in the runner bricks produced by this factory often exceeds the specified standard, and the iron oxide components are often concentrated in one area. Thus, when exposed to high temperatures, localized melting and even bursting and leakage of steel occur. Some runner bricks have air holes, and cracks are found before use. Some bricks are over-fired, while others are under-fired. The dimensional tolerances of some runner bricks are also inconsistent, some are too long, and some are too short, generally exceeding the standard by about two percent.

    The quality of the refractory bricks supplied by the Shanghai Refractory Materials Factory for lining the iron ladles is also very poor. According to the standard, a newly lined iron ladle can be filled forty to fifty times, but because the grain size of the brick clay produced by this factory is coarse, loose, and not firm, we can only fill each newly lined iron ladle twenty-five to thirty times. We often disrupt our work schedules and affect production because we do not have enough time to line new ladles. The product quality of the Shanghai Refractory Materials Factory has consistently been low. It is understood that in the twelve months of 1954, this factory failed to meet its product quality plan for eleven months.

    Our steel mill has a large demand for refractory bricks. We need to line new runner bricks for each heat of steel we produce. According to the 1955 plan, 90 percent of the refractory materials produced by the Shanghai Refractory Materials Factory will be supplied to our factory. Therefore, the quality of their products directly affects our production.

    Due to the continuous occurrence of serious molten steel leakage accidents, not only has the amount of waste increased and costs risen, but the quality of steel ingots has also been seriously affected. The steel ingots we produce may be used in railway tracks, or in the construction of various factories and large-scale bridges. If the quality is poor, it will inevitably affect the lifespan of the structures. The Shanghai Refractory Materials Factory must face the seriousness of this problem, take positive measures, and improve product quality.

### 上海耐火材料厂要认真提高产品质量

    上海耐火材料厂要认真提高产品质量编辑同志：
    较长时期以来，我们上海钢铁公司第一厂转炉车间在生产上存在的一大问题就是漏钢事故严重。仅据今年一月一日至六日的统计，发生漏钢事故即达四十多次，共计漏掉钢水六吨多。由于漏钢水而造成钢锭疵病“缩孔”损失即有二十一吨。在这短短的六天中，相当于九炉炼好的钢全部报废了。
    为什么漏钢事故达到这样严重的地步呢？主要原因是国营上海耐火材料厂所供给的浇道砖质量不好。这个厂出产的浇道砖中所含氧化铁往往都超过了所规定的标准，而且氧化铁的成份常常集中在一块；这样一遇到高温，就会发生局部熔化以致炸裂漏钢。有些浇道砖内有气孔，未经使用就发现裂纹，有的砖烧得太老，有的砖没有烧到火工。有些浇道砖的尺寸公差也不一致，有的嫌长，有的又太短，一般都要超过标准百分之二左右。
    上海耐火材料厂供给的砌盛铁桶用的耐火砖质量也很低劣，如按照标准，新砌一只盛铁桶，可装四十次到五十次，但因为这个厂生产的耐火砖砖土颗粒粗松，不结实，我们每新砌一次盛铁桶，只能装二十五次到三十次，我们常常因为来不及砌新桶，而打乱了作业计划，影响了生产。上海耐火材料厂的产品质量一直就是不高的，据了解，这个厂在一九五四年的十二个月内，就有十一个月没有完成产品质量计划。
    我们炼钢厂对耐火砖的需用量很大，我们每炼一炉钢就要新砌一炉浇道砖。根据一九五五年的计划，上海耐火材料厂所生产的耐火材料，将有百分之九十要供给我们的工厂，因此，他们的产品质量好坏直接影响到我们的生产。
    由于不断发生严重的漏钢事故，不仅增加了废品，提高了成本，而且严重地影响了钢锭的质量。我们炼出来的钢锭可能用在铁路轨道上，也可能用在建筑各式各样的工厂和规模巨大的桥梁上，如果质量不好，就必然影响到建筑物的寿命。上海耐火材料厂必须正视这个问题的严重性，采取积极措施，提高产品质量。
