    Wang Yunsheng
    By Our Reporter Tian Liu
    The Xizhanggeng Village Agricultural Production Cooperative promoted Qu Yaoli's cotton planting experience, and several hundred acres of cotton were managed as if they were made by a machine, neat and beautiful, each plant like a half-opened umbrella. In order to carry out the patriotic production increase movement, in June, the people's government mobilized farmers from several villages to visit these good cotton fields in Xizhanggeng Village. However, just entering July, nearly thirty acres of cotton became weaker day by day due to insufficient manure fertilizer; first the cotton leaves turned from green to yellow, then the cotton bolls that were flowering and fruiting began to fall off. The members and cadres were very anxious—anxious but there was no way to solve it. The cooperative had just been established and didn't have more money to buy fertilizer; even if there was money to buy, it was too late, and the cotton bolls would fall off before the fertilizer took effect. At this time, people anxiously discussed:
    "If only there was a way that was both cheap and quick!"
      "Where can we find such a good way?"
    One day, cooperative chairman Yang Shijun suggested, "Let the technical team leader Wang Yunsheng come up with a solution. If he doesn't know what to do, we have no other hope."
    Just as the chairman was about to look for Wang Yunsheng, he came smiling. Before Chairman Yang could speak, he said, "I've thought of a way to fertilize the cotton. Let's have a meeting to discuss it." People were very happy to hear that the technical team leader had come up with a solution. Not only the cadres, but also many members came to participate in the cooperative affairs meeting. However, as soon as people heard Wang Yunsheng's opinion, they burst into laughter:
      "What? Apply manure to the leaves? That's wonderful, never heard of it."
      "Even throwing a vote has to make a sound. Never heard of dissolving fertilizer in water and spraying it on the leaves."
    "Yunsheng wants to be a scientist. Manure is not applied to the ground, but sprayed on the leaves, haha, that's really rare."
      "Yunsheng, didn't you often tell us that the roots of crops are like people's mouths, for eating; and the leaves are like people's noses, for breathing? Why do you want to make them eat with their noses now?"
    Another burst of laughter. Someone jokingly said in a shrill voice:
  "Technical team leader, eat a meal with your nose first, and 'demonstrate' it for us!" 
    "Don't laugh yet, this isn't something I came up with myself," Wang Yunsheng said slowly, taking out a copy of "North China Agricultural Science Communication" from his pocket, pointing to an article on it and saying to everyone: "Look at it, it's written clearly on it, it's a Soviet experience, called root—ex—ter—nal—fertilization—method."
    The excited people slowly quieted down, looking at Yunsheng and that strange book in confusion. Don't believe it? The book clearly stated that it was a book published by the Academy of Sciences, and it was a Soviet experience, so how could it be wrong? Believe it? It's too mysterious, not to mention doing it, they've never even heard of it before. After a long period of discussion and debate, everyone finally decided to test it on three acres of land with an attitude of not being able to disbelieve it, and not being able to fully believe it, "If it works, then do more; if it doesn't work, the loss won't be great."
    The next morning, Wang Yunsheng began the experiment. He used two methods to experiment: one was to dissolve phosphate fertilizer in water and spray it on the branches and leaves of the cotton with a sprayer; the other was to grind phosphate fertilizer into very fine powder and spray it on the branches and leaves with a powder sprayer when there was dew in the morning. After finishing the work, Wang Yunsheng squatted on the edge of the field like he was bewitched, observing the changes in the cotton. Hour after hour passed, five hours passed, and it was noon, but there was still no change in these cotton leaves. "It's over!" he sighed deeply, walking home with a heavy heart. Just after taking a few steps back, he suddenly seemed to remember something, and suddenly turned around and walked back to the cotton field—he was not willing to accept his failure, he wanted to see if there was any change in the cotton? Just as he approached the cotton field, he saw a strange sight appear in the cotton field: the yellowed leaves turned green, as bright and beautiful as if they had just been washed by rain. Yunsheng jumped up with joy, gently and affectionately touching this leaf, and then touching that leaf, he felt that these emerald green leaves were more beautiful and attractive than any flower in the world.
      "Hey, Yunsheng is still good, he really has some skills." Praising words, like the doubting words at the beginning, poured in from all directions to Yunsheng. People happily encouraged: "Yunsheng, see if there are any other weak cotton plants in our cooperative, and spray them too."
    After inspection, another twenty-six acres of cotton were treated with foliar fertilization.
    In autumn, the effect of foliar fertilization was particularly significant. The cotton that had been foliar fertilized had an average of twenty-eight flower buds per plant, and only five fell off; the cotton that had not been fertilized only had twenty-five flower buds per plant, and seven fell off. For the foliar fertilized cotton, one hundred cotton bolls could yield one jin of cotton; for the non-fertilized cotton, it took one hundred and fifteen cotton bolls to yield one jin of cotton. The foliar fertilized cotton yielded five hundred and ninety-four jin of seed cotton per acre; the non-fertilized cotton only yielded three hundred jin. Farmers are practical people. The second year—1954, this new topdressing method spread in the area near Xizhanggeng Village. In Xizhanggeng Township, where Xizhanggeng Village is located, more than 600 acres of cotton fields were foliar fertilized.
    II. People who don't know the details would surely think that Wang Yunsheng is a technician sent to the village by the higher-level government; or that he is an intellectual who has attended some agricultural technical school and has now returned to his hometown. In fact, he is just an ordinary farmer. Four or five years ago, he even knew less about farming than ordinary farmers. Wang Yunsheng was born thirty-seven years ago in a middle-peasant family. Although his family's life was not very wealthy, he was pampered from an early age. His father believed that "any profession is better than farming," and he was determined not to let his only son be a farmer for the rest of his life. When Yunsheng was about ten years old, his father sent him to the village elementary school to study. Five or six years later, he sent him to work as an apprentice in a small grocery store in the county town. But Yunsheng's father's dream did not come true. In 1937, the Japanese occupied Jieyu County, and Yunsheng fled back to his hometown. Because the Japanese often came to the village to arrest, kill, and burn houses, his hometown was not a place to live, so Yunsheng ran to the Yuncheng Railway Station to work as a porter. Being a porter under the Japanese occupation was very hard. In order to forget the unbearable shame, Yunsheng, like other coolies, began to gamble and drink...to numb himself. In 1945, the Japanese surrendered, and he returned home. As soon as he arrived home, he was drafted into the army by Yan Xishan. It was not until Yan Xishan's bandit army was defeated by the People's Liberation Army in 1947 that he was liberated. This is Wang Yunsheng's experience. He had never properly farmed since he was a child, so where would he have any production experience! Strangely enough, in 1950, people elected him as the village's production committee member. At that time, people elected him not because he understood production or was better than others. The only reason they elected him was because he was very active during the land reform in 1949—in fact, not only was he active in the land reform, but he was also very active in all the work he did after he was liberated and returned to the village in 1947. He often said, "People who have eaten bitter melon know the taste of sugar better; people who have personally suffered from the Japanese bandits and Yan bandits understand the happiness of liberation better." Therefore, he regarded the Party and the People's Government as his reborn parents, and he absolutely supported and trusted the Party and the People's Government. He took the lead in responding to all the calls of the Party and the People's Government without any discount. When the Party led the peasants to carry out land reform in 1949, he didn't worry about the future like some people, and he was afraid to stand out, so he took care of everything before and after. Because of this, people elected him as the production committee member. As for whether he had production experience or could lead production, people didn't care—at that time, people didn't even think of asking him to lead production, people said: Our ancestors have been farming for generations, do we still need leadership?
    At first, people elected Yunsheng as the production committee member, and they didn't think it was a big deal. Who knew that just after the Spring Festival, he was urging people to send manure and transport soil: it became even more troublesome later: deep plowing, seed selection, he was urging people all day long; people slowly became impatient. Some people deliberately made things difficult for him. They knew he didn't understand production, but they deliberately raised a lot of questions to stump him, wanting to use this method to stop him from urging them and giving them trouble. At one point, as soon as people saw Yunsheng walking towards them, before he could speak, they would ask, "Yunsheng, you keep saying to do deep plowing, what are the benefits of it?" "I think field seed selection is not as good as seed selection in the field. In the field, the wheat ears are shaken by the wind, how can you see the good or bad ones?"
    Who knew why deep plowing was necessary? As for field seed selection, Yunsheng thought that it was indeed not as convenient as field seed selection. However, he couldn't express his attitude, so he said with a red face, "The superiors are calling for it, it must be right. Just do as they say, it's not wrong."
    People laughed when they heard it. Those older farmers taught him, "Yunsheng, you're not good at farming. I've done more farming than you've ever seen!" Those naughty young people were not as kind as the old people, and they often mocked him:
    "Production committee member, why doesn't my mule have any foals? Come and guide us, let it have a foal!"
    The superiors were urging tightly, and the masses didn't listen—and they were laughing at him, Yunsheng was very sad, and sometimes he got angry, and he said to himself fiercely:
  "Tomorrow I will go to the district and say, I can do anything, I will never be this angry committee member again." But he didn't go the next day—why? He himself couldn't explain clearly, anyway, he felt that there was something wrong with doing that. While Yunsheng was distressed, the county farm opened an agricultural technology training class, and Yunsheng was asked to attend. This was in the spring of 1951. This spring became the spring of Yunsheng's life. Although the training class only lasted for eleven days, he felt that he had learned more knowledge than he had in five or six years of school. He not only understood a lot of basic agricultural technical common sense, but more importantly, he understood a truth: if you don't know, learn, and you will know when you learn. After returning from the training class, he bought a lot of agricultural science pamphlets, such as "Popular Science Knowledge Pictures", "Small Series of Science and Technology", "Small Series of Agricultural Production", and so on. During the day, he worked hard; at night, when he returned home, he stayed up half the night reading and studying. His wife didn't know how many times she had argued with him about reading at night—what was the use of arguing! You argue yours, I read mine. His wife had no choice, so she complained to the neighbors:
      "He's obsessed with something, and he has to get to the bottom of it. He's reading again tonight. He reads for most of the night, and doesn't let others sleep peacefully. He's tired during the day, and he stays up late at night, how can he not be sleepy? He's made mistakes twice, and almost burned our mother and daughter to death. He fell asleep while reading, and knocked the book onto the lamp, and it caught fire all at once. I was so anxious that I didn't even bother to put on my clothes, and I knocked the book to the ground and put it out with water. I was so angry that I punched him twice, but as soon as he opened his eyes, he asked: 'Where's my book?' He thought I had hidden his book again. I said angrily: 'Your book has gone to heaven, go find it!'"
    Yunsheng studied "half the night", at first, just to avoid being stumped and ridiculed. When he got started, the book brought him a kind of joy, happiness and satisfaction that he had never experienced before. The book showed him a new world that was infinitely rich and infinitely wonderful. Now, he not only went to the book to find answers when he encountered difficulties in his work; but he also pursued knowledge eagerly. He began to study more systematically, such as "Dryland Cotton Farming", "Seed Science", "Principles of Crop Cultivation" and Michurin's "Superior Seed Genetics", etc., all of which were his favorite reading materials. Now, learning has become a part of his life, a hobby and habit of his. In this hard and continuous study, his agricultural technical knowledge became richer day by day: when it was almost time for sowing, he would tell people how to carry out drug seed mixing; how to carry out seed vernalization; if the sprayer was broken, he would repair it; if there was a lack of fertilizer, he would teach people how to make high-temperature quick-acting compost... Anyway, from plowing and sowing, pest control to field management of various crops; from raising chickens and pigs to raising bees; from planting crops to gardening... He knew everything about what farmers did for a living; otherwise, why would everyone in the village elect him as the technical team leader of the cooperative when the agricultural production cooperative was established in 1953? Why, after the agricultural cooperative developed greatly in 1954, and all six villages in the township established agricultural cooperatives, and more than 96% of the farmers joined the cooperatives, and in order to guide the work of the various village cooperatives, the entire township established a joint cooperative of agricultural cooperatives, and they elected him as the technical team leader of the joint cooperative again?
  III. Yunsheng is a studious person, he not only learns from books, but also learns from the advanced experiences of other places. He has very close ties with the county farm, the Yuncheng farm, the tractor station, and the technology promotion station. Many of his agricultural science knowledge came from these places. The wheat yield of Xizhanggeng Village has increased year by year, mainly due to the promotion of the farm's advanced experience.
    Speaking of the increase in wheat production, there is a tortuous and moving experience in it.
    As early as 1951, Yunsheng was trained at the farm and learned the principle of
  "Mother Strong, Son Fat", and he returned to promote it to the people. But people didn't believe him, and instead said, "As long as the land is well cultivated, any seed can produce more grain." There was no way, he had to experiment on his own land first, planting sixteen kinds of wheat on one acre of land. The same land, the same fertilizer, the same cultivation, but the harvest of the sixteen kinds of wheat was different.
  "Bima No. 1" wheat had the highest yield, and three ridges yielded more than thirty jin;
  "No. 60" wheat was the second, yielding twenty-eight jin; "Black Character" wheat was not good, yielding only eleven jin. Only then did people believe what Yunsheng said, "Adopting good varieties is one of the important conditions for increasing production." The following year, "Bima No. 1" and other four good varieties were promoted in the whole village. Also that year, Yunsheng promoted the principle of dense planting to increase production to the masses, and changed the nine-inch row spacing of the planter to seven inches. Therefore, in 1953, Xizhanggeng Village achieved an unprecedented wheat harvest. The average yield of wheat per acre reached one hundred and forty-five jin. That year, when he was harvesting wheat, he saw wheat with a dense planting row spacing of four and a half inches at the Yuncheng Farm, and it grew as lush as the seven-inch row spacing in their village, so he wanted to change the wheat in his village to four and a half inches. At night, when he was reading at home, he saw that the row spacing of wheat in the Soviet Union was only two and a half inches, which further strengthened his confidence. He was confident that the wheat row spacing had changed from nine inches to seven inches the previous year and had a bumper harvest, and now that it had changed from seven inches to four and a half inches, everyone would definitely agree with both hands. Actually, it was not so. When the members and cadres heard Yunsheng's opinion, not only did they not agree with both hands, but they also firmly opposed it. People said:
    "No matter what you do, there must be a limit. The row spacing changed from nine inches to seven inches last year, and this year it will be changed to four and a half inches. How many inches will it be changed to next year?"
    Yunsheng then used the fact that the wheat row spacing in the Soviet Union was two and a half inches, and one acre could yield more than a thousand jin to explain to everyone, but people said:
    "This is not the Soviet Union. They use tractors, and we use old cattle; they use chemical fertilizers, and we use human manure, pig manure, and plant ash. Their land is good, they have a lot of fertilizer, and they use machines to farm. How can we compare with them?"
    "The Yuncheng Farm is only thirty miles away from our village, isn't it the Soviet Union," Yunsheng argued, "Their row spacing is also four and a half inches." "What kind of land grows what kind of crops. The soil of the Yuncheng Farm is good."
    Yunsheng further explained to everyone by using the fact that in previous years, when planting wheat, there was always a little seed left over, and it was not worth taking it back, so he planted a few rows horizontally at the edge of the field, and it grew the same well the following year.
    "That's different," people retorted, "The edge of the field is ventilated and has enough sunlight. If it is planted so densely inside, it will definitely get smut."
    "Then," Yunsheng said helplessly, "Plant a few acres less to experiment."
      "No need to experiment," people still opposed, "Knowing it won't work, why experiment!"
    Left explanation and right explanation, no matter what, everyone disagreed. Yunsheng's patience disappeared, he raised his arms, and said angrily:
    "Chairman, give me back my land; you don't do it! I'll do it myself!"
   People had long seen Yunsheng's lips trembling—his lips would tremble when he was anxious, but they didn't expect him to say such a thing, and everyone was stunned. Chairman Yang Shijun asked him in surprise:
    "What, give you back the land, do you want to withdraw from the cooperative? Don't you want to take the socialist road?"
      "You don't let people take it!"
    "Yunsheng, don't say that," Yang Shijun said to him gently,
  "Who can stop you from taking it?"
    "Don't think that you can get to socialism by establishing a cooperative," Yunsheng said gruffly, "If you don't do things according to socialist principles, don't adopt new technologies, and don't greatly increase production, you still won't get to socialism."
    After Yunsheng calmed down a little, he said again:
    "The members of our cooperative don't have any private plots of land. If there were private plots of land, you wouldn't believe it, I would plant them on my own land for you to see; now the cooperative doesn't experiment, do you still want me to mobilize individual households to experiment and set an example for the cooperative?!"
    People didn't know what to say. Everyone looked at me, I looked at you, and couldn't find any words to refute him.
    "Give me back the land, I'll go experiment," Yunsheng continued, "If the experiment is successful, it will be the cooperative's; if it fails, it will be my own."
    At this point, people had nothing more to say, so they had to allocate eight acres of land for him to experiment—and they were afraid that his experiment would not succeed, so they did not allocate good land to him, but only allocated him eight acres of cotton stubble land. "Cotton stubble land is cotton stubble land," Yunsheng thought, "No matter what kind of land you experiment on, it will show a high or low result." On that three-acre plot, he planted two acres using a six-inch row spacing planter, changing the row spacing to three inches, and left
  one acre of "control field", still sowing according to a six-inch row spacing; on that five-acre plot, he cross-sowed four acres using a six-inch planter, and also left one acre as a control. When people saw it, they laughed: "The increase in wheat production in the cooperative next year will depend on these two plots." "You laugh," Yunsheng said in his heart, "You won't laugh when my experiment is successful." Sure enough, as expected, when the wheat was harvested the following year, three kinds of sowing methods yielded three kinds of yields: the six-inch row spacing had the lowest yield, the cross-sowing had a yield that was 40% higher than it; the six-inch planter that was planted into a three-inch row spacing had a yield that was more than 60% higher than the six-inch row spacing. In the face of the facts, people believed it. In 1954, the People's Government established a machine tractor station in Xizhanggeng Township. In the autumn, when sowing wheat, the comrades at the tractor station said to them, "To use a tractor to plant wheat, you must plant it densely to a four-and-a-half-inch row spacing." The members said without any hesitation, "Sow it, our technical team leader experimented with it on the stubble land plowed by cattle the year before, and a three-inch row spacing can also increase production. Now there is no problem planting a four-and-a-half-inch row spacing on the land deeply plowed by a tractor."
    IV. Two years ago, Yunsheng believed that new technologies were not easy to promote thoroughly, and that there was an organizational fault. A family only had ten or eight acres of land, and they didn't dare to adopt new technologies rashly. "What if it doesn't work?" he often heard when promoting new technologies, "Wouldn't a family's livelihood be ruined?" Therefore, when the county party committee proposed that they establish an agricultural production cooperative in the winter of 1952, Yunsheng welcomed the establishment of the cooperative like welcoming a happy event. He mobilized this family and persuaded that family, asking people to participate in the agricultural production cooperative.
    After the establishment of the agricultural production cooperative, the land was unifiedly managed, people worked collectively, and it was indeed much easier to promote new technologies than in the past. But it was not what Yunsheng originally thought: "After the establishment of the cooperative, there will be no difficulty in promoting new technologies." Although there was no conservative thinking of small private owners in the cooperative like individual farmers, there was another kind of conservative thinking—a kind of conservative thinking that arose because the members did not understand technology and because they had "never heard of it before". Besides, the cooperative promoted new technologies, unlike individual farmers who only did it on small plots of land; the cooperative either didn't do it, or it did it on a large area. Implementing new technologies on a large area requires a lot of people who can master the new technologies. But the members didn't have the technology and didn't know how to do it, so even if the cooperative decided to promote new technologies, it still couldn't be implemented. Just take the matter of the cooperative's plan to apply granular fertilizer to the cotton fields once in the summer of the first year of the cooperative's establishment: the plan was originally well planned, but it just so happened that when it was time to fertilize, more than 180 acres of cotton were infested with aphids. Preparing insecticide solution and repairing the medicine machines were all Yunsheng's responsibility, and he was so busy that he couldn't even eat, so how could he have time to make granular fertilizer? Asking others to make it, they didn't know how to, so they had to not apply it, and the good plan fell through. Since the promotion of foliar fertilization of cotton and dense planting of wheat was hindered by conservative thinking; since the plan to apply granular fertilizer to the cotton fields fell through; Yunsheng realized that in the cooperative, the new technologies could be better promoted and implemented only if the members all understood the new technologies, mastered the new technologies, and knew how to do them. After these few things, Yunsheng further improved his working methods. He not only persuaded everyone to adopt new technologies as in the past, but also taught the members on the ground how to master the new technologies. He used the time during field breaks to explain new technologies to the members, and also seized various facts during labor to spread new experiences to the members. At the beginning of 1954, the Xizhanggeng Village Agricultural Production Cooperative had greatly developed again, and all the farmers in the village, except for the few landlords and rich peasants, had joined the cooperative. He thought: The number of new members has increased, and the technology should be improved before the spring plowing to ensure increased production. Coincidentally, at this time, the female vice-chairman Yao Fenglan also noticed this problem, and also wanted to organize the female members to learn technology, so they reflected this opinion to the branch. The branch enthusiastically supported their opinion and decided to mobilize the members to actively learn agricultural technology. As a result, a technology learning group was established. More than a dozen young activists, including female vice-chairman Yao Fenglan, participated in the technology learning group. Wang Yunsheng patiently taught them how to mix insecticide solution, how to repair medicine machines, how to make granular fertilizer.... At this time, several young students returned from school, and as soon as they arrived in the village, they found their role models, and they all decided to learn from Yunsheng, and they all joined the technology group. Yunsheng also felt that these students were a good force for spreading new technologies in the future, and he taught them more carefully. Junior high school student Wang Ziquan had just returned to the village and didn't understand any technology, but now he has learned how to prepare "E605" insecticide, apply "666" powder, use powder sprayers and sprayers, make granular fertilizer, Qu Yaoli's cotton field management experience... These young students not only learned technology from Yunsheng, but also learned his work spirit. After they learned, they went to teach the members. In May, several comrades from the Central Academy of Sciences came to the village to do experimental work and were willing to help them teach classes. Wang Yunsheng and Yao Fenglan thought it was a good opportunity, so they actively mobilized the members to participate in the study, and the technology learning group expanded to more than 20 people. Soon, the young people in other villages in the township also asked to participate in the study, so the technology learning group in Xizhanggeng Village expanded into a technology night school for the whole township, and the number of students increased to more than 80. Yunsheng deeply realized in the work of promoting new technologies: "Hearing is not as good as seeing, seeing is not as good as doing it yourself." Therefore, they adopted the teaching method of "less speaking, clear speaking, thorough speaking, more discussion, learning what you do in the field in the classroom, learning and using" in teaching, and the students had a very high learning enthusiasm and made rapid progress. From the time it was opened last May until now, the students have mostly learned seed selection, seed soaking, thinning, and all cotton field management techniques. These students are students in the technology night school at night, and they become teachers in the production team during the day; they teach the technologies they have learned to the members who have not participated in the technology night school. In Xizhanggeng Village alone, there are 54 male members and 67 female members who have learned cotton pruning, fertilization, and the use of sprayers to control insects, etc., 12 members have learned to master powder sprayers, 9 people have learned to make granular fertilizer, 6 people have learned to prepare "E605" insecticide powder.... Because they cultivated a technical force, they were able to harvest wheat and control insects without any delay in the summer, ensuring a bumper harvest of cotton and wheat.
    Last June, the wheat ripened. What good wheat, the wheat ears were as thick as fingers, and with a little breeze, the wheat ears were squeezed and crackled. However, at this time, cotton aphids occurred. Cotton and wheat are the main crops of the Xizhanggeng Village Agricultural Production Cooperative. Of the 1,700 acres of land in the entire cooperative, there were more than 800 acres of wheat and 700 acres of cotton. If the wheat is not harvested immediately, it will be overripe, causing a "falling scythe" loss; if the cotton aphids are not controlled immediately, the cotton will have a poor harvest. Whether it is delaying the wheat harvest or delaying insect control, it will cause great losses to the cooperative. In the past, you would either miss the wheat harvest or miss insect control. But now, because the members have learned insect control technology, they mainly used male members and sent more than 30 strong female members to participate in the wheat harvest; the other 40-odd female members with weaker bodies went to control insects. Two things were done at the same time, and nothing was delayed, ensuring a bumper harvest of cotton and wheat. The wheat yielded 194 jin per acre, an increase of 49 jin compared with 1953, and the cotton yielded more than 282 jin per acre, an increase of 61 jin compared with 1953.
    In the labor competition that did not delay both wheat harvesting and insect control, Yunsheng was responsible for leading insect control. At that time, it was the hottest season, and the work was heavy, and people were very tired. Whether it was those who harvested wheat or those who controlled insects, when they rested at noon, they would eat some food randomly, quickly lie down in the shade, and fall asleep immediately. Yunsheng's body has always been thin, and he not only had to control insects like others, but also had to pay attention to other people's work at all times, to see if the medicine was sprayed in the right place according to the technical requirements? Whether the medicine was wasted? Therefore, by noon, not only were his arms sore, but his voice was also hoarse. He really wanted to sleep in the shade like others, but his impatient temper made him unwilling to rest, and he always used the noon rest time to repair the sprayers that had problems. The members looked at his exhausted appearance, and were afraid that he would be exhausted, so they often persuaded him to rest. But he said:
    "Insect control should be done early to be controlled. Look how fast those aphids grow in this hot weather!"
    Don't look at Wang Yunsheng working so seriously and tirelessly, he doesn't care much about his own affairs. Other members and cadres work for a day, and they always want the cooperative to remember the work points for the day clearly, and some even inquire about how many points they can earn before working, and always pick the work that is both easy and earns more labor days. Yunsheng is not like that, he has never cared about the lightness or heaviness of the work, or the number of labor days. During the wheat harvest, others rest at noon, he repairs sprayers, and he has never asked the cooperative to record his work points. In the past few years, he has spent more than 1.3 million yuan on books to improve the cooperative's production and promote new agricultural science and technology, and he has never said "This is for the production of our cooperative, and the cooperative should pay for it." He always uses his own money to buy it.... Because he doesn't pay attention to these things, and because the cooperative has no experience, when the accounts were settled at the end of the first year of the cooperative's establishment in 1953, Yunsheng got the least labor days. The members said:
    "Yunsheng has never done any work for his own family, and he has been busy for our cooperative's affairs, which is unfair."
    "Yunsheng has played a big role in the annual improvement of our cooperative's production." Branch secretary and cooperative instructor Zhang Liqiu said: "He himself doesn't care about personal interests, I propose that his labor days be calculated according to the cooperative's highest standard in the future." No one opposed the branch secretary's proposal, and it was unanimously passed. Someone once asked Yunsheng why he didn't pay attention to his own interests at all?
    "How can I not pay attention, isn't my life much better than before liberation?" he replied, "Now, what we are doing is socialist work, and socialism will go further to communism. In a communist society, everyone takes what they need, and then our lives will be even better."

  一西张耿村农业生产合作社推广了曲耀离的植棉经验，几百亩棉花，侍弄的就像机器造出来似的，又整齐又好看，一棵棵跟半撑开的雨伞一般。为了开展爱国增产运动，六月间人民政府动员了好些村庄的农民，到西张耿村参观这些好棉花。可是，刚进七月，有近三十亩棉花因为粪肥不足，一天天衰弱下来了；先是棉叶由绿变黄，接着是开花结桃的棉铃开始脱落。社员和干部们都很着急——着急也没有办法。社刚成立，没有更多的钱买肥料；就是有钱买，时间也来不及了，等不到肥料使上劲，棉铃早脱落了。这时候，人们都焦急地谈论着：
    “要是能有个又省钱，又见效快的办法就好了。”
      “到哪儿找这个好办法呢？”
    一天，社长杨士俊提议说：“让技术股长王运升给想法解决吧，要是他也不知道该怎么办，咱们就再没别的指望了。”
    社长刚要去找王运升，他笑嘻嘻地来了。没等杨社长开口，他就先说道：“我想了个给棉花施肥的办法，咱们开会研究研究吧。”人们听说技术股长想出了办法，都很高兴。不光干部们，连社员们也有好些来参加社务会了。可是，人们刚听完王运升的意见，就哄的一声大笑起来：
      “什么？把粪施在叶子上？真妙，听也没听说过。”
      “扔票也得扔出个响声来，开天辟地也没听说过把肥料化成水往叶子上喷。”
    “运升要当科学家啦，粪不往地里施，要往叶子上喷，哈哈，真稀罕。”
      “运升，你不是常给我们说，庄稼的根就像人的嘴，是吃饭的；叶子就像人的鼻子，是出气的吗？怎么，又要叫它用鼻子吃饭呢？”
    又是一阵哄笑。不知谁尖着嗓子开玩笑道：
  “技术股长先用鼻子吃个饭，给我们‘示范’一下吧！” 
    “你们先别笑，这也不是我个人瞎钻出来的，”王运升慢慢说着，从口袋里拿出一本“华北农业科学通讯”，指着上面的一篇文章向大家说：“看看吧，这上面写得清清楚楚，苏联的经验，叫作根——外——施——肥——法。”
    激动的人们慢慢安静下来了，迷惑地望着运升，望着那本奇异的书。不信吧，书上明明白白写着，是科学院出的书，又是苏联经验，还会有错？信吧，这太玄妙了，别说作过，连听说还是头一回呢。经过很长时间的讨论、争辩，最后大家抱着不能不信，不能全信的态度，决定在三亩地里先试验一下，“成了，再多作；不行，损失也不大。”
    第二天早晨，王运升便开始试验了。他是用两个方法试验的：一个是先把磷肥化成水，用喷雾器喷在棉花的枝叶上；一个是把磷肥轧成很细很细的粉末，趁着早晨有露水的时候，用喷粉器喷在枝叶上。作完以后，王运升像着了魔似的蹲在地边，观察着棉花的变化。时间一点钟又一点钟地过去了，五个钟头过去了，天气晌午了，但总不见这些棉叶有什么变化。“完了！”他深深地叹了口气，心情沉重地往家里走去。刚刚往回走了几步，他像突然想起了什么，猛地扭转身来，又走回棉田——他不甘心自己的失败，他要再看一看棉花有无变化？刚刚走近棉田的时候，他看见一种奇异的景象在棉田里出现了：发黄了的叶子变绿了，就像刚刚被雨水淋洗过的一样鲜艳、挺秀。运升高兴得跳起来了，他轻轻地爱抚地摸摸这个叶子，又去摸摸那个叶子，他觉得这些翠绿的叶子，比世上任何鲜花都要美丽，都要诱人。
      “嗬，还是运升行，真有两下。”赞美的言辞，就像当初怀疑的语句一样，从四面八方向运升涌来。人们欢欣地鼓励着：“运升，看看咱们社还有哪些棉花弱，也给它们打打。”
    经过检查，又给二十六亩棉花做了根外施肥。
    到秋天，根外施肥的效果就格外显著了。做了根外施肥的棉花，每棵平均长二十八个花蕾，只脱落五个；没做的一棵棉花只长二十五个花蕾，倒脱落七个。做了根外施肥的，一百个棉桃，能摘一斤花；没做的要一百一十五个棉桃，才能摘一斤花。做了根外施肥的，一亩地收五百九十四斤籽花；没作的只收三百斤。农民是讲求实际的人。第二年——一九五四年，这个新的追肥方法，便在西张耿村附近一带传播开了。仅仅西张耿村所在的西张耿乡，进行根外施肥的棉田，就达六百多亩。
    二不知道底细的人，准以为王运升是上级政府派到村里的一个技术人员；或者以为他是上过什么农业技术学校，如今回到了家乡的知识分子。其实，他只是一个普通的农民，四、五年前，他甚至于还不如普通的农民对种庄稼的事更懂得多些。王运升三十七年前出生在一个中农的家里。他的家庭，生活虽不大宽绰，从小倒也娇生惯养。他的父亲认为“不论哪一行也比种地强”，决心不让自己的独生子再当一辈子庄稼汉。运升十来岁时，父亲就送他到本村小学里去念书。五六年后，又送他到县城里一家小杂货店里去作学徒。但运升父亲的梦想没有实现。一九三七年日本人占领了解虞县城，运升逃回到自己的家乡。因为日寇常到村里来抓人、杀人、烧房子，家乡也没法住，运升又跑到运城车站当搬运工人。在日寇占领下当搬运工人，是很苦的。为了忘却那难忍难耐的耻辱，运升也像别的苦力工人一样，开始赌博、酗酒……来麻醉自己。一九四五年日寇投降，他回到家里，刚到家就被阎锡山抓了壮丁，直到一九四七年阎锡山的匪军被解放军打垮后，才被解放出来。这就是王运升的经历。从小就没正南靠北地种过庄稼，哪里会有什么生产经验！说起来是怪事，一九五○年人们偏偏选举他当村里的生产委员。当时，人们选他，并不是因为他懂得生产，比别人高明。选他的唯一原因就是因为他在一九四九年土地改革的时候挺积极——其实，不光土地改革中积极，从一九四七年他被解放回到村里以后，做什么工作都很积极。他常说：“吃过黄连的人，更知道糖的滋味；亲身受过日寇、阎匪折磨的人，更懂得解放的幸福。”因此，他把党和人民政府视同再生父母，对党和人民政府绝对拥护，绝对信任。党和人民政府的一切号召，他都带头响应，不打折扣。一九四九年党领导农民进行土地改革的时候，他不像有些人顾前顾后地怕出头，凡事跑前跑后地张罗。就为这，人们选他当了生产委员。至于他有没有生产经验，能不能领导生产，人们是不介意的——那时候人们根本就没有想叫他领导生产，人们说：祖祖辈辈就种庄稼，还用领导？
    起初，人们选运升当生产委员，本来觉着不算一回什么事情。谁知刚过了春节，他就催着人送粪、运土：往后就更麻烦了：什么深耕啦，选种啦，成天地跟在人屁股后头催；人们慢慢地不耐烦起来。有些人就故意跟他为难。明明知道他不懂生产，偏要提出很多问题来难他，想用这个办法，使他不再督促他们，不再给他们找麻烦。有一个时候，人们只要见运升向他们走来，不等他开口，就先问道：“运升，光说叫深耕，它有什么好处啊？”“我看田间选种不如场里选种好。在地里，麦穗叫风吹的乱摇晃，哪能看得出好坏来了哇？”
    谁知道为什么要深耕呢？至于田间选种，运升想，果然不如场里选种方便。可是，不表示态度也不行啊，便红着脸说：“上级这么号召，一定对。你们照着作吧，没错。”
    人们一听便哈哈大笑起来。那些上了几岁年纪的农民就教导他说：“运升，论种庄稼的事，你可不行。我作过的庄稼比你见过的还多呢！”那些调皮的青年人，就没有老年人那么厚道了，他们甚至常常嘲弄他：
    “生产委员，我的骡子怎么老不下小驹啊？你来指导指导，让它下个小驹吧！”
    上级抓的紧，群众不听话——还嘲笑你，运升心里很难过，有时生了气，就狠狠地对自己说：
  “明天我就到区上去说，叫我干什么都行，再不当这受气委员了。”可是第二天他没有去——为什么？他自己也说不清楚，反正觉着那么作有什么地方不对劲似的。正在运升苦恼的时候，县农场开办了一个农业技术训练班，要运升去受训。这是一九五一年春天的事。这个春天，变成了运升生命中的春天。训练班虽然只办了十一天，可是他觉得学到的知识，比过去上五、六年学还多。他不仅懂得了很多基本的农业技术常识，更重要的是懂得了一个道理：不会就学，学了就会了。从训练班回来，他买了很多的农业科学小册子，什么“通俗科学知识图画”啦、“科学技术小丛书”啦、“农业生产小丛书”啦，等等。白天，他努力工作；晚上，回到家里，半宿半宿地看书、学习。为了晚上看书的事，他老婆不知道跟他吵了多少次——吵有什么用呢！你吵你的，我看我的。他老婆没法，就跟街坊邻居诉起苦来：
      “他这人钻上个什么了，非钻到底不行。这会子黑夜又看起书来了。一看就是多半宿，让别人也睡不了个安生觉。白天累，黑夜又熬眼，还有不困的？闹过两回错儿了，差点把我们娘儿们烧死。他看着看着书就睡着了，把书打在灯上，一下子就烧着了。我急的连衣裳也顾不得穿，把书拨到地下，用水泼死了。我气的打了他两拳头，可是他一睁眼就问：‘我的书哩？’他思摸着又是我把他的书藏起来了。气的我就说：‘你的书上天了，去找吧！’”
    运升“半宿半宿”地学习，起初，只是为了不受蹩，不受人嘲笑。当他入了门，书就给他带来了一种从来没有经历过的快乐、幸福和满足。书，给他展现了一个无限丰富，无限美妙的新天地。现在，他不仅是工作中碰到疑难时候才去从书上找解答；而是如饥似渴地去追求知识了。他开始更有系统地学习，什么“旱地棉作学”、“种子学”、“耕作学原理”以及米丘林的“优种遗传学”等等，都是他最心爱的读物。如今，学习已经成了他生活的一部分，成为他的一种嗜好和习惯了。在这刻苦不断地学习中，他的农业技术知识一天天丰富起来了：快到播种的时候了，他会告诉人们怎样进行药剂拌种；怎样进行种子春化；喷雾器坏了，他会修理；缺乏肥料了，他会教给人们怎样作高温速成堆肥……反正从耕地播种、防治虫害到各种作物的田间管理；从养鸡养猪到养蜜蜂；从种庄稼到园艺……凡是农民过光景的事，他都懂得；要不，全村那么多人，为什么在一九五三年成立农业生产合作社时，单单选举他当社里的技术股长呢？为什么一九五四年农业社大发展以后，全乡六个村，村村建立起农业社，百分之九十六以上的农民都入社以后，为了指导各个村社的工作，全乡成立起一个农业社的联合社，又选他当联合社的技术股长呢？
  三运升是个好学的人，他不光向书本学习，还向别处的先进经验学习。他跟县农场、运城农场和拖拉机站、技术推广站都有非常密切的联系。他的农业科学知识，有好些是从这些地方学来的。西张耿村的小麦产量年年提高，主要是推广了农场先进经验才获得的。
    提起小麦增产的事，这里面很有一段曲折、动人的经历呢。
    还在一九五一年，运升在农场受训，知道了
  “母壮子肥”的道理，回来就向人们宣传。可是人们不信他，反说：“只要把地养种好，什么种子也能多打粮。”没办法，他只好先在自家地上作试验，一亩来地种了十六种小麦。同样的土地，同样的肥料，同样的耕作，可是十六种麦子的收成不一样。
  “碧玛一号”麦产量最高，三根垅收三十多斤；
  “六○号”麦是第二，收二十八斤；“黑字”麦就不好，只收了十一斤。人们这才相信运升说的“采用优良品种是增产的重要条件之一”的话了。第二年在全村里推广了“碧玛一号”等四个优良品种。也是那一年，运升又向群众宣传了密植增产的道理，把九寸行距的耧改成了七寸的。因此，一九五三年，西张耿村的小麦获得了空前的丰收。每亩麦子的平均产量，达到了一百四十五斤。这年收割麦子时，他在运城农场看见密植四寸五行距的小麦，跟他们村七寸行距的长得同样茂盛，就想把自己村的小麦也改成四寸五。晚上，他在家里看书时，见苏联有很多小麦的行距竟是二寸五，更坚定了他的信心。他满以为头年小麦行距由九寸变为七寸丰收了，现在由七寸变成四寸五，大家一定双手赞成。其实不然，社员们、干部们听了运升的意见，不但没有双手赞成，还坚决地反对。人们说：
    “不论干什么事情，也要有个限度，头年九寸改七寸，今年又要改成四寸五，明年还要改成几寸？”
    运升便用苏联小麦二寸五行距，一亩能收一千多斤的事实给大家解释，可是人们说：
    “咱这不是苏联，人家用拖拉机，咱用老牛；人家用化学肥料，咱用人粪、猪粪、草木灰。人家地好、肥料多、机器种地，咱哪能比得上。”
    “运城农场离咱村才三十里地，不是苏联吧，”运升争辩着，“人家的行距也是四寸半。”“什么地长什么庄稼，人家运城农场的地脉好。”
    运升再用往年种麦种到最后剩下一点种子，值不得往回拿，就手在地头横种几耧，来年长的同样好的事实，向大家解释。
    “那不同，”人们反驳说，“地头通风阳光足，要是里边也种那么密，非乌霉了不可。”
    “那末，”运升无可奈何地说，“少种几亩试验试验吧。”
      “不用试验，”人们还是反对，“明知不行，试验它干啥！”
    左解释右解释，不管怎么说，反正大家是不同意，运升的耐性消失了，把胳臂一扬，赌气地说：
    “社长，把我的地还我；你们不干！我自己干去！”
   人们早就看见运升的嘴唇发抖了——他一着急嘴唇就要发抖的，可没想到他竟能说出这样的话来，大家全愣住了。社长杨士俊惊讶地问他道：
    “怎么，把地还你，要退社么？不想走社会主义的道路了？”
      “你们不让人走嘛！”
    “运升，别这么说，”杨士俊温和地跟他说，
  “谁能不让你走呢？”
    “别以为成立起合作社就能走到社会主义，”运升粗声粗气地说，“要是不按着社会主义的道理办事，不采用新技术，不大大提高生产，还是到不了社会主义的。”
    运升稍微平静了一些以后，又说：
    “咱社的社员都没有留自耕地，要是有自耕地，你们不信，我先在自家的地上种给你们看；现在社里不试验，难道还叫我动员单干户去试验，给合作社作榜样么？！”
    人们不知所答了。大家你看我，我看你，找不出话来反驳他。
    “把地还我，我去试验，”运升接着说，“试验成功了，算社里的；失败了，算我自己的。”
    到这个节骨眼上，人们再也没话说了，只好拨出八亩地让他试验——又怕他试验不成，没有拨给他好地，只拨给了他八亩棉花茬地。“棉茬地就棉茬地吧，”运升想，“不管在什么地上试验，也会显出个高低来。”他在那块三亩地的地段上，用六寸行距的耧，套种了二亩，把行距变成了三寸，留下
  一亩“对照田”，仍按六寸行距播种；在那块五亩的地段上，用六寸耧交叉播了四亩，也留下一亩作对照。人们一看，就笑了：“明年社里小麦增产，就看这两块地了。”“你们笑吧，”运升心里说，“我试验成功了，你们就不笑了。”果然不出所料，第二年麦收时，三种播法，得了三种产量：六寸行距的产量最低，交叉播的要比它的产量高百分之四十；六寸耧套种成行距三寸的，比六寸行距播种的高百分之六十以上。在事实面前，人们相信了。一九五四年，人民政府在西张耿乡建立了机器拖拉机站。秋天，播种小麦时，拖拉机站上的同志向他们说：“要用拖拉机种麦，就要密植到四寸五的行距。”社员们毫无顾虑地说：“播吧，我们技术股长头年在用牛耕的回茬地上，早试验过了，三寸的行距也能增产。如今用拖拉机深耕的地，种四寸五的行距更没问题了。”四
    两年前，运升认为新技术不容易推行开，不容易彻底，是没有组织起来的过错，一家只有十亩八亩地，不敢贸然采用新技术，“万一不成呢，”他向人推广新技术时常听见这样的话，“一家人的饭碗不踢腾了？”所以，一九五二年冬天，县委提出要他们成立农业生产合作社时，运升像迎接喜事那样的迎接合作社的建立，他动员这家，说服那家，要人们参加农业生产合作社。
    成立起农业生产合作社以后，土地统一经营，人们集体劳动，推广新技术的确比过去容易多了。但并不像运升原来想的那样：“成立起合作社以后，推广新技术就没困难了。”在社里虽然没有单干农民那种小私有者性质的保守思想，却有另一种保守思想——社员们不懂技术，因为“从来也没听说过”而产生的一种保守思想。再说，社里推广新技术，不像单干农民那样只在小块地上作；合作社不作是不作，一作就是大面积的。大面积实行新技术，就需要有很多的能掌握新技术的人。可是社员们没有技术，不会作，即便社里决定推广新技术了，还是贯彻不下去。就说建社第一年社里计划夏天往棉田里上一次棵粒肥料那回事吧：本来计划得好好的，偏巧正该施肥的时候，有一百八十多亩棉花上生了蚜虫，配杀虫药水，修理药械，都是运升一个人的事，忙的他连饭也吃不上，哪还有工夫制造棵粒肥料？要别人制吧，又不会，只好不施了，好好的计划也落了空。自从推行棉花根外施肥和小麦密植受到保守思想的阻碍以后；自从棉田施棵粒肥料的计划落空以后；运升体会到：在社里，必须让社员们都懂得了新技术，都掌握了新技术，都会作了，才能更好地推广新技术，贯彻新技术。从这几件事情以后，运升进一步改进了自己的工作方法。他不仅仍然像过去一样，说服大家采用新技术，而且也实地教给社员掌握新技术了。他利用田间休息的时候给社员们讲解新技术，也在劳动中随时抓住各种事实向社员们传播新经验。一九五四年初，西张耿村农业生产合作社又有了很大的发展，全村除那几户地主、富农以外，农民们都入社了。他想：新社员增多了，应该在春耕以前，把技术提高一下，才能保证增产。偏巧，这时候女副社长姚凤兰也注意到了这个问题，也想组织女社员们学技术，他们便把这个意见反映到支部。支部热烈支持他们的意见，决定发动社员积极学习农业技术。于是，一个技术学习小组便建立起来了。参加技术学习小组的有女副社长姚凤兰等十多个青年积极分子。王运升耐心地教他们怎样配杀虫药水，怎样修理药械，怎样制造棵粒肥料……。这时候，又从学校里回来了几个青年学生，他们一到村，就找到了自己的榜样，都决心向运升学习，都参加了技术小组。运升也觉着这些学生是将来传播新技术的一支很好的力量，更用心教他们。初中学生王自全刚回到村里来，什么技术也不懂，现在配制“E六○五”杀虫药，打“六六六”粉，使用喷粉器、喷雾器，作棵粒肥料，曲耀离的棉田管理经验……都学会了。这些青年学生，不仅向运升学习技术，也学习他的工作精神。他们学会以后，又去给社员们传授。五月，中央科学院的几位同志来村里作实验工作，愿意帮助他们教课，王运升、姚凤兰认为是个好机会，便积极动员社员们参加学习，技术学习小组扩大到了二十多人。不久，全乡别的村里的青年们也要求参加学习，于是西张耿村的技术学习小组，又扩大成全乡的技术夜校，学生增加到了八十多人。运升在推行新技术的工作中，深切地体会到：“耳闻不如眼看，眼看不如亲干”，因此，他们在教学中采用“少讲，讲清，讲透，多讨论，地里作什么课堂里学什么，学了就用”的教学方法，学员们学习情绪很高，进步很快。从去年五月办到现在，学员们大都学会了选种、浸种、间苗以及全部的棉田管理技术。这些学员晚上在技术夜校里是学生，白天在生产队中就变成了先生；把学习来的技术，教给没有参加技术夜校的社员们。仅西张耿村就有五十四个男社员，六十七个女社员，学会了棉花整枝、施肥，使用喷雾器治虫等技术，有十二个社员学会掌握喷粉器，九个人学会制颗粒肥料，六个人学会了配制“E六○五”杀虫药粉……。因为他们培养了一支技术力量，夏天才作到了割麦、治虫两不误，保证了棉麦丰收。
    去年六月，麦子熟了。多好的麦子啊，麦穗长的有指头粗，稍微有一点小风，麦穗都挤得嚓嚓响。可是，正在这个时候，棉花发生了蚜虫。棉、麦是西张耿村农业生产合作社的主要庄稼。全社一千七百来亩地，就有八百多亩麦子，七百来亩棉花。麦子不立即收割，就会熟过了劲，造成“落镰”的损失；棉蚜虫不马上防治，棉花又要歉收。不管耽误了割麦或治虫，都会造成社里极大损失。要是在过去，不是误了割麦，就得误了治虫。可是，现在因为社员们都学会了治虫技术，便以男社员为主，又派了三十多个身强力壮的女社员参加割麦；另外的四十多个身体弱些的女社员去治虫。两件事一块作，什么也没耽误，保证了棉、麦丰收。麦子每亩收了一百九十四斤，比一九五三年增产四十九斤，棉花每亩收了二百八十二斤多，比一九五三年增产六十一斤。
    在割麦、治虫两不误的劳动竞赛中，运升是负责领导治虫的。那时，正是天气最热的季节，加上工作又重，人们都非常疲劳。无论割麦的人还是治虫的人，一到中午休息的时候，都是胡乱吃点饭，赶紧往荫凉处一躺，马上便睡着了。运升的身体素来单薄，他不仅要和别人一样地治虫，还要时刻关心别人的工作，看是否按技术要求把药水喷在合适的地方？是否浪费了药水？因此，一到中午，他不仅两臂酸疼，连嗓子都嘶哑了。他真想也像别人那样到荫凉处睡一觉，但性急的脾气使他不肯去休息，他总是利用中午休息的时间，去修理出了毛病的喷雾器。社员们看着他那疲惫不堪的样子，怕他累坏了，常劝他休息休息。可是他说：
    “治虫要治早，才能治了。你看那蚜虫在这燥热的天气里，长的多快！”
    别看王运升工作起来这样认真，这样不辞劳苦，他对自家的事情，却是不大在意。别的社员、干部作了一天工，晚上总要社里把当天的工分记得清清楚楚，甚至还有人未曾作活先打听能挣多少分，总拣那又省力又多挣劳动日的营生干。运升可不这样，他从来没计较过活轻活重，劳动日多少。麦秋里人家别人中午休息，他修理喷雾器，也从来没叫社里给记过工分。几年来他为提高社里的生产，推广新的农业科学技术，买了一百三十多万元的书，也从来没有说过一声“这是为咱社里的生产，应该社里出钱。”总是拿自己的钱去买……。因为他不注意这些，也因为社里没经验，社刚成立的一九五三年年终一算账，数运升得的劳动日少。社员们说：
    “运升从来没干过自己家里一点营生，都是为咱社里的事忙来忙去，这不公平。”
    “咱们社的生产能够年年提高，运升起了很大作用。”支部书记、社的指导员张立秋说：“他自己又不计较个人利益，我提议往后他的劳动日按社的最高标准计算。”支部书记的提议没一个人反对，就一致通过了。有人也曾问过运升，为什么一点也不注意自己的利益？
    “怎么不注意，我的生活不是比解放前好多了么？”他回答，“现在，咱们办的是社会主义的事，社会主义再往前走就到共产主义了。共产主义社会里是各取所需，那时我们的生活就更好了。”
