Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 15th: People in various parts of India are continuing to launch a movement demanding the withdrawal of US armed forces from Taiwan.

	Under the auspices of the Kanpur Committee of the Communist Party of India, Kanpur, an important city in Uttar Pradesh, held a public rally on the 11th demanding the withdrawal of US armed forces from Taiwan. The rally passed a resolution condemning the US imperialists' conspiracy to invade China's territory of Taiwan and demanding that Taiwan—an inseparable part of China—be returned to the People's Republic of China. The resolution called on the people to fully participate in the movement demanding the withdrawal of US imperialists from Taiwan. Participants in the meeting held a parade after the meeting.

	Saharanpur, Uttar Pradesh, held a public rally on the 10th demanding the withdrawal of US armed forces from Taiwan. Jia Lai, a member of the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly, strongly condemned the US atomic threats against China and Asia at the meeting. He said that the US policy is to place Asia under the enslavement of Western countries and to establish US military bases on Asian territories. He said that the United States is conspiring to occupy Taiwan and turn Taiwan into a military base for attacking China. Lai emphasized that the Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan. Independent countries in Asia are fundamentally not prepared to tolerate US interference in their internal affairs.
