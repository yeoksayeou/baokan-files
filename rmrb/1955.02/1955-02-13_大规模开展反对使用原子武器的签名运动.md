The American aggressive bloc's intensified preparations for its heinous atomic war plans have aroused boundless indignation among the people of the world. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council issued a declaration on January 19, calling for a large-scale signature campaign worldwide against the use of atomic weapons, and announcing specific proposals against launching an atomic war: oppose the planners of atomic war now and in the future; destroy all stockpiled atomic weapons; and immediately cease the manufacture of atomic weapons. This call represents the highest interests of all mankind and has been widely and warmly supported by all good people.

Under this call, peace-loving people in various countries are rapidly taking action. The World Federation of Trade Unions, representing millions of people from all over the world, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and people's organizations in many countries have announced their support for this resolution. Now, the Standing Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace have also made a joint expanded meeting resolution:
	“Call on all Chinese people to launch a signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons, and together with peace-loving people all over the world, express a serious protest to the American aggressive bloc.” From Europe to Asia, from America to Africa, calls for signature campaigns are being issued from the capitals of various countries. The Japanese people, who have suffered twice from American atomic bomb attacks and directly suffered from American hydrogen bomb test disasters, are bravely standing at the forefront of this struggle. Under the slogan of "Don't let the Hiroshima tragedy repeat itself," they have launched a warm and extensive movement, and by January 15, more than 22 million people had signed their names demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons. The signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons is rapidly developing into a surging wave among the people all over the world. This wave will deal a crushing blow to the atomic war plans of the enemies of peace.

We have long pointed out that there are two sharply opposing lines on the issue of atomic energy. One is the peaceful line represented by the Soviet Union, which is to devote all efforts to developing the peaceful uses of atomic energy to benefit mankind; resolutely oppose the use of atomic weapons and wage war to slaughter mankind. This is the only correct line that conforms to the interests of all peace-loving people in the world. The other is the war line pursued by the American aggressive bloc, which is to actively prepare to use atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs to launch an atomic war to slaughter mankind; and to try its best to undermine and obstruct the peaceful uses of atomic energy. It is inevitable that the extreme reactionary line of the United States will be resolutely opposed by the people of the world.

The U.S. government has recently openly embarked on the road of preparing to launch an atomic war. If in the past it was only the American warmonger groups who were clamoring for the use of atomic weapons, then last December, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, under the coercion of the United States, passed a resolution approving the plan for an atomic war in Europe. The American bellicose bloc and its followers are also actively arranging to rearm West Germany and to arm German militarist forces with atomic weapons. The American aggressive bloc and some of its followers are constantly promoting atomic war from all sides for the war profits of monopoly capital. Dulles, Radford, Glenther, Stevenson, and others are all doing their best to carry out this propaganda, as if they are afraid that these weapons of mass destruction cannot be used quickly.

In Asia, American aggressive forces are arbitrarily interfering in our internal affairs, obstructing the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, and forcibly occupying our territory of Taiwan. It is also attempting to further invade our coastal islands, sever Chinese territory, and turn Taiwan, Penghu, and the coastal islands into American military bases as a bridgehead for attacking our mainland. The purpose of the United States is to expand its aggression against our country, vainly attempting to overthrow our people's democratic regime and restore the traitorous group of Chiang Kai-shek, the American puppet, in China. While doing so, it has repeatedly clamored to use atomic weapons, vainly attempting to intimidate the Chinese people. This aggressive act of the American aggressive bloc has aroused the greatest indignation of the entire Chinese people. We must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, and the coastal islands, and we must eliminate the traitorous group of Chiang Kai-shek. All the armed forces of the United States must get out of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. The liberation of Taiwan is entirely China's internal affair and must not allow foreign interference.

The imperialist war bloc headed by the United States, which is hostile to the Chinese people, is increasingly resorting to the threat of atomic weapons. They are attempting to legalize the use of atomic weapons to facilitate their expansion of aggression and preparation for new wars. The American policy of preparing for atomic weapons war and their clamor will never intimidate the great people of the Soviet Union, the Chinese people, the people of the people's democratic countries, and all peace-loving people in the world. These actions of the American aggressors completely expose them as enemies of mankind, and can only arouse greater indignation among the people, and can only strengthen the people's firm determination to oppose atomic weapons war and stop the evil conspiracies of the American warmongers.

Completely opposed to the position of the American ruling group, the Soviet Union, for the benefit and security of the people of the world, has consistently opposed the manufacture and use of atomic weapons, and resolutely advocated the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. The Soviet Union has repeatedly put forward proposals to ban atomic weapons at the United Nations General Assembly. Soviet scientists have spared no effort to devote themselves to the research of using atomic energy for peaceful purposes. In 1954, the Soviet Union achieved great achievements in this regard and built the world's first atomic energy industrial power station. The Soviet Union's achievements in the peaceful use of atomic energy have opened up infinitely bright prospects for human civilization. Now, the Soviet Union has decided to open its experience in the peaceful use of atomic energy to all countries in the world, including capitalist countries, in order to promote international cooperation in the peaceful use of atomic energy, which is conducive to the economic and cultural development of all countries. The Soviet Union will help the People's Republic of China, the People's Republic of Poland, the Czechoslovak Republic, the Romanian People's Republic, and the German Democratic Republic to develop research on the peaceful uses of atomic energy, and is prepared to expand the scope of the countries it can assist. The Soviet Union has declared to the world with actions that it cares about freeing the world from the danger of atomic war forever, and using the results of the hard work of scientists to benefit mankind and promote world civilization. This proposition and action of the Soviet Union has been warmly praised by the people of the world.

While firmly advocating the prohibition of the manufacture and use of atomic weapons, the Soviet Union issued a solemn and powerful warning to those war fanatics who wield atomic weapons, pointing out that even in atomic weapons, they not only cannot maintain a monopoly, but even the advantages they boast about do not exist. This greatly strengthens the people's confidence in the struggle against atomic war.

Comrade Molotov pointed out that the Soviet Union's achievements in hydrogen weapons have already left the United States behind. This should be a powerful sobering agent for the imperialist war forces.

The Chinese people, like all peace-loving people in the world, have consistently advocated the prohibition of atomic weapons, the elimination of the threat of atomic war, and the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. We have always expressed extreme resentment and resolute opposition to the atomic clamor of the Wall Street war maniacs. In 1950, shortly after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese people enthusiastically supported the call of the Standing Committee of the World Congress for Peace, and more than 220 million people signed the Stockholm Appeal demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons. The great achievements of the Soviet Union in the peaceful use of atomic energy have greatly encouraged the Chinese people. The Chinese people express warm support for the Soviet Union's insistence on opposing atomic weapons and on developing the cause of peaceful use of atomic energy on the basis of international cooperation. The Soviet Union's decision to assist our country in carrying out research on the peaceful use of atomic energy is even more sincerely welcomed and appreciated by the Chinese people. There is no doubt that with the help of the great Soviet Union, the 600 million Chinese people engaged in peaceful construction will certainly be able to master atomic science and technology and serve our socialist construction cause.

The Chinese people love peace and understand the preciousness of peace. We oppose wars of aggression and the use of atomic weapons, but we are never afraid of the imperialist war threats and atomic intimidation. In fact, those imperialists who use atomic bombs for blackmail and intimidation are the ones who are most afraid of atomic war today. Because they have not only lost their monopoly on atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, lost their advantages in this regard, but also their countries have the most concentrated population and industry, and are most afraid of the destruction of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, we had broad possibilities for creating a happy new life with peaceful labor. Our factories, our agricultural production cooperatives, our youth's joyful campuses, our scientists' laboratories...all these fruits of peaceful labor, which are being built up from the ground, are sacred and inviolable. We are determined to defend our peaceful labor, defend our families, defend our beloved motherland, and defend world peace. We have the strength to do so, and we also have the firm determination to do so. Therefore, we warmly respond to the solemn call of the World Peace Council, and we must widely launch a great signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons throughout the country.

Every one of us has a share of enthusiasm and can emit a share of strength. We must use a lively and cordial signature method to show the great strength of the 600 million people of our country. We must use the widespread signature movement of the Chinese people to support the great march of the people of the world to defend peace. Our signature is our solemn oath to defend our peaceful labor and defend peace. We are starting the signature campaign on a nationwide scale around the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, which is once again showing the war mongers headed by the United States that the close friendship between the Chinese and Soviet people is unbreakable. The strong unity between China and the Soviet Union will be the most reliable guarantee for defeating the planners of atomic war. Our signature is a serious warning to the American aggressive bloc and atomic war planners. Our signature is a major support for the peace-loving humanity of the world. We must make the righteous call against atomic weapons universally spread to every corner of China, every village, every factory, every hospital and school. We must make this movement deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, known to every household; so that people across the country, regardless of men and women, young and old, regardless of occupation and belief, can participate in the signature. As long as we do this, as long as we, together with peace-loving people all over the world, firmly and bravely move forward and carry out a tenacious struggle against the use of atomic weapons and against the war threats of the United States, we will certainly be able to defeat the American aggressive bloc's evil conspiracy to prepare for atomic war, and we will certainly be able to defend peace.

We firmly believe that what determines the outcome of war is not weapons, but the people. If American imperialism ignores the opposition of the people of the world and dares to risk launching an atomic war, then we can conclude that its result will only be the demise of the American aggressive bloc itself. Today, the world's peace and democratic forces headed by the Soviet Union are even stronger, and the momentum of the people is even greater. Now, the signature movement of the Chinese people and the people of the world against the use of atomic weapons will converge into an unprecedentedly strong torrent of defending peace. In the face of this torrent, the American aggressive bloc and the atomic war planners should honestly sit down and think about the shameful consequences that their crazy activities will bring to them.

### 大规模开展反对使用原子武器的签名运动

    大规模开展反对使用原子武器的签名运动
    美国侵略集团加紧准备进行原子战争的罪恶计划，激起了全世界人民无比的愤怒。世界和平理事会常务委员会一月十九日发表宣言，号召在全世界发动大规模的反对使用原子武器的签名运动，并且宣布了反对发动原子战争的具体主张：在现在和将来，都要反对原子战争的策划者；毁掉储存的全部原子武器；立即停止制造原子武器。这个号召代表着全人类的最高利益，受到了一切善良人民广泛的热烈的拥护。
    在这个号召之下，各国爱好和平的人民正在迅速地行动起来。代表全世界各地千百万人民的世界工会联合会、世界民主青年联盟和许多国家的人民团体已宣布了拥护这个决议。现在，中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会常务委员和中国人民保卫世界和平委员会常务委员联席扩大会议也做出了决议：
  “号召全中国人民，举行反对使用原子武器的签名运动，同全世界爱好和平的人民一道，向美国侵略集团表示严重抗议。”从欧洲到亚洲，从美洲到非洲，开展签名运动的号召正从各国的首都发布出来。两度惨遭美国原子弹轰炸并直接蒙受美国氢弹试验灾害的日本人民，正勇敢地站在这个斗争的最前列。他们在“不许广岛事件重演”的口号下，已经展开了热烈广泛的运动，到一月十五日为止已有二千二百多万人签名要求禁止原子武器。反对使用原子武器的签名运动正在全世界各地的人民中间迅速发展成为一股汹涌的浪潮。这股浪潮将给予和平敌人的原子战争计划以粉碎性的打击。
    我们早已指出，在原子能问题上存在着尖锐对立的两条路线。一个是以苏联为代表的和平路线，这就是全力发展原子能的和平用途，使它为人类谋福利；坚决反对使用原子武器，进行战争来屠杀人类。这是符合全世界一切爱好和平人民利益的唯一正确的路线。另一个是美国侵略集团所奉行的战争路线，那就是积极准备利用原子弹和氢弹来发动屠杀人类的原子战争；极力破坏和阻挠原子能的和平用途。美国的极端反动的路线受到全世界人民的坚决反对是必然的。
    美国政府近来更公开地走上了准备发动原子战争的道路。如果说过去还只是美国战争贩子集团中在叫嚣使用原子武器，那么，去年十二月在美国挟持下的北大西洋联盟理事会已通过了决议，批准在欧洲进行原子战争的计划。美国好战集团及其追随者还积极安排重新武装西德，并且要用原子武器来武装德国军国主义势力。美国侵略集团和它的一些追随者们为了垄断资本的战争利润，正在从各方面不断地宣传原子战争。杜勒斯、雷德福、格仑瑟、史蒂文森等，都在竭力进行这种宣传，好像是唯恐这些大规模毁灭性武器不能很快拿来使用。
    在亚洲，美国侵略势力蛮横地干涉我国内政，阻挠中国人民解放台湾，强占我国的领土台湾。它并且企图进一步侵占我国沿海岛屿、割裂中国领土，把台湾澎湖和沿海岛屿都变成美国的军事基地，作为进攻我国大陆的桥头堡。美国的目的是要扩大对我国的侵略，妄想借此推翻我国人民民主政权，使美国的傀儡蒋介石的卖国集团在中国复辟。它在这样作的时候，也重重复复地叫嚣要使用原子武器，妄想借此来吓倒中国人民。美国侵略集团的这种侵略行动激起了全中国人民最大的愤怒。我们一定要解放台湾澎湖和沿海岛屿，一定要消灭蒋介石卖国集团。美国的一切武装力量必须从台湾和台湾海峡滚出去。解放台湾完全是中国的内政，决不能容许外来干涉。
    以美国为首的、仇视中国人民的帝国主义战争集团，正日益求助于原子武器的威胁。他们企图使原子武器的使用合法化，来便利他们扩大侵略、准备新战争。美国这种准备原子武器战争的政策和他们的叫嚣绝不可能吓倒伟大的苏联人民、中国人民、人民民主国家的人民以及全世界一切爱好和平的人民。美国侵略者的这些做法完全暴露了他们是人类的公敌，只能激起人民更大的义愤，只能更加强人民反对原子武器战争、制止美国战争贩子的罪恶阴谋的坚定决心。
    和美国统治集团的立场完全相反，苏联为了全世界人民的福利和安全，一贯反对制造和使用原子武器，坚决主张把原子能用于和平目的。苏联曾在历届联合国大会上一次又一次地提出过禁止原子武器的建议。苏联科学家更是不遗余力地致力于研究使用原子能于和平目的。一九五四年，苏联在这方面取得了伟大的成就，建成了世界上第一个原子能工业电力站。苏联在和平利用原子能方面这种成就为人类文明开辟了无限光辉的前景。现在，苏联已决定向世界各国，包括资本主义各国在内，公开其和平利用原子能的经验，以促进在和平利用原子能方面的国际合作，有利于一切国家的经济、文化的发展。苏联将帮助中华人民共和国、波兰人民共和国、捷克斯洛伐克共和国、罗马尼亚人民共和国和德意志民主共和国发展原子能和平用途方面的研究，并准备扩大它所能够援助的国家的范围。苏联用行动向全世界声明，它关心的是使世界永远摆脱原子战争的危险，而使各国科学家辛勤劳动的成果，用来造福人类，推进世界的文明。苏联这种主张和行动受到了世界人民的热烈赞扬。
    苏联在坚决主张禁止制造和使用原子武器的同时，向那些挥舞原子武器的战争狂热者发出了严正有力的警告，指出他们即使是在原子武器方面，也不但不能保持垄断的地位，甚至连他们所吹嘘的优势都不存在。这就大大加强了人民反对原子战争的斗争的信心。
    莫洛托夫同志表明，苏联在氢武器方面取得的成就已经使美国落在后面。这对于帝国主义战争势力，应该是一服有力的清醒剂。
    中国人民同世界一切爱好和平的人民一样，一贯主张禁止原子武器、消除原子战争威胁，主张把原子能用于和平目的。我们一贯对华尔街战争病狂者的原子叫嚣表示了极端的愤恨和坚决的反对。一九五○年，中华人民共和国成立后不久，中国人民便热烈地支持了世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的号召，有二亿二千多万人在要求禁止原子武器的斯德哥尔摩宣言上签了名。苏联在和平利用原子能方面的伟大成就，使我国人民受到了极大的鼓舞。苏联坚持反对原子武器、坚持在国际合作基础上发展和平运用原子能的事业的主张，我国人民表示热烈拥护。苏联决定援助我国进行和平利用原子能的研究工作，更是我国人民衷心欢迎和感谢的。毫无疑问：在伟大苏联的帮助下，从事和平建设的六亿中国人民将一定能够掌握原子科学和技术，为我们的社
  会主义建设事业服务。
    中国人民热爱和平，更懂得和平的可贵。我们反对侵略战争，反对使用原子武器，但是我们决不害怕帝国主义的战争威胁和原子恫吓。其实，在今天最害怕原子战争的，正是那些用原子弹进行讹诈、进行恫吓的帝国主义者。因为它们不但已经失去了对于原子武器和氢武器的垄断，失去了在这方面的优势，并且正是他们的国家的人口和工业最集中，最怕原子武器和氢武器的破坏。一九四九年中华人民共和国成立以后，我们有了用和平劳动创造幸福新生活的宽广可能。正在从平地上一个个建设起来的我们的工厂、我们的农业生产合作社、我们青年的欢乐的校园、我们科学家的实验室……这一切和平劳动的成果是神圣不可侵犯的。我们坚决要保卫我们的和平劳动，保卫我们的家庭，保卫我们可爱的祖国，保卫世界和平。我们有这样做的力量，也有这样做的坚定决心。因此，我们热烈响应世界和平理事会的庄严号召，我们一定要在全国广泛开展反对使用原子武器的伟大签名运动。
    我们每个人有一分热，就能发出一分力量。我们要用生动亲切的签名方式来显示我国六亿人民的这种巨大力量。我们要用中国人民广泛的签名运动来支援全世界人民保卫和平的伟大进军。我们签名，就是我们为保卫我们的和平劳动、保卫和平的庄严宣誓。我们恰在中苏友好同盟互助条约签订五周年纪念日的前后在全国范围内开始进行签名，这就是向美国为首的战争贩子再一次地显示中苏人民的亲密友谊是牢不可破的。中苏两国的坚强团结，将是击败原子战争策划者的最可靠的保证。我们签名，就是对美国侵略集团和原子战争策划者的严重警告。我们签名，就是对全世界和平人类的重大支持。我们要使反对原子武器的正义号召普遍传到中国的每一个角落，每一个村庄，每一个工厂，每一个医院和学校。我们要使这个运动深入人心，家喻户晓；使全国人民不分男女老少，不论职业和信仰，都能参加签名。只要我们这样做，只要我们同全世界爱好和平人民一道，坚定地奋勇前进，为反对使用原子武器、反对美国的战争威胁而进行顽强的斗争，我们就一定能够击败美国侵略集团准备原子战争的罪恶阴谋，就一定能够保卫和平。
    我们坚决相信，决定战争胜负的不是武器，而是人民。如果美国帝国主义不顾全世界人民的反对，竟敢冒险发动原子战争，那么，我们可以断定，它的结果只会是美国侵略集团自己的灭亡。今天，以苏联为首的世界和平民主力量更加强大了，人民的声势是更见浩大了。现在，中国人民和全世界人民反对使用原子武器的签名运动更将汇集成空前壮大的保卫和平的洪流。在这个洪流面前，美国侵略集团和原子战争的策划者应该老老实实坐下来，想一想他们的疯狂活动将给他们带来的可耻的后果。
