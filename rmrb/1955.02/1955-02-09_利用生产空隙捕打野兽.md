Guizhou Province's hunting teams, under the leadership and support of local Party committees and People's Governments, killed more than 266,000 wild animals last year, including more than 1,600 tigers and leopards. This ensured the safety of people and livestock and reduced damage to crops. After Yonghe Township in Anlong County established a hunting team, crop damage caused by wild animals last year decreased by more than 90% compared to the previous year. In order to ensure a good harvest for the spring crops and the smooth progress of spring plowing preparations, some areas are currently reorganizing hunting teams and hunting animals during production gaps.

    利用生产空隙捕打野兽
    贵州省各地打猎队，在当地党委和人民政府的领导和支持下，去年共打死了野兽二十六万六千多只，其中虎豹一千六百多只。保证了人畜生命安全和农作物少受损害。安龙县永和乡成立打兽队后，去年庄稼所遭受的兽害，比前年减少了百分之九十多。为了保证小春丰收、春耕准备工作顺利开展，目前有些地方正整顿打兽队，利用生产空隙打兽。（萧文修，柳逸）
