A letter from the Financial and Economic Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region: The suggestion published in the "Reader's Letters" section of the People's Daily on November 28th of last year regarding the need to solve the problem of insufficient commercial pastures in our region is correct. Since our region implemented comprehensive management of livestock product procurement last year, business operations have expanded, but commercial pastures have not been established in a timely and corresponding manner. Some temporary pastures are either unsuitable for winter grazing due to the cold climate, or unsuitable for long-term grazing due to poor water and grass conditions, which increases the difficulty of livestock feeding.

Because there are no fixed pastures or insufficient pastures, it is impossible to build sheds and enclosures for livestock to overwinter, which does indeed create certain difficulties for livestock overwintering and maintaining their condition. However, the severe weight loss and death of livestock are also due to the fact that we focused solely on quantity during procurement, acquiring sick and weak livestock. Some pasture staff members lacked a strong sense of responsibility and were poor at feeding and management. This was a painful lesson! To this end, we have sent a working group to the site to investigate and resolve the situation, and those who have neglected their duties will be severely punished.

    内蒙古商业牧场不足问题已着手解决
    内蒙古自治区财政经济委员会来信：去年十一月二十八日人民日报“读者来信专页”刊登的关于我区应解决商业牧场不足问题的建议是对的。我区自从去年在牲畜业收购中实行全面管理以来，经营业务扩大，而商业牧场没有及时相适应地建立起来。有些临时性的牧场，或因气候寒冷不宜冬季放牧，或因水草不好不宜长期放牧，使牲畜饲养上增加困难。
    由于没有固定草场或草场不足，不能建筑牲畜过冬的棚、圈等设备，的确使牲畜过冬、保膘上造成一定的困难；但牲畜严重掉膘和死亡的原因，还由于收购时单纯注意数量，把病、弱牲畜都收购进来，有些牧场工作人员责任心不强，饲养管理不善所致。这是一次惨痛的教训！为此，我们已派工作组到现场检查解决，对失职人员将予以严肃处理。
