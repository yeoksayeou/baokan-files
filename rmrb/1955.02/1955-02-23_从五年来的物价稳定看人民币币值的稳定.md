    Seeing the Stability of the Renminbi Exchange Rate from the Perspective of Price Stability Over the Past Five Years
    Zhang Wen
      (I) Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Party and the People's Government have attached great importance to curbing inflation and stabilizing prices.
    In March 1950, the Central People's Government issued the "Decision on Unifying Financial and Economic Work," which was implemented throughout the country. In a short period of time, it brought the state's fiscal revenue and expenditure close to balance, eliminated the budget deficit, and stopped the large-scale inflation left over from the twelve years of war and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. At the same time, it severely cracked down on speculative activities in the market. From this period on, the era of stable Renminbi exchange rates began.
    The Renminbi exchange rate has been stable for the past five years and is becoming increasingly consolidated. It has played a significant role in the People's Liberation War and the recovery and development of the national economy. It has also played a significant role in combating speculative merchants who harm the interests of the people, ensuring price stability, and safeguarding the interests of the people.
      (II) The stability of the Renminbi exchange rate over the past five years can be fully demonstrated by the stability of commodity prices over the past five years. Because price is the monetary expression of the value of a commodity. To illustrate the stability of the Renminbi with the stability of commodity prices, we can look at the following aspects:
      1. National wholesale price index: Taking March 1950 as 100, it dropped to 75.1 in April, 85.4 in December, 96.6 in December 1951, 90.6 in December 1952, 91.7 in December 1953, and 92.3 in December 1954. (Note: The above wholesale price index coefficients are compiled from ten large and medium-sized cities and dozens of major commodities.) The above index shows that after the unified financial and economic work in March 1950, due to the disappearance of false purchasing power (hoarding and panic buying) in the market, prices fell briefly in April and May, and then achieved basic stability. After the outbreak of the US imperialist war of aggression against Korea in 1950, the wholesale price index rose slightly, but after the great "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements, it was completely stabilized again, creating favorable conditions for large-scale economic construction thereafter. The long-term stability of commodity prices in our country is a normal phenomenon that has not been seen in China for decades.
    2. Commodity Analysis: The stability of grain and cotton cloth prices is the key to overall price stability. The Party and the People's Government have always paid close attention to the stability of grain and cotton cloth prices. As early as the beginning of 1951, the state announced the decision to purchase cotton yarn under a unified plan, initially incorporating cotton yarn prices into the state plan, thereby stabilizing yarn prices. The method of purchasing and regulating grain in the free market was adopted for grain. After the state entered a period of large-scale construction, in order to guarantee the people's needs for food and clothing and stabilize prices, the state implemented unified purchase and sale of grain and cotton cloth in 1953 and 1954 respectively. The implementation of the unified purchase and sale policy proved that the state's control of grain and cotton cloth, in addition to reasonably guaranteeing the needs of the people, also achieved complete price stability. In the severe floods of 1954, the state's selling price of grain did not change at all, fundamentally changing the old rule in Chinese history that "grain prices rise with the flood." In addition, in terms of non-staple foods, although there have been varying degrees of supply shortages and price increases due to the fact that the growth rate of production has not kept up with the growth rate of consumption. However, on the one hand, production was actively increased under the guidance of the state. On the other hand, state-owned and cooperative enterprises vigorously strengthened purchasing and supply, combined with the socialist transformation of private merchants and market management. Now the prices of major non-staple foods have gradually stabilized. For example, the retail prices of major non-staple foods in Shanghai during this year's Spring Festival are lower than those of last year's Spring Festival, except for the prices of pork, eggs, and soybean oil, while the prices of chicken, fish, beef, dried vegetables, fresh vegetables, and fruits have all decreased.
    The prices of industrial equipment for production materials have also been stabilized at a reasonable level due to the recovery and development of domestic production, the expansion of trade in the world's peaceful and democratic markets, the continuous strengthening of state planning, and the expansion of the scope of internal distribution within state-owned enterprises.
    (III) The following table shows the price changes of grain and cloth in Beijing and Shanghai over the past five years: The above table shows that the prices of grain and cloth in large cities have basically not changed and have even decreased slightly over the past five years. At the same time, the wage income of urban workers has been continuously increasing over the past five years, which guarantees that the lives of urban workers are improving year by year.
    (IV) The following table shows the price changes of grain and major industrial products and their relative prices in three rural markets over the past five years:
    The above table shows that the amount of industrial products that farmers can now buy when selling the same amount of grain as five years ago has increased compared to five years ago. This is an important guarantee for the Renminbi to penetrate into rural areas, win the love of farmers, and for farmers to actively increase production and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.
    (V) The following table shows the price changes of wool, cloth, and brick tea and their relative prices in Xining market in ethnic minority areas over the past five years:
    The above table shows that the amount of tea and cloth that herders in ethnic minority areas can now buy when selling the same amount of wool as five years ago has also increased greatly compared to five years ago. This is an important guarantee for the Renminbi to penetrate into pastoral areas and replace silver dollars, and for herders to actively increase production and consolidate national unity.
    (VI) The stability of the Renminbi exchange rate and commodity prices in our country is primarily due to the tremendous recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production over the past five years under the correct leadership of the Party and the People's Government. During the recovery period, the total industrial output value in our country increased by an average of 36.9 percent annually. During the construction period, the speed of industrial development was naturally lower, but the total industrial output value in 1953 still increased by 33 percent compared to 1952. If we add agriculture and handicrafts, the total industrial and agricultural output value in 1954 will be equal to 2.2 times that of 1949. Such a speed of development was unimaginable in old China. The continuous development of industrial and agricultural production is the foundation for the stability of the Renminbi exchange rate. In addition, the issuance of the Renminbi in our country is adapted to the actual needs of national economic development and is issued by the unified national bank - the People's Bank of China - according to the needs of planned industrial and agricultural production and commodity circulation, so there will be no inflation, but rather basic adaptation. This is an important factor in the stability of the Renminbi exchange rate and commodity prices in our country, and it is also one of the important superiorities of the Renminbi over the currency of old China and capitalist currencies.
    Secondly, it is due to the continuous growth of the proportion of the socialist economy. The output value of state-owned, cooperative, and joint state-private industries in the total industrial output value is expected to increase from 37 percent in 1949 to about 71 percent in 1954. The proportion of state-owned and cooperative commerce in the total social retail sales has accounted for about 50 percent in 1954, and the proportion in the total wholesale sales has accounted for about 80 percent. The growth of the proportion of the socialist economy, coupled with the development of the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement and the implementation of the state's policy of socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, all guarantee the stability of the Renminbi exchange rate and commodity prices. It should be particularly emphasized here that state-owned commercial enterprises have controlled all or most of the major commodities related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and have about 20,000 state-owned commercial networks distributed in large, medium, and small cities across the country, plus the powerful assistants of state-owned commercial enterprises (supply and marketing cooperatives and consumer cooperatives) with more than 30,000 grass-roots societies. They all sell commodities according to the prices planned and stipulated by the government, which is a huge organizational force for guaranteeing the stability of the Renminbi and commodity prices. As Comrade Stalin pointed out: "What guarantees the stability of our currency is, first of all, the huge amount of commodities controlled by the state, which are included in the scope of commodity circulation at stable prices. I ask, which economist can deny that this guarantee unique to the Soviet Union is more practical than any gold reserve in guaranteeing currency stability?"
  (Stalin: "Summary of the First Five-Year Plan") Comrade Stalin's above-mentioned point is also completely applicable to the currency in our country's transition period. We had such experience in the past five years. When the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea began in the second half of 1950, 85 percent of the country's cotton cloth production was controlled by state-owned commercial enterprises, while private merchants only controlled 15 percent. However, this 15 percent played a bad role in fluctuating prices. Later, the government adopted the method of unified purchase of cotton yarn, and yarn prices stabilized. This shows that the stability of finance and commodity prices can be reliably guaranteed only when the major commodities related to the national economy and the people's livelihood are controlled by the state.
    Finally, and most fundamentally, the Renminbi is in the hands of the People's Government that serves the people. It is not a means of "capitalist economy," but a means for the People's Government to carry out socialist construction and socialist transformation. Therefore, all financial and economic measures taken by the People's Government (such as the unified purchase and sale of grain, oil, cloth, and cotton in the past year or so) have paid attention to maintaining the stability of the Renminbi exchange rate and commodity prices. It is not a tool to exploit the people, but a tool to serve the people. This essence of the Renminbi, which is different from the currency of old China and imperialist countries, determines that the Renminbi, like the currency of the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries, is one of the most solid and stable currencies in the world.
    (VII) We can fully believe that due to the rapid development of national socialist industrialization, the advancement of the cause of socialist transformation, the continuous growth of the proportion of the socialist economy, and the further consolidation of the people's regime, the exchange rate of the new Renminbi will inevitably be more stable than that of the old Renminbi.

    从五年来的物价稳定看人民币币值的稳定
    张文
      （一）自中华人民共和国成立以来，党和人民政府就十分重视制止通货膨胀和稳定物价的工作。
    一九五零年三月中央人民政府发布了“关于统
  一财政经济工作的决定”并在全国范围内贯彻实现后，很短的时期内就使国家财政收支接近平衡，消灭了预算赤字；停止了十二年来因战争及国民党反动统治所遗留下的巨大规模的通货膨胀；同时也严重地打击了市场上的投机活动。从这个时期开始，人民币币值稳定的时代便开始了。
    五年来人民币币值一直是稳定的，而且是日益巩固的。它在人民解放战争中和国民经济的恢复和发展过程中都发挥了重大的作用。它在打击危害人民利益的投机奸商、保证物价稳定、维护人民利益等方面，也都发挥了重大的作用。
      （二）五年来人民币币值的稳定情况，可以从五年来商品价格的稳定情况中得到充分的证明。因为价格是商品价值的货币表现。用物价的稳定情况来说明人民币的稳定，可以从如下几个方面来看：
      一、全国批发物价指数：如以一九五○年三月为一○○，四月降为七五点一，十二月为八五点四，一九五一年十二月为九六点六，一九五二年十二月为九○点六，一九五三年十二月为九一点七，
  一九五四年十二月为九二点三。（注：以上批发物价指数系数十个大中城市和数十种主要商品编制的）以上指数说明在一九五零年三月统一财政经济工作之后，由于市场上虚假购买力（囤积抢购）的消失，物价在四、五月份一度下落之后，就取得了基本稳定的局面。一九五零年美帝国主义侵朝战争爆发后，批发物价指数虽又略有上升，但在伟大的
  “三反”“五反”运动以后又得到完全的稳定，并为此后的大规模经济建设创造了有利的条件。我国物价长时期的稳定，是中国近几十年来所没有的正常的现象。
    二、商品分析：粮食、纱布价格的稳定是整个物价稳定的关键。党和人民政府自来对粮食纱布的价格稳定给以密切的注意。早在一九五一年初，国家便公布了棉纱统购的决定，把棉纱价格初步纳入国家计划轨道，从而稳定了纱价。对粮食采取在自由市场收购和调剂的办法。国家进入大规模建设时期以后，为了保证人民的吃穿需要并稳定物价，先后在一九五三年与一九五四年对粮食、棉布实行了统购统销。统购统销政策的贯彻证明了由国家掌握了粮食和纱布，除合理的保证了人民的需要外，并且取得了价格的完全稳定。在一九五四年严重的水灾情况下，国家出卖粮食的价格毫无变动，根本改变了中国历史上“粮食跟着水势涨”的旧规律。此外，在副食品方面，尽管由于生产增长的速度赶不上消费增长的速度，曾出现了不同程度的供应紧张和价格上涨现象。但是一方面在国家指导下积极增加了生产，另一方面，国营与合作社间经过大力加强收购与供应，结合着对私商的社会主义改造与市场的管理，到现在主要副食品的价格也已经逐渐的稳定下来了。例如上海市今年春节主要副食品的零售价格和去年春节比较、除猪肉、鸡蛋、豆油价格上升外，鸡、鱼、牛肉、干菜、鲜菜、水果价格均是下降的。
    生产资料的工业器材价格，也因国内生产的恢复和发展，世界和平民主市场贸易的扩大，加以国家计划性的不断加强，国营企业内部分配范围的扩大，也在合理的水平上取得了稳定。
    （三）从北京上海两个大城市粮食和布匹五年来的价格变化来看，列表如左：上表说明五年来大城市的粮食、布匹价格基本上没有变动，且稍有下降，而城市劳动人民的工资收入，五年来不断的在提高着，这就保障了城市劳动人民的生活在逐年的得到改善。
    （四）从三个农村市场五年来的粮食和主要工业品的价格及其比价的变化来看，列表如左：
    上表说明农民现在卖出与五年前同样数量的粮食所得到的人民币，去购买工业品时所买到的数量比五年前增加了。这是人民币深入农村，取得农民爱护，以及农民积极增加生产和巩固工农联盟的重要保证。
    （五）从少数民族地区西宁市场五年来羊毛和布匹、砖茶的价格及其比价的变化来看，列表如左：
    上表说明少数民族牧民现在卖出与五年前同样数量的羊毛所得到的人民币，去购买其所需要的茶、布数量比五年前也大大增加了。这是人民币深入牧区代替了银元，以及牧民积极增加生产和巩固民族团结的重要保证。
    （六）我国人民币币值与物价的稳定，首先是由于在党和人民政府的正确领导下，五年来的工农业生产有了巨大的恢复和发展的结果。我国在恢复期间，工业总产值平均每年递增百分之三十六点九；在建设期间，工业发展的速度当然要低些，但是一九五三年工业总产值仍然比一九五二年增加了百分之三十三。如果加上农业和手工业，一九五四年的工农业总产值，将等于一九四九年的二点二倍。这样的发展速度，在旧中国是不能够设想的。工农业生产不断的发展，是人民币币值稳定的基础；加之我国人民币的发行是适应着国民经济发展的实际需要，由统一的国家银行——中国人民银行——按照有计划的工农业生产和商品流通的需要来发行的，所以就不会出现通货膨胀的现象，而是基本上相适应的。这是我国人民币币值与物价能够稳定的重要因素，也是人民币对旧中国货币以及资本主义货币重要优越性之一。
    其次是由于社会主义经济比重不断增长的结果。国营、合作社营和公私合营工业的产值，在工业总产值中的比重，一九五四年预计将由一九四九年的百分之三十七上升为百分之七十一左右，国营和合作社营商业在社会商品零售总额中的比重，一九五四年已占百分之五十左右，在批发总额中的比重已占百分之八十左右。社会主义经济比重的增长，加上农业互助合作运动的开展，国家对资本主义工商业社会主义改造政策的贯彻实施，这一切都在保证着人民币币值和物价的稳定。在这里应该特别强调提出的是国营商业已经掌握了有关国计民生的主要商品的全部或大部，且有分布全国大、中、小城市的约两万个国营商业网，加上国营商业的强大助手
  （供销合作社和消费合作社）约三万余个基层社，它们都按照政府所计划规定的价格出售商品，这对于保证人民币和物价的稳定是十分巨大的组织力量。正如斯大林同志所指示：“保证我国货币稳定性的，首先就是国家所支配的巨量商品，这些商品是按照稳定价格加入商品流转范围的。试问有那一个经济学家，能够否认苏联所独有的这种保证要比任何黄金准备更能切实保证货币稳定性呢？”
  （斯大林：“第一个五年计划底总结”）斯大林同志上述指出，对于我国过渡时期的货币同样是完全适用的，我国在过去五年中有过这样的经验，在一九五○年下半年抗美援朝开始时，那时全国的纱布产量已有百分之八十五由国营商业所掌握，私商只有百分之十五，但这百分之十五却起了波动价格的坏作用，后来政府采取了棉纱统购的办法，纱价才稳定下来。这说明关于国计民生的主要商品掌握在国家手中，金融物价的稳定才得到可靠的保证。
    最后，也是最根本的原因，是人民币掌握在为人民服务的人民政府手中，它不是“资本主义经济”的手段，而成为人民政府进行社会主义建设和社会主义改造的手段了，因此人民政府采取的一切财政经济措施，（如近一年多来粮、油、布、棉的统购统销）都注意了保持人民币币值和物价的稳定。它不是剥削人民的工具，而是为人民服务的工具了。人民币不同于旧中国和帝国主义国家货币的这一本质，就决定了人民币和苏联及其他人民民主国家的货币一样是世界上最巩固最稳定的货币之一。
    （七）我们完全可以相信，由于国家社会主义工业化的飞跃发展，由于社会主义改造事业的前进，社会主义经济比重的不断增长，由于人民政权的更加巩固，新人民币的币值必然将会比旧人民币更加稳定。
