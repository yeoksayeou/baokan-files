    For Peace, For the Conscience of Humanity
    Acting President of the Buddhist Association of China, Xirao Jiacuo
    In order to safeguard lasting world peace, the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council recently issued an "Appeal to the People of the World," calling on people worldwide to launch a signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons. This call represents the conscience of humanity and the common aspirations of peace-loving people around the world, and it also aligns with Buddha's aim of saving the world and its people. Buddha taught us to: "Do no evil, practice all good," "Love others as yourself, do not harm each other."
    For people in the world, nothing is more important than the safety of life, peaceful labor, and a happy life. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have achieved such victory today after more than thirty years of arduous struggle, enabling all ethnic groups in the country to break free from the chains of imperialism and feudalism, living in a large family of equality, unity, friendship, and cooperation, engaging in the peaceful construction of their motherland, and working tirelessly with the people of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries for the progress of human society and the defense of world peace.
    However, the aggressive bloc headed by American imperialists, in order to realize their vicious conspiracy to plunder and enslave the people of other countries, establishes military bases everywhere, organizes aggressive blocs under the name of "defense," and engages in aggressive activities. Particularly intolerable is that the United States, like a jackal, occupied our territory of Taiwan in 1950 and recently colluded with the traitor Chiang Kai-shek, who was spurned by the Chinese people, to sign some kind of US-Chiang "joint defense treaty," obstructing us from liberating our own territory of Taiwan and creating tension in Asia. When these sinful activities of theirs met with the angry resistance of the Chinese people and all peace-loving people, they became enraged and clamored for the use of atomic weapons and the launching of atomic war. They only think of building their own joy on the pain of others, without considering the taste of suffering when it comes upon themselves, and they do not understand the principle that those who play with fire will burn themselves, and those who do evil will reap their own consequences. All of us upright Buddhists will never give the slightest sympathy to this kind of sinful behavior that harms others and benefits oneself for thousands of generations. We welcome the peaceful use of atomic energy by countries like the Soviet Union to benefit the people, and oppose any use of human wisdom for the most barbaric behavior. For justice, for peace, for the conscience of humanity, we firmly support and respond to the call of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, we will use our prayers and united efforts to launch a signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons, and strive to oppose American aggression, support the liberation of Taiwan, and defend world peace.

    为了和平，为了人类的良心
    中国佛教协会代理会长　喜饶嘉错
    为了保卫世界的持久和平，世界和平理事会常务委员会于最近发出了“告全世界人民书”，号召全世界人民开展反对使用原子武器的签名运动。这个号召代表了人类的良心和全世界爱好和平的人民的共同愿望，也符合佛陀救世救人的宗旨。佛陀教导我们要：“诸恶莫作，众善奉行”，“爱人如己，勿相残害”。
    人们在世界上，没有比生命的安全、和平的劳动和幸福的生活更重要的了。中国人民在中国共产党领导下，经过三十多年来的艰苦斗争，才获得了今天这样的胜利，使全国各族人民摆脱了帝国主义和封建主义的锁链，生活在平等、团结、友爱、合作的大家庭里，从事自己祖国的和平建设，并与苏联及其他各兄弟国家的人民一道，为人类社会的进步和保卫世界和平而作着不懈的努力。
    但是，以美国帝国主义者为首的侵略集团，为了实现他们掠夺、奴役他国人民的恶毒阴谋，到处建立军事基地，借“防御”之名组织侵略集团，进行侵略活动。特别不可容忍的是，美国在一九五○年就像豺狼一样地侵占了我国领土台湾，最近又勾结被我国人民唾弃了的蒋介石卖国贼，签订了什么美蒋“共同防御条约”，阻挠我们解放自己的领土台湾，制造亚洲的紧张局势。当他们的这些罪恶活动遭到了中国人民和全体爱好和平人民的愤怒反抗的时候，竟恼羞成怒地叫嚷使用原子武器，发动原子战争。他们只想到把自己的喜乐建筑在别人的痛苦上，而未考虑到当痛苦降临到自己头上的时候的滋味，他们也不知道玩火者会自烧其身，作恶者会自食其果的道理。我们所有正直的佛教徒，对这种害人利己的罪恶行为，千年万代也不会给以丝毫同情的。我们欢迎像苏联那样把原子能用于造福于人民的和平用途，反对任何把人类的智慧用于最野蛮的行为上。为了正义，为了和平，为了人类的良心，我们坚决拥护和响应世界和平理事会常务委员会的号召，在中国共产党领导下，用我们的祈祷和团结一致，开展关于反对使用原子武器的签名运动，为反对美国侵略，支援解放台湾，保卫世界和平而努力。
