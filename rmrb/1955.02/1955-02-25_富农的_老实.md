    The "Honesty" of Rich Peasants
    Yang Ye

    "Rich peasants have good livestock, good farm tools, are good at management, have skills, can write and calculate; it is beneficial to absorb them into agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams."
    "Rich peasants are obedient, don't need loans, don't need grain supplies, arrive quickly for meetings, and do whatever they are told."
    "Rich peasants have already been weakened, don't dare to act recklessly, are becoming more and more honest, and are not dangerous."

    Such arguments are still prevalent among some rural work cadres.

    Some comrades know "theoretically" that rich peasants are an exploiting class, and know "politically" that the rich peasant economy should be restricted and gradually eliminated; however, when faced with certain rich peasant elements, they become confused again. Especially when rich peasants put on a facade of "honesty," "activeness," or even "pitifulness," some comrades "cannot see anything wrong with rich peasants."

    Are rich peasants really "becoming more and more honest" and "not dangerous"? Let's tear off that layer of "honest" veneer and see their true colors!

    In Laijiashan Village, Nanzheng County, Shaanxi Province, there was a rich peasant named Leng Bingkun, who had served as a clerk in the puppet township government before liberation and was very good at throwing his weight around in the village. After liberation, especially after the land reform, the fierce look on his face suddenly disappeared. When he saw village cadres, he always bowed three times, bent over twice, offered cigarettes, meals, tea, and wine. He knew that public grain was unavoidable and paid it very early every year. Since the village cadres were illiterate, he "enthusiastically" helped them write booklets and use the abacus. Village chief Zhao Rucai said: Leng Bingkun is "not bad," "honest"! Leng Bingkun also had a set of tricks for mutual aid team members: paying wages in advance, raising wages, providing good food and drink, inviting them to see operas in Hanzhong city, lending money, and lending grain. As a result, no matter how busy the farm work was, the work in Leng Bingkun's fields was always done earlier than the work in the mutual aid team members' own fields. And the result? The mutual aid team was torn apart and fell apart. When the unified purchase and sale of grain began, Leng Bingkun invited two appraisers to his home for wine and meat, concealing more than six dan of surplus grain. The village chief knew about this but was embarrassed to question it; "he who eats another's food speaks softly"! Leng Bingkun knew that after buying off the village cadres and dismantling the mutual aid team, he could safely exploit everyone again.

    It is impossible to imagine that rich peasants would thank us when we restrict and gradually eliminate the rich peasant economy; nor is it possible to imagine that rich peasants would openly confront the people when the socialist momentum is getting stronger and the agricultural cooperation movement is rising higher. They will not now shout "Oppose socialism," "Oppose unified purchase and sale," and "Oppose cooperativization" in front of us. Rich peasants are indeed "good at management" and "good at calculation," but they will never sincerely manage and calculate for the peasant masses. What they are now "managing" and "calculating" in their hearts is: they would rather wear a docile mask, temporarily "give up exploitation," and even dip into their "old capital," including sacrificing their own daughters, to buy off rural cadres and dismantle the platform of the mutual aid and cooperation movement; then, show their true colors and comfortably live a life of not working for a living or earning more with less work, exploiting others.

    Let them dream on! The working class is not asleep, and the peasant brothers are even less fools! Under the leadership of the Party, rural cadres and peasant masses in many places have already exposed the ugly faces of rich peasant elements like Leng Bingkun. After the masses recognized the faces of the rich peasants, the local mutual aid and cooperation movement developed even further, and the poor and middle peasants united more firmly. The masses said to the rich peasants: "You are you, I am I, the peasants don't work together with you exploiters!"

    Comrades who are still being misled by the superficial "honesty" and "amiability" of rich peasants, wake up!

### 富农的“老实”

    富农的“老实”
    杨叶
    “富农牲口好，农具好，会经营，有技术，会写会算；把他们吸收到农业生产合作社和互助组里有好处。”
    “富农又听话，又不要贷款，又不要供应粮，开会到得快，叫他做啥他就做啥。”
    “富农已经削弱了，不敢乱动了，越来越老实了，没有什么危险了。”
    诸如此类的论调，在一部分农村工作干部中间仍然流行着。
    有些同志从“理论上”知道富农是剥削阶级，从“政策上”知道对富农经济是要限制和逐步消灭的；可是，面对着某些富农分子，就又迷迷糊糊起来了。特别是当富农装出一副“老实”“积极”、甚至是“可怜”样子的时候，有些同志就“看不出富农有什么不好”了。
    富农真的“越来越老实”，“没有什么危险”了吗？我们把他们那一层裱糊上去的“老实”面皮扯掉，看看他们的本相吧！
    陕西省南郑县赖家山村有个富农叫冷秉坤，解放前曾经做过伪乡公所的文书，在村子里是很会抖威风的。解放以后，特别是土地改革以后，他脸上的一副凶相忽然消失了，见了村干部，总是三点头、两哈腰、请抽烟、请吃饭、请喝茶、请喝酒。他知道公粮自然是躲不过的，年年交得很早。村干部不识字，他就“热心”地帮他们写册子、打算盘。村长赵儒才说：冷秉坤这个人“还不错”，“老实”！冷秉坤对互助组员也有一套妙计：提前付工资，提高工价，弄好的吃喝，请到汉中城里看戏，借给钱，借给粮食。于是，不管农活多么忙，冷秉坤地里的活都要比互助组员自己地里的活弄得早。结果呢？互助组被弄得七零八落，不成个组了。粮食统购统销开始了，冷秉坤把两个评议员请到家里喝酒吃肉，隐瞒了六石多余粮。村长知道这件事，也不好意思追问；“吃了人家的嘴软”啊！冷秉坤知道，把村干部收买住了，把互助组弄垮以后，他就可以放心地再剥削大家了。
    不可能设想，要限制和逐步消灭富农经济的时候，富农竟会感谢我们；也不可能设想，当社会主义的声势越来越大的时候，当农业合作化运动越来越高涨的时候，富农会明目张胆地和人民对抗。他们现在是不会当着我们的面喊“反对社会主义”“反对统购统销”“反对合作化”的。富农确实是
  “会经营”“会计算”的，可是他们决不会真心为农民群众来经营、计算。他们现在心里“经营”“计算”的是：宁可带上温驯的假面具，暂时“放弃剥削”，甚至贴上“老本”，包括赔上自己的女儿，把农村干部收买住，拆了互助合作运动的台；然后，拿出本来的面目，舒舒服服地再过不劳而食或者少劳多得的剥削生活。
    让他们做白日梦去吧！工人阶级并没有睡觉，农民弟兄更不是傻瓜！在党的领导下，许多地方的农村干部和农民群众已经把冷秉坤之类富农分子的丑脸揭穿了。群众认清了富农的面孔以后，当地的互助合作运动就更加发展了，贫农和中农更巩固地团结起来了。群众对富农说：“你是你，我是我，农民不跟你剥削者打伙！”
    至今仍然被富农的表面的“老实”“和气”迷惑着的同志们，警醒吧！
