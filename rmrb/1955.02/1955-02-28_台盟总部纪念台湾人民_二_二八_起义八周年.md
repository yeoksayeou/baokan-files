Xinhua News Agency, February 27th: The headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League convened a symposium in Beijing on the afternoon of February 27th with members of the League to commemorate the 8th anniversary of the "February 28th" Uprising of the Taiwanese people.

    The symposium was presided over by Xie Xuehong, Chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League. In her speech, she pointed out that the "February 28th" Uprising was a patriotic struggle of the Taiwanese people against the aggression of American imperialism and the dictatorial rule of Chiang Kai-shek. Vice Chairman Li Chunqing reported on the current situation at the meeting. He said: Taiwan is our Chinese territory, and we must liberate Taiwan. American imperialism's attempt to threaten us with atomic bombs to liberate Taiwan will not scare the Chinese people. We also resolutely oppose the so-called "trusteeship" of Taiwan, Taiwan's "neutrality," and the conspiracy to create "two Chinas," which is actually helping American imperialism invade Taiwan and divide our country's territory. We are advancing towards the road of liberating Taiwan, and with the efforts of the people of the whole country, Taiwan will surely be liberated.

    Tian Fuda, Yang Chunsong, Chen Bingji, and six others spoke at the symposium. They angrily denounced the American imperialist aggression against Taiwan and firmly expressed their determination to do their jobs well and strive for the early liberation of Taiwan.

    台盟总部纪念台湾人民“二·二八”起义八周年
    【新华社二十七日讯】台湾民主自治同盟总部二十七日下午召集在北京的盟员举行座谈会，纪念台湾人民“二·二八”起义八周年。
    座谈会由台湾民主自治同盟主席谢雪红主持，她在致词中指出：“二·二八”起义是台湾人民反对美帝国主义侵略和蒋介石独裁统治的爱国主义的斗争。副主席李纯青在会上报告了目前的形势。他说：台湾是我们中国的领土，我们一定要解放台湾，美帝国主义企图用原子弹来威胁我们解放台湾，这是吓不倒中国人民的。我们也坚决反对所谓“托管”台湾、台湾“中立”和搞什么“两个中国”的阴谋，这实际上是帮助美帝国主义侵略台湾，分割我国的领土。我们正在向着解放台湾的道路上前进，在全国人民的努力下，台湾一定会解放的。
    在座谈会上发言的有田富达、杨春松、陈炳基等九人。他们愤怒地斥责了美帝国主义侵略台湾，并坚决表示要做好本岗位工作，争取早日解放台湾。
