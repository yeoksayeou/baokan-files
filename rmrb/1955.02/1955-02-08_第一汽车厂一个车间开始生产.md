A workshop of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant has started production on January 30th. This is one of the first workshops of the plant to be put into production.

This workshop will supply the entire plant with fixtures, guides, motorized tools needed by various basic workshops within the factory, and die-casting mold tools, etc. This first batch of production starts with fixtures and guides, accumulating experience from the production process of these machine tools, and gradually transitioning to full-scale production.

The workshop's employees mostly come from Shanghai, Jinan, Wuhan, Shenyang, Dalian, and other places. Some of them are veteran workers with 15 to 20 years of service, and some have served as production team leaders in their original units or have won the titles of labor model or advanced producer.

Before starting work, the workers all studied at technical schools and, with the help of Soviet experts, prepared work plans, inspected components, and made various preparations. After starting work, a labor competition with technological innovation and "civilized production" as the main content will be launched.

    第一汽车厂一个车间开始生产
    第一汽车制造厂工具二车间已在一月三十日开始生产。这是该厂首批投入生产的一个车间。
    这个车间将供应全厂的夹具、导具、厂内各基本车间所需用的机动工具和压铸模工具等。这次第一批投入生产是从夹具、导具开始，从这几台机床生产过程中摸索经验，逐步转入全面开工生产。
    车间职工大部来自上海、济南、武汉、沈阳、旅大等地，其中有些同志是有十五年到二十年工龄的老工人，有些在原单位曾做过生产组长或得过劳动模范或先进生产者的称号。
    开工前，工人们都在技工学校学习过，并在苏联专家帮助下编制了作业计划，检查了部件，做好了各项准备工作。开工后，将开展以技术革新和“文明生产”为主要内容的劳动竞赛。
