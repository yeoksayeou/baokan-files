Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 25th: The Korean Central News Agency, Pyongyang, February 25th, reports: DPRK Foreign Minister Nam Il issued a statement on relations with Japan on February 25th. The full text is as follows:

Statement by the Foreign Minister of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea Regarding the Relations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea with Japan

The people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea express deep sympathy for the people of Japan, who are still in a state of semi-occupation. They express warm support and solidarity for the efforts of the Japanese people to develop their peaceful economy and national culture, to free themselves from foreign rule, to pursue their independent foreign policy, and to restore and develop normal relations with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other Asian neighbors.

In the past, the Korean people fought against the Japanese imperialist occupation of Korea and the use of Korea as a springboard for aggressive actions to establish dominance in Asia. Today, the Korean people are also fighting against the war policy of the US government, which attempts to rearm Japan and revive Japanese militarism in order to turn Japan into its strategic base for launching aggression in Asia and to use the Japanese people for new military adventures.

However, the Korean and Japanese peoples, who hope to defend the stability and peace of Asia and the friendly relations between the peoples of all countries and oppose such acts of aggression and war policies, have always maintained friendly relations with each other.

Based on the principle that all countries with different social systems can coexist peacefully, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has always been willing to establish normal relations with all countries that have expressed their willingness to establish friendly relations with our country, and has always been willing to establish mutually beneficial trade and cultural relations first.

The establishment of the above-mentioned relations between Japan and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea not only conforms to the fundamental interests of the Korean and Japanese peoples, but will also greatly contribute to safeguarding peace in the Far East and easing international tensions.

The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea announces that it agrees with the recent statement by Japanese Prime Minister Ichiro Hatoyama expressing his willingness to hold negotiations and improve economic relations with our Republic, and is prepared to discuss with the Japanese government the establishment and development of trade and cultural relations, as well as other relations between Korea and Japan.
