Guizhou Province afforested over 190,000 mu from last October to mid-January this year, expanding the winter afforestation area by three times compared to 1953. In afforestation, various regions implemented the principle of "managing planting, managing survival, and managing forest formation," paying attention to protecting seedlings. Farmers in Sanhuan Village, Tieshan Township, Tianzhu County, promptly inserted stakes crosswise between the seedlings after planting them and covered them with grass to protect their growth. Zhenyuan, Jinping, Jianhe, Tianzhu and other counties have established nearly two hundred forest protection and fire prevention committees and forest protection groups. Zhenyuan Prefecture has also established six forestry work stations. According to inspections, the survival rate of seedlings planted in Jianhe County last November is generally over 95%. Mutual aid and cooperation organizations have demonstrated a huge role in afforestation. Ninety percent of the province's afforestation is done through mutual aid and cooperation. Last winter, four agricultural producers' cooperatives in Liubao Township, Jianhe County, planted more than 120,000 trees, averaging over 700 trees per person. In order to meet the need for a large supply of timber forest for construction, the Guizhou Provincial Forestry Bureau purchased 80,000 jin of Pinus armandii seeds from Yunnan in mid-January. These were transported to 23 counties (cities), including Bijie and Zunyi, suitable for planting Pinus armandii. The seeds were distributed free of charge by the counties and cities to the masses for planting, and it is estimated that they can afforest 80,000 mu after they become seedlings.

    贵州冬季造林十九万余亩
    贵州省自去年十月到今年一月中旬，共造林十九万余亩，比一九五三年冬季造林面积扩大三倍。各地在造林中贯彻“管栽、管活、管成林”的原则。注意了保护树苗。天柱县铁山乡三环村农民将树苗栽下后，及时在树苗间交叉插桩，盖上草，保护树苗生长。镇远、锦屏、剑河、天柱等县已建立护林防火委员会、护林小组近二百个，镇远专区还建立林业工作站六个，剑河县去年十一月栽种的树苗，据检查成活率一般在百分之九十五以上。互助合作组织在造林工作中更显示了巨大的作用。全省百分之九十是互助合作造林，剑河县柳堡乡四个农业生产合作社去年冬季共植树十二万多株，平均每人植树七百棵以上，贵州省林业局为供应大量营造用材林需要，于一月中旬由云南购进八万斤华山松种子。分运适宜于种植华山松的毕节、遵义等二十三县（市）。这批种子由各县、市无偿分配给造林群众种植，估计成苗后可造林八万亩。
