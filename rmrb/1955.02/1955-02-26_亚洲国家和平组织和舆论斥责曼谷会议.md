Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace
Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, February 25th: Rangoon newspapers published a statement issued by the Burmese Committee for the Defense of World Peace on the 17th, denouncing the Bangkok Conference of the Manila Treaty nations.

The statement said: The aggressive nature of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is becoming more and more obvious. This organization is planning at the Bangkok Conference to strengthen the deployment of aggressive forces, establish military bases near southern China, and station armed aggressor troops in Malaya. The statement pointed out that these military deployments by U.S. and British imperialists endanger peace in the Southeast Asian region.

The statement said: The people of Burma love peace. For the sake of national independence, sovereignty, and the preservation of peace, they will spare no sacrifice in striving to shatter the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, which is an instrument of U.S. and British imperialist aggression.

Burmese "Rangoon Daily" and "Tun Daily"
Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, February 25th: Burmese newspapers "Rangoon Daily" and "Tun Daily" published commentaries denouncing the Bangkok Conference.

    The "Rangoon Daily" said that it is laughable that the Manila Treaty nations "want to discuss the 'security' of Southeast Asia in the name of 'Southeast Asian countries.' In fact, the so-called Southeast Asia Defense Treaty is only a tool for the United States to invade Asia, and the so-called 'security' of the Southeast Asian region is the United States creating wars in Southeast Asia in order to seize profits. Therefore, all countries that have not joined the Southeast Asia Treaty must rise up together to oppose the United States' conspiracy to create wars in this region and alienate the feelings of Southeast Asian countries, especially the attempt to drag these countries into a war of aggression against New China." The newspaper also said, "The United States' conspiracy is to use money to buy Asians to fight Asians. The rulers of Thailand and the Philippines are driving the youth of their countries to their deaths, but the people of these countries should recognize that their bloodshed is not for their own countries, but for the interests of the United States."

    The "Tun Daily" published a commentary on the 23rd, saying: "It is not difficult to see the true purpose of the conference from the speech of Thai Prime Minister Pibul Songgram at the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization conference. Pibul Songgram's anti-communist clamor is clearing the way for the United States and Britain to launch a war of aggression in the Southeast Asian region in the future."

"The Times of India" and "Amrita Bazar Patrika"
Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 25th: Indian newspapers commented on the Manila Treaty nations' meeting in Bangkok. "The Times of India" published an editorial on the 24th, criticizing the United States for exerting pressure on the signatories of the Manila Treaty in order to establish an aggressive military organization under American control, modeled on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, through the Bangkok Conference. The editorial said, "The Manila Treaty is a blatant expression of disregarding Asian opinion." The editorial pointed out that the Manila Treaty will never win the support of Asia.

    "Amrita Bazar Patrika" published an editorial on the 23rd, saying that India has ample reason to criticize military treaties. In a period of twelve months, Asia has already had three military treaties - the first is the treaty signed between the United States and Pakistan, the second is the Manila Treaty, and the third is the US-Chiang Treaty. The editorial said: These treaties are provocative in nature.
  "They do not solve any problems and create disputes where there are none. They bring the Cold War, and the Cold War and hot war are sometimes only one step apart."

    亚洲国家和平组织和舆论斥责曼谷会议
    缅甸保卫世界和平委员会
    【新华社二十五日讯】仰光消息：仰光报纸刊载了缅甸保卫世界和平委员会十七日发表的声明，斥责马尼拉条约国家曼谷会议。
    声明说：东南亚条约组织的侵略性已经一天比一天明显。这个组织正打算在曼谷会议上策划加强侵略军队的部署，在靠近中国南部的地方设立军事基地，并在马来亚驻扎武装侵略部队。声明指出，美、英帝国主义者的这些军事部署危害了东南亚地区的和平。
    声明说：缅甸人民是热爱和平的。为了国家的独立主权和维护和平事业，他们将不惜任何牺牲，为粉碎作为美、英帝国主义侵略工具的东南亚条约组织而努力。
    缅甸“仰光日报”和“吞报”
    【新华社二十五日讯】仰光消息：缅甸“仰光日报”和“吞报”发表评论，斥责曼谷会议。
      “仰光日报”说，马尼拉条约国家“要以‘东南亚国家’名义讨论东南亚的‘安全’问题，真令人生笑。实际上，所谓东南亚防务条约只是美国侵略亚洲的工具，所谓东南亚地区的‘安全’就是美国为了攫取利润在东南亚制造战争。因此，一切未参加东南亚条约的国家，必须大家起来反对美国在这个地区制造战争和离间东南亚国家的感情，特别是想把这些国家拖入侵略新中国的战争的阴谋。”这家报纸又说，“美国的阴谋是用金钱收买亚洲人去打亚洲人。泰国、菲律宾的统治者正驱使他们国家的青年去送死，但是这些国家的人民应该认清他们的流血并不是为了自己的国家，而是为了美国的利益。”
    “吞报”二十三日发表评论说：“从泰国总理銮披汶在东南亚条约国家会议上的演说中不难看出这个会议的真实目的，銮披汶的反共叫嚣正为美英将来在东南亚地区发动侵略战争扫清道路。”
    “印度时报”和“甘露市场报”
    【新华社新德里二十五日电】印度报纸评论马尼拉条约国家在曼谷举行的会议。“印度时报”二十四日发表社论，抨击美国对马尼拉条约签字国施加压力，以便通过曼谷会议，仿照北大西洋公约组织形式成立一个在美国控制下的侵略性的军事组织。社论说，“马尼拉条约是一个忽视亚洲意见的明目张胆的表示”。社论指出，马尼拉条约永远也不会赢得亚洲的支持。
      “甘露市场报”二十三日发表社论说，印度是有充分理由抨击军事条约的。在十二个月的时期中，亚洲已经有了三个军事条约——第一个是美国和巴基斯坦签订的条约，第二个是马尼拉条约，第三个是美蒋条约。社论说：这些条约具有挑衅的性质。
  “它们解决不了任何问题，并且在没有纠纷的地方制造纠纷。它们带来了冷战，而冷战和热战有时只相差一步。”
