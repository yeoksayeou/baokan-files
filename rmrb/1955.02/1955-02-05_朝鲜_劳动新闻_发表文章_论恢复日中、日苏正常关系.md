Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, February 4th: "Rodong Sinmun" of Korea published an article on the 3rd entitled "Japan's Road," commenting on the legitimate demands of the Japanese people to restore diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union.

The article stated: The Soviet government, which has consistently strived to restore normal relations with Japan, once again expressed its attitude on this issue on January 25th through Domnitsky, the head of the Soviet delegation in Tokyo.

This is of great significance for changing the current situation in which Japan finds itself and promoting peace in Asia.

The article continued: Restoring normal relations with the Soviet Union and China is a long-cherished desire of the Japanese people.

The article said that the American policy of militarizing the Japanese economy and prohibiting Japanese trade with the Soviet Union and China has completely destroyed Japan's civilian industry and plunged the vast majority of working people into extreme poverty and unemployment.

This series of grim facts shows that Japan can no longer tolerate the current situation.

The article continued: Such a situation has caused great unease and fear among the American ruling clique. They are now conducting unfounded slander and defamation against the repeated efforts of the Soviet Union and China, while exerting pressure and coercion on the Japanese government.

The article concluded: However, no threat from the American ruling clique can trample on the Japanese people's firm demand to restore normal relations with their neighbors in order to get rid of the abnormal situation facing Japan today and the serious situation arising therefrom.

Today, this strong desire of the Japanese people has formed a powerful political force.

The just struggle of the Japanese people, resolutely supported by the great Soviet Union, China, and peace-loving people all over the world, will surely be victorious.

    论恢复日中、日苏正常关系
    【新华社讯】据朝鲜中央通讯社平壤四日电：“劳动新闻”三日刊载了一篇题为“日本的道路”的文章，评论日本人民希望同中苏两国恢复外交关系的正当要求。
    文章说：一贯努力于同日本恢复正常关系的苏联政府，已经在一月二十五日通过苏联驻东京的代表团团长多穆尼茨基，再次表明了它对这个问题的态度。
    这对于改变目前日本所处的情况和促进亚洲和平，具有重大的意义。
    文章接着说：同苏联和中国恢复正常的关系是日本人民长期以来所怀抱的愿望。
    文章说，美国使日本经济军事化和禁止日本同苏联及中国贸易的政策，已完全破坏了日本的民用工业，并使广大的劳动人民陷于极端贫困和失业的状态。
    这一系列冷酷的事实表明，日本不能够再容忍目前的情况了。
    文章继续说：这样一种形势引起了美国统治集团的极大不安和疑惧。他们现在正对苏联和中国的一再努力，进行毫无根据的诽谤和中伤，同时对日本政府施加压力和胁迫。
    文章最后指出：但是，美国统治集团的任何威胁都不能践踏日本人民为了摆脱日本今天所面临的不正常情况和因此产生严重局势而提出同他们的邻国恢复正常关系的坚决要求。
    今天，日本人民的这种强烈愿望已经形成为一种强大的政治力量。
    受到伟大的苏联、中国和全世界爱好和平人民坚决支持的日本人民的正义斗争，将一定会获得胜利。
