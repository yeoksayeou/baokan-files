To the Reader:

You asked: Why did the World Peace Council issue a call for signatures at this time? Mingguang Comrade:

In the "Appeal to the People of the World," the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council pointed out: "Today, the governments of some countries are preparing to launch an atomic war. They are trying to convince the people of all countries that atomic war is inevitable."

As everyone knows, ever since the United States dropped the first atomic bomb on Japan, warmongers in the American ruling clique have been constantly engaging in atomic weapons intimidation and blackmail. The recent situation has seen new developments. While many politicians, congressmen, and officials have repeatedly clamored for the use of atomic weapons, the governments of Western countries, led by the United States, are stepping up their preparations for engaging in atomic war. Last December, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council passed a resolution approving plans for atomic warfare in Europe. Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak revealed after the meeting that the military "demanded permission to prepare for atomic warfare. As a result, they have obtained this permission." Not long ago, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower suggested to Congress to expand the air force for atomic bombing at a cost of more than $14.5 billion. He also openly stated that the United States would develop and use "new weapons, especially weapons with rapid and devastating offensive power," and would list atomic weapons as regular weapons of the U.S. military, just like cannons and machine guns.

The United States' sinister plan to prepare for atomic war is also linked to its schemes to rearm West Germany in Europe, create tension in the Far East, and invade our country. The United States has decided to hand over atomic and hydrogen weapons to yesterday's Hitlerian troops, who are trying to launch a war of revenge. The U.S. military announced that the Seventh Fleet, which has invaded our territorial waters, already possesses atomic weapons and will use them if necessary.

These circumstances show that the activities of the enemies of peace have entered a new and more adventurous stage; they are no longer limited to clamoring for atomic war, but are openly agreeing and preparing to use atomic weapons. This is, of course, a major threat to the cause of world peace and the safety of the people of all countries.

In this situation, it is very necessary and timely for the World Peace Council to launch a signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons. The purpose of this movement is to thoroughly expose the criminal conspiracy of U.S. imperialism, which violates the conscience and interests of mankind, to the people of the world, to make everyone clearly aware of the current threat of atomic war, and to mobilize everyone to use the powerful moral and public opinion forces to block the road of imperialism to launch atomic war.

Although the forces of aggression and war are becoming increasingly rampant and adventurous, the forces of peace are stronger than the forces of aggression and war.

We have sufficient understanding of the serious threat posed by the U.S. aggressive bloc's preparations for atomic war, but we will never be intimidated by this threat. We do not ignore the enormous destructive power of atomic weapons, but we understand even more clearly the power of the people. Chairman Mao said as early as 1946: "The atomic bomb looks terrible, but in reality it is not terrible at all. The real power does not lie with the reactionaries, but with the people." Moreover, the United States is no longer the monopolist of atomic weapons, and it does not even have an advantage in this area. Comrade Molotov, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, recently declared at the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union that the Soviet Union's achievements in hydrogen weapons have left the United States behind. It is clear that if imperialism launches an atomic war, it will be destroyed itself.

We are not afraid of the threat of atomic war, and we must resolutely liberate our territory of Taiwan, oppose the aggressive crimes of the United States, and oppose the criminal conspiracy of imperialism to prepare for atomic war. We oppose imperialism's preparations for atomic war in order to defend the peace, security, and vital interests of the people of the world. We cherish the peaceful life we have gained through bloody struggle today. We will never allow the poisonous hands of atomic madmen to reach into our happy paradise to destroy the fruits of our people's labor. At the same time, we also want the hundreds of millions of people all over the world to be able to live in peace. We demand peace and progress, and oppose war and destruction. Therefore, we wholeheartedly support the Soviet Union's just proposal to use atomic energy for the benefit of mankind, and resolutely oppose the evil attempt of imperialism to use atomic weapons to slaughter mankind. Only by prohibiting the use and production of atomic weapons can the peaceful use of atomic energy be developed on a large scale and rapidly.

We have the unity of the great Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, and the sympathy and support of the peace-loving people and countries all over the world. We have the power to stop the conspiracy of atomic madmen.

It must be recognized: the significance and role of the signature movement is enormous.

Carrying out a signature campaign around the world is one of the effective ways for the people to fight against the imperialists' plot of atomic war. A signature is a solemn warning to imperialism and a demonstration of the determination to defend peace. The will of hundreds of millions of people is an irresistible force. If the people remain silent or show weakness towards the evil plans of the enemies of peace, it will fall right into the trap of the imperialists and will help them to become even bolder and more reckless. Conversely, if the eyes of the people of the world are fixed on them and their hands are pointing at them, imperialism will fall into complete isolation and will have to be more honest and sober. Everyone still remembers that in the Korean War and the Indochina War, the American generals also clamored more than once to use atomic weapons. But they were not able to do so later. If they encountered difficulties, these difficulties were the just power of the people of the world. Because imperialism cannot but take into account the firm will expressed by more than 500 million people in the Stockholm Appeal and the voices of protests against the clamor of American generals all over the world. If the signature campaign five years ago played a certain limiting role for the imperialist aggressors, then today, five years later, a more extensive signature campaign can prevent the evil conspiracies of the enemies of peace. It must be known that although imperialism's steps to prepare for atomic war have accelerated more than before, the power of the people to rise up to stop this war is also stronger than before. The great defender of peace, Stalin, said long ago: If the people of all countries take on the cause of safeguarding peace and defend this cause to the end, peace can be maintained and consolidated. If the war-mongers can succeed in trapping the masses of the people with a web of lies, deceiving the masses of the people, and dragging the masses of the people into another world war, then war may become inevitable.

Therefore, we must widely carry out the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons. Make this movement deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, so that people of the whole country, regardless of men and women, old and young, regardless of occupation and belief, will participate in the signature. Let everyone know that every signature is a force. The signatures of hundreds of millions of people in China are a serious blow to imperialism and a huge support for the forces of world peace.

### 为什么要开展反对使用原子武器的签名运动？

    为什么要开展反对使用原子武器的签名运动？明光同志：
    您问道：为什么世界和平理事会要在这个时候发出签名的号召？
    在“告全世界人民书”中，世界和平理事会常务委员会这样指出：“今天有一些国家的政府正在准备发动原子战争。它们正在竭力使各国人民相信原子战争是不可避免的。”
    大家知道，自从美国在日本投下第一颗原子弹以来，美国统治集团中的好战分子，一直就在不断地进行原子武器的恫吓和讹诈。最近的情况有了新的发展。在许多政客、议员和官方人士反复叫嚣使用原子武器的同时，以美国为首的西方国家的政府，正在加紧地进行从事原子战争的准备工作。去年十二月，北大西洋联盟理事会通过了决议，批准在欧洲进行原子战争的计划。比利时的外交部长斯巴克在会后透露说：军人们“要求允许准备原子战争。结果他们已得到了这种允许”。不久以前美国总统艾森豪威尔建议国会以一百四十五亿多美元来扩充进行原子轰炸的空军力量。他并且公开表示，美国要发展和使用“新武器，特别是具有迅速和毁灭性的攻击力量的武器”，并且要把原子武器同大炮、机关枪一样列为美国军队的常备武器。
    美国准备原子战争的罪恶计划，又是同它在欧洲重新武装西德、在远东制造紧张局势和侵略我国的阴谋相联系的。美国已经决定要把原子武器和氢武器交给力图发动复仇战争的昨天的希特勒军队。美国军方宣布，侵占我国领海的第七舰队已经拥有原子武器，并将在必要时加以使用。
    这些情况说明：和平敌人的活动已经进入了一个新的、更冒险的阶段；他们已经不是局限在叫嚣原子战争，而是在公开协议和准备使用原子武器了。这当然是对于世界和平事业和各国人民安全的重大威胁。
    在这种情况下，世界和平理事会发出开展反对使用原子武器的签名运动就显得十分必要和适时了。这个运动的目的就是要在全世界人民面前彻底揭露美帝国主义这种违反人类的良心和利益的罪恶阴谋，让每一个人都清楚地认识到当前的原子战争的威胁，使大家都动员起来，用强大的道义和舆论的力量来堵塞住帝国主义发动原子战争的道路。
    侵略和战争的势力虽然日益猖獗和冒险，但是和平的力量比侵略和战争的势力更为强大。
    我们对当前美国侵略集团准备进行原子战争的严重威胁有足够的认识，但是我们绝不会被这种威胁所吓倒。我们并不忽视原子武器的巨大破坏力，但是我们更清楚地懂得人民的力量。毛主席早在一九四六年就说过：“原子弹看样子可怕，实在并不可怕。真正的力量不在于反动派，而在于人民”。而且，现在美国不仅已经不是原子武器的垄断者，甚至它连这方面的优势也不存在了。苏联部长会议第一副主席兼外交部长莫洛托夫同志最近在苏联最高苏维埃会议上宣称：苏联在氢武器方面的成就已经使美国落在后面了。很显然，如果帝国主义发动原子战争，那末灭亡的将是它们自己。
    我们并不害怕原子战争的威胁，我们一定要坚决解放我国的领土台湾，反对美国的侵略罪行，反对帝国主义准备原子战争的罪恶阴谋。我们反对帝国主义准备原子战争，是为了保卫世界人民的和平安全和切身利益。我们热爱自己用流血斗争得来的今天的和平生活。我们决不容许原子狂人的毒手伸进我们幸福的乐园里来破坏我国人民劳动的成果。同时，我们也愿意全世界千千万万人民都能够过安宁的生活。我们要求的是和平与进步，反对的是战争与破坏。因此我们竭力拥护苏联所提出的把原子能用来造福人类的正义主张，而坚决反对帝国主义用原子武器来屠杀人类的罪恶企图。也只有禁止使用和生产原子武器，才能使原子能的和平利用得到大规模的、迅速的发展。
    我们有伟大苏联和各人民民主国家的团结一致，有全世界爱好和平的人民和国家的同情和支持，我们是有力量来制止原子狂人的阴谋企图的。
    必须认识：签名运动意义和作用是巨大的。
    在全世界开展签名运动，就是人民反对帝国主义策划原子战争的有效的斗争方式之一。签名就是对帝国主义的严正警告，就是保卫和平的决心的表现。千千万万人民的意志是一股不可抗拒的强大力量。如果人民对和平敌人的罪恶计划保持缄默或表现软弱，那就恰好中了帝国主义者的奸计，就会助长他们更加大胆妄为了。反之，如果全世界人民的眼睛都盯着他们，手都指着他们，帝国主义就会陷于完全的孤立，就不能不老实一些，清醒一些。大家都还记得，在朝鲜战争和印度支那战争中，美国的将军也曾不止一次地叫嚣过要使用原子武器。但他们后来并没有能够这样做。如果说他们碰到了困难的话，这种困难就是全世界人民的正义力量。因为帝国主义不能不考虑到五亿以上人民在斯德哥尔摩宣言上表现出来的坚决意志和世界各地抗议美国将军叫嚣的呼声。如果说五年以前的签名运动曾对帝国主义侵略者起过一定的限制作用，那么，在五年以后的今天，更广泛地展开签名运动，就能够阻遏和平敌人的罪恶阴谋了。要知道，虽然帝国主义准备原子战争的步骤比从前加紧了，但是人民起来制止这种战争的力量比从前也更加强大了。伟大的和平保卫者斯大林早就说过：如果各国人民将维护和平的事业担当起来，并且把这一事业保卫到底，和平就能够保持和巩固。如果战争贩子用谎言的罗网陷害人民群众能够得逞，欺骗了人民群众，将人民群众拖入另一次世界大战之中，那末战争就可能变得不可避免。
    因此，我们一定要广泛地开展反对使用原子武器的签名运动。使这个运动深入人心，使全国人民不分男女老少，不论职业、信仰，都来参加签名。让大家知道，每一个签名就是一分力量。我们全中国几亿人的签名，就是对帝国主义的严重打击，对世界和平力量的巨大支持。             有为
