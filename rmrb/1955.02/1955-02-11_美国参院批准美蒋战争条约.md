Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 10th: The United States Senate hastily approved the US-Chiang "Joint Defense Treaty" on the 9th. Senators Wayne Morse and five others voted against it.

Senator Morse, who voted against the US-Chiang treaty, stated during the discussion that "this document is a military alliance, not a treaty," and that it commits the United States to "protect" "a government whose rule is very questionable rather than a country." He expressed concern that the current treaty would increase the risk of the United States being drawn into a major war and would lead Asians to believe that the United States was pursuing a policy of hegemony in Asia. Another senator who voted against, Kefauver, said, "I do not agree to linking our future with the future of Chiang Kai-shek."

The statements of those senators who favored the US-Chiang treaty during the discussion further exposed the aggressive and warlike nature of this treaty. Senator George, urging the Senate to immediately approve the treaty, clamored that the United States must occupy China's territory of Taiwan. Wiley said that this treaty was a "real enterprise" for the American cause. During the discussion, an amendment was rejected which supported the US occupation of Chinese Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, but stipulated that the US occupation range should not be extended to "other territories."

    美国参院批准美蒋战争条约
    【新华社十日讯】华盛顿消息：美国参议院九日匆匆批准了美蒋“共同防御条约”。韦·莫尔斯等六个参议员投票反对。
    投票反对美蒋条约的参议员莫尔斯在讨论中发言说，“这个文件是一个军事同盟，而不是一个条约”，它使美国要“保护”的是“一个它的统治很成问题的政府而不是一个国家”。他表示担心目前这个条约会增加美国卷入大战的危险，会使亚洲人认为美国在亚洲遵循的方针是独霸。另一位投反对票的参议员克弗维尔说，“我不赞成把我们的前途同蒋介石的前途联系在一起。”
    那些赞成美蒋条约的参议员在讨论中的发言进一步暴露这个条约的侵略性和战争性。参议员乔治催促参议院立即批准这个条约时叫嚣美国必须霸占中国领土台湾。维利说，这个条约是美国事业的一个“实在的企业”。在讨论过程中，否决了一项修正案，这个修正案支持美国侵占中国台湾和澎湖，但规定美国侵占范围不扩大到“其他领土”。
