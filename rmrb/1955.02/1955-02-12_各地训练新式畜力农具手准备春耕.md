Various regions, while vigorously promoting new animal-powered farm implements, are actively training farm implement operators to prepare for spring plowing and production.

Generally, regions are starting by establishing farm implement training classes to cultivate instructors, then training farmer implement operators in batches and areas. Henan Province plans to promote 55,000 double-wheeled, double-bottom plows in 1955. It has already trained 4,811 supply and marketing cooperative, bank, and district and township production cadres, and is currently training 50,000 farmer implement operators, with plans to continue training another 50,000. Henan Province is conducting training in batches at the county level, with 50 people per batch, using hands-on teaching and batch internship methods. Last autumn, Hebei Province held training classes for agricultural production cooperative members in counties promoting more than ten double-wheeled, double-bottom plows. In January of this year, the province trained another 310 farm implement cadres, who, after completing their training, will train farmer implement operators. Last autumn, Beijing's suburbs trained 1,185 district and township cadres and farmer implement operators in six districts and 120 townships. This spring, Heilongjiang Province plans to train more than 48,000 farmer implement operators through agricultural technology extension stations in various locations. This spring, Shanxi Province plans to train 1,000 agricultural technology extension station and supply and marketing cooperative cadres by special district, and then train 40,000 farmer implement operators by county. In addition, Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, and other provinces have also successively held farm implement training classes, cultivated cadres, and are preparing to train a certain number of farmer implement operators based on local promotion tasks. Shaanxi Province has also put forward the slogan "Transmit technology first, then promote farm implements."

While training farm implement operators, some regions are also carrying out farm implement repair work. For example, the Shandong Province Farm Implement Factory is training one technician from each of the province's 128 counties and the iron and woodworking handicraft cooperatives in the suburbs of Jinan and Qingdao in batches to be responsible for the repair and fitting of new animal-powered farm implements. This year, Shaanxi Province plans to establish farm implement repair stations in Weinan, Baoji, Yan'an, and Hanzhong.

    各地训练新式畜力农具手准备春耕
    各地在大量推广新式畜力农具同时，积极训练农具手，为春耕生产作准备。
    各地一般是先从开办农具训练班培养师资着手，然后分批分片训练农民农具手。河南省一九五五年计划推广双轮双铧犁五万五千部，现已训练了供销社、银行及区乡生产干部四千八百一十一人，并正训练农民农具手五万人，还计划继续训练五万人。河南省是以县为单位，分批训练，每批五十人，采取实物教学和分批实习方法。河北省去秋在推广十部双轮双铧犁以上的县都举办了以农业生产合作社社员为对象的训练班，今年一月份该省又训练了农具干部三百一十人，训练完毕后即分别训练农民农具手。北京市郊去秋在六个区、一百二十个乡训练区乡干部和农民农具手一千一百八十五人。黑龙江省今春通过各地农业技术推广站计划再训练四万八千多名农民农具手。山西省今春计划分专区训练农业技术推广站及供销社干部一千人，然后分县训练农民农具手四万人。此外，山东、安徽、江苏等省也先后举办了农具训练班，培养了干部，并根据各地推广任务准备训练一定数量的农民农具手。陕西省并提出“先传技术，后推广农具”的口号。
    在训练农具手同时，有些地区还进行农具修理工作。如山东省农具厂分批抽训全省一百二十八个县和济南、青岛两市郊的铁木手工业合作社的技工各一人，负责新式畜力农具修配工作。陕西省今年计划在渭南、宝鸡、延安、汉中各设农具修配站一处。
