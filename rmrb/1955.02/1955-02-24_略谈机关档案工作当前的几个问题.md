A Brief Discussion of Several Current Problems in Archives Work in Government Agencies
Zēng Sān

The Scope of Archives Work and Its Role in Government Agencies

Archives work is a rather complex and specialized undertaking, with its basic content including six parts: the collection, organization, appraisal, preservation, statistics, and utilization of archival materials. It would be wrong to see it merely as "keeping and guarding" documents, only "playing the role of a lock." The fundamental purpose of archives work is to use or utilize archival materials. If archives work is viewed only as preserving documents, without conducting organization, appraisal, statistics, and collection, there is no way to talk about utilizing archival materials, and such preservation would be meaningless, and it would also be impossible to preserve documents well.

Archives work includes the work of government agency archives and the work of archives. All documents formed in the work of each unit of the government agency (including all state organs, armies and military organs, factories, mines, enterprises, farms, schools, organizations, cooperatives, etc.) should be filed and archived in the government agency archives; archives that need to be permanently preserved by various government agencies should be concentrated in the national archives after a certain number of years. In the archives and archives, a lot of scientific sorting and research work must be carried out to make the archival materials serve the government agency and the country. Such a planned and step-by-step concentration of archival materials will make the entire national archives reflect all aspects of the lives and activities of the people of the country, reflecting the people's political, economic, and cultural conditions, the conditions of production struggles and class struggles, and reflecting the achievements of science, technology, literature, and art; therefore, archives work is not only needed for the work of the government agency, but also needed by the people and the country, and it is not only a part of the work of the government agency, but also a part of our country's scientific work.

With the development of national construction and the needs of various tasks, the work of government agency archives must now be universally and scientifically established. What should government agency archives do and what role should it play in the work of the government agency? According to current understanding, government agency archives at least have the following specific tasks: (1) assisting document processing departments in correctly carrying out filing and archiving; (2) receiving, registering, organizing, preserving, and statistically analyzing archival materials sent by various units of the government agency; (3) compiling catalogs, indexes, topical cards, etc. of archival materials; (4) conducting appraisal work on archival materials, and proposing opinions on the preservation or destruction of archival materials;
(5) managing the access to and lending of archival materials; (6) providing relevant materials from the archives according to the needs of the government agency's work; (7) compiling and printing document compilations according to the instructions of the government agency's leaders; (8) transferring long-term preservation archival materials to designated archives in accordance with regulations;
(9) completing other archives work tasks assigned by the government agency's leaders.

Doing these tasks well in the archives, first, can directly help the work of the government agency. When staff at all levels of the government agency are studying situations, solving problems, or summarizing work, they can access the archives at any time, or ask the archives to provide certain materials. Archives that do a good job can also take the initiative to provide materials for the government agency's work at any time. Second, it can concentrate and preserve the fruits of the people's labor through scientific sorting and appraisal, accumulate historical materials for the government agency and the country, and prepare for various scientific research work. Third, doing these tasks well in the archives, and establishing a complete set of systems, can ensure the security of state secrets; if this set of systems cooperates well with the document processing department, it can also prevent bureaucracy and overcome bureaucratism.

However, some of our comrades do not have a comprehensive understanding of these roles of archives work in the work of the government agency, and even have incorrect views. For example, some comrades think that locking up the archives is the whole of archives work. Some comrades believe that archives work cannot serve today's work of the government agency, and there is no need to put too much effort into sorting, appraising, and statistically analyzing, etc. The former view can be said to be partly reasonable during the war years and the underground party period, because there were not many documents and archives at that time, and there were no better working conditions. But now the situation is completely different. The latter view also only has a partial truth. It is right to require archives work to serve today's work of the government agency; but it uses the past archives to serve today's work of the government agency, so it is necessary to sort out and keep the past archives well in order to play its role. Today's documents must also be well filed and archived in order to make tomorrow's archives work well serve the work of the government agency. If today's archives work cannot serve the work of the government agency well, this can only lead to one conclusion, that the archives has not yet been established and should be started immediately. Some comrades have not yet noticed the above-mentioned second role of archives work in the life of the country. They either think that this point does not belong to their task scope, or think that the work records of their department are not useful for the future and do not need to be preserved for a long time, these ideas are wrong. All archival materials formed by various government agencies, armies, factories, mines, enterprises, farms, schools, organizations, cooperatives... are the wealth of the people of the country, and many parts of them must be permanently preserved by the state in a centralized and unified manner, and any unit has the responsibility to safely and regularly send it to the archives. It is wrong to think that only the archives of central government agencies or senior government agencies need to be preserved, or to look at the problem only from the perspective of one's own unit and think that the archives of one's own unit are not the wealth of the country. Some comrades do not have enough understanding of the third role of archives work. They are only satisfied with the old-fashioned and relatively simple confidentiality system and document system, and do not know that documents and archives accumulate over time, increasing without end, and without a complete and long-term system, they will be out of control. They do not know that our government agency work is becoming increasingly busy, and without a scientific document processing and archives system, it is difficult to strictly maintain state secrets and oppose bureaucracy and bureaucratism.

Current Situation of Archives Work in Government Agencies

Our Party has always attached importance to archives work. As early as 1931, the Central Committee stipulated the "Document Disposal Method." The last sentence of this method said that the documents should be sorted into the library for submission to the Party History Committee after the victory of the revolution in the future. When our archivists read this sentence, they were extremely moved and greatly increased their love for archives work. However, because we were in an underground state and a war environment in the past, and were often persecuted by reactionary forces, the archival materials preserved by our Party and revolutionary regime are still not many after all, and there is no time to create a scientific method of document processing and archives management.

In the five or six years after the victory of the revolution, with the development of work, the number of documents in government agencies has gradually increased, and many government agencies have already begun to establish document processing work and archives work. In 1950, after the advanced archives work theory and experience of the Soviet Union were introduced into our country, many government agencies held archives work meetings, and the Secretariat of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee also created the "Archives Work" magazine. Renmin University of China established an archives training course in 1952 (changed to a specialized course in 1953), established an archives teaching and research section, and with the cordial help of Soviet experts, trained cadres, translated business books, organized on-the-job cadres to conduct business studies, and started to collect materials related to the history of Chinese archives. Undoubtedly, these works have played a role in improving the ideological and professional level of document processing and archives workers, improving archives work in government agencies, and laying the foundation for its future development.

However, on the whole, our work in the past few years is still far behind the needs of actual work. In the past few years, we were still in the stage of exchanging experiences, learning from the Soviet Union, training cadres, and partially improving. Although a few government agencies have made some improvements in document processing and archives work, there is still no unified, scientific, and systematic approach in the country as a whole, and there are still many shortcomings in the document processing work of many government agencies. The document registration and preservation system of some government agencies is not sound, and many documents are missing; the incoming and outgoing documents of many events are separated, making it impossible to correctly carry out filing work; processed documents are still scattered and kept in the hands of the undertaking unit or the undertaker, and are not filed and archived. Most of the archival materials received by the archives of many government agencies are "archived" from the receiving and dispatching department, not from the document processing department; the phenomenon that the document processing department does not file the documents and archives materials in a package and a bundle is very common.

In addition to the fact that document processing work is not sound and the archiving system has not been correctly established, the archives work of government agencies also generally has the following shortcomings: (1) the preserved archives are not complete; (2) the sorting method is not scientific; (3) the appraisal has no standards, and even archival materials are destroyed at will; (4) the archives organization is not sound, and even some government agencies do not have archives at all, but only send one or two comrades to lock up the archives.

Many government agencies deal with and preserve documents separately in various units, so its archives only preserves a part of the documents of the General Office (Office) of the government agency, and it only receives them when they are sent, and does not want them if they are not sent. In fact, it only carries out the filing and preservation of a part of the documents of the government agency, and does not play the role it should play. In this way, not only can the safety of the archives not be guaranteed, but it is also very inconvenient to use the archives.

The methods of sorting out archives are also inconsistent in various government agencies, and many of them still use the decimal library classification method or preserve them according to "gate, category, outline, item", and do not systematically bind them into volumes. Some are only preserved according to the receiving and dispatching document number, and some have no catalog at all. The inconsistent paper and arrangement formats of documents, and the separation of incoming and outgoing documents, have increased the difficulty of sorting work. In the destruction of archival documents, there is no clear standard, and some comrades destroy all the documents they think have no preservation value, which causes many losses. For example, a comrade who manages documents in the Propaganda Department of a municipal party committee thought that the drafts were useless and destroyed all the document drafts accumulated in a year and a half. Another municipal people's government burned 90% of the old archives it received. Many government agencies did not leave a catalog after destroying the archives, so it is impossible to know what was destroyed. In recent years, the practice of destroying documents at will has generally been stopped, but there is no way to deal with the increasing number of documents and archives separately.

Finally, the organization of archives in many government agencies is very unsound, and the quality and quantity of archives workers are insufficient. Some archives workers have too low education level and poor health, and can only do some guarding work. Some archives workers do not have a comprehensive understanding of this work and are not at ease in their work. Some government agencies are unwilling to send appropriate cadres to strengthen this work, or because other work needs people, they transfer skilled archives workers away, so that there are too many cadre transfers and it is difficult to accumulate experience.

The Current Central Task of Archives Work in Government Agencies

The problem that needs to be solved urgently in our country's archives work is how to establish and improve the work of archives in government agencies.

In order to improve the work of archives in government agencies, it is necessary to improve the document processing work of government agencies. The document processing work and archives work of government agencies both belong to the scope of secretarial work. When the work scope of the government agency is small, it can be undertaken by a work department or even a staff member, but now the work scope of each government agency is very large, and these two tasks must be divided and closely cooperated in order to play a better role in the work of the government agency. Sound document processing work not only helps the leadership work of the government agency, but also is a prerequisite for doing a good job in archives work in the government agency. For example, the paper format of documents is not uniform, there is no connection between incoming and outgoing documents, and document processing units do not file documents, etc., which directly affect the establishment and improvement of archives work. Archives workers are concerned about document processing work and have the responsibility to assist document processing departments in filing work. Of course, if the archives has not been established well, it will in turn affect the document processing work. For example, if the method of preserving archives is not scientific, and the leaders of the government agency or the document processing department cannot provide archival materials when they are needed, it will add many difficulties to the work, so the document processing department should also be concerned about the work of the archives in the government agency.

Some people say that the document processing department handles documents and cannot do filing work. This is because they do not know that filing work must become a part of document processing work. When the document processing department finishes handling the documents, it does not take much effort to concentrate all the relevant documents of an event and sort them out and file them, and it will be done correctly. If the processed documents are handed over to the archives department in a pile and a bundle to be filed, and the archives workers have not handled the documents, it will be very difficult to maintain the inherent connection in the documents when filing. Some people say that if the document processing department files the documents, then the archives department has nothing to do? This is not right. The archives has its own specific nine tasks mentioned above. If the archives is required to receive scattered documents for filing, it will not only be difficult to do well, but it will also be impossible to complete its own tasks.

In order to improve document processing work and improve archives work in government agencies, there must be a unified basic regulation on the practice of document processing work and archives work. Now, the Party organizations above the provincial party committee have a relatively complete regulation on document processing and archives work, which has been approved by the Central Committee; the Central Committee also pointed out that other government agencies can also imitate it to improve and improve the document processing and archives work of their own government agencies, and start to formulate their own regulations or detailed rules. If we do this, and then formulate a reasonable destruction system (such as formulating a storage period table for archival materials), the work of archives in government agencies can lay the foundation.

However, it is not easy to implement the above principles. Because the old ideas and old habits of many comrades are not easy to change at once, and some government agencies still lack cadres and cadres lack professional knowledge. Changing old ideas and old habits requires a lot of propaganda, persuasion, and criticism work. For example, some comrades have become accustomed to keeping documents scattered, and feel that it is "inconvenient" to hand them over to the archives for centralized storage (if it is indeed "inconvenient", it is only because there are shortcomings in the archives work, and it should be started from improving the management of archives work). Some comrades do not agree that the document processing department should file documents, and some comrades still miss the old methods of sorting out archives, etc. In order to implement scientific archives work methods, we should introduce the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, so that archives workers can acquire professional knowledge and improve their professional and ideological level. In order to strengthen document and archives work, we also ask the responsible comrades of various government agencies and units, especially the responsible comrades of offices and secretarial departments, to equip document processing departments and archives departments with necessary cadres, and often care about them and improve them. The mobility of archives work cadres in some government agencies is high, and this should be prevented in the future.

In order to do these tasks well, the issue of training cadres is important. In addition to the fact that the archives training course of Renmin University of China is preparing to expand into a history archives department, which can train more and better cadres, we should strengthen and improve the existing on-the-job cadres. Training cadres cannot be specifically expected from Renmin University of China, because the number of students it can accommodate is limited. If we want to universally improve professional knowledge, the basic method is to conduct professional studies. All on-the-job archives workers should be at ease in their work, study hard, improve their skills, and hope that more outstanding cadres will take on this new job.

The Understanding and Efforts That Archives Workers Should Have
Direction

Since archives work is not a dispensable task, but a very important undertaking in the cause of the Party and the people, workers in this position must have correct views and practices on their work in order to complete the task, constantly improve themselves, and improve their business. I would like to offer a few suggestions here:

First of all, archives workers, like document processing workers, should have a correct understanding of their work and should attach importance to their work; no matter how you feel that others do not attach importance to this work, you should firmly attach importance to it and love it yourself. We must believe that archives work must be done well. The Party has assigned people like me to do archives work because the Party's cause needs me, so I should be determined to do this work well and do it for a lifetime. If other comrades do not understand the importance of this work, they can righteously explain it to them, and explain to them the role of archives work in today's government agency work, in scientific research work, how it uses yesterday's archives to serve today's work, and how it prepares to use today's archival materials to serve tomorrow's work, as well as other aspects of archives work. If you can't explain it clearly once, explain it again next time, until the other party agrees. Our Party has always attached importance to archives work, and today it is strengthening archives work, so what can we doubt?

Second, we must strive to learn Chinese and world history, learn the history of the Communist Party of China, learn Marxism-Leninism, and learn the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. It is impossible to do archives work without understanding history. Archives are history. We have encountered such old documents. Due to the shortcomings of document processing work in the past, there is no title, no issuing agency, and no year and month on the documents, making it difficult to judge its historical value. Without rich historical knowledge, it is impossible to sort it out, let alone study it. Sorting out and studying the Party's historical archives is only a little over thirty years at most, and it is easier to handle. It is more difficult to sort out and study China's pre-revolutionary historical archives. At the same time, if you only know some historical facts, but do not have the stand and method of Marxism-Leninism, and cannot use the ideological viewpoints of historical materialism, you will definitely not be able to do the sorting work well.

Some comrades have too low or not high enough education level and should first concentrate on learning culture. Only after improving their culture can they learn Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong.

Third, we must often study the Party's policies, the country's laws, decrees, and construction plans, etc. If archives workers do not do this, they will not be familiar with what the Party and state organs are currently doing, and they will not know how to use archival materials to serve today's work, take the initiative to help the work of their own government agency, and it is impossible to help the document processing department carry out filing work.

Fourth, we must learn the business. Archives work is a scientific work, not a simple technical work. To do this work well, we must not only have historical knowledge and the cultivation of Marxism-Leninism, but also study policies and laws, and have rich business knowledge. The history of archives and the theory of archives work in the Soviet Union should be learned, and the history of archives and archives knowledge in China should also be learned. Only by studying well can we take fewer detours in our work. Now, Renmin University of China has compiled four books on document processing and archives work, the Secretariat of the General Office of the CPC Central Committee and the State Archives Bureau are preparing to expand the distribution of the publication "Archives Work," and we have a provisional regulation on document processing and archives work, which have created very good conditions for us to conduct business studies, and we should make good use of these conditions.

The theory and experience of archives work in the Soviet Union are very valuable for us to improve our work, and have already saved us many detours. We must study hard. We should have a humble attitude and a pragmatic spirit when learning from the Soviet Union's experience, and oppose conservatism and mechanical application. The work and study in recent years have proved that the theory and method of archives work in the Soviet Union, like other scientific theories and methods, are the most advanced in the world; therefore, the conservative thinking of sticking to old rules is wrong. However, the theory and method of archives work in the Soviet Union are only a guide to action for the specific practices of each of our government agencies and each archives unit, not a dogma; therefore, it is also wrong to impatiently demand to change old rules without serious and systematic study, or to mechanically apply certain provisions without studying the specific situation.

Finally, we must always maintain a high degree of political vigilance and strictly guard state secrets. We should understand that our position is guarding the state's archival documents, and remember that the state's archival documents are what the enemy is trying to destroy and steal at all times. Therefore, we should keep our mouths shut about our identity, what our archives and archives preserve, and what work we do.

    略谈机关档案工作当前的几个问题
    曾三
    档案工作的范围和它在机关工作中的作用
    档案工作是一门相当复杂的专门工作，它的基本内容包括对档案材料的搜集、整理、鉴定、保管、统计和利用六个部分。如果把它看成只是“保管保管”文件，只“起一把锁的作用”，那是错误的。档案工作的根本目的在于使用或利用档案材料。如果把档案工作看作只是保管文件，而不去进行整理、鉴定、统计和搜集，便谈不到利用档案材料，这样的保管就没有意义，并且也就不可能把文件保管得好。
    档案工作包括机关档案室的工作和档案馆的工作。机关（包括一切国家机关、军队和军事机关、工厂、矿山、企业、农场、学校、团体、合作社等等）各单位在工作中所形成的一切文书，都应该立卷向机关档案室归档；各机关需要永久保存的档案，过了一定的年限，又应该向国家档案馆集中。在档案室和档案馆，要进行许多科学的整理和研究工作，以使档案材料为机关、为国家服务。这样有计划有步骤地把档案材料集中起来，整个的国家档案就反映着全国人民的生活和活动的各个方面，反映着人民的政治、经济状况和文化状况、生产斗争和阶级斗争状况，反映着科学、技术、文学和艺术的成就；因此，档案工作就不仅为机关工作所需要，而且也为人民和国家所需要，它不仅是机关工作的一部分，也成为我国科学工作的一部分了。
    随着国家建设的发展和各项工作的需要，目前机关档案室工作必须普遍地科学地建立起来。机关档案室应该做些什么和它在机关工作中起些什么作用呢？根据现在了解，机关档案室至少有以下几项具体工作：（一）帮助文书处理工作部门正确地进行立卷和归档；（二）接收、登记、整理、保管和统计机关各单位送来的档案材料；（三）编制档案材料的目录、索引、专题卡片等；（四）进行档案材料的鉴定工作，并对档案材料的存毁提出意见；
  （五）管理档案材料的阅览和出借；（六）根据机关工作的需要，从档案中提供有关材料；（七）根据机关领导人的指示，编印文件汇集；（八）按规定把长期保存的档案材料向指定的档案馆移交；
  （九）完成机关领导人交办的其它档案工作任务。
    档案室做好这些工作，第一，能够对机关的工作有直接的帮助。当机关各级工作人员在研究情况、解决问题或者总结工作时，他们可以随时调阅档案，或者要档案室供给一定的材料。档案室工作做得好的，还可以主动地随时为机关工作提供材料。第二，它可以把人民劳动的成果经过科学的整理鉴定，集中地保存下来，为机关、为国家积累历史材料，为各种科学研究工作进行准备。第三，档案室作好这些工作，建立起一套完整的制度，可以保障国家机密的安全；如果这套制度和文书处理部门配合得好，又可以防止文牍主义，克服官僚主义。
    但是，对于档案工作在机关工作中的这些作用，我们有些同志了解得还不是很全面的，甚至有不正确的看法。如有的同志以为把档案锁起来就是档案工作的全部。有的同志认为档案工作不能为今天的机关工作服务，用不着付出过多的力量进行整理、鉴定、统计等工作。前一种看法在战争时期和地下党时期还可以说是有一部分道理的，因为当时文书档案不多，也没有更好的工作条件。但是现在情况已经完全不同了。后一种看法也只有一部分道理。要求档案工作为今天的机关工作服务，这是对的；但它是以过去的档案来为今天的机关工作服务的，因而必须把过去的档案整理、保管好才能发挥它的作用。今天的文书也必须经过很好的立卷和归档，才能使明天的档案工作很好地为机关工作服务。如果今天的档案工作还不能很好地为机关工作服务，这只能得出一个结论，就是档案室工作还没有建立起来，应该立即着手去建立它。有的同志还没有注意到档案工作在国家生活中所起的上述的第二点作用。他们或者以为这一点不属于他们的任务范围，或者以为他们那一部门的工作记录对将来没有什么用处，用不着长期保存，这些想法都是不对的。全国各机关、军队、工厂、矿山、企业、农场、学校、团体、合作社……所形成的一切档案材料，都是全国人民的财富，其中有许多部分是必须由国家集中统一地永久保存的，任何单位都有责任把它安全地定期地送到档案馆去。如果以为只有中央机关或高级机关的档案有保存必要或者只从本单位着眼来看问题，自以为本单位的档案不是国家的财富，都是错误的。有的同志对于档案工作的第三点作用，还没有足够的认识。他们只满足于老一套的比较简单的保密制度和文书制度，不知道文书档案日积月累，有增无已，没有一套完整的长期的制度就会控制不了，不知道我们的机关工作日益繁忙，如果没有一套科学的文书处理和档案制度，要严密地保守国家机密并反对文牍主义和官僚主义，也是困难的。机关档案工作的目前情况
    我们党从来就是重视档案工作的，早在一九三一年，中央就规定了“文书处置办法”。这个办法的最后一句说，要把文书整理一份入库，备交将来革命胜利后的党史委员会。我们档案工作者看了这一句，极受感动，百倍地增加了对档案工作的热爱。但是，由于我们过去处在地下状态和战争环境，时常受到反动势力的迫害，我们党和革命政权所保存的档案材料毕竟还是不多的，也来不及创造一套文书处理和档案管理的科学方法。
    革命胜利后的五、六年来，随着工作的发展，机关的文书日渐增多，许多机关都已经开始建立了文书处理工作和档案工作。一九五○年，苏联先进的档案工作理论和经验传入我国以后，许多机关召开了档案工作会议，中共中央办公厅秘书处还创刊了“档案工作”杂志。中国人民大学于一九五二年创办了档案专修班（一九五三年改为专修科），成立了档案教研室，在苏联专家亲切的帮助下，培养了干部，编译了业务书籍，组织在职干部进行了业务学习，并已着手进行有关中国档案史材料的收集。无疑的，这些工作对于提高文书处理和档案工作人员的思想水平和业务水平，对于改进机关档案工作，是起了作用的，并且为它在今后的发展打下了基础。
    但是，整个说来，我们过去几年的工作还远远落后于实际工作的需要。过去几年我们还是处在交换经验、学习苏联、培养干部、局部改进的阶段，少数机关对文书处理和档案工作虽然有了一些改进，但是就全国来说还没有一个统一的、科学的和系统的做法，并且还有不少机关的文书处理工作存在着很大的缺点。有些机关的文书登记和保管制度还不健全，许多文件下落不明；许多事情的来文和去文分家，使得立卷工作无法正确进行；处理完毕的文书，还分散保存在承办单位或承办人手中，没有立卷和归档。许多机关的档案室所收到的大部分档案材料，是从收发部门“归档”的，而不是由文书处理部门归档的；文书处理部门不进行立卷便把零散的档案材料一包一捆地去归档的现象，更是非常普遍。
    除文书处理工作还不健全、归档制度还没有正确地建立以外，机关档案室的工作还普遍存在以下的缺点：（一）保管的档案不完整；（二）整理的方法不科学；（三）鉴定无标准，甚至随便销毁档案材料；（四）档案机构不健全，甚至有的机关还根本没有档案室，只是派一二个同志把档案锁起来。
    许多机关由于各单位分散处理和保管文件，它的档案室就只保存了机关办公厅（室）的一部分文件，而且又是送来就收下，不送来也不要，实际只进行了本机关一部分文件的立卷和保管工作，没有起到机关档案室应有的作用。这样不但档案的安全无法保证，而且在使用档案的时候也是非常不便的。
    整理档案的方法，各机关也还是不一致的，并且还有不少是沿用十进的图书分类法或按“门、类、纲、目”保存，没有系统地装订成卷，有的只按收发文编号保存，有的根本没有目录。文书用纸和排写格式不一致，来去文电分家，又增加了整理工作的困难。在档案文件的销毁方面，没有明确的标准，有的同志把自己认为无保存价值的都销毁，这样就造成了许多损失。例如有一个市委宣传部管理文件的同志认为底稿无用，就把一年半时间所积存的文件底稿全部销毁。还有一个市人民政府把接收来的旧档案烧去百分之九十。许多机关销毁档案以后，没有留下目录，所以究竟销毁了什么，也无法知道。近几年来，一般的都已经停止了随便销毁文件的做法，但是对于日益增多的文书档案应如何分别处理，还没有办法。
    最后，许多机关档案室的组织很不健全，档案工作人员的质和量都不足。有的档案工作人员，文化程度太低，健康状况不好，只能做一些看管工作。某些档案工作人员对这一工作的认识还不全面，不安心工作。有的机关不肯派适当的干部加强这一工作，或者由于其他工作需要人，又把熟练的档案工作人员调走，以致干部调动太多，难以积累经验。
  当前机关档案工作的中心任务
    我国档案工作目前急待解决的问题，是如何建立和改进机关档案室的工作。
    为了健全机关档案室的工作，必须改进机关文书处理工作。机关的文书处理工作和档案工作，都属于秘书工作范围，当机关的工作范围较小的时候，可以由一个工作部门甚至一个工作人员担负，但是现在各机关的工作范围都很大，这两项工作就必须分工而又密切地合作，才能对机关工作发挥更好的作用。健全的文书处理工作不仅对机关的领导工作有帮助，而且是作好机关档案工作的先行条件。例如文书的纸张格式不统一，来文去文无联系，文书处理单位不立卷等等，都直接影响到档案工作的建立和健全。档案工作者是关心文书处理工作的，并且有责任帮助文书处理部门进行立卷工作。当然，档案室没有建立好，反过来也是要影响到文书处理工作的，如档案保管方法不科学，当机关领导人或文书处理部门需要档案材料时供给不上，就要给工作增加许多困难，所以文书处理部门也应该关心机关档案室的工作。
    有人说，文书处理部门是办理文书的，不能做立卷工作。这是因为他们不知道立卷工作必须成为文书处理工作的一部分。当文书处理部门办完文书以后，把一件事情的一切有关文书集中起来加以整理立卷，是不费大功夫的，也会做得正确。如果把办理过的文书一堆一捆地移交给档案部门立卷，而档案工作人员又不曾经手办理文书，所以在立卷的时候要保持文书中的固有联系就会发生很大的困难。有人说，文书处理部门立了卷，档案部门不是没有事干了吗？这是不对的。档案室有它自己特定的上述九项任务。如果要档案室接收分散的文书来立卷，就不但不容易作好，也无法完成自己的任务。
    为了改进文书处理工作和健全机关档案室工作，必须对文书处理工作和档案室工作的做法有一个统一的基本的规定。现在，省委以上的党的组织的文书处理和档案工作已经有了一个比较完善的条例，并经中央批准；中央并指出，其它机关也可以仿照它来改进和健全本机关的文书处理和档案工作，并着手制定自己的条例或细则。照这样做下去，再制定一个合理的销毁制度（如制定一个档案材料保管期限表），机关档案室的工作就可以打下基础了。
    但是，要贯彻上述原则，是不很容易的。因为许多同志的旧观念旧习惯不容易一下改过来，有的机关也还缺乏干部和干部缺乏业务知识。改变旧观念和旧习惯，要做许多宣传说服和批判工作。如有的同志对文件分散保管已成习惯，觉得交由档案室集中起来反而使用“不便”（如确实“不便”，只是因为档案工作有缺点，应从改进档案工作的管理入手）。有的同志不赞成由文书处理部门立卷，有的同志还留恋旧的整理档案的方法等。为了实行科学的档案工作方法，应该介绍苏联的先进经验，使档案工作人员取得业务知识，提高业务水平和思想水平。为了加强文书、档案工作，我们也要求各机关各单位的负责同志，特别是办公、秘书部门的负责同志，为文书处理部门和档案部门配备必要的干部，并经常关心他们，提高他们。有些机关的档案工作干部，流动性大，今后也应该防止。
    为了做好这些工作，培养干部问题是重要的。除中国人民大学档案专修科准备扩大成为历史档案系、可以培养更多更好的干部外，应加强和提高现有的在职干部。培养干部，是不能专门指望中国人民大学的，因为它能收容的学生是有限的，我们要普遍地提高业务知识，基本的办法就是进行业务学习。所有在职的档案工作人员应该安心工作，努力学习，提高业务，并希望有更多的优秀干部走上这一新的工作岗位。
    档案工作者应有的认识和努力
  方向
    档案工作既然不是什么可有可无的工作，而是党和人民的事业中一项很重要的事业，在这一个岗位上的工作人员，就必须对自己的工作有正确的看法和做法，才能完成任务，不断地提高自己和提高业务。我在这里想贡献几点意见：
    首先，档案工作人员，和文书处理工作人员一样，都应该对自己的工作有正确的认识，应该重视自己的工作；不管你怎样感觉别人不重视这一工作，你自己应该坚定地重视它、热爱它。我们要相信，档案工作必须做好，党把我这样的人分配来做档案工作，就是因为党的事业需要我，因此我就应该下决心做好这一工作，并且做一辈子。如果其他同志不了解这一工作的重要性，就可以理直气壮地向他解释，把档案工作对今天的机关工作起什么作用，对科学研究工作起什么作用，它怎样用昨天的档案为今天的工作服务，又怎样准备用今天的档案材料为明天的工作服务，以及档案工作的其他方面，都向他讲清楚。一次讲不透，下次再讲，直到对方同意为止。我们的党从来是重视档案工作的，今天又正在加强档案工作，我们自己还有什么可以怀疑的呢？
    第二，要努力学习中国的和世界的历史，学习中国共产党的历史，学习马克思列宁主义，学习毛泽东同志的著作。作档案工作不懂历史是不行的。档案就是历史。我们曾经遇到过这样的老文件，由于过去文书处理工作的缺点，在文件上既无题目，又无出文机关和年月，使人很难判断它的历史价值。如果没有丰富的历史知识，就无法进行整理，更不用谈研究了。整理和研究党的历史档案，最多也不过三十多年，还好办一些，要整理和研究我国革命前的历史档案，就更难了。同时，如果只知道一些历史事实，而没有马克思列宁主义的立场和方法，不能运用历史唯物主义的思想观点，也决然做不好整理工作。
    有的同志文化程度太低或者不高，应该先集中力量学习文化。只有提高了文化以后，才有可能学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东同志的著作。
    第三，要经常研究党的政策、国家的法律、法令和建设计划等等。档案工作人员如果不这样，就不能熟悉党和国家机关目前要做什么，就不知道怎样运用档案材料来为今天的工作服务，主动地帮助本机关的工作，也不可能帮助文书处理部门进行立卷工作。
    第四，要学习业务。档案工作是一门科学的工作，不是简单的技术工作，要做好这一工作，不但要具有历史知识和马克思列宁主义的修养，不但要研究政策和法令，而且要有丰富的业务知识。苏联的档案历史和档案工作理论应当学习，中国的档案历史和档案知识也要学习。只有很好地进行学习，才能在工作中少走弯路。现在，中国人民大学已编译了四本关于文书处理和档案工作的书籍，中共中央办公厅秘书局和国家档案局准备扩大地发行“档案工作”这一刊物，我们又有了一个关于文书处理和档案工作的暂行条例，它们都为我们进行业务学习造成了很好的条件，我们应该很好地利用这些条件。
    苏联的档案工作理论和经验，对于我们改进工作是很宝贵的，已经使我们少走许多弯路。我们还要好好学习。我们学习苏联经验，应当具有虚心的态度和实事求是的精神，反对保守思想和机械搬用。几年来的工作和学习证明，苏联的档案工作理论和方法，也像其他科学理论和方法一样，是世界上最先进的；因此，墨守成规的保守思想是不对的。但是苏联档案工作的理论和方法，对我们每一个机关、每一个档案单位的具体做法只是行动的指南，不是教条；因此，如果不通过认真地和系统地学习就急躁地要求改变旧规，或者不研究具体的情况就机械地搬用某些条条，也是不对的。
    最后，我们要时刻保持高度的政治警惕性，严守国家的机密。我们应该了解自己的岗位是守卫着国家的档案文件，牢记着国家档案文件是敌人每时每刻都企图破坏和盗窃的，因此我们对自己的身份，我们档案室和档案馆保存什么和做些什么工作等，应该守口如瓶。
