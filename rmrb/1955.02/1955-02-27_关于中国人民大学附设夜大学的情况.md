Regarding the Situation of the Affiliated Night University of Renmin University of China

Since this newspaper published the news on the third page on February 4th about the Affiliated Marxist-Leninist Night University of Renmin University of China opening new classes, comrades from various organs, organizations, troops, and schools in the capital, as well as those from other places who are willing to study, have written to inquire about the situation of the Night University and request to participate in the studies. A brief introduction is now provided as follows:

The purpose of the Chinese Communist Party Committee of Renmin University of China in establishing the Night University is to systematically teach the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism to the university's teachers and cadres during their spare time. This is to improve the political theory and policy thinking of teachers and cadres, thereby improving the quality of teaching and work efficiency to meet the needs of national socialist construction.

The course content consists entirely of political theory courses. According to the Party Committee's plan for the political theory education of on-the-job cadres, the course content of the Night University is divided into four courses: "History of the Chinese Revolution," "Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism," "Political Economy," and "Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism." The study period for each course is one year. Each year, all four courses are offered simultaneously, and each person chooses one course per year. Those who complete all four courses and pass the examination will be issued a graduation certificate.

Teaching methods: primarily systematic lectures, supplemented by self-study and classroom discussions. Students must carefully attend lectures, take notes, read the required reference books, and participate in classroom discussions and learning examinations according to the time specified in the teaching plan.

The target of enrollment is mainly the university's teachers and cadres, and, conditions permitting such as classroom space and teaching resources, appropriate consideration will be given to the political theory studies of cadres from outside organizations. Any on-the-job cadre who is in good health, has a cultural level equivalent to that of a high school graduate, and has a certain foundation in political theory can be admitted with the recommendation of the Party committee of their affiliated organization. However, it must be guaranteed that the students have sufficient time for study (class attendance, self-study, classroom discussions, and intensive review time one week before the exam) so that they can concentrate on studying the courses of the Night University. Enrollment time is generally from late January to mid-February, and from late July to mid-August. Enrollment will cease after the start of classes, and no auditors will be accepted. Currently, the quota for the History of the Chinese Revolution class is full, and due to limited resources, there are no plans to increase the number of classes.

    关于中国人民大学附设夜大学的情况
    自本报在二月四日第三版刊登了中国人民大学附设马克思列宁主义夜大学增开新班的消息以后，首都各机关、团体、部队、学校以及各地志愿学习的同志们纷纷来信，询问夜大学的情况，并要求参加学习。现将简单情况介绍如下：
    中国共产党中国人民大学委员会成立夜大学的目的是利用业余时间对本校教师和干部系统讲授马克思列宁主义基本理论，提高教师和干部的政治理论和政策思想水平，从而提高教学质量和工作效能，以适应国家社会主义建设的需要。
    课程内容全系政治理论课。根据校党委关于在职干部政治理论教育计划规定夜大学的课程内容分为：“中国革命史”、“马列主义基础”、“政治经济学”、“辩证唯物论与历史唯物论”四门课程。各课学习期限均为一年，每年同时开出四门课程，每人每年任选一课，学完四门课程并经考试及格者发给毕业证书。
    教学方法：以系统讲授为主，自修和课室讨论为辅。学员必须按照教学计划中所规定的时间，认真听课作笔记，阅读必读的参考书，按时参加课堂讨论和学习考试。
    招收学员的对象，主要是本校的教师和干部，并在教室和教师力量允许的条件下适当照顾校外机关干部的政治理论学习。凡身体健康并具有相当于高中的文化程度和一定政治理论基础的在职干部，经所属机关党委保送，都可入学。但必须保证学员的学习时间（上课、自学、课堂讨论和考试前一周的集中复习时间），以便集中精力学好夜大学的课程。招生时间一般在一月下旬至二月中旬，七月下旬至八月中旬，开课后不再招生，也不收旁听生。目前，中国革命史班的名额已满，因限于力量，不拟增加班次。
