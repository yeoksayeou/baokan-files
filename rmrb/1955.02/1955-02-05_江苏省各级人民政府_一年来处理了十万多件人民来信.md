    Jiangsu Province's People's Governments at All Levels
    Have Handled Over 100,000 Pieces of People's Letters in the Past Year
    Jiangsu Province's People's Governments at all levels have handled over 100,000 pieces of people's letters in the past year.
    The Industry Department and the Agriculture and Forestry Department of the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government have earnestly handled over 380 letters containing constructive suggestions regarding industrial and agricultural production. Peng Qingyu, a laboratory technician at the Qingjiang City Local State-Owned Guanghua Chemical Factory, proposed the idea of refining oil from castor seeds, and Zhang Dingxian, a worker from Suzhou, proposed the idea of refining oil from silkworm pupae; both have been adopted. Dong Lijian, a student at Funing Middle School, designed a rice-planting machine, which has attracted the attention of the Industry Department and agricultural scientific research departments, and is now being prepared for research and trial production. Through handling people's letters, the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government Grain Bureau has adopted rationalization proposals made by the masses, such as the "boiling water scalding method" for preventing and controlling bean weevil pests and the "square enclosure method" for saving warehouse space.
    People's governments at all levels have used the criticisms raised in people's letters as a basis for improving their work. Based on the opinions raised in the people's letters, the Nanjing Municipal Health Department corrected the shortcomings of long registration, waiting, and medication times and short consultation times in hospital outpatient work. The Songjiang County People's Bank accepted the criticisms raised in people's letters and corrected the inappropriate bias in loans to private industry and commerce. The Songjiang Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Transportation Administration, based on the opinions raised in the people's letters, strengthened the management and education of private shipping and motor transport companies.

    江苏省各级人民政府
    一年来处理了十万多件人民来信
    江苏省各级人民政府一年来处理了十万多件人民来信。
    江苏省人民政府工业厅和农林厅认真处理了三百八十多件对工业、农业生产方面提出的建设性意见的来信。清江市地方国营光华化学厂化验员彭清豫提出用蓖麻种子炼油的建议，苏州市工人张鼎贤提出用蚕蛹炼油的建议都已被采用。阜宁中学学生董立鉴设计了一种插秧用的机器，引起工业厅和农业科学研究部门的重视，现正准备研究试制。江苏省人民政府粮食厅通过处理人民来信，采用了群众提出的关于防治杂豆虫害的“沸水烫杀法”和节省仓容的“方型围囤法”等合理化建议。
    各级人民政府对人民来信中提出的批评都作为改进工作的依据。南京市卫生部门根据人民来信提出的意见，改正医院门诊工作中挂号、候诊、取药时间长，看病时间短的缺点。松江县人民银行接受人民来信中提出的批评，纠正了对私营工商业贷款不当的偏向。松江专署交通运输管理局根据人民来信提出的意见，加强了对私营轮船业和汽车行的管理教育工作。　（新华社）
