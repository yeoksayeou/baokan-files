Don't Sign and Stamp Indiscriminately
　　Kong Sang
    In our economic organizations and enterprises, some responsible comrades irresponsibly sign and stamp official documents or receipts, resulting in some cases of embezzlement and lawbreaking.

    Zhuo Huatong (a cashier at a construction site in Beijing), an embezzler recently sentenced to fifteen years in prison by the Supreme People's Court, used one of his embezzlement methods by presenting thick stacks of receipts and invoices to the chief accountant for stamping. The chief accountant didn't even look at the documents; he simply took out his personal seal from the drawer and said, "Old Zhuo, take it and stamp them yourself; I don't need to look." Zhuo Huatong similarly took thick stacks of documents to the construction site director for stamping. The director listlessly took out his seal and stamped all the documents like a machine, without knowing anything about their content. Zhuo Huatong took the documents back, opened the cash register, and filled his own pockets with stacks of banknotes. He embezzled a total of 52 million yuan of public funds.

    It is said that in one department, some people were ordered to do something in one way, while others were ordered to do the same thing in another way. As a result, the two groups clashed, argued endlessly, and couldn't reach a consensus. But they were all acting on orders stamped with the same seal of the same leader. It turned out that although the seal was the same, the people requesting the stamping were not the same, but all had been stamped.

    A "joke" circulated at one construction site: the site director was a fat man, and he always signed and stamped material requisition forms without asking what materials were being requisitioned or how much, which caused great losses of materials. Two workers saw that the waste of materials was too outrageous, but no one paid attention to their suggestions. They wrote a requisition form: "Now requisitioning one fat man, two arms, two thighs..." This form was sent to the fat director, who, as usual, signed "Approve" and stamped his own seal. This form eventually reached the materials warehouse, and the warehouse manager couldn't "approve" it, which exposed the matter and turned it into a "joke."

    Such stories of blindly stamping may be found again, but the above is enough to be alarming. We hope that responsible comrades at all levels in our economic organizations and enterprises must truly take responsibility, and not betray the trust of the state and the people. Don't sign and stamp indiscriminately, lest you be taken advantage of by counter-revolutionaries or bad elements, and lest you further expand loopholes that can be plugged. In short, do not let your bureaucratic style cause losses to the country and the people.

    不要糊里糊涂地签字盖章
    孔桑
    在我们的经济机关和企业里，有些负责同志很不负责地在公文或单据上签字盖章，结果发生了一些贪污犯法事情。
    最近被最高人民法院判处十五年徒刑的贪污犯卓华通（北京市一个建筑工地的出纳员），他的贪污手法之一，就是捧着厚厚的一叠叠的单据和发货票，去请主管会计盖章，而主管会计根本不看单据，就从抽屉里摸出自己的私章说：“老卓，你拿去盖吧，我不用看了。”卓华通又同样地拿着厚厚的一叠叠的单据去找工地主任盖章，工地主任没精打采地掏出图章，像机器一样捺完了全部单据，至于这些单据是什么内容，他却一点也不知道。卓华通拿回了单据，开开钱柜，就把一叠叠的钞票装满了他自己的口袋。他先后贪污的公款是五千二百多万元。
    据说：在一个部门里，一部分人奉命对一件事要这样作，而另一部分人却奉命对同一件事要那样作。结果，两部分人碰在一起，争吵不休，莫衷一是。但他们却都是拿着盖有同一首长的同样图章的命令行事的。原来，图章虽是一个，但要求盖章的人却不是一个，但都盖上了。
    有一个工地还流传着一个“笑话”：工地主任是个胖子，他向来是不问领什么材料、也不管领多少，就在领料单据上签字盖章的，这使材料遭受到很大损失。有两个工人看见材料浪费得太不像话，提意见也没人理，他俩就写了一张单据：“兹领到胖子一个，胳膊一双，大腿两条……”这个单据送到胖子主任手上，主任照例签了“照发”，并且盖上他自己的图章，这张单据一直到了材料仓库，仓库管理人员无法“照发”，才把事情揭穿而传为“笑话”。
    这种糊里糊涂乱盖图章的故事也许还能再找到一些，但上面的已足够令人警惕了。希望我们经济机关和企业里各级负责同志们，一定要真正把责任负起来，切莫辜负国家和人民的委托，不问青黄皂白就签字盖章，以免被反革命或坏分子钻空子，也免得使可以堵住的漏洞更加扩大。总之，是不要使你的官僚主义作风给国家和人民造成损失。
