    Self-Criticism Regarding the Inferior Quality of Our Factory's Products
    —A Self-Criticism in Response to Criticism from the People's Daily
    Mao Qijiu, Deputy Director of Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant

    The two articles published in the People's Daily on January 18th, page two, "Accept the Lesson of the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant" and "The Product Quality of the Shenyang No. 2 Machine Tool Plant is Too Poor," are correct in their criticism of the inferior quality of our factory's products. The reason for the poor quality of our products is mainly due to the serious bourgeois ideology that exists within me personally.

    In my work, I only emphasize quantity and not quality, and I lack the idea of comprehensively completing tasks. When assigning tasks and issuing plans, I rarely emphasize quality, but simply pursue a large variety and quantity of products. Our four new products trial-produced in 1954 used the technical preparation work of unqualified old products as the standard for the technical preparation work of the new products. We even put them into mass production before they were successfully trial-produced. After they were put into production, we didn't follow the process documents. Some of the process documents were simply impractical and impossible to implement, which resulted in the failure of these four new products to be successfully trial-produced. Parts produced in the machining and foundry workshops were sometimes scrapped because they did not meet the requirements of the drawings. However, in order to complete the quantity target, we even picked out the scrapped parts from the warehouse and installed them on the machine tools. Many users have raised opinions on the quality of our factory's products, such as oil leakage, iron filings, and gear noise, but we have never actively taken effective measures to improve product quality.

    We also have bureaucratic work styles and an irresponsible attitude towards work. We ignore long-standing problems within the factory. For example, our technical management is very chaotic. The design department changes drawings at will without anyone's approval. Various systems within the factory are also unsound, and the systems that have been established exist only in name. Under the influence of this leadership ideology, the workers' attitude of neglecting quality has also grown. When problems are discovered, they pass the buck and are irresponsible.

    The above errors are inseparable from my serious complacency. I am satisfied with the past achievements and cannot see the shortcomings that exist today. For example, I think that we already have a set of experience in producing old products, and it is easy to trial-produce new products. This has caused a large number of products to be scrapped, which not only wastes a lot of state funds but also affects the construction of key projects and the process of socialist industrialization.

    I will definitely learn from the lessons of this quality inspection. In future work: First, I will overcome complacency, correct my ideological understanding, establish the viewpoint of comprehensively completing the state plan and quantity subordinate to quality, and conscientiously study the instructions of higher authorities and various technical documents, and implement them in a led and organized manner. Second, to ensure product quality, according to the instructions of the Second Bureau of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry, re-trial-produce four new products, and review the drawings, revise and supplement process documents, check the precision of existing measuring and checking fixtures, and supplement them according to the requirements of the parts. The inventory of parts must also be checked, and all the old products in the inventory must be reworked to ensure that products that meet national standards are produced to meet the needs of national industrial construction, so as to make up for the losses caused to the country in the past.

### 关于我厂产品质量低劣的检讨——对人民日报批评的检讨

    关于我厂产品质量低劣的检讨
    ——对人民日报批评的检讨
    沈阳第二机床厂副厂长　毛耆久
    一月十八日人民日报二版所载“接受沈阳第二机床厂的教训”和“沈阳第二机床厂的产品质量太坏了”两文，对我厂产品质量低劣的批评是正确的。我厂质量所以低劣，主要是由于我个人存在着严重的资产阶级思想。
    在工作中，我只重量不重质，缺乏全面完成任务的思想。在布置工作和下达计划时，很少强调质量，单纯追求生产品种多、数量多。我们一九五四年试制的四种新产品，便是以不合格的老产品的技术准备工作为标准，进行了新产品的技术准备工作，甚至还没有试制成功就大量投入生产，投入生产后也不按工艺文件办事，有的工艺文件根本不切合实际，也无法贯彻，致使这四种新产品不能试制成功。在加工车间和铸工车间生产出来的部件，有的不合图纸要求报废了，但为了完成数量任务，我们竟又把已经报废的零件从仓库里拣出来装到机床上。有许多用户对我厂产品质量提出意见，如漏油、铁碴、齿轮噪音等，我们始终没有积极采取有效措施来改进产品质量。
    我们在工作中还存在着官僚主义作风和不负责任的工作态度，对厂内长期存在的问题置之不理。例如我们的技术管理非常混乱，设计科不经过任何人的批准就乱改图纸，厂内的各种制度也不健全，已经制订的制度流于形式。在这种领导思想影响下，也滋长了职工忽视质量的情绪，发现问题互相推诿，不负责任。
    上述错误与我严重的骄傲自满情绪也分不开，我满足于过去的点滴成就，看不到今天存在的缺点，例如我认为生产老产品已经有一套经验了，试制新产品很容易，这样便造成了大量产品报废的错误，不仅浪费了国家的大量资金，也影响了重点工程的建设和社会主义工业化的进程。
    我一定吸取这次质量检查的教训，在今后工作中：第一，克服骄傲自满情绪，端正思想认识，树立全面完成国家计划和数量服从质量的观点，认真学习上级指示和各种技术文件，有领导有组织地贯彻执行。第二，保证产品质量，根据第一机械工业部第二机器管理局的指示，重新试制四种新产品，并审查图纸、修改及增补工艺文件，检查已有的量检夹具的精密程度，及按部件的要求加以补充。对于库存的部件也须作一次检查，并全部返修库存的旧产品，保证生产出合乎国家标准的产品，供应国家工业建设的需要，以弥补过去给国家所造成的损失。
