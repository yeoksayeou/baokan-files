    Who is Frightened by the Atomic War Racket?
    Cui Qi
    In order to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan, Penghu, and the coastal islands, the American aggressor group has exhausted all means of intimidation and blackmail. Just as the United States directly participates in the military actions of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and attempts to occupy China's coastal islands, the American warmongers are also cooperating to issue arrogant calls for atomic war against the Chinese people.
    On February 6, Anderson, chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy of the US Congress, clamored in a radio program that in the event of any "small" war, the United States has enough "various styles and kinds" of nuclear weapons that can be used immediately, and the United States has a "very large number of nuclear weapons," etc. On the same day, Martin, the Republican leader of the US House of Representatives, also clamored in another radio program that "if a full-scale conflict occurs with Communist China, the United States is prepared to use all the weapons in its arsenal, including atomic bombs, and can make that country kneel within thirty days."
    This is not the first time that American warmongers have brandished atomic weapons at the Chinese people, and it has never frightened the Chinese people. But Martin is so arrogant as to think that the use of atomic weapons can make the Chinese people "kneel" within thirty days, which shows that his war mania has reached the point of being feverish.
    To whom have the Chinese people ever knelt? Countless examples in Chinese history can be left aside. Just taking the American aggression against China as an example, more than five years ago, the United States used six billion US dollars in capital and used the eight million troops of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique in an attempt to make the Chinese people kneel. At that time, they brought "various styles and kinds" of airplanes and cannons to deal with our rifles and hand grenades. But now, where have those American imperialist elements who were rampant on the Chinese mainland only five years ago gone? Apart from willingly clamoring in front of the loudspeakers of American broadcasting companies, what other means do they have?
    In the Korean War, the United States also used germ warfare and calls for the use of atomic bombs in an attempt to force the Korean and Chinese people to kneel, attempting to gain in the armistice negotiations what it could not gain in the war. However, in the summer of 1953, the Korean and Chinese People's Forces dealt a heavy blow to the American aggressors in the counterattack south of Jin Cheng, and then the American aggressor group hurriedly signed the armistice agreement.
    Isn't it clear that it is not the Chinese people who have soft knees?
    Atomic weapons cannot scare the Chinese people. Neither atomic weapons nor cunning diplomatic tricks can shake the Chinese people's determination to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, and the coastal islands.
    In today's world, when the United States has long lost its monopoly on atomic weapons, it is really strange that Anderson and Martin and other American war peddlers still cling to atomic weapons as their only hope. This can only show that the American aggressor group's hatred of mankind and peace-loving people has reached such a degree that they have lost the basic common sense and rationality of mankind, and their nerves have become somewhat abnormal. This kind of clamor will of course only make the people of the world see the true face of the American aggressor group more clearly, and make some of the deceptive words of peace that they have recently liked to use completely lose their effect.
    Nearly six years ago, the American warmonger Forrestal became mentally disturbed and committed suicide by jumping off a building because of his calls for war. It seems that the door to Forrestal's path has also been opened for those who are now clamoring for the use of atomic weapons. An Associated Press reporter reported on January 28 that someone in the United States called the government authorities and said that someone had buried atomic bombs in several cities in the eastern United States. American officials believe that the caller is a neurotic. This fact clearly shows that it is not others who are frightened by the American aggressor group's atomic weapons racket, but the United States itself. Who can predict that today's American atomic war criers will not be frightened by the atomic weapons in their hands and embark on the road of Forrestal?

    原子战争的叫嚣吓倒了谁？
    崔奇
    为了阻挠中国人民解放台湾、澎湖和沿海岛屿，美国侵略集团已经把一切恫吓、讹诈的手段都用尽了。就在美国直接参与蒋介石卖国集团的军事行动，并企图侵占中国沿海岛屿的时候，美国的好战分子们又配合着对中国人民发出了原子战争的狂妄叫嚣。
    二月六日，美国国会两院原子能联合委员会主席安德逊在一个广播节目中叫嚷说，万一发生任何
  “小型”战争，在必要时美国有足够的“各种式样和种类”的核子武器可以立即使用，美国有“数目非常雄厚的核子武器”，等等。同一天，美国众议院共和党领袖马丁也在另一个广播节目中叫嚷说，“万一同共产党中国发生全面冲突，美国已准备用它的武器库中的一切武器，包括原子弹在内，而且能够使那个国家在三十天内屈膝。”
    美国好战分子们对中国人民挥舞原子武器，这已经不是第一次，也从来没有吓倒过中国人民。但是马丁竟然狂妄到认为使用原子武器就可以使中国人民在三十天之内“屈膝”，这说明他的战争狂已经到了热昏的程度。
    中国人民向谁屈过膝？中国历史上的无数事例可以不谈，仅仅拿美国对中国的侵略来说，五年多以前，美国曾经用了六十亿美元的资本，使用了蒋介石卖国集团的八百万军队，企图使中国人民屈膝。那时候，他们把“各种式样和种类的”飞机大炮拿来对付我们的步枪和手榴弹。可是，现在，那些仅仅五年前还在中国大陆上横冲直撞的美国帝国主义分子们到哪里去了？他们除了在美国的广播公司的扩音机前一向情愿地叫嚷以外，还有什么办法？
    在朝鲜战争中，美国也曾经用细菌战争和使用原子弹的叫嚣来企图迫使朝中人民屈膝，企图在停战谈判中获得它在战争中得不到的东西。但是，在一九五三年夏季，朝中人民部队在金城以南的反击战中给了美国侵略者沉重的打击，跟着，美国侵略集团就赶紧签订了停战协定。
    膝盖软的绝不是中国人民，这不是很清楚的事情吗？
    原子武器是吓不倒中国人民的。无论是原子武器，无论是狡猾的外交手腕，都决不可能动摇中国人民解放台湾、澎湖和沿海岛屿的决心。
    在美国早已丧失了原子武器垄断权的今天，安德逊和马丁一流的美国战争贩子们还要死死的抱着原子武器做他们的唯一希望，这真是非常奇怪的事。这只能表示美国侵略集团仇视人类、仇视爱好和平的人民已经到了这样的程度，致使他们丧失了人类起码的常识和理性，使他们的神经有些变态。这种叫嚣当然只会使全世界人民更清楚地看到美国侵略集团的真面目，使他们近来喜欢使用的一些骗人的和平字眼完全失去作用。
    将近六年以前，美国的好战分子福莱斯特尔因为叫嚣战争而神经失常，跳楼自杀了。对于现在那些叫嚣使用原子武器的人，走向福莱斯特尔的道路的大门看样子也已经打开了。美联社记者在一月二十八日报道说，在美国有人打电话给政府当局说，在美国东部的几个城市中有人埋放了原子弹。美国官方认为这个打电话的人是个神经病者。这个事实清楚地说明了，被美国侵略集团的原子武器叫嚣吓坏的并不是别人，而是美国自己。有谁能预料，今天美国的那些原子战争叫嚣者不会被他们自己手里的原子武器所吓倒，而走上福莱斯特尔的道路呢？
