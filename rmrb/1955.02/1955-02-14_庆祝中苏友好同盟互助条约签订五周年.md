    Celebrating the Fifth Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance
    Li Jishen, Chairman of the Central Standing Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang
    The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has been signed for five years.
    Over the past five years, the unbreakable alliance and fraternal friendship between the great peoples of China and the Soviet Union have been continuously consolidated and developed. We, the Chinese people, deeply realize that the great selfless assistance of the Soviet government and people to our country and the rock-solid unity of the two peoples are an important guarantee for our continuous progress from victory to victory over the past five years.
    The Soviet Union's great, comprehensive, and selfless assistance to China has shown the world a new type of international relations; the complete alignment of the foreign policies of the Soviet Union and China and the sincere cooperation between the two countries in international affairs play a decisive role in safeguarding peace in Asia and the world and promoting friendly relations between the peoples of all countries.
    Last year, during the fifth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet government delegation visited China. The two countries held talks on various issues concerning Sino-Soviet relations and the international situation, and subsequently issued a joint declaration on Sino-Soviet relations and various issues of the international situation, as well as other important declarations and communiqués. These documents mark the further consolidation and development of the great friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, and demonstrate the determination of the two countries to jointly safeguard peace and security in Asia and the world. Here, we cannot help but recall that thirty years ago, the great pioneer of the Chinese revolution, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, in his letter to the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, expressed the hope that "the two countries will join hands and advance together in the great battle for the freedom of the oppressed nations of the world to achieve victory." Mr. Sun Yat-sen's ideal has been fully realized today. This makes us, the Chinese people, firmly believe that as we advance along the glorious path taken by the Soviet Union, we will always receive the friendly cooperation and assistance of the Soviet government and people, and the Soviet people will always be our most reliable and loyal friends. Loving the Soviet Union and learning from the Soviet Union have become a lasting and high-spirited upsurge in our country's social life. The desire of our entire nation to continue to develop and consolidate the friendship and fraternal cooperation between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union has been solemnly written into the Constitution of the People's Republic of China.
    Now, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the government, our entire nation is fighting to liberate Taiwan, eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, smash American imperialist aggression, and defend peace in Asia. The Soviet government and people have consistently given us righteous support. Recently, the Soviet Union proposed a resolution in the United Nations Security Council to condemn the United States for its aggression in the Taiwan region, and the solemn positions declared by Chairman Bulganin and Foreign Minister Molotov in their speeches at the Supreme Soviet meeting have given us great encouragement and strengthened our confidence in victory.
    Today, as we celebrate the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, we are filled with gratitude to the Soviet government and people. We must further strive to strengthen the friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union and consolidate the great alliance of the two major powers. We must learn from the Soviet Union even better. Our struggle to liberate Taiwan will surely be victorious, and our great cause of building socialism will surely succeed!

    庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订五周年
    中国国民党革命委员会中央常务委员会主席  李济深
    中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订已经五周年了。
    五年来中苏两国伟大人民的牢不可破的同盟和兄弟般的友谊，正在日益巩固和发展着。我们中国人民深刻体会到：苏联政府和人民对我国伟大无私的援助和两国人民坚如磐石的团结，是我们五年来不断地从胜利走向胜利的一个重要的保证。
    苏联对中国的伟大的、全面的、无私的援助，已向全世界显示了一种新型的国际关系；苏联和中国外交政策的完全一致和两国在国际事务中的真诚的合作，对于保卫亚洲及世界和平和促进各国人民间的友好关系起着决定性的作用。
    去年中华人民共和国建国五周年的时候，苏联政府代表团访问了中国，中苏两国曾就中苏关系和国际形势的各项问题进行会谈，结果发表了关于中苏关系和国际形势各项问题的联合宣言以及其他重要宣言和公报。这些文件，标志着中苏两国人民的伟大友谊的进一步巩固和发展，表现了两国共同为保卫亚洲和世界的和平和安全的决心。在这里我们不能不想起三十年前，伟大的中国革命先行者孙中山先生在其致苏联中央执行委员会的遗书中，曾表达这样的期望：“两国在争世界被压迫民族自由之大战中，携手并进以取得胜利。”孙中山先生的理想，今天已完全实现。这使我们中国人民坚信：在我们沿着苏联所走过的光荣道路前进的时候，会永远得到苏联政府和人民的友好合作和援助，苏联人民永远是我们最可靠最忠实的朋友。热爱苏联，学习苏联，已在我国社会生活中形成持久高涨的热潮。我们全国人民继续发展和巩固中苏两国人民的友谊和兄弟般合作的愿望，已庄严地写进中华人民共和国的宪法里面了。
    现在，我们全国人民正在中国共产党和政府领导下，为解放台湾、消灭蒋介石卖国集团，粉碎美帝国主义侵略、保卫亚洲和平而斗争。苏联政府和人民一贯地给了我们以正义的支持，最近苏联在联合国安全理事会提出谴责美国侵略我台湾地区的提案，布尔加宁主席和莫洛托夫外长在最高苏维埃会议上的发言所宣示的严正立场，更给了我们很大的鼓舞，加强了我们胜利的信心。
    今天，我们庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订五周年，对于苏联政府和人民满怀感激的心情。我们要进一步地努力加强中苏两国人民的友谊，巩固两大国的伟大同盟，我们要更好地向苏联学习，我们解放台湾的斗争就一定胜利，我们建设社会主义的伟大事业就一定成功！
