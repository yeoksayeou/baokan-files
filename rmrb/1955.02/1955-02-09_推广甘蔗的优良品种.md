Promoting Superior Sugarcane Varieties

In order to improve the quality of raw sugarcane and increase its sugar content, state-owned sugar factories in Guangdong Province began promoting the Java 3016 sugarcane variety, which has a particularly high sugar content, on 4,300 mu of sugarcane-growing areas in the Pearl River Delta in 1953. Last year, they promoted it on more than 20,000 mu, estimating a yield of 9,000 jin of sugarcane per mu. Last December, the state-owned Shunde and Shitou sugar factories successively concentrated on pressing this variety of sugarcane and conducted comparative experiments with ordinary Java 2878 sugarcane. The results proved that the sugar content of Java 3016 sugarcane was 1.27-1.77% higher than that of Java 2878 sugarcane. If calculated based on an increase in sugar content of 1.27%, the increased sugar content of Java 3016 sugarcane produced in these two years can be used to produce more than 1,000 metric tons of white sugar, worth more than 9 billion yuan. It is planned to continue to promote this superior variety this year to increase sugar production for the country and supply the needs of the people. (Tang Bingde)

    推广甘蔗的优良品种
    广东省国营糖厂为了改进原料蔗的品质，提高原料蔗的含糖分，一九五三年开始在珠江三角洲蔗区推广了四千三百亩含糖分特高的爪哇三○一六号品种甘蔗，去年又推广了二万多亩，估计每亩可产九千斤甘蔗。去年十二月，国营顺德和市头两糖厂先后集中压榨该品种甘蔗同一般的爪哇二八七八号甘蔗作比较试验，结果证明：爪哇三○一六号甘蔗的含糖分比爪哇二八七八号甘蔗高出百分之一·二七—一·七七。如以提高含糖分百分之一·二七计，这两年所产的爪哇三○一六号甘蔗所增加的含糖分可制成白砂糖一千公吨以上，约值九十多亿元。计划今年将要继续推广这种优良品种，为国家增产更多的食糖，供给人民需要。　（唐秉德）
