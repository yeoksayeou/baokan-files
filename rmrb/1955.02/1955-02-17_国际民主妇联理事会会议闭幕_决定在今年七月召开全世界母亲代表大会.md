Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 15th: A press conference was held in Geneva on the 14th after the conclusion of the International Democratic Women's Federation Council meeting.

At the press conference, it was announced that representatives from women's organizations in forty-five countries had participated in the meeting. The slogan of the meeting was: Women of all countries and all nations, regardless of political or religious beliefs, unite to fight for the maintenance and consolidation of peace.

The meeting heard a report by Anne Minella, Secretary-General of the International Democratic Women's Federation, on the Federation's activities and women's struggle for their rights and world peace, and also heard a report by Eugénie Cotton, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the International Democratic Women's Federation.

Representatives from Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America spoke at the meeting about women's movements and mass movements in these countries, as well as the signature collection for petitions against the Paris Agreements, demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons, demanding universal disarmament, and demanding peaceful solutions to all international problems.

The meeting unanimously adopted the International Democratic Women's Federation's declaration in support of the resolutions of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council and passed a letter to women regarding the convening of the World Mothers' Congress for the Defense of Children in July this year.

The letter to women said: We know how happy it is to have children; but we also know how painful it will be to lose them. It is our responsibility to protect children so that they do not suffer from various disasters and from wars that contain all kinds of misfortunes.

Peace is now threatened again. War forces are trying to undermine the security of people of all countries by various means: the arms race, creating new international tensions in Asia, establishing military bases, remilitarizing West Germany in accordance with the London and Paris Agreements, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council has also decided to use atomic weapons in the event of war.

Every mother knows the cruelty of atomic bombs from Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Bikini Island. We cannot allow such weapons to be used again. When we unite with the powerful forces for peace around the world, we can take atomic weapons from the hands of those who threaten our children. We hope that the funds used to prepare for war will be used for peaceful purposes; that the greatest discovery of this century—atomic energy—will be used to reduce people's heavy labor and will only be a source of progress.

We call on women and mothers all over the world to unite and jointly defend our children, oppose war, and defend peace. We call on you to participate in the World Mothers' Congress to be held in July 1955.

    国际民主妇联理事会会议闭幕
    决定在今年七月召开全世界母亲代表大会
   【新华社十六日讯】据塔斯社日内瓦十五日讯：国际民主妇女联合会理事会会议结束后，十四日在日内瓦举行了记者招待会。
    招待会上宣布，参加这次会议的有四十五个国家的妇女组织的代表。这次会议的口号是：所有国家和所有民族的妇女，不分政治信仰和宗教信仰，团结起来为维护和巩固和平而斗争。
    会议听取了国际民主妇女联合会总书记安·米奈拉所作的关于联合会的活动和妇女争取自己权利和争取世界和平的斗争的报告，还听取了国际民主妇女联合会执行委员会主席欧仁妮·戈登的报告。
    在会上发言的欧洲、亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国的代表谈到了这些国家的妇女运动、群众运动、以及为反对巴黎协定、要求禁止原子武器、要求普遍裁减军备、要求和平解决一切国际问题的请愿书征集签名的情况。
    会议一致通过了国际民主妇女联合会关于支持世界和平理事会常务委员会决议的宣言，通过了关于在今年七月召开全世界母亲保卫儿童代表大会的告妇女书。
    告妇女书说：我们知道，有孩子是多么快乐；但是也知道，失去他们将是多么痛苦。我们的责任是要保护儿童，使他们不致遭到各种灾难和遭到包藏各种不幸的战争。
    和平现在又受到了威胁。战争势力企图用各种办法来破坏各国人民的安全：军备竞赛，在亚洲制造新的国际紧张局势，建立军事基地，根据伦敦和巴黎协定使西德重新军国主义化，北大西洋公约组织理事会还决定在一旦发生战争时使用原子武器。
    每一个母亲都从广岛、长崎和比基尼岛知道原子弹的残酷。我们不能容许这样的武器再被拿来使用。当我们和全世界的强大和平力量团结在一起以后，我们就能把原子武器从威胁我们孩子的那些人的手中夺下来。我们希望：把用来准备战争的经费用在和平目的上；把这个世纪的最伟大的发现——原子能用来减轻人们的繁重劳动，并且只把原子能作为进步的泉源。
    我们号召全世界的妇女和母亲们团结一致，共同保卫我们的孩子，反对战争，保卫和平。我们号召你们参加将在一九五五年七月举行的全世界母亲代表大会。
