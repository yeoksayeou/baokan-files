Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, February 20th: A mass rally against the Paris military accords was held in Berlin on the 19th. Representatives from all districts of Berlin attended the rally. The assembly unanimously adopted a resolution calling for strengthening the struggle against the ratification of the Paris Accords, and demanding that the members of the Bonn Bundestag be aware of their responsibility to the country and rise up against the Paris Accords.

    Otto Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic, delivered a speech at the rally. He reminded everyone that the Bonn Bundestag would be holding the second and third readings of the Paris Accords from February 24th to 26th. He pointed out that the policy of remilitarizing West Germany as stipulated in the Paris Accords posed a grave danger to the German people.

    Grotewohl condemned Adenauer's assertion that negotiations on the reunification of Germany would still be possible after the ratification of the Paris Accords. Grotewohl said: This deceptive argument has only one purpose, which is to get the Bundestag to pass the Paris Accords.

    Grotewohl described in detail the Soviet Union's proposals on the German question. He said: These proposals are in line with the national interests of the German people. These proposals point the way to peace and German unification. All the German people must take action and fight for the realization of the Soviet proposals.

    Grotewohl pointed out that an all-German agreement must be reached, as this is an important prerequisite for a peaceful resolution of the German question. Grotewohl called on all the German people, regardless of their political affiliation or religious belief, to unite against the Paris Accords and strive for an all-German agreement. Subsequently, Grotewohl put forward some suggestions to help peacefully resolve the German question:

    1. Both parts of Germany should jointly request the Four Powers to immediately hold a meeting to discuss the German question; if an agreement cannot be reached on this matter in the short term, each should separately request the Four Powers to hold such a meeting immediately;

    2. In order to facilitate the convening of the Four Power conference, both parts of Germany should reach an agreement on holding free all-German elections in 1955;

    3. The People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic and the Bundestag of the Federal Republic should promptly send delegations to each other to present their views on issues of vital importance to the German people to both parliaments;

    4. Undertake any other joint negotiations that would help the two parts of Germany reach an agreement and rapprochement;

    5. The German Democratic Republic welcomes all efforts by progressive and peace organizations and individuals in West Germany, as long as they advocate preventing the ratification of the Paris Accords, advocate an agreement between Germans and between the Four Powers, that is, advocate peace and the restoration of German unity;

    6. Promote the easing and elimination of tensions and incorrect perceptions that still exist between the two sides through the exchange of delegations and the holding of meetings.

    Grotewohl concluded by pointing out that these proposals would inevitably be supported by all peace-loving German people.

    格罗提渥在抗议巴黎协定的柏林群众大会上发表演说
    提出和平解决德国问题的建议
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社柏林二十日讯：十九日在柏林举行了一个抗议巴黎军事协定的群众大会，柏林各区的居民代表都出席了这个大会。大会一致通过决议，号召加强反对批准巴黎协定的斗争，要求波恩联邦议院的议员们意识到自己对国家的责任，起来反对巴黎协定。
    德意志民主共和国总理奥托·格罗提渥在大会上发表了演说。他提醒大家，从二月二十四日到二十六日波恩联邦议院就要对巴黎协定进行二读和三读。他指出：巴黎协定规定的使西德重新军国主义化的政策对德国人民有严重的危险。
    格罗提渥谴责了阿登纳所散布的在批准巴黎协定以后仍有可能举行关于恢复德国统一的谈判的论调。格罗提渥说：这种骗人的论调只有一个目的，就是要使联邦议院通过巴黎协定。
    格罗提渥详细地叙述了苏联提出的关于德国问题的建议。他说：这些建议是符合德国人民的民族利益的。这些建议指出了导致和平和德国统一的道路。全体德国人民必须行动起来为争取实现苏联的建议而进行斗争。
    格罗提渥指出：必须达成全德协议，因为这是和平解决德国问题的一个重要前提。格罗提渥号召全体德国人民，不问他们的政治派别和宗教信仰如何，联合起来反对巴黎协定，争取达成全德协议。随后，格罗提渥提出了一些有助于和平解决德国问题的建议：
    一、德国两个部分共同要求四大国立即举行会议讨论德国问题；如果在短期内不能就这件事达成协议，就分别要求四大国立即举行这种会议；
    二、为了便利四国会议的召开，德国两个部分应当就在一九五五年举行全德自由选举达成协议；
    三、德意志民主共和国人民议院和联邦共和国联邦议院应当迅速互派代表团，向两个议会提出它们对于德国人民的切身重大问题的看法；
    四、在任何其他方面举行有助于使德国两个部分取得协议和互相接近的联合谈判；
    五、德意志民主共和国欢迎西德的进步组织、和平组织及个人的一切努力，只要它们主张阻止批准巴黎协定，主张德国人之间和四大国之间达成协议，即主张和平和恢复德国的统一；
    六、通过互派代表团和举行会议的方法来促进缓和与消除还存在在双方之间的紧张状态和不正确的观念。
    格罗提渥最后指出：这些建议必然会得到所有爱好和平的德国人民的支持。
