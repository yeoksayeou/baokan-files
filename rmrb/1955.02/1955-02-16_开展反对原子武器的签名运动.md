    捷克斯洛伐克民族阵线中央行动委员会也在同一天发表了告人民书，号召全体公民全力执行他们在社会主义建设中的任务。告人民书说，很好地完成每一件工作，按时完成每一件工作，以及在生产方法上的每一个改进，都可以被看作是捷克斯洛伐克人民对争取和平和反对原子战争的斗争的有价值的贡献。
    蒙古人民共和国
   【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社乌兰巴托十四日讯：蒙古人民共和国顺利进行着在世界和平理事会常务委员会告全世界人民书上征集签名的运动。据不完全的材料，仅仅在乌兰巴托已经有六万三千七百四十四人签了名。
    印度尼西亚
   【新华社雅加达十五日电】印度尼西亚人民反对使用原子武器的签名运动已经在二月十三日开始。印度尼西亚全国和平委员会在这天发表了呼吁书，号召印度尼西亚全体人民积极在世界和平理事会常务委员会一九五五年一月十九日发表的反对准备原子战争的“告全世界人民书”上签名。
    呼吁书说，世界上某些有势力的集团，现在正在准备发动原子战争。他们运用了各种各样的诡计，设法使世界人民相信：为了解决困难的国际问题，原子战争是不可避免的。
    呼吁书指出，原子战争会给全人类带来极大的灾难，并且说，围绕世界的战争基地，已经在好几个地方接近我国领土的边界，这就使得我们印度尼西亚人不可能逃脱在下一次战争中由于使用原子武器所带来的后果。
    意大利
   【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社罗马讯：反对重新武装西德和原子战争威胁的抗议运动正在意大利全国各地展开。
    根据意大利和平理事会的倡议，意大利全国各地已先后举行了许多集会和示威，并展开为世界和平理事会常务委员会的“告全世界人民书”征集签名的运动。在意大利所有工业和行政中心城市，几乎都举行了盛大集会。意大利共产党和社会党的领导人们在会上讲了话。
    六千多个小土地所有者和农场工人在西埃那省蒙特皮尔西阿诺举行了集会。他们通过决议，要求
  “意大利上议院拒绝规定复活德国军国主义和进行原子战争的巴黎和伦敦协定”，并且谴责“意大利政府所奉行的战争、贫穷、经济和社会危机的政策”。拉温那省马萨伦巴达的失业职工和马彻拉塔省托伦丁诺的前游击战士也通过类似的决议。利古里亚、伦巴第、马尔切和加拉勃利亚的乡村也举行了许多集会，抗议准备原子战争和武装西德。
    劳动人民的代表团继续从全国各地到上议院来访问上议员，要求他们投票反对巴黎协定。罗马大学的一百三十名教师和其他人员也写信给上议院，要求拒绝巴黎协定。
