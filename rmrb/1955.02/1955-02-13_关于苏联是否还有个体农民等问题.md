	Regarding Whether There Are Still Individual Farmers in the Soviet Union, etc.
	Soviet Union, Li Klyuchnik
	Editor's Note: The following is a letter from the Theoretical Propaganda Department of the Soviet Pravda in response to Comrade Luo Qin of the Grain Bureau of Boluo County, Guangdong Province, China. After reading this letter, we can understand how the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union correctly treated the very small number of individual farmers in some areas, and at the same time, how to convince these individual farmers to take the road of collectivization. This is of great help to us in learning about the gradual realization of the socialist transformation of agriculture in our country. With the consent of the editorial department of Pravda, this newspaper publishes this letter here. Dear Comrade Luo Qin:
	You asked: (1) Are there still individual farmers in the Soviet Union? If so, what percentage do they account for compared to the total number of collective farmers?
	Yes, there are still individual farmers in the Soviet Union. They account for less than one percent of the total number of collective farmers. However, in those areas that belonged to the Soviet Union before 1939, due to the enormous work that the Soviet Communist Party had carried out in the countryside for many years after the Great October Socialist Revolution, there were no individual farmers before World War II. All the peasants who were formerly poor and middle peasants have joined the collective farms. As for the rich peasants, they had already been eliminated as a class during the period of overall collectivization from 1929 to 1932. In this part of the Soviet Union, people only mention individual farmers when comparing the new, wealthy, and civilized life of the collective farms with the distant and arduous past of the poor and middle peasant masses.
	The situation is different in the younger Soviet regions, that is, the small part of the Soviet Union where Soviet power was established only in 1939-1940. These regions are the western states of the Ukrainian Republic and the Belarusian Republic, the Izmail region of the Ukrainian Republic, Northern Bukovina, the Lithuanian Republic, the Latvian Republic, the Estonian Republic, and the part of the territory where Soviet power was established in 1945: the Transcarpathian Region and certain areas of the Karelian-Finnish Republic. Overall collectivization was also implemented in the above-mentioned areas. The basic masses of former poor and middle peasants have voluntarily joined the collective farms, and the class of rich peasants has also been eliminated. However, in these areas, there are still very few individual farmers. Among them are poor and middle peasants, but there are no more rich peasant exploiters, because the property of the rich peasants has been confiscated in the process of overall collectivization. In the above-mentioned areas, this small number of individual farmers accounts for a very small proportion of the population: they account for less than one percent of the total number of collective farmers in the entire Soviet Union.
	(2) After the construction of a socialist society, are individual farmers allowed to exist? What attitude do the Party and the government take towards them?
	If individual farmers exist as the dominant economy in a country's agriculture, this is incompatible with socialism, and socialism is unimaginable. But when the socialist economy has already been dominant in both cities and villages, socialism can be built, and it has already been built in the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union reached such a level by 1936, the year the new Soviet Constitution was passed—the Constitution of victorious socialism. The remnants of individual farmers are no longer the dominant force in the agricultural economy, and they have become so weak that they can no longer play any role in the agricultural economy, especially in the entire national economy of the Soviet Union.
	When the industrial base has laid the foundation for the collective farms, and the basic laboring masses in the countryside have, based on experience, believed that collective labor is far superior to individual labor, the time for overall collectivization has arrived. At this time, the basic laboring peasant masses voluntarily joined the collective farms and launched a struggle to eliminate the rich peasants as a class. But even after overall collectivization, after more than 90 percent of the poor and middle peasants have joined the collective farms, some of them will still remain individual farmers. This is not because these individual farmers are against the Soviet regime or the collective farm system, but because our Party and the Soviet organs have not done enough educational work for this small number of individual farmers, and have not completely convinced them that the road of collective farms is the only correct road to a happy life. That is why, in these areas where there are still individual farmers (only poor and middle peasants), the Soviet Communist Party requires its party organizations and Soviet government organs not to weaken but to strengthen their work for these farmers, in order to attract them to participate in collective farms.
	(3) At present, what is the attitude of the individual farmers in the Soviet Union towards the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government? How is their life compared to that of the collective farmers?
	Individual farmers support the Party and the government and support all the measures carried out in the collective farm countryside. In the Soviet countryside, just as in the cities, the new socialist relations of production have long occupied the dominant position and are being consolidated and developed day by day. Therefore, the fact that there are a small number of individual farmers in the Soviet Union—tomorrow's collective farmers—cannot deprive Soviet society of its socialist nature.
	But this does not mean that the Party and the government do not care about absorbing individual farmers into collective farms. On the contrary, in those areas where there are still individual farmers, various measures are being taken to convince them of the superiority of collective farms and to attract them to join collective farms.
	Undoubtedly, the individual farmers who still exist in the Soviet Union will eventually, based on experience, believe in the superiority of collective farm life and realize that life in collective farms is far superior to the life of individual farmers. The life of collective farmers is becoming more prosperous, civilized, and better year by year. In every republic, state, and any region of the Soviet Union, one can clearly see the guaranteed and civilized life of collective farmers. For example, let us take a collective farm far from Moscow, the "Red October" collective farm in the Turkmen-Kalin district of the Turkmen Republic, and see what this collective farm has and how the collective farmers live. In this cotton-planting collective farm, a multi-sector economy has been widely developed, the labor of all production sectors has been mechanized, and the efficiency of labor production is very high. In 1953, the average yield per hectare of long-staple cotton on a large area was 25.6 quintals, and the collective farm's annual income was 19.6 million rubles. Collective farmers can get 25 rubles in cash and more than three kilograms of wheat for each work day. Those collective farmers who did more than 1,000 work days received tens of thousands of rubles in cash income and many tons of grain. Before the establishment of the collective farm, individual farmers—middle or poor peasants—never had and could not have such income. Collective farmers cherish the collective farm not only because it has freed them from poverty, darkness, and ignorance forever, but also because only in the collective farm can farmers get rid of the primitive, outdated technology and excessively heavy labor. The two tractor teams of the Machine Tractor Station work in the above-mentioned collective farm, and these two teams have fully mechanized the labor of the collective farm. The collective farm has widely adopted advanced agricultural technology and reasonably and systematically utilized the labor force and finances of the collective farm. As a result of the mechanization of labor, the collective farm is able to develop a multi-sector economy. For example, the complete mechanization of soil cultivation before sowing, the work of tending cotton plants during the growing season, the excavation of irrigation canals, fertilization, and the mechanization ratio of cotton plant pulling are very high, which helps to draw a large amount of manpower to complete the work in the livestock farms, fields, orchards, vegetable gardens, and to complete the preparation of feed in a timely manner. Moreover, mechanization has also been widely adopted in these sectors. For example, trucks are used in the preparation of feed and the transportation of feed to open-air pastures. The farm itself owns 21 such trucks. As a result of the mechanization of labor, this collective farm can free up a part of the collective farmers from all agricultural work and organize them into a construction team, which is led by the construction technician of the collective farm.
	The wealth of other production sectors of this collective farm can be judged by the following figures: in 1953, this collective farm had 23,000 head of karakul sheep, and in 1954 it planned to increase to 30,000 head. In 1953, the sheep farm sold 6,600 karakul sheepskins and 57 tons of wool to the state, and in 1954, it was decided to sell 8,200 sheepskins and 61 tons of wool according to the plan. From this, it can be seen that the public wealth of the collective farm is increasing, and the farm is selling more and more valuable products to the state, ensuring that collective farmers get more and more cash and in-kind income year by year, and constantly improving their material and cultural life. Of course, not all collective farms work and live like the "Red October" collective farm. There are many collective farms that are wealthier than this farm, and the collective farmers there live even better. But there are also more collective farms that have not reached the level of the above-mentioned collective farm. However, the lives of all collective farmers in the Soviet state are incomparably better than those of individual farmers, and they all cherish the collective farm system; they have long believed that the great Lenin was absolutely correct when he pointed out: "Small-scale peasant economy cannot get rid of poverty" (Complete Works of Lenin, Russian Third Edition, Volume 24, page 540), if we retain this individual small-scale peasant economy for a long time, then "we are still threatened by inevitable destruction" (Complete Works of Lenin, Russian Third Edition, Volume 20, page 407). Lenin later said: "If the rural economy can develop further, then we must firmly guarantee that it can further transition to the next stage; and this further transition will inevitably be to gradually unite the most unprofitable and backward individual small-scale peasant economy and organize it into a communal and large-scale agricultural economy." (Selected Works of Lenin, Volume 7, People's Publishing House, page 130)
	The days are not far off when the few individual farmers who still exist will finally believe in the benefits of collective labor from the examples of existing collective farms, and like the vast majority of laboring farmers in the Soviet state, firmly and forever combine their future with collective farms, and enthusiastically support the collective farm system as if it were the most precious thing in their lives.

    关于苏联是否还有个体农民等问题
    苏联里·克留奇尼克
    编者按：下面是苏联真理报理论宣传部答复我国广东省博罗县粮食局罗钦同志的信。我们看了这封信可以理解苏联共产党和政府如何正确地对待部分地区为数极少的个体农民，同时如何使这些个体农民信服地走上合作化道路。这对我们学习我国逐步实现农业社会主义改造问题有很大帮助。本报征得真理报编辑部的同意把这封信发表在这里。敬爱的罗钦同志：
    您问道：（一）苏联是否还有个体农民？如果有，他们和集体农民总数相比占百分之几？
    是的，在苏联仍然还有个体农民。他们和集体农民总数相比还不到百分之一。然而，在那些一九三九年以前即属于苏联领土的地方，由于在伟大十月社会主义革命以后苏联共产党曾在农村里进行过多年的巨大工作，所以到第二次世界大战前，已经没有了个体农民。所有以前是贫农和中农的农民，都已参加了集体农庄。至于富农，则早在一九二九——一九三二年时期，在实行全盘集体化的基础上，就已被作为一个阶级消灭了。在这部分苏联土地上，苏联人只是在把集体农庄的新的、富裕的和文明的生活同贫农和中农群众的遥远的、艰苦的过去相比较时，才提到个体农民。
    在年轻的苏维埃地区，即到一九三九——一九四○年时才建立了苏维埃政权的那一小部分苏联领土，情况则不同了。这些地区是乌克兰共和国和白俄罗斯共和国的西部各州，乌克兰共和国的依兹迈意尔州北布科维纳，立陶宛共和国，拉脱维亚共和国，爱沙尼亚共和国和在一九四五年建立了苏维埃政权的那部分领土：即外喀尔巴阡州和卡累利阿—芬兰共和国的某些地区。在上述地区也实行了全盘集体化，以前的贫农和中农的基本群众已自愿地加入了集体农庄，而富农阶级也被消灭了。但是在这些地区内，还有很少的个体农民。在他们中间有贫农和中农，但已没有富农剥削者了，这是因为在全盘集体化进程中富农已被没收了财产。在上述地区内这部分为数很少的个体农户占人口比重极少：他们和全苏联集体农民总数相比还不到百分之一。
      （二）在建成社会主义社会之后，是否允许个体农户存在？党和政府对他们采取什么态度？
    如果在一个国家的农业中个体农户是作为占统治地位的经济而存在着，这就同社会主义不相容，而且，这样，社会主义也是不可想像的。但是当社会主义经济无论在城市或乡村中都已经居于统治地位的时候，社会主义是能够建成的，而且它已经在苏联建成了。苏联到一九三六年便已达到了这样的程度，那一年通过了新的苏联宪法——胜利的社会主义的宪法。个体农户的残余已不是农业经济中的统治力量，它们已经微弱到实际上早已不能对农业经济，尤其对苏联整个国民经济，起任何作用的程度了。
    当工业基地已为集体农庄奠定了基础，而农村中的基本劳动群众，根据经验已经相信集体劳动远优越于个体劳动时，全盘集体化的时间就到来了，这时基本的劳动农民群众便自愿地参加了集体农庄，并展开把富农作为一个阶级来消灭的斗争。但是即使在进行全盘集体化以后，在百分之九十以上的贫农和中农都加入了集体农庄以后，他们中间也会剩下一部分人仍然是个体农民。其所以如此，并不是因为这些个体农民反对苏维埃政权或集体农庄制度，而是因为我们的党和苏维埃机关对这部分为数很少的个体农民的教育工作还做得不够，还没有使他们彻底相信集体农庄的道路是走向幸福生活的唯一正确道路。这就是为什么在这些仍有个体农户（只是贫农和中农）的地区，苏联共产党要求自己的党组织和苏维埃政权机关对这部分农民不是削弱而是更加加强工作，以便吸引他们参加集体农庄的缘故。
      （三）目前，苏联的个体农民们对于苏联共产党和苏联政府抱怎样的态度？他们的生活比集体农民如何？
    个体农民们拥护党和政府，并支持集体农庄农村所进行的一切措施。在苏维埃农村里，也正如在城市一样，新的社会主义的生产关系早已占居统治地位，并在日益巩固和发展着。因此，在苏联存在有很少数的个体农民——明天的集体农民这件事实，是不能使苏维埃社会失掉它的社会主义的性质的。
    但是，这绝不是说，党和政府不关心吸收个体农民参加集体农庄。恰正相反，在那些仍有个体农民的地区，正采取各种措施来使他们信服集体农庄的优越性，并吸引他们加入集体农庄。
    无疑地，目前在苏联仍存在的个体农户，将来也会根据经验相信集体农庄生活的优越性，并了解到集体农庄的生活要远优越于个体农民的生活。集体农民的生活正在一年比一年更加富裕、文明和美好。在每一个共和国、州，在苏联的任何地区都可以明显地看到集体农民的有保障的、文明的生活。譬如，我们以离莫斯科很远的一个集体农庄，土库曼共和国的土库曼—卡林区“红色十月”集体农庄为例，看一下这个集体农庄里有些什么，集体农民生活得怎样。在这个植棉集体农庄里，已广泛地发展了多部门经济，所有生产部门的劳动已经机械化，因而劳动生产的效能很高。一九五三年在广大面积上长纤维棉花的平均单位面积产量是每公顷二十五点六公担，集体农庄每年的收入是一千九百六十万卢布。集体农民由每个劳动日可以获得二十五个卢布的现金和三公斤以上的小麦。那些做了一千个以上工作日的集体农民，得到了数万卢布的现金收入和好多吨的谷物。在集体农庄成立以前，个体农民——中农或贫农从来没有过、而且也不可能有这样的收入。集体农民所以珍视集体农庄还不仅是因为农庄使他们永远摆脱了贫困、黑暗和愚昧，而且是因为只有在集体农庄里农民才能摆脱那种原始的、陈旧的技术和过度繁重的劳动。机器拖拉机站的两个拖拉机工作队在上述这个集体农庄里工作，这两个工作队已使集体农庄的劳动充分机械化，集体农庄广泛采用了先进的农艺技术，合理地有计划地利用集体农民的劳动力和集体农庄的财务。实行劳动机械化的结果，使集体农庄能够发展多部门的经济。例如，播种前土壤耕作的全部机械化，棉株生长期的侍弄工作，引水渠的挖掘工作，施肥，拔棉株的机械化比重很高，这就帮助抽出了大量人力来及时地完成在饲畜场、田间、果园、菜园里的工作和完成饲料的准备工作。而且在这些部门中也广泛采用了机械化。例如，在准备饲料和把饲料运往露天牧场的工作上，已使用了载重汽车，这样的汽车，农庄本身便拥有二十一辆。劳动机械化的结果，使这个集体农庄能从所有农业工作中腾出一部分集体农民，把他们编成一个建筑工作队，而由集体农庄的建筑技术员负责领导。
    关于这个集体农庄其他生产部门的富裕情况，可由下列数字来判断：一九五三年这个集体农庄有卷毛绵羊两万三千头，一九五四年已计划增加到三万头。一九五三年饲羊场交售给国家六千六百张卷毛绵羊皮和五十七吨羊毛，一九五四年已决定按计划交售八千二百张羊皮和六十一吨羊毛。由此可见，集体农庄的公有财富正在增加，这个农庄把越来越多的珍贵产品交售给国家，保证集体农民逐年得到越来越多的现金和实物收入，并不断改善着他们的物质和文化生活。当然，并不是所有的集体农庄都是像“红色十月”集体农庄这样地工作和生活着。有不少集体农庄比这个农庄还富裕，那里的集体农民们生活得还要好些。但是也有更多的集体农庄还没有达到上述这个集体农庄的水平。可是，苏维埃国家所有的集体农民的生活都无可比拟地比个体农民好得多，并都珍视集体农庄制度；他们早已相信，伟大的列宁是绝对正确的，当时列宁曾指出：“小农经济是摆脱不了贫困的”（列宁全集，俄文第三版，二十四卷，五四○页），如果我们长时期保留这种个体的小农经济，那么“我们还是在受着不可避免的毁灭的威胁”（列宁全集，俄文第三版，二十卷，四○七页）。列宁在后来又说道：“如果农村经济能更往前发展，则我们须要坚强地保证它能更进一步过渡到下一阶段；而这个进一步的过渡，不可避免地将是把最无利的与最落后的个体小农经济逐渐联合起来，组织成为公社的、大规模的农业经济。”（列宁文集，第七册，人民出版社版，一三○页）
    目前仍存在的少数个体农民，从现有集体农庄的例子最后相信集体劳动的有利，也像苏维埃国家绝大多数劳动农民一样，把自己的将来牢固地、永远地同集体农庄结合在一起，并像对自己生活中最宝贵的东西一样，热心支持集体农庄制度，这样的日子，已经不远了。
