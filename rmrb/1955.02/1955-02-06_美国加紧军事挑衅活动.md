    Xinhua News Agency, February 5th: U.S. Far East Air Force Commander Partridge, who arrived in Taiwan on February 3rd, openly clamored at a press conference on the 4th that he would use force to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan. He said that U.S. Air Force planes were already "conducting patrol missions in the Taiwan Strait to familiarize themselves with the area." He announced that the U.S. was stepping up the delivery of Sabre jet fighters to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit air force. He even provocatively said: "We are ready to fight."
    Partridge has been conducting intensive activities to deploy U.S. Air Force units in Taiwan and to arrange coordinated operations between the U.S. Air Force and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit air force. After holding meetings with the heads of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit air force on the 4th, he also held meetings with the commanders of the U.S. 17th and 18th Interceptor Fighter Wings and inspected air force equipment in Taiwan.
    Partridge returned to Tokyo on the afternoon of the 4th. Now, U.S. Pacific Army Commander Clark followed closely behind, arriving in Taiwan on the 5th.

    美国加紧军事挑衅活动
   【新华社五日讯】二月三日到台湾的美国远东空军司令帕特里奇四日在记者招待会上公开叫嚣要以武力阻挠中国人民解放台湾。他说，美国空军的飞机已经在台湾海峡“执行巡逻任务，以使它们熟悉这个地区”。他宣布美国正在加紧把佩刀式喷气战斗机运交给蒋贼空军。他甚至挑衅地说：“我们准备作战”。
    帕特里奇进行了紧张的活动来部署在台湾的美国空军，布置美国空军和蒋贼空军的配合行动。他在四日和蒋贼空军的头领们举行了会议之后，又向美国第十七、第十八两个截击机联队的司令官举行了会议，并且视察了台湾的空军设备。
    帕特里奇已在四日下午回东京。现在，美国太平洋陆军司令克拉克又紧跟着在五日到了台湾。
