Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st: The Secretariat of the Japan Peace Liaison Committee issued a statement on February 1st regarding the "Normalization of Japanese-Soviet Diplomatic Relations," expressing its welcome to the Soviet government's proposal to the Japanese government to normalize Japanese-Soviet diplomatic relations.

The statement said, "We believe that in the current state of Japanese-Soviet relations, the Soviet Union's proactive adoption of such steps, as repeatedly stated in the joint declaration and other documents of the Soviet Union and China regarding relations with Japan, stems entirely from the Soviet Union's peaceful desire to ease international tensions."

The statement emphasized: "Regarding the Soviet government's proposal, we believe that the basic attitude that Japan should adopt must be: that no conditions should be attached to the start of negotiations, and consultations should begin first, with various outstanding issues discussed and resolved during the consultation process; negotiations must be conducted solemnly from the standpoint of Japanese independence and in the direction of strengthening Japan's autonomy, independence, and peaceful economy; negotiations should not be conducted against the backdrop of power politics but must be conducted in the spirit of peaceful coexistence and good-neighborly friendship; and all issues that help enhance the interests and friendly relations of both countries should be negotiated without hesitation."

The statement concluded: "Only by adopting such an attitude can normal diplomatic relations be restored, which not only conforms to Japan's interests but will also contribute to world peace."
    
Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 21st: The North Kyushu Conference for Restoring Japanese-Chinese-Japanese-Soviet Diplomatic Relations, representing the wishes of the people of the northern Kyushu region of Japan to restore diplomatic relations with China and the Soviet Union, held its inaugural meeting on the 18th in Tobata City, Fukuoka Prefecture.

Participants in the inaugural meeting included Yoshitaro Hirano, Vice President of the Japan-China Friendship Association, Tsutomu Majima, Secretary-General of the National Conference for Restoring Japanese-Chinese-Japanese-Soviet Diplomatic Relations, and approximately one hundred representatives from various labor unions and small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukuoka Prefecture.

The conference passed a resolution to send appeals to the assemblies of various prefectures, cities, towns, and villages in North Kyushu, demanding the restoration of Japanese-Chinese-Japanese-Soviet diplomatic relations.

    【新华社二十一日讯】东京消息：日本拥护和平委员会书记处曾在二月一日发表“关于日苏邦交正常化”的声明，对苏联政府向日本政府提出的使日苏邦交正常化的建议，表示欢迎。
    声明说，我们认为，在日苏关系的现状下，苏联主动率先采取这种步骤，正如苏中两国关于对日本关系的联合宣言和其他文件反复申明的那样，完全是出自苏联力图缓和国际紧张局势的和平愿望。
    声明强调说：对于苏联政府的建议，我们认为日本所应采取的基本态度必须是：对于开始谈判，不应附带条件，应该首先开始协商，在协商过程中讨论解决各项悬而未决的问题；谈判必须严正地站在日本独立的立场并在加强日本自主、独立与和平经济的方向下进行；谈判不应该以实力政策为背景来进行，而是必须本着和平共处和善邻友好精神来进行；凡有助于增进两国利益和友好关系的问题都应该毫不犹豫地进行谈判。
    声明最后说：只有采取这种态度才能恢复正常邦交，这不仅符合日本的利益，而且也将对世界和平有所贡献。
   【新华社二十一日讯】东京消息：代表日本九州北部地区人民要求恢复日中日苏邦交的意愿的北九州恢复日中日苏邦交会议，十八日在福冈县户畑市举行成立大会。
