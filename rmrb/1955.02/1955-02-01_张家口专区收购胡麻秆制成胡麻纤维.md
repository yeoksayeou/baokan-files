    Zhangjiakou Special District Acquires Flax Stalks to Produce Flax Fiber
    The supply and marketing cooperatives in Zhangjiakou Special District, Hebei Province, are actively acquiring flax stalks to process and produce flax fiber. Flax fiber can be used to weave cloth, make sacks, and water turbine bags. The supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels in Zhangjiakou Special District began acquiring flax stalks in November of last year. By mid-January, they had already acquired more than three million catties.
    In November of last year, the Zhangjiakou Special District Office of the Hebei Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative allocated more than 800 flax scutching machines to the supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties. The local supply and marketing cooperatives processed and produced fiber while acquiring flax stalks. According to the statistics of the supply and marketing cooperatives in four counties, by the beginning of January, they had already processed more than 15,000 catties of flax fiber. After the weather warms up and the ground thaws this spring, various localities will universally launch the work of processing flax fiber.

    张家口专区收购胡麻秆制成胡麻纤维
    河北省张家口专区的供销合作社积极收购胡麻秆，加工制取胡麻纤维。胡麻纤维可以用来织布，制麻袋和水轮袋。张家口专区各级供销合作社从去年十一月间展开胡麻秆收购工作，到一月中旬，已经收购三百多万斤。
    河北省供销合作社张家口专区办事处在去年十一月间拨给各县供销合作社八百多架轧麻机，各地供销合作社一面收购胡麻秆，一面就加工制取纤维。据四个县的供销合作社的统计，到一月上旬，已经加工胡麻纤维一万五千多斤。今春天暖解冻以后，各地将普遍展开加工胡麻纤维的工作。
