    Our People Firmly Oppose the Use of Atomic Weapons
    Signature Campaign Rapidly Expanding to Small Cities and Vast Rural Areas
     [Report from this newspaper] The large-scale signature campaign of our people against the use of atomic weapons is developing vigorously, and is rapidly shifting from large and medium-sized cities to small cities and vast rural areas.
    The signature campaign is developing most rapidly in major cities. Following the capital, the signature campaigns in Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou and other cities have basically concluded. Other large and medium-sized cities are carrying out the campaign in depth. The number of signatories in Tianjin reached 2,107,000, in Shanghai 5,343,000, in Nanjing 976,000, in Guangzhou 1,010,000, in Wuhan 1,100,400 by the 24th, in Shenyang 820,000 by the 23rd, in Chongqing nearly 1,100,000 by the 21st, and in Xi'an over 1,100,000 by the 22nd. The development of the signature campaign in various industrial cities is also very rapid. The signature campaign in the steel capital Anshan basically concluded on the 24th. The total number of signatories was 589,017, accounting for 85.5% of the city's total population. In the coal capital Fushun, more than 323,000 people had participated in the signature campaign by the 22nd. In Harbin, the number of signatories reached 1,075,800 in the past ten days, accounting for more than 80% of the city's total population, and the signature campaign has now basically concluded.
    In various large and medium-sized cities, the signature campaign first unfolded in factories, mining areas, construction sites, enterprises, government offices, and schools, and then rapidly expanded to the broad masses of citizens in streets and neighborhoods. In many industrial and mining enterprises, the number of employees who signed against the use of atomic weapons reached 99% of the total number of employees. 100% of the employees of Shanghai's twenty-three heavy industrial enterprises signed. In Wuhan, thousands of construction workers engaged in bridge exploration and levee construction on both sides of the Yangtze River enthusiastically signed. Tens of thousands of employees from more than one hundred units and their families at the construction site of the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant signed their names. The Yumen Oil Mine held a signature broadcast rally on the 22nd, and more than 15,000 employees and their families signed their names at the rally.
    In the frontier regions of the motherland, including Tibet, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and other provinces where ethnic minorities live, the signature campaign is also being carried out in depth. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, more than 100,000 people from Mongolian, Han, and Hui ethnic groups have signed their names. In Urumqi, Xinjiang Province, where thirteen ethnic groups reside, more than 32,000 people have signed their names. In Nanning, the capital of Guangxi Province and the capital of the Guixi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the people of the city, including more than ten ethnic groups such as Zhuang, Han, Dong, Miao, Yao, and Hui, have all joined the signature campaign. As of the 22nd, the number of signatories accounted for more than 80% of the city's total population. In Yunnan Province, which has many ethnic groups, 177,288 people had signed their names by the 23rd. The people in ten special districts in the province and the Dehong Dai-Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, the Honghe Hani Autonomous Prefecture, and the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture are responding to the call against the use of atomic weapons.
    Returned overseas Chinese in various places are also enthusiastically participating in the signature campaign. More than 1,000 returned overseas Chinese and relatives of overseas Chinese in Guangzhou held a signature rally on the 21st, and all those present signed the "Letter to the People of the World." More than 200 overseas Chinese who had just returned from Japan on the Japanese ship "Xingan Maru" on the 15th also held a signature rally. Many people had witnessed and experienced the disasters caused by atomic weapons in Japan and resolutely opposed the use of atomic weapons to slaughter humanity.
    Compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Macau have also published statements in newspapers, endorsing and supporting the call of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council against the use of atomic weapons.
