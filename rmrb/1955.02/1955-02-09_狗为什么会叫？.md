    "Why Do Dogs Bark?"
    Hujiano

    There was this study discussion meeting.

    At the beginning, everyone was silent for five minutes, seemingly without anything to say. The group leader repeatedly urged them, and someone spoke, but it was scattered and listless. But somehow, one question caught everyone's interest, and suddenly everyone became energetic, as if they had suddenly become extraordinarily clever. With the stimulating effect of strong tea, sparks of wisdom flashed from many mouths. Some cited classics, some talked about perceptual knowledge, some offered supplementary insights... The speeches were truly both enthusiastic and lively.

    What was the question that everyone was so interested in? It was the question of why dogs bark.

    "One of my new realizations from this trip to the countryside is that dogs – these things are truly detestable!" An intellectual comrade wearing glasses said indignantly, "In the countryside, you can't walk without a stick. From one village to another, dogs bark at you everywhere. If you walk in the dark, a ball of furry stuff pounces on you from the shadows and suddenly barks at you, it's really frightening. One time…"

    "Ha, you can only blame your neurasthenia!" A comrade not wearing glasses immediately interrupted him, disagreeing: "The peasant brothers in the countryside hear dogs barking all day long, and I haven't seen many people losing their nerve. Isn't the dog mankind's earliest and most loyal companion?" "Yes! From the perspective of the ancients creating characters," a comrade with slightly balding hair added, "the dog is 'quan' (犬). The character '犬' is a person with a dot beside it, which shows the close historical relationship between dogs and humans." He took a sip of strong tea and then brought up the topic again, "However, no matter what kind of dog, it always likes to bark, which is really annoying. What do you all think, why do dogs bark?"

    "No," a young comrade had a different opinion: "There are also dogs that don't like to bark. There is a type of floppy-eared, curly-haired Western dog that doesn't like to bark. It always follows strangers quietly, and suddenly bites you without making a sound."

    "You're talking about a German Shepherd! A German Shepherd hasn't changed its wolfish nature, it always pounces on people silently from behind, ah-ya-ya, this kind of dog is the most detestable!" "A dog that bites doesn't bark, a dog that barks doesn't bite, that's how it is!"

    "There are always more dogs that like to bark. I think a dog's barking is its nature, just like people have to talk."

    Everyone's enthusiasm for discussion was high, and the debate was quite lively. I simply couldn't remember which comrade said which sentence or which argument. In short, regarding the question of why dogs bark, some said it was due to heredity, some said it was because their noses were stimulated and itchy, so they had to bark, some said it was because they inherently had a fondness for barking…

    How long did this discussion last? Look, the tea in everyone's cups had long been brewed into pale water. Everyone was clearly feeling tired. But how could the discussion end hastily at this point? Besides, when a discussion reaches a certain point, it should reach a more unified opinion! So, the group leader quickly seized the time to solicit everyone's opinions. At this time, everyone looked at each other in a daze. Only one person who maintained a relatively clear mind suggested that the group leader give a preliminary opinion. I don't know if the group leader was deliberately joking, but his preliminary opinion was: The reason dogs bark is probably because of their fondness for it. "I agree." "I have no opinion!"

      Everyone was already drowsy and just wanted to finish the meeting and rest. Therefore, they vaguely expressed their "agreement." The discussion on the question of why dogs bark finally came to an end.

    Reader comrades, do you want to know what the original topic of this group's discussion was? Well, it was "Why it is necessary to carry out socialist transformation of agriculture." It turned out that the participants in this discussion were all people who were said to have a lot of book knowledge. They felt that the general principles had already been understood and there was nothing to discuss; no one wanted to raise difficult questions, as if there were no difficult questions at all. What was lacking was perceptual knowledge, so everyone talked about perceptual knowledge. Because someone talked about the actual situation in the countryside, then someone talked about their experiences working in the countryside, from working in the countryside to talking about the dual nature of peasants, from the dual nature to talking about the selfish and conservative manifestations of peasants, talking about the large number of dogs in the countryside, whether farmers raising dogs to guard their homes was related to selfish and conservative ideas... In this way, the discussion went around and around to dogs, and everyone was no longer clear about what the original topic of discussion was.

    Readers, you may find such a study discussion meeting funny. However, please allow me to boldly guess that this kind of discussion meeting that is miles away from the topic will definitely not be "one of a kind." Although they may not all be about the question of dog barking, let's hope there are no more such study discussion meetings!

### “狗为什么会叫？”

    “狗为什么会叫？”
    呼加诺
    有这么一次学习讨论会。
    开始时，大家各自静默五分钟，似乎无言可发。小组长再三催促，有人发言了，也是零零落落，无精打采。但不知怎么一来，有一个问题引起了大家的兴趣，于是大家忽然精神抖擞，好像人突然变得格外聪明，加以浓茶的刺激作用，智慧的火花，从许多嘴里不断地闪射出来。有的引经据典，有的谈感性知识，有的说补充体会……发言真是既踊跃而又热烈。
    大家这样感到兴趣的问题是什么问题呢？这就是狗为什么会叫的问题。
    “我这次下乡的一个新的体会，就是：狗——这东西真是可恶！”一位戴眼镜的同志愤慨地说：“在乡下，你要不拿一根棍子，简直就不能走路，从这个庄到那个庄，到处狗都朝你汪汪地叫。若是走黑路，从暗中扑过来一团毛茸茸的东西，突然汪地一声向你偷袭过来，真会吓得毛骨悚然。有一回……”
    “哈，那只能怨你神经衰弱！”一位不戴眼镜的同志马上打断他，提出异议：“乡下的农民弟兄，成天听到狗叫，也没看见几个人吓掉胆的。难道狗不是人类最早和最忠实的伴侣吗？”“是啊！从古人造字上说，”一位头发已经微秃的同志补充说：“狗者犬也。‘犬’字是一人傍加一点，这就说明狗和人类有着密切的历史关系。”他呷了一口浓茶，又提起话题说：“不过，不管什么狗总是喜欢汪汪地叫，的确是叫人讨厌的。你们说说看，狗为什么会叫呢？”
    “不，”一位年青的同志又有了不同的意见：“也有不喜欢叫的狗：有一种贴耳卷毛的西洋狗，就不喜欢叫，它总是悄悄地跟在生人背后，冷不防咬你一口，可就不叫一声。”
    “你说的是狼狗吧！狼狗就是狼性未改嘛，总是闷声不响从人背后猛扑过来，啊呀呀，这种狗最可恶！”“咬人的狗不叫，叫的狗不咬，是这样子的！”
    “喜欢叫的狗总是多的，我看，狗要叫，是天性，就如人非说话不可。”
    大家谈兴正浓，辩论相当热烈，我简直记不清哪句话，哪个论点是哪位同志说的了。总之，关于狗为什么会叫的问题，有的说是由于遗传，有的说是因为它的鼻子受刺激奇痒，不得不叫，有的说是因为它本来就有叫的嗜好……
    这样的讨论有多久啦？请看大家茶杯里的茶，早就冲成淡白水了。大家显然都感到疲倦了。可是讨论到这，怎能草草结束？再说，讨论到一个地方，总应该取得较一致的意见呀！于是，组长赶紧抓紧时间征求大家意见。大家这时却浑浑噩噩地彼此看着。只有一个保持较清醒头脑的人提出请组长说个初步意见。也不知组长是否存心给大家开玩笑，他的初步意见是：狗所以会叫，大概是由于它的嗜好。“我同意。”“我没有意见！”
      大家都已昏昏沉沉，只希望赶快散会休息。因此就糊糊涂涂地表示了“同意”。关于狗为什么会叫的问题的讨论，至此，总算告一段落了。
    读者同志，你们要知道这个小组原来讨论的题目么？喏，这是“为什么必须对农业实行社会主义改造”。原来参加这个讨论会的，都是一些据说是很有书本知识的人。他们觉得大道理早已懂得，没什么可讨论的；谁也不愿意提出疑难问题，好像根本就没有什么疑难问题。缺少的是感性知识，于是大家就来谈感性知识。因为有人谈到农村的实际情况，接着就有人讲起自己下乡工作的体会，从下乡谈到农民的两重性，从两重性谈到农民的自私保守的表现，谈到农村狗多，农民养狗看家是否和自私保守观念有关……就这样七转八转的讨论到狗的身上来，而最初的讨论题目是什么大家也不甚了然了。
    读者们，你们也许觉得这样的学习讨论会很好笑。不过，请允许我大胆地猜测一下，这种离题万里的讨论会，绝不会“只此一家，别无分号”的，虽然不一定都是谈狗叫的问题。但愿不再有这样的学习讨论会！
