To the Editor:

    The management of aquatic products in the Suzhou area of Jiangsu Province is very chaotic, causing many unnecessary losses to state assets. The Suzhou Branch of the state-owned Jiangsu Provincial Aquatic Products Company is a specialized aquatic product management organization. The Jiangsu Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the Suzhou Native Produce Company Management Department also handle fish wholesale business. The leading authorities have designated operating areas for them. The Suzhou Branch organizes sources of goods according to regulations. However, because many cooperatives and state-owned commercial departments, and even aquatic product companies from other provinces, promote aquatic products in the Suzhou area at will, the sales market of the Suzhou Branch has been squeezed, resulting in a large backlog of aquatic products. For example, before the Spring Festival this year, the Anhui Provincial Aquatic Products Company and the Changzhou Office and Wuxi Branch of the Jiangsu Provincial Aquatic Products Company, without any procedures, promoted salted fish in Changshu and other counties of the Suzhou Special District. Because the price was cheap, they took away the business of the Suzhou Branch. This phenomenon of unplanned and blind promotion has existed for a long time, but it has not attracted the attention of the relevant authorities. Last year, after Jiangsu, Anhui, and other regions suffered from floods, many cooperatives and aquatic product companies rushed to Suzhou City and the Suzhou area to promote aquatic products. Due to the crowded market and the inability to sell goods, some units lowered prices to compete with each other. The Sihong County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Anhui Province blindly transferred 240,000 jin of salted fish to Suzhou City for promotion from July to November last year, and it had not been sold out by the beginning of February this year. Because the quantity of goods was large, the storage time was long, and the storage was not good, more than 40,000 jin of salted fish deteriorated, 30,000 jin were sold at a price reduced from more than 3,000 yuan per jin to 700-800 yuan, and more than 10,000 jin of salted fish completely rotted, resulting in a large loss.

    Because its own sales market was occupied by promotion units from other places, the Suzhou Branch also went to other regions to promote sales. During the Spring Festival this year, the Suzhou Branch went to Jiashan County, Zhejiang Province, to promote salted fish, which disrupted the local fish product promotion plan and also increased costs and increased the burden on consumers. As a result, disputes and "lawsuits" frequently occurred between the promotion units. From July last year to February this year, there were more than 30 disputes between the Suzhou Branch and promotion units from other places. As a result of the quarrel, the problem was not resolved. Because the Suzhou Branch imported more fish products and sold less, by February 10, the inventory backlog of salted fish reached one million jin. Some salted fish were left outside the warehouse and inevitably rotted.

    This year's spring fishing season is coming, and a large number of yellow croaker are about to be on the market. If the situation of blind promotion and mutual competition is not resolved immediately, the fish product market will be even more chaotic.

### 严格遵守鱼产销售市场的统一安排

    严格遵守鱼产销售市场的统一安排编辑同志：
    江苏省苏州地区水产品的经营情况非常混乱，使国家财富受到了许多不应有的损失。国营江苏省水产公司苏州支公司是专门经营水产的机构，江苏省供销合作社和苏州土产公司经理部也经营鱼类批发业务，领导机关曾给他们划分了经营地区。苏州支公司是按照规定组织货源的，但是，由于许多合作社和国营商业部门，甚至连外省的水产公司等单位都随便到苏州地区推销水产品，以致苏州支公司的销售市场被挤掉了，造成水产品大量积压。例如，在今年春节前，安徽省水产公司和江苏省水产公司常州办事处、无锡支公司等单位，不通过任何手续就到苏州专区常熟等县推销咸鱼，因为价格便宜，便把苏州支公司的生意拉去了。这种无计划地盲目推销的现象，在很早以前就存在着，不过并没有引起有关机关重视。去年，江苏、安徽等地区遭受水灾以后，许多地区的合作社和水产公司就纷纷到苏州市和苏州地区来推销水产品。由于市场拥挤，商品销不出去，有些单位就降低价格互相竞售，安徽省泗洪县供销合作社在去年七月至十一月间，盲目调运咸鱼二十四万斤到苏州市推销，直到今年二月上旬还没有卖掉。因为商品数量多，积存时间长，保管不善，有四万多斤咸鱼变质，三万斤由每斤三千多元降为七、八百元出售，一万多斤咸鱼全部腐烂，损失很大。
    苏州支公司由于自己的销售市场被外地的推销单位占去了，于是也到其他地区进行推销。今年春节时，苏州支公司就曾到浙江嘉善县去推销咸鱼，这样又打乱了当地鱼产品的推销计划，而且也提高了成本，增加了消费者的负担。这样做的结果，各推销单位经常发生争吵和“打官司”的现象。从去年七月至今年二月，苏州支公司和外地推销单位发生的纠纷就有三十多件。争吵的结果，问题并没有得到解决。因为苏州支公司的鱼产进得多，卖得少，到二月十日为止，库存积压咸鱼达一百万斤。有部分咸鱼丢在仓库外面，难免腐烂。
    今年的春汛就要来了，大批黄鱼即将上市，如果那种盲目推销、相互竞售的状况不立即解决，鱼产市场将会更加混乱。
