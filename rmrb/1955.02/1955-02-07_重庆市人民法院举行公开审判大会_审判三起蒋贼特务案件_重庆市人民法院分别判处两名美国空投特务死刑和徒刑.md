The Chongqing People's Court held a public trial rally at the Chongqing Labor People's Cultural Palace on January 20th. In front of more than 20,000 people, it publicly tried two cases of Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents and announced the handling of another counter-revolutionary, Chen Deji.

The first publicly sentenced case involved the criminals Wang Shushen, Tang Hu, Luo Bowen, and Tang Lunpu, who were dispatched by the Chiang Kai-shek secret service "Mainland Work Office of the Ministry of National Defense" to infiltrate and carry out counter-revolutionary activities. In December 1950, Wang Shushen fled to Hong Kong and joined the Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret service. Introduced by Tang Wei, a secret agent of the "Sichuan-Kang Guerrilla Headquarters," he joined the so-called "Mainland Work Office of the Ministry of National Defense" secret service organization, serving as a "Sichuan-Kang military liaison officer." In June 1952, Wang was ordered to infiltrate Sichuan, attempting to contact the remaining bandit "guerrilla forces" to organize riots, probe for intelligence, and concurrently collect intelligence for Chiang Kai-shek's "Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Ministry of the Interior." In November, he sneaked into Chongqing to carry out counter-revolutionary sabotage activities, drafting "communication" and "guerrilla" plans, vainly attempting to establish "communication stations" in Kunming, Guiyang, Chengdu, and other places. He also collected military, political, economic, and other intelligence on a large scale, secretly reporting it to the secret service agency in Hong Kong on many occasions. Wang also accepted Tang Wei's secret entrustment to falsely report the activities of the so-called Sichuan-Kang Shi Chongyang (Shi was arrested earlier in 1950) and other bandit units to the secret service agency in Hong Kong multiple times. Tang Hu, since being colluded with by Wang Shushen in Wanxian in November 1952 to act as an intelligence officer, has collected intelligence on a large scale. From November 1952 to November 1953, he reported intelligence to the Chiang Kai-shek "Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Ministry of the Interior" secret service agency multiple times. Tang Lunpu had known Wang Shushen for a long time and used his address as a contact point for Wang to communicate with other secret agents. In the summer of 1953, he was ordered by Wang to send three pieces of intelligence to Hong Kong and actively assisted Wang in finding targets for secret agents. Luo Bowen was a fugitive landlord. After being colluded with by Wang in early January 1953 to act as an intelligence officer, he was ordered by Wang to sneak into western and northern Sichuan to seek contact with the remaining bandit "guerrilla forces." After failing to achieve his goal and returning to Chongqing, he was taken in and disciplined by the government because the masses reported that he was a fugitive landlord, and he was given travel expenses to return to his hometown for production. Under the influence of the People's Government, Luo surrendered to the public security organs and exposed Wang Shushen's counter-revolutionary activities. According to the crimes of each perpetrator, the Chongqing People's Court sentenced Wang Shushen to death, Tang Hu to life imprisonment, and Tang Lunpu to ten years of imprisonment in accordance with the law. Because Luo Bowen was able to turn back and surrender, and exposed Wang's counter-revolutionary crimes, showing a sincere repentance and a desire to atone for his crimes, he was leniently exempted from punishment.

The second publicly sentenced case involved the reactionary leaders Meng Enpu and Ding Chichang, who, under the instructions of U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek secret agents, used reactionary secret societies to carry out counter-revolutionary armed rebellions. Before the liberation of Sichuan, Meng Enpu and Xia Dezheng, another bandit leader of the reactionary secret society "Tongshan Society," used the reactionary secret society to organize counter-revolutionary armed forces in Tongjiang, Nanjiang, Bazhong, and other counties in northern Sichuan. Meng acted as the "Commander of the Advance Column," attempting to stubbornly resist. Seeing that Chiang Kai-shek's situation was hopeless, Meng, in order to preserve his strength, pretended to be progressive in early 1950, impersonated a democratic person, stole the identity of a representative of the Nanchong People's Congress, and secretly instructed his subordinates to continue to control armed forces and carry out counter-revolutionary activities in northern Sichuan. In October of the same year, Meng participated in the "Army Formation Plan" transmission meeting convened by Cheng Ziqin, a leader of the "Tongshan Society," in Chongqing. He was appointed as the "Commander and Military Commander of the First Route of the Third Front Army of the Chinese National Salvation Army" and accepted the task of organizing two armies, receiving the bandit army flag pattern, a riot declaration, and other counter-revolutionary documents and activity funds. He also agreed with the bandit Cheng on the date of the riot. After returning to Nanchong, Meng arranged for bandits to go to various places to organize people and guns to carry out riots. Ding Chichang consistently used reactionary secret societies to amass wealth, spread rumors to confuse the public, and harm the people. Before liberation, he actively participated in the armed riot organized by Meng. Later, he fled back to Mudong, Baxian, participated in the "Tongshan Society" bandit leader's "riot meeting," and went to Fuling to collude with Wu Jincheng, commander of the "Eastern Sichuan Bandit Suppression and Anti-Communist Army" and a "Tongshan Society" bandit leader, to organize riots. Later, this group of bandits was annihilated by the People's Liberation Army, and Ding sneaked into Chongqing and participated in bandit leader Cheng Ziqin's "Army Formation Plan" transmission meeting. He accepted the task of organizing three regiments of bandit troops and went to Fengjie, Wushan, and Wuxi in eastern Sichuan in November 1950 to carry out army organization activities, while developing more than 20 "Tongshan Society" core members. During the suppression of the counter-revolutionaries, Ding forged a pass and fled, refusing to surrender. The Chongqing People's Court sentenced the counter-revolutionary Meng Enpu to death and Ding Chichang to life imprisonment.

At the meeting, the handling of another counter-revolutionary criminal, Chen Deji, was also announced. Chen Deji originally ran a bookstore in Shanghai. In 1950, he went to Hong Kong to do business. In early 1954, he lost his job and wanted to return to the country to live. In February, he was bought by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique's "Bureau of Investigation and Statistics" secret service agency in Hong Kong with money and became a secret agent sent back to the country. He had received secret agent training, including intelligence collection and secret writing, and obtained secret writing powder. The secret service agency immediately gave him the title of "Lieutenant Colonel" and ordered him to sneak into Chongqing to collect various intelligence, develop a secret agent organization, build a secret radio station, and contact the secret service agency stationed in Hong Kong. After receiving the order, Chen received activity funds and sneaked into Chongqing in June of the same year, delivering multiple pieces of intelligence related to politics, economy, culture, and education to the Chiang Kai-shek secret service agency stationed in Hong Kong. The Chongqing People's Court should have severely punished Chen Deji, but because he was utilized and bought by the Chiang Kai-shek secret service agency and showed remorse during the trial, he was leniently sentenced to five years of imprisonment.

The Chongqing People's Court recently handled a case of espionage by the United States "Central Intelligence Agency" affiliated "Free China Movement Headquarters," which was investigated by the public security organs and publicly prosecuted by the Municipal People's Procuratorate. The criminals were Chen Di (alias Chen Yiping, espionage code R515) and Liu Changfu (alias Liu Kemin, espionage code C136).

Chen Di and Liu Changfu were originally military-industrial personnel of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique. In 1950, they fled to Hong Kong. In 1951, they were recruited by the Hong Kong-based espionage agency of the United States "Central Intelligence Agency" affiliated "Free China Movement Headquarters" and were sent in batches by plane to the "Free China Movement" Communications School and Military and Political Cadre School, U.S. spy training institutions located in Chigasaki City, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, and Saipan Island in the Pacific Ocean. Under the leadership of U.S. spy principal Jackson, they received training in espionage techniques such as telecommunications codes, meteorological measurement, map surveying, and armed rebellion. In August 1952, under the direct leadership of U.S. spies, they and two other spies formed the "Sichuan Action Group," with Chen Di as the group leader and Liu Changfu as the deputy group leader, and began to discuss the action plan for airdropping into Sichuan and selecting an "airdrop site." It was decided that Chen and Liu would be airdropped first. After establishing contact, a second airdrop would be carried out, and they were given U.S.-made radios, submachine guns, pistols, bullets, activity funds, meteorological measurement instruments, maps, and forged letters of introduction and passes. They were also "instructed" to recruit reactionaries and develop a secret agent organization after landing, and to establish contact with bandit "guerrilla forces" in order to establish a "guerrilla base" to carry out "armed rebellion." They were also required to collect our military and political intelligence and contact the "Free China Movement Headquarters" in order to respond to the continued dispatch of airdropped secret agents. On the afternoon of January 27, 1953, the criminals Chen Di and Liu Changfu took a four-engine plane without national insignia from Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Japan, and secretly airdropped into northern Sichuan that night. Later, they were discovered and arrested by our military and civilians, and the U.S.-made radios, weapons, ammunition, activity funds, and various forged documents they carried were seized.

The Chongqing People's Court sentenced the spy Chen Di, whose crimes were extremely serious, to death in accordance with the law. For the criminal Liu Changfu, whose crimes were also serious, but who was able to sincerely express remorse during the trial, a lenient sentence of fifteen years of imprisonment was imposed.　（Our Sichuan Reporter Station）

    审判三起蒋贼特务案件
    重庆市人民法院分别判处两名美国空投特务死刑和徒刑
    重庆市人民法院一月二十日在重庆市劳动人民文化宫举行公开审判大会，在两万多群众面前，公开审判了两个蒋贼特务案件，并宣布了对另一个反革命犯陈德骥的处理。
    第一个公开判处的案件，罪犯是受蒋贼特务机关“国防部大陆工作处”派遣潜伏进行反革命活动的特务王树深、唐浒、罗博文、唐伦普。王犯树深在一九五○年十二月潜逃香港，投奔蒋匪特务机关，经特务“川康游击总指挥”唐伟介绍，加入所谓“国防部大陆工作处”特务组织，充当“川康军事联络员”。一九五二年六月王犯受命潜入四川，企图联络残余土匪“游击武装”组织暴乱，刺探情报，并兼负给蒋贼“内政部调查统计局”搜集情报任务。十一月，潜来重庆进行反革命破坏活动，拟订“通讯”、“游击”计划，妄图在昆明、贵阳、成都等地建立“通讯站”，并曾大肆搜集军事、政治、经济等情报，密报给香港特务机关多次。王犯并受唐伟密托，代唐向在港特务机关虚报捏造的所谓川康石重阳（石犯早于一九五○年被捕）等匪部活动情况多次。唐犯浒自一九五二年十一月在万县为王犯树深勾结充当情报员后，即大肆搜集情报，从一九五二年十一月到一九五三年十一月的一年中，向蒋贼
  “内政部调查统计局”特务机关报告情报多次。唐犯伦普早与王犯树深相识，把自己的住址作为王犯与其他特务联系转信的地点，一九五三年夏季又受王犯之命代发情报三件至香港，并积极协助王犯物色特务对象。罗犯博文是一个逃亡地主，一九五三年一月初被王犯勾结充当情报员后，曾受王犯之命先后潜往川西、川北一带寻觅联络残余土匪“游击武装”。未达到目的返回重庆后，因群众检举他是逃亡地主，被政府收容管教，并发给路费，令其返乡生产。罗犯在人民政府的感召下，遂向公安机关自首，并揭发了王犯树深的反革命活动。重庆市人民法院根据各犯的罪行，依法判处王犯树深死刑、唐犯浒无期徒刑、唐犯伦普十年徒刑；对罗犯博文，因其尚能回头自首，并揭发了王犯的反革命罪行，有真诚悔过立功赎罪的表现，特从宽免予处刑。
    第二个公开判处的案件，罪犯是接受美蒋特务指示，利用反动会道门组织，进行反革命武装叛乱的反动道首蒙恩普、丁炽昌。蒙犯恩普在四川解放前夕，和反动会道门“同善社”另一匪首夏德徵利用反动会道门，在川北通江、南江、巴中等县组织反革命武装，蒙犯充当“挺进纵队司令”，企图顽抗。后见蒋贼大势已去，蒙犯为保存实力，在一九五○年初伪装进步，冒充民主人士，窃取南充市人民代表身分，暗中仍指使他部下继续控制武装力量，在川北一带进行反革命活动。同年十月，蒙犯参与了“同善社”道首成子钦在重庆召集的“组军计划”传达会议，被任为“中华保国救民军”第三方面军第一路总指挥兼军长，接受了组织两个军的任务，领取了匪军军旗图样、暴动宣言及活动计划等反革命文件和活动经费，并同成匪议定暴动日期。蒙犯返回南充后，即布置匪徒分赴各地组织人、枪，进行暴乱。丁犯炽昌一贯利用反动会道门敛财，造谣惑众，危害人民；解放前曾积极参与蒙犯组织的武装暴乱活动。后逃回巴县木洞，参与“同善社”匪首“暴乱会议”，又往涪陵勾结“川东讨贼反共军”司令、
  “同善社”匪首吴锦成组织暴乱。后该股匪为解放军歼灭，丁犯又潜来重庆，参与了匪首成子钦的“组军计划”传达会议，受领了组织三个团的匪军任务，即于一九五○年十一月到川东奉节、巫山、巫溪一带进行组军活动，同时发展了“同善社”骨干二十余名。在镇压反革命运动中，丁犯伪造通行证潜逃，一直拒不自首。重庆市人民法院判处反革命分子蒙恩普死刑、判处丁炽昌无期徒刑。
    会上接着又宣布了对于另外一个反革命罪犯陈德骥的处理。陈犯德骥原在上海经营书报社，一九五○年前往香港经商，一九五四年年初失业，又欲回国居住。二月间，被蒋介石卖国集团“保密局”在香港的特务机关用金钱收买，充当派遣回国的特务爪牙，并曾受搜集情报、密写等特务训练，领得密写药粉。这个特务机关随即委他以“中校”头衔，令其潜入重庆，搜集各种情报，发展特务组织，筹建秘密电台，同驻香港特务机关联系。陈犯受令后，领得活动经费，于同年六月潜入重庆，先后给蒋贼驻香港特务机关递送有关政治、经济及文教等情报多次。重庆市人民法院本应对陈犯德骥严予惩处，惟因其系被蒋贼特务机关所利用收买、且在审讯中有悔悟表现，特从轻判处有期徒刑五年。

    重庆市人民法院最近依法处理了一个经公安机关侦察属实、由市人民检察院公诉的美国“中央情报局”所属“自由中国运动总部”间谍机关空投的特务间谍案件。罪犯是陈涤（化名陈一平，间谍代号R五一五号）、刘昌富（化名刘克敏，间谍代号C一三六号）。
    陈涤、刘昌富两个罪犯原来都是蒋介石卖国集团的军工人员，一九五○年潜逃香港，一九五一年先后为美国间谍机关“中央情报局”所属“自由中国运动总部”在香港的间谍机关搜罗，并分批用飞机送到日本神奈川县茅崎市和太平洋塞班岛的美国间谍训练机构“自由中国运动”通讯学校及军政干部学校，在美国特务校长贾克逊主持下，接受电讯密码、气象测量、地图测绘、武装暴乱等特务间谍技术训练。一九五二年八月在美国间谍直接领导下，和另两名特务编成“四川行动组”，由陈涤充当组长，刘昌富充当副组长，着手讨论空投四川的行动计划和选择“空投场”，决定陈、刘二匪先行空投，取得联系后，再进行第二次空投，并发给他们美制电台、冲锋枪、手枪、子弹、活动经费、气象测量仪器、地图及伪造的介绍信、通行证等，并“指示”他们，在空投着陆后搜罗反动分子、发展特务组织，并同土匪“游击武装”取得联系，以建立“游击根据地”，进行“武装暴乱”；还要搜集我军政情报，并和“自由中国运动总部”取得联系，以接应继续派遣的空投特务分子。一九五三年一月二十七日下午，罪犯陈涤、刘昌富由日本东京羽田机场乘不标明国籍徽号的四引擎飞机潜来我国，当晚秘密空投在四川北部地区；后被我军民发觉，逮捕归案，所携带的美制电台、武器、弹药、活动经费及伪造之各种证件均被缴获。
    重庆市人民法院依法判处罪情极为严重的特务间谍陈涤死刑；对于罪情亦属严重，但在审讯中尚能真诚表示悔过的罪犯刘昌富，从轻判处徒刑十五年。　（本报四川记者站）
