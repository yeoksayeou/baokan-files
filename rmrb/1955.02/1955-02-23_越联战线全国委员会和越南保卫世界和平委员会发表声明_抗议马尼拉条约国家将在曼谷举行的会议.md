Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, February 21st: The Standing Committees of the Vietnam National United Front National Committee and the Vietnam Committee for the Defense of World Peace held a joint meeting in Hanoi on the 17th, with representatives from all walks of life in Vietnam participating. The meeting issued a statement strongly protesting the upcoming meeting of the Manila Treaty nations in Bangkok.

The statement pointed out that the Bangkok meeting convened by the American imperialists is to realize aggressive conspiracies and achieve the purpose of war provocations, which is completely contrary to the wishes and interests of the people of Southeast Asian countries.

The statement said: "We express our firm protest against the convening of this meeting and declare that any resolutions related to Vietnam and the people of North or South Vietnam that may be passed at the Bangkok meeting will be considered invalid. We are convinced that any resolution that this meeting may make will be worthless for Indochina and the entire Southeast Asia."

The statement said that since the establishment of the aggressive Manila Treaty Organization, the Vietnamese people have been opposing this group. They will, like the people of Southeast Asian countries, continue to firmly oppose this group. The statement expressed deep conviction: "The forces of peace in Southeast Asia and the world will surely shatter all the conspiracies and activities of the American imperialists' war provocations."

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 22nd: The Indonesian "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 21st, denouncing the Manila Treaty nations meeting to be held in Bangkok on the 23rd.

The commentary said that the United States is attempting to consolidate its occupation of Taiwan through the Southeast Asia Treaty. The United States is desperately trying to hold on to Taiwan, treating it as an American colony and turning it into a base for launching new wars against the Soviet Union and China. The Bangkok meeting is to prepare for further American actions. The commentary pointed out that no force can stop the People's Republic of China from exercising its sovereignty and liberating its own territory, Taiwan. The commentary pointed out that the Bangkok meeting also aims to undermine the Asian-African Conference. The Bangkok meeting aims at war, while the Asian-African Conference aims at world peace. The former attempts to expand military treaties, while the latter advocates expanding peace zones.

The commentary also denounced the American conspiracy to pave the way for interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs through the Bangkok meeting.

    越联战线全国委员会和越南保卫世界和平委员会发表声明
    抗议马尼拉条约国家将在曼谷举行的会议
    【新华社二十二日讯】据越南通讯社河内二十一日讯：越南国民联合战线全国委员会和越南保卫世界和平委员会常务委员会十七日在河内举行联席会议，参加的有越南各阶层人民的代表。会议发表了一项声明，强烈抗议马尼拉条约国家即将在曼谷举行的会议。
    声明指出，美帝国主义者召集的曼谷会议，是为了实现侵略阴谋和达到战争挑衅的目的，这种目的是同东南亚各国人民的愿望和利益完全抵触的。
    声明说：“我们对这次会议的召开表示坚决的抗议，并且宣布：曼谷会议可能通过的任何有关越南和北越或南越人民的决议都将被认为是无效的。我们确信，这个会议可能作出的任何决议对于印度支那和整个东南亚都将是没有价值的。”
    声明说，从侵略性的马尼拉条约集团成立以来，越南人民就一直在反对这个集团。他们将同东南亚各国人民一样，继续坚决地反对这个集团。声明表示深信：“东南亚以及全世界的和平力量一定能粉碎美帝国主义者的一切战争挑衅的阴谋和活动。”
      【新华社雅加达二十二日电】印度尼西亚“人民日报”二十一日发表评论，斥责将在二十三日在曼谷举行的马尼拉条约国家会议。
    评论说，美国正在企图通过东南亚条约巩固它对台湾的占领。美国正在拼命地企图抓住台湾不放，把它当作美国的殖民地，并且把它变成一个对苏联和中国发动新的战争的基地。曼谷会议就是要为美国的进一步行动作准备。评论指出，没有任何力量能够阻挡中华人民共和国行使它的主权，解放它自己的领土台湾。评论指出，曼谷会议目的还在于破坏亚非会议。曼谷会议的目的在于战争，而亚非会议的目的在于世界和平。前者企图扩大军事条约，后者主张扩大和平地区。
    评论还指责美国企图通过曼谷会议为干涉印度尼西亚内政铺平道路的阴谋。
