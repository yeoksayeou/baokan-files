Xinhua News Agency, February 27th—The Ministry of Supervision of the People's Republic of China recently issued instructions to supervisory organs at all levels, requiring them to actively cooperate with relevant units to organize forces to supervise and inspect the issuance of new currency and the recovery and destruction of old currency, in order to ensure the smooth progress of this work. The instructions emphasized focusing on the following aspects for supervision and inspection:

    I. Starting from March, the supervisory offices of the banking system should focus on inspecting whether bank staff members carefully follow the instructions from higher authorities during the redemption process, with regards to the counting, recounting, punching holes, cutting corners, and sealing of the old currency; whether they are careful to prevent the exchange of counterfeit money; whether they strictly adhere to the rule of only recovering old currency and not paying it out; and whether the accounting procedures are clear, and whether there are any instances of embezzlement or fraud.

    II. Cooperate with relevant departments in supervising and inspecting the work of banks in destroying old currency. Inspect whether the location and measures for destruction are safe; re-examine or randomly check whether the amounts destroyed match the records, and strictly supervise the thorough destruction to prevent embezzlement, theft, or fire caused by carelessness during destruction.

    III. Supervise and inspect whether state-owned commercial enterprises and cooperatives have sufficient and timely supplies of goods during the issuance of new currency and the recovery of old currency; whether they have violated the regulations of higher authorities regarding not raising prices while issuing new currency and the rule of only recovering old currency and not paying it out.

    IV. Supervise and inspect whether staff members of state organs have violated the State Council's order regarding the issuance of new Renminbi and the recovery of existing Renminbi.

The instructions stated that if any failure to implement government orders or instances of embezzlement or theft are discovered during the inspection, they should be promptly studied and dealt with, or opinions should be submitted to the local Party and government leading organs for handling.

    监察部指示各级监察机关
    监督检查新币发行和旧币收回销毁工作
    【新华社二十七日讯】中华人民共和国监察部最近向各级监察机关发出指示，要求监察机关积极配合有关单位组织力量，对新币的发行和旧币的收回、销毁工作进行监督和检查，以保证这一工作的顺利进行。指示中提出要着重从以下几方面进行监督检查：
    一、银行系统监察室应从三月份开始着重检查银行工作人员在收兑工作中，是否认真按照上级规定对收兑的旧币进行清点、复点以及打洞、切角、封包等措施；是否注意防止兑入假币；对旧币是否严格遵守只收回不付出的规定；账务手续是否清楚，有无贪污、舞弊等情形。
    二、配合有关部门监督检查银行销毁旧币工作。检查销毁地点的设置和措施是否安全；复查或抽查销毁的数额是否相符，并严格监督其彻底销毁，以免发生贪污、盗窃或因销毁时不慎而引起火灾等事故。
    三、监督检查国营商业、合作社在发行新币和收回旧币过程的物资供应是否充实和及时；有无违反上级关于不得在发行新币的同时调高物价和对旧币只收不付的规定。
    四、监督检查国家机关工作人员有无违反国务院关于发行新的人民币和收回现行的人民币的命令的行为。
    指示说，在检查中发现有未贯彻政府命令或贪污、盗窃等事件时，应及时研究处理或提出意见报请当地党和政府领导机关处理。
