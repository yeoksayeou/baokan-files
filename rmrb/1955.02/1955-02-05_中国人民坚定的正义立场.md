The peace-loving people of the whole world are closely watching the tense situation in the Far East caused by the United States' policy of aggression and war provocation against China. They are fervently demanding that this aggressive behavior of the United States be stopped. This just call for peace is rising in all parts of the world.

The United Nations Security Council, in its discussion of the Taiwan situation on January 31, passed the inclusion of two proposals on the agenda. One was the Soviet proposal on "the aggressive acts of the United States against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan and other islands regions of China." The other was the New Zealand proposal on the so-called "hostile actions in certain island regions along the coast of mainland China." These two suggestions form a sharp contrast. The Soviet proposal is truly aimed at eliminating the tension and threat of war created by the United States in the Taiwan region, while the New Zealand proposal is clearly an interference in China's internal affairs and a violation of the United Nations Charter. However, under the manipulation of the United States, the Security Council actually invited our country to attend the discussion of New Zealand's proposal under the circumstances that the representative of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique was illegally occupying China's seat in the Security Council.

On February 3, Premier and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai replied to UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld, stating solemnly: "The Government of the People's Republic of China cannot accept the invitation of the United Nations Security Council to send representatives to participate in the discussion of New Zealand's proposal." At the same time, he stated: "Only in order to discuss the Soviet proposal and under the condition that the representative of the People's Republic of China attends to represent China after the Chiang Kai-shek clique's representative is expelled from the Security Council, can the People's Republic of China agree to send representatives to participate in the Security Council's discussion."

The Chinese people exercising their sovereignty and liberating their territory is entirely China's internal affair and has never caused, nor will cause, international tensions. It is only because the United States occupies Taiwan and interferes in China's internal affairs that the situation in the Taiwan region has become tense. Recently, after the United States flagrantly signed the US-Chiang war treaty, it has sent more naval and air forces to Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait region to carry out war provocations against the Chinese people and prepare to expand its aggression against China. The President of the United States also submitted a message to Congress on January 24, openly threatening to wage war against the People's Republic of China. The US aggressor group has also clamored for the use of atomic weapons against China from all sides. These actions by the United States cannot but further exacerbate the tension of the situation. Therefore, anyone who truly desires to ease the tense situation should support the Soviet proposal and stop the US aggression in order to eliminate the root cause of the tense situation.

The New Zealand proposal does not mention the United States' aggression and interference in China, but insists that the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, and other islands is a "threat to international peace and security." This is a clear distortion of right and wrong, interference in China's internal affairs, covering up the US aggression against China, and direct violation of the United Nations Charter. This proposal is a product of the "ceasefire" trick planned by the United States and its followers. Of course, this proposal is resolutely opposed by the Chinese people. The Government of the People's Republic of China certainly cannot participate in the discussion of this proposal. In the absence of a representative of the People's Republic of China representing China in the Security Council's discussion, all decisions made by the Security Council regarding Chinese issues are illegal and invalid.

The People's Republic of China, with a population of 600 million, is still deprived of its legitimate status and rights in the United Nations, while the representatives of the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, who have been spurned by the Chinese people, illegally occupy China's seat in the United Nations, which makes it impossible for representatives of the People's Republic of China to attend United Nations discussions on issues related to China. However, even at this recent Security Council meeting, the Soviet representative's proposal to expel the representative of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique was once again vetoed. This is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people. The United Nations Security Council must expel the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique spurned by the Chinese people, and the representatives of the Government of the People's Republic of China must attend and represent China in the discussion of the Soviet proposal. Only in this way can the Security Council's discussion help ease the tense situation in the Taiwan region. This is the firm and just stand of the Chinese people. This fully conforms to the common demands of the peace-loving people of the world and those who truly desire to ease the tense situation in the Far East.

The Chinese people, in line with their consistent stand of striving to ease the tense situation in the Far East, will support all genuine efforts in the international community to ease and eliminate the tense situation created by the United States in the Taiwan region and other regions of the Far East.

### 中国人民坚定的正义立场

    中国人民坚定的正义立场
    全世界爱好和平的人民密切注视着美国对中国的侵略政策和战争挑衅所造成的远东紧张局势。他们热烈要求制止美国的这种侵略行为。这一正义的和平呼声，正在世界各地高涨起来。
    联合国安全理事会在一月三十一日讨论台湾局势问题，通过将两个建议列入议程。一个是苏联提出的“关于美国在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为”问题的提案。另外一个是新西兰提出的所谓“在中国大陆沿海某些岛屿地区的敌对行动”的建议。这两个建议形成了鲜明的对照。苏联的提案真正是为了消除美国在台湾地区所造成的紧张局势和战争威胁，而新西兰的建议则明显地是干涉中国内政、违反联合国宪章的。但是安全理事会在美国操纵之下，竟邀请我国在蒋介石卖国集团代表在安理会窃据代表中国的地位的情况下，出席参加讨论新西兰的建议。
    二月三日，我国周恩来总理兼外长复电联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，严正表示：“中华人民共和国政府不能应联合国安全理事会的邀请，派遣代表出席参加对新西兰的建议的讨论。”并同时表示：“只有在为了讨论苏联的提案并在安全理事会驱逐蒋介石集团的代表而由中华人民共和国的代表出席代表中国的情况下，中华人民共和国才能同意派遣代表参加安全理事会的讨论。”
    中国人民行使自己的主权，解放自己的领土，完全是中国的内政，从来没有、也不会造成国际紧张局势。只是由于美国霸占台湾，干涉中国内政，才使台湾地区的局势紧张起来。最近，美国在悍然签订了美蒋战争条约以后，更增派大批海空军到台湾和台湾海峡地区，对中国人民进行战争挑衅，准备扩大对中国的侵略。美国总统又在一月二十四日向国会提出咨文，公然威胁要对中华人民共和国进行战争。美国侵略集团还从各方面对中国叫嚣使用原子武器。美国的这些行动就不能不更加加剧了局势的紧张。因此，只要是真正愿望和缓紧张局势的人都应该支持苏联的提案，制止美国的侵略，以消除局势紧张的根源。
    新西兰的建议只字不提美国对中国的侵略和干涉，却硬把中国人民解放台湾、澎湖和其他岛屿的正义斗争说成是“威胁国际和平和安全”。这就是明显地颠倒是非，干涉中国的内政，掩盖美国对中国的侵略，直接违反联合国宪章。这个建议就是美国及其追随者所策划的“停火”的诡计的产物。这个建议当然是中国人民所坚决反对的。中华人民共和国政府当然不能参加讨论这个建议。在没有中华人民共和国的代表在安理会代表中国参加讨论的情况下，安理会对有关中国问题的决定都是非法的，无效的。
    拥有六万万人口的中华人民共和国仍被剥夺了在联合国的合法地位和权利，而被中国人民唾弃了的蒋介石卖国集团的残余分子的代表却在联合国中窃据代表中国的地位，这就使中华人民共和国的代表无法出席联合国讨论有关中国的问题。但是，就在最近这次安全理事会上，苏联代表关于驱逐蒋介石卖国集团代表的提案竟又一次遭到否决。这是中国人民绝对不能容许的。联合国安全理事会必须驱逐中国人民所唾弃的蒋介石卖国集团代表，而由中华人民共和国政府的代表出席，代表中国参加关于苏联提案的讨论。只有这样，安全理事会的讨论才能有助于台湾地区的紧张局势的和缓。这是中国人民坚定的正义立场。这是完全符合全世界爱好和平的人民和真正愿望和缓远东紧张局势的人们的共同要求的。
    中国人民将本着一贯为和缓远东紧张局势而努力的立场，支持国际上一切为和缓并消除美国在台湾地区和远东其他地区所造成的紧张局势的真正努力。
