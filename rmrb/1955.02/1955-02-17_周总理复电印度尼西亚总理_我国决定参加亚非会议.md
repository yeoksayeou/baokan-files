    Premier Zhou Replies to Indonesian Prime Minister
    China Decides to Participate in the Asian-African Conference

    [Xinhua News Agency, February 17th] Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of the People's Republic of China sent a telegram to Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo, accepting the invitation to participate in the Asian-African Conference. The text of the telegram is as follows:

    To His Excellency Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo of the Republic of Indonesia,
    Mr. Prime Minister:

    I have received your letter of invitation dated January 15, 1955, representing the five initiating countries of Burma, Ceylon, India, Pakistan, and Indonesia, inviting the People's Republic of China to participate in the Asian-African Conference, as well as the attached memorandum regarding the purpose and nature of the Asian-African Conference.

    The Asian-African Conference is the first conference in history convened to promote goodwill and cooperation among Asian and African countries, to explore and promote their mutual and common interests, and to establish and enhance friendly and neighborly relations. The convening of this conference reflects the tremendous changes that have taken place in this region of the world in recent times, and also reflects the increasingly strong desire of Asian and African countries to take their destiny into their own hands and to cooperate amicably with other countries in the world on an equal footing. The convening of this conference also provides a good opportunity for Asian and African countries with different social systems to coexist peacefully and contribute to the promotion of world peace and cooperation, under the principle that the government form and way of life of any one country shall not be interfered with by another.

    The Government of the People's Republic of China agrees with the purposes of the Asian-African Conference and is honored to have the opportunity to work with other Asian and African countries towards these goals. The Government of the People's Republic of China has decided to accept the invitation and send a delegation to the Asian-African Conference to be held in Bandung, your country, on April 18, 1955.

    I will notify Your Excellency of the number of members of the delegation of the Government of the People's Republic of China as soon as possible.

    Your Excellency, please allow me to take this opportunity to extend my highest respect to you, the initiator, founder, and host of the Asian-African Conference.

        Zhou Enlai
        Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
        February 10, 1955, in Beijing

    Telegram from Indonesian Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo to the Premier of the People's Republic of China:
    Mr. Prime Minister:

    At the meeting of the Prime Ministers of Burma, Ceylon, India, Pakistan, and Indonesia held in Bogor on December 28 and 29, 1954, it was unanimously agreed to convene the Asian-African Conference in April 1955.

    The conference will be jointly initiated by the governments of the above-mentioned five countries, and the Government of Indonesia is honored to represent them as the host. The initiating governments have decided that the conference will be held in Bandung for about a week, from April 18 to 24, 1955.

    Regarding the purposes and other details of the Asian-African Conference, please refer to the memorandum that I am honored to attach for your consideration. I would particularly like to draw Your Excellency's attention to our general attitude towards the conference as set forth in paragraphs eight and nine of the memorandum. The conference itself will determine its own rules of procedure and agenda.

    I believe that the information contained in the memorandum will give Your Excellency a sufficiently clear idea of the purpose and nature of the Asian-African Conference. Therefore, I am honored to represent the initiators of the conference in inviting Your Excellency's government to send representatives to the conference in accordance with paragraph five of the memorandum.

    The initiators of the conference would be deeply grateful if Your Excellency could notify me of your government's decision to participate in the conference as soon as possible, preferably before mid-February.

    If, as I sincerely hope, Your Excellency's government decides to participate, I would also appreciate it if you could inform me of the number of members of your government's delegation so that I can make the necessary arrangements for their accommodation, etc.

    The Joint Secretariat established in Jakarta will be happy to provide further details relating to the conference, as well as other information required by participants.

    Please allow me to take this opportunity to extend my highest respect to Your Excellency.

        Dr. Ali Sastroamidjojo
        Prime Minister of Indonesia
        January 15, 1955, in Jakarta

    Attachment:

    Memorandum

    (1) At the meeting held in Bogor on December 28 and 29, 1954, the Prime Ministers of Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan unanimously agreed that the Asian-African Conference should be jointly convened by them. They have reached agreement on all issues relating to the Asian-African Conference.

    (2) The purposes of the Asian-African Conference are:

    A. To promote goodwill and cooperation among Asian and African countries, to explore and promote their mutual and common interests, and to establish and enhance friendly and neighborly relations.

    B. To discuss the social, economic, and cultural problems and relations of the participating countries.

    C. To discuss issues of particular interest to the peoples of Asia and Africa, such as issues relating to national sovereignty and issues of racism and colonialism.

    D. To discuss the position of Asian and African nations and their peoples in the world today, and the contributions they can make to the promotion of global peace and cooperation.

    (3) The Asian-African Conference is scheduled to be held in Indonesia in April 1955. The Indonesian government has agreed to make the necessary arrangements for the conference on behalf of the initiating countries. A joint secretariat representing the initiating countries has been established in Indonesia.

    (4) The Prime Ministers agreed that the conference should have a broad and geographic basis, and that all Asian and African countries with independent governments should be invited. Based on this basic principle, with slight variations and modifications, they decided to invite the following countries:

    Afghanistan, Cambodia, Central African Federation, China, Egypt, Abyssinia, Gold Coast, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Jordan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Nepal, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Thailand, Turkey, North Vietnam, South Vietnam, Yemen.

    It is hoped that the above 25 countries, as well as the five initiating countries—Burma, Ceylon, India, Indonesia, and Pakistan—will participate in the conference.

    (5) The representatives attending the conference will be at the ministerial level. It is hoped that each invited country will be represented by the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs or the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and will send other representatives that the governments of each country may wish to include in its delegation.

    (6) Due to limitations in accommodation conditions and the large number of countries expected to participate, it is necessary to face the need to limit delegations to a minimum number. The Joint Secretariat will subsequently issue further notices regarding this aspect of the conference.

    (7) The conference will decide its own rules of procedure and agenda. The general scope of the agenda has been stated in the section on the purposes of the conference.

    (8) The Prime Ministers wish to point out that the acceptance of an invitation by any country does not involve or even imply any change in its views on the status of any other country. It merely means that the invited country generally agrees with the purposes of the conference. They also firmly bear in mind the principle that the government form and way of life of any one country should not be interfered with by another. The opinions expressed at the conference by one or more participating countries are not binding on any other country, nor should they be considered as being accepted by any other country, unless the latter so wishes. The fundamental purpose of the conference is to enable the countries concerned to better understand each other's views. The Prime Ministers hope that this clarification will enable all invited countries to accept the invitation extended to them.

    (9) The Prime Ministers wish to state that their action in convening the Asian-African Conference does not imply any exclusive wishes on the part of the member states of the conference. They also do not wish the countries participating in the conference to organize themselves into a regional bloc.

    亚非会议是历史上第一次为了促进亚非各国间的亲善和合作、为了探讨和促进它们相互间的和共同的利益和为了建立和增进友好和睦邻关系而召开的会议。这个会议的召开反映了最近时期以来在世界的这个地区所发生的巨大变化，也反映了亚非各国要把自己的命运掌握在自己的手里、同时以平等的地位同世界上其他国家友好合作的日益坚强的愿望。这个会议的召开也提供了一个良好的机会，使得具有不同社会制度的亚非各国，在任何一国的政府形式和生活方式不受另外一国干涉的原则下，和平共处并为促进世界和平和合作作出贡献。
    中华人民共和国政府同意亚非会议的目的，而且对于能够有机会同其他亚非国家一起为这些目的而努力，也感到荣幸。中华人民共和国政府决定应邀派遣代表团出席一九五五年四月十八日在贵国万隆举行的亚非会议。
    至于中华人民共和国政府代表团的人数，我将尽早通知阁下。

  印度尼西亚共和国阿里·沙斯特
    罗阿米佐约总理的来电：中华人民共和国总理阁下总理先生：
    在缅甸、锡兰、印度、巴基斯坦和印度尼西亚的总理们于一九五四年十二月二十八日及二十九日在茂物举行的会议上，一致同意在一九五五年四月间召开亚非会议。
    该会议将由上述五国政府联合发起，而由印度尼西亚政府荣幸代表他们充当主人。发起的政府已经决定该会议在万隆举行，为时约一星期，即自一九五五年四月十八日至二十四日。
    至于亚非会议的目的和其他详情，请阁下参阅我所荣幸地附上供你考虑的备忘录。我特别愿意提请阁下注意在该备忘录第八、九段中所提出的我们对该会议的一般态度。该会议本身将决定它自己的议事程序和议程。
    我相信备忘录所包括的情况将使阁下对亚非会议的目的和性质有一足够清楚的概念，因此，我荣幸地代表会议的发起人根据备忘录的第五段邀请阁下的政府派代表出席该会议。
    如蒙阁下能尽早地、最好是在二月中以前将有关阁下的政府参加该会议的决定通知我，则会议的发起人将深为感激。
    假如像我所深深希望的那样，阁下的政府决定参加的话，那么如蒙您同时将组成贵政府代表团的人数通知我，使我能为他们的住宿等作必要的安排，则我表示感激。
    在雅加达成立的联合秘书处将随时提供与会议有关的进一步详情，以及那些为参加会议者所需要的其他情况。
    请允许我借此机会向阁下致以崇高的敬意。
              印度尼西亚总理
              阿里·沙斯特罗阿米佐约博士
              一九五五年一月十五日于雅加达
    附件：
    备忘录
    （一）在一九五四年十二月二十八日及二十九日在茂物举行的会议上，缅甸、锡兰、印度、印度尼西亚和巴基斯坦的总理一致同意亚非会议应由他们联合发起召开。他们已就亚非会议所引起的一切问题达成协议。
    （二）亚非会议的目的是：
    甲、促进亚非各国间的亲善和合作，探讨和促进它们相互间的和共同的利益，建立和增进友好和睦邻关系。
    乙、讨论参加会议各国的社会、经济与文化问题和关系。
    丙、讨论对亚非国家人民具有特别利害关系的问题，例如有关民族主权的问题和种族主义及殖民主义的问题。
    丁、讨论亚非国家和它们的人民今天在世界上的地位，以及它们对于促进世界和平和合作所能作出的贡献。
    （三）亚非会议定于一九五五年四月在印度尼西亚举行。印度尼西亚政府已经同意代表发起的国家为这个会议进行必要的安排。代表发起国家的联合秘书处已设在印度尼西亚。
    （四）总理们商定会议应有广泛的和地理上的基础，亚洲和非洲所有具有独立政府的国家都应当被邀请。根据这个基本原则稍作变动和修改，他们决定邀请下列国家：
    阿富汗、柬埔寨、中非联邦、中国、埃及、阿比西尼亚、黄金海岸、伊朗、伊拉克、日本、约旦、老挝、黎巴嫩、利比里亚、利比亚、尼泊尔、菲律宾、沙特阿拉伯、苏丹、叙利亚、泰国、土耳其、北越、南越、也门。
    希望上述二十五个国家以及五个发起国——缅甸、锡兰、印度、印度尼西亚和巴基斯坦——将参加会议。
    （五）参加会议的代表将是部长级，希望各被邀请国将由总理和外交部长或外交部长任代表，并派遣各国政府可能希望包括在它的代表团内的其他代表。
    （六）由于住宿条件的限制以及预计参加的国家数目众多，必须面临将代表团限制到最低人数的必要性，对于会议这方面的情况，联合秘书处将随后发出进一步的通知。
    （七）会议将决定它自己的议事程序和议程，议程的一般范围已在会议的目的一节中加以陈述。
    （八）总理们愿意指出，任何一个国家接受邀请，绝不牵涉到或甚至意味着它对于任何其他国家的地位所抱的看法有任何改变。它仅仅意味着，这个被邀请国是一般地同意会议的目的的。他们也牢牢记住这项原则，任何一国的政府形式和生活方式绝不应受到另外一国的干涉。一个或一个以上的参加国在会议上所表示的意见对任何其他国家都无约束力，也不应被认为是被任何其他国家所接受，除非后者希望这样。会议的基本目的是，使有关的国家能够更好地了解彼此的见解。总理们希望，这种澄清将使所有被邀请的国家都能接受对它们的邀请。
    （九）总理们愿意声明，他们想要召开亚非会议这一行动，并不是在会议的会员国方面抱着任何排他的愿望。他们也不希望参加会议的国家使自己组织成一个区域集团。
