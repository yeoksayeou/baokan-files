Learning and Implementing the Resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party's Seventh Central Committee

    The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held a plenary session on February 3rd and 4th to study the issue of deeply learning and implementing the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party's Seventh Central Committee. On February 7th, it convened a meeting of Party member cadres at the deputy department level and above throughout the city to convey the resolutions. The Party Committee of the Jiang'an Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, the Party Group of the Municipal Bureau of Culture, and the Party Group of the Construction Bureau have successively begun inspections.
    In the past, the Wuhan Party organization's study of the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party's Seventh Central Committee had yielded gains. However, because it did not grasp the important issues in each stage, deeply carry out criticism and self-criticism, and educate cadres through various typical events, some leading cadres' individualistic arrogance and complacency have not been overcome. They exaggerated their achievements and personal roles in their work. There are also some Party members who do not maintain Party unity, do not care about the people's suffering, and adopt a rude and brutal attitude towards the masses. The Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China requires Party organizations throughout the city to overcome individualistic arrogance, complacency, and bureaucratic work styles in this study and strengthen Party unity. The Municipal Committee also proposed that leading organs at the municipal and district levels, as well as Party committees and Party groups of large factories, should combine their study with inspections and summaries of last year's work, check their thinking, and check their leadership. In the study, responsible cadres of each unit must personally participate, and cadres above the section chief level can also be involved. Members of the Standing Committee of the Municipal Committee should go deep into key units to eliminate ideological obstacles in a timely manner and support criticism and self-criticism.

Strengthening Party Work in Schools

    The Organization Department of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a symposium on organizational work in schools throughout the province. At the meeting, opinions were exchanged on how to strengthen Party work in schools. The meeting reflected that some Party member leading cadres in some schools do not pay attention to political work or cannot well implement the Party's policy towards intellectuals; there is a relatively common sense of arrogance and complacency among Party member teachers, they do not humbly learn from the advanced Soviet teaching experience, are not united with each other, or are not at ease with educational work; there is also a relatively common tendency among Party member students not to pay attention to political study. All of these have affected the Party's connection with the masses. The symposium proposed that in the future, it is necessary to improve and strictly enforce the political life and organizational life of Party organizations in schools, use the general line and the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Party's Seventh Central Committee to constantly criticize various erroneous ideological tendencies within the Party, and continuously improve the communist consciousness of Party members through political classes, Party classes, and symposiums. At the same time, Party organizations in schools should, according to the characteristics of the school and focusing on teaching, do a good job in the cultivation, education, and investigation of activists, and develop new Party members in a planned way, in order to strengthen the Party's organization in the school and enhance the Party's role as a fighting fortress in the school.

Outstanding Members of Ethnic Minorities in Xikang Join the Party

    Outstanding members of various ethnic minorities in Xikang Province have successively joined the Communist Party of China. In the Xichang Special District, where ethnic groups are mixed, there are now more than 100 Party members from ethnic minorities such as Yi, Hui, Tibetan, Miao, Mongolian, and Lisu, and 15 percent of the ethnic minority cadres in the organs have joined the Communist Party of China. From July to the end of December last year, the Kangding Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, in addition to the original ethnic minority Party members, also newly recruited more than 100 Tibetan Party members, and dozens of Yi and Hui Party members. In recent years, some outstanding ethnic minority cadres have also been successively admitted to the Communist Party in various counties of the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture and various directly affiliated organs at the provincial level.
    These newly admitted Party members have played a significant role in various tasks. For example, Sha Zhi, a Hui Party member in Xichang County, led Han and Hui farmers to organize agricultural production cooperatives, which was one of the earliest established in Xikang Province.

A Large Number of Outstanding Lake Management Laborers Join the Party

    During the Dongting Lake restoration project, local Party organizations admitted 1,008 lake management laborers and cadres into the glorious Communist Party of China. Many of these new Party members are model figures in the lake management project. For example, Zhang Xuejin and Qiu Dunji, leaders of the advanced group of the Sixth Brigade of the Second General Team of Hanshou, created advanced working methods in the lake management project and improved work efficiency.
    The admission of a large number of new Party members has further stimulated the enthusiasm of the broad masses of lake management laborers. Many laborers and cadres have expressed their intention to strive to join the Party with practical actions to do a good job in lake management. Currently, 2,600 laborers in the West Dongting Lake and South Dongting Lake construction areas have applied to join the Party, and local Party organizations are studying and reviewing them, and paying attention to strengthening their communist education.

Sichuan Develops New Party Members in Conjunction with the Establishment of Cooperatives

    Party organizations in various parts of Sichuan Province have developed more than 23,000 Party members in the work of establishing the first batch of agricultural production cooperatives. Most of these newly developed Party members are key members in the agricultural mutual aid and cooperation movement. For example, among the 565 newly developed Party members in Huayang, Fuling, and Shehong counties, 301 are the chairmen and vice-chairmen and committee members of agricultural cooperatives, and 179 are heads of mutual aid teams. Recently, the Organization Department of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized the experience in Party building: 1. While training leading cadres for cooperative establishment, it is possible to train work cadres who perform Party building tasks, and to make this group of cadres realize that cooperative establishment and the development of Party work can be combined. 2. When training key members for cooperative establishment, Party development targets should be absorbed to participate, and the eight issues of the standards of Communist Party members can be explained in the training class to conduct communist education for them. 3. Rely on the branch, mobilize all Party members, and in the process of cooperative establishment, educate and train the targets of Party development, absorb them to participate in the preparatory work for cooperative establishment, and in conjunction with each link of cooperative establishment, specifically explain the Party's policies and the standards of Party members, and encourage them to strive to join the Party with practical actions to participate in cooperative establishment. After such repeated investigation, education, and the test of practical work, it can not only ensure that outstanding members who meet the conditions for joining the Party are absorbed into the Party, but also powerfully promote the development and consolidation of agricultural cooperatives.

    各地党组织的活动
    学习和贯彻党的四中全会决议
    中共武汉市委员会在二月三、四两日举行全体会议，研究了关于深入学习和贯彻党的七届四中全会决议问题；七日又召开了全市副处长以上党员干部大会进行了传达。江岸机车车辆修理工厂党委、市府文化局和建设局党组等单位已先后开始检查。
    过去，武汉市党的组织学习党的四中全会决议是有收获的，但由于没有抓住各个环节中的重要问题，深入开展批评和自我批评，通过各种典型事件教育干部，因此有一些领导干部的个人主义骄傲自满情绪还未克服，他们夸大工作中的成绩和个人作用。也还有一部分党员不维护党内团结，不关心人民的疾苦，对群众采取蛮横粗暴态度。中共武汉市委要求全市党组织在这次学习中，克服个人主义骄傲自满情绪和官僚主义作风，加强党的团结。市委并提出：市级、区级领导机关和大工厂党委、党组在学习中要结合检查和总结去年工作，检查思想，检查领导。在学习中各单位负责干部必须亲自动手，同时可以吸收科长以上干部参加。市委常委委员要深入重点单位，及时消除思想障碍，支持批评和自我批评。

    加强学校中的党的工作
    中共辽宁省委组织部在最近召开了全省学校组织工作座谈会。会上对如何加强学校中党的工作交换了意见。会议反映：目前有些学校中的党员领导干部不重视政治工作或不能很好贯彻党对知识分子的政策；党员教员中较普遍地存在着骄傲自满情绪，不虚心学习苏联先进教学经验，互相间不团结，或不安心教育工作；党员学生中亦较普遍地存在着不重视政治学习的倾向。所有这些，都影响了党和群众的联系。座谈会上提出了：今后必须健全和严格学校中党组织的政治生活和组织生活，以总路线和党的七届四中全会决议精神，经常地批判党内的各种错误的思想倾向，并通过政治课、党课、座谈会等形式来不断提高党员的共产主义觉悟。同时，学校中的党组织应根据学校特点，围绕教学，做好对积极分子的培养、教育、考察工作，有计划地发展新党员；以壮大学校党的组织，增强党在学校中的战斗堡垒作用。

    西康少数民族的优秀分子入党
    西康省各少数民族的优秀分子陆续加入中国共产党。在民族杂居的西昌专区，现在已有彝、回、藏、苗、蒙、傈僳等少数民族党员一百多人，机关少数民族干部中百分之十五都已加入了中国共产党。中共康定地委从去年七月到十二月底为止，除了原有的少数民族党员外，又新吸收了一百多名藏族党员，和几十名彝族和回族党员。在凉山彝族自治区各县和省级各直属机关，近年来也陆续接收了一些优秀的少数民族干部参加了共产党。
    这些新入党的党员在各种工作中起了很大作用。如西昌县回族党员沙智，领导汉、回族农民组织了农业生产合作社，这是西康省建立最早的一个社。                       （吴　畏）
    大批优秀的治湖民工入党
    在修复洞庭湖工程中，当地的党组织吸收了一千零八个治湖民工和干部光荣地加入了中国共产党。这批新党员很多是治湖工程中的模范人物，如汉寿二总队六大队先进小组组长张学进、邱敦基曾在治湖工程中创造了先进工作法，提高了工作效率。
    大批新党员入党，进一步激发广大治湖民工的积极性。很多民工和干部表示要用做好治湖工作的实际行动来争取入党。现在西洞庭湖和南洞庭湖工区民工申请入党的已有二千六百名，当地党的组织正在研究审查，并注意对他们加强共产主义教育。

    四川各地结合建社发展新党员
    四川省各地党组织在建立第一批农业生产合作社工作中，发展了两万三千多名党员，这些新发展的党员多为农业互助合作运动中的骨干分子。如华阳、涪陵、射洪三县新发展的五百六十五个党员中，有三百零一人是农业社的正副社长和社务委员，有一百七十九人是互助组长。最近中共四川省委组织部，总结了建党经验：一、在训练建社的领导干部的同时，可以训练执行建党任务的工作干部，并且要使这批干部认识建社和发展党的工作是可以结合进行的。二、训练建社的骨干分子时，要吸收党的发展对象参加，并可在训练班上讲解共产党员标准的八项问题，对他们进行共产主义教育。三、依靠支部，发动全体党员，在建社过程中，教育和培养发展党的对象，吸收他们参加建社的筹备工作，并结合建社的每一环节，具体讲解党的政策，党员标准，鼓励他们以参加建社的实际行动争取入党。经过这样反复考察教育和实际工作的考验，不但能够保证把具备入党条件的优秀分子吸收到党内来，同时有力地推动了农业社的发展和巩固。（管）
