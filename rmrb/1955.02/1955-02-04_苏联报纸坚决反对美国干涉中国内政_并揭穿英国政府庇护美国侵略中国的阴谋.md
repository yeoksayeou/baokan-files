Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 3rd: The "Izvestia" published an article by Rogov: "Stop the American acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China."

Rogov said that since the US Congress authorized President Eisenhower to independently decide to use US armed forces to "ensure" the "security" of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, the war hysteria stirred up by the United States' ruling bloc has been intensifying day by day.

The argument of the US ruling bloc that it wants to "defend America" in the Taiwan Strait is obviously absurd, because the question of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands can only be a matter of China's internal affairs.

Long before the US President submitted his message to Congress, the US newspapers and the most aggressive elements in the United States spread the fallacy that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands do not belong to China. This statement was supported by British Foreign Secretary Eden, who recently claimed in the House of Commons that Taiwan "has never been part of China in this century." To say this is tantamount to deliberately distorting history and supporting the past Japanese imperialism and the current US imperialism in their illegal occupation of China's Taiwan.

The US ruling bloc is making a futile attempt to "prove" that the indisputable issue that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands belong to China seems to be yet to be resolved. The intention of this attempt is the US aggressors' conspiracy to artificially transform this issue, which is clearly China's internal affair, into an international issue. From this point, and only from this point, can one see through the hypocrisy of the American "mediation," which pretends to hope to stop military actions in the Taiwan Strait and wants the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs in violation of the UN Charter.

The author went on to write that under this American conspiracy, Britain's position seems particularly bad. Regardless of its diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, Britain participates in all provocations carried out by the United States against China's territorial integrity and the safety of the Chinese people. It is quite obvious that if Britain did not support the United States' predatory ambitions in the Far East, the United States would not dare to take such open acts of aggression. This shows how much responsibility Britain should bear for the aggravation of the tension in the Far East caused by the actions of the US ruling bloc. New Zealand's attempt to involve the United Nations in Washington's aggressive conspiracy is in line with the US attempt to turn the Taiwan issue, which falls within the scope of China's internal affairs, into an international issue.

The author then pointed out that the Soviet Union fully supports the just position of the People's Republic of China: resolutely defend its legitimate right to liberate the inseparable part of Chinese territory from the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique and oppose any interference in its internal affairs.

The author finally talked about the Soviet Union's proposal in the United Nations Security Council regarding the issue of the US aggression against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan region. He wrote that the proposal put forward by the Soviet Union in the Security Council shows the Soviet Union's consistent concern for defending peace and ensuring the security of all nations. At the same time, this proposal also embodies the Soviet Union's enthusiastic support for the just and legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China. This proposal is in line with the interests of the people of all countries who are committed to stopping the new war planned by the US aggressive forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, February 3rd: I. Alexandrov published an article in "Pravda" about the conspiracy of those who shield the US aggression against the People's Republic of China. The article wrote that it is clear that if Britain did not support the US aggression against the People's Republic of China, the US ruling bloc might not dare to take such actions.

The broad masses of the world can see very clearly that the British government's "peace-making" rhetoric is absolutely not for establishing peace in the Far East, because peace in the Far East can only be established after the roots of international tension have been eradicated, that is, after the US aggressive bloc's rude and illegal interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China has been stopped.

Alexandrov pointed out that the United States is increasingly isolated morally and politically in the world. Alexandrov continued to write: What the London ruling bloc is worried about is this situation. Since they have no way to whitewash the policy implemented by the United States in the Far East, they are trying to at least reduce the criticism of this aggressive policy by world public opinion.

According to a report by the United Press International, this task was undertaken by the British Prime Minister. At the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference that opened in London, Churchill insisted that on the Taiwan issue, his policy is: not to blame anyone at present. Such an attitude is of course only beneficial to those who are afraid of not being able to cover up their guilt. The publication of such remarks in itself shows the world who is the real aggressor in the Far East. The British Prime Minister emphasized in his speech: The British Empire should not harm or tarnish the face of "its old ally - the United States."

Alexandrov then pointed out that, according to United Press International news, this paragraph defending the US aggressive policy catered to the tastes of some people in the United States. The US news agency vigorously publicized the words and claims of the British Prime Minister, but the British news agencies remained silent on the matter. British newspapers also remained silent. This is understandable: this passage from the British Prime Minister will never be supported by all sectors of society in the British Commonwealth countries.

Alexandrov finally wrote that the British public is very clear: where the threat to peace comes from, who is the culprit of international tension in the Far East, and who is implementing the policy of supporting and helping the aggressive forces that are undermining the security of the people of all countries there.

### 苏联报纸坚决反对美国干涉中国内政  并揭穿英国政府庇护美国侵略中国的阴谋

    苏联报纸坚决反对美国干涉中国内政
    并揭穿英国政府庇护美国侵略中国的阴谋
    【新华社三日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科三日讯：“消息报”发表罗果夫的一篇文章：“制止美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为”。
    罗果夫说，自从美国国会授权艾森豪威尔总统自行决定使用美国武装力量来“保障”台湾和澎湖的“安全”之后，美国所掀起的战争歇斯底里在一天天地加剧。
    美国统治集团声称要在台湾海峡“保卫美国”，这种论调显然是荒谬的，因为台湾和澎湖的问题只能是中国的内政问题。
    还在美国总统向国会提出咨文的很久以前，美国报纸和美国最富侵略性的人就散布这样一种谬论，说台湾和澎湖好像不属于中国。这种说法得到英国外交大臣艾登的支持，艾登不久前曾在下院声称，台湾“在本世纪内从来就不是中国的一部分”。说这种话，就等于存心歪曲历史，等于支持过去日本帝国主义以及现在美帝国主义非法侵占中国的台湾。
    美国统治集团徒劳地企图“证明”，台湾和澎湖属于中国这一不容争辩的问题似乎还有待解决，这种企图的用意是美国侵略者阴谋人为地把这个明明是中国的内政问题变成国际问题。从这一点，而且只有从这一点才能看透美国的虚伪的“斡旋”是怎么一回事，它假装着一副希望停止台湾海峡的军事行动的面孔，要联合国违反联合国宪章去干涉中国的内政。
    作者接着写道，在美国这种阴谋之下，英国的立场显得特别恶劣。英国不顾它和中华人民共和国之间的外交关系，参与美国对中国的领土完整、对中国人民的安全所进行的一切挑衅。十分明显，如果英国不支持美国在远东的掠夺野心，美国是不敢采取这种公开的侵略行动的。这就说明了英国对美国统治集团的行动所引起的远东紧张局势的加剧应负多少责任。新西兰采取的企图把联合国卷入华盛顿的侵略阴谋的步骤是符合美国企图把中国内政范围内的台湾问题变成国际问题的阴谋的。
    作者接着指出，苏联完全支持中华人民共和国的正义立场：坚决捍卫它把中国领土不可分割的部分从蒋介石卖国集团手中解放出来的合法权利，反对对它的内政的任何干涉。
    作者最后谈到苏联在联合国安全理事会提出的关于美国在台湾地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为问题的提案。他写道，苏联在安全理事会提出的提案表明了苏联对保卫和平和保障各国人民的安全的一贯关怀。同时，这个提案还体现了苏联热烈支持中华人民共和国的正义的、合法的权利。这个提案是符合于致力于制止美国侵略势力所策划的新战争的各国人民的利益的。
    【新华社三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科三日讯：伊·亚历山德罗夫在“真理报”发表文章，谈到那些庇护美国侵略中华人民共和国的人的阴谋。文章写道，很明显，如果英国不支持美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行为，美国统治集团也许不敢采取这种行动。
    全世界广大的社会人士都看得很清楚，英国政府的“和事”言论绝对不是为了在远东确立和平，因为，只有在铲除了产生国际紧张局势的根源之后，也就是制止了美国侵略集团对中华人民共和国内政进行的粗暴和非法的干涉之后，远东的和平才能够确立。
    亚历山德罗夫指出，美国在道义上和政治上在全世界日益孤立。亚历山德罗夫接着写道：伦敦统治集团担心的就是这种情况。他们既然没有办法替美国在远东实行的政策粉饰，就力图至少压低世界舆论对这种侵略政策的指责。
    据美国合众社报道，这个任务由英国首相承担。在伦敦开幕的英联邦总理会议上，邱吉尔坚持说，在台湾问题上他的政策是：目前不归罪于任何人。这样的态度当然只有利于那些害怕不能掩盖自己的罪责的人。发表这种言论的本身就向全世界说明，究竟谁是远东的真正侵略者。英国首相在发言中特别着重说：英帝国不应当损害或是玷辱“自己老盟友——美国”的面子。
    亚历山德罗夫接着指出，根据合众社消息来看，这一段为美国侵略政策辩护的话迎合了美国某些人的口味。美国通讯社大力宣传英国首相的话和主张，可是英国各通讯社对此事却表示沉默。英国报纸也表示沉默。这是可以理解的：英国首相的这段话决不能得到英联邦各国社会各界的支持。
    亚历山德罗夫最后写道，英国公众非常清楚：对和平的威胁究竟是从哪里来的，谁是远东国际紧张局势的罪人，谁在执行支持和帮助在那里破坏各国人民安全的侵略力量的政策。
