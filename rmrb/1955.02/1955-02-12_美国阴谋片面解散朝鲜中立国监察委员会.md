Xinhua News Agency, February 11th: According to the Associated Press, the United States is plotting to unilaterally dissolve the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission by countries that participated in the Korean War. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Washington on the 9th, the United States and fifteen accomplice countries in the Korean War held a meeting at the U.S. State Department on the 8th to discuss the issue of unilaterally dissolving the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Radford, attended the meeting and made arrangements for the conspiracy to dissolve the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission under the pretext of falsely accusing the Polish and Czechoslovakian members of engaging in so-called "espionage activities."

Following the meeting, it was revealed that the sixteen countries that participated in the Korean War will hold another meeting soon to resolve this issue. They will "probably" move to dissolve the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission. These sources also said that if the Korean and Chinese sides refuse to do so, the countries that participated in the Korean War are prepared to take "unilateral steps." News reports say that such steps will include the South Korean government, supported by the United States, "notifying" the Polish and Czechoslovakian members to leave South Korea. The U.S.'s instigation of this conspiracy is clearly intended to undermine the stability of the Korean armistice in order to aggravate the tense situation in the Far East.

    美国阴谋片面解散朝鲜中立国监察委员会
   【新华社十一日讯】据合众社透露，美国正在策划由参加侵朝战争的国家片面实行解散中立国监察委员会。据合众社华盛顿九日电说，美国和十五个侵朝帮凶国家八日在美国国务院举行会议，讨论片面解散中立国监察委员会的问题。美国参谋长联席会议主席雷德福出席了会议，就以诬蔑波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员进行所谓“间谍活动”为借口来解散中立国监察委员会的阴谋，作了布置。
    会后，据透露，侵朝十六国在不久以后将再举行一次会议来解决这个问题。它们“大概”将动议解散中立国监察委员会。这些人士又说，如果朝中方面拒绝这样做，参加侵朝战争国家准备采取“单方面步骤”。消息说，这种步骤将包括由美国支持的南朝鲜政府“通知”波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员离开南朝鲜。美国策动这一阴谋，显然是为了破坏朝鲜停战的稳定，以加剧远东紧张局势。
