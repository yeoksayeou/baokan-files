    Eternal Glory
    By our reporter Lin Gang
    The delegation from the People's Republic of China to comfort the Soviet troops stationed in the Lushunkou area arrived in Dalian at noon on the 22nd. After a short rest, they went to pay their respects at the Soviet Martyrs Memorial Tower.
    Spring comes early here. The February wind blowing from the sea no longer feels cold, and people no longer turn up their coat collars. The memorial tower stands in the center of the square in front of the city hall, a square named after the glorious Stalin. The sun shines on the white stone memorial tower. With the blue sky as a backdrop, it appears solemn and sacred, symbolizing the eternal glory of the great Soviet army's struggle for peace and justice.
    This tower was built after the Soviet army liberated Lushunkou. The tower is inscribed with a Russian inscription: "Eternal glory to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the struggle for the freedom, independence, and liberation of Northeast China for the Soviet Union." The top of the tower is decorated with a five-pointed star and hammer and sickle, and the tower is also engraved with "1904" and "1945." These two dates remind everyone who comes before it of the history of the past half-century. The great October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in human history. From that day on, the revolutionary forces of the people around the world have grown stronger and stronger, and the international reactionary forces have been on a downward spiral. In 1945, the Soviet army dispatched troops to Northeast China, severely crushing the elite Japanese Kwantung Army, which facilitated the final victory of the Chinese people's War of Resistance Against Japan and ended World War II, which brought human civilization to the brink of destruction. The outstanding sons and daughters of the Russian people won unlimited glory for their motherland and made immortal contributions to world peace. Today, Lushunkou has become a strong peace bastion on the Far Eastern frontier. The historical facts of the past half-century powerfully prove that it is the people, and only the people, who determine the path of historical development.
    The square was silent. On both sides of the memorial tower stood 1,200 honor guards from China and the Soviet Union, dignified and well-ordered. At 3 p.m., the military band played Chopin's "Funeral March." This tragic and solemn piece of music evoked an irrepressible feeling of infinite love and mourning for the Soviet martyrs. Two soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army led the way with wreaths, followed by Peng Dehuai, head of the delegation, Song Qingling, He Long, Guo Moruo, Nie Rongzhen, all members of the delegation, Ambassador Yudin, the commander of the Soviet troops stationed in the Lushunkou area, and the heads of the Dalian city party and government, who walked slowly towards the memorial tower to the sound of mournful music.
    In the war to liberate Northeast China, many Soviet soldiers sacrificed their most precious lives. The battle for Mudanjiang was a fierce one. Soviet hero, Private Vasily Kolesnik, in order to open the way for follow-up troops, used his body to block the gunports of a Japanese pillbox, stopping the enemy's fire on the attacking troops. Standing before these immortal lives, every member of the delegation felt reverence and gratitude. In order to liberate the people of Northeast China enslaved by the Japanese invaders, the blood of the Soviet soldiers flowed together with the blood of the sons and daughters of the Chinese people. All the mothers of the Soviet Union are proud of their outstanding sons, and all the mothers of China are grateful to them.
    This great internationalist spirit of the Soviet army has educated the entire young generation of our country. The heroic achievements of the Chinese people's outstanding sons and daughters in forming the Volunteers to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea have been written on the most beautiful pages of modern human history.
    The dirge continued to play. The delegation laid wreaths at the Soviet Martyrs Memorial Tower. The entire procession took off their hats, stood at attention, and observed a moment of silence. Over the past decade, countless male and female workers, farmers and fishermen, women and old people, professors, scientists, and students have come to the memorial tower to offer wreaths and mourn their loved ones and brothers. The glorious image of the great Soviet martyrs will forever live in the hearts of the Chinese people.
    The delegation then went around to the rear of the square to view another Soviet Martyrs Memorial Tower which is under construction. The new tower is all made of granite, and the bronze statue of a Soviet soldier in front of the tower is as high as a two-story building. When it is completed, it will be even more solemn and magnificent than the current one. The Chinese people will permanently commemorate the immortal feats of the Soviet martyrs who gloriously sacrificed themselves for the liberation of our people and for the happiness of mankind with architecture and sculpture.

    永恒的光荣
    本报记者　林钢
    中华人民共和国慰问驻旅顺口地区苏军代表团二十二日中午到达旅大市，稍事休息以后，就去拜谒苏军烈士纪念塔。
    春天来得早，海上吹来的二月的风已无冷意，人们都不再把大衣领子翻上来了。纪念塔矗立在市府大厦前面广场的中心，这个广场以光辉的斯大林的名字命名。阳光照耀着白石砌成的烈士纪念塔。有蓝天作为背景，显得庄严肃穆，象征着伟大的苏维埃军队为争取和平和正义而斗争的永恒的光荣。
    这个塔是苏军解放旅顺口以后修建的。塔上镌刻着俄文题词：“在争取苏联的自由、独立和解放东北的斗争中牺牲的烈士永垂不朽。”塔巅装饰着五星和镰刀斧头，塔身上还镌刻着“一九○四”和“一九四五”。这两个年代使每一个来到它面前的人想起半个世纪以来的历史。伟大的十月社会主义革命，开辟了人类历史的新纪元。从那一天起，全世界人民革命力量日益壮大，国际反动势力一直在走着倒霉的下坡路。一九四五年，苏军出兵我国东北，痛歼日寇精锐关东军，促成了中国人民抗日战争的最后胜利，结束了使人类文化濒于毁灭的第二次世界大战。俄罗斯人民的优秀子孙为祖国争取了无限的光荣，为世界和平立下了不朽的功勋。今天，旅顺口已经成为远东前哨坚强的和平堡垒。半个世纪的历史事实有力地证明了：是人民，而且只有人民，决定着历史的发展道路。
    广场上寂静无声。纪念塔两侧肃立着中苏两国的一千二百名仪仗队，威武整齐。下午三时，军乐奏起萧邦的“送葬进行曲”。这支悲壮的乐曲，激发着人们难以抑制的对于苏军烈士的无限敬爱和悼念之情。中国人民解放军的两位战士手执花圈为前导，随后，代表团团长彭德怀、副团长宋庆龄、贺龙、郭沫若、聂荣臻、代表团全体代表、尤金大使、苏军驻旅顺口地区部队指挥官，以及旅大市党和政府的负责人等一行，踏着哀乐，缓步走近纪念塔前。
    在解放我国东北的战争中，许多苏联战士牺牲了他们最宝贵的生命。争夺牡丹江是一场激烈的战斗。苏联英雄、上等兵华西里、科列斯尼克为了替后续部队开辟道路，曾经用自己的身体掩住了日寇碉堡的枪眼，阻遏了敌人对进攻部队的射击。站立在这些不朽的生命面前，代表团的每一个人都怀着崇敬和感谢的心情。为了解放日寇奴役下的东北人民，苏维埃战士的鲜血和中国人民子弟兵的鲜血流在一起。全苏联的母亲都为自己优秀的儿子骄傲，全中国的母亲都在感谢他们。
    苏维埃军队这种伟大的国际主义精神，教育了整个我国的年青一代。中国人民的优秀儿女组成志愿军抗美援朝的英雄业绩，已经写在近代人类历史的最美丽的篇页上。
    哀乐继续奏着。代表团在苏军烈士纪念塔前放下了花圈。拜谒的行列全体脱帽，立正，致默哀。十年来，曾经有千千万万的男工和女工、农民和渔民、妇女和老人、教授、科学家和学生，来到纪念塔前献花圈，哀悼自己的亲人和兄弟。伟大的苏军烈士的光辉形象永远活在我国人民的心里。
    代表团随后绕行到广场后方，瞻仰另一座正在新建的苏军烈士纪念塔。新塔全部用花岗石砌成，塔前苏军战士的铜像有二层楼房那么高，全部建成以后，将比现在的更为庄严雄伟，中国人民将以建筑和雕刻来永久纪念为我国人民的解放事业、为人类的幸福而光荣牺牲的苏军烈士的不朽功勋。
