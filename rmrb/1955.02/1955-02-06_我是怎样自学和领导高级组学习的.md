    How I Study on My Own and Lead Advanced Group Learning
    Chen Feng, Secretary of the CPC Nanning Municipal Committee

    Since joining the revolution, although I have read some theoretical books, most of them were read without a plan, without a system, and superficially, without in-depth study and integration. Since studying the documents of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, especially after the Party Central Committee issued the "Instructions on Cadre Theoretical Education in 1953-1954," under the supervision of the higher party committee and with the help of comrades, I began a more systematic theoretical study in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee. After two years of such study, I feel that my thinking, theory, and work have been improved to a certain extent, and I deeply realize the importance of studying theory. For example, after studying Malenkov's report, Stalin's "Economic Problems of Socialism in the USSR," and Chapters 9 and 10 of the "History of the CPSU (B)," I deeply realized the guiding significance of Marxism-Leninism and the advanced experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union for our party to formulate the guidelines and policies for the transition period in our country. I also have a deep understanding of the direction and specific path of our country's transition to socialism. Therefore, the more I learn, the more I feel my own shortcomings, and the more I feel the importance of theory guiding practice, so I gradually established a conscious attitude towards learning.

    However, a conscious attitude towards learning is not established all at once. According to my personal experience over the past two years, it goes through the following three stages: First, the stage of beginning to enter systematic theoretical study. In this stage, there are fewer automatic and conscious components, and most of the study is done to complete the learning tasks stipulated by the higher authorities. For example, taking notes, drafting speech outlines, writing papers, and taking exams are all just regarded as things that must be done to comply with the system. But even so, after a period of time, due to some gains from learning, and a preliminary feeling that learning is helpful to work, the conscious component in learning gradually increases. This enters the second stage, that is, the stage of "combining compulsion and voluntariness." In this stage, on the one hand, it is necessary to abide by the various systems stipulated by the higher authorities, and on the other hand, one also realizes the close relationship between theoretical study and work, so one gradually develops the habit of self-study. After another period of time, one feels even more that learning is of great help to improving one's ideological and theoretical level and improving work, and one truly realizes the importance of learning, thereby embarking on a completely automatic and conscious stage. After experiencing these three stages, I deeply realized that the Party Central Committee's stipulation of systematic theoretical study is completely correct, and the stipulation of a learning system is completely necessary. At this time, my theoretical study changed from unsystematic to systematic, from irregular to regular, from reluctant to conscious, and from cursory reading to serious study. This process is also an arduous process of ideological struggle.

    Based on my experience over the past two years, to do a good job in theoretical study and develop learning habits, one must make efforts in the following three aspects:

    First, ideological importance. This is to fully recognize the great significance of Marxist-Leninist theory for revolutionary practice. In the past, we relied on the guidance of revolutionary theory to achieve great victory in the Chinese revolution. In the future, we need to master the theoretical weapon even more in the cause of building socialism. Without theoretical guidance, it is impossible to build our country into a great socialist country.

    Studying Marxism-Leninism is first and foremost learning the correct viewpoints and methods for analyzing and handling problems. Only in this way can we consciously implement the party's policies and avoid being captured by bourgeois ideology.

    Facts have proven that studying theory is of great help to one's own analysis of problems, improvement of leadership methods, and improvement of work efficiency. For example, after studying Chapter 9 of the "History of the CPSU (B)," due to recognizing the importance of commercial work in the period of national economic construction and that the market is the link between industry and agriculture, we grasped commercial work and market management more tightly in November and December 1953. Doing so played a certain role in rectifying the state-owned commercial system, vigorously promoting the sale of industrial products to the countryside to support the state's grain purchase work, carrying out the movement to increase production and practice economy in the commercial sector to accumulate funds, and supporting national industrialization. After studying the party's general line in the transition period and Chapter 10 of the "History of the CPSU (B)," we not only recognized that heavy industry is the material basis of socialism, but also further recognized the relationship between the development of heavy industry and Marx's theory of expanded reproduction, and also recognized that urban work must be centered on the development of production, and the development of production must be centered on industrial production. In this way, it is necessary to do a good job in local industry and strengthen the socialist transformation of handicrafts and capitalist industry and commerce to support national industrialization. After a year of doing so, our urban work has advanced a step on the existing basis.

    We must also remember that learning is the duty of a party member. Our party has always attached importance to theoretical study. The party constitution stipulates that party members must strive to improve their level of awareness and understand Marxism-Leninism. Those who do not work hard to learn cannot become good communists. Although everyone's job position and education level are different, mastering revolutionary theory is the duty of every party member. As a communist party member, I always pay attention to fulfilling this solemn duty stipulated by the party, and use it to spur myself on in learning. Therefore, I feel that to be able to attach importance to learning ideologically, in addition to recognizing the importance of theory, one must always remember that learning is the duty of a party member.

    Second, properly arrange one's own work and study time. Generally speaking, comrades who participate in advanced group learning are more responsible comrades and are busier at work. If they do not pay attention to improving leadership methods and strictly arranging time, their work will fall into busy bureaucratism, and they will not be able to squeeze out time for learning. Therefore, whether the time is arranged properly is one of the keys to whether one can persist in learning. The so-called arranging time here is to adhere to the principle of studying on time, working on time, and resting on time. Personally speaking, I can basically arrange my time according to this principle. My personal life is relatively regular. In addition to studying on my own or collectively every Wednesday and Saturday afternoon, I spend half an hour reading the party newspaper of the day every morning, and about one hour studying theory or business. During office hours, I attend meetings, handle work, or go deep into key areas to understand the situation. Generally, I do not convene meetings in the evening, and use this time to read newspapers, magazines, and party documents. I rest around 10:30 in the evening. The weekly study time is more than eight hours. Sometimes the study plan is disrupted by the central work, so one must be good at squeezing out time to make up for the lessons. In the beginning, it felt like there were many difficulties in doing so, but as long as one can persevere, arrange time properly, and after a period of time, one will gradually develop a habit.

    Third, read carefully. Repeated and careful reading, and hard study are the central issues of self-study. We must oppose the learning attitude of cursory reading, rushing to complete tasks, and being too ambitious, and cultivate the spirit of continuous study and gradual deepening. To read carefully, according to my personal experience, the following four steps must be consistently implemented when studying each important document: The first is to read roughly, that is, to browse the main documents once or twice to understand the main outline and general meaning of the documents. Then there is careful reading, repeated thinking, marking the important places in the document with red lines, circling the key sentences, writing marginal notes on the main issues of each paragraph and section of the document and my own understanding of the issue, marking the unclear or incomprehensible places with question marks or writing them in the notebook, and then rereading, further studying, finding the central issue, and then compiling the issues found to write an outline of the issues. The third step is to find the necessary reference materials purposefully according to the outline of the issues, carefully select the reference materials, combine the main documents with the reference materials, and conduct in-depth research. Finally, combine the understanding when reading the main documents with the materials provided by the reference documents, digest, sort out, and write learning notes. These are the steps I personally go through for self-study.

    These are my preliminary experiences in persisting in self-study.

    Self-study must be combined with collective learning. As the leader of a study group, in addition to serious self-study, one must also lead the group's study well. According to our central group's recent summary of the study of Chapter 10 of the "History of the CPSU (B)" and some past experiences, to do a good job in the theoretical study of the advanced group, the following three links must be grasped:

    First, we must adhere to the learning system. Adhering to the learning system is the guarantee of doing a good job in theoretical study. Only by strictly implementing and consciously abiding by the learning system can self-study and discussion be carried out smoothly and can the learning plan be completed on schedule. The key to adhering to the learning system is to make comrades ideologically recognize the importance of learning and resolutely overcome the attitude of not learning because of busy work, not learning because of meetings, and not learning because of bad mood. Only after ideological importance is attached can everyone properly arrange their own work, appropriately allocate time, and solve the contradiction between work and study in terms of time.

    Strengthening inspection and supervision is also an important method of adhering to the learning system. There are many ways to inspect and supervise. According to our experience, the following methods are effective: One is to assign a central speaker to lecture to the intermediate group. This can encourage everyone to read carefully, collect materials, analyze and summarize, write notes, speech outlines or lectures. The second is to conduct spot checks on notes, criticize those who do not take notes, and those who write incomplete, incomplete, or fail to grasp the center of the issue, everyone puts forward supplementary opinions. The third is that everyone must write experience or special papers. This is also a kind of supervision of learning. The fourth is to stipulate that group members report their learning situation to their respective party branches or party groups on a regular basis, accept the supervision of the party, and at the same time, the group leader reports the performance of the group members in learning to the branch or group to which the group members belong, and seeks the supervision of the party group or branch over them.

    Second, we must advocate serious reading. Hard study is the fundamental method of studying Marxism-Leninism. For advanced group comrades, advocating serious reading has its important significance. To read seriously, first of all, we must clarify the purpose, requirements, and key points of studying each document, so that reading has a direction, and we can distinguish between priorities. When studying each issue or each section, the group leader should make full consideration in advance, and write the purpose, requirements, and key points of the study into written form and distribute them to each group before the group discussion. Secondly, we must especially emphasize careful reading of the main documents, such as the important works designated by the Central Committee. When advocating serious reading, we should criticize the learning method of being too ambitious, putting down the main documents and not reading them, but looking at too many reference documents, so that the main spirit and essence of the documents are not deeply understood. At the same time, we must combine serious personal self-study with promoting mutual assistance and encouragement among comrades, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism. Finally, in order to have ample time for self-study, we must also call on everyone to make good use of their spare time for self-study. Some comrades in our group have done this, and can often maintain eight to ten hours of study per week, which is a good phenomenon.

    Third, we must constantly improve the quality of discussion meetings. In the study of Chapter 10 of the "History of the CPSU (B)," we held a total of seven discussion meetings, basically achieving the purpose of designating reading documents in advance and having a central speaker during the discussion. However, the shortcoming is that the central speaker's speech time is too long, generally around one and a half hours, and the content stays on the general theoretical narration, without analysis and criticism, and cannot put forward difficult problems that can cause controversy, which hinders the in-depth development of the discussion. Some comrades have a dependence mentality, thinking that they are not the central speaker, so they do not prepare well, and some have a complacent mentality, thinking that others' speeches "are old hat," so they do not listen attentively, which affects the development of the discussion. Recently, after summarizing, we believe that to make the discussion meeting achieve greater gains, the most important key is the preparation work before the discussion meeting. The serious self-study of each group member is the foundation for improving the quality of the discussion meeting. Giving play to the mutual assistance role within the group also creates conditions for improving the quality of the discussion meeting. Self-study, mutual assistance, and discussion are an inseparable process. Furthermore, we should do a good job in the central speech, so that it can be compact in time, grasp the central issue, and stimulate the interest of discussion. At the same time, although we cannot demand too much from the content of the central speech, it is best to have the center, personal opinions, experience, and difficult issues. After the central speech, the group leader should be good at raising questions, inspiring everyone to think together, launching debates, and deepening the discussion. In addition, we must also advocate bold suspicion and bold questioning. In the past, our discussion meetings did not have disputes, or had few disputes, and the speeches during the discussion were not enthusiastic enough. In order to overcome this shortcoming, so that learning and discussion can go deeper, solve problems, and effectively improve the quality of the discussion meeting, we must advocate the learning spirit of bold suspicion and cultivate the learning attitude of obeying the truth.

    我是怎样自学和领导高级组学习的
    中共南宁市委书记　陈枫
    我参加革命以来，虽然阅读了一些理论书籍，但多是没有计划、没有系统、走马看花地阅读，没有做到认真钻研，融会贯通。自从学习苏联共产党第十九次代表大会文件，特别是在党中央发布“关于一九五三——一九五四年干部理论教育的指示”后，才在上级党委的督促和同志们帮助之下，遵照党中央的指示，开始了较有系统的理论学习。两年来经过这样的学习，自己觉得在思想上、理论上和工作上都有了一定程度的提高，深深体会到学习理论的重要。如学习马林科夫报告、斯大林“论苏联社会主义经济问题”以及“联共（布）党史”第九章和第十章后，深刻地体会到马克思列宁主义、苏联建设社会主义的先进经验对于我党制定我国过渡时期的方针、政策的指导意义。对我国向社会主义过渡的方向、具体道路也有了深刻认识。因此，越学越感觉自己的不足，越学越感觉到理论指导实践的重要意义，于是也就逐渐树立了自觉的学习态度。
    但自觉的学习态度不是一下子就树立起来的。根据我个人两年来的体验，是要经过以下三个阶段的：第一，是开始步入系统学习理论的阶段。在这一个阶段里自动自觉的成分较少，多半是为了完成上级规定的学习任务而学习。如做笔记、拟发言提纲、写论文、参加考试等，都只是当作遵守制度不得不做的。但就是这样，经过了一个时期后，由于学习有了些收获，初步感觉到学习对工作有所帮助，学习中的自觉的成分逐渐增长了。这样就进入了第二阶段，亦即“强迫与自愿相结合”的阶段。在这阶段中，一方面必须遵守上级规定的各种制度，一方面自己也体会到理论学习和工作的紧密关系，于是也就逐渐养成了自学的习惯。再经过一个时期后，更感觉到学习对提高自己的思想理论水平和改进工作有很大帮助，切实体会到学习的重要性，从而走上完全自动自觉的阶段。经历了这三个阶段后，我深深地体会到党中央规定有系统地学习理论是完全正确的，规定学习制度是完全必要的。到了这时，我在理论学习上才从不系统到系统，从不正规到正规，从勉强到自觉，从走马看花到认真读书。这段过程，也是一个艰苦的思想斗争过程。
    根据我两年来的体会，要搞好理论学习，养成学习习惯，必须从下列三方面去努力：
    第一，思想重视。这就是要充分认识马克思列宁主义理论对革命实践的伟大意义。过去我们依靠革命理论的指导，使中国革命取得了伟大胜利，今后在建设社会主义的事业中尤需要掌握理论武器。没有理论指导，要把我国建成一个伟大的社会主义国家是不可能的。
    学习马克思列宁主义，首先是学习分析问题、处理问题的正确观点和方法。只有这样，才能清醒地执行党的政策，才不致于为资产阶级思想所俘虏。
    事实证明，学习理论对自己分析问题、改进领导方法和提高工作效率有很大的帮助。比如我们在学习“联共（布）党史”第九章后，由于认识到在国家经济建设时期商业工作的重要性，市场是工农业间的纽带，因而在一九五三年十一月十二月间，对商业工作与市场管理抓得较紧。这样做了，对整顿国营商业系统，对大力推销工业品下乡支持农村的粮食统购工作，对在商业部门中开展增产节约运动积累资金，以及支援国家工业化等都起了一定的作用。学习党在过渡时期的总路线及“联共（布）党史”第十章后，不仅认识了重工业是社会主义的物质基础，更进一步认识了发展重工业和马克思扩大再生产的理论的关系，同时也认识了城市工作必须以发展生产为中心，而发展生产又以工业生产为中心。这样，就必须搞好地方工业和加强对手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造，以支援国家工业化。一年来经过这样做了之后，我们的城市工作在已有的基础上前进了一步。
    我们还要记住，学习是党员的义务。我们的党一向是重视理论学习的，党章规定党员必须努力提高自己的觉悟程度和领会马克思列宁主义。不努力学习的人是不能成为一个好的共产党员的。尽管各人的工作岗位、文化程度有所不同，但掌握革命理论却是每个党员的义务。作为一个共产党员，我时刻注意履行党所规定的这个庄严的义务，在学习中以此来鞭策自己。所以我觉得要能从思想上重视学习，除了认识理论的重要性外，就要时刻记住学习是党员的义务。
    第二，妥善地安排自己工作和学习的时间。一般来说，参加高级组学习的同志是比较负责的同志，工作较繁忙，如果不注意改进领导方法和严格地安排时间，工作就会陷于忙忙碌碌的事务主义，也就无法挤出时间来学习。所以时间安排得妥善与否，是能否坚持学习的关键之一。这里所谓安排时间，就是要坚持按时学习，按时工作，按时休息的原则。以我个人来讲，基本上是能按照这个原则来安排自己的时间的。我个人生活比较有规律，除每星期三、六下午自学或集体学习外，每天早上看当天党报半小时，以一小时左右时间学习理论或业务，办公时间内开会、处理工作或深入重点了解情况。晚上一般不召集会议，用这个时间阅读报刊、杂志及党内文件。晚上十时半左右休息。每周学习时间在八小时以上。有时学习计划为中心工作所打乱，就要善于挤出时间来补课。开始时感到这样做困难很多，但只要能坚持下去，妥善地安排时间，经过一个时期后，也就逐步养成了习惯。
    第三，认真读书。反复精读，刻苦钻研，这是自学的中心问题。必须反对走马看花，赶任务和好高骛远的学习态度，培养不断钻研，逐步深入的精神。要做到认真读书，根据我个人的经验，学习每个重要文件时必须始终贯彻下面四个步骤：首先是粗读，就是说将主要文件浏览一、二次，了解文件的主要轮廓及大意。接着是精读，反复地思考，将文件中重要的地方打上红杠，在带有关键性的句子旁划上红圈，将文件中每段每节的主要问题和自己对这个问题的认识写成眉批，将还不明确或不懂的地方打上问号或写在摘记簿上，然后重读，进一步钻研，找出中心问题，再将所找出的问题汇集起来，写出问题纲要。第三步是根据问题纲要有目的地去寻找必需的参考材料，仔细选择参考材料，将主要文件同参考材料揉合起来，作深入一步的研究。最后，将阅读主要文件时的认识结合参考文件所提供的材料，经过消化，整理出来，写成学习笔记。这就是我个人自学所经历的几个步骤。
    我个人坚持自学的初步体会就是如此。
    自学必须与集体学习相结合，作为一个学习小组长来讲，除了认真自学以外，还要把小组的学习领导好。根据最近我们中心组总结学习“联共（布）党史”第十章及过去的一些经验，要搞好高级组的理论学习，必须抓住下面三个环节：
    第一，必须坚持学习制度。坚持学习制度是搞好理论学习的保证，只有严格执行和自觉地遵守学习制度，自学和讨论才能顺利地进行，才能按期完成学习计划。而坚持学习制度的关键则是使同志们从思想上认识学习的重要性，坚决克服工作忙不学、因开会而不学、情绪不好不学的态度。只有思想重视后，每个人才会妥善地安排自己的工作，恰当地分配时间，解决工作同学习在时间上的矛盾。
    加强检查督促，也是坚持学习制度的重要方法。检查督促的方法有多种多样，按照我们的经验，下列几种是行之有效的：一种是指定中心发言人给中级组讲课。这可以促使大家认真读书，搜集材料，分析归纳，写笔记、发言提纲或讲稿，其次是抽查笔记，对不写笔记的提出批评，写得不完整、不全面或抓不到问题中心的，大家提出补充意见。再就是每人都要写心得或专题论文。这也是对学习的一种监督。再就是规定组员按期向所属党支部或党小组汇报学习情况，接受党的监督，同时组长将组员在学习上的表现汇报给组员所属的支部或小组，求得党小组或支部对他们进行监督。
    第二，必须提倡认真读书。刻苦钻研，是学习马克思列宁主义的根本方法。对高级组同志来说，提倡认真读书更有其重要的意义。要做到认真读书，首先要明确学习各个文件的目的、要求和重点，这样读书才有方向，才能分别轻重缓急。学习每一个问题或每一节时，组长事前要作充分的考虑，在各小组讨论前把学习的目的、要求和要点写成书面的东西分发到各小组中去。其次要特别强调精读主要文件，如中央指定的重要著作。在提倡认真读书时应该批判那种好高骛远，放下主要文件不读而去看过多的参考文件，致使对文件的主要精神实质体会不深的学习方法。同时还要把个人认真自学和发扬同志间的互助互勉、开展批评和自我批评结合起来。最后为了有充裕的时间进行自学，还要号召大家善于利用业余时间进行自学。我们小组中有些同志这样做了，经常能保持每周八至十小时的学习，这是好的现象。
    第三，必须不断提高讨论会的质量。在学习“联共（布）党史”第十章中，我们共举行了七次讨论会，基本上做到了事前指定阅读文件、讨论时有中心发言。但缺点是中心发言时间过长，一般在一点半钟左右，内容则停留在一般理论的叙述上，没有分析批判，提不出足以引起争论的疑难问题，这就妨碍了讨论的深入开展。有的同志则有依赖思想，以为自己不是中心发言人，便不很好地准备，有的则有骄傲自满情绪，以为别人发言“是老一套”，便不用心听，这些都影响了讨论的开展。最近我们经过总结，认为要使讨论会能取得更大的收获，首要关键是讨论会前的准备工作。而每个组员的认真自学，是提高讨论会质量的基础。发挥小组内的互助作用，也为提高讨论会的质量创造了条件。自学、互助、讨论是三位一体不可分割的过程。再就是搞好中心发言，使它能够做到时间紧凑、抓住中心问题，激发讨论的兴趣。同时对中心发言的内容，虽不能要求过高，但最好要有中心、个人的看法、体会及疑难问题。中心发言后，小组长要善于提出问题，启发大家共同思考，展开争论，将讨论深入下去。此外，还要提倡大胆怀疑，大胆提出问题。我们讨论会过去没有争论，或争论不多，讨论时发言不够热烈，为了克服这点缺点，使学习讨论能够深入下去，能够解决问题，切实提高讨论会的质量，就必须提倡大胆怀疑的学习精神和培养服从真理的学习态度。
