After the heavy snow at the beginning of this year, more than two thousand farmers cutting firewood in Baoying County, Jiangsu Province, were trapped in the reed marshes in the heart of Baoying Lake. The snow on the beach blocked the doors of the firewood sheds of the firewood cutters. The sharp north wind pierced the skin, and the temperature suddenly dropped to about fifteen degrees below zero. Many of the trapped people were thinly clothed, and some had run out of food. The beach was wider than the Yangtze River at its closest point to the shore, and the lake water near the shore was frozen, so ships could not navigate. Therefore, the people trapped inside could not get out, and food and cotton clothes from the outside could not be transported in.

Among the trapped people were many Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members. They took the lead in overcoming difficulties, giving everyone warmth and strength to overcome the severe cold and danger. During the days they were trapped, they went around every morning through the knee-deep snow to offer their condolences. They used shovels to dig away the snow blocking the doors of the firewood sheds, and woke up those who were frightened by the difficulties and slept all day. They carried rice bags and sent the only remaining rice to those who had run out of food, and helped the elderly open ice holes to fetch water and cook. Li Rongyu's family in Xinmin Township were all trapped on the beach, and the whole family of five only had one cotton quilt. At that time, he moved to the vicinity of the firewood shed of Communist Party member Yang Buting. Yang Buting called out to him several times every night when he patrolled through the heavy snow: "Old Li, are you cold?" Every morning Yang Buting would call out to him again: "Old Li, get up early and shake yourself up." Afterwards, Li Rongyu told others: "Every time I heard his voice, I could struggle to get up. One night we were shivering from the cold, Yang Buting gently came over and took off the coat he was wearing and put it on us. He was just as cold! Communist Party members are truly people who share weal and woe with us."

After being trapped for a few days, on the morning of January 6th, an ice skating boat approached the beach from the direction of the rising sun. This was sent by the Baoying County Committee of the Communist Party of China. The people on the ice skating boat said: "Don't worry, it's not easy for the boats to travel, and the roads are not easy to walk, the government has sent planes to deliver things to you."

After receiving the news that the farmers cutting firewood on the Baoying Lake beach were trapped, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government immediately sought ways to rescue them; and consulted with an air force unit of the People's Liberation Army to send planes to airdrop emergency supplies. On the afternoon of the 6th, the planes sent by an air force unit of the People's Liberation Army flew over Baoying Lake and dropped bags of dry food and clothing. Everyone on the reed beach came out, some holding red flags and waving to the sky, some clapping hard, and some shouting: "Long live Chairman Mao", "Long live the Communist Party." All those who lacked clothes and food ate the pancakes "sent from the sky", put on thick cotton clothes, and added new cotton quilts in the evening.

After the airdrop, icebreakers rowing over from the lake also transported a lot of rice. The County Head of Baoying County personally presided over the opening of traffic on the lake. He led more than one hundred local boatmen and farmers to form a transportation team, including an ice-breaking team, two boat teams, an ice skating boat team, and a relay transportation station composed of wooden boats from the lake shore to the beach, to rescue the trapped people. There were many icebergs and ice holes on the lake. Jiang Rentong, a boatman of the transportation team, once fell into an ice hole, and his clothes were frozen. People advised him to go ashore to change his clothes and rest, but he said: "The Communist Party cares so much about human life, what does it matter if we suffer a little? It won't be cold if I climb out of the water and push the boat hard."

Many elderly people told reporters that before liberation, in the freezing weather, these reed marshes swallowed up many precious lives. In the past, farmers in this area went to the beach every winter to cut firewood and engage in sideline production. When they encountered heavy snow and freezing weather, they asked the landlords who hired them to go to the beach to supply food, but the landlords said: You poor ghosts deserve to die. Gao Zuofu's mother, a farmer in Yuwan Village, Yangqiao Township, lost her life on the reed beach in 1936. This time Gao Zuofu was trapped on the beach again, but was rescued in time. He held his child and told reporters: "If it weren't for the Communist Party, you wouldn't have seen me."

    共产党救活了两千多农民
    新华社记者　孙振　石煤
    今年年初大雪以后，江苏省宝应县有两千多割柴的农民被困在宝应湖心的芦苇滩上。滩地上的积雪阻塞了割柴农民的柴棚的门户。尖利的北风刺人肌骨，气温骤然降低到零下十五度左右。被困的人中许多人的衣服比较单薄，而且有的人已经断粮了。滩地距离湖岸最近的地方比长江还宽，岸边湖水结冰，船只断航，因此困在里边的人出不来，外边的粮食棉衣也运不进去。
    在被困的人们中有许多共产党员和青年团员。他们带头起来克服困难，给了大家以战胜严寒和危难的温暖和力量。在被困的日子里，每天大早他们就翻着半人深的雪堆到处进行慰问。他们拿着铁锹挖掉阻塞了柴棚门户的积雪，叫起有些为困难吓倒整天睡觉不起的人。他们背着米袋把仅剩的大米送给断粮的人，帮助老年人打开冰窟取水煮饭。新民乡李荣玉一家都困在滩上了，全家五个人只带有一条棉被。当时他就搬到共产党员杨步亭的柴棚附近去了。杨步亭每夜踏着大雪巡视的时候，都要叫他几声：“老李，你冷吧。”每天早晨杨步亭又要叫他一下：“老李，早点起来抖抖精神。”事后李荣玉告诉别人说：“我每次听到他的声音，就能够挣扎着起来了。有一天晚上我们正冷得发抖，杨步亭轻轻地走来，把他身上穿的大衣脱下来给我们盖上了。他自己一样地冷呀！共产党员真正是和我们同甘苦共患难的人。”
      在被困几天后，一月六日的早晨，从太阳升起的方向一只滑冰船靠拢了滩地。这是中共宝应县委会派来的。滑冰船上的人说：“大家放心吧，船不好行，路不好走，政府派飞机给你们送东西了。”
    中共江苏省委员会和江苏省人民政府得到宝应湖滩上割柴农民被困的消息以后，立刻想办法营救；并商请人民解放军某空军部队派飞机前往空投急救物资。六日下午，人民解放军某空军部队派出的飞机就飞到了宝应湖上空，丢下了一包包的干粮和衣物。芦苇滩上所有的人都出来了，有的拿着红旗向空中招展，有的使劲地鼓掌，有的放声高呼：“毛主席万岁”、“共产党万岁”。所有缺少衣服和食物的人都吃到了从“空中送来的”大饼，穿上了厚厚的棉衣，晚上又加了新的棉被。
    飞机空投后，从湖上划过来的破冰船也运到了很多大米。宝应县县长亲自主持打开了湖上的交通。他领导当地一百多船民和农民组成了一个运输队，包括一个打冰队，两个船队、一个冰上滑船队和一个从湖边到滩地用木船组成的接力运输站，来营救被困的人。湖上有许多冰山和冰窟，运输队的船工蒋仁通有一次掉在冰窟里，身上衣服都结了冰。人们劝他到岸上换衣服休息，他说：“共产党这样关心人命，我们吃点苦有什么关系呢？掉在水里爬上来用力推船就不冷了。”
    许多老年人告诉记者，解放以前在冰天雪地的时候，这些芦苇滩上不知吞噬了多少宝贵的生命。过去这一带农民每年冬季都到滩上割柴和进行副业生产。遇到大雪冰冻的天气，他们向雇他们到滩上来的地主要求供应粮食，地主老爷们却说：你们这些穷鬼死了活该。洋桥乡于湾村农民高作富的母亲在一九三六年就是把命断送在芦苇滩上的。这次高作富又困在滩上了，但及时得到了营救。他抱着孩子对记者说：“不是共产党，你已见不到我了。”
