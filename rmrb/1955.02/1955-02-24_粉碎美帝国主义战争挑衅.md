    Smash the U.S. Imperialist War Provocations
    Li Zhuchen, Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Industry and Commerce
    The Chinese people, in support of the World Peace Council Standing Committee's "Appeal to the People of the World," established the Chinese People's Committee Against the Use of Atomic Weapons on the 12th of this month and launched a nationwide signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons. The people of Tianjin are enthusiastically carrying out the signature campaign. Everyone should correctly recognize that it is the people, not weapons, that determine the outcome of war. As Chairman Mao said: "With the great cooperation between our two countries, China and the Soviet Union, all imperialist plans for aggression cannot but be smashed. They will definitely be thoroughly smashed. As long as imperialism launches a war of aggression, we and the people of the world must wipe them off the face of the earth!" By signing the World Peace Council Standing Committee's appeal to the people of the world, we are expressing our firm opposition to the U.S. imperialists' use of atomic weapons to slaughter people and our determination to defend world peace. If U.S. imperialism disregards the opposition of the people of the world and dares to risk launching an atomic war, the result will only hasten its own demise.
    In the years since liberation, with the continuous education of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the political consciousness and patriotism of friends in the industrial and commercial sectors have been further enhanced. I believe that in this signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons, we will all sign our names without exception. However, while signing, we should better recognize that our territory of Taiwan still awaits liberation and our national defense capabilities still need to be strengthened. The insane actions of the American warmongers should be constantly watched, vigilance should be heightened at all times, and full preparations should be made. In order to support the struggle to liberate Taiwan with practical actions and to thoroughly smash the war provocations of U.S. imperialism, private industrialists and businessmen must further enhance their patriotic and law-abiding thinking, actively improve production and management, accept socialist transformation with a sincere and honest attitude, and contribute all their strength to the cause of national construction through a series of practical actions such as completing tax tasks on schedule and enthusiastically purchasing national economic construction bonds.

    粉碎美帝国主义战争挑衅
    天津市工商业联合会主任委员　李烛尘
    中国人民，拥护世界和平理事会常务委员会“告全世界人民书”，在本月十二日成立了中国人民反对使用原子武器签名运动委员会，展开了全国范围的反对使用原子武器签名运动。天津市人民正热烈开展签名运动。大家应该正确地认识，决定战争胜负的，不是武器，而是人民。正如毛主席说的：“在我们中苏两国的伟大合作下，一切帝国主义的侵略计划，没有不能被粉碎的。它们一定要被彻底粉碎。只要帝国主义发动侵略战争，我们和全世界人民就一定要将它们从地球上消灭干净！”我们只要在世界和平理事会常务委员会告全世界人民书上签了名，就是表示了我们坚决反对美帝国主义使用原子武器屠杀人民和表示保卫世界和平的决心。如果美帝国主义不顾全世界人民的反对，竟敢冒险发动原子战争，其结果只会促使它自己遭到灭亡。
    解放几年来，工商界的朋友们在中国共产党和人民政府的不断教育下，政治觉悟和爱国主义思想更有了进一步的提高。我相信，在这次反对使用原子武器签名运动中，我们将会一人不漏的都签上自己的名字。不过在我们签名的同时，应该更好地认识到我国的领土台湾还待解放，我国的国防力量还待充实。美国战争贩子的疯狂行动更应该时刻加以注视，随时提高警惕，做好充分准备。为了以实际行动来支援解放台湾的斗争，为了彻底粉碎美帝国主义的战争挑衅。私营工商业者一定要进一步提高爱国守法的思想，积极改进生产、改善经营管理，以诚恳老实的态度接受社会主义的改造，并且要以如期完成税收任务，踊跃购买国家经济建设公债等一系列的实际行动，为国家建设事业贡献一切力量。
