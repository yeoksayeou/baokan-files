Xinhua News Agency, Prague, February 4th: The Czechoslovak News Agency reported on the 3rd that the President of the Czechoslovak Republic, Zápotocký, issued a proclamation regarding the end of the state of war with Germany.

The proclamation begins by stating: "A state of war has existed between the Czechoslovak Republic and Germany since the time when Hitler's Germany carried out acts of aggression to undermine the security, independence, and territorial integrity of Czechoslovakia. The people of all nationalities in Czechoslovakia demand that the solution to the German question should eliminate the danger of new threats to peace-loving people of all countries, and guarantee the peaceful and democratic development of the German people."

The proclamation points out: "The Potsdam Agreement of the four powers – the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and France – has already indicated the path to achieve this goal. However, the Western countries have made it impossible to reach an agreement on the peaceful reunification of Germany and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and the Paris Agreements are a decisive obstacle on the road to the peaceful reunification of Germany."

The proclamation states that, "In view of the comprehensive cooperation between the Czechoslovak Republic and the German Democratic Republic, which is developing, mutual understanding and friendship are growing, and in view of the fact that there are no conflicting and unresolved issues between the two countries, and in order to promote peaceful cooperation between the people of all nationalities in Czechoslovakia and the whole of Germany, and to establish good neighborly relations, making them a permanent foundation for the peaceful coexistence of the people of all nationalities in Czechoslovakia and the entire German people, I, according to the decision of the Czechoslovak government, declare that the state of war between the Czechoslovak Republic and Germany has ended. Peaceful relations between the two countries are in effect."

The proclamation adds: "Ending the state of war with Germany does not change Germany's international obligations, nor does it affect the rights and obligations conferred upon the Czechoslovak Republic by the existing international agreements of the four powers regarding Germany or other international resolutions regarding Germany in which the Czechoslovak Republic participates."

    捷克斯洛伐克总统宣布结束对德战争状态
    【新华社布拉格四日电】据捷克斯洛伐克通讯社三日报道，捷克斯洛伐克共和国总统萨波托斯基发表了关于结束对德战争状态的公告。
    公告首先说：从希特勒德国进行侵略行为来破坏捷克斯洛伐克的安全、独立和领土完整的时候起，捷克斯洛伐克共和国和德国之间便存在战争状态。捷克斯洛伐克各族人民要求在解决德国问题时要杜绝使爱好和平的各国人民遭遇新的威胁的危险，并且保证德国人民的和平的和民主的发展。
    公告指出：苏、英、美、法四国波茨坦协定已经指出了达到这一目标的道路。但是西方国家使和平统一德国和缔结对德和约的协议一直不能达成，巴黎协定是和平统一德国的道路上的一个决定性的障碍。
    公告说，鉴于捷克斯洛伐克共和国和德意志民主共和国之间的全面合作正在发展，相互谅解和友谊正在增进，更鉴于两国之间并无互相冲突的和没有解决的问题，并且为了捷克斯洛伐克各族人民同整个德国和平合作，并且建立睦邻关系，使之成为捷克斯洛伐克各族人民同全体德国人民和平共处的永久基础起见，我根据捷克斯洛伐克政府的决定宣布：捷克斯洛伐克共和国和德国之间的战争状态已经结束。两国之间的和平关系发生效力。
    公告又说：结束对德国战争状态并不改变德国的国际义务，也不影响四国关于德国的有效的国际协议或捷克斯洛伐克共和国参加的其他关于德国的国际决议所赋予捷克斯洛伐克共和国的权利和义务。
