    Taiwan's Prices Soar, Currency Plummets
    [Xinhua News Agency, February 24th] Under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, prices in Taiwan have recently risen sharply.
    According to reports, the average price index in Taiwan in mid-February has risen by more than 25% compared to the same period last year. Among them, the price of gauze has risen by 80%, electricity bills by 36%, peanut oil by 20%, and the prices of other items such as meat, vegetables, rice, and flour have generally increased. Compared with Taiwan's prices in December last year, prices have risen by 10% in just over two months and are still rising. A February 19th Agence France-Presse report stated that a bundle of cotton yarn priced at 515 pseudo-Taiwan dollars a week ago is now being offered at 821 yuan. Cloth prices have risen by more than 60% in one week.
    The exchange rate of the pseudo-Taiwan dollar issued by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique has also plummeted. Although the "official price" stipulated by the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique is 15.65 pseudo-Taiwan dollars for one US dollar, the exchange rate in the "open market" has fallen to 36 pseudo-Taiwan dollars for one US dollar. The black market exchange rate has even reached more than 40 pseudo-Taiwan dollars for one US dollar. According to foreign news agencies, the black market price of the US dollar is still rising, and there is "no hope of stopping this upward trend immediately."
    The soaring prices and the drop in the value of the pseudo-Taiwan dollar, as well as the resulting proliferation of speculation, have severely hit Taiwan's private industrial and commercial enterprises. Recently, more than a hundred textile factories in Taiwan have been forced to shut down. In the Tainan and Changhua areas alone, fifty or sixty cloth factories have completely ceased operations; more than one hundred and fifty cloth factories in central and southern Taiwan have already stopped or are about to stop production.

### 台湾物价飞涨币值狂跌

    台湾物价飞涨币值狂跌
    【新华社二十四日讯】蒋介石卖国集团统治下的台湾，最近物价急剧飞涨。
    据消息说，二月中旬台湾的物价平均指数比去年同时期上涨了百分之二十五以上。其中，纱布价格上涨了百分之八十，电费上涨百分之三十六，花生油上涨百分之二十，其他如肉类、蔬菜、米、面等价格，都普遍上涨。如以去年十二月台湾物价与目前物价相比，在两个多月时间内上涨了百分之十。目前还在不断上涨中。法新社十九日消息说，在一星期前伪台币五百一十五元一捆的棉纱，现在喊价已达八百二十一元。布价在一星期内上涨了百分之六十以上。
    蒋介石卖国集团发行的伪台币的外汇牌价也猛烈下跌。尽管蒋介石卖国集团规定的“官价”是十五元六角五分伪台币换一美元，但“公开市场”的比价已下跌为三十六元伪台币换一美元。黑市比价甚至曾达到四十余元伪台币换一美元。据外国通讯社报道，目前美元黑市价格还在不断上升，还“看不到立刻使这种上升势头停止的希望”。
    物价的狂涨和伪台币币值的跌落，以及随之而起的投机业的泛滥，使台湾民营工商业受到了沉重打击。最近，台湾有为数达百家以上的纺织厂被迫停工。只台南和彰化一带，就有五六十家布厂完全停工；台湾中部和南部已停工或快要停工的布厂在一百五十家以上。
