    The American aggressive bloc is preparing a bloody plan to launch an atomic war, which has aroused infinite anger and condemnation from kind-hearted men and women around the world. When the more than six million citizens of Shanghai heard the news that the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council had launched a signature campaign to demand the destruction of atomic weapons stored in various countries and the immediate cessation of the manufacture of atomic weapons, they immediately expressed their firm support and warm welcome. There is no doubt that the broad masses of the people of Shanghai, together with the thousands upon thousands of peace-loving people around the world, will write their names and their determination on the Appeal to the People of the World from the Enlarged Meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council. Prohibiting the use of atomic weapons to safeguard world peace is entirely in line with the fundamental interests of the people of the world, and it will surely be supported by more and more kind people around the world. The power of peace is invincible, and it will surely shatter the American aggressive bloc's atomic blackmail and war provocations.
    Since the science of atomic energy was discovered, human history has entered a new and great era. The success of the Soviet Union's first atomic energy industrial power station in the summer of 1954 is a historically significant sign. Recently, in order to promote international cooperation in the peaceful uses of atomic energy, the Soviet government has expressed its willingness to make public its accumulated scientific and technological experience in this regard, and has also decided to provide scientific, technological, and industrial assistance to our country and other people's democratic countries in promoting research on the peaceful uses of atomic energy. We warmly support the Soviet government's policy of using atomic energy for peaceful purposes to benefit mankind.
    Everyone clearly sees that there are two completely different lines on the question of how to utilize atomic energy. The Soviet Union and all peace-loving people want to use this great discovery of human wisdom to benefit mankind; while the American aggressive bloc wants to use atomic energy to carry out destructive war. If we want to make the achievements of human wisdom serve peace and progress, we must resolutely prohibit atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons, and oppose atomic war clamor and provocations. The people of Shanghai resolutely condemn the American aggressive bloc that attempts to launch an atomic war.
    Recently, the American aggressors are stepping up provocations along our country's coast, and are arrogantly issuing shameless threats of atomic war to the Chinese people. They vainly attempt to use atomic war to scare the great Chinese people. They have forgotten that today's world is no longer the world before the Second World War, and today's China is no longer the China of the past Qing Dynasty and the reactionary rule of Chiang Kai-shek. Human history has undergone tremendous changes, and the forces of peace have become unprecedentedly strong. Today, atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons are no longer the exclusive possession of the United States. The era when imperialists ran amok and did whatever they wanted is gone forever. The will of the 600 million Chinese people to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, and the coastal islands is firm and unshakable. Liberating Taiwan is our country's internal affair and brooks no foreign interference. Any threats and intimidation are useless.
    We want to liberate Taiwan in order to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and also to safeguard peace in the Far East and the world. This is entirely just, and therefore it has won the sympathy and support of all justice-upholding and peace-loving people around the world, and has received the strong support of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. In his speech to the Supreme Soviet, Soviet Premier Bulganin pointed out: "The People's Republic of China has won the sympathy of the Soviet people and all progressive mankind because it is fighting for a just cause, for its own honor and independence. The Chinese people can count on the assistance of their faithful friend, the great Soviet people, in this noble cause." We express our infinite and sincere gratitude for the lofty friendship and support of the Soviet government and people.
    The relationship between our two great countries, China and the Soviet Union, is a new type of socialist relationship. For five years, our brotherly friendship and cooperation have become more consolidated and developed. The strength of the great Sino-Soviet alliance is invincible, and it is a powerful bulwark for defending world peace. The policies of China and the Soviet Union to consolidate and maintain peace are supported by all kind people around the world. Because defending peace and opposing aggression is the common aspiration and will of all mankind. On this day of celebrating the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance ,we would like to once again warn the American aggressors: if they are unwilling to accept the lessons of the past failures of aggressors and are unwilling to assess the strength of the people, and truly want to launch a new war of aggression, then what will be destroyed is not the world's humanity, but the American imperialists themselves.

    必须制止美国准备原子战争的罪恶活动
    上海市工商业联合会主任委员　盛丕华
    美国侵略集团正在准备发动原子战争的血腥计划，引起了全世界善良男女无限的愤怒和谴责。上海六百多万市民听到了世界和平理事会常务委员会为要求销毁各国储存的原子武器并立即停止制造原子武器而发起征集签名运动的消息，立即表示坚决的拥护和热烈的欢迎。毫无疑义，广大的上海人民将和全世界千千万万爱好和平的人民一起，把自己的名字和自己的决心写在世界和平理事会常务委员会扩大会议告全世界人民书上。禁止使用原子武器维护世界和平是完全符合全世界人民的根本利益的，它必将得到全世界越来越多的善良人士的拥护和支持。和平的力量是无敌的，它一定可以粉碎美国侵略集团的原子讹诈和战争挑衅。
    自从原子能的科学被发现以后，人类的历史进入了一个新的伟大时代。一九五四年夏天，苏联第一座原子能工业电力站的成功，就是一个具有历史意义的标志。最近，苏联政府为了促进原子能和平用途方面的国际合作，表示准备把自己所积累的有关的科学技术经验公开出来，同时又决定在促进原子能和平用途的研究方面给予我国和其他人民民主国家以科学、技术和工业上的帮助。我们热烈支持苏联政府把原子能用于和平事业为人类造福的政策。
    每个人都很清楚的看到，在怎样利用原子能的问题上存在着两条完全不同的路线。苏联和一切爱好和平的人民要把人类智慧的这一伟大发现拿来为人类谋福利；而美国侵略集团却要把原子能拿来进行毁灭性的战争，我们要使人类智慧的成果为和平和进步服务，就必须坚决禁止原子武器和氢武器，反对原子战争的叫嚣和挑衅。上海人民坚决谴责妄图发动原子战争的美国侵略集团。
    最近，美国侵略者正在我国沿海加紧挑衅，狂妄地对中国人民发出原子战争的无耻威胁。他们妄想用原子战争来吓唬伟大的中国人民。他们忘记了今天的世界已不是第二次世界大战以前的世界了，今天的中国也不是过去满清王朝和蒋介石反动统治时代的中国了，人类的历史已经起了巨大的变化，和平的力量已经空前地强大，今天原子武器和氢武器早已不是美国所独占的东西，帝国主义者横行霸道为所欲为的时代已经一去不复返了。六万万中国人民解放台湾、澎湖和沿海岛屿的意志是坚决不移的。解放台湾是我国的内政，不容外国干涉，任何威胁和恫吓都是无用的。
    我们要解放台湾，是为了要维护国家主权和领土的完整，也是维护远东和世界的和平。这完全是正义的，因此已经得到全世界主张正义和爱好和平人民的同情和支持，得到苏联和人民民主国家的坚强声援。苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁在最高苏维埃会议上的演说中指出：“中华人民共和国之所以获得苏联人民和整个进步人类的同情，是因为它在为正义事业，为自己的荣誉和独立而进行斗争。中国人民可以指望他们这一崇高事业得到自己的忠实朋友——伟大的苏联人民的援助。”我们对于苏联政府和人民的崇高的友谊和支持，表示无限衷诚的感谢。
    我们中苏两个伟大国家之间的关系是新型的社会主义的关系。五年以来，我们兄弟般的友谊和合作是更加巩固和发展了。伟大的中苏同盟的力量是无敌的，它是保卫世界和平的强大堡垒。中苏两国巩固和维护和平的政策，得到全世界一切善良人民的支持。因为保卫和平反对侵略是全世界人类的共同愿望和意志。在庆祝中苏友好同盟互助条约签订五周年的今天，我们愿意再一次警告美国侵略者：如果它们不愿接受历史上侵略者失败的教训和不愿估计到人民的力量，真要发动一次新的侵略战争的话，那末毁灭的不是世界人类，而是美国帝国主义者自己。
