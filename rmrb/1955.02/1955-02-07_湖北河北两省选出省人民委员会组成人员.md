Hubei Province's First People's Congress held its second session in Wuhan City from January 28th to February 5th.

Liu Zihou, representing the Hubei Provincial People's Government, delivered a government work report at the meeting. The report outlined the achievements of Hubei Province's various endeavors over the past five years and examined shortcomings in the work. The report pointed out that in 1955, the state's construction in the Wuhan-Daye area would enter a stage of large-scale construction and preparation.

At the meeting, Nie Guoqing, a delegate to the National People's Congress, conveyed the spirit of the First Session of the First National People's Congress.

At the meeting, all the delegates sent a telegram to the people and cadres in the flood-affected areas to express their condolences.

The First People's Congress of Hebei Province held its second session in Baoding City from February 1st to 5th.

At the meeting, Lin Tie, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial People's Government, delivered a report on the summary of government work in 1954 and a report on the government work tasks for 1955. The report stated that the general task of Hebei Province in 1955 is to further develop industrial and agricultural production, ensure the completion and over-fulfillment of various planned targets, with the focus of the province's work being the development of agricultural production. Specific requirements: total grain output should increase by 16.5% compared to last year's actual output; cotton production should increase by 14% compared to last year; peanut production should increase by 27.5% compared to last year. The report pointed out that in order to achieve the above requirements, the current focus should be on consolidating and rectifying the existing 100,000 agricultural production cooperatives; secondly, efforts should be made to build water conservancy projects, prevent floods and droughts, and carry out a technological reform movement focused on the adoption of new agricultural implements. The report emphasized that preventing water disasters is the key to ensuring increased agricultural production in Hebei Province.
