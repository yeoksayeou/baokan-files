    Before and After the Grain Sale of the Lushi County "May Third" Agricultural Production Cooperative
    Yao Fang

    During the state's unified purchase of grain in the summer of 1954, some members of the "May Third" Agricultural Production Cooperative in Xialiu Village, Lushi County, Henan Province, had ideological resistance. Some female cooperative members "shed tears" when they saw their husbands carrying whole bags of grain out. Some complained, saying: "Joining the agricultural production cooperative is fine in other aspects, but selling surplus grain is too restrictive. You can't be careless at all, and it's not as comfortable as being a single household!"

    When the unified purchase and sale work began after the autumn harvest, the CCP township branch held a joint meeting of party members and Youth League members to understand the ideological situation of the cooperative members. They felt the need to further raise the political consciousness of the cooperative members. At this time, it happened that Hou Shuli, the township branch secretary and cooperative director, returned from visiting the Soviet Economic and Cultural Construction Achievements Exhibition in Beijing. He used everything he had seen to give the cooperative members a vivid education on the socialist future. Then, after the first session of the township People's Congress, the representatives widely publicized the importance of supporting the liberation of Taiwan, supporting the people in disaster areas, and supporting industrial construction to the people of the township. The cooperative members said one after another: "We must respond to the call with practical actions and set an example for individual farmers." However, when it came to "practical actions," many people hesitated – the cooperative members' thinking had not really been straightened out.

    One snowy night, the branch held another joint meeting of party members and Youth League members. At this meeting, everyone studied a report published in the People's Daily on November 19: "Reporting to the Motherland." This report said: Communist Party member Zhang Zifang, for the sake of the Tibetan people and the construction of the motherland's border areas, was not afraid of hunger or cold. Even when he was crushed by a tree and was about to bleed his last drop, he still kept Chairman Mao in mind, kept the dear Party in mind, and kept in mind the opening of the road to Lhasa. Everyone was so moved that they couldn't speak. After a short silence, Communist Party member Qiao Youpeng raised his head and said: "Compared with Comrade Zhang Zifang, we are really ashamed! What is he working so hard for? We stay in our hometown, neither freezing nor starving, and when we do a little work, we always want to plan for ourselves and bargain." Party member Liu Jinxian and Youth League member Cai Dangsuo said: "How high his consciousness is! If we were all like him, everything would be easy!" Township branch secretary Hou Shuli said: "He is a party member, and we are also party members. Although the work is different, we are all doing socialist work. This time, in the unified purchase and sale, our party members must lead the whole cooperative and improve our own thinking a step further, so that we can be worthy of Comrade Zhang Zifang." On the spot, the party members and Youth League members all expressed: We guarantee to sell all our surplus grain, and at the same time, we must persuade our family members; and we decided to assign a few households to each party member and Youth League member by production team to do a good job in the publicity work of unified purchase and sale.

    The ideological preparation matured. On the third night, a general meeting of all cooperative members was held. At the meeting, the cooperative members all expressed: According to the actual situation, we will sell as much surplus grain as we have. When many farmers in the whole township were still hesitating whether to sell surplus grain "honestly" and were still considering whether to join or organize agricultural production cooperatives, the "May Third" Cooperative used its actions to give a powerful education to the masses of the whole township. They concentrated the surplus grain to be sold in one place and, according to the grain company's grain collection standards, first classified and inspected the grade themselves. On a sunny day, they lined up in a large team, carried the surplus grain, and beat drums, heading straight for the city gate warehouse. It took less than fifty minutes to sell it all, and they received the payment for the grain all at once. The procedures were simple, fast, and good. Twenty-one old cooperative members sold a total of more than 8,200 jin of surplus grain, exceeding the original planned task by nearly 40 percent; together with the surplus grain of the fourteen new cooperative members, they sold a total of more than 11,000 jin. In addition, they also sold about 2,000 jin of seed cotton.

    On the way, the grain delivery team kept hearing praise: "Agricultural production cooperatives are really good. Look at the surplus grain sold by one cooperative, which is almost equivalent to the surplus grain of half our township!" After the grain sale, the individual farmers in the Xialiu Village area became even closer to the cooperative members. Many people asked when the cooperative would expand again so that they could prepare to join.

    In order to further increase production, the cooperative purchased seven more oxen after selling the surplus grain, and also planned to buy a horse. The cooperative members automatically invested the money they got from selling the surplus grain in the cooperative. They built two public toilets and purchased forty urine jars; a flour mill that was planned before winter plowing also started grinding flour ahead of schedule because funds were available after the grain sale. They also planned to mobilize the cooperative members to buy a few half-grown pigs and hand them over to the flour mill for feeding; and they also planned to burn two kilns of lime. These would not only provide direct help for winter manure accumulation but also create preliminary conditions for the agricultural cooperative to operate a variety of economies. In addition, the whole cooperative and the individual cooperative members also returned more than 2 million yuan of state loans, saved more than 1.4 million yuan, and added more than 50 shares of credit cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives.

    When the unified purchase began, it happened that the supply of kerosene and cooking oil on the market was not timely. Some cooperative members were dissatisfied and said: "They say 'socialism' is good all day long, who knows that socialism hasn't arrived yet, and people's eyes are all blind (no oil for lighting at night), and intestines are all dried up (no oil for cooking)." The branch mobilized everyone to discuss: "Where did the grain, cotton, and oil crops go? Why is it not enough even if production has increased? What should we do?" According to the statistics of Hou Shuyun and other ten cooperative members (45 people), the consumption of cotton cloth in the past three years was as follows: In 1952, they only used 4.8 zhang of fine cloth; in 1953, it increased to 16.45 zhang; and in 1954, before the end of the year, they used 33.28 zhang. The consumption of oil also increased year by year. However, the output of oil crops and cotton did not increase that much. In addition, the number of factory workers has increased, the consumption of soldiers, government cadres, and school teachers and students has increased, and some farmers are unwilling to produce and sell agricultural products according to the state plan. How can we blame the supply and marketing cooperatives for selling less oil? Through this discussion, everyone understood the importance of the state's unified purchase and sale and the necessity of carrying out production according to the state plan. According to the characteristics of the cooperative's land and the requirements of the state, they formulated the 1955 crop planting plan and production increase plan. Then, the agricultural cooperative and the supply and marketing cooperative signed a contract to collectively solve the problems of kerosene, cooking oil consumption, and oil cake supply for the cooperative members' draft animals, and everyone was even more satisfied.

    In order to consolidate and improve the cooperative members' socialist ideology, the cooperative's party group and management committee organized another discussion. The content was: In the two unified purchases in 1954, how were your actual actions and ideological performance? What was your labor attitude after joining the cooperative? Did you humbly learn from others' production experience and patiently pass on technology to others? Are you concerned about the cooperative's public property? Are there any opinions between teams and teams, cooperative members and cooperative members? How are your contacts and assistance to farmers outside the cooperative? The method was: first inside the party and then outside the party; from the backbone to the masses. Party members and Youth League members made self-criticisms in the form of appraisals and put forward advantages and disadvantages; ordinary cooperative members exchanged opinions in the form of discussions; and finally, a general meeting of all cooperative members was held, and the township branch secretary and the cooperative's management committee made summaries. Everyone generally agreed with this discussion. Some cooperative members said: This time, the old and rotten sesame seeds are all exposed to the sun. Who did it right, who did it wrong, which things were done well, which things were not done well, what should be done, and what should not be done, everyone can see clearly. Now everyone has a direction!

    卢氏县“五三”农业生产合作社卖粮前后
    姚放
    一九五四年夏季国家统购粮食时，河南省卢氏县下柳村“五三”农业生产合作社的一部分社员思想上有些抵触。有些妇女社员看到自己丈夫把整布袋的粮食背出去，还“哭了一鼻子”。有的抱怨地说：“参加农业生产合作社，别的倒没有啥，就是卖余粮太蹩劲，一点马虎打不得，还不胜单干户自在咧！”
    秋后的统购统销工作开始的时候，中共乡支部召开了党员团员联席会，了解了社员的思想情况，感觉到了进一步提高社员的政治觉悟的必要。这时，恰巧乡支部书记、社长侯树立从北京参观苏联经济及文化建设成就展览会回来。就用他看到的一切向社员们作了一次生动的社会主义前途教育。接着，乡人民代表大会第一次会议结束后，代表们向全乡人民广泛宣传了支援解放台湾、支援灾区人民、支援工业建设的重要意义。社员们纷纷表示：“一定要以实际行动响应号召，给个体农民做出榜样来。”但是，待要“实际行动”的时候，许多人又踌躇了——社员们的思想并没有真正弄通。
    一个大雪纷飞的晚上，支部又召开了一次党员团员联席会议。在这次会上，大家学习了十一月十九日人民日报发表的一篇通讯：“向祖国报告”。这篇通讯里说：共产党员张自芳为了藏族人民，为了建设祖国的边疆，不怕饥饿、不怕寒冷，直到被大树压伤，快要流尽最后一滴血时，还念念不忘毛主席，念念不忘亲爱的党，念念不忘通车拉萨。大家都感动得说不出话来。沉默了一小会，共产党员乔友朋才抬起头来说：“比起张自芳同志，咱们真惭愧！人家那样艰苦工作为的是啥？咱们呆在家乡，不受冻，不受饿，做一点工作，动不动还要为自己打算，讲价钱。”党员刘进贤，团员蔡当锁说：
  “人家觉悟咋那样高！咱们要是都跟他一样，啥事情都好办了！”乡支部书记侯树立说：“人家是党员，咱们也是党员，虽然工作不一样，可是同样是做社会主义工作。这一次统购统销，我们党员要把全社带起来，把自己的思想提高一步，才对得起这位张自芳同志。”当场党员团员们都表示：保证全部卖出自己的余粮，同时还要说服自己家里的人；并且决定以生产队为单位，一个党员团员负责几户，把统购统销的宣传工作做好。
    思想酝酿成熟了。第三天晚上，召开了全体社员大会。会上，社员们都表示：根据实际情况，有多少余粮就卖多少。当全乡许多农民还在徘徊观望是不是要“实打实”地卖余粮，还在考虑是不是加入或组织农业生产合作社的时候，“五三”社用行动向全乡群众作了一次有力的教育。他们把要卖的余粮集中到一处，根据粮食公司收粮标准，自己先分类验了级。在一个大晴天，排着大队，挑上余粮，打着锣鼓，直奔城关仓库。不上五十分钟就全部卖完了，卖粮的款子也一次拿到，手续简便，又快又好，二十一户老社员，共计卖出余粮八千二百多斤，比原来预定的任务超过了将近百分之四十；连十四户新社员的余粮，总计卖出一万一千多斤。另外，还卖了两千斤左右籽棉。
    送粮队伍在路上不断听到赞美的声音：“农业生产合作社就是好，你看人家一个社卖的余粮，差不多顶咱小半个乡的余粮！”售粮后，下柳村一带的个体农民对社员们更显得亲近了，不少人打听社啥时候再扩大，好准备参加。
    为了进一步提高生产，社里卖了余粮后添购了七条耕牛，还打算买一匹马。社员们自动把卖余粮得到的钱向社里投资。他们修建了两个公共厕所，添购了四十个尿缸；冬耕前筹划建设的一座粉坊，卖粮以后也因为资金能够周转而提前开始磨粉了。他们还准备发动社员买几条半大的猪交给粉坊喂养；并且准备烧两窑石灰。这些，不仅对于冬季积肥有直接的帮助，而且也给农业社经营多种经济创造了初步的条件。此外，全社和社员个人，还归还国家贷款二百多万元，储蓄了一百四十多万元，增添了五十多股信用社和供销社的股金。
    统购开始时，恰巧市场上灯油、食油供应不及时。一部分社员不满意地说：“成天说‘社会主义’好，谁知道社会主义还没来到，把人眼睛都过瞎了（晚上点灯没油），肠子都烤干了（吃菜没油）。”支部就发动大家讨论：“粮食、棉花、油料到哪里去了？为什么增产了还不够用？应该怎么办？”据侯树云等十户社员（四十五人）的统计，三年来棉布消费情况是这样的：一九五二年他们只用了细布四丈八尺；一九五三年增加到十六丈四尺五；一九五四年还没到年底，就用了三十三丈二尺八。油的消费也一年比一年多。可是，油料棉花的产量，却没有增长那么多。加上工厂工人多了，部队战士、机关干部、学校师生消费量的增加，再加上有些农民不肯按照国家计划生产和出卖农产品，怎么能怪供销社卖油少呢？通过这样讨论，大家明白了国家实行统购统销的重要意义和按照国家计划进行生产的必要性。他们按照社里土地的特性和国家的要求，制定了一九五五年作物种植计划和增产计划。接着，农业社又和供销社订立了合同，集体解决了社员们的灯油、食油消费和耕畜油饼的供应问题，大家更满意了。
    为了巩固和提高社员们的社会主义思想，社里的党小组和管理委员会又组织了一次讨论。内容是：在一九五四年两次统购中，自己的实际行动和思想表现咋样？入社后的劳动态度怎样？是不是虚心学习别人生产经验和耐心地给别人传授技术？对社里公共财产是不是关心？队和队、社员和社员之间是不是有意见？对社外农民的联系和帮助咋样？方法是：先党内后党外；由骨干到群众。党员团员以鉴定的方式作自我检查，并提优缺点；一般社员以座谈的形式交换意见；最后开全体社员大会，由乡支部书记和社的管理委员会作总结。大家对这一次讨论，一般的都很赞成。有些社员说：这一次陈谷子、烂芝麻一齐晒出来，谁做的很对，谁做的不对，哪件事做得好，哪件事做得不好，哪些该做，哪些不该做，大家都看得清清楚楚的。今后大家都有个方向了！
