Xinhua News Agency, February 26th, Berlin dispatch: As the West German Federal Assembly, defying the will of the vast majority of the German people, discusses the ratification of the Paris Agreement, rallies and demonstrations against re-militarization and for negotiations on the peaceful restoration of national unity are unfolding vigorously throughout Germany.

A tense political atmosphere prevails in Bonn. Many delegations representing residents from different strata have arrived from all over West Germany. Despite the police's terror tactics, a demonstration against the Paris Agreement was held around 4:00 PM on the 24th. Workers, youth, and women marched with banners reading: "Mothers protect your sons," "We want homes, not barracks," "Butter instead of cannons," "Down with the Paris Agreement," "Down with Adenauer."

The police used batons and water cannons against these demonstrators. According to a United Press report, the demonstrators fought with police wielding wooden clubs.

That evening, over a thousand more demonstrators marched to the parliament building, where they were blocked by the police.

Large-scale rallies and demonstrations were also held in other West German cities. In Munich, 40,000 people participated in the protest demonstration. In Bremerhaven, 5,000 workers from the largest industrial enterprises participated in a rally organized by the West German Trade Union Confederation demanding the reunification of Germany. In Hamburg, over 4,000 young men and women from various youth groups participated in a torchlight parade. In Embsen, 2,000 people held a rally demanding that members of the Federal Assembly vote against the ratification of the Paris Agreement. A large-scale protest rally was also held in Duisburg. The working people of eastern Germany, responding to the call of the Presidium of the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany to make February 24th a day of national struggle, launched a movement to fight for the reunification of Germany and against the Paris Agreement. In these few days alone, the working people of the German Democratic Republic wrote nearly 800,000 letters to the members of the Federal Assembly, urging them to vote against the Paris Agreement. They warned that if the Paris Agreement were implemented, they would be prepared to support the government's measures to strengthen the security of the German Democratic Republic and maintain peace in Europe with all their might.

In Leipzig, Suhl, Magdeburg, Cottbus, Stalinstadt, and the democratic sector of Berlin, millions of residents held grand rallies, unanimously demanding pan-German understanding.

Chairman of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, Dieckmann, gave a speech at a press conference in Berlin on the 24th, warning the members of the West German Federal Assembly not to ratify the Paris Agreement. He said: The German people will justly judge the members who vote in favor of the Paris Agreement. Dieckmann once again appealed to the West German Federal Assembly to join hands with the People's Chamber and reach a pan-German understanding through talks.

Xinhua News Agency, February 26th, Berlin dispatch via TASS: The West German Federal Assembly continues its final debate on the ratification of the Paris Agreement.

Social Democratic Party member Wiener emphasized at the afternoon session on the 24th that it was necessary to hold four-power negotiations on the German question before ratifying the Paris Agreement. He criticized the Western countries for abandoning their own demand, which had been agreed to by the Soviet Union, for free all-German elections under international supervision. Wiener, on behalf of the Social Democratic Party faction, proposed that the agreements on Germany's accession to the Western European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should only come into effect one week after the Federal Assembly has made a decision stating that new four-power negotiations on the reunification of Germany have proven fruitless.

Next, Jühler of the Free Democratic Party and Lemaire of the Christian Democratic Union spoke. They defended Adenauer's policies, attempting to prove that Adenauer was supposedly advocating for the reunification of Germany.

Chairman of the German Party faction, Macaz, did not even want to pretend to be a supporter of reunification, and he even said that it would not be wrong if the regional border (the line between East and West Germany) became a national border. Members of parliament expressed outrage at his brazen statement.

Schabel of the Christian Democratic Union, Brandt, chairman of the West Berlin parliament, and Strauss, a member of the Christian Social Union, all spoke in favor of ratifying the Paris Agreement. Social Democratic Party member Hansen spoke, and he vehemently refuted the revanchist Strauss.

At the beginning of the session on the 25th, Wiener of the Social Democratic Party, on behalf of his parliamentary group, moved to remove the second and third readings of the Paris Agreement from the agenda and once again expressed his advocacy for negotiations on the reunification of Germany. Wiener said that those who insisted on ratification were violating the will of the majority of the German people, and according to statistics from the West German polling institute, 56 percent of those surveyed supported holding negotiations before ratification. However, the reactionary majority of the Federal Assembly rejected the motion of the Social Democratic Party's parliamentary group. After this, the second reading discussion continued.

    西德联邦议院继续辩论巴黎协定
    全德人民反对军国主义化的运动汹涌展开
    【新华社二十六日讯】柏林消息：正当西德联邦议院违反绝大多数德国人民的意志，讨论关于批准巴黎协定的问题的时候，反对重新军国主义化、争取举行关于和平恢复国家统一的谈判的集会和示威，在全德境内汹涌展开。
    紧张的政治气氛笼罩着波恩。代表不同阶层居民的许多代表团从西德各地来到了那里。不顾警察的恐怖措施，在二十四日下午四时左右举行了一次反对巴黎协定的示威。工人、青年和妇女们高举着横旗游行，旗上写着：“母亲们保卫你们的儿子”，“我们要家、不要兵营”，“用牛油来代替大炮”，“打倒巴黎协定”，“打倒阿登纳”。
    警察用短棒和水龙对付这些示威者。据合众社报道，示威者同持木棍的警察打起来了。
    当天傍晚，另有一千多名示威者结队前往议会大厦，受到了警察的阻拦。
    西德其他城市同样也举行了大规模的集会和示威。慕尼黑有四万人参加了抗议示威。在不来梅港，有五千个在最大的工业企业中做工的工人参加了西德工会联合会组织的要求重新统一德国的集会。在汉堡，不同的青年团体的四千多名青年男女参加了火炬游行。在艾姆升，两千人举行集会，要求联邦议院的议员们投票反对批准巴黎协定。在杜伊斯堡也举行了一次大规模的抗议集会。德国东部的劳动人民响应民主德国全国阵线全国委员会主席团关于把二月二十四日作为民族斗争日的号召，展开了争取重新统一德国、反对巴黎协定的运动。就在这几天里，德意志民主共和国的劳动人民几乎给联邦议院的议员们写了八十万封信，要求他们投票反对巴黎协定。他们警告说，如果巴黎协定竟然付诸实施，他们准备用一切力量来支持政府所采取的加强德意志民主共和国的安全和维护欧洲和平的措施。
    在来比锡、苏尔、马格德堡、考特布斯、斯大林斯塔特和柏林民主区，几百万居民举行了壮大的集会，一致要求全德谅解。
    德意志民主共和国人民议院主席狄克曼二十四日在柏林举行的记者招待会上发表谈话，警告西德联邦议院的议员们不要批准巴黎协定。他说：德国人民将对投票赞成巴黎协定的议员进行正义的审判。狄克曼再一次吁请西德联邦议院同人民议院携起手来，用会谈来达成全德谅解。
    【新华社二十六日讯】据塔斯社柏林讯：西德联邦议院继续进行关于批准巴黎协定的最后辩论。
    社会民主党议员维纳在二十四日下午会议上强调指出，在批准巴黎协定以前有必要就德国问题举行四国谈判。他指斥西方国家背弃了它们自己提出而已经被苏联同意的关于在国际监督下举行全德自由选举的要求。维纳代表社会民主党党团建议：只有在联邦议院作出决议，指出四国关于德国重新统一的新的谈判已证明是没有结果之后一星期，关于德国加入西欧联盟和北大西洋集团的协定才能生效。
    接着，自由民主党的尤勒和基督教民主联盟的勒麦尔发言。他们为阿登纳的政策强辩，企图证明阿登纳是所谓主张重新统一德国的。
    德意志党党团主席麦卡兹甚至不想假装成一个拥护重新统一的人，他竟然说，假如区域边界
  （东、西德国之间的界线）变成了一条国界也没有什么不对的地方。议员们对他这种蛮横的发言纷纷表示愤慨。
    基督教民主联盟的沙贝尔、西柏林议会主席勃兰特和基督教社会联盟议员史特劳斯都发言赞成批准巴黎协定。社会民主党议员汉森发言，他猛烈地驳斥了复仇主义者史特劳斯。
    二十五日会议一开始，社会民主党的维纳代表他的议会党团动议把巴黎协定的二读和三读从议程上撤消，并再一次表示主张就德国重新统一问题举行谈判。维纳说，那些坚持主张批准的人是违反大多数德国人民意志的，根据西德民意测验所的统计数字，在民意测验所进行了测验的人中，有百分之五十六主张在批准前举行谈判。但是，联邦议院的反动多数拒绝了社会民主党议会党团的动议。在这之后，二读讨论继续进行。
