Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 26th: The "Indonesia News" reported on the 25th that Indonesian government figures told the newspaper that the purpose of the Bangkok Conference was to undermine the Geneva Accords and enslave the people of Asia. It threatens peace in Asia, including Indonesia. Government figures said that the Asian-African Conference has a responsibility to defeat the conspiracy of the Bangkok Conference to undermine the Asian-African Conference.
Xinhua News Agency, February 26th: The Vietnam News Agency published a commentary on the Bangkok Conference on the 25th, saying that, like the Manila Conference recently planned by the US imperialists, the Bangkok Conference follows a purpose of instigating war and aggression. US imperialists and their servants are planning to disregard the spirit and text of the Geneva Accords and clearly drag South Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos into the aggressive Southeast Asia group. Concurrently with the convening of the Bangkok Conference, US imperialists and their agents have recently incited a series of serious incidents in Vietnam that undermine the Geneva Accords; and in Laos, they have used armed forces to penetrate into the assembly areas of the Laotian fighting forces, establish strongholds, and plunder the local people.
Simultaneous with the above-mentioned sabotage actions, the newspapers and radio stations of US imperialists and their servants have never stopped the slander that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is "obstructing" people from moving to the South, demanding the "abolition" of the Geneva Accords, and opposing free general elections to unify the country. They also insisted that the Laotian fighting forces had "attacked" the Royal Lao forces. They were so shameless as to insult the Vietnam International Supervisory and Supervisory Commission and demanded its dissolution.
The commentary pointed out that these actions are used to realize the joint plan of the US imperialists and the French colonialists who are undermining the armistice agreement. This plan is to prepare public opinion and create favorable conditions for taking more serious actions at the Bangkok Conference to undermine the Geneva Accords and peace.
The commentary concluded that no matter what issues the imperialists may discuss regarding Vietnam and Indochina at the Bangkok Conference, the people of Indochina and the people of the world have already told and will tell them: "The people of Indochina and the people of the world will severely condemn the Bangkok Conference and the serious acts of sabotage of the armistice agreement carried out by the imperialists."
Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 26th: Bandung's "People's Will" newspaper said on the 24th that the purpose of the Bangkok Conference is to protect the interests of the imperialists in Southeast Asia, and therefore it is in direct conflict with the independence of Southeast Asian countries.
The newspaper pointed out that on the surface, the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is aimed at communism, but in reality, its purpose is to protect the interests of imperialism. Because the "communism" referred to by the imperialists is the struggle for independence, and any struggle for independence is bound to undermine the interests of imperialism.
Makassar's "People's Guide" newspaper also wrote on the 24th that the Bangkok Conference will intensify international tensions.
"The Balance" newspaper said that the Bangkok Conference cannot consider issues from the perspective of Southeast Asia's interests.
Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, February 26th: Indian newspapers continue to condemn the Manila Treaty Organization member states meeting held in Bangkok.
The "Free Press" said on the 25th that the Bangkok Conference is a "typical example" of the United States' disregard for democracy in international policy. The newspaper emphasized that most Asian countries are unwilling to participate in this group and condemned it for violating the will of Asian countries and establishing an Asian military alliance. "Free Press" expressed opposition to the United States' support for Asian reactionary regimes. "Free Press" said that the United States cannot achieve its goals by relying on "strength diplomacy."
The "Glory" newspaper published an editorial on the 26th, saying, "All the clamor about democracy and freedom issued by the member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization are nothing but deceptive. Their true purpose is to ensure the political, trade, and military interests of the United States, Britain, and France." The editorial revealed that the United States and Western countries are extremely alarmed by the growing national movements in Southeast Asian countries. The editorial said that they believe that any national movement in the Southeast Asian region is dangerous to their desire to establish their markets in these regions. Therefore, Western countries established this alliance to support Asian reactionary regimes and maintain their continued power.
The editorial also condemned the United States for not recognizing China's legitimate rights and forcibly occupying China's territory of Taiwan.
The "Hindustan Daily" said in an editorial on the 25th: Most Southeast Asian countries have not participated in the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Therefore, it must be remembered that the opinions and decisions of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries are not the opinions and decisions of Southeast Asia. The editorial pointed out that the activities of the United States in the world and Southeast Asia are threatening world peace.
The "Hindustan Flag" said on the 25th that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is a tool for non-Asian countries to directly interfere in the internal affairs of Southeast Asia.
The "Tribune" said in an editorial on the 25th that the purpose of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization member states meeting is to organize military institutions. The editorial said, "Without the cooperation of all Asian countries—including China—peace and stability in Asia and the Far East cannot be maintained."
The "Hindustan Times" and the "Indian Express" also published editorials on the 25th condemning the Bangkok Conference.

    印度尼西亚政府人士和亚洲国家舆论
    斥责曼谷会议阴谋破坏日内瓦协定
    【新华社雅加达二十六日电】二十五日的“印度尼西亚新闻”报道，印度尼西亚政府人士对这家报纸说，曼谷会议的目的是在于破坏日内瓦协定和奴役亚洲人民。它威胁着包括印度尼西亚在内的亚洲和平。政府人士说，亚非会议有责任击败曼谷会议破坏亚非会议的阴谋。
    【新华社二十六日讯】越南通讯社二十五日就曼谷会议发表评论说，正如最近美帝国主义者策划的马尼拉会议一样，曼谷会议是遵循一种挑拨战争和侵略的目的。美帝国主义者和他们的仆从国正打算无视日内瓦协定的精神和文字，把南越、柬埔寨和老挝明确地拉入侵略性的东南亚集团，和召开曼谷会议同时，美帝国主义者和他们的代理人最近在越南煽动起一连串严重破坏日内瓦协定的事件；并且在老挝使用了武装部队，深入寮国战斗部队的集结区，建立据点和抢劫当地人民。
    和上述的破坏行动同时，美国帝国主义者及其仆从的报纸和广播电台从来没有停止过这种诬蔑：越南民主共和国政府“阻挠”人们迁到南方去，要求“废除”日内瓦协定并且反对举行自由普选来统一这个国家。他们还硬说，寮国战斗部队曾“攻击”老挝王国部队。他们无耻到这种地步以至辱骂越南国际监督和监察委员会，并且要求解散这个委员会。
    评论指出，这些行动是用来实现美帝国主义者和破坏停战协定的法国殖民者的共同计划的，这个计划就是准备舆论和创造有利的条件以便在曼谷会议上采取更严重的行动来破坏日内瓦协定与和平。
    评论最后说，不管帝国主义者在曼谷会议上可能讨论关于越南和印度支那的什么问题，印度支那各国人民和全世界的人民已经告诉过并且将要告诉他们：“印度支那各国人民和全世界人民将严厉谴责曼谷会议和帝国主义者所进行的严重破坏停战协定的行为”。
    【新华社雅加达二十六日电】万隆的“人民意志报”二十四日说，曼谷会议的目的是在于保护帝国主义者在东南亚的利益，因此它和东南亚国家的独立是直接抵触的。
    报纸指出，从表面上看来，东南亚条约组织是针对共产主义的，但是实际上它的目的是在于保护帝国主义的利益。因为帝国主义者所指的“共产主义”就是争取独立的斗争，而任何争取独立的斗争是一定要破坏帝国主义的利益的。
    望加锡的“人民向导报”也在二十四日写道，曼谷会议将加剧国际紧张局势。
    “天平报”说，曼谷会议是不可能从东南亚的利益来考虑问题的。
    【新华社新德里二十六日电】印度报纸继续斥责在曼谷举行的马尼拉条约组织成员国会议。
    二十五日的“自由新闻”说，曼谷会议是美国在国际政策方面蔑视民主的一个“典型例子”。报纸着重指出，大多数亚洲国家不愿意参加这个集团，并谴责它违背亚洲国家的意志，建立亚洲军事联盟。“自由新闻”表示反对美国支持亚洲反动政权。“自由新闻”说，美国借助“实力外交”是达不到它的目的的。
    “光荣报”二十六日发表社论说，“东南亚条约组织成员国所发出的一切关于民主和自由的叫嚷都不过是骗骗人的，它们真正的目的是确保美、英、法三国的政治、贸易和军事的利益。”社论揭露，美国和西方国家对东南亚国家内的日益壮大的民族运动极感惊慌，社论说，它们认为在东南亚地区里的任何民族运动对于它们想在这些地区里建立它们的市场都是危险的。因此，西方国家建立这个联盟来支持亚洲反动政权，维持他们继续当权。
    社论还谴责美国不承认中国的合法权利，强占中国领土台湾。
    “印度斯坦日报”二十五日的社论说：大多数东南亚国家都没有参加东南亚条约组织，因此，必须记住，东南亚条约组织国家的意见和决定，并不是东南亚的意见和决定。社论指出，美国在世界和东南亚地区的活动正威胁着世界和平。
    二十五日的“印度斯坦旗报”说，东南亚条约组织是非亚洲国家对东南亚内部事务进行直接干涉的工具。
    “论坛报”二十五日的社论指出，东南亚条约组织成员国会议的目的是组织军事机构。社论说，
  “没有所有亚洲国家——包括中国在内的合作，亚洲和远东的和平和稳定就不能得到维护。”
      “印度斯坦时报”和“印度快报”也都在二十五日发表社论谴责曼谷会议。
