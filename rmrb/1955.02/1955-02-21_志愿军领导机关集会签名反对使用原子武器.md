    志愿军领导机关集会签名反对使用原子武器
    【新华社平壤二十日电】中国人民志愿军领导机关各部门和直属部队，十九日分别举行反对使用原子武器签名集会。
    许多单位的会场上张贴着大幅标语，有的写着：“一个名字一个力量，亿万个名字就是铜墙铁壁！”各个会上都宣读了世界和平理事会常务委员会的“告全世界人民书”。各部门和直属部队首长都在会上讲话，号召全体军人踊跃参加签名运动。许多干部、战士也都在会上发言反对使用原子武器。警卫营二等功臣副排长赵凤珍说：“我亲眼看见过美帝国主义屠杀朝鲜人民的惨状。我们绝不能容许和平的敌人妄想发动原子战争屠杀人类。我们签名就是坚决保卫和平的宣誓，就是对拿原子武器来恐吓中国人民的美帝国主义的严重警告。”医务工作者宋宝荣说：“我们反对原子武器，但是绝不怕原子武器。美帝国主义如果胆敢发动原子战争，那末灭亡的不是全人类，而是美帝国主义者自己！”
    参加集会的人都当场签了名，并表示要以继续保卫朝鲜停战协定，争取和平解决朝鲜问题的实际行动，来表示自己反对使用原子武器和保卫和平的决心。目前，反对使用原子武器的签名运动，正在志愿军各部队深入开展中。
