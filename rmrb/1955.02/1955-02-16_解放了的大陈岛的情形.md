    Our correspondent reports on the situation on liberated Dachen Island: On the morning of February 14th, we landed on the northeast end of Upper Dachen Island, at Guding Reef, this island which has just returned to the embrace of the motherland. The landing craft we were on docked below a cliff several dozen feet high. Looking up, in the crevices of those rocks and on the rocks close to the sea, were still the barbed wire entanglements set up by the Chiang bandit troops before their escape, with flares hanging on them. On every ladder carved into the rock that could be climbed, the Chiang bandit troops had buried mines and explosives. However, the engineering troops of our army who landed here yesterday had already cleared countless barbed wire entanglements and various explosive devices for us. The five-star red flag is already flying over Height 211.
    Although the Chiang bandit troops have been evacuated for two days, the materials that the bandits set fire to and were unable to evacuate are still smoldering, emitting a pungent, acrid smell. On both sides of the road leading to Da'ao Village, American gasoline drums are piled up everywhere. When the bandits fled, they used American gasoline to burn down the houses of the island's residents and the American-style tin houses, ammunition depots, granaries, trucks, jeeps, rice, soybeans, etc., that the bandits themselves lived in. All the island's residents were taken away, livestock was looted, and furniture such as pots, basins, benches, and chairs were smashed.
    From the traces of destruction and robbery by the Chiang bandit troops, we can see how frantically the bandits fled. The wires, docks, and generators in the radar room, which they did not have time to destroy, were left untouched. Bullets, diaries, registers, fish, and flour were scattered everywhere. Some boxes that had already been moved to the dock were abandoned there because they did not have time to transport them. In the southeast of Dachen Island, there are open liquor bottles and American canned goods everywhere; the bandits fled in a hurry without even having time to eat.
    On the liberated Dachen Island, we can still see various traces of our air force and artillery units bombarding the Chiang bandit troops' positions in the past. Many of the Chiang bandit troops' artillery positions were blown to pieces, some bunkers had half of their roofs blown off by bombs, and many vehicles were riddled with holes by our military aircraft strafing. The wreckage of the Chiang bandit "Zhong" class landing ship that was destroyed by our bomber formations on January 10th is still stranded on the beach near Da'ao Village.
    Now, follow-up troops of our People's Liberation Army are entering Dachen Island in a steady stream along the landing routes opened up by the engineering troops.

    解放了的大陈岛的情形
    本社记者报道解放了的大陈岛的情形说：二月十四日清晨，我们在上大陈岛东北端的崮定礁登上了这个刚刚回到祖国怀抱的海岛。我们所乘的登陆艇是靠在一个数丈高的峭岩下面，仰头上望，在那些岩缝里和接近海水的岩石上还保存着蒋贼军撤逃前架设的铁丝网，上面挂着照明雷。在凡是可以攀登的岩梯上，蒋贼军都埋伏了地雷和炸药。但是，昨天在这里登陆的我军工兵部队已为我们排除了无数的铁丝网和各种爆破物。五星红旗已经飘扬在二一一高地上。
    蒋贼军撤逃虽然已经两天了，但是，被匪徒们纵火焚烧的来不及撤运的物资还在冒着浓烟，发出一阵阵焦臭气味。在通向大岙里的公路两侧，到处都乱堆着美国汽油桶。匪徒撤逃时就是用美国汽油来烧毁了岛上居民的房屋和匪徒们自己住的美式铁皮房、弹药库、粮库、卡车、吉普车以及大米、黄豆等。岛上的居民全被抓走了，牲畜被劫走了，锅、盆、凳、椅等家具都被砸碎了。
    从蒋贼军破坏和抢劫的罪迹里，我们可以看到匪徒们是如何慌忙逃跑的。来不及破坏的电线、码头和雷达室里的发电机等，还原封未动地放在那里。子弹、日记本、表册、鱼和面粉等弃散得到处都是。有些已经搬到码头上的箱子，来不及运走又丢弃在码头上。在大陈岛东南部，到处都是打开了盖子的酒瓶和美国罐头，匪徒们来不及吃就不顾一切地逃走了。
    在解放后的大陈岛上，我们还可以看到过去我空军和炮兵部队轰击蒋贼军阵地的各种遗迹，原来蒋贼军的很多炮兵阵地都被炸得乱七八糟，有的碉堡被炸弹掀去半边，许多车辆被我军飞机扫射得千疮百孔。一月十日被我轰炸机群炸毁的蒋贼中字号登陆舰的残骸还搁浅在大岙里附近的海滩上。
    现在，我人民解放军后续部队正在工兵部队开辟的登陆道路上，源源地进驻大陈岛。（新华社）
