Strengthen the Struggle for Peace, Resolutely Oppose the Threat of War

The Chinese people warmly welcome the recent session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. This meeting is of great historical significance. In the struggle between peace and war, people all over the world see from here that the lofty banner of peace is flying victoriously, while the forces of war are suffering a heavy blow.

On February 8, Vyacheslav Molotov, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the USSR, delivered a report on the International Situation and the Foreign Policy of the Soviet Government at this meeting. On February 9, Nikolai Bulganin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, delivered a speech. Molotov's report and Bulganin's speech correctly analyzed the development of the international situation, pointed out the root causes of the current international tension and the threat of war, demonstrated the Soviet people's strong power and resolute attitude in safeguarding their security and guaranteeing peace, issued a serious warning to the planners of a new war, and reaffirmed the Soviet Union's unwavering policy of strengthening peace forces and promoting the easing of international tensions.

At the same time, on February 9, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union issued a declaration announcing the Soviet Union's firm position on major international issues, advocating direct contact between national parliaments, and welcoming any steps they take to strengthen international peace.

These communiques from the Soviet government leaders on the international situation and the solemn declaration of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union exposed the essence of the imperialist "policy of strength," heightened the vigilance of the people of all countries against the threat of war, and strengthened the confidence of the people of all countries in intensifying the struggle for peace.

In the ten years since the end of World War II, eleven countries in Europe and Asia have successively broken away from the imperialist system, united around the Soviet Union, and formed the socialist democratic camp. The rock-solid unity of the socialist and democratic camp countries headed by the Soviet Union, and the powerful development of these countries to varying degrees, clearly mark the profound qualitative changes in the international situation after World War II. At the same time, other important countries in Asia, such as India, Indonesia, and Burma, have also broken away from the shackles of colonial rule and embarked on the road of independent development. All this has greatly weakened the imperialist system and benefited the democratic and socialist forces.

However, the imperialist countries, especially the American billionaires, are unwilling to accept this new situation. The evil desire in the hearts of the American and British capitalists has always been to overthrow socialism, to overthrow the regime of the working people in the people's democratic countries, in order to restore the rule of landlords and capitalists in these countries. Although their conspiracy has been constantly defeated and is bound to fail, they are still unwilling to accept defeat. They are willing to prepare a new world war, even an atomic war, to restore imperialist rule throughout the world. This is the root cause of international tension, and the bloody essence of the American so-called "position of strength" policy.

In contrast to the American "position of strength" policy, the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries have consistently pursued a foreign policy of easing international tensions. This policy is based on the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. According to this principle, the Soviet Union has developed, and is continuing to develop, friendly and cooperative relations with many countries with different social systems. The People's Republic of China has also established and promoted mutual relations with India and other important Asian countries and other countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This peaceful foreign policy of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries is a decisive factor in consolidating and promoting the cause of world peace.

Regardless of the consistent efforts of the Soviet Union, China, the people's democratic countries, and countries such as India to ease international tensions, the American aggressive bloc and its followers are recklessly engaged in arms expansion and war preparations, and are establishing military bases all over the world, piecing together aggressive military blocs. In the West, the American aggressive bloc and its followers stubbornly reject the Soviet Union's plan to establish a European collective security system and consolidate European peace. It uses every means to force Western European countries to ratify the Paris Agreements, which revive German militarism, and expand the aggressive alliance of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In this alliance, they attempt to use the revived Hitler Wehrmacht as a shock force to attack the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. In the East, the American aggressive bloc harbors deep hatred for the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence announced by the People's Republic of China and India and Burma. The American aggressive bloc and its followers have organized a series of aggressive military alliances here, and are still plotting more aggressive military alliances. The American aggressive bloc hopes to use these military blocs it has established in Europe, the Middle East, the Near East, and Asia to form a global aggressive war system, to form a military encirclement of the Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries. This arrogant policy of the United States has greatly increased the threat of a new war.

At present, the whole world is watching the situation in Taiwan. The Taiwan issue clearly demonstrates the American aggressive bloc's arrogant ambition to overthrow the People's Republic of China.

Recently, after the United States signed the US-Chiang "Mutual Defense Treaty" with Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, the public enemy of the Chinese people, it issued a war message, passed a war resolution, and declared to the world that it would occupy Taiwan and Penghu for a long time, armed intervention in China's internal affairs, draw its defense line within Chinese territory, and prepare to expand its aggression against China. American naval and air forces are stationed in the Taiwan Strait and along our coast, participating in the military activities of the Chiang bandit clique. The US government is also attempting to further seize our coastal islands as a bridgehead for its attack on the Chinese mainland. Various warmongers of the American aggressive bloc are also making endless war cries and atomic weapon intimidations against our country, attempting to force the Chinese people to tolerate the American occupation of Taiwan, Penghu and the coastal islands, sever China, in preparation for a new war.

Six hundred million Chinese people are determined to liberate Taiwan, Penghu, and the coastal islands. This is our people's sacred struggle to defend our territorial sovereignty and our independence. Our solemn determination is unshakable and unchangeable. All American armed forces must withdraw from Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait. The liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair and no foreign interference is allowed. Peace-loving people and just forces all over the world support us. The entire democratic and socialist camp stands on our side. Our just cause is invincible.

The American occupation of Taiwan, interference in China's internal affairs, and war threats against the Chinese people also threaten the peace and security of other Asian countries. It is clear that in the American aggressive bloc's war plan, Taiwan is not only a springboard for their planned attack on the Chinese mainland, but also a military base for their planned launching of an Asian war of aggression. The United States has made it clear that the US-Chiang treaty is a link in its Pacific "security system." The United States is engaged in this aggressive system, first of all, to interfere in the internal affairs of Asian countries, infringe on the sovereignty and independence of Asian countries, and realize its new colonial rule in Asia. Any independent and autonomous policy of Asian countries is regarded by the United States as an obstacle to the implementation of its war policy. It is trying its best to expand the scope of control of the Manila Treaty. It wants to turn South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia into its bases. Propagandists of the American aggressive bloc often slander and defame the peaceful policies advocated by Asian countries such as India, Burma, and Indonesia in various ways, attempting to force them to follow the United States. Therefore, opposing American interference in the internal affairs of Asian countries and safeguarding the sovereignty and independence of their own countries is of particular importance to the peace and security of the Asian people.

It should be pointed out that the American aggressive bloc's policy of antagonizing the cause of world peace has reached such an extent that they are openly propagating preparations for an atomic war, and even clamoring to wage an atomic war. The atomic war threats constantly issued by American generals and officials to various countries have aroused the indignation of all upright human beings. The World Peace Council has issued a call to launch a large-scale movement against atomic war worldwide. This is a powerful answer to such clamoring and threats. In this regard, it is clear that the United States is not in a position of strength. The American aggressive bloc not only no longer occupies a monopoly position in atomic weapons, but, as Molotov announced, the Soviet Union has made such achievements in the manufacture of hydrogen weapons that it is not the Soviet Union that lags behind, but the United States. In this situation, the Soviet Union, on the one hand, adheres to its consistent advocacy of prohibiting the use of atomic weapons and all weapons of mass destruction, and at the same time proposes that the United States should not compete in the production of atomic weapons, but should compete in the peaceful use of atomic energy. The moral strength of this action by the Soviet Union further exposes the shameful face of the American atomic blackmail policy.

In any case, the peace-loving people of all countries must not underestimate the aggressive policy of the American aggressive bloc and the measures to prepare for a new war. People should clearly realize that due to the American policy of intensifying the threat of war and exacerbating international tensions, the threat to peace is increasing, and the danger of a new war is increasing. In this situation, the peace-loving people of all countries must constantly raise their vigilance, launch a more resolute struggle against the American conspiracy to plan a new war, and continue this struggle resolutely and consistently. Further strengthening the organized movement of peace-loving people in all countries to defend peace is the best way to prevent the warmongering forces from preparing a new war.

The countries of the democratic and socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, they do not threaten anyone, but they are not afraid of anyone's threats. The American aggressive war threat policy will not cause panic in these countries, on the contrary, the adventurous behavior of the aggressors can only lead to resolute resistance. People know that, in view of the serious situation that the Paris Agreements, which revive German militarism, will cause once they are ratified, the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries of Europe have announced that they are prepared to take necessary measures to ensure security. The Chinese people will resolutely support these measures. We believe that the peace and security of Europe are closely related to our peace and security. The six hundred million people of China have tremendous material and human resources. We will contribute our strength in all aspects and stand shoulder to shoulder with the great Soviet people, the people of the people's democratic countries, and all peace-loving people in Europe to fight for the noble cause of defending peace.

In the struggle to consolidate peace and ensure the security of the countries of the socialist camp, the Soviet Union occupies a particularly important position. It is a strong pillar for maintaining the cause of world peace and the friendship of the people of all countries. The powerful development of the Soviet Union is the most vivid proof of the unmatched strength of socialism.

The Soviet Union, China, and the people's democratic countries have consistently made efforts to ease international tensions, and will continue to wage unremitting struggles for this noble goal. If the American aggressive bloc thinks that this indicates that we are weak and can be bullied, and wants to impose war on the peace-loving countries regardless of everything, then history will surely punish the aggressors severely once again.

### 加强和平斗争，坚决反对战争威胁

    加强和平斗争，坚决反对战争威胁
    中国人民热烈地欢迎苏联最近召开的苏联最高苏维埃会议。这个会议具有巨大的历史意义。在和平与战争的斗争中，全世界人民从这里看到崇高的和平旗帜正在胜利地飞扬，而战争势力则正在受到沉重的打击。
    二月八日，苏联部长会议第一副主席、苏联外交部长莫洛托夫在这个会议上，作了关于国际局势和苏联政府的外交政策的报告。二月九日，苏联部长会议主席布尔加宁发表了演说。莫洛托夫的报告和布尔加宁的演说，正确地分析了国际局势的发展，指出了目前国际紧张局势和战争威胁的根源，表明了苏联人民维护自己的安全和保障和平的强大力量和坚决的态度，对新战争的策划者提出了严重的警告，并重申了苏联加强和平力量和促进缓和国际紧张局势的坚定不移的政策。
    同时，在二月九日，苏联最高苏维埃会议发表宣言，宣布了苏联在各项国际重大问题上的坚定立场，主张各国议会之间建立直接接触，欢迎它们为加强国际和平采取任何步骤。
    苏联政府领袖对国际局势的这些文告和苏联最高苏维埃的庄严宣言，揭穿了帝国主义的“实力”政策的实质，提高各国人民对战争威胁的警惕，加强了各国人民加紧争取和平的斗争的信心。
    第二次世界大战结束以来的十年中，在欧洲和亚洲已先后有十一个国家摆脱了帝国主义的体系，团结在苏联的周围，结成了社会主义民主阵营。以苏联为首的社会主义和民主阵营国家的坚如磐石的团结，和这些国家在不同程度上的强大发展，鲜明地标志出第二次世界大战之后的国际局势的深刻的质的变化。与此同时，亚洲其他的重要国家，像印度、印度尼西亚和缅甸，也都摆脱了殖民统治的桎梏，走上了独立发展的道路。这一切都大大地削弱了帝国主义体系，而有利于民主力量和社会主义力量。
    但是，帝国主义国家的，特别是美国的亿万富翁，他们不甘心于接受这种新的局势。美英大资本家心中一向怀着的邪恶愿望，是要推翻社会主义，推翻各人民民主国家中的劳动人民的政权，以便在这些国家中恢复地主和资本家的统治。尽管他们的这种阴谋不断遭到失败，并且是肯定地落空了，可是他们却死不甘心。他们不惜准备掀起新的世界战争，甚至原子战争来恢复帝国主义在全世界的统治。这就是国际紧张局势的根源，也就是美国的所谓“实力地位”政策的血腥实质。
    和美国的“实力地位”政策相对的，是苏联、中国和人民民主国家所一贯奉行的缓和国际紧张局势的外交政策。这个政策是建立在不同社会制度的国家和平共处的原则之上的。根据这个原则，苏联已同许多不同社会制度的国家发展了，并且正在继续发展着友好合作的关系。中华人民共和国也在和平共处的五项原则的基础上，同印度等亚洲的重要国家和其他国家建立和促进了相互之间的关系。苏联和人民民主国家这种和平外交政策，是巩固和增进世界和平事业的一个决定性的因素。
    不顾苏联、中国和人民民主国家和印度等国争取缓和国际紧张局势的一贯努力，美国侵略集团及其追随者不顾一切地进行扩军备战，并在世界各处建立军事基地，拼凑侵略性的军事集团。在西方，美国侵略集团及其追随者顽固地拒绝苏联关于建立欧洲集体安全体系、巩固欧洲和平的计划。它使尽一切手段，迫使西欧国家批准复活德国军国主义的巴黎协定，扩大北大西洋集团的侵略联盟。在这个联盟中，他们企图用复活起来的希特勒国防军作为向苏联和人民民主国家进攻的突击力量。在东方，美国侵略集团对于中华人民共和国和印度、缅甸所宣布的和平共处的五项原则，怀着深刻的仇视。美国侵略集团和它的追随者在这里组织了一系列的侵略性的军事联盟，并且还在策划更多的侵略性军事联盟。美国侵略集团希望用它在欧洲、中东近东和亚洲所建立的这些军事集团组成一个世界性的侵略战争体系，来形成对苏联、中国和各人民民主国家的军事包围。美国的这种狂妄政策，大大地增加了新战争的威胁。
    目前，全世界都注视着台湾的局势。在台湾问题上，鲜明地表现了美国侵略集团企图推翻中华人民共和国的狂妄野心。
    最近，美国竟在同中国人民的公敌蒋介石卖国集团签订美蒋“共同防御条约”之后，发表战争咨文，通过战争决议，向全世界宣告它要长期霸占台湾澎湖，武装干涉中国内政，把它的防线划在中国领土之内，准备扩大对中国的侵略。美国海空军陈兵台湾海峡和我国沿海，参与蒋贼集团的军事活动。美国政府还企图进一步侵占我国沿海岛屿，作为它进攻我国大陆的桥头堡。美国侵略集团的各种好战分子还正在对我国作出无休止的战争叫嚣和原子武器恫吓，企图迫使中国人民容忍美国侵占台湾澎湖和沿海岛屿，割裂中国，以准备新的战争。
    中国六万万人民坚定不移地要解放台湾澎湖和沿海岛屿。这是我国人民保卫我国领土主权、保卫我国独立的神圣斗争。我们的这个庄严决心不可动摇，不可改变。美国的一切武装力量必须从台湾和台湾海峡撤走，解放台湾是中国的内政，决不容许外来干涉。全世界爱好和平人民和全世界正义力量是支持我们的。整个民主和社会主义阵营站在我们的一边。我们正义的事业是不可战胜的。
    美国侵占台湾、干涉中国内政和对中国人民的战争威胁，也同样地威胁着亚洲其他国家的和平和安全。事情很显然，在美国侵略集团战争计划中，台湾不但是他们准备进攻中国大陆的跳板，并且也是他们准备发动亚洲侵略战争的军事基地。美国已经明白表示美蒋条约是它的太平洋“安全体系”的一个环节。美国搞这个侵略体系，首先就是要干涉亚洲国家的内政，侵犯亚洲国家的主权和独立，实现它在亚洲的新的殖民统治。任何亚洲国家的独立自主的政策，美国都看成是推行它的战争政策的障碍。它极力想扩大马尼拉条约的控制范围。它想把南越、老挝和柬埔寨都变成它的基地。美国侵略集团的宣传家常常从各方面诬蔑和诽谤印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚这些亚洲国家的主张和平的政策，企图迫使它们追随美国。因此，反对美国干涉亚洲国家的内政，维护自己国家的主权和独立，对于亚洲人民的和平和安全有特别重要的意义。
    应当指出，美国侵略集团同世界和平事业为敌的政策已经进行到了这样的程度：他们已在公开地宣传准备原子战争，甚至扬言要进行原子战争了。美国的将军和官员们不断对各国发出的原子战争威胁，引起了一切正直人类的愤慨。世界和平理事会已经发出号召，在全世界范围内展开大规模反对原子战争运动。这就是对这种叫嚣和威胁的有力回答。在这一方面，人们看得很清楚，美国并不是居于强有力的地位。美国侵略集团不但在原子武器方面早已不再占有垄断的地位，而且如莫洛托夫所宣布的，苏联在氢武器的制造方面已经取得了如此的成就，以致落在后面的不是苏联，而是美国了。在这种情况下，苏联一方面坚持其禁止使用原子武器和一切大规模毁灭性的武器的一贯主张，同时并建议美国不要在生产原子武器方面进行竞赛，而是在和平利用原子能方面进行竞赛。苏联的这种行动所具有的道义力量，进一步揭穿了美国原子讹诈政策的可耻的面目。
    无论如何，各国爱好和平的人民对于美国侵略集团的侵略政策和准备新战争的措施是不能估计不足的。人们应该清楚地认识到，由于美国加紧制造战争威胁和加剧国际紧张局势的政策，对和平的威胁正在增加，新战争的危险正在增加。在这种情况下，各国爱好和平的人民必须不断提高自己的警惕，对美国策划新战争的阴谋展开更加坚决的斗争，并且要把这一斗争坚决一贯地继续下去。进一步加强各国爱好和平人民有组织的保卫和平的运动是阻止好战势力准备新战争最好办法。
    以苏联为首的民主和社会主义阵营各国，它们不威胁任何人，但也不怕任何人威胁。美国的侵略战争威胁政策丝毫也不会引起这些国家的惊慌失措，相反的侵略者的冒险行为，却只能招致坚决的反击。人们都知道，鉴于复活德国军国主义的巴黎协定在一旦批准后将要造成的严重情势，苏联和欧洲各人民民主国家已经宣布它们准备采取保障安全的必要措施。中国人民将坚决支持这些措施。我们认为欧洲的和平和安全和我们的和平和安全息息相关。全中国六万万人民有着巨大的物力和人力。我们将在各方面拿出我们的力量，同伟大的苏联人民、各人民民主国家的人民和欧洲一切爱好和平人民肩并肩地站在一起，为保卫和平的崇高事业而奋斗。
    在巩固和平和保障社会主义阵营各国安全的斗争中，苏联占据着特别重要的地位。它是维护世界和平事业和各国人民友谊的强大支柱。苏联的强大发展，是社会主义力量不可匹敌的最生动的证明。
    苏联、中国和各人民民主国家为缓和国际紧张局势一贯地进行了努力，并将为着这个崇高的目标继续进行不懈的斗争。美国侵略集团如果以为这表示我们软弱可欺，想不顾一切地把战争强加在爱好和平国家的头上，那么，历史就一定会再一次狠狠地惩罚侵略者。
