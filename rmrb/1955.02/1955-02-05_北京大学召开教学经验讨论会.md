    Peking University Holds Teaching Experience Discussion Meeting

    Peking University held a "1954-1955 Academic Year Teaching Experience Discussion Meeting" from January 27th to February 3rd. Participating in the meeting were all teachers, visiting teachers, and graduate students of Peking University, as well as over eighty guests from other schools.

    This "Teaching Experience Discussion Meeting" was the first school-wide, systematic meeting to exchange teaching experience since the teaching reform at Peking University. Its purpose was to promote teaching reform in terms of teaching methodology, implement the teaching plan, and improve teaching quality. The meeting focused on the introduction of experience and organization of discussions on issues related to teaching methodology. In various reports and discussions, criticism and self-criticism were initially carried out. The meeting emphasized the issues of cultivating students' materialist worldview and cultivating students' independent working ability in teaching work, and opposed the subjective tendency of disregarding students' actual ability to accept and comprehensively completing the teaching plan in teaching.

    Through this meeting, the teachers of Peking University felt that they had gained a lot. The main thing was to change the past incorrect views of relatively neglecting teaching methodology work and thinking that it was "good enough". Through the reports of Soviet experts and the exchange of experience from various departments, they also initially clarified the problems existing in teaching methodology, the direction of future work, and some specific methods for solving teaching methodology problems. They increased their enthusiasm for learning from Soviet experts and further corrected their attitude towards learning from Soviet experts. Therefore, this conference laid a solid foundation for Peking University to continue to learn from the Soviet Union, implement teaching reform, and improve teaching quality in the future. The Peking University school authorities and various departments are studying how to specifically implement the gains of the conference into future work. (Peking University Correspondence Group)

    北京大学召开教学经验讨论会
    北京大学在一月二十七日到二月三日召开了“一九五四—一九五五学年教学经验讨论会”。参加会议的有北京大学的全体教师、进修教师、研究生和八十余位外校来宾。
    这次“教学经验讨论会”是北京大学教学改革以来第一次全校性的有系统的交流教学经验的会议。其目的在于就教学法工作方面来推动教学改革，贯彻教学计划和提高教学质量。会议着重对教学法方面的问题作了经验介绍并组织了讨论。在各项报告和讨论中，初步地开展了批评和自我批评。会议着重提出了在教学工作培养学生的唯物主义世界观的问题和培养学生独立工作能力问题，反对了教学中不顾学生的实际接受能力和全面完成教学计划的主观主义倾向。
    经过此次会议，北京大学的教师们都感到有很大的收获。主要是改变了过去比较轻视教学法工作和认为搞得“差不多”的不正确看法。而通过苏联专家的报告和各系经验交流也初步明确了教学法中存在的问题，今后工作的努力方向，和解决教学法问题的若干具体办法。提高了向苏联专家学习的热情，进一步端正了向苏联专家学习的态度。因此，这次大会就为北京大学今后继续学习苏联贯彻教学改革、提高教学质量打下了稳固的基础。北京大学校部和各系正在研究如何把大会收获具体地贯彻到今后的工作中去。（北京大学通讯组）
