Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 2nd: "L'Humanité" published on February 1st the French National Peace Council's Appeal to the German People.

The Appeal to the German People stated: The French people are watching with great concern the German people's struggle against re-militarization. "The French people understand the German people's desire to reunify their country. They know that the division of Germany and Europe, which will be legalized by the London and Paris Agreements, is fraught with serious dangers."

The Appeal to the German People stated that the people of France and Germany, in opposing the re-militarization that would cause an arms race between East and West, and between France and Germany, are not only defending their national interests, but also the interests of world peace. They will use their concerted efforts to ensure that any attempt to drag them into war is doomed to failure. Their will cannot be ignored. They will ensure that the German question is resolved and German unity is restored through negotiations.

The Appeal to the German People stated: "The road to genuine reconciliation between our two countries will thus be opened. We will thus decisively advance the cause of disarmament, which is desired by all the peoples of the world."

    法国全国和平理事会发表告德国人民书
   【新华社二日讯】据塔斯社巴黎一日讯：“人道报”二月一日登载了法国全国和平理事会告德国人民书。
    告德国人民书说：法国人民正以很大的关心注视着德国人民反对重新军国主义化的斗争。“法国人民了解德国人民重新统一他们祖国的愿望。他们知道：将因伦敦和巴黎协定而合法化的德国和欧洲的分裂是充满了严重的危险的。”
    告德国人民书说，法德两国的人民反对将引起东西方之间、法国和德国之间的军备竞赛的重新军国主义化，不仅是在保卫他们的民族利益，而且还是在保卫全世界和平的利益。他们将用他们一致的努力来使得把他们拖进战争的任何企图遭到必然的失败。他们的意志是不容忽视的。他们将使得德国问题得到解决，并且通过谈判恢复德国的统一。
    告德国人民书说：“我们两国之间取得真正和解的道路将因此打开。我们将因此有决定意义地推进全世界各国人民所希望的裁军事业。”
