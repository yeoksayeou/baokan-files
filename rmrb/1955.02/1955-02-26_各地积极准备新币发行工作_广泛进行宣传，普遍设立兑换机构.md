Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Following the State Council's order regarding the issuance of new Renminbi currency and the withdrawal of the current Renminbi currency, various localities across the country have enthusiastically launched publicity efforts and preparations for the exchange.

    To ensure that the significance and regulations of the new Renminbi issuance are known to every household, tens of thousands of propagandists and speakers have been dispatched across the country, going deep into factories, government offices, schools, and neighborhoods to conduct publicity. In Tianjin, tens of thousands of speakers and propagandists held report meetings in factories, government offices, schools, and neighborhoods. After listening to the reports, people from all walks of life unanimously expressed their enthusiastic support for the issuance of the new Renminbi. Workers at the state-owned Tianjin No. 3 Cotton Textile Factory proposed guarantees, including publicizing to the masses and refraining from panic withdrawals. In Tianjin, more than 40,000 shop assistants and industrialists and businessmen from private shops have held separate meetings. The shop assistants guaranteed to ensure the supply of goods, urge capitalists to implement clearly marked prices, and prevent private merchants from engaging in speculative activities. In Wuhan, more than 11,500 speakers and propagandists have been holding report meetings and forums in factories, schools, and neighborhoods for days. Many factory workers and neighborhood residents have signed covenants, guaranteeing to exchange old currency in an organized manner after the new currency begins circulating, and to prevent and report illegal activities such as speculation by lawbreakers at any time during the new currency issuance. Industrialists and businessmen in Wuhan also guaranteed that they would not arbitrarily raise prices, lower prices, hoard goods for speculation, or engage in speculative purchases during the issuance of the new currency. In Chongqing, more than 20,000 propagandists publicized the significance of the new currency issuance among the masses. After listening to the propagandists' reports, many workers and students from factories, government offices, schools, and organizations stated that they would abide by order during the exchange; some prepared to register and centralize the old currency of their units, and have accountants go to the bank for unified exchange. Many workers and residents deposited their existing Renminbi in banks, which would exchange it on their behalf. Employees of state-owned stores are converting the old currency prices of goods into new currency. Shop assistants in private stores are assisting and urging capitalists to carry out clear and marked pricing based on the existing prices of goods, ensuring that the conversion between new and old currencies is absolutely accurate. After the State Council's order was announced, state-owned stores in Guiyang immediately marked the prices of goods in both new and old currencies according to the exchange rate. Seeing that prices had not changed at all, the citizens felt even more at ease. The Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee issued instructions, emphasizing that all localities should do a good job of publicizing and explaining the issuance of the new currency, so that the broad masses of people clearly understand the important significance of issuing the new currency, the advantages of the new currency, and how to exchange the old currency for the new currency. At the same time, they should also educate the people to raise their vigilance and strictly prevent and report rumors and sabotage by speculators and saboteurs.

    Various localities have also actively carried out preparatory work for the issuance of new currency and the withdrawal of old currency. The Henan Branch of the People's Bank of China has transported a sufficient amount of new currency to various counties. 142 exchange points and 55 mobile groups have been set up in the five cities of Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Luoyang, Xinxiang, and Anyang. In the vast countryside, an exchange station will be set up in every market town. More than 10,000 credit cooperatives throughout the province will be entrusted by the bank to undertake the exchange work in rural areas. In addition, the bank also plans to organize many mobile exchange groups to go specifically to remote mountainous areas and remote areas to exchange new currency for farmers. The Liaoning Branch of the People's Bank of China and its 46 county and city branches have prepared enough new Renminbi for the local people to exchange. The provincial branch has also printed the exchange ratio and exchange methods for new and old currencies into leaflets and distributed them to various cities and vast rural areas. The original teller staff of the Shenyang Branch have been trained, and another 200 people will be drawn on March 1st to strengthen the teller counters. All business units of the Xi'an Branch of the People's Bank of China have cleared their entire inventory. To facilitate the masses to exchange new Renminbi, exchange institutions will be widely established from March 1st, and post offices and supply and marketing cooperatives will be entrusted to act as agents for exchange work. Some exchange institutions are contacting factories, government offices, schools, and other units to arrange collective exchange dates. The Xi'an Branch and relevant departments recently also convened financial cadres from factories, enterprises, and government offices throughout the city to teach them how to transfer accounts and concentrate on exchange. Chongqing is preparing to establish more than 170 new currency exchange institutions. In addition to accountants and tellers, each exchange point is also equipped with service personnel to help the masses fill out exchange forms. The first batch of accounting business personnel above the team leader level have been trained, and general accounting, teller, and other personnel are currently being trained.
