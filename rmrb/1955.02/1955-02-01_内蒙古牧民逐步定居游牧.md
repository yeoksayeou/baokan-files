    Inner Mongolian herdsmen on the grasslands are gradually implementing settled nomadic grazing. In the pure nomadic area of the New Barag Left Banner, sixty settled animal husbandry mutual aid teams have been established. Each settled area is equipped with livestock sheds and fodder. The elderly, pregnant women, and children who are unable to migrate nomadically have settled down to raise weak livestock. Many earthen houses have also been built in the nomadic area of the Zhenglan Banner, protecting the health of women and children. The population has increased by more than seven hundred people in four years.
    In some settled grazing areas of the Chahar and Zhaowuda Leagues, livestock only graze near the settled areas, and cannot get good grass. Their physical condition gradually weakens, and the reproduction rate decreases. These areas are now advocating shifting pasture grazing. After autumn nomadic grazing last year, the more than 60,000 livestock in the Balinyou Banner were all fat and strong, and the conception rate of female animals also increased. Since 1950, the Shangdu Xianghuang United Banner has changed from settled grazing to settled nomadic grazing, and the number of livestock has increased by more than one and a half times.

    内蒙古牧民逐步定居游牧
    内蒙古草原上的蒙族牧民正在逐步实行定居游牧。纯游牧区的新巴尔虎左翼旗，已经建立了六十个定居饲养互助组，每个定居地都设有畜舍和草料，不能游牧的老人、孕妇和小孩都定居下来，来饲养瘦弱的牲畜。正蓝旗游牧区也盖起了许多土房，妇女和儿童的健康得到保护，四年内人口已增加了七百多人。
    在察哈尔、昭乌达等盟有些定居定牧区，畜群只在定居地附近放牧，吃不到好草，体质渐弱，繁殖率降低，这些地方现在正提倡移场放牧。巴林右翼旗的六万多头牲畜，去年经过秋季游牧后，都已膘满肉肥，母畜受胎率也提高了。商都厢黄联合旗自一九五○年开始改变定居定牧为定居游牧，牲畜头数已增加一倍半以上。　　　　　　　（新华社）
