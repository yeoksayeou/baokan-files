    The United States' occupation of China's territory, Taiwan, is the root of the tense situation in the Far East. The recent intensification of war-mongering by the United States in the Taiwan area has seriously aggravated the tense situation in the Far East and increased the risk of a new war. In order to eliminate the war threat caused by the United States, the Deputy Representative of the Soviet Union to the United Nations Security Council, Sobolev, was instructed on January 30 to request the Security Council to convene an emergency meeting to consider the United States' acts of aggression against China in the Taiwan area. In a letter to the President of the Security Council, Munro, Sobolev advocated condemning the United States' acts of aggression against China, suggesting that the United States immediately take steps to stop its aggression against China and its interference in China's internal affairs, and withdraw U.S. air, sea, and land forces from Taiwan and all other territories belonging to China, and called upon all parties to prevent military action in the Taiwan area in order to facilitate the withdrawal of all armed forces not belonging to the People's Republic of China from the islands in that area.
    The proposal put forward by the Soviet representative is in line with the common desire of all people who are truly concerned about peace. If the Security Council is truly to shoulder the solemn responsibility of maintaining peace, it should consider the Soviet proposal without delay.
    Since the United States armed occupation of China's territory, Taiwan, in July 1950, there has been a tense situation in the Taiwan area. The U.S. Seventh Fleet entrenched in the Taiwan Strait has long constituted an aggression against China and a threat to the security of China and the Far East. The U.S. government also signed the so-called "Mutual Defense Treaty" with the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique last December, "legalizing" the U.S. occupation of Taiwan. Recently, the U.S. President submitted a special message to the U.S. Congress, openly stating that he would "prepare to take appropriate military action" against the Chinese people's just struggle to liberate Taiwan, and the U.S. Congress has passed a resolution granting the U.S. President the power to launch such a war. At the same time, the United States has also dispatched a large number of naval and air forces to the Taiwan area for military activities. Among them are not only aircraft carriers, heavy cruisers, destroyers, and other ships transferred from the Philippines, Hong Kong, Japan, and other places, as well as ships sailing to Taiwan from Singapore, but also the U.S. Air Force's 18th Fighter-Bomber Wing and part of the 19th Fighter-Bomber Wing, which have also been transferred to Taiwan. U.S. military leaders stationed in the Far East, including Seventh Fleet Commander Pride, Task Force 72 Commander Kivette, and Fifth Air Force Commander, have also arrived in Taiwan one after another to conduct military planning.
    This series of recent actions by the United States is a naked war threat and war provocation against the Chinese people. It has further aggravated the tense situation in the Taiwan area caused by the U.S. aggressive actions. Public opinion in various countries has felt serious anxiety about this. An editorial in the "Hindustan Standard" on January 27 pointed out that the United States' use of armed forces to control Taiwan and the Penghu Islands "seems to increase the danger of war in the Far East."
    While creating a war threat in the Taiwan area, the United States is plotting a so-called ceasefire trick in the United Nations, using the excuse that the U.S. Navy and Air Force are stationed in the Taiwan Strait to help the remaining troops of the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique withdraw from Dachen Island. This excuse of the United States is itself a direct armed intervention in China's internal affairs. Moreover, things go far beyond this. U.S. Pacific Fleet Commander Stump publicly stated as early as January 21: "The Seventh Fleet is not only able to be responsible for the withdrawal of troops on Dachen Island, but also has the ability to repel attacks by the Chinese Communist Navy on outpost islands or Taiwan." This fully exposes the intention of the United States to gather its naval and air forces in the Taiwan area in preparation for a war of aggression against China.
    It can be seen that the proposal made by the Soviet Union to the Security Council is completely in line with the actual situation. Only by stopping the United States' interference in China's internal affairs and its military actions to create tension in the Taiwan area, and by withdrawing all its armed forces from the Taiwan area, can the situation in the Taiwan area and the Far East be eased. The United Nations Charter stipulates that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to "maintain international peace and security; and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace." The United States' actions in the Taiwan area constitute a serious breach of the peace, and the United Nations, according to its own Charter, has an unavoidable responsibility to stop this U.S. act of aggression.
    However, there is another activity currently in the Security Council, that is, the issue of requiring the Security Council to consider the "armed hostilities in the area of certain islands near the coast of mainland China" between the People's Republic of China and the Chiang Kai-shek traitorous clique, which is instigated by the United States and Britain and proposed by New Zealand. This is actually a concrete step in the ceasefire trick played by the United States. New Zealand's proposal does not mention the U.S. aggressive actions at all, but insists that the situation caused by the Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan and the coastal islands "if continued, may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security." This is completely a statement to cover up the U.S. aggressive actions. The Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan, Penghu, and the coastal islands is China's internal affair, and has nothing to do with others, and naturally will not threaten international peace and security. In fact, the Chinese people have liberated mainland China and many coastal islands, and have not caused any threat to international peace and security. It is precisely the United States that is threatening the security of China and the Far East, and threatening international peace. The proper course of action for New Zealand should be to withdraw its own proposal and support the Soviet proposal.
    New Zealand's proposal violates the United Nations Charter. Article 2, paragraph 7, of the United Nations Charter stipulates: "Nothing contained in the present Charter shall authorize the United Nations to intervene in matters which are essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of any state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to settlement under the present Charter." The event proposed by New Zealand is entirely an event that falls within China's internal affairs, and the United Nations has no right to discuss such matters.
    Now, the two proposals submitted to the Security Council, the right and wrong are very clear. If the Security Council is genuinely concerned about peace in the Taiwan area, it should recognize the facts, seriously discuss the Soviet proposal, to stop the U.S. destructive and aggressive crimes against peace, in order to ensure peace in the Taiwan area and the Far East.
    The Chinese People fully support the proposal made by the Soviet Union in the Security Council. The Chinese people must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, and the coastal islands, and will never allow anyone to interfere with our just struggle. As long as the United States stops all its aggressive actions against our country and withdraws all U.S. armed forces from the Taiwan area, the situation in the Taiwan area and the Far East can be eased.

### 安全理事会必须讨论苏联的建议

    安全理事会必须讨论苏联的建议
    美国侵占中国领土台湾，是远东局势紧张的根源。美国最近在台湾地区加紧制造战争的行为，已严重地加剧了远东的紧张局势，并且增加了新战争的危机。为了消除美国所造成的战争威胁，苏联驻联合国安全理事会副代表索波列夫于一月三十日奉命要求安全理事会召开紧急会议，考虑美国在台湾地区对中国的侵略行为。索波列夫在致安全理事会主席孟罗的函件中，主张谴责美国对中国的侵略行为，建议美国立即采取步骤停止对中国的侵略和对中国内政的干涉，并从台湾和属于中国的其他一切领土撤退美国的空、海、陆军部队，吁请任何一方防止在台湾地区的军事行动以便于不属于中华人民共和国的一切武装部队从那个地区的岛屿撤退。
    苏联代表所提出的这个建议，是符合于一切真正关心和平的人们的共同愿望的。安全理事会如果真正要负担起维护和平的庄严职责，就应当毫不拖延地考虑苏联的建议。
    自从美国于一九五○年七月武装侵占了中国的领土台湾以来，在台湾地区就一直存在着紧张局势。美国第七舰队盘踞在台湾海峡，早就构成了对中国的侵略和对中国以及远东的安全的威胁。美国政府并于去年十二月和蒋介石卖国集团签订了美蒋所谓“共同防御条约”，使美国侵占台湾的事实“合法化”。最近，美国总统向美国国会提出了一项特别咨文，更公开表示要对中国人民解放台湾的正义斗争“准备采取适当的军事行动”，而且美国国会已经通过给美国总统以发动这种战争的权力。与此同时，美国并调遣了大批海空军到台湾地区进行军事活动。其中不仅有已从菲律宾、香港、日本等地调来的航空母舰、重巡洋舰、驱逐舰等多艘，以及从新加坡正在向台湾驶来的舰只，并且还有美国空军第十八战斗轰炸机联队及第十九战斗轰炸机联队的一部分，也已移驻到台湾。美国驻在远东的军事首脑，包括第七舰队司令普赖德、第七十二特遣舰队司令基维特以及第五航空队司令也都陆续赶到台湾，进行军事策划。
    美国最近的这一系列的行动，是赤裸裸的对中国人民的战争威胁和战争挑衅。它使得由于美国的侵略行动而造成的台湾地区的紧张局势，更加恶化了。各国舆论对此已感到了严重的不安。“印度斯坦旗报”一月二十七日的社论就指出，美国使用武装部队控制台湾和澎湖列岛，“这似乎增加了远东的战争危机”。
    美国一面在台湾地区制造战争威胁，一面策动联合国进行所谓停火的诡计，借口说美国海空军陈兵台湾海峡是为了帮助蒋介石卖国集团的残余军队从大陈岛撤退。美国的这种借口的本身就是对中国内政的直接武装干涉。而且事情还远不止如此。美国太平洋舰队司令斯图普早在一月二十一日就公开说：“第七舰队不只能够负责撤退大陈岛上的部队，还有能力击退中国共产党海军对前哨岛屿或台湾的进攻”。这就完全暴露了美国把海空军集结在台湾地区的意图，是为了准备对中国的侵略战争。
    由此可见，苏联向安全理事会提出的建议是完全符合实际情况的。只有制止美国干涉中国内政、在台湾地区制造紧张的军事行动，并由美国从台湾地区撤走它的一切武装力量，台湾地区以及远东的局势才能得到缓和。联合国宪章规定，联合国的宗旨之一就是“维持国际和平及安全；并为此目的，采取有效集体办法，以防止且消除对于和平之威胁，制止侵略行为或其他对和平之破坏”。美国在台湾地区的所作所为构成了对和平的严重破坏，联合国根据它自己的宪章，有不可逃避的责任来制止美国的这种侵略行为。
    但是，在安全理事会中目前还有另外的一种活动，那就是由美国和英国所策动、由新西兰提出的要求安全理事会考虑中华人民共和国和蒋介石卖国集团“在中国大陆沿海附近的某些岛屿的地区发生武装敌对行动”的问题。这实际上就是美国玩弄的停火诡计的一个具体步骤。新西兰的这个建议根本不提美国的侵略行动，而硬说中国人民解放台湾和沿海岛屿的斗争所引起的局势“继续下去可能威胁国际和平和安全的保障”。这完全是掩盖美国侵略行为的说法。中国人民解放台湾、澎湖及沿海岛屿是中国的内政，根本不干别人的事，自然也不会威胁到国际的和平和安全。事实上，中国人民曾经解放了中国大陆和许多沿海岛屿，而并没有对国际和平和安全造成什么威胁。目前正是美国在威胁着中国和远东的安全，威胁着国际和平。新西兰的正当做法应该是收回它自己的建议，来支持苏联的建议才对。
    新西兰的建议是违反联合国宪章的。联合国宪章第二条第七款规定：“本宪章不得认为授权联合国干涉在本质上属于任何国家国内管辖之事件，且并不要求会员国将该项事件依本宪章提请解决”。新西兰提出的完全是属于中国的内政的事件，联合国根本无权讨论这种事情。
    现在，向安全理事会提出的两个建议，是非曲直是非常清楚的。安全理事会如果对于台湾地区的和平是真诚关怀的话，那就应该认清事实，认真地讨论苏联的建议，来制止美国破坏和平的侵略罪行，以保障台湾地区和远东的和平。
    中国人民完全支持苏联在安全理事会所提出的建议。中国人民一定要解放台湾、澎湖和沿海岛屿，并且绝不容许任何人对我们所进行的这种正义斗争进行干涉。只要美国停止对我国的一切侵略行为，从台湾地区撤退美国所有的武装力量，台湾地区和远东的局势就能够得到缓和。
