    Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd dispatch from Bonn: On the eve of the second reading debate in the West German Federal Parliament on the Paris Accords, people from all walks of life in West Germany are actively engaged in the struggle against the Paris Accords.
    West German workers and trade unions are the main force in the patriotic movement against the Paris Accords. Since the Third Congress of the West German Trade Union Confederation passed a resolution condemning the London Conference's decision to arm West Germany last October, several state branches of the West German Trade Union Confederation, such as Bavaria, Hesse, and Rhineland-Palatinate, have successively passed resolutions against the Paris Accords. The West German Trade Union Confederation also launched a signature campaign in late January for a "German Declaration" demanding negotiations to restore German unity before ratifying the Paris Accords. This movement has been widely launched among workers and people from other strata. The alliance strike of more than one million coal and steel workers in January put forward the slogan against the Paris Accords; in Lintorf and Muchenburg, workers from two factories took over the supervision of factory production in order to prevent employers from converting to arms production.
    The united action of workers under the influence of different parties and between workers in East and West Germany has been further developed. In places such as Bremerhaven and Nuremberg, workers from the Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, and non-party workers have often gathered together to oppose the Paris Accords. Not long ago, the West German Trade Union Confederation sent about 450 representatives to hold a meeting with representatives of East German workers to discuss intensifying the opposition to the rearmament of West Germany.
    Most young people oppose arming West Germany. According to the results of a survey on the rearmament of West Germany conducted by the West German "Hamburger Morgenpost," 60.7 percent of the young people surveyed were fundamentally opposed to the establishment of a West German army, 58.5 percent believed that this would increase the threat of war, and 64.7 percent emphasized that the establishment of a West German army would increase the difficulty of unifying Germany.
    Many well-known figures in West Germany's cultural and religious circles oppose the Paris Accords. Twelve hundred well-known scientists and cultural workers have signed a request for the four countries to negotiate a solution to the German question. Among the twenty-three bishops of the Protestant Church, twenty are opposed to the militarization policy; three thousand pastors are actively participating in this struggle.
    The intense emotions of people from all walks of life against the Paris Accords and demanding negotiations on the German question have affected the attitude of various parties in the Bonn parliament. The largest opposition party in West Germany, the Social Democratic Party, is currently not only opposing the ratification of the Paris Accords in parliament, but also carrying out a struggle against ratification outside parliament. The opinions within the various parties of the Adenauer government coalition are also not unified. The parliamentarians of these parties, especially some parliamentarians from the Free Democratic Party and the "All-German Bloc," issued calls for negotiations with the Soviet Union after the Soviet statement on January 15. A few days ago, a part of the parliamentarians of the coalition parties held a meeting in Bonn and refused to unconditionally support the Paris Accords. Even within Adenauer's party, the Christian Democratic Union, according to a poll, only slightly more than 50 percent of all party members supported the Paris Accords. According to a report by Washington "Star" reporter Brown, the State Department is paying attention to Bonn, believing it to be a place "in trouble" with regard to ratifying the Paris Accords.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 22nd dispatch from TASS, Paris, February 21st: The week of protest against the rearmament of West Germany, launched by the French National Peace Council, has ended in France. During this period, peace fighters did a lot of work among the masses. Many representatives in the local government institutions of several provinces firmly opposed the ratification of the Paris Accords.
    "L'Humanité" reported that thirty-one mayors and four hundred and eighty municipal councilors in the Bouches-du-Rhône province signed petitions protesting the arming of West Germany. In some urban areas of this province, all residents signed the petition.
    In the Haute-Vienne province, five hundred and seventy-eight municipal and provincial councilors expressed their opposition to the ratification of the Paris Accords. In the Bourdeaux-de-Romans area (Drôme province), ten of the fourteen mayors co-signed a letter to the members of the Senate of the Republic, asking them to vote against the ratification of the Paris Accords in the upcoming debate and to support general disarmament and peaceful coexistence among all countries.
    Xinhua News Agency, February 23rd dispatch from TASS, Paris, February 22nd: "L'Humanité" reported that one hundred mayors in the Gard province, more than five hundred municipal councilors and fifty mayors in the Nord province, six hundred and thirty municipal councilors in the Vienne province, and five hundred municipal councilors and one hundred mayors in the Charente province have formally expressed their opposition to the ratification of the Paris Accords. In the Ain province, the Aude province, the Dordogne province, and many other provinces, dozens of municipal councilors unanimously signed appeals to the members of the Senate of the Republic, asking them to vote against the ratification of the Paris Accords.
    "Libération" reported that the National Committee (France) of University Teachers Striving to Avoid the Threat of Another World War and the Organization of University Workers of Rhineland-Westphalia (West Germany) issued a joint statement against the arming of West Germany. The statement emphasized: "What can guarantee the peaceful development of our two peoples and the peaceful future of the whole world in the context of genuine Franco-German reconciliation is not a policy of force and threats, but a policy of consultation and agreement aimed at general disarmament." Many university professors in Bonn, Würzburg, Münster, and other cities in West Germany signed the statement.

    西德、法国人民坚决反对复活德国军国主义
    反对巴黎协定的运动声势浩大
      【新华社二十二日讯】　波恩消息：在西德联邦议院二读辩论巴黎协定前夕，西德各阶层人民正积极进行着反对巴黎协定的斗争。
    西德工人和工会是反对巴黎协定的爱国运动的主力军。自从去年十月西德工会联合会第三次代表大会通过谴责伦敦会议关于武装西德的决定的决议案以后，西德工会联合会所属的几个州的分会，如巴伐利亚州、黑森州、莱因—伐尔兹州的分会都先后通过了反对巴黎协定的决议。西德工会联合会并且在一月下旬发起了要求在批准巴黎协定前谈判恢复德国统一的“德国宣言”的签名运动，这个运动已经在工人和其他阶层人民中广泛展开。一月份一百多万煤钢工人的同盟罢工提出了反对巴黎协定的口号；在林托尔夫和穆亨堡，曾有两个工厂的工人为了不让雇主转业军火生产而接管了对工厂生产的监督。
    不同党派影响下的工人以及德国东、西部工人之间的统一行动已经进一步展开。在不来梅港、纽伦堡等地方，共产党、社会民主党和无党派的工人曾经常在一起集会反对巴黎协定。不久前，西德工会联合会派出约四百五十名代表同民主德国工人代表举行会议，讨论加紧反对重新武装西德的问题。
    大部分青年都反对武装西德。据西德“汉堡晨邮报”发表该报举行的关于重新武装西德的调查结果说：在被调查的青年中，有百分之六十点七的人根本反对建立西德军队，有百分之五十八点五的人认为这会增加战争威胁，有百分之六十四点七的人强调：建立西德军队将增加统一德国的困难。
    西德的文化界、宗教界有许多著名人士反对巴黎协定。一千二百个著名的科学和文化工作者已经签名要求四国谈判解决德国问题。在二十三个新教教会的主教中，有二十个主教是反对军国主义化政策的；有三千个牧师正在积极参加这一斗争。
    各阶层人民反对巴黎协定、要求谈判德国问题的激烈情绪影响了波恩议会各党派的态度。西德最大的反对党——社会民主党目前已经不仅在议会内反对批准巴黎协定，而且也在议会外进行反对批准的斗争。阿登纳政府联盟的各个党派内部的意见也不是一致的，这些党派的议员，首先是自由民主党和“全德集团”的某些议员，曾经在一月十五日苏联声明发表后，发出要求同苏联谈判的呼声，前几天，联盟各党的一部分议员在波恩举行会议，拒绝无条件支持巴黎协定。即使是在阿登纳的党——基督教民主联盟内，据一次民意测验的结果，赞成巴黎协定的只占全体党员的百分之五十多一点。据华盛顿“明星报”记者布朗报道，国务院正在注意着波恩，认为它是一个在批准巴黎协定方面“有麻烦”的地方。
    【新华社二十二日讯】　据塔斯社巴黎二十一日讯：在法国全国和平理事会发起下举行的抗议重新武装西德周已经在法国结束。在这期间，和平战士们在群众中间做了许多工作。若干省的地方政府机构中的许多代表都坚决反对批准巴黎协定。
    “人道报”报道，罗尼河口省的三十一位市长和四百八十位市议员都在抗议武装西德的请愿书上签了名。在这个省的某些市区中，所有的居民都在请愿书上签了名。
    在上维也纳省，有五百七十八名市议员和省议员表示他们反对批准巴黎协定。在布尔德帕什地区
  （德罗摩省），十四个市长中有十个联名写信给共和国参议院的议员们，要求他们在即将举行的辩论中，投票反对批准巴黎协定，并支持普遍裁减军备和所有国家之间的和平共处。
    【新华社二十三日讯】　据塔斯社巴黎二十二日讯：“人道报”报道，法国加尔省的一百个市长，北海滨省的五百多个市议员和五十个市长，维也纳省的六百三十个市议员，夏朗德省的五百个市议员和一百个市长已正式表示反对批准巴黎协定。在瑷茵省、奥德省、多顿涅省和其他许多省中，几十个市议会的市议员一致在给共和国参议院议员们的呼吁书上签了名，要求他们投票反对批准巴黎协定。
      “解放报”报道，高等学校教师争取避免另一次世界大战威胁全国委员会（法国）和莱因—威斯特伐利亚的大学工作者组织（西德）发表了一个反对武装西德的联合声明，声明强调：“能够在法德真正和解的情况下保证我们两国人民的和平发展和全世界的和平前途的，不是武力和威胁的政策，而是目的在于普遍裁减军备的协商和协议的政策。”波恩、威斯堡、昂斯特和西德其他各城市的许多大学教授都在这个声明上签了名。
