    Guo Moruo's Speech

    Dear comrades!

    Today is the anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Armed Forces. We are here in Lushun to hold the groundbreaking ceremony for the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Tower." Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese people, to express our highest respect and heartfelt gratitude to the great Soviet people and the Soviet Armed Forces.

    Since the great October Socialist Revolution opened a new era in human history, we, the Chinese people, have been constantly receiving the profound friendship of the Soviet people, absorbing the valuable experience of the Soviet revolution, studying Marxism-Leninism, and embarking on the road of liberation against imperialism and feudalism.

    In 1945, the invincible Soviet Armed Forces, having defeated Nazi Germany in the West, also defeated Japanese imperialism in the East. This gave powerful encouragement and assistance to our liberation struggle.

    Precisely because of this friendship and assistance, we, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, finally shattered the shackles of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism, achieved the great victory of the people's revolution, and established a new people's democratic China. Our great victory has once again greatly weakened the aggressive forces of imperialism.

    The fraternal friendship between our two peoples of China and the Soviet Union was further solidified in February 1950 by our solemn peace treaty – the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance. Over the past five years, a new type of international relations has developed extensively between our two countries.

    We thank the Soviet government for helping us build and expand 156 large industrial enterprises.

    We thank the Soviet government for sending a large number of outstanding experts to help us in our construction. Recently, they have also supplied us with atomic pile equipment and will provide us with scientific and technological assistance in promoting the research on the peaceful utilization of atomic energy.

    We thank the Soviet government for transferring the Chinese Changchun Railway, jointly managed by China and the Soviet Union, and other properties in Northeast China to us without compensation; the Lushun naval base, jointly used by China and the Soviet Union, along with the equipment in this area, will also be handed over to us for complete control.

    The assistance of the Soviet people and the Soviet government to us is comprehensive, systematic, and meticulous. This sincere assistance has promoted the development of our socialist construction, strengthened the forces defending peace in the Far East and the world, and inspired the confidence of all peace-loving people around the world that peace will prevail.

    We, the Chinese people, will further intensify our efforts, step up our learning, work harder, and strengthen our national defense to ensure the completion of the overall tasks of our socialist construction and transformation, so as not to disappoint the ardent expectations of the Soviet people and government for us.

    We, the Chinese people, will further strengthen the friendly cooperation between our two peoples and strengthen the unity of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp to strive for the overall victory of our common cause – defending world peace and promoting human progress.

    The fraternal friendship of 800 million people, solidified by the blood of martyrs, is undoubtedly a strong guarantee for our revolutionary achievements and labor achievements, and a strong guarantee for peace in the Far East and world peace.

    May the "Sino-Soviet Friendship Tower" we are building here in Lushun forever play the role of a lighthouse in safeguarding the cause of peace in the Far East and the world.

    Long live the founding anniversary of the powerful Soviet Armed Forces, the defenders of world peace!

    Long live the eternal development of Sino-Soviet friendship!

    Long live peace!

    郭沫若副团长的讲话亲爱的同志们！
    今天是苏联武装部队建军节，我们在这旅顺口举行“中苏友谊塔”奠基典礼，请让我代表中国人民对伟大的苏联人民和苏联武装部队首先表示崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢。
    自从伟大的十月社会主义革命在人类史中开辟了一个新纪元以来，我们中国人民就一直接受着苏联人民的深厚友谊，吸收着苏联革命的宝贵经验，学习着马克思列宁主义，走上了反对帝国主义和封建主义的解放的道路。
    一九四五年战无不胜的苏联武装部队，紧接着在西方打败了纳粹德国之后，在东方又把日本帝国主义打败了，这对于我们的解放斗争更特别地给予了有力的鼓舞和援助。
    就由于有这样的友谊和援助，我们中国人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导之下，终于粉碎了半封建半殖民地的枷锁，取得了人民革命的伟大胜利，建立了人民民主的新中国。我们的这一伟大胜利使帝国主义的侵略势力遭受到又一次的巨大的削弱。
    我们中苏两国人民的兄弟友谊，在一九五○年二月更由我们的庄严的和平条约——中苏友好同盟互助条约固定了下来。五年来，在我们两国之间的新型的国际关系有了很广阔的发展。
    我们感谢苏联政府先后帮助我们新建和扩建一百五十六项的巨大工业企业。
    我们感谢苏联政府派遣了大批的优秀的专家来帮助我们建设，最近更供给我们以原子堆的设备，在促进原子能和平利用的研究上并将给予我们以科学和技术上的援助。
    我们感谢苏联政府把中苏共同管理的中国长春铁路和其他在东北境内的财产无偿地移交给了我们；中苏共同使用的旅顺口海军根据地连同这一区域的设备也将交由我们完全支配。
    苏联人民和苏联政府对于我们的援助，就是这样，是全面的、有系统的、无微不至的。这样真诚的援助促进了我们社会主义建设事业的发展，加强了保卫远东和平和世界和平的力量，并鼓舞了全世界爱好和平人民的和平必胜的信心。
    我们中国人民今后将更进一步加紧努力，加紧学习，加紧工作，并加强国防力量，来保证我们社会主义建设和改造的总任务的完成，以期不负苏联人民和政府对于我们的热诚的期待。
    我们中国人民今后将更进一步加强我们两国人民之间的友好合作，并加强和平民主社会主义阵营的团结，来争取我们的共同事业——保卫世界和平和促进人类进步——的全面胜利。
    由烈士们的鲜血所凝固了的八万万人民的兄弟友谊，毫无疑问，是我们的革命成果和劳动成果的坚强保障，是远东和平与世界和平的坚强保障。
    祝我们在这旅顺口建立的“中苏友谊塔”在维护远东与世界和平事业中将永远发挥着灯塔的作用。
    世界和平的保卫者、强大的苏联武装部队的建军节万岁！
    中苏友谊永恒发展万岁！
    和平万岁！
