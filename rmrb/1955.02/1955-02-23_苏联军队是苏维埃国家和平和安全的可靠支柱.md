    The Soviet Army is a Reliable Pillar of Peace and Security for the Soviet State
    Soviet Army General K. Moskalenko
    On February 23rd, the Soviet people and all progressive mankind are commemorating the 37th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army and Navy. On this day, the working people of the Soviet state celebrate the glorious achievements of their armed forces in defending the fruits of the Great October Socialist Revolution and safeguarding the interests of the Soviet state.
    Our armed forces are the beloved sons and daughters of the Soviet people, and their well-deserved pride. The entire history of the Soviet Army is an example of loyal service to the people, and an example of bravery and heroism. The lofty tasks that the Soviet Army has completed and is carrying out, its high moral qualities and combat effectiveness, have won the love of the working people and the respect and admiration of the people all over the world.
    The Soviet Army is a new type of army. Whether in terms of its class essence or its aims and tasks, the Soviet Army is fundamentally different from the armies of all capitalist countries.
    The army of any bourgeois country is a tool for oppressing the working people and maintaining the rule of the capitalists.
    The Soviet Army is a truly people's army. Our people and the army are one entity, one family. The Soviet Army is inextricably linked to the people. It does not serve the exploiters, but the workers and peasants who have been liberated. It defends the interests of the working people. It deserves the title of liberator of all nationalities from oppression and enslavement. The Communist Party, founded by the great Lenin, is the organizer and leader of the Soviet armed forces, and the inspirer of its victories of world-historic significance. V.I. Lenin taught that the Soviet state must always be prepared to defend the achievements of socialism, so the people need a strong army. Lenin pointed out that with a consolidated army, we are invincible. Without a consolidated army, we would become an inevitable victim of the imperialist enslavers.
    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet armed forces have gone through a glorious path of struggle. It has grown and consolidated in countless battles against the enemies of the socialist motherland. Whenever the imperialists have attempted to deprive the Soviet people of their freedom and independence by force, and to restore capitalist enslavement in the Soviet state, the Soviet Army, with the active support of the entire people, has given the imperialist aggressors a crushing blow.
    In the years of the Civil War and foreign armed intervention, the Soviet Army crushed the combined forces of fourteen imperialist countries and the counter-revolutionary White Guards. Even then, the Soviet Army showed itself to be the best army in the world.
    During the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet armed forces fully demonstrated their unparalleled moral qualities and combat effectiveness, their infinite loyalty to the motherland, and their ability to defend the interests of the people. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Party Central Committee headed by Stalin, the Soviet Army achieved a victory of world-historic significance in defeating the powerful and brutal enemy that invaded the Soviet Union, adding immortal glory to its battle flag.
    In the battles of the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet people demonstrated countless heroic deeds. During the war years, nearly eleven million people received Soviet medals and awards for heroic acts and outstanding achievements. Ten thousand nine hundred and forty-three soldiers received the lofty title of Hero of the Soviet Union. Such a large number of heroic deeds is not and cannot be found in the armies of capitalist countries.
    Hitlerite Germany and its international imperialist inspirers believed that the Soviet state and its armed forces were weak, and therefore provoked the anti-Soviet war. But they miscalculated greatly. The war once again powerfully proved that the Soviet Army is an invincible army. The main source of its invincibility is the Soviet socialist system based on the solid foundation of the worker-peasant alliance. The industrialization of the country and the collectivization of agriculture, the friendship of all nationalities and Soviet patriotism, gave the Soviet Army a great invincible force.
    Relying on the powerful heavy industry established in the years of the pre-war Five-Year Plans, the Soviet people equipped their army with first-class combat technology and equipment, ensuring all the necessities for defeating the enemy. The Soviet combat technology and equipment, in terms of its quality, was superior to that of any capitalist country.
    The Soviet Army was able to successfully fulfill its duty to the motherland and defeat the enemy because it received the strong support of the entire rear and the people of all nationalities of the Soviet Union. During the war years, the working class, collective farmers, and people's intellectuals all created great labor achievements and strived for victory with their heroic efforts.
    The Second World War did not end according to the plans of the imperialists. They originally wanted to eliminate or at least weaken the socialist countries, but this plan failed. The Soviet armed forces not only defended the freedom and independence of the motherland, but also saved the people of Europe and Asia from fascist enslavement, enabling the people of many countries to be freed from the shackles of imperialism forever and embark on the road of democratic development and socialist construction. The great contribution of the Soviet people and their army in human history lies in this.
    That is why the people of all countries in the entire democratic camp and progressives all over the world are celebrating the annual Soviet Army Day together with the Soviet people. They regard the Soviet Army as an army of liberation, a hope and pillar of socialism and democracy, and a reliable fortress against imperialist reactionaries and aggression, and for world peace and security.

    The Soviet people and their army are commemorating the 37th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet Army and Navy in a situation of new achievements in the construction of communism in our country, a huge political and labor upsurge, and further consolidation of the strength and power of the motherland.
    The Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, are moving forward confidently in the struggle to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. New and great achievements have been made in the development of heavy industry—the strong foundation of the socialist economy, the basis for the further development of the entire national economy, and the guarantee of the inviolability of the borders of the Soviet motherland. Soviet heavy industrial output in 1954 has increased to 3.4 times that of 1940. On this basis, the transportation industry, the construction of new factories and residences, agriculture, and the production of daily necessities are developing smoothly, and the Soviet Army is being equipped with the latest combat technology and weapons.
    While striving for the further prosperity of the motherland and for the completion of the plan for peaceful communist construction, the Soviet people cannot but take into account that the reactionary imperialist forces are trying every possible means to create international tension and prepare to impose a new war on us. Therefore, the Communist Party and the Soviet government must more tirelessly care for the further consolidation of the strength of the Soviet state and the further improvement of the Soviet armed forces.
    The Soviet Union has consistently struggled for peace and international security. Its peace policy has been warmly supported by the people of all countries in the world, because this policy is in line with their fundamental and vital interests. The Soviet Union leads the great camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, which unites more than 900 million people. Thanks to the efforts of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other peace-loving countries, peace has been achieved in Korea and Indochina, and two dangerous hotbeds of war in Asia have been eliminated.
    But the facts show that the American imperialists and their British, French, and other followers are trying their best to complicate the international situation and launch a new world war. The American imperialists are using open acts of aggression to occupy Taiwan Island, which belongs to the People's Republic of China, and are brazenly interfering in China's internal affairs.
    Not long ago, the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council passed a resolution on the use of atomic weapons in the new war that this group is trying to launch. The criminal plan of the American aggressive forces, which have embarked on the road of preparing for an atomic war, has aroused the anger and most resolute condemnation of the people of all countries. The Soviet people, like all peace-loving mankind, warmly support the Vienna Conference of the World Peace Council's letter to the people of the world. Millions of people are signing this document, which will become a powerful weapon against the instigators of atomic war.
    Although the Soviet Union should possess atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons in order to defend the peaceful labor and life of its people, the Soviet government has consistently called for the prohibition of such weapons, and has put forward many important proposals for the use of atomic energy for peaceful purposes. The world's first atomic power station has been built in the Soviet Union and is supplying electricity to industry and agriculture.
    The policy of the enemies of peace and humanity is completely the opposite. The American imperialists are expanding their stockpile of atomic bombs and formulating plans for atomic war. The American and British ruling circles are reviving the West German revanchist army led by former Hitlerite generals, while millions of people and thousands of towns were killed and destroyed because of them. The American imperialists are also preparing to equip this army of murderers with atomic weapons in order to oppose the Soviet Union and other peace-loving countries.
    Under these conditions, the Soviet people and all freedom-loving people in all countries of the world have to take urgent measures to prevent aggression. At the Moscow European Conference on guaranteeing peace and security in Europe, the Soviet Union and the European People's Democracies openly declared that if West Germany is rearmed, the countries of the democratic camp will take joint measures in terms of organizing armed forces and command, and in strengthening their own defense forces.
                  ×　×　×
    The Soviet people are calmly and confidently looking forward to the future. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the Soviet government, they are striving to achieve new achievements in building a communist society and strengthening national defense. The Soviet people will not be intimidated by the threats and clamor of the instigators of war.
    The armed forces of the great Soviet motherland defend the peaceful labor of the Soviet people. At any time, they can cool down the feverish heads of any war adventurers and instigators and force them to respect the socialist achievements and the power of the Soviet Union.

    苏联军队是苏维埃国家和平和安全的可靠支柱
    苏联陆军大将  克·莫斯卡连科
    二月二十三日，苏联人民和全体进步人类都在纪念苏联陆军和海军建军三十七周年。苏维埃国家的劳动人民在这一天庆祝自己的武装力量保卫伟大十月社会主义革命成果和保卫苏联国家利益的光荣战绩。
    我国的武装力量是苏联人民亲爱的子弟兵，是他们的当之无愧的骄傲。苏联军队的整个历史，是忠诚地为人民服务的榜样，是勇敢和英雄主义的榜样。苏联军队所完成的和正在执行着的崇高任务，它的高度的道德品质和战斗素质，使苏联军队赢得了劳动人民的热爱，赢得了全世界人民的尊重和敬仰。 
    苏联军队是新型的军队。无论是按其阶级本质来说，或者是按其目的与任务来说，苏联军队同一切资本主义国家的军队有着根本的区别。
    任何资产阶级国家的军队，都是压迫劳动人民与维护资本家政权的工具。
    苏联军队是真正的人民的军队。我们的人民和军队是一个整体，是一个家庭。苏联军队同人民是血肉相关的。它不是为剥削者服务，而是为已经获得了解放的工人和农民服务。它保卫着劳动人民的利益。各族人民摆脱压迫和奴役的解放者的称号，它是当之无愧的。由伟大的列宁所缔造的共产党，是苏联武装力量的组织者和领导者，是它的具有全世界历史意义的胜利的鼓舞者。弗·伊·列宁教导说，苏维埃国家必须经常地准备保卫社会主义的成果，所以人民需要一支强大的军队。列宁指出，有了巩固的军队以后，我们就是不可战胜的。没有巩固的军队，我们就会成为帝国主义奴役者的不可避免的牺牲品。
    在共产党的领导之下，苏联武装力量经历了一条光荣的战斗道路。它在同社会主义祖国的敌人进行无数次战斗的过程中成长并巩固起来。每当帝国主义者企图以武力来剥夺苏联人民的自由和独立，来恢复在苏维埃国家内的资本主义的奴役时，苏联军队就在全体人民的积极支持下给予帝国主义侵犯者以歼灭性的打击。
    在国内战争和外国武装干涉的年代里，苏联军队粉碎了十四个帝国主义国家和反革命的白卫军的联合力量。还在那时，苏联军队就表现出自己是世界上的最好的军队。
    在伟大卫国战争的年代里，苏联武装力量充分地表现出了自己的无可比拟的道德品质和战斗素质，对于祖国的无限忠诚，以及保卫人民利益的本领。在共产党和以斯大林为首的党中央委员会的领导下，苏联军队取得战胜侵犯苏联的强大、残暴的敌人的具有世界历史意义的胜利，在自己的战斗旗帜上增添了不朽的光荣。
    在伟大卫国战争的战斗中，苏联人民表现出了无数的英勇事迹。在战争的年代里，有近一千一百万人由于英勇行为和功勋卓著而获得苏联的勋章和奖章。一万零九百四十三名军人得到了苏联英雄的崇高称号。在资本主义国家的军队里是没有也不可能有这样大量的英勇事迹的。
    希特勒德国及其国际帝国主义鼓舞者认为苏维埃国家及其武装力量是软弱的，因而挑起了反苏战争。但是他们大大地失算了。战争再一次有力地证明了：苏联军队是不可战胜的军队。它的不可战胜性的主要源泉，就是建立在工农联盟的巩固基础上的苏维埃社会主义制度。国家工业化和农业集体化，各民族的友谊和苏维埃爱国主义，给苏联军队以伟大的不可战胜的力量。
    依靠了在战前几个五年计划年代里建立起来的强大的重工业，苏联人民为自己的军队装备了头等的战斗技术装备，保证了战胜敌人的一切必需品。苏联的战斗技术装备，按其质量来说，是优越于任何资本主义国家的。
    苏联军队之所以能够顺利地完成自己对祖国所负的天职，击溃敌人，是由于它得到了整个后方与苏联各族人民的竭力支持。在战争的年代里，工人阶级、集体农民、人民知识分子都创造了巨大的劳动成绩，并以自己的英勇努力来争取胜利。
    第二次世界大战并不是按照帝国主义的计划结束的。它们原想消灭或者至少是削弱社会主义国家，但这种打算失败了。苏联的武装力量不仅捍卫了祖国的自由与独立，而且还从法西斯奴役下拯救了欧洲与亚洲的人民，使许多国家人民能够永远摆脱帝国主义的束缚，而走上民主发展和建设社会主义的道路。苏联人民及其军队在人类历史中的伟大功绩即在于此。
    正因为这样，现在整个民主阵营的各国人民和全世界的进步人士都同苏联人民一道来庆祝每年的苏军建军节。他们都把苏联军队看作解放者的军队、社会主义与民主的希望和支柱，看作是反对帝国主义反动派和侵略、争取世界和平与安全的可靠堡垒。

    苏联人民和他们的军队是在我国取得共产主义建设的新成就，在巨大的政治与劳动高涨、进一步巩固祖国的力量和威力的情况下来纪念苏联陆军和海军建军三十七周年的。
    共产党领导下的苏联人民，在为争取提前完成五年计划的斗争中，满怀信心地前进。在发展重工业——社会主义经济的强大基础、整个国民经济进一步发展的依据、苏维埃祖国边疆不可侵犯的保证——方面已获得了新的巨大成就。苏联一九五四年的重工业产量已增加为一九四○年的三点四倍。在这样的基础上，顺利地发展着运输业，新的工厂和住宅的建筑、农业、日用品生产，并以最新的战斗技术装备与武器来装备苏联军队。
    在争取祖国进一步繁荣，争取完成和平的共产主义建设的计划的同时，苏联人民不能不估计到，反动的帝国主义势力正在千方百计地制造国际紧张局势，准备把新战争强加在我们头上。因此共产党和苏联政府，要更加不倦地关怀苏维埃国家实力的进一步巩固，苏联武装力量的更加完善。
    苏联一贯地为争取和平与国际安全而斗争。它的和平政策受到了世界各国人民的热烈支持，因为这种政策是符合于他们的根本切身利益的。苏联领导着伟大的和平、民主和社会主义阵营，这个阵营团结着九亿以上的人民。由于苏联、中华人民共和国和其他爱好和平的国家的努力，已经在朝鲜和印度支那实现了和平，消除了亚洲的两个危险的战争温床。
    但是事实说明，美帝国主义者和它的英国、法国以及其他的追随者们，正在竭力企图使国际局势复杂化和发动新的世界战争。美帝国主义者用公开的侵略行动来侵占属于中华人民共和国的台湾岛，并且蛮横地干涉中国的内政。
    不久以前，侵略性的北大西洋联盟理事会通过了关于在这个集团力图发动的新战争中使用原子武器的决议。已经走上了准备原子战争道路的美国侵略势力的罪恶计划，激起了各国全体人民的愤怒和最坚决的谴责，苏联人民和所有爱好和平的人类一样，热烈地支持世界和平理事会维也纳会议的告全世界人民书。千百万人正在这个文件上签名，这个文件将成为反对原子战争挑拨者的有力武器。
    虽然苏联为了保卫本国人民的和平劳动和生活而应该掌握原子武器和氢武器，但苏联政府仍然一贯地要求禁止这种武器，并提出了把原子能用于和平目的的许多重要建议。在苏联已经建成了世界上第一个原子能电力站，并向工业与农业供电。
    和平和人类的敌人的政策却是完全相反。美帝国主义者正在扩大原子弹的储备，制订原子战争的计划。美英统治集团正在复活由前希特勒的将军们领导的西德复仇主义军队，而数百万人和数千个城镇就是因为他们而被杀害和破坏的。美帝国主义并且还准备用原子武器来装备这种杀人犯的军队，以便反对苏联和其他爱好和平的国家。
    在这些条件下，苏联人民和世界各国所有爱好自由的人民，就不得不采取紧急措施以防止侵略。在讨论保障欧洲和平和安全的莫斯科欧洲国家会议上，苏联和欧洲人民民主国家公开宣称，如果西德被重新武装起来，民主阵营的国家就要在组织武装力量和司令部方面，在加强自己的防御力量方面采取共同的措施。
                  ×　×　×
    苏联人民沉着地满怀信心地展望着未来。在共产党和苏联政府的领导下，他们在建设共产主义社会和加强国防力量方面，正在争取达到新成就。苏联人民不会被战争挑拨者的威胁和叫嚣吓倒的。
    伟大的苏维埃祖国的武装力量捍卫着苏联人民的和平劳动。在任何时候，他们都能够使任何战争冒险者和挑拨者的热昏的头脑冷静一些，强迫他们尊重苏联的社会主义成果和苏联的威力。
