Commodity Production under Socialism: Its Necessity and Characteristics

    The necessity of commodity production under the socialist system arises from the existence of two basic forms of socialist production: the state form and the collective farm form. In state-owned enterprises, the means of production and products are the property of the whole people. In collective farms, the means of production (draught animals and livestock for consumption, farm implements, farm buildings, etc.) and the products of collective farm production are group property, the property of cooperative collective farms. The basic and decisive means of agricultural production (land and agricultural machinery stations' machines) are owned by the state. Since the products of state-owned enterprises belong to the socialist state, and the products of collective farms belong to the collective farms, exchange through buying and selling becomes a necessary form of economic connection between industry and agriculture. Here, as with any buying and selling, the commodity holder loses ownership of the commodity, and the buyer becomes the owner of that commodity.

    Lenin pointed out that "the exchange of the products of large-scale ('socialized') industry for peasant products is the economic essence of socialism" [1], and at the same time pointed out that commodity exchange is a test of whether the mutual relationship between industry and agriculture is correct. Lenin's principles are applicable to the entire first stage of communism. The Soviet state mainly obtains grain for urban residents and raw materials for industry from collective farms and farmers through methods of acquisition and procurement. And collective farms and farmers can only obtain the monetary funds necessary to exchange for industrial products by selling their commodities to the state and cooperatives, or by selling them in the collective farm market.

    Therefore, agricultural products and raw materials that are transferred from collective farms to the state and cooperatives through acquisition and procurement, as well as agricultural products sold in the collective farm market, are all commodities. Industrial products (mainly personal consumer goods) produced by state-owned enterprises and purchased by collective farms and farmers are also commodities. Since personal consumer goods are commodities, they are transferred to urban residents through buying and selling.

    Commodity production under the socialist system is not ordinary commodity production, but a special kind of commodity production. It is commodity production without private ownership of the means of production and without the participation of capitalists. It is basically carried out by united socialist producers (the state, collective farms, cooperatives). Due to the establishment of public ownership of the means of production and the elimination of the wage labor system and the phenomenon of human exploitation, commodity production under the socialist system is subject to certain restrictions. Therefore, it cannot be transformed into capitalist production, and it serves the socialist society.

    Commodity production in socialist society is not unlimited and all-encompassing as it is under the capitalist system. Under the socialist system, the scope of commodity production and commodity circulation is mainly limited to personal consumer goods. In socialist society, labor power is not a commodity. Land and mineral resources are the property of the state and cannot be the object of buying, selling, or renting. State-owned enterprises—factories, mines, power stations, and their fixed production funds (production tools, houses, buildings, etc.)—cannot be bought or sold and can only be transferred from one state organ to another with special permission, and therefore are not commodities and are not objects of buying and selling.

    The means of production produced in the state-owned economy—machines, machine tools, metals, coal, oil, etc.—are distributed among state-owned enterprises. The national economic plan stipulates that each enterprise is allocated certain materials according to its production plan. These materials are supplied by the enterprises producing them to the enterprises consuming them based on contracts concluded with each other. When the means of production are transferred to an enterprise, the socialist state fully maintains its ownership of these means of production. The enterprise manager obtains the means of production from the socialist state but can never become their owner; he is only a state representative who uses the means of production in accordance with the state plan. Collective farms purchase automobiles, equipment needed for their public economy, and the simplest agricultural machines and tools. But the basic agricultural machines—tractors, combine harvesters, etc.—are not sold to the collective farms but are concentrated in state-owned enterprises, namely, agricultural machinery stations, which use these means of production to serve the collective farms. The means of production distributed among state-owned enterprises within the country are not commodities in essence. However, they retain the form of commodities and have prices, which are necessary for accounting and cost accounting.

    In the field of foreign trade, the means of production sold to foreign countries are commodities. Here there is buying and selling, and the owner of the commodity is changed.

The Use Value and Value of Commodities in the Socialist Economy

    In socialist society, those products that are produced and realized as commodities have both use value created by concrete labor and value created by abstract labor. In other words, under the socialist system, commodities have a dual nature, which is determined by the dual nature of the labor that produces them.

    The dual nature of labor under the socialist system is fundamentally different from the dual nature of labor in simple commodity economies and capitalist economies. Under the conditions of commodity production based on private ownership, the dual nature of labor that produces commodities reflects the contradiction between private labor and social labor. The socialist economy does not have this contradiction. As mentioned above, in the socialist economy, labor is not private labor, but direct social labor. Society plans the labor of workers in the production process in advance. The distribution of labor among various departments and enterprises of the national economy is planned. Therefore, in the socialist economy, commodity fetishism is eliminated, and the social relations between people do not have the false appearance of relations between things.

    However, under the socialist system, there is a distinction between direct social labor in state-owned enterprises (where labor has been socialized on a nationwide scale) and direct social labor in collective farms (where labor is only socialized within the scope of that agricultural labor association). In addition, collective farm members also use their labor in subordinate individual sideline occupations. Due to this difference in the degree of labor socialization, and due to the existence of commodity ties between state-owned industry and collective farms, it is not possible to directly express and compare the social labor used in the production of industrial products and the production of collective farm products in terms of labor time. Therefore, it is necessary to use value and the value form to indirectly measure social labor. This measurement is achieved by transforming the various concrete labors of workers and collective farm members into abstract labor that creates commodity value through commodity exchange.

    In the process of planning and leading the national economy, the socialist state considers both the use value and the value of commodities. The state requires its enterprises to produce a certain product, that is, a certain use value. Capitalists are interested in use value only because it is the bearer of value and surplus value, but in the socialist economy, creating use value and improving product quality are of great significance because production is carried out to meet the growing needs of the entire society as fully as possible.

    In the socialist economy, commodity value is also of great significance. The state plans production not only with physical indicators but also with monetary indicators. At the same time, continuously reducing the value of the commodities produced and lowering prices on this basis plays a significant role in ensuring the maximum satisfaction of the needs of society.

    In the socialist economy, the antagonistic contradiction between use value and value that contains the possibility of overproduction crises does not exist. The socialist economy guarantees the complete possibility of fulfilling the product production plan in both monetary and physical terms.

    However, in the practice of socialist construction, contradictions between the use value and value of commodities can also occur when the requirements of economic laws, especially the law of planned development of the national economy, are violated. This occurs, for example, when the leaders of individual enterprises, in order to pursue the completion of the plan in value terms, intensify the production of individual products that can increase the enterprise's income, rather than completing the production plan according to all varieties. But this contradiction is not antagonistic and can be resolved through planned leadership of the economy.

    In the socialist economy, there is a difference between complex (skilled) labor and simple labor, therefore, complex labor must be transformed into simple labor. When planning production, determining product quotas, planning wages (i.e., determining the remuneration for labor of various skill levels), etc., the comparative relationship between complex labor and simple labor must be taken into account.

    The amount of value of commodities produced and realized in the socialist economy is determined by the amount of socially necessary labor time expended in producing these commodities. The so-called socially necessary labor time is the average labor time expended by those enterprises that produce the majority of products in a certain sector. The socially necessary labor time expended in producing a unit of commodity determines the social value of the commodity. The time actually expended in producing a unit of commodity in each enterprise is the individual labor time, which constitutes the individual value of the commodities of each enterprise.

    The socially necessary time expended in producing commodities is an objectively existing quantity. Under the capitalist system, socially necessary time is formed spontaneously, behind the backs of commodity producers. In the socialist economy, the state, based on objective economic conditions and the requirements of socialist economic laws, makes plans to increase labor productivity and reduce product costs, and stipulates labor and material consumption quotas for each enterprise; thus, the state influences the amount of socially necessary time expended in producing commodities through planning, reducing it.

    An important means by which the socialist state influences the amount of socially necessary time is the advanced labor and material consumption quotas stipulated based on the experience of advanced enterprises. Advanced quotas are the quotas that should be achieved in production during the planning period. It is lower than the level of labor and material consumption per unit of product that has already been achieved in practice. Advanced quotas have a huge mobilizing effect because they stimulate economic leaders and the labor masses to find shortcuts, rationalize production, adopt advanced technology, increase labor productivity, and reduce product costs. When advanced quotas are reached by most enterprises that produce the largest part of the product, it begins to coincide with the amount of socially necessary labor consumption and is no longer an advanced quota. On the other hand, during this period, advanced enterprises are constantly reducing the labor consumption of producing products. Based on the experience of advanced enterprises, new advanced labor consumption quotas are stipulated, and the realization of these quotas leads to a reduction in socially necessary time.

    Under the capitalist system, the contradiction between individual labor time and socially necessary labor time has an antagonistic nature. Enterprises that use higher technology and thus obtain excess profits keep their technological improvements secret, attacking competitors and causing them to go bankrupt and perish. In the socialist economy, the contradiction between socially necessary time and the individual time consumed in individual enterprises is not antagonistic. The socialist economy does not have so-called "trade secrets" because the technological achievements of advanced enterprises quickly become the property of all enterprises in that sector, guaranteeing the high tide of the entire socialist economy. All this accelerates technological innovation and promotes the rapid growth of the productive forces of socialist society.

The Nature of the Role of the Law of Value under the Socialist System

    Since commodity production and commodity circulation exist under the socialist system, the law of value continues to play a role.

    The socialist economic system strictly limits the role of the law of value to a certain range. The public ownership of the means of production in urban and rural areas, the narrowing of the scope of commodity production and commodity circulation, and the role of socialist economic laws, first and foremost the law of planned development of the national economy, all limit the role of the law of value. Under the socialist system, the scope of the law of value is also restricted by annual plans and five-year plans, as well as the entire economic activity of the socialist state. Therefore, under the socialist system, the law of value cannot play the role of regulator of production.

    If the law of value played the role of regulator of production under the socialist system, then in socialist society, the most profitable sectors and enterprises would be developed first, and heavy industrial enterprises that are very important from the perspective of the national economy but are temporarily unprofitable would be closed. But in the Soviet Union, enterprises that are initially unprofitable or less profitable but needed by the national economy will never be closed; on the contrary, they must be preserved and supported, while measures are taken to enable them to become profitable. The socialist state can use the income obtained from other sectors and enterprises to make up for the temporary losses of certain sectors or enterprises.

    The socialist state establishes enterprises and creates entire production sectors not to pursue profits, but with the requirements of the basic socialist economic law and the law of planned development of the national economy as its guide.

    Under the socialist system, the scope of the role of the law of value primarily includes commodity circulation, including commodity exchange—mainly the exchange of personal consumer goods. In this field, the law of value maintains a regulatory role within a certain restricted scope.

    The regulatory role of the law of value in the field of commodity circulation is manifested in the fact that when the state stipulates certain price ratios for various personal consumer goods, it takes into account both their value expressed in monetary terms and the supply and demand of these commodities. Ignoring the state of supply and demand will cause the demand for commodities with excessively high prices to decrease sharply, and the demand for commodities with excessively low prices to increase artificially. The regulatory role of the law of value is most evident in the collective farm market, where prices are formed on the basis of supply and demand, and price changes affect the scale and structure of commodity circulation in the collective farm market. However, the socialist state has a huge economic influence on the collective farm market because most commodities are sold in state-owned and cooperative commercial systems at fixed planned prices.

    The role of the law of value is not limited to the scope of commodity circulation. The law of value also affects socialist production, but this influence is not decisive.

    "The problem is that the consumer goods necessary to compensate for the consumption of labor power in the production process are produced and sold in our country as commodities affected by the law of value. It is precisely here that the influence of the law of value on production can be seen. Therefore, in our enterprises, such issues as economic accounting and profit issues, cost issues, price issues, etc., have practical significance. Therefore, our enterprises cannot and should not fail to take into account the law of value." [2]

    Since personal consumer goods are commodities, they have value. The value of industrial consumer goods includes the value of raw materials produced by collective farms as commodities. The newly created value of consumer goods is partly used to offset the consumption of monetary wages, and the other part constitutes the enterprise's income in monetary form. At the same time, non-commodity means of labor are worn out in the process of producing industrial consumer goods: machine tools, machines, factories. Since all other factors included in industrial consumer goods have a monetary form, the means of labor should also be accounted for in monetary terms.

    The influence of the law of value on the production of means of production is realized through the consumer goods necessary to compensate for the consumption of labor power. Since consumer goods are commodities, workers can only purchase them with money, that is, with monetary wages. Therefore, it is necessary to use monetary forms to calculate all other factors in the production of means of production, which together with wages constitute the cost of industrial products.

    Since consumer goods, as commodities, have value, then means of production, which are not commodities, have the form of commodities and value, which is used for cost accounting, calculation, and supervision.

    Under the capitalist system, the law of value plays a role as a spontaneous force ruling people. In contrast, in the socialist economy, the role of the law of value has been recognized, estimated, and utilized by the state in the practice of planned management of the national economy. Recognizing the role of the law of value and being good at utilizing it helps economic workers to lead production rationally, continuously improve working methods, realize economic accounting, and discover and utilize potential to increase output.

    The socialist state takes the law of value into account when planning prices. In the socialist economy, price is the monetary expression of the planned value of commodities. When planning the prices of means of production produced in the planned state-owned economy, only the value form is used, and the purpose is to use money to calculate the social labor consumed in producing them. The state stipulates prices based on social production costs; in the sectors producing commodities, social production costs are the value of these commodities.

    Having an economic basis for planned prices is of great significance for the development of the national economy.

    "The price issue is intertwined with all the major economic issues of the Soviet state and therefore also with political issues. The issue of establishing correct mutual relations between the peasant and working classes, the issue of ensuring the interconnection and mutual restriction of agriculture and industry...the issue of ensuring real wages and consolidating the chervonets [3]...all of these touch on the price issue." [4]

    In order to stipulate the correct price ratios for various commodities and materially stimulate the production of these commodities, the role of the law of value must be estimated. For example, the same purchase price must never be stipulated for a ton of cotton and a ton of grain without considering that the value of cotton is much higher than the value of grain. On the other hand, grain prices must never be stipulated too low, because this will prevent collective farms and farmers from being concerned about grain production from a material interest, and the development of the grain industry will be harmed.

    For example, the economically based purchase prices stipulated for cotton, wool, sugar beet, and other agricultural products have promoted the increase in the production of these products. Conversely, excessively low purchase prices and procurement prices for potatoes, vegetables, milk, meat, and grain have hindered the production of these products. The significant increase in the purchase prices and procurement prices of these products in 1953 based on the decisions of the USSR Council of Ministers and the Central Committee of the CPSU was a very important stimulus for increasing the production of these products.

    But the law of value is not the regulator of state prices; it is only one of the factors affecting this price. There is no phenomenon of "free play" of prices in the commodity circulation of the state and cooperatives. The commodity prices stipulated by the socialist state have certain differences from social production costs and commodity value. At the same time, what the socialist state is based on is first and foremost the requirements of the basic socialist economic law, and the necessity of ensuring the continuous growth of production on a high technical basis and meeting the growing needs of the entire society. The state uses the price mechanism to stipulate the proportion of the distribution of means of production among various sectors, which is determined by the requirements of the planned development of the national economy.

    For example, the state uses a considerable price policy to use part of the income created by some sectors to rapidly develop other sectors that are less profitable but have great national economic significance. The state stipulates lower prices for the means of production to encourage the adoption of advanced technology in state-owned industrial enterprises, and at the same time equips collective farm production with advanced technology through agricultural machinery stations. The state stipulates prices based on the need to ensure a certain income (profit) for enterprises, and at the same time estimates the quantity of certain commodities and their significance in the economy. The state uses prices to stimulate the production of certain products and regulate the demand for them. The Soviet state has consistently implemented a policy of lowering consumer goods prices to improve the people's welfare.

    Due to the various restrictions mentioned above, the role of the law of value under the socialist system does not bring about crises, unemployment, destruction of productive forces, and other devastating consequences, which, under capitalist conditions, are inevitable companions of this law. Precisely because of this, despite the continuous and vigorous development of socialist production, the law of value in the Soviet Union does not lead to crises of overproduction, but under the capitalist system, despite the very low rate of production development in capitalist countries, the law of value leads to periodic crises of overproduction.

Money and its Functions in the Socialist Economy

    Since commodity production and commodity circulation exist in socialist society, then money is necessary. "Even before the socialist revolution, socialists said that money could not be abolished at once... To eliminate money, many technical achievements are needed, and organizational achievements are much more difficult and important." "To eliminate money, it is necessary to establish a product distribution organization for hundreds of millions of people—this will take many years." [5]

    Money belongs to such an economic category that it retains its old form but fundamentally changes its nature to suit the needs of socialist economic development. Under the capitalist system, money becomes capital and becomes a means of seizing the unpaid labor of others, but in the socialist economy, money is a tool for economic construction for the benefit of the people, an economic tool for planning the national economy, and a means of calculating and supervising commodity production and commodity circulation.

    In the socialist economy, the content and mission of the function of money have undergone fundamental changes compared with the function of money under the capitalist system.

    Money first performs the function of a measure of the value of commodities, that is, it serves as a measure of the social labor embodied in commodities. Although the means of production are not commodities, they retain the form of commodities and value, so when money performs the function of measuring value, it is also a means of calculating the social labor consumed in the means of production. Under socialist conditions, in the case of the existence of the two basic forms of socialist production, the summary of the economic activities of enterprises, the comparison of the work results of enterprises and departments producing various products, the quantity of products in various departments of the national economy and the entire national economy can only be expressed in monetary form. Everyone knows that only a monetary commodity that has value in itself can perform the function of measuring value. Gold is this monetary commodity. In the Soviet Union and other countries of the socialist camp, currency has a gold content, which is a measure of value.

    Starting from gold as the general equivalent, the Soviet state stipulated the gold content of the ruble when implementing currency reform from 1922 to 1924. Later, the gold content of the ruble was determined indirectly, initially by converting according to the exchange rate of the Soviet ruble against the franc, and later changed to converting according to the exchange rate of the Soviet ruble against the US dollar. In 1950, due to the increase in the purchasing power of the ruble and the decrease in the purchasing power of the US dollar and the currencies of other capitalist countries, the Soviet state directly stipulated the gold content of the ruble as 0.222168 grams of gold. Based on the gold content of the ruble, the exchange rate of the ruble against foreign currencies was increased.

    Under the capitalist system, the function of measuring value, that is, the calculation of social labor, is realized behind the backs of commodity producers through spontaneous fluctuations in market prices, but in the socialist economy, money as a measure of value is used by the state as a means of calculation and cost accounting to determine the profits and losses of enterprises, etc.

    The Soviet state uses monetary calculation as a means of planning leadership and supervising the production process. For example, comparing the planned cost of a product with the actual cost can reveal the reasons why the actual cost exceeds the planned cost, and find ways to reduce costs and increase the profitability of the enterprise.

    The socialist state utilizes the function of money as a measure of value when planning prices.

    In the socialist economy, money is also the standard of price. In the Soviet Union, the standard of price is the ruble.

    Under the socialist system, money performs the function of means of circulation of commodities. Money, as a means of circulation, plays a role when residents purchase personal consumer goods and collective farms and farmers sell their products. Money as a means of circulation is used to expand commodity turnover.

    In the socialist economy, money performs the function of means of payment. Money, as a means of payment, plays a role when paying workers' wages, socialist enterprises receiving and repaying loans, paying taxes, etc. The socialist state uses the function of money as a means of payment to supervise the activities of socialist enterprises. For example, banks provide monetary funds to enterprises based on the completion of the production plan. The bank requires timely repayment of loans, which also promotes enterprises to complete the plan, because enterprises that do not complete the plan cannot accumulate the monetary funds necessary to repay loans, etc. Under the socialist system, money performs the function of means of socialist accumulation and savings. State-owned enterprises and collective farms deposit monetary funds in banks. The monetary income of enterprises and organizations and temporarily idle monetary funds are used for the needs of socialist accumulation, used to expand production, form reserves, and serve the material and cultural needs of residents. Due to the improvement of the welfare of workers, their monetary savings are increasing day by day. These savings are deposited in savings banks.

    In socialist society, gold has the functions of hoarding and world currency. Gold reserves are mainly the state's world currency reserve fund. Gold is the state's means of international settlement in the field of foreign trade.

    The stability of the Soviet currency is not only guaranteed by gold reserves but primarily by the large number of commodities concentrated in the hands of the state and put into commodity circulation at fixed planned prices. In any capitalist country, money does not have such a reliable guarantee as the Soviet state.

Brief Conclusions

    (1) Under the socialist system, the necessity of commodity production is determined by the existence of two basic forms of socialist production: the state form and the collective farm form. Commodity production and commodity circulation are mainly limited to personal consumer goods. Commodity production in socialist society is a special kind of commodity production without private ownership of the means of production and without the participation of capitalists. It serves socialist society.

    (2) In the socialist economy, commodities have both use value created by concrete labor and value created by abstract labor. Socialist society does not have contradictions between private labor and social labor. Socialist labor has direct sociality. In the socialist economy, creating use value and improving product quality are of great significance. At the same time, the value of commodities is continuously reduced on the basis of planned reduction of the socially necessary time expended in producing commodities.

    (3) Under the socialist system, the scope of the role of the law of value is limited. The law of value is not the regulator of production, but it affects production through the consumer goods necessary to compensate for the consumption of labor power in the production process. The law of value is utilized in the planned leadership of the national economy. The role of the law of value is taken into account when planning prices.

    (4) In the socialist economy, money is an economic tool used to plan the national economy, and is used as a tool to calculate and supervise commodity production and commodity circulation. Money performs the functions of measure of value, means of circulation, means of payment, and means of socialist accumulation and savings. Soviet currency is not only guaranteed by gold reserves but primarily by the large number of commodities concentrated in the hands of the state and sold at state-planned prices.

    社会主义制度下的商品生产、价值法则和货币
    ——“政治经济学教科书”第三十一章
    社会主义制度下商品生产的必要性及其特点
    社会主义制度下商品生产的必要性，是由社会主义生产的两种基本形式——国家的形式和集体农庄的形式——的存在而产生的。在国营企业中，生产资料和产品是全民的财产。在集体农庄中，生产资料（耕畜和食用牲畜，农具，农庄建筑物等等）和集体农庄生产的产品是集团的、合作社集体农庄的财产。基本的和决定性的农业生产资料（土地和农业机器站的机器）为国家所有。既然国营企业的产品属于社会主义国家，而集体农庄的产品属于集体农庄，通过买卖的交换也就成为工业和农业间的经济联系的必要形式。在这里，也同任何买卖一样，商品持有者失去商品的所有权，而买主则变成这一商品的所有者。
    列宁指出“用大规模的（‘社会主义化的’）工业的产品来交换农民的产品，这就是社会主义的经济实质”〔一〕，同时指出商品交换是对工业和农业间的相互关系正确与否的检验。列宁的这些原理对于整个共产主义第一阶段都是适用的。苏维埃国家主要是从集体农庄和庄员那里，用收购和采购的方法，为城市居民取得粮食，为工业取得原料。而集体农庄和庄员也只有把自己的商品卖给国家和合作社，或者拿到集体农庄市场出售，才能获得换取工业品所必需的货币资金。
    因此，通过收购和采购而从集体农庄转到国家和合作社手中的农产品和原料，以及在集体农庄市场上出售的农产品，都是商品。国营企业生产的、集体农庄和庄员所购买的工业品（主要是个人消费品）也是商品。既然个人消费品是商品，它们也就通过买卖转入城市居民手中。
    社会主义制度下的商品生产不是通常的商品生产，而是特种的商品生产。这是没有生产资料私有制、没有资本家参加的商品生产。它基本上是由联合的社会主义生产者（国家、集体农庄、合作社）进行的。由于生产资料公有制的建立、雇佣劳动制度和人剥削人的现象的消灭等决定性的经济条件，社会主义制度下的商品生产是受到一定限制的。因此，它不可能变为资本主义生产，它是为社会主义社会服务的。
    社会主义社会中的商品生产不像资本主义制度下那样漫无限制和包罗一切。在社会主义制度下，商品生产和商品流通的范围，主要限于个人消费品。在社会主义社会中，劳动力不是商品。土地、矿藏是国家的财产，不能是买卖或出租的对象。国营企业——工厂、矿井、电力站及其固定生产基金（生产工具、房屋、建筑物等等）——不能买卖，只能经过特别的许可由一个国家机关交给另一个国家机关，因而不是商品，不是买卖对象。
    国营经济中生产的生产资料——机器、机床、金属、煤、石油等等——在国营企业间进行分配。在国民经济计划中规定，按照每一企业的生产计划拨给该企业一定的物资。这些物资根据彼此订立的合同由生产此种物资的企业供给消费此种物资的企业。当生产资料转入某一企业手中时，社会主义国家完全保持对这些生产资料的所有权。企业经理从社会主义国家取得生产资料，决不能变成它们的所有者，他只是按照国家计划来利用生产资料的国家代表。集体农庄购买汽车、自己的公共经济所需的设备、最简单的农业机器和农具。但是基本的农业机器——拖拉机、联合收割机等等——并不卖给集体农庄，而集中在国营企业即农业机器站，农业机器站就用这些生产资料来为集体农庄服务。在国内各国营企业间进行分配的生产资料，实质上不是商品。但是它们保存着商品的形式，具有价格，这是进行计算和成本核算所必需的。
    在对外贸易领域内，售给外国的生产资料是商品。在这里有买卖行为，商品所有者是有改变的。
      社会主义经济中的商品的使用价值和价值
    在社会主义社会中，作为商品来生产和实现的那些产品，具有由具体劳动创造的使用价值和由抽象劳动创造的价值。换句话说，在社会主义制度下，商品具有二重性，这是由生产商品的劳动的二重性决定的。
    社会主义制度下的劳动的二重性，根本不同于简单商品经济和资本主义经济中的劳动的二重性。在以私有制为基础的商品生产的条件下，生产商品的劳动的二重性反映着私人劳动和社会劳动之间的矛盾。社会主义经济没有这种矛盾。如上所说，在社会主义经济中，劳动不是私人劳动，而是直接的社会劳动。社会预先计划着工作者在生产过程中的劳动。国民经济各部门间和各企业间的劳动分配是有计划的。因此，在社会主义经济中，商品拜物教消灭了，人与人的社会关系没有物与物的关系的虚假外表。
    但是，在社会主义制度下，国营企业（在这里，劳动已在全民范围内社会化）中的直接的社会劳动和集体农庄（在这里，劳动只是在该一农业劳动组合的范围内社会化）中的直接的社会劳动是有区别的。此外，集体农庄庄员也在具有从属意义的个人副业中使用自己的劳动。由于劳动社会化程度的这种差别，由于国营工业和集体农庄间的商品联系的存在，没有可能直接用劳动时间来表现和比较用于工业品生产和集体农庄产品生产的社会劳动。因此，必须利用价值和价值形式来间接地较量社会劳动。这种较量是靠通过商品交换把工人和集体农庄庄员的各种具体劳动化为创造商品价值的抽象劳动。
    社会主义国家在对国民经济进行计划领导的过程中，估计到商品的使用价值和价值两方面。国家要求自己的企业生产某种产品即某种使用价值。资本家对使用价值感兴趣，只因为它是价值和剩余价值的承担者，而在社会主义经济中，创造使用价值和提高产品质量却有极重要的意义，因为进行生产是为了最充分地满足整个社会日益增长的需要的。
    在社会主义经济中，商品价值也有重大的意义。国家计划生产不仅用实物指标，也用货币指标。同时，不断降低所生产的商品的价值并在这个基础上降低价格，对于保证最大限度地满足社会的需要有很大的作用。
    在社会主义经济中，包含着生产过剩危机的可能性的使用价值和价值间的对抗性矛盾是不存在的。社会主义经济保证有完全可能在货币表现和实物表现上完成产品生产计划。
    但是在社会主义建设的实际中，当违反了经济法则尤其是国民经济有计划的发展法则的要求的时候，商品的使用价值和价值间的矛盾也会发生。例如当个别企业的领导者为了追求在价值上完成计划，加紧生产更能增加企业收入的个别产品，而不按所有品种完成生产计划时，就会出现这种情况。但是这种矛盾不是对抗性的，通过对经济的计划领导就可解决。
    在社会主义经济中存在着复杂（熟练）劳动和简单劳动间的差别，因此，复杂劳动就要化为简单劳动。在计划生产、确定产品定额、计划工资（即确定各种不同熟练程度的劳动的报酬）等等时，要估计到复杂劳动和简单劳动间的对比关系。
    在社会主义经济中生产的和实现的商品的价值量，是由生产这些商品所耗费的社会必要劳动时间量来决定的。所谓社会必要劳动时间就是生产某一部门大部分产品的那些企业所耗费的平均劳动时间。生产单位商品所耗费的社会必要劳动时间决定商品的社会价值。各个企业中生产单位商品所实际耗费的时间是个别劳动时间，它组成这些企业中每个企业的商品的个别价值。
    生产商品所耗费的社会必要时间是一个客观存在的量。在资本主义制度下，社会必要时间是自发地、背着商品生产者形成的。在社会主义经济中，国家根据客观经济条件和社会主义经济法则的要求，做出提高劳动生产率和降低产品成本的计划，规定各企业的劳动和材料消耗定额；从而国家通过计划去影响生产商品所耗费的社会必要时间量，使它降低。
    社会主义国家通过计划去影响社会必要时间量的重要手段，是根据先进企业的经验规定的先进的劳动和材料消耗定额。先进定额是计划时期内在生产中应该达到的定额。它低于事实上已经达到的单位产品的劳动和材料消耗水平。先进定额具有巨大的动员作用，因为它激发经济领导者和劳动群众去寻找窍门，使生产合理化，采用先进技术，提高劳动生产率和降低产品成本。当先进定额经生产最大部分产品的大多数企业达到后，它就开始和社会必要劳动消耗量一致，不再是先进的定额。另一方面，在这段时间中，先进企业在不断降低生产产品的劳动消耗量。根据先进企业的经验，又规定新的先进的劳动消耗定额，而这种定额的实现又引起社会必要时间的减少。
    在资本主义制度下，个别劳动时间和社会必要劳动时间之间的矛盾具有对抗的性质。运用较高技术因而获得超额利润的企业对自己的技术改进保守秘密，打击竞争者，使他们破产和灭亡。在社会主义经济中，社会必要时间和个别企业中所消耗的个别时间之间的矛盾不是对抗的。社会主义经济没有所谓“商业秘密”，因为先进企业的技术成就很快成为该一部门所有企业的财产，保证着整个社会主义经济的高涨。这一切就加速技术革新，并促进社会主义社会的生产力的迅速增长。
    社会主义制度下价值法则作用的性质
    既然在社会主义制度下存在着商品生产和商品流通，价值法则也就继续发生作用。
    社会主义经济制度把价值法则的作用严格地限制在一定的范围内。城乡生产资料的公有化，商品生产和商品流通范围的缩小，以及社会主义经济法则首先是国民经济有计划的发展法则的作用，这一切都限制了价值法则的作用。在社会主义制度下，价值法则的作用范围也受年度计划和五年计划以及社会主义国家的整个经济活动的限制。因此，在社会主义制度下，价值法则不能起生产调节者的作用。
    假如在社会主义制度下价值法则起生产调节者的作用，那末，在社会主义社会中就会首先发展最能赢利的部门和企业，就会关闭从国民经济利益来看是很重要的、可是暂时不能赢利的重工业企业。但是在苏联决不会关闭最初不能赢利或赢利较少的、为国民经济所需要的企业，相反地，要保存和支持它们，同时采取办法使它们能够赢利。社会主义国家可以用其他部门和企业取得的收入来弥补某些部门或企业的暂时的亏损。
    社会主义国家建立企业和创立整个生产部门，不是为了追逐利润，而是以社会主义基本经济法则和国民经济有计划的发展法则的要求为指针的。
    在社会主义制度下，价值法则的作用范围首先包括商品流通，包括商品交换——主要是个人消费品的交换。在这个领域中，价值法则是在一定的受限制的范围内保持着调节者的作用的。
    价值法则在商品流通领域中的调节作用，表现在国家规定各种个人消费品的一定比价时，既考虑到它们以货币表现出来的价值，也考虑到这些商品的需求和供给。忽略需求和供给的状况就会使价格过高的商品的需求锐减，使价格过低的商品的需求人为地增大。价值法则的调节作用在集体农庄市场上表现得最明显，在那里，价格是在需求和供给的基础上形成的，而且价格的变动影响集体农庄市场的商品流转的规模和结构。但是社会主义国家对集体农庄市场有巨大的经济影响，因为大部分商品是在国营和合作社营商业系统中按固定计划价格出售的。
    价值法则的作用并不限于商品流通范围。价值法则对社会主义生产也发生影响，但这种影响不是决定性的。
      “问题在于，为了抵偿生产过程中劳动力的耗费所必需的消费品，在我国是作为受价值法则影响的商品来生产和销售的。也正是在这里可以看出价值法则对生产的影响。因此，在我们的企业中，这样一些问题，如经济核算和赢利问题、成本问题、价格问题等等，就具有现实的意义。所以，我们的企业是不能不而且不应该不考虑到价值法则的。”〔二〕
    个人消费品既是商品，就有价值。工业消费品的价值包括集体农庄作为商品来生产的原料的价值。消费品的新创造的价值，一部分用来抵偿货币工资的消耗，另一部分则构成货币形式的企业收入。同时，在工业消费品的生产过程中还要磨损非商品的劳动资料：机床、机器、厂房。既然包括在工业消费品中的一切其他因素都具有货币形式，劳动资料也就应该以货币来进行成本核算。
    价值法则对生产资料生产的影响是通过抵偿劳动力的消耗所必需的消费品而实现的。消费品既然是商品，工人就只能用货币即用货币工资去购买。因此，必须在生产资料的生产中利用货币形式来计算一切其他因素，这些因素和工资一起构成工业品的成本。
    既然作为商品的消费品具有价值，那末不是商品的生产资料就具有商品和价值的形式，这种形式是用来进行成本核算、计算和监督的。
    在资本主义制度下，价值法则是作为统治着人们的自发力量而起作用的，与此相反，在社会主义经济中，价值法则的作用已为国家在国民经济计划管理的实践中所认识、估计和利用。认识价值法则的作用并善于利用它，有助于经济工作人员合理地领导生产，不断地改进工作方法，实现经济核算，发现和利用潜力来提高产量。
    社会主义国家在计划价格时考虑到价值法则。在社会主义经济中，价格是按计划规定的商品价值的货币表现。在计划国营经济所生产的生产资料的价格时，所利用的只是价值形式，其目的在用货币来计算生产它们所消耗的社会劳动。国家规定价格以社会生产费用为出发点，在生产商品的部门中，社会生产费用就是这些商品的价值。
    计划价格时要有经济上的根据，这个问题对于国民经济的发展具有重要的意义。
    “价格问题是同苏维埃国家的一切主要经济问题因而也同政治问题交错在一起的。建立农民和工人阶级的正确的相互关系问题，保证农业和工业的相互联系和相互制约的发展的问题……保证实际工资和巩固切尔文〔三〕的问题……这一切都碰到价格问题。”〔四〕
    为了规定各种商品的正确比价和从物质上刺激这些商品的生产，必须估计到价值法则的作用。例如决不能对一吨棉花和一吨粮食规定同样的收购价格，而不考虑棉花的价值大大高过粮食的价值。另一方面，决不能把粮价规定得过低，因为这会使集体农庄和庄员不能从物质利益上关心谷物的生产，而使谷物业的发展受到损害。
    例如给棉花、羊毛、甜菜和其他农产品规定的有经济根据的收购价格，促进了这些产品的生产的增加。相反地，马铃薯、蔬菜、乳类、肉类和粮食的过低的收购价格和采购价格，阻碍了这些产品的生产。一九五三年根据苏联部长会议和苏共中央的决议大大提高了这些产品的收购价格和采购价格，这对于增加这些产品的生产是一个很重要的刺激。
    但是价值法则不是国家价格的调节者，它只是影响这种价格的因素之一。在国家和合作社的商品流转中没有“自由玩弄”价格的现象。社会主义国家规定的商品价格，是和社会生产费用、商品价值有某些差别的。同时，社会主义国家所根据的首先是社会主义基本经济法则的要求，是保证生产在高度技术基础上不断增长和满足整个社会日益增长的需要的必要性。国家利用价格机构规定各部门间生产资料分配的比例，这种比例是由国民经济有计划的发展的要求来决定的。
    例如国家利用相当的价格政策，把一些部门创造的收入的一部分，用来迅速发展另一些赢利较少但有很大国民经济意义的部门。国家规定较低的生产资料价格，鼓励在国营工业企业中采用先进技术，同时通过农业机器站以高度技术装备集体农庄生产。国家规定价格是从保证企业一定的收益（赢利）的必要性出发的，同时估计到某些商品的数量及其在经济中的意义。国家利用价格来刺激某些产品的生产，调节对它们的需求。苏维埃国家一贯实行降低消费品价格的政策以增进人民的福利。
    价值法则由于受到上述各种限制，它在社会主义制度下的作用并不带来危机、失业、生产力的破坏等等毁灭性的后果，而在资本主义条件下，它们却是这一法则的必然的旅伴。正由于这一点，尽管社会主义生产不断地蓬勃地发展，价值法则在苏联并不导致生产过剩的危机，可是在资本主义制度下，尽管资本主义国家的生产发展速度很低，价值法则却导致周期性的生产过剩的危机。
    社会主义经济中的货币及其职能
    既然在社会主义社会中存在着商品生产和商品流通，那末货币就是必需的。“还在社会主义革命以前，社会主义者就说过，货币是不能一下子就废除的……为了消灭货币，需要很多技术上的成就，而困难得多和重要得多的是组织上的成就。”“为了消灭货币，必须建立亿万人的产品分配组织，——这是很多年的事情。”〔五〕
    货币属于这样的经济范畴，它保留旧形式而根本改变自己的本性以适合于社会主义经济发展的需要。在资本主义制度下，货币变为资本，成为攫取他人无酬劳动的手段，在社会主义经济中却不同，货币是为人民群众谋福利的经济建设的工具，是用来计划国民经济的经济工具，是计算和监督商品生产和商品流通的手段。
    在社会主义经济中，货币职能的内容和使命同资本主义制度下的货币职能比起来，已经发生根本的变化。
    货币首先执行商品价值尺度的职能，就是说，充当体现在商品中的社会劳动的尺度。生产资料虽然不是商品，但保留着商品和价值的形式，所以货币在执行价值尺度的职能时，同样是计算消耗在生产资料上的社会劳动的手段。在社会主义条件下，在社会主义生产的两种基本形式存在的情况下，企业的经济活动的总结，生产各种产品的企业和部门的工作成果的比较，国民经济各部门和整个国民经济的产品数量，都只能以货币形式来表现。大家知道，只有本身具有价值的货币商品才能执行价值尺度的职能。黄金就是这种货币商品。在苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家中，货币有含金量，它是价值尺度。
    从黄金充当一般等价物出发，苏维埃国家在一九二二年至一九二四年实行币制改革时规定了卢布的含金量。后来，卢布的含金量是间接地确定的，起先是按苏联卢布对法郎的兑换率折算，以后改为按苏联卢布对美元的兑换率折算。一九五○年，由于卢布的购买力提高，美元和其他资本主义国家货币的购买力下降，苏维埃国家直接规定卢布的含金量为○·二二二一六八公分黄金。根据卢布的含金量提高了卢布对外币的兑换率。
    在资本主义制度下，价值尺度的职能即社会劳动的计算，是背着商品生产者通过市场价格的自发波动实现的，而在社会主义经济中，货币作为价值尺度是被国家当做计算和成本核算的手段有计划地用来确定企业的盈亏等等的。
    苏维埃国家把货币计算当做进行计划领导和监督生产进程的手段。例如把产品的计划成本和实际成本加以比较，就能发现实际成本超出计划成本的原因，找出降低成本和提高企业赢利的办法。
    社会主义国家在计划价格时是利用货币的价值尺度的职能的。
    在社会主义经济中，货币也是价格标准。在苏联，价格标准是卢布。
    在社会主义制度下，货币执行商品的流通手段的职能。货币作为流通手段，是在居民购买个人消费品和集体农庄及庄员出售自己产品的时候起作用的。货币作为流通手段是用来扩大商品流转的。
    在社会主义经济中，货币执行支付手段的职能。货币作为支付手段，是在支付职工的工资、社会主义企业领取和偿还贷款、纳税等等时候起作用的。社会主义国家利用货币的支付手段的职能来监督社会主义企业的活动。例如银行根据企业完成生产计划的情况对企业发放货币资金。银行要求及时偿还贷款，也就推动企业完成计划，因为企业不完成计划就不能积下偿还贷款等等所必需的货币资金。　　在社会主义制度下，货币执行社会主义积累和储蓄的手段的职能。国营企业和集体农庄把货币资金存入银行。企业和组织的货币收入和暂时闲置的货币资金，被用于社会主义积累的需要，被用来扩大生产、形成后备和为居民的物质和文化需要服务。由于劳动者的福利的提高，他们的货币积蓄日益增多。这些积蓄存于储蓄银行。
    在社会主义社会中，黄金具有贮藏和世界货币的职能。黄金储备主要是国家的世界货币准备基金。黄金是国家在对外贸易领域中进行国际结算的手段。
    苏联货币的稳定性不仅由黄金储备来保证，首先是由集中在国家手中的、按固定计划价格投入商品流转中的大量商品来保证的。在任何一个资本主义国家中，货币都没有苏维埃国家这样可靠的保证。
    简短的结论
      （一）在社会主义制度下，商品生产的必要性是由社会主义生产的两种基本形式——国家的形式和集体农庄的形式——的存在而决定的。商品生产和商品流通主要限于个人消费品。社会主义社会中的商品生产是没有生产资料私有制、没有资本家参加的特种的商品生产。它是为社会主义社会服务的。
    （二）在社会主义经济中，商品具有由具体劳动创造的使用价值和由抽象劳动创造的价值。社会主义社会没有私人劳动和社会劳动间的矛盾。社会主义劳动具有直接的社会性。在社会主义经济中，创造使用价值和改进产品质量具有极重要的意义。同时，在有计划地缩减生产商品所耗费的社会必要时间的基础上，不断减低商品价值。
    （三）在社会主义制度下，价值法则的作用范围是受到限制的。价值法则不是生产的调节者，但它通过抵偿生产过程中劳动力的耗费所必需的消费品来影响生产。在对国民经济进行计划领导的过程中是利用价值法则的。在计划价格时是考虑到价值法则的作用的。
    （四）在社会主义经济中，货币是用来计划国民经济的经济工具，用做计算和监督商品生产和商品流通的工具。货币执行价值尺度、流通手段、支付手段、社会主义积累和储蓄的手段的职能。苏维埃货币不仅由黄金储备来保证，首先是由集中在国家手中的、按国家计划价格出售的大量商品来保证的。
