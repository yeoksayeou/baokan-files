Agricultural Production Cooperative Accountant Training Classes Held in Various Locations

[Dispatch from this newspaper] With the development of agricultural production cooperatives, agricultural production cooperative accountant training classes have been held in various places. According to incomplete statistics from fourteen provinces, including Shanxi, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Liaoning, Shaanxi, and Sichuan, as of mid-January of this year, a total of more than 270,000 accountants have been trained or are currently being trained.

The accountant training classes in various places, mostly targeting the students' underestimation of accounting work and their fear of its difficulty, had responsible comrades make political mobilization reports to raise the students' ideological awareness and strengthen their confidence and determination to do a good job in agricultural production cooperative accounting. After training, the students initially learned accounting procedures and some accounting business knowledge. For example, in the accountant training class held in Shanghe County, Shandong Province, in December of last year, after systematic study of accounting business, 372 out of 401 students basically learned how to set up and keep accounts, of which 180 were relatively familiar with accounting subjects and could set up accounts independently, and 192 had a poorer understanding of accounting subjects but could set up accounts with a little help.

The accountant training classes in various places also studied the financial management system and distribution policies of agricultural production cooperatives in light of local actual conditions, and examined the phenomenon of unsound financial systems or lax implementation in agricultural production cooperatives. Most people realized the necessity of establishing a financial system. Many students said that after returning to the cooperative, they would establish financial systems such as expense approval, receipts, and public disclosure of accounts through democratic discussions, and suggested that the management committee adjust unreasonable aspects of distribution.

Many regions' training classes organized accountants from various cooperatives to establish accounting mutual aid groups, so that students could carry out mutual teaching and learning activities after returning to consolidate and improve the results of the training. For example, the first training class in Ningyang County, Shandong Province, established 19 accounting mutual aid groups before the end of the study and determined a system for contacting instructors.

Currently, some local leading cadres do not pay enough attention to this work. Some only assign a few accounting instructors to do it; some training times are too short, the teaching content is too heavy, and the students cannot digest it; some select students without enough caution, and incidents of impure elements and substitutes occur.

### 各地举办农业生产合作社会计员训练班

    各地举办农业生产合作社会计员训练班
      【本报讯】随着农业生产合作社的发展，各地相继举办了农业生产合作社会计员训练班。根据山西、河北、山东、河南、辽宁、陕西、四川等十四个省到今年一月中旬的不完全统计，已训练和正在训练的会计员共有二十七万多人。
    各地会计员训练班大都针对学员轻视会计工作和对会计工作的畏难心理，由负责同志作了政治动员报告，提高了学员们的思想觉悟，使学员们加强了做好农业生产合作社会计工作的信心和决心。经过训练，学员初步学会了账务处理办法和一些会计业务知识。如山东省商河县在去年十二月举办的会计员训练班，经过会计业务系统学习，四百零一个学员中，基本上学会建账记账的有三百七十二人，其中对会计科目较熟悉并能单独建账的有一百八十人，对会计科目学习较差但稍加帮助就能建账的有一百九十二人。
    各地会计员训练班还结合本地实际情况，学习了农业生产合作社的财务管理制度和分配政策上的问题，检查了农业生产合作社财务制度不健全或执行不严肃的现象。大部分人都认识到建立财务制度的必要性。许多学员表示回社后要通过民主讨论订立开支批审、单据、公布账目等财务制度，并建议管理委员会对分配中的不合理的地方进行调整。
    不少地区的训练班组织各社会计员建立了会计互助组，使学员们回去后能够开展互教互学的活动，巩固和提高训练的成果。如山东宁阳县第一期训练班在学习结束前，建立了十九个会计互助组，并确定了同辅导员联系的制度。
    目前，有些地区的领导干部对这一工作还不够重视。有的只交给几个会计辅导员去做；有的训练时间过短，教学内容分量过重，学员消化不了；有的选拔学员不够慎重，发生成份不纯和支差顶替现象。
