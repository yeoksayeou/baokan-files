Since the implementation of the planned supply of grain and cooking oil nationwide, the vast majority of government agencies, organizations, industrial and mining enterprises, schools, and other units have been able to strictly implement the state's policies regarding the planned supply of grain and cooking oil, formulating plans based on actual needs, and striving to conserve grain and cooking oil in various ways. These practical actions have set a good example among the people and have played a positive role in implementing the policies of the Party and the government. However, recently we have received letters from some readers reflecting that some units still violate the planned supply policy, falsely reporting the number of people to purchase more grain and oil. For example, the Eighth Engineering Company of Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, falsely reported 1,572 employees in the two months of October and November last year, purchasing 36,156 catties more of flour. In order to eat more rice, they falsely claimed that 29 engineers in the company were from the South and needed to eat rice, requesting the grain department to take care of them, purchasing 750 catties more of rice, but in reality, only four engineers were from the South. The Fujian Machinery Factory actually had a maximum of no more than 650 people eating in the factory each month, but they compiled a grain consumption plan for more than 780 people each month, falsely reporting 1,390 people in ten months, purchasing 61,300 catties more of grain. Furthermore, the Jiangsu Gaoyou Schistosomiasis Specialist Hospital had only 14 staff members, but they fabricated a plan out of thin air and purchased 281 catties of cooking oil at one time. Such violations of policy have also occurred in units responsible for planned supply. According to reader Zhang Yuepu, the Zibo Municipal People's Government Grain Bureau of Shandong Province falsely reported the number of people to purchase more grain in the three months of August, September, and October last year.

Some units, after falsely reporting the number of people to purchase more grain, also used incorrect methods to handle the surplus grain. The Yueyang Lukoupu Quarry often resells the grain purchased by falsely reporting the number of people to farmers. Last year, farmer Li Zhengkui of Zhongnong successively purchased more than 200 catties of machine-milled rice from the quarry. Wang Zhian of the tenth group of the quarry sold 50 catties of rice to farmer Li Baolin of Shishan Township for 1,200 yuan per catty, which was 270 yuan higher than the local grain company's listed price per catty. The Xiangtan Electrical Industry School in Hunan also once "borrowed" 4,322 catties of surplus flour and rice to the families of school faculty and staff in the name of "loans," and later paid back the money at a price. There are also many units that arbitrarily waste grain, creating a bad influence among the people.

The above-mentioned erroneous behaviors directly increase the difficulties for units responsible for planned supply, making it impossible to accurately formulate grain consumption plans. In order to correct this phenomenon, it is necessary to strictly enforce the planned supply system and conduct careful accounting of the grain needed by grain-consuming units. For units with a large floating population, registration procedures should be handled in a timely manner. In cases of job transfers, school holidays, and project completion, the number of grain-consuming people should be reduced in a timely manner in accordance with regulations. Leading comrades of government agencies, organizations, schools, industrial and mining enterprises, and other units in various regions should strictly review the grain demand plan of their respective units and earnestly abide by the state's policies regarding the planned supply of grain and cooking oil. All government agencies and organizations should strictly abide by the planned supply policy. For those who abuse certificates and falsely report the number of people, undermining the policy, a serious investigation should be conducted, and the perpetrators should be given the punishment they deserve.

### 纠正虚报人数多领粮食的错误

    纠正虚报人数多领粮食的错误
    全国实行粮食和食油的计划供应以来，绝大多数的机关、团体、工矿企业、学校等单位都能严格地执行国家关于粮食、食油计划供应的政策，根据实际需要编造计划，并且多方面设法节约粮食和食油。这些实际行动，在人民群众中树立了良好的榜样，对于贯彻党和政府的政策起了积极的作用。但是，最近我们接到一些读者来信反映，有些单位还有违反计划供应政策，虚报人数多购油粮的现象存在。例如，山西省太原市第八工程公司在去年十月和十一月两个月中就虚报职工一千五百七十二人，多购面粉三万六千一百五十六斤。他们为了多吃到一些大米，就假说公司里有二十九位工程师是南方人，需要吃大米，要求粮食部门给以照顾，多购了大米七百五十斤，但实际上只有四位工程师是南方人。福建机器厂每月实际在厂内吃饭的人数最多不超过六百五十人，他们每月却编造七百八十多人的用粮计划，十个月中虚报了一千三百九十人，多购粮食六万一千三百斤。又如，江苏高邮血吸虫专科医院只有十四个工作人员，他们凭空编造计划，一次就买了食油二百八十一斤。这种违犯政策的现象，在掌握计划供应的单位中也发生过。据读者张悦朴反映，山东淄博市人民政府粮食局在去年八、九、十等三个月中，都曾虚报人数多购粮食。
    有些单位在虚报人数多购粮食以后，还用错误的作法来处理余粮。岳阳路口铺采石场经常把虚报人数多购的粮食转卖给农民。去年，中农李政魁就先后从采石场买进了二百多斤机米。采石场的第十组王志安卖给石山乡农民李保林五十斤大米，每斤价一千二百元，比当地粮食公司的牌价每斤超出二百七十元。湖南湘潭电器工业学校也曾经把多余的面粉和大米四千三百二十二斤用“出借”的名义借给学校教职员家属，后来全部作价还钱。也有不少单位有任意浪费粮食的现象，在群众中造成了不好的影响。
    上述这些错误行为，直接给予掌握计划供应的单位增加了困难，不能精确地制定用粮计划。为了纠正这种现象，必须严格计划供应制度，对于用粮单位需要的粮食进行认真的核算；对于流动人口较多的单位，应及时办理报告登记手续。凡工作调动、学校放假、工地完工等情况，都要依照规定及时减少需粮人口的数字；各地机关、团体、学校、工矿企业等单位的领导同志应该严格审查本单位需用粮食的计划，切实遵守国家关于粮食和食油计划供应的政策。一切机关、团体都应该严格遵守计划供应政策。对于那种滥开证明，虚报人数的破坏政策现象，应当认真查究，给予违法人员以应得的处分。
