(Reported by our Shanghai correspondent on the 21st) The signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons in Shanghai has reached a climax. As of the 21st, the number of signatures has reached nearly four million. The signature campaign has expanded from factories, schools, government offices, and shops to residents in more than 11,000 alleys and lanes throughout the city and to farmers in the suburbs. More than 200,000 members of neighborhood residents' committees, residents' group leaders, and women representatives have been going deep into the masses for days to conduct propaganda, organize large and small signature rallies, or collect signatures separately. Tens of thousands of sailors, fishermen, aquatic residents, and stevedores on the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek signed their names on their ships, boats, and wharves. At the signature table at the North Railway Station, travelers signing their names also came in an endless stream all day long.
