	Significant Yield Increase from Trial Use of New Farm Tools

	The ten new-style animal-powered farm tool stations established on a trial basis in Shanxi Province last year played a demonstrative role for farmers in improving farming techniques and increasing production. The 130 agricultural production cooperatives and 18 mutual aid teams served by the ten stations last year used new-style animal-powered farm tools for cultivation, resulting in an average increase of twelve to fifteen jin of grain per mu. The farm tool stations also proved that the double-wheeled, double-furrow plow is suitable for the southern, central, and northern parts of Shanxi. In Changzi, southern Shanxi, the new-style animal-powered farm tool station used a double-wheeled, double-furrow plow to cultivate the land for the Xiao Guo Agricultural Production Cooperative, resulting in a yield of fourteen jin more millet per mu, sixteen jin more corn, and thirteen and four-tenths jin more wheat than the land tilled with old plows. The Sunjiazhai Cooperative in the suburbs of Taiyuan City, Jinzhong, used a double-wheeled, double-furrow plow to cultivate land, resulting in a yield of sixteen and nine-tenths jin more spring wheat per mu, sixty-three jin more millet, and fifty-three jin more sorghum than the land cultivated with old plows. In the Yanbei area, the Maxinzhuang Agricultural Production Cooperative in Datong used a double-wheeled, double-furrow plow to cultivate land, resulting in a yield of eighteen jin more naked oats per mu and thirteen and a half jin more millet than the land cultivated with old plows. During the use of the double-wheeled, double-furrow plow last year, the stations organized a total of more than 330,000 people to visit, which had a great impact. Many cooperatives have rationally planned the land because of the use of new-style animal-powered farm tools, such as Dalü Village in Xia County, which merged 572 pieces of land into more than 190 pieces, removed 375 field ridges and boundaries, and expanded the cultivated area by ten mu. Many mutual aid teams, in order to strive for the use of new farm tools, transformed into agricultural production cooperatives last winter.

	At present, farmers in various places are urgently demanding new-style animal-powered farm tools, and have already pre-ordered more than 2,000 units from supply and marketing cooperatives. Shanxi Province plans to promote 20,000 to 40,000 double-wheeled, double-furrow plows this year, and also plans to focus on promoting harvesters and seeders.

    试用新农具增产显著
    山西省去年试办的十个新式畜力农具站，在改进耕作技术、提高生产上对农民起了示范作用。十个站去年服务的一百三十个农业生产合作社和十八个互助组用新式畜力农具耕作，每亩平均增产十二斤到十五斤粮食。农具站并且证明了双轮双铧犁在山西南部、中部和北部都很适用。山西南部长子新式畜力农具站用双轮双铧犁为小郭农业生产合作社耕的地，比旧犁耕的地每亩谷多收十四斤，玉米多收十六斤，小麦多收十三斤四两；晋中太原市郊孙家寨社用双轮双铧犁耕地比用旧犁耕的地每亩多收春小麦十六斤九两，谷多收六十三斤，高粱多收五十三斤多。雁北大同马辛庄农业生产合作社用双轮双铧犁耕地比旧犁耕的地每亩莜麦多收十八斤，谷多收十三斤半。在去年使用双轮双铧犁耕地时，各站共组织群众三十三万多人进行了参观，影响很大。许多社因为使用新式畜力农具，对土地进行了合理规划，如夏县大吕村把五百七十二块土地合并成了一百九十多块，去掉地堎地界三百七十五条，扩大耕地面积十亩。许多互助组为了争取使用新农具，在去年冬天转成农业生产合作社。
      现在，各地农民对于新式畜力农具的要求十分迫切，已经向供销社预订二千多部。山西全省今年计划推广双轮双铧犁二万到四万部，并准备重点推广收割机和播种机。
