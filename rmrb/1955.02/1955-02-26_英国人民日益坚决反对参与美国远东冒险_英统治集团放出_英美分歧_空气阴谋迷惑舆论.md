Xinhua News Agency, London, February 25th: TASS London, February 25th: The British press and political figures continue to talk about the "serious differences" that have arisen between the British and American governments on the situation in the Taiwan area, as pointed out by the "Daily Express" and some other newspapers.

The reason for these reports about Anglo-American differences is due to the fact that while the British government supports the United States' policy in the Far East, it cannot ignore the very unfavorable reaction of the British public to Dulles' recent aggressive statements regarding American actions in the Taiwan area. Letters to the editors of various newspapers, comments made by some political commentators, and questions raised in Parliament all demonstrate the great alarm among the British public caused by the aggressive plans of the United States and its attempts to drag the British people into its military adventures. In Britain, a broad protest movement against American aggression in the Far East has been launched.

At the same time, the statements of British leaders indicate that their differences with the leaders of American policy are mainly in tactical methods. The British government has neither abandoned its policy of denying the Chinese people's legitimate rights to their ancient territory of Taiwan, nor has it abandoned its policy of supporting American actions of aggression against the People's Republic of China. The British government merely limits itself to suggesting the "return" of Jinmen and Mazu, two coastal islands, to China, which, like Taiwan and other Chinese islands, are now under the occupation of the American armed forces. Some political commentators believe that Britain's "counter-proposal" regarding the Chinese coastal islands is to be used as a small bargaining chip in the upcoming talks in Bangkok between Eden and Dulles on Southeast Asia's sphere of influence – from which American capitalist monopolies are increasingly squeezing out their British partners.

When answering a question raised in the House of Commons on February 23rd, Churchill said, "There is no question of our being militarily involved in the defense of the coastal islands of Communist China (i.e., Jinmen and Mazu)."

In a written reply, Churchill vaguely referred to the American plan to use military force to support Chiang Kai-shek's rule on these two islands belonging to the People's Republic of China. He said that the decision regarding these islands "is not a matter for the British government to resolve." At the same time, Churchill acknowledged and attempted to justify the American aggressors' forcible occupation of Taiwan and their support for Chiang Kai-shek's people, who, as Churchill said, "are receiving American cover and protection there (Taiwan)."

Churchill made a typical attempt by the British ruling group to groundlessly talk about the threat to the United States of "attack from Communist China" to "justify" American aggression, although everyone knows that the People's Republic of China does not intend to attack the United States or any other country.

The National Executive Committee of the British Labour Party passed a resolution on February 23rd, demanding that the British government "make it clear to the American government that it cannot expect any military assistance from Britain in hostilities related to the coastal islands," and demanding that the British government "use its influence over the United States to withdraw Kuomintang troops from these islands."

The resolution stated that "participation of representatives from Beijing in the United Nations is a necessary part of the solution to the Far East problem."

Regarding the status of these Chinese islands, the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party referred to the 1943 Cairo Declaration, in which Britain and the United States recognized Taiwan as an indivisible part of China.

However, violating logic and the basic principles of international law, the Labour leaders suggested in this resolution that Taiwan and Penghu be "neutralized" "through international guarantees," thereby severing the territory of the People's Republic of China.

Political observers point out that this unrealistic proposal is not fundamentally different from the British government's vicious plan – that the People's Republic of China should abandon its legitimate rights to Taiwan in exchange for "recognition" of its just and indisputable right to own two of its coastal islands. However, the ambiguous wording in the Labour proposal cannot hide the fact that this proposal, like the British government's proposal, aims to justify aggression against the People's Republic of China, and to infringe upon the sovereignty and national interests of the great Chinese people.

The "Manchester Guardian" of February 24th pointed out that the difference between the government's attitude and the Labour Party's proposal "may be more apparent than real."

Churchill's speech and the resolution of the Labour Party's National Executive Committee revealed the confusion that exists among the British ruling groups, who are vainly trying to use various methods to confuse public opinion in order to weaken the rising movement against British participation in military adventures in the Far East.

    英国人民日益坚决反对参与美国远东冒险
    英统治集团放出“英美分歧”空气阴谋迷惑舆论
    【新华社二十五日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十五日讯：英国报界和政界人士继续谈论——如“每日快报”和一些其他报纸所指出的——英国政府和美国政府在台湾地区的局势问题上产生的“严重分歧”。
    所以有这些关于英美分歧的消息是由于这个事实：英国政府虽然支持美国在远东的政策，却不能无视英国广大公众对杜勒斯最近关于美国在台湾地区的行动的侵略性的声明的非常不利的反应。各报编辑收到的读者来信、一些政治评论员发表的言论以及在议会中提出的一些质问，都证明了美国的侵略计划和它打算把英国人民拖入它的军事冒险中去的企图在英国公众中间引起的巨大惊慌。在英国，已经展开了一个反对美国在远东的侵略的广泛的抗议运动。
    同时，英国领袖们的言论表明，他们主要在策略方法上同美国政策的领袖们有所不同，英国政府既没有放弃否认中国人民对他们自古以来的领土台湾的合法权利的政策，也没有放弃支持美国侵略中华人民共和国的行动的政策。英国政府仅仅限于建议把金门和马祖这两个沿海岛屿“归还”中国，这两个岛屿同台湾和其他中国岛屿一样现在都在美国武装部队占领之下。有些政治评论员认为，英国的关于中国沿海岛屿的“反建议”是要在艾登和杜勒斯即将在曼谷就东南亚势力范围——美国资本主义垄断集团正在日益把它们的英国伙伴从那里排挤出去——举行的会谈中当作一笔小找头。
    邱吉尔二月二十三日在答复下院中提出的一个问题时说，“并不存在我们在军事上牵连到共产党中国沿海的岛屿（即金门岛和马祖岛）的防御中去的问题”。
    邱吉尔在书面答复中含糊其词地谈到美国使用军事力量来支持蒋介石在这两个属于中华人民共和国的岛屿上的统治的计划。他说，关于这些岛屿的决定“并不是要由英国政府负责解决的问题”。同时邱吉尔承认并且设法为美国侵略者强占台湾和他们支持蒋介石的人的这种粗暴干涉辩解，就像邱吉尔所说的，蒋介石的人“在那里（台湾）得到美国的掩护和保护”。
    邱吉尔作了英国统治集团的典型的尝试，毫无根据地说什么威胁到美国的“来自共产党中国的进攻”的话来为美国的侵略“辩解”，虽然大家知道，中华人民共和国并不打算进攻美国或其他任何国家。
    英国工党全国执行委员会在二月二十三日通过了一项决议，要求英国政府“明白告诉美国政府，在和沿海岛屿有关的敌对行动中，它不能指望得到英国的任何军事援助”，并且要求英国政府“利用它对美国的影响来使国民党军队从这些岛屿撤退”。
    决议说，“北京代表参加联合国这件事是远东问题的解决的一个必要部分”。
    谈到这些中国岛屿的地位，工党全国执行委员会提到了一九四三年的开罗宣言，在这个宣言中，英国和美国承认台湾是中国的不可分割的部分。
    但是，工党领袖们违反了逻辑和国际法的基本准则，在这个决议中建议“通过国际保证”使台湾和澎湖“中立化”，从而割裂中华人民共和国的领土。
    政治观察家们指出，这种不现实的建议同英国政府所提出的这样的恶毒计划——中华人民共和国应当放弃它对台湾的合法权利以交换对它拥有它的沿海岛屿中的两个岛屿的正当和无可争辩的权利的“承认”，并没有原则上的不同。但是，工党建议中的含糊的措辞，并不能遮盖这个事实：这个建议正像英国政府的建议一样，目的在于使对中华人民共和国的侵略成为正当的，在于侵犯伟大的中国人民的主权和民族利益。
    二月二十四日的“曼彻斯特卫报”指出，政府的态度和工党的建议之间的分歧“也许与其说是实际上的不如说是表面上的”。
    邱吉尔的谈话和工党全国执行委员会的决议透露了英国统治集团中间所存在的混乱，他们正在徒劳无益地用各种办法迷惑舆论，以便削弱反对英国参加远东军事冒险的日益高涨的运动。
