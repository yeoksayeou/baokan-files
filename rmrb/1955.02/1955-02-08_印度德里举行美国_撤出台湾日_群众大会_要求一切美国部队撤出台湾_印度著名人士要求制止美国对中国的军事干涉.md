Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 7th. The Delhi State Peace Council held a mass meeting on "U.S. Get Out of Taiwan Day" at Gandhi Square in Delhi on the 6th. More than two thousand people participated in the meeting. Historian Dr. S. Vidyalankar served as chairman of the meeting.

    The meeting unanimously passed a resolution demanding the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Taiwan. The resolution emphasized that Taiwan is an indivisible part of China. The occupation of Chinese territory and territorial waters by foreign troops is an act of aggression. All peace-loving people must condemn this act.

    The resolution stated: "The U.S. imperialists have been building Taiwan Island into a base for launching aggression against the Chinese mainland, and have been training and equipping Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops for this purpose. The Americans are also maintaining large armed forces of their own, including naval and air forces, in and around Taiwan. Recently, the U.S. government has signed a military alliance and aid treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek puppet clique, and has further strengthened the concentration of their troops along the Chinese coast. Under the protection of their American masters, Chiang Kai-shek's puppet troops have constantly carried out military harassment and air raids against the Chinese mainland, and have carried out countless attacks on merchant ships going to Chinese seaports." The resolution pointed out that while carrying out this military aggression against the Chinese mainland, the U.S. imperialists have also been clamoring for the establishment of "two Chinas," plotting to split China's territory in this way.

    The resolution demanded that the representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek clique be expelled from the United Nations and that the government of the People's Republic of China—the only government representing 600 million Chinese people—participate in the Security Council and other agencies of the United Nations.

    Sundarlal, Vice-Chairman of the All-India Peace Council and Chairman of the India-China Friendship Association, spoke at the meeting. He said: "At present, there is a dangerous situation in the Taiwan issue, and the United States is threatening to carry out military aggression against China. Therefore, we must demand everywhere: No atomic war; the United States must withdraw from Taiwan, withdraw from Asia; China and India are brothers; Asians are brothers." He concluded: "The Taiwan issue is not only related to China, it is also our problem, and it vitally affects the peace and security of India."

    Sharma, Chairman of the Delhi State General Trade Union, said at the meeting:
  "Today, the danger of war is caused by the fact that a large number of foreign troops are concentrated in the Taiwan Strait and the Chinese sea. The United States is not only helping Chiang Kai-shek militarily, but also wants to retake China." He said: "U.S. troops are making full preparations to launch an aggression against China." Sharma also refuted the absurd claim that the United States "defends" Taiwan for U.S. "security." Sharma went on to condemn the so-called slogan of "two Chinas," saying that the Chinese people "will never recognize Taiwan as an independent country. Taiwan and China are inseparable."

    M. Bagria, Secretary of the Delhi State Peace Council, said: "Whatever happens in Taiwan today is not only related to China alone, but to the whole of Asia and the world. All of this can also happen here and elsewhere in Asia."

    Bagria then condemned the United States for playing the conspiracy of "ceasefire" in order to strengthen its control over Taiwan. He said, "Taiwan belonged to China even before the United States was founded. Therefore, China is not prepared to bow to U.S. intimidation or the cunning slogan of a so-called ceasefire." Bagria added: "Today is the era of peace, not the era of atomic bombs. This voice of peace will overwhelm all warmongers, and no force in the world can resist this great force of peace."

    Shan La Jain, a member of the Delhi State Legislative Assembly, in his speech demanded that the United States withdraw from Taiwan and Asia and stop interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.

    The meeting read a telegram from Sokhey, Vice-Chairman of the All-India Peace Council and winner of the Stalin International Prize for "Strengthening International Peace." The telegram stated: The people of India fully support the Chinese people's demand for the liberation of Taiwan. The Chinese people's struggle to liberate Taiwan is a struggle against imperialism.

    The meeting also read a congratulatory telegram from the Chinese People's Committee for the Defense of World Peace.

    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 6th. More than twenty-five influential members of parliament and political leaders from various parties in India held a two-day emergency meeting on February 3rd and 4th. The meeting was chaired by Dewan Chaman Lall, a member of parliament from the Indian National Congress. The meeting reviewed the recent situation in Taiwan and unanimously passed a resolution condemning U.S. military intervention.

    The resolution stated that in accordance with the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation, "the people of India consider Taiwan and related places to be part of the People's Republic of China in territorial, political and legal terms."

    "The meeting regrets that this basic situation, recognized by international agreements, has been changed in the implementation of the policies of certain countries, which believe that this land, which legally belongs to China, should now be considered foreign land and should be subject to the defense needs of the Chiang Kai-shek regime on the one hand and the United States on the other."

    "This policy reached its culmination in the military treaty signed by the United States and Chiang Kai-shek last December. This treaty provides a false legal basis for the military occupation of Taiwan and related places."

    The resolution further stated that "U.S. responsible leaders, in implementing this policy of obstructing the People's Republic of China from demanding the return of their territory, have hinted at the use of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. Moreover, a situation has arisen in which, according to the U.S. President's message to Congress, the United States 'must be prepared to take appropriate military action to deal with any concentration of Chinese Communist troops obviously for the purpose of facilitating an attack.'"

    The resolution emphasized that "it is for this reason that the Indian people unanimously express their opposition to this policy and appeal to the responsible leaders of all countries to demand an end to this policy, which threatens to plunge mankind into a third world war."

    The meeting also made the following recommendations on this point:
    To convene a meeting in order to implement the declaration that Taiwan and related places are part of the territory of the People's Republic of China;
    All foreign troops to withdraw from these areas;
    To recognize the People's Republic of China as the de facto and de jure government of China and to grant it its legitimate status in the United Nations Organization.

    The meeting decided to write to Prime Minister Nehru, expressing full support for his efforts to ease world tensions.

    Copies of the resolutions passed by the above meeting have been sent to members of parliament from different parties in the Indian parliament and to members of the Delhi State Legislative Assembly, asking them to sign them.

    Among the prominent figures attending the meeting were V. Dakji, Leader of the Opposition in the Federal Council of the Indian Parliament; Amar Nath Vidyalankar, Member of Parliament of the Indian National Congress; Nami Chandra Kesriwal, Member of Parliament of the Indian National Congress; Madame Manmohini Sehgal, a well-known Delhi Congress leader; Koidram P. Gidwani, Member of Parliament of the People's Socialist Party of India; and Romesh Chandra, Secretary-General of the All-India Peace Council.

    印度德里举行美国“撤出台湾日”群众大会
    要求一切美国部队撤出台湾
    印度著名人士要求制止美国对中国的军事干涉
    【新华社新德里七日电】德里邦和平理事会六日在德里甘地广场举行了美国“撤出台湾日”群众大会。参加大会的有两千多人。历史学家萨·维迪亚兰卡博士担任大会主席。
    大会一致通过了一项决议，要求一切美国部队撤出台湾。决议强调指出，台湾是中国不可分割的一部分。外国部队霸占中国领土和领海，乃是侵略行为。一切爱好和平的人民，必须谴责这种行为。
    决议说：“美帝国主义者一直在把台湾岛建成一个向中国大陆发动侵略的基地，并且一直在为这个目的训练和装备蒋介石的傀儡军。美国人还在台湾和台湾附近的海面上保持着他们自己的大量武装部队，包括海军和空军。最近，美国政府已经和蒋介石傀儡集团签订了军事同盟和援助条约，并且在中国沿海一带进一步加强集结他们的军队。蒋介石的傀儡军在他们的美国主子的庇护下，不断对中国大陆进行军事骚扰和空袭，并且对到中国海港去的商船进行了无数次的攻击。”决议指出，美帝国主义者在对中国大陆进行这种军事侵略的同时，还一直在叫嚷成立“两个中国”，阴谋用这种办法来分裂中国的领土。
    决议要求把蒋介石集团的代表驱逐出联合国，让中华人民共和国政府——代表六亿中国人民的唯一的政府——参加安全理事会和联合国的其他机构。
    全印和平理事会副主席、印中友好协会主席森德拉尔在会上发言。他说：“目前，台湾问题上存在着危险的局势，美国正威胁要对中国进行军事侵略。因此我们必须在每一个地方要求：不准进行原子战争；美国必须撤出台湾，撤出亚洲；中印两国是兄弟；亚洲人是兄弟。”他最后说：“台湾问题不单单同中国有关，它也是我们的问题，它至关紧要地影响着印度的和平和安全。”
    德里邦总工会主席夏尔马在大会上发言说：
  “今天战争的危险是由于大量的外国军队集结在台湾海峡和中国海面这一事实引起的。美国不仅在军事上帮助蒋介石，而且还想重新夺取中国。”他说：“美国部队正在作全面的准备来发动对中国的侵略。”夏尔马还驳斥了美国所谓“保卫”台湾是为了美国“安全”的荒谬说法。夏尔马接着谴责所谓“两个中国”的口号，他说，中国人民“决不会承认台湾是一个独立国。台湾和中国是不可分割的”。
    德里邦和平理事会书记马·巴格里亚说：“台湾目前无论发生什么事情，都不仅仅关系到中国一国，而是关系到整个亚洲和全世界。这一切也都能够在这里和亚洲的其他地方发生。”
    巴格里亚接着谴责美国玩弄“停火”阴谋，以便加强对台湾的控制。他说，“甚至在美国还未立国时，台湾就属于中国了。因此，中国是不准备在美国的威吓或所谓停火的诡诈口号面前低头的。”巴格里亚又说：“今天是和平的时代而不是原子弹的时代。这种和平的声音将压倒所有的战争贩子，世界上没有任何力量能够抵挡得住这支和平的巨大力量。”
    德里邦立法会议议员山·拉·贾殷在发言中要求美国撤出台湾和亚洲，停止干涉其他国家的内政。
    大会宣读了全印和平理事会副主席、“加强国际和平”斯大林国际奖金得奖人索克的电报。电报说：印度人民完全支持中国人民解放台湾的要求。中国人民解放台湾的斗争是反抗帝国主义的斗争。
    大会还宣读了中国人民保卫世界和平委员会的贺电。
    【新华社新德里六日电】印度国会中属于各党派的二十五位以上的有势力的议员和政治领袖们在二月三日和四日举行了两天的紧急会议。主持会议的是印度国会国大党议员德万·查曼拉尔。会议审查了台湾最近的局势，并且一致通过了谴责美国进行军事干涉的决议。
    决议说，按照开罗宣言和波茨坦公告，“印度人民认为台湾和有关地方在领土、政治和法律方面都是中华人民共和国的一部分。
    “会议感到遗憾的是，国际协定承认的这种基本情况在某些国家的政策的推行中被改变了，这些国家认为，这个在法律上属于中国的土地现在应该被认为是外国的土地，要从属于蒋介石政权一方和美国另一方的防御需要。　　“这种政策在去年十二月美国同蒋介石签订军事条约的时候达到了顶点。这个条约为军事占领台湾和有关地方提供了虚伪的法律根据。”　　决议又说，“美国的负责领袖们在执行这种阻挠中华人民共和国要求归还他们的领土的政策时，已经暗示要使用核子武器和其他大规模毁灭性武器。而且，已出现了这样一种局面，在这种局面下，据美国总统致国会的咨文说，美国‘必须准备采取适当的军事行动，以便对付中国共产党军队显然为了便利进攻而进行的任何集中。’”
    决议强调说，“正是由于这个原因，所以印度人民一致表示反对这种政策，并且吁请各国的负责领袖们要求制止这种有使人类陷入第三次世界大战的危险的政策。”
    会议也就这一点提出如下的建议：
    召开会议，以便实施关于台湾和有关地方是中华人民共和国领土的一部分的宣言；
    一切外国军队从这些地区撤退；
    承认中华人民共和国是事实上的和法律上的中国政府，而给予它在联合国组织中的合法地位。
    会议决定写信给尼赫鲁总理，表示全力支持他在缓和世界紧张局势方面所作的努力。
    上述会议通过的决议的副本已经分送给印度国会中属于不同政党的议员们以及德里邦立法会议的议员们，请他们在上面签名。　　出席会议的著名人士中有印度国会联邦院反对党领袖维·达吉；印度国会国大党议员阿马尔·纳特·维迪雅兰卡；印度国会国大党议员纳米·钱德拉·开斯里瓦尔；著名的德里国大党领袖曼莫西里·希哈戈尔夫人；印度国会人民社会党议员科伊德兰姆·普·吉德瓦尼和全印和平理事会秘书长罗米希·钱德拉。
