Seize the Opportunity to Harrow the Frozen Ground in Early Spring
Ma Jueweng

Harrowing the frozen ground in early spring can preserve soil moisture and ensure timely sowing. This is a farming method used by northern farmers to combat drought.

Harrowing the frozen ground in early spring means harrowing the land when it has just thawed, the surface is slightly semi-dry, and livestock and farm tools can operate on the land. This should continue until the lower layer of soil is completely thawed. Why is it necessary to seize this period for harrowing? Because after the winter rain, snow, and low temperatures, the ground freezes, and the soil accumulates a lot of moisture. During the early spring thaw, the temperature is still low, and the evaporation from the ground is relatively small, so the soil moisture loss is not significant. However, after the Jingzhe solar term, the temperature begins to rise gradually, the air becomes drier, and the ground evaporation increases. Land that has not been properly harrowed will lose soil moisture quickly due to the compactness of the soil and the action of soil capillaries, which brings great difficulties to the subsequent sowing work. Therefore, harrowing during the period when the ground is thawing is the most appropriate, as it can loosen the topsoil, reduce soil moisture evaporation, and keep the soil moist. At the same time, after harrowing, the soil structure improves, and air circulation is enhanced, which is conducive to the activity of microorganisms in the soil and promotes the decomposition of soil organic matter. All of these provide favorable conditions for timely sowing and strong seedling growth. Wu Kewu, a farmer from Xiaochengdong Village in Cangshan County, Shandong Province, harrowed his land as soon as it thawed last year, achieving full and strong seedlings, resulting in a yield of twenty to thirty more catties of grain per mu compared to the land that was harrowed later.

The method of harrowing the frozen ground is to use a nail-tooth harrow to harrow vertically first, and then harrow diagonally, or adopt a cross-diagonal harrowing method. The number of harrowings should vary depending on the dryness and wetness of the soil, the amount of clods, and the soil conditions. Generally, harrowing two to three times is sufficient. Too much harrowing is not conducive to preserving soil moisture. It is best to harrow and then level the soil, making it even, fine, and compact.

Some farmers think: "There was a lot of rain and snow last winter, and the soil moisture is good this year. Whether we harrow or not, sowing will not be a problem." Some farmers also think: "It's still early in the season, so there's no hurry to harrow." These ideas are incorrect. The good soil moisture this spring does create favorable conditions for timely sowing, but according to past experience, rainfall in the spring is generally scarce. If a few winds blow, even if the soil contains a lot of moisture, it will quickly dissipate. If we relax our harrowing work, it will cause irreparable losses.

The time for harrowing is approaching. Farmers, especially agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams, should take urgent action, seize the favorable conditions of higher soil moisture this year, and earnestly carry out the work of harrowing the frozen ground to ensure timely sowing and the robust growth of crops.

    抓紧早春顶凌耙地
    马矍翁
    早春顶凌耙地，可以保蓄土壤水分、保证适时播种。这是北方农民向干旱作斗争的一种耕作方法。
    早春顶凌耙地，就是要在土地刚刚解冻、土地表面稍呈半干状态，而牲畜和农具能够下地作业的时候，即进行耙地，一直到下层土壤完全消通前耙完。为什么要抓紧这一段时间来耙地呢！因为经过冬季的雨雪和气温低的影响，地面冻结，土壤内积存不少水分。在早春解冻时，气温仍是较低的，地面的蒸发量也较小，因而土壤水分损失不大。但是一到惊蛰节以后，气温就开始逐渐上升，空气比较干燥，地面蒸发量增大，没有耙耱好的田地，由于土壤紧实和土壤毛细管的作用，土壤水分就容易很快蒸发掉，这给以后的播种工作带来了很大困难。所以只有在顶凌的时候耙地，才是最合适的，它可以疏松表土，减少土壤水分的蒸发，保持土壤反润。同时耙地以后，由于土壤结构改善、空气畅通，这就有利于土壤中的微生物的活动，促进土壤有机质的分解。所有这些，都给适时播种和苗全苗壮提供了有利条件。山东省苍山县小城东村农民伍可五，去年在开春刚化冻时，即行耙地，达到苗全苗壮，结果比晚耙的地，每亩多收二、三十斤粮食。
    顶凌耙地的方法，是用钉齿耙进行纵耙后，再行斜耙，或采取对角交义的耙法。耙的次数因土壤的干湿、坷垃的多少和土质条件而应有所不同，一般地是耙两次到三次，过多地耙，反而不利于保蓄土壤水分。耙后最好耱平，使土壤平匀细碎实落。
    有些农民认为：“去冬雨雪较大，今年墒土好，耙与不耙，播种不成问题。”还有些农民认为：“节气还早呢，耙地不忙。”这些想法是不对的。今年春季的墒土好，固然为适时播种创造了有利条件，但根据以往的经验，春季降雨量一般是稀少的，如果刮上几场风，即使土壤含水较多，也会很快消散。如果放松了耙地工作，一定会造成不可弥补的损失。
    目前离耙地时间已近，农民们，特别是农业生产合作社和互助组应该紧张行动起来，抓紧利用今年土壤含水较多这一有利条件，认真作好顶凌耙地工作，以保证适期播种和庄稼茁壮生长。
