    Helping Transferred Cadres Familiarize Themselves with Industry

    In recent years, Party committees in various localities have transferred a large number of outstanding cadres to support the country's industrial construction. A large number of cadres above the county level have arrived at new posts in various industrial construction sites. This is a significant achievement of the Party in organizational work. However, completing the transfer of cadres is only the first step. The more important task currently facing industrial departments and Party organizations in factories and mines is how to correctly use and cultivate these new backbone elements, to unite and help them settle into their work, become familiar with their work, and allow them to grow rapidly in their new positions.

    Cultivating veteran cadres transferred to industrial departments and gradually making them qualified leading backbone elements on the industrial construction front is a major political and organizational task for the Party organizations in industrial departments. The most serious difficulty in the implementation of China's first Five-Year Plan is the lack of talent, especially the lack of leadership cadres at all levels and in all aspects of industrial construction, and the lack of outstanding commanders, large and small, who can both grasp the Party's policies and principles and be familiar with industrial production knowledge. If we do not solve this difficulty, our industrial construction will be unable to move forward. Precisely because of this, the Party Central Committee decided to transfer a large number of outstanding cadres from various localities to support industrial construction. Most of these cadres are veteran fighters who have undergone relatively long-term training in various Party work posts. They are loyal to the Party's cause, have a relatively high level of political and ideological understanding, and have relatively rich experience in mass work and organizational work. They were faithful executors of the Party's various policies in the past. In the future industrial construction, once they grasp the Party's guidelines and policies for industrial construction, become familiar with the situation of industrial production, and learn certain industrial technical knowledge, they will certainly become a group of outstanding commanders and backbone elements on the industrial construction front. There is no doubt about this.

    Many cadres transferred to industrial construction posts are generally valued by industrial departments and factories and mines. After arriving at their new posts, most cadres can also humbly learn and work hard, and have made significant progress. Many factories and mines have also formed a relatively sound leadership core and enhanced the leadership strength of the enterprise due to the enrichment of this force. This is the basic aspect. However, in uniting and cultivating these transferred cadres, there are still many problems that need to be brought to our attention and improved.

    The first is the issue of learning. How can we help transferred cadres learn the basic theories and guidelines and policies of socialist industrial construction, as well as the basic knowledge of industrial construction, and help them quickly transform from laymen into experts? Most of the cadres transferred to industrial departments have relatively good political conditions and experience in leadership work, but most of them have not been exposed to industry. They are completely unfamiliar with the basic theories and guidelines and policies of socialist industrial construction and with complex modernized industry. Most of them will be working in various leadership positions in the 141 key projects. These enterprises will be built according to the latest Soviet technical standards. If they lack a preliminary understanding of the basic theories and guidelines and policies of socialist industrial construction, and if they lack certain industrial technical knowledge and management knowledge, they will not be able to lead these enterprises. Therefore, learning has become their most important task and their most urgent requirement.

    Organizing transferred cadres to learn about industry can be approached from two aspects. When cadres first arrive in enterprise departments, they can be organized to study general policies and principles and production knowledge related to daily production work. They should be allowed to participate in more production meetings, go deeper into the field, and be allowed to handle some major issues related to production, so that cadres can have the opportunity to learn about some policies and principles and business knowledge related to production, and become familiar with the specific process of production. However, these learning activities alone are not enough. The leadership of factories and mines should also organize cadres to systematically study the basic theories and general policies of socialist industrial construction, and learn scientific knowledge and industrial management knowledge. Factories and mines with the conditions should hire full-time teachers for newly transferred cadres, and even appropriately reduce some of their work or production time, so that they have more time to study in the initial stage of the transfer. This should be resolved according to the specific situation of each factory and mine. If we spend more time and make more efforts in this area today, it will bring great benefits to the Party's cause in the future. Some departments now assign newly transferred cadres to work and then no longer pay attention to them, assuming that they will automatically learn their business after they arrive at their work posts; some departments ask transferred cadres to bear too much temporarily reducible work in the initial stage of the transfer, and do not give them the necessary learning time, and do not pay attention to organizing and helping them to learn; some departments even dislike these cadres for being laymen and not understanding business, and having low scientific knowledge, and therefore do not patiently help them improve. There are also individual factories and mines that have gathered a large number of cadres and then failed to assign them work in a timely manner, letting them live in guest houses for a long time without anything to do, and failing to seize the time to organize them to learn. This approach is very wrong.

    Of course, to learn well, another aspect lies in the efforts of the cadres themselves. Every cadre transferred to an industrial post, no matter how high their previous position or how long their revolutionary history, should put down their airs and adopt the attitude of being willing to be a primary school student, and learn from the original cadres, workers, and technicians. Many of our transferred cadres have done just that. They humbly learn, study hard, and are not懈怠, and finally gradually become familiar from unfamiliarity, and gradually become experts from complete laymen. But some comrades, although their enthusiasm for learning is very high, show an impatient mood, hoping to "become fat with one bite." They start with high demands, regardless of priorities, wanting to learn everything. After encountering difficulties, they become passive and pessimistic, and do not settle into their work; some people cannot put down their airs, thinking that it is too shameful to ask people with lower positions than themselves for advice; some people become complacent after learning some preliminary knowledge and no longer study hard. Some people put all their hopes for learning on formal and systematic learning in schools and training courses, and do not know how to combine it with the handling of various problems in daily work, frequently going deep into the field, and asking the original cadres, workers, and technicians for advice. All these incorrect learning attitudes and methods hinder the normal progress of learning.

    Some transferred cadres, although they work very hard in learning production technology, regard learning technology as the only content. They do not study the basic theories of socialist industrial construction and the Party's guidelines and policies on industrial construction, nor do they understand and study the actual situation and specific problems of the enterprises where they are located. This is also wrong. It is certainly necessary for newly transferred cadres to spend more time and energy learning relevant production technology knowledge, but this must not exclude necessary theoretical and policy learning and research on practical work. Most of the transferred cadres have assumed various leadership positions in enterprises. As a leader of an enterprise or a department, if he only understands technology and does not care about politics, he will inevitably be unable to fulfill his leadership work, and he will inevitably make mistakes in his work.

    An important condition for solving the learning and work of transferred cadres is the unity between transferred cadres and the original cadres of the enterprise. Therefore, the Party organizations of enterprises must educate the newly transferred cadres and the original cadres to take the initiative to unite in friendship, and always pay attention to overcoming all factors that may affect unity. To achieve unity, the main thing is sincere mutual assistance and cooperation in daily work and learning, to improve the organizational life within the Party, and to carry out criticism and self-criticism. In this regard, the cadres who originally worked in the enterprise bear more responsibility. They should take the initiative to enthusiastically help the transferred cadres understand the various situations inside the enterprise, help them to learn, and do their best to solve their difficulties in learning and work, and even in life. Some comrades often reveal a kind of pride in front of the transferred cadres, boasting that they are experts, looking down on the newly transferred cadres, and not enthusiastically helping them. This is very wrong. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in "On the Party": "Our cadres, because of the different nature of their work, work history, and work areas in the revolutionary process, have various differences... They each have their expertise, they each have their inexperience, they each have their advantages, and they each have their shortcomings. Therefore, they should respect each other, learn from each other, help each other, and should not despise each other, complain about each other, or rub against each other... Only when these cadres are well united and cooperate in all occasions can we promote the progress of our common cause." We should remember Comrade Shaoqi's instruction, closely unite the newly transferred cadres in the cause of national industrial construction, so that they can settle down, help them to learn and work.

    Some transferred cadres, before being transferred, often imagined the work of industrial departments as very perfect, but after being transferred to enterprise departments, they found that these departments did not meet their "ideal" and there were still many shortcomings in their work, so they felt disappointed and dissatisfied, and even produced negative emotions. Some of them do not do concrete investigation and research work. As soon as they get off the bus, they talk glibly and criticize and accuse the work of the original cadres indiscriminately, which also affects unity. This attitude is of course also wrong. No revolutionary work can be perfect. Shortcomings and contradictions always exist relatively. Especially industrial construction, which is a completely new cause for the whole Party, problems are inevitable more. Precisely because the Party has seen that the strength of cadres in industrial departments is still very weak today and there are still many shortcomings in the work, the Party has decided to transfer a large number of outstanding cadres to strengthen industrial construction. Therefore, every transferred cadre, seeing these shortcomings, should not be discouraged because of this, but should increase their sense of responsibility, adopt a correct attitude, and assist the original cadres to overcome these shortcomings together.

    Due to their relatively high political awareness and the relatively sufficient education and mobilization work done by the Party committees in various localities beforehand, most of the cadres assigned to the industrial departments this time can happily follow the needs of the country and obey the assignments of the organization, and go wherever there is a need for people. However, a few cadres have shown individualistic sentiments lacking an overall concept. They do not treat work according to the needs of the Party, but according to their personal likes and dislikes as the standard, haggling and making trouble. For example, some people are only willing to work in production management in existing factories, but are unwilling to go to capital construction departments; in existing production factories and mines, they are only willing to work in factories in cities, but are unwilling to work in coal mines; within factories and mines, they are only willing to do work that directly manages and leads production, but are unwilling to do Party and mass work in factories and mines; some are afraid of hardship and are unwilling to participate in field geological exploration and capital construction work, etc. Some people also haggle over living conditions and make a fuss about status. The errors in these many thoughts are extremely obvious. Industrial construction is a whole that includes many aspects of work. No aspect can be lacking or weakened. Every aspect must have strong cadres to work. For the realization of the great ideal of national socialist industrialization, even if we endure some small personal difficulties, this is the greatest honor of a Communist Party member and a revolutionary worker. For the above-mentioned ideological problems of transferred cadres, the Party organizations of industrial leading organs should patiently help them. Of course, for some resolvable living difficulties, the relevant leaders should help them solve them with great enthusiasm and a considerate attitude.

    With the development and expansion of China's industrial construction, not only is the content of production work in enterprises becoming more and more complex, but other work surrounding production, such as Party work, Youth League work, trade union work, etc., is also becoming richer and more complex, and also becoming more and more important. Since 1953, the large number of cadres transferred to support industrial construction have now been mostly settled. The Party committees and administrations of various industrial departments and factories and mines must seize the current opportunity to conduct an in-depth inspection of this work, sum up the experience in this area, in order to improve the work of uniting and cultivating transferred cadres, so that transferred cadres can play a greater role in their work posts.

    帮助转业干部熟悉工业
    各地党委近年来抽调了大批优秀干部，支援国家的工业建设。大批县级以上的干部，已先后到达各个工业建设的新岗位，这是党在组织工作上的一个很大的成绩。但是，完成干部的抽调毕竟只是工作的第一步，目前摆在工业部门和厂矿企业党组织面前更重要的任务，就是如何正确地使用和培养这批新的骨干，团结和帮助他们安心工作和熟悉工作，让他们在新的岗位上迅速地成长起来。
    培养转业到工业部门的老干部，使他们逐步成为工业建设战线上称职的领导骨干，是工业部门党组织一项重大的政治任务和组织任务。我国第一个五年建设计划在执行过程中的最严重的困难，就是缺乏人才，特别是缺乏工业建设中各级组织的各方面的领导干部，缺乏既能掌握党的政策方针，又熟悉工业生产知识的大大小小的优秀的指挥员。我们如果不解决这个困难，我们的工业建设就会无法前进。正因为这样，党中央才决定从各地抽调大批优秀干部来支援工业建设。这些干部，大部分都是在党的各项工作岗位上，经过比较长期锻炼的老战士，他们忠实于党的事业，有比较高的政策思想水平，有比较丰富的群众工作和组织工作的经验。他们过去是党的各项政策的忠实执行者。在今后的工业建设中，当他们一旦掌握了党对工业建设的方针政策，熟悉了工业生产的情况，而且学习到一定的工业技术知识之后，他们也必将成为工业建设战线上一批优秀的指挥员和骨干。这是没有疑问的。
    抽调到工业建设岗位的许多干部，一般的都得到工业部门和厂矿企业的重视。大部分干部到了新的岗位上以后，也都能虚心学习，努力工作，获得了显著进步。有不少的厂矿企业也由于这批力量的充实，形成了比较健全的领导核心，增强了企业的领导力量。这是基本的方面。但是在团结和培养这批转业干部中，目前也还存在着不少的问题，需要引起我们的注意并加以改进的。
    首先是学习问题。如何帮助转业干部学习社会主义工业建设的基本理论和方针政策以及工业建设的基础知识，帮助他们很快地由外行变成内行呢？调到工业部门的干部，绝大部分都有比较好的政治条件，和领导工作的经验，但大都没有接触过工业，他们对社会主义工业建设的基本理论和方针政策，对复杂的近代化工业是完全生疏的，而他们今后大部分都将在一百四十一项重点工程部门担任各级领导工作，这些企业都将按苏联最新的技术标准建设起来，如果对社会主义工业建设的基本理论和方针政策缺乏初步的了解，如果没有一定的工业技术知识和管理知识，就不可能来领导这些企业，所以学习就成为他们最重要的任务和他们最迫切的要求。
    组织转业干部学习工业可以从两方面来着手。在干部初到企业部门时，可以组织干部学习与日常生产工作有关的一般的政策方针和生产知识，多让他们参加生产会议，多深入现场，放手让他们多处理有关生产中某些重大问题，在这些活动中，能使干部有机会学习到有关生产的一些政策方针和业务知识，熟悉生产的具体过程。但是仅仅有这些学习活动是不够的，厂矿企业的领导上还应该组织干部比较系统地学习社会主义工业建设的基本理论和一般政策，学习科学知识和工业管理知识。有条件的厂矿，为新转业干部聘请专职教员，甚至适当减少他们一些工作或生产时间，让他们在转业初期有比较多的时间进行学习，这都是应该按各厂矿具体情况来加以解决的。我们今天在这方面多化一些时间，多作一些努力，将来就会给党的事业带来极大的好处。现在有些部门，把新转业干部分配出去工作以后，从此就不再过问，以为他们到了工作岗位以后就会自动地学好业务；有些部门要转业干部在转业初期担负了过多的暂时可以减少的工作，而没有给他们必要的学习时间，更没有注意组织和帮助他们进行学习；有些部门甚至嫌这些干部外行，不懂业务、科学知识低，因而不耐心帮助他们提高他们。还有个别的厂矿企业，调集了一大批干部之后，不及时地分配工作，让他们长期住在招待所里无所事事，也不抓紧时间组织他们进行学习。这种做法是很不对的。
    当然，要学习得好，另外一方面还在于干部本身的努力。每个转业到工业岗位上来的干部，不管自己过去职位有多么高，革命历史有多么长，都应当放下架子，抱着甘当小学生的态度，向原有干部、向工人、技术人员学习。我们有许多转业干部正是这样做的，他们虚心学习，刻苦钻研，毫不懈怠，终于渐渐地由不熟悉而熟悉，由完全外行而逐渐内行。但也有些同志，学习热情虽然很高，但表现了一种急躁情绪，希望“一口就吃成胖子”，开始要求很高，不分轻重缓急，什么都要学，遇到困难后，就消极悲观，工作不安心；也有些人放不下架子，认为向比自己职位低的人请教，太不光彩；也有一些人，学习到一些初步知识以后，就自满起来，不再刻苦钻研。还有一些人把学习希望完全寄托在学校和训练班的正规的系统的学习上，而不知道结合日常工作中各种问题的处理，经常深入现场，向原有干部、工人和技术人员请教。所有这些不正确的学习态度和学习方法，都妨碍了学习的正常进行。
    还有些转业干部，虽然在学习生产技术方面很努力，但是他们把学习技术当作了唯一的内容，不钻研社会主义工业建设的基本理论和党关于工业建设方面的方针政策，也不了解和学习所在企业的实际情况和具体问题，这也是不对的。初转业的干部，化较多的时间和精力来学习有关的生产技术知识，这当然是必要的，但是这决不能排斥必要的理论政策学习和对实际工作的研究。转业干部大部分都担任了企业的各项领导工作，作为一个企业或一个部门的领导人，如果仅仅只懂得技术，而不问政治，他必然将不能胜任他的领导工作，工作中不可免的会犯错误的。
    要解决转业干部学习和工作的一个重要条件，就是转业干部和企业原有干部的团结问题。所以企业的党组织必须教育新转业的干部和原有的干部，主动地团结友好，随时注意克服可能影响团结的一切因素。要达到团结，主要的还在于日常工作和学习中的相互诚挚的帮助合作，健全党内的组织生活，开展批评和自我批评。在这方面，原来在企业工作的干部负有较多的责任，他们应当主动地热情地帮助转业干部了解企业内部的各种情况，帮助他们进行学习，尽力解决他们在学习和工作中以致生活上的困难。有些同志在转业干部面前常常流露出一种骄傲情绪，夸耀自己是内行，瞧不起新转业的干部，不热情地帮助他们，这是很错误的。刘少奇同志在“论党”中说：“我们的干部，又因为在革命过程中各人的工作性质、工作历史和工作地区的不同，而有各种区别……，各有内行，各有外行，也各有优点，各有缺点。因此，他们应该互相尊重，互相学习，互相帮助，而不应该互相轻视，互相抱怨，互相摩擦。……只有这些干部在一切场合中很好地团结与合作，才能推动我们的共同事业前进。”我们应当记住少奇同志的这个指示，在国家工业建设事业中，亲密无间地团结新转业的干部，使他们安心下来，帮助他们进行学习和工作。
    在转业干部中也还有人在转业以前，常常把工业部门的工作设想得非常完美，但是调到企业部门以后，却发现这些部门并不合乎“理想”，工作上仍有不少缺点，于是就感到失望和不满，甚至产生消极情绪。他们中有的人不作具体的调查研究工作，下车伊始，就夸夸其谈，对原有干部的工作乱批评、乱指责，结果也影响团结。这种态度当然也是不对的，任何革命工作，都不可能是十全十美的，缺点和矛盾总是相对地存在的。特别是工业建设，对全党来说是一件全新的事业，问题就不免多一些，正是因为党看到了今天工业部门干部力量还很薄弱，工作中还存在着不少缺点，党才下决心抽调大批优秀干部来增强工业建设，所以，每一个转业干部看到这些缺点，不但不应该因而泄气，更应当加重自己的责任感，采取正确的态度，协助原有的干部，共同来克服这些缺点。
    这次分配到工业部门的干部，由于他们本身的政治觉悟比较高，以及各地党委事先的教育动员工作做得比较充分，大多数干部都能愉快地做到按照国家的需要，服从组织的分配，那里需要人就到那里去。但也有少数干部表现了缺乏整体观念的个人主义情绪，对待工作不是根据党的需要，而是根据个人的喜恶为标准，讲价钱，闹情绪。例如，有的人只愿意在现有工厂担任生产管理工作，而不愿去基本建设部门；在现有生产厂矿只愿意去城市里的工厂工作，而不愿意去煤矿工作；在厂矿内部只愿意做直接管理和领导生产的工作，而不愿做厂矿的党和群众工作；有的怕艰苦，不愿参加野外地质勘探工作和基本建设工作等等。还有的人计较生活待遇，闹地位，这许多思想的错误是极为明显的。工业建设是一个包括许多方面工作的一个整体，任何方面都是不能缺少和削弱的，任何方面都要有坚强的干部去工作。为了国家社会主义工业化伟大理想的实现，即便忍受一些个人的小困难，这是一个共产党员和革命工作者的最大荣誉。对于转业干部上述思想问题，工业领导机关的党组织应当耐心地帮助他们。当然对于有些可以解决的生活困难，有关领导应当以极大的热情和体贴关怀的态度来帮助他们解决。
    随着我国工业建设的发展和扩大，现在企业中不但生产工作的内容愈来愈复杂，围绕着生产的其他工作，如党的工作、青年团的工作、工会的工作等等，也同样愈来愈丰富和复杂，也愈来愈重要起来。一九五三年以来，抽调支援工业建设的大批干部，现在多已安置完毕，各工业部门和厂矿党委及行政上，很有必要在目前抓紧时机，对这一工作进行一次深入的检查，总结一下这方面的经验，以便把团结和培养转业干部的工作提高一步，使转业的干部能够在自己的工作岗位上发挥更大的作用。
