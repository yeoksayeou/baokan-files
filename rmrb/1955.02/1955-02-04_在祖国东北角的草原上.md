    On the Grassland in the Northeastern Corner of the Motherland
  　Liu Jinglong
    In order to reclaim the wasteland in the northeastern frontier of our motherland, the leadership decided to send me, Wang Jinshan, and Li Changji to form a wasteland survey team to conduct a preliminary survey in the triangular area of Fujin, Fuyuan, and Raohe in Heilongjiang Province.

    On National Day last year, we set off from Fujin and headed northeast. We couldn't see the end of it, it was all grass - sheep grass, willow grass, small-leaf zhang, five-flower grass, three-edged grass... No one could count how many kinds of grass there were here. In the deep places, it could reach the chest, and in the shallow places, it was knee-high. Our minds were full of thoughts of land, and we were constantly recording the soil quality and terrain, rarely having time to appreciate the scenery of this vast grassland.

    The next day we arrived at Qixinggang. It was said that there were families living here twenty years ago, but now there isn't even a wall left. We pulled some grass to spread out and took a rest. Then we busied ourselves with finding a well to draw water and cook. After a lot of effort, we didn't find a well until dark. But the water that was drawn up had a thick layer of green foam floating on it; upon closer inspection, there were four dead field mice in a bucket of water. How could we drink this water? Later, we found a ditch and barely managed to cook the rice. Just as we were about to sleep, it suddenly started to rain, and our clothes and quilts were soaked. The wind was strong, and we couldn't help but shiver. After midnight, the rain turned into snow, and by daybreak, the grassland was covered with a thick layer of snow. When we dug the snow away, the ground was frozen with a seven- or eight-millimeter-thick layer of ice. That is to say, we not only encountered difficulties in life, but also, due to the drastic changes in the climate, our work became more difficult. But when we thought of the importance of our responsibility and the glory of our task, we gained courage. We decided to seize the time and forge ahead bravely!

    From Fujin to Fuyuan is 460 li, passing through a large village of eighty households called Qinderli. At first, we walked, so we could see the appearance of the wasteland within sight. When we reached a small village called Jiejin, there were only mountains ahead, and we couldn't travel by land anymore, so we had to take a boat and navigate the Heilongjiang River.

    In order to reconnoiter the center of this triangular area, we first went to the Fuyuan County Farm, 50 li south of Qinderli. Here, we met a comrade named Zhang Songlin. He was originally an elementary school teacher in Qinderli. In his spare time from teaching, he carefully measured the terrain on the south bank of the Heilongjiang River and designed a plan to install a water pump and open 1,000 hectares of rice paddies. Last year he was transferred here to establish a farm, and the site of the farm now is what he measured. Last year, the farm opened 30 hectares of land, and this year it plans to open another 70 hectares of wasteland. They plan to open 200 hectares of rice paddies and 500 hectares of dry land within five years. They also plan to build a reservoir in a nearby small river, which can irrigate 500 hectares of rice paddies. He enthusiastically introduced the local climate, soil, and terrain, and personally led us out, walked 25 li, to see the terrain, collect wild plants, and helped us dig soil to make specimens, busy for a whole day.

    Fuyuan County is located in the northeasternmost corner of the motherland. The county has a population of 3,200, living in eight villages and towns along the Heilongjiang and Wusuli Rivers. Only 20 percent of the residents are mainly engaged in agriculture, and the rest are mainly engaged in fishing and hunting. Because of this, about 20 percent of the local grain supply depends on outside sources. They very much hope that the state will quickly reclaim the wasteland.

    While in Fuyuan, comrades from the county government introduced us to a place called Hanconggou, hoping we would take a trip there. Hanconggou is 120 li southeast of Fuyuan, in the center of the triangular area of Fujin, Raohe, and Fuyuan. Only by going here can we see the inland situation of this area. We accepted this suggestion. The county government prepared sufficient supplies for us and instructed the village chief of Zhuaji Village to personally help us with our work.

    On the first day of our departure from Fuyuan, we stayed in Zhuaji Village on the west bank of the Wusuli River. Some of the residents here are of the Hezhen ethnicity and are busy with the autumn harvest, fishing. We needed a local person to guide us to Hanconggou. A Hezhen person named Zhang Baozhi, upon hearing about the wasteland survey, voluntarily put down his fishing gear to guide us.

    The road to Hanconggou was also full of meadows and small shrub forests. Sometimes we had to use our hands to push aside the branches to move forward. In the evening, we chose a birch forest to stay in: we spread a thick layer of leaves to use as a bed, and set up a pot next to it to cook, and everyone felt very happy. The further we went, the more water there was. Hanconggou has already become a historical place name, there is nothing here. We recorded the surrounding terrain, collected soil samples, and returned to the Wusuli River, and went down the river to Raohe County.

    This time, we spent a total of 68 days and basically completed the task. The western part of this triangular area, about 500,000 hectares of land, is genuine meadow black calcium soil and leached black calcium soil, with granular structure, loose structure, and contains a large amount of humus, so the organic matter and mineral nutrients are very rich. Among them, one-third of the area can be reclaimed with a plow; more than half of the remaining area can be utilized with just a little drainage engineering. The eastern part has an area of about 1 million hectares, mostly herbaceous gley soil and humus swamp soil, and the soil quality is also very fertile. As long as a unified drainage project is carried out, this large area of land can be utilized. Hanconggou can still be developed. This time we collected soil samples from more than 20 different areas, which will be very useful for further research on the soil here in the future. (Reported by Fang Qing)

### 在祖国东北角的草原上

    在祖国东北角的草原上
  　刘景隆
    为了开垦祖国东北边疆的荒地，领导上决定我和王锦珊、李昌吉三个人组成了一个荒地调查小组去到黑龙江省的富锦、抚远、饶河这个三角地带进行初步调查。
    去年国庆节那天，我们从富锦出发，往东北行走。一眼望不见边，到处是草——羊草、柳毛草、小叶张、五花草、三棱草……谁也数不清这里有多少样草。深处能齐到胸口，浅处也有膝盖高。我们满脑子里想的都是土地，随时记载着土质和地势，很少有功夫来欣赏这大草原的景象。
    第二天到了七星岗。听说这里二十年以前有过人家，可是现在连一堵墙也没有了。我们拔些草来铺上，休息一下。就忙着找井打水作饭。费了很大工夫，一直找到天黑才找着井。可是打上来的水漂着一层浓厚的绿沫；仔细一检查，一桶水里面就有四只死山鼠。这水怎么能吃呢？以后又找了一条水沟，才勉强作熟了饭。正要睡觉，忽然下起雨来，衣服被子都淋湿了。风又大，身上禁不住发抖。过半夜，雨变成雪，到天亮的时候，草原上盖了厚厚一层雪。把雪刨开一看，地面上冻了七、八公厘厚的冰。就是说：我们不仅在生活上遇到了困难，而且由于气候的急剧变化，工作上也增加了困难。但当想到我们责任的重大和任务的光荣时，我们就增加了勇气。我们决定要抓紧时间，奋勇前进！
    从富锦到抚远有四百六十华里，当中经过一个八十户的大村，叫勤得利。开始我们是徒步走，可以就目力所及，看到荒地面貌。到了一个叫作街津的小屯子，前面都是山，旱路不能走了，只得坐着小船，在黑龙江里航行。
    为了向这个三角地带的中心侦察，我们先到了勤得利以南五十里的抚远县农场。在这里，我们遇到一位名叫张松林的同志。他原是勤得利的一位小学教师。教学之余，他仔细测量了黑龙江南岸地形，并设计了安装一台抽水机，开一千垧稻田的计划。去年调来建立农场，现在这个农场所在地，就是他测量的。农场去年开了三十垧地，今年计划再开荒七十垧。他们计划在五年内，开到二百垧稻田，五百垧旱田。还计划在附近一条小河里修水库，可以浇五百垧稻田。他非常热心地介绍当地的气候、土壤和地形，又亲自领着我们出去，走了二十五里地，去看地形，采集野生植物，还帮助我们掘土方作标本，整整忙了一天。
    抚远县在祖国的尽东北角上，全县三千二百口人，分居在沿黑龙江、乌苏里江的八个村镇里，这里的居民除汉族以外，还有朝鲜族和赫哲族。他们以农业为主的仅占百分之二十，其余都是以渔业和狩猎为主。也正因为这样，当地粮食约有百分之二十靠外地供应。他们很希望国家赶快去开垦荒地。
    在抚远时，县政府的同志给我们介绍了一个叫寒葱沟的地方，希望我们去一趟。寒葱沟在抚远东南一百二十里，是富锦、饶河、抚远这个三角地带的中心，到这里，才能看到这个地区的内地情形。我们接受了这个建议。县政府为我们准备了充足的给养，还指示抓吉村村长亲自帮助我们工作。
    从抚远出发的第一天，就住在乌苏里江西岸的抓吉村。这里一部分居民是赫哲族，正在忙于秋收，捕鱼。我们要到寒葱沟，需要有当地人做向导，有一位叫作张宝芝的赫哲族人，听到调查荒地，便自动放下捕鱼工具，替我们带路。
    到寒葱沟的路上，也都是草甸子和小灌木林，有时要用手拨开树条子，才能前进。晚间，我们选择一个桦树林住宿：铺了一层厚厚的树叶，当作床铺，旁边就支上锅做饭吃，大家心里非常愉快。越往前走，水越多。寒葱沟，已经是个历史上的地名了，这里什么都没有。我们记载了周围的地势，采集了土壤标本，便回到了乌苏里江，顺江直到饶河县。
    我们这次共花费了六十八天的时间，基本上完成了任务。这个三角地带的西部，约有五十万垧地，是真正的草甸黑钙土和淋溶黑钙土，团粒组织，结构松散，含有多量腐植质，因此有机质和矿物质的养分很丰富。其中又有三分之一的地区，一来犁杖就能开垦；下剩那一多半，只要稍施排水工程，就能利用。东部约有一百万垧的面积，大部分是生草灰化土和腐植质沼泽土，土质也很肥沃。只要进行统一的排水工程，这一大片地都可以利用。寒葱沟也还是可以开发的。这次我们共从二十多个不同地区采来了土壤标本，对今后进一步研究这里的土壤很有作用。　（方青记）
