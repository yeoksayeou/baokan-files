    Capital and Wuhan Railway Workers Gather to Commemorate the 32nd Anniversary of the "February 7th" Struggle
    Railway workers in the capital held various activities to commemorate the 32nd anniversary of the "February 7th" Struggle.
    More than 500 labor models, advanced producers, and rationalization proposers from the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory held a memorial meeting on the 7th. The conference called on all employees to actively implement work plans, improve technology, and ensure the balanced completion of the 1955 national construction plan, and to support the liberation of Taiwan with practical actions. Veteran workers of the "February 7th" Struggle who work in this factory specifically held a symposium to commemorate the "February 7th" Struggle. These veteran workers have consistently maintained and carried forward the glorious tradition of the "February 7th" Struggle for decades, actively engaging in labor and production. In 1954, thirteen of them were selected as labor models and advanced producers of Beijing Municipality and the factory.
    The units affiliated with the Beijing District Committee of the Chinese Railway Trade Union also held memorial meetings and report meetings successively. At the memorial meeting of Fengtai railway workers, Wang Shan, a veteran worker of the "February 7th" Struggle, reported on the heroic struggle of the working class during the "February 7th" strike. Many veteran workers of the "February 7th" Struggle, labor models, and workers expressed at the meeting that they would carry forward the glorious tradition of the "February 7th" Struggle, strive to complete the transportation tasks of 1955, and support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan.
    The film projection team of the Beijing District Trade Union of the Railway Trade Union also showed slideshows and other films of the "February 7th" revolutionary struggle to workers in the Beijing area, Fengtai area, Baoding, and Zhangjiakou.
                                (Xinhua News Agency) One of the birthplaces of the "February 7th" General Strike—the Jiang'an District of Wuhan City—has held various activities in recent days to commemorate the 32nd anniversary of "February 7th."
    On the morning of the 7th, more than 600 people, including veteran workers of the "February 7th" Struggle, family members of "February 7th" martyrs, advanced producers, and representatives of railway workers, held a grand memorial meeting. Meng Futang, Deputy Mayor of Wuhan City, Su Xing, Vice Chairman of the Wuhan Federation of Trade Unions, and others spoke at the meeting, calling on all railway employees to continue to carry forward the glorious tradition of the "February 7th" Struggle, comprehensively complete the national transportation plan, so as to support national basic construction and the struggle to liberate Taiwan. Wan Nengshan, a driver from the Jiang'an Locomotive Depot and a veteran worker of the "February 7th" Struggle, said: "Our entire depot's workers have achieved a new record of more than 620,000 kilometers of safe driving during the commemoration of 'February 7th'. Now, we have proposed to support national construction with the practical action of 1.2 million kilometers of safe driving." Pan Jinde, a train driver from the Wuchang Locomotive Depot's operating workshop who has twice received medals in Korea, made a guarantee on behalf of the workers to comprehensively overfulfill this year's transportation plan. Veteran workers of the "February 7th" Struggle also jointly wrote a letter to the commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army on the Zhejiang and Fujian fronts, expressing their support and condolences.
    In recent days, workers from various factories, sections, and stations in the Wuhan area railway system have also held various symposiums and memorial meetings. Some schools and public places have also invited veteran workers of the "February 7th" Struggle to give reports. The Wuhan Municipal People's Committee and various people's organizations jointly expressed their condolences to the family members of "February 7th" martyrs in the Wuhan area, and went to Hongshan in Wuchang to sweep the tomb of martyr Shi Yang. The groundbreaking ceremony for the construction of the "February 7th" Martyrs Memorial in Jiang'an District was also held on the 7th. (Xinhua News Agency)
