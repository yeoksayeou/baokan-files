    Is This "Relying on the Poor Peasants"?
    Liu Sanhu

    There was a Comrade Geng who led a key agricultural production cooperative. He was quite "diligent" in reading the newspapers, and had long memorized the class policy of "relying on the poor peasants..." When speaking to the backbone members of many cooperatives around his key cooperative, he would give long speeches like this: "The Chinese Communist Party is the political party of the working class, and the poor peasants are semi-proletarian, closest to the working class; in the countryside, whatever work we do, we must rely on them. Especially in mutual aid and cooperation..." He was afraid that everyone would not accept this, so he repeatedly explained it over and over again; he would criticize this person for "not firmly implementing the class policy" at every turn, that person for "not understanding how to rely on the poor peasants"; this person for "not clearly distinguishing class boundaries", that person for "not having a clear class viewpoint". One cooperative chairman was even brought to tears by his criticism.

    Last autumn, in the village where the key cooperative led by Comrade Geng was located, twelve peasant households requested to join the cooperative. Comrade Geng counted on his fingers, and suddenly was shocked, the smile quietly slipping from the corner of his mouth. He put on a stern face and mumbled in his throat: "Oh, this household has no livestock, this household lacks large farm tools... and that guy, he just doesn't look right..." He was considering: "If these people are absorbed into the cooperative, the old members will suffer too much... the cooperative is just starting to look good, if these households are added, it will be difficult again..." He seemed to have encountered something very difficult, and his brow furrowed tightly.

    With a furrowed brow, a plan came to mind: joining the cooperative cannot be stopped, so let them join! Soon, at a meeting to evaluate the means of production, Comrade Geng proposed: "The old members' farm tools and livestock were evaluated very reasonably in the past, so there's no need to re-evaluate them, just evaluate the new members'." This cooperative originally had four large carts, which were actually only worth 5.8 million yuan, but they deliberately said they were evaluated at more than 8 million yuan; at that time, the prices of livestock and farm tools were falling, and the new members' livestock and farm tools had to be evaluated at the temporarily reduced prices. Some new members had no livestock or farm tools, but had to "pay shares" according to the old prices. Those who had no livestock or farm tools could not afford to "pay", and those who had a little farm tools also felt they were suffering a loss. Ten poor peasant households enthusiastically requested to join the cooperative, but a "bucket of cold water was poured on their heads", so they had to give up.

    Comrade Geng smiled contentedly and said: "We welcome poor peasants to join the cooperative, but they have to be able to withstand the 'four evaluations'!" Someone criticized this matter, and he said: "It's not that I don't let them join the cooperative, they just insist on withdrawing, what can I do?" Someone exposed his "clever plan", and he had no words to answer, saying after a long time: "This is the idea of the cooperative members!"

    Talking about "relying on the poor peasants" all the time, but trying every possible means to exclude them. Comrade Geng's class stand had long flown to the ninth heaven.

    这是“依靠贫农”吗？
    刘三虎
    有一位耿同志，领导着一个重点农业生产合作社。他看报倒是挺“认真”，早把“依靠贫农……”的阶级政策念得烂熟了。他对重点周围的许多合作社的骨干分子讲话的时候，也会这样讲一大套：“中国共产党是中国工人阶级的政党，贫农是半无产阶级，跟工人阶级最接近；在农村里无论做什么工作，都必须依靠他们。特别是互助合作方面……”他怕大家接受不了，翻来覆去地一再讲解；动不动就批评这个“执行阶级政策不坚决”，那个“不懂得依靠贫农”；这个“划不清阶级界限”，那个“阶级观点不明确”。有一位合作社的社长竟被他批评得大哭了一场。
    去年秋天，在耿同志领导的那个重点社所在的村子里，有十二个农户要求入社。耿同志扳着指头算了一算，突然大吃一惊，笑容从嘴角悄悄溜走，板起了面孔，在喉咙里咕哝着：“哦，这一户没有牲口，这一户缺少大农具……，还有那个家伙，看起来就不顺眼……”他在考虑：“吸收这些人入社，老社员太吃亏……社才办得像个样了，这些户一添进去，可就又难办了……”他好像碰到了多么为难的事情，眉头紧紧地皱在一起了。
    眉头一皱，计上心来：入社是不能阻挡的，就让他们入吧！不久，开会评议生产资料，耿同志提出了：“旧社员的农具牲口过去评得很合理，不用再评，光评一下新社员的吧。”这个社原来有四辆大车，实际上只值五百八十万元，却故意说评的是八百多万元；当时牲口农具正是跌价的时候，要新社员的牲口农具按暂时跌了的价钱评定。有些新社员没有牲口农具，却要按照老价“贴股子”。没牲口农具的“贴”不起，有一点点农具的也嫌吃亏。有十户贫农热呼呼地要求入社，一瓢“冷水浇头”，只好不入社了。
    耿同志满意地微笑着说：“贫农入社咱欢迎，格住（受得了）四评就能行！”有人对这事提出了批评，他就说：“不是不让他们入社，他们非退出去不行，我有啥法？”有人把他的“妙计”揭穿了，他无言答对，好久才说：“这是社员们的主张呀！”
    口口声声“依靠贫农”，千方百计排斥贫农。耿同志的阶级立场早跑到九霄云外去了。
