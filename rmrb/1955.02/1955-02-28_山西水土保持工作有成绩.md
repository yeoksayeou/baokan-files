Shanxi's soil and water conservation work has achieved results. According to incomplete statistics, by the end of last year, the province had built more than 2.6 million various soil and water conservation projects, and had also built terraces, afforested, and planted pasture on more than 7.3 million mu, thus controlling an area of nearly 7,300 square kilometers and intercepting more than 5.4 million cubic meters of sediment. This has greatly reduced the slope flow rate, protected many mountain feet from collapse and severe soil erosion, and also reduced the harm of mountain floods downstream. In the past, when floods occurred in Dongmafanggou, Jingle County, they would drain in just over three hours. Since the start of soil and water conservation projects in 1953, with the same amount of rainfall, the flood flow time has been extended to a day and a half, and clear water has flowed continuously for more than a month, allowing farmers to feed a large number of cattle and sheep. After Baizhagou, Xing County, built more than 100 mu of terraces last year, the yield per mu increased threefold compared to the past.

In order to further extensively carry out soil and water conservation work, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government has allocated a large amount of funds, trained a group of key personnel for soil and water conservation work, and sent technical cadres to the countryside to cooperate with various special counties in carrying out key surveys and overall planning work. At present, 42 mountainous counties and 75 key townships in the province have formulated long-term plans for building mountainous areas. (Wu Jian)

    山西水土保持工作有成绩
    山西省水土保持工作获得成绩。据不完全统计，到去年年底止，全省已修建了各种水土保持工程二百六十多万座，并且还修梯田、造林、种牧草等七百三十多万亩，因而控制面积近七千三百平方公里，拦蓄泥沙五百四十多万公方。大大降低了坡度流速，保护了许多山脚坍塌和水土严重流失，也减少了下游山洪危害。静乐县东马房沟过去每年发洪水时，三个多小时即流完了。自一九五三年开始兴修了水土保持工程后，相同的雨量，洪水流的时间却延长到一天半，并连续流清水一个多月，使农民可以大量喂养牛羊。兴县白家沟去年修了一百多亩梯田后，每亩产量比过去提高了三倍。
    山西省人民政府为了进一步广泛开展水土保持工作，拨出了大批经费，并训练一批水土保持工作的骨干分子，又派技术干部下乡配合各专县进行了重点勘查全面规划工作。目前全省已有四十二个山区县和七十五个重点乡订出了长期建设山区的计划。　（吴健）
