    The People's Power Can Surely Guarantee Peace
    Wang Chonglun, Special-Class Labor Model of Anshan Iron and Steel Works
    In 1953, I completed four years and forty-seven days' worth of work; the workers in our workshop also completed two years and seventeen days' worth of work in one year. In 1954, although our work tasks increased significantly compared to 1953, I still completed the annual workload with a surplus of 90 percent; the workers in our workshop completed the entire year's workload one month ahead of schedule by the end of November last year. We are able to actively complete national tasks in this way in order to build our motherland into a happy, prosperous, and powerful socialist state as soon as possible.
    However, facts over the past few years have proven that the American aggressive bloc always wants to turn our country into their colony. The American aggressive forces have brazenly occupied Taiwan, our country's territory, directly interfered in our country's internal affairs, and are now actively preparing to use atomic bombs to launch a nuclear war that would slaughter humanity. All of this shows that the American aggressive bloc is not only the enemy of the Chinese people, but also the enemy of all peace-loving people in the world. Therefore, responding to the call of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council to participate in the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons is a serious protest against the American aggressive bloc.
    The young workers in our workshop and I deeply understand that while responding to the call of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Council for a signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons, we must also use practical actions of improving technology and working hard in production to develop our country's economic construction and consolidate our national defense. Now, with the development of Anshan Iron and Steel Works, our tool workshop began to expand in November last year. The workers in our workshop and I are actively working hard to learn new technologies, better complete the more arduous tasks the state has given us in 1955, accelerate the construction of our motherland, and support the People's Liberation Army in liberating Taiwan.

    人民的力量一定能够保证和平
    鞍山市特等劳动模范　王崇伦
    我在一九五三年一年内作了四年零四十七天的工作；我们车间的工人也在一年内作了两年零十七天的工作。一九五四年，我们的工作任务虽然比一九五三年增加了很多，但我又以超额百分之九十的成绩完成了全年的工作量；我们车间的工人在去年十一月底就提前一个月完成了全年的工作量。我们能够这样积极地完成国家任务，就是为了把我们祖国早日建成一个幸福、繁荣和强大的社会主义社会国家。
    可是，几年来的事实证明，美国侵略集团却总想把我们的国家变成为他们的殖民地。美国侵略势力蛮横地强占了我国的领土台湾，直接干涉我国的内政，现在又积极准备利用原子弹来发动屠杀人类的原子战争。这一切都说明了美国侵略集团不仅是我们中国人民的敌人，而且也是全世界爱好和平人民的敌人。因此响应世界和平理事会常务委员会的号召，参加反对使用原子武器的签名运动，就是向美国侵略集团表示严重抗议。
    我和我们车间的青年工人们都深深地知道，在响应世界和平理事会常务委员会反对使用原子武器签名运动号召的同时，还要用提高技术，努力生产的实际行动来发展我国的经济建设，巩固国防。现在我们工具车间随着鞍钢的发展，从去年十一月间即开始扩建，我和我们车间的工人正在积极努力学习新技术，更好地完成一九五五年国家给我们的更繁重的任务，加快建设我们的祖国，支援人民解放军解放台湾。
