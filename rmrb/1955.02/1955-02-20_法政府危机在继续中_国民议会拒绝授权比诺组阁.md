Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 19th: Following Pinay and Pflimlin, Christian Pineau, the Socialist who was appointed to form a cabinet, has failed like Pinay and Pflimlin. In a vote held in the early morning of the 19th, the French National Assembly rejected authorizing Pineau to form a government by a vote of 312 to 268. The French government crisis has now entered its third week.

Prior to the National Assembly's overnight discussions and voting, Pineau first delivered a speech on his policy program and presented his cabinet list on the afternoon of the 18th. Among the cabinet members selected by Pineau, 70 percent were supporters of the already bankrupt "European Army" plan.

Pineau, whom American news agencies have called "one of the most pro-American members of parliament" in France, emphasized in his speech that in order to "continue to be loyal to our allies and Atlantic solidarity," his government would do its utmost to ensure that the London and Paris agreements on the rearmament of West Germany were approved "as soon as possible." He also repeated Mendès-France's hypocritical rhetoric of conducting "parallel negotiations with the East" (i.e., parallel with the ratification of the Paris agreements). He also proposed so-called "reforms" of the tax system, "reforms" in North Africa, and increases in the minimum wage, etc., in an attempt to win over the people and gain support.

However, the result of the National Assembly's vote on the 19th proved that Pineau could not even obtain a relative majority of votes from the members of the National Assembly. The members of parliament who voted against Pineau's formation of a cabinet included members of the Communist Party and the Progressive Republican Union, most of the Gaullist members, so-called "moderate" members including the Independent Republicans and the Farmers' Party, and some Radical Socialist members.

As the French government crisis becomes more and more serious, the American pressure on France is also intensifying. American newspapers are constantly launching insulting attacks on France. The "New York Times," when talking about the "unreliability" of French politicians, wrote angrily that the French government crisis is hindering the French Republic's Senate from passing the final resolution on the Paris agreements, and may only fail because of the lack of political leadership. According to the Washington correspondent of the French "Le Figaro," the French government crisis has made Washington deeply concerned about the fate of the Paris agreements. From this reporter's report, it can be seen that the American ruling clique is threatening French political figures that the United States may expect West Germany to implement their European military plan because Washington believes that France is "unreliable."

### 法政府危机在继续中  国民议会拒绝授权比诺组阁

    法政府危机在继续中
    国民议会拒绝授权比诺组阁
    【新华社十九日讯】巴黎消息：继比内和普夫朗朗之后受命组阁的社会党人克里斯吉安·比诺，同比内和普夫朗朗一样失败了。法国国民议会在十九日清晨举行的表决中以三百一十二票对二百六十八票拒绝授权比诺组织政府。法国政府危机至此就进入了第三周。
    在国民议会连夜进行讨论和举行表决之前，比诺在十八日下午首先发表关于他的施政纲领的演说并且提出他的内阁名单。在比诺挑选的阁员中，有百分之七十是已经破产的“欧洲军”计划的拥护者。
    被美国通讯社称做法国“议会中最亲美的议员之一”的比诺在演说中强调：为了要“继续忠实于我们的盟国和大西洋团结”，他的政府将竭尽全力使重新武装西德的伦敦和巴黎协定“尽快地”获得最后批准。他同时重复孟戴斯—弗朗斯所说的要“同东方进行平行谈判”（就是说与批准巴黎协定平行）的虚伪论调。他还提出所谓“改革”税制、在北非实行“改革”和增加最低工资等等企图笼络人心，争取支持。
    但是，国民议会十九日的表决结果证明：比诺甚至无法获得国民议会议员的相对多数票。投票反对比诺组阁的有共产党和进步共和联盟的议员，戴高乐派的大部分议员，包括独立共和党、农民党在内所谓“温和派”的议员和一部分激进社会党议员。
    在法国政府危机越来越严重的同时，美国方面对法国的压力也越来越加紧了。美国报纸不断对法国进行侮辱性的攻击。“纽约时报”在谈到法国政治家“不可靠”时愤怒地写道，法国政府危机阻碍了法国共和国参议院通过关于巴黎协定的最后决议，并且可能只是由于没有政治领导而使它失败。据法国“费加罗报”驻华盛顿记者指出，法国政府危机使华盛顿对巴黎协定的命运深感不安。从这个记者的报道中可以看出，美国统治集团在恐吓法国政界人士说，美国可能指望西德来实现他们的欧洲军事计划，因为华盛顿认为，法国“不可靠”。
