    Diligent Coal Miner Wang Hengcheng

    Six Years of Perfect Attendance
    Since liberation, Wang Hengcheng, a coal miner at Benxi Coal Mine, has had perfect attendance for six years. Before the first half of 1954, Wang Hengcheng's home was always located in Hedong Street, more than five li away from the mine. He had to climb over a mountain and pass through a tunnel more than one li long to get to and from work. He couldn't ride a bicycle on the rugged mountain road, nor could he take a car, and there were no street lights in some places. The coal mine operated in three shifts. When Wang Hengcheng worked the first shift, he had to leave home in the dark at four o'clock in the morning. When he worked the second shift, he didn't get home until after midnight. If he had the third shift, he had to walk from home to the mine at eight o'clock in the evening. Over the past six years, Wang Hengcheng has encountered countless storms, but these difficulties have not prevented him from attending work every day.
    In the past six years, Wang Hengcheng has never allowed personal matters to affect even one minute of production time. Last September, when Wang Hengcheng's wife was about to give birth, his family moved from Hedong District to Hexi District. Wang Hengcheng originally wanted to take a day off to move, but when he thought that he was a Communist Party member and the leader of a production team, he hired two carts on the street and continued his normal production.
      Five Years Without Accidents
    Since Wang Hengcheng had an accident in the spring of 1949, he has paid great attention to safe production. When he went down to the mine, he would first check the working face and repair any unsafe areas. While working, he could humbly listen to the foreman and the old workers, and consciously abide by the operating procedures. In this way, he was able to safely complete the task under any difficult conditions. For example, in April last year, the working face of West Sixth Lane was very low, the roof was leaking water, the bottom was filled with water, and the roof condition was very bad. The coal mining foreman assigned this task to Wang Hengcheng. After Wang Hengcheng made a detailed inspection and analysis of the adverse conditions of the working face, he lay in the water and used a pneumatic drill, and he shored up the roof in time according to the operating procedures, and completed the task half an hour ahead of schedule. Wang Hengcheng not only paid attention to safe production himself, but also helped others establish the idea of safe production. There was a worker in their team named Zhang Guangxue, who was very capable in production, but he had a paralyzing mentality, did not pay attention to safety, and often violated operating procedures. Wang Hengcheng actively used specific people and specific events in the pit to educate him, so that he gradually established the idea of safe production.
    Because Wang Hengcheng can consciously abide by various rules and regulations, and can lead everyone to do a good job in safe production, he was named a model of safe production at Benxi Coal Mine.
      "Good Method is Better than Great Strength"
    Early on, Wang Hengcheng relied on his strong body and did not quite believe in advanced experience. Once, he and Zhang Lifu, an old worker in his team, were working together. He saw that Zhang Lifu was holding the pneumatic drill and working very fast. He picked up the pneumatic drill and worked hard, but he was not as fast as Zhang Lifu. Wang Hengcheng thought: I am a young man, and I am not as good as an old man! He dropped the pneumatic drill, picked up a hand pick and worked hard, sweating all over, but he was not as good as Zhang Lifu. Wang Hengcheng said to himself embarrassedly: "Good strength is not as good as a good method!" After that, Wang Hengcheng actively learned advanced experience. He was not used to using the pneumatic drill at first, so he took the time to go to the place where Zhang Lifu, the "pneumatic drill expert" of the team, was working to see how Zhang Lifu used the pneumatic drill, and asked Zhang Lifu to explain the method of using the pneumatic drill. Wang Hengcheng tried it according to Zhang Lifu's method, and it didn't take much effort. He saw pieces of coal falling down, and when he calculated at the end of the shift, he had done more than any other day. A few days later, due to the good cooperation within the team, they once created a record of mining fifteen stacks in one day.
    Give Play to Collective Strength
    When Wang Hengcheng was first promoted to production team leader, because most of the team members were young workers, the quality of the props was often not up to standard. He firmly remembered the Party's education to him: "We must rely on the masses and use the collective strength to complete the production task." One day, Wang Hengcheng and the old worker Sha Deshan were walking on the road. Wang Hengcheng said with a smile: "Master Sha, you have to help us with technology. The quality of the props in our team is not high, so we rely on you to find a solution!" Sha Deshan said with a smile: "I am not better than you young people, young people have good brains."
    "That's not true, you are older, you know more things for every dou of rice you eat, we young people have less knowledge and experience!" Wang Hengcheng said again.
    Sha Deshan thought that Wang Hengcheng was hypocritical, but this time he felt very comfortable after hearing his words, so he secretly made up his mind to test whether Wang Hengcheng was sincerely or falsely modest. He said: "The key to good props is to pay attention to setting the first set of props straight...".
    Wang Hengcheng felt that this was a good experience, so he went to work and experimented with the workers in the team, and as a result, the props were up to standard. After that, Sha Deshan took the initiative to serve as a lecturer at Wang Hengcheng's production team's technical research meeting, teaching all his skills to the young workers.
    In order to better complete the production tasks of the entire team, Wang Hengcheng actively taught the techniques he had learned to the young apprentices. In April last year, he and his apprentice Zhang Xiuhai signed a master-apprentice contract. Thanks to Wang Hengcheng's unreserved help, Zhang Xiuhai's technical level has been raised to the standard of a sixth-grade technician in just three months. Last year, the two of them completed 23 months of coal mining quota, increasing the country's production of more than 3,000 tons of coking coal.
    With technology, coupled with their sense of responsibility as masters, Wang Hengcheng's team not only has high output, but also achieves good quality, high savings, and low cost. In the record of Wang Hengcheng's team's completion of the plan, the stone content in each month is lower than the national standard, and the working face specifications also meet the national requirements. They can save 11 cubic meters of pit wood for every lane they enter, and recover 47 tons more of raw coal, creating a wealth of about 12.57 million yuan for the country, and ensuring safety.
      Strong Overall Concept
    Wang Hengcheng not only often completes his tasks ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota, but also has a clear concept: coal mining is a job that requires mutual cooperation. If one working face cannot complete the task for the day, it will affect the normal cycle of the entire working face. Therefore, he often thinks about the entire team and the entire working face. When he himself completes the task for the day ahead of schedule, he takes the initiative to help others with their work. Once in February last year, when the shift was about to stop, the old worker Feng Zhishan in their team still had one stack left to complete. Wang Hengcheng knew about it, and carried a pneumatic drill to help Feng Zhishan mine coal. When the task was completed, Feng Zhishan said to Wang Hengcheng with emotion: "If it weren't for your help, our working face would have disrupted the normal cycle of operations because I couldn't complete the task." One shift in July last year, Wang Hengcheng finished the first lane and was preparing to work on the second lane when he found that the worker Zhang Daishan in the team had only completed one of the five sets of prop tasks. After inquiring, he learned that the roof of the place where Zhang Daishan was working was broken and the coal seam was hard, so Zhang Daishan did not dare to let go of mining. At this time, Wang Hengcheng took the initiative to discuss with Zhang Daishan and exchanged the second lane with a good roof that he was working on for Zhang Daishan to work on, and he himself started working in the place where Zhang Daishan was working. Because Wang Hengcheng seriously produced in accordance with the operating procedures, not only did he not have an accident, but he also completed the production task for the day ahead of schedule.
    Once, after Wang Hengcheng completed the task, he asked the foreman: "Is there anyone who has not completed the task? I'll go and do it!"
    The foreman replied: "No one." Wang Hengcheng saw that the cart was being pushed slowly, and immediately put down the pneumatic drill and went to push the coal cart. The workers were very moved when they saw it, and everyone's morale was boosted. In a short while, they overfulfilled the task.

    勤勤恳恳的采煤工人王恒成

    六年不缺勤
    本溪煤矿采煤工人王恒成自从解放以来，六年没有缺过勤。一九五四年上半年以前，王恒成的家一直是住在离矿井五里多路的河东街。他上下班要翻过一座山，穿过一里多长的隧道。在崎岖不平的山路上，不能骑自行车，也不能通汽车，有的地方没有路灯。煤矿是三班作业，王恒成上第一班时，就要在清晨四点多钟摸黑由家动身，上第二班时，他回到家已是下半夜，赶上第三班，他要在晚上八点多钟从家往矿井走。六年来，王恒成不知遇到过多少次暴风骤雨，但这些困难都阻挡不住他天天出勤。
    六年来，王恒成从来没有让私事影响过一分钟的生产时间。去年九月间，王恒成的爱人快要临产的时候，他的家从河东区迁移到河西区，王恒成本想请一天假搬家，可是当他想到自己是个共产党员，又是生产小组长的时候，就到街上雇了两辆车，自己还是照常生产。
      五年不出事故
    王恒成从一九四九年春天发生过一次事故以后，就非常注意安全生产。他下了矿井先要检查一遍掌子情况，那儿有不安全的地方就修理。在干活时他能虚心听取班长和老工人的话，并自觉地遵守操作规程。这样，使他在任何艰险的条件下，都能安全地完成任务。比如，去年四月间，西六道一接掌子面很矮，顶上漏水，底下积水，而且顶板情况很不好。采煤班长把这个任务交给了王恒成。王恒成对掌子恶劣情况作了细致的检查和分析后，就躺在水里打风镐，根据操作规程及时厦顶，结果提前半小时完成了任务。王恒成不但自己重视安全生产，而且能够帮助别人树立安全生产的思想。他们组里有个叫张广学的工人，在生产上很能干，但存在着麻痹思想，不重视安全，并常常违犯操作规程。王恒成积极地用本坑的具体人、具体事教育他，使他逐渐树立起安全生产的思想。
    由于王恒成能够自觉地遵守各种规程制度，并能带动大家搞好安全生产，被评为本溪煤矿安全生产模范。
      “力大不如方法好”
    在早，王恒成仗着自己身板硬实，不太相信先进经验。一次，他和本班老工人张立福在一块干活，看见张立福把着风镐干得真快，自己就拿起风镐猛干，但总没有张立福干得快。王恒成心想：我是个年青人，还比不上老头儿！他丢掉风镐，拿起手镐使劲刨，累得满身大汗，还比不上张立福。王恒成不好意思地对自己说：“力气大不如方法好呀！”此后，王恒成就积极学习先进经验了。他刚使用风镐不习惯，因此就抽空到本班“风镐能手”张立福干活的地方去，看看张立福是怎样使用风镐的，并请张立福讲解使用风镐的方法。王恒成按照张立福的方法一试验，也没有费多大劲，只见煤炭一片一片地往下掉，下班一计算，比哪一天都干得多。几天之后，由于组内配合得好，曾创造了一天一个号头采十五个垛的最高纪录。
    发挥集体力量
    王恒成刚刚被提拔当生产组长时，因为组内多是青年工人，棚的棚子经常不合规格。他牢牢地记着党对他的教育：“必须依靠群众，用集体的力量完成生产任务。”有一天，王恒成和老工人沙德山走在路上。王恒成笑着说：“沙师傅，你要多帮助咱技术呀。咱组内棚的棚子质量不高，就靠你给想办法解决啦！”沙德山笑着说：“俺不比你强老少，年青人脑瓜好使。”
    “那儿的话，你年纪大一些，多吃一斗米多懂一件事，咱年青人见识少，经验差！”王恒成又说。
    沙德山本认为王恒成虚伪，这回听了他的话感到挺顺耳，因此暗中拿定主意，试试王恒成真虚心还是假虚心。他说：“棚好棚子的关键，就是注意把第一架棚子棚正……”。
    王恒成觉得这是个好经验，上班就和组内工人进行了试验，结果，棚的棚子合了规格。这以后，沙德山就主动地担任王恒成生产小组技术研究会的讲师，把自己的技术全教给青年工人。
    王恒成为了更好地完成全组的生产任务，积极地把自己学来的技术教给青年徒工。去年四月间，他和徒工张秀海订立了师徒合同。由于王恒成毫无保留的帮助，仅三个月，张秀海的技术水平已提高到六级技工的标准了。去年他们两个人完成了二十三个月的采煤定额，给国家增产了三千多吨的炼焦煤。
    有了技术，加上他们的主人翁的责任感，王恒成小组不但产量高，而且做到了质量好、节约多、成本低。在王恒成小组完成计划情况的记录里，每个月的含石率都比国家规定的指标低，掌子规格也合乎国家的要求。他们每进一巷就能节省坑木十一立方公尺，多回收原煤四十七吨，给国家创造约一千二百五十七万元的财富，并保证了安全。
      坚强的整体观念
    王恒成不仅经常提前超额地完成自己的任务，而且他有个明确的观念：采煤是大家互相配合的活，一个号头完不成当天任务，就会影响整个掌子的正规循环。因而他经常想到整个班、整个掌子。当他自己提前完成了当天任务后，就主动地去帮助别人工作。去年二月间的一次，眼看就要停风接班了，他们班里的冯志山老工人还剩下一个垛没完成。王恒成知道了，扛着风镐就去帮冯志山采煤。赶到完成任务时，冯志山感动地对王恒成说：“要不是你的帮助，咱们掌子就会因为我完不成任务，打乱了正规循环作业。”去年七月间的一个班，王恒成干完了第一巷，正准备去干第二巷的时候，发现组内工人张岱山才完成五架棚子任务中的一架，一打听，才知道张岱山干的那个地方顶板破碎，煤层硬，张岱山没敢放手采。这时，王恒成主动地和张岱山商量，把自己干的那个顶板好的第二巷换给张岱山去干，他自己就在张岱山干的地方干起来。由于王恒成认真地按照操作规程生产，不但没出事故，并且提前完成了当天的生产任务。
    一次，王恒成完成了任务后问班长：“还有谁没完成任务，我去干！”
    班长回答说：“没有了。”王恒成看到车推得慢，马上放下风镐去推煤车。工人们看了都非常感动，大家情绪振奋起来，不一会，就超额完成了任务。
