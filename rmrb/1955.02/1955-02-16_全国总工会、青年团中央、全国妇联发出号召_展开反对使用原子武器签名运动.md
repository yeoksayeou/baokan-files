    Xinhua News Agency, February 15th:

    All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, and the All-China Democratic Women's Federation have each issued notices and appeals, calling on workers, youth, and women across the country to enthusiastically participate in the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons.
    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, in its notice, called upon workers, staff, and engineering technicians across the country to play a leading role, as they have in past movements, and actively participate in the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons. The notice also instructed: Trade union organizations in provinces, cities, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region should actively participate in this movement under the unified leadership of the signature campaign committee at their respective levels; all propaganda tools and propaganda organizations of the trade unions should be mobilized to publicize the heinous conspiracy of American imperialism to clamor for the use of atomic weapons and the achievements of the Soviet Union in atomic energy science, and to publicize the determination of the Chinese people to liberate Taiwan. The notice also called on the masses of workers and staff to express the firm will and strength of the Chinese working class in defending world peace and opposing the use of atomic weapons with practical actions to complete and overfulfill national production plans.
    The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League issued an appeal to the youth of the whole country. The appeal called on the youth of the whole country: In order to defend our country's ongoing socialist peaceful construction, to defend world peace and our bright future, everyone should actively participate in the signature campaign against the use of atomic weapons, to express their will to love peace and defend peace. The appeal also requires all members of the Youth League and Young Pioneers to participate in the signature campaign and, in coordination with relevant parties, to widely publicize to the masses and mobilize everyone to sign together against the use of atomic weapons.
    The All-China Democratic Women's Federation, in its appeal to women across the country, said: Dear sisters, the more signatures we have on the "Appeal to the People of the World," the greater the strength of Chinese women to support the liberation of Taiwan, consolidate Sino-Soviet friendship, defend world peace, and oppose atomic weapons. The signatures of hundreds of millions of Chinese women and hundreds of millions of mothers will undoubtedly greatly promote the international women's peace movement. The appeal requires women, mothers, and sisters across the country, regardless of age, to actively sign, spread the meaning of the signature throughout families, relatives and neighbors, and throughout streets, alleys, and villages, and strive to get the largest number of women to participate in this solemn and sacred signature movement. The appeal instructed staff of women's federations at all levels to, under the leadership of local signature campaign committees, universally convene women's representative meetings or small women's meetings down to the grassroots level, carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda and mobilization work among the masses of women to involve the broad masses of women in this movement, and pay attention to creating a high tide of women's signatures in various activities commemorating this year's "March 8th" International Women's Day in various cities and towns.
