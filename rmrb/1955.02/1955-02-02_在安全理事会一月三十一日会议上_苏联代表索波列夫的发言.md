    At the Security Council Meeting on January 31st
    Soviet Representative Sobolev's Speech
    I, acting on instructions from the Soviet government, have proposed that the issue of "the United States of America's acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China in the Taiwan and other island regions of China" be included on the agenda of the Security Council meeting, and that this issue be considered as an urgent and important matter.
    This proposal is made because the United States' acts of aggression in Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and other coastal islands belonging to the People's Republic of China have created a direct threat to international peace and the threat of another war.
    The United Nations Charter stipulates that the Security Council has the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security. The Security Council cannot ignore the numerous acts of aggression by the United States of America against the People's Republic of China in Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, and other coastal islands of China. These acts of aggression are manifested in unwarranted armed attacks on Chinese cities and coastal areas by armed forces under US control, the concentration of US naval and air forces in the aforementioned areas, and official statements by US politicians threatening to use force against the People's Republic of China.
    I do not intend to discuss all of the aforementioned acts of aggression in detail now, but I will address them in more detail when considering the substance of this issue.
    However, I will briefly discuss some recent developments that are of great importance to maintaining peace in the Far East.
    As everyone knows, the US President submitted a message to Congress on January 24, in which he clearly threatened to wage war against the People's Republic of China and demanded the power to use armed forces to "defend" Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, located in the Chinese sea area and belonging to China. In other words, the power to use US armed forces to openly interfere in China's internal affairs.
    The US Congress passed a proposal regarding the President's message, authorizing the US President to "use US armed forces when he deems it necessary for the specific objective of ensuring and protecting Taiwan and the Penghu Islands" from non-existent armed attacks. The US Congress's proposal states that this power is not limited to the Taiwan area. It includes ensuring and protecting "related positions and territories in this area" and "taking such other measures as he determines to be necessary or appropriate to assure the defense of Taiwan and the Pescadores."
    The false argument about so-called "guaranteeing security," "ensuring and protecting" certain territories cannot divert public attention from the true purpose pursued by the United States in this region. These territories have never belonged to the United States, and the aggressors have long harbored conspiracies against them. The true purpose of the proposal passed by the US Congress is well-known, which is to allow the US armed forces to freely take aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China in Taiwan and the Chinese coastal island areas. The US President himself has virtually admitted the aggressive nature of this proposal in his message to Congress, where he said that the United States "must leave no doubt that we (referring to the Americans) are prepared to fight, if necessary, to safeguard the vital interests of the free world in maintaining a free Taiwan and to engage in any military action necessary to achieve that purpose."
    What vital interests does the United States have in Taiwan that would be a problem? Taiwan is 11,000 kilometers away from the United States and is an inseparable part of Chinese territory! Is it not obvious that the problem is that the US armed forces are preparing to launch a direct aggression against the Chinese mainland under the guise of "defensive" actions and "preventive war"? Statements by several prominent members of the US House of Representatives and Senate have also confirmed this, in which they admitted that President Eisenhower's message and the proposal passed by the US Congress are a direct approval for waging war against the People's Republic of China.
    For example, Senator Brick said that the Congressional proposal is an ultimatum containing "the danger of an expected war." Senator Flanders said: "To put it plainly, this is a preventive war." US officials, in explaining the meaning of the President's message and the proposal passed by Congress, openly clamored for bombing important centers, ports, and transportation lines in mainland China.
    No wonder world public opinion regards this recent step taken by the US government as a step to increase the danger of war in the Far East and to exacerbate international tensions.
    It should be pointed out that before the US Congress passed the proposal on the so-called "preventive war," a large number of US air and naval forces were concentrated in the Chinese sea area. According to US newspapers, there are currently five US aircraft carriers in this area. Each of these aircraft carriers carries 75 to 100 jet fighters and light bombers. In addition, there are currently three US heavy cruisers, about forty destroyers, about fifty auxiliary ships for landing, and some other types of naval vessels in this area. In addition, according to the United Press, three cruisers and eight destroyers are sailing from ports on the west coast of the United States to the Taiwan area. The US military command has also ordered the transfer of the US's largest aircraft carrier, the "Midway," to that area, which carries about 115 jet bombers and fighters. In addition, 75 US jet fighters have been transferred from other areas to the Taiwan area.
    On January 26, the US Air Force conducted a provocative "show of strength" off the Chinese coast. According to newspaper reports, 300 fully combat-equipped US military aircraft participated in this demonstration. All of this proves that someone is preparing to take new large-scale aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China.
    The US rulers are attempting to cover up their aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China by issuing statements about "defending the United States" and "protecting Taiwan and the Penghu Islands." However, it is quite obvious that these statements are false and unfounded, because the United States has not been threatened by anyone, nor does anyone intend to threaten it. The actions taken by the government of the People's Republic of China to clear its own territory do not threaten any foreign country; this is China's internal affair. Any interference by the US government in the Chinese people's liberation of their own territory from the Chiang Kai-shek gang can only be regarded as an act of aggression against the People's Republic of China. The US officials often repeat that China has created a threat to the security of this region. This statement is completely unfounded. The sole purpose of putting forward this statement is to divert world opinion from the United States' actions of aggression against the People's Republic of China. The United States armed forces have consistently violated China's airspace and territorial waters for many years, while Chinese armed forces have never violated the airspace and territorial waters of the United States.
    It is the US fleet that is actually blockading the Chinese coast, and the Chinese fleet has not cruised along the US coast near San Francisco or New York.
    The United States' aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China and its interference in China's internal affairs are long-standing matters. The US government's hostile actions against the Chinese people are merely a new link in a long chain of aggressive acts.
    It is well-known that on June 27, 1950, the US President ordered the US Seventh Fleet and armed forces to take coercive actions against China's Taiwan Island and other Chinese islands, and placed the Chiang Kai-shek gang, which had been driven out by the Chinese people and entrenched in Taiwan and some coastal islands, under their protection. As a result, the US Navy established military control over the entire Taiwan area, and Taiwan was occupied and turned into a US military base.
    This constituted a blatant interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state, the use of threats of force to undermine the inviolability of the territory of the People's Republic of China, all of which violated the United Nations Charter. The United States of America violated one of the important principles of the United Nations Charter, and at the same time violated universally recognized norms of international law.
    These actions by US forces are intended to prevent the Chinese people from liberating Taiwan and prevent them from exercising their inalienable sovereignty over this island.
    The so-called "mutual defense" treaty concluded with the Chiang Kai-shek clique on December 2, 1954, is another act of aggression by the United States against the People's Republic of China. Since the Korean War had ceased, the US government could no longer use this war as an excuse to continue its occupation of Taiwan. Therefore, it attempted to use this treaty to ensure its occupation of Chinese territories - Taiwan and the Penghu Islands. It can be seen from the text of the treaty and Mr. Dulles' statement - which stated that the signing of this treaty "will once and for all eliminate the rumors and reports that the United States would in some way agree to hand over Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to Communist control" - that the purpose of concluding this treaty was to separate Taiwan and the Penghu Islands from China and establish US rule over these territories that have long belonged to China.
    It is noteworthy that the treaty stipulates that its scope of implementation be expanded far beyond the boundaries of the Taiwan area and the Penghu Islands, to any territory "as determined by mutual agreement," as the treaty states. This can only be regarded as preparing for new acts of aggression against the People's Republic of China not only in the Taiwan area but also in other parts of the territory of the People's Republic of China.
    The above actions of the United States are a gross violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the People's Republic of China, thereby violating the United Nations Charter, in particular, the provisions of Article 2, paragraph 4, which states: "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any member state or state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations."
    These actions by the United States also violate the obligations undertaken by the United States of America under the 1943 Cairo Declaration and the 1945 Potsdam Proclamation, which stipulated that Taiwan and the Penghu Islands must be incorporated into the Chinese mainland after Japan's surrender.
    The above matters illustrate that the actions of the US armed forces in Taiwan and other Chinese island areas constitute aggression against the People's Republic of China and are the source of tensions in the Far East. At the same time, it is clear that these actions also endanger international peace and security in that region.
    At a time when the threat to peace is becoming more serious and international tensions are intensifying, the United Nations has no right to ignore it. The fact that the United Nations has not yet taken action to stop the United States of America's aggressive actions has encouraged new steps towards war. One cannot fail to see that the recent resolution of the US Congress on the use of US armed forces to ensure the so-called "security of Taiwan and the Penghu Islands," the concentration of massive US military forces in the Chinese sea area, and the demonstration of "strength" are open interference in China's internal affairs and direct provocations against the People's Republic of China.
    It is quite obvious that the dangerous international tension in the Far East can only be eliminated when the United States stops its interference in China's internal affairs and withdraws its armed forces from Taiwan and other Chinese islands.
    This explains why it is necessary for the Security Council to urgently review the draft resolution proposed by the Soviet Union. This draft resolution stipulates that the United States should immediately take steps to end its aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China and its interference in China's internal affairs, and immediately withdraw all its air, sea, and land forces from Taiwan and other territories belonging to China. This draft resolution also stipulates that either party prevent hostile actions in the Taiwan area to facilitate the withdrawal from the islands in that area of all armed forces that do not belong to the People's Republic of China.
    In submitting this draft resolution, we are deeply convinced that the adoption of such a resolution by the Security Council will not only achieve a ceasefire but also eliminate the roots of the current international tension in this region.
    The Soviet delegation also proposes that the Security Council invite representatives of the People's Republic of China to participate in the consideration of this issue.
    As for the New Zealand representative's proposal to the Security Council regarding the issue of reviewing the hostile actions occurring in certain island areas along the coast of mainland China, this proposal circumvents the most important issue of eliminating the roots of the tension in the Far East.
    This proposal reduces the entire issue to a ceasefire, and only a ceasefire on a small group of Chinese islands. The New Zealand representative's letter talks about hostile actions occurring in certain island areas along the coast of mainland China, and emphasizes that these hostile actions are said to be endangering the maintenance of peace and security. Not a word in the letter mentions the real reasons why the threat to peace in the Far East has developed.
    The New Zealand representative explained at a press conference on January 28 that those who initiated the proposal to raise this issue in the Security Council are trying to get the belligerents to cease fire. The letter does not specify exactly which islands along the coast of mainland China are in question. However, at the same press conference, the New Zealand representative clarified that what was being referred to were coastal islands like the ones that he said "go south from the Dachen Islands and include Jinmen." He also said that this issue has no impact on Taiwan or the Penghu Islands. It is quite clear that the New Zealand proposal, just like the "mediating" remarks about a ceasefire in the Taiwan Strait, has nothing in common with the desire to restore peace in the Far East. They have only one purpose, which is to interfere in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China, demanding that it abandon its sovereignty to remove the Chiang Kai-shek gang supported by the United States from its own territory.
    A ceasefire in the coastal island areas - which some people are trying to portray as a "peaceful" act - is actually nothing more than a clumsy conspiracy aimed at forcing the People's Republic of China to abandon its sovereignty over Taiwan and the Penghu Islands, which have long belonged to China, and consolidating the United States of America's illegal occupation of these islands.
    For the above reasons, the Soviet delegation opposes including the item proposed by the New Zealand representative in its form and content on the agenda of the Security Council. At the same time, we resolutely advocate that the Soviet Union's proposal on "the United States of America's aggressive actions against the People's Republic of China in Taiwan and other island regions of China" be included on the agenda of the Security Council and given urgent consideration, because this proposal aims to eliminate the source of the danger of another war in the Far East.

### 在安全理事会一月三十一日会议上  苏联代表索波列夫的发言

专栏：

    在安全理事会一月三十一日会议上
    苏联代表索波列夫的发言
    我奉苏联政府的训令，已经提出了一个建议，要求把“关于美利坚合众国在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为”的问题列入安全理事会会议议程，并且要求把这个问题作为一个紧急和重要的问题加以审议。
    所以提出这个建议，是由于美国在台湾、澎湖列岛和其他属于中华人民共和国的沿海岛屿地区的侵略行为，已经造成了对国际和平的直接威胁和爆发另一次战争的威胁。
    联合国宪章规定安全理事会负有维持国际和平和安全的主要责任，安全理事会不能不注意美利坚合众国在台湾、澎湖列岛和中国其他沿海岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的许多侵略行为。这些侵略行为表现在受美国控制的武装部队对中国城市和沿海地方进行无端的武装攻击、美国海空军部队集中在上述地区、以及美国政治家的官方声明威胁要使用武力对付中华人民共和国。
    我现在不打算详细地谈论所有上述的侵略行为，而准备在审议这个问题的实质的时候再详细加以谈论。
    但是，我将简单地谈一谈最近同维持远东和平有重大关系的某些发展。
    大家知道，美国总统在一月二十四日向国会提出了一项咨文，他在咨文中明白威胁要对中华人民共和国进行战争，并要求授予为了所谓“保卫”位于中国海区域而且属于中国的台湾和澎湖列岛而使用武装部队的权力，换句话说，就是使用美国的武装部队来公开干涉中国内政的权力。
    美国国会就总统的咨文通过了一项提案，授权美国总统“在他认为对确保和保护台湾和澎湖列岛”不受并不存在的武装进攻这个“具体目标是必要的时候使用美国武装部队”。美国国会的提案说，这一权力并不只限于台湾地区。它包括确保和保护“这个地区的有关阵地和领土”以及“采取他断定为保证台湾和澎湖列岛的防御所必需或适当的其他这样的措施”。
    关于所谓“保证安全”、“确保和保护”某些领土的虚伪论点是不能转移公众对美国在这个地区所追求的真正目的的注意的，这些领土从来就不是美国的，侵略分子长期以来一直对它们怀有阴谋。美国国会通过的提案的真正目的是人所共知的，那就是让美国武装部队放手在台湾和中国沿海岛屿地区对中华人民共和国采取侵略行动。美国总统自己在他给国会的咨文中实际上已经承认了这个提案的侵略性质，他在那个咨文中说，美国“必须使人毫不能怀疑我们（这是指美国人）准备在必要时进行战斗，来维护自由世界在保持一个自由台湾方面的重大利益，并从事为了达到这个目的所必需的任何军事行动”。
    美国在台湾有什么重大利益会成为问题呢？台湾离开美国有一万一千公里，是中国领土的不可分割的一部分！成为问题的是美国武装部队准备以“防御”行动、“预防性战争”为幌子对中国大陆进行直接侵略，这难道还不明显吗？美国众议院和参议院的若干著名议员的发言也证实了这一点，他们在发言中承认，艾森豪威尔总统的咨文和美国国会通过的提案是直接批准对中华人民共和国进行战争。
    例如，参议员布里克就说国会的提案是一个最后通牒，其中包含“意料之中的战争危险”。而参议员弗兰德斯则说：“说得明白些，这就是预防性战争。”美国官员在解释总统咨文和国会通过的提案的含义时，公开扬言要轰炸中国大陆的重要中心、港口和交通线。
    无怪乎世界舆论把美国政府最近采取的这个步骤看成是增加远东战争危险和加剧国际紧张局势的步骤。
    应当指出，在美国国会通过关于所谓“预防性战争”的提案以前，在中国海区域就集中了大批美国空军和海军部队。据美国报纸报道，目前在这个区域有五艘美国航空母舰。这些航空母舰中每艘载有七十五架到一百架喷气战斗机和轻轰炸机。此外，目前在这个区域有三艘美国重巡洋舰，约四十艘驱逐舰，约五十艘供登陆用的辅助舰只和一些其他种类的海军舰只。此外，据合众社报道，有三艘巡洋舰和八艘驱逐舰正在从美国的西海岸港，驶往台湾地区。美军司令部还命令把美国最大的航空母舰“中途号”调往那个地区，“中途号”上载有约一百一十五架喷气轰炸机和战斗机。另外还有七十五架美国喷气战斗机已经从其他地区调到台湾地区。
    一月二十六日，美国空军在中国海岸进行了一次挑衅性的“实力示威”。据报纸消息，参加这次示威的有全副战斗装备的美国军用飞机三百架。所有这一切都证明，有人正在准备对中华人民共和国采取大规模的新的侵略行动。
    美国统治者企图掩盖他们对中华人民共和国的侵略行动，他们发表了一些关于“保卫美国”和“保护台湾和澎湖列岛”的声明。但是，十分明显，这些声明是虚伪的，是毫无根据的，因为美国并没有受到任何人的威胁，也没有任何人打算威胁它。中华人民共和国政府为扫清它自己的领土而采取的行动并不威胁任何外国，这是中国的内政。美国政府对中国人民从蒋介石匪帮手中解放他们自己的领土所进行的任何干涉，只能被认为是对中华人民共和国的侵略行为。美国官员常常重复说，中国制造了对这个地区的安全的威胁，这种说法是完全没有根据的。提出这种说法的唯一目的就是转移世界舆论对美国侵略中华人民共和国的行动的注意。美国武装部队在许多年来一贯地侵犯中国的领空和领海，而中国的武装部队则没有侵犯过美国的领空和领海。
    是美国的舰队实际上封锁中国的海岸，中国的舰队并没有在旧金山或纽约附近的美国沿海一带游戈。
    美国对中华人民共和国的侵略行动和对中国内政的干涉是由来已久的事情。现在美国政府对中国人民的敌对行动只是长期以来一连串的侵略行为中的新的一环。
    人所共知，一九五○年六月二十七日美国总统命令美国第七舰队和武装部队对中国的台湾岛和其他的中国岛屿采取强制行动，并且把已遭到中国人民驱逐而盘踞在台湾和一些沿海岛屿的蒋介石匪帮置于它们的保护之下。结果美国海军对整个台湾地区建立了军事控制，而台湾则被占领而变成美国的一个军事基地。
    这样就对一个主权国家的内政进行了公然的干涉，为了破坏中华人民共和国的领土的不可侵犯性而使用了武力的威胁，而这些都是违反联合国宪章的。美利坚合众国违反了联合国宪章的重要原则之一，同时还违反了普遍公认的国际法准则。
    美国部队这些行动要阻止中国人民解放台湾，阻止他们对这个岛屿行使不能剥夺的主权。
    一九五四年十二月二日同蒋介石集团缔结的所谓“共同防御”条约，是美国对中华人民共和国的又一个侵略行为。由于朝鲜战争停止了，美国政府就没有可能再利用这个战争作为继续占领台湾的借口。因此，它企图借助这个条约来保证它对中国领土——台湾和澎湖列岛——的占领。从条约本文和杜勒斯先生发表的声明——声明中说，这个条约的签订“将会一次地、永远地消除关于美国会以某种方式同意把台湾和澎湖列岛交给共产党控制的传说和报道”——可以看出，缔结这个条约的目的是把台湾和澎湖列岛割离中国并且建立美国对这些长久以来就属于中国的领土的统治。
    值得注意的是，条约规定把它的实施范围扩大到远远超过台湾地区和澎湖列岛界限以外，扩大到如条约所指出的“经双方协议所决定”的任何领土去。这只能被认为是准备不仅在台湾地区而且在中华人民共和国领土的其他部分对中华人民共和国的新的侵略行为。
    美国的上述行动是对中华人民共和国的主权和领土完整的粗暴侵犯，从而违反了联合国宪章，特别是第二条第四款的规定，这一款说：“各会员国在其国际关系上不得使用威胁或武力，或以与联合国宗旨不符之任何其他方法，侵害任何会员国或国家之领土完整或政治独立。”
    美国的这些行动也违背了美利坚合众国根据一九四三年的开罗宣言和一九四五年的波茨坦公告所承担的义务，这些文件规定在日本投降后台湾和澎湖列岛必须归并于中国大陆。
    以上的事情说明，美国武装部队在台湾和其他中国岛屿地区的行动构成对中华人民共和国的侵略，并且是远东紧张局势的根源。同时很明显的，这些行动也危及国际和平和那个地区的安全。
    在对和平的威胁日趋严重，国际紧张局势日益加剧的时候，联合国没有权利不加过问。联合国迄今没有采取行动制止美利坚合众国的侵略行为，这就鼓励了采取走向战争的新步骤。人们不能不看到，美国国会最近关于使用美国武装部队保证所谓
  “台湾和澎湖列岛的安全”的决议、美国庞大的军事部队在中国海区域的集中和显示“力量”的示威，是对中国内政的公开干涉和对中华人民共和国的直接挑衅。
    十分明显，只有当美国停止它对中国内政的干涉并且把它的武装部队从台湾和中国其他岛屿撤退，远东的危险的国际紧张局势才能消除。
    这就说明为什么安全理事会有必要急切地审议苏联所提出的决议草案。这个决议草案规定美国立即采取步骤，以终止对中华人民共和国的侵略行为和对中国内政的干涉，立即从台湾和属于中国的其他领土撤退它的一切空、海、陆军部队。这个决议草案还规定任何一方防止在台湾地区的敌对行动以便于不属于中华人民共和国的一切武装部队从那个地区的岛屿撤退。
    我们在提出这个决议草案时深信，安全理事会通过这种决议，将不仅会实现停火，而且还会消除造成这个地区目前国际紧张局势的根源。
    苏联代表团同时建议，安全理事会邀请中华人民共和国的代表参加关于这个问题的审议。
      至于新西兰代表向安全理事会提出的关于审议在中国大陆沿海某些岛屿地区发生敌对行动的问题的建议，这个建议规避了关于消除造成远东紧张局势的根源这个最最重要的问题。
    这个建议把整个问题缩小到停火，而且仅仅是在一小群中国岛屿上实行停火。新西兰代表的信谈到在中国大陆沿海的某些岛屿的地区发生敌对行动，并且着重指出这种敌对行动据说能够危及和平和安全的维持。信中没有一句话提到对远东和平的威胁发展起来的真正原因。
      新西兰代表在一月二十八日的记者招待会上解释说，发起在安全理事会中提出这个问题的人努力要使交战双方停火。这封信没有确切说明成问题的是中国大陆沿海的哪些岛屿。但是在同一个记者招待会上，新西兰代表阐明，所指的是像他所说的
  “从大陈列岛往南并且包括金门”的沿海岛屿。他还说，这个问题对于台湾或澎湖没有任何影响。十分清楚，新西兰的建议，正像关于台湾海峡停火的
  “和事”言论一样，是同恢复远东和平的愿望毫无共同之处的。它们只有一个目的，那就是干涉中华人民共和国的内政，要求它放弃它的把美国支持下的蒋介石匪帮从它自己的领土上清除出去的主权。
    在沿海岛屿地区实行停火——这里有些人企图把这说成是一种“和平的”行为——实际上只不过是一种笨拙的阴谋，目的在于强迫中华人民共和国放弃它对长久以来一直属于中国的领土的台湾和澎湖列岛的主权和巩固美利坚合众国对这些岛屿的非法霸占。
    由于上述原因，苏联代表团反对把具有像新西兰代表提出的那样的形式和内容的项目列入安全理事会的议程。同时我们坚决主张把苏联提出的“关于美利坚合众国在中国的台湾和其他岛屿地区对中华人民共和国的侵略行为”的建议列入安全理事会的议程，并予以紧急的审议，因为这个建议的目的在于消除造成远东的另一次战争的危险的根源。
