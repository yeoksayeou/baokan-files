    The spring plowing season is approaching, and local governments are leading the broad masses of farmers in formulating annual production plans, acquiring production materials, and actively carrying out spring plowing production preparations.
    Many agricultural production cooperatives have formulated annual production plans. More than 1,800 of the over 2,000 newly established agricultural production cooperatives in Gansu Province since the beginning of winter have already formulated annual production plans. Among them, all of the more than 580 newly established agricultural production cooperatives in the Yinchuan Special District have formulated this year's production plans. In Jianping County, Shijiazhuang Special District, Hebei Province, 74 out of 81 agricultural cooperatives that underwent rectification have formulated production plans for this year. The Chinese Communist Party's Chengde County Committee in Rehe Province, through summarizing and promoting the experiences and lessons of typical agricultural production cooperatives in increasing and decreasing production, promoted the agricultural production cooperatives throughout the county to formulate production plans, starting with improving farming techniques. Currently, 30% of the county's more than 900 old and new cooperatives have formulated plans for this year. The plans all stipulate new technical measures and relatively practical production increase requirements. Old cooperatives generally plan to increase production by 15% on the basis of last year, and new cooperatives are required to increase production by more than 10% compared to before the establishment of the cooperative. In order to complete the 1955 agricultural production increase plan for the entire province, the first Jiangxi Provincial Agricultural Technology Conference formulated key agricultural technology guidance points in eight areas, including rice, cotton, oil crops, bast fiber crops, tea, horticulture, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, and agricultural tools.
    In many areas, farmers are using the funds obtained from selling surplus grain to acquire large quantities of production materials and actively prepare for spring plowing. According to incomplete statistics from Jianping, Ningcheng, and other three counties in Rehe Province, farmers purchased more than 1,780 head of draft animals such as cattle, horses, mules, and donkeys, more than 300 rubber-tired and wooden-wheeled carts, and a considerable number of other new-style agricultural tools, chemical fertilizers, pesticides, pigs, and sheep. In Ninghe County, Tianjin Special District, Hebei Province, after the rectification of fourteen agricultural production cooperatives in Xin'er Township, the members actively invested in the cooperatives. Currently, the fourteen cooperatives have used the members' investment to buy back more than 57,000 jin of manure from Tianjin, and also bought new rubber-wheeled carts, large mules, and double-wheeled double-shared plows. Supply and marketing cooperatives in the Han areas of Xikang Province have ordered a large number of agricultural tools from local handicraft production cooperatives or production groups. In the first quarter, they will supply farmers with more than 325,000 agricultural tools, an increase of two and a half times compared to the same period last year. From December of last year to the present, the People's Government of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province has transported more than 33,000 pieces of agricultural tools to various counties free of charge. The agricultural and forestry departments of Xikang Province plan to promote more than 9,200 new-style agricultural tools such as double-wheeled double-shared plows and walking plows throughout the province, as well as 300,000 jin of chemical fertilizers such as phosphate rock powder and ammonium sulfate.
    Currently, farmers in various regions are building small-scale farmland water conservancy projects and carrying out fertilizer accumulation and topdressing work. In Sichuan Province, a total of more than 2,800 mountain ponds and dikes have been built and are under construction, and topdressing has been universally applied to more than 50 million mu of spring crops. Many new cooperatives in Gansu Province have formed production teams or production groups to carry out fertilizer accumulation work. Under the leadership of agricultural production cooperatives, farmers in various parts of Rehe Province are mobilizing vehicles and horses to transport manure to the fields. 30% of the base fertilizer used during spring plowing in Chengde, Lingyuan, and other counties has already been transported to the fields. After the members of the Xigou Township Agricultural, Forestry, Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, formulated this year's grain production increase plan on the eve of the Spring Festival, the members worked hard to transport more than 3,500 dan of fertilizer that had been composted throughout the winter to the fields in order to ensure the implementation of this plan, and accumulated a lot of fertilizer in conjunction with the Spring Festival cleaning.

    广大农民积极准备春耕生产
    春耕季节已经临近，各地人民政府正在领导广大农民制订全年生产计划，添置生产资料，积极进行春耕生产准备工作。
    许多农业生产合作社订出了全年生产计划。甘肃省入冬以来新建的二千多个农业生产合作社已有一千八百多个订出了全年生产计划。其中银川专区新建的五百八十多个农业生产合作社都已全部订出今年的生产计划。河北省石家庄专区建屏县经过整顿的八十一个农业社中，有七十四个社订出了今年的生产计划。中共热河省承德县委员会通过总结、宣传典型农业生产合作社增产和减产的经验、教训，推动全县农业生产合作社从改进耕作技术着眼，制订生产计划。全县九百多个新、老社，目前已有百分之三十订出今年的生产计划。计划中都规定了新的技术措施和比较切实的增产要求。老社一般都计划要在去年基础上增产百分之十五，新社要求比建社前增产百分之十以上。为完成全省一九五五年农业增产计划，江西省首届农业技术会议订出了水稻、棉花、油料、麻类、茶叶、园艺生产、畜牧兽医和农具等八个方面的农业技术指导要点。
    不少地区农民用出卖余粮所得的款项，添置大量生产资料，积极准备春耕。热河省建平、宁城等三县不完全统计，农民买进牛、马、骡、驴等耕畜一千七百八十多头，胶轮和木轮的大车三百多辆，其他新式农具、化学肥料、农药、猪、羊等也为数不少。河北省天津专区宁河县新二乡十四个农业生产合作社经过整顿后，社员积极向社内投资，现在十四个社已用社员投资由天津买回五万七千多斤大粪，还买了新胶皮轮车、大骡子和双轮双铧犁。西康省汉族地区的供销合作社向当地手工业生产合作社或生产小组订制了大批农具，第一季度将供应农民们三十二万五千多件农具，比去年同一时期增加两倍半。西康省藏族自治区人民政府从去年十二月到现在，运到各县的无偿农具已有三万三千多件。西康省农林部门准备在全省推广双轮双铧犁、步犁等新式农具九千二百多件，磷矿粉、硫酸錏等化学肥料三十万斤。
    目前，各地农民正兴修小型农田水利，展开积肥追肥工作。四川省已经修成和正在修筑的山湾塘堰共有二千八百多口，五千多万亩小春作物已经普遍进行了中耕和追肥。甘肃省许多新社组成了生产队或生产小组，展开积肥工作。热河省各地农民在农业生产合作社带动下，正出动车马往地里送粪。承德、凌源等县春耕时施用的基肥，已有百分之三十送到地里。山西省平顺县西沟乡农林畜牧生产合作社的社员们，在春节前夕订出今年粮食增产计划后，社员们为了保证这个计划的实现，一股劲把一冬沤好的三千五百多担肥料赶运到地里，并结合春节大扫除，积了许多肥料。
