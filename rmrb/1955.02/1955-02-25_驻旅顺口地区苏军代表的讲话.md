Speech by the Soviet Representative Stationed in the Lüshunkou Area
Dear Comrades and Friends, Dear Members of the Delegation of the People's Republic of China, Dear Comrade Peng Dehuai!

Please allow me, on behalf of the Soviet Army and Navy soldiers, officers, colonels, and generals, and on behalf of their families, to express my heartfelt gratitude for your hospitality. This reception is a vivid manifestation of the pure friendship between the Soviet and Chinese peoples.

Our gathering also proves the solid combat friendship between the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Soviet Army and Navy.

Please allow me to pay warm tribute to the glorious Chinese People's Liberation Army, which has been tempered in battles.

Living in your country, we feel your kindness and friendship towards the Soviet people and the Soviet army at all times and in all places. We have learned many things and learned a lot from the great Chinese people.

We Soviet people are very happy to see and know that the talented and hardworking Chinese people, under the leadership of their glorious Communist Party, have advanced far in the cause of building a new life.

For all of this, we love the Chinese people.

We assure the delegation of the People's Republic of China, and through it, the entire Chinese people, that our friendship is eternal, and our hearts are forever with you.

Our gathering and our fruitful joint work to defend peace and security in the Far East will never be forgotten.

May the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China grow stronger every day!
