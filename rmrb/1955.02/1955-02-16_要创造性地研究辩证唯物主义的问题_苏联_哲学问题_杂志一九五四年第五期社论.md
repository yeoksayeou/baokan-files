To Creatively Study the Problems of Dialectical Materialism
--Editorial from the Soviet magazine "Problems of Philosophy," No. 5, 1954

Editor's Note: This editorial from the Soviet magazine "Problems of Philosophy" points out the shortcomings in the research work of the Soviet philosophical circles and proposes the task of further studying dialectical materialism, which is well worth our attention. The original editorial is lengthy, and some of the earlier parts and other paragraphs have been omitted here.

How exactly are our philosophers studying the problems of dialectical materialism? What is the situation in this extremely important area of our philosophy?

Undoubtedly, there have been some achievements in this regard since the philosophical discussions of 1947. Some work has been done in popularizing dialectical materialism, struggles have been waged to expose the latest idealist factions of bourgeois philosophy, and the philosophical problems of natural science have been discussed. However, all of this is far from sufficient and falls short of the task of further studying dialectical materialism when viewed from the demands that communist construction and the development of science place upon philosophy.

It must be frankly admitted that our work is still being done very poorly, and the research on the problems of dialectical materialism is the most barren and backward area.

The editorial "To Creatively Study Marxist-Leninist Theory" in the "Communist" magazine, No. 14, 1954, justly pointed out the serious shortcomings of our philosophers in studying the entire issue of Marxist-Leninist dialectics (including dialectical logic, the categories of materialist dialectics, and epistemology).

Precisely because work in this area has been done poorly, expressing a passive attitude, many major errors have been made in practical propaganda work and in many works discussing important theoretical issues. For example, what else could the voluntaristic errors made in interpreting the objective economic laws operating under the socialist system be attributed to, if not to an indifferent attitude towards the problems of dialectical materialism? Philosophers bear the primary responsibility for these errors. In our philosophical circles, there has never been a specialized treatise or a decent work on such an important issue as the dialectical materialist doctrine on laws.

When we deny that the universal law of the unity and struggle of opposites also applies to the socialist productive forces and relations of production, is it not due to indifference and poor research on the problems of dialectical materialism that confusion has long existed on the issue of contradictions in the development of the socialist mode of production? Here is manifested a fundamental shortcoming of our philosophical work, which is its weak connection with the practice of communist construction.

The denial of the regularity of contradictions between the two aspects of the socialist mode of production is largely due to the failure to study how this general sociological regularity functions under the new historical conditions after the victory of socialism. Some people believe that acknowledging the regularity of contradictions between the productive forces and the relations of production seems to imply acknowledging the inevitability of conflict between the two under the socialist system, as in bourgeois society. This view is detached from socialist practice, because socialist practice, under the new conditions, greatly changes the function of the general law, preventing contradictions from escalating to opposition and conflict.

This confusion exposes the weakness in our research on the fundamental problems of the dialectical method. We often quote Lenin's famous saying that the unity and struggle of opposites is the "core" of dialectics, but to this day, there is still no scientific work dedicated to this significant and very interesting issue. We often regard the concept of "contradiction" as something that is always the same, indistinguishable, and static. However, in practical life, contradictions are developing, they have different stages of development, different stages of tension and growth, and therefore it is necessary to distinguish between concepts such as "difference," "contradiction," and "opposition." As Stalin pointed out in "Economic Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R.," taking into account the multifaceted nature of contradictions is crucial to understanding that, unlike capitalism, under the socialist system there is no longer opposition between city and countryside, between manual and mental labor; what is preserved are only significant differences between them, which will become simple, insignificant differences under communism.

These examples show how close the connection is between seemingly "abstract" problems of methodology and epistemology and the practical problems of communist construction.

It is precisely because of the lack of due attention to the study of dialectical materialism that confusing and erroneous views have arisen regarding the term "unity of opposites." The editorial board of this journal is also responsible for this confusion. The denial of the concept of "unity of opposites" has led to the incorrect idea that there is no unity between the opposing aspects of a whole. In fact, without such unity and interrelation, there is no and cannot be opposing, that is, developing struggle. Lenin especially emphasized studying this issue in his "Philosophical Notebooks," where he used the concept of "unity of opposites." Of course, this is not to say that other concepts cannot be used to express the internal connection of the contradictory sides. For example, Engels spoke of "mutual penetration of opposites," and Marx spoke of "mutual opposition," and so on. However, the fully justified philosophical concept is "unity of opposites," provided that the concept of unity is not interpreted in the sense of harmonization of opposites.

Philosophical workers bear a considerable responsibility for the emergence and spread of the fashionable "theory of non-conflict." Many philosophical papers promoted the anti-Leninist idea that under the conditions of Soviet socialist society, the old can be replaced by the new "smoothly," as if the dying old things are not obstacles to development, and so on. The emergence of such views is also due to the lack of due attention paid by philosophers to the study of how contradictions function and are overcome under socialism.

The Party exposed the erroneousness and harmfulness of the "theory of non-conflict" and demanded that writers and playwrights mercilessly criticize the negative phenomena in our reality and boldly expose the real conflicts between the old and the new in our development process. At every stage of socialist construction, the Communist Party has called on us to boldly expose the contradictions in the development of Soviet society, because without knowing these contradictions, we cannot struggle to overcome them successfully. At the philosophical discussions of 1947, philosophers were blamed for being too timid to talk about these contradictions. Philosophers can and must (this is their minimum responsibility) create works discussing the essence of conflicts under socialist society, helping writers to study this issue and avoid the errors that have occurred in many past works.

In our country, the exploiting classes have been eliminated, and under the guidance of correct policies, there is no and cannot be class conflict. However, here we may and already have conflicts between advanced and backward elements of society, conflicts between the whole of society and individuals or a minority of people (whose capitalist remnants in their minds are still very deep)—bureaucrats, nationalists, those who waste the people's property, sycophants, and those who covet fame and fortune.

But it must be taken into account that to correctly point out such conflicts, it is necessary not only to expose one aspect of the contradiction, that is, the negative, obstructing side of development, but also to expose the other aspect of the contradiction, that is, the positive side, which opposes the former and constantly gains victory. This aspect must dominate our reality and will be supported by the full authority and strength of the Soviet government and the Party. Attempts to describe conflicts one-sidedly, pointing out only the negative things, are contrary to the spirit of dialectics. This kind of attempt is the theory of non-conflict, only turning the problem upside down.

These issues are becoming more relevant because of the upcoming Second All-Union Congress of Writers (translator's note: this congress has recently taken place). This congress is a major event on our ideological front and in the development of Soviet socialist culture. Soviet writers, fulfilling the important responsibility of being engineers of the human soul, have created many excellent works that have won the praise of the people. The tasks facing Soviet writers are arduous. Philosophers should help Soviet art and literature study and solve many important theoretical problems of socialist realism, and help it master the Marxist worldview, which is the powerful force for writers to correctly reflect our reality.

Gorky taught Soviet writers that the main task of socialist realism is to inspire a revolutionary worldview. Philosophers can and should give great help to writers in solving this task of Soviet literature. As indicated by the errors in the "New World" magazine, this is necessary because, up to now, in explaining some important issues of Soviet literature, there are still subjective and formalistic tendencies incompatible with Marxist philosophy.

The fact that philosophers have adopted a neutral attitude, standing idly by, towards the disputes in many departments of natural science is due to the fact that no one cares about the research on the problems of dialectical materialism. We have not done enough and have done poorly in helping natural scientists to philosophically understand the pressing problems of natural science, and we have not constantly connected dialectical materialism with natural science; this connection was clearly stated by Lenin in "On the Significance of Militant Materialism," and this connection is of great significance to both sides.

The following facts can prove this. It is known that recently, a discussion on the issue of speciation has unfolded among biologists. Undoubtedly, this discussion on one of the fundamental issues of biology is beneficial. The focus of the debate is on issues such as how to understand the process of qualitative change of species and what the forms of qualitative change and transformation of species are. The issues also include: the issue of leaps in the organic world and the nature of leaps, the issue of intra-species contradictions and inter-species contradictions, and so on.

Obviously, philosophers who have mastered the dialectical materialist method are able to and should vigorously assist biologists. This is particularly necessary because the discussions have exposed some obviously incorrect views on certain philosophical issues, especially in explaining the essence of qualitative change and leaps in the organic world. Some people equated qualitative change and leaps in the organic world only with one of their forms, that is, the form of slow, gradual change, and called any other form "non-dialectical." Conversely, another group of people regarded any view of the gradualness of qualitative change in the biological world as "metaphysical evolutionism," believing that only faster forms of change are the only dialectical forms. Neither side touched upon the idea of the diversity of forms of qualitative change in nature.

Of course, philosophy cannot replace concrete biological analysis, because only the latter can and must show the nature of these or those qualitative transformation forms in the animal and plant kingdoms. However, there is no doubt that the participation of philosophers in the discussion will help solve the controversial issues in biology. But they remained silent and stood idly by, which is intolerable. At the same time, it should also be mentioned that this journal has a lukewarm attitude towards this issue and has not actually expressed any opinion on the discussion.

Another intolerable shortcoming in our work is the insufficient emphasis on the problems of dialectical materialist epistemology. However, the problem of epistemology is the central issue in the development of modern science. It should be pointed out that for decades, especially today, idealists have been opposing dialectical materialism primarily from the perspective of epistemology. Lenin pointed out this fact in "Materialism and Empirio-criticism" and stated that idealist philosophy specializes in making trouble in epistemology. Modern bourgeois philosophy attempts to revive idealism through epistemological processing of scientific materials, bewildering natural scientists and leading them away from the only scientific materialist epistemology.

This makes it incumbent upon us Marxists to continuously expose the modern forms of idealist epistemology and agnosticism, and to deeply study dialectical materialist epistemology based on new scientific materials and the experience of social life.

The fact that we do not have a complete textbook on dialectical materialism so far is a serious backward phenomenon in our research on dialectical materialism. The Institute of Philosophy of the Soviet Academy of Sciences should bear the main responsibility for this. Only recently did the institute publish a "Dialectical Materialism." This textbook is helpful to those who study dialectical materialism. However, as pointed out by many teaching and research sections in higher education institutions during discussions of this book, it still has many serious shortcomings and cannot be considered a complete textbook on dialectical materialism. All personnel of the Institute of Philosophy should and should have written a complete textbook on dialectical materialism for our young students and the large number of Soviet intellectual cadres a long time ago.

Therefore, even a slight analysis of the state of research on the problems of dialectical materialism will clearly reveal the backward phenomenon in this very important department of philosophy. And what exactly are the reasons for this backwardness?

Among these reasons, a fairly important, or even the main, role is played by the view prevailing among some philosophical workers: it seems that studying the problems of dialectical materialism is "unrealistic," as if these problems are somewhat "impractical," "abstract and empty," and not closely related to the urgent tasks of socialist construction. It is difficult to imagine anything more absurd and harmful than this kind of view. This kind of nonsense must be eliminated forever. There is no need to prove that no matter how "abstract and empty" certain problems of dialectical materialism—such as the historical and logical things in the process of cognition, or analysis and synthesis, abstract and concrete things, induction and deduction, etc.—may sound, all these problems are actually realistic problems, because they enable our cadres to correctly deal with various phenomena in reality, and thus can correctly carry out their practical activities.

The uneradicated dogmatism in determining the scope of the main problems to be studied and in the attitude to solving these problems is a huge obstacle to bold scientific research on the problems of dialectical materialism. The problems of dialectical methods and materialist theory have not been studied in all their complexity and multifacetedness. The style of citing too many quotations is still quite common in some papers and pamphlets. In explaining the great significance of dialectical materialism to social practice, there are often narrow "pragmatic" sermons, reducing theory to a sum of examples. We also rarely conduct creative debates and discussions on pressing issues of dialectical materialism. We are still afraid to exchange opinions and argue about different opinions on philosophical issues.

It can be seen that the reason why scientific work in dialectical materialism is lagging behind is because the philosophical research departments and teaching and research sections lack due attention to this work, because of the existence of dogmatism, and because they dare not boldly and sharply raise new issues. Another important reason for this backwardness is that we have not deeply studied Lenin's philosophical legacy and have not properly implemented Lenin's instructions, which are of paramount importance for further developing dialectical materialism. Our task is to resolutely overcome this intolerable backward situation and strive to improve the scientific research work on the problems of dialectical materialism in the near future.

× × ×

What guidelines should be followed in our work? What are the important issues in dialectical materialism that urgently need to be studied?

The primary task here is to study this question: Under the new conditions, that is, under the conditions of Soviet socialist society and under the conditions of people's democratic countries, what new forms of expression and forms of action do the general laws of dialectical development have? Studying this issue is of great significance for arming cadres engaged in communist construction with knowledge of how to successfully carry out practical activities. At the same time, it must be noted Lenin's instruction: it is very important to study dialectics based on the modern history of capitalism and the experience of revolutionary movements.

Marxism-Leninism requires us to understand: general laws of development will not have the same manifestations under various historical conditions, and their manifestations and functions are different under different conditions. We must not forget for a minute Engels' famous instruction: Dialectical materialism is not a method of proving ready-made truths, but a method of research that must conduct specific analysis of specific historical situations.

No general law of dialectical development functions in exactly the same way under socialism as it does under the rule of antagonistic exploitative social formations. The same applies to laws such as the development through the struggle of opposites, the transformation of quantitative change into qualitative change, and so on.

Secondly, Marxism requires us to take into account that, in addition to the general laws that function in all social formations, although with different manifestations, there are also special laws that manifest the essence of each particular social formation. Therefore, it is urgent to study the issues of the Marxist view of laws, the objective nature of laws, general laws and special laws, and the particularity of the function of economic laws under the socialist system (which has eliminated spontaneity, unlike the economic laws under the capitalist system) in specialized scientific works and papers. At the same time, it requires cadres engaged in communist construction to master objective laws and consciously apply these laws in their practical activities.

Particular attention must be paid to studying the nature of contradictions in socialist society, which are different from the contradictions in bourgeois society. The confusion that still exists on this issue must be clarified. To achieve success in studying this important philosophical issue with great practical significance, will mostly depend on the degree of close connection between scientific research and the study of real-life processes. Of course, this also applies to the study of all other philosophical issues.

The Soviet economy has entered a new stage of upswing and comprehensive development. The recent plenary sessions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have formulated major measures in their resolutions to overcome the backwardness of the consumer goods production sectors and the agricultural sectors, and pointed out the path for further developing the socialist economy. Only by paying attention to studying these resolutions and the actual economic processes can useful philosophical generalizations be made.

The Communist Party attaches great importance to criticism and self-criticism, this form of struggle of the new against the old in Soviet society. Criticism and self-criticism are important methods for exposing and overcoming contradictions in development. Although our philosophers have talked a lot about this new form of struggle and overcoming of contradictions in Soviet society, we have not yet written a scientific philosophical work to discuss this issue, which is of great significance for understanding the new forms in which general dialectical laws function under socialism. Studying this issue is also very important for communist education and for combating the remnants of capitalism in people's minds.

In the work of publicizing and studying scientific issues of dialectical materialism, not enough emphasis has been placed on the material analysis of the laws of development of our society. Therefore, errors often occur when explaining a series of practical problems of communist construction: for example, failure to understand the decisive role of material conditions in solving these or those problems of social development, skipping development stages that have not yet been passed through, and empty discussions divorced from reality. It is precisely because of this methodological shortcoming, because of the lack of skill in materially analyzing the pressing problems of communist construction, that some propagandists regard the issue of product exchange as a problem of today, and underestimate the huge, yet-to-be-tapped potential of the collective farm ownership system.

We must use the excellent examples of Marxist-Leninist classics in materially handling social life phenomena, the examples of Party resolutions, and educate our cadres in the spirit of being good at calmly and realistically analyzing situations. The resolutions of the September, February-March, and June plenary sessions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union are brilliant examples of such profound, calm, and material analysis.

Studying the issue of the characteristics of the function and manifestation of general dialectical laws under socialist social conditions must be closely linked to the study of theoretical problems of the Marxist-Leninist method and epistemological problems. The insufficient study of many aspects of the dialectical method and epistemology, as we pointed out using the problem of the contradiction between productive forces and relations of production under the socialist system as an example, has hindered the analysis of the pressing problems of communist construction.

The fact that philosophers have often focused their efforts only on studying the four characteristics of the dialectical method or the three characteristics of materialist theory must also be overcome. It should be taken into account that the task of Stalin's "Dialectical and Historical Materialism" is only to explain the basic characteristics of materialist dialectics, the materialist theory of the world, and epistemology in an easy-to-understand form. The four characteristics of dialectics pointed out in this book do not yet include all the wealth and all aspects of the Marxist method.

Lenin, in "On the Significance of Militant Materialism," asked us to study all aspects of dialectics. In "Philosophical Notebooks," he drafted sixteen elements of dialectics. Lenin included many categories of materialist dialectics in these elements. Lenin called categories the "central" supporting points of cognition. For example, the extremely important categories of dialectical materialism—content and form, cause and effect, accident and necessity, essence and phenomenon, possibility and reality, and so on—are such categories. Lenin and Stalin have done profound research on many of the above-mentioned categories in their works.

However, in recent years, almost no one has studied the categories of dialectics. Even among some philosophers, there is a ridiculous and fundamentally erroneous view: it seems that in order to avoid falling into the danger of "Hegelianism" and sophistry, one should not study the categories of dialectical logic and all of dialectical logic. This shortcoming is also manifested in the philosophy teaching syllabus of higher education institutions. There is no basis for impoverishing materialist dialectics in this way. The current task is to study dialectics from all its complexity and multifacetedness. Specialized works and papers on the categories of dialectics must be written in the near future, elucidating all the significance of these categories for cognition and practical activities.

Materialist dialectics is a complete, living, and creatively developing science. It was precisely because Plekhanov did not understand this that Lenin blamed him, pointing out that Plekhanov reduced dialectics to a pile of examples, without paying attention to studying it as a philosophy. Lenin's criticism of Plekhanov should not be understood as meaning that examples are not needed when explaining philosophical issues. Without examples, no science can stand. Lenin's meaning in the blame is that Plekhanov, while citing many examples, limited himself to explaining individual principles of dialectics, rather than studying dialectics as a scientific system of laws, categories, and concepts (which reflect the objective world and give us a powerful tool for cognition and revolutionary practice).

Lenin put forward the task of studying the structure of the science of materialist dialectics: studying and developing all the dialectical factors, laws, and categories in this science as a unified and interconnected whole.

Lenin also criticized Plekhanov for not understanding that dialectics is logic and epistemology. However, without this aspect (which Lenin called the "essence" of the matter), there is no philosophy of dialectics.

Even now, some people have not sufficiently estimated the profound significance of Lenin's instruction on the unity of dialectics, logic, and epistemology, and the tasks for studying the problems of dialectical materialism that arise from this instruction. Lenin's principle of the unity of dialectics, logic, and epistemology shows that Marxism has overcome the separation between the laws of the objective world and the laws of cognition, between the content and form of cognition, and between the real world and logical thinking, which is the characteristic of idealist philosophy. Dialectics, on the one hand, provides us with the only correct doctrine on the most general objective laws of reality development, and at the same time, it is the only scientific epistemology and logic. Since this is the case (and must be the case), then our task is not only to completely study objective dialectics, but also to study the dialectics of logical thinking and the dialectics of cognition.

Lenin's "Philosophical Notebooks" contains an inexhaustible wealth of ideas on these issues. In his commentary, Lenin drafted a huge program for studying Marxist dialectical logic, formulated the method for studying it, and pointed out the branches of knowledge that must be based on in studying dialectical materialist epistemology.

The following instructions contained in the "Philosophical Notebooks" are of inestimable guiding significance for further studying these problems: In order to create a correct dialectical materialist epistemology, it is necessary to trace the history of all sciences, study the history of the intellectual development of children and animals, as well as the history of the development of language, etc., study the interrelationship between the historical process of cognition and the laws of thinking, and study the dialectical nature of concepts, judgments, reasoning, etc.

Each of the above-mentioned instructions of Lenin is the object to be studied by philosophical works on dialectical materialism. Now is the time to start solving this arduous and very important task. It was pointed out at the philosophical discussions that we are staying in the work of popularization. There is no need to prove that the work of popularizing dialectical materialism will still be needed in the future. And we must strive to strengthen this work, because this work cannot yet meet the huge needs of the Soviet people who are eager to study Marxist-Leninist philosophy.

At the same time, we must seriously study the complex and practically significant academic issues of dialectical materialism. In philosophy, as in any science, it is not permissible to express fear and timidity in the face of major and difficult problems. There will inevitably be difficulties on this road, but we should move forward bravely in the face of these difficulties, instead of retreating and stopping. The urgency of this work can be seen from the debates about where this or that category should be placed, what logic is, or, as Engels said, what the subordination and order of the various categories should be. Obviously, only by studying the system of Marxist dialectical logic can this question and similar questions be answered.

We have almost completely neglected such important problems of dialectical logic and epistemology as the historical and logical things, abstract and concrete things, and the interrelationship between essence and phenomenon in the process of cognition. We have not studied methods of cognition such as analysis and synthesis, induction and deduction. However, all of these are of great significance for understanding the process, path, and method of cognition, as well as for carrying out successful practical activities. Studying these problems of logic and epistemology can arm our young students and cadres with knowledge of how to understand the surrounding world. This kind of research is also of great significance to natural scientists.

Lenin reminded us not to simplify the process of reflection of objective reality in the human mind, and pointed out that the full complexity and contradiction of this reflection must be studied. This is the problem of studying dialectics and the logic of cognition. We must carry out this research with all our enthusiasm.

The philosophers who study the problems of dialectical materialism face major tasks. It is necessary to generalize new materials of natural science, estimate the achievements of science, so as to further creatively develop Marxist philosophy. During this period after the publication of "Materialism and Empirio-criticism," the development process of natural science has fully confirmed Lenin's prediction: modern natural science gives birth to dialectical materialism. This is a very complex and painful road, especially in capitalist countries, because there the bourgeois ideology and countless disguised philosophical idealism dominate.

However, the birth process of dialectical materialism in natural science is forward and unstoppable, because, as Engels pointed out long ago, dialectics is absolutely necessary for natural scientists. The examples of outstanding scholars such as Langevin, Joliot-Curie, and Bernal clearly prove this. Langevin admitted that he has been able to understand the history of physics in recent decades only by relying on dialectical materialism. Our magazine's fourth issue published a paper by the famous French physicist Louis de Broglie, who refuted the muddled ideas of indeterminism in physics.

Soviet scholars consciously grasp the dialectical materialist worldview and constantly achieve great achievements in their work. However, it should not be forgotten that the process of mastering the Marxist method is also complex here. There are still remnants of idealist and metaphysical views in Soviet science, and Soviet science cannot guarantee to be free from the influence of that idealism that we must strive to overcome.

Therefore, philosophers have a dual task in this regard. First, we must consistently and systematically wage a resolute struggle to oppose the spread of idealism in natural science, and to oppose the bourgeois philosophy that attempts to use scientific and technological achievements to preserve and save idealism. However, we must be good at carrying out this struggle. Do not forget that many foreign scholars often express and explain these or those achievements of natural science idealistically. This is because idealist philosophy dominates in capitalist countries. Therefore, discarding the valuable things obtained by science on the pretext of fighting against idealism is contrary to the spirit of Marxism-Leninism. This tendency also exists in some articles published in our magazine discussing the issue of relativity. In this case, we must follow Lenin's wise instructions: when evaluating these or those natural scientific theories, we must remove its dross, retain its essence, and explain it from the perspective of dialectical materialism.

Second, philosophers must vigorously help scientists elucidate a series of concepts and theories put forward by the development of modern science. For example, physicists face a difficult task: analyzing concepts such as mass, energy, nuclear charge, space and time, dynamic and statistical regularity, intermittent and non-intermittent things, and many other concepts from a modern perspective. The concepts listed above show that this task cannot be solved without the help of dialectical materialist philosophy. At the same time, it must be remembered that this does not mean that philosophers must solve specific physical tasks or other tasks and must replace the work of scientists. As Professor Bernal clearly pointed out, dialectics and dialectical materialism only complete strategic tasks, point scientists to the right path and methods to solve the problems they face, and help them think correctly about their work from the only scientific philosophical point of view.

At the same time, it must be particularly emphasized that Soviet natural scientists—physicists, biologists, chemists, astronomers, etc.—themselves can and must more boldly and resolutely connect philosophy with natural science and make philosophical generalizations of modern scientific discoveries. In the era of Soviet power, our scientists have undergone great training in mastering the only scientific worldview—dialectical materialism. Most of the scientists who have achieved great success in scientific work now are graduates of Soviet higher education institutions that pay special attention to the study of Marxist-Leninist philosophy. Therefore, our scientists should fully arm themselves so that they can skillfully solve the philosophical problems in modern natural science.

The outstanding Soviet scientist S. Vavilov consistently attached importance to the philosophical problems of natural science and did a lot of work in philosophically analyzing new scientific materials. He justly blamed our natural scientists for lacking due concern in this regard. When talking about the huge tasks in the methodological aspects of physics, he pointed out that this work "physicists cannot at all push off to philosophers, but should complete themselves, preferably in close cooperation with philosophers."

The achievements of modern natural science require philosophers to do more work in deeply studying a series of philosophical concepts, categories, and principles in order to further develop dialectical materialism. For example, specialized works on matter, the form of matter, matter and movement, the form of matter movement, space and time, matter and consciousness, etc., must be written based on the achievements of science. Of course, this work requires philosophers to seriously and deeply study natural science.

It cannot be required that every philosopher knows all the complex and particularly specialized knowledge of natural science. However, it can and should be required that philosophers specialize in these or those aspects of science. The casual attitude that still exists in our philosophical investigation of natural science problems is intolerable. Just analyzing the topics defended in various academic research institutions will show that we still rarely guide our young people who study philosophy to specialize in individual departments of natural science. There are still few philosophers here who study physics, biology, cosmology, mathematics, etc. We must more actively and boldly promote young people who graduate from natural science schools to philosophical research departments. It should be noted that without eliminating this shortcoming in our work, we cannot undertake the arduous task of making philosophical generalizations of the latest materials of natural science.

Finally, it should also be pointed out a task of studying and promoting Marxist atheism, and some issues related to opposing religion and superstition. Lenin put this task in the first place in "On the Tasks of Militant Materialism." Our philosophers have poorly implemented this important instruction of Lenin. Dialectical materialist philosophy provides us with a powerful weapon against religious prejudice and religious deception. The task here is not only to explain these issues in popular terms, but also to put forward the issues in Marxist-Leninist atheism that should be studied.

Of course, what has been said above does not include all the tasks in further studying dialectical materialism. However, this is enough to understand the complexity, arduousness, and the great responsibility of the tasks we face. The Party teaches us not to be afraid of complex and arduous theoretical tasks and sets an example for us in creatively solving these tasks. In the process of studying complex theoretical problems, it is inevitable to make this or that mistake. However, not raising and solving these problems because of this is contrary to the spirit of Bolshevism. Mistakes can and must be corrected on the basis of carrying out creative and fruitful discussions and through comradely exchanges of opinions.

In short, we must study the problems of dialectical materialism seriously, bravely, and creatively.

    要创造性地研究辩证唯物主义的问题
    ——苏联“哲学问题”杂志一九五四年第五期社论
    编者按：苏联“哲学问题”杂志的这一篇社论，指出了苏联哲学界研究工作中的缺点，提出了哲学界进一步研究辩证唯物主义的任务，十分值得我们重视。社论原文较长，这里略去了前面的一部分和其他若干段落。
    我们的哲学家究竟是在怎样研究辩证唯物主义的问题呢？我们哲学的这一极重要的部门的情况是怎样的呢？
    毫无疑问，自一九四七年的哲学讨论会之后，在这方面是有一些成绩的。在普及辩证唯物主义方面做了一定的工作，在揭穿资产阶级哲学的最新的唯心派别方面进行了斗争，讨论了自然科学的哲学问题。但是，所有这些，如果从共产主义建设、科学的发展向哲学所提出的要求看来，和进一步研究辩证唯物主义的任务相比，还是非常不够的。
    应该坦率地承认，我们的工作还做得很差，辩证唯物主义问题的研究工作，是最荒芜最落后的一个部门。
    “共产党人”杂志一九五四年第十四期的社论“要创造性地研究马克思列宁主义理论”，十分公正地指出了我们哲学家在研究整个马克思列宁主义辩证法问题（其中包括辩证逻辑问题、唯物辩证法范畴问题、认识论问题）方面的严重缺点。
    正因为在这方面的工作做得不好，表现了消极态度，所以在实际宣传工作和许多有关论述重要理论问题的著作中犯了不少重大的错误。例如，在解释社会主义制度下起着作用的客观经济规律时所犯的唯意志论的错误，如果不是由于对辩证唯物主义问题采取了漠不关心的态度，那末又是由于什么呢？哲学家首先要对这些错误负责。在我们哲学界，从来没有出现过一部像辩证唯物主义关于规律的学说这类重要问题的专门论著和像样的著作。
    当我们否认了对立的统一和斗争这一普遍规律的作用也适用于社会主义的生产力和生产关系的时候，在社会主义生产方式发展中的矛盾问题上长期存在着混乱现象，难道这不是由于对辩证唯物主义问题采取漠视态度和研究很差而造成的吗？在这里表现了我们哲学工作的一个根本缺点，就是与共产主义建设的实践联系很少。
    否认社会主义生产方式的两个方面产生矛盾的规律性，在颇大的程度上正是因为没有研究这个一般的社会学的规律性在社会主义胜利后的新的历史条件下是怎样发生作用的问题所致。有人认为，承认生产力和生产关系之间矛盾的规律性，似乎就等于承认两者在社会主义制度下的冲突的不可避免性，就像资产阶级社会那样。这种看法是脱离社会主义实践的，因为社会主义实践在新的条件下大大地改变了一般规律的作用，不会把矛盾弄到对立和冲突的地步。
    这种混乱现象暴露了我们在研究辩证方法的根本问题方面的弱点。我们经常引用列宁的名言：对立的统一和斗争是辩证法的“核心”，但是，到现在还没有一部专门论述这一重大而非常有意思的问题的科学著作。我们常常把“矛盾”这一概念看成某种始终一样的、不能区分的、静止不变的概念，然而在实践生活中矛盾是在发展着的，它有它的发展的不同阶段，有它的紧张、增长的不同阶段，因而也就必须把“差别”、“矛盾”、“对立”等这样一些概念区别开来。正如斯大林在“苏联社会主义经济问题”一书中指出的，估计到矛盾的多面性，对于了解下述情况是非常重要的：与资本主义不同，在社会主义制度下已经不存在城市和乡村间、体力劳动和脑力劳动间的对立，所保存的只是它们之间的重大差别，这种差别在共产主义制度下将变成简单的、不重要的差别。
    这些例子表明，在认识方法和认识论的一些看来是“抽象”的问题与共产主义建设实践的一些现实问题之间，有着多么密切的联系。
    只因对辩证唯物主义问题的研究缺乏应有的重视，所以才在“对立的统一”这个术语上产生了混乱的错误的看法。对于这种混乱的看法本刊编辑部也是要负责的。由于否认“对立的统一”这个概念，就产生了不正确的观念，好像在整体的对立方面之间没有统一，其实，如果没有这种统一和相互联系，就没有而且也不可能有对立的、即发展的斗争。列宁在“哲学笔记”中特别重视研究这个问题，他在这里使用了“对立的统一”这个概念。当然，这并不是说，为了表明矛盾双方的内在联系就不可以利用其他概念。例如，恩格斯就曾说过“对立的相互渗透”，马克思说过“相互对立”，等等。但是，完全合理的哲学概念则是“对立的统一”，当然，不能在对立的调和这种意义上来解释统一这一概念。
    哲学工作者对于标榜一时的“无冲突论”的产生和传播，要负不小的责任。在许多哲学论文中宣传了反列宁主义的思想：好像在苏维埃社会主义社会的条件下，旧东西可以由新东西“一帆风顺”地来代替，好像垂死的旧东西不是发展的障碍，等等。这类观点之所以会产生，同样是由于哲学家对社会主义条件下矛盾如何发生作用和被克服这个问题的研究缺乏应有的重视。
    党揭穿了“无冲突论”的错误性和危害性，要求作家和剧作家无情地批评我们现实中的反面现象，大胆地揭发我国发展进程中新旧之间的实在冲突。共产党在社会主义建设的各个阶段上都号召我们大胆地揭露苏维埃社会发展中的矛盾，因为不知道这些矛盾，就不能为顺利克服这些矛盾而斗争。在一九四七年的哲学讨论会上曾责备哲学家们，说他们由于胆怯而不敢谈论这些矛盾。哲学家能够而且必须（这是他们的起码的责任）创造出论述社会主义社会条件下冲突的实质的著作，帮助作家们研究这个问题，使他们避免过去许多作品中所发生的错误。
    在我国，剥削阶级已被消灭，在正确政策的指导下，没有而且也不可能有阶级间的冲突。但是，在我们这里可能有而且已经有社会先进人物和落后分子之间的冲突，整个社会和个别人或少数人（他们意识中的资本主义余毒还很深）——官僚主义者、民族主义者、浪费人民财产的人、阿谀奉迎的人、贪图名利的人——之间的冲突。
    但是必须估计到，要正确地指出这种冲突，不仅要揭发矛盾的一个方面，即反面的阻碍发展的一面，而且要揭发矛盾的另一方面，即正面的、反对前者并不断获得胜利的一面，这一方面必然在我们的现实中占主导地位，并且会得到苏联政府和党的全部权威和实力的支持。企图片面地描写冲突，只指出反面东西，是违反辩证法的精神的，这种企图也就是无冲突论，只不过是把问题反过来而已。
    这些问题由于即将召开第二次全苏作家代表大会（译者按：这个代表大会最近已经开过了。）而更加具有现实意义，这次代表大会是我们思想战线上和苏维埃社会主义文化发展中的重大事件。苏联作家履行着人类灵魂工程师的重要职责，他们创作了许多博得人民称许的优秀作品。苏联作家面临的任务是艰巨的。哲学家应当帮助苏联艺术文学研究和解决社会主义现实主义的许多重要的理论问题，帮助它掌握马克思主义的世界观，这种世界观是作家正确反映我们现实的强大力量。
    高尔基曾教导苏联作家，社会主义现实主义的主要任务就是激发革命的世界观。在解决苏联文学的这项任务中，哲学家可以并且应该给作家们以大力的帮助。这之所以需要，正如“新世界”杂志的错误所表明的，是因为直到目前为止，在阐述苏联文学的一些重要问题时，还有与马克思主义哲学不相容的主观主义和形式主义的趋向。
    哲学家对许多自然科学部门所发生的意见争论采取袖手旁观的中立态度，不是因为别的原因，而是由于对辩证唯物主义问题的研究无人过问。我们在帮助自然科学家从哲学上来理解自然科学的一些迫切问题方面还做得很不够而且也很差，还没有经常地把辩证唯物主义和自然科学联系起来；这种联系列宁在“论战斗唯物主义的意义”一文中曾明确地谈到，而且这种联系对于双方都有非常重要的意义。
    下述事实可以证明这一点。大家知道，最近在生物学家中间展开了关于物种形成问题的讨论。无疑地，这种关于生物学的根本问题之一的讨论是有益处的。争论的焦点是这样一些问题，如，怎样理解物种的质变过程，物种的质变和转化的形式是怎样的。争论的问题还有：关于有机界的飞跃和飞跃的性质问题，关于种内矛盾和种间矛盾的问题等等。
    显然，掌握了辩证唯物主义方法的哲学家是能够而且应该大力帮助生物学家的。它所以特别需要，是因为讨论会在某些哲学问题上、尤其是在解释生物界的质变、飞跃的本质问题时暴露了一些显然不正确的观点。一部分人把有机界的质变、飞跃只同它们的一种形式即缓慢的逐渐的变化形式看成一回事，而把其他任何形式都说成是“非辩证的”。相反地，另一部分人则把关于生物界质变的渐进性的任何见解都说成是“形而上学的进化论”，认为只有较快的变化形式才是唯一辩证的形式。两方面都没有接触到自然界质变形式的多样性的思想。
    当然，哲学不能代替具体的生物学上的分析，因为只有后者才能够而且必须表明动植物界这些或那些质的转化形式的性质。但是，毫无疑问，哲学家参加讨论，对于解决生物学中的争论问题是会有所帮助的。可是他们却保持缄默，袖手旁观，这是不能容忍的。同时也应当谈到本刊对这个问题所持的冷淡态度，实际上对讨论会没有发表任何意见。
    我们工作中还有一个不可容忍的缺点，就是对于辩证唯物主义认识论的问题重视得不够。然而，认识论问题却是现代科学发展的中心问题。应该指出，好几十年以来，特别是在我们今天，唯心主义者首先是从认识论方面来反对辩证唯物主义的。列宁曾在“唯物主义与经验批判主义”一书中指出这一事实，并且谈到，唯心主义哲学专在认识论上捣鬼。现代资产阶级哲学企图通过对科学材料进行认识论的加工而使唯心主义死灰复燃，使自然科学家不知所从，使他们离开唯一科学的唯物主义的认识论。
    这就责成我们马克思主义者要不断地揭穿现代唯心主义的认识论和不可知论的现代形式，要根据新的科学材料和社会生活的经验来深入地研究辩证唯物主义的认识论。
    直到目前，我们还没有一本完善的辩证唯物主义教科书，这一事实是我们研究辩证唯物主义问题方面的一种严重的落后现象。对这一点，苏联科学院哲学研究所应负主要责任。只是在不久以前研究所才出版了一本“辩证唯物主义”。这本教材对于学习辩证唯物主义的人是有一定帮助的。但是，正像许多高等学校教研室在讨论本书时所指出的，它还有不少严重的缺点，不能算做一本完善的辩证唯物主义教科书。哲学研究所的全体人员应该而且早就应该给我们的青年学生和大量的苏联知识分子干部编写一本完善的辩证唯物主义教科书。
    因此，甚至稍微分析一下研究辩证唯物主义问题的状况，就会清楚地看出哲学这一非常重要的部门的落后现象。而这种落后的原因究竟在哪里呢？
    在这些原因中占相当重要的、甚至可以说占主要地位的就是在一部分哲学工作者中间流行着一种观点：似乎研究辩证唯物主义问题“不现实”，好像这些问题有些“不切实际”，“抽象空洞”，与社会主义建设的迫切任务联系不大。很难令人设想还有什么比这类的观点更荒谬更有害的看法了。必须永远消除这种无稽之谈。无需证明，不管辩证唯物主义的哪些问题——如认识过程中的历史东西和逻辑东西的问题，或是分析和综合、抽象东西和具体东西、归纳和演绎等问题——听起来似乎是如何“抽象空洞”，但所有这些问题实际上都是现实的问题，因为它们使我们的干部善于正确地对待现实中的各种现象，因而也就能正确地进行自己的实际活动。
    在确定研究的主要问题的范围方面，以及在解决这些问题的态度方面，还存在着未被根除的教条主义，这是对辩证唯物主义问题进行大胆的科学研究的巨大障碍。对辩证方法和唯物主义理论的问题，还没有从其全部复杂性和多面性来研究，在一些论文和小册子中还相当普遍地存在着引证过多的风气。在解释辩证唯物主义对社会实践的巨大意义时，往往是狭隘的“实践主义”的说教，把理论归结为事例的总和。我们也很少进行有关辩证唯物主义的迫切问题的创造性的争论和讨论。还不敢就哲学问题交换意见和进行不同意见的争论。
    由此可见，辩证唯物主义方面的科学工作之所以落后，是因为哲学研究部门和各教研室对这种工作缺乏应有的重视，是因为教条主义的存在，以及不敢大胆地尖锐地提出新的问题。造成这种落后还有
  一个重要的原因，就是我们没有深刻地研究列宁的哲学遗产，没有好好地执行列宁的那些对于进一步发展辩证唯物主义具有头等重要意义的指示。我们的任务就是：坚决克服这种不可容忍的落后状况，并在最近期间力求使辩证唯物主义问题的科学研究工作得到提高。
                  ×××
    应该按什么方针进行工作呢？辩证唯物主义急待研究的重要问题是什么呢？
    这里的首要任务就是研究这样一个问题：在新的条件下，即在苏维埃社会主义社会的条件下以及人民民主国家的条件下，一般的辩证发展规律性具有哪些新的表现形式和发生作用的形式。研究这个问题，对于以顺利进行实践活动的途径的知识来武装共产主义建设的干部具有重大的意义。同时必须注意到列宁的指示：根据资本主义现代史和革命运动的经验来研究辩证法是很重要的。
    马克思列宁主义要求我们懂得：发展的一般规律在各种历史条件下不会有同样的表现，它们在不同条件下的表现和作用是不同的。一分钟也不能忘记恩格斯的这一著名指示：辩证唯物主义不是证明现成真理的方法，而是必须对具体历史情况进行具体分析的研究的方法。
    没有一个一般的辩证发展规律性，在社会主义条件下所发生的作用，会和它在对抗性的剥削社会形态的统治下所发生的作用一模一样。这一点也同样适用于这样一些规律，如通过对立斗争的发展，量变向质变的转化，以及其他等等。
    其次，马克思主义要求我们估计到：除了那些虽然具有不同的表现，但在各社会形态中都发生作用的一般规律之外，还存在着表明每一特殊社会形态的本质的特殊规律。因此，在专门的科学著作和论文中，研究关于马克思主义的规律观、规律的客观性质、一般规律和特殊规律、社会主义制度下的经济规律（与资本主义制度下的经济规律不同，它已消除了自发性）的作用的特殊性等问题，是很迫切需要的。同时要求共产主义建设的干部掌握客观规律，并在自己的实践活动中自觉地运用这些规律。
    必须特别注意研究与资产阶级社会中的矛盾不同的社会主义社会中的矛盾的性质，必须澄清在这个问题上还存在着的混乱现象。要在研究这一具有重大实践意义的重要哲学问题中获得成就，绝大部分要取决于科学研究同对现实生活过程的研究之间的密切联系的程度。当然，这一点也适用于对所有其他哲学问题的研究。
    苏联经济已进入高涨和全面发展的新阶段。苏共中央最近几次全会在决议中制定了重大措施来克服消费品生产部门和农业部门的落后状况，指出了进一步发展社会主义经济的途径。只有注意研究这些决议和实在的经济过程，才能做出有用的哲学概括。
    共产党非常重视批评和自我批评这种在苏维埃社会中新事物反对旧事物的斗争形式。批评和自我批评是揭露和克服发展中的矛盾的重要方法。尽管我们哲学家对于苏维埃社会中矛盾的这种斗争和克服的新形式谈得很多，但是，我们还没有写过一本科学的哲学著作来论述这个问题，这个问题对于理解一般的辩证规律性在社会主义条件下起作用的新形式有很大的意义。研究这个问题，对于共产主义教育，对于同人们意识中的资本主义残余作斗争，也是非常重要的。
    在宣传和研究辩证唯物主义科学问题的工作中，对于要唯物地分析我国社会发展的规律性这一点强调得不够。因此，在说明一系列的共产主义建设的现实问题时常常发生错误：如，不了解物质条件在解决社会发展的这些或那些问题上的决定作用，跳过还没有走过的发展阶段，脱离实际的空洞议论。正是由于这种方法论上的缺点，由于不太善于唯物地分析共产主义建设的迫切问题，所以一部分宣传员才把产品交换问题看成是今天的问题，过低估计了集体农庄所有制形式的巨大的、还没有挖掘出来的潜力。
    必须用马克思列宁主义经典著作家唯物地处理社会生活现象的优秀范例，用共产党决议的榜样，以善于冷静、实事求是地分析情况的精神来教育我们的干部。苏共中央九月全会，二—三月全会和六月全会的决议就是这种深刻的、冷静的和唯物的分析的光辉榜样。
    研究一般的辩证规律性在社会主义社会条件下发生作用和表现的特征问题，要同研究马克思列宁主义方法的理论问题、认识论问题密切地联系起来。对于辩证方法和认识论的许多方面研究得不够，正如我们以社会主义制度下的生产力和生产关系之间的矛盾问题为例所指出的，妨碍了对共产主义建设的迫切问题的分析。
    直到目前，哲学家把精力往往只放到研究辩证方法的四个特征或唯物主义理论的三个特征上，这个缺点也必须克服。应该估计到，斯大林的“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义”一书的任务在于，仅仅是通过易懂的形式来阐明唯物辩证法、解释世界的唯物主义理论以及认识论的基本特点。这本书中所指出的辩证法的四个特征，还没有包括马克思主义方法的全部财富和所有方面。
    列宁在“论战斗唯物主义的意义”一文中，要求我们研究辩证法的所有方面。在“哲学笔记”一书中草拟了辩证法的十六个因素。列宁列入这些因素的有许多唯物辩证法的范畴。列宁称范畴为认识的“中心的”支撑点。例如，辩证唯物主义的极为重要的范畴——内容和形式、原因和结果、偶然性和必然性、本质和现象、可能性和现实性等等就是这样的范畴。列宁和斯大林在其著作中对上述的许多范畴都做了深刻的研究。
    然而，最近几年来，几乎没有人研究辩证法的范畴。甚至在部分哲学家中间还流行一种荒谬的根本错误的看法：好像为了避免陷入“黑格尔主义”和烦琐哲学的危险，就不应该研究辩证逻辑的范畴和全部辩证逻辑。这种缺点在高等学校的哲学教学大纲中也表现出来了。把唯物辩证法弄得这样贫困的做法，是没有任何根据的。现在的任务就是要从辩证法的全部复杂性和多面性来研究辩证法。必须在最近期间写出一些有关辩证法范畴的专门性的著作和论文，阐明这些范畴对于认识和实践活动的全部意义。
    唯物辩证法是完整的、活生生的、创造性发展的科学。列宁正因为普列汉诺夫不了解这一点，所以才责备他，指出普列汉诺夫把辩证法归结为例证的堆积，而不注意把它当做一门哲学来研究。不应该把列宁对普列汉诺夫的责备了解为：在说明哲学问题时不需要例证。如果没有例证，任何一门科学都是站不住脚的。列宁责备的意思在于普列汉诺夫在引用许多例证时，只限于说明辩证法的个别原理，而不是把辩证法当做规律、范畴、概念（它们反映客观世界并给我们以认识和革命实践的强大工具）的科学体系来研究。
    列宁提出了研究唯物辩证法这门科学的结构的任务：把这门科学中的全部辩证法因素、规律和范畴当做统一的相互联系的整体来研究和发展。
    列宁也批评了普列汉诺夫不了解辩证法就是逻辑和认识论。然而，没有这一方面（列宁称之为事情的“实质”），就没有辩证法这门哲学。
    直到现在，还有人没有足够地估计到列宁关于辩证法、逻辑和认识论的统一这一指示的深刻意义，以及由这一指示而产生的研究辩证唯物主义问题的任务。列宁关于辩证法、逻辑和认识论的统一的原理表明：马克思主义克服了客观世界规律和认识规律之间、认识的内容和形式之间、实在世界和逻辑思维之间的脱离，而这种脱离正是唯心主义哲学的特色。辩证法一方面给我们提供了关于现实发展的最一般的客观规律的唯一正确的学说，同时它又是唯一科学的认识论和逻辑。既然如此（必然如此），那末我们的任务就不仅要完整地研究客观辩证法，同时要研究逻辑思维的辩证法，认识的辩证法。
    列宁的“哲学笔记”包含了关于这些问题的取之不尽的思想财富。列宁在其评语中草拟了研究马克思主义辩证逻辑的巨大纲领，制定了研究它的办法，指出了研究辩证唯物主义认识论所必须依据的那些知识部门。
    “哲学笔记”中所包含的下述指示对于进一步研究这些问题具有不可估价的指导意义：为了创立正确的辩证唯物主义的认识论，必须探溯各门科学的历史，研究小孩和动物的智力发展史以及语言等的发展史，研究认识的历史进程和思维规律之间的相互关系，研究概念、判断、推理等等的辩证性质。
    上述的列宁每一指示都是论述辩证唯物主义的哲学著作所要研究的对象。现在已经是着手解决这一艰巨而又非常重要的任务的时候了。还在哲学讨论会上就已指出，我们停留在普及工作上。无需证明，辩证唯物主义的普及工作今后还是需要的。并且要竭力加强这一工作，因为这一工作还不能满足渴望学习马克思列宁主义哲学的苏联人的巨大需要。
    同时，必须认真研究复杂的和有现实意义的辩证唯物主义的学术问题。在哲学中也像在任何一门科学中一样，不容许在重大而困难的问题面前表示畏惧和胆怯。在这条道路上困难一定会有，但我们在这些困难面前，应当是勇往直前，而不是退缩止步。不谈别的，就从这样一些争论中就可以看出这一工作的迫切性：这一或那一范畴应放到哪里，逻辑是怎样的，或者像恩格斯说的，各个范畴排列的从属、次序应该是怎样的。显然，只有研究马克思主义辩证逻辑的体系，才能回答这个问题以及类似的问题。
    我们几乎完全没有注意到这样一些重要的辩证逻辑和认识论的问题，如认识过程中的历史东西和逻辑东西、抽象东西和具体东西、本质和现象的相互关系。我们没有研究像分析和综合、归纳和演绎这样一些认识的方法。然而，所有这些对于了解认识的过程、途径和方法，以及对于进行顺利的实践活动，都有重要意义。研究逻辑和认识论的这些问题，可以用如何认识周围世界的知识来武装我们的青年学生和干部。这种研究对于自然科学家也有重大的意义。
    列宁曾提醒我们不要把客观现实在人头脑中的反映过程简单化，指出必须研究这种反映的全部复杂性和矛盾性。这也就是研究辩证法和认识逻辑的问题。我们必须用全部热情来进行这种研究。
    研究辩证唯物主义问题的哲学家面临着重大的任务，必须概括自然科学的新材料，估计科学的成就，以便进一步创造性地发展马克思主义哲学。在
  “唯物主义与经验批判主义”一书出版后的这一时期，自然科学发展的进程完全证实了列宁的下述预测：现代自然科学产生辩证唯物主义。这是一条非常复杂和痛苦的道路，特别是在资本主义国家，因为在那里资产阶级思想体系和无数改头换面的哲学唯心主义占着统治地位。
    但是，辩证唯物主义在自然科学中的产生过程，是一往直前和不可阻挡的，因为，正像恩格斯早已指出的，辩证法对于自然科学家是绝对必需的。像郎之万、约里奥·居里、贝尔纳等这些卓越学者的事例，就清楚地证明了这一点。郎之万承认，他在最近几十年来之所以能理解物理学的历史，只是由于依靠了辩证唯物主义。我们杂志第四期上刊载了著名法国物理学家路易·戴·勃罗依利的论文，他就反驳了物理学中非决定论的糊涂思想。
    苏联学者自觉地掌握着辩证唯物主义的世界观，在自己的工作中不断取得重大的成就。但是，不应忘记，就是在这里掌握马克思主义方法的过程也是复杂的，在苏联科学中还有唯心主义和形而上学观点的残余，苏联科学还不能保证不受那种我们必须竭力克服的唯心主义哲学的影响。
    因此，哲学家在这方面负有双重的任务。第一，必须一贯地和有系统地进行坚决的斗争，来反对唯心主义在自然科学中的散布，反对企图利用科学技术成就来保全和挽救唯心主义的资产阶级哲学。但是，必须善于进行这种斗争。不要忘记，许多外国的学者往往还唯心地来表述和说明这些或那些自然科学的成就。这是由于唯心主义哲学在资本主义国家中占统治地位的缘故。所以，借口同唯心主义作斗争而抛弃科学所获得的有价值的东西，是与马克思列宁主义的精神背道而驰的。这种趋向在我们杂志发表的讨论相对论问题的个别文章里也存在着。在这种情况下，必须遵循列宁的英明指示：在评价这些或那些自然科学的理论时，必须清除它的糟粕，保留它的精华，并用辩证唯物主义的观点来说明它。
    第二，哲学家必须大力帮助科学家阐明现代科学发展所提出的一系列的概念和理论。例如，物理学家就面临着一项困难的任务：从现代的观念来分析这样一些概念，如质量、能、核电荷、空间和时间、动力学的和统计的规律性、间断的东西和非间断的东西及其他许多概念。上面列举的这些概念表明，没有辩证唯物主义哲学的帮助，就不能解决这项任务。同时必须记住，这并不是说哲学家必须解决具体的物理学的任务或其他任务，必须代替科学家的工作。正如贝尔纳教授明确指出的，辩证法、辩证唯物主义只是完成战略任务，给科学家指出正确解决他们面临的问题的途径和方法，帮助他们从唯一科学的哲学观点来正确地思考自己的工作。
    同时，必须特别强调指出，苏联自然科学家——物理学家、生物学家、化学家、天文学家等本身能够而且必须更加大胆和坚决地把哲学同自然科学联系起来，给现代的科学发现做出哲学的概括。在苏维埃政权年代，我们的科学家在掌握唯一科学的世界观——辩证唯物主义方面经受了很大的锻炼。现在在科学工作方面很有成就的科学家，大部分都是从特别重视研究马克思列宁主义哲学的苏联高等学校毕业的。因此，我们的科学家要充分地把自己武装起来，以便能够练达地解决现代自然科学中的哲学问题。
    卓越的苏联科学家斯·瓦维洛夫一贯重视自然科学的哲学问题，在从哲学上分析新的科学材料方面做了许多工作，他公正地责备了我们的自然科学家在这方面缺乏应有的关心。他在谈到物理学方法论方面的巨大任务时指出，这件工作，“物理学家根本不能推托给哲学家，而应该自己来完成，最好是同哲学家密切合作来完成”。
    现代自然科学的成就要求哲学家在深入研究一系列的哲学概念、范畴、原理方面做更多的工作，以便进一步发展辩证唯物主义。例如，必须根据科学的成就，写出论述物质、物质的形态、物质和运动、物质运动的形式、空间和时间、物质和意识等方面的专门性著作。当然，这件工作要求哲学家认真地深入地研究自然科学。
    不能要求每个哲学家都知道所有复杂的和特别专门性的自然科学知识。但是，可以而且应该要求哲学家专长于科学的这些或那些方面。我们在从哲学上考察自然科学问题时还存在着轻率态度，这是不能容忍的。只要分析一下在各学术研究机关进行答辩的论题就可以看出，我们还很少指导我们研究哲学的青年去专攻自然科学的个别部门，我们这里研究物理学、生物学、宇宙演化学、数学等等的哲学家还为数很少。必须更积极更大胆地提拔毕业于自然科学学校的青年到哲学研究部门去。应该注意到，不消除我们工作中的这种缺点，我们就不能承担对自然科学最新材料进行哲学概括的艰巨任务。
    最后，还应当指出一项任务，就是研究与宣传马克思主义无神论、与反对宗教和迷信有关的一些问题。列宁在“论战斗唯物主义的任务”一文中把这一任务提到了首要的地位。我们哲学家对列宁的这一重要指示执行得很差。辩证唯物主义哲学给我们提供了反对宗教偏见和宗教欺骗的强有力的武器。这里的任务不仅在于通俗地解释这些问题，而且还要提出马克思列宁主义无神论中应该研究的问题。
    当然，上面谈到的，并没有包括进一步研究辩证唯物主义方面的全部任务。但是，这也就足以了解我们面临的任务的复杂、艰巨和责任的重大。党教导我们不要害怕复杂的和艰巨的理论任务，并且给我们树立了创造性地解决这些任务的榜样。在研究复杂的理论问题的过程中，是难免不犯这样或那样的错误的。但是，因此就不去提出和解决这些问题，那就是违背布尔什维主义的精神。错误是可以而且必须在开展创造性的卓有成效的讨论的基础上、通过同志般的交换意见而得到纠正的。
    总之，要认真地、勇敢地、创造性地研究辩证唯物主义的问题。
                                （王治平译）
