Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, February 20th: Preparations for the Asian-African Conference, scheduled to be held in April, are actively underway.

    The joint secretariat in Jakarta, responsible for the conference preparations, maintains close contact with the five sponsoring countries and all countries invited to the conference, and is working intensively on preparations. The joint secretariat holds weekly meetings to deal with various major issues in the preparation work. Currently, the joint secretariat is drafting a preliminary agenda for the conference, which will be provided to all participating countries for further consideration. The joint secretariat already published its first official communique on the 15th. The communique stated that all invited countries are likely to participate in the conference, as no notifications of refusal have been received to date.

    As the host and one of the sponsoring countries, the Indonesian government is actively preparing to receive the delegations, staff, and journalists from various countries, estimated to exceed one thousand people. Representatives from relevant government departments have formed a committee to unify the leadership of this work.

    In Bandung, the city selected as the conference venue, known for its beautiful scenery and cool climate, preparations are proceeding intensely. The "Gedung Merdeka" (Independence Building) has been selected as the venue for the plenary sessions of the conference. Its hall is 26 meters square and can accommodate more than 1,000 people. The dining room to the right of the hall is now being converted into rooms for use by subcommittees and lounges, which will be available for representatives of Asian and African countries to rest, chat, and informally exchange views.

    Currently, hundreds of workers are repairing this building. The building is being expanded and redecorated, and the parts of the building that were destroyed in World War II are being rebuilt.

    Carpenters are making new tables and chairs for the delegates. Electricians are installing lights and other equipment, including simultaneous interpretation equipment.

    The "Dana Pensiun" building, another large building not far from the "Gedung Merdeka," has been selected as the venue for the main subcommittees, such as the political, economic, and social subcommittees. Currently, workers are carrying out repairs to construct seven large conference rooms. These conference rooms will all be equipped with simultaneous interpretation equipment.

    【新华社雅加达二十日电】预定在四月间举行的亚非会议的筹备工作正在积极进行中。
    在雅加达的负责会议筹备工作的联合秘书处，同五个发起国家和所有被邀请参加会议的国家保持着密切的联系，并且紧张地进行着准备工作。联合秘书处每星期举行会议，处理筹备工作中的各种主要的问题。目前，联合秘书处正在为会议拟订初步议程，准备提供所有与会国家作进一步的考虑。联合秘书处已经在十五日发表了第一篇官方公报。公报说，所有被邀国家可能都将参加会议，因为迄今并没有收到过拒绝的通知。
    作为主人和发起国家之一，印度尼西亚政府正在积极进行接待估计超过一千人的各国代表团团员、工作人员和记者的准备工作。政府各个有关部门的代表已经组成了一个委员会，来统一领导这个工作的进行。
    在被选定为会议地点的景色美丽和气候凉爽的城市万隆，准备工作正在紧张进行中。“和平女神大厦”已经被选定为会议举行全体会议的场所。它的大厅有二十六公尺见方、能够容纳一千多人。大厅右侧的餐间现在改为供小组委员会使用的房间和休息室，这些休息室将供亚非国家代表休息、闲谈和非正式交换意见。
    目前，数以百计的工人正在修理这座大厦。大厦正在加以扩大，并且重新装饰起来，大厦的在第二次世界大战中被摧毁的部分正在重建起来。
    木工正在为代表们做新桌子和新椅子。电气工人正在安装电灯和其他设备，包括同时翻译设备在内。
    离开“和平女神大厦”不远的另一所巨大的建筑物“津贴基金大厦”，被选定为像政治、经济和社会小组委员会这样的主要小组委员会的会议场所。目前，工人们正在进行修理以修建起七间宽大的会议室。这些会议室都将设有同时翻译设备。
