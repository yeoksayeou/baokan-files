    [This newspaper dispatch] With the continuous improvement of people's lives in various cities and the increasing consolidation of the Renminbi's credit, the total amount of urban savings nationwide has continued to increase. By the end of 1954, the total urban savings nationwide had reached 12,778 billion yuan, an increase of nearly tenfold compared with the national savings at the end of 1950, and an increase of more than 2 trillion yuan compared with the national urban savings at the end of 1953. At the same time, the proportion of fixed deposits is increasing, and the deposit period is gradually lengthening. According to statistics at the end of September 1954, the proportion of fixed deposits in the total amount of urban savings had increased from 47.6 percent at the end of 1953 to 55.9 percent; the average deposit period for various savings has also been extended from 84 days at the end of 1953 to 112 days. The amount of savings in medium and small cities is also increasing rapidly. At the end of 1950, the amount of savings in the five major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou accounted for 58.8 percent of the national savings. At the end of 1953, the amount of savings in the above five major cities still accounted for 50.3 percent of the national urban savings; by the end of 1954, while the amount of savings in these five major cities continued to increase, the amount of savings in other cities had increased to account for 53.4 percent. The large and regular deposits of people in cities across the country have become a regular and reliable source of funds for accumulating industrialization.
    People's Banks in various places have actively strengthened urban savings business to meet the requirements of the broad masses of people. In 1954, People's Banks in various places added many small savings institutions and entrusted agencies, enterprises, etc. to establish many savings agency outlets.

The opening hours of grassroots savings institutions in various places have been reasonably arranged according to the working and resting hours of the masses. This year, People's Banks in various cities will implement a new accounting system to eliminate errors and better ensure the safety of depositors' funds; at the same time, they will continue to add small savings institutions, develop savings agency outlets, and improve business procedures to fully facilitate urban residents' deposits and withdrawals.

    【本报讯】随着各城市人民生活的不断改善和人民币信用的日益巩固，全国城市储蓄额不断增加。到一九五四年年底，全国城市储蓄总额达到十二万七千七百八十亿元，比一九五零年年底全国储蓄额增加近十倍，比一九五三年年底全国城市储蓄额增加二万多亿元。同时，定期储蓄的比重越来越大，存期也逐渐拉长。据一九五四年九月底统计，定期储蓄在城市各项储蓄总额中的比重，已经由一九五三年年底的百分之四十七点六增加到百分之五十五点九；各种储蓄的平均存期也由一九五三年年底的八十四天拉长到一百一十二天。中、小城市的储蓄额也在迅速增加。一九五零年年底，北京、天津、上海、武汉、广州五大城市的储蓄额占全国储蓄额的百分之五十八点八，一九五三年年底，上述五大城市的储蓄额还占全国城市储蓄额的百分之五十点三；到一九五四年年底，在这五大城市储蓄额继续增加的情况下，其他城市的储蓄额已经增加到占百分之五十三点四。全国各城市人民大量的经常的存款，已经成为一项经常可靠的积累工业化资金的来源。
    各地人民银行适应广大人民的要求，积极加强了城市储蓄业务。各地人民银行在一九五四年内增设了许多小型储蓄机构，委托机关、企业等建立了许多储蓄代办所。仅重庆、青岛、鞍山三市就增设了五十五个小型储蓄机构，上海、江苏、浙江、福建、河北五个省市就设立了一百六十四个储蓄代办所。各地基层储蓄机构的对外营业时间，都根据群众作息时间作了合理的安排。今年，各城市人民银行将实行新的会计核算制度，以便消除差错，更好地保证储户的资金安全；同时，还将继续增设小型储蓄机构，发展储蓄代办所，改进营业手续，充分便利城市人民存款和取款。
