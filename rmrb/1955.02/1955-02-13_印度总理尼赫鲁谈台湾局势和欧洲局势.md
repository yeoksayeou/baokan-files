Xinhua News Agency, London, February 11th: Indian Prime Minister Nehru held a press conference in London on February 9th, where he answered several questions regarding the recent Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference and Indian foreign policy.

    Speaking about the situation in the Taiwan area, Nehru said it was "not a satisfactory situation."

    Nehru said he had no doubt that the residents of China had very clearly decided to support the government of the People's Republic of China. He emphasized that the Indian government had recognized the government of the People's Republic of China from the beginning. Nehru said it was strange that the United Nations did not recognize a country like China. Discussing China's problems without Chinese representation was almost "absurd." "The obvious solution is to let China into the United Nations."

    In response to questions related to the German issue, Nehru said that he had met with West German Social Democratic leader Ollenhauer in London, during which they discussed the general international situation. Although India does not intend to interfere in European issues, the German issue is very important not only to Europe but to the whole world. "I don't think the German problem can be satisfactorily resolved without German reunification."

    These remarks help illustrate the attitudes of some participants at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference towards the German issue.

    The conference communiqué showed that the Prime Ministers did not reach a unanimous decision on this issue. The communiqué stated that the Prime Ministers were merely informed that the Commonwealth countries participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization believed that ratifying the Paris Accords was an important step towards the security and unity of Western Europe.

    Explaining India's attitude of not participating in the conference's discussions on regional military issues, Nehru said that in Asia, "if too much emphasis is placed on military issues," "then there is a risk of losing something more valuable—the support of the people."

    Nehru repeatedly stated his opposition to all military treaties, and when asked by a reporter whether this applied to the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, he replied: "Very much so."

    Nehru favored the prohibition of weapons of mass destruction.

    Speaking about the results of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, Nehru said that the Prime Ministers did not reach unanimous conclusions, but the frank exchange of views was "valuable."
    
    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, February 11th: Paris Radio reported that Indian Prime Minister Nehru met with German Social Democratic Party Chairman Ollenhauer, who had arrived there in London. The meeting discussed the German issue.

    Citing usually well-informed British sources, Paris Radio reported that Nehru said he believed that ratifying the Paris Accords could hinder German reunification, or greatly delay its realization.

    印度总理尼赫鲁谈台湾局势和欧洲局势
    【新华社讯】塔斯社伦敦十一日电：印度总理尼赫鲁二月九日在伦敦举行记者招待会，在会上他回答了有关最近的英联邦总理会议和印度外交政策的若干问题。
    在谈到台湾地区的局势时，尼赫鲁说，这“不是一个令人满意的局势”。
    尼赫鲁说，他毫不怀疑，中国的居民非常明确地决定拥护中华人民共和国政府。他强调，印度政府从一开始就承认了中华人民共和国政府。尼赫鲁说，联合国不承认像中国这样一个国家，这是奇怪的事。在没有中国代表参加的情况下讨论中国问题是近乎“荒谬的”。“明显的办法就是让中国到联合国中来。”
    在回答同德国问题有关的问题时，尼赫鲁说，他曾和西德社会民主党领袖奥伦豪尔在伦敦举行会谈，在会谈中他们讨论了一般国际局势。虽然印度并不打算干涉欧洲问题，但是德国问题不仅对欧洲，而且对全世界都是非常重要的。“我认为，德国不统一，德国问题就不能得到任何令人满意的解决。”
    这番话帮助说明了英联邦总理会议的某些参加者对德国问题的态度。
    会议公报显示，总理们并没有就这个问题作出一个一致同意的决定。公报说，总理们仅仅获悉，参加北大西洋集团的各联邦国家认为批准巴黎协定是走向西欧的安全与团结的重要步骤。
    尼赫鲁在解释印度不参加会议关于区域性军事问题的讨论的态度时说，如果在亚洲，“过多地重视军事问题，”“那么就有丧失更加有价值的东西——人民的支持——的危险。”
    尼赫鲁一再表示，他反对所有的军事条约，当记者问他这是否适用于东南亚条约组织时，他回答说：“非常是这样”。
    尼赫鲁赞成禁止大规模毁灭性武器。
    在谈到英联邦总理会议的结果时，尼赫鲁说，总理们得出的结论不是一致的，但是坦率地交换意见是“有价值的”。
    【新华社讯】塔斯社巴黎十一日电：巴黎电台报道，印度总理尼赫鲁在伦敦会见了已经到达那里的德国社会民主党主席奥伦豪尔。这次会谈谈的是德国问题。
    巴黎电台援引通常消息灵通的英国人士的话报道，尼赫鲁表示：他认为，批准巴黎协定可能阻挠德国的重新统一，或者是大大推迟它的实现。
