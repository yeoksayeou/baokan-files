Lu Fengshan Creates New Method for Water Construction

Lu Fengshan, a carpenter foreman of the Hanshui Highway Bridge Section, successfully created a method of overall installation of pre-assembled formwork.

In the past, bridge pier formwork was generally made in large pieces, and then transported to the pier by crane or manpower for assembly. Most of the operations during assembly were carried out outside the formwork, without scaffolding, and the work was mobile and inconvenient for attaching safety belts. The carpenters erecting the formwork could only stand on a horizontal strip one centimeter wide close to the formwork. This work was very unsafe. Especially for the piers in the center of the river, working at a height of more than 20 meters, with the river flowing under their feet, it was easy to become dizzy and lose their footing, causing accidents. After repeated research, Comrade Lu Fengshan proposed a method of overall installation, where the formwork is completely assembled in sections on the ground and then hoisted onto the pier by a crane. Based on his proposal, the second section of the No. 1 pier, which is 27 meters long, 2 meters wide, 4.5 meters high, and weighs about 18 tons, has been assembled on the ground and hoisted onto the pier, resulting in even better quality than assembling it on the pier in the past.

This installation method first improves the working conditions. All assembly work can be completed in advance on the ground, reducing the operations originally clinging to the outside of the formwork by 90%, ensuring the safety of workers' operations. Secondly, it increases labor productivity. According to test results, the average output per worker in pre-assembly and overall installation exceeds the quota by 26%. More importantly, it can be done in parallel with pouring concrete, which greatly shortens the construction period and is of great significance for underwater construction. This technological innovation is of the same significance not only for bridge engineering but also for other construction and installation projects.

This new construction method was once opposed by various conservative ideas. The party organization at the construction site resolutely supported the workers' bold experiments and mobilized engineers to provide technical research and assistance, and invited Soviet experts to review the proposal. Soviet expert Comrade Kalbinsky personally convened a meeting with Lu Fengshan and engineers to study the method and inspected the reinforcement of the pre-assembled formwork on-site. Engineer Su Yuanxian checked the condition of the formwork after pre-assembly and the stress during lifting and improved the lifting method. In this way, the overall installation method of pre-assembled formwork was successful. (Xin Yi)

    路凤山创造水上施工的新方法
    汉水公路桥工段木工领工员路凤山创造预拼模型板整体安装法成功。
    过去桥墩模型板一般是制成大块，然后利用吊车或人力运到桥墩上拼装。拼装时的大部分操作都在模型板外进行，无法搭脚手，工作又是游动的，而且不便系挂安全带。立模型板的木工工人便只能贴着模型板站在仅一公寸宽的横木带上工作。这样工作很不安全。特别是河心的桥墩，在二十多公尺高工作，脚下河水奔流，易于头晕失手，发生事故。路凤山同志经过反复研究后，提出了将模型板在地面分节全部拼好、用起重机吊到桥墩上的整体安装的方法。根据他的倡议，已把一号墩第二节长达二十七公尺、宽二公尺、高四点五公尺、重约十八吨的桥墩模型板在地面拼好后吊到桥墩上，比过去在桥墩上拼装的质量还好。
    这种安装法，首先是改善了劳动条件，所有拼装工作都可预先在地面上完成，把原来攀附在模型板外的操作减少了百分之九十，保证了工人操作的安全；其次是提高了劳动生产率，就试验结果来看，预拼整体安装中，平均每工超过定额百分之二十六。更重要的是可以和浇灌混凝土平行作业，这就大大缩短了施工期限，对水中施工有很大意义。这一技术革新，不仅对桥梁工程，而且对其他建筑安装工程也具有同样的意义。
    这一新的施工方法，曾经遭到各种保守思想的反对，工地党的组织一方面坚决支持工人大胆试验，另方面动员工程师在技术上给予研究帮助，并请苏联专家审查此项建议。苏联专家卡尔宾斯基同志亲自召集路凤山及工程师开会研究，并到现场检查了预拼好的模型板的加固情况。苏源仙工程师检算了模型板预拼后的情况和起吊时的应力，并改进了吊法。这样，预拼模型板整体安装法才获得成功。　（辛仪）
