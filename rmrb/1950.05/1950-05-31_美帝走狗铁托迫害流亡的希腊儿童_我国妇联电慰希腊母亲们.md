　　Tito, Lackey of American Imperialism, Persecutes Greek Children in Exile
    All-China Women's Federation Sends Telegram of Condolences to Greek Mothers
    [This Newspaper] On the eve of the "June 1st" International Children's Day, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation received a letter from Madame Gugurieva of the Secretariat of the Women's International Democratic Federation, enclosing a letter from the Greek Democratic Women's Federation and news about the tragic situation of Greek children and mothers. The letter said: "Nearly two thousand Greek children fled to Yugoslavia to escape American bombs and Royalist-fascist terror. The reactionary Tito government is preparing to hand these children over to the reactionary government in Athens, sending them to so-called 're-education camps,' which are in reality concentration camps where children are persecuted and starved." The Greek mothers issued a poignant appeal: pleading with the Greek Democratic Women's Federation to help them rescue their children from Tito's bloody clutches.
    Madame Gugurieva urged the All-China Democratic Women's Federation to support the appeals of Greek mothers and children.
    The All-China Democratic Women's Federation has replied to the Greek Democratic Women's Federation, expressing its anger and hatred at the shameful behavior of Tito, the lackey of American and British imperialism, in persecuting Greek children and mothers. It extended cordial and warm condolences to the persecuted Greek children and mothers. The reply stated: "Please convey our sincere enthusiasm to the persecuted Greek mothers and children. Please tell them that the sympathy and support of all peace-loving and democratic people around the world belong to them. The rampancy of the reactionaries is a death struggle; the suffering of the people is only the darkness before dawn. The victorious struggle of free Greece, the strikes in major Greek cities, and the anti-Tito movement of the Yugoslav people all illustrate this fact. Dear sisters, fight bravely, victory will surely be ours."

　　美帝走狗铁托迫害流亡的希腊儿童
    我国妇联电慰希腊母亲们
    【本报讯】在“六一”国际儿童节前夕，中华全国民主妇女联合会收到国际民主妇联书记处古久里夫人的来信，信中附寄了希腊民主妇女联合会的一封信和关于希腊儿童和母亲们的悲惨境遇的消息。信里面说：“有将近两千个希腊儿童，为了逃避美国炸弹和保皇法西斯的恐怖而到了南斯拉夫。反动的铁托政府正预备把这些儿童们交给雅典的反动政府，送到所谓‘再教育营’中去，但实际上它是使儿童受迫害和饥饿的集中营。”希腊的母亲们发出了沉痛的呼吁：恳请希腊民主妇联给她们帮助，从铁托的血腥魔掌中，拯救出她们的孩子们来。
    古久里夫人敦促中华全国民主妇女联合会，支持希腊母亲和儿童们的呼吁。
    中华全国民主妇女联合会已复信给希腊民主妇联，对于美英帝国主义走狗铁托迫害希腊儿童与母亲们的可耻行为表示愤怒与痛恨。对于受迫害的希腊儿童与母亲，致以亲切热诚的慰问。复信写道：“请把我们诚挚的热情转达给受迫害的希腊母亲和儿童们。请告诉他们，全世界爱好和平民主的人民之同情与支持是属于他们的。反动派的猖獗是垂死的挣扎；人民的苦难只是黎明前的黑暗。自由希腊的胜利斗争，希腊各大城市中的罢工，以及南斯拉夫人民的反铁托运动，都说明了这个事实。亲爱的姊妹们，勇敢地斗争下去，胜利一定是我们的。”
