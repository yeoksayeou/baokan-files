　　The People's Government Implements Work-for-Food Program
　　Dyke Repair and Water Management in Hubei, Henan, Hunan, and Jiangxi Nears Completion
　　[Wuhan News] According to the Changjiang Daily, the dyke repair and river management work in Hubei, Henan, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces is nearing completion. As of mid-April, the spring repair project of the Yangtze and Han Rivers in Hubei had completed 8 million cubic meters of earthwork out of a total of over 11 million cubic meters for the main dykes of the two rivers. As of the end of March, 79.2% of the dyke work along the Poyang Lake in Jiangxi had been completed. The dyke work along the Dongting Lake in Hunan is also nearing completion. The damming projects in various counties of the Yiyang Special District had been basically completed by early April, with reinforcement work lagging behind by one-third. According to the progress of the work, all projects can be basically completed by the end of April. River management work in Henan is progressing rapidly, with some parts already completed, and most parts are striving to be completed before the wheat harvest. The Yellow River spring maintenance project began in some areas in March.
　　Since last November, local people's governments have led the masses in carrying out dyke repair work in conjunction with production and disaster relief and various rural social reform movements. They have established water conservancy institutions, mobilized laborers to go to the dykes, and started construction. The government allocated large amounts of grain and funds for work-for-food programs to solve the livelihood difficulties of disaster victims. According to statistics from Hunan, Hubei, and Henan provinces, the grain allocated for work-for-food programs for dyke repair and river management reached over 150 million jin. In Hubei, disaster victims working on the dykes could receive an average of over four jin of wage grain per person per day, which solved the livelihood problems of a large number of disaster victims. Nearly 300,000 disaster victims in the Mianyang Special District of Hubei were rescued as a result. After receiving work grain, many disaster victims in some areas used the surplus work grain for production and organized fishing and transportation, which powerfully cooperated with the production and disaster relief work. In addition, in the course of dyke repair, propaganda and education were conducted among the masses, rent reduction and anti-local tyrant work were carried out, and the embankment grain embezzled by the pseudo-dyke workers in the past was liquidated, which greatly improved the enthusiasm of the laborers for dyke repair. Jingzhou and Mianyang Special Districts in Hubei Province used their rest time to hold small-scale peasant representative conferences to discuss rent reduction and anti-local tyrant work, and carried out anti-local tyrant and rent reduction work as soon as they returned home at night.
　　After the spring plowing work began, many areas effectively combined dyke repair with spring plowing. Farmers in Anxiang and Anhua polders in Hunan organized dyke work teams to repair dykes in rotation and engage in production in rotation. In Xihua County, Henan Province, men and women had specific divisions of labor, with men going to the river to repair dykes and women organizing at home to weed wheat and sow seeds, so that spring plowing production was not affected.

　　人民政府实行以工代赈
    鄂豫湘赣修堤治水接近完成
    【武汉讯】据长江日报消息：鄂、豫、湘、赣四省修堤治河工作，接近完成阶段。湖北长江汉水春修工程，至四月中旬止，两水干堤一千一百余万公方土工程已完成八百万公方，江西鄱阳湖滨堤工至三月底止已完成百分之七十九点二，湖南洞庭湖滨堤工亦接近完成，益阳专区各县堵口工程四月初已基本完成，培修工作尚差三分之一，按工作进展情况，四月底全部工程可基本完成。河南治河工作正迅速进展，现一部已经完成，大部争取在收麦前完工。黄河春厢工程，部分地区已在三月间开始。
    自去年十一月起，各地人民政府领导群众结合生产救灾及农村各种社会改革运动，相继开展修堤工作，成立了水利机构，动员民工上堤，开工兴修，政府拨大批粮款以工代赈，解决灾民的生活困难，湘、鄂、豫三省统计，修堤治河以工代赈粮达一亿五千余万斤。湖北上堤灾民每人每日平均能得工资粮四斤以上，由此使一大部分灾民生活获得解决。湖北沔阳专区即有近三十万灾民因此获救。不少地区灾民在获得工粮后，又以多余的工粮用于生产，组织打鱼运输，有力的配合了生产救灾工作。另外在修堤中，结合对群众进行宣传教育，开展减租反恶霸工作，清算伪堤工人员过去贪污的堤工粮，大大提高了民工的修堤情绪。湖北荆州、沔阳专区，利用在休息时间开小型农代会，讨论减租反恶霸，晚上回家即进行反恶霸减租工作。
    在春耕工作开始以后，不少地区又将修堤与春耕有力的结合起来进行，湖南安乡安化垸农民，组织堤工队，轮流修堤，轮流生产。河南西华县男女具体分工，男的上河修堤，女的在家组织起来锄麦播种，使春耕生产没有受到影响。
