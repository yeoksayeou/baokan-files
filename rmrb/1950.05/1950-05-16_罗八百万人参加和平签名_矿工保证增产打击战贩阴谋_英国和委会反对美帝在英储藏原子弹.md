　　Xinhua News Agency, 15th: Consolidated TASS reports: The Romanian people continue to promote the peace signature campaign with great enthusiasm. As of the 14th, out of Romania's total population of 16.4 million, 7,930,200 people, nearly half of the country's population, have signed the appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. In Bucharest, the capital of Romania, more than 637,000 people have participated in the signature campaign. The number of rural residents participating in the signature campaign reached 5.6 million.
　　When the Romanian working people signed the appeal, they pledged to contribute to the foundation of lasting peace with their work achievements. A miner named Filaru in the Doj region said, "Producing 10 million tons of coal and steel more than planned will be our answer to the conspiracy of the warmongers." The farmers in Senasesti Township said when they signed that striving for a bumper harvest is an effective contribution to the cause of peace.
　　Xinhua News Agency, London, 15th: TASS, London, 13th: After Reuters published the United States' proposal to store atomic bombs in Britain and North Africa, the British Peace Committee issued a statement saying: This proposal should be a shock to those who have not seriously paid attention to the warnings of the Peace Committee. This report once again points out that Britain's independence is currently being rapidly and further lost. The statement called on all those who cherish peace and British independence to resist this plan to turn Britain into an atomic bomb base and demanded the withdrawal of American soldiers and bombers.

    英国和委会反对美帝在英储藏原子弹
    【新华社十五日讯】综合塔斯社消息：罗马尼亚人民继续以极大热情推进和平签名运动。到十四日为止，在罗马尼亚全国一千六百四十万人口中，已有七百九十三万零二百人，即接近全国人口的半数，在世界拥护和平大会常委会呼吁书上签了名，在罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特，已有六十三万七千余人参加签名。乡村居民参加签名者达五百六十万人。
    罗马尼亚劳动人民在呼吁书上签名的时候，保证要用他们的工作成就，来为永久和平的奠定，贡献力量。多吉地区的一位矿工费拉鲁说：“超过计划增产千万吨的煤和钢，将成为我们对战争贩子的阴谋的一个回答。”塞那塞斯提乡的农民们在签名的时候说：他们争取丰收乃是对和平事业的有效贡献。
    【新华社十五日讯】塔斯社伦敦十三日讯：在路透社发表美国建议在英国与北非洲储藏原子弹以后，英国和平委员会即发表声明称：这个建议，对于那些没有郑重注意和平委员会警告的人，当是一个震惊。这个报道又一次指明英国的独立，目前正迅速和进一步的丧失。声明号召一切珍视和平和英国独立的人们，抗拒这个使英国成为原子弹基地的计划，并要求撤回美国士兵和轰炸机。
