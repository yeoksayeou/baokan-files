Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 26th: After the conclusion of the Third Shanghai People's Representative Conference, the participating representatives returned and widely and deeply conveyed the resolutions and spirit of the meeting. This played a significant role in strengthening the connection between the government and the people and mobilizing people from all walks of life to jointly overcome the current temporary difficulties.

The conveyance work was very extensive. In addition to holding meetings to make reports, representatives from all sectors also used various mass commemorative activities during Red May, as well as forums, night schools, political classes in schools, student representative meetings, and women's representative meetings, to conduct widespread conveyance. Worker representatives conveyed the information to workers through trade unions and directly in factories. According to preliminary statistics, more than 142,000 workers have heard the reports. Representatives from the business and industrial sectors also conducted widespread conveyance in various industries.

Most representatives, during the conveyance, also explained practical methods for overcoming difficulties. For example, worker representatives emphasized that in private enterprises, labor must proactively unite with capital, establish labor-capital consultation meetings, and jointly overcome difficulties. In public enterprises, workers assist in implementing democratic management and actively participate in factory management committees. Representatives from the business and industrial sectors focused on conveying the principle of labor-capital consultation to maintain production and the spirit of criticism and self-criticism from the meeting, and emphasized that recognizing the situation and transforming themselves are important links for the business and industrial sectors to overcome current difficulties. Before and after the conveyance, the cotton textile industry, with the representatives as the core, held four consecutive meetings and formulated specific plans for break-even production and internal reform, including operational standards for the industry (including setting quantity, quality, materials, and staffing).

Due to the widespread and in-depth conveyance, people from all sectors have a clearer understanding of the nature of the current difficulties, thereby increasing their confidence in jointly overcoming them. People in the business and industrial sectors generally reflected that before the Third People's Representative Conference, the business and industrial sectors were hesitant and apprehensive. After the discussion and analysis at this meeting, everyone recognized that the current difficulties are temporary and saw a bright future.

The various facts that have already begun to appear prove that this meeting indeed pointed out the path for the people of Shanghai to overcome the current difficulties.

The number of labor-capital consultation meetings in private enterprises has increased from 16 before the conference to 75 in the past month. Xin Yu Yarn Factory, Merlin Food Company, and others have gradually achieved break-even self-sufficiency due to the establishment of labor-capital consultation meetings and the improvement of management policies. Some private enterprises have also begun to transform themselves. For example, the private Shenxin Textile Factories have established a Shenxin General Management Office to unify the leadership of the production of the six factories and have begun to carry out work such as setting positions, staffing, and quotas.

The relationship between public and private sectors has also improved. Public enterprises have been helping private enterprises to produce in a planned way through methods such as ordering and processing. For example, in April, the East China Daily Necessities Company invested 88.1 billion yuan in private enterprises through acquisitions or entrusted processing and transferred all the yarn and cloth worth 21 billion yuan to various places to regulate the market.

The resolution to relieve unemployed workers has won the support of employed workers throughout the city and the enthusiastic support of workers from all over the country. As of the 20th of this month, the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions Unemployed Workers Fund Management Committee had received more than 7.141 billion yuan in donations.

　　上海各界代表传达代表会议决议
    各界克服困难信心增强
    【新华社上海二十六日电】上海市第三次各界人民代表会议闭幕后，与会代表回去都广泛地、深入地传达了会议的决议和精神，对密切政府与人民的联系、动员各阶层群众共同克服当前的暂时困难，起了很大作用。
    这次传达工作的进行是非常广泛的，各界代表除召开会议作传达报告外，并通过红五月的各种群众性的纪念活动及座谈会、夜校、学校的政治课、学生代表会和妇女代表会等，进行广泛的传达。工人代表则通过工会和直接下厂向工人传达，据初步统计，已有十四万二千余工人听到了传达报告。工商界代表也在各行业中普遍进行了传达。
    大多数代表在传达中配合说明有关本身克服困难的实际办法。如工人代表着重说明：在私营企业中，劳方必须主动团结资方，建立劳资协商会议，共同克服困难；在公营企业中，工人协助实行民主管理，积极参加工厂管理委员会。工商界代表着重传达了劳资协商维持生产的原则及会议的批评和自我批评精神，并强调指出：工商界认清时局、改造自己，是克服目前困难的重要环节。棉纺业在传达前后，以代表为核心，连续召开了四次会议，拟订了该业的经营标准（包括定量、定质、定料、定员）等保本生产、内部改革的具体方案。
    由于传达的广泛深入，各界人民更加清楚地认识了目前困难的性质，因而增加了共同克服困难的信心。工商界人士普遍反映说：在第三次各界人民代表会议未开前，工商界是彷徨和疑惧的。经过这次会议的讨论分析，大家认清了目前的困难是暂时的，看到了光明的前途。
    目前业已开始出现的种种事实，证明这次会议确实指出了上海人民克服当前困难的道路。
    私营企业的劳资协商会议，一个月来已由大会前的十六个，增加至七十五个。新裕纱厂、梅林食品公司等，由于成立劳资协商会议，改善了经营方针，已逐步做到保本自给。某些私营企业也开始着手改造，如私营申新纺织各厂已成立申新总管理处，统一领导六个厂的生产，并着手进行定职、定员、定额等工作。
    公私关系也有了改进。公营企业已通过定货、加工等办法，有计划地帮助私营企业进行生产。如华东日用品公司，四月份通过收购或委托加工等方式，对私营企业投放的款项达八百八十一亿元，并将价值二百一十亿元的纱布全部调运至各地，以调剂市场。
    救济失业工人的决议，获得了全市在业职工的支持及全国各地工人的热情支援，至本月二十日止，上海总工会失业工人基金保管委员会收到的捐款已有七十一亿四千一百多万元。
