　　Yin Bingyan's Company Branch Work in Production
　　Zhang Huchen
    Editor's Note: Comrade Yin Bingyan is the political instructor and concurrently the Party branch secretary of the Eighth Company of a certain regiment of a certain division directly under the North China Military Region. Due to his active work and correct leadership methods, the situation of the previously relatively backward Eighth Company has changed. The division party committee of the division called on the entire division to launch a campaign to learn from Yin Bingyan (published in this column on March 7). This time, in the embankment construction work, Comrade Yin Bingyan adopted the working method of the mass line, gave play to the core leadership role of the branch, and achieved good results again. Now, his working methods are introduced below as a reference for Party organizations in the army to lead labor production.
            Concentrate the Wisdom of the Masses to Solve Problems in a Timely Manner
    Embankment construction by the troops is a new problem, and everyone has very little experience. It happened that the other three cadres of the Eighth Company went for training, leaving only Comrade Yin Bingyan. He was busy on and off the embankment all day long, going to the work sections, and back home, making inspections at any time, and correcting deviations in a timely manner. He arranged and cared for military, political, hygiene, and food work at all times. The soldiers' reflection was: The instructor thought of everything for us and worried even more than we did. He knew very well that one hand cannot cover the sky, and he should always look to the masses. The method is: frequently discuss things with everyone, firmly grasp the organization and system, and use the guidance group (composed of branch committee members as the core) to meet once a day at noon in the work section, focusing on studying the improvement of construction technology. Meet again before the roll call in the evening (at this time, the quartermaster is included), focusing on reporting the ideological situation of the day, solving major problems, and then dividing the remaining tasks into categories, assigning the strong to the strong and the weak to the weak to solve them. By doing this, it saves time, has a focus, he is neither subjective nor dancing alone, and the cadres also understand the overall situation and the intentions of the leadership, and they have a clear direction and motivation in their work. Since then, platoon leaders have proposed "don't wait for the company if there is something," squad leaders have proposed "don't wait for the platoon if there is something," and groups have proposed "don't wait for the branch if there is something." Everyone consciously and actively thinks of the whole company (These slogans: It is good to give play to the cadres' initiative to solve problems and be responsible at each level, but the wording is not comprehensive, because some problems must be reported to the higher level before they can be handled – Editor of the North China People's Liberation Army Daily). When the three platoon leaders got together to study their work, they said: "Our company only has the instructor himself, and the three of us should contact each other more to prevent loopholes in the work." Platoon Leader Tian Laoduo (branch committee member) saw that the whole company was slow to assemble and had poor military discipline, so he took the initiative to convene a discussion among the squad leaders in his platoon to correct this, and then contributed the methods discussed to the company for research and promotion. Squad Leader Zhang Hongbai of the ninth squad and Squad Leader Wang Wenli of the tenth squad, seeing that their platoon leader was on duty, also took the initiative to study how to unite the third platoon well and prevent problems; they reported to the platoon leader and proposed: "Please help the company and other squads more, and we will help you." If there is a problem in the squad, the group will quickly guarantee a solution. In this way, few problems occur in the Eighth Company, and when problems do occur, they can be solved in a timely manner, the troops are consolidated, and morale is high.
            Pay Attention to Improving Technology and Caring for Soldiers' Lives
    In the first two weeks, because the troops lacked labor training and had no labor experience, the ideological guiding principle proposed by the regimental committee was "steady and sure." Some companies only pursued earthwork achievements, and even formed competition rushes, resulting in damaged tools and sick soldiers. Comrade Yin Bingyan was good at understanding the intentions of the superiors and proposed that the main task in the first two weeks was not to pursue the amount of earthwork, but to practice the basics and find experience, and whoever had a good method should quickly propose to turn it into the whole company's method. At the same time, it was pointed out that the method of soil removal and ramming is not fixed, but is constantly improved and enriched in exploration. Because he grasped the spirit of the superiors and made specific ideological mobilization, in the result of the tour and commentary of all the regimental cadres in the first week, the Eighth Company's soil removal and dumping methods were consistent, the organization was the most orderly, the walking was straight and flat, and the construction was meticulous and stable, becoming the first in the whole regiment. The constant change of technical methods often caused complaints in general companies, obstructing the rapid implementation of orders. But the Eighth Company changed quickly and happily, because he had given everyone ideological education in advance that working methods are constantly enriched and improved. For example, after the regiment organized a work section visit, proving that unified technical action is an effective method for implementing engineering guidance, the Eighth Company quickly organized a visit and inspection with one person from each squad, so that the method could be quickly unified. Other companies did not pay attention to doing this, so the technical improvement was slower than the Eighth Company.
    In the second week of embankment construction, soldiers were found to have dysentery and eye diseases due to barefootedness after the rain. The branch then specifically discussed how to take care of and provide intensive treatment, and decided that in addition to carrying out education to call for protecting the body and strengthening hygiene work, each patient would be given an extra half a pound of white flour and two eggs a day for soup. It was decided that the seven patients with eye diseases would not be allowed to participate in evening roll call and would not stand guard at night, so as to find more time to rest. As a result, three of the eye patients recovered after six days, and the other four also improved, and the five dysentery patients were also close to recovery. These comrades not only went to the embankment every day to persist in most of the labor, but also felt the warmth of the Party. Li Wanquan said while eating the patient's meal: "It's not about how much there is, it proves that the higher-ups care about us." This played a great role in uniting the whole company.
            Strengthen the Overall Concept and Actively Unite Friendly Forces
    At the beginning of the embankment construction, the superiors strictly required to achieve "reality, flatness, and smoothness," and paid special attention to the joints. It happened that the west side of the Eighth Company was a certain regiment of anti-aircraft artillery. Comrade Yin Bingyan emphasized in the mobilization construction that it is necessary to strengthen the overall concept and pay special attention to uniting friendly forces. In this company, the squads and platoons are not allowed to have large or small ditches when dumping soil, and more soil must be dumped towards the joint with the friendly forces. And he pointed out: Whether this work is done well is not a problem for our company, but a problem for our division and the artillery unit. Our company's good unity with them represents the entire division, and the soldiers very much supported this proposition. In the execution, not only did this squad scramble to dump soil to avoid gaps, but they also helped each other. When the twelfth squad fell behind, the ninth squad leader automatically called on each member of his squad to carry ten more loads of soil to help make up for it. When dumping soil towards the joint with the friendly forces, they always dumped three meters farther, which made the regiment have a very good impression of the Eighth Company. After seeing this, one of their battalion commanders immediately mobilized the battalion to learn from the Eighth Company and also dumped more soil for the Eighth Company. In this way, they competed to dump more, and both sides were very satisfied, and it was simply impossible to tell where the joint was. One day it rained, and the regiment asked the Eighth Company to go to their American tents to take shelter from the rain, and let the Eighth Company rest on the side that did not leak. The Eighth Company asked to switch with them, but they firmly refused. The soldiers of the Eighth Company were even more moved. Since then, a close connection has been established with the friendly forces, and they often visit each other and exchange experiences. To this day, they still dump more soil for each other. The Eighth Company's high degree of overall concept and class-loving spirit has won the praise of the Water Conservancy Bureau and has been praised by the division party committee.
    The main shortcomings currently existing in the Eighth Branch are: sometimes it is too lenient towards the soldiers, which makes the management and education work in production not tight enough. After the division party committee announced that it would no longer launch a flag-grabbing campaign, some comrades developed a sense of relaxation, and they are trying to improve.

### 在生产中的阴炳彦的连队支部工作

　　在生产中的阴炳彦的连队支部工作
　　张虎忱
    编者按：阴炳彦同志是华北军区直属某师某团八连的政治指导员，并兼党的支部书记。由于他工作积极，领导方法正确，使原来比较落后的八连情况为之改变。该师师党委为此号召全师开展学习阴炳彦运动（刊三月七日本栏）。这次在筑堤工作中，阴炳彦同志采取了群众路线的工作方法，发挥了支部的核心领导作用，又获得了很好的成绩。现将其工作方法介绍于后，作为部队中党组织领导劳动生产的参考。
            集中群众智慧及时解决问题
    部队筑堤是个新问题，大家经验全不多。赶上八连其他三个干部都去受训了，只留了阴炳彦同志一个人。他整天地堤上堤下地忙着，上工段，回到家，随时作检查，发现偏差及时纠正。军事、政治、卫生、伙食工作时时在布置和关心。战士们的反映是：指导员什么都给咱想到了，操心比咱还要累。他深知一人手大遮不了天，什么时候都要找群众。办法是：有事勤和大家商量，抓紧组织和制度，利用指导组（支委为核心组成）每日中午在工段上碰头一次，重点是研究施工技术改进问题。晚上点名前再碰头一次（此时吸收司务长参加），重点是汇报一天思想情况，解决主要问题，未了分门别类地强对强弱对弱的分工去解决。这样作：省时间，有中心，自己既不主观，又不孤身跳舞，干部们也了解全面情况和领导意图，干工作有准头也上劲。自此排长们提出“有事不等连”，班长们提出“有事不等排”，小组提出“有事不等支部”，大家都自觉地主动地一切为全连着想（这些口号：在发挥干部主动解决问题逐级负责是好的，但提法不全面，因为有些问题必须请示上级后才能去办——华北解放军报编者）。三个排长凑在一起研究工作时说：“咱连就指导员自己，咱们三人可得多联系，别叫工作出了漏洞。”田老多排长（支委）见到全连集合动作慢，军风纪不好，主动召集本排班长讨论纠正，而后把讨论出来的办法贡献给连里研究推广。九班长张洪柏、十班长王文礼、见到他们排长值星，也主动研究怎样使三排团结好，不出问题；向排长汇报时提出：“请你多帮助连里和别班，我们帮助你。”班里有个问题，小组很快就保证解决了，这样，八连发生问题很少，有了问题也能及时解决，部队巩固，情绪饱满。
            注意改进技术关心战士生活
    开始两周中，因为部队缺乏劳动锻炼，更无劳作经验，因之团委提出的思想指导方针是“稳扎稳打”。有些连队只去追求土工成绩，甚至形成竞赛突击，致损坏工具，累病了战士。阴炳彦同志善于领会上级意图，提出头两周主要的不是追求出土量多大，而是磨练打底，找经验，谁的办法好就很快提出把它变成全连的。同时指出除土打夯方法不是固定的，它是在不断摸索中改进丰富的。因为他掌握了上级精神，具体的作了思想动员，在第一周的全团干部工段大参观评论结果，八连除土倒土方法一致，组织统一最有秩序，走道又直又平，施工细致又稳，成为全团第一。技术方法的不断改变，一般连队常有怨言，障碍号令迅速推行。而八连则说改就改，迅速愉快，这是因为他事先给大家进行了工作方法是不断丰富改进的思想教育。再如团里组织一次工段参观，证明统一技术动作是实施工程指导有效方法后，八连回去也就迅速组织了各班一人参加的参观检查，使方法能很快统一。别连不注意这样作，技术改进就比八连慢。
    筑堤第二周，战士因雨后赤脚等缘故发现痢疾和眼疾。支部便专门讨论如何照顾与突击治疗，决定除进行教育号召爱护身体，加强卫生工作外，并给病号每人每日增半斤白面，和二个鸡蛋作汤。对七名患眼疾的病员决定不让他们参加晚点名、夜间不站岗，找出更多时间来休息。于是六天后眼病好了三名，其余四名也轻了，五名痢疾病员也近痊愈。这些同志，不但每日都上堤照常坚持大部劳作，同时很感党的温暖。李万全吃着病号饭说：“不在东西多少，证明上级关心我们。”这对团结全连起了很大作用。
            加强整体观念主动团结友军
    筑堤开始上级就严格要求作到“实、平光”，特别注意结合部分。恰巧八连的西边就是高射炮某团。阴炳彦同志在动员施工时便强调提出了一定要加强整体观念，特别要注意团结友军。在本连班排倒土不许有大小鸿沟，向友军结合部那边一定多倒土。并提出：这个工作作的好不好，不是咱们一个连的问题，是本师与炮兵部队的问题。我们一个连和他们搞好团结，是代表全师的，战士们很拥护这个主张。在执行中。不但这班向那班抢着倒土不留空隙，并且互相帮助。十二班落了后，九班长便自动号召本班每人多担十担土赶快帮助补齐了。在向友军结合部倒土时一直多倒出三米远，使该团对八连印象很好。他们一位营长见后立即动员该营向八连学习，也给八连多倒。这样互相抢着多倒，双方都很满意，简直分不出那是结合部。一天下雨，该团就叫八连都到他们的美式帐篷去避雨，并把不漏的一边让八连休息。八连要求和他们换一下，他们坚决不肯。八连战士更受感动。自此和友军建立了亲密的联系，经常互相参观交谈经验。至今仍是互相多倒土。八连这种高度整体观念阶级友爱精神，博得了水利局的好评，受到师党委的表扬。
    八支部目前存在的主要缺点是：有时对战士还有过于姑息的地方，致使生产中的管理和教育工作抓不紧。在师党委宣布不再发动夺旗后，个别同志产生松气现象，他们正在设法改进中。
