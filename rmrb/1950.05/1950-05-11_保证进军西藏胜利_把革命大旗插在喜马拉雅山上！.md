Guarantee Victory in the Advance into Tibet
　　Plant the Revolutionary Banner on the Himalayas!
　　Some units, during their commendation conferences, and in conjunction with the specific circumstances of their units, seriously criticized the erroneous thoughts of some individuals in the face of victory, such as pursuing enjoyment, clamoring for position, engaging in corruption and degeneration, and becoming lax and numb. At the Hero and Model Conference held by the Logistics Department, the heads of the department called on everyone to take on the task of building the Southwest, which had already begun in 1950, to ensure that the entire army was clothed and fed, to guarantee support for the advance into Tibet, to ensure unified finance and economics, and to overcome difficulties. At the commendation conference held in Guanghan, a certain unit that had now entered Xikang, the hero representative Du Cunfu, excitedly stated at the conference: "The remaining enemies have not been completely eliminated, and the working people have not been completely liberated; we must continue to advance, consolidate our victory, and go wherever there are enemies to fight! We will go wherever there are people who have not been liberated, and always be a good soldier of Chairman Mao!" The commendation conference greatly enhanced the class consciousness of the heroes, models, and all commanders and fighters. Lv Wenhua, a second-class meritorious individual from the First Transportation Regiment, said: "The old society ruined me to the point of being useless, the new society saved me, and I was even recognized as a meritorious individual, which shows that the People's Liberation Army will never bury talent. I am determined to respond to the call of the leaders to complete the glorious task assigned to me by the higher authorities in 1950." A certain unit preparing to continue its advance to liberate Tibet, after holding a celebration conference, everyone resolutely expressed their determination to advance into Tibet and plant the revolutionary banner on the Himalayas!

    有些单位在贺功会上，并结合了本单位的具体情况，严肃地批判了某些人在胜利形势中所发生的闹享受、闹地位、贪污腐化、松懈麻痹等错误思想，提出了一九五零年的工作方向和战斗任务。后勤部召开的英雄模范大会上，该部首长号召大家要把已经开始了的一九五零年的建设西南的任务承当起来，保证全军穿衣吃饭，保证支援进军西藏，保证财经统一，战胜困难。在广汉召开贺功大会现在已进入西康的某部，功臣代表杜存福曾兴奋地在大会上表示：“残余敌人还没有彻底消灭，劳动人民还没有彻底翻身；我们要继续前进，巩固胜利，那里有敌人打到那里去！那里有未翻身的人民就到那里去，永远当一个毛主席的好战士！”贺功会后大大提高了英雄模范和全体指战员们的阶级觉悟。一辎团二等功臣吕文华说：“旧社会害得我堕落得不成样子，新社会救了我，我还被评为功臣，这说明解放军决不会埋没人材。我决心响应首长号召完成一九五零年上级给我的光荣任务。”准备继续进军解放西藏的某部在召开庆功大会后，人人坚决表示要挺进西藏，把革命大旗插在喜马拉雅山上！
