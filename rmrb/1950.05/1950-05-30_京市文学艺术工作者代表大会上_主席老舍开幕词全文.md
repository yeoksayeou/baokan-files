Opening Address by Chairman Lao She at the Beijing Municipal Congress of Literary and Art Workers

The Beijing Municipal Congress of Literary and Art Workers Presidium Chairman, Lao She, delivered the opening address, the full text of which is as follows:

　　On behalf of the presidium, I would first like to welcome all the delegates and guests, and thank the leaders for attending and giving guidance. Secondly, I ask you to forgive the preparatory committee for any inadequacies in its preparations. The preparatory committee, from its inception to today, has only had two weeks; the short time makes it inevitable that the work is somewhat negligent due to the pressure. In terms of spending money, the preparatory committee has strived for economy; therefore, the hospitality and arrangements are inevitably simple. However, I believe that you will understand and forgive us.

　　The establishment of the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles (文联), from all perspectives, is necessary. From the perspective of the Beijing Municipal People's Government, because the government is of the people, it should have a mass organization of literary and art workers to help the government and the Party serve the people in literature and art. From the perspective of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the national federation cannot easily promote its work without local federations as a foundation. From the perspective of Beijing's special circumstances, the establishment of the federation also has its urgent needs:

　　(1) Beijing has two million people. This is a considerable number. Compared with some small countries in Europe, this city, in terms of population, is larger than one or two countries. Judging solely from the population figures, we know that unless all the literary and art workers in Beijing are mobilized, it will be impossible to supply such a large number of people with a substantial amount of spiritual food.

　　These two million people have only recently been liberated. However, we have already seen the good results achieved by the new masters of the country, the worker comrades, in various productions, and we have also seen the literary and artistic works they have produced in their spare time. This is truly exciting and makes us feel that a new era has indeed arrived in this ancient capital. On the other hand, although Beijing is a large city, it is not far from the countryside and fields. We not only see the emancipation of farmers in the suburbs, but also see many professors, students, and intellectuals participating in land reform, writing down their feelings and the knowledge and wisdom they have gained from the farmers. This is also unprecedented. However, precisely because we have a new understanding of the working class and peasantry, we should sincerely unite, work together to depict their noble qualities, encourage them to move forward, and help them learn culturally.

　　At the same time, among these two million people, there are also many who have lived under the feet of the emperor for a long time, so they need some laxatives to cleanse the accumulated feudal toxins in their stomachs. At the same time, they also need some tonics to strengthen their hearts and brains so that they can become healthy citizens of the People's Government. This kind of elixir can only be concocted by literary and art workers, concocted in a way that is neither too drastic in purging nor haphazard in tonifying, and using entertainment, persuasion, emotion, and beauty as medicinal guides.

　　(2) Beijing is the capital of the new China, and many of the capital's facilities naturally play a leading role for the whole country. Taking literature and art as an example, even if the works are created based on local scenery, as long as they are well done, they will fly away without wings, flying faster and farther than anything else. Therefore, the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles not only takes care of the two million brothers and sisters in Beijing, but it will also indirectly have a good influence on the whole country. Moreover, we do have the conditions to play this leading role, look:

　　(3) Beijing opera, over the past hundred years, has become its own school, welcomed everywhere. The famous artists in Beijing's opera circles are also national, and even international, stars. Today, a movement to improve opera is unfolding across the country; then, based on Beijing's past contributions and achievements in this area, plus the existing talent and their efforts, I am confident that Beijing's achievements in opera improvement will be more outstanding than elsewhere, thus playing a leading role. Furthermore:

　　(4) Not only is opera like this, but all departments of new literature and new art are also like this, because Beijing is a place where talents gather. Moreover, these talents largely retain the tradition of the May Fourth Movement and possess the revolutionary spirit of anti-imperialism and anti-feudalism. Although this tradition has been violently destroyed by the Japanese invaders and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, violence has not completely subdued the writers and artists. Today, we have a new government and wise leaders, and the spirit of the May Fourth Movement has been revived, and coupled with newer revolutionary theories and the encouragement of the people, Beijing, which was once compared to Rome in the Renaissance era, is now going to become China's Moscow. This hope has probably been thought of in the hearts of every literary and art worker in Beijing. Then, let us unite, work together to realize this ideal, and emulate the writers and artists of Moscow.

　　However: There is still a very important question here. That is, how to combine new literature and art with folk literature and art? How to infuse new blood into old forms? How to adopt the essence of the folk literary and artistic heritage to make the new literature and art a solid, native-grown thing, no longer like before, "dog growing horns, pretending to be a sheep (foreign)!" This is an extremely difficult problem to solve, and it requires new and old talents to unite in one place, constantly exchange opinions and cooperate, so that we can be fair and impartial, and jointly find the path to creating national literature and art.

　　(5) We also do not lack young cadres. Beijing is a city of schools. The activities of the federation will surely establish close contact with literary and art professors and teachers; this contact will surely strengthen students' understanding and participation in social literary and artistic activities. This will soon train a strong and elite contingent of literary and artistic personnel, and then disperse them to various provinces and regions, raising the banner of literary and artistic work high. For this point alone, the Beijing Federation of Literary and Art Circles is necessary.

　　I think what I said above is not an exaggeration. Sitting in front of me are the celebrities of the Beijing opera and literary circles I mentioned, and the representatives of workers and students. They will prove that I have not exaggerated, because they are all willing to organize the Beijing Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles in accordance with today's needs; otherwise, they would not be here at all.

　　However, it is easy to say, but difficult to do. This depends on whether we can truly unite well and do our work well. It also depends on whether we can humbly learn from others to make up for our shortcomings; and sincerely offer what we are good at to teach others; so that we can achieve a unity like "fighting tigers requires brothers, and fighting battles requires fathers and sons." There are difficulties, but unity will overcome them.

　　Finally, we thank the person in charge of the Labor People's Cultural Palace for lending us the venue and providing us with all the conveniences. The Beijing Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles can hold its founding meeting in the Labor People's Cultural Palace, which is truly "a happy start." Didn't Chairman Mao's instructions on the direction of literary and artistic work say that literature and art must serve the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers? (Attached picture)

### 京市文学艺术工作者代表大会上  主席老舍开幕词全文

　　京市文学艺术工作者代表大会上
    主席老舍开幕词全文
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市文学艺术工作者代表大会主席团主席老舍致开幕词，全文如下：
    我代表主席团，首先来欢迎诸位代表，诸位来宾，并感谢首长们到会指导。其次，我请诸位原谅筹备委员会一切筹备得不周到的地方。筹备委员会由产生到今天，才一共不过有两个星期；时间短促，工作就难免因紧张而有所疏忽。在用钱上，筹备委员会是力求节约的；那么，在招待与布置上就难免简陋。不过，我相信，诸位先生一定会由体谅而原谅的。
    北京文联的成立，由各方面看，都是必要的。从北京市人民政府看，因为政府是人民的，就理当有个群众性的文学艺术工作者的团体，好帮助政府与党，在文艺上为人民服务。从全国文联来看，全国文联若没有各地的文联作基础，便不易推动工作。从北京的特殊情形来看，文联的成立也有它迫切的需要：
    （一）北京有二百万人民。这是个相当大的数目字。比起欧洲那几个小国来，这个城，在人口上，比一两个国还大。专从人口数字上看，我们就知道；除非把北京所有的文艺工作者总动员起来，是无法把大量的精神食粮供献给这么多的人民的。
    这二百万人民都被解放不久。可是，我们已经看见了国家的新主人翁，工人同志们，在各种生产上所表现的良好成绩，而且也看见了他们在业余所产生的文艺作品。这真使我们兴奋，并感觉到一个新时代的确已来到这古老的都城了。在另一方面，北京虽是个大都市，可是离城不远，便有农村与田地。我们不单看见郊区农民的翻身，并且看见不少教授学生和知识分子去参加土地改革，写出来他们的感想与由农民间得来的知识与智慧。这又是史无前例的事。可是，正因为我们对工农大众有了新的认识，我们才应当热诚的团结起来，共同努力，去描画他们的高尚品质，鼓励他们前进，并在文化上帮助他们学习。
    同时，这二百万人民之中，可也有不少是久住在皇帝脚底下的，所以他们需要一些泻药，去洗刷干净肠胃中的封建的余毒积滞。同时，他们也需要一点补药，去补心健脑，使他们壮实起来，好作人民政府的健全公民。这种灵药，只有文学艺术工作者会炮治，炮治得既不猛泻，也不乱补，而且是以娱乐、说服、感动、美丽，作药引子的。
    （二）北京是新中国的首都，首都的许多设施是自然而然的对全国有带头作用的。专拿文学与艺术来说，作品即使是就本地风光而创作出的，只要作得好，他们便会不翼而飞，比什么东西都飞得更快更远。因此，北京文联不仅是照顾着北京的二百万兄弟姐妹，它也必能间接的给全国以好的影响。而且，我们的确有发生这带头作用的条件，看吧：
    （三）北京的戏曲在百年来，便已自成一派，受到各处的欢迎。北京戏曲界的名家，也是全国的，甚至是国际的，名角儿。今天，全国各地普遍的展开戏曲改进运动；那么，以北京过去的在这一方面的供献与成就，再加上现有的人才与他们的努力，我确信北京的戏曲改进的成绩要比别处作得更出色，因而发生带头作用。还有：
    （四）不单戏曲如是，在新文学与新艺术的各部门也都如是，因为北京是人才荟萃的地方。这些人才，而且，是多少保有五四运动的传统的，是具有反帝反封建的革命精神的。这传统，虽然遭受了日本侵略者蒋匪帮的暴力破坏，可是暴力并没有使文学家们，艺术家们，完全屈服。今天，我们有了新的政府，与贤明的领袖，五四运动的精神得以复活，而且加上了更新的革命理论与人民的鼓励，于是当年曾被比作文艺复兴时代的罗马的北京，今天要成为中国的莫斯科了。这一希冀，大概是在每一个在北京的文艺工作者的心中都想起过的。那么，就教咱们团结起来，齐心努力的实现这理想，与莫斯科的文学家艺术家们看齐吧。
    不过：这里还有个很重大的问题。那就是新文艺怎样与民间文艺相结合？如何把新血液灌输到旧形式里去？如何采取民间文艺遗产的精华，去使新文艺成为结实的土生土长的东西，不再像先前那样“狗长?角，充羊（洋）！”这是个极难解决的问题，正需要新旧的人才团结到一处，经常的交换意见与合作，才会不偏不倚，共同找出创作民族文艺的道路来。
    （五）我们也不缺乏年青的干部，北京是一座学校之城啊。文联的活动，必能与文艺教授教员们取得密切的联系；这一联系就也必加强学生们对社会上文艺活动的了解与参加。这，不久就会练出一枝精强的文艺人马，而后分散在各省各地，高悬起文艺工作的旗帜。就专凭这一点，北京文联也有成立的必要。
    我想，我在上面所说的，并没有什么夸大的地方。我面前坐着的，正是我所提到的北京戏曲界，文艺界的名人，和工人与学生们的代表。他们会证实我没有夸大，因为他们都愿意顺应着今日需要，组织起北京市文联；否则他们就根本不会到这里来。
    不过，说着容易，作起来难。这就看我们能不能真正好好的团结，努力搞好我们的工作了。更要看我们是否能虚心的向别人学习，以补自己之所短；热诚的拿出自己所擅长的，教给别人；好作到“打虎亲兄弟，上阵父子兵”似的团结。困难是有的，但团结必会克服困难。
    最后，我们感谢劳动人民文化宫的主持人，借给我们会场，并给我们一切便利。北京市文联能在劳动人民文化宫开成立大会，真是“出门见喜”。毛主席对文艺工作方向的指示，不是说文艺须给工农兵大众服务么。（附图片）
