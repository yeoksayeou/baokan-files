　　New Atmosphere of the People's Railway

　　The "Oil Bag" of Zhengzhou Transformed
　　The locomotives of the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot had a nickname: "Oil Bag." This was because the locomotives were covered in oil inside and out. When this nickname reached the ears of the train crews, they were very unwilling to hear it. But no one wanted to wipe it off, because they thought that was the job of the car cleaner. In the past, train crews followed the motto "Locomotive to the factory, people to home," and didn't care about the locomotives they drove. The train crews' clothes were especially clean, while the locomotives were especially dirty. What was most painful was that oil leaked from all the oil holes, and accidents such as locomotive pins wearing out today or axle burnouts tomorrow could be heard everywhere.
　　Since the "Mao Zedong" locomotive arrived in Zhengzhou, the "Oil Bag" has changed. On the morning of November 4th last year, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive entered the depot. The train crews of the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot were all surprised, "What did they use to clean this locomotive so brightly?" At this time, Min Zhenguo, the driver of locomotive No. 770, ran to the front of the car and touched the dazzlingly bright rocker and connecting rod, and he exclaimed excitedly: "Fellows! I didn't get any oil on my hands." But at that time, everyone mistakenly thought that the depot gave the "Mao Zedong" locomotive more materials, so it could be wiped so brightly, and it didn't attract much attention.
　　A month later, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive was even brighter than when it arrived. However, the cleaning materials used were less than those used for other locomotives. The "Mao Zedong" locomotive crews wiped the car every day, and the cotton waste had been used more than a dozen times, but they were still reluctant to throw it away. They not only cleaned their own car, but also helped clean locomotive No. 1554. Then, locomotive groups 258, 777, and 770 also began to work hard to brighten their locomotives. The atmosphere of cleaning cars became more and more intense every day. Each locomotive seemed to have good news in general, wiped so brightly that the iron sheets that had not seen the light of day for many years, saw the light of day today. After the car arrived at the factory, the train crews inspected, repaired, and wiped the car before handing over, fundamentally changing the bad habit of "car to the factory, people to home." As a result, accidents such as axle burnouts and wear have also gradually decreased.
　　Thanks to the leadership and help of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive, no one calls the locomotives of the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot "Oil Bag" cars anymore. Many people asked strangely: "Where did the Zhengzhou Locomotive Depot get so many new locomotives?" The train crews smiled with joy. The dirtiest locomotive No. 2204 in the past has now become the best typical locomotive in the shunting group, clean and accident-free. (Meng Zhaoren, Zheng Yiming, Li Baowen)

　　Beijing Station Takes on a New Look
　　Before liberation, the public's comment on Beijing Station was "paying money to suffer," waiting in line early to not buy a ticket, having to spend more money to buy black market tickets; being extorted by bag carriers and some porters, embezzlement and theft were open secrets. After liberation, after a year of study, the class consciousness of the workers has been greatly improved, and they have begun to establish the concept of serving passengers. Nearly 20,000 passengers come and go from Beijing Station every day, and everyone feels that Beijing Station has a new atmosphere.
　　In order to eliminate black market tickets, the ticket office has implemented a long-term opening of windows and pre-selling tickets for the next day, so passengers can buy tickets at any time. The staff consciously launched a struggle against corruption and drove away the bag carriers. Porters charge according to regulations, not only do not extort, but also do not want extra money given by passengers. They also actively take care of passengers. The cleaning department sweeps the inside and outside of the station clean. The station platform garden is decorated with flowers, grass, and fountains. Newspapers and magazines are sold on behalf of others in the waiting room. There is also an "unmanned bookstore" on the platform, where passengers can pay according to the price and take newspapers and magazines for reading during the journey, which is a symbol of China's new morality. There are also mailboxes with stamped envelopes and paper and pens for passengers to send letters and make phone calls on behalf of them. Guides patiently explain the regulations to passengers, and when injured, elderly, or weak passengers get on and off the train, the guides help them hire cars, find hotels, and send them to the hospital. The care for passengers is truly meticulous. Since 1950, all trains have departed on time 100%. All of these have completely changed the face of Beijing Station, facilitated passengers, and received verbal praise and letters of commendation from passengers.
　　However, all the staff of Beijing Station are not satisfied with this achievement, and are now carrying out a production competition in May, June, and July, striving to improve their work to a higher level. (Collective creation of the Beijing Station Trade Union Communications Group)

　　人民铁道的新气象
    郑州“油包”转变了
    郑州机务段的机车有个外号，叫“油包”。原因是机车里外到处都是油。这个外号传到乘务员的耳朵里，他们很不愿听。但是谁也不愿动手擦一擦，因为他们认为那是擦车夫的事。从前乘务员是“机车到厂，人到家”，对自己驾驶的机车，毫不关心。乘务员衣服特别干净，而机车特别脏。尤其使人最痛心的就是：各油眼的油里外流，今天机车销子磨耗了，明天机车烧轴了等事故到处可以听到。
    自从毛泽东号机车到郑州后，“油包”变了样。去年十一月四日的早晨，毛泽东号机车进库了。郑州机务段的乘务员们都感到奇怪，“这个机车是用什么擦的这么亮？”这时，七七○号司机闵振国跑到车前摸了摸照眼光亮的摇杆、连杆，他兴奋地嚷了起来：“伙计们！一点油都没有沾到我的手上。”但当时大家都误认为段上给毛泽东号的材料多，才能擦这么亮，并没引起重视。
    过了一个月，毛泽东号机车比来的时候更亮了。擦车材料却比别的机车用的还少。毛泽东号乘务员们天天在擦车，棉丝已经用了十几次，还舍不得扔。他们不但擦自己的车，并且帮助一五五四号机车擦车。接着二五八，七七七，七七○机车组也开始下苦工擦亮了自己的机车。擦车的空气一天天地浓厚起来。每台机车都好似有了喜事一般，擦的照眼明光，使多年不见天日的铁皮，今天也见了天日。车到厂后，乘务员们都是以检点，整修，擦车，然后才交班，根本改变了“车到厂、人到家”的坏作风。因此，烧轴、磨耗等事故也日渐减少。
    由于毛泽东号的带头和帮助，郑州机务段的机车，再没有人叫“油包”车了。很多人奇怪的问：“郑州机务段又打那来这么多的新火车头呢？”乘务员们叫后满脸笑容。过去最脏的二二○四号机车，现在已经变成调车组内最好的典型机车了，又干净，又没事故。          （孟照仁、郑义明、李保文）
    北京站焕然一新
    解放前旅客对北京站的评论是“花钱受气”，早早排队买不到票，得多花钱买黑票；受搂包和部分搬运工人的勒索，贪污盗窃是公开的秘密。解放后，职工经过一年的学习，阶级觉悟大大提高，开始树立了为旅客服务的观点。北京站每天有将近两万旅客来往，人人感觉北京站有了新气象。
    客票房为了消灭黑票，实行常期开放窗口，预售次日客票，旅客可以随时买到车票。职工自觉地展开了反贪污斗争，驱逐了搂包。搬运工人都按规定收费，不但不勒索，而且旅客多给都不要。他们还主动加以照顾。清扫部门把车站内外扫得干干净净。站台花园布置得有花、有草、有喷水池。候车室内代售书报。站台上并设有“无人售书处”，旅客可以按照定价付款，自取书报，以供旅途中阅读，这是中国新道德的象征。另设有备有贴好邮票的信封信纸及代旅客发信和代打电话的信箱。向导员耐心向旅客宣传解释规章，遇有伤员和老弱病号旅客上下车时向导员并帮他雇车、找旅馆、送医院。对旅客的照顾真是无微不至。一九五○年以来，各次列车都百分之百正点开出。所有这些使北京站整个改变了面貌，便利了旅客，得到旅客口头称赞和来信表扬。
    但是北京站全体职工并不满足这点成绩，现正开展五、六、七月生产竞赛，努力把工作再提高一步。
