    Multiple Accidents Due to Not Relying on Workers

    [Zhangjiakou Dispatch] The responsible persons of the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway Zhangjiakou Railway Factory lack the idea of relying on the worker masses, and do not go deep into the worksite to understand and guide the work, resulting in multiple accidents and causing losses to national property. In July last year, the welders in the riveting group suggested setting up an insulated room to prevent the wheel rims from shrinking rapidly when exposed to cold after electric welding in the severe winter, which would cause cracking. Although the factory director approved the implementation of this suggestion, the workshop was too busy with other matters and it was never established. As a result, five wheel rim cracking accidents occurred in succession in December last year. When the first wheel rim cracked, the locomotive department did not make a formal report, the workshop did not check the cause in time, and the management committee did not supervise the investigation. It was not until five consecutive cracking accidents occurred that the leading cadres began to pay attention. The foundry group also failed to boldly rely on the workers to improve work methods, resulting in sand holes in three cylinders in a row, delaying the departure of locomotive No. 1551 from the factory. The responsible persons of the factory do not pay attention to the health of the workers and regard overtime as a good way to increase production. When workers request overtime, they blindly approve it. This has led to the idea of earning more overtime pay among some workers, who often deliberately extend the working hours in order to get overtime. Working overtime at night and then working again in the morning with insufficient energy is also one of the causes of accidents.

    不依靠工人多次出事故
    【本报张垣讯】京绥路张家口铁路工厂负责人，缺乏依靠工人群众的思想，又不深入现场了解与指导工作，致发生多次事故，给国家财富造成损失。去年七月，该厂铆工组工友曾提出设立保温室的建议，以防止冬季气候严寒时，轮圈经电焊遇冷骤缩，而发生崩裂现象。该项建议虽经厂长批准施行，但工作室因忙于事务，始终未办。去年十二月，曾因此连续发生五次崩裂轮圈事故。第一次轮圈崩裂时，机车所未做正式报告，工作室亦未及时检查原因，管委会更未督促调查。直至连续发生五次崩裂事故后，领导干部才开始注意。翻砂组也由于不敢放手依靠工人，改善工作方法，连制三个汽缸，都有砂眼，延误了一五五一号机车出厂。该厂负责人不注意工人健康，把加班作为增加生产的好方法。工友请求加班，即盲目批准。在部分工友中也就产生了多挣加班费的思想，往往故意将工作延长时间，以便加班。晚上加了班，早晨又工作，精神不足，这也是发生事故的原因之一。
