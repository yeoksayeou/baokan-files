　　Composition of the Labor-Management Consultation Meeting of Xinhua Rubber Industry Company
    [Our Newspaper] The Labor-Management Consultation Meeting of the privately-owned Xinhua Rubber Industry Company was established on May 13th. Both parties have determined that improving production will be the focus of future consultations. It is stipulated that meetings will be held once every half-month, and if necessary, either party can propose and convene a meeting at any time with the consent of the other party. The principle is that meetings should not take up production time. The issues to be discussed at each meeting shall be notified to the other party by the representatives of both parties three days before the meeting, so that the representatives of both parties can study in advance and solicit opinions from relevant parties and employees; if necessary, the chairman may notify the proposer or relevant responsible person to attend and participate. The scope of consultation includes not only specific issues such as increasing output, saving materials, and related wages, benefits, rewards, and punishments, but also stipulating consultation on issues related to labor-management mutual assistance, joint maintenance of production, and overcoming difficulties.

　　新华橡胶工业公司劳资协商会议组成
    【本报讯】私营新华橡胶工业公司劳资协商会议已于五月十三日成立。双方确定以改进生产为今后协商的中心。规定每半月召开会议一次，必要时有一方提议经对方同意即可随时召开。开会以不占用生产时间为原则。每次准备协商的问题由双方代表于开会前三日通知对方，以便双方代表能事先研究，征求有关方面和职工的意见；如有必要时可由主席通知提案人或有关负责人出席参加。协商范围除提高产量节约材料与有关工资福利奖惩等具体问题外，并规定协商有关劳资互助共同维持生产克服困难的问题。
