　　The Great Significance of Commemorating "May 12th"
　　Kang Xin
　　On the eve of the nation's efforts to prepare for the cross-sea campaign to eliminate the remaining Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan; on the days when the national working people are actively engaged in production and construction, celebrating the first Red May since the founding of the Central People's Government; our national health and medical workers are joyfully celebrating the annual "May 12th" Nurses' Day to review our work achievements and strength, and to criticize shortcomings in our work to transform ourselves and improve our work, which is of great significance.
　　First of all, it should be recognized that our medical workers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in the past People's Liberation War, with unparalleled courage and enthusiasm, accompanied the People's Liberation Army under the leadership of our great Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, went through countless arduous wars, defeated the powerful enemy, regardless of the peacetime training and marching health care work; wartime battlefield rescue, hidden medical assistance behind enemy lines to wounded guerrillas; assaults on fortified positions, large-scale battles - such as Huaihai, Liaoxi - in the rescue and transfer of hundreds of thousands of wounded commanders and fighters comrades; crossing the river, crossing the sea, assaults in the remote deserts, marches in the harsh border areas, design for cold and heat protection and the struggle against nature; as well as in the Northeast, Chahar-Mongolia area to prevent and control the plague epidemic, the Xiangjiang River basin to resist the invasion of malaria, the Yangtze River Delta area to resist and prevent Japanese schistosomiasis and other work, have demonstrated the great strength of our entire medical staff, we have overcome difficulties, we have relied on the masses to show incredible skills, in dangerous and urgent environments, we have demonstrated courage and wisdom, created countless meritorious, heroes, models, won brilliant achievements, praised by the Party, the people and the commanders and fighters, and tens of thousands of medical staff, in order to complete the tasks given to him by the Party and the people, and sacrificed blood, wounded, and even contributed his life.
　　We not only serve the comrades in the army, to ensure the health of the troops, so that commanders and fighters determined to fight, we with the same spirit of friendship, in accordance with the instructions of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the traditional style of the Red Army and the Eighth Route Army, to the people, workers, peasants and laborers to carry out health propaganda and free medical care, become one of the important weapons of the army to unite the masses, showing great persuasive power and the atmosphere of "the army and the people are one family", moved the masses and defeated the enemy.
　　Secondly, with the victory of the People's Liberation War, the vast majority of our medical staff have entered the cities from the countryside. According to the provisions of our country's health work policy and the Common Program, we have gained some preliminary experience in managing urban health work, in uniting and transforming the old health personnel after liberation, and in learning from advanced technical personnel, especially in the health construction of people's cities - for example, in the urban areas of Lushun-Dalian, Shenyang, Harbin, Beijing, and Shanghai, we have obtained the guidance and assistance of Soviet health experts, overturned the dilapidated and unreasonable urban health work methods, and started a new type of health construction work serving the working people. Therefore, it also enlightened us on the new direction of our future work.
　　When we commemorate "May 12th" this year, we can review our past and see our creations and achievements to encourage our confidence in future work. At the same time, we also have many, even serious, shortcomings in our work, which should be reviewed and overcome with the spirit of "self-criticism". For example, we have been in a war environment blocked and divided by the enemy for a long time, and we know very little about new scientific knowledge of health medicine and nursing; we only have preliminary experience in the rescue and medical treatment of large-scale modern warfare, and we cannot and will not thoroughly grasp the work of peacetime urban health management, prevention and health care. We have some achievements and understanding of medical work, but preventive work (including epidemic prevention and health care) is still in the initial stage. We are still facing the difficulties of famine, hunger, epidemic diseases, and the contradictory situation of extreme lack of manpower, material resources, and medicine; we are not good at cooperating with the old technical personnel and better uniting the progressive medical personnel; we are still relatively unfamiliar with the regular hospital management, so that medical errors continue to occur; and we do not have enough power to transform on a large scale some backward medical ideas and selfish health work styles (although we are advancing locally) to achieve the national health medical staff unity and cooperation to work together.
　　Because of the existence of these actual situations, the government and the people require us to work hard on:
　　1. According to the principle of "prevention first, medical treatment as auxiliary" of the health work policy of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government, our medical staff should first realize that we cannot only be satisfied with the past medical requirements of "healing the wounded, rescuing the dying, and treating diseases", which is still the most important work in the attack on Taiwan and Kinmen to wipe out the remaining enemy, but in the whole country - we must shift to the principle of "prevention first" in health work to prevent and control diseases and epidemics, ensure the people's health, and get through our thinking, and oppose the simple medical technology point of view.
　　2. To unite the national medical staff (including traditional Chinese medicine) to solve the needs of the people, study urban health management, industrial and mining women and children's health operations to serve the people; to rely on and organize the vast working masses and women to participate in the health movement to ensure production and national defense construction.
　　3. To learn from the progressive health medical workers, critically accept its scientific and technological part, arm ourselves, to improve the level of health science, especially it is important to learn from Soviet health experts comrades, learn from the Soviet Union's health construction experience after the victory of the revolution, to transform our work.
　　4. The national medical personnel, to transform themselves with the spirit of "serving the people" and the standard of "everything for the wounded and sick", and to improve their sense of responsibility and sympathy for the wounded and sick.
　　At this first "May 12th" festival after the founding of the Central People's Government, our national medical personnel celebrate our past achievements to welcome the coming of the complete victory of our national revolution; reviewing and improving our work to take on the task of health construction in the new China is the best way to commemorate "May 12th".
　　Our health medical pioneers who sacrificed their lives in the People's Liberation War are immortal.

　　纪念“五一二”的伟大意义
　　康心
    在全国人民奋力准备渡海作战，消灭残余的台湾蒋党匪帮的前夕；全国劳动人民积极生产建设，庆祝中央人民政府成立后第一个红五月的日子里；我们全国卫生医护工作者欢欣鼓舞的来庆祝一年一度的“五一二”护士节，来检查我们的工作成就和力量，批判工作中缺点以改造自己改进工作，是有重大意义的。
    首先应当认识到我们中国人民解放军的医护工作者，在过去的人民解放战争中，曾以无比的英勇与热情，伴随着我们伟大的毛主席朱总司令领导之下的人民解放军，经过无数次艰苦战争，战胜了强大的敌人，不论在平时整训行军的卫生保健工作；在战时战场救护，敌后隐蔽医疗护助负伤的游击队员；攻坚战的随部队进攻，大规模会战——如淮海，辽西——中的成十万负伤指战员同志的抢救后送医疗组织工作；渡江，渡海，穷荒沙漠中的进击，边疆艰苦地区的进军，防寒防暑的设计和自然斗争；以及在东北、察蒙地区的防治鼠疫流行，湘江流域中抵抗疟病的侵袭，京沪杭三角地带的抵抗与防治日本住血吸虫病等等工作，都显示了我们全体医护人员伟大力量，我们在克服困难中，我们依靠群众表现了不可思议的技巧，在危险急迫的环境中，发挥了勇敢与智慧，创造了无数的功臣、英雄、模范，获得了辉煌的成绩，为党为人民为指战员所赞扬，同时成万的医护人员，为了完成党与人民给他的任务，而牺牲流血，伤残，以至贡献了他的生命。
    我们不仅为部队同志服务，保证了部队的健康，使指战员决心奋战，我们以同样的友爱精神，按照毛主席朱总司令的指示，红军八路军的传统作风，向老百姓工农劳苦群众进行卫生宣传与免费医疗，成为部队团结群众的重要武器之一，表现了很大的说服力量与“军民一家”的气象，感动了群众与战胜了敌人。
    其次随着人民解放战争的胜利，我们医护工作者绝大多数由乡村而进入了城市，根据我们国家的卫生工作政策与共同纲领的规定，在管理城市卫生工作上，在团结改造解放后旧有的卫生人员上，在向进步的技术人员学习上，都获得了一些初步的经验，特别在人民城市的卫生建设上，——例如旅大、沈、哈、京、沪市区我们获得了友邦苏联卫生专家的指导协助，推翻了残旧的不合理的城市卫生工作方式，开始了新型的，为劳动人民服务的卫生建设工作。因此也启示了我们今后工作的新方向。
    在今年纪念“五一二”的时候，我们检讨过去，可以看到我们这些创造与成就，以鼓舞今后的工作信心。同时我们也存在很多的以至严重的工作中的缺点，应当以“自我批评”的精神，来检讨与克服，例如我们长期的处在被敌人封锁分割的战争环境里，对新的卫生医药护理科学知识知道的很少；我们还只对于大规模的现代战争的救护医疗有了初步经验，而对于平时的大城市的卫生管理预防保健的工作，还不能也不会彻底掌握。对于医疗工作有些成就与认识，对预防工作（包括防疫保健）还处在草创的过程。我们还面临着灾荒饥饿疫病流行的困难，而又存在着人力物力医药十分缺乏的矛盾现况；我们还不善于和旧有的技术人员合作与更好的团结进步医务人员；我们对正规的医院管理还比较生疏，以至医疗过失不断发生；更没有足够的力量大规模的改造某些落后的医学思想，与自私自利的卫生工作作风（虽然我们正在局部的前进着）而达到全国的卫生医护人员团结合作，来共同努力。
    正因为这些实际情况的存在，政府与人民要求我们努力的是：
    一、根据中央人民政府卫生部的卫生工作方针“以预防为主医疗为辅”的原则，我们医护人员首先应该认识到：不能只满足于过去“救死扶伤，治病救人”的医疗要求，——这在渡海作战，歼灭台湾、金门残敌的进攻上，还是最重要的工作，但在全国范围内——我们要转移到“预防为主”的卫生工作原则来防治病疫，保证人民健康，要搞通思想，反对单纯的医疗技术观点。
    二、要团结全国医护人员（包括中医）在一起解决人民的需要，研究城市卫生管理，工矿妇幼卫生作业为人民服务；要依靠与组织广大的劳动群众联合妇女群众，参加到卫生运动中去，以保证生产与国防建设。
    三、向进步的卫生医护工作者学习，批判的接受其科学技术部分，武装自己，以提高卫生科学水准，特别重要的是向苏联卫生专家同志学习，学习苏联革命胜利后卫生建设经验，来改造我们的工作。
    四、全国的医务人员，要以“为人民服务”的精神与“一切为着伤病员”的尺度，来改造自己，与提高自己的工作责任心与对伤病员的同情心。
    当此中央人民政府成立后，第一个“五一二”的节日，我们全国医护人员庆祝我们过去的成就，来迎接我们全国革命彻底胜利的到来；检讨与改进工作，来担负起新中国卫生建设的任务，才是纪念“五一二”的最好纪念方法。
    我们的在人民解放战争中牺牲了生命的卫生医护先烈们永垂不朽。
