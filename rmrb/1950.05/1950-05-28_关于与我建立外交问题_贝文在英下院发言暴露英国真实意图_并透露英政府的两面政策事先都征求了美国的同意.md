Xinhua News Agency, London, May 27th. According to the British Information Service, British Foreign Secretary Bevin spoke in the House of Commons on the 24th regarding the issue of establishing diplomatic relations between China and Britain.

Bevin adopted an extremely unserious attitude towards the major issues raised by the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 22nd of this month, pointing out that the British government had consistently abstained from voting on the issue of Chinese representation in all agencies affiliated with the United Nations for the past five months, and that the British authorities in Hong Kong had detained planes owned by our Central People's Government that were staying in Hong Kong. Bevin said, "What we have received from China is an attempt to specifically look for those small things to annoy and agitate countries like us." While using sophistry to cover up the actions of British representatives using abstentions to support the remnants of the Kuomintang bandits, Bevin attempted to shift the responsibility to the Soviet Union. Bevin said that when the British government "was studying the issue of legal status, the Soviet Union withdrew from the meeting."

Bevin's speech once again exposed the true intentions of the British government in deciding to establish diplomatic relations with our country. Bevin said, "At that time (January 6th), recognizing China and not allowing the Soviet Union to pretend that it was the only one who would deal with China, I believe that this was the right thing to do. Although the decision that we had to recognize the Communist Party may have been an unpleasant one." In his speech, Bevin revealed that the duplicitous policies adopted by the British government had been approved by the US government in advance. Bevin said that he had "discussed the whole issue with Acheson in Washington."

　　关于与我建立外交问题
    贝文在英下院发言暴露英国真实意图
    并透露英政府的两面政策事先都征求了美国的同意
    【新华社二十七日讯】据英国新闻处伦敦二十四日讯，英国外相贝文二十四日在下院曾就中英建立外交问题发言。
    贝文对于我国外交部发言人本月二十二日所指出的英国政府五个月来在联合国所属一切机构中对中国代表权问题上一贯弃权，以及香港英国当局扣押停留在香港的为我国中央人民政府所有的飞机这样的重大问题，采取了极不郑重的态度。贝文说：“我们从中国已经得到的是这样一种企图，即专找寻那些小事情，来使得像我们这样的国家烦恼与激动。”贝文在以诡辩来掩饰英国代表用弃权来支持国民党残匪代表的行动时，企图把责任推到苏联身上。贝文说：英国政府“正在研究法律地位的问题时，苏联就退出了会议。”
    贝文的发言又一次暴露了英国政府在决定与我国建立外交关系一事上的真实意图。贝文这样说：“在那时（一月六日）承认中国、并且不让苏联装作唯一将和中国打交道的就是苏联，我相信这事是对的。虽然我们之必须承认共产党的这样一个决定，可能是一件不惬意的决定。”贝文在他的发言中透露英国政府所采取的两面政策，事前都征求了美国政府的同意。贝文说他“在华盛顿曾和艾奇逊讨论过整个问题”。
