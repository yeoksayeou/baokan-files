　　Fourth Field Army Unit Reclaims 10,000 Mu
　　Now Actively Soaking Rice Seeds and Turning Over Rice Seedling Fields
    [Hankou News] According to the Yangtze River Daily news: A certain unit of the Fourth Field Army stationed in Huangchuan has reclaimed 10,000 mu of wasteland in the past half month and is now seizing the farming season to carry out spring plowing. In early April, after mobilization by each unit, they all threw themselves into the wasteland reclamation production movement with a fighting posture. The directly subordinate organs of the unit reclaimed 1,800 mu in eight days, and the guard battalion reclaimed 800 mu in fourteen days. Those lacking farm tools and plowing cattle automatically pooled money to buy them. A certain regimental political commissar took out a gold ring, and female comrades of the propaganda team, and soldier Li Ping of the Second Machine Gun Platoon, and others voluntarily took out six gold rings in total. The First Battalion concentrated 3 million RMB, enough to buy four large cattle, and the money pooled from allowances was enough to buy nine water buffaloes. The wasteland in Huang (chuan), Guang (shan), Xi (county), and Luo (shan) is mostly abandoned land from ten years ago, with rampant weeds and tree roots, making cultivation very difficult. Comrade Zhang Dianshi of the unit invented adding a blade to the plow, which greatly sped up plowing and saved manpower and animal power. In production, mutual aid and labor exchange were also implemented. Female comrades from the propaganda team and cooks exchanged labor, resulting in two-thirds of the cooks being able to participate in wasteland reclamation. In addition, they also exchanged labor with the local masses, which solved the problem of production tools and plowing cattle on the one hand, and allowed them to learn production knowledge from experienced farmers on the other. At the same time, a large number of labor heroes emerged during the wasteland reclamation. Wei Guangshan of the Fourth Squad of the Third Artillery Company picked the biggest hoe he could find on the first day of wasteland reclamation and worked with great energy, reclaiming the most wasteland. Fan Junshan of the Engineering Company helped the villagers carry water and repair production tools during breaks from wasteland reclamation. As the spring plowing season arrived, each unit launched a fertilizer accumulation competition. The company, platoon, and squad of a certain unit established collective toilets and manure pits in places that did not hinder public health. Li Dechang and Li Lin got up 20 minutes early every day to collect manure. Influenced by this exemplary action, the entire platoon collected 800 jin of manure in one and a half days, and the Fifth Company accumulated ten large carts of fertilizer in three days, and fertilizer accumulation groups were established with the platoon as the unit, making manure collection and digging up green mud from ponds regular tasks in fertilizer accumulation. At present, each unit has made arrangements for spring plowing, seizing the farming season, such as soaking rice seeds to grow seedlings and turning over rice seedling fields to prepare for flooding. At the same time, comrades promoted class brotherhood and sisterhood. The personnel of the unit who remained in the offices economized on food and clothing and used the money saved to improve the lives of the personnel engaged in production, and wrote letters of comfort to the production personnel.

　　四野某部开荒万亩
    现正积极泡稻种翻秧田
    【汉口讯】据长江日报消息：驻潢川的第四野战军某部，半月来已开荒万亩，现正抓紧农时进行春耕。四月初，各单位经过动员后，均以战斗姿态投入开荒生产运动。该部直属机关八天时间即开荒一千八百亩，警卫营十四天开荒八百亩。农具耕牛不足的都自动凑钱购买。某团政委拿出金戒指一只，宣传队的女同志，机枪二连战士李平等共自动拿出金戒指六只。一营集中人民币三百万元可买四头大牛，另外由津贴中凑的钱也能买九头水牛。潢（川）、光（山）、息（县）、罗（山）的荒地多是十年前的熟荒，荒草树根横生，耕种很困难，该部张殿石同志发明了犁上加刀，耕种很快，节省了人力畜力。生产中并实行变工互助，宣传队的女同志和炊事员变工，结果使三分之二的炊事员能抽出参加开荒。另外就是与驻地群众变工，一方面解决生产工具和耕牛问题，一面可向有经验的农民学习生产知识。同时在开荒中，并涌现出大批劳动英雄，炮三连四班韦广山，在开荒的第一天就拣了一把最大的镐用，他干的有劲，开的荒地最多。工兵连范俊山在开荒休息时间，还帮助老乡挑水，修理生产工具。春耕时节到来，各单位又发起积肥竞赛，某部连排班在不妨碍公共卫生的地方建立了集体厕所粪池，李德昌、李林天天早起廿分钟拾粪，在这种模范行动影响下，全排一天半拾粪八百斤，五连三天时间积肥十大车，并以排为单位成立了积肥小组，拾粪、挖淤塘里青污泥成为积肥中的经常工作。现在各单位抓紧农时对春耕都作了安排，如泡稻种下秧芽子，翻秧田准备放水等。同时，同志们互相发扬了阶级友爱，该部留在机关的人员省吃俭用，省下的钱给从事生产的人员改善生活，并写慰问信慰问生产人员。
