[News Dispatch from the Beijing Municipal News Office] To facilitate tax payment for industrial and commercial businesses in each district, the Beijing Tax Bureau has decided to strengthen the work of its subordinate tax bureau branches. To adapt to the current urban district reorganization, it has been decided to establish a tax bureau branch in each administrative district within the city. The original six tax bureau branches in the city will be expanded to nine. This has been submitted to and approved by the Beijing Municipal People's Government and will be implemented with immediate effect. Originally, there were twelve administrative districts in the city, but only six tax bureau branches (with half of the 5th branch's jurisdiction in the suburbs). Merchants and residents often found this inconvenient. Moreover, the scope of each tax bureau branch generally included the jurisdiction of two or three administrative districts. The leadership of the administrative districts over the tax bureau branches was not unified, and the connection between them was not close enough, which to some extent affected the progress and improvement of the business of each tax bureau branch. Now that a tax bureau branch has been established in each district within the city, these shortcomings have been basically overcome.

The ranking and jurisdictional boundaries of the new tax bureau branches are consistent with the new administrative districts. For example, the jurisdictional boundary of the 1st Tax Bureau Branch is the scope of the 1st District. The addresses of each tax bureau branch are listed below:

    Tax 1st Bureau Branch: 42 Zhugan Lane, Chaoyangmen Inner Street (former site of the 5th branch);
    Tax 2nd Bureau Branch: 21 Old Ministry of Justice Street (original site);
    Tax 3rd Bureau Branch: 41 Wangzhima Hutong (former site of the 1st branch);
    Tax 4th Bureau Branch: 6 Sanzuao Bridge, Di'anmen Outer Street (former site of the 8th branch);
    Tax 5th Bureau Branch: Temporarily located at Beijing Hotel, Shuncheng Street, Qianmen Inner Street;
    Tax 6th Bureau Branch: 19 Meishi Street, Qianmen Outer Street (former site of the 4th branch);
    Tax 7th Bureau Branch: 4 Muchang Hutong, Chongwenmen (former site of the 3rd branch);
    Tax 8th Bureau Branch: Beimashen Temple, Guang'anmen Outer Street;
    Tax 9th Bureau Branch: 90 Shitou Hutong, Qianmen Outer Street.

### 便利各区工商业户纳税  城内每区设一税务分局

　　便利各区工商业户纳税
    城内每区设一税务分局
    【京市新闻处讯】京市税务局为加强所属各税务分局的工作，适应目前城区新区划，决定在城内每一行政区设一个税务分局，将城内原有的六个税务分局扩充为九个，已呈奉北京市人民政府批准，自即日起实行，原来城内共有十二个行政区，而税务分局只有六个（其中第五分局辖区还有一半在郊区），商民常感不便，且税务分局所管范围一般都包括二、三个行政区辖区，行政区对税务分局的领导不统一，彼此联系不够密切，也在一定程度上影响了各税务分局业务的进行与改善。现在城内每一个区都设立一个税务分局，便基本上克服了这些缺点。
    新税务分局名次排列及所管境界与新行政区一致，如税务第一分局所管境界即第一区辖区范围。兹将各税务分局地址列下：
    税务第一分局：朝阳门内竹杆巷四十二号（原五分局旧址）；
    税务第二分局：旧刑部街二十一号（原址）；
    税务第三分局：汪芝麻胡同四十一号（原一分局旧址）；
    税务第四分局：地安门外三座桥六号（原八分局旧址）；
    税务第五分局：暂借前门内顺城街北京客栈；
    税务第六分局：前门外煤市街十九号（原四分局旧址）；
    税务第七分局：崇文门木厂胡同四号（原三分局旧址）；
    税务第八分局：广安门外北马神庙；
    税务第九分局：前门外石头胡同九十号。
