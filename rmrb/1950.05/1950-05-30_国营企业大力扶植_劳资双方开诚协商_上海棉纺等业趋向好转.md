　　State-Owned Enterprises Strongly Support · Labor and Management Openly Negotiate
　　Shanghai's Cotton Textile and Other Industries Trend Towards Improvement

　　[Report from this newspaper] According to Shanghai's Liberation Daily and Xinwen Daily reports: Shanghai's private cotton spinning, silk weaving, dyeing, and canvas industries, based on the principle of benefiting both public and private interests, have been vigorously supported by state-owned companies such as the China National Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation, China National Silk Corporation, and Shanghai Trust & Trade Company through methods such as contract spinning, weaving, dyeing, and ordering goods. Additionally, with labor and management in each factory openly negotiating and overcoming difficulties, production has gradually recovered and is trending towards improvement.

　　From May 1st to 20th, the city's private cotton spinning industry signed 31 contract spinning agreements with the state-owned China National Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation. The state-owned company allocated 34,903 dan (unit of weight) of cotton and contracted for 8,521 bales of cotton yarn. The industry is estimated to earn 1,848,295.6 units of real value in processing fees. Before April 20th of this year, the China National Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation had already entrusted private cotton spinning factories to spin a total of over 27,400 bales of cotton yarn. The industry supplied 12,521 bales of cotton yarn to the China National Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation for consignment sales. In addition, the company made short-term orders and temporary acquisitions of over 37,000 bales of cotton yarn. In total, more than two-thirds of cotton spinning factories in the city have established relationships with the China National Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation through contract processing, ordering, and acquisition.

　　With the assistance of the People's Government and state-owned enterprises, and through the continuous efforts of labor and management, production has been steadily increasing. Statistics as of the end of April showed that 957,212 spindles were actually in operation in 39 factories, and 5,988 looms were in use. According to statistics from the fourth week of April, the average yarn production of 20-count yarn per spindle for 20 hours had increased to 0.794 pounds, surpassing the average yarn production of 0.779 pounds on May 25th of last year, setting a new record since liberation. Production continued to increase in May. Yarn and cloth production also increased, with yarn at 6,639 bales and cloth at 38,060 bolts. As unit production efficiency increased, the cost also decreased relatively.

　　In some yarn factories, labor and management have engaged in open negotiation, with the management accepting opinions to improve business operations and actively raising funds. This has enabled them to overcome difficulties and maintain production. For example, in the case of De Feng Yarn Factory, the management had previously suffered from poor internal management, low enthusiasm for production, and irresponsible staff, resulting in very low production efficiency. Difficulties were exacerbated after the "February 6th" KMT bombing. However, since labor and management engaged in open negotiation, workers voluntarily changed their rice wages from superior white rice to medium white rice, guaranteeing a monthly savings of 32,900 units. The management actively raised funds to purchase raw materials, undertake contract spinning, and issue back wages. This greatly increased the production enthusiasm of the workers, and production reached 0.86 pounds for 20-count yarn (20 hours), exceeding the management's requirement of 0.8 pounds and breaking the factory's historical production record. As a result, production was maintained. The difficulties faced by some yarn factories that have always operated conservatively have decreased further. For example, Yong'an Yarn Factory has a unified organizational structure, with the five factories directly managed by the head office. They have unified purchasing of materials, unified expenditures, and streamlined personnel. Furthermore, profits earned in the past were not distributed casually but were reinvested in production, resulting in a more substantial capital base. The factory is currently establishing a new labor-management relationship that is "equal, voluntary, mutually beneficial, and contractual" in order to further improve production.

　　In addition, the Shenxin Yarn Factory previously had difficulties due to the fact that the various factories did not communicate with each other, operating independently and with bloated organizational structures. The factory has now begun to reform, establishing a "General Management Office" on the 8th of this month to unify management and streamline the organization, moving towards enterprise-based management. These are all good examples of Shanghai yarn factories overcoming difficulties.

　　The silk weaving industry has accepted a large number of contract weaving tasks from the China National Silk Corporation over the past year. Including private silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, a total of 158 silk factories accepted contract weaving tasks, weaving 15,655.5 bolts of export silk and operating 1,095 looms. From May 1st to 23rd, 61 private silk factories in Shanghai signed contracts with the China National Silk Corporation using the method of exchanging silk for silk, where the silk factories first handed over bolts of export silk, and then the company issued raw materials and processing fees for contract weaving. These 61 silk factories contracted to weave 10,763 bolts of silk. In order to do a good job of contract weaving, labor and management openly negotiated on the 17th of last month and established a consultation committee. The labor side took into account the difficulties of the management, greatly boosting the management's confidence in production. Currently, 10 factories including Hong Chang and Liu He are actively engaged in production. Production is also progressing in other factories through open negotiation between labor and management.

　　From May 1st to 20th, the dyeing industry also accepted the following contract weaving and dyeing tasks from the China National Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation: (1) 31 contract weaving agreements, with the state-owned company allocating 3,848 pieces of cotton and contracting for 137,491 bolts of cotton cloth, earning 1,210,688.8 units of real value in processing fees. (2) 13 contract dyeing agreements, dyeing 41,600 bolts of cotton cloth, earning 468,100 units of real value in processing fees. (3) One contract weaving and dyeing agreement, with the state-owned company allocating 32 pieces of cotton and contracting for 2,728 bolts of dyed cotton cloth, earning 53,196 units of real value in processing fees. Before May 20th, the China National Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation had already entrusted the contract weaving of over 377,300 bolts of 12-pound fine cloth, over 151,200 bolts of poplin and twill cloth, 267,500 bolts of mosquito net cloth, and 170,000 bolts of dyed cloth. In sales operations, private dyeing factories supplied 42,080 bolts of cotton cloth. In addition, the China National Cotton Yarn & Cloth Corporation made short-term orders and temporary acquisitions of a total of 1,057,677 bolts of cotton cloth.

　　Since liberation, the canvas industry has been doing better than any other industry due to the steady stream of orders from state-owned economic institutions, with orders consistently maintaining around 80% of the industry's output. Due to a surge in orders this month, 13 of the industry's 15 factories are currently operating simultaneously, with over a hundred canvas looms in operation. Monthly production of thick canvas has exceeded 200,000 yards. The Shanghai Trust & Trade Company has placed two batches of orders this month, with all orders scheduled to be cleared in three batches on the 20th and 31st of this month and the 10th of next month. Prior to these orders, the industry had received around 800,000 yards of canvas in public orders. Including the orders this month, orders have exceeded one million yards. There are also no issues with raw materials. However, the weft yarn of the produced thick canvas must reach 22 strands to meet the standard. Only one or two factories in the industry are close to this standard, and the rest of the factories still need to work hard.

　　国营企业大力扶植·劳资双方开诚协商
    上海棉纺等业趋向好转
    【本报讯】据上海解放日报、新闻日报讯：上海市私营棉纺、丝织、染织、帆布等轻工业，由于国营花纱布、蚕丝、贸易信托等公司，本公私兼顾原则，积极以代纺、代织、代染及订货等方式，大力加以扶植，和在各该厂劳资双方开诚协商、克服困难的情况下，生产已得以逐步恢复和趋向好转。
    该市私营棉纺业自五月一日至二十日止，即与国营花纱布公司签订代纺合约三十一份，由国营公司配售棉花三四、九○三市担，代纺棉纱八、五二一件；该业计可得工缴费一、八四八、二九五·六个折实单位。又花纱布公司在本年四月二十日以前，曾经委托私营棉纺业厂商代纺棉纱共二七、四○○余件，该业供给花纱布公司代销之棉纱达一二、五二一件。另外该公司作短期订货及临时收购之棉纱又达三七、○○○余件。总计全市棉纺业厂家有三分之二以上，均与花纱布公司建立了委托加工、定货、收购等关系。
    经过人民政府和国营企业的扶助，该业劳资双方又不断努力，因而生产日见上升。截至四月底统计：三十九家实开纱锭为九五七、二一二枚，实用布机五、九八八台。又据四月第四周统计，二十支纱每锭二十小时的平均产纱量，已增至零点七九四磅，超过了去年五月二十五日的平均产纱量零点七七九磅，创造了解放后的新纪录。五月份还在不断增高中。纱布产量亦已增加，纱为六、六三九件，布为三八、○六○匹，单位生产效率提高后，其成本也相对的减低了。
    有些纱厂，劳资开诚协商，资方接受意见改进经营方式，积极筹款，终能克服困难，维持生产。如德丰纱厂，过去内部经营不善，资方生产情绪不高，职员不负责任，生产效率甚低，“二、六”匪机轰炸后困难更为严重，但自劳资双方开诚协商，职工自愿将工资米由上白粳改中白粳，保证每月节省三万二千九百个单位，资方积极筹款收购原料，进行代纺，发出欠薪，从而使职工生产积极性益形提高，生产由二十支纱（二十小时）达到零点八六磅，超出资方零点八磅要求，打破该厂历来的生产纪录，终于维持了生产。某些一向作风稳健的纱厂，今日的困难更见减少。如永安系纱厂，机构组织统一，五个厂由总公司直接管理，统一购料，统一开支，人事精简，又因过去所得利润，不随便分配，仍投资在生产事业上，所以资金较充实。目前该厂正在建立“平等的、自愿的、两利的、契约的”新的劳资关系，以求进一步搞好生产。
    另有申新系纱厂，过去各厂经营互不通气，各自为政，机构臃肿，以致经营困难。现该厂开始改革，已于本月八日成立“总管理处”统一管理，精简机构，走向企业化的经营。这些都是上海有困难的纱厂进行克服困难的很好榜样。
    丝织业在过去一年中曾大量接受中国蚕丝公司的代织任务，连同苏、浙等地之私营绸厂在内，接受代织任务的绸厂达一五八家之多，代织外销绸一五、六五五匹半，开动织机一、○九五台。自本月一日至二十三日止，沪市私营绸厂又有六一家接受中国蚕丝公司的以绸易丝办法，签订了合同，先由绸厂缴出外销绸匹，再由公司发给原料及工缴代织。该六一家绸厂共代织绸一○、七六三匹。该业为做好代织任务，劳资双方曾于上月十七日开诚协商，并成立协商会。劳方照顾资方困难，使资方生产信心大为提高，现已有洪昌、六合等十个厂正积极进行生产。其他各厂亦在劳资双方开诚协商下，使生产日趋进展。
    染织业自本月一日起至二十日止，亦接受花纱布公司如下几项代织、代染任务：（一）代织合约三一份，由国营公司配棉三、八四八件，代织棉布一三七、四九一匹，可得工缴费一、二一○、六八八·八个折实单位。（二）代染合约一三份，代染棉布四一、六○○匹，可得工缴费四六八、一○○个折实单位。（三）代织染合约一份，国营公司配棉三二件，代织染棉布二、七二八匹，可得工缴费五三、一九六个折实单位。又在本月二十日以前，花纱布公司即已委托代织一二磅细布三七七、三○○余匹，府绸及斜纹布一五一、二○○余匹，蚊帐布二六七、五○○匹，代染色布一七○、○○○匹。在供销业务中，由私营染织厂供销棉布四二、○八○匹。另外，花纱布公司又曾作短期订货与临时收购共计棉布一、○五七、六七七匹。
    帆布业在解放以来，因获得国营经济机构的源源订货，且订货经常维持该业产量的百分之八十左右，故较其他任何工业为佳。本月来由于订货激增，该业共一五家工厂，已有一三家同时开工生产，开动帆布机百余台，厚帆布产量每月已超过二十万码。上海贸易信托公司在本月内即先后订货两批，所有订货规定在本月二十日、三十一日及下月十日，分三批缴清。在这批订货以前，该业曾获公营订货计帆布八十万码左右；连同本月订货在内，所获订货业已逾百万码。原料方面也无问题。惟所产厚帆布纬纱需达二二根始合标准，该业除一两家厂能接近此标准外，其余各厂均尚待努力。
