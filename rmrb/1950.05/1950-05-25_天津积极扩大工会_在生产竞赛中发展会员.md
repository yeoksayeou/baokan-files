Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 24th: The Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions, based on the decisions of the National Trade Union Organizational Work Conference and Tianjin's current specific circumstances, decided at its executive committee meeting on the 22nd that by the end of June, it would complete the adjustment and establishment of nine industrial unions: light industry, food industry, postal and telecommunications, construction, news publishing and printing, cultural and artistic workers, finance and banking, education workers, and government employees. The original twelve industrial unions, including railways, seamen, shop assistants, municipal administration, and textiles, will remain unchanged. The central task of Tianjin's trade union organizational work in the future is to rapidly organize the 30 percent of the city's workers who have not yet joined trade unions through the current production emulation movement; at the same time, consolidate the existing grassroots trade union organizations.
