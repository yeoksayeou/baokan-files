Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch:

　　More than five thousand eight hundred immigrants from Liangshan County, a severely affected area in Pingyuan Province, received by the Northeast People's Government in March of this year, have now been properly settled in Heilongjiang and Songjiang Provinces, and have been promptly assisted in entering spring plowing production.

　　Before the immigration, the Pingyuan Provincial People's Government formulated a specific plan for the immigration work in advance, and established an immigration committee in Liangshan County to carry out full publicity, education, and organizational work for the immigrants; the Northeast People's Government's Department of Agriculture and Forestry and the Department of Civil Affairs also held a meeting on receiving immigrants in Songjiang and Heilongjiang Provinces, making preparations for receiving immigrants in advance.

　　At the beginning of the migration, the Pingyuan and Northeast local people's governments respectively set up many reception stations in Tai'an, Jinan, Shanhaiguan, Shenyang, Changchun and other places, giving the immigrants considerate care along the way. Cadres and doctors were also sent along with the trains to escort them, thus making the transportation of immigrants very smooth.

　　After more than five thousand eight hundred immigrants arrived in the Northeast, the Northeast People's Government settled more than four thousand seven hundred of them in Shangzhi, Fangzheng, Wuchang, and Tangyuan counties in Songjiang Province, and the other more than one thousand one hundred people were settled in Qing'an, Keshan, and Yi'an counties in Heilongjiang Province. In order to help immigrants settle down and produce, the Northeast People's Government decided that, in addition to the local authorities specifically solving the immigrants' land issues, each household would be given a loan of 1,250 jin of food for five months, as well as settlement funds and summer housing material costs (calculated at one and a half rooms) equivalent to 1,000 jin of food. Every two households (averaging five people per household) would be lent 600 jin of seeds and a plowing horse, and every twelve households would be lent a cart, a western plow, and three million Northeast currency. After obtaining the above living and production materials, the immigrants in various places have begun spring plowing production.

　　东北接收平原移民五千余
    妥善安置并及时帮助生产
    【新华社二十一日讯】东北人民政府今年三月接收的平原省重灾区梁山县移民五千八百余人，现已妥善安置在黑龙江、松江两省，并已及时帮助他们进入春耕生产。
    在移民前，平原省人民政府预先拟定了移民工作的具体方案，并在梁山县成立了移民委员会，向移民进行了充分的宣传、教育和组织工作；东北人民政府农林部和民政部也召开了松江、黑龙江两省接收移民工作会议，事先作好接收移民的准备工作。
    在开始迁移时，平原和东北两地人民政府分别在泰安、济南、山海关、沈阳、长春等地设立了许多招待站，沿途予移民以妥贴的照顾，列车上还派有干部和医师随车护送，因此使运送移民工作甚为顺利。
    当五千八百余移民到达东北后，东北人民政府即将其中四千七百余人安置在松江省尚志、方正、五常、汤原四县，另外的一千一百余人安置在黑龙江省的庆安、克山、依安三县。为了扶助移民安家生产，东北人民政府决定除由各地具体解决移民土地外，并对每户贷发五个月食粮一千二百五十斤及安家费和夏季盖房材料费（按一间半计算）折合食粮一千斤，每两户（每户平均按五人计算）贷发籽种六百斤和耕马一匹，每十二户贷发大车一辆，洋犁一付和东北币三百万元。各地移民在获得上述生活和生产资料后，均已开始进行春耕生产。
