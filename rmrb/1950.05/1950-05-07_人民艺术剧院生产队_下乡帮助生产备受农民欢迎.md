　　People's Art Theater Production Team
    Goes to the Countryside to Help Production, Highly Welcomed by Farmers
    [This Newspaper] To learn agricultural production techniques and experience the lives of working people, the Beijing People's Art Theater organized a 50-person production team to assist farmers in agricultural production in Balizhuang, East Suburb. After arriving in Balizhuang on April 10th, the team joined various agricultural production mutual aid groups, assisting farmers who lacked labor, especially families of military personnel and widowers, in reclaiming wasteland, hoeing land, carrying soil, building embankments, and sowing seeds after rain. Some comrades also did work such as delivering manure, fertilizing, and watering gardens. Some comrades also helped farmers repair houses. Because the comrades had high enthusiasm for labor, consciously cherished agricultural tools and seedlings, humbly learned production techniques from the villagers, and followed instructions, they were generally welcomed and cared for by the villagers. Sun Hongyi, the head of an agricultural production mutual aid group, said, "You are here to help us, we must work even harder, otherwise we would really be letting down Chairman Mao!" The comrades gained a lot in the process of production and labor, gradually understanding the countryside, learning about the land reform situation, and deeply experiencing the truth that labor creates the world. A comrade from a landlord family said, "I only knew about collecting rent before, but now I know that grain is exchanged for blood and sweat!" After completing the spring plowing task in the village, the team returned to the theater a few days ago. It is planned to form another factory work team to work in factories soon.

    下乡帮助生产备受农民欢迎
    【本报讯】北京人民艺术剧院为了学习农业生产技术，体验劳动人民生活，曾组织了一个五十人的生产队，赴东郊八里庄协助农民生产。该队于四月十日抵八里庄后，即参加各生产互助组，协助缺乏劳动力的农民特别是军属鳏寡户开荒、镐地、抬土、垒堰及雨后豁地播种，部分同志还做了送粪、施肥、浇园等工作。有的同志还协助农民修理房屋。由于同志们劳动热情很高，自觉地爱护农具、田苗，虚心地向老乡学习生产技术，并听从指导，受到老乡们普遍欢迎及爱护。生产互助组小组长农民孙鸿仪说：“你们来帮助我们，我们自己更得多干活，不然真对不起毛主席！”同志们在生产劳动过程收获很大，逐步认识了农村，知道了土改的情况，并深刻体验了劳动创造世界这一真理。一个地主家庭出身的同志说：“以前只知道收租，现在才知道粮食是血汗换来的！”该队在该村春耕任务完成后，于日前返院。并拟不久另组下厂工作队下工厂工作。
