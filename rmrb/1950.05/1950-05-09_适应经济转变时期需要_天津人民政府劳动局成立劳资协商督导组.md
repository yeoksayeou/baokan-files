Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 8th. In order to adapt to the current economic situation changes, to assist private industrial and commercial labor and management to overcome the temporary difficulties in victory, and to universally establish labor-management consultation meetings in various industries or factories and shops, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau decided to adopt a new working method - establishing a labor-management consultation supervision work group. This work group is led by the Labor Bureau, with representatives from the Federation of Trade Unions, the Industry and Commerce Bureau, and relevant trade unions and trade associations participating. If a certain industry has many problems, the work group will go to assist in solving them. When the problems are basically resolved, the work group will end its work in that industry. As for the implementation of the agreement, it still needs the approval of the Labor Bureau to be effective.

    天津人民政府劳动局成立劳资协商督导组
    【新华社天津八日电】为着适应目前经济情况的转变，协助私营工商业劳资双方克服胜利中的暂时困难，进而普遍地在各行业或工厂及商店中建立劳资协商会议，天津市人民政府劳动局决定采取新的工作方式——成立劳资协商督导工作组。这一工作组由劳动局领导，总工会、工商局及有关工会、同业公会派人参加。如某行业存在问题较多，工作组即往协助解决。待问题基本上得到解决时，工作组即结束在该行业的工作。至于协议的实行，仍需劳动局批准，方为有效。
