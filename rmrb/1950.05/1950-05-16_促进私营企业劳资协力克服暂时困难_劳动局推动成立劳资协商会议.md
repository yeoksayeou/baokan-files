　　Promote Labor-Management Cooperation in Private Enterprises to Overcome Temporary Difficulties
　  Labor Bureau Promotes Establishment of Labor-Management Consultation Meetings
    [Beijing News Agency Dispatch] In order to vigorously promote the establishment of labor-management consultation meetings in various private enterprises, and to promote labor-management cooperation to overcome the current temporary difficulties, the Beijing Labor Bureau has successively convened representatives of labor and management from industries and factories/shops such as mechanized flour, machine-made paper, Chinese medicine, weaving and dyeing, and Housheng Match Factory, to hold mobilization meetings. The meetings called on both labor and management in each industry to establish labor-management consultation meetings as soon as possible.
    At the mobilization meetings, Deputy Director Ma Guangdou of the Labor Bureau, in addition to explaining that the labor-management consultation meeting is an institution to facilitate both parties in resolving specific issues related to improving production and operations and employee benefits, also emphasized that the current difficulties in industry and commerce are unavoidable temporary phenomena after the emergence of a new situation of stable prices, and that these difficulties can be gradually overcome. This issue should be the main content of the current consultations after the establishment of the consultation meetings. Manufacturers in various industries should adopt different methods based on specific circumstances: (1) For industries where business conditions were good before price stability, the scope of operation meets the current needs of the people, and there is still future development, but sales are temporarily sluggish, the focus of consultation should be on how to reduce waste, increase output, and reduce costs; generally, wage reductions should not be emphasized. (2) For those with development prospects but currently experiencing sluggish product sales and business depression, resulting in semi-shutdown, labor and management should focus on discussing how to improve management, reorganize business, and seek development; among them, if the business situation is indeed deteriorating, leading to increasing losses, both parties can negotiate a moderate reduction in wages, but it must not be lower than the minimum wage standards stipulated in collective contracts or temporary agreements, or adopt methods such as rotating home production. If labor and management have disputes over a certain issue in the consultation meeting and cannot resolve it, they can apply to the Labor Bureau for mediation or arbitration at any time in accordance with the provisions of the labor dispute resolution procedures.

　　促进私营企业劳资协力克服暂时困难
　  劳动局推动成立劳资协商会议
    【京市新闻处讯】为大力推动各私营企业建立劳资协商会议，并促进劳资双方协力渡过目前暂时困难，京市劳动局已先后召集了机制面粉、机器造纸、国药、织染、厚生火柴厂等行业工厂、商店的劳资双方代表，分别举行动员大会，号召各该行业的劳资双方尽速设立劳资协商会议。
    在动员会议上，劳动局马光斗副局长除说明了劳资协商会议是便于双方解决有关改进生产业务与职工待遇各项具体问题的机构外，并着重指出：当前工商业的困难，是物价平稳的新局面出现后，不可避免的暂时现象，这些困难是完全可以逐步克服的。这一问题应是协商会议成立后目前协商的主要内容。各行业厂商在协商时应根据具体情况，采取不同办法：（一）在物价平稳前营业情况好，经营范围合乎人民当前的需要，今后仍有发展，只是暂时销路不畅的行业，协商内容应以如何减少浪费，增加产量，降低成本为主；一般不应强调减低工资。（二）有发展前途、但目前产品滞销、营业萧条陷于半停工状态的，劳资双方应着重讨论如何改善经营，整理业务，以图发展；其中有营业情况确实恶劣因而亏累日增的，双方可以协商酌减工资，但不得低于集体合同、临时协议所规定的最低工资标准，或采用轮流回家生产等办法，劳资双方在协商会议中，如果对某一问题发生争议而无法解决时，则可按照劳资争议解决程序的规定，随时申请劳动局进行调解或仲裁。
