　　Hebei Discovers Wheat Yellow Dwarf Disease
    Ministry of Agriculture Calls for Variety Selection as Prevention
    [Xinhua News Agency, 24th] Wheat in the central and eastern regions of Hebei Province has recently experienced outbreaks of yellow dwarf disease and wheat sawfly infestations. The Hebei Provincial People's Government is leading the people in control and treatment efforts. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has also instructed all regions to pay attention to pre-harvest variety selection to prevent the spread of the disease next year.
    Hebei has experienced well-distributed rainfall this spring. Additionally, under the call of the People's Government, farmers have paid attention to deep plowing, meticulous cultivation, and fertilization. This year, wheat seedlings are developing exceptionally well, promising a bumper harvest. According to the current damage caused by yellow dwarf disease and wheat sawflies, the impact is still not significant. However, these two pests, especially yellow dwarf disease, are continuing to spread. In severely affected areas, such as parts of Hejian and Gaoyang counties, wheat fields are set to experience reduced yields, thus warranting close attention.
    Yellow dwarf disease, also known as yellow rust, is a type of wheat rust disease caused by the yellow dwarf disease fungus. The fungus parasitizes weeds in wheat fields, and is easily spread in humid and hot weather. Therefore, the areas where yellow dwarf disease is prevalent this year are mostly areas that were flooded last autumn and have low-lying, damp terrain. Countries have yet to find effective treatments for this disease. Emphasis should be placed on prevention, and the currently effective measure is variety selection. Chinese wheat varieties resistant to yellow dwarf disease include "Youzi Mai" (currently planted in Hebei and Pingyuan provinces), "No. 438 Wheat" (also known as "Red Calabash Head Wheat," currently planted in the Xuzhou area), "No. 99 Wheat," "No. 72 Wheat," "Alkali-resistant Wheat," "Rye," "Red Bald Wheat," and "Barley," with the first two having the strongest disease resistance. The Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has instructed Hebei, Pingyuan, Shandong and other places to pay attention to the selection and harvesting of such varieties, and to pay attention to storage (if necessary, mix seeds with DDT powder) for promotion in low-lying areas.

### 河北发现小麦黄疸病  农业部号召选种预防

　　河北发现小麦黄疸病
    农业部号召选种预防
    【新华社二十四日讯】河北省中部和东部地区的小麦，最近多发生黄疸病害和麦叶蜂虫害，河北省人民政府正领导人民进行除治工作，中央人民政府农业部亦已指示各地注意麦收前选种工作以预防来年蔓延。
    河北今春雨水调匀，加以农民在人民政府号召下，注意了深耕细作和施肥，今年麦苗发育状况极好，可望丰收。按目前黄疸病和麦叶蜂的为害情况，影响还不大。但上述病虫两害特别是黄疸病正在继续蔓延中，严重地区如河间、高阳两县的部分麦田势将减产，因此值得严密注意。
    黄疸病亦名黄锈病，为小麦锈病的一种，由黄疸病菌传染而生。病菌奇生于麦地杂草，气候潮热极易传布。故今年发生黄疸病害地区多为去秋曾经水淹及地势低湿之地区。各国对此病害尚无有效除治办法。应重视预防，目前有效的措施即为选种。我国抗黄疸的小麦麦种计有蚰子麦（现河北、平原两省均有种植）、四三八号麦（即红葫芦头麦，现徐州一带种植）、九九号麦、七二号麦、抗碱麦、黑麦、红秃头麦及大麦，尤以前两种抗病力最强。中央人民政府农业部已指示河北、平原、山东等地注意选收此类品种，并注意收藏（必要时以ＤＤＴ粉拌种），备作低湿地区推广之用。
