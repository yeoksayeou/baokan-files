　　Heilongjiang Province Promotes Production and Sales Contracts
　　Expanding the Scope of State-Owned Commercial Purchases and Sales
　　Promoting the Rapid Development of Cooperative Undertakings

　　[This newspaper Heilongjiang News] State-owned commerce and cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province have achieved great success in their business operations by widely adopting the new method of signing production and sales contracts.

　　The implementation of the contract system in the province began in November last year. At a joint meeting of directors of county federations of cooperatives and managers of county trading companies on April 23 this year, a summary of the implementation of the contract system in the first quarter of this year was made, and several improvement measures were proposed.

　　It is estimated that cooperatives and state-owned commercial departments in the province signed a total of 12,282 contracts of various sizes in January, February, and March, with a total transaction value of 923.9 million (Northeast currency, same below), accounting for approximately 70% of the total transaction value of cooperatives in the province, 46% of the transaction value of state-owned commerce which was 2,008.5 million, and 15% of the total market transaction value of 6,156.3 million. From this, it can be seen that cooperatives played a significant role in supply and sales transactions. For example, in the fourth quarter of last year, state-owned commerce sold 35% of its total sales of general merchandise through cooperatives, purchased 31% of its total grain, and 30% of its total local products. In the first quarter of this year, these figures increased to 43% for general merchandise sales, 45% for grain purchases, and 50% for local product purchases. This greatly expanded retail sales, accelerated the circulation of goods, and made cooperatives a powerful assistant to the national economy. For example, Gannan County Cooperatives strictly implemented the contract system, selling 80% of the general merchandise sold for state-owned commerce and purchasing 90% of the grain.

　　In these purchase and sale transactions, the cooperatives themselves have also greatly developed. At the end of last year, the capital of cooperatives in the province was 210 billion, with 165 new cooperatives and an increase of 11.3 billion in capital. By the end of March, when the accounts were settled, the capital of cooperatives in the province reached 355 billion, an increase of 63%. The main source of this increase was the accumulation from purchasing and selling on behalf of the state. For example, the Sicun Village Cooperative in Taian District, Anda County, had capital of 17 million at the end of last year, and it increased to 97 million by the end of March, accumulating 570% in capital; the average turnover of funds was 11 times per month, and all transactions were carried out under contract with state-owned commerce. In the past, in order to support cooperatives, state-owned commerce followed price increases but not decreases when purchasing, and followed both price increases and decreases when selling. The prices stipulated in the contracts guaranteed a certain profit for the cooperatives, thus allowing them to boldly engage in business operations.

　　Furthermore, because the contracts stipulate specific specifications and standards for purchased and sold goods, the quality of sideline and handicraft products of small producers has also been directly improved. Moreover, most of the contracts signed are small contracts with short durations and small quantities, and everything is carried out according to plan, making it easier to maintain credit. This has overcome the past phenomena of blind operation and mutual buck-passing. Business skills have also improved, and the sense of responsibility of cadres has been strengthened.

　　Of course, there are still some deviations in the current contract operations. For example, some state-owned commercial cadres believe that cooperatives should complete tasks, and that shipping the goods to the cooperatives is the end of the matter; some cooperative cadres also regard the contract system as a means of obtaining credit, and do not pay attention to whether the tasks are completed or not. This naturally reduces the credibility of the contract system.

　　Secondly, in a few counties, the principle of small contracts with short durations and small quantities was not implemented when signing contracts. Instead, large, comprehensive contracts were signed at the county level, resulting in stockpiling of materials, sluggish capital turnover, and endless disputes when prices rose and fell, leading to the failure to complete the task of recovering funds. For example, the state-owned commerce in Suihua County signed a three-month large-scale sales and purchase contract with the county federation of cooperatives, which included the guaranteed sale of 13,700 bolts of cloth. As a result, materials were frozen, the contract became a mere formality, and endless disputes arose.

　　In addition, there are unreasonable aspects in price regulations. For example, in order to support cooperatives, the interests of the state are often overlooked, and the interests of the masses are unilaterally taken care of, fostering the erroneous view among some cooperatives that they can stockpile materials and sign large contracts because they will never suffer losses anyway.

　　The above-mentioned biases have attracted the attention of leaders in various regions. At the beginning of this month, the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government Committee, in light of the current basic situation of promoting the contract system, decided to further vigorously promote the contract system throughout the province in order to strengthen the planned nature of the state-owned commercial and cooperative economy. During the promotion, the experience of implementing the contract should be summarized at any time. (Liu Yu Chen)

### 黑龙江省推广产销合同　扩大国营商业购销范围　促进合作事业迅速发展

　　黑龙江省推广产销合同
　　扩大国营商业购销范围     
    促进合作事业迅速发展
    【本报黑龙江讯】黑龙江省国营商业与合作社，在业务经营上，广泛采用签订产销合同的新方法，已取得很大成就。
    该省合同制的推行于去年十一月即已开始，在今年四月二十三日全省县联社主任与各县贸易公司经理联席会议上，特别对今年第一季度的合同制推行情况作了总结，并提出了若干改进办法。
    计该省一、二、三月份全省合作社与国营商业部门共订立过大小合同一二、二八二次，总计交易额九、二三九亿（东北币，下同），占全省合作社交易总额的百分之七十左右，占国营商业交易额二○、○八五亿的百分之四十六，占整个市场交易额六一、五六三亿的百分之十五，由此可以看出合作社在供销交易上是起了很大作用的。如去年第四季度国营商业通过合作社推销百货占其总推销额的百分之三十五，收购粮食占总收购额百分之三十一，收购土产占总额百分之三十。而今年第一季度则增加到百货推销占百分之四十三，粮食收购占百分之四十五，土产收购占百分之五十，这就大大扩大了零售，加速了商品流转，使合作社真正成为国家经济的有力助手。如甘南全县合作社严格执行了合同制，为国营商业推销的百货占其推销总额的百分之八十，收购粮食占百分之九十。
    就在这些购销业务中，合作社本身亦得到很大发展。去年底全省合作社资金二、一○○亿，新增合作社一六五个，增加资金一一三亿，到三月末结算时，全省合作社资金达到三、五五○亿，增加了百分之六十三。其来源主要即是为国家代购代销而积累起来的。其中如安达县太安区四村村社，去年底资金一、七○○万元，三月末增加到九、七○○万元，积累资金百分之五百七十；每月平均资金周转十一次，且全部交易都是与国营商业订立合同而进行的。国营商业过去为了扶助合作社，在收购价格变动时，是随涨不随落，推销价格变动时，是随涨随落。在合同上规定的价格保证了合作社一定的利润，因而使合作社可以放手大胆经营业务。
    又由于合同规定购销货物有一定的规格标准，也直接提高了小生产者副业与手工业产品的质量。且所订合同大体上多是时间短、数量少的小型合同，一切按计划进行，信用也容易保持，这就克服了过去盲目经营及互相扯皮等现象。而在业务技术上亦提高了，干部的责任心也加强了。
    当然在目前合同经营当中，依然还是存在着若干偏差的。如有部分国营商业干部，认为合作社应该完成任务，货推到合作社去就算完事；部分合作社干部也有把合同制认为是赊取货款的手段，任务完成与否却不重视。这样就自然降低了合同制的信用。
    其次是有少数县在订立合同时，没有贯彻时间短，数量少的小型合同的原则，而是以县为单位订大尾巴合同，因而发生了物资积压、资金周转不灵、物价涨落时纠纷不止，致回笼任务不能完成等现象。如绥化县国营商业与县联社订了三个月的包销包购大合同，其中布即包销一三、七○○匹，结果物资冻结、合同徒具形式，且互相争论不止。
    另外，在价格规定上也有不合理处。如为了扶助合作社，往往忽视了国家利益，片面照顾群众利益，助长了某些合作社积压物资、订大合同，以为反正什么时候也不会吃亏的错误观点。
    以上这些偏向均已引起各地领导上的注意。本月初，该省人民政府委员会，并针对目前推行合同制的基本情况，决定今后要在全省进一步大力推行合同制，以加强国营商业及合作社经济的计划性。并在推行中，随时总结执行合同的经验。（刘雨辰）
