　　Implementing Unified Issuance of Materials
　　Huolu Can Continue to Save Expenses
　　Cultural and Educational Departments Still Need to Be Frugal
　　[Our Newspaper Huolu News] Under the unified leadership and control of the Huolu Local Finance Budget Management Committee, after three months of implementation, further savings in expenditure can still be achieved. Last year, the county's winter school heating expenses were originally planned to issue 70,228 catties of rice, but after the county government unified the purchase of coal and changed to issuing physical materials, the result was a saving of 26,659 catties. At first, the village expenses and school office expenses of each village all reflected that they were insufficient, but after unified issuance of physical materials, some districts reflected that there was still a surplus. It is now estimated that 66,535 catties of millet can be saved throughout the year. And it only takes one more cadre for the public to handle this work. This not only saves expenses and guarantees supply, but also prevents the possibility of waste due to surplus if physical objects are not issued. At the third meeting of the county's Finance Management Committee in early April, the results of the inspection of the budget implementation of various departments also revealed that there were cases of waste in individual departments, which mostly occurred in cultural and educational departments, due to a lack of responsible spirit for careful calculation.

　　实行统一核发实物
    获鹿开支可继续节约
    文教部门尚须精打细算
    【本报获鹿讯】获鹿地方财政概算在管委会统一掌握领导下，经过三个月的执行结果，尚可继续节省开支。去年该县冬学烤火费原计划发米七○、二二八斤，后经县府统一买煤改发实物，结果节省了二六、六五九斤。各村村经费、学校办公费，初时均反映不够，后经统一核发实物，有的区即反映还有多余。现估计全年可节省小米六六、五三五斤。而公家办理这一项工作，仅需多添一个干部即可。这样不但节省了开支、保证了供给，且可防止不发实物可能因多余而有浪费现象。该县四月初财政管理委员会第三次会上，进行各部门执行预算情况检查的结果，也发现了个别部门有浪费现象，这多半发生在文教部门，原因是缺乏精打细算的负责精神。
