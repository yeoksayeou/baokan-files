A Literary Work's Depiction of Workers' Lives Did Not Match Reality
Xi'an Auto Workers Offered Criticism
Author and Editors Accepted Criticism and Conducted Self-Criticism
[Xi'an News] The Xi'an Masses Daily published a literary work on the fourth page of the "Masses Literature and Art" weekly on April 9th, issue number 20. It described a worker's enthusiasm for supporting the Liberation War and his active creativity, but the author's depiction of the production process was not realistic. Therefore, the entire workforce of the Northwest Bureau Auto Team wrote a letter to the editors of "Masses Literature and Art" to offer criticism. The author and editors of this work fully accepted the workers' correct criticism and made a self-criticism, which was published on the sixth page of the Masses Daily on April 30th, issue number 23 of "Masses Literature and Art."
The work was titled "Wool Car No. 3721" (A "Wool Car" is a Soviet-made automobile. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, the Soviet Union used these cars to transport military supplies to aid China in its resistance against Japan, covering them with wool on the road, so the masses in the Northwest called these cars "Wool Cars"). The story goes like this: The war was raging fiercely, and the logistics department kept calling the "Seventh District Auto Maintenance Depot" to urge them to send vehicles. All the cars in the factory that could be repaired were repaired and sent out, leaving only Wool Car No. 3721, which was missing a figure-eight wheel and a fan belt. The resident factory representative convened a meeting of all the workers and engineers in the factory one afternoon to try to repair this car, but they couldn't come up with any solutions. After the meeting, worker Wu Youming found a broken figure-eight wheel for a Wool Car in a junk shop in the market. He took it home and repaired it for half the night. He also cut belts from old car tires and sewed them together as a substitute for the fan belt. He took it to the factory, installed it on the car, and tried it out, finding it barely usable. But Wu Youming was afraid that the repaired figure-eight wheel would not be strong enough, so he decided to sand cast a new one. By this time, it was already after three o'clock in the morning. Wu Youming ran to the factory's sand casting room alone, made a sand mold, opened the iron melting furnace, cast the figure-eight wheel, and then took it to the repair shop to turn it. On the hand-cranked lathe, he connected the crank wheel to the front of the bed with a belt, used an iron rod to make a crankshaft to step on with his foot, and turned the wheel while operating the cutting tool, turning the figure-eight wheel. He then took it to install it on the car, and it wasn't even dawn yet. The car was completely repaired, and no one else in the factory knew about it.
The entire workforce of the Northwest Bureau Auto Team, in their letter to the editors of the "Masses Literature and Art" weekly, first expressed their admiration for and willingness to learn from the creative spirit of the protagonist Wu Youming in the work. Then, they explained the properties of the figure-eight wheel, described the procedures required for each production process, and then offered their opinions: For Wu Youming to complete the manufacturing of the sand mold, melting of the iron, pouring of the molten iron, slag removal, care of the sand mold, and then turning it into a finished product all by himself, and to have made a foot-operated crankshaft out of an iron rod, all these production processes and innovative working methods, completed in the short time from three in the morning until dawn, was unimaginable.

        Author's Self-Criticism
        Subjective Imagination of the Production Process
        Damages the Theme's Positive Significance

The author, Hu Yang, expressed his complete acceptance of the criticism offered by the auto team workers and thanked them for their help. The author reviewed the errors he had committed in this work, mainly the subjective emphasis on the positivity of the theme, which led to descriptions that did not conform to reality. The entire production process was described entirely according to his own subjective imagination, which was a dishonest attitude. Because the development of the story was not reasonable, the so-called positive significance of the theme was also damaged. The author wrote: "Now, in retrospect, this is not a simple oversight, but an attitude that is not responsible to the reader."

The editors of "Masses Literature and Art" also made a self-criticism, believing that the opinions of the worker comrades of the Northwest Bureau Auto Team were very good and that they had solved a problem for the editorial department that they could not solve themselves. The self-criticism stated: "When we received Comrade Hu Yang's manuscript, we first considered it from the perspective of the theme. We felt that he had used the character image of Wu Youming to write about the working class's creativity and spirit of overcoming difficulties, and that this spirit should be strongly promoted. But we lacked specific production knowledge, were not familiar with the actual process of machine repair, and therefore were unsure whether Wu Youming could do so many things in one night. We did not take a serious and responsible attitude and ask experienced comrades to help us review it, so we published it hastily." The editors called on literary and art workers to learn from worker comrades, learn from their life experiences and production knowledge, and hoped that readers in various work positions would offer opinions on literary and artistic works and launch a mass literary and art criticism movement.

### 一篇文艺作品描写工人生活不符实际　西安汽车工人提出批评　作者与编者接受批评进行检讨

　　一篇文艺作品描写工人生活不符实际
　　西安汽车工人提出批评
　　作者与编者接受批评进行检讨
    【西安讯】西安群众日报在四月九日第四版《群众文艺》周刊第二十期上，发表了一篇文艺作品，描写一位工人支援解放战争的热情与积极的创造性，但作者描写生产过程不真实。为此，西北局汽车队全体工人写信给《群众文艺》的编者，提出了批评。这篇作品的作者和编者完全接受了工人的正确批评；并作了检讨，发表在四月三十日群众日报第六版《群众文艺》第二十三期上。
    这篇作品题为《三七二一号羊毛车》（羊毛车是一种苏联造的汽车。抗日战争初期，苏联用这种汽车运军火来援助我国抗日，路上用羊毛盖住，因此西北群众就称这种汽车为羊毛车）。故事是这样的：战争在激烈进行，后勤部不断打电话给“七区汽车保育场”催车辆。全厂能修的车都修好开出去了，剩下一辆没有八字轮和风扇皮带的三七二一号羊毛车。住厂代表召集全厂工人和工程人员开了一个下午的会，想修理这辆车子，但一点办法也没想出来。会后工人吴又明在市场上一家卖破烂的铺子里找到了一个破了的羊毛车八字轮，拿回家去修理了半夜，又用旧汽车轮胎上割下的皮带缝成风扇皮带的代用品，拿到工厂里的汽车上按装上去试了一试，勉强可用。但吴又明恐怕修好的八字轮不结实，决心翻砂新造一个。这时已经早晨三点多钟了，吴又明一个人跑到工厂的翻砂间，造好砂模，开了熔铁炉，铸成八字轮，然后拿到修理间去旋。在手摇旋床上，他把摇轮用皮带连到床子跟前，用铁棍做了一个曲轴用脚来踏，一面摇轮一面掌刀子，把八字轮旋好了。再拿去装到车上，这时天还没有亮。汽车全修好了，全厂没有第二个人知道。
    西北局汽车队全体工人在给《群众文艺》周刊编者的信中首先表示佩服并愿意学习作品里面主角吴又明的创造精神。接着，他们又解释了八字轮的性状，说明了每个生产过程所需的手续，然后提出意见：对于吴又明一个人从制造砂模、熔铁、灌汁、打渣、照护砂模，然后去旋成成品，而且用铁棍制成了脚蹬的曲轴，这些生产过程与新创造的工作方法，在由早三点到天亮以前的短时间内就完成了，这是不可想像的事。
            作者自我检讨
            主观想像生产过程
            损害主题积极意义
    作者胡扬，对汽车队工人提出的批评表示完全接受，并感谢他们的帮助。作者检讨了他在这篇作品中所犯的错误，主要是主观强调主题的积极性，而作了不符合实际的描写，完全按照自己主观的想像来描写整个的生产过程，这是一种不老实的态度。由于故事的发展不够入情入理，因此所谓主题的积极意义也受到了损害。作者写道：“现在检讨起来，这不是一种简单的疏忽，而是一种对读者不够负责的态度。”
    《群众文艺》的编者也作了检讨，认为西北局汽车队工人同志的意见很好，并且替编辑部解决了一个自己不能解决的问题。检讨中说：“当我们接到胡扬同志这篇稿件时，我们首先从主题上加以考虑，觉得他通过吴又明这个人物形像，写出了工人阶级的创造性和克服困难的精神，而这种精神，是应该很好提倡的。但我们缺乏具体的生产知识，不熟悉机器修理的实际过程，因此，对于吴又明一晚上能不能做那样多的事情很无把握，而我们又没有采取郑重负责的态度，请有经验的同志帮助看，就草率地发表了。”编者号召文艺工作者向工人同志学习，学习他们的生活经验和生产知识，并希望各种工作岗位上的读者们对文艺作品提意见，展开群众性的文艺批评运动。
