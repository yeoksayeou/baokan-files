　　The Vanguard of Overcoming Disaster

　　Last autumn, the Second Township in the Northern District of Pingmin County, Shaanxi, suffered a severe flood. Due to the simultaneous flooding of the Yellow River, Luo River, and Wei River, more than nine thousand mu of land in the entire township were submerged. Just as they were in distress, the Communist Party and the People's Government proposed production for disaster relief. At that time, some farmers were still afraid of another flood and felt pessimistic and disappointed. Many elderly and middle-aged people held a "fighting a losing battle" mentality.
    At this moment, the Communist Youth League branch of the Second Township actively responded to the call of the Party and the government. Under the leadership of Party and government cadres, they persuaded the masses to participate in drainage work and the construction of thatched huts and sheds. They also vigorously organized young people to participate in various side occupations, mobilizing forty-two young men to form eight side occupation groups, some fishing, some mining coal, some boiling alkali, and others going out to push carts of grain and work as peddlers; in addition, seventy young women were organized into seven groups to engage in weaving. The vigorous, fearless spirit of the young people encouraged the masses' enthusiasm for production to overcome the famine.
    Some side occupation groups quickly achieved good results. For example, the fishing group led by League member Sun Baocheng distributed more than one dou of wheat per person within five days. This made the masses feel even more that as long as everyone took action, there would be a way out.
    Subsequently, through the cadres' tireless persuasion, mutual aid and mutual relief were carried out among the masses. The panic was initially calmed down.
    In February of this year, the government allocated 155 shi of relief grain and loan grain to the township. When distributing this batch of grain, the League branch, in coordination with the Party branch, convened several meetings in advance to study the government's policy of lending grain, reported the situation to the work team, and provided opinions, so that the limited grain was lent out very reasonably and played a role in production for self-salvation. Moreover, the Communist Youth League members demonstrated a spirit of selflessness and serving the collective. For example, female League member Wang Xiuying was elected by the masses as one of the township's production and disaster relief committee members. When the production and disaster relief committee, the work team, and the masses all agreed to lend her five dou of grain, she said: "I still have two jin of cotton, and I can still spin thread for grain. Give this grain to others first, I don't need it..." This exemplary action had a significant impact on the masses. The work of distributing relief and loan grain in the township was quickly completed, and out of the 155 shi of grain, only 45 shi and 3.5 dou were used as relief grain, and the rest were used as loan grain.
    After the grain was lent out, the League members took advantage of the opportunity when the masses had production capital and enthusiasm, on the one hand, assisted the Party and the government in conducting propaganda, mobilizing the masses to prepare for spring plowing and weeding wheat; on the other hand, they persuaded the masses to expand various side occupation production organizations. Now, young people and adults in the township have organized 34 side occupation groups according to the principle of voluntariness, including peddlers, grain sellers, coal miners, fishermen, mat weavers, and medicinal herb diggers, with a total of 236 people participating; in addition, there are four workshop groups operating two tofu shops, two oil presses, and two vermicelli mills. Women in the township, under the leadership of League members Wang Xiuying and Song Chenghua, also formed 41 weaving groups, with a total of 253 participants. Seventy-nine frail elderly people also organized manure collecting groups. In short, the people of the entire township have actively taken action to overcome the disaster and complete this year's major production.
    Because the League branch of the Second Township regards uniting and leading young people and the broad masses to carry out production and disaster relief work as the center of its work, it has won the support of the masses. The masses said: "Joining the Communist Youth League keeps the children busy!" Ma Qiudong's father, who in the past did not allow his son to participate in the youth study group (winter school), now urges his son to participate in League activities. Through this period of production and disaster relief work, the number of League members in the township has increased from seven in December last year to twenty-four now.
    Currently, the League branch of the Second Township, together with the young people and adults of the entire township, is brewing the organization of labor exchange and mutual assistance to carry out spring plowing and weeding wheat.

　　战胜灾荒的先锋队
    ——陕西平民县北区二乡的青年团支部
    董念黎
    去年秋天，陕西平民县北区二乡遭受了严重的水灾。由于黄河、洛水、渭水的同时泛滥，全乡九千多亩土地全部被淹。正在困苦的时候，共产党和人民政府提出了生产救灾。当时，有的农民还怕黄水再来，感到悲观失望。许多老年人和壮年人，抱着一种“打滥仗”的想法。
    这时，二乡的青年团支部积极响应了党与政府的号召，在党、政干部的领导之下，一面说服群众参加排水工作，修盖茅棚草屋；一面又大力组织青年参加各种副业。动员四十二名男青年，组成八个副业小组，有的打鱼，有的挖炭、有的熬碱，还有外出推粮的和作挑担小贩的；另外有七十名青年妇女，编成了七个小组从事纺织。青年人这股蓬蓬勃勃，不怕艰难困苦的勇气，鼓舞了群众生产渡荒的情绪。
    有的副业小组很快就获得了很好的成绩，如以团员孙保成为首组成的打鱼小组，五天之内每人就分到了一斗多麦子。这样，更使群众感觉到只要大家动手就有生路。
    接着，经过干部不倦的说服，群众中开展了互助互济。恐慌的情绪初步安定下来了。
    今年二月，政府拨给该乡救济粮和贷粮一百五十五石。在发放这批粮食时，团支部协同党支部，事先召开了几次会议，研究政府贷发粮食的政策，向工作组反映情况，提供意见，使有限的粮食贷发得非常合理，发挥了生产自救的作用。而且，青年团员表现了舍己为群的精神。如女团员王秀英，被群众推选为乡上的生产救灾委员之一。当生产救灾委员会、工作组和群众都通过要借给她五斗粮食时，她说：“我还有二斤棉花，还可以纺线换粮。把这粮先给别人，我不要……”这一模范行动，在群众中产生了重大影响。该乡的发放救贷粮食的工作很快就完成了，而且在一百五十五石粮食中，只有四十五石三斗五升用作了救济粮，其余都作了借贷粮。
    粮食贷发之后，团员们即趁群众有生产资本与热情的时机，一面协助党和政府进行宣传，发动群众准备春耕锄麦；一面又说服群众，扩大各种副业生产组织。现在，该乡的青年与成年人在一起，按自愿原则，组织了挑担小贩、贩粮、挖炭、打鱼、编席、挖药等副业小组三十四组，共计二百三十六人参加；另外还有四个作坊组，经营豆腐房、油房、粉房各两处。乡里的妇女，也在团员王秀英、宋成花的领导下，组成了四十一个纺织组，参加的共二百五十三人。七十九名体弱的老年人，也组织了拾粪组。总之，全乡的人民都已积极行动起来，为战胜灾荒与完成今年的大生产而努力。
    由于该乡团支部把团结领导青年及广大群众进行生产救灾工作当作是自己的工作的中心，所以它得到群众的拥护。群众说：“参加了青年团，把娃娃弄得不闲咧！”马秋冬的父亲，过去不让他的儿子参加青年学习组（冬学），现在，却督中儿子去参加团的活动了。通过这一段生产救灾工作，该乡团员已由去年十二月的七人发展到现在的二十四人。
    目前，二乡的团支部正和全乡青年与成年人一道，在酝酿着组织变工互助，开展春耕、锄麦。
