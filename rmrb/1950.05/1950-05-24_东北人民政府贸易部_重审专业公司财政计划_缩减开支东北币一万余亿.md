　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 17th: The Trade Department of the Northeast People's Government has re-examined the second-quarter financial plans of its affiliated seven specialized companies, including department stores and grain companies. After careful study, it has reduced expenditures and tightened up basic construction costs, saving a total of 1,490 billion yuan (Northeast currency, same below). Since the second quarter is the off-season for national fiscal revenue, but at the same time requires large investments in industrial construction, the department, in addition to requiring all companies to actively procure materials and accelerate sales to complete and exceed the cash plan turned over to the state, also re-examined the second-quarter expenses and construction project expenditure budgets of each company in late April. As a result of the review, the original tasks of the seven companies remained unchanged, but after careful calculation, the expenditure was reduced from 393 billion yuan to 296 billion yuan. Among them, the packaging costs of each company alone were reduced by more than 300 billion yuan. The grain company originally planned to sell 80,000 tons of edible salt, requiring 3 million straw bags, but after careful calculation, only 540,000 bags were needed, reducing this expenditure budget from the original 60 billion yuan to 10 billion yuan. The result of the review and tightening of the basic construction project budget was to reduce the second-quarter construction budget by more than one-half compared to the previous period.

    重审专业公司财政计划       
    缩减开支东北币一万余亿
    【新华社沈阳十七日电】东北人民政府贸易部重审所属百货、粮食等七个专业公司的第二季度财务计划，经缜密研究，减少经费及紧缩基本工程建设费用，共节省开支一万四千九百亿元（东北币，下同）。由于第二季是国家财政收入的淡季，但同时却要大量投资工业建设，因此该部除要求各公司积极筹办物资，加速推销，争取完成并超过上缴国家现金计划外，还于四月下旬重审各公司第二季度经费及修建工程开支预算。审核结果，七个公司原定任务未动，经费开支经过精打细算，却由三万九千三百亿元减至二万九千六百亿元，其中仅各公司包装费一项，即紧缩三千余亿元；粮食公司原计划推销食盐八万吨需用三百万条草袋子，经细算后只需五十四万条，使此项开支预算由原来六百亿元减至一百亿元。对基本工程修建预算的审核紧缩的结果，使第二季度修建预算较前减少二分之一以上。
