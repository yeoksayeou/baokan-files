    Seriously Implement Cash Management; Bank Deposits Increase Significantly
    [Report from this newspaper] The People's Banks in Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, Datong, and Zhangbei in Chahar Province have strictly implemented cash management, resulting in a significant increase in deposits. After the province's financial conference, each city and county convened joint meetings or forums with departments from the Party, government, military, enterprises, and cooperatives to discuss how to implement the State Council and the People's Bank of China's order on cash management. The branch also dispatched key cadres to assist. When the Zhangjiakou City Business Department convened a meeting on April 18, more than 30 units from provincial and municipal government offices, enterprises, military units, and cooperatives participated. Xuanhua, Datong, and Zhangbei also held meetings on April 16 and 17, with county heads or heads of finance sections participating. All units unanimously expressed their loyal support for the central government's order and their determination to comply with cash management regulations. Due to the diligent compliance of government offices, military units, enterprises, and cooperatives with cash management, the deposit figures of the People's Bank of Chahar Province have increased significantly. The total deposit amount in Zhangjiakou City in mid-April was 134% of the deposits in early April, and the deposit balance on April 24 was 248% of the deposit balance on April 2; in Datong, the deposit balance on April 24 was 158% of the deposit balance on April 2; in Zhangbei, the deposit balance on April 24 was 180% of the deposit balance on April 2; and in Xuanhua, the deposit balance on April 24 was 113% of the deposit balance on April 2.
    Starting from April 20, Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, Datong, Zhangbei, and other counties and cities have successively entered the inspection phase. Each locality, based on its specific circumstances, has organized one to six groups to conduct in-depth inspections of various departments. Necessary persuasion and mobilization were carried out for individual departments to ensure that cash was deposited into the state bank. Among the more than 120 units inspected, none refused inspection, and cash was generally deposited into the treasury on time. Account books and inventories were also made public. In some units where accountants were not proficient, the inspection personnel provided careful assistance.
    Of course, during the inspection, in addition to discovering unsound accounting systems and chaotic procedures in some departments, many shortcomings in the bank's work were also exposed, such as cumbersome procedures, slow processing, short overtime hours, and poor attitudes of individual cadres. These issues have attracted serious attention from the banks, and they are currently discussing ways to overcome and improve them.

    认真实行现金管理  银行存款显著增加
    【本报讯】察省张垣、宣化、大同、张北等地人民银行严格实行现金管理，存款显著增加。该省金融会议结束后，各该市、县均分别召开了党、政、军、企业、合作社等部门的联席会议或座谈会，讨论如何贯彻政务院与人民银行总行关于现金管理命令。分行并派出主要干部协助进行。四月十八日张市营业部召开会议时计有省市机关、企业、部队、合作社共三十多个单位参加。宣化、大同、张北亦于十六、十七两日先后召开会议，并有县长或财政科长参加。各单位都一致表示忠诚拥护中央命令，坚决遵守现金管理。由于机关、部队、企业、合作社认真的遵守现金管理，故察省人民银行存款数字显著增加。张市四月中旬存款总额为上旬存入的百分之一百三十四，四月二十四日存款余额为二日存款余额的百分之二百四十八；大同四月二十四日存款余额为二日存款余额的百分之一百五十八；张北四月二十四日存款余额为四月二日存款余额的百分之一百八十；宣化四月二十四日存款余额为四月二日存款余额的百分之一百一十三。
    四月二十日起，张垣、宣化、大同、张北等县市已先后进入检查阶段，各地根据具体情况，组织了一个到六个小组，深入各部门进行检查。对个别部门并进行必要的说服和动员，使现款存入国家银行。经过检查的一百二十多个单位，没有一个拒绝检查的，且现金一般均能按时入库。账据库存也都公开。有的单位会计不熟练，检查人员还细心进行帮助。
    当然检查中，除发现了有些部门的会计制度不健全、手续紊乱外，并暴露了银行工作上的许多缺点，如手续烦琐，办事慢，加班时间还短，个别干部态度不好等。这些均已引起各银行严重注意，现在分别讨论克服和改进中。
