　　Resolutely Oppose Hedonistic Corruption!
    ——Reactions to "Gao Shiyi's Self-Reflection on Hedonistic and Corrupt Thoughts"
     (I) To the Editor:
    After the news about "Gao Shiyi's Self-Reflection on Hedonistic and Corrupt Thoughts" was published on page three of your newspaper on April 20th, we believe that Comrade Gao Shiyi's corrupt behavior is a concrete manifestation of his residual landlord class ideology after entering the city, which is worthy of serious vigilance. We believe that the opinion of the Xi'an Mass Daily editorial, "We communists should not take the individual as the standard for the enjoyment of material life, but should take the class as the standard," is correct. Comrade Gao Shiyi forgot that "If we are preoccupied with material life and infected with the germs of hedonism, we will lose the most precious qualities of a communist: a spirit of progress, a sense of responsibility, and a spirit of creation." Comrade Gao Shiyi has contributed to the people and to the revolution, which is glorious, but it is also what he should do, especially for a communist, it is his duty. Comrade Gao Gang raised this question in his article "To Whom Does the Honor Belong?" He said not to act like a veteran (this is a burden), and not to think of oneself as remarkable; past honors do not equal present honors, and if one does dishonorable things now, then past honors will be completely lost.
    In addition, we have a point that we do not understand, that is, what is Comrade Gao Shiyi's treatment after returning to Xi'an, is it a salary system or a supply system? If it is a supply system, then where does the money for the small mansion, two pairs of binoculars, two cameras, five Parker pens, and a motorcycle come from? Needless to say, it is impossible to buy these things under the supply system (even with health care fees and subsidies), and even under the current salary system, it is impossible to afford them. The source of the money is not clearly explained in the news, which we are not satisfied with, and we hope to get an answer and be published in the newspaper.

    (II) To the Editor:
    After reading the report "Gao Shiyi's Self-Reflection on Hedonistic and Corrupt Thoughts" published on page three of your newspaper on April 20th, I feel that Gao Shiyi's mistake is mainly due to his ideological and work style errors, but on the other hand, I think that our People's Government has not yet established a strict personnel and salary system, which objectively condoned the development of this hedonistic style.
    If the government had a fixed establishment, and every staff member had his fixed job position and authority, then he would not have been so easy to "take over" gardeners and cooks, so that "five people served one person." Secondly, because there is no strict fixed quota system for the salaries and benefits of senior cadres, and spending money can be arbitrary, it is possible for him to have wasteful behaviors such as "buying five Parker pens, buying two cameras, two pairs of binoculars, a motorcycle, and sea cucumbers and other things." If he had a certain supply or salary, even if he wanted to buy these things, he would not be able to afford them all at once. Although, "cannot afford to buy" does not prove that he has no hedonistic thoughts, but at least objectively the people's property will reduce some unnecessary losses. At the same time, the limitations of objective conditions can also play a certain restrictive role in the occurrence of his hedonistic thoughts.
    Therefore, I believe that if our people's governments at all levels can establish a strict personnel and salary system in a timely manner, combined with criticism and self-criticism, it can effectively guarantee that our cadres will not be corrupted. Otherwise, just having ideological and work style reflection is not enough. Sincerely,
    Ren Jiyu, Peking University
    Editor's Note: Northwest government staff work under a supply system; the large amount of money wasted by Comrade Gao Shiyi was indeed public funds that were used by taking advantage of his position and without following the system. Originally, the People's Government has clear regulations on the treatment of cadres at all levels (including clothing, food, housing, transportation, and employment), and the vast majority of our cadres consciously abide by this regulation, and the vast majority of agencies act in accordance with this regulation. But there are indeed individual agencies and individual cadres who violate this regulation, especially after entering the city, due to the attack of corrupt and hedonistic ideas on individual comrades, the phenomenon of waste and corruption of these comrades has become serious. The huge waste error committed by Comrade Gao Shiyi and the error of the agency not strictly implementing the system is a more serious example. The opinions put forward by Comrade Ren Jiyu of Peking University are correct, and it is hoped that the financial departments at all levels will pay attention.

### 坚决反对享乐腐化！——《高士一反省享乐腐化思想》的反响

　　坚决反对享乐腐化！
    ——《高士一反省享乐腐化思想》的反响
     （一）编辑同志：
    四月二十日贵报第三版发表的关于《高士一反省享乐腐化思想》的消息后，我们认为高士一同志的腐化行为是他的地主阶级残余思想在进城后的具体表现，这是值得大家严重警惕的。我们认为西安群众日报社论所说的，“我们共产党人对于物质生活的享受，不应该以个人作标准，应该以阶级作标准”的意见，是正确的。高士一同志忘记了：“若果我们斤斤计较物质生活，染上享乐主义的病菌，那就会失掉共产党人最可宝贵的品质——前进心，责任心，创造心。”高士一同志对人民有过功，对革命有过贡献，是光荣的，但也是应该的，特别对共产党人来说，这是他的天职。高岗同志在《荣誉是属于谁的》这篇文章里，就提出这一个问题，他说不要摆老资格（这是包袱），不要以为自己了不起；过去的荣誉，并不等于现在的荣誉，现在做出不荣誉的事情，那么，过去的荣誉，也会完全丧失的。
    另外，我们还有一点不明白的地方，就是高士一同志返西安后的待遇，是薪金制还是供给制？假如是供给制的话，那末小公馆的花费，两只望远镜，两架照像机，五支派克钢笔，一辆摩托车，是那儿来的钱呢？买这些东西，不必说是供给制（即使有保健费及津贴），就是按现在薪金制的标准也是买不起的。钱的来源，消息中没有交代明白，我们是不满意的，希望能作答复，在报刊上公开发表。
    四个读者上  一九五○年四月二十七日
    （二）编辑同志：
    读了四月二十日贵报第三版刊载的《高士一反省享乐腐化思想》一篇报道，我感到高士一的错误，固然主要是由于他的思想作风的错误，但在另一方面，我以为我们的人民政府还没有建立起严格的人事及薪给的制度，在客观上也纵容了这种享乐作风的发展。
    假如政府有定额的编制，每一个工作人员都有他固定的工作岗位和职权，那末他就不会那样容易地“接收”花匠和伙夫，使“五个人侍候他一个人”了。其次，由于在高级干部的薪给待遇方面没有严格的定额的制度，花钱可以随便，所以才使他可能有“买五支派克钢笔，买照像机两个，望远镜两架，摩托车一辆，还有海参等其他东西”等浪费的行为。如果他有一定的供给或薪给，即使他想买这些东西，一时也买不起，买不全。虽然，“买不起”，并不就是证明他没有享乐思想，但是至少在客观上人民的财产会减少一些不必要的损失。同时，客观条件的限制，也是可以对他的享乐思想的发生起着一定的限制作用的。
    因此，我以为如果我们的各级人民政府能及时建立一套严格的人事及薪给制度，再结合批评与自我批评，才可以切实有效地保证我们的干部不腐化。否则，光有思想作风的反省，仍是不够的。  此致敬礼
    北京大学任继愈
    编者按：西北政府工作人员是实行供给制的；高士一同志所浪费的大量金钱，的确是利用职权、不按制度、随便支用的公款。本来，人民政府对于各级干部的待遇（包括衣、食、住、行、用人）早就有明确的规定，我们绝大多数的干部自觉地遵守这个规定，绝大多数机关按照这个规定办事。但的确也有个别机关和个别干部违反这个规定，特别是在进城以后，由于个别同志受了腐朽的享乐思想的袭击，这些同志的浪费腐化的现象就严重起来。高士一同志所犯的巨大浪费的错误和该机关没有严格执行制度的错误，就是一个比较严重的例子。北京大学任继愈同志提出的意见是正确的，希望各级财政部门注意。
