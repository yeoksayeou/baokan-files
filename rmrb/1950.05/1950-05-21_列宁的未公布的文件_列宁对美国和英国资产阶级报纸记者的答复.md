　　Lenin's Unpublished Documents
    Lenin's Replies to American and British Bourgeois Newspaper Reporters

The following are Lenin's replies to questions from reporters of American and British bourgeois newspapers, written in February 1920, during a period of temporary respite after the defeat of Kolchak and Denikin.

In his replies concerning the international situation and the foreign policy of the Soviet state, Lenin proceeded from the possibility of peaceful coexistence between the Soviet state and capitalist countries. Lenin emphasized Soviet Russia's unwavering desire for peace and pointed out that the obstacle to this peace was "imperialism on the part of American (and any other) capitalists."

The published documents are of great significance in exposing the imperialists, especially the American imperialists, who are warmongers and opponents of peace.

The second document addresses the tasks of peaceful economic construction and contains Lenin's complete formula regarding the significance of electrification in Russia for communist construction: "Electrification on the basis of the Soviet system will create the ultimate victory of the communist foundation of our country, the ultimate victory of a cultural life without exploiters, without capitalists, without landlords, without merchants."

              Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute attached to the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)

    I. Replies to questions from a reporter of the American newspaper *New York Evening Post*

    1. "Are we prepared to attack Poland and Romania?"

    No. We declare our desire for peace in the most solemn and formal manner and in the name of the Council of People's Commissars and the All-Russian Central Executive Committee. Unfortunately, the government of French capitalists is instigating Poland to attack us (and probably Romania as well). Several American radiograms from Lyon even mention this.

    2. "What are our plans in Asia?"

    The same as in Europe: peaceful coexistence with the peoples of all countries, with the workers and peasants of all nations who yearn for a new life, a life without exploitation, without landlords, without capitalists, without merchants. The imperialist war of 1914-1918, the war of the British-French (and Russian) capitalist groups against the German-Austrian capitalist groups for the division of the world, has awakened Asia and strengthened the desire for freedom, for peaceful labor, and for the cessation of war there and elsewhere.

    3. "What is the basis for peace with the United States?"

    Let the American capitalists not encroach upon us. We do not encroach upon them. We are even prepared to buy machines, tools, etc. useful for transportation and production from them with gold. And not only with gold, but also with raw materials.

    4. "What are the obstacles to this peace?"

    There are no obstacles on our part. The obstacle is imperialism on the part of American (and any other) capitalists.

    5. "What is our view on the expulsion of Russian revolutionaries by the United States?"

    We would receive them. We are not afraid of revolutionaries here. We are generally not afraid of anyone, and if the United States is still afraid of some hundreds or thousands of its own citizens, we are prepared to begin negotiations to receive all the citizens feared by the United States (excluding criminals, of course).

    6. "Is an economic alliance between Russia and Germany possible?"

    Unfortunately, it is not very likely. Because the likes of Scheidemann are not good allies. We establish alliances with all countries, excluding none.

    7. "What is our view on the Allied demand for the surrender of war criminals?"

    Seriously speaking, the capitalists of all countries are war criminals in this regard. Surrender all landlords (owning more than one hundred hectares of land) and capitalists (owning more than one hundred thousand francs of capital) to us, -- we will educate them to engage in useful labor, we will make them stop playing the shameful, ugly, bloody role of exploiters and war criminals who divide colonies. Then war will soon become absolutely impossible.

    8. "What is the impact of peace with us on the economic situation in Europe?"

    Is it not beneficial for Europe to exchange machines for grain, flax, and other raw materials? Obviously, it cannot be otherwise.

    9. "What is our view on the future development of the Soviets as a world power?"

    The future belongs to the Soviet system throughout the world. This is evidenced by the facts: it is enough to calculate the growth in the number of pamphlets, books, leaflets, and newspapers supporting and sympathizing with the Soviets in any country, for example, in just three months. It cannot be otherwise: when the workers in the cities, the workers in the countryside, the hired laborers, the day laborers, and the small peasants, that is, the peasants who do not rely on exploiting hired labor, when this vast majority of the working people once understand that the Soviets will hand over all power to them and at the same time liberate them from the shackles of landlords and capitalists, then how can the victory of the Soviet system in the world be prevented? At least, I do not know of such means.

    10. "Should Russia still fear foreign counter-revolutionary intervention?"

    Unfortunately, yes. Because capitalists are foolish and greedy people. They have made many such foolish and greedy attempts at intervention, so we should fear repetition, until the workers and peasants of each country have transformed their capitalists.

    11. "Is Russia prepared to have business dealings with the United States?"

    Of course, like with all countries. The peace treaty with Estonia (to which we made great concessions) proves that we are prepared for this purpose, under certain conditions, even to lease enterprises.

                          B. Ulyanov (N. Lenin)
                        February 18, 1920
                                     Printed according to the original manuscript

    This article was published in English in the February 21, 1920 issue No. 12671 of the *New York Evening Post*.

    This is the first time it has been published in Russian.

    II. Replies to questions from a reporter of the British newspaper *Daily Express*

    (1) "What is our attitude towards the lifting of the blockade?"

    We believe this is a big step forward. It opens up for us the possibility of transitioning from the war that we were forced into by the capitalist governments of the Entente to peaceful construction. And this is the most important thing for us. We are using all our strength to restore the national economic life, because the country was initially destroyed by the capitalists' wars for the Dardanelles, for the division of colonies, and later by the wars of the Entente and Russian capitalists against the Russian workers; we are now drafting a plan for the electrification of all of Russia with the help of some scholars and technical experts. This plan is prepared to be implemented over many years. Electrification will transform the face of Russia. Electrification on the basis of the Soviet system will create the ultimate victory of the communist foundation of our country, the ultimate victory of a cultural life without exploiters, without capitalists, without landlords, without merchants.

    Lifting the blockade will definitely help the realization of the electrification plan.

    (2) "What impact will the Allies' decision to cease offensive actions have on attacks on the Soviet regime?"

    We were attacked by the Allies and their allies and lackeys: Kolchak, Denikin, the capitalists of the countries around us. We have not attacked anyone. We concluded a peace treaty with Estonia, even enduring material sacrifices.

    We eagerly await the Allies to confirm their "decision" with their actions. Unfortunately, the history of the Treaty of Versailles and its consequences show that: among the Allies, words are often inconsistent with actions, and decisions remain on paper.

    (3) "Do we think the current situation is satisfactory for Soviet policy?"

    Yes, because any status quo in policy transitions from the old to the new. The current status quo, in many ways, is a transition from war to peace. This transition is exactly what we desire. Therefore, and only therefore, do we consider the status quo satisfactory.

    (4) "Since the Allies have ceased military actions, what is our goal?"

    Our goal, as mentioned above, is peaceful economic construction. A detailed plan for peaceful economic construction based on electrification is now being drafted by a committee (or rather: several committees) of scholars and technical experts, in accordance with the resolution of the February (1920) meeting of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee.

### 列宁的未公布的文件  列宁对美国和英国资产阶级报纸记者的答复

专栏：

　　列宁的未公布的文件
    列宁对美国和英国资产阶级报纸记者的答复
    以下公布的是列宁对美国和英国资产阶级报纸记者的答复，写于一九二○年二月，在粉碎了高尔察克和但尼金以后的暂时休息的时期。
    列宁在关于国际形势和苏维埃国家对外政策的答复中，是从苏维埃国家与资本主义国家有和平并存的可能性出发的。列宁强调苏俄对和平的不变的渴望，并指出这种和平的障碍是“美国的（以及任何其他的）资本家方面的帝国主义”。
    公布的文件对于揭穿帝国主义者，特别是揭穿战争挑拨者与和平反对者的美国帝国主义者具有非常重大的意义。
    在第二个文件内说到和平经济建设的任务并包含着列宁关于俄国电气化对于共产主义建设的意义的完整的公式：“在苏维埃制度基础上的电气化，将造成我国共产主义基础的最终胜利，将造成没有剥削者、没有资本家、没有地主、没有商人的文化生活基础的最终胜利。”
              联共（布）中央附设马克思——恩格斯——列宁学院
    一  对美国报纸《纽约晚报》记者的问题的答复
    １、“我们是否准备进攻波兰和罗马尼亚？”
    不。我们用最郑重和正式的方式并以人民委员会和全俄中央执行委员会的名义宣布我们的和平的意愿。可惜法国资本家的政府挑动波兰进攻我们（大概还挑动罗马尼亚）。关于这点甚至有好些从里昂发出的美国无线电报也都说到了。
    ２、“我们在亚洲的计划是什么？”
    像在欧洲的一样：同各国人民，同一切民族的渴求新的生活，渴求没有剥削、没有地主、没有资本家、没有商人的生活的工人和农民和平共居。一九一四——一九一八年的帝国主义战争，英国——法国的（以及俄国的）资本家集团为了瓜分世界而反对德国——奥国的资本家集团的战争，唤醒了亚洲，加强了那里以及其他各处对自由、对和平劳动、对制止战争的渴望。
    ３、“同美国和平的基础是什么？”
    让美国资本家不要触犯我们。我们是不触犯他们的。我们甚至准备用黄金向他们购买对运输和生产有用的机器、工具等等。并且不只用黄金，而且还用原料。
    ４、“这种和平的障碍是什么？”
    我们这方面是任何障碍也没有的。障碍是美国的（以及任何其他的）资本家方面的帝国主义。
    ５、“我们对于美国逐出俄国革命者的看法如何？”
    我们收容他们。我们这里不害怕革命者。我们一般是不害怕任何人的，如果美国还害怕什么几百或几千自己的公民的话，我们就准备开始谈判由我们来收容所有一切为美国所惧怕的公民（当然，刑事犯除外）。
    ６、“俄国和德国的经济同盟有可能吗？”
    可惜是可能性不大。因为谢德曼之流是不好的同盟者。我们同一切国家建立同盟，谁都不除外。
    ７、“我们对于同盟国要求交出战争罪犯的看法如何？”
    关于这一点如果认真说起来，那末一切国家的资本家都是战争罪犯。把一切（拥有一百公顷以上土地的）地主和（拥有十万以上法郎资本的）资本家交给我们，——我们将教育他们从事有益的劳动，我们将使他们终止扮演剥削者和瓜分殖民地的战争罪犯这些可耻的、丑恶的、血腥的脚色。那末战争将很快地成为绝对不可能的了。
    ８、“同我们的和平对于欧洲经济状况的影响如何？”
    用机器交换粮食、亚麻和其他原料——这难道对于欧洲不是有益的吗？显然不能不是有益的。
    ９、“我们对于苏维埃作为世界力量的将来发展的看法如何？”
    将来是属于全世界的苏维埃制度。这是有事实为证的：只须计算一下，比方就拿三个月来说吧，任何国家的拥护苏维埃和同情苏维埃的小册子、书籍、传单、报纸数目的增长，也就够了。不能有另外的情形：当城市里的工人、乡村里的工人、长工、短工、以及小农、即不依靠剥削雇工的农民，当这极大多数的劳动人民一旦懂得了苏维埃会将全部政权交给他们手中，同时把他们从地主和资本家的羁绊下解放出来，那末怎么能够阻止苏维埃制度在全世界上的胜利呢？至少我是不知道有这种手段的。
    １０、“俄国是否还应当害怕外来的反革命的干涉呢？”
    可惜，还应当。因为资本家是一些愚蠢而又贪婪的人。他们作过了好些这样愚蠢而又贪婪的干涉尝试，所以我们应该害怕重复，一直到每个国家的工人和农民改造了自己的资本家。
    １１、“俄国是否准备同美国发生事务的交往？”
    当然是准备的，像同一切国家一样。对爱沙尼亚（我们对他们作了很大的让步）的和约证明了我们准备为此目的，在某种条件下，甚至可以租让企业。

                                     按原稿排印
    此文用英文刊登于一九二○年二月二十一日《纽约晚报》第一二六七一期。
    用俄文刊布这是第一次。
    二  对英国报纸《每日快报》记者的问题的答复
    （１）“我们对于解除封锁的态度如何？”
    我们以为这是前进了一大步。这为我们打开了从协约国资本家政府所强迫我们进行的战争过渡到和平建设的可能。而这对于我们是最主要的。我们正运用全部力量来恢复国家经济生活，因为国家最初曾被资本家为争夺达达尼尔，为争夺殖民地的战争所破坏，后来又被协约国和俄国的资本家为反对俄国工人的战争所破坏；我们现在正在一些学者和技术专家帮助之下拟订全俄电气化的计划。这个计划准备在许多年内实现。电气化将使俄国面目一新。在苏维埃制度基础上的电气化，将造成我国共产主义基础的最终胜利，将造成没有剥削者、没有资本家、没有地主、没有商人的文化生活基础的最终胜利。
    解除封锁一定会帮助电气化计划的实现。
    （２）“同盟国的停止进攻的决定对于苏维埃政权的攻击行动的影响如何？”
    攻击我们的是协约国及其同盟者和走狗：高尔察克，但尼金，我们周围的国家的资本家。我们没有攻击过任何人。我们同爱沙尼亚缔结了和约，甚至忍受了物质的牺牲。
    我们急切地期待着同盟国的“决定”用他们的行动来证实。可惜凡尔赛和约的历史及其后果表明了：在同盟国那里，说话大多是与行动不符的，决定仍然停留在纸上。
    （３）“我们是否认为目前的现状是苏维埃政策所满意的？”
    是的，因为政策中的任何现状都是由旧的过渡到新的。当前的现状就许多方面讲来是由战争过渡到和平。这种过渡正是我们所愿望的。因此，而且仅仅因此，我们认为现状是满意的。
    （４）“既然同盟国方面停止了军事行动，我们的目的是什么？”
    我们的目的，如上所说，是和平经济建设。以电气化为基础的详细的和平经济建设计划，按照全俄中央执行委员会二月（一九二○年）会议的决议，现在正由学者和技术专家的委员会（正确些说：几个委员会）拟订中。
                    按原稿排印
    写于一九二○年二月十八日。
    用英文刊登于一九二○年二月二十三日《每日快报》第六一九八期。
    用俄文刊布这是第一次。
