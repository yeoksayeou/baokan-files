　　Fengzhen Station Worker E Shoucheng Catches a Special Agent
    On May 9th, as the 222nd freight train at Fengzhen Station was about to depart, switchman Comrade E Shoucheng saw a person drop something thirty meters away from the switch and then turn to leave. E Shoucheng, seeing the person's suspicious behavior, told him to stop and immediately ran over to check. He found a detonator placed on the railroad tracks. He immediately apprehended him and handed him over to the station's public security officer, who took him back to the public security sub-bureau. Comrade E Shoucheng's spirit of meticulous and responsible work is worthy of our learning.

　　丰镇车站工友鄂守成捉特务
    五月九日丰镇站第二二二次货物列车正要离站的时候，转辙员鄂守成同志在道岔子外三十公尺处看见一个人放下一块东西，回头就走了。鄂守成看那人形迹可疑，就叫他站住，并且立即跑过去检查，结果发现在铁道上面放着一个雷管。他当时就把他捕获交给该站公安员带回公安分所去。鄂守成同志这种工作细心负责的精神，是值得我们学习的。
