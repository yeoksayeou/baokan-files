World Peace Movement Month
(April 9th to May 6th)
	Signature Campaign
The World Peace Congress Standing Committee's appeal to "Ban atomic weapons; and declare the government that first uses this weapon a war criminal" has received a broad response from the people of all countries, and the signature campaign is being enthusiastically carried out around the world. Democratic organizations such as the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the International Union of Students, and the Women's International Democratic Federation have unanimously supported the signature campaign. Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg also published an open letter urging Western writers to respond to the signature campaign and "stop the guns from speaking." The signature campaign in Eastern European People's Democratic countries is progressing very rapidly. According to statistics at the end of April, the number of signatories: Bulgaria has reached more than 5.4 million; Hungary has reached more than 6.8 million; and Romania has reached more than 6.64 million.
	In European capitalist countries, the signature campaign is also booming. In France, almost all workers in many factories and mines in places such as Bissau, Levalois, and Aucher have signed. People in various parts of the UK have pre-ordered 250,000 forms for 5 million signatures from the British Peace Committee. Sixteen major cities in Italy have held votes supporting the recommendations of the appeal. The signature campaign in West Germany began on April 9th, and more than 100,000 people had signed within a week. By mid-April, 300,000 people in Finland had signed. Participants in the Finnish peace relay race are simultaneously collecting signatures along the 20,000-kilometer route. On April 19th, under the strong pressure of the people's demand for peace, the Finnish Prime Minister and twelve ministers had no choice but to sign the appeal. Thousands of people in Chicago, Boston, Calais and other places in the United States have signed. In China, the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace has also issued a notice calling on people across the country to launch a signature campaign.
	Anti-"Military Aid" Struggle
The working people of Western Europe strongly protested against the shipment of American "aid" munitions to Europe. When American ships carrying munitions arrived in Antwerp, Belgium, they could not unload due to protests from workers in the port and had to be transferred elsewhere. When four of them arrived in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, they encountered similar protests from Dutch workers and could not be unloaded. Naples, Italy, held a general strike on April 12th to protest against US imperialism unloading munitions at the port's military docks at night. On the 12th and 13th, demonstrations and protests were held successively throughout Italy. When American ships carrying munitions arrived in Cherbourg, France, a large number of military police cut off traffic to the docks in an attempt to stop the demonstrating masses. However, the French people still held demonstrations. The strike by dockworkers in Marseille to refuse to load and unload munitions has entered its second month and they have resolved to continue to persist.
	"May Day" Labor Day
This year's "May Day" International Labor Day is a day for the working people of the world to unite and stage a general demonstration against the war bloc. Grand review ceremonies were held in the capitals of the Soviet Union and various People's Democratic countries.
	The working people of capitalist countries celebrated "May Day" under the slogan of opposing war and defending peace. Grand rallies and parades were held throughout Italy, with the participation of 10 million people. Forty-four democratic groups in France held a large demonstration in Paris. In addition, 600,000 people in Tokyo's Imperial Palace Square, 80,000 workers in Jakarta's Freedom Square in Indonesia, and 75,000 people in New York's Union Square simultaneously issued solemn calls to resolutely fight for peace. People in India and the Philippines also held rallies separately under the strict guard of the authorities.
