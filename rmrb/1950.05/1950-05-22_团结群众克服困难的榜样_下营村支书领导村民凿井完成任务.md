A Model of Unity and Overcoming Difficulties
The Party Secretary of Xiaying Village Leads Villagers to Dig a Well and Complete the Task

　　In Xiaying Village, Changxindian, sloping land accounts for about 40% of the more than 2,000 mu of land. The more than 200 mu of land in the Fox Ditch at the foot of the northern slope of the village is cultivated by more than 40 poor peasant households. It is very difficult to get water for planting sweet potatoes and peanuts on the slopes. Planting other crops yields very little. People have always hoped to dig a well, but they lacked the economic strength and organizational leadership. Comrade Cui Dequan, the Party Branch Secretary of the village, took on this leadership responsibility. He believed that digging a well would not only guarantee the successful planting of sweet potatoes and peanuts, but also allow for the planting of cotton with slight soil improvement. Comrade Cui Dequan, together with Guo Baoquan and Cui Deyou from the village, began preparations and consulted Li Wanquan, an experienced well digger, to make a well-digging plan. When Comrade Cui called on the people who cultivated land in Fox Ditch to invest shares, there were still many concerns and doubts among the masses. A few people in the village ridiculed him. Some said, "The government is promoting loans, but it may not be implemented. What will they use to do it!" Some said, "A well was dug not far from that place before, but no water came out. Isn't this just a waste of effort!" Others said, "The soil underneath that place is all loose soil. If water is dug out, the earthen well will collapse."
　　Comrade Cui Dequan and others borrowed 600 jin of rice from the government, prepared well-digging tools, and started work on April 13th. On the second day of construction, two more people were added: one was Cui Dequan's son, and the other was a member of the Communist Youth League. While working according to the plan, they continued to publicize to the masses. When they dug to three zhang, the number of people voluntarily joining the work increased to eleven, forming a well-digging team. The planned depth was six zhang, but when they dug to five zhang, the well soil was still dry. At this time, the people participating in the well digging wavered again. At the same time, others said, "Nothing will come of it." Chen Jincai, who was sixty-three years old, said, "Don't think that he (referring to Cui) is a Communist Party member and can do anything, but he can't dig water out of this well." At this time, among the eleven people in the well-digging team, not only did the latecomers lose their energy, but even the two who originally partnered up panicked. Cui Deyou said, "Now that everyone is working, why don't we take a few days off to do something else! If we don't rest, and no water comes out, won't it delay production?" Comrade Cui Dequan consulted Li Wanquan every day, and calmly used persuasive methods to encourage everyone to persevere to the end, while also closely grasping the three members of the League in the group. After persisting for two days, and digging another three chi, there was stone underneath, and everyone's morale was even lower. Comrade Cui encouraged everyone and said, "If the stone can't be removed with a pickaxe, we will borrow explosives to blast it." As a result, after digging nine chi under the stone, they saw a spring. League member Han Weiqin bled profusely when he was smashing the stone, but he didn't rest and finally successfully completed the task, with a water output of more than three zhang. According to their original plan of "water coming out at a depth of six zhang, with sixty workdays to complete the task," they only exceeded a dozen workdays.
　　Even during the most severe drought, the well has a water depth of seven chi. Without the well, people carried water to plant sweet potatoes, each person carrying only eighteen loads a day, but now they can carry fifty loads. The well can now supply water to 150 to 200 mu of land. Calculating that each mu saves two workdays, just the water carrying alone can save three to four hundred workdays. The increased yield after irrigation is not even counted. It is also possible to plant cotton.
　　From then on, not only did the people who cultivated land in Fox Ditch admire the model Communist Party member Comrade Cui Dequan, but all the villagers also unanimously praised his working spirit of patiently overcoming difficulties, uniting and leading the masses, and persevering to the end, which greatly improved the prestige of the branch among the masses.

### 团结群众克服困难的榜样  下营村支书领导村民凿井完成任务

　　团结群众克服困难的榜样
    下营村支书领导村民凿井完成任务
    长辛店下营村两千多亩土地中，坡地约占十分之四。耕种村北坡根狐狸沟的二百多亩土地的，是四十几户贫农。在坡地种白薯、花生，用水非常困难。种其他作物，产量很小。人们一直盼望打一眼井，但是缺乏经济力量和组织领导的人。该村党的支部书记崔德泉同志就担负起这个领导责任。他认为打一眼井，不但可以保证把白薯和花生种好，稍微改良土壤，还能种棉花。崔德泉同志联合本村郭保全、崔德有二人开始筹备，并请教打井老手李万全，作出了打井计划。崔同志号召狐狸沟种地的人入股时，群众中还存在着许多顾虑和怀疑。村里有少数人讥笑他。有的说：“政府宣传贷款，不一定能实行，他们用啥干哪！”有的说：“离那地方不远曾打过井，就没出水，这次还不是白费劲！”又有的说：“那地方底下都是松土，打出水来，土井也得塌。”
    崔德泉同志等从政府借到了六百斤米，准备了打井的工具，四月十三日就开工了。开工的第二天，就增加了两个人：一个是崔德泉的儿子，一个是青年团员。他们按照计划一面工作，一面不断向群众宣传。挖到三丈时，自愿加入干活的增到十一人，组成了打井组。预定计划打六丈深，可是挖到五丈时，井土仍然是干的。这时候参加挖井的人又动摇了。同时别人也说：“干不出个长短来。”六十三岁的陈进财说：“别看他（指崔）是共产党员，什么都可以干，就是这个井他打不出水来。”这时在打井组的十一人中，不但后来参加的干得没劲了，连最初合伙的二人也发了慌。崔德有说：“现在人家都干活，咱们不如歇几天干点别的吧！若不歇，打不出水来，不耽误生产吗？”崔德泉同志每日一面请教李万全，一面沉着地用说服方法，鼓励大家坚持到底，同时抓紧组内三个团员。这样坚持了两天，再挖下三尺，底下就是石头，大家情绪更加低落。崔同志鼓励大家说：“这石头若是用镐弄不掉，咱们就借炸药崩掉他。”结果在石头底下挖下九尺，就看见了泉眼。团员韩维勤在捣石头时，砸得头破血流，也不休息，终于胜利完成了任务，出水量达三丈以上。按照他们原来的“六丈深出水，六十个工完成任务”的计划，仅超过十几个工。
    该井在天旱最严重的时候，也有七尺深的水量。没井时，该地担水种白薯，每人一日只担十八挑，现在则可担五十挑。现该井能供给一百五十亩到二百亩的用水。按每亩省两个工计算，仅担水一项就可省三四百个工。浇地后增加的产量还不算。还可能种棉花。
    从此以后，不仅在狐狸沟种地的人都佩服模范共产党员崔德泉同志。全村农民也一致赞扬他这种耐心克服困难，团结领导群众，坚持到底的工作精神，使支部威信在群众中大大提高。
