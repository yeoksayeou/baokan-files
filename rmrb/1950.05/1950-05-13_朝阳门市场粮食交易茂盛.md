　　Flourishing Grain Trade at Chaoyangmen Market

　　[Our Dispatch] Since its establishment on March 24th, the Chaoyangmen grain market has become increasingly prosperous, with daily grain transactions reaching around 100,000 jin. The majority of buyers are fellow villagers and rural merchants from the eight counties of eastern Hebei. They transport firewood, pigs, pears, etc., in exchange for Northeast grain and food rations. The grain available on the market each day is quickly sold out. In order to facilitate transactions for the villagers, the market does not require any procedures or charge any fees. As long as both buyers and sellers engage in fair trade, there are no restrictions on entry qualifications.

　　朝阳门市场粮食交易茂盛
    【本报讯】朝阳门粮食市场自三月二十四日建立以来，日趋繁荣，每日成交粮食达十万斤左右。买户大部是冀东八县的老乡和乡贩。他们运来木柴、猪、梨等，换回东北粮及口粮。每天上市的食粮都能很快售完。该市场为了照顾乡民交易方便，没有任何手续，不收任何费用，买卖双方只要实行公平交易，对入场资格不加限制。
