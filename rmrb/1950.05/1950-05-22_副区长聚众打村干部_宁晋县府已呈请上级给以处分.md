Deputy District Head Gathers a Crowd to Beat Village Cadres;
Ningjin County Government Has Submitted a Request to Higher Authorities for Punishment

Zhou HaiShui (Communist Party member), Deputy District Head of the Fifth District of Ningjin County, Xingtai Prefecture, Hebei Province, is from Tangjiazhai Village in the Eighth District of the county. Since he stopped working in production and joined the work force in 1948, he has consistently been irresponsible in his work and has had an extremely improper style. In July of last year, when he was the District Head of the Seventh District, he was criticized in a county-wide circular for errors such as being passive and lazy in his work and engaging in affairs with women. Later, he was transferred to the Fifth District as Deputy District Head, but his bad habits did not change. On the third day of the first lunar month this year, when he returned home, he gathered a group to beat Tang Xiaolu, a village cadre from Tangjiazhai Village, in order to avenge a personal grudge.

Tang Xiaolu has been working in the village since the Anti-Japanese War and has been very active in mass movements. Before 1948, Zhou HaiShui and Tang Xiaolu both served as militia captains in the village. At that time, Zhou HaiShui embezzled a homemade gun and was discovered by Tang Xiaolu. From then on, Zhou HaiShui held a grudge against Tang Xiaolu and remembered this personal feud. In addition, during his time in office, Zhou HaiShui often had the village government send seven or eight people to work for him. However, according to the situation in the village, Zhou HaiShui's family should not have had people cultivate his land for him. Therefore, Tang Xiaolu advocated not having people cultivate his land for him. As a result, Zhou HaiShui hated Tang Xiaolu even more. Kong Junlu, the Propaganda Committee member of the District Committee, also had some opinions about Tang Xiaolu. On the third day of the first lunar month this year, Zhou and Kong happened to return home at the same time and secretly held a meeting to plan the struggle against Tang Xiaolu. On the morning of the fourth day, they held a meeting in the village to struggle against Tang Xiaolu. Under the control of Zhou HaiShui, Tang Xiaowa, Du Genyou, Tang Jincai (former rich peasant), Heiwa (deserter) and others rushed forward, punching and kicking Tang Xiaolu until he fainted. At this time, Lan Qing, the Organization Committee member of the village branch, stepped forward to dissuade them, but was also beaten by Du Genyou and others. Zhou HaiShui kept shouting for them to continue beating him, and as a result, Tang Xiaolu was beaten until he was covered in bruises and could not move.

After this incident occurred, the county government immediately sent people to the village to investigate. After clarifying the situation, the county government immediately requested the prefecture to remove Zhou HaiShui from his post and hand him over to the court for legal processing. At the same time, the county party committee decided to request the prefectural committee to approve the expulsion of Zhou HaiShui from the party. Other accomplices will also be given due punishment.

　　副区长聚众打村干部
    宁晋县府已呈请上级给以处分
    河北邢台专区宁晋县五区副区长周海水（共产党员）是本县八区汤家寨人。自一九四八年脱离生产参加工作后，他对工作一贯不负责任，作风极不正派。去年七月在七区任区长时，曾因消极怠工搞女人等错误，受到该县通报批评。后调五区任副区长，坏作风仍未转变。在今年阴历正月初三日回家时，为了报复私仇，竟聚伙殴打汤家寨村干部汤小路。
    汤小路，自抗日时期到现在，一直在村里工作，在群众运动中表现很积极。一九四八年以前，周海水和汤小路同在本村任自卫队长。那时周海水曾贪污了一支土枪，被汤小路查出来。从此周海水对汤小路即怀恨在心，记下了私仇。此外，周海水在工作时期，经常由村政府派七八个人给他做活，但按该村情况来说，周海水家是不应叫人代耕的，因此汤小路主张不给他代耕。于是周海水更恨汤小路。区委宣传委员孔俊禄亦对汤小路有些意见。今年正月初三，周孔二人恰巧同时回家，暗中召开了布置斗争汤小路的会议。初四上午即在村中召开斗争汤小路大会，在周海水支配之下，汤小哇、杜根有、汤进才（旧富农）、黑娃（逃亡战士）等人一涌而上，拳打脚踢，把汤小路打得昏了过去。这时村支部组织委员兰庆上前解劝，也被杜根有等人打了一顿。周海水还不住的叫打，结果把汤小路打得满身青肿，不能行动。
    此事件发生后，县政府马上派人到该村调查。调查清楚之后，县政府即呈请专署将周海水撤职，并交法院依法处理。同时县委决定呈请地委批准开除周海水党籍。对其他协同分子亦将给以应得处分。
