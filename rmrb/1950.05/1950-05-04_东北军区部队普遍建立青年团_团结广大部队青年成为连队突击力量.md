Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd: The organization of the New Democratic Youth League has been universally established in the troops of the Northeast Military Region, and has initially played an active role in promoting the completion of various tasks of the troops. The organized, planned, and step-by-step establishment of the League in the Northeast Military Region troops began in September of last year. Before the League organizations were established, propaganda and education work was carried out extensively to make cadres, Communist Party members, and young people understand the significance of establishing the League. Then, some outstanding young Communist Party members were selected to run training classes for youth work cadres to cultivate backbone members for the establishment of the League. In order to gain experience in establishing the League, the troops also selected some companies with strong Communist Party work to focus on establishing the League. By December of last year, the work of establishing the League in various troops had been universally launched, and as of the end of March this year, this work has been basically completed throughout the region.

The establishment of the League in the Northeast Military Region troops was carried out under the direct leadership of the Communist Party committees at all levels. At the beginning of the establishment of the League, each unit took the Party branch as the core to unify leadership. In addition to selecting a group of outstanding young Party members to join the League and participate in the work of the Youth League, Party members also actively united and educated the young people, assigned them tasks to cultivate them, and introduced them to the League. After the establishment of the League, the Party organizations also regularly conducted education on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought for the League members, so that the political consciousness of young commanders and fighters gradually increased. Because the work of establishing the League in various troops was closely integrated with the current central work, meritorious individuals, models, and activists who emerged from actual work were all regarded as targets for developing League members, making joining the Youth League a goal that the broad masses of young people yearned for, and every young person strived to join the League with active actions.

After the Youth League was universally established, under the leadership and education of the Party, the League members actively played a backbone and leading role, united the broad masses of young soldiers, and initially became a capable assistant for the political work of the troops. They became an indispensable shock force in completing various tasks, making the companies present a new atmosphere of progress, unity, and activity. In the regularization training movement currently underway throughout the region, the League members have consistently maintained a high morale, enabling military skills to be continuously improved. For example, League member Wang Xiangqing from a certain unit only hit 13 rings in the first target practice (15 rings is passing). After active practice and organizing eight other comrades who failed to pass, they worked hard together. In the second target practice, he hit 26 rings, and the other eight comrades also hit more than 20 rings. League member Zheng Enxing from a certain unit also created a new record of four hits out of five shots in two target practices due to his diligent study. With his help, the skills of the entire class have also been generally improved. In a certain regiment, in the close combination of establishing the League and training, the target shooting results of the entire regiment exceeded the military region's requirement of three hits out of five shots, averaging 4.012 hits per shot. At the same time, the Youth League members also actively invested in the production upsurge. League members Li Zhenwen and Liu Zhanlin from a certain division's artillery battalion, first company, and three soldiers collected more than 8,000 catties of manure in twelve days; under the promotion of the League members, the company also compiled twenty-three strip baskets, overcoming the difficulty of lacking production tools. In cultural studies, the League members also showed a good style of humbly learning and helping others, so that the cultural level of the troops was rapidly improved. League member Li Shouren from a certain unit used to be illiterate, but now he has learned more than 1,300 characters. With his sincere help, Cui Yuxin, a soldier who was unwilling to study in the past, has also been diligently studying, and he has now learned more than 500 characters. The results of the cultural learning test of a Youth League group in a certain unit were generally very good in Chinese, and the arithmetic average was 83 points. In addition, since the founding of the country, the cultural and recreational life of the companies has become more active than before. In the entertainment evenings frequently held in the companies, the Youth League members are active organizers and participants. Due to their active work, the "soldiers performing for soldiers" movement in the troops has been universally launched.

　　东北军区部队普遍建立青年团
    团结广大部队青年成为连队突击力量
    【新华社沈阳三日电】新民主主义青年团的组织已在东北军区部队中普遍建立起来，且已在推动完成部队各种任务中初步发挥了积极的作用。东北军区各部队有准备、有计划、有步骤的建团工作是在去年九月以来展开的。在团的组织尚未建立前，首先广泛地进行了宣传教育工作，使干部、共产党员及青年群众了解建团的意义，然后选拔一些优秀的青年共产党员开办青年工作干部训练班，培养建团骨干。为了取得建团经验，各部队并选择了部分共产党的工作较强的连队，实行重点建团。到去年十二月各部队建团工作即普遍展开，截至今年三月底止，全区各部队这一工作已基本上结束。
    东北军区部队的建团工作，是在各级共产党党委的直接领导下进行的。建团之初，各部均以党的支部为核心，统一领导，除选拔一批优秀青年党员入团参加青年团工作外，党员并主动地团结和教育青年群众，分工培养，并介绍他们入团。建团后，党的组织对团员又经常进行马列主义和毛泽东思想的教育，使青年指战员的政治觉悟逐步提高。由于各部队的建团工作与当前中心工作密切结合，从实际工作中涌现的功臣、模范、积极分子均当作发展团员的对象，因而使加入青年团成为广大青年群众一心向往的目标，每个青年都以积极的行动争取入团。
    青年团普遍建立后，在党的领导与教育下，团员们均积极地发挥了骨干和带头作用，团结了广大的部队青年，初步成为部队政治工作的得力助手，在完成各种任务中，成为一支不可缺少的突击力量，使连队更加呈现出进步、团结、活跃的新气象。在全区正在进行的正规化练兵运动中，团员一贯保持了高涨情绪，使军事技术不断获得提高。如某部团员王相卿在第一次打靶时，仅打中十三环（十五环及格），经过积极练习，并将另外八个不及格的同志组织一起，共同苦练，第二次打靶时，他打中了二十六环，其余八个同志也都打中了二十环以上。某部团员郑恩兴亦因努力钻研，两次打靶都创造了五弹四中的新纪录。在他的帮助下，全班技术亦普遍提高。某团在建团与练兵密切结合中，全团打靶成绩超过军区五弹三中的要求，平均命中四·○一二弹。同时，青年团员也以积极行动投入生产热潮。某师炮兵营一连青年团员李振文、刘占林和三个战士在十二天内共拣粪八千余斤；该连在团员推动下，并编制了二十三个条筐，克服了缺乏生产用具的困难。在文化学习中，团员亦表现了虚心学习、帮助别人的良好作风，使部队文化水平迅速提高。某部团员李守仁过去一字不识，现在已认识了一千三百多字。在他的真诚帮助之下，从前不愿学习的战士崔玉新也勤奋学习起来了，现他已经识了五百多字。某部青年团小组文化学习测验成绩，国文一般都很好，算术平均为八十三分。此外，自建国后，各连队文娱生活都较前普遍活跃起来。在连队经常举行的娱乐晚会中，青年团员是积极的组织者与参加者。由于他们的积极工作，部队中的“兵演兵”运动已普遍展开。
