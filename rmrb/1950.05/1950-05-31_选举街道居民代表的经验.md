[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Sixth, Seventh, and First Districts of Beijing, which are about to convene district-level People's Representative Conferences, have gained some experience in electing street resident representatives (including industrial and commercial households). The Sixth and Seventh Districts have now universally convened street representative conferences and elected all the street resident representatives to the district-level People's Representative Conferences. The streets in the First District are in the process of electing street representatives. During the election process, residents in the various districts and streets gradually understood what the district-level People's Representative Conference was all about and expressed that they attached great importance to it.

Before the universal roll-out of the elections, the three districts each selected one or two areas, concentrated cadre strength, conducted key election trials, obtained preliminary experience and lessons, and summarized them. Based on this experience, the preparatory committees then dispatched working groups to universally roll out the elections in the various streets within the districts. In the election work, they generally corrected the initial idea of underestimating the masses' level of awareness, and also corrected the work style of not daring to let go. In propaganda work, they changed the method of simply relying on meetings and reciting the "Organizational Regulations," which was divorced from the masses. The general working steps are: convening mass meetings to explain the nature of the district representative conference and the method of generating representatives; after an appropriate period, convening street resident meetings in units of dozens of households to elect street representatives and simultaneously collect opinions; finally, convening street representative meetings in units of police station jurisdictions to elect district representatives, and simultaneously compiling the various opinions collected by the street representatives from the residents, preparing them for submission to the district representatives for organization and discussion at the district-level People's Representative Conference. Before the elections, it was generally emphasized that the main conditions for being elected as a representative were: being able to represent the local residents in reflecting opinions and demands to the government, and assisting the district people's government (district office) in communicating policies and contacting the masses. They corrected the idea of some citizens that "only those who are eloquent and have nothing to do can be representatives." The election method generally adopted the method of discussion and proposals by the masses. Therefore, some places had candidates, and some places did not have candidates; the number of candidates also varied, and the voting methods were also diverse (there were already several types such as voting by ballot, casting beans, raising hands, circling names, and drawing lines). This working style of fully promoting democracy by relying on the masses was warmly supported by the vast majority of street residents.

The experience of the Sixth, Seventh, and First Districts proves that as long as appropriate propaganda work is carried out to make street residents understand the nature of the district People's Representative Conference, they will naturally attach great importance to it and carefully elect representatives who can truly represent them and do things for everyone. Taking the Third and Fourth Police Stations of the Seventh District as an example: the two stations have a total of 1,871 households. Adopting the principle of relying on the masses to conduct elections, a total of 36 street representatives were elected, 30 of whom were more enthusiastic about serving the masses and had already been elected by the residents as leaders of security groups, members of security groups, or leaders of hygiene groups. After these street representatives were elected, the masses actively put forward their opinions and asked them to convey them to the district representatives. At the street representative meeting held on the 26th, these street representatives enthusiastically expressed their opinions. Within 25 minutes, a total of 19 representatives spoke and put forward 24 constructive criticisms and suggestions, including 17 categories of issues and specific suggestions related to the welfare of local residents, such as cadre work style, municipal construction, culture and education, hygiene, economy, and public security. Su Mengchun, a cart worker who was elected as a district representative at the meeting, said: "Everyone elected me as a representative, which is like building a bridge. I will definitely bring matters related to everyone's welfare to the government."

Currently, the district and street representatives of the three districts are continuing to collect opinions from street residents. Xie Jinghuai, an old shoemaker in Langfang Santiao, said: "It will be easier to handle things in the future. There will be places to speak about big and small matters." Wang Jintang, the manager of Taifenglou Restaurant at Meishi Bridge, said: "Don't be afraid of not recognizing the goods, just be afraid of comparing goods. There are too many differences between the current People's Government and the previous reactionary governments!"

　　选举街道居民代表的经验
    【京市新闻处讯】即将召开区各界人民代表会议的京市第六、第七、第一等三个区，对选举街道居民代表（包括工商业户）获得了一些经验。现在第六、第七两个区已普遍召开过街代表会议，选出了区各界人民代表会议的全部街道居民代表。第一区各街道正在选举街代表。各区街道居民在选举过程中逐渐懂得区各界人民代表会议是怎么一回事，并且都表示很重视。
    在普遍展开选举以前，三个区都分别选择了一两个地区，集中干部力量，进行重点的选举试验，取得初步的经验和教训，加以总结，根据这种经验，再由筹备委员会派出工作组分别到区内各街道普遍展开选举。在选举工作中一般都纠正了初期对群众的觉悟程度估计过低的想法，也纠正了不敢放手的工作作风。在宣传工作上，改变了单纯依靠开会和朗诵“组织通则”等脱离群众的方式。一般的工作步骤是：召开群众会议，说明区代表会议的性质，和代表产生办法，经过适当时间后，以几十户为单位，召集街道居民会议，选举街代表同时收集意见，最后以派出所辖区为单位，召开街代表会议，选举区代表，同时把街代表从居民中所收集的各种意见，汇集起来，准备交由区代表整理后，提交区各界人民代表会议讨论。选举进行之前，一般强调说明了当选为代表的主要条件是：能够代表当地居民向政府反映意见和要求，并协助区人民政府（区公所）传达政策和联系群众。把一部分市民“只有能说会道又闲着无事的人才能当代表”的思想改正了。选举的方式一般采取由群众讨论与提出的办法，因此，有的地方有候选人，有的地方没有候选人；候选人名额的多少也各不相同，投票的方式也多种多样（已有票选、投豆、举手、圈名、划道等几种）。这种依靠群众充分发扬民主的作风，受到广大街道居民的热烈拥护。
    第六、第七、第一等三个区的经验证明：只要进行了适当的宣传工作，使街道居民懂得区人民代表会议的性质，他们就自然会以高度的重视，慎重地选出真正能代表自己为大家办事的代表。以第七区第三第四两派出所为例：两所共有居民一千八百七十一户，采取依靠群众进行选举的方针，共选出街代表三十六人，其中三十人都是比较热心为群众服务，早已为居民选为治安组长，治安组员或卫生组长的积极分子。当这些街道代表选出之后，群众纷纷提出自己的意见，请他们转达给区代表。在二十六日举行的街代表会上，这些街代表们热烈发表意见，二十五分钟内共有代表十九人发言，提出了二十四项建设性的批评和建议，包括干部作风，市政建设、文教、卫生、经济、治安等十七类有关当地居民福利的问题和具体的建议。会上当选为区代表的排子车工人苏孟春说：“大家选上我做代表，就算搭了座桥，有关大家福利的事情，我一定好好把它带给政府。”
    现在三个区的区、街代表正在继续收集街道居民的意见。廊房三条老皮匠谢景槐说：“以后就好办了，大、小事情都有地方说话了。”煤市桥泰丰楼饭店经理王继堂说：“不怕不认货就怕货比货，现在的人民政府跟以往的反动政府一比，不同的地方太多了！”
