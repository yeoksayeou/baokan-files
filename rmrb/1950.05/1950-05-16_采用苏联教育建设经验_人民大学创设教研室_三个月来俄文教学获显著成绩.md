　　Adopting Soviet Education Construction Experience
　  Renmin University Establishes Teaching and Research Sections
　　Significant Achievements in Russian Language Teaching in Three Months

    [Our Newspaper] Reporter Jin Feng reports: Renmin University of China has absorbed the advanced experience of Soviet higher education construction and established a new teaching organization—the teaching and research section (equivalent to the lecture halls in Soviet universities). The Russian Language Teaching and Research Section, which was established earliest, under the direct help and guidance of Soviet professors, is implementing the teaching policy of combining Soviet experience with Chinese conditions, and has achieved preliminary results in leading teaching.
    The lecture hall in Soviet universities is a teaching institution organized by specialized disciplines, and its main tasks include teaching, research, improving faculty, and training graduate students. Renmin University of China has currently established six teaching and research sections, including Marxism-Leninism, Theory of Chinese Revolution, Finance and Economics, Law and Diplomacy, Russian Language, and Education. Under each teaching and research section, there are several teaching and research groups. All teaching and research sections are directly under the dual leadership of the Academic Affairs Department, which is responsible for teaching administration, and the Research Department, which is responsible for teaching research.
    The Russian Language Teaching and Research Section was established as early as January of this year. It initially led the Russian language teaching of the Russian Language Training Class, and now it is responsible for the Russian language teaching of more than 2,700 students in undergraduate programs, Russian Language Training Class, and cadre night schools. The teaching and research section has one director (the current director is Soviet professor Chevikova, former director of the Russian Language Lecture Hall of Moscow Normal College), twenty-four Chinese and Soviet teachers, and one secretary.
    The work completed by this teaching and research section in the past three months mainly includes: formulating and approving the two-year teaching syllabus for the Russian Language Training Class, the time ratio table of the two-year course, and the teaching outline for one semester (180 hours); compiling and reprinting textbooks for the elementary and advanced classes. At seven working meetings and fourteen teaching method seminars, typical teaching reports were organized, teaching experiences were exchanged, and eight special reports on Russian language teaching were heard from Soviet professors (the important ones include the work tasks of the Russian Language Teaching and Research Section, the development and changes of the Russian language after the October Revolution, the Russian language teaching method in non-Soviet schools, and the explanation method of new words), and Professor Chevikova, the director, summarized the opinions on lectures after auditing the lectures of the teaching staff sixty-four times, the work summary of the teaching and research section for three months, and the report on the examination summary.
    The teaching effect is generally very good, which can be proved from the students' grades. In the first test of 511 students in the Russian Language Training Class, those with excellent grades accounted for 79%, those with average grades accounted for 19%, and those with poor grades accounted for only 2%. Among them, those with excellent grades in the experimental class accounted for 93%, and those with average grades accounted for 7%.
            Grasp the key points and first solve the textbooks and teaching methods.
    The key to the success of the Russian Language Teaching and Research Section in organizing and leading teaching lies in adopting the method of grasping the key points, gradually advancing, cultivating typical examples, and promoting the general. According to the existing human and material resources of the teaching and research section, the Russian Language Teaching and Research Section first determined that leading the teaching work was the primary task of this stage. In the teaching work, it focused on solving the two problems of textbooks and teaching methods. The Soviet teachers of the teaching and research section, after studying the current general Russian textbooks, believed that these textbooks did not reflect actual life enough, lacked political and ideological content, and did not meet the needs of the students. Therefore, the textbook problem urgently needed to be solved. Secondly, although Soviet teachers had certain teaching experience in Russian language teaching, it was still necessary to study and solve how to use this experience to teach Chinese students. First, the Chinese and Soviet teachers of the teaching and research section were organized to establish a regular meeting system; Professor Chevikova, the director of the teaching and research section, formulated a two-year teaching syllabus and a one-semester teaching plan based on the Soviet teaching principles for non-Soviet students learning Russian. This work laid the foundation for conducting planned, organized, and led teaching. Secondly, Professor Chevikova and Associate Professor Maksimova were responsible for compiling lively and concise textbooks that combined theory with practice and were permeated with political and ideological content, including texts such as Crossing the Yangtze River, Chinese People's Leader Mao Zedong, Labor Hero Li Fenglian, Driver Li Yong, and Stalin on the Chinese Revolution. In addition, teaching seminars, academic reports, and typical teaching reports were used to improve the professional level of teachers.
            Establish experimental classes, cultivate typical examples, and learn from experience.
    At the same time, the teaching and research section established experimental classes from the beginning as a typical example for learning teaching experience. The experimental class was directly controlled by Associate Professor Maksimova. A series of new teaching methods were adopted, starting with conversation instead of letters, and the newly compiled textbooks were gradually tried out. As a result, the experimental class mastered 1,200 new words in three months, and it is expected that it will be possible to achieve the teaching results scheduled for two years in one year. Therefore, the textbooks compiled by the teaching and research section and the new Russian teaching methods have now been adopted in the undergraduate programs of the university.
    The achievements of the three months of work prove that the teaching focus, work steps, and cultivation of typical examples adopted by the Russian Language Teaching and Research Section are correct and successful, and have laid a good foundation for gradually establishing a complete teaching and research section. Now, the key to consolidating these achievements and further improving the work of the Russian Language Teaching and Research Section lies in strengthening the leadership of students' learning, implementing and expanding teaching effects, and, to the extent possible, carrying out work related to teaching, such as improving faculty and research. To this end, the teaching and research section has recently organized Chinese and Soviet teachers to conduct political studies, formulate personal teaching plans and research plans, and make summaries of each person's teaching work. In the Russian language courses of the undergraduate programs, a tutoring system has also been established. In the classes lectured by Soviet teachers, Chinese teachers conduct tutoring for two hours a week, focusing on answering questions. In the classes lectured by Chinese teachers, Soviet teachers conduct tutoring, focusing on correcting pronunciation. This overcomes the difficulties encountered by students in digesting the new teaching methods adopted in the undergraduate programs.

　　采用苏联教育建设经验
　  人民大学创设教研室
　　三个月来俄文教学获显著成绩
    【本报讯】记者金凤报道：中国人民大学吸取苏联高等教育建设的先进经验，创设了新的教学组织——教研室（相当于苏联大学的讲座）。其中最早成立的俄文教研室，在苏联教授的直接帮助和指导下，执行着苏联经验与中国情况相结合的教学方针，在领导教学方面，已取得初步成绩。
    苏联大学的讲座是以专门学科为单位组织的教学机构，主要任务包括教学、研究、提高师资和培养研究生等四项。中国人民大学目前已设立了马列主义、中国革命理论、财政经济、法律外交、俄文、教育等六个教研室，在每个教研室下面，分设若干个教研组。所有教研室直接受负责教学行政工作的教务部和负责教学研究的研究部的双重领导。
    俄文教研室早在本年一月成立，最初领导俄文专修班的俄文教学工作，现在则负责大学本科、俄文专修班、干部夜校等二千七百多学生的俄文教学工作。教研室有主任一人（现任主任为苏联教授契维珂娃，前莫斯科师范学院俄文讲座主任），中苏教员二十四人及秘书一人。
    这个教研室三个月来所完成的工作，主要有：拟定并通过了俄文专修班的两年教学纲要、两年课程的时间比例表以及一学期（一百八十小时）的教学讲授提纲；编写和翻印了初级班和高级班的课本。在七次工作会议和十四次教学法座谈会上，组织了典型的教学报告，交流了教学经验，听取了苏联教授关于俄文教学的八次专题报告（重要的有俄文教研室的工作任务，十月革命后俄国语言的发展和变化，非苏联学校的俄语教授法，生字的解释法等），听取了主任契维珂娃教授旁听教员讲课六十四次后所作的关于讲课的意见总结、教研室三个月的工作总结以及考试总结的报告。
    教学的效果一般甚好，从学生的成绩中可以得到证明。俄文专修班五百十一个学生第一次考试的测验成绩，优等者占百分之七十九，中等者占百分之十九，较差者仅占百分之二。其中实验班成绩优等者占百分之九十三，中等者占百分之七。
            抓住重点，首先解决教材与教学法。
    俄文教研室运用组织领导教学取得成绩的关键，在于采取了抓住重点，逐步推进、培养典型、推动一般的办法。根据教研室现有的人力物力，俄文教研室首先确定了以领导教学工作为此一阶段的首要任务。而教学工作中，又着重解决教材和教学法两问题，教研室的苏联教员，在研究了目前一般的俄文课本以后，认为这些课本反映实际生活不够，缺乏政治思想内容，不合学员的需要。因此教材问题，迫切需要解决。其次，苏联教员在俄文教学上虽都有了一定的教学经验，但对于如何运用此等经验来教导中国学生，仍需要研究解决。首先，教研室的中苏教员组织起来，建立了定期的会议制度；教研室主任契维珂娃教授，根据苏联教授非苏联籍学生俄语的教学原则，拟订了两年教学纲要和一学期的教学计划。这些工作即为进行有计划、有组织、有领导的教学打下基础。其次，由契维珂娃教授和马克西莫娃副教授负责，编写了生动精简、结合实际，贯穿了政治思想内容的教材，包括了像抢渡扬子江、中国人民领袖毛泽东、劳动英雄李凤莲、司机李永、斯大林论中国革命等课文。此外，又通过教学座谈会、学术报告，教学典型报告等开始提高教员的业务水平。
            设立实验班，培养典型，吸取经验。
    同时，教研室一开始就设立了实验班作为吸取教学经验的典型。实验班由马克西莫娃副教授直接掌握。采用了不从字母开始而从会话开始的一系列新的教学法，并逐步试用所编的新教材。结果实验班于三个月内，掌握了一千二百个生字，预计一年就可能达到预定为期两年的教学成绩。因此目前大学本科都已采用了教研室所编的教材和新的俄语教学法。
    三个月的工作成就，证明俄文教研室所采取的教学重点，工作步骤以及培养典型是正确的和成功的，已为逐渐建立完备的教研室打下了良好的基础。现在，俄文教研室需要巩固这些成绩和进一步提高工作的关键，在于加强领导学生的学习，贯彻和扩大教学效果以及在可能的条件下，展开与教学工作有密切关系的提高师资和研究的工作。为此，教研室最近已组织中苏教员进行政治学习，拟订个人的教学计划、研究计划和作出各人的教学工作总结。在大学本科的俄文课中，并建立了辅导制。苏联教员主讲班上每周有两小时由中国教员进行辅导，着重解答问题。在中国教员主讲班上，由苏联教员进行辅导，着重纠正发音。这样克服了在大学本科采用新教学法时所遇到的学生消化不了的困难。
