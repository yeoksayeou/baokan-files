　　Everyone Works Hard to Improve Management
　　No. 2 Middle School Students' Food is Improved
    [Our News] The municipal No. 2 Middle School student cafeteria improved management, and the students' lives have improved. Last spring, the school cafeteria was run very poorly, and the students could only drink boiled water every day, eating rice with vegetable soup and pickles. Now, each person still contributes 50 jin of millet per month, but can regularly eat tofu, bean sprouts, radishes, fried tofu, as well as four meat meals, six eggs and two steamed bun meals per month. The corn buns were also changed to high-quality corn flour. The original system of rotating meal committee members has been replaced by a competitive election system. The main reasons for the achievements are: First, improving management methods: In the past, there were too few meal committee members, and the division of labor was unscientific. For example, the general affairs department often had nothing to do, forming a virtual structure; other departments, especially the meal committee members responsible for purchasing, were so busy that they delayed regular classes, seriously affecting their work mood. Subsequent meal committees adjusted the work of each department based on this situation, dividing the work according to each person's strengths, and the situation improved. Second, improving the relationship with the cooks: The old education made students look down on labor and working people, and they did not care about or help the cooks' work and life; they also monitored them at all times, fearing that they would "cheat". This made the cooks unwilling to do their work well. After liberation, after a period of political study, students and meal committee members began to take the initiative to approach the cooks in their lives, helping them with some odd jobs, solving some specific problems, and mobilizing them to participate in night school, teaching them to study culture and politics. They often listened to their opinions in their work. The cooks felt warmth, became active and responsible in their work, and automatically rejected the "kickbacks" money given to them by merchants, carefully calculating and trying to save money everywhere. Work efficiency has also improved: in the past, four people made food for 120 people, but now three people make food for 350 people. Third, mobilizing students to run the cafeteria together: In the past, most students only blamed the shortcomings of the cafeteria and did not actively help the meal committee members think of ways to overcome them. Since the No. 2 Middle School cafeteria established an opinion box and a system of regularly reporting work to students and collecting student opinions at any time, the situation has changed. Students began to automatically think of ways for the cafeteria, often helping the cafeteria understand market conditions in order to carefully calculate costs.

　　大家努力改进管理
　　二中同学伙食得到改善
    【本报讯】市立二中学生伙食团改进管理，同学生活得到改善。去春，该校伙食办得很坏，同学们每天只能喝开水，用菜汤、咸菜下饭。现在每人每月仍出五十斤小米，却能经常吃上豆腐、豆芽、萝卜、炸豆腐以及每月四顿肉，六个鸡蛋和两顿馒头。窝窝头也换了上等玉米面。并以争相竞选的膳委制度代替了原来轮流推派的膳委制度。获得成绩的主要原因是：一、改进管理方法：过去膳委太少，分工不科学。如总务部经常没事作，形成虚设；其他各部尤其是负责采购的膳委却忙得耽误正课，严重地影响工作情绪。后来的几届膳委，即根据这一情况对各部工作作了调整，分工按照每人的特长，情况为之好转。二、搞好与炊事员的关系：旧教育使同学们瞧不起劳动和劳动人民，对炊事员的工作和生活不关心、不帮助；并时刻监视，怕他们“作弊”。这就使炊事员无心作好工作。解放后，经过一段政治学习，同学、膳委们开始主动地从生活上接近炊事员，帮他们作一些零碎工作，解决一些具体问题，动员他们参加夜校，教他们学习文化和政治。在工作中经常听取他们的意见。炊事员们感到了温暖，工作积极负责起来，自动拒绝了商人给自己的“底子”钱，处处精打细算，力图节省。工作效率也提高了：过去四个人做一百二十人的饭，现在三个人却做三百五十人的饭。三、发动同学大家办伙食：过去大多数同学只责备伙食上的缺点，并不积极地帮助膳委想出克服的办法。二中的伙食团自从设立了意见箱，并定期向同学做工作报告、随时搜集同学意见的制度以来，情况就变了，同学们开始自动地为膳团想办法，经常帮助膳团了解市场情况，以便于精打细算。
