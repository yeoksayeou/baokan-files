Baodi Checks Cadre Style
Corrects Coercive Commandism in Mobilizing Laborers

[Our Newspaper News] In the spring mobilization of laborers for river management work in Baodi County, Hebei Province, some districts and villages experienced coercive commandism and apportionment, increasing the burden on the people. The county suffered severe flooding last year, with many young and middle-aged people going out to make a living. The mobilization of laborers for river management coincided with the masses' widespread engagement in sideline production. Rural labor was scarce, but the general public responded to the government's call with high production enthusiasm, completing arduous tasks and mobilizing 13,500 laborers to participate in river management projects. However, shortcomings also occurred during the work. The main problem was that some district and village cadres failed to thoroughly and widely publicize the relationship between river management projects and the vital interests of the masses, and to explain the methods of spring labor mobilization. This caused some people to have concerns, such as people in Yuanzhuangzi fearing being "conscripted to fight," and many not believing that the government would pay laborers. They said, "Since ancient times, we have never seen anyone getting paid for digging rivers." Some cadres did not take effective measures to explain and persuade the masses about these misunderstandings, but instead used commandism to forcibly assign and apportion tasks. Some even adopted the erroneous method of apportioning the hiring of laborers. For example, Lintingkou formed groups of eight young and middle-aged people, each group required to send three laborers. Some groups therefore paid money to hire substitutes. Nanzaigu apportioned grain to hire laborers based on land area, with each mu of land paying four jin of red grain. In Bamencheng, the village "assigned" people, and whoever was assigned had to go, or pay money to hire someone else. These phenomena not only increased the burden on the people in the disaster area and undermined the village financial system, but also affected the morale of the laborers. Some laborers had a mercenary attitude and were merely going through the motions, resulting in low work efficiency, and some even fled. After discovering these shortcomings, the Baodi County People's Government immediately instructed all districts to conduct inspections and corrections, and sent responsible cadres to two districts to inspect and handle the situation. Cadres in districts and villages who presided over the hiring of laborers and coercive commandism were subject to criticism and education based on the severity of their cases. The money apportioned by villages for hiring laborers was to be returned to the original owners. At the same time, it was clearly stated that in the future, anyone who arbitrarily allocated grain or funds would be acting illegally, and the people had the right to refuse to pay and report to the higher-level government. County departments also sent cadres to the countryside to understand the situation of the laborers' families, and mobilized and organized the masses to exchange labor and help each other under the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, to ensure the spring plowing and weeding for the laborers' families. They also paid a portion of the laborers' wages in advance to eliminate the masses' concerns about "not getting paid" and stabilize the lives of the laborers' families. In addition, they mobilized the laborers' families to write letters to the laborers to reassure them and allow them to work with peace of mind.

　　宝坻检查干部作风
    纠正动员民工中强迫命令现象
    【本报讯】河北省宝坻县在今年春季动员民工治河的工作中，部分区村发生了强迫命令与摊派现象，加重了人民负担。该县去年遭受严重水灾，不少青壮年外出谋生，动员民工治河时又值群众广泛进行副业生产之际，农村劳动力不足，而一般群众均能以高度生产热情响应政府号召，完成了艰巨任务，动员了一万三千五百民工参加治河工程。但工作过程中也发生了缺点，主要是一部分区村干部未能深入广泛宣传治河工程与群众切身利益的关系，并解释春工动员办法，因此使一部分群众发生顾虑，如袁庄子有人怕“调去打仗”，很多人不相信政府发给民工工资。他们说：“自古以来就没见过挖河给工钱的。”对群众这些误解，部分干部不采取有效办法，加以解释说服，而以命令主义方式，强拨硬派，有的更采取摊派雇工的错误办法。如林亭口把青壮年编成八人一组，每组出三个民工；有的组因此就拿钱雇人代替；南在沽按地亩派粮雇工，每亩地纳四斤红粮；八门城是由村“派”，派到谁谁就去，不去就花钱雇人。上述现象不但加重了灾区人民负担，破坏了村财政制，而且影响了民工的情绪，一部分民工存在雇佣观点与应付思想，工作效率低，还有逃亡的。宝坻县人民政府发现这些缺点后，除立即指示各区检查纠正外，并派负责干部赴两个区检查处理。对主持雇工与强迫命令严重的区村干部，决定根据情节予以批评教育；各村因雇工的摊派要退回原主；同时明令申明，今后任何人随便派粮派款均为非法，人民有权拒交并向上级政府报告。县各部门并派干部下乡了解民工家属情况，发动与组织群众在自愿两利原则下换工互助，保证民工家的春耕锄麦，并提前发下一部分民工工资，以消除群众“怕不发工资”的顾虑，安定民工家属生活。此外，又动员民工家属给民工写信，使其安心工作。
