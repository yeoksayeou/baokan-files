Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 13th—To overcome the phenomenon in Wuhan enterprises of complicated meetings and excessive concurrent positions for cadres, which seriously hinders production, the Enterprise Party Committee of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently issued a decision on streamlining meetings and reducing concurrent positions for cadres. The decision specifically stipulates the number of times and duration of various meetings to be held each month by the Communist Party and the Communist Youth League in enterprises, and also makes specific recommendations for reducing the number of meetings held by trade unions, factory management committees, and labor-management consultation committees. The decision emphasizes that the convening of meetings should be well prepared, and that one or two central issues for discussion should be clearly proposed, and specific resolutions should be made. Personnel in charge of meetings should frequently go deep into the masses, study problems, and break the incorrect views of "meetings are the only way to be democratic" and "major and minor issues should be resolved at meetings." Regarding concurrent positions for cadres, the decision requires that cadres who are detached from production and those who are not detached from production should hold no more than three positions; at the same time, the main positions of cadres detached from production should not be changed easily, and the main task of cadres not detached from production should be production work. The decision also requires Party organizations in enterprises to attach importance to the work of cultivating cadres in order to fundamentally solve the problem of excessive concurrent positions for cadres.

Currently, the situation of complicated meetings and excessive concurrent positions for cadres in Wuhan enterprises is quite serious. The Wuhan Telecommunications Bureau has as many as 48 types of meetings, and an administrative cadre has to attend 42 meetings every month. A member of the Communist Youth League at the Wuchang Railway Station of the Yuehan Railway holds six positions concurrently and is busy with meetings all day long. Therefore, some production activists are unwilling to be models or cadres; the promoted worker cadres often feel distressed because they cannot concentrate on learning and cannot do their work well; and in some enterprises, workers have become overworked due to excessive meetings, resulting in reduced wages and lower production efficiency.

　　中共武汉市委企业党委会决定
　　精简会议减少干部兼职
    以免严重妨害生产工作
    【新华社汉口十三日电】为克服武汉市企业中会议繁琐、干部兼职过多因而严重妨害生产的现象，中共武汉市委企业党委会于最近发出关于精简会议、减少干部兼职的决定。决定具体规定了企业中共产党和青年团每月召开各种会议的次数和时间，并对减少工会、工厂管理委员会和劳资协商委员会等会议次数，提出具体建议。决定强调召集会议应有充分准备，要做到明确提出一两个中心讨论问题，作出具体决议。会议负责人员应经常深入群众，研究问题，打破“开会才算民主”、“大事小事会上解决”的不正确的观点。在干部兼职方面，该决定要求脱离生产的和不脱离生产的干部最多以担任三个职务为限；同时，脱离生产干部的主要职务不应轻易变动，不脱离生产的干部则应以生产工作为其主要任务。决定并要求企业中党的组织重视培养干部的工作，以根本解决干部兼职过多的问题。
    目前，武汉市企业中会议繁琐、干部兼职多的情形是相当严重的。武汉电信局的会议曾有四十八种之多，一个行政干部每月须参加四十二次会议。粤汉路武昌车站一个团员身兼六职，整天忙于开会。因此，有些生产积极分子都不愿当模范或做干部；被提拔的工人干部则常以学习不能专一、工作无法做好而感苦恼；有些企业中并已发生工人因会议过多而过度疲劳、工资收入减少、生产效率降低的现象。
