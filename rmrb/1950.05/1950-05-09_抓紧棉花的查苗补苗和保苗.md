Last year, excessive autumn rains in various regions resulted in poor maturity and low germination rates of cotton seeds. For example, among the cotton seeds purchased, those produced near Shanghai had an estimated 40% to 60% full seeds with a germination rate of 30% to 50%; those produced in Zhejiang had an estimated 70% to 80% full seeds with a germination rate of 50% to 70%. If these cotton seeds are distributed to farmers without increasing the sowing quantity, uneven emergence is likely, reducing yields. The cotton seeds adjusted and allocated to other regions this year also generally have lower germination rates. In some places, the emergence rate after sowing is only 40% to 50%, and in some cases even lower. Therefore, at this critical moment before and after the "Start of Summer" solar term, when it is still not too late to plant cotton, it is extremely necessary for all regions to inspect the intensive cotton planting campaign, mobilize the masses to conduct seedling inspection, replanting, and protection to ensure a normal cotton harvest.

　　1. Organize Seedling Inspection: Cotton-producing provinces, special districts, counties, districts, and villages should plan and organize district and village cotton-planting cadres and activists to take the lead in mobilizing the masses to carry out a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of cotton planting. This work should first understand the degree of completion of the cotton planting task, checking the actual sown area and the quality of varieties; secondly, pay attention to the seedling emergence situation, and promptly guide replanting or transplanting seedlings where missing seedlings are found to ensure the harvest; for parts where the task has not yet been completed, leadership should be provided to mobilize them to sow as soon as possible and strive to complete it on schedule.

　　2. Replanting and Transplanting Seedlings: After cotton seedlings emerge, missing seedlings must be filled immediately. Sowing is still not too late at present, and replanting with the same variety of cotton seeds can be done, which can be easily successful, saving labor and time. If there are no remaining seeds available for replanting, or if the sowing season has passed and missing seedlings are found, transplanting seedlings should be carried out. Last year, North China suffered from severe spring drought, and the Shijiazhuang area had many missing seedlings in cotton fields. Some farmers used the transplanting method to remedy the situation.

　　The method of transplanting seedlings is: first, fully water the cotton seedlings to be transplanted (no watering is required in shady and humid areas or after rain). After the water has penetrated, use a small shovel to dig out the seedlings along with the soil (the size of the soil block should be about three inches square and five inches deep, being careful not to break up the soil block and expose the cotton roots), and move them into the previously dug pits for missing seedlings, then backfill the soil around them, and then water them again. Transplanting cotton seedlings is best done when true leaves appear. This transplanting method is generally successful and does not hinder seedling development. If transplanting is done on a cloudy day, the effect is even better.

　　3. Seedling Protection and Thinning: After cotton sowing, if heavy rain is encountered before emergence, and the weather clears after the rain, the surface of the cotton rows often forms a layer of mud, and the cotton buds are unable to break through, resulting in bending and curling inside and inability to emerge. In this case, the soil should be lightly raked to help them emerge. After emergence, if it rains, the land should be hoed (i.e., cultivated) immediately after the rain to remove weeds. This method is essential in both rainy and dry years because it can maintain moisture and nutrients in the soil and loosen and dry the surface, preventing the occurrence of diseases (mainly seedling blight and anthracnose).

　　In addition, when the cotton seedlings grow to two or three inches high, thinning must be carried out. Thinning should not be carried out too early, as there may be missing seedlings that cannot be remedied. However, it should not be too late, as it will deplete the soil and affect seedling development. Generally, thinning can be carried out in two or three stages, with the final stage being the determination of seedling spacing. The first thinning is carried out when the seedlings are two or three inches high. Whether using hands to pull or hoes to shovel, care should be taken not to disturb the good seedlings to be retained, and even more so not to leave excessive gaps in the soil around the roots, so as to avoid ventilation and damage to the cotton roots. The first thinning is to temporarily adjust the seedlings that are sparse and uneven, slightly averaging the distance, leaving a strong seedling approximately every three or four inches apart. "Leave sparse where dense, leave dense where sparse, and leave the big ones where neither sparse nor dense," this is the key to thinning work. The last thinning is to determine seedling spacing when the seedlings are four or five inches high. This time, attention should be paid to the position of the seedlings left in each row, not overlapping with the seedlings left in adjacent rows, and leaving the seedlings at least in the middle of the two seedlings in the adjacent row. In this way, the cotton branches will extend and interlock in the future, without excessive conflict and crowding. As for the distance between plants, it should be determined according to the width of the row spacing and the fertility of the land. For example, if the row spacing of American cotton is two feet, then the plant spacing is usually about one foot to one foot two inches. On fertile land, the plant spacing can be further increased, and on barren land, it can be shortened. In paddy fields, it can be further, and in dry land, it should be closer. However, be careful: "Have money to buy seeds, but no money to buy seedlings!" It is absolutely impermissible to have wide row spacing and barren land, and then further increase the plant spacing. In this way, because the number of cotton seedlings is too small, it is practically equivalent to missing seedlings, which will inevitably affect the harvest.

　　抓紧棉花的查苗补苗和保苗
    中央人民政府农业部工业原料司
    去年各地秋雨过多，棉种的成熟度较差，发芽率低。例如收购的棉种，上海附近产的，饱满籽估计有百分之四十至六十，发芽率为百分之三十至五十；浙江产的，饱满籽估计有百分之七十至八十，发芽率百分之五十至七十。这些棉种贷发给农民以后，倘若不增加播种量，就很可能出苗不齐，减少产量。其他地区本年所调剂的棉种，一般的发芽率也都较低，有的地方播种后出苗率才到四、五成，有的甚而更低。因此在这“立夏”节前后，种棉犹不为迟的紧要关头，各地于检查突击植棉同时，发动群众，进行查苗补苗和保苗，以保证棉花正常的收成是极为必要的。
    一、组织查苗  各产棉省、专、县、区、村，有计划有组织地发动区村种棉干部、积极分子带头，把群众组织起来，展开普遍深入的植棉情况大检查。这一工作，首先要了解植棉任务完成的程度，检查其实际播种的面积及品种优劣；其次要注意其出苗情况，凡发现有缺苗的，应即指导其补种或移苗，以保证收成；对尚未完成任务的部分，则应领导与发动其尽速播种，争取如期完成。
    二、补种移苗  棉苗出土后，一见有缺苗，必须立刻补齐。目前播种尚不为迟，可用同一品种的棉籽，施行补种，即可成活，且省工省时，最为妥便。万一已无余种，可供补播，或播种时期已过，又发现缺苗，即当实行移苗。去年华北春旱严重，石家庄地区因棉田缺苗很多，有些农民即系应用移苗方法补救齐全的。
    移苗的方法是：先把所要移出的棉苗，充分浇水（阴湿地或雨后可不浇水）水渗透后即用小铲连苗带土铲出（土块大小，约为三寸见方，深五寸，小心别把土块弄散，露出棉根），移入预先挖好的缺苗的坑内，并在四周壅土，然后再行浇水即可。移植棉苗最好在有真叶时举行。这种移苗方法，一般多能成活，且不妨碍棉苗发育。若趁阴天移植，效果更好。
    三、保苗间苗  棉花播种后，在未出苗以前，若遇大雨，雨后天晴，棉行土面，往往结成一层泥板，棉芽无力顶破，以致蟠曲内蜷，不能出土，见此情形，须即用耙轻轻耙松以助其出苗。出苗之后，若遇天雨，雨后应随即锄地（即中耕）除草，此法无论在雨水较多或旱年，都极必要，因其既可保持土中水分养分，又可使地面疏松干燥，防除病害发生。（主要为幼苗立枯病及炭疽病）。
    此外，棉苗长高二、三寸，即须进行间苗。间苗不可进行太早，太早恐再有缺苗，无法补救，但也不可太晚，损耗地力影响棉苗发育。一般间苗可分两三次进行，最后一次定苗。第一次间苗，在苗高二、三寸时，用手拔或用锄头铲，都要注意不可牵动了要留下的好苗，更不可使根旁土壤空隙过大，以致透风，伤害棉根。第一次间苗是先把棉苗出得稀密不匀的，暂且调整一下，距离远近，略为平均，约每隔三四寸远，留一强苗。“稀留密，密留稀，不稀不密留大的，”这是间苗工作的诀窍。最后一次是在苗高四五寸时定苗，这次要注意各行留苗的位置，不和邻行的留苗并开，最低在邻行两苗中间的方位留苗，这样，将来棉枝交互伸长，不致过分抵触和拥挤。至于株距的远近，得按照行距的宽窄和土地的肥瘠酌量规定，例如美棉行距是二尺，那么株距普通约为一尺至一尺二寸。肥地尚可把株距再放远些，瘠地也可以再缩近些。水田可以远些，旱地就要近些。但是要当心：“有钱买种，无钱买苗！”万不可行距既宽，土地又瘠，而再把株距放远，这样棉苗因数目太少，实已等于缺苗，势必影响收成。
