Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 14th: The People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army Crossing-the-Sea Troops and the Qiongya Column held a grand victory celebration and meeting of cadres in Haikou on the 5th of this month. Commander Deng Hua of the Hainan Front Command, Commander Feng Baiju and Deputy Political Commissar Huang Kang of the Qiongya Column, as well as Generals Han Xianchu and Zhang Chiming, delivered important speeches at the meeting.

　　Commander Deng Hua pointed out: The complete liberation of Hainan Island this time is a great victory, which not only greatly encourages the people of the whole country, but also is a major blow to the remaining enemies. The enemy's dream of relying on the island to harass the mainland has been shattered. He said: The successful crossing-the-sea operation this time fully proves that the People's Liberation Army is invincible both on land and at sea. Commander Deng Hua particularly pointed out: The victorious liberation of Hainan Island is inseparable from the strong support of the people of the whole country, the direct cooperation of the people of Qiongya Island, and the correct leadership of the higher authorities. He finally called on everyone not to be arrogant and complacent because of victory, but to be cautious and humble, learn from each other, strengthen unity, and strive for the establishment and consolidation of Hainan's national defense.

　　Commander Feng Baiju pointed out in his speech: The heroic crossing-the-sea operation of the large army has liberated the Qiongya soldiers and civilians who have persisted in the struggle behind enemy lines for more than 20 years. Therefore, he specially expressed his respect to the large army for crossing the sea on behalf of the Qiongya Column, the Qiongya People's Government, and the broad masses of the people. He then called on all soldiers and civilians to learn from the large army, especially to learn from the combat style and work style of the large army, so as to enrich and strengthen themselves, so that the Qiongya Column, like the national liberation army, will become a powerful army of the new China. Commander Feng finally emphasized: Today, the situation in Qiongya has undergone fundamental changes. The focus of future work must shift from the countryside to the cities. We must overcome the past guerrilla style and move towards regularization.

　　Deputy Political Commissar Huang Kang and Generals Han Xianchu and Zhang Chiming also unanimously pointed out: It is necessary to learn from each other, oppose arrogance and complacency, maintain the fine style of hard work and simplicity, regularly carry out criticism and self-criticism, closely link with the masses, and advance forever with the people of Hainan Island to build a new Hainan Island and consolidate national defense.
