京市新闻处讯 [News from the Beijing Municipal News Agency]
To discuss how to implement cash management in state organs, the Municipal Finance Committee and the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China convened a symposium on the 8th, attended by the heads of the accounting departments of 46 major municipal state-owned enterprises, organs, troops, cooperatives, and other units. At the meeting, Yin Yukun, Deputy Manager of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China, first explained the significance and importance of implementing cash management, pointing out that cash management is one of the important weapons to ensure the country's planned economic construction. All cash of state-owned enterprises, organs, troops, and cooperatives, except for the prescribed limit, should be deposited into the state bank. Debt and credit relationships between organs and enterprises and downward allocation of funds should also be settled and transferred by the state bank as much as possible, so that the state can save cash, reduce issuance, strengthen capital turnover, stabilize financial prices, and concentrate the use of cash for production and construction in a planned way. In the Soviet Union, because the state bank has become the center of cash, settlement, and credit, the total amount of deposits exceeds nine times the amount of issuance and the amount of transfer is 150 times the amount of cash. The achievement of cash management in Northeast China is that the total amount of transfer reaches six times the amount of cash receipts and payments. At the same time, after the implementation of cash management, state organs themselves can simplify accounting and cashier procedures, reduce the trouble of counting and transporting cash, and reduce the waste of manpower and material resources. Regarding how to specifically carry out cash management in Beijing, Deputy Manager Yin Yukun explained that the bank's perspective is to implement government orders and serve state-owned enterprises, organs, troops, and cooperatives, striving to improve the organization and improve business procedures to ensure that collection, payment, and remittance are prompt and accurate. The steps to promote the work are to start with managing cash, then gradually prepare revenue and expenditure plans, starting with municipal-level institutions, and then extending to units outside the municipal level. The Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China has now established a "Cash Management Section," and each unit can open accounts in the various departments and offices of the branch nearby. He said: The Municipal People's Government has issued a notice to deposit cash other than the daily expenses into the bank and transfer money between each other through the bank, but there are still many units that have not implemented it. It is hoped that they will handle it strictly and conscientiously. If there are any difficulties, they should be raised at any time for joint research to overcome them. After Yin Yukun's speech, the meeting continued to conduct preliminary discussions and research on some technical issues in the implementation of cash management.

    讨论具体执行国家机关现金管理
　　财委会召集有关单位座谈
    【京市新闻处讯】为讨论如何贯彻执行国家机关现金管理，市财委会和人民银行北京分行于八日召集市属各公营企业、机关、部队、合作社等四十六个主要单位的会计部门负责人举行座谈会。会上，人民银行北京分行副经理殷玉昆首先说明实行现金管理的意义及其重要性，指出现金管理是保证国家有计划地进行经济建设的重要武器之一，把一切公营企业、机关、部队、合作社现金除去准予保留规定的限额外，全部集中存入国家银行，机关企业相互间的债权债务关系和下拨款项也尽可能由国家银行结算、转帐，从而国家就能够节约现金，减少发行，加强资金周转，稳定金融物价，有计划地集中使用现金发展生产建设。苏联由于国家银行成为现金、结算、信贷中心，存款总额超过了发行额的九倍转帐为现金的一百五十倍。东北现金管理的成绩是转帐总额达现金收付的六倍。同时实行现金管理后，各国家机关本身就可以简化会计与出纳手续，减少点款运现麻烦，减少人力物力浪费。关于北京市怎样具体进行现金管理工作，殷玉昆副经理说明在银行方面是以执行政令和为公营企业、机关、部队、合作社服务的观点出发，力求健全机构，改善业务手续，务使办理收款、付款、汇兑时作到迅速准确。工作推进的步骤是先从管理现金入手，然后逐步编制收支计划，对象先从市级机构开始，然后再推及市级以外的单位。现在人民银行北京分行已设立“现金管理科”，各单位可以就近在分行所属各部、处分散开立户头。他说：市人民政府已通令把三日经常开支以外的现金存入银行，相互间银钱往来经银行转帐，但还有不少单位没有实行，希望严格认真办理，如有困难随时提出共同研究克服。殷玉昆讲话后，会议继对执行现金管理中技术上的一些问题做了初步讨论与研究。
