　　Beijing Telecommunications Bureau Notice

　　Approved by this bureau, starting from May 1st, the methods for revising the instrument deposit fee, advance payment of telegram fees, and refunds for long-distance call fees have been revised. A summary announcement is as follows:

　　I. Instrument Deposit Refund Method: After a local call user has their telephone removed, the paid deposit fee should be refunded within three days to three months after the removal. The refund will be calculated based on the quoted price unit on the date of the refund. Refunds will not be issued after the deadline. If there are outstanding fees, they will be offset against the original deposit fee. If insufficient, the difference will be collected, and calculated based on the quoted price unit on the date of payment.

　　II. Advance Telegram Fee Refund Method: After a user declares that they are ceasing to send telegrams, all outstanding telegram fees will be offset against the advance payment. If there is still a shortfall, it must be paid. Any remaining balance will be refunded. Whether in Francs or price units, it will be calculated according to the exchange rate on the date of payment/refund. There is a one-month limit from the date of receiving the telecommunications bureau notice, after which refunds will not be issued.

　　III. Advance Long-Distance Call Fee Refund Method: Same as item II.

　　IV. Users who have their telephone removed, or declare that they are ceasing to send telegrams or make calls, starting from May 1st, will be subject to the new method. Previous users will still be subject to the old method.

　　V. If there are any questions, please call the Third Bureau at 4200 and the Third Bureau at 6643 for consultation.
