    Implementing a Labor-Capital Mutual Benefit Policy to Reasonably Resolve Disputes
    Beijing Labor Dispute Arbitration Committee Established
    [Kyoto News Agency Dispatch] In order to implement a labor-capital mutual benefit policy and reasonably resolve labor dispute incidents, the Beijing Municipal People's Government officially established the Labor Dispute Arbitration Committee on April 28th. Ma Guangdou, Deputy Director of the Labor Bureau, serves as the chairman of the committee; Li Jun, representative of the Municipal Industry Bureau, Zhang Daqing, representative of the Commerce Bureau, Zhang Chunyuan, representative of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and Zhang Xianting, representative of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, serve as members. In the future, all labor disputes that cannot be resolved through consultation and mediation will be submitted to the committee for arbitration by the Labor Bureau. When submitting to arbitration, a report and explanation should be provided to the arbitration committee regarding the consultation and mediation process, the reasons for the failure to reach an agreement, the key points of the dispute, and all relevant arbitration materials and circumstances. The arbitration committee may solicit opinions from the parties involved and witnesses and examine evidence regarding labor disputes submitted for arbitration. During the arbitration process, if it is discovered that either party has violated Article 11 of the labor dispute resolution procedures (both parties shall maintain the original state of production during the consultation, mediation, and arbitration process; the factory shall not take any actions such as closing the factory, suspending wages, suspending meals, or other reductions in treatment; the labor side shall continue production as usual and abide by labor discipline) or has engaged in other illegal activities, it may be transferred to the court for verification. If either party is dissatisfied with the arbitration decision, they should, within five days of receiving the arbitration decision, declare the reasons for their dissatisfaction to the Labor Bureau and file a lawsuit with the Municipal People's Court; however, before a final judgment is made by the court, the arbitration decision of the committee shall remain binding on the parties, and both parties shall temporarily abide by it. If the party subject to arbitration fails to file a lawsuit within the prescribed time limit and procedures, it shall be deemed that the arbitration is final, and the Labor Bureau shall announce and enforce it.
