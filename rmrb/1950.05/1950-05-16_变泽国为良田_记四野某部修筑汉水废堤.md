　　——On the Reconstruction of the Abandoned Han River Dike by a Unit of the Fourth Field Army

    A unit of the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army is undertaking the arduous task of repairing over 700,000 cubic meters of earthwork on the old Han River dike, with the aim of transforming more than 200 square kilometers of wasteland into 350,000 mu of fertile fields within the next two years.

    This more than 200 square kilometers of wasteland was created single-handedly by the Kuomintang reactionary government. In 1935, the Han River breached its banks at the Lion's Mouth, more than ten li south of Zhongxiang. Not only did the Kuomintang reactionary government fail to take rescue measures, but the corrupt officials, in order to profit from the construction of a new dike and make a fortune from the disaster, actually built a new dike – a remote dike – northward from the old breach via Dongjiaji and Luojiaji to Xinluohan Temple, abandoning the more than 200 square kilometers of land between the old and new dikes. Many of the 50,000 to 60,000 residents in this area were later swallowed by the floods, and a few who escaped drifted to other places, living a life of displacement and hardship. When the water rose, this large piece of land became a vast expanse of water; when the water receded, it became a swamp overgrown with weeds and trees. Nearby residents came here to cut grass and collect firewood when the water receded, so it was called "Chai Lake" (Firewood Lake). The "Chai Lake" created by the Kuomintang contains an unknown amount of the people's blood and tears!

    After arriving in this desolate construction area at the end of March, the PLA unit immediately began to solve the problem of housing. Braving the continuous spring rain, the officers and soldiers went to "Chai Lake" to cut grass and fell trees. In just three days, a row of neat new houses was built on the abandoned dike and on both sides of the bank. Then, they began to manufacture tools for restoring the dike.

    The most difficult task was the foundation work of the dike. The breach in the abandoned dike was overgrown with weeds and trees, and had accumulated a very thick layer of floating sand. In the deeper places, a bamboo pole 15 feet long could not reach the bottom. To build a dike five meters high and forty meters wide at the base on this foundation seemed almost impossible. The chief of staff of a certain division, who was in charge of the dike construction, relied on the masses to solve this difficulty. He invited local veteran dike workers and soldiers from the unit who had participated in the construction of the Yellow River dike to hold a forum. As a result, they devised a method of tying willow branches into small bundles, laying them on the silt, pressing them down hard, and then laying a layer of dry soil; by piling them up and pressing them down layer by layer, they finally built a solid dike foundation.

    The officers and soldiers overcame various difficulties and finally completed the preparatory work. The soldiers were bustling on the abandoned dike, singing and digging soil, working happily and intensely. On the abandoned dike and in "Chai Lake", the soldiers' loud singing voices could be heard everywhere. The soldiers who were working on the foundation, chanting in rhythm with the hammering, sang: "Arrived at the boundary line! Everyone should pay attention! Whoever doesn't work hard! Is just a watermelon rind! This hammering is good! Little Wang is really putting in a lot of effort!" After each line, everyone echoed with a forceful "Hang yo" sound.

    The construction area was equipped with an outdoor club. During rest periods, the yangko dance teams and flower stick teams from each company became active, exchanging greetings with each other. On Sundays, the soldiers wrote and performed plays, skits, and other programs. Propaganda sheds, blackboards, and dike construction newspapers all played a full role in encouraging and promoting the work.

    Thanks to the high degree of enthusiasm and initiative shown by all officers and soldiers in building the motherland, the project to repair the breaches, which was originally scheduled to take two months, can now be completed in just forty to fifty working days.

　　变泽国为良田
　　——记四野某部修筑汉水废堤
　　高巢
    人民解放军第四野战军某部担负修复汉水旧堤共七十余万土方的艰巨任务，要使二百余平方公里的荒地，在今、明两年之内变成三十五万亩良田。
    这二百多平方公里的荒地，是国民党反动政府一手造成的。一九三五年，汉水在钟祥以南十多里的狮子口出堤了。国民党反动政府不仅不设法抢救，那些贪官污吏们反为了修新堤可以多捞一笔钱，大发水灾财，竟由旧口向北经董家集、罗家集到新罗汉寺新修一道堤——遥堤，而把新旧堤之间的二百多平方公里的土地遗弃了；这一地区的五、六万居民后来有很多被洪水吞没，少数人逃出来流浪他乡，过着颠沛流离的生活。这一大块土地在水涨时，就成为一片汪洋；水退的时候，就成为一片野草杂树丛生的沼泽地带。附近的居民在水退的时候，来这里割草、打柴，所以就叫它做“柴湖”。国民党制造出来的“柴湖”，不知包含了多少人民的血和泪啊！
    解放军某部于三月底抵达这一片荒凉的施工地区后，马上着手解决营房问题。指战员们冒着连绵的春雨，到“柴湖”去割草伐木。只有三天，废堤上和堤岸两旁，就建起了一列整齐的新屋。接着就动手制造复堤的工具。
    最困难的是打堤基的工程了。在废堤的缺口上，长满了野草杂树，还淤集了很厚的浮沙，深的地方用一丈五尺长的竹杆还探不着底。在这上面要筑起五公尺高、底宽四十公尺的大堤，几乎是不可能的。指挥筑堤的某师参谋长依靠群众来解决了这困难。他请了当地的老堤工和部队中曾参加修筑黄河堤的战士们举行座谈会。结果研究出用柳条扎成小捆，铺在淤泥上，使劲往下压，再铺上一层干土；这样一层一层地堆上去，压下去，终于筑好了牢固的堤基。
    指战员们克服了种种的困难，终于完成了准备工作。战士在废堤上熙熙攘攘，战士们唱着歌、挖着土，愉快而紧张地劳动着。在废堤上，在“柴湖”中，到处都是战士们的嘹亮的歌声。打基的战士们配合着一下一下打基的节奏唱着：“到了边界地哟！大家要注意哟！谁要不努力哟！是个西瓜皮哟！这下打得好哟！小王出力真不少哟！”每唱完一句，大家就和上有力的“杭唷”声。
    施工地区里，设有野外俱乐部，在休息时，各连队的秧歌队、花棍队就活跃起来，互相进行慰问。到星期日，战士们自编自演着话剧、双簧等节目。鼓动棚、黑板报、筑堤报都充分地发挥着鼓励和推动的作用。
    由于全体指战员高度地发挥了建设祖国的劳动热情和积极性，本来预定两个月的修补缺口工程，现在只要四十到五十个工作日就可以完工了。
