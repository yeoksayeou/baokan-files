　　Diligently and conscientiously safeguard state grain
　　Hailun Grain Depot in Heilongjiang awarded by the provincial government; Laha, Nenjiang and other grain depots punished for losses of public grain
　　[Report from this newspaper] Comprehensive report from Heilongjiang Daily: Hailun Grain Depot in Heilongjiang achieved outstanding results in grain storage and was commended by the provincial government. Laha, Keshan, Nenjiang and other grain depots were poorly managed, causing serious losses to the state, and have also been appropriately punished by the provincial government.
　　Before receiving public grain last November, all employees of the Hailun Grain Depot responded to the higher authorities' call of "not wasting a single grain," dividing responsibilities, and trying their best to prevent grain from mixing with soil and turning into soil-contaminated grain, whether during grain receiving or transportation. In the grain yard, twenty-one grain platforms were built with wooden boards, seventeen soybean platforms, and one each for sorghum and corn. Each grain platform was one foot above the ground. After the grain was loaded, it was covered with three layers of matting, so that the grain would not get wet when it rained. The grain platforms were all built on both sides of the railway, resembling neat foreign houses. The grain yard was very clean, and no soil-contaminated grain could be seen in a circle. Because of good storage, none of the 65,752 tons of grain received by the grain depot has deteriorated or become moldy since winter. The entire depot had only 2,000 jin of soil-contaminated grain, all of which was swept from the road by inspectors, and is now being sent to the oil mill for oil production after manual sorting.
　　After discovering this model, the Provincial Grain Company immediately notified all counties to go to the Hailun Grain Depot to learn from it; managers and storage directors from twelve grain depots have successively visited and learned, and the feedback has been very good. The Provincial People's Government has issued a commendation for this, specially awarding the depot the title of "Grain Storage Model," and awarding a pennant. The depot's manager and deputy manager, and the chief and deputy storage directors, each received a major merit commendation.
　　In contrast, the Laha, Keshan, and Nenjiang grain depots lacked a high degree of responsibility in storing grain, causing serious losses to state property. For example, when the Laha Grain Depot rushed to deliver grain, grain was everywhere in the yard, and a pile was swept up every four or five steps, totaling more than 100 piles; causing 150 tons of first-class soybeans to become substandard soybeans. Some even defecated and urinated on the grain, and the managers did not care. Therefore, since the grain was received, there have been more than 170 tons of soil-contaminated grain, of which about ten tons were mixed with human feces, snow, and soil, making it impossible to sort. When the Provincial Grain Company went to inspect, the grain depot personnel even put forward strange arguments to defend themselves, saying: "People to the execution ground, money to the casino, grain to the grain depot, how can there be no losses?" The Keshan Grain Depot did not implement the Provincial Grain Company's storage instruction that "all grain must be off the ground before February," subjectively believing that it could all be transported out before the thaw, but it was not realized according to plan; therefore, on March 5th, the rain caused serious losses to 25,000 tons of grain that had not been taken off the ground! In addition, more than 8,000 kilograms of good soybeans became soil-contaminated grain when they fell on the ground during truck loading. In addition, the grain scattered in piles and consequently lost also reached about seven tons. During the inspection, the manager even deceived the higher authorities by saying: "There is no storage equipment." In fact, the equipment was everywhere in the yard, and there would be enough if it were used. Another example is the Nenjiang Grain Depot, where by the end of March, there were still sixty truckloads of soybeans that had not been taken off the ground. The layer of beans on the ground had already expanded, and some had even become moldy. In addition, there were sixty tons of soil-contaminated soybeans and twenty tons of corn, which need to be processed and sorted or downgraded for price differences; 10,800 kilograms of millet were impossible to sort, totaling a loss of 286.6 million Northeast currency. In addition, thirty tons of grain mixed with snow and soil were not included in the calculation. After the inspection, the grain depot has made a profound self-criticism and automatically requested punishment from the higher authorities.
　　The provincial bureau has made a decision to punish the above grain depots. Yao Jinxi, manager of the Laha Grain Depot in Nehe County, was given a major demerit, and Wu Fenglai, the security and transport director, was dismissed. The county company's manager and deputy manager were criticized because they did not pay attention in time, resulting in serious losses.

　　认真负责保管国家粮食
　　黑龙江海伦粮栈受省府奖励 
    拉哈嫩江等粮栈损失公粮受处分
    【本报讯】综合黑龙江日报消息：黑龙江海伦粮栈保管粮食获卓越成绩，受到省府通令表扬。拉哈、克山、嫩江等粮栈则保管不善，造成国家严重损失，亦已受到省府适当处分。
    去年十一月接收公粮前，海伦粮栈全体职工即响应上级“不糟踏一粒粮”的号召，分工负责，不管是收粮或运粮均尽量想办法不使粮食混进泥土变成土粮。在粮场里，并用木板搭好二十一个粮台，十七个大豆粮台，另有高粱台、苞米台各一。每个粮台均离地一尺高。粮食装好后并盖以三层席子，落雨时亦不致打湿粮食。粮台都搭在铁道两旁，有若整齐的洋房。粮场院里非常干净，走一圈也看不到土粮。就由于保管良好，故该粮栈所收的六万五千七百五十二吨粮食，自冬季以来，没有一粒粮食变质发霉。全厂土粮仅二千斤，且都是检查员从道上扫的，现经人工整理送往油坊制油。
    省粮食公司发现这种典范后，即通知各县前往向海伦粮栈学习；先后已有十二个粮栈的经理及保管主任去参观学习，反映都很好。省人民政府为此并通令表扬，特予该栈“粮食保管模范”称号，并赠奖旗一面，该栈正副经理、正副保管主任各记大功一次。
    与此相反，拉哈、克山、嫩江等三粮栈，保管粮食缺乏高度责任心，造成国家资财的严重损失。如拉哈粮栈突击送粮时，场内到处是粮，四、五步即扫一堆，共一百余堆；使一百五十吨一等豆变成了等外大豆。还有的在粮食上拉屎、拉尿，管场的也不过问，故从收粮至今，已有一百七十多吨土粮，内有十吨左右掺杂了人粪、雪、土等，根本无法加以整理了。省粮食公司去检查时，粮栈人员还提出怪论加以辩护说：“人到法场、钱到赌场、粮到粮场，那有不损失的呢？”克山粮栈不执行省粮食公司“二月前全部粮食必须离地”的保管指示，主观地认为解冻前可以全部运出，结果并未按计划实现；故三月五号天雨，使二万五千吨未离地的粮食受到严重损失！还有八千多公斤好大豆装车时落地变成了土粮食。另外，散堆各处因而受到损失的粮食亦达七吨左右。检查时经理尚欺骗上级说：“没有保管器材。”实际上场子内到处是器材扔着，用起来不会不够。再如嫩江粮栈，到三月下旬，还有六十车大豆没离地，着地一层的豆已经膨胀，部分且已霉烂。另有土粮大豆六十吨，苞米二十吨，需要加工整理或降等差价；一万零八百公斤谷子则已无法整理，共计损失达东北币二亿八千六百六十万元。还有混有雪、土的粮食三十吨未计算在内。经检查出后，该粮栈已作深刻检讨，并自动请求上级处分。
    对以上各粮栈省局已作出决定加以处分。予讷河县拉哈粮栈经理姚金喜记大过一次，保运主任吴凤来撤职处分。该县公司正副经理因未及时引起注意，致造成严重损失，亦受到批评处分。
