After the school's trade union issued a notice on the 8th responding to this movement, by the 12th, it had received 1,408 books and publications donated by the school's staff and students. These included social science books, popular political readers, worker and soldier reading materials, novels, plays, song collections, and magazines. Among them were hardcover books such as "A Short Biography of Stalin," "Selected Works of Lenin," "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," "Days and Nights," and "Port Arthur." The school's Communist Youth League branch also donated ninety copies of "China Youth" and "Democratic Youth," and the library specially selected 180 books suitable for soldiers to read. Many students also wrote cordial inscriptions on the books they donated, such as one student who wrote: "I wish you victory on the learning front. The people of the whole country know that the people's army is heroic and invincible on all fronts." (All-China Federation of Trade Unions Cadre School Trade Union Correspondent Group)
