　　Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The Hui and Han people of Linxia Prefecture, Gansu Province, under the leadership of the People's Government, have victoriously overcome the area's relatively severe spring famine this year. The district's Production and Disaster Relief Committee recently wrote a letter to the Central People's Government reporting on disaster relief work and expressing gratitude on behalf of all Hui and Han disaster victims in the district to the Central People's Government. The letter stated: Linxia Prefecture has long suffered from the dark rule and exploitation of the Chiang and Ma bandit gangs, and its people have long been impoverished. In addition, since liberation, the remnants of the Ma bandits have colluded with local habitual bandits, inciting relations between Hui and Han, creating ethnic disputes, causing nearly 100,000 disaster victims to be displaced, cattle, horses, and grain were plundered, and houses were turned into ruins, creating a serious famine. The letter, after listing the material support given to them by the People's Government, the People's Liberation Army, and people from all walks of life in various places, said: Under the above-mentioned enormous assistance and the active leadership of people's governments at all levels in production and disaster relief, our district's disaster victims have overcome the spring famine, ensuring that no one has starved to death. Most of the refugees who fled to various places have now returned, and the land has been sown. All of us disaster victims in the entire district express our heartfelt gratitude to you! And wish you good health!

　　甘肃省临夏分区
    回汉灾民度过春荒
    报告中央人民政府并致谢忱
    【新华社二十八日讯】甘肃省临夏专区回、汉人民在人民政府领导下已经胜利地度过了该区今年较严重的春荒。该区生产救灾委员会特于日前写信给中央人民政府报告救灾工作，并代表该区全体回、汉灾民向中央人民政府致谢。信中说：临夏分区由于长期受了蒋、马匪帮之黑暗统治剥削，早已民穷财尽，加之自解放后，马匪残余勾结地方惯匪，挑拨回汉关系，制造民族纠纷，致使近十万灾民流离失所，牛马粮食被掠，庐舍为墟，造成严重的灾荒。该函于列举人民政府、人民解放军及各地各界同胞对于他们的物质的支援后说：在上述的巨大帮助与各级人民政府积极领导生产救灾之下，我们全区灾民已经度过春荒，作到不饿死一个人。现逃荒各地难民大部分均已返回，土地都已下种。我们全分区灾民特向你们致衷心的谢忱！并祝你们健康！
