　　Zhang Yongde Bravely Rescues a Train Car
　　At 2:40 AM on May 5th, a burst of violent wind arose. A freight car (No. 55040) parked in the Fengtai Inspection Depot, due to the handbrake not being tightened, was blown into motion by the wind. The east side being a downward slope, the car began to slide on its own. The speed gradually increased, and it unexpectedly passed through three turnouts within the depot. At this moment, the watchman, old man Zhang Yongde, was patrolling near the east gate. Noticing that the car did not appear to be attached to a locomotive, he hurriedly gave chase and bravely jumped onto the car, finally stopping it in front of the Telecommunications Section gate. At this point, the guards also arrived one after another and used manpower to push the car back to its original position, tightening the handbrake. Old Man Zhang's responsible spirit ultimately prevented an accident at the station and preserved the people's property. The next day, his superiors commended him, and the trade union also called on everyone to learn from Old Man Zhang's responsible spirit, strengthen vigilance, oppose complacency, protect state property, and eliminate all accidents, large and small.

　　张永德奋勇救车
    五月五日夜间二点四十分，刮起一阵阵的暴风。停放在丰台检车段的一辆货车（五五○四○号），因手闸未上紧，竟被风刮得走动起来。往东为下坡道，所以车辆自行滑溜。速度逐渐加快，竟突过了段内三个道岔。此时看守的张永德老汉正巡逻至东门，发觉该车不像被机车牵挂的样子，即急忙追赶前去，奋不顾身地跃身登车，终于在电务段门前将车辆停了下来。这时纠察队员们也相继赶来，用人力将车推回原处，上紧了手闸。张老汉这种负责的精神，终于使车站避免了事故，保全了人民的财产。第二天上级表扬了他，工会方面也号召大家学习张老汉的负责精神，加强警惕，反对麻痹，保护国家的财产，消灭一切大小事故。
