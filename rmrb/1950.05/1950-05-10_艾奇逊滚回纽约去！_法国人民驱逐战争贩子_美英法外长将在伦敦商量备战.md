Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch: "Acheson, Go Back to New York!" French People Expel Warmongers; US, British, and French Foreign Ministers to Confer in London on War Preparations.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch: The French people are angrily protesting Acheson's arrival in France. A compilation of TASS Paris dispatches: On May 6th, the Standing Committee of the French "Association of Fighters for Freedom and Peace" issued a communique, calling on the French people to "turn Acheson's stay in Paris into a day of strong protest against new war preparations," and calling on people throughout France to intensify the peace signature campaign, hand over petitions for peace to Acheson, and tell him that the French people are determined not to participate in aggressive endeavors. When Acheson arrived in Paris on the 7th, although large numbers of police were deployed from the airport to the American embassy, slogans such as "Long Live Peace" were written everywhere. On this day, anti-Acheson protest demonstrations and protest rallies were held in Paris and throughout France. Speakers at the rallies emphasized that Acheson's arrival in France meant the intensification of war preparations. Residents of Paris flocked to visit the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, shouting: "We want peace!" "Acheson, go back to New York!"
　　Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch: The long-planned meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France has already begun with bilateral talks prior to the conference.
　　U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, along with his Republican advisor Cooper, flew to Paris on the 7th. On the same day, Acheson held meetings with senior U.S. officials in Europe: Ambassador-at-Large Jessup, Ambassador to France Bruce, Marshall Plan European Executor Harriman, Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs Perkins, and High Commissioner for Germany McCloy. On the 8th, Acheson began talks with French Foreign Minister Schuman. Acheson is scheduled to go to London on the 9th to hold talks with British Foreign Secretary Bevin; then, starting on the 11th, the three foreign ministers' meeting will be held in London. The supreme body of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, the Council of Foreign Ministers of the twelve nations, is also scheduled to hold its fourth meeting in London starting on the 15th, presided over by Acheson. According to a United Press London dispatch of April 24th, all four of these meetings "will aim to create a unified 'overall diplomacy' to carry out an 'overall cold war' as its main goal."
　　The US-British-French Foreign Ministers' meeting is being held in an atmosphere of pessimism and confusion within the imperialist bloc. A United Press London dispatch of May 2nd pointed out: "When the three foreign ministers begin their meeting, they will acknowledge that they are 'failing in the Cold War,' and they will review the world situation in which the Soviet Union has overwhelmingly prevailed for the past eight months." The New York Herald Tribune also said in a low key: "The primary responsibility of the foreign ministers is to give the countries they represent some clear guidance, confidence and hope in the current chaotic situation."

　　“艾奇逊滚回纽约去！”
    法国人民驱逐战争贩子
    美英法外长将在伦敦商量备战
    【新华社九日讯】法国人民愤怒抗议艾奇逊抵法。综合塔斯社巴黎消息：五月六日，法国“争自由和平战士协会”常务委员会发出公报，号召法国人民“把艾奇逊在巴黎逗留的日子，变成为反对新战争准备而提出强硬抗议的日子”，并号召法国各地人民加紧和平签名运动，把和平呼吁书交给艾奇逊，告诉他法国人民决心不参与侵略事业。当艾奇逊于七日到达巴黎时，虽然从机场到美国大使馆都布置了大队的警察，但是，到处都写着“和平万岁”的标语。在这一天，巴黎与法国各地都举行了反对艾奇逊来法的抗议示威和抗议大会。在会上发言的人们都强调指出：艾奇逊之来法，意味着备战工作的加紧进行。巴黎居民曾络绎不绝地去拜谒无名英雄墓，他们高呼：“我们要和平！”“艾奇逊滚回纽约去！”
    【新华社九日讯】准备已久的美、英、法三国外长会议，业已开始会前的双边会谈。
    美国国务卿艾奇逊，已于七日偕同其共和党顾问库泊尔飞抵巴黎。当日，艾奇逊曾与美国在欧高级官员：无任所大使耶塞普、驻法大使勃鲁斯、马歇尔计划欧洲执行人哈里曼、欧洲事务助理国务卿柏金斯、驻德高级专员麦克洛埃等举行会议。八日，艾奇逊已开始与法外长舒曼进行会谈。艾奇逊定于九日赴伦敦，与英外相贝文进行会谈；然后于十一日起在伦敦举行三外长会议。侵略性的北大西洋公约的最高机构十二国外长理事会，亦已定于十五日起在艾奇逊主持下在伦敦举行第四次会议。所有这四个会谈，据合众社伦敦四月二十四日电指出：“将以创立统一的‘总体外交’以进行‘总体冷战’为其主要目标。”
    美英法外长会议是在帝国主义集团充满悲观气氛与混乱的情绪下举行的。合众社伦敦五月二日电指出：“三外长开始其会议时，将承认他们‘正在冷战中失败’，他们将检讨八个月来压倒优势在于苏联一边的世界局势。”纽约先驱论坛报也低调地说：“外长们的主要责任，是在目前的混乱局面中给予他们所代表的国家以一些明确的指导，给予它们以信心与希望。”
