　　Vietnam's Struggle for Independence
    (Ding, Secretary of the Vietnam National United Front District Committee)
    Vietnam is the largest of the three countries that make up Indochina. It has a population of 20 million, compared to Cambodia's 4 million and Laos' 1 million.
    It is also the richest of the French colonies. The South (Cochinchina) produces rice and rubber, the Central region salt and fish, and the North (Tonkin) is rich in timber and minerals.
    The Vietnamese people have never ceased their struggle against their foreign masters during the more than eighty years of French colonial rule. Since the Second World War, the struggle has become even more intense. Although the colonialists implemented white terror, uprisings continued to occur throughout the country:
    October 1940, Bac Son (North)
    November 1940, South
    November 1940, Do Luong (Central)
    August 1941, Dinh Ca (North)
    These resistances were brutally suppressed in a sea of blood. But the patriotic war broke out. Nothing could stop it.
            National United Front
    In 1940, the French traitors in the West sold out France to the German fascists, while the French traitors in the East sold out Vietnam to the Japanese fascists. The Vietnamese people, under the dual oppression of France and Japan, engaged in the struggle more resolutely and methodically:
    In 1941, the National United Front was formed: this is the Viet Minh.
    The League for the Independence of Vietnam (also known as the Viet Minh) means the alliance for the independence of Vietnam. It is composed of all patriots, regardless of political affiliation, religious belief, social class, gender, and age.
    Its members are united in various national salvation associations, such as the Workers' National Salvation Association, the Peasants' National Salvation Association, the Women's National Salvation Association, the Youth National Salvation Association, the Children's National Salvation Association, and so on.
    The Viet Minh, learning from international experience—that it is impossible to defeat the oppressors without armed forces—took on the task of organizing armed guerrillas. Guerrilla warfare against the Japanese and French troops began in 1944. Soon, six provinces in Upper Tonkin were occupied. In this area, the initial steps of New Democracy were implemented: local governments were elected by the people, equality between men and women was practiced, and so on.
    The ranks of the guerrillas rapidly grew and became the People's Liberation Army (the National Defense Army).
    Viet Bac—the location of the Viet Minh—became a "sacred place" of national revolution. Patriots, male and female, old and young, secretly went to Viet Bac from all corners of the country to receive encouragement and instructions.
            August Revolution
    In March 1945, Japanese imperialism drove French imperialism out the door. The Viet Minh had foreseen this and was prepared to take advantage of it. Politically, it explained the contradictions between the imperialists and the inevitable end of these bandits to the people. Militarily, it launched a fierce propaganda campaign among the native soldiers in the French army and obtained a batch of weapons from their side.
    The prestige of the Viet Minh increased, and its organization developed very rapidly. In the middle of 1945, it already had five million members, and today it has reached twelve million.
            The order for a general uprising was issued
    In August 1945, Japanese imperialism was defeated, and the Vietnamese revolution achieved victory throughout the country.
    On September 2, 1945, President Ho Chi Minh announced the independence of Vietnam, the establishment of the Democratic Republic, and the formation of the People's Government. In this way, nearly a century of colonial oppression and thousands of years of feudal rule were swept away.
            Intervention by International Reactionaries
    The international reactionaries, led by U.S. imperialism, immediately attempted to stifle the young Republic of Vietnam.
    Under the orders of the Allied General Staff (headed by American MacArthur), and under the pretext of disarming the Japanese troops, British troops occupied the southern half of Vietnam, while Kuomintang troops occupied the northern half. The former helped the French colonialists launch a war of reconquest in the South. The latter facilitated the counter-revolutionary work of the Vietnamese reactionaries.
    In addition, Japanese imperialism and French imperialism left a disastrous legacy to the new Republic of Vietnam: a great famine. All the rice and grain were confiscated, so in the spring of 1945, more than two million people in the northern provinces were on the verge of starvation; and then there were droughts and floods!
    Thanks to the correctness of the Viet Minh's leadership policies and the enthusiasm of the people, not only was the famine avoided, but many new advances were also achieved, such as: a universally elected parliament, the formation of a people's army, the victory of the literacy campaign...
            French Colonialists Launch War
    As early as September 1945, the French colonialists, with the help of British and Japanese troops, launched a war in the South (Cochinchina).
    At that time, the Vietnamese people in general, and especially the people in the South, were not strongly organized militarily. Most of the guerrilla fighters were only armed with bamboo poles. The commander of the French colonial army, the famous General Leclerc, predicted that all of Vietnam could be reconquered in at most three months.
    Leclerc miscalculated, as everyone has seen.
    The colonialists waged war in the South and conducted diplomacy in the North, both at the same time. They attempted to buy time to strengthen the expeditionary force in order to launch a major strike.
    That is how the French government and the government of the Republic of Vietnam signed the March 6th agreement and the September 14th provisional agreement, which were soon torn up by it.
    On December 20, 1946, the French army launched a general offensive throughout Vietnam. This was an undeclared war. The French warlords wanted to re-enact Hitler's blitzkrieg tactics, attempting to wipe out Vietnam's patriotic forces in one fell swoop.
    On this point, the French colonialists miscalculated again. They will inevitably suffer the same fate as their Hitlerian predecessors.
            They are trapped in military difficulties
    After heroically resisting in Hanoi for two months, the Vietnamese forces, without losing a single soldier or gun, moved into the countryside.
    In the last three months of 1947, the French used naval, land, and air forces to encircle and annihilate the Vietnamese forces in Viet Bac. But they were rewarded with a great defeat, with 7,500 casualties.
    After this defeat, they limited themselves to smaller-scale wars.
    In 1948, even the most stubborn French warlords openly admitted that conquering Vietnam would require 500,000 French troops. However, to recruit, equip, and supply these troops and transport them to Vietnam was something that France, already extremely weakened and impoverished after the Second World War, could not afford.
    Researchers of colonial issues, such as Professor Chulas and others, admitted that the Vietnamese People's Army was already as strong as the French colonial army.
    American newspapers, such as the New York Herald Tribune, wrote: "The French expeditionary force in Indochina has exceeded 120,000 men (according to the French Colonial Minister Letourneau, it is 231,000 men), but today it has not made more progress than at the beginning of the war. The area occupied by the French army does not exceed 15 percent of the country."
    By the end of 1949, the French expeditionary force's casualties had reached about 100,000 soldiers.
    The French Chief of Staff, General Revers, planned to block the Vietnamese border but failed completely. The morale of the French army was very low, while the Vietnamese army was preparing to launch a general counter-offensive.
            ...Trapped in Political Difficulties
    Since there was no hope in the military, the French colonialists tried political tricks. They used Bao Dai to organize a puppet government to split the Vietnamese people.
    Bao Dai, a useless king in nightclubs, is a professional opportunist who has served as a running dog for the French, a running dog for the Japanese, and now has turned back to be a running dog for the French. He married the daughter of a Catholic landlord, is related by marriage to a French count, and grew up among the corrupt aristocracy in France, spending most of his time in the French countryside. This puppet is a friend of Chiang Kai-shek, and his ending will certainly be as shameful as that of the Chinese vampire.
    This Vietnamese Quisling is not only hated by the people but also denied by the former royal family. For example:
    In 1949, when General Revers arrived in Indochina, more than a thousand intellectuals in Saigon submitted a declaration opposing Bao Dai and supporting Ho Chi Minh.
    Bao Dai's grand-uncle, the old Prince Vinh-Tuy (transliteration), published a letter condemning Bao Dai as a traitor to the motherland. Afterwards, he left the French-occupied royal city of Hue and accepted the position of chairman of a branch of the National United Front.
    All people's organizations unanimously demanded that Bao Dai be punished for his great crime of treason.
    An American reporter asked an official of Bao Dai how many Vietnamese people sympathized with Bao Dai. The answer was: "The most generous estimate is one percent."
    The American newspaper mentioned above wrote: "Except for a very few people, all Vietnamese are against the French colonialists and Bao Dai, and the vast majority support the revolutionary government of Ho Chi Minh."
    Therefore, in politics as in the military, the French imperialists are stuck in a quagmire.
            ...Trapped in Economic Difficulties
    According to official figures, in 1949, the Vietnam War cost France 115 billion francs, which is four times higher than in the early stages of the war in 1946-47.
    Due to the crazy increase in war expenses, the French economy in Vietnam is completely bankrupt, as can be seen from the following figures:
        Pre-war Exports                                  1949 Exports
          Rice        1,500,000 tons                          90,000 tons
          Coal        1,500,000 tons                          40,000 tons
        Rubber        100,000 tons                              28,000 tons
        Other        900,000 tons                              42,000 tons
        Total        4,000,000 tons                          200,000 tons
    The Vietnam War is leading Marshallized France to bankruptcy. The New York Herald Tribune wrote:
    "Previously, Vietnam was a source of wealth for France; today, it is a source of debt for France."
            U.S. Intervention and Contradictions Among Bandits
    The position of French colonialism in Vietnam is like a person riding on the back of a tiger. Should he get off the tiger's back? He will be eaten. Should he not get off? He will also be eaten. In desperation, he turned to U.S. imperialism for help.
    The latter, without needing to be invited twice, immediately jumped at the opportunity because he wanted to use Vietnam as a "security belt" against communism.
    Immediately, sharp contradictions arose between the two gangs.
    U.S. imperialism said to its French counterpart:
    "Because I lent you dollars and arms, and because you are unable to defeat Vietnam, then, get lost, let me do it!"
    But French imperialism said to its "savior":
    "Hey! Sorry! You supply the arms, that's right. But I sacrificed the lives of hundreds of thousands of French youth, and I want to keep a part of the spoils."
    Please see the latest evidence of these contradictions:
    On March 1, 1950, Agence France-Presse declared: "The French government intends to maintain control over all aid given to Vietnam (the Bao Dai puppet)." On the same day, United Press reported the words of Truman's roving ambassador Jessup: "Complete independence for Vietnam cannot be guaranteed until French troops are withdrawn" (translated from foreign newspapers).
    This is America...kicking him in the back of the legs.
            America's "Fraud"
    According to a March 6, 1950 United Press report, Truman sent the French army in Vietnam: 60 new planes, maybe 120...the U.S. Seventh Fleet will be stationed in Saigon territorial waters...the U.S. will use Japanese soldiers to fight in Vietnam...Washington, at the request of the French government, will give Bao Dai $30 million to maintain until June...etc...
    But the same news agency wrote on March 1, 1950: "What the United States is doing in Vietnam now is: the biggest horse race gamble that the United States has not yet played in the Cold War. Even with American aid, the French cannot defeat the Communist guerrillas...
    Since 1946, Ho Chi Minh has been able to stop the French advance without any foreign aid...If he received even a small portion of what the United States gave to the French, he would be able to resist for many more years. If the Soviet Union came to his aid, he would create a situation that would be unimaginable for both the French and the Americans. ...The $30 million that the French are asking for Bao Dai is just a drop in the ocean...The Bao Dai government supported by the French is nascent, weak, and despised by the people..."
    Therefore, even American reactionary public opinion has criticized Truman's adventurism in Vietnam.
    Truman is a very bad gambler. He bet a huge amount of dollars and energy on Chiang Kai-shek, and as a result, he suffered a terrible defeat: he lost both money and face, and his inferior horse in China collapsed entirely. Revolutionary China was victoriously liberated.
    Without a doubt, Bao Dai and the French Expeditionary Force will also end up like Chiang Kai-shek, and Truman will fail in the horse race gamble in Vietnam as he did in China. But this time, the defeat will be even more painful for him, because he will be defeated by a small Vietnam.
            Vietnam Will Win
    The recognition of the Vietnamese Republican government by the Soviet Union, New China, and democratic countries has raised the enthusiasm of the heroic Vietnamese people to the highest level. The morale of the Vietnamese people is extremely high, and their courage is invincible. This recognition is a great political victory for Vietnam.
    The sympathy of the working people all over the world, the solidarity of the French people—who launched a broad movement against the "despicable war" in Vietnam—is a great spiritual victory for the Vietnamese people.
    "The Vietnamese people are prepared to fight for ten, fifteen, twenty years, or even longer, if necessary, to restore the independence of their country and the unification of their territory!" President Ho Chi Minh has declared. He also said: "The closer we get to victory, the more difficulties we encounter. But we are determined to overcome all difficulties and endure all sacrifices to achieve our goal: to drive out all invaders and liberate our motherland."
    When a nation has such persistent determination and unwavering confidence, the final victory is reliably guaranteed. Vietnam will win.
    Therefore, contrary to the idea of those international reactionaries, headed by the French and American reactionaries, who want to use Vietnam as a fence against communism in Southeast Asia, Vietnam will become a solid vanguard of the international anti-imperialist front in this part of the world.

### 越南为争取独立而斗争

　　越南为争取独立而斗争
    （越南国民联合会区委员会书记丁）
    越南是构成印度支那三个国家中最大的一个国家。它拥有二千万人口，柬埔寨为四百万，老挝为一百万。
    它也是法国殖民地中最富的一个。南部（交趾支那）出产大米和树胶，中部出盐及鱼，北部（东京）富于木材及矿。
    越南人民在八十余年法国殖民地统治下从未停止过他们对外国主人的斗争。从第二次世界大战以来，斗争更为剧烈了。虽然殖民者实施白色恐怖，暴动继续地在全国发生：
    一九四○年十月北山（北部）
    一九四○年十一月南部
    一九四○年十一月多梁（中部）
    一九四一年八月定价（北部）
    这些反抗被野蛮地在血海中压制下去了。但是爱国战争却爆发了。什么都不能抑止它。
            民族统一阵线
    一九四○年，在西方的法国卖国贼出卖了法国给德国法西斯而在东方的法国卖国贼将越南出卖给日本法西斯。越南人民处于法日两重压迫之下，更坚决地更有步骤地从事斗争：
    一九四一年，民族统一阵线组成了：这就是越盟。
    越南独立同盟（或称为越盟）意思就是争取越南独立的联盟。它由一切爱国者，不分政治倾向，宗教信仰，社会阶级，性别及年龄，所组成。
    它的盟员们是团结在各种救国会中，例如工人救国会，农民救国会，妇女救国会，青年救国会，儿童救国会等等。
    越盟由于国际经验——即没有武装力量不可能战胜压迫者的经验所获得的教训，就负起组织武装游击队的任务来。在一九四四年就开始了对日法军队的游击战争了。不久即占领了上北部的六个省份。这个区域中，实施了新民主主义的初步：由人民选举地方政府，实行男女平等，等等。
    游击队的队伍迅速地发展起来而成为人民解放军（卫国军）。
    越北——越盟所在地——成为一种民族革命的“圣地”了。爱国分子，男的女的，老的少的，由全国各角落秘密地前赴越北，接受鼓励及指示。
            八月革命
    一九四五年三月，日本帝国主义把法帝国主义赶出了大门。越盟早已预见到这一件事是准备加以利用。政治上，它将帝国主义之间的矛盾和这些匪徒不可避免的结局解释给人民知道。军事上，它在法国军队中的土著士兵中间展开猛烈的宣传而由他们那边获得了一批武器。
    越盟的声望增高了，它的组织很迅速地发展了。一九四五年中间，它已有五百万盟员，今日已达一千二百万。
            准备总暴动的命令发出了
    一九四五年八月，日本帝国主义战败，越南革命在全国获得了胜利。
    一九四五年九月二日，胡志明主席宣布了越南独立，民主共和国的建立和人民政府的成立。这样，近乎一世纪的殖民地压迫和几千年来的封建统治一扫而光了。
            国际反动派的干涉
    由美帝国主义领导的国际反动派马上企图窒息年青的越南共和国。
    在盟军参谋部（由美国麦克阿瑟做首长）的命令之下，并以解除日本军队的武装为借口，英国军队占领了越南南半部分，而国民党军队占领了北半部。前者帮助了法国殖民主义者在南部发动重新征服的战争。后者则便利了越南反动派从事反革命的工作。
    另外，日本帝国主义和法国帝国主义给新越南共和国留下灾难性的遗产：大饥荒。全部的米粮给他们征收了去，因此，一九四五年春季，北方各省二百多万人濒于饿死；而后又是旱灾又是水灾！
    赖于越盟领导上的政策的正确及人民的热忱，不惟饥荒避免了，而且完成了许多新的进步，例如：一个普选出来的议会，一支人民军队的组成，消灭文盲运动的胜利……
            法国殖民者发动战争
    即在一九四五年九月，法国殖民主义者由于英日军队的帮助，在南部（交趾支那）发动了战争。
    那时候，越南人民一般地，特别是南部人民在军事上组织不强。大部分游击战士只以竹竿为武器，法国殖民地军队的司令，著名的勒克莱将军曾预言，最多三个月，全部越南即可重新征服。
    勒克莱算错了，一如大家所见到的。
    殖民主义者在南部进行战争而在北部进行外交，两者并进。他们企图争取时间，加强远征军力量以便进行一次重大的打击。
    就是这样，法国政府与越南共和国政府签订了三月六日的条约及九月十四日的临时协定，这些文件不久以后就被它撕毁了。
    一九四六年十二月二十日，法国军队在全部越南发动了总攻击。这是个不宣而战的战争，法国军阀们想再版一下希特勒的闪电战术，企图一击即把越南的爱国武力消灭。
    在这一点上，法国殖民主义者又算错了。他们必将受到他们希特勒先进者同样的命运。
            他们陷于军事困难中
    越南武力在河内英勇地抵抗了二个月后，并未丧失一兵一枪，转入了农村。
    一九四七年最后三个月，法国人曾以海陆空军力量来包围并消灭越北的越南武力。但是他们获得的酬报是一个极大的失败，七千五百人的死伤。
    这次失败后，他们只限于比较小规模的战争了。
    一九四八年，法国最顽固的军阀也公开地承认，要征服越南，需要五十万法国军队。但是，要征召、装备、给养这些兵员而把他们运到越南来，这不是经过二次世界大战而已极为衰弱及贫穷的法国所能负担得起的。
    对于殖民地问题有研究的人，例如徐拉斯教授以及其他的人承认：越南人民军已经与法国殖民地军队一样强大了。
    美国报纸，例如纽约先锋论坛报曾写道：在印度支那的法国远征军已超过十二万人（根据法国殖民地部长勒都尔诺，则为二十三万一千人），但今天，它并不比战争初期更有所进展。法国军队所占领的地区并不超过全国百分之十五。
    到一九四九年年底，法国远征军死伤的损失已经达到十万名士兵左右。
    法军参谋长雷范尔将军计划封锁越南边境，完全失败了。法国军队的士气十分低落，至于越南军队则准备发动一个总反攻。
            ……陷于政治上的困难
    军队方面既然没有希望，法国殖民主义者就试试政治把戏了。他们利用保大来组织一个傀儡政府以分裂越南人民。
    保大，夜总会里的废王，是职业性的看风驶舵的人，他轮流地当过法国人的走狗，日本人的走狗，现在又回头转来当法国人的走狗了。他同一个天主教大地主的女儿结婚，与一个法国伯爵是连襟，在法国腐化的贵族中长大，大部分时间生活在法国的水乡，这个傀儡是蒋介石的朋友，他的结局一定也将与中国的吸血鬼同样可耻。
    这个越南吉斯林，不但为人民所憎恨，且被前皇室所否认。例如：
    一九四九年当雷范尔将军抵达印度支那时，西贡一千多名的知识分子曾递送一个宣言，反对保大，拥护胡志明。
    保大的叔祖，永裕（译音）老亲王发表过一封信斥责保大是祖国卖国贼。之后他离开了法国人所占领的皇城——顺化，接受了民族统一阵线一个支部的主席的职位。
    各人民团体一致地要求惩处保大叛国之大罪。
    一个美国记者曾问过保大一个官吏，有多少越南人同情保大的？回答是：最慷慨的估计是百分之一。
    上面提及那家美国报纸曾写道：除去极少数人外，所有的越南人都是反对法国殖民主义者和保大的，绝大部分是拥护胡志明的革命政府的。
    因此，政治上也同军事上一样，法帝国主义者是陷在泥沼中。
            ……陷在经济困难中
    官方数字，一九四九年，越南战争使法国付出一千一百五十亿法郎，即是说，比一九四六——七年战争初期高了四倍。
    由于战争费用疯狂地高涨，法国在越南的经济就整个地破产，下列数字可见一斑：
        战前输出                                  一九四九年输出
          米        一、五○○、○○○吨          九○、○○○吨
          煤        一、五○○、○○○吨          四○、○○○吨
        树胶        一○○、○○○吨              二八、○○○吨
        其他        九○○、○○○吨              四二、○○○吨
        合计        四、○○○、○○○吨        二○○、○○○吨
    越南战争引导马歇尔化了的法国走向破产。纽约先锋论坛报写道：
    “以前，越南是法国财富的一个来源，今天，它是法国债务的一个来源了。”
            美国的干涉与盗匪之间的矛盾
    法国殖民主义在越南的地位好像一个人骑在虎背上。他下虎背罢？他将被吃掉。不下罢？他也将被吃掉。失望之余，他就求助于美帝国主义了。
    后者，不用邀请两次，马上跳起来抓着这个机会，因为他想将越南做为一条反共的“安全带”。
    立刻，两股匪帮中间发生了尖锐的矛盾。
    美帝国主义对他的法国同道说：
    “因为我借出了美元和军火，因为你没有能力打越南，那末，滚你的蛋，由我来吧！”
    但是法国帝国主义对他的“救主”说：
    “喂！对不起！你供给军火，不错。可是我牺牲了几十万法国青年的生命，我要留一部分赃物的。”
    请看这些矛盾最近的证据：
    一九五○年三月一日，法国新闻社宣称：“法国政府对于给予越南（保大傀儡）的一切援助，意欲保持控制权”。而同日，合众社报道了杜鲁门的巡回大使耶塞普的话：“在法国军队未撤退之前，越南完全独立是不能有所保证的”（由国外报纸转译）。
    这是美国……在抽他的后脚。
            美国的“欺诈”
    据一九五○年三月六日合众社消息，杜鲁门送给越南的法国军队：六十架新飞机，也许是一百二十架……美国第七舰队将驻在西贡领水……美国将利用日兵来打越南……华盛顿应法政府之要求，将予保大三千万美元俾得维持到六月……等等……
    但是同一通讯社于一九五○年三月一日写道：“美国目前在越南所做的是：美国在冷战中至今尚未玩过的赛马大赌博。法国人即使有了美国的援助也是无法战胜共产党游击队的……
    自一九四六年起，胡志明没有任何外国援助而能阻止了法军的前进……假如他获得，美国给予法国人的仅仅一小部分，他将更能抵抗好几年。假如苏联来援助他，他将造成一种形势，这种形势，对于法国人和美国人都是不可想像的。……法国人为保大要求的三千万美元只是大海中一滴水而已……法国人所支持的保大政府是新生的，软弱而为人民所轻视的……”
    因此，甚至美国的反动舆论也斥责了杜鲁门对越南的冒险行为。
    杜鲁门是个很坏的赌手，他曾以巨大数目的美元及力气在蒋介石身上下赌注，而结果，他受到的是可怕的失败：他，失去了本钱和面子，他在中国的那匹劣马却整个儿垮台，革命的中国胜利地解放了。
    毫无疑问，保大和法国远征军也将如蒋介石一样完蛋的，而杜鲁门在越南将如在中国一样要在赛马赌博中失败的。但是，这一次，失败对他将更为痛苦，因为他将是给一个小小越南打败了。
            越南将获得胜利
    苏联，新中国及民主国家承认越南共和政府提高了英勇的越南人民的热忱至最高的程度，越南人民的民气极高，勇气是不可制服的，这承认对越南是一个政治上的大胜利。
    全世界劳动人民的同情，法国人民的团结——他们发动了一个反对越南“卑鄙战争”的广泛运动，对越南人是个精神上的大胜利。
    “越南人民为了恢复他们国家的独立和国土的统一，准备斗争十年，十五年，二十年甚至更久，假如有此必要的话！”胡志明主席曾如此宣布。他又说：“我们越接近胜利，我们遭遇到的困难越多。但是我们决心克服一切困难，承受一切牺牲以达到我们的目的：驱逐一切侵略者和解放我们祖国。”
    一国人民有这样的坚持的决心，不可动摇的信心，就是最后胜利的可靠的保证。越南将获得胜利。
    因此，和那些以法美反动派为首的国际反动派想把越南作为东南亚的一个反共的篱笆的想法相反，越南将成为这部分世界的国际反帝阵线的坚固的前卫。
