　　China Native Produce Company Decides on Main Tasks:
　　Organize National Native Produce Exchange
　　[By Our Correspondent] What are the main tasks of the China Native Produce Company? This question was decided at the National Native Produce Conference convened by the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government in April. The tasks are: to purchase farmers' by-products to support farmers' sideline production, improve farmers' lives, and organize and promote the national domestic sales and exchange of native produce in a planned way; and to engage in a portion of agency purchase business in areas where other specialized companies have not yet established institutions. In terms of operation, it is determined that native products that are industrial raw materials should mainly supply domestic industrial needs. Those that are daily consumer goods should strive to be exported to earn foreign exchange.
　　The conference proposed that promotion should be put in second place in the future. Because continuous purchasing is necessary to promote farmers' production, the crucial key is whether the promotion work can be carried out; otherwise, the funds will be increasingly accumulated due to large-scale purchases, which will greatly affect the development of the business. Therefore, the conference also stipulated that local native produce companies, in addition to conducting detailed investigations and research on the promotion business of local native products, should also pay attention to understanding the needs of local people for native products from other regions, so as to do a good job in the mutual adjustment of national native products. In terms of operating methods, the conference proposed to resolutely overcome bureaucratic work styles and change all methods that do not meet the requirements of the masses.
　　The types and scope of operation are temporarily divided into nine categories: native products, mountain goods, handicrafts, minerals, meat, aquatic products, fruits, medicinal materials, and other categories.
　　In order to concentrate and purchase the vast and scattered rural native products and distribute and adjust them, the conference believes that it is necessary to rely on cooperatives to carry out the work, and to widely and earnestly carry out contract business, adhering to the principle of "only criticism, no split," and closely combining with the cooperatives. At the same time, attention must also be paid to organizing and leading private merchants to engage in business, so as to promote the exchange of native products.
　　In order to ensure the implementation of the above tasks, the China Native Produce Company has decided to establish six administrative region companies in East China, Central South, Northeast, Northwest, and Inner Mongolia. Provincial companies will be established in the provinces of Hebei, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, and Pingyuan. Branch companies or temporary purchasing and sales institutions will be established in the concentration and distribution centers of major native products and in areas with convenient transportation.

　　中国土产公司主要任务已经决定
    组织全国土产交流
    【本报讯】中国土产公司的主要任务是什么？这一问题，在中央人民政府贸易部四月召开的全国土产会议上已有决定，就是：收购农民副产品，以扶助农民的副业生产，改善农民生活，有计划的组织推动全国土产内销交流工作；在其它专业公司未设机构的地区，经营一部分代购业务。在经营上确定凡属于工业生产原料的土产品，主要供应国内工业需要。属于日常消费品的，则应当争取输出换取外汇。
    会议提出今后要把推销放在第二位。因为要做到不断的收购，才能促进农民的生产，重要的关键却在推销工作是否能展开，否则将使资金因大量收购而积压愈多，影响业务的开展甚巨。因此会议又规定各地土产公司，除详细调查研究本地土产的推销业务外，并要注意了解本地群众对其他各地土产的需要情况，以便做好全国土产的互相调剂。在经营方式方法上，会议提出要坚决克服官僚主义作风，应改变一切不适合群众要求的办法。
    经营种类与范围暂分九类：计土产、山货、手工业、矿产、肉类、水产、水果、药材，其他等类。
    为要把广大、分散农村的土产品，集中收购起来，分散调剂下去，会议认为必须依靠合作社进行工作，并广泛认真的开展合同业务，本“只许检讨，不许分裂”的原则，与合作社紧密结合。同时亦须注意组织带动私商进行经营。以促进土产交流。
    为保证上述任务之执行，中国土产公司确定设华东、中南、东北、西北、内蒙等六行政区区公司。在河北、山西、河南、山东、平原等各省设省公司。并在主要土产之集中集散地，及交通运输便利之地区，设立支公司，或临时之购售机构。
