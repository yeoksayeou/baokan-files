　　Li Jishen Condemns US Imperialism for Releasing Japanese War Criminals Without Authorization
    [Xinhua News Agency] Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, issued the following statement on the 16th regarding MacArthur's unauthorized release of Japanese war criminals:

    MacArthur, based on a one-sided so-called "parole" method, has arbitrarily released Japanese war criminals convicted by the Far East Military Tribunal in batches ahead of schedule. The Soviet government has lodged a protest with the US government regarding this illegal and sinful action, and Zhou Enlai, Premier and Foreign Minister of our Central People's Government, also issued a solemn statement on the 15th. In the notes and statements of the two countries, it was pointed out that MacArthur's actions violated the basic principles and norms of international law, violated the solemn judgment of the Far East International Military Tribunal, and exceeded the authority that the Far Eastern Commission had granted to the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces. At the same time, this arrogant behavior is bound to seriously undermine the Chinese people's fundamental right to sanction Japanese war criminals, which was earned through eight years of bloody war, and undermine the Chinese people's fundamental interests in preventing the resurgence of Japanese fascist aggressive forces. Therefore, the Chinese and Soviet governments have both demanded that the US government immediately take steps to revoke MacArthur's illegal Fifth Directive and take responsibility for correcting this illegal and ultra vires behavior.

    I believe that the solemn statements and firm protests of the Chinese and Soviet governments are fully in line with the inner demands of peace-loving and justice-upholding people around the world. In particular, we Chinese people, since the "September 18th" Incident, after eight years of arduous and bloody war, still vividly remember the killing and poisoning by the Japanese aggressive forces, and will never allow those old war criminals to escape justice, nor will we allow the American warlords to use those criminals again to engage in new war deployments.

    The US occupation authorities' illegal measures in Japan have repeatedly aroused protests and hatred from the Chinese people in recent years. This release of Japanese war criminals is only one of his countless crimes. Through MacArthur, the United States is actively supporting the revival of Japanese militarist forces, stepping up the construction of naval and air force bases, and brutally suppressing the rise of the Japanese people's democratic movement. On the other hand, it is sending Japanese war criminals to assist the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary forces in Taiwan to oppose the Chinese people. These towering crimes of the warmongers have been fully exposed to the peace-loving people of the world. We must strengthen the power of the peace movement to expose these crimes, resist these crimes, and eliminate these crimes.

    I firmly believe that with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance as the backbone, and the united hands of nearly 700 million working people, coupled with the great unity of peace-loving people all over the world, Japanese war criminals will have nowhere to escape, and new warmongers will not be able to carry out their conspiracies. We have enough power to extinguish all flames of aggressive war.

　　不容战犯逍遥法外
　　李济深斥美帝擅释日战犯
    【新华社讯】中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深对于麦克阿瑟擅自释放日本战争罪犯事于十六日发表下列谈话：
    麦克阿瑟根据片面的所谓“假释”办法，擅自将经过远东军事法庭判决的日本战犯，分批提前予以释放。对于这种非法的罪恶行动，苏联政府曾向美国政府提出照会，我中央人民政府周兼外长亦于十五日发表了严正的声明。在两国的照会和声明中，先后分别指出麦克阿瑟这种行动是违背国际公法的基本原则和常规，违背远东国际军事法庭庄严的判决，并且是超越了远东委员会所赋予盟军统帅应有的权限，同时，这种狂妄行为，必然严重损害中国人民以八年血战换来的制裁日本战犯的基本权利，损害中国人民防止日本法西斯侵略势力复兴的基本利益。因此，中苏两国政府，都同样要求美国政府立即设法撤销麦克阿瑟非法的第五号指令，负责纠正这种违法越权的行为。
    我认为中苏两国政府严正的声明和坚决的抗议，是完全符合全世界爱好和平维护正义的人民的内心要求的。尤其是我们中国人民，自“九·一八”事变以来，中间经过八年艰苦的血战，对于日本侵略势力的残杀荼毒，至今记忆犹新，决不容许那些老牌的战争罪犯，逍遥法外，更不容许美国军阀利用那些罪犯们，再来作从事新战争的布署。
    美国占领当局，在日本的一切非法措施，近年来已屡次引起中国人民的抗议和憎恨，这一次释放日本战犯，不过是他的无数罪行中之一。美国经过麦克阿瑟之手，一方面积极扶持日本军国主义势力的复活，加紧建筑海空军基地，严酷地镇压日本人民民主运动的抬头；一方面派遣日本战犯协助台湾蒋介石残余反动势力，来与中国人民为敌。这种战争贩子的滔天罪行，已经在全世界爱好和平的人民面前暴露得十分清楚。我们必须加强和平运动的力量，来揭发这些罪行，抵制这些罪行，消灭这些罪行。
    我深信以中苏友好同盟互助条约为骨干，将近七万万劳动人民的携手团结，再加上全世界爱好和平人民的大团结，日本战犯将无处逃避，新的战争贩子将无法施其阴谋诡计。一切侵略战争的火焰，我们都有足够的力量可以加以扑灭。
