A Trip to Singapore
By Ya Lalin, translated by Wu Songqiujie

The first thing that strikes a visitor to Singapore is the sight of many people in military uniforms among the crowds on the city streets, speaking various languages. You can see all kinds of troops from the army, navy, and air force. British materials tell us that the Singapore naval base is one of the largest in the British Empire—"the most fortified" British stronghold, with naval and air force bases.

The founders of Singapore clearly sought to establish a metropolis that would amaze and impress passing tourists, thereby inspiring in them awe of the power of the British Empire. For example, you get this impression from the Victoria Memorial Hall, whose magnificent building is top-heavy with a dark, rectangular upper structure, reminiscent of a fire lookout tower. The monumental buildings on the embankment and in the city center give you an unpleasant and depressing feeling. The city hall, supreme court, bank buildings, and other scores of ugly large buildings give you the same impression. The architecture of the entire city center and embankment is so discordant with the magnificent tropical scenery.

The streets of the city center are very clean. Dozens of workers take care of the trees along these grand avenues. There are many police in downtown Singapore, and British police often control and supervise the public and private lives of residents. The extent to which they are hated can be seen from the barbed wire around the Singapore Police Station, which looks like a fortress prepared to resist besieging armies.

The British ruling class sees Singapore as their outpost in Southeast Asia. The headquarters of the British colonial administrative staff in this part of the world—the British High Commission—is stationed here. According to a decree passed in 1948, citizens of Singapore, the colonial area, and the entire Malaya must register at the police station, provide their fingerprints on application forms and supporting documents, and then receive a certificate. Violators are subject to three years imprisonment or a fine of up to 10,000 Singapore dollars.

Here is a scene that can be seen on St. Andrews Street any day: in front of a huge building surrounded by barbed wire stands a long line. Although it is still early—only the rising sun illuminates the somber faces of the crowd—the line is already at least three hundred people long. These citizens have been ordered by the police to come and provide their fingerprints. For most, the long wait means loss of working hours, and therefore loss of income. Some people, dressed better than most, gather at the entrance. They secretly give the officers on duty small bribes to avoid waiting too long in line.

Although outwardly orderly, this city is not peaceful. The prisons are already overflowing. An incautious word, a slight expression of sympathy for the guerrillas operating in Malaya, or even just holding progressive views, is enough to get him arrested. In fact, in Singapore, arresting people is not a topic of loud discussion; people only whisper about it secretly. You rarely see prisoners being escorted through the streets; arrests are carried out at night. The *Malaya Tribune*, published in Singapore, commented on the draft budgets for Malaya and Singapore in 1950 in its November 4, 1949, issue, pointing out the fact that more than two and a half million Singapore dollars, or approximately the same amount as that used for education, had been allocated for the construction and maintenance of prisons.

Social disparities are very evident in this city. Everywhere you go you see the stark contrast between the poor and the rich: absolute authority and complete disenfranchisement, luxurious villas and filthy slums. Singapore's military and civil officials indulge in extravagance and debauchery. British families usually have three to five, and sometimes twelve, servants. Such luxury is easily explained: the cheapest commodity in Singapore is human labor.

British colonial officials and merchants do not live in the city, but in magnificent villas in the suburbs. The areas with the best scenery in the suburbs are reserved for them; here, British residents have their tree-lined avenues and paths, shady woods that shield the sun, magnificent ponds and swimming pools, and tennis courts. Outside each villa stands a "No Trespassing" sign.

After looking around this area, we return to the city center. Our purpose is to visit the Chinese quarter, where 70 percent of Singapore's 700,000 residents live. We hailed a car and asked him to drive there. The driver was quite surprised, because Europeans rarely travel in that direction. The British avoid going to those places.

After a ten-minute drive, we arrived in Singapore's Chinese quarter. The miserable conditions one sees would horrify the most seasoned traveler. The narrow and filthy streets are hot, and the suffocating stench emanating from the many cheap restaurants makes the air heavy. In front of the restaurants, dozens of children rummage through the dirt and garbage in search of something to eat. Their emaciated bodies are covered with sores and scars.

The huts of the Chinese are miserably crammed together, each bearing signs of poverty and destitution.

Through the open doorways, one can glimpse women in tattered clothes busy with housework, staring at us with wary and unfriendly eyes, clearly mistaking us for British.

We spoke to a Chinese woman—the wife of a dockworker. Her family is mired in terrible poverty, and the most pressing question is how to feed the children.

"How much does your husband earn?"

"Thirty to thirty-five Singapore dollars a month."

We tried to calculate the actual value of this amount, remembering that a small bowl of rice sells for about one dollar.

The conversation took place shortly after the People's Republic of China was declared in Beijing. The woman said:

"October 1st is truly a great festival for us, the greatest day I have ever known."

Because of fear of police punishment, the Chinese in Singapore did not dare to openly express their joy that day, but during the Double Ten Festival, thousands of five-star red flags appeared in Chinese residential areas, even in the darkest alleys and street corners. People congratulated each other. Separated from their homeland, the Chinese in Singapore sincerely and joyfully welcomed the news of their homeland's people defeating the oppressors of past generations.

We often heard these words: "The establishment of the People's Republic of China makes us here feel that our lives seem to have become freer and brighter. We know that behind us now there is a strong people's country, with the power to protect her overseas Chinese."

The people of Singapore are extremely resentful of the local authorities' open support for Kuomintang escapees from China. The British welcomed them with open arms, treating them as honored guests. The fleeing Kuomintang people filled the local hotels, renting luxurious rooms at a daily rent equal to a worker's monthly wage. The Chinese in Singapore hate and despise these fugitives. The hotels where they live are called "the residences of stray dogs."

During the days when ships from Hong Kong were anchored in the port of Singapore, you could hear many jokes and anecdotes here. The port certainly became lively at these times. Chinese and Malays gathered here to see the imported ships, witnessing firsthand the panic of the Kuomintang bandits who swarmed from China. When these Kuomintang escapees came ashore with heavy luggage, they were mocked and ridiculed.

British officials watched them with undisguised fear. The impact of the enormous development of the Chinese revolution, from the increasingly high anti-British guerrilla movement in Malaya, spread to Singapore. This movement terrifies the colonial rulers. The war against the guerrillas they call "bandits" is the most urgent topic of discussion among the British in Singapore. In the morning, as soon as they wake up, they rush to pick up the newspaper and read the news from Malaya. What's the news there? Have the guerrillas appeared on the other side of the Strait?

In October 1949, Singapore newspapers boasted that in the first nine months of 1949, British troops had killed more than 800 "bandits." September was the best month, with more than 100 "bandits" killed. However, the definition of the words "British troops" should be made more precise. The troops sent to attack the Malayan guerrillas are not only British, but also foreign mercenaries recruited by Britain from all over the world. Among them are the Nepalese Gurkha troops recruited under the British-Nepalese agreement, former German Nazi stormtroopers, and cannibals recruited from islands in the Indian Ocean.

However, all this cannot stop the Malayan guerrilla movement, which is expanding and threatening Singapore itself. According to statistics on the activities of the Malayan guerrillas published by the *Malaya Tribune* on November 10, 1949, the guerrillas derailed 159 trains in one year; attacked railway stations 47 times, destroyed two bridges, removed rails at dozens of different locations, and so on.

In a small restaurant across from a large movie theater, we spoke with a city official who said that the outside world knows very little about the true scale of the Malayan People's Guerrilla Movement. In fact, it has become a big problem for the British.

"If the British lose Malaya and Singapore, what colonial power will they have left in Southeast Asia?" he asked; at the same time, from the expression on his face, it could be seen that he was probably saying what he had heard.

British residents are indeed trembling for Singapore.

We had more than one opportunity to talk to local British residents about Singapore. And, while they tried to convince themselves, and convince us, that Singapore would always be a reliable outpost guarding the British colonies in Southeast Asia, we could almost always see an expression of hope and fear intertwined on their faces. However, they also understood that Singapore is located in the heart of "turbulent Asia" and is easily overwhelmed by the surging tide of the national liberation movement.

　　新加坡记游
    亚拉林著　吴松秋节译
    首先引起到新加坡的访问者注目的，是挤满在这城市的街道上的讲着各种语言的人群里有很多穿军服的。你可以看到有海陆空军各种部队。英国的材料告诉我们新加坡海军基地是大英帝国最大的基地之一——“世界上最强固的”英国要塞，海军和空军基地。
    新加坡城的创建者显然是力图建立一个足以令过往游客惊叹折服的都会，借以引起他们对大不列颠帝国权力的敬畏。例如，你从维多利亚纪念堂便得到此种印象，那宏伟的大厦头重脚轻地树上一幢幽暗的长方形的上层建筑，使人联想到一座望火塔。堤岸的纪念性建筑物和市中心区会给你以一种不快和抑闷不堪的感觉。市政府，最高法院和银行的建筑以及其它的成打的丑陋的大建筑物同样也会给你这种印象。整个市中心区和堤岸的建筑和富丽的热带风光是那样地不相调和。
    市中心的街道非常洁静。数十个工人照顾着这些华贵大街两旁的树木。在新加坡的市中心有许多警察，英国警察经常同时管制和监督着居民的公私生活。他们被憎恨的程度可由新加坡警察局周围的铁丝网看出来，它们好像是准备抵抗围攻军队的堡垒。
    英国统治阶级把新加坡看作他们在东南亚的前哨。在这里驻扎着英国在地球这一角上的殖民地行政参谋总部——英国总专员署。根据一九四八年通过的一项法令，新加坡市区、殖民区以及整个马来亚的公民，必要去警察局登记，在申请表和证明文件上按上他们的指印后就发给他们证明文件，违者处以三年徒刑或高至一万新币的罚款。
    这里是一幅任何一天都可以在圣安都斯大街上看到的景象：在一个环绕着铁丝网的巨大建筑的前面站着一排长长的行列。虽然天还很早——只有初升的阳光在照射着脸色阴暗的人群——而这行列至少已有三百人了。这些市民是警察厅命令他们来按指纹的。对大多数人来说，长时间的等待，意味着工作时间的损失，而因此也就是收入的损失。比大多数人穿得好的一些人聚集在入口处。他们暗地里给值勤的警官一些小贿赂为的是避免在排队中等待太久。
    虽然表面上是有秩序的，这个城市并不是宁静的。监狱里已挤不下了。不谨慎讲句话，对在马来亚活动的游击队稍微表示同情，或者仅仅抱着进步的观点，都足使他被捕。实在的，在新加坡，捕人并不是个高声谈论的题目，人们只是偷偷耳语着。你很少看到被押送的犯人从大街上走过；逮捕都是在夜间举行的。新加坡出版的《马来亚论坛报》在一九四九年十一月四日的报上评论马来亚和新加坡一九五○年预算草案时，指出此一事实：拨给建造和维持监狱的款项有二百五十万以上新加坡币，或者约相等于用于教育的经费。
    在这个城市里社会悬殊是很显明的。每到一个地方你都能看到穷与富的难堪的对照：绝对的权威和完全被剥夺参政权，奢华的别墅和污秽的贫民窟。新加坡的军事的和民政的官吏耽溺于骄奢淫佚。通常英国人的家庭总有三个到五个而且有时候有十二个仆役。这样的奢侈是很容易来解释的：在新加坡最便宜的商品是人的劳力。
    英国的殖民官员和商人并不住在城里，而是住在市郊的壮丽的别墅里。近郊的风景最好的地区是留给他们的；在这里英国的居民有他们的林荫大道和小路，可以遮住阳光的成荫的林木，华美的池塘和游泳池以及网球场。在每座别墅之外都立着“禁止通行”的牌子。
    在环视了这个区域之后我们回到城市的中心。我们的目的是访问中国人住区，那里居住着新加坡的七十万居民中的百分之七十。我们叫了一辆汽车，请他开到那里去。司机颇为吃惊，因为欧洲人很少朝那个方向去旅行。英国人避开去那些地方。
    经十分钟的行驶我们就到了新加坡的中国人住区。使人看到的凄惨状况会使最习惯的旅行者惊恐。狭窄而污秽的街道是炎热的，从许多便宜的饭铺里发散出来的窒息的臭味使空气变得沉浊不堪。在饭铺前面几十个小孩钻在脏土和垃圾里去寻找些东西来吃。他们瘦弱的身体上都是疮疤和伤痕。
    华侨的小屋子凄惨地挤在一堆，每一间都带着穷困贫乏的迹象。
    从敞开的门洞里可以窥见衣服褴褛的妇女们正忙于家务，她们以警戒和不友善的眼光盯着我们，显然的是把我们当作了英国人。
    我们和一个中国女人——一个码头工人的妻子谈话。她家里正陷于可怖的贫困，最迫切的问题是如何养活那些孩子。
    “你丈夫赚多少钱？”
    “每个月三十至三十五元新币。”
    我们试图计算这个数目的实际价值，记起了一小碗米饭就卖一元左右。
    谈话的时间是在中华人民共和国在北京宣布成立后不久。这位女人说：
    “十月一日对我们真是一个大节日，这是我所知道的最伟大的日子了”。
    因为害怕警察的刑罚，新加坡的华侨不敢公开的在那天表露他们的欢欣，但是在双十节在华侨住宅区出现了数千面五星红旗，甚至在最阴暗的胡同和街口。人们互相恭贺道喜。与他们祖国相隔离的新加坡华侨，真诚喜悦地迎接了祖国人民战胜历代压迫者们的信息。
    我们时常听见这几句话：“中华人民共和国的成立，使我们在这里也感觉到我们的生活似乎变得自由和光明些。我们知道现在我们的后面有着一个强大的人民的国家，有力量保护她的海外侨民”。
    新加坡的人民对本市当局给予从中国来的国民党逃亡者的公开支持极其愤恨。英国人伸开双手欢迎他们，把他们当作上宾招待。逃亡的国民党人挤满了当地的旅馆，租用着华丽的房间，每天的租金等于一个工人一个月的工资。新加坡的华侨憎恨并鄙视这些亡命之徒。他们居住的旅馆被大家称为“丧家之犬的住所”。
    在由香港驶来的船只碇舶在新加坡港口的时日，你可以在这儿听到许许多多的笑话和趣闻。每逢这些时会，港口确乎是变得生动了。中国人和马来人都汇聚到这里来看望进口的船只，他们亲眼看到那些由中国蜂涌而来的国民党匪徒们的仓惶情景。当这些国民党的逃亡者们带着笨重的行李包上岸时，他们受到嘲弄和揶揄。
    英国的官员们以无法掩饰的惊惧眼光看着他们。中国革命形势的巨大发展的影响，由反英游击运动日益高涨的马来亚，传到了新加坡。这运动使殖民统治者们恐怖。反对他们所称为“土匪”的游击队之战争是在新加坡的英国人间最急迫的谈论问题。早晨，当他们一醒来便急忙拿起报纸翻阅马来亚方面的新闻。那边的消息怎么样？游击队已否在海峡的彼岸出现？
    一九四九年十月新加坡的报纸吹牛说：在一九四九年前九个月内，英国军队业已击毙“土匪”八百人以上，九月份的成绩最佳，是月击毙的“土匪”当在百名以上。然而，“英国军队”这几个字的定义，倒是应该弄得更精确一点的。派来攻击马来亚游击队的军队，不仅仅是英国人，同时也包括英国在世界各地所招募来的外籍雇佣兵。其中有根据英国与尼泊尔协定而募集的尼泊尔高喀部队，有从前的德国纳粹冲锋队，由从印度洋中的岛屿上募来的吃人生番。
    然而，所有这一切都无法阻遏马来亚的游击运动，它正日益扩展，并且威胁到新加坡本身。据一九四九年十一月十日《马来亚论坛报》所公布的关于马来亚游击队活动的统计，游击队在一年中，曾使一五九列火车出轨；袭击火车站四十七次，炸毁了两座桥梁，在数十处不同地点拨去路轨，等等。
    在一家大电影院对面的一个小饭馆里，我们与一个市政府官吏谈话，他说，外界对马来亚人民游击运动的真正规模知道得很少。事实上，它已成为英国人的一个大问题了。
    “假如英国人失去马来亚和新加坡，他们在东南亚的殖民权势还剩下什么呢？”他这样问；同时，由他说这话的神情，可以看出很可能他是在说他所曾听到的。
    英国居民委实是在为新加坡而发抖。
    我们有着不止一次的机缘去和当地的英国居民谈论新加坡。而且，当他们试图使自己相信，也使我们相信，新加坡会永远为警卫东南亚的英国殖民地的一个可靠的步哨时，我们几乎总可在他们脸孔上看出希望和惊惧交织的表情。然而，他们也明白新加坡是处在“动荡的亚细亚”的心脏地区，易于被汹涌澎湃的民族解放运动的洪流所覆没的。
