China Grain Company Inspects Grain Reserves Nationwide
　　Severe Mold and Rot in Xuzhou
　　Ministry of Trade Decides to Dispatch Special Personnel for Thorough Investigation

　　[This Newspaper’s Report] To promote summer grain storage work, the China Grain Company sent cadres to various parts of East China in April to conduct overturning and inspection of grain warehouses. The inspection results revealed a serious situation at the Xuzhou Grain Branch, where 1,247,000 jin of Northeast corn in storage had begun to heat up, mold, and rot (of which 529,000 jin were heating up and had a taste but were edible, 549,000 jin were moldy but barely edible, and 168,200 jin were moldy and rotten and inedible). The China Grain Company has truthfully reported this to the Ministry of Trade. The Ministry of Trade has telegraphed the East China Trade Department to send people to inspect and decided to send special personnel to the area for a detailed investigation before handling the matter.

　　According to preliminary understanding, the reasons for the grain mold and rot at the Xuzhou Grain Branch are as follows: In March, Shen Ruhong, the former manager of the Xuzhou Municipal Trading Company, without considering the city's existing grain stocks and warehouse conditions, and without jointly studying the matter with the relevant departments, requested the allocation of 10 million jin of grain from higher-level companies. Subsequent inspection revealed that such a large amount of grain was not needed, but the grain had already been transported, leading to excessive grain stocks and a shortage of warehouses. In order to strengthen summer grain storage work, the higher-level company issued relevant grain storage documents to the company, which were also piled up. The comrade responsible for grain storage also failed to turn and dry the grain in a timely manner. Ge, the deputy manager of the company, emphasized objective difficulties, believing that Xuzhou has a lot of rain and should not ship grain, and complained that the higher authorities did not solve the warehouse problem, adopting a negative resistance, irresponsible, unexamined bureaucracy and liberalism’s bad attitude, causing huge losses. In addition, the Shandong Trade General Company also sent special personnel to inspect in advance, but because the inspection was not thorough and superficial, the grain mildew phenomenon was not discovered and effectively stopped in time. At the same time, when the Xuzhou Trading Company was undergoing adjustments, some cadres had confused thoughts and were not actively responsible, which was also one of the reasons for the loss of state assets this time. This is a phenomenon worthy of serious attention.

　　中国粮食公司检查各地存粮
　　徐州霉烂现象严重     
    贸易部决定派专人彻查
    【本报讯】中国粮食公司为促进夏季粮食保管工作，曾于四月份派干部分赴华东各地进行粮食仓库的翻晒检查。检查结果，发现徐州粮食分公司所存东北玉米一百二十四万七千斤已开始发热、发霉和已经霉烂（其中发热有味能吃的有五十二万九千斤，发霉而勉强能吃的有五十四万九千斤，霉烂不能吃的有十六万八千二百斤）的严重现象。中国粮食公司已据实呈报贸易部。贸易部已电华东贸易部派人检查，并决定派专人至该地进行详细调查后再予以处理。
    根据初步了解，徐州粮食分公司所以招致粮食霉烂的情况如下：前徐州市贸易公司经理申如鸿于三月份，不根据市内存粮与仓库情况，且没有与主管部门共同加以研究，即向上级公司请求调拔粮食一千万斤，事后检查并非需要这样大批粮食，但粮食已经运去。致形成存粮过多、仓库缺乏的现象。上级公司为加强夏季粮食保管工作，向该公司所发之有关粮食保管文件亦被积压，而负责粮食保管同志亦未及时翻晒。该公司葛副经理强调客观困难，认为徐州多雨，不该发运粮食；且埋怨上级不解决仓库问题，采取了消极抵抗，不负责任，不加检查的官僚主义与自由主义的恶劣态度，造成巨大损失。此外山东贸总事先亦派专人检查，但因检查不深入和粗枝在叶，致粮食发霉现象没有及早发现，予以有效的制止。同时，徐州贸易公司进行调整时，部分干部思想混乱，不积极负责，亦是这次国家资财遭受损失的原因之一。这是值得严重注意的现象。
