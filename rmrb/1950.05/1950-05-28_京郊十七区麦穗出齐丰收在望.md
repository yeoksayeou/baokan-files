　　Suburban Beijing Seventeen Districts Wheat Ears Appear, Harvest in Sight
　　[Report from this newspaper] "Small Full" (a solar term) has passed, and in the seventeen districts of suburban Beijing, the wheat ears have fully emerged, blooming and filling with grain. It is estimated that harvesting can begin in another three weeks. The entire district planted more than 48,000 mu of wheat last year (1.4 times more than the previous year). Farmers, after land reform, have high production enthusiasm. This spring, most wheat fields have been top-dressed with fertilizer and weeded. In addition, the rainfall has been even, and the wheat plants are strong and lush.
　　According to experienced farmers, the wheat is particularly good this year. Judging from the current situation, as long as there is no hail, the wheat harvest is guaranteed. The average yield per mu is expected to be eight dou (15 jin per dou; the average yield last year was more than three dou per mu), with the best yields reaching one shi and four or five dou.

　　京郊十七区麦穗出齐丰收在望
    【本报讯】“小满”已过，京郊十七区小麦麦穗出齐，扬花灌浆，估计再过三周即可收割。全区去年种麦四万八千余亩（较前年多一·四倍）。土地改革后的农民，生产情绪高涨；今春绝大部分麦地都已施追肥和除草，加以雨水调匀，麦稞茁壮茂盛。
    据有经验的农民谈：今年的麦子特别好，照眼前情形看，只要不落雹，麦收是有保证了。每亩地平均要打八斗（每斗十五市斤，去年平均收成是每亩三斗多），最好的可打上一石四、五。
