Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 20th: Since the liberation of Wuhan, public and private industries have gradually recovered and partially developed.

By March of this year, twenty-five types of public industries, including hydro-electric power, machinery, steel, and cement, which were largely shut down before and in the early days of liberation, had generally exceeded their pre-liberation production levels. Among them, the cloth output of the Hankou Dyeing and Weaving Factory exceeded twice the usual monthly output before liberation; the chemical factory's soap output exceeded 30.6%; and the Huaxin Cement Factory produced only 332 tons of cement in May last year, but this increased to more than 4,000 tons in February this year. Due to the increased class consciousness and production enthusiasm of workers after liberation, the achievements demonstrated in terms of enterprise management efficiency are far beyond what could be compared before liberation. Taking Wuhan's hydro-electric power enterprises, which are necessary for production and people's needs, as an example, the coal consumption rate per kilowatt-hour of the Jiji Hydroelectric Power Company in April this year decreased by 33% compared with before liberation; the stolen and leaked electricity also decreased from 41.2% of the total power generation before liberation to 6.61%. As a result, the company's business situation has turned from a loss to a profit.

Private industry has also increased by more than 200 businesses in the past year, with an increase of 7,000 employees. According to statistics from the Bureau of Industry and Commerce in early April, there are 950 private factories in Wuhan with power equipment or regularly employing more than ten workers. The textile industry accounts for a large proportion of private industry. In April this year, 120,000 spindles were transferred, an increase of 20,000 spindles compared with before liberation; the number of looms in operation also increased from 140 to 549; yarn production doubled compared with June last year; and cloth production was more than seven times that of June last year. The production of other industries such as soap, matches, and flour has also increased, while industries with high-end consumer characteristics such as fur, food, and Western clothing have shrunk.

In the recovery process of Wuhan's private industry, the leadership and support of public enterprises have played a significant role. In the past year, the Hankou Municipal People's Bank has provided loans totaling more than 30 billion yuan to private factories, covering more than 500 factories in more than 20 industries. In order to organize social idle funds for investment in production, the bank led the formation of a joint lending office by private banks and money shops throughout the city in April this year, and the loan fund has increased from 2 billion yuan to 16 billion yuan. The raw material and sales problems of private factories have also been partially resolved due to the commissioned processing and ordering by public trading departments. For example, in the cotton textile industry, the First Yarn Factory has successively processed and produced 10,000 pieces of cotton yarn and 60,000 pieces of cloth for the public yarn and cloth company; the flour, rice milling, towel, dyeing, and weaving industries have also processed large quantities for the government. From October last year to April this year, the total value of orders placed by Wuhan's public enterprises and institutions for bricks, tiles, sawn timber, knitted goods, toothbrushes, leather shoes, and other industries was equivalent to more than 188.8 million kilograms of rice.

### 武汉市公营工业生产普遍超过解放前水平  私营工业一年增加二百多户

　　武汉市公营工业生产普遍超过解放前水平         
    私营工业一年增加二百多户
    【新华社汉口二十日电】武汉市解放一年来，公私营工业已逐步恢复，并部分地得到发展。
    解放前和解放初期大部停工的水电、机械、钢铁、水泥等二十五种公营工业，到今年三月已普遍超过解放前生产水平。其中，汉口染织厂的布匹产量超过解放前经常月产量二倍；化工厂的肥皂超过百分之三十点六；华新水泥去年五月仅产水泥三百三十二吨，今年二月已增至四千吨以上。由于工人在解放后阶级觉悟和生产积极性提高，企业经营管理效率方面所表现出的成就已远非解放前所能比拟。以武汉市生产与民需所必需的水电企业为例，既济水电公司今年四月份每度电的燃煤率已较解放前降低了百分之三十三；被偷漏的电力也由解放前占总发电量的百分之四十一点二降低为百分之六点六一。因而该公司的营业状况已从亏本转为盈余。
    私营工业一年来亦增加了二百余户，职工增加了七千人。据四月上旬工商局统计，武汉市有动力设备或经常雇用十名以上工人的私营工厂共有九百五十家。私营工业中比重较大的是纺织业，今年四月转运纱锭有十二万枚，较解放前增加二万枚；开动布机也由一百四十台增至五百四十九台；纱产量较去年六月份增加一倍；布产量则为去年六月份的七倍以上。其他如肥皂、火柴、面粉等业生产量亦有增加，而皮毛、食品、洋服等高级消费性的行业则见萎缩。
    在武汉私营工业的恢复过程中，公营企业的领导与扶植曾发挥了重大作用。一年来，汉口市人民银行对私营工厂贷款共三百余亿元，贷款对象遍及二十余种工业共五百余家。为组织社会游资投入生产，该行于今年四月又领导全市私营银钱业组成联合放款处，贷款基金已自二十亿元增至一百六十亿元。私营工厂的原料和销路问题，也因得到公营贸易部门的委托加工及定货而得到部分解决。如棉纺织业中，第一纱厂即先后为公营纱布公司加工生产棉纱一万件，布六万匹；面粉、碾米、毛巾、染织等业也为政府大量加工。去年十月到今年四月，武汉公营企业和机关对砖瓦、锯木、针织、牙刷、皮鞋等业的定货总值共折合大米一亿八千八百余万斤。
