　　Launch a Production Increase Campaign to Greet "May Day"
    Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Sets Iron Smelting Record
    [Our Dispatch] To welcome the first "May Day" Labor Day after the founding of the People's Republic of China, the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant launched a production increase campaign and created a new production record. Since April 18, the Iron Smelting Department of the plant, in this production increase campaign, overcame the difficulties of raw materials and hanging charges caused by rain, and finally broke through the original planned daily pig iron production on April 27, creating a new record.
    The original planned daily output of 150 cm pipes in the first pipe workshop of the foundry department was 190 pipes, and the actual output was 180 pipes. This production increase campaign reached a record of 200 pipes per day; the yield rate increased from 90% to 98%. The original planned daily output of 250 cm and 200 cm pipes in the second pipe workshop was 100 pipes, and the actual output was 88 pipes, but now it has reached 106 pipes; the yield rate increased from 85% to 96%. In the sand casting workshop, the number of steel ingot molds made by twelve people per day increased from five to six by ten people per day. In addition, the casting work improved work efficiency by 10%, and the large furnace smelting furnace, after research and reconstruction, broke through the original plan of 65 tons from more than 40 tons per day to reach 86 tons. They also ensure the safety of machinery and personnel, maintain the current production figures and gradually increase them.
    The forging and welding workshop of the repair department also launched a production increase challenge. The forging and welding project of the furnace top ring of the second iron smelting furnace, which was originally estimated to require 120 workdays, they strive to complete in 40 workdays; the various repair work in the coal washing plant, which was estimated to require 140 workdays, is now striving to complete in 68 workdays. The assembly workshop, machine workshop, locomotive workshop, crane workshop, and mold workshop have all responded to the production increase challenge one after another. It was originally stipulated to go to work at 7:30 in the morning, but now many people come at 6:00.
    The power department also challenged the entire plant on the 25th: 1. Ensure full supply of water and electricity to the entire plant. 2. If any unexpected problems occur in each department, be there when called to ensure repairs. 3. The operation workers and repair workers signed a contact agreement to ensure safe operation. 4. Ensure that not a single kilowatt of electricity, a drop of oil, a drop of water, a puff of air, or a piece of coal is wasted.
    The operation department launched the "Three Diligences" campaign: 1. Diligently ask and diligently contact. For example, in water distribution, proactively ask the power plant about the water temperature. 2. Diligently watch and diligently rub. For example, always test the temperature gauge and the vibration force of the machine. 3. Diligently smell. For example, if the temperature of the motor coil increases, it will cause problems and give off a smell, and frequent attention can prevent it early. The repair department implemented the "Two Diligences": 1. Diligent inspection. 2. Diligent research. Find out the possible causes of failure and prevent them early. The coking department's coking oven guarantees that the daily coke output of groups A, B, and C will increase from 84 ovens to 90 ovens, the coal washing plant guarantees that the ash content of coke will not exceed 18-19%, and the byproduct plant guarantees that the daily tar output will increase from 14 tons to 50 tons.
    The transportation section also put forward the slogan of "Guaranteeing the completion of transportation tasks." Under the difficult conditions of extremely scarce wagons, the iron smelting furnace used to allocate two wagons for each iron tapping, but now it guarantees the supply of three wagons, and they are available whenever needed.

　　展开增产运动迎接“五一”
    石景山钢铁厂炼铁创纪录
    【本报讯】石景山钢铁厂职工为迎接中华人民共和国成立后的第一个“五一”劳动节，展开增产运动创造了生产新纪录。该厂炼铁部自四月十八日在这次增产运动中，战胜了因下雨所造成的原料和挂料的困难，终于在四月二十七日突破原订日产生铁的计划，创造出新纪录。
    铸造部一管场一五○厘米管子的日产量原订计划为一百九十根，实产一百八十根，此次增产运动达到了日产二百根的纪录；成品率由百分之九十增至百分之九十八。二管场二五○厘和二○○厘管子的日产量原订计划为一百根实产量八十八根现在却达到了一百零六根；成品率由百分之八十五增至百分之九十六。翻砂场钢锭模由十二人每天作五个，增至十人每天作六个。其他，铸件，则提高了工作效率百分之十，大炉化铁炉子经过研究改砌后，由日化四十多吨突破了原订计划六十五吨达到了八十六吨。他们并保证机器和人员的安全，把现在的生产数字保持下去并逐步提高。
    修理部锻焊场也发起增产挑战，原估计需一百二十个工的第二炼铁炉炉顶炉圈锻焊工程，他们争取以四十个工完成；洗煤场各种修理工作，估计需一百四十个工，现争取以六十八个工完成。装配场、机器场、机车场、起重场、铸型场，均已相继应战增产，原规定早上七点半上班，现在好多人六点就来了。
    动力部亦于二十五日向全厂挑战：一、保证充分供应全厂水电。二、各部发生意外毛病，随叫随到保证修好。三、运转工与修理工订立联系公约，保证安全运转。四、保证不浪费一度电、一滴油、一滴水、一股气、一块煤。
    运行部门展开了三勤运动：一、勤问勤联系。如配水方面主动问发电所的水温高低。二、勤看勤摩。如随时试看温度表和机器的振动力。三、勤闻。如马达线包温度增高，要出毛病就会出味，时常注意可及早预防。修理部门则实行了二勤：一、勤检查。二、勤研究。找出可能发生故障原因，及早预防。炼焦部焦炉保证甲、乙、丙三组炉每日出焦由八十四炉增至九十炉，洗煤场保证焦炭灰份不超过百分之一八——一九，副产场保证焦油产量由每日十四吨增至五十吨。
    运输课，也提出“保证完成运输任务”的口号，在车皮十分缺乏的困难条件下，炼铁炉过去出一次铁拨用二辆车皮，现在保证供给三辆，而且随要随到。
