　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th: Under the leadership of the People's Government, the people of Suxian Special District in northern Anhui have overcome the new flooding that occurred this spring after a month of drainage and replanting. The drained spring fields in the entire district are about to be sown, and the drained wheat is beginning to bloom and bear fruit. The early-planted sorghum has emerged half a foot above the ground. In Sihong County (newly established county, southern Suxian), the worst-hit area, more than 200,000 affected farmers, under the slogan of "replant wherever drainage is done," launched a crash replanting, sowing 400,000 mu of land in one week. In Suxian County, 560,000 mu of flooded wheat fields have been drained, and 190,000 mu of spring fields have been sown. Currently, male and female farmers in the county are using methods such as digging and sowing to carry out crash replanting, which is estimated to be completed around the Grain Full (Xiaoman) period in late May. At the same time as the replanting, the county is also focusing on repairing the Anhe, Suihe, and Bianhe rivers that run through the territory, with a total length of more than 200 li. The project will be completed on the 20th of this month, which will ensure the autumn harvest of 500,000 to 600,000 mu of low-lying land.

　　The Suxian Special District People's Government has formulated long-term production self-rescue measures for Sihong, Suxian, Lingbi, and other counties that were severely affected by the new disaster. It plans to lend 1,000 head of cattle to Sihong County, which lacks draft animals; and lend 700 small boats and 300 large boats to fishermen, grass cutters, and farmers along Hongze Lake to help them develop fishing, cutting aquatic plants, raising ducks, and transportation and other sideline productions, which can solve the year-round livelihood of more than 10,000 people. The Suxian County People's Government has also decided to sow 80,000 mu of upland rice and barnyard grass, and 200,000 mu of sorghum, and ensure that 50 oil mills, 4,000 hand-cranked spinning wheels, and 1,000 looms are used for oil extraction, spinning, and weaving. In addition, the Special District People's Government has also decided to organize immigration in a planned manner, relocating about 30,000 disaster victims from the Hongze Lake coast of Sihong County, the Chantang Lake area of Lingbi County, and Suxian County. Most of the relocated disaster victims will be sent to non-disaster or lightly affected areas in northern Anhui to reclaim wasteland, and a small number will be moved to barren mountains in the county for reclamation.

　　Due to the breaching of the Yellow River into the Huai River by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang in 1938, the Huai River and Hongze Lake were silted up with sediment, and even a little rain would cause flooding, resulting in continuous flooding in northern Anhui. In mid-April, Suxian Special District had seven consecutive days of heavy rain, resulting in new flooding, with 910,000 mu of wheat fields flooded in Suxian County alone. After the new disaster occurred, the Anhui North Administrative Office immediately allocated 20 million catties of relief grain and 2 million catties of salt for emergency rescue. Local leading organs quickly mobilized and organized farmers to drain water to save wheat, replant early-maturing grains and vegetables, and autumn crops. Zeng Xisheng, Secretary of the Anhui North District Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Liu Jingfan, head of the Central People's Government's inspection team for disaster conditions in the plains and northern Anhui, personally inspected the disaster areas such as Suxian County and provided specific guidance for disaster relief work. After more than a month of joint efforts by Party and government workers and disaster victims, the new disaster was finally overcome.

### 宿县专区战胜水灾　排水抢种即将完毕　治河工程二百余里亦将竣工

　　宿县专区战胜水灾
　　排水抢种即将完毕
　　治河工程二百余里亦将竣工
    【新华社上海十五日电】皖北宿县专区人民在人民政府领导下，经过一个月的排水抢种，业已战胜了今春发生的新的水灾。全区脱水的春田即将播种完毕，脱水的小麦正开始扬花结子：早种的高粱已出土半尺。灾情最重的泗洪县（新设县，泗县南部）二十余万受灾农民在“干一块种一块”的口号下突击抢种，一个星期内就播种了四十万亩地。宿县被淹的麦田已有五十六万亩脱水，十九万亩春田已经下种，现全县男女农民正以刨种、耩种等办法进行抢种，估计于五月下旬小满前后可以播种完毕。与抢种同时，该县并有重点地进行修治贯穿境内的安河、濉河、汴河等河流，工程共长二百余里，将于本月二十日竣工，从而可使五六十万亩洼地的秋收得到保证。
    宿县专区人民政府对新灾较重的泗洪、宿县、灵璧等县已作出长期的生产自救办法，准备对缺乏耕牛的泗洪县贷出耕牛一千头；对洪泽湖沿岸的渔民、草民和农民贷给小船七百只、大船三百只，以帮助他们开展捕鱼、砍水草、放鸭及运输等副业生产，可以解决一万人以上的长年生活。宿县人民政府又决定播种旱稻和稗子八万亩，高粱二十万亩，保证五十个油坊、四千辆手摇纺花车、一千部织布机进行榨油、纺花织布等生产。此外，专区人民政府并决定有计划地组织移民，从泗洪县洪泽湖沿岸、灵璧县禅堂湖一带及宿县等地移出灾民三万人左右。所移灾民大部分将遣送至皖北非灾区或轻灾区开荒，一小部分则移至本县荒山开垦。
    由于一九三八年蒋介石匪帮决黄入淮，致使淮河、洪泽湖泥沙壅塞，雨水稍多即泛滥成灾，因此皖北水灾连年不断。宿县专区曾在四月中旬连下七天大雨，致又发生新的水灾，仅宿县被淹麦田即达九十一万亩。当新灾发生后，皖北行署立即拨发救济粮二千万斤、食盐二百万斤进行紧急抢救；各地领导机关均迅速地动员与组织农民排水救麦、补种早熟粮菜和秋禾。中共皖北区党委书记曾希圣，中央人民政府平原、皖北灾情视察组组长刘景范均亲往宿县等灾区巡视并具体指导救灾工作。党政工作人员及灾民经过一个多月来的共同努力，终于克服了新的灾害。
