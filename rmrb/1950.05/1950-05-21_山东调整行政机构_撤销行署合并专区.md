Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 19th: The Shandong Provincial People's Government announced on the 11th of this month the decision to abolish administrative offices, merge special districts, and adjust the administrative divisions of some cities and counties. This is an important measure in Shandong Province's reorganization work and has been approved by the East China Military and Political Committee.

According to the decision, the administrative offices in the Jiaodong, Bohai, and Lu Zhongnan areas will be abolished, and the original seventeen special districts will be merged into eleven special districts, each with a commissioner's office as an agency of the provincial government. Jinan, Qingdao, and Xuzhou will remain as cities, Yantai will be placed under the Wendeng Special District, and all other cities will be abolished and merged into the relevant counties. The administrative divisions of the counties have also been adjusted accordingly. All the abolished organs mentioned above will cease operations from June 1st. The decision also stipulates that during the handover period, all localities must firmly grasp the current tasks, especially production and disaster relief work, and must not have any slackness or negligence. For personnel outside and beyond the establishment, a cautious and responsible attitude must be adopted, resolutely implementing the policy of respect, care, and encouragement, awaiting disposal.

The Shandong Provincial People's Government was gradually established and developed during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the four-year War of Liberation. In the past, due to the enemy's division and blockade, the administrative offices, under the unified leadership of the province, were responsible for one aspect of the work, which played a great role in winning the victory of the war. However, now that the entire territory of Shandong has been liberated and transportation has been restored, facing the historical task of restoration and construction, the organizational forms and administrative divisions that were adapted to the decentralized war environment in the past must be changed and adjusted. The measures taken by the Shandong Provincial People's Government this time will reduce the number of levels, streamline many institutions, and improve administrative efficiency. At the same time, it can also adjust cadres to replenish and strengthen people's government organizations at all levels.

　　山东调整行政机构
    撤销行署合并专区
    【新华社济南十九日电】山东省人民政府于本月十一日公布撤销行政公署，合并专员区及调整若干市、县行政区划的决定。这是山东省整编工作中的一项重要措施，已经华东军政委员会批准。
    根据该决定，胶东、渤海、鲁中南三个地区的行政公署即行撤销，原十七个专员区合并为十一个专员区，各设专员公署，作为省府的派出机关。济南、青岛、徐州三市仍旧，烟台市划归文登专员区，其他各市一律撤销，分别归并有关各县。各县行政区划也分别进行了调整。以上被撤销的各机关，自六月一日起即停止办公。决定中还规定，在交接时期中，各地对当前各项工作，尤其是生产救灾工作，必须抓紧进行，不得有任何松弛和疏忽。对于编外、编余人员，务须采取慎重负责的态度，坚决贯彻尊重、爱护、鼓励的方针，听候处理。
    山东省人民政权是在八年抗日战争和四年解放战争中逐步建立和发展起来的。过去由于敌人的分割封锁，各行政公署在省的统一领导下，负责一方面工作，对争取战争的胜利起了很大的作用。但是，目前山东全境已告解放，交通已经恢复，面临着恢复和建设的历史任务，因此，过去为了适应分散的战争环境的组织形式和行政区划都必须加以改变和调整。山东省人民政府此次采取的措施，将使得层次减少了一级，精简不少机构，提高行政效率：同时还可以调整干部，充实和加强各级人民政权组织。
