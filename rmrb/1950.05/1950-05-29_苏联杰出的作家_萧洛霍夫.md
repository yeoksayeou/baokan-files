　　Today is May 24th, and it marks the 45th anniversary of Sholokhov's birth.

　　Sholokhov is an outstanding Soviet writer, a recipient of the Stalin Prize, a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, and a current academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.

　　Sholokhov currently lives and works in Veshenskaya village on the Don River. This is his hometown, where he spent his childhood and adolescence.

　　Sholokhov's mother was a Cossack, and his father migrated from Ryazan Province to the Don region, owning very little land and renting land from a Cossack. He changed many jobs throughout his life.

　　Sholokhov's mother was an uneducated woman. However, after her son left home to study, she began to learn to read and write so that she could write letters to him.

　　Sholokhov studied until 1918 when the Civil War began. He left middle school to join the revolutionary Cossack forces to fight. At this time, Sholokhov was only thirteen years old.

　　Two years later, he organized the first Communist Youth League group in the countryside and fought against counter-revolutionary bandits. This was his most difficult period. Sholokhov once recalled this period: "We chased the bandits who ruled the Don, and the bandits chased us. It was very complicated at that time."

　　After the counter-revolutionary bandits on the Don were defeated, Sholokhov worked as a stonemason, porter, and teacher.

　　Sholokhov began writing in 1923, and his early short stories were published that year.

　　His work was carried out under difficult circumstances. His house was exceptionally small, and he often had to worry about earning money.

　　His friends and relatives expressed doubts about his strength and creative ability and ridiculed his enthusiasm for literature.

　　During his childhood, his father encouraged him to read more books, but now he felt distressed by his diligence in literature. His father cited various reasons to illustrate that he could not become a true writer. However, two years later, his initial works, two novels, were published.

　　Sholokhov began writing and continued to write about the life of the Cossacks on the Don because he knew more about Cossack life than others.

　　Sholokhov believes that authenticity is the basic law of art. He is determined to depict real life, writing whatever he sees, without any embellishment.

　　In his first few short stories, Sholokhov wrote about the events on the Don during the Civil War.

　　The Soviet regime on the Don was declared in fierce battles, which left an indelible impression on Sholokhov's memory. Therefore, he found the subject matter for his works here.

　　Sholokhov honestly depicted the sharp class struggle among the Don Cossacks.

　　In his early short stories, he was already skilled in depicting the typical figures of the enemy accurately. These enemies guarded their cruel rights with ferocity and malice. He described the ruthless and inhumane counter-revolutionaries, and he described the brutal revenge of the rich peasants on the leaders of the poor peasants.

　　In the short story "Deadly Enemy," the rich peasants plotted to murder Yefim because Yefim had actively fought to consolidate the Soviet regime, and he was a leader of the revolutionary Cossacks.

　　However, the ferocity and hatred of the enemy described by Sholokhov is a desperate hatred, a weak hatred, a hatred of people who cannot continue to survive in society.

　　Yefim, the secretary of the village soviet, knew that the enemy might murder him, and his friends also knew this. But his friends said to him: "Yefim! You must remember! If they murder you, then twenty new Yefims will be born. Do you understand? Just like the hero in the story, after one is killed, two are born."

　　Sholokhov paid special attention to depicting the discord among relatives caused by class struggle in Cossack families.

　　"It is as if someone has dug a ditch to divide people into two opposing camps."

　　Sholokhov explained even family conflicts with the laws of class struggle. The hostile struggle between the two sides in the family he described reached a particularly sharp form.

　　In the struggle for private property and land, a rich peasant father and his eldest son killed their youngest son—a member of the Communist Youth League.

　　A White Guard officer shot his father and brothers who were captured during the retreat.

　　A bandit leader killed his son in battle because his son was a Red Guard commander.

　　A new life was born in many bloody and cruel battles.

　　However, Sholokhov was good at discovering the excellent qualities of a person in this cruel and ruthless battle, and he was good at describing the people with these excellent qualities—the Communists.

　　Sholokhov's short stories are full of faith in people. These short stories describe the sublimity of people in the most difficult situations, people who are prepared to dedicate everything for their duties and are willing to sacrifice their lives to save others. The Communist Party member Bajia Gen encountered a frozen boy on the road. He put him on his horse, and the White Guards were chasing them from behind, but he could not leave the boy behind. He gave his horse to the boy, and although he knew he was facing death, he still stayed there. Yefim also belongs to such a typical figure.

　　In the struggle with the rich peasants, he was not afraid, nor was he afraid of being shot at from outside the window. He was loyal to his cause and fought to the end for the cause.

　　Sholokhov's early short stories are the preface to his future novels "And Quiet Flows the Don" and "Virgin Soil Upturned." These two novels brought Sholokhov the honor of becoming "one of the best Soviet writers."

　　He wrote "And Quiet Flows the Don" for fourteen years. In it, he described the characteristics of Cossack life before and after the revolution, the sharpening of class hatred, and the difficult and arduous road that the Cossacks went through to the revolution.

　　"And Quiet Flows the Don" is the history of the Civil War on the Don and the history of gradually overcoming the enemy's fierce resistance and establishing a new life on the Don.

　　The novel "And Quiet Flows the Don" creates a complete image for readers of the great people's movement, which destroyed all obstacles in its path.

　　The novel "And Quiet Flows the Don" can be rightly called an encyclopedia of Cossack life on the Don.

　　This novel presents all the characteristics of Cossack life to the reader. A Cossack is a kind of farmer, a special type of farmer—a farmer with the character of a warrior. From childhood, they were prepared and trained to become honorable figures defending the motherland. When they were still children, they were trained to use weapons and ride horses. The traditions, heroism, and fortitude passed down from generation to generation by the Cossacks, fearlessness of death, and patriotism were developed among the Cossacks.

　　Cossack songs praise military service and military exploits. The military bravery of the Cossacks was tempered in the long struggle against the autocratic regime. The autocratic regime had repeatedly tried to subdue the Cossacks, but without success. Later, the autocratic regime used another method: giving the Cossacks many privileges and instructing them to have the idea of ​​ethnic solidarity.

　　The autocratic authorities forced the Cossacks to believe them with all their strength and various methods, making the Cossacks believe that they were nobler in blood than the Russian peasants. They tried to turn the Cossacks into a pillar of reactionary forces. Because of these things, the Cossacks took a special path to the revolution. Therefore, class conflicts were particularly severe among the Cossacks at that time. The process of the Cossack masses finally transitioning to socialism was long and arduous.

　　Sholokhov also described the complexity of this process in "And Quiet Flows the Don." He pointed out the struggles and final hesitation experienced in the Cossacks. The Cossacks finally decided to permanently link their lives with the life of the socialist motherland.

　　"And Quiet Flows the Don" cannot be seen merely as an epic of Cossack life. The theme of Sholokhov's book is much broader. He wrote the tragic path of a person who deviated from his people and ruined his life with the main character of this book, Milikhov.

　　No matter what strengths a person has, if he is separated from his people, if he does not go in the same direction as his motherland, if he does not fight for the motherland to participate in labor in peacetime and establish merits in wartime, then people cannot help him. Separating from the people is heading towards death. Milikhov, described by Sholokhov, is a typical example of this kind of person.

　　In the novel "Virgin Soil Upturned," Sholokhov pointed out that the basic masses of the Cossacks finally embarked on the path of socialism. This novel describes the final and decisive battle with the exploiting classes in the countryside. This is a novel about the transition of the Cossack laborers on the Don to the socialist road.

　　This novel, in terms of its characteristics to Soviet literature, lies in its close connection with the facts. This is particularly evident in Sholokhov's "Virgin Soil Upturned."

　　The main idea of ​​the work determines the overall structure of the work. The plot is not connected with the fate of individual heroes, but with the social and political history of the country. Therefore, the plot of this novel is in line with the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the overall collectivization of agriculture and the elimination of rich peasants as a class. The worker Davydov appeared in connection with this resolution. He is the organizer of the collective farm. This resolution also caused the appearance of the White bandit Polovtsev, who united all the rich peasants and led them to make counter-revolutionary disturbances.

　　If the resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) on the overall collectivization of agriculture is the beginning of the development of the events written in the novel "Virgin Soil Upturned," then Comrade Stalin's article "Dizzy with Success" published in the newspaper in March 1930 determined the road for the continued development of this event.

　　Polovtsev's counter-revolutionary plan suffered a defeat under the influence of this article.

　　The Cossacks who were seduced by Polovtsev refused to support Polovtsev after reading the newspaper that published Comrade Stalin's article. A Cossack declared to Polovtsev: "We are not on the same path as you. Since the owner protects us, why should we run on another road?"

　　The entire content of this novel, as well as the course and development of events, are related to domestic historical events and specific political facts.

　　Based on specific historical opportunities, Sholokhov wrote about the growth of new types of people in the countryside and the desperate resistance of class enemies.

　　Sholokhov used very clever techniques to describe the poor peasants. Only under the Soviet regime can they breathe completely freely. He is also good at describing the middle peasants. Although the middle peasants have also had great fluctuations, they have finally completely turned to agricultural collectivization.

　　After reading this novel, we will feel that the foundation for promoting everything in the new rural life is the party organization.

　　The heroes in Sholokhov's writing are simple and ordinary people. They are people who participate in labor. Labor gives them joy and the meaning of life. Only special events and external coercion can separate them from labor. The foundation of their lives is labor.

　　Sholokhov, the writer of truth, described the heroes who are working every day in this way.

　　The heroes in Sholokhov's writings never talk about themselves. It is easier for them to complete their labor feats than to talk about themselves. Although they do not utter patriotic words, the writer clearly sees their actions. These people are the real patriots. They can die, but they will never betray the people, the party, or the motherland.

　　Sholokhov compares the people in the enemy's camp—the rich peasants in the countryside—with these people who have new character and new morality. He shows the malicious intentions of the enemy and arouses the readers' hatred for them.

　　Sholokhov's voice is the voice of the working people. These working people are the people who complete amazing labor feats in peacetime and stand up to defend their motherland in wartime.

　　During the war, Sholokhov wrote a short story called "The Science of Hatred." The collective brutality shown by the German army reached a degree of cruelty that the whole world and our country had not imagined.

　　The enemy's cruel and inhuman purpose aroused irreconcilable hatred in the hearts of all Soviet patriots.

　　Sholokhov's "The Science of Hatred" writes about the growth of hatred for the fascist German aggressors. This short story reveals the true situation of the peace-loving and benevolent Russians, the generation and consolidation of hatred in their hearts.

　　The protagonist of this short story is Sergeant Gerasimov.

　　Before the war, he worked as a technician in a factory. He is a good head of the household, a loyal comrade, and an excellent Communist Party member. He knows that in this war he will encounter a powerful and cruel enemy, but he did not expect the baseness of the fascists to reach an unimaginable level.

　　Gerasimov said: "In good conscience, I never expected the enemy to be particularly honest. What honesty is there in dealing with fascists? But I really did not expect my enemy to be such a German army—shameless scum."

　　Gerasimov saw many things in the war: the enemy burned entire villages to the ground, shot old people and children, brutally murdered captured Red Army soldiers, and brutally murdered women and girls, etc.

　　He saw that even nature was insulted by Hitler's barbaric soldiers. They regarded trees as a gallows and the valley where the stream flows as a natural tomb for those they murdered and shot.

　　Sergeant Gerasimov experienced the difficult road of being a prisoner. He understood that the enemy's purpose was to eliminate the Russian nation, so Gerasimov's psychology was filled with hatred for the enemy.

　　Sholokhov's short story teaches people hatred for the enemy and love for the motherland. Hatred for the enemy and love for the motherland are the most powerful manifestations of patriotism. Hatred for the enemy and love for the motherland are the correct path to victory.

　　This is the central idea of ​​Sholokhov's short story "The Science of Hatred."

　　Now Sholokhov is writing a novel whose theme is the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet people against the German aggressors. The name of this novel is "They Fought for Their Country," and this novel has not yet been completed. Sholokhov likes to revise his works for a long time and carefully. The chapters of this novel have been published separately. It describes the heroic deeds of Soviet soldiers covering the enemy's machine gun mouths with their chests, lying under the enemy's tanks with grenades tied around their waists, and driving planes to make suicide attacks on the enemy.

　　This book narrates that Soviet soldiers not only show their strong strength, but also represent the strength of their people and the strength of their party.

　　This book is full of the belief that truth will win. It confirms what Comrade Molotov said: "Our cause is truthful, the enemy will be defeated, and victory will belong to us."

　　No matter how the Germans spread death and destruction, the will to survive of the glorious people cannot be defeated.

　　Sholokhov wrote "Words about the Motherland" after the war. He said that our hatred for the enemy cannot be diluted, and our hatred for the preparers of new wars should be increased a hundredfold. Every honest person should curse their names.

　　Since the establishment of the Soviet regime, the Soviet state has never suffered defeat, whether in war or in overcoming any difficulties.

　　Our party is great and powerful. It can organize, educate, and arm the people and lead them to complete great undertakings unprecedented in history.

　　These great and invincible people can not only defend the independence of their motherland and defeat all enemies, but have also become the only beacon of hope for the working people of the world.

　　Sholokhov believes that it is a blessing to be a loyal son of such a party and such people, and Sholokhov is indeed a loyal son of such a party and such people.

　　Sholokhov's works have won the love and gratitude of the Soviet people for good reason.

　　Sholokhov receives dozens and hundreds of letters from readers in Veshenskaya village, which shows Sholokhov's closeness to the people, which means that he wisely answers the main thoughts and questions of our people with his works.

　　Sholokhov's creation is a high level of art, and this art is the art that Lenin said "belongs to the people."

　　苏联杰出的作家——萧洛霍夫
    维诺格拉多娃讲
    邹宁译
    此文系维诺格拉多娃教授一九五○年五月二十四日在北京市中苏友好协会、北京苏联对外文化协会联合主办“萧洛霍夫四十五岁诞辰庆祝会”上的报告。
                                                  编者
    今天是五月二十四日，从萧洛霍夫诞生那天起到今天整整满了四十五年。
    萧洛霍夫是杰出的苏联作家，斯大林奖金的获得者，苏联最高苏维埃的代表，苏联科学院的现任院士。
    萧洛霍夫现在生活和工作在顿河上的维新斯克村里。这是他的故乡，他在这里度过了自己的童年和少年时期。
    萧洛霍夫的母亲是哥萨克人，父亲是从梁赞斯克省移居顿河区域的，自己土地很少，租种着一个哥萨克人的土地。他的一生更换过很多职业。
    萧洛霍夫的母亲是个没有受过教育的女人。但是当自己的儿子离家去读书以后，为了自己能给儿子写信，才开始学习识字。
    萧洛霍夫读书读到一九一八年，当国内战争开始的时候，他为了参加革命的哥萨克队伍进行斗争，离开了中学。这个时候萧洛霍夫才十三岁。
    过了两年，他在乡村里组织了第一个共产主义青年团小组，和反革命的匪帮进行了斗争，这是他最艰难的时期。萧洛霍夫对于这个时期曾有一段这样的回忆：“我们追逐着统治顿河的匪徒们，匪徒们也追赶着我们，就这样地追来追去，那时候的情况很是复杂”。
    在顿河上的反革命匪徒们被击溃以后，萧洛霍夫曾做过石匠、挑夫和教员等工作。
    萧洛霍夫从一九二三年起才开始写作，他的初期短篇小说也就在那年发表的。
    他的工作是在很艰难的情况下进行的，他的房子异常狭窄，并且经常还要为着挣钱而操心。
    他的友人和亲属对于他的力量，他的创作能力表示怀疑，都嘲笑他对文学的热中。
    在他童年的时候，他的父亲曾鼓励他多看书籍，可是现在却为了他对文学的勤奋而感觉苦恼，他的父亲引证各种理由来说明，他不能成为一个真正的作家。但是过了两年，他的初期作品两部小说却出版了。
    萧洛霍夫开始写的和以后继续写的都是关于顿河上哥萨克的生活，因为关于哥萨克生活他比别人知道得更多。
    萧洛霍夫认为真实性是艺术的基本法则，他就立志去描写真实的生活，有什么写什么，不加任何的修饰。
    萧洛霍夫在他最初的几个短篇小说里写的是，在国内战争中顿河上的事件。
    顿河上的苏维埃政权，是在激烈的战斗中宣告成立的，这战斗在萧洛霍夫的记忆里留下了不可磨灭的印象，于是，他便在这里找到了自己作品的题材。
    萧洛霍夫老老实实地描绘出了顿河哥萨克中间的尖锐的阶级斗争。
    在他那些初期的短篇小说中，他已经善于技巧地、正确地来描绘敌人的典型了。这些敌人曾以凶狠恶意守护着自己苛毒的权利。他描写出无情的、无人性的反革命者，他描写出富农凶狠地施之于贫农领袖的报复。
    在《死敌》这个短篇小说里，富农们要谋害叶菲木，因为叶菲木曾经积极地为巩固苏维埃政权而斗争，他是革命哥萨克的领导者。
    可是萧洛霍夫所描述的敌人的凶恶仇恨，是一种绝望的仇恨，是一种软弱无力的仇恨，是一种不能在社会上继续生存的人们的仇恨。
    村苏维埃书记叶菲木知道敌人可能要谋害他，他的朋友们对于这一点也知道，但是他的朋友们向他说：“叶菲木！你要记住！假若他们谋害了你，那末就会有二十个新叶菲木产生出来，你明白吗？就好像故事里面的英雄似的，一个被害死以后，就产生出两个来”。
    萧洛霍夫特别注意于描写哥萨克家庭中由阶级斗争所引起的亲属不睦的情形。
    “仿佛是谁掘了一道鸿沟把人们划分成两个敌对营垒似的”。
    萧洛霍夫连家庭的冲突，都用阶级斗争的规律来解释，他所描述的家庭里双方敌对的斗争，达到了特别尖锐的形式。
    在为私有财产和土地的斗争中，身为富农的父亲同他的长子杀害了自己的幼子——一个共产主义青年团团员。
    一个白卫军军官枪毙了撤退时被俘的父亲和兄弟。
    一个匪帮头目在战斗中杀害了自己的儿子，因为他的儿子是赤卫军指挥官。
    在多次流血和残酷的战斗里产生了新的生活。
    但是，萧洛霍夫在这种残酷无情的战斗里却善于发现一个人的优秀品质，善于描写具有这些优秀品质的人们——共产党员们。
    萧洛霍夫的短篇小说充满了对于人的信仰。这些短篇小说描述着在最艰难的情况中所表现的人的崇高，这种人，为了自己所负的职务准备供献出一切，为了拯救别人情愿牺牲自己的生命。共产党员巴嘉根在途中碰到了一个冻僵的男孩子，他把他放到自己的马上，而白卫军却在后面追赶着他们，但是他不能把这个男孩子丢掉，他把自己的马给这个男孩子，而他虽然明知面对着死亡，却仍然留在那里。叶菲木也是属于这样的典型人物。
    在和富农的斗争里，他并不恐惧，也不怕有人从窗外射击他。他忠实于自己的事业，并且为事业而战斗到底。
    萧洛霍夫初期的短篇小说，是他未来长篇小说《静静的顿河》和《被开垦的处女地》的序言。这两部长篇小说给萧洛霍夫带来了成为“苏联优秀作家之一”的荣誉。
    《静静的顿河》他写了十四年。他在里面描述了革命前和革命后的哥萨克生活、风俗的特点，阶级仇恨的尖锐化，以及哥萨克走向革命所经过的困苦艰难的道路。
    《静静的顿河》是顿河上的国内战争的历史，是逐步克服敌人凶暴的抗争而建立起顿河上新生活的历史。
    《静静的顿河》这部小说，给读者创造了一个关于巨大人民运动的完整的表象，这运动摧毁了前进路上的一切阻障。
    《静静的顿河》这部小说，有完全理由可以称作顿河上哥萨克生活的百科全书。
    这部小说在读者面前呈现出哥萨克的一切生活特点。哥萨克是一种农民，是一种特殊类型的农民——具有战士性格的农民。他们从小就准备训练成为捍卫祖国的荣誉角色，当他们还是孩童的时候，就被训练着使用武器和骑马。哥萨克人代代相承的传统，英勇和刚毅，不怕死和爱国主义，在哥萨克人中间发展着。
    哥萨克的歌曲是颂扬军事服役和军事功勋的。哥萨克的军事上的英勇，是从与专制政权作长期斗争中锻炼出来的。专制政权曾经多次地企图使哥萨克低头，但是没有获得成功。后来专制政权又使用另外一种方式：给予哥萨克以许多特权，并且授意他们要有同族团结的思想。
    专制当局曾以全力和各种方法，迫使哥萨克人信服他们，让哥萨克人认为自己在血统上要比俄罗斯农民高贵，他们努力想把哥萨克变成反动力量的支柱。由于这些事情，哥萨克曾以自己特别途径走向革命。因此阶级冲突在当时哥萨克当中特别厉害。哥萨克群众最后过渡到社会主义方面的这一过程是长久而艰苦的。
    萧洛霍夫在《静静的顿河》里，也描写出了这个过程的复杂性，他指出了在哥萨克中所经历的斗争和最后的踌躇不定的情形，哥萨克人最后终于决定把自己的生活和社会主义祖国的生活永久联结在一起。
    《静静的顿河》不能仅仅看作哥萨克生活的史诗，萧洛霍夫这本书的主题是远为广阔。他以这本书的主要人物米里霍夫写出了一个人的悲惨道路，这个人背离了自己的人民，毁灭了自己的一生。
    一个人无论他具有怎样的长处，假若他和自己的人民脱离的话，假若他不和自己的祖国走向同一方向的话，假如他不为祖国在平时参加劳动在战时建立功勋而进行斗争的话，那么人们就不能给他以帮助。脱离人民就是走向死亡。萧洛霍夫所描写的米里霍夫，就是这一种人的典型。
    萧洛霍夫在长篇小说《被开垦的处女地》里，指出哥萨克的基本群众在最后终于走上了社会主义的道路。在这部长篇小说里描写着跟农村中剥削阶级的最后的决定性的战斗。这是一部关于顿河上哥萨克劳动者过渡到社会主义道路上的小说。
    这部小说，就它对于苏联文学的特性来讲，乃在于它完全与事实有着紧密的联系。这在萧洛霍夫所著的《被开垦的处女地》中表现得特别显明。
    作品的主要构思决定着作品的全盘结构。情节不是和个别英雄的命运相连系，而是和国家的社会政治历史相连系。所以，这部小说的情节，是符合联共（布）党中央委员会关于农业全面集体化和消灭富农之为阶级的决议的。工人达维多夫就是和这个决议相连结而出现的，他是集体农场的组织者。这一决议同样也引起了白党匪徒波洛甫切夫的出现，他联合了所有的富农，领导他们作反革命的骚扰。
    如果联共（布）党中央委员会关于农业全面集体化的决议，就是《被开垦的处女地》这部长篇小说中所写事件的发展开端的话，那末斯大林同志一九三○年三月在报纸上所发表的《胜利冲昏了头脑》这篇论文，就决定了这事件继续发展的道路。
    波洛甫切夫的反革命计划，在这篇论文的影响之下，遭受了失败。
    被波洛甫切夫所诱惑的哥萨克人，读了登载斯大林同志论文的报纸以后，就都拒绝支持波洛甫切夫了。一个哥萨克对波洛甫切夫声明：“我们和你们所走的不是一条道路，既然主人保护着我们，我们何必要跑上另一条道路？”
    这部长篇小说的全部内容，以及事件的经过和发展，都与国内的历史事件相关连，都与具体的政治事实相关连。
    萧洛霍夫根据具体的历史契机，写出了农村中新型人物的增长和阶级敌人的绝望的反抗。
    萧洛霍夫以非常巧妙的手法来描写贫农，他们只有在苏维埃政权之下，才能完全自由呼吸。他还善于描写中农，虽然中农也曾有过极大的动摇，但是终于完全转向到了农业集体化方面。
    我们读了这篇小说，就会感觉到在新的农村生活里，推动一切的基础就是党的组织。
    萧洛霍夫笔下的英雄，是朴实的普通人们，是参加劳动的人们，劳动给予他们以欢乐和生活的意义。只有特殊的事件，只有外来的强制力才能使他们和劳动脱离，他们的生活基础就是劳动。
    萧洛霍夫，这位真理的作家，就这样地描写了每天在进行劳作的英雄们。
    萧洛霍夫笔下的英雄们，从来不谈论自己。在他们完成自己的劳动伟业比谈论自己还更容易。他们虽不吐露爱国的言论，但是作家却很清楚地看到他们的行动，这些人们才是真正的爱国者。他们可以死，但决不背叛人民，决不背叛党和祖国。
    萧洛霍夫拿敌人阵营里的人们——农村里的富农，来和这些具有新性格新道德的人们作比较。他表现出了敌人恶毒的心意，引起读者对于他们的憎恨。
    萧洛霍夫的声音，就是劳动人民的声音。这些劳动人民，就是在平时完成令人惊讶的劳动功绩，在战时挺起胸膛保卫自己祖国的人们。
    萧洛霍夫在战争时期写了一个叫做《憎恨的科学》的短篇小说。德国军队所表现的集体性的兽行，竟达到了全世界以及我们的国家都没有想到的那么残酷的程度。
    敌人的残酷和无人性的目的，在所有苏联爱国者的心里，引起了不共戴天的憎恨。
    萧洛霍夫所著的《憎恨的科学》，写出对法西斯德国侵略者仇恨的增长。这篇小说，揭露了爱好和平的仁慈的俄罗斯人，在内心中憎恨的产生和巩固的真实情形。
    这篇小说的主角是格拉西莫夫中士。
    战前他在工厂里作技师。他是个善良的家长，忠实的同志，优秀的共产党员。他知道在这次战争里所遇到的是强大而残酷的敌人，但是他没有预料到法西斯的卑劣竟达到不可想像的程度。
    格拉西莫夫说：“凭良心讲，我根本就没有期待过敌人的特别诚实，和法西斯交往还有什么诚实可言，但是我真没想到我的敌人竟是这样的德国军队——无耻的败类”。
    格拉西莫夫在战争中看到了很多事情：敌人把整个农村烧得片瓦不留，枪杀老年人和儿童，惨害被俘的红军战士，以及凶狠地杀害妇人和女孩等等。
    他看见了：连大自然也被希特勒野蛮士兵给污辱了，他们把树木看作是一个绞刑架，把小溪潺潺流过的山谷看作是被他们谋害和枪杀者的天然坟墓。
    格拉西莫夫中士经历了作俘虏的艰苦道路，他理解了敌人的目的是要消灭俄罗斯民族，所以格拉西莫夫的心理充满了对敌人的憎恨。
    萧洛霍夫所著的这个短篇小说，教导着人们对敌人的憎恨和对祖国的热爱。对敌人的憎恨和对祖国的热爱是爱国主义最有力的表现。对敌人的憎恨和对祖国的热爱是走向胜利的正确道路。
    这就是萧洛霍夫所著的短篇小说《憎恨的科学》的中心思想。
    现在萧洛霍夫正在写着一部长篇小说，这部小说主题写的是苏联人民反对德国侵略者的伟大卫国战争。这部小说的名字叫做《他们为祖国而战》，这部小说现在还没有写完。萧洛霍夫喜欢把自己的著作加以长久而仔细的修改。这部小说的各章已经分别的刊出了。其中描写着苏联战士们以自己的胸膛遮蔽住敌人的机枪口，腰上系着手榴弹躺在敌人的坦克车下，驾驶飞机对敌人作肉弹的冲击等等英勇事迹。
    这本书叙述着苏联战士们不仅表现出自己的坚强力量，而且还代表着自己人民的力量，自己党的力量。
    这本书充满了真理必能获胜的信念，他证实了莫洛托夫同志所说的话：“我们的事业是具有真理的，敌人一定能被击溃，胜利必将属于我们”。
    无论德国人怎样地散布着死亡和破坏，荣耀的人民所具有的生存意志，是不能被战胜的。
    萧洛霍夫在战后写了《关于祖国的话》，他说我们对于敌人的憎恨不可淡漠下去，并且更应百倍地增强对于新战争准备者的憎恨，每个诚实的人都应该咒骂他们的名字。
    自苏维埃政权成立以来，苏维埃国家无论是在战争中或在克服任何困难中，从来没有遭受过失败。
    我们的党是伟大而强有力的，它能够把人民组织、教育、武装起来，并且领导他们完成历史上空前未有的伟大事业。
    这伟大而不可战胜的人民，不仅能保卫自己祖国的独立和击溃所有的敌人，并且已经成为全世界劳动人民唯一的希望的明灯。
