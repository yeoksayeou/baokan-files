How Huangjia Village Overcame the Spring Famine
    Liu Yun
    Under the active leadership of village cadres such as Feng Shouting, the village director, Zhao Xingzhi, the farmer representative, and Wan Qinglian, the women's representative, the masses of Huangjia Village, Sixth Township, Ninth District (suburban area of Xi'an City), launched lending and organized work exchange, successfully overcoming the difficulties of the spring famine and are now turning to active production.
    The village has a total of 163 households with 674 people, including 2 rich peasant households, 6 well-to-do middle peasant households, 20 middle peasant households, and about 50 poor peasant households with only 190 mu of land. The remaining 80 or so households are shoulder-pole peddlers with nothing. Due to the long-term oppression by the Kuomintang reactionaries before liberation, the vast majority of the masses were in poverty. During the New Year, three households were already unable to make ends meet, and the village cadres helped them borrow some grain to barely get through the holiday. But since the Spring Festival, the spring famine has gradually worsened.
    In early March, the village cadres went to the municipal government to listen to Vice Mayor Fang's report on production and disaster relief. They were inspired and gained confidence in overcoming the spring famine. In particular, after village director Feng Shouting and farmer representative Zhao Xingzhi returned to the village, they promoted the policy of production for self-relief everywhere and quickly established the Production and Disaster Relief Committee (including 3 well-to-do middle peasants, 7 middle peasants, and 2 poor peasants).
    After the organization was established, the first thing discussed was how to open the door for free lending. Many committee members said, "There are still many people who don't understand the policy and are afraid of being labeled and struggled against. Therefore, in addition to good publicity, the most important thing is for our committee members to take the lead and show them a model." At the first meeting of the committee, eight committee members took the lead in signing up to lend a total of five shi and two dou of grain. After the meeting, the committee members promoted the idea and another ten households responded positively, lending another four shi and two dou.
    Immediately afterwards, a mass meeting was held to discuss how to develop production, emphasizing that "only production for self-relief can overcome the spring famine, and we must resolutely oppose dependence." As a result, under the collective supervision of the masses, only five households with special difficulties registered, asking to borrow grain. After evaluation, a total of two shi and five dou of coarse grains were lent to the five households. The masses who received the grain were particularly enthusiastic about production. Qu Laiqing, after borrowing six dou of wheat, actively pushed the mill and sold flour every day, and his life has gradually improved. Zhao Shengfa originally had a leg disease and it was very inconvenient to move around. Since borrowing four dou of lentil wheat, he has been carrying urine three times a day to the city (ordinary people can carry it five times), and has now watered more than one mu of lettuce. Farmer representative Zhao Xingzhi said, "Free lending in Huangjia Village has now begun, unlike in the past, when people were afraid of this and that."
    While carrying out free lending, the village cadres also vigorously promoted and organized 36 male laborers to participate in the work exchange team. They were divided into four groups, and the group leader was like a "rooster," waking everyone up at dawn to exchange work for carrying urine to sprinkle wheat fields, watering lettuce, or exchanging work for watering fields. In the past, lettuce was only watered twice with urine, but this year, because a work exchange team was organized, all 20 mu of lettuce in the village were watered three times (each mu requires 30 loads each time), and all the wheat fields were sprinkled once with urine. Village chief Wan Yuting said, "Not only is the lettuce growing better than elsewhere, but the wheat fields in our village that have been sprinkled with urine are growing particularly vigorously."
    In the past, women never participated in production. Even if the cabbage grew too tall, they were ashamed to go out and pinch it. But after women's representative Wan Qinglian attended the "March 8th" Women's Congress in the district, she and other village cadres launched a widespread campaign: "Now that Chairman Mao has come, it is most glorious to participate in production, and it is most shameful not to produce." Therefore, the women's understanding was raised, and 30 women were organized into four groups on a voluntary basis. First, they replaced the men in weeding wheat, allowing the men to take the time to carry more urine to the city (30 women can replace at least 15 male laborers, and each man carries urine five times a day, carrying a total of 75 loads a day, which can sprinkle more than four mu of wheat fields), and weeded all 20 mu of lettuce in the village. While weeding wheat or when they were free, they also actively dug wild vegetables. For example, in addition to supplying her family with seven or eight jin of wild vegetables every day, Wan Qinglian also earned more than 30,000 yuan selling vegetables. The women have also sewn 2,200 hatbands for the factory (each hundred hatbands earns one unit of wages). Now, it has become a common and ordinary phenomenon for women to help men start (dig) manure, feed livestock, and grind flour. Currently, a literacy group for women is being organized on the basis of the work exchange team, and more than 30 people have signed up to participate.
    Recently, the Municipal Production and Disaster Relief Committee also lent 25 bags of flour to nine households in the village in the form of small loans. They are now preparing to repair a waterwheel and dig five new wells, which are estimated to turn more than 11 mu of dry land into paddy fields. As a result, farmer representative Zhao Xingzhi and other cadres are expressing with certainty: "The spring famine in our Huangjia Village has passed. The problem now is how to think of more ways to organize the male and female labor forces and engage in vigorous production."
    How did Huangjia Village achieve such results? The main reasons are the following:
    (1) Political power is in the hands of the basic masses, and all the cadres in the village are upright people from suffering backgrounds.
    (2) Party members and League members played a promoting role. Whenever the district or township assigned work, the meetings of Party members and League members were held first, and then cadres' meetings or mass meetings were held to convey the information.
    (3) The cadres are as united as one person. There is no disunity or favoritism in their work. In particular, farmer representative Zhao Xingzhi pays attention to democracy in his leadership methods. Whenever he does a job, he always consults with everyone repeatedly. Therefore, once a job is decided, everyone actively completes it.

### 黄家庄怎样战胜春荒？

　　黄家庄怎样战胜春荒？
    刘云
    西安市（市郊）九区六乡黄家庄群众在村主任冯寿亭、农民代表赵兴智、妇女代表万青莲等村干部积极领导下展开借贷，组织变工，顺利的克服了春荒的困难，目前正转入积极生产。
    该村共一百六十三户，六百七十四人，其中富农二户、富裕中农六户、中农二十户，而贫农五十来户仅有土地一百九十亩，其余八十来户是一无所有的肩挑小贩。由于解放前国民党反动派长年的压榨，绝大多数群众处于穷困状况。过年时有三户已经揭不开锅，村干部帮助他们借了些粮食才勉强过了年。但自春节以来春荒逐渐严重。
    三月初村干部到市政府听方副市长生产救灾的报告，得到启发，有了克服春荒的信心。尤其是村主任冯寿亭与农民代表赵兴智回村后，到处宣传生产自救的方针，并很快将生产救灾委员会成立起来（其中包括三户富裕中农，七户中农，二户贫农）。
    组织建立后，首先讨论的是如何打开自由借贷的门。许多委员们说：“现在还有很多人对政策不了解，怕抬高成份怕斗争。所以除了好好的进行宣传外，最重要的还是要我们委员起带头作用，拿出模范的样子叫他们看看。”在首次委员会上委员们带头自动报名出借的有八户，共借出五石二斗粮食，会后又经各委员分头宣传，前后有十户群众积极影应，又借出四石二斗。
    随即召开群众大会，讨论如何开展生产，强调提出：“只有生产自救才能渡过春荒，坚决反对依赖思想。”结果在群众集体监督下，只有特别困难的五户报了名，要求借粮。评议结果，计共借给该五户二石五斗杂粮。得到借粮的群众生产情绪特别高涨。曲来庆借到六斗麦以后，整天积极的推磨卖面，生活已逐渐好转。赵生发本来腿上有疾，走动非常不便，自借到四斗扁豆麦以后，每天也去城里担三次尿（平常人可担五次），现在已浇完了一亩多莴苣。农民代表赵兴智谈：“黄家庄的自由借贷现在已经开始了，不像过去，又怕这，又怕那了。”
    开展自由借贷的同时，村干部又深入宣传组织了三十六名男劳力，参加换工队。共分成四组，组长就好比“叫明鸡”，天一亮就把大家叫起来，变工挑尿泼麦地，灌莴苣，或变工浇地。过去莴苣只灌两遍尿，今年因组织起换工队把全村二十余亩莴苣都灌了三遍（每亩每遍需灌三十担），麦地里亦全部泼了一遍尿。村长万玉亭说：“不光是莴苣要比别的地方长的好，我们村里泼过尿的这些麦地已经长的特别旺了。”
    妇女们在过去从来不参加生产，连白菜出了顶（起了苔）出去捏一捏都嫌羞。但这次妇女代表万青莲参加过区上的“三八”节妇女会回来以后，便和其他村干部展开了普遍宣传：“现在毛主席来了，参加生产最光荣，不生产倒是最丢人的。”因此，提高了妇女的认识，在自愿的原则下，共组织起三十人，编了四个小组。首先代替男人锄麦，使男人们抽出时间去城里多担几回尿（按三十个妇女最少可顶十五个男劳力，男子每人每天担五次尿，每天共担七十五担尿可泼麦地四亩多），并将全村二十余亩莴苣锄了一遍。在锄麦或空时还积极挖地菜，如万青莲除每天供给全家七八斤地菜外，卖菜还赚了三万多元。妇女们还给工厂缝了二千二百个帽带（每百个帽带工资为一个单位）。现在妇女们帮助男人们起（掏）粪、喂牲口、磨面等生产已成了普遍而平常的现象。目前正在换工队的基础上组织妇女识字组，报名参加者，已有三十余人。
    最近市生产救灾委员会又以小本借款方式借给该村九户群众二十五袋面粉。现正准备修理一架水车，并新打五个井，估计可将十一亩多旱地变成水地。由此农民代表赵兴智和其他干部都是以肯定的口气这样表示：“我们黄家庄的春荒已过去了，现在的问题是如何多想些办法把男女劳动力都组织起来，大闹生产。”
    黄家庄怎样得到这样成绩呢？主要因为有以下几点：
    （一）政权掌握在基本群众手里，全村的干部都是受苦出身的正派人。
    （二）党团员起了推动作用。每逢区里或乡里布置下来工作，都是先开党团员会议，然后召开干部会或群众大会进行传达。
    （三）干部之间团结的像一个人，工作中没有闹不团结，或要私情等现象。尤其是农民代表赵兴智在领导方法上很讲究民主，每作一件工作总是三番五次的找大家来商量，因此每件工作一经决定，大家都是积极的去完成。
