　　Beijing Retail Company, in order to standardize food processing and achieve the goals of supporting production and benefiting both public and private sectors, has selected processing households that are relatively well-established, have complete equipment, and are suitably located. After obtaining their consent, processing cooperation contracts were signed. The processing households convert their houses and all equipment into eight to nine shares, while the retail company provides raw materials and guarantees the sale of finished products, converting these into one to two shares, and sends one person to participate as deputy manager to jointly operate the business. Currently, there are seven cooperative processing households. Under the leadership of the company, not only has the processing technology improved compared to the past, but the quality of finished products has also increased, and production has developed. For example, Yong Yu Yuan, a processing household in the Fourth District, has seen a significant improvement in the quality of buckwheat flour processed since cooperating with the company. Public feedback has been positive, and sales have increased significantly compared to the past. Currently, many processing households are also actively requesting to sign cooperative contracts with the company, and the retail company is currently reviewing these requests.
