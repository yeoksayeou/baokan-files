　　Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 27th: TASS reports: Representatives of various progressive groups began an overnight petition demonstration outside the White House on the 24th. They declared that they would continue to demonstrate until the government and Congress implemented the civil rights bill that had long been promised.

　　The demonstrators included representatives from the Progressive Party, labor unions, cultural groups, and religious organizations. They held up placards condemning Truman for breaking his campaign promises, pointing out that the "Cold War" policy infringed upon the democratic rights of the American people.

　　Black singer Paul Robeson, former Minnesota Governor Benson, and Congressman Marcantonio, in talks at a press conference, stated that this petition demonstration emphasized that Truman and the Democratic Party had never seriously strived to implement the "Fair Employment" Act, or other civil rights bills. They pointed out that this overnight petition demonstration would expose the government's true motives and help arouse the American people to exert necessary pressure on Congress.

　　The Progressive Party also distributed a written statement to the press, pointing out that Democratic and Republican members of Congress "refuse to guarantee black people and minorities equal employment opportunities, and they have consistently and shamelessly mocked those solemn promises in their party's campaign platforms."

　　美国人民在白宫外通宵示威
    要求政府实施民权法案
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社华盛顿讯：属于各种进步团体的代表们于二十四日开始在白宫外举行通宵的请愿示威。他们声明：他们要继续示威，直到政府和国会实施久已保证要实施的民权法案为止。
    示威游行者之中包括进步党的、工会的、文化团体和宗教团体的代表们。他们高举着标语牌，谴责杜鲁门违背竞选诺言，指出“冷战”政策侵犯美国人民的民主权利。
    黑人歌唱家罗伯逊、前明尼苏达州州长宾逊和国会议员马肯托尼奥，在记者招待会中发表谈话称：这次请愿示威强调指出杜鲁门和民主党从来不曾认真地争取实施“公平就业”法案，或其他民权法案。他们指出：这种通宵的请愿示威，会把政府的真正动机暴露出来，而有助于唤起美国人民对国会加以必要的压力。
    进步党也对报界散发书面谈话，指出民主党和共和的国会议员们“拒绝保证黑人以及少数民族享受同等的工作机会，他们一贯地、无耻地嘲弄他们的政党竞选纲领上的那些庄严诺言”。
