　　Trade Union Leaders Guide Workers in All Departments to Sign Guarantee Conditions with the Administration
    Production Plans are Successfully Completed
    [Our Newspaper] Workers in all units under the Harbin Railway Bureau, under the leadership of the trade union, universally signed guarantee conditions with the administrative departments in April, improving work efficiency, reducing accidents, and successfully completing production plans, laying the foundation for the signing of collective contracts. Workers at the Harbin Vehicle Inspection Depot launched a widespread signature campaign to completely eliminate accidents. Under the leadership of the trade union, they signed guarantee conditions with the administrative side, and to date, there have been no accidents in the entire depot. Workers at the Sankeshu Electrical Section signed guarantee conditions with the administration in March, and work efficiency improved significantly. In April, they further signed a collective contract with the administration, completing the entire month's task five days ahead of schedule. In terms of communications, they exceeded the task by 35 percent. In terms of maintenance and engineering, they eliminated overtime, downtime waiting for materials, rework waste, and other phenomena. Within the jurisdiction of the Jiamusi Branch Bureau, accidents were reduced by two-thirds in April compared to the past. The vehicle inspection depot, with the exception of the machinery, general affairs, and materials units, were all approved as "Iron Ox Team" members.
    The experience of the Harbin Railway Bureau proves that leading workers to mutually sign guarantee conditions with the administrative side is one of the powerful methods for trade unions to focus on production and ensure the completion of production tasks. It also lays a favorable foundation for the implementation of collective contracts. To achieve this goal, the production plan formulated by the administration must first be handed over to the masses for full discussion, so that workers can clearly understand the production goals and actively propose opinions on improving the production plan. Each trade union group should formulate its own guarantee conditions in accordance with the entire production plan, and the administrative side should also propose guarantee conditions. Both sides should also conduct regular inspections during implementation, and promptly correct deviations and solve problems.

　　哈尔滨铁路管理局
　　工会领导各部门工人与行政上订保证条件
    生产计划得以胜利完成
    【本报讯】哈尔滨铁路管理局所属各单位工人，在工会领导之下，于四月份普遍与行政部门订立保证条件，提高了工作效率，减少了事故，生产计划得以胜利完成，并为订立集体合同打下基础。哈尔滨检车段工友为彻底消灭事故，普遍发起消灭事故的签名运动。并在工会领导下，与行政方面订立保证条件，迄今全段已无事故。三棵树电务段工友在三月份与行政上订立了保证条件，工作效率显著提高。四月份更与行政订立集体合同，提前五天完成全月任务。在通讯方面超过任务百分之三十五，在维修及工程方面消灭了加班加点、停工待料、反工浪费等现象。佳木斯分局管内，四月份事故较前减少三分之二，该检车段除机械、总务、材料三个单位外，其余均被批准为铁牛队员。
    哈尔滨路局的经验证明：领导工人与行政方面互相订立保证条件，是工会面向生产，保证完成生产任务的有力方法之一。也给推行集体合同打下了有利基础。为实现这一目的，必须首先把行政上制订的生产计划交给群众充分讨论，使工人明确生产目标，积极提出改进生产计划的意见。由各工会小组按照整个生产计划，制订自己的保证条件，同时行政方面亦应提出保证条件。双方在执行中并应随时检查，及时纠正偏向和解决问题。
