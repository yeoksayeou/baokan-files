Resolutely Abolish the Ba Tou System

Following the issuance of the "Order on Abolishing the Ba Tou System" by the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government on March 21st, state-owned coal mines in various regions have successively launched a struggle to abolish the Ba Tou system. This indicates that the management personnel of state-owned coal mines in various regions have attached importance to this major issue concerning national coal production and the lives of millions of miners, which is very good. It is hoped that all regions will conscientiously grasp the spirit of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Fuel Industry's order and implement this policy cautiously and resolutely.

Why haven't the Ba Tou system been abolished, or not completely abolished, in some coal mines that have been liberated for a year or two, or even three years? The main reason lies in the ideology and work style of certain leading cadres. Some leading personnel in coal mines lack or have very vague class viewpoints. Some people say, "Workers can't handle coal mine affairs, they can't take them up!" They do not believe in the strength and wisdom of the workers; they do not understand the truth that only by relying on the working class can production be improved. Some people do not understand the essential difference between Ba Tou and workers, and regard Ba Tou as "technical workers." These leading cadres generally want to improve production, but due to ideological errors, they intentionally or unintentionally rely on the Ba Tou, so that the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers cannot be brought into play. In addition, some coal mine leading personnel are ideologically opposed to the Ba Tou system, but because they have serious bureaucratic and formalistic work styles, they are satisfied when they see that the names of "Ba Tou" and "contracting counters" in the mines have been cancelled. However, some Ba Tou, although nominally becoming "group leaders" or "team leaders," or even becoming "Communist Party members," are still feudal forces and continue to exploit and rule the workers. They did not see these facts. This is because they do not go deep into the masses, do not understand the actual situation of production, they are surrounded by these old Ba Tou who have changed their appearance, they cannot see the suffering of the workers, they cannot hear the voices of the workers, that is to say, they are isolated from the worker masses. It should be pointed out that some coal mine management personnel have attempted to seriously abolish the Ba Tou system. However, when they thought, "What will happen to production if they are removed? How will the tasks be completed?" They compromised, and the Ba Tou system was preserved again.

Whether to abolish the Ba Tou system is a fundamental question of either relying on the working class to manage enterprises or relying on feudal remnants to manage enterprises. In fact, wherever the Ba Tou system has been truly abolished, the workers have established a sense of ownership, their production enthusiasm has soared unprecedentedly, and the entire mine has taken on a new look. This is not only the case in the old areas, but also in the new areas. The Tianfu Mine in Sichuan increased its daily coal production from 1,000 tons to 1,500 tons after abolishing the Ba Tou system, which is a powerful illustration.

Abolishing the Ba Tou system is a democratic revolution in mine management system, and it should be resolutely and unswervingly implemented. In order to implement this revolution, it is necessary to deeply mobilize the workers and turn the "Order on Abolishing the Ba Tou System" into a conscious mass movement of coal mine workers. Any paternalistic substitution and simply relying on administrative orders cannot solve the problem and should therefore be opposed. In the process of the movement, special attention should be paid to cultivating worker activists, and workers with practical production experience and prestige should be boldly promoted to management production positions to replace those Ba Tou who oppress the workers. Only when the workers actually become the masters of the mines can state-owned mines be run well.

### 坚决废除把头制度

　　坚决废除把头制度
    在中央人民政府燃料工业部三月二十一日发布“废除把头制度”的通令后，各地国营煤矿，相继展开了废除把头制度的斗争。这表示各地国营煤矿管理人员，已经重视了这个关系国家煤炭生产与千百万矿工生活的重大问题，这是很好的。希望各地认真掌握中央人民政府燃料部通令的精神，慎重而坚决地把这个方针贯彻下去。
    为什么有些煤矿已经解放了一两年，甚至两三年，把头制度还没有废除，或者没有彻底废除呢？主要的原因，是在于某些领导干部的思想和作风方面。有些煤矿领导人员的阶级观点十分缺乏或十分模糊。有些人说：“煤矿的事情，工人干不了，拿不起来！”他们不相信工人的力量和智慧；不懂得只有依靠工人阶级，才能搞好生产的真理。有些人不了解把头和工人的本质区别，而把把头看成“技术工人”。这些领导干部一般地是想把生产搞好，但由于思想错误，便有意无意地依靠了把头，使工人的积极性和创造性不能发挥。另外，也有些煤矿领导人员，在思想上是反对把头制的，但是由于他们有严重的官僚主义、形式主义作风，他们看见矿上的“把头”、“包工柜”等名义已经取消，就心满意足了。但是有些把头虽然名义上已经成了“大组长”或“班长”，甚至成了“共产党员”，他们仍然是封建势力，仍然继续剥削和统治工人。这些事实，他们却没有看见。这是由于他们不深入群众，不了解生产实际情况，他们被这些改头换面的旧把头所包围，看不见工人的痛苦，听不到工人的呼声，就是说，他们和工人群众隔绝了。应该指出：有些煤矿管理人员，是曾经企图认真废除把头制度的。但是，当着他们想到：“去掉他们，生产怎么办？任务怎样完成呢？”他们就妥协了，把头制度就又被保留下来了。
    是否废除把头制度，乃是一个或者依靠工人阶级管理企业，或者依靠封建残余管理企业的根本问题。事实上，凡是真正废除了把头制度的地方，工人就树立了主人翁思想，生产情绪就空前上涨，整个矿场的面貌就为之一新。这不仅在老区是如此，新区也是一样。四川天府矿废除了把头制，每日产煤量由一千吨增至一千五百吨，就是一个有力的说明。
    废除把头制度，这是矿山管理制度中的民主革命，应当坚决不移地贯彻下去。为了贯彻这个革命，一定要深入发动工人，把“废除把头制度”的通令，变成煤矿工人自觉的群众运动。任何包办代替，单纯依靠行政命令的作法，都是不能解决问题，因而是应该反对的。在运动过程中，要特别注意培养工人积极分子，放手把有实际生产经验与有威信的工人提拔到管理生产的岗位上来，以代替那些压迫工人的把头。只有工人在实际上作了矿山的主人，才能把国营矿山办好。
