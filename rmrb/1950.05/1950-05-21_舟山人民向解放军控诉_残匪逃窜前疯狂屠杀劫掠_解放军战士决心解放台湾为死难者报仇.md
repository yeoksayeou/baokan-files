Xinhua News Agency, Zhoushan Front, 20th: Before their disgraceful escape, the remnant bandits in Zhoushan frantically massacred the people and engaged in large-scale looting and destruction. The day before their escape, the bandit troops blew up the wharf in Dinghai and looted many shops in the city. A large number of young people, adults, and even old people and children on the island were captured by the bandit troops; more than 60 people were captured from the third Bao of Linggang Town on Zhoushan Island alone. The bandit troops used machine guns to shoot or bayonets to stab people who did not want to be taken to Taiwan. On the roads where the bandit troops fled, there were corpses covered in blood and gore everywhere. When the People's Liberation Army entered Linggang Town, the women and children in the town were crying everywhere. The people of all villages, who had been longing for liberation for a long time, surrounded the People's Liberation Army as soon as they saw them, to accuse the bandit troops of their crimes. Everywhere the People's Liberation Army passed, women blocked the road and cried, some holding the clothes of their sons who had been killed by the bandits, following the People's Liberation Army, crying and demanding that the People's Liberation Army avenge them. Seeing the barbaric crimes of the Kuomintang remnant bandits, the PLA fighters were extremely indignant and said, "We must liberate Taiwan and avenge our dead compatriots!"

　　舟山人民向解放军控诉
    残匪逃窜前疯狂屠杀劫掠   
    解放军战士决心解放台湾为死难者报仇
    【新华社舟山前线二十日电】舟山残匪在狼狈逃窜前曾疯狂地屠杀人民，并大肆劫掠和破坏。匪军在逃走前一天，炸毁了定海的码头，将城内许多店铺抢劫一空。岛上大批青年、壮年甚至老人小孩都被匪军抓走，仅舟山本岛上岭港镇第三保即被抓走六十多人。匪军将不愿被抓去台湾的人民，用机枪射死，或用刺刀刺杀。在匪军逃跑所经过的路上，到处有被杀害的血肉模糊的尸体。当解放军进入岭港镇时，镇上妇女小孩哭声一片。久已渴待解放的各村人民一见解放军来到，就团团围拢来控诉匪军罪行。在解放军经过的地方，随处都有女人们拦路哭诉，有的手里拿着被匪帮杀害了的她们的儿子的衣服，跟着解放军边走边哭，要求解放军给他们报仇。解放军战士们眼看国民党残匪的野蛮罪行，愤慨万分地说：“我们一定要解放台湾，给死难的同胞报仇！”
