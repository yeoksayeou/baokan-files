Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 22nd: State-owned professional companies in the Central and South China region are vigorously helping private enterprises overcome current difficulties such as sluggish sales through methods like ordering, purchasing, and entrusting processing. The Central and South China Department Store Company allocated over 20 billion yuan at the beginning of this month and distributed it to various branches and sub-branches to purchase industrial products. As of the 15th, in Hankou alone, it had purchased over 400 types of products, including matches, soap, towels, socks, and fabrics. At the same time, it entrusted private sewing and printing industries to process over 800 bolts of various colored fabrics and 1,000 boxes of newsprint. The Central and South China Yarn and Cloth Company purchased 7.755 billion yuan worth of products from private manufacturers in April, including 1,672 pieces of cotton yarn and 387 bolts of cotton cloth from Wuhan First Cotton Mill, Yuhua, Shenxin, and Zhenhuan four major cotton mills. In addition, the company lent a total of more than 5,250 dan of cotton to Shenxin, Yuhua, and the First Cotton Mill. From May 1st to 12th, the company also acquired more than 1,000 pieces of cotton yarn from Yuhua and Shenxin factories in Hankou through barter; and signed contracts for weaving and spinning with Wuhan First Cotton Mill, supplying the factory with 10,000 dan of cotton. In April, the Central and South China Coal and Building Materials Company purchased 6,000 tons of firewood coal from private Lihua and Yuanhua coal mines in Daye County, Hubei.

The assistance of state-owned professional companies has played a significant role in helping private enterprises overcome current difficulties. In April, Wuhan First, Shenxin, and Yuhua three major cotton mills faced great difficulties due to poor sales and tight capital turnover. On the one hand, there was a lack of raw materials, and on the other hand, the stored yarn could not be sold. After the state-owned Yarn and Cloth Company purchased cotton yarn and supplied cotton, they were able to continue production. The private Suihua Match Factory produced 110 bundles of matches per day, but the factory faced extreme difficulties due to sluggish sales. After the Central and South China People's Bank, the Hubei Provincial Department of Commerce, and the Central and South China Department Store Company jointly purchased or exchanged more than 3,700 bundles, the factory overcame its difficulties.

　　中南区各专业公司
    开展订货收购加工业务         
    若干私营企业赖以渡过困难
    【新华社汉口二十二日电】中南区国营各专业公司用订货、收购和委托加工等方式，大力帮助私营企业克服目前产品滞销等困难。中南百货区公司本月初调拨资金二百余亿元，分配各分、支公司收购工业产品，截至十五日止，仅在汉口一地即收购了火柴、肥皂、毛巾、袜子、布匹等达四百余种；同时并以各种花色布八百余匹、白报纸一千箱，委托私营缝纫业、印刷业加工。中南花纱布公司四月份收购私营厂商产品达七十七亿五千五百余万元，计收购武汉市第一纱厂、裕华、申新、震寰四大纱厂的棉纱一千六百七十二件，棉布三百八十七匹。此外，该公司并借给申新、裕华及第一纱厂棉花共达五千二百五十余担。自五月一日至十二日止，该公司又以换货方式在汉口向裕华、申新两厂收购棉纱一千余件；与武汉第一纱厂订立了代织、代纺合同，供给该厂棉花一万担。中南煤业建筑器材公司四月份在湖北大冶县收购了私营利华、源华煤矿的柴煤六千吨。
    国营各专业公司的扶助，对私营企业克服目前困难上起了极大作用。武汉市第一、申新、裕华三大纱厂四月份因销路不畅，资金周转不灵，一方面没有原料，一方面存纱卖不出去，感受极大困难；经国营花纱布公司收购棉纱、供给棉花后，始继续维持生产。私营燧华火柴厂日产火柴一百一十篓，因销路呆滞工厂维持极为困难。经中南区人民银行、湖北省商业厅和中南百货公司等共收购或交换达三千七百多篓后，该厂即已渡过困难。
