People's Garden

　　Publish More Revolutionary History Paintings
    Comrade Luo Tianzhu suggests to the editorial staff:
    The "Shangrao Concentration Camp" painted by Comrade Shao Yu, published continuously in People's Garden, powerfully exposes the vicious and hideous face of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and also clearly shows the process through which the victory of the Chinese people's revolution was achieved, and expresses the heroic deeds of revolutionary martyrs. Many people shouted after seeing it: "We must liberate Taiwan, Tibet, and Hainan Island! Arrest the war criminal Chiang Kai-shek, blood debts must be paid in blood, and avenge the soldiers who sacrificed for the revolution!" Revolutionary youths, after seeing it, have further strengthened their revolutionary will, willing to inherit the tradition of the martyrs, carry forward the spirit of hard work and heroism, and strive for China's construction cause. This kind of painting has great educational significance, and readers like to see it very much. I hope that People's Garden will publish more revolutionary history paintings in the future. This is the unanimous request of the majority of readers.
                                    Luo Tianzhu, Propaganda Department of the CPC Wudong County Committee, Suiyuan Province

Comrade Luo Tianzhu:
    We accept your suggestion and will publish as many of these types of paintings as possible. We hope that painters from all over the country will help us fulfill your request.

### 多登革命史画  罗天柱同志向本刊建议

　　多登革命史画
    罗天柱同志向本刊建议编辑同志：
    人民园地连续登载的邵宇同志所绘“上饶集中营”，有力地暴露了国民党反动派毒辣狰狞的面孔，也明显表现了中国人民革命胜利是经过怎样的过程，表现了革命先烈的英勇伟迹，很多群众看了高声大叫：“我们一定要解放台湾、西藏、海南岛！捉拿战争罪犯蒋介石，血债要血还，替为革命牺牲的战士复仇！”革命的青年看了，更坚定了革命意志，愿继承先烈的传统，发扬艰苦英勇精神，为中国的建设事业而努力。这类画稿教育意义很大，读者也都很喜欢看。希望人民园地以后多登载些革命史画，这是广大读者一致的要求。
                                    绥远省武东县中共县委宣传部罗天柱罗天柱同志：
    我们接受你的意见，尽可能多登这一类画稿，希望各地画家们帮助我们实现你的要求。
