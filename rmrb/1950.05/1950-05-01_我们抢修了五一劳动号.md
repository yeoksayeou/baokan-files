　　We Repaired the "May 1st Labor" Tram
　　Tram Repair Factory, Tang Jichun

　　Last year, the Tram Company Repair Factory, in anticipation of the first May Day after the liberation of Beijing, proposed the slogan of producing one hundred trams for May Day and completed the task ahead of schedule. By April 25th, all one hundred trams could be delivered. On April 24th, all the factory workers were very excited, rejoicing over the crystallization of our two months of labor and sweat, and even made a float to celebrate the harvest of our work on the 25th when the trams were delivered. Who knew that the mad-dog-like special agents would set a fire on the night of the 24th, burning down fifty-seven trams. On the morning of the 25th, many workers looked at the burned-out trams, and tears of anger and grief streamed down their faces.

　　The trams were burned, but our strength was not burned away. Many leaders spoke, urging us to turn our anger into strength, redouble our efforts, and produce another hundred trams. We have the confidence to do it—our strength cannot be burned away.

　　For the second "one hundred trams" campaign, we all started working again. There were many difficulties, and many parts were damaged by the fire, requiring us to make them ourselves; but we had never done it before. After everyone's research, we finally overcame various difficulties, and we made the parts and materials that had been required to be bought from abroad for many years ourselves. The most difficult motor core, fire glass sleeve, and large brake box were also successfully researched. In November of last year, we also implemented a responsibility system for conductors on the tram lines, and the failure rate of the trams was greatly reduced.

　　In the year of great production in 1950, thanks to the good coordination of the Communist Party branch, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, our work exceeded 100% of most of the production in 1949. We divided the work among various teams to repair a dilapidated No. 501 tram that had been parked in the yard for more than six years, exposed to wind, sun, and rain, and named it the "May 1st Labor" tram, with calligraphy by Comrade Peng Zhen. In addition, we built four new locomotives to welcome the first May Day after the founding of the People's Republic of China. From May Day in 1949 to May Day this year, we have repaired and built a total of 116 new trams and motor trailers. During this year, a large number of labor models and production heroes emerged in the repair factory. In one year, our work has made great progress, and our People's Liberation Army is also about to completely liberate the task of all of China. Let us celebrate our festival with hard work and developing production, and wish for the liberation of all of China!

　　我们抢修了五一劳动号
    电车修造厂  唐继椿
    去年电车公司修造厂在迎接北京解放后的第一个五一节时，曾提出了在五一节出百辆车的口号，并且提前完成了任务，在四月二十五日可把百辆车全部出厂。四月二十四日，全厂职工都非常兴奋，为我们二月来的劳力血汗结晶而欢欣鼓舞，并且自己做出一辆花车，准备在二十五日出厂来庆祝我们的工作的收获。谁知道，疯狗般的特务竟在二十四日的夜间，放了一把火，烧毁了五十七辆车。二十五日早晨，好多工友望着被烧毁的车，愤恨、痛心得流下泪来。
    车被烧了，但是我们的力量并没有被火烧掉。很多首长讲话，都要我们把愤恨变成力量，再接再励、再干一个百辆车。我们有信心干——我们的力量是烧不掉的。
    第二次百辆车运动，我们大家又着手干起来。困难是很多的，有许多机件被火烧坏，需要我们自己做；但是我们都没有做过；经过大家研究，终于克服了各种困难，多少年来需要到外国去买的零件材料，我们都自己做了出来。最困难的马达心，火玻璃套，大闸盒，也都研究成功。在去年十一月份，我们又实行了车路的乘务负责制，坏车率大大减少了。
    在一九五○年的大生产年中，由于共产党支部、行政、工会及青年团配合得好，我们的工作比一九四九年的生产大部都超过了百分之百。我们把一辆被风吹日晒雨淋了六年多停在院中的五○一号破车，由各班分担工作抢修出来，定名为五一劳动号，由彭真同志题字，另外又造出四辆新机车，来迎接中华人民共和国成立后的第一个五一节。从四九年五一节，到今年五一节，我们连修带造的新车、机拖车共一一六辆。在这一年期中，修造厂涌现出大批劳动模范和生产英雄。一年中我们工作进展很大，我们的人民解放军也快要完全解放了全中国的任务。让我们用努力工作、发展生产来庆祝自己的节日，并预祝全中国解放吧！
