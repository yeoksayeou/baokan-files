　　Youth Service Department and other groups
　　Launch mass signature campaign
　　[Our Newspaper] In response to the signature campaign for the defense of world peace, the Youth Service Department set up a signature table in its hall on the afternoon of the 13th, calling on members, students, and the general youth to sign. In less than two hours, nearly four hundred people signed. The signature campaign is still ongoing. (China Youth News Agency)
　　
Also: All 221 students of the Adult Literacy School of the Beijing No. 3 Cultural Center signed. Even the newly literate students wrote their names crookedly on the paper. The Cultural Center is also preparing to carry out extensive publicity on the 16th to mobilize citizens to sign up enthusiastically. All the students unanimously responded and are willing to be propagandists to mobilize their neighbors to sign. (Third Cultural Center Correspondent Group)
