　　Hebei Province Yinghu峪 Coal Mine
   “Labor Broker” System Persists, Workers Suffer Severe Exploitation
    Mine Manager Repents After Studying "February 7th" Editorial
    [Our Dispatch] Li Yongfu, the manager of the Yinghu峪 Coal Mine in Wu'an, Hebei Province, after studying the "Learn to Manage Enterprises" editorial in a collective study session for industrial and mining cadres in Hebei Province, and with the guidance of leading comrades from the Provincial Department of Industry and the help of other comrades, has examined the serious problem of the mine not relying on the working class and allowing the long-term existence of labor contractor foremen – the "Labor Broker" system – from a class standpoint. The Provincial Department of Industry is about to dispatch strong cadres to the mine to assist in resolving this issue. Since mining began in February 1946, the mine has relied on labor contractor foremen – the "Labor Broker" system – and several pit foremen closely connected with the "Labor Broker" system to manage production. They oppressed, controlled, and exploited workers extremely severely. Last November, the Provincial Department of Industry and the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions Coal Industry Office inspected the mine and exposed the facts of feudal exploitation of workers by the "Labor Broker" system. The workers were then encouraged to wage struggle. The workers settled accounts with five "Labor Broker" outfits. These five "Labor Broker" outfits, in a period of sixty-nine to ninety-eight days, withheld a total of 3,294 catties of rice in wages and food. Among them, Zhao Erlin's outfit immediately returned 515 catties of rice to the workers, and Wang Qingren's outfit returned 451 catties of rice. The remaining three outfits are also in the process of recovering the exploited portions. However, because Manager Li lacked the idea of relying on the working class to manage production, he instead compensated Zhao Erlin with seventy "labor days" in the name of repaying "labor costs," equivalent to 700 catties of rice. Wang Qingren received sixty "labor days," equivalent to 600 catties of rice. This was more than what was compensated to the workers by more than one hundred catties, and he brought the bosses of the three "Labor Broker" outfits to the mine to serve as captains in charge of production, turning them into new, legal controllers. As a result, the workers' lives fell into extreme hardship. Workers' working hours stretched up to twelve to fourteen hours. Some workers slept on the ground. Dormitories had no doors or windows. Over a hundred people shared a single washbasin. The manager never inquired about these matters. On the contrary, he considered rural party members, village cadres, and other workers who were actively involved in production to be troublemakers. In fact, many rural party members, branch secretaries, village cadres, and local trade union members working in the mine actively launched production competitions and performed very well. In the study session, through ideological struggle and education, Li Yongfu realized that this was an act of extreme class ambiguity and betrayal of the fundamental, and expressed his willingness to firmly rely on the working class to lead production under the correct leadership of the higher authorities, to atone for his sins with hard and practical work, and requested the Party and the administration to punish him.

　　河北省营胡峪煤矿
   “寻人铺”长期存在工人受严重剥削
    该矿经理学习“二七”社论后已作反省
    【本报讯】河北省营武安胡峪煤矿经理李永福，在河北省工矿干部集体学习“学会管理企业”社论时，经工业厅领导同志的指示，及同志间的帮助，已对该矿不依靠工人阶级，长期允许包工大柜——“寻人铺”存在的严重问题，从阶级立场上进行了检查。省工业厅即将派遣强有力干部，前往该矿协助处理这个问题。该矿自一九四六年二月开始开采时，即依靠包工大柜——“寻人铺”及与“寻人铺”密切联系的几个窑师来管理生产。他们压迫统制剥削工人极为严重。去年十一月，省府工业厅和省总工会煤业办事处检查出“寻人铺”对工人进行封建剥削的事实，就在工人中予以揭发，并启发工人进行斗争。工人清算了五个“寻人铺”。这五个“寻人铺”在六十九天到九十八天的时间内，克扣工资和伙食共计三千二百九十四斤米。其中赵二林铺当即退还工人五百一十五斤米，王清仁铺退还四百五十一斤米。其余三铺也正在追回剥削部分。但因李经理缺乏依靠工人阶级管理生产的思想，反以偿还“寻人工”的名义，补还赵二林七十个“寻人工”，折七百斤米。王清仁六十个“寻人工”，折六百斤米。较赔偿工人者尚多一百多斤，并把三个“寻人铺”掌柜弄到窑上充当管理生产的大队长，变成新的合法的统制者。工人生活遂陷于极端痛苦的境地。工人生产时间上长达十二小时至十四小时，部分工人在土地上睡觉，宿舍没门窗，百余人用一个脸盆，对于这些事情，经理从不过问。相反对农村党员、村干等积极生产的工人却认为挑皮，实际上，在该矿工作的许多农村党员、支书、村干及地方工会会员，他们自动发动生产竞赛，表现是非常好的。在学习中，经过思想斗争和教育，李永福已认识到这是阶级立场极端模糊的忘本行为，表示愿在上级的正确领导下，坚决依靠工人阶级的领导生产，用艰苦踏实的工作来赎罪，并请求党与行政给予处分。
