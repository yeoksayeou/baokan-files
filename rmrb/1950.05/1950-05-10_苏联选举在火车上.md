　　Soviet Elections on a Train
    Xinhua News Agency and People's Daily Moscow Correspondent Li He
    Editor's Note: The election of deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was successfully completed on March 12 this year. 99.98% of all voters participated in the voting, and the Stalin Party and the non-Party alliance won the unanimous love and support of the voters. Our reporter Li He witnessed the preparatory work of the "Train Election Committee" and the enthusiastic voting of people of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union on the train on March 12 in Siberia. Although we received it later, the scene of voting on the train is still touching to see now.
    We didn't have time to visit Moscow to see the Soviet Supreme Soviet representative elections held every four years. We saw it on the train.
    Along the way from the Far East to Siberia, the walls of the stations are covered with red banners that read: "March 12, 1950, everyone go to vote!"
    On March 12th, the train we were on was speeding across the boundless, snowy Siberian plain. This is the Novosibirsk Oblast, halfway between Atpull, which borders Manchuria, and Moscow, a distance of 6,700 kilometers. The night before, the train election committee, approved by the local government and composed of Galykh Ivan Antonovich, the representative of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union's Taiga Station in Novosibirsk Oblast, and train driver Imiriyanovich, boarded the train. Printed materials containing the portraits and resumes of the candidates for deputies to the Supreme Soviet were hung in each carriage. The candidate for deputy of the Nationalities Soviet was Yeleyemanko Andrey Ivanovich, and the candidate for deputy of the Soviet of the Union was Moskvin Vasily Arsentievich. Yeleyemanko is a famous general who has experienced the Soviet Civil War and the Patriotic War. During the Patriotic War, he commanded the Battle of Stalingrad and later the liberation of Czechoslovakia. He is a Hero of the Soviet Union, a recipient of three Orders of Lenin, four Orders of the Red Banner, three Orders of Suvorov First Class, one Order of Kutuzov First Class, and seven medals. He has also received six orders and six medals from the Polish and Czech governments. Since 1946, he has been the commander of the troops of the West Siberian Military District. He was a representative of the previous Supreme Soviet. Moskvin served as the First Secretary of the Communist Party Committee of Stalinsk City during the Patriotic War and made great contributions to leading coal mining and steel workers in developing production. He was awarded the Order of Lenin, the Order of the Patriotic War First Class, the Order of the Red Star, the Order of Honor, and the Medal for Glorious Labor in the Patriotic War. In 1947, he was elected as a representative of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. The printed materials introducing Yeleyemanko and Moskvin were written in large characters: "Vote for the candidates of the Communist Party and the non-Party alliance!" The Communist Party and the non-Party alliance is a feature of the Soviet elections. Ye and Mo were nominated by collectives of workers, peasants, and soldiers from local factories, mines, farms, machine tractor stations, and troops as candidates of the Communist Party and the non-Party alliance.
    At six o'clock in the morning (local time) on the 12th, the election of deputies to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union began on the train we were on. When we were invited to visit the carriage where the voting was taking place, the corridor of the carriage was already crowded with Soviet citizens of all ethnic groups, both men and women, old and young. They all took their identity cards and lined up one by one to receive their ballots from the election committee to vote. The first voter was Senior Seaman Zhu Chengke Yuri Latin Zhurovich. He participated in the war against Japan and won the Medal for Victory over Japan, the Ushakov Medal, the Nakhimov Medal (Ushakov and Nakhimov were both famous Russian admirals in history), and the Medal for the 30th Anniversary of the Soviet Army. He obtained two ballots from the election committee's room with his identity card: a white one and a light blue one. The former was a ballot for the Soviet of the Union, and the latter was a ballot for the Soviet of Nationalities. The form of the ballot is as follows:
    Ballot for the Supreme Soviet
    March 12, 1950
    Election of the Soviet of Nationalities, Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, District 23, Novosibirsk Oblast
    Please leave the name of the candidate you want to vote for
    and cross out the names of the others
    Name of the candidate, patronymic  Who nominated the candidate
    Yeleyemanko Andrey Ivanovich  Collective of workers, peasants, and soldiers from a certain factory, mine, farm, machine tractor station, or troop in the local area
    Ballot for the Supreme Soviet
    March 12, 1950
    Election of the Soviet of the Union, District 179, Anzhero-Sudzhensk District
    Please leave the name of the candidate you want to vote for and cross out the names of the others
    Name of the candidate, patronymic  Who nominated the candidate
    Moskvin Vasily Arsentievich Collective of workers and peasants from a certain factory, mine, farm, and machine tractor station in the local area
    Zhu Chengke took the ballot, went alone to an empty room next door, closed the door, and conducted a secret and free election: leaving the name of the candidate he approved on the ballot. At this time, no one else was allowed to enter this room, and visitors were no exception. After a while, Zhu Chengke came out, went to another room next door, where there was a ballot box like a mailbox, and put his ballot in through the opening of the box. In this way, he completed the election procedures that every Soviet citizen over the age of eighteen has the right to participate in. More than 400 people on the entire train conducted the election one by one. By 7:30, 190 people had voted; by 8:10, 220 people had voted. An old lady was sick and could not go to the voting car, so the election committee sent someone to bring the ballot to her, let her choose, and then take it away. The voters on the train, undoubtedly like citizens all over the Soviet Union, voted for the candidates of the Communist Party and the non-Party alliance. On the eve of the election, we asked a regiment leader on the same train who he would vote for. He said: The candidates who have been nominated will not be wrong, I will vote for them. The results of the nationwide election announced on March 14 proved that among the 111,116,373 people who participated in the voting, 111,090,010 people, that is, 99.98%, voted for the candidates of the Communist Party and the non-Party alliance headed by Stalin. Yeleyemanko and Moskvin were both elected.
    At lunch on the 12th, the train's dining car was full of beaming Soviet citizens. They said it was a big holiday. They drank heartily. At the table next to us, a sailor pointed to two Soviet people at his table and enthusiastically told us: "I am Russian, he is Moldavian, he is Tatar, we are together like brothers, we have no exploitation of people, we are all the same, voting in the same way!" Fearing that we would not understand, they each stretched out a hand, held them together, and said: "Look, like this, friendly!" Then, the sailor added our hands and held them together, saying: "With the Chinese people, the same, friendly!"
    March 19, Moscow

　　苏联选举在火车上
    新华社及本报驻莫斯科记者  李何
    编者按：苏联最高苏维埃代表的选举，已于今年三月十二日胜利完成。全体选民中参加投票的达百分之九十九·九八，斯大林党与非党联盟获得投票选民的一致的爱戴和拥护。本报记者李何三月十二日在西伯利亚的火车上目睹了“列车选举委员会”的筹备工作和车上苏联各族人民怀着愉快的心情热烈投票的情形。虽然我们收到较迟，但是在列车上投票选举的一幕，现在看了仍然是感人的。
    我们来不及到莫斯科参观四年一度的苏联最高苏维埃代表的选举。我们在火车上看到了它。
    从远东到西伯利亚沿途车站的墙上，到处横挂着这样的红布标语：“一九五○年三月十二日，大家选举去！”
    三月十二日，我们所乘的火车在一望无垠的、雪海一般的西伯利亚平原上奔驰着。这是诺沃西伯利斯克州，正在与满洲里交界的阿特普尔到莫斯科的六千七百公里的中途。前一晚上，由当地政权机关批准的，由联共诺沃西伯利斯克州塔伊加站的组织代表加力赫·伊凡安顿诺维奇和火车司机依米里扬诺维奇等组成的列车选举委员会到了车上。载有最高苏维埃代表候选人肖像和简历的印刷品在每个车厢里挂起来了。民族院代表候选人是叶列孟柯·安得列依·伊凡诺维奇，联邦院代表候选人是莫斯克温·瓦西里·阿尔先捷维奇。叶列孟柯是历经苏联国内战争和卫国战争的名将。在卫国战争中，他指挥过斯大林格勒之战以至后来解放捷克之战。他是苏联英雄，三个列宁勋章，四个红旗勋章，三个一等苏沃洛夫勋章，一个一等辜杜佐夫勋章和七个奖章的获得者。他还受到波兰和捷克政府的六个勋章和六个奖章。从一九四六年起，他是西西伯利亚军区部队指挥官。他是前一届最高苏维埃代表。莫斯克温在卫国战争中曾担任联共斯大林斯克市委第一书记，在领导采煤、制钢工人发展生产方面，贡献很大。他曾获得列宁勋章、一等卫国战争勋章、红星勋章、荣誉勋章和卫国战争中光荣劳动奖章。他于一九四七年被选为俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国最高苏维埃代表。介绍叶列孟柯和莫斯克温的印刷品上大字写道：“投共产党员和非党员联盟的候选人的票吧！”共产党员和非党员联盟，这是苏联选举的特色，叶和莫，就是由当地工厂、矿坑、农场、机器拖拉机站、部队的工、农、兵的集体提名为共产党员和非党员联盟的候选人的。
    十二日早晨六点钟（当地时间），我们所乘的火车上开始了苏联最高苏维埃代表的选举。当我们被邀到投票的车厢上参观的时候，车厢的走廊上已经挤满了男女老少各民族的苏联公民。他们都拿着身份证，一个挨一个地向选举委员会领取选举票进行选举，第一个选举人是海军上等兵朱成柯·犹里拉丁朱罗维奇。他参加过对日作战，曾获得战胜日本奖章，武沙可夫勋章，纳希莫夫勋章（武沙可夫和纳希莫夫都是历史上著名的俄罗斯海军上将），苏军三十周年纪念奖章。他到选举委员会的房间凭身份证取得了两张选举票：白色的和浅蓝色的。前者是联邦院的选举票，后者是民族院的选举票。选举票的形式如下：
    最高苏维埃的选举票
    １９５０年三月十二日
    选举民族院的俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国第２３区诺沃西伯利斯克区
    请您将要选的一个候选人
    姓名留下，去掉其他人姓名
    候选代表的姓名，父名  被谁推举为候选代表
    叶列孟柯·安得列依·伊凡诺维奇  当地某某工厂、矿坑、农场、机器、拖拉机站、部队的工农兵的集体
    最高苏维埃的选举票
    一九五○年三月十二日
    选举联邦院的第１７９区安热罗·苏特鲁斯克区
    请您将要选的一个候选人姓名留下，去掉其他人的姓名
    候选代表的姓名，父名  被谁推举为候选代表
    莫斯克温·瓦西里·阿尔先捷维奇  当地某某工厂，矿坑，农场、机器拖拉机站的工农的集体
    朱成柯拿了选举票，独个儿到了隔壁一个空房间里，关起门来，进行秘密的自由的选举：在选举票上留下他所认可的候选人的名字。这时候不允许任何别的人进这个房间，参观者也不能例外。一会儿，朱成柯出来，到了隔壁又一间房子，那里放着像邮箱一样的投票箱，把他的选举票从箱口投进去。这样，他完成了十八岁以上的苏联公民都有权参加的选举手续。全列车四百多人就这样一个个地进行选举。到了七点半钟，一百九十人投了票；到了八点十分，二是二十人投了票。有一个老太太抱恙不能到投票的车箱去，选举委员会就派人把选举票送到她面前，由她选好后拿去。列车上的选举人，无疑地像全苏联的公民一样，都投了共产党员和非党员联盟的候选人的票。在选举前夕，我们询问同车的一位团长将投谁的票。他说：已提出来的候选人是不会错的，我将投他们的票。三月十四日揭晓的全苏选举结果证明：参加投票的一一一、一一六、三七三人中，一一一、○九○、○一○人，亦即百分之九九·九八，投了以斯大林为首的共产党员和非党员联盟的候选人的票。叶列孟柯和莫斯克温都当选了。
    十二日午饭的时候，列车的餐车里坐满了喜气洋洋的苏联公民。他们说，这是大节日。他们开怀畅饮着。我们邻桌有一位水兵，指着他同桌的两位苏联人，热情地告诉我们说：“我是俄罗斯人，他是摩尔达维人，他是鞑靼人，我们像兄弟般在一起，我们没有人剥削人的事情，我们都是一样的，一样地投票选举呵！”怕我们听不懂话，他们各伸一只手，握在一起，说：“看，这样的，友好！”然后，这位水兵又把我们的手加上去，握在一起，说：“和中国人民，一样的，友好！”
    三月十九日，莫斯科
