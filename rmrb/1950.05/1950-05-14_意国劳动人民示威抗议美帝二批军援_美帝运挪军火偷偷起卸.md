Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 12th: TASS reports from Rome: According to <i>Unità</i>, police and the military have once again blockaded the port of Naples since the 10th, because another ship carrying American military supplies for Italy has docked in the port.

　　意国劳动人民示威抗议美帝二批军援
　　美帝运挪军火偷偷起卸
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社罗马讯：团结报报道：自十日开始，警察和军队又再次封锁了那不勒斯港口，因为又有一艘载运供给意大利的美国军火的船只在港内停泊。
    当天，劳动人民举行了示威，抗议把那不勒斯变为军事基地。强大的警察队驱散了示威群众，他们用木棍殴打并逮捕积极的和平支持者，一日之内就逮捕了七十多人。威尼斯近郊的工人区域，如卡斯特拉、马柏迪斯塔比亚和波素奥利等地，也发生了示威运动。该城和平委员会散发了很多标语和传单，抗议美国的军火援助。
    另据塔斯社奥斯陆十一日讯：《晚邮报》刊载挪威国防部的一项消息：美国军火又有一批运抵奥斯陆并已加以起卸。起卸工作是完全秘密进行的。
