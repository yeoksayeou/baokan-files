Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The full text of the declaration by the Chinese People's Relief Representative Conference opposing Acheson's plot to oppose the Chinese people under the guise of disaster relief is as follows:

　　During the Chinese People's Relief Representative Conference, all representatives thoroughly discussed how to assist the people in eliminating current disasters in various regions and develop people's welfare undertakings, based on the principle of production for self-relief and under the leadership of the Central People's Government. We all believe that, judging from the current government's achievements in disaster relief and the people's ability and confidence in self-reliance through labor, our difficulties can be overcome by ourselves.

　　However, we also heard the rumors fabricated by American imperialism. This makes us resent the despicable shamelessness of imperialism. The rumors say: Our disasters are insurmountable. This propaganda, which is inconsistent with the facts, is obviously not concerned about our disasters, but is a cold arrow against the Chinese people and a confession of gloating. Since imperialism has failed to stop the victory of the Chinese people's revolution, it venomously wishes that the Chinese people would all die of famine.

　　However, after this rumor was spread, it seemed to feel too un-"benevolent," so it quickly added: The United States is a "friend" of the Chinese people and is willing to show great mercy and come to provide relief. If we are not too forgetful, we will not forget: Wasn't it the bandit Chiang Kai-shek who created the disaster for China? And wasn't it because he obeyed the orders of his American masters to oppose communism and the Soviet Union that Chiang dared to launch an anti-people's war? What a "friend" of the Chinese people! Coming to "provide relief"? Wait a minute! The Chinese people, today, will not be deceived or insulted!

　　Sure enough, Acheson, the spokesman of American imperialism, blurted out: This is a "great opportunity to win the hearts of the Chinese people and strike at the Soviet Union." Yes, we have long learned that the "assistance" of American imperialism has always been a trick of "the master shows grace, and the servant thanks him for the reward"; after thanking the reward, one must sell one's soul and act as a vanguard to fight against communism and the Soviet Union for American imperialism. Then, why should American imperialism begrudge a few bags of white flour!

　　At the same time, while American imperialism is shouting to come to China to provide relief, it is also helping the Chiang bandits to hold on to Taiwan, blockading Chinese ports, and indiscriminately bombing coastal cities. What a treacherous two-faced man! This is teaching us to die whether we eat or not; even if we eat American white flour, we still can't withstand American bombs! But aren't our people a group of idiots, can't we see through this little trick! We declare in unison and firmly: We do not accept this "gift," and, furthermore, we will liberate Taiwan, eliminate the running dogs of American imperialism, liberate the last base of American imperialism in creating disasters in China, and wash away the insults imposed on the Chinese people by American imperialism!

　　All Representatives of the Chinese People's Relief Representative Conference
　　April 29, 1950

　　人民救济代表会议发表宣言
    反对艾奇逊破坏阴谋   
    不许美帝假借救灾毒害中国人民
    【新华社三日讯】中国人民救济代表会议反对艾奇逊假借救灾实行反中国人民阴谋的宣言，全文如下：
    在中国人民救济代表会议开会时，全体代表详细的讨论了如何本着生产自救的原则，在中央人民政府领导下，去协助人民消灭目前各地的灾荒，并展开人民福利的事业。我们都相信，以今日政府救灾的成绩和人民劳动自救的能力与信心来看，我们的困难是可以由我们自己克服的。
    可是，我们也听到了美国帝国主义给我们造的谣言。这使我们愤恨帝国主义的卑鄙无耻。谣言说：我们的灾荒是无法渡过的。这与事实不合的宣传，显然不是关切我们的灾难，而是反中国人民的冷箭，是幸灾乐祸的口供。帝国主义既没法阻遏中国人民革命的胜利，便口恶心毒的愿中国人民都死于饥馑。
    不过，这谣言说出之后，又似乎觉得太不“仁慈”，于是赶紧又补上：美国是中国人民的“朋友”，愿意大发慈悲，前来放赈。假若我们不太健忘，我们便不会忘记：给中国制造灾难的，不是蒋匪介石么？而蒋匪的敢于发动反人民的战争，不是因为服从美国主子反共反苏的命令么？好一个中国人民的“朋友”！来“放赈”么？且慢！中国的人民，在今天，是不受欺骗，不受污辱的！
    果然，美帝的发言人艾奇逊不打自招的说出：这是“争取中国民心，打击苏联的大好机会”。是的，我们久已领教过了，美帝的“援助”，一向是“老爷开恩，小人谢赏”的把戏；谢了赏的，便须出卖灵魂，去为美帝反共反苏作先锋打头阵。那么，美帝又何惜几口袋白面呢！
    同时，美帝既高喊来华放赈，又帮助蒋匪坚守台湾，封锁中国海口，并滥炸沿海各城市。这是何等阴险的两面人啊！这是教我们吃也死，不吃也死；吃了美帝的白面还是禁不起美帝的炸弹呀！可是我们人民既非一群白痴，还看不穿这点恶作剧吗！我们齐声的，坚决的，声明：我们不接受这种“恩赐”，而且，更进一步的，要解放台湾，消灭美帝的走狗，解放美帝在中国制造灾难的最后根据地，涤清美帝加于中国人民的污辱！
    中国人民救济代表会议全体代表  一九五零年四月二十九日
