To the Editor:

Regarding the incident of Luo Shuming, a teacher at the private Sanzhong Elementary School, beating students, we have conducted a detailed investigation and study, and made the following decisions regarding this matter:

(1) Teacher Luo Shuming violated the principles of people's education by physically assaulting students, and his self-criticism after the incident was insufficient. In order to rectify educational discipline, he is hereby given a demerit. Principal Zhao Tianmin's leadership was inadequate, he failed to report the incident, and he was not sincere in his self-criticism afterward, instead attempting to conclude the matter lightly. He has been given a reprimand.

(2) This incident will be circulated to all elementary schools in the city, and all principals will be instructed to lead a self-criticism and conduct inspections in their schools, and to educate all teachers.

Such a serious phenomenon of corporal punishment occurring in the people's capital is a disgrace to us. We have conducted a deep self-criticism and believe that the occurrence of this incident is mainly due to our inadequate education in leadership, insufficient attention to teachers' learning, and inadequate inspection of school work, which resulted in our failure to implement the spirit of democratic management in every school and to thoroughly eliminate corporal punishment. In the future, we must strengthen the education of teachers and the inspection of school work, and we also hope that all parties will give us criticisms and suggestions at any time.

### 京市文教局　对罗书铭毒打学生的处理

　　对罗书铭毒打学生的处理编辑同志：
    关于私立三忠小学教员罗书铭毒打学生的事情，经我们进行详细的调查研究，对这件事情作如下的处理：
    （一）教员罗书铭违反人民教育指导原则，对学生实行毒打，事情发生后，检讨也不够深刻。为整饬教育工作纪律，着予记过一次。校长赵天民平素领导不够，事情发生既未报告，事后亦不虚心检讨，反企图轻率结束，已予批评处分。
    （二）将本事件通报全市各小学，责成各校长领导展开检讨，并在各校进行检查，对全体教师进行教育。
    这样严重体罚现象发生在人民的首都，是我们的耻辱。我们进行了深刻的检讨，认为这次事情的发生，主要由于我们领导上平素教育不够，对教师学习抓得不紧，对学校工作检查不够，致未能将民主管理的精神贯彻到每一学校，彻底肃清体罚现象。今后一定要加强对教师的教育与学校工作的检查，同时希望各方面随时给我们批评与建议。
                                        北京市人民政府文教局
                                                 五月十三日
