　　Since the Opening of the Spare-time School
　　Seventh District Propaganda Department Xu Zhiwei
　　Since the opening of the Seventh District Spare-time School in Beijing on April 4th, the students' enthusiasm for learning has remained high. Some students even bring their books to work, studying during breaks. For example, several students from the cleaning team squat against the wall during work breaks to do arithmetic. Some students arrive early and recite Chinese in the courtyard. Back in their offices, they organize mutual aid and actively complete their assignments. The teachers also make thorough preparations before class. Full-time teachers research each other's lessons and help each other correct shortcomings before class; sometimes, if they can't finish their work, they have to work overtime to complete it before going home.
　　However, since this is a new endeavor, everyone lacks experience, and some difficulties have been encountered since the beginning of classes, such as inappropriate placement in some classes, teachers' unfamiliarity with spare-time education, and certain difficulties encountered in teaching. In particular, the contradiction between work, production, and study in terms of time has resulted in some students being unable to attend classes on time. The above-mentioned difficulties have been initially resolved through the efforts of the Spare-time Education Work Committee, the school's school affairs committee, and the teaching affairs office. In solving these problems, the following experiences have been gained:
　　1. Adjusting Class Levels
　　During the first two days of classes, some students surrounded the teachers, demanding to change classes (mainly to move up), causing some disruption to the learning order. The reasons were: some students had forgotten courses they had previously studied due to lack of practice, and did not do well on the tests, resulting in being placed in lower classes; after attending class, they quickly remembered everything after seeing the books and hearing the lectures (mainly arithmetic). Others were placed based on varying standards since the tests were not graded by a single teacher. There were also individual students who demanded too much, seeing that there were no new words in the Chinese textbooks and understanding simple articles, and being able to do arithmetic in their heads, and therefore demanded to move up a class. Based on these situations, the teaching affairs office decided to adjust class levels. Students who had to change classes were re-tested by their teachers or the teaching affairs office, and then a decision was made to move them up or down a class. Up to now, the work of adjusting classes has been largely completed, and the school order is gradually becoming regularized.
　　2. Researching and Improving Teaching Methods
　　Spare-time schools are different from ordinary schools, and this is a new endeavor. Not long after classes started, every teacher felt that if they wanted to run the spare-time school well, they had to gradually improve their teaching methods. To achieve this goal, Principal Gu De once introduced the students' situations and teaching methods to the full-time teachers, and the teaching affairs office held a meeting of full-time teachers and a joint meeting of full-time and part-time teachers to study the characteristics and requirements of the students. After research, it was believed that the characteristics of adult students are: (1) strong comprehension ability, poor memory; (2) broad knowledge, rich practical experience; (3) a considerable level of political and ideological understanding. The students' requirements are also different. They feel that they have a lot of practical experience, but they cannot express it well in writing. They generally want to be able to use what they learn to write work reports, summaries, etc. Therefore, in the discussion, the teaching guidelines and methods for the Chinese course were initially determined: culture and politics cannot be strictly separated; when lecturing, it is necessary to explain the central content of the article, focusing on analyzing the structure of the article to achieve the goal of improving culture; in terms of method, the teacher should be the center, inspiring students to think more. The specific steps are: (1) students should raise questions and unfamiliar words and sentences during previewing, and then students should be asked to explain themselves, and finally the teacher should summarize and speak; (2) students should be called upon to read and talk about the general meaning paragraph by paragraph, so that they can understand the central content, and then the teacher should explain and analyze the structure of the article. The results of this method are very good. For example, Wang Shuli, a Chinese teacher in the intermediate class, uses this method to teach, and people who have heard her lectures generally say it is good, and even students from other classes often come to listen to her lectures when they don't have class.
　　3. Ensuring Students Do Not Miss Classes
　　Although the students' enthusiasm for learning is high, some people cannot attend classes on time due to the contradiction between work, production, and study. According to the statistics for the second week (April 10th to 16th), the number of absent students accounted for more than one-third, with the People's Bank of China West Chang'an Street Office and the Commercial Bureau having the highest proportion of absenteeism. Absenteeism has become a serious problem. In order to solve this problem, the following decisions were made at the second school affairs committee meeting on April 22nd:
　　1. Strengthen the organization and leadership of students: In terms of the office: organize into groups by class within the office, merging classes with fewer than three people with other classes; those with more than five people can be organized by administrative unit (sections, units, etc.). The Seventh District's district-level students are organized according to this principle, which has played a good role in ensuring student attendance and organizing mutual learning. In terms of factories: large factories should be organized by factory and workshop, and by class; small factories can be jointly organized with nearby factories. The tasks of the group are specifically defined: to reflect and convey opinions; to organize mutual learning; to ensure attendance on time. At the same time, each unit should find a dedicated person to be responsible for directly contacting the school.
　　2. The Party, the Youth League, and the administration provide guarantees: (1) The administration must ensure that non-major and urgent work does not delay students from attending classes. If work, production, and study cannot be taken into account, prioritize work or production. (2) The Party and the Youth League should do their best to ensure that students do not miss classes. (3) Use various methods to solve the problem of absenteeism. For example, some students in the court take their books back and organize mutual learning themselves when they are performing tasks. Some industrial workers implement work allocation (you work, I go to study, I work, you go to study, taking turns to attend classes, and helping each other afterwards), which solves the difficulties of not being able to study due to overtime and day and night shifts. At the same time, in order to facilitate the supervision and inspection of students' attendance by various units, the teaching affairs office prepares a weekly attendance statistics table and sends one copy each to the administrative负责人 and the school affairs committee members for timely inspection.

### 业余学校开办以来

　　业余学校开办以来
    第七区宣传部  许志伟
    京市七区业余学校，自四月四日开课以来，学员的学习情绪始终高涨。有的学员在工作时间也带着书本，一休息就学习。如清洁队里的几个学员，工作中休息时，拿着本子蹲在墙跟演算术。有的学员上学来的早了，就在院子里念国文。回到机关，他们组织互助，积极完成作业。教员们上课前也都作充分的准备。专任教员上课之前，彼此研究，互相帮助改正缺点；有时工作完不了，要加班完成后才回去。
    但是由于这是一个新的工作，大家经验不多，开课后遇到了一些困难，如编班程度上有的不合适，教员对业余教育生疏，以及教学上遇到的某些困难。特别是工作、生产和学习在时间上的矛盾，以致有些学员不能按时到课。上述困难，在业余教育工作委员会领导和该校校务委员会及教务处各方面的努力下，都初步得到了解决。在解决这些问题当中，得到以下几点经验：
    一、调整班次
    开课头两天中，有些学员围住了教员要求换班（主要是升班），学习秩序有些乱。原因是：有的学员过去学过的课程，因长久没有练习，忘记了，在考试时未答好卷子，编低了班；上课后，一看书，一听讲，很快又想了起来（主要是算术）。也有的是由于编班时不是一个教员评卷，编班标准不够统一。也有个别学员要求过高，看国文没生字，简单文章也能了解，算术用心算也能算上来，因此要求升班。教务处根据这些情况，决定调整班次。必须调班的学员，分别到本班教员或教务处再测验一次，然后决定升或降班。经过测验，学员八一五人中升班的有六十余人，降班的有八、九人。到目前为止，调班工作已大体完成，学校秩序逐步走向正规。
    二、研究改进教学方法
    业余学校和一般学校不同，这是一个新的工作。上课不久，每个教员都感到如果想办好业余学校，在教学方法上必须逐步加以改进。为达到这个目的，校长顾德同志曾向专任教员介绍过一次学员情况和教学方法，教务处并召开过一次专任教员会议，及专兼任教员联席会一次，研究了学员的特点和要求。经研究，认为成人学员的特点是：（１）理解力强，记忆力差。（２）知识广泛，实际经验丰富。（３）有相当的政治水平、思想水平。学员的要求也不同，他们感到自己有许多实际经验，就是不能很好地用文字表达出来，一般的都要求学了能用，能写工作报告、总结等。因此在讨论中初步确定了国文课程的教学方针与方法：文化、政治不能严格分开；在讲课时要说明文章的中心内容，着重分析文章结构，达到提高文化的目的；方法上，以教员为中心，启发学员多思考。具体步骤是：（１）学员预习时把问题和不懂的词句提出来，然后先叫学员自己作解释，最后由教员总结发言。（２）逐段叫学员念和讲大意，使其了解中心内容，然后再由教员讲解和分析文章的结构。这个方法试验的结果很好，如中级班国文教员王淑丽用这个方法教课，一般听过她讲课的人都说好，甚至其他班的学员在没课时也常来听她讲课。
    三、保证学员不缺课
    学员学习情绪虽高，但由于工作、生产与学习有矛盾，有些人便不能按时到课。据第二周的统计（四月十日至十六日），缺课人数占三分之一以上，其中以人民银行西长安街办事处及商业局缺课人数比例最大。缺课已成为目前的严重问题。为了解决这个问题，四月二十二日第二次校务委员会议上作了如下的决定：
    一、加强学员的组织和领导：机关方面：以机关为单位按班编组，不满三人的班和其他班合并编组；超过五人者可按行政单位（科、股等编组）。七区区级学员就是按照这个原则组织起来的，对保证学员上课和组织学习互助方面都起了很好的作用。工厂方面：大的工厂以厂、车间为单位，按班编组；小的工厂可与附近工厂联合编组。并具体规定了小组的任务：反映和传达意见；组织学习互助；保证按时到课。同时各单位并找出一个专人负责，直接与校方联系。
    二、党、团、行政作保证：（一）行政要保证非重大紧急工作不耽误学员上课。如工作、生产与学习不能兼顾时，服从工作或生产。（二）党、团应尽力保证学员不缺课。（三）用各种不同的方法解决缺课问题，如法院有的学员执行任务时，他们把书领回去，自己组织互助学习。产业工人有的实行拨工（你工作，我去学习，我工作你去学习，轮流上课，回来互助），解决了加班和昼夜班不能学习的困难。同时为便于各单位督促检查学员上课情形，教务处每周作出出席统计表送行政负责人及校务委员各一份，以便随时检查。
