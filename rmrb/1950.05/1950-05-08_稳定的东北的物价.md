　　Stable Prices in Northeast China
    Special Correspondent of This Newspaper Tian Liu
    Stable prices have brought a secure life to the people of Northeast China.

    In 1949, the price level in Northeast China only rose by 80 percent, and even that increase was very steady, almost imperceptible. This year, prices have become even more stable and normal. Taking Shenyang as an example: In the first quarter, the retail price of grain in the market was 96.6 percent of that at the end of last December; the price of cloth was also slightly lower, in line with the price of grain. Cloth prices are now equal to those in Tianjin, Beijing, and other cities. The price of 16-count yarn fell by 6.2 percent compared to the end of last year, and 20-count yarn fell by 3.1 percent. The average index was 98 percent of that at the end of last year. The price of coal per catty remained unchanged. Charcoal, kerosene, calcium carbide, firewood, and other items have all decreased in price. The retail index for fuel products was 95.20 compared to December last year. Only the prices of hardware, chemical raw materials, and building materials showed an upward trend. However, firstly, this will not directly affect the lives of the vast majority of the people; secondly, this price increase is also extremely stable and regular, not a blind fluctuation. For example, with hardware equipment, taking December last year as the base, the index was 107.6 percent in January, 110.6 percent in February, and 118 percent in March. For building materials, the index was 105.3 percent in January, 109.5 percent in February, and 119.3 percent in March. The reason why the prices of hardware and building materials have risen slightly is solely because the scale of industrial construction in Northeast China this year is unprecedented – the total value of industrial production in Northeast China this year will increase by nearly 100 percent compared to last year. In order to achieve this glorious goal, large-scale construction plans are being enthusiastically carried out. Therefore, it is inevitable and in line with the law that the construction materials required for it have increased slightly. This shows that production and construction in Northeast China have entered a new stage – a stage of larger-scale industrial recovery and construction. This is in direct contrast to the paralysis of factories and mines closing down and industrial raw materials and equipment having no way out during the Kuomintang rule.

    State-owned trade and cooperatives, with their ample supply of materials and planned regulation of the market, are one of the important factors in price stability. State-owned specialized companies and cooperatives for grain, cloth, fuel, local products, and general merchandise have established a strong trade network and cooperative network in various cities and vast rural areas. Last year, there were 372 state-owned retail stores and 9,000 cooperatives. Last year, the daily necessities directly sold by state-owned stores and cooperatives to the people accounted for 34 percent of the total social retail sales, and they purchased a large amount of surplus grain and local products from farmers. This year, the number of state-owned retail stores will increase to 1,500, and the goods directly supplied to the people will account for about 50 percent of the total social retail sales. The purchase of surplus grain from farmers will increase by more than 44 percent compared to last year, and the purchase of other local products will also increase significantly. With the state's planned purchase and supply, speculative merchants can no longer create a situation of expensive industrial products and cheap agricultural products in the countryside, harming farmers; nor can they manipulate grain prices in cities, endangering the lives of urban residents and industrial production.

    Unified financial and economic management and unified allocation of materials are also important reasons for promoting price stability. Like other liberated areas, the financial and economic construction of Northeast China was once decentralized, self-sufficient, and self-sufficient. With the victory of the war, the financial and economic affairs of the entire region were gradually unified. By 1948, all public grain, taxes, currency issuance, and foreign trade were uniformly managed and controlled by the Northeast People's Government. After the liberation of Shenyang on November 2, all state-owned industries were respectively subordinate to nine administrative bureaus and two specialized companies, such as machinery, coal mines, and textiles, and were uniformly led by the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government. The supply of raw materials, product sales, and material allocation are also controlled by the Industry Department. State-owned trade also established specialized companies and retail stores in order of grain, department stores, etc. In April last year, a General Accounting Bureau was established. All material allocation, transfer accounts, cash supply, and management of state-owned enterprises were handled by the Accounting Bureau, which greatly tightened currency circulation, saved cash, and further stabilized prices. Starting this year, the bank will assume the role of the state's settlement, credit, and cash management center. All transactions between public enterprises are not allowed to be carried out in cash or to incur commercial credit such as borrowing. All transfers are made by the bank. All cash must be deposited in the bank. When the enterprise itself encounters difficulties in capital turnover, it shall apply to the bank for loans in accordance with regulations. As a result, bank deposits have surged, reaching 1.3 times the total amount of issuance by the end of March. Cash reserves have increased by one and a half times compared to the end of last year. Although the amount of loans reached the same amount as the total amount of issuance in order to adapt to large-scale industrial construction, the bank has not issued a single currency since this year, which has made prices more stable.

    The fundamental reason for the stable prices in Northeast China is naturally that the war has ended victoriously and production has recovered rapidly. Last year, industrial production was completed and exceeded the original plan by 4.2 percent. Although agricultural production suffered from severe natural disasters of drought in the north and flooding in the south, it still completed more than 90 percent of the grain production plan. This year, the total value of industrial production will reach 193 percent of last year, and agricultural production will also increase by 37 percent compared to last year. Three years later, both industrial and agricultural production will be restored and exceed the highest production level of the puppet Manchukuo to a large extent. It can be expected that the financial situation will be more consolidated and prices will be more stable as production increases.

### 稳定的东北的物价

　　稳定的东北的物价
    本报特派记者  田流
    稳定的物价，给东北人民带来了安定的生活。
    一九四九年，东北区的物价仅上升百分之八○，而且还是在极其稳健的，几乎是令人不知不觉中上涨的。到了今年，物价就更加稳定，更加正常了。以沈阳市为例：第一季度，粮食市场零售价格相当于去年十二月末的百分之九六·六；纱布价格和粮食价格相适应，也有些微的降落。布价已和津、京等市相等。十六支纱价比去年末落百分之六·二，二十支纱落百分之三·一。平均指数当去年末的百分之九十八。煤斤价格一直无变化。木炭、煤油、电石、木柴等均下落。燃料品的零售指数为去年十二月的九五·二○。只有五金、化工原料、建筑器材价格趋升。但是，第一、它不会直接影响广大人民的生活；第二、这种价格的升涨也是极其平稳和有规律的，并不是盲目的波动。如五金器材，以去年十二月为基数，一月份是百分之一○七·六，二月份是百分之一一○·六，三月份是百分之一一八。建筑器材一月份是百分之一○五·三，二月份是百分之一○九·五，三月份是百分之一一九·三。五金建筑器材的价格所以微涨，唯一的原因是今年东北区的工业建设规模空前巨大——今年东北的工业生产总值将比去年提高近一倍。为着实现这一光荣的目标，大规模的建设计划正热烈进行。因此它所需要的建设器材有些微的上升，是必然的，合乎规律的。这正说明：东北的生产建设已走入了一个新的阶段——更大规模的工业恢复与兴建的阶段。这和国民党统治时代厂矿倒闭，工业原料器材等毫无出路的瘫痪状况恰恰成了一个反比。
    国营贸易及合作社以充裕的物资供应，有计划地调剂市场，这是物价稳定的重要因素之一。国营粮食、纱布、燃料、土产及百货等专业公司和合作社，在各城市及广大乡村，建立强大的贸易网与合作网，去年国营零售店达三七二处，合作社达九千处。去年国营商店及合作社直接卖给人民的日用品，占社会零售总额的百分之三十四，并购入了农民大批的剩余粮食和土产。今年国营零售商店将增至一千五百处，直接供给人民的物品，将占社会零售总额的百分之五○左右，收购农民的剩余粮食将比去年增加百分之四十四以上，其他土产收购也有大量增加。在国家有计划的收购与供销下，投机商人已不可能在乡村中造成工业品贵，农产品贱，杀贱伤农的现象；也不可能在城市中操纵粮价，危害城市居民的生活和工业生产。
    统一财政经济管理，统一调拨物资，也是促使物价稳定的重要原因之一。东北区的财经建设和其他解放区一样，曾经是分散经营、自足自给的，随着战争的胜利，全区财经逐步统一起来。到一九四八年，所有公粮、税收、货币发行以及对外贸易等，都由东北人民政府统一管理掌握。十一月二日沈阳解放后，全部国营工业分别隶属于机械、煤矿、纺织等九个管理局和两个专业公司，统一由东北人民政府工业部领导。原料供给、产品推销及物资调拨，也由工业部掌握。国营贸易也按粮食、百货等次第建立起专业公司及零售店。去年四月并建立起总会计局，所有国营企业的物资调拨、转账、现金供应及管理，统经会计局办理，这就大大的紧缩了通货，节省了现金，使物价进一步稳定下来。今年开始，更由银行担负起国家的结算、信贷、现金管理中心，公营企业的一切往来都不许以现金进行，或发生借贷等商业信用，一律由银行转账。一切现金都需存入银行。企业本身遇有资金周转不灵时，则向银行照章贷款。实行结果，银行存款骤增，三月末已达发行总额的一·三倍。现金库存比去年底增加了一倍半。虽然为适应大规模的工业建设，放款额达到了发行总额的同等数量，但今年以来，银行尚未发行一张货币，这就使物价更趋稳定。
    东北区物价稳定的基本原因，自然还是由于战争已胜利结束，生产已迅速复恢。去年工业生产完成并超过了原计划百分之四·二，农业生产虽遭北旱南涝的严重天灾，仍完成了产粮计划的百分之九○以上。今年工业生产总值将达去年的百分之一九三，农业生产也比去年提高百分之三十七。三年以后，工农业生产都将恢复并在广泛的程度上超过伪满的最高生产水平，可以预期，随着生产高涨而来的是金融的更加巩固，物价更加稳定。
