     Machine-Made Paper and Mechanized Flour Industries
　　Will Establish Labor-Management Consultation Meetings
    [Kyoto City News Agency Dispatch] The Kyoto City Labor Bureau convened meetings on May 5th, separately gathering representatives from both labor and management in the private machine-made paper industry and the private mechanized flour industry of Beijing. The meetings called on both industries to follow the instructions of the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government to establish labor-management consultation meetings in each industry and factory. Representatives from both labor and management in both industries enthusiastically supported this call from the government and unanimously expressed their willingness to establish these meetings as quickly as possible under the leadership of the Labor Bureau, so as to promptly conduct consultations on specific issues such as improving production, business operations, and employee benefits. The Chief of the Second Section of the Labor Bureau also conveyed and explained at the meetings the principles for establishing labor-management consultation meetings in private enterprises, the steps for organizing consultation meetings, and the content and scope of consultations. The labor and management representatives of the mechanized flour industry decided at the meeting to establish a consultation meeting around the 20th of this month. The first topic of discussion will be the negotiation and signing of the industry's second collective labor contract and the adjustment of benefits. The machine-made paper industry, due to recent sluggish sales and difficulties in capital turnover, labor and management will also, after the establishment of the labor-management consultation meeting, negotiate solutions to issues such as employee wages and other benefits during the shutdown period, in order to jointly overcome the current temporary difficulties.
