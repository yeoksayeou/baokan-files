(Shenyang News) Northeast Daily, May 12th, reported: The Benxi Coal and Iron Company Coal Mine Department's safety inspection work has formed a mass movement. Most of the problems discovered during the inspection have been resolved through mass discussion. The department began a major safety inspection on April 1st. Before the inspection, extensive mobilization was carried out, and Party, government, trade union, Youth League, management committee, and employee representative meetings were held for in-depth communication and discussion, giving employees a clearer understanding of this work. Subsequently, responsible cadres, technicians, workers, and representatives from the Party, government, trade union, and Youth League formed an inspection committee, divided into groups, and conducted inspections separately. After ten days, 996 safety issues related to workers and equipment were identified in all production units, and 66.8 percent of these issues had been resolved through worker group discussions. This prevented many incalculable accidents and injuries that could have occurred.

The characteristic of this safety inspection by the department is "mobilizing the masses and conducting in-depth inspections," combining the masses with safety personnel and relying on workers to launch a mass movement of people finding accidents. During the inspection process, leading cadres first reviewed the accidents and losses caused by their own ideological paralysis, and at the same time, conducted in-depth safety education among the workers to reverse the masses' lack of attention to safety work. Through mass discussions, technical operating procedures and safety regulations were formulated. These regulations were mostly practical, and more than 80 percent of them have been implemented among the masses. Phenomena of violating safety regulations and operating procedures have been largely eliminated. In order to prevent employees from becoming complacent about this issue and to earnestly maintain the results of the inspection, the department established and improved three sets of safety inspection organizations through the masses during the inspection. These are: the mine inspection team, which is specifically responsible for the overall inspection of the entire mine; safety inspectors, who are specifically responsible for inspecting underground ventilation, gas, blasting, and other issues; and group inspectors, who focus on inspecting operating procedures and labor discipline. The three cooperate with each other and exchange information, which not only helps leading cadres to understand and grasp the overall situation in a timely manner, but also becomes a powerful organization for promoting the safety responsibility system.

    保安检查形成群众运动
    大部问题已获合理解决
    【沈阳讯】东北日报五月十二日消息：本溪煤铁公司煤矿部的保安检查工作，已形成群众运动。检查出来的大部问题，已经群众讨论获得解决。该部于四月一日开始进行保安大检查。检查以前，进行了广泛的动员，召开党、政、工会、青年团、管委会、职工代表会等，进行深入的传达、讨论，使职工对于这一工作有了较明确的认识。接着，由各负责干部，技术人员，工人及党、政、工、青代表，组织了检查委员会，划分小组，分头进行检查。经过十天工夫，在所有生产单位中，检查出有关工人和设备的安全不良问题九百九十六件，其中的百分之六十六·八，已经工人小组讨论，获得解决。这样，就防止了可能发生的许多不可估量的事故和伤亡。
    该部此次保安检查的特点是“发动群众，深入检查”，使群众与保安人员相结合，依靠工人，展开人找事故的群众性运动。在检查过程中，领导干部首先检讨了由于自己思想麻痹而形成的事故和损失，同时在工人中深入进行保安教育，扭转群众不重视保安工作的思想。通过群众讨论，制订了技术操作规程与保安条例。这些条例多是切合实际的，其中百分之八十以上已在群众中实行起来。违反安全纪律、违反操作规程的现象已大部消灭。为了防止职工对于这个问题发生自满情绪，认真保持检查的成果，该部在检查中，又通过群众，建立与健全了三套保安检查组织。即：矿检查组，专门负责全矿的全面检查；保安检查员，专门进行坑下通风、瓦斯、放炮等问题的检查；小组检查员，着重检查操作规程和劳动纪律。三者互相配合，交流情况，不仅帮助领导干部及时了解和掌握全面情况，并成为推行保安专责制的有力组织。
