　　According to the Shanxi Daily, after the Shanxi Provincial People's Representative Conference concluded on March 26, representatives from various regions returned to their hometowns and earnestly conveyed the resolutions of the conference. This further strengthened the connection between the government and the people, and provided a strong guarantee for the implementation of the conference's resolutions. As of the 11th of this month, the Shanxi Provincial People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee had received reports from 103 representatives regarding their work in conveying the conference's resolutions. From these reports, it can be seen that the representatives generally conveyed the information through county people's governments, county people's representative conferences, and various mass meetings and individual conversations. The content of the transmission included the basic spirit of the conference, the provincial government's policy guidelines and tasks, various resolutions of the conference, and the representatives' impressions and observations of the conference. A detailed explanation was given regarding this year's production work and the conference's resolution on implementing the State Council's decision to unify national financial and economic work. Many representatives also focused on conveying the parts that were closely related to the local work, based on the specific conditions of each region. For example, Li Shunda, a farmer representative from Changzhi Prefecture, and Li Qisuan, a representative from Pingshun County, returned to Pingshun County and participated in the county's labor hero and technical expert meeting and the second session of the People's Representative Conference. They conveyed the spirit of democratic unity of the Shanxi Provincial People's Representative Conference and Chairman Cheng Zihua's report on the provincial government's policy guidelines and tasks for this year. At the county People's Representative Conference, they also answered the representatives' questions about the county's proposals to the provincial People's Representative Conference, item by item, in accordance with the spirit of the provincial People's Representative Conference. In the transmission, they emphasized the task of increasing production this year. After the transmission, the county People's Representatives also conducted group discussions, made resolutions, and mobilized the people of the county to implement them.

　　Qu Rongsheng, a trade union representative from Xin County Prefecture, convened a meeting of workers from various private factories and some private cotton weaving factory owners in the area that he could gather after returning to his hometown. He briefly introduced the situation of the provincial People's Representative Conference, conveyed the provincial government's policy guidelines and tasks, and discussed them. Then, he elaborated in detail on the issues related to private industry and commerce in the speech of Lai Ruoyu, the representative of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the provincial People's Representative Conference, and explained the benefits and methods of democratizing factory management.

　　Lan Zhusheng, a representative from the transportation sector, convened employees of the Taiyuan Telecommunications Bureau and units such as the engineering team and the motor repair factory to convey the resolutions of the conference after returning. He focused on conveying the part related to the budget of financial revenue and expenditure, explained the reasons for the current difficulties in the victory, as well as the favorable conditions and methods to overcome the difficulties, and explained the importance of active production and strict economy. Combining with the actual situation of the bureau, he cited some specific ways to save production, such as collecting lost equipment, cherishing state property, and utilizing waste materials.

　　Due to the deep and widespread transmission work, many problems were solved ideologically for the masses, the doubts of some masses were eliminated, and everyone's production enthusiasm was improved. The masses who heard the transmission warmly supported the resolutions of the provincial People's Representative Conference, determined to assist the government in implementing them, and have begun to put them into practice. For example, Wang Baoze and Cao Shuzhe, representatives of the Pingshun County People's Representative Conference, immediately took time to publicize to the masses after hearing the transmission of the resolutions of the provincial People's Representative Conference, and first made their own annual production plans. The private cotton weaving factories in Xin County were originally in a labor-capital dispute, and both sides were deadlocked and did not start work. After hearing the transmission of Comrade Lai Ruoyu's report on private industry and commerce, the capitalists' thinking began to change, and the workers also expressed their welcome. The labor-capital dispute was resolved in accordance with the principles of the report. Now, all the factories have started work. Since the employees of the Taiyuan Telecommunications Bureau heard the transmission about production and economy, they have immediately put it into practice. For example, Zhang Shengyun, when inspecting user machine lines outside, recovered 1,260 meters of waste lines and four telephones scattered outside the bureau. The engineering team also recovered 200 meters of waste lines.

　　山西省各界代表会议后代表深入传达决议
　　听到传达的群众生产情绪提高
    【本报讯】据山西日报消息：山西省各界人民代表会议，于三月二十六日闭幕后，各地代表回籍，均认真传达了大会的决议，进一步加强了政府与人民的联系，为大会决议的实施作了有力的保证。截至本月十一日止，该省各界代表会议协商委员会已收到一百零三位代表关于大会决议传达工作的报告。由这些报告中看，各代表传达的方式一般是通过县人民政府、县各界代表会以及利用各种群众集会与个别谈话等进行。传达内容包括大会基本精神、省府施政方针任务、大会各项决议和大会观感、见闻等。对今年生产工作和大会关于贯彻政务院统一国家财政经济工作决定的决议，则作了详尽的说明。许多代表并根据各地具体情况，着重传达了与当地工作有密切关系的部分。如长治专区农民代表李顺达和平顺县代表李起拴，回平顺县之后，先后参加了该县的劳动英雄与技术能手会议和第二届各界人民代表会议，将省各界人民代表会的民主团结精神与程子华主席关于省府今年施政方针与任务的报告均作了传达。在县各界代表会上，并将该县向省各界代表会的提案依照省各界代表会的精神，逐条向代表们作了解答。在传达中，并强调今年增产的任务。传达后，县各界代表又进行了分组讨论，作出了决议，动员全县人民贯彻执行。
    忻县专区工会代表曲荣升回籍之后，召集了该区可能召集到的各私营工厂工人和一部分私营棉织工厂厂主开会。简要地介绍了省各界代表会的情况，传达了省府施政方针与任务，并作了讨论。然后将中共山西省委代表赖若愚在省各界代表会上的发言中有关私营工商业的问题作了详细的阐述，并解释了工厂管理民主化的好处和方法。
    交通界代表蓝竹生，回去后召集太原电信局本局和工程队、电机修造厂等单位员工传达了大会决议。他着重传达了有关财政收支概算的部分，并说明目前胜利中的困难产生的原因以及克服困难的有利条件和办法，说明积极生产和厉行节约的重要。并结合该局实际情况，举出一些节约生产的具体办法，如收集散失的器材、爱护国家财产、利用废料等。
    由于传达工作的深入普遍，从思想上给群众解决了许多问题，消除了部分群众的疑虑，提高了大家的生产情绪。听到传达的群众，莫不热烈拥护省各界代表会的决议，决心协助政府执行，并已开始见诸实现。如平顺县各界代表会代表王保则和曹述哲，听了省各界代表会决议的传达后，回村立刻抽时间向群众宣传，并首先作出了自己的全年生产计划。忻县各私营棉织工厂原来正闹劳资纠纷，双方僵持未开工，自听了赖若愚同志报告中关于私营工商业问题的传达之后，资方思想开始转变，劳方也表示欢迎，即依照报告的原则解决了劳资纠纷。现在，各该工厂全部开工了。太原电信局职工自从听了有关生产节约的传达之后，职工们立即实行。如张盛云在外检查用户机线时，收回了该局散布在外的废线一千二百六十米及电话机四部。工程队也收回了废线二百米。
