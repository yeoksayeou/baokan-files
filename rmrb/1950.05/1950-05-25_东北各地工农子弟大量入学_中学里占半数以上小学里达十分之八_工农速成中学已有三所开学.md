Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 23rd—With the thorough realization of land reform, the recovery and development of industrial and agricultural production, and the gradual improvement of people's lives, the number of workers' and peasants' children in schools in Northeast China has greatly increased. Currently, there are more than 4,752,600 students of all levels in the region, accounting for approximately 11.5% of the population of Northeast China. In middle schools, workers' and peasants' children already account for more than 50% of the total number of students. In elementary schools, the children of workers, peasants, and urban poor account for an average of 81.3% of the total number of enrolled children. For example, in Zhenghong Wutun Complete Primary School in the urban area of Shuangcheng County, Songjiang Province, there were only two classes and fewer than 80 students during the puppet Manchukuo period, mostly children of landlords and rich peasants. Now, there are six classes, and the number of students has increased to 283, including 110 students whose families were poor peasants in the past, 87 students whose families were farm laborers in the past, and 51 students whose families were middle peasants. In total, the children of farm laborers, poor peasants, and middle peasants account for 88% of the total number of students. In addition to regular schools, most provinces and cities have also specially established workers' and peasants' cultural supplementary schools, equivalent to the middle school level, or attached workers' and peasants' classes to various middle schools, to cultivate a large number of outstanding workers' and peasants' cadres. According to statistics, more than 3,000 students entered workers' and peasants' classes in the four provinces of Liaodong, Liaoxi, Songjiang, and Heilongjiang last year.

This year, in order to further cultivate new-type intellectuals of worker and peasant origin in a more planned and step-by-step manner, the Northeast People's Government has decided to first establish four workers' and peasants' rapid course middle schools, and three of them have already opened one after another. Next semester, the Northeast Administrative College will be renamed Northeast People's University to absorb workers' and peasants' youth and cadres. In ordinary middle and elementary schools in various places, school authorities also give more care and convenience to the education of workers' and peasants' children. In order to help workers' and peasants' children who are slightly older and had no opportunity to study in the past, Jiamusi City Elementary School in Songjiang Province has specially established rapid course classes so that students can learn according to their own abilities, resulting in good results. Many workers' and peasants' children have completed a year and a half of courses in one year, shortening the duration of their studies.

Due to the large number of workers' and peasants' children entering schools, the total number of middle school students in Northeast China has increased by 135% compared to the puppet Manchukuo period, and the total number of elementary school students has increased by 81% compared to the highest number during the puppet Manchukuo period. However, the existing number of school buildings and teachers in various places is still far from meeting the people's demand for learning culture. To this end, many cities have actively launched social education work to meet the people's needs for learning culture. The Shenyang Municipal Education Bureau has organized more than 1,200 "little teachers" to undertake teaching work in their spare time, enabling more than 15,000 poor and out-of-school children to have the opportunity to learn to read. In the countryside, farmers automatically set up schools. For example, farmers in Tieling District, Mudanjiang City, Songjiang Province, used the income from sideline production to build a complete primary school building. Farmers in Daguchengzi Village, San District, Xinmin County, Liaoxi Province, saved money and collected funds to open a complete primary school, which has now enrolled 294 students. These private schools have been praised and rewarded by the government.

　　东北各地工农子弟大量入学
    中学里占半数以上小学里达十分之八
    工农速成中学已有三所开学
    【新华社沈阳二十三日电】随着土地改革彻底实现，工农业生产的恢复发展和人民生活的逐步改善，东北各地学校中工农子弟的数量大大增加。现全区共有大中小学生四百七十五万二千六百余人，约占东北人口百分之十一点五。在中学中，工农子弟已占学生总数百分之五十以上。小学中工农及城市贫民的子弟平均已占入学儿童总数百分之八十一点三。如松江省双城县环城区正红五屯完全小学，在伪满时仅有两个班，学生不到八十人，多系地主富农子弟，如今已有六个班，学生增加到二百八十三人，内有一百一十人的家庭过去是贫农，有八十七人的家庭过去是雇农，有五十一人的家庭是中农，总计雇、贫、中农子弟占学生总数百分之八十八。除了正规学校以外，大部省市还专门设立了相当于中学程度的工农文化补习学校，或在各中学内附设工农班，以培养大批优秀的工农干部。据统计：去年在辽东、辽西、松江、黑龙江四省进入工农班的学生即达三千余人。
    今年，东北人民政府为更进一步有计划、有步骤地培养工农出身的新型知识分子，决定先创办四所工农速成中学，现已有三所先后开学。下学期东北行政学院将改为东北人民大学，吸收工农青年和工农干部入学。在各地的普通中、小学中，学校当局对工农子弟的教育，亦给予更多的照顾和便利。松江省佳木斯市小学为帮助年龄稍大、过去无机会读书的工农子弟学习，特创办了速成班，使学生们根据自己接受能力进行学习，因而效果良好。许多工农子弟在一年中即学完了一年半的课程，缩短了修业时间。
    由于大量工农子弟的入学，东北目前中学生的总数较伪满时期增加了百分之一百三十五，小学生总数较伪满时最高数量增加了百分之八十一。但各地现有校舍和教员的数量，还远不能满足人民对学习文化的要求。许多城市为此积极展开了社会教育工作，以满足人民学习文化的需要。沈阳市教育局组织了一千二百余名“小先生”，利用课余时间担任教学工作，使一万五千余贫苦的失学儿童获得了识字读书的机会。在乡村中，农民自动兴办学校。如松江省牡丹江市郊铁岭区农民以副业生产所得，修建了一所完全小学的校舍。辽西省新民县三区大古城子村农民节衣缩食集资开办完全小学一所，现已招收了二百九十四名学生。这些民办学校都受到了政府的表扬和奖励。
