　　Two Cases of Cadre Work Style Problems
　　Please Pay Attention to Tong County Government
　　Investigate the Work Style of Qianjie Village Cadres

　　Editor Comrades:
　　We are residents of Qianjie Village, Niubaotun, Fifth District, Tong County. We are very dissatisfied with the various behaviors of the village cadres and have petitioned the county and district governments several times for investigation, but to no avail. We are now writing down many facts below, hoping they can be published in the People's Forum.
　　(1) During the autumn grain requisition in 1949, the village cadres decided the grading of land, disaster conditions, and yields, dividing them into four grades: A, B, C, and D, without convening a meeting for democratic assessment.
　　(2) During the autumn requisition, the peasants paid millet for household rations, but it was not accepted. However, the security officer, Lü Yong'an, used millet and sorghum for household rations to steal and replace over 1,000 catties of public grain, lying fallow corn.
　　(3) During the land reform, the land, houses, farm tools, livestock, and carts of the landlords were arbitrarily selected by the village cadres, and no one was allowed to interfere, resulting in a very unfair distribution.
　　(4) Shen Hongling, the chairman of the Peasants' Representative Conference, sold two pigs belonging to the landlord Wang Fengzhang on his own and sold the landlord's fermented bean dregs to the peasants, exchanging one dou of corn for every hundred catties.
　　(5) The Peasants' Representative Conference retained more than 30 mu of land, which was divided and cultivated by the cadres, and the masses do not know the reason for this.
　　(6) Village cadres Zhang Furong, Lü Yong'an, and Wang Yuheng, fully armed, broke into Wang Fengtian's house at night and fled over the wall after Wang Fengtian shouted loudly.
　　(7) Wang Fengqi participated in the reactionary faction in Langzi County and fought against the Eighth Route Army. Now, he has been invited by the Farmers' Association to be an "assistant" and is acting lawlessly in the village. Lü Yong'an also participated in the puppet security forces during the Japanese occupation.

　　Editor's Note: If the situation reflected in this letter is true, then the work style of the village cadres in Qianjie Village, Tong County, deserves attention and investigation. We hope that the Tong County Government and the district government where the village is located will investigate the truth of the matter and inform us of the results.

　　两起干部作风问题
　　请通县县政府注意
　　检查前街村干部作风编辑同志：
    我们是通县第五区牛堡屯前街村人，对本村村干部种种行为非常不满，好几次呈请县区政府查究，都没有结果。现把许多事实写在下面，希望能在人民园地发表。
    （一）一九四九年秋征时，本村评议土地、灾情和产量，共分甲乙丙丁四个等级，都由村干部随便决定，并未召集大家开会，民主评定。（二）秋征时农民缴口小米，不收，治安员吕永安却用口小米口高粱盗换公粮伏地玉米一千余斤。（三）土地改革时，地主的土地、房屋、农具、牲口和车，都由村干部任意挑选，不许大家过问，结果分配得很不公平。（四）农代会主席沈鸿铃独自卖去地主王凤章的猪两口，又把地主的酱渣子卖给农民，每百斤换一斗玉米。（五）农代会留地三十余亩，由干部分种，大众不知道这是什么道理。（六）村干部张福荣、吕永安、王玉恒三人全副武装，在夜间闯入王风田家，经王风田大喊后，才越墙而去。（七）王风祺在浪子县参加过反动派，打过八路军，现在却被农会请去做“帮办”，在本村横行无忌。吕永安也参加过日寇统治时期的治安军。
        通县第五区牛堡屯前街村村民王凤田、王朝富、王殿洪、王宋氏、张宝禧同上
                            五月九日
    编者按：这一封信所反映的情况，如果是确实的，那末，通县前街村村干部的作风是值得注意加以检查的。我们希望通县县政府和该村所在的区政府查明此事真相并将结果告诉我们。
