　　Our Army Victoriously Advances Across the Sea with a Powerful Formation

　　Lands on Zhoushan Island and Liberates Dinghai

    The Chiang Kai-shek Bandits are Further Isolated, and the "Blockade" of Shanghai is Completely Broken.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhoushan Front, 17th] The Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army landed on Zhoushan Island on the 17th and liberated Dinghai County. Under the shock of the complete liberation of Hainan Island by the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, and facing the threat of a powerful offensive about to be launched by the Third Field Army, the Kuomintang bandit troops entrenched on the Zhoushan Islands hastily abandoned a large amount of supplies and fled to Taiwan in a panic. The Zhoushan front troops of the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army began to advance victoriously towards Zhoushan Island in powerful formations in batches from 13:00 on the 16th. By the 17th, they had all landed on Zhoushan Island and liberated Shenjiamen, Linggang Town, and Dinghai County. Islands around the main island such as Cezi Mountain, Da Mao Mountain, Dengbu, and Da Mayi were also liberated at the same time. Currently, all units of the People's Liberation Army are continuing to cross the sea and advance towards islands such as Daishan, Putuoshan, and Changtu. The people of the Zhoushan Islands, who have long yearned for liberation under the cruel rule of the Kuomintang bandit troops, warmly welcome the People's Liberation Army.

    【新华社舟山前线十七日电】人民解放军第三野战军已于十七日登陆舟山本岛，并解放定海县城。困守舟山群岛的国民党匪军在人民解放军第四野战军全部解放海南岛胜利声威的震慑下，和面对着第三野战军即将发动的强大攻势的威胁，仓惶遗弃大批物资，向台湾狼狈逃窜。人民解放军第三野战军舟山前线部队于十六日下午一时开始，分批以强大编队渡海向舟山本岛胜利进军，十七日已全部登陆舟山本岛，并解放沈家门、岭港镇及定海县城。本岛周围的册子山、大猫山、登步、大蚂蚁等岛亦于同时解放。现解放军各部正继续渡海向岱山、普陀山、长涂等岛前进中。在国民党匪军长期残酷统治下渴望解放的舟山群岛人民，热烈欢迎人民解放军。
