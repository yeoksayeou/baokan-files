　　The Surging Northeast Production and Construction
　　Special Correspondent of this Newspaper Tian Liu
　　In early April, a major event that caused a sensation in the industrial circles of Northeast China occurred in Shenyang: the Shenyang Smelting Plant completed its April production tasks for crude copper and electrolytic copper from ore in ten days, and on April 10, it exceeded the plant's production plan for the first half of 1950 for this product. This event, occurring on the eve of the first "May Day" Labor Day after the national victory, has even greater significance. It is a shining example, a powerful call to action. Hundreds of thousands of liberated working class people in the Northeast will, like their glorious brothers in the smelting plant, complete and exceed the 1950 industrial construction plan ahead of schedule.
　　The smelting plant's completion of the entire month's ore-to-copper production plan in ten days, and the completion of the half-year ore-to-copper production plan in three months and ten days, is the result of the joint efforts of workers and technicians to improve and upgrade technology; and the creation of various new records in key departments. For example, comrade Chen Lian Gao painstakingly researched and successfully built a magnesia brick true blowing furnace, which doubled production; for example, after the blast furnace and true blowing furnace increased wind pressure, production greatly increased, and the blast furnace melting capacity increased by more than 74%. The true blowing furnace and blast furnace are the heart of the plant, and their increased efficiency also improved other aspects, eventually creating the miracle of completing the entire month's plan in ten days and the half-year plan in three months and ten days. In addition, the plant has made many new creations and improvements in smelting technology during this period. For example, the successful electrolysis of zinc, the discovery of qualitative and quantitative analysis methods for the two rare elements "selenium" and "tellurium," and the determination of the content of selenium and tellurium in anode mud and flue dust have all made extremely beneficial contributions to China's non-ferrous metal industry. Because of the rapid increase in production due to technological improvements and the strict implementation of frugality, the actual cost of the plant's products was reduced by 50% compared with December last year, and also reduced by 2% compared with this year's planned cost. Do not underestimate this 2% cost saving. Zhu Lizhi, Director of the Northeast People's Economic Planning Committee, pointed out in his report on this year's economic plan: if state-owned enterprises in the Northeast can reduce costs by 1%, it will add a huge wealth of 250,000 tons of grain to the country.
　　In this way, the working class of Northeast China is diligently building its own industry with its heroic labor and high wisdom. Last September, the prairie fire of creating new production records ignited by advanced producers powerfully changed the face of Northeast industry, breaking through and surpassing the highest technical quotas of the puppet Manchukuo in a wide range of jobs: the steel industry, the backbone of industry, exceeded the production capacity of the puppet Manchukuo by 69% under the same equipment conditions. Spinning exceeded the puppet Manchukuo by 116.7%. Due to the development of the new record movement, within half a year—from June to December last year, the productivity of state-owned industry in Northeast China increased by 32.83%, enabling the entire region's state-owned industry to complete and exceed the original plan by 4.2%, of which the steel industry, the fuel and power industry, and the machinery manufacturing industry all greatly exceeded the original plan. Moreover, heavy industry and products for reproduction accounted for 74% of the total industrial proportion, which laid a good foundation and a solid cornerstone for the great cause of building the Northeast into a national industrial base.
　　In 1950, the total output value of state-owned industry in Northeast China will increase by 93% compared with last year. Among them, the steel industry will increase by more than three and a half times compared with last year, coal will increase by 55%, electricity will increase by 43%, and the machinery manufacturing industry will increase by more than five and a half times—this has changed and is rapidly changing the colonial, dependent, and unsustainable industrial system created by long-term occupation by Japanese imperialism, which lacks its own machinery manufacturing industry. The machinery manufacturing industry in Northeast China has begun to undertake the glorious task of supplying the needs of the rapidly recovering and developing industrial, mining, and transportation industries. When this year's industrial plan is realized, new changes will take place in the national economy of the Northeast region, and the proportion of industry in the national economy will rise from 35% last year to 43%. Heavy industry and means of production industries account for 79% of the total industrial output value—this is not produced under the conditions of reducing the people's consumer industry. On the contrary, the production quantity of consumer goods has also greatly increased. This year, the total quantity of consumer industrial products will increase by 40% compared with last year.
　　Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, is full of confidence in realizing this huge economic construction plan. He said: The people of Northeast China are extraordinarily brave and hardworking and are capable of doing things. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central People's Government, they can not only defeat the enemy, but also do a good job in economic construction. The facts of the past few months have proved that Chairman Gao Gang's prediction is completely correct. The working class in Northeast China, which has overcome difficulties in every possible way, will not only complete, but also exceed the 1950 economic construction plan. The coal production plan for the first quarter was 2.14 million tons, and the actual production was 2.4 million tons, exceeding it by more than 12%. The Fushun Coal Mine exceeded it by 80%. The enterprises of the Dalian Far East Electric Power Company system exceeded the plan by more than 15%. The turnaround rate of vehicles on the Northeast Railway was reduced from the planned 3.7 days to 3.5 days, and the number of loaded vehicles per day exceeded 15%. In April, the plan to save 100,000 tons of coal for the whole year (from October last year to October this year) was completed. In the first quarter, the state-owned factories and mines in the entire Northeast region completed 109.2% of the original plan, exceeding the original plan by almost one-tenth. In the first ten days of the second quarter—April 10, the Shenyang Smelting Plant completed the entire half-year plan for copper production from ore this year. The Dalian Far East Electric Power Glass Factory also completed the half-year production task on April 26. These advanced mines and factories are a huge driving force and call to action, followed by more factories and mines, completing their production plans ahead of schedule and exceeding them. Now, 54 mines and factories in Shenyang, Andong, Mudanjiang and other cities, as well as in machinery, cement, textile, paper-making and other industries, have completed their April production plans ahead of schedule. Just as all the employees of the Shenyang Rubber Factory No. 1 swore: not only will they complete the production plan for the second quarter ahead of schedule, but they will also complete the entire year's production plan two months ahead of schedule!
　　Northeast agricultural production, like industrial production, has achieved exciting results. Although it suffered severe droughts in the north and floods in the south last year, with the strong support of the People's Government and the hard work of the vast number of farmers, it still achieved 90% of the planned output. This year, the Northeast People's Government will issue 500,000 tons of grain for agricultural investment and loans to promote new agricultural tools, build water conservancy projects, and improve seeds. The Jilin Provincial People's Government has distributed 2,815 Western plows to farmers on time. More than 15,000 improved harrows for summer fields will also be distributed before May 10. This year, the entire Northeast region will expand the cultivated area by 1.8 million hectares, and grain output will increase by 37% compared with last year.
　　Since the beginning of spring, there has been abundant spring rain, and farmers in various places are sending manure to select seeds and sow spring wheat and large fields. The spring wheat sowing plan was completed at the end of April. The tractors of state-owned farms in North Manchuria have been dispatched one after another, and the movement to strive for a bumper harvest has been enthusiastically launched on the fertile soil of thousands of miles in the Northeast.
　　"When the country is good, our lives will be good," therefore, the 40 million brave and hardworking people of the Northeast are working harder on production and construction this year, and they are working harder day by day. Therefore, the lives of the people of the Northeast are better this year than in previous years, and they are getting better day by day.

　　高涨着的东北生产建设
    本报特派记者  田流
    四月初旬，沈阳市发生了一件哄动东北工业界的大事件——沈阳冶炼厂十天完成了四月份的矿石产粗铜、电铜的生产任务，并在四月十日超过了该厂一九五○年前半年该项产品的生产计划。这事件发生在全国胜利后的第一个“五一”劳动节前夕更具有重大意义。它是一个光辉的榜样，一个有力的号召。全东北数十万解放了的工人阶级，必将像自己光荣的冶炼厂弟兄们一样，提前完成并超过一九五○年的工业建设计划。
    冶炼厂十天完成全月矿石产铜计划，三个月零十天完成半年矿石产铜计划，这是工人和技术人员共同努力，提高和改进技术；在各关键部门，创造了多种新纪录的结果。如陈连高工友苦心研究，建造镁砖真吹炉成功，使产量提高一倍；如鼓风炉、真吹炉、风压提高后，产量大大提高，鼓风炉熔解量提高了百分之七十四以上。真吹炉和鼓风炉是该厂的心脏部门，它的效率提高，其他方面也就随着提高起来，终竟创造了十天完成全月计划，三个月零十天完成半年计划的奇迹。此外，该厂在这一时期，冶炼技术上有了许多新的创造和改进。如电解锌试验成功，找到了“硒”“碲”两种稀少原素的定性定量分析法，确定了阳极泥及烟灰中硒、碲的含量等，都给我国有色金属工业作了极其有益的贡献。因为技术改进产量迅速提高，和厉行节约的结果，使该厂产品的实际成本，比去年十二月降低了百分之五○，比今年的计划成本也降低了百分之二。不要低估了这百分之二的成本节约。东北人民经济计划委员会主任朱理治在报告今年的经济计划时指出：如果东北的国营企业，都能降低百分之一的成本，将给国家增加二十五万吨粮食的巨大财富。
    就是这样，东北工人阶级以其英勇的劳动和高度的智慧，辛勤缔造着人民自己的工业。去年九月，由先进生产者所燃起的创造生产新纪录的燎原大火，有力地改变着东北工业的面貌，在广泛的工种中，突破和超越了伪满的最高技术定额：工业脊骨的钢铁工业，在同样设备条件下，生产能率超过伪满时百分之六九。纺纱则超过伪满时百分之一一六·七，由于新纪录运动的开展，半年之内——去年六月至十二月，东北国营工业生产率提高了百分之三二·八三，使全区国营工业完成并超过了原计划的百分之四·二，其中钢铁工业、燃料动力工业以及机械制造工业都大大超过了原订计划。而且重工业和再生产工业产品，占全部工业比重的百分之七十四，这就给建设东北为全国工业基地的伟大事业，作了良好的开端，投下了坚固的基石。
    一九五○年东北国营工业的生产总值，将比去年提高百分之九十三。其中钢铁工业比去年提高三倍半以上，煤炭提高百分之五十五，电力提高百分之四三，机器制造工业将提高五倍半以上——这就改变了并迅速改变着日本帝国主义长期侵占所造成的殖民地的、没有自己的机器制造工业，依赖性的、不能独自自主的工业体系，东北的机器制造工业开始担负起供应迅速恢复与发展着的工矿交通事业需要的光荣任务。今年的工业计划实现时，东北区国民经济将发生新的变化，工业在国民经济中的比重，将由去年的百分之三十五上升至百分之四十三。重工业及生产手段工业占全部工业生产总值的百分之七十九——这并不是在削减人民的消费工业的条件下产生的，相反，消费品的生产数量也大大增加了，今年全部消费品工业产品数量，将比去年增涨百分之四○。
    东北人民政府高岗主席，对于实现这一巨大的经济建设计划充满着信心，他说：东北人民是异常勇敢勤劳的，是会办事情的。在毛主席和中央人民政府领导下，不仅能打倒敌人，也会搞好经济建设。几个月来的事实证明，高岗主席的预见是完全正确的，在万般困难中战胜困难的东北工人阶级，不但会完成，而且能越过一九五○年的经济建设计划。第一季度煤炭生产计划是二一四万吨，实际生产了二四○万吨，超过百分之十二以上，抚顺煤矿则超过百分之八十。大连远电公司系统各企业超过计划百分之十五以上。东北铁路的车辆周转率，由计划的三·七天降低到三·五天，每日装车数目超过百分之十五，四月份便完成了全年（去年十月至今年十月）节省十万吨煤的计划，第一季度全东北区国营工厂、矿山完成了原计划百分之一○九·二，超过原计划几达十分之一。在第二季度开始的第一个十天——四月十日，沈阳冶炼厂又完成了今年上半年矿石产铜的全部计划，大连远电玻璃工厂四月二十六日也完成上半年的生产任务。这些先进的矿、厂，是一个巨大的动力和号召，跟随而来的是更多的厂矿，提前并超过的完成了自己的生产计划。现在沈阳、安东、牡丹江三市及机械、水泥、纺织、造纸等工业已有五十四个矿、厂提前完成四月份生产计划。正像沈阳橡胶一厂全体职工所宣誓的：不但要提前完成第二季度的生产计划，还要提前两个月完成全年的生产计划！
    东北的农业生产和工业生产一样，获得了令人兴奋的成绩。去年虽遭北旱南涝的严重灾荒，但在人民政府大力扶助，广大农民辛勤劳动下，仍获原计划百分之九十的产量。今年东北人民政府将发放五○万吨粮食的农业投资和贷款，用以推广新农具、兴修水利和改良种籽。吉林省人民政府已将洋犁二八一五台按时发到农民手里。夏田用的改良耲耙一万五千余台，五月十日前也可发放完毕。今年东北全区将扩大耕地面积一八○万垧，粮食产量将比去年增加百分之三十七。
    入春以来，春雨充沛，各地农民正纷纷送粪选种，播种春麦和大田。四月底已完成春麦播种计划。北满国营农场拖拉机纷纷出动，争取丰收运动，已在东北沃野千里的肥土上热烈展开了。
    “国家好了，咱生活也就好了”，因此，四千万勇敢勤劳的东北人民，今年更加努力于生产建设，而且一天比一天努力。因此，东北人民的生活，今年更比往年好起来，而且一天更比一天好。
