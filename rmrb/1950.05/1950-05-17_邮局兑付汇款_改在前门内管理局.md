　　Postal Money Order Cashing Changed to the Administration Bureau Inside Qianmen
　　[This newspaper's dispatch] Postal Service News: In the past, postal money orders sent to Beijing from various places, with only the name of the cashing bureau written as "Beijing," had to be cashed at the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau on Dongjiaomin Lane. However, from today onwards, this has been changed to cashing at the Beijing Postal Administration Bureau inside Qianmen. (Postal Bureau Social Service Section)
