　　Eight Thousand Li of Cloud and Moon
    ——Commemorating the First Anniversary of the People's Liberation Army's Victory in Crossing the Yangtze River
    Feng Mu
    It has been a full year since the People's Liberation Army victoriously crossed the Yangtze River.

    A year is but a brief moment in the grand scheme of history. However, for the people, it was an earth-shattering moment. In this year, the wheels of history have advanced at an astonishing speed, and great historical events that would normally take decades have been compressed into this one year. This is a year of earth-shaking changes that have shaken the world!

    In this year, we have experienced so much, but it can all be summarized in a few words: "From victory to victory!" What I will always be proud of is that I and our team completed this historical march together. As I measure the distance from the Yangtze River to the Pearl River to the Red River on a map with a ruler, I am reminded of an old saying: "Eight thousand li of cloud and moon." We have traversed countless fields, rivers, mountains, and remote areas. We have endured countless days of hunger, fatigue, wind, dew, hardship, and difficulty, and we have completed the final eight thousand li of our motherland.

    On this day last year, amidst the vast white mist and dense artillery fire, we crossed the turbulent Yangtze River with the assault team's small boats, following the soldiers as they planted a red flag on top of the enemy's fortress on the south bank of the Yangtze; and on this day, one year later, we followed the same assault team, traversing the desolate mountains and malarial areas of the border region, planting the bright and dazzling Five-Star Red Flag on the frontier of our motherland on the banks of the Red River. Seeing this red flag fluttering in the brilliant sunshine, and at the same time remembering the other red flag from a year ago, people cannot suppress the fervent beating in their hearts. This is not just personal excitement, it is a historical emotion. Our history has finally written its new page (something that the benevolent people with lofty ideals of the past hundred years have dreamed of and striven for with all their might), and the dark clouds over the heads of the Chinese people have vanished forever!

    We constantly talk about victory, but where does victory ultimately come from? During the march, at work, and in meetings, you can hear the soldiers at any time and in any place talking with gratitude, reverence, and trust about Chairman Mao's wise leadership and the people's great support. But in battle, only when you personally participate in the fighting can you experience the determination and strength that Chairman Mao's orders and instructions bring to our troops. But here I would like to mention another thing: the soldiers' strong will. People have created various metaphors for this, but all metaphors are less moving than the facts themselves. Steel is not stronger than the will of the soldiers. I once heard a soldier say during the march: "People say we have iron legs, and even if they are iron legs, they would have been worn short long ago!" This humorous remark contains a moving truth: "Victory is on our legs!" Chairman Mao once quoted Stalin and then added: We Communists and the People's Liberation Army are made of special materials. We are made of pine and willow. Pine trees can withstand any ice, snow, wind, and frost and are tenacious, and willow trees can adapt to any wilderness and take root everywhere. Anyone who has personally experienced the hard struggle of the past year will cherish our every victory even more, and will know what a miracle our army has created in human history with their infinite perseverance and tenacity.

    When I open my diary and recall the past year, the arduous march of eight thousand li flashes before my eyes like a picture. Like seeing every piece of wood and stone on our victory building, I see many memorable days.

    I remember April 21st of last year. A pitch-black night. In order to pull the boats from a secret port ten li away to the riverbank, the soldiers dug several li of ditches overnight, dragging hundreds of boats inch by inch from the ground to the riverbank. And after dawn, when the soldiers sailed straight to the center of the river in the face of dense artillery fire, everyone's mood was unexpectedly calm. No one thought of danger, no one thought of failure, until the assault team rushed to the south bank and the red flag fluttered in the wind, people began to feel excited, a solemn excitement of feeling that they had completed a historical mission.

    I remember the jubilation of the people in southern China and the selfless and courageous pursuit of our army. The sound of firecrackers along the way almost startled all our horses. Braving heavy rain and mud, the troops advanced day and night, and the commanders and soldiers fell into the mud countless times and got up again. Most people had no shoes, even the deputy division commander walked barefoot. The rainstorm destroyed all the umbrellas, and the pouring rain did not stop the troops from advancing for a moment. In this way, without drying their clothes for several days and nights, our team chased from the Yangtze River to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line, annihilating the fleeing enemy from the river defense.

    I remember the mixed feelings of joy and sadness when we entered the old Soviet area of Jiangxi. We saw every looted village and the people; the young and middle-aged people had almost disappeared under the harm of the bandits; the elderly greeted us with tears. However, all this grief and indignation was quickly swept away by a thunderous piece of news: we heard Chairman Mao's solemn announcement of the founding of the People's Republic of China with a steely voice. The radio was crowded with people, listening intently with excited eyes, and people were immersed in a fervent mood for a long time.

    I remember the arduous march in the Wuling Mountains and on both sides of the Yue River. In the heat of the South, the team crossed the endless mountain ranges. Livestock died in groups, grain became scarce day by day, and the soldiers carried mountain guns, grain, and documents, moving with difficulty on the steep and winding mountain roads. Just after crossing the mountains, the pursuit began, without a moment's rest. Along the highways and main roads, along the mountains and rivers, along all passable roads, the team inserted itself into the fleeing enemy like five fingers. These were unforgettable days, with the singing on the boats and the cheers on the shore mixing together on the river surrounded by mountains. Lights and waves reflected each other.

    I remember the days and nights on the Guangdong-Guangxi battlefield, continuous pursuit, continuous battles, continuous autumn rain, continuous mountains and rivers. People seemed to forget everything except walking and fighting! Forgetting sleepiness, forgetting eating, forgetting the interval between day and night. Clothes were torn by wind, rain, and sweat, shoes became a luxury, and people had to put on straw to spend the night in the cold of the deep mountains. In the endless month-long pursuit, our team crossed the snowy Yunwu Mountain and GouLou Mountain, crossed the waist-deep tide area, and entered the treacherous ShiWan mountains. In the biting cold wind, the soldiers climbed over small paths with cliff edges, lighting torches. Some people could not withstand the hardships and fell off the hundred-zhang-deep cliff, becoming sacrifices; all the livestock were abandoned! The director of the division's political department vomited blood from overwork, but he still struggled to move forward. By the time the soldiers completed the cleanup and returned to the assembly area to receive cotton clothes, the weather had warmed up.

    I remember the long-distance raid from western Guangxi to southern Yunnan. Tang Yao, a war criminal captured by us, said in confusion: "This action violates tactical principles!" Our victory is because we can create new principles with our actions. In ten days, our team advanced one thousand three hundred li. Without horses, without luggage, without heavy weapons, people fought with the enemy on their own two feet, regardless of the dangers of the road, regardless of the invasion of miasma, our army kept moving forward. I remember a general of our army, in the roar of the motors, his hoarse voice from many days of sleeplessness echoed in the vanguard troops every day: "Forward, forward regardless of everything! We must catch the enemy! No matter how many difficulties there are ahead, no matter how tired the troops are, no matter how many people fall behind and are reduced, we must move forward! This is Chairman Mao's order! This is the order of history!" In this way, the troops moved forward without rest; in this way, the last largest remnant of the enemy on the mainland was eliminated! People almost forgot how their legs grew. It was not until the final battle ended that people realized that it was difficult to find a pair of intact feet in our team.

    I remember a lot, but they can also be summarized in a few words: "From hardship to hardship." People ask: "Where does victory come from?" We say: "Victory comes from hardship!" A year ago, we often talked about victory, but at that time victory was still a distant prospect. But now, victory is with us, and we also know how victory is achieved. A year ago, when we set off from southern China, a slogan was circulating in the army: "Form up in southern China, roll call in Yunnan!" Now we have already rolled call in Yunnan, we mourn that we have lost many people in our team who once longed for victory with us. For this victory, they shed blood and even gave their lives. Without their hard struggle and heroic sacrifice, there would be no victory for us today, they paved the way forward for us with their blood and lives. "Where does victory come from?" Victory comes to us from this road. May our heroes be immortal!"

### 八千里路云和月——纪念人民解放军渡江胜利一周年

　　八千里路云和月
    ——纪念人民解放军渡江胜利一周年
    冯牧
    人民解放军胜利渡过长江到现在已经整整一年了。
    一年，对于整个历史来说，不过是一段短暂的时间。但对于人民来说，这却是一个惊天动地的时刻。在这一年里，历史车轮飞速地前进，通常须要经过几十年的伟大历史事变，都压缩在这一年里了。这是翻天复地、震撼世界的一年！
    在这一年里，我们经历了很多很多，但它们可以用很少的几个字来概括，这就是：“从胜利到胜利”！将使我永远引为光荣的是我和我们的队伍一起完成了这一段历史的行进。当我用比例尺在地图上量着从长江到珠江到红河的距离的时候，我想起了一句古话：“八千里路云和月”。越过无数田畴、江河、山峦和僻野。度过无数饥饿疲惫、餐风露宿、艰苦困难的日子，我们走完了祖国大地上最后的八千里路。
    去年今天，在漫天的白雾和稠密的炮火下，我们随着突击队的小船渡过了白浪滔天的长江，跟着战士们把一面红旗插上江南岸敌人的要塞顶上；而在一年后的今天，我们又随着同一支突击队，穿过边陲地带的荒山僻岭和瘴疠之区，把鲜明耀目的五星红旗插上了红河畔上的祖国边疆。看见这一面红旗飘扬在灿烂的阳光下，同时又想起一年前的另一面红旗时，人们是无法抑止住心头的狂烈的跳动的。这不是一种个人的激动，这是一种历史的情感。我们的历史终于写完了它的新页（而这是百年来的仁人志士所梦寐以求和全力以赴的），中国人民头上的阴云是一去不复返地消散了！
    我们时时说起胜利，但胜利究竟从何而来？在进军中，在工作里，在会议上，你可以随时随地听到战士们用感激、崇敬和信任的口气在谈论着毛主席的英明指挥和人民的伟大支援。而在战斗中，只有当你亲自参加作战时，你才能体验到毛主席的命令和指示带给我们的部队以何等的决心和力量。但这里我却想说起另一件事：这就是战士们的坚强意志，关于这，人们曾创造过种种的比喻，但是，一切的比喻都没有事实本身更动人。钢铁并不强过战士的意志。我曾经亲耳听过一个战士在进军中说：“人说咱们是铁腿，就是铁腿，也早磨短了！”这句诙谐的话包含一个动人的真理：“胜利就在我们腿上！”毛主席曾经引用斯大森的话而又加以补充说：我们共产党人和人民解放军是用特种材料制成的。我们是用松木和柳木制成的，松树可以忍受任何冰雪风霜而坚韧不拔，柳树可以适应任何荒野僻壤而到处生根。谁要是亲身体验过这一年来的艰辛苦斗的日子谁就将会更加珍重我们的每一个胜利果实，谁就知道我们的军队以他们无限的坚忍和顽强，在人类史上创造了何等的奇迹。
    当我翻开日记追忆起一年来的时日时，八千里路的艰苦行进就像图画似的掠过我的眼前。就像看见了我们胜利建筑上的一木一石一样，我看见了许许多多可纪念的日子。
    我记起了一年前的四月二十一日。漆黑的夜。为了把船只从十里外的隐秘港口拉到江边，战士们连夜里挖成了几里长的沟渠，把几百条船只从平地上一尺一寸地拖到江边。而在拂晓以后，当战士在繁密炮火下乘风破浪直驶江心时，每个人的心情却是出人意料的镇定。没有人想到危险，没有人想到失败，一直到突击队冲上南岸，红旗迎风飘扬，人们心里才开始感到激动，一种庄严的、感到完成了一件历史任务的激动。
    我记起了江南人民的狂欢和我们军队的忘我的奋勇追击。一路上的鞭炮声几乎震惊了我们所有的马匹。冒着大雨和泥泞，部队不分日夜地前进，指挥员和战士们一起无数次地摔倒在泥泞里又爬起来。大部分人没有鞋子，连副师长也一样赤着脚走路。暴风雨毁坏了全部雨伞，倾盆大雨也没有片刻阻止部队的前进。就这样，几天几夜没有干过衣服，我们的队伍从长江追到了浙赣线，歼灭了从江防溃窜的敌人。
    我记起了当我们进入江西老苏区以后的混合着欢欣与凄凉的感情。我们看见了每一个被洗劫了的农村和人民；青壮年在匪徒们的残害下几乎绝迹了；老年人含泪迎接了我们。但是，这一切悲愤之情很快被一个霹雷般的消息一扫而空了：我们听到了毛主席庄严宣告中华人民共和国成立的钢铁的声音。收音机前挤满了人，用兴奋的目光在静听着，人们长久的浸沉在狂热的情绪中。
    我记起了五岭山脉和粤江两岸的艰苦进军。在南方的炎热里，队伍翻过了连绵无垠的崇山峻岭。牲口一群群的死掉，粮食一天天稀少，战士们背着山炮，扛着粮食和文件，在陡峭曲折的山路上艰难地移动着脚步。刚刚翻越了大山，随着又开展了追击，没有片刻的休息。沿着公路和大路，沿着山岭和江边，沿着一切可以走的道路，队伍像五个手指似地插向逃跑的敌人。这是难忘的日子，在群山环抱中的江水上、船上的歌声和岸上的欢呼混成一片。灯光和波光交相辉映。
    我记起了粤桂战场上的日日夜夜，连续的追击，连续的战斗，连续的秋雨，连续的山峦与河流。人们除了走路和战斗以外，似乎一切都忘记了！忘记了睡眼，忘记了吃饭，忘记了日与日，夜与夜的间隔。衣服被风雨和汗水蚀破了，鞋子变成了奢侈品，人们在深山的寒冷中不得不披起稻草过夜。在无休止的一个月的追进中，我们的队伍越过了积雪的云雾山和勾漏山，渡过了没颈的海潮区，进入了艰险的十万大山。在凛冽的寒风里，战士们打着火把，攀越过一条条悬崖绝壁的小道。有的人受不了艰苦的侵袭，失足跌下了百丈深崖，变成了赍粉；牲口全部被遗弃了！师政治部主任在劳累中吐了血，但他仍然支撑着前进。等到战士们完成了清剿，回到集结地区领到棉衣时，天气已转暖了。
    我记起了从桂西到滇南的远程大奔袭。被我们俘虏的战犯汤尧惶惑地说：“这个行动违犯了战术原则！”我们的胜利就因为我们能够以我们的行动来创造新的原则。在十天中，我们的队伍挺进了一千三百里。没有马匹，没有行李，没有重武器，人们是凭着两条腿和敌人战斗，不顾道路的艰险，不顾瘴疠的侵袭，我们的军队不停地前进。我记起了我们军的指挥员某将军，在马达的叫嚣声中，他的因多日不眠而嗄哑的声音每天都在前卫部队中响彻着：“前进，不顾一切的前进！必须抓住敌人！不管前面有多少困难，不管部队有多么疲劳，不管有多少掉队减员，必须前进！这是毛主席的命令！这是历史的命令！”就这样，部队不休息地前进；就这样，消灭了大陆上最后一股最大的残敌！人们几乎忘记了腿是怎样长的。直到战斗最后结束，人们才发现，要在我们队伍中找出一对完好无损的脚来，也是困难的。
    我记起了很多很多，但它们同样也可以用很少的字来概括，这就是：“从艰苦到艰苦”。人们问：“胜利从何而来？”我们说：“胜利从艰苦而来！”一年前，我们也时常谈起胜利，但那时胜利还是一个远景。而现在，胜利已经和我们在一起了，我们也知道了胜利是如何得来的。一年前，当我们从江南出发时，部队中流传着一句口号：“江南站队，云南点名！”现在我们已经在云南点过了名，我们哀悼在我们队伍中已经失去了很多过去曾和我们一起憧憬胜利的人。为了这个胜利，他们流了血，乃至付出了生命。没有他们的艰苦奋斗与英勇牺牲，就没有今天我们的胜利，他们用鲜血和生命为我们铺平了前进的道路。“胜利从何而来？”胜利就从这条道路上向我们走来。愿我们的英雄们永垂不朽！”
