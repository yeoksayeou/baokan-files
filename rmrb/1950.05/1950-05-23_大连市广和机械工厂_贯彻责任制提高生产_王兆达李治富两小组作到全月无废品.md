    Implement Responsibility System to Improve Production
    Wang Zhaoda and Li Zhifu's Groups Achieve Zero Defect Month
    [Our Newspaper's News] The "Luda People's Daily" reports: Workers at the Dalian Guanghe Machinery Factory are earnestly implementing the production responsibility system. In the past month, various aspects of the factory's work have improved, and production results have significantly increased. In January, February, and March, the factory failed to meet its production plan. However, in April, it exceeded the original plan by 26.9%, and the defect rate decreased by 37% compared to March. Wang Zhaoda and Li Zhifu's two model groups achieved the glorious record of not producing a single defective product throughout the month.
    Since the establishment of the responsibility system in April, workers have carefully and cautiously implemented the responsibility system regulations, and proactively taken responsibility for tasks beyond their assigned duties. For example, in the past, riveters would leave finished products on the damp ground, which increased the hardness of the products and affected the machining process. After establishing the responsibility system, workers voluntarily set up a lime trough to place the finished products in, overcoming the difficulties in the machining process for the machinists. The fitter shop had fourteen groups, and in the past, due to unclear responsibilities, work was disconnected. After workers suggested adjusting the labor organization, it was merged into nine groups, which quickly improved work efficiency. The administrative departments also strengthened their sense of responsibility: the storage section sought various ways to improve storage work. The production section strengthened the leadership of inspectors and strictly checked product quality.
    According to the factory's experience, to thoroughly implement the responsibility system, there must be a guarantee of detailed work procedures. In April, some disconnects occurred in the factory's production process, such as incomplete planning, untimely supply of raw materials; and the workers' strengthened sense of individual responsibility, focusing on individual work, but neglecting overall coordination. These were all due to the lack of detailed work procedures. Currently, the factory is preparing to establish contact contracts and formulate various work systems to overcome these shortcomings.

    贯彻责任制提高生产         
    王兆达李治富两小组作到全月无废品
    【本报讯】旅大人民日报消息：大连市广和机械工厂职工，认真贯彻生产责任制。一个月来，该厂各种工作都有改进，生产成绩显著提高。该厂一、二、三月份都没有完成生产计划，四月份则超过原计划百分之二六点九，废品率较三月份降低百分之三十七。该厂王兆达、李治富两个模范小组，创造了全月不出一件废活的光荣纪录。
    该厂自四月份建立责任制以来，工友小心谨慎地执行责任制条例，并且主动负责地去作责任以外的工作。例如：铆工场工友过去作好成品，就丢在湿地上，成品硬度提高，影响车工加工。建立责任制后，工友们自动按设一个石灰槽，将成品放在里面，为车工克服了工作的困难。钳工场有十四个小组，过去因职责不明，工作互相脱节。经工友建议调整劳动组织，归并成九个小组，迅速提高了工作效率。行政各部门也加强了责任心：保管科想各种方法把保管工作作好。生产科加强对检查员的领导，严格检查产品质量。
    根据该厂的经验，要想贯彻实行责任制必须有细密的工作制度的保证。四月份，该厂在生产过程中，发生了一些脱节现象，如计划不完备；原材料供应不及时；职工责任心加强，专心个人工作，但忽略了整体联系等都是由于没有细密的工作制度而产生的。现该厂正准备建立联系合同和制订各种工作制度，以克服这些缺点。
