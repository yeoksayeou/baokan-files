　　The work of the North China region's CCP committees in training rural Party member cadres this past winter and spring has concluded. The vast majority of trained Party member cadres have enhanced their political awareness and become a core force in promoting the current rural production movement.

　　Most rural Party member cadres in North China have been tempered by the War of Resistance Against Japan, the People's Liberation War, and the Land Reform struggle, and possess a considerable degree of awareness. However, they have long been in a dispersed, small-scale production rural environment and burdened with heavy work, with little opportunity to receive systematic education from the Party. Therefore, their ideological and political levels are not high. Especially new Party members who joined after the Land Reform movement do not fully understand the Party's nature and policies. Most rural Party members have vague understandings of the future of the revolution, which affects their enthusiasm for current production and construction. Based on the above situation, the North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee instructed all regions in October of last year to take advantage of the winter slack season to train a large number of rural Party member cadres, so as to improve them ideologically and politically.

　　This training was carried out universally in the four provinces of Hebei, Pingyuan, Shanxi, and Chahar, except for Suiyuan Province. The earliest start was in mid-November last year. Each county adopted the method of training in batches and rotations, with each period lasting about half a month. By the end of March this year, the training plans of each province had been completed. In total, the average participation rate of rural branches in the four provinces was about 90%; the number of Party members participating in the training was nearly 200,000, accounting for more than 10% of the total number of rural Party members. The vast majority of them were village-level cadres. Hebei and other places further carried out universal training so that ordinary Party members were also educated. In some areas, the trained Party members returned to their villages to disseminate the information.

　　The training content in all regions focused on education in New Democratic rural production and construction, supplemented by education in the history of social development (with emphasis on the future of the revolution) and current affairs education. Combining with the thoughts of the Party members, methods such as explanation, discussion, and answering questions were adopted to specifically clarify the direction of the current national economic construction and the importance of agricultural production, and to educate Party members to lead farmers in rural areas to develop mutual aid and cooperation and improve production technology. All regions paid special attention to encouraging Party members to expose confused ideas and provide clear education during the training process. After such systematic ideological education, the confused ideas and erroneous views existing in the minds of most Party members were clarified. They recognized the direction of the current national construction and various specific policies, especially clarifying the agricultural production policy of "diligent production and getting rich," and generally improved ideologically and politically, and production enthusiasm was greatly enhanced. For example, in Wuxiang and Changzhi in Shanxi Province, and Qi County in Pingyuan Province, after the trained Party members returned to their villages, they actively promoted production policies, dispelled the ideological concerns of the peasant masses, and took the lead in organizing the masses to carry out production. In Meijia Village, Luancheng, Hebei, due to the trained Party members returning to the village to promote the policy of production and wealth, the entire village increased the number of livestock fed by more than 150 heads in winter. The trained Party members have mostly become leaders in rural production and construction.

　　Another gain from this training of Party member cadres is that some regions conducted education on Party building and the Party Constitution before the end of the training, focusing on discussing how to be a good Party member, examining the commandism and paternalistic work style of Party member cadres in their work, guiding Party members to conduct self-criticism and mutual criticism, analyzing the harm of commandism and its roots, and further discussing how to take the correct mass line and establish a democratic work style. The trained Party members have undergone considerable changes in their work style after returning to their villages. Party members trained in Fangshan and Pingshan, Hebei Province, took the initiative to study and formulate work plans with non-Party cadres and the masses, and strengthened the connection between the Party and the masses.

　　There were still some shortcomings in this training. In some areas, due to the leading cadres' insufficient understanding of the significance and purpose of the training, they only limited themselves to discussing current work issues and failed to solve problems ideologically, so the results were not significant. In addition, some regions did not explain the socialist future clearly and accurately when lecturing rural Party members, causing some farmers to mistakenly believe that China was about to implement socialism, and mistakenly believe that the so-called implementation of socialism was to eat from a common pot, which led to passivity and wavering in developing production. Although this phenomenon has been overcome, it is a lesson worth noting.

### 华北集训农村党员工作结束  廿万党员政治认识提高  积极领导农村生产建设

　　华北集训农村党员工作结束
    廿万党员政治认识提高  积极领导农村生产建设
    华北各地中共党委于去冬今春集训农村党员干部的工作已结束。绝大多数受训的党员干部，都提高了政治认识，成为推动当前农村生产运动的核心力量。
    华北大部分农村党员干部，都经过了抗日战争、人民解放战争和土地改革斗争的锻炼，有相当的觉悟程度。但他们长期处于分散的小生产的农村环境和繁重的工作中，很少有机会受到党的有系统的教育，因此，思想水平和政治水平不高。特别是土地改革运动以后参加党的新党员，对于党的性质和政策还不十分清楚。多数农村党员对于革命的前途存在着模糊的认识，因而影响了对目前生产建设的积极性。基于以上情况，中共中央华北局于去年十月指示各地，利用冬季农闲时期，大量集训农村党员干部，使其在思想上和政治上提高一步。
    此次集训除绥远省未举行外，河北、平原、山西、察哈尔四省均普遍进行。最早的开始于去年十一月中旬。各县均采取分批轮番训练的办法，每期半月左右，至今年三月底，各省训练计划均告完成。总计四省参加集训的农村支部，平均约在百分之九十左右；集训党员数目近二十万，占农村党员总数百分之十以上。其中绝大多数是村级干部。河北等地并进一步进行了普训，使一般党员也受到教育。有些地区则由受训的党员回村进行传达。
    各地训练内容均以新民主主义的农村生产建设的教育为主，以社会发展史（着重革命前途）教育和时事教育等为辅，结合党员的思想，采用讲解、讨论、解答问题等方法，具体阐明当前国家经济建设的方向以及农业生产的重要性，教育党员在农村中领导农民发展互助合作、改进生产技术。各地在进行集训工作中特别注意了鼓励党员暴露糊涂观念，给以明确的教育。经过这样有系统的思想教育后，多数党员思想中存在着的糊涂观念和错误观点被澄清了。他们认识了当前的国家建设的方向与各项具体政策，特别是明确了“勤劳生产、发家致富”的农业生产方针，普遍地从思想上、政治上提高了一步，生产情绪也大大提高。如山西省武乡、长治，平原省淇县等地，受训党员回村后，积极宣传生产政策，解除了农民群众的思想顾虑，并带头组织群众进行生产。河北栾城梅家村，由于受训党员回村宣传生产致富政策，冬季全村共增喂牲口一百五十多头。受过训练的党员，已多数成为农村生产建设的领导人。
    此次党员干部训练的另一收获，是有些地区在训练结束之前，进行了党的建设和党章的教育，着重讨论了怎样作个好党员，检查了党员干部在工作中的命令主义和包办代替的作风，引导党员进行自我检讨和互相批评，分析了命令主义的危害及其产生的根源，并进一步讨论了如何走正确的群众路线和建立民主作风。受训党员回村后，在工作作风上已有相当转变。河北省房山、平山受训党员主动与党外干部和群众研究和制订工作计划，密切了党与群众的联系。
    此次训练中，还存在着一些缺点。有些地区，由于领导训练的干部对于集训的意义与目的了解不够，只局限于对当前工作问题的讨论，未从思想上来解决问题，因此收效不大。另有些地区在对于农村党员讲授社会主义前途时讲得不清楚不确切，使一部分农民误以为中国即将实行社会主义，并误以为所谓实行社会主义就是吃大锅饭，以致对于发展生产消极动摇了起来。这个现象虽然已经克服，却是一个值得注意的教训。
