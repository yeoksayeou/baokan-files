Xinhua News Agency, 14th Dispatch: A comprehensive TASS dispatch reports: The Soviet Academy of Sciences will hold elections for new academicians this summer. There are twenty vacancies for academicians, and ninety-five candidates have been nominated. There are thirty vacancies for corresponding academicians, and two hundred and sixty-seven candidates have been nominated.
　　The President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Vavilov, wrote in the Izvestia regarding this election: The Soviet Academy of Sciences has recruited the most outstanding scientists in the country. These scientists are the best selected from the large army of young scientists, inventors, innovators in industry and agriculture, and advanced scientists. The Soviet Academy of Sciences is not an organ isolated from the outside world, but an organ closely connected with the scientific and educational organs, industry, and agriculture of the entire country.
　　The largest number of candidates have been recommended for the Departments of Physics and Mathematics, Chemistry, Geology, and Technical Sciences. Eighty-seven scientists were recommended for the Department of Physics and Mathematics, one hundred and one for the Department of Technical Sciences, and seventy-six for the Department of Chemistry. This is because the Soviet Union has made significant progress in the above departments in recent years.
　　The candidates include scientists from nationalities such as Ukrainian, Georgian, Armenian, Uzbek, and Kazakh. More than 50 percent of the candidates received their university education after the October Revolution, 140 are winners of the Stalin Prize, and 44 are Honored Scientists.
　　Xinhua News Agency, 14th Dispatch: According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow on the 10th: The Soviet delegation participating in the International Congress of Mathematicians in Rome has returned to Moscow. Prominent mathematicians from the Soviet Union, Italy, Britain, France, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and other countries attended the conference. The conference discussed reports on several mathematical problems, studied the state of mathematical research in several countries, and planned methods to promote international scientific relations. Professor Alexandrov of the Soviet Union presented his own and Academician Pontryagin of the Soviet Academy of Sciences' two reports on geometry, and Professor Mardzhe Nishvili of the Soviet Union reported on research in number theory. Prominent foreign mathematicians attending the meeting highly praised the work of Soviet mathematicians and hoped to promote scientific relations with the Soviet Union through the exchange of books and the holding of conferences.

　　苏联的卓越科学家
　　三百余位参加科学院新院士竞选
　　苏数学家研究工作获得国际重视
    【新华社十四日讯】综合塔斯社消息：苏联科学院将于今夏举行新院士的选举。院士缺额二十名，现已提出了九十五名候选人；通讯院士缺额三十名，现已提出了二百六十七名候选人。
    苏联科学院院长瓦维洛夫在消息报就这次选举撰文称：苏联科学院罗致了全国最卓越的科学家，这些科学家是从青年科学家、发明家、工农业革新家和先进的科学家的大军中选拔出来的最优秀分子。苏联科学院不是一个与外界绝缘的机关，而是一个与整个国家的科学和教育机关、工业和农业有着密切联系的机关。
    这次最大多数的候选人，都是为物理——数学部、化学部、地质学部和技术科学部推荐的。为物理——数学部推荐了八十七名科学家，为技术科学部推荐了一百零一名，为化学部推荐了七十六名。这是因为近年来苏联在上述各部门中获得了意义重大的进展。
    候选人中包括乌克兰、乔治亚、亚美尼亚、乌兹贝克和哈萨克等民族的科学家。候选人有百分之五十以上都是在十月革命以后才受大学教育的，有一百四十名是斯大林奖金的获奖人，有四十四名是功勋科学工作者。
    【新华社十四日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：参加罗马国际数学家会议的苏联代表团已返抵莫斯科。此次会议有苏、意、英、法、德意志民主共和国、波、捷、荷兰、瑞士等国杰出的数学家参加。会议讨论了若干数学问题的报告，研究了若干国家中数学研究的状况，并规划了促进国际科学关系的方法。苏联的阿历山大洛夫教授发表了他自己的和苏联科学院院士庞德里亚根的两篇关于几何学的报告，苏联马尔德热尼什维尼教授报告了关于数论方面的研究。与会的外国著名数学家，对苏联数学家的工作评价极高，并希望经由交换书籍、举行会议的方法来促进与苏联科学的关系。
