Serious Neglect of Security Work
	Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory Damages Mother Machine

[Report from our Northeast correspondent] The Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory has failed to pay attention to the protection of machinery, resulting in serious damage to Soviet-made new machinery and alarming losses. The factory is equipped with a large number of Soviet machines, most of which are concentrated in Workshop Two. On the 4th of this month, workers discovered and reported to the workshop that two lathes, numbered ○○——一五七 and ○○——九○, had suffered serious damage. This matter attracted great attention from the leading cadres of Workshop Two. A joint inspection team composed of technicians and workers was immediately formed to conduct a detailed inspection of more than 20 lathes. During the inspection, many problems were found, and eight of them were shut down before the 9th. The fact that such machines were damaged so severely in less than two months of use by the factory is worthy of serious attention.

The main reasons for the machine damage are:

	1. Failure to implement the production responsibility system: Each machine in Workshop Two has a sign indicating the name of the responsible worker, but in reality, the sign is just for show, and the workers have never taken responsibility for their own machines. The handover between shifts is also nominal and lacks inspection and supervision.

	2. The leading cadres of the factory did not pay attention to the Northeast Industrial Department's instructions on security inspections, and failed to discover problems in time. Many machine problems that have now been discovered have been accumulating for a long time and have existed for a while. However, during the major inspection period from April 1st to 7th, the factory only conducted a perfunctory inspection by the security section, failing to mobilize workers to participate universally, leading to the continued deepening of machine damage.

	3. Workers are careless, have low technical skills, and violate operating procedures. When workers wipe the internal parts of the lathe headstock, they fail to check for cotton yarn. After the machine is running, the cotton yarn enters the oil filter, blocking the oil passage on the one hand and twisting the filter element on the other. Some workers arbitrarily use iron hammers to beat precision parts such as chucks and tool holders, causing the spindle to loosen and the chuck to not hold tightly.

	4. Saving materials that should not be saved. When installing the machines and scrubbing oil stains, the workshop only issued a small amount of kerosene, which made the machines not thoroughly cleaned, and the original oil stains could not be completely injected out, mixing in the machine oil, which not only soiled the machine oil, but also hindered the smoothness of the oil passage.

	5. The most important reason is still the leadership issue. The leading cadres of the No. 1 Machine Tool Factory completely ignore the safe operation of the machines. Most of the lathes have few oil changes, and some have continued to use them for more than half a year without changing them once. The oil is not thoroughly cleaned when wiping the oil, and the internal temperature of the machine is too high and cannot dissipate, which not only changes the material of the parts and reduces the efficiency, but also easily burns out various rotating friction parts.

In order to prevent similar accidents from happening, the Northeast Industrial Department issued a circular on the 12th of this month, requiring all factories, mines, and bureaus (companies) to conduct a serious security review, thoroughly carry out security work, and ensure the reliable safety of equipment, machinery, and workers' lives. It requires the No. 1 Machine Tool Factory to conduct a strict review, and requires all management bureaus (companies), factories, and mines to accept this lesson and check their own work.

### 严重忽视保安工作  沈阳机器一厂损坏母机

　　严重忽视保安工作
    沈阳机器一厂损坏母机
    【本报东北讯】沈阳第一机器厂不注意保护机器，使苏联新式机器遭受严重损坏，损失惊人。该厂装备的苏联机器很多，大部集中二场使用。本月四日，工友始发现向场方报告说：○○——一五七，○○——九○两车床遭受严重损坏。此事引起二场领导干部极大注意，立即由技术员、工友共同组成检查小组，详细检查了二十多台车床。在检查过程中，发现很多毛病，其中八台于九日前停车。该厂使用此种机器还不及两个月，就损坏得这么利害，值得严重注意。
    造成机器损害的主要原因是：
    一、生产责任制未能贯彻：二场每台机器都挂有牌子，上面注明负责工友姓名，实际上牌子如同虚设，工友从未对自己的床子负起责任。交接班也有名无实，缺乏检查督促。
    二、该厂领导干部没有重视东北工业部关于保安大检查指示，没有及时发现问题。现在发现的许多机器毛病，有些是日积月累，很早就存在着。但在四月一日到七日的大检查期内，厂中仅由保安科负责草率检查，未能普遍发动工友参加，致机器的损害继续加深。
    三、工人粗心，技术水平低，违反操作方法。工友在擦洗车头内部机件时，未能检查清棉纱，机器运转后，棉纱进入滤油器，一方面堵塞油路，他方面绞歪滤油片。若干工人对精密机件如卡盘、刀架等任意用铁锤敲打，使主轴松动，卡活不紧。
    四、节省不应节省的材料。在按装机器刷洗油垢时，场方只发火油少许，使机器清洗不净，原有油垢未能全部注出，混在机油中，既弄脏机油，又妨碍路油通畅。
    五、最主要的原因还是领导问题，一厂领导干部，完全忽视机器安全运转，大多数床子换油次数少，甚至有继续使用半年以上未换一次者，擦油时也未彻底清洗干净，机器内部温度过高，发散不出，这样不仅机件材质起变化，减低效能，同时易烧坏各转动摩擦部分。
    为了防止类似的事故发生，东北工业部于本月十二日发出通报，要求一切厂、矿及各局（公司），必须认真进行保安复查，把保安工作搞彻底，使设备机器和工人的生命有可靠的保证。要求机械局一厂严格检讨，并要求所有管理局（公司）、厂、矿接受这一经验教训，检查自己的工作。
