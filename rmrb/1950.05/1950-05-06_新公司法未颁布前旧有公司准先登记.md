　　[News from the Beijing Municipal News Agency] When the city conducted industrial and commercial registration in August 1949, various operating companies were unable to simultaneously complete re-registration because the new Company Law had not yet been promulgated. The Municipal Bureau of Commerce has now submitted a request to the Ministry of Trade, which has approved that "before the promulgation of the new Company Law, old companies are permitted to register and renew their licenses first." Therefore, it has been decided to handle this work starting immediately.

　　新公司法未颁布前旧有公司准先登记
    【京市新闻处讯】本市于一九四九年八月间举办工商业登记时，因新公司法尚未颁布，各开业公司未能同时办理从新登记。现市商业局已呈奉贸易部批示“在新公司法颁布前，旧有各公司，准予先行登记换证”，故决定于即日起办理此项工作。
