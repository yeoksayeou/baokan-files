　　North China Region Universally Turns and Airs Stored Grain
　　Various Regions Plan to Dry Stored Grain Before Start of Summer

[Tianjin News] According to the Tianjin Daily: In order to ensure the supply of grain to cities and disaster areas, and in response to the higher-level call to prevent grain spoilage, the North China Region Grain Company established a Grain Storage Inspection Command Headquarters in the middle of this month and dispatched four inspection teams to conduct inspections and guidance throughout the region. Since this work began, the entire region has achieved significant results in the turning and airing of grain. According to incomplete statistics, approximately 80% of the total stored grain in the region has been dried to a moisture content below 14%, and basically, grain spoilage has been avoided. The main reasons for achieving the above results are, first, the further understanding by all subordinate units and staff of the importance of grain storage and turning/airing work. They have formulated plans for turning and airing based on their specific situations, proposing to dry all stored grain before the start of summer. To accomplish this task, all units have strengthened the organization of cadres and workers. Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and other places have successively established Grain Airing Command Headquarters and stipulated meeting and reward/punishment systems to strengthen inspection work: corn is generally inspected once a day; sorghum is inspected at least every two days to check the turning and airing situation. Shijiazhuang and Tianjin First Freight Yard completed the first turning and airing work as early as the end of March and are now carrying out the second turning and airing. The Tianjin yard can turn and air 4.5 million catties per day. In addition, in coordination with this grain turning and airing, various regions have carried out warehouse cleaning work. Shijiazhuang established a Warehouse Cleaning Committee to weigh all the turned and aired grain, distinguish grain types, origins, and qualities, and thoroughly investigate the quantity of stored grain. When the Beijing branch company emptied a grain stack, it found a portion of the grain three feet below the top was heating up. The Junliangcheng warehouse detected spoiled grain when emptying a valley stack, preventing it from spreading. In addition, during the inspection of grain turning and airing at Tianjin's entrusted storage households, serious cases of theft and sale were discovered. As of the 26th, a total of 65 households had stolen and sold 915 bags of corn, which were dealt with according to the severity of the case: 53 households were pursued for grain payments, totaling 708 bags; two cunning households have been handed over to the court for handling. In this grain turning and airing work, local governments and troops have provided strong assistance.

　　华北区普遍翻晒存粮
　　各地拟定立夏前晒干存粮计划
    【天津讯】据天津日报消息：华北区粮食公司为保证城市及灾区粮食的供应，并响应上级不坏粮食的号召，曾于本月中旬成立了粮食保管检查指挥部，并派出四个检查小组，分赴全区进行检查督导；这一工作展开后，全区在翻晒工作上，已获得显著的成绩。据不完全统计，全区将水分晒到百分之十四以下的粮食，已达存粮总数的百分之八十左右；而且基本上已做到了不坏粮食。获得以上成绩的主要原因，首先是由于各所属单位及工作人员，都进一步的认识到粮食保管与翻晒工作的重要性，分别根据本身具体情况，拟定了翻晒的计划，提出在立夏前晒干所有的存粮。为了完成这一任务，各单位都加强了干部与工人的组织，保定、石家庄等地，曾先后成立了晒粮指挥部，并规定会议及奖惩制度，加强检查工作：玉米每日普遍检查一次；红粮至少两天检查一次，以检查翻晒的情况。石家庄与天津第一货场，早于三月底即完成了第一次的翻晒工作现正进行第二次翻晒，津场每天可以翻晒四百五十万斤。此外，配合这次粮食翻晒，各地区都进行了仓库清理工作，石家庄成立了仓库清理委员会，将翻晒后的粮食一律过秤，并分清粮种、产地、品质，彻查存粮数量。北京分公司在倒囤时，发现囤顶以下三尺有部分发热的粮食，军粮城仓库倒谷囤时，检出坏谷，不致使其蔓延。此外，天津市在检查代存户粮食翻晒时，发现严重的盗卖现象，截至二十六日止，共有六十五户，计盗卖了玉米九百十五包，均随时分别轻重予以处理：追问粮款者五十三户，共七百零八包；刁滑者两户，已送交法院处理。在这次粮食翻晒工作中，各地政府、部队都予以有力的协助。
