　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 22nd: The cities of Hangzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang are currently adopting methods such as work-for-relief, self-reliance through production, and introducing workers to alternative employment or returning to their hometowns for production to solve the unemployment problem of some workers. Hangzhou is actively carrying out work to introduce unemployed workers to alternative employment and work-for-relief. As of the 12th, 1,009 people in the city had participated in the spring cocoon purchase work of the China Cocoon Company, 149 people had participated in railway maintenance work, and 1,286 people had participated in the work of the Water Conservancy Bureau, China Tea Company, and Grain Company respectively. In addition, more than 10,000 unemployed workers are about to participate in the road construction work-for-relief project of the Zhejiang Provincial Transportation Company. Furthermore, some silk weaving, ironworking, and shoemaking workers who had organized themselves into production cooperatives have also solved some of their livelihood difficulties. The unemployed workers in the cities of Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway mostly come from rural areas. Currently, 4,000 to 5,000 people have returned to their hometowns to participate in production after being mobilized by the trade union. The rest are mostly organized into various small production cooperatives with the help of the trade union, making mosquito nets, socks, towels, and other items for various government agencies, thereby solving their livelihood problems. For example, the production cooperative group organized by Xu Zuzhen and four others in Wuxi City has gained a surplus of more than 200,000 yuan in the past month, excluding food expenses. Zhenjiang City has also organized more than 1,000 porters and rickshaw pullers to carry grain and build river embankments. In addition to organizing porters for self-reliance through production, the Suzhou City Trade Union has also organized more than 4,000 family members of unemployed workers to engage in sideline production such as wasteland reclamation, vegetable cultivation, firewood cutting, and fishing in the suburbs. In addition, the trade unions in various cities have planned to help with the transfer of jobs and have introduced more than 400 skilled workers to work in the Northeast.
