　　From Suffering Complaints from All Sides to Satisfaction on All Sides:
　　Recording the Transformation of Work Style of Rural Cadres in Hulan County
　　I
　　A new scene has appeared in rural Hulan. During the day, there is only a clerk on duty in the village government. If you look for the village head, he will tell you: "He's in the fields!" This year, all the village cadres in Hulan County, except for a very few who are sick or weak, are actually taking the lead in guiding production. The work style of cadres has begun to change!
　　In Wangshan Village, Bai Kui District of the county, during the spring plowing last year, village cadres got up in the middle of the night to beat gongs to call people to feed the horses, and went door-to-door to call people to hitch up plows at three o'clock in the morning. But it took twenty-five days to plant more than 1300 hectares of land. This year, during the spring plowing, the village head and the branch secretary first led their mutual aid teams to the fields, and others followed suit, completing the planting of all the land in just half a month.
　　In Minzhu Village, Changling District, last year during the spring plowing, cadres held meetings with mutual aid team leaders every day to report on production, sent children's corps everywhere to catch lazy people as soon as it dawned, and also established an inspection team to chase people all over the mountains. As a result, the land was not planted until Grain Full, and the masses were full of anger: "You only shout, but why don't you work?" The cadres were also frustrated, feeling that this was "like an old man carrying his daughter-in-law across the river, taking the effort but not getting the reward!" This year, during the spring plowing, the branch secretary and the village head both joined mutual aid teams. They rushed to plant wheat as soon as the soil was four inches deep, leading the whole village. On April 17th, branch secretary Li Mingfu began planting sorghum. Some people said it was too early, so he dug out some of the germinated sorghum seeds from the ground and took them to the production committee for everyone to see. The next day, more than fifty plows went to the fields to plant sorghum. When village head Gao Rong planted millet, he found that the soil was too loose. After discussing it with the team members, he felt that the spring wind was strong, and such loose soil would dry out the wet soil, so he proposed at the production committee to mobilize women and semi-laborers to step on the grids again. As a result, most of the village's land was stepped on three times, avoiding wind drying. This year, the village finished planting the land by the Start of Summer. Last year, village head Gao Rong only worked for three days during the entire spring plowing period, while this year he only missed three days of work.
　　Last year, village cadres did not lead production well, and they themselves could not work. They were criticized by superiors and dissatisfied by the masses, and their "families" did not give them good faces either. Village cadres all said that this was suffering complaints from all sides! This year, Shao Jinming, the village head of Baijia Village, Kangjin District, said well: "If we do a good job in spring plowing, our 'families' will be happy, and the district cadres will not criticize us. I guarantee satisfaction on all three sides!" The peasants said: This year, the land is planted very vigorously, and the cadres don't urge us randomly anymore. The village people's representatives also said: This year is really good! Last year, we had to report every day, and it was really hard to be a representative.
　　II
　　Village cadres participating in production and changing their work style require solving many related issues from top to bottom in order to transform well. Over the past three months, the problems solved by Hulan County, districts, and villages in this transformation can be summarized in the following points:
　　(1) Major village cadres should get rid of trivial matters and concentrate on leading production. In the past, village heads and branch secretaries were often entangled in trivial matters all day long, and they had to personally manage trivial matters such as fights and pigs arching vegetable gardens. After becoming accustomed to this, the people would go to the village head and the branch secretary even for matters that should have been managed by the mediation committee and the civil affairs committee. The village head and the branch secretary were also embarrassed to ask them to find other committee members again, believing that "division of labor must be combined with cooperation, and we cannot fight alone, and we must take the lead everywhere" (Li Mingfu, branch secretary of Minzhu Village). This year, it was proposed that major cadres should "manage less idle affairs," and village government committee members should be responsible according to their division of labor. The masses should try their best to solve minor matters within the group. If they cannot be solved, they should find the responsible committee member to handle them in the evening. If they really cannot handle them, they should find the village head again.
　　(2) Reduce various unnecessary meetings. Li Mingfu said: "Last year, there was nothing but meetings. We were either finding team leaders to hold meetings or convening reports all day long, and we held large meetings at every turn! District cadres also looked for us to hold meetings first when they went to the countryside, and then they held mass meetings!" At that time, the cadres thought that holding meetings was the only way to lead production and to follow the mass line. After the transformation this year, some villages had cadres meet briefly at the village government every night, while others met once every three or seven days, mainly to spread the experience of various mutual aid teams and solve problems in production. Large meetings that must be held should be held on rainy days as much as possible. Districts should not convene village cadres' meetings unless necessary, and should convey matters through district cadres scattered in various villages (such as Bai Kui District). The county party committee guaranteed at the joint meeting of district secretaries and district heads held in April: District cadre meetings will not be held during the busy farming season. When necessary, small-scale seminars will be held with cadres from nearby areas at appropriate locations, and the time will not exceed one day. This year, the number of district and village meetings has been reduced by two-thirds compared to last year. Bai Kui District only held one village cadre meeting during the spring plowing period, while last year there were fourteen or fifteen meetings. Minzhu Village, Changling District, has only held one mass meeting from the first month to now. Farmer Xu Laotou said: "There are fewer meetings this year, but the strength is greater!" The secretary of the Kangjin District Committee said: "Last year, no village cadre meeting was fully attended, but this year all the several meetings held were fully attended, and no one complained!"
　　(3) Stop issuing forms indiscriminately. Last year, everyone was troubled by the large number of forms to be filled out in the village. The county issued them, the district issued them, and sometimes the base point villages also issued them. After the work team went to the village, they also drew a few "investigation forms" and asked the village cadres to fill them out. Some forms had to be "sent immediately," such as one form a day during summer hoeing. In the past, the financial, food, civil affairs, education and other assistants of the Bai Kui District government were busy filling out forms and could not go to the villages at all. The district specially set up two correspondents to send forms to the county. Sometimes this one had not returned when the other one left. This problem was also solved this year after the report forms were implemented in accordance with the regulations of the Northeast People's Government.
　　Transforming the work style cannot only require village cadres, and cannot think that it is only a matter for village cadres; this transformation must be implemented from the county to the district to the village, from top to bottom. Therefore, the transformation of leadership methods by county and district cadres is a more important link. The Hulan County Party Committee has reviewed past shortcomings, believing that the main reason was that "in the past, we failed to promptly conduct in-depth inspections to discover problems and specifically help the lower levels solve them." After the start of spring plowing this year, the county focused on specifically helping the districts, organized three work groups to take charge of three key villages, gained experience by solving the problems of typical mutual aid teams, and disseminated the experience in a timely manner (printing booklets, issuing circulars), making the district cadres feel satisfied with the county's leadership. The district cadres also cultivated a typical mutual aid team, allowing village cadres to learn how to create typical examples and combine them with overall leadership methods. As a result, the village cadres also felt satisfied with the district's leadership. Li Mingfu said: "This year, the district cadres go down to the mutual aid teams, and the village cadres go to the fields to find them while they are working, which is much better than last year."

### 从三面受气到三面满意  记呼兰县农村干部工作作风的转变

　　从三面受气到三面满意
    记呼兰县农村干部工作作风的转变
    一
    新的景象出现在呼兰农村。白天，村政府里只有一个文书值日，如果找村长，他会告诉你：“下地了！”今年，呼兰全县的村干部除去极少数病弱的以外，都实际带头来领导生产。干部作风开始转变了！
    该县白奎区望山村，去年春耕时，村干部半夜起来敲锣叫喂马，三点多钟就挨家挨户去喊叫套犁，但一千三百多垧地种了二十五天。今年春耕，村长、支部书记先带自己的互助小组下地，别人看见就都随着干，只半个月时间就把地全部种完。
    长岭区的民主村，去年春耕时，干部天天找互助组长开会汇报生产情况，天刚亮就派儿童团到处抓懒汉，还成立了一个检查组满山撵人。结果直到小满地才种完，群众还一肚子气：“光叫，你们怎么不干？”干部也鳖屈，觉得这是“老公公背儿媳妇过河，受累不讨好！”今年春耕，支部书记和村长都参加了互助组，地化到四寸深他们就赶先种麦，带起了全村。四月十七日，支部书记李明福就开始种高粱，有人说太早，他就从地里把已经发芽的高粱种扒出一些拿到生产委员会上给大伙看，第二天，就有五十多付?耙下地种高粱。村长郜荣种谷子时发觉土太松，和组员一研究，觉得春风大，这样松会把湿土抽干，就在生产委员会上提出动员妇女和半劳动力再踩一遍格子，结果全村的地大部都踩过三次，避免了风干。今年该村到立夏就已种完了地。去年整个春耕期间，村长郜荣只干了三天活，今年仅仅耽误了三天工。
    去年，村干部是生产领导不好，自己又不能干活，上级批评，群众不满，“家里”也不给好脸色看。村干部都说这是三面受气！今年，康金区白家村长邵金明说的好：“春耕搞好了，我们‘家’也乐了，区干部也不批评了。管保三头满意！”农民们说：今年这地种的挺得劲，干部不乱催了。村人民代表们也说：今年这么可真好！去年一天一汇报，代表可真不好做。
    二
    村干部参加生产，转变作风，必须从上到下解决许多有关问题，才能够很好地转变。三个月来，呼兰县、区、村在这个转变当中所解决的问题，归纳起来有这样几点：
    （一）村里主要干部摆脱琐碎事务，集中精力领导生产。过去，村长、支书往往整天被一些鸡毛蒜皮的事情缠住，什么打架、猪拱菜园子的琐事都要他们亲自去管。这样习惯之后，明明应该是调解委员、民政委员管的事，老百姓也去找村长，找支书。村长、支书也不好意思叫再去找别的委员，认为“分工还得合作，不能单打一，得处处带头”（民主村支书李明福）今年提出了主要干部“闲事少管”，村政府委员按分工负责。群众有小事尽量在小组里解决，解决不了的再在晚上找应管的委员去办，实在办不了的再找村长。
    （二）减少各种不必要的会议。李明福说：“去年是除了开会没有别的，成天不是找组长开会，就是召集汇报，动不动就开大会！区干部下乡也先找我们开会，完了再开群众大会！”那时干部以为只有开会才是领导生产的办法，才是走群众路线。今年转变以后，有的村是干部每天晚上到村政府碰碰头，有的是隔三天或七天碰一次面，主要的是传播各个互助小组的经验，解决生产中的问题。必须开的大会尽可能利用下雨天。区除非必要时不召集村干部开会，有事都通过分散在各村的区干部来传达（如白奎区）。县委在四月份召开的区书、区长联席会上保证：农忙时不开区干部会议，必要时选适当地点找附近地区干部举行小型座谈，时间不超过一天。今年区村的会议比去年减少了三分之二。白奎区春耕期间只开过一回村干部会，去年则开过十四、五次。长岭区民主村从正月到现在只开过一回群众大会。农民徐老头说：“今年会少力量大！”康金区委书记说：“去年开村干部会没有一次到齐的，今年开的几次会都到齐了，还不发牢骚！”
    （三）停止滥发表格。去年，村上填表之多人人头疼，县上发，区上发，基点村有时也发。工作队员下村以后也画几张“调查表”叫村干部填。有些表还要“马上送到”，如夏锄的时候一天要送一张。白奎区区政府的财粮、民政、教育等助理员过去光忙着填表，总不能下村。区上专设两个通讯员往县里送表，有时这个还没回来那个就去了。今年表报按东北人民政府规定执行后，这个问题也解决了。
    转变作风，不能光要求村干部，不能认为只是村干部的事；必须从县到区到村，自上而下地来贯彻这个转变。因此，县、区干部转变领导方法是更重要的一环。呼兰县委曾检讨了过去的缺点，认为主要在于：“过去没能及时深入检查发现问题，并具体帮助下边解决。”今年春耕开始后，县即着重具体帮助区，组织了三个工作组掌握三个重点村，通过解决典型互助组的问题来取得经验，并把经验及时传播出去（印小册子、发通报），使区干部对县的领导感觉满意。区干部也都培养一个典型互助小组，让村干部学习怎样搞典型又结合全面的领导方法。因而村干部对区的领导也感觉满意了。李明福说：“今年区干部下来就到互助小组，村干部正干活就到地里找，比去年好多了。”
