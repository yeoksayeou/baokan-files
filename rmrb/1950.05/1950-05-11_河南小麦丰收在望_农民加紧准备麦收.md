　　Henan Wheat Harvest is in Sight
　  Farmers Intensify Preparations for Wheat Harvesting
    [Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 10th] Henan Province's wheat has headed and flowered, and a bumper harvest is in sight. Farmers throughout the province are intensifying preparations for the wheat harvest. This year in Henan Province, due to timely and widespread spring rains, wheat is growing well everywhere. In particular, in areas such as Baofeng and Jiaxian counties, which have already completed land reform, wheat seedlings are robust and flourishing due to the common practice of hoeing the wheat and increasing topdressing fertilizer during spring plowing this year. It is estimated that the wheat will mature in another twenty days, and the harvest can increase by 10 to 20 percent compared to last year. Many liberated peasants are doubly delighted with the good harvest after land reform, and their enthusiasm for production is high, and they are going to the fields one after another to remove weeds and carry out ridge clearing work. The people in the disaster areas have also greatly increased their confidence in production and overcoming the famine because the wheat harvest is near.
    In order to add to their wheat harvesting tools and livestock, farmers in various places have held "Wheat Commodity Fairs," where large numbers of livestock and farm implements are on the market, and the turnover generally exceeds that of previous years. Many villages have jointly invited blacksmiths to open furnaces in their villages to add and repair wheat harvesting farm implements on a large scale.
    In order to prevent sabotage by bandits and special agents, the Political Department of the Henan Military Region issued instructions to its subordinate troops on May 1st regarding the protection and assistance to the peasant masses in the summer harvest. Under the leadership of farmers' associations and militia teams, some villages have organized joint defense wheat harvesting teams to patrol and guard day and night to ensure the smooth progress of the wheat harvesting work.

　　河南小麦丰收在望
　  农民加紧准备麦收
    【新华社开封十日电】河南省小麦已吐穗扬花，丰收在望。全省各地农民正加紧进行麦收准备工作。河南省今年由于春雨适时普降，各地小麦生长良好，特别是宝丰、郏县等已经完成土地改革的地区，由于今年春耕时普遍进行了锄麦和增加追肥，麦棵茁壮茂盛。估计再有二十天小麦即可成熟，年成可较去年增加一成至二成。许多翻身农民以土地改革后，又得好收成，真是喜上加喜，因之生产情绪高涨，纷纷下地剔除杂草和进行清垅工作。受灾区人民也因麦收已近，生产渡荒的信心倍增。
    各地农民为了添置麦收工具和牲畜，均纷纷举行“小麦古会”，大批牲口和农具上市，成交额一般都超过往年。许多村庄并合伙邀请铁匠到本村开炉，大量添置和修理麦收农具。
    河南军区政治部为了防止土匪特务分子的捣乱和破坏，已于五月一日向所属各部队发出关于保卫和帮助农民群众夏收的指示。有些村庄在农民协会和民兵队的带头下，纷纷组织联防麦收队，日夜巡逻放哨，以保证麦收工作的顺利进行。
