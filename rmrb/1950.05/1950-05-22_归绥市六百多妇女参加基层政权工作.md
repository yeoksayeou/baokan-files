　　[Gui Sui News] According to the Suiyuan Daily News: Since the abolition of the reactionary Baojia system in Gui Sui City, a large number of women have participated in grassroots government work. According to statistics, 84 women in the city have served as positive and deputy neighborhood chiefs, and 603 women have served as positive and deputy group leaders. These women are generally very active in their work after participating in government work. For example, the women's committee members of the fifth district went into households to publicize the significance of abolishing the Baojia system and investigated illegal acts such as the Bao chief's embezzlement of sheepskins. Di Zhongshi, a female neighborhood chief of the third district, and Xu Shugong, a female neighborhood chief of the sixth district, voluntarily mobilized women to participate in literacy classes. Especially in afforestation work, the more female neighborhood chiefs there were, the more women participated in afforestation. For example, the 28 female neighborhood chiefs in the second district mobilized 1,200 women to participate in afforestation.

　　归绥市六百多妇女参加基层政权工作
    【归绥讯】据绥远日报消息：归绥市自废除反动的保甲制度以来，大批妇女参加了基层政权工作。据统计，全市已有八十四名妇女担任了正副闾长，六百零三名妇女担任正副组长。这些妇女参加政权工作后，一般工作都很积极。如五区的妇女委员深入到户宣传废除保甲制度的意义，并查出保长贪污羊皮等不法行为。三区女闾长邸钟氏、六区女闾长徐树功自动发动妇女参加识字班。特别在植树工作上，凡是妇女闾长多的地方，妇女参加植树的就多，如二区二十八个女闾长，发动了一千二百名妇女参加植树。
