　　Xinhua News Agency, May 21st: The Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League issued a notice on the 18th regarding the issue of "League Friends." The text is as follows:

　　(1) The primary task of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League is to unite and educate the younger generation to participate in the New Democratic national construction under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. All of the League's work should be for this purpose.

　　(2) In the past, the Youth League adopted the organizational form of "League Friends" to unite people who were over the age for joining the League. Although this could have a certain effect in helping "League Friends" to progress, it inevitably dispersed the League's strength and affected the League's own work. Now that the League's organization is developing and its own work is increasing, it is even more impossible to disperse more strength on the work of "League Friends." Therefore, it has been decided that the organization of "League Friends" will not be further developed in the future.

　　(3) The League committees at all levels are still responsible for uniting and educating those "League Friends" who have already been developed. They should continue to maintain contact with them, help them progress, and once they have joined a certain revolutionary organization (the Communist Party or various people's organizations), they will no longer retain the "League Friend" qualification.

　　青年团中央关于“团友”问题的通知
    【新华社二十一日讯】中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会于十八日发出关于“团友”问题的通知。文如下：
    （一）中国新民主主义青年团的主要任务，是团结和教育青年一代，在中国共产党的领导之下，参加新民主主义的国家建设。团的一切工作都应当为着这个目的。
    （二）青年团过去采用“团友”的组织形式去团结超过入团年龄的人们，虽然对于帮助“团友”的进步可以有一定的作用，但同时不能不因而分散了团的力量，影响了团的本身工作；现在团的组织日益发展，团的本身工作日益增加，更不能在“团友”的工作上分散更多力量，因此，今后决定不再继续发展“团友”的组织。
    （三）过去已经发展的“团友”，各级团委仍负有团结教育他们的责任，仍应继续和他们保持联系，帮助他们进步，在他们参加了一定的革命组织（共产党或各种人民团体）以后，即可不再保留“团友”资格。
