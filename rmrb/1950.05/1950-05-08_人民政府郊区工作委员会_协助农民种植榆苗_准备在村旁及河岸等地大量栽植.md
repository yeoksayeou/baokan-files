　　[News from the Beijing Municipal News Agency] The Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government has called on suburban farmers to develop elm tree nurseries and plant trees on vacant land near villages, and is assisting in promoting this work. The committee also explained the benefits of planting elm trees and the methods of cultivating elm seedlings as follows:

　　Elm trees are drought-resistant, alkali-resistant, protect riverbanks, and prevent wind.

　　Vacant land near suburban villages, mounds, small river beaches, embankments, and roadsides are not suitable for growing crops, but are suitable for planting trees, especially elm trees. Elm trees are drought-resistant and alkali-resistant, and can be used to protect riverbanks and prevent wind. They can grow in both fertile and barren land. They can not only regulate the climate, but also have hard and strong wood that can be used for construction, vehicles, furniture, etc., which can increase farmers' income. However, the problem of seedlings arises every year. Farmers have to buy them from seedling merchants, which is very expensive, and public nurseries cannot supply them in large quantities, so it is best to open a small nursery yourself. Farmers may not have experience in this matter and dare not try it boldly, but it is actually very easy. To cultivate elm seedlings, first find some scattered vacant land near the house or along the edges of the fields in a sunny place. The size and shape of the area do not matter, and the elevation does not matter either, as long as it is convenient for watering and drainage. Loosen and rake the soil surface so that it is like a vegetable plot. At the same time, quickly collect elm seeds (elm coins) for sowing.

　　Elm seeds from strong trees germinate vigorously

　　It is best to collect elm seeds from under strong, mature elm trees, sweeping up the elm coins that have fallen on the ground. Although the elm seeds from old and young trees can also germinate, the seedlings that grow from the seeds of mature mother trees are more vigorous. Be sure to collect elm coins within the last ten days, otherwise they will be scattered and difficult to collect. Half a catty to a catty of tree seeds is enough for one fen of land.

　　After the plot and seeds are prepared, use the method of row sowing. First, use your fingers to make small grooves on the surface of the plot, three to four fen apart and one finger deep. Then, scatter the elm coins, cover them lightly with fine soil, just enough to press the seeds down, not too thick. Keep the soil moist regularly, and they will germinate in about a week. After germination, consider the situation and thin the seedlings once or twice to prevent overcrowding. Next, loosen the soil and remove weeds like you would for crops. By this autumn, they can grow to about one chi in height.

### 人民政府郊区工作委员会  协助农民种植榆苗  准备在村旁及河岸等地大量栽植

　　人民政府郊区工作委员会
    协助农民种植榆苗
    准备在村旁及河岸等地大量栽植
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民政府郊委会号召郊区农民开辟榆树苗圃，利用村庄附近空地栽树，并正协助推动此一工作。该会并说明栽种榆树的益处及培育榆苗的方法如下：
    榆树能抗旱抗碱护岸防风
    郊区村庄附近空地、土丘、小的河滩堤岸、村道两旁墓地，不适宜种庄稼，但适于栽树，尤其适于种榆树，榆树能抗旱又能抗碱，可用以护岸防风，肥土瘠地都能生长。不但可以调节气候，并且木材坚硬强韧，可以做建筑、车辆、家具等用，能增加农民收入。但每年树苗都成问题，农民有的向苗商购买，价钱很贵，公营的苗圃又不可能大量供给，所以最好是自己开辟一个小苗圃。这件事或许农民没有经验，不敢大胆尝试，其实是很容易的事。培养榆苗的方法，首先在家屋附近或地边阳光充足的地方找些零碎的空地，面积大小形状不拘，地势高低亦没关系，只要便于浇水排水就可。将土面掘松耙平，就像菜畦的情形一样，一方面就赶紧搜集榆籽（榆钱）下种。
    壮树上的榆籽发芽滋长健壮
    搜集榆籽最好在壮年的榆树底下扫集落在地上的榆钱，老树幼树所结的榆籽，虽然亦能发芽，可是不如壮年母树的种子发芽后苗木生长健壮。搜集榆钱一定要把握住在最近十天以内，否则飞散了便不易搜集，树籽的数量一分地播种有半斤到一斤就够了。
    畦子和种子筹妥后，用条播的方法，先用手指在畦面划成一条条小沟，沟距三至四分，沟深一指，然后把榆钱撒下，微微覆细土，只要把种子压住些就行，不可太厚，经常保持土壤湿润，这样一周后，就可发芽，发芽后要斟酌情形实行一两次间苗，使幼苗生长不拥挤，其次松土除草像种庄稼一样，到今秋后就可以长到一尺来高。
