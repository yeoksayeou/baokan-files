Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, May 7th: The Bulgarian Telegraph Agency reported that the Free Greece Radio broadcasted the resolution on the domestic situation adopted by the Central Political Bureau of the Greek Communist Party on April 26, 1950.

The resolution declared: It has been eight months since the main force of the Greek Democratic Army ceased military operations. This period has two main characteristics: First, American aggressors and royalist fascists resolutely refuse to peacefully resolve the outstanding issues and rectify the domestic situation in Greece. They enslave the people and continue to colonize the country, turning Greece into an imperialist military base. Second, the people continue to fight for bread, freedom, and peace, adopting new forms of activity for this purpose.

The situation after the Greek elections is characterized by even more brazen US interference in our country's internal affairs.

America's stubborn insistence on forming the Plastiras government stemmed primarily from their desire to facilitate an agreement between Greece and Tito. In an interview with a reporter from the London Times, Tito stipulated Plastiras's assumption of power as a condition for reaching an agreement with the royalist fascists. Both Tito and Plastiras stated that they would soon appoint envoys to Athens and Belgrade.

The Plastiras government, which has been completely obedient to the Americans from the moment of its establishment, has pursued royalist fascist policies in all aspects of life. The greatest danger to the Greek people and the entire country lies in the ambiguous and adventurist US-British plans to launch a war in Greece, the Balkans, and the Mediterranean. The Americans and British are completing their war preparations in order to send our people's sons to the slaughterhouse.

The war preparations carried out by the American aggressors and Greek royalist fascists are simultaneously supplemented by political and diplomatic actions. In this regard, the most alarming signal to the people is the formation of the Athens-Belgrade "axis." Under American protection and supervision, the executioner Tito and the Plastiras government have held secret consultations, on the one hand to cause bloodshed between the two peoples, and on the other hand to oppose the territorial integrity of Greece. These consultations also concern our children, whom Tito intends to hand over to the royalist fascists. The Americans are prepared to hand over Thessaloniki and Preveza to Tito in order to consolidate the imperialists' bridgehead in the Balkans.

Tito expects to be rewarded by the royalist fascists for betraying the Greek Democratic Army and Greek democrats. Bebergos himself wrote in the Stratistica newspaper (the General Staff's organ) admitting that Tito had helped the royalist fascists in achieving victory over the Greek Democratic Army.

The Athens-Belgrade "axis," in which Rome will also participate, is primarily targeted at the People's Republic of Albania, which the Greek, Titoist, and Italian servants of American imperialism are attempting to partition.

In addition, US and British imperialists are also carrying out activities to attempt to conclude a Mediterranean Pact, which will be a supplement and expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty. The Athens-Ankara axis will also be included in the Mediterranean Pact system as one of its main components.

For several years, Greek territorial waters off the island of Crete have been used as a base for US and British naval and air forces. The air force and navy under American command will soon conduct large-scale exercises again. It is very obvious that such frantic military and strategic actions being carried out in Greece are a fatal danger to the Greek people.

The Americans are trying to use the Greek people to wage the anti-Soviet war they are preparing. But they have made a major mistake. Hitler made exactly the same mistake before. Just as Hitler could not dispatch a single Greek to fight the Soviet Union between 1941 and 1944, the US and British imperialists will not be able to force a Greek to attack the people's democratic countries and socialist countries. Just as the Greek Communists thwarted the plans that the royalist fascists were preparing to invade the People's Republic of Albania in 1945, the Greek Communist Party maintains its firm and unwavering determination now and in the future. The Greek people will never fight against the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries.

Any attempt by the American aggressors and royalist fascists to drag our country into military adventures will be their grave in Greece.

Now, only a democratic front that unites all the people can lead Greece onto the path of peaceful labor, democracy, independence, and peace, and onto the path of making Greece participate in the world people's front, led by the Soviet Union, fighting for peace and democracy.

Our current task is to also establish a united peace front in Greece, because under American occupation, Greece is more threatened than other countries with being turned into a battlefield and cannon fodder supplier. Greece can only stand on the side of the world peace and democracy camp.

The task facing the Greek Communist Party and its members is to once again stand at the forefront of the fighters for the democratic unity of all the people's forces.

Communists continue their activities. They organize workers, clerks, peasants, craftsmen, the disabled, and lead them in the struggle for peace. They are also active in the army, among the hundreds of thousands of mobilized people's sons, and organize them to fight against American occupation and against the royalist fascists. They organize and lead young people and women to fight against new wars and for a better life.

Nothing can crush the will of our people, who have fought in the past, are fighting now, and will continue to fight until victory is achieved. The heroic struggle of the guerrillas in the mountains is a warning and constant reminder to the Americans and royalist fascists that they cannot commit any atrocities and get away with them, or carry out anti-people actions.

The struggle of our people can only have one outcome, and that is the emergence of a free, democratic, and peace-loving Greece, free from American occupiers and fascism—as an equal member of the democratic family of nations, led and exemplified by the great and invincible Soviet Union.

　　希共关于国内形势的决议
    严斥美帝干涉内政及阴谋备战罪行
    重申建立民主阵线坚决为和平斗争
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社索非亚七日讯：据保加利亚通讯社报道：自由希腊电台广播了希腊共产党中央政治局一九五○年四月二十六日所通过的关于国内形势的决议。
    决议宣称：自从希腊民主军主力停止军事行动以来，迄今已有八个月。这一时期有两个主要的特点：一、美国侵略者及保皇法西斯分子断然拒绝和平解决各项悬而未决的问题，和整顿希腊国内的情势，他们奴役人民并变希腊为帝国主义者的军事基地，而继续使国家殖民地化。二、人民继续进行争取面包、自由与和平的斗争，为此目的采取了新的活动方式。
    希腊选举以后的形势，其特点就是美国甚至更加厚颜无耻地干涉我国的内政。
    美国在组成普拉斯蒂拉斯政府方面的顽固坚持，首先出于他们想促成希腊与铁托间达成协议的愿望。铁托在接见伦敦泰晤士报记者发表谈话时，把普拉斯蒂拉斯的执政规定为与保皇法西斯分子达成协议的条件，铁托和普拉斯蒂拉斯两人都曾说过：他们不久将会任命驻雅典与驻贝尔格莱德的公使。
    从成立的最初一刻起就完全服从美国人的普拉斯蒂拉斯政府，在生活的各方面都奉行着保皇法西斯的政策。希腊人民及整个国家的最大危险，就是在希腊、巴尔干及地中海发动战争的暧昧可疑的、冒险主义的美英计划，美国人和英国人正在完成他们的战争准备，以便把我国人民的儿子，送往屠场去。
    美国侵略者与希腊保皇法西斯分子所进行的战争准备，是同时辅以政治行动及外交行动的。在这方面，最令人民触目惊心的信号，便是雅典——贝尔格莱德“轴心”的组成。在美国的庇护与监督下，刽子手铁托与普拉斯蒂拉斯政府已经举行过秘密会商，一方面是要使两国人民流血，另一方面是要反对希腊的领土完整，这些会商并关涉到我们的儿童，铁托意图把他们交给保皇法西斯分子。美国人已准备把萨罗尼加与普累佛萨交给铁托，借以巩固帝国主义者在巴尔干的桥头堡垒。
    铁托期望以出卖希腊民主军与希腊民主人士而获得保皇法西斯分子的报酬。贝贝格斯本人在斯特拉蒂斯蒂卡报（参谋总部机关报）上撰文，也承认铁托已在获取对希腊民主军的胜利上帮助了保皇法西斯。
    罗马也将参加的雅典——贝尔格莱德“轴心”，其目标首先便针对着阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国，美国帝国主义的希腊、铁托与意大利的仆从，正试图把它瓜分。
    此外，美英帝国主义者还进行活动，企图缔结地中海公约，这一公约将是北大西洋公约的补充与扩大。雅典——安哥拉轴心也将列入地中海公约的系统中，作为其主要组成部分之一。
    若干年来，克里特岛的希腊领海，已被用作美英海军与空军的基地。美国统率下的空军与海军，不久又将举行大规模的演习。非常明显的，在希腊进行的这种疯狂的军事行动与战略行动，是希腊人民致命的危险。
    美国人企图利用希腊人民进行他们正在准备的反苏战争。但是，他们犯了重大的错误。希特勒以前恰恰就犯过同样的错误。就象在一九四一年——一九四四年间，希特勒不能够调派一个希腊人去打苏联那样，美英帝国主义者将不能够强迫一个希腊人去攻打人民民主国家和社会主义国家。就象一九四五年希腊共产党人挫败了当时保皇法西斯正在准备侵略阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的计划那样，希腊共产党在现在和将来，也同样保持着它的坚定而始终不渝的决心。希腊人民决不对苏联和人民民主国家作战。
    美国侵略者和保皇法西斯想把我国拖向军事冒险的任何企图，对保皇法西斯与美国侵略者来说，将是他们在希腊的坟墓。
    现在，只有团结着全体人民的民主阵线，才能领导希腊走上和平劳动、民主、独立与和平的大道，走上使希腊参加以苏联为首的、为和平与民主而斗争的世界人民阵线的大道。
    我们当前的任务，就是也要在希腊建立和平统一阵线，因为在美国占领的条件下，希腊比其他国家更加受到变为战场与炮灰供应者的威胁。希腊只有站到世界和平与民主阵营里去。
    希腊共产党及其党员面临着的任务，就是重新站在争取一切人民力量之民主团结的斗士们的最前列。
    共产党员们继续他们的活动。他们组织着工人、职员、农民、手工业工人、残废者，并领导他们进行争取和平的斗争。他们也在军队中、在数十万动员起来的人民子弟中进行活动，并且组织他们进行反对美国占领，反对保皇法西斯的斗争。他们组织并领导青年和妇女为反对新战争、争取更加美好的生活而斗争。
    任何事情都不能粉碎我国人民的意志，他们过去曾经战斗过、现在正在战斗着、而且将来还要进行战斗，直到获得胜利。山里游击队的英勇斗争，就是警告和经常提醒美国与保皇法西斯：他们不能作出任何暴行而逍遥法外，或者进行反人民的行动。
    我国人民的斗争，只可能有一个结局，那就是出现一个摆脱了美国占领者与法西斯主义的、自由、民主和爱好和平的希腊——作为以伟大而不可战胜的苏联为领袖与榜样的各民族的民主大家庭中平等的一员。
