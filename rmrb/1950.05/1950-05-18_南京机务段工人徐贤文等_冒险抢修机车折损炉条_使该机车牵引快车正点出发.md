Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th: Workers Xu Xianwen, a locomotive dispatcher, Xu Ziming, a mechanic, and Wang Yongfu, a mechanic foreman, from the Nanjing Locomotive Depot of the Shanghai Railway Administration, risked their lives to climb into the firebox of a locomotive to repair damaged grate bars, enabling the locomotive to pull Express Train No. 23 and depart on time. On the night of May 3rd, at 20:30, the Shanghai Locomotive Depot's model locomotive (P5, No. 101) arrived in Nanjing and entered the depot at 20:45. At 21:25, Zhao Wenzhi, the on-duty depot driver, discovered that one-third of the second grate bar on the front left side of the locomotive was broken. As there were no boilermakers on the night shift, locomotive dispatcher Xu Xianwen and mechanic Xu Ziming volunteered to undertake the repairs. They first used wet coal to seal off the raging fire in the firebox, and then together climbed into the firebox, which was over 200 degrees Celsius, to carry out the repairs. Because they lacked experience in this type of repair work, they were unable to fix it after 15 minutes. By this time, Xu Xianwen felt as if his whole body was on fire, he was dizzy, his heart was pounding, and he felt suffocated in his mouth. Although the workmates outside the fire door were shouting for them to come out quickly, Xu Xianwen and Xu Ziming persisted in working in the firebox until both of them felt extreme difficulty in breathing before climbing out of the firebox to rest. Mechanic foreman Wang Yongfu took over from them and continued the repairs for 15 minutes, but still couldn't fix it. By this time it was already 22:50, and it was getting close to the departure time of 0:04 for the locomotive to pull Express Train No. 23. Disregarding his fatigue, Xu Xianwen, together with Xu Ziming, carefully studied the repair method again, re-entered the firebox, quickly straightened the other grate bars, added a new grate bar, and finally completed all the repairs at 23:10, enabling the locomotive to pull Express Train No. 23 to depart from Nanjing on time.

　　南京机务段工人徐贤文等
　　冒险抢修机车折损炉条   
    使该机车牵引快车正点出发
    【新华社上海十六日电】上海铁路管理局南京机务段机调员徐贤文、机匠徐子明、机匠领班王永富等三人冒着生命危险爬入机车火室内抢修折损的炉条，使该机车牵引的二十三次快车正点出发。五月三号夜二十点三十分上海机务段模范机车（Ｐ五、一○一）号到达南京，二十点四十五分入库房。二十一点二十五分值班库内司机赵文治发现该机车左前方第二根炉条折损三分之一。当时因夜班没有锅炉匠，机调员徐贤文和机匠徐子明便自告奋勇担任修理。他们先用湿煤把火室内烈火封住，然后一同爬进二百多度高温的火室内进行修理。他们二人因对该项修理工作缺少经验，经十五分钟后仍未修好。当时徐贤文已感觉浑身似火烧，头昏，心跳，口腔窒息。虽然火门外的工友们都大声喊他们快出来，但徐贤文、徐子明却仍在火室内坚持工作，直至两个人都感到呼吸极端困难时才爬出火室休息。机匠领班王永富接替他们继续修理了十五分钟，但仍未修好。这时已经是二十二点五十分钟，距离该机车必须牵引二十三次快车零点零四分的发车时间已近。徐贤文不顾疲劳，与徐子明再仔细研究了修理的办法，再次进入火室，迅速将其他炉条弄直，再加上新炉条，终于二十三点十分全部修理好，使机车牵引二十三次快车正点于南京发车。
