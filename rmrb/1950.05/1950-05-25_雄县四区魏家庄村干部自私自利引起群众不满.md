　　Selfish and Self-Serving Village Cadres in Weijiazhuang Village, Fourth District of Xiong County, Arouse Public Dissatisfaction

　　Weijiazhuang Village, Fourth District of Xiong County, Hebei Province, although situated on relatively high terrain, also suffered from flooding last year, with about 50% of its cultivated land affected. In order to take care of the farmers' livelihoods, the government issued instructions to reduce or exempt agricultural taxes: stipulating that those flooded over 70% would not be subject to agricultural tax, and those flooded less than 30% would be taxed according to the full amount. At the same time, based on the actual situation, the village was granted two exemptions of agricultural tax totaling fifty to sixty thousand catties. The farmers expressed satisfaction with the government's instructions.

　　However, in reality, the farmers did not benefit. Most of those exempted were village cadres and those closely related to them. For example, village cadre Wang Xisan had a plot of land located on Duzhuang Road in the northwest of the village, which was actually flooded by 30%, but he reported it as being flooded by 70%. Thus, this plot of land was not subject to agricultural tax. His family of more than ten people cultivated forty to fifty mu of land and was not severely affected by the disaster, yet they only had to pay over two hundred catties of agricultural tax. In contrast, a family of seven dependents of revolutionary soldiers cultivated twenty-eight mu of land, with six mu flooded, but they actually paid over eight hundred catties of agricultural tax. Farmer Zhang Zhensan, with a family of four, cultivated over twenty mu of land, with only three or four mu remaining after the flood. According to regulations, he should not have had to pay agricultural tax, but he still had to hand over thirty-odd catties of agricultural tax. When some farmers raised objections to the village cadres, the cadres not only refused to listen but also scolded them for deliberately causing trouble. As a result, the farmers discussed among themselves, saying, "Let's see what they do if we don't pay agricultural tax." Up to now, not a single grain of agricultural tax has been collected in the village. In addition, during the autumn tax collection in 1948, the village used old scales when collecting grain but used municipal scales when handing it over to the higher authorities. The excess grain disappeared, and no one knows where it went. The farmers are also very dissatisfied with this matter.

　　A similar situation occurred during the distribution of houses in the land reform. For example, Tong Yushu, the acting secretary of Xiong County (a native of Weizhuang), had eight brick rooms with a courtyard and was allocated an additional two and a half brick rooms and more than four fen of land for a foundation. However, Gao Deyuan, a military dependent, originally had only one and a half dilapidated earthen rooms and was only allocated three dilapidated rooms. When the military dependent raised objections, the village cadres actually replied, "You already had a house to live in, and allocating these three rooms is good enough. You can tear them down and build new ones. Are you still not satisfied!" Therefore, the farmers are all dissatisfied.

　　Editor's Note: The unfair and unreasonable practices of the village cadres of Weijiazhuang Village, Fourth District of Xiong County, in collecting agricultural tax and distributing houses are extremely inappropriate. If these phenomena are completely accurate, we believe that such village cadres should be removed from their positions, and the cadres who made mistakes should apologize to the masses and correct the unfair handling of these matters. We hope that the Xiong County government and the Fourth District government will investigate this matter and provide this newspaper with a response.

### 雄县四区魏家庄村干部自私自利引起群众不满

　　雄县四区魏家庄村干部自私自利引起群众不满
    河北省雄县四区魏家庄，虽然地势较高，去年也遭了水灾，耕地涝了百分之五十左右。政府为了照顾农民生活，发出减免公粮的指示：规定涝百分之七十以上的就不征收公粮，涝百分之三十以下的即照数征收。同时又根据实际情况，将本村公粮两次免征五、六万斤。农民对政府的指示都表示满意。
    但是实际上农民却并没有得到好处。被免征的多数是村干部以及与干部关系密切的人家。譬如村干部王喜三有一块坐落在村西北杜庄道的地，实际涝了百分之三十，他却报涝了百分之七十。这样，这块地就摊不着公粮了。他家十余口人，种地四五十亩，受灾并不重，结果才摊公粮二百余斤。一家抗属七口人，种地二十八亩，涝了六亩，却实缴公粮八百余斤。农民张振三，四口人，种地二十余亩，涝的只剩下三四亩，按规定可不交公粮，但却还拿出公粮三十来斤。有的农民向村干部提出意见，村干部不但不接受，反而骂人家故意捣乱。于是农民议论纷纷地说：“我们不纳公粮，看他们怎么办。”一直到现在，该村公粮一粒也征收不上来。此外，一九四八年的秋征，村中收粮时用老秤收，交给上级时却用市秤。多余的粮食，也不知到那里去了。农民对这件事也很不满意。
    在土地改革分房子时，也有这种情形。举个例子来说，雄县代理秘书佟聿书（魏庄人）有场和院子的砖房八间，又分了砖房两间半、地基四分多；而军属高德元，原来只有坏土房一间半，却只分了三间坏房。军属提出意见，村干部竟答复说：“你原来有房住，分给你这样房三间，你拆了另盖多好。你还嫌不够！”因此农民们都不满意。

    编者按：雄县四区魏家庄村干部，在征收公粮和分配房屋中，这样不公平、不合理的做法，是极不应该的。如果这些现象是完全确实的，我们认为这样的村干部就应该被撤职，并由犯错误的干部，向群众认错，纠正处理不公的现象。希望雄县县政府和四区区政府检查此事，给本报一个答复。
