　　How to Organize a Reading Group?
    How to Enjoy Subscription Discounts?
    Since the publication of the "Measures for Preferential Subscription to Newspapers by Reading Groups" in this newspaper on April 7th, readers from various places have raised many questions about reading groups. After organizing them, we will answer them one by one as follows:
    Q: The measures stipulate: "Any group of three or more people can form a reading group." If a family, including wife and children, already has three or more people and has already organized, can it be considered a reading group?
    A: The tasks of a reading group are to discuss the important content of the newspaper, publicize it to the masses, and regularly write to the newspaper office about important situations and opinions among the masses, as well as the work of the newspaper sales team among the masses. Therefore, any organized group (whether it is a family or not), that carries out work according to the tasks of the reading group, can become a reading group of this newspaper and enjoy the preferential treatment of this newspaper for reading groups.
    Q: We three people have formed a reading group, one of whom is a carpenter and one is a farmer, neither of whom are literate. Can they be counted as group members and enjoy discount benefits?
    A: It is a good way to promote newspaper reading work for illiterate worker-peasant cadres and worker-peasant masses to form reading groups with other people who can read newspapers. Such reading groups should enjoy the same preferential treatment as other reading groups.
    Q: Is there a limit to the number of copies of newspapers subscribed to by reading groups?
    A: There is a limit to the number of newspapers subscribed to by reading groups, which shall not exceed the number of group members, i.e., each person can only subscribe to one copy.
    Q: Can reading groups subscribe to the People's Daily at private sales agents? If so, can they enjoy preferential treatment?
    A: Reading groups must be approved by this newspaper and the post office. Private sales agents do not have the right to approve. Therefore, reading groups can only subscribe to newspapers at the post office.
    Q: After a reading group member transfers jobs, how can they enjoy discount benefits?
    A: Any member of this newspaper's reading group who has been approved and can regularly maintain contact with this newspaper according to the reading group method, regardless of job transfer or relocation, as long as they establish or join a reading group in the new place, will continue to be a member of this newspaper's reading group.
    Q: Who should approve the reading groups organized by post office employees? Are there any differences between them and other reading groups?
    A: Reading groups organized by post office employees have the same rights and obligations as other reading groups. Post offices of the third class or above can be approved by the person in charge of the bureau, but they must also write a certificate letter and detailed list to the newspaper office.
    Q: If governments, organs, organizations, troops, factories, schools, etc. subscribe to newspapers and copy a list of all personnel in the organization, calculating one group for every three people, can they enjoy an 80% discount?
    A: This is not possible. To become a reading group, the first step is to organize the personnel of the organs, troops, factories, and schools, elect a reading group leader, and write down the name, age, gender, position, and mailing address of each group member and send it to the newspaper office or local post office. Only after approval by the newspaper office or local post office can newspapers be subscribed according to the preferential treatment method. The second step is to establish a reading system after subscribing to the newspaper, regularly discuss and publicize the content of the newspaper, and regularly report to the newspaper office the opinions of the reading group and the masses on the newspaper and other work (at least once a month). Only in this way can it be considered a sound reading group.

### 怎样组织读报小组？  如何享受订报优待？

　　怎样组织读报小组？
    如何享受订报优待？
    自从四月七日本报刊载优待读报小组订阅报纸办法以后，各地读者提出许多关于读报小组的问题，经我们加以整理后，逐一解答如下：
    问：该办法规定：“凡三人以上即可组织一个读报小组”。如果一个家庭连老婆孩子算在一起，已满三个人或超过三个人，且已组织起来，可否算为一个读报小组呢？
    答：读报小组的任务是：讨论报纸的重要内容，并向群众作宣传；经常将群众中的重要情况与意见以及卖报组在群众中工作的情形写给报社。因此，凡是组织起来（不管是一家人也好，不是一家人也好），并按照读报小组的任务去进行工作的，一律可以成为本报读报小组，享受本报对于读报小组的优待。
    问：我们三个人组织一个读报小组，其中有一个是木匠，一个是农民，都不识字，能否算组员和享受折扣优待？
    答：不识字的工农干部及工农群众与其他能够读报的人在一起组成读报小组，这是推广读报工作的好方法。这样的读报小组，应与其他读报小组享受同样的优待。
    问：读报小组订阅报纸的份数，有无限制？
    答：读报小组订阅报纸的份数是有限制的，最高不得超过组员人数，即每人只能订一份。
    问：读报小组可否在私人代销处订阅人民日报？如果可以，能否享受优待？
    答；读报小组必须经过本报和邮局批准，私人代销处没有批准的权利。所以读报小组只能到邮局去订报。
    问：读报组员调动工作后，如何享受折扣优待？
    答：凡已批准为本报读报小组的组员，能经常按照读报小组办法与本报取得连系的，无论调动工作或迁移住所，只要在新地方又成立或参加读报小组时，仍继续为本报读报小组的组员。
    问：邮局员工组织的读报小组，要由谁来批准？是否和其他的读报小组有不同之处呢？
    问：邮局员工组织的读报小组和其他读报小组有同等权利和义务。三等以上的邮局由该局负责人批准即可，但同样要给报社写证明信及详细名单。
    问：各级人民政府、机关、团体、部队、工厂、学校等所订阅之报纸，把本机关所有人员名单抄一份给你们，按三个人算一组，是否可以享受八折优待呢？
    答：这样做是不行的。要想成为读报小组，第一步：必须先把机关、部队、工厂、学校的人员组织起来，选出读报组长，并把每个组员的姓名、年岁、性别、职别、通讯处缮写一份，送交本社或当地邮局，经本社或当地邮局批准后才能按照优待办法订阅报纸。第二步，订到报纸后，必须规定阅报制度，经常讨论、宣传报纸内容，并向报社经常报告读报小组中及群众中对于报纸及其它各种工作的意见（每月至少一次）。只有这样，才能算是一个健全的读报小组。
