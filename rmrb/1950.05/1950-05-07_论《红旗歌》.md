　　On the "Red Flag Song"
　　Zhou Yang
　　Editor's Note: This is the author's speech at the "Red Flag Song" symposium held by the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles' Criticism Group on April 22nd. It is also published in "Wenyi Bao" issue 16.
　　"Red Flag Song" has been performed in cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Chongqing, and Lanzhou, and has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the audience, especially the workers. It has been performed 148 times in Shanghai and is still continuing; the performance in Nanjing has also broken the record for the most popular drama in the area.
　　Is the success of this play accidental?
　　It is necessary to make a relatively appropriate and correct evaluation of this play, not only based on its performance effect, but mainly based on a specific analysis of the ideological and artistic value of the play itself. Especially because there are various different critical opinions about this play, and some critical opinions are inappropriate and incorrect, it is even more necessary to make a relatively appropriate and correct evaluation of it.
　　It must be affirmed that "Red Flag Song" is a good play. It is good because: it is the first play to describe workers' production; it uses the power of art to praise the workers' high labor enthusiasm in production competitions, criticize the backward elements among the workers, and also criticize the incorrect attitude of some activists who do not patiently unite and educate backward workers, but only ridicule and attack them; it praises the democratic style in administrative management and criticizes the bureaucratic and commandist style. All this is achieved through the depiction of vivid personalities. The author has shown excellent talent in the sculpting of characters and the use of language. This is why this play has the power to educate and move people; no matter what shortcomings it still has, even relatively serious shortcomings, we must give this play a high evaluation.
　　The story of the play takes place when the People's Liberation War turned into a victorious offensive, and the leading forces of the people's revolution began to enter the cities from the countryside. The first important issue we encountered when we entered the city was how to rely on the workers, restore and develop industrial production, and learn to manage industry. On this issue, we had to overcome a special difficulty: since our Party retreated to the countryside after the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927, and persisted in the struggle in the countryside for twenty years, during these twenty years the enemy always occupied the cities, thus causing a long period of separation between the Communist Party and its own class - the working class, so that when we victoriously returned to the city, not only were many workers affected by the enemy's long-term deception and propaganda and could not immediately recognize their own political party; at the same time, many of our cadres, most of whom were of peasant origin or had struggled in the countryside for a long time, also once felt estranged and "incompatible" with their own class masses, the urban industrial workers. Many cadres once lacked a clear idea of "relying on the working class"; and if this fundamental idea and fundamental stand are not established, we have no way to restore and develop industrial production and manage industry well. This ideological ambiguity was promptly reminded by the Party. After liberation, the high degree of consciousness and enthusiasm shown by the working class on the production front, and the various model deeds they created, fully demonstrated the greatness of the Chinese working class, and also greatly strengthened the idea of "relying on the working class" of many of our cadres.
　　"Red Flag Song" was the first to bring to the stage the high labor enthusiasm shown by workers in production competitions and the problems that occurred in production competitions.
　　The play opens with a lively scene of production competition. The female workers are completely involved in the red flag competition craze. When Old Liu, the leader of the fine yarn production team and also the director of the trade union branch, said:
　　"These young girls value the red flag more than their lives!"
　　A female worker immediately retorted:
　　"We started the competition for active production ourselves, and we earned the red flag with our own sweat, why shouldn't we value it!"
　　These female workers worked without eating or drinking to win the red flag. As Administrator Peng said: "Half a year ago, before liberation, they never dreamed of having such a good time, and they never thought they would have such great enthusiasm in their lives." Once the workers are liberated, their political consciousness will be quickly enlightened and improved; their hidden enthusiasm and energy for labor and creation will gush out like an endless stream of springs, and with this energy they will be able to change the face of the world and create historical miracles. In the competition, a large number of activists emerged, and they drew a clear line between themselves and the backward elements. All workers, advanced and backward, will be strictly tested in the competition.
　　Below is an interesting dialogue between Xianni, a young activist, and Xiaomeigu, an equally young but blindly following backward element:
　　“Xian... Now the factory is our own, we work for ourselves, actively produce, support the front, and it's so glorious to get the red flag!
　　Xiaomeigu: Glory? - Glory can't be eaten or drunk, what's the use!
　　Xianni: More work, more gain, don't you know? If you get more red flags, you'll get a bonus at the end of the year!
　　………………
　　Xiaomeigu: There are still several months until the end of the year, who knows if it will be issued by then? Didn't you hear what my sister Fen said, anyway, we know that getting the red flag won't earn us an extra catty of millet, and not getting the red flag won't get us half a ticket less, just working hard? - We won't be fools!"
　　What different views on the red flag! Here, the completely different political and labor attitudes of the activists and backward elements among the workers are displayed. One regards the factory as their own, and regards getting the red flag as the most glorious thing; one still treats the state-owned factory with the attitude of workers towards private factory owners in the past, and still holds the old idea of earning more money and doing less work; in other words, one has already begun to have a sense of ownership, while the other still does not have this feeling at all; she still maintains the old habits and old ideas.
　　The author made a dramatic arrangement here: the quarrel between the two little ghosts is just a preliminary battle between the activists and the backward elements, and then the "two generals" of both sides appear, Zhang Damei, who is called "blindly active," and Ma Fenjie, who is called "hornet's nest," and they launch a series of struggles around the red flag competition, becoming the central conflict of the play. The author consistently runs through such an idea from beginning to end: the advanced elements among the workers must patiently unite, strive for, and educate the backward elements.
　　What does it mean to "rely on the working class"? The main thing is to rely on the workers' consciousness and organization. For the backward elements among the workers, their political consciousness must be enlightened and their labor enthusiasm must be encouraged. For the activists among the workers who already have awareness, their level of awareness must be further improved, and their spirit of unity and mutual assistance in production labor must be improved.
　　In the play, the outstanding representative of the backward workers is Ma Fenjie, who is scolded as a "stubborn fortress" by the activists. What kind of person is Ma Fenjie? According to the author's introduction, she is "a character distorted by the exploitation, oppression, and humiliation of the old world." She was unreasonably fired twice during the rule of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang, so she recorded "great hatred" for the factory. After liberation, in her opinion, "Today is liberated, but aren't the workers still poor workers, aren't the assistants still assistants, aren't people still treating us as draft animals?" Especially for Assistant Wan Guoying, who fired her before liberation and still looked down on the workers after liberation, she has always held a grudge. She completely uses the old perspective to look at the factory and management personnel after liberation. "Which time hasn't the factory been towards the management, can it still be towards us poor workers?" Naturally, she is against the competition. "What competition, red flag, isn't it just to trick you into doing more work?!" In the mass upsurge of competition, she felt isolated. "The competition has only been two weeks, only twenty days in total, and you've made me stand nowhere, stand nowhere, nowhere to hide, and nowhere to hide?!... You treat me like a manure truck, who hates whoever sees me, and where I go, it stinks?!" Under this circumstance, she even more often absents herself from work, runs the car, and even throws white flowers, until finally she throws down her apron and badge and walks out of the factory.
　　Is Ma Fenjie such a character realistic? Regardless of the author's excessive rendering of this character's lonely and stubborn personality, this character's backward ideological psychology has its social roots and has a certain representativeness. The relationship between workers and factory owners has always been one of oppression and being oppressed, exploitation and being exploited. Although the staff belongs to a part of the working class, because their work, position, living conditions, and ideology are different from those of the workers, the relationship between workers and staff, especially some upper-level staff who are closer to the capitalists, was often one of opposition in the past. The factory, which originally belonged to the bureaucratic capitalists, now belongs to the people's state, so the relationship between the workers and the factory has undergone a fundamental change: "The factory is the workers' own." But to make every worker aware of and adapt to this change, it requires him to recognize ideologically that the workers are the leading class of the country, and to reach this understanding based on his own personal experience. The relationship between workers and staff also needs to be coordinated through a period of united effort. Comrade Xiao Yin, in his article reviewing "Red Flag Song" (published in "Wenyi Bao" issue 11), believes that workers like Ma Fenjie who were "deeply oppressed in the old society" "should easily accept the ideas of the new society, and easily understand the essential difference between the new society and the old society." He doubts that in a factory half a year after liberation, there would still be a "stubborn" and "backward" character like Ma Fenjie, so he feels that "the character of Ma Fenjie is unrealistic and lacks a social basis." "Should" is one thing, "possible" is another. In just half a year after liberation, when the workers' political consciousness has not been universally improved, and the workers' material welfare has not been fundamentally improved, it is entirely possible and realistic for workers to have "stubborn" and "backward" ideas like Ma Fenjie, and it is not surprising. Even today, it is still the case.
　　Recognizing the essential difference between the new society and the old society (not the superficial difference) is not as easy as Comrade Xiao Yin said. It is true that Ma Fenjie was oppressed and resisted in the old society; but that was only a kind of individual anarchist resistance. This kind of resistance to the old society is not entirely in tune with the new society, and sometimes it becomes an obstacle to the integration of individuals with the new society. This situation is common. It takes a process to understand and adapt to the new society. We must have sufficient estimation of the bad habits and bad ideas left to the people by the old society, and use long-term education work to change them. Comrade Cai Tianxin, in his article "The Theme of 'Red Flag Song'" (published in the same issue of "Wenyi Bao"), also similarly ignores the bad influence that the old society left on the people's minds. He said: "In the old society, under the cruel oppression of the rulers, in order to resist, the working class also learned to use their own strength and wisdom to oppose the ruling class, slack off and sabotage, but in general they were united, not workers harming and slandering each other. Even the most unconscious workers still talk about some loyalty, and are unwilling to do things that harm others and benefit themselves. Only a few rogue workers contaminated with the consciousness of the exploiting class specialize in slandering others, and such people are mostly lackeys of the rulers." Here, Comrade Cai Tianxin only sees that the development of large industry and the unity of the interests of the working class promote the unity of the workers, but he does not see how the various rulers of the old society use methods such as bribery and division to undermine the unity of the workers; and how harmful the guilds and sects among the workers were to the unity of the workers. One hundred years ago, the slogan "Workers of the world, unite!" put forward in the "Communist Manifesto" is still the goal of the common struggle of the working class all over the world today. Because the working class all over the world, which has been divided by various national, regional, religious, and political reasons, must unite more and more extensively under the common political direction through various concrete actions, which is a great task of world history. If the workers are already "united," then is it necessary for the vanguard of the working class - the Communist Party - to make great efforts to carry out unity and education work among the broad masses of workers? No wonder, in Comrade Cai Tianxin's view, since Ma Fenjie is so backward, no, she is simply "lawless," she should be subjected to "organizational punishment and disciplinary sanctions," instead of trying so hard to unite and strive for her; he believes that this kind of unity is unprincipled. He demands a backward worker with the organizational discipline that we require of a Communist Party member, and therefore makes a ruthless judgment on her. Is this way of handling this character correct, whether artistically or practically?
　　If the working class wants to unite and lead the people of the whole country, it must first unite itself. Activists should become the backbone of unity. But the most common problem that activists are prone to make is individual prominence and detachment from the masses; and this problem is particularly easy to reveal in competition. Damei is such a typical representative. Meilan's departmentalism is just another manifestation of this kind of individual heroism. Therefore, in production competitions, it is necessary to emphasize the combination of individual models and collective models, the advanced helping the backward, and the heroes leading everyone, which is the truly new collectivist heroism. All individual prominence, arrogance, departmentalism, etc., are also bad habits and bad ideas left to us by the old society. The play appropriately criticizes the character of Zhang Damei, which is entirely necessary and has educational significance.
　　Chairman Mao said in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship":
　　"The people... educate and transform themselves with democratic methods, so that they can get rid of the influence of reactionaries at home and abroad (this influence is still very large now, and will exist for a long time, and cannot be eliminated quickly), transform their bad habits and bad ideas from the old society, so as not to go to the wrong path guided by the reactionaries, and continue to move forward, towards socialist and communist society."
　　Here, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: first, it is necessary to fully estimate that the bad influence that the reactionary rulers have given to the people's minds is very large and will exist for a long time; second, the people must use democratic methods to educate and transform themselves.
　　The main key to enlightening and improving the workers' consciousness and enthusiasm lies in the democratization of management; the factory management personnel must follow the mass line in their work and have a democratic style. "Red Flag Song" shows the struggle between the new labor attitude (including unity and mutual assistance) and the old labor attitude of the workers on the production front, and also shows the struggle between two different styles in factory management, namely the democratic style represented by Administrator Peng and the bureaucratic and commandist style represented by Assistant Wan, and these two struggles are intertwined, which constitutes the entire theme of "Red Flag Song."
　　What is the ideological root of bureaucracy and commandism? The main thing is "looking down on the masses." Wan Guoying simply does not believe in the workers' awareness. He said:
　　"...Workers are born to want to earn more money and do less work, and management wants to increase production, improve quality, and reduce costs. Management and workers are fundamentally contradictory."
　　"...If you really want to increase production and reach the standard number, as long as the management makes plans, issues orders, has the courage, has confidence, checks and manages diligently, and punishes mistakes, the task will be completed, and there is no need to mobilize the masses, and there is no need to let them manage themselves!"
　　In his view, what "democratic management" and what "production competition" are just "asking for trouble." This kind of thinking and style of Assistant Wan is quite common among the old technical personnel in the newly liberated cities. Comrade Xiao Yin believes that "this character is also not realistic enough." He said: "According to the general situation, after the liberation of the cities, the workers have grievance meetings, and the personnel with bad styles will definitely be criticized and educated by the masses, even if they still have the old dross in their minds, they know that the Communist Party is against oppressing the workers, and they will never dare to do it so blatantly (like Wan Guoying). Even if old ideas occasionally emerge and oppress the workers, the workers will never think that his oppressive behavior is the will of the factory." The reasons given here are insufficient. In general, after the liberation of the cities, the workers did not have grievance meetings. And the old style of the old personnel has not changed so easily; they are accustomed to that set of old management methods, which is inseparable from their entire thinking and experience. The "old dross" that remains in their minds is not just an "occasional emergence," but a factor that often plays a role in their work. The bureaucratic and commandist style like that of Assistant Wan exists not only in the old personnel of the newly liberated cities, but also in some Communist Party cadres in the old liberated areas. As Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in his recent speech celebrating May Day when talking about the shortcomings and mistakes in our work: "The most serious mistake is the mistake of commandism." We must oppose the erroneous style of commandism of our cadres in production work and all other work. Comrade Cai Tianxin does not start from this actual situation, but thinks that Wan Guoying is "a comrade with good qualities," as if his commandist mistake is just a "shortcoming" in his work style, which is not serious; as if what we want to oppose in our work today is mainly not the commandist style of the cadres, but the "backwardness" of the people. Is this correct?
　　"Red Flag Song" criticizes Assistant Wan's commandist style and praises Administrator Peng's democratic style, which is entirely necessary. Naturally, Administrator Peng is not a complete embodiment of the democratization of management. But in any case, his style is democratic, and he treats his class brothers not with "glaring eyes," but with full enthusiasm and a very caring attitude. He cares about their vital interests; he patiently persuades and educates them on their shortcomings and mistakes, doing his best. Even Ma Fenjie cannot help but say that he is good: "You treat me like a human being," this is a word of gratitude from the heart.
　　Of course, it is not enough to rely solely on the democratic style of individual management personnel and the method of patient persuasion and education to launch and organize a production competition. Production competition is a conscious movement of the broad masses of workers, and it is a huge and complex organizational work in administrative management. Without the strong political leadership of the Party and the active activities of the trade unions, and without the good cooperation of the Party, the trade unions, and the administrative organizations in their work, the competition cannot be launched, and even if it is launched, it cannot be sustained. The main and relatively serious shortcoming of "Red Flag Song" is that it does not well show the role of the Party's leadership and the activities of the trade union in the factory. It is true that Administrator Peng, Old Liu, and Jin Fang are all representatives of the Party, but the collective leadership of the Party is not seen, only Administrator Peng is seen "fighting alone." The image of the Party member seems powerless. The Shanghai workers, who have a glorious tradition of struggle, feel that Jin Fang is too weak and does not meet the level of the Communist Party member they idealize. Their criticism is very correct. The activities of the trade union are also too few, and it has almost completely become an appendage of the administration. An important activity of Old Liu, the director of the trade union branch, is to deliver and distribute noodles to Ma Fenjie's home, and return her apron and badge, and notify her to return to the factory. This matter caused a fierce change in Ma Fenjie's thoughts and emotions, and made her embark on the final transformation. The trade union's concern for the workers' material welfare, and the improvement of the workers' living conditions under possible conditions, are of great significance for enlightening and improving the workers' political consciousness and consolidating their labor discipline. However, as a Communist school, the trade union should seize every opportunity to conduct class political education for the workers; Old Liu, as the director of the trade union branch, has not fulfilled this responsibility. He has not conducted a single serious criticism of Ma Fenjie's mistakes. Not only him, but also Administrator Peng and Jin Fang, in treating Ma Fenjie's mistakes, have been very patient in persuading her, but in some places they have shown too much emotional accommodation. In terms of this shortcoming in the method of unity and education, Comrade Cai Tianxin's criticism is correct. The reason why the labor discipline of the new society is different from the labor discipline of the old society is that it is based on the consciousness of the broad masses of workers; it is first established and consolidated by means of persuasion and education. But when the workers' level of consciousness is uneven, it cannot be limited to persuasion and encouragement, and necessary coercive measures must also be taken to deal with those who are lazy and sabotage labor discipline, although Ma Fenjie is not such a person, she is not really intent on sabotaging production.
　　In "Red Flag Song," the factory's regular democratic management system has not been established. This system must be formally established through organizational forms such as the factory management committee and the workers' representative conference. This factory is only taking the first step in the democratization of management. The competition in "Red Flag Song" also takes the initial and even spontaneous form of the production competition movement. We see that once the workers are liberated, they immediately burst out with unprecedented labor enthusiasm, and this enthusiasm is vigorous, but it has not yet condensed to form a new production order and new labor discipline. Many scenes in "Red Flag Song" give the impression that the workers are not in intense production in this competition, but are only arguing and quarreling, which is certainly to unfold the ideological struggle of the characters in the play, and because the stage limits the positive expression of the production process, but it also reflects that the factory's production leadership has not yet been fully incorporated into the regular. The "Red Flag" competition is also simply relying on the workers' production enthusiasm and improving labor intensity, and has not yet turned to saving raw materials, reducing costs, invention and creation, and improving technology. Now our industrial production and our production competition have advanced a long way! In the Northeast, a mass new record movement has been launched. This movement has developed from individual new records to collective new records, and from simply improving labor intensity new records to improving technical operations, production safety, and invention and creation new records. Because the competition in "Red Flag Song" is still in its early stages, the progress and transformation of Zhang Damei, Ma Fenjie, and Wan Guoying, who have progressed and transformed in this competition, are naturally only preliminary and the foundation is not solid, and more tests are waiting for them in front of them.
　　"Red Flag Song" precisely reflects the initial situation and shortcomings on our industrial production front. The author naturally did not reflect the situation at that time completely, and he did not see farther than reality.
　　"Red Flag Song" does not sufficiently show the role of the Party's leadership and trade union activities in the factory, but excessively and inappropriately describes Ma Fenjie's lonely and stubborn character, so that the serious ideological struggle in industrial production becomes the conflict between the two different characters of Damei and Fenjie in some places, which forms another aspect of the shortcomings of this play and weakens the educational significance of this play. Ma Fenjie's transformation has already been completed in the third act, but in order to show Ma Fenjie's special character, the author deliberately created suspense, making the audience worry and wonder if she has been transformed at all, and when they see her finally expressing her attitude so enthusiastically and excitedly, the audience's psychology is greatly comforted and encouraged. This dramatic effect precisely shows the harmful artificial traces in artistic creation. Comrade Xiao Yin's criticism of some excessive and inappropriate descriptions of Ma Fenjie's character is correct.
　　My opinions on "Red Flag Song" are roughly the above. If there is anything wrong, please correct me.

### 论《红旗歌》

　　论《红旗歌》
    周扬
    编者按：这是作者在全国文联文艺批评小组四月二十二日《红旗歌》座谈会上的发言，同时登载在《文艺报》第十六期。
    《红旗歌》在北京、天津、上海、南京、重庆、兰州等城市陆续演出，受到了广大观众的热烈欢迎，特别是工人们的欢迎。在上海已连演一百四十八场，现在还在继续；在南京的演出也突破了从来该地话剧卖座的纪录。
    这个剧本的成功，是偶然的吗？
    对于这个剧本，不只根据它的演出效果，而主要地根据剧本本身思想艺术价值的具体分析，作出一个比较恰当和正确的评价，是必要的。特别是因为关于这个剧本已有各种不同的批评的意见，有些批评的意见是不恰当、不正确的，对它作一比较恰当和正确的评价，就更有必要了。
    必须肯定，《红旗歌》是一个好剧本。它之所以好，就在于：它是第一个描写工人生产的剧本；它用艺术的力量，表扬了工人在生产竞赛中的高度劳动热情，批评了工人中的落后分子，也批评了某些积极分子对待落后工人不去耐心团结教育而只是讥讽打击的那种不正确的态度；表扬了行政管理上的民主作风，批评了官僚主义、命令主义的作风。这一切都通过了活生生的个性的描写。作者在人物性格的雕塑与语言的运用上显示了优秀的才能。这就是为什么，这个剧本具有教育人、感动人的力量；不管它还有某些缺点甚至比较严重的缺点，我们要给予这剧本以较高的评价。
    剧本的故事是发生在人民解放战争转入胜利进攻，人民革命领导力量开始从农村进入城市的时候。我们进入城市第一个遇到的重要问题就是如何依靠工人，恢复与发展工业生产，学会管理工业。在这个问题上，我们曾不得不克服一个特殊的困难，就是：由于我们党自一九二七年大革命失败以后，退入农村，在农村坚持斗争二十年之久，在这二十年当中敌人一直占据了城市，因而造成了共产党与自己的阶级——工人阶级长期隔离的状态，以致我们胜利回到城市的时候，不但许多工人受了敌人长期欺骗宣传的影响，对自己的政党不能立刻认识；同时我们的许多干部，他们大都是农民出身或是长期在农村斗争过来的，对于自己的阶级群众、城市产业工人也一度发生了生疏的、“格格不入”的感觉。许多干部曾经缺乏明确的“依靠工人阶级”的思想；而如果这个根本思想、根本立场不建立起来的话，我们是没有办法恢复与发展工业生产，把工业管理好的。这种思想上的模糊，受到了党的及时的提醒。解放以后，工人阶级在生产战线上所表现的高度的自觉性和积极性，及他们所创造的各种模范事迹，充分表现了中国工人阶级的伟大，同时也大大加强了我们许多干部的“依靠工人阶级”的思想。
    《红旗歌》第一次把工人在生产竞赛中所表现的高度的劳动热情及在生产竞赛中所发生的问题搬到了舞台上。
    剧本一开幕就展开了生产竞赛的热烈的场面。女工们完全卷入红旗竞赛的热潮中了。当细纱组生产组长也是工会分会主任的老刘说：
    “这些小闺女们哪，看着那红旗比命还值重哪！”
    一个女工马上答嘴：
    “我们自个儿为了积极生产发动的竞赛，自个儿流汗争来的红旗，为什么不值重呵！”
    这些女工们为了争取红旗，饭不吃、水不喝地干着活。正如彭管理员所说的：“半年以前没解放的时候她们作梦也没想到会过的这么痛快，也没想到这辈子还有这么大心劲儿。”工人们一经解放，他们的政治觉悟就很快得到启发和提高；他们蕴藏的劳动的创造的热情和精力就会像源源不绝的泉水一样喷射出来，他们凭着这股劲儿就能够改变世界的面貌，创造出历史的奇迹。在竞赛中涌现了大批积极分子，他们和落后分子划分了显明的界线。一切工人，前进的和落后的，都将在竞赛中受到严格的考验。
    下面是一个年幼的积极分子仙妮和一个同样年幼的但是盲从的落后分子小美姑之间的一段有趣的对话：
     “仙……这会儿工厂是咱们自个儿的啦，为咱自个干活儿，积极生产，支援前线，得了红旗多光荣呵！
    小光荣？——光荣也吃不的，也喝不的，有什么用呵！
    仙多劳多得，你不知道吗？得红旗多了，到年底还发奖金哪！
    ………………
    小到年底还有好几个月哪，谁知道到时候发不发呀？你们没听我芬姐说呀，反正这会儿我们知道得了红旗也不多挣一斤小米儿，不得红旗也不少拿半张票儿，光图干活儿紧哪？—我们才不当那傻瓜蛋哪！”
    对于红旗的何等不同的看法呵！在这里就显示了工人中的积极分子与落后分子的全然不同的政治态度与劳动态度。一个把工厂看成自己的，把得红旗看成顶光荣的事；一个仍然以过去工人对待私人厂主的态度对待国家工厂，仍然抱着多挣钱，少做活的老主意；换句话说，就是一个已经开始有了主人翁的感觉，一个则还根本没有这种感觉；她仍然保持着旧的习惯和旧的思想。
    作者在这里作了一个戏剧性的安排：两个小鬼的吵嘴不过是积极分子与落后分子两方面的一个前哨战罢了，接着登场的是双方的“两员大将”，被称为“瞎积极”的张大梅与被称为“马蜂窝”的马芬姐，她们围绕红旗竞赛展开了一连串的斗争，成为剧本的中心纠葛。作者从始到终贯串了这样一个思想：就是工人中的前进分子必须耐心地去团结、争取与教育落后的分子。
    所谓“依靠工人阶级”，是什么意思呢？主要就是依靠工人的觉悟性与组织性。对于工人中的落后分子必须启发他的政治觉悟，鼓励他的劳动热情。对于已经有了觉悟的工人中的积极分子必须进一步提高他的觉悟程度，提高他在生产劳动中的团结互助精神。
    剧中作为落后工人的突出的代表的，是被积极分子骂为“顽固堡垒”的马芬姐。马芬姐是怎样一个人呢？据作者的介绍，她是“一个被旧世界的剥削、压榨、凌辱所歪曲了的性格”。她在日寇和国民党统治时期曾两次毫无理由地被开除，因此她给工厂记下了“大仇”。解放了，但在她看来，“今天解放啦，可是工人还不是穷工人，助理员还不是助理员，人家还不是把咱当成拉套牲口的？”特别是对于那位解放前开除过她，解放后还是那样看不起工人的助理员万国英，她一直记着仇。她完全用旧的眼光来看解放后的工厂和管工人员。“没有哪一回工厂不是向着管工的，还能向着咱们穷工人？”对于竞赛，她自然是反对的。“什么竞赛，红旗，还不是哄你们多干活儿？！”在竞赛的群众热潮中，她感到了孤立。“竞赛才不过两个星期，总共也只有二十天，就让你们弄的我站没站处，立没立处，没处藏，也没处躲？！……你们把我当成大粪车子似的，谁见了谁恨，走到哪儿哪儿臭？！”在这种情况下，她就越发旷工、跑车、甚至扔白花，直到最后扔下围腰、证章，走出工厂。
    马芬姐这样的人物是现实的吗？不管作者对于这个人物的孤僻倔强的个性的过份渲染，这个人物的落后思想心理是有它的社会根源的，是有它的一定的代表性的。工人与厂主历来是处于一种压迫与被压迫、剥削与被剥削的关系。职员虽然属于工人阶级的一部分，但由于他们工作职务、生活条件、思想意识比工人不同，因此工人与职员，特别是一些比较更接近资本家的上层职员之间，在过去也常常处于一种对立的关系。原来属于官僚资本家的工厂，现在属于人民的国家所有了，因而工人与工厂的关系发生了根本的变化：“工厂是工人自己的了”。但是要使每个工人意识并且适应这个变化，这就需要他在思想上认识工人是国家的领导阶级，并且根据他亲身的经验来达到这个认识。工人与职员的关系也要经过一番团结的努力才能获得协调。萧殷同志在评《红旗歌》的文章（载《文艺报》第十一期）中，认为像马芬姐那样“在旧社会被压迫得深重”的工人“应该很容易接受新社会的思想，很容易理解新社会与旧社会在本质上的不同”，他怀疑在解放了半年以后的工厂，还会有像马芬姐这样“顽固”“落后”的性格存在的可能，因此他觉得“马芬姐这个人物是不现实的，是缺乏社会基础的”。“应该”是一回事，“可能”又是一回事。在解放不过半年时间，工人的政治觉悟还没有普遍提高，工人物质福利还没有根本改善的情况下，工人中有像马芬姐这样“顽固”“落后”的思想是完全可能的，现实的，并不奇怪的。就在今天也还是如此。
    认识新社会与旧社会的本质的不同（不是表面上的不同），并不是像萧殷同志所说的那样一件容易的事。不错，马芬姐在旧社会受过压迫，反抗过；但那不过是一种个人的无政府主义式的反抗。对旧社会的这种反抗，到了新社会就不完全合拍了，有时反成为个人与新社会结合的障碍。这样的情形是常见的。认识和适应新社会，是需要一个过程的。对于旧社会所遗留给人民的坏习惯和坏思想，我们必须有足够的估计，用长期教育的工作去改变它们。蔡天心同志在“《红旗歌》的主题思想”一文（载同期《文艺报》）中，也同样忽视了旧社会遗留给广大人民思想上的坏影响。他说：“旧社会，工人阶级在统治者的残酷压迫之下，为了反抗，工人也学会运用自己的力量和智慧反对统治阶级，怠工、破坏，但一般的都是团结一心，而不是工人们彼此互相倾轧、诬陷。就是最没有觉悟的工人，也还讲一些义气，而不肯做损人利己的事。只有少数沾染了剥削阶级意识的流氓工人，才专门诬陷别人，而这样人也大都是统治者的狗腿子。”在这里，蔡天心同志只看到了大工业的发展与工人阶级的利害一致，促使工人团结了起来，但他没有看到旧社会的各种统治者如何用收买、分化等等方法来破坏工人的团结；工人中的行帮、宗派，对于工人的团结发生了多么有害的影响。一百年以前，《共产党宣言》中提出的“全世界工人阶级团结起来！”的口号，今天还是全世界工人阶级共同奋斗的目标。因为民族的、地域的、宗教的、政治的种种原因而被分裂了的全世界工人阶级要在共同的政治方向下通过各种具体行动而日益扩大地团结起来，这是一个世界历史性的伟大的任务。如果工人已经“团结一心”了，那还用得着工人阶级的先锋队—共产党用极大的努力在广大工人群众中间去进行团结工作和教育工作吗？难怪在蔡天心同志看来，马芬姐既然那么落后，不，简直是“无法无天”，对于她就应当实行“组织处分与纪律制裁”，而不应当那么委曲求全地去团结和争取她；他认为这种团结是毫无原则的。他以我们所要求于一个共产党员的组织性纪律性来要求一个落后工人，因而对她做出无情的判决。对于这个人物的这种处理方法，无论从艺术上或实际上说，难道是正确的吗？
    工人阶级要团结和领导全国人民必须首先自己团结一致。积极分子应当成为团结的骨干。但是积极分子最容易犯的毛病却恰好是个人突出、脱离群众；而这种毛病在竞赛中就特别容易显露出来。大梅就是这样一个典型的代表者。美兰的本位主义不过是这种个人英雄主义的另一种表现罢了。因此在生产竞赛中必须强调个人模范与集体模范相结合，先进的帮助落后的，英雄带动大家，这才是真正新的集体主义的英雄主义。一切个人突出、骄傲自大、本位主义等等，也都是旧社会所遗留给我们的坏习惯和坏思想。剧本中对张大梅这个人物给予了适当的批评，是完全必要的，有教育意义的。
    毛主席在《论人民民主专政》中说：
    “人民……用民主的方法教育自己和改造自己，使自己脱离内外反动派的影响（这个影响现在还是很大的，并将长时期内存在着，不能很快地消灭）改造自己从旧社会得来的坏习惯和坏思想，不使自己走入反动派指引的错误道路上去，并继续前进，向着社会主义和共产主义社会发展。”
    在这里，毛主席明确指示了：第一，必须充分估计，反动统治者所给与人民思想上的坏影响是很大的，并将长期存在的；第二，人民教育自己和改造自己，必须采用民主的方法。
    要启发和提高工人的自觉性、积极性，主要关键就在管理民主化；工厂管理人员在工作中要走群众路线，要有民主作风。《红旗歌》表现了工人在生产战线上新的劳动态度（包括团结互助）与旧的劳动态度之间的斗争，同时也表现了工厂管理上两种不同的作风，即彭管理员所代表的民主作风与万助理员所代表的官僚主义、命令主义的作风之间的斗争，这两种斗争交错着，就构成了《红旗歌》的全部主题。
    官僚主义、命令主义的思想根源是什么呢？主要就是“看不起群众”。万国英根本不相信工人的觉悟。他说：
    “……工人生成的就是想多挣钱，少干活儿，管理上就是想增加产量，提高质量，减低成本。管理和工人根本是矛盾的。”
    “……真要提高生产，达到标准数，只要管理上订计划，下命令，有魄力，有信心，勤查勤管，有错就罚，就会完成任务，根本用不着发动群众，根本用不着让她们自个儿管理自个儿！”
    在他看来，什么“民主管理”，什么“生产竞赛”，都不过是“自找麻烦”。万助理员的这种思想和作风在新解放城市的旧技术人员中是相当普遍存在的。萧殷同志认为“这个人物也是不够现实的”。他说：“据一般情形，城市解放之后，工人就有诉苦运动，对于有坏作风的人员，一定受到群众的批评教育，即令他们在思想上还存留着旧的渣滓，但他们懂得共产党是反对欺压工人的，他们绝不敢做得这么露骨（像万国英那样）。即使旧思想偶而冒出来，欺压了工人，而工人们也绝不会认为他的欺压行为就是厂方的意志。”这里所举的理由是不充分的。一般的情形，城市解放之后，工人并没有诉苦运动。而旧人员的旧的作风也没有那样容易改变；他们习惯了那套旧的管理方法，那跟他们的整个思想和经验是分不开的。他们思想上存留着的“旧的渣滓”，岂只“偶而冒出”一下，而是在他们工作中经常起作用的因素。像万助理员那样官僚主义、命令主义的作风，不但在新解放城市的旧人员中，而且在老解放区的一部分共产党员的干部中，也是存在的。正如刘少奇同志在最近庆祝五一劳动节的讲话中谈到我们工作中的缺点、错误时所说的：“错误中最严重的是命令主义的错误。”我们在生产工作及其他一切工作中都必须反对我们干部中的命令主义的错误作风。蔡天心同志不从这个实际情况出发，倒认为万国英是“一个品质很好的同志”，好像他的那种命令主义的错误，不过是工作作风上的一点“缺点”，并不严重；好像我们今天在工作中所要反对的，主要并不是干部的命令主义的作风，而是人民群众的“落后”。这难道是正确的吗？
    《红旗歌》批评了万助理员的命令主义作风，表扬了彭管理员的民主作风，是完全需要的。自然，彭管理员还不是管理民主化的完满的体现者。但无论如何，他的作风是民主的，他对待自己的阶级兄弟，不是“吹胡子瞪眼”，而是带着满腔的热情与十分关切的态度。他关心他们的切身利益；他对他们的缺点错误耐心地进行说服教育，做到仁至义尽的地步。就是马芬姐也不能不讲他好：“你把我当人看待”，这是从心里说来的感激的话。
    要发动和组织生产竞赛，单靠个别管理人员的民主作风和耐心说服教育的方法，当然还是不够的。生产竞赛是一个广大工人群众的自觉的运动，是行政管理上一个巨大复杂的组织的工作。没有坚强的党的政治领导和工会的积极活动，没有党、工会和行政组织在工作上的良好的配合，竞赛是发动不起来的，即使发动起来也是不能坚持下去的。《红旗歌》的主要的也是比较严重的缺点就是没有很好地表现出工厂中党的领导和工会活动的作用。不错，彭管理员、老刘、金芳都是代表党的人物，但是看不见党的集体的领导，只看见彭管理员一人“单枪匹马”。党员的形象显得没有力量。具有光荣的斗争传统的上海工人，看了金芳这个人物，就觉得她太软弱了，不够他们所理想的共产党员的水平。他们的这个批评是很对的。工会的活动也太少，几乎完全成了行政的附庸。工会分会主任老刘的一个重要活动，就是送配卖面到马芬姐家中，并送还她的围腰、证章，通知她回厂，这一件事引起了正在绝望中的马芬姐思想上情感上激烈的变化，使她走上最后的转变。工会关心工人的物质福利，并在可能条件下改善工人生活，对于启发和提高工人的政治觉悟，巩固他们的劳动纪律，具有重大的意义。但是作为共产主义学校的工会，应当抓紧一切机会对工人进行阶级的政治的教育；作为工会分会主任的老刘却没有尽到这样的责任。他对马芬姐的错误没有进行过一次认真的批评。不但是他，就是彭管理员、金芳，在对待马芬姐的错误上，耐心说服是很够的，但有些地方却表现了过多的感情的迁就。就团结和教育的方法上的这种缺点来说，蔡天心同志的批评是对的。新社会的劳动纪律所以与旧社会的劳动纪律不同，就在：它是建立在广大工人自觉的基础上的；它首先是靠说服教育的方法建立与巩固起来的。但在工人自觉水平不齐的情况下，不能仅仅限于说服鼓励的方法，同时还要采取必要的强制手段来对付好吃懒做、破坏劳动纪律的分子，虽然马芬姐还不是这样的分子，她还不是真正存心破坏生产。
    在《红旗歌》中，工厂的正规的民主管理制度并没有建立起来，这种制度是必须通过工厂管理委员会和工人代表会议等等组织形式才能正式建立起来的。这个工厂不过在管理民主化上走了第一步。《红旗歌》中的竞赛也带着生产竞赛运动的初期的、甚至自发的形态。我们看到工人一经解放就立刻爆发出空前未有的劳动热情，这股热情是蓬蓬勃勃的，但还没有凝结起来，形成新的生产秩序与新的劳动纪律。《红旗歌》的许多场面给了人一个印象，好像在这竞赛中工人们并不在紧张生产，而只是在争执和吵架，这固然是为了展开剧中人物的思想斗争，并且因为正面表现生产过程受到舞台的限制，但同时也反映了这个工厂的生产领导还没有完全纳入正规。“红旗”竞赛也还只是单纯依靠工人的生产热情和提高劳动强度，而还没有转入到节省原料、减低成本、发明创造、改进技术的方面去。现在我们的工业生产，我们的生产竞赛是前进很远了！在东北，展开了群众性的新纪录运动。这个运动已由个人的新纪录发展到集体的新纪录，由单纯提高劳动强度的新纪录发展到改进技术操作、生产保安和发明创造的新纪录了。因为《红旗歌》中的竞赛还是初期的，在这竞赛中进步了、转变了的张大梅、马芬姐、万助理员，他们的进步和转变自然也还只是初步的，基础不稳固的，在他们面前还等待着有更多的考验。
    《红旗歌》正是反映了我们工业生产战线上的初期的情况和缺点。作者对于当时的情况自然也还是没有反映得完全，他更没有比现实看得更远。
    《红旗歌》没有足够地表现工厂中党的领导与工会活动的作用，但却过多地、不适当地描写了马芬姐的孤僻、顽强的性格，使工业生产上的严肃的思想斗争，在某些地方变成了大梅和芬姐两个不同性格的冲突，这形成了这个剧本的另一方面的缺点，削弱了这个剧本的教育的意义。马芬姐的转变，在第三幕是已经完成了的，但为要表现马芬姐的那种特出的性格，作者故布疑阵，使观众担心，不知她到底转变没有，而当看到她最后那么热情、那么激动地表白自己态度的时候，观众的心理就受到了更大的安慰和鼓动。这种戏剧的效果，就恰恰显示了艺术创作上有害的人为的痕迹。对马芬姐性格的某些过分的不适当的描写，萧殷同志的批评是正确的。
    我对于《红旗歌》的意见，大体上就是以上这些。有不对的地方，请大家指正。
