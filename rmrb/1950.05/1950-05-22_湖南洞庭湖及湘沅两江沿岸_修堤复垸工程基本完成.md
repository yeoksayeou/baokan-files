Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 19th: The embankment repair and polder restoration projects along Dongting Lake in Hunan Province, covering eleven counties including Changde, Yiyang, Yuanjiang, Huarong, Nanxian, Anxiang, Hanshou, Xiangyin, Fengxian, Yueyang, and Linxiang, as well as counties along the Xiang and Yuan Rivers such as Changsha and Xiangtan, have been basically completed. Since the full commencement of these projects in late February, a total of 31,433,390 cubic meters of earthwork has been completed (excluding over one million cubic meters of earthwork at Datong Lake), accounting for 99 percent of the planned total earthwork. This will protect four million mu of farmland from flooding, thereby increasing rice production by 150 million shi.

During the embankment repair process, the Hunan Provincial People's Government allocated 37 million jin of public grain and adopted the method of "public assistance based on people's contribution, work as a form of relief," effectively resolving the livelihood problems of 500,000 disaster victims for two months. However, due to the massive scale of the projects, the short timeframe, and the lack of responsibility among some individual cadres, the embankment repair work is generally rough, and some sections of the embankments have experienced collapses and slope failures. To this end, the Hunan Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau has instructed all localities to thoroughly inspect the repaired embankments and polders, promptly find ways to remedy the loopholes, and instructed all localities to immediately establish county and district flood control command organizations to strengthen flood control work. All localities are currently implementing these measures.

　　湖南洞庭湖及湘沅两江沿岸
    修堤复垸工程基本完成
    【新华社长沙十九日电】湖南洞庭湖沿岸之常德、益阳、沅江、华容、南县、安乡、汉寿、湘阴、沣县、岳阳、临湘等十一县及沿湘、沅两江的长沙、湘潭等县的修堤复垸工程业已基本完成。上述工程自二月下旬全部动工以来，现已完成土方三千一百四十三万三千三百九十公方（大通湖一百余万土方未计算在内），占预定总土方百分之九十九，可使四百万亩耕地免遭水灾，从而可增产稻谷一亿五千万石。
    在修堤过程中，湖南省人民政府曾拨发公粮三千七百万斤，采取“民筹公助、以工代赈”的办法，有效地解决了五十万灾民两个月的生活问题。但由于工程浩大、时间短促以及个别干部缺乏负责精神，修堤工程一般较为粗糙，个别堤段已发生塌陷和泻坡现象。为此，湖南省水利局已指示各地深入检查已修复的堤垸，及时设法补救漏洞，并指示各地立即成立县、区防汛指挥机构，加强防汛工作。现各地正具体贯彻执行中。
