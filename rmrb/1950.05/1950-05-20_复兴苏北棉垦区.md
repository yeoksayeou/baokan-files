Revitalizing the Subei Cotton Reclamation Area
萧颖 (Xiao Ying)

    The coastal area of ​​Subei, starting from the Yangtze River in the south and reaching Guanyun in the north, bounded by the Fan Gong Dike in the west, covers approximately 31 million mu of land. It is a young plain newly formed by the alluvial deposits of the Yellow and Huai Rivers. The soil contains alkali, and the climate is warm and humid, making it most suitable for cotton cultivation. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, farmers worked diligently to cultivate the land, with cotton fields distributed in Qidong, Haimen, Rugao, Nantong, Dongtai, Yancheng, Fudong and other counties reaching 6 million mu, producing more than 1.5 million dan of ginned cotton annually. This was the largest raw material supply base for the textile industries of Shanghai, Wuxi, Nantong and other cities, and one of China's major cotton-producing regions. The majority of the cotton planted was "Dai Zi Cotton" (岱字棉: medium maturity, fiber length 29 to 31 mm, capable of spinning yarn of 32 counts or higher) and "De Zi Cotton" (德字棉: many fruit branches, early maturity, suitable for growing in the Yangtze River basin. Fiber length 32 to 34 mm, capable of spinning yarn of 42 to 60 counts). The quality was extremely good, capable of spinning 32-count and 42-count fine yarn.

    After the War of Resistance, the area suffered from the occupation and plunder by the Japanese puppets and Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Sluice gates were destroyed, dikes were incomplete, and the water system was chaotic, losing its function of drainage and alkali washing, resulting in continuous floods. During the War of Liberation, the area was also blockaded and divided by the Chiang Kai-shek bandits, making it impossible to exchange cotton and grain at equal value, leading to a sharp decrease in cotton fields. According to last year's statistics, only 2.6 million mu remained, only one-third of the pre-war amount. The average yield per mu also decreased from 100 jin to 30 jin.

    After the complete liberation of Subei, the People's Government immediately paid attention to restoring cotton fields and expanding planting areas. On March 20th this year, the Subei Administrative Office issued a decision on developing the cotton reclamation area, bringing new hope to the cotton reclamation area. The plan to restore the pre-war production level in three years has already begun to be implemented.

    In order to block the flooding of the Yellow Sea tide, in the area of 182.3 kilometers from the mouth of the abandoned Yellow River to Jiaoxie, more than 100,000 migrant workers successively constructed new dikes and repaired the dilapidated old dikes since last winter. Under the leadership of the People's Government, the hardworking farmers used simple tools such as small carts, large shovels, iron spades, and carrying poles to launch a struggle against the sea tide. This new dike, together with the 160-kilometer old seawall from Jiaoxie to the banks of the Yangtze River, which is still in good condition, forms a 700-li-long Great Wall of flood prevention, so that the sea tide can only roar outside the dike from now on.

    Simultaneous with the seawall construction project, severely flooded rivers were also dredged and reorganized. On the second, third, fourth Mao You Rivers, Zhongzhi River, Zi Wu River, Sanhe River, Wangjiagang, Xinyang River and other nine main rivers, sluice gates were built and the water system was reorganized, so that the river drainage was smooth and would not cause floods. It can also lower the groundwater level, so that the alkaline content in the cotton fields will not rise too much, and fresh water in the river can be used to wash and irrigate the cotton fields. For the two projects of seawall construction and river management, the People's Government allocated a total of 50 million jin of grain and mobilized 250,000 migrant workers. It has now been basically completed, combining disaster relief and laying the foundation for the revitalization of the cotton reclamation area.

    In order to improve the quality of cotton and increase the yield per unit area, the area is systematically replacing varieties with improved seeds. 130,000 dan of improved seeds were loaned to cotton farmers by the government, and another 12,400 dan of pure "Dai Zi Cotton" seeds and 15,000 dan of pure "De Zi Cotton" seeds will grow in the 600,000 mu of land in the eight pure-seed breeding areas. Ten state-owned cotton farms specialize in conducting experiments to improve cotton planting techniques to guide cotton farmers, and a large number of pesticides have also been transported to the cotton area.

    The cotton farmers said to the comrades who lent the cotton seeds: "Now that you have come, there is hope for our lives." They are reclaiming barren cotton fields and carefully cultivating the old cotton fields. The whole area will increase the planting of cotton fields by 500,000 mu this year. The announcement by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government on ensuring the ratio of cotton and hemp to grain prices has greatly increased the enthusiasm of local farmers for planting cotton.

    Of the 31 million mu of cotton reclamation area, 13 million mu of land is suitable for cotton planting. The boundless fields can be cultivated by tractors. The Subei Dongxin Mechanical Farm has been established. The farm currently has three tractors, one seeder, and one harvester. Soon, 20 Soviet-style tractors will be transported to the farm for reclamation. Taipei County's private Yumin Workshop has invested in the reclamation of 1,500 mu.

　　复兴苏北棉垦区
　　萧颖
    苏北沿海地区，南起长江，北至灌云，西界范公堤，约有三千一百余万亩土地，是黄淮新冲积成的年青平原。土质含碱，气候温湿，最适宜植棉。抗日战争以前，农民辛勤垦殖，分布在启东、海门、如皋、南通、东台、盐城、阜东等县的棉田达六百万亩，年产皮棉一百五十余万担，为上海、无锡、南通各城市纺织工业最大的原料供给地和我国大棉产区之一。种植的大部为“岱字棉”（岱字棉：成熟期适中，纤维长度二十九到三十一公厘，可纺三十二支以上细纱。）及“德字棉”（德字棉：果枝多，成熟早，适于长江流域生长。纤维长三十二到三十四公厘，可纺四十二支到六十支细纱。）质量极好，可纺三十二支纱及四十二支的细纱。
    抗战以后，历经日伪、蒋匪盘据掠夺，涵闸破坏，堤防残缺，水系混乱，失去排水洗碱的作用，造成连年水灾。解放战争中，又遭蒋匪封锁分割，使棉粮不能等价交换，致使棉田急骤减少。据去年统计，尚余二百六十余万亩，仅及战前三分之一。每亩平均产量也从一百斤降低到三十斤。

    苏北全部解放后，人民政府即注意恢复棉田，扩大种植面积。今年三月二十日，苏北行政公署发布了开发棉垦区的决定，给棉垦区带来了新的希望。三年恢复战前生产水平的计划，已在开始实施了。
    为挡住黄海潮的泛滥，从废黄河口至角斜间一百八十二又十分之三公里的地区，从去冬就先后有十余万民工修筑新堤，培补破败不堪的旧堤。勤劳的农民们，在人民政府领导下，用小车、大锹、铁锨、扁担等简陋的工具，展开了与海潮的斗争。这条新堤与角斜至长江岸边一百六十公里尚称完好的旧海堤连成一体，形成长七百华里的防水长城，从此海潮只能在堤外咆哮了。
    与修海堤工程的同时，也疏浚整理了水灾严重的河流。在第二、第三、第四卯酉河、中直河、子午河、三合河、王家港、新洋河等九条干河上，修建了涵闸，整理了水系，使河流排水通畅，不至酿成水灾，又可使地下水位下降，使棉田内碱质不至过多升起，并可放河内淡水洗灌棉田。修筑海堤与治河两项工程，人民政府共拨粮五千万斤动员民工二十五万，目前已基本完成，结合了救灾，打下了复兴棉垦区的基础。
    为提高棉花质量，增加单位面积的产量，该区正在有计划的改换良种。十三万担良种由政府贷给了棉农，还有一万二千四百担纯“岱字棉”种和一万五千担纯“德字棉”种将在八个纯种繁殖区的六十万亩土地上生长起来。十个公营棉场专门作试验，提高植棉技术来指导棉农，大量的杀虫药剂也运到了棉区。
    棉农们向贷放棉种的工作同志们说：“你们来了，我们的日子就有了希望。”他们开垦荒了的棉田，精耕着旧有的棉田，全区今年将增植棉田五十万亩，中央人民政府政务院财经委员会保证棉、麻与粮食比价的通告，更大大的增加了当地农民们植棉的热情。

    三千一百余万亩的棉垦区，有一千三百余万亩的土地是适宜于植棉的。一望无际的原野，可用拖拉机耕种，苏北东辛机械农场已经成立，该场现有三部拖拉机，播种机及收割机各一部，不久将有二十部苏联式拖拉机运往该场垦荒。台北县私营裕民工场已投资兴垦了一千五百亩。
