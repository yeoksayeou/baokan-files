    Resolving Difficulties for Farmers in Guannei Before Wheat Harvest
    Massive Exchange of Coarse Grains from Northeast for Wheat
    Ministry of Trade Determines Exchange Quantities and Methods

    [Reported by our correspondent Kang Weizhong] This year, Guannei has sufficient rainfall, and a good wheat harvest is expected. The masses in wheat-producing areas are requesting government purchase. In order to help disaster-stricken people in Guannei overcome the current severe difficulties during the pre-harvest period, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government has decided to have the Ministry of Trade exchange the massive surplus of coarse grains from the Northeast for wheat from Guannei. The Ministry of Trade will then compensate the Northeast with cotton cloth and other industrial products. This will both allow for the purchase of some surplus wheat from farmers in Guannei, resolve the need for coarse grains in disaster areas, and prevent a sharp drop in wheat prices. It will also find a market for surplus grain in the Northeast, and allow light industrial products from Guannei to be sold in the Northeast. Based on this decision, the Ministry of Trade convened a meeting of the directors of the commercial departments, managers of grain companies, and directors of cooperatives from Hebei, Shandong, Pingyuan, and Henan provinces, as well as the northern Anhui region, to discuss the matter. The Ministry of Trade has now determined the specific amounts of coarse grains to be allocated to each province: Hebei Province, 145 million jin (including 15 million jin of bean cake); Pingyuan Province, 50 million jin (including 10 million jin of bean cake); Shandong Province, 62 million jin (including 12 million jin of bean cake); Henan, 50 million jin; northern Anhui, 80 million jin. The total is 387 million jin, which will be used to exchange for wheat. As for the standards and quality of coarse and fine grains, it has been determined that the standard will be medium or above local grains. The moisture content of coarse grains shall not exceed 14 percent, and red sorghum and millet shall not exceed 13 percent. The impurity content: corn shall not exceed 1 percent, red sorghum shall not exceed 1.5 percent, millet shall not exceed 2 percent, and soybeans shall not exceed 1 percent. The moisture content of wheat in Guannei (spring wheat will not be accepted) shall not exceed 13 percent. The impurity content shall not exceed 1 percent in Hebei, Pingyuan, and Shandong provinces, 1.5 percent in Henan, and 3 percent in northern Anhui.

    The exchange ratio of coarse and fine grains has also been determined based on the quality of coarse grains from the Northeast and wheat from various provinces in Guannei, and a reasonable exchange rate has been set. The details are as follows: (1) Exchange rate for the masses: In Hebei, Pingyuan, Henan, and Shandong provinces, each jin of wheat can be exchanged for no more than 1.5 liang of Northeast corn, 1.6 liang of red sorghum, 1.10 liang of millet, and 1.4 liang of soybeans. In northern Anhui, each jin of wheat can be exchanged for 1.45 liang of Northeast corn and 1.55 liang of red sorghum (the exchange ratio of wheat for both previously stored and newly transported Northeast grain is the same). For local grain in each province, each jin of wheat can be exchanged for no more than 1.3 liang of corn, 1.6 liang of red sorghum, and 1.1 liang of millet. (2) Requirements of the Ministry of Trade for each province: In Hebei, Henan, Pingyuan, and Shandong provinces (including all expenses, handling fees, taxes, and losses for lending coarse grains and recovering wheat), every 100 jin of wheat shall be exchanged for 160 jin of Northeast corn, 170 jin of red sorghum, 150 jin of soybeans, and 190 jin of millet. In northern Anhui, 5 jin shall be added to each of the above coarse grain ratios.

    Regarding the transportation and handover of coarse and fine grains:
    (1) The Northeast is responsible for escorting the Northeast grain and ensuring the quality of the grain (moisture and impurities do not exceed the prescribed standards). The Northeast is responsible for any spoilage during transportation. The North China Grain Company is responsible for resolving 1 million hemp bags for packaging grain, and the Northeast is responsible for resolving 500,000 bags. (2) In areas with cooperatives, the grain company and the cooperative shall sign a contract under the leadership of the local financial committee, and the cooperative shall act as an agent for the coarse-to-fine grain exchange.

    In order to ensure that the distribution of coarse and fine grains is not delayed, it is stipulated that the distribution of coarse grains must be completed by the end of June, and the exchange of coarse grains for wheat must be completed no later than the end of October.

　　解决麦收前关内农民困难
    东北巨额粗粮交换小麦
    贸易部确定交换数量及办法
    【本报讯】本报记者康伟中报道：关内今年雨水充足，小麦可望丰收，产麦地区群众要求政府收购；中央人民政府亦为了帮助关内灾民渡过当前青黄不接的严重困难，由政务院财政经济委员会决定，将东北巨额剩余粗粮交贸易部换购关内小麦，并由贸易部以纱布及其他工业品偿付东北。这样既可以收购部分关内农民余麦，解决灾区农民对粗粮的需要，防止麦价暴跌；又可以为东北余粮找到销路，而使关内轻工业产品行销东北。贸易部本此决定，召集了河北、山东、平原、河南四省及皖北区商业厅长、粮食公司经理及合作社主任开会讨论。现贸易部已确定东北粗粮分配与各省的具体数目：计河北省一万四千五百万斤（包括豆饼一千五百万斤）；平原省五千万斤（包括豆饼一千万斤）；山东省六千二百万斤（包括豆饼一千二百万斤）；河南五千万斤；皖北八千万斤。以上共计三八、七○○万斤，用以换购小麦。至于粗细粮的标准及质量方面，亦确定一律以当地中等以上的粮食为标准。粗粮所含水分不超过百分之十四，红粮、谷子不超过百分之十三；所含杂质：玉米不超过百分之一，红粮不超过百分之一点五，谷子不超过百分之二，大豆不超过百分之一。关内小麦（春麦不收）所含水分不得超过百分之十三。所含杂质规定：河北、平原、山东三省不超过百分之一，河南不超过百分之一点五，皖北不超过百分之三。
    对粗细粮的交换比率，亦根据了东北粗粮与关内各省麦子的质量，规定了合理的交换率。计（一）对群众交换比率：河北、平原、河南及山东四省，按每斤小麦换东北玉米不超过一斤五两，红粮一斤六两，谷子一斤十两，大豆一斤四两；皖北每斤小麦换东北玉米一斤四两五，红粮一斤五两五（原存之东北粮与新运到的东北粮之交换小麦比率同）。各省之本地粮，每斤小麦交换比率为玉米不超过一斤三两，红粮一斤六两，小米一斤。（二）贸易部对各省要求：河北、河南、平原、山东四省（包括粗粮贷出与小麦收回一切费用、手续费、税款及损耗），每百斤小麦换东北玉米一百六十斤，红粮一百七十斤，大豆一百五十斤，谷子一百九十斤；皖北则照上述粗粮比率，各增五斤。
    关于粗细粮食的运输与交接问题：
    （一）东北粮由东北负责押运，并保证粮食的质量（水分及杂质不超过规定标准）。中途车上如发生霉坏由东北负责。包装粮食的麻袋由华北粮食公司负责解决一百万条，东北解决五十万条。（二）在有合作社的地区，在该地财委主持下由粮食公司与合作社签订合同，由合作社代理以粗换细工作。
    为了粗细粮发运不误时机，规定粗粮发放不得超过六月底，收粗粮换小麦最迟不得超过十月底。
