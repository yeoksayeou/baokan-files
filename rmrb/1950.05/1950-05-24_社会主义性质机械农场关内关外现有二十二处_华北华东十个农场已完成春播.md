Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd:

　　The spring planting work of ten state-owned mechanized farms in North and East China was mostly completed in mid-May. The ten farms have a total of 189,400 mu of land, with 139,000 mu actually planted. A total of 139 tractors were used, completing spring planting of 21,000 mu of cotton, 9,500 mu of hemp, and 20,800 mu of coarse grains. In addition, the transplanting of 19,588 mu of rice paddies will be fully completed before May 26.

　　The ten state-owned mechanized farms include eight in North China and two in East China. Those in North China are: Gaoli Farm (near Tianjin) and Huanghua (formerly Xinhai County Farm) under the Bohai Agricultural Reclamation Bureau, Jingjiao Farm in the suburbs of Beijing, Jiheng Farm (in Hengshui County), Yongnian Farm, and Baoding Farm in Hebei Province, Bo'ai Farm in Pingyuan Province, and Chabei Farm in Chahar Province. Those in East China are: Guangbei Farm in Shandong Province and Dongxin Farm in Jiangsu Province.

　　Gaoli Farm is a key demonstration farm among the mechanized farms in North China, with 52,292 mu of land, 24 tractors (734 horsepower), 7 electric water pumps (1,250 horsepower), and 249 employees. The farm mainly grows rice and cotton. Spring plowing began in mid-March and was completed by early May, with 4,953 mu of cotton planted. Transplanting of over 17,000 mu of rice paddies is underway. The farm also plans to plant a large amount of alfalfa and green manure crops this autumn.

　　All state-owned mechanized farms have paid attention to learning from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in management and cultivation methods. Gaoli Farm has adopted a six-year rotation system mainly based on rice and cotton; and learned from the Soviet experience to implement close planting of rice and cotton (rice spacing is 0.85 feet in both rows and columns, cotton row spacing is 2.15 feet, and plant spacing is 1 foot) and to trial dry seeding of rice (i.e., irrigating only after sowing and emergence).

　　During spring plowing and sowing, the employees of each farm demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm and creativity. For example, in order to complete spring plowing and sowing on schedule despite the shortage of machinery, the employees of Gaoli Farm implemented shift rotation, working day and night. Bo'ai Farm did not have a cotton planter, so they came up with the idea of modifying and applying the original wheat drill, with good results. All farms lacked repair equipment, but they overcame this difficulty, gradually established small repair shops, and completed machine repairs in a timely manner, reducing downtime.

　　In addition to the ten state-owned mechanized farms inside the customs, there are twelve in Northeast China. These farms are China's first batch of socialist mechanized farms. The progress of these farms is a matter of concern to the people of the whole country. These farms currently lack complete management experience; lack cadres and skilled technicians; machines cannot be manufactured independently; and equipment such as oil depots and repair shops are extremely rudimentary. Therefore, the current management policy of state-owned mechanized farms is to focus on gaining experience and training cadres. In order to train cadres, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has established an agricultural machinery school, which has already trained 455 tractor drivers this spring. In order to supply the existing farms with the necessary machinery, the Ministry has recently established a state-owned farm supply station and a machinery and agricultural implement repair and assembly plant in the suburbs of Beijing.

### 社会主义性质机械农场关内关外现有二十二处  华北华东十个农场已完成春播

　　社会主义性质机械农场关内关外现有二十二处
    华北华东十个农场已完成春播
    【新华社二十二日讯】华北和华东的十个国营机械农场，春播工作在五月中旬已大部完成。十个农场共有土地十八万九千四百亩，实际种植者为十三万九千亩，共出动拖拉机一百三十九台，已完成了春播的计有棉二万一千亩，麻九千五百亩，杂粮二万零八百亩。另水稻一万九千五百八十八亩的插秧工作，五月二十六日前即可全部完成。
    十个国营机械农场计华北八个，华东两个。在华北的为：渤海区农垦管理局所属的高里农场（天津附近）和黄骅（原新海县农场，北京郊区的京郊农场，河北省的冀衡农场（在衡水县）、永年农场和保定农场，平原省的博爱农场，察哈尔省的察北农场。在华东的为：山东省的广北农场和江苏省的东辛农场。
    高里农场是华北机械农场中的重点示范场，有地五万二千二百九十二亩，拖拉机二十四台（七百三十四马力），电力抽水机七台（一千二百五十马力），职工二百四十九人。该场以种植稻、棉为主，春耕于三月中旬开始，至五月上旬即已完成，植棉四千九百五十三亩亦已完成，水稻一万七千余亩正在插秧。该场并拟于今秋大量种植苜蓿和绿肥作物。
    各国营机械农场在经营管理和耕作方法等方面，都注意了学习苏联的先进经验。高里农场已采用以水稻、棉花为主的六年轮栽制；并学习苏联经验，实行水稻、棉花密植（水稻株行距离均为零点八五英尺，棉花行距为二点一五英尺，株距一英尺）和试行水稻旱播法（即在播种出苗后才灌水）。
    春耕播种中，各场职工都表现了高度的劳动热忱和创造智慧，如高里农场职工在机械不足的状况下为按期完成春耕春播，实行分班轮换，昼夜不停地耕作。博爱农场没有棉花播种机，他们就想法把原有的小麦条播机改装应用，结果良好。各场都缺乏修理设备，但都克服了这个困难，逐渐设立了小修理间，及时完成了机器的修理，减少了停耕时间。
    我国的国营的机械农场除关内的十个外，东北还有十二个。这些农场是我国第一批的社会主义性质的机械化农场。这些农场工作的进展情况受到全国人民的关怀。这些农场目前还缺乏成套的经营管理经验；还缺乏干部和熟练的技工；机器不能自造；油库、修理厂等设备均极简陋。因此，目前国营机械农场的经营方针，是以吸取经验和培养干部为主。为着培养干部，中央人民政府农业部已创办了一个农业机械学校，今春即已训练出拖拉机驾驶员四百五十五人。为着供应现有各农场以必需的机械，该部近又在北京郊区设立了一个国营农场物资供应站和一个机械农具修配厂。
