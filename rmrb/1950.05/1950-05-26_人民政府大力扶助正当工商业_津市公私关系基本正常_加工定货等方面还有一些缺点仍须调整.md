Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 25th – Since the liberation of Tianjin over a year ago, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government has implemented a policy of benefiting both public and private sectors and developing production, vigorously supporting private industry and commerce beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood. Public-private relations are basically normal; however, there are still some shortcomings that need to be adjusted.

Over the past year, the various public trading departments and the Tianjin branch of the People's Bank of China, among others, have helped restore and develop legitimate private industry and commerce through various means.

Methods of Supporting Industry and Commerce Over the Past Year

Government agencies and public trading departments have helped solve the difficulties faced by many private factories in terms of supply, production, and sales through the method of commissioned processing, enabling these factories to rapidly restore and develop production. To date, most of the private textile, flour, dyeing, egg production, and milling industries in the city have been able to maintain production because of processing for state-owned companies. For example, 90 percent of the private flour mills' production capacity in the city has been used for state processing over the past year.

Government transportation departments and military agencies have solved the production difficulties of many private factories through order placements and have enabled these factories to develop to a certain extent. For example, most rubber factories in Tianjin have earned considerable profits last year due to large orders from the military, government agencies, and the Tianjin Trust Company. The business of some machine factories has also flourished due to large orders from government agencies.

The North China Department Store and the Tianjin Trust Company, among others, have solved the problem of sluggish sales of products from many private factories through "acquisition." Currently, the Tianjin Department Store purchases goods from 200 factories, of which private factories account for 95 percent. From April 1st to May 10th this year, within forty days, the company acquired a total of over 34 billion yuan worth of products from public and private factories, of which private factories accounted for about 80 percent. This year, the Tianjin Trust Company acquired approximately 80 percent of the total production of various private electrical equipment factories.

Various public trading companies have solved the sales problems of some private factories' products through consignment sales, enabling these factories to carry out production in a more planned manner. For example, the state-owned Coal Industry Building Materials Company and the North China Department Store have signed consignment sales contracts with the Kailuan Coal Mine and the Qixin Cement Company. The Qixin Cement Company has gained many profits from the consignment sales of its products by public companies.

The Tianjin branch of the People's Bank of China has issued order placement loans and mortgage loans to help solve the capital turnover and various operational difficulties of many private manufacturers that are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood. In the past year, the branch lent a total of more than 96.5 billion yuan to private enterprises, accounting for 46.9 percent of the total industrial and commercial loans for the year. By implementing entrepot mortgage and "packaging," "foreign currency" and other export loans, the bank not only developed export trade but also enabled many private exporters to obtain legitimate profits. For example, after receiving loan assistance, the total business volume of Xinglong Foreign Firm increased from 40,000 to 50,000 US dollars in January to more than 230,000 US dollars in April.

In addition, government agencies and public companies have also provided various conveniences to private industry and commerce in terms of purchasing raw materials, transportation, supplying foreign exchange, and taxation. Especially since most manufacturers have encountered temporary difficulties in operation this year, the People's Government and the trade union have worked harder to assist manufacturers and called on all employees to produce and save, reduce the excessively high treatment under the current circumstances, and overcome difficulties together with the capitalists. These measures have increased the operating confidence of most capitalists, enabling them to continue to maintain production and strive for improvement.

Shortcomings and Problems Existing in Public-Private Economic Relations

However, in Tianjin's public-private relations, there have been and still exist some shortcomings and problems.

In terms of processing: Sometimes the conditions for commissioned processing by public enterprises are too harsh. Coupled with some unreasonable phenomena in the production management of private factories themselves, the production cost is relatively increased, and the processing profit is reduced, or even unprofitable. On the other hand, some private factories also have phenomena of cutting corners and shoddy manufacturing in processing, and individual factories even use processing raw materials for reselling speculation and other illegal activities.

In terms of order placement: Some state agencies or enterprises sometimes do not take sufficient or comprehensive care of private manufacturers in the allocation of orders. For example, the Water Conservancy Promotion Society of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government ordered a large number of waterwheels from four private factories in Tianjin, while dozens of other metal smelting factories had no work to do. On the other hand, some private factories cannot deliver orders on time.

In terms of acquisition and consignment sales: Individual state-owned companies sometimes acquire slow-selling goods at low prices without taking into account the cost of private factories. On the other hand, some private manufacturers try to earn high profits and sometimes offer excessively high prices. Some private manufacturers refuse to sell at bargained prices when prices rise, but complain that the public sector buys too little when prices fall, and even sell bad goods to the public sector first.

In terms of loans, the People's Bank lacks an overall plan, and the loan procedures are cumbersome, the loan term is short, and it is not timely enough, and sometimes the interest rate is too high. Most private manufacturers also have the idea of simply relying on loans and do not actively try to expand their capital. In the use of loans, some are used to repay debts or to add equipment that is not needed for current production. Individual manufacturers even use loans for speculative trading, which undermines the country's financial policy.

In terms of raw material procurement and sales markets, the lack of a clear division of labor and cooperation between the public and private sectors has caused many private manufacturers to encounter many difficulties when going to the countryside to purchase and sell goods.

In terms of taxation: Tianjin's taxation work has made great achievements, and tax procedures have also been improved in the past year; however, the procedures are still very cumbersome. There are also individual cases of excessively high valuations during tax assessment. On the other hand, many private manufacturers have serious tax evasion.

The Tianjin Municipal People's Government and relevant state economic organs are actively solving the above problems. For example, problems such as excessively high processing conditions and excessively low individual purchase prices have generally been appropriately adjusted. Regarding the allocation of large orders, the specific conditions for signing contracts, export prices, and simplification of tax procedures, the Municipal Finance Committee, relevant departments, and private industrialists and businessmen are conducting consultations separately or organizing special committees to formulate implementation plans. As for formulating a comprehensive loan plan, the division of labor and cooperation between public and private enterprises in the procurement of raw materials and the sales market of finished products, and the erroneous thoughts and erroneous behaviors existing in some private manufacturers, still need to be further studied and resolved.

　　人民政府大力扶助正当工商业
    津市公私关系基本正常
    加工定货等方面还有一些缺点仍须调整
    【新华社天津二十五日电】天津市人民政府自该市解放后一年余以来执行了公私兼顾、发展生产的政策，大力扶助有利于国计民生的私营工商业；公私关系基本上是正常的；但还有一些缺点须要加以调整。
    天津市各公营贸易部门及人民银行天津分行等一年多以来，通过各种方式，帮助正当的私营工商业的恢复与发展。
    一年来扶助工商业方式
    人民政府各机关及公营贸易部门等，曾以委托加工的方法，帮助解决了许多私营工厂在供、产、销方面的困难；使各该工厂生产得以迅速恢复与发展。截至目前，本市私营纺织、面粉、织染、制蛋、磨坊等工业中的大部分工厂，都因为为国营公司加工而得以维持生产。其中全市私营面粉厂百分之九十的生产力，一年来被使用于为国家加工。
    政府交通部门及部队机关等，通过定货解决了许多私营工厂的生产困难，并使这些工厂得到一定程度的发展。如津市绝大部分橡胶厂，因部队、机关及津市信托公司等的大批定货，去年都获得相当大的利润。部分机器厂的营业，也因政府机关大批定货而有了发达。
    华北区百货公司及天津市信托公司等，通过“收购”方式，解决了许多私营工厂产品滞销的困难。目前津市百货公司向二百家工厂购货，其中私营工厂占百分之九十五。仅今年四月一日到五月十日四十天内，该公司收购公私营工厂产品共三百四十余亿元，其中私营约占百分之八十。津市信托公司今年收购各私营电工器材厂的产品，约占各厂总生产量的百分之八十。
    各公营贸易公司等，以代销的方法解决了部分私营工厂的产品销路问题，并使各该工厂得以比较有计划地进行生产。如国营煤业建筑器材公司、华北区百货公司等，曾与开滦煤矿及启新洋灰公司等订立代销合同。启新洋灰公司由于公营公司代销产品，已获得很多利润。
    人民银行天津分行，曾发放定货贷款和抵押贷款等帮助解决许多有利于国计民生的私营厂商的资金周转及生产经营中的各种困难。去年一年间，该分行贷给私营企业的资金，共达九百六十五亿多，占全年工商业放款总额的百分之四十六点九。由于实行埠际押汇及“打包”、“外币”等出口贷款，该行不但使出口贸易得到了发展，并且使许多私营出口商获得了正当的利润。例如兴隆洋行获得贷款帮助后其营业总额由本年一月间的四、五万美元，增加到四月份的二十三万多美元。
    此外，政府机关及公营公司在采购原料、交通运输、供给外汇及税收等方面，也给予私营工商业种种方便。特别自今年一般厂商在经营中遇到暂时困难以来，人民政府与工会更努力协助厂商，并号召全体职工生产节约，减低在目前情况下过高的待遇，和资方共同克服困难。这些措施，都使一般资本家增加了经营信心，继续维持生产，力争好转。
    在公私经济关系中存在的缺点和问题
    但在津市公私关系中，过去曾有过、现在也存在着一些缺点和问题。
    在加工方面：有时公营企业委托加工条件过苛，加以私厂本身在生产管理上存在某些不合理的现象，因而相对地增加了生产成本，减少了加工利润，甚至无利可图。而另一方面，有些私营工厂在加工中，也有偷工减料、粗制滥造的现象，个别工厂甚至利用加工原料，进行捣卖投机等非法活动。
    在定货方面：某些国家机关或企业单位在分配定货上，有时对私营厂商照顾不足或不够全面。如中央人民政府农业部水利推进社，向天津四家私厂定制大批水车，而另外数十家五金冶制厂却无工可做。另一方面，有些私营工厂不能按期交付定货。
    在收购及代销方面：个别国营公司有时压价收购滞销的货物，没有照顾私厂成本。另一方面，有些私营厂商企图赚得高额利润，有时开价过高。有些私营厂商在物价上涨时勒价不卖，物价下落时则抱怨公家收购太少，甚至先把坏货卖给公家。
    在贷款方面，人民银行缺乏全面计划，且贷款手续繁琐，贷款期限较短，不够及时，有时利息过高。大部分私营厂商也有单纯依赖贷款的思想，自己不积极设法扩充资金。在贷款使用上，有的用于偿还债务，或用于增添当前生产不需要的设备上。个别厂商且有利用贷款，进行投机买卖，破坏了国家的金融政策。
    在采购原料与销售市场方面，由于公私间缺乏明确的分工和配合，曾使许多私营厂商下乡购销时遭受许多困难。
    在税收方面：天津市税收工作成绩是很大的，过去一年来税收手续也有改进；但目前手续依然很繁琐。在收税估价时，也有个别过高的情形。另一方面，许多私营厂商则存在着严重的偷税现象。
    天津市人民政府及有关国家经济机关对于以上问题现正积极进行解决中。如部分加工条件过高，个别收购价格偏低等问题，一般都得到了适当调整。关于大批定货的分配、签订合同的具体条件、出口价格及简化税收手续等，正由市财委会、有关部门、私营工商业者等，分别进行磋商，或组织专门委员会拟订实施方案中。至于拟订照顾全面的贷款计划、公私营企业间在原料采购和成品销售市场的分工和合作、以及某些私营厂商存在着的错误思想和错误行为等问题，则仍有待继续研究解决。
