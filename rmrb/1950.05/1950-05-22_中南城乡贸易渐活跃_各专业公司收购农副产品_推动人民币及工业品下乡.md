Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 20th. Urban-rural trade in the Central South region is becoming increasingly active. State-owned specialized companies are promoting the circulation of RMB and industrial goods to the countryside by appropriately purchasing agricultural and rural sideline products, thereby invigorating the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and supporting industrial and agricultural production.

    A new situation has emerged since mid-March, when prices began to fall: a large number of frozen materials from the inflation period have poured out, competing to be sold off, resulting in a surplus of goods in the markets of large cities and small towns along transportation lines, with the phenomenon of goods being available but no one buying them. However, the vast rural market is still controlled by silver dollars, the state-owned trading institutions are not yet sound, and the price decline is slower than in large cities. Farmers are unable to sell their local products and sideline products, and consequently, they cannot exchange them for necessary means of production and living. This disconnect greatly affects industrial and agricultural production and increases the difficulties of urban industry and commerce.

    In light of this situation, state-owned specialized companies in the Central South region have been appropriately purchasing various agricultural and rural sideline products since mid-April, organizing the circulation of RMB and industrial goods to the countryside. As of the 12th of this month, the Central South Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company had purchased more than 59,700 dan of cotton through its branches and purchasing stations in various regions. From the 1st to the 13th of this month, the Central South Oil and Fat Company purchased more than 21,000 dan of tung oil, 2,287 dan of rapeseed oil, and more than 600 shi of sesame oil. Recently, after the formal establishment of the Central South Native Produce Company's branches in various regions, a large amount of funds has also been allocated to commence the purchase of various native products, mountain goods, and handicraft products. In addition, the Central South Bristle Company and Egg Products Company have also strengthened their purchasing work. To cooperate with the purchasing efforts, state-owned department stores, state-owned salt companies, grain companies, etc., have organized the circulation of daily necessities to the countryside in large quantities through dispatching trade teams and carrying out retail and consignment sales. The Central South Tea Company, in conjunction with the purchase of tea, has also brought a large number of industrial goods and grain to supply to farmers.

    This measure has begun to achieve great results. The Changsha Salt Branch of the State-owned Salt Company has exceeded its original salt sales target by 38% in April due to the opening up of the rural market. Through the purchase of cotton, the Central South Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company raised the price ratio of cotton to rice from 1:5 to a reasonable ratio of 1:8, which helped cotton farmers and supplied the Wuhan No. 1 Cotton Mill with the raw cotton it needed. As a result of the active urban and rural markets, the sales volume of yarn increased from 1,470 pieces for the entire month of April to as many as 6,300 pieces in the first twelve days of May.

### 中南城乡贸易渐活跃  各专业公司收购农副产品  推动人民币及工业品下乡

　　中南城乡贸易渐活跃
    各专业公司收购农副产品     
    推动人民币及工业品下乡
    【新华社汉口二十日电】中南区各国营专业公司正通过适当收购农产品及农村副产品，推动人民币及工业品下乡，活跃城乡物资交流，扶植工农业生产。
    各地自三月中旬物价开始下跌以来出现的新情况是：通货膨胀期间各种冻结的物资大量涌出，竞相抛售，造成大城市及沿交通线中小城镇的市场商品过剩，有货无人买的现象；而广大农村市场仍为银元所控制，国营贸易机构尚未健全，物价跌落比大城市缓慢，农民的各种土产品及副产品都销不出去，必需的生产资料及生活资料也因之换不进来。这种脱节现象，大大影响了工农业生产，增加了城市工商业的困难。
    中南区各国营专业公司根据此种情况，自四月中旬以后，即适当收购各种农产品及农村副产品，组织人民币和工业品下乡。中南花纱布公司，截至本月十二日止，通过各地分支机构及收购栈，购进棉花达五万九千七百余担。中南油脂公司自本月一日至十三日止，收购桐油二万一千余担，菜油二千二百八十七担，麻油六百余石。最近中南土产公司各地分支机构正式建立后，亦调拨大批资金，着手收购各项土产、山货、手工业产品。此外，中南猪鬃公司、蛋品公司亦加强收购工作。为配合收购，各地国营百货公司、国营盐业公司、粮食公司等，通过派遣贸易小组及开展零售、代销业务，大量组织了日用品下乡。中南茶叶公司，结合收购茶叶，亦携带了大批工业品和粮食，供应农民。
    这一措施现已开始获得很大效果。国营长沙盐业分公司因开辟了农村市场，四月份盐的推销额超过原定销盐任务的百分之三十八。中南花纱布公司通过收购棉花，把棉花与大米的比价从一与五提高到一与八的合理比价，扶助了棉农，并供应了武汉第一纱厂的原棉需要。城乡市场活跃的结果，纱的销售量从四月份全月的一千四百七十件，增加到五月份上半月十二天内的六千三百件之多。
