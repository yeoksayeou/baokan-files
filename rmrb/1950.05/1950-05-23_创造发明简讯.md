　　Jiang Zhenyuan, from the Bozhen Maintenance District of the Tianjin Railway Administration, modified a curved rail straightening machine into a direct pressure machine, increasing work efficiency by nine times compared to the past and without damaging the quality of the steel rails. If calculated based on ten months of annual track maintenance, the maintenance district can save 2,700 workdays per year. Using eight catties of rice per workday as a calculation, this would save 21,600 catties of wages. The Tianjin Railway Bureau has transported the machine to Tianjin, and after further trials, plans to manufacture and promote it on a large scale. Jiang Zhenyuan is currently researching the manufacturing of movable switches, and if successful, it will solve the difficulty of the lack of switches on the railway.

　　Li Zhen, a worker in the power supply room of the Beijing Telecommunications Section of the Tianjin Railway Bureau, successfully modified a reverse current interrupter, overcoming the wasteful phenomena of easily generating residual or reverse currents in the past, which would damage components. He used the principle of gravity, modifying the reed from a vertical shape to a horizontally placed joint, and adding a red light and alarm bell. After the current passes through, the red light illuminates when each component is unobstructed, and the alarm bell rings urgently when an obstacle occurs, which can promptly remind the supervisor to repair it.

　　创造发明简讯
    天津铁路管理局泊镇领工区姜振元改造弯轨矫正机为直压力机，较前提高工作效率九倍，且不损坏钢轨质量。如以每年养路十个月计算，该领工区每年可省工二七○○个，以每工八斤米计，可省工资二万一千六百斤。天津路局已将该机运津，经进一步试用后，拟大量制造推广。姜振元现正研究制造活动道岔，如能成功，则可解决铁路上道岔缺乏的困难。

    天津铁路局北京电务段电源室工友李震，改造逆流遮断器成功，克服了过去容易产生剩余残流或逆流，以致损伤机件等浪费现象。他利用地心吸力的原理，把簧片由立形改造为平放的接头，添装红灯和警铃，电流通过后，各机件无障碍时即显示红灯，发生障碍时则警铃急响，可及时的提醒看管人修理。
