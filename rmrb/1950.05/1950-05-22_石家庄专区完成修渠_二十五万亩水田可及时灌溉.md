　　Shijiazhuang Special District Completes Canal Repair
    Twenty-Five Thousand Mu of Paddy Fields Can Be Irrigated in Time
    [Our Shijiazhuang Dispatch] The Shijiazhuang Special District, Hebei Province, has completed the repair of canals, enabling the timely irrigation of more than 250,000 mu of paddy fields. Thanks to the sufficient preparations made last winter and the strong leadership and grain loan assistance from governments at all levels this spring, the district successfully completed nine major canals irrigating over 10,000 mu each, sixteen major canals irrigating over 1,000 mu each, and over one hundred smaller canals, completing the major overhaul of spring projects. Water was released into the canals successively in early April.
    In canal repairs, the general approach is for households benefiting from the canals to bear the responsibility for cleaning and repairing them. For canals involving difficult projects and large expenditures, the government provides grain loan assistance to ensure their completion according to plan. Because canal repairs are directly related to the production interests of the masses, they have shown great enthusiasm in initiating construction. For example, the Jiabi Tan irrigation project in Pingshan, which irrigates 2,213 mu of land, newly built two flood prevention dikes, repaired one dike, used 2,775 cubic meters of stone, and dug 30 zhang of stone canal, using 210,000 jin of lime. Through the active efforts of the masses, it was completed in twenty days, and water began to be released to irrigate wheat on April 7. Larger canals in the district, such as the Lingzheng, Ji San, Yongsheng, and Datong canals, required changing lines, changing outlets, or building revetments due to scouring and submersion of the canal mouths. Due to insufficient manpower and poor engineering technology among the masses, they were repeatedly damaged and repaired without achieving a more permanent and solid structure. Last winter and this spring, the Hebei Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Engineering Team helped with surveying and planning and provided on-site guidance. The government also provided millet loans, which greatly boosted the morale of the masses. The Ji San, Lingzheng, and Yongsheng canals were all completed ahead of schedule or on time. Only the Datong Canal was not completed because the intake gate, 200 meters of revetment, aqueduct, and access bridge involved difficult projects; furthermore, the issue of land occupation at the canal mouth took longer to resolve, and construction started somewhat late. In order to avoid hindering water usage and affecting the progress of the project, it was decided to carry out the construction in phases, and it is currently being vigorously constructed under the guidance of the Hebei Provincial Engineering Team.

　　石家庄专区完成修渠
    二十五万亩水田可及时灌溉
    【本报石家庄讯】河北石家庄专区完成渠道整修，二十五万余亩水田得到及时灌溉。该区由于去冬准备工作的充分及今春各级政府的大力领导与贷粮辅助，使万亩以上大渠九道、千亩以上大渠十六道、小渠一百余道顺利完成，完成了春季工程的大整修。四月初旬各渠即相继放水。
    在渠道整修上，一般是由受益地户负担来进行整理、补修，对工程艰巨开支较大的渠道，政府给以贷粮辅助，保证其按计划完成。因为渠道整修直接关系着群众的生产利益，所以在动工兴修中表现很积极。如平山贾壁滩灌溉二千二百一十三亩土地，今年新修防洪垛子两个，补修一个，用石头二千七百七十五公方，开石渠三十丈，用石灰二十一万斤的工程，在群众积极努力下，经二十天就完成，四月七日便开始放水浇麦。该区较大渠道如灵正、计三、永盛、大同等渠，因渠口冲毁冲没需改线改口或修筑护岸的工程，群众力量不足，工程技术差，屡坏屡修，不能修成较永久巩固的工程。去冬及今春该省人民政府水利工程队帮助勘测作计划，并亲临指导，政府又贷给小米，对群众情绪鼓舞很大，计三、灵正、永盛三渠皆提前与按期完成。只有大同渠因为进水闸、二百米的护岸、渡槽、便桥等工程艰巨；另方面渠口占地问题解决时间较长，动工稍晚没有完成。为了不防碍使水及不影响工程进行，决定分期施工，在河北省工程队指导下，正大力突击修筑。
