　　Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: After a long period of planning, the Menzies government of Australia has submitted a bill to Parliament to declare the Australian Communist Party illegal. This fascist bill, which is currently being debated, will not only declare the Communist Party illegal but will also suppress all progressive trade union activities and people's movements in Australia.
    According to a United Press International report from Canberra: In his speech to the Lower House on the 27th, Australian Prime Minister Menzies put forward the following six proposals: (1) To declare the Communist Party illegal, dissolve it, and confiscate its property. (2) To authorize the government to declare "all trade unions and similar organizations controlled by the Communist Party as illegal." (3) To arrest personnel who continue to operate in the above-mentioned organizations. (4) After May 10, the Governor-General will publish a list of any so-called Communist Party members and groups "harmful to the country." (5) Those whose names have been published shall not be employed by the government or its affiliated agencies. (6) Those whose names have been published shall not work in important coal mines, shipyards, transportation departments, engineering departments, and power industries.
    The Menzies government's fascist bill is being carried out under the instigation of US imperialism, which is trying to turn Australia into a new war base. A Sydney dispatch from the Electric Communications Agency on the 27th stated: Since the Menzies government came to power, Australia has completely plunged into the American war bloc in the Pacific. The recent signing of secret treaties and the frequent mutual visits of Australian and American soldiers have made the United States more insistent on destroying the Australian Communist Party and progressive forces. The Menzies government, disregarding widespread warnings, still put forward this bill, mostly due to the relentless pressure exerted by the United States. Before submitting the bill, Menzies also consulted with senior officials of the American Embassy, absorbing their experience in proposing fascist legislation in the US Congress.
    The Menzies government's reactionary behavior has aroused strong opposition from the Australian Communist Party and the working class. According to an Electric Communications Agency report: Australian Communist Party Chairman Dixon has issued a statement on the matter, stating that the Communist Party will fight by all means. The Party knows that it will surely receive the support of the international workers' movement in its struggle for peace, democracy, improved living standards, and socialism. Although the Communist Party may be declared illegal, it cannot be dissolved. It will continue to work. At the same time, Australian workers have launched a widespread protest movement. In the largest coal mine in New South Wales, workers have held a protest strike. Other trade unions are also preparing to counter the government's conspiracy. The vast majority of trade unions have frankly stated that if the government interferes in trade union affairs, they will launch a relentless counterattack against the government.

　　孟席斯政府提出宣布澳共非法议案
    澳共声明决继续战斗
    新南威尔士煤矿工人举行抗议罢工
    【新华社三日讯】澳大利亚的孟席斯政府经过长期的策划后，已向国会提出宣布澳大利亚共产党为非法的法案。这个目前正在辩论中的法西斯的法案，将不仅宣布共产党为非法，而且将镇压澳国一切进步的工会活动和人民运动。
    据合众社坎培拉消息：澳总理孟席斯在其二十七日向下院发表的演说中，提出了如下六点建议：（一）宣布共产党为非法，予以解散，并没收其财产。（二）授权政府宣布“一切由共产党所控制的工会及类似组织为非法”。（三）逮捕上述组织中继续活动的人员。（四）在五月十日以后，总督将公布任何所谓“危害国家的”共产党党员与团体的名单。（五）凡名单已被公布的人，政府或其所属机构，一概不得雇用。（六）凡名单被公布的人，不得在重要煤矿、造船厂、运输部门、工程部门及动力工业部门中工作。
    孟席斯政府这一法西斯化的法案，是在力图将澳大利亚变为新战争基地的美帝国主义的怂恿下进行的。电通社悉尼二十七日电称：自从孟席斯政府当政以来，澳大利亚即完全投入了美国在太平洋的战争集团。不久以前签订的秘密条约，澳、美军人的多次互相访问，使得美国更加坚持要摧毁澳国共产党和进步力量。孟席斯政府不顾普遍的警告，仍然提出了这个法案，大部分是由于美国所施的无情压力所致。孟席斯在提出该法以前，并曾与美国大使馆的高级官员进行磋商，吸取他们在美国国会提出法西斯立法的经验。
    孟席斯政府这一反动行为，已引起澳大利亚共产党及工人阶级的强烈反对。电通社报道：澳共主席狄克逊已就此事发表声明称：共产党将尽一切办法战斗。党知道它在争取和平、民主、提高生活水准和社会主义的斗争中，必定会得到国际工人运动的支持。共产党虽然可能被宣布为非法，但它不可能被解散。它将继续工作下去。同时，澳大利亚工人已展开广泛的抗议运动。在新南威尔士的最大煤矿中，工人已举行了抗议罢工。其他工会也正在准备反击政府的阴谋。绝大部分的工会都率直地声明：如果政府实行干涉工会事务，它们将向政府发动无情的反击。
