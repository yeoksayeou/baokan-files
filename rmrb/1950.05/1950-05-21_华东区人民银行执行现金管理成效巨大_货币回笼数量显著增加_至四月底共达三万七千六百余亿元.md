Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 17th. Since March, the branches of the People's Bank of China in East China and its affiliated provinces and cities have established a treasury system and implemented the cash management and transfer system for state organs, accelerating currency withdrawal and saving cash expenditures. By the end of April, a total of 37,669 billion yuan had been withdrawn, playing a significant role in stabilizing prices.

    The People's Bank of China in East China has now established 46 issuing treasuries, 1 national treasury area treasury, 9 sub-treasuries, 456 branch treasuries, and 112 storage points. By the end of April, 821.1 billion yuan of government bond funds had been deposited into the treasury; from March 1st to the end of April, tax revenue deposited into the treasury amounted to approximately 1,638.5 billion yuan. In terms of enterprise treasuries, since the establishment of the Shanghai branch of the trade treasury on March 7th, followed by the establishment of 11 branch treasuries in Nanjing, Wuxi, Jinan, and other places, over 887.5 billion yuan of currency had been withdrawn by the end of April. The railway treasury has established 8 branch treasuries in Shanghai, Qingdao, Bengbu, Hangzhou, and other places, with a total of 401.2 billion yuan of cash deposited into the treasury by the end of April. The telecommunications treasury began to be established in mid-April, and currently, a total of 10 branch treasuries have been established in Shanghai, Jinan, Wuhu, Hefei, and other places, with 18.6 billion yuan also deposited into the treasury by the end of April. The fuel industry treasury has also been established in Shanghai and Dezhou.

    The effectiveness of cash management implemented by the People's Bank of China in various parts of East China is first reflected in the large increase in deposit figures, and the power of currency withdrawal has been significantly enhanced. Taking the Shanghai branch as an example, since the establishment of the enterprise treasury until the end of April, a total of 1,740.2 billion yuan of currency has been withdrawn, an increase of more than six times compared to the deposit balance of 246.4 billion yuan at the end of February. Secondly, due to the use of special checks, restrictions on cash withdrawals, and increased transfers, cash expenditures have been greatly reduced. In April, the total amount of receipts and payments by government agencies, schools, and state-owned enterprises included more than 25,000 cash transactions, amounting to more than 257.2 billion yuan; more than 81,000 transfer transactions, amounting to 7,943.3 billion yuan. The number of transfer transactions was 3.24 times the number of cash transactions, and the amount of transfer transactions was 30.88 times the amount of cash transactions. Compared to February, before the implementation of cash management, when the amount of transfer transactions was 15.67 times the amount of cash transactions, cash expenditures were reduced by half. At the same time, due to the widespread establishment of issuing treasuries throughout the region, cash flow and allocation have also become more flexible. The average reserve amount of cash in the Shanghai branch in April was 14% lower than last year, and it was sufficient to guarantee payment at any time.

　　华东区人民银行执行现金管理成效巨大
    货币回笼数量显著增加
    至四月底共达三万七千六百余亿元
    【新华社上海十七日电】中国人民银行华东区行所属各省市分行自三月份起建立金库制度，执行关于国家机关的现金管理和转账制度后，加速货币回笼，节约现金开支，截至四月底止共回笼货币达三万七千六百六十九亿元，对稳定物价起了极大的作用。
    人民银行华东区行现已建立四十六个发行库，一个国库区库，九个分库，四百五十六个支库，一百十二处保管点。至四月底为止，公债款项入库八千二百十一亿元；从三月一日至四月底，税收入库数字约达一万六千三百八十五亿元。企业金库方面，贸易金库自三月七日建立上海分库以后，接着建立南京、无锡、济南等共十一个分库，至四月底止共回笼货币八千八百七十五亿余元。铁道金库已在上海、青岛、蚌埠、杭州等地建立八个分库，至四月底止共入库现金四千零十二亿元。电信金库四月中旬开始建立，现全区共成立十个分库，分布于上海、济南、芜湖、合肥等处，至四月底亦已入库一百八十六亿元。燃料工业金库，亦在上海、德州两地先后建立。
    华东区各地人民银行执行现金管理的成效，首先表现在存款数字的大量增加，回笼通货的力量已显著增强。以上海分行为例，自企业金库建立以来至四月底止，总计回笼通货一万七千四百零二亿元，较二月底的存款余额二千四百六十四亿余元，增加了六倍以上。其次，因为使用专用支票，限制提现，转账增加，现金开支大为减少。四月份机关、学校、公营企业等收付总额中，现金为二万五千余笔，金额二千五百七十二亿余元；转账为八万一千余笔，金额七万九千四百三十三亿余元，转账笔数为现金笔数的三点二四倍，转账金额为现金金额的三十点八八倍。与二月份未实行现金管理时转账金额为现金额的一五点六七倍相较，现金收支节约了一半。同时，由于全区发行库的普遍建立，现金流转调拨也更为灵活，上海分行四月份现金的平均准备额，较去年减低百分之十四，且足以保证随时支付。
