　　Bi Lanxiang
    ——A Record of a Female Lathe Apprentice at the Fengtai Vehicle Inspection Section of the Tianjin Railway Bureau

    I.
    Today she is no longer
    A female worker in the oil line room,
    Bi Lanxiang,
    Has gloriously striven for
    The machine shop.
    Since the Communist Party came
    Like the sun appearing in cloudy skies,
    Bi Lanxiang actively takes the lead,
    And was approved as a member of the Communist Youth League.
    Work harder for May Day,
    Produce more for July First,
    Male workers are fervently producing to support the front,
    Bi Lanxiang excitedly watches, her eyes reddened.
    Are women less capable than men?
    Bi Lanxiang is determined to break this old idea.
    Her great belief has won the praise of the masses,
    Bi Lanxiang is happier than she was during New Year's as a child.
    Lathe foreman Hai Rong became her master,
    The "Master-Apprentice Contract" was announced to everyone.
    The older workers all worried for them,
    How could a "girl" possibly handle a machine lathe?!
    Bi Lanxiang asked the old masters to rest assured:
    "Our working class has been liberated,
    First and foremost, we rely on the Communist Party,
    Secondly, we rely on labor and production.
    Women in the new society must strive to equal men,
    And dedicate all our strength to the revolution."
    II.
    The machine shop's belt wheels rumble loudly,
    Sparks from the grinding wheel sting the eyes.
    Bi Lanxiang,
    In rough clothes,
    With oily black hands,
    Works like she is fighting a battle.
    Wielding the wrench,
    Raising the iron hammer,
    Following the master's instructions,
    Learning from the energy of her fellow apprentices.
    The machine shop has one more person sweeping,
    And she even has a share in digging air raid shelters.
    If anyone tries to do heavy work for her,
    Bi Lanxiang fights to not let go.
    Heart is mouth and mouth is heart,
    Always one saying on her lips:
    "Women must overcome difficulties,
    Each person has their own production to do!"
    Never seen her frown,
    Never heard half a complaint,
    No difficulty can frighten a member of the Communist Youth League.
    All the masters in the shop praise in unison:
    "Bi Lanxiang,
    Is as good as a man!"
    Since she came to the machine shop,
    The master's lathe bed is wiped spotlessly clean,
    Her diligent hands reach every place,
    And she and the machine have become inseparable friends.
    Every day, every day,
    The last one to leave the machine shop
    Is this young girl.
    Watch her change into clean clothes,
    Black hands turn into white hands,
    Wipe the sweat from her face,
    And hurry into literacy class,
    Cheerfully singing in her mouth:
    "Chairman Mao leads us to stand up..."

     April 15, 1950, in Fengtai

　　毕兰香
    ——记天津铁路局丰台检车段一个女旋盘学习工
    窦圻
    一
    今天不再是
    油线房的女工，
    毕兰香，
    光荣地争取到了
    机械场。
    自从来了共产党
    像阴天里露出了太阳，
    毕兰香积极带头干，
    被批准为女青年团员。
    “五一”加油干，
    “七一”多生产，
    男工友轰轰烈烈生产支前，
    毕兰香兴奋的看红了眼。
    女人不如男人能干？
    毕兰香决心要破除这个旧观念。
    伟大的信念得到了群众的称赞，
    毕兰香比小时过年还喜欢。
    旋盘工班长海荣当了师傅，
    “师徒合同”向大家宣布。
    年老的工友都替他俩捏了一把汗，
    “女孩子”那里干得了机器旋盘？！
    毕兰香请老师傅们放心：
    “咱工人阶级翻身，
    头一个靠共产党，
    再一个就靠劳动生产。
    新社会的女子要向男子看齐，
    为革命献出全身的力量。”
    二
    机械场的皮带轮隆隆的响，
    砂轮的火星刺人眼睛。
    毕兰香，
    一身粗衣裳，
    油黑的双手，
    干活像打仗。
    舞动螺丝把，
    举起铁鎯头，
    照着师傅的吩咐，
    学习师兄们的劲头。
    机械场多了一个清扫的人，
    连挖防空壕都有她一份。
    谁要替她干点重活，
    毕兰香抢着不放松。
    心是口来口是心，
    总是一句口头语：
    “妇女要克服困难，
    各人有各人的生产！”
    没见过她皱一下眉头，
    没听说过半句怨言，
    任何困难都唬不住女青年团员。
    全场的师傅同声夸赞：
    “毕兰香，
    比得上男子汉！”
    自从她来了机械场，
    班师傅的旋盘床擦的油光，
    勤劳的手伸向每一处，
    人和机器成了分不开的朋友。
    每天，每天，
    从机械场最后走出的一个
    年青的姑娘。
    看她换上一身干净的服装，
    黑手变成了白手，
    擦掉脸上的汗珠，
    匆匆跑进识字班，
    嘴里还快乐的歌唱：
    “毛主席领导咱们把身翻……”
     一九五○年四月十五日于丰台
