Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, May 12th. The Kuomintang reactionaries, running dogs of American imperialism, have recently boasted about so-called "relief for compatriots in disaster-stricken mainland areas," which has been proven in Fuzhou to be a completely poisonous scheme to slaughter the people. At 8 PM on the 8th of this month, two American-made bandit planes scattered leaflets over the Hongshan Bridge in the western suburbs of Fuzhou and dropped thirty to forty bags of rice. The leaflets claimed to be "relief" for disaster-stricken compatriots in Fujian, in an attempt to deceive residents and make them relax their vigilance against the bandit planes. Then, the next day (the 9th) at 11 AM, three American-made bandit planes flew into the airspace over Fuzhou City and dropped sixteen bombs in the commercial district on the north bank of the Minjiang River, causing great casualties. The bandit planes' bombing was extremely insidious. Most of the bombs dropped were time bombs, exploding successively after fifteen minutes, half an hour, one hour, and one and a half hours after landing. Because ordinary citizens were unable to identify them, casualties were very heavy. As of the afternoon of the 10th, statistics showed that there were 175 people with minor and serious injuries, and more than 70 people died from serious injuries or were crushed to death. The most tragic case was that of Pan Hedi, the owner of Wang Da Mei Brush Shop, his three sons, and three shop assistants, a total of seven people, were all killed. Only an elderly mother in her eighties, three daughters-in-law, and two infants under the age of two were left. The people of the city are extremely indignant at the bandits' brutal atrocities and shameless tricks. When the bandit planes bombed, the city's garrison troops, the Public Security Bureau fire brigade, and various public and private hospitals were dispatched to maintain order and rescue the victims.

    美制蒋机滥炸福州居民
　　种种无耻毒计完全暴露
    【新华社福州十二日电】美帝国主义走狗国民党反动派最近吹嘘的所谓“救济大陆灾胞”，已在福州证明完全是屠杀人民的毒计。本月八日下午八时，美制匪机两架在福州市西郊洪山桥上空散发传单并投掷大米三、四十包，传单上声称系“救济”福建灾胞，借以迷惑居民，使放松对于匪机的警惕。接着，在第二天（九日）上午十一时，美制匪机三架即飞入福州市空，在闽江北岸商业区投弹十六枚、造成极大死伤。匪机此次轰炸极为阴险，所投多为定时炸弹，落地后相隔十五分钟、半小时、一小时、一小时半陆续爆炸。一般市民因未能识别，故死伤甚重。截至十日下午统计，轻重伤者一百七十五人，重伤不能医治和压死者七十余人。最惨者为王大美毛笔店老板潘河俤及其三个儿子和三个店员一共七人全被炸死，只剩下一个八十多岁的老母亲、三个媳妇和两个未满两岁的婴孩。全市人民对匪帮此种凶恶暴行和无耻诡计极为愤慨。当匪机轰炸时，市警备部队、公安局消防队及各公私立医院均出动维护秩序及抢救难胞。
