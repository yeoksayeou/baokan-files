　　A Small Number of Finance and Grain Cadres Disregard Grain Storage
　　Serious Losses of Public Grain in Lingbi, Suxian
    Anhui North Administrative Office Orders Thorough Investigation and Prosecution
    [Hefei News] According to the Anhui North Daily News: In the preliminary material inventory and warehouse inspection in Suxian Prefecture, it was discovered that public grain in many warehouses in Suxian and Lingbi was moldy and rotten, and there were also individual cases of embezzlement.
    The Tiefo District warehouse in Suxian currently has 500,000 jin of autumn grain. The county government's grain inspection team recently inspected the grain in the district and found 2,000 jin of moldy and rotten soybeans (unusable), 50,000 jin of sorghum sprouting and turning green, and 142,000 jin of sorghum and beans that were generating excessive heat. The main reason for this disastrous result is that since the grain was put into the warehouse last year, the warehouse in this district has been locked and sealed, and the windows have also been blocked. The warehouse staff thought that this would solve all problems, and never took the grain out to be turned over and sun-dried. After such a long time, and with no air circulating inside, and with frequent recent rains, although the commissioner's office and the county government had repeatedly ordered warehouse inspections and turnovers, this never attracted the attention of the district's leading organs. In particular, Zhang Shutang and Huang Changli, the warehouse directors directly responsible, and Wang Qihui, the finance and grain district member, showed no concern for the grain in the warehouse. Since the autumn grain was put into the warehouse, Wang Qihui, the finance and grain district member, had not inspected the warehouse even once. After the matter was discovered, Zhang Shutang and Huang Changli, the warehouse directors, did not face up to their mistakes, believing that the responsibility was everyone's, and emphasized that "there is a lot of cloudy and rainy weather, and all districts will have rotten grain."
    In Lingbi County, 13,500 jin of sorghum and wheat, received last spring by the grain stations and confiscated from the enemy, remain in the three small warehouses of Datianjia, Xiaosunjia, and Dashanjia in Weiji District, and have not been reported to the county government, nor have they been consolidated and properly stored. The county government has also not inspected the district, resulting in all of it being infested by insects and mold. Many small warehouses in Changshan District have not yet been consolidated, giving bad elements opportunities to embezzle. For example, Ying Huaming, the director of the Guxi Township Farmers' Association and a work team member, colluded with village and group cadres to privately distribute 1,650 jin of public grain.
    In addition, 4,000 jin of sorghum flour was stored in the county government by the Tanghe Engineering Office in Lingbi, but all of it became moldy and rotten due to mutual buck-passing and irresponsibility.
    The above series of major loss incidents caused by bureaucracy and irresponsibility towards the people's and the state's property happened to occur in the severely disaster-stricken area of northern Anhui, "which is even more unforgivable." On the one hand, the People's Government and the Communist Party Committee are leading the people in tense and serious efforts to fight against the severe famine by all means, but on the other hand, a small number of bureaucrats are so numb and indifferent, disregarding the people's suffering, and causing major losses to state property. The Anhui North Administrative Office believes that the above situation is extremely serious, and in addition to telegraphing the Suxian Commissioner's Office on April 23 to thoroughly investigate and propose a handling opinion as soon as possible, it has also sent a special person to inspect. Once the materials are collected, a decision will be made.

### 少数财粮干部漠视粮食保管　宿县灵璧公粮损失严重　皖北行署电令彻查追究

　　少数财粮干部漠视粮食保管
　　宿县灵璧公粮损失严重 
    皖北行署电令彻查追究
    【合肥讯】据皖北日报消息：宿县专区在初步的清理物资和清查仓库中，发现宿县、灵璧多处仓库公粮霉烂，并有个别贪污现象。
    宿县铁佛区仓库现存秋粮五十万斤，县府查粮组最近到该区查粮，发现霉烂黄豆二千斤（已不堪使用），秫秫生芽及变绿色的五万斤，发大热的秫秫、豆子有十四万二千斤，产生这种恶果的原因，主要由于该区仓库自从去年粮食入仓后，就一直把仓房门锁住贴上封条，窗户也堵塞，仓库的人员认为这样就算万事大吉了，从未出仓翻晒。时间如此长久，室内又没有空气，近来又时常阴雨，虽然专署、县府曾三令五申查仓翻折，但终未引起该区领导机关的重视。尤其是负直接责任的仓库主任张树棠、黄昌礼及财粮区员王启会，对仓库粮食竟毫不关心。自从秋粮入仓后，财粮区员王启会连一次仓都未查过。事情经察觉后，仓库主任张树棠、黄昌礼对自己的错误还不正视，认为责任是大家的，强调“天阴雨多，那区都要烂粮”。
    灵璧县韦集区大田家、小孙家、大山家三处小仓，还是去春接收粮站及没收敌资大秫、小麦一万三千五百多斤，至今未向县府呈报，更没有实行并仓好好保管，县府也未到该区检查，以致全部被虫蚀和霉烂。长山区很多小仓至今仍未并，给了坏分子贪污钻空子机会，仅古西乡农会主任和工作队员英化明等即串通村组干部私分公粮一千六百五十斤。
    此外，灵璧唐河工程处有四千斤秫面存在县府，因互相推诿不负责任而全部霉烂。
    上述一连串由于官僚主义对人民国家资财不负责任所造成的重大损失事件，恰恰又是发生在皖北重灾区，“更加是一种不容宽恕的事情。”一方面人民政府和中共党委在领导人民紧张严肃地想尽一切办法与严重的灾荒搏斗，另一方面却有少数官僚主义者这样麻木不仁，漠视人民疾苦，竟而造成国家财产的重大损失。皖北行署认为以上情况极为严重，除于四月二十三日电促宿县专署彻查追究迅速提出处理意见外，并派专人前往检查，一俟材料汇集后即将作出处理的决定。
