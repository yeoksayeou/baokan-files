To Comrade Wenguang:

    Your question has been answered by the Head Office of the People's Bank of China as follows: The par value of the savings unit was originally calculated based on Wanshoushan macaroni. Now that this macaroni has ceased to be produced and sold, it has been changed to Beijing macaroni ("August 1st" macaroni) as the calculation standard. However, there is a difference in price between the two types of flour. To prevent existing depositors from suffering losses, we have already jointly studied the matter with the responsible persons of the Beijing Grain Company and the Fuxing Flour Mill (the factory that produces Wanshoushan macaroni). The result is that one *jin* of Wanshoushan macaroni is equivalent to 1.095 *jin* of Beijing macaroni. The new "Standard Commodity Unit Par Value" has been implemented since April 27th. Unexpired accounts will continue to be handled according to the original calculation method. However, all previous Wanshoushan macaroni in the par value will be converted to Beijing macaroni for calculation, that is, the content of the old par value unit includes 1.095 *jin* of Beijing macaroni, 1 *jin* of corn flour, and 1 *chi* of No. 2 Factory Red Five Blessings Cloth. This does not disadvantage existing depositors in any way. For details, please refer to the Beijing Branch's announcement published in this newspaper on April 27th.

　　折实单位牌价已改按“八一”通粉计算文光君：
    你的问题经中国人民银行总行答复如下：折实储蓄单位牌价原按万寿山通粉为计算标准，现因该粉停止制售，改以北京通粉（八一粉）为计算标准，但两种面粉在价格上是有差别，为使旧存户不受损失起见，早经与北京市粮食公司及福兴面粉厂（制万寿山粉厂）负责人共同研究，得出结果，即万寿山通粉一市斤等于北京通粉一·○九五市斤。新“标准实物单位牌价”自四月二十七日起已经实行。未到期存户，仍按原有计算办法继续办理。惟牌价中所有以前万寿山通粉一律以北京通粉折合计算，即旧牌价单位内容包括北京通粉一·○九五市斤，玉米面一市斤，二厂红五福布一尺。这对于旧存户毫不吃亏。详情请参阅四月二十七日本报所载北京分行公告。
