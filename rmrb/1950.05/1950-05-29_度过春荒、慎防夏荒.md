It is reported that the disaster situation in various regions has stopped developing, and it is hoped that the spring famine will be overcome. This is a great victory for the hardworking Chinese people and the People's Government, working together with one heart and one mind, and relying on their own strength to overcome difficulties.

The experiences of various regions have proven that in areas where importance is attached to production and disaster relief work, the principle of combining production for self-salvation, social mutual assistance, and government assistance is implemented, leading cadres go deep into disaster areas to arrange and inspect work, and rely on the strength of the masses to promptly mobilize and organize disaster victims to carry out emergency drainage, replanting, develop and support various sideline productions, use work as relief, and build water conservancy projects, the disaster can be overcome or alleviated, and the lives of disaster victims can be guaranteed.

Conversely, in areas where the severity of the disaster is not sufficiently recognized, the spirit of "disaster relief is like fighting a fire" is not grasped, the Central People's Government's principle of "production for self-salvation" is violated, a purely relief-oriented view and a mentality of dependence are held, the leadership is divorced from reality, and disaster victims are not mobilized or organized to carry out sideline production, use work as relief, and other work, disaster relief work will take a detour, the disaster situation will continue to develop, or cannot be overcome in a timely manner.

We should cherish these experiences gained at the cost of life in the face of serious disasters. We should remember that when doing any work, as long as we believe in the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize and organize the masses, give play to the masses' infinite creativity, and at the same time find ways for the masses, and solve possible and already occurring problems in a planned and led manner, we can overcome any difficulties.

Now, the serious disaster situation has stopped developing, and the wheat harvest is also coming soon. This is the result and favorable conditions we have obtained through hard struggle, but we should not become complacent, relaxed, or paralyzed because of this. We should fully recognize that under the long-term reactionary rule, river embankments have long been out of repair, especially the Kuomintang bandit gang's crimes of breaching dikes, destroying dams, and forcibly changing river courses, which have caused the silting of lakes and the obstruction of rivers. We should recognize that in areas where floods have occurred, due to the low-lying terrain, water is easily injected, and twelve years of war and twelve years of inflation have emptied the people's wealth and weakened the material basis for disaster resistance. Therefore, after overcoming the spring famine, some areas may still experience a summer famine. We must understand that only after the victorious end of the war, the repair of water conservancy projects, and the improvement of farmers' productivity can disasters be fundamentally resolved. To this end, we must make a hundredfold effort and be vigilant at all times to avoid and reduce disasters.

Today, what are the main issues in production and disaster relief work?

First, preparations should be made in advance to prevent summer floods. Party, government, military, and civilian personnel in various regions, especially in areas where disasters frequently occur, should immediately organize forces to carry out summer flood prevention work. The experience of Henan, Pingyuan, and Shandong provinces in ensuring that the Yellow River had no breaches for thousands of miles during the autumn floods last year should be valued by all regions.

Second, disaster victims should be organized under leadership to carry out sideline production. In areas where sideline production has already begun, but the quality of products does not meet standards, sales channels have not been opened, resulting in cooperative accumulation of funds and a decline in the enthusiasm of disaster victims, efforts should be made to find sales channels, products of poor quality should be sold at reduced prices, and contact should be made with trade agencies; trade agencies at all levels should also actively support disaster victims in carrying out sideline production. In areas where disaster victims have not yet been well mobilized and organized for sideline production, they must be quickly mobilized and organized. In the matter of sideline production, Hebei Province's experience is worth noting by all regions.

Third, work should be carried out with planned work-for-relief and water conservancy construction. In the past, in some areas, due to insufficient preparation and planning before starting the construction of dikes, there have been cases where they were washed away by water once they were built, and it took several repairs to complete them. There have also been cases where plans were changed midway, wasting manpower and material resources, and some dike projects, although completed, did not meet the standards and were prone to danger. Therefore, before the summer flood season, all regions and water conservancy departments at all levels should strengthen the leadership and inspection of this work.

Fourth, it is necessary to distinguish between merits and demerits, train cadres, and improve cadres. Most of the staff in the disaster areas have been able to share weal and woe with the masses and serve the people wholeheartedly in the struggle against the disasters. However, in some areas, especially in the newly liberated areas, due to the large proportion of newly promoted cadres and retained old Baojia personnel, there have also been cases of few working methods and corruption and favoritism. In individual senior leading organs, there have also been phenomena of extravagance and waste. To this end, strict criticism and self-criticism must be carried out. Cadres who have made achievements in their work should be commended and rewarded, and staff members who have made mistakes must be corrected and punished. Only in this way can our production and disaster relief work be fully guaranteed.

In addition, for the resettlement of mobile disaster victims, the development of social mutual assistance and mutual aid, the relief of families of martyrs, families of military personnel, and widows and orphans, as well as the prevention of eating green wheat before the summer harvest and the promotion of thrift after the summer harvest, disaster areas should plan according to local conditions.

We have relied on our own strength to stop the development of the disaster situation. In the future, as long as we can continue to rely on the masses and implement the principles of production, disaster relief, thrift, and mutual assistance in a led and planned manner, then we will surely be able to completely overcome this year's disaster.

### 度过春荒、慎防夏荒

　　度过春荒、慎防夏荒
    据报道，各地灾情已经停止发展，春荒可望度过。这是勤劳的中国人民和人民政府协力同心，依靠自己的力量，战胜困难的伟大胜利。
    各地的经验证明：凡是重视了生产救灾工作，贯彻了生产自救、社会互助和政府协助三者结合的方针，领导干部深入灾区布置和检查工作，并依靠群众的力量，及时地发动和组织灾民进行抢险排水，抢种补种，开展和扶助各种副业生产，以工代赈，兴修水利等工作的地区，灾荒就能被克服或减轻，灾民的生活，也就能得到保证。
    相反，凡是对灾荒的严重性认识不够，未能把握“救灾如救火”的精神，违背中央人民政府的“生产自救”方针，抱着单纯的救济观点、依赖心理，领导和实际脱节，不发动、组织灾民进行副业生产、以工代赈等工作的地区，救灾工作就会走弯路，灾情就会继续发展，或不能及时加以克服。
    我们应该珍贵这些在严重的灾难中以生命换来的经验。我们应该记住，在做任何工作的时候，只要我们相信群众，依靠群众，发动和组织群众，发扬群众的无穷的创造力，同时给群众想办法，及有领导有计划地解决可能发生的和已经发生的问题，我们就能战胜任何的困难。
    现在，严重的灾情是停止发展了，麦收也很快就要到来。这是我们经过努力搏斗所获得的成绩和争取到的有利条件，但我们不应因此而产生丝毫自满松懈和麻痹的情绪。我们应该充分认识到过去在长期的反动统治下，江河堤岸早已失修，特别是国民党匪帮决堤、毁坝、强改河道等等罪行所造成的湖泊淤塞，河流不畅等情况，认识到发生过水灾的地区，由于地形低洼，水易注入，以及十二年的战争和十二年来的通货膨胀，使人民的家底空虚，抗灾的物质基础薄弱的事实。因此，度过春荒以后，还有部分地区可能发生夏荒。我们必须懂得：只有在胜利结束战争，修整水利和提高农民的生产力之后，灾荒才能根本解决。为此我们要百倍努力，随时警惕，以避免灾荒和减少灾荒。
    今天，在生产救灾工作中，主要的还有那些问题呢？
    首先要预作准备，防止夏汛。各地党政军民，特别是经常发生灾荒的地区，应该立即组织力量，进行夏防工作。河南、平原、山东诸省去年秋汛时，确保千里黄河无一决口的抢险防汛经验，应该受到各地的重视。
    其次，要有领导的组织灾民进行副业生产。凡是已经开始副业生产，因产品质量不合规格，销路未能打开，发生了合作社积压资金和灾民生产情绪低落的地区，应该多方找寻销路，质量差的产品应该减价出售，同时更应该和贸易机关取得联系；各级贸易机关，也应主动地扶助灾民进行副业生产。在至今还未很好发动和组织灾民进行副业生产的地区，必须迅速发动和组织起来。在副业生产的问题上，河北省的经验值得各地注意。
    第三，要有计划地进行以工代赈，兴修水利。过去，在某些地区因动工修堤前的准备和计划不够，曾发生了修一次被水冲垮一次，连修几次才完工的情况，也曾发生过中途变更计划，浪费了人力和物力的现象，还有某些堤工虽已完成，但不够标准，容易发生危险。因此，各地区和各级水利部门，在夏汛之前，应该加强这一工作的领导和检查。
    第四，要分清功过是非，整训干部，提高干部。各地灾区的工作人员，在与灾荒搏斗中，绝大部分是能够和群众共甘苦，全心全力为人民服务的。但也有些地区，特别是在新解放区，由于调升的新干部和留用的旧保甲人员比例很大，因此也产生了工作办法不多和贪污徇私的情事。在个别高级领导机关，也有铺张浪费的现象。为此，必须展开严格的批评和自我批评。工作有成绩的干部，应该受到表扬和奖励，犯错误的工作人员，必须受到纠举和惩处。只有这样，我们的生产救灾工作，才能得到充分的保证。
    此外，对于流动灾民的安置，社会互助互济的展开，烈士家属、军人家属和鳏寡孤独的救济，以及夏收前防止吃青，夏收后提倡节约等等，各灾区都应该根据当地情况，有所策划。
    我们已经依靠自己的力量停止了灾情的发展。今后，只要我们能够继续依靠群众，有领导有计划地贯彻生产救灾节约互助的方针，那末，我们就一定能够完全战胜今年的灾荒。
