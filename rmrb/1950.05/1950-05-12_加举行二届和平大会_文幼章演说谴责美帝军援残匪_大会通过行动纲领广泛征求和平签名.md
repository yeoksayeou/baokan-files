Xinhua News Agency, Toronto, 11th: According to TASS, the second Canadian Peace Congress was held in Toronto on the 6th. Approximately 1,500 delegates from all over Canada attended the congress.

The congress began with an opening speech by Chairman Parr. When the youth representatives from Montreal passed the "Torch of Peace," which they had relayed from Montreal to Toronto, to Wen Youzhang, Chairman of the Canadian Peace Congress, the delegates responded with prolonged applause.

Dr. Wen Youzhang delivered a long speech at the meeting. He emphasized that the main achievement in the twelve months since the establishment of the Canadian Peace Congress was the movement to collect signatures on the petition to ban atomic bombs. Two hundred thousand people have already signed this petition.

Wen Youzhang then pointed out that Canada, until recently, had been supplying Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandits with military supplies and refusing the legal Chinese government's participation in the United Nations, thereby undermining the United Nations organization. He said that if the United Nations is to function normally, it needs to follow the example of many other countries and immediately recognize the government of the People's Republic of China.

During the discussions, the speakers unanimously emphasized that the struggle for peace is the struggle for work, civil rights, culture, and life. They also emphasized the importance of the unity of all peace defenders for the success of this struggle.

The congress unanimously adopted a political resolution entitled "Participate in the Peace Movement," and also passed a statement expressing agreement with the call of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Partisans of Peace for the Second World Peace Congress to be held in Italy in the second half of this year.

When adopting the action program, the congress proposed to collect 500,000 signatures by October 2nd on a new petition based on the appeal of the Stockholm Conference of the World Peace Council.

Finally, the congress elected the National Council. Dr. Wen Youzhang was re-elected as chairman, and Jackson was re-elected as secretary.

　　加举行二届和平大会
　　文幼章演说谴责美帝军援残匪 
    大会通过行动纲领广泛征求和平签名
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社多伦多讯：加拿大第二届和平大会于六日在多伦多举行。出席大会的有加拿大全国各地的代表约一千五百人。
    大会首先由主席帕尔致开幕词。当蒙特利尔的青年代表把他们从蒙特利尔用接力跑传到多伦多来的“和平火炬”递与加拿大和平大会主席文幼章的时候，各代表报以历久不绝的掌声。
    文幼章博士在会上发表长篇演说。他强调指出：在加拿大和平大会成立以来的十二个月中所获得的主要成就，是征求在禁止原子弹请愿书上签名的运动。在这个请愿书上签名的已有二十万人。
    文幼章接着指出：加拿大直到最近为止还以军火供给蒋介石残余匪帮，并拒绝合法的中国政府参加联合国，因而破坏了联合国组织。他说：如要联合国能够正常活动，那就需要仿效许多别的国家的榜样，立即承认中华人民共和国政府。
    大会在进行讨论时，各发言人均一致强调指出，为和平而作的斗争，就是为工作、公民权利、文化和生活而作的斗争。他们并强调指出所有和平保卫者的团结对于这个斗争成功的重要性。
    大会一致通过一项题为《参加和平运动》的政治决议，同时通过一项声明，表示同意世界拥护和平大会常委会关于本年下半年在意大利召开第二次世界和平大会的呼吁。
    大会在通过行动纲领的时候，提议在十月二日之前征求五十万人在根据和大常委会斯德哥尔摩会议呼吁书而作的新请愿书上签名。
    大会最后选出全国理事会。文幼章博士再度当选主席，詹克逊连任秘书。
