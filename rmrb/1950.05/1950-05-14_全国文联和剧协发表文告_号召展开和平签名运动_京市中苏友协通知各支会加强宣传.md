Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, in response to the call of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, has issued a proclamation calling on Chinese literary and art workers to launch a signature campaign. The proclamation pointed out that the China Defense of World Peace Congress has already enthusiastically responded to the call of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace on April 28 and launched a warm signature campaign throughout the country. Literary and art workers, in addition to signing in response, must also use various forms of literature and art to expose the increasingly intensified new conspiracies of the international imperialist bloc headed by US imperialism to create war in front of the broad masses of our people! The association called on national literary and art workers to launch propaganda and education work among the broad masses of the people in order to overcome the paralyzing thought of "resting easy" after only seeing the unprecedented growth of peaceful forces, as well as the confused thought of seeing the international warmongers headed by US imperialism stepping up preparations and thinking that "war is ultimately inevitable".
[This Newspaper's Report] The All-China Drama Workers Association issued a proclamation calling on national drama workers to sign the appeal from the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. The proclamation enumerated the various conspiracies of the US imperialist warmongers to undermine world peace, and explained the increasing strength of the world peace camp. Finally, it stated that the new Chinese drama workers should have the cultural task of defending world peace: exposing the conspiracies and tricks of war instigators, exposing the false pretenses and intimidation of war mongers from a scientific point of view; fighting against the ideology of US imperialism attempting to dominate the world—bourgeois worldism, and clarifying patriotic internationalism; condemning the spread of racial hatred and fascist ideology; overcoming the complacent thought that the peace camp is strong enough, and there is no need to make subjective efforts to "fight for peace", and the fatalism of "the Third World War is inevitable anyway", and smashing the reactionary ideas spread by the Chinese reactionaries that they will "stage a comeback in the Third World War".
[This Newspaper's Report] In response to the call of the Third Plenary Session of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace in Stockholm, the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has notified all branches of the Friendship Association, hoping to launch publicity activities in various ways, enthusiastically respond to the call of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, and actively mobilize members to launch a signature campaign.
