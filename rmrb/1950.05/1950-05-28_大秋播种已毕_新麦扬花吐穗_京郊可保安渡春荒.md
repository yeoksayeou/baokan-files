　　Autumn Planting Completed, New Wheat in Bloom and Heading
    Beijing Suburbs Can Safely Overcome the Spring Famine
    [Our Newspaper] Last autumn, the suburbs of Beijing suffered severe flooding. Under the leadership of the government, the disaster-stricken people overcame the famine, ensuring cultivation and achieving the goal of no one starving to death and no land being left uncultivated. Now, the autumn crops have been planted, and 330,000 mu of new wheat are in bloom and heading, and the winter-spring famine will soon be safely overcome.

    Last year's flooding caused an average reduction of 30% in the autumn harvest in the suburbs. The affected cultivated land totaled 351,740 mu, accounting for 33% of the total cultivated land in the suburbs, with the 14th and 13th districts being more severely affected. Last autumn, when the accumulated water had not receded, the district and village governments of the above two districts organized the masses to drain water and plant wheat, and led the masses to develop diversified sideline production. Coupled with the fruits of victory in the land reform and the relief grain distributed by the government, the disaster-stricken people were able to smoothly survive the severe winter. Since the beginning of spring, in addition to continuing to lead farmers in developing sideline production, the government has also used work-for-relief programs to repair water conservancy projects and highways. The masses received a total of more than 2.3 million jin of corn in wages. The government also focused on the severely affected areas, issued agricultural loans, and organized disaster-stricken people to plant early-maturing crops, overcoming the famine through production. According to incomplete statistics from the 13th and 14th districts, as of the end of March, the income from sideline production and river excavation wages totaled 2,334,340 jin of corn. Adding the 208,595 jin of corn distributed by the government as disaster relief, the total was 2,542,935 jin of corn. Together with the grain distributed during the land reform, the two districts need to assist 21,000 disaster-stricken people, and most of the rations needed for the four and a half months from before the new year to the wheat harvest have been resolved.

　　大秋播种已毕  新麦扬花吐穗
    京郊可保安渡春荒
    【本报讯】京郊去秋遭受严重涝灾，灾民在政府领导下，战胜了灾荒，保证了耕作，做到不饿死一个人不荒废一寸地；现在大秋作物播种已毕，三十三万亩新麦扬花吐穗冬歉春荒即将安然渡过。
    去年发生的涝灾，使郊区秋收平均减低三成。受灾耕地共三五一、七四○亩，占郊区耕地总面积的百分之三十三，其中十四、十三两区较为严重。去秋积水未落时，上述两区区村政府即组织群众排水种麦，领导群众开展多种副业生产；加上土地改革中的胜利果实，及政府发放的救济粮，灾民得以顺利渡过严冬。今到开春以后，政府除继续领导农民开展副业生产外，并以工代赈与修水利、公路。群众共得到工资玉米二百三十万余斤。政府又以重灾区为重点，发放了农业贷款，组织灾民播种早熟作物，从生产中克服了灾荒。据十三、十四两区不完全统计，截至三月底止，灾民副业生产和挖河工资两项，共收入玉米二、三三四、三四○斤；加上政府发放的救灾粮玉米二○八、五九五斤，共玉米二、五四二、九三五斤；连同在土地改革中分得的粮食，两区需要救助的灾民二万一千人，从年前到麦收四个半月所需口粮，已大部解决。（苏予）
