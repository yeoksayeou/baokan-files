    Just because of this, my heart fills with hatred,
    I argued with the landlord;
    A wolf biting a pig is hard to prevent,
    Why should I be made to compensate?
    The landlord's dog face is unrecognizing,
    Opening his mouth, he cursed me as a little bastard,
    Raising pigs can still be killed for meat to eat,
    What are you good for!
    Although my little pig is not big,
    It will be over a hundred catties by the New Year;
    Calculating it this way is cheap for you,
    Otherwise, the old accounts won't be clear.
    Cursing and yelling with great authority,
    A crude wooden club in his hand;
    Gritting his teeth and glaring at me,
    He came running at me, beating me all over.
    Where the wooden club struck, fresh blood flowed,
    Blue bruises and purple blood stained my clothes red;
    Crying to heaven and earth, who would care?
    I fell down in a daze.
    When I woke up, my left leg was covered in blood,
    I dragged myself, crawling back home,
    Resting and healing at home for two whole months,
    Bleeding and festering all the while.

    凯旋忆当年（三）
    西虹词  西野画
    就因这事心发恨，
    我跟地主来顶嘴；
    饿狼咬猪人难防，
    为何叫我来包赔。
    地主狗脸不认人，
    开言骂我小杂种，
    养猪还能杀肉吃，
    你有什么了不起！
    我的小猪虽不大，
    过年就是百多斤；
    这样算法便宜你，
    不然老账算不清。
    骂着叫着威风大，
    老粗木棒手中拿；
    咬牙瞪眼奔我来，
    浑身上下打不停。
    木棒起处鲜血流，
    青伤紫血染衣红；
    喊天哭地谁来理？
    昏昏沉沉倒下身。
    醒来时左腿糊上血，
    一拖一爬转家中，
    在家养伤整两月，
    又流血又流脓。    （附图片）
