Workers Increase Production, Capitalists Care for Workers
Excellent Implementation of Iron Industry Contract in Shijiazhuang

[This newspaper report] Shijiazhuang City Labor Bureau, City Federation of Trade Unions, and Federation of Industry and Commerce jointly organized an inspection team to inspect the implementation of the iron industry collective contract by 44 iron factories in the third and fourth districts. The inspection results proved that in units that truly implemented the spirit of the contract, the production efficiency of workers increased. Workers at Deyucheng increased their production of roofing tiles from more than 30 per person per day last year to more than 50. Hengxinghao used to work 15 or 16 hours a day, casting 300 pots, but now they work 11 hours a day, producing 280 pots, an average increase of 25 percent per hour. Shen Yongxing originally planned to manufacture four looms in 45 days, but completed six.

The reason these factories achieved the above results is mainly the correct implementation of the policy of developing production for the benefit of both labor and capital. While workers increased production, capitalists also appropriately took care of the workers' lives. For example, Deyucheng implemented the holiday welfare provisions in the contract, adjusted unreasonable wages, and changed meals to three meals of fine grains. In order to encourage workers' production enthusiasm, each person was given a set of clothes last year. Secondly, the past method of simply increasing working hours to increase production was corrected. Tongqingcheng launched a production competition and completed the task six days ahead of schedule, and the factory conveniently rewarded the workers with six days' wages in kind. Yongjugong stipulates that double pay is given for overtime work during holidays. Again, it is because the Party Congress, the People's Congress, and the Workers' Congress conscientiously implemented the spirit of "everything for production." In particular, the Workers' Congress further determined the principle of the trade union being oriented towards production, so that workers clearly understood that only by developing production can the interests of both labor and capital be achieved. In the months after the iron industry contract was signed, the workers' production enthusiasm greatly increased. After the contract was signed, except for individual factories that laid off workers due to reduced production, no other disputes occurred. These facts all show that a new labor-capital relationship is gradually forming.

However, there are still two biases in individual factories: one is that they do not pay attention to the problems that workers need to solve immediately and still adopt delaying methods. The other is that in factories such as Xinji, Sanxing, Zhenxing, and Xinsheng, working hours are still as long as 13 or 14 hours, and they do not try to study and improve working methods to shorten working hours, nor do they pay overtime pay.

In order to better mobilize the production enthusiasm of workers, Shen Yongxing, Tongwenxing, Tongyixing, Beida, Tianxing, and other factories have formulated supplementary contracts based on the spirit of the collective contract and the specific conditions of their factories, and formulated various reward systems to improve the old management methods and further improve production efficiency.

### 工人增加生产，资方照顾工人  石市铁业合同执行良好

　　工人增加生产，资方照顾工人
    石市铁业合同执行良好
    【本报讯】石家庄市劳动局、市总工会、工商联合会共同组织检查小组，检查三、四区四十四户铁工厂执行铁业集体合同的状况。检查结果证明：凡真正贯彻了合同精神的单位，工人的生产效率都提高了。德裕成工人生产瓦板，由去年每人每日生产三十多块增加到五十多块。恒兴号过去每天工作十五、六小时，铸三百口锅，现在每天工作十一小时，出二百八十口锅，平均每小时提高百分之二十五。沈永兴原计划四十五天制造织布机四台，结果完成了六台。
    这些工厂获得以上成绩的原因，主要是正确的执行了发展生产劳资两利的政策。工人增加了生产，资方也适当的照顾了工人的生活。如德玉成执行了合同中假期福利的规定，将不合理的工资作了调整，并将伙食改为三顿细粮。为了鼓励工人生产情绪，去年曾给每人作了一套衣服。其次是纠正了过去单纯以延长工作时间增加生产的办法。如同庆成开展了生产竞赛，提前六天完成任务，厂方便将六天工资折实奖励工人。永聚公规定假期加班发给双薪。再次是由于党代会、人代会、工代会认真贯彻一切为了生产的精神。特别是工代会更确定了工会面向生产的原则，使工人明确了只有发展生产才能达到劳资两利。在铁业合同订立后的几个月中，工人的生产情绪大大增涨，订立合同后，除个别工厂因缩小生产解雇工人外，一般的没有发生其他纠纷，这些事实都显示了一种新的劳资关系逐渐形成。
    但目前在个别工厂中，仍存有两种偏向：一是对工人需要立时解决的问题不重视，仍采取拖延的办法。另一种是鑫记、三兴、振兴、信盛等厂工时仍然长到十三、四小时，不设法研究改善工作方法，缩短工时，同时也不发加班费。
    为了更好的发挥工人的生产积极性，沈永兴、同文兴、同益兴、北大、天兴等厂已根据集体合同的精神和本厂具体情况，拟订本厂的补助合同，并制订各种奖励制度，以改善旧的管理方法，进一步提高生产效率。
