The Glory of the Boatmen of the Leizhou Peninsula
    Gu Liu, Li Qing

For decades, the people on both sides of the Qiongzhou Strait had lived a tragic, subhuman existence under the threat of imperialist gunboats and the bayonets of Kuomintang bandits. In the past six months, due to the bandit navy's "blockade" of the strait, the people on both sides had not been able to go to sea to fish. In the winter of 1949, the People's Liberation Army liberated the Leizhou Peninsula, and the people on the north bank of the Qiongzhou Strait were liberated. The boatmen, who had suffered greatly from the persecution of the bandits, became even more aware of their enemies after undergoing grievance education. On the eve of the army's oath-taking ceremony to cross the sea, the boatmen of the Leizhou Peninsula actively participated in the work of sending the army across the sea. In Nan'an Township, Xuwen, there was an old man named Liang, who was sixty years old. Both of his sons had joined the army. He had rheumatism in his legs and could not walk. When the fleet was about to depart, he insisted that his family carry him to the boat on a door panel. He said, "When it comes to the skill of steering, I'm still the best!" His family couldn't dissuade him and carried him to the shore. The PLA soldiers, seeing that he was old and had rheumatic feet, advised him to go back. He patted his chest and said, "Don't think I'm old. I'm a worm on land, but a dragon at sea! Steering doesn't require feet; my hands are still active!" The soldiers finally allowed him to board the ship and steer. Sure enough, later during the voyage, the ship he was steering did not deviate from the course at all.

On the evening of April 16th, the large army began to cross the sea. The boatman Xu Yaba steered the command ship. He sat in the wheelhouse, where the target was most visible. Enemy planes and warships were firing intensely. The commander called out to him, "Come down and take cover!" Xu Yaba didn't move. He focused on the course and moved forward bravely. The boatmen Mo Nailian and Lu Junfei from Xuwen County made a guarantee to the army on the eve of the crossing: "We are not afraid of enemy planes and warships. We will definitely deliver the army safely to Hainan Island and will not return until we reach the south bank." During the crossing on April 16th, they encountered an enemy warship halfway. Mo Nailian and Lu Junfei calmly grasped the helm, braved the hail of bullets, and safely arrived at Shiwu Port. When they returned after making a contribution, Lu Junfei said, "My wife was forcibly taken away by the Kuomintang bandits. I request to go again and give me a gun to fight the enemy."

The boatmen He Zhuoding, Deng Changhong, Deng Changshuo, Yao Shizhu, Yao Shifu, and Fu Fei had written guarantees several times, vowing to make contributions and avenge their hatred, and to send the army to Hainan regardless of any danger. During the sea crossing, their ships took the lead and bravely advanced. An enemy warship was coming from afar, and shells were constantly bombarding them. At that time, there was no wind. They vigorously rowed the oars, while loudly shouting at the enemy warship: "Damn you! Just keep firing! See how many shells you have to fill the sea." They said to the soldiers on the boat, "We guarantee a safe arrival!" The ship moved forward amidst the soldiers' heroic songs. About half a mile from the shore, the charge horn sounded, and the soldiers jumped from the cabins into the chest-deep water, carrying their guns and rushing forward. Near the beach, there was a deep pool, and more than twenty soldiers were trapped in it. The water was over their heads, and they were about to drown. Deng Changhong, Yao Shifu, Yao Shizhu, and other boatmen jumped into the water without regard for their own safety and rescued the twenty soldiers one by one. They told the soldiers to rest and gave them guns to fight the enemy. In this battle, they gloriously returned after making a major and a minor contribution. The villagers held a celebration meeting for them. The propaganda team beat gongs, drums, and performed the Yangko dance, carrying the "Glory Plaque" and "People's Hero" medals to the homes of the boatmen heroes, pinning red flowers on the chests of the people's heroes. Songs and cheers of "Top-notch!" filled the entire village.

　　雷州半岛船工们的光荣
    谷柳　里青
    几十年来，琼州海峡两岸的人民，一直在帝国主义炮舰的威胁和国民党匪帮的枪刺下，过着惨痛的非人生活。这半年来，由于匪帮海军“封锁”海峡，两岸的人民有半年没有下海捕鱼了。一九四九年冬，人民解放军解放了雷州半岛，琼州海峡北岸的人民得到了解放。饱受匪帮迫害的船工们经过诉苦教育后，更认清了自己的仇人。大军誓师渡海前夕，雷州半岛的船工们，纷纷参加了送大军渡海的工作。徐闻南安乡有个六十岁的梁老汉，他的两个儿子都参战了。他的脚有风湿病，不能走动。当航队快要出发时，他硬要家人用门板抬他到船上去。他说：“论掌舵的本领还是我到家些！”家人扭他不过，把他抬到岸边。解放军看他年老又是风湿脚，劝他回去。他拍拍胸膛说：“莫看我老，我岸上一条虫，海上一条龙！掌舵不用脚，我的手还活动！”战士终于让他上船掌舵。果然后来在航行中，他驾驶的船一分航线也没驶错。
    四月十六日傍晚，大兵团开始渡海。船工许亚八驾驶着指挥船。他坐在舵房上，目标最显。敌机敌舰枪炮密集扫射。司令员唤他：“你下来避一避！”许亚八动也不动，一心只看准航线，勇往直前。徐闻县船工莫乃连和陆君非，在渡海前夕向大军提出保证：“遇见敌机和敌舰都不怕，一定把大军安全送到海南岛，不抵南岸誓不回来。”在四月十六日渡海时，半途遭遇敌舰，莫乃连和陆君非镇定地掌握船舵，冲过枪林弹雨，安全抵达石尾港。立了功回来时，陆君非说：“我老婆被国民党匪军强抢了去，我要求再去一次，发给我枪打敌人。”
    船工何卓定、邓长鸿、邓长硕、姚世竹、姚世富、符妃三等人曾几次写保证书宣誓要立功复仇，任何危险也要把大军送到海南。渡海航行中，他们的船领先奋勇前进。远处来了敌舰，炮弹不断轰过来。当时，没有风，他们起劲地摇着橹，一面对着敌舰大声高呼：“丢那奶！尽管打炮来吧！看你有多少炮弹填海。”他们向船上的战士说：“保证安全开到！”船在战士们雄壮的歌声中前进。离海约有半里地，冲锋号响了，战士们一个个从船舱跃进深到胸部的海水，托着枪往前冲。在离沙滩很近的地方是个深潭，二十多名战士陷了进去，水过头顶，眼看就要淹没了。邓长鸿、姚世富、姚世竹等船工不顾一切跳入水中，把二十多个战士一个个救上船，他们叫战士们休息，把枪给他们去打敌人。这次战役中，他们立了一大功一小功光荣归来。村里群众为他们开庆功大会，宣传队敲着锣、打着鼓、扭着秧歌，托起“光荣牌”、“人民功臣”的奖牌往船工英雄家里送，将红花插在人民功臣的衣襟上。歌声、“顶呱呱”的欢呼声，洋溢在整个村庄里。
