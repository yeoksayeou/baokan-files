　　Special-Class Combat Hero Shi Kunjun
    Zou Lin
    Shi Kunjun is a special-class combat hero of the Southwest Jiangxi Military Region. He was born into a poor peasant family. His father died when he was three years old, and his mother passed away when he was fifteen. From that year on, he helped others hoe the fields and did odd jobs in the summer, and made cigarettes and fried dough twists in the winter to earn a little money. In 1945, he was conscripted into the army by the Kuomintang. In 1946, after being liberated in the Battle of Dushikou, he joined the revolution. Due to his high political consciousness and active work, he gloriously joined the Party in March 1947. Now he is the squad leader of the third squad of the second company.

    In the Battle of Changli in 1948, he led an assault team, under the enemy's intense fire, to assault the enemy's core position at the railway station. He rushed to the foot of the enemy's wall and threw five or six hand grenades into the gun holes, scaring the enemy out of their wits. Then he blew open one of the blocked gates and, braving the enemy's machine gun fire, rushed in one after another with another comrade. He threw a few hand grenades, suppressing the enemy's fire, and shouted loudly: "The People's Liberation Army gives preferential treatment to prisoners, those who lay down their arms will not be killed!" Thirteen enemies obediently threw their guns out of the window to surrender. At this time, more than a dozen other enemies, seeing that there were only two of them, rushed towards them. Without panic, he handed the prisoners over to another comrade and single-handedly fought the enemy with his submachine gun. Reinforcements arrived and finally annihilated this group of enemies. After the battle, he was awarded one major merit and two minor merits, and received the title of "Hero of Unparalleled Courage."

    During the Battle of Wayaogou, the first squad of the second company attacked a position, but the enemy resisted stubbornly. The first squad charged several times without success. Shi Kunjun had been promoted to squad leader of the third squad at that time. Seeing this situation, he immediately requested a mission from his superiors. The instructor, seeing that the first squad was already tired, transferred Shi Kunjun's squad up. He led his entire squad, attacking fiercely, and captured three hilltops in a row in less than an hour. He added two minor merits to the book of meritorious deeds.

    He consistently uses his own exemplary leading actions and patient persuasion to educate and reform the soldiers. Therefore, his squad has achieved significant results in troop consolidation work and mass work, and has been awarded the glorious title of "Double Good Squad." The entire squad has been awarded two major merits and two awards.

    Before heading south, his squad was supplemented by three liberated soldiers. Among them, Liu Jinyuan was unwilling to go south because his family was poor, and his mood was very low, and he even refused to eat. Comrade Shi Kunjun, in response to this point, mobilized the entire squad to send the towels, shirts, and soap issued to him to his family; and carried rice on the march, giving it to him when he was hungry, and talking to him cordially at any time to solve his ideological problems. Liu Jinyuan was finally moved. He said, "The squad leader is so good to me. I must work hard." From then on, he became an activist. Ma Yongbin, who came from a student background, was unwilling to endure hardship. While others were helping the villagers with work, he stayed home to sleep. Therefore, he had many vacancies in his work record. Comrade Shi Kunjun did the work for him and filled in the vacancies in his record. After several times, he felt embarrassed that the squad leader was so considerate of him, and he also joined the work. However, he still didn't talk and was in a bad mood all day long. Comrade Shi Kunjun discussed with the Party members and activists to elect him as the entertainment committee member and study group leader. He was consulted on everything in the squad, making him feel that he had prestige in the squad. He was praised for every achievement he made; if he had shortcomings, they were discussed with him individually. In this way, he also became active. Under his leadership, the other several ideologically backward comrades in the squad also transformed in a very short period of time.

    Their squad also did a very good job in mass work. In Beijing, the entire squad carried more than 2,000 loads of water for the villagers, and helped the villagers dig cellars for vegetables and repair toilets. The military-civilian relationship was excellent. Therefore, in addition to receiving rewards from the higher authorities, the entire squad also received one major merit and a certificate of merit. When heading south, they continued to maintain this fine tradition. At that time, he suffered from dysentery for more than a month, but he still insisted on not falling behind, and took advantage of rest or camping time to help the villagers cut wheat, carry water, carry large pots for the cooks, and take care of other sick people. Therefore, he was awarded two minor merits in Hubei. Along the way, in addition to completing the plan to fill the water tanks, their squad also constantly publicized our army's policies, so that the people in the new area had a correct understanding of our army.

    Comrade Shi Kunjun, as a hero of the people, said very modestly: "This is all the credit of the Party, the people, and all the soldiers. I myself am really not worthy."

　　特等战斗英雄史昆俊
    邹琳
    史昆俊是赣西南军区特等战斗英雄。他是贫农出身。三岁上，父亲死了；十五岁时，母亲又去世。从那年起，他夏天就帮别人刨地做零工，冬天就做香烟、麻花等小买卖。一九四五年，他被国民党抓去当兵。到一九四六年在独石口战斗中被解放后，他参加了革命。由于他政治觉悟高，工作积极，他在一九四七年三月就光荣地入了党。现在他是二连三班长。
    一九四八年昌黎战斗，他带领一个突击小组，在敌人猛烈的火力下，向车站敌人的核心阵地突击。他冲到敌人墙根下，从枪眼里丢进了五、六颗手榴弹，把敌人吓得魂不附体。于是他又把一座堵塞了的大门炸开一扇，冒着敌人的机枪扫射，奋不顾身地和另一个同志先后往里冲。他丢了几个手榴弹，把敌人的火力压住了，就大声地喊：“解放军优待俘虏，缴枪不杀！”十三个敌人乖乖地都把枪从窗眼里丢出来投降了。这时另外有十几个敌人，看见他们只有两个人，就向他们猛冲上来。他毫不慌张地把俘虏交给另一个同志，自己单身独马端起了冲锋枪和敌人干了起来。增援部队赶来，终把这股敌人消灭。战斗结束，他评上了一大功、二小功，并得了“独胆英雄”的称号。
    瓦窑沟战斗时二连一班攻一个阵地，敌人顽强抵抗。一班连冲几次，没有攻下。史昆俊那时已升任为三班长。他看见这个情况，马上向上级请求任务。指导员见一班已累了，就把史昆俊班调上去。他带领着全班，猛打猛攻，不到一个钟头就连续夺下了三个山头。功臣簿上，他添上了二小功。
    他对战士，一贯都是以自己的模范带头行动和耐心说服的方法进行教育改造。因此，他的班在部队巩固工作和群众工作中都有显著的成绩，得到了双好班的光荣称号。全班立过二大功，得过二次奖。
    南下前，他的班补充了三个解放战士。其中刘近元因为家里穷，不愿南下，情绪非常低，连饭也不吃。史昆俊同志针对着这一点，便发动全班把发下来的手巾、衬衣、肥皂送给他家里；并在行军时把饭背着，等他饿时给他吃，并且随时亲切地和他谈话，解决他的思想问题。刘近元终于被感动了。他说：“班长对我这样好。我一定要好好干。”从此他便成了积极分子。马永斌是学生出身，不愿吃苦。别人都替老乡干活去了，他就在家睡觉。因此在工作记点上他有很多缺空。史昆俊同志就代他干，替他补上了记点上的缺空。这样几次后，他感到班长这样体贴他，觉得难为情，也就参加工作。但他仍然不说话，终天闹情绪。史昆俊同志就同党员和积极分子商量选他当娱乐委员和学习组长。班上有什么事，都和他商谈，使他感觉到自己在班上有威信。他有了一点成绩就表扬他；有缺点就个别同他谈。这样，他也积极起来了。班上其他几个思想落后的同志，在他的领导下，也都在很短的时期内转变了。
    他们班上群众工作也做的很好。在北京时，全班给老乡挑了二千多担水，并且帮老乡挖菜窖、修厕所。军民关系搞得顶好。因此除受了上级的奖励外，全班还立了一大功，获得一张奖状。南下时，他们仍然一贯保持着这种优良传统。那时，他拉了一个多月的痢，但是仍然坚持不掉队，且随时利用休息或宿营时间帮助老乡割麦、挑水、替伙夫背大锅，照顾其他的病号。因此他在湖北又立上了二小功。沿途他们班除了完成水满缸的计划外，并且随时宣传我军政策，使新区老百姓对我军有正确的认识。
    史昆俊同志当了人民的功臣，他很谦虚地说：“这都是党和人民及全体战士们的功劳，我自己实在不够。”
