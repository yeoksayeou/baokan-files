　　Being a Good Master of the Country
    A Record of the District Representative Election in the 13th Police Station of the 6th District
    The district representative election of the 13th Police Station in Nanliu Lane, 6th District, was held on the evening of the 25th of this month. Voters spontaneously decorated the venue, hanging the national flag and a portrait of Chairman Mao. Representative Deng Zhishan said, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao, how could we have the honor of being representatives and serving the people?" "We must thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party with a spirit of honestly serving the people." Representatives Ma Youfang and Yang ZhanKui volunteered to write slogans. The venue became simple and solemn. Chairman Mao's colorful portrait looked particularly amiable and kind.
    The representatives included people from all walks of life. There were workers, merchants, doctors, apprentices, shopkeepers, and illiterate housewives. Street representative Huang Zhang, who lives in the Eight-Angle Glazed Well area, pointed to her son, who was not yet thirteen, whom she had specially brought, and said, "I can't write, so I asked him to write my ballot for me."
    The congress was solemnly conducted in the small courtyard of the police station. The representatives were in high spirits and carefully listened to the candidates' self-introductions. It rained during the election. Those who lived farther away also insisted on staying until the end. As a result, amidst warm applause, two representatives who were most satisfactory to the people were elected: Yang ZhanKui, who can connect with the masses, and Chen Peizhen, a housewife who is willing to work hard and bear hardships.
    Chen Peizhen said, "Chairman Mao has removed the shackles from our women, so we can be liberated and have a place. It is an honor to serve the people. If I don't do well, I hope everyone will give me more advice."
    Yang ZhanKui said, "I have lived for sixty-four years. Since the Communist Party came, Chairman Mao has led us onto the bright road. I am lucky to see the light again, and I will take on the responsibilities you have given me."
    Candidate representative Feng Liang also said in her self-introduction: "My husband died a long time ago, and I raised my sons. They joined the revolution and are Party members. I am so happy and honored to be elected as a representative..."
    At this meeting, everyone also expressed many opinions on municipal construction and sanitation work.
    The people understand that for people's lives to move towards happiness, it is necessary to "handle everyone's affairs together" and "the people work together to be good masters of the country."

　　做好国家的主人翁
    记六区十三派出所区代表选举
    六区南柳巷十三派出所的区代表选举，于本月二十五日晚举行。选民们自动地布置了会场，挂上国旗和毛主席像。代表邓芝山说：“不是毛主席，咱怎会有当代表的光荣，为人民服务呢？”“我们要以老老实实为人民服务的精神，感谢毛主席和共产党”。马有芳、杨占奎两代表自报奋勇写标语。会场变得朴素而庄严。毛主席的五彩画像，分外和蔼可亲。
    代表们包括了各阶层的人民。有工人、有商人、有医生、有学徒、有掌柜、也有不识字的家庭妇女。住八角琉璃井的街代表黄张氏指着她特地带来的不满十三岁的儿子说：“我不会写字，叫他来替我写票的。”
    大会在派出所的小院里隆重的进行。代表们精神饱满，仔细地听取候选人的自我介绍。选举途中落了雨。住得较远的也都坚持到终会。结果在热烈的掌声中，选出了两个人们最满意的代表：一是能连系群众的杨占奎，一是肯任劳任怨的家庭妇女陈佩贞。
    陈佩贞说：“毛主席解除了咱妇女们的枷锁，咱才得解放，有地位。为人民服务是光荣的。我有做不好的，还希望大家多提意见。”
    杨占奎说：“我活了六十四年了，共产党来了，毛主席把咱引上光明大道，我幸运又看见光明，我要担起你们给我的责任。”
    候选代表冯梁氏在自我介绍时也说：“我早就死去了丈夫，把儿子养大了，他们参加了革命，是党员。我又被选为代表，真高兴光荣……。”
    在这个会议上，大家还发表了许多对市政建设对清洁卫生工作的意见。
    人民是懂得：人民生活要走向幸福就必须做到“大家的事大家办”“人民齐动手做好国家的主人翁”。
