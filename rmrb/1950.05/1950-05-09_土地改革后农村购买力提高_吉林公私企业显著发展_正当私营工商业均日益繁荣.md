　　Increased Rural Purchasing Power After Land Reform
    Significant Development of Public and Private Enterprises in Jilin
    Legitimate Private Industrial and Commercial Businesses Flourishing
    [This newspaper dispatch] According to the Jilin Daily: Under the leadership of the People's Government and with the increased rural purchasing power after land reform, Jilin City's production, construction, and national economy have achieved significant development over the past year. State-owned and public enterprises have grown and strengthened, becoming the leading force in economic construction; private industrial and commercial businesses developing in directions beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood are also increasingly prosperous.

    Regarding state-owned enterprises, in May of last year, out of the city's twenty-three factories, only two had more than six hundred employees, and three had two hundred to three hundred employees. According to statistics at the end of April this year: the number of factories with more than six hundred employees has increased to six, and the number of factories with two hundred to three hundred employees has also increased to six. Last year, the city's total public and private factories and enterprises (excluding railways) employed approximately 11,000 workers, with public and private sectors each accounting for about half. This year, the total number of workers in public and private factory enterprises has increased to 20,000, with workers in public factories accounting for 14,000, nearly three times that of last year. The problem of worker unemployment has also been gradually resolved. The issue facing the government now is not how to resettle unemployed workers, but how to meet the needs of various factories and mines for workers.

    Furthermore, the number of state-owned stores in the city has increased by four compared to last year, with the number of employees increasing from 93 last year to 206 this year. The total sales revenue has increased from 24.6 billion yuan (Northeast currency, same below) to 86.6 billion yuan. In order to better adapt to the needs of the national economy, the Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau plans to add 26 state-owned stores in the second quarter of this year, striving for a capital turnover exceeding the state's regulations, reaching 6.5 times, and expanding sales volume. Additionally, as a powerful assistant to the state-owned economy, the number of cooperatives in the city has increased from only 36 last March to 45 at the end of March this year, and the number of members has also increased from over 25,000 to over 41,000.

    Private enterprises have also experienced considerable development. However, they encountered difficulties and underwent arduous efforts during the year. For example, from January to June last year, due to the continuous victories of the Liberation War, products from many major cities after liberation were continuously transported to Jilin, leading to a downturn in some local industries and handicrafts, either due to low product quality or because they were not suitable for current needs. Furthermore, the reduction in military supply and military industrial processing contributed to a bleak situation. However, under the correct leadership of the People's Government and the CCP, the policy of benefiting both labor and capital was first rectified, and collective labor-capital contracts were passed, stabilizing the business sentiments of industrialists and merchants. Furthermore, in a planned manner, based on new supply and demand conditions, they were guided to develop towards serving the countryside and the state-owned and public economy, achieving results through streamlining or reorganization. For example, compared to last year, the number of establishments in industries such as machinery, manufacturing, ironwork, textiles, matches, papermaking, chemicals, wooden farm implements, Wula (traditional winter footwear), and rawhide has increased by 11.7%, the number of workers has increased by 4.8%, and capital has increased by 12.5%. Industries that serve the countryside and meet the needs of farmers, such as porcelain, mat weaving, stationery, lime, and sack making, have generally developed. In the porcelain and mat weaving industries alone, the number of households has increased by 131.5%, capital has increased by 188%, and employees have increased by 17.7% over the past year. As for those industries that are currently not suitable for the people's needs, especially those that are not suitable for farmers' needs or are overproduced, such as grain and oil processing, tobacco, alcohol, wax, silver shops, and agency transportation, they have generally been reduced or shifted to other industries compared to last year.

　　土地改革后农村购买力提高
    吉林公私企业显著发展 
    正当私营工商业均日益繁荣
    【本报讯】据吉林日报报道：吉林市生产建设与国民经济，在人民政府领导和土地改革后农村购买力提高下，一年来已获得显著发展，国营与公营企业发展壮大，已成为经济建设中的领导力量；面向有利于国计民生方向发展的私营工商业亦日趋繁荣。
    国营企业方面，去年五月间，全市二十三个工厂中，有六百以上职工的工厂只有两家，二百人到三百人的厂有三家。到今年四月底统计：六百人以上的厂已发展到六个，二百人到三百人的厂亦发展到六个。去年全市公私营工厂企业（除铁路外）有工人约一万一千人，公私营差不多各占一半。今年公私企业工厂工人数目则已增加到两万，公营工厂工人即占一万四千人，几近去年的三倍。工人失业问题亦随着逐步得到解决，现在摆在政府面前的问题，已不是如何安置失业工人的问题，而是如何满足各厂矿企业需要工人的问题了。
    又该市国家商店比去年增加了四处，职员由去年的九十三人增加到今年的二○六人，卖钱总额由二四六亿余元（东北币、下同）增加到八六六亿余元。为了更加适应国民经济的需要，市人民政府工商局预计在今年第二季度增设国家商店二十六处，争取资金周转超过国家规定达到六·五次，并扩大卖钱额。又作为国营经济有力助手的合作社，去年三月全市只有三十六处，到今年三月底增加到四十五处，社员也由二万五千余人增加到四万一千多人。
    私营企业方面，也有了相当的发展。但在这一年中是曾经遇到一度的困难和经过一度艰巨的努力的。如去年一到六月，由于解放战争的节节胜利，解放后的许多大城市的产品不断运吉，以致本地的部分工业及手工业或因产品质量不高或因不适于当前情况需要，再加以军需、军工加工的减少，致呈现萧条景象。但经人民政府和中共的正确领导，首先端正了劳资两利政策，通过了劳资集体合同，稳定了工商业者的经营情绪；并有计划地根据新的供给与需要情况，引导其向农村及为国公营经济服务的方向发展、紧缩或改组获得了成绩，如机械、制造、铁工、纺织、火柴、造纸、化学、木农具、靰鞡、白皮等行业与去年比较，家数共增加百分之一一·七，工人增加百分之四·八，资本增加百分之一二·五；面向农村为农民需要的行业，如磁、席、文具、石灰、麻袋等营业都普遍有了发展。仅磁、席业，一年来，户数增加了百分之一三一·五，资金增加了百分之一八八，职员增加了百分之一七·七。至于那些目前还不适合于人民需要、特别是不适于农民需要或生产过剩的粮油加工、烟、酒、蜡、银楼、代理运输等业，与去年比较则已普遍缩减或转业。
