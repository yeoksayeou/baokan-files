    Construction Begins on Three Major Water Conservancy Projects in Chahar Province
    [Zhangjiakou News] According to the Chahar Daily, the surveying, design, and material preparation work for the three major water conservancy siltation projects in Chahar Province – the first siltation area of the Sanggan River, the siltation area of the Yu River, and the siltation area of the Hun River – have been basically completed. Earthwork and canal structure construction have now fully commenced. The Sanggan River is a tributary of the Yongding River, originating in Shuoxian County and flowing into the Yongding River at Zhuguantun in Zhuolu County, with a total length of 378 kilometers. The Yu River and Hun River are both tributaries of the Sanggan River. The slopes of the main and tributary rivers are very steep, so the water flow is rapid and the sand content is very high. The lower reaches are often silted up and flooded, causing great harm. Therefore, the Provincial People's Government has decided to carry out construction on the basis of the existing projects on each tributary to expand water conservancy; and to collect sand and prevent floods, reducing the effects of flooding downstream. The first siltation area of the Sanggan River diverts water from Luozhuang in Shanyin to discharge water from the Guangji Canal and the South Main Canal in Ying County; the Yu River siltation area diverts water from Gushan in the north to discharge water into the Sanggan River in the south; the Hun River siltation area diverts water from Zhenziliang in Ying County to discharge water into the Sanggan River. The three siltation areas have a total of six main and branch canals, with a total length of 274 kilometers. This project is of a large scale, requiring a total of 6,022,625 cubic meters of earthwork excavation and filling, requiring approximately 1.5 million man-days of labor. There are a total of 434 canal structures, dams, gates, bridges, culverts, aqueducts, drop structures, and sluice gates, requiring 2,228,492 kilograms of cement, 2,076,009 kilograms of lime, 10,123 cubic meters of dressed stone, 36,539 cubic meters of rubble, 18,236 cubic meters of sand, 30,744 pilings, 271,013 board feet of lumber, 22,515 kilograms of steel bars, and 45,893 kilograms of iron fittings. Many other miscellaneous materials are also required. The entire project is expected to be completed in two phases. The first phase (before the end of June) will complete all earthwork and most of the structures except for the Guangji, Hun River, and South Main Canals. The second phase will complete all earthwork and structure construction for the main and branch canals. After completion, it can irrigate 990,000 mu of land, and it is estimated that it can increase millet production by 72.9 million jin per year. It is estimated that 300,000 mu of land can be silted and irrigated that year. At the same time, it can reduce the amount of sediment and flood damage to the Yongding River downstream.
    In order to complete the three major water conservancy projects, in September of last year, the Provincial People's Government dispatched a water conservancy engineering team, together with an engineering team (18 people) sent by the Water Conservancy Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government, totaling approximately 100 people, to form three engineering teams to conduct surveying work in the three siltation areas. At that time, winter had already begun, and in order to complete the surveying task before the ground froze, the engineering team members worked diligently day and night in a spirit of tension and responsibility, braving wind and snow. They often measured barefoot in the water, and many comrades suffered frostbite on their hands and feet. Finally, all surveying was completed by the end of November. During the design phase, technical cadres often worked continuously from 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM, with many people working like this for up to twelve days. There were also people who worked while ill. By mid-March, all design, drafting, budgeting, and other work had been completed. In the awards ceremony, engineer Liu Zheng, technician Zhang Keqing, and four others won the title of surveying model.
    During the same period, all engineering offices actively carried out material preparation work. Materials such as sand, stone, bricks, and wood were all locally sourced; cement, steel, and iron were purchased from other locations through various channels. After purchase contracts were signed, inspection and transportation were organized at any time. When transporting materials, with the assistance of local Party, government, and people, animal power and vehicles were organized from the masses, and 100 vehicles organized by the Provincial Transportation Company participated in the transportation of materials, so that the materials could be delivered to the construction site in a timely manner. Moreover, the masses earned a great deal of transportation fees. By the end of March, the first siltation area of the Sanggan River and the Datong Yu River engineering area had completed 80% of all engineering materials. Except for 1,000 kilograms of rebar and miscellaneous iron parts, all materials required for the first phase of the Da Ying Guangji Water Conservancy Project have been prepared. In order to facilitate the control of the project, construction sites have been established in each siltation area to lead the construction. The troops currently participating in the earthwork project have already gone to the construction site to start work, and the structure construction has also been contracted to contractors and has already begun.

　　桑乾河·浑河·御河
    察省三大水利工程开始施工
    【张家口讯】据察哈尔日报消息：察哈尔省三大水利淤灌工程桑乾河第一淤灌区、御河淤灌区、浑河淤灌区的测量、设计、备料工作，已基本完成。土方及渠道建筑物工程，业已全面开始施工。桑乾河为永定河上游支流，源出朔县，至涿鹿县朱官屯入永定河，全长三百七十八公里。御河、浑河均为桑乾河支流。干支河流坡度很大，故水流湍急，含沙量甚大。至下游常淤积泛滥，为害甚巨。因此，该省人民政府决定在各该支流的旧有工程基础上施工，扩大水利；并收拦沙防洪，减轻下游水患之效。桑乾河第一淤灌区，由山阴的罗庄引水至应县广济渠及南干渠泄水；御河淤灌区北自孤山引水，南至桑乾河泄水；浑河淤灌区自应县镇子梁引水至桑乾河泄水。三淤灌区共计干、支渠各六道，共长二百七十四公里。此项工程规模浩大，计需挖填土方六百零二万二千六百二十五公方，约需人工一百五十多万个。渠道建筑物、水坝、闸、桥、涵、渡槽、跌水、斗门等共达四百三十四座，计需洋灰二百二十二万八千四百九十二公斤，石灰二百零七万六千零九公斤，料石一万零一百二十三公方，块石三万六千五百三十九公方，沙子一万八千二百三十六公方，桩木三万零七百四十四根，板料二十七万一千零一十三板英尺，钢筋二万二千五百一十五公斤，铁件四万五千八百九十三公斤。其他零星材料尚需很多。全部工程预计分二期完成。第一期（六月底前）除广济、浑河、南干渠外，完成全部土方工程及建筑物大部。第二期完成全部干支渠土方及建筑物工程。完成后，可灌地九十九万亩，预计每年可增产小米七千二百九十万市斤。当年预计可淤灌土地三十万亩。同时可减轻下游永定河的泥沙和洪水的灾害。
    为完成三大水利工程，去年九月间，该省人民政府即派水利工程队，会同中央人民政府农业部水利局派来的一个工程队（十八人）共约百余人，组成三个工程队，分赴三淤灌区进行测量工作。当时已进入寒冬，为争取在地冻前完成测量任务，工程队人员均以紧张负责的精神，日以继夜地冒风雪辛勤工作。常赤脚涉水测量，很多同志被冻伤手足。终于十一月底全部测量完毕。在设计时，各技术干部常从早七点直工作到夜十二点，很多人这样连续工作达十二日之久。还有带病工作的。到三月中旬，即全部完成设计、制图、预算等工作。在评奖中，工程师刘政、技工张克卿等六人荣获测量模范。
    同一时期，各工程处都积极进行备料工作。沙、石、砖、木等料均就地取材；洋灰、钢、铁等，多方从外埠采购。订立采购合同后，并能随时检查组织运输。运输工料时，因取得了地方党、政、民的协助，组织了群众的畜力车辆，另有省运输公司组织的百辆汽车参加工料运输，使工料得以应时运达工地。且使群众收入很大的脚价。三月底止，桑乾河第一淤灌区和大同御河工程区均已完成全部工程材料的百分之八十。大应广济水利工程除铁筋一千公斤及零星铁件外，第一期工程需料已全部备妥。为便于掌握工程，各淤灌区均建立了施工所领导施工。现参加土方工程的部队，已开赴工地动工，建筑物工程亦已分别由包商承包妥当，并已着手施工。
