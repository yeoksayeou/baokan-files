　　The Heroic Ninth Company
    Liu Ke Zhang Deyuan
    The Ninth Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, which had rendered meritorious service in the Siping Campaign in Northeast China, was among the first troops to land in the battle to liberate Hainan Island. After landing on April 17, the company captured the beachhead at Lingao Point in one fell swoop, wiping out a battalion of the enemy's 64th Army, and controlling a five-mile-wide coastline, allowing follow-up troops to land smoothly.
    On the evening of April 16, amid the crossing of thousands of sails, the Ninth Company's boat consistently led the way. Around three o'clock in the morning of the next day, Hainan Island was already faintly visible. The sailboat sailed to a point 300 meters from the shore, and the enemy's artillery hurriedly fired, while the heavy weapons on the boat began to fire back at the shore. Two 60mm mortars fired more than 70 rounds in nine minutes, suppressing the enemy's fire. The brave men, determined to earn merit in the landing operation, could no longer hold back. When they were still 100 meters from the shore, Second Platoon Leader Guo Yonghe jumped into the water with a "plop" and swam bravely towards the shore, pushing aside the water that covered his head. The boat roared with heroic slogans: "The opportunity to earn merit has arrived!" At this time, Squad Leader Liu Yu of the Eleventh Squad, along with a group from the Eighth Squad, also jumped into the sea. The surface of the sea was filled with the sound of soldiers splashing water and the whistling of shells.
    After breaking through the dense fire net and landing, the brave men immediately lunged forward, occupied the small hill on the right and the enemy's forward bunker on the left flank, and the entire company quickly and victoriously landed. When the Ninth Company occupied the beachhead and continued to develop on both flanks and suppress the enemy's fire, the follow-up troops crossing the Qiongzhou Strait also surged towards Lingao Point like a tide. The sound of charging horns resounded everywhere, and the night sky was interwoven with red and green signal flares.
    At this time, the remaining enemies on the left flank shrank back into a large bunker and three independent bunkers, firing wildly, blocking the coast where our army was landing. The Ninth Company Commander led the entire company to pounce on the bunker complex without hesitation. The Eleventh Squad was the first to take down the first bunker. The remaining three bunkers were also taken care of within thirty minutes. When seizing the third bunker, Squad Leader Liu Yu was wounded in the leg, but he still endured the pain to direct the fighting and continued to attack the large bunker complex. When attacking the fourth bunker, his leg was wounded again, but he still insisted on staying in the front line and encouraged other comrades to fight bravely. In the battle to eliminate the last isolated large bunker, Tenth Squad Leader Zhang Quancai's right leg, face, and waist were all seriously injured, and he could not fire a gun, but he was still shouting "Forward!" Ding Binghuai of the Fourth Squad, seeing some comrades injured and sacrificed, was so angry that his eyes turned red. Although he was also wounded in the head during the last charge, with blood streaming down his face, he still bravely rushed to the front. He finally fainted next to the bunker, still shouting, "Comrades, charge!" Machine gunner Qian Rulin was wounded, but he continued to cover the infantry's advance as usual. During the enemy's fourth counterattack, he killed nine enemies with a burst of fire. At this time, a platoon from the Eighth Company came to help, and the regiment's "August 1st" artillery also fired fiercely. The sound of charging and killing reverberated on all sides of the bunker, and the encirclement became smaller and smaller. The "August 1st" artillery blew the bunker's roof down. More than 130 enemies, enveloped in thick smoke, issued mournful cries of "Surrender," "Spare us." They crawled out from the four corners of the bunker, from the bunker door, and from the gaps blasted open by artillery shells to become prisoners.
    Standing on the top of the broken bunker, the soldiers happily watched as the powerful main force was landing from the gap on the coast of Lingao Point, and the troops filled the harbor and hills.

　　英勇的第九连
    刘克　张德源
    曾经在东北四平战役立功的人民解放军某部第九连，是这次解放海南岛战役中第一批突击登陆的部队。该连在四月十七日登陆以后，一举攻占了临高角的滩头阵地，歼敌六十四军一个营，控制了五里宽的海岸线，使得后续部队得以顺利登陆。
    四月十六日晚，在千帆齐渡中，九连的船始终领先。第二天清晨三时左右，海南岛已经隐约在望。风船驶到了离海岸三百米的地方，敌人的炮火慌忙地发射，船上的重火器也开始朝岸上还击。两门六零炮在九分钟内就打出七十多发，压倒了敌人的火力。决心要在登陆作战中争取立功的勇士们再也忍耐不住了。离岸还有一百米，二排长郭永和就扑冬一声跳下水，排开没过头顶的海水奋勇地向岸上游去。船上吼叫着雄壮的口号：“立功的机会到了！”这时，十一班班长刘玉带着八班的一个组，也跳进海中。海面上交织着战士们的拨水声和炮弹的呼啸声。
    突过密集火网登陆后的勇士们，立即向前跃进，占领了右边的小山岗和左翼敌人的前沿地堡，全连迅即全部胜利登陆。当九连占领滩头阵地续向两翼发展并压制敌人火力的时候，横渡琼州海峡的后续部队也潮水般地向临高角汹涌而来。四处响起了冲锋的号音，夜空交织着红绿色的信号光。
    这时，左翼的残敌龟缩在一个大地堡和三个独立地堡里面疯狂地射击，封锁我军登陆处的海岸。第九连连长毫不迟疑地率领全连向地堡群猛扑。十一班首先拿下第一个地堡。其余三个地堡也在三十分钟内解决。当夺取第三个地堡时，班长刘玉腿部负伤，但他仍然忍痛指挥，继续攻取大地堡群。打第四个地堡时，他的腿部又一次受伤，但还是坚持着不下火线，并鼓励其他的同志奋勇杀敌。在拔除最后的一个孤立大地堡的战斗中，十班长张全才的右腿、脸部和腰部都受了重伤，不能打枪了，他还在高喊着“前进！”四班丁炳怀看见有些同志受伤牺牲，气得眼睛发红，虽然自己在最后一次冲锋中头部也受了伤，血流满面，但他仍然奋勇冲到最前面，最后晕倒在地堡旁边，他口里还在喊着：“同志们冲啊！”机枪手钱汝林负了伤，也照常掩护步兵前进。敌人第四次反击时，他一梭子弹打死了九个敌人。这时八连的一个排前来助战，团部的“八一”炮也猛烈射击。地堡四面响彻了冲杀声，包围圈越来越小，“八一”炮把地堡盖打塌下去。一百三十多个敌人在浓烟笼罩中发出了“交枪”、“饶命”的哀鸣。他们从地堡的四角，从地堡门，从炮弹打开的缺口中钻出来当了俘虏。
    站在残缺的地堡顶上的战士们，愉快地注视着强大的主力部队正从临高角海岸缺口源源登陆，队伍布满了海港和山岗。
