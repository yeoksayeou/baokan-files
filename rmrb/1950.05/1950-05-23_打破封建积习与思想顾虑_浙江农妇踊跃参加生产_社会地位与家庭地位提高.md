　　Under the call and leadership of women's federations at all levels in Zhejiang Province, the broad masses of rural women have broken feudal habits and enthusiastically participated in agricultural labor during the spring plowing season and water conservancy projects. After the peasant movement against local bullies and for rent reduction last winter, the level of awareness of rural women in Zhejiang Province has generally increased. This spring, the People's Government called on women to participate in labor production. Women's federations in various places also convened women's representative conferences or women's production symposiums in February and March to conduct propaganda and education on labor production. As a result, the broad masses of rural women broke away from concepts such as "it's embarrassing to work" and relying on their husbands for a living, and enthusiastically participated in spring plowing and other production activities. Many farm women, with the assistance of cadres, formulated their own production plans. In the Lin'an Special District alone, more than 9,500 women have formulated production plans. They generally participated in weeding wheat, weeding rape, and reclaiming wasteland. At the same time, women in many areas have voluntarily participated in water conservancy projects. For example, women in five villages in the Chengguan District of Tangxi County repaired a 300-zhang-long section of river. Women's participation in sideline occupations is also more common than in previous years. Women in Tangxi County made 550,000 pairs of straw sandals in one month, exchanging them for more than 90,000 jin of grain. More farm women in Jiaxing, Shaoxing, Wenzhou, Lin'an and other places are raising silkworms than in previous years. Farmers in Jiaxing Special District have ordered 458,700 silkworm egg sheets. To ensure the supply of mulberry leaves, Jiaxing silkworm farmers also universally launched a mulberry locust eradication campaign. As a result of their participation in productive labor, the social and family status of rural women in Zhejiang Province has been improved compared to the past. Many women have also been elected as village and township cadres. For example, in the five newly established townships in Xindeng County, there are eight female township administrative committee members and two female township chiefs.

　　打破封建积习与思想顾虑
    浙江农妇踊跃参加生产   
    社会地位与家庭地位提高
    【新华社杭州二十一日电】浙江省的广大农村妇女，在全省各地妇女联合会的号召和领导下，打破封建积习，热烈地参加了春耕中的农业劳动和兴修水利的工程。浙江省农村妇女经过去冬反对恶霸和减租等农民运动后，觉悟程度已普遍提高。今春人民政府号召妇女参加劳动生产，各地妇联又于二、三月间纷纷召开妇女代表会或妇女生产座谈会，进行劳动生产的宣传教育，因而广大农村妇女即纷纷打破“劳动难为情”以及依赖丈夫生活等观念，踊跃参加了春耕等生产。许多农妇在干部的协助下订了自己的生产计划。仅临安专区各县订了生产计划的妇女即达九千五百余人。她们普遍参加了铲麦、铲油菜、开荒等劳动。同时，许多地区的妇女都自动参加了水利工程。如汤溪县城关区五村妇女，就修了三百丈长的河道一段。妇女参加副业亦较往年普遍。汤溪妇女在一个月内即打草鞋五十五万双，换粮九万余斤。嘉兴、绍兴、温州、临安等地农妇养蚕者亦较往年为多。嘉兴专区农户所订蚕种即达四十五万八千七百余张。为保证桑叶供给，嘉兴蚕妇并普遍发动了一次除桑蝗运动。浙江农村妇女参加生产劳动的结果，使她们的社会和家庭的地位均已较前提高，许多妇女并被选为村乡干部。如新登县新建的五个乡，就有八个女乡行政委员，两个女乡长。
