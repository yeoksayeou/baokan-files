　　The Development of Socialist Culture

　　Increased Literacy

　　“We must make all workers and all peasants cultured and educated people. We are starting to do this now.” (Stalin)

　　Tsarist Russia was a backward country. According to an 1897 survey, only 24 percent of the population over the age of nine was literate. In 1914, the number of literate people accounted for about 30 percent of the population. The Soviet state has made the fruits of culture the property of all the people. The Stalin Constitution affirmed the right of all citizens to education. Universal compulsory free primary education has been implemented in the Soviet Union. Children of all nationalities in the Soviet Union are receiving education in their own languages and have unlimited opportunities to enter any school. The struggle to eliminate illiteracy has been launched throughout the Soviet Union, considering literacy as the primary condition for mastering all the cultural wealth accumulated by mankind.

　　During the years of the Stalin Five-Year Plans, the Soviet Union achieved great success on the cultural front. According to a survey, in 1939, the percentage of literate people was 90 percent. Due to the implementation of the universal compulsory education decree, illiteracy has been further reduced, and there is no illiteracy among young people.

　　In the years since the establishment of the Soviet regime, tens of thousands of schools have been established in all the Union Republics, and hundreds of thousands of teachers have been trained. During the years of the Stalin Five-Year Plans alone, until the start of the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet Union had built 60,000 new schools.

　　During this period, the expenditure on national education exceeded 100 billion rubles. The annual allocation for national education has increased fifteen times compared to the pre-revolutionary period.

　　Number of Students in General Education Schools

　　In 1914-15, the total number of students in primary, junior high, and high schools of general education was 7.9 million, with 231,000 teachers educating them. In 1938-39, a total of 31.5 million students were studying in these schools, with 1.027 million teachers educating them. The number of students in the Central Asian and Transcaucasian republics increased particularly rapidly. In the 1938-39 academic year, compared with 1914, the number of students increased tenfold in Armenia, 43 times in Turkmenistan, 68 times in Uzbekistan, and more than 660 times in Tajikistan.

　　In 1948, there were more than 33 million students in primary, junior high, and high schools, with 1.25 million teachers educating them.

　　Secondary Education

　　In the Soviet Union, secondary schools for training specialists have been greatly expanded. If, in pre-revolutionary Russia, in 1914-15, there were 295 technical schools and other secondary schools for training specialists with 35,800 students, then in the Soviet Union, in 1938-39, there were 3,732 such schools with 951,900 students, 26.6 times more than in 1914-15. According to the 1939 survey, in the Soviet Union, 77.7 out of every 1,000 people had received secondary education.

　　In terms of the number of primary and secondary school students per thousand people, the Soviet Union surpasses all countries in the world. In 1939, the Soviet Union had 182.3 primary and secondary school students per thousand people, while the United Kingdom had 144.9, France had 135.6, Germany had 128.3, and Italy had 120.1.

　　In 1948, the number of students receiving education in various technical schools and specialized secondary schools reached more than one million.

　　Higher Education

　　Higher education in the Soviet Union is developing rapidly. In 1914, Russia had 91 institutions of higher education with 112,000 students, mainly the sons of nobles, landlords, capitalists, and high officials. In the 1939-40 academic year, the Soviet Union had 750 institutions of higher education with 619,900 students, more than five and a half times more than pre-revolutionary Russia. Higher education in the national republics developed particularly rapidly. By 1940, the number of students receiving education in Soviet institutions of higher education was greater than the number of students in 22 European countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Italy.

　　In 1948, the Soviet Union had more than 800 institutions of higher education with 730,000 students; in addition, 270,000 people were studying in institutions of higher education through correspondence courses. These figures have already exceeded the figures projected for 1950 in the post-war Five-Year Plan. If, in pre-revolutionary Russia, in 1914-15, there were a total of 5,900 professors and lecturers working in institutions of higher education, then in the Soviet Union, in 1948, there were approximately 80,000 professors and lecturers working in institutions of higher education.

　　Mass Production Education

　　In the Soviet Union, the work of training skilled young worker cadres is being widely carried out in schools established by the Labor Reserve Department. There are now more than 3,000 such schools. From 1941 to 1946, industrial schools, railway schools, and factory schools trained a total of 2.5 million young workers. Education in these schools is free. Students' food and clothing are provided by the state. Upon completion of their studies, young workers immediately have work suited to their qualifications.

　　In the Soviet Union, various refresher schools and training courses have also been widely developed. In 1938, the various training courses for training and reforming cadres alone absorbed 6.6 million people to participate in learning. In 1937 and 1938, the People's Commissariat of Agriculture and the People's Commissariat of State Farms trained more than 1.2 million ordinary agricultural cadres. Tens of thousands of workers and staff are studying without leaving production. In 1938-39, the total number of people receiving various training reached 47.4 million; that is to say, one in every four people in the Soviet Union was studying.

　　Judging only from the budgets of the entire Soviet Union and the various republics, during the implementation of the first Five-Year Plan (1928, 29 to 1932 - a total of four years and one quarter), education expenses accounted for 10.169 billion rubles; during the implementation of the second Five-Year Plan (1933 to 1937 - a total of five years), education expenses accounted for 50.4247 billion rubles. In 1940, according to the state budget alone, the total expenditure on national education was 22.7 billion rubles. In 1948, according to the state budget, the national education expenditure was 59.1 billion rubles.

　　The Development of Science

　　“Not only to catch up with, but also to surpass foreign scientific achievements in the shortest possible time.” (Stalin)

　　During the years of the Soviet regime, Soviet science has made great progress. The leading organ of the Soviet scientific community is the Soviet Academy of Sciences, a scientific organization more than twenty times larger than the Academy of Sciences in Tsarist Russia. Before the revolution, the Academy of Sciences had only 47 academicians and 212 scientific researchers. The scientific research base of the Academy of Sciences consisted of five laboratories, five museums, fourteen committees, sixteen scientific stations, and thirteen libraries.

　　In 1947, the Soviet Academy of Sciences had a total of 436 academicians and corresponding members. In addition, there were 4,350 scientific researchers and 1,050 graduate students working in the various organs of the Academy of Sciences. In 1939, the general assembly of the Academy of Sciences elected the scientific master Stalin as an honorary member of the Academy of Sciences because of his outstanding achievements in developing world science and further comprehensively developing the Marxist-Leninist doctrine.

　　In 1946, the general assembly of the Academy of Sciences elected Molotov as an honorary academician because of his outstanding achievements in developing the Marxist-Leninist science of social, state, and international relations, and because of his special achievements in the cause of Soviet state construction and consolidation.

　　In 1947, the Soviet Academy of Sciences had approximately 60 scientific research institutes in Moscow and Leningrad, 30 research institutes in various branches and research stations, as well as 16 independent laboratories with the right to use, more than 30 specialized committees, five review councils, fifteen museums, thirty-five scientific stations, seven scientific societies, and seventy-three libraries.

　　Since the establishment of the Soviet regime, academies of sciences have been established in ten Union Republics, namely, the Ukrainian Republic, the Belarusian Republic, the Georgian Republic, the Armenian Republic, the Azerbaijan Republic, the Uzbek Republic, the Kazakh Republic, the Lithuanian Republic, the Latvian Republic, and the Estonian Republic, and these academies of sciences have been working with achievements. In 1947, there were six branches in the system of the Soviet Academy of Sciences—the Kyrgyz Branch, the Tajik Branch, the Turkmen Branch, the Ural Branch, the Western Siberian Branch, and the Kazan Branch; there were nine research stations—the Komi Research Station of the Azerbaijan Republic, the Kolsk Research Station, the Far Eastern Research Station, the Karelian-Finnish Research Station, the Tajik Research Station, the Moldavian Research Station, the Sakhalin Research Station, the Crimean Research Station, the Yakutsk Research Station, and a permanent research organ in Arkhangelsk. As of July 1, 1947, these branches and research stations had a total of 30 institutes (with 166 laboratories and research departments), 51 independent research departments, one meteorological observatory, six botanical gardens, and four wildlife reserves. Tens of thousands of scientists from among the intellectual youth of all nationalities are dedicating themselves to scientific work.

　　In Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union, there are the Academy of Social Sciences and various other scientific research institutes—the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Academy of Architecture, the Academy of Medical Sciences, the Academy of Artillery Sciences, and the Academy of Pedagogical Sciences of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. In 1947, the All-Russian Academy of Arts in Leningrad was reorganized into the Soviet Academy of Arts.

　　During the years of the Soviet regime, agricultural science and medicine began to truly flourish. In Tsarist Russia, there were only 122 agricultural scientific organs in total; while in the Soviet Union, by the beginning of 1947, there were 921 agricultural scientific research organs, 1,664 breeding stations, 4,924 breeding laboratories, and 88 agricultural institutions of higher education (where scientific research work was also carried out). By the start of the Great Patriotic War, there were 213 scientific research institutes and 70 scientific laboratories in the health care system of the Soviet Union, and 72 medical research institutes. Scientific research work was also widely established in various sectors of the national economy and culture.

　　In 1947, the number of scientific workers in the Soviet Union totaled approximately 100,000. Among them, more than 10,000 were doctors and professors of science, and approximately 25,000 were masters and associate professors of science. In pre-revolutionary Russia, the total number of scientific workers was only a few thousand, and the number of doctors and professors of science was less than one thousand. In the ten years since Comrade Stalin's meeting with (1938) higher education staff in the Kremlin and his speech, the Soviet Union has carried out tremendous work in the training of scientific cadres. In higher education alone, the number of scientific workers has increased from 53,000 in 1938 to 80,000 in 1948. During this period, more than 6,000 people obtained doctorates of science, approximately 25,000 people obtained master's degrees of science, 6,000 people were approved as professors, and 21,500 people were approved as associate professors and senior scientific researchers. The massive work of training scientific cadres has also been launched in institutions of higher education and scientific research institutes. By 1948, there were approximately 13,000 scientific graduate students in the Soviet Union.

　　In Tsarist Russia, scientific thought was suppressed. Due to the conspiracy of Tsarist lackeys, the great Russian scientists N.I. Lobachevsky, K.A. Timiryazev, and A.G. Stoletov were not elected to the Academy of Sciences. Nicholas II even ordered the deprivation of Gorky's honorary academician title. Chekhov and Korolenko voluntarily renounced their honorary academician titles to protest this arbitrary act.

　　In the Soviet Union, in order to reward outstanding achievements in science, military knowledge, inventions, literature, and art, and to reward fundamental improvements in production methods, Stalin Prizes are awarded annually by the Council of Ministers. The Stalin Prize was established in commemoration of Comrade Stalin's sixtieth birthday. From 1939 to 1948, a total of 3,678 people were awarded the Stalin Prize. In the ranks of Stalin Prize winners, there are writers and Stakhanovite workers, collective farmers and actors, scholars and artists, composers and inventors. They are all talented representatives of various work sectors.

　　Soviet Publishing

　　The publication of books, magazines, and newspapers is extremely popular in the Soviet Union. In the thirty years of the Soviet regime, a total of 889,000 types of books and pamphlets have been published, with a total circulation of 11.3 billion copies, an increase of 5.6 times compared to the books and pamphlets published in Tsarist Russia during the last thirty years of Tsarist rule.

　　One of the greatest achievements of the Soviet regime is the creation of a publishing industry that prints books and periodicals in the languages of all the nationalities of the Soviet Union. In the Soviet Union, books are published in 119 languages, newspapers are published in 80 languages, and magazines are published in 56 languages. More than 40 nationalities only had their own written languages during the Soviet era. By 1947, the circulation of books published in Russian had increased nearly sevenfold compared to 1913, while the circulation of books published in the languages of other nationalities of the Soviet Union had increased twentyfold.

　　During the years of the Soviet regime, the great works of the masters of Marxist-Leninist science—Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin—have been published and circulated among the people in hundreds of millions of copies. Over the past thirty years, the total circulation of Marxist-Leninist classics has exceeded 736 million copies. This shows that the great doctrines of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin have become the doctrines of the entire people in the Soviet Union. Marx's and Engels' works have been published in 1,301 editions in various languages, with a total circulation of 39 million copies. Lenin's works have been published in 4,284 types, with a total circulation of 165.7 million copies. Stalin's works have been published in 7,079 types, with a total circulation of 520.6 million copies. The collected works of Lenin and Stalin have been published in 254 types, with a total circulation of 11.6 million copies.

　　Books about Lenin's life and career have been published in 1.143 million copies in 21 languages. Stalin's biography has been published in 3.917 million copies in 53 languages; in 1947, the revised edition was published in 3.252 million copies. In the past decade, the "Short Course of the History of the CPSU(B)" has been printed in more than 200 editions in 62 languages in the Soviet Union. At present, the total circulation of various versions of this book in the Soviet Union has exceeded 34 million copies.

　　Comrade Stalin's reports, speeches, and orders have been circulated in 113 million copies. Comrade Stalin's book "Problems of Leninism" has been published in 11 editions, printed 230 times, with a total circulation of 16.654 million copies. As for the book "On the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union," it has been published in 5 editions, printed 331 times, with a total circulation of 19.327 million copies. In 1946, the fourth edition of Lenin's Collected Works was reprinted, and the first edition of Stalin's Collected Works began to be published. The 21st volume of the fourth edition of Lenin's Collected Works and the ninth volume of Stalin's Collected Works have been published.

　　In the Soviet Union, great importance is attached to the publication of scientific works by outstanding scientists. The works of the greatest representatives of revolutionary democratic thought and the predecessors of Russian Marxism-Leninism, which had been prohibited by Tsarist Russia, have been printed in scientific editions. For the past thirty years, the works of Chernyshevsky, Belinsky, Herzen, Dobrolyubov, and Pisarev have been published in 4.045 million copies in nine languages; the works of Plekhanov have been published in 3.449 million copies in 21 languages.

　　The Soviet regime has made the classic works of natural science by M.V. Lomonosov, D.I. Mendeleev, I.I. Mechnikov, I.V. Michurin, and I.P. Pavlov and K.A. Timiryazev the property of the Soviet people.

　　In the fourteen years from 1934 to 1947, a total of 1,237,607,000 copies of textbooks for primary and secondary schools were published.

　　Great achievements have also been made in the publication of technical books, agricultural books, and scientific books. In the past thirty years, a total of 156,000 types of technical books have been published, with a total circulation of 713 million copies. In terms of the publication of technical books, the Soviet Union has surpassed all capitalist countries in the world. In these thirty years, a total of 100,200 types of agricultural books have also been published, with a total circulation of 1.164 billion copies. The number of agricultural books published in the Soviet Union in thirty years has increased by 25.8 times compared to the number published in Tsarist Russia in two hundred years. In the past ten years alone, the Soviet Union has published 46,000 types of scientific and popular science books, with a total circulation of 294 million copies.

　　In the Soviet Union, great importance is also attached to the publication of literary and artistic books. From 1928 to 1947, the Soviet Union published 70,450 types of literary and artistic books, with a total circulation of 1.3 billion copies. For example, Pushkin's works have been published in 75 languages of the Soviet nationalities in the Soviet Union for thirty years, with a total circulation of 37 million copies. This is almost three times more than the number published in Tsarist Russia in ninety years. In all the years before the revolution, the total circulation of Gorky's works was just over one million copies; but in the thirty years of the Soviet Union, a total of 45 million copies of this great Russian writer's books have been published. The works of Gogol, Lermontov, Nekrasov, Griboyedov, Shchedrin, Chekhov, and other great Russian writers and poets have also been published in millions of copies. Among the famous writers of foreign literature, those whose works have been published in the Soviet Union in 500,000 or millions of copies include Byron, Balzac, Stendhal, Bizet, Heine, Hugo, Dickens, Zola, Maupassant, Romain Rolland, Cervantes, Shakespeare, Shelley, and other writers. The average circulation of literary works was 3,400 copies in 1913, and 30,300 copies in 1947. The works of writers and poets from various Union Republics are also widely published. From 1928 to 1947, 8 billion copies of books were published in Russian and 1.9 billion copies of books were published in the languages of other nationalities of the Soviet Union. One-fifth of the books published in the languages of various national republics are literary and artistic books. In the ten years from 1938 to 1948 alone, a total of 84,292,000 copies of literary and artistic books were published in the languages of various nationalities of the Soviet Union (excluding Russian).

　　In the era of socialist construction, the most advanced Soviet literary and artistic works in the world, with the highest ideological principles, have grown up. Soviet literary and artistic works such as A. Serafimovich's "The Iron Flood," D. Furmanov's "Chapayev," A. Fadeyev's "The Rout," H. Gladkov's "Cement," H. Panfilov's "Brosky," N. Ostrovsky's "How the Steel Was Tempered," M. Sholokhov's "Quiet Flows the Don" and "Virgin Soil Upturned," A. Tolstoy's "The Road to Calvary," B. Shishkov's "Emelyan Pugachev," A. Fadeyev's "The Young Guard," B. Vasilyevskaya's "The Rainbow," B. Gorbatov's "The Unbowed," and N. Ehrenburg's "The Storm" will forever be magnificent monuments to the great era of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

　　The works of Soviet writers in 1947 accounted for more than half of the total circulation of literary and artistic books in the Soviet Union. The works of Soviet writers are also popular outside the Soviet Union. There are 33 countries that publish the works of Soviet writers.

　　On the eve of the Great Patriotic War, the Soviet Union published 8,754 types of newspapers with a total circulation of 37.5 million copies, and published 1,760 types of magazines with a total circulation of 20.02 million copies. The number of newspapers is ten times more than in 1913, and the total circulation is fourteen times more. Newspapers are published in the central areas of various provinces and districts. Many factories, manufacturing plants, railway transportation enterprises, and troops have their own publishing organs. In the Soviet Union, before the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War, newspapers were published in 80 languages. In the Tsarist era, the publication of newspapers in the languages of minority nationalities was a rare exception. In 1913, there was not even one newspaper in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, but in 1939, these two republics had 156 newspapers. The number of Belarusian newspapers has increased twelvefold during the Soviet era; in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, it has increased thirtyfold. In the Soviet Union, a huge number of wall newspapers are also published.

　　Libraries and Clubs

　　A distribution network of public libraries has been established in the Soviet Union, and its collection is constantly increasing. The total number of public libraries increased from 12,600 in 1914 to 77,600 in 1939. During the same period, the collection of books increased from 8.9 million to 146.8 million copies. In 1914, there were 0.9 libraries and 639 books per 10,000 residents, while in 1939, there were 5 public libraries and 8,612 books per the same number of residents. Along with public libraries, there is also a vast network of scientific libraries. The Lenin State Library of the Soviet Union in Moscow has more than 10 million books. The Saltykov-Shchedrin State Public Library in Leningrad had 9.4 million books in 1939. The largest libraries in the Soviet Union also include the Library of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union, the Korolenko State Scientific Library in Kharkov, the Library of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian Republic in Kiev, the Lenin State Library in Minsk, the Central Public Library in Baku, the Marx State Public Library in Tbilisi, and the State Public Libraries in Yerevan, Tashkent, Stalingrad, Almaty, Frunze, Odessa, and other cities. In 1939, the Soviet Union had 240,765 libraries, including public libraries, public libraries, scientific libraries, school libraries, and institutional libraries, with a total collection of 442.2 million copies.

　　The number of clubs has also increased greatly. In Tsarist Russia in 1914, there were 222 educational clubs (including the so-called "National Halls"). In 1939, the Soviet Union had 111,288 clubs and rural reading rooms, of which 100,852 were in rural areas. In the Soviet Union's clubs, most are cultural palaces, cultural centers, and other cultural and educational institutions that carry out multifaceted educational work and have libraries, studios, craft workshops, theaters, gymnasiums, etc. The Soviet Union has also established a very extensive museum network - artistic, historical, natural science, craft, local chronicles, etc. In 1939, there were 794 museums in the Soviet Union, compared to only 180 in 1914.

专栏：

　　社会主义文化的发展
    识字者增加
    “我们要使所有工人和所有农民，都成为有文化和有教养的人。我们现在就来作这件事情。”（斯大林）
    帝俄原是一个落后的国家。根据一八九七年的调查，全国识字者仅占九岁以上人口的百分之二十四。一九一四年，全国识字者为数约占百分之三十。苏维埃国家已使文化的成果成了全体人民的财产。斯大林宪法确认了全国一切公民享受教育的权利。在苏联已经实行了普遍的义务免费的初等教育。苏联各民族的儿童，都在受着本民族语言的教育，享有进入任何学校的无限机会。苏联全国各地，都曾展开扫除文盲的斗争，认为识字是掌握人类所积累的全部文化财产的首要条件。
    在各个斯大林五年计划的年代里，苏联在文化战线上获得了极大的成绩。根据调查，一九三九年时，识字者所占的百分比为百分之九十。由于普遍义务教育的法令的实施，文盲更加减少了，在青年中，已经没有文盲了。
    在苏维埃政权建立以来的年代里，所有加盟共和国都设立了几万所学校，培养了几十万名教员。仅仅在各个斯大林五年计划的年代里，直到卫国战争开始为止，苏联就已建立了六万所的新学校。
    这一时期内国民教育上的开支已在一千亿卢布以上。每年用于国民教育方面的拨款，较之革命前的时期增加了十五倍。
    普通教育学校的学生人数
    在一九一四到一五年，普通教育的小学、初中和高中的学生人数共为七百九十万，有二十三万一千名教员在教育他们。在一九三八到三九年，共有三千一百五十万学生在这些学校里学习，有一百另二万七千名教员在教育他们。中亚细亚和外高加索各共和国的学生人数，增加得特别迅速。在一九三八到三九的这一学年中，学生人数和一九一四年相比，在阿尔明尼亚增加了十倍，在土尔克曼增加了四十三倍，在乌兹别克增加了六十八倍，在塔吉克增加了六百六十倍以上。
    一九四八年时，小学、初中和高中共有学生三千三百万余人，有教员一百二十五万人在教育他们。
    中等教育
    在苏联，培养专家的中学有了极大的规模。如果说在革命前的俄国，在一九一四到一五年时，技术学校及培养专家的其他中学共有二百九十五所，学生三万五千八百人，那么在苏联，在一九三八到三九年，这种学校共有三千七百三十二所，学生九十五万一千九百人，比之一九一四到一五年则多了二十六点六倍。根据一九三九年的调查，在苏联，每千人中有七十七点七人是受过中等教育的。
    从每千人中的小学生和中学生的数目来看，苏联是超过世界上一切国家的。一九三九年时，苏联每千人中有中小学生一百八十二点三人，英国则是一百四十四点九人，法国是一百三十五点六人，德国是一百二十八点三人，意大利是一百二十点一人。
    一九四八年时，在各种技术学校和专科中学受教育的学生，共达一百万人以上。
    高等教育
    苏联的高等教育正在迅速地发展着。一九一四年时，俄国有高等学校九十一所，有大学生十一万二千人，大学生主要是贵族、地主、资本家、大官员的儿子。而在一九三九到一九四○年这一学年时，苏联已有高等学校七百五十所，大学生六十一万九千九百人，比革命前的俄国多了五倍半。各民族共和国的高等教育，发展得特别急速。到一九四○年，在苏联高等学校中受教育的大学生人数，比之欧洲二十二国的大学生人数还多，所说的欧洲国家，包括英国、法国、德国、意大利。
    在一九四八年，苏联有高等学校八百余所，大学生七十三万人；此外，还有二十七万人用函授方法在高等学校中学习。这些数字已经超过了战后五年计划为一九五○年所预定的数字。如果说，在革命前的俄国，一九一四到一五年时，共有教授和讲师五千九百人在高等学校中工作，那么在苏联，一九四八年时，已共有教授和讲师约八万人在高等学校里工作了。
    群众生产教育
    在苏联，培养熟练青年工人干部的工作，正在劳动后备部所设立的学校中广泛地进行着，这种学校现在已有三千所以上。从一九四一年到一九四六年，工业学校、铁路学校及工厂学校，共培养了二百五十万青年工人。在这些学校中受教育是免费的。学生的伙食及服装，由国家供给。学习一完毕，青年工人便立即有适合其资格的工作做。
    在苏联，各种补习学校和训练班，也有广泛的发展。一九三八年时，仅仅培养和改造干部的各种训练班，就吸收了六百六十万人参加学习。一九三七年和一九三八年，农业人民委员会及国营农场人民委员会曾培养了普通农业干部一百二十万人以上。成十万工人和职员，正在学习而不脱离生产。在一九三八到三九年，受各种训练的人员总数，达四千七百四十万；这就是说，苏联每四个人当中就有一个人在学习。
    仅就全苏联及各共和国的预算来看，在实行第一个五年计划时（一九二八、二九年到一九三二年——共四年又一季），教育经费就占一百零一亿又六百九十万卢布；在实行第二个五年计划时（一九三三年到一九三七年——共五年），教育经费则占五百零四亿二千四百七十万卢布。一九四○年时，仅根据国家预算，国民教育的经费总共支出了二百二十七亿卢布。一九四八年时，根据国家预算，全国的教育经费为五百九十一亿卢布。
    科学的发展
    “不仅仅要赶上，而且要在最短期间超过外国的科学成就。”（斯大林）
    在苏维埃政权的年代里，苏联科学已有了长足的发展。苏联科学界的领导机关，是苏联科学院，这是一个比帝俄时代的科学院扩大了二十多倍的科学团体。革命前，科学院仅有四十七个院士和二百一十二个科学研究员。科学院的科学研究基础，是由五个实验室，五个博物馆，十四个委员会，十六个科学站和十三个图书馆所组成的。
    一九四七年，苏联科学院共有院士及通讯会员四百三十六人。另有科学研究员四千三百五十人及研究生一千零五十人，在科学院的各机关工作。一九三九年，科学院全体大会选举科学大师斯大林为科学院荣誉会员，这是因为他在发展世界科学及进一步全面地发展马列主义学说方面有了卓越的功绩。
    一九四六年，科学院全体大会选举莫洛托夫为荣誉院士，因为他在发展马克思——列宁关于社会、国家及国际关系的科学方面有了卓越的功绩，又因为他在苏维埃国家建设和巩固的事业上有了特殊的功绩。
    一九四七年，苏联科学院在莫斯科和列宁格勒共有科学研究所约六十处，在各分院及研究站共有研究所三十处，此外尚有十六个研究所有权使用的独立实验室，三十余个专门委员会，五个评议会，十五个博物馆，三十五个科学站，七个科学社，七十三个图书馆。
    自苏维埃政权建立以来，在十个加盟共和国中，就是说在乌克兰共和国、白俄罗斯共和国、格鲁吉亚共和国、阿尔明尼亚共和国、阿捷尔拜疆共和国、乌兹别克共和国、卡萨赫共和国、立陶宛共和国、拉脱维亚共和国和爱沙尼亚共和国中，都建立了科学院，这些科学院并且工作得有成绩。一九四七年，在苏联科学院的系统中共有六个分院——吉尔吉兹分院、塔吉克分院、土尔克曼分院、乌拉尔分院、西伯利亚西部分院及喀山分院；共有九个研究站——阿捷尔拜疆共和国的科米研究站，科尔斯克研究站，远东研究站，卡累利亚·芬兰研究站，塔吉克研究站，莫尔达维亚研究站，库页岛研究站，克里姆研究站，雅库茨克研究站及一个在阿尔汗格利的常设研究机关。截至一九四七年七月一日为止，这些分院和研究站共有三十个研究所（附有一百六十六个实验室及研究部），五十一个独立研究部门，一个气象台，六个植物园和四个禁猎区。各民族的知识青年中，有成万个科学家，正在致力于科学工作。
    在苏联首都莫斯科，设有社会科学研究院及其他各种科学研究院——全苏列宁农业科学院、建筑学研究院、医学研究院、炮兵学研究院、苏俄教育学研究院。一九四七年，列宁格勒的全俄艺术研究院改组为苏联艺术研究院。
    在苏维埃政权的年代中，农业科学和医学开始有了真正的繁荣。在帝俄，总共只有一百二十二个农业科学机关；而在苏联，到一九四七年初为止，就已有了九百二十一个农业科学研究机关，一千六百六十四个选种站，四千九百二十四个选种实验室，八十八所农业高等学校（学校里也进行科学研究工作）。到伟大卫国战争开始时，在苏联的保健事业系统中已有二百一十三个科学研究所，七十个科学实验室，七十二个医学研究所。在国民经济和文化的各部门中也都广泛地设有科学研究工作。
    一九四七年，联苏的科学工作者为数共约十万人。其中有一万余人为科学博士和教授，约二万五千人为科学硕士和副教授。在革命前的俄国，科学工作者总共不过几千人，而科学博士和教授，则不足一千人。在斯大林同志于克里姆林宫接见（一九三八年）高等学校工作人员发表谈话后的这十年中间，苏联曾在科学干部的培养上进行了巨大的工作。仅仅在高等学校中，科学工作者的数目已从一九三八年的五万三千人增至一九四八年的八万人。在这一时期中，六千余人获得了科学博士的学位，约二万五千人获得了科学硕士的学位，六千人被批准为教授，二万一千五百人被批准为副教授及高级科学研究员。培养科学干部的巨大工作，在高等学校和科学研究所中也展开起来了。到一九四八年为止，苏联全国共有科学研究生一万三千人左右。
    在帝俄，科学思想是被压制的。由于沙皇走狗的阴谋，伟大的俄国科学家Ｈ·И，罗巴契夫斯基、Ｋ·Ａ·季米略杰夫、Ａ·Г·斯托列托夫，都没有被选入科学院。尼古拉二世并曾下令剥夺了高尔基的名誉院士的称号。柴霍甫和柯罗连科为了对这一专横手段表示抗议，曾自动放弃了自己名誉院士的称号。
    在苏联，为了奖励科学、军事知识、发明、文学和艺术各方面的卓越成绩，以及为了奖励生产方法的根本改进，每年都由部长会议颁发斯大林奖金。斯大林奖金是为纪念斯大林同志的六十寿辰而创立的。从一九三九年到一九四八年，共有三千六百七十八人荣获了斯大林奖金。在斯大林奖金得奖者的队伍中，有作家和斯达哈诺夫工作者，有集体农民和演员，有学者和艺术家，有作曲家和发明家。他们都是各种工作部门中富有天才的代表人物。
    苏联的出版事业
    书籍、杂志和报纸的出版，在苏联是极普及的。在苏维埃政权的三十年间，总共出版了八十八万九千种书籍和小册子，发行总额为一百一十三亿册，比沙皇统治的最后三十年内帝俄所出版的书籍和小册子增加了五点六倍。
    苏维埃政权最伟大的成果之一，乃是创立了用苏联各族文字印刷书刊的出版事业。在苏联，书籍用一百一十九种文字出版，报纸用八十种文字出版，杂志用五十六种文字出版。有四十余个民族，只是在苏维埃政权时代才有了本族的文字。到一九四七年，用俄文出版的书籍，比之一九一三年在发行总额上增加了将近七倍，而用苏联其他各族文字出版的书籍，则增加了二十倍。
    在苏维埃政权的年代里，马列主义科学大师——马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林——的伟大著作，成亿册地出版后流传在人民中。三十年来，马列主义经典著作的发行总额，超过了七亿三千六百万册。这说明：马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的伟大学说，在苏联已经成了全体人民的学说。马克思、恩格斯的著作，用各种文字出版了一千三百零一版，发行总额为三千九百万册。列宁的著作出版了四千二百八十四种，发行总额为一亿六千五百七十万册。斯大林的著作出版了七千零七十九种，发行总额为五亿二千零六十万册。列宁和斯大林的文集出版了二百五十四种，发行总额为一千一百六十万册。
    关于列宁的生平和事业的书籍，用二十一种文字发行了一百一十四万三千册。斯大林传略，用五十三种文字发行了三百九十一万七千册；一九四七年时，增订版发行了三百二十五万二千册。近十年来，《联共党史简明教程》一书，在苏联用六十二种文字印行了二百多版。目前该书在苏联各种版本的发行总额上已经超过了三千四百万册。
    斯大林同志的报告、演说和命令，共发行了一亿一千三百万册。斯大林同志所著《列宁主义问题》一书，共出十一版，印行二百三十次，发行总额为一千六百六十五万四千册。至于《论苏联的伟大卫国战争》一书，共出五版，印行三百三十一次，发行总额为一千九百三十二万七千册。一九四六年，重新印行了列宁文集的第四版，开始出版了斯大林文集的初版。列宁文集第四版第二十一卷和斯大林文集第九卷都已问世了。
    在苏联，对于印行杰出科学家的科学著作，是极为重视的。那些曾为帝俄所禁止的、最伟大的革命民主思想的代表者、俄国马克思——列宁主义先辈的著作，都已印成了科学版本。三十年来，车尔耐舍夫斯基、白林斯基、赫尔岑、杜勃罗留鲍夫、比萨列夫等的著作，用九种文字发行了四百零四万五千册；普列哈诺夫的著作，用二十一种文字出版了三百四十四万九千册。
    苏维埃政权竟使Ｍ·Ｂ·罗蒙诺索夫，Д·И·明杰烈耶夫，И·И·契尼科夫，И·Ｂ·米邱林，И·密·巴甫洛夫，Ｋ·Ａ·季米略杰夫等人的自然科学经典著作，都成了苏联人民的财产。
    从一九三四年到一九四七年的十四年内，小学及中学的教科书总共出版了十二亿三千七百六十万零七千册。
    在出版技术书籍、农业书籍和科学书籍方面，也获得了极大的成绩。最近三十年间，共出版了十五万六千种技术书籍，发行总额为七亿一千三百万册。就技术书籍的出版来说，苏联已经超过了世界上一切资本主义国家。在这三十年内，还共出版了十万零二千种农业书籍，发行总额为十一亿六千四百万册。三十年间在苏联出版的农业书籍，与帝俄两百年间所出版的相比，共增加了二十五点八倍。仅在最近十年之内，苏联就出版了四万六千种科学和通俗科学书籍，发行总额为二亿九千四百万册。
    在苏联，对于文艺书籍的出版，也极其重视。从一九二八年到一九四七年，苏联出版了七万零四百五十种文艺书籍，发行总额为十三亿册。例如普希金的作品，三十年间，在苏联以七十五种苏联各族文字出版着，发行总额为三千七百万册。这比帝俄九十年间所出版的数量，几乎还多三倍。在革命前的所有年份里，高尔基作品的发行总额为一百万册稍强；但是在苏联三十年间，就共出版了这个伟大俄罗斯作家的书籍四千五百万册。戈果里、莱蒙托夫、涅克拉索夫、格里波也多夫、谢德林、柴霍夫及其他伟大俄罗斯作家和诗人的作品，也都成百万册地出版着。在外国文学的著名作家中，其作品在苏联以成五十万册或成百万册出版的，则有拜伦，巴尔扎克，斯坦达巴尔，比塞，海涅，雨果，迭更斯，左拉，莫泊桑，罗曼·罗兰，西万提斯，莎士比亚，雪莱及其他作家。文艺作品的平均发行额，在一九一三年为三千四百册，而在一九四七年则为三万另三百册。各加盟共和国的作家和诗人的作品，也被广泛地出版着。从一九二八年到一九四七年，在苏联，用俄文出版了八十亿册书籍，用苏联其他民族文字出版了十九亿册书籍。用各民族共和国文字出版的书籍中，有五分之一是文艺书籍。仅仅在一九三八年到一九四八年的，十年间，用苏联各族文字（俄文除外）出版的文艺书籍，总共达八千四百二十九万二千册。
    在社会主义建设的年代里，世界上最先进的、思想原则最高度的苏维埃文艺作品成长起来了。像Ａ·绥拉菲莫维奇的《铁流》，Д·富尔曼诺夫的《夏伯阳》，Ａ·法捷耶夫的《毁灭》，Х·格拉德科夫的《士敏土》，Х·潘菲洛夫的《布罗斯基》，Ｈ·奥斯特洛夫斯基的《钢铁是怎样炼成的》，Ｍ·萧洛霍夫的《静静的顿河》与《被开垦的处女地》，Ａ·托尔斯泰的《苦难的历程》，Ｂ·石西科夫的《叶密力扬·布格巧夫》，Ａ·法捷耶夫的《青年近卫军》，Ｂ·华西列夫斯卡娅的《虹》，Б·哥尔巴托夫的《不屈的人们》，Ｎ·爱伦堡的《暴风雨》等的苏维埃文艺作品，都将永远成为社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大时代的辉煌纪念碑。
    苏联作家在一九四七年的作品，占苏联的文艺书籍发行总额的半数以上。苏联作家的作品，在苏联国外也很流行。出版苏联作家作品的国家，共有三十三个。
    在伟大卫国战争前夕，苏联出版了八千七百五十四种报纸，发行总额为三千七百五十万份，并且出版了一千七百六十种杂志，发行总额为二千零二十万份。报纸种数比一九一三年多十倍，发行总额则多十四倍。在各州和各区的中心地，都有报纸出版。许多工厂、制造厂、铁道运输企业、部队，都有自己的出版机关。在苏联，在伟大卫国战争爆发以前，报纸是用八十种文字出版的。而在帝俄时代，用少数民族的文字出版报纸，乃是稀有的例外。一九一三年，在吉尔吉兹和塔吉克都连一种报纸也没有，而在一九三九年，这两个共和国却已都有了一百五十六种报纸。白俄罗斯报纸的种数，在苏维埃政权时期，增加了十二倍；在卡萨克和土尔克曼，则增加了三十倍。在苏联，还出版着巨量的墙报。
    图书馆与俱乐部
    大众图书馆的分布网在苏联已经建立起来，其藏书正在不断增加着。大众图书馆总数在一九一四年时为一万二千六百所，一九三九年时增加到七万七千六百所，同时期内，藏书亦自八百九十万册增至一万四千六百八十万册。一九一四年时，每一万居民中有零点九所图书馆与六三九册图书，而于一九三九年，在同一数字的居民中，则有五所大众图书馆与八千六百十二册图书。与大众图书馆一起，并有广大的科学图书馆网。莫斯科的苏联国立列宁图书馆共计有图书一千万册以上。列宁格勒的国立谢德林公共图书馆于一九三九年有图书九百四十万册，苏联最大的图书馆中并有：苏联科学院图书馆，哈里可夫的国立柯罗连科科学图书馆，基辅的乌克兰共和国科学院图书馆，明斯克的国立列宁图书馆，巴库的中央公共图书馆，梯比里斯的国立马克思公共图书馆，叶里凡、塔什干、斯大林格勒、阿拉木图、伏龙兹、敖德萨及其他城市的国立公共图书馆。一九三九年苏联共有图书馆二十四万又七百六十五所，其中包括大众图书馆、公共图书馆、科学图书馆、学校图书馆、机关图书馆等，藏书共有四亿四千二百二十万册。
    俱乐部增加亦极大。一九一四年帝俄时有二百二十二所教育俱乐部（包括所谓“国民馆”）。一九三九年苏联设有十一万一千二百八十八所俱乐部与农村读书屋，其中，十万另一千八百五十二所在乡村。在苏联的俱乐部中，多数是文化宫、文化馆与其他进行多方面教育工作，且设有图书室、画室、工艺场、戏院、体育馆等等的文化教育机关。苏联并建立范围极广的博物馆网——有艺术的、历史的、自然科学的、工艺品的、地方志的等等。一九三九年苏联国内共有博物馆七百九十四座，一九一四年则只有一百八十座。
