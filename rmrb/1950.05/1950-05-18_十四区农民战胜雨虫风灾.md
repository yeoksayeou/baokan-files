    Since the villages in the Fourteenth District held farmer representative meetings, the farmers' enthusiasm for production has increased even more. Villages such as Huaifang, Yinghaizhuang, Yilezhuang, and Shibalidian have all made village-wide production increase plans. Many cadres, party members, and farmers have also made their own production increase plans from various aspects such as increasing fertilizer, digging wells, reclaiming submerged land, and planting cotton. Farmers are all involved in the upsurge of increasing production. But at this time, they suffered a series of rain, insect, and wind disasters.

    After the rain on April 15th and 16th, many villages suffered from rain disasters. In the Xihongmen village area, more than 4,000 mu of land were flooded, some of which had already been sown, and more than 80 ridges of sweet potato seedlings were also collapsed by the rain. More than 100 warm beds in Xinguang village were collapsed by the rain. Many rice seedlings raised in Majiapu were damaged by the water. More than 100 mu of wheat fields in Yinghaizhuang were also flooded. Many houses collapsed in various villages. According to statistics from six villages including Sihaizhuang, a total of 466 rooms collapsed. After the rain, the work team and village cadres immediately went to each household to express condolences and arrange resettlement, and mobilized the masses to help each other to solve the difficulties in housing and construction. Deputy District Chief Yan Chengxiang personally went to Xihongmen to inspect and organized the masses to clean up the disaster-stricken land and the sweet potato warm beds damaged by the rain. Under the leadership of the government, Xinkailu village repaired more than 40 houses on the third day after the rain. Various villages also repaired them one after another. The loss of Xihongmen's sweet potato ridges and Xinguang's warm beds was not significant after the rescue.

    Around April 27th, wheat leaf bee larvae were found in the wheat fields of Yilezhuang and other villages. In Yilezhuang, Nanxiaojie, Yinghaizhuang, and Xiyanwo four villages, 79 mu of land were heavily affected, and 294 mu were lightly affected.

    After the insect infestation was discovered, Deputy District Chief of the District Government Yan Chengxiang and Director of the District Farmers' Association Niu Xiaoqing immediately went to Yilezhuang to inspect, mobilize and organize the masses to catch and kill the insects, and notified the villages to carefully check and report and eliminate them in time after they were found. After Xiyanwo discovered it on the morning of the 27th, the work team and village cadres immediately convened a meeting of farmer representatives to conduct on-site inspections and study methods for catching and killing the insects. That night, 374 farmers were mobilized to catch and kill the insects overnight. Yilezhuang and Yinghaizhuang also immediately organized the masses to catch and kill the insects after using cotton pesticide to kill the insects failed. Due to timely discovery and timely capture and killing, a total of 103 jin were captured and killed in three days, eliminating the insect infestation.

    When the farmers were rushing to plant cotton and sweet potatoes, it rained again on May 1st. This added new difficulties to planting in low-lying areas. The cotton that had been planted was not easy to sprout due to the soil crusting after the rain. The seeds that had not been sown could not be planted due to the wet ground, and there was a risk of spoilage. The work team gathered experienced farmers and cadres in villages such as Yinghaizhuang and Sihaizhuang to study emergency measures. For the land that had been sown, farmers were mobilized to loosen the soil on the cotton ridges with three-toothed rakes so that the seedlings could emerge from the ground. Sihaizhuang raked more than 900 mu in two days. Now all the cotton fields in various villages that have been crusted by rain have been raked. Some cotton seedlings have emerged by 50% to 60%. According to farmers' estimates, 80% of the cotton seedlings may emerge this year, and they are preparing to replant. After research on the soaked cotton seeds, it was decided to first plow the land prepared for planting cotton to make the land dry quickly. At the same time, the cotton seeds should be immediately replaced with cold water and the water should be changed frequently. Now the land has been dried, and the cotton seeds have not been damaged, and planting has begun to continue.

    Xinguang, Xihongmen, Huaifang and other villages are close to the sand wind outlet of the Haizi Wall and are often plagued by wind disasters. The strong winds on May 6th and 7th this year caused great damage to wheat, sweet potatoes, peanuts, millet, etc. in the above-mentioned villages. In Xinguang village, 95 mu of wheat and 59.5 mu of sweet potatoes were blown away and killed by sand. Peanuts, millet, beans, etc. were badly damaged and covered by sand. More than 207 mu of land in Xinguang village was affected. Huaifang Xihongmen also suffered more than 30 mu. The work team and village cadres mobilized the masses, and now they have all replanted or are preparing to replant. For households without seeds, farmers in the village will help each other or find a solution from the fruits of land reform. Party member Huang Zengjiang replanted four mu after four mu of sweet potatoes were blown away. He said: "This little wind disaster can't stop us from increasing production!"

    The farmers have overcome the difficulties in production, defeated several disasters, and their confidence in increasing production by 10% has become increasingly firm. At present, the work of increasing fertilizer application and sowing cotton and sweet potatoes has been largely completed. Great achievements have also been made in expanding paddy fields. Yinghaizhuang has always only planted 1,100 mu of cotton, but this year it has planted more than 2,420 mu. All villages have also planted more cotton than in previous years. At the same time, because the Fenghe and Lianghe dredging projects have been completed, more than 100,000 mu of land on both sides have been protected from flooding, which is a powerful guarantee for increasing production by 10%.

　　十四区农民战胜雨虫风灾
　　赵有福
    京郊十四区自各村开了农民代表会以后，农民的生产劲头更加大了。槐房、瀛海庄、怡乐庄、十八里店等村，都作出了全村的增产计划。有很多干部、党员、农民也从增肥、打井、开水地、种棉花等多方面作出了自己的增产计划。农民都卷入了增产热潮里。但就在这时，却遭到了一连串的雨、虫、风灾。
    四月十五、六两日雨后，不少村都遭了雨灾。西红门村一带有四千多亩土地被淹，其中有的已播了种，八十多炕白薯苗也被雨浇塌。新宫村的一百多间暖床被雨浇塌。马家堡养的稻苗，不少被水冲坏。瀛海庄有百余亩麦地也上了水。各村倒塌房屋很多。据四海庄等六个村的统计，共倒塌了四百六十六间。雨后，工作组及村干部立即分头到各户慰问安置，发动群众互助，解决住处及修建上的困难。副区长阎呈祥，亲自到西红门查看，并组织群众收拾被灾的土地，及被雨浇坏的白薯暖床。在政府领导下，新开路村在雨后的第三天，便修好四十多间房屋。各村也相继修好。西红门白薯炕及新宫的暖床，经过挽救，损失也不大。
    四月二十七前后，怡乐庄等村又在麦地里发现麦叶蜂幼虫为害。怡乐庄、南小街、瀛海庄、西燕窝四村，有七十九亩地较重，轻的共有二百九十四亩。
    发现虫害后，区政府副区长阎呈祥、区农会主任牛小庆立即到怡乐庄查看，动员组织群众捕打，并通知各村认真检查，发现后应及时报告与扑灭。西燕窝于二十七日上午发现后，工作组村干部马上召开了农民代表会议，就地检查及研究捕打办法。当晚发动了农民三百七十四人，连夜捕打。怡乐庄、瀛海庄，经用棉花药水杀虫无效，也马上组织群众捕打。由于发现及时，捕打及时，三天共捕打了一百零三斤，消灭了虫害。
    农民正在突击种棉花、栽白薯的时候，五月一日又下了一场雨。这给洼地播种加添了新的困难。已种上的棉花，因雨后地皮结痂，不易出芽，没有播种的，浸了的种子因地湿不能种，有坏掉的危险。工作组在瀛海庄、四海庄等村召集了有经验的农民及干部，研究出急救办法。对已播种的地，发动农民用三齿搂棉花垄，把土搂松，幼芽就能钻出地面了。四海庄两天搂了九百多亩。现在各村被雨浇而结痂的棉田，已全部搂完。有的棉苗已出了五、六成。据农民估计：今年棉苗可能出八成，他们正准备补苗。对浸种的棉籽，经研究后，决定先将准备种棉的地耠开，使土地快干。同时将棉籽马上换成冷水泡上，并常换水。现在地已晾干，棉籽也没有坏，已开始继续播种。
    新宫、西红门、槐房等村，因靠近海子墙的沙风口，常年都闹风灾。今年五月六、七两日大风，使上述村庄的麦子、白薯、花生、谷子等都受害很大。新宫村九十五亩小麦，五十九亩半白薯，都被风刮、沙打死去。花生、谷子、豆类等，被刮坏及沙土压坏很多。新宫村受灾土地二百零七亩多。槐房西红门也受灾三十多亩。工作组、村干部动员，群众现在都已经或准备重种。对没有籽种的户，由村中农民互助或从土地改革胜利果实中想法解决。党员黄增江，四亩白薯被刮坏后又栽了四亩。他说：“这点风灾挡不住咱们增产！”
    农民克服了生产中的困难，战胜了几次灾害，增产一成的信心益形坚定。现在，增施肥料及播种棉花、白薯等工作已大部完成。扩大水田也有了很大成绩。瀛海庄常年只种一千一百亩棉花，今年种了二千四百二十多亩。各村种棉也都超过往年。同时因为凤河、凉河疏浚工程已经完成，使两岸十万余亩土地免受涝灾，对增产一成更是一个有力保证。保证。
