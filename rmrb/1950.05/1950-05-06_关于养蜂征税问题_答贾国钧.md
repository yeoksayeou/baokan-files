　　On the Issue of Taxation on Beekeeping
    A Response to Jia Guojun

To the Editor Comrade Jia Guojun:

    I am from Xinle County, and there are many beekeepers in Xinle. This year, beekeepers have some concerns: most are afraid to expand their operations significantly, fearing they cannot afford the tax if they exceed ten hives (Xinle County stipulates taxation for those exceeding ten hives), and fearing arbitrary collection by cadres. This inadvertently hinders the development of the beekeeping industry. I have the following opinions on this issue:

    (1) If specific regulations for bee taxation have not yet been formulated, they should be drafted and announced as soon as possible to alleviate the concerns of beekeepers, encourage them to expand beekeeping operations, thereby increasing national income and improving people's lives.

    (2) Taxing by the hive is not very appropriate. The size of the hive, the strength of the bee colony, and the abundance of each year all vary greatly. Taxing based on income is more reasonable.

    (3) Since the government advocates the development of sideline occupations, it should pay attention to solving the problem of honey sales. Trade companies can purchase honey at reasonable prices.

To Jia Guojun:

    Regarding the several issues of beekeeping taxation, we have requested answers from the State Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance as follows:

    1. Specific regulations are not made specifically for beekeeping taxation. The taxation standard is handled in accordance with the Industrial and Commercial Tax Regulations. Article 5, Section 2 of the regulations stipulates: Family sideline occupations are exempt from taxation. If farmers use their spare time to raise a few hives of bees to supplement their family life, and their income does not exceed one-half of their primary occupation, it is treated as a sideline occupation and is not taxed. If their income exceeds one-half of their primary occupation, it will be taxed according to the Industrial and Commercial Tax Regulations. This is a principle regulation, and local areas can make further determinations based on specific circumstances. Xinle County's regulation of taxing those exceeding ten hives is based on the above principles and in reference to the actual situation.

    2. Beekeeping taxation is not a tax on bees, nor is it levied on a per-hive basis. It is calculated and levied based on the income of beekeepers from selling bees, honey, and beeswax. The Xinle County regulation of taxing those exceeding ten hives means that those with fewer than ten hives are certainly considered family sideline occupations, and those exceeding ten hives should be taxed separately according to the business and income listed in the appendix to the Industrial and Commercial Tax Regulations. However, the regulation of ten hives is not a threshold. Even those with fewer than ten hives must be included in the calculation.

    3. Article 1 of the Industrial and Commercial Tax Regulations stipulates that industrial and commercial enterprises with the purpose of profit are subject to industrial and commercial tax. The sale of bees, honey, and beeswax by beekeepers constitutes a commercial activity and should therefore be taxed.

    The government advocates the development of production, but commercial income exceeding the scope of sideline occupations should be taxed. Paying taxes is a glorious duty of the people. Those with income should contribute some burden. At the same time, the tax rate is not high and should not prevent the expansion of production due to taxation.

### 关于养蜂征税问题  答贾国钧

　　关于养蜂征税问题
    答贾国钧编辑同志：
    我是新乐县人，新乐养蜂的人是很多的。今年养蜂的人有些顾虑：多半不敢大量扩充，怕超过十箱纳不起税（新乐县规定超过十箱纳税），怕干部乱征。这样一来，就无形中妨碍了蜂业的发展。对这个问题我有如下意见：
    （一）如蜂税还未作具体规定，应赶紧制定公布，解除养蜂者的思想顾虑，大量扩充养蜂，以利增加国家收入，改善人民生活。
    （二）按箱征税是不大合适的。箱的大小，蜂群的强弱以及每年的丰歉，都出入很大。以收入来征税较合理。
    （三）政府既提倡人民发展副业，应注意解决蜂蜜的销路问题。贸易公司可以合理的价格收购。
     农大  贾国钧贾国钧君：
    关于养蜂征税的几个问题，经请财政部税务总局解答如下：
    一、养蜂征税不专作具体规定，征税标准是依照工商业税条例办理。条例第五条二项规定：家庭副业免征。农民利用农闲养几房蜂以其收益补助家庭生活，其收入不超过主业二分之一者，即作为副业处理，这样是不征税的。其收入如果超过主业二分之一以上，即按工商业条例来征税。这是一个原则的规定，各地可根据具体情况再作确定。新乐县规定超过十箱就纳税，这就是依照上述原则参照实际情况而规定的。
    二、养蜂征税不是征蜂的税，亦不是按箱计征，是按养蜂者出售蜜蜂、蜂蜜、蜂腊的收入计算征收的。新乐县规定的超过十箱征税，就是十箱以下的肯定作为家庭副业，超过十箱即应当按工商业税条例附表所列的营业及所得分别课征。但规定十箱并不是起征点，即十箱以下的亦要计入。
    三、工商业税条例第一条规定，凡以营利为目的之工商事业征收工商业税。养蜂者出售蜜蜂、蜂蜜、蜂腊，已构成一种商业行为，故应该征税。
    政府提倡发展生产，但超过副业范围的商业收入应当纳税。纳税为人民光荣义务，有收入的应当出些负担，同时税率并不重，不应因纳税而不扩大生产。
