Mudanjiang State-Owned Factories
Universally Inspect Security Work
Machinery Factory Workers Propose 160 Improvement Suggestions

[This newspaper Mudanjiang News] The Mudanjiang State-Owned Power Plant, Songjiang Paper Mill, Mudanjiang Machinery Factory, Ceramics Factory, and other units have all universally conducted security inspections. All workers at the Mudanjiang Machinery Factory have proposed 160 suggestions for improving security work, and the factory's leading cadres have prioritized them based on their importance and urgency, and are gradually resolving them. Safety wooden covers have been universally installed on the factory's electric rollers. In the past, the cupola furnace did not have a chimney, and workers were repeatedly overcome by "gas." Although the workers had made many suggestions for improvement, they were not taken seriously. After the inspection, a chimney more than three meters high has now been installed. The State-Owned Third Cloth Shoe Factory, Printing Factory, Mudanjiang Textile Factory, Forestry Bureau, etc., have all conducted security inspections in conjunction with security learning. At present, the leading cadres of individual factories still do not fully understand the significance of security inspections and have not seriously implemented them; some factory leading cadres have complacency and paralysis regarding security work, believing that there is nothing to inspect. These deviations must be quickly corrected, and security work must be inspected seriously and thoroughly to protect factory safety.

　　牡丹江国营工厂
    普遍检查保安工作
    机械厂职工提出一百六十条改进意见
    【本报牡丹江讯】牡丹江市国营火力发电厂、松江造纸厂、牡丹江机械厂、陶瓷厂等单位都已普遍进行保安检查。牡丹江机械厂全体职工提出一百六十条改进保安工作的意见，该厂领导干部已分别轻重缓急，逐步解决。该厂电滚子已普遍按上安全木罩。化铁大炉上过去没有烟筒，工友曾被“瓦斯”薰倒数次。工友虽曾多次提出改进建议，均没被重视。经过检查后，现已按上了三米多高的烟筒。国营第三布鞋厂、印刷厂、牡丹江纺织厂、林务局等，都结合着保安学习，进行了保安检查。目前，个别工厂领导干部对保安检查的意义还认识不够，没有认真执行；有些工厂的领导干部，对保安工作存有自满麻痹思想，认为没啥可检查。以上这些偏向，必须迅速纠正，认真深入检查保安工作，保护工厂安全。
