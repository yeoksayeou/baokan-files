　　Electric Trams No Longer Fear Rain
　  Rationalization Proposals Solve a Twenty-Year-Old Problem
　　Peng Zhenshui
    Before liberation, the electric trams in the capital had three fears: fear of being attacked, fear of collisions, and fear of rain. After the liberation of Beijing, the Kuomintang soldiers and military vehicles were gone, and the workers were united, so the first two fears were completely eliminated. However, the problem of fearing rain still existed seriously. Last August, a heavy rain destroyed more than 30 locomotives. Although the employees worked hard to repair them in a short period of time afterward, it was not a fundamental solution. From that time on, the Party, government, and labor union called on employees to find ways to waterproof the trams. Everyone responded actively, improving resistance and modifying insulating paint. Although there were some achievements, they could not be completely solved. On February 24th of this year, Cai Dequan, head of the electrical engineering section, convened the first waterproofing meeting. At the meeting, the workers studied the reasons for the fear of water: first, because the resistance was installed under the car, the water stored on the track was splashed onto the resistance by the wheels, causing the resistance to short-circuit and burn out. Second, because the rollers needed to be checked for distance every day, there was a hole at the bottom of the motor skin close to the ground, which also easily allowed water to enter, causing the roller coil to become damp and burn out. At that time, everyone started to use their brains to address the above situation. Deng Faxi, from the overhaul team, suggested adding rubber pads to the roller holes and blocking them with iron plates at the back, tightening the iron plates with screws on both sides. When checking the distance, the screws could be loosened. Lu Yuntai, from the riveting team, tried to block the resistance with iron sheets, but the trial failed because it was not ventilated and the resistance generated heat. Everyone continued to propose ideas, with some advocating blocking the wheels to prevent water from splashing onto the resistance. Lu Yuntai then studied installing mudguards next to the wheels, using 7.5 mm iron sheets cut into 8.5 inch wide and 18.5 inch long iron plates, with rubber attached below, to completely block the mud and water brought up by the wheels. These two devices were installed on car number 22 for testing after being approved by the administration. Because it hadn't rained and because production was very tight, this work was put on hold. Only newly manufactured cars were equipped with this type of device. On April 15th, no one expected it to rain in the spring. Broken cars were found on the road. The company immediately decided to retrieve the cars, and only two were damaged due to the rapid retrieval. Just as everyone was celebrating that there were no broken cars, Soviet experts invited the workers to the municipal government to discuss the matter. He said: "Electric trams are most needed when it rains, but today we can't get on the trams. Our business is a small problem, and it affects the workers in various factories going to work and production. We must find a way to compensate for this loss..." The Soviet experts agreed with the workers' proposals to add two types of mudguards and hoped that all vehicles would be equipped within 25 days.
    On the morning of the 17th, the administrative labor union jointly convened a joint meeting of foremen and team leaders. At the meeting, the factory director reported the Soviet experts' hopes for us and sought everyone's opinions on waterproofing. Everyone believed that the trial of car number 22 had been successful and that these two devices could be installed. It was also proposed that everyone should continue to study the work of strengthening moisture resistance of insulating paint. This aspect was the responsibility of the electrical engineering section. Finally, everyone studied how to install the resistance water baffles and roller water baffles on 60 cars within 25 days. The factory director pointed out two paths: one was that one or two shifts could change the production plan and carry out a waterproofing blitz. The other was that each shift could transfer a group of people to specialize in waterproofing equipment, and the original work could proceed more slowly. Finally, everyone discussed and believed that waterproofing should be done, and the original production plan could not be reduced. The riveting team first proposed that two people could be transferred to specialize in making resistance water baffles and guaranteed that it would not affect the production plan during the blitz, only four people were needed to help with the work. The electrical engineering team was willing to chop iron sheets for the riveting team, solving the riveting team's problem of needing four people. The car framing team also expressed that they would blitz the work of roller water baffles in addition to repairing cars. Other ironwork, screws, and rubber pads were the responsibility of case workers, blacksmiths, carpenters, and lathe operators respectively. After the administration guaranteed the materials, the work began on the 21st. Each shift completed the task of this work in addition to completing its own production tasks. The electrical engineering day and night shifts participated in the blitz because they were not busy. Within 23 hours, 240 water baffle iron sheets used for 60 locomotives were completed. When the car framing team picked up the cars at night, they could install the roller water baffles on seven or eight cars a day when there were no broken cars. Although the rubber factory encountered a broken furnace and was waiting for materials, and sometimes the cars were sent to the North Factory and could not work, the waterproofing equipment was finally completed on May 3rd. The "May Day" rain was much heavier than the rain on April 15th, but the electric trams safely ran on the streets of the capital. When they returned to the factory for inspection at night, only two had broken resistances, and the other cars had no problems. According to everyone's estimate, they already had confidence in water below half a foot. From now on, the capital's electric trams will no longer have three fears.

### 电车再也不怕雨了  合理化建议解决了二十年来的大问题

　　电车再也不怕雨了
　  合理化建议解决了二十年来的大问题
　　彭振绥
    首都的电车，在解放前有三怕：一怕打，二怕撞，三怕下雨。北京解放后，国民党的军人和军车都没有了，工人团结了，前两怕也就彻底消灭。但怕雨的问题却仍严重地存在着。去年八月，一场大雨毁了三十多辆机车，事后虽经职工积极努力于短期内即行修复，但终不是根本解决的好办法。由那时起，党政工团便号召职工想法防水；大家都积极响应，改善阻力，改制绝缘漆，虽然有些成绩，但也不能彻底解决。今年二月二十四日，电工股股长蔡德铨召集了第一次防水会议。会上工友们研究了怕水的原因：第一是因阻力装在车下面，轨道上存水被车轮带起溅到阻力上，使阻力短连而烧坏。第二是滚子因每日要查距离，在马达皮的最下面有一个洞接近地面，也容易进水，使滚子线圈受潮烧坏。当时大家就对以上情况开动脑筋，大修班邓发熙建议滚子洞加设胶皮垫，后面用铁板挡着，铁板两边用螺丝紧上。检查距离时把螺丝落下来。铆工班卢运泰试用铁皮把阻力挡着，但试行后因不通风，阻力生热而失败。大家继续提议有的主张把车轮挡着，使水溅不到阻力上。卢运泰又研究车轮旁装设挡泥板，用七厘五的铁皮剁成八英寸半宽十八英寸半长的铁板，下面接上胶皮，整个挡着车轮所带起的泥和水。这两种设备，经行政同意后装在二二号车上试验。因一直没下雨，又因生产很紧张，这工作就停留着了。只有新造的车装有这种设备。四月十五日谁也想不到春天会下起大雨来。车路上发现有了坏车。公司马上决定收车，因收车迅速只有两辆遭到毁坏。大家正在庆祝没有坏车，下午苏联专家请工友到市府去商量，他说：“下雨的时候是最需要电车的，但今天却坐不着车了。我们营业是小问题，影响了各厂工友上班生产，这个损失我们一定要设法补偿……。”苏联专家同意了工友们提出的增设两种挡泥板的方法，并且希望要在二十五天内装齐所有的车辆。
    十七日上午行政工会联合召开了领班和小组长联席会。会上厂长报告了苏联专家对我们的希望，并征求大家对防水的意见。大家认为这次二二号车试行有成绩，可以装设这两种设备。并且提出大家要继续研究绝缘漆加强防潮的工作。这方面由电工股负责。最后大家研究二十五天内如何装好六十辆车的阻力挡水板和滚子挡水板。厂长指出两条路：一是一两班可以转变生产计划，做一次防水的突击。另一方面是各班抽调一批人专做防水设备，原定工作可以进行慢一点。最后大家讨论认为防水应该做，原订生产计划也不能减。铆工班首先提出可以抽调二人专做阻力挡水板，并保证在突击时不影响生产计划，只需调四个人帮助工作。电工班愿替铆工班剁铁皮，解决了铆工班要四个人的问题。架车班也表示自己在修车以外突击滚子挡水板的工作。其他铁活、螺丝、胶垫均由案工、锻工、木工、镟工分别负责。行政保证了材料后，工作由廿一日开始。各班在完成自己的生产任务外都完成了这件工作的任务。电工日夜班因工作不忙全体参加突击。在廿三小时内就完成了六十辆机车所用的二百四十块挡水板铁皮。架车班夜里收车后没坏车时一天就能装七八辆车的滚子挡水板。工作过程中虽然遇到橡胶厂炉坏而待料，和有时车收北厂不能工作，但终于在五月三日全部完成了防水设备。“五一”的大雨要比四月十五日大的多，电车却安全地跑在首都的街道上。晚上回厂检查，只有两辆是坏阻力的，其他的车都没出毛病。据大家估计，在半尺水以下已经有了把握。今后的首都电车再也没有三怕了。
