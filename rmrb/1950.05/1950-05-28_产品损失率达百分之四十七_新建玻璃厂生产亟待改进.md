　　Product Loss Rate Reaches Forty-Seven Percent
    Newly Built Glass Factory Production Urgently Needs Improvement

    [This Newspaper Dispatches] Reporter Feng Zhong reports: The Beijing Publicly Operated Newly Built Glass Factory's waste product and finished product loss rate for the first quarter of this year reached 47.6%, impacting relative cost increases, forming a major obstacle to the factory's future development. This factory specializes in manufacturing chemical glass instruments. Before the liberation of Beijing, this factory suffered severe damage from the Kuomintang reactionary army. Last year, it was rebuilt on the ruins. Initially, there were only eighteen workers, and now it has grown to more than one hundred and ninety people. The factory workers have high skills, and the product quality has a good reputation nationwide. The factory's manufacture of antenna insulators and glass oil eyes (for telecommunications and railway equipment, previously entirely reliant on foreign imports) has been successful. A major problem currently existing in the factory is the high loss rate of waste products and finished products: factory management has not yet been put on the right track; Party, government, and labor union leaders rarely conduct enlightening education for workers; workers' consciousness and sense of ownership are insufficient.

    The factory has been operating for a year, but several necessary systems have not yet been established. The wage system is very unreasonable. Apprentice workers, who make up three-fifths of the total number of employees in the factory, have been at the factory for eight or nine months, learning basic skills, but their treatment is still the same as newly arrived apprentices. The length of apprenticeship and promotion methods have also not been stipulated. In January of this year, the factory set a sixty-day production plan, which most workers overfulfilled. The administrative leadership never announced the results of the plan's completion and did not reward or commend those who actively overfulfilled the task, nor did they criticize those who failed to complete the task. The factory director and military representative subjectively want to run the factory well, but because they are busy with affairs all day long, they rarely go to the factory building to study and solve production problems. The Party's foundation in the factory is relatively weak. The labor union's orientation towards production is not clear, and it only focuses on minor matters such as workers' haircuts, baths, and dismantling and washing bedding. The workers' enthusiasm has not been mobilized, and production morale is quite low, making the phenomenon of product loss unavoidable.

    The factory's Factory Management Committee was established on May 12th, but because prior publicity and education for the workers were insufficient, many people still do not know what kind of organization the Management Committee is and are indifferent to it, thinking, "It's the same whether it's established or not." Conscientiously reforming and improving the Management Committee, implementing democratic management to enhance workers' sense of ownership is key to running the factory well.

### 产品损失率达百分之四十七  新建玻璃厂生产亟待改进

　　产品损失率达百分之四十七
    新建玻璃厂生产亟待改进
    【本报讯】记者冯仲报道：北京公营新建玻璃厂本年第一季废品和成品损失率达百分之四十七点六，影响成本相对提高，形成该厂今后发展的一大障碍。该厂专制化学玻璃仪器。北京解放前，该厂遭受国民党反动军队严重破坏。去年，即在废墟上重建起来。最初只有十八个工人，现在已发展到一百九十余人。该厂工人技术很高，产品质量在全国有很好的评价。该厂制造天线绝缘子，玻璃油眼（为电信及铁路器材，以前全赖外国输入），已获成功。该厂现在存在的一个大问题，是废品及成品的损失率很高：工厂管理尚未走上正轨；党、政、工领导干部很少对工人进行启发教育；工人的觉悟和主人翁感觉不够。
    该厂开工已经一年，但若干应有的制度尚未建立。工资制度很不合理。占全厂总人数五分之三的工徒，有的已到厂八、九个月，学会初步技术，他们的待遇仍和刚进厂的工徒相同。学徒年限和提升办法也未规定。今年一月间，该厂曾订了六十天的生产计划，大部工人超额完成。行政领导方面始终没有宣布计划完成的结果，对工作积极超额完成的，未曾奖励表扬，对未完成任务的，也没有批评。厂长和军代表主观上也想搞好工厂，但因终日忙于事务，很少到厂房去研究解决生产问题。该厂党的基础比较薄弱。工会面向生产的思想不明确，只在工人理发、洗澡、拆洗被褥等小事上打圈子。工人的积极性没有发动起来，生产情绪相当低落，产品损耗的现象就无法避免了。
    该厂工厂管理委员会已在五月十二日成立，但因事先对工人宣传教育不够，许多人还不知道管委会是一个什么组织，对它漠不关心，认为：“成立也好，不成立也好”。认真改造与健全管委会，实行民主管理，以提高工人主人翁的感觉，是该厂搞好生产的关键。
