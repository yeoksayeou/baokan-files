Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 9th. The Northwest Minority Youth and Women's Visiting Group returned to Xi'an on the 8th. The deputy leader of the group, Sa D'er (Uyghur), said when talking about the delegation's visit to Beijing: This visit to Beijing made us deeply realize that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can our ethnic minorities obtain true liberation and equal status. After arriving in Beijing this time, we not only learned many valuable experiences in national construction, but also enhanced our enthusiasm for loving Chairman Mao, loving the motherland, and building the Northwest.
