　　The Philippine-Chiang Reactionaries Collude
　　Extensive Searches of Overseas Chinese in Central Luzon
　　And a Conspiracy to Massively Force Overseas Chinese to Leave the Country
    [Xinhua News Agency, 12th] The Philippine Quirino government, colluding with the Kuomintang remnants, is plotting a large-scale persecution of Overseas Chinese in the Philippines. According to Manila news: Quirino met with Chen Zhishi, the "ambassador" of the Kuomintang remnants stationed in the Philippines, on the 10th. One of the central topics discussed was a plan to use "undesirable elements" as an excuse to massively deport Overseas Chinese.
    Following the strict inspections of local Overseas Chinese in Isabela Province, northeastern Luzon, at the end of April, the Quirino government's security forces have intensified their efforts, conducting thorough individual searches of Overseas Chinese in Central Luzon on May 8th.

    【新华社十二日讯】菲律宾季里诺政府与国民党残匪狼狈为奸，阴谋大规模迫害旅菲华侨。据马尼拉消息：季里诺十日接见国民党残匪驻菲“大使”陈质时，讨论的中心之一是计划以“不良分子”为借口，大规模将华侨驱逐出境。
    季里诺政府的警备部队，继四月底在吕宋东北伊萨贝拉省对当地华侨实行严格检查后，又变本加厉地于五月八日对中吕宋的华侨进行彻底的个别搜查。
