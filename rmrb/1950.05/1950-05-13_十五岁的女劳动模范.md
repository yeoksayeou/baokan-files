　　Fifteen-Year-Old Female Model Worker
　　Li Zhensheng
　　Liu Guiqin is a member of the Communist Youth League from Xiaobaiqibao Village, Fourth District, Xinmin, Northeast China. At the Second Labor Model Congress of Liaoxi Province, she was the youngest of more than seventy first-class labor models, only fifteen years old this year.
　　Last year, Xinmin suffered from floods, and the land was waterlogged. She started engaging in sideline basket weaving in February, and in one year, she bought more than three *shi* of grain with the income from basket weaving. In July, the government called on people to collect wild vegetables to survive the famine, and she led the women to collect wild vegetables, collecting more than seventy *jin* herself, which was used as a substitute for grain.
　　In early December last year, comrades from the Xinmin County Committee of the Communist Youth League came to Xiaobaiqibao Village to establish the League. Liu Guiqin actively requested to join the League, but her mother stopped her: "What's the point of joining the League? What if they transfer you away?" So she asked her sister to explain to her mother, and finally persuaded her. Then she gloriously joined the Communist Youth League.
　　The main sideline production in their village is basket weaving, but the masses are all working individually and have not participated in groups to engage in sideline production. Zhou Guilan (a Party member), the deputy secretary of the League branch, said to Liu Guiqin: "We must take the lead in organizing groups to weave baskets and promote the whole village!" Liu Guiqin discussed it with four other young women "one non-League member" and formed a basket weaving group, with Liu Guiqin as the group leader. Everyone decided that two people would cut strips and three people would weave at home, and the score would be based on each person's performance. On the first day, three people wove a total of fifteen baskets, which tripled the efficiency compared to working alone. In three or four days, they wove more than fifty baskets, sold them for more than 300,000 yuan, and each person received 60,000 to 70,000 yuan based on the score. The whole village reflected: "The Communist Youth League is really playing a role, and the basket weaving group is really beneficial for sideline production!" Later, the whole village was generally organized to engage in sideline production.
　　At the end of December last year, the Party branch and the League branch called on people to guarantee the completion of the public grain task. Liu Guiqin and several other League members went to the village shacks to publicize and inspect public grain. Wu Bangyi's two *dou* and nine *sheng* of public grain had not been winnowed, so Liu Guiqin and the others winnowed more than one *dou*, influencing Old Wu's family to winnow all the public grain themselves. Because of their careful and serious inspection and patient persuasion, the public grain in Dujia Shack was very good, and no portion was returned, and the task was completed in five days, and was praised by the district.
　　When organizing the masses to attend winter school, Liu Guiqin first persuaded her mother and brother to allow her sister-in-law to attend winter school, and gave lectures to the villagers, mobilizing more than fifty people in total. Many old ladies were afraid of the cold and unwilling to go, so they taught the old ladies to read at home. Liu Guiqin taught her seventh aunt and eighth aunt three or four times a day, and also gave exams the next day. Now the old ladies also know more than fifty characters.
　　Now, the Communist Youth League has a very high prestige in Xiaobaiqibao Village. If the Women's Federation has anything that cannot be resolved, they all look for League members, and many young people apply to join the League. When selecting labor models, the masses selected Liu Guiqin. From the district to the county, from the county to the province, she was also rated as a first-class labor model in the province.

　　十五岁的女劳动模范
　　李振胜
    刘桂琴是东北新民四区小白旗堡村的青年团员。在辽西省第二届劳动模范大会上，七十余名一等劳动模范里她是最小的一个，今年才十五岁。
    去年新民闹水灾，地都涝了。她从二月开始搞副业编筐，一年里用编筐的收入买了三石多粮。七月间政府号召采野菜渡荒，她带起妇女们采野菜，自己采了七十多斤，顶粮食用。
    去年十二月初，青年团新民县工委的同志到小白旗堡村建团。刘桂琴积极要求入团，她妈阻拦她：“入团干什么？把你调走怎办？”她就托姐姐给母亲解释，终于说通了，她便光荣地加入了青年团。
    她们村子的副业生产主要是编筐，但群众都是单干，没有参加小组搞副业的。团支部副书记周桂兰（党员）就跟刘桂琴说：“咱们要带头组织小组编筐，推动全村！”刘桂琴就和另外四个青年妇女“一个非团员”商议好，组成一个编筐小组，刘桂琴当组长。大家决定两个人割条子，三个人在家编，根据每人成绩评分。头一天，三个人共编了十五个筐，效率比单干提高了三倍。三、四天工夫她们就编了五十多个筐，卖三十多万元，每人根据评分分了六、七万。全村都反映：“青年团真起作用，编筐小组搞副业真有好处！”后来全村都普遍的组织起来搞副业了。
    去年十二月末，党支部和团支部号召保证完成公粮任务。刘桂琴和另外几个团员到村家窝棚去宣传和检查公粮。吴邦义家的二斗九升公粮没簸，刘桂琴她们就给簸了一斗多，影响老吴家自己把公粮都簸了。由于他们细心认真检查和耐心说服，杜家窝棚的公粮都很好，没有一份退回来的，并且在五天里就完成了任务，受到区里表扬。
    组织群众上冬学时，刘桂琴首先说服了母亲和哥哥允许她的嫂子上冬学，并给老乡开会讲道理，共动员了五十多人。很多老太太怕冷不愿去，她们就在家里教老太太们认字。刘桂琴教她七婶、八婶，一天教三、四遍，第二天还考试。现在老太太也都认识五十多个字了。
    现在，青年团在小白旗堡村威信很高，妇女会有啥事解决不了都找团员，有很多青年申请入团。选劳动模范时，群众就选了刘桂琴。从区到县，从县到省，在省里又评为全省一等劳动模范。（转载五月四日东北日报）
