　　Letter of Correction

　　According to a letter from the Machinery Bureau of the Ministry of Railways: "In the People's Daily, May 6th, second page, the news item 'Northeast Two Locomotives Break Through the 3,000-Ton Haulage Record' mentions that the '攵Т一○九一号' locomotive of the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot of the Shenyang Railway Bureau is actually a mistake for 'ㄇㄎ一八○一号'. Also, in the 'Fourth Hero Medal' article published in the People's Garden column on the fourth page of May 5th, it says that the old hero Liu Kun 'later encountered difficulties in the Harbin locomotive work'. According to our understanding, Liu Kun never worked in Harbin but served as the deputy head of the Hailar Locomotive Depot, and later we heard that he entered the customs and worked in the Hengyang Railway Bureau. In order to ensure accurate records, we are hereby submitting this supplementary information. We are sending this letter specifically to request corrections."

　　来函更正
    据铁道部机务总局来函称：“人民日报五月六日第二版刊载之‘东北两机车牵引量突破三千吨纪录’消息中所说沈阳局苏家屯机务段‘攵Т一○九一号’，查系‘ㄇㄎ一八○一号’之误。又，五月五日第四版人民园地栏登载‘第四个英雄勋章’文中所说老英雄刘昆‘后来又遇到哈尔滨的机务工作发生了困难’，据我们了解：刘昆并未在哈尔滨工作过，曾在海拉尔机务段充任过副段长，后来听说进关在衡阳局工作。为记载翔实计，爰代补充。特函请分别更正”。
