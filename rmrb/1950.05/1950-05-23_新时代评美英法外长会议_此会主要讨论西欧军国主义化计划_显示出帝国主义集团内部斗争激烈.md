　　New Era Commentary on US-UK-France Foreign Ministers' Meeting
    This Meeting Mainly Discussed the Militarization Plan for Western Europe; Demonstrating Intense Internal Struggles Within the Imperialist Bloc
    [Xinhua News Agency, 20th] TASS reports: The "New Era" magazine published an article by Yermashov, commenting on the London meeting of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France, stating: This meeting was mainly to discuss the plans for the remilitarization of West Germany and the militarization of Western Europe. Acheson's hasty trip to Europe this time was because the Marshall Plan had already failed. Therefore, they must replace it with a plan more suitable for American economic and political aggression.

    The internal struggles of the North Atlantic bloc are further proven by the "phased" approach of this meeting. Acheson first went to Paris to negotiate with Schuman; the two issues they negotiated were: Indochina and West Germany.

    The author pointed out: The Acheson-Schuman agreement to aid Bao Dai is equivalent to the United States directly interfering militarily in Indochina. However, this agreement is fatal to France because the price the United States is demanding for participating in the Vietnam War is France's complete surrender to the United States on the issue of the revival of German imperialism and the remilitarization of West Germany.

    The so-called joint Franco-German management of coal and iron is essentially a collusion between American and German industrial tycoons, with American monopoly capital as the protagonist, to merge the heavy industries of West Germany and France, as well as the heavy industries of Belgium and Luxembourg which are inevitably included, into a trust in order to expand the war industrial base in this European heartland to the maximum extent possible.

    The remilitarization of West Germany is precisely the main means by which American monopoly capital militarizes the entire Western Europe, thereby completely controlling Western Europe.

    The author emphasized: However, this plan cannot but arouse the most resolute resistance from the people of Western Europe and very fierce struggles within the imperialist camp. At the same time, these malicious plans remind the great people's peace movement of the need to intensify the struggle for peace.

　　新时代评美英法外长会议
    此会主要讨论西欧军国主义化计划  显示出帝国主义集团内部斗争激烈
    【新华社二十日讯】据塔斯社讯：《新时代》杂志刊出叶尔马邵夫一篇专文，评论美、英、法三国外长的伦敦会议称：这个会议主要是为了讨论西德的再军国主义化和西欧的军国主义化的计划。艾奇逊这次急急赴欧，原因就是马歇尔计划业已失败。因此他们必须用更适合美国经济与政治侵略的计划来代替它。
    北大西洋集团的内部斗争，可以由这次会议之分“阶段”进行，得到又一证明。艾奇逊先到巴黎与舒曼谈判；他们谈判的两个问题是：印度支那和西德。
    作者指出：艾奇逊、舒曼援助保大的协定，等于美国直接以军事干涉印度支那。但是这一协定对法国是致命的，因为美国在参与越南战争上所索取的代价，是要法国在德国帝国主义复活和西德的重行军国主义化的问题上，向美国完全投降。
    所谓法、德联合经营煤铁，实质上是由美、德的工业大亨们串通一气，以美国垄断资本为主角，把西德与法国重工业以及不可避免地囊括比、卢的重工业，合并为一个托辣斯，以便竭力把这个欧洲心脏地区的战争工业基地，扩张至最大限度。
    西德的重行军国主义化，正是美国垄断资本使整个西欧军国主义化，从而完全控制西欧的主要手段。
    作者着重指出：但是这个计划却不能不激起西欧人民最坚决的反抗，和帝国主义阵营内部非常激烈的斗争。同时这些恶毒计划对伟大的人民和平运动来说，更提醒了有尽力加紧为争取和平而斗争的必要。
