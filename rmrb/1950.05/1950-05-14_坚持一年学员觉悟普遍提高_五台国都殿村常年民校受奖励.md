　　Perseverance for a Year Leads to Universal Improvement in Students' Awareness; Wutai Guodu Dian Village's Year-Round People's School Receives Award

　　[Report from this newspaper, Wutai] Correspondent Zhang Jiucheng reports: Guodu Dian Village in Wutai County, Shanxi Province, established a year-round people's school in February of last year. Over the past year, it has gradually expanded and persisted in learning, and has recently received an award from the Department of Culture and Education. Guodu Dian Village completed land reform in 1947, and many formerly unschooled children of liberated peasants were sent to school by their parents. Young people who had previously been out of school also felt the importance of learning culture. In February of last year, youth Luo Zhihe took the lead, contacting six other young people to form a study group that met at the primary school every evening. Other young people saw how enthusiastically they were learning and joined in. Luo Zhihe then proposed officially establishing a youth night school, which everyone supported. The night school was formally established in mid-February with sixteen students and teachers were publicly elected and divided into two groups for study.

　　The opening of the youth night school stimulated the desire for progress among the village women. Women's Federation Director Liu Guishuang contacted sixteen young women to establish a women's afternoon school. The two people's schools then launched a competition with each other, creating a learning boom. Within a month, the number of students in the youth night school increased to twenty, and the women's afternoon school increased to twenty-five. After the autumn harvest, there were more students, with all twenty-five of the village's young people enrolled, and twenty-four adults joined the learning. The women's afternoon school increased to fifty-two people.

　　Their curriculum content was determined by everyone through democratic discussion. Within a week: the youth night school spent two hours each on arithmetic (including abacus) and Chinese language (literacy, sentence practice), and one hour on politics and general knowledge of nature. The women's afternoon school spent one hour each on literacy at 4 pm, politics, and arithmetic. After eight months of study, testing was conducted last autumn: the first group of the youth night school had learned abacus division, written multiplication, and word problems for addition and subtraction. In Chinese class, they learned how to write receipts and informal letters. In terms of political common sense, they learned about the establishment of the People's Republic of China and its great significance, as well as the existing democratic parties in China; in terms of natural common sense, they understood the origins of rain, wind, thunder, and lightning, and some common sense about crops. In addition to learning the above common sense, the second group learned addition and subtraction in abacus and written arithmetic, and recognized an average of more than two hundred new characters. The women's afternoon school students learned a maximum of 201 characters and a minimum of 147, and also learned mixed problems of addition, subtraction, and multiplication. In addition, they also learned some current domestic affairs and policies on maternal and infant hygiene and marriage.

　　Their learning was combined with production. After political education at the people's school, the political awareness of the students was universally improved. Young people and women each formed four groups to support the military, consciously helping the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers to solve various difficulties. According to incomplete statistics from last year: the young people provided 27 workdays of plowing land with donkeys for the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers, 15 nights of herding sheep and collecting manure, plowed 119 mu of land, cut 2,990 jin of firewood, and planted and hoed 22 mu of corn, and harvested 12 mu of crops. The women plowed 26 mu of land for the families of martyrs, soldiers, and workers, carried 105 baskets of manure, and cut 510 jin of firewood. When picking peppercorns in August last year, at the request of the women, the people's school took a half-month break. In addition to picking for their own families, each woman also picked an average of more than 220 jin for others, earning 1 jin of rice for every 6 jin picked, earning 37 jin of rice per person. The young people worked and learned at the same time in production, truly achieving "no delay in both production and learning."

　　In addition, the students solved the funding of the people's school through their own labor. Last year, the students collectively carried 3,520 jin of charcoal and cut 1,470 jin of firewood, which was exchanged for millet to supply the people's school with lamp oil, stationery, paper, and other expenses for the whole year. At the same time, they also cut firewood and carried charcoal for the volunteer teachers in exchange for labor. Therefore, the volunteer teachers were also willing to serve everyone.

　　坚持一年学员觉悟普遍提高
　　五台国都殿村常年民校受奖励
    【本报五台讯】通讯员张久成报道：山西五台县国都殿村，去年二月成立常年民校，一年多来逐渐扩大，坚持学习，最近获得了文教厅的奖励。国都殿村在一九四七年完成了土地改革，许多翻身农民的失学子弟，都被家长送入学校学习。过去失学的青年，也感到学习文化的重要。去年二月，青年罗治和首先发起，联络了六个青年，组成学习小组，每晚到小学校去学习。别的青年见他们学得很起劲，也纷纷加入。罗治和又提出正式办青年夜校，大家都很赞成。二月半正式成立了夜校，共有学员十六人，并公推了教员，分成两组学习。
    青年夜校的开办，激发了村里妇女的上进心。妇联主任刘桂双，联络了十六名女青年，成立了妇女午校。两个民校就互相展开竞赛，造成了学习热潮。一月之内，青年夜校学员增加到二十人，妇女午校增到二十五人。秋收以后，学员又有增加，全村青年二十五人全部入学，还有二十四个壮年加入学习。妇女午校则增至五十二人。
    他们的课程内容，都是由大家民主讨论确定的。一星期内：青年夜校上算术（包括珠算）、国语（识字、练句）各两小时，政治和自然常识一小时。妇女午校是四点钟识字，政治和算术各一点钟。经过八个月的学习，到去年秋天测验：青年夜校甲组已学会珠算的一位归除，笔算的乘法和加减法的文字题。国语课学会了开收据、写便信；政治常识方面，知道了中华人民共和国成立的经过及其重大意义，以及中国现有的各民主党派等；自然常识方面弄懂了雨、风、雷、电的来历和一些农作物的常识。乙组除学了上述常识外，珠算、笔算，学会了加减法，平均认生字二百以上。妇女午校学员最多的学了二百零一个字，最少的一百四十七个，并且学会了加减乘法的混合题。另外也学了一些当前国内大事和妇婴卫生、婚姻等政策。
    他们的学习是结合生产进行的，经过民校的政治教育，学员的政治觉悟普遍提高。青年和妇女各结成四个优军小组，自觉地帮助烈、军、工属解决各种困难。据去年不完全统计：青年们给烈军工属牵驴耕地用二十七个工，看羊踩粪十五夜，刨地一百十九亩，砍柴二千九百九十斤，种、锄玉茭二十二亩，收割庄稼十二亩。妇女们给烈军工属刨地二十六亩，背粪一百零五篓，刨柴五百一十斤。去年八月间摘花椒时，在妇女们的要求下，民校放假半月。许多妇女除给自家摘完外，每人还平均给别人摘了二百二十多斤，按摘六斤赚一斤米计，每人赚了三十七斤米。青年们在生产中，一面干活，一面学习，真正做到了“生产、学习两不误”。
    此外，学员们通过自己的劳力，解决了民校的经费。去年学员们集体背炭三千五百二十斤，砍柴一千四百七十斤，换成小米，供给了民校全年的灯油、文具、纸张等开支。同时，他们又以换工方式为义务教员砍柴、背炭。因此，义务教员也乐意为大家服务。
