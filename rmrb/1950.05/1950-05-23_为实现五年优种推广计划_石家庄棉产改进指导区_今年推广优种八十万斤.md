(From Our Newspaper in Shijiazhuang) The Shijiazhuang Cotton Production Improvement Guidance Area in Hebei Province is vigorously promoting the use of superior cotton seeds in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City and Shijiazhuang Prefecture in order to realize the five-year cotton superior seed promotion plan. The Shijiazhuang Municipal Government and the Shijiazhuang Prefectural Commissioner's Office are closely cooperating and, according to local soil conditions and the people's past cotton planting habits, have determined that 62 villages in 6 districts of Shijiazhuang City and 143 villages in 13 districts of the four counties of Zhengding, Jinxian, Huolu, and Gaocheng in Shijiazhuang Prefecture will be superior cotton seed breeding areas. At the same time, technical cadres from the Cotton Production Improvement Guidance Area, in conjunction with the local government, have gone deep into the superior variety promotion areas to carry out publicity and mobilization, specifically identifying households planting superior varieties, helping them make household plans, and combining this with general cotton planting to strengthen technical guidance and accelerate sowing. As of May 10, statistics show that 96,154.5 jin of superior varieties in Shijiazhuang City have been promoted, with 39,176 mu sown; 189,999.5 jin of Jinxian cotton seeds have been promoted, with 38,599.45 mu sown; 227,289 jin of Zhengding cotton seeds have been promoted, with 57,567.7 mu sown; 82,965 jin of Gaocheng cotton seeds have been promoted, with 10,094 mu sown; and 230,666.5 jin of Huolu cotton seeds have been promoted, with 46,445 mu sown. A total of 827,075 jin of "2B" (i.e., S cotton No. 2, roughly the same as S cotton No. 4, with fiber length from 1 inch to 1 and 1/16 inches, which can spin 32 to 42 count yarn) and "4B" (i.e., S cotton No. 4, with fiber length of about 1 inch, which can spin 32 count yarn, and yields about 180 jin of seed cotton per mu.) superior cotton seeds have been loaned out, completing the sowing of 191,881.95 mu, exceeding the original plan of 120,000 mu by more than 70,000 mu.
　　All cotton seeds, having been screened, sorted by grain, and selected by the masses, have a germination rate of over 80% after sowing. Cotton farmers have reacted favorably. It is estimated that, at a minimum yield of 120 jin of seed cotton per mu, 23,025,834 jin of seed cotton can be harvested. With each jin of seed cotton yielding 10 liang of cotton seeds, over 14 million jin of cotton seeds can be produced. With 7 jin of seeds sown per mu, superior varieties can be promoted on 2 million mu next year.

    今年推广优种八十万斤
    【本报石家庄讯】河北石家庄棉产改进指导区，为了实现五年棉花优种推广计划，在石家庄市郊及石家庄专区大力开展优良棉种推广工作。石家庄市政府及石家庄专署取得密切结合，并按各地土质条件、群众以往种棉习惯，确定了石家庄市六个区六十二个村、石家庄专区的正定、晋县、获鹿、藁城四县十三个区，一百四十三个村为优良棉种繁殖区。同时，棉产改进指导区技术干部结合当地政府，深入优良品种推广区，进行宣传动员，具体确定了优良品种种植户，帮助作出户的计划；并与一般植棉结合，加强技术指导，突击播种。截至五月十日统计，推广石家庄市优良品种九万六千一百五十四斤半，播种三万九千一百七十六亩；晋县棉种十八万九千九百九十九斤半，播种三万八千五百九十九亩四分五；正定棉种二十二万七千二百八十九斤，播种五万七千五百六十七亩四分；藁城棉种八万二千九百六十五斤，播种一万零九十四亩；获鹿棉种二十三万零六百六十六斤半，播种四万六千四百四十五亩；共计贷出“二Ｂ”（即斯字棉二号，大致同斯字棉四号，纤维长度从一英寸到一又十六分之一英寸，可纺三十二支至四十二支纱。）、“四Ｂ”（即斯字棉四号，纤维长度约一英寸，可纺三十二支纱，每亩籽棉产量约一百八十斤。）优良棉种八十二万七千零七十五斤，完成播种十九万一千八百八十一亩九分五厘，超过原计划十二万亩的七万余亩。
    所有棉籽，因经过筛选、粒选及群众拣选，播种后检查，发芽率均在百分之八十以上。棉农反映良好。估计每亩最低按产量一百二十斤籽棉计算，能收籽棉二千三百零二万五千八百三十四斤，每斤籽棉以出籽十两计，可出籽一千四百多万斤，每亩播种七斤，明年即可推广优良品种二百万亩。
