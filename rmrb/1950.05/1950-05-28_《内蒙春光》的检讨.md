　　Self-Criticism of "Springtime in Inner Mongolia"
　　Wang Zhenzhi
　　Editor's Note: This journal published articles by comrades Buhe and Zhong Dianfei on the film "Springtime in Inner Mongolia" on April 30th. These articles generally praised "Springtime in Inner Mongolia" and did not point out its shortcomings and errors in the portrayal of ethnic policies. The editor also failed to see these shortcomings and errors, which was incorrect. Now we are publishing the self-criticism of Comrade Wang Zhenzhi, the screenwriter of "Springtime in Inner Mongolia," and hope that readers will pay attention. We broadly agree with his self-criticism and hope that the revised "Springtime in Inner Mongolia" will achieve genuine success.
　　After "Springtime in Inner Mongolia" was released, in addition to hearing much encouragement, I heard serious criticisms of its content. The film made an incorrect depiction of the Communist Party's and the People's Government's ethnic policies. As the screenwriter of the film, I feel that this error is serious. We are currently revising the film. I am now writing my initial self-criticism, hoping that everyone will give it strict criticism and offer suggestions for revision.
　　The story of the film attempts to reflect the actual situation in the eastern part of Inner Mongolia in the autumn of 1947. At that time, eastern Inner Mongolia was in the early stages of the Liberation War, and only two paths were presented to the people of Inner Mongolia: one was to accept the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries' Great Han chauvinism, which would plunge the Inner Mongolian people into an even deeper abyss of misery; the other was to accept the Communist Party's policies of ethnic equality and ethnic unity, and to fight alongside the people of all of China in the war against the Kuomintang reactionaries' attempt to enslave the people of the whole country, striving for the victory of the people of all of China and thereby achieving the liberation of their own nation. The people of eastern Inner Mongolia chose the latter path—under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, they fought alongside the people of all of China, defeated the common enemy of the Mongolian and Han nationalities, the Kuomintang Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and achieved the liberation of their own nation through struggle. This historical fact powerfully demonstrates that the liberation of the people of Inner Mongolia is inseparable from the victory of the people of the whole country.
　　Simultaneous with the above-mentioned struggle was the internal struggle within the eastern Inner Mongolian nationality. A small number of reactionary upper-class elements in eastern Inner Mongolia, because they were deluded by the temporary strength of the Kuomintang reactionaries, embarked on the path of colluding with the enemy and betraying the nation, and thus caused some disasters for the people of Inner Mongolia; they themselves were eventually overthrown by the people of Inner Mongolia. However, weighing these two aspects of the struggle, the struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries should be the fundamental and main one after all. This is because, first, the Kuomintang reactionaries were the common enemy of the people of all of China (including the Inner Mongolian nationality), the traitors who sold out the interests of the Chinese people, the running dogs of American imperialism, and the behind-the-scenes masterminds of the small number of reactionary princes in eastern Inner Mongolia at that time; if the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries were not fundamentally overthrown, the treacherous acts of the enemies within eastern Inner Mongolia could not be eradicated. Second, the Kuomintang reactionaries have consistently been Great Han chauvinists; on the one hand, they tempted a small number of Inner Mongolian princes who did not understand the situation, and used this to achieve their attempt to enslave the people of Inner Mongolia; on the other hand, they fundamentally denied the existence and rights of all fraternal nationalities in China in theory, and implemented policies of high pressure, looting, and massacre against all fraternal nationalities in action, causing the people of Inner Mongolia to be filled with national hatred and estrangement towards the Han people. If this national hatred and estrangement, created by long-term history, is not eliminated through arduous work, the true liberation and friendly cooperation of all nationalities is impossible. Therefore, the primary enemy in the Inner Mongolian people's struggle for liberation was undoubtedly the Kuomintang reactionaries, the common enemy of the people of all of China and also Great Han chauvinists; this is an undeniable historical truth.
　　Although the film "Springtime in Inner Mongolia" also exposed the crimes of the Kuomintang bandit army in robbing the grasslands and trampling on the people of Inner Mongolia, the script depicted the Inner Mongolian people's struggle against internal feudal oppression as the center, while the depiction of the crimes of the Kuomintang Great Han chauvinists was very insufficient. For example, in portraying the character of the Kuomintang special agent "Mr. Yang," it only generally depicted his drinking, pleasure-seeking, and raping of women, some superficial misdeeds, but did not better expose the essential nature of the Kuomintang special agents' crimes that truly brought disaster and pain to the people of Inner Mongolia. This not only obscured the main task of the revolution—to overthrow the Kuomintang reactionaries, the common enemy of the Mongolian and Han people—but also would lead the audience to mistakenly believe that the way to solve ethnic problems is not to promote ethnic unity against the common enemies of all nationalities—the Kuomintang reactionaries and the American imperialists they collude with and depend on—but, on the contrary, to launch an anti-feudal struggle within all nationalities when conditions are not yet ripe. The liberation of minority nationalities is only possible after the common enemies of all nationalities in China—foreign imperialism and its domestic running dogs, the Kuomintang reactionaries—are overthrown. From the perspective of a nationality in isolation, the reactionary rulers within that nationality are naturally the main enemies of the people, but from a global perspective, a small number of reactionary princes and upper-class elements, after the common enemies of all nationalities in China are overthrown, will inevitably lose their reliance and become a problem that is easier to deal with. Therefore, although "Springtime in Inner Mongolia" relatively profoundly exposed the class contradictions within the Inner Mongolian nationality, the people's suffering and resistance, as a true reflection of the history of the liberation of minority nationalities, it is erroneous.
　　The script, through the awakening of the character Dendeub, attempts to show that the people of Inner Mongolia, through class consciousness and lessons of fact, eliminated the national hatred caused by the reactionary ruling class and achieved the unity of the Mongolian and Han people. However, because the script did not touch on the historical reasons why the people of Inner Mongolia hated the Han people, which were formed by their personal experiences of being oppressed and excluded by Great Han chauvinists over the years, the idea of Dendeub hating the Han people does not have his actual basis, and the solution to the problem also appears powerless.
　　Because the basic task of the Inner Mongolian people's revolution was not clarified, the handling of the character of the prince in the film is also inappropriate, especially the attitude of Comrade Suhe, who represents the Communist Party, towards the prince, which is also not in line with the Communist Party's ethnic policies. I only saw the prince's oppression of the people and the fact that the dregs of the minority nationalities colluded with the enemy and betrayed the country, but I neglected that in the face of the Kuomintang reactionaries' Great Han chauvinism, such a prince, although there are contradictions between him and the masses of the people of his own nationality, also has contradictions with the Kuomintang reactionaries, and therefore, under certain conditions, the people have the possibility of winning over or neutralizing these upper-class elements. The Chinese Communist Party's policy is to strive for the realization of this possibility, and to adopt a firm policy of unity and striving for the upper-class elements of minority nationalities. The purpose of this policy is to concentrate forces to strike at imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and to eliminate the national hatred created by the Kuomintang reactionaries, to achieve national unity and the liberation of all nationalities. The actual example, taking the Yimeng Incident during the War of Resistance Against Japan as an example, the Kuomintang Great Han chauvinist army occupied Shawangfu, looted all the property of the Wangfu, and forced Shawang to a dead end. However, under the correct ethnic policy of the Chinese Communist Party, Shawang was received by the CPC Central Committee and the Northwest Bureau, and found a place to settle down in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. Shawang was deeply moved and never said anything against the Communist Party until his death. That is, as reflected in the "Springtime in Inner Mongolia" script, in the early days of the Liberation War, some reactionary upper-class elements in eastern Inner Mongolia, because they held illusions about the strength of the Kuomintang and did not believe in the strength of the people, had acts of colluding with the enemy and betraying the country, but the Chinese Communist Party still absorbed the upper-class elements of eastern Inner Mongolia, including these once reactionary upper-class elements, to participate in government work and carried out transformation and education on them. However, the "Springtime in Inner Mongolia" script neglected the possibility that the upper-class elements of minority nationalities could be won over or kept neutral in opposing Great Han chauvinism, and portrayed the prince as very stubborn and unrepentant until his death, as if this were the representative of ordinary princes. More importantly, it neglected the important aspect of the Party's policy of unity and striving, so that when Secretary Buhe explained the task in the first scene of the script, he did not mention the work of striving for the princes and upper-class elements at all, and later, in Suhe's contact with the princes, he did not show the utmost efforts to strive for and unite with the princes, but instead showed an overbearing and arrogant style everywhere. This is due to the lack of policy thinking in the script.
　　Although I also deeply felt when writing this script that I should be very cautious in handling ethnic issues, according to this study of Chapter VI of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, comparing the content of the film, I deeply felt that my understanding had a great distance from the ethnic policies in the Common Program and the cautious approach taken by the People's Government on ethnic issues.
　　In the work of revising "Springtime in Inner Mongolia," Comrade Gan Xuewei and I will do our best to make it reflect the actual historical situation in the process of implementing our ethnic policies more truthfully and correctly, so that this film can be improved in terms of policy thinking.

### 《内蒙春光》的检讨

　　《内蒙春光》的检讨
    王震之
    编者按：本刊于四月三十日刊登了布赫与钟惦篚两同志关于影片《内蒙春光》的文章，这两篇文章对《内蒙春光》一般都是赞扬的，没有指出它在表现民族政策上的缺点和错误。编者也没有看出这种缺点和错误，这是不对的。现在发表《内蒙春光》编剧者王震之同志的检讨，望读者注意。我们大体同意他的检讨，并希望修改后的《内蒙春光》，获得真正的成功。
    《内蒙春光》上演之后，除听到许多鼓励之外，听到了对它内容上的错误的严正的批评。这部影片对共产党和人民政府的民族政策作了不正确的描写。作为该片的编剧，我觉得这个错误是严重的。我们正在对这影片进行修改的工作。我现在把我自己初步的检讨写出来，希望大家给以严格的批评，并对修改提出意见。
    影片的故事，是企图反映一九四七年秋东蒙一带的实际情况。当时东蒙是处在解放战争初期的环境里，摆在内蒙人民面前的只有两条道路：一条是接受国民党反动派大汉族主义的统治，使内蒙民族陷入更深的悲惨的深渊里；另一条道路，便是接受共产党的民族平等、民族团结的政策，在反对国民党反动派企图奴役全国人民的战争里，和全中国人民一起战斗，争取全中国人民的胜利，从而获得自己民族的解放。东蒙人民所选的，是后一条道路——在中国共产党的领导下，和全中国人民一起，战胜了蒙汉两民族的共同敌人国民党蒋介石匪帮，从斗争中取得了自己民族的解放。这历史的事实有力地说明了内蒙人民的解放，和全国人民的胜利是分不开的。
    与上述的斗争同时进行的，是东蒙民族内部的斗争。东蒙少数的反动上层分子，因为迷惑于国民党反动派暂时的实力强大，走上了通敌叛卖的道路，因而给内蒙人民制造了一些灾祸，他们自己最后也被内蒙人民所打倒。但是权衡这两方面的斗争，对于国民党反动派的斗争毕竟应该是根本的和主要的。这是因为，第一，国民党反动派是全中国人民（内蒙民族也在内）的公敌，是出卖中国人民利益的卖国贼，是美帝国主义的走狗，是当时东蒙的少数背叛东蒙人民利益的反动王公们的幕后主使者；如果不从根本上打倒国民党反动派的统治，便无从根绝东蒙内部敌人的叛卖行为。第二，国民党反动派一贯地是大汉族主义者，他们一方面诱惑少数不明事理的内蒙王公，并借此以遂其奴役内蒙人民的企图，另一方面又从理论上根本否认中国各兄弟民族的民族存在和民族权利，在行动上对各兄弟民族实施着高压、抢掠、屠杀的政策，使得内蒙人民对汉人充满民族仇恨和隔阂。如果不用艰苦的工作消除这种长期历史造成的民族仇恨和隔阂，各民族的真正解放和友爱合作是不可能的。因此，成为内蒙人民解放斗争中最主要的敌人的，首先是全中国人民的公敌也是大汉族主义者的国民党反动派，这是无可怀疑的历史的真实。
    影片《内蒙春光》中虽然也暴露了国民党匪军抢劫草原，和蹂躏内蒙人民的罪行，但剧本中把内蒙人民反对内部的封建压迫的斗争当作中心来加以描写，而对于国民党大汉族主义者的罪行描写得却十分不足，如在刻划国民党特务“杨先生”这一人物时，只一般的描写了他的饮酒，享乐，强奸妇女这一些表面的劣迹，对于国民党特务真正带给内蒙人民以灾难和痛苦的罪恶的本质则没有更好地去揭露。这不仅把革命的主要任务——打倒蒙汉人民公敌国民党反动派——弄得模糊不清，并且会使观众错误地以为：解决各民族问题的方法不是去促进民族团结反对各民族的共同敌人——国民党反动派，和它所勾结与依附的美帝国主义者，相反的却是在条件不成熟的时候去掀起各民族内部的反封建斗争。少数民族的解放只有在中国各民族人民的共同敌人——外国帝国主义及其国内走狗国民党反动派——被打倒以后才有可能。从一个民族孤立地来看，这民族内部反动统治者自然是人民的主要敌人，但就全局来看，少数反动王公上层分子，当中国各民族人民的共同敌人被打倒之后，他们必然失却依靠，成为一个较易被处理的问题了。因此《内蒙春光》虽然比较深刻地揭露了内蒙民族内部的阶级矛盾，人民的痛苦和反抗，但作为少数民族解放历史的一个真实的反映，是有错误的。
    剧本中通过了顿得布这一人物的觉醒，企图说明内蒙人民经过了阶级觉悟，如事实的教训，消灭了反动统治阶级所造成的民族仇恨，而达到蒙汉人民的团结，但是由于剧本中没有接触到所以造成内蒙人民仇视汉人的历史的原因，是他们历年来饱受大汉族主义者欺压、排斥的切身经历所形成的，因之顿得布仇恨汉人的思想便没有他实际的根据，而在问题的解决上便也显得无力。
    由于对于内蒙人民革命的基本任务没有弄得明确，因而在影片中对于王爷这一人物的处理也是不恰当的，特别是代表着共产党的苏合同志对待王爷的态度，也是不符合共产党的民族政策的。我只看到了王公对人民的压迫，和少数民族中的败类通敌叛卖的事实，却忽视了在国民党反动派大汉族主义者的面前，这样的王公虽然与其本民族的人民大众之间有着矛盾，但是因为他们与国民党反动派之间也有矛盾，因此，在一定的条件之下，人民就有把这些上层分子争取过来或使之中立的可能。中国共产党的政策，就是争取这种可能的实现，对于少数民族中的上层分子，采取坚定的团结争取的方针。这种方针的目的，是为了集中力量打击帝国主义与国民党反动派，并为了消灭国民党反动派所造成的民族仇恨，实现民族的团结和各民族的解放。实际的事例，以抗战时期所发生的伊盟事件为例，国民党大汉族主义者的军队，侵占了沙王府，抢劫了王府的全部财物，把沙王逼得无路可走。然而，在中国共产党正确的民族政策之下，沙王受到了中共中央和西北局的招待，在陕甘宁边区找到了安身之所，沙王身受感动，至死不说反共的话。即如在《内蒙春光》剧本中所反映的解放战争初期，东蒙一带一部分的反动上层分子，因为对于国民党的力量抱着幻想，不相信人民的力量，而有着通敌叛卖的行为，但是中国共产党对于东蒙的上层分子，包括这些曾经是反动的上层分子在内，还是吸收他们参加政府工作，对他们进行改造教育。而《内蒙春光》的剧本中却忽视了少数民族的上层分子在反对大汉族主义这一点上有被人民争取过来或保守中立的可能这一方面，把王爷表现成十分顽固，至死不悟，似乎这就是一般王爷的代表。更重要的是忽视了党的团结争取政策这一重要方面，以致在剧本第一场布赫政委交待任务时就完全没有提及对王公上层分子的争取工作，而以后在苏合与王公接触中也没有表现出对王公的仁至义尽的争取与团结，而处处表现了盛气凌人的傲慢的作风。这是由于剧本缺少政策思想的原故。
    虽然我在写作这个剧本时，也深感到关于民族问题的处理上要十分谨慎小心，但根据这次对人民政协共同纲领第六章的研究，对照着影片的内容，才深感到自己的认识与共同纲领中的民族政策，和人民政府对于民族问题上所采取的谨慎方针，是有着很大的距离。
    我将在对《内蒙春光》的修改工作中与干学伟同志一道尽力使它更真实更正确地反映我们民族政策执行过程中的历史的实际的情况，使这部影片在政策思想上提高一步。
