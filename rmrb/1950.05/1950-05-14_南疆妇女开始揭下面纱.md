Southern Xinjiang Women Begin to Remove Their Veils

    At the People's Representative Conference of all ethnic groups in Kashgar (i.e., Shufu) City in southern Xinjiang in February this year, women representatives broke through the shackles of thousands of years of feudal tradition and loudly shouted for the first time: "Remove the veil, freedom of marriage!" Now many women have taken off the veils they used to wear in all seasons, and local feudal rulers no longer dare to ride horses and wield whips to whip them.
    For many years, women in southern Xinjiang, especially Uyghur women, have lived a prison-like life behind this veil. They have no freedom of marriage, person, or education. In terms of marriage, early marriage and polygamy are prevalent here. Twelve-year-old girls, not yet fully developed, leave home to marry. Girls of fourteen or fifteen are already mothers holding babies. The phenomenon of old men marrying young women is also very common, with many people in their fifties and sixties often marrying twelve-year-old girls. Generally, the wealthy and privileged treat women as toys, marrying today and abandoning them tomorrow.
    Su Pi Hejia, a big landlord and Muslim Ishan sect Ahong in Kashgar City, used his privileges and witchcraft to oppress and deceive the people, especially to trample on women in every possible way. Ibrahim Sirson, director of Kashgar Middle School, said: "Su Pi Hejia's marriages and divorces are like jokes. He is only thirty years old and has married at least one hundred and fifty wives. He doesn't spend money to marry wives, and using his status as a Hejia (descendant of the Prophet), no one dares to disobey, and they have to send their daughters to him. No one dares to marry the women he has divorced." An old water carrier, Maimaitiming, said: "Su Pi Hejia marries wives like drinking cold water. Every now and then, you hear about him 'grabbing a yangge' (getting married) or 'yangdu' (divorcing). A woman named Baier Gezi Han, who was abandoned by Su Pi Hejia, recounted her experience with hatred: "In 1945, Su Pi Hejia wanted to marry me. My brother said, 'Su Pi Hejia marries women like riding other people's horses in the horse market. He doesn't spend money or take responsibility, and in the end, he abandons them.' I didn't want to marry either. Su Pi Hejia asked the matchmaker Ze Naifu Han to relay his words: 'I am a saint. If she doesn't marry me, I will curse him (referring to the girl's father) to death; curse him to be poor and unable to make a fortune; curse her to be lame, blind, and no one will want her for the rest of her life.' My father was afraid, so he agreed. Six months after the marriage, one day he said to me: 'Your term is up. Take a leave, I approve your leave, go back.' I bowed deeply to him and said, 'Thank you, Hejia.' All the women who married him were like this: if he wanted to marry, they dared not refuse; if he wanted to divorce, they had to leave, and they had to thank him and dared not say anything to others."
    Women's lives after marriage are even more painful and unfree. After Nuer Nishahan married Aimaidi Boke Aji, the township chief of Pishan County, her husband often invited the women in the village to his house to play musical instruments, and sometimes they would stay overnight. The next day, she had to boil bathwater for them, and a slight delay would result in a slap in the face. The most barbaric thing is the so-called "Yaobashi," which is a condition put forward by the man before marriage, forbidding the woman from meeting men over the age of twelve. Su Pi Hejia would lock his wives in dark rooms every morning, not allowing them to know about his family affairs, nor allowing them to meet any men outside. In addition to this, the wife had to serve her husband's meals, and could only eat his leftovers after he had finished eating. The wife could not walk side by side with her husband on the street, but always had to follow him a few steps behind.
    Because women are so oppressed, they have very little opportunity to receive education. In Shufu County, there are a total of 126,450 women. According to statistics from local cultural and educational institutions at the beginning of this year, the situation of education is: only 130 female students in secondary schools, and only 3,938 female students in primary schools, and more than 97% are illiterate. This is the situation in Kashgar, which is known as the cultural center of southern Xinjiang. The situation in other places can be imagined.
    Since the liberation of Xinjiang, the vast number of female compatriots have begun to embark on a bright and happy road. The fourth item of the policy guidelines recently issued by the Xinjiang Provincial People's Government clearly stipulates: "Women enjoy equal rights with men, and freedom of marriage is practiced." Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, women of all ethnic groups have organized their own democratic women's federations and are fighting for women's rights.

### 南疆妇女开始揭下面纱

　　南疆妇女开始揭下面纱
    今年二月间举行的南疆喀什噶尔（即疏附）市各族各界人民代表会议上，妇女代表们打破了几千年封建传统的桎梏，响亮地喊出第一声：“揭下面纱，婚姻自由”。现在很多妇女都已经揭下了过去不分冬夏都罩着的面纱，当地的封建统治者也已经不敢再骑马扬鞭，对她们实行鞭笞了。
    南疆的妇女，尤其是维吾尔族的妇女，多少年来一直在这一层面纱后过着牢狱一般的生活。她们没有婚姻、人身、教育的自由。在婚姻方面，这里盛行着早婚和多妻的陋习。十二岁的少女，还没有发育健全，便离家成婚。十四、五岁的女子，已是怀抱婴儿的母亲了。老夫少妻的现象也很普遍，许多五、六十岁的老年人，往往与十二岁的幼女成婚。一般富豪和特权者把妇女当作玩具，今日结婚，明日抛弃。
    喀什城内的大地主、穆斯满教依祥派阿訇苏皮禾加，利用他的特权和巫术，压迫和欺骗人民，尤其是百般地蹂躏妇女。喀什中学主任伊不拉英士尔逊说：“苏皮禾加的结婚和离婚，象开玩笑一样。他才三十岁，至少娶了一百五十个老婆。他娶老婆并不花钱，利用他禾加（圣裔）的地位，别人不敢违抗，就得把女子送去。他离了婚的女子，无人再敢娶。”挑水老头子买买提明说：“苏皮禾加娶老婆象喝凉水一样，隔三间二，不是听说他‘抓秧哥’（结婚），就是听说他‘洋度’（离婚）。曾遭苏皮禾加离弃的女子拜儿哥孜汉愤恨地叙述她的遭遇说：“一九四五年，苏皮禾加要娶我。我哥哥说：‘苏皮禾加娶女人如同到马市上骑别人的马一样，既不出钱，又不负责，结果是抛弃。’我也不想嫁。苏皮禾加就叫媒婆则那甫汉转告他的话说：‘我是圣人，她若不嫁我，我念咒把他（指女父）咒死；念穷，叫他发不了财。念的叫她跛了，瞎了，一辈子没有人要她。’我父亲害怕，就许了他。结婚后六个月，有一天他对我说：‘你的期满了，你请假吧，我准你的假，你回去吧。’我向他深深的鞠躬，同时说：‘谢谢禾加。’同他结婚的女子都是：他要娶，不敢不去；他要离，不得不走，还得谢他，不敢向别人说什么话。”
    妇女在婚后的生活更是痛苦和不自由的。奴尔尼沙汉与皮山县乡长艾买提伯克阿吉结婚后，她的丈夫时常将村里的女人招引到家中弹弦作乐，有时还留宿。次日得给他们烧洗澡水，稍有迟慢就是一耳光。还有最野蛮的是所谓“耀把什”，这就是婚前男方提出条件，不准妇女与十二岁以上的男子见面。苏皮禾加每天早起就将他的妻子们锁进黑屋子里，不让她们知道他的家庭里的事，也不让她们和外面的任何男子见面。除此以外，做妻子的还要伺候丈夫吃饭，等丈夫吃完后才能吃他的残汤剩饭。妻子不能跟丈夫并肩在街上走，总要跟在他后面几步。
    妇女既是这样受压迫，因此女子受教育的机会就很少。疏附县共有妇女十二万六千四百五十人，据本年初当地文化教育机关统计，受教育的情况是：中等学校仅有一百三十名女生，小学校也仅有三千九百三十八名女生，其余百分之九十七以上都是文盲。这是号称南疆文化中心的喀什的情形，其他各地情况就可想而知了。
    新疆解放后，广大的妇女同胞们开始走上了光明幸福的道路。新疆省人民政府最近发布的施政方针第四项中明确规定：“妇女与男子享有平等的权利，实行婚姻自由。”在中国共产党领导下，各族各界妇女组织了自己的民主妇女联合会，正为着妇女的权利而奋斗。
