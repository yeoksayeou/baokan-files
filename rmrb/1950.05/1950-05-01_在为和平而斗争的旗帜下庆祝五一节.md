　　Celebrating May Day Under the Banner of Struggle for Peace
    Viktorov
    Today is May 1st, a day to review the fighting strength of the world's laborers.

    This festival of proletarian solidarity is becoming more glorious and joyful year by year, because the powerful camp of peace, democracy, and socialism, headed by the great Soviet Union, is expanding and consolidating year by year.

    We recall the May days of last year and all the past post-war years, when, after the heroic Soviet army smashed the Hitlerite bandits and won the historic victory over German fascism, the sun of freedom shone upon the heads of many nations in Europe, nations liberated from Hitler's enslavement and freed from the shackles of any imperialist oppression and enslavement.

    Not only the peoples of the Soviet Union celebrated May Day freely and joyfully, but also the people's democracies. This year, the great Chinese people, having overcome the Kuomintang reactionaries and imperialist intervention and achieved a historic victory, are also celebrating May Day freely and joyfully.

    The German Democratic Republic, which was born completely contrary to the intentions and conspiracies of British and American imperialism, is also freely celebrating May Day this year.

    Regardless of the police terror, the tyranny of suppression, and the special and extraordinary decrees and measures taken by the governments of various countries that have embarked on the path of the Anglo-American bloc, the laborers of various capitalist countries are greeting May Day with particularly high spirits, because for them, this is a festival of confidence in defeating the dark reactionary forces and the camp of instigators of new wars.

    The victorious construction of communism in the Soviet Union, the great achievements and accomplishments made by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party and the great leader Stalin, beloved by the world's laborers, and the smooth and tireless advance of the people's democracies along the path of socialism – all of these powerfully demonstrate the decisive superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, a system that is doomed to die, utterly corrupt, divided by extremely sharp internal contradictions, besieged by crises, and shaken to its foundations.

    The world of democracy and socialism knows neither crisis nor the terror of unemployment. The national economy of the Soviet Union is growing and consolidating year after year, the material well-being of the laborers is constantly improving, and culture is reaching unprecedented prosperity, with science and art flourishing. The people's democracies are also following this same path.

    In the imperialist camp, precisely the opposite is true. In the richest capitalist country – the United States – there are nearly eighteen million unemployed and semi-unemployed people, the living standards of the broad masses of the people are constantly declining, and the economic crisis is becoming increasingly acute. As for the Marshallized countries that have suffered from the double bondage of the United States – the "Marshall Plan" and the North Atlantic Treaty – and have lost their political and economic independence, there is no need to mention them!

    The heads of the imperialist world, the blood-sucking spiders of Wall Street, are eager to dominate the world and are committed to maintaining their staggering excess profits, but they do not believe in tomorrow. So they resort to organizing new military adventures and preparing for a new world war. They are stirring up war hysteria and war madness, brandishing atomic bombs in an attempt to intimidate the world, and pursuing a policy of aggression and instigation of war. This policy is concretely manifested in the frantic arms race, the frenzied construction of military bases, the formation of aggressive blocs, and the abandonment of international obligations to organize peaceful control. They are striving to make Germany and Japan new bases for aggression again.

    The increasingly expanding and consolidating powerful front of peace is confronting the imperialist reactionary camp, the camp of war instigators. The movement for peace has spread to all countries and continents. The people of all countries do not want war, they want peace, and they are ready to wage a decisive struggle to suppress the evil war instigators and to protect their homes from the ravages of war and their children from the harm of bombs.

    The struggle for peace is marked by the banner of the great Soviet Union, and the struggle for peace is also marked by the banners of the people's democracies, the People's Republic of China, and the German Democratic Republic. The millions of people participating in the nationwide movement for peace, regardless of their nationality or their political and religious views, have united under the banner of the struggle for peace.

    The whole world is celebrating May Day under the banner of the struggle for peace. This is not only a review of the fighting strength of the laborers, but also a review of the strength of the struggle for peace and for the security of all nations.

    The struggle for peace has entered a new stage. It has not only acquired new and more active forms, such as the refusal of dockworkers in France and the Netherlands to unload weapons provided by the United States to Marshallized countries. Moreover, this struggle now has a concrete task as its banner, a task stipulated in the appeal unanimously adopted by the Third Session of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. This appeal demands the unconditional prohibition of the use of atomic weapons, and declares that the first government to use atomic weapons against any other country is a war criminal.

    The signature campaign responding to the Standing Committee's call for the prohibition of atomic weapons is now underway. This great vote by the people of the world is a serious warning to the war instigators. It illustrates the growing solidarity of peace advocates and their unwavering determination to crush the evil conspiracies of the imperialists.

    Today, on May Day, the laborers of the world are demonstrating their will to strive for peace. Today, on May Day, they are vowing to persevere in this struggle until the aggressors, who are preparing to subject the nations to new and infinite disasters and sufferings for the benefit of a small group of imperialist robbers, are suppressed.

    The forces of peace and democracy far outweigh the forces of reaction and the forces of war instigators. The peace front is growing and consolidating. May Day, this festival of solidarity of the world's laborers, is a new and powerful stimulus for uniting all true peace advocates and for strengthening the struggle for peace.

    The evil plans of the war instigators must be crushed.

    Peace will triumph over war!

### 在为和平而斗争的旗帜下庆祝五一节

　　在为和平而斗争的旗帜下庆祝五一节
    维克托洛夫
    今天是五月一日，是检阅全世界劳动者战斗力量的日子。
    这个无产阶级团结的节日，一年比一年更加光辉、更加欢乐，因为以伟大的苏联为首的强大的和平、民主和社会主义阵营正在一年比一年地扩大和巩固着。
    我们记起去年、所有过去战后年份中五月的日子，那时，在英勇的苏联军队粉碎了希特勒匪军获得了对德国法西斯主义的历史性的胜利以后，自由的太阳照耀在欧洲的许多民族的顶上，这些民族从希特勒的奴役中解放了出来，摆脱了任何帝国主义的压迫和奴役的枷锁。
    不仅苏联各民族曾经自由地和欢乐地庆祝了五一节，就是在各人民民主国家里也是如此。在今年，已经战胜了国民党反动派和帝国主义干涉，获得了历史性胜利的伟大中国人民，同样也正在自由地和欢乐地庆祝着五一节。
    和英美帝国主义的意图与阴谋完全相反而诞生了的德意志民主共和国，在今年也自由地庆祝着五一节。
    不顾警察的恐怖、镇压的横暴，不顾走上英美集团轨道的各国政府所采取的特别的、非常的法令及措置，各资本主义国家的劳动者们都怀着特别高涨的情绪来迎接五一节，因为对他们来说，这是战胜黑暗反动势力、战胜新战争挑拨者阵营的信心的节日。
    共产主义在苏联胜利的建设，苏维埃人民在布尔什维克党与伟大的、全世界劳动者敬爱的领袖斯大林领导之下所实现的巨大的成就和业绩，以及各人民民主国家顺利地、不倦地沿着社会主义的道路前进——所有这些都以巨大的力量证明：社会主义制度较资本主义制度具有决定意义的优越性，而资本主义制度是注定要死亡的、腐败透顶、为极尖锐的内部矛盾所分裂、为危机所笼罩，动摇到根基的一种制度。
    民主和社会主义的世界不知道危机，也不知道失业的恐怖。苏联的国民经济在年复一年地增长着、巩固着，劳动者的物质福利在不断地提高着，文化达到前所未见的繁盛，科学和艺术都是欣欣向荣。各人民民主国家也都走着这条同样的道路。
    在帝国主义阵营里恰是完全相反的情景。在最富有的资本主义国家——美国内，失业者和半失业者将近一千八百万人，广大人民群众的生活水平在不断地降低，经济危机日益显得尖锐。至于那些遭受美国的两重束缚——“马歇尔计划”和北大西洋公约——丧失了自己政治上和经济上的独立的马歇尔化国家，更是不必说了！
    帝国主义世界的头子们，华尔街吸血的蜘蛛们，他们渴望着统治世界，致力于保持自己惊人的超额利润，但是他们不相信明天。于是他们就求助于组织新的军事冒险，求助于准备新的世界大战。他们煽动着战争的狂热病，战争的歇斯的里，他们挥舞着原子炸弹，企图恫吓世界，他们奉行着侵略和挑拨战争的政策。这政策具体地表现在疯狂的军备竞赛上，军事基地狂热的建设上，侵略集团的纠合上，以及对于自己的组织和平管制的国际义务的背弃上。他们努力欲使德国和日本重新成为新的侵略基地。
    日益扩大并巩固的、强大的和平战线对抗着帝国主义反动阵营，战争挑拨者阵营。争取和平的运动普及到了所有的国家和大陆。各国人民不要战争，他们要和平，并且已准备好作决定性的斗争，借以镇压罪恶的战争挑拨者们，以保卫自己的家园不受战争的破坏，自己的孩子们不受炸弹的伤害。
    争取和平的斗争标明在伟大苏联的旗帜上，争取和平的斗争亦标明在各人民民主国家、中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国的旗帜上。参加争取和平全民运动的千百万人们，不论他们属于那一个民族以及政治上和宗教上的见解如何，都已团结在为和平而斗争的旗帜下。
    在为和平而斗争的旗帜下全世界庆祝着五一节。这不止是劳动者战斗力量的检阅，而且是为和平、为各民族的安全而斗争的力量的检阅。
    争取和平的斗争已进入了一个新的阶段。它不仅仅获得了新的、更积极的形式，例如法国和荷兰的搬运工人拒绝卸运美国给予马歇尔化国家的武器。而且这一斗争，现在还有了具体的任务作为标帜，这一任务规定在全世界保卫和平大会常设委员会第三次常会所一致通过的呼吁书中。这呼吁书要求无条件地禁止使用原子武器，并宣布第一个使用原子武器来对付任何其它国家的政府就是战争罪犯。
    现在响应常设委员会号召要求禁止原子武器的签名运动正在进行着。全世界人民的这一伟大投票，是对战争挑拨者的一个严重警告。它说明了和平拥护者日益增长的团结，以及他们粉碎帝国主义者罪恶阴谋的不屈不挠的决心。
    今天，在五一节，全世界劳动者都表明自己争取和平的意志。今天，在五一节，他们宣誓坚持这个斗争，一直到侵略者们被镇压住为止。这些侵略者们为了一小撮帝国主义强盗的利益而准备使各民族蒙受新的、无限的灾厄和苦难。
    和平民主的力量大大地超过了反动派的力量与战争挑拨者的力量。和平阵线正在壮大和巩固着。五一节，这一全世界劳动者团结的节日，对于团结所有真正的和平拥护者、对于争取和平的斗争的加强正是一个新的、强有力的刺激。
    战争挑拨者们的罪恶计划必被粉碎。
    和平必将战胜战争！
