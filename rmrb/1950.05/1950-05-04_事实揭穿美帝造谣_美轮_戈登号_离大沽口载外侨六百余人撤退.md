Facts Expose American Imperialist Rumors
American Ship "Gordon" Departs from Dagukou with Over 600 Foreign Nationals Evacuated
[Xinhua News Agency, 3rd] The American merchant ship "Gordon," evacuating American and other foreign nationals, departed from Dagukou on the morning of April 30th. The ship carried a total of 690 foreign nationals: including 145 American citizens, of whom 99 were former American embassy and consulate personnel in Nanjing and Shanghai and their families; 66 British citizens; 80 German citizens; 27 French citizens; 14 Italian citizens; 23 Austrian citizens; 166 stateless persons; and 169 others. Among these expatriates, 180 were sent by the United Nations Refugee Organization.

Although the American government announced as early as January of this year that it would recall all of its "official personnel" stationed in our country, it has repeatedly delayed its actions. The US State Department vainly attempted to smear our People's Government for making it difficult for foreign nationals to evacuate, but its conspiracies have been repeatedly exposed by our factual accounts. Foreign nationals returning home could have boarded ships near Shanghai, but the US government, using the so-called rumors it spread about the Kuomintang reactionaries laying mines in Shanghai's ports, prevented the "Gordon" from entering Shanghai harbor. Consequently, foreign nationals successively traveled by train from Shanghai and Nanjing to Tianjin's Tanggu, and then boarded the "Gordon."

　　事实揭穿美帝造谣
    美轮“戈登号”离大沽口载外侨六百余人撤退
    【新华社三日讯】撤退美侨及其它外国侨民的美国商船“戈登号”，已于四月三十日晨离大沽口。该轮共载外侨六百九十人：计美国籍一百四十五人，内有南京及上海前美国使领馆人员及其家属九十九人；英国籍六十六人；德国籍八十人；法国籍二十七人；意大利籍十四人；奥国籍二十三人；无国籍者一百六十六人；其它一百六十九人。这些侨民中有一百八十人为联合国难民组织所遣送者。
    按美国政府虽然自本年一月间即宣布召回其所有驻我国的“官方人员”，但在行动上却一再拖延。美国国务院妄图污蔑我人民政府留难外侨的撤退，但是它的阴谋诡计迭次被我国据实揭穿。离华回国的侨民本可在上海就近登轮，因美政府借口其自己所散布的所谓国民党反动派在上海港口布雷的谣言，不让“戈登号”进入上海港，外侨遂陆续自上海、南京乘火车赴天津转塘沽再登“戈登”轮。
