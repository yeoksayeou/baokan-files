	Changping District Party Secretary's Beating Incident
	County Party Committee Reports on Handling Results

To the Editor:

Regarding the incident of Li Yongtang, the Party Secretary of the Third District of Changping, beating people because he did not carefully consider the opinions of the masses, as published in the People's Daily on May 16th, we had already discovered this matter and immediately conducted an investigation and understanding before seeing the newspaper's report. After receiving your newspaper's letter, which further emphasized the importance we should attach to this issue, we immediately dispatched capable cadres to the location of the incident for a detailed investigation and understanding. We have now clarified the facts. Except for a slight discrepancy in the number of people beaten (the newspaper reported five people were beaten, but in reality, there were only three), everything else is entirely consistent with the facts. We believe that such an extremely bad bureaucratic style of Li Yongtang, who does not humbly consider the opinions of the masses, suppresses democracy, and beats people arbitrarily, seriously damages the political prestige of the Party. This shows that our leadership's prior education of Party members and cadres was insufficient, and we failed to effectively implement policies and laws into the actions of every cadre, resulting in the failure to completely eliminate the cadre's style of beating and detaining people. In addition to conducting a profound self-criticism and carrying out education within the Party, we have also proposed to the higher Party committee to give Li Yongtang the punishment of removal from office and probation within the Party, and urge him to thoroughly reflect on himself, apologize to the masses, and admit his mistakes. Zhao Junying, the head of the police station (member of the District Party Committee), not only failed to stop the arbitrary detention of people but also cooperated with the District Party Committee in detaining people. It is proposed to give him a public warning within the Party. It is also recommended that the government promptly investigate the village chief's corruption problem to respond to the demands of the masses.

　　昌平区书打人事件
    县委报告处理结果编辑同志：
    五月十六日人民日报登载昌平三区区委书记李永堂不细心考虑群众意见，竟动手打人一事。我们在未见到报纸披露之前，已发觉此事，当即进行调查了解。后又接到贵报来信，更提起我们对此问题的重视，当即派得力干部亲赴肇事地点详细调查了解。现已将事实弄清。除打人一事稍有出入外（报上登载被打的五人，实际上只有三人），其他完全和事实相符。我们认为，像李永堂这样不虚心考虑群众意见、压制民主、蛮横打人的极端恶劣的官僚主义作风，严重地损害了党的政治威信。这说明我们领导上事先在党员干部中进行教育不够，未能切实把政策法令贯彻到每一干部的行动中去，致使干部打人、扣人作风未能彻底肃清。我们除作深刻的检讨，在党内进行教育外，并向上级党委提议，给李永堂以撤职和留党察看的处分，并促其彻底进行反省，向群众道歉，承认错误。派出所长赵俊英（区委委员）对于随意扣人的行为，不但未加制止，而且协同区委扣人，亦拟给以党内当众警告的处分。并建议政府从速清查该村村长贪污问题，以答复群众的要求。
