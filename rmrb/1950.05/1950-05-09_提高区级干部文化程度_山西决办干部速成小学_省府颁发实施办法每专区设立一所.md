To Improve the Cultural Level of District-Level Cadres
	Shanxi Decides to Establish Cadre Fast-Track Elementary Schools
	Provincial Government Promulgates Implementation Measures, One to Be Established in Each Special District

	[This Newspaper Despatch] Shanxi Province recently decided to establish cadre fast-track elementary schools to improve the cultural level of in-service worker-peasant cadres at the district level (including diligent workers who have been working for more than three years and have prospects for development). The Shanxi Provincial People's Government promulgated the "Draft Implementation Measures for Cadre Fast-Track Elementary Schools in Shanxi Province" on April 25. The measures stipulate that the educational content of cadre fast-track elementary schools should focus on improving culture, supplemented by a certain amount of current affairs and policy education. The school system is divided into primary and advanced levels, each with a study period of one and a half years, with each half-year being a semester. Each level is divided into classes according to proficiency. Generally, each class is limited to 50 people, and classes with fewer than 30 people are not allowed to be opened. Cadre fast-track elementary schools must implement planned teaching in accordance with the guidelines and requirements and the students' proficiency, and establish regular systems such as examinations, promotions, retentions, and transfers. The class arrangement method is mainly based on the level of Chinese language and general political knowledge. If the level of Chinese language proficiency is not compatible with the level of arithmetic proficiency, they can be arranged into different levels or classes (such as Chinese language at the advanced level and arithmetic at the primary level, or at the same level but in different classes). Chinese language and arithmetic textbooks adopt spare-time supplementary textbooks or literacy textbooks for people's schools; general knowledge textbooks are uniformly stipulated by the Department of Culture and Education. Before the textbooks are issued, textbooks for senior primary schools and junior primary schools can be used for compressed adaptation, so that the primary class reaches the general level of graduation from junior primary school, and the advanced class reaches the level of graduation from senior primary school. The weekly class hours and self-study hours are both 24 hours; the number of class weeks per semester shall not be less than 23 weeks. The principle is not to have winter and summer vacations; if it is necessary to have vacations, the special commissioner's office shall decide at its discretion. Graduates of each level must pass all course examinations before being issued a graduation certificate; if one course fails, they are allowed to temporarily graduate, continue to study in their work, and may apply for a make-up examination within one year. If they pass the make-up examination, a graduation certificate will be issued; if two courses fail, they will remain in the same grade to continue learning.
	The admission requirements for students stipulate that they must be cadres at the district level for more than one year, in principle under the age of 35, in good health, and have prospects for development. Once admitted, they cannot be transferred midway before graduation; if necessary or suffering from a serious illness, they may suspend their studies with the approval of the special commissioner's office. Transfers must be submitted to the provincial government for approval. If the special commissioner's office deems it necessary and possible for those who have suspended their studies, they may be ordered to resume their studies.
