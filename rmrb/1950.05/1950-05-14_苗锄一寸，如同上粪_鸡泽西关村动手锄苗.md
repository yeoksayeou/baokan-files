　　"Hoeing Seedlings an Inch is Like Applying Fertilizer"
　　Xiguan Village, Jize, Takes Action to Hoe Seedlings
    [Report from this newspaper in Handan] After completing sowing and wheat hoeing, farmers in Xiguan Village, Jize County, Hebei Province, have begun hoeing small seedlings. The sorghum planted in mid-April before the rainfall has sprouted to a height of two inches. "Hoeing seedlings an inch is like applying fertilizer." In order to make the seedlings grow vigorously, remove weeds and thin out the seedlings as early as possible, the farmers immediately took action to hoe the seedlings. As of now, 300 mu of sorghum have been hoed once. Farmer Wu Bingwen, who planted three mu of sorghum, has finished hoeing all of it. He said, "There are benefits to weeding at this time: first, without weeds, the seedlings grow vigorously; second, it saves effort when thinning the seedlings because there are no weeds in the field. The work is getting busier day by day, so you have to start early rather than late." Feng Man's ten mu of sorghum, two mu have been hoed, and he is striving to finish hoeing the seedlings in five days.

　　“苗锄一寸，如同上粪”
　　鸡泽西关村动手锄苗
    【本报邯郸讯】河北省鸡泽县西关村农民在完成播种、锄麦后，已开始锄小苗。该村在四月中旬降雨前播种之高粱，已出土有二寸高。“苗锄一寸，如同上粪”，为了使苗子长旺，及早去草开苗，农民们即动手锄苗，截至目前为止，已有三百亩高粱普锄一遍。如农民吴炳文种的三亩高粱已全部锄完，他说：“这时锄草有好处：第一是没了草，苗子长得旺；第二是地里没草开苗时就省了工夫。活是一天比一天忙，要赶早别赶晚。”冯满囤种得十亩高粱，已锄过的有二亩，争取五天把苗锄完。
