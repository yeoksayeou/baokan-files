To the Tax Q&A Editor:

　　If goods have already been taxed, but the tax certificate is lost due to the passage of time, but all tax stamps affixed to the original goods are complete, should the tax be levied again?

　　When selling goods outside, business tax is levied locally. When the sales amount is returned to the store and recorded together, 영업세 (business tax) and 소득세 (income tax) are levied again in the store's location. Isn't this double taxation? If business tax is levied outside, and the original procedures are brought back to the original location, can it offset the business tax and income tax? Please answer.

Reply to Mr. Zhang Jincai:

　　1. If the tax certificate for taxed goods is lost, but the tax stamps and inspection certificates affixed to the goods are complete, and if it involves a large quantity of goods, you can report it to the local tax authority. Permission will still be granted for free sale in the local area without the need to re-tax.

　　2. When a stationary merchant sells goods outside and pays business tax at the place of sale, the tax already paid should, in principle, be deducted when industrial and commercial tax is levied locally. However, separate accounts must be kept, and the original proof of business tax payment must be brought back. After verification, it can be deducted or taken into consideration when checking accounts and calculating taxes or during democratic appraisal.

To the Editor:

　　We have established a workers' welfare society. Its main task is to guarantee the workers' wages in kind. Therefore, the number of items sold is not large, including rice, flour, salt, soap, towels, and cloth. Our welfare society does not sell goods to the public; it only sells to workers. It is right for us to pay tax when we buy grain from the market. But we have to pay tax when we give the grain to the people to grind into flour, and the people have to pay tax when they deliver the ground flour to us, and the workers have to pay tax when they buy flour from us. We paid tax when we bought the cloth, and after it was stored in our warehouse for a period of time, we were taxed again on the entire amount. We feel this is somewhat unreasonable. Please tell us which of these taxes should be paid and which should not.

Reply to Comrade He Ful:

　　1. If the welfare society does not engage in commercial activities and does not operate externally, but only collects money from everyone to buy things and distribute them to everyone, then it does not need to pay tax.

　　2. Grain is a taxable commodity for transaction tax. It is correct for the buyer to pay transaction tax when buying grain through the market.

　　3. Giving grain to the people to grind into flour is only processing in nature and is not taxed. If it is barter, it is a business activity, and both parties should pay tax. When the people deliver the ground flour to the processing client, the flour itself is not taxed, but the handling fee obtained by the people should be taxed if it is a regular business. Flour ground for self-use is not taxed. If it is sold to the outside world again and there is a commercial profit, then of course it must be taxed.

　　4. If the cloth stored in the warehouse is taken out after a period of time and is for self-use, it is not taxed. Otherwise, if it is sold without the original tax ticket, then tax must be supplemented (this does not apply to homespun cloth).

　　税务问答编辑同志：
    已经征过税的货物，因为时间过久，将完税证遗失了，但贴在原货物上的一切税证都很齐全，这样是否还要重行征税？
    在外出售货物时，当地征了行商税，回到本店将推销货物额一同走账，但在本店所在地又按账征收营业税与所得税，这样不是重征了吗？究竟在外征了行商税，将原手续带回原住地，是否能顶营业税与所得税呢？请予解答。
                          山西省榆次城张晋才张晋才君：
    一、已税货物完税照遗失，而货件上所贴完税证、查验证齐全，如系大宗货物时，可向当地税务机关报明，仍准在本地自由销售，不需重新课税。
    二、座商在外销货时，在销货地征了行商税，在本地课征工商业税时，原则上应将已纳之税扣除，但必须单独立账，并需将原有完纳行商税证明带回，经审核属实后，在查账计税或民主评议时可以扣除或照顾。
         编者编辑同志：
    我们自己办了一个工人福利社，它的主要任务是保证职工的实物工资，所以卖的东西样数也不多，有米、面、盐、肥皂、手巾、布。我们这个福利社并不对外出售货品，只卖给工人。我们从市场上买粮食上税，这是应该的。但我们把粮食交给老百姓磨面要上税，老乡磨好面交给我们的时候也要上税，工人到我们这里买面的时候又要上税。我们买的布，买时已上了税，放到我们仓库里，过了一个时期，又让我们全部重上了一次税。我们觉得有些不合理。究竟这些税那些该上那些不该上，请你们给以答复。
                    河北总工会产业办事处和福利和福利同志：
    一、福利社如果没有商业行为，也不对外营业，只是集合大家的钱，买来东西再配给大家，这样是不必纳税的。
    二、粮食是交易税的应税货品，通过市场买粮食，由买方完纳交易税，这是对的。
    三、把粮食交给老百姓磨面，只是加工性质的，不课税；如果是以物易物，即系营业行为，双方都应纳税。老百姓把面磨好交给委托加工的人，面本身不征税，但老百姓所得手续费部分如系经常营业的要征税；磨下的面供自用不纳税，如果再向外边销售时，有商业利润，当然就要纳税。
    四、仓库里存的布，过了一个时期拿出来，如果不卖而系自用者不课税，否则出卖时，没有原来税票，那就要补税（土布不在此限）。
