　　Changzhi Special District Inspects Public Grain Storage
　　Handan Special Commissioner's Office Resolves to Establish Grain Protection Organizations at All Levels

　　[Report from our Taiyuan correspondent] The Changzhi Special District Grain Depot, in a meeting at the beginning of April to inspect grain storage work in various sub-depots, discovered that in many places, public grain was heating up, infested with insects, rotting, and being stolen. The main reason was that cadres did not pay enough attention to grain storage and were ideologically numb. For example, the Licun Gou Grain Depot in Lucheng had long discovered that the grain had moldy signs, but still said, "It's nothing, just the ground is a bit damp." As a result, of the more than 227,100 jin of millet stored in 1948, nearly 5,000 jin rotted into black lumps and grew white hair, and the rest all had a sour taste. In some cases, attention was paid to external theft, but internal theft was ignored. For example, the Lucheng County Lujiazhuang and Gaoping County Sizhuang sub-depots discovered cases of landlords and militiamen stealing grain from within the grain depot yard.

　　Secondly, leaders were not proactive or thorough enough in inspecting the work and therefore could not discover problems in time. For example, the grain theft in Xiangyuan County's Huting sub-depot and the shortage of more than 3,000 jin of grain in Changzhi County's Zhan Shang sub-depot were not discovered in time. Based on the above situation, the Special District Grain Depot requested that cadres in various places clarify that doing a good job in grain storage is a serious political task. And deployed a comprehensive inspection and key inventory work. After the meeting, cadres in various sub-depots had a preliminary change in their thinking on storage work. For example, the Anyang sub-depot in Lucheng County, after a landlord theft occurred on April 14, it was discovered in time and sent to the district for processing.

　　[Report from our Handan correspondent] The Handan Special Commissioner's Office, in view of the fact that as many as 24 theft cases have occurred in the eight sub-grain depots and twenty-three sub-depots of Ci County, Wei County, Daming, Linzhang, Feixiang, Handan, She County, and Wu'an, has decided to establish grain protection committees at all levels, with the heads of Party, government, military, and relevant departments as members, in order to avoid the same incidents from happening in the future. And establish various systems to ensure that public grain will no longer suffer losses in the future.

### 长治专区检查公粮保管　邯郸专署决设各级护粮机构

　　长治专区检查公粮保管
　　邯郸专署决设各级护粮机构
    【本报太原讯】长治专区粮库在四月初召开各分库检查粮食保管工作会议中，发现各地有不少公粮发热，生虫，腐烂，被盗事件，主要是由于干部对粮食保管不重视，思想很麻痹。如潞城李村沟粮库早已发现粮食有霉坏现象，但仍说：“没有啥，只是地有点潮”。结果使原存一九四八年小米二二七、一○○余斤中烂成黑块及长白毛的近五千斤，其余全部有酸味。有的是由于注意了外盗，却忽视了内盗，如长治县鹿家庄、高平县寺庄代库发现房东与粮库院内民兵盗粮的事情。
    其次是由于领导上检查工作不主动不深入。因而不能即时发现问题。如襄垣县俿亭代库粮被盗，长治县湛上代库粮亏空三千多斤，都未即时发现。根据以上情况，专区粮库提出要求各地干部明确做好粮食保管工作是一个严重的政治任务。并布置了普遍检查、重点清仓的工作。会后，各分库干部对保管工作，在思想上已有了初步的改变。如潞城县安阳代库，于四月十四日发生房东盗粮事件，即被及时查出，送区处理。

    【本报邯郸讯】邯郸专署因鉴于磁县、魏县、大名、临漳、肥乡、邯郸、涉县、武安等八个分粮库，二十三个代库，曾先后发生被盗案件达二十四起之多，今后为避免同样事件发生，决定成立各级护粮委员会，由各级党、政、军及有关部门负责人为委员。并建立各种制度，保证今后公粮不再遭受损失。
