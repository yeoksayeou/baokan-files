    Lian Fugui and Chang Jingbo, foremen at the Linxi Kailuan Machinery Factory, successfully created an eight-tooth gear. This component is a crucial part of the electric locomotive used in coal mines, and its consumption is extremely high. In the past, expensive British-made parts were used. After repeated research, the two men produced a product that performs as well as the British-made one. The efficiency of the tooth-washing work has now increased sixfold compared to the beginning.
    Wang Xizhou, a worker at the Kailuan Zhao Mine, with the help of veteran worker Pan Guangli and others, successfully created an electric horizontal lapping machine, saving more than seventy work hours for each cylinder lapped.
