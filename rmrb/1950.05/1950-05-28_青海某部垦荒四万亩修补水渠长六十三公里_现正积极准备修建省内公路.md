Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 25th. A certain unit of the Qinghai Military Region garrison has initially completed the work of reclaiming land for cultivation and constructing water conservancy projects. The entire army is now actively preparing to undertake the new task of contracting and dividing sections to build provincial highways.

    By mid-April, the unit had reclaimed more than 43,000 mu of land and planted more than 3,800 mu of vegetables, which is expected to yield more than 7.6 million jin of vegetables. In terms of water conservancy projects, the unit repaired the Changsheng, Fanghui, Gegong, and Ping'an Canals, totaling 63 kilometers in length. In terms of animal husbandry, the unit raised 947 pigs and more than 820 sheep. The income from the transportation industry, calculated in wheat, totaled more than 11,500 shi. The income from handicraft production was more than 900 shi of wheat. More than 1,000 people participated in gold mining, with each person mining 3 to 5 li of gold per day. Workshop production can generate more than 260 shi of wheat per month. In addition, from January to March, the unit saved more than 399,000 jin of flour and more than 347,000 jin of coal.

    Recently, after Chairman Peng Dehuai of the Northwest Military and Political Committee called on the unit to undertake the project of contracting and dividing sections to build provincial highways, all commanders and fighters responded enthusiastically. The unit's "Frontline Life" newspaper pointed out: Qinghai is rich in mineral resources and abounds in furs; salt production is particularly abundant; only when transportation is developed can the mining industry develop and trade between regions be connected. Building highways extensively can also strengthen the friendship and unity between all nationalities. The newspaper called on all commanders and fighters to answer Chairman Peng Dehuai's call with exemplary practical actions.

    现正积极准备修建省内公路
    【新华社兰州二十五日电】青海军区驻军某部已初步完成垦荒播种和兴修水利的工作，全军现正积极准备担负起包工分段修建省内公路的新任务。
    该部截至四月中旬止，共垦荒四万三千多亩，种菜三千八百余亩，预计可收菜七百六十余万斤。水利工程方面，该部修补了共长六十三公里的长胜、芳惠、阁公、平安等四渠。牧畜业方面，该部养猪九百四十七口、羊八百二十余只。运输业收入以小麦计，共一万一千五百多石。手工业生产收入小麦九百多石。采金生产有千余人参加，每人每天可采金三厘至五厘。作坊生产每月可收入小麦二百六十多石。此外，一月至三月间，该部并节约面粉三十九万九千多斤、煤炭三十四万七千多斤。
    最近西北军政委员会彭德怀主席号召该部担任包工分段修建省内公路的工程后，全体指战员均热烈响应。该部《前线生活》报指出：青海矿藏丰富，盛产皮毛，食盐产量尤其丰富；只有交通发达后，采矿事业才能发展，各地贸易才能沟通。广修公路同时可以加强各民族间的友谊和团结。该报号召全体指战员以模范的实际行动，来回答彭德怀主席的号召。
