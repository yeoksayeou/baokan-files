Two Letters to Shanghai Worker Brothers

Letter 1
Dear Shanghai Worker Brothers:

You have always been at the forefront of revolutionary struggle. Recently, the evils caused by the imperialist and Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's blockade and bombing have put some Shanghai worker brothers in a difficult situation. We express our deep concern and sympathy to you. The congress unanimously passed a resolution to support Shanghai worker brothers in overcoming their current difficulties with practical actions, calling on all employees under the jurisdiction of the sub-bureau to support Shanghai worker brothers with one day of voluntary labor on April 30th. At the same time, we will definitely implement the resolutions discussed at the congress into our actual work, guarantee the completion and surpassing of the transportation and engineering tasks of 1950, actively support the front, thoroughly eliminate the Chiang bandits as soon as possible, liberate Tibet, Hainan Island, and Taiwan, and strive to liberate all of China!

The "April 21st Advanced Workers Congress" of the Meihekou Sub-bureau of the Jilin Railway Administration

Letter 2
Shanghai Unemployed Worker Comrades:

We extend our heartfelt sympathy for your unemployment. We must step up production, do a good job on the people's railways, complete the tasks for 1950, support the People's Liberation War, quickly liberate Taiwan, liberate all of China, and finally, we are willing to respond to the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and each donate one day's salary to you to help you overcome your temporary difficulties.

The entire workforce of the Fengtai Train Depot
