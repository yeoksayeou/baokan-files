Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, 15th. Over the past year, Jilin City's industry and commerce have seen new and normal development, and workers' lives have also been stabilized and improved. From May of last year to now, the number of state-owned factories with more than 600 workers in the city has increased from two to six; the total number of workers in state-owned factories and enterprises (excluding railways) has increased from more than 5,000 to 14,000, almost tripling. Compared with last year, the number of private machine manufacturing, ironworking, textile, match, papermaking, chemical, wood farm implement, wula (leather boots of farmers in northern Manchuria), and white leather industries has increased by 11.7 percent, workers have increased by 4.8 percent, and capital has increased by 12.5 percent. In particular, the industries that supply farmers' needs, such as porcelain, mat, lime, and sacks, have developed particularly significantly. Among them, the number of households in the porcelain and mat industries has increased by 131.5 percent compared with last year, capital has increased by 188 percent, and workers and shop assistants have increased by 17.7 percent.

With the increasing frequency of urban and rural transactions following the development of production, commerce and cooperatives have also moved forward. The number of state-owned stores has increased by four compared with last year, the number of shop assistants has more than doubled, and the total sales value has increased from 24.633 billion yuan (Northeast currency, same below) to 86.6133 billion yuan. In the second quarter of this year, six new state-owned stores will be established in Jilin City. The number of cooperatives has also increased from 36 last year to 45 this year, and the number of members has increased from more than 25,000 to more than 41,000.

The development of production and construction in Jilin City is the result of overcoming the depression that occurred after liberation. In the first half of last year, due to the reduction of local military supply and military industrial processing, and the continuous arrival of industrial products from other newly liberated large cities in Jilin, some private industrial and commercial enterprises in Jilin experienced serious difficulties in production stagnation and sluggish sales; after the government promoted development in the direction of serving the countryside and the state-owned economy, the industries that adapted to the new supply and demand situation had normal development, and the lives of workers also became increasingly stable. At present, the actual wages of employees in state-owned and private factories in Jilin City have increased by an average of about 16 percent compared with last year.

　　吉林市生产日趋发展
    工人生活获得显著改善  商业、合作社大形增加
    【新华社吉林十五日电】过去一年来，吉林市工商业有了新的正常发展，工人生活亦得到了安定和改善。从去年五月到现在，全市六百人以上的公营工厂已由二个增加为六个；公营工厂、企业的工人总数（铁路除外）已由五千余人增加至一万四千人，几乎增加了三倍。私营的机器制造、铁工、纺织、火柴、造纸、化学、木农具、靰鞡（北满农民的皮靴）、白皮等行业与去年比较，家数共增加百分之十一点七，工人增加百分之四点八，资本增加百分之十二点五。特别是供应农民需要的行业，如瓷、席、石灰、麻袋等发展尤为显著。其中瓷、席两业户数比去年增加百分之一三一点五，资金增加百分之一八八，工人店员增加了百分之十七点七。
    随着生产发展后城乡交易的日趋频繁，商业、合作社也向前推进了一步。国营商店比去年增加了四处，店员增加了一倍以上，售货总值由二百四十六亿三百余万元（东北币，下同）增至八百六十六亿一千三百余万元。今年第二季中，吉林市将又有六处新的国营商店成立。合作社也由去年的三十六处发展为今年的四十五处，社员由二万五千余人发展为四万一千余人。
    吉林市生产建设的发展是战胜了解放后曾一度发生的萧条景象的结果。去年上半年，由于本地军需军工加工的减少，其他新解放大城市工业产品不断来吉等原因，吉林部分私营工商业发生了停产滞销的严重困难；以后经过政府推动向农村和为公营经济服务的方向发展，于是适应新的供需情况的行业便有了正常发展，工人生活也因此日趋安定。现在，吉林市各公私工厂职工的实际工资比去年平均增加了百分之十六左右。
