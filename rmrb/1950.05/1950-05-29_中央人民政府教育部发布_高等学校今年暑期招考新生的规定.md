Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government promulgated the regulations on the enrollment of new students in higher education institutions for the summer of 1950 on the 26th of this month. The full text is as follows:

In order to implement the spirit of the First National Education Work Conference, begin to systematically and step-by-step cultivate various specialized talents and construction cadres for New China, gradually correct the unreasonable state of enrollment in higher education institutions in the past, and reduce the difficulties for students applying for exams, the following provisions are made:

I. Higher education institutions referred to in these regulations refer to public and private universities, independent colleges, and specialized schools.

II. Regarding application qualifications: Anyone who volunteers to serve the people and is in good health and meets one of the following conditions may apply for the exam:

	1. Graduates of public or private senior high schools with graduation certificates or certificates of admission to higher education;

	2. Graduates of later-stage normal schools with graduation certificates and certificates of serving for two years after graduation;

	3. Graduates of public or private senior vocational schools or secondary technical schools with graduation certificates and certificates of serving for two years after graduation;

	4. Those who have equivalent academic ability to senior high school graduates and have one of the following certificates:

		(1) Certificate from the education administrative department of the people's government above the county level or the municipal people's government;

		(2) Certificate from the trade union above the county level or the political organ above the regiment level of the People's Liberation Army.

III. Regarding examination subjects:

	1. The common compulsory subjects for all departments are as follows:

		Chinese language, foreign language (English or Russian), general knowledge of politics, mathematics, Chinese and foreign history, Chinese and foreign geography, physics, chemistry (history and geography, physics and chemistry subjects can be examined separately or jointly according to the nature of the departments).

	2. In order to take into account the actual situation of foreign language teaching in some middle schools, although foreign language is listed as a common compulsory subject, applicants may be allowed to apply for exemption from the foreign language exam during registration. However, after being admitted to the school, they must take a supplementary foreign language (English, Russian) placement test, and be given remedial opportunities according to the test results.

	3. In addition to the common compulsory subjects for all departments, each school may add major subjects for each department based on the nature of the department (such as the Foreign Language Department of the School of Liberal Arts may add a foreign language test; the Medical School and the Agricultural School may add a biology test, and so on by analogy).

	4. Each school may set different ranges and levels of test questions according to the admission requirements of each department's curriculum. The main purpose is to test whether applicants have the preparatory conditions for studying in the relevant departments, and should never set strange or difficult questions that exceed the scope of the middle school curriculum.

IV. Regarding examination dates: In order to gradually correct the chaotic state caused by schools enrolling students on their own and reduce the waste of manpower, material resources, and time, the range of summer enrollment dates for national higher education institutions is specifically stipulated as follows: Registration dates: determined by the education department or cultural and education department of each major administrative region (hereinafter collectively referred to as the Ministry of Education); the five provinces and two cities in North China are determined by the Central Ministry of Education.

Examination dates: July 21st to August 10th; the announcement date shall not be later than August 25th.

The Ministry of Education of each major administrative region can control this range on its own and regularly implement joint or unified enrollment of all or part of the higher education institutions at appropriate locations according to the specific conditions of the region. If unified enrollment is difficult, the Ministry of Education of each major administrative region may consider the situation and allow each school to enroll students on its own within the basic spirit of these regulations. However, the school must still report the enrollment process and the test questions to the Central Ministry of Education through the Ministry of Education of the major administrative region where it is located for record. The five provinces and two cities in North China shall be handled by the Central Ministry of Education.

V. Those who meet one of the following conditions may be admitted leniently even if their examination results are slightly lower:

	1. Industrial workers with more than three years of work experience;

	2. Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary soldiers who have worked for more than three years;

	3. Students of ethnic minorities;

	4. Overseas Chinese students.

Students who meet the above conditions must submit certificates from relevant agencies, troops, factories, and organizations when applying for the exam.

VI. All schools should pay attention to the basic spirit of these regulations when recruiting transfer students or graduate students. In particular, the recruitment of graduate students should pay close attention to the close connection with national construction, and strictly select young people with progressive thinking, excellent academic performance, research ability, and promising prospects.

The recruitment of graduate students shall be reviewed by the Ministry of Education of each major administrative region and submitted to the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government for approval before it can be held (the five provinces and two cities in North China shall be reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government).

VII. The Ministry of Education of each major administrative region shall be responsible for organizing and leading the enrollment committee in each region to carry out enrollment work. After the enrollment work is completed, it shall promptly summarize the experience and report the test questions to the Central Ministry of Education for record.

VIII. Regarding specific issues such as the enrollment quota of each school, registration fees, examination areas, and scholarships, in addition to the higher education institutions in the five provinces and two cities in North China being separately stipulated by the Central Ministry of Education, each higher education institution may be determined by the Ministry of Education of each major administrative region according to the actual situation.

If an individual school cannot enroll students within the date range stipulated in Article 4 due to special circumstances, it must submit an application to the Ministry of Education of the major administrative region where it is located for approval. Those belonging to the five provinces and two cities in North China shall submit an application to the Central Ministry of Education for approval.

IX. The enrollment of the Renmin University of China and the local People's Revolutionary Universities, and Military and Political Universities shall be stipulated separately.
