　　Beijing Municipal Supply Bureau Warehouse Keepers Commended for Protecting Warehouse
　　During the heavy rain last month, Liu Zao Hui, Du En, Jia Yu Zhen, Zhang Dian Kui, and other warehouse keepers of the No. 3 Warehouse of the Beijing Supply Bureau carefully inspected the warehouses and never left. When Yan Xi Chen, Zhou Zheng Zhai, Zhang Wei Rong, and other comrades were covering the open-air stacks with tarpaulins, they took off their cotton-padded clothes and worked in their shirts in the heavy rain. Other comrades also helped to move sacks in the rain and persisted until the work was completed. In addition, in the No. 5 Warehouse, many staff members' cotton-padded clothes were soaked while working day and night to protect leaking warehouses, cover open-air stacks, dig ditches, and dredge waterways. They were commended by the Supply Bureau.

　　京市供应局仓库保管人员
    抢护仓库受表扬
    上月大雨时，北京供应局第三仓库的库房保管员刘早惠、杜恩、贾玉珍、张殿奎等同志认真检查库房，一直未曾离开。阎锡臣、周正斋、张维荣等同志在上露天垛盖雨布时脱掉棉衣，穿着单褂在大雨下进行工作。其他同志也在雨下帮同搬运麻袋，一直坚持到工作完成。此外第五仓库在抢护漏雨的库房、盖露天垛、挖掘水沟、疏通水道等工作中，许多工作人员身上棉衣湿透了，还是昼夜坚持工作。他们受到了供应局的表扬。
