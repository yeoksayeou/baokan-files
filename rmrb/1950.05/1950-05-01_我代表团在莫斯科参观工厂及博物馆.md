Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th: TASS Moscow, 29th dispatch: The delegation of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, currently visiting Moscow, is touring the Soviet capital. The Chinese labor leaders have toured the city and visited the Lenin Central Museum twice. They paid close attention to the documents and materials related to the life of the great leader.

On April 28th, members of the delegation visited the Central Committee of the Textile Workers' Union. They were very interested in the work of the union and its care for the working people. At the request of the guests, Rona Muravyova, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Textile Workers' Union, described in detail the social insurance system in the Soviet textile industry. She said that the government had greatly increased the funds allocated to the union for this purpose this year, amounting to approximately 750 million rubles. This money will be used for sickness benefits, to pay for textile workers' vacations and medical treatment at various sanatoriums, and as funding for children's summer camps. Because female workers account for 70 percent of the textile industry, a large amount of social insurance funds are used for allowances during maternity leave. The total amount of this allowance this year is 68 million rubles. Textile workers have 890 nurseries and kindergartens, where children are cared for when their mothers are busy at work.

Hang Huilan, a female worker from the Shanghai No. 1 Cotton Mill, told the Soviet textile workers about the improvement in the situation of workers since the establishment of the Chinese People's Government.

　　我代表团在莫斯科参观工厂及博物馆
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十九日电：现在正访问莫斯科的中华全国总工会代表团，正在苏联首都各处观光。中国工会的领袖们游览了全城，并两次往观列宁中央博物馆。他们在那里对于有关伟大领袖的生平事迹的文件与资料，给予密切的注意。
    四月二十八日，代表团团员往访纺织工人工会中央委员会。他们对该工会的工作及其对劳动人民的照顾很感兴趣。纺织工人工会中央委员会主席洛娜·穆拉维雅娃应客人之请，详细描述苏联纺织工业中的社会保险制度。她说：今年政府为此目的而拨给工会的款额大大增加，约达七亿五千万卢布。这笔钱将用之于疾病补助金、支付纺织工人在各休养地休养与医疗的费用，并作儿童夏令营的经费。由于纺织工业中女工占百分之七十，所以有大量的社会保险基金充作分娩假期中的津贴。今年此项津贴总额共达六千八百万卢布。纺织工人有八百九十个托儿所和保育学校，当母亲们忙于工作的时候，孩子们便送到其中由人照管。
