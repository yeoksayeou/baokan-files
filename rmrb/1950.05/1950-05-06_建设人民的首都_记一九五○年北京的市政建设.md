　　Building a People's Capital
　　--On the Municipal Construction of Beijing in 1950
　　Yang Chongye　Liu Xiangbo
　　Beijing is one of the most famous ancient capitals in the world. Since it was established as a capital in the Liao Dynasty, it has gone through five dynasties and has a history of more than a thousand years. Look at the quaint palaces, the magnificent and resplendent arches, the Temple of Heaven with its blue dome and white jade railings, and the exquisitely carved marble Yunbiao, everything looks so solemn and beautiful. Beijing symbolizes Eastern culture and the outstanding wisdom of the Chinese working people.
　　But these great buildings were only for the enjoyment of a small number of parasitic exploiting ruling classes—emperors and concubines. People all know that Empress Dowager Cixi—the licentious "Queen" of the late Qing Dynasty—diverted naval funds to build the Summer Palace in the western suburbs of Beijing, where she would take a dragon boat there every year to escape the summer heat. I don’t know how much of the people's blood and sweat was spent and how many lives were sacrificed for their extravagant enjoyment.
　　After the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, under the reactionary rule of the Northern Warlords and the Kuomintang, their so-called construction could not escape the essence of serving the reactionary ruling class. For example, Yuan'en Temple, where the reactionary leader Chiang Kai-shek lived, and Dongchang Hutong, where the court scholar Hu Shi lived, were not transportation arteries at all, but the roads were neatly built for the convenience of these reactionary figures. The most ridiculous thing was Wuyiku Street in the Western District. Before the July 7th Incident, Song Zheyuan, who was once a "figure of the hour" in North China, lived there, so the dirt road was changed to an asphalt road. However, his car only went west and not east, so the asphalt road was only built on the western half. In Beijing, the reactionary government agencies and the residences of "rich and powerful families" were mostly concentrated in the eastern and western cities. Therefore, more modern facilities, such as hospitals, schools, sewers, water pipes, and telephones, were also concentrated in the eastern and western cities. As for the places where the working people lived, there were very few of these facilities. The worst environment was Longxu Ditch. The residents in this area were scattered workers, rickshaw pullers, and poor citizens. There was not a decent street or a decent house here. The residents drank well water that was four or five times more expensive and dirtier than tap water. The total population of the outer city was 500,000, and the sewage of 400,000 people flowed into a winding and narrow Longxu Ditch. The water in the ditch was covered with a green color of ancient bronze rust, and the stench was overwhelming for nine months of the year. Flies and mosquitoes bred everywhere, and it was a source of infectious diseases throughout the years. This is the result of the past municipal construction policy that served the reactionary class.
　　The municipal construction of the People's Government is essentially different from that of the past reactionary regime. The municipal construction policy adopted at the Second Session of the Second Municipal People's Representative Conference of Beijing on February 26 this year clearly pointed out that it should serve production and the working people. Since most of the financial expenditure is to be used for restoring and developing production, this year's municipal construction can only selectively carry out necessary projects with emphasis.
　　Dredging the Three Seas and reorganizing Beijing's river and lake system is a major project in this year's municipal construction. The Three Seas—Beihai, Zhonghai, and Nanhai—have a total water surface of 864,000 square meters. These are artificial lakes dug in the imperial city by feudal emperors for recreation and to embellish the scenery. The Three Seas and the Jin River, Chang River, which lead to the water source of Yuquan Mountain, as well as the moat around the inner and outer cities and the Tongzi River surrounding the Forbidden City, constitute a complete river and lake system in Beijing. If they are well utilized, they will be very important for regulating temperature and improving environmental sanitation. However, due to years of disrepair, the waterways have been silted up, and the Three Seas have become large stagnant pools, and the sewage in the city is not easily discharged. In order to protect the health of citizens, the People's Government has decided to thoroughly dredge the rivers and lakes of Beijing this year. The dredging of the Three Seas project started on March 11, and it is estimated that 271,700 square meters of mud will be excavated, mobilizing 10,000 to 15,000 people every day. Now 40% of the dredging project has been completed, and it will be completed by the end of May.
　　Several river projects have been completed and put into water. If we compare the completed Northwest Moat with the Northeast Moat that has not yet been constructed, they are really two different worlds. One side has a raised riverbed, overgrown with weeds, scattered garbage, and stagnant water shining; the other side has green spring water, reflecting the reflection of the ancient city, goslings welcoming the sun and brightening their white wings, and women are washing clothes together under the shade of the willows, like a picture. The Qian San Men Moat, which runs through the downtown area of the outer city, has become living water. The newly planted small trees on the bank have sprouted tender branches, and the embankment has been repaired neatly. In the future, the upstream sluice gates can be flushed at any time after they are repaired, so there will be no more sewage accumulation.
　　Soviet experts have given us great help in this regard. They particularly pointed out that smooth-flowing water is very important for improving the urban sanitary environment. In order to solve the water source problem, Soviet experts suggested drilling electromechanical wells. Five wells have now been drilled. The test results show that each well can produce 4,000 tons of water per day, and the cost is very low. One kilowatt-hour of electricity can pump 20 to 30 tons of water. It is planned to complete 15 wells this year, which will exceed the water supply of Yuquan Mountain, so that there will be sufficient water supply in the city even during the dry season in summer.
　　Another construction project is the renovation of the sewer system. A large part of Beijing's sewers are still dark ditches built in the Ming Dynasty, which are now five or six hundred years old. The material used is fine mud bricks weighing 48 kilograms each, covered with bluestone. Although they are very clumsy, they are very strong. Generally, they can support for decades, but they lack inspection wells and rain inlets. A long section in the middle has not been dredged for more than a hundred years. It is estimated that the total amount of silt is about 160,000 tons. This year, due to financial constraints, only six of the thirteen sewer systems will be excavated, and the local ditch bodies will be renovated. In addition to renovating the old ditches, some new ditches will be built this year. The People's Government has decided to convert 3,000 meters of the upper reaches of Longxu Ditch into dark ditches (pipe ditches), which will begin construction soon. The work of repairing the ditches started earlier in order to solve the fertilizer problem for some farmers before the spring plowing. According to the test results, the ammonium content of the ditch mud is 0.29 to 0.6, which can抵 [be equivalent to] 30% to 40% of manure fertilizer. Most of the farmers who have just been liberated are unable to buy fertilizer. They are very happy to use carts to transport the ditch mud back and mix it with some horse manure to create cheap fertilizer. The work of repairing the ditches is all carried out in exchange for work. Many unemployed workers and poor citizens spontaneously organized to participate in this work. They are very enthusiastic and the project is progressing very quickly.
　　In terms of road projects, it is planned to build a total of 26 kilometers of new asphalt roads, ballast roads, and cobblestone roads this year, with an area of 216,272 square meters. The principle of building new roads is to connect industrial centers, facilitate public transportation, and meet the needs of the majority of people. The planned roads include the Jingmen Highway (leading to the Shijingshan Industrial Zone and the Mentougou Mining Area), the Jianguomen to the Eastern Suburb Industrial Zone, and ten main lines in the city. Chongwai Avenue is one of the important main lines of the outer city. During the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, merchants and residents requested repairs many times but were not successful. Now construction has begun. In addition, it is planned to install 3,000 street lights and plant 70,000 trees this year, and build 13,200 meters of new tap water pipes in the outer city and northern city where the working people live, and set up 92 public water stations.
　　In terms of public health, a health and medical network will be gradually established. Public and private hospitals will be entrusted or designated to provide free or reduced-fee treatment to poor working people, with subsidies from the government. Workers' clinics will be added in concentrated worker areas, mobile medical teams will be established in suburban areas, and city-wide maternal and child health organizations and midwives will be organized to provide free check-ups and deliveries for poor pregnant women throughout the city, thus solving the fertility problems of 12,000 poor households.
　　Citizens throughout the city, especially the working people, have expressed infinite welcome and gratitude for the municipal construction of the People's Government. Citizens in the Dashiqiao area said: "The Kuomintang reactionaries have not repaired the sewers here for decades. When it rains, the ditch mud overflows. It is dirty and smelly. Now it is good." When the public water station in Longxu Ditch has not been finally installed, some people are already waiting to fetch water with buckets. When the residents there heard that the government was going to rebuild Longxu Ditch into a dark ditch, they were so happy that they said: "We will never smell the stench again. The People's Government is thinking about the working people everywhere!"
　　This year's municipal construction in Beijing is just the starting point for the construction of our great people's capital. I believe that under the leadership of the People's Government, the people's capital of Beijing has unlimited prospects for development.

　　建设人民的首都
    ——记一九五○年北京的市政建设
    杨重野　刘向勃
    北京是世界上有名的古都之一，从辽时建都迄今，已经历过五个朝代了，一千多年的历史。看那古色古香的宫殿，那金碧辉煌的牌坊，那蓝色穹形殿宇衬托着白玉栏杆的天坛和那琢雕精美的大理石的云表，一切都显得那么庄严和美丽。北京象征着东方的文化和中国劳动人民杰出的智慧。
    但这些伟大的建筑过去只是供少数寄生剥削的统治阶级——帝王妃嫔的享用。人们都知道慈禧——这个满清末代的荒淫的“女王”，曾挪用海军费修建北京西郊的颐和园，她每年乘着大龙凤舟要到那里去消夏。为了他们的奢侈享受不知花了多少人民的血汗钱，牺牲了多少人民的生命。
    满清推翻以后，在北洋军阀和国民党反动统治下，他们的所谓建设同样脱不出为反动统治阶级服务的本质。比如反动头子蒋介石住过的圆恩寺和御用学者胡适住过的东厂胡同根本不是什么交通要道，但为着这些反动人物的往来方便起见，马路却修得整整齐齐。最滑稽的要算是西城武衣库街，七七事变前曾一时成为华北“风云人物”的宋哲元在那里住过，土路因此改成了柏油路，但他的汽车只往西走而不往东走，那条柏油路也就只修了西边的半截儿。在北京的反动政府机关和“富贵人家”的住宅多集中在东西城，因此比较近代的设备，如医院、学校、下水道、自来水管、电话等也多集中在东西城；至于劳动人民聚居的地方，就很少有这些设备了。环境最坏的要算龙须沟，这一带居民，都是些零散工人、三轮车夫、贫苦市民。这里没有一条像样子的街道，也没有一所像样的房子，居民喝的是比自来水贵四五倍而又肮脏的井水。全部外城的人口是五十万，其中四十万人口的污水都流到一条曲折狭小的龙须沟里。沟里水泛着古铜锈的绿色，一年有九个月臭气熏天，苍蝇、蚊子到处滋生着，历年是传染病的发源地。这就是过去一套为反动阶级服务的市政建设方针的结果。
    人民政府的市政建设与过去反动政权有着本质上的不同。在今年二月二十六日北京市第二届第二次各界人民代表会上通过的市政建设方针明确地指出：要为生产服务，为劳动人民服务。由于财政开支大部要从事恢复与发展生产，今年的市政建设只能有重点地选择必要的工程来进行。
    疏浚三海和整理北京的河湖系统是今年市政建设中一项较大的工程。三海——北海、中海、南海共有八十六万四千平方公尺的水面，这是封建皇帝为了游乐和点缀风景在皇城内挖成的人工湖。三海和通往玉泉山水源的金河、长河及围绕内外城的护城河和环绕紫金城的筒子河，构成了北京城完整的河湖系统，如果把它们好好加以利用，对调剂气温和改善环境卫生都很重要的。但由于年久失修，水路淤塞，三海成了大死水坑，城内的污水也不易排泄出去。为了保障市民健康，人民政府今年下决心要把北京河湖彻底疏浚一下。疏浚三海工程已在三月十一日开始，预计挖泥二十七万一千七百平方公尺，每天动员人工一万人至一万五千人。现在疏浚工程已完成百分之四十，五月下旬即可全部竣工。
    河道工程有好几处已经完工放水了。如果把已经完工的西北护城河和尚未施工的东北护城河对比一下真是两个世界。一面是河底突起，水草丛生，垃圾散堆着，死水在发光；另一面是春水绿波，映照古城的倒影，乳鹅迎着阳光亮起白色的翅膀，柳荫下妇女们结伴在洗衣服，像是一幅画面。横贯外城闹市区的前三门护城河已经变成活水了，岸上新栽的小树已抽出了嫩枝，堤岸也已修理得平平整整，将来上游闸坝修好后还可以随时冲刷，从此再不会有污水积存下来。
    苏联专家在这方面给我们很大的帮助，他们特别指出畅通的流水对改善城市卫生环境十分重要。为了解决水源问题，苏联专家建议打机电井，现已凿好五眼，试验结果，每井每天可出四千吨水，费用很低，一度电可抽水二十吨至三十吨。今年计划完成十五眼，这样就可超出玉泉山的供水量，使在夏季枯水期间，城内也有充足的水量供给。
    另一项建设工程是整修下水道。北京的下水道有很大一部分还是明朝修的暗沟，距今已有五六百年了。使用材料是重四十八斤一块的细泥城砖，上盖青石，虽然很笨拙却很坚固，一般的还可以支持几十年，但缺少探井及雨水口等，中间有很长一大段百多年来就没疏通过，估计总淤泥量在十六万吨左右。今年因限于财力只就十三个下水道系统中掏挖六个，并将局部的沟身翻修。除整修旧沟外，今年并建筑一部分新沟，人民政府已决定把龙须沟上游三千公尺改为暗沟（管沟），不久即将动工。修沟的工作开始较早，为的是在春耕前解决一部分农民的肥料问题。据化验结果，沟泥所含的铵为零点二九至零点六，可抵粪肥三成至四成。刚翻身的农民大半无力购买肥料，他们很高兴地用大车把沟泥运回去掺合一些马粪，造成廉价的肥料。修沟的工作全部是以工代赈，很多失业工人和贫苦市民自动组织起来参加这项工作，他们热情很高，工程进度也很快。
    道路工程方面今年拟新修沥青路、石碴路、卵石路总长二十六公里，面积二一六、二七二平方公尺。新修道路以联系产业中心、便利公共交通和适应多数人民需要为原则。计划修筑的有京门公路（通往石景山工业区和门头沟矿区），建国门到东郊工业区及市内干线等十条。崇外大街是外城的重要干线之一，在国民党反动统治时期商民请求了多少次也没修，现在已经动工了。此外，今年并计划补装路灯三千盏，植树七万株，并在劳动人民聚居的外城和北城新建自来水管一万三千二百公尺，设立共用水站九十二处。
    公共卫生方面，将逐步建立卫生医疗网，委托或指定公私立医院为贫苦的劳动人民免费或减费施诊，由公家给予补贴，在工人集中区增设工人医疗所，在郊区建立医疗巡回队，并组织全市妇婴卫生机关及助产士为全市贫苦产妇免费检查、接生，这样就解决了一万二千户贫苦产妇的生育问题。
    全市市民，尤其是劳动人民，对人民政府的市政建设都表示无限的欢迎和感激。大石桥区市民说：“几十年来国民党反动派就没有修理过这里的下水道，一下雨沟泥就漫出来了，又脏又臭，现在可好了。”龙须沟的共用水站还没有最后安装好时，已经有人提着水桶等着取水了，当那里的居民听到政府要把龙须沟改建为暗沟时，高兴的不得了，他们说：“以后再不闻臭味了，人民政府处处为着劳动人民着想啊！”
    今年北京的市政建设只是我们伟大的人民首都建设的起点。相信在人民政府领导下人民首都北京有着无限发展的前途。
