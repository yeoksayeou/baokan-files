　　The Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government
    Concentrates Efforts on Clearing Backlogged Cases
    First Phase Focuses on Resolving Housing Disputes
    [This newspaper's dispatch] The Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government began a concentrated effort to clear backlogged cases on the 22nd. Prior to this, the court had held several meetings of senior cadres to study and decide on methods for carrying out the work of clearing backlogged cases. A mobilization meeting of all cadres was held last weekend for this purpose. President Shen Junru pointed out at the meeting that failure to quickly clear backlogged cases would have a serious impact on society. He encouraged all comrades to increase their enthusiasm for serving the people, strengthen their sense of responsibility, learn new experiences from their work, create new working methods, and complete this arduous task. He particularly pointed out that while the work of clearing old cases should be completed as quickly as possible, it must not be done crudely and should be responsible to the people.
    The court's current clearance of backlogged cases is being carried out in stages with a focus on key areas. The first stage focuses on housing dispute cases. In terms of personnel organization, the court has adopted a three-tier organization of division chief level, group leader level, and judge level, with each level being responsible and centrally led. In terms of working methods and techniques (such as the format of relevant judgments and the methods for evaluating cases in each group), many new improvements have also been decided. Department-level cadres work in a centralized office, and any difficult problems are resolved through immediate consultation. Group leaders and judges write articles on the bulletin board, reporting on the progress of the blitz work and work experience, to ensure the completion of the blitz task. Currently, the court has launched a high tide of the blitz.
    After the establishment of the Supreme People's Court, it received 1,361 cases transferred from the former North China People's Court (including 883 civil cases and 478 criminal cases), and the number of appeal cases sent by local courts has been increasing day by day. In particular, since there are no second-instance appeal bodies in Beijing and Tianjin, all appeal cases are directly sent to the court for processing. In addition, the court has very few adjudicators, resulting in an increasing backlog of cases. As of the 20th of this month, there were 3,043 pending cases (including 2,593 civil cases and 450 criminal cases, with housing dispute cases accounting for about 70% of civil cases). At the end of February this year, the court transferred more than 60 students from the former University of Political Science and Law to participate in the blitz work of clearing backlogged cases. However, after less than a month of work, the students of the University of Political Science and Law were transferred back to the school for summarizing their studies. This work was not carried out due to limited manpower. In early April, the court successively transferred about 90 cadres from various parties. After more than a month of training in their work, they have gradually become familiar with the business, which has prepared conditions for the court to launch another blitz to clear backlogged cases.

### 中央人民政府最高人民法院  集中力量清理积案  第一阶段以解决房屋纠纷为重点

　　中央人民政府最高人民法院
    集中力量清理积案     
    第一阶段以解决房屋纠纷为重点
    【本报讯】中央人民政府最高人民法院已于二十二日起开始突击清理积案工作。事前该院曾多次召开高级干部会议，研究并决定了进行清理积案工作的办法。上周末并为此举行了全体干部动员大会。沈钧儒院长在会中指出积案不迅速清理，对社会有严重影响；鼓励全体同志提高为人民服务的热情，加强责任心，从工作中吸取新的经验，创造新的工作方法，完成此一艰巨任务；并特别指出对旧案清理工作一方面要尽速完成，另一方面决不能粗糙从事，应对人民负责。
    该院此次清理积案，系分阶段作重点突击。第一阶段以房屋纠纷案件为重点。在人事组织方面，该院采取了庭长级、组长级、审判员级的三级组织，分层负责，集中领导。在工作方法和技术上（如有关判决书形式及各组评议案件的方法等），也决定了许多新的改进办法。处长级干部集中办公，遇有困难问题立即协议解决。组长及审判员等在墙报上写稿，报导突击工作的进行情形与工作经验，保证完成突击任务。目前，该院已掀起突击高潮。
    最高人民法院成立后，接收了前华北人民法院移交的案件一千三百六十一件（其中民事八百八十三件，刑事四百七十八件），而各地法院陆续送来上诉案件又日益增加，尤其京津两市因无第二审上诉机关，一切上诉案件均直接送该院处理，加以该院审判人员甚少，致积案日增。截至本月二十日止，未结案件达三千零四十三件（其中民事二千五百九十三件，刑事四百五十件，民事案件中房屋纠纷案约占百分之七十）。今年二月末，该院曾调集前政法大学学员六十余人参加清理积案突击工作；进行工作未满一月，政法大学学生因总结学习被调回学校。此项工作因人力所限，未贯彻下去。四月初，该院从各方陆续调来干部约九十名，经过月余来在工作中的锻炼，已逐渐熟习了业务，为该院此次再度发动突击清理积案工作准备了条件。
