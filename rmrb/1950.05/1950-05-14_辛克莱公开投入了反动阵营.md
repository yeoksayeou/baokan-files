　　Upton Sinclair Openly Joins the Reactionary Camp
　　By Pavlenko, Translated by Cai Shiji
　　…Upton Sinclair has now adopted an openly hostile attitude toward the Soviet Union. It is true that we have read some of his works, and we have translations of some of the better works of this literary peddler. However, not all of us know that the merchandise in Sinclair's store is always diverse and can meet various needs.
　　Upton Sinclair began his literary career by supplying sensational anecdotes and humorous short poems to low-brow newspapers, and then wrote cheap, five-cent novels exclusively for "Street & Smith" publishing house. Thus, the total volume of his works quickly reached that of the complete works of Walter Scott. Later, he published some psychological novels—which were exactly what the market needed at the time. These psychological novels were followed by the first work on a social theme—"The Jungle." But this was already in 1906, when the repercussions of the first Russian revolution spread throughout the world, arousing great interest in political literature. It was the same year that Maxim Gorky's greatest work depicting a proletarian family—"Mother"—appeared.
　　After "The Jungle," Upton Sinclair played literary tricks with sexual issues for eleven years, until, under the impact of the October Revolution in 1917, he published "King Coal" and, the following year, "Jimmie Higgins." As soon as we read this book, we know it is a crude work; Higgins is a martyr to social ideals, not a victor. Let us not forget that Upton Sinclair once said: "In my childhood and adolescence, people always made me believe: 'Money is writing'… Therefore, this formula meant to me: 'Silence.'" But he did not remain silent for long. From the age of fifteen, money began to write with his hand. He himself does not hide this. "Anyone who can succeed in the art world lives like a turtle, wearing protective armor," he said in 1927, five years before this "sociologist" wrote the essay "Mental Radio," praising his wife's achievements in spiritualism. When he wrote this essay, fashionable things about various ghosts were exactly popular in the United States, and those books about mental calling were bestsellers.
　　After becoming a spiritualism peddler, Upton Sinclair withdrew from the Socialist Party and begged for the position of Governor of California with the affected airs of a newly trained agitator. He wrote a campaign booklet called "I, Governor of California, and How I Ended Poverty," in which this veteran literary peddler was completely exposed to the people of the country. Everyone regarded him as a despicable and boring braggart. Therefore, even with many important American figures personally present, he was not elected.
　　In 1943, when we were engaged in a white-hot struggle against German fascists, this cosmopolitan—Mr. Upton Sinclair—shamelessly declared: "When Germany is defeated in the future, the United Nations should not try to reorganize Europe with the pre-war boundaries. Instead, it should establish 'free countries' on the basis of the economic centralization of Europe already organized by the Nazis." For him, acting as Churchill's echo was more competent than working as a writer against fascism.
　　At present, when the American people are looking for ways to defend peace, and the Truman government is frantically preparing for war, a seasoned opportunist is bound to choose a path between war and peace. Upton Sinclair chose war. In his later years, he finally stopped playing hide-and-seek and openly joined the reactionary camp. Obviously, this is a determined decision. His life is an excellent warning for American liberals. Sinclair Lewis also took this path. Obviously, Steinbeck is also taking this path. In America, money is writing. Since it is money, there is no conscience. Of course, there is also another literary America, which is proud of the names of some real progressive writers: such as Howard Fast, Albert E. Kahn, Richard O. Boyer, Alexander Saxton, Norman Mailer, Lillian Hellman, Clifford Odets, and many other writers who are very famous at home and abroad. Everyone is listening to their voices. Therefore, their path is even more difficult. Greed for money and power may ruin more than just one well-begun life. It is difficult to be an honest writer in America.

　　辛克莱公开投入了反动阵营
    巴甫连科作　蔡时济译
    ……厄普顿·辛克莱现在对苏联已经采取了公开的敌对态度。我们的确读过他的一些作品，并且我们有这个文学贩子的某些较好的作品的译本，这也是真的。可是，并不是我们所有的人都知道辛克莱的作品商店里的货色永远是各色齐备能够应付各种需要的。
    厄普顿·辛克莱是以向低级趣味的报纸供给一些奇闻轶事和滑稽短诗而开始了文学生涯，随后就专为“斯崔特史密斯”出版社写些五分钱一本的廉价小说，于是他的作品的总量，很快地就达到了瓦尔特·史各德的全集那么多。后来又出版了些心理小说——它们正是当时市场上所需要的。这些心理小说之后——出版了第一部社会主题的作品——《屠场》。但这已经是一九○六年的事，那时候俄国第一次革命的反响遍于全世界，引起了对政治文学的巨大兴趣。这正是马克西姆·高尔基的最伟大的描写无产阶级家庭的作品——《母亲》出现的那一年。
    《屠场》以后，厄普顿·辛克莱在性欲问题里耍了十一年的文学把戏，直到一九一七年在十月革命的震响之下，出版了《石炭王》及其后一年的《吉米·希金斯》。我们只要一读这本书，就知道它是一个粗劣的作品，希金斯是一个社会理想的殉道者，而不是一个胜利者。我们不要忘了厄普顿·辛克莱曾经说过这样的话：“在我幼年和少年的时候，人们就老是使我相信：‘金钱在写作’……因此，这个公式对我的意思是：‘沉默’。”可是他并没有沉默很久。从他十五岁起，金钱就用他的手开始写作了。对于这一点，连他自己也不掩饰。“凡是能在艺术界得到成功的人，都是会穿起护身的甲胄像乌龟一般生活着的”，这话是他在一九二七年说的，那是在这位“社会学家”写好那篇歌颂他太太的降神术的成就的论文“心灵电报”五年之前。在他写这篇论文的时候，关于各种鬼怪的时髦东西恰好盛行于美国，而那些关于心灵召唤的书籍都是畅销的。
    厄普顿·辛克莱，在他成为一个降神术的叫卖者之后就退出了社会党，并且用他那种才下水的挑拨者的娇态乞求加里福尼亚州长的职位。他写了一本竞选的小册子叫做《我如何消灭贫困》，在这本小册子里，这位老资格文学贩子是完全赤裸裸地暴露在全国人民的面前了。大家都把他看作一个卑鄙无聊的夸夸其谈者。因此，甚至在许多美国要人亲自临场的情形之下，他还是没有当选。
    一九四三年，正当我们和德国法西斯作白热化的斗争的时候，这位世界主义者——厄普顿·辛克莱先生竟厚颜地宣称：“将来德国战败的时候，联合国不应该试图以战前的疆界来重新组织欧洲。它倒是应该在已经被纳粹党人组织好的欧洲的经济集中化的基础上建立‘自由国家’。”对于他，担任邱吉尔应声虫的角色，比担任作为一个反法西斯战士的作家的工作，要胜任愉快。
    目前，当美国人民正在寻找保卫和平的道路、而杜鲁门政府疯狂地准备战争的时候，一个老练的钻营家势必要在战争与和平中间选择一条道路。厄普顿·辛克莱选择了战争。到了晚年，他终于停止了捉迷藏的把戏，公开投入了反动阵营。显然的，这是死心塌地的了。他的一生，是美国的自由主义者的极好的殷鉴。辛克莱·路易士走的也是这条路。很明显的，斯坦倍克也正在走这条路。在美国，是金钱在写作。既然是金钱，就没有良心。当然，也还有着另外一个文学的美国，这个美国是以一些真正的进步作家的名字而骄傲的：例如哈华特·法斯特（Howard Fast），亚尔伯特·凯恩（Albert E. Kahn）·里卡特·波依尔（Richard O. Boyer），亚力山大·萨克斯顿（Alexander Saxtu），诺尔曼·迈勒（Norman Mailer），里连·赫尔曼（Lillian Hellman），克里佛特·奥德茨（Clifford Odets），以及其他许多在国内外都非常驰名的作家。大家都正在倾听着他们的声音。因此，他们的道路，也就更艰难了。金钱和权力的贪欲可能糟塌的不只是某一个完善地开始的生活。在美国做一个正直的作家是困难的。（本文是巴甫连科著《美国印象记》中的一段，题目是我加的—译者）
