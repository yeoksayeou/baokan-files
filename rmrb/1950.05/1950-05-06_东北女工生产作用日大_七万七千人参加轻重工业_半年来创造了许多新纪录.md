Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th -- With the restoration and development of industrial construction, the role of female workers in enterprises in Northeast China is becoming increasingly significant. Currently, there are approximately 77,900 female workers participating in industrial production throughout Northeast China, including over 21,000 in the Lushun-Dalian area, over 10,600 in Shenyang, over 4,300 in Harbin, and over 4,600 in Changchun. In addition to widespread participation in light industrial production, large numbers of women are entering heavy industrial sectors in various regions. For example, as of January of this year, the Lushun-Dalian area had over 2,400 female workers participating in heavy industrial production, including train drivers, light oil truck drivers, lathe operators, shipbuilding workers, foundry workers, electrical workers, and casting workers. In Shenyang, many heavy industrial departments have also begun to recruit female workers. For example, the state-owned Machine Factory No. 3 has more than 30 female apprentices learning milling and lathe work. The Changchun Tram Factory currently has 25 female drivers operating trams. The Shenyang Tram Factory also opened a female driver training class at the beginning of last month.

Female workers, like their male counterparts, enthusiastically participated in the "Creating New Production Records" campaign launched in October last year. According to statistics from 24 factories in Shenyang, female workers have created 333 new records. Among the 1,358 record-breakers in Andong, 288 were female workers. Out of 981 female workers in state-owned and public-owned factories in Jilin City, 120 created new records. These include improvements in operating methods, tool improvements, and increased labor intensity. In the light industrial sector, Xin Guilan, a female worker in the weaving group of the Northeast Woolen Mill, wove 29.10 meters of tweed in nine hours. In the Northeast No. 2 Textile Factory's worsted department, Sun Weiliang tended three worsted machines (1,320 spindles) alone, spinning 0.259 pounds of 32-count yarn in ten hours, breaking the factory's new record. Chang Yongfen, a female worker at the Andong Provincial Silk Weaving Factory, improved her operating method, shortening the time to join thread ends from 4.18 minutes to 1.49 minutes, setting a new record for twisting. In the heavy industrial sector, seven female workers in the expanding ring department of the Dalian Metal Machinery Factory completed the task of producing 50,000 expanding rings in 23 days, which was originally a three-month task; Chen Fenglan, a forming worker in the cemented carbide department of the steel factory, completed more than 110 kilograms of cemented carbide, exceeding the task by 25 percent.

Currently, over 58,000 female workers in Northeast China have joined trade unions, and over 600 have joined the Communist Party, with 1,790 joining the Communist Youth League. Many female workers have also been elected as members of trade union committees and employee representatives, or have been promoted to production management cadres and trade union cadres. In addition, the welfare of female workers is gradually improving. Men and women workers in various enterprises and factories have implemented equal pay for equal work, and men and women workers in public-owned factories enjoy the same labor insurance benefits. Regulations have also been made regarding maternity leave and subsidies before and after childbirth and miscarriage. Factories with a large number of female workers have also established daytime nurseries.

　　东北女工生产作用日大
    七万七千人参加轻重工业  半年来创造了许多新纪录
    【新华社沈阳四日电】随着工业建设的恢复与发展，东北各企业中女工的作用日益显著起来。目前东北全境参加工业生产的女工约七万七千九百余人，其中旅大地区有二万一千余人，沈阳市一万零六百余人，哈尔滨市四千三百余人，长春市四千六百余人。各地女工除广泛地参加轻工业生产外，还有大批妇女涌入重工业部门。如旅大地区截至今年一月份止，参加重工业生产的女工即达二千四百余人。其中包括火车司机、轻油车司机、车床、修船、翻砂、电气、铸造工等。沈阳市也有不少重工业部门开始吸收女工。如国营机器三厂已有三十余名女学徒学习铣床和旋盘工作。长春市电车厂现有二十五名女司机驾驶电车。沈阳市电车厂也于上月初开办了女司机训练班。
    女工们和男工同样热烈地参加了去年十月间发起的创造生产新纪录运动。据沈阳市二十四个工厂的统计，女工们创造的新纪录即有三百三十三件。安东市一千三百五十八名创造新纪录者中有二百八十八名是女工。吉林市国营、公营工厂的九百八十一名女工中，有一百二十名创造了新纪录。其中有改进操作方法的、有改良工具和提高劳动强度的。在轻工业部门中，如东北毛织厂织机组女工辛桂兰九小时织呢二十九米十。东北第二纺织厂精纺部孙维良一个人看三台精纺机（一千三百二十锭子），十小时纺三十二支纱零点二五九磅，突破全厂的新纪录。安东市省营丝织厂女工常永芬改进操作方法，接缕子由四点十八分缩短为一点四十九分，创造了捻头新纪录。在重工业部门中，如大连市金属机械厂涨圈部七个女工，在二十三天内完成了三个月生产五万涨圈的任务；钢铁厂硬质合金部成型工陈凤兰完成一百十多公斤硬质合金，超过任务百分之二十五。
    目前东北各地女工参加工会的已达五万八千余人，并有六百余人参加了共产党，一千七百九十余人参加了青年团。还有许多女工被选为工会委员和职工代表，或被提升为生产管理干部和工会干部。此外，女工的福利事业也在逐步改进中，各企业工厂中男女工已都实行了同工同酬，公营工厂中男女工同样享受劳动保险的待遇，而且规定了生育前后及小产的休假期和补助费。女工人数多的工厂并纷纷举办日间托儿所。
