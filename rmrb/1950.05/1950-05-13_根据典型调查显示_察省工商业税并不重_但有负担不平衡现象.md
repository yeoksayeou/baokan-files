　　According to Typical Survey Shows
　　Chahar Province's Industrial and Commercial Tax Is Not Heavy
　　But There Is an Imbalance in the Burden
    [This newspaper Zhangjiakou News] Reporter Li Yi reports: According to the preliminary survey results in mid-March on industrial and commercial taxes in Chahar Province last year and the first quarter of this year, the burden on general industrial and commercial households is lower than the tax payable according to the current Interim Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Taxes. The tax situation in Zhangjiakou City, which accounts for 40% of Chahar Province's tax revenue, is the most obvious. The Xingye Hardware Store in the city had a net profit of 13,585 bolts of "Five Blessings" cloth last year. According to the tax rate of 26% in the 12th grade, the income tax payable (Chahar Province only collected income tax last year) was 3,432 bolts of cloth (same as above, hereinafter omitted). However, the actual tax burden of the store last year was only 1,347 bolts of cloth. Heshengcheng, a fur business, had a net profit of 5,627 bolts of cloth last year. According to the tax rate of 30% in the 14th grade, the income tax payable was 1,688 bolts of cloth, but the actual tax burden was only 834 bolts of cloth. Yongfahe, the largest grocery wholesale store in Zhangjiakou City, had a net profit of 3,375 bolts of cloth last year. According to the tax rate of 30% in the 14th grade, the income tax payable was 1,012 bolts of cloth, but the actual burden was as low as 135 bolts of cloth. The survey material of 33 households in 12 major industries in Zhangjiakou City confirmed that the vast majority of industrial and commercial households had very light tax burdens in the past. The situation is similar in the industrial and commercial tax survey in Datong City. The number of industrial and commercial households in Datong City has increased from 400 when it was liberated in April last year to 1,096 by the end of the year. According to the survey of 14 households in the city's three major industries, only Fuzengxiang and Shengjihao in the flour industry exceeded their tax payable slightly because they overestimated their machine flour production capacity when assessing the tax amount. The other 12 households did not exceed it. Ruichenghao, a dried fruit store in the city, should pay 1,373 jin of millet for business and income tax in the first quarter of this year, while the actual tax burden was 1,026 jin. Liu Fuxiang Silk and Cloth Store had a total business volume of 290,712 jin of millet in the first quarter of this year. Calculated at a business tax rate of 2%, the business tax payable was 5,814 jin of millet. The net profit income in the same quarter was 22,687 jin of millet, and the tax rate in the 14th grade was 30%. The income tax payable for the entire quarter was 6,806 jin of millet. The total amount of business and income tax payable by the store was 12,620 jin of millet, while the actual tax burden was only 8,655 jin of millet. Secondly, the above situation also appeared in the industrial and commercial surveys in Xuanhua and Hunyuan in Chahar South, and Duolun in Chahar North. The annual net profit of Xingsheng Grocery Store in Xuanhua was 195 dan, 3 dou and 9 sheng of millet. Calculated at an income tax rate of 30%, the tax payable should be at least 58 dan, while the actual tax burden was only 31 dan and 6 dou. A fur and livestock store in Duolun City complained that the tax was too heavy. After investigation, it was found that its annual net profit was more than 30,000 jin of millet. Calculated at a tax rate of 14% in the 6th grade, the income tax payable by the store last year was 4,200 jin of millet, while the actual burden was only 1,948 jin. The typical survey of industrial and commercial taxes in Chahar Province shows that there are still vast tax sources that can be developed within the scope of Chahar Province. Therefore, it is necessary to patiently conduct investigation work first. Secondly, the preliminary survey materials show that the phenomenon of unbalanced burden exists, but only a small number of those who are overburdened, and the actual tax burden of the vast majority of industrial and commercial households is quite low compared to the tax payable by them.

　　根据典型调查显示
　　察省工商业税并不重
　　但有负担不平衡现象
    【本报张家口讯】记者李翼报导：察省去年及今年首季工商业税，据三月中旬初步调查结果，一般工商户负担均较按现行工商业税暂行条例规定之应负税额为低。以占察省税收百分之四十的张家口市税收情况来看，至为明显。该市兴业五金行去年一年纯利折五福布一万三千五百八十五匹，依税率在十二等为百分之廿六，应负所得税（察省去年仅征收所得税）额折布（同上，下略）三千四百三十二匹。而该行去年实际负担之税额仅为一千三百四十七匹。皮毛业合顺成去年一年所得纯利折布五千六百廿七匹，依税率在十四等为百分之三十，应负所得税额折布一千六百八十八匹，而实际负担之税额仅为八百三十四匹。张家口市最大的杂货批发店永发和号，去年纯利折布三千三百七十五匹，依税率在十四等为百分之三十，应负所得税额折布一千零十二匹，而实际负担竟少至一百三十五匹。张家口市十二个主要行业三十三户调查材料证实绝大多数工商户过去负税额均甚轻微。在大同市工商税调查中，情况亦然。大同市工商户已由去年四月刚解放时的四百户发展至年底的一千零九十六户。从该市三个主要行业十四户调查中看来，只有面粉业福增祥、盛记号因评议税额时过高的估计了其机器制粉的能力，实际负税额较其应负担之税额超出少许以外，其他十二户均未超过。该市干果行瑞成号今年首季应负营业、所得两项税额折小米为一千三百七十三斤，而实际负担之税额为一千零二十六斤。绸布行六蚨祥号，今年首季营业总额折小米二十九万零七百十二斤，以百分之二的营业税率计算，应纳营业税折小米五千八百十四斤，同季纯益所得折小米二万二千六百八十七斤，税率在十四等为百分之三十，全季应负所得税额折米六千八百零六斤。营业、所得两项税额合计，该号共应负担之税额为小米一万二千六百二十斤，而实际之负税额仅为小米八千六百五十五斤。其次在察南之宣化、浑源，察北之多伦等地工商业调查中亦同样出现上述情况。宣化兴胜杂货店去年一年纯利折合小米一百九十五担三斗九升，以百分之三十的所得税率计，其应负税额至少为五十八担，而实际负税额仅为三十一担六斗，多伦城一家皮毛牲畜店喊税过重，经调查后得出其去年纯利折米共三万余斤，依六等税率百分之十四计，该店去年应负所得税额折小米四千二百斤，而实际负担仅为一千九百四十八斤。察哈尔省工商业税典型调查显示，在察哈尔省范围内尚有广大税源可以开辟，为此就必须耐烦地首先进行调查工作，其次初步调查材料说明负担不平衡的现象是存在的，但负担过重者仅占少数，绝大多数工商户的实际负税额较诸其应负担之税额是相当低的。
