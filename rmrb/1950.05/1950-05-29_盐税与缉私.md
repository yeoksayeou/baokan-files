　　Salt Tax and Anti-Smuggling
　　Jiang Heng
　　One of Sichuan's Important Tax Sources
　　Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan and other provinces in Southwest China are salt-producing areas, among which Sichuan's rock salt is the most famous and has the richest production, with an annual output of up to 8 million dan. In addition to supplying the people of Sichuan with food, it can also export a part to other provinces. Therefore, salt tax revenue has always been a major source of tax revenue for Sichuan Province. Before liberation, countless miscellaneous taxes and levies, such as military expenses, military and political expenses, unified surcharges for garrison troops, militia expenses, militia land taxes, en route regimental fees, river defense fees, public security fees, shore inspection fees, reed merchant fees, new reed fees, rural cleansing fees, reed transport goods donations, ship donations, consolidation fees, unified donations, export taxes, new import taxes, road donations, parity fees, evaluation fees, additional stamp duties, Chinese-funded school fees, education donations, chamber of commerce donations, commercial fees, judicial expenses, etc., as well as temporary loans from the army (borrowed but not repaid), increased the salt tax, so that the amount of salt tax per dan had to exceed at least twice the salt cost.
　　After liberation, the Southwest Salt Affairs Bureau, under the policy of "no double taxation" and "collection at the site," has abolished all the miscellaneous taxes and levies of the past. However, some salt merchants and salt producers still believe that the tax is heavy. The reasons are: in the past, taxes were paid sporadically, but now they are collected at one time; in the past, smuggling and tax evasion were possible to make huge profits, but now smuggling and tax evasion are strictly prohibited, and only "profitable" can be achieved; in addition, salt merchants were exploited by bureaucratic capital in the past, and after liberation, they were unwilling to take out capital due to ideological concerns, and the obstruction of transportation by bandits and special agents caused delays, which further increased the difficulty of capital turnover.
　　Solving Difficulties and Increasing Tax Sources
　　Indeed, public and private industry and commerce are facing difficulties today, and salt merchants are also facing difficulties, which need to be adjusted. The South Sichuan Salt Administration Bureau has taken appropriate measures to help salt merchants solve the current temporary difficulties in capital turnover, ensure government revenue, reduce issuance, and stabilize salt prices. In well and stove operation and sales, originally because "the field price is low and the cost is high," and field merchants are in urgent need of expenses, they often sell at less than one-half of the cost, which affects commercial transport and field production, and reduces tax sources. South Sichuan has adopted the method of registering inventory, supplying raw materials, and signing purchase contracts to initially block the black market; it has also helped wells and stoves reduce costs, and gradually increase salt prices. For example, in March, the Changyan field price in Zigong was increased from 8.7 sheng of rice per dan to 21.43 shi sheng of rice; the salt price in Jianle Erchang was increased from 5 shi dou of rice per dan to 8 shi dou, so that field merchants can gradually achieve "break-even with small profits" and be profitable.
　　However, the law of increasing salt tax over the years is "determining tax based on sales," and sales depend on transportation conditions and people's purchasing power. If salt transport is not smooth and sales are stagnant, it will inevitably affect tax revenue. Since the liberation of Sichuan, bandits and special agents have not been completely eliminated, and the transportation and sales of Sichuan salt are difficult, forming serious phenomena such as short sales, short production, short tax, and smuggling and tax evasion. It has also created a situation where there is a surplus of salt in the production area and a salt shortage in the sales area. In the first quarter, 70% of the salt ordered by the South Sichuan Salt Field to Guizhou and West Sichuan was piled up in the salt field and could not be transported out, and the salt stored by transport merchants was also more than 500,000 dan; and Guizhou and West Sichuan experienced a serious salt shortage because they could not buy salt. In many villages, the demand for salt is higher than the demand for currency. Even in Guiyang and Chengdu, the main material that leads the rise and fall of prices is salt, and the best-selling is also salt. Five professional companies in Chengdu sell 300 million yuan of goods a day; while 20 retail stores sell 900 million yuan of salt. Armed escort has now been implemented, and after the transportation and sales are smooth, this abnormal phenomenon will gradually change. The Southwest Salt Affairs Bureau has also drafted a method for local salt bureaus to adopt the method of public salt merchants and salt tying up and traveling together when transporting salt, in order to achieve joint transportation and sales between public and private, and help commercial salt also obtain sales, so as to increase tax sources. If transportation costs can be further reduced in the future, and the feudal rotation system can be abolished, the burden on people's food and commercial transportation can be further reduced to ensure tax sources.
　　Strengthening Anti-Smuggling and Eliminating Tax Evasion
　　Another problem that poses the greatest direct threat to salt tax is that private sales have impacted formal sales. Smuggling was originally an extremely common thing under the collusion of officials, merchants, landlords, ruffians and gangsters during the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. After liberation, these people who made a fortune by speculation continued to do evil. In Sichuan, there have even been incidents of armed smuggling and robbing field affairs offices. At the same time, many salt producers and field merchants in various places, in order to evade taxes and get rid of their hands early, either exchanged salt for firewood and rice to pay wages, or transported them in large quantities. As a result, smuggled salt is rampant in markets everywhere. More than 80% of the residents in Zigong City eat smuggled salt, and more than 100 dan of smuggled salt is sold every day in Yunyang and Daning in eastern Sichuan. There was once as much as 800 dan of smuggled salt in Chongqing. Therefore, it has caused a serious phenomenon of private sales impacting formal sales and the market price being lower than the listed price. For example, the wholesale price of salt in Chengdu is 14,000 yuan per catty, and the retail price is only 9,000 yuan, while smuggled salt is as low as 2,000 yuan.
　　In anti-smuggling work, North Sichuan, East Sichuan, and South Sichuan have seized a lot of smuggled salt at some important ports. North Sichuan cracked 528 cases in January and February, and seized 158,494 catties of smuggled salt; South Sichuan seized more than 72,000 catties of smuggled salt in the first quarter. However, because the salt affairs cadres in various places have not clearly realized that salt tax is the most reliable income of the country, and have not carried out anti-smuggling work regularly and with emphasis, the number of salt seized only accounts for a little more than one-quarter of the smuggled salt tax. After the National Financial Conference in February, cadres in various places clarified the importance of taxation in their understanding. The North Sichuan Administrative Office also decided to resolutely crack down on armed smugglers, severely punish those who lead the smuggling, and confiscate and fine those who echo them. Leading cadres in various counties also guaranteed that local armed forces and public security forces could help anti-smuggling. After the Sui Ning garrison seized dozens of catties of salt every day, they also sent them to the field affairs office from a long distance. The Santai District of North Sichuan publicized the anti-smuggling policy through the People's Congress of all sectors, and Yunyang of East Sichuan publicized the anti-smuggling policy through the symposium of salt producers and salt workers, and launched salt workers in various salt fields to automatically organize inspection teams; the salt producers also formed a joint security group of five households and formulated their own discipline. Therefore, since April, smuggled salt has been reduced a lot, and more than 1,000 catties of smuggled salt have been seized in 20 days. The daily smuggled salt in Yunyang, East Sichuan, has been reduced by 90%. The salt production has gradually increased, and it has increased from 50% of the production amount to 80%. Tax revenue is also gradually increasing.

　　盐税与缉私
    江横
    四川重要税源之一
    西南四川、西康、云南等省均为产盐地区，其中尤以四川岩盐最负盛名，产量亦甚丰富，年产高达八百万担，供给川省民食之余，还可输出省外一部，故盐税收入向为川省赋税收入的大宗。解放以前，曾因无数苛捐杂征，如军费、军政费、驻军统一附加、团练经费、团练落地税、沿途团费、江防费、治安费、查岸费、芦商费、新加芦费、清乡费、芦运货捐、船捐、整理费、统捐、出口税、新加进口税、马路捐、平价费、评议费、附加印花、中资学费、学务捐、商会商捐、商费、司法经费等等，以及军队临时借款（借而不还），加重了盐税，使每担盐税额至少要超过盐本二倍以上。
    解放后，西南盐务局在“税不重征”、“就场征收”的方针下，已把过去名目繁多的苛捐杂征附加一律取消，但仍有一部分盐商、灶户认为税重，原因是：过去是零星征纳，现在是一次征收；过去可以走私漏税，牟取暴利，现在则是严禁走私漏税，只能做到“有利可图”；加以盐商过去受了官僚资本的剥削，解放后又因思想顾虑，不愿拿出资本，以及土匪特务障碍交通、运输而致迟滞，更增加了资金流转的困难等等。
    解决困难增加税源
    的确，今天公私工商业都是有困难的，盐商也是有困难的，都需加以调整。川南盐管局就曾采取了适当的办法，帮助盐商解决目前暂时资金周转的困难，也保证了政府收入，减少了发行，稳定了盐价。而在井灶经营和运销上，本来因“场价低，成本高”，场商又急需开支，往往低于成本二分之一脱售，影响了商运场产，减少了税源。川南曾采取了登记存货，供给原料、订立收购合同的办法，初步堵塞了黑市；又帮助井灶减低成本，并逐渐提高盐价，如三月间自贡仓盐场价，由每担八升七合米提高到二一·四三市升米；犍乐二场盐价，由每担五市斗米提到八市斗，使场商可以逐渐达到“保本薄息”，有利可图。
    但是，历年来增加盐税的规律是“以销定税”，销又决定于运输的条件和人民的购买力。如果盐运不畅、销路滞塞，必致影响税收。四川自解放以来，土匪特务尚未肃清，川盐运销困难，形成了短销、短产、短税和走私漏税等的严重现象。并造成产区盐过剩，销区盐荒的情况。川南盐场第一季度订给贵州、川西的盐，曾有百分之七十堆存在盐场运不出去，运商存盐也在五十万担以上；而贵州、川西因买不到盐而发生了严重的盐荒。在很多乡村里，盐的需求是高过于货币的需求的。甚至在贵阳、成都物价带头涨落的主要物资是盐，销路最旺的也是盐。成都五家专业公司一天销货三亿元；而二十家零售店，则销盐达九亿元。现已实行武装护运，待运销畅通后，将可逐渐改变这一畸形的现象。西南盐务局亦已拟定各地盐局在运盐时采取公盐商盐结帮同行的办法，以达到公私兼运兼销，帮助商盐亦能得到销路，以增税源。如果今后再能减低运输成本，取消封建的轮当制度，还可进一步减轻民食商运的负担，以保证税源。
    加强缉私杜绝偷漏
    对盐税直接威胁最大的另一问题，便是私销冲了正销。走私原为过去国民党反动统治时代官商地痞流氓相互勾结下极为普通的事情。解放后，这些靠投机发财自肥的人们，还在继续为非作歹。在四川甚至有武装走私与抢场务所的事情发生。同时各地很多灶户场商，为了逃税、早脱手，不是以盐换柴换米，抵交工资，便是大批贩运。因之私盐充斥各地市场。自贡市有百分之八十以上的居民吃着私盐，川东之云阳、大宁每日走私盐均在一百担以上。重庆有一次走私之盐多至八百担。故造成私销冲正销和市价低于牌价的严重现象。如成都每斤盐批发价是一万四千元，零售价只九千元，私盐则低到二千元。
    在缉私工作上，川北、川东、川南曾在一些重要岸口查获了不少的私盐。川北一二月份破案五二八次，缉获私盐十五万八千四百九十四斤；川南第一季度缉获私盐七万二千余斤。但由于各地盐务干部没有明确认识到盐税是国家最可靠的收入，没有经常的有重点的进行缉私工作，所以查获盐数，仅占走私盐税的四分之一强。二月全国财政会议后，各地干部认识上才明确税收的重要。川北行署并决定对武装走私者坚决打击，领头走私者从严惩办，附和者没收罚款。各县领导干部也保证地方武装、公安部队都能帮助缉私。遂宁驻军每天缉获几十斤盐后也远道送到场务所。川北三台区通过各界人民代表会，川东云阳通过灶户盐工座谈会，宣传了缉私政策，并在各盐场发动盐工，自动组织了纠查队；灶户们也五家一组的成立了连环保，自订了纪律。所以从四月份以来，私盐已减少很多，二十天查获私盐千余斤。川东云阳每天走私盐已减少百分之九十。使盐的产量逐渐提高，现已由产额的百分之五十增到了百分之八十。税收亦在逐渐增加中。
