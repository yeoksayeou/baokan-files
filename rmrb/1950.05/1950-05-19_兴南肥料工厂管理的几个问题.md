　　Several Problems in the Management of the Xingnan Fertilizer Factory
　　Ding Xuesong
　　The Xingnan Fertilizer Factory is the largest chemical factory in North Korea. Last November, the factory completed its production plan of 280,000 tons of ammonium sulfate fertilizer ahead of schedule. By the end of the year, it had overfulfilled the additional plan by 40,000 tons. In the first quarter of this year (the first three months), the production volume has been increased to 360 percent of that in 1946, and the quality (nitrogen content in the fertilizer) has been increased to 20.75 percent, while the highest in the Japanese imperialist era was only 20.4 percent (the world's highest record is 21 percent). Because the factory's annual production performance has consistently ranked first among all factories in North Korea, it has been repeatedly awarded by the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly of Korea and the Cabinet.

            I. Competition and Rewards
    The factory's production success is inseparable from a correct competition and reward system. One of the characteristics of their current competition movement is that it has developed from a top-down, shock-style competition in the past to a bottom-up, regular competition. Before last year, they launched a one- or two-month shock production campaign on major commemorative festivals (such as "May 1st" and "August 15th"), in order to strengthen the workers' political awareness and improve labor efficiency. However, such shock movements often led to temporary over-tension among workers, with attention being paid to completing quantity at the expense of protecting machinery and product quality, and once the shock period was over, there would be relaxation. To overcome this shortcoming, the factory adopted a new approach. In March and April last year, competitions were launched between sections within departments, and in May and June, they were expanded to competitions between departments. After July, the scope of departments and sections was eliminated, and it was reduced to mutual competition between 375 production teams. Below the teams, there was competition between individuals, striving to be elected as "Model Worker of the Month." Since the beginning of this year, this movement has expanded into simultaneous two-sided competition between individuals, teams, sections, and departments. Using the above various forms, from March of last year to the present, all of the factory's more than 9,000 workers and technicians have been organized into the high tide of a regular competition movement, overcoming the fluctuating phenomenon of workers' emotions in the past. This can be illustrated by the fact that the factory's overall worker attendance rate has increased from 94 percent in March of last year to the current 97.5 percent without declining.

    Another characteristic of the factory's current competition movement, which is also an important reason why the competition movement can maintain a regular basis at a higher level, is the combination of the competition movement with rationalization proposals and the creation of new technologies. The factory's biggest difficulties are aging machinery (machines in the chemical industry generally need to be replaced or repaired after only ten years, but the factory's machines have been used for more than twenty years) and a shortage of parts. These difficulties cannot be solved by increasing the labor intensity of workers. Therefore, the factory called on all workers to use their brains and develop their creativity, relying not only on enthusiasm, but also on their own wisdom to solve these difficulties. Since the call was made in 1947, there have been many achievements, but last year's achievements were even greater. For example, a problem that has existed since the factory was built and has not been solved is that every summer, due to the hot weather, the decomposition of nitrogen is unsuccessful, the output of nitrogen is reduced, and thus the production of the entire fertilizer is affected. We can see from the factory's production charts that before last year, the production ratio in June, July, and August each year was on the lowest line. In order to solve this basic problem, last year the Nitrogen Gas Section, centered on the Kim Chang-soo Team, under the guidance of the Soviet technician Monimayakov, boldly renovated twelve nitrogen decomposition machine boxes (CASE), expanded the stone mold drying yard, and, at the suggestion of the veteran worker Li Ying-xie, installed nine high-pressure coolers (which were not installed in the Japanese era) from February to May for more than three months. After this transformation, the temperature can be maintained normally throughout the year, so not only is the production of nitrogen guaranteed not to be affected in the summer, but the standard production volume per hour of each nitrogen decomposition machine has also increased from 750 cubic meters to 850 cubic meters; the purity of nitrogen has increased from 97 percent to 99.5 percent; the machine operation rate has increased by 36 percent compared to the previous year; and the problem of the annual summer production decline has been fundamentally solved, enabling the fertilizer production in 1949 to achieve unprecedented success. Another example is the Lee Jae-heung Team of the Sulfuric Acid Section, which reduced the sulfur content in the slag of pyrite ore smelting to 0.62 percent (the standard is 4 percent), and created an unprecedented new record for the entire factory, utilizing 100 percent of the raw materials and reducing costs. Another example is Li Ying-soo of the Electrode Department, who, after many experiments, finally successfully used glass rods as raw materials to manufacture glass wool, solving the problem of importing important materials for manufacturing mobile storage batteries from foreign countries during the Japanese imperialist era. There are many examples of technical improvements and new proposals like the above. In last year alone, there were 286 people (of whom 17 received the Order of Labor Merit from the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, and 63 received bonuses from the Ministry of Industry).

    What methods does the Xingnan Factory use to reward these new innovators and model workers? The standard for rewards is determined based on the quality and quantity of production according to the conditions of the competition, cost reduction, attendance rate, machinery utilization rate, and labor protection. There are two types of rewards:

    (1) Honorary Awards: In front of the factory and the doors of each department and section, we can see large competition bulletin boards made of wooden grids. On them, airplanes, trains, cars, motorcycles, bicycles, horses, mules, cattle, and tortoises are drawn in five colors, with "130% or more" written below the airplanes and "90% or less" written below the tortoises. Above the drawings are hung the signs of each department (the section signs are hung on the department's bulletin board, and the team signs are hung on the section's bulletin board), which are revealed once a day according to the performance of each department, section, and team, and broadcast to the entire factory by radio. In addition, the factory produces victory flags, victory plaques, and silver shields of victory, which are circulated monthly to model departments, model sections, and model teams.

    (2) Material Rewards: The factory director presents bonuses once a month at the meeting of activists convened by the trade union. The amount of the bonus (taking February of this year as an example): the first-class model worker receives one month's salary, the second-class receives 60%, and the third-class receives 30%. The bonus for a model team: a special prize of 2,000 won per person for the whole team, and 500 won for the first-class; the model department receives 100 won per person for the entire department; the model section receives 40 won per person for the entire section (all of the above have second and third classes). If a person is a model worker in a model department, a model section, and a model team, then he can receive four levels of bonuses. From March to December last year, some ordinary workers received 10,000 won in bonuses, which is equal to one time their salary. Kim Young-wa (an ordinary worker during the Japanese imperialist era), the head of the ammonium sulfate department, invented four new proposals last year, all of which were successfully tested, and thus received the Order of Labor Merit from the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly and a watch, clothes, and cash worth more than 20,000 won from the Ministry of Industry. According to the factory's statistics, more than 3,000 workers in the entire factory receive awards each month, accounting for one-third of all workers.

    Where does the bonus, which is a large expenditure, come from? The government stipulates that each factory and mine shall extract 50% of the profits from increasing production, improving quality, and reducing costs as the "factory director's fund." 40% of the "factory director's fund" is allocated to workers' welfare undertakings, and the remaining 60% is used as bonuses. This approach itself is rewarding. The Xingnan Factory's ability to fully reward workers is precisely the result of the factory's production improvement and cost reduction, and this result will in turn promote its production to be further improved and costs further reduced.

            II. Cultivating Technology and Promoting New Experiences
    The continuous emergence of new proposals and the continuous improvement of production efficiency are inseparable from the factory's efforts to cultivate workers' skills and promote new experiences. The Xingnan Factory has the following methods for training skilled workers:

    Technical Apprenticeship System: The factory's Technical Review Committee designates technicians to mentor apprentices according to needs. The master receives a monthly bonus of 150 won, and 70% is paid monthly during the apprenticeship period. The apprentice receives a monthly bonus of 100 won, and 50% is paid monthly during the study period. The remainder is paid when the study period expires and the exam is passed.

    Technical Lectures: Divided into two shifts, one each week (two hours). The upper shift is for skilled workers and is lectured by the engineer, with the content focusing on business theory. The lower shift is for apprentices and is lectured by the technician, with the content mainly focusing on operation methods and practical experience.

    Technical Research Presentation Meeting: Participants are technicians and assistant technicians, led by the chief technician, who specifically assigns someone to study a certain problem, and then presents the research experience to everyone. If workers have new suggestions and proposals, they are also brought to this meeting for research. Currently, the factory's technicians are working hard to learn Russian in order to study the advanced science and theory of the Soviet Union.

    In addition, four schools have been built in the factory, specifically to train technical cadres for the factory: Skilled Worker Training Institute: The target is high school graduates, who take classes for half a year and become skilled workers after graduation. Technical Night School: The target is on-the-job workers with a primary school education and graduates of the Skilled Worker Training Institute, who work during the day and study for three hours every night. The study period is three years, and they become assistant technicians after graduation. Technical Specialized Night School: The target is junior high school or Technical Night School graduates, who study for two hours every night. The study period is three years, and they become technicians after graduation. Higher Technical Training Institute: The target is high school or technical college graduates, with a study period of one year. After graduation, they can be tested as engineers after a certain period of internship.

    Due to the above efforts, more than half of the Xingnan Factory's 9,000 workers are now skilled workers, and there are 330 engineers and technicians. This is a large amount of capital. Currently, of the factory's more than 100 cadres, except for the factory director and individual cadres who are sent by higher authorities, all the rest are promoted from workers. Not only that, but the Xingnan Factory has also trained many political and technical cadres for the country. In last year alone, 478 cadres were transferred from the factory to work in various party and government agencies, mass organizations, and other factories.

            III. "One-Man Management System"

    The Xingnan Factory adopts a "one-man management system" (or factory director system) in its organizational leadership. The factory director is the absolute leader of the entire production activities of the factory. All workers in the factory must accurately complete his instructions and orders. On the other hand, the factory director must be fully responsible for all activities of the factory he leads and the production tasks he undertakes. The factory director Zhu Zhongxuan told reporters that the factory had undergone two or three years of struggle before initially establishing a truly "one-man management system" with strict discipline and clear responsibilities like today.

    Before 1947, the factory's administration, the Party, and mass organizations each governed themselves and led production. The factory director's orders could not be implemented, the responsibilities of superiors and subordinates were unclear, and discipline was lax. In 1948, the government ordered the implementation of the "one-man management system," but it went to another extreme, that is, cadres and workers at all levels thought in their minds that the "one-man management system" was to obey the factory director's orders in everything. Therefore, the enthusiasm of cadres and workers at all levels could not be better brought into play. It was not until last September, at the industrial economic departments and the conference of trade union activists, that Chairman Kim Il-sung made a correct summary and instructions. After that, each factory conducted in-depth self-criticism according to this instruction, and conducted communication and education from top to bottom, and conducted discussions from bottom to top, and now this system has been established relatively clearly. Due to the correct establishment of the "one-man management system," the factory's labor discipline and internal order have been significantly improved. The worker attendance rate has been unprecedentedly improved, eliminating the undisciplined phenomenon of absenteeism and tardiness without cause. The responsibilities of each department and workers between superiors and subordinates are very clear. For example, the factory implements a three-shift system (three shifts a day, eight hours per shift). When the upper and lower shifts hand over, the person taking over the shift inspects very carefully. If there is a machine failure or unclear procedures, he will definitely not take over; even after the takeover, the time and other losses spent on repairing the machine are the responsibility of the previous shift. For example, if a certain team could strive to be a model, but one of them does not abide by labor discipline and affects the performance of the whole team, the team will concentrate all its efforts to help the worker improve. Therefore, each team has a short criticism and self-criticism meeting after work every day to check all the advantages and disadvantages of the team that day, reward progress, and criticize backwardness.

    Departments also supervise each other. For example, between the gas department and the sulfuric acid department, the gas department has completed 100% of the ammonia production, but the sulfuric acid department's sulfuric acid production has only completed 80%. Then the sulfuric acid department should be fully responsible for the failure to complete the plan on time for the entire fertilizer production. Not only that, but also strengthened the joint responsibility with other related factories and mines. For example, the pyrite ore, an important raw material required by the Xingnan Factory, is responsible for supplying it by the Danchuan Mine. However, if the mine fails to supply it on time midway, which hinders the production of the Xingnan Factory, the Danchuan Mine should be fully responsible for the loss of the Xingnan Factory. If the Danchuan Mine has supplied it on time and in full quantity, but the railway department has not transported it on time, then the Hamnam Railway Administration must simultaneously be fully responsible to the Danchuan Mine and the Xingnan Factory. In this way, there is an invisible force of upward and downward supervision and mutual supervision between each link of the entire factory, each worker, and related factories and mines, and the task is completed seriously, on time, and accurately every day.

    According to Director Zhu, their experience in implementing the "one-man management system" is: First, the strong cooperation and consistent steps of the Party (referring to the Workers' Party), the administration, and mass organizations (trade unions, youth leagues, and women's federations) are the basic key to ensuring the implementation of the "one-man management system." The Party and mass organizations must ensure the establishment of the factory director's prestige, educate and organize workers to consciously and strictly abide by labor discipline, and obey the factory director's orders. Only in this way can all chaotic, complicated, and irresponsible phenomena be eliminated, and strict discipline be established. Second, the factory director must accurately formulate the plans for each quarter, month, ten days, and day according to the government's instructions and the various specific conditions of the factory, and correctly instruct the work of each department. Therefore, the factory director himself must be proficient in business and familiar with all the circumstances of the factory. Third, after the orders and instructions are issued, the leading cadres at all levels must personally go to the workshops to inspect and guide, and solve problems for the workers at any time (even small problems such as a lack of a nail). "Factory guidance" has now become the work slogan of all cadres in the Xingnan Factory. Fourth, the most important thing is that the factory director must maintain close contact with the masses, bring into play the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers, and strengthen self-criticism to avoid bureaucratic tendencies. To do this, the Xingnan Factory has adopted two forms in its organization, the "Production Coordination Committee" and the "Worker Activists Conference," to assist the "one-man management system." The "Production Coordination Committee" is a technical administrative coordination agency under the leadership of the factory director. It is composed of administrative, Party, trade union, youth league, and women's federation cadres, as well as technicians and model workers, to discuss all technical administrative matters related to the factory and recommend that the factory director implement them. The "Worker Activists Conference" is responsible by the trade union and is held once a month. The participating representatives are elected by the workers from the bottom up, and technicians, Party, government, and youth league and women's federation cadres also participate. The factory director reports on the production achievements of the month, the results of the competition, and presents bonuses and awards. At this meeting, representatives can freely express their opinions, make criticisms and suggestions for the leadership to adopt. If the factory director does not accept the suggestions of the Production Coordination Committee and the Worker Activists Conference, the workers must still obey unconditionally, but they can submit their dissenting opinions to the higher-level government for handling. Fifth, to implement the "one-man management system," in addition to strictly implementing the reward and punishment system, it is also necessary to care about the workers' material and cultural life and pay attention to the workers' welfare undertakings.

    Factory Director Zhu finally told reporters that the factory's goal for this year's production struggle is to maintain balanced development at the highest level that has been strived for last year, and rely on the factory's own strength to repair and expand more than 30 kinds of machine equipment, improve machine efficiency, and strive to exceed the highest level of 460,000 tons of ammonium sulfate fertilizer produced in 1939 during the Japanese imperialist era within this year.

　　兴南肥料工厂管理的几个问题
　　丁雪松
    兴南肥料工厂是北朝鲜最大的一个化学工厂。去年十一月，该厂提前完成了二十八万吨硫铵肥料的生产计划，至年底，还超额完成了四万吨的追加计划。今年第一季（前三个月）已将生产量提高到一九四六年的百分之三百六十，并将质量（肥料中氮的成份）提高到百分之二十·七五，而日帝时代最高仅达百分之二十·四（世界最高纪录为百分之二十一）。该厂因每年生产成绩均为北朝鲜各工厂之冠，曾数次荣获了朝鲜最高人民会议常任委员会与部长会议的褒奖。
            一、竞赛与奖励
    该厂生产的胜利，是与正确的竞赛与奖励制度分不开的。目前他们竞赛运动的特点之一，是已将过去自上而下的突击式的竞赛，发展成为自下而上的经常竞赛。去年以前，他们每逢大的纪念节（如“五一”、“八·一五”等），即发动一月或两月的突击生产，借以加强工人的政治觉悟和提高劳动效率。但这样的突击运动，往往会形成工人一时的过分紧张，为完成数量而不注意爱护机器和产品质量，并且突击期一过，即会松懈下来。为克服这一缺点，该厂采取了新的办法。去年三四月，以部为单位展开了科与科之间的竞赛，五六月又扩大为部与部之间的竞赛。七月以后，取消了部和科的范围，缩小为三百七十五个生产班之间的相互竞赛。在班的下面是个人与个人的竞赛，争取当选为“月中模范工人”。今年以来，这一运动扩大成为个人与个人，班与班，科与科，部与部之间的两面同时竞赛。用以上各种形式，从去年三月到现在，一直将全厂九千多名工人和技术人员，组织在经常的竞赛运动的高潮中，克服了过去工人情绪忽高忽低的波动现象。这从全厂工人的出勤率从去年三月的百分之九十四，提高到现在的百分之九十七·五，而一直没有下降这一事实，即可说明。
    该厂目前竞赛运动的另一特点，亦即竞赛运动能在较高的水平上保持经常的重要原因是：将竞赛运动与合理化建议和创造新技术结合起来。该厂的最大困难是机器衰老（化学工业方面的机器，一般只能用十年即需撤换或修整，但该厂的机器已经用了二十几年）和零件缺乏。这一困难是不能靠提高工人的劳动强度来解决的。因此，工厂号召全体工人开动脑筋，发挥创造性，不仅靠热情，而且还要以自己的智慧来解决这一困难。自一九四七年提出这一号召以来有了不少成绩，但去年的成绩更大。例如该工厂自建厂以来，就存在而一直没有解决的一个问题，是每年夏天因天气热，氮的分解不成功，氮的产量减少，因而影响整个肥料的生产。我们从该厂的生产图表中可以看出，去年以前每年六、七、八月的生产比率，都在最低的线上。为解决这一基本问题，去年氮气科以金昌洙班为中心，在苏联技师蒙伊马耀科夫的指导下，从二月至五月三个多月中，大胆地改造了十二台氮气分解机的盒子（ＣＡＳＥ），扩大了石模干燥场，并在老工人李膺燮的创议下，设置了九台高压冷却器（这是日本时代没有安设的）。经过这样改造以后，使一年四季的温度都能保持正常，因此，不仅保障了夏季氮的生产不受影响，而且还将每台氮气分解机每小时的标准生产量，从七百五十立方米提高到八百五十立方米；氮的纯度，从百分之九十七提高到百分之九十九·五；机器的运转率较前年提高了百分之三十六；从根本上解决了每年夏季生产必须下降的问题，使一九四九年的肥料生产取得了空前的胜利。又如硫酸科李在兴班，将炼硫化矿石的渣滓中的硫黄分降低到百分之零·六二（标准为百分之四），并创造了全厂空前的新纪录，百分之百地利用了原料，降低了成本。又如电极部的李英洙，经过多次试验，终于成功地利用玻璃棒作原料，制造玻璃绵，解决了日帝时代必须靠外国输入的，制造移动蓄电池的重要材料。像以上这样改进技术提出新创案的例子，是很多的。仅去年一年，即有二百八十六名（其中得到最高人民会议常任委员会功劳奖章的有十七名，得到工业部奖金的有六十三名）。
    兴南工厂用什么方法来奖励这些新创案者和模范工人呢？奖励的标准，是根据竞赛的条件生产的质和量、成本降低、出勤率、机械利用率和劳动保护等来决定。奖励的方法有两种：
    （一）名誉奖：我们在工厂和每一个部和科的门前，都可以看到用木格作成的大幅竞赛墙报。上面用五彩，画着飞机、火车、汽车、摩托车、自行车、马、骡子、牛、乌龟九幅图画，飞机下面写着百分之一三○以上、乌龟下面写着百分之九○以下，画的上面挂着各部（部的墙报上挂科、科的墙报上挂班）的牌子，每天根据各部、科、班的成绩分别揭示一次，并用无线电向全厂广播。此外由工厂制作优胜旗、优胜牌和胜利银盾，每月巡回发给模范部、模范科和模范班。
    （二）物质奖：每月在工会召开的积极分子会议上，由厂长颁发一次奖金。奖金数目（以今年二月为例）：一等模范工人为一个月的工资，二等六成，三等三成。模范班的奖金：特等全班每人二千元，一等五百元；模范部，一等全部每人一百元；模范科，一等全科每人四十元（以上均有二三等）。如果某人为模范部、模范科、模范班里的模范工人，那么，他即可连得四重奖金。去年从三月至十二月，有的普通工人得到一万元的奖金，等于其工资的一倍。硫铵部长金永洿（日帝时代的普通工人），去年共发明了四件新的创案，并都试验成功，因而得到最高人民会议常任委员会的功劳奖章，和产业部价值两万余元的手表、衣服和现金。据该工厂统计，每月全厂得奖的工人有三千多名，占全部工人的三分之一。
    奖金是一笔大的开支，从那里来呢？政府规定各工厂矿山从增加生产，提高质量与降低成本的利润中，抽出百分之五十作为“厂长基金”。“厂长基金”中百分之四十，拨给工人的福利事业，其余百分之六十即作为奖金。这一办法的本身，就带着奖励性。兴南工厂能充分的奖励工人，正是该工厂生产提高和成本降低的结果，而这一结果又将反过来促进他的生产更加提高和成本进一步减低。
            二、培养技术推广新经验
    新创案的接连出现与生产效率的不断提高，是与工厂竭力培养工人的技术和推广新经验的工作分不开的。兴南工厂培养技术工人的方法有以下几种：
    技术传习制：由工厂技术审查委员会根据需要，指定技工带徒弟。师傅一月奖金一百五十元，传习期间每月支百分之七十，学徒每月奖金一百元，学习期间每月支百分之五十，学习期满考试及格时，再领取其余部分。
    技术讲座：分上下两班，每周各一次（两小时）。上班听讲者为熟练工人，由机师讲授，内容偏重业务理论。下班听讲者为见习工，由技工讲授，内容主要为操作法和实际经验。
    技术研究发表会：参加者为技师和技手，由技师长领导，专门指定某人研究某一问题，届时向大家发表研究心得，工人中如有新建议和创案也提到这个会上研究。现该厂的技师为要研究苏联的先进科学和理论，正在努力学习俄文。
    此外，在工厂内建设了四个学校，专门替工厂培养技术干部：技能工养成所：对象为高中毕业生，受课半年，毕业后为技能工。技术夜校：对象为在职工人中有高小程度的工人和技能工养成所的毕业生，白天工作，每晚学习三小时，修业期间三年，毕业后成为准技手。技术专门夜校：对象为初中或技术夜校毕业生，每晚学习两小时，修业期间三年，毕业后成为技手。高等技术养成所：对象为高中或技专毕业生，修业期间一年，毕业后经过一定时期的实习，可考为技师。
    由于以上各种努力，兴南工厂九千余名工人中，现已有半数以上技能工，三百三十名技师和技手。这是一笔大的资本。现该工厂上下一百多名干部中，除厂长和个别干部是上级派来的而外，其余全部都是从工人中提拔出来的。不仅如此，兴南工厂还为国家培养了不少政治和技术干部，仅去年一年，从该厂调派到各处党政机关和群众团体与别的工厂去工作的干部，即达四百七十八名。
            三、“单一管理制”
    兴南工厂在组织领导上采取“单一管理制”（或厂长制）。厂长是工厂生产的整个活动的绝对领导者。他的指示和命令，全厂工人必须准确地完成。另一方面，厂长对其所领导的工厂的一切活动及所负担的生产任务，必须负完全责任。该厂长朱钟宣告诉记者，该厂曾经过两三年的斗争，才初步建立起了像今天这样纪律严密、责任分明的名符其实的“单一管理制”。
    一九四七年以前，该厂行政、党、群众团体各自为政，都领导生产。厂长命令不能贯彻，上下责任不明，纪律松懈。一九四八年政府下令要实行“单一管理制”，但又走到另一偏向，即各级干部与工人在思想上认为，“单一管理制”就是一切服从厂长的命令。因此，各级干部和工人的积极性，未能更好地发挥。直到去年九月，在产业经济部门和工会积极分子大会上，金日成主席作了正确的总结和指示以后，各工厂根据这一指示，深刻地作了检讨，并且自上而下的进行了传达教育，又自下而上地进行了讨论，现在才比较明确地将这一制度建立起来。由于“单一管理制”的正确建立，工厂的劳动纪律和内部秩序均有了显著的改进。工人的出勤率空前提高，消灭了无故缺勤和迟到的无纪律现象。上下各部与工人相互之间，责任十分明确。例如，该厂实施三交代制（每日分三班，每班八小时）。在上下两班交接时，接班的人检查得非常认真，如机器有故障或手续不清，一定不接；即是接收后，因修理机器所费的时间和其他损失，概由上一班负责。又如某班本可争取模范，但因其中一人不遵守劳动纪律影响了全班的成绩时，该班必将集中全力来帮助这一工人的改进。所以各班每天下工后，都有短时间的批评检讨会，借以检查当天全班的一切优缺点，奖励进步，批评落后。
    部与部之间也互相监督，如瓦斯部与硫酸部之间，瓦斯部已百分之百地完成了氨的生产，但硫酸部的硫酸生产却只完成了百分之八十，那么硫酸部对整个肥料的生产不能按时完成计划应负完全责任。不仅如此，与别的有关厂矿之间也加强了连带责任。例如兴南工厂所需的重要原料硫化矿石，是由端川矿山负责供给。但如中途该矿没有准时供给而阻碍了兴南工厂的生产，则端川矿山对兴南工厂的损失，应负完全责任。假如端川矿山已按期如数地供给了，而铁路部门没有按期运到，则咸南铁道管理局必须同时对端川矿山与兴南工厂，负完全责任。这样一来，整个工厂的每一环节每个工人以及有关厂矿之间，无形中有了上下监督、互相监督的力量，每天严肃地按时准确完成任务。
    据朱厂长谈：他们实行“单一管理制”的经验是：第一，党（按指劳动党）、行政与群众团体（工、青、妇）的有力配合，步调一致，是保证“单一管理制”实施的基本关键。党与群众团体必须保证建立厂长的威信，教育组织工人自觉地严格遵守劳动纪律，服从厂长的命令。这样才能消除一切混乱繁杂及不负责的现象，建立起严格的纪律。第二，厂长必须根据政府的指示和本厂的各种具体条件，精密地作出每季每月每旬每日的计划，正确地指示各部门的工作，因此厂长本身必须精通业务，熟悉工厂的一切情形。第三，命令指示发出后，各级领导干部必须亲身到工场去检查指导，随时替工人解决问题（那怕是如缺少一个钉子一样的小问题）。“工厂指导”现在已成为兴南工厂全体干部的工作口号。第四，最重要的一项是厂长必须和群众保持紧密联系，发挥工人的积极性和创造力，加强自我批评以避免官僚主义的倾向。为作到这一点，兴南工厂在组织上采取了“生产协议会”和“工人积极分子会议”两种形式以协助“单一管理制”。“生产协议会”是厂长领导下的一个技术行政协议机关。由行政、党、工、青、妇干部与技师、模范工人组成，讨论有关工厂的一切技术行政事项，建议厂长执行。“工人积极分子会议”，由工会负责，每月召开一次。参加代表由工人自下而上选举，技师、党、政与工青妇干部亦参加，由厂长报告一月的生产成绩，竞赛结果，并颁发奖金奖状。在这个会上，代表们可以自由发表意见，提出批评和建议供领导上采纳。如厂长不接受生产协议会和工人积极分子会议的建议时，工人仍须无条件服从，但可将不同意见提交上级政府处理。第五，要贯彻“单一管理制”，除须严格实行奖惩制度而外，还必须关心工人的物质文化生活，注意工人的福利事业。
    朱厂长最后告诉记者，该厂今年生产奋斗的目标，是在去年已争取的最高水平上保持均衡发展，并依靠该厂自己的力量，补修和扩充三十余种机器设备，提高机器效能，争取今年之内，超过日帝时代一九三九年生产硫铵肥料四十六万吨的最高水平。
