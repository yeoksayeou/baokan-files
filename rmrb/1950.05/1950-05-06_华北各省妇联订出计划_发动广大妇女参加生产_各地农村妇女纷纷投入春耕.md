The North China Provincial Women's Federations Set Plans
Mobilizing Broad Masses of Women to Participate in Production; Rural Women Everywhere Throw Themselves into Spring Plowing

[This newspaper dispatch] The women's federations of various provinces in North China have formulated women's work plans one after another, mobilizing the broad masses of women to participate in agricultural production. In many areas, large numbers of women have already joined in spring plowing. In early March, Hebei Province convened a women's representative meeting. Based on the foundation of last year's work and the provincial government's agricultural production plan for this year, it was decided that vigorously mobilizing women to participate in field production would be the central task of women's movement work this year. In old liberated areas, it is also necessary to further improve women's production technology, and to lead and organize the broad masses of women through production models and labor heroes. The Chahar Provincial Women's Federation plans to mobilize 80 percent of women in the old areas and 40 percent in the new areas to participate in production. In addition to agricultural production, it also plans to complete the task of raising 560,000 pigs and 1 million chickens. The Shanxi Provincial Women's Federation plans to mobilize 30 percent of women to regularly participate in major agricultural labor and earnestly learn and master production technology. In addition to systematically undertaking certain agricultural production tasks, ordinary women will also develop and improve handicrafts such as silkworm rearing, mat weaving, and fruit tree cultivation. The Suiyuan Provincial Women's Federation Preparatory Committee decided to widely publicize the government's policy of rewarding Mongolian women for participating in agricultural and animal husbandry production in agricultural and pastoral areas, while in general areas it advocates that women learn and participate in agricultural labor.

In order to ensure the realization of the above plans, Hebei, Shanxi, Chahar and other provinces have made arrangements for extensive publicity and education work. It was also proposed to carry out maternal and child health work and implement the new Marriage Law to solve women's family, children, and disease problems. At the same time, it was emphasized that the women's representative meeting should be fully utilized to mobilize and organize women. The Chahar Provincial Women's Federation also decided to establish and convene women's representative meetings at all levels, making them a regular organization for leading women's production. The Hebei Provincial Women's Federation has dispatched responsible cadres to Tangshan, Handan, and Baoding special districts to inspect women's spring plowing production and assist local areas in completing the first season's production tasks.

Currently, women everywhere have gone to the fields to actively carry out various spring plowing activities. In Zhengzhuang, Anping, Hebei, 70 percent of the women are participating in hoeing wheat and eliminating pests, having hoed more than 1,300 mu of wheat seedlings and using 12 sprayers to eliminate red spiders on 21 mu of wheat seedlings. In Xuanhua, Huairen and other counties in Chahar, a large number of women have participated in soaking seeds, delivering manure, and picking up stubble. Women in Shaling and other villages in Xuanhua have picked up stubble on nearly 1,000 mu. In the plains of Shenxian County, the third district has more than 3,000 women in the fields, with some villages having more than 70 percent of women in the fields.

　　华北各省妇联订出计划
    发动广大妇女参加生产  各地农村妇女纷纷投入春耕
    【本报讯】华北各省妇联纷纷制订妇女工作计划，发动广大妇女参加农业生产，许多地区已有大量妇女参加春耕。河北省于三月上旬召开了妇女代表会，根据去年工作基础和省府今年农业生产计划，决定以大力发动妇女参加田间生产为今年妇运工作中心任务。在老区还要进一步提高妇女生产技术，并通过生产模范、劳动英雄等来带领和组织广大妇女。察哈尔省妇联计划发动老区百分之八十，新区百分之四十的妇女参加生产。并计划在农业生产外，完成养猪五十六万只、养鸡百万只的任务。山西省妇联计划发动百分之三十的妇女经常参加主要农业劳动，并认真学会和掌握生产技术。一般妇女除有计划地分担一定的农业生产任务外，并进行发展和改进养蚕、编席、栽培果树等手工副业。绥远省妇联筹委会决定在农牧区广泛宣传政府奖励蒙民妇女参加农、牧业生产的政策，一般地区则提倡妇女学习和参加农业劳动。
    为了保证上述计划的实现，河北、山西、察哈尔等省均分别布置了广泛的宣传教育工作。并提出开展妇婴卫生工作，贯彻新婚姻法，以解决妇女的家庭、小孩、疾病等问题。同时，强调充分利用妇女代表会来发动组织妇女。察哈尔省妇联并决定建立和召开各级妇代会议，使之成为经常的领导妇女生产的机关。河北省妇联已抽派负责干部分赴唐山、邯郸、保定专区检查妇女春耕生产，协助各地完成第一季生产任务。
    现各地妇女已纷纷下地，积极进行各种春耕活动，河北安平郑庄已有百分之七十的妇女参加锄麦、灭虫，共锄完一千三百多亩麦苗，并使用十二架喷雾器，消灭二十一亩麦苗地的红蜘蛛。察哈尔宣化、怀仁等县已有大批妇女参加浸种、送粪、拾茬子等；宣化沙岭等村妇女已拾茬近一千亩，平原莘县三区已有三千余妇女下地，有的村妇女下地的达百分之七十以上。
