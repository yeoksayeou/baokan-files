    Individual Soldiers Violate Mass Discipline
    Relevant Troops Apologize and Compensate the Masses
    Farmers of Xisikuaiyu Village Express Satisfaction in Letter
    On April 3rd, we received a letter from Zhao Guishun and Yang Wenying, the security team leaders of Xisikuaiyu Village outside Chongwenmen, Beijing, representing the residents of the village, regarding opinions on certain soldiers of the 3rd Company, 1st Battalion of the × Regiment under the North China Military Region Command stationed in the Temple of Heaven, who violated mass discipline. We immediately sent a reporter to the village to understand the situation and concluded that the facts and opinions raised by Comrades Zhao and Yang were correct. We then forwarded their letter, along with another reader's letter regarding a similar violation of mass discipline by troops formerly stationed near Shawopu Village in the suburbs of Beijing, to the Political Department of the North China Military Region for investigation and handling. We have now received a letter from the Political Department of the North China Military Region stating: "The two reader letters previously sent both concern the issue of troops violating mass discipline. One involves troops directly under the Military Region stationed at the Temple of Heaven, and we have instructed them to conduct a review. We are now sending a report from the Political Department of that regiment, and the masses are generally satisfied with the handling measures. Please publish it to educate the troops. The other involves troops under the Public Security Division, and we have forwarded the original to the Public Security Forces for investigation and reply. We feel that the newspaper's serious and responsible attitude is of great educational significance to our troops. We hope that in the future, you will reflect more on the opinions of the masses about the troops in order to strengthen the relationship between the army and the people."
    We are now publishing the opinion letter from Comrades Zhao Guishun and Yang Wenying of Xisikuaiyu Village, the inspection report from the Political Department of the × Regiment, the reply letter from the Political Department of the Central Column of the Public Security Forces regarding the inspection of the discipline of the troops stationed in Shawopu Village in the suburbs of Beijing, and the public letter from the masses of Xisikuaiyu Village after the troops apologized and compensated for their actions.

    个别战士违反群众纪律
    有关部队向群众道歉赔偿
    西四块玉村农民来信表示满意
    四月三日，我们收到北京崇文门外西四块玉村治安组长赵桂顺、杨文英代表该村居民对驻扎天坛的华北军区司令部所辖×团一营三连某些战士违反群众纪律的意见信。我们当即派记者去该村了解情况，认为赵、杨两同志，所举出的事实和提出的意见是正确的，即将他们的信件以及关于原驻京郊沙窝村附近部队同样违反群众纪律的另一读者来信转请华北军区政治部调查处理。顷接到华北军区政治部来信称：“前送来读者来信两年，均属部队违反群众纪律问题。一为驻天坛的军区直辖部队，我们已指示他们进行检查。兹送上该团政治处的报告一件，其处理办法，群众尚称满意，请予刊登，以便教育部队。另一件为公安师所辖部队，已将原件转请公安部队查复。我们感到报纸这种认真负责态度，对我们部队有很大的教育意义，希望今后多反映群众对部队意见，以密切军民关系。”
    现在我们把西四块玉村赵桂顺、杨文英两同志的意见信、×团政治处检查报告、公安部队中央纵队政治部关于检查京郊沙窝村驻军纪律复信以及西四块玉村群众对部队进行道歉赔偿后的公开信一并发表于后。
