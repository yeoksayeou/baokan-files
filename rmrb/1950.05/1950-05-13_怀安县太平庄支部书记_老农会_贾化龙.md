　　Secretary of the Taipingzhuang Branch in Huaian County
　　“Old Farmers' Association”——Jia Hualong
　　Wang Xuan
    Jia Hualong, the secretary of the Taipingzhuang Village Branch in Huaian County, Chahar Province, is active in his work and democratic in his style. He has put a lot of effort into mastering policies and leading various tasks, especially in leading agricultural production, and has achieved good results. The villagers trust and love him. Because he served as the director of the village farmers' association when Huailai was first liberated in 1946, the villagers affectionately call him "Old Farmers' Association." In fact, he is only a strong man of forty-seven years old.
    Last summer, the crops suffered severely from "stem borers," and the masses were pessimistic and disappointed, saying there was "no way out," and some were superstitious about the "worm king." Jia Hualong, on the one hand, explained to the masses not to be superstitious and not to despair, and on the other hand, worked hard to study the problem, losing sleep for several days. One day, he suddenly discovered by the roadside that the "stem borer" seedlings that had been eaten off by donkeys and horses had grown new shoots. He speculated, "Since new shoots have grown, ears of grain will definitely grow." At that time, he first explained this fact and reasoning to the party members in the branch and mobilized them to take the lead in cutting and catching "stem borers," cutting short the seedlings with worms. As a result, new shoots really grew a few days later. Everyone was very happy, and the masses in the whole village also followed suit, cutting and catching worms on more than 20 mu per day. The branch then wrote songs on the blackboard newspaper to encourage the masses to participate in catching worms:
    "All the old farmers in the village, listen carefully to what I say, the green seedlings have been hoed and weeded, and they have already emerged from the ridges. Harmful insects are born in the heart of the grain, and superstition blames the heavens, but in reality, the thinking is wrong, and the seedlings are withering and no one dares to manage them. Branch Secretary Jia Hualong organized a worm-catching team. Street chiefs and group leaders, party members and youth league members, started that day, and even children went to help. Catching by hand and holding scissors, twenty mu a day, finishing the catching in the evening. Everyone said it was good, and the seedlings grew happily. Old farmers went to the fields together, and everyone went to cut the worms, and in less than a week, everyone moved forward together. Cadres took the lead in this good work, ensuring good seedlings, and a full barn in the autumn harvest. Whoever doesn't go to the fields will regret it in the autumn. No matter old or young, hurry to the fields to get rid of all the insects, and this year will be a bumper year."
    The autumn harvest was as good as usual, and Lao Jia's prestige among the masses became even higher.
    Last year, during the rainy season, when planting trees, the masses couldn't accept it, saying, "They won't survive if planted without bark." Lao Jia first mobilized the branch party members to personally plant trees, even with their families, to influence others. His wife took their sick child to the field to plant trees, and the villagers were very moved, saying, "The Jia family is planting trees even with a sick child, why shouldn't we go?" The next day, most of the villagers, both men and women, also started planting. In this way, in Taipingzhuang, a village of 432 households with 2,068 people, more than 160,000 trees were planted last rainy season, and the survival rate was also very good - 60 to 70 percent or more.
    In any work, Jia Hualong always leads by example, goes deep into the masses, and guides and inspires them to do a good job. When a lazy man in his village slept in and didn't get up early, he was determined to transform him, but not by interfering or forcing him. Instead, he called out at the door in a concerned manner, "Brother, are you feeling unwell? Go see someone early, don't delay your health." This is how he encouraged the lazy people to pay attention to production, and it was very effective. During winter production, the masses proposed setting up a bell so that everyone could wake up at the same time, but they couldn't find even a small piece of steel rail in the whole village. At this time, Lao Jia volunteered to take on the responsibility of "shouting from the high ground" on the Miao Geda every morning. He persisted in this without interruption for more than forty days. One morning, Lao Jia felt so unwell that he fainted on the ground while shouting to wake everyone up. The farmers who got up early didn't hear Lao Jia's shouts, so they went to the Miao Geda to see what had happened. They saw Lao Jia lying on the ground and quickly called many people to carry Lao Jia home. The masses constantly went to see him and comfort him, asking him to rest well and treating him like a family member. But soon Lao Jia was back in production with them.
    Comrade Jia Hualong has a good relationship with the party members and the masses, but it is not just a matter of harmony. He is serious and conscientious, adheres to principles, and is patient in his persuasion. One of his successful experiences in leadership is to reward achievements. Last winter, when the village organized a hunting party, Cheng Hairong caught two foxes in five days, and he wrote a song on the blackboard newspaper to encourage him:
    "Villagers, pay attention, there is a Cheng Hairong in our village, he is sixty years old this year, he works harder than a young man, and he pays more attention to production, he wants to strive to be an old hero. He sleeps late at night and gets up at five o'clock, hunting for wild animals in the fields every day, killing foxes and wolves that harm livestock. He caught two foxes in five days and sold them to buy rice for his family's use, and his life is at a higher level. I hope that the villagers and old farmers will all act like this, and do whatever you can do, don't relax. Men and women in each street and group, see how glorious the old man is."
    Jia Hualong is a very good party propagandist. Whenever an important event occurs, he writes poems and songs with party members or the masses and publishes them on the blackboard newspaper to persuade and encourage the masses or to fight against the rumors of enemy agents. Last autumn, in order to promote the autumn harvest, they wrote an autumn harvest song:
    "Old farmers, pay attention, the five grains are ripe and the sorghum is red, quickly repair the farm tools and prepare them well, and prepare for the autumn harvest. Harvest the mung beans and cultivate quickly, so you will save effort next spring, harvesting the large fields takes more effort, men and women, young and old, work together. Cadres, call on the farmers, broadcast every day at five o'clock, harvest early and complete early, so that we don't have to worry. Persuade the lazy men and lazy women, they should work in the fields. Ten thousand words are not enough to say, don't relax about the autumn harvest."
    Later, according to the needs of the work, they also composed songs for developing sideline occupations, songs for transforming lazy men and lazy women, etc., which played a great role in promoting work and boosting the morale of the masses.
    Because of Comrade Jia Hualong's good leadership, the work of the Taipingzhuang Branch is always at the forefront. Last year, at the county party representative meeting, the branch was rated as a first-class model, and Jia Hualong was also rated as an excellent branch secretary.

　　怀安县太平庄支部书记
　  “老农会”——贾化龙
　　王宣
    察哈尔省怀安县太平庄村支部书记贾化龙，工作积极作风民主，在掌握政策，领导各种工作、特别是在领导农业生产方面下过不少苦心，获得很好的成绩。村中群众都信赖他爱戴他。因为他在一九四六年怀来第一次解放时当过村农会主任，所以村里人都亲热地喊他为“老农会”。其实他还只是四十七岁的壮年人。
    去年夏天，庄稼闹“钻心虫”很厉害，群众悲观失望表示“没办法”，有的迷信“虫王”。贾化龙一面向群众解释，不要迷信，不要失望，一面努力研究，几天睡不着觉。一天，忽然在路旁发见有驴马吃掉头的“钻心虫”禾苗又长出头来。他就推想“既又长出了头，就一定会长穗”。当时他就先在支部里同党员，讲明这个事实和道理。发动党员带头剪捉“钻心虫”。把有虫子苗头割短，结果几天后真的长出新禾头。大家非常欢喜，全村群众们也都跟着动起来，一天曾剪捉二十多亩。支部便在黑板报上编写了歌子，鼓动群众参加捉虫：
    “全村老农民，详细听我言，青苗锄耧过，已经出垅畔。谷心生害虫，迷信怨天年，实际思想错，苗枯不敢管。支书贾化龙，组织捉虫班。街长和组长，党员青年团，当天就开始，儿童也去干。手捉又持剪，一天二十亩，到晚同捉完。人人都说好，禾苗长的欢。老农同下地，都去把虫剪，不到一星期，人人同向前。这件好工作，干部带头干，保证禾苗好，秋收囤丰满，谁要不下地，秋天后悔晚。不论老和少，赶快下地田，虫子都捉尽，今年是丰年”。
    秋后收成一如常年，老贾在群众中的威信更高了起来。
    去年雨季植树时，群众接受不了，说：“离了皮栽不活”。老贾就先动员支部党员连家里的人都亲自下手种植，来影响别人。他老婆带着病孩子也到地里种植了，老乡们非常感动地说：“人家老贾家抱着病孩子还去栽树，咱们为什么不去呢？”第二天全村多数群众连男带女也都栽起来了。就这样，全村四三二户，二、○六八人的太平庄，在去年雨季就栽了十六万多株，成活率都也很好——百分之六七十以上。
    在任何一件工作上，贾化龙总是以身作则，深入群众，引导启发作好工作。当他村一个懒汉，早晨睡懒觉不起时，他就决心去改造他，但并不是干涉强制，而是在门口以关心的态度唤叫：“老弟，你不舒服了吗？早先看看吧？别把身子耽误了。”他就是这样的来鼓励懒汉们注意生产，结果很有效。冬季生产时，群众为不误生产提出要设一个钟以便统一大家起床时间，可是找遍全村连一小段钢轨也寻不见。这时老贾就自报奋勇，承担下每天早上在庙疙瘩上“登高一喊”的责任。他毫无间隔的一直坚持了四十多天。一天早上，老贾因精神太坏去喊叫大家起床时，曾昏倒在地上。起早的农民听不见老贾的喊叫，就到庙疙瘩上去看，结果看见老贾在地上躺着，就赶紧喊了许多人将老贾抬回家去。群众时时不断的去看他安慰他，要他好好的休养，对他像亲人似的看待。可是很快老贾就又同他们一块生产了。
    贾化龙同志与党员群众关系搞的好，但却不是一团和气，而是严肃认真坚持原则，循循善诱。在领导上他有一点成功的经验就是：有成绩就奖励。去冬组织打猎，程海荣五天打了两只狐狸，他就在黑板报上编歌鼓励：
    “老乡注意听，咱村有个程海荣，他今年正六旬，作工赛过青年人，搞生产更抓紧，他要争取老英雄。夜迟眠，起五更，每天打猎野地寻，打狐狼害畜生，五天二狐打家中，买了米家渡用，他的生活高一层。望老乡与老农，大家同向这样行，会甚作甚勿放松。各街组男女们，看看老汉多光荣。”
    贾化龙是一个很好的党的宣传员，每遇一件重要事情时，他就同党员或群众一起作诗作歌，登载在黑板报上，用以劝导鼓励群众或是对敌特的谣言作斗争。去年秋天，为了推动秋收，他们就编出了一个秋收歌：
    “老农民注意听，五谷成熟高粱红，快修场农具整，预备秋收好使用。绿豆收就快耕，明年春天少费工，收大田更费工，大男小女同劳动。各干部唤农民，每天广播起五更，早收割早完成，免的咱们把心惊。劝懒汉劝懒婆，应当劳动到田中。千万言说不尽，对于秋收莫放松。”
    以后根据工作需要，又编出了发展副业歌，改造懒汉懒婆歌等，对于推动工作鼓舞群众情绪起了很大作用。
    由于贾化龙同志领导得好，太平庄支部的工作样样走在前头。去年在县党代表会上支部被评为一等模范，贾化龙也被评为优等支书。
