　　The Capital's Judicial Organs
    Connect Work and Study the Marriage Law
    [Our Newspaper] Since the promulgation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, cadres of the Central People's Government and the Beijing judicial organs have been studying it in conjunction with their actual work to correctly grasp the spirit of the Marriage Law and implement the marriage policy.

    Cadres at all levels of the Supreme People's Court have achieved preliminary results in studying the Marriage Law. Their study is uniformly arranged by the All-Court Cadre Study Committee, and a total of more than 260 people are organized. The study time is one week. The specific leadership of the study is controlled by each group. The content of the study is mainly the Marriage Law, with reference to the report on the Marriage Law by Comrade Chen Shaoyu, Director of the Legislative Affairs Commission, and other learning materials related to the Marriage Law. In the study, special attention is paid to the marriage cases that have been processed in the past. Many problems and opinions have been raised in the study and discussion of each group. In the past, some comrades did not understand the basic spirit of the Marriage Law, but after this study, they have clearly realized the significance and role of the Marriage Law. Some comrades used to look at the articles in isolation, but now they can look at the Marriage Law comprehensively.

    Cadres of the Legislative Affairs Commission of the Central People's Government began preliminary study after the draft of the Marriage Law was drawn up. Cadres at all levels of the Ministry of Justice and the Beijing People's Court have also started learning separately. Some of them have conducted group discussions; some have listened to several reports on the Marriage Law, and then studied it by themselves in conjunction with specific articles. The Fourth and Fifth Divisions of the Ministry of Justice and the Judicial Cadre Training Class have been studying for two weeks.

　　首都各司法机关
    联系工作学习婚姻法
    【本报讯】自中华人民共和国婚姻法公布以来，中央人民政府及北京市各司法机关干部为正确掌握婚姻法的精神，贯彻婚姻政策，已分别结合着实际工作展开学习。
    中央最高人民法院各级干部学习婚姻法已获得初步成绩。他们的学习，是由全院干部学习委员会统一布置的，共组织了二百六十余人。学习时间为一个星期。学习具体领导是由各组分别掌握。学习内容以婚姻法为主，并参考法制委员会陈绍禹主任委员的关于婚姻法的报告和其他有关婚姻法的学习资料。在学习中特别注重联系过去已处理过的婚姻案件。各组在学习讨论中，都提出了许多问题和意见。过去有些同志对婚姻法的基本精神了解不够，这次学习后，已清楚地认识了婚姻法的意义和作用。有的同志过去只是孤立地看条文，现在开始能全面地去看婚姻法了。
    中央人民政府法制委员会干部从婚姻法草案拟出后，即开始了初步学习。司法部以及北京市人民法院等单位各级干部也均分别展开了学习。他们有的曾进行分组讨论；有的听了几次有关婚姻法的报告后，即结合着具体条文进行自学。司法部第四、五两司和司法干部轮训班学习已进行了两个星期。
