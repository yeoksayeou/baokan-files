Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 15th: Various localities in the Central-South region are carrying out spring epidemic prevention work, effectively curbing the spread of various epidemics. Since the beginning of spring this year, some areas of Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces have successively experienced outbreaks of infectious diseases such as measles, malignant malaria, plague, and smallpox. The provincial people's governments, in coordination with the health departments of the provincial military regions, medical schools, and local public and private hospitals, as well as associations of doctors of both Chinese and Western medicine, jointly organized epidemic prevention institutions at all levels to carry out epidemic prevention work. The Health Department of the Central-South Military and Political Committee and various provinces and cities also formed mobile epidemic prevention teams, which went to the epidemic areas to carry out prevention and treatment. For example, after the plague was discovered in the Leizhou Peninsula of Guangdong, the provincial health institute, the health department of the Guangdong Military Region, and the Northeast epidemic prevention team formed a joint brigade, went deep into the countryside, and quickly extinguished the plague. Major cities and many counties and districts have universally carried out the work of injecting various epidemic disease vaccines and vaccinating with cowpox. According to incomplete statistics, the number of people vaccinated with cowpox in Wuhan reached 384,350; in Nanchang, Jiangxi, 129,766 people were injected with plague vaccine in March and April; and in Hunan, according to incomplete statistics from 35 counties and cities in April, a total of 376,716 people were vaccinated with cowpox. Many cities have also launched garbage removal and rat-catching campaigns. In March, the Wuchang urban area transported a total of 624 tons of garbage, greatly reducing the opportunity for germs to breed and exist. In Nanchang, during the rat-catching campaign, 19,874 rats were caught in 18 days. At the same time, epidemic prevention institutions in various provinces and cities also mobilized teachers and students of local primary and secondary schools to conduct extensive publicity and education work. In addition, epidemic prevention institutions in various places used health exhibitions, films, newspapers, slogans, and oral propaganda to explain the importance of epidemic prevention and general epidemic prevention knowledge, breaking the superstitious ideas about epidemics among the people, so that they automatically paid attention to environmental sanitation and were willing to accept injections and vaccinations.

　　大力开展春季防疫工作  中南区遏止疫病流行
    【新华社汉口十五日电】中南区各地展开春季防疫工作，有效地遏止了各种疫病的流行。今年入春以来，河南、湖北、湖南、江西、广东等五省部分地区，先后发现有麻疹、恶性疟疾、鼠疫、天花等传染病的流行。各省人民政府配合各省军区卫生部、医科学校和当地公私立医院及中西医师公会联合组织了各级防疫机构，开展防疫工作。中南军政委员会卫生部及各省市并组成了流动防疫队，分赴疫区，进行防治。如广东雷州半岛发现鼠疫后，即由省人民政府卫生所、广东军区卫生部及东北防疫队组成联合大队，深入乡村，迅速扑灭鼠疫。各大城市及许多县区都普遍进行注射各种疫病预防针和接种牛痘苗的工作。据不完全统计，武汉市经接种牛痘苗者即达三十八万四千三百五十人；江西南昌市在三、四月间注射鼠疫苗者达十二万九千七百六十六人；湖南在四月份据三十五个县市不完全统计，共接种痘苗三十七万六千七百一十六人。不少城市并展开了清除垃圾和捕鼠运动。武昌市区在三月间即共运出垃圾六百二十四吨，大大减除了病菌繁殖和存在的机会。南昌市在开展捕鼠运动中，十八天内捕鼠一万九千八百七十四头。同时各省市防疫机构并动员了当地中小学校师生，进行广泛的宣传教育工作。此外，各地防疫机构并通过卫生展览会、影片、报刊、标语及口头宣传等方式，讲解防疫的重要性和一般的防疫常识，打破了人民群众中对疫病的迷信思想，使他们自动注意环境卫生和愿意接受注射接种。
