　　Implementing a Labor-Capital Mutual Benefit Policy
    Beibei Daming Textile and Dyeing Factory's Output Exceeds All Previous Levels
    [This News Report] Chongqing Xinhua Daily News: Workers at the privately owned Daming Textile and Dyeing Factory in Beibei are actively engaged in production, and output has rapidly increased, now exceeding previous production levels. This is the result of implementing the "labor-capital mutual benefit" policy. Under the leadership of the trade union and the Youth League work group, the factory's employees underwent more than three months of study, clarifying their understanding of restoring and developing production. The workers, acting as masters of the factory, made positive suggestions to the factory regarding production and management issues. The capitalist, based on the workers' opinions, held democratic discussions with the trade union preparatory committee, adopted the workers' reasonable suggestions, and made partial reforms to unreasonable systems. For example, they added skilled female weavers, completely abolished the body search system, issued masks in the spinning department, and issued wooden shoes in the weaving department (because the fabric area is damp, workers often suffer from foot rot in the summer). Recently, more attention has been paid to the workers' lives, such as expanding the kitchen and allowing the workers to manage the food themselves; workers on the C shift who worked four hours of the night shift without eating and were unable to bear the hunger are now given supplementary steamed buns; Daming Elementary School added a kindergarten class, providing a place for employees' children. As a result, workers have demonstrated a high degree of production enthusiasm. Since mid-March, after female worker Diao Xiangzhi from the textile department took the lead in setting a new record, female worker Su Daxi from the weaving B shift then set a new record of weaving 45 yards of plain cloth in ten hours (according to the Daming factory's looms, which rotate 173 times per minute, it is possible to weave 48 yards of cloth in ten hours with no obstacles). Female worker Yang Chengbi of the reeling department, who originally set a new record with 42 spindles, jumped to 51 spindles in ten hours of work on the evening of March 31. Female worker Huang Nailian in the roving department created 10.68 hanks in ten hours, the highest record in history. In addition to individuals, the production performance of departments as units was excellent. The entire white shift of the fine spinning department of the spinning department produced 2464 pounds of yarn in ten hours, exceeding the previous highest record of 2200 pounds by 464 pounds; the finishing department of the dyeing department completed 510 bolts of blue cloth in eight hours, exceeding the past 350 bolts by 160 bolts. The production volume of the entire factory is increasing unprecedentedly with the workers' enthusiastic production upsurge. In the second half of March, the factory's yarn production surged to 194 pieces, and the cloth production was 4351 bolts. According to this standard, more than 380 pieces of yarn and more than 8600 bolts of cloth can be produced monthly; before liberation, the highest monthly output was 7320 bolts of cloth and 348 pieces of yarn; the current output has exceeded any monthly record in the factory's history.
    The workers also pay attention to saving raw materials, enabling the factory's "manufacturing cost (including wages)" for each piece of cotton yarn and each bolt of white cloth to be reduced by 12 percent. The total cost of one piece of yarn can be reduced by about 5 percent, and the total cost of one bolt of white cloth can also be reduced by 3.5 percent. In terms of labor, before liberation, an average of 36 workdays were required per piece of yarn throughout the year; according to the current production situation, only 30 workdays are needed; before liberation, weaving one bolt of cloth required an average of two workdays, now only one and a half is enough. In order to commend and encourage active producers, at the production model award ceremony held on April 2, seventeen workers who created new records received material prizes from the factory. Zhu Jixun, the factory director, told the workers at the meeting that as long as the workers work hard, the factory will definitely use the money earned to expand production.

　　实行劳资两利政策
    北碚大明纺织染厂产量突破历年水平
    【本报讯】重庆新华日报消息：北碚私营大明纺织染厂工人积极生产，产量迅速提高，现已突破历年生产水平。这是由于执行了“劳资两利”政策的结果。该厂职工在工会、青委工作组的领导下，经过三个多月的学习后，工人们对于恢复与发展生产的认识明确了。工人们以主人翁的身份对厂方有关生产与工厂管理问题提出积极的建议，资方根据工人的意见与工会筹委会进行民主讨论，采纳了工人的合理建议，对不合理的制度作了局部改革，如增添了织布熟手女工，彻底废除了搜腰制，纺部发了口罩，织部发了木鞋（因布间潮湿，夏天工人时常烂脚）等。最近对工人的生活比较关心，如扩大厨房，伙食公开给工人自己办；丙班工友做夜班四个钟头不吃饭饿的受不了，现在补发馒头；大明子弟小学增设幼稚班，使职工幼儿有所寄托。因此工人发挥了高度生产积极性。从三月中旬，由纺织部女工刁祥芝带头创造新纪录以后，接着织布乙班女工苏大秀在十小时内又创织平板布四十五码的新纪录（按大明厂的织布机每分钟转一七三次，在十小时工作中保证绝无任何障碍可织布四十八码）。摇纱部的女工杨成碧，她原来以四十二车创造新纪录，到三月三十一日晚十小时工作内跃入五十一车。粗纱间女工黄乃莲在十小时内创造一○·六八亨司，为历年来最高纪录。除了个人外，以部门为单位生产成绩优良的，有纺部细纱间白班全班在十小时内产纱二四六四磅，比历年最高纪录二二○○磅超过四六四磅；染部成品间在八小时内完成蓝布成品五一○匹，比过去三五○匹超过一六○匹。整个厂里的生产量是随着工人们积极生产的热潮空前提高，三月份下半月全厂纱的产量激增到一九四件，布的产量四三五一匹，根据这个标准每月可产纱三八○余件，产布八六○○余匹；解放以前最高月份的产量，布为七三二○匹，纱三四八件；现在的产量已超过该厂历年来任何一个月的纪录。
    工人们并注意节约原料，使该厂每一件棉纱和每一匹白布的“制造费用成本（包括工资在内）”，可以减少百分之十二，一件纱的总成本，约可减低百分之五左右，一匹白布的总成本也可减低百分之三·五。从人工来说，解放前全年平均每件纱需要人工三十六工，照目前的生产情况，只要三十个人工；织一匹布在解放前平均要两个人工，现在只要一个半就够了。为了表扬鼓励积极生产者，该厂在四月二日的生产模范给奖大会上，有十七个创造新纪录的工人得到厂方实物的奖品。该厂厂长朱己训在大会上向工人们表示只要工人努力生产，厂方一定把赚的钱拿来扩大生产。
