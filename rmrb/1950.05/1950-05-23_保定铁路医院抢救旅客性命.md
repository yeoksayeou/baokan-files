    Baoding Railway Hospital Rescues Passenger's Life
    At 3 p.m. on May 14th, Jiang Zhongwen, the duty doctor at Baoding Railway Hospital, received a call from Xushui Station reporting that a farmer passenger, Hu He'er, had jumped off a train and broken his leg. They were preparing to send him to the hospital for treatment, estimating that the train would arrive in Baoding at 4 p.m.
    Comrade Jiang Zhongwen immediately sent someone to find Doctor Li Zhongtian and assisted Doctor Li in disinfecting the surgical instruments. At approximately 4 p.m., workers Zhang Wencheng and Song Shuchun carried the injured man to the hospital on a stretcher. The patient's left lower leg bone was broken, and he was bleeding heavily (estimated to be over 1000 cc), and his pulse was almost nonexistent. The doctor first gave him a cardiotonic and Ringer's solution. After careful study by the doctors, they determined that surgery could not be performed immediately and a blood transfusion was necessary. Comrade Jiang Zhongwen immediately initiated a blood donation drive. Many doctors and nurses signed up. Two doctors transfused a total of 165 cc of fresh blood from themselves and student nurses Yuan Yuzhen and Gao Xiulan into Hu He'er's vein, and his condition gradually improved. Doctor Liu Zhaohua, who had returned from Beijing, immediately began the surgery. Jiang Zhongwen and Song Ruipu, who were off duty, and Li Zhongtian, Lu Yaozong, Gao Xiulan, Yuan Yuzhen, Li Deliang, and Wang Rui from the pharmacy, all volunteered to help. The patient's condition has been good for the past two days. The Baoding Railway Hospital's doctors and all staff's highly responsible spirit of serving the sick and wounded saved the life of farmer Hu He'er.

　　保定铁路医院抢救旅客性命
    五月十四日下午三时，保定铁路医院值日医师蒋仲文接到徐水站的电话，报告一位农民旅客扈合尔跳车跌断了腿骨，准备把他送到医院医治，估计下午四点车可到保定。
    蒋仲文同志立即派人去将医师李中田同志找来，并协助李医师将手术器械消毒。下午四时许，由工友张文成、宋树春二人用担架将受伤者抬到医院来。病人的左下腿骨头折断了，出血很多（估计一○○○西西以上），脉搏几乎停止了。医师先给他打了强心剂，和林格儿液（Rjnger.S）。经医师们详细研究，不能立即动手术，非先输血不可。蒋仲文同志立即发起输血报名运动。许多医师和护士都报了名。两位医师将自己的和学习护士袁玉贞、高秀兰的鲜血共一六五西西输入了扈合尔的静脉管内，情况逐渐好转。从北京回来的医师刘兆华，马上开始了手术。已经下班的蒋仲文、宋瑞璞，和不值班的李中田、卢耀宗、高秀兰、袁玉贞，药房的李德良、王锐等，都主动帮忙。两日来病人情况良好。保定铁路医院的医师及全体工作人员为伤病员服务的高度负责精神，救活了农民扈合尔的性命。
