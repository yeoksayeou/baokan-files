Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, May 23rd: Supply and marketing cooperatives in various parts of Zhejiang Province have achieved great success in purchasing and selling local native products and organizing mass production. Since the beginning of spring, supply and marketing cooperatives throughout Zhejiang Province have purchased and sold a total of 10.844 billion yuan worth of native products such as bamboo, wood, charcoal, and native paper, opening up sales channels for native products that account for 30 percent of the province's total agricultural output value. At the same time, local supply and marketing cooperatives have sold 8.975 billion yuan worth of grain, seeds, farm implements, and fertilizers to farmers in mountainous areas such as Xiaoshan, Siming Mountain, and Tianmu Mountain, gradually alleviating the spring famine and enabling timely spring planting.

In coordinating with state-owned specialized companies to purchase native products and sell daily necessities, cooperatives in various regions generally conduct transactions directly with farmers, avoiding or greatly reducing intermediate exploitation. For example, the Xiaoshan County Cooperative abolished the local market's "small renter" (a system of exploitation even more severe than "brokers") system in the purchase of tobacco leaves, raising the reasonable price of each load of tobacco from five dou of rice to eight dou of rice.

In organizing mass production, local cooperatives first reformed native products with limited development prospects based on existing conditions, guiding them towards proper production directions. For example, the Fuyang County Cooperative successfully transformed the native paper industry, which originally produced superstitious paper, into producing cultural paper and sanitary paper. Now, it is further experimenting with the production of economic newspapers, thus transforming the native paper industry, which accounts for 40 percent of the county's total income, from decline to new life.

Secondly, based on local material conditions and the needs of farmers in production and life, production, transportation, and consumer cooperatives were organized separately. In Jiangshan, Changshan, Qu County, and other areas in the western Zhejiang mountainous area, limestone production, transportation, and marketing cooperatives were organized, providing employment for unemployed kiln workers. The Wenzhou Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative organized 500 private boats in the Oujiang River basin to form a transportation cooperative and signed long-term consignment contracts with state-owned trading companies. This not only prevented more than 1,500 boatmen from becoming unemployed but also enabled the mutual adjustment of production materials and daily necessities such as alum, brown sugar, salt, and grain in the Oujiang River basin. The Hangzhou Cooperative Federation purchased native hemp that was unusable in the textile industry and organized women to weave hemp bags. Cooperatives in Ningbo, Wenzhou, Taizhou, and other places organized women to weave straw mats, straw hats, and make straw sandals, all achieving great success.

Because cooperatives actively helped farmers solve production difficulties, they gained the support of the broad masses, and the organization of cooperatives also developed. Currently, among the nine special districts and seventy-four counties in the province, seventy counties have established supply and marketing cooperative federations. Under the cooperative federation, eight county branches and thirty-four supply and marketing stations have been established. Mass cooperatives have also been organized in 372 locations, with 187,400 members and 1.736 billion yuan in share capital.

　　浙江各地供销合作社
    购销土产组织生产  帮助农民春耕渡荒
    【新华社杭州二十三日电】浙江省各地供销合作社在收购和推销当地土产品及组织群众生产上，获得很大成绩。入春以来，浙省各地供销合作社共收购和推销了竹、木、炭、土纸等土产总额达一百零八亿四千四百余万元，给占全省农民生产总值百分之三十的土产品打开了销路。同时，各地供销社又以价值八十九亿七千五百余万元的粮食、种籽、农具和肥料等推销给萧山、四明山、天目山等山区的农民，使春荒得以逐步缓和，春耕播种得以及时进行。
    各地合作社在配合国营各专业公司代购土产品和代销生活必需品时，一般均作到了与农民直接进行交易，避免或大大减轻了中间剥削。如萧山县合作社在收购烟叶中，废除了当地市场陋规的“小租人”（剥削程度较“掮客”尤重）制度，使每担烟价由五斗米提到八斗米的合理价格。
    各地合作社在组织群众生产时，首先是根据客观条件，将发展前途不大的土产在现有基础上进行了改造，使其走向正当的生产方向。如富阳县合作社即将原先造迷信纸的土纸业改制文化用纸和卫生用纸，获得成功后，现正进一步试制经济报纸，因而使占该县人民生产总收入百分之四十的土纸工业由没落转入新生。
    其次是根据各地物质条件和农民在生产及生活上的要求，分别组织了生产、运输以及消费等合作社。浙西山区一带的江山、常山、衢县等地均组织了石灰生产运销合作社，使失业窑工获得职业。温州专区供销社组织瓯江流域五百只民船成立了运输合作社，并与国营贸易公司订立长期托运合同，因而不仅使一千五百余船工免于失业，且使瓯江流域的明矾、红糖、盐、粮等生产资料与生活资料得到了相互调剂。杭州合作总社收购了纺织工业上不能用的土麻，组织妇女织麻袋。宁波、温州、台州等地合作社组织妇女编草席、草帽，打草鞋，都获得很大成绩。
    由于合作社积极帮助农民解决生产困难，获得广大群众的拥护，合作社的组织也获得了发展。现全省九个专区七十四个县中已有七十个县先后建立了供销合作总社，在合作总社下又成立八个县分社，三十四个供销站等。群众性的合作社亦已组织了三百七十二处，社员达十八万七千四百余人，股金十七亿三千六百余万元。
