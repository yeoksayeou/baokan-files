　　Cadre Performance Appraisal Work Over the Past Three Months
　　Su Jie
　　When summarizing the work of 1949, the First District Public Office of Beijing Municipality appraised the work and thinking of cadres, thereby improving the policy and ideological levels of cadres. On this basis, it further proposed the establishment of a system for "investigating the work performance of staff."

　　　　The Process of Ideological Mobilization
　　When the administrative leadership initially proposed the performance appraisal system in early January, the Party and Youth League branches immediately began their guarantee work. The Youth League branches even mobilized each member to create a personal three-month progress plan. Some Youth League members proposed in their plans to overcome major ideological shortcomings, improve their professional abilities, and complete their work plans within three months or half a year, striving to join the Chinese Communist Party through practical actions. At that time, in addition to repeated ideological mobilization, the leadership also widely conducted deliberation through Party and Youth League activists. The Party and Youth League branches proposed that future absorption and appraisal of Party and Youth League members would be based on the results of regular performance appraisals. The administrative meetings proposed that this would be used as a basis for promoting cadres and determining salaries (for cadres on a salary system). This quickly reversed the attitude of some cadres who thought "performance appraisal is nothing" and created a new atmosphere of mutual competition for progress.

　　　　Several Problems That Must Be Solved
　　1. Clarify cadre responsibilities and meticulously divide labor. In the past, due to the recent establishment of institutions and chaotic use of cadres by the leadership, some cadres' work was not fixed, making it difficult to delve into professional work. When performance appraisal work was proposed, requiring everyone to develop a work plan, many people did not know where to start; some people thought that it was enough for each section to have a plan, and it was not necessary to make personal plans. The leadership, on the one hand, clearly stipulated the responsibilities of each person, and on the other hand, enlightened cadres to recognize the importance of making plans. It was proposed that making, meeting and exceeding work plans on time was the primary condition for performance evaluation in January. This is the foundation of the performance evaluation work; it is an important step in consolidating the performance evaluation work from the system. Over the past three months, everyone has deeply realized the importance of making plans. A cadre engaged in industrial and commercial work said: "In the past, I always considered the things to be done for the day in the morning, grasping a little here and a little there, without any clue. Now I feel that my work is very organized and I am much more proactive." Some people also said: "In the past, I always waited for the section chief to give me things to do, but now I don't have to."
　　2. Performance appraisal work is a mass competition movement of new heroism. To smoothly develop and implement this work, there must be a strong leadership organization. The district formed a performance evaluation committee consisting of five members, with the district head as an ex officio member (and chairman). The administrative meeting and the Party and Youth League branches each nominated one person to participate, and then all cadres elected a mass activist to participate. All issues of performance evaluation work are handled through the committee.
　　3. The performance evaluation committee should propose performance evaluation conditions suitable for the general situation, based on the level of cadre progress in each period. The initial conditions should not be too high, and should enable general cadres to reach the standard through not-too-difficult efforts. Otherwise, it will form the activity of a few people. There should be more grades. The district initially stipulated five grades: namely, making progress, making significant progress, minor merit, major merit (three minor merits equal one major merit), and model. During the March summary, the objective situation broke through these five grades again. Although some comrades did not make comprehensive progress, they made achievements in a certain job. Therefore, two more items were added: "making achievements" and "making significant achievements."
　　4. There should be multi-faceted evaluation. The steps of the evaluation are: first, select within the group, then exchange opinions between the sections, then conduct mutual evaluation between the groups, general evaluation at the general cadre meeting, and finally review and approval by the performance evaluation committee. This avoids the bias of unfair evaluation.
　　5. According to the development of cadres' thinking, timely proposing slogans and tasks for each period is a powerful way to promote this work. In January, based on the problems existing in the general cadres in 1949, the leadership proposed to oppose procrastination and fatigue, improve work efficiency, promote the spirit of delving into professional work, work should be planned and summarized; strive to change the work from passive to active in one or two months. In March, it was proposed to go deep into the grassroots, connect with reality, and oppose bureaucratic and red tape style. Because the direction is clear and the work is step-by-step, it can be seen from the monthly performance evaluation summary that most cadres have made a lot of improvements.

　　　　Harvest
　　Over the past three months, the results of the performance evaluation work have been very obvious. In the past, the work in the district was in a passive and chaotic state. Cadres sat in the office dealing with temporary affairs. The cases in the mediation section were accumulated for a long time and had not been well sorted out and studied. The Culture and Education Section did not understand the cultural and educational situation in the district and lacked a clear work policy. The Civil Affairs Section was struggling to cope with the problem of providing relief to military dependents, but did not pay attention to leading the production of military dependents. Ideologically, many cadres were ambitious and unwilling to do arduous work. Many people had the problem of employment views and individual heroism, which once affected the work.
　　After three months of performance evaluation work, the above problems have been basically solved. The work has changed from passive to active, reducing the phenomenon of chaos. The cadres of each section have gone out of the office. The three cadres in the Civil Affairs Section who lead production have gone deep into the factory and worked and lived with the workers, from which they understood and solved many problems. Some retained cadres have also become active. During the March summary, two people were rated as making progress. The atmosphere of cadres studying policies and professional work is stronger than before. The phenomenon of odd job workers fighting is gone. The dispatcher, who is the most difficult to accept criticism, is now also actively seeking the opinions of others.

　　三个月来的干部考绩工作
　　苏捷
    北京市第一区区公所在总结一九四九年的工作时，曾对干部的工作及思想作了鉴定，提高了干部的政策及思想水平。在此基础上，进一步提出了建立“考查工作人员工作成绩”的制度。
            思想动员的经过
    当一月初行政领导上开始提出考绩制度时，在党和团的支部立即开始了保证工作。团的支部并动员每个团员制出个人的三个月进步计划。有些团员的计划书上，提出三个月或半年内克服思想上的主要缺点，提高业务能力，完成工作计划；以实际行动，争取加入中国共产党。当时领导上除反复进行思想动员外，更通过党团积极分子，普遍进行酝酿。党团支部提出今后将以经常的考绩的结果，作为吸收和鉴定党团员的根据。行政会议上则提出今后将以此作为提拔干部、评定薪金（对薪金制干部）的依据。这样很快地扭转了部分干部认为“考绩没有什么”的情绪，造成了互相竞赛进步的新气象。
            必须解决的几个问题
    一、明确干部职责，细致分工。过去由于机构成立不久，领导上使用干部时又有混乱现象，因此，若干干部工作不固定，很难钻研业务。当提出考绩工作，要求每人制订工作计划时，很多人都不知道从何处下手；有人认为各科有计划就行了，不必再订个人计划。领导上一方面明确规定了每个人的职责，同时启发干部认识订计划的重要性。提出按时制订并超过、完成工作计划，是一月份评绩的首要条件。这是评绩工作的基础；是从制度上将考绩工作巩固下来的重要步骤。三个月来，大家都深刻体会到订计划的重要性。一个作工商工作的干部说：“过去总是每天早晨才考虑一天要做的事情，东抓一把，西抓一把，茫无头绪。现在觉得自己的工作很有条理，也主动多了。”也有人说：“过去总是等着科长给事做，现在不用了。”
    二、考绩工作是新英雄主义的群众竞赛运动。要想顺利开展并贯彻这个工作，必须有一个坚强的领导组织。该区组成了包括五个委员的评绩委员会，区长是当然委员（兼主任委员）。行政会议与党团支部各推选一人参加，再由全体干部推选一名群众积极分子参加。考绩工作的一切问题，都通过委员会去做。
    三、评绩委员会应根据各个时期的干部进步水平，提出适合一般情况的评绩条件。最初条件不宜过高，应使一般干部经过不太困难的努力，就能达到标准。否则会形成少数人的活动。等级应当多些。该区最初规定了五种等级：即有进步，有显著进步，小功，大功（三小功为一大功），模范。三月小结的时候，客观情况又冲破了这五个等级。有些同志虽没有全面的进步，但在某一件工作上却作出了成绩。于是又增加了“有成绩”，和“有显著成绩”两项。
    四、应该多方面评议。评议的步骤是：首先在小组内评选，然后在各科之间交换意见，再进行小组间的互评，全体干部大会的总评，最后由评绩委员会审查批准。这就避免了评议不公允的偏向。
    五、根据干部思想发展情况，适时地提出各个时期的口号和任务，是推动这一工作的有力办法。一月份，领导上根据一九四九年一般干部存在的问题，提出反对拖拉、疲蹋现象，提高工作效率，发扬钻研业务的精神，工作要有计划，有总结；争取在一两个月内把工作由被动转为主动。三月份则提出深入下层，联系实际，反对官僚主义及文牍主义作风。因为方向明确，工作有步骤，从每月评绩总结中，可以看出多数干部都有了不少改进。
            收获
    三个月来，考绩工作的成绩是很显明的。在过去，该区的工作处于被动、忙乱状态。干部坐在办公室里，应付临时的事务工作。调解科的案件长期积累，没有很好清理研究过。文教科不了解本区的文教情况，缺乏明确的工作方针。民政科苦于应付军属救济的问题。但是没有注意领导军属生产。在干部思想上，许多人好高鹜远，不愿做艰苦工作。许多人存在着雇佣观点，个人英雄主义的毛病，曾经影响了工作。
    经过三个月的考绩工作，上述问题基本上已获得解决。工作由被动转为主动，减少了忙乱现象。各科的干部都已走出了办公室。民政科三个领导生产的干部，深入工厂，和工人一起工作、生活，从中了解并解决了许多问题。若干留用干部也积极起来了。三月小结时，有两人被评为有进步。干部研究政策、业务的空气较前浓厚。勤杂人员打架的现象已没有了。最难接受批评的收发员，现在也主动征求别人的意见。
