　　Pay More Attention to Economic Issues

Editor's Note: As our country gradually shifts to focusing on production and construction, this newspaper publishes this editorial from the Truth Newspaper, "Pay More Attention to Economic Issues," to attract the attention of newspapers and periodicals across the country.

Our Soviet socialist economy has eliminated the anarchy of production, crises, the fear of unemployment, the poverty of the masses, and other sores and shortcomings of capitalism. In the post-war period, our socialist economy has repeatedly demonstrated its great superiority over capitalist economies.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people have achieved remarkable success in the struggle to complete and exceed the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan. In the major sectors of the national economy, we have not only reached pre-war production levels, but have also exceeded them.

Our Bolshevik press—the collective propagandist, agitator, and organizer of the masses—should play a significant role in the struggle to further develop the national economy, strive for higher rates of economic growth, and strive for a new upsurge in socialist competition. At the current stage of development of our national economy, the press is presented with new, complex, and multifaceted problems. These problems need to be explained profoundly and comprehensively.

As early as 1918, Lenin, in his article "On Our Newspapers," called on Soviet newspapers to study economic issues more, but this economics did not refer to "general" inferences. Lenin wrote: "...The economics we want refers to the collection, meticulous examination, and research of various facts about the real construction of a new life... We still rarely use vivid and concrete examples and models from all aspects of life to educate the masses. And this is the main task of the newspaper in the transition period from capitalism to socialism." Comrade Stalin has also repeatedly emphasized that our newspapers should play an important role in the cause of socialist construction. In his article "Competition and the Surge of Mass Labor," Comrade Stalin gave our press this task: to profoundly expound on the issue of competition, which is the personal cause of millions of working masses.

Our press, implementing the instructions of Lenin and Stalin, has done a great deal of work in explaining economic construction and socialist competition, both in the past and now. Our press has played an important role in launching nationwide socialist competition and the Stakhanovite movement, in promoting the advanced labor methods of production innovators, and in criticizing the shortcomings of our economic construction. Even now, in the struggle to complete the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, the press remains a powerful weapon in the hands of our Party—the inspirer and organizer of all the victories of the Soviet people. Advanced newspapers actively support everything new and advanced, and wage a constant struggle against the backward and decadent.

However, there are serious shortcomings in our press's explanation of economic issues. Some newspapers have become detached from the most practical and urgent issues in the development of the Soviet economy. For example, the Kemerovo Oblast newspaper "Kuzbass," which is the newspaper of the largest coal and metallurgy center in the country. But for a long time, it has not explained these important issues in the coal industry: such as the mechanization of coal mining, the application of new technologies, the organization of labor in mines, and the issue of improving productivity. In the newspaper's fragmentary and superficial reports on economic issues, the newspaper's editorial department often shows its own lack of knowledge.

Or let's take the "Gorkov Commune" newspaper as an example—this is the newspaper of the largest machine-building center. This newspaper lacks purposefulness in explaining economic issues and cannot report continuously from beginning to end—this is the style of the Oblast newspaper in explaining economic issues.

Some newspapers do not study agricultural issues in depth. Important issues such as the construction of collective farms and the organization of collective farm labor and production are only described superficially. For example, the Uzbek Republic newspaper "Truth of the East" has not engaged in a persistent struggle to strictly abide by the regulations of agricultural labor combinations and to mechanize the main part of agricultural production in the republic—cotton. "Kazakhstan Truth" has also not done enough to explain the development of public animal husbandry.

In order to be able to explain Soviet economic issues, the staff of the press should first master the basic knowledge of economics themselves, should study economic issues more deeply, and should often go to production departments, should be familiar with the advanced people in production and should often communicate with them, and should absorb active authors who know economic issues to participate in the newspaper.

Stakhanovite workers are innovators in our industry. Therefore, it is of great significance for newspaper platforms to invite production innovators—Stakhanovite workers, and scientific and technological activists—scholars and intellectuals who are engineers and technicians—to speak, in promoting advanced experience.

Lenin expressed this hope more than thirty years ago: "As far as possible, make a large number of people who work among the masses and with the masses, who work in the current vibrant life, write about their own experiences."

Lenin's instructions still have full practical significance today. Unfortunately, some of our newspapers still often publish empty and contentless articles written by authors who have a superficial understanding of economics.

When launching socialist competition, newspapers should fight for the widespread adoption of new technologies and for the mechanization and technological advancement of production processes.

The responsibility of the newspaper is to disseminate the socialist competition of the masses in order to strive to complete the production plan ahead of schedule and improve product quality, and to strive to make all enterprises work regularly, so that each workshop and work team can complete or overfulfill the production plan on a daily and monthly basis—this plan must include not only the total output of products, but also the types of products that have been formulated. It is necessary to constantly support and develop the creativity of the masses. This creativity can be manifested in striving for savings and unplanned accumulation, striving to accelerate the turnover of working capital, striving to rationally use production sites, making better use of equipment and all major means of production, and striving to save raw materials and materials.

The creative suggestions of the masses are increasing, the ranks of innovators are increasing, and new patriotic initiatives of laborers are emerging day by day. Recently, the new initiative of Li Jiya Kolabelnikova, a female member of the Communist Youth League, has gained widespread dissemination. She and her team set the task of overfulfilling the plan every day and working one day each month with materials saved. The initiative of first-class technician Fedor Kuznetsov has also been widely responded to. He has ensured in his work section that he will save raw materials and materials well by reducing material scraps.

If the newspaper pays timely attention to fresh things, supports and promotes the experience of innovators, and strives to make it widely adopted in production, then the merits of the newspaper are great.

When publicizing the experience of advanced people and innovators in production, our press should also boldly launch Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism of the shortcomings in the field of economic construction. Special attention should be paid to the work of backward industrial sectors, backward enterprises, collective farms, machine tractor stations, and state-owned farms. We should deeply explore the reasons for the backwardness of a certain enterprise or region, criticize the specific persons responsible for the shortcomings, and resolutely strive to achieve new achievements in all sectors of communist construction.

Pay more attention to economic issues! Make every newspaper profoundly and systematically explain the most important issues of socialist economics. Support the creativity of the masses in the nationwide socialist competition to complete the post-war Stalin Five-Year Plan and to make our Soviet motherland more prosperous!

　　更多注意经济问题
    编者按：当我们国家逐步转入以生产建设为中心任务的时候，本报特发表真理报这篇《更多注意经济问题》的社论，以引起全国报纸与刊物的注意。
    我们苏维埃国家的社会主义经济，铲除了生产的无政府状态、危机、失业的恐惧、群众的贫穷、以及资本主义的其他疮痍和缺点。战后时期，我国的社会主义经济在资本主义经济面前，更屡次显示出其伟大优越性。
    在共产党的领导下，苏维埃人民在争取完成及超过战后斯大林五年计划的斗争里，获得了显赫的成就。在国民经济各主要部门，我们不仅已达到战前的生产水平，而且还超过了。
    我们的布尔什维克报刊——群众的集体宣传者、鼓动者和组织者，在争取国民经济的进一步发展、争取我们经济发展的更高速度以及争取社会主义竞赛新高潮的斗争中，应该负起重大作用。在我们国民经济发展的现阶段，给报刊提供出一切新而又新的、复杂而多方面的问题。这些问题需要深刻而全面地加以说明。
    远在一九一八年，列宁在其《论我们的报纸》一文中，即曾号召苏维埃的报纸要多研究经济问题，但这个经济并不是指“一般”推论。列宁写道：“……我们所要的经济，是指搜集、缜密检查及研究新生活的真正的建设各种事实而言……我们还很少用生活各方面的生动的具体的榜样和模范，去教育群众。而这正是报纸在从资本主义到社会主义过渡时期的主要任务”。斯大林同志也曾不止一次地着重指出，我们的报纸要在社会主义建设事业中负起重要的作用。在《竞赛与群众的劳动高涨》一文中，斯大林同志曾给我们报刊提出了这一任务：对于数百万劳动群众自己的切身事业的竞赛问题，要加以深刻的阐述。
    我们的报刊，执行着列宁与斯大林的指示，在阐明经济建设及社会主义竞赛问题方面，过去和现在都做了大量工作。我们的报刊，在展开全民的社会主义竞赛及斯塔哈诺夫运动中，在宣传生产革新者先进的劳动方法以及批评我们经济建设的缺点时，都曾起过重要的作用。即使现在，在争取提前完成战后斯大林五年计划的斗争中，报刊仍是我们的党——苏维埃人民一切胜利的鼓舞者及组织者——手中的有力武器。先进的报纸积极地支持一切新的、先进的事物，对落后的及腐朽的则进行不停的斗争。
    但是在我们报刊阐明经济问题时，还有严重的缺点存在。某些报纸脱离开了苏维埃经济发展中的最实际和最紧要的问题。例如，开米罗夫州报纸《古兹巴斯》报，这是全国最大产煤及冶金中心的报纸。但它很长时期都未曾说明过产煤工业中的这些重要问题：如采煤的机械化、运用新技术，在矿坑中劳动的组织及提高生产率诸问题。在该报关于经济问题的片断的浮浅的记事中，时常表现出该报编辑部本身的不学无术。
    或者我们举《高尔科夫公社》报做例——这是最大的机器建设中心的报纸。这个报纸在阐述经济问题时缺乏目的性，不会有始有终地连续报导——这即是该州报纸在说明经济问题时的风格。
    有些报纸不深刻研究农业问题。关于集体农场建设和集体农场劳动与生产的组织诸重要问题，只轻描淡写地加以叙述。例如，乌兹别克共和国报纸《东方真理报》，对争取严格地遵守农业劳动组合规章，对争取该共和国农业生产的主要部分——棉花——的机械化，都没有从事坚持的斗争。《卡萨赫斯坦真理报》对于阐明公共畜产的发展问题，也做得不够。
    为了有能力阐明苏维埃的经济问题，报刊的工作人员首先应该自己精通经济学的基本知识，应该更加深刻地研究经济问题并要时常到生产部门中去，应该熟识生产中的先进者们而且时常与他们交往，应该吸收熟知经济问题的积极作者参加到报纸中来。
    斯塔哈诺夫工作者是我们工业中的革新者。因此报纸的讲坛邀请生产革新者——斯塔哈诺夫工作者，邀请科学与技术活动者——学者和做工程师技师的知识分子们来讲话，在推广先进的经验方面，是具有重大意义的。
    列宁远在三十年以前即曾表示过这个希望：“尽可能使大量在群众中和群众一同工作的人、在现在生气勃勃的生活中工作着的人们，写出自己的经验。”
    列宁的指示，现在仍充分有其现实意义。可惜，我们某些报纸还时常刊有对经济一知半解的作者所写的空洞而缺乏内容的文章。
    当展开社会主义竞赛时，报纸应该为争取广泛采用新技术，争取生产过程的机械化及技术之进步而斗争。
    报纸的责任，是传播群众为了争取提前完成生产计划及提高产品质量的社会主义竞赛，是要力使全部企业都有规律的工作，使每一车间和工作小队均逐日逐月地完或并超额完成生产计划——这计划不仅包括产品的总产量，还一定要包括所制定的产品种类。必须时刻支持和发展群众的创造性。这些创造性可以表现在争取节约及超计划的积累，争取加速流动资金的运转，争取合理运用生产地段、更好地利用设备及一切主要生产手段和争取节省原料及材料诸方面。
    群众创造性的建议增长着，革新者的行列增加着，劳动者日新月异的新爱国创举发生着。近来，共青团女团员李基雅·柯拉别尔尼科娃的新创举，获得了广泛的传播。她与她的小组订出任务要每天超额完成计划并且每月之中有一天要用节省下来的材料工作。一等技师费道尔·库兹涅佐夫的创举也得到了普遍的响应。他在自己的工作段中曾保证用缩减材料零头的方法而很好的节省原料和材料。
    报纸如适时地注意新鲜事物，支持并推广革新者的经验，同时争取使其广泛采用于生产中，则报纸的功绩是伟大的。
    当宣传生产中先进者及革新者的经验时，我们的报刊应该同时对经济建设领域中的缺点，勇敢地展开布尔什维克的批评与自我批评。应该特别注意落后的工业部门，落后的企业、集体农场、机器拖拉机站与国营农场的工作。应该深刻发掘某一企业或地区落后的原因，批评缺点的具体负责人，坚决争取在共产主义建设所有部门中获得新的成就。
    要多加注意经济问题！使每一报纸都要深刻而有系统地阐明社会主义经济的最重要问题。支援群众在争取完成战后斯大林五年计划及争取我们苏维埃祖国更加富强的全民社会主义竞赛中的创造！（君强译自一九五○年四月一日真理报）
