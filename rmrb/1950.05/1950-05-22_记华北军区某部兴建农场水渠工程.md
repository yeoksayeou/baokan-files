　　A Record of the Construction of an Irrigation Canal Project by a Certain Unit of the North China Military Region's Farm

    In the past, this 4,500-mu wasteland had nothing but weeds, alkali patches, and crows circling and wailing; one couldn't see a single person. Since the arrival of the People's Liberation Army's surveying team and construction team, this place has become lively. Like observing terrain before a battle, the regimental leaders, together with the engineers, walked from here to there, guiding the companies in developing the land. They also consulted with experienced old farmers to learn from their practical experience.
    To turn this wasteland into fertile land, it was essential to dig canals to leach out the alkali first. This was the first arduous task in developing this rice farm. On the day of the groundbreaking ceremony, everyone raised their bright shovels high and swore an oath to the wasteland, determined to transform it into fertile land.
    The small villages around this wasteland were filled with troops, even the mill tracks and donkey sheds were packed. Look, every small adobe house has been turned into a small workshop: repairing wooden rulers, pasting paper flags, twisting straw ropes, mending shoes... There were also people who wrote shovel poems:
    My shovel is quick and bright,
    Happy in my hands, full of delight.
    Before, I held a gun to fight,
    Now I hold a shovel to develop the site.
    To develop the site, we first dig the canal,
    Rice paddies irrigated with a splashing sprawl.
    Rice seedlings watered, green and strong,
    Big ears, fat grains, long and pronged.
    Everyone started working with such joy. On this boundless wasteland, countless long formations were lined up, and numerous shovels were waving on the irrigation ditches, drainage ditches, main ditches, and branch ditches.
    However, difficulties were encountered in the first two days. Everyone lacked experience. The wooden stakes had widths and depths written on them, and they just dug accordingly, regardless of longitudinal or cross-sections, resulting in a lot of wasted effort.
    Therefore, each company established a technical research group. Before starting work each day, the specific tasks were clearly explained, and a demonstration was given. Inspection personnel were also sent out during the canal digging to measure each section, repairing any deviations from the required dimensions promptly. At the end of the day, the next day's project was also planned. In this way, every squad leader became a small engineer, and every soldier was able to master the techniques skillfully. While large organizations were being established, smaller organizations became more active. Three or four people formed a mutual aid group, those with better understanding enlightened those with weaker understanding, and those with greater strength helped those who were physically weaker. The soldiers called it "three-in-one," three people united in one heart, and their enthusiasm became even greater.
    The cadres planned meticulously, strengthened the organization, and everyone worked diligently. Many good methods were devised: when digging the main canal, those with greater strength dug the bottom of the canal, those with technical skills repaired the slopes on both sides, and those who were physically weaker followed behind to shovel away loose soil. After the outline was dug, people were assigned to compact the soil. Look, shovel after shovel of soil was constantly flying to both sides; the bottom of the canal was dug flat, and the slopes were smoothly repaired. When it came to digging the branch ditches, this division of labor changed again. One person dug the bottom of the canal backwards, two people on the left and right shaved the slopes on both sides, and the person opposite followed closely to shovel away loose soil. Four people with four shovels formed a cross shape, like a small machine, heading towards the direction where the brocade flag was flying.
    The ditches were getting deeper and deeper, and the reed roots formed a ground net. In addition, after two or three days of heavy rain, every ditch was filled with water. From Party members, labor models, cadres to soldiers, everyone jumped in, working with muddy feet and watery legs. Listen, challenges from the east, competitions from the west, even the battalion commander joined in. Truly, "a strong general has no weak soldiers under his command." Model squad leader Wang Xiaoquan pulled a large stone roller to compact the earth embankment, Zhang Dabao swung a large door panel to compact the soil. At the end of the day, many soldiers wore honorary flowers.
    From Plot A to Plot B, from this village to that village, gongs and drums sounded every morning and evening. Everyone washed their shovels clean and looked back at this wasteland. The wasteland had changed! Horizontal and vertical, large and small canals, connected together clearly, spreading out like a large net covering the land. How difficult it was! From the day of the groundbreaking ceremony on March 21st to the time of washing the shovels now, we used labor and technology to dig out 169,053 cubic meters of earth. If we connected these 1,236 canals together, they would be 400 li long.

　　记华北军区某部兴建农场水渠工程

    过去在这片四千五百亩的荒地上，除了野草、碱皮和盘旋悲鸣的乌鸦外，看不到一个人影。自从来了人民解放军的测量队、经始组，这块地方就热闹起来了。团首长像作战前观察地形一样，同工程师们从这边走到那边，指导各连队经始土地。又请老农谈实际经验。
    要把这片荒地变成良田，非得先挖渠洗碱不成，这便是开辟这片稻田农场的第一个艰巨任务。在举行动工典礼那天，所有的人，都高举起雪亮的铁锨，对着荒地宣了誓，决心把它变成良田。
    这片荒地周围的小村里都住满了队伍，连磨道上、驴棚里都住满了人。看吧，每间小土房都变成了小作坊：修木尺、糊纸旗、搓草绳、缝补鞋……。还有人写了铁锨诗：
    我的铁锨快又亮，
    拿在手中喜洋洋。
    从前拿枪来打仗，
    如今拿锨来开荒。
    开荒先把渠来挖，
    稻田灌水哗哗响。
    稻秧得水青又旺，
    穗大粒肥亭又长。
    大家都这样满心喜欢的开始动作了。在这望不到边际的荒地上，列开了无数长阵，在一条条运水沟、排水沟、干沟、支沟上无数的铁锨在挥舞着。
    可是，头两天就碰到了困难。大家都没有经验，木橛子上写着宽几米，深几米，就照样子挖下去，不管他什么纵断面、横断面，结果却做了不少的背工活。
    于是，各连都成立了技术研究组，每在开工以前，先把具体任务讲清，作出个样子示范，还在挖渠时派出检查员，到每一工段去测量，不合尺寸的及时修理，收工时又布置了明天的工程。这样每个班长都成了小工程师，每个战士也能熟练的掌握技术了。大的组织建立起来了，小的组织也更活跃起来，三、四个人一个互助组，认识好的开导思想差的，气力大的帮助身体弱的，战士们把它叫作“三合一”，三个人团结一条心，劲头儿就更大了。
    干部们精心计划，加强了组织，大家也就用心啦。想出了许多好办法：挖干沟是由气力大的挖渠底，有技术的修理两边斜坡，身体弱的跟在后边铲浮土；等到挖成了轮廓，就分出人来拍积土。看吧，一锨一锨的泥土，不断的飞向两边去；渠底挖得平展展，斜坡修得光溜溜。到了挖支沟的时候，这种分工又变啦，一个人倒退着挖渠底，左右两个人在两边削斜坡，对面的那个人紧跟着铲浮土，四个人四把铁锨，正好构成了一个十字形，像一架一架的小机器似的，向飘扬着锦旗的方向开去。
    沟，越挖越深了，苇子根组成了地网，再加上下了两三天大雨，每道沟里都注满了水。从党员、劳动模范、干部到战士，都跳下了去，一脚泥一脚水的干起来。听吧，东边挑战，西边比赛，营长也加入了，真是“强将手下无弱兵”，模范班长王小泉拉起大石滚子压土埂，张大保抡起一面大门扇拍积土，收工的时候，不少战士都戴了光荣花。
    从甲号地到乙号地，从这村到那村，每早每晚都响着锣鼓声，大家洗干净铁锨，回头望着这片荒野，荒野变了样啦，横横竖竖，大大小小的水渠，脉络分明的连结在一起，散布开来，像是一面大网似的罩在土地上。这是多么不容易呵！由三月二十一日动工典礼那天起，到现在洗铁锨的时候，我们用劳动和技术，挖出了十六万九千零五十三方土，如果把这一千二百三十六条渠接连起来，足有四百里长。
