    The entire staff of the Jilin Provincial Department Store Rubber Factory was working hard to increase production to welcome the "May 1st" International Labor Day and the "May 4th" Youth Day when they saw the news in the newspaper that 150,000 of Shanghai's working-class brothers were unemployed. Although everyone was busy with production, the whole factory knew about it before noon. Everyone expressed their utmost sympathy for the unemployed worker brothers in Shanghai; at the same time, it increased their hatred for the heinous crimes of American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit gang.
    During the midday break, all the employees gathered at the club for a meeting. After the chairman of the trade union explained why the meeting was being held, he read the news from the newspaper. When he read about the difficult living conditions of the unemployed workers in Shanghai, every worker and staff member felt very sad. A worker named Guo raised his hand and said in an excited voice: "I have two suggestions on this matter: First, let's donate a day's wages to the unemployed worker brothers in Shanghai; second, from now on, we must work harder to increase production, complete our tasks ahead of schedule, and support the front lines!" Before he could finish, everyone shouted in unison: "Agreed! Agreed!" The meeting ended in just half an hour.
    The sound of sewing machines rang out, but the voices of the workers were louder than the sound of the machines. The workers in several workshops were all saying: "I'll donate 50,000 [old] yuan, I'll donate 100,000, I'll donate 150,000..." It turned out that everyone felt that the amount decided at the meeting of contributing one day's work was too small, so they reported the amount of their donations while working.
    In the office, the chairman of the trade union was urging a staff member who was working on the abacus: "Are you finished? How much is it in total? Hurry up, so the factory can disburse it and send it to the superior trade union, so it can be mailed to Shanghai as soon as possible." A barber who was not from our factory came to our factory and said, "Workers all over the world are one family, we should help our unemployed worker friends in Shanghai." After saying that, he took out 50,000 yuan from his waist and handed it over. A female comrade, Wang Lianying, was unable to participate in the morning because she was repairing a machine. After hearing about this, she immediately took out 100,000 yuan. She also said: "It's not enough for us to do this. In the future, we must create more new records and complete the production tasks ahead of schedule before 'May 1st'!" Comrades Chang Yong'an and Wang Zhong also said: "In the future, we must work harder, increase production, support the front lines, and liberate Tibet, Hainan Island and Taiwan as soon as possible!"

　　帮助上海失业工人弟兄
    ——记吉林省营百货公司橡胶厂员工的献工
    田垦
    吉林省营百货公司橡胶厂，全体职工正在加劲生产，迎接“五一”节国际劳动节和“五四”纪念日的时候，在报上看到上海工人阶级弟兄十五万人失业的消息。虽然大家忙着生产，但没有等到晌午，全厂的人都知道了这事。每人都对上海失业工人弟兄，表示万分的同情；同时也更增加了对美帝和国民党匪帮滔天罪行的仇恨。
    午间休息时，全体职工在俱乐部集合开会。工会主席说完为什么开会之后，就读报上的消息，当他读到上海失业工人生活困苦情形时，每个工人和职员都很难过。一位姓郭的工友高举着手，用激动的声音说：“我对这事我有两点意见：第一、献一天工资捐给上海失业工人弟兄；第二、今后我们更要加紧生产，提前完成任务、支援前线！”他还没有说完，全体一致喊着：“同意！同意！”会议就在这短短的半点钟里开完。
    缝纫机声响起来，但工友们说话的声音，却比机器的声音还高。几个车间的工友们，都在说着：“我五万元、我十万、我十五万元……”原来大家嫌会上决定献工一天这数目太小了，所以他们一边干着活，一边却报着捐献的数目。
    办公室里，工会主席正催促着打算盘的一位职员：“打完了没有？一共多少钱？快点，好叫厂方支出送给上级工会，好早一刻邮到上海去。”有一位不是咱厂的理发工人，正到咱们厂里来，他说：“天下工人是一家，我们应该帮助上海的失业工友。”说完顺腰里也掏出五万元来交上，一位女同志王莲英，在头晌因为修理机器没能参加，听到这个事后，立即拿出了十万元。她还说：“我们光这样作还不算，今后我们还要多多创造新纪录，提前在‘五一’前完成生产任务！”常永安和王忠两位工友并说：“今后更要加劲的干，增加生产，支援前线，很快解放西藏、海南岛和台湾！”
