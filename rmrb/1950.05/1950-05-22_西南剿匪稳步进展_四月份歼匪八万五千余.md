Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 20th: The People's Liberation Army Southwest Military Region units eliminated over 85,000 bandits in bandit suppression operations in April, exceeding the total number of bandits eliminated in February and March. The bandit suppression struggle in the Southwest Military Region has now entered a new stage.

　　In April, under the unified leadership of the bandit suppression guiding principles, our army further employed the tactics of concentrating forces and focusing on encirclement and suppression, overcame various difficulties, and demonstrated a high degree of revolutionary heroism in eliminating harm for the people. Our army also achieved great results in combining military suppression with political offensives. The internal situation of the remaining bandits is extremely unstable, and the number of those surrendering and starting anew is increasing daily. The overall bandit situation in the region continues to decline, and some areas have completely eliminated the major bandit groups. The remnants of bandits in eastern Sichuan have been forced to flee into the peripheral mountainous areas; our army in northern Sichuan has entered the mopping-up stage, and a portion of the bandits in southern Sichuan have been forced to flee from the north bank of the Yangtze River to the south; in mid-April, the bandits in the western Sichuan Plain attempted to stir up trouble again, but were largely annihilated by our concentrated forces; the Guizhou Military Region has also entered a stage of steady suppression; only Yunnan, due to its later liberation, still has bandits stirring up trouble. Preliminary statistics of the bandit suppression results in April are as follows:

　　(1) A total of 85,433 bandits were eliminated. This includes 23,480 in eastern Sichuan, 19,529 in western Sichuan, 16,074 in southern Sichuan, 9,305 in northern Sichuan, 10,890 in Guizhou, 4,456 in Yunnan, and 1,699 in Xikang.

　　(2) 13,998 bandits were killed, including Wang Hongji, commander of the 18th Army of the "Anti-Communist National Salvation Army," and others below him.

　　(3) 41,817 bandits were captured, including Deng Mengru, guerrilla commander of the "Fengdu, Changshou, Fuling, Dianjiang Border Area Anti-Communist Column," and others below him.

　　(4) 29,618 bandits surrendered and started anew, including Liu Boden, deputy commander-in-chief of the "People's Salvation Army," and others below him.

　　(5) Over 100 artillery pieces of various types, over 46,000 various guns, and a large amount of other ammunition, weapons, and military supplies were seized.
