How to Strengthen Public Grain Storage Work
　　Mao Zichang

Now that the weather is getting warmer and humidity is rising, it is the season when grain is prone to mildew and spoilage. As early as April 11th, the Central Financial and Economic Commission issued instructions on strengthening public grain storage work, pointing out the serious defects existing in public grain storage work in various places, and putting forward the policy of strengthening grain depot storage. The comrades of the financial and grain management departments at all levels should carefully study this important instruction, vigorously implement the spirit of the instruction, and do a good job in the grain depot storage work in various places. Here are some situations in the public grain storage work in the Northwest, provided for reference in various places, and to arouse some vigilance and attention.

　　(1) According to incomplete reports from several regions, the losses in our public grain storage are extremely large. More than 800,000 jin of grain and flour have been mildewed and spoiled. In Chaoyi alone, there are more than 400,000 jin that are currently feverish and at risk of rotting. More than one million jin of public grass have rotted. In addition, there are currently many regions shouting that grain is feverish and moldy, requesting loans to the masses or asking for instructions on disposal methods. This shows that the crisis of large-scale grain mildew and spoilage is serious and widespread.

　　(2) When reviewing the reasons for public grain mildew and damage, in the past, it was often mostly blamed on objective conditions, such as saying that warehouse equipment was simple, cadres lacked storage experience, the system was unsound, and support-the-front work was chaotic, etc. In short, there was only one conclusion: "It is due to objective reasons and conditions. It is limited, beyond human power, and the mildew and spoilage of grain is inevitable. We are not responsible." It is undeniable that objective reasons and conditions can be factors that cause grain mildew and spoilage in certain occasions and periods, but under the same objective conditions, some regions can properly store grain, while others experience serious mildew. What is the reason? The main reason is that there are several incorrect views on grain storage work among our cadres, specifically manifested as follows:

　　First, some leaders and some cadres have the view of emphasizing collection and neglecting storage, thinking that once public grain is collected into the warehouse, everything is fine.

　　Second, the view of emphasizing finance and neglecting grain still plays a considerable role in the thinking of many of our cadres. If the treasury is short of funds, even if it is a small amount, it will be repeatedly checked to get to the bottom of it. If the grain depot is mildewed and rotted, and the amount is calculated into money, although it is many times greater than the amount of money lost, it is often ignored, or considered inevitable and not dealt with.

　　Third, the custodians do not value their responsibilities, thinking that this work is hard and dirty, with no future and no prospects, or simply regard the public grain storage work as "temple work," not paying attention to studying storage methods, doing the job perfunctorily, and sometimes not even ringing the bell. On the other hand, some leading comrades do not pay attention to strengthening the allocation of custodians. As far as we know now, the quality of grain depot cadres in various regions is generally poor and their sense of responsibility is not strong.

　　Fourth, some cadres have a sense of peace and麻痹思想, paying no attention to public grain storage and not being vigilant, resulting in theft, robbery and other incidents. For example, a warehouse in Gan County was stolen more than 3,800 jin of public grain.

　　In addition, the comrades in the grain management department have a bureaucratic style of work, their inspection work is insufficient, or they are sloppy, perfunctory, or only look at large warehouses and not small warehouses, or only look at the surface of the grain to see if it has changed, not looking at the bottom of the warehouse, or only rely on verbal and written instructions and orders, but do not go out of the office to go deep into the warehouse for specific practical inspections. Once the grain is mildewed, the upper and lower levels complain to each other and push responsibility to each other.

　　When entering the warehouse, some regions do not check the quality of the grain carefully enough, and receive and store dry, wet, good, and bad mixed together, which has an impact on the mildew and damage of the grain. On the one hand, the cadres in charge of storage are afraid of offending people and fear of trouble, so they are sloppy and do not check carefully. On the other hand, there are even cadres who do not understand the overall situation and lead the masses to hand in bad grain. Such things have happened among cadres in Anse County.

　　The above shows that our spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people is not enough. We have not recognized that the public grain is the grain that the masses have exchanged with their hard work and sweat, and it is given to us to support the war and production and construction. If we do not take good care of it and the public grain suffers from mildew and damage, it means that the state property is damaged. This is a sinful behavior and should be blamed by the people and sanctioned by government laws.

　　(3) How to do a good job in public grain storage? First of all, we must overcome several incorrect ideological understandings of public grain storage work, and from top to bottom, clarify the importance of public grain storage work politically. We must recognize that public grain is the blood and sweat of the people, and it is an important property of the country. Doing a good job in public grain storage is a concrete manifestation of the idea of serving the people.

　　Secondly, the financial and grain authorities at all levels should organize forces to conduct in-depth inspections with emphasis. In places where mildew and damage have occurred, they should be held responsible at each level. We should oppose the past habit of only emphasizing objective reasons and not reviewing subjective efforts, and strictly establish a system of special responsibility for storage work, ending the phenomenon of everyone being responsible, relying on each other, and as a result, no one being responsible.

　　Third, the grain authorities should carefully study storage methods, widely absorb storage methods and experience from various places, and visit and discuss with people or old farmers who have long-term experience in storing grain, and promote and adopt them in a timely manner. Of course, scientific storage methods should be modernized as much as possible under possible conditions. However, due to our limited conditions, it will take a period of time to widely adopt modern scientific storage methods. At present, we should still focus on summarizing old experiences and studying local methods, and require improvement on the basis of existing storage. We should oppose blindly pursuing modern equipment and neglecting the research and improvement of storage methods and storage experience under the current economic conditions.

　　Fourth, a regular inspection system should be established, such as checking once after each rain, the county depot should check every few days, the district depot should check every few days, and the provincial grain bureau should organize forces to conduct spot checks with emphasis. After each inspection, it must be reported to the higher level level by level. We must oppose the bad habit of ignoring it at ordinary times and shouting everywhere when mildew and damage are found.

　　Fifth, we should mobilize the masses to protect grain and supervise the masses. Especially in the Northwest region, which is vast, inconvenient to transport, with simple and scattered warehouses, and a large number of civilian houses are borrowed, which is inconvenient to take care of, we should mobilize the masses around the grain depot to assist in protecting grain, preventing fire and theft. We must make the masses realize the relationship between grain mildew and their own interests in order to enhance their consciousness of protecting grain and thus supervising the work of the custodians.

　　(4) As mentioned above, many grains have been found to be mildewed in various places, and many more will be mildewed. It is hoped that governments and grain authorities at all levels will take urgent measures to deal with them as soon as possible. Further delay will make even greater mistakes.

　　In order to cherish the wealth of the country and cherish the blood and sweat of the people, we deeply hope to work hard to implement the strengthening of public grain storage work.

### 如何加强公粮保管工作

　　如何加强公粮保管工作
　　毛子长
    现在天气渐暖，湿气上升，是粮食容易霉坏的季节。还在四月十一日，中央财经委员会即颁布了关于加强公粮保管工作的指示，指出各地公粮保管工作中存在的严重缺陷，并提出加强粮库保管的方针。这一个重要指示，各级财粮管理部门的同志们应认真研究，大力贯彻指示精神，做好各地的粮库保管工作。兹就西北公粮保管工作中的一些情况，提供各地参考，并借以引起一些警惕和注意。
    （一）据几个地区不完全的报告看，我们在公粮保管中的损失，数目至为庞大，粮食面粉霉坏八十余万斤，现在发烧有霉烂危险的仅朝邑一地就有四十余万斤，公草沤坏的达百余万斤，此外现在有不少地区在叫喊着粮食发烧霉沤，要求贷给群众或请示处理办法，这说明了粮食大量被霉坏的危机严重地普遍地存在着。
    （二）公粮霉损，检讨原因时，过去往往多半归罪于客观条件，如说仓库设备简陋，干部保管经验不足，制度不健全，支前工作混乱等等。总之，这样那样，只有一个结论：“是由于客观原因，条件限制，非人力所能为，粮食霉损势所难免，我们不负责任。”不容否认，客观原因客观条件在某种场合某一时期是会造成粮食霉损的因素，但是在同样客观条件下，有的地区能妥善地保管粮食，有的地区却发生严重的霉烂，其原因究竟何在呢？主要是我们干部中对粮食保管工作存在着几种不正确的观点，具体表现如下：
    第一、在个别领导及某些干部中存在着重视征收、轻视保管的观点，认为公粮一经催收入仓，便万事大吉。
    第二、重财轻粮的观点在我们许多干部思想中仍起着相当支配作用。设使钱库短了款，那怕是微小的数目，势必反复查对，求个究竟，如果粮库霉烂了粮，折成钱数计算，虽比之所丢失的钱额不知要大多少倍，然常熟视无睹，或认为势所难免，不予置理。
    第三、保管人员不重视自己的职责，认为此工作是吃苦吃土，没有前途没有出息，或简单的将公粮保管工作视为“照庙工作”，不注意研究保管方法，当一天和尚撞一天钟，甚至有时连钟也不撞。另方面有些领导同志，不注意加强保管人员的配备。就现在了解，各地区粮库干部，一般质量很差，责任心不强。
    第四、部分干部存在着太平观念、麻痹思想，对公粮保管不加注意，警惕性不高，致使被盗被劫等事发生，如干县某仓库就被盗去公粮三千八百余斤。
    此外，粮食管理部门同志，存在着官僚主义作风，检查工作不够，或粗枝大叶走马观花，漂浮的检查，或只看大仓不看小仓，或只从粮食的表面看变样不变样，不看仓底如何，或者只凭口头的书面的下指示下命令，而不走出办公室深入仓库作具体的实际的检查，一遇粮食发生霉烂，上下互相埋怨，互推责任。
    在入仓时有些地区对粮食质量的检查不够认真，干的湿的好的歹的混合接收保管，对粮食霉损不无影响，这一方面是负保管工作的干部，怕得罪人、怕麻烦，于是马马虎虎不认真检查，而另方面竟然还有不明大义的干部率领群众交坏粮，安塞县干部中即曾发生过此类事情。
    以上种种，说明了我们真心真意为人民服务的精神不够，没认清公粮是群众辛勤劳动以血汗换得的粮食交给我们，用之于支援战争和生产建设，我们不去很好的保管，而使公粮遭受霉损，也就是使国家财产受到损失，这是罪恶的行为，应该受到人民的责备，政府法律的制裁。
    （三）如何做好公粮保管工作呢？首先要克服对公粮保管工作的几种不正确的思想认识，自上而下地从政治上阐明公粮保管工作的重要性，要认清公粮是人民的血汗，是国家的重要财产，作好公粮保管工作，就是为人民服务的思想具体的表现。
    其次各级财粮主管部门应有重点的组织力量深入检查，发生霉损的地方，要逐级负责，反对过去只强调客观原因，不检讨主观努力的毛病，严格的建立起保管工作的专人负责制，终止大家负责，互相依靠，结果大家不负责任的现象。
    第三粮食主管部门应该认真研究保管方法，广泛吸取各地保管方法和经验，并向长期保管粮食有经验的人或老农访问座谈，及时推广采用。当然科学的保管方法，在可能条件下，尽量求其现代化，但由于我们条件所限，普遍采用现代化的科学保管办法，尚须一个时期，目前仍应着重总结旧经验，研究土办法，在现有保管基础上要求提高一步，反对一味追求现代化的设备，而忽视现在经济条件下的保管方法和保管经验的研究改进。
    第四应订出定期的检查制度，比如每逢雨后应检查一次，县库应该几日检查一次，区库应该几日检查一次，省粮食局应组织力量有重点的进行抽查，每次检查后，必须逐级向上报告，反对平时不管，发现霉损时到处叫喊的不良作风。
    第五应发动群众护粮，群众监督，特别是像西北地区辽阔，交通不便，仓库简陋并分散，同时借用民房为数不少，照料不便，应该发动粮库周围群众协助护粮，防火防盗，要使群众认识粮食霉损与其切身利益的关系，以增强其自觉的进行护粮并从而监督保管人员的工作。
    （四）上面谈过各地已经发现许多粮食被霉损，还有许多将要霉烂，希望各级政府和粮食主管部门赶快采取紧急措施设法处理，如再拖延将要犯更大的错误。
    为爱护国家财富、痛惜人民血汗，深望为贯彻加强公粮保管工作而努力。
