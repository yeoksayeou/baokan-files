Chairman Mao Liberated Us

A nearly fifty-year-old woman recounts how Chairman Mao saved her and her daughter and how, inspired by Chairman Mao, she participated in the "May Day" celebration in the rain.

Comrade Editor:

I am a woman nearing fifty, left over from the old society, raising my daughter alone in Beijing. Unfortunately, she contracted a serious illness, and after years of treatment, with no relatives to rely on in a strange land, I reached a point of desperation. Helpless, I wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, asking for his help. Unexpectedly, he showed such concern for our mother and daughter's plight, entrusting my daughter to the Ministry of Health and instructing them to treat her on his behalf. Minister Fu and the secretaries of the Ministry of Health visited our home continuously and took her to Beijing Hospital, where renowned Chinese and Soviet doctors provided treatment. At the same time, to alleviate my difficulties, Chairman Mao also arranged a job for me, allowing a destitute mother and daughter to find life from the brink of death. The great kindness of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party is beyond repayment. Under Chairman Mao's great banner, I also participated in the May Day parade. Now I write down some of my thoughts from that day to express my respect and love for Chairman Mao.

On May Day afternoon, the rain kept falling, but I set off with a happy heart. I arrived at Daruanfu Elementary School and followed the procession towards Dongdan Square. We stayed on East Chang'an Avenue for a long time, seeing teams from various organizations marching enthusiastically from east to west and from west to east, demonstrating the great strength of the working people. I felt indescribably happy, and seeing the female comrades of our Democratic Women's Federation, marching in such orderly ranks, holding flowers, and moving forward with light steps, I felt that this was truly the phenomenon of an era of gender equality! All of this is the result of Chairman Mao leading us to smash the feudal shackles of thousands of years, enabling us to enjoy the protection of the Marriage Law, which guarantees freedom and happiness. Our women's rights have been improved in all aspects of politics and economics, unlike the empty slogans of the Jiang bandits era. In the era when the Jiang bandits were in power, there was no room for ordinary women to gain a foothold in government organizations. Today, Chairman Mao has created this new China for our working people, and especially we women have truly obtained equality and freedom. In my opinion, this is a perfect example. In the old society, how could an old and poor woman like me have been qualified to participate in such a grand meeting? How honored I am to be able to participate in this meeting today! I have received the benefits of the government and the grace of Chairman Mao, and the wind and rain could not stop me from coming to participate in this commemorative meeting. Although the comrades in my organization, showing consideration for my age, frailty, and weak legs, advised me, "Such heavy rain, Comrade Sun, it's okay if you don't participate!" But I thought of Chairman Mao leading the revolution through all kinds of hardships, and the revolutionary comrades enduring thirty years of hard struggle, braving wind and rain, climbing ice and lying in snow, as if it were commonplace. Now that liberation has been won and the working people have become the masters, how many martyrs have sacrificed for us so that we can enjoy today's freedom. How could we fear this little wind and rain on our joyous celebration day? In fact, in such a large meeting, it doesn't matter whether I am there or not, but my inner excitement and full of enthusiasm motivated me to move forward, Chairman Mao's love attracted me, and I wholeheartedly wanted to look up to Chairman Mao's face. I thought that lagging behind in my pace was inevitable, but I did not expect to fall in the procession, and I was very ashamed, but then I immediately thought: "What does falling matter? Our bones are hard, get up and move forward again!" No matter if it rains, the road is muddy, or I fall, it can't stop my strong will! When I arrived at Tiananmen Square, I saw from afar Chairman Mao, whom I had long admired. His amiable attitude and majestic and robust physique made me feel how great our new China's leader is. I couldn't help but shout "Long live!" incessantly. He is working day and night for the people, and his body is still so healthy. I felt relieved, forgetting my fatigue. I had long missed Chairman Mao, and today I finally saw him!

　　毛主席解救了我们
    一个年近五十的妇女述说毛主席怎样救了她们母女以及她怎样在毛主席的感召下冒雨参加“五一”编辑同志：
    我是一个年近五十的旧社会留下来的女人，单身带着女儿来北京。不幸她身染重病，经年不治，我以异乡人举目无亲，到了山穷水尽的境界，无奈给毛主席写了一封信，求他老人家帮忙。想不到他对我们母女的遭遇如此关切，把我女儿交给卫生部，要他们代为治疗。卫生部傅部长及秘书以下各同志均曾不断到家看视，并把她接到北京医院，由中苏名医代为诊治。同时，毛主席为了解救我的困难，又给我安置了工作，使贫苦无告的母女在死境中获得生机，毛主席和共产党的大恩是报不尽的。在毛主席的大旗下，我也参加了五一节大游行，现在把那一天的一点感想写出来，表示我对主席的一点敬爱。
    五一那一天下午，雨落个不停，我怀着愉快的心情出发了。到大阮府小学，跟着队伍就往东单广场行进，在东长安街停留好久，见各机关队伍有从东往西的，有由西往东的，都是兴致勃勃的前进，表现了劳动人民的伟大力量。我心有说不出来的高兴，又看见我们民主妇联的女同志们，队伍那样整齐，手执鲜花，步伐轻快的前进，使我感到这才是真正男女平等时代所应有的现象！这全是毛主席领导我们打垮了几千年来封建枷锁的结果。使我们得享自由幸福的婚姻法的保障。我们女权在政治经济各方面都提高了，再不像那蒋匪时代空喊口号。在蒋匪当权的时代，没有平民妇女在机关里插足的余地。今天毛主席给我们劳动人民造成这个新中国，尤其是我们妇女真正的得到了平等自由。依我来说就是实例。在旧社会里，我这老迈贫苦的妇人，那有参加这隆重大会的资格呢？我今天能参加这个大会是多么的荣幸啊！政府的好处，主席的恩典，我都领受了，风雨也阻不住我来参加这个纪念会。虽然我们机关的同志们，体恤我年老体笨，腿脚不健，劝我说：“这样大雨，孙同志不去参加也成！”但是我想到毛主席领导革命历尽艰苦，革命战士同志们经过三十年来的苦斗，栉风沐雨，爬冰卧雪，视为平常，如今解放胜利，劳动人民做了主人，多少先烈为我们牺牲，使我们得享今天的自由，难道在我们欢腾庆祝的日子，还怕这小小风雨么？其实这么大的会，有我没我，本无足轻重，但我内心的兴奋，满腔的热情鼓动着我前进，毛主席的慈爱吸引着我，我一心一意的想瞻仰毛主席的容颜。我自想步伐落后是难免的，却没想到还在队伍中跌倒了，我真惭愧极了，但，马上又想到：“跌倒算什么？我们骨头硬，爬起来再前进！”不管你天下雨，路泥泞，跌跟斗，都阻挡不住我坚强的意志！到了天安门，我远远的望见了我久所敬慕的毛主席，他那和蔼可亲的态度，雄伟健壮的体魄，使我感到我们新中国的领袖是何等的伟大，不由的高呼万岁不止。他为人民日夜劳瘁，身体还是如此健康，我心中感到安慰，忘却疲乏，久所怀念的毛主席，今天总算见着了！
