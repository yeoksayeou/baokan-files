　　North China Military Region Troops Actively Engage in Production
    210,000 Mu of Irrigated and Dry Land Mostly Sown and Planted
    300 Million Cubic Meters of Water Conservancy Projects to be Completed Before and After the Flood Season

    [Our Newspaper] The various units of the North China Military Region have already achieved initial successes in production. In terms of agriculture: The military region has dozens of large and small farms, totaling over 211,350 mu of irrigated and dry land (excluding five units in the Suiyuan Military Region). After the end of March, the troops went to the farms one after another. Now, most of the 100,000+ mu of dry land has been sown with spring wheat, barley, ramie, corn, soybeans, and cotton, among other crops. All of the rice paddies have completed the construction of irrigation canals and have been plowed once. The second plowing is in progress, and seedling cultivation, water lifting, and bridge and gate construction are underway. The farm of a certain regiment, with over 3,000 mu of rice paddies, completed the first plowing on April 11th and constructed 979 canals, large and small, with a total length of 338 li. They have now completed the second plowing and built seven large water gates and twenty-seven diversion gates, as well as water-lifting machines and other equipment. They have completed all the work on 114 mu of rice seedling cultivation land and started watering in late April to try and finish transplanting the rice seedlings in all the rice paddies by the end of May. On the 200,000+ mu of land cultivated by the various units of the military region, dozens of relatively large state-run farms have emerged. For example, a certain unit's 7,100 mu rice farm, with crisscrossing ditches and fertile land, has seven 50-horsepower axial-flow water-lifting machines with 60 cm diameter outlets which have started irrigating continuously. It is estimated that all the irrigated and dry land of the various units can be planted on time.

    In terms of water conservancy projects: All units of the army are carrying out work such as river dredging, levee restoration, canal opening, and dam construction on 23 rivers including the Yongding River, Hai River, Luan River, Hutuo River, Ziya River, and Sanggan River in various provinces of North China, contracting for a total of over 4,950,000 workdays with the North China and various provincial water conservancy bureaus, and moving over 300,664,000 cubic meters of earth (Editor's note: On April 19th, this newspaper reported that the North China troops contracted for 3,385,000 workdays. At that time, due to incomplete statistics, the current figures are more accurate). Some projects have now been completed, and most have completed more than one-half to two-thirds, and have been inspected and repaired to meet the required engineering standards. However, the troops not only lack experience in carrying out this work, but also find it very difficult to dig and transport earth in many places due to the outflow of water from the canals and the intertwined reeds. Without housing, they build their own mat sheds, and when it rains, the mat sheds leak, making life very difficult. At the same time, the work is often delayed due to rain. However, through the efforts of all commanders and fighters, enduring hardships and overcoming difficulties, production efficiency is still 20% to 250% higher than that of ordinary civilian workers. For example, a certain artillery regiment completed the entire 34-day project in 14 days. A certain military unit completed half of the 1,030,000+ cubic meters of earthwork by April 15th. A certain unit was building a road for a reservoir on the left bank of the Yongding River. In the process of opening mountains and building roads, the first squad of the artillery company, under the leadership of squad leader Xiao Wangzi, constantly studied technology collectively and created two methods of opening mountains and digging earth: "slope-shaped automatic earth removal" and "digging empty to create large blocks," achieving an amazing record of digging 14.8 cubic meters of earth per person per day, nearly four times the original plan of three cubic meters of earth per day. Under their influence, the production efficiency of the entire company has greatly improved, reaching an average of seven to eight cubic meters of earth dug per person per day. It is estimated that all the 300 million+ cubic meters of earthwork in the entire military region can be completed before the major flood season in late June, except for individual projects that encounter insurmountable mud and water siltation and other special difficulties that require increased labor, to ensure that no water disasters occur when the rainy season comes.

    In addition, the various units of the North China Military Region are also heavily involved in industry and handicraft workshops. According to current statistics, the various units have opened a total of 70 factories and workshops including iron and wood, dyeing and weaving, chemical, leather, papermaking, and coal mining, but due to insufficient funds, the scale is generally small. There are a total of 357 handicraft workshops including oil mills, flour mills, sauce and vinegar workshops, and tofu workshops, of which tofu workshops are the most numerous, with a total of 212, producing product lines for the troops' own use. In addition, more than 22,000 edible livestock and poultry such as pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks are raised, and 550 horses are raised in the horse farms.

    Hundreds of thousands of commanders and fighters throughout the army, except for those who must stick to their office work and a portion of the coastal defense and garrison troops, have participated in this vigorous production campaign. After Chairman Mao issued instructions in December of last year that the army should participate in production, all units entered a period of intense ideological, organizational, and material preparation work. From the military region down to each company, the party committees and military, political, and logistical organs at all levels went through repeated research and discussions to determine the production guidelines and specific steps, conducted mobilization education for the troops, and established production leadership organizations at all levels, while carrying out various large-scale material preparations. By mid-March of this year, the production army had gone to the production front one after another. In the production labor of the past two months, the above great achievements have been created, laying a solid foundation for completing the annual production tasks.

　　华北军区部队积极生产
    二十一万亩水旱田大部播种插秧
    三亿土方水利工程大汛前后可完成
    【本报讯】华北军区各部队生产已有初步成绩。农业方面：全军区大小农场数十处，共有水旱地二十一万一千三百五十余亩（绥远军区五个单位未计在内）。各部队于三月下旬以后即陆续开赴农场，现在十多万亩旱地大部已种上了春麦、大麦、青麻、玉米、大豆及棉花等作物。全部水稻地已完成了水渠工程，翻过头遍，正进行二遍翻地；并进行了育苗工作与扬水、桥闸等建设工程。某团农场三千多亩水稻地，四月十一日即完成了头遍犁地工作，并修建了大小九百七十九条水渠，全长达三百三十八华里；现已完成二遍犁地，并建筑了七个巨大的水闸和二十七个分水闸及扬水机等设备，完成了一百十四亩稻秧育苗地的全部工作，并开始放水，四月下旬播种，争取五月下旬全部稻田插秧完毕。全军区各部队所耕种的二十多万亩土地上，出现了数十个相当规模的国营农场，如某部七千一百亩的水稻农场，沟渠纵横，土地肥沃，七座五十马力六十公分口径的轴流式扬水机滔滔不绝地开始了灌溉。估计各部队全部水旱地可保不误农时。
    水利工程方面：全军各部在华北各省的永定河、海河、滦河、滹沱河、子牙河、桑乾河等二十三条河流上进行挖河、复堤、开渠、筑坝等工作，共向华北及各省水利局包工四百九十五万余工，三亿零六百六十四万余土方（编者按：四月十九日本报报道华北部队包工三百三十八万五千工，当时因统计不全，现在的数字较前精确）。现在部分工程已完工，一般的已完成二分之一到三分之二以上，并经过检查修整，使之适合工程要求标准。但部队进行这一工作，不但缺乏经验，且许多地方因渠道出水和苇根纵横纠缠，挖土运土都很费力；没有住处，自搭席棚，又遇到雨天，席棚漏湿，生活十分艰苦；同时常因下雨耽误工作，但是经过全体指战员的努力，忍受艰苦，克服困难，生产效率仍比一般民工高出百分之二十到二百五十。如某炮兵团三十四天的工程十四天即全部完成；某军一百零三万余的土方工程，到四月十五日即已完成一半。某部在永定河左岸为某处水库修建公路，在开山修路过程中，该部炮兵连第一班，在班长萧枉子领导下，不断集体研究技术，创造了“坡形自动排土”和“挖空打大块”两种开山挖土法，达到了每人每天挖土十四点八立方公尺的惊人纪录，超过原订计划每天三立方土将近四倍。并在他们的影响下，全连生产效率大为提高，达到每人每天挖土七、八方的平均数。估计全军区三万万以上土方工程，除个别工程遭到不可克服的泥水淤阻等特殊困难须要增加劳动力外，一般在六月底大汛前都可完成，保证雨季来到时免遭水患。
    此外，华北军区各部队并大量经营工业与手工作坊，据现在统计，各部队开设工厂、工场有铁木、染织、化学、皮革、造纸、采煤等共计七十处，但因资金不足，一般规模不大。手工作坊有油坊、粉坊、酱醋坊、豆腐坊等共三百五十七所，其中豆腐坊为最多，共二百十二所，生产品系供给部队自用。此外喂养猪羊鸡鸭等食用畜禽二万二千余只，牧马场喂马五百五十匹。
    全军数十万指战员，除必要坚持机关工作和一部分海防及留守部队外，大部人员参加了这一轰轰烈烈的生产运动。从去年十二月毛主席发布军队参加生产的指示后，各单位就进入紧张的思想、组织与物质准备工作。从军区直到每个连队，各级党委和军政后勤机关，经过反复的研究讨论，确定生产方针与具体步骤，向部队进行动员教育，成立各级生产领导机构，同时进行各项庞大的物质准备。到今年三月中旬，生产大军即陆续开赴生产前线。二月来的生产劳动中，已经创造出以上伟大的成绩，给完成全年生产任务打下了坚实的基础。
