Xinhua News Agency, New York, May 17th: Tass, New York, May 15th: The American "Mothers Against War Association" recently announced to reporters that the group sent letters to Stalin and Truman on Mother's Day (according to the United States, this year's Mother's Day was May 14th), promising to do their utmost to prevent a third world war. The letter was signed by 2,300 mothers from 42 states, stating: "We mothers, faced with the threat of a third world war that will destroy humanity, feel obliged to take the strongest possible action within our power to prevent this war. We did not bring our children into this world to be cannon fodder. The mere thought of them becoming mass murderers fills us with utter hatred. Therefore, we pledge to do our part to educate our children to refuse to participate in war."

The New York Conference of the Methodist Church, representing 75,000 peace-loving people, passed a resolution at its 151st annual meeting, urging the United States and the Soviet Union to conclude a "truce agreement," "stop the production of atomic bombs," and "seal up currently stored atomic bombs." The resolution suggests that a meeting of the four or five great powers be held to reach an agreement on a plan to control and ban atomic weapons. The resolution also endorsed "doing everything possible to encourage trade and other economic ties with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and to seek cooperation with the Soviet Union again to restore normal relations with Germany and Japan, and to restore their normal lives." The resolution called for "sincere joint planning with the Soviet Union for dealing with newly emerging countries, especially China." The resolution pointed out that the American Methodists "must urge our own government to do everything wisely and in good faith to restore normal relations with the Soviet Union, and encourage Congress, the State Department, and the President to formulate an American foreign policy consistent with world peace."

    美“母亲反战协会”呼吁和平
    【新华社十七日讯】塔斯社纽约十五日讯：美国“母亲反战协会”顷向新闻记者宣布：该团体在母亲节（按美国今年的母亲节是五月十四日），曾致函斯大林与杜鲁门，保证要尽最大的努力使第三次世界大战得以避免。该函由四十二州的二千三百名母亲签名，内称：“我们做母亲的，面临会毁灭人类的第三次世界大战的威胁，感到有责任在我们能力范围内采取最强有力的行动使这个战争得以避免。我们并不是让孩子们生到这个世界上来充当炮灰的。我们每念到他们会是大规模的屠杀者，便觉得痛恨之至。因此，我们保证要尽我们的力量，教育我们的子女，拒绝参加战争。”
    代表七万五千名爱好和平人士的新教美以美教会纽约会议，在第一百五十一届年会通过决议，敦促美国与苏联缔结“休止协定”，“停止制造原子弹”并“查封目前储存的原子弹”。该决议建议由四强或五强举行会议，以便就管制和禁用原子武器的计划取得协议。决议并赞同“尽一切可能鼓励对苏联及东欧的贸易和其他经济联系，并再度设法与苏联谋取合作，以恢复与德、日的平时关系，并恢复它们的正常生活”。决议要求进行“诚恳的与苏联共同计划对待新出现的国家，特别是中国”。决议指出，美国的美以美教徒“必须力促我们自己的政府竭尽一切明智善意的办法，来恢复与苏联的正常联系，并鼓励国会、国务院和总统制定符合于世界和平的美国外交政策。”
