　　Stable Prices and Increased Confidence in the Local Currency
　　Nationwide Surge in Deposits
　　End-of-April Balance More Than Triples Compared to End-of-February

    Our Special Correspondent Wang Jingran reports: Following the general stabilization of prices nationwide, confidence in the local currency has been increasingly consolidated, leading to a surge in deposits at People's Banks across the country. The balance at the end of April more than tripled compared to the end of February. From March 20th to April 10th, the National Financial Work Conference, based on the directive in the Government Council's Decision on Unified Financial and Economic Work that "National Banks should do their utmost to absorb public and private deposits," deployed and called upon National Banks nationwide to vigorously absorb deposits, guiding idle market funds towards production. Statistics as of the end of April show that the total amount of deposits absorbed by National Banks nationwide increased more than threefold compared to the balance at the end of February (the last month before the Unified Financial and Economic Work Decision). Among these, the East China (2.45 times) and Northwest (2.87 times) administrative regions saw increases exceeding threefold. Considering 26 major cities nationwide, the daily average balance in late April increased nearly fourfold compared to the average balance in late February. Fuzhou, Hangzhou, and Lanzhou experienced the most rapid increases, each exceeding fivefold or fourfold. Nanjing, Baoding, Xinxiang, Zhangjiakou, Chongqing, Taiyuan, Shanghai, Hankou, and Tianjin also increased more than threefold or about twofold. Shijiazhuang, Xi'an, Guiyang, Tangshan, Beijing, and Qingdao saw increases of more than 100%. Changsha, Guangzhou, and Zhengzhou increased by more than 50%, while only Datong, Guisui, Kaifeng, Jinan, and Nanchang saw increases of less than 50%. According to statistics from Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Hankou, Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Xi'an, the sources of deposits are as follows: commercial trade accounts for 23%, government agencies and organizations account for 26.6%, savings accounts for 12.6%, interbank deposits from financial institutions account for 12.4%, industry accounts for 8.3%, transportation accounts for 5.8%, cooperative enterprises account for 0.7%, individual economic undertakings account for 0.1%, and other sources account for 10.5%.
            Increased Proportion of Private Deposits

    Currently, deposits have different characteristics compared to the past: previously, the vast majority of deposits were from state-owned enterprises or government agencies, with very few private deposits. Now, the private sector has seen a significant increase. For example, the proportion of private deposits at the Zhejiang branch was only 23.87% in January but reached 29.4% in March. Private deposits at the Jiaodong branch increased more than threefold in March compared to February. In Tianjin branch, during the fifteen days in mid-to-late April, the private deposit portion accounted for more than 20% of the daily average deposit balance for twelve days (the portion converted to real value is not included). Compared with deposits from businesses, the private deposit portion in March was only equivalent to 84.3% of the business deposits, but in April, it increased to 107.7%. In Shanghai branch, the proportion of private deposits averaged over 30% in mid-to-late April, and even reached as high as 50% in March.
            Increasing Number of Fixed-Term Accounts

    Furthermore, due to the increasing stability of prices, People's Banks in various regions, in order to adapt to the shift in the masses' mentality from "valuing goods over currency" to "valuing currency over goods" that has persisted for many years, have not only continued to offer savings accounts indexed to real value, but have also introduced many different forms of fixed-term deposits. For example, the long-term, two-year fixed-term deposit offered by the Second Business Department of the Shanghai branch attracted 12 accounts in one week, totaling over 43 million yuan, creating an unprecedented event not seen in nearly twelve years. The two- to six-month fixed-term deposit offered by the savings department also received 17 accounts in one week, with a total value of over 100 million yuan. The number of fixed-term deposit accounts at the Zhengzhou City Bank increased from 12 in February to 83 in March, with the amount increasing sixteenfold. Of the 16.3 billion yuan increase in deposits at the Southern Jiangsu branch in March compared to February, fixed-term savings accounted for 8.3 billion yuan, more than half. This greatly demonstrates the increasing consolidation of the RMB's credit.

    To further facilitate depositors, major city banks nationwide successively introduced demand-deposit/time-deposit combination accounts in March and April. The main feature of this type of deposit is that depositors can enjoy both higher interest income (similar to fixed-term deposits) and the convenience of installment withdrawals (similar to demand deposits), without any restrictions on the target audience. According to incomplete data, branches in Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuxi, Nanjing, Qingdao, Jinan, Bengbu, Zhejiang, and other places have launched these accounts. Because this type of deposit is more convenient and beneficial for depositors, it was immediately widely embraced by the masses. On the day the Shanghai branch savings department launched the account, it received over 1,100 accounts, reaching over 7,000 accounts in ten days, with deposits totaling nearly 30 billion yuan. Even after the Bank of China and the four private-run new banks continued to offer the account, they still processed no less than 1,000 transactions per day. The Zhejiang branch's demand-deposit/time-deposit combination accounts allow withdrawals at any time after deposit, without any limit on the number of withdrawals, and the interest rate is adjusted dynamically, with interest still given for periods of less than seven days, with different rates based on the actual number of days deposited. From April 1st to April 15th, in half a month, there were 3,400 accounts, with a total deposit amount of approximately 3.8 billion yuan. In Wuxi, 784 accounts were received in the six days after the account was launched, with a total amount of 700 million yuan. In Tianjin, from the end of March to April 17th, there were 1,722 accounts, with a total amount of 8.7 billion yuan.

    The fundamental reason why National Banks have been able to attract a large number of deposits is mainly because the promulgation of the Unified Financial and Economic Work Decision has provided a strong guarantee for price stability nationwide. With the close cooperation of various departments and the banks' own efforts in vigorously implementing cash management, the twelve-year-long inflation has come to an end, and a situation of general price stability has emerged nationwide, with the RMB's credit greatly improving as a result. Therefore, the masses are happy to save money rather than scrambling to buy physical goods, which has led to a sharp increase in bank deposits in various regions. Of course, the improvements and increases in business operation methods made by banks in various regions to implement the directive to vigorously absorb public and private deposits have also rapidly facilitated the conversion of large amounts of cash into bank deposits.

### 物价稳定本币信用日高　全国各地存款激增　四月底余额较二月底增加两倍多

　　物价稳定本币信用日高
　　全国各地存款激增         
　　四月底余额较二月底增加两倍多
    本报特约通讯员王静然报道：全国物价普遍稳定后，本币信用益形巩固，各地人民银行存款激增，四月底余额较二月底增加两倍以上。三月二十日到四月十日全国金融工作会议，根据政府院统一财经工作决定中，“国家银行应尽量吸收公私存款”的指示，布置并号召全国国家银行大力吸收存款，引导市场游资投向生产。截至四月底统计：全国国家银行吸收存款总额较二月底（统一财经工作决定前最后一月）之余额增加两倍，其中超出两倍以上者有华东（二·四五倍）、西北（二·八七倍）两大行政区。如按全国二十六个主要城市来说，四月下旬每日平均余额较二月下旬平均余额增加几近三倍，尤以福州、杭州、兰州三地增加最为迅速，各在五倍多或四倍以上；南京、保定、新乡、张家口、重庆、太原、上海、汉口、天津九处亦增三倍多或二倍左右；增一倍以上的则有石家庄、西安、贵阳、唐山、北京、青岛等六处；增加百分之五十以上的有长沙、广州、郑州三处，不足百分之五十的只有大同、归绥、开封、济南、南昌等五处。存款来源的性质，根据沪、津、京、汉、穗、渝、西安七市统计，来自商业贸易方面者占百分之二十三，机关团体方面占百分之二十六点六，储蓄积存占百分之十二点六，金融同业转存占百分之十二点四，工业占百分之八点三，交通事业占百分之五点八，合作事业占百分之零点七，个体经济事业占百分之零点一，其他百分之十点五。
            私人存款比重增大
    目前存款还有与过去不同的特点：以往的存款绝大多数都是公营企业或机关，私人存款为数极少，现在则私人部分有了显著增加。如浙江分行一月份私人存款的比例尚是百分之二三点八七，到了三月份即达到百分之二九点四；胶东分行三月份私人存款较二月份增加二倍多。天津分行四月份中下旬内十五天每日平均存款余额中，有十二天私人存款部分均占百分之二十以上（折实部分尚不包括在内）；其私人存款部分如与行庄存款相比，三月份还只相当行庄百分之八四点三，四月份即增至百分之一○七点七。上海分行在四月中下旬，私人存款比重更平均达百分之三十以上，三月间，曾高至百分之五十。
            定期开户日益显多
    又由于物价的日趋稳定，各地人民银行为适应多年来群众“重货轻币”心理的转变，除了以往的折实储蓄之外，更增办了不少不同形式的定期存款。另如上海分行第二营业部开始举办的定期二年的长期存款，一周间开户十二笔，金额四千三百余万元，造成近十二年中未曾见过之罕事，合储部增办的二至六月的定期存款，一周内亦收存十七户，金额在一亿以上。郑州市行的定期存款由二月的十二户发展到三月的八十三户，金额增加了十六倍。苏南分行三月较二月增加的一百六十三亿存款中，定期储蓄一项即为八十三亿，占一半还多。这就大大显示了人民币的信用在日益巩固。
    为了进一步方便存户，全国主要城市银行在三、四月间均先后举办了定活两便存款，此种存款的主要特点是：存户既有较高利息收入（近似定期存款）又有分期支付（近似活期存款）之方便，对象不加限制。开办的行处，根据不完全的材料，即有上海、天津、无锡、南京、青岛、济南、蚌埠、浙江等各处，此种存款因为对存户方便与好处较多，因而立即为广大群众所普遍拥护。上海分行合储部开办的当天，即存入一千一百余户，十日间达到七千余户，存入金额近三百亿。及至中国银行与私营新四行续行开办后，每日仍收付不下千笔左右。浙江分行的定活两便存款，规定存入后即可随时支取，不限次数，利息机动调整，平均计算，未满七天仍给利息，按实存日数有等差分别；自四月一日到十五日半月中，存户有三千四百户，金额收入三十八亿许，无锡开办后六日间收存亦有七百八十四户，金额七亿元。天津自三月底至四月十七日存户一千七百二十二户，金额八十七亿。
    国家银行所以能吸收到大批存款的基本原因，主要是由于统一财经工作决定颁布后，给全国物价稳定以有力的保证。在各部门的密切配合与银行本身大力执行现金管理的努力下，结束了十二年来的通货膨胀，在全国范围内出现了物价普遍稳定的局面，人民币信用亦随之大大提高。因之，广大群众便乐于储存货币而不愿再争相竞购实物，这便造成了各地银行存款的急剧增加。当然，各地银行为贯彻大力吸收公私存款的指示，在业务经营方式上的改进和增多，亦迅速促使大量现金转为银行存款。
