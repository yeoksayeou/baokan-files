Pingyuan Province, Shouzhang Fourth District Committee Secretary Liu Zixin
Illegally Forced Marriage and Abandoned Work
Shouzhang County Committee Requests Disciplinary Action from Higher Authorities

Editor:
Recently, an inappropriate event occurred in Shouzhang County, Pingyuan Province, during the production and famine relief work, causing no small loss to the work. The course of events is as follows:

On the morning of March 6th, Comrade Liu Zixin, Secretary of the Fourth District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Shouzhang, was presiding over a joint meeting of village cadres. People's representatives and village government chairmen from all villages were present, and the Liaocheng Prefectural Commissioner's work team and the Pingyuan Provincial Production and Famine Relief Work Inspection Team were also in attendance. The main content of the meeting was to deploy various production loans for grain, emergency relief grain, support sideline production loans for grain, exchange coarse grains for fine grains, repair dikes, and weaving work. While District Secretary Liu Zixin was delivering a report, a matchmaker came to him and said, "The girl I introduced to you doesn't want to marry you anymore, and I can't do anything about it!..." The District Committee Secretary immediately left the meeting and went back to his room to sleep. The Deputy District Secretary, District Head, and Women's Federation Director all ran to his room to see him, leaving the joint meeting of village cadres in the district aside, which was then presided over only by Comrade Guo Guangjun of the Liaocheng Prefectural Commissioner's work team and Comrade Han Min of the Pingyuan Provincial Government Production and Disaster Relief Work Inspection Team. That evening, District Secretary Liu Zixin sent district cadres three times to Tianlou Village (where the girl lived) to persuade her, but to no avail. Not only did the girl's parents disagree, but the girl herself disagreed. It is understood that the reason she was unwilling to marry Liu Zixin was: Liu Zixin said he was twenty-eight years old, with no wife or children, but not long ago, her father visited Liu Zixin's home and found out that he had a wife and children and was thirty-five years old. Liu Zixin was furious when he heard the district cadre's report. All the branch committees raised objections to him, asking him to pay attention to the impact on the masses. He replied, "If you don't let me get married, I will commit suicide. I must marry her! Even if it's just for one night before divorcing!" On the morning of the 7th, Liu took a pistol to the girl's house in Tianlou to threaten and scare them. The girl's parents (middle peasants) had no choice and did not understand the government's marriage policy, so they had to agree. That morning, Liu hired a wedding sedan chair to go and forcibly marry her. The nineteen-year-old girl, late into the night, tearfully got into the wedding sedan chair without combing her hair or washing her face.

This matter had a bad impact on the masses, and everyone was very dissatisfied. After Liu got married, fearing that his wife would hang herself or jump into the well, he sent the wife of a district cadre to watch and monitor her constantly.

After Liu Zixin got married, he abandoned the overall leadership work of the district secretary, leaving the disaster victims behind, and followed his wife day and night. His wife was studying at Ge Di Kou in the district, and Liu followed her to work near that village, not going to other villages. During Liu's honeymoon days, all the district committees were busy accompanying Liu for his wedding celebrations, not going to the villages for two days, causing the district's production and famine relief work to fall into a state of drift. A total of 325,000 catties of various production loans for grain and emergency relief grain (including relief grain, exchange of coarse grains for fine grains, and production loans) were, due to the district secretary's abandonment of leadership, mostly occupied by village cadres and a few elements related to village cadres, losing the role of production self-rescue. Regarding this major issue, the district neither inspected and corrected it nor rectified the deviations through the People's Congress.

Now the disaster victims in the district are in urgent need of assistance, and it is hoped that this large batch of grain will be recovered and distributed to the hands of the real disaster victims, and that the leadership structure of the district will be improved, and that Liu Zixin will be given the necessary punishment.

Pingyuan Daily Reporter Shao Dazhang

Editor's Note: After receiving the letter from Comrade Shao Dazhang, a reporter from Pingyuan Daily, we immediately sent a letter to the Shouzhang County Committee for investigation. The situation described by the County Committee in its reply was basically the same as that described by Comrade Shao Dazhang, with only slight differences in some details, so it is not published here. The County Committee also attached "The County Committee's Understanding, Inspection, and Handling Opinions on this Issue," the full text of which is as follows.

Comrade Liu Zixin's behavior is a serious violation of the law. Especially at this tense moment of disaster relief, the Party and government at higher levels have provided huge loans for grain and emergency relief grain (320,000 catties of loans for grain in the Fourth District) to help the masses tide over the severe famine; however, Comrade Zixin was completely entangled in the issue of marriage and neglected this major political task, relaxed leadership, and caused deviations in the loan distribution in the seven administrative villages (village cadres taking more, absolute egalitarianism, etc.), causing great losses to the work. Furthermore, the marriage of Comrade Zixin itself violated the government's marriage policy. As the secretary of the District Committee, he should not have done this. This will of course have a very bad impact on the masses.

In the past, the County Committee always felt that the work in the Fourth District was successful and that Comrade Zixin was capable. Especially in last year's flood prevention work, Comrade Zixin led the masses day and night to carry out rescue work, as many as seventeen times before and after the opening of Zhang Shu'an's breach. Later, due to the large water flow, it was impossible to resist, and the breach finally opened, but the masses were very grateful to Comrade Zixin. Therefore, the County Committee only praised the Fourth District and did not criticize it, which made Comrade Zixin's pride and complacency rise, and the idea of enjoyment and corruption followed. The County Committee's accommodation and indulgence are the main root causes of this error. This exposes serious problems in the leadership of the County Committee.

After the incident, the County Committee immediately sent three organization cadres, including Li Xintan, to the woman's home to express their attitude and explain the government's laws and regulations, stating that if she agreed to a divorce, the marriage contract could be terminated. It also convened a meeting of cadres to explain that this behavior violated policy. The woman went to the government to file for divorce, and the government officially approved it (the divorce has now been granted). With the approval of the Prefectural Committee, the County Committee transferred Comrade Zixin to the county for reflection and requested the Prefectural Committee and the Provincial Committee to give him a punishment of dismissal from his post. Deputy Secretary Li Zhenhong did not resolutely stop him, and District Head Zhang Wenjie neither resolutely stopped him nor quickly reported to the county government. Comrade Liu Lanzhen, a member of the District Women's Federation, lied for Comrade Zixin before his engagement. These three people must conduct reflection and self-criticism in their thoughts.

### 平原省寿张四区分委书记刘子新　违法逼婚放弃工作　寿张县委呈请上级给以处分

　　平原省寿张四区分委书记刘子新
　　违法逼婚放弃工作 
    寿张县委呈请上级给以处分编辑同志：
    近来平原省寿张县在生产渡荒工作中，发生了一件不应有的事件，工作遭到了不小损失。事情的经过如下：
    三月六日上午，寿张四区中共区委书记刘子新同志正在主持各村村干联席会议，各村人民代表、村政府主席均已到齐，聊城专署工作组、平原省生产渡荒工作检查组均在座。会议主要内容是布置各种生产贷粮、急赈粮、扶植副业贷粮、以粗粮换细粮、复堤、纺织等工作。区书刘子新同志正在传达做报告时，一个媒婆走来对他说：“我给你介绍的那个姑娘不愿跟你结婚了，我也没法办！……”区委书记马上退出会场，回到自己寝室蒙头睡觉。副区书、区长、妇联主任均跑至他房子里去看他，把全区村干联席会扔在一旁，仅由聊城专署工作组郭光军同志和平原省府生产救灾工作检查组韩敏同志主持会议。当天晚上区书刘子新三次派区干前去田楼村（这位姑娘的住村）劝说，均无效果。不但女方父母不同意，姑娘本人也不同意。据了解，她不愿和刘子新结婚的原因是：刘子新说自己二十八岁，家没有妻，没有孩子，但不久以前她父亲到刘子新家访问，问出他有妻又有孩子，年龄是三十五岁。刘子新听到区干回报后大怒。所有分委都向他提意见，要他注意群众影响。他回答说：“你们如果不让我结婚，我就要自杀。我非和她结婚不可！那怕睡一夜再离婚也行！”七日早晨刘带匣枪到田楼女家威胁吓唬，女方父母（中农）走投无路，又不了解政府婚姻政策，只好被迫同意。当天上午刘雇了一顶花轿前去硬娶，十九岁的姑娘迟至天黑才饮泪吞声的上了花轿，头也没梳，脸也没洗。
    这件事在群众中影响恶劣，大家大为不满。刘结婚后，怕他的老婆上吊跳井，派了一个区干的老婆经常看守监视。
    刘子新结婚以后，即放弃了区书的全盘领导工作，把灾民丢在脑后，日夜跟着老婆。他老婆在该区葛堤口上学，刘即跟至该村附近工作，别村不去。在刘新婚的几天内，所有区委都为刘陪婚致欢，两天不下村工作，使该区生产渡荒工作陷入自流状态。各种生产贷粮和急赈粮共三十二万五千斤（包括救济粮、以粗换细、生产贷粮），由于区书放弃了领导，大部为村干及少数与村干有关系的分子所占有，失去了生产自救的作用。对此种重大问题，该区既不检查纠正，又不通过人代会纠偏。
    现该区灾民急待救助，希望将这大批粮食追回发至真正灾民之手，并改进该区领导机构，对刘子新应给以必要的处分。
                                    平原日报记者邵大章
    编者按：我们接到平原日报记者邵大章同志的来信后，即致函寿张县委调查。该县委复信所说情况与邵大章同志所叙述的基本上无大出入，仅在若干枝节上稍有不同，故不在此发表。该县委并附寄“县委会对这个问题的认识、检查和处理意见”，全文如下。
    刘子新同志这种行为是严重的犯法行为。特别在这紧张救灾关头，上级党和政府拿出了巨大贷粮和急赈粮（四区贷粮三十二万斤）来帮助群众渡过严重的灾荒；而子新同志完全纠缠在结婚的问题上，对这重大的政治任务，则加以忽视，放松领导，使七个行政村在贷粮上发生了偏向（村干多拿、绝对平均主义等偏向），工作受了很大损失。再拿子新同志结婚问题本身来讲，也是违犯政府的婚姻政策的。自己是区委书记，更不应如此。这在群众中当然要发生很坏的影响。
    县委过去一向感觉四区工作有成绩，子新同志有能力。特别是在去年防汛工作中，子新同志日夜领导群众进行抢险，仅在张书安开口处前后就有十七次之多，后因水势太大，无法抗拒，终于开口，但群众对子新同志非常感激。因此县委会对四区只有表扬没有批评，使子新同志骄傲自满情绪日渐高涨，享乐腐化思想随着产生。县委迁就姑息，是造成这次错误的主要根源。这暴露了县委领导上存在着严重的问题。
    事情发生后，县委马上派组织干事李心坦等三人到女方家里表明态度，说明政府法令，如同意离婚即可解除婚约，并召开干部会，说明这种行为是违犯政策的。女方到政府提出离婚，政府即正式批准（现已离婚）。县委在地委同意下，将子新同志调县反省，并呈请地委省委给以撤消工作处分。副书记李振红制止不坚决，区长张文杰既不坚决制止，又不很快报告县政府，县妇联委员刘兰贞同志在子新同志订婚前替他说了谎话，此三人必须在思想上作反省检讨。
                                             寿张县委会
                                      四月二十五日
