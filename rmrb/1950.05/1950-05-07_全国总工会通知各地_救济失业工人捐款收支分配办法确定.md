　　All-China Federation of Trade Unions Notifies All Regions: Measures for the Collection, Expenditure, and Distribution of Donations for Unemployed Workers Determined
[Our Newspaper Dispatch] The All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a notice on May 4 regarding the collection of donations to aid unemployed workers in Shanghai and throughout the country. Due to omissions and inappropriate aspects within the notice, a revised notice is now issued as follows:

Since the All-China Federation of Trade Unions issued a call to aid unemployed workers in Shanghai and throughout the country, workers and staff in factories, enterprises, government organs, organizations, schools across the nation, as well as commanders and fighters in all units of the People's Liberation Army, have enthusiastically responded and actively donated. A previous notice stated that the People's Bank of China would uniformly collect donations on behalf of the Federation. To avoid confusion in collection, the following notifications are made:

　　1. The People's Bank of China is the unified agency for collecting donations. All levels of trade union organizations, enterprises, government organs, schools, organizations, and military units should remit all donations for unemployed workers from their respective units to the local People's Bank of China for collection. Organizations that have already collected donations should also transfer the full amount to the local People's Bank.

　　2. Each donating unit should issue receipts to the donors of their units and announce the names of the donors, the amount of their donations, the total amount of donations from their unit, and the receipt obtained from the People's Bank after payment on the unit's wall newspaper or other publications.

　　3. The collection and reporting procedures agreed upon with the People's Bank are as follows:

　　A. When collecting donations, local People's Banks must fill out three-part receipts. The first part will be kept as a record. The second part will be kept by the donating unit. The third part will be transferred by the donating unit to the local provincial or municipal Federation of Trade Unions for verification and record-keeping.

　　B. Each provincial or municipal Federation of Trade Unions should compile a table of the donating units and the accurate figures received in each region and report it to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions every five days. Simultaneously, these figures should be published progressively in the local newspapers.

　　C. The Head Office of the People's Bank of China should, based on the reports from local branches, prepare a table of the donation collection situation every five days and notify the Finance Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

　　4. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, after verifying the donation notices from the Head Office of the People's Bank of China and the donation reports sent by the provincial and municipal Federations of Trade Unions, will progressively announce the total amount of donations in various regions in the newspapers.

　　5. The Head Office of the People's Bank of China will, based on the payment orders from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, notify local branches to make payments at any time.

　　6. Donations from various regions will be used to aid unemployed workers in each region according to the following distribution principles:

　　A. All donations from the Northeast region will be remitted to the Head Office of the People's Bank of China for the purpose of aiding unemployed workers in Shanghai.

　　B. Half of the donations from the five provinces of North China and Shandong Province will be used to aid unemployed workers in Shanghai, and half will be used to aid unemployed workers in major cities within the region.

　　C. All donations from East China, Central South China, Southwest, and Northwest regions will be used to aid unemployed workers in major cities within their respective regions.

　　D. Donations from various regions for the relief of unemployed workers in Shanghai should be turned over to the People's Bank. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions will then uniformly allocate these funds to the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions. The distribution methods for donations from various regions to aid unemployed workers in major cities within their respective regions will be determined by the Great Administrative Area Federations of Trade Unions or the All-China Federation of Trade Unions Offices, and payments will be made after being reported to and approved by this Federation.
