　　Tree Destruction Incident Occurs in Cao Dazhuang, Tong County
    Responsible District and Village Cadres Punished

    [Our Tong County Dispatch] A tree destruction incident occurred in Cao Dazhuang Village, Third District, Tong County, with over 10,000 trees felled. The responsible district and village cadres have been punished accordingly. One-third of Cao Dazhuang Village's land is sandy wasteland, unsuitable for cultivation. Through the villagers' years of afforestation efforts, there are now over 40,000 trees of various types. Last autumn, individual cases of tree theft occurred in the village. When the tree owners discovered this, they reported it to the village cadres, and the militia sent the thieves to the district. The district government did not handle the matter seriously, releasing the tree thieves after educating them, and instructing the village cadres to have the tree thieves frankly admit their mistakes and return the trees to their original owners. The village cadres did not implement this instruction, and the district did not conduct any checks. Subsequently, Wang Lianyou, the militia joint defense squad leader, Cao Lufeng, the instructor, and Cao Xinhui, a militiaman, conspired with other militiamen to steal trees again and transport them to Tong County for sale. Cao Qing, the village's Communist Party branch secretary and militia company commander, knew about this but did not stop it. After the tree theft incident was discovered in the village, the Communist Party branch held a meeting to discuss solutions. However, because Cao Qing shielded the tree-stealing militiamen, the meeting ended without any results. Later, when Wang Wenxing, the deputy minister of the district's armed forces department, inspected work in the district, a militiaman named Cao Zengxiang reported the tree theft incident to him, but it did not attract his attention. Twenty days later, the district Party committee discovered the matter and immediately sent cadres to handle it. After investigating the situation, it was decided that the tree-stealing militiamen should admit their mistakes to the masses. However, Cao Qing suppressed the matter and did not implement it. As a result, tree theft incidents continued to occur. In January of this year, when the village implemented land reform, 105 mu of landlord-owned tree-covered sandy wasteland were confiscated, but the property rights were not determined. In early March, after the land reform work team left, the district did not promptly address the remaining issues. These trees were left without anyone responsible for their care, and tree theft incidents occurred again. Every household with trees was panicked and indiscriminately felled trees, totaling over 10,000 trees. Only then did Yue Fusheng, the district Party committee secretary, personally go to the village to understand the situation and report it to the county Party committee. The county Party committee and county government dispatched key cadres to the village, along with the district Party committee secretary, to handle the matter. They convened Party member meetings, cadre meetings, and mass meetings, promoting the policy of protecting forests, pointing out the impropriety of indiscriminate tree felling, and determining the property rights of the sandy wasteland. They also investigated and listened to the opinions of the masses, arresting the main culprits of the tree theft, Wang Lianyou, Cao Xinhui, Wang Xikong, and others, and sending them to the county people's court. Simultaneously, under the leadership of cadres from the county Party committee and county government, the work of rectifying the branch and the village government was carried out. The government announced the removal of village cadres Cao Qing, Cao Lufeng, and others from their positions; within the Communist Party, Cao Qing was removed from his position as branch secretary and Cao Xinhui's candidacy for Party membership was revoked. Wang Xikong, Wang Lianyou, and Cao Xinhui were sentenced by the court to prison terms ranging from three to five years. Other villagers who had participated in tree theft or indiscriminate tree felling were also subjected to criticism and education. In addition to publicly apologizing to the masses for the error of failing to promptly investigate and address the tree theft incident, which resulted in losses to the masses, the county Party committee gave Yue Fusheng a demerit and the county government gave Deputy District Chief Hou Xiujun and Deputy Minister of the Armed Forces Department Wang Wenxing a demerit.

　　通县曹大庄发生破坏树林事件
    负责区村干部分别受处分
    【本报通县讯】通县三区曹大庄村发生破坏林木事件，被砍树木一万余株，负责的区、村干部已分别受处分。曹大庄村全村土地有三分之一为沙荒地，不适耕种，经群众多年来植树造林，共有各种树木四万余株。去年秋后，该村曾发生个别偷伐树木事件，被树主发觉，报告村干部，经民兵将偷犯送区。区政府未认真处理，将偷树人教育后放回，并指示村干部要偷树人坦白承认错误，并将树木退回原主。村干部未执行此项指示，区里亦未加检查。接着，该村民兵联防中队长王连有、指导员曹路峰、民兵曹新会等又商同其他民兵合伙偷树一次，运赴通县出卖。该村中共支部书记兼民兵中队长曹庆知道此事，未加制止。村内发现偷树事件后，中共支部曾开会讨论处理办法，因曹庆包庇偷树民兵，会议无结果而散。以后区武装部副部长王文兴在该区检查工作时，曾有民兵曹增祥向其报告偷树事件，但未引起他的注意。二十天后中共区委发觉此事，即派干部前往处理，查明情况，决定要偷树民兵向群众承认错误。但曹庆又压下此事未执行。于是偷树事件连续发生。今年一月该村实行土地改革时，没收了地主树林沙荒地一百零五亩，未确定产权。三月初土地改革工作组走后，区里未及时处理遗留的问题，这些树林无人负责看管，因之再度发生偷树事件。有树各户人人恐慌，亦滥伐树木，前后被砍一万余株。至此该区区委书记岳福生才到该村亲自了解情况，报告县委。经县委、县府派主要干部协同区委书记到该村处理。召开了党员会、干部会和群众大会，一面宣传保护林木政策，指出滥伐树木的不当，并确定了沙荒地的产权。一面调查了解，听取群众意见，将偷树的主要分子王连友、曹新会、王希孔等逮捕送县人民法院。同时由县委县府干部分别主持，进行了整顿支部和整顿村政权工作。由政府宣布撤销了村干部曹庆、曹路峰等的职务；中共党内亦宣布撤销曹庆支部书记职务并取销曹新会候补党员资格。王希孔、王连友、曹新会三人并被法院判处五年至三年的徒刑。其他曾参加偷树或滥伐树木的群众，亦经批评教育。区负责干部除公开向群众检讨了因未及时检查处理偷树事件而招致群众损失的错误外，县委并予岳福生以记过处分，县府亦予副区长侯秀俊、武装部副部长王文兴以记过处分。
