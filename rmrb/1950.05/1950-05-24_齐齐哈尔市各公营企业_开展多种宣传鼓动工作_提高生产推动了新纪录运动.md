Qiqihar News: With the continuous improvement and development of production, propaganda and mobilization work has been initially established and carried out in various state-owned enterprises in Qiqihar City. There are many ways of propaganda and mobilization created or adopted by various factories. There are more than 20 types in the city, including award conferences, flag award conferences, symposiums for advanced producers, photo comic strip exhibitions, technology exhibitions, bulletins, express reports, blackboard newspapers, red flag competitions, honor rolls, red and black lists, plays, broadcasts, daily production reports, comparison tables of quantity and quality, and recording merits on membership certificates. These methods have their own certain roles, and some have achieved good results and experience. For example, the blackboard newspaper of the Postal and Telecommunications Administration has widely established a communication organization, with rich content and beautiful form, divided into main and secondary publications, with comments from leaders and editor's notes, making the blackboard newspaper a powerful tool for guiding the overall work, reflecting production, and promoting production. The mobile slogans of the Nenjiang Match Company can be closely integrated with the production process, constantly changing content, and encouraging production to move forward continuously. In January, the Nenjiang Match Company did not carry out propaganda and mobilization work within the factory. The new record movement was silent because it could not find a direction, and the production plan was not completed. In February, the Propaganda and Mobilization Work Pilot Group organized by the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee and the Qiqihar Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China went to the factory to assist the Party branch and cooperate with the administration to carry out a large amount of propaganda and mobilization work, which stimulated the enthusiasm of the workers. With the joint efforts of all aspects of work, the factory's new record movement was universally launched. Now 69% of the factory's employees have created new records. Both output and quality have been improved, and defective products have been greatly reduced. Therefore, the first quarter's production task was overfulfilled.

Facts have proved that propaganda and mobilization work is one of the effective methods to improve production at present. However, some factories still do not pay attention to this work or are not good at using it. As a result, some factories have not properly carried out propaganda and mobilization work; some only have forms and become decorations; and even produce deviations: for example, the Nenjiang Iron Factory held the award conference not solemnly enough, making the award recipients feel "not glorious." The workers were very dissatisfied with this, which affected their production mood.

The Party Branch should uniformly lead propaganda and mobilization work

Organize various forces to form a propaganda and mobilization network

According to the opinions of the recent propaganda and mobilization work conference of state-owned factories in the city, the propaganda and mobilization work of each factory is best led by the Communist Party branch as an important political work method of the Party. The branch can organize a propaganda and mobilization work committee, absorbing the propaganda work leaders of the factory's trade union and the Communist Youth League to participate, unify various propaganda forces, and concretely lead, plan, and promote propaganda and mobilization work. Several groups can be set up under the committee to absorb party members, league members, and prestigious advanced workers to form a propaganda and mobilization network that extends to every corner of production. The content of propaganda and mobilization should include: (1) Educating the vast number of workers with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, improving their political awareness, and giving full play to their conscious labor enthusiasm. (2) Deeply publicizing the Party and the government's policies in state-owned enterprises. Publicizing and promoting management democratization, responsibility system, collective contracts, economic accounting system, and the current new record movement, etc. (3) Eliminating the ideological concerns of workers in production and establishing the idea of taking more labor as glory. (4) Grasping typical examples for commendation and criticism. Encouraging and promoting good work experiences and methods, and overcoming shortcomings in work.

When carrying out propaganda and mobilization work, it is necessary to closely integrate with the production process, sometimes even going ahead of production to guide production forward; it is necessary to adapt to the production characteristics of each factory and the characteristics of each production process, and adopt various methods without sticking to certain forms; it is necessary to determine the focus of propaganda and mobilization according to the key problems existing in production in each period, and have regular plans, arrangements, and summaries; at the same time, it is necessary to be good at uniting the masses, collecting mass opinions and ideological trends, and often discovering good and bad examples in production to carry out propaganda and mobilization.

　　齐齐哈尔市各公营企业
    开展多种宣传鼓动工作     
    提高生产推动了新纪录运动
    【本报齐齐哈尔讯】随着生产的不断提高和发展，齐齐哈尔市各公营企业中已初步建立和开展了宣传鼓动工作。各厂所创造或采用的宣传鼓动的方式很多，全市总计有奖励会、奖旗会、先进生产者座谈会、照片连环画展览会、技术展览会、通报、快报、黑板报、夺红旗、光荣榜、红黑榜、演剧、广播、生产日报表、数质量比较表、会员证上记功等二十多种。这些方式各有其一定的作用，有的已取得了很好的成绩和经验。如邮电管理局的黑板报，广泛建立了通讯组织，内容丰富，形式美观，分主刊、副刊、有首长评论、编者按语等，使黑板报成为指导全局工作、表现生产和推动生产的有力工具。嫩江火柴公司的流动标语，能紧紧结合生产进程，经常变换内容，鼓动生产不断前进。嫩江火柴公司，一月份厂内没有开展宣传鼓动工作，创新纪录运动因找不到方向陷于沉默，生产计划没有完成。二月份中共黑龙江省委与齐齐哈尔市委组织了宣传鼓动工作试点组，到该厂协助党支部，配合行政，大量展开了宣传鼓动工作，激发了职工的劳动热情，加上各方面工作的共同努力，使该厂新纪录运动普遍开展。现全厂职工已有百分之六十九创造了新纪录。产量、质量都提高了。废品大量减少。因而超额完成了第一季生产任务。
    事实证明，宣传鼓动工作是当前提高生产的有效方法之一。但有部分工厂还不重视此一工作或不善于运用此一工作，因之有的工厂宣传鼓动工作还没有好好搞起来；有的仅有形式，成为点缀品；甚至产生偏差：如嫩江铁工厂因奖励会开的不够隆重，使受奖者感受到“并不光荣”。职工对此甚为不满，反而影响了生产情绪。
    由支部统一领导宣传鼓动工作
    组织各种力量构成宣传鼓动网
    据该市最近举行的各公营工厂宣传鼓动工作会议的意见，各工厂的宣传鼓动工作最好由中共支部领导，作为党的重要的政治工作方法。支部可以组织宣传鼓动工作委员会，吸收厂内工会、青年团的宣传工作负责人参加，统一各种宣传力量，具体地领导、计划与推动宣传鼓动工作。委员会以下可设立若干小组，把党员、团员和有威信的先进职工吸收进来，形成宣传鼓动网，伸到生产中的各个角落里去。宣传鼓动的内容，应包括：（一）以马列主义毛泽东思想教育广大职工，提高其政治觉悟，发挥自觉的劳动热情。（二）深入宣传党与政府在公营企业中的政策。宣传推行管理民主化、责任制、集体合同、经济核算制和当前的创新纪录运动等。（三）解除职工在生产中的思想顾虑，建立以多劳动为光荣的思想。（四）抓住典型事例，进行表扬批评。鼓励与推广好的工作经验和方法，克服工作中的缺点。
    进行宣传鼓动工作时，要紧紧结合生产进程，有时并须走在生产前面，指导生产前进；要适应各厂生产特点和每个生产过程的特点，采用多种多样的方式，不必拘泥于一定的形式；要根据每个时期生产中存在的关键问题，确定宣传鼓动重心，要有定期的计划、布置和总结；同时，要善于团结群众，收集群众意见和思想动态，经常发现生产中好坏典型，以此进行宣传鼓动。
