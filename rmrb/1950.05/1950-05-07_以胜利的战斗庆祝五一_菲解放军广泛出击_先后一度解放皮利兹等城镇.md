　　Celebrating May Day with Victorious Battles
    Philippine People's Liberation Army Launches Extensive Offensives
    Briefly Liberating Towns Such as Pili

    [Xinhua News Agency, May 5th] The Philippine People's Liberation Army launched offensives in various parts of Central Luzon during the May Day holiday. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Manila: Strong Philippine People's Liberation Army forces simultaneously attacked the cities of Laur in Nueva Ecija Province (formerly translated as Ruwa Isiga Province) and Jagure in Pangasinan Province (formerly translated as Bangaxinnan Province) on May Day. They captured the mayor and police chief of Laur City. According to a United Press dispatch: Since May Day, the People's Liberation Army has also launched attacks in Bulacan Province (formerly translated as Bulacan Province) and Tarlac Province (formerly translated as Tarak Province) in Central Luzon.

    Prior to this, according to a United Press dispatch, the People's Liberation Army attacked Alabat Island off the east coast of Luzon on April 30th and briefly liberated Pili City, seizing a large amount of supplies. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch, the town of Kalawanan in Laguna Province (formerly translated as Laguna Province) was also briefly liberated on the evening of April 25th.

    The People's Liberation Army continues its attacks on towns surrounding Manila. According to a Reuters dispatch from Manila: Two hundred Philippine People's Liberation Army soldiers briefly liberated the town of Garawang, 40 miles south of Manila, on the evening of April 25th, and seized police weapons. The People's Liberation Army has also launched attacks in other areas north and south of Manila. The increasing threat posed by the People's Liberation Army to Manila has made the puppet President Quirino, who is hiding in Baguio, afraid to return to Manila, the capital city. According to Agence France-Presse: Quirino issued a statement on the 24th stating that he would "remain in Baguio indefinitely" because the commander of the constabulary, Ramos, had "advised" him that "Manila is not a safe place for the head of state."

　　以胜利的战斗庆祝五一
    菲解放军广泛出击
    先后一度解放皮利兹等城镇
    【新华社五日讯】菲律宾人民解放军在五一劳动节期间进攻中吕宋各地。据法新社马尼拉讯：强大的菲律宾解放军于五一劳动节同时进攻中吕宋的新怡西夏省（前译鲁瓦·伊西加省）的拉尔及蜂牙丝兰省（前译邦加新南省）的亚古勒两城。俘掳拉尔城的市长与警察长。另据合众社讯：自劳动节以来，解放军也曾在中吕宋的武拉干省（前译布拉坎省）及丹辘省（前译塔拉克省）出击。
    在此以前，据合众社讯，解放军曾于四月三十日攻入吕宋东岸外的阿拉巴特岛，并一度解放皮利兹城，缴获大量物资。另据法新社讯，内湖省（前译拉古纳省）卡老安镇亦曾于四月二十五日晚一度解放。
    解放军对马尼拉外围城镇继续进击。据路透社马尼拉讯：菲解放军二百名于四月二十五日晚一度解放马尼拉以南四十英里的加拉旺镇，并缴获警察武装。解放军在马尼拉以北和以南其他地区，亦曾发动攻击。解放军对马尼拉威胁的加强，使躲在碧瑶的傀儡总统季里诺不敢返回首都所在的马尼拉。据法新社讯：季里诺二十四日发表一项声明称：他将“无限期地停留在碧瑶”，因为警备队司令拉莫斯曾“劝告”他说：“对于国家元首来说，马尼拉不是一个安全的地方”。
