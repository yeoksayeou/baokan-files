　　Southern Soviet Union Prepares for Harvest
    Summer Crop Planting Exceeds Plan
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd] According to TASS, Moscow, 18th: In the southern regions of the Soviet Union, including Central Asia, Transcaucasia, Kuban, and Crimea, early-sown wheat and barley are rapidly maturing. Collective farms and Machine and Tractor Stations are preparing for the harvest. In Kuban, the harvest will begin two weeks earlier than usual. Combine harvester routes have been mapped out. Many combine drivers plan to harvest grain within twelve to fifteen days. Harvesting in Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan will also begin within fifteen days. In the Kuban region, the world-renowned winter wheat has grown to a height of eighty centimeters; in southern Ukraine, rye has already eared. In Moldavia, due to the rainy spring, a bumper grain harvest is expected.
    As of May 10th, twenty republics, border regions, and states in the Soviet Union have exceeded their planned targets for summer crop planting. Corn planting is nearing completion. The grasslands along the Volga River and the fields of the central regions of the Soviet Union are covered with lush green summer wheat.

　　苏联南部准备收获
    夏季作物播种超计划完成
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：苏联南部地区中亚细亚、外高加索、库班和克里米亚等地区，播种较早的小麦与大麦已迅速成熟，各集体农场和机器与拖拉机站正在准备收获工作。在库班，收获工作将比平时提早两周开始。联合机的车路已经划了出来。许多联合机驾驶员都计划在十二天到十五天之内收割谷物。土库曼和阿塞拜疆的收获工作亦将在十五天内开始。在库班流域，闻名世界的冬麦已经长到了八十公分的高度；在乌克兰南部，裸麦也已结穗。在摩尔达维亚，由于阳春多雨，谷物丰收有望。
    截至五月十日为止的调查，苏联已有二十个共和国边疆区和州超计划完成了夏季作物的播种。玉蜀黍的播种正接近完成。伏尔加沿岸的草原及苏联中部地区的田地，已经长遍了绿油油的夏麦。
