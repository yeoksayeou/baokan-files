　　To Facilitate the German People's Development of the National Economy
　　The Soviet Union Agrees to Reduce German Reparations

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th—TASS, Moscow, 16th: The Soviet government, at the request of the government of the German Democratic Republic, has agreed to reduce the remaining 50 percent of reparations owed to the Soviet Union, totaling $3,171 million. The exchange of telegrams between Germany and the Soviet Union regarding this matter is as follows:

　　Prime Minister Grotewohl of the German Democratic Republic sent a telegram to Marshal Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, on May 11, stating:

　　The Government of the German Democratic Republic, on May 11, 1950, reviewed the request from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany for a reduction in German reparations and believes that the proposal of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany is timely. The policy of consolidating the democratic system and strengthening peaceful economic construction, which has been followed by the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic, compels it to ask the Soviet Government to consider whether the Soviet Government deems it possible to reduce reparations, and to what extent.

　　Marshal Stalin replied to Prime Minister Grotewohl by telegram on May 15, stating:

　　The request made by the Government of the German Democratic Republic regarding the reduction of the amount of reparations to be paid by Germany has been studied by the Soviet Government.

　　The Soviet government is doing this in consideration of the fact that the German Democratic Republic is now consciously and regularly paying its reparations debt of $10 billion, and believes that the majority of this debt, valued at $3,658 million by the end of 1950, will also be paid off.

　　The Soviet Government hopes to facilitate the efforts of the German people to restore and develop the German national economy; and in view of the friendly relations established between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic, it has therefore decided, after reaching an agreement with the Government of the Republic of Poland, to reduce the outstanding balance of reparations by 50 percent, totaling $3,171 million.

　　In accordance with the statement made by the Soviet Government at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference in March 1947, stipulating a 20-year period for the payment of reparations, the Soviet Government has similarly decided to extend the period for Germany to pay the remaining reparations (totaling $3,171 million) in goods currently produced by 15 years, from the beginning of 1951 to the end of 1965.

　　Note: The Central Political Bureau of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany issued a statement on May 10, stating that the reparations obligations to the Soviet Union have been strictly fulfilled to date, and the working people of the German Democratic Republic have always regarded the reparations obligations as their responsibility. Considering that the foundation of peaceful democracy in the German Democratic Republic has been established, and to make future construction easier and improve the people's living standards, the Socialist Unity Party requests the government of the Republic to request the Soviet government to reduce the reparations obligations determined according to the Yalta and Potsdam conferences.

### 便利德国人民发展国民经济　苏联准减少德国赔偿费

　　便利德国人民发展国民经济
　　苏联准减少德国赔偿费
    【新华社十七日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十六日讯：苏联政府已应德意志民主共和国政府之请，准予削减对苏赔偿的余额百分之五十，合计三十一亿七千一百万美元。德苏双方关于此事的往来电文如下：
    德意志民主共和国政府总理格罗提渥于五月十一日致电苏联部长会议主席斯大林大元帅称：
    德意志民主共和国政府于一九五○年五月十一日审查了德国统一社会党所提减少德国赔偿费的请求，认为德国统一社会党的建议是合时的。德意志民主共和国临时政府所遵行的巩固民主制度与加强和平的经济建设的政策，使其不得不提请苏联政府研究：苏联政府是否认为减少赔偿费是可能的，并减少到何种程度。
    斯大林大元帅于五月十五日电复格罗提渥总理称：
    德意志民主共和国政府所提关于减少应由德国所支付的赔偿款额的请求，业已经过苏联政府的研究。
    苏联政府这样作，是考虑到：德意志民主共和国现正自觉地定期偿付其价值一百亿美元的赔偿债款，并认为：截至一九五○年底，价值三十六亿五千八百万美元的此项债款的大部，亦将偿清。
    苏联政府希望能便利德国人民为求恢复并发展德国国民经济所作的努力；并鉴于苏联与德意志民主共和国之间的友好关系业经建立，因此，在与波兰共和国政府取得协议后，决定将尚未偿清的赔偿余额，削减百分之五十，即合计三十一亿七千一百万美元。
    按照苏联政府于一九四七年三月莫斯科外长会议中所发表的将赔偿清付期限规定为二十年的声明，苏联政府业已照样决定，将德国以现时生产货物支付赔偿余额（合计三十一亿七千一百万美元）的期限延展十五年，自一九五一年年初起，直至一九六五年年底止。
    按：德国统一社会党中央政治局曾于五月十日发表声明，认为对苏联的赔偿义务迄今均在严格履行，德意志民主共和国劳动人民始终把赔偿义务看成是他们的责任。考虑到德意志民主共和国和平民主的基础已经建立，并为使今后的建设更加容易并改善人民的生活水平，统一社会党要求共和国政府请求苏联政府减低根据雅尔塔及波茨坦会议所确定的赔偿义务。
