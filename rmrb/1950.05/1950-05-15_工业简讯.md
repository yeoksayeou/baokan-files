    The entire staff of the Tianjin Postal District actively worked to develop business and overcome difficulties. With the close cooperation of the administration and the trade union, each bureau formulated specific plans and regularly checked progress. From January to March, the actual income was 11,815,400 jin of millet (plus some cash), exceeding the first quarter's production plan by 78.44%, approaching one-third of the total annual production target. It topped all postal districts within the customs area, and was commended by the General Administration with a circular. Based on the work of the first quarter, the bureau started a three-month production competition in May. (Xiao Liankui)
    The salt produced in various salt fields in western Liaoning in April reached the standard of first-class salt, containing 100% sodium chloride. In March of this year, the average result of the tests in the fields was 92.941% of sodium chloride, exceeding the puppet Manchukuo standard by 2.729%. In order to further improve the quality, the Xiangjiatun Salt Field researched and developed improved salt-making methods, and established a work plan and inspection system, which significantly improved the salt quality. Now, the new salt-making methods and work systems have been adopted by all salt fields in western Liaoning, so the salt produced generally reaches the standard of first-class salt.
