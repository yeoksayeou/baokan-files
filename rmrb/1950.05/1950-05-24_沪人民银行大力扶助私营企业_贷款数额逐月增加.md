Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 21st. The People's Bank of Shanghai Branch has used large amounts of loans to support private industrial and commercial enterprises, and has guided and supported private banks and businesses in directing concentrated floating capital into production. At the end of January this year, the loan balance of the Shanghai Branch was over 98.1 billion yuan; at the end of February, the balance was over 157.8 billion yuan; and at the end of March, the balance increased to over 244.4 billion yuan. After Shanghai's industry and commerce suffered severe difficulties due to the frenzied bombing by bandit aircraft on February 6, it was difficult for private banks and businesses to recover their loans on time. Subsequently, in order to prevent capital stagnation, private banks and businesses generally became more cautious about lending, even daring not to lend. The loan balance at the end of January was over 233.8 billion yuan; the balance at the end of February decreased to over 212.1 billion yuan; and the balance at the end of March decreased to over 176.2 billion yuan. In order to take care of the difficulties of private banks and businesses, the People's Bank handled re-mortgages, with a cumulative amount of over 503.4 billion yuan by the end of April, and a balance of over 21.4 billion yuan, directly supporting the loans of private banks and businesses and indirectly supporting private industry and commerce.
	In addition, since last year, the bank has mobilized the funds of private banks and businesses to invest in production through acceptance, amounting to nearly 50 billion yuan. The bank also used the re-discount method to support joint lending by joint public-private banks, with a total of over 24.5 billion yuan released by the end of April, and a balance of 13.185 billion yuan.
	According to April statistics, the private industrial and commercial enterprises supported by loans from the Shanghai Branch are mainly public utilities, accounting for 38 percent of all loans; the textile industry is second, accounting for 30 percent; and the financial industry is third, accounting for 20 percent.
	However, in the bank's lending work, due to an insufficiently clear understanding of the policy of maintaining production, it has not been able to fully exert its initiative. It has only selected loan recipients from the many private industrial and commercial enterprises that came to it with difficulties, and has not adopted a method of combining lending with supervision and internal rectification to promote the maintenance, recovery, and development of production in private industrial and commercial enterprises, with the result that some loans have become mere temporary relief. In addition, the bank has allowed some private industrial and commercial enterprises to use machinery, factory buildings, and land deeds as collateral in lending, which is not only inconsistent with the lending method, but also affects credit. Some private industrial and commercial enterprises have neglected subjective efforts and have not actively improved their operations, relying solely on loans from state banks. As a result, most of them are unable to repay the loans on time after obtaining them. This situation also affects the capital turnover of state banks.

　　沪人民银行大力扶助私营企业
    贷款数额逐月增加
    【新华社上海二十一日电】人民银行上海分行曾以大批贷款扶助私营工商业，并引导、支持私营行庄将集中的游资投向生产。今年一月底上海分行放款余额为九百八十一亿余元，二月底余额为一千五百七十八亿余元，三月底余额增加到二千四百四十四亿余元。上海市工商业在二月六日遭匪机疯狂轰炸后，困难严重，私营行庄的放款很难按时收回，嗣后私营行庄为防止资金呆滞，对放款大抵更为慎重，甚至不敢贷放，一月底放款余额二千三百三十八亿余元，二月底余额减至二千一百廿一亿余元，三月底余额减至一千七百六十二亿余元。人民银行为照顾私营行庄困难，曾办理转抵押，四月底累计达五千另三十四亿余元，余额二百十四亿余元，直接支持了私营行庄的放款，间接扶助了私营工商业。
    此外，自去年开始，该行通过承兑方式动员了私营行庄的资金投向生产，其数近五百亿元。该行又以转贴现办法，支持公私营联庄联合放款，四月份止共放出二百四十五亿余元，余额一百三十一亿八千五百万元。
    根据四月份的统计，上海分行所贷款扶植的私营工商业，以公用事业为最多，占全部放款的百分之三十八；纺织工业次之占百分之三十；金融业再次之，占百分之二十。
    但该行在放款工作中，由于对维持生产方针认识不够明确，尚未能充分发挥主动精神，只就找上门来的许多困难的私营工商业选择放款对象，又没有采取放款与监督及整顿内部相结合的办法，推动私营工商业维持、恢复与发展生产，致使有些放款成了单纯的临时救济。此外，该行在放款中曾经允许某些私营工商业以机器、厂房、地契等为抵押品，这种现象不仅与放款办法不合，而且还影响信用。有些私营工商业则忽视主观努力，没有积极改善经营，一味依赖国家银行贷款，因而在获得贷款以后，多数不能按期清还。这种情况，也影响了国家银行的资金周转。
