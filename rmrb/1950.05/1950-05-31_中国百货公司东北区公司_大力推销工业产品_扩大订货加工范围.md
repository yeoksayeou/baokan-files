　　China Department Store Northeast Branch
    Vigorously Promotes Industrial Products and Expands the Scope of Ordering and Processing
    [Shenyang News] According to the Northeast Daily News: In order to implement the policy of trade serving production, the Northeast Branch of the China Department Store Company is vigorously promoting industrial products to supply the daily needs of the broad masses of people. This year, the industrial productivity of Northeast China has gradually increased, and the proportion of industrial materials absorbed by the company has also increased accordingly. For example, in the first quarter of this year, national industrial products alone accounted for 57.6 percent of the company's total material sources, an increase of 23.9 percent compared with the fourth quarter of last year. Among them, in March, the products of the Ministry of Industry reached 62.9 percent of the source of materials.
    Due to the vigorous promotion of national industrial products by the department store system, the production raw materials of public and private enterprises have also been supplied. For example, in the first quarter of this year, the Shenyang Department Store Company sold 337 tons of asphalt (oil), of which state-owned enterprises accounted for 73.3 percent and local enterprises accounted for 26.7 percent. At the same time, it also supplied more than 25,000 files, 596 tool knives, and 399 drill bits to state-owned and public enterprises. 76 tons of Wax material and 42 tons of calcium carbide were sold to private enterprises. The company also put forward timely suggestions for improvement on some products with lower quality and specifications, so that the position of national industrial products in the market has gradually improved, and the sales channels of products have been expanded. For example, the rubber shoes produced by the Andong Rubber Factory were once considered inferior "Sunday shoes" by buyers in the first season of 1949. After specific improvement suggestions were put forward and improved by the factory, the "Progress Brand" was created, and it became a famous brand of rubber shoes in Northeast China.
    In order to meet the daily needs of the broad masses of the people, the Department Store District Company has organized the procurement and processing of department store groceries inside and outside the region. Taking the first quarter of 1950 as an example, it organized commodity sources such as clothing, shoes and hats, stationery, paper, western medicine, food groceries, etc., with a total value of more than 270 billion yuan (Northeast currency, same below). Due to the expansion of procurement and processing inside and outside the region, the business policy of commodity diversification has been basically realized.
    At present, the following problems still exist in the company's promotion of industrial products. First of all, the quantity of industrial products accepted is relatively large, but the promotion work has not yet been fully launched, so the inventory of industrial products in various provinces and cities is very large. Taking Shenyang City, which has a better promotion situation, as an example, the inventory of hardware at the end of March reached more than 10.9 billion yuan. The inventory of chemical raw materials is 13.3 billion yuan. Calculated by the total value of goods (industrial products) entering the Northeast in the first quarter and the total value of sales, the ratio is about 10 to 3. Secondly, there is a lack of planning in the distribution, resulting in some products being unsalable in some places and insufficient in others, and the needs of various places cannot be fully grasped. The third is the existence of blindness in accepting industrial products. For example, the contract for "benzene" was signed with Angang, but as a result, the planned quantity was exceeded by one time, which affected capital turnover and sales. The fourth is the quality, specifications, price, and variety of industrial products. Due to the fact that the cost of some products is higher than the market price and the quality is low, there is a phenomenon of sluggish sales. In addition to vigorously improving the shortcomings of the unit, the department store company is submitting relevant materials to relevant departments based on market needs, striving to improve the product quality, specifications, and varieties on the existing basis, and sell the country's industrial products in large quantities, and effectively realize the national commercial service for industrial construction.

　　中国百货公司东北区公司
    大力推销工业产品  扩大订货加工范围
    【沈阳讯】据东北日报消息：中国百货公司东北区公司为贯彻贸易为生产服务方针，大力推销工业产品，供应广大人民生活需要。今年东北工业生产力逐渐提高，该公司吸收工业物资的比重也随之增加。如今年第一季度中，该公司物资来源单国家工业产品即占总额的百分之五七·六，较去年第四季度上升了百分之二三·九。其中三月份物资来源中，工业部产品竟达百分之六二·九。
    由于百货系统大力推销国家工业产品，因此也就供给了公、私营企业的生产原料。如沈阳市百货公司今年第一季度即销售了沥青（油类）三百三十七吨，其中国营企业占百分之七十三点三；地方企业占百分之二十六点七。同时并供应了国公营企业错刀二万五千余把，工具刀五百九十六把，钻头三百九十九个。售与私营企业腊料子七十六吨，电石四十二吨。该公司对于部分质量规格较低的产品也及时提出了改进意见，使国家工业产品在市场中的地位逐渐提高，扩大了产品销路。如安东橡胶厂出品的胶鞋，一九四九年上季被购买者认为劣等货的“礼拜鞋”，经提出具体改进意见，由厂方加以改进，创为“进步牌”之后，进而成为东北胶鞋中的名牌货。
    百货区公司为了供应广大人民的生活需要，并组织了百货杂品的区内外采购与加工，以一九五○年第一季度为例，即组织了服装鞋帽、文具纸张、西药、食品杂货等商品来源总值二千七百余亿元（东北币、下同）。由于扩大区内外的采购加工，基本上实现了商品多样化的经营方针。
    目前该公司在推销工业产品中，尚存在下列问题。首先是接受工业产品的数量较大，而推销工作尚未全面展开，因此各省市工业产品库存数量很大。如以推销情况较好的沈阳市为例。三月末库存五金类达一百零九亿余元。化学原料库存一百三十三亿。以第一季度东北进关物资（工业品）总值与推销总值计算，约为十与三之比。其次是分拨中缺乏计划性，致使部分产品有的地方卖不了，有的地方不够卖，未能充分掌握各地需要。再次是接受工业产品中存在盲目性。如与鞍钢订立“苯”合同，结果因超过原计划数量一倍，影响了资金周转及推销。第四是工业产品的质量、规格、价格、品种问题。因有部分产品成本高于市价，以及质量低等造成滞销现象。现百货公司除大力改进本单位工作缺点外，正根据市场需要情况，将有关材料向有关部门提出，争取在现有的基础上将产品质量、规格、品种提高一步，把国家的工业产品大量推销出去，切实实现国家商业为工业建设服务的方针。
