Xinhua News Agency, 6th: "To make trains as accurate as clocks!" This is the battle cry of railway transportation personnel across the country during the "Train Punctuality Campaign Month" that began in mid-April. After a month of effort, the national railways have initially established a normal transportation order. During this period, the percentage of punctual departures for passenger trains was 99.4% in the Northeast, 99.7% in the Tianjin Railway Bureau, and 98% in the Jinan Railway Bureau. Other bureaus such as Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, Shanghai, and Hengyang all exceeded 82%. The percentage of punctual arrivals was 97% in the Northeast and 96% in the Tianjin Railway Bureau. In the latter half of April, the Northeast Railway and the Tianjin Railway Bureau each had four days where all passenger trains departed and arrived on time. On April 23rd, all passenger trains across the country achieved punctual departures. The percentage of punctual departures and arrivals for freight trains was above 95% in the Northeast and above 50% in other regions. Among these, all except the Shanghai Railway Bureau exceeded the specific requirements set by the Ministry of Railways in early April based on the different conditions of each bureau.

At the same time, the railway bureaus further rectified station order, allowing passengers to purchase tickets at any time. They also improved lighting, sanitation, and other facilities inside the trains. Some trains have been equipped with thermometers, libraries, and broadcasting equipment. Through express trains on long-distance routes such as Beijing-Manchuria and Beijing-Shanghai have added carriages for children's strollers and non-smoking passengers. Currently, railway transportation personnel across the country are continuing to fight with all their might against the four major shortcomings raised by passengers: darkness, crowding, dirtiness, and lateness (delays).

　　要使火车像钟表一样准确
    全国铁路正点运动收效  正常运输秩序初步建立
    【新华社六日讯】“要使火车像钟表一样准确!”这是全国铁路运输人员在四月中开始的“行车正点运动月”中的战斗口号。经过一个月来的努力，全国铁路已初步建立了正常的运输秩序。在此时期内，旅客列车正点出发者，东北为百分之九九点四、天津局为百分之九九点七、济南局为百分之九十八，余如太原、郑州、上海、衡阳各局则均在百分之八十二以上。正点到达者，东北为百分之九十七、天津局为百分之九十六。在四月份下半月，东北铁路和天津局旅客列车全部做到正点出发、到达的日数，各有四天。全国旅客列车并在四月二十三日均做到正点出发。货物列车正点出发、到达者，东北为百分之九十五以上，其他也在百分之五十以上。其中除上海局外，都超额完成了铁道部在四月初按各局不同条件而订出的具体要求。
    同时，各路局更进一步整顿了车站秩序，使旅客可以随时买到车票；并改进了列车内的照明、卫生等设备。有的列车已装置了寒暑表、书库和广播机。京满、京沪等长途直达快车加挂了携带儿童车和不吸烟旅客车。现全国铁路运输人员正继续以全力向旅客们所提出的黑、挤、脏、晚（点）等四大缺点作斗争。
