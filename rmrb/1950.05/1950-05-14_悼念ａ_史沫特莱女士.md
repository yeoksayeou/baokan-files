　　In Memory of Ms. A. Smedley
　　Mao Dun
    Hearing the terrible news of Ms. A. Smedley's death, I was stunned and unable to think for a long time.

    Something that you don't want but that insists on agitating you occupies my mind, refusing to leave.

    The death of a person or a friend can cause sorrow, indignation, regret, or a sense of confusion as if one will never be able to absolve years of guilt... I must admit that these multiple emotions converged in my heart when I heard that A. Smedley had been persecuted by the reactionary rulers of the United States and died in a London hospital.

    Events from more than twenty years ago surfaced from dusty memories.

    In the autumn of 1930, she and a friend visited my residence in Shanghai. This was our first meeting. That day, she asked me many sharp questions. Frankly, at that time, I was reserved towards her, maintaining a considerable distance.

    After Mr. Lu Xun moved to the Continental New Village, we met more frequently at Mr. Lu Xun's home. We also worked together on several matters, and I seemed to understand her better, which gradually increased my admiration for her. However, I also knew that she was not good at controlling her emotions. The year Mr. Lu Xun fell ill and passed away, she received my phone call and forcibly dragged an American doctor (a lung specialist) to Lu Xun's residence. After the diagnosis, she had just agreed with me not to let the patient know the severity of his condition, but she immediately covered her face and began to cry.

    In the spring of the year of the Pacific War, she had just come out of northern Shaanxi and was staying briefly in Hong Kong, preparing to go to the United States to write several books using the large amount of material she had collected in northern Shaanxi and the guerrilla areas. That day, she was very excited and talked a lot. Finally, she resolutely advised us (Xiao Hong, Duanmu Hongliang, and myself were present that day) to go to Singapore immediately, because the Japanese were about to attack Hong Kong (according to her estimation, no later than June of that year), Hong Kong could not be defended, but Singapore could be protected.

    This was the last time we met and talked. Afterwards, I only received a few short letters and several books, but none written by herself. I knew her health was not good. However, she still raised some donations in the United States for the welfare of Chinese writers.

    And today, just when the Chinese revolution has achieved a great victory, this international friend has unfortunately died. She could not personally witness the new atmosphere of the new China, or write a book. I imagine she died with regrets.

    In the most difficult years of the Chinese revolutionary struggle, A. Smedley was in China, and she was with us. When the whole world was still misled by the lies of the reactionaries, she was the first to tell the people of the world the truth about "Red China." The Chinese people and Chinese writers will not forget such a friend.

    And today, when the international reactionary group headed by American imperialism is provoking a new war against the people, the peace-loving people of the world must also regard A. Smedley's death as a great loss.

    We grieve, we are indignant, we mourn the loss of a passionate friend, a democratic fighter, and a progressive writer. May your soul rest in peace forever, Ms. A. Smedley!
                                       (May 12th)

　　悼念Ａ·史沫特莱女士
　　茅盾
    听到了Ａ·史沫特莱女士逝世的恶消息，我为之茫然，久久不能有所思。
    有一点什么使人不愿意它而它偏偏要来激动你的东西，盘踞在我的脑膜，驱之不去。
    一个人或者一个朋友的死，或使人悲痛，或使人愤慨，或使人惋惜，或使人惘惘然若将无以解除积年之负疚，……我不能不承认，正是这样多种的情绪辐凑在我胸头，当我听到了Ａ·史沫特莱为美国的反动统治者所迫害，病死在伦敦的医院里。
    二十多年的旧事在尘封的记忆中浮出来了。
    一九三○年秋，她和一个朋友到我在上海的寓居，这是第一次会面，那天，她就问了我许多尖锐的问题。坦白地说，那时我对她有保留，我对她保持了相当的距离。
    鲁迅先生移居在大陆新村以后，更经常的晤见，是在鲁迅先生家里。在几件事上，也曾共同工作，似乎了解得多些了，由此也对她渐更钦佩。但也知道她不善于控制自己的感情。鲁迅先生逝世那年初患病时，她接到我的电话就把一位美国医生（肺病专家）硬拉到鲁迅寓居，而在诊断以后，她刚刚和我约定不使病人知道病情的严重，她自己却马上掩面哭起来了。
    太平洋战争那年的春天，她刚从陕北出来，在香港小住，准备到美国去，把她在陕北以及游击区所搜集到的大批材料写成几本书。那天她很兴奋，谈得很多，最后，忽然坚决地劝告我们（那天在座有萧红、端木蕻良，和我）马上到新加坡去，因为日本人就要进攻香港（据她估计，不会迟至当年六月），香港不能守，而新加坡则是可以保得住的。
    这是最后一次的见面和谈话。以后就只接到过几封短信和几本书，却没有她自己的。知道她身体不好。可是她还为了中国作家的福利，在美国募集了一些捐款。
    而在今天，正当中国革命已经得到伟大胜利的时候，这一位国际友人竟然不幸死了，她不能亲见新中国的新气象，写一本书，想来她是死不瞑目的。
    在中国革命斗争最艰苦的年代，Ａ·史沫特莱是在中国，而且是和我们在一起的；在全世界还被反动派的谎言所迷蒙的时候，她是把“红色中国”的真相第一次告诉了世界人民的。中国人民和中国作家不会忘记这样的一个朋友。
    而在美帝国主义者为首的国际反动集团正在挑拨反人民的新战争的今天，世界的和平人民也要把Ａ·史沫特莱的逝世当作一个巨大的损失的。
    我们悲痛，愤慨，哀悼我们失去了一位热情的朋友，民主的战士和进步的作家。愿您的灵魂永远安息，Ａ·史沫特莱女士！
                                       （五月十二日）
