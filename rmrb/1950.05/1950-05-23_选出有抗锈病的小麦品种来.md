　　Select Wheat Varieties Resistant to Rust Disease
    Wang Shou
    In January and February of this year, wheat seedlings in some areas developed jaundice. Recently, the wheat jaundice epidemic has continued to spread in various regions. In Hebei Province, many areas face complete crop failure due to “stunted yellowing” (wheat turns yellow before heading, preventing it from producing ears). Similar situations exist in other regions. In light of the serious harm caused by jaundice, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government issued "Methods for Selecting Wheat Resistant to Rust Disease" on April 5th, calling on all localities to implement it, hoping that each region will discover disease-resistant varieties to reduce the serious damage to wheat production.
    Wheat jaundice is one of the major diseases of wheat, and there is currently no cure. Drug treatment and seed soaking are not significantly effective in preventing and controlling jaundice. The most effective method is to cultivate disease-resistant or relatively disease-resistant varieties. Each region has disease-resistant varieties, but some have already been discovered, while others have not. For example, Xiuzi wheat in the plains and Shandong, Yang wheat (Biyu wheat) in southwestern Henan, No. 72 wheat in central Hebei, Zhongnong No. 28 wheat and Jinda 4197 wheat in Nanjing, and Xuzhou 438 wheat in northern Jiangsu and northern Anhui are all relatively resistant to jaundice. We should quickly promote these varieties on a large scale, and at the same time, mobilize and rely on the masses to discover more wheat varieties recognized by the masses as resistant to jaundice, to replace ordinary varieties with weak disease resistance. This is one of the most important tasks in agricultural work at present.
    How can we find varieties with strong resistance to jaundice? The main methods are as follows:
    (1) Introduce foreign high-quality jaundice-resistant varieties. Yang wheat (also known as Biyu wheat or American Jade Peel) planted in Guanzhong, Shaanxi, Songxian, Henan, and Wuxi, Jiangsu, is a variety introduced from the United States with strong jaundice resistance and excellent yield and quality. Zhongnong No. 28 wheat is a high-quality jaundice-resistant variety from Italy, and Chuanfu wheat is a high-quality jaundice-resistant variety from Australia. These varieties are all worth promoting. However, when introducing foreign high-quality jaundice-resistant varieties, it is necessary to conduct acclimatization experiments, yield comparison experiments, and disease resistance experiments. Only when they are proven to be truly excellent can they be propagated and promoted.
    (2) Use the selection method to cultivate high-quality jaundice-resistant varieties. This method involves selecting disease-free single ears from wheat fields in jaundice-prone areas and taking them to the experimental field for testing. After inoculation, elimination, and yield comparison experiments, the varieties with strong disease resistance, high yield, and good quality are retained for propagation and promotion. For example, Dingxian No. 72 wheat, Xuzhou No. 438 wheat, and Jinda 4197 wheat are high-yielding varieties with strong jaundice resistance developed using this method. It is hoped that experimental fields, breeders, and plant pathologists will pay special attention to the cultivation of wheat varieties resistant to jaundice.
    (3) Use the hybridization method to cultivate high-quality varieties with strong jaundice resistance. Use varieties with strong disease resistance but low yield or unsuitable growth, and local varieties with high yield but weak disease resistance, and use artificial hybridization methods to cultivate high-quality varieties with strong disease resistance and high yield. This method is more complicated, but the results are significant. The North China Agricultural Science Research Institute, Nanjing Agricultural Science Research Institute, Department of Agronomy of Jinling University, Northwest Agricultural College Farm, and Northwest Farm are all working on this, and have achieved certain results. It is hoped that the institutions and comrades doing this work will give full consideration to the current urgent requirements, step up their work, and quickly increase the number of high-quality wheat varieties resistant to jaundice.
    There are many types of jaundice bacteria. A certain wheat variety can resist some of these bacteria, but may not be able to resist other bacteria. Moreover, the types of bacteria vary from region to region, the years in which they occur are also different, and the bacteria themselves are constantly mutating. It is relatively difficult to find a type of wheat that is absolutely free from jaundice. Therefore, it is good enough for each region to find a variety that can relatively resist the main local jaundice and reduce the damage caused by the disease. At the same time, it is hoped that various experimental research institutions will not be too demanding at present and cultivate varieties that are absolutely free from disease. If there are relatively disease-resistant varieties that can reduce losses, they can be promoted earlier.
    (4) At present, the most timely and effective method is to discover disease-resistant varieties through investigation, visits, and inspections in vast farmlands, and then propagate and promote them. For example, Xiuzi wheat, Hong wheat, and alkali-resistant wheat planted in the plains, Shandong, and Hebei are all jaundice-resistant varieties identified from ordinary farmers' crops. This method is very effective. If carried out in an organized and planned manner, many good varieties can be identified. Before wheat is harvested, all localities should earnestly carry out the selection of wheat resistant to jaundice and identify various disease-resistant and relatively disease-resistant varieties. In addition to mobilizing and organizing local people to adjust seeds themselves, it is hoped that seed companies, promotion agencies, and grain procurement agencies will cooperate with each other to grasp the seeds well so as to plan and promote their application when planting wheat this autumn.

　　选出有抗锈病的小麦品种来
    王绶
    今年一、二月间，有些地区的小麦幼苗即发生黄疸玻近来各地区小麦黄疸病灾害情形，续有发展。河北省就有许多地区的小麦，因为“禁口黄”（在小麦未出穗前发黄疸，以致不能抽穗）将致颗粒无收。其他地区也有类似的情形。鉴于黄疸的为害严重，中央人民政府农业部曾于四月五日发出“怎样选择抗锈病小麦办法”号召各地执行，希望各地区发现出抗病的品种，以减少小麦生产上严重的损害。
    小麦黄疸病，是小麦重要病害之一，在目前还没有治疗方法。药剂治疗与浸种，对于黄疸病的防治，都没有显著的成效。最有效的办法，就是栽培抗病的或比较有抗病能力的品种。各地区都有能抗病的品种，不过有的已经发现了，有的还没有发现。例如平原、山东的岫子麦，豫西南的洋麦（碧玉麦），冀中的七十二号麦，南京的中农二十八号麦，金大四一九七号麦，苏北、皖北的徐州四三八号麦，都是比较能抗黄疸的品种。我们应该赶快把这些品种大量推广，同时发动与依靠群众发现出更多的被群众所公认能抗黄疸的小麦品种，来代替普通抗病力不强的品种。这是目前农业工作上很重要的任务之一。
    怎样才能够找到抗黄疸病力强的品种呢？主要的不外以下几种办法：
    （一）引种外国抗黄疸的优良品种。陕西关中，河南嵩县，江苏无锡一带所种的洋麦（又名碧玉麦，亦名美国玉皮），是从美国引进来的品种，抗黄疸力很强，产量与品质都很好。中农二十八号麦是从意大利来的抗黄疸优良种，川福麦是从澳大利亚来的抗黄疸优良种。这些品种都值得推广。但在引进外国抗黄疸病优良品种时，须经过风土适应试验、产量比较试验与抗病试验，证明确属优良时始可繁殖推广。
    （二）用选种方法育成抗黄疸的优良品种，这方法是从黄疸病发生区之麦田内，选择不生病的单穗，拿到试验场作试验，经过接种淘汰与产量比较试验等手续，最后留下来抗病性强与产量高品质好的品种，即可加以繁殖推广。例如定县七十二号麦，徐州四三八号麦与金大四一九七号麦，就是用这方法育成的抗黄疸病力强产量高的品种。希望试验场、育种工作者及从事植物病理工作者，对于抗黄疸病小麦品种之育成，特别予以注意。
    （三）用杂交方法育成抗黄疸病力强的优良品种。利用抗病力强、产量低或生长不宜之品种，与产量高、抗病力弱的本地种，用人工杂交方法，育成抗病力强、产量高的优良品种。这个方法比较繁杂，但成效很大。华北农业科学研究所、南京农业科学研究所、金陵大学农艺系、西北农学院农场与西北农场等机关，都正在做这工作，并已取得一定的成果。希望做这工作的机关与工作同志，尽量照顾到目前迫切要求，加紧工作，从速增多抗黄疸病之优良小麦品种。
    黄疸病菌种类很多，某一种小麦品种能抗这几种病菌，未必能抗另外几种病菌。况且各地区病菌的种类不同，发生的年代也不同，病菌本身亦常常的在那里变异，要想找出一种小麦绝对不生黄疸病，是比较困难的。所以各地区能找到比较能抵抗当地的主要黄疸病，将病害的损失减轻就好。同时希望各试验研究机关，在目前不要苛求，育成绝对不生病的品种。如有相对的能抵抗病害减轻损失的品种，可提早推广出来。
    （四）在目前最能及时有效的办法是从广大的农田中经过调查、访问、考察，发现抗病的品种，加以繁殖推广。例如平原、山东、河北等地区所种的岫子麦、红麦、抗碱麦等品种，就是从普通农家种中检定出来的抗黄疸品种。这个方法很有效，如果有组织有计划的进行，一定能够检定出许多好品种来。各地在小麦未收割前，应切实进行选择抗黄疸病小麦工作，将各种抗病以及比较抗病的品种检定出来，除发动与组织当地群众自己调剂种子外，希望由种子公司、推广机构、征粮机构互相配合，很好的掌握种子，以备今秋种麦时有计划地推广应用。
