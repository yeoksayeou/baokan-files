Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 26th. After days of deliberation by 130 representatives from various sectors, including state-owned enterprises, private enterprise owners, and workers, the first East China Textile Conference has made important regulations on how the cotton textile industry in the entire region can move from maintenance to recovery and towards normal development. The conference was convened by the East China Textile Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Textile Industry of the Central People's Government, beginning on May 16th and ending on May 24th. The conference focused on discussing several major issues existing in the current cotton textile production in the East China region, such as unified raw cotton supply, solving product sales, adjusting labor-capital relations, and improving enterprise management, and formulated timely solutions.

　　The production capacity of the cotton textile industry in East China accounts for two-thirds of the country's total. The supply of raw cotton is a major issue. In 1947, 62 percent of the raw cotton used by factories in Shanghai relied on foreign countries. After liberation, under the difficult conditions of enemy blockade and bombing, the People's Government, relying on the support of various parts of the country, carried out the regulation of raw cotton, enabling 77 percent of the 3.6 million spindles in East China to operate. However, the unified and planned adjustment of raw cotton supply within the entire East China region, as decided by this conference, has never been done before. Taking Shanghai as an example, the current raw cotton stock of private factories in Shanghai accounts for about 35 percent of the monthly demand. There are still five months before the new cotton is available on the market, so unified planning is essential. During the conference, the East China Textile Administration Bureau, the East China Branch of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation, and other relevant departments, together with private factories, statistically analyzed the amount of public and private cotton stocks in various regions, the national cotton that could be purchased, and the foreign cotton that could be reliably imported, and formulated a unified plan, which has basically solved the raw cotton supply problem for the next five or six months.

　　The plan formulated by the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation to expand the contract spinning and weaving business is also an important measure to help private cotton textile enterprises solve the source of raw materials and product sales. This measure has been implemented in the past year and has achieved certain results. However, many manufacturers, accustomed to profiteering through hoarding, selling off, and speculation in rising prices, do not pay attention to the scientific management of industry, resulting in large organizations, poor product quality, and even causing some losses to the funds that state-owned enterprises use to support their production. To this end, this conference stipulated the following three conditions for future contract spinning and weaving: (1) Contracts must be fulfilled; (2) Factories accepting contract spinning and weaving should have a plan to reform their management. This plan must be negotiated by labor and capital and jointly signed to achieve cost-effective production, and then gradually restore and develop; (3) When applying for contract spinning and weaving, factories should report their equipment capacity and production status truthfully in order to specifically determine the quantity of contract spinning and weaving, and must not conceal or make false reports. In order to improve the unreasonable management methods in private enterprises in the past, the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Textile Industry Association formulated a draft of management standards with reference to the decisions of the National State-Owned Textile Conference, specifically stipulating the standards for material determination, quantity determination, quality determination, and staffing determination for each factory to refer to.

　　In terms of improving labor-capital relations, the biggest gain of this conference was the adoption of the reward and punishment regulations proposed by the capital side and the labor convention proposed by the labor side.

　　华东举行首届纺织会议
    统一调整原棉供应规定代纺代织条件
    【新华社上海二十六日电】经过公营企业、私营企业资方、工人等各方面一百三十位代表的多日集议，华东第一届纺织会议已对全区棉纺织业如何由维持到恢复和走向正常发展的问题作出重要规定。会议由中央人民政府纺织工业部华东纺织管理局召集，于五月十六日开始，二十四日结束。会议曾着重讨论了当前华东区棉纺织业生产中存在的若干主要问题，如统一原棉供应、解决产品销路、调整劳资关系、改善企业经营管理等，并拟制了适时的解决办法。
    华东棉纺织业的生产能力占全国的三分之二，原棉供应是一个大问题。一九四七年上海各厂所用原棉，百分之六十二是依赖国外；解放后，人民政府在敌人进行封锁轰炸的困难条件下，依靠国内各地的支援，进行了原棉的调剂，使华东三百六十余万枚纱锭中有百分之七十七能够运转。但像此次会议所决定的在全华东范围内统一地有计划地调整原棉供应，却是过去所没有过的。以上海为例，目前上海私营厂家存棉约占一个月需要量的百分之三十五；现距新棉上市尚有五个月，因此，统一筹划实为必需。会议中，华东纺织管理局、中国花纱布公司华东区公司等有关部门会同私营厂家统计了各地公私存棉量、可能收购的国棉和有把握进口的外棉，制定了统一的计划，已基本上解决了今后五六个月的原棉供应问题。
    花纱布公司拟定的扩大代纺代织业务的计划，也是帮助私营棉纺织业解决原料来源与产品销路的重要措施。过去一年来，这一措施即已实行，并取得一定效果。但不少厂家因习惯于在物价上涨中以囤积、抛售、投机倒把方法牟取暴利，因而不重视工业的科学经营，致使机构庞大、产品质劣，甚至使公营企业扶助其生产的资金，遭受若干损失。为此，这次会议规定了今后代纺代织的三个条件：（一）必须履行合同；（二）接受代纺代织的工厂应有改革经营的计划，这一计划须经劳资协商，共同签字以便做到保本生产，并进而逐步恢复和发展；（三）各厂申请代纺代织时应据实报告其设备能力及生产情况，以便具体确定代纺代织的数量，不得隐瞒虚报。为改进过去私营企业中不合理的经营方法，上海纺织业同业公会筹备会特参照全国公营纺织会议的决定，制定了经营标准草案，具体规定了定料、定量、定质、定员的标准，以供各厂参考。
    在改进劳资关系方面，这次会议最大收获是通过了资方所提的奖惩条例和劳方所提的劳动公约。
