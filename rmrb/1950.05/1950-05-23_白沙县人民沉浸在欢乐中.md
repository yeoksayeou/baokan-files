　　The People of Baisha County Are Immersed in Joy
　　Hai Yang
　　Baisha County, located in central Hainan, is an old revolutionary base area of the Qiongya Liberation Area. For more than ten years, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of Baisha have crushed countless enemy offensives and "mopping-up" operations. Before the People's Liberation Army crossed the sea for this battle, the people of Baisha enthusiastically launched movements to lend grain and join the army, preparing to welcome the main force. After the army landed, the people of the entire county welcomed their own troops with even greater enthusiasm.
　　Baisha's harvest this year was not good, but before the army crossed the sea, according to incomplete statistics, the county had already lent more than 2,700 *shi* of rice. Fanjia Township, which was often subjected to enemy ambushes and looting, lent out more than three times its planned quota despite the extremely difficult lives of the people, and won the county's red banner for supporting the front lines. Many farmers voluntarily lent all the grain stored in their homes. At the army recruitment meetings in various villages, young people enthusiastically signed up to join the army, quickly exceeding the originally planned number. The people of the First and Third Districts started spring plowing early, fearing that they would not be able to keep up with the army during the landing.
　　When the news that the vanguard troops had landed on the coast of Dan County on March 6th reached Baisha, the people of various villages were as busy as if they were celebrating a happy event. The villages were busy building arches, cleaning houses, and preparing beds. Hundreds of laborers from Baisha and Yasha townships, not even bothering to eat dinner, braved the rain and groped their way through the dark mountains to rush ahead to carry the wounded and transport ammunition.
　　Whenever the troops arrived in a village, the people there had already cleaned the houses and prepared boiled water and sugarcane, waiting for the soldiers. The soldiers also took out the biscuits they had brought and offered them to the landlords.
　　Comfort teams from Fulong, Shiqiu, Baisha, and Yasha villages flocked to the troops' station one after another. Many soldiers were moved to tears when they saw the piles of comfort goods sent by these poor people. The soldiers politely declined and returned the chickens and cows sent by the people to them. In order to return the cows, the soldiers and the residents often had long arguments. The peasant masses in one village insisted on slaughtering a cow to comfort the troops. The troops sent people to stop them, but they could not stop them. After arguing for three hours, the troops had to lie and say that they were about to move forward, which finally stopped the masses from slaughtering the cow.
　　On March 17th, the people of Baisha County held a grand meeting in a certain place to welcome the cross-sea People's Liberation Army. People from nearby villages waved red flags, beat gongs and drums, and brought comfort goods to participate. As soon as the troops arrived at the meeting place, the masses immediately swarmed into the ranks of the cross-sea troops and the Qiongya Column, stuffing bananas, peanuts, sugarcane, sugar cubes, tobacco leaves, and sweet potatoes into the hands of the soldiers. When the soldiers declined, they piled the comfort goods in front of the soldiers.
　　The Baisha County Chief, on behalf of the people of the entire county, presented the cross-sea troops with a red flag inscribed with the words "Saviors of the People." The soldiers excitedly shouted in unison, "We will repay the people of Baisha by winning more battles!" During the meeting, the folk dances of ethnic minorities and the *yangge* dances brought by the soldiers from the north exchanged the sincere feelings between the ethnic groups.
　　Although the troops were very tired after crossing the sea and fighting, they still helped the masses build the homes that had been burned and destroyed by the bandit army. The northern soldiers were not good at building thatched huts, and many people cut their fingers, but everyone still happily sang and worked non-stop. When the twelve new houses built by a certain company for the residents were completed, the residents gratefully said, "The Kuomintang came and burned the houses, and the People's Liberation Army came and built the houses!"

　　白沙县人民沉浸在欢乐中
    海阳
    海南中部的白沙县，是琼崖解放区的老根据地。十多年来，白沙人民在中国共产党领导下，粉碎了敌人无数次的进攻和“扫荡”。在这次人民解放军渡海作战前，白沙人民热烈展开借粮、参军运动，准备迎接大军；大军登陆后，全县人民更以高度的热情欢迎着自己的队伍。
    白沙今年的收成不好，可是在大军渡海前，据不完全统计：全县已借出米二千七百多石。经常受敌人夹攻、抢劫的番加乡，人民的生活虽然极为艰苦，仍然借出了超过预定额三倍的粮食，获得了全县的支援前线大红旗。很多农民都将家中的存粮全部自动借出。在各村的参军大会上，青年们热烈地报名参加，很快地就超出原订计划的数字。一、三区的人民为了怕赶不上在大军登陆时随军工作，都提早进行春耕。
    三月六日先锋部队在儋县海岸登陆的消息传到白沙后，各村人民像过喜事一样的忙碌着。各村庄忙着搭彩牌，打扫房屋，准备床铺。白沙、牙沙两乡的数百名民工，晚饭都顾不得吃，冒着雨摸着黑路，翻山越岭，急忙赶到前面去抬伤员，运弹药。
    部队每到一个村庄，那里的人民早就打扫好房屋，准备好开水、甘蔗，等待着战士们。战士们也拿出他们带来的饼干请房东们吃。
    阜龙、狮球、白沙、牙沙各村的慰劳队，络绎不绝地向部队驻地拥来。战士们看到这些贫苦人民送来的大堆慰劳品，很多人感动得流下泪来。战士们把人民送来的小鸡、牛都婉辞退还给他们。为了退牛，战士和居民群众往往发生长时间的争执。有一个村的农民群众硬要杀牛来慰劳部队，部队派人阻挡不住，争了三个钟头，最后部队只得撒谎说部队就要前进了，这才使群众停止杀牛。
    三月十七日白沙县人民在某地举行盛大的欢迎渡海解放军大会。附近几个村的人民挥着红旗，打起锣鼓，挑了慰劳品赶来参加。部队一到会场，全场群众马上一窝蜂地插进渡海部队和琼崖纵队的队伍中，把香蕉、花生、甘蔗、糖块、烟叶、蕃薯一股劲地向战士们手里塞。战士们辞谢时，他们就把慰劳品堆在战士们的面前。
    白沙县长代表全县人民送给渡海部队一面“人民救星”的红旗。战士们激动地齐声高呼：“我们用多打胜仗来报答白沙人民！”会中，少数民族同胞的土风舞和战士们从北方带来的秧歌舞，交流着民族间的真挚感情。
    部队虽然经过了渡海和作战已经很疲劳了，仍旧帮助群众建为匪军烧毁、破坏了的家园。北方战士们不善于盖茅屋，很多人划破了手指，但是大家仍然快乐地一面唱歌，一面不停地劳动着。某连为居民群众盖的十二间新屋落成时，居民们感激地说：“国民党来了烧屋，解放军来了盖屋！”
