Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 30th: Workers and staff at Tianjin East Station of the Tianjin Railway Bureau are enthusiastically engaged in a campaign to create new records in station transportation operations, with the aim of shortening vehicle stopping time and transfer time, reducing vehicle turnaround rate, and lowering transportation costs. Since May 7th, with the assistance of the Transportation Bureau of the Ministry of Railways and the Tianjin Railway Bureau, the station has begun experimenting with various station transportation operation standards. During the experimentation process, due to the high enthusiasm of workers and staff, new records in station transportation operations have been continuously created. On May 13th, the Youth Team shunting group set a new record of two minutes and sixteen seconds per shunting (the unit of calculation for shunting operations). On May 19th, they further set a new national record of one minute and twenty-five seconds per shunting. The train formation and dismantling time and the car number recording time have also been greatly shortened due to simplified work procedures and improved work organization, enabling the vehicle dwell time at the station (including loading and unloading time) to be shortened from an average of 19.4 hours to 11.6 hours (highest record on May 28th), which is more than 30% less than the 17 hours set by the Ministry of Railways. The vehicle transfer time (including registering car numbers, bumping cars, uncoupling locomotives, counting goods, and testing brakes, etc.) also created a highest record of 4.3 hours on May 23rd. Shortening vehicle stopping time and transfer time is a decisive factor for the people's railways to shorten vehicle turnaround rate and improve transportation efficiency. To this end, the Tianjin Railway Bureau has established a special working group at Tianjin East Station to further advance the movement to create new records in station operations.

    连创运转作业新纪录           
    车辆停站及中转时间均缩短
    【新华社天津三十日电】天津路局天津东站正热烈进行创造车站运转作业新纪录运动，以缩短车辆停站时间及中转时间，缩短车辆周转率，减低运输成本。该站自五月七日开始，即在铁道部运输局及天津路局帮助下开始试验各种车站运转作业标准。在试验的过程中，由于工人和职员的高度热情，不断创造出车站运转作业的新纪录。五月十三日该站青年号调车组创造每钩（调车作业计算单位）二分十六秒新纪录，十九日再创造每钩一分二十五秒的全国最高纪录。列车的编列及解体时间和抄车号时间等也因简化工作手续及改进工作组织而大为缩短，使车辆在站停留时间（包括装卸货物的时间）由平均十九点四小时缩短为十一点六小时（五月二十八日最高纪录），比铁道部订的十七小时减少百分之三十以上。车辆中转时间（包括登记车号、杠车、甩挂车头、点货、试风等）也于五月二十三日创造了四点三小时的最高纪录。缩短车辆停站时间及中转时间乃是人民铁路缩短车辆周转率提高运输效能的决定因素。为此天津路局已在天津东站成立特别工作组，以便将创造车站作业新纪录运动更向前推进一步。
