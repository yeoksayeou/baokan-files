Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 19th: General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese Army, issued a message on the occasion of President Ho Chi Minh's 60th birthday, calling on the Vietnamese army and people's armed forces to complete preparations for the general counter-offensive. The message stated: Today is President Ho Chi Minh's 60th birthday. The characteristic of this year of President Ho Chi Minh's 60th birthday is that Vietnam has been recognized by the Soviet Union, China, and various People's Democratic countries; another characteristic is that the Vietnamese military and civilians are currently doing their utmost to launch a counter-offensive as soon as possible. It is thanks to President Ho Chi Minh's wise leadership that we have won such a great victory. We must celebrate his birthday with a very serious and realistic attitude. All officers and soldiers of the Vietnamese army must learn from President Ho Chi Minh, examine their own ways of thinking, their own actions and qualities. They must emulate President Ho Chi Minh's spirit, putting the interests of the people before their own personal interests, and display the virtues of diligence, thrift, integrity, and impartiality, all of which he fully embodies. You must also study tactics and technology, and strive to build a strong field army and a strong reserve army to counter the various attempts of the French colonialists and international reactionaries to save themselves from collapse. The year of President Ho Chi Minh's 60th birthday will also see further victories for the Vietnamese people and the democratic forces in Southeast Asia. All comrade soldiers! Let us learn from Ho Chi Minh's example and thoroughly implement his orders.

    【新华社二十日讯】越南通讯社北越十九日电：越军总司令武元甲于胡志明主席六十寿辰发表文告，号召越军及人民武装部队完成总反攻的准备。文告称：今天是胡志明主席的六十寿辰。胡志明主席六十寿辰这一年的特点是越南已为苏联、中国、及各人民民主国家所承认；另一特点，是越南军民目前正在竭尽全力，以便早日发动反攻。凭着胡志明主席明智的领导，我们才赢得这样伟大的胜利。我们必须以非常严肃而现实的态度来庆祝他的寿辰。越南军队的全体官兵们必须向胡志明主席学习，检讨他们自己的思想方法，他们自己的行动与品质。他们必须仿效胡志明主席的精神，把人民利益放在个人利益的前面，发挥勤苦、俭朴、廉洁、公正的美德，这些都是他所充分体现了的。你们还必须学习战术与技术，努力建立一支强有力的野战军与强大的后备军，以对付法国殖民者与国际反动派们想使他们自己免于崩溃的各种企图。胡志明主席六十寿辰这一年，还会看到越南人民与东南亚的民主势力取得更进一步的胜利。全体的士兵同志们！让我们学习胡志明的榜样，彻底执行他的命令。
