　　Celebrating the Liberation of the Zhoushan Islands

　　Following the landing of the People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army on Hainan Island, the Third Field Army's Zhoushan Front troops landed on Zhoushan Island on the afternoon of the 16th of this month, liberating Dinghai County seat. They pressed forward victoriously, continuing to liberate Daishan, Changtu, Putuo, Zhujiajian Islands, and others. Within two days and nights, the entire Zhoushan Islands were completely liberated. This is another great victory for our powerful People's Liberation Army in naval operations. We extend our respects to the heroic frontline troops of the People's Liberation Army who liberated the Zhoushan Islands! We extend our congratulations to the compatriots of the Zhoushan Islands who have long been ravaged and oppressed by the Kuomintang bandit gangs and are now liberated!

　　The great victory of the liberation of the Zhoushan Islands once again proves that the powerful People's Liberation Army is not only invincible on the mainland but also adept at naval operations. This proves that the ocean cannot stop the advance of our heroic People's Liberation Army. The dream of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit remnants to prolong their lives by relying on the islands will be completely shattered.

　　The liberation of the Zhoushan Islands has shattered the Chiang Kai-shek bandit's plan to use Zhoushan as a base to blockade, bomb, and harass Shanghai and the Zhejiang coast. This will gradually restore maritime traffic to and from Shanghai, providing a favorable condition for the improvement of Shanghai's economy. After the liberation of the Zhoushan Islands, the few small islands occupied by the enemy along the coast will be quickly liberated, and coastal security will be easier to consolidate than before. The enemy trapped in Taiwan is approaching its doomsday even faster. Comrades throughout the country, the war is coming closer to a victorious end. Let us make the final effort to liberate Taiwan and Tibet!

　　庆祝舟山群岛解放
    在人民解放军第四野战军登陆海南岛之后，第三野战军舟山前线部队已于本月十六日下午登陆舟山本岛，解放定海县城，乘胜进军，继续解放岱山、长涂山、普陀山、朱家尖诸岛。在两昼夜间，完全解放了舟山群岛。这是我强大的人民解放军海上作战的再次伟大胜利。我们谨向解放舟山群岛的英勇解放军前线部队致敬！谨向久被国民党匪帮蹂躏压迫而今获得解放的舟山群岛的同胞致贺！
    解放舟山群岛的伟大胜利，又一次证明了强大的人民解放军不但在大陆上是攻无不克、战无不胜的，而且也是善于海上作战的。这证明海洋并不能阻挡我英雄的人民解放军的前进。蒋匪残余企图凭借海岛苟延残喘的梦想必将完全破灭。
    舟山群岛的解放，粉碎了蒋匪以舟山为基地对上海及浙江沿海的封锁、轰炸和骚扰的计划。这将使上海对外的海上交通逐步恢复，使上海经济的好转得到一个有利条件。舟山群岛解放以后，沿海敌人所占据的少数小岛将迅速解放，沿海治安亦将较前易于巩固。困守台湾的敌人，末日更加迫近了。全国的同胞们，战争已经更加接近于胜利的结束，让我们为解放台湾和西藏，作最后的努力吧！
