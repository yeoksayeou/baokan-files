Xinhua News Agency, May 24th Dispatch from Moscow: On April 30th, the Soviet Komsomolskaya Pravda published an article entitled "In New China" by Qiqitkina, Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the International Department of Pravda, from the first to the fourth pages. The author had visited China last year when the Asian Women's Representative Conference was held. The newspaper also published seventeen photographs about New China, with the four photographs on the first page being: the military parade in front of Tiananmen Square in Beijing, the mass rally at the sports field outside Qianmen in Beijing, the parade shouting slogans, and the flag-raising ceremony. In addition, there were guerrillas on small boats, workers at the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant smelting iron, peasants beaming with land certificates, a Yangko team, students studying, and children saluting, etc.

Qiqitkina wrote: "Citizens of the People's Republic of China enjoy all democratic rights and freedoms. For the first time in their national history, women have obtained equal rights with men in all aspects of life and activity. Complete equality of all nationalities has been established. The Chinese people are fighting to become masters of their country, so that Chinese workers can work not for imperialism, but for themselves and their motherland, and so that Chinese peasants can obtain the land they desire and their children can go to school. Because the people are following the Chinese Communist Party and its leader Mao Zedong, they have won victory in the struggle."

Qiqitkina listed facts and pictures to illustrate the situation of Chinese workers and peasants becoming masters of the country. She said: The Chinese people, like flowers facing the sun, are heading towards education and culture.

    《在新中国》
    【新华社二十四日讯】莫斯科航讯：四月三十日，苏联共青真理报从第一版到第四版刊载了真理报国际部副主编齐契特金娜的《在新中国》一文。作者曾在去年亚洲妇女代表会议开会之时到过中国。该报同时刊出有关新中国的照片十七幅，登在第一版的四幅照片为：北京天安门前的阅兵，北京前门外运动场上的群众大会，游行队伍的高呼口号和升旗式。此外，有乘着小船的游击队，在炼铁中的鞍山钢铁厂工人，拿着土地证的笑逐颜开的农民，秧歌队，在学习的学生和举行敬礼的儿童等等。
    齐契特金娜写道：“中华人民共和国的公民，享受着一切民主权利和自由。妇女们在本国历史上第一次获得了在生活和活动各方面跟男子平等的权利。各民族的完全平等已经确立了。中国人民斗争是为了要成为国家的主人，是为了使中国工人能够不是为帝国主义工作，而是为自己、为自己的祖国工作，也是为了使中国农民获得渴望的土地，使他们的儿童能够进学校。因为人民是跟着中国共产党及其领袖毛泽东走，所以在斗争中得到了胜利。”
    齐契特金娜列举事实和图片说明中国工人农民成为国家主人后的情形，她说：中国人民像向着太阳的花朵一样地在向着教育，向着文化。
