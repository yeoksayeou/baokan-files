　　Cooperative Warehouses Promote Rural Native Products
　　Material Exchange Between Urban and Rural Areas in North China Tends Towards Equilibrium

　　[Our newspaper's dispatch] In the past two months, cooperative warehouses in North China have vigorously promoted rural native products, bringing material exchange between urban and rural areas closer to equilibrium. In March and April, the total value of materials traded through the warehouses reached 73.7 billion yuan, with goods flowing from rural to urban areas accounting for 51 percent, mainly native products and grain; goods flowing from urban to rural areas accounted for 49 percent, mainly fertilizers and daily necessities. From September to the end of December last year, the total value of native products sold by the warehouses only accounted for 16 percent of the total transaction value. However, after active efforts to promote sales, the inflow of native products to cities has increased month by month, and now the exchange of industrial and agricultural products is finally showing a balanced development trend.

　　In addition, in order to widely open up sales channels for native products, the export business of the warehouses is also developing rapidly. In the past two months, a total of 900,000 pounds of native products have been processed for export. The warehouses are now studying plans to test-market native products that are not easily sold in rural areas abroad.

　　合作货栈推销农村土产
    华北城乡物资交流趋向平衡
    【本报讯】华北合作货栈，近两月来大力推销农村土产，使城乡物资交流趋向平衡。三、四两月份经该栈成交物资总值达七百三十七亿元，其中由农村流入城市者占百分之五十一，以土产、粮食为大宗；由城市流向农村者占百分之四十九，以肥料、日用品为大宗。该栈从去年九月至十二月底，推销土产总额只占交易总额的百分之十六，后经积极努力推销，致流入城市土产逐月增加，至今终使工农业产品的交换呈平衡发展趋势。
    又该栈为广泛给土产打开销路，出口业务亦日益发展，近两个月来共加工出口土产九十万磅。现该栈正研究拟将在农村不易推销之土产向国外试销。
