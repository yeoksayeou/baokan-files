Xinhua News Agency, 30th: Since the implementation of the adjustment of transport order in the national railways in April, there has been great progress in punctuality and passenger service. The unreasonable phenomena of darkness, crowding, slowness, and dirtiness on passenger trains have been basically eliminated.

At the beginning of April, the Ministry of Railways instructed all bureaus to actively strive, under the difficult conditions of incomplete equipment and insufficient tool quality, to achieve a normal state of 100% on-time departure and 90% on-time arrival for passenger trains. The vast number of railway workers and staff immediately launched a competition upsurge. In April, the Northeast General Bureau and the Tianjin Bureau achieved over 99% on-time departure for passenger trains, and the on-time arrival also exceeded the 90% standard. The percentage of trains on time has risen in all bureaus. Among them, the on-time departure of passenger trains at the Hengyang Bureau increased by 30.2%, and the on-time arrival increased by 30.1%. In the first half of May, the on-time departure of passenger trains at the Shanghai Bureau reached 99%, and the on-time arrival reached 94%, greatly exceeding the achievements of April.

On the major railway lines across the country, most passenger cars have been equipped with lighting, water supply, sanitation, and other facilities, and it is guaranteed that passengers will have seats when they board the train. Some trains also provide passengers with books and newspapers, deliver letters for passengers, report current news and introduce local customs along the route. Passenger cars in the Northeast are also equipped with seasonal medicines and stretchers and beds for temporary patients. The attitude of train attendants towards passengers has largely been modest and responsible. However, on the other hand, there are still many delays on the railway due to locomotive failures and line failures. The cleaning of some passenger cars is still not done well enough. Some substitute tarpaulin cars on the western section of Longhai Railway and the Tongpu Railway still lack lighting and toilets. These shortcomings still need to be overcome.

　　铁路运输秩序大改进
    各局正点百分比都已上升     
    客车上的不合理现象基本消灭
    【新华社三十日讯】全国铁路自四月份施行调整运输秩序以来，在正点运行和服务旅客方面均有很大进步，客车的黑、挤、慢、脏等不合理现象均已基本上消灭。
    四月初，铁道部责成各局要在设备不全、工具质量不够完好的困难条件下积极努力，作到客车出发正点百分之百，到达正点百分之九十的正常状态。广大铁路工人和职员，当即开展了竞赛热潮。四月份，东北总局和天津局的客车出发正点都达到百分之九十九以上，到达正点并超过了百分之九十的标准。各局正点百分比都已上升。其中衡阳局客车出发正点上升百分之三十点二，到达正点上升百分之三十点一。五月上半月中，上海局客车出发正点已达到百分之九十九，到达正点达到百分之九十四，大大超过了四月份的成绩。
    在全国各主要线路上的客车，大部已装上照明、供水、清洁卫生等各种设备，并保证了客人上车就有座位。有的车上还供给旅客书报，为旅客递送信件，向旅客报告时事新闻和介绍沿线风俗习惯。东北的客车上并备有时令药品和为临时伤病员用的担架和卧床。行车乘务员对待旅客的态度大部都作到了谦虚负责。但是，另一方面，铁路上由于机车故障、线路故障而造成的晚点，仍然不少。有些客车清扫工作还做得很不够。陇海西段和同蒲线有些代用篷车还是无灯光和厕所。这些缺点尚待继续加以克服。
