Shijiazhuang New China Sugar Factory Construction Project Suffers Serious Waste

[Our Shijiazhuang Dispatch] (Reporter Zhang Rong'an reports): Since the construction of the Shijiazhuang New China Sugar Factory began in June last year, serious waste phenomena such as repeated rework and material wastage have occurred. This is the result of the factory's administrative leaders lacking the concept of relying on workers to manage the factory and lacking an enterprise-oriented management ideology. The factory installed a total of 109 machines in 45 categories, and all of them, large and small, had to be reworked. According to the books, these machines wasted more than 33,000 jin of millet due to rework and material wastage. However, according to the reporter's understanding, the actual number is far more than this. The factory manufactured eight "centrifugal machines" last year, and three of them broke down shortly after being put into use, each worth 15,000 jin of millet. The factory's largest sugar-making machine, the "immersion tank," was poorly manufactured and installed, and it repeatedly broke down during use. On one occasion, production suffered a major loss due to a four-day and four-night shutdown for machine repair. The factory's entire machine installation is unreasonable, and the sugar beets are poorly stored, resulting in the loss of nearly half of the sugar content. During the construction process, workers and staff members made many valuable suggestions regarding the construction project and machine installation, but the administrative leaders did not adopt them. For example, when the factory was building a cold water pool to hold more than 100 tons of water, they acted without scientific calculation or careful research. The original plan was for the pool opening to be one zhang above the ground. Based on practical experience, the workers suggested to the factory that the pool opening should only be two chi above the ground, otherwise it would be prone to danger. This valuable suggestion was not accepted by the administrative cadres and the main responsible design personnel. Once the pool was completed, the water was only half-filled when the pool collapsed because the water's expansive force exceeded the pool's load. Another example is when installing the pipes on the "pulping tank," the technical cadre in charge wanted to install the steam pipe and the carbon dioxide pipe together. The workers said that this would not work and that they should be installed separately. The administrative负责人 (fù zé rén - person in charge) did not listen to the workers' opinions, and the result was that everything had to be reworked. Before the factory was built, there was no thorough investigation or research, nor was there a detailed construction plan. Instead, they took it one step at a time, buying materials only when needed. They grabbed whatever they could find temporarily, resulting in great blindness. Sugar beets were planted in March, but the machines were nowhere to be found. Later, when the machines arrived, they were incomplete. They were hastily pieced together and installed, wasting a lot of money. The factory did not have specialized technical personnel, so it cooperated with Huada Agricultural College, with the technology being the responsibility of Huada Agricultural College and the factory only being responsible for funds and workers. However, because the nature and responsibilities of the cooperation were not clearly stipulated in writing beforehand, the Agricultural College only participated in the work with an attitude of experimentation and assistance, which weakened the technical personnel's sense of responsibility, and the design work was careless. Many of the factory's construction projects and machine installations were not accompanied by drawings. Some had drawings, but they lacked dimensions. Sometimes, the engineers would even gesture with their hands or scribble a few lines with chalk and have the workers do it. As a result, the completed work or the manufactured tools were not up to standard, resulting in serious waste due to rework and material wastage.

　　石家庄新中国制糖厂建厂工程中浪费严重
    【本报石家庄讯】记者张荣安报道：石家庄新中国制糖厂自去年六月开始建厂以来，发生多次反工背料的严重浪费现象。这是该厂行政领导干部缺乏依靠工人管理工厂的观念，缺乏企业化的经营思想的结果。该厂共安装四十五种一百零九部机器，大大小小都反过工。据账面记载，这些机器因反工背料，共浪费小米三万三千余斤。但据记者了解，实际数目远不止此数。该厂去年制造了八部“离心机”，使用不久，就坏了三部，每部值小米一万五千斤。该厂一部最大的制糖机器“浸丝罐”，因制造安装不善，使用中屡修屡坏，有一次因修理机器，停工四天四夜，使生产遭受重大损失。该厂全部机器安装不合理，糖菜又保管不善，损失糖分将近二分之一。在建厂过程中，工人和职员对建筑工程和安装机器曾提出很多宝贵意见，行政领导干部均未采纳。如该厂建筑存一百多吨水的冷水池时，没有经过科学计算，精密研究，即行动工。原计划池口要高出地面一丈，工人根据实际经验，向厂方提出：池口只能高出地面二尺，否则易出危险。这种宝贵的意见，竟没有为行政干部和主要负责设计人员接受。水池落成，水刚放了一半，由于水的膨胀力超过了该池的负荷，水池就垮了。又如安装“分浆罐”上的管子时，负责技术干部要把蒸汽管和二氧化炭管安在一起，工人说这样不行，应分开按。行政负责人不听工人意见，结果全部反工。该厂建厂以前，完全没有周密的调查研究，又未作详细的建厂计划，而是走了一步说一步，用着什么材料才买什么。临时东抓西凑，盲目性很大。糖萝苋三月份就下种了，但机器还不知在那里。以后机器来了，又很不完整，东拚西凑匆促安装，花了许多冤枉钱。该厂没有专门技术人员，遂与华大农学院合作，技术由华大农学院负责，工厂仅负责资金工人。但因事前对合作的性质和责任没有明文规定清楚，农学院只是抱着一种试验和帮忙的态度参加工作，因此减弱了技术人员的责任心，设计工作表现了粗枝大叶。该厂不少建筑工程和机器安装时，没有制图，有的制了图，但没有尺寸。有时甚至是由工程师用手比划着或用粉笔了了草草划上几笔，就让工人去做。因此，完成的工作或制出的工具，十分不合规格，造成反工背料的严重浪费现象。
