　　Su Bao on the Peace Signature Campaign
    The Struggle to Defend Peace and Ban Atomic Weapons Has Become an Important Progressive Factor in the Current International Situation
    [Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd dispatch] TASS, Moscow: Pravda observer Korionov recently wrote an article commenting on the peace signature campaign currently being widely carried out around the world, stating: The struggle to ban atomic weapons has become a central link in strengthening the entire cause of peace. This struggle warns the instigators of war: whoever attempts to use atomic weapons will be severely punished by the people – this is the path now leading to the defense of peace.
    The movement to sign the declaration of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace is expanding and growing daily. The recent joint meeting of various trade union internationals held in Budapest enthusiastically supported the Stockholm Conference's declaration. In addition to the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and the International Union of Students, a large number of international organizations have also endorsed this declaration and demanded that their members support the demand to ban atomic weapons.
    At present, the tasks stipulated by the supporters of peace are not limited to collecting as many signatures as possible, but also require those who refuse to sign the declaration calling for the prohibition of atomic weapons to explain their reasons. It is impossible to take a neutral stance in the struggle to ban atomic weapons. The future of mankind, the lives of billions of people, and the fate of world civilization have reached a critical juncture. At this time, the billions of people fighting for peace justly demand that scientists, writers, artists, members of parliament, and clergy state their position: whether they stand on the side of those who hope for peace and actively support the cause of peace, or on the side of those who are preparing for a new war.
    [Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd dispatch] TASS, Moscow: Izvestia recently published an editorial entitled "The People's Struggle for Peace," stating: The people's movement for peace demonstrates the increasingly surging spiritual and political strength of this movement. The movement to defend peace has become an important progressive factor in the current international situation. The greatest significance of the peace movement lies in the fact that it not only helps ordinary people to recognize the dangers threatening their families and clans, but also mobilizes their strength to oppose the evil plans of Wall Street and the City of London.
    The editorial pointed out: Reports from all over the world show that the call issued by the Stockholm Conference of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace has been responded to by millions of men and women in Europe and Asia, and is gaining more and more supporters every day.
    In capitalist countries, the struggle for peace has become the main link in the chain of historical tasks of the working class, and the working class in these countries has already united the broadest masses around itself on the basis of a common program to defend peace.
    In the United States, progressive organizations have launched a signature campaign. The Peace Congress scheduled to be held in Chicago on May 29 will be an important stage in this movement.
    The editorial also pointed out: The signature collection campaign has not yet been fully launched. To achieve this, all supporters of peace still need greater unity, organization, and more activity. The task is to unite all men and women who do not want war to fight for peace, and to collect hundreds of millions of signatures by the time the Second World Congress of Supporters of Peace opens.

　　苏报论和平签名运动
    保卫和平、禁止原子武器的斗争已成目前国际形势中重要进步因素
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：真理报观察家科里奥诺夫顷著文评论目前在全世界广泛展开的和平签名运动称：禁止原子武器的斗争，已经成为加强整个和平事业中的中心环节。这种斗争警告战争的挑拨者：谁企图利用原子武器，谁就要受到人民的严惩——这便是现在导向保卫和平的道路。
    在和大常设委员会的宣言上签名的运动，正在日益扩展与增长中。各工会国际最近在布达佩斯举行的联席会议，热烈地支持斯德哥尔摩会议的宣言。除了世界工联，国际民主妇联，世界民主青联，国际学联以外，还有大批国际性的组织都拥护这一宣言，都要求它们的会员支持禁止原子武器的要求。
    在目前，和平支持者规定了的任务，还不仅限于尽量征集签名，而且还要求拒绝在要求禁止原子武器的宣言上签名的人们解释理由。在禁止原子武器的斗争中，是不可能采取中立的立场的。人类的将来，亿万人们的生命，世界文明的命运，都已到了危急的关头。在这种时候，为争取和平而斗争的亿万人民，就十分公正地要求科学家、作家、艺术工作者、国会议员与教士们表明态度：他们究竟是站在希望和平而且积极拥护和平事业的人们一边，还是站在准备新战争的人们一边。
    【新华社二十三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报顷发表题为《人民争取和平的斗争》的社论称：人民争取和平的运动，证明了这一运动的精神上和政治上巨大力量的日益汹涌澎湃。拥护和平运动业已成为现在国际形势中的重要的进步因素。和平运动最伟大的意义即在于：它不仅帮助普通人民来认识威肋着他们的家庭与家族的危险，而且也动员了他们的力量来反对华尔街与伦敦城的罪恶计划。
    社论指出：来自世界各国的报道表明：和大常设委员会斯德哥尔摩会议所发出的号召，已经在欧亚各国获得千百万男女的响应，并逐日争取到更多的拥护者。
    在资本主义国家内争取和平的斗争，已成为工人阶级历史任务链条中的主要环节，而且，各该国工人阶级业已以保卫和平的共同纲领为基础，把最广大的群众团结在自己的周围了。
    在美国，各进步组织已发动了签名运动。订于五月二十九日在芝加哥举行的和平大会，将是这一运动的重要阶段。
    社论同时指出：征集签名的运动尚未全面展开。为达到这一点，仍须一切和平拥护者有更大的团结、组织和更多的活动。任务在于团结一切不愿战争的男女为和平而斗争，到第二届世界拥护和平大会开幕的时候，要征集到几万万人的签名。
