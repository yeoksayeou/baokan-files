　　Northeast Anshan Iron and Steel Company
　　Strengthens Safety Teams
　　Industrial and Mining Accidents Greatly Reduced
　　[Our Dispatch] The work of the safety teams in various units of the state-owned Anshan Iron and Steel Company in Northeast China has been significantly strengthened, greatly reducing accidents in industrial and mining operations. Of the 554 safety teams under the factory’s jurisdiction, 92 percent have been able to function effectively since being reorganized last winter, ensuring safe production. In the Gongchangling Mining Area under the factory's jurisdiction, 36 accidents occurred in the three months from October to December last year, while only five accidents occurred in the first three months of this year. The strengthening of the safety team's work is mainly due to the Party branches and administrations in the factories and mines attaching importance to security work, while public security personnel have established close ties with the broad masses of workers, established safety systems, and clarified the specific work of the teams. Before the reorganization of the safety teams last winter, workers felt that participating in the safety teams was a burden, and the work remained at the level of slogans and meetings. Later, safety team leaders and members were trained (without leaving production), and the workers' awareness was raised through meetings, individual talks, and especially through educational methods that combined accident reviews, notifications of accidents in neighboring factories, and introductions to experiences in newspapers with practical situations. For example, in the process of democratically electing team leaders, many advanced workers came forward to run for election and actively reported situations to the factory and mine security organs. After the masses were mobilized, the work of the team was improved, and inspection systems (checking machines and tools on and off work, general inspections once a week, and special inspections when faults are found during operation, etc.), handover systems (handing over the condition of machines and tools and tasks on and off work to facilitate tracing the responsibility for accidents), machine tool custody responsibility systems (individuals are fully responsible for tools used by individuals, and rotating shifts are responsible for tools used jointly), accident reporting systems, and visiting systems were established. After the establishment of these systems, responsibilities are clear, accidents can be prevented in advance, and even if they occur, they will not lead to major losses.

　　加强安全小组
　　工矿事故大减
    【本报讯】东北国营鞍山钢铁公司各单位的安全小组工作已有显著加强，大大减少了工矿中的事故。该厂所辖范围内的五百五十四个安全小组，自去年冬季先后整顿后，已有百分之九十二能发挥作用，保证安全进行生产。该厂所属弓长岭矿区，在去年十月至十二月三个月中，曾发生事故三十六次，而今年头三个月仅发生五次。安全小组工作的加强，主要是由于厂矿中的中共支部与行政重视保卫工作，同时公安人员与广大工人建立了密切的联系，建立了安全制度，明确了小组具体工作所致。去冬安全小组未整顿前，工人们认为参加安全小组是负担，工作停留在口号和会议上。后来集训了安全小组长和组员（不脱离生产），并以会议、个别谈话，特别是采用事故检讨、邻厂事故通报、报纸经验介绍等与实际相结合教育方法，提高了工人的觉悟，如民主选举组长过程中，不少先进工人出来竞选，并主动向厂矿保卫机关反映情况。群众发动之后，进而健全了小组的工作，建立了检查制度（上下班检查机器、工具，每周普检一次，运转发现故障时举行特殊检查等）、交接制度（上下班交代机器工具情况、任务，以便易于追查事故责任）、机器工具保管责任制（个人使用之工具，个人负全责，共同使用之工具轮值）、事故报告制度、参观制度等。这些制度建立后，责任分明，事故便可能预先防止，发生后也不致酿成重大损失。
