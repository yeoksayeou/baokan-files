Xinhua News Agency, 29th: Japanese coal mine, private railway, and film industry workers have launched a large-scale strike movement demanding wage increases and opposing mass layoffs. Some striking unions have also put forward slogans such as "Oppose War" and "Promote Comprehensive Peace."

According to Tokyo dispatches from foreign bourgeois news agencies: Workers from Japan's five major coal mining companies (Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Iwahara, Furukawa, and Hokkaido) have unanimously decided to hold indefinite strikes beginning on the 24th, due to the management's refusal to increase wages. The strike of 13,000 workers at Iwahara Company's No. 1 mine began first on the 24th. This strike reduced coal production by approximately 5,100 tons per day. At the same time, members of the Tokyo Private Suburban Electric Railway Company unions, belonging to the General Federation of Private Railway Workers' Unions, also held their first 24-hour strike on the 22nd and a larger second 24-hour strike on the 25th because the management refused to meet their demands for wage increases. The second strike brought all five suburban train lines and twenty-one bus routes operated by the Tokyo Express Electric Railway Company to a standstill. Workers have also scheduled third and fourth 24-hour strikes on May 28th and June 1st, respectively. In addition, the cotton spinning union, belonging to the National Federation of Textile Workers' Unions and possessing 160,000 members, issued a declaration of struggle on the 23rd, calling on members to begin a strike on June 1st because negotiations with the management regarding increasing wages for child laborers broke down.

At the same time, workers at the Toho Film Studio in Japan began an indefinite strike on the 25th to oppose the management's plan to lay off one-third of the more than 3,000 workers. The Japan Film and Theater Workers' Union, belonging to the All-Japan Federation of Industrial Unions, has ordered its other members to launch a series of strikes beginning on May 31st. Thirty-two thousand workers from various units of the "Hitachi Manufacturing" company, a large enterprise of Japanese monopoly capital, have been holding widespread wave-like strikes continuously since the 15th because the management announced the layoff of more than 5,500 workers.

　　要求增加工资反对大批解雇
    日工人再度展开大规模罢工
    提出反对战争促进全面媾和等口号
    【新华社二十九日讯】日本煤矿、私营铁道及电影等业工人，为要求增加工资及反对大批解雇，开始展开大规模罢工运动。若干罢工工会并提出了“反对战争”及“促进全面媾和”等口号。
    据外国资产阶级通讯社东京消息：日本五大煤矿公司（三井、三菱、井华、古河及北海道）的工人，因资方拒绝增加工资，一致决定自二十四日起先后举行无限期罢工。井华公司第一号矿坑一万三千名工人的罢工，已于二十四日首先开始。这一罢工使煤产量一天减少约五千一百吨。同时，属于私营铁道工会总联合会的东京各私营市郊电气铁道公司工会会员，也因为资方拒绝满足他们的增加工资的要求，于二十二日举行了第一次二十四小时的罢工，并于二十五日举行规模更大的第二次二十四小时罢工。第二次罢工使东京急行电气铁道公司所经营的五条郊外电车路线及二十一条公共汽车路线，全部停顿。工人并定于五月二十八日及六月一日，分别举行第三及第四次的二十四小时罢工。此外，属于全国纤维工会同盟的拥有十六万名会员的棉纺部工会，因要求资方增加童工工资的谈判宣告破裂，于二十三日发出斗争宣言，号召会员自六月一日起开始罢工。
    与此同时，日本东宝电影制片厂的工人为了反对资方将三千多工人解雇三分之一，自二十五日起开始无限期罢工。属于全日产业别工会联合会的日本电影演剧工会，已命令其他会员自五月三十一日起，展开一系列的罢工。日本垄断资本的大企业“日立制作所”系各单位的工人三万二千名，因为资方宣布解雇五千五百余工人，已自十五日起，连续举行了广泛的波浪式罢工。
