　　【This Newspaper Despatch】According to the May 8th report in the Masses Daily: The Northwest Region recently held its first industrial conference, and based on the new situation, determined the basic guidelines for adjusting industry and commerce, criticized the thinking that hindered the implementation of the economic accounting system, and initially summarized the experience of promoting democratic management. In terms of adjusting industry and commerce: It was decided that, according to the central government's key construction guidelines, the transition of the entire country to peaceful construction, and the unification of transportation, finance, and the economy, the existing industrial situation in the Northwest (excluding Xinjiang) would be fundamentally considered as a whole, along with the specific circumstances of the resources, transportation, labor force, market, and the division of labor between public and private enterprises of each state-owned enterprise unit. The conference determined the adjustment guidelines as follows: First, enterprises that need to be developed, such as cotton textile mills in Shaanxi and Xinjiang, wool washing in Lanzhou and Qinghai, coal mines in Gansu and Qinghai, and the electric power industry in Guanzhong and Lanzhou. In the textile industry, it was decided to add 70,000 spindles starting in 1950, of which 25,000 spindles will be used to build a factory in Xinjiang. Preparations are being made to establish wool washing factories in Gansu and Qinghai provinces. In the electric power industry, 8,200 kilowatts of generating equipment will be added in Xi'an, Lanzhou, Xianyang, Caijiapo, Nanzheng, Yinchuan and other places. Second, enterprises that maintain the current production situation, such as the Tianshui Power Plant, the Xi'an Flour Mill, the Yinchuan Paper Mill, and the Ningxia First and Second Coal Mines. Third, enterprises that need to be appropriately reduced in size, or have their institutions merged, and reduce production volume, such as the Xi'an Soap Factory, the Yan'an Match Factory, and the Xining Leather Factory. Fourth, enterprises that need to be closed down, such as the Ningxia Match Factory and the Yan'an Paper Mill. When discussing this issue, various erroneous ideas were reviewed, such as: the idea of blindly developing production; the short-sighted and conservative idea of being reluctant to reduce or stop production; proceeding from subjective wishes, failing to understand the actual situation after the unification of national finance and economy, and imprudently proposing huge plans requiring money and machinery, and even actually developing individual factories that lacked the conditions for development. It was unanimously agreed that only by acting in accordance with the spirit of key construction, and distinguishing between priorities, could capital be accumulated and production developed.

　　The conference believes that implementing the economic accounting system is the key issue in the current industrial construction of the Northwest. In the past, due to the failure to resolutely rely on the working class and the influence of the wartime industrial supply system thinking, there had been a tendency to only pursue production, without regard to the market and costs, resulting in serious production waste. In order to change this situation, the conference introduced the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and the Northeast, and decided to carry out work with reference to the Northeast's experience of "How to Implement the Economic Accounting System." Regarding the issue of democratic management, Northwest state-owned factories have gradually implemented it. The current shortcoming is that the leadership cannot keep up with the demands of the masses, so opening up the thinking of the leadership and transforming the thinking of the staff are the main keys to implementing democratic management.

　　西北召开首届工业会议
　　根据重点建设方针确定工业调整办法
    【本报讯】据群众日报五月八日消息：西北区最近举行的第一届工业会议，根据新的情况，确定了调整工商业的基本方针，批判了阻碍贯彻经济核算制的思想，并初步总结了推广民主管理化的经验。在调整工商业方面：决定根据中央重点建设的方针，和全国转入和平建设及交通财政经济统一等情况，全盘地根本地考虑了西北（除新疆外）现有的工业状况，和每一个公营企业单位的资源、交通、劳动力、市场及公私企业分工等具体情况。会议确定调整方针为：第一、需要发展的企业，如陕西新疆的棉纺织，兰州青海的洗毛，甘肃与青海的煤矿和关中、兰州的电力事业。在纺织业方面，决定一九五○年开始增设纱锭七万枚，其中二万五千枚在新疆建厂。准备在甘青两省设立洗毛厂。在电业方面，于西安、兰州、咸阳、蔡家坡、南郑、银川等地增加发电设备八千二百千瓦。第二、维持目前生产状况的企业如天水电厂、西安粉厂、银川纸厂、宁夏第一第二煤矿等企业。第三、需要适当缩小，或合并机构，减少生产量的企业，如西安肥皂厂、延安火柴厂、西宁皮革厂等企业。第四、需要停闭的企业，如宁夏火柴厂、延安纸厂等企业。在讨论这个问题的时候，曾检讨了各种错误的思想，如：盲目的发展生产的思想，舍不得缩小和停产的近视和保守思想；从主观愿望出发，不了解全国财经统一后的实际的情况，而不慎重的提出庞大的要钱要机器的计划，有的甚至实际发展了个别没有发展条件的工厂等思想；一致认为唯有根据重点建设的精神，分别轻重缓急，才能积累资本，发展生产。
    会议认为贯彻经济核算制是目前西北工业建设中的关键问题。过去由于未能坚决依靠工人阶级，及战时工业供给制的思想影响，曾经发生只求生产，不问市场和成本的偏向，造成了严重的生产浪费现象。为了改变这种情况，会议介绍了苏联及东北的先进经验，并决定参照东北“如何贯彻经济核算制”的经验进行工作。关于民主管理化问题，西北公营工厂已逐渐实行。目前的缺点是领导赶不上群众的要求，所以打通领导思想和改造职员思想，是贯彻民主管理化的主要的关键。
