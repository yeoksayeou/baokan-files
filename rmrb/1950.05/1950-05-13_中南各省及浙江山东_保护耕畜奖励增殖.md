Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch: To guarantee the completion of this year’s increased grain and cotton production tasks, the People's Governments of the Central South provinces, Zhejiang, and Shandong in East China are actively carrying out livestock protection and propagation work.

　　The People's Governments of the Central South provinces have all issued announcements on protecting draught animals, rewarding farmers for improving the feeding and management of draught animals, and strictly prohibiting the slaughter of strong livestock. At the same time, in order to reduce the mortality of draught animals, the People's Governments of the Central South regions have listed the prevention and control of livestock diseases as an important item in the agricultural production plan, and have established epidemic prevention work teams or prevention and control stations in various places to carry out livestock disease prevention and control work. Jiangxi, Henan, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces have all established and restored serum manufacturing plants to produce rinderpest vaccine serum. Currently, rinderpest in 17 counties including Nanyang and Xinyang in Henan Province has been rapidly extinguished, with 1,400 head of cattle cured, and preventive injections have been given to more than 270,000 head of draught animals. The Provincial People's Government is also preparing to establish ten livestock disease stations in various special districts, and plans to give preventive injections to 1 million to 1.5 million head of draught animals within six months. The Jiangxi Provincial People's Government has decided that the provincial serum manufacturing plant will produce 1 million cc of rinderpest serum this year. In addition to supplying the province's need for preventive injections for 150,000 head of cattle, the serum produced will also be supplied to neighboring provinces. The Guangdong Provincial People's Government is preparing to give preventive injections to 250,000 head of cattle this year. The Guangxi Provincial People's Government plans to establish a rinderpest intelligence network throughout the province and nine veterinary epidemic prevention stations to carry out veterinary epidemic prevention and control work. In addition, under the principle of protecting existing draught animals, the People's Governments of the Central South provinces are also paying attention to rewarding the propagation of draught animals in areas with better conditions. After the land reform, farmers in Linru and Lushan counties in Henan Province have increased their purchase of 7,300 head of livestock with the encouragement of the local government. Farmers in various parts of Hubei Province have also received 5 million catties of loan grain issued by the Provincial People's Government for the purchase of draught animals.

　　In order to strengthen agricultural and animal husbandry conservation work in a planned way, the Department of Industry of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government in East China has sent a large number of veterinary staff to establish veterinary epidemic prevention stations in Jiaxing, Jinhua, Quzhou, Hangzhou and other places, and established veterinary epidemic prevention work groups in Shaoxing, Ningbo, Taizhou, Lishui and other places. These prevention stations and work groups will be responsible for training epidemic prevention personnel in various places, establishing mass veterinary epidemic intelligence and epidemic prevention organizations, and injecting more than 90,000 head of livestock to prevent diseases such as bovine anthrax, swine erysipelas, swine hemorrhagic septicemia, and hog cholera. In addition, the prevention stations and groups in various places will also conduct planned guidance on livestock hygiene and nutrition and livestock markets, as well as carry out livestock feeding competitions and livestock insurance. The livestock epidemic prevention teams and veterinary hospitals in various parts of Shandong Province have actively started spring livestock epidemic prevention injection work since March 10. By mid-April, the province had injected more than 150,000 head of livestock. In general counties and districts, more than 60 percent of the total number of livestock have been injected, and in areas with better results, the number has reached more than 80 percent.

　　中南各省及浙江山东
　　保护耕畜奖励增殖
    【新华社十二日讯】中南各省及华东浙江、山东两省人民政府，为着保证今年粮棉增产任务的完成，都在积极进行牲畜的防护和增殖工作。
    中南各省人民政府都曾发出保护耕畜的布告，奖励农民改进耕畜的饲养和管理，严禁屠宰壮畜。同时，为了减少耕畜的死亡，中南各地人民政府都将防治畜疫工作列为农业生产计划中的重要一项，并在各地设立防疫工作队或防治工作站，展开防治畜疫的工作；江西、河南、湖南、广东、广西等省又都设立和恢复了血清制造厂，制造牛瘟疫苗血清。现河南省南阳、信阳等十七个县的牛瘟已被迅速扑灭，治愈耕牛一千四百头，并已有二十七万余头耕畜进行预防注射。该省人民政府还准备在各专区设立十个畜疫站，计划在半年内预防注射一百万头到一百五十万头耕畜。江西省人民政府决定在本年内由该省血清制造所制造牛瘟血清一百万西西，除供应本省十五万头耕牛预防注射的需要外，并将所制血清供给邻省应用。广东省人民政府准备今年预防注射耕牛二十五万头。广西省人民政府则计划在省内普遍建立牛瘟情报网和九个兽疫防治站，进行兽疫防治工作。此外，在保护现有耕畜为主的方针下，中南各省人民政府又注意在条件较好的地区奖励增殖耕畜。河南省经过土地改革后的临汝、鲁山两县农民，在当地政府的奖励下已增买牲畜七千三百头。湖北省各地农民，也得到了该省人民政府发放的购买耕牛的五百万斤贷粮。
    华东区浙江省人民政府实业厅为有计划地加强农畜保育工作，已派出大批兽医工作人员在嘉兴、金华、衢州、杭州等地设立兽疫防治站，并在绍兴、宁波、台州、丽水等地设立兽疫防治工作组。这些防治站和工作组将负责训练各地的防疫工作人员，建立群众性的兽疫情报和防疫组织，并将九万余头牲畜予以注射，以预防牛炭疽、猪丹毒、猪出血性败血症和猪霍乱等病疫。此外，各地的防治站和组还将有计划地进行家畜卫生营养和家畜市场的指导，以及开展家畜喂养竞赛、举办家畜保险等工作。山东省各地的牲畜防疫队和兽医院在三月十日起即已积极开始春季牲畜防疫注射工作，到四月中旬，该省共已注射了十五万余头牲畜；在一般县、区，占总数百分之六十以上的牲畜都受了注射，成绩较好的地区则达百分之八十以上。
