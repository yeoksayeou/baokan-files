Hegang Coal Mine Inspects Democratic Management
Nanshan Management Committee Improves Work

[This newspaper dispatch] (By our correspondent Chen Gengfu) The Hegang Coal Mine is adopting the method of criticism and self-criticism to inspect the democratic management situation in the mine. It is now further implementing the instructions of the State Council's Finance and Economics Committee on establishing management committees in state-owned and public-operated factories and mines, improving the work of the management committees, and overcoming the shortcomings of formalism. From April of last year to January of this year, 28 production units in the mining area have established three-level management committee organizations: pit, mine, and bureau. Recently, the mine launched a comprehensive study based on the State Council's Finance and Economics Committee's "Instructions on Establishing Management Committees in State-Owned and Public-Operated Factories and Mines" and the joint "Instructions on Implementing Democratic Management" from the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Coal Miners' Union and the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry. And in accordance with the spirit of the documents, a thorough inspection of democratic management issues was carried out. The Nanshan Mining Pit has achieved certain results since the establishment of the management committee and the workers' representative assembly.

          Implementing Democratic Management to Ensure Completion of Tasks

The relationship between leaders and the masses has begun to become closer. Leaders, through the management committee and representative assembly, convey the monthly production plans and work intentions to the workers, turning them into production plans and opinions of the workers. Each group and each worker has set a plan and is carrying out quota production. When the mine implemented the new coal mining method last December, the original staff was reduced by 208 people. After discussions by the management committee and the representative assembly, and based on work needs and the principle of voluntary combination, production organizations were formed, thus quickly completing this urgent task. Because the management committee and the representative assembly absorbed the representatives of technical personnel and staff, and regularly studied issues together, the relationship between employees was effectively improved.

          Not Relying on the Workers; Management Committee Becomes Formalistic

On the other hand, there are still many shortcomings of formalism in the work of the mine's management committee and workers' representative assembly. Such as the organization is not sound enough, meetings are not frequent enough, and not many problems are solved. The roots of these shortcomings are: (1) Some leading comrades do not have a clear enough understanding of relying on the workers to manage the people's enterprises well. For example, Xing Shan's Mine Manager Li believes: "Worker representatives only know about one working face, they don't know about the whole pit"; some cadres believe: "Too many meetings are troublesome, cadre meetings can also solve problems, and cadres can also reflect situations." Therefore, these comrades rarely take the initiative to convene management committees. Some grassroots administrative cadres mistakenly believe that administration is above all else. For example, Dongshan No. 7 Pit Foreman Cui Ruitai said: "Meetings are a formality, it's invalid if I don't stamp it." The union chairman sincerely advised him to promote a democratic style, he said: "I am the chairman of the meeting, I am the one who speaks, the workers can't say anything, it's a waste of time." Xing Shan's worker representatives reflected: "We are not allowed to speak at meetings, we are here to listen, what kind of democracy is this?!"

Some management committees or representative assemblies have also failed to effectively solve the main problems in current production. On April 17, the Nanshan No. 12 Pit held a representative meeting to discuss how to ensure the completion of the plan because the production task for the first half of the month was not completed. The meeting only discussed how to make workers work more shifts and mobilize everyone's enthusiasm. The worker representatives pointed out: The wage rates have not yet been announced, the workers don't know the bottom line, which affects the mood of production, but this issue was not resolved. The pit foreman also said: "Today we are discussing how to complete the task, not the wage rate issue." The representatives insisted on resolving the unit price issue, the two sides were at a standstill, and the meeting adjourned without results. The workers' morale was therefore lowered. Other old problems related to production, such as rail cars, pickaxe handles, and safety light bulbs, have not been resolved despite repeated suggestions from lower-level management committees. Worker cadres feel that meetings are a waste of time and cannot solve problems.

          Absorb Workers' Opinions and Solve Current Problems

After the above shortcomings were discovered, the mine is gradually improving. The main link is to get through the thinking of the cadres, and truly realize that under the administrative chief responsibility system, all major production issues must be discussed by the management committee with half of the worker representatives participating. And through the management committee and the workers' representative assembly, solve the problems that workers urgently demand to be resolved, such as unified wage rates, pickaxe handles, rail cars, and attendance.

### 鹤岗煤矿检查民主管理　南山管委会改进工作

　　鹤岗煤矿检查民主管理
　　南山管委会改进工作
    【本报讯】本报特约通讯员陈耕夫报道：鹤岗煤矿采取批评与自我批评的方法，检查该矿民主管理情况。现正进一步贯彻政务院财委会关于国公营厂矿建立管委会的指示，健全管委会工作，克服形式主义的缺点。从去年四月到今年一月间，该矿区二十八个生产单位，都已成立坑、矿、局三级管委会的组织。该矿最近根据政务院财委会《关于各国营公营厂矿建立管理委员会的指示》和中央燃料工业部、中国煤矿工会筹备会的《关于贯彻管理民主化的联合指示》，发动全矿进行普遍学习。并根据文件精神，展开关于民主管理问题的深入检查。该矿南山矿坑成立管委会及职工代表会以来，已获得一定的成绩。
            实行民主管理  保证完成任务
    领导与群众之间的关系开始密切起来。领导者经过管委会、代表会，将每月的生产计划、工作意图传达给工人群众，变为工人群众的生产计划和意见。每个小组、每个工人都订了计划，进行定额生产。该矿去年十二月实施新式采煤法时，原有人员减少二○八名。经过管委会、代表会讨论，根据工作需要、自愿结合的原则，组成生产组织，因而迅速地完成了这一迫切任务。由于管委会、代表会吸收了技术人员与职员的代表参加，经常在一块研究问题，有力地改善了职工之间的关系。
            不依靠工人群众  管委会流于形式
    在另一方面，该矿管委会和职工代表会工作中，还存在着许多形式主义的缺点。如组织不够健全，会议不经常，解决问题不多等。发生这些缺点的根源是：（一）某些领导同志对依靠工人群众，管好人民企业的认识还不够明确，如兴山李矿长认为：“工人代表只知道一个掌子的事情，他不知道全坑的事”；有的干部则认为：“会议多，麻烦，开干部会议也可以解决问题，干部也可以反映情况。”因此，这些同志就很少主动地召开管委会。有的基层行政干部误认为行政高于一切。如东山七坑坑长崔瑞台说：“开会是形式，我不盖章，还是无效。”工会主席诚恳的劝他发扬民主作风，他说：“开会主席是我，说话的是我，工友说不出来什么，白费时间。”兴山工人代表则反映：“开会不让我们发言，是要我们来听会的，这算什么民主！？”
    某些管委会或代表会还未能有力地解决当前生产中的主要问题。四月十七日，南山十二坑因上半月生产任务未完成，开代表会研究如何保证完成计划。会议只讨论了如何使工人多出勤，发动大家积极性的问题。工人代表提出：现在还未宣布工资单价，工人不摸底，影响了生产情绪，这个问题就没有解决。坑长还说：“今天讨论的是如何完成任务，而不是工资单价问题。”代表仍坚持要解决单价问题，双方相持不决，无结果散会。工人情绪因此降低，其它有关生产之车皮、镐把、安全灯泡等老问题，虽经下级管委会多次提出意见，始终未获解决。工人干部都觉得开会也是白开，不能解决问题。
            吸收工人意见  解决当前问题
    上述缺点发现后，该矿正逐步改进。主要的一环是打通干部思想，真正实现在行政首长负责制下，一切生产上的重大问题，都必须经过有半数工人代表参加的管委会讨论的原则。并通过管委会和职工代表会，解决工人迫切要求解决的统一工资单价、镐把、车皮、出勤等问题。
