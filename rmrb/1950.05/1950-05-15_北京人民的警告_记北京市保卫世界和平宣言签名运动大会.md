　　Beijing People's Warning
　　A Record of the Beijing Municipal Declaration for World Peace Signature Campaign Rally

　　Yesterday afternoon, more than six thousand representatives of peace supporters in the capital, Beijing, held a Declaration for World Peace signature campaign rally at the Altar of Land and Grain in Zhongshan Park, in front of Zhongshan Hall. At the meeting, the representatives unanimously responded to the call of the Permanent Committee of the World Peace Congress, issuing a resounding demand for the unconditional ban on atomic weapons and to defend world peace. This call will quickly spread throughout the country and to the world, converging with the calls of peace supporters from various countries into a vast ocean – an ocean that will bury any warmongers.

　　Yesterday the weather was particularly clear. In the meeting place, surrounded by green trees, dozens of red flags fluttered in the sunlight, appearing especially magnificent and bright. Soldiers in yellow military uniforms, railway workers in blue clothes, farmers wearing straw hats, cadres in gray clothes, Young Pioneers wearing red scarves, and students and women in white, floral, and various colored clothes, sat on the ground around the rostrum, turning the meeting place into a large flowerbed. In front of the rostrum, a "Peace Dove," and portraits of Chairman Mao and Stalin were hung high, facing the audience.

　　The conference solemnly began at exactly two o'clock. Chairman Guo Moruo, fifteen girls, and four Young Pioneers released thirty-four doves. These symbols of peace – the white doves – swirled in the clear blue sky, swirling above a sea of red flags. People applauded thunderously, praising this moving scene. Of course, no one here would imagine tolerating any warmongers destroying the peaceful life of the Chinese people.

　　The victorious Chinese people will fight together with the people of the world to defend lasting world peace! In his speech, Chairman Guo Moruo ridiculed Truman, who uses atomic bombs to intimidate humanity. He said that if Truman dares to drop an atomic bomb again, we will definitely declare him a war criminal. He issued a powerful warning: If imperialism dares to launch a new war, it will be their last cremation!

　　Comrade Xiao San, our country's representative to the Stockholm meeting of the World Peace Congress Standing Committee, recounted the story of a French female worker who, upon seeing a train carrying tanks, lay on the tracks to stop it from moving forward. He said: There are many such moving stories all over the world! Peace-loving people in countries around the world are signing to defend peace. Every signature is a warning to war criminals!

　　Our People's Liberation Army soldiers will never understand people like Truman. The representative of the Central Public Security Corps said: The atomic bomb is not something "sacred." The powerful People's Liberation Army is not afraid of the threat of atomic bombs.

　　In order to defend peace:

　　Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu called on the two million people of Beijing to enthusiastically sign the declaration.

　　The representative of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions called on the city's 400,000 workers to launch a production competition.

　　Representatives of suburban farmers vowed to work hard in production to defend peaceful labor.

　　Representatives from the scientific community called for reclaiming the gift that scientists gave to humanity – atomic energy – from the hands of imperialism.

　　Representatives of women and students called on women, youth, and students to actively participate in the peace signature campaign.

　　Representatives of the religious community called on peace-loving believers to oppose imperialist conspiracies to use religion for aggression.

　　Finally, the conference passed the peace declaration amidst thunderous applause. When signing, the dozen signature books on the tables at the four corners of the rostrum were grabbed by representatives from all walks of life. Representatives from the Beijing-Tianjin Railway Machinery Plant took the lead in signing their names. A farmer carefully wrote his name neatly, and an elderly lady in her fifties signed her name on the paper with her trembling hands.

　　A signature is a warning to the warmongers!

　　The people of Beijing, the capital of People's China, have issued this warning.

　　The entire country of China will widely launch a peace signature campaign to warn all warmongers who dream of launching a new war! (Guang Rui · Tie Min)

　　北京人民的警告
　　记北京市保卫世界和平宣言签名运动大会
    昨天下午，首都北京和平拥护者的六千多代表们，在中山公园中山堂前的社稷坛，举行了保卫世界和平宣言签名运动大会。在大会上，代表们一致响应世界和平大会常设委员会的号召，发出响亮的要求无条件禁用原子武器、保卫世界和平的呼声。这呼声将迅速地传播到全国去，传播到全世界去，和各国和平拥护者的呼声汇成一片壮阔的海洋——将使任何战争贩子葬身的海洋。
    昨天天气特别晴朗，被绿树围绕着的会场上，几十面红旗飘扬在阳光下，显得特别壮丽、鲜明。穿着黄色军服的战士们，穿着蓝色衣服的铁路职工们，戴着草帽的农民们，穿着灰色衣服的机关干部们，围着红领巾的少先队员们和穿着白的、花的各色衣服的学生和妇女们，他们围着主席台在地上坐下来，把会场变成一个大的花坛。在主席台前，迎面高悬着“和平之鸽”、毛主席和斯大林的画像。
    大会在二时正庄严地宣布开始。由郭沫若主席、十五个女孩子和四个少先队员们放出三十四只鸽子，这和平的象征——白色的鸽子们，在蓝得透明的天空中飞旋着，在一片红色的旗帜之上飞旋着，人们以如雷的掌声赞颂这动人的情景。当然，在这里没有人会设想容忍作何战争贩子们来破坏中国人民的和平生活的。
    胜利了的中国人民，将和全世界人民一起为保卫世界持久和平而斗争！郭沫若主席在致词中，讥讽手拿原子弹来威吓人类的杜鲁门；他说，如果杜鲁门再敢投一次原子弹，我们一定封他为战争罪犯。他发出有力的警告说：如果帝国主义敢于发动新战争，就是他们的最后一次的火葬！
    我国参加世界和大常设委员会斯德哥尔摩会议的代表萧三同志，在报告出席会议经过时，重又讲起一个法国女工，有一次看到一列载着坦克的火车开来时，躺在铁轨上阻止它前进的故事。他说：在世界各地像这样动人的故事多得很呢！世界各国爱好和平的人民都在签名保卫和平，一个签名，就是一个对战争罪犯的警告！
    我们解放军的战士们，决不会理解如杜鲁门之流的。中央公安纵队的战士代表说：原子弹不是什么“神圣”的，强大的人民解放军，决不怕原子弹的威胁。
    为了保卫和平：
    张友渔副市长号召北京市二百万人民热烈签名。
    市总工会代表号召全市四十万工人展开生产竞赛。
    郊区农民代表宣誓努力生产，保卫和平劳动。
    科学界代表号召从帝国主义手中夺回来科学家赠予人类的礼物——原子能。
    妇女和学生代表们号召妇女、青年和学生们热烈参加和平签名。
    宗教界代表号召爱好和平的教徒们，反对帝国主义利用宗教进行侵略的阴谋。
    最后大会在雷动的掌声中，通过和平宣言。在进行签名时，主席台四角桌子上的十几个签名簿，被各界代表抢着签名。京津铁路机厂的代表们带头签上自己的名字，一位农民用力地把自己的名字写得端正，一位五十多岁的老太太用她颤颤抖抖的手在纸上签上自己的姓名。
    一个签名就是一个对战争贩子的警告！
    人民中国的首都——北京的人民已经发出这个警告。
    全中国将广泛展开和平签名运动，来警告一切梦想发动新战争的战争贩子们！（光锐·铁民）
