Reflecting Life in Newspapers
    Notes on Studying "On News in Newspapers"
    Wang Ping
    Every matter discussed in the article "On News in Newspapers" is something that any journalist has experienced or is experiencing. Therefore, reading it feels concrete, detailed, intimate, and very enlightening and helpful.
    In the past, we also did business summaries, but because we didn't delve into the small details of the work, it was always difficult to avoid generalities; sometimes, we even mistakenly considered some key specific events as "trivial matters" not worth mentioning and excluded them from the summary, such as sections six and seven in the article – "Sources of Errors in Newspapers" and "Editorial Department's Inspection of Manuscripts," which mention things like taking notes, correcting names, transmitting manuscripts by telephone, and checking against the original manuscript. These are all "trivial matters" on which we were unwilling to spend energy in the past. However, "fatal confusion" and all kinds of errors that "embarrass the author and the newspaper" arise from these neglected "trivial matters." "Errors are the result of haste, recklessness, and complacency." Our viewing of some things we understand inaccurately and incorrectly as "trivial matters" is a typical form of recklessness, a typical form of complacency, and thus causes us many errors that should and could be avoided. Personally, I have long had the business experience of carrying several pencils, but I have always treated it as a small matter and failed to do it conscientiously, which led to a recent mistake: to record an important conversation, my fountain pen ran out of ink, so I borrowed the fountain pen of the person I was interviewing—a responsible comrade—for use. Carelessly, I dropped it on the floor and bent the nib, embarrassing everyone.
    Regarding the timeliness of news, this is originally not a problem at all. The word "news" itself contains a strong sense of timeliness. However, even today, many journalists are limited by rural habits and see it as a "small matter," thinking that as long as there is no problem with the policy, everything is fine. They do not know that correctly grasping the policy is completely necessary and a fundamental aspect, but when using news as a weapon to publicize and reflect the policy, it is even more effective and powerful if it is timely. "What is the point of writing about a conference two or three weeks after it has opened? ... The requirement for the freshness of manuscripts should be strictly observed." This is indeed worthy of close attention by journalists who neglect the timeliness of news. We are often indifferent to the criticism from many readers that "Why is this reported so long after it happened?" This is an incorrect attitude.
    We must delve into the depths of our work, search for small links that are prone to errors, and improve and strengthen our unsystematic, half-baked news business. This is the first strong inspiration I have gained from studying "On News in Newspapers."
    The second strong inspiration is that we have neglected too much in the past and today the use of "living examples," using the "logic of life," the "logic of facts" as the content of our reports. "We still pay very little attention to the daily aspects of life in factories, villages, and troops." (Lenin: "On the Nature of Our Newspapers") The General Administration of News issued a "Directive on Strengthening Reports on Practical Work" on October 23rd last year, pointing out: "As for news about the dynamics of practical work, it is very rare." The General Administration of News wants us to "In addition to reporting general political trends, we must regularly and systematically reflect and guide the lives and struggles of the working people." From this, it can be seen that the phenomenon of neglecting reports on living examples is very serious.
    I have identified the following point as the reason for this phenomenon:
    I feel that there is a kind of thinking that is divorced from specific conditions existing among us. This is that we often isolate ourselves to "study problems," to write articles on experiences and lessons learned, thinking that such articles have "guiding" significance. We have not realized that "news is essentially practical," and every concrete fact itself has logic. If we appropriately reflect the fact itself, the "logic of fact" is education. With that kind of business thinking divorced from specific conditions, we inevitably neglect or even despise reporting living concrete facts, and we cannot help but stagnate at the stage of interviewing "mouths" (talking with responsible comrades) and interviewing "documents" (looking at summaries, etc.) and are unable and unwilling to go deeper, so what we write inevitably becomes a dry set of A, B, C, D, one, two, three, four, etc. We are not good at "using living examples of socialist construction (in today's China, it is new democratic construction. The same below. – Author) to educate workers," "allowing readers to see the victory of communist ideas from the living concrete facts of socialist construction." We are not yet good at "selecting facts so that they can call out for us, for our cause." What Lenin said in 1918 in "On the Nature of Our Newspapers" still has very important and very fresh significance for us today: "... we still use very few vivid and concrete examples and models from all aspects of life to educate the masses, and this is the main task of the newspaper in the transitional period from capitalism to socialism."
    I carefully studied the essay "On News in Newspapers" in Anshan. When I clearly realized that "it is one of the most important tasks of the newspaper (referring to Pravda) to systematically and comprehensively explain the life of all union republics, states, regions, major industrial centers and cultural centers in the country. ... It is the basic task of every correspondent of the newspaper," what my eyes touched and my ears heard felt like lively, educational, and moving news materials everywhere, and I no longer felt dry and tasteless. I believe that articles on summaries like experiences and lessons learned should be written by the actual working organs and responsible persons, and the reporter's responsibility is only to assist the editorial department in organizing or urging them to write it out immediately. This allows us to learn with the greatest energy and time to "deeply and convincingly show the events and phenomena in our boiling reality," to learn to "use concrete facts to show the embodiment of the party's slogans in life, or to show the reasons hindering this embodiment." This is the reporter's duty, and this is how the reporter's function can be fully realized.

　　把生活反映到报纸上来
    学习《论报纸上的消息》笔记
    王坪
    《论报纸上的消息》一文所论列的每一件事，都是任何一个新闻工作者所经历过或者正在经历着的。所以读来使人感到具体、细致、亲切、启发性很大、帮助很大。
    过去我们也曾经做过业务总结，但由于没有钻到工作的细小环节里去，总难免泛泛而谈；有时甚至把一些关键性的具体事件错认为是不值一谈的“琐事”而抛出总结以外，例如该文中的六、七两节——“报纸上的错误的来源”和“编辑部对稿件的检查”所说到的记笔记、校正姓名、电话传稿、对照原稿等等，都是属于我们过去所不愿把精力化费在上面的“琐事”。然而，“致命的混乱”、“使作者和报纸都窘住了”的各种各样的错误，就是从这些被人忽视的“琐事”中产生的。“错误是赶急、轻率、自慰的结果”，我们把一些自己认识得不准确和不正确的事，看成是不值得重视的“琐事”，正是一种典型的轻率，一种典型的自慰，因而使我们多出了很多应该避免和可以避免的错误。以我个人来说，多带几枝铅笔这样的业务经验是早就有了的，但一直把它当作小事而未认真做到，以致在最近还犯了一次过失：为了记录一次重要谈话，我的自来水笔墨水用光了，便向我访问的对方——一位负责同志——借他的自来水笔使用，一不小心，掉到地板上，把笔头碰歪了，弄得大家都很窘迫。
    关于新闻的时间性，本来是不成问题的问题，“新闻”这两个字的本身便包含着强烈的时间性。但至今仍有不少新闻工作者局限于农村习惯，把它看成“小事”，认为只要在政策上无问题便万事大吉。他不知道，正确掌握政策，是完全必要而且是基本的方面，但在使用新闻这武器宣传政策和反映政策时，如果能够及时就更有效果、更有力量。“在一个会议开幕两三个星期后才写关于该会议的东西，到底有什么意思呢？……应该非常严格地遵守稿件的新鲜性的要求。”这确实值得忽视新闻的时间性的新闻工作者密切注意。我们对于很多读者所反映的：“这事已经过去很久了怎么才登报呢？”的批评常常是冷淡的，这是不正确的态度。
    我们要钻到业务的深处，搜寻容易发生错误的细小的环节，改进和加强我们不成系统的、半生半熟的新闻业务。这是我学习《论报纸上的消息》的第一个强烈的启发。
    第二个强烈的启发是我们过去和今天，都太忽视用“活生生的例子”，用“生活的逻辑”、“事实的逻辑”作为报道的内容了。“我们还很少对工厂、乡村、部队生活的日常方面加以注意”。（列宁：《论我们报纸的性质》）新闻总署在去年十月廿三日所发的“关于加强实际工作报道的指示”中指出：“至于有关实际工作动态的新闻，则十分稀少。”新闻总署要我们“除了报道一般政治动态外，必须经常地有系统地，反映和指导劳动人民的生活和斗争。”由此可见，忽视活生生的事例的报道现象是很严重的。
    造成这一现象的原因，我检讨出下面的一点：
    我觉得：有一种脱离具体条件的思想在我们之中存在着。这就是我们常常孤立地去“钻问题”，去写经验教训的文章，认为这样的文章才有“指导”意义。没有认识到“消息在其本质上就是实用的”，每一件具体事实的本身就有逻辑，我们要是把事实的本身恰当地反映出来，“事实的逻辑”便是教育。有了那种脱离具体条件的业务思想，必然地忽视甚至轻视报道活生生的具体事实，便不能不停滞在采访“嘴”（与负责同志谈谈）及采访“文件”（看看总结之类）的阶段而无法和不愿深入，因而写出来的东西便难免是甲、乙、丙、丁，一、二、三、四等干巴巴的一套。我们不善于“用社会主义建设的（在今天的中国来说，便是新民主主义建设。下同。——作者）活生生的例子来教育劳动者”、“从社会主义建设的活生生的具体事实中，让读者看见共产主义思想的胜利。”我们还不善于“将事实选择得使其自己能够为我们、为我们的事业而发出呼喊。”列宁在一九一八年“论我们报纸的性质”中所讲的话，今天对于我们还有着非常重要、非常新鲜的意义：“……我们还很少用生活各方面的生动的具体的榜样和模范去教育群众，而这正是报纸在从资本主义到社会主义过渡时期的主要任务”。
    我仔细学习《论报纸上的消息》这篇论文是在鞍山，当我明确地认识到“有系统地和全面地阐明全国各加盟共和国、各州、各边区、各大工业中心与文化中心的生活，是该报（指真理报）最重要的任务之一。……是该报每一个通讯员的基本任务”时，我的视线所触，听觉所及，觉得到处都是生动活泼、富有教育意义、令人感动的新闻材料，再也不感到干枯、无味了。我认为把写经验教训之类的总结文章，请担任实际工作的机关和负责人去写，记者的责任只是协助编辑部组织或督促他们即时写出。这就可以以最大的精力和时间，学会“深刻而令人信服地表明我们沸腾着的现实中的事件和现象”，学会“用具体事实表明党的口号在生活中的体现，或表明阻碍这一体现的原因”。这才是记者的职责所在，这才能充分发挥记者的职能。
