　　Regarding "Over-Age League Members"
　　Reply from the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League to Bao Liangqing

To the Editor:
　　Recently, our company transferred a group of cadres from Shanghai. Among them are several members of the New Democratic Youth League who are twenty-eight or twenty-nine years old. At the time, I thought they might be League friends, but the introduction letter clearly stated that they were formal League members. After detailed discussions with them, I learned that the Shanghai Youth League stipulates that comrades over twenty-five years old can join as over-age League members. I don't understand why the East China region's admission of League members is different from the regulations in the League Constitution. Can the North China region also do this? If not, what rights should existing over-age League members enjoy? I hope to receive a reply.

Comrade Bao Liangqing:
　　We have forwarded your question to the Organization Department of the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League for a reply as follows:

　　The League Constitution stipulates that the age for joining the League is from fourteen to twenty-five years old (calculated according to actual age).

　　Over-age League members are treated as individual special cases under special circumstances due to work needs and with the approval of the League Committee at or above the county level. It is not a general rule, and it cannot exceed three years beyond the age stipulated in the League Constitution (i.e., not exceeding the actual age of twenty-eight). This is to maintain the basic characteristic of the Youth League organization – youthfulness.

　　The reason Shanghai does this is that the liberation of the area was relatively late, and the work foundation in many places was poor. In order to carry out the work, some over-age League members were absorbed.

　　The powers of over-age League members, as stipulated in the League Constitution, include the right to speak and the right to be elected, while when elected into guiding organs, they still have the right to vote and the right to decide.

　　关于“超龄团员”
    团中央组织部答鲍良卿问编辑同志：
    最近我们公司从上海调来一部分干部，其中有几个新民主主义青年团员，但年龄都在二十八九岁。当时我认为可能是团友，但介绍信上却明明写的是正式团员。经我和他们详谈，才知道上海青年团规定二十五以上的同志可加入为超龄团员。我不了解为什么华东区吸收团员与团章规定的不一样呢？华北区是否也能这样作？如不能的话，现有的超龄团员应享什么权利呢？希答复为盼。

    鲍良卿同志：
    你的问题已经我们转请中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会组织部答复如下：
    团章规定，入团年龄为十四岁以上至二十五岁以下（按实足年龄计算）。
    超龄团员是在特殊情况下，由于工作需要，并经过县级以上团委批准，作为个别的特殊问题处理，不是一般的规定，而且不能超过团章所规定年龄的三岁（即不超过实足年龄二十八岁）。这是为了保持青年团组织的基本特点——青年性。
    上海之所以这样作是因为该地解放较晚，很多地方工作基础较差，为了开展工作，吸收了一些超龄团员。
    超龄团员之权力按团章规定有发言权与被选举权，而在被选入指导机关时，则仍有选举权与表决权。
