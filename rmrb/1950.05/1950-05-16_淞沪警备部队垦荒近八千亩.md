Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 13th -- Since December of last year, the Shanghai-Songhu Garrison troops have reclaimed 6,238 mu of wasteland up to early April of this year. Including the wasteland reclaimed from August to November of last year, the total reclaimed land has reached 7,906 mu, and more than 1,348,000 jin of vegetables have been harvested.

The garrison troops used the experience and achievements of wasteland reclamation from August to November of last year to prove that agricultural production can also be carried out in cities. Since then, all units have further carried out education, mobilization, and organization to universally launch the wasteland reclamation movement. To adapt to the special circumstances of large cities, various units have widely used small plots of wasteland in and around Shanghai to cultivate crops. In addition, production teams of 50 to 100 people were formed on a regimental basis to find wasteland for reclamation in the suburbs with the assistance of the local government. In the area within a hundred li centered on Shanghai, the troops have designed nearly 30 farms of 50 to 200 mu each. These lands are mostly barren land that has been abandoned for many years, and the regiments and higher-level organs have signed usage contracts with the local government.

In terms of sideline production, the garrison troops have raised 3,495 pigs and sheep, and produced more than 1,853,000 jin of tofu and bean sprouts. Since late February, the troops have also enthusiastically participated in some national construction and municipal construction work, and have participated in a total of more than 94,000 workdays up to late April.

　　淞沪警备部队垦荒近八千亩
    【新华社上海十三日电】淞沪警备部队自去年十二月以来，截至今年四月上旬止，开垦荒地六千二百三十八亩；连去年八月至十一月所垦荒地计算在内，已垦荒地达七千九百零六亩，并收获菜蔬一百三十四万八千多斤。
    警备部队以去年八月至十一月的开荒经验和成绩，证明了在城市中也可以从事农业生产。自此以后，各单位就进一步进行教育、动员、组织，使开荒运动普遍展开。为适应大城市的特殊情况，各单位广泛地利用了上海市内和边缘的小块荒地来垦种。另以团为单位组成五十人到一百人的生产队，经过当地政府的协助，到市郊去找荒地开垦。在以上海市区为中心的周围一百里的地区内，部队已设计了五十亩至二百亩不等的农场近三十处。这些土地大都是荒弃多年的瘠地，并由团以上机关与当地政府签订了使用合同。
    副业生产方面，警备部队已养猪、羊三千四百九十五头，磨豆腐、生豆芽达一百八十五万三千多斤。自二月下旬以来，部队并热烈地参加了一些国家建设和市政建设工作，截至四月下旬止，共参加九万四千多个工。
