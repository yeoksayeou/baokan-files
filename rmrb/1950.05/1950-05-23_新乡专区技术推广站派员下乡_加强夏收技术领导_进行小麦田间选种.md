The Xinxiang Special District Technology Promotion Station Sends Personnel to the Countryside
Strengthen Technical Leadership in Summer Harvesting and Conduct Wheat Field Seed Selection
[This newspaper's Xinxiang dispatch] In order to strengthen technical leadership in summer harvesting and conduct wheat field seed selection, the Xinxiang Special District Agricultural Technology Promotion Station of Pingyuan Province dispatched nine of its promoters to counties such as Wuzhi, Wenxian, and Xiuwu to assist farmers in seed selection work. Wheat yellow dwarf disease is quite prevalent in this special district, with annual yield reductions of about 10% in most areas. Therefore, the leaders of the special district attach great importance to seed selection work. Before the promoters went to the countryside, they received special education on seed selection work, pointing out that the purpose of seed selection is to prevent and control diseases and insect pests and increase wheat production in the next year. Good seeds that are free of or have less yellow dwarf disease, high yield, plump grains, suitable for local soil and climate, and recognized by the masses are the targets for seed selection. In promoting seed selection, it is necessary to use vivid examples familiar to the local masses to educate them. In organizing seed selection, more attention should be paid to promoting the organization of technical guidance groups in various counties, absorbing experienced old farmers and women to participate, and spreading seed selection techniques to the masses. In the seed selection and seed exchange policies, attention should be paid to equal value, voluntariness, and mutual benefit, mobilizing every household to select good seeds in the fields. If they do not have good seeds in their own fields, they can help good seed households select seeds, harvest them separately, and then exchange them at equal value, ensuring that good seed households do not suffer losses and are happy to exchange. This is an important link in striving to popularize good seeds in five years. Before the trip, the promoters unanimously expressed that they would resolutely go deep into the masses, learn from the old farmers, and overcome all difficulties to complete the task.

　　新乡专区技术推广站派员下乡
    加强夏收技术领导  进行小麦田间选种
    【本报新乡讯】平原省新乡专区农业技术推广站，为了加强夏收技术领导，进行小麦田间选种，派遣该站九名推广员，分赴武陟、温县、修武等县，协助农民进行选种工作。该专区小麦黄疸病相当普遍，大部地区每年减收约在百分之十左右，因此专区领导上对选种工作极为重视，在推广员下乡之前，曾专门进行了选种工作的教育，指出选种工作的目的，是为了防除病虫害，增加下年度小麦产量。凡没黄疸或黄疸少，产量大，籽粒饱满，适合当地土质气候，群众公认的好种籽，就是选种对象。在宣传选种上，要多用当地群众熟习的生动例子教育群众。在组织选种上，要多注意推动各县组织技术指导小组，吸收有经验的老农与妇女参加，把选种技术推广到群众中去。在选种、换种政策上，要注意等价、自愿、两利，发动家家户户到地里选好种。如自己地里没有好种，可帮助好种户选，单打单收以后，再去等价交换，要保证良种户不吃亏，乐于交换。这是争取五年普及良种的重要一环。行前，推广员们均一致表示，坚决深入群众，向老农学习，不怕一切困难完成任务。
