	Railway Engineering Corps First Detachment Heroically Repairs
	Luoyang River Great Iron Bridge Reopened to Traffic
	It is the longest-spanning steel bridge in the country, interrupted for ten years, and revived today.
	[This newspaper report] The Luoyang River Great Bridge on the Longhai Railway, the longest-spanning in the country, was repaired and opened to traffic on April 7. Construction of the bridge began in 1910 and was completed in 1912. It was a nine-hole Pratt-style steel beam bridge, 317.6 meters long. In 1928, it was modified into a seven-hole steel beam bridge due to damage to the bridge foundation. It was blown up by the Kuomintang army in 1940. Although it has been repaired many times by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang in the past ten years, it has never been successful. After liberation, the bridge brigade of the First Detachment of the Railway Engineering Corps was ordered to repair the bridge, and officially started construction on January 18, 1950. The soldiers overcame numerous difficulties and modified it into a five-hole bridge with a total length of 257.5 meters in 74 days, which was fully completed on April 6. It was 55 days ahead of the original plan and saved 14,100 workdays.
	During the project to repair the bridge, the soldiers worked selflessly. They worked hard to learn technology and fought against various difficulties. In more than two months, they learned various complex technologies of bridge engineering and emerged countless touching heroic deeds. When the six five-ton trestles buried in the water could not be lifted by cranes, 95 soldiers lifted them to the site by manpower. In the dead of winter, their hands were frozen stiff, and sometimes tools fell into the river. The soldiers jumped into the icy water without hesitation to pick up the tools and prevent the slightest loss of state property. On cold snowy nights, the cadres took off their coats and draped them over the bridge workers who came from Hengyang, Shanhaiguan, Fengtai and other places to assist in the work. Each engineering team worked one after another, and no one wanted to rest because their hands and feet were frozen. The Party branch used gaps in the project or rest time to carry out activities on the spot. Blackboards and fast clappers became very active in the company, encouraging the soldiers' confidence. Soviet engineering expert Bagnov arrived at the construction site on February 4 and put forward suggestions on construction methods, labor organization, and other aspects, which played an important role in completing the task ahead of schedule.
	On the afternoon of April 7, the "Construction" locomotive covered with flowers pulled twelve freight cars through the Luoyang River Bridge. The local people stood on the mountains, by the river, on the ferry boats..., and bursts of applause and cheers resounded throughout the sky. The Luoyang River steel bridge, which had not been repaired for ten years, was revived under the heroic efforts of the People's Railway Engineering Corps.

　　铁道兵团一支队英勇抢修
    洛河大铁桥修复通车     
    它是全国跨度最长的钢桥，中断十年，今日复活。
    【本报讯】全国跨度最长的陇海线上的洛河大桥，已于四月七日修复通车。该桥于一九一○年开始修建，一九一二年落成。为英国普拉特式九孔钢梁大桥，全长三一七·六公尺。一九二八年因桥基毁坏，改修为七孔钢梁桥。一九四○年被国民党军炸毁。十年来虽经日寇及国民党多次兴修，始终没有成功。解放后，铁道兵团一支队桥梁大队奉命修复该桥，于一九五○年一月十八日正式开工。战士们突破重重困难，以七十四天的时间，改修为全长二百五十七点五公尺的五孔大桥，于四月六日全部完成。较原计划提前五十五天，节省了一万四千一百个工。
    在修复该桥的工程中，战士们忘我地劳动着。他们努力学习技术，向各种困难搏斗。他们以两个多月的时间，学会了桥梁工程的各种复杂技术，并涌现了无数可歌可泣的英雄事绩。当那六座埋在水里的五吨重的排架，用吊车抬不起来的时候，九十五个战士竟用人力把它们抬到现场。在三九天，手被冻僵了，工具有时脱落到河水中，战士们奋不顾身，跳进冰水，把工具拾起来，不让国家财产有丝毫损失。在严寒的雪夜，干部们脱下自己的大衣，披到从衡阳、山海关、丰台等地赶来协助工作的修桥工人身上。各个工程小组一个赶一个的进行着工作，谁也不愿意因为寒冷冻麻了手足而休息。党的支部利用工程空隙或休息时间，在现场进行活动。黑板报、小快板在连队中十分活跃起来，鼓舞着战士们的信心。苏联工程专家巴格诺夫于二月四日到达工地，提出了有关施工方法、劳动组织等多方面的建议，在提前完成任务中起了重要作用。
    四月七日下午，披满鲜花的“建设”号机车牵引着十二辆车皮，通过洛河大桥。当地的群众站在山头上、河边上、渡船上……，响起漫天遍地的掌声和欢呼声。十年来没有修复的洛河钢桥，在人民铁道兵团的英勇努力下复活了。
