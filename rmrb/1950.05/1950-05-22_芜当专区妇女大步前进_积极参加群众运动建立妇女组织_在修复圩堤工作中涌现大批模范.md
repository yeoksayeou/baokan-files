　　【Report from this newspaper in Dangtu】Since liberation, the broad masses of working women in the Wudang Special District of southern Anhui Province have actively participated in mass movements and production and disaster relief work in various periods. A large number of activists have emerged, improving the social status of women, and women's work has also been widely carried out. According to statistics from April, women's organizations have been established in 704 out of 811 villages in the four counties of Nanling, Fanchang, Wuhu, and Dangtu, and the number of women's association members has reached 78,520.

　　Shortly after the liberation of Wudang Special District, it was hit by the severe floods of June and July last year. The disaster was very serious throughout the special district, except for some mountainous areas in Nanling and Fanchang. At that time, undesirable phenomena such as husbands selling their wives and adults selling children (mostly girls) occurred frequently. The People's Government and the Communist Party immediately led the masses to carry out production and disaster relief movements, and vigorously mobilized women to participate in production, which stabilized the disaster situation and began to correct the old society's ideas of belittling women. In the disaster relief work, diversified sideline production was carried out according to the principle of "relying on the mountains to eat the mountains, and relying on the water to eat the water." For example, Nanling, Fanchang and other counties organized women to open up mountains to grow vegetables, chop firewood, spin, and boil saltpeter; Wuhu, Dangtu and other counties organized women to catch fish and reclaim wasteland, solving the lives of some disaster victims. In organizing women's production, care was also taken for poor households lacking labor. In addition to the government allocating relief grain, many women also launched mutual aid and mutual relief movements, proposing slogans such as "relatives help relatives, neighbors help neighbors," and "ten families help one family, ten people help one person" to save on disaster relief. According to statistics from Nanling, Fanchang, and Dangtu counties, more than 7,000 kilograms of mutual aid grain were raised to relieve poor disaster victims. Before the end of last year, the Wudang Special District used work as a form of relief to repair embankments. The total number of remaining dilapidated embankments to be repaired in the entire district was about 17.7 million cubic meters of earthwork. In this work, various places broke the past thinking that women's participation in labor was shameful and the folk saying that "women can't build strong embankments" through seminars, mass meetings, and women's representative meetings. With the lead of women cadres and activists, a large number of women were mobilized to repair embankments together with men. According to preliminary statistics, there were 33,947 women participating in embankment repairs in the entire special district, and a large number of women became models for embankment repairs. For example, women accounted for 43 of the 180 embankment repair models in Mapu Embankment in Lugang District, Wuhu County; Yang Deying, a female embankment repair model in the first embankment of Dangtu, was able to carry 4.4 cubic meters of soil a day, and was admired by all the embankment workers. After the start of spring plowing this year, many women participated in field work and organized farming teams to farm for the families of embankment workers and poor households lacking labor, so that the workers could work on embankment repair with peace of mind. At the same time, the women also launched a campaign to weave straw sandals to comfort the workers, weaving more than 23,000 pairs of straw sandals in total, which gave the embankment workers great encouragement.

　　In last year's grain requisition work, many women actively took the lead in delivering public grain and assisted the government in investigating "black fields." Women in only three villages, such as Zhucun in the seventh district of Nanling, found more than 700 mu of "black fields." In the anti-despot movement, women became one of the main forces against feudalism. Statistics show that women participating in the anti-despot struggle accounted for more than one-third of the total number of women. For example, when Nanling struggled against the big despot Huang Fanya, more than a dozen women cried out at the mass meeting about Huang Fanya's past crimes, which stirred up the atmosphere of struggle in the entire venue. In areas where Kuomintang special agents and bandits were active, women in many villages organized anti-bandit groups to assist in suppressing bandits. For example, Wu Fengying, a woman from Zhiben Township, Pudian District, Wuhu, assisted the government in seizing two machine guns and two rifles hidden in the water by bandits. Zhu Lanxiang, a woman from Nanling, discovered a disguised Kuomintang special agent, and both were rewarded and commended by the government.

　　In addition, women in many areas have also organized cultural classes, night schools, literacy classes and other learning organizations, and actively participated in learning. Some illiterate women have already learned two or three hundred characters.

　　芜当专区妇女大步前进
    积极参加群众运动建立妇女组织       
    在修复圩堤工作中涌现大批模范
    【本报当涂讯】皖南区芜当专区的广大劳动妇女，解放后一年来积极参加了各个时期的群众运动和生产救灾工作，涌现了大批积极分子，提高了妇女的社会地位，妇女工作也获得广泛开展。据四月份统计，南陵、繁昌、芜湖、当涂四个县八百十一个村中，已有七百零四村建立了妇女组织，妇女会会员已发展至七万八千五百二十名。
    芜当专区解放不久，即遭遇了去年六、七月的大水灾。全专区除南陵、繁昌部分山区外，灾情都很严重。当时曾普遍发生丈夫卖妻子、大人卖小孩（多是女孩）等不良现象。人民政府和共产党马上领导群众开展了生产救灾运动，并大力发动妇女参加生产，稳定了灾情，也开始纠正旧社会轻视妇女的思想。在救灾工作中，根据“靠山吃山、靠水吃水”的原则，开展了多样的副业生产。如南陵、繁昌等县组织了妇女开山种菜、打柴、纺织、熬硝；芜湖、当涂等县组织了妇女捉鱼、开荒，解决了一部分灾民的生活。在组织妇女生产中，并照顾缺乏劳动力的贫苦户，除政府拨发救济粮食之外，许多妇女又发动了互助互济运动，提出“亲帮亲、邻帮邻”，“十家帮一家，十人帮一人”等节约救灾口号。据南陵、繁昌、当涂三县统计，共募集了七千余斤互助粮食，救济了贫苦灾民。去年年底前，芜当专区以工代赈修复圩堤，计全区残缺待修的圩堤共约一千七百余万土方。在此一工作中，各地通过座谈会、群众会、妇女代表会等方式，打破过去妇女以参加劳动为耻辱和民间流传的“妇女上圩圩不牢”等轻视妇女劳动的思想，在妇女干部与积极分子带头之下，发动了大批妇女与男子一道修圩。据初步统计，全专区参加修圩妇女有三万三千九百四十七名，大批妇女并成为修圩模范。如芜湖县鲁港区麻浦圩修堤模范一百八十名中，妇女占四十三名；当涂第一圩的修圩模范妇女杨德英，一天能挑土四点四方，为全圩民工所敬仰。今年春耕开始后，许多妇女参加了田间耕作，并组织了代耕队为修圩民工家属及缺乏劳动的贫苦户代耕，使民工能安心修圩。同时，妇女们还发起了编织草鞋慰劳民工运动，计共织草鞋二万三千余双，给修圩民工以很大的鼓舞。
    在去年的征粮工作中，许多妇女积极带头交送公粮并协助政府清查“黑田”。仅南陵七区朱村等三个村的妇女，就查出了“黑田”七百余亩。在反恶霸运动中，妇女们成为反封建的主力军之一，统计全区参加反恶霸斗争的妇女，占妇女总人数的三分之一以上。如南陵斗争大恶霸黄范亚时，有十几名妇女在群众大会上哭诉黄范亚过去的罪恶，激动了全场的斗争情绪。在国民党特务、土匪活动的地区，许多村的妇女组织了防匪小组协助剿匪。如芜湖濮店区植本乡妇女吴凤英，协助政府缴获了土匪藏匿在水里的机关枪和步枪各两支。南陵妇女朱兰香查获了一名化装国民党特务，均受到政府的奖励与表扬。
    此外，不少地区的妇女还组织了文化班、夜校、识字班等学习组织，积极参加学习。有的文盲妇女已认识了二、三百字。
