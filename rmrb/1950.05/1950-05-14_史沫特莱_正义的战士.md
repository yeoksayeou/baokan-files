Agnes Smedley - A Warrior for Justice
　　Yang Gang
　　I met Agnes Smedley in the spring of 1933. At that time, she and I were walking on a road in Shanghai, heading to a factory in western Shanghai. Her upper body leaned forward, bobbing up and down, and she walked quickly and powerfully, like a young, strong worker wielding a mattock to dig the earth. I could hardly keep up with her. She said, "Can't you walk? The children of the rich have never known how to walk!" It was the first time I had met her. Hearing those words, I was both angry and uncomfortable, thinking, what a rude old woman.
　　More than a decade later, I accidentally flipped through a magazine and read a passage about Agnes Smedley. It was about an incident involving her in the New Fourth Army. I don't remember the details very clearly. It seems enemy planes were attacking, and the headquarters ordered her to evacuate immediately. They couldn't find her where she was staying, so the people looking for her ran to the hospital. They found her standing at the door like a door god, angrily refusing to leave, determined to move everything that each patient should have prepared, and only after every patient had left would she leave that place.
　　These two incidents show Agnes Smedley at her best. She had a natural and righteous hatred for the oppressed classes, and she never concealed or disguised this hatred. This was consistently manifested in her words and deeds. At the same time, in direct contrast to this hatred, she had a maternal, selfless love for her class brothers and sisters. This righteous love and hatred constituted the source of Agnes Smedley's life of courageous struggle, a struggle to the death.
　　For twelve years after our first meeting, I didn't really have the chance to meet her again, except for seeing her occasionally at banquets. But I often heard and read about her dedication to her work in China. The Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army were fighting internal and external enemies everywhere, on mountain tops and in valleys, on plains and in streams. Agnes Smedley took pride in being able to share their extraordinary hardships and difficulties. No matter how difficult the revolution was, her confidence in the success of the Chinese revolution never wavered. Whenever people asked her about the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, her eyes would pierce the questioner, forcing those British and American adventurers who just wanted to hear sensational stories to straighten their faces and listen to everything she had to say. Because she had integrated her whole being with the people's struggle, she became a natural and powerful propagandist for the people. Many British and American people only began to humbly seek to understand the great strength of the Chinese people's revolution and the righteous source of this strength after going through her. Even old fox imperialists like the British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr during the Anti-Japanese War were influenced by Agnes Smedley. People with a sense of justice, such as Joseph Stilwell and Evans Carlson, were even more drawn to the people's revolution because of her. In 1946, when the United States and Chiang Kai-shek launched a full-scale civil war in China, Stilwell wrote a letter to Agnes Smedley, excitedly saying: "I really want to run to the Northeast, carry a gun, and fight those low-down seeds with Zhu De." Carlson himself admitted that he had been an imperialist adventurer, but since he came into contact with the Eighth Route Army and Agnes Smedley repeatedly explained to him the historical justice possessed by this army and its leaders, he regretted his past mistakes and started anew. Carlson was a people's fighter until his death, and he once expressed his desire to join the Communist Party. Here, Agnes Smedley turned the Chinese people's righteous struggle into a common stance for outstanding American children. No American could have done this work except for American communists.
　　I saw Agnes Smedley again in the United States in 1945. Although we were essentially just acquaintances who had met once, she treated me as if I were a relative. At that time, she was very poor (she was always poor). Her books sold a lot of money, but she gave it away in large sums. At that time, the progressive, basically Communist Party-led National Citizens Political Action Committee, the Arts, Sciences, and Professions Workers Association, and the Far Eastern Democratic Policy Promotion Association were all the recipients of her donations. At the same time, after returning from China, she spent more than a year treating her illness, and the money was completely gone. Out of desperation, she went to Yaddo to live as a dependent. Yaddo was a place donated by several tycoon bosses, mainly the New York Times, as a place for literary workers to rest and work, providing them with food and lodging. The original intention was certainly not to take in people like Agnes Smedley. But after she went there, she used her irresistible charm and her talent for propaganda to influence a group of outstanding professors and students in several local universities, uniting them around her. At the same time, she also influenced the manager of Yaddo, a woman with a very conservative nature, to invite more progressive literary workers to Yaddo as much as possible and to avoid those who were obviously reactionary. She herself used this opportunity to write a biography of Commander-in-Chief Zhu while organizing small groups of the National Citizens Political Action Committee among the surrounding farmers. She invited the local branch of the American Communist Party and American Communist Party members working in the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) to these farmer groups, professor and student groups to give reports and participate in discussion work. She also ran to the CIO branch to report on the Chinese issue, mobilizing them to discuss and donate money. In 1945 and 1946, the American people still had a fairly widespread demand for progress and opposition to regression, inheriting the legacy of the anti-fascist war. Imperialist reactionaries and war-mongers did not dare to be openly arrogant. Therefore, the people in charge of Yaddo not only dared not suppress Agnes Smedley's actions but were happy to follow her and hang a progressive sign themselves to attract more people. Later, as the situation deteriorated, Yaddo's reactionary style was exposed day by day. They not only gradually tightened their grip on Agnes Smedley in terms of life but also secretly interfered with and monitored her actions. Finally, they openly demanded that Agnes Smedley stop her activities among the farmers, saying that she was secretly colluding with the Communist Party and spreading communism. According to her character, Agnes Smedley could not learn to do underground work. She lodged a serious protest with the reactionary authorities in Yaddo, and then she packed her bags and left for New York without saying goodbye.
　　When she was in Yaddo, she didn't have to worry about food and lodging. Expenses such as buying books, traveling, and donating money were provided by her own speeches and ticket sales. In fact, it was not enough. It had long been difficult to find a market for her articles in the United States. After leaving Yaddo, she was extremely distressed, and she could not live with people for long, often having to move around. Her diet was even more terrible. Green vegetables and bread were considered a meal. Sometimes she borrowed food, but she was unwilling. But whenever the Far Eastern Democratic Policy Promotion Association launched a fundraising campaign, such as a one-dollar-a-bowl-of-rice movement, she would take out that one penny as long as she had it in her hand. On the contrary, that spy and traitor Anna Louise Strong hoarded many of her writings and the money she sold by betraying the people, accumulating rubles in the Soviet Union in preparation for her to enjoy them when she went to the Soviet Union, and using dollars to build large real estate in the United States, with villas on both the East and West Coasts. The villa in New York was located on the Hudson River, which has the best scenery and the most expensive real estate in New York. When the spy exposed her true colors and had nowhere to live, and many Americans who were as white as water and so-called progressives still wanted to quibble for her, Agnes Smedley disregarded her personal friendship and criticized Strong and broke off contact with her.
　　When I left New York, she had already moved again, living with an elderly couple in the countryside of New York, growing vegetables, writing books, and giving speeches. She boasted about the vegetable seeds she had mixed herself and distributed the vegetables to her friends. She grew these vegetables to compensate the elderly couple for the food and lodging they provided her. She also went to the mountains and fields every day to pick some wild fruits to help with meals. She said, "This time I can probably stay longer." But in reality, she knew that the days she could live in the United States were extremely limited. By the autumn of 1948, the war cries and war preparations of the American imperialist reactionaries were becoming more and more rampant. The Atlantic Pact, which was preparing for large-scale human slaughter, had already been launched. The issue of denouncing the American Communist Party as traitors had been put on the agenda of Congress several times. The arrest of the twelve leaders of the American Communist Party was being plotted. The Mundt-Nixon Bill was already being discussed. On the reactionary list of organizations prepared by the reactionaries, all the organizations that Agnes Smedley had participated in, especially the Far Eastern Democratic Policy Promotion Association, had been listed. Agnes Smedley, who shared the fate of the American people, was well aware of her situation. She discussed with her friends whether to stay in the United States or come to China. Because she simply could not live in the United States and could not hide to avoid the clutches of the enemy, and she could no longer play any role in the United States, her friends advised her to prepare to come to China. It was impossible for her to get an American passport. But if she went to England in name, she might be able to get out of the country. This was her situation when I left the United States.
　　For more than a year, the great historical victory of the Chinese people has shattered the entire strategic plan of imperialism, fundamentally crushed the conspiracy of imperialism to restore full control over colonies and semi-colonies, and exposed all their positions in the colonies, making them face the attack of the powerful forces of the people. This situation forced them to jump over the wall in desperation and had to more frantically suppress the people. Therefore, the progressive movements of the American people and the leaders in these movements could not but be pursued and arrested by them, and Agnes Smedley became even more of a target. In order to deal with Agnes Smedley, MacArthur did not hesitate to personally come forward and slander her as an international spy, so that if she was unwilling to bow her head and be slaughtered by the imperialist jackals, she would have to leave that dark country ruled by war-mongers, money kings, and secret agents and flee to England. She had no love for England ruled by reactionaries. Her purpose was to pass through there to China and continue to participate in the Chinese people's struggle against imperialism. However, unfortunately, her wishes could not be fulfilled. She died in England, where she did not want to stay!
　　The daughter of a miner, she has lived her life as a battle for fifty years, and she has taken serving the people as her food. Work wore her down, the persecution of the enemy wore her down, and the hardship and poverty made her worn body unable to resist frequent illnesses. She was always in battle and always sick. At fifty-three years old, people should not die in general, but for Agnes Smedley, death was possible at any time.
　　She is dead. A great fighting woman is dead! She is not without shortcomings. Her shortcomings are big shortcomings, but her advantages are also big advantages. This advantage lies in the fact that she always and everywhere, from beginning to end, stood with the people without fear, and waged a solemn and courageous struggle against the enemy.
　　Agnes Smedley! You live among us and will always be our great and faithful friend! (Attached picture)

　　史沫特莱——正义的战士
　　杨刚
    我认识史沫特莱是在一九三三年春天。那时我和她在上海马路上走着，要到沪西一家工厂里去。她上身向前，一栽一栽，走得又快又有力，好像一个年青有力的工人在挥动鹤嘴锄挖土似的。我有些追不上她。她就说：“你走不动？有钱人的儿女向来是不会走路的！”当时我是第一次见她。听了这话又气又难受，想这婆子怎么这样无礼。
    过了十几年，我偶然翻一本杂志，读到书中一段关于史沫特莱的文章。文章是关于她在新四军中的一件事。情形记得不很真确了。好像是敌机来袭，司令部下令要她紧急疏散。在她住的地方找她不着，找她的人就跑到医院里去。发现她像门神一样怒冲冲的当门站着，死不肯走，定要把每一个病人所应准备的一切都搬走，和每一个病人都走完了，她才肯离开那个地方。
    这两件事表现史沫特莱是最到家的了。她有一种被压迫阶级的自然而正义的仇恨，她绝不肯把这种仇恨隐瞒或掩饰起来。这是在她的言语行为之中一贯地表现着的。同时，正与这种仇恨相对照，她对于阶级弟兄又有一种慈母的忘我的热爱。这种正义的爱与恨构成了史沫特莱一生勇猛战斗，战斗到死的生命源泉。
    从第一次会见她之后有十二年之久，除偶然在宴会上看见她以外，没能真正和她再见面过。但常常听见并且读到她在中国献身工作的事迹。八路军和新四军在山顶山洼，平原溪谷，到处打击内外敌人。他们超绝人寰的劳苦和困难，史沫特莱都以能够分担为荣。无论革命是在怎样困难的情形之下，她对于中国革命成功的信心从来不曾动摇。逢人问到八路军新四军她总是两眼锋棱逼射对方，使那些原来不过是想听新奇故事的英美冒险家不得不整肃容颜来听她所要谈的一切。由于她把全身全心和人民的战斗打成一片了，因此她就成了一个天生的，强有力的人民的宣传家，不少英美人士只是由于经过她，才开始来虚心的要求了解中国人民革命的伟大力量以及这种力量的正义的根源，甚至如抗战中的英大使卡尔那种老狐狸帝国主义分子，都受了史沫特莱的影响。有正义感的人士如史迪威、卡尔逊则因此更加倾心于人民革命。一九四六年美蒋发动中国全面内战时，史迪威致史沫特莱一封信中曾激动的说：“我真是想跑到东北去背一根枪和朱德一起跟那些下流种子们作战。”卡尔逊自己承认本是一个帝国主义冒险家，但是，自从他和八路军接触之后，又经史沫特莱反复对他说明这支军队及其领袖们所拥有的历史的正义，他就痛悔前非，从头做人。卡尔逊到死是一个人民的战斗员，他曾经表示过他想参加共产党。在这里，史沫特莱把中国人民正义的战斗变成了美国优秀儿女的共同立场，这一个工作是除了美国共产主义者以外，没有任何美国人能够做到的。
    一九四五年我在美国再度见到了史沫特莱。虽然实质上不过是仅有一面之缘的相识，可是她好像见到了亲人一样。那时候，她非常穷困（她向来是穷的），她的书卖了很多钱，可是她大把的输捐。当时美国进步的，基本上在美共领导下的全国公民政治行动委员会，艺术、科学职业工作者协会，远东民主政策促进会都是她捐款的对象。同时她从中国回去之后，经过一年多时间治病，钱是完全光了。不得已，她到雅都庄（Yaddo）去依人为活。雅都庄是以纽约时报为主的几个财团老板捐来作为文艺工作者休憩工作的地方，供他们食宿。本意当然不是为了收容像史沫特莱这样的人物。可是她去了以后，就运用她那不容易抗拒的吸引人的魔力和她宣传的天才，影响了当地几个大学里一部分优秀的教授和学生，把他们团结在自己的周围，同时她又影响雅都的经理，一个保守性极重的女人，要她尽量邀请较进步的文艺工作者去雅都，而避免要那些显然反动之流。她自己运用这种机会，一面写朱总司令的传记，一面又在周围农民中间组织全国公民政治行动委员会的小组。她邀请美共在当地的支部以及在产联中工作的美共党员到这些农民小组、教授及学生们的小组中去作报告，并参加讨论工作。她并且自己跑到产联的支会里去报告中国问题，发动他们讨论和捐款。一九四五、四六两年，美国承反法西斯战争的余绪，人民要求进步反对倒退的要求还是相当普遍。帝国主义反动派和战贩们还不敢公然嚣张。因此雅都当事人对于史沫特莱的行动非但不敢加以压迫，反而乐于跟着她，自己也挂上进步的招牌以广招徕。后来形势日非，雅都的反动作风也就一天天暴露。他们非但在生活上对史沫特莱渐渐扣紧，并且对她的行动暗中干涉、监视。最后竟公然要求史沫特莱停止在农民中的活动，说她暗中与共产党勾结，宣扬共产主义。史沫特莱按着她的性格，不可能学习作地下工作，她对雅都反动当局提出了严重抗议，之后就卷了铺盖，不别而去了纽约。
    她在雅都的时候，食宿自己不用过问，用度如买书，旅行，捐款，则靠自己出外演讲卖票来供给，事实上是不够的。她的文章在美国久已不容易找到销路。离开雅都之后，困苦万分，借住人家也不能长久，时常要搬来搬去。饮食更是一塌糊涂，青菜面包就算一顿，有时借食，她又不愿意。可是每当远东民主政策促进会发动捐款，比如一碗饭一元钱运动等，只要她手上有一文钱她就拿出那一文。反之那个间谍叛徒史特朗却把她的许多著作以及出卖人民所卖的钱，是卢布就积存在苏联，以备她去苏联时享用，是美元就在美国大置房地产，西岸东岸都有她的别庄。在纽约的别庄则在纽约风景最好、而房地价最贵的赫贞河上。及至间谍暴露了自己的面目，无地容身，美国许多白水一样的所谓进步者们还在想为她狡辩时，史沫特莱却不顾私人友谊对史特朗加以指责，并和她断绝了来往。
    我离开纽约的时候，她已经又搬了家，借住在纽约乡下一对年老夫妇那里，自己种菜、写书、演讲。她很夸耀她自己所配的菜种，并把菜分送给她的朋友们。她种这份菜用意是拿来补偿那对老夫妇所供给她的食宿费用，她又每天到山野里去摘些野果来作助餐。她说：“这回我大概可以住长久一些了。”可是实际上她明白她在美国能够住下去的日子是极其有限了的。到一九四八年秋，美帝国主义反动派的战争叫嚣和战争准备是越来越嚣张了。准备大规模人类屠杀的大西洋公约已经发动，诬蔑美国共产党为叛国犯的问题已经数次提上了国会的议程，拘捕美共十二领袖的事正在阴谋中，蒙特法案已经在讨论，在反动派准备的团体黑名单上凡史沫特莱所参加的团体，尤其是远东民主政策促进会，都已列名。与美国人民同命运的史沫特莱十分明白她的处境，她和朋友们商量究竟是留在美国还是到中国来。因为她在美国简直是无法生活，而又无法掩蔽以避开敌人的魔掌，她在美国已经不能够起什么作用，朋友们就劝她准备来中国。美国护照她是不可能拿到的。但是她如果以赴英为名，可能得到出境。这是我离开美国时她的情况。
    一年多以来中国人民伟大的历史性的胜利打垮了帝国主义的整个战略计划，从根本上粉碎了帝国主义企图恢复对殖民地半殖民地全盘统治的阴谋，并且把他们在殖民地的阵地全部暴露，使之面对着人民强大力量的攻击。这种形势逼得他们狗急跳墙，不得不更加疯狂的镇压人民。因此，美国人民的进步运动以及这些运动中的领袖们就不能不为他们所追逐逮捕，而史沫特莱也就更加变成了他们的箭靶。为了对付史沫特莱，麦克阿瑟不惜亲自出马，谰诬她是国际间谍，使她若不愿甘心低头，受帝国主义豺狼们的宰割，就只有离开那个被战贩、财王、特务所统治的黑暗国土向英国出亡。她绝无所爱于被反动派所统治的英国。她的目的是想经过那里到中国来，继续参加中国人民反对帝国主义的斗争。可是，不幸，她的志愿不能达到，她死在她所不愿停留的英国了！
    矿工的女儿的她，五十年来把战斗当作生命，把为人民服务当作她的食粮。工作磨损了她，敌人的迫害磨损了她，艰苦贫困更使她被磨损了的身体抵抗不住经常的疾病。她经常在战斗也是经常在生病的。五十三岁一般人不应该死，可是在史沫特莱却随时都有死的可能。
    她死了。一个伟大的战斗的女人死了！她不是没有缺点的。她的缺点是大的缺点，但她的优点也是大的优点。这优点就在于她随时随地自始至终绝不畏缩的和人民站在一起，对敌人作庄严而勇猛的斗争。
    史沫特莱！你活在我们中间，永远是我们伟大而忠实的友人！（附图片）
