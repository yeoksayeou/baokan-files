　　Voices of the Readers
    Comrade Ji Luo of the Political Department of the Southern Jiangsu Military Region's Zhan You Bao (Comrade-in-Arms News) pointed out an omission in the last issue of this journal's "Catalog of Chinese Translations of Works by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin": The translated title of Stalin's "On the Chinese Revolution" by Shi Zhi should be "Stalin on the Chinese Revolution," which belongs to the "Excerpt Compilation."
    Bian Qian comrade from the western suburbs of this city criticized the book "Ci Yuan" (published by Shanghai Qingguang Bookstore), saying that its content is not as the book's advertisement claims, "drawing on the strengths of many," and "incorporating both new and old vocabulary." Entries like "May 21st Incident," "February 7th Massacre," "March 8th (International Women's Day)," and "December 9th Movement" are not included. Under the entry "Liangshanbo," it says, "Song bandit Song Jiang gathered bandits and built a stronghold here"; under the entry "Border Region Government," it says, "a government established by the Chinese Communist Party in the past to secede the northwestern border region." This demonstrates the irresponsibility of the book's editors and publishers.
    Xiao Zhao comrade from Zaoqiang County, Hebei Province, criticized the "Four-Corner Code Small Dictionary" (published by Commercial Press), saying that although it has been adapted after liberation, it still does not have a correct political stance and retains many errors.
    Huang Zhen comrade from Nanshi, Shanghai, said: Shanghai Times Publishing House recently published a translation of Hilferding's original work "Finance Capital." Hilferding's theory is a theory of imperialism, which Lenin once severely criticized. He questioned why the publishing house is printing such a book at this time.
    A Bao Guang Bookstore reading group wrote: The domestic publishing industry is currently flourishing, but some publishers, due to insufficient political and cultural standards, often present readers with books and periodicals that are not very good. The financial loss to readers is a small matter; the most unacceptable thing is that their minds will be poisoned. We believe that the publication of "Book Review" is very meaningful, but doing so is not enough. We suggest that you immediately find ways to connect with progressive publishers across the country, read all the new books published each month, and then publish the results. It is not necessary to review each book in detail; you can also adopt a list format... (Editor's note: This idea is very good, but due to the limitations of our manpower, we cannot do it for the time being. We will strive to achieve it in the future.)

　　读者之声
    苏南军区政治部战友报社吉罗同志指出上期本刊《马、恩、列、斯著作中译本目录》的疏漏：什之译斯大林《论中国革命》，书名应为《斯大林论中国革命》，属《摘录编辑》。
    本市西郊边谦同志批评《辞渊》（上海青光书店出版）一书说，内容并不如该书广告中所说“博采众长”，“新辞旧辞一律兼收并蓄”，像“马日事变”、“二七惨案”、“三八节”、“一二九运动”等条目，都没有收进去。在“梁山泊”条下，说“宋剧盗宋江啸聚结寨于此”；在“边区政府”条说是“中共过去割据西北边境建立的政府”。足见该书编辑出版者的不负责任。
    河北枣强县小赵批评《四角号码小辞典》（商务印书馆出版）解放后虽经改编，但仍然没有正确的政治立场，留着许多错误。
    上海南市黄振同志说：上海时代书局新近出版希法亭原著《金融资本论》译本，希法亭的理论是帝国主义的理论，曾经列宁痛斥过，责问该书局为什么在现时印行这样的书。
    宝光书店读报小组来信说：目前国内出版业颇见蓬勃发达，但有些出版业者，因政治水准及文化水准不够，常常把内容不很好的书刊，送到读者面前，读者金钱上的损失还是小事，最要不得的是思想上会受到毒害。我们认为《图书评论》的编刊是很有意义的，但这样做尚嫌不够。我们建议，你们立即设法跟全国进步出版业者连系起来，把每月出版的新书，都看一遍，然后将结果刊登出来，不必每书详细评论，采取列表的形式亦可……（编者按：这意思很好，但我们由于人力的限制，一时还不能做到，以后我们当努力来实现。）
