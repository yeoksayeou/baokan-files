　　Thoroughly Eliminate Feudal Remnants:
    Yangquan Coal Mine Vigorously Opposes the "Ba Tou" (Foremen) System
    Production Efficiency of the Fourth Mine Has Reached Unprecedented Levels
    [Yangquan Special Dispatch by Our Newspaper Reporter] Reporter Lin Li reports: The anti-"Ba Tou" struggle in the state-owned Yangquan Coal Mine is being vigorously carried out. After the publicity and preparation stage in early April, the public opinion to abolish the "Ba Tou" system has penetrated every corner of the entire mine. Many workers said: "People have come from Beijing, people have come from the province, and people have come from the special district. We absolutely must strike down those blood-sucking lice!" The workers' morale is extremely high. Worker Wang Changmao and others, with great confidence, dragged the group leader to the trade union to settle wage accounts; the sixty-year-old Hao Lairren, holding a little grandson, went to ask for wages for his son; workers who had suffered from the exploitation of the "Ba Tou" went to the work team to complain and accuse the "Ba Tou" of illegal acts.
    In the anti-"Ba Tou" struggle, the workers' enthusiasm has been raised, and production has increased. Some people believe that production cannot be improved without the "Ba Tou." This doubt can be dispelled. In the early part of this month, it was a period of ideological preparation for the anti-"Ba Tou" struggle in the Yangquan Mine. At that time, the number of workers at the Fourth Mine was 2,709 per day, the daily coal output was 1,424.895 tons, and the average production efficiency of the entire mine was 0.526 tons. On the 11th, when the movement began, from the 11th to the 15th, the average number of workers reached 3,147 per day, the daily output suddenly increased to 1,903.638 tons, and the production efficiency increased to 0.6046 tons. The above figures far exceed the average figures for March.
    At the beginning of the movement, some "Ba Tou" began to change. Those who used to point fingers and did not go down the mine have now begun to work down the mine. Things like collecting membership fees, evaluating wages, and increasing or decreasing people are all discussed with the workers, and some have even automatically reduced their one or two meters of subsidies. However, some "Ba Tou" not only do not honestly bow their heads to the workers, but instead coerce the workers and resist the mine. When the Mining Bureau transferred workers to training classes for training, on the one hand, they prevented the workers designated by the trade union from going, and at the same time, they attempted to send their own henchmen to beat people. Worker Song Suojin expressed his firm support for the anti-"Ba Tou" opinion at the workers' meeting on April 12. That night, he was hit by the team leader who refused to "hang a sign" (that is, not recording work, not being able to receive wages). Two team leaders under the group leader Wang Laquan occupied more than three hours of work time, privately gathered workers in the well to hold a meeting, forced people who had made suggestions to Wang Laquan to speak, and encouraged workers to follow Wang Laquan to private coal mines. The workers' enthusiasm for struggle was greatly affected.
    Why did the above phenomenon occur? In the early stage of the movement, the leadership overemphasized "preventing the left" and did not adopt a firm and decisive policy of "complete abolition." The movement to raise workers' awareness by complaining was also regarded as a "rural method that cannot be moved"; seeing the workers shouting a few slogans at the meeting, they repeatedly called it "left," thus binding the cadres' thinking and restricting the full mobilization of the workers.
    In order to overcome the above deviations, fully mobilize the masses of workers, and complete the great revolution in the coal mine management system, the anti-"Ba Tou" system working committee of the mine specifically convened a meeting on April 16, announcing the abolition of the group leader system. It was clearly pointed out that the group leader system after liberation is essentially the "Ba Tou" system and should be resolutely abolished in accordance with the circular of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry. At the same time, it was decided that the concentrated "Ba Tou" should be dispersed to various work areas according to the severity of their crimes, to participate in labor and await disposal; the group leaders who have not been concentrated will no longer be concentrated and await disposal. The team leaders are dealt with according to three different situations: first, for teams such as contracting teams, the work nature and relationship with the workers of the team leader are the same as the past "Ba Tou" and the current group leader, and should be treated as "Ba Tou". Second, general team leaders, and "Ba Tou" henchmen, secretaries, etc., although they bullied the workers, they were hired by the group leader and handled according to the "appointment personnel" method stipulated by the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry. Third, for teams such as construction teams, the team leader works with the workers and has no economic exploitation relationship, and should be treated as workers. As for the "Ba Tou" personnel above the level of captain and section chief, they generally do not have direct economic relations with the workers after liberation, and their work belongs to the nature of administrative management. Although they are from "Ba Tou" origin, they should be treated as administrative management cadres. The meeting also decided to mobilize workers to elect temporary production team leaders by democratic election, and after movement tests and administrative review and approval, they will become formal production team leaders. After the above measures were stipulated, Wang Laquan, who instigated the team leader to sabotage the anti-"Ba Tou" struggle, has been handed over to the People's Court for handling at the request of the masses. Various mines have entered a tense struggle to promote the new and eliminate the old.

　　彻底肃清封建残余
    阳泉煤矿热烈反把头           
    第四矿生产效率已空前提高
    【本报阳泉专讯】记者林里报道：国营阳泉煤矿的反把头斗争正热烈开展中。经过四月上旬的宣传酝酿准备阶段，废除把头制的舆论已深入全矿各个角落。许多工人说：“京里来人了，省里来人了，专区也来人了。那伙吸血的虱子，可非打倒不可了。”工人情绪极高。工人王长毛等，理直气壮的拉上大组长到工会去算工资账；六十多岁的郝来任老汉，拉着一个小孙孙，去替儿子要工钱；饱受把头压榨的工人们，纷纷找工作队诉苦，控告把头的非法行为。
    在反把头斗争中，工人的积极性提高了，生产量增加了。有些人认为离了把头不能搞好生产，这种怀疑可以打破了。本月上旬，是阳泉矿反把头斗争的思想酝酿时期。当时，第四矿每天到班工人为二千七百零九名，日产煤一四二四·八九五吨，全矿平均生产效率为○·五二六吨。十一日运动开始，从十一到十五日，每天平均到工人数三千一百四十七名，日产量突增为一九○三·六三八吨，生产效率提高到○·六○四六吨。以上数字，远远超过三月份的平均数字。
    在运动开始之初，部分把头即开始转变。过去指手划脚不下井的，现在已开始下井劳动了。像收会费、评工资、增减人等事情，都和工人商量商量，有的甚而将一两米的津贴费自动减去了。然而也有些把头不仅不老老实实向工人低头，反而威逼工人和抵抗矿方。当矿务局抽调工人到训练班受训时，他们一方面阻止工会指定的工人去，同时企图派自己的爪牙打人。工人宋锁金在四月十二日的工人大会发表了坚决拥护反把头的意见，当晚就遭到小组长不给“挂牌子”（即不给记工，不能领工钱）的打击。大组长王拉全手下的两个小组长，占用了三个多钟头的做工时间，私自在井下集合工人开会，逼问给王拉全提意见的人，并鼓动工人跟着王拉全往私营煤矿跑，工人的斗争积极性，很受了一些影响。
    为什么会形成上述现象呢？在运动初期，领导上曾经过分强调“防左”，没有采取坚决果断的“彻底废除”的方针。把提高工人觉悟的诉苦运动也认为是“不能搬运的农村方式”；看见工人在大会上喊两句口号，也连声叫“左”，因此束缚了干部思想，限制了工人的充分发动。
    为了克服上述偏向，充分发动工人群众，完成煤矿管理制度上的大革命，该矿反把头制工作委员会，特于四月十六日的会议上，召开会议，宣布取消大组长制。并明确指出：解放后的大组长制，实质上就是把头制，应坚决遵照中央燃料部的通令，彻底废除。同时决定：把集中起来的把头，按罪恶大小分散于各个工作间，参加劳动，听候处理；未集中起来的大组长不再集中，听候处理。对小组长，则根据三种不同情况处理：一是包车等组，小组长的工作性质、同工人的关系，均与过去的把头、现在的大组长相同，应以把头论。二是一般小组长，和把头爪牙、书记等，他们虽然欺压工人，但为大组长所雇佣，按中央燃料部所规定的“任用人员”办法处理。三是修建等组，小组长和工人一起劳动，并没有经济剥削关系，应以工人相待。至于队长、股长以上的把头人员，解放后一般和工人没有直接的经济关系，他们的工作属于行政管理性质。他们虽系把头出身，但应按行政管理干部处理。会议同时决定以民主选举方法，发动工人选举临时生产小组长，经运动考验，与行政审查批准后，即为正式生产组长。是项办法规定后，唆使小组长破坏反把头斗争的王拉全，已在群众要求下送交人民法院处理。各矿已进入推陈出新紧张的斗争中。
