Xinhua News Agency, 11th. To standardize commonly used translated terms in academic and publishing circles, the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council, after extensively soliciting the opinions of experts, has formulated a "Preliminary Plan for the Work of Standardizing Academic Terminology" and decided to establish a "Committee for the Standardization of Academic Terminology." The committee will be chaired by Guo Moruo, with Ding Xielin, Zhu Kezhen, Pan Guangdan, Ai Siqi, Jian Bozan, He Cheng, Lei Jieqiong, Shen Zhiyuan, Xu Songming, Yang Zhongjian, Wang Ziye, Jiang Tianzuo, Ji Jianbo, Shao Quanlin, and Xia Kangnong as members. Under the committee, five working groups will be temporarily set up for natural sciences, social sciences, medicine and health, current affairs, and literature and art, which will be the responsibility of the Academy of Sciences, the General Administration of Publications, the Ministry of Health, the News Administration, and the Ministry of Culture, respectively, and experts will be invited to serve as reviewers. Regarding the principles of terminology review, the "Preliminary Plan for the Work of Standardizing Academic Terminology" stipulates that commonly used translations that are already customary and have no inappropriateness should be retained as much as possible; old translations that are obsolete and inappropriate need to be changed, and new translations need to be added, and the opinions of relevant theoretical workers and practical workers should be widely solicited, and submitted to various sub-groups for discussion. New terms should avoid being obscure and difficult to understand, but transliterations of internationally used terms may also be appropriately adopted.

　　文教委员会制订方案
　　审订统一学术名词
    【新华社十一日讯】为统一学术界、出版界常用的翻译名词，政务院文化教育委员会在多方征集专家的意见后，已制订“统一学术名词工作的初步方案”，并决定设立“学术名词统一工作委员会”。该委员会由郭沫若为主任委员，丁燮林、竺可桢、潘光旦、艾思奇、翦伯赞、贺诚、雷洁琼、沈志远、徐诵明、杨钟健、王子野、蒋天佐、纪坚博、邵荃麟、夏康农为委员。在委员会下暂设自然科学、社会科学、医药卫生、时事、文学艺术五个工作组，分别由科学院、出版总署、卫生部、新闻总署和文化部负责，并邀请专家担任审订工作。关于名词审订的原则，在“统一学术名词工作初步方案”中规定尽量保留已习惯流行而并无不合的译名；其陈腐不妥的旧译名需要更改者及新译名需要增添者，应广泛征求有关的理论工作者和实际工作者的意见，并交各分科小组讨论。新名词应避免古僻难懂，但国际通用名词的音译亦可适当地采用。
