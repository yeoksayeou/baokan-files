Huairou's Cui Chen personally came to this newspaper to complain
　　Local government detains people and cuts down trees
    Hoping the Tong County Commissioner's Office will promptly investigate and deal with it
On the 11th of this month, Cui Chen, a farmer from Gengxinzhuang, Third District, Huairou County, Hebei, personally came to this newspaper to complain about the detention of her son, Cui Zili, by the district and village cadres there. The following is the transcript of her complaint:
    "My family has five members and originally had thirty-one mu of land. Because the land there is very poor, during the land reform last year, my family's thirty-one mu of land was converted into eight mu and eight fen, and we were also allocated two mu and four fen (converted into one mu and two fen). My family was classified as poor peasants. There is a village cadre in our village named Wang Guang, and his land is next to my family's land. On the twenty-first day of the first lunar month this year, Wang Guang wanted to open a road on my family's land to the east. That piece of land was originally my family's garden, with trees and a shed for stacking firewood. At that time, I didn't let him open the road there. Wang Guang asked me to produce the documents, but the documents were lost during the flood in the 28th year of the Republic of China. On the twenty-first day of the first lunar month, Wang Guang and other village cadres, along with the village head An Changshou, marked the area on my land and were about to open the road. On the twenty-second day, I went to the district, and the district chief wrote a letter asking me to take it to the district cadre Meng Qingyu who lived in the village. The district chief's letter said that Wang Guang should not open the road, and if he wanted to open it, he should compensate with land, and asked Meng Qingyu to mediate properly. But Meng Qingyu threw the letter away without reading it. He said they would open the road tomorrow, saying that I had no documents and that he would send me to the county government. On the twenty-fourth day, the village militia captain and squad leader took three militiamen to send my son to the county for detention. On the twenty-sixth day, I went to the district, and the district chief said he was busy and didn't see me. I immediately rushed to the county government. The guard said that I had just come yesterday, and I couldn't see him today. If I wanted to see the district chief, I had to bring something. Later, I happened to meet someone from my mother's family at the market, so I asked my mother's family for ten jin of rice to send to them. They took the rice but still didn't let me see him. On the twenty-eighth day, I went to the district again and asked the district to issue a letter of introduction to the county government to see my son. The district party secretary and the district chief both said they didn't care because I didn't have any documents and wouldn't give me a letter of introduction, telling me to find a way to go to the county government myself. That day, I went to the county government again, and I went there again on the third day of the second lunar month, but they didn't let me in. On the twenty-sixth day of the second lunar month, I asked someone to write a letter and took it to the county government. A staff member who received me said, "You came just in time! If you haven't made any mistakes, why would we arrest you? Have you paid the public grain you owe?" They used the public grain we owed to make things difficult for us. When I handed in public grain last autumn, I owed four hundred and eighty-six jin of public grain, but my village wasn't the only one that owed public grain. I owed public grain because of the flood last year, and a total of fifteen families in the village owed public grain. At that time, the government allowed us to postpone the payment until the autumn harvest this year.
    "On the twenty-eighth day of the second lunar month, led by Meng Qingyu, together with village head An Changshou, village cadre Cui Jiuxiang, and Wang Guang, they sawed down one elm tree and three poplar trees in my garden. That day, I hadn't returned from the county, and my daughter-in-law tried to stop them from sawing, but they beat her unconscious. Later, the village women's group rescued her. My daughter-in-law is pregnant, and she has been sick since they beat her, and she hasn't recovered yet. In addition to sawing down the four trees in my garden, they also sawed, cut, and took away all the trees in my field (a total of forty to fifty trees of various sizes). They also took away a donkey from my daughter-in-law's family. Even if I owe public grain, they shouldn't have taken so many things from my family and my relatives' families! On the fifteenth day of the first lunar month this year, I wanted to sell the four trees in my garden to pay public grain, and I had already sold them (for five hundred jin of millet), but the village head wouldn't let me sell them. Why are they sawing my trees now?
    "In our village, it is common for the village head and village cadres to detain and beat people. I hope the government will send someone down to investigate as soon as possible and see how to deal with it."
Editor's Note: After listening to Cui Chen's statement, we immediately sent a reporter to the village to investigate. According to preliminary understanding, although the situation described by the local district and village cadres differs from what Cui Chen said, the following facts can be confirmed: Because Cui Chen's family was in arrears with public grain, the county government did detain her son and notified the district government to cut down and sell the trees of her family to offset the public grain. In addition to continuing to investigate and study, we also request the Tong County Commissioner's Office to investigate and deal with it as soon as possible and tell us the results.

### 怀柔崔陈氏亲来本报诉述　当地政府扣人砍树事件　望通县专署从速调查处理

　　怀柔崔陈氏亲来本报诉述
　　当地政府扣人砍树事件   
    望通县专署从速调查处理
    本月十一日，河北怀柔县第三区耿新庄的一位农妇崔陈氏，亲来本报申诉该处区村干部扣押她的儿子崔自立的事情。下面就是她的申诉的笔录：
    “我家现有五口人，原有三十一亩地。因为我们那里土地都很坏，去年土地改革时，我家的三十一亩地折成八亩八分，此外又分给我家二亩四分（折成一亩二分）。给我家划的成份是贫农。本村有个村干部王广，他的地和我家的地靠在一起。今年阴历正月二十一，王广要在我家东面地里开道。那块地原来就是我家园子，上面种有我家的树，还有我们堆柴火的架子。当时我就不让他在那里开道。王广叫我拿出文书，但是文书在民国二十八年发大水时丢失了。正月二十一日，王广和其他村干部，还有村长安长寿，在我的地上划了样子，就要开道。我在二十二日到了区上，区长写了封信叫我拿给住在村里的区干部孟庆余。区长的信说王广不该开道，如果要开就要拿地来补，叫孟庆余好好调解。但是孟庆余把信扔了不看。他说他们明天就要开道，说我无文书，并说要把我送县政府。到二十四日那天，村里民兵中队长和小队长就带着三个民兵将我儿子送往县里扣押起来。二十六我到了区上，区长说没工夫，没见到。我立即又赶到县政府。站岗的说昨天才来，今天就见，不成，要见区长就得拿东西来。后来我在集上刚好碰到我娘家的人，就向我娘家要了十斤米送去。他们拿了米还是不让见。二十八日我又上区，请区上开个介绍信上县政府看看我儿子。区委书记、区长都说不管，因为我没文书，不给我开介绍信，叫我自己到县政府去想办法。当天我又到县政府去，二月初三又去一趟，都不让进去。二月二十六我找人写了封信拿到县政府。接见我的一个工作人员说：“你来了正好！你们没有错误，怎么会抓你们啦？你欠的公粮交了没有？”他们拿我们欠公食来为难我。去年秋天交公粮时，我欠了四百八十六斤公粮，但村里欠公粮的不只我一家呀。欠公粮是因为去年水淹，村里欠公粮的一共有十五家。那时是经政府允许延期到今年大秋补缴的。
    “阴历二月二十八，由孟庆余带头，会同村长安长寿、村干部崔九祥、王广，将我园子里一棵榆树三棵杨树都锯了。那天我在县上还没回来，我儿媳妇挡着不叫锯，被他们打得昏了过去，后来村里妇女小组把她救回来。我儿媳妇正怀着身子，被他们打了以后就病着，现在还未好。他们除锯了我园子里的四棵树以外，又把我地里的树（大小一共四、五十棵），锯的锯，抅的抅，都通通弄走了。此外还拉了我媳妇娘家的一头驴子。就说我欠公粮，也不该弄走我和我亲戚家的那么多东西呀！今年正月十五，我要把我园里的四棵树卖了交公粮，当时已卖妥了（五百斤小米），但村长不叫卖。为什么他们现在要来锯我的树？
    “在我们村上，村长、村干部扣人、打人是常事。我希望政府赶快派人下去调查，看看该怎么处理。”
    编者按：我们听了崔陈氏的陈述后，即派记者到该村调查。据初步了解，当地区村干部所说情况与崔陈氏所说的虽有不同处，但以下事实是可以肯定的：因崔陈氏家拖欠公粮，县政府确将她的儿子扣押，并通知区政府砍卖她家的树木折缴公粮。我们除继续调查研究外，并要求通县专署从速调查处理，并将结果告诉我们。
