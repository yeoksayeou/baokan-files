Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 5th: The rapid development of industry in Northeast China over the past year has resulted in initial improvements in the people's livelihood.

	Last year, the actual income of workers in state-owned enterprises in Northeast China increased by 27%, and the state's expenditure on labor insurance and various welfare measures reached about 10% of the total wage bill. The number of workers in private industrial enterprises in Northeast China also increased by 18% last year.

	Last year, materials for social consumption accounted for 26% of the total industrial output value in Northeast China, which considerably satisfied the increasing needs of the people of Northeast China for industrial finished products, thereby reducing the difference between the prices of agricultural products and the prices of industrial products. Taking the grain-cloth exchange ratio as an example, the grain price at the end of last year was twice as high as that in the winter of the year before last. In other words, the amount of cloth that farmers had to exchange with two "shi" of grain in the winter of the year before last could be exchanged with one "shi" of grain at the end of last year. This also increased the purchasing power of farmers.

	Due to the rapid development of industrial production, prices in Northeast China have been relatively stable over the past year. In 1948, the average price increase in Northeast China was eight times, but in 1949, the average increase was only 80%. This has ensured the stability of the people's lives in Northeast China.

	According to the plan of the Northeast People's Government, the production value of consumer goods will account for 21% of the total output value of state-owned industries in Northeast China this year, and the actual quantity will increase by about 40% compared with last year. This will help further improve the lives of the people in Northeast China.

　　工业迅速发展物价相对稳定
    东北人民生活改善     
    职工实际收入增加农民购买力亦提高
    【新华社沈阳五日电】东北工业在过去一年中的迅速发展，已使人民生活获得初步改善。
    去年东北国营企业职工的实际收入，已增加了百分之二十七，而国家为劳动保险和各种福利的措施而支付的经费又达到工资总额百分之十左右。东北私营工业工人的数目，在去年一年中，也增加了百分之十八。
    去年东北工业生产总值中，属于社会消费的资料共占百分之二十六，相当地满足了东北人民对工业成品日益增大的需要，从而减少了农业品价格与工业品价格的差额。以粮布交换比值为例，粮价在去年末即比前年冬提高一倍，也就是说，前年冬农民要以两石粮食所换的布，去年末以一石粮食即可换得。这也就提高了农民的购买力。
    由于工业生产的迅速发展，东北物价一年来已达到相对稳定。一九四八年东北全境的物价平均上涨八倍，但一九四九年则平均仅上涨百分之八十。这就保证了东北人民生活的安定。
    按照东北人民政府的计划，今年东北国营工业的生产总值中，属于消费资料的生产价值，将占百分之二十一；其实际数量则比去年约增百分之四十。这将有助于东北人民生活的进一步改善。
