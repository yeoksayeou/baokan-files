Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 17th: The Tianjin Banking Joint Syndicate began granting loans to private production enterprises in Tianjin after signing a business cooperation contract with the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank of China on the 4th of this month. As of the 13th, the syndicate has successively loaned a total of 6 billion yuan to three factories, Yongli Chemical Company, Yaohua Glass Company, and Zhongtian Motor Factory, to assist each factory in purchasing raw materials and carrying out production. The syndicate also intends to grant a loan to Jiuda Refined Salt Company at the end of this month in response to the company's application. Several medium-sized factories that have recently applied for loans from the syndicate are also under review by the syndicate's executive committee. According to the provisions of the business cooperation contract signed between the syndicate and the People's Bank of China, the minimum loan amount for the syndicate this month is 6.56 billion yuan, and the amount of loans issued has now reached 90 percent of this figure. Due to the continued increase in deposits from syndicate members and the feeling that loans through the syndicate are relatively safe, the total amount of loans issued this month is expected to exceed the original minimum loan amount.

    开始对私营工厂贷款           
    本月贷出款项将不下六十五亿
    【新华社天津十七日电】天津市银行业联合银团自本月四日与人民银行天津分行签定业务联系合同后，对津市私营生产事业贷款业已开始。截至十三日，该银团已先后贷给永利化学公司、耀华玻璃公司、中天电机厂等三厂共六十亿元，协助各该厂购买原料，进行生产。该银团并拟应久大精盐公司之申请，于本月底对该厂贷款一笔。近日向该银团申请贷款的几个中型工厂，也正由该团干事会审核中。按照银团与人民银行签定业务联系合同的规定，银团本月份最低贷款金额为六十五亿六千万元，现已贷出款项已达此数的百分之九十。由于参加银团的会员存款续有增加，同时感觉经由银团贷款比较安全，故本月份贷出计款项预将超过原定之最低贷款金额。
