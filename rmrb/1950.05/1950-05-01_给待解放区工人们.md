　　To the Workers in the Unliberated Areas
　　Fellow workers in the unliberated areas:

　　More than a year after the liberation of Beijing, we at the Beijing Workers' School have launched a campaign to pour out our grievances. With tears in our eyes, we are pouring out our bitter experiences. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, we have become masters of our own house! Today, we dare to tell our fellow workers about our past suffering and to denounce the crimes of the reactionary forces. When one of our comrades recounted how his whole family was forced out of work by the Japanese imperialists after the September 18th Incident, unable to maintain a livelihood and forced to flee into the interior, our eyes filled with tears of pain as we thought of you, far away under the iron heel of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, the running dogs of imperialism, living the same life we lived on the eve of liberation. You are still suffering, you are still in pain, you are still being oppressed, you are still being slaughtered; you are still waiting for liberation in suffering!

　　Dear brothers and sisters! We hope that as liberation draws near, you will grit your teeth, protect the machines, protect the factories, and cooperate with the people's army to liberate yourselves. Brothers and sisters, we are here supporting you, we are using all our strength in production to support the front and liberate all of China.

　　Dear brothers and sisters! The complete liberation of all of China is not far off. Let us, the workers of the whole country, unite and jointly build our new China!

　　给待解放区工人们待解放的工人兄弟姐妹们：
    在北京解放后一年多的今天，我们北京职工学校展开了诉苦运动。我们流着眼泪，倒出我们的苦水，我们在共产党领导之下，当了家了，作了主人了！今天敢于向我们的工人阶级弟兄诉说我们过去的痛苦，控诉反动势力的罪恶。当我们一个同志诉到他们全家在九一八以后，被日本帝国主义逼的失了业，无法维持生活，流入关内的时候，我们满眼含着痛泪，想念起你们远在帝国主义的走狗蒋介石匪帮的铁蹄之下，过着和我们解放前夜一样的生活；你们还在受罪，你们还在受痛苦，你们还在受压迫，你们还在受屠杀；你们还在苦难中等待着解放！
    亲爱的兄弟姐妹们！希望你们在快要解放的时候，咬紧牙关，保护机器，保护工厂，配合人民的军队，解放你们自己。兄弟姐妹们，我们在这里支持你们，我们把我们所有的力量用在生产上以支援前线，解放全中国。
    亲爱的兄弟姐妹们！全中国的彻底解放已经不远了。让我们全国工人兄弟们，团结起来，共同建设我们的新中国！
