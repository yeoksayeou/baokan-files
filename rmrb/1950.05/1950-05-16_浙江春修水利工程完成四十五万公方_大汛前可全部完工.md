The Jinhua Lake seawall irrigation and hydropower project has reached 64% completion. In addition, the large-scale farmland water conservancy project at Huqiao Steep Gate in Yongjia has now completed dredging the river channel and is proceeding with the foundation work of the sluice gate. It is expected that the above-mentioned unfinished projects will be fully completed before the major floods in June and July. Various small-scale farmland water conservancy projects, which are managed by farmers themselves and supported by loans from the Provincial People's Government, have now completed over 60% to 70%. According to incomplete statistics from the six special districts of Jiaxing, Quzhou, Lin'an, Shaoxing, Jinhua, and Taizhou, over 5,400 dikes and dams have been built and repaired. The Ningbo Special District had already completed over 60% of small-scale farmland water conservancy projects in March, and the benefited farmland will reach over one million mu upon completion. The Shaoxing Special District expects to complete all small-scale farmland water conservancy repairs before rice transplanting. In areas where water conservancy has been successfully improved, farmers' confidence in increasing grain production this year has greatly increased.
