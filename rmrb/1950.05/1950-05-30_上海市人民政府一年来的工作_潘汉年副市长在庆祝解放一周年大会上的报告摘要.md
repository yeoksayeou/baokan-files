Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 28th. Excerpts from Vice Mayor Pan Hannian's report on the Shanghai Municipal People's Government's work over the past year, delivered at the Shanghai People's Anniversary Celebration of Liberation.

　　Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the staff of the Municipal Government strictly adhered to discipline and steadily progressed. Within two months of the liberation on May 28th last year, they had essentially completed the task of taking over. However, the victorious liberation of Shanghai also brought about developing difficulties: the enemy began a blockade of Shanghai, production stagnated, the speculative market had not yet been eliminated, prices continued to fluctuate, and some short-sighted people, due to a lack of clear understanding of the temporary nature of the difficulties in the midst of victory, developed pessimistic and disappointed sentiments. At the First People's Representative Conference, Comrade Rao Shushi of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party delivered a report entitled "Struggling to Smash the Enemy's Blockade and Build a New Shanghai," which clearly pointed out that it was necessary to resolutely eliminate illusions about imperialism and firmly resolve to independently and autonomously transform old Shanghai in order to overcome difficulties. The conference adopted six major tasks: supporting the southward advance of the army, changing the future production policy and development direction of Shanghai, developing inland transportation, and encouraging the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas.

　　Executing Six Major Tasks and Achieving Great Success

　　After the first and second sessions of the People's Representative Conference, the Municipal Government led and united the people of the city in carrying out the six major tasks and conducting the struggle against blockade and bombing, achieving great success: (1) After the liberation of Shanghai, the enemy attempted to suffocate Shanghai's economy through blockade and bombing. However, the People's Government, with unwavering determination, used all its strength to maintain and restore necessary industry and commerce. The People's Government promoted the organization of joint public-private operations and joint transportation to solve the problems of raw materials and sales, and used methods such as loans, orders, and purchases to solve the difficulties of some private enterprises lacking working capital. (2) Due to the severe floods last year, a large number of refugees fled from the disaster areas to Shanghai, coupled with the indiscriminate bombing of Shanghai by bandit planes, resulting in an even more serious situation. Faced with this reality, the government, despite financial difficulties, still used great strength and funds to carry out relief work. By November of last year, the Shanghai Disaster Relief Organization had allocated 60 million catties of grain, and used the method of work relief to build more than 200 li of sea dikes in the Subei Cotton Reclamation Area, which can protect more than 2.4 million mu of cotton fields, and can newly reclaim more than 2.2 million mu of cotton fields. From July of last year to March of this year, the Shanghai Municipal Government sent back to their hometowns for production or to participate in the construction of sea dikes a total of about 350,000 refugees. (3) On February 6th of this year, US-made bandit planes indiscriminately bombed Shanghai, causing significant damage to the lives and property of citizens. Two-thirds of the power generation equipment of the Shanghai Electric Power Company was destroyed. However, after the united efforts of workers, engineers, technicians, and the People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the People's Government to actively repair it, by the 15th of the same month, the company's original power generation capacity had recovered 65%, enabling the lives of citizens and all industries to be maintained. The People's Government further organized the people of the city to carry out effective air defense work. (4) Under the leadership of the Central People's Government and the East China Military and Political Committee, the Shanghai Municipal People's Government has ensured the supply of daily necessities to the people of Shanghai. For decades before liberation, Shanghai relied on large imports of foreign rice to solve the people's needs. Before liberation, the price of rice in Shanghai rose several times a day. After liberation, Shanghai could not import a single grain of foreign rice. However, thanks to the efforts of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government and the support of the people in the liberated areas, the supply of grain in Shanghai has always been sufficient, and the price of rice has been stabilized in practice. After March of this year, as a result of the implementation of the correct financial and economic policies of the Central People's Government, general prices have also begun to stabilize. This is the happiness that the people of Shanghai have not enjoyed for more than a decade. (5) In the implementation of the policy of giving consideration to both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital, although there are many shortcomings, the government is making its best efforts to engage in it. In order to help private enterprises maintain production, the government has widely carried out processing and weaving, ordering and purchasing, and lending and discounting. From the liberation of Shanghai to March of this year, Shanghai's public and private banks alone have lent 431 billion yuan to private industry and commerce. Labor-capital relations have also made progress.

　　We Must Strengthen Cadre Education and Correct Shortcomings in Our Work

　　The People's Government also has the following shortcomings in its work during this period: (1) In the process of implementing policies, there have been "leftist" tendencies that have deviated from the masses. In the execution of fiscal tasks, there was a simplistic task-oriented view. For example, when promoting public bonds, there was a lack of in-depth publicity and persuasion, and a failure to mobilize the consciousness and willingness of the broad masses, resulting in the failure to complete the actual sales task by 100% as scheduled. In tax collection work, the enthusiasm of taxpayers for fulfilling their glorious personal obligations was ignored, and there were tendencies to rely solely on heavy fines for checking accounts and to be overly meticulous in collection, resulting in dissatisfaction among some people with tax collection work, and on the other hand, causing serious tax evasion and tax evasion. In handling public-private and labor-capital relations, there have also been seemingly correct but actually erroneous statements such as "public before private" and "rather offend the capitalists than not speak for the workers," and the principles of "giving consideration to both public and private interests" and "benefiting both labor and capital" have not been fully and conscientiously implemented. This shows that we must strengthen the ideological education and learning of cadre policies in the future. (2) In a small number of cadres, there have been degenerate phenomena of corruption and decay. This has attracted our serious attention, and we must strengthen rectification studies and discipline education in the future. (3) Bureaucratic style has already begun to sprout in the administrative work system. This bad style must be resolutely eliminated.

　　Since the major fluctuation of national prices in November of last year, the Central People's Government has taken emergency measures to suppress prices. After the implementation of various measures for unified financial and economic work at the beginning of this year, prices have begun to stabilize. This is a prelude to the beginning of the improvement of the national economy. However, Shanghai's commerce, due to its long-term reliance on imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism for survival, coupled with the difficulties caused by enemy bombing and blockade, has encountered new and serious difficulties in the process of transformation from old to new. While there are indeed many people in the industrial and commercial circles who are mentally prepared to overcome temporary difficulties, there are also many who lack the courage to continue to move forward. The Third People's Representative Conference correctly analyzed the root causes and nature of the difficulties and determined specific methods to overcome the difficulties and strive for improvement. After the closing of the Third People's Representative Conference, the government immediately began to adjust public-private relations, and has taken necessary steps and methods to maintain legitimate private industrial and commercial enterprises. The democratic evaluation of industrial and commercial taxes has been practically arranged and must be fair and reasonable, and forced apportionment must be opposed. There are also specific plans and organizations for relief for the unemployed and out-of-school children. The method of private enterprise labor-capital consultation meetings has been widely implemented. Now that the Zhoushan Islands have been completely liberated, the threat of enemy blockade and bombing has been basically eliminated, and favorable conditions for overcoming difficulties and striving for improvement are being formed and developed. The people of Shanghai should strengthen unity, continue to vigorously support the front, finally liberate Taiwan, and fight for the complete elimination of the Kuomintang reactionaries and bandits and the construction of a new Shanghai.

　　上海市人民政府一年来的工作
    ——潘汉年副市长在庆祝解放一周年大会上的报告摘要
    【新华社上海二十八日电】潘汉年副市长在上海各界人民庆祝解放一周年纪念大会上所作上海市人民政府一年来施政报告的摘要。
    在毛主席和中共中央领导下，市政府工作人员严守纪律，稳步前进，在去年五月二十八日解放后两个月内，便基本上完成了接收任务。但上海的胜利解放，同时也带来了发展中的困难：敌人开始了对上海的封锁，生产停顿，投机市场尚未消灭，物价继续波动，部分缺乏远见的人因对胜利中的困难的暂时性质认识不清而产生了悲观失望情绪。在第一次各界人民代表会上，中共上海市委会饶漱石同志作了“为粉碎敌人封锁，建设新上海而斗争”的报告，明确指出必须坚决肃清对帝国主义的幻想，坚定独立自主的改造旧上海的决心，以便克服困难。会议通过了支援南下大军，改变今后上海生产方针与发展方向，发展内地交通、鼓励城乡物资交流等六大任务。
    执行六大任务  获得巨大成绩
    市政府在第一、二次各界人民代表会议后，领导与团结全市人民执行六大任务，进行反封锁、反轰炸斗争，获得了巨大的成绩：（１）上海解放后，敌人曾企图以封锁和轰炸来窒息上海的经济。但人民政府以毫不动摇的决心，用一切力量维持与恢复了必要的工商业。人民政府曾推动组织公私联营、联运，以解决原料、销路问题，并以贷款、定货、收购等办法，解决若干私营企业缺乏流动资金的困难。（２）由于去年水灾严重，从灾区逃来上海的难民为数很多，加上匪机滥炸上海，造成了更严重的情况。政府面对这一现实，尽管有财政困难，但仍以极大力量和经费进行救济工作。至去年十一月止，上海救灾机关曾拨出粮食六千万斤，用以工代赈的方式，共计修建苏北棉垦区海堤二百余里，可保护棉田二百四十多万亩，并可新垦棉田二百余万亩。去年七月至今年三月，由上海市政府遣送回乡生产或参加修建海堤的难民共达三十五万人左右。（３）今年二月六日美制匪机滥炸上海，使市民生命财产受到重大损失。上海电力公司发电设备被毁三分之二。但经过工人、工程师、技术人员和解放军团结一致在人民政府领导下积极抢修，至同月十五日止，该公司原有发电量即恢复了百分之六十五，使市民生活及一切工业得以维持。人民政府并更进一步组织全市人民进行了有效的防空工作。（４）上海市人民政府在中央人民政府及华东军政委员会领导下，保证了上海人民日常必需品的供应。上海在解放前数十年来都是依靠大宗洋米入口来解决人民的必需的。在解放前，上海米价一日数涨。而在解放后，上海又得不到一粒洋米进口。但由于上海市人民政府的努力和各解放区人民的支援，上海市的粮食供应始终充足，而且实际上做到米价稳定。今年三月后，中央人民政府正确的财经政策施行的结果，一般物价也已开始稳定。这是上海人民十几年来没有享受到的幸福。（５）在实行公私兼顾、劳资两利政策方面，虽存在不少缺点，但政府是以最大的努力去从事的。为了帮助私营企业维持生产，政府曾广泛进行代织代纺，定货收购，贷款押汇。自上海解放至今年三月止，仅上海公私营行庄对私营工商业贷款即达四千三百十亿元。劳资关系也已经有了进步。
    必须加强干部教育  纠正工作中的缺点
    人民政府在这一段时期的工作中，也有如下缺点：（１）在执行政策过程中，曾经发生过脱离群众的“左”的偏向。在执行财政任务方面，有单纯任务观点。如推销公债时，缺乏深入宣传说服，不善于发动广大群众的自觉自愿，以致未能如期百分之百地完成实销任务。在税收工作中，忽略了组织与发动纳税户为完成个人光荣义务的热忱，有单纯依靠查账重罚、稽征涉及苛细等偏向，致造成一部分人对税收工作的不满，另方面又造成了严重的漏税、逃税现象。在处理公私、劳资关系上也曾发现“先公后私”，“宁可得罪资方，不能不为工人说话”等似是而非的说法，没有完全地认真贯彻“公私兼顾”“劳资两利”的方针。这说明我们今后必须加强干部政策思想的教育与学习。（２）在少数干部中发生了贪污腐化的蜕化现象。这已引起我们严重注意，今后要加强整风学习和纪律教育。（３）在行政工作系统中，官僚主义作风已有萌芽。这种恶劣作风必须坚决肃清。
    自去年十一月全国物价大波动以后，中央人民政府采取紧急措施，抑平物价。今年初实行统一财经工作的各项措施后，物价已开始稳定。这是全国经济开始好转的前奏。但上海之商业由于过去长期依赖帝国主义及官僚资本主义而生存，加上敌人轰炸、封锁所造成的困难，在新旧蜕化的过程中，遇到了新的严重困难。工商界对克服暂时困难有思想准备的固然不少，但缺乏勇气继续前进的人也很多。第三次各界人民代表会正确地分析了困难的根源及其性质，确定了克服困难争取好转的具体办法。在第三次各界人民代表会议闭幕后，政府立即着手调整公私关系，对于维持正当私营工商企业，已采取必要步骤与办法。工商业税的民主评议已实际布置，必须做到公平合理，反对强迫摊派。救济失业失学也有了具体计划和组织。私营企业劳资协商会议的办法已普遍实行。现在舟山群岛已经全部解放，敌人的封锁轰炸的威胁已基本解除，克服困难、争取好转的有利条件正在形成与发展中。上海人民更应加强团结，继续大力支援前线，最后解放台湾，为彻底消灭国民党反动派残匪，建设新上海而斗争。
