Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: Song Qingling's closing speech at the Chinese People's Relief Representative Conference on April 29th is as follows:

Fellow Representatives:

Our National People's Relief Representative Conference is about to conclude, and this conference has been richly rewarding and successful. The reason for the success of this conference, I think, is first and foremost due to the ardent expectations of the people throughout the country. Under the dual oppression of reactionary forces and imperialism, the Chinese people were plunged into a long period of suffering. Now that China has been basically liberated, the disasters left behind by the reactionary bandits still exist. Therefore, the people of the whole country are willing to unite, overcome difficulties, heal wounds, and strive to build a new China under the leadership of the People's Government. They ardently expect the National People's Relief Representative Conference to take clear and effective action in healing wounds and relieving suffering, and the Chinese people are willing to demonstrate heroic spirit in this action, just as they did in the War of Liberation. This is an important foundation for the success of the conference. Secondly, the success of this conference is due to correct leadership, and special mention should be made of Comrade Dong Biwu, who, despite being ill, gave us a report on the relief and welfare work of the new China, and this report was so complete that we had nothing more to say. This report aptly pointed out the general direction of the Chinese people's relief and welfare undertakings, which is also the working direction of the newly established National People's Relief Association. This is a major gain of this conference. Again, the success of this conference is due to the efforts of all the representatives. The representatives come from different regions, different groups, and undertake different tasks, but they all have one thing in common, that is, they all have rich experience in relief and welfare work and are determined to serve the new China. Therefore, in these few days of the conference, everyone has been working excitedly and nervously, especially the representatives who participated in the review group and the representatives who held positions, often working until late at night. In the group discussions, the mood of the representatives was so warm, and the speeches at the conference were so wonderful. Through this conference, an unprecedented unity of national relief and welfare workers was created, which is another gain of this conference. Finally, it should also be mentioned that the success of this conference is due to the thorough preparation work. The preparation work for this conference began in October last year, and the staff of the China Liberated Areas Relief General Association mainly participated in the preparation work. They have been busy with the preparation work for half a year, and they have been working hard in the secretariat of the conference during the conference. Thanks to their diligence and efforts, the conference was able to proceed smoothly and achieve final success. We would like to especially thank all the gentlemen who participated in the preparation work and the secretariat of the conference.

Now the conference is about to come to a victorious conclusion, and the National People's Relief Association is about to be established. In addition to rejoicing and congratulating myself, I would like to offer a few hopes to all the representatives and future work:

First, I hope that all representatives will convey the spirit and resolutions of this conference to all relief and welfare workers and to all the people, so that they can understand that the relief and welfare undertakings of the new China are based on self-reliance and self-help, and that under the leadership of the People's Government, we will surely be able to overcome disasters. Second, I hope that after this conference and under the leadership of the future Relief General Association, relief and welfare workers across the country will unite more closely, criticize the old and learn the new. In the past, many people who were enthusiastic about relief and welfare undertakings have made considerable contributions to the Chinese people. In the future, in united action, they will be more closely linked with the masses of the people and strive for the relief and welfare undertakings of the new China. Third, I hope that under the call of the People's Government and the promotion of the National Relief General Association, the people of the whole country will take more active actions, organize their own strength, and resolutely overcome the current temporary disasters with the spirit of self-reliance through production, thrift, and mutual aid in labor. Chairman Mao said: "The Chinese people have always been a diligent and brave nation." Vice Premier Dong also said in his report to this conference: "Since our Chinese people can defeat the modernized enemy army in battle and liberate ourselves, we will surely be able to heal the wounds of war and build China in peace after the war." Therefore, we have full confidence that we can accomplish this task. Fourth, I hope that this conference can give a strong answer to all the conspiracies and tricks of the imperialists who engage in so-called disaster relief. In this regard, the conference has already passed two very valuable resolutions, namely, the declaration exposing the US imperialist conspiracy and the telegram responding to the call of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. I also hope that in future work, we will continue to expose all the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism and reactionaries, and establish genuine friendship between all peace-loving people in the world and our people. Through this mutual friendly assistance and encouragement, we will unite to overthrow the common enemy and achieve lasting peace and happiness for all mankind!

　　在中国人民救济代表会议上
    宋庆龄致闭幕词
    【新华社三日讯】宋庆龄在四月二十九日中国人民救济代表会议上的闭幕词，全文如下：各位代表：
    我们的全国人民救济代表会议就要结束了，这次会议有了丰富的收获，它是成功的。这次会议所以成功的原因，我想首先是由于全国人民热烈的期望。在反动势力和帝国主义双重压迫之下，中国人民陷于长期水深火热之中。现在全中国已经基本解放了，但是反动匪帮遗留下的灾难还存在着。因此全国人民愿意团结起来，在人民政府的领导下，克服困难，医治创伤，并为建设新中国而努力。他们热烈的期望全国人民救济代表会议就医治创伤，救济苦难方面采取明确而有效的行动，中国人民愿意在这种行动中，如同在解放战争中一样，表现出英雄气概。这是大会成功的重要基础。其次，这次会议之所以成功，是由于得有正确的领导，特别应该提出来的，是解总董必武主席于病中，还给我们做了关于新中国的救济福利事业的报告，而这篇报告做得是如此完整，以致使我们没有更多的话好讲了。这篇报告恰好是提示了中国人民救济福利事业的总方针，也就是刚刚产生的全国人民救济总会的工作方针。这是本次会议中重大的收获。再次，这次会议之所以成功，是由于各位代表的努力。各位代表来自不同的地区，不同的团体，担任着不同的工作，但有一点相同之处，就是都有丰富的救济福利工作的经验，并决心为新中国服务。因此在这几天会议中，大家都兴奋而紧张的工作着，尤其参加审查小组的代表及负有职务的代表们往往工作到深夜。在小组讨论中代表的情绪是那样热烈，而大会中的发言又是那样精彩，通过这次会议，产生了全国救济福利工作者的空前大团结，这是本次会议的又一收获。最后，还要提到，这次会议的所以成功是由于筹备工作的周密。这次会议筹备工作从去年十月便开始了，参加筹备工作的以中国解放区救济总会的工作人员为主，他们为筹备工作一直忙了半年，在会议进行期间他们又在大会秘书处中辛苦的工作着。由于他们的勤劳和努力，使得大会得以顺利的进行而达到最后的成功。我们要特别感谢参加筹备工作和大会秘书处工作的各位先生们。
    现在会议就要胜利的结束了，全国人民救济总会就要组成了。本人除了欢欣庆幸之外，愿对各位代表及今后的工作提出几点希望：
    第一，希望各位代表把这次会议的精神和决议传达出去，传达给一切救济福利工作者，传达给全体人民，使他们了解新中国的救济福利事业是以自救自助为基础的，而且在人民政府领导下一定能战胜灾难。第二，希望全国救济福利工作者，经过这次会议，并在将来救济总会的领导下，更加紧密的团结起来，批判旧的，学习新的。过去有不少热心救济福利事业的人士，曾对中国人民做了相当的供献，今后在团结一致的行动中，将更加与人民大众连结在一起，为新中国的救济福利事业而奋斗。第三，希望全国人民在人民政府的号召与全国救济总会的推动之下，更加积极的行动起来，组织起自己的力量，通过生产节约，劳动互助，坚决的以自力更生的精神来克服目前暂时的灾难。毛主席说：“中国人民从来就是个勤劳而勇敢的民族”。董副总理在本会的报告中也说：“我们中国人民既能在战斗中战胜近代化的敌人军队，解放了自己，我们也就必然能够在战后医好战争创伤，在和平中建设中国”。因此，我们有充分的自信能够完成这一任务。第四，希望这次会议可以给一切帝国主义者假救灾之名而进行的阴谋诡计一个有力的答复。关于这方面，大会已经通过了两项很有价值的决议，就是揭露美帝阴谋的宣言，和响应世界和平大会常设委员会的号召的通电。更希望在今后的工作中，不断的揭露一切帝国主义和反动派的阴谋诡计，并建立世界上一切爱好和平的人民和我国人民之间的真正友谊。通过这种相互间友谊的援助和鼓励，进而团结一致的打倒共同的敌人，实现全人类的永久和平与幸福！
