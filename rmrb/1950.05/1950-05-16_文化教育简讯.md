    △To facilitate students' listening to lectures, the North China People's Revolutionary University has recently begun constructing a large open-air classroom. Responding to the school's call to establish a labor perspective and save state expenditure, all school staff and workers participated in the earth-carrying work for the classroom construction.

    △Wuhan University students have begun engaging in extracurricular production this semester. Under the call of the student union, students from various classes have cultivated more than twenty-two mu of wasteland in groups, mostly planting vegetables such as string beans, pumpkins, amaranth, and tomatoes. Students from the Agricultural College also took on the task of providing planting guidance. At the same time, they also received twenty-four mu of cultivated land from the Wuhan University Farm to plant cotton and rice.
