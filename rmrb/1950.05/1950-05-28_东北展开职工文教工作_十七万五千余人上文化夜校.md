Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 18th. Worker cultural and educational work is being universally carried out in the Northeast region. According to incomplete statistics, in the Songjiang, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Lushun-Dalian, Shenyang, railway, coal mine and other fourteen regions and industrial trade union systems, there are already 3,624 cultural night schools, with more than 175,000 workers participating in learning, accounting for about 25% of the region's more than 710,000 illiterate and semi-literate workers. The Lushun-Dalian region, where the learning movement started earliest and achieved the best results, has more than 90% of its 50,700 illiterate workers participating in learning; among them, workers who can recognize 600 to 1,200 characters account for 67.4%. In Anshan City, because enterprise trade unions and administrative departments do not pay enough attention to worker education, less than seven per thousand of the total number of workers participate in learning.

In learning, various factories and mines have used and created various forms. For example, in view of the difficulties of many small factories, scattered workers, and the impossibility of many factories to run night schools, Harbin City has used the classrooms of primary and secondary schools to run large-scale regional night schools. In the coal mining area, because the mine pits are scattered and production is carried out in three shifts, classes cannot be concentrated. The Xi'an and Fuxin mines have created pithead schools. In addition to regular spare-time cultural schools, the Lushun-Dalian area has also organized literacy mutual aid groups, small teacher system for decentralized teaching, literacy signs, and cultural posts. The Shenyang Paint School created a "literacy master-apprentice contract." The railway system has set up mobile literacy groups.

Whether or not the spare-time cultural and educational work of workers can be carried out smoothly, the attention and support of the enterprise administration is one of the important conditions. The Shenyang Woolen Mill's workers' night school initially collapsed several times because the administration did not pay enough attention, using study time for meetings and spare-time labor. Later, it was stipulated in the collective contract that the administration's use of study time must be approved by the trade union's learning committee, thereby guaranteeing the workers' study time, and the number of night school students immediately increased greatly. Workers have also persevered in their studies during the intense new record movement.

### 东北展开职工文教工作  十七万五千余人上文化夜校

　　东北展开职工文教工作
    十七万五千余人上文化夜校
    【新华社沈阳十八日电】东北地区的职工文化教育工作普遍开展。据不完全统计：松江、黑龙江、吉林、旅大、沈阳、铁路、煤矿等十四个地区和产业工会系统中，已有文化夜校三千六百二十四所，参加学习的工人有十七万五千余人，约占全区七十一万以上文盲与半文盲工人的百分之二十五。学习运动开展最早、成绩最好的旅大地区，在五万零七百余名文盲工人中，已有百分之九十以上参加了学习；其中识六百字至一千二百字的工人占百分之六十七点四。鞍山市则因企业工会、行政方面对职工教育工作注意不够，工人参加学习的就不到总数千分之七。
    在学习中，各厂矿运用和创造了各种形式。如哈尔滨市鉴于小型工厂多、工人分散和许多工厂不可能办夜校的困难，即利用中、小学的教室，开办了较大规模的地区夜校。在煤矿区，因为矿坑分散，生产又是三班制，不能集中上课，西安、阜新两矿便创造了坑口学校。旅大地区除业余正规的文化学校外，更组织了识字互助小组、分散教学的小先生制、识字牌、文化岗等。沈阳油漆学校创造了“识字师徒合同”。铁路系统则创办了流动识字小组。
    职工业余文教工作的能否顺利开展，企业行政的重视和支持是重要条件之一。沈阳毛织厂工人夜校，初因行政上重视不够，占用学习时间开会和进行业余劳动，使夜校数次垮台；后在集体合同中规定：行政上占用学习时间得经工会学委会同意，因而保证了职工学习时间，夜校学生立刻大增。工人学习在紧张的新纪录运动中也坚持了下来。
