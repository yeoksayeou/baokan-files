　　Preventing Aphids, Fighting Drought, and Resisting Wind: Ensuring Increased Cotton Production
    The Jinan Cotton Region Intensifies Seedling Hoeing
    [Our newspaper, Baoding] In the southern Hebei prefectures of Handan, Xingtai, Hengshui, Shijiazhuang, Dingxian, and others, cotton seedlings have emerged mostly well. In some cotton fields, the seedlings are incomplete, and local governments have been leading farmers to replant. In order to prevent cotton aphids, fight drought, resist wind, and achieve increased cotton production, a wave of cotton seedling hoeing is now underway in various places. Wu'an County has planted a total of 405,600 mu of cotton, of which 263,640 mu have been hoeed. Cotton fields in the 3rd and 6th districts of Linze have also been mostly hoeed. Seedling hoeing work in Xingtai, Neiqiu, Daming, Nangong, Shulu, Shenxian, Dingxian, and other counties is also in progress, and many villages have already completed the first hoeing.

    Leadership at all levels in the province is paying close attention to seedling protection work. After the cotton sowing task was completed, they conducted cotton planting summaries and proposed launching a seedling protection campaign. This promptly corrected the slack thinking and complacency of some cadres who believed that once cotton was sown, everything would be fine. As soon as the cotton planting work in Wu'an was completed, the county government arranged for the leaders of each district to guide the masses in hoeing seedlings, preventing insects, and protecting seedlings. The Wu'an County Committee of the Communist Party of China also convened a meeting of district party secretaries to mobilize party members throughout the county to lead the masses in hoeing seedlings. Party members and cadres in various villages put forward slogans to the masses such as "Hoeing an inch early is better than applying fertilizer" and "Hoeing seedlings can control insects, prevent drought, and resist wind," to mobilize the masses to go to the fields to hoe seedlings. Ma Fuchang, a trainee in Boyan Village of the Communist Party, hoeed his cotton seedlings twice, leading six households to hoe 80 mu. After cadres in Beiliangtai Village, Xingtai, publicized the benefits of early seedling hoeing to the masses, the entire village hoeed 100 mu of seedlings in one day. Some village cadres in Dingxian used grass with aphids pulled from the fields to educate the masses and mobilize them to hoe seedlings. In order to do a good job in seedling protection and hoeing, Shijiazhuang and Hengshui prefectures convened meetings of county agricultural cadres and agricultural technicians in early May to study methods of seedling hoeing and insect prevention. The Linqing Farm and the Linqing Cotton Production Guidance Area have sent 15 cadres to Linqing and other eight counties to hold seedling protection training classes, teaching farmers how to hoe seedlings, prevent insects, and other methods. Technical cadres from the North China Farm have also gone to the countryside to mobilize farmers in Jin County and other places to hoe seedlings and eliminate aphids. (Li Kai)

    [Our newspaper, Cangxian] A widespread seedling hoeing campaign has been launched in Cangxian Prefecture, Hebei, and watering cotton fields to control aphids is also being carried out simultaneously. After completing the work of inspecting and replenishing seedlings in the prefecture, they are now carrying out thinning, setting seedlings, and hoeing. As of May 20th, according to incomplete statistics from 65 villages in Xianxian, Hejian, Cangxian, Suning, Qingxian, and other five counties, 17,724 mu have been hoeed, accounting for more than 65% of the original 28,017 mu of various crops sown. Among them, 619 mu of cotton have been thinned and seedlings set, and the second hoeing has begun. Recently, due to frequent winds and the land being prone to dryness, all localities have paid attention to protecting seedlings (especially cotton seedlings), and most areas have launched water carrying and watering (watering at the seedling roots). For example, 37 households in Hanzheng Village, Cangxian, watered 36 mu; 60 party members and cadres in Dulin Village divided up the low-lying areas to lead the masses in watering seedlings, and 39 households in Daduokou Village watered 24% of the village's cotton fields. However, aphids have been found on cotton seedlings in some areas. The Hebei Provincial People's Government has issued 300 sprayers to Cangxian Prefecture, and the counties began using them before May 20th. The Cotton Production Guidance Area has also sent technical cadres with sprayers and medicines to various places to promote control and treatment. In general, the masses are being widely mobilized and led to carry out control and treatment using tobacco leaf water and other methods.

　　防蚜抗旱抗风·保证棉花增产
    冀南棉区抓紧锄苗
    【本报保定讯】河北南部邯郸、邢台、衡水、石家庄、定县等专区棉田出苗大部良好，部分棉田棉苗不全，各地人民政府已领导农民进行了补种。为了防除棉蚜，抗旱，抗风，实现棉田增产，各地现已掀起锄棉苗热潮。武安县共植棉四十万五千六百亩，已锄完二十六万三千六百四十亩。临泽三、六区棉田亦大部锄完。邢台、内邱、大名、南宫、束鹿、深县、定县等县锄苗工作，亦正在进行，不少村已经锄完头遍。
    该省各地领导方面，对保苗工作抓得较紧，棉花播种任务完成后，即通过种棉总结，提出开展保苗运动。及时纠正了部分干部认为种上了棉花就百事大吉的松懈思想和自满情绪。武安种棉工作刚一结束，该县人民政府就布置领导各区群众锄苗、防虫、保苗；中共武安县委也召开区委书记会议，动员全县党员带动群众锄苗。各村党员、干部并向群众提出“早锄一寸，好比上粪”，“锄苗能治虫，防旱又抗风”等口号，动员群众下地锄苗。伯延村中共学员马福昌把自己棉苗锄了二遍，带动六户锄苗八十亩。邢台北良台村干部，将早锄苗的好处向群众宣传后，全村一天内就锄苗一百亩。定县有些村干部，用地里拔来有蚜虫的草，教育群众，动员群众锄苗。为了把保苗锄苗工作做好，石家庄、衡水两个专区在五月初召开了县农业干部，农业技术人员会议，研究锄苗、防虫等方法。临清农场、临清棉产指导区，并已派出十五个干部，到临清等八县举办保苗训练班，教会农民锄苗、防虫等办法。华北农场技术干部也下乡分别到晋县等地发动农民锄苗、灭蚜。

    【本报沧县讯】河北沧县专区普遍发起锄苗运动，浇棉田治蚜虫也同时展开。该专区完成查苗补苗工作后，正在进行间苗、定苗、锄苗工作截至五月二十日为止，据献县、河间、沧县、肃宁、青县等五县六十五个村不完全统计，已锄过一万七千七百二十四亩，占原播种二万八千零一十七亩各种作物百分之六十五强。其中有棉花六百一十九亩经过间苗、定苗后，开始锄二遍。近来因风多，地易干燥，各地都注意了保苗（特别对棉苗），大部地区展开了挑水浇地（在苗根浇水），如沧县韩正庄三十七户就浇了三十六亩；杜林村六十个党员，干部分洼分片带动群众浇苗，大渡口村三十九户浇过水的，占全村棉田百分之二十四。但有部分地区棉苗发现蚜虫，河北省人民政府已发给沧县专区喷雾器三百具，各县于五月二十日前已开始使用。棉产指导区亦派技术干部带喷雾器、药品等到各地推广除治。一般地区正广泛的发动与领导群众用烟叶水等方法开展除治中。（沧县专署王万国、崔金祥）
