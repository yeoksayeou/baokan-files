	After reading the "Beethoven Biography" published by Sanlian Bookstore, I feel that the preface written by the translator, Mr. Fu Lei, and the appendix, "Beethoven's Works and Their Spirit," reveal many bourgeois philosophical viewpoints and even some religious theistic viewpoints in their comments on Beethoven's genius and achievements and historical and cultural issues. This is harmful to readers.

	Beethoven is indeed a great musician in history. His life was one of struggle, leaving many inspirations for future generations. His genius and achievements' contributions to European classical music cannot be denied. However, the translator's evaluation that "such permanence, such superhumanity, probably no musician can compare with Beethoven" is somewhat excessive. As long as the world and history are not static, there will be no eternal extreme, especially the development and achievements of socialist era people's music will be limitless.

	In the preface and appendix, the translator excessively exaggerates the role of the individual in history, misinterprets the laws of historical development, and advocates that individual effort can reverse the universe. This is extreme individual hero and individualism. In the appendix, the translator says: "Beethoven and power, this is a topic born together." "Power is enough to promote life, and can also promote death." "A person with power is like holding a pendulum that reverses the universe." "Power liberates the individual, and the individual liberates the masses." He also says: "The nineteenth century... belonged to the strong... Whoever dares to solemnly advocate and command, society will follow him. The strength of the individual has the potential to devour everything." "An old society has collapsed, and a new society is brewing. In the process of transition, the first thing is to liberate the individual. ...Individualism that strives for all freedom is the forerunner of the future world. Each has its own era. First is: Me! Then is: Society." The translator here exaggerates the power of the individual's "power" to such an extent! Who doesn't know that Napoleon and Metternich were powerful rulers, but European society did not follow their command and rule as Napoleon and Metternich had hoped. The people and society still followed their own path of progress. Isn't this the truth of history? Of course, we know that during the European bourgeois revolution, individual freedom and liberation were used as slogans, and the development of individualism corresponded to the development of capitalism. However, Marxists and progressive human beings believe that the masses are the masters of history, the masses create history and culture, and class struggle is the driving force of social development in all class societies. The bourgeois democratic revolution that took place in Europe in the first half of the nineteenth century was a social change. In this change, the bourgeoisie seized power, and the proletariat gained a "freedom" to sell its labor and be exploited. The bourgeoisie's so-called "individual liberation" and "me" are nothing more than this. And today in the twentieth century, what is the point of the translator interpreting European history in such an uncritical way and advocating for the liberation of the individual first!

	The translator says "the wild power given to him (referring to Beethoven) by nature," power can conquer suffering, encourage humanity, power can liberate everything, then what exactly is "power"? Since the translator does not recognize that the masses are the creators of history and culture, of course, he will not seek the source of "power" in the countless real "people" in reality. As a result, he can only fall into the idealistic religious "god" quagmire and become a preacher of transcendental religious spirit, spreading a smokescreen to cover up the truth of the sins of the old society. In his appendix, he says: "As a result of liberation and expansion, man and God approach each other, and become one with God. At that time, power is God, power is power, there is no good or evil, there is no conflict. The two extremes of power are eliminated. Man has transcended the world, jumped out of all tribulations, life has come to an end, and is already immortal. This is joy, this is Beethovenian joy!" "Individuals" and "power" can liberate everything, where does its power lie? It also lies in the "union of man and God." The liberation advocated by the translator is originally the same as the Buddhist "Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss" and the Western Christian "Heaven" ideal, and the end of liberation is originally the end of life, the transcendence of the world by man. Isn't this kind of talk harmful religious talk? Who doesn't know that religious teachings, the "power" of "God," are only tools to cover up the sins of the old society, numb the people, make the people forget "suffering," not fight, and consolidate the rule of the reactionary rulers, and will never eliminate "one end is peace, happiness, progress, civilization, and beauty; the other end is massacre, chaos, war, barbarism, and ugliness," the liberator of liberating mankind?

	The translator's preface and appendix to this book were both written in 1942. We don't know whether the translator still retains these views today, and it is very likely that they have changed. However, the time when Sanlian Bookstore printed this book was November 1949. Those responsible for reviewing this manuscript should have reconsidered this type of previous writing. The people's publishing cause is responsible to the people, so every book should require correct content and healthy and disease-free thinking. The reason why I want to say "this type of previous writing" is because I have seen that Sanlian Bookstore has recently reprinted many books on social sciences and other aspects that were published in the Kuomintang-controlled areas before. It has not paid due attention to some places that must be revised for those that do not meet the requirements of the times or even have adverse effects, which is not right. I hope that Sanlian Bookstore and other bookstores will re-examine the content of the reprinted books.

### 对三联书店版《贝多芬传》译序和附录的几点意见

　　对三联书店版《贝多芬传》译序和附录的几点意见编辑同志：
    梅关桦
    我读了三联书店出版的《贝多芬传》，觉得译者傅雷先生所作的序和书后附录《贝多芬作品及其精神》二文，在评论贝多芬的天才成就和历史文化诸问题上，流露着许多资产阶级哲学的观点，甚至于还有一些宗教式的有神论观点。这对读者是有害的。
    贝多芬诚然是一个历史上的大音乐家，他的一生是奋斗的一生，留给后人很多启示，他的天才和成就对于欧洲古典音乐的贡献是不能抹煞的。但是译者“如是恒久，如是超人式的，恐怕没有一个音乐家可与贝多芬相比”这样的评价，却未免过分。世界和历史，只要不是静止的，永恒的极点是不会有的，尤其是社会主义时代人民音乐的发展和成就，将是无可限量的。
    译者在序和附录中一味夸大个人在历史中所起的作用，错误地解释历史发展的规律，主张个人努力就可以扭转乾坤，这是极端的个人英雄和个人主义思想。译者在附录中说：“贝多芬与力，这是一个天生就的题目。”“力足以推动生命，也能促进死亡。”“具有力的人，宛如执握着一个转捩乾坤的钟摆。”“力解放了个人，个人解放了大众。”他又说：“十九世纪……是属于强者的……谁敢威严地主张和命令，社会就跟着他走。个人的强项，直有吞噬一切之势。”“一个古老的社会崩溃了，一个新的社会在酝酿中。在青黄不接的过程内，第一先得解放个人。………争取一切自由的个人主义，是未来世界的先驱。各有各的时代。第一是：我！然后是：社会。”译者在这里竟把个人的“力”的权力，夸大到这样的地步！谁不知道，拿破伦和梅特涅是够威严的强力的统治者了，但是欧洲的社会，并没有如拿破伦和梅特涅所妄想的那样，听从他们的力的指挥与统治，人民和社会还是按照自己的进步的道路走的。难道历史的真相，不就是这样吗？我们当然知道：欧洲资产阶级革命的时候，曾经以个人的自由解放为号召，个人主义的发展正是与资本主义的发展相应的。但是马克思主义者和进步的人类，都认为历史的主人是群众，群众创造了历史和文化，阶级斗争才是在一切有阶级的社会内社会发展的动力。十九世纪前半期的在欧洲进行着的资产阶级民主革命，是一个社会变革，在这个变革中，资产阶级取得了政权，无产阶级取得了一个出卖劳动力的被剥削的“自由”，资产阶级的所谓“个人解放”与“我”，不过如此而已。而在二十世纪的今日，译者竟这样毫无批判的解释欧洲的历史，再来鼓吹一番首先解放个人，这有什么意义呢！
    译者说“天赋给他（指贝多芬）的犷野的力”，力能征服苦难，鼓励人类，力能解放一切，那么“力”到底是什么呢？译者既未承认群众是历史和文化的创造者，当然，“力”的泉源，他就不会在现实的无数的真实的“人”中去找寻，结果，他只好陷入于唯心的宗教式的“神”的泥坑里，并且成了超然出世主义的宗教精神的布道者，散布掩饰旧社会罪恶真相的烟幕了。他的附录中说：“解放与扩大的结果，人与神明迫近，与神明合一。那时候，力就是神，力就是力，无所谓善恶，无所谓冲突。力的两极消灭了。人已超临了世界，跳出了万劫，生命已告终结，同时已经不朽。这才是欢乐，这才是贝多芬式的欢乐！”“个人”和“力”能解放一切，其力量何在呢？还在于“人和神明合一”。译者所主张的解放原来和佛教的“极乐世界”，西洋教的“天堂”理想一样，而解放的终结，原来是生命的已告终结，人的超临世界。这一派话，不是有害的宗教之说是什么呢？谁不知道宗教的说教，“神明”的“力”，只是为了要掩饰旧社会的罪恶，麻醉人民，叫人民忘掉“苦难”，不要斗争，为反动统治者巩固统治的工具，而绝不会是消灭了“一端是和平、幸福、进步、文明、美；一端是残杀、混乱、战争、野蛮、丑恶”，解放人类的解放者呢？
    这本书的译者序和附录都是在一九四二年写的。里面的这些观点，译者今天是不是还保留着，我们不知道，很可能是已经改变了。不过三联书店印行这本书的时间，是一九四九年十一月，负责审阅这本书稿的人，对于这一类以前的写作，就应该重加考虑。人民的出版事业是要对人民负责的，所以在每一本书中都应该要求内容正确，思想健康无病。我之所以要说“这一类以前的写作”的原故，因为我看到最近三联书店重印了许多以前在国民党统治区出版的社会科学等等方面的书籍，对于不合时代要求的，甚至会起不良作用的某些必须修改地方，都没有作应有的注意，这是不应该的。我希望三联书店和别的书店都来重新检查一下重版书的内容。
