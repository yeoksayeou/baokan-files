　　西北公营厂矿物资清查初步完成
    【新华社西安二十五日电】西北军政委员会工业部及陕西省工业厅所属厂矿的物资清查工作已初步告一段落。最近两个月来已进行了清理物资工作的有西北纺织建设公司及所属的三个厂，铜川煤矿、西北建设公司第一面粉厂、西北机器厂、西北电力建设公司、西京发电厂、陕西省企业公司等十六个单位。据不完全的统计，清查出的物资有各种车辆、机器、材料等五千四百五十二种，另有房屋七千九百余间、土地四百七十余亩。在此次清理工作中，不少单位的负责人和职工都积极参加，如西京发电厂职工曾于例假日自动义务加工半天，清理库存的报废器材。该厂厂长、总工程师也亲自参加。结果在一百零三种废料中发现完全不能使用的仅有十六种，其余绝大部分都是可以利用的物资。
