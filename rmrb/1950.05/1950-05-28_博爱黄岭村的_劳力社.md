    The "Labor Cooperative" of Huangling Village, Bo'ai
    Du Xuwen, Jin Chengbin, Guo Changmao
    Huangling Village is a small, barren village in the mountainous area north of Bo'ai County, fifteen *li* from the town. The village currently has 150 households (before the war, there were 201 households; due to the brutal oppression of the Japanese puppets and the Kuomintang, coupled with the famines of 1942 and 1943, 38 households died out and 29 households fled. Since liberation, 16 households have gradually returned), with a population of 506. The land area is 758.2 *mu*, averaging only about 1.5 *mu* per person. In addition, there are two coal kilns and two sulfur kilns. More than two-thirds of the people's livelihood depends on the income from coal and sulfur production. The Communist Party's work foundation is relatively good, with 53 party members (41 male, 12 female). Since the winter of 1946, the CCP branch has led the villagers in organizing a "Labor Cooperative" to mine coal and refine sulfur on a large scale. Over the past three years, it has overcome various difficulties and achieved great results. The people's lives have been lifted out of the poverty of the past and have begun to live better lives. Now, the village has increased by 271 sheep and 82 livestock (originally only 16) compared to three years ago, including 32 mules; built 32 new houses, acquired and repaired 409 pieces of farm equipment, and built 5 stone caves. In the past, the people only ate cornmeal porridge, but now they can eat a meal of noodles every day.

    The Organization and Development of the "Labor Cooperative"

    In the winter of 1946, the Chiang bandits occupied the county seat and frequently roamed the countryside. On the one hand, the people of Huangling Village actively participated in wartime services to support the army in eliminating the enemy; on the other hand, they strengthened sentry duty to protect the production of coal and sulfur kilns. However, the production and living problems of the families of those participating in the war became a major difficulty that needed to be solved urgently at that time. In order to resolve the contradiction between production and war participation, the leading organs called for carrying out a mutual aid movement. After research by the Party branch, it was decided to establish a labor cooperative.

    At the beginning of its establishment, all 110 male laborers in the village were organized as follows: 10 militiamen were specifically responsible for sentry duty; 20 people were specifically responsible for participating in war services; 70 people went down into the kilns and burned the kilns; and 10 people drove livestock for transportation. Each full laborer was assigned 10 points, and in order to take care of the war participants, they were assigned 12 points. The production income of the 80 people responsible for going down into the kilns, burning the kilns, and transportation was divided equally according to the labor points of the 110 people. This played a significant role in ensuring production and supporting the front-line tasks at that time.

    This lasted for about half a year. By the wheat harvest season of 1947, because participation in war service was not a frequent occurrence, those responsible for war service were calculated as 12 labor points every day, regardless of whether they were on duty or not, and received a share of the production profits of 80 people. The masses engaged in production felt that they were being taken advantage of and withdrew one after another. The labor cooperative thus disintegrated, and the coal and sulfur kilns were completely shut down as a result.

    At that time, the masses advocated dividing all the sundries purchased by the labor cooperative and did not plan to continue. The branch explained the benefits of the coal and sulfur kilns to the masses and explained that it should be restored in the future, so all the furniture was retained.

    In the winter of 1947, the higher authorities called for production and frugality to prepare for the famine, saving two *liang* of rice per person per day. The branch discussed this work, conducted detailed research, and made specific calculations: if the two kilns were restored, 20 *shi* of rice could be earned every day, and the entire village, young and old, could earn an average of more than 5 *jin* of rice per person per day. With such concrete figures, the production enthusiasm of the masses was inspired. Thus, the labor cooperative, which had been suspended for half a year, was revived.

    After the re-establishment of the labor cooperative, the first step was to review the reasons for the previous failure, which was mainly due to unfair point allocation and failure to meet the principles of equal exchange for labor mutual aid. Therefore, after democratic discussion, a new system and profit-sharing method were re-established. All those participating in the labor cooperative were divided into four levels according to their labor strength: 5 points, 6 points, 8 points, and 10 points; war service was provided on a rotational basis, and was uniformly calculated at 10 points. When cadres attended meetings, eating public grain was set at 5 points, and eating their own food was set at 8 points. The coal and sulfur produced belonged to the labor cooperative, which was uniformly sold, and profits were distributed according to labor points. Management personnel were democratically elected, including one manager and two accountants; each kiln had one kiln head and two group leaders, all of whom were democratically elected by the kiln workers (members). It was stipulated that group leaders and kiln heads would meet every five days, and problems would be studied and resolved immediately when discovered. Accounts were published once a month, and all finances were made public. The establishment and adherence to the above systems and profit-sharing methods is the central key to the labor cooperative's ability to persist for three years and continue to develop and expand.

    The new system was indeed much fairer than the previous one. However, in the early stage of resumption of work, the masses' production enthusiasm was still not high enough. A sulfur kiln could only produce about 100 *jin* of sulfur per day (at that time, one *jin* of sulfur could be exchanged for 10 *jin* of rice). The branch conducted further investigation and research and discovered that the crux of the problem was the lack of an incentive system. Regardless of the amount of effort or production, each person received their due share according to the prescribed points, and no one put in great effort to work. Therefore, they consulted with everyone and stipulated an award method. It was decided that when the task was exceeded, 30 percent of the increased output would be extracted as a reward. After this method was implemented, sulfur production greatly increased, from 100 *jin* per day to 160 *jin*.

    Sulfur kiln workers received bonuses due to increased production, while coal kiln workers found it difficult to receive bonuses due to excessively high demands, poor sales of coal, and low coal prices. They demanded to work in the sulfur kilns, otherwise they would not work. After everyone discussed it, all the bonuses obtained above the plan were uniformly distributed. In this way, it was actually equivalent to canceling the reward system again.

    The method of equally dividing bonuses was implemented for three or four months, but everyone felt that it did not solve the problem. It was decided to simply cancel it and re-stipulate a new method: awards would be assessed every four months, and models would be elected when the term expired. In addition to spiritual praise, material rewards would also be given. The criteria for models were: working hard, not being afraid of hardship, obeying leadership, promoting and leading others to produce, etc. In this way, a surge of striving to be a model was set off among the masses. Many people, in order to strive to be a model, squatted in cold water to mine, and production enthusiasm greatly improved. Under the direct leadership of the branch, Party members promoted the masses in production with their own exemplary actions. In the year-end awards last year, a total of 63 models were selected, including 24 Party members, who were given prizes respectively. This reward method is still implemented to this day. At the same time, giving appropriate criticism to those who do not work well also greatly promotes production. After appropriate criticism, not only was the person who was not actively engaged in production transformed, but the masses were also educated, making everyone realize that not producing well is a disgrace. Self-criticism, commendation, and criticism have become a part of the lives of all workers, and the labor cooperative itself is gradually advancing and consolidating in this constant process of self-criticism, commendation, and criticism.

    The continuous improvement and development of the labor cooperative has now exceeded the scope of simple labor and has actually become a production and marketing cooperative. The produced coal and sulfur are uniformly sold by the labor cooperative, and the cooperative has also signed a contract with the county cooperative, overcoming sales difficulties and avoiding some improper intermediate exploitation by private merchants. At the same time, in order to supply the needs of the masses, reduce the trouble and consumption of the masses personally going to the market, it purchased a large number of daily necessities such as oil, salt, and cloth after the coal and sulfur were sold, and uniformly distributed them to the masses. Last spring, 500 bolts of cloth were bought, and all the villagers put on new single-layer clothes. During the New Year, a large number of meat, vermicelli, vegetables, etc. were bought back, which facilitated the needs of the masses for the New Year. It is currently planned to buy a batch of cloth to solve this year's single-layer clothing problem. More importantly, with the assistance of the labor cooperative, the difficulties of many people in repairing houses, building houses, buying livestock, and repairing farm tools have been solved. For example, if someone wants to buy livestock, the labor cooperative will first advance the money, and then the livestock buyer will repay the debt with labor. The labor cooperative's blacksmith uniformly repairs farm tools for the masses, which is both money-saving and convenient. If the masses want to build houses and repair thatched houses but lack bricks and tiles, the labor cooperative hires technicians to burn bricks and tiles in the village.

    The labor cooperative has solved the vital problems of the masses and given them concrete benefits, so it has been enthusiastically supported by the masses, and its prestige among the masses has been unprecedentedly improved.

    The labor cooperative gives special care to the living difficulties of the families of revolutionary soldiers and cadres. When sulfur production is high, the income from breaking sulfur ore is enough to maintain their lives. When sulfur production decreases, families of revolutionary soldiers and cadres are given priority in the work of breaking sulfur ore. Widows, orphans, and children take turns breaking sulfur ore, once every other day. They are also organized to pick up sulfur ore in the used sulfur slag heaps, earning roughly three *jin* of grain per day.

    The "Labor Cooperative" of Huangling Village has been gradually improved and strengthened through exploration, and has overcome many twists and turns and difficulties. It has developed into a mass mutual aid organization that is inseparable from the lives of all villagers. In the past three years, one new coal and sulfur kiln has been opened respectively, and the number of sulfur refining furnaces has increased from more than a dozen to 25, doubling the original number. The number of workers (members) has gradually increased from more than 100 to the current 182. Every household has someone participating, and even some widowed old ladies and children participate in the labor of breaking sulfur ore. The village's two blacksmiths joined to repair tools for the cooperative and repair farm tools for the masses. At the same time, its influence has exceeded the boundaries of the village. More than 20 people from other villages have also come to participate in the production of going down into the kilns to mine, and their wages are the same as those of the villagers, with points divided and profits shared according to labor strength.

    Coal mine production has greatly increased compared to before. Now, the average daily output is more than 500 *jin* of sulfur, with each *jin* equivalent to 3 *jin* of rice, for a total of 1,500 *jin*; coal production is 13,000 *jin*, equivalent to 1,600 *jin* of rice. A total of about 3,100 *jin* of rice can be earned. After deducting expenses, the average net income per person per day is more than 3 *jin* of rice. With the development of the labor cooperative, the lives of the entire village have been improved unprecedentedly.

    "With the Communist Party, all difficulties can be solved!"

    The development, growth, and many achievements of the labor cooperative are inseparable from the leadership of the Communist Party and the exemplary role of Party members in production. The influence of the labor cooperative among the masses is increasing, the prestige of the Party among the masses is also increasing, and the relationship between the Party and the masses is also becoming closer. From the labor cooperative's leadership and management personnel democratically elected by the masses, it is clear that the masses support the Party. The manager and two accountants of the labor cooperative are all Party members; three of the four kiln heads are Party members; Party members account for six of the eight group leaders; of the models selected at the end of last year, there were 24 Party members, nearly half of all Party members. The branch secretary previously had some shortcomings in his work style, such as commandism and a harsh attitude, but because he was courageous in self-criticism, accepted the opinions of the masses, and corrected his mistakes, he also won the support of the masses. The fact that he was able to be elected as the manager of the labor cooperative by the masses is good proof. The masses reflected: "The Communist Party led the establishment of the labor cooperative, and all difficulties can be solved."

　　博爱黄岭村的“劳力社”
    杜绪文·靳承斌·郭长茂
    黄岭村，是博爱城北山地一个贫瘠的小村，距城十五里。全村现有一百五十户人家（战前二百零一户，在日伪、国民党残酷压榨下，加上一九四二、四三年的灾荒，先后死绝了三十八户，外逃二十九户，解放后至今陆续回来十六户），五百零六口人。土地七百五十八亩二分，平均每人仅有一亩半左右。此外，有煤窑、磺窑各两个。群众生活资料的来源，三分之二以上仰仗着煤、磺业生产的所得。共产党的工作基础比较好，有党员五十三人（男四十一，女十二）。自一九四六年冬开始，中共支部即领导全村群众，组织起“劳力社”，大量开煤炼磺，三年来，克服了各种困难，有了很大的成绩。群众生活已摆脱了过去多年来的贫困处境，开始过好的生活。现在，全村比三年前增加了二百七十一只羊，八十二头牲口（原只十六头），其中骡子三十二头；盖新房三十二间，新置与修理农具四百零九件，筑石洞五条。过去群众光吃玉茭面糊糊，现在每天都可吃到一顿面条。
    “劳力社”的组织与发展
    一九四六年冬季，蒋匪盘据着县城，不时到四乡窜扰。黄岭村群众一方面积极参加战争勤务，支援军队消灭敌人；一方面加强站岗放哨，以保卫煤窑磺和窑的生产。但是参战群众家庭的生产、生活问题，成了当时亟待解决的一大困难。为了解决生产与参战的矛盾，领导机关曾号召开展互助运动，经过党的支部研究后，决定成立劳力社。
    开始成立时，将全村一百一十个男劳动力都这样组织起来：十个民兵，专门站岗放哨；二十个人专门负责参加战争勤务；七十个人下窑、烧窑；十个人赶牲口搞运输。每个全劳动力定为十分，为了照顾参战群众，给他们订成十二分。负责下窑、烧窑和运输的八十个人的生产所得，按一百一十个人的劳力分数均分。这对当时的生产与支援前线任务，起了很大的保证作用。
    这样维持了半年光景，至一九四七年麦收时节，因为参加战争勤务不是经常的事情，负责战勤的人，不论出差与否，每天都按十二分劳力计算，分得八十人的生产利润，搞生产的群众感到吃亏，纷纷退出，劳力社就这样散伙了，煤窑、磺窑也就因此而全部停业。
    当时群众主张把劳力社所购置的什物全部分了，不打算再干。支部就用煤、磺窑的利益向群众解释，并说明将来还应该恢复，于是就将所有家具全部保留下来了。
    一九四七年冬天，上级号召生产节约，准备渡荒，每人每天节省二两米。支部讨论了这一工作，进行了详细研究与具体计算：如果把两个窑再恢复起来，每天可赚米二十石，全村男女老少每人每天平均可收入五斤多米。用这样具体的数字，启发了群众的生产热情。于是，停顿半年的劳力社，才又复活起来。
    劳力社再度成立后，首先检讨了前次失败的原因，主要是由于订分不公，不合乎劳动互助等价交换的原则。于是，经过民主讨论，重新订立了新的制度与分红办法。将所有参加劳力社的人，按其劳动力强度分成五分、六分、八分、十分四等；战争勤务支差轮流服务，一律按十分计算。干部开会时，吃公家的粮食订为五分，吃自己时则为八分。生产出来的煤和磺，归劳力社所有，统一推销，按劳力分数分红。民主选举了管理人员，选出经理一人，会计二人；每窑窑头一人，组长二人，也都由各窑工人（社员）民主选举产生。规定五天一次组长、窑头会议，发现问题，即时进行研究解决。一月公布一次账目，一切经济公开。以上的制度与分红办法的订立与坚持，是劳力社能够坚持三年，而且至今仍在向前发展、扩大的中心关键。
    新的制度，的确比前次是公平的多了。但复工初期，群众生产劲头仍不够高，一个磺窑一天只能产磺一百斤左右（当时一斤磺可折米十斤）。支部又进行了调查研究，发现了问题的症结在于没有奖励制度，不论出力大小，生产多少，每人都是按规定分数得到应得的一份，没有人出大力气干。于是就和大家商量，规定奖励办法。决定超过任务时，抽出增加产量的百分之三十作为奖励。这个办法实行后，硫磺产量大为提高，由每天一百斤骤增至一百六十斤。
    磺窑工人因增产而得到了奖金，煤窑工人则因要求过高、煤的销路不畅和煤价低廉而很难得到奖励，纷纷要求到磺窑作工，否则就不干了。经大家讨论后，将所有超过计划而得到的奖金，全部统一分配。这样一来，实际上等于把奖励制度又取消了。
    平分奖金的办法实行了三、四个月，大家又觉得不解决问题，乃决定干脆取消，重新规定新办法：四月一评奖，到期选举模范，除精神上的表扬外，并给以物质奖励。模范标准是：努力劳动，不怕吃苦，服从领导，推动带领别人生产等。这样，在群众中掀起了争取模范的热潮，不少的人，为了争取做模范，曾蹲到冷水里开矿，生产劲头有很大提高。党员在支部直接领导下，在生产中更以自己的模范行动，推动了群众。在去年年底评奖中，共选出模范六十三人，其中党员二十四人，都分别发给了奖品。这一奖励办法，直到现在还实行着。同时，给劳动不好的分子以适当的批评，也同样对生产有很大的推动作用。经过适当的批评，不仅改造了生产不积极者本人，同时也教育了群众，使大家觉悟到不好好生产是一种耻辱。检讨、表扬、批评，已成了全体工人的一个生活内容，而劳力社本身，也正是在这样不断检讨、不断表扬和批评中逐步前进着与巩固起来的。
    劳力社的不断改进与发展，现在已超出了单纯劳动的范围，实际上已成了生产供销社。生产出来的煤和磺，统由劳力社推销，社里又与县联社订立了合同，克服了销路困难，也避免了一些私商不正当的中间剥削。同时，为了供应群众需要，减少群众亲自赶集上店的麻烦和消费，便在煤和磺售出后，买回大批的日用必需品，如油、盐、布之类，统一配售给群众。去年春天，买回了五百匹布，全村群众换上了新单衣。过年时又买回大批的肉、粉条、菜等，便利了群众过年的需用。目前正计划买一批布来，解决今年的单衣问题。更重要的是在劳力社扶助下，解决了不少群众的修房、盖屋、买牲口、修农具等的困难。如有人要买牲口，劳力社先代拿出钱来，然后由买牲口户用工还账。劳力社的铁匠，统一给群众修理农具，既省钱、又便利。群众想盖房子、修茅房，但缺少砖瓦，劳力社就请了技师，来本村烧砖烧瓦。
    劳力社解决了群众的切身问题，给了群众以具体利益，因而得到了群众的热烈拥护，在群众中的威信也空前提高。
    对于烈军干属的生活困难，劳力社均给予特别照顾。硫磺产量多的时候，敲磺子（将大块矿石敲碎）的所得，足以维持他（她）们的生活。而在硫磺出产减少时，敲磺子的工作，烈军干属给以优先权；孤寡、小孩等则轮流敲子，隔一天一次。并组织他（她）们在用过的磺碴堆里拣拾磺子，每天也差不多赚到三斤粮食。
    黄岭村的“劳力社”，是从摸索中逐步地健全与壮大起来，经过了不少曲折，克服了重重困难，已经发展成为与全村群众生活不可分离的群众性互助组织。三年来，新开了煤、磺窑各一座，炼磺炉由十几台增至二十五台，比原来都增加了一倍。工人（社员）由原来的一百零几个人，逐渐发展到现在的一百八十二人；家家户户都有人参加，甚至有的孤寡老太太、小孩子也参加了敲磺子的劳动。村中两个铁匠，参加进来给社里修理工具和给群众修理农具。同时，它的影响已超过了村的界限，二十几个外村群众，也来参加下窑开矿生产，他们的工资，也和本村一样，按劳力强度定分分红。
    煤矿产量，已较前大为增加。现在，每天平均出磺五百多斤，每斤折米三斤，共一千五百斤；产煤一万三千斤，折米一千六百斤。共可收入米三千一百斤左右。除去开支，每人每天平均净入三斤多米。随着劳力社的发展，全村群众的生活，也得到了空前的改善。
    “有了共产党，啥困难也能解决！”
    劳力社的发展、壮大和以上许多成绩的由来，是与共产党的领导和党员在生产中的模范作用分不开的。劳力社在群众中的影响日益扩大，党在群众中的威信也日益提高，党与群众的关系，也日益密切。由群众民主选出来的劳力社领导与管理人员中，可以明显看出群众对党的拥护。劳力社的经理和两个会计都是党员；四个窑头中三个是党员；八个组长，党员占了六个；去年年底选出的模范中，有党员二十四人，将近全体党员的一半。支部书记以前在工作作风上有些命令主义、态度生硬的缺点，但由于勇于自我批评，接受群众意见，改正错误，也博得了群众的拥护，能够被群众选为劳力社的经理，就是很好的证明。群众反映：“共产党领导成立劳力社，啥困难也能解决。”
