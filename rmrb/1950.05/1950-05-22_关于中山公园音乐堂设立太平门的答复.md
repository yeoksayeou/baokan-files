　　Reply Regarding the Establishment of Emergency Exits at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall
To the Editor:
    Regarding Mr. Liu Liangmo's suggestion in the People's Garden on May 10th that "Zhongshan Park Music Hall should establish two to four emergency exits and that the current wooden fence at the exit should be converted into a movable one," we agree with his opinion. The music hall originally had two emergency exits, but in the past, they were not well utilized due to inconspicuous signs. Since he made the suggestion, we have tried our best to utilize the emergency exits. The congestion after performances has improved. Whether it is necessary to add two more emergency exits is currently under study. As for the wooden fence at the exit, we feel that it is not only impractical but also unsightly, and engineers are currently designing its reconstruction. The music hall is a public place frequently used by everyone. We hope everyone can offer more opinions during this construction period.

### 关于中山公园音乐堂设立太平门的答复

　　关于中山公园音乐堂设立太平门的答复编者同志：
    五月十日在人民园地上，刘良模先生建议“中山公园音乐堂应设立两个至四个太平门。并且将目前出口之木栅改建成活动的。”我们同意他的意见。音乐堂原有两个太平门，但以前因标帜不显著，没有很好利用它们。自他提出建议之后，我们已尽量设法利用太平门。散场拥挤情形已有改善。是否有再增加两个太平门的必要，我们正在研究中。至出口之木栅门，我们感到不仅不切实用，并且也不美观，现在正由工程师设计改建中。音乐堂是大家时常利用的公共场所，在此修建期间，希望大家能多提意见。
