　　How to Make Dried Sweet Potato

To the Editor:
    I have heard that many farmers in North China do not know how to sun-dry sweet potatoes (including white potatoes) or make sweet potato flour into steamed buns. Sometimes, many sweet potatoes spoil, which is a real pity. Sweet potatoes are easy to plant and harvest, and the yield is very high. If each person could get an average of 600 catties per year, plus a little bit of coarse grains, they wouldn't have to go hungry from the eighth month of the lunar calendar to the wheat harvest of the following year (eight months). When sweet potatoes are harvested, the weather is still warm. They can be sliced or cut into pieces about 1.5 fen thick (approximately 4.5 millimeters), and they can be dried in three to five days. When needed, they can be ground into flour and steamed into buns or baked into pancakes, which are very delicious. If you can't finish eating them during hot weather, wash and dry them two or three times with cold water to prevent insect infestation, or press them into small pieces and store them, and they will not spoil. I am especially introducing this method to the farmers of North China.

### 怎样制红薯干

　　怎样制红薯干编辑同志：
    我听说华北很多地方农民不会晒红薯干（白薯在内），做红薯面馍；有时红薯坏的很多，实在可惜。红薯易种易收，产量最大。若每人每年平均得到六百斤，再加一点杂粮，从旧历八月，到第二年麦季这八个月的生活，就不会挨饿了。出红薯时，气候尚温暖，可将红薯刨成或切成约一分五的片，三五日就能晒干，用时轧成面，蒸成馍或炕成饼子都很好吃。若到热天吃不完，用冷水淘晒二三次，则不生虫，或压为碎片贮藏起来，也不会坏的。我特把这种办法介绍给华北的农民。
