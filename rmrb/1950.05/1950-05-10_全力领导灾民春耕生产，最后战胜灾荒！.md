　　In just over a month, the wheat harvest season will arrive. This year, most parts of the country have had suitable rainfall, and a good wheat harvest is expected. As long as the summer harvest is successful and autumn crops are widely planted, there will be a reliable material basis for overcoming the famine. The arduous days for the people in the severely affected areas and mildly affected areas across the country may then come to an end. Reports indicate that most of the land in the disaster areas nationwide has been sown. In the severely affected areas of Northern Jiangsu and Hebei, all land has been sown, and some mildly affected areas have even achieved intensive farming. This is a major victory on the production and disaster relief front, proving that our hardworking people, under the leadership of their government and the Party, and with the support of the people nationwide, are fully capable of saving themselves and have the power to overcome all disasters!
    Although the difficult times for the people in the disaster areas are nearing an end, they are still in a difficult phase. We must not be complacent in any way, which could lead to a relaxation of our leadership in the current production and disaster relief efforts. It should be recognized that this is the final stage of the struggle. If we fail to make every effort to help the people in the disaster areas solve various difficulties and promote a smooth transition to production, there is still a possibility of causing unexpected damage to the people in the disaster areas. The most important danger in the current disaster relief work is the use of dilatory and egalitarian working methods, instead of concentrating manpower and resources, seizing the opportunity, and solving the urgent difficulties of the disaster-stricken people in spring farming and production.
    What are the urgent problems currently existing in the disaster areas across the country?
    First, in the disaster areas where sowing has already taken place, there are still many uncultivated "tails" of land remaining, and the amount of wasteland is still quite large in some places. In some disaster areas in Shandong and other places, 20% of the arable land has not yet been planted. In Jibei County alone, as much as 100,000 mu of wasteland has been identified. The most wasteland is found in the households of revolutionary martyrs, military families, workers, the elderly and widowed, those who fled the famine, displaced people, and the sick. The reasons for the wasteland are partly due to a lack of food and seeds, and partly due to a lack of manpower and animal power. The main reason, however, is that the local governments, in leading production, have not deeply understood the living and production conditions of these more difficult households, and therefore have not used more effort to support them. Now, it is not too late, and this erroneous phenomenon can still be corrected. Therefore, after the general sowing in the disaster areas, investigating and eliminating wasteland has become an urgent task. Shandong and other places have now decided to investigate wasteland, and the army in Northern Anhui has been sent to the disaster areas to cultivate land on behalf of disaster victims unable to do so. Village cadres in rural areas of Northern Jiangsu have adopted the method of field inspections. These methods are all very necessary. We must do everything possible and mobilize all forces to support the disaster victims in planting their land well and earnestly solve their living difficulties, so as to facilitate their ability to cope with various tasks during the busy farming season.
    Second, in the areas where sowing has already taken place, the phenomenon of food shortages has already occurred during spring farming and sowing, and will continue to exist during the busy farming season in the future, because some areas in the past relied solely on the government and did not vigorously develop sideline production, and the masses had no savings. In some areas of Funing, Northern Jiangsu, some farmers are experiencing the phenomenon of pawning fields and selling unripe crops. In some areas, the masses are also prevalent with the idea of eating unripe crops. This is worth paying close attention to. Although the wheat seedlings are good this year, there is still a month before the wheat harvest. Therefore, the people's government must make careful plans for the people's food supply. The government should quickly and correctly use the disaster relief grain allocated by the central government to issue various spring loans and come up with comprehensive relief measures. Cooperatives in various places must effectively cooperate with disaster relief work. Recently, the exchange between urban and rural areas has decreased compared to the past, and the funds of many cooperatives are frozen due to slow-moving goods, making it impossible to purchase the products of the disaster victims. This is also a reason for the food shortage. In the future, cooperatives must systematically support the sideline production of the masses and provide the masses with various necessities at low prices. Although the busy farming season is about to begin, various places still need to seize the time to find various avenues for sideline production, develop free lending in rural areas, and make material preparations for the production of disaster victims. According to a survey by the Central Inspection Team in two severely affected townships in Northern Anhui, out of 884 households in Qingliu Township, 459 households were without food, and they were only maintaining their lives with wild vegetables and aquatic plants. The phenomenon of food shortage is widespread. The main reason is that most of the disaster victims did not engage in sideline production, and relied solely on relief grain without combining it with production. On the contrary, the disaster victims in the Tianjin Special Zone, a severely affected area in Hebei Province, earned 200,000 jin of rice from sideline production, solved their food shortage, recovered their strength, most of the famine refugees returned home, livestock increased, and the masses had a very high morale for production and overcoming the famine.
    Third, since April, there has been continuous overcast and rainy weather. Northern China generally celebrated widespread spring rain, and a good summer harvest is expected, but some disaster areas have experienced new floods on top of the old disasters. The disaster situation in Northern Anhui, Northern Jiangsu, and parts of Shandong has therefore become more serious. In Northern Anhui, the flooded wheat fields in Suxian and Funan areas alone reached more than one million mu. In the severely affected areas of Northern Jiangsu, such as the Donghu District of Huaiyin, all areas were flooded, and 150,000 people had nowhere to dig for wild vegetables and find food. The number of households without food in Huaibao County increased to one-third of the county's population. In some areas of Central and Southern Shandong, low-lying wheat fields were also affected by rain. The flooded wheat fields in Daxing and Baxian, Hebei Province, amounted to 55,000 mu. These disasters generally occur in severely affected areas, because the people in severely affected areas have been unable to withstand severe disasters after suffering from continuous years of disasters. Therefore, in areas where new disasters have occurred, we should concentrate all our efforts to rescue them and prevent the disaster from spreading. In areas where new disasters have not occurred, the leading organs must be vigilant at all times and organize various forces to effectively prevent them. Last year's floods were the most harmful, and there has been a lot of rainfall this spring, so we must pay special attention to using the method of "work as relief" to build water conservancy projects, repair dikes and dams, dredge and drain water, and prevent floods from happening again.
    All comrades working in disaster areas should soberly estimate that persisting in production and disaster relief is a long-term and arduous struggle. Only by leading the people to overcome the various difficulties in the current period between spring and summer harvest in the disaster areas, stabilizing the mood of the masses, and smoothly transitioning to production, can we fundamentally overcome the famine. We must resolutely oppose the conservative and empirical thinking of blindly pinning our hopes on the wheat harvest, ignoring the immediate difficulties of the masses, further strengthen production and disaster relief work, devote all our efforts to production and disaster relief, and lead the people to finally end the famine.

### 全力领导灾民春耕生产，最后战胜灾荒！

　　全力领导灾民春耕生产，最后战胜灾荒！
    现在，离麦收季节只有一个多月了。今年全国绝大部分地区雨水适宜，麦收有望。只要夏收接得上，再把秋庄稼普遍种好，战胜灾荒就有了可靠的物质基础，各重灾区和轻灾区的人民的艰苦岁月从此便可能结束。据报载全国各灾区大部土地均已下种。苏北、河北重灾区全部下种，有些轻灾区且已做到了精耕细作。这是生产救灾线上重大的胜利，证明我国勤劳的人民在自己的政府和党的领导及全国人民支援下完全能够自己救活自己，完全有力量战胜一切灾害！
    灾区人民艰难的岁月虽已接近结束，但目前仍在困难阶段。我们绝不可有任何自满，以致放松了对目前生产救灾的领导。应当认识，现在是斗争的最后关头。倘不能以全力帮助灾区人民解决各种困难，推动灾区顺利转入生产，那么，便仍然有可能使灾区人民招致意外的损害。目前救灾工作中最主要的危险，是用拖沓的平均主义的工作方法，而不是集中人力、物力，抓紧时机，去解决灾民春耕生产中的迫切困难问题。
    目前全国各灾区存在着什么迫切问题呢？
    首先是在已经下种的灾区，还遗留了很多未耕未种的“尾巴地”，荒地数目有些地方还很多。山东等地部分灾区有百分之二十的耕地尚未种上，济北一县已经查出有十万亩荒地之多。荒地最多的是烈、军、工属，鳏寡孤独，逃荒户，移难民以及病人。荒地的原因，有些是因为缺乏口粮、种籽，有的是缺乏人力、畜力。而主要的原因则是当地政府在领导生产时对这些困难较多的人家，没有深刻地了解他们的生活和生产情况，因而没有用更多的力量去支援他们。现在，时机还不太晚，这种错误现象还来得及纠正。因此，在灾区一般下种之后，查荒灭荒已成为一个紧迫任务。山东等地目前已决定查荒，皖北将军队开至灾区为无力耕作的灾民代耕，苏北农村村干部采用到田头检查办法。这些办法都是非常必要的。我们一定要想尽一切办法，动员一切力量支援灾民把地种好，并认真解决他们的生活困难，以利于他们在农忙时应付各种劳作。
    第二、在已经下种了的地区，由于有些地区过去单纯依靠政府，没有大力开展副业生产，群众中没有积蓄，春耕春种中即已发生缺粮现象，今后农忙，缺粮情况仍会继续存在。苏北阜宁的某些农民发生典田卖青现象，也有的地区群众中流行着吃早青的思想，这是值得十分注意的。今年麦苗虽好，但收麦尚有一月，因之，人民政府对于群众口粮问题必须作精细打算，政府应迅速地正确运用中央拨付的救灾粮发放各种春贷，并想出全面的救济办法。各地合作社必须切实配合救灾工作。最近城乡交流较前减弱，许多合作社资金为冷货冻结，无法收购灾民生产品，这也是缺粮的一个原因。今后合作社必须有计划地支持群众副业生产，并廉价供给群众各种必需品。现在农忙虽将开始，各地仍需抓紧时间，找寻副业生产的各种门路，开展农村自由借贷，为灾民生产作好物质准备。据中央视察组在皖北两个重灾乡的调查，青流乡八百八十四户，断炊者四百五十九户，仅以野菜水草维持生活，缺粮现象普遍，其主要原因是由于大部灾民没有进行副业生产，单纯依靠赈粮而没有与生产结合。相反的，如河北省重灾区天津专区灾民却从副业生产中赚了二十万斤米，解决了口粮，恢复了体力，逃荒户大部回家，牲口增加，群众生产渡荒情绪极高。
    第三、四月以来阴雨连绵，北方均庆春雨普降，夏收有望，但有一些灾区在旧灾之上又加上新的水灾。皖北、苏北，以及山东部分灾区灾情因此转趋严重，皖北仅宿县及阜南地区被淹麦田达百余万亩，苏北重灾区如淮阴东湖区全部被淹，十五万人口无处挖野菜觅食，淮宝县断炊户增达全县人口三分之一。山东鲁中南部分地区洼地麦田亦因雨成灾。河北大兴、霸县被淹麦田五万五千亩。这些灾害一般发生在重灾区，因为重灾区人民在遭受连年灾害之后，已无力抵御严重灾害的袭击。因此，在已发生新灾害的地区，应集中全力抢救，不可使灾情扩大。在未发生新灾害的地区，领导机关要随时警惕，组织各种力量切实防止。去年水灾为害最大，今春雨水又多，故要特别注意用以工代赈办法兴修水利，修堤补坝，疏水排水，防止水害再次发生。
    一切灾区工作同志都应当清醒地估计到：坚持生产救灾是一个较长时期的艰苦斗争，只有领导人民克服目前灾区青黄不接的时期中的各种困难，稳定群众情绪，顺利转上生产，这才能从根本上战胜灾荒。必须坚决反对只是盲目地把希望寄托在麦收上面，无视群众眼前的困难的保守的和经验主义的思想，进一步加强生产救灾工作，用全力投入生产救灾中去，领导人民最后结束灾荒。
