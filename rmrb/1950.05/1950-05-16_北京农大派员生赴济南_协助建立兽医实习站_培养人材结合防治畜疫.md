　　Beijing Agricultural University Sends Personnel to Jinan
　　Assists in Establishing Veterinary Internship Station
　　Cultivating Talent Combined with Prevention and Treatment of Livestock Epidemics
　　[Our Newspaper] Beijing Agricultural University recently, at the invitation of the Shandong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Jinan Agricultural College, dispatched veterinarian Wang Aijin, intern Fan Ni, and others, carrying medicines and equipment, to Jinan to assist in establishing a veterinary education internship station. The veterinary education internship station of Beijing Agricultural University is a type of internship organization that combines the cultivation of veterinary talent with the prevention and treatment of livestock epidemics for farmers. It was first established in June 1947 by the former North China University Agricultural College in Changzhi, Shanxi. The station has skilled veterinarians, teachers, and intern students who both teach and directly serve farmers. They study for half a day and intern for half a day. When diagnosing and treating livestock for farmers, no consultation fee is charged, and the medicine fee is only half price. The internship station also recruits students locally. When local students master the technology, the internship station is handed over to them for direct management as a permanent organization for the prevention and treatment of livestock epidemics in the area. This type of internship station has received enthusiastic support from local farmers and governments. Over the past three years, with the assistance of local governments, the Agricultural University has established 35 internship stations (excluding those that have been handed over to local self-management), distributed in rural areas of Shanxi, Hebei, and the suburbs of Beijing. Each station also organizes medical teams to go deep into the countryside to prevent and treat livestock epidemics for farmers every year. For example, this spring, the internship stations in the Beijing area cooperated with local livestock epidemic prevention work to inject 10,215 head of livestock. The Xingtai internship station has greatly assisted in the local prevention and control of cattle plague. At the same time, the internship stations also carry out livestock health care publicity and cultivate and transform rural veterinarians. For example, the Licheng internship station adopted various forms, such as broadcasting with loudspeakers and posting slogans in the market, to publicize methods of livestock breeding, management, and epidemic prevention. The internship station in the suburbs of Beijing assisted the local organization of a veterinary association to exchange experiences with two hours of study time every week to improve the technology of local veterinarians. The Changzhi work station assisted the Changzhi Special Zone in holding a short-term veterinary training class in early February. (Agricultural University Correspondence Group)

　　北京农大派员生赴济南
　  协助建立兽医实习站
　　培养人材结合防治畜疫
    【本报讯】北京农业大学最近应山东省农业厅和济南农学院之邀，派兽医王爱金，实习学生范霓等携带药品及应用器械，赴济南协助该地建立兽医教育实习工作站。北京农业大学的兽医教育实习工作站，是培养兽医人材与为农民防治畜疫相结合的一种实习组织。初创于一九四七年六月，由前华北大学农学院在山西长治试办。站内有熟练的兽医、教师和实习的学生，一面进行教学，一面直接为农民服务。每日学习半天，实习半天。为农民诊治牲畜时，不收诊费，药费只收半价。实习站并就地招收学员，当地方学员能掌握技术时，即将实习工作站全部交给他们直接管理。作为当地防治畜疫的经常机构。此种实习站获得各地农民与地方政府的热烈支持。三年来，在地方政府的协助下，农业大学已建立了实习站三十五处（另有一部分已交给当地自办，未计入），分布在山西、河北与北京郊区的农村中。各站每年又组织医疗队深入农村为农民防治畜疫。如北京区各实习站今春曾配合当地预防畜疫工作，注射牲口一万零二百一十五头；邢台实习站曾大力协助当地防治牛疫。同时，实习站又进行牲畜保健宣传与培养改造农村兽医的工作。如黎城实习站曾采取在集市上用筒子广播和贴标语等多种形式，宣传牲畜饲养、管理、防疫的办法；北京郊区实习站协助当地组织了兽医联合会，以每星期二个钟头的学习时间，互相交流经验，以提高当地兽医的技术；长治工作站曾协助长治专区在二月上旬举办了兽医短期训练班。（农大通讯组）
