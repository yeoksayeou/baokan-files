　　Seize the Season, Adapt to Farmers' Needs
    Lucheng Supply and Marketing Cooperative Prepares Summer Harvest Farm Tools
    Exchanges with County Cooperatives in Other Counties via Contracts
    [This newspaper, Lucheng News] The Lucheng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shanxi Province, according to the needs of the masses and in coordination with the season, is actively preparing for summer harvest work. Taking advantage of the opportunity for village cooperatives to borrow insecticides and improved varieties from the county cooperative, the cooperative conducted understanding and liaison work and decided to focus on assisting the wheat harvest through business, combined with the transformation of village cooperatives, from the second half of May to the end of June, a period of one and a half months. In early May, based on the needs and quantities of various places, the cooperative exchanged 17,745 catties of wheat from the Shahe County Supply and Marketing Cooperative for 845 mulberry forks through contracts; and exchanged more than 640 straw hats produced by the cooperative from the Changzhi County Supply and Marketing Cooperative for 400 winnowing fans. It is also preparing to order brooms, wooden shovels, and other wheat harvesting tools from the Shexian County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in the near future. In addition, it purchased 10,000 catties of miscellaneous oil and oil dregs (for autumn seedling topdressing) from the Xitiangong Oil Press in the county and is now urging the cooperative's tool factory to rush to manufacture sickles to meet the needs of cooperative members.
