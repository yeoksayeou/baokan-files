　　Central People's Broadcasting Station
Asks Listeners to Organize to Listen to Social Science Lectures
Xinhua News Agency, 8th. In order to make the broadcast of social science lectures a more effective tool to help everyone learn, the Lecture Section of the Central People's Broadcasting Station requires listeners across the country who listen to the station's social science lectures to organize themselves to listen and strengthen their connection with the Central People's Broadcasting Station.

According to a survey by the station, more than eighty units across the country that listen to social science broadcasts have established initial contact with the station. Listeners who are organized to listen are very serious about learning. For example, the Construction Office of the directly affiliated organs of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has 212 people participating in the study. They are divided into sixteen groups to listen separately, and the comrades responsible for leading the study come up with topics for everyone to discuss. However, some units have been affected in their listening and learning because they are not well organized or not organized at all. Therefore, the station requires listeners who are not organized to quickly organize themselves, and those who are already organized to improve and consolidate their organization, and strengthen leadership. Secondly, listeners are asked to strengthen their connection with the station, and it is hoped that the heads of each group listening to social science lectures will serve as the station's radio operators. The radio operators of social science lectures are responsible for organizing the people in the group to listen, promptly reflecting everyone's opinions and questions to the station, and reporting on the group's learning situation on a monthly basis. The station will be responsible for answering the questions raised by each group and improving the broadcasting work based on the opinions and requirements of the listeners.

    要求听众组织起来收听社会科学讲座
    【新华社八日讯】中央人民广播电台讲座科为使社会科学讲座的广播成为帮助大家学习的更有效的工具，要求各地收听该台社会科学讲座的听众组织起来收听，并加强与中央人民广播台的联系。
    据该台调查，全国各地收听社会科学广播的听众与该台建立初步联系的已经有八十多个单位。组织起来收听的听众，学习都很认真。如中共中央直属机关修建处，有二百一十二人参加学习，他们分成了十六个小组分别收听，由负责领导学习的同志拟出题目来给大家讨论。但是，也有些单位因为没有很好地组织起来或完全没有组织起来，影响收听学习的效果。因此，该台要求没有组织的听众赶快组织起来，已经组织起来的要把组织健全和巩固起来，并加强领导。其次，要求听众和该台加强联系，并希望收听社会科学讲座的各个小组的负责人，担任该台的收音员。社会科学讲座的收音员负责组织小组的人收听，及时把大家的意见和问题反映给该台并且按月报告小组学习的情况。该台将负责解答各组所提的问题，并且根据听众的意见和要求改进播讲工作。
