To the Editor:

　　Shanxi and Hebei provinces are both under the jurisdiction of the North China Region, so why is the implementation of stamp tax not unified? Recently, dozens of delivery notes from the Changzhi Grain Company in Shanxi Province transporting grain to the Wu'an County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Henan Province were found to have no stamps affixed. After arriving in Wu'an, they were discovered by the Wu'an Tax Bureau, which required them to affix stamps to all of them and told the company's grain receiving comrade stationed in Wu'an that if delivery notes were not stamped in accordance with regulations in the future, they would be treated as tax evasion. The comrade immediately sent a letter to the Changzhi Company, but as of the time I sent this letter, seven or eight days had passed, and the Changzhi Company had not yet replied, and the delivery notes sent were still not stamped as before. I don't know how to solve this problem, please answer.

Comrade Xue Baozhu:

Regarding the question you asked, the General Taxation Bureau of the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government replied as follows:

Shanxi and Hebei provinces are both under the jurisdiction of the North China Region, and the Stamp Tax Law is unified. The delivery notes issued by the Changzhi Grain Company for transporting grain to the Wu'an County Supply and Marketing Cooperative should be stamped per item in accordance with Item 15 "Transportation Contract Documents" of the North China Region Provisional Stamp Tax Regulations Tax Rate Table. It is correct for the Wu'an Tax Bureau to order them to affix all stamps and ask the company's comrade stationed in Wu'an to convey to the company that they must affix stamps in accordance with regulations in the future. The Changzhi Tax Bureau did not inspect the company's tax evasion and should make a self-criticism in its work; and it is illegal for the company to continue not affixing stamps.

### 长治粮食公司的送货车不该不贴印花税

　　长治粮食公司的送货车不该不贴印花税编辑同志：
    山西、河北两省同是华北区辖境，为啥在印花税执行上不统一呢？最近有山西长治粮食公司向河南武安县供销社运粮的送货单数十件，均未贴印花，到武安后，被武安税务局查获，让其全部按件补贴了，并对该公司驻武收粮的同志谈，今后再来送货单要不照章贴印花，按漏税论。该同志当即向长治公司去了信，但到我发此信时已七八日了，长治公司尚未答复，而且发来的送货单仍照旧未贴印花。这问题不知如何解决，请你们解答。
                                                  读者  薛宝珠薛宝珠同志：
    关于你所问的问题，经中央人民政府财政部税务总局答复如下：
    山西与河北两省同属华北区管辖，印花税法是统一的。长治粮食公司运粮到武安县供销社所开送货单，应依照华北区印花税暂行条例税率表第十五项“运送契约单据”按件贴花。武安税务局令其全部补贴，并请该公司驻武安同志转达该公司以后须照章贴花是对的。长治税局没有检查该公司漏税，应当在工作上做检讨；而该公司仍不粘贴印花，这是不合法的。
