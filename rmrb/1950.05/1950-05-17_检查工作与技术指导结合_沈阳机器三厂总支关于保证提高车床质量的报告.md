　　Combining Inspection and Technical Guidance
　　Report from the General Branch of the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory on Guaranteeing Improved Lathe Quality
　　Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory began producing lathes in April of last year. However, when the finished products were sent to various factories and mines for use, the comments received were all "poor quality." Soviet engineers called the lathes produced by the No. 3 Factory "scrap iron." Therefore, guaranteeing improved quality became the primary task of the factory's general branch.

　　What were the reasons for the poor quality? First, the leading cadres did not recognize the importance of improving quality. At the same time, they believed that improving quality was not a simple matter and must gradually progress along with the development level of industrial production. Consequently, they did not pay attention to establishing an inspection system or strengthening inspection work. They did not even set inspection standards, let alone have complete inspection tools. As a result, the factory made lathes for a year without knowing what problems existed or to what extent the quality standards were being met. Another deviation in the leadership's thinking was the belief that the No. 3 Factory's machinery and equipment were old and not precise, making it impossible to improve quality.

　　When the technical workers saw that the leadership was not paying attention to quality, they became careless in their work. Apprentices often handed over their work to their apprentices while they read newspapers or chatted with their workmates on the next lathe. Whenever quality was mentioned, the workers would emphasize: "The machine tools I use are ten or eight grades worse, how can I make something with only one or two grades of tolerance?" They also said: "Without dial indicators, micrometers, and accurate fixtures, how can we improve quality?" Especially when the bureau came to inspect, the workers would say: "We use calipers to measure and rely on our eyes to do the work, how can it meet your standards of using micrometers to measure!"

　　These ideological obstacles were the first hurdle to improving quality. The primary way to overcome this hurdle was to solve the ideological problems and the tool and instrument problems. After the higher authorities put forward strict quality requirements and thorough inspection methods, the leadership's erroneous thinking of not paying attention to quality was broken. Administratively, seventy or eighty micrometers and fifteen dial indicators were purchased, creating favorable conditions for solving the ideological problems of the masses of workers.

　　At this time, the general branch decided to make improving quality the central focus of the Party's work in the first quarter. The first item in the work plan stipulated that the product must meet inspection standards. A mobilization was carried out at the Party member meeting, explaining that poor quality was the biggest weakness of the No. 3 Factory. Party members and Youth League members were required to resolutely fight for improving quality. Party members were also required to lead the masses in humbly accepting inspections. If their work was deemed scrap during inspection, they should take it back for repair or scrap it and redo it without arguing. Only in this way could quality be improved and a strict inspection system established.

　　Among the masses of workers, the general branch launched propaganda and mobilization targeting the idea that the machines were old, not precise, and unable to improve quality: "When setting records, didn't everyone say that the machines were old and lacked power? But we have set many new records. What is the reason for this? The reason is very simple, we have the technology. We can come up with ways to overcome difficulties. In the past, we set many new records and received good reviews from all sides. Now we are criticized by all sides because of low quality. This requires all our workers to rise up, give play to our creativity, improve technology, overcome difficulties, and create new quality records." The general branch more clearly and affirmatively placed the responsibility of creating new quality records on the old and skilled workers. The general branch used the comments made on Zhao Guoyou when he set records to encourage them, saying: "In the past, when Zhao Guoyou set a new record, everyone said that Zhao Guoyou was willing to work hard, so he caught up with the good times. Now we require improving product quality, so the old and skilled workers must come up with their technology and work hard to catch up with these good times."

　　In establishing the inspection system and strengthening inspection work, the Party sent an outstanding Party member, Ren Binggong, to work in the inspection department. Under Ren Binggong's promotion, the work of the inspection department was completely renewed. There was no more bureaucratic style, and the inspection work was further combined with technical guidance work.

　　When the inspection personnel inspected a defective product, they carefully studied the cause of the defect and patiently told the worker. For example, when inspector Li Hongchang inspected the inner hole of the 1046 helical gear, he found that it was always slightly undersized. He told the worker: "When you are cutting the knife, eat the knife in, and then eat a small knife from the inside out, which can reduce the knife allowing and there will be no less." After the worker accepted this suggestion, the work he did was no longer less. Also, Yang Jinduo, when inspecting the 1194 axle gear, found that the inner hole and the outer skin were always inconsistent. He told the worker: "This work is important on one end and not important on the other. When you make it, first make the unimportant end, cut the inner hole and the outer skin in one pass, and then turn it over and cut the other end in one pass, and there will be no tolerance." After the worker accepted this opinion, there were no more defective products. The result of doing this not only strengthened the inspection work, but also made the workers feel that the current inspection was not simply picking faults, but also telling them where the errors were and how they should be done in the future. This could reduce defective products and waste of man-hours, and they could also learn technology and get extra bonuses. This working method of combining inspection and technical guidance changed the workers' long-standing aversion to inspection personnel and made them welcome inspections.

　　The inspection department also created a new working method, which was to not immediately put the inspected defective products into the defective product warehouse, but to hang a sign with the name on it and put it on display on the way to and from work that day. The result was that it further stimulated the workers to pay attention to quality. The workers reflected: "This is terrible. Look, if you do bad work, it is placed at the door and you feel sad when you see it going to and from work. The name is also written on it, indicating whether it is a worker defect or a material defect. It just doesn't say how many years of service and how many points (wage points). If it is written, it will be even more unsightly."

　　In the course of the work, the general branch paid attention to praise and encouragement at any time. In early March, when the Machinery Bureau's inspection section came to inspect, it inspected three machines and stamped them with the qualified steel seal. The leadership seized this opportunity. During the lunch break, the Youth League organized a band to congratulate the assembly shop, and the factory also issued a notice. At this time, the workers in the assembly shop boosted their confidence in striving for all machines to be qualified in March. Everyone took off their coats and waved their arms, working hard. Sure enough, all the lathes in March were stamped with the qualified standard steel seal.

　　The Party's workshop branch also held a joint meeting of Party members and Youth League members, and organized mutual assistance within the Party members and Youth League members. The first branch did a better job, organizing experienced Party members and Youth League members and young Party members and Youth League members into mutual aid groups, often inspecting each other and providing technical assistance. This ensured that the branch became the backbone organization for not producing defective products and reducing defective products. According to statistics in March, there were a total of sixty-five Party members in the factory who participated in lathe processing and production, and only two Party members each made one defective product.

　　The Party's internal reports also mentioned the situation of improving quality and reducing defective products every time, which further promoted the attention of the whole Party to this work.

　　Through the efforts of the entire factory, thirty lathes were produced in March, and all of them were stamped with the qualified steel seal. In January, when the bureau came to inspect, it only inspected seven machines and stopped inspecting because none of them could barely pass.

　　However, these achievements only mean that the assembled lathes are better than the previous month and the previous quarter. In terms of reducing defective products, saving expenses, and lowering costs, it has not been done well. This is still the direction and goal we will continue to strive for with our greatest efforts in the future.

### 检查工作与技术指导结合　沈阳机器三厂总支关于保证提高车床质量的报告

　　检查工作与技术指导结合
　　沈阳机器三厂总支关于保证提高车床质量的报告
    沈阳机器三厂从去年四月起开始生产车床，但所出成品拨到各厂矿去使用时，所得的评论都是“质量不好”。苏联工程师把三厂生产的车床称之为“废铁”。因而保证提高质量就成为三厂总支的首要任务。
    质量不好的原因在那里呢？首先是领导干部没有认识到提高质量的重要性。同时认为提高质量不是简单的事，必须跟随工业生产的发展水平逐渐前进，因而就没有注意建立检查制度与加强检查工作。甚至连检查标准也没有订出，更缺乏完善的检查工具。结果是工厂里做了一年的车床，不知道有些什么毛病，也不知道质量的标准到底达到了怎样的程度。领导思想的再一点偏差，就是认为三厂机器设备老、不精密，因而没法提高质量。
    技术工人们看见上边不注意质量，干起活来也就马马虎虎。有徒弟的常把活计交给徒弟去干，自己去看报，或是和邻床子的工友闲扯。只要一提质量，工人就强调说：“我使用的工作母机都差十道八道，怎么能做出只有一二道公差的活来呢？”还说：“没有千分表、千分尺和准确的制具，怎样能提高质量呢？”特别是局里来检查时，工人都说：“我们用卡尺量，眼睛看着做，怎能合乎你用千分表量的标准呢！”
    这些思想障碍是提高质量的第一个难关。冲破这个难关首要的是解决思想问题和工具仪器问题。当上级提出了严格的质量要求，和严密的检查办法后，打破了领导上不注意质量的错误思想。行政上又添购了七、八十个千分尺，十五个千分表，造成了解决工人群众思想问题的有利条件。
    这时，总支决定把提高质量当做第一季党的工作的中心。在工作计划上第一条就规定保证产品要合乎检查标准。在党员大会上进行动员，说明质量不高是三厂最大的弱点。党员、团员要坚决为提高质量而奋斗。并要求党员带动群众虚心接受检查。假如自己做的活检查时说废了，就毫不讲价钱的拿回去修理或报废重做。只有这样才能提高质量和建立严格的检查制度。
    在工人群众中，总支针对大家认为机器老、不精密、不能提高质量的想法，开展了宣传鼓动：“在创纪录时大家不是说机器老没有劲吗？但我们的新纪录却创了不少。这是什么道理呢？道理很简单，就是我们有技术。我们能想出办法克服困难。过去我们创了不少新纪录，得到了各方面的好评。现在我们因为质量低，受到了各方的批评。这就要求我们全体工友起来发挥创造性，改进技术、克服困难，创造质量的新纪录。”总支更明确而肯定地把创质量新纪录的责任，交到老而有技术的工友身上。总支以他们在赵国有创纪录时对赵的评语来鼓动他们说：“过去赵国有创了新纪录，大家不是说赵国有就是肯干所以他赶上了好行市。现在我们要求提高产品质量，这就得老而有技术的工友拿出技术来，再加上肯干来赶这个行市。”
    在建立检查制度加强检查工作中，党派遣了优秀的党员任秉公到检查室工作。检查室工作在任秉公的推动下焕然一新，再也没有官僚习气，并且进一步把检查工作与技术指导工作结合起来。
    当检查人员检查出废品时，就仔细研究废品发生的原因，并且耐心他告诉给工人。如检查员李洪昌在检查一○四六斜齿轮内孔时，发现多少总是有些少，就告诉工人说：“当你干活吃刀时把刀吃进去，回来再把刀由里往外的小小吃一刀，可以减少让刀就没有少了。”工友接受了这一建议以后，做的活就再也没有少了。还有杨金铎，检查一一九四轴齿轮时，发现总是里孔外皮不一致，就告诉工友说：“这个活是一头重要一头不重要，你制做时是先做不重要的一头，里孔与外皮一刀下来，然后再掉过来车那一头一刀下来就能没有公差。”工友接受这一意见后，再也不见有废品了。这样做的结果，不仅加强了检查工作，而且使工友们觉着现在的检查不单纯是挑毛病，而还告诉错误在那里，以后应该怎样做，既可减少废品和浪费工时，还可学到技术得到超额奖。这种检查与技术指导相结合的工作方法，改变了工友们历来讨厌检查人员的看法而欢迎检查了。
    检查室还创造了一种新的工作方法，就是把检查出的废品不立即入废品库，而挂上牌子，写上名字，即日就放到上下班的路上展览，结果更刺激了工友们注意质量。工友反映说：“这可不得了，你看做坏了活，放在门口叫你上下班看见难过。上面还写着名字，注明是工废是料废，就是没写多少年工龄和多少分数（工资分数），如果写上那可就更难看了。”
    在工作过程中，总支随时注意了表扬鼓励。三月上旬，机械局检查科来检查时，检查好三台并打上合格钢印。领导上便抓住了这个机会。中午休息时，青年团组织了乐队向装配场贺喜，工厂也出了通报。这时装配场的工友就鼓起了争取三月份台台合格的信心。每个人都脱了上衣挥动双臂紧张地工作。果然，三月份的车床台台都打上了合格的标准钢印。
    党的车间支部还召开了党员、团员联合大会，组织党员、团员内部的互助。第一支部作的较好，把有经验的党员、团员和青年的党员、团员编了互助组，经常互相检查并进行技术上的帮助。这就有把握地使支部成为不作废品和减少废品的骨干组织。据三月份统计，全厂参加车床加工生产的党员共有六十五名，只有二名党员每人做了一件废品。
    党内汇报每次也都谈到提高质量、减少废品的情况，这就更促使全党对这一工作的注意。
    经过全厂的努力，三月份生产三十台车床，台台都打上了合格的钢印。而在一月份里局里来检查时，只检查了七台就不检查了，因为没有一台能勉强通过的。
    但这些成绩仅是说装配起来的车床较前月前季提高了。而在减少废品、节省开支以降低成本方面，则还没有做好。这一点仍是我们今后以最大的努力继续争取的方向和目标。
