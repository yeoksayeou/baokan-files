　　Being an Enemy of the World People
　　U.S. Imperialism Frantically Expands Armaments and Prepares for War
　　Increased Military Spending by $350 Million to Maintain Nearly 600,000 Troops Stationed Overseas
    [Xinhua News Agency, 12th] Regardless of the firm wishes of the American people and the people of the world for peace, the Truman government is still stepping up its activities to expand armaments and prepare for war.
    According to U.S. Information Service news: In U.S. Secretary of Defense Johnson's report to Truman on April 24 regarding U.S. military preparations for the second half of this year, he admitted that the Department of Defense is "formulating a more compact and effective military organization" in order to carry out wars of aggression. Johnson also said without concealment that the United States is preparing to "defend" against radioactive, biological, and chemical warfare, and that "new weapons of the greatest military importance" are also "under development." Truman himself recently went to the army and air force bases in Georgia and Florida, reportedly to inspect the "combat readiness" of the U.S. armed forces.
    In order to step up the expansion of armaments and preparations for war, the House Appropriations Committee approved a bill on April 26, based on Johnson's recommendation, to increase military spending by $350 million for the 1951 fiscal year for the Air Force to purchase new aircraft. On May 4, the House Armed Services Committee, at the urging of warmongers such as Johnson, hastily passed a bill to extend the draft law for two years.
    In preparation for a new war, U.S. imperialism has stationed a large army abroad. According to a United Press report on April 29, quoting a U.S. Department of Defense spokesman, U.S. imperialism has stationed a large army abroad, especially in Japan and West Germany. Currently, the United States has 123,500 troops stationed in the Far East, the largest part of which is stationed in Japan. The United States has approximately 146,500 troops stationed in West Germany. In Wiesbaden, West Germany alone, the United States has 275 fighter planes, including a large squadron of jets. In addition, a large number of American troops are "serving in thirty-one military missions and advisory groups" abroad. The U.S. Department of Defense also admitted that all U.S. troops stationed overseas account for "more than 40 percent of the nation's three armed forces, nearly 600,000 people."

　　与世界人民为敌
　　美帝疯狂扩军备战
　　增加军费三亿五千万美元维持海外驻军近六十万人
    【新华社十二日讯】不顾美国人民与世界人民要求和平的坚决愿望，杜鲁门政府仍在加紧进行扩军备战的活动。
    据美国新闻处消息：美国防部长詹逊在四月二十四日给杜鲁门关于本年下半年美国军备的报告中，承认国防部正在“拟定一个更紧凑与更有效的军事机构”，以便进行侵略战争。詹逊并毫不隐讳地说：美国正在准备“防御”放射性、生物与化学战争，而“具有最大军事重要性的新武器”，亦“正在发展中”。杜鲁门本人最近亦曾亲赴乔治亚与佛罗里达州的陆空军基地，据说，他此行是去视察美国武装部队的“战斗准备状态”。
    为了加紧扩军备战，美众院拨款委员会已于四月二十六日根据詹逊的建议，通过增加一九五一年度军费三亿五千万美元的法案，以供海空军购置新飞机之用。五月四日，众院军事委员会又在詹逊等战贩的催促之下，匆忙通过延长征兵法两年的法案。
    为了准备新战争，美帝国主义已将庞大的军队驻在国外。据合众社四月二十九日电引美国国防部发言人的谈话透露：美帝国主义在国外，特别是在日本与西德，驻有庞大军队。目前，美国有十二万三千五百名军队驻在远东，其中最大部分驻在日本。美国共约有十四万六千五百名军队驻在西德。只是在西德的威斯巴登，美国就驻有战斗机二百七十五架，其中包括一大队的喷气式飞机。之外，还有大批的美军在国外“三十一个军事使团与顾问团中服役”。美国国防部同时承认：美国在海外的所有驻军共占“全国三军武装部队的百分之四十以上，近六十万人”。
