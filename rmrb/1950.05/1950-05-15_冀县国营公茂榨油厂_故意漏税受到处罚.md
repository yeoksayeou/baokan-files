　　Jixian County State-Owned Gongmao Oil Press Factory
　　Punished for Deliberately Evading Taxes

    [Our Newspaper Jixian News] The state-owned Gongmao Oil Press Factory in Matou Li Town, Fifth District, Jixian County, Hebei Province, has been punished by the county tax bureau for deliberately evading stamp tax. This factory is directly under the leadership of Hebei Provincial Industrial Company. Manager Wang Xinmin, despite repeated conversations with Zhang, the director of the Fifth District Tax Office, regarding government tax policies and stamp tax regulations, still ignored the payment of stamp tax. Director Zhang visited Manager Wang three times after the beginning of February and personally handed him a copy of the "Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax" for reference. However, Manager Wang still failed to earnestly implement government decrees. It was not until March 29, when the county tax bureau inspected the implementation of stamp tax in the Fifth District Tax Office, that they inquired at the factory. The factory's accountant, Yang, completely ignored them. The county bureau then began an inspection and discovered that thirteen of the factory's account books had not been stamped according to regulations. When asked why they had not been stamped, the factory personnel stubbornly argued, "We bought the stamps and prepared to affix them, but we hadn't yet." According to regulations, each of their account books should have been affixed with 5,000 yuan worth of stamps, totaling 65,000 yuan for thirteen books. In order to strictly enforce the law and learn from past mistakes to avoid future ones, the tax bureau decided to impose a penalty in accordance with regulations. In accordance with Article 21 of Chapter 5 of the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax, a fine of twenty times the amount of tax evaded, totaling 1.3 million yuan in Renminbi, was leniently imposed. The fine has now been paid. (Liang Fengkai, Fan Weijun, Jixian County Tax Bureau)

　　冀县国营公茂榨油厂
　　故意漏税受到处罚
    【本报冀县讯】河北冀县五区码头李镇国营公茂榨油厂故意偷漏印花税，已受到县税局处罚。该厂系直属河北省实业公司领导。经理王新民虽经五区税务所张所长与其三番五次交谈政府税收政策及印花税条例，但对交纳印花税仍置之不理。张所长从二月初以后，曾先后去拜访过王经理三次，并将“印花税暂行条例”手册一本亲自交给他以便作参考之用。但王经理仍未能认真执行政府法令。直到三月二十九日县税局为检查五区税务所印花税执行情况，到该厂询问时，该厂杨会计竟不理不睬。县局于是开始检查，发现了该厂有十三本账簿均未照章贴印花，质询为何不贴时，该厂人员竟强辩说：“买了印花准备贴没有贴上。”按条例规定，其账簿每本应实贴印花五千元，十三本计应贴六万五千元。税局为严明法纪，惩前毖后，决定按章予以处罚。按照印花税暂行条例第五章二十一条规定，从轻处以漏税额二十倍的罚金人民币一三○万元，现罚款已经缴纳。（冀县税务局梁凤楷、樊维钧）
