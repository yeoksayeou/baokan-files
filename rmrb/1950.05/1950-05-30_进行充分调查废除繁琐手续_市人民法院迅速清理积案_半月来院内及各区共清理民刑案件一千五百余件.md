Conduct Thorough Investigations and Abolish Cumbersome Procedures
Municipal People's Court Swiftly Clears Backlogged Cases
Over 1,500 Civil and Criminal Cases Cleared in the Court and Various Districts in Half a Month

[Report from this newspaper] According to news from the Beijing Municipal News Agency: The Beijing Municipal People's Court has cleared 1,551 backlogged cases in half a month, including 622 criminal cases and 929 civil cases from the court and various district trial groups. As the staff participating in the trials have become more proficient in their work and boldly created many new working methods, the efficiency of case closure has greatly improved. Only 540 cases were closed last week, while this week's closures increased to 1,011, almost doubling.

The vast majority of the staff assigned to the district trial groups have no experience in judicial work. Therefore, at the beginning of their work, most did not dare to make decisive decisions. The district trial groups initially summoned an average of about five or six to ten cases per day. In the past week, many districts have increased to more than thirty cases per day.

The increase in case closure efficiency is mainly due to the thorough investigation and research conducted by the trial staff before questioning, such as carefully reviewing the files, studying the case details, finding the crux of the case, summoning all relevant witnesses and material evidence, and drafting interrogation outlines. In this way, not only can detours be avoided during the trial, but also the correct solution can be accurately found. For example, some staff members in the ninth district spent five or six hours on a single court session in the first few days, but now it only takes half an hour to question these similar cases. Some district trial groups can even proactively set work plans for groups and even individuals, and handle cases according to their severity and urgency.

Combining Trial Investigation with Emphasis on Policy Propaganda

The working method of combining trial with field investigation has been widely used in the district trial groups. For example, in handling marriage cases, only by investigating the circumstances of abuse and oppression of one party, the feelings of both parties, and the family's economic situation at the parties' homes, neighborhoods, or other related parties can a relatively deep understanding be obtained, making it easier to make a more accurate judgment. Other cases, such as those involving housing and debt, are often resolved quickly and reasonably after field investigations. In the tenth district, a joint venture iron factory was on the verge of division due to mutual resentment and a dispute over the final accounts. This dispute had been dragging on for more than a year, during which time everyone failed to protect the machinery, and production was almost at a standstill. After the trial group invited staff from the Industry Bureau and the Trade Union to talk with both parties at the factory, along with the participation of workers, they persuaded both parties with the principle of developing production, leading them to make mutual concessions. As a result, an agreement was quickly reached. The trial group also supervised the implementation on-site, resolving any disputes that arose during the execution on the spot. Now one party has moved the machinery back to the factory and started installation, and it will soon be able to start production.

Emphasizing policy propaganda and conducting education during the trial process has enabled most cases to be resolved through mediation, and some parties have voluntarily withdrawn their lawsuits. In handling marriage cases and encountering divorce rulings, the man and woman often argue endlessly over the custody of the children. According to the Marriage Law, "The blood relationship between parents and children shall not be eliminated due to the divorce of the parents. After divorce, whether the children are raised by the father or the mother, they are still the children of both parents." After the trial judges patiently explained this clearly to them, the man and woman no longer argued and reached an agreement. In debt or property cases, due to the trial judges repeatedly explaining policies and clarifying principles, cases have reached reconciliation and even withdrawal, accounting for more than half of the total number of cases closed in various districts.

Breaking "Judicial Stereotypes" to be Realistic and Pragmatic

The creation and improvement of new working methods is also a factor in rapidly advancing the work. For example, changing the mediation agreement to a "file number slip" is a new creation in the court's working methods. In the past, for cases settled through mediation, the court would issue a mediation agreement, which required many complex procedures such as drafting, reviewing, writing, and stamping. By the time the mediation agreement was issued to the parties, the disputed matter had often been completely resolved. Some parties even said, "The matter is already over, why issue this?" In fact, according to past experience, those who voluntarily reach a mediation agreement rarely go back on their word and quickly implement it according to the terms of the mediation. Therefore, the actual significance (guarantee role) of the mediation agreement is not very significant. Now, a "file number slip" is issued instead. Whenever a case is settled through mediation, the content of the mediation is recorded in the mediation record, explained clearly to the parties, and their agreement is repeatedly obtained, allowing them to sign and seal or fingerprint the record, and a "file number slip" can be issued in court, stating the court division, file number, case handler, and parties, with each party holding a copy. If one party forgets the content of the mediation or fails to perform, the party can take the "file number slip" to the court to request finding the file to verify the record or request resolution. The court can quickly find the case or handle it based on the "file number slip" (if the content of the mediation is very complex and the parties cannot easily remember it, the court will proactively issue the parties a mediation agreement). Other changes, such as using a simplified judgment form for criminal judgments, have further broken the consistent and inherited "judicial stereotypes," reducing many unnecessary cumbersome procedures in the work and improving work efficiency.

### 进行充分调查废除繁琐手续  市人民法院迅速清理积案  半月来院内及各区共清理民刑案件一千五百余件

　　进行充分调查废除繁琐手续
    市人民法院迅速清理积案
    半月来院内及各区共清理民刑案件一千五百余件
    【本报讯】据京市新闻处消息：北京市人民法院半月内清理积案已达一千五百五十一件，其中包括院内及各区审判组的刑事案件六百二十二件，民事案件九百二十九件。由于参加审讯的工作人员对业务逐渐熟练，大胆创造了许多新的工作方法，结案的效率大大地提高了。上周结案仅五百四十件，而这一周结案提高到一千零十一件。差不多增加一倍。
    被派到各区审判组的工作人员，绝大多数对司法工作是没有经验的，因此在工作刚开始时，大都不敢果断处理，各区审判组起初平均每天传案约五、六件到十件左右，最近一周来，很多区里每天已增加到三十多件。
    结案效率的提高，主要是由于审讯工作人员在问案之前进行了充分的调查研究，如认真阅卷、研究案情、找到案件症结所在；传齐有关的人证物证以及拟出审讯提纲等。这样在审讯时，不但可以避免绕弯路，而且可以准确的找到结案办法。如九区有的工作人员在起初几天，开一次庭要化五、六个钟头，现在对这些类似的案件，却只需半小时就可问完了。有的区审判组更能主动的定出小组乃至个人的工作计划，并按照案情的轻重绥急，分别处理。
    审讯调查结合着重政策宣传
    审讯与实地调查相结合的工作方式，在各区审判组已被普遍的运用着。例如处理婚姻案件中，对一方受虐待、压迫的情况，双方当事人的感情以及家庭经济情形，只有到当事人家里或街坊邻居及其他关系人中去调查，才能了解得比较深刻，易于作出较正确的判断，其他如处理房屋和债务案件，很多是经过实地调查而获得迅速合理的解决。在十区有一家两股合营的铁工厂，因互相呕气就闹着要分家，算总账。这件纠纷拖延一年多了，在这期间大家都不保护机器，生产也近于停顿。经审判组工作人员邀请工业局和工会工作人员，会同双方当事人到厂里去就地谈话，并有工人参加意见，用发展生产的道理说服双方，使其互相让步，结果协议很快成立了。审判组人员并到场监督执行，在执行中所发生的争执当场解决，现在一方已把机器搬回工厂动手按装，不久就可开工了。
    在审讯过程中着重宣传政策和进行教育工作，使大部分案件经过调解就得到解决，有些案件的当事人自动的撤销诉讼。在处理婚姻案件而遇到判决离异时，男女双方往往为了争孩子而吵闹不休。按照婚姻法“父母与子女间的血亲关系，不因父母离婚而消灭。离婚后，子女无论由父方或母方抚养，仍是父母双方的子女”，经审判员向他们耐心解释清楚之后，男女两造就不再争执而达成协议。在债务或房产案件中，由于审判员反复地解说政策，讲明道理，而使案件达到和解乃至撤消的，在各区都占结案总数的一半以上。
    打破“司法八股”做到实事求是
    新工作方法的创造和改进，也是迅速推进工作的因素。例如：把调解书改为“卷号单”是法院工作方法的一个新创造。过去对于调解成立的案件由法院发给调解书，须经过拟稿、核稿、缮写、盖印等多项繁复的手续，等到调解书发到当事人手里时，往往是争执的事情早已完全解决，有的当事人还说：“事情早已完了，还发这个干什么？”而事实上根据过去的经验，凡是双方自愿调解成立的，都很少反悔，并且很快的就按照调解内容执行了。所以调解书的实际意义（保证作用）并不很大。现在改发“卷号单”，凡是案件成立调解后，把调解内容记在调解笔录内，给当事人讲说个一清二白，反复征得他们的同意，让他们在笔录上签名盖章或捺指纹，就可当庭发给“卷号单”，上面写着庭别、卷号、承办人和当事人，由当事人双方各执一份。遇到当事人有一方忘记调解内容或不履行时，当事人就可拿着“卷号单”到法院请求找卷查明笔录或请求解决，法院根据“卷号单”，可以很快的把案件查明或加以处理（如果调解内容很复杂，当事人不易记住的案件，法院就主动的再发当事人调解成立书）。其他如刑事判决书改用简易判决表，更是打破了一贯因袭相传的“司法八股”，使工作上减少了许多不必要的烦琐手续，提高了工作效率。（陈泓）
