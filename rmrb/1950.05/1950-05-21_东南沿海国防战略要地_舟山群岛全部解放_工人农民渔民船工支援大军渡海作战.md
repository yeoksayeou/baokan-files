　　Southeast Coastal Defense Strategic Stronghold
    Zhoushan Islands Entirely Liberated
    Workers, Peasants, Fishermen, and Boatmen Support the Army's Crossing-Sea Operation
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhoushan Front, 20th] The Zhoushan Islands were entirely liberated on the 18th. The People's Liberation Army Third Field Army's Zhoushan front troops, after landing on Zhoushan Island on the afternoon of the 16th, subsequently occupied Daishan, Changtu Island, Putuo Mountain, Zhujiajian, and other islands on the 17th and 18th. By the evening of the 18th, the Zhoushan Islands, a strategic stronghold for national defense on the southeast coast, were completely liberated. The "blockade" of Shanghai by the Kuomintang remnants based in Zhoushan has been completely shattered.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhoushan Front, 20th] The large-scale preparations for the People's Liberation Army's liberation of the Zhoushan Islands were completed with the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of the people in East China. After the complete liberation of the Zhejiang mainland last summer, the people of Zhejiang launched a wave of "supporting the army to quickly cross the sea." Tens of thousands of laborers from Yin County, Cixi, Yuyao, Zhenhai and other places worked day and night on the coast of eastern Zhejiang to build roads, transport wood, and build bridges, helping the People's Liberation Army complete the huge task of transporting war materials. Fishermen and boatmen on Jin Tang, Taohua, Daxie, and other islands, which were liberated only last autumn, also organized labor teams and boatmen teams to support the front lines.

    Technical workers also came from Shanghai, Hangzhou, Ningbo and other cities with their tools to the eastern Zhejiang front. They helped the People's Liberation Army establish motorized sailboat repair and manufacturing plants, taught many soldiers how to operate motorized sailboats and repair machinery, and built a large number of motorized sailboats.

    Workers and technicians assisted the People's Liberation Army in solving many technical difficulties in preparing for war. Workers, staff, and engineers on the Shanghai-Hangzhou, Shanghai-Nanjing, Tianjin-Pukou, and Jiaoji railway lines, with three or four months of arduous efforts, helped the People's Liberation Army transport ships from Shandong and northern Jiangsu to the eastern Zhejiang front by train.

    Thousands of boatmen actively taught commanders and fighters nautical knowledge and skills. A large number of soldiers became skilled sailors under their instruction. The boatmen also bravely undertook maritime transportation tasks under the harassment of enemy planes and warships. Some of them came from various coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, some escaped from Zhoushan, Daishan and other islands occupied by the Kuomintang remnants to join the People's Liberation Army, and others were eager to come from the liberated areas of Shandong and northern Jiangsu as liberated fishermen and boatmen. Because of the high level of awareness and active and responsible spirit they demonstrated in their work, many people have been rated as meritorious models.

　　东南沿海国防战略要地
    舟山群岛全部解放
    工人农民渔民船工支援大军渡海作战
    【新华社舟山前线二十日电】舟山群岛已于十八日全部解放。人民解放军第三野战军舟山前线部队，继十六日下午登陆舟山本岛后，复于十七、十八两日先后占领岱山、长涂山、普陀山、朱家尖等岛屿，至十八日晚，东南沿海国防战略要地的舟山群岛已告全部解放。国民党残匪以舟山为基地的对我上海的“封锁”，已被完全粉碎。
    【新华社舟山前线二十日电】人民解放军解放舟山群岛的大规模的准备工作，是在华东广大人民的热烈支援下完成的。当去年夏季浙江大陆全部解放后，浙江人民就展开了“支援大军、迅速打过海去”的热潮。从鄞县、慈溪、余姚、镇海各地来的成千成万的民工，不分昼夜地在浙东沿海修公路、运木料、架桥梁，帮助解放军完成了庞大的战勤物资运输工作。才在去年秋季后解放的金塘、桃花、大榭等岛上的渔民、船工，也组织了民工队、船工队支援前线。
    技术工人也从上海、杭州和宁波等城市带着工具来到浙东前线。他们帮助人民解放军建立机帆船修造厂，教会了很多的战士操纵机帆船和装修机器，并修造了大批机帆船。
    工人和技术人员协助解放军解决了在备战中的许多技术上的困难。沪杭、沪宁、津浦、胶济各铁路线上的工人、职员和工程师们，以三、四个月的艰巨努力，帮助解放军把山东、苏北的船只用火车载到浙东前线。
    数千个船工积极教授指战员们的航海知识和技术。大批的战士在他们教育下成为熟练的水手。船工们又在敌机敌舰骚扰下，勇敢地担任了海上运输任务。他们有的来自江浙沿海各处，有的是从当时国民党残匪盘踞着的舟山、岱山等岛逃出来投奔解放军的，有的则是争着从山东、苏北各老解放区来的翻身渔民和船工。因为他们在工作中所表现的高度觉悟和积极负责的精神，许多人已被评为功臣模范。
