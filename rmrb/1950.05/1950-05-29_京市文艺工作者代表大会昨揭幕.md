【Beijing Municipal News Agency News】The Beijing Municipal Literary and Art Workers Representative Conference grandly opened yesterday (the 28th) at the Labor People's Cultural Palace. More than 300 representatives gathered together. The meeting began at 9:30 AM. Wang Yaping, Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Literary and Art Circles, reported on the preparations, then the presidium of the conference was approved, and Lao She was elected as the executive chairman. After the chairman delivered the opening speech, Guo Moruo, Chairman of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles, and Vice-Chairmen Mao Dun and Zhou Yang spoke successively. Then, leaders and guests such as Weng Dujian, Zheng Zhenduo, Tian Han, and Xu Beihong also spoke. They unanimously wished the conference a success and hoped that the capital's literary and art circles would unite strongly and, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's literary and art thought, better carry out literary and art popularization work. Guo Moruo pointed out in his speech that after the National Congress of Literary and Art Workers, Beijing's literary and art workers did an important job - unity work. Guo called on everyone to unite, unite, and unite again! He also called on everyone to respond to the peace signature campaign, hoping that each representative would obtain the signatures of one hundred people. Mao Dun said: The tasks before our Beijing literary and art workers are multifaceted. We must cooperate with the government's literary and art policies and the needs of national construction to produce works that praise the labor enthusiasm of the emancipated workers and peasants and actively participate in production. Zhou Yang pointed out in his speech that literary and art work in Beijing should first serve the workers. We should organize and mobilize forces to go to the factories, closely integrate with production, and create new works. Then he pointed out: Literature should reflect the great changes of the Chinese people as masters of their own house, promote patriotism, educate the people to love their motherland, and guide the people to look forward. From 2:00 PM, the conference continued. Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended the meeting and delivered a speech. He first congratulated Beijing's literary and art work over the past year for its achievements in "developing the new and transforming the old." Regarding the future direction of work, he pointed out three points: First, literary and art workers should establish a closer relationship with workers. In the city, the main focus should be on workers, and the subject matter of creation should come from the workers and then return to the workers. Second, whether it is political work, economic work, or literary and art work, there is a general direction, that is, to proceed around the Common Program. Third, the attitude towards reforming the old is not to negate everything. Regardless of whether it is new or old, whatever is in the greatest interest of the greatest number of people is correct. Then, Wu Han reported on the "New Literary and Art Movement in Beijing before Liberation," and Li Bozhao, Vice-Chairman of the Conference Preparatory Committee, reported on the "Problem of Popularizing Literary and Art in Beijing." From beginning to end, the conference was conducted in a pleasant and tense atmosphere until the end.
