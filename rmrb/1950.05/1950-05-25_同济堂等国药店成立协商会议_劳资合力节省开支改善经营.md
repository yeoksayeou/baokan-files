　　Tongji Hall and Other Traditional Chinese Medicine Stores Establish Consultation Conference
    Labor and Management Work Together to Save Expenses and Improve Operations
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Xichengnian Hall and Tongji Hall traditional Chinese medicine stores in Beijing have formally established labor-management consultation conferences. Xichengnian Hall is one of the larger businesses in the traditional Chinese medicine industry, with three stores and approximately ninety employees in the city. After liberation, the labor-management relations in this company were relatively normal because of the existence of a labor-management business review meeting. After the establishment of the trade union last August, all employees demonstrated excellent performance in "uniting capital to improve business." According to the first industry-wide collective contract signed in the traditional Chinese medicine industry, in addition to wages, meals were provided by the employer: two meals of fine grains per day with a vegetable allowance of thirteen liang of millet. Considering the employer's difficulties, the employees of this company voluntarily changed the meals to two meals of cornmeal per day in the morning, and alternating meals of fine grains and dark flour in the evening, reducing the vegetable allowance to eight liang of millet per day. At the end of last year, the employees suggested to the employer that twenty-eight or nine rooms used for employee accommodation and storage of medicinal materials be returned to save on rent. Therefore, the employer usually respects the opinions of the employees. However, the employer, due to ideological concerns, has been unwilling to disclose the true business situation. Although the employees have consulted with the employer many times, hoping to further help the employer overcome difficulties, they were unable to do so. In March of this year, with the help of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Industry Union, the employer made the accounts public. According to the business situation in March of this year, the total income of the three stores was more than 50 million yuan; expenditures included more than 15 million yuan in debt interest, more than 14 million yuan in employee wages, plus employee meals and various miscellaneous expenses, leaving very little profit. This serious situation was the result of long-term losses before liberation. In the past, the employer felt that the situation was difficult to reverse, so they were unwilling to actively find ways to operate and even unwilling to talk to others about it, dragging it on.
    After the labor side understood the true business situation, the trade union immediately convened a meeting of employees to discuss and decided to help the employer overcome difficulties. After repeated consultations between the trade union and the employer, the employer, moved by the self-restraint of the workers, agreed to continue investing. The workers voluntarily further carried out frugality, with specific regulations: from March 21st to the end of April, meals were changed to two meals of coarse grains per day; half of the monthly wages were paid first, and the balance would be paid when the business improved. Recently, due to improved business, the arrangement was changed to one meal of fine grains every ten days, and twenty days' worth of wages were paid.
    This company has now formally established a labor-management consultation conference on the basis of the business review meeting.
    Tongji Hall Traditional Chinese Medicine Store is a joint-stock operation with more than fifty employees. Five shareholders serve as managers. Since liberation, the managers have been mutually irresponsible; the capital side intends to withdraw capital; and there are small clique phenomena among the workers. Labor-management relations are abnormal, and all aspects are chaotic, with business declining daily, and debts reaching more than 100 million yuan. The trade union of this company, adhering to the principle of "uniting capital to jointly develop production," educated the workers on the one hand and conducted consultations and negotiations with the capital side on the other hand. Currently, the company has undergone restructuring in management and operations, re-elected the chairman; reduced the number of managers; and formed a labor-management consultation conference. At the two meetings after the establishment of the labor-management consultation conference, the labor side, in addition to agreeing to carry out frugality, also proposed several methods to improve business operations, such as unifying sales prices; preparing to give preferential treatment to large orders; stipulating the time for opening and closing the doors every day; repackaging large bottles of honey into small bottles for easy sale; and the sales department carefully double-checking to avoid grabbing the wrong medicine; workers taking two hours of rest every day in the summer, etc. The capital side adopted all these reasonable suggestions from the workers, and some have already been implemented.

### 同济堂等国药店成立协商会议  劳资合力节省开支改善经营

　　同济堂等国药店成立协商会议
    劳资合力节省开支改善经营
    【本报讯】京市西鹤年堂与同济堂两国药店已正式成立劳资协商会议。西鹤年堂是国药业中较大的一家，在全市有三处铺面，职工约九十人。解放后，该号因早有劳资业务检讨会的组织，劳资关系比较正常。去年八月，该商号工会成立后，全体职工在“团结资方搞好业务”上更有了良好的表现。按照国药业首次签订的行业集体合同，除工资外，伙食由资方供给：每日两顿细粮，十三两小米的菜金。该商号的职工照顾资方困难，主动将伙食改为每日早上吃二米饭，晚上隔天吃一顿细粮一顿黑面，菜金降为每日八两小米。去年年底，职工又向资方建议，将供职工住宿和存放药材的二十八、九间房退掉，节省房租开支。因此，资方平日也比较尊重职工意见。但资方因思想上存有顾虑，一直不愿将真实营业情况公开。职工虽与资方协商多次，想进一步帮助资方解除困难，但终无从着手。今年三月，在国药业工会的帮助下，资方把账目公开了。以今年三月营业情况来看，三个铺面共收入五千多万元；支出欠债利息一千五百多万元，职工工资一千四百多万元，再加上职工伙食及各种杂支，所剩无几。这一严重情况，是解放以前长期赔累的结果。过去资方因觉得局面不易扭转，就不愿积极设法经营，更不愿向别人谈论，一直拖延下来。
    劳方在了解了真实营业情况后，工会立即召集职工开会讨论，决定帮助资方克服困难。工会与资方多次协商后，资方在工人克己精神的感召下，同意继续投资。工人则自愿进一步开展节约，具体规定：从三月廿一日到四月底，伙食改为每日两顿粗粮；每月工资先发一半，营业好转时再补发。近因营业好转，才改为十天一顿细粮，工资发二十天的。
    该商号现已在业务检讨会的基础上，正式成立了劳资协商会议。
    同济堂国药店为合股经营，共有职工五十余人。五个股东出任经理。解放以来，经理互不负责；资方打算抽资；工人则有小集团现象。劳资关系不正常，各方面都很紊乱，营业日见衰下，负债竟达一亿余元。该商号工会本着“团结资方共同发展生产”的原则，一面教育工人，一面与资方进行协商交涉。目前该商号在经营管理上已进行改组，改选了董事长；减少了经理的数目；组成了劳资协商会议。在劳资协商会议成立后的两次会上，劳方除同意开展节约外，并提出了改进业务经营的几项办法，如统一售货价格；对大批货单准备予以优待；规定每日上下门的时间；将大瓶蜂蜜改装小瓶，便于售卖；营业部仔细对方以免抓错药；工人夏季每日休息两小时等。资方对于工人的此种合理建议均予以采纳，有的并已开始实行。
