　　Wheat Sawfly Larvae Extermination Methods
　　Ouyang Junhan
　　In Xiaohuangzhuang and other villages in the 17th district of Beijing's suburbs, wheat sawfly larvae were discovered on wheat seedlings on April 22nd. The government led the masses to actively capture and kill them. Now, we introduce two insecticidal methods created by the farmers themselves:

　　1. Manual Capture Method (created by Tian Huanzi of Xiaohuangzhuang Village): Use your left hand to hold a dustpan (a flour sieve can also be used), and your right hand to hold a broom. Place the dustpan close to the roots of the wheat, shake the middle of the seedlings, and use the broom to sweep the pests into the dustpan. This method is much faster than catching them by hand. On the afternoon of April 27th, three hundred people in Anwai First Street caught 73 and a half catties in one and a half hours.

　　2. Chemical Insecticide Method (co-created by Chang Deshan and Ren Run of Dewai Fourth Street): A. Ingredients: four liang of red alum, one piece of black soap, one hundred catties of cold water, and one or two catties of boiling water. B. Preparation method: First, grind the red alum into a fine powder (the finer the better, it must pass through a sieve), mix it with boiling water, then chop the soap into small pieces, add water, and boil it into a liquid. Mix it with the red alum water, and then add one hundred catties of cold water and stir well before use. C. Usage: Before dusk, carry the prepared solution in buckets to the wheat field, use a watering can to fill with the solution, and spray it on the wheat seedlings (do not spray too much, for fear of burning the wheat leaves). The finer and denser the water outlet holes on the watering can, the better. D. Efficacy: This one dose of medicine can spray one mu of wheat. According to the test results, most of the insects will die the next day after spraying, and a small part will also be dying. (It is estimated that the medicine may not have been sprayed evenly or that less was sprayed, and that they ate less of the medicated wheat leaves.)

　　麦叶蜂幼虫捕杀法
    欧阳俊汉
    京郊十七区小黄庄等村于四月二十二号发现麦苗生有麦叶蜂幼虫，政府领导群众积极捕打。今将农民自己创造的两种杀虫办法介绍如下：
    一、人工捕捉法（小黄庄村田焕子创造的）：用左手拿一个簸箕（筛面箩亦可），右手拿一把扫帚，将簸箕靠近麦根，抖动苗的中部，以扫帚将害虫扫入簸箕中。此法比单用手捉快得多，安外第一街三百人，四月二十七日下午在一点半钟内，即捉了七十三斤半。
    二、药品杀虫法（德外四街常德山、任润二人共同创造的）：甲、原料为红矾四两，黑肥皂一块，凉水一百斤，开水一、二斤。乙、配制法：先将红矾轧成细末（愈细愈好，须过箩），用白开水冲过，再将肥皂切碎加水熬成液体，与红矾水放在一起，再将一百斤凉水兑入搅匀，即可使用。丙、用法：于黄昏前将配好的药水用桶担到麦田，用喷壶装入药水，往麦苗上喷射（不要过多，怕将麦叶烧坏），喷壶上的出水洞愈细愈密愈好。丁、效能：此一药剂量能喷一亩麦子。经试验的结果，喷射后次日，大部分虫子即可死掉，另有一小部亦奄奄待毙。（估计可能是药水没喷匀或少，他吃到受药的麦叶少）
