Freight Trains Should Pay Attention to Rain and Wind Protection Equipment
    I have seen freight trains several times with mats on top that were not tightly sealed, leaving the goods exposed. If it rains, the goods may be damaged. I suggest that the Ministry of Railways should strictly inspect the rain and wind protection equipment of freight trains to avoid the loss of state property.

　　运货列车应注意防雨防风设备
    我几次看到运货列车，顶上席子缝盖不严，使货物暴露在外，如遇到雨天，货物就可能损坏。建议铁道部应严格检查运货列车的防雨防风设备，以避免国家资财的损失。
