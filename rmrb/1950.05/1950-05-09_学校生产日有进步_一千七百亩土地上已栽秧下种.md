　　School Production Day Sees Progress
    Planting and Sowing Completed on 1,700 Mu of Land

    [Beijing News Agency] The teachers and students of 87 schools (13 universities and 74 middle schools) in Beijing engaged in vegetable production have planted and sown on over 1,700 mu of state-owned land in the suburbs. Approximately 36,000 teachers and students participated in the production (over 9,200 from universities and over 27,000 from middle schools). As of now, 79 schools have received loans, totaling 337,000 jin of millet. The average loan per mu for each school is highest for Sino-French University at 812 jin and China University of Technology at 727 jin; the lowest are Gengxin Middle School at 19 jin and Yuying Middle School at 40 jin. The vast majority of the land has now been planted and sown. A small number of schools previously did not pay attention to production, had poor labor discipline, and were poorly managed. After inspection, concrete solutions were found through means such as holding general meetings, small-scale seminars, or exchanging opinions on-site, and most have improved. Among them, for land where vegetable cultivation was not widespread due to insufficient water sources, the production committee proactively provided loans to dig new wells or install water pipes in old wells to strive for more vegetable cultivation.

    The School Production Committee conducted a general inspection. Currently, the Municipal Girls' No. 2 Middle School, Girls' No. 4 Middle School, North China Middle School, and the No. 2 and No. 3 sections of the Normal University Affiliated Middle School are operating relatively well, while Yude, Confucius Education, and Xiang'an Midwifery schools are operating poorly. All school land is generally planted with vegetables. Some, due to soil and water conditions unsuitable for vegetable cultivation, have been approved by the production committee to switch to planting cotton, corn, potatoes, and other crops; a small number of schools initially sought convenience, reduced investment, and were perfunctory, even planting the above crops on land suitable for vegetables, which needs to be adjusted next season.

    All land is generally operated independently, except for two pieces of land in Dapaizi and Liuhezhuang in the southern suburbs, totaling 220 mu, which are collectively operated by 11 schools including the Normal University Affiliated Middle School and Municipal No. 6 Middle School; the 175 mu inside the Temple of Heaven are collectively operated by 8 schools including Municipal Girls' No. 1 Middle School and Duzhi Middle School. Some schools have not carefully studied management methods and economic calculations. For example, the Academy of Fine Arts used four long-term laborers for 17 mu of land (a portion of which has not been developed, with only 12 or 13 mu actually used), the Swastika Middle School used two workers for 6.5 mu of land, and the Huaguang Girls' Middle School used two exchange laborers for 6 mu of land. Therefore, students have fewer opportunities to go to the land, and even when they do, they feel there is no work to do. The No. 2 branch of the Xinsheng Middle School in the 17th District's Gounihe area was allocated 30.02 mu of land with 13 mu of wheat on it. The land was very good, but because they did not follow the production committee's advice to apply fertilizer and cultivate, there was little harvest.

### 学校生产日有进步  一千七百亩土地上已栽秧下种

　　学校生产日有进步
    一千七百亩土地上已栽秧下种
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市种菜生产的八十七校（大学十三校，中学七十四校）的教职员学生已在近郊一千七百余亩国有土地上栽秧下种。参加生产的教职员学生共约三万六千余人（大学九千二百余人，中学二万七千余人）。截至目前已贷款者七十九校，共贷得小米三十三万七千斤。各校贷款每亩平均数字最高者为中法大学八百一十二斤，华大工学院七百二十七斤；最少者为耕莘中学十九斤，育英中学四十斤。现在绝大部分土地已栽秧下种。有少数学校过去不重视生产，劳动纪律不好，经营不得法，经检查后，通过开大会、小型座谈会或就现地交换意见等方式，找出具体解决办法，大部均已有改进。其中因水源不足不能普遍种菜的土地，经生产委员会主动地贷款打新井，或在旧井里下水管，争取多种蔬菜。
    学校生产委员会曾进行普遍检查。目前情况以市立女二中、女四中、华北中学、师大附中二、三部经营的较好，经营较差的有育德、孔教、向安助产等校。各校土地基本上均种蔬菜，有的因土质和水源关系不宜种菜者，经生产委员会批准，改种棉花、玉米、马铃薯等作物；有少数学校起初图省事、少投资，敷衍，把能种菜的地亦种了上项作物，须等待下季予以调整。
    所有土地一般的都独自经营，仅南郊大泡子、六合庄两处土地计二百二十亩，系由师大附中、市立六中等十一校集体经营，天坛内一百七十五亩系由市立女一中、笃志等八校集体经营。有的学校没有好好研究经营方法和经济计算，如美术学院的十七亩地（一部分尚未开出，实际仅有十二、三亩）已用了四个长工，卍字中学六亩半地，用工人二名，华光女中六亩地，用变工二人。因此，学生到地上去的机会比较少，即使去了也感到无工作可做。新生中学二院在十七区沟泥河分得土地三十亩零二分，地上有麦子十三亩，土地很好，因没按生产委员的意见去追肥、中耕，以致没有什么收获。
