　　Ninghe Women Go to the Fields to Produce, Resolving the Contradiction Between Spring Farming and River Work
    [Ninghe News] In Ninghe, Hebei, a large number of women participated in field labor, freeing up men to participate in river digging, resolving the contradiction between spring farming and river repair work. This spring, in order to complete the task of digging the "New Chao Bai River," the county mobilized 9,000 laborers, requiring 50 days. This was the time for fully launching spring plowing, sowing, and weeding, and the manpower and animal power were severely lacking. Therefore, widely mobilizing women to participate in field production was an important guarantee for completing the above three tasks. To this end, the county women's federation convened a meeting of women cadres from the entire county on March 25 to study the current situation of women's work, and formulated plans for women's field labor based on the different conditions of the county and districts. In early April, each district held village women cadres' forums in batches, introducing experiences in mobilizing women to participate in production, mobilizing cadres to take the lead in production, and striving to be labor models. Li Yuzhen, director of the women's association of Da Zhao Village in the Sixth District, said, "As long as we are determined, there is nothing we cannot do. I guarantee to organize the women and mobilize them to mobilize men to participate in river digging."
    Due to the strong promotion from the leadership and the active leadership of the cadres, and with the publicity of "Labor is glorious," the ideological concerns of being ashamed to participate in production, fearing getting clothes dirty or torn, and thinking that they could not do it were broken down, and women were quickly mobilized. In the eight districts and 192 villages of the county, 4,589 women participated in field labor. For example, in the nine villages of the First District, out of 467 female laborers, 372 have been mobilized to participate in spring sowing, using human power instead of livestock to pull plows, averaging 1.2 mu of land sown per person per day. In just ten days, 4,650 mu of sorghum were planted. In Jiedao Gu Village, 40 male laborers participated in river digging, and the women's director Wang Yuzhen (a party member) led 92 women in the village to freely form nine groups on the existing basis, implementing male-female exchange of labor, human power replacing animal power, and mutual assistance between human and animal power, launching field labor such as weeding wheat, planting beans, and planting sorghum. Now, the sowing of the whole village is almost completed. In Xiaohaibei Village, Third District, 200 of the 300 women in the village participated in field production, even the old women in their sixties went to the fields. Women in the Sixth District villages launched a campaign of "comparing labor and seeing the results in autumn." Li Yuzhen, director of the women's association of Da Zhao Village, mobilized women to challenge men: mobilizing men to dig rivers, and women at home will guarantee that the land will not be barren. Under their influence, 25 laborers volunteered to dig rivers, and another 25 went to work on state-owned farms. In this way, the entire village's land (663 mu) completely relied on women for cultivation and weeding. In order to take on the agricultural production of the entire village, 37 women freely formed seven mutual aid groups. In less than eight days, they had weeded 344 mu of wheat seedlings once, and are now planting autumn crops. Due to the active production of women in the county, the contradiction between spring farming and spring work has been resolved, ensuring the peace of mind of the river digging laborers. At the same time, some districts have also drawn surplus labor to work. For example, in 38 villages in the Sixth District, 950 women participated in production, replacing 1,600 male laborers to participate in work on state-owned farms, earning 12,800 jin of corn per day (8 jin per person per day), which can solve the livelihood of 6,400 people.

　　宁河妇女下地生产
    解决了春耕与河工的矛盾
    【宁河讯】河北宁河广大妇女参加田间劳动，抽出男子参加挖河，解决春耕与修河工矛盾。该县今春为完成挖“新潮白河”的任务，曾动员了九千民工参加，需时五十天。此时正是全面开展春耕、春种、春锄的时候，而人力畜力又严重缺乏，所以广泛发动妇女参加田间生产，是完成以上三件工作的一个重要保证。为此，县妇联会在三月二十五日召集了全县妇女干部研究当前妇女工作情况，根据县、区不同情况作出了妇女田间劳动的计划。四月初各区又都前后分片召开了村妇女干部座谈会，介绍了发动妇女参加生产经验，动员干部在生产中起带头作用，争取当劳动模范。六区大赵庄妇女主任李玉珍说：“只要下决心，没有办不了的事，我保证把妇女组织起来，并发动妇女动员男子参加挖河。”
    由于领导上的有力推动和干部的积极带头，以“劳动光荣”的宣传，打破了参加生产羞耻、怕将衣服弄脏弄破、认为自己干不了等思想顾虑，很快的将妇女发动起来，全县八个区一百九十二个村，即有四千五百八十九名妇女参加了田间劳动。如一区九个村四百六十七名女劳动力中已发动起三百七十二名参加了春种，以人力代替牲畜拉耠子，平均每天每人播种一亩二分地，仅十天时间就种上高粱四千六百五十亩。捷道沽村有四十名男劳动力参加挖河，妇女主任王玉珍（党员）即领导着全村九十二名妇女在旧有的基础上自由组成了九个小组，实行男女换工、人力代替畜力、人畜力互助，展开了锄麦、种豆、种高粱等田间劳动。现全村播种已近全部完成。三区小海北村，全村三百名妇女就有二百名参加了田间生产，连六十岁的老大娘也下了地。六区村与村的妇女在展开“比劳动秋后见”的运动。大赵庄妇女主任李玉珍发动妇女向男子挑战：动员男子去挖河，妇女在家保证不荒地。在她们影响下有二十五名民工自愿去挖河，还有二十五名去国营农场做工，这样全村土地（六百六十三亩）完全依靠了妇女耕种锄耪。她们为担负起全村农业生产，有三十七名妇女自由结成七个互助小组。不到八天就将三百四十四亩麦苗锄过一遍，现正在种植秋庄稼。由于该县妇女的积极生产、春耕与春工的矛盾已获解决，保证了挖河民工的安心工作。同时，有的区还又抽出多余的劳力去作工，如六区三十八个村有九百五十多名妇女参加了生产，即替出一千六百名男劳力参加国营农场作工，每天赚玉米一万二千八百斤（每人每日赚八斤）可解决六千四百口人的生活问题。（泽林、韩凤臣、马玉金、张云琴）
