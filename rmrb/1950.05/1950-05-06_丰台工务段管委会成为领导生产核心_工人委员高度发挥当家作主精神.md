　　Fengtai Railway Section Management Committee Becomes Core of Production Leadership
　　Worker Committee Members Highly Develop Their Spirit of Being Masters
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Since the Fengtai Railway Section of the Tianjin Railway Bureau convened a staff and worker representative meeting on June 25th of last year and formally established a Management Committee, it has gradually transformed the bureaucratic style of administrative leadership in the past, making the Management Committee a true core of production leadership. Before the establishment of the Management Committee, the section chief and heads of various sections spent more than 70% of their time on administrative work, and thus could not devote all their efforts to leading production. After the establishment of the Management Committee, meetings were used to gather opinions from the Party, government, labor union, leaders, and the masses, closely integrating with the front lines, which powerfully promoted production. Last year, the section launched a production and frugality campaign, and the new plan formulated by the Management Committee after discussion increased the workload by 40% compared to the original draft. Due to the adoption of the suggestion from worker committee member Wang Shunqing to return old rail spikes (in the past, old rail spikes were discarded attached to the sleepers; it was estimated that half of them could be reused), based on the section’s use of 120,000 rail spikes last year, 10,000 catties of rice could be saved annually. Under the leadership of the Management Committee, the section has established a series of working systems for management responsibility, material distribution, work inspection, and warehouse inspection, so that the work in all links has been greatly improved compared to the past. Due to the realization of democratic management, the production enthusiasm and creativity of the workers have been further brought into play. For example, Dong Yuxiang, the track foreman of Langfang, successfully transformed flatcars and hand-cranked cars, solving the transportation problem of the track maintenance area. The proactive suggestions made by bricklayer Wang Wenchao within half a year have saved materials worth at least 5,000 catties of rice.
　　Of the seventeen members of the section's Management Committee, eight are worker members and nine are staff members. Since its formal establishment on June 25th of last year, it has held a total of 25 meetings. The main tasks of the Management Committee are to grasp work plans, inspect production and frugality campaigns, evaluate positions and salaries, personnel transfers, lead learning, and promote the new track maintenance method. In order to cultivate the enthusiasm of worker committee members to be masters of their own affairs, the administrative leaders of the section have made many efforts: At the first Management Committee meeting, the administrative leaders first made self-criticisms, reviewing the shortcomings in their past work, and encouraged worker committee members to put forward criticisms and opinions, in order to eliminate the gaps that existed between staff and workers in the past and strengthen unity among the members. At the second meeting, the heads of each production unit reported the overall business and work of the section to the worker committee members, so that they could understand the situation and be better able to be masters of their own affairs. At that time, they raised many situations that the higher-ups did not understand. In order to cultivate the work confidence of worker committee members, at each meeting, the leadership paid attention to guiding the worker committee members to speak more from the sidelines, avoiding presenting them with pre-determined drafts at once, or making sweeping statements. The worker committee members quickly changed the situation of not speaking, and worker committee members Wang Shunqing, Zhang Renqi, Tang Fengyi, Shi Jingrong and others became experts in track maintenance planning and management.
　　In order to further strengthen business leadership, starting in 1950, the members of the section's Management Committee implemented a division of labor and established four research groups, which take turns inspecting one work department every half month, including inspecting the degree of work completion, studying the shortcomings, and pointing out active improvement methods, which have now achieved preliminary results. For example, the material stock ledger of the material section could not be reported monthly in the past, and the ledger balance did not match the actual goods. After the Management Committee's inspection and assistance, the conservative ideas of the cadres were resolved, a clear division of labor was implemented, and warehouse management was strengthened. Now the materials are stored in good order, and the accounts that could not be calculated in the past two months can now be completed in half a month.

　　丰台工务段管委会成为领导生产核心
    工人委员高度发挥当家作主精神
    【本报讯】天津铁路局丰台工务段自去年六月二十五日召开职工代表会议，正式成立管理委员会以来，逐步地转变了过去行政领导上的事务主义作风，使管委会真正成为领导生产的核心。该厂在成立管委会之前，段长和各股负责同志所处理的事务工作，常占百分之七十以上，因而不能以全力领导生产。成立管理委员会后，通过会议汇集党、政、工及领导和群众各方面的意见，密切与现场结合起来，有力地推进了生产。去年该段开展生产节约立功运动，经管委会讨论制订的新计划，较原草案提高工作百分之四十。由于接受了工人委员王顺清交回旧道钉的建议（过去旧道钉连在枕木上废置了，据估计其中有一半可利用），按去年该段共用道钉十二万个计算，一年可节省米一万斤。在管委会领导下，该段已建立起管理负责、材料配发、验工、仓库检查等一系列的工作制度，使各环节的工作都较前有很大改进。由于民主管理的实现，工人的生产积极性和创造性得到进一步发挥。如廊房铁工长董玉翔改造平车及手摇车成功，养路工区的运输问题得到解决。瓦工长王文超在半年内所提的积极建议，节省材料至少可折米五千斤。
    该段管委会十七个委员中，工人委员共八人，职员九人。从去年六月二十五日正式成立，至今共开会二十五次。管委会的主要任务是掌握工作计划，检查生产节约运动，评职评薪，人事调动，领导学习及推行新养路法等。为培养工人委员发挥当家作主的积极性，该段行政负责同志曾做了很多的努力：在第一次管委会上，行政负责同志首先作了自我批评，检讨了过去工作上的缺点，启发工人委员提出批评和意见，以消除过去职工间所存在的隔膜，加强委员间的团结。第二次开会时，即由各生产单位负责人向工人委员报告全段业务和工作，使他们了解情况，便于当家作主。当时他们便提出了很多上面所不了解的情况。为培养工人委员的工作信心，每次会议时，领导上都注意从侧面引导工人委员多发言，避免将既订的草案一下摆在他们面前，或作大包大揽性的发言。工人委员很快就改变了不说话的情况，工人委员王顺清、张仁奇、唐凤仪、石景荣等都成了养路计划管理方面的能手。
    为进一步加强业务领导，一九五○年开始，该段管委会委员实行了分工，建立了四个研究组，每半月轮流检查一个工作部门，包括检查工作完成的程度，研究其存在的缺点，并指出积极改进的办法，现已收到初步成绩。如材料股料账过去每月报不出，账面与现品不符，经管委会检查帮助后，解决了干部思想上的保守观念，实行了明确分工，加强仓库管理工作，现材料保管得井井有条，过去两个月算不出的账，半个月便能完成了。（丰台工务段通讯组姚克）
