Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: The Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government has issued instructions on afforestation during the rainy season, calling on provinces in North and Northwest China, as well as parts of East and Northeast China, to carry out tree planting and afforestation during the summer rainy season.

The instructions pointed out that tree planting and afforestation have always been carried out in the spring, but most of the provinces in North and Northwest China, as well as parts of East and Northeast China, are often plagued by severe droughts in the spring. Generally, it is difficult for trees to survive when planting in high, dry mountainous areas and sandy lands in the spring. More than 60 percent of the annual rainfall in these areas is concentrated in July and August. If tree planting and afforestation are carried out during the rainy season, the survival rate will be much higher than in the spring. In order to strive for more time for afforestation each year, provinces in North and Northwest China, as well as parts of East and Northeast China, should seize the rainy season as one of the important seasons for afforestation. To this end, the instructions require the above-mentioned areas to grasp the period from early to mid-July to early August, utilizing the time after rains and between farming activities to mobilize afforestation without hindering summer hoeing.

The instructions require all localities to make preparations before late June. For collective cooperative afforestation, it is necessary to fully deliberate and clearly stipulate the methods of shareholding, profit sharing, and protection. In order to eliminate the concerns of the masses and ensure the completion of the afforestation tasks during the rainy season, all localities should strengthen organizational leadership and master the various technical principles well, so that administrative leadership and technical guidance are closely integrated.

Regarding the technical principles to be mastered, the instructions pointed out that for sowing and raising seedlings in the rainy season, seeds with thin skins and easy germination should be selected. For planting trees, cuttings, and layering, it is advisable to use seedlings and young branches from the current year or the previous year. Different tree species should be selected according to different afforestation sites. For example, sandy wastelands can be planted with poplars, willows, jujubes, and pears, while mountainous areas can be planted with Chinese toon, maple, pine, cypress, etc. Each forest area can specify the main tree species and auxiliary tree species. While advocating the sowing of oak and Quercus mongolica seeds in mountainous areas, the instructions pointed out that oak and Quercus mongolica are excellent timber species and are extremely easy to survive when sown in soil-covered mountainous areas, making them the main tree species for afforestation in North and Northwest China.

Regarding the rainy season afforestation work in the areas along the rivers, the instructions emphasized that it must be combined with the river management departments and coordinated with the river management work to effectively establish flood prevention and bank protection forests. When afforestation, women and children should be mobilized to participate as much as possible so as not to delay flood prevention and rescue.

The instructions finally called on all localities to continue to implement the forest protection policy. In the preparation work for afforestation during the rainy season, they should also check the results and survival conditions of afforestation in the spring, further identify problems, summarize experiences, and commend afforestation models and activists to facilitate the development of afforestation movements during the rainy season.

　　林垦部指示华北西北等地
    抓紧雨季植树造林
    【新华社二十五日讯】中央人民政府林垦部发出雨季造林指示，号召华北和西北各省，以及华东、东北的部分地区在夏季多雨季节进行植树造林。
    指示指出：植树造林向来是在春季，但华北与西北各省及华东与东北的部分地区，春季多半苦旱，一般高燥山地和沙地，春季造林不易成活。这些地区的全年降雨量，百分之六十以上集中在七、八两月；如果在雨季植树造林，成活率远较春季为高。为争取每年以更多的时间进行造林，华北与西北各省，和华东与东北的部分地区，应该抓紧雨季作为造林的重要季节之一。为此，指示要求上述地区须掌握头伏二伏期间（阳历七月中旬至八月上旬）利用雨后农隙，发动造林而不妨碍夏锄。
    指示要求各地在六月下旬以前作好准备工作，对于集体合作造林，更须充分酝酿，明确规定入股分红及保护办法等。为了消除群众的顾虑，保证雨季造林任务的完成，各地应加强组织领导，并很好地掌握技术上各项原则，使行政领导与技术指导密切结合。
    至于技术上应掌握的几点原则，指示指出：雨季播种育秧需选皮薄易发芽的种子；植树、插条、压条，则以采用当年或前一年生的树苗和嫩条为宜。应根据不同的造林地选择不同的树种，如沙荒可种植杨柳、枣、梨，山地可种植椿、枫、松、柏等。每一林区可规定主要树种和辅助树种。该指示在提倡在山地播种橡树和栎树时，指出：橡、栎两树种木材优良，且在有土的山地播种极易成活，是华北、西北造林的主要树种。
    关于沿河地区的雨季造林工作，指示强调必须结合治河部门，与治河工作配合，有效地建立防洪护滩林。造林时应尽量发动妇女儿童参加，使不耽误防汛和抢险。
    指示最后号召各地继续贯彻护林政策，在雨季造林的准备工作中，应同时检查春季造林成绩与成活情形，进一步发现问题，总结经验，表扬造林的模范和积极分子，以利于雨季造林运动之开展。
