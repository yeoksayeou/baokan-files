Strengthening the Ties Between State-Owned Economy and Cooperatives
Chahar Province Widely Establishes Contract Systems
Small Producers' Operations Trend Towards Organization and Planning

[Zhangjiakou News] According to the Chahar Daily News on May 7th: In order to further strengthen the close ties between state-owned companies and cooperatives, and to guide the scattered individual economy towards an organized and planned path, Chahar Province is widely establishing contract systems. Since the provincial cooperative trade conference in March focused on discussing the new business methods of widely signing business contracts, by April 25th, all 30 county cooperatives and three city cooperatives in the province had signed various business contracts with companies and small producers. The Native Produce Company signed contracts to collect more than 500,000 jin of medicinal herbs and more than 20,000 jin of sulfur with disaster areas such as Chicheng, Longguan, Yanqing, and Chongli. It also signed contracts with Yuxian to collect white ramie on its behalf. From January to April 25th, the Native Produce Company had already purchased 600,520 jin of white ramie in Yuxian through cooperatives. The Oil and Fat Company signed consignment and agency purchase contracts with 11 cooperatives in Zhangbei, Wanquan, and other places, thereby doubling the collection and sales work in March compared to February. In order to support sideline production and ensure exports, the Egg Products Company signed agency purchase contracts with cooperatives in Yanbei Special District, Tianzhen, Yanggao, Pinglu, Zuoyun, Youyu, and other places. The company penetrated into remote rural areas through cooperatives. From March 23rd to April 27th, the company purchased a total of more than 5.11 million eggs, of which 60 percent were purchased through cooperatives. The Coal and Iron Company also signed consignment contracts with cooperatives in Yanggao, Wanquan, and other places along the Ping-Sui Railway. In addition, according to statistics from the Provincial Federation of Cooperatives, from mid-March to the end of April, cooperatives in various places and small producers had signed 71 business contracts for agency purchase, consignment, ordering, customization, and exchange. The quantities confirmed include 19,333 pieces of iron farm tools, 11,758 pieces of wooden farm tools, 75,000 pieces of wood, and 2,000 jin of asphalt. Zhuolu and Tianzhen County Cooperatives and 15 blacksmith shops signed 16 contracts. Hunyuan and other six county cooperatives and Chicheng and other four county cooperatives, one village cooperative, and three carpenter shops signed eight contracts, ordering 8,610 pieces of handcarts, drills, grindstones, baskets, wooden handles, etc. Hunyuan County Cooperative and Dongguan Village Cooperative and four small producers including Zhou Ru signed five contracts, ordering 400,000 jin of lime. The Provincial Federation of Cooperatives' Business Office and the Zhangjiakou City Third District Woodworking Cooperative and 11 blacksmith shops signed 25 contracts. In order to support these blacksmith shops' shortcomings, the Business Office has supplied them with 17,687 jin of steel and iron at low prices, solving the problem of insufficient funds for the iron shops. Hunyuan County Cooperative and Niu Ren, Qiao Mingqing, and other 16 iron foundries signed two exchange contracts. The county cooperative exchanged 16,706 jin of pig iron for 8,000 plowshares from the iron foundries. At present, the implementation of contracts in various places is mostly very good. For example, of the more than 8,800 pieces of agricultural tools ordered by the Provincial Federation of Cooperatives' Business Office and county cooperatives and small producers, more than 7,000 pieces have been completed. According to reports from Hunyuan and other 13 county cooperatives, of the 49,762 pieces of agricultural tools they ordered from small producers, 11,338 pieces have been delivered to the masses. However, there are still shortcomings in the execution of contracts by individual units. For example, of the 1,200 pickaxe handles purchased by Chicheng County Cooperative on behalf of the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau, only 200 met the specifications stipulated in the contract. The 2,000 iron shovels that Huaian ordered from the Datong Production Cooperative were not only not delivered on time by Datong, but the finished products also did not meet the contract requirements. These problems show that some cooperatives have not paid enough attention to the spirit of the trade cooperation meeting and must be corrected in a timely manner.

　　加强国营经济与合作社的联系
　　察省广泛建立合同制 
    小生产者经营趋向组织化计划化
    【张家口讯】据五月七日察哈尔日报消息：为进一步加强国营公司与合作社间的密切联系，引导分散的个体经济走向有组织有计划的道路，察省各地广泛建立合同制。该省自三月合作贸易会议上着重讨论了广泛订立业务合同的新的经营方式后，到四月二十五日止，全省三十个县社三个市社与公司、小生产者纷纷签订各种业务合同。土产公司与赤城、龙关、延庆、崇礼等灾区订立五十余万斤收药合同，二万余斤硫磺合同，并与蔚县订立代收白麻合同，从一月份起至四月二十五日止，土产公司已在蔚县通过合作社收购白麻六十万零五千二百斤。油脂公司与张北、万全等十一个合作社订立代销、代购合同，因而使三月份的收、销工作较二月份增加了一倍。蛋品公司为扶植副业生产，保证出口，与雁北专区、天镇、阳高、平鲁、左云、右玉等地合作社订立代购合同，通过合作社深入偏僻农村，该公司从三月二十三日至四月二十七日共收购鸡蛋五百一十一万余个，其中通过合作社收购者即占百分之六十。煤铁公司也与平绥沿线的阳高、万全等地合作社订立代销合同。此外，据省总社统计，自三月中旬至四月底止，各地合作社之间及与小生产者已订立的代购、代销、订购、订制、交换等业务合同达七十一件。已确定数量者计铁农具一万九千三百三十三件，木农具一万一千七百五十八件、木料七万五千根、柏油二千斤。涿鹿、天镇县社和十五户铁匠炉订合同十六件。浑源等六个县社和赤城等四个县社、一个村社、三个木匠铺订合同八件，订购手推车、耧、地磨、筐子、木柄等八千六百一十件。浑源县社和东关村社及小生产者周儒等四个人订合同五件，订购石灰四十万斤。省社业务处和张市三区木工社及十一户铁匠炉，订合同二十五件，业务处为了扶助这些铁匠炉不足，已廉价供给其钢、铁一万七千六百八十七斤，解决了铁炉资金不足的困难。浑源县社和牛仁、乔明清等十六个铸铁炉订交换合同二件，县社以一万六千七百零六斤生铁，换铁炉犁铧八千个。目前，各地合同执行程度大部很好，如省社业务处和县社以及小生产者订购的八千八百多件农具现已完成七千多件，又据浑源等十三个县社报告，他们与小生产者订购的四万九千七百六十二件农具，现已有一万一千三百三十八件送到群众手中。但也有个别单位在执行合同中仍有缺点。比如赤城县社与张家口铁路分局代购的一千二百根镐柄，合乎合同所定规格者只二百根。怀安向大同生产社订购的二千张铁锨，大同既没按期交货，而且成品也不合合同规定。这些问题说明了有些合作社对贸易合作会议的精神尚未很好重视，须及时改正。
