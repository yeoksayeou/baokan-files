Czechoslovakia Five Years After Liberation
    Dr. Weisskopf, Czechoslovak Ambassador to China
    For the people of Czechoslovakia, the days of May are joyful, because they provide a good opportunity to summarize the events and achievements that have taken place in the relatively short period since the end of World War II and the liberation of Czechoslovakia from Nazi occupation by the victorious Red Army of the great Soviet Union. In these five years, Czechoslovakia has not only repaired all the losses suffered in the war, but has also begun large-scale new construction.
    Of course, the only thing that made this possible was the fundamental transformation of bourgeois democracy into people's democracy. The liberation of Czechoslovakia came from the East, and the Nazi occupation was caused by the shameful Munich Agreement of 1938, which was brought about by the conspiracy of those Western countries. This fact enabled her to move forward to a new political and social system immediately after being liberated from foreign oppression in 1945. However, it was only after the events of February 1948 that power was truly taken over by the people, represented by the National Front of the working class, headed by the Communist Party. After February 1948, land reform was expanded and completed, nationalization was carried out in areas that had been hindered and sabotaged, and state administration was clarified and renovated.
    As a country temporarily between capitalism and socialism, our economy still contains several parts: (1) the socialist part, including nationalized industry and cooperatives; (2) the small-scale production part, including the vast number of farmers and handicraftsmen; (3) the capitalist part, including the remaining bourgeois merchants and rich peasants. Since state-owned industry occupies 97 percent of all industrial enterprises, a solid foundation for building a socialist economy has been established.
    In our Two-Year Plan—a plan of construction—our production increased by 10 percent compared to the production level of the last years of the war. The main goal of our Five-Year Plan, now in its second year, is to change our economic structure. Before the implementation of this plan, our heavy industry accounted for 40 percent and light industry accounted for 60 percent. In the fifth year of this plan, we will reverse this ratio. The targets set for the first year have been successfully achieved, and the plan has been completed by 102.8 percent. In the first year, our machinery production exceeded the production of consumer goods by 40 percent. Although we put all our energy into increasing industrial production, we have not forgotten that what we care most about is people, not machines. We have not forgotten that the increase in production, the improvement of production, and the race toward socialism have only one purpose: to improve the material and cultural living standards of the working people. Here, we can also point out the successes: today there are no unemployed people in Czechoslovakia, beggars have disappeared, and the infant mortality rate has dropped from 109 per thousand in 1946 to 81 in 1949. In the first year of the Five-Year Plan, we reduced prices three times. In the third price reduction at the end of that year, we reduced prices as follows: clothing prices were reduced by 40 percent, leather shoe prices were reduced by 20 to 40 percent, pork prices were reduced by 20 percent, beef prices were reduced by 33 percent, sausage prices were reduced by 30 percent, and so on. The productivity of each worker increased by about 4.5 percent. The improvement of living standards can be seen from the quantity of materials consumed by the people. If we take the per capita consumption in 1948 as 100, then the milk consumption one year later was 135, egg consumption was 124, cheese consumption was 208, flour consumption was 144, woolen fabric consumption was 121, silk consumption was 257, soap consumption was 106, household electricity consumption was 120, and household electric iron consumption was 346. Compared with before the war, the state's expenditure on social undertakings has increased twofold, and education expenditure has increased threefold. Apart from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia is the only country in the world that grants all workers an average of more than three weeks of paid leave each year. Today, in Czechoslovakia, old-age pensions, including accident insurance, are six times higher than in the United States and twice as high as in New Zealand.
    The national budget for 1949, which was also the budget for the first year of the Five-Year Plan, was a national budget that achieved a considerable surplus rather than a deficit. The public debt was reduced by approximately two billion crowns (Czech currency). Each budget reflects the characteristics of the country's economic and social system and the signs of its leadership class. The 1950 budget of Czechoslovakia has the largest investment in industry and construction. 26.3 percent of the budget is allocated to social and health undertakings, 12 percent is used for cultural undertakings, and only 9 percent is used for national defense. This is a budget of peace, a budget of a prosperous people's democracy.
    These social and economic achievements have made the people of Czechoslovakia feel extremely happy when they look back on the path they have traveled in the past five years. On the other hand, major political changes have taken place in the world, giving them more reason to be overjoyed. They think of the steady development of the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries (their friends and allies); they think of the victory of the Chinese revolution, the establishment of the People's Republic of China, and the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, events that were enthusiastically celebrated by the people of Czechoslovakia; they think of the fact that today the peace camp has 800 million people and is constantly strengthening.
    Therefore, Czechoslovakia is celebrating its fifth anniversary of liberation with a truly joyful mood. We are happy members of a great country that is not subject to imperialist oppression and is building its own bright future with its own strength!

### 解放五年后的捷克斯洛伐克

　　解放五年后的捷克斯洛伐克
    捷克斯洛伐克共和国驻华大使魏斯柯普夫博士
    对于捷克斯洛伐克的人民，五月的日子是愉快的，因为它们提供了一个良好的机会，来总结一下从第二次世界大战结束与伟大的苏联的胜利的红军把捷克斯洛伐克从纳粹的占领下解放后，这段比较短短的时期内所发生的事情与成就。在这五年中，捷克斯洛伐克不仅把全部在战争中所遭受的损失都修复了，而且还开始了大规模的新建设。
    当然造成这种可能唯一的是由于资产阶级的民主改变为人民的民主这个基本的转变。捷克斯洛伐克的解放是从东方来的，而纳粹的占领是由于那些西方国家的阴谋所造成的可耻的一九三八年的慕尼黑协定所促成的，这个事实使她从外来的压迫得到解放后，立即于一九四五年即向一个新的政治与社会制度前进。但是惟独在一九四八年二月的事件后，政权才确实地由以共产党为首的劳动阶级的民族阵线为代表的人民所接收。一九四八年二月以后，土地改革是扩大了，完成了，国家化是在曾经被阻碍过和被破坏过的地区进行了；国家行政是澄清了，革新了。
    作为一个暂时介于资本主义与社会主义之间的国家，我们的经济仍是包含着几个部分：（一）社会主义部分，包括国家化的工业与合作社；（二）小规模生产部分，包括广大的农民与手工业者；（三）资本主义部分，包括残余的资产阶级的商人与富农。由于国有的工业占据了全部工业企业的百分之九十七，一个建设社会主义经济的稳固基础是建立起来了。
    在我们的两年计划——一个建设的计划——中，我们的生产量和最后战争的数年的生产水平相比是增加了百分之十。正在第二年中的我们的五年计划的主要目的，是改变我们的经济机构。在这个计划实行前，我们的重工业占了百分之四十，轻工业占了百分之六十。在这个计划的第五年，我们将把这个比例颠倒过来。第一年所订的目标已经成功地达到了，这个计划被完成了百分之一百零二点八。在第一年中，我们的机械生产超过了消费品生产的百分之四十。虽然把我们的全部精力放在增加工业生产上，但是我们并未忘记我们所最关心的是人而不是机器。我们并还未忘记生产的增加，生产的提高与向社会主义发展的竞赛仅有一个目的：提高劳动人民的物质生活与文化的水平。这里，我们还能指出成功的地方：今天捷克斯洛伐克已没有失业者，乞丐已绝迹，婴儿的死亡率已由在一九四六年中的每千人中的一○九人减为一九四九年的八十一人。在五年计划的第一年中，我们把物价减低了三倍。在那年年底第三次减低物价中，我们把物价减低如下：衣料价格减低了百分之四十，皮鞋价格减低了百分之二十至百分之四十，猪肉价格减低了百分之二十，牛肉价格减低了百分之三十三，腊肠价格减低了百分之三十等等。每个工人的生产力约提高百分之四点五。生活水准的提高可从人民消费的物资数量上看出来，如果我们把每人在一九四八年的消费作为一百，那么一年后的牛乳消耗量是一百三十五，蛋的消耗量是一百二十四，乳酪的消耗量是二百零八，面粉的消耗量是一百四十四，呢绒的消耗量是一百二十一，绸的消耗量是二百五十七，肥皂的消耗量是一百零六，家庭用电的消耗量是一百二十，家用电气熨斗的消耗量是三百四十六。与战前相比，国家用于社会事业的款项增加了两倍，教育的经费增加了三倍。除苏联而外，捷克斯洛伐克是世界上唯一赋与全部工人每年平均超过三星期仍然支薪的假期的国家。今天，在捷克斯洛伐克年老人的恤金，包括了意外事件的保险，较美国高六倍，较新西兰高两倍。
    一九四九年的国家预算，也就是五年计划的第一年的预算，是一个获得相当数目的盈余而不是亏损的国家预算。公共债务大约减了二十亿克郎（捷克币名）。每个预算表现了国家的经济与社会制度的特色和它的领导阶级的迹象。一九五○年的捷克斯洛伐克的预算对工业与建设有最大的投资。拨了预算的百分之二十六点三的经费给社会事业和卫生事业，百分之十二用于文化事业，而仅有百分之九用于国防，这是一个和平的预算，一个富裕的人民民主的预算。
    这些社会方面和经济方面的成就，使捷克斯洛伐克人民在回顾五年来所经过的道路的时候，感到万分的高兴。另一方面，世界已经发生了重大的政治变化，使他们更有欢忻鼓舞的理由。他们想到苏联和各人民民主国家（他们的友邦与同盟者）的稳步的发展；他们想到中国革命的胜利，中华人民共和国的成立，与中苏友好同盟协定，这些事件曾为捷克斯洛伐克人民所热烈地庆祝过；他们想到今天的和平阵营中已拥有八亿人民，而且是在不断地增强中。
    所以捷克斯洛伐克实在是以一种欢乐的心情来庆祝她的解放五周年纪念。我们是不受帝国主义压迫的、用他们自己的力量来建设他们自己光明的前途的伟大国家中愉快的一员！
