　　Ten Public Factories and Enterprises, Including the Clothing Factory, Have Established Management Committees
　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Establishing or re-electing factory and enterprise management committees is one of the central tasks of public factories and enterprises in the capital. Most public factories and enterprises are enthusiastically studying documents or electing members of the management committee. In the past three months, ten factories and enterprises have established management committees. Before February of this year, only fourteen of the city's sixty-three public factories and enterprises had established management committees. Moreover, with the exception of a few units such as the Telecommunications Bureau, which were well prepared and integrated with production, playing a certain role, most of them were just formalities. Some units did not hold meetings for more than two months, and some became administrative advisory bodies. The main reason for this situation was that the heads of each unit did not have sufficient understanding of the importance and role of the management committee. In the past three months, due to the earnest study of the People's Daily editorial "Learn to Manage Enterprises" by the administrative staff of each factory and enterprise, there has been a further realization that establishing a management committee is a fundamental link in transforming old enterprises and managing people's enterprises well. At the same time, the Beijing Municipal People's Government's Bureau of Industry and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions have also been closely arranging this work. Therefore, since February, public factories and enterprises have begun to actively prepare for this work. Among them, ten units including the Beijing Clothing Factory, China People's Printing Factory, North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory, various factories under the Beijing Machine Factory, various factories under the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Xiaobeishan Coal Mine, 70th Ordnance Factory, New Pharmaceutical Factory, Geda Printing Factory, and Changxindian Railway Factory have successively established management committees. The New Water Plant and the Capital Power Plant have successively re-elected and enriched the original management committees. Units such as the Trolleybus Company have also matured and will be established soon.

　　被服厂等十个公营工厂企业
　  先后成立管理委员会
    【京市新闻处讯】建立或改选工厂、企业管理委员会，是当前首都公营工厂、企业的中心工作之一，大部分公营工厂企业正在热烈进行学习文件或选举管委会委员。近三个月来，已有十个工厂、企业建立了管委会。今年二月以前，本市六十三个公营工厂企业中，建立了管理委员会的只有十四个，并且除电信局等少数单位，因准备较好，结合了生产，起了一定的作用以外，大部分都流于形式，有的单位两个多月不开会，有的变成了行政上的顾问机构。造成这种情况的原因，主要的是各单位的负责人，对管委会的重要性和作用，认识不够。近三个月来由于各工厂企业行政人员，切实学习了人民日报《学会管理企业》的社论，进一步认识到建立管委会是改造旧企业，管好人民企业的基本环节。同时，北京市人民政府工业局、市总工会也都抓紧布置这项工作，所以从二月起，各公营工厂企业，都开始积极进行准备工作，其中北京被服厂、中国人民印刷厂、华北农业机械总厂、北京机器厂所属各厂、石景山钢铁厂所属各厂、小黑山煤矿、七十兵工厂、新建制药厂、革大印刷厂、长辛店铁路大厂等十单位，已先后建立了管委会。新建制水厂、首都发电厂等已先后改选，并充实了原有的管委会。电车公司等单位也已酝酿成熟，最近即可建立。
