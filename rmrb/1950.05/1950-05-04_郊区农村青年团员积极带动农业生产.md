　　Suburban Rural Youth League Members Actively Promote Agricultural Production
    [Our Newspaper] Over four thousand six hundred Youth League members developed in the land reform in the suburbs of Beijing are currently playing an exemplary and leading role in production. Youth League members in ten villages including Baipenyao and Mading in Fengtai District have organized mutual aid teams in conjunction with the masses. Yang Yongshan and Chen Chunrong, Youth League members in Yimuyuan in the western suburbs, each received seven mu of paddy fields. The two helped each other and completed the work of smoothing ridges on fourteen mu of land in four days; after finishing, they worked for other families. Youth League members in Heita Village formed mutual aid teams with the masses, helping each other, encouraging and supervising each other, which further improved the farmers' production enthusiasm. In land reclamation and ditch digging, Youth League members also played a key role. Youth League members in Wenquan in the western suburbs led more than a dozen young people to reclaim more than ten mu of land. Forty-six Youth League members in Liulangzhuang led the masses in digging ditches, which was completed in two days, ensuring that 650 mu of rice and paddy fields were free from flooding. In terms of tree planting and developing sideline production, in Taiziyu Village, Changxindian, female League members were at the core, and twenty-one people organized six groups to plant 371 trees. Youth League members in Liulangzhuang in the western suburbs organized the masses to plant 365 trees. Zhang Fu, a Youth League member in Nanzhuangzi, Fengtai District, raised two pigs this year, Zhang Shuzhen has bought six chickens, and female League members have also led women to spread bean seedlings and bundle spinach for others. Because Youth League members can actively participate in production, they have won unanimous praise from farmers. An old woman in the western suburbs said, "You League members are really good! Since the Communist Party came, the years have changed greatly." An old farmer in Fanjiacun, seeing Youth League members so actively involved in production, hoped that his children could also strive to join the League as soon as possible.
