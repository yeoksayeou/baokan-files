　　I believe that nurses serve patients by doing two main things: first, using their hands, and second, using their mouths. By "using their hands," I mean serving patients through various nursing techniques, such as administering medication, enemas, injections, physiotherapy, and so on. To do these things well requires not only skilled techniques but also patient and enthusiastic care. By "using their mouths," I mean conducting propaganda for patients.
    Nurses' propaganda for patients includes two aspects: first, promoting the medical system, and second, promoting disease knowledge. We should acknowledge that, historically, these two aspects of propaganda have been advocated and, to some extent, practiced ever since nursing work began. However, under the new work style and new work attitude, we should have new perspectives on how to promote these two aspects.
    First, regarding the medical system. The establishment of the medical system is to ensure the safety of hospitalized patients and accelerate their recovery. The system includes issues of staffing, work responsibilities, and work order. Since it is a work system, it is naturally closely related to the entire social system. However, today, we do not yet have a complete medical system of our own. On the one hand, we must sort out and critique the existing medical systems of the past. On the other hand, we must study and appropriately absorb the medical system of the advanced country—the Soviet Union—to create a medical system that is suitable for today's Chinese social system and economic conditions. Therefore, from this perspective, our nursing workers have the primary responsibility to study how to improve our work system, and then further promote our system to patients, persuading them to abide by our system.
    Here, we must also understand that not every patient can fully comply with the medical system. This is inevitable and not surprising because patients are neither doctors nor nurses. Precisely because of this, propaganda for the medical system is necessary. To do this propaganda work well, we need not only knowledge of techniques and knowledge of the system itself but also knowledge of society, a position of serving the people, and the same enthusiasm for patients as for brothers and sisters.
    Therefore, only nursing workers who are not only good at learning techniques but also good at learning politics can do a good job of propaganda for patients.
    Second, regarding disease knowledge. Promoting disease knowledge is also the nurse's own business. However, the disease knowledge mentioned here is not just the things patients should pay attention to during illness, not just the knowledge of disease care and treatment, but more importantly, the knowledge of disease prevention. Because what we hope for patients is not only that they recover from their current illness but also that they no longer get sick. Therefore, every nursing worker must be a health propagandist and must be familiar with prevention knowledge.
    Conducting disease knowledge propaganda for patients is also not a simple matter. We must first understand the patient's emotions. The purpose of our propaganda is to stabilize the patient's emotions, make them feel at ease, prevent them from panicking, boost their confidence, and make them feel happy. In addition, we must also understand the patient's living habits and knowledge level. Our propaganda work is also the work of popularizing scientific knowledge.
    Clearly, to do a good job of promoting disease knowledge, it is not enough to just study textbooks. We must constantly study how to transform relatively complex scientific knowledge into easy-to-understand common sense, and it is also very necessary to pay attention to reading popular science books and newspapers, drawing content and methods from them.
    Therefore, only nursing workers who are not only good at learning treatment medicine but also good at learning preventive medicine, not only good at studying techniques but also good at explaining techniques with popular principles, can do a good job of propaganda for hospitalized patients.
    At the same time, future nursing work should not only take place in hospitals, taking good care of the wounded and sick, but also go out to the vast people, taking on the propaganda work of health care, so familiarizing oneself with the art of propaganda has become an important task.

### 护士的宣传工作

　　护士的宣传工作
　　黄树则
    我认为，护士为病人服务，主要做两件事情：第一件事情是用手，第二件事情是用口。所谓用手，就是用护病技术的各种操作来服务于病人，譬如像给药，浣肠，注射，理疗等等；要把这些做好，不仅仅需要有熟练的技术，而且需要有耐烦的热诚的心情。所谓用口，就是向病人做宣传。
    护士向病人做宣传，包括两个内容：第一是宣传医疗制度，第二是宣传疾病知识。我们应该承认，这两项宣传内容，从护病历史上看可以说自有护士工作以来，就在提倡做，而且有些是已经做过的。但是，在新的工作作风新的工作态度之下，对于如何来宣传这两项内容，我们应该有新的看法。
    第一、关于医疗制度。医疗制度的建立是为了保障住院病人的安全，加速病人的治愈。制度包括编制问题，工作职责问题，工作秩序问题；既然是工作制度，当然就与整个社会制度有着密切的关系。但是在今天，我们还没有一套完整的自己的医疗制度。一方面，对于过去已有的医疗制度，我们必须加以整理、批判，另一方面，对于先进国家——苏联——的医疗制度，我们必须加以研究，适当的吸收；从而产生一套适合于今天我们中国社会制度经济情况的医疗制度。因此，从这一问题看来，我们的护士工作者，就首先有责任来研究如何改进我们的工作制度，然后进一步向病人宣传我们的制度，说服病人遵守我们的制度。
    在这里我们还必须知道，不是每一个病人都能以完全地遵守医疗制度的。这是难免的，不奇怪的，因为病人不是医生，也不是护士。也正因为如此，所以对于医疗制度，必须进行宣传。而要把这一宣传工作做好，同样不仅需要对于技术的知识，对于制度本身的知识；而且需要具有对于社会的知识，具有为人民服务的立场，具有对病人如兄弟姊妹般的热情。
    因此，唯有不仅善于学习技术而且善于学习政治的护病工作者，才能做好对病人的宣传工作。
    第二、关于疾病知识。宣传疾病知识同样是护士本身的业务。但是，这里所说的疾病知识不仅仅是病人在病中应该注意的事项，不仅仅是对于疾病的护理和治疗的知识，而且更重要的是疾病的预防知识。因为我们所希望于病人的，不仅是他养好现在的病，而且希望他不再得病。所以，我们每一护病工作者，都必须是卫生宣传者，都必须熟悉预防知识。
    向病人进行疾病知识宣传，也并不是很轻而易举的事情。我们必须首先懂得病人的情绪，我们的宣传目的是为了稳定病人的情绪，使他安心，使他不恐慌，助长他的信心，使他的精神愉快。另外，我们还必须懂得病人的生活习惯，知识水平，我们的宣传工作，也就是把科学知识加以通俗化的工作。
    很显然地，为要把疾病知识的宣传做好，仅仅满足于学习教科书还是不够的。我们必须随时研究怎样把比较艰深的科学知识化为容易懂的常识，关心浏览通俗的科学书报，从那里面吸取内容，吸取方法，同样很必要。
    因此，唯有不仅善于学习治疗医学而且善于学习预防医学，不仅善于钻研技术，而且善于将技术用通俗的道理来说明的护病工作者，才能做好对住院病人的宣传工作。
    同时今后的护士工作，不仅要在医院中，把伤病员护理好，而且要走向广大的人民中间去，负起保健卫生的宣传工作，因此熟习宣传的艺术，成为重要的课题了。
