International Week

An Unprecedented Demonstration of Peace Forces

The May Day of 1950 was a day for the working people of the world to hold a general demonstration of unprecedented revolutionary unity against the instigators of imperialist war.

The working people of the world unanimously and enthusiastically responded to the May Day appeal of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks): "Expose the evil plans of the warmongers! Expand and consolidate the powerful front of peace supporters! Defending peace is the cause of all people in the world!"

Millions of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals in the Soviet Union participated in the socialist competition celebrating May Day. With their great creative labor, they further strengthened the power of the Soviet state, realized the plan to build a communist society, and pointed out the road to freedom and happiness for mankind. This has greatly inspired the struggle for people's democracy and lasting peace around the world. The grand military parade and the demonstration of over one million people in Red Square in Moscow once again demonstrated the invincible power of the Soviet armed forces and the firm confidence of the Soviet people in defending peace.

People's democratic countries marching towards the road of building socialism commemorated May Day with new achievements in production by fulfilling their "May Day pledges". Their slogan was: "Every labor victory is a victory in the struggle against the warmongers." Hundreds of thousands of working people participated in demonstration parades in the capitals of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria and other countries. They held high the same banner: "Defend Peace! Oppose imperialism and warmongers! Express infinite love for the Soviet Union!"

Imperialists are trying to turn occupied West Germany and Japan into major military bases for new wars of aggression, making the German and Japanese people the main suppliers of cannon fodder. However, on this year's May Day, Berlin held a large demonstration of one million working people, and Tokyo held a large demonstration of six hundred thousand working people, to answer the agents of the warmonger group - McCloy and MacArthur. The German Democratic Republic and other cities in West Germany held similar demonstrations, showing that the German people are determined to fight for peace and German unity. The Japanese working people put forward clear slogans: "Strive for peace and independence! Strive for the conclusion of a comprehensive peace treaty! Oppose any foreign country maintaining military bases in Japan!"

Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the working people in capitalist countries warned the reactionary ruling groups of all countries in the same language: No war is allowed! Paris held a huge demonstration parade for more than five hours with the participation of forty-four democratic groups. Large-scale rallies and demonstrations were held throughout Italy, with a total of 10 million people participating. 75,000 working people in New York held high the banner of demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons and urging intensified efforts for peace, and participated in the demonstration parade. Rallies were also held in the Netherlands, Austria, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Canada under the resounding slogan of defending peace.

In Asia, the Chinese working people celebrated their festival freely under the protection of their own government for the first time, with special excitement and pride, celebrating the festival of international solidarity of the working people. The Chinese people resolutely stated that they will join the working people of the world in supporting the international peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and fight for lasting peace and people's democracy! Fight against imperialist aggression and the instigators of new wars! Pyongyang, the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, held a large demonstration with the participation of 350,000 people, calling for the struggle for the unification and independence of Korea and the defense of world peace. The Vietnamese people responded to the May Day call of the Viet Lien and Viet Minh by thoroughly implementing the order of general mobilization, increasing production, and supporting world peace with more resolute combat actions against US and French imperialism. The working people of colonial and semi-colonial countries, although subjected to prohibition and oppression by foreign and local reactionaries, still bravely and enthusiastically held grand rallies, demonstrating their determination to fight for peace, democracy and genuine national independence. More than 500,000 people's rallies were organized in the worker districts of Bombay. The mass rally in Manila warned US imperialism: Do not interfere in the affairs of the Philippines!

While the working people of the world held unprecedentedly enthusiastic May Day demonstrations under the slogan of defending peace and opposing war, the movement to sign the petition of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress demanding the prohibition of atomic weapons was also widely launched in every country of the world. Millions of people actively participated. The May Day of 1950, as called for in the May Day declaration of the World Federation of Trade Unions, has truly become a worldwide festival in which the working people of all countries actively express their desire to establish a solid and lasting peace throughout the world.

The Imperialist Bloc Continues to Paralyze the United Nations

Since the closing of the Fourth General Assembly last December, the United Nations organization has been in a state of paralysis because the imperialist bloc headed by the United States has unreasonably prevented the legal representatives of the People's Republic of China from attending. The American aggressors and their servant countries in Lake Success are still stubbornly clinging to the political corpse of a small group of bandits in Taiwan.

The activities of US imperialism in undermining the United Nations and preparing for new wars have recently been particularly evident in the active deployment of the expanded North Atlantic war group. For a long time, the US aggressors have planned to use the "North Atlantic Treaty" as the backbone, the "Marshall Plan" as the arteries, and the "European Committee" as the skin, to create a barbaric robot as a tool to promote war policies. The so-called "North Atlantic Overall Defense Strategic Concept", "European Economic Integration", "Franco-German Alliance", etc., all proceed from this point of view. Before the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the United States, Britain, and France in London, Wall Street ordered one of its most loyal lackeys, French Prime Minister Bidault, to propose the establishment of the so-called "Atlantic Peace Supreme Council" on April 16. This "Supreme Council" will include various existing aggressive and enslaving organizations, making the Atlantic countries a "single whole" in military, economic, and political aspects, with the United States directly directing everything. French Foreign Minister Schuman further supplemented Bidault's proposal on April 26, openly advocating the establishment of a "small United Nations" including twenty countries in Europe and North America (the United States and Canada) in order to confront the United Nations organization with the veto power of the five major countries.

At the same time, the American warmonger Hoover issued a clamor to reorganize or even abolish the United Nations and "organize a new united front." Dulles also clamored that "the provisions of the United Nations Charter and membership are outdated" and need to be "re-examined." The US representative to the United Nations, Gross, publicly stated in a speech at the University of Virginia on March 17 that the Security Council should end its work and the United Nations should turn its attention to the work of secondary agencies.

It is very obvious that the imperialist bloc is arrogantly attempting to further paralyze the work of the United Nations, especially the Security Council. However, the imperialist bloc's unscrupulous sabotage of the United Nations Charter will inevitably be met with the growing opposition of peace-loving people around the world.

Economic Development of the Soviet Union and People's Democratic Countries

Recently, the Soviet Union and several people's democratic countries announced reports on the production summary of the first quarter of 1950, and several people's democratic countries also issued decisions on abolishing rationing and reducing prices.

The total industrial output of the Soviet Union in the first quarter of this year increased by 22 percent compared with the first quarter of last year. The total industry of Romania in the first three months exceeded the production plan by 4.6 percent. Bulgaria completed 101.6 percent of the first quarter's total industrial output plan, an increase of 21.7 percent compared with the same period in 1949. The production of Czech industrial workers in March exceeded the plan by 5.2 percent. Poland and North Korea also overfulfilled their production plans. As everyone knows, the total industrial output of all these countries has exceeded or greatly exceeded the pre-war level last year. Taking the Soviet Union as an example, it exceeded the 1940 level by 41 percent last year. Therefore, the publication of these figures is of great significance.

Because Bulgaria has sufficient grain reserves, it allowed free sale of bread before May Day, and at the same time, the prices of certain major foods were reduced by 35 percent. Because agricultural production in Hungary has reached the pre-war level, the rationing of high-quality flour was abolished nationwide on April 1, and free trading was implemented (bread rationing was abolished in early September last year). Poland abolished all restrictions on retail trade on April 10, and implemented a system of free sale of all goods in state-owned stores and cooperative stores. The government of the German Democratic Republic announced the fourth price reduction since November 1948 on March 25, averaging about 30 percent. The Mongolian People's Republic abolished the rationing system for food and manufactured goods nationwide from May 1.

These examples powerfully illustrate that in the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries, industrial and agricultural production is moving towards further development, the national economy is moving towards further prosperity, and the people's living standards are moving towards further improvement. This is in stark contrast to the situation in capitalist countries. Taking the United States as an example, according to the economic report for the first quarter of this year submitted to Congress by Truman's Economic Advisory Committee, industrial investment in the United States "will decrease by 8 percent in the first half of this year compared with 1949", farmers' income will "decrease by 10 percent" compared with a year ago, and steel production in March "will decrease by nearly one million tons compared with March 1949". All kinds of official US reports cannot cover up the trend of continued economic decline in the United States.

The US "East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere"

US aggressors stationed in the Far East held a "Far East Economic Conference" in Tokyo from April 17 to 22 to discuss how to implement the US economic aggression plan against Asia in the new situation where People's China has emerged. This was another important conference following the "Bangkok Conference".

According to reports from various bourgeois news agencies, the US plan is based on the "East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere" that Japanese fascists attempted to realize ten years ago but ultimately failed, using US capital to make Japan the "factory of Asia" and monopolize Asian resources and markets. The Japanese government and US officials in Tokyo do not deny that the purpose of the Tokyo Conference is to "connect Japan's industrial potential with the raw materials of Southeast Asia". The Japanese Economic Stabilization Board, with the support of MacArthur Headquarters, also submitted six suggestions on the "Asian Marshall Plan" to the Tokyo Conference, requesting that the various US plans for economic aggression against Asia be merged into a "general plan" to "unite Asia into a group", with Japan as the center of this "general plan".

When the US aggressors put forward this arrogant plan, they obviously attempted to cut off the trade relations between Southeast Asia and the New China and impose an economic blockade on the New China. Therefore, this conference discussed "to what extent can non-communist Asia achieve without the market and raw materials of China" and "preventing the Communists from obtaining Far Eastern trade and raw materials". At the same time, the US aggressors also attempted to attack the monetary and foreign exchange controls of Asian countries, especially the pound sterling bloc, in order to completely control the trade between Asian countries. Therefore, this conference discussed the establishment of a "US-funded revolving fund or US dollar reserve fund", that is, using the US dollar as an Asian currency clearing fund.

This arrogant plan has no possibility of being realized. Because the Asian people have fresh memories of the "East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere", they resolutely oppose any form of "co-prosperity sphere" under imperialist monopoly. The position and influence of China in Asian economic life cannot be changed by the subjective wishes and conspiracies of the US aggressors. Again, in the face of the widespread upsurge of the colonial and semi-colonial people's liberation movement in Asia, any hope of "replacing China with Southeast Asia" is just a pipe dream. The US attack on the pound sterling bloc cannot but cause deepening contradictions between imperialists. These difficulties forced the US aggressors to admit: "There are many complex problems that have not been resolved." The US imperialist "East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere" is destined to go bankrupt.

    和平力量的空前大示威
    一九五○年的五一节，是全世界劳动人民以空前的革命大团结，向帝国主义战争挑拨者举行总示威的日子。
    全世界劳动人民一致热烈地响应联共中央的五一号召：“揭露战争贩子的罪恶计划！扩大与巩固强大的拥护和平阵线！保卫和平是全世界一切人民的事业！”
    苏联千百万工人、集体农民和知识分子，参加了庆祝五一节的社会主义竞赛。他们以伟大的创造性劳动，进一步加强苏维埃国家的威力，实现建设共产主义社会的计划，给人类指出了通往自由与幸福的大道。这对于全世界争取人民民主与持久和平的斗争，具有极大的鼓舞作用。在莫斯科红场举行的盛大阅兵和一百万人以上的示威游行，又一次显示出苏联武装部队无敌的威力，与苏联人民保卫和平的坚决信心。
    迈向建设社会主义道路的人民民主国家，以完成“五一保证”的生产新成就来纪念五一节。他们的口号是：“每一个劳动胜利，就是对战争贩子斗争的胜利”。捷克、匈牙利、保加利亚等国的首都，均有几十万劳动人民参加了示威游行的队伍。他们高举着同样的旗帜：“保卫和平！反对帝国主义和战争贩子！对苏联表示无限热爱！”
    帝国主义者力图把占领下的西德和日本变成新侵略战争的主要军事基地，使德国和日本人民成为主要的炮灰供给者。但是，在今年的五一节，柏林举行了一百万劳动人民的大示威，东京举行了六十万劳动人民的大示威，来答复战争贩子集团的代理人——麦克洛埃和麦克阿瑟。德意志民主共和国和西德的其他城市，举行了同样的示威，表明德国人民坚决为和平与德国的统一而斗争。日本劳动人民提出了鲜明的口号：“争取和平与独立！争取缔结全面和约！反对任何外国在日本保持军事基地！”
    资本主义国家内的劳动人民，在共产党的领导之下，都以同一语言警告各国的反动统治集团：不许发动战争！巴黎举行了五小时以上的、有四十四个民主团体参加的巨大示威游行。意大利全国各地举行盛大集会和示威游行，参加的群众共达一千万人。纽约七万五千劳动人民高擎着要求禁用原子武器、敦促加紧为和平而斗争的旗帜，参加了示威游行。在荷兰、奥地利、挪威、丹麦、芬兰、瑞士、英国、加拿大各地，也都在保卫和平的响亮口号下，举行了集会。
    在亚洲，中国劳动人民以特别兴奋和骄傲的心情，第一次在自己政府的保护之下，自由地庆祝自己的节日，庆祝劳动人民国际团结的节日。中国人民坚决地表示：他们将与全世界劳动人民一道，拥护以苏联为首的国际和平民主阵营，为持久和平与人民民主而斗争！为反对帝国主义侵略和新战争的挑拨者而斗争！朝鲜民主主义人民共和国首都平壤举行了三十五万人参加的大示威，号召为朝鲜的统一、独立与保卫世界和平而斗争。越南人民响应越联和越盟的五一号召，以彻底执行总动员的命令，增加生产，并以对美、法帝国主义更坚决的作战行动，来拥护世界和平。殖民地和半殖民地国家的劳动人民，虽然遭受外国和当地反动派的禁止压迫，仍勇敢地、热烈地举行盛大集会，表明他们为和平、民主与真正的民族独立而斗争的决心。孟买各工人区组织了五十万人以上的集会。马尼拉的群众大会警告美帝国主义：不要干涉菲律宾的事情！
    与全世界劳动人民在保卫和平反对战争的口号下举行空前热烈的五一节示威游行同时，在和大常委会要求禁止原子武器的呼吁书上签名的运动，也在全世界每一个国家广泛展开。千百万广大人民踊跃参加。一九五○年的五一节，这正如世界工会联合会的五一宣言中所号召的一样，已真正变成了各国劳动人民积极表示要在全世界建立巩固而持久的和平的世界性节日。
    帝国主义集团继续瘫痪联合国
    联合国组织自从去年十二月下旬第四届大会闭幕以来，由于以美国为首的帝国主义集团横蛮无理地阻止中华人民共和国合法代表的出席，就一直陷于瘫痪的状态中。美国侵略分子及其仆从国家在成功湖的代表们，迄今依然死抱着台湾一小撮流寇的政治僵尸。
    美帝国主义破坏联合国和准备新战争的活动，最近特别明显地表现在扩大北大西洋战争集团的积极布置上。很久以来，美国侵略分子就策划以“北大西洋公约”为骨干，以“马歇尔计划”为脉胳，以“欧洲委员会”为皮毛，造成一个野蛮的机器人，作为推行战争政策的工具。所谓“北大西洋整体防御战略概念”、“欧洲经济整体化”、“法德联盟”等等，都是从这一个观点出发的。在伦敦美、英、法三国外长会议召开之前，华尔街命令他们最忠实的走狗之一，法国总理皮杜尔于四月十六日提出了成立所谓“大西洋和平最高会议”的建议。这个“最高会议”将包括现有的各种侵略性、奴役性的组织，使大西洋国家在军事、经济、政治三方面，成为“单一的整体”，而由美国直接指挥一切。法外长舒曼更于四月二十六日进一步补充了皮杜尔的建议，公然主张建立一个包括欧洲及北美（美国及加拿大）二十个国家在内的“小型联合国”，以期与五大国家有否决权的联合国组织相对抗。
    与此同时，美国战争贩子胡佛发出了改组甚至废除联合国另行“组织新联合阵线”的叫嚣。杜勒斯也扬言“联合国宪章及会员资格的规定都已不合时宜”，而有“重新检查”的必要。美国驻联合国的代表葛罗斯，则于三月十七日在弗吉尼亚大学演说时就公然表示：安理会应结束它的工作，联合国应把它的注意力转到次要机构的工作方面。
    十分明显，帝国主义集团正狂妄地企图进一步瘫痪联合国，特别是安理会的工作。但是，帝国主义集团肆无忌惮地破坏联合国宪章的罪恶勾当，必然将遭到全世界爱好和平人民的日益增长的反对。
    苏联和人民民主国家的经济发展
    最近苏联和若干人民民主国家公布了一九五○年第一季生产总结的报告，若干人民民主国家还发表了关于取消配给和减低物价的决定。
    苏联今年第一季的全部工业总产量，较去年第一季增加了百分之二十二。罗马尼亚头三个月的全部工业，超过生产计划的百分之四·六。保加利亚第一季工业总产量计划，完成了百分之一○一·六，比一九四九年同期增加了百分之二一·七。捷克产业工人三月份的生产超过了计划的百分之五·二。波兰和朝鲜也超额完成生产计划。大家知道，所有这些国家的工业总产量，去年都已超过或大大地超过战前的水平。以苏联为例，去年就超过了一九四○年水平的百分之四十一。因此这些数字的公布，具有十分重大的意义。
    保加利亚因为国家已握有充分的粮食存储，于五一节前准许面包自由售卖，同时某些主要食品的价格减低百分之三十五。匈牙利因农业生产已达战前水平，于四月一日起，在全国取消上等面粉的配给，实行自由买卖（面包配给已于去年九月初取消）。波兰于四月十日起取消零售贸易的一切限制，在国营商店与合作社商店中，实行自由出售一切货物的制度。民主德国政府于三月二十五日宣布自一九四八年十一月以来的第四次减低物价，平均约为百分之三十。蒙古人民共和国自五月一日起，在全国范围内取消粮食和制成品的配给制。
    这些事例有力地说明：在苏联和人民民主国家内，工农业生产走向进一步的发展，国民经济走向进一步的繁荣，人民生活水平走向进一步的提高。这和资本主义国家的情形恰成鲜明的对照。以美国为例，据杜鲁门经济顾问委员会向国会提出的本年第一季经济报告透露，美国工业上的投资，“本年上半年将较一九四九年下降百分之八”，农民收入较一年以前“下降百分之十”，三月份钢铁的生产“比一九四九年三月份减少将近一百万吨”。所有美国官方的各种报告，都不能掩盖美国经济继续衰落的趋势。
    美国的“东亚共荣圈”
    驻远东各地的美国侵略分子，曾于四月十七日至二十二日在东京举行“远东经济会议”，讨论在出现了人民中国的新形势下，如何实施美国对亚洲的经济侵略计划。这是继“曼谷会议”之后的又一次重要会议。
    据各国资产阶级通讯社的报道所透露，美国的计划是以十年前日本法西斯企图实现而终告惨败的“东亚共荣圈”为蓝本，用美国资本使日本成为“亚洲的工厂”，垄断亚洲的资源和市场。日本政府及在东京的美国官方人士都不讳言东京会议的目的，是要“使日本的工业潜力和东南亚的原料衔接起来”。日本经济安定本部并在获得麦克阿瑟总部的支持下，向东京会议提出了关于“亚洲马歇尔计划”的六点建议，要求把美国对亚洲实行经济侵略的各项计划，合并为一个“总计划”将亚洲“统一为一个集团”，而以日本作为这个“总计划”的重心。
    美国侵略分子提出这个狂妄计划时，显然企图遮断东南亚与新中国的贸易关系，并对新中国施行经济封锁。因此这次会议讨论了“非共产党的亚洲如果没有中国的市场和原料能作到什么程度”以及“防止共产党取得远东贸易及原料”的问题。同时，美国侵略分子也企图对亚洲各国的货币和外汇管制进攻，特别是对英镑集团进攻，以便完全控制亚洲各国间的贸易。因此这次会议讨论了设立“美国资助的周转金或美元储备金”，即以美元作为亚洲货币清算基金的问题。
    这个狂妄计划是没有实现的可能的。因为亚洲人民对于“东亚共荣圈”的记忆犹新，他们坚决反对在帝国主义垄断下的任何形式的“共荣圈”。中国在亚洲经济生活中所占的地位及其影响，决非美国侵略分子的主观愿望和阴谋诡计所能改变。再次，在亚洲殖民地半殖民地人民解放运动普遍高涨的情况下，任何“以东南亚代替中国”的希望，不过是白日做梦。美国对英镑集团的进攻，不可能不引起帝国主义之间的日益加深的矛盾。这些困难使得美国侵略分子不得不承认：“有许多复杂的问题没有解决。”美帝国主义的“东亚共荣圈”是注定要破产的。
