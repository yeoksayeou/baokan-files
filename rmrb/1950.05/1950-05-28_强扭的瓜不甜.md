A Forced Melon is Not Sweet
	Gu Yu

Editor's Note: This article describes how the feudal marriage system still lingered in the old liberated areas' countryside after land reform, but the new forces among the people have grown, and it finally defeated this unreasonable system. The story takes place before the promulgation of the Marriage Law, but due to the correct leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and the increased awareness of the peasant masses, the arranged and forced marriages that often became tragedies in the old society are corrected and satisfactorily resolved in the new society. The content of the novel also shows that the promulgation of the Marriage Law is very timely and necessary. This new author, who has published "New Events, New Ways" and "Thirty Work Points" in this journal, demonstrates his artistic expression ability in this article.

I

Little Yong was playing the game of "Catching Chiang Kai-shek" with several children when his mother, looking flustered, grabbed his little wrist.

"Oh! You really don't understand. You're a big man of nine years old, already married. You just rolled off the sedan chair and ran outside!" Saying this, she dragged Little Yong home. Little Yong resisted: "No, I don't want to go home, it's all adults..."

"Silly child, who is there? Your aunts, your cousins... who are you afraid of? ... Hurry home and have a grown-up conversation with them, let them praise you too."

"They tease me."

"Don't talk nonsense. Who doesn't say you've become a big boy!" Finally, the old mother exerted some strength and nimbly carried the nine-year-old groom on her back. Little Yong had no choice but to kick his little feet.

As soon as he entered the courtyard, people started clapping. "Yo! Everyone's here to see the new son-in-law!"

"Oh! Not only does he have to be carried, but he also has to chew on his godmother in the house!" The laughing people were holding their stomachs.

His mother immediately understood: After marrying a wife, even if the radish isn't big, it's still growing on your back. You can't be like a little baby anymore, you have to develop a husband's appearance. So, from her shoulder, she quickly peeled off Little Yong's hands. Little Yong didn't expect this and suddenly lost his balance—falling backward with a thud, and crying out, "Mom!" People all gathered around, some felt sorry for him and comforted him; others quipped from the side. Little Yong's mother was angry, anxious, and felt sorry for her child. The most important thing was to prevent the new daughter-in-law, or her family, from seeing it. In a panic, she saw a rosy face on the window glass of the bridal chamber. Looking closely, the black hair, curved eyebrows, and double-eyelid eyes, like a puddle of water, were staring outwards; the mole on the left corner of her mouth, like a black bean, was clearly visible. Who else could it be but the new daughter-in-law? This was terrible, especially terrible! Like dumplings with the filling exposed on New Year's Eve. The mother quickly stifled the latter half of Little Yong's cry. It seemed that Little Yong had made some progress after today's training; normally, he would have cried until his tears ran dry, his throat hoarse, his chest hurting a little, and he would have to drink a bowl of water before stopping.

When Little Yong entered the house, the aunts began to praise him; they said whatever sounded good:

"These two years, you've both gained wealth and people, you've both produced well, it's time for you to enjoy happiness."

Little Yong's mother was so happy that she blurted out what was in her heart: "It's all thanks to his aunts' praise, I can't do it alone. If it weren't for the Communist Party and Chairman Mao's good policies, we wouldn't have today!"

"That's right, twenty years ago, even in a dream, we couldn't have imagined today. Look, she's finally become a mother-in-law!" His eldest aunt patted her knee and complimented him like this. The old woman, walking around the room, said to everyone: "From now on, I won't worry about anything or exert any effort. The two of them will farm these ten acres of good white land, and I'll have three meals of congee a day, a single layer of clothing in summer, and cotton in winter. I'll be blessed enough—to enjoy a few years of leisure!" She was so satisfied that she almost burst out laughing.

"It's often said, 'Early son, early heir.' Eldest sister is only forty-six this year and is already ordering her daughter-in-law around, really..."

"Her relatives, good aunts, if there are any shoes or socks to be made in the future, just bring them over!"

Although people were saying this, for some reason, his eldest aunt sitting on the kang and his second aunt leaning against the quilt secretly turned their heads and laughed at the mud wall.

II

That day, it was already dark. The Women's Association director frowned as she walked out of the new daughter-in-law's room step by step. An old woman in her fifties gently nudged her: "Qiaoling, look, she really is a good daughter-in-law—with a big, square, white face. What do you say?"

"The daughter-in-law is good, but I'm afraid it won't last."

"I don't like to hear you talk like that. Look at their prosperous days, Little Yong isn't stupid, how could it not last?"

"Who marries things! Now that we've turned over, as long as a person's hands aren't made of mud, they can have a good life anywhere..." She waited for an old man to pass by, and then continued, "Little Yong and her, first, they weren't a free match; second, their ages are too different. Little Yong is like a featherless little sparrow, not old enough to get married. How can that work in the long run?"

"...With bones, you don't have to worry about meat. Could it be that there's no big because there's little? Just wait, won't the big road be washed into a river eventually?"

The Women's Association director lowered her voice further: "You can't wait until they're compatible. No one can wait for anyone's age. Besides, marrying a wife so young has no benefits at all."

"See, she just won't say anything auspicious to people!" She twisted her waist like a grinding wheel and shook off the Women's Association director. The Women's Association director also had her head full of questions as she stepped into the door of the Farmers' Association director's home.

It was late at night. Little Yong's mother chased everyone away and arranged for Little Yong to be in the same room as his daughter-in-law, and she was so happy that she wanted to laugh. She steadily walked to Chairman Mao's portrait, bowed three times, and thought to herself: Without the Communist Party leading us to turn over, how could we have been able to order our daughter-in-law around so early... to enjoy happiness? She then thought of the scene before the land reform and leaned weakly on the quilt, her ears ringing, her head feverish, vaguely wondering where she was. Two hot tears flowed down.

No sooner had this day become quiet enough to smoke a bag of tobacco than the young men hiding in the cowshed, the young women in the straw hut... all came out. They paced around the yard, taking steps that wouldn't crush ants, and finally stopped breathing beneath the window of the bridal chamber.

The ninth-day moon had already set in the west, leaving only a few dull stars in the sky. Some people were already feeling cold and wrapped their clothes tighter, saying: "Oh! It's really annoying to wait." Another wife bit a girl's ear and said, "Let's go! What's the point of eavesdropping on them?" The girl's shoulder twitched slightly, probably not agreeing very much. Someone next to her replied: "Be patient, eavesdropping has always been a losing business." Suddenly, someone gently tugged at him, and the sound of pulling the quilt could be heard inside the house. Everyone stood up, their ears almost breaking the window paper. They only regretted forgetting to clean their ears before coming, making them seem too useless. Before long, the new daughter-in-law let out a long sigh, followed by a very low voice murmuring: "Look, I've wet such a big patch..."

"Hehe..." "Ha..." "Pfft!" People could no longer hold back, and laughter erupted.

Little Yong's mother, awakened from her dream, rubbed her old eyes and ran out: "My dear children, it's almost dawn, aren't you going home to sleep! Aren't you working tomorrow!" Little Yong's mother was the most doting old woman. Other people's children were like her own. Usually, girls, wives, and teenagers all respected her and loved her like their own mother. She shouted those two anxious sentences and then gently pushed everyone, saying: "...Go, come tomorrow, I'll prepare something good for you..."

Just as Little Yong's mother was about to go to the gate, the Women's Association director stepped in. Little Yong's mother asked, "Where are you coming from?"

"From the Farmers' Association director's house." The Women's Association director stopped, and Little Yong's mother was stunned, listening to what she had to say. At this time, the Women's Association director had a bellyful of words, but she didn't know where to start. She was afraid of upsetting the old woman if she said the wrong thing, so she changed the subject: "Auntie, you go to sleep, I'll come to see the daughter-in-law again tomorrow."

Little Yong's mother felt very unnatural. After she left, she still held onto the two doorframes, sticking her head out and staring straight at Qiaoling's back; until that black shadow gradually disappeared, she was still pondering the taste of this.

III

Days passed, and things in Little Yong's family were changing day by day. The new daughter-in-law couldn't eat much, nor could she drink much. Little Yong was no longer as lively as before, always drooping his head, not even daring to go to the main street. The classmates at school all said that he was occupying someone else's wife; they also said that this was called immoral. That day, someone asked him: "...What do you marry a wife for?"

"To cook, to do chores." Little Yong replied simply.

"What else?" Little Yong thought for a long time, but there was nothing else, so he repeated: "Do chores, cook."

That person pointed at him and said: "Silly boy... haha." After Little Yong got home, he fell into his mother's arms and repeated what was said. His mother just sighed and sighed.

It turned out that the Women's Association director had just returned from a meeting in the county on the day Little Yong got married. As soon as she entered the door, her younger sister told her about Little Yong's marriage. At first, she was skeptical, but after inquiring with outsiders, it was all true. As it was getting dark, she turned around Little Yong's house and thought more and more that something was wrong. She found the Farmers' Association director and asked: "Little Yong is so young to get married, aren't the cadres doing anything about it?" The Farmers' Association director told her the situation: Their marriage, from proposal to wedding, only took seven days. According to rumors, her father didn't want her to be with someone else, so he hurriedly married her here. The cadres also studied this matter at that time, and there were many disputes. The Farmers' Association director's opinion was: No matter who it is, it should be stopped if they are not old enough to get married; the village chief said: Little Yong's family is a turned-over household after land reform, they used to worry about no one seeking them, but now that someone is seeking them, how can they not seek them? Both of these opinions had supporters. No one could convince anyone else. They talked until the rooster crowed three times and dispersed without a result.

IV

Just as it was getting dark, Little Yong's family was eating dinner, and the Women's Association director came to probe Little Yong's mother's tone. As soon as she lifted the curtain, Zhui'er understood, because she had talked to Zhui'er two or three times in advance. Zhui'er obediently cleared the bowls and chopsticks from the table and quietly retreated to the side.

After a few idle words, the Women's Association director asked in a very casual tone: "How are things going after marrying a wife?"

"Ha... please remember her, it's all joyous." Although she expressed it in her mouth and on her face, you could hear from her voice that it was false. "Hey, it's good to be happy, but I'm afraid that the two of them won't get along, that would be troublesome!" Little Yong's mother didn't answer, but her nose felt a little sore, and her eyes just went to look at the window. Qiaoling understood in her heart and said, "Little Yong is quite clever, the daughter-in-law is honest, what else is there?" Little Yong's mother shook her head, her eyes sweeping out the window:

"It's really making me worry, look, in a month, the child has become a tired cloth bag!" She also pointed to Little Yong: "This child used to be so lively, but now you can't get a word out of him for three sentences... Doesn't the daughter-in-law even let him?"

"Oh! How did it turn out like this?"

"How, it's not her fault to talk about. The silly boy doesn't even dare to step near her door. A few days ago, I gave my daughter-in-law money to buy good things, but he couldn't be led over, unless he fell asleep and was carried into that room. He would wake up crying in the middle of the night..." She lowered her voice again: "Her auntie, do you think she's disciplining him at night?"

"No, I heard people in her village say that she's very sensible."

"Her auntie, you may not know, I heard in the rumors that Zhui'er has someone else in Da Liu Village... I don't know if it's true or not."

Qiaoling immediately followed up: "If it's true, what if they want to ask for her back?"

"That..." She widened her eyes and couldn't answer for a long time, then fell headlong onto the pillow.

V

Since the day Little Yong got married, Qiaoling ran around, inquiring in other villages, and asking for instructions from higher levels, finally feeling at ease.

The branch meeting in the school was her suggestion. After she described the whole situation at the meeting, the Farmers' Association director stood up and said: "I still have the same reason, giving a little child a wife to marry, isn't that a joke? How can they live their lives in peace?" He was sweating profusely.

The village chief said: "It's very common to marry a wife at the age of ten." Before he finished speaking, someone in the west said: "It's true that children marry wives, but what have they been made into? Didn't Da Shun's family and Er He's family in our village die by jumping into wells and hanging themselves because the couples weren't happy and the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law didn't get along?"

"That's right, look at how old feudalism treats people. Now it's a new society, and this kind of thing shouldn't exist!"

The village chief's momentum was a little weaker, and he raised the question: "Speaking and doing things should stand firm, Little Yong's family is a turned-over poor peasant, should they be treated the same as ordinary people?" "Zhui'er's boyfriend's family is also a turned-over household!" someone in the east said.

"This is a matter of women's emancipation and freedom, not fighting landlords and dividing the spoils!" Qiaoling said loudly.

"We don't communicate our thoughts about Little Yong's marriage, it's not good for him, don't expect to enjoy happiness here." The Farmers' Association director's tobacco pipe was crackling with burning tobacco oil, and the meeting was proceeding enthusiastically.

That night, Little Yong was already asleep, and Zhui'er angrily patted Little Yong: "Wake up!" Little Yong's mother stopped her: "Don't, it's troublesome to wake him up! You carry him over there." Zhui'er was shy and refused, and her mother-in-law said: "Isn't it common for a big daughter-in-law to take care of a small son-in-law? When I was twelve, I came here as a child bride. At that time, his father was only six or seven years old. Not only did I have to dress him, but I also had to take him to play. Who didn't praise me as good."

Zhui'er braced herself to pick him up. As soon as she walked to the outer room, a dark figure in the yard walked straight into the room. Even though it was night, you could see that Zhui'er's face immediately flushed red; her heart was pounding like a hammer, as if she was stealing something and was being blocked by someone. The dark figure gradually approached, and she put Little Yong in the stove pit, then went up to meet him. Before Zhui'er could speak, the man asked in a low voice: "Zhui'er?"

"It's me." Also in a low voice. She pulled Qiaoling into her room, and Qiaoling said excitedly: "Da Kang is here, he's here to discuss something with you."

Zhui'er felt like a bolt out of the blue, her throat blocked by a mouthful of sour water, and she asked after a half bag of tobacco's worth of time: "Where is he?"

"At my house."

"He's come at the right time, I think we should run away today, right?"

"Run away to where?"

"Go to Guanwai to work..."

"Stop talking nonsense, the sky is ours, the land is ours, the government is in charge for us, we are not black people, why run? The old society's laws are outdated today!"

"It's killing me! I can't raise a fire of anger, I can't start a fight, how can I go to the government to sue?"

"Hey! Why look for a fight when there's reason?"

As they were talking in the room, they suddenly heard an "Ouch!" Little Yong's mother shouted in a changed voice: "My good daughter-in-law, no matter what, even if you smash the pot, drop the food, and burn the house, don't put my child to sleep in the wet place!" She came into the room and saw Qiaoling: "Her auntie, look, luckily I kicked him, otherwise... this little one, wiping his butt and peeing, like embroidery, one stitch at a time, is it easy to grow up?"

Qiaoling also felt sorry for him: "Yes, what will happen if he gets sick?"

Zhui'er pouted her small mouth on the side, lowered her head, and silently ate her suffering like a mute eating Coptis chinensis.

Qiaoling pulled the old woman into the room, and the mother-in-law began to cry to her: "Alas! People really don't want to live with us." Qiaoling persuaded the old woman, and the old woman poured out the true feelings and truth in her heart: "Marrying a wife and suffering, adding people and wasting land, putting bare feet in a蒺藜(蒺藜: tribulus terrestris) nest--it's difficult to move forward or backward."

"Sister-in-law, isn't the matter obvious? Do you have a number in your heart now?"

"Yes. Anyway, I can't say the word 'break up' first."

"That makes it easy."

"Alas! People will say about us again: I don't even know how to tell a daughter-in-law to work!"

"It's not about being able to tell or not. It's better to break up if it's not good, and it will be good after breaking up. Who laughs? Sister-in-law! You're only forty years old, and there's no difficulty in participating in the mutual aid group, so don't work if you can work.... Furthermore, Little Yong is in school, and if he's delayed, he'll blame you for the rest of his life; will he worry about a daughter-in-law when he grows up? Tonight, Zhui'er's boyfriend, Da Kang, is also here!"

She grabbed Qiaoling's arm: "Is it true?"

"It's true."

"Quickly figure it out! I've had enough of this kind of easy life, I've tasted this taste this month. Quick, quick."

"Auntie, I'm afraid you'll be uncomfortable."

"Why should I be uncomfortable? We broke up their couple, they don't know how much more uncomfortable they are!"

It turned out that Little Yong was pretending to close his eyes and heard every word. The little guy excitedly climbed up: "Auntie, quickly ask someone to take her away." Qiaoling put the little guy in her arms and said, "Good boy, we'll find our own partner when we grow up, someone who is literate!"

"No, I'll never be with anyone, it's really unnecessary!"

VI

No one slept all night. The next morning, as soon as a little light appeared in the east, the street was very quiet. Da Kang's mule cart "clattered" from the street corner to Little Yong's door. Zhui'er was also ready, and Qiaoling helped her move things. Da Kang carried the two bags of wheat he brought to Little Yong's house: "Auntie, your family spent money on this matter, and you can't let you lose both people and money. These two bags of wheat are..."

"Hey! None of us turned-over households lack this little bit of stuff."

"Auntie, if you don't accept this, I'll be very sad."

"Yes, since it's been pulled here, it's not good to pull it back, accept it," the cadres said. Little Yong's mother said to Da Kang, "Child, don't be as ignorant as this old fool, I didn't know anything about these things."

"It's not your family's fault, it's old feudalism!" Da Kang said.

Zhui'er walked over: "Mom! I'm leaving, if there's anything I didn't do well this month, tell me, I'll remember to change it in the future."

"Everything is good, clever and sensible..." She thought for a moment and then said: "...It's just that the thing last night made me..."

Qiaoling interjected: "Later Zhui'er told me that he didn't do it with bad intentions, he was just ashamed to see me so he did that. She wanted to go and hug you after I left."

The mother-in-law said: "Oh! If you don't explain it clearly, I'll have to remember this for the rest of my life. The child has also suffered a grievance because of this, and you, Auntie, have also spent your heart, I've gained wisdom from an event in my forties. In the future, my family doesn't have anyone else, I don't know if you'll recognize me as your godmother, I really like you..." The old woman's eyes were filled with tears.

"Mom, I can, I'm close to you, I'll come to see you often!"

The Women's Association director said: "That's good. Where would there be such a thing in the old society?"

Finally, Zhui'er said to the Women's Association director: "Sister, you've run your legs off and broken your heart for me, I'll learn from you in my work in the future!"

As soon as the sun showed its red edge, people gradually gathered. Zhui'er packed everything up, said goodbye to Little Yong's family, the cadres, and the neighbors, and sat in the cart. Da Kang also greeted everyone, raised his whip, and coaxed the lead mule to drive west. Before they had gone far, someone shouted from behind: "Wait a minute!" Little Yong chased after them with a package. When he got closer, he threw it into Zhui'er's arms: "Take this with you."

Zhui'er opened it and said: "Take it back, this is not mine."

"What's yours and mine, just take it, don't be shy," Little Yong said playfully. Then Little Yong's mother also came: "Good child, listen to me, these flowered clothes were made in my house, I don't have a real daughter, you are my goddaughter, who will wear them if you don't wear them? Take it as a souvenir, if you see it and think of me, come to visit this old woman..."

"I'll definitely come..."

Everyone said: "This is the right way to do it, it's better to break up well than to force it, a forced melon is not sweet."

The big mule was really fast, and it disappeared in the blink of an eye. Little Yong's mother breathed a sigh of relief and hurriedly picked up her hoe to go to the field to work.

　　强扭的瓜不甜
    谷峪
    编者按：本篇描写封建婚姻制度怎样还残留在经过土地改革后的老解放区农村中，但人民中新的力量已经成长，它终于战胜了这种不合理的制度。故事的发生是在婚姻法颁布之前，但由于共产党和人民政府的正确的领导、和农民群众觉悟程度的提高，在旧社会中往往成为悲剧的包办强迫的婚姻，在新社会中却是被纠正而得到圆满的解决了。小说的内容也正显出了婚姻法的颁布是十分及时和必要的。在本刊发表过《新事新办》《三十张工票》的这位新作者，在这一篇里显示了他的艺术表现的能力。
    一
    小勇正和几个儿童玩捉老蒋的游戏，他的妈妈娘气冲冲地抓住了他的小手腕——
    “唉！真不懂事，整整九岁啦，娶了媳妇的大汉子啦，刚从轿上滚下来就往外跑！”说着便死拉着小勇往家走。小勇打着坠悠（注一）：“不，不家去，净是大人……。”
    “死孩子，有谁啦？你姑、你姨、你表姐……怕谁呀？……快到家去，和她们拉个大人话，也叫她们把你夸夸。”
    “她们逗俺。”
    “还说傻话，谁不说你成了个大小子！”最后，老妈妈使了使劲，爽利把这个九岁的新郎背了起来。小勇没了办法，只是蹬达他那两只小脚。
    一进院，人们就拍起巴掌来。“哟！全都看新女婿吧！”
    “呀！不光叫背着，到屋里还要嚼嚼干妈妈呢！”笑的人们拧肚肠子。
    他娘马上就明白啦：娶了媳妇，萝卜不大也是长在了背上，万万不能再像从前似的，小奶孩一样啦，总要锻炼个丈夫样子。所以，从自己的膀肩上，急忙扒开了小勇的两只手。小勇没有防备这一下，一下子脚没站稳——摔了个后仰炮，竟“妈”的一声哭啦。人们全围了上来，有的怪可怜他，便安慰几句；还有的，在旁边说上一句俏皮话。小勇的娘，又生气、又着急、又疼自己的孩子。最要紧的，是怕叫新媳妇，或人家娘家人看见。在仓皇失措中，她瞅见新房的窗玻璃上贴着一个红润润的脸。仔细一看，黑黑的头发，弯弯的眼眉，双眼叠皮的一对眼睛，像一洼水一样，往外瞪着；左嘴角上的黑痣，像一颗黑豆粒似的明明地凸现着。不是新媳妇是谁呢，大糟糕，特糟糕！大年五更煮饺子，偏偏露了馅。妈妈娘急忙把小勇后半截哭声按了回去。看来，小勇经过了今天这个锻炼，似乎也进了一步；出在平常，简直非把泪水淌干、嗓子嚎哑、心口有点疼了，喝上一碗水，才算拉倒。
    小勇到了屋里，姑们、姨们，就夸起来啦；什么样的话好听就是什么：
    “这二年，又进财又进人，你们又生产的好，可该享福啦。”
    小勇他娘，乐的把心话全吐了出来：“多叫他姑、他姨们夸，光凭我可不行，不是共产党，毛主席主张好，那有今天呢！”
    “可不，二十年前，做上个美梦，也想不到今天。看，熬的当上婆婆啦！”他大姨，拍打着那膝盖这样捧。她老人家在当屋，打着磨游（注二）向众人道：“以后什么我也不操心下力啦，他俩口种这十几亩好白地，一天有我三顿粥喝，夏有我的单；冬有我的棉，我就足是福啦——享几年清福吧！”她心满意足的，差点快笑出了声音。
    “常说‘早有儿，早得继。’大姐今年才四十六，就支使上了那儿媳妇啦，真是……。”
    “他那亲姑们、好姨们，以后有个鞋啦，袜啦哩，尽管捎来做吧！”
    人们虽然是这样说着，但不知道为什么，坐在炕上的他大姨，和倚在被子上的他二姑，却偷偷扭回头去，对着土墙发笑。
    二
    当天，天已经黑了。妇会主任拧着眉头，从新媳妇屋里，一步一步地走出来，后边一个五十多岁的老婆，轻轻地划了她一下：“巧灵，看人家真是好媳妇——四方大白脸的。你说呢？”
    “媳妇好是好，就怕长不了。”
    “说话就叫我不爱听。看人家富足足的日子，小勇又不呆不傻，怎么长不了呢？”
    “谁和东西结婚哪！如今翻身了，只要个人的手不是泥捏的，到那里也有富日子过……”她等一个老人走过去，又接着说：“小勇他俩，第一不是自由对的象；第二岁数差得大，小勇和没有长全毛的光屁股小雀一样，还不到结婚年岁。日子一长，那怎么能行？”
    “……有骨头不愁肉，莫非有小就没有大啦？熬着嘛，熬的那大道冲成了河，还不行吗？”
    妇会主任再把声音放低：“熬到什么时候，也熬不到个相当。岁数谁又不能等谁。再一说，那么小就娶媳妇，一点好处也没有。”
    “看怎么样，就不会给人说个吉利话！”她扭了个辘辘把弯。甩开了妇会主任。妇会主任也是满脑袋装着问题跨进了农会主任家的门。
    夜深了，小勇他娘把人们撵净；把小勇安排到儿媳妇屋里，她心里舒坦的光想笑。她稳稳地走到毛主席像前，行了三鞠躬礼，心里想：没有共产党领导咱翻身，那里咱能早早地支使上儿媳妇……享福？她又连想到土地改革以前的光景，便无力的倚在了被子上，耳朵里山响，脑子里发烧，糊糊悠悠，不知自己到了什么地方。两滴热泪“噗哒哒”流了下来。
    这一天刚静了抽袋烟的工夫，藏在牛棚里的小伙子；草屋里的大姑娘……全出来啦。他们在院里，踱着踏不死蚂蚁的步儿，最后都停止呼吸地伏在新房的窗户底下。
    初九的月亮已经落在西边，天空中只留下几颗呆头呆脑的星星，有的人已感觉冷了，把身上的衣服裹了裹说道：“唉！真叫人等的发烦。”又一个媳妇咬着一个姑娘的耳朵说：“走吧！他俩有什么听头？”只见那姑娘的肩膀歪了一歪，大概是不怎样同意，旁边的一个人却答了腔：“沉住气，自古听房就是赔本的买卖。”忽然有人轻轻地扯了他一下，只听屋内有拉被子的声音。大家站了起来每人的耳朵几乎都快把窗纸弄破，只恨临来忘了掏掏耳朵，显的它太不管用啦。不大的工夫，新媳妇发出了长长地唉叹声，紧接着用极低沉的声音叨念道：“看，尿湿了这么一片……。”
    “嘿嘿……”“哈……。”“噗哧！”人们再也蹩不住啦，笑声一齐爆发了出来。
    小勇的妈妈，从梦中被惊醒，揉着两只老眼跑出来：“我那好孩子们哪，天都快鸡叫啦，还不家去睡哟！明天不干活啦！”小勇的妈妈，他是最疼孩子的老人，别人家的孩子就像她亲生的一样，平日里，姑娘、媳妇、半大小伙子，谁都尊重她，爱她跟自己亲妈妈一样。她把两句急话喊过去，便轻轻的推着大家道：“……走吧，明天来，我预备好东西给你们……。”
    小勇妈刚要上大门，妇会主任一脚踏了进来，小勇娘问道：“打那里来？”
    “从农会主任家来。”妇会主任停住步后，小勇妈楞住了，静听她讲什么事。这时妇会主任有满腔的话，就是不知道从那里开头，说错了怕老人生气，所以转了个弯儿道：“大娘你睡吧，明天我再来看媳妇。”
    小勇娘很觉不自然，到她走后，她还手扶两个门框，探着头，直望着巧灵的背影；直到那条黑影渐渐消失了，她还捉摸这个滋味。
    三
    日子一天一天地过去，小勇家里的事，却一天一天不一样啦。新媳妇吃不动，喝不多。小勇也不像从前那样欢蹦欢跳的，天天搭拉着脑袋，连大当街都不敢去。学校里的同学都说他占着人家的媳妇；还说这就叫缺德。那天，一个人问他道：“……娶媳妇做什么？”
    “做饭，做活。”小勇很简单地回答。
    “还有呢？”小勇想了半天，再也没有什么了，只得翻了过来说：“做活、做饭。”
    那人指着他道：“傻小子……哈哈。”小勇到家后倒在娘怀里一学说，他妈妈只是哼唉的叹气。
    原来小勇娶媳妇的那天，妇会主任是才在县上开会回来。一进门，妹妹就告诉她小勇娶媳妇的事啦，起初半信半疑，后来一打听外人，一点也不假。天将黑了，她在小勇家转了转，越想越不对劲。她找到农会主任问道：“小勇这么小就结婚，干部们一点也不管吗？”农会主任把情况告诉她：他们的亲事，连提带娶才七天。据风言风语的传说，是她爹不叫她和别人对象才急忙嫁给这里的。干部们当时为这事也作了研究，也有不少的争论。农会主任的意见是：不管是谁，不够年岁结婚就该制止；村长却说：小勇家是土地改革后的翻身户，从前愁的是没人寻，如今有人寻，那有不寻的道理呢？这两个意见都有拥护的群众。谁的道理也说不服谁。直谈到鸡叫三遍，也无结果而散。

    天刚黑，小勇家正吃晚饭，妇会主任便来探小勇妈妈的口气。一掀门帘，坠儿就明白了，因为预先她和坠儿谈过两三次。坠儿乖乖地把桌子上的碗筷收拾了，静静地撤到一边去。
    几句闲篇过去，妇会主任用很随便的口气问道：“娶了媳妇以后，日子过的怎样啊？”
    “哈……多叫他婶结记着，都是欢天喜地的。”口里、脸上，虽然这么表示，但从声音上，听得出这是假的。“哎，欢喜就好，就是怕两口合不来，那样就麻烦啦！”小勇妈没有答声，鼻子却有点酸的感觉，眼珠只是去看窗户。巧灵心里明白，说道：“小勇心眼儿挺精，媳妇老实，还有什么？”小勇妈妈摇摇头，眼睛往窗外一扫：
    “真把我愁坏啦，看，一个月的工夫，孩子成了疲布袋（注三）啦！”又指着小勇：“从前这孩子多撑达（注四），如今三言换不出一语来……媳妇又不知道让他？”
    “呀！怎么闹成这样啦？”
    “怎么，说起来也不怨人家。傻小子连人家的门边也不敢踩。前些日子，我给媳妇钱，买好吃的，也引不过去，除非睡着了往那屋里抱。半宿里醒了还是哭……”她把声音再压低：“她婶子，你说，是不是晚上她治他呀？”
    “不，我听她村里人说她可懂理呢。”
    “他婶子，你许不知道，风言风语里听说，坠儿在大刘庄还有个对象呢……也不知真假。”
    巧灵马上把话跟了上去：“要真的话，人家要向你家要人怎办？”
    “那……”她把眼瞪的圆圆地，半天也答不出话来，便一头倒在枕头上。
    五
    自从小勇结婚的那天起，巧灵东跑西颠，外村里打听，向上级请示，才算心里有了底。
    学校里的支部会是她建议开的。会上她叙述了一切情况以后，农会主任便站起来说：“我还是那个理，小孩子给娶上个媳妇，这不是笑话吗？他们怎么能一铺安心（注五）的过日子？”他出着满头大汗。
    村长说：“十来岁娶媳妇多着呢。”没等他讲完，西边有人道：“小孩娶媳妇有是有，那把人治成了什么样子，咱村大顺家、二合家还不是为夫妻不美、婆媳不合，跳井、上吊死的？”
    “对，看老封建把人治成什么样子，如今是新社会，这种事就不应有！”
    村长的劲头小点了，他提出问题道：“说话办事要站稳立场，小勇家是翻身的贫农，是不是和一般人同样看待？”“坠儿那个对象家也是翻身户呀！”东边有人说。
    “这是妇女翻身自由的事，不是斗地主分果实哩！”巧灵大声说。
    “小勇娶媳妇，咱们不打通思想不是向他——没有好处，别指望从这里享福。”农会主任的烟锅里烧的烟油“呲啦啦”地响着，会议热烈的进行着。
    就在这晚上，小勇已经睡着了，坠儿气冲冲地拍着小勇：“醒醒啊！”小勇的妈妈制止她：“别，喊醒了就费事啦！你抱过他去吧。”坠儿害羞不肯，婆婆道：“大媳妇伺候小女婿这不是常事吗？俺十二上给这里当童养媳，那时他爹才六七岁，穿鞋穿袜不算，还得领他玩玩，谁不夸俺好。”
    坠儿硬着头皮抱起他来，刚走到外间屋，院里一个黑糊糊的人影，直向屋里走来。别看是夜里，也可以看见坠儿的脸，立刻刷上了一层红色；心里“噗通通”地砸棒棰，好像她怀里偷的是人家的东西，正让别人堵住似的。黑影儿渐渐地逼近，她便把小勇放在灶火坑里，然后迎了上去。还没等坠儿说话，那人便低低问道：“坠儿吗？”
    “是我。”也是低低的声音。她把巧灵拉在自己屋里，巧灵兴奋的说道：“大康来啦，他来和你商量个事。”
    坠儿听了像晴天的霹雷，嗓子里被一口酸水塞住，楞了抽半袋烟的功夫才问：“他在那里？”
    “在我家。”
    “来的是时候，我看今天俺俩跑吧？”
    “跑到那里去？”
    “到关外去做工……”
    “净说傻话，天是咱的啦，地是咱的啦，政府是咱们当家做主啦，咱不是黑人，为什么跑？旧社会的法，今天过时啦！”
    “难死我呀！……突不起生气的火，掀不起吵架的岔，怎么能到政府去打官司呢？”
    “哎！有理为什么找吵架呢。”
    她俩正在屋中讲话，猛听见“哎呀！”一声吼叫，小勇妈变了声音的喊道：“我那好媳妇哪，千不该、万不该，就是砸锅摔饭点了房，也别把俺那孩子放在潮当地睡觉哇！”进屋一眼看见巧灵：“她婶子，你看亏着我踢上了他，要不……这从小擦屎把尿，和绣花似的，一针一线，容易长大的吗？”
    巧灵也很心疼：“是呀，病了可怎么着？”
    坠儿在一旁咕嘟着小嘴，低着头，就哑叭吃黄连了。
    巧灵把老人拉到屋里，婆婆便向她哭诉道：“唉！人家是真心不跟咱过了。”巧灵把老人劝住，老人便把满腹的真情实话吐了出来：“娶上媳妇受上气，添了人口荒了地，把光脚放在蒺藜窝——进退两难哪。”
    “大嫂，事情不是明摆着吗！如今你心里有个数没有？”
    “有。反正‘散’字不能先在咱嘴里嘣出。”
    “这就好办了。”
    “唉！又叫人家说咱啦：连个儿媳妇也不会支使！”
    “不是会支使不会支使。不好就散，散了才能好。谁笑话？大嫂！你才四十多，参加互助组什么困难也没有，趁能干活再不干……。再说，小勇正在上学的时候，要耽误了，他少不了要埋怨你一辈子；他长大了还愁个媳妇？今儿晚上，坠儿那个对象，大康也来啦！”
    她抓住巧灵的胳膊：“是真的？”
    “是真的。”
    “快快弄清算啦！这种清福我算享够啦，这一个月我算尝到这滋味啦。快，快吧。”
    “大娘，我是怕你难受。”
    “咱难什么受？咱拆散了人家两口，人家还不知多么难受哪！”
    原来，小勇假闭着眼，一句句都听到了，小家伙兴奋地爬起来：“婶婶，，快叫人家领她走吧。”巧灵把小家伙拢在自己怀里，说道：“好儿，咱长大自个对象去，对个识字的！”
    “不，一辈也不对哪个，真多余！”
    六
    一夜谁也没睡觉，第二天早上，东方刚现出一点亮，街上寂静的很。大康的骡子车，从大街口“咯噔噔”地赶到小勇门口。坠儿也拾掇好啦，巧灵帮她搬东西。大康把拉来的两布袋麦子扛到小勇家：“大娘，为这事你家花了钱，不能叫您人财两空，这两布袋麦子就算……。”
    “哎！咱翻身户谁缺这点东西。”
    “大娘，你不收下这点，我就难过死啦。”
    “对，既然拉了来，再拉回去也不好，收下吧。”干部们说。小勇娘对大康说：“孩子，别和我这老糊涂一样见识，其中这些事我一点也不知道。”
    “不怨你家，怨老封建！”大康说着。
    坠儿走过来：“娘！我走哇，这一个月的工夫，什么地方不好告诉我，我以后记着改。”
    “都好，乖巧伶俐的……。”她略加寻思又道：“……就是昨日晚上那事叫我……。”
    巧灵插嘴道：“后来坠儿与我说了，他不是出在坏心上，是碰见我害臊才那么办的。她想等我走后再去抱。”
    婆婆说：“呵！不说明白，这事我得记一辈子。为这事孩子也受了委屈，您婶也费了心，我四十多岁上经了一事，也长了一智。以后我家没有别人，不知道你认不认我做干娘，我是真喜欢你……。”老人两眼含着泪。
    “娘，可以，我亲近你，以后我隔常不断来看你！”
    妇会主任说：“这才好呢。在旧社会里哪里有这样的？”
    最后坠儿向妇会主任说：“大姐，为我你是跑断了腿，使碎了心，我以后工作要学你！”
    日头刚露红边，人们渐渐地聚来，坠儿把一切拾掇好，向小勇家娘俩，干部们、邻居们告了别，便坐在了车上。大康也向众人打了个招呼，扬起了鞭，哄着辕骡向西赶去。还没走多远，后边喊道：“等一等！”小勇提了个包袱追了来，近了，向坠儿怀里一扔：“拿这个走吧。”
    坠儿打开一看道：“你拿回去吧，这不是我的。”
    “什么你的我的，叫要就要得啦，还扭扭捏捏的。”小勇顽皮的说。随后小勇娘也赶来：“好孩子，听我一句话，这些花衣裳虽是我家门里做的，我没亲闺女，你是干闺女，你不穿谁穿？拿它做个纪念吧，你看见了它想起了我，就来望看望看这老人………。”
    “来，我一准来……”
    众人都说：“这是正办，好离好散强不过，强扭的瓜不甜。”
    大骡子真快，眨眼不见影啦，小勇他妈松了口气，急忙抗起了锄头到地里去干活。
    （注一）坠悠——向后挣脱的意思。
    （注二）磨游——来回转着圈子走动。
    （注三）疲布袋——失却活泼的态度。
    （注四）撑达——活泼。
    （注五）一铺安心——一心一意。
