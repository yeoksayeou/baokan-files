To the Editor:
    We read the report by reporter Lin Wei in the People's Daily on May 17 about the destruction of the Qinling forest area and were very shocked by the Chang'an County government's lack of serious implementation of forest protection policies and its indifference to the property of the state and the people. First, the Northwest Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry repeatedly notified the Chang'an County government to stop the destruction, but the county government never paid attention or reported it, which is a manifestation of a lack of organization and discipline. Second, production for disaster relief should involve organizing manpower and material resources for production, not using large-scale deforestation as a means to solve difficulties. This will not only fail to relieve the disaster but also create new disasters. Third, "When agricultural and forestry cadres inspected the Chang'an County government's implementation of previous forest protection notices, they couldn't even find the notices," which is a serious manifestation of bureaucracy.

    Therefore, we first demand that the Chang'an County government conduct a thorough review of this matter and publish the results of the review in the newspaper. At the same time, those who have neglected their duties should be given the punishment they deserve. Secondly, the other twenty-plus counties around the Qinling Mountains should also raise their vigilance and check their forest protection work. We also hope that the Northwest Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Forestry Bureau, and the director of the Qinling Forest Farm will learn from this experience, make timely summaries, notify the entire region, and earnestly do a good job in forest protection.

### 对秦岭林区遭破坏的意见

　　对秦岭林区遭破坏的意见编辑同志：
    我们看见人民日报五月十七日登载了一篇记者林韦报道的关于秦岭林区被破坏的情况，对长安县府不认真执行护林政策以及对国家人民的财产漠不关心的态度，非常骇异。第一、西北农林部历次通知长安县府制止破坏，该县府从不注意，也不报告，这是无组织无纪律的表现。第二、生产救灾，应该是组织人力物力从事生产，而不应用大规模砍伐森林的手段来解决困难。这样不但不能救灾，还要造成新的灾害。第三、“农林干部检查长安县府对历次护林通知的执行情形时，他们连通知都找不到了”，这是严重的官僚主义的表现。
    因此我们首先要求长安县府对这件事必须进行彻底检讨，并在报纸上公布检讨结果。同时要给予失职人员以应得的处分。其次，在秦岭周围的其他二十多县也要提高警惕，检查护林工作。我们还希望西北农林部、林业局及秦岭林场场长，记取这一经验教训，及时作出总结，通告全区，认真作好护林工作。
