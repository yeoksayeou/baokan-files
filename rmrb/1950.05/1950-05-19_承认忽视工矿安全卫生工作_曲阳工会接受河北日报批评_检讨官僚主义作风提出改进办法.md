　　Acknowledges Neglecting Industrial Safety and Hygiene Work
　　Qu County Trade Union Accepts Criticism from Hebei Daily
　　Reviews Bureaucratic Work Style, and Proposes Improvement Measures
    [Baoding News] On April 21st, the Baoding Hebei Daily published a news item on its front page criticizing that "cadres of the Qu County General Trade Union have a bureaucratic work style, which seriously damages the interests of workers." The Qu County General Trade Union accepted the above criticism, wrote a letter to the editorial department of Hebei Daily, made a self-criticism of the mistakes made in the past, and put forward specific opinions on improving safety work in the mining area in the future. This self-criticism was published on the front page of the Hebei Daily on May 9th.
    The news published in the Hebei Daily on April 21st pointed out: Cadres of the Qu County General Trade Union usually do not hold meetings, do not report to each other, nor exchange work information and opinions; they rarely study and discuss the instructions of the higher-level trade unions; in particular, they neglect industrial safety and hygiene work. In the past, an accident occurred in the Beicun coal mine in the Lingshan coal mine area of ​​the county, in which a worker was crushed to death by falling coal slag in the tunnel, and one worker was burned to death and one was injured in a fire. For this reason, the Ding County Central Trade Union transferred Pang Fuxiang, a member of the Qu County General Trade Union (the cadre in charge of leading the work of the Lingshan miners), to Ding County to report on his work. It also instructed him to immediately organize technical workers and relevant departments in conjunction with the Mining Bureau to conduct a major inspection of the coal mines after returning to the county. Any coal mine with poor safety equipment should be improved immediately, and those that cannot be improved temporarily should be recommended to the Mining Bureau to order them to stop work; at the same time, a safety and hygiene committee should be established to regularly inspect the safety and hygiene work of each coal mine. However, the Qu County General Trade Union did not earnestly implement this instruction, only paying attention to investigating the responsibility for the previous accident, but failed to organize forces to go down the well for inspection. Cadres and workers of the Honggang branch trade union in the Lingshan mine have reported that the ventilation in the well is poor, but this has not attracted attention. As a result, the mine did not repair the tunnel in time, resulting in a fire accident in Shanghonggang on February 23, which killed and injured 30 workers. Afterwards, the cadres of the Qu County General Trade Union also wrongly believed that "it is really difficult to avoid the death and injury of workers by using indigenous methods for mining," and did not humbly examine the responsibility of the trade union itself. It was not until the leading organs at all levels put forward their opinions that they began to make self-criticism. At the same time, the Qu County General Trade Union, in handling labor-capital disputes, has not correctly grasped the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, one-sidedly emphasizing taking care of the interests of the capitalists and neglecting the legitimate interests of the workers. Moreover, they are divorced from the masses of workers, do not approach the workers, and do not listen to the opinions of the workers, which has aroused the dissatisfaction of the workers.
    In its letter to the editorial department of the Hebei Daily, the Qu County General Trade Union accepted the above criticism, reviewed the bureaucratic work style in its work, recognized the seriousness of the mistakes, and accepted the lessons of the Shanghonggang fire accident in the Lingshan mine, and put forward three measures to improve its work: (1) Trade union cadres should strengthen their study, correctly grasp policies, establish the idea of ​​relying on the working class to manage factories and mines, and resolutely overcome the serious bureaucratic work style that currently exists. (2) Establish a safety committee in the mining area, and earnestly implement the system of technicians leading shifts up and down the wells and the system of workers handing over and taking over shifts; trade union cadres should regularly go down the wells for inspection, workers should report the situation in the wells at any time, and if they find that the tunnels in the wells are not up to standard, they should promptly suggest that the mine set a time limit for repairs; in the event of serious danger, suggest that the mine stop mining, and resume work only after the trade union cadres personally inspect the repairs. At the same time, improve the equipment at the wellhead. (3) Trade union cadres should humbly learn technology from workers and improve themselves.
    At present, the county's general trade union has placed its focus on the mining area and is working according to the above methods.

### 承认忽视工矿安全卫生工作　曲阳工会接受河北日报批评　检讨官僚主义作风提出改进办法

　　承认忽视工矿安全卫生工作
　　曲阳工会接受河北日报批评
　　检讨官僚主义作风提出改进办法
    【保定讯】保定河北日报于四月二十一日在第一版刊出了批评“曲阳县总工会干部存在官僚主义作风，严重损害工人利益”的消息一则。曲阳县总工会接受了上述批评，写信给河北日报编辑部，对过去所犯错误作了自我检讨，并提出了今后改进矿区安全工作的具体意见。此项自我批评发表在五月九日河北日报第一版。
    河北日报四月二十一日刊出的新闻中指出：曲阳县总工会干部平时不开会，不相互汇报工作，也不交换工作情况和意见；对上级工会的指示很少研究讨论；特别是忽视工矿安全卫生工作。该县灵山煤矿区村北煤井以前曾发生坑道掉煤渣压死工人一名和失火烧死、烧伤工人各一名的事件。定县中心总工会为此曾调曲阳县总工会委员庞福祥（负责领导灵山矿工工作的干部）到定县汇报工作，并指示其回县后立刻结合矿务局组织技术工人及有关部门，对各煤井进行大检查，对安全设备不良的要立即设法改善，一时无法改善的应建议矿务局令其停工；同时建立安全卫生委员会，定期检查各煤井的安全卫生工作。但曲阳县总工会对此项指示未切实执行，仅注意于追究上次事故的责任，而未组织力量下井检查。灵山矿上红岗分工会干部及工人曾反映井下通风不良，亦未引起注意。结果矿方未及时修理坑道，以致在二月二十三日上红岗发生失火事件，死伤工人三十名。事后，曲阳县总工会干部还错误地认为“用土法开采，实难作到不死伤工人”，不虚心检讨工会本身的责任，直到各级领导机关提出了意见，才开始作自我检讨。同时，曲阳县总工会在平时处理劳资争议问题上，没有正确掌握劳资两利的政策，片面地强调照顾资方利益，忽视工人的正当利益。而且脱离工人群众，不接近工人，不听工人意见，以致引起工人不满。
    曲阳县总工会在致河北日报编辑部的信中，接受了上述批评，检讨了工作中的官僚主义作风，认识了错误的严重性，并接受灵山矿上红岗失火事件的教训，提出了改进工作的三项办法：（一）工会干部加强学习，正确掌握政策，树立依靠工人阶级管理厂矿的思想，坚决克服目前存在的严重的官僚主义作风。（二）在矿区建立安全委员会，切实执行技工上下井带班的制度及工人交班接班的制度；工会干部经常下井检查，工人随时反映井下情况，发现井下坑道不够规格，及时建议矿方限期修理；有严重危险的，建议矿方停止开采，修好后经工会干部亲自检查再复工。同时改善井口的设备。（三）工会干部要虚心向工人学习技术，提高自己。
    目前，该县总工会已把工作重点放在矿区，并按上述办法进行工作。
