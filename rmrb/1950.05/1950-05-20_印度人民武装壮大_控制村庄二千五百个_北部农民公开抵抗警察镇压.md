Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: The Indian people's armed forces are growing stronger. According to a United Press report from Calcutta on the 9th, on the border of Hyderabad and Madras in south-central India, the people's armed forces control nearly 15,000 square miles of 2,500 villages. Guerrillas are very active in this area, and the police cannot control it at night. The Travancore area in southern Madras is called a "turbulent" area by the authorities due to the activities of the people's armed forces and people's demonstrations. In northern India, near the Nepalese border, peasants in most villages are in "rebellion" and openly resist police suppression. Indian Railway Minister Santhanam said that there have been 91 "sabotage incidents" on railways in the past six months.
    
Xinhua News Agency, May 19th: TASS, Delhi, May 17th: Indian Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Patel, in a speech in Trivandrum, called on the public to support the Indian government's actions against the Indian Communist Party. Patel said that influenced by the victory of the Communist Party in China, a section of Indian youth is trying to bring about a revolution in India.

According to Patel, armed uprisings have occurred in Malabar (southwest India), Andhra, and Bengal. Patel threatened to take punitive measures and demanded that the public refuse to "help the Communists and other people engaged in underground activities."
