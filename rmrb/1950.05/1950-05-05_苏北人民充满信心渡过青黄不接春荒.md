　　Northern Jiangsu People Full of Confidence in Overcoming the Spring Famine Between Harvests

　　[This newspaper dispatch] Reporter Yong Jin reports: The people of Northern Jiangsu are full of confidence in overcoming the "between harvests" spring famine. Northern Jiangsu was originally a disaster area, but due to the efforts of all the people to produce, the disaster situation has gradually eased, and in most areas the disaster situation has stopped developing or is shrinking in scope. This is because: 1. Under the national grain allocation, large quantities of food have arrived in Northern Jiangsu from Sichuan, Hunan, Zhejiang, Henan, and other places, and have been invested in water management, agricultural loans, trade, and other undertakings, which have played a significant role in supporting construction and supplying people's food. In addition, the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office has successively distributed more than 30 million catties of emergency relief grain to disaster areas, and has also solved the problems of seeds, etc. 2. Under the call of the Northern Jiangsu Administrative Office and the Northern Jiangsu District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party for various early-maturing crops and substitutes, in Yancheng and Huaiyin alone, more than 4 million catties of substitutes such as sweet potato leaves and sweet potato dried products have been collected, and more than 2 million mu of vegetables have been planted this spring. 3. Counties, districts, townships, and villages have launched a broad mass-based social mutual aid movement through people's representative conferences and agricultural representative conferences at all levels, achieving household-by-household inspections. The entire district (including grain saved by government offices) has approximately 10 million catties of mutual aid grain. 4. Under the principle of combining work relief with disaster relief, one million disaster victims have been engaged in large-scale water conservancy construction this spring. Allocating 250 million catties of grain can solve the lives of more than 1.1 million disaster victims. 5. The sideline production movement in the entire district has been carried out in a planned and organized manner. Such as catching fish, weaving, grinding flour, weaving mats, and pressing oil, which can solve the lives of 2 million disaster victims. Cooperative trade departments in various places are also actively purchasing sideline products from the masses. Currently, the amount of grain purchased has reached 100 million catties, opening up broad production avenues for the disaster areas. The people of Northern Jiangsu are tensely engaged in organizing to welcome the three major tasks of spring planting, river management, and overcoming the disaster. Many disaster victims are pushing grain home from the river embankments for spring planting, and their faces are obviously gradually turning red.

　　苏北人民充满信心渡过青黄不接春荒
    【本报讯】记者勇进报道：苏北人民满有信心渡过“青黄不接”的春荒时期。苏北原是灾区，由于全体人民的努力生产，灾情已逐渐缓和，大部地区灾情已经停止发展或正在缩小范围。这是因为：一、在全国粮食大调剂下，大批食粮已从四川、湖南、浙江、河南等地抵达苏北，投入治水，农贷贸易等事业，对支援建设，供应民食起了很大作用。此外，尚有苏北行署先后配给灾区急救粮三千余万斤，并解决了种籽等问题。二、苏北灾区群众在苏北行署及中共苏北区党委多种早熟作物及代食品的号召下，只盐城、淮阴两专区，即收藏山芋叶、山芋干等代食品四百余万斤，今春种菜二百余万亩。三、县、区、乡、村通过各界人民代表会、农代会，掀起了广泛的群众性的社会互济运动，作到了户户检查。全区（包括机关节约粮在内），约有互济粮一千余万斤。四、在以工代赈结合救灾的原则下，今春已有百万灾民从事大规模的水利建设。拨粮二亿五千万斤，可以解决一百十多万灾民的生活。五、全区的副业生产运动，已有计划有组织的搞起来了。如捉鱼、纺织、磨粉、织席、榨油等，可以解决二百万灾民的生活。各地合作社贸易部门亦积极的收购群众的副业生产品，现在收购粮已达一亿斤，给灾区开辟了广阔的生产门路。苏北人民正紧张的从事组织起来迎接春种、治河、渡灾三大工作。很多灾民从河堤上推着粮食回家春种，显然的他们的面孔已渐渐的变红了。
