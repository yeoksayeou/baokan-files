Xinhua News Agency: Mikhailov's Reply Speech

　　Soviet Youth Delegation leader Mikhailov's speech at the farewell banquet: Dear comrades, friends!
    The Soviet Youth Delegation will depart tomorrow and return to our motherland—the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. The delegation received a warm, fraternal welcome in the People's Republic of China, and we would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to our Chinese friends.
    The delegation witnessed how the Chinese people and Chinese youth are overcoming serious difficulties, fighting unyieldingly to build a democratic country and to consolidate the People's Republic.
    The delegation witnessed Chinese youth filled with a strong fighting spirit and a spirit of studying knowledge for the happiness of the motherland.
    The delegation witnessed Chinese youth filled with love for the Soviet Union and Comrade Stalin.
    The delegation witnessed Chinese youth closely united around the Chinese Communist Party and its leader, Comrade Mao Zedong.
    The historically significant victory won by the Chinese people in the struggle for the freedom and independence of their motherland has excited and inspired all honest people. The permanent and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples has such a powerful force, unparalleled in history.
    The New Democratic countries and the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union have a powerful and invincible force.
    I propose a toast:
    To the great Chinese people and its glorious democratic youth!
    To the new victories of the People's Republic of China!
    To the friendship between the Chinese and Soviet youth!
    To the leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong!
    To the great leader of the working people of the world, the great friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Stalin!
