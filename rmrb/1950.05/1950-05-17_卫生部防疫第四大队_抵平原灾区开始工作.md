　　Ministry of Health Anti-Epidemic Fourth Detachment
　　Arrives in Plains Disaster Area and Begins Work
    [From our newspaper in Xinxiang] The Fourth Detachment of the Anti-Epidemic General Team of the Ministry of Health of the Central People's Government has arrived in the Heze Special District of Pingyuan Province and has begun anti-epidemic work in the disaster area. The team, consisting of 107 people, arrived in Heze City on the evening of the 30th of last month. The next day, it consulted with the heads of the Pingyuan Provincial Government and the Heze Special Commissioner's Office to formulate an anti-epidemic plan for the disaster area. It was decided to first carry out anti-epidemic work in Liangshan and Nanwang counties of the Heze Special District. After achieving results and gaining experience, it will then turn to Jinxiang, Jiaxiang, and Yutai counties in the Huxi Special District. The team's tasks are mainly to carry out epidemic prevention injections to prevent the occurrence and spread of various infectious diseases in the disaster area, and at the same time to treat existing infectious diseases. Where possible, it will also assist local areas in establishing grassroots health organizations and laying the foundation for rural health work. As the team's medicines have not yet arrived, all personnel have temporarily organized a Yangko opera troupe, an investigation team, and a propaganda team to carry out epidemic prevention publicity and investigations into customs, dialects, and endemic diseases in Heze City. The Health Bureau of the Pingyuan Provincial Government, the Heze Special Commissioner's Office, and the Heze Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party jointly sent a letter to the team on May 7 to express their condolences.
