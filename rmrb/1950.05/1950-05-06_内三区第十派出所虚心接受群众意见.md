　　Tenth Police Station in Inner Third District Humbly Accepts Public Opinion
　　[This newspaper reports] The Tenth Police Station of the Inner Third District of Beijing held a police-civilian get-together on the evening of the 22nd of last month, and after listening to various opinions from residents within the police station's jurisdiction, the Tenth Police Station held an all-cadre and police officer self-criticism meeting. Based on the criticisms and opinions of the masses, the shortcomings in the work began to be corrected. For example, police officers chatting while patrolling and playing with the large rifle bolts, etc. When new police officer Qi Fushan, led by cadres from the police station, went to apologize to the households where he had been rude, Mr. He of Xin'an Lane said with emotion, "Now the police and the people are truly like one family." Mrs. Zhang said, "He (referring to Qi Fushan) is a new comrade who hasn't been working for long, and he's not very good at talking. It doesn't matter, no need to apologize." The suggestion made by peddler Bai Feng regarding the establishment of a police-civilian supervision team has been considered by the police station and is being prepared for trial implementation. Resident Qiao Qian requested that the police station install electric lights at the entrance to avoid inconvenience when going to the station at night, and they have now been installed.
　　In addition, the opinion raised by residents Zhang Yuhua and others regarding the lack of streetlights in Xiguan Hutong has been forwarded by the police station to the electric company for handling. Doctor Yang Yinong's suggestion that the sewer at the north entrance of Jixiang Hutong should be repaired has now been completed. Bai Feng criticized that the area in front of the Workers' Hospital was not clean enough. After the police station relayed this opinion to the Workers' Hospital, the Workers' Hospital has filled the ground and now pays attention to cleaning it every day. Qiao Qian's suggestion that a sewage pool should be built in Huazhi Hutong has been investigated on-site by the Environmental Sanitation Section of the Municipal Sanitation Engineering Bureau on the 28th. Zhang Yihua's opinions on the street cooperative, after being relayed by the police station, have also been studied and reviewed by the cooperative, and its work has been improved. The opinion regarding the excessively uneconomical handicraft materials at the Xiang'er Hutong Central Elementary School, which makes it difficult for students' parents to provide them, has also been relayed to the Xiang'er Hutong Central Elementary School.
