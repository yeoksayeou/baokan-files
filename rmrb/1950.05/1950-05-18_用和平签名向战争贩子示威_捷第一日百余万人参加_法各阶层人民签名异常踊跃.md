Xinhua News Agency, Prague, dispatch from TASS: The Czech people enthusiastically began the signature campaign on the appeal from the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. On May 14th, the first day of the Czech peace signature campaign, more than 1.4 million people had already signed the appeal. On the 15th, factories began to mobilize for signatures. Many enterprises held gatherings for this purpose. In the countryside, the entire peasantry of many villages unanimously signed the appeal.

Xinhua News Agency dispatch: TASS, Paris, 14th: The campaign to collect signatures for the appeal of the Stockholm meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress is underway in France.

Newspapers have published an appeal, signed by many Catholics, to ban atomic weapons. The appeal states: "We support the motion put forward by members of various parties in the National Assembly—including three priests, Gié, Guigue, and Groues—which calls on the government to make a suggestion to the United Nations: 'advocating the conclusion of an international convention declaring anyone who first uses an atomic bomb in war a criminal against all of humanity.' We support all efforts within various countries aimed at supporting and strengthening the will to uphold peace, and we especially support the Stockholm Appeal. We know that if world opinion forces governments to reach an agreement on the issue of abolishing atomic armaments, then the door to broad and perhaps decisive international negotiations on issues such as disarmament and the defense of peace will be opened."

L'Humanité published a list of social leaders in the Somme department who signed the Stockholm meeting appeal and the "Letter to the Residents of Picardy." The "Letter to the Residents of Picardy" calls on the residents of the city to sign the appeal. The signatories include mayors and deputy mayors of various cities in the Somme department, municipal councilors, provincial councilors, members of the National Assembly and members of the Senate of the Republic, teachers from university preparatory schools and other educational institutions, pastors, lawyers, famous athletes, leaders of the French Women's Union, and representatives of other democratic organizations.

The newspaper also published a list of leaders of various trade unions and agricultural organizations who signed the Stockholm meeting appeal.

The Federation of Educators affiliated with the General Confederation of Labor, at a meeting organized in Douai (Nord department) to protest the dismissal of High Commissioner for Atomic Energy Joliot-Curie, collected 1,050 signatures on the Stockholm meeting appeal.

The Standing Committee's appeal was unanimously adopted by the General Council of the Lower Alps department. The famous German writer Thomas Mann signed the appeal.
