The People are Peace-Loving
From Stockholm, Part 2 (Part 1)
Xiao San

Having come from China, a land of intense battles and restored production, and passed through the Soviet Union, a nation brimming with construction zeal, upon arriving in Sweden, I saw the beautiful, clean city of Stockholm and its composed people, who rarely betray their emotions. It seemed that in this remote corner of Europe, everything was peaceful and quiet.

The average middle-class Swede often appears indifferent and uninterested in everything. There's a Western joke that mocks people's slow reactions, saying, "Don't tell him a joke on Friday, or he might burst out laughing at lunch on Sunday (after two days and nights)!" Swedes often use "Northerners" as a self-deprecating or self-consoling term.

Another explanation, which is quite reasonable, is that Sweden hasn't fought a war since 1814 against Napoleon, a full 136 years. Sweden has been fortunate enough to maintain its "traditional neutrality" through both World Wars. Moreover, during the times of others' great wars, Sweden's big capitalists profited from war. For these reasons, the concept of peace has always been strong among the Swedish people.

But now things are different. The harsh reality has made ordinary Swedes worry. Although Sweden has not openly joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the ruling class repeatedly declares that it maintains neutrality. On March 22nd of this year, the Swedish government even issued a special declaration, reiterating its adherence to a "policy of neutrality" and non-cooperation with war blocs. (This is naturally smarter than Norway and Denmark. In this respect, the Swedish government has taken the people's opinions into account. The people are opposed to the U.S. imperialists' constant attempts to attract Sweden directly or indirectly into war blocs.) However, broad-minded Swedish democrats see that the government's so-called "neutral policy" is not genuine, because the current foreign policy of the Erlander-Undén government is almost that of a participant in the North Atlantic Treaty, completely following the dictates of U.S. imperialism.

The pressure from the United States on Sweden comes from several directions. Calling many diplomatic conferences, organizing prime ministers and foreign ministers from Scandinavian countries to participate. Regardless of the name of these meetings and discussions, the main purpose is to bring Sweden closer to the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Therefore, these many meetings are kept strictly secret. The most reactionary politicians are re-proposing so-called "limited military cooperation among Scandinavian countries," although everyone understands that since Norway and Denmark have already joined NATO, any Scandinavian "cooperation" cannot but obey the orders of American imperialism.

Swedish newspapers published a news item stating that in mid-March, the prime ministers of "four Nordic countries" met on the Lofoten Islands in Norway. The fourth country, of course, refers to Finnish Prime Minister Fagerholm. Ostensibly, they went for walks and fishing, but everyone understands that the one stirring up trouble and pushing the Scandinavian countries down a dangerous path is the overseas, American director.

Sweden participates in the Marshall Plan and the arms race organized by U.S. imperialism. Due to the ruling class's indulgence, a war mentality is being cultivated domestically. Swedish military figures are inciting anti-Soviet public opinion. On November 25th of last year, Swedish Commander-in-Chief General Jung gave a speech to students at Lund University, demanding preparations for an anti-Soviet war -- naturally to be conducted jointly with the North Atlantic Treaty nations! Sweden's warlords approved of Jung's provocative remarks. A naval commander named Strömberg, at a naval officers' conference, echoed Jung's tone, also speaking of "dangers" from the East and calling for an arms race. The government also supports them. Swedish Prime Minister Erlander told a reporter that Jung's speech was to maintain Sweden's neutrality. But Jung was clearly calling for an anti-Soviet war! In short, the Swedish ruling class is reprinting the war cries of U.S. imperialism in Sweden, faithfully implementing the policies demanded by the U.S. imperialists, while repeatedly declaring its "neutrality" as a smokescreen, the purpose of course is to deceive the domestic people. Especially when people remember that during the early stages of World War II and the Soviet-German War, the Swedish government allowed Hitler's troops to pass through Swedish territory to the front lines, providing the fascists with many conveniences and assistance, and only slightly restrained itself when the Soviet army gained the upper hand, recalling these things, people know the value of that "traditional neutrality."

The Swedish people have long enjoyed a life that seems to be one of peace and prosperity, but now their living standards are beginning to decline. Middle-class Swedes are finding life increasingly difficult.

This February, the Swedish magazine "Health Knowledge" published some such figures: In 1948, among Sweden's 3,368,000 independent residents, more than one million had an annual income of between 600 and 3,000 kronor (Swedish currency), but the annual living expenses of an average family were at least 8,500 kronor. Based on this incomplete statistic, one can understand the living conditions of Swedish workers.

There is numerical evidence of the rising cost of living in Sweden. From December 1948 to December 1949, beef prices rose by 25 percent, bread by 14 percent, and butter by 8 percent.

Swedish newspapers do not publish news of the Soviet Union's repeated price reductions, but are filled with anti-Soviet statements from the Americans.

Because Sweden has not openly joined NATO, there are not yet any American military advisors or military supervisors in Stockholm, as there are in Oslo, Copenhagen, and other NATO countries. However, among the approximately forty American diplomatic personnel in the Swedish capital, twelve are military personnel. In addition to military personnel, there are also many administrative agency representatives sent to Sweden to implement the Marshall Plan, as well as economic advisors. Therefore, U.S. imperialism is very familiar with Sweden's economic intelligence, and U.S. monopoly capital is increasingly penetrating Swedish industry.

The "grace" of the Marshall Plan to Sweden, as of today, is that Sweden's traditionally highly developed paper industry has shrunk, the shipbuilding industry has also declined, and the country's foreign trade has also suffered. The future of these industries is very bleak.

Like all capitalists and imperialists, the Swedish ruling class is attempting to further lower the living standards of workers in order to solve and overcome economic difficulties. Conspiracies to extend working hours and reduce wages have already been revealed by some factory owners.

　　人民是爱好和平的
    从斯德哥尔摩归来之二（上）
    萧三
    从紧张战斗、恢复生产的中国，经高度建设热忱的苏联，到达瑞典的时候，看见美丽、清洁的斯德哥尔摩城市，和这城市里稳重的、喜怒少形于色的人们，似乎在这欧洲的辽远角落上，一切太平无事，一切清静无为。
    素来一般中等阶级的瑞典人表面上似乎对什么事物都表示冷淡，不感兴趣。西欧有一个笑话，讥诮人们感觉的迟钝，说：“你不要在星期五对他讲笑话，当心他（经过两天两夜）在星期日吃午餐的时候喷饭！”瑞典人也常拿自己是“北方人”来自嘲或自慰。
    另外一种解释，也很合情理的，那就是，瑞典自从一八一四年和拿破仑作过战之后，到现在整整一百三十六年没有打过仗。两次世界大战，瑞典都没有转入战争漩涡，很侥幸地维持住了它的“传统的中立”。不仅如此，在别人大战的时期，瑞典的大资本家却发了战争财。因此种种，瑞典人的太平观念一向是很浓厚的。
    但是现在不同了。残酷的事实使得一般普通的瑞典人也担心起来了。瑞典虽然没有公开加入北大西洋公约，并且统治界口口声声宣称维持中立。今年三月二十二日瑞典政府还特别发了一个宣言，重申坚持“中立政策”，不与战争集团合作（这比起挪威、丹麦来，自然是聪明一些，瑞典政府在这点上是照顾了人民的意见，人民是反对美帝国主义者不断地想吸引瑞典直接或间接加入战争集团的企图的）。但是广泛的瑞典国内民主人士看出政府的所谓“中立政策”不是真的，因为埃尔朗德尔—翁登（Erlander-unden）政府现行的外交政策就几乎是北大西洋公约的参加者，完全听从美帝的指挥。
    美国对瑞典的压迫，是从几个方面来的。召集许多的外交会议，组织斯堪的那维亚各国的首相和外交部长来参加。不管这些会议啦，商谈啦……用的是什么名义，主要的目的是要使瑞典靠拢北大西洋公约侵略集团。因此这许多会议都守着严格的秘密。最反动的政治家们重新提出所谓“斯堪的那维亚各国有限的军事合作”，虽然谁都明白，既然挪威和丹麦都已经加入了北大西洋公约，任何斯堪的那维亚的“合作”就都不能不听从美国帝国主义的号令。
    瑞典报纸登载过一个消息说，三月中旬在挪威的洛佛屯岛上，有“四个北方国家”的首相会面。这第四个国家当然是指的芬兰政府的首相法格霍尔姆。名义上说他们是去散步、钓鱼，但谁都明白，混水摸鱼的，推着斯堪的那维亚各国走上危险道路的，是海外的，美国的导演。
    瑞典是参加马歇尔计划的，也参加美帝国主义所组织的军备竞赛。由于统治阶级的放任，在国内培植着一种战争的心理。瑞典的军事家煽动反苏的舆论。去年十一月二十五日瑞典总司令容格将军在隆德大学对学生演说，就要求作反苏战争的准备。——那自然是和北大西洋公约各国共同进行啊！瑞典的军阀们赞成容格的挑拨言论。一位海军统帅，名叫斯特列姆贝克，在海军军官大会上，学着容格的口吻，也说什么来自东方的“危险”，号召军备竞赛。政府也支持他们。瑞典首相埃尔朗德尔对一个记者说，容格的演说是为了保持瑞典的中立。但容格却是明明白白地号召反苏战争啊！一句话，瑞典统治阶级把美帝国主义的战争叫嚣在瑞典再版，忠实地执行着美帝国主义者所要求的政策。但却再三声明其“中立”作为烟幕，目的当然是哄骗国内人民。特别是当人们记忆起第二次世界大战和苏德战争的初期，瑞典政府让希特勒军队通过瑞典国土开赴前线，给法西斯许多方便与帮助，直到苏军获得优胜时才稍为收敛一点，想起这些，人们就知道那个“传统的中立”的价值了。
    瑞典人民很久以来侥幸地过着似乎安居乐业的生活，但是现在他们的生活水准开始降低了。中等阶级的瑞典人感觉生活困难起来了。
    今年二月份的瑞典杂志《健康知识》发表了一些这样的数字：一九四八年内，瑞典三百三十六万八千个独立的居民中，有一百多万人每年的收入是由六百个到三千个克龙（瑞典币名），但一个中等的家庭每年的生活费用，至少要八千五百个克龙。就凭这个不完全的统计，可以知道瑞典劳动者的生活状况了。
    瑞典生活程度的日益提高，有数字为证。从一九四八年十二月到一九四九年十二月，牛肉涨价百分之二十五，面包——百分之十四，奶油——百分之八。
    瑞典的报纸不登苏联几次减低物价的消息，但满载着从美国人那里来的反苏的言论。
    因为瑞典没有公开参加北大西洋公约，所以在斯德哥尔摩还没有什么美国军事顾问，军事监督之类，像在奥斯陆、哥本哈根及其他北大西洋公约各国那样。但是在瑞典京城的约四十来个美国外交人员中间，有十二个是军人。军人之外，又加上一些为了执行马歇尔计划的许多行政机关的代表，再则派什么经济顾问到瑞典来。因此美帝国主义对瑞典的经济情报，十分熟悉，美国垄断资本日益打进瑞典工业里去了。
    马歇尔计划对瑞典的“恩典”，截至今天，就是：瑞典素来非常发达的纸业萎缩起来了，造船业也萧条起来了，国家的对外贸易也受到损失了。这些产业的前途都是很黯淡的。
    和一切资本家、帝国主义者一样，瑞典的统治阶级企图再降低劳动者的生活水平，来解决、克服经济困难。延长工作时间和减低工资的阴谋已经从某些工厂主的口中泄露出来了。
