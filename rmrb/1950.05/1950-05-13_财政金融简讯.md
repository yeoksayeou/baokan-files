First, it clarified the idea of taking cooperatives and retail companies as the basis for promotion and selling goods directly to the hands of the masses. It also vigorously organized going to country fairs, temple fairs, and setting up small stalls to sell goods. In particular, it tried to provide convenience and benefits to farmers who came to the city to purchase goods. Secondly, it greatly developed consignment households and focused on integrating the professional company's list prices so that the prices of various state-owned enterprises were unified, eliminating the abnormal phenomenon that market prices were lower than list prices. In addition, the purchasing power of farmers has increased after land reform. In half a month, the company recalled more than 33 million yuan in cash from going to country fairs, temple fairs, and setting up small stalls alone. In April, the company sold a total of 23,191 bolts of various cloths, completing 92.76% of the total promotion task. (Cheng Binwu)
