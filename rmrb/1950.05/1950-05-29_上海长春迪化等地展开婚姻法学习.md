Shanghai, Changchun, Dihua, and other places have launched discussions and studies of the Marriage Law after its promulgation; some areas have also begun to promote and resolutely implement it. The Women Workers Department of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, in order to meet the demands of women workers in various industries, specially invited Tian Renping, presiding judge of the Civil Court of the Municipal People's Court, to explain the Marriage Law. He said that in the ten months since liberation, the court had handled a total of 4,197 marriage cases, of which 89 percent were filed by women, mostly due to abuse and bigamy by their husbands. He pointed out that the increase in marriage cases since liberation fully illustrates the extreme unreasonableness of the feudal marriage system under the rule of the reactionary派 in the past, and also shows that women's awareness has gradually increased since liberation, demanding to get rid of the oppression of feudal marriage. The Zhejiang Provincial Women's Federation called on women of all strata to study the Marriage Law and the People's Daily editorial "Implementing the New Democratic Marriage System" and strengthen publicity to resolutely implement and carry out the Marriage Law. When the Marriage Law was conveyed to the Jinan Municipal Women's Representatives Conference, which was in session, all the representatives applauded in support, and everyone believed that the Marriage Law has further guaranteed women's marriage issues.
	In Northeast China, the Changchun Municipal People's Court, in order to implement the Marriage Law, convened relevant groups to discuss the draft marriage registration measures and prepared to implement marriage registration. The Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government, the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Provincial Women's Federation, and the Harbin Municipal Trade Union, Communist Youth League, and women's organizations have also called on cadres to conscientiously study and publicize and assist the government in effectively implementing the Marriage Law. The Liaodong Provincial Women's Committee specially convened a symposium on the Marriage Law, and the Tonghua Prefectural Committee of the province also convened a meeting of women cadres to conduct a two-day study and discussion of the Marriage Law, criticizing some of the erroneous thoughts existing among cadres. In order to unify the understanding of the Marriage Law among leading cadres of courts at all levels, the People's Court of the Lüda Administrative Office specially convened a meeting of presidents of municipal and county courts.
	In the Central South region, the Wuhan Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau, in order to implement the Marriage Law, has handled marriage and divorce registration in various district governments of the city. The Henan Provincial Women's Federation and the Kaifeng Municipal Women's Federation have also called on cadres at all levels to conscientiously study the Marriage Law, focus on research and discussion, and widely publicize it, so that everyone can automatically abide by it and implement it.
	In the Northwest, women in Xi'an and Dihua have expressed sincere welcome and support since the promulgation of the Marriage Law. The Preparatory Committee of the Northwest Democratic Women's Federation specially convened women representatives from all ethnic groups, all sectors, and all organs and groups in Xi'an to hold a symposium on the Marriage Law. A Hui woman who had suffered from marital pain for a long time said with tears in her eyes after hearing it: "Free marriage and equality between men and women, this day has finally come, and the liberation of women is no longer a dream."

　　上海长春迪化等地展开婚姻法学习
    【本报讯】婚姻法公布后，上海、长春、武汉、西安、迪化等地已展开讨论、研究；有的地区并已开始宣传和坚决实行。上海市总工会女工部为适应各行各业女工要求，特请市人民法院民事法庭庭长田任平讲解了婚姻法。他说，解放十个月以来，该院共受理四一九七件婚姻案件，其中由女方提出的占百分之八十九，而且多是为了受男方虐待及重婚。他指出解放后婚姻案件的增多，充分说明了过去反动派统治下的封建婚姻制度的极度不合理，也说明了解放后的妇女觉悟程度已逐渐提高，要求摆脱封建婚姻的压迫。浙江省妇联曾号召各阶层妇女学习婚姻法及人民日报社论“实行新民主主义的婚姻制度。”二文件，并加强宣传，坚决执行和贯彻婚姻法。当婚姻法传到正在举行的济南市各界妇女代表会议时，各代表一致鼓掌拥护，大家都认为婚姻法对妇女的婚姻问题已有了进一步的保障。
    在东北，长春市人民法院为贯彻执行婚姻法，曾召集各有关团体讨论婚姻登记办法草案，准备实行婚姻登记。黑龙江人民政府、省总工会、团省委、省妇联及哈尔滨市工、青、妇女等团体、亦都号召干部认真学习宣传，协助政府切实执行婚姻法。辽东省妇委特召开了婚姻法座谈会，该省通化地委也召开了妇女干部会议，对婚姻法进行了二天的学习漫谈，批判了干部中存在的一些错误思想。旅大行署人民法院为了统一各级法院领导干部对婚姻法的认识，特召开了市县法院院长会议。
    中南区武汉市人民政府民政局为执行婚姻法，已在该市各区政府办理结婚、离婚登记。河南省妇联及开封市妇联亦都号召各级干部认真学习婚姻法，重点研究讨论并广泛宣传，让大家自动来遵照实行。
    在西北的西安、迪化二市妇女自婚姻法颁布后，都表现了衷心的欢迎和拥护。西北民主妇联筹委会特召集了西安市各族、各界、各机关团体妇女代表举行了婚姻法座谈会，一个久受婚姻痛苦折磨的回民妇女听了流着眼泪说：“自由结婚、男女平等，这一天到底来了，妇女的翻身已经不是梦话了”。
