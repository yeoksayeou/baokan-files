　　The New Czechoslovakia Marching Towards Socialism
　　——Celebrating the Fifth Anniversary of Czechoslovakia's Liberation
　　By Wanna, Reporter for "Rudé Právo," the Central Organ of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia; Translated by Xu Wen

　　Five years have passed since the Soviet Red Army drove the German army out of Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, eliminated the invaders, and liberated the entire Czechoslovakia. In just five years, the face of our country has completely changed. If we want to describe this change, we should first say: "The people of Czechoslovakia have become the masters of their own motherland."

　　The people of Czechoslovakia once had an opportunity to realize a future of happiness for the people, which was the establishment of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1918 under the influence of the great socialist revolution. However, at that time, capitalists, landlords, and other exploiters ruled the country, thus preventing the realization of this hope and continuing to enslave the people. The capitalist economic system was completely unfavorable to the poor people. During the economic panic, there were even one million unemployed people out of the country's 14 million people. Landlords owned hundreds of thousands of acres of land, while most peasants lived a painful life of hunger and cold. Finally, capitalist traitors colluded with Western rulers and sold Czechoslovakia to the Nazi bandits in 1938-39.

　　The capitalists surrendered, but the people did not. For five or six years, the people resisted the Nazis with guerrilla warfare, strikes, and the establishment of regular troops. Especially after the defeat of the German Kou in Soviet territory, when Czechoslovakia defeated the enemy, it naturally had to thank the heroic Soviet Red Army. This liberation did not allow the Czechoslovak people to repeat the mistakes of 1918 and firmly grasped the power in their own hands. Our success in building a new Czechoslovakia is due to the fact that the international situation is completely different from that of 1918: in the world, there exists a powerful Soviet Union that defeated Nazi fascism.

　　As for the domestic situation, in 1945, the People's Front, led by the heroic Communist Party, began to lead the people of the whole country in a resolute struggle against the bandits.

　　After liberation, under the leadership of their own party, the Communist Party, the people quickly began to establish a republic in the new history of the Czechoslovak people. The old bureaucratic system was abolished, and the "National Committees" that ruled the country's villages, cities, localities, and border areas were driven away. A joint committee of various political parties and people's organizations – the National Front – was established. All groups that supported the government's program participated in this committee. On the basis of Stalin's national policy, the long-unresolved issue between the Czech and Slovak nations was resolved. The property of traitors and Nazis was confiscated and their land was distributed to poor peasants and farm laborers. When the republic was established, all Nazis and their accomplices were expelled, and all banks belonging to traitors of the motherland were confiscated, ensuring that all departments and most of the industrial sectors were thoroughly nationalized according to the number of workers, approximately 65 percent.

　　All this was not only a success for the people, but also a severe blow to the reactionaries. A further blow was the victory of the Communist Party in the 1946 general election. At that time, the number of votes obtained by the Communist Party was 40 percent more than the number of votes obtained by any political party in the history of Czechoslovakia. Therefore, the reactionaries had to adopt new methods of struggle against the people's government. Some people joined the political groups of the National Front. Relying on the remaining economic foundation, they gradually carried out sabotage in various political and economic institutions.

　　In February 1948, the reactionaries believed that the time had come. Some reactionary cabinet members, under the orders of their American masters, announced their retirement, attempting to seize the country with a bureaucratic government. The people expressed a stormy resistance to this reactionary attempt. The people demanded that the traitors not return to the government. Progressive members of right-wing parties united to establish new institutions. The people's wishes were realized. A new government without traitors was established. In this way, important obstacles were removed on the road to socialism.

　　After the victory of the February Revolution, nationalized production was carried out quickly. To date, industrial nationalization has reached 98 percent, all external wholesale and retail goods have reached 66 percent, and the transportation industry has reached 95 percent.

　　In agriculture, land reform was implemented. For nationalization and the vast lower-level peasants, landlords with more than 5,000 acres of land were confiscated. Ninety-five percent of the Czech population is covered by state insurance. All elderly people have increased their income as a result of this state insurance. New factories are being built at the fastest speed in the most backward parts of the Czechoslovak Republic. Thanks to the initiative of many Communist Party members, the Five-Year Plan for the development of the future Czechoslovakia has begun and is being completed. In May 1948, a national general election was held. In this election, the people fully demonstrated their love for their government. 89.2 percent of the people voted for the People's Front headed by the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. The people completely triumphed. In June 1948, Klement Gottwald, Chairman of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, was elected President of the Republic.

　　The Czechoslovak people have demonstrated their love for the republic in their productive labor. The first year of the Five-Year Plan exceeded the set figures. After the February victory, countless people participated in factory competitions every day. Especially in December 1949, many factories achieved great successes and achievements in the competition to celebrate the 70th birthday of Comrade Stalin, the best friend of our people.

　　The recent major competition was attended by 30 percent of the workers, that is, nearly 415,000 workers.

　　The Czech countryside is also changing greatly. In machine tractor stations, tens of thousands of tractors and other farming machines help farmers work. Farmer collective work groups are constantly increasing, and a large number of farmers are happily going to the fields in groups.

　　The brilliant production achievements show the improvement of the living standards of the working people, and the enrichment of cultural life.

　　These are just brief production statistics of the Czechoslovak people in the five years after liberation. The Czechoslovak people would never have been able to achieve all these achievements without the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, the people's own party headed by Gottwald, and without the Soviet Union, the faithful friend of the Czechoslovak people who not only liberated our country, but also helped our country develop economically.

　　The people of our beautiful and prosperous motherland know very well that they have no fear for the future, and they are not afraid of any new invaders. Because they are a member of the powerful peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, this peace camp includes the glorious and heroic Chinese people with a population of 500 million. Therefore, the Czechoslovak people congratulate themselves on the fifth anniversary of their glorious road to socialism with new achievements. They know that the development of a free Czechoslovakia is a very good contribution to the cause of democracy and peace in the world.

### 走向社会主义的新捷克——庆祝捷克解放五周年

　　走向社会主义的新捷克
     ——庆祝捷克解放五周年
    捷共中央机关报红色权利报记者  万纳  著  徐文  译
    自苏联红军从捷克京城——布拉格赶走了德军，消灭了侵略者，解放了整个捷克，到现在已过去了五年了。仅仅五年的时间，我们国家的面貌就完全改变了。如果我们想叙述这种改变的话，那么我们首先就应该说：“捷克的人民成了自己祖国的主人”。
    捷克人民曾经有过一次可以实现人民未来幸福生活的时机，这就是一九一八年在伟大的社会主义革命影响下，建立的捷克共和国。然而当时资本家们、地主们和其他剥削者们统治着国家，因而阻止了这种希望的实现，并继续奴役人民。资本主义经济制度是对穷苦人民完全不利的，在经济恐慌的时候，全国一千四百万人民中，甚至就有一百万失业者。地主们拥有几十万公亩的土地，而大多数的农民是过着饥寒交迫的痛苦生活。最后，资本家卖国者和西方的统治者互相勾结，在一九三八——三九年把捷克出卖给了纳粹匪徒们。
    资本家投降了，但是人民没有投降。五六年来，人民以游击战争、罢工和建立正规军来反抗纳粹分子。特别是在苏联的境内，德寇失败后，当捷克战胜了敌人的时候，自然要感谢英勇的苏联红军。这次解放，不容许捷克人民再重复一九一八年的错误，而把政权紧握在自己的手里了。我们建立新捷克的成功，是因为国际形势比一九一八年完全不同：世界上，存在一个战胜了纳粹法西斯的强大的苏联。
    至于国内的局面，一九四五年，以英勇的共产党为首的人民战线开始领导全国人民对匪帮们进行坚决斗争。
    在解放后，人民在自己的政党——共产党领导下，很快地，在新的捷克人民历史上开始建立了共和国。旧式的官僚主义制度被废除了，统治着全国乡村、城市，地方和边区的“民族委员会”被赶走了。成立了各政党、各人民团体的联合委员会——民族战线——凡一切拥护政府纲领的团体都参加了这个委员会。在斯大林民族政策的基础上关于捷克和斯拉夫两民族间久未解决的问题得到了解决。没收了卖国贼和纳粹分子的财产把他们的土地分给了贫农和雇农。当共和国成立的时候，驱逐了所有的纳粹分子和他们的帮凶以及没收了祖国的叛徒们所有的银行，保证各部门以及大部的工业部门按照工人的人数，大约有百分之六十五彻底国有化了。
    这一切不仅是人民的成功，而且也是对反动者的严重打击。更进一步的打击，是共产党一九四六年大选举的胜利。当时共产党所得的票数比捷克有史以来任何政党所得的票数多百分之四十。因此反动派对人民政府不得不采取新的斗争方式。有若干人加入了民族战线的政治团体中，他们依靠着经济的残余基础，在各政治和经济机构中，逐次实行着怠工。
    在一九四八年二月反动派认为时机已到，部分反动的内阁阁员在他的美国主子命令之下宣告了退休，企图以官僚的政府掌握国家。人民对于这种反动的企图表示了暴风雨般的反抗。人民要求卖国贼别再回到政府来。右翼党派里进步的党员们联合建立了新的机构。人民的志愿实现了。没有卖国贼参加的新政府建立起来了。这样在向社会主义前进的路途中铲除了重要的障碍。
    在二月革命胜利后，很快地就进行了国有化的生产，到今天，工业的国有化已达到了百分之九十八，所有的对外的批发货物与零售货物达到百分之六十六，运输业达到百分之九十五。
    在农业方面，实行了土改，为国有化和广大的下层的农民，没收了地主五○○○公亩以上的土地。受到国家保险的，包括有百分之九十五的捷克居民。所有的年老者，因这项国家保险而增加了自己的收入。在捷克共和国最落后的部分，也以最快的速度，建设了新的工厂。由于许多共产党员的创导，开始了并完成着发展未来捷克的五年计划。一九四八年五月，曾进行了全国的普选，在这次选举中，充分表现了人民对自己政府的热爱，百分之八十九·二的人民投票选举以捷克共产党为首的人民阵线。人民完全胜利了，一九四八年六月，捷克共产党的主席哥特瓦尔德被选为共和国的总统。
    捷克人民，在生产劳动中表现了自己对共和国的爱戴。五年计划的第一年，就超过了规定的数目字。在二月胜利后，每天都有无数人，参加各工厂的竞赛。特别是在一九四九年十二月，许许多多的工厂，在为了庆祝我国人民最好的朋友斯大林同志七十寿辰的竞赛中，人民达到了巨大的成绩和成就。
    最近的大竞赛，有百分之三十的工人参加，就是说将近四一五、○○○工人参加。
    捷克的农村也在大大地改变着。在机器拖拉机站里，有成千成万的拖拉机和其他耕种机器帮助农民工作。农民集体工作组每天不断地增加着，广大的农民成群地、欢欢喜喜地走向田野去。
    辉煌的生产成绩，显示着劳动人民生产水平的提高，和文化生活的充裕。
    这仅仅是捷克人民在解放后的五年当中，简短的生产成绩统计数字。捷克人民所获得的这一切的成绩，假如没有以哥特瓦尔德为首的人民自己的党——捷克共产党，假如没有苏联——这个不仅仅解放了我们的国家，而且又在经济上帮助了我们国家发展的捷克人民忠实的朋友，那么，我们是永远不可能达到的。
    我们美丽的富强的祖国人民，他很清楚地知道，他对未来是毫无恐惧的，他不怕任何新的侵略者。因为他是以苏联为首的强大的和平阵营中的一员，这个和平阵营里，有五万万人口的光荣和英雄的中国人民。因此，捷克人民用新的成绩来祝贺自己光荣的走向社会主义道路的五周年。他知道自由捷克的发展，对全世界民主和平事业是有一定很好的贡献的。
