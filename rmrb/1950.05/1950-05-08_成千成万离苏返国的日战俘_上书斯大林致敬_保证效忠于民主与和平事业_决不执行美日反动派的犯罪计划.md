Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 7th. TASS Moscow, May 5th: As Japanese prisoners of war left the Soviet Union to return to their country, they wrote many letters to Stalin, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, and the Soviet government. These prisoners of war held mass meetings to discuss these letters. These meetings demonstrated the friendly feelings of the Japanese people towards the various peoples of the Soviet Union. In their letters, the Japanese prisoners of war expressed their deep gratitude to Stalin and the Soviet government for the humane treatment they received and pledged to fight to strengthen the peace camp and consolidate friendship with the Soviet Union after returning home.

　　One letter, signed by 66,434 Japanese prisoners of war, was embroidered on a 26-meter-long piece of silk, totaling 14,000 characters, and was equipped with wooden clips carved with a group of flag bearers.

　　The letter stated: "Only in the Soviet Union did we feel spiritually free for the first time and recognize the truth.

　　As we leave the great victorious socialist country, we swear to the people of the great socialist country and to you—the dear father and outstanding mentor of the working people of the whole world—that we will selflessly fight for the sacred and inviolable friendship between the Japanese people and the various peoples of the Soviet Union, because only this friendship can bring happiness, national independence and peace, freedom and democracy to our people. We know that the fundamental interests of the Japanese people are fully in line with the interests of the various peoples of the Soviet Union.

　　We will tell the working people of Japan the true situation of the socialist country in order to smash the anti-Soviet slanders spread by the American imperialists and the corrupt Japanese reactionaries.

　　We swear that the American imperialists and Japanese militarists can never again turn us into their obedient soldiers to carry out their criminal plans.

　　We swear that we will always be loyal to the cause of democracy, to the cause of peace and the friendly unity of the working people of all countries."

　　成千成万离苏返国的日战俘
    上书斯大林致敬
    保证效忠于民主与和平事业  决不执行美日反动派的犯罪计划
    【新华社七日讯】塔斯社莫斯科五日电：当日本战俘离别苏联返国的时候，他们写了很多信给苏联部长会议主席斯大林和苏联政府。这些战俘们曾举行群众大会来讨论这些信。这些大会表明了日本人民对苏联各族人民怀着的友好的感情。日本战俘们在他们的信中对于他们所受到的人道的待遇，向斯大林和苏联政府表示深切的感激之忱，并保证回国以后誓为加强和平阵营并为巩固与苏联的友谊而斗争。
    有一封由六万六千四百三十四名日本战俘签名的信，信文是绣在一条长达二十六公尺的绸子上面的，共有一万四千字，并且配有木夹，上面雕着一群旗手。
    这封信写道：“我们在苏联才第一次在精神上感到自由并且认识了真理。
    在离别伟大的胜利的社会主义国家的时候，我们向伟大的社会主义国家的人民并且向你——全世界劳动人民亲爱的父亲和卓绝的导师宣誓，我们将忘我地为日本人民与苏联各族人民之间神圣不可侵犯的友谊而斗争，因为唯有这种友谊才能给我国人民带来幸福、民族独立与和平、自由与民主。我们知道，日本人民的基本利益是与苏联各族人民的利益完全相符合的。
    我们将把社会主义国家的真情实况告诉日本的劳动人民，以便粉碎美国帝国主义者和腐败的日本反动派所散布的反苏谰言。
    我们发誓，美国帝国主义者和日本军阀决不可能再把我们变为他们的唯命是从的士兵，来执行他们的犯罪的计划。
    我们发誓，我们要始终不渝地效忠于民主的事业，效忠于和平与各国劳动人民友爱团结的事业。”
