　　Guaranteeing Revenue Delivery and Economic Construction Investment
　　Northeast China Re-Examines Local Budgets, Second Fiscal Conference Discusses Increasing Revenue and Reducing Subsidies

　　【Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 12th】The Second Northeast Fiscal Conference was held from the 20th to the 26th of last month. The main content of the conference was to re-examine local budgets based on the spirit of the State Council's decision to unify national financial and economic work, and to discuss the management of enterprise finance and village finance. Gu Zhuoxin, Minister of Finance of the Northeast People's Government, pointed out in his report at the meeting: Guaranteeing the delivery of revenue to the Central People's Government and investing in the economic construction of the Northeast are the two major tasks of the Northeast's financial work this year. Therefore, it is necessary to implement the overall concept, overcome difficulties, strive to increase revenue, and tighten expenditures to achieve a balance of financial revenue and expenditure and stable prices.

　　The conference first discussed the local financial budgets of the provinces and cities this year. At present, the financial revenue and expenditure budgets of most provinces and cities, including state subsidies, are still insufficient; and local revenue budgets are generally smaller than the actual possible revenue, resulting in large deficits. In the past, however, various localities only requested more subsidies from the state, and even emphasized local needs, exaggerated expenditures, underreported revenues, and increased the burden on the state. After inspection by the Ministry of Finance, it was found that revenue could still be increased (for example, Shenyang City's enterprise revenue could be increased by 250 percent after inspection), and expenditures should be tightened, and specific revision opinions were put forward to reduce state subsidies. In addition, some provinces have taken care of the overall situation, actively increased revenue and reduced expenditure, and did not ask the state for more subsidies, striving to achieve a balance of revenue and expenditure. For example, Rehe Province reviewed its budget twice, eliminating a deficit that accounted for 21 percent of its total revenue, and has been commended at the meeting. Songjiang, Heilongjiang, Jilin and other provinces, as well as Benxi and Fushun cities, which have a better foundation for financial and economic work, have all voluntarily agreed to reduce state subsidy expenses. Finally, based on the financial foundation of each province and city, the conference determined the amount of state subsidies to be allocated and revised the financial budgets of the provinces and cities.

　　The conference discussed the management of financial revenue and expenditure of state-owned and provincial-owned enterprises. At present, the investment of state-owned enterprises in Northeast China accounts for 53 percent of the total financial expenditure, and the submission of profits and depreciation fees accounts for 49 percent of the revenue. If investment is used unreasonably, and profits and depreciation cannot be delivered on schedule, it will have a huge impact on the overall financial revenue and expenditure plan. Some units have accumulated long-term state investments or misappropriated them at will, while delaying the delivery of enterprise profits and depreciation fees. Most state-owned factories and mines also do not calculate costs in a timely manner. To this end, the conference discussed and adopted the "Draft Interim Regulations on the Financial System of State-Owned Enterprises," which will be formally implemented after approval by the Northeast People's Government. The draft clearly stipulates the scope of use of investment and the methods of appropriation, profit withdrawal, and recovery of depreciation fees. The conference also pointed out that the delivery of profits and depreciation fees from local enterprises should become one of the main sources of local financial revenue.

　　When discussing the issue of village finance, the conference noted that although the phenomena of apportioning, waste, and corruption have been greatly reduced compared with the past, the examination of expenditures is not strict enough, and the phenomenon of insufficient revenue still exists, and the system of mass supervision of village finance has not yet been universally implemented. The conference believes that financial organs at all levels should have special personnel responsible for inspecting village financial conditions, strictly enforce rewards and punishments, and eliminate the phenomena of apportionment, corruption, and waste. Village governments must establish a system of democratic supervision of village finance. In order to strive for a balance of revenue and expenditure, all village financial revenues should be uniformly rectified, and financial expenditures should be tightened to reduce unnecessary payment items. The conference also drafted a "Decision on Implementing the Management of Village Finance," which will be submitted to the Northeast People's Government for approval and implementation.

　　东北重新审定地方预算二届财政会议讨论增加收入减少补助
    【新华社沈阳十二日电】东北第二届财政会议于上月二十日至二十六日举行。会议主要内容为根据政务院统一国家财经工作决定的精神，重新审定地方预算，并讨论了企业财政和村财政的管理问题。东北人民政府财政部顾卓新部长在会上报告指出：保证对中央人民政府的上解和东北经济建设的投资，是今年东北财政工作的两大主要任务。因之必须贯彻整体观念，克服困难，努力增加收入，并紧缩开支，以做到财政收支平衡，物价平稳。
    会议首先讨论了今年各省、市地方财政预算。目前大部省、市财政收支预算，包括国家补助在内，仍然入不敷出；而地方收入预算一般均小于实际可能收入数目，赤字很大。但各地在过去仅要求国家多给补助，甚至强调局部需要，夸大开支，少报收入，增加国家负担。财政部进行检查后，发现收入尚可增加（如沈阳市企业收入经检查后尚可增加百分之二百五十），开支则应紧缩，并一一提出修正意见，减少了国家的补助。此外，有些省能照顾全局，积极开源节流，不向国家多要补助，努力达到了收支平衡。如热河省两度审查预算，消灭了占收入总额百分之二十一的赤字，已在会上受到表扬。财经工作基础较好的松江、黑龙江、吉林等省及本溪、抚顺两市，都自动同意减少国家补助费用。会议最后根据各省市财政基础，确定了国家应补助开支的数目，改订了省市财政预算。
    会议讨论了国营、省营企业财政收支管理问题。目前东北国营企业的投资占财政岁出总额的百分之五十三，提交利润、折旧费占岁入百分之四十九。如投资使用不合理，利润、折旧不能按计划及时解缴，都对整个财政收支计划有巨大影响。有些单位曾对国家长期投资予以积压，或随意挪用，而对于企业利润、折旧费的解缴却又拖延，大部分国营厂矿对成本计算也都不及时。会议为此讨论与通过了“国营企业财务制度暂行规章草案”，待东北人民政府批准后即正式执行。该草案明确规定了投资的使用范围及拨付、提解利润、收回折旧费等办法。会议并指明：地方企业的利润及折旧费的解缴，应成为地方财政主要收入之一。
    会议在讨论村财政问题时，鉴于目前摊派、浪费、贪污现象虽已较过去大为减少，但开支审核不严，入不敷出现象仍然存在，且群众监督村财政的制度还未普遍执行。会议认为各级财政机关应有专人负责检查村财政情况，严明奖罚，肃清摊派、贪污、浪费现象；村政府必须建立民主监督村财政的制度；为争取收支平衡，应统一整顿各村一切财政收入，并紧缩财政开支，核减不必要的支付项目。会议并拟定了“关于贯彻管理村财政的决定”，呈请东北人民政府批准后执行。
