Xinhua News Agency, Jinan: Since Shandong Province began establishing children's teams in October of last year, as of mid-April, according to incomplete statistics, the province has 110,493 children's team members, forming 168 brigades, 816 detachments, and 3,145 squads. Among them, Jinan City has 17,195 members, accounting for 24.9% of the total number of middle school children and 60% of primary school children; Xuzhou City has 5,940 members, accounting for 25% of school children.

Before establishing children's teams, youth league work committees in various regions first equipped cadres for children's work at all levels, rectified existing organizations, and carried out team-building work in a planned and step-by-step manner. They first organized school children and then extended to out-of-school children, starting from large towns and cities with a good foundation for youth league work and concentrated children, and then extending to scattered rural areas. Before team-building in Jinan City, the Municipal Youth League Working Committee cooperated with the Municipal Education Bureau to convene a joint meeting of principals, teaching directors, young league members, and former Young Pioneer leaders of primary schools throughout the city to discuss team-building work and obtain assistance from all parties. In schools, they used extracurricular seminars, morning meetings, and Sunday activities to carry out publicity and education work on team-building. At the same time, they also conducted publicity among children's parents and the masses, breaking down parents' concerns that children joining the team would join the army and would not study hard; then they universally launched various learning activities and social activities to build teams. After the establishment of children's teams, they launched various daily activities of the team such as learning, cultural entertainment, and labor. For example, Xuzhou City used team days to enrich team life through cultural entertainment, singing, and visits to factories. Primary schools in various regions that have established children's teams have established close ties with school administrations. The children's teams hired progressive teachers from the school as instructors to guide the team's activities. For example, the organization of the teams in various schools in the Jiaodong area is combined with the class to carry out learning, which has achieved great results. In the Bohai area, in the meetings of the children's team every five or seven days, in addition to explaining political and cultural knowledge, the team members were educated on national ethics such as love for the motherland, love for the people, love for labor, love for science, and love for public property from the daily life of the children.

The children's teams in various regions are very active in learning, labor, and social services. For example, after the end of studies in Liu Jiazhuang Primary School in Jinan City, 136 models were selected, of which children's team members accounted for 133. Gao Jinsheng, a member of the Li Caixiu Village Primary School in Dongguang County, used to be a naughty child who liked to skip school. Since joining the team, he has been active in learning and participating in various extracurricular activities. In Xuzhou City, there are more than 10,000 out-of-school children. Due to the children's team's promotion of the "little teacher system," 4,525 people have been organized to study, accounting for 40% of out-of-school children. Children's team members in various regions also actively participated in social service work without hindering their regular studies. For example, in response to the call of the People's Government, they participated in the publicity work of selling public bonds and production relief. According to statistics from 11 districts in Jinan City, 9,557 team members participated in the publicity. The team members also took out candy money to buy public bonds, giving full play to the children's patriotic spirit.

Some areas do not have a sufficient understanding of the tasks of the children's teams, and believe that the children's teams are organizations of a few activists, which keeps a large number of children out of the door; after continuous correction, this tendency of closing the door has been overcome. In addition, there are still some shortcomings in the team-building work carried out in various regions: youth league committees at all levels do not have sufficient understanding of the importance of team-building work, and lack timely inspection and supervision of the work, which has caused the team-building work in some regions to fall into laissez-faire, and even individual counties and districts have not yet carried out experimental work on team-building; some youth league committees have not yet established children's work departments, and most areas still lack full-time cadres for children's work. The activities of the children's teams in some schools are too monotonous. In addition to learning, seminars, and discussions, there are too few other cultural entertainment, sports, and hygiene activities. These shortcomings are being corrected in various regions.

　　山东少年儿童队逐步发展
    队员已达十一万组成一六八个大队在学习上劳动上和社会服务等方面发挥了积极性
    【本报讯】据新华社济南电：山东省各地去年十月开始建立少年儿童队以来，至四月中旬，据不完全统计，全省已有少年儿童队员十一万零四百九十三人，组成一百六十八个大队、八百十六个中队、三千一百四十五个小队。其中济南市有队员一万七千一百九十五名，占中学少年儿童总数百分之二十四点九，占小学儿童百分之六十；徐州市有队员五千九百四十名，占在校儿童百分之二十五。
    各地青年团工作委员会在建立少年儿童队以前，首先配备了各级少年儿童工作的干部，整顿原有组织，有计划有步骤地开展建队工作，先组织学校儿童后推广到校外儿童，先从青年团工作基础较好、儿童集中的大城镇作起，再推广到分散的农村。济南市在建队前，市青年团工委曾配合市教育局召开了全市各小学校长、教导主任、小学中青年团员和前少年先锋队队长的联席会议，讨论建队工作，取得各方面的协助；在学校中利用课外座谈会、朝会、星期日的活动，进行建队的宣传教育工作；同时对儿童家长和群众也进行宣传，打破了家长怕儿童入队参军，怕不好好学习的顾虑；然后普遍地展开了各种学习活动和社会活动，进行建队。在建立少年儿童队后，就展开了各种学习、文化娱乐、劳动等队的日常活动。如徐州市曾利用队日，通过文化娱乐、歌咏和参观工厂等活动，使队的生活更为丰富。各地凡已建立少年儿童队的小学，都与学校行政取得了密切的联系。少年儿童队聘请学校进步教员为辅导员，指导队的活动。如胶东区各校队的组织与班级结合，进行学习，收到很大成效。渤海区少年儿童队每五天或七天的一次会议中，除讲解政治文化常识外，并从儿童的日常生活中对队员进行了爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物等国民公德的教育。
    各地少年儿童队在学习上、劳动上、社会服务等各方面的积极性都很高。如济南市刘家庄小学在学习结束后，评选一百三十六名模范，其中少年儿童队员就占一百三十三人。东光县李财袖庄小学的队员高金升，从前是个喜欢逃学而顽皮的孩子，自入队后学习积极，并参加各种课外活动。徐州市有一万余失学儿童，由于少年儿童队推行“小先生制”，组织起来学习的有四千五百二十五人，占失学儿童百分之四十。各地少年儿童队员在不妨碍正课学习的原则下，还积极参加了社会服务工作。如响应人民政府的号召，参加推销公债和生产救灾的宣传工作。据济南市十一个区的统计，参加宣传的队员有九千五百五十七名，队员们并纷纷拿出糖果费来购买公债，充分发挥了孩子们的爱国精神。
    有的地区对少年儿童队的任务认识不够，认为少年儿童队是少数积极分子的组织，使大批儿童关在门外；经过不断纠正，才克服了这种关门主义的偏向。此外各地在开展建队工作中还存在以下一些缺点：各级团委对建队工作的重要性认识不足，对工作缺乏及时的检查督促，使某些地区的建队工作陷于自流，甚至有个别县、区至今还没有进行建队的实验工作；有的青年团工委至今还没有建立少年儿童工作部门，大部分地区还缺乏少年儿童工作的专职干部。也有部分学校少年儿童队的活动内容太单调，除学习、座谈、讨论外，其他文化娱乐、体育、卫生等活动太少。这些缺点各地正在注意纠正中。
