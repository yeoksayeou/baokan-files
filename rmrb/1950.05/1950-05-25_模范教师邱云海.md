　　Model Teacher Qiu Yunhai

　　More than 3,000 workers at the Dalian Shipyard participated in amateur cultural studies. Last November, when the Lüda area held a model literacy movement award ceremony, the class led by teacher Qiu Yunhai (with more than 40 students) was awarded the special model class of the entire shipyard. In less than nine months of study, the students in the class, who were originally illiterate, generally learned 800 to 900 characters. Among them, five people learned 1,200 characters, and two people learned 1,400 characters. All of them could recognize, write, speak, and use them. Huang Tingjiang, a 44-year-old special-grade literacy model in Lüda, was the most outstanding student in this class. He learned 1,600 characters in nine months. The achievement of these results is inseparable from the name of teacher Qiu Yunhai.

　　During the model evaluation campaign, Qiu Yunhai, who was only 25 years old and had only a junior high school education, became one of the four first-class model teachers among the thousands of teachers in Lüda.

　　How was this "first-class model teacher" honor obtained? In Qiu Yunhai's own words, it was "determined to serve the workers, and determined to achieve results."

　　After accepting the task of being a worker's teacher, the first problem facing Qiu Yunhai was how to effectively ensure teaching time. Students studied in their spare time, and Qiu Yunhai himself taught in his spare time. If the time was not managed well, it would either delay the workers' studies or hinder his own professional work. Qiu Yunhai's first solution to this problem was to "plan and work hard." When doing his job as a warehouse clerk, he planned his work for the next day the day before. He made sure to handle all the work of the day within working hours. In addition, he sped up his walking and eating. For the same distance, others would stroll for 20 minutes, but he would only take 15 minutes. In the nine months of teaching, Qiu Yunhai had never missed a class or been late for a minute. On the contrary, he arrived half an hour early every day (class time was 7:00 AM) to help the early arriving students review the lessons. Arriving early every day gradually became a system, and all the students arrived early. There was a half-hour review time before class every day. Secondly, Qiu Yunhai tried every means to overcome all possible difficulties that could lead to missed classes. For example, when the weather was bad, estimating that it might rain the next day, he would mobilize the students in advance to come early even if it rained. He also set an example himself. In late July and early August last year, the Lüda area was hit by a typhoon, the power lines were broken, and various factories issued warnings. Many factory machines stopped running. Half of the workers could not go to work. Under such urgent circumstances, Qiu Yunhai did not delay the workers' studies for even a minute. He got up before dawn every day, made his own breakfast, and braved the strong wind and rain to travel from Si'ergou, a suburb 20 miles away from the shipyard, across three miles of uneven muddy paths, still arriving at school before 7:00 AM. His teaching spirit moved every student. Therefore, Qiu Yunhai's class was able to consistently maintain an attendance rate of over 91%.

　　In terms of leadership methods, Qiu Yunhai led the entire class to organize a student self-government association, mobilizing students to manage their own studies with their own strength. In addition to focusing on class and group leaders and active learners, he also personally went deep into the masses, used the power of the masses, and motivated students who were learning poorly. Often, a student who was absent without reason would be personally mobilized by three or four people and the teacher. Qinggong student Su Jixun only attended two days of class in the first month of school. After more than a dozen mobilizations by the class leader and others, it was still ineffective. Qiu Yunhai mobilized everyone in the class to mobilize him once, and taught them how to patiently persuade him. Su Jixun finally joined the study. Qiu Yunhai's method of mobilizing workers to enroll was to specifically help them solve difficulties. For workers who lacked confidence in learning, he assured them that they would definitely achieve results. Worker Cheng Shiming could not attend school because his mother was too old to get up early to make him breakfast, so Qiu Yunhai used his own practical example of how to cook to mobilize him. As a result, the problem was solved. Cheng Shiming studied very well.

　　In terms of teaching, Qiu Yunhai started from understanding the characteristics of the workers. He learned that the workers had a high level of political awareness and production technology. Therefore, he constantly strengthened his own political studies and tried to familiarize himself with production work. He never missed the factory's "Qinggong Lecture" and training class courses. He often read books such as "New Outlook on Life" and "On Ideological Awareness," to ensure that he did not lag behind the workers in political awareness and action. He learned that the workers' personalities were frank and straightforward. He was also sincere and frank with the workers. He would say he didn't understand the questions raised by the students and would not force an answer. He would only teach the workers after consulting others and studying until he understood. Because workers often have high demands on teachers, he always made thorough preparations before teaching a lesson. Sometimes he had to look up a word in two or three dictionaries. In order to prepare lessons, he often stayed up until 11:00 or 12:00 at night. During teaching, Qiu Yunhai constantly listened to students' opinions and improved his teaching methods. Initially, the workers complained that he wrote too fast, so he wrote each character stroke by stroke. Later, as the students progressed, they could not be satisfied with only learning the characters in the textbook, so he linked the characters in the textbook to other characters. Qiu Yunhai advocated four abilities (can recognize, can speak, can write, can use) and five attentivenesses (eyes, ears, hands, mouth, and heart). He advocated that workers connect learning with life. He taught workers to use the characters they learned to record their living expenses and write diaries. When eating, he would study the characters for eating utensils, and when speaking, he would practice writing down what he said. He also used expanded teaching methods, teaching workers to learn everywhere and at any time. He also paid attention to repeated practice. He set aside 20 minutes for each lesson for quizzes and regularly conducted formal exams.

　　Qiu Yunhai's teaching in this way was loved by the workers. Last September, when he was transferred to teach second grade, the original first-grade students were reluctant to separate from their teacher. More than 30 students in the class followed him to the second grade, skipping a volume. Qiu Yunhai squeezed out time at night to help them catch up. After two months, they all caught up with the second grade. They all scored 80 or 90 points on the exams.

　　模范教师邱云海
    蓝村
    大连船渠共有三千多工人参加业余文化学习。去年十一月旅大地区举行评奖识字模范运动的时候，由教师邱云海负责的那个班（学员共四十余人），被奖为全船渠的特等模范班。在不到九个月的学习中，班内原属文盲的学员，普遍认识了八、九百字。其中五个人认识了一千二百字，两个人认识一千四百字。都做到会认、会写、会讲、会用。四十四岁的旅大特等识字模范黄廷江，就是这个班里最优秀的学员。他九个月中认识了一千六百个字。这些成绩的获得，和教师邱云海的名字是分不开的。
    评模运动中，二十五岁仅有初中毕业程度的邱云海，成了全旅大几千个教师中的四个一等模范教师之一。
    这个“一等模范教师”的荣誉怎样获得的？用邱云海自己的话来说，就是“决心要为工人服务，并且一定要搞出成绩来”。
    在接受了当工人教师的任务以后，摆在邱云海面前的第一个问题，就是如何切实保证教学的时间问题。学员是业余学习，邱云海本身也是业余教学，如时间掌握不好，不是耽误工人的学习，就会妨碍自己的业务工作。邱云海解决这个问题的第一个办法就是，“有计划地紧张起来”。在做自己仓库员的业务工作时，他头天就把次日的工作计划好。一定要在工作时间内处理好当天的一切工作。此外，走路、吃饭也紧张起来。同样距离的路，别人蹓蹓跶跶要走二十分钟，他只走十五分钟。九个月来的教学，邱云海没有缺过一次课，没有迟到过一分钟。相反的，他每天还早到半小时（上课时间是上午七点），帮助早到的学员温课。这样每天早到，渐渐形成了制度，全班学员都早到了。每天都有课前半小时的温习时间。其次，邱云海想尽办法，克服了一切可能发生的误课的困难。如天气不好的时候，估计到第二天可能下雨，他就事先动员学员们下雨也要早来。自己并以身作则。去年七月底八月初，旅大地区被台风袭击，电线断了，各工厂告警。许多工厂机器停止了转动。半数工人不能上班。在这样紧急的情况下面，邱云海也没误过工人们一分钟的学习。他每天天不亮就起床，自己做好饭吃了，便冒着狂风大雨，从远离船渠二十里的郊区寺儿沟，踏过三里高低不平的泥泞小道，仍然赶在七点以前到校。他这样的教学精神感动了每一个学员。因此，邱云海班，能够经常保持百分之九十一以上的出席率。
    在领导方法上，邱云海领导全班组织了学员自治会，发动学员用自己的力量，管理自己的学习。他除了抓紧班、组长和学习积极分子以外，并亲身深入群众，运用群众力量，带动起学习较差的学员。往往一个无故缺课的学员，要受到三、四个人及教师的亲自动员。青工学员苏吉勋，开学后一个月只上了两天课，经过班长等人十几次的动员都无效。邱云海发动全班每人动员一次，并教他们如何耐心地进行说服，苏吉勋终于参加了学习。邱云海动员工人入学的办法，是具体帮助他们解决困难。对没有信心学习的工人，他就保证他们一定能学出成绩来。工人程世铭因为母亲太老，不能很早起床给他做饭，因而不能上学，邱云海就用自己如何做饭的实际例子去动员他。结果问题解决了。程世铭学习得很好。
    在教学方面，邱云海从了解工人的特点出发。他了解到工人的政治认识较高，有生产技术。于是，他就不断加强自己的政治学习，并尽量去熟习生产工作。厂内的“青工讲座”及训练班的课，自己从不缺席。经常阅读《新人生观》，《论思想意识》等书，务使自己在政治认识上与行动上不落在工人的后面。他了解到工人的性格是坦白直爽。自己对工人也诚恳坦白。学员提出的问题，不懂的就说不懂，不勉强解答。直到向别人请教及研究懂了，才教给工人。因为工人对教师往往要求很高，他每教一课书，必定预先作好充分准备。有时一个字要查二、三本字典。为了准备功课，常常熬到夜里十一、二点钟。教学的时候，邱云海不断听取学员的意见，改进教学方法。最初，工人嫌他写字快，他就每个字一笔一画地写。以后，学员进步了，不能满足于只教课本上的字，他就从课本上的字联系到其他的字。邱云海提倡四会（会认，会讲，会写，会用）、五到（眼到、耳到、手到、口到、心到）。主张工人们把学习和生活联系起来。教工人用学得的字记自己的生活账，记日记。吃饭时就研究吃饭用具的字，说话时，就练习把话记下来。他并用扩大教学法，教工人们随处学，随时学。又注意反复练习。每课要留二十分钟进行小测验，定期作正规考试。
    邱云海这样地教学，得到了工人们的热爱。去年九月当他被调去教二年级的时候，原来一年级的学员舍不得和自己的教师分离。全班三十多个学员，跟他到了二年级，跳了一册。邱云海又挤出夜里的时间，帮他们补课。经过两个月，都赶上了二年级。考试时都得八、九十分。
