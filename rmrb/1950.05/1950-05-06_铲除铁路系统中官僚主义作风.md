　　Eradicating Bureaucratic Work Style in the Railway System
    Teng Daiyuan

    In 1949, our national railway employees and commanders and fighters of the Railway Corps, together with the people of the whole country, bravely rushed to repair the national railways, which played a significant role in accelerating the cause of national liberation. We will forever share the glory of the people's victory. However, does this mean that our railways are doing very well? Not yet! Just looking at the series of shortcomings exposed in the transportation order in the first quarter of this year is enough to show that our railways are not doing well or not well enough. If we are not clear about this, we will cause serious losses to the people's railway cause.

    There is no doubt that the achievements we have made in the past year are not small. However, we still have many and extremely serious shortcomings. First, in terms of line maintenance. Although the Ministry of Railways has repeatedly pointed out the very poor condition of the lines last year and carried out a major repair and demonstration of new road maintenance methods, the line conditions south of Xuzhou under the jurisdiction of the Zhengzhou Bureau and the Jinan Bureau are still extremely poor this year. The Zhengzhou Bureau implemented 200 kilometers of new road maintenance methods, but not a single kilometer has been seriously inspected and accepted. Rail spikes are floating up, and some rail spikes can even be pulled up by hand. The chief of the Zhengzhou-Xinyang engineering section knows nothing about road maintenance work. The situation of roadbed mud pumping, water accumulation, and subsidence south of Xuzhou is very serious. The decay of sleepers reaches 40% to 50%.

    In March, the Ministry of Railways inspected the signal lights of railway switches nationwide. Among the 16,685 sets of switches inspected, 67% were unqualified. Among them, almost 100% of the Taiyuan Bureau's switches were unqualified.

    The condition of locomotives and vehicles is also very poor. In just January and February, there were 1,279 cases of damage and failure.

    The existence of the above situation obviously cannot guarantee traffic safety.

    From the vehicle inventory, we can see the extent of our past sloppy work. The Northeast People's Railway has been operating for three or four years, and the Guannei (area south of Shanhaiguan) has been operating for one or two years, but more than 10,000 uncounted vehicles have been inventoried.

    In January and February, train delays increased in the northern and southern railway bureaus. The maximum on-time departure rate was only 50% to 70%; the on-time arrival rate was less than 50%, and some administrations even had less than 10%. Some passenger cars are very dirty, the order is very chaotic, passengers are crowded, and the service attitude of some railway staff is not good enough.

    In January and February, a total of 4,622 first-class accidents occurred on railways nationwide, and many serious major accidents occurred. Facts have proved that we are not good at using scientific methods to run railways in many places.

    The phenomena of corruption and waste are equally alarming. The Zhengzhou Bureau's water tower corruption case, the Tianjin Bureau's material embezzlement, and the Northeast General Bureau's material embezzlement case last year all involved large amounts of money.

    Material storage work is also not done well in some places. Many important materials are not recorded or are omitted. A large number of materials are placed in the open air to rust and corrode. Some material clerks do not know the number of materials, and individual material directors do not know how many warehouses there are.

    Why haven't these serious problems aroused everyone's vigilance and attention? It is because some cadres in the railway work system have deviations in their ideological understanding.

    Some people think that our railways are doing well, at least better than during the Kuomintang period. Therefore, they like to report achievements but not mistakes, report good news but not bad news, paralyze themselves, and lose the drive to move forward. Indeed, the people's railways are a little better than the railways run by the Kuomintang reactionary government. But do we only demand this little bit of improvement? Obviously, there is no basis for us to be satisfied with the status quo.

    Some people think that these small things are unavoidable, so why bother so much? However, one thing may be a small thing, but countless small things accumulate into big things. It is because we have some people who are big and useless, and do not care about small things, which creates countless loopholes in the railway, causing the people's blood and sweat and millet to suffer many unnecessary losses.

    Some people think that the equipment is not good, materials are lacking, and the requirements are high, so what can be done? Indeed, it is impossible for the equipment to get better quickly, and it is impossible for the materials to be sufficient quickly. This is a problem that cannot be completely solved in the short term in the construction of New China. And the needs of the people must be gradually improved, which is indeed a difficult thing to do. But the problem is not in the difficulty, but in whether we have done what we can do? Have we done our best to improve the equipment? For example, among the unqualified switches in the Tianjin Bureau, 51% can be corrected with just a little effort; colored lights can be brighter to maintain bright colors; signal positions can be used by simply moving them; rail spikes floating on good sleepers can be hammered down with a few hammers; screws can be tightened; ballast can be tamped; rails can be straightened; trains can be directed and dispatched according to the timetable; passenger station areas can be cleaned; and services to passengers and shippers can be more diligent and thoughtful. Can it be said that these things have not been done well because of poor equipment and insufficient materials? Obviously, it cannot be attributed to equipment and materials. What's more, we still have some materials that are frozen and not used? In this way, the demands of the people are not too high, but the effort is not enough.

    Some people also say: I am a layman, so things are not done well. However, if you are a layman, you should study harder and more humbly. Chairman Mao instructed us to learn our own business within half a year, one year, or two or three years. The Northeast People's Railway has been in existence for nearly four years, and Guannei has been in existence for more than one year; there is all the necessary equipment, there are thousands of workers, and there are Chinese and Soviet experts with us. If you are willing to learn, at least some basic knowledge should be learned, right? General common sense such as rail spikes floating, screws loosening, ballast buried, lights dimmed, locomotive leaks, and train delays that hinder traffic safety and transportation order, is there still a long time to learn? All technology is created by labor. As long as you are willing to learn, anyone can understand their own business.

    Therefore, the problem lies in the existence of bureaucratic work style. In the railway work system, and in other work systems, as long as we pay a little attention, we will encounter some muddle-headed and decadent elements who are still entrenched in leadership positions. They are full of food and have nothing to do all day long, holding a work attitude of muddling along, fearing to take responsibility and fearing to offend people. Their specialty is playing with documents and flattering superiors. A document is approved by the bureau chief for "verification and handling"; the department chief approves "compliance"; the section chief approves "implementation". The Shanghai Bureau had a document travel in the office for 172 days for a telephone, and the problem was still not resolved. They spend all day urging reports and forms, which become a burden when they arrive on the table. Among the 160-odd projects of the Zhengzhou Bureau in 1949, only a little more than 2% were reimbursed. The rest became a mess because you came and I went. They are respectful to their superiors, saying one thing but thinking another. They feel satisfied as long as they live freely.

    There are also some lazy thinkers who do not use their brains. They are good at parrying trivial matters coming from all directions, working hard, forgetting to eat and sleep, handling one item at a time, with no focus on their work, without consideration, liking to take everything on themselves, issuing orders, thinking that this is leadership. Comrade Zhang Fen, director of the engineering department of the Zhengzhou Bureau, said: "I am busy until two or three in the morning every day before going to bed, but I rarely understand the work situation and existing problems, so I didn't know about the water tower corruption case until a few months later." Waste their limited energy, so there is no time to think and study problems. Naturally, they will lose their vigilance against corrupt things and lose their sensitivity to new things. They are the powerful assistants of bureaucracy, using a busy form to support bureaucracy.

    There are also some comrades who like to talk about policies, principles, plans, and resolutions, talk about empty grand principles, and have nothing to do with actual work. Before making a decision, they do not consider whether it is consistent with the actual situation; after announcing it, they do not check how the implementation is going; thinking that they have given all the leadership responsibilities after talking about policies and principles and making plans and decisions, and the rest are just small things, which are done by the subordinates. They shout slogans to eliminate accidents and on-time operation, but they do not repair switches, tighten rail spikes, tighten screws, tamp ballast, repair locomotives, or check timetables. Therefore, one policy on the left, one plan on the right, one resolution after another, one movement after another, but things remain the same. A series of resolutions and plans fail, and no lessons can be learned. They think that talking empty words seems easier than doing actual work. This is a group of sincere empty talkers. In terms of work effect, they are no different from decadent bureaucracy.

    The difference between the above-mentioned bureaucracy is: the bureaucracy shown by the old bureaucrats is easily seen and easily arouses opposition from the masses; while those hard-working people who think they have no credit but also have hard work, or use political slogans to cover up their bureaucracy, this kind of bureaucracy is not only easy to confuse people, but most of them are in positions of power, so the harm is even greater.

    The common point of these bureaucratic work styles is that they are divorced from reality and divorced from the masses. The more specific the work, the less responsible people are. Some of our responsible persons do not know how many people, how many machines, how many tools, or how many materials there are in their unit; they also do not know what to do today and what to do tomorrow. They are completely in the dark about the situation and do not understand the ideological emotions of the workers and masses at all; they turn a blind eye to the creations and brand-new records of the workers and masses, and do not support them, but even nitpick and suppress them, thinking that they are small people and small things, and are not worth mentioning. Since liberation, many heroic figures have emerged among the workers and masses, and many miracles have been created, but most of them have been buried by bureaucrats. Even the heroes who have already risen are allowed to fend for themselves, and they are not supported and cultivated to give play to their leading role. Therefore, democratic management, rationalization proposals, and the Mao Zedong locomotive movement have not been well developed. On the contrary, disobedience, corruption, concealing from superiors but not from subordinates, engaging in factionalism, irresponsibility, and sabotage of labor discipline are common and not surprising phenomena in some administrations and sub-bureaus. In the second half of 1949 (July to December), the Zhengzhou Bureau had 1,006 first-class accidents, and trains derailed every day, even several times a day, and a train derailed three times in a row at one station, but no severe punishment was given. The major accidents in January and February were all caused by violations of regulations and sabotage of labor discipline. This is the evil consequence of bureaucratic work style on the railways.

    Why is bureaucratic work style so serious and long-standing on the railways? Because when we took over the railways and all their equipment left by the enemy and puppet reactionaries, we also accepted the bureaucratic work style left by the enemy and puppet reactionaries, and we did not have time to systematically launch a struggle against it in the process of restoring the railways. The policy of relying on the workers has not been universally implemented, the workers and masses have not been fully mobilized, and democratic management has not been fully realized. This has given the bureaucrats a base to retain. In addition, the weapon of criticism and self-criticism has not been universally grasped and used by the cadres of our party and political departments, which makes the party and political work weak and unable to resist the attack of bureaucracy.

    It must be pointed out that even now, many responsible cadres are still vague about the policy of relying on the workers and masses to restore and develop production. Therefore, they are unwilling to seriously organize management committees and worker representative meetings. They also do not systematically and carefully study and summarize the creative experiences of the masses and promote them. In this way, it is impossible to implement the democratic management and scientific management of enterprises. This is the fundamental reason why bureaucratic work style can be preserved and developed.

    Our task must be to eradicate bureaucracy. The way to do this is to organize production competitions, organize mass supervision and criticism, and combine bottom-up mass criticism with top-down criticism to eradicate bureaucracy.

    The first is to organize more than 400,000 railway employees to participate in this struggle. Regardless of whether our workers and masses are aware of it or not fully aware of it, they have actually become the masters of the railways. Our responsibility lies in raising the workers and masses who are actually in the position of masters to a conscious level and giving play to their role as masters. To this end, we must seriously run management committees and worker representative meetings, listen to the opinions of the masses, and seriously promote rationalization proposals and the movement to create new records. We must attach importance to the creations from below, use great efforts to cultivate typical heroes, and launch a labor competition movement. We must organize workers and masses to study and participate in enterprise management, cultivate democratic forces, improve worker awareness, create mass criticism and supervision, and quickly implement the good suggestions and opinions of the masses to correct the shortcomings and errors in our work. Only when the broad masses of workers are awakened and love their own cause, and therefore hate bureaucracy, and dare to fight against it, can the territory of bureaucracy be reduced, and then bureaucracy can be eradicated from the root.

    The second is to organize the inspection of work. This is a regular and important task of leading organs. Many of our leaders only pay attention to holding meetings, making resolutions, making plans, and issuing orders, and stop there, without checking the implementation of actual work. With this big loophole, shortcomings and errors will continue forever. Therefore, leading cadres must get out of the pile of documents and the office rooms and go to the site to check the implementation of work; contact reality, carefully listen to the opinions of the masses at the lower level, ask about small things, and discover problems; promote the good ones and correct the bad ones; revise and supplement their own plans and orders to prevent repeating errors and shortcomings. The so-called asking about small things here must not be confused with headless pragmatists, but to find out the law of things from a series of phenomena to guide the work. Only by regularly checking work, contacting reality, contacting the masses, and asking about ordinary small things can we know our work well, discover the law of things, and expose and eradicate bureaucracy.

    Carrying out criticism and self-criticism is the most effective weapon to eliminate bureaucracy. At present, the atmosphere of criticism is not very strong in the railway work system. There is an atmosphere of peaceful coexistence. There are also some people who are brave to blame others and afraid to blame themselves. Mistakes are all made by subordinates and others. When criticizing, they are afraid that they are not severe or sharp enough in order to cover up their own sores. Therefore, the people who are often criticized "sincerely accept and resolutely do not change." Another is to leave work 108,000 miles away, and only entangle personal life details on "ideological principles", turning criticism into a means of mutual "slander", causing endless and unprincipled disputes that cannot be resolved. Obviously, these have nothing in common with the criticism we need. The criticism we need is lively, constructive, and conducive to work. Its purpose is to improve leadership, strengthen unity, improve the cultural level of millions of workers and masses, consolidate labor discipline, give play to combat power, and support workers and masses to truly become the masters of the railways. Therefore, our criticism must be serious and earnest, and broad in scope. We must jump out of the small circle of a few people, especially to open the "convenient door" of criticism to junior staff. Even if the criticism of subordinates is rough and harsh, or only one sentence out of ten is correct; but because they are experienced from actual life, they are often vivid. Our party and political organs must guide the broad masses to dare to criticize any of our leading organs and leaders. At the same time, we must also tell our leaders: it is foolish to avoid these criticisms. Aren't the series of shortcomings exposed in our work the sharpest criticisms of us? If we do not want to live peacefully with these shortcomings, then our party and political departments must be good at using the weapons of criticism and self-criticism, creating a habit of daring to criticize and being brave to accept criticism. Use worker representative meetings, management committees, rationalization proposals, the movement to create new records, the labor model movement, and all meetings to cultivate democracy within the party and among workers, promote criticism and self-criticism, "open the window to speak frankly," and give all staff the freedom of criticism. Let the broad masses and our party, political organs, leaders, and newspapers have direct contact, allowing workers and masses to make justified accusations against all shortcomings and errors, and allowing workers and masses to make resolute attacks on bureaucracy. We must measure the principles of our staff based on the attitude taken towards self-criticism. Only by making the atmosphere of criticism unimpeded can we guide the masses to enthusiastically participate in enterprise management, involve workers and masses in our cause, cultivate new cadres, increase new blood, and establish a new style. In this way, bureaucratic work style can be gradually eliminated.

　　铲除铁路系统中官僚主义作风
    滕代远
    一九四九年，我们全国铁路员工、铁道兵团指战员，和全国人民在一起英勇抢修全国铁路，对于加速全国解放事业有重大作用，我们将永远分享着人民胜利的光荣。但是，这是不是说我们的铁路已经办的很好了呢？还不是的！只要看一看今年第一季运输秩序上所暴露出来的一连串的缺点，就足以说明我们的铁路还办得不好或者不够好。对这一点如果不清醒，我们就将给人民铁道事业以严重的损失。
    毫无问题，我们一年来所得的成绩是不小的。但是，我们还有很多而且极其严重的缺点。首先，是在线路保养工作方面。虽然去年铁道部曾一再指出线路十分恶劣的情况，并进行了一次大补修和新养路法的示范；但郑州局及济南局所属徐州以南的线路情况今年仍极恶劣。郑州局实行了二百公里的新养路法，却没有一公里被认真验收过。道钉浮起，有的道钉还可用手拔起。郑州信阳工务段长，对于养路工作毫无所知。徐州以南路基翻浆、积水、下沉的情况是很严重的。枕木腐朽达百分之四○到五○。
    铁道部在三月份检查了全国道岔的号志。在被检查的一六六八五组道岔中，不合格者占百分之六七。其中太原局不合格者几乎是百分之百。
    机车车辆的情况也很不好。仅仅在一、二两个月中，其破损故障就有一二七九件。
    上述情况的存在，显然是不能够保证行车安全的。
    从车辆清查中，更可以看出我们过去工作粗糙的程度。东北人民铁道工作已有三、四年的历史，关内也有一、二年历史，竟有万辆以上未统计的车辆被清查出来。
    北方、南方各路局，在一、二月份中，列车晚点有增无减。始发正点最多只有百分之五○到七○；到达正点不足百分之五○，个别管理局竟有在百分之一○以下的。有些客车很脏，秩序很乱，旅客拥挤，有些铁路人员的服务态度也还不够好。
    全国铁路在一、二月份所发生的第一种事故，共计四、六二二件，而且发生了不少恶性的重大事故。事实证明我们在许多地方还不善于用科学的方法来办铁路。
    贪污浪费的现象，同样是十分惊人的。郑州局水塔贪污案，天津局材料被贪污，和去年东北总局材料贪污案，数目都很大。
    材料保管工作，有些地方也作得不好。有不少重要材料，没有记账或被漏报。大批材料放在露天任其生锈腐蚀，有些材料员不知道材料数目，个别材料处长不知道有多少仓库。
    这样严重的问题为什么还未引起大家的警惕和重视呢？就是因为在铁路工作系统中有些干部思想认识上有偏差。
    有人认为我们的铁路已经办得不错了，至少要比国民党时期为好，因此就喜欢擎功不擎过，报喜不报忧，麻痹自己，失去前进的朝气。的确，人民铁路比起国民党反动政府所办的铁路是好了一点。但是我们只要求好这一点吗？显然，没有任何根据可以使我们满足于现状。
    有人认为这些小事是不可免的，何必如此计较呢？但是，就一件事来看可能是小事，无数件的小事积累起来，就成了大事。正因为我们有若干人，大而无当，不管小事，就在铁路上造成无数漏洞，使人民的血汗和小米，受到许多不应有的损失。
    有人认为设备不好，材料缺乏，要求又高，有什么办法呢？的确，设备不好也不可能很快的好起来，材料不够也不可能很快的够用，这是在新中国建设中短期内还不能完全解决的问题。而人民的需要，又非逐步提高不可，这的确是一件难办的事。但问题还不在于难办，而在于我们能够办到的，办了没有？我们是否已经尽力之所能去改善装备？例如天津局不合格的道岔，其中百分之五一，只要一举手一投足之劳就可以改正的；色灯可以擦亮一些保持颜色鲜明；号志位置不当，只要移动一下就可以使用；好枕木上浮起的道钉，几锤就可以打下去；螺丝可以拧紧；石碴可以捣固；轨条可以整正；列车可以按运行表指挥调度；客车站场可以打扫干净；对旅客货主的服务可以更勤恳周到些。难道说这些事情没有办好，都因为设备不好，材料不足吗？显而易见不能归咎于设备与材料。何况我们还有些材料，冻结起来未被动用呢？如此说来，人民的要求并不太高，而是努力还不够。
    也有人说：我是外行，因此事情没办好。但是，如果是外行，就应该更努力、更虚心学习。毛主席指示我们要在半年、一年、两三年内学会本行业务。东北人民铁路已有近四年的历史，关内也有一年多的历史；有一切必要的设备，有成千成万的工人，有中苏专家和我们在一起，如果肯学习，至少有些基本知识是应该学会了吧？道钉浮起、螺丝松动、石碴埋没、灯光失明、机车漏汽、列车误点有碍行车安全和运输秩序等一般常识，难道还有长期学不会的吗？一切技术都是劳动创造出来的，只要肯学，任何人都有可能通晓自己的业务。
    因此，问题还是在于官僚主义作风的存在。在铁道工作系统中，和在其他工作系统中一样，只要我们稍为留心一点，就会碰到一些昏昏沉沉的腐朽分子，仍然盘据在领导岗位上。他们是饱食终日无所用心，抱着得过且过的工作态度，遇事怕负责任，怕得罪人。他们的拿手好戏，是玩弄文牍，逢迎上级。一件公文，局长批“核办”；处长批“遵办”；科长批“照办”。上海局因为一台电话机，来文复文在机关里旅行了一百七十二天，问题仍未解决。整天催报告催表报，来了堆在桌子上成为负担。郑州局一九四九年一百六十多件工程中，只有百分之二强作了报销。其余都因为你来我去，成了一笔糊涂帐。对待上级是必恭必敬，嘴上一套心里一套。他们只要自由自在的生活下去，就感到心满意足。
    还有一些是不用脑筋的思想懒汉。他们善于招架从四面八方逼上来的琐碎事务，辛辛苦苦，废寝忘食，来一件办一件，工作没有重心，不加考虑，喜欢包揽一切，发号施令，以为这样就是领导。郑州局工务处长章奋同志说：“我一天忙到深夜两三点钟才睡觉，但很少了解工作情况和存在的问题，以致水塔贪污案发生几个月之后，我还不知道”。把有限的精力浪费掉了，就没有工夫去思考与钻研问题，自然就会对腐败事物失去警觉，对新鲜事物失去敏感。他们是官僚主义的得力助手，用忙忙碌碌的形式来支持官僚主义。
    还有一些同志，喜欢空谈方针、原则、计划、决议，讲些空洞的大道理，和实际工作毫不沾边。决定之前既不考虑与实际情况是否相符；宣布之后，也不检查执行情况究竟如何；以为讲了方针原则，作了计划决定，领导责任就算已经全部尽到了，剩下来的只是一些小事情，是下级干的事。高喊消灭事故运动，正点运动，但并不去修整道岔号志，打固道钉，拧紧螺丝，捣固石碴，修好机车，检查运行表。因此左一个方针，右一个计划，一个决议又一个决议，一个运动又一个运动，而事情还是依然如故。一连串的决议计划落了空，还是找不出教训来。他们以为说空话似乎比做实际工作更容易些，这是一批诚诚恳恳的空谈家，在工作的效果上，他们和腐朽的官僚主义没有任何不同的地方。
    上述各种官僚主义不同之点是：旧官僚所表现的官僚主义，很容易被人看见，容易引起群众反对；而那些辛辛苦苦，自以为无功劳也有苦劳，或用政治口号来掩饰自己官僚主义的分子，这种官僚主义，不但是容易迷惑人，而且多数是处在有权力的地位，因此危害性也就更大。
    这些官僚主义作风共同之点，就是脱离实际、脱离群众。愈是遇到具体工作，愈是无人负责。我们若干负责人，不知道本单位有多少人、多少机器、多少工具、多少材料；也不知道今天做什么，明天应做什么。对于情况是一团漆黑，根本不了解工人群众的思想情绪；对于工人群众的创造，和崭新纪录，则熟视无睹，不去扶植，甚而吹毛求疵，加以压制，认为那是小人物小事情，不足挂齿。工人群众解放以来出现了不少英雄人物，创造了很多奇迹，但多数都被官僚主义者埋没下去。就是已经起来的英雄，也是任其自流，不去扶植培养，发挥他们的带头作用。因此民主管理，合理化建议，和毛泽东号机车运动，始终没有很好地开展起来。反之阳奉阴违，贪污腐化，瞒上不瞒下，闹派别，不负责任，破坏劳动纪律等恶劣行为，在某些管理局和分局之中，是习以为常，不以为怪的现象。郑州局在一九四九年下半年（七至十二月）发生过第一种事故一○○六件，列车每天脱线，甚致一天几次脱线，以及一列车在一个站内连续三次脱线，都没有给以严厉的处分。一、二两月重大事故，都是因为违犯规章破坏劳动纪律发生的，这就是官僚主义作风在铁路上所造成的恶果。
    为什么官僚主义作风，在铁路上如此严重，而且长期存在呢？因为当我们接收了敌伪反动派所遗留下来的铁路及其全部装备，同时也接受了敌伪反动派所遗留下来的官僚主义作风，在恢复铁路当中，还没有来得及有系统的对它展开斗争。依靠工人的方针，还没有普遍贯彻下去，工人群众没有完全被发动起来，民主管理没有完全实现。这就给官僚主义者保留了阵地。加上批评和自我批评这一武器，没有普遍的被我们的党和政治部门的干部掌握与运用起来，就使党和政治工作软弱无力，不能抵御官僚主义的进攻。
    必须指出：一直到现在，还有不少的负责干部，对于依靠工人群众恢复和发展生产的方针，是模糊的。因而不愿认真地去组织管理委员会和工人代表会。也不会有系统地、细致地去研究与总结群众的创造经验加以推广。这样就不可能实行企业的民主化管理和科学管理。这就是官僚主义作风能够保存和发展的根本原因。
    我们的任务必须是铲除官僚主义。办法就是组织生产竞赛，组织群众的监督和批评，把自下而上的群众性的批评，和自上而下的批评结合起来，以铲除官僚主义。
    首先是要组织四十多万铁路员工来参加这一斗争。不管我们的工人群众意识到或者还没有完全意识到，但他们实际上已经成了铁路的主人翁。我们的责任就在于把实际处在主人翁地位的工人群众提到自觉的水平上，发挥其主人翁的作用。为此就要认真办好管理委员会和工人代表会，听取群众的意见，认真推动合理化建议和创造新纪录运动。要重视下边的创造，用大力培养典型英雄，开展劳动竞赛运动。要组织工人群众，学习与参加企业管理，培植民主力量，提高工人觉悟，造成群众性的批评和监督，并且把群众好的建议和意见，迅速实行起来，以改正我们在工作中的缺点和错误。只有广大工人群众觉悟提高，热爱自己的事业，因而痛恨官僚主义，并且敢于向之作斗争的时候，才能缩小官僚主义的地盘，并进而从根本上铲除官僚主义。
    其次是组织对于工作的检查。这是领导机关经常的重要工作。我们有不少领导者，只注意开会、作决议、定计划、下命令，到此为止，不去检查实际工作的执行情形。有了这个大漏洞，缺点错误就将永远继续下去。因此，领导干部，就必须从公文堆和公事房里钻出来，到现场去检查工作执行的情形；接触实际，仔细倾听下层群众意见，过问小事，发现问题；好的加以提倡，坏的给以纠正；修正和补充自己的计划和命令，防止重复错误和缺点。这里所谓过问小事，绝不能与无头脑事务主义者混为一谈，乃是从一连串的现象中找出事物的规律，以指导工作。只有经常检查工作，接触实际，联系群众，过问平常小事，才能对自己的工作了如指掌，发现事物规律，暴露与铲除官僚主义。
    展开批评与自我批评，是消灭官僚主义最有效的武器。目前在铁路工作系统中批评的空气也很不浓厚。有一种是和平相处的气氛存在着。也有一种人是勇于责人，怯于责己，有错处都是下边的、别人的，批评起来唯恐不严厉不尖刻，以便掩盖自己的疮包，因此就使经常受批评者“诚恳接受，坚决不改”。另一种是离开工作十万八千里，专把个人生活小节提到“思想原则”上纠缠不清，把批评变成互相“中伤”的手段，闹着永远不能解决的无原则的纠纷。很明显的，这些和我们所需要的批评毫无共同之点。我们所需要的批评，乃是生动的、有建设性的、有利于工作的批评。其目的是为了改善领导，加强团结，提高千百万工人群众的文化程度，巩固劳动纪律，发挥战斗力量，扶持工人群众真正成为铁路的主人。因此我们的批评必须是严肃认真的，范围广大的，要跳出几个人的小圈子，特别是要给下级工作人员，大开批评的“方便之门”。下级的批评，即便是粗暴刺耳的，或者十句话只有一句话是对的；但是因为他们是从实际生活中体验出来的，往往是生动的。我们的党和政治机关必须引导广大群众，敢于批评我们任何领导机关和领导者。同时也要告诉我们的领导者：回避这些批评是愚蠢的。我们在工作上所暴露出来的一连串的缺点，还不是对我们最尖锐的批评吗？如果我们不想和这些缺点和平共居，那么，我们党和政治部门就必须善于运用批评与自我批评的武器，造成一种敢于批评和勇于接受批评的习惯。运用工人代表会、管理委员会、合理化建议、创造新纪录运动、劳模运动和一切会议，培植党内和工人中的民主，发扬批评和自我批评，“打开窗子说亮话”，给一切工作人员以批评的自由。让广大群众和我们的党、政治机关、领导者和报纸发生直接的联系，允许工人群众对于一切缺点与错误作正当的指责，允许工人群众对官僚主义作坚决的进攻。要根据对于自我批评所采取的态度，来测量我们工作人员的原则性。使批评的空气，通行无阻，才能引导群众热心参加企业管理，把工人群众卷到我们事业中来，培养新干部，增加新血液，建立一种新的作风。这样就可以逐渐地消灭官僚主义作风。
