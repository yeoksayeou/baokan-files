　　Several Opinions on Promoting the Production Experience of the Ma Hengchang Team
    Northeast Daily

    Many factories in the Northeast are currently studying and promoting the advanced production experience of the Ma Hengchang Team. At the Fifth Machinery Factory, where the Ma Hengchang Team was nurtured, the learning movement is proceeding even more enthusiastically and has already yielded considerable experience. Now, we will introduce these experiences from the factory in a summarized manner.

    First, the promotion of the advanced production experience of the Ma Hengchang Team requires the cooperation of the Party, the administration, and the trade union. The promotion work should first be under the control and leadership of the factory's Party organization and then implemented by the trade union. The factory administration must also closely cooperate and provide maximum convenience for the development of the movement. For example, when workers at the Fifth Machinery Factory raised the difficulty that "there is no place to heat food at noon in the factory, so we cannot hold technical research meetings," the administration bought kettles and repaired stoves for heating food to solve the problem of heating food at noon. It is also incorrect to simply think, "This is a mass movement and should be the concern of the trade union."

    Second, one of the most prominent characteristics of the Ma Hengchang Team is that it completes and exceeds production tasks while ensuring product quality. Therefore, learning from the advanced production experience of the Ma Hengchang Team is a powerful method for ensuring the completion of production tasks. However, some lower-level leading cadres in certain factories often regard the two as unrelated. They put aside the promotion of the advanced production experience of the Ma Hengchang Team, reasoning that "we are currently busy with production tasks." This is an erroneous idea that urgently needs to be corrected.

    Third, in order to smoothly promote the experience of the Ma Hengchang Team, it is necessary to break the complacency and conservatism that exists among some employees. After some factories introduced the experience of the Ma Hengchang Team, some people thought, "The Ma Hengchang Team is nothing special; our team also has these experiences, but we haven't publicized them," or "The Ma Hengchang Team is a lathe team; it's not applicable to us fitters." This is a backward idea of resisting the advanced. To break this obstruction and resistance, we can only carry out persuasive education ideologically. In addition, we should also encourage bold innovation, promptly discover new methods from various teams, and continuously enrich and improve the experience of the Ma Hengchang Team.

    Fourth, the advanced production experience of the Ma Hengchang Team should be promoted with a focus. The advanced production experience of the Ma Hengchang Team is very rich, but the most important aspect is that they have created many methods to consistently maintain the quality of products and improve their quantity. This should be the focus of promotion and learning in the current situation where product quality is not high in various factories. The Ma Hengchang Team's experience in production responsibility system and educating apprentices should also be promoted. Various factories have different production situations and different problems. Therefore, we should select different focuses according to the specific situation and gradually promote them, rather than generalizing.

    Fifth, pay attention to cultivating typical examples to lead by demonstration. The advanced production experience of the Ma Hengchang Team has been summarized and spread. Unfortunately, the specific typical example no longer exists (the original ten members of the Ma Hengchang Team have been transferred one after another, and only two remain in the original group. The personnel changes are too fast and too large, so the new group has not been fully cultivated). As a result, some teams have become complacent because of their individual advantages, such as saying, "We get more over-award than the Ma Hengchang Team (referring to the current one)." Therefore, we must pay attention to cultivating typical examples to play a leading and exemplary role, and help them continuously develop and improve, allocate new forces step by step, and not disperse them too early.

    Sixth, combine with technical personnel. In improving technology and ensuring quality, the Ma Hengchang Team adopted methods such as holding technical research meetings at noon, checking the first piece of work, and three-person mutual aid groups to bring into play the wisdom of the workers and their years of production experience, solving many problems that occurred in production, ensuring quality, and also improving the workers' production technology. The implementation of the "check the first piece of work" method also played a very important role, that is, in the past, technical personnel sat in the office, and workers only checked after a batch of work was sent up; now it has changed to going to the site to check. This is an important step in combining technical personnel with workers. In the past, technical personnel were reluctant to go to the site to check, thinking that this was a matter of opposition to the workers; after the implementation of the new method, the workers avoided a large number of defective products because they checked the first piece of work, and they were very welcome. Therefore, the erroneous thinking of these technical personnel has been greatly changed, and the unity between technical personnel and workers has been enhanced.

    Seventh, when promoting the advanced production experience of the Ma Hengchang Team, we should adhere to the spirit of promoting one's strengths and encouraging small progress, and promptly give praise or rewards to those who have made achievements in learning and have new creations to encourage the mood of striving for progress. Do not feel that it is not worth mentioning and ignore the fact that they have taken a step forward simply because they are not as good as the Ma Hengchang Team at present. Timely and appropriate praise and encouragement are effective ways to promote the advanced production experience of the Ma Hengchang Team.

    The movement to promote the advanced production experience of the Ma Hengchang Team has been launched in many factories in the Northeast. But this is by no means a shock movement; it should be carried out step by step and persisted in.

### 关于推广马恒昌小组生产经验的几点意见

　　关于推广马恒昌小组生产经验的几点意见
    东北日报
    东北不少工厂，正在学习和推广马恒昌小组的先进生产经验。在培养马恒昌小组的第五机械厂，学习运动进行的更加热烈，并已获得不少经验。现在，把该厂的这些经验概括地加以介绍。
    第一、推广马恒昌小组先进生产经验，须党、行政、工会配合着去做。推广工作首先是要在工厂党组织的掌握和领导下，由工会去实现。工厂行政也必须密切配合，给运动发展以最大便利。如第五机械厂工人提出“因工厂里中午没地方热饭，不能开技术研究会”的困难，行政就给买水壶并修置热饭用的锅灶，解决中午热饭问题。如果单纯认为：“这是群众运动，应该是工会的事”，也是不对的。
    第二、马恒昌小组最突出的特点之一，是在保证产品质量的条件下，完成和超过生产任务。因此，学习马恒昌小组先进生产经验，是保证完成生产任务的有力方法。但有某些工厂的下层领导干部，往往把两者当成互不相关的两件事。他们把推广马恒昌小组先进生产经验这件事放在一边，理由是“现在忙于生产任务”，这是亟应纠正的错误思想。
    第三、为了顺利推广马恒昌小组的经验，必须打破某些职工中存在的自满和保守思想。有些工厂介绍了马恒昌小组的经验后，有的人认为：“马恒昌小组没什么了不起，我们小组也有这些经验，就是没宣传出去”，“马恒昌小组是车工，对我们钳工不能适用”。这是一种落后抗拒先进的思想。要打破这种阻挠、抗拒，只有从思想上进行说服教育。另外还应该提倡大胆创造，及时发现各小组的新的方法，不断丰富和提高马恒昌小组的经验。
    第四、应该有重点地推广马恒昌小组先进生产经验。马恒昌小组的先进生产经验是很丰富的，但其中最重要的一方面是以他们创造了许多办法，经常保持了产品的质量并提高了数量。这在目前各厂产品质量不高的情况下，应该作为推广和学习的重点。马恒昌小组在生产负责制，教育徒工方面的经验，也是要推广的。各厂存在着不同的生产情况和各种不同的问题，因此，应该根据具体情况，选择不同重点，逐步推广，而不能一般化。
    第五、注意培养典型，以带头示范。马恒昌小组的先进生产经验已被总结起来，传播开了。可惜的是，具体典型已不存在（马恒昌小组原来的十个人，已相继调动，现留原组的仅有两人，人员变动太快，太大，使新组还没有完全培养好）。于是，有些小组因为自己的个别优点而骄傲自满起来，如说：“我们得超奖的比马恒昌小组（指现在的）还多。”因此，必须注意培养典型，起带头示范作用，并帮助其不断地发展和提高，有步骤地调配新的力量，不要过早分散。
    第六、和技术人员相结合。在提高技术保证质量方面，马恒昌小组采取了中午开技术研究会、先检查头一个活、三人互助小组等办法，将工人的智慧和多年的生产经验发挥出来，解决了生产当中所发生的许多问题，保证了质量，同时也提高了工人的生产技术。实行“先检查头一个活”的办法，还起了一个很重要的作用，就是过去技术人员坐在办公室，工人做完一批活，送上来才检查；现在则变为到现场去检查。这是使技术人员和工人相结合的一个重要步骤。以前技术人员不愿到现场去检查，认为这是和工人对立的事情；实行新办法后，工人因先检查头一个活，避免了大批废品，非常欢迎。因而大大转变了这些技术人员的错误思想，增进了技术人员与工人间的团结。
    第七、在推广马恒昌小组先进生产经验时，应本着发扬一技之长，鼓励微小进步的精神，对于学习有成绩、有新创造的人，及时给以表扬或奖励，以鼓舞上进的情绪，不要因为目前还不及马恒昌小组，而感到无足为奇，忽视其已前进一步的事实。及时的适当的表扬和鼓励，正是促进推广马恒昌小组先进生产经验的有效办法。
    马恒昌小组先进生产经验的推广运动，已在东北不少工厂展开。但这决不是一个突击运动，应该有步骤地加以开展，并坚持下去。
