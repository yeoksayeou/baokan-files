　　Youth Should Master Skills and Grasp Science and Technology
    ——Welcoming the May Fourth Youth Day

    The May Fourth Movement in China in 1919 was the beginning of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution. After thirty-one years, the Chinese New Democratic Revolution has basically achieved victory.

    In the May Fourth Movement, Chinese youth were the first to raise the banner against imperialism and the traitorous government of the Northern Warlord clique. Since the May Fourth Movement, Chinese youth and the Chinese people have consistently fought to overthrow the rule of imperialism and feudalism in China. Now, the goal of this struggle has basically been achieved. The People's Republic of China has been founded, and China has entered a completely new historical era.

    For the thirty-one years since the May Fourth Movement, we have been destroying an old society. Now, in this new era, we must build a new society and eliminate the poverty and backwardness left behind by imperialism and feudalism. Against enemies like imperialism and feudalism, we have used guns, cannons, demonstrations, and various other methods to fight them. But to eliminate poverty and backwardness, we must use new weapons. That is: the ability to build in all areas. That is: the need to master skills and grasp science and technology.

    The new era has opened up infinitely broad paths for Chinese youth and the Chinese people. The scope of revolutionary work has expanded compared to the past, and the tasks are even more arduous than before. We need to deepen our research into every line of work and improve it step by step, just as Kalinin said: "To grasp the correct line of Marxism, you must become highly skilled experts in your own field of work."

    We need experts in our construction work. Heroes who loyally serve the people's cause should be respected, not despised. If we despise experts, or confuse experts with individual heroism, then are we satisfied with generalists who can do everything but are proficient in nothing? How can our country carry out construction? We should cultivate countless experts to do a good job in national construction.

    The slogan of mastering skills applies to young people in various work positions. Every kind of work can be explored, and experts can emerge. As the saying goes, "Every profession produces its master." Currently, some young members of the Communist Youth League among primary school teachers in Northeast China are firmly requesting to go to factories and schools. They believe that other professions can be studied in depth, but the profession of primary school teacher has no value in studying. Many young people dispatched from Beijing and Tianjin to work in rural areas of Hebei Province want to return to the cities. They feel that they cannot learn in the countryside and request to study policies in high-level institutions, while young people working in high-level institutions say they want to have more contact with reality and go to factories and rural areas for training. In fact, these ideas are all incorrect. We believe that in every position in the cause of New Democratic construction, we can learn skills and train ourselves. Some young people like to say that this job is not suitable for me and I am not interested in it. You must know that for a young person, any job is new. In the great cause of building a new China, no matter what the job, as long as you can delve into that job, you will come into contact with new things and discover new horizons. For example, being a primary school teacher, doing a good job in primary school education, and teaching primary school students well, there are many principles in this that require us to study in depth. Many people have seen the Soviet film "The Village Teacher," which shows what a great and heroic undertaking a primary school teacher is. Lenin's wife, Krupskaya, devoted her life to the study of children's education and made brilliant achievements in Soviet new education. Young people in any work position should settle down to work, do their job well, cultivate their interest in their work, and master their skills.

    In mastering various skills, we must especially emphasize studying science well and mastering technology. Because science and technology are indispensable for transforming the old and backward China into a New Democratic industrialized China. As Lenin said in 1920: "The task before you is to revive the whole country economically, to transform and restore agriculture and industry on the basis of modern science and technology, and on the basis of electrical modern technology." Science and technology are even more important for young students and young workers. Among young students, we must study science well. Currently, in general schools, students take learning their lessons well as their main task, and young league members generally achieve excellent results in their lessons. This is a very good phenomenon. However, there are still a few who only talk about political study and not about science study, and cannot learn science. Yes, young people must strengthen their political study and have a revolutionary outlook on life, so that they have a foundation for learning science and technology, but if you only understand politics and do not make an effort to study science, you will not master science and technology. Among young workers, we must master technology well. This has already begun to show outstanding performance among some young workers and young league members, such as the league member Zhao Guoyou, who increased the efficiency of the original estimated work by five times and created a new production record, and the female train driver Tian Guiying in Dalian, etc. This shows that young workers mastering science and technology has made a great contribution to the cause of national construction. But there are also some young workers who have great enthusiasm for production and automatically work day and night, which is also very good. But because they are not good at mastering technology, they cannot continue to do so for a long time, and they become detached from the masses, and even damage their health. This has also become a shortcoming. Therefore, we must greatly promote the technical learning of young workers, sign apprenticeship contracts, and run youth spare-time technical lectures. We not only want to master the technical experience of older workers, but also want to start from our generation of young workers to enter the gate of science, so that we gradually become new technical workers with scientific knowledge who can use both their hands and their brains.

    For the Youth League, the Youth League is the party's reserve force and assistant in all aspects of work. If league members are not good at mastering skills and science and technology, how can they take on this important task? Some people say: I am now a member of the Youth League, and I will be a member of the Communist Party in the future. My future has been determined. Why should I consider the future of development or career issues? Yes, it is very necessary to determine this revolutionary aspiration. However, as a league member, you still need to recognize which aspect of talent you will cultivate yourself into. That is to say, you must formulate your own life process, determine your position in the cause of New Democratic construction, and master the career you have chosen for your life. The leading organs of the Youth League must, under the leadership of the Party, educate young people to learn all the skills of production and combat, so that they can be transported to various positions.

    Young people! We do not need people who are superficial, who only have a smattering of knowledge, who can say a few words about everything, but who have no expertise in any field. Such people will not play any role in our lives, either now or in the future. Only those who are good at working systematically and who are proficient in a certain specialized business can play an active role in national life.

    Young people, to be proficient in business and master science and technology, you must study hard. There are difficulties in learning. Sometimes there is no teacher, and you can only rely on your own research. In terms of learning attitude, if you are ambitious and give up halfway, you will not learn well. Therefore, you must study humbly, practically, and tirelessly. Only in this way can you gradually become a skilled worker as you grow older and accumulate knowledge. Our youth's vigorous spirit should be applied to this aspect.

    Young people! Today we commemorate the 31st anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, and it is also the anniversary of the founding of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. We hope that this generation of young people and Youth League members will strengthen their studies, master their skills, and grasp science and technology. From this generation of young people, we will cultivate skilled sailors, pilots, railway workers, gunners, tank crewmen, filers, lathe operators, various engineers, architects, artists, teachers, doctors, journalists, government workers, financial experts, political workers, outstanding leaders of mass movements, etc., to serve the great Chinese people and thoroughly complete Mao Zedong's cause.

### 青年要精通业务掌握科学技术——迎五四青年节

　　青年要精通业务掌握科学技术
    ——迎五四青年节
    一九一九年中国的五四运动，是中国新民主主义革命的开端，经过三十一年，到现在，中国新民主主义革命已经在基本上取得了胜利。
    在五四运动中，中国青年首先高举起反对帝国主义和北洋封建军阀卖国政府的大旗；从五四运动以来，中国青年和中国人民一贯地为推翻帝国主义和封建主义在中国的统治而奋斗。现在这个奋斗的目标基本上已经实现，中华人民共和国已经成立，中国已经进入一个完全新的历史时代。
    五四以来的三十一年，我们是破坏一个旧社会。现在这个新的时代，则是要建设一个新社会，要消灭帝国主义封建主义所遗留下来的贫穷和落后。对于帝国主义封建主义这些敌人，我们使用过枪、炮和游行示威等各种办法去和它们斗争，但要消灭贫穷落后，我们就不能不使用新的武器。那就是：各方面建设的本领。那就是：要精通业务，掌握科学技术才行。
    新的时代为中国青年与中国人民开辟了无限宽广的道路。革命工作的范围比以前扩大，任务比起以前更加繁重。需要我们对每一行工作加深钻研，把它提高一步，正如加里宁所说：“要把握马克思主义的正确路线，那你们就应当成为自己工作部门中很高明的专家。”
    我们在建设工作中是需要专家的。忠诚服务于人民事业的英雄，应该受到尊敬，而不应该受到轻视。如果对专家轻视，或者把专家和个人英雄主义混为一谈，那么，难道我们便满足于什么都能做什么都不精的一般人才吗？那我们国家怎能进行建设呢？我们正应该培养无数的专家，来搞好国家的建设。
    精通业务这一口号，对于各种工作岗位上的青年，都是适用的。每一种业务，都能钻出道理，都能产生专家，俗话叫做“行行出状元”。目前东北有些地方的小学教员中的青年团员，坚决要求到工厂、学校去。他们认为别的业务可以钻研，小学教员的业务则没有钻研的价值。京津等地派到河北省农村中去工作的青年，有许多要求回到城市来，他们觉得在农村里不能学习，要求到高级机关学习政策，而在高级机关里工作的青年，又有些说要多接触实际，到工厂、农村里去锻炼。其实，这些想法都是不对的。我们认为在新民主主义建设事业的每一岗位上，都能学到本领，锻炼自己。有些青年人爱说这工作对我不适合，没有兴趣，要知道对于一个青年来说，任何工作都是新的。在建设新中国的伟大事业中，不管什么工作，只要能够深入到那工作里面去，就会接触到新的事物，发现新的天地。譬如当一个小学教员，把小学教育搞好，教好小学生，这里面就有很多的道理，需要我们钻研。许多人看过苏联电影《万世师表》，它就说明小学教师是何等伟大的英雄事业。列宁夫人克鲁普斯卡雅就是毕生研究儿童教育的，在苏联新教育上有着辉煌的成就。在任何工作岗位上的青年，都应该安心工作，把工作做好，在工作中培植自己的兴趣，精通自己的业务。
    在精通各种业务中，我们特别要着重提到好好的学习科学，掌握技术。因为，科学和技术，是把旧的落后的中国，变为一个新民主主义的工业化的中国所不可缺少的东西。正如列宁在一九二○年所说：“你们面前的任务就是要在经济上复兴全国，要在基于现代科学和技术、基于电气的现代技术基础上改造和恢复农业和工业。”科学和技术对于青年学生和青年工人更加重要。在青年学生中，要好好学习科学。目前一般学校，学生都以学好功课为主要任务，青年团员一般地在功课上得到优良的成绩。这是很好的现象。但是仍然有少数只谈政治学习不谈科学学习，对科学学不进的情形。是的，青年人必须加强政治学习，使自己具有革命的人生观，这样学习科学技术才有基础，但只懂政治，不努力去钻研科学，你就不会掌握科学技术的。在青年工人中，要好好掌握技术。这在一些青年工人和青年团员中，已经开始有了卓越的表现，如提高原估工的五倍效率创造出生产新纪录的团员赵国有，如大连火车女司机田桂英等。这说明青年工人掌握科学技术，对于国家建设事业，有了很大的贡献。但还有一些青年工人，他们有很高的生产热忱，自动地日以继夜地作工，这也是很好的。但因为不善于掌握技术，结果不能持久地做下去，并且脱离群众，甚至损害了自己健康。这也就成了缺点。因此，我们还要大大地提倡青年工人技术学习，订师徒合同，开办青工业余技术讲座。我们不只要把老年工人的技术经验掌握到手，而且要从我们这一代青年工人开始，走进科学的大门，使我们逐渐成为既能用手又能用脑的具有科学知识的新的技术劳动者。
    对于青年团来说，青年团是党在各方面的工作的后备军和助手。如果团员不善于掌握业务和科学技术，怎样能担负起这一重大任务呢？有人说：我现在是青年团员，将来会是共产党员，我的前途已经确定，还要考虑什么发展前途，什么事业问题呢？是的，确定了这个革命的志向，这是很必要的，但是，作为一个团员仍然需要认清，将培养自己成为那一方面的人才。这就是说，必须拟定自己的生活的进程，确定自己在新民主主义建设事业中的岗位，精通自己所选定的生平事业，青年团的领导机关，必须在党的领导下教育青年们学会生产与战斗的全副本领，才能把他们输送到各种岗位上去。
    青年们！我们不需要浮光掠影、一知半解、门门都能说两句，而都没有一门专长的人，这样的人，在我国生活中的现在和将来，都不会起什么作用的。只有善于有系统地工作和通晓一定专门业务的人，才能在国家生活中，起着应有的积极的作用。
    青年们，要能精通业务、掌握科学技术，必须努力学习。在学习中是有困难的，有时候没有教师，只能依靠自己钻研。而在学习态度上，如果好高鹜远，一曝十寒，那也是学不好的。因此，必须虚心地、踏实地、毫不懈怠地学习，只有这样，才能使自己随着年龄的增长，知识的积累，而慢慢地成为熟练的工作者。我们青年的蓬勃的朝气，应当运用到这方面来。
    青年们！今天纪念五四运动三十一周年，同时又是中国新民主主义青年团成立周年纪念。我们希望这一代青年和青年团员，加强学习，精通业务，掌握科学技术。从这一代青年中，培养出高明的海员、飞机师、铁路员工、炮手、坦克手、锉匠、旋匠、各种工程师、建筑家、艺术家、教师、医生、记者、政权工作者、财经专家、政治工作人员、群众运动的优秀领导者等，去为伟大的中国人民服务，彻底地完成毛泽东的事业。
