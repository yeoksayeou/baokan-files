Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Today in Beijing, 90,000 organized young men and women held a grand parade to celebrate the first "May Fourth" Youth Day after the founding of the People's Republic of China. Liu Shaoqi, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government, Zhu De, Vice Chairman, Li Jishen, Vice Chairman, Zhang Lan, Vice Chairman, and Premier Zhou Enlai, Mayor of Beijing Nie Rongzhen, Feng Wenbin, Secretary of the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, Xie Bangding, Chairman of the All-China Student Federation, and leaders of various parties, departments of the Central People's Government, and people's organizations, all attended the review of the parade.
    The Soviet youth delegation and embassy staff from various countries were also invited to attend the ceremony.
    At about 1:00 PM, the 90,000-strong contingent gathered in Dongdan Square. At 2:30 PM, the parade began to move towards Tiananmen Square. The band played the national anthem and the World Democratic Youth Anthem. The vanguard of the parade was the honor guard: at the front were the newly appeared flags of the New Democratic Youth League and the Young Pioneers, as well as 42 large red flags; followed by two huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Stalin, and behind them were portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Dimitrov, as well as portraits of Thorez, Togliatti, Pieck, Bierut, Gottwald, Rákosi, Gheorghiu-Dej, Chervenkov, Choibalsan, Kim Il-sung, Ho Chi Minh, and Hoxha.
    Following the honor guard were the teams from the Central Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League and the Central Youth League School, followed by thousands of Young Pioneers in white shirts and red scarves. As they passed Tiananmen Square, they released 54 peace doves and sent 13 members to the rostrum to present flowers to Vice Chairman Liu and others.
    After the Young Pioneers, the Chinese Youth Art Theater, the Central Academy of Drama, and other performing arts groups formed a costumed Yangko team and waist drum team of more than 500 people, parading and performing simultaneously. The five colors were dazzling and extremely spectacular. Behind the performing arts groups with their deafening drums and gongs, were thousands of young soldiers, who passed through Tiananmen Square with strict formations and uniform steps. Next came a mighty contingent of thousands of young workers, led by about 200 red flags, followed by more than 10,000 university students and more than 30,000 middle school students, more than 10,000 young staff members from government agencies, and more than 10,000 young people from various districts of Beijing. They held high slogans such as "Long Live Chairman Mao," "Defend World Peace," "Down with Imperialism," and "Build a New China," waving thousands of hands and cheering towards the reviewing stand: "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live the Chinese Communist Party!" "Long Live the Central People's Government!". Many units changed formations to form the words "May Fourth" and "Long Live Chairman Mao." Students from the Hui Nationality Academy formed the two large characters "Hui" and "Min" (Hui Nationality). Countless outstanding waist drum teams and Yangko teams danced energetically.
    On the reviewing stand, enthusiastic applause greeted each youth team. Vice Chairman Liu repeatedly shouted slogans such as "Celebrate Youth Day!" "Carry forward the May Fourth tradition!" "Long live the youth!" "Long live the workers!" "Long live the students!" and waved frequently to the cheering youth.
    The parade continued for four and a half hours, ending at 7:00 PM. After the parade, tens of thousands of young people held a grand garden party in Zhongshan Park in the evening, with 92 different performances. The Soviet Youth Art Troupe also participated in the performance.

    少年儿童队过后，中国青年艺术剧院、中央戏剧学校等文工团的五百人以上的化装秧歌队和腰鼓队一边游行，一边表演。五色缤纷，极为壮观。在锣鼓喧天的文工团后面，是数千名青年战士的队伍，他们以严整的阵容和齐一的步伐通过天安门广场。接着是浩浩荡荡的以约二百面左右的红旗为前导的数千青年工人的队伍，一万多大学生和三万多中学生的队伍，一万多的机关青年工作人员和一万多北京市各区青年的队伍。他们高举着“毛主席万岁”、“保卫世界和平”、“打倒帝国主义”、“建设新中国”等标语，挥动千百只手，向检阅台欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“中央人民政府万岁！”。许多单位变换队形，组成“五四”、“毛主席万岁”等字样。回民学院的学生则排成“回”“民”两个大字。无数出色的腰鼓队、秧歌队，跳着健美的舞蹈。
    检阅台上，热烈的鼓掌迎接着每一队青年队伍。刘副主席不时地高呼：“庆祝青年节！”“发扬五四传统！”“青年们万岁！”“工人们万岁！”“同学们万岁！”等口号，向欢声雷动的青年们频频招手。
