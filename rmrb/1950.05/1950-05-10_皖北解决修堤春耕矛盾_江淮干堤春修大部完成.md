　　【Hefei Dispatch】According to the Anhui North Daily, the spring repair work on the Jiang and Huai main dikes within Anhui North has been largely completed, and the problem of conflicting schedules between spring repair and spring ploughing has been basically resolved. The spring repair work on the two major Jianghuai main dikes began between late February and early March, with approximately 350,000 civilian laborers participating (198,000 on the Jiang Dike and over 150,000 on the Huai Dike). Over the past month, thanks to the efforts of the vast number of civilian laborers and cadres, the majority of the entire project has been completed. According to reports from various special districts to the Anhui North Administrative Office, regarding the Jiang Dike, the Anqing Special District plans to complete the work by the end of April, and the Chaohu Special District reported that it had been basically completed by April 20. The Chuxian Special District (only Jiangpu County) originally planned to complete the spring repairs on the Jiang Dike by early April, but this was delayed due to the abandonment of the Huangnitian retreat and construction project, and it is estimated that it will also be completed by the end of April. Regarding the Huai Dike (including the four special districts of Fuyang, Lu'an, Suxian, and Chuxian), according to statistics at the end of March, 60 percent of the total task had been completed, totaling 2,131,100 cubic meters of earthwork. As of now, it is estimated that 80 percent will be completed, with plans to complete the whole task in early May.

　　With the completion of the majority of the spring repair tasks, the coordination of labor between spring ploughing and spring repair has been basically resolved. Around the time of Qingming Festival, when spring ploughing began and spring repair was at its most intense, the civilian laborers in each dike section were concerned about the spring ploughing work at home, which affected the timely completion of the spring repair tasks. In response, the leadership of dike repair in each special district, especially in the special districts along the river, carried out the necessary explanation and persuasion work. The political commissar of the Anqing Special District Dike Repair Headquarters first went to Huaining County to inspect and pointed out: "First, we must ensure that the Jiang Dike is repaired well in order to guarantee spring agricultural production." Subsequently, the Special District Dike Repair Headquarters issued instructions: in order not to delay the farming season and to stabilize the morale of the civilian laborers, each county could, based on the specific situation, actively mobilize mountain people and some civilian laborers with fewer working hands at home to return home for spring ploughing, but it was necessary to ensure that the spring repair tasks were roughly completed before Grain Rain. Of the 115,000 civilian laborers in the entire special district, if each county demobilized one-third, then more than 40,000 civilian laborers would return home for spring ploughing. Among the demobilized civilian laborers, the method of self-reporting and mutual evaluation by civilian labor groups was generally adopted, with one person being demobilized from a group of two or three, or one person being demobilized from two households. The civilian laborers remaining on the dike and those returning home signed contracts to ensure that "rice seedling fields are not left uncultivated, and dike repair is not delayed." After the spring repair is completed and they return home, accounts are settled, using work to offset work, with those who have done less work making up for it later or being paid wages. With the contradiction between dike repair and spring ploughing resolved, the morale of the civilian laborers stabilized, and the efficiency of dike repair work improved significantly. After Huaining County announced the scheduling of civilian laborers to be demobilized in batches, their morale soared, and the civilian laborers in Hongzhen District enthusiastically responded to the call to save national resources and donated 900 cubic meters of earthwork. Civilian laborer Ding Xingwang said: "This is great, we guarantee we won't go home until the dike is repaired!" The Suhuang section Huai Dike Civilian Laborer Brigade Headquarters in Fengyang County, in order to further stabilize the morale of the civilian laborers, specifically instructed each company to send a number of civilian laborers back to their respective districts and villages to understand the situation of plowing and planting on their behalf, and then relay this information to the civilian laborers, so as to completely dispel the families' concerns. At present, the masses in the rear are vigorously organizing mutual aid production to solve labor shortages, and the civilian laborers on the dike are working hard to accelerate the completion of the spring repair tasks.

　　皖北解决修堤春耕矛盾
    江淮干堤春修大部完成
    【合肥讯】据皖北日报消息：皖北境内江、淮干堤的春修工程已大部完成，春修与春耕在时间上互相矛盾问题获得基本解决。江淮两大干堤的春修工程开始于二月下旬至三月初旬之间，参加修堤的民工约三十五万左右（江堤十九万八千，淮堤十五万余），一个多月来，由于广大民工与干部的努力，全部工程已完成大部。据各专区向皖北行署的报告，江堤方面，安庆专区拟定于四月底完工，巢湖专区至四月二十日统计已基本完成。滁县专区（仅江浦一县）江堤春修原计划四月初旬竣工，由于黄泥滩退建工程的废弃而推迟，估计于四月底也能完成。淮堤方面（包括阜阳、六安、宿县、滁县四专区），据三月底统计，已完成总任务的百分之六十，计二百一十三万一千公方土。到目前为止，估计可能完成百分之八十。预定五月初旬全部完成。
    由于春修任务的大部完成，春耕与春修劳动力的调剂，获得了基本的解决。在清明前后，正是春耕开始与春修最紧张的时候，各堤段民工，曾为顾虑家里春耕工作，影响着春修任务的如期完成。对此，各专区尤其是沿江各专区修堤领导上，均进行了必要的解释说服工作。安庆专区修堤指挥部政委首先深入怀宁县检查，指出：“首先要保证江堤修好，才能保证春耕生产。”接着专区修堤指挥部又发出指示：为了不误农时与稳定民工情绪，各县可根据具体情况，主动动员山地民工及有用而劳力少的一部民工回家春耕，但必需使春修任务在谷雨以前大致完工。全专区民工计十一万五千人，如各县都复员三分之一，则共有四万余民工回家春耕。在复员民工中，一般采取民工小组自报互评的办法，二人或三人中复员一人，或两户中复员一人。留堤民工与回家民工互订合同，保证做到“不荒秧田，不误修堤”，待春修完成回家后算账，以工抵工，工少的以后补或算工资。解决了修堤与春耕的矛盾，民工情绪稳定，修堤工作效率显著提高。怀宁县宣布调度民工分批复员后，情绪高涨，洪镇区民工并热烈响应节省国家资财号召，献出土方九百方。民工丁兴旺说：“这样就好了，保证不修好堤不回家！”凤阳县苏黄段淮堤民工大队部，为了更进一步安定民工情绪，特指示各中队派若干民工回到本区本乡，了解代耕代种情况，然后转告民工，以彻底打消民工家庭顾虑。现各地后方群众正大力组织互助生产，以解决劳动力困难，堤上民工正为加速完成春修任务而紧张突击。
