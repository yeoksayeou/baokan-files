　　Yuanshi Cotton Sprouts Well
　　Villagers are Replanting and Weeding

[Report from this newspaper in Yuanshi] Cotton seedlings in Yuanshi County, Hebei Province, are sprouting well. Some fields with uneven growth are being replanted, and a weeding campaign is underway in all villages. After thorough preparation, the county's cotton planting work began in full swing on April 15th after a rainfall, and by the 26th, the county's cotton planting exceeded the original plan of 130,000 mu by 20,000 mu. After the planting, various areas have shifted to checking cotton fields, protecting seedlings, replanting, weeding, and preventing aphids. During the inspection, county and district cadres went to the fields in conjunction with the village production committees and technical research groups, and mobilized the masses to inspect each other. If seedlings were found to be missing, the causes were studied and replanting was mobilized. Currently, most of the cotton seedlings have emerged, and replanting is underway in a few fields with uneven emergence. For example, in Chi Village in the Third District, out of 2,830 mu of cotton fields, only eight mu (three households, accounting for 0.28%) had uneven seedlings, and replanting has been completed. In Dongbao, out of 4,679 mu of cotton fields, only ten households had 43 mu of incomplete seedlings (accounting for 0.9%). In Zhongjie, First District, out of 273 mu planted with cotton, 15.8 mu had poor seedling emergence (accounting for 5.8%), and 10 mu have been replanted, with the rest being replanted as well. The reasons for poor seedling emergence are: first, poor technique. For example, in Chi Village, some planted immediately after the rain, making the soil prone to compaction and preventing emergence; others thought the ground was wet at the time and scattered the seeds too shallowly, and they were dried by the spring wind. Second, lack of planting experience. For example, in the streets of Chengguan, because they had not planted cotton before, the cotton seeds in the wheat ridges were planted too deep, and more than half of the sprouts could not emerge. In Nan Street, out of 40 mu of cotton planted in wheat ridges, 26 mu that did not emerge were all planted too deep; the four mu planted by Aozi by ditching and scattering seeds had very even emergence because the depth was appropriate. Cui Erhe planted 1.5 mu, and because it was too deep, some sprouts could not emerge. He removed a layer of soil from each pit, and the cotton seedlings grew out. Currently, villages throughout the county are racing to plant millet, with women and children taking on the task of weeding and preventing aphids. Li Yu, a production committee member of Chi Village, promoted the importance of weeding at the meal break, and Li Qiaozi, Yuzhu, Baotai, and others all said: "That's right, aphids first grow on the grass roots. Once ants get on the cotton, the cotton will also have aphids." Li Yuzhu also mobilized more than ten people to weed. In the whole village, 300 women and 90 children participated in weeding. All the grass along the field edges, roadsides, and near the cotton fields has been cleared, and the grass has been taken back to feed pigs or make fertilizer. Women in Zhao Tong and other villages organized small mutual aid weeding groups, and on the 6th, 40 women went to the fields and weeded 320 mu of cotton fields.

### 元氏棉花发芽良好　各村群众正补种锄草

　　元氏棉花发芽良好
　　各村群众正补种锄草
    【本报元氏讯】河北省元氏县棉田发芽良好，少数生得不齐的地亩正在补种，锄草运动已在各村展开。该县种棉工作经过充分准备后，于四月十五日雨后展开全面突击抢种，截至二十六日，全县种棉即超过十三万亩的原计划二万亩。种棉结束后，各地已转入检查棉田、保苗、补苗、锄草、防蚜等工作。检查中县区干部结合村生产委员会、技术研究组下地，并发动群众互相检查，发现缺苗，即研究原因，动员补种。现绝大部分棉苗已出齐，少数出苗不齐的地亩正在补种。如三区池村二千八百三十亩棉田，苗不齐的只有八亩（三户，占千分之二点八），现已补种上。董堡四千六百七十九亩棉田，只有十户四十三亩苗不全（占千分之九）。一区中街种棉二百七十三亩，有十五亩八分苗未出好（占百分之五点八），现已补种了十亩，其余亦在补种。苗出不好的原因：第一是技术不好。如池村有的是刚下雨就种，土易凝住出不来，有的当时认为地湿，撒籽太浅，没擦好，被春风吹干。第二是种地没经验。如城关各街因为过去没点过棉，麦垅棉点种太深，生了芽有二分之一以上出不来。南街麦垅种棉四十亩，没出的二十六亩都是点种太深；鳌子挑沟撒籽种的四亩，因深浅适当出苗便很齐。崔二和点一亩半，因为太深，有芽出不来，他把每个坑起去一层土，棉苗就长出来了。目前该县各村正在抢种谷子，妇女、儿童担当起锄草防蚜工作。池村生产委员李余头晌午在饭场上宣传锄草道理，李巧子、玉柱、保泰等都说：“就是，腻虫先在根生草上生，赶蚂蚁一上棉花，棉花上也就有腻虫了”。李玉柱并动员了十多个人锄草。全村有三百妇女九十个儿童参加锄草。现已将所有棉地边道沿离棉地近的坟地草都锄净，并将草弄回喂了猪或沤了粪。赵同等村妇女组织小型互助锄草，在六号一天便有四十个妇女下地锄了三百二十亩棉地草。
