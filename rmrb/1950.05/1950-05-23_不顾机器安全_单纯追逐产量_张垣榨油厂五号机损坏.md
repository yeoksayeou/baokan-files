　　Disregarding Machine Safety, Solely Pursuing Output
     No. 5 Machine Damaged at Zhangyuan Oil Press Factory
    [This newspaper's Zhangjiakou report] A serious accident occurred at the Zhangyuan Vegetable Oil Factory on the 14th of last month. Zhao Yushan's team in the oil pressing department of the factory over-tightened the No. 5 oil press, damaging the steel shaft sleeve. The central shaft was also bent, requiring a 13-day shutdown for repairs before production could be resumed. The direct and indirect loss was 19,387 catties of millet, equivalent to one month's salary for all 80-plus employees.
    The vegetable oil factory is one of the better-managed state-owned enterprises in Zhangjiakou. After liberation, the consciousness of the factory workers increased, and last year's output increased sevenfold. In the first quarter of this year, costs were reduced by 12.88 percent, equivalent to saving 155,903 catties of millet. New records for output and product yield were created multiple times. However, the factory developed a degree of bias in the process of launching the record-breaking movement. Workers, due to repeated calls from the administrative side, tightened the machines during work to exceed others' achievements, thus neglecting the efficiency and safety of the machines. The theoretical specification for each new oil press is 10,000 catties of material pressed per day, and the factory's highest daily pressing amount reached 12,500 catties, exceeding the standard by 25 percent. In March, the administrative side stipulated an oil extraction rate of 31 percent, which actually reached 33 percent. In April, the rate was stipulated at 34 percent, and it actually reached 35.8 percent. On the day of the accident, the No. 5 machine's oil yield reached 39.73 percent, exceeding the theoretical figure by 2.73 percent. The discipline of some workers was lax. Only when the administrative负责人 inspected the workshop would they work according to the prescribed standards and operating methods, but as soon as the inspectors left, they would resume their own ways. For example, it was stipulated that two people must work to tighten the machine (one person pulls the live wheel and one person tightens the machine), but Zhao Yushan's team often only had one person doing it. The accident of the No. 5 oil press occurred under these circumstances.
    The administrative负责人 did not effectively prevent this adverse trend of disregarding machine safety and exceeding machine efficiency, leading to continuous accidents.

### 不顾机器安全·单纯追逐产量  张垣榨油厂五号机损坏

　　不顾机器安全·单纯追逐产量
     张垣榨油厂五号机损坏
    【本报张家口讯】张垣植物油厂于上月十四日发生恶性事故。该厂榨油部赵玉山班，因紧车过猛，把五号榨油机钢轴套挤坏。并把中轴挤弯，须停工修理十三天，方能恢复生产。直接间接损失小米一九三八七斤，约等于全体员工八十余人一个月的工资。
    植物油厂是张市公营企业中经营较好的一个单位。解放后，该厂职工觉悟提高，去年一年产量提高七倍。今年第一季生产中，共降低成本百分之一二点八八，等于节省小米一五五九○三斤。并创造了多次产量与产品率的新纪录。但该厂在开展创新纪录运动的过程中发生了某种程度的偏向。工人由于行政方面一再号召，在工作时都加紧紧车，使自己的成绩超过别人，因此忽视了机器的效能和安全。每台新榨油机的理论规定是每日榨料万斤，该厂每日最高榨量达一二五○○斤，即超过百分之二十五；三月份行政方面规定榨油率为百分之三十一，实际达到百分之三十三；四月份规定为百分之三十四，实际达到百分之三五点八。发生事故那天，五号机产油率达百分之三九点七三。超过理论数字百分之二点七三。部分工人纪律松懈，当行政负责人到车间检查时，才按规定的标准与操作方法工作，检查人员一走，便依然各行其是。如规定紧车必须两个人作（一个人拉活轮一个人紧车），但赵玉山班往往只一个人作。五号榨油机的事故便是在这样情况下产生的。
    行政负责人对这种不顾机器安全，超越机器效能的不良倾向，没有有效制止，致事故连续发生。
