Tangshan Trains Over 30,000 Miners in Rotation
　　5,000 Transfer to Cultural Studies

[Report from] this newspaper, Tangshan: Special correspondent Zhou Yaodong reports: Since early October of last year, the Tangshan Kailuan Coal Mine General Trade Union has adopted a large-scale, short-term, rotational training class approach to conduct systematic Marxist-Leninist education among the broad masses of miners. As of now, more than 30,000 employees (accounting for more than 60% of all employees) have participated in this study. It is estimated that within one or two months, more than 80% of employees will have completed the rotational training. Over 4,800 workers who have completed the rotational training have separately transferred to worker's spare-time schools to pursue cultural studies.

　　Explain several basic revolutionary issues in a short period to raise the consciousness of the working class.

The educational guideline for the rotational training classes is to explain several basic revolutionary issues in a short period to raise the class consciousness of the working masses, and to conduct policy education based on class consciousness. The initial education plan was to study for seven to ten days per session, briefly explaining six issues: "Labor Creates the World," "Class Struggle," "Communism and the Communist Party," "Three Enemies and Four Friends," "Labor-Capital Mutual Benefit," and "Establishing a New Labor Attitude." Later, each session was changed to half a month, combining "Three Enemies and Four Friends" into an explanation of the Chinese Communist Party's minimum program, and merging "New Labor Attitude" into "Labor-Capital Mutual Benefit." Each mine (Kailuan Coal Mine has a total of five mines) has 600 to 1,000 people participating in each session, divided into two or three shifts according to working hours. Each day consists of two hours of study. The rotational training classes are organized by the trade union's cultural and educational departments of each mine, and a sound class affairs committee (composed of the heads of each mine's trade union, military representative, CCP committee, and Youth League) has been established. Each class has a class affairs committee (composed of worker activists), which divides responsibilities under unified leadership to carry out leadership and management work. Instructors are CCP committee members from each mine and cadres with a preliminary theoretical foundation. After completing their studies, students are graded into four levels—A, B, C, and D—and awarded graduation certificates.

As a large number of workers participated in the rotational training, it has had a great impact on the working masses. The class consciousness of the workers has been raised, and a preliminary materialistic view has been established. The workers have grown closer to the Party and the trade union, consolidating the organization of the trade union, and the unity between staff and workers, and between workers, has also improved. At the same time, the workers have recognized the great significance of labor and have changed their past attitude of often despising going down the mine to work and considering labor a disgrace. A large number of activists have emerged from the masses, overcoming the phenomenon where a few activists were often in an isolated position in the past.

　　Study requirements increase with training, laying the foundation for cultural learning.

In addition, the learning requirements of employees also increase with training. In the past, workers rarely went to clubs and libraries after work, but now they are always crowded. The rotational training classes have laid a good foundation for today's cultural learning.

The mine has the following experiences in carrying out this work:

1.  Instructors should pay attention to connecting with the experiences of the masses when lecturing, striving to be simple, concise, and easy to understand, and appropriately adopting a discussion approach (first making a brief introduction, then raising questions, inspiring answers, developing debates, and finally analyzing, answering, and drawing conclusions). This approach can also solve the difficulties of uneven cultural levels among students (for example, the cultural level statistics of 1,039 trainees in the fourth session of the Linxi Mine Rotational Training Class: university accounted for 13%, middle school 15%, elementary school 36.5%, and illiteracy 25.5%) and inconsistent requirements. But to achieve this, instructors must first prepare well and humbly learn from the masses, understand the ideological status of the masses, and existing problems. At the same time, the teaching center must be clear, distinguishing between the important and the secondary, grasping the key points, focusing on the main basic issues, and avoiding repetition.

2.  Improve the learning organization and working system, and implement the mass line in the work. Some mines established class affairs committees at the beginning of running the rotational training classes, and each class also set up class affairs committees, establishing meeting, reporting, leave, attendance, and other systems to promptly reflect the situation and solve problems. Under the class affairs committee, each class established sub-teams based on trade union branches, combining the learning organization with the trade union organization, and the students elected team leaders and group leaders to promptly supervise, inspire, and lead the learning of their respective teams.

3.  Strengthen learning guidance and carefully organize discussions. Some rotational training classes have assigned employees who have been trained to the groups as backbones, serving as learning officers, and have adopted the method of "speaking out grievances from the past" in discussion or holding debates, etc., to inspire the workers' learning enthusiasm, with great results. Some rotational training classes also adopted methods such as "rising and falling charts" to promptly publicize exam results to encourage students' progress.

### 唐山轮训三万余矿工　五千人转入文化学习

　　唐山轮训三万余矿工
　　五千人转入文化学习
    【本报唐山讯】特约通讯员周耀东报道：唐山开滦煤矿总工会自去年十月初旬起采取大规模业余短期的轮训班的方式，在广大矿工中进行系统的马列主义教育，截至目前为止，已有三万多职工（占全体职工的百分之六十以上）参加了此项学习，预定在一二月内，可将百分之八十以上职工轮训完毕。轮训后的工友，已有四千八百余人分别转入工人业余学校进行文化学习。
            短期内讲明革命的几个基本问题，提高工人阶级觉悟。
    轮训班的教育方针是在短期内讲明革命的几个基本问题，提高工人群众的阶级觉悟，在阶级觉悟基础上进行政策教育。教育计划最初是每期学习七天至十天，简要地讲明“劳动创造世界”、“阶级斗争”、“共产主义与共产党”、“三个敌人四个朋友”、“劳资两利”、“树立新的劳动态度”等六个问题，后来每期改为半个月，将“三人敌人四个朋友”并在中国共产党的最低纲领内讲解，“新的劳动态度”合并在“劳资两利”之内。每矿（按开滦煤矿共有五个矿）每期参加学习人数由六百人至一千人，按工作时间分两班或三班学习。每天学习两小时。轮训班由各矿与工会文教部主办，建立了健全的班务委员会（由各矿的工会、军代表、中共党委、青年团负责人组成），各班设班干事会（由工人积极分子组成），在统一领导下，分工负责，进行领导管理工作。教员由各矿中共党委委员与具有初步理论基础的干部担任。学员学习完毕后按成绩分甲、乙、丙、丁四等发给毕业证书。
    由于大批工人参加了轮训，在工人群众中产生了很大的影响。工人的阶级觉悟提高了，初步树立了唯物主义观点。工人们靠近了党和工会，巩固了工会的组织，职员与工人、工人与工人的团结也进步了。同时工人们认识了劳动的伟大意义，转变了过去多半轻视自己下井做活，以劳动为耻辱的思想。群众中涌现出大批的积极分子，克服了过去少数积极分子常常处于孤立地位的现象。
            学习要求随着受训提高，为文化学习打下基础。
    此外，职工的学习要求也随受训而提高。过去工人下班后很少去俱乐部和图书馆，现在总是挤得满满的。轮训班为今天的文化学习打下了很好的基础。
    该矿在进行这一工作中有如下几种体会：
    一、教员讲课应注意联系群众经验，力求简单扼要，通俗易懂，并适当采用讨论方式（首先作简单引言，然后提出问题，启发答案，发展争论，最后分析、解答、作结论），这样作还能解决学员文化程度不齐（如林西矿轮训班第四期一、○三九名受训职工的文化程度统计：大学占百分之十三，中学百分之十五，小学百分之三十六·五，文盲百分之二十五·五），要求不一致的困难。但要作到这点，必须教员首先作好准备，并虚心向群众学习，了解群众思想状况及所存在的问题。同时，教学中心要明确，分别轻重，抓着重点，集中讲主要的基本问题，并避免前后重复。
    二、健全学习组织和工作制度，在工作中贯彻群众路线。有的矿在开办轮训班之初即成立了班务委员会，各班又设班干事会，建立了会议、汇报、请假、考勤等制度，及时反映情况，解决问题。每班在班干事会下，以工会支会为单位设立分队，使学习组织和工会组织结合起来，由学员选出分队长、小组长，及时督促启发领导本分队的学习。
    三、加强学习指导工作，认真组织讨论。有些轮训班已受训职工分派到小组内作骨干，担任学习干事，采取了“翻身吐苦水”的座谈方式或开辩论会等，以启发工人的学习情绪，收效很大。有的轮训班并采用“升降榜”等方式，及时公布考试成绩，以鼓励学员的上进。
