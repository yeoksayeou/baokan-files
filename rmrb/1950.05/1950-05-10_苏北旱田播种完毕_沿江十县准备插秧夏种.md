Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 8th. More than 20 million mu of dryland in the Subei area have been sown. The paddy field areas in the ten counties along the Yangtze River are actively preparing for rice transplanting and summer planting. In mid-April, more than 80% of corn and sorghum had been sown in counties such as Lianshui, Qidong, and Yancheng. The grains sown in early April in the Nantong and Taizhou regions now have seedlings that are two to three inches above the water. Guanyun, Shuyang and other counties suffered from rainstorms last month. About three million mu of spring fields were flooded. After rescue by the people of various counties, most of the water has been drained, and replanting is proceeding intensively.
　　When carrying out spring plowing and sowing, the farmers in Subei generally practice deep plowing, careful cultivation, and timely sowing. The amount of fertilizer applied is also higher than in previous years. For example, in the Yancheng region, 70% to 80% of paddy fields and wheat fields have been fertilized. Farmers in Jianyang County have accumulated more than 123,000 boats of fertilizer. The county people's government has also issued timber loans to help farmers repair more than 1,060 waterwheels. According to the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, farmers in Lianshui, Yancheng and other counties have actively organized labor exchange and mutual assistance to solve the difficulties of lack of manpower and animal power during cultivation. More than 300 plowing mutual aid groups have been organized in Yancheng County. Lianshui County has achieved the goal of not leaving a single person or cow idle. The county people's government also promptly issued 700,000 jin of corn loan seeds to support farmers in spring sowing. Farmers in the heavily affected Qidong County generally lacked seeds this spring. After the county people's government loaned 1.2 million jin of corn seeds and a large amount of spring plowing emergency relief grain, the county carried out a ten-day intensive sowing in early April, completing more than 80% of the sowing.
　　At present, leading cadres at all levels in Subei are going to various districts and villages to conduct in-depth inspections of spring plowing and sowing, and to help poor farmers who have not yet sown solve specific difficulties. The 8.5 million jin of grain and 20,000 dan of salt recently allocated by the East China Military and Political Committee, as well as the 1 million jin of rice and 975,000 jin of flour donated by the people of Southern Jiangsu, have been transported to the disaster areas to support the disaster victims in completing spring plowing and sowing.

　　苏北旱田播种完毕
    沿江十县准备插秧夏种
    【新华社上海八日电】苏北区二千余万亩旱田已播种完毕，沿江十余县水田地区正积极准备插秧夏种。涟水、启东、盐城等县四月中旬已有百分之八十以上的玉米、高粱下种，南通、泰州两专区于四月初下种的谷物，秧苗现已出水二三寸高。灌云、沭阳等县上月遭受雨灾，被淹春田约三百万亩，经各县人民抢救，现已大部脱水，正紧张进行补种。
    苏北农民在春耕播种时，一般都做到深耕细作和及时下种，施肥量也较往年增加。如盐城专区施肥的水田、麦田已达百分之七十到八十。建阳县农民积肥达十二万三千余船。该县人民政府并发放木料贷款，帮助农民修好水车一千零六十余部。涟水、盐城等县农民根据自愿两利的原则，纷纷组织变工互助，解决耕种时缺乏人力畜力的困难。盐城县组织了三百多个拉犁互助组。涟水县做到不闲一个人和一条牛。该县人民政府并及时发放玉米贷种七十万斤，扶助农民春播。重灾区启东县农民今春普遍缺少种籽，经该县人民政府贷放一百二十万斤玉米种和大批春耕急救粮，全县在四月初即进行了十天突击播种，完成下种百分之八十以上。
    目前苏北各级领导干部正分头到各区、村深入检查春耕春种工作，帮助尚未下种的贫苦农民解决具体困难。华东军政委员会最近拨发的粮食八百五十万斤，食盐两万担，以及苏南人民捐助的大米一百万斤，面粉九十七万五千斤，都已经分别运到灾区，支援灾民完成春耕春种。
