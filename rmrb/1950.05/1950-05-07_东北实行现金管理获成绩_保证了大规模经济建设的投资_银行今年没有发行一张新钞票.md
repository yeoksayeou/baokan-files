Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 6th—The Northeast Bank has not issued a single new banknote since the beginning of this year, but it has still guaranteed the huge amount of investment required for large-scale economic construction, and prices have remained normal and stable. This is the result of the implementation of cash management and transfer systems in Northeast China over the past year to accelerate currency withdrawal and save cash expenditures.

　　Since April of last year, when state-owned enterprises and institutions at the Northeast Greater Administrative Area level began to implement cash management, cash payments between departments have been reduced by four-fifths by the end of the year due to transfers through the General Accounting Bureau. Bank deposits doubled during the same period. Together with the issuance of public bonds, this ensured that price increases throughout last year did not exceed 80 percent, which greatly facilitated production and construction. After the bank became a center for cash, settlement, and credit in the first quarter of this year, cash payments were further reduced. At the end of February, the inventory increased by 361.8 percent compared to December of last year, and although basic construction needs and long-term investments were allocated in March, the inventory still increased by 267.8 percent compared to December of last year.

　　The implementation of cash management in Northeast China initially was conducted by the General Accounting Bureau of the Northeast People's Government; however, the bureau could not handle credit, which caused difficulties for various enterprise departments in implementing economic accounting. At the same time, the bureau did not have subordinate agencies directly under it to supervise the use of funds by various enterprise departments. Therefore, starting in January of this year, the Northeast People's Government further transferred all transfer and cash management to the Northeast Bank for handling, integrating cash management with the new settlement system and credit system. In the first quarter, 42 enterprise units at the Northeast Greater Administrative Area level, 87 enterprise units at the provincial and municipal levels, and the Northeast Bank established settlement relationships. These enterprise units are not allowed to lend to each other or make direct payments in cash. Their sales transactions must be transferred within the funds deposited in the Northeast Bank; if the payment exceeds the deposit, the bank will grant credit as appropriate. This greatly reduced cash expenditures. For example, after 17 units under the Northeast Industry Department implemented settlement with the bank in January, they saved nearly half the cash compared to December of last year. At the same time, since any unit is required to retain cash not exceeding the amount used on the same day, the deposit amount of the Northeast Bank at the end of March increased by more than double that of December of last year.

　　In order to accelerate cash deposit, the Northeast Bank in various locations has taken various measures. One of these is the implementation of mobile collection methods. After the Harbin branch implemented mobile collection, cash was concentrated in the bank 16 hours earlier than in the past. Each unit can also reduce the round trips and expenses of cashiers and separate remittances. Many places have also adopted the method of signing contracts, stipulating the time and method of payment, in order to collect large amounts of money. At the same time, banks in various places have also implemented holiday shifts and shift systems to extend the collection time to facilitate the deposit of cash by various units on the same day. For large enterprises with more complex cashier affairs, the bank has adopted the method of dispatching resident cashiers to handle receipts and payments.

　　Strengthening the work of checking cash inventory has played a significant role in urging various departments to reduce unnecessary cash storage. In February, Shenyang City conducted a random inspection of 106 government agencies and enterprises and found that most of them were able to consciously abide by the Northeast People's Government's decision on cash management, but some units still had very serious cash hoarding. For example, the cash inventory of the Shenyang Liaison Station of the Northeast Timber Factory exceeded its daily expenditure by 31 times. In March, Harbin City inspected 152 units. According to statistics, the average daily inventory volume in the ten days after the inspection decreased by 35 billion yuan compared to the ten days before the inspection, increasing the bank's revolving funds by 35 billion yuan every day.

　　The main difficulty in cash management in Northeast China at present is that the cash income and expenditure plans of various enterprise units are mostly formulated from top to bottom and are not precise enough. Therefore, in actual execution, there are deviations from the original plan. In the future, preparations will be made to gradually formulate cash income and expenditure plans from bottom to top. At the same time, various branches must also compile overall plans each month based on their own income and expenditure situations and the cash income and expenditure plans of various units in order to further achieve accurate cash management requirements.

### 东北实行现金管理获成绩  保证了大规模经济建设的投资  银行今年没有发行一张新钞票

　　东北实行现金管理获成绩
    保证了大规模经济建设的投资
    银行今年没有发行一张新钞票
    【新华社沈阳六日电】东北银行今年以来没有发行一张新钞，但仍然保证了大规模经济建设所需要的巨额投资，物价也正常、平稳。这是东北一年来实行现金管理和转账制度，以加速货币回笼、节约现金开支的结果。
    从去年四月起，东北大行政区一级国营企业和机关开始实行现金管理以后，到年底止各部门间的往来，由于经过总会计局的转账，现金支付减少了六分之五。同一时期内银行存款增加二倍。这样就与公债的发行一起保证了去年全年物价上涨不超过百分之八十，大大有利于生产建设的进行。今年第一季度银行成为现金、结算和信贷中心以后，现金支付更大为减少。二月底库存额较去年十二月增加了百分之三百六十一点八，三月份虽因拨付基本建筑需用和长期投资，但库存额仍较去年十二月增加了百分之二百六十七点八。
    东北实施现金管理开始时是经过东北人民政府总会计局进行的；但由于该局不能办理信贷，使各企业部门在贯彻经济核算时发生困难。同时该局没有直属的下级机关，不能监督各企业部门资金的使用。因此从今年一月起，东北人民政府就进一步将转账与现金管理全部交由东北银行办理，使现金管理工作和新的结算制度、信贷制度结合起来。第一季度内，已有四十二个东北大行政区一级的企业单位，八十七个省、市一级的企业单位和东北银行建立结算关系。这些企业单位相互间不得进行借贷或以现金进行直接支付。其买卖往来款项，须在存入东北银行的款项内转拨；付款超过存款时，由银行酌情给予信贷。这就使现金开支大为减少，如东北工业部所属十七个单位，一月份到银行实行结算后，即较去年十二月节省现金将近一半。同时，由于任何单位保留现金都规定不得超过当日的使用量，因之三月底东北银行的存款额就比去年十二月增加了一倍以上。
    为加速现金入库，各地东北银行采取了各种办法。其中之一是实行流动收款办法。哈尔滨分行实行流动收款后，使现金比过去提早十六小时集中到银行。各单位并可因此减少出纳员和分别送款的往返周折和费用。很多地方并采取订合同的办法，规定交款时间、办法，以收纳大宗款项。同时各地银行且实行假日值班、分班制，延长收款时间，以便利各单位现金当日入库。对出纳事务较繁的大企业，银行则采取派出纳驻在员代理收付的办法。
    加强检查库存现金的工作，对督促各部门减少不必要的现金储存起了很大作用。沈阳市二月份抽查了一百零六个机关企业单位，发现大部分均能自觉遵守东北人民政府关于现金管理的决定，但尚有部分单位积压现金现象仍极严重。如东北木材厂沈阳联络站库存现金即超过其日常开支量达三十一倍。哈尔滨市三月份检查了一百五十二个单位，据统计检查后十天的库存量较检查前十天的库存量总平均每天减少了三百五十亿元，使银行周转资金每天增加三百五十亿元。
    目前东北现金管理中的主要困难，是各企业单位的现金收支计划多系从上而下地制订出来，还不够精确。因而在实际执行中就与原计划有出入。今后准备逐渐做到自下而上制订现金收支计划，同时各分支行也须逐月根据本身的收支情况，及各单位的现金收支计划，编制总的计划，以进一步达到精确管理现金的要求。
