　　Xie Sunshi Should Be Punished by Law
　　Daughter-in-law Driven to Death, Already Detained by the Beijing Municipal People's Court
Editor:
　　After Su Xiuling, the daughter-in-law of Xie Jiabin (employee of the Palace Museum), a resident of No. 4 Jingshan Qian Street, died by suicide from taking poison due to abuse by her mother-in-law, Xie Sunshi, the surrounding masses were extremely indignant. The Beijing Municipal People's Court, in order to safeguard human rights, has detained Xie Sunshi.
　　Xie Sunshi is eccentric, fierce, and ruthless. She adopted her nephew, Xie Tongjun, as her son (a leather worker). He married Su Xiuling in March of last year. Xiuling was hardworking and industrious, and even washed Xie Sunshi's foot bindings for her. Last summer, Xiuling accidentally broke a thermos. The mother-in-law insisted that her daughter-in-law intentionally prevented her from drinking hot water, and immediately smashed all the teapots and teacups that Xiuling had brought as dowry. From then on, she disliked her daughter-in-law. When stewing meat, the daughter-in-law was not given any. When eating noodles, the daughter-in-law was only left with broth. All supplies were locked in the cabinet, and the daughter-in-law was not allowed to touch them. Last year, Xie Jiabin contracted erysipelas, and pus was flowing out of his ears. Xie Sunshi, because of her poor eyesight, asked her daughter-in-law to wash her father-in-law's ears for her. However, one time when the mother-in-law came back from buying groceries, she happened to see Xiuling wiping pus for her father-in-law, and immediately said angrily, "As long as I am here, I will take care of him. When I am not home, you wash your father-in-law's ears, what intentions do you have!" This incident greatly traumatized Xiuling.
　　Living in such conditions, Xiuling initially did not dare to quarrel with her mother-in-law, only complaining to her husband in private. Later, she was forced to the point where she could no longer endure it and had to argue with her mother-in-law publicly, but was then considered "unfilial" and "not virtuous." The long-term suppressed distress finally led to Xiuling's suicide.
　　Editor: China has been liberated, and the People's Government has promulgated the Marriage Law, but the cruel phenomenon of mothers-in-law abusing their daughters-in-law can still be seen everywhere. I hope you will publish this matter in the newspaper to arouse serious attention from society.

### 谢孙氏应受法律制裁  逼死儿媳妇已被京市人民法院扣押

　　谢孙氏应受法律制裁
    逼死儿媳妇已被京市人民法院扣押编辑同志：
    景山前街四号居民谢嘉宾（故宫职员）儿媳苏秀玲因受婆婆谢孙氏虐待服毒身死以后，附近群众对此极为愤恨。北京市人民法院为维护人权起见，已将谢孙氏扣押。
    谢孙氏个性乖张凶狠，过继侄儿谢同君为子（制革工人），他在去年三月娶苏秀玲为妻。秀玲克苦耐劳，平日连谢孙氏的裹脚布都由她洗。去年夏天，秀玲不慎将暖水壶摔坏了，婆婆硬说媳妇有心不叫她喝热水，马上把秀玲陪嫁来的茶壶茶碗都摔了，从此看见媳妇就不顺眼。炖肉吃没有媳妇的份儿，吃面“疙疸”只剩点汤给媳妇喝，一切用品都锁在柜子里，不许媳妇过问；谢嘉宾去年得大头翁病，耳朵里往外流脓，谢孙氏因眼睛不好，叫媳妇代她给公公洗耳朵，但有一次婆婆买菜回来，正赶上秀玲给公公擦脓，立即气愤的说，“有我在一天，我会伺候他，我不在家你就给公公洗耳朵，存的什么心呀！”这件事对秀玲刺激很大。
    处在这种日子里，秀玲当初还不敢跟婆婆吵嘴，只在背地里向丈夫申诉苦处，后来逼得实在无法忍受，只得公开和婆婆顶嘴，但又被认为“不孝”、“不贤”。长期积压的苦闷，终于促成了秀玲的自杀。
    编者同志：中国已经解放了，人民政府的婚姻法颁布了，但婆婆虐待媳妇的残酷现象还到处可以看到。希望你们把这件事情在报上发表，以引起社会的严重注意。
