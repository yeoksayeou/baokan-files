　　How to Improve Nursing Work
    Wang Kuizhao, Head Nurse of People's Hospital

    Improving nursing work in hospitals is one of the primary keys to improving the quality of medical work. It is also a basic condition for strengthening and consolidating new medical concepts in the new society, because nursing work can further alleviate and cure the suffering of working people who unfortunately become ill. We know that most people who come to the hospital for treatment are forced to leave their jobs, bearing great mental and physical pain, and they need comfort and care. If patients do not get peace and joy in the hospital, it will affect their recovery. At the same time, if hospital staff, especially nurses, are indifferent to patients and sloppy in their work, it will be difficult to achieve the desired results, no matter what treatment methods are used. I think that whether day or night, constantly making patients feel that the ward is better than their own home and cooperating with the doctor's treatment plan to make patients recover as soon as possible, is the central task of nurses.

    To accomplish this task, we must first pay attention to cleanliness and order in all aspects. It shouldn't be that there are spider webs hanging in the corners, dust on the door frames or under the beds, the windows are never wiped or not wiped clean, there is dirt on the floor, and the patient's body, bedding, and shirts are dirty, so that the patient does not get any peace and comfort. Special attention should be paid to the more seriously ill patients who cannot walk. Nurses should also pay attention to keeping the air in the ward fresh and clean, and ventilate it several times a day. Some patients may be afraid of the cold and not allow the air vents to be opened. At this time, the nurse should explain the relationship between fresh air and disease in detail to the patient, and pay attention to covering the patient carefully when opening the window, so as not to let the patient directly touch the cold air. Everyone knows these things, and some people think they are trivial, but we must understand that the entire work of the hospital is precisely the result of the collection of every small thing.

    Nursing work should be careful and thoughtful. For example, in the hospital, the supply of nutrition to patients is of great significance. A good nurse will pay attention to the temperature of the food, the cleanliness of the utensils, and whether it is suitable for the patient, etc., and should send boiled water to the patient in a timely manner. For critically ill patients, nurses should personally feed them food and water. For injuries, arthritis, and lung disease patients' bedding, if the nurse is careful, she will tidy them up in a timely manner to make them as comfortable as the patient wants; otherwise, it will make the patient's limbs feel distressed, and even make the disease worse. Some patients cannot sleep because they cannot keep their limbs warm. In this case, the nurse should use a hot water bottle to keep the patient's limbs warm. For example, critically ill patients will not develop bedsores under careful care; conversely, if the nurse's work is poor, bedsores will develop quickly, which will greatly affect the patient's recovery.

    The nursing work for patients is not enough to just do a good job in hygiene and cleanliness, but also to provide patients with spiritual comfort. To keep the ward quiet and orderly, this responsibility should be borne partly by the treating doctor, but the doctor can only contact the patient for a short time each day, while the nurse is always in front of the patient day and night. Therefore, the nurse should first set an example in the ward. Whether it is to the patient or to other staff members, the attitude must be kind, the spirit must be happy, there should be no unhappy expressions, and even less should there be quarrels and anger. Nurses should get as close as possible to all patients, be familiar with the pain of each patient, comfort the patient, dispel the patient's pessimistic thoughts, and give the patient confidence in their recovery. This confidence is a necessary condition for recovery. Moreover, if the nurse can gain respect and belief among the patients and workers, they will unconditionally listen to and implement the nurse's words and opinions.

    Nurses should often carry out their own professional study, enrich theory, and improve technology. Moreover, while improving cultural level, they should intensify political study, and establish the idea of serving the injured and sick wholeheartedly, so as to improve the quality of nursing work. Today, as a nursing worker, I ask all nursing workers to work hard to improve their work in order to meet the requirements of this great new era.

　　怎样提高护理工作
    人民医院护士长　王奎照
    提高医院内的护理工作，是提高医务工作质量的首要关键之一，也是使新社会里新医疗观点，加强与巩固的基本条件之一，因为护理工作能使不幸而得病的劳动人民的痛苦，获得进一步减轻治好。我们知道，到医院里治疗疾病的人们，大多数是不得已离开了自己的工作岗位，在他（她）们的精神和肉体上都担负着很大的痛苦，是需别人的安慰和体贴的，如果病人在医院里，得不到安静和愉快，就会影响他们健康的恢复。同时医院里工作人员，特别是护士，如果对患者毫不关心，工作粗枝大叶，那么不论是施行任何治疗方法，都很难收到预期的效果。我想无论是白天或夜里，经常使患者感到病室比自己家里还好，并且配合医生的治疗方针，使病人早日痊愈，这就是护士的中心任务。
    要完成这个任务，首先一定要注意到各方面的清洁和秩序。不会是：在墙角处悬有蜘蛛网，在门框上或床下有尘埃，窗上的玻璃总也没有擦或擦的不干净，地板上有土，病人的身体被褥，衬衣都很污秽，病人得不到一点安静和舒服。这其中尤其要照顾无法行走的较重病人。护士还应该注意到使病室内的空气经常保持新鲜洁净，一天须行数次换气，可能有的患者怕冷而不让开气窗，此时护士应对患者详细解说，新鲜空气与疾病的关系，并且要注意到在开窗时，须周密盖上患者，不要使患者直接触冷气，这些事情大家都知道，也有些人认为是小来小去的事情，可是我们要了解到，医院内的整个工作，正是由于每一件小的事情，集合而成的。
    护理工作应该细心而周到，例如在医院里，患者营养的供给有很大的意义，好的护士要注意到饮食的凉热，食器的洁净及对于病人是否合适等，要适时把开水送到患者面前，对重症患者要由护士亲自喂饭喂水。又如对于创伤，关节炎及肺病患者的被褥，若是细心的护士，他定会及时的加以整理，达到患者所愿意的那样舒适；否则，会使患者的肢体感到苦恼，甚至使疾病坏转。有的患者因为不能使自己的肢体得到温暖而睡不着觉，遇着此种情形时，则护士应使用暖水袋使患者的肢体得到温暖。又如重病患者在细心的护理下不致于发生褥疮；相反的，若护士工作不良，则很快即会发生褥疮影响病人的恢复很大。
    对患者的护理工作，不仅是卫生清洁方面作好了就算够了，同时还得使病人得到精神上的安慰。要使病室内保持肃静而有秩序，固然这个责任一部分应由治疗医生来担任，但医生一天只能与患者接触很少时间，而护士不分昼夜总是在患者跟前，因此护士在病室里首先应以身作则，不论是对患者或是对其他工作人员，态度一定要和蔼，精神要保持愉快，不应有不高兴的表现，更不可争吵和动怒。护士应尽可能多与一切患者接近，熟知各个患者的苦痛，安慰患者，打消患者的悲观思想，使患者对自己的恢复健康有信心，这种信心是恢复健康的必要条件。而且，护士若能在患者和工友中获得尊重和信仰他（她）们才能无条件的听从和执行护士的言语和意见。
    护士应经常进行自己的业务学习，充实理论，提高技术。而且在提高文化水平的同时，要加紧政治学习，确立全心全意为伤病者服务的思想，这样才能提高所作的护理工作质量，在今天以一个护理工作者的身份，我要求一切的护理工作者，努力提高自己的工作，以配合这个伟大的新时代的要求。
