　　Suzhou State-Owned Professional Companies
    Vigorously Support Private Enterprises
    [Our Dispatch from Suzhou] To implement the policy of taking into consideration both public and private interests and to help industrial and commercial enterprises overcome production and sales difficulties and restore production, Suzhou's state-owned professional companies and the People's Bank have been supporting the city's private enterprises through methods such as purchasing, processing, acting as sales agents, placing orders, and providing loans.
    The Suzhou branch of the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company purchased over 30,000 bales of cotton yarn from January to April. In April, to help the private Yuankang Yarn Factory solve its financial difficulties, it purchased 100 bales of yarn from them. In April, the Suzhou branch of the China National Grain Corporation sold 405,916 catties of rice and 7,300 bags of flour through consignment sales. In addition, it entrusted the private Zhenda Rice Mill to process 1,022,738 catties of indica rice, and the Yong'an Rice Mill to process 1,251,920 catties of indica rice. To address the difficulties of slow sales of finished products in the private knitting and chemical industries, the department store branch purchased 1,000 boxes of soap from Yuhua Soap Factory, 80 dozens of socks from Xinguang and Yude Sock Factories, 50 dozens of towels from Dakang Factory, 50 dozens of undershirts from Fuhua Factory, and 87 dozens of undershirts from Hongji Factory. The local products branch, in conjunction with the current production and disaster relief work, purchased rural sideline products. Preliminary statistics show that it has purchased 10,000 dan of firewood, 2,500 straw mats and pillow mats, 50 baskets of eggs, and items such as rain capes and bamboo hats.
    As of May 15, the People's Bank of Suzhou's loan balance to private industrial and commercial enterprises had increased nearly twofold compared to the end of February. At the end of last year, the bank provided 128 bales of Lion Brand yarn to the Litai Yarn Factory through order placement; in January, it ordered 150 bales of Tianguan yarn and 50 bales of Hongli yarn from the Cotton Textile Industry Joint Office; in March, it granted overdraft and fixed-term collateral loans of 100 million yuan each to the Sulun Yarn Factory and the Suzhou Yarn Factory, and a loan of 5,900 accounting units to the Dongwu Silk Factory.
    The above purchases, processing, orders, and loans have been of great help to these factories in overcoming difficulties and turning over capital.
