　　Resolutely Complete the Cotton Planting Task
　　Xing Yi
    Due to the emphasis and vigorous, in-depth inspection by leaders at all levels regarding the cotton planting task, the profitability experienced by cotton farmers last year, the necessary and possible preparatory work carried out in general areas among both leadership and the masses, the timely announcement of the cotton-grain price ratio policy by the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council, coupled with abundant and timely spring rains, the broad masses of farmers are demonstrating a high level of enthusiasm for cotton planting. Many areas began engaging in the cotton planting movement after the Qingming Festival. As of the end of April, Hebei Province's statistical data shows that the cotton planting area has reached 10.03 million mu, accounting for 83.5% of the province's original plan. As of now, many special districts and counties have exceeded their planned targets. The Handan Special District originally planned for 2.1 million mu, but now aims to reach 3 million mu. The Wu'an, Feixiang, and Handan counties within this district have already exceeded their plan by a total of over 110,000 mu. Zhengding County has exceeded its original plan by 20,000 mu. In Huolu County, the first, fifth, and eighth districts had already exceeded the original plan by 30 to 40% by mid-April. In the Pingyuan Province, many districts and villages in Lin County, Anyang, Tangyin, and Xinxiang counties have exceeded their plans. In Shanxi, the Yuncheng and Linfen special districts have already planted one million mu of cotton fields in a timely manner. In Henan, Jia County has planted 45,000 mu of cotton, an increase of 10,000 mu compared to last year, and Linru County had completed over 70% of its original cotton planting plan by the end of April. In Shandong, the Lebei Special District has now completed planting approximately one million mu of cotton, reaching about 70% of its target. The three provinces of Liaodong, Liaoxi, and Rehe have planted 4.17 million mu of cotton this year, double that of last year and exceeding the central government's requirement by a strong 26%. However, from a national perspective, to complete the task of planting 50 million mu, we still need to make the greatest effort, and we must not allow any blind optimism to exist. In many areas, due to insufficient understanding of the significant implications of the cotton planting task for urban-rural mutual assistance, the worker-peasant alliance, and national industrial construction, or excessive emphasis on objective difficulties, emphasis on cotton farmers' ideological concerns, or the subjective belief that the timely spring rains mean there will be no problem in completing the task, or excessive faith in lower-level reports without conducting in-depth inspections, negative pessimism or blind complacency have arisen, leading to a laissez-faire attitude towards cotton planting work. For example, in the three counties of Shan, Ling, and Wen in Henan Province, after deploying the task in early February, they were left to their own devices without attention to inspection and promotion. The Bohai Special District in Shandong Province plans for 4.15 million mu, but is facing a situation where the task cannot be assigned. The Qinghe Special District, except for Boxing County, will find it difficult to complete the task. In Haicheng, Northeast, relying solely on reports without conducting inspections, the county reported 400,000 jin of cotton seeds in stock to the province for disposal, but in fact, areas within the county considered to have better preparations for cotton planting, such as the Dongliugong and other three villages, still lack more than 13,000 jin of seeds. In the Pingyuan Province, some counties reported that they have completed their tasks, but in-depth inspections reveal that they are far from completing the task. Serious problems such as the fact that the Shijiazhuang Special District of Hebei Province still has more than 5 million jin of cotton seeds that have not been distributed, that only more than 9,000 jin of the 1.7 million jin of cotton seeds prepared in Jin County have been sold, and that only more than 60,000 jin of the 820,000 jin of cotton seeds in Zhao County have been sold. Once discovered, these problems have attracted the attention of local leaders for correction or are in the process of being corrected, but "Qingming is early, Xiaoman is late." Now there is only half a month until Xiaoman, and time is pressing. How to ensure the timely planting of cotton fields and 100% completion of the task should become a serious issue for production leaders in various regions. For this reason, we believe that the following points must be noted:
    1. Conduct in-depth publicity and mobilization, combined with solving current practical difficulties to break through the thinking of cadres and the masses, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. Therefore, it is necessary to fully explain the importance of the cotton planting task among cadres and the masses. At the same time, it should be pointed out that the national war is nearing its end, finance and economy are unified, prices are stable, transportation is smooth, factories have been restored one after another, and the relationship between urban and rural areas is gradually returning to normal. These situations provide favorable conditions for ensuring the sales of cotton and the supply of grain in cotton-growing areas. There is a solid material basis for guaranteeing the implementation of the cotton-grain price ratio regulations promulgated by the Finance and Economic Committee of the Government Administration Council and protecting the interests of cotton farmers. At the same time, local governments should clearly announce that all cotton fields will be levied only once in the autumn, and should also widely solicit cotton farmers' opinions on last year's cotton purchase in order to correct errors and shortcomings in a timely manner. Supply and marketing cooperatives and cotton yarn and cloth companies in various cotton-growing areas should vigorously purchase cotton farmers' existing cotton to solve their current difficulties, and should generally sign cotton purchase contracts with cotton farmers, or selectively try out pre-purchase, to dispel their ideological concerns. Areas lacking grain and fuel should actively find ways to adjust grain and coal to solve cotton farmers' food and fuel difficulties.
    2. Strengthen organizational leadership and conduct in-depth inspection campaigns. Many areas, such as Hebei Province, are now organizing tens of thousands of cadres to go deep into districts and villages to supervise and inspect, which has achieved great results. This is commendable. At present, all areas that have conducted inspections, but lack sufficient organizational strength, or have not conducted timely inspections, should immediately organize a large number of cadres to go deep into districts and villages to conduct specific inspections. In all areas with the necessary conditions, efforts should be made to exceed the plan and plant as much as possible, and in general areas, efforts should be made to complete the task. In individual areas, if the originally planned target exceeds the actual possible planting conditions, the task can be appropriately reduced. In areas lacking seeds, efforts should be made to organize allocation immediately, and in areas where improved varieties have not yet been lent, efforts should be made to lend them as soon as possible, resolutely overcoming certain cadres' conservative views and purely profit-seeking views. In areas where cotton seedlings have already emerged, attention should be paid to checking seedlings, replanting missing seedlings, and protecting seedlings. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize rural Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, village cadres, labor heroes, and production models to take the lead actively and lead all male and female full and semi-labor forces in rural areas to participate in cotton planting work, and to organize labor mutual assistance to solve the difficulties of the masses in cotton planting due to lack of labor, livestock, and agricultural implements.
    3. Paying attention to technical guidance and strengthening the organization of disease and pest control are important keys to ensuring increased unit area yield of cotton fields and improving farmers' enthusiasm for cotton planting. Therefore, all technical cadres must go deep into cotton-growing areas and closely integrate with county, district, and village cadres in charge of local production, cotton-planting heroes, and technical experts to guide farmers in seed selection, seed soaking, the use of chemical fertilizers, and all technical guidance work. Strive for a good start to cotton planting and lay a solid foundation for increased cotton production and a bumper harvest. At the same time, it is necessary to investigate the time when the main diseases and insect pests of cotton occur locally, and take effective preventive measures as early as possible, such as setting up disease and pest control stations, collecting local medicinal materials, purchasing pesticides and equipment, summarizing and promoting local methods, and training district and village cadres in large numbers to learn how to use new insecticides and equipment, so as to fully utilize all available insecticides and equipment and maximize their effectiveness. In order to eliminate diseases and insect pests and prevent them from spreading into disasters, it is necessary to establish an information network, strengthen contact, and exchange information, and discover and eliminate them at any time.
    The task of cotton planting is very arduous and significant, the season is very urgent, and there are difficulties, but they can and must be overcome. Therefore, it is required that the leading organs in various places get rid of all non-urgent work, concentrate all their efforts to carry out a surprise cotton planting campaign, and strive to successfully complete this major and arduous cotton planting task.

　　坚决完成植棉任务
    邢毅
    由于各级领导机关对植棉任务的重视组织大力深入检查，由于去年棉农获利，由于一般地区不论在领导上或群众中均进行了必要与可能的准备工作，由于中央人民政府政务院财经委员会适时的公布了棉粮比价政策，加以春雨充沛而又及时，故广大农民植棉情绪十分高涨，不少地区于清明节后纷纷投入植棉运动。河北省四月底统计植棉面积已达一千零三万亩，占该省原计划的百分之八十三点五。截至目前，不少专县业已超过计划，邯郸专区原计划二百一十万亩，现争取达到三百万亩，该区武安、肥乡、邯郸三县现已超过计划共十一万亩。正定县超过原计划二万亩。获鹿县一、五、八区四月中旬已超过原计划的百分之三十到四十。平原省林县、安阳、汤阴、新乡等县不少区村均超过计划。山西运城、临汾两专区百万亩棉田已适时下种。河南郏县已种棉四万五千亩，较去年扩大一万亩，临汝县四月底植棉已达原计划的百分之七十以上。山东泺北专区现已完成植棉百万亩左右，已达任务数的百分之七十上下。辽东辽西热河三省本年植棉四百一十七万亩，较去年增一倍，超过中央规定百分之二十六强。但目前从全国来说，对完成五千万亩的任务，仍需作最大的努力，决不容我们丝毫盲目乐观情绪存在。不少地区由于对植棉任务关系到城乡互助、工农联盟及对国家工业建设的重大意义认识不足，或者过分强调客观困难，强调棉农思想顾虑，或者主观地认为春雨及时完成任务不成问题，或者过分相信下级报告不作深入检查，因而产生消极悲观或盲目自满等情绪，对植棉工作放任自流。如河南陕、灵、阌三县自二月初布置任务后，听其自流不注意检查推动。山东渤海专区计划四百一十五万亩，有分配不下的情势，清河专区除博兴县外均难完成任务。东北海城光听报告不作检查，把所存棉籽四十万斤报省处理，但事实上该县认为植棉准备较好的地区如东柳公等三村却尚缺种一万三千余斤。平原省有的县报告已完成任务，但深入检查，距完成任务尚远。河北石家庄专区仍存五百余万斤棉种尚未发放，晋县准备一百七十万斤棉种仅卖出九千余斤，赵县有棉籽八十二万斤，仅卖出六万余斤等严重现象。这些问题，一经发现已引起当地领导上的注意纠正或正在纠正中，但“清明早，小满迟”，现在到小满仅有半月光景，为时紧迫，如何保证棉田的适时下种，百分之百的完成任务，应成为各地生产领导上的严重问题。为此我们认为必须注意以下几点：
    一、进行深入宣传动员，结合解决当前实际困难以打通干群思想，充分发挥群众的积极性，因此必须在干部中、群众中充分说明植棉任务的重要，同时要指出今年全国战争已接近结束，财经统一，物价稳定，交通畅达，工厂已先后恢复，城乡关系已逐渐走向正常状态等情况，对保证棉花的销路及棉区粮食的供应提供了有利的条件。对保证执行政务院财委会公布的棉粮比价的规定，保障棉农利益已有坚实的物质基础。同时当地政府应明确宣布，所有棉田一律在秋季一次征收，更应广泛征求棉农对去年在棉花征购中的意见，以便及时纠正错误，改正缺点。各棉区供销合作社、花纱布公司应一面大力收购棉农现存棉花，解决棉农当前困难，一面应普遍和棉农订购棉合同，或有重点地试行预购，解除其思想顾虑，粮食及燃料缺乏地区要积极设法调剂粮食与煤炭，解决棉农食粮与燃料的困难。
    二、加强组织领导、深入开展检查运动，不少地区如河北省现组织数万干部，深入区村进行督促检查，已取得很大成绩，这是值得表扬的。目前凡是已进行检查，但组织力量不足，或者尚未进行及时检查，要立即组织大批干部深入区村进行具体检查。在一切有条件的地区应争取超过计划，尽量多种，在一般地区应争取完成任务。在个别地区如有原订计划超过其实际的可能播种条件时，可适当减少任务。在种子缺乏的地区，应立即设法组织调剂，在良种尚未贷放下去的地区，争取早日贷放下去，坚决克服某些干部保守观点及单纯营利观点。在棉苗已经出土的地区应注意查苗、补苗保苗工作。因此必须动员农村共产党员青年团员村干劳动英雄、生产模范等积极带头、领导农村一切男女全半劳动力参加植棉工作，并组织劳动互助，以解决群众在植棉中的劳力畜力及农具缺乏的困难。
    三、注意技术指导，及加强防除病虫害的组织，是保证棉田单位面积的增产，提高农民植棉情绪的重要关键；因此一切技术干部要深入棉区和当地领导生产的县区村干部植棉英雄技术能手密切结合，指导农民进行选种、浸种、引用化学肥料以及一切技术指导等工作。争取植棉工作的良好开端，为棉花增产丰收打下坚实的基础；同时要调查当地棉花主要病虫害发生的时间，及早进行有效防止的措施，如设立病虫防治站，搜集土药材购置农药及器械，总结推广土办法，以及大批训练区村干部，学会运用新的杀虫药品及器械，以便充分运用一切可以得到的杀虫药品、器械，使之尽量发挥其效能。为了消灭病虫害不使蔓延成灾，必须建立情报网、加强联系、互通情报。随时发现，随时消灭。
    植棉任务是很艰巨而重大的，季节是很紧迫的，困难是有的，但能够而且是必须克服的。因此要求各地领导机关摆脱一切非当务之急的工作，集中全力开展一个突击植棉运动，为胜利的完成这个重大的艰巨的植棉任务而努力。
