　　Overview of North China Workers' Work in the Past Year

    Workers in North China's provinces have made great contributions to the recovery and development of industrial production over the past year. Around the development of the production movement, local trade unions have initially established their own grassroots organizations and have held various welfare undertakings that are conducive to the development of production.

    The recovery of industry is much better than expected

    The state of industrial recovery and production in North China provinces over the past year is much better than expected. The output of the twenty-three public-owned factories and mines in Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province, has approached or exceeded pre-war levels. Among them, the monthly output of important industries such as steel, iron, and coke has now exceeded pre-war levels by 10% to 55%. All industrial sectors accurately completed their production plans in the first quarter of this year. The Tangshan Steel Plant, Qixin Cement Plant, Yaohua Glass Factory, and some provincial-run factories and mines in Hebei Province have exceeded their output during the Kuomintang period by 10% to 15%. Since the launch of a major inspection of factories and mines in Chahar Province last November, industrial production has made great progress. Production in factories and mines in Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, and Datong has generally increased. The production rate of the Zhangyuan Winery increased from 22% to 24.3% in January, and the oil extraction rate of the vegetable oil factory also increased from 27.3% to 28.9%.

    The vast number of employees work selflessly, and their achievements in creation and invention are brilliant.

    The acquisition of these production achievements is inseparable from the selfless efforts of the broad masses of workers. The working class, who have been freed from their enslaved status and become masters of the machines, have contributed their sweat and wisdom, constantly overcoming the difficulties encountered in restoring production. In Taiyuan City, Shanxi Province alone, more than 150 technical inventions by workers to overcome difficulties have been successfully tested in the past year. After research and modification of the machinery by the staff, the monthly output of sulfuric acid at the chemical plant has exceeded the highest monthly output in the plant's history by 94%. Workers in factories and mines in Hebei Province have made more than 200 inventions. The nineteen inventions of workers in Shijiazhuang City have increased production efficiency by an average of 69%. During the restoration and reconstruction of Pangjiabao and Yantongshan in Chahar Province, there was a severe shortage of equipment, and workers walked through the mountains and fields in the cold winter snow, carefully searching for scattered equipment. When repairing the twenty-four old water pumps with more than 1,500 horsepower in Pangjiabao, the workers dismantled the parts and carried more than 100 kilograms each, crossing the mountains to wash them in the river a mile away. Workers have also made great contributions to production savings. The raw materials saved by eighteen model young workers in Taiyuan City in one year are equivalent to 2,097,200 kilograms of millet. Due to the development of production savings by workers, the coal consumption of the Tangshan Power Plant in Hebei Province has gradually decreased from 0.95 kg of coal per kilowatt-hour to 0.56 kg. Although the machines in the Baoding and Qinhuangdao power plants have exceeded their insurance period, the coal consumption has also decreased by about 20%.

    Trade union organizations develop rapidly, and workers' welfare is significantly improved.

    Around the development of the production movement, trade union work in various places has achieved remarkable results. Chahar Province has organized 376 trade unions in various occupations such as mines, railways, and transportation, and the number of workers participating in trade union organizations has reached 48% of all workers. The number of organized workers in Hebei Province has reached 59% of all workers in the province. In addition to establishing trade union organizations in shipping, industry, and transportation, the province has also established nine central county and town trade unions and seventy-six county trade unions. In Taiyuan alone, Shanxi Province, 64% of the city's workers are organized. In Pingyuan Province, 54.7% of industrial workers have joined trade unions. Although Suiyuan Province was liberated not long ago, trade union organizations in GuiSui, Baotou and other places have been established one after another. In GuiSui City, 77% of workers in public factories have joined trade union organizations.

    Under the leadership of the trade union, workers' welfare undertakings have made significant new progress. After the establishment of consumer cooperatives in factories in various places, they can generally distribute necessities to employees at prices 2% to 6% lower than market prices, guaranteeing the lives of employees in the face of price fluctuations. With regard to labor insurance, improvements have been made since the comprehensive safety inspection conducted in North China last November. In Taiyuan City, more than 23,000 employees have implemented labor insurance in accordance with the Labor Insurance Regulations. Each provincial-run factory in Hebei Province has established a labor insurance fund, and some factories have also established labor insurance committees. In addition, factories in various places have improved or rebuilt equipment such as medical clinics, bathhouses, nurseries, and barbershops within the scope of possibility. In terms of workers' cultural education, Hebei Province has successively established thirty-four formal workers' spare-time schools within one year, with 15,800 employees regularly enrolled. Tangshan, Shijiazhuang and other places have also held classes at the primary, senior primary, and junior high school levels according to the degree of education, and plan to raise the cultural level of enrolled workers by one level within five or six years. In Chahar Province, eighty-eight units in Zhangjiakou and Datong alone have organized spare-time schools, with a regular enrollment of 2,500 people. In addition, many factory trade unions have gone deep into the workshops to carry out mobilization work and launched workers to run production newsletters, blackboards, and broadcasting groups. All of these works have played a great role in promoting production.

    Trade union work has taken many detours and should continue to be strengthened in the future.

    The development of trade union work in various provinces over the past year has generally been on the right track after taking some detours. First of all, in terms of organizational work, all localities had produced a tendency of closed-doorism before July last year. After the All-China Federation of Trade Unions convened a trade union work conference in July last year, closed-doorism was largely overcome; however, at the same time, there was a tendency of formalism. Many places adopted methods such as holding meetings to sign up and registering door-to-door to recruit members, so some saboteurs were mixed into the trade union. It was not until around January of this year, with the development of the production movement and the signing of labor-capital collective contracts in private enterprises, that the organizational work of trade unions embarked on a steady path of progress. Secondly, on the issue of trade union work facing production, all localities were not very clear about this policy at the beginning, and generally focused on improving workers' welfare. Many trade union cadres held incorrect views, attaching importance to manual laborers but not to skilled workers. In addition to holding meetings, the trade union could not intervene in other work, leaving the slogan of developing production in empty political mobilization, and did not pay enough attention to how to go deep into the workshops, lead production, and how to establish and improve the factory democratic management committee to improve and strengthen enterprise leadership. Although some factories have established democratic management committees, they are mostly formal. After the People's Daily in Beijing published an editorial "Learn to Manage Enterprises," trade union cadres in various places seriously studied, so that these wrong ideas and practices were more thoroughly corrected.

    The main problems currently existing in trade union work are: First, the work of grassroots trade unions has not been well established. Many trade unions still only have members but lack the specific work content of trade unions. The work of the Democratic Management Committee, especially the Workers' Congress, has not been well strengthened. Second, the development of trade union organizations is very uneven. Generally, public enterprises are developing better, while private enterprises are developing poorly. In order to better mobilize workers, unite capitalists to overcome difficulties, and develop production in the future, it is a very important task to carry out trade union organizational work in private enterprises.

### 一年来华北工人工作概况

　　一年来华北工人工作概况
    华北各省工人，在一年来的工业生产的恢复与发展中，供献极大。围绕着生产运动的开展，各地工会已初步建立起自己的基层组织，并举办了各种有利于发展生产的福利事业。
    工业恢复状况远较预料为好
    一年来华北各省工业恢复生产的状况，远较所预料者为好。山西省太原市二十三个公营厂矿的产量均已接近或超过战前水平，其中钢、铁和焦炭等重要工业的月产量，目前均已超过战前水平百分之十到百分之五十五不等。各工业部门，并在今年的第一季生产中，准确地完成了生产计划，河北省唐山制钢厂、启新磁厂、耀华玻璃厂和省营一部分厂矿，已超过国民党时期产量百分之十到十五。察哈尔省自去年十一月开展工矿大检查后，工业生产有极大进展。张家口、宣化、大同等厂矿生产普遍提高一步。张垣酿造厂在一月份内生产率即由百分之二十二提高到百分之二十四点三，植物油厂出油率亦由百分之二十七点三提高到百分之二十八点九。
    广大职工忘我工作  创造发明成绩辉煌
    这些生产成绩的获得是和广大工人群众的忘我努力分不开的。摆脱了奴隶地位而成为机器主人的工人阶级，供献出自己的血汗和智慧，不断的克服了在恢复生产中所遇到的困难。山西省仅太原市一地，一年来工人在克服困难中的技术发明，经试验成功者，即达一百五十余件。化学厂硫酸的月产量，经过职工研究和改装机器后，已超过该厂历史上最高月产量的百分之九十四。河北省各地厂矿中，工人发明已达二百余件。石家庄市工人的十九件发明，平均提高生产效率百分之六十九。察哈尔省庞家堡、烟筒山在恢复与重建中，器材奇缺，工人在严冬风雪中，走遍山坡野地，仔细搜寻散置器材。庞家堡的一千五百余匹马力的二十四部旧水泵修建时，工人将零件卸下，每人背上一百多斤，越过山岭到一里外的河水中冲洗。在生产节约方面，工人的供献也很大。太原市十八位模范青年工人在一年内所节省的原料，折小米二百零九万七千二百斤。河北省唐山发电厂，由于工人开展了生产节约，煤耗量逐步下降，由每度煤耗零点九五公斤，降到零点五六公斤。保定、秦皇岛两市发电厂的机器虽超过保险年限，而煤耗量也约下降了百分之二十。
    工会组织迅速发展  工人福利显著增进
    围绕着生产运动的开展，各地工会工作均获得显著成绩。察哈尔省已组织起来的矿山、铁路、搬运等各种职业工会已达三百七十六个，参加工会组织的工人达全部工人百分之四十八。河北省有组织的工人数已达该省全部工人数的百分之五十九。该省除建立了航运、产业、搬运等系统的工会组织外，并建立了九个中心县镇工会和七十六个县工会。山西省仅太原一地，有组织的工人达全市工人的百分之六十四。平原省产业工人加入工会者已达百分之五十四点七。绥远省虽解放不久，但归绥、包头等地的工会组织也均先后建立，归绥市工人参加工会组织者在公营工厂中已达到百分之七十七。
    在工会领导下，工人的福利事业有显著的新进展。各地工厂中的消费合作社建立后，一般均能按低于市价百分之二至六向职工配售必需品，保证了在物价波动中的职工生活。在劳动保险工作上，去年十一月全华北进行了安全大检查后，已有改进。太原市按照劳动保险条例而实行劳动保险的职工，已达二万三千多人。河北省省营各厂均已建立了劳动保险基金，部分工厂中并建立了劳动保险委员会。此外，各地工厂对于医疗所、澡堂、托儿所、理发室等设备，亦均在可能范围内予以改进或重建。在职工文化教育上，河北省在一年内已先后建立正规的工人业余学校三十四处，经常入学职工达一万五千八百余人。唐山、石家庄等地亦都分别按程度举办初小、高小、初中等班次，计划在五、六年内使入学工人的文化水平提高一级。察哈尔省仅张家口、大同两地就有八十八个单位组织了业余学校，经常入学人数已达二千五百余人。此外，还有不少工厂的职工会，深入车间，开展鼓动工作，发动工人自己办生产喜报、黑板报、广播小组等。以上这些工作，对于推进生产，均起了很大作用。
    工会工作走过不少弯路，今后还应继续加强。
    一年来各省工会工作的发展，大都是在走了一些弯路之后逐步走上正轨的。首先，在组织工作上，各地在去年七月份以前均曾产生过关门主义偏向。全国总工会在去年七月召开工会工作会议后，关门主义大部克服；但同时却又产生了形式主义的偏向。有不少地方采取开会报名、挨门登记等方法吸收会员，因而在工会中曾被混进了某些破坏分子。直到今年一月前后，伴随着生产运动的开展和私营企业中订立劳资集体合同等工作，工会的组织工作才走上稳步前进的道路。其次，在工会工作应面向生产的问题上，各地在开始时对这个方针不甚明确，一般都偏重于改进工人福利。不少工会干部存在着不正确的观点，重视苦力而不重视技术工人。工会除了开会以外，别的工作都插不上手，把发展生产的口号停留在空洞的政治动员上，对于如何深入车间，领导生产，如何建立与健全工厂民主管理委员会的工作，以改进和加强企业领导，则注意不够。有些工厂虽然建立了民主管理委员会，但亦多流于形式，自北京人民日报发表了“学会管理企业”的社论以后，各地工会干部才认真学习，使这些错误的思想和作法，得到了比较彻底的纠正。
    目前工会工作中所存在的主要问题是：第一、基层工会工作还未很好建立起来，有许多工会还是只有会员而缺少工会的具体工作内容。民主管理委员会，特别是职工代表会的工作，还没有好好加强。第二、工会组织的发展还很不平衡，一般的是公营企业发展较好，私营企业较差。为了今后更好的发动工人，团结资方战胜困难，发展生产，在私营企业中开展工会组织工作，是一个很重要的任务。
