A Visit to the Shijiazhuang People's Court Detention Center
    Sun Guoxing, Department of Education, Beijing Normal University
    When we walked into the Shijiazhuang People's Court Detention Center, if it weren't for the wooden sign outside the gate with the name of the organization, we wouldn't have thought this was a "prison." — This is a factory, because many people are working here; this is a school, because many people are learning here.
    Detention Center and Self-Renewal Center: After the explanation by the comrades in charge of the center, we understood the difference between these two terms. The detention center is for imprisoning unconvicted criminals. The purpose for this type of prisoner is to conduct ideological education to make them realize their mistakes. The prisoners in the Self-Renewal Center have already been sentenced and are in the process of reform.
    The sentenced prisoners all enter the factory established by the center to engage in various production tasks. Unconvicted prisoners also participate in minor labor such as pasting matchboxes.
    Prisoners often launch competitions during production, and the center conducts ideological education during the competitions. Those who are active in production are praised, and sometimes there are material rewards; those with poor labor attitudes are criticized. Each competition can improve the prisoners' thinking and labor attitude, and a group of activists emerge. Now, they are in the Red May competition. The blackboard newspaper publishes large production plans and challenge letters.
    Under the guidance of the center, the production and education of prisoners are all organized and led by the prisoners themselves. Its organizational structure is the Production Committee and the Education Committee. The former leads the farm, brick kiln, woodworking factory, iron factory, chemical factory, and weaving factory. Each factory has a branch of the Education Committee, which leads the prisoners' study groups and education groups, volunteer classes, correspondence groups, blackboard newspapers, and hygiene groups.
    When prisoners have reformed to a considerable extent, they can go to the farm to serve, produce and sell on their own, and report accounts regularly. They can also ask for leave to go home and visit. But they must abide by the convention, otherwise they will be criticized. Prisoners are willing to strive to go to the farm for production. The center ensures that prisoners have two hours of study every day, collective lectures or group discussions. Teachers are selected from prisoners with higher political and cultural levels. There is also fixed recreational time: singing, Yangko dancing, and playing the Overlord Whip. Prisoners live a democratic life in the center, they have criticism meetings and self-criticism meetings. In this way, prisoners not only reform their thinking in the center, but also establish a labor viewpoint and learn production technology. The center sometimes introduces released prisoners to work in various factories. Some prisoners open small factories themselves after being released. Some prisoners are unwilling to leave after serving their sentences, and the center retains them. All released prisoners have established close relationships with the center. Recently, the center plans to add an accounting training class to cultivate prisoners' specialized skills.
    This visit gave me a great education. It made me more clearly aware of the difference between the new society and the old society.

　　石家庄人民法院看守所参观记
    北京师范大学教育系  孙国兴
    当我们走进石家庄人民法院看守所的时候，假如没有大门外写着机关名字的木牌子，我们就不会想到这里就是“监狱”。—这儿是工厂，因为有许多人在做工；这儿是学校，因为有许多人在学习。
    看守所和自新所：经过所内负责同志的解说，我们知道了这两个名词的分别。看守所是监禁未判决犯人的。对这类犯人是进行思想教育，使他们认识错误。自新所的犯人是已经判决的，而正在改造过程中。
    已判决的犯人都进入所方设立的工厂，从事各种生产工作。未决犯也参加糊火柴盒等较次的劳动。
    犯人们在生产当中，也时常发动竞赛，所方并在竞赛中进行思想教育。生产积极的受表扬，有时还有物质奖励；劳动态度不好的要受批评。每次竞赛，都能使犯人的思想和劳动态度提高一步，并涌现一批积极分子。现在，他们正处在红五月竞赛中。黑板报上登载着大幅的生产计划和挑战书。
    犯人的生产和教育，在所方辅导下，一切都由犯人自己组织，自己领导。它的组织机构是生产委员会和教育委员会。前者领导农场、砖窑、木工厂、铁工厂、化学工厂、织布工厂、打轴工厂。各工厂都有教育委员会分会，领导犯人的学习小组和教育组、义务班、通讯组、黑板报、卫生组等组织。
    犯人改造到了相当程度，可以去农场服务，自己生产，自己出售，定时报账。有事时还可以请假回家看看。但须遵守公约，否则要受批评。犯人们都愿意争取到农场去生产。所里对犯人保障每日两小时的学习，集体听讲或分组讨论。老师是由犯人中选拔政治文化水平较高的人充任。并有固定文娱时间：唱歌、扭秧歌、耍霸王鞭等。犯人们过着所内的民主生活，他们有批评会和检讨会。就是这样，犯人们在所内不独改造了思想，而且建立了劳动观点，学到了生产技术。刑满出狱的犯人，所方有时还介绍他们到各工厂去工作。有的犯人出狱后，自己开设了小型的工厂。也有犯人刑满后不愿离去，所方便留用他们。所有被释的犯人，和所方都建立了亲密的关系。最近所方拟添设会计训练班，培养犯人的专门技术。
    这次的参观给我很大的教育。使我更明确地知道了新社会与旧社会间的不同。
