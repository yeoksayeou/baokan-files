Xinhua News Agency, 14th: Under the auspices of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace, over six thousand representatives from all sectors of the capital and from national people's organizations solemnly convened a signature rally for the Declaration for the Defense of World Peace at Zhongshan Park in Beijing on the 14th. Those in attendance included Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace, committee members Tan Pingshan, Ma Xulun, Peng Zemin, Chen Qiyuan, Li Dequan, Qian Sanqiang, Xie Bangding, Wu Yaozong, Xiao San, Xu Deheng, Xu Beihong, Li Jinxi, Shao Lizi, Zheng Zhenduo, etc., Vice Mayor of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Zhang Youyu, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions Xiao Ming, and representatives of workers, peasants, troops, women, students, citizens, government workers, writers, and artists from the capital.

　　A huge World Peace Congress emblem, the full text of the Stockholm Appeal, and portraits of Chairman Mao and Stalin were hung high at the venue. The flags of thirty-eight countries, including China, the Soviet Union, various people's democratic countries, and Asian colonial countries, fluttered in the wind. The masses in attendance held countless red flags and banners with slogans such as "Unconditionally Prohibit the Use of Atomic Weapons," "People of the World Who Love Peace, Unite," "Asian People Unite to Oppose Imperialist Aggression," and "Struggle for Lasting World Peace."

　　The conference opened with the national anthem of the People's Republic of China. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace, first delivered a speech to the conference after leading the release of thirty-four white doves symbolizing peace. He said: More than one billion people worldwide have already been drawn into the great struggle for peace, which shows that the people of the world urgently need peace. On the other hand, it also indicates that peace is indeed under threat. Guo Moruo pointed out: The crisis of war certainly exists, but the crisis of war is entirely surmountable. In the face of the great strength of the peace-loving and democratic people of the world, if imperialism dares to launch a war, it is preparing to hold its final funeral.

　　Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu called on the two million citizens of Beijing to participate in the signature campaign, regardless of gender, age, occupation, or religion.

　　After conveying the proceedings and resolutions of the Stockholm Conference, Xiao San emphasized: The appeal for the defense of world peace and the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons poses the question of one's attitude towards opposing war to all honest people, and there can be no neutrality on this matter. Now, hundreds of millions of people in various countries around the world have widely launched this signature campaign. The active participation of the Chinese people in this movement will become a powerful expression of our people's determination to defend the Far East and world peace, and will inspire progressive people in all countries.

　　Xiao Ming pointed out in his speech: The working class of Beijing must not only participate in the signature campaign but also use practical actions to build a new China and increase the strength of the world's defense of peace.

　　Wu Yaozong said: Religious figures throughout the country will use their utmost determination to smash all attempts by imperialism to use religion to carry out instigation and sabotage activities.

　　Qian Sanqiang said: Progressive scientists all over the world are against atomic warfare. The purpose of scientists should be to use atomic energy for the benefit of mankind.

　　In addition, Li Dequan, Xie Bangding, army representative Zhang Hongjun, and peasant representative Bai Yushan all spoke at the meeting, unanimously expressing their firm belief in winning world peace.

　　After the speeches at the conference, Chairman Guo Moruo solemnly read out the Appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress on the Prohibition of Atomic Weapons. The entire audience unanimously raised their hands and applauded enthusiastically in support of this appeal, and immediately dispatched hundreds of representatives to the rostrum to sign.

　　The conference also unanimously adopted a telegram of condolence to Professor Joliot-Curie and protesting against the reactionary measures of the French government in persecuting Professor Joliot-Curie.

　　Finally, the conference ended with thunderous slogans such as "The Chinese People Support the Resolutions of the Swedish Conference," "Long Live the People of the World Who Love Peace," and "Long Live World Peace."

    【新华社十四日讯】在中国保卫世界和平大会委员会主持下首都各界人民代表和各全国性人民团体的代表六千余人，十四日于北京中山公园隆重举行保卫世界和平宣言签名运动大会。到会的有中国保卫世界和平大会委员会主席郭沫若，委员谭平山、马叙伦、彭泽民、陈其瑗、李德全、钱三强、谢邦定、吴耀宗、萧三、许德珩、徐悲鸿、黎锦熙、邵力子、郑振铎等，北京市人民政府副市长张友渔，北京市总工会副主席萧明及首都工人、农民、部队、妇女、学生、市民、机关工作者、作家、艺术工作者的代表。
    会场高悬着巨幅的世界拥护和平大会会徽、斯德哥尔摩会议呼吁书全文和毛主席、斯大林的画像。中国、苏联、各人民民主国家、亚洲各殖民地国家等三十八国的国旗迎风招展。到会的群众高举着无数的红旗和“无条件禁止使用原子武器”、“全世界爱好和平的人民联合起来”、“亚洲人民团结起来反对帝国主义侵略”、“为世界持久和平而斗争”等标语。
    大会在中华人民共和国国歌声中开幕。中国保卫世界和平大会委员会主席郭沫若在率领放出了三十四只象征和平的白鸽后，即首先向大会发表讲演。他说：全世界已有十万万以上的人民卷入了争取和平的伟大斗争，这就说明全世界人民都迫切地需要和平。这在另一方面也就表示着和平的确是受着威胁。郭沫若指出：战争的危机诚然存在，但是战争的危机是完全可以克服的。在全世界和平民主的人民的伟大力量面前，帝国主义如果敢于发动战争，那他们是在为自己准备举行最后一次的火葬。
    张友渔副市长号召北京市二百万市民，要不分男女、老少、职业、宗教、通统起来参加签名运动。
    萧三在传达了斯德哥尔摩会议的经过和决议之后着重指出：保卫世界和平与无条件禁用原子武器的呼吁书，向所有正直的人提出他对反对战争这个问题的态度，在这件事上是不能有中立的。现在全世界各国的亿万人民已广泛地展开了这一签名运动。中国人民的积极参加这一运动，将成为我国人民决心保卫远东及世界和平并鼓舞各国进步人民的有力表示。
    萧明在讲话中指出：北京市的工人阶级不仅要参加签名运动，还要用实际行动来建设新中国，增加全世界保卫和平的力量。
    吴耀宗说：全国宗教界人士都会用最大的决心来粉碎帝国主义利用宗教进行挑拔离间和进行破坏活动的一切企图。
    钱三强说：全世界进步的科学家都在反对原子战争，科学家的目的应该是把原子能用于造福人类。
    此外，李德全、谢邦定、部队代表张鸿钧、农民代表白玉山都在会上讲了话，一致表示赢取世界和平的坚强信念。
    在大会讲话后，郭沫若主席庄严地宣读了世界拥护和平大会常设委员会关于禁用原子武器的呼吁书，全场一致举手和热烈鼓掌表示拥护这个呼竽书，并且立即派出了成百个代表到主席台上签名。
    大会并一致通过了慰问约里奥——居里教授并抗议法国政府迫害约里奥——居里教授的反动措施的电文。
    最后大会在“中国人民拥护瑞典会议决议”、“全世界爱好和平的人民万岁”、“世界和平万岁”等雷动的口号声中结束。
