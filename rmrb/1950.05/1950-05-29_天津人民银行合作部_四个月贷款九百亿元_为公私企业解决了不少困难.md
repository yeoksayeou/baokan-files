Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 27th -- Under the principle of "developing production, taking into account both public and private interests," the Cooperation Department of the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank has solved many difficulties for public and private enterprises, and has provided strong support for private production enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. From January to April of this year, the department's total loan amount was 90,066,576,000 yuan, of which loans to public enterprises accounted for 38.9% of the total; private enterprises accounted for 29.6%; and cooperative enterprises accounted for 31.5%.

The main use of the bank's large amount of loans was to support private production enterprises through public enterprises. The main use of loans to public enterprises was to support agriculture and the salt industry, totaling more than 31 billion yuan. The former was transferred through the Bohai Reclamation Bureau to farmers in various reclamation areas under the bureau, and with the exception of a very small amount used for state-owned farms, the vast majority was used for water conservancy facilities in various areas; the latter was transferred through the Changlu Salt Affairs Bureau to various private salt fields. Although these loans are listed as public loans, the actual users of the loans are private enterprises. If these loans are combined with private loans, the total amount of private loans will reach more than 58 billion yuan, accounting for 65% of the total loan amount.

Through loans, the bank promoted and organized small producers and promoted the exchange of goods. Cooperative loans were mostly used for supply and marketing cooperatives, totaling more than 25.7 billion yuan, mainly in the form of credit loans and overdrafts, to the North China and Tianjin Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and two cooperative warehouses, as funds for urban and rural material exchange and export of local products. Production cooperation loans totaled more than 950 million yuan, mainly to leather shoes, fur, and peanut picking production cooperatives for purchasing raw materials; consumer cooperation loans totaled more than 1 billion yuan, mainly to consumer cooperatives for citizens, institutions, and factories as working capital.

Another important use of the bank's loans is to support the brick and tile industry and handicrafts. There are 76 brick and tile kilns in the city. Under the collective leadership of the industry association, a production plan of 120 million bricks was formulated this spring. In addition to self-reliance in raising funds, the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank has loaned a total of more than 1.83 billion yuan in real value loans in the past four months, which has basically solved the difficulties of the industry's three raw materials: coal, grain, and earthwork.

In terms of handicrafts, the bank mainly supported several more important industries related to the national economy and people's livelihood and exports. In the past four months, it has loaned more than 1.75 billion yuan to the carpet industry, more than 1.64 billion yuan to the cotton weaving industry, and more than 10 million yuan to the knitting industry, most of which were loaned in real value for raw materials.

    四个月贷款九百亿元         
    为公私企业解决了不少困难
    【新华社天津二十七日电】人民银行天津分行合作部在“发展生产，公私兼顾”的方针下，曾为公私营企业解决不少困难，并对于有利于国计民生的私营生产事业，加以有力的扶植。该部今年一至四月份贷款总额为九百零六亿六千五百七十六万元，其中贷给公营企业的占总额百分之三八·九；私营企业占百分之二九·六；合作事业占百分之三一·五。
    该行大批贷款的用途，首先是通过公营企业扶持了私营生产事业。对公营企业贷款中的主要用途是扶助农业和盐业，约三百一十余亿元。前者系通过渤海区农垦局，转贷给路局所属各垦区农户者，除极少数用于国营农场者外，绝大部分是用于各区水利设备；后者是通过长芦盐务局转贷给各私营盐滩。这些贷款虽然列入公营放款，但实际使用贷款者却属私营企业，如将此类贷款合并到私营放款内，则私营放款总额将达五百八十余亿元，即占放款总额的百分之六十五。
    通过贷款，该行推动和组织了小生产者，促进物资交流。合作贷款中以用于供销合作者占绝大多数，计二百五十七亿余元，主要以信用贷款及透支等方式，贷给华北及天津两个供销总社与两个合作货栈，作城乡物资交流和土产出口资金之用。生产合作放款计九亿五千余万元，主要贷给皮鞋、皮毛、挑花生等生产社购置原料；消费合作放款计十亿余元，主要贷给市民、机关及工厂等消费社做为周转资金。
    该行贷款另一重要用途是扶持砖瓦业与手工业。本市砖瓦窑计七十六家，在该业公会集体领导下，在本年春季订出了一亿二千万砖的生产计划，生产资金除自力筹划外，人民银行天津分行四个月来共贷给折实放款十八亿三千余万元，基本上解决了该业煤、粮、土方三种原料的困难。
    在手工业方面，该行主要扶持了与国计民生及出口有关的几种较重要的行业。四个月来计贷给地毯业十七亿五千余万元，棉织业十六亿四千余万元，针织业一千余万元，大部系以折实方式贷给原料。
