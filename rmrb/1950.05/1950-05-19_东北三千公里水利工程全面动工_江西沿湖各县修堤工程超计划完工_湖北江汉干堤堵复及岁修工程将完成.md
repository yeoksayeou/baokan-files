Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 15th: May is the most critical season for water management in Northeast China. The vast water conservancy project, spanning over three thousand kilometers in both North and South Manchuria, has now started in full swing with the participation of hundreds of thousands of farmers. Repairing old dikes, accounting for nearly half of the entire project, is the main task of river management in the region this year. Water irrigation work also focuses on repairing and restoring existing irrigation areas. For dike construction, canal repair, drainage projects with greater benefits, and irrigation areas with greater development prospects, focused efforts will be carried out. The total planned earthwork amounts to more than 42.7 million cubic meters, mobilizing more than 15 million man-days, doubling the scale of the project compared to last year.

　　The Liao River dike project, the focus of water management in Northeast China this year, has been progressing rapidly since it fully commenced in mid-April, and is expected to be completed by early June. Liaoxi Province, which suffered the most from the Liao River flooding last year, has expanded its water management project by nearly two times compared to last year. The 63-li-long Liao River dike repair project in Changbei County, Liaoxi Province, has been completed ahead of schedule, and the Xiaoling River dredging project was also completed in mid-April. Yingkou, Haicheng, and Liaoyang counties, located at the vital point where the Liao River enters the sea, began construction of dikes and drainage gate projects last month. People in the Zhelimu League of Inner Mongolia, located in the upper reaches of the Liao River, have completed the construction of a 530-kilometer-long dike along the West Liao River under the guidance of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government Water Conservancy Bureau engineering team and with the cooperation of the People's Liberation Army Inner Mongolia Military Region troops.

　　Spring repair projects in various provinces and counties of the Songhua River system in North Manchuria also started one after another last month. In addition to vigorously carrying out the Taoer River dike project, Heilongjiang Province has launched a large-scale water conservancy construction campaign along the banks of eleven rivers in twenty-eight counties throughout the province in order to complete the plan of reclaiming more than 46,000 mu of new paddy fields and ensuring that 1.95 million mu of dry land is protected from flooding. Water irrigation projects in Jilin and Songjiang provinces are now under intensive construction in order to timely supply the water needed for paddy fields this month. The 2,800-meter-long dike repair project in Hunchun County, Jilin Province, has also been completed, effectively guaranteeing an increase of 7,000 tons of grain in the county this year.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, May 15th: Dike repair projects in lakeside counties and districts of Jiangxi Province have been completed ahead of schedule, and preparations are now underway for the summer flood season. The original plan for the embankment project of more than 400 dikes in the province required 10.78 million cubic meters of earthwork, but now 11.65 million cubic meters of earthwork have been completed, exceeding the original plan by 8 percent, and the stone work has also exceeded the original plan by 21 percent. The entire dike repair project used a total of 6.7 million man-days. All dikes that should be repaired have been heightened and thickened according to the different conditions of each dike, and the construction standards have exceeded the highest water level of the local area last year and the year before by more than five centimeters. The farmland benefiting from this embankment repair will reach 4.4 million mu.

　　During the dike repair, the Jiangxi Provincial People's Government successively allocated 25 million jin of rice and adopted the method of "public undertaking with government assistance and work relief" to solve various difficulties in the repair. Each special zone also established a dike restoration committee from top to bottom to unify leadership and organize the masses to carry out dike repair.

　　The summer flood season is approaching. The water level of the Gan River has been rising since mid-April, and on May 4th it once rose to 21.05 meters, exceeding the warning level by 0.05 meters. In order to prevent the summer flood, the Provincial People's Government recently ordered governments at all levels along the river and lake to establish river system flood control committees, and to prepare flood control materials according to the length of the dike and the condition of dangerous works; for dikes that do not meet the standards, people will be organized to rush repairs. The Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau has also set up eleven flood reporting stations at key points in each river system in order to grasp the water situation in time. Counties along the dikes are actively preparing various flood control materials such as wood and sacks to meet urgent needs.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, May 15th: The closure and annual repair projects of the main dikes of the Yangtze River and Han River within Hubei Province are about to be fully completed. As of May 5, 94.2 percent of the earthwork project had been completed, totaling more than 102.23 million cubic meters; 85 percent of the revetment stonework project has been completed. The above-mentioned completed earthwork project is equivalent to 1.33 times the project completed by the Kuomintang during the four years from 1946 to 1949; the stonework is equivalent to three-quarters of what the Kuomintang completed in the above four years. At present, various places are continuing to actively rush repairs to ensure that all projects are completed before the flood season.

　　东北三千公里水利工程全面动工
　　江西沿湖各县修堤工程超计划完工
　　湖北江汉干堤堵复及岁修工程将完成
    【新华社沈阳十五日电】五月份是东北治水最紧张的时节，南北满共达三千余公里的浩大水利工程，在数十万农民参加之下现已全面动工。占全部工程几及一半的修补旧堤，是今年全区治河的主要工程。水利灌溉工作也以修建、恢复已有灌溉区为主；对于效益较大的筑堤、修渠排水工程以及发展前途较大的灌溉区，则将有重点地进行。全部计划挖土共达四千二百七十余万公方，动员民力一千五百余万人工，工程规模较去年增大一倍。
    作为东北今年治水重点的辽河堤防工程，自上月中旬全面开工以来，进展迅速，预计将于六月上旬全部完工。去年遭受辽河泛滥祸害最大的辽西省，今年治水工程较去年扩大了将近两倍。该省昌北县六十三里长的辽河堤防补修工程已提前竣工，小淩河的挖河工程也已在上月中完成。地当辽河入海要冲的营口、海城、辽阳三县，在上月开始了修建堤防和排水闸门工程。辽河上游内蒙哲里木盟沿河地区人民，在内蒙人民政府水利局工程队的指导和人民解放军内蒙军区部队的配合下，已完成了西辽河长达五百三十公里的修筑堤防工程。
    北满松花江水系各省、县的春修工程也于上月间先后开工。黑龙江省除大力进行洮儿河堤防工程外，并为完成新开水田四万六千余亩及保证一百九十五万亩旱田免受水灾的计划，在全省大小十一条河流沿岸二十八个县展开大规模的兴修水利运动。吉林、松江两省的水利灌溉工程现正在加紧施工，以争取本月内及时供应稻田所需水量。吉林省珲春县全长二千八百公尺的修堤工程亦已竣工，使该县今年增产粮食七千吨获得有效的保证。
    【新华社南昌十五日电】江西省沿江湖各县区修堤工程已超计划完工，现正紧张准备预防夏汛。该省四百余个圩堤的培修工程原计划需培土方一千零七十八万公方，现已完成土方一千一百六十五万公方，超出原计划百分之八，石方亦超出原计划百分之二十一。整个修堤工程共用人工六百七十万个。所有应修圩堤均按各堤不同情况进行了加高和培厚，施工标准都超过了去年和前年当地最高水位五公寸以上。由此次培修圩堤而受益的农田将达四百四十万市亩。
    在修堤中，江西省人民政府先后拨发二千五百万斤大米，采取“民办公助、以工代赈”的办法，解决了培修中的各种困难。各专区并从上而下地建立了复堤委员会，统一领导和组织群众进行修堤。
    夏汛即届，赣江水位自四月中旬开始上涨，至五月四日曾一度涨至二十一点零五公尺，超出警告牌位零点零五公尺。该省人民政府为预防夏汛，日前特指令沿江沿湖各级政府成立河系防汛委员会，并按圩堤长度和险工情况，准备防汛器材；对不合标准的圩堤则组织人民突击抢修。该省水利局并已在各河系要点设立了十一个报汛站，以便及时掌握水情。沿堤各县正积极准备木料、麻袋等各项防汛器材，以备急需。
    【新华社汉口十五日电】湖北省境内长江、汉水干堤的堵复及岁修工程，即将全部完成。至五月五日止，土方工程已完成百分之九四·二，计一亿零二百二十三万余公方；护岸石工已完成全部工程的百分之八十五。上述已完成的土方工程等于国民党统治时期自一九四六年到一九四九年四年内所完成工程的一·三三倍；石工则等于国民党在上述四年内所完成的四分之三。现各地正继续积极赶修，保证在汛期前全部完工。
