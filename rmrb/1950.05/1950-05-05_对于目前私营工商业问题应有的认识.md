　　On the Understanding of Current Issues Concerning Private Industry and Commerce
    Sun Xiaocun
    (I)
    In recent months, especially since March, the situation for several private industrial and commercial enterprises in several regions has evidently been quite difficult, particularly in Shanghai. Since the Spring Festival, Shanghai has seen the closure of private businesses almost daily, with factories and shops collapsing, stagnating, halting production, or reducing output. Some factory and shop owners have even absconded, leading to a sharp increase in unemployment, which now stands at around 150,000 people. We must acknowledge that this situation is a major problem. Therefore, the issue of private industry and commerce has become a national concern and has been placed on the agenda for urgent adjustment and resolution.

    There is consensus across various sectors regarding the concern and attention given to this issue. However, perspectives on the problem differ due to varying standpoints and angles. In this article, I aim to clarify these mixed notions.

    (II)
    The difficulties experienced by industries and businesses across various regions exhibit several characteristics:

    First, although the scope of these difficulties is quite widespread, the severity varies significantly from region to region. Generally, larger cities experience greater difficulties than smaller cities, with Shanghai being particularly prominent among the larger cities. Upon deeper analysis, it's evident that cities surrounded by rural areas that have undergone land reform experience less difficulty. Conversely, industrial and commercial enterprises in cities within newly liberated areas face more severe challenges. This is strongly supported by comparing Beijing and Tianjin with Shanghai, as well as comparing several cities in old liberated areas with those in new liberated areas, particularly the areas within and outside the Shanhaiguan Pass. While Beijing and Tianjin have indeed seen some factories and shops close down, many others opened in March and even early April. Moreover, the capital invested in new factories in Tianjin in March was greater than before. This is notably different from the situation in Shanghai. As for the Northeast, the difficulties currently faced by private industries and businesses in various cities within the Shanhaiguan Pass are completely absent. This demonstrates that regions that have undergone land reform and have not experienced war present a different picture altogether.

    Second, Shanghai's prominence stems from the fact that a portion of its industries and businesses catered solely to the consumption of a small number of privileged classes, or even served imperialism directly. In the past, Shanghai-produced goods were typically sold in major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, and Wuhan. Goods produced in Beijing, Tianjin, and Wuhan were then sold in smaller inland cities, while goods produced in those smaller cities were sold in rural areas. Thus, the distance between Shanghai and the vast rural areas was considerable. Therefore, reorienting towards rural areas after liberation has been particularly challenging.

    Third, Shanghai's isolation for a year after liberation and the enemy's major bombing on February 6th are also significant reasons for the prominent difficulties faced by Shanghai's industries and businesses.

    After liberation, cities in North China saw a rise in production due to the restoration of urban-rural exchange. Although they are now encountering some economic difficulties, there has not been a single instance of capitalists abandoning their factories. The situation in Shanghai is worse. Recently, a small number of industrialists and businessmen have almost completely lost confidence. They no longer persevere in maintaining their businesses, seeking only to abscond, which has severely undermined credit relations throughout the market. Does this mean that all the absconding capitalists have reached the end of their ropes? The reality is not entirely so. Therefore, apart from a few with other specific reasons, this psychological change is worth noting.

    Fourth, although this crisis has caused panic among industrialists and businessmen and has significantly impacted urban life, the impact felt in rural areas has been minimal. Farmers are diligently engaged in spring plowing and spring repairs to irrigation works. This indicates that the current difficulties of industry and commerce have inherently unavoidable factors.

    (III)
    The characteristics mentioned above tell us that a profound and correct understanding of the current difficulties in industry and commerce must primarily come from its essential analysis. In the past two months, we have heard appeals and criticisms from various parties, suggesting that the current difficulties in industry and commerce are mainly due to heavy tax burdens and excessive public bond subscriptions, which have significantly reduced the working capital of industries and businesses, thus leading to the current stagnation. Some even argue that stabilizing prices too early and too quickly has left industries and businesses feeling caught off guard by the sudden deflation and price drops. Are these criticisms justified? First, we should acknowledge that the burden of public bonds may indeed reduce the working capital of a particular factory or shop. Regarding taxation, there may also be some shortcomings in the collection procedures. However, all of this is definitely not the main and widespread cause of the current difficulties in industry and commerce, as evidenced by the characteristics mentioned above. Public bonds and taxes are universally levied in cities throughout the country. If this were the primary cause of the difficulties in industry and commerce, why would the situation differ across cities, and why would Shanghai's difficulties be so prominent? Secondly, the initial period of price declines is somewhat painful for industries and businesses. However, this pain is unavoidable when transitioning from inflation to balanced revenue and expenditure. If it doesn't hurt this year, it will hurt next year. Moreover, from a long-term and comprehensive perspective, this is beneficial for industries and businesses. Furthermore, the shift from price declines to stability, stable grain prices, lower interest rates, and reduced expenses create favorable conditions for legitimate industries and businesses after enduring the initial pain. Therefore, it is clear that the current difficulties in industry and commerce are not caused by public bonds and taxes but have more fundamental reasons. Analyzing them: First and most fundamentally, the Chinese people have suffered over a century of imperialist exploitation, longer-term exploitation by feudal landlords, and over two decades of plunder by bureaucratic capital. Coupled with long-term war damage and famine, national vitality has been greatly impaired. The purchasing power of the vast majority of people is generally lacking. Especially in the spring, before wheat, silk cocoons, tea, and rapeseed have been harvested, farmers' purchasing power is traditionally at its lowest, making it a slow month for commerce. The fundamental factors, combined with seasonal influences, make the sales market particularly stagnant, causing significant pressure on urban industry and commerce. Second, after liberation, some industries and businesses have not truly transformed their direction to serve the rural areas and the broad masses of the people. Due to the difficulty of reorientation and conversion, they have remained in the stage of meeting the needs of the old society. The longer this drags on, the greater the losses. Therefore, when facing stable price declines and increasingly normal economic conditions, such industries and businesses find it impossible to sustain themselves. Third, in the past, our industrial production was completely blind. For example, match factories in Beijing and Tianjin could supply North China farmers with eight matches per person per day, while the normal consumption is at most two and a half per person per day, resulting in overproduction. As far as we know today, in addition to matches, similar problems of overproduction exist in the cigarette, flour, and soap industries in various regions. There must be others that we don't know about. Fourth, in the past, our industrial production and sales situation was one where foreign goods dominated Chinese goods, and large cities dominated small cities. As mentioned earlier, imperialist goods mainly targeted Shanghai as their primary market. Shanghai's goods mainly targeted cities like Beijing, Tianjin, and Wuhan. The goods of Beijing, Tianjin, and Wuhan targeted smaller inland cities. In the past, the feudal forces, corrupt politics, and years of war and banditry in the interior did not allow for the slightest possibility of developing production. Now the situation has changed. There is no more war on the mainland, bandits have been eradicated, and small inland cities are also starting their own production. Moreover, they have gained an uncompetitive advantage due to convenient raw materials and low wages. For example, the recent contradictions in the Tianjin market demonstrate that on the one hand, flour products have no sales, while on the other hand, factories manufacturing flour milling machinery are thriving. The orders received from small cities across the country are said to be booked until July of this year. This resistance of small cities to large cities has greatly shrunk the market for large cities because large city factories are far from raw materials, far from sales areas, and have high wages and expenses, making it difficult to compete. Fifth, labor-capital relations are not yet normal. The capitalists argue that wages are too high and that they cannot streamline and dismiss workers. On the workers' side, they believe that they cannot accept these conditions until the capitalists have made their finances public and implemented democratic management. As a result, several industries and businesses are unable to overcome the current difficulties through labor-capital unity. This estrangement and stalemate are detrimental to both labor and capital.

    In short, due to China's semi-feudal and semi-colonial society, and the Kuomintang reactionary government's long-term inflation after the Anti-Japanese War, China's industries and businesses, generally speaking, are accustomed to surviving under inflation and high prices. Individually speaking, some industries and businesses, their mode of operation and targets are inseparable from a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society. Therefore, in a period of gradual changes in the nature of society, the elimination of some industries and businesses is unavoidable. This can be said to be a clarifying effect in a social transformation process.

    (IV)
    The government will certainly make every effort to deal with the current difficulties of private industry and commerce. At the recent meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, Chairman Mao's instructions and Vice Premier Chen Yun's report clearly pointed out that a large part of the government's financial and economic work in the future will be focused on the adjustment of national industry and commerce, in order to achieve the goal of benefiting both public and private sectors and benefiting both labor and capital. However, this matter is inseparable from the work of changing the nature of Chinese society. Due to the inherent backward factors of private industry and commerce in the past, coupled with the impossibility of fully restoring farmers' purchasing power in the short term, the work of adjustment and transformation will be a long-term affair. Any hasty demands on this work are unreasonable and cannot be accomplished. Industrialists and businessmen across the country should deeply recognize these reasons and combine with the government and labor with the greatest courage and patience to gradually overcome this difficulty together.

    The current difficulties of industry and commerce in various regions have given us many factual lessons. Failure to accept these lessons, that is, refusal to bow to the truth and refusal to transform oneself, will lead to a hopeless future. Therefore, I hope that industrialists and businessmen: First, recognize the characteristics and reasons mentioned above and understand that only by orienting their businesses towards the countryside, towards the interior, and serving the peasant masses practically and genuinely, and winning over this first major customer of the country, can their businesses achieve unlimited development. As pointed out in the above reasons, some factories will not be able to exist in the future unless they are located near raw materials and production areas. Last year, Tianjin held an industrial exhibition, mobilizing thousands of production heroes and labor models from among the farmers to visit the city. These farmers made many suggestions regarding Tianjin's industrial products, allowing Tianjin's industrialists and businessmen not only to know what the farmers needed but also to know that farmers after land reform have considerable purchasing power when the commodities meet their needs. It is estimated that in 1949, the income of farmers in North China from the sale of mountain goods, fruits, and eggs alone averaged ten catties of millet per person. Even taking this item alone for purchase represents a purchasing power that cannot be underestimated. In the current difficulties of industry and commerce in various regions, Beijing and Tianjin not only do not have the same difficulties as Shanghai, but they also have new life in the difficulties. On the one hand, this is basically because the surrounding areas are old areas, but an important reason is that some industrialists and businessmen in Beijing and Tianjin have understood how to face the countryside. Second, industrialists and businessmen should try their best to develop joint organizations in the same industry in the future, and at the same time accept the leadership of the government and state-owned enterprises, in order to minimize the blindness of production. In the future, the government will gradually work to ensure that all five economic components get their due place, as stipulated in Articles 26 and 33 of the Common Program, and organize the main sectors of public and private economies in the overall plan for recovery and development. However, this is not something that can be accomplished overnight. The current problem is to minimize the blindness of private industry and commerce as much as possible, so as not to cause serious losses to the social economy. Third, industrialists and businessmen must recognize that a painful period must be experienced in the process of changing from a semi-feudal and semi-colonial society to a new democratic society, and considerable sacrifices are unavoidable. For example, when the government reverses the financial and economic situation, industry and commerce will feel pain when prices begin to decline steadily. However, the question is whether these measures are reasonable and fundamentally beneficial to industry and commerce. If so, then some pain and some sacrifices should be endured, just like cutting out a malignant tumor. It is impossible not to damage some good flesh and not to bleed. Industrialists and businessmen should know that after this period of pain, it will not be greater pain, but a situation of steady development. Fourth, industrialists and businessmen should remember Chairman Mao's instructions: "Replacing the oppression of foreign imperialism and domestic feudalism with the development of capitalism is not only progress but also an inevitable process. It is not only beneficial to the bourgeoisie but also beneficial to the proletariat. The present China has one more foreign imperialism and one more domestic feudalism, not one more domestic capitalism. On the contrary, our capitalism is too little." That is to say, in a new democratic society, private industry and commerce have broad prospects for development, and the development of private industry and commerce is inseparable from the development of the new democratic society, because it undertakes a very important part of the work of developing production and promoting economic prosperity. In the current difficulties of industry and commerce, some people even say that the government is implementing socialism ahead of schedule. This is completely absurd and does not understand the laws of social development and government policies. Because China will enter socialism in the future after several years of new democratic development. No one can predict how long this period will be. But one thing is certain, this period is quite long, because production cannot be implemented to a certain extent without a certain level of development. An industrialist or businessman should have a clear and correct understanding of this point. Fifth, in the current difficulties of industry and commerce, we have heard some demands from industry and commerce, which is to reduce wages and dismiss workers in order to implement streamlining and economizing. These requirements make some sense from the point of view of maintaining production. But the question is whether there are other unreasonable phenomena on the part of the capitalists that have not been reformed in a timely manner? We can imagine that if only workers are laid off and staff are not streamlined, if only workers' wages are reduced and the wages of a small number of senior staff are not reduced, if all other expenses are not saved, if waste still exists in the factory, if the financial situation is completely hidden from the workers, if no appropriate care is given to the livelihoods of the laid-off personnel, then what methods and what reasons are there to require the workers to accept them unilaterally? Therefore, industrialists and businessmen should consult with labor in everything in the future. Only through this kind of labor-capital consultation can labor be encouraged to improve their labor enthusiasm and share the joys and sorrows with the capitalists. Sixth, according to the above, industrialists and businessmen must recognize the facts, understand the environment, and see the development and hope for the future, restore confidence in the enterprise, and reorganize all forces and put them into production. They must know that favorable conditions are growing, and industrialists and businessmen should not succumb to difficulties. If they endure this period of time, the situation will improve.

　　对于目前私营工商业问题应有的认识
    孙晓村
    （一）
    最近几个月以来，特别是从三月份起，若干地方的若干私营工商业显然是处在一种十分困难的状态中，尤以上海为甚。上海自从春节以来，几乎每天都有私营行庄的停业，工厂商店倒闭、搁浅、停工、减产的事情，有些工厂商店的资方，竟至一走了事，失业工人人数，骤然增加，现在已达十五万人左右。这种情形，我们应当承认是一个大问题。因此，私营工商业问题，在目前已成为全国注意的一个问题，而且已经被提到了急待调整处理的日程上来了。
    对于这个问题，各方面的关心与注意是一致的。但是各方面对于这个问题的看法，因为立场和角度的不同，是有差别的。在这篇文章里，我只想做一种努力，就是想使这种混淆的观念得到澄清。
    （二）
    这次各地工商业所表现出来的困难中，有几点特征：
    第一、这次工商业的困难，虽然范围相当普遍，然而各地的困难程度是极不一致的。一般地说，大城市的困难高过于小城市，而大城市之中，上海尤其突出。如果深入地分析，则凡是这个城市，它周围的农村是经过了土改的区域，那末它所感到的困难比较轻，反过来新区的城市的工商业困难比较来得重，这从京津两地与上海比较上，老区的若干城市与新区的若干城市的比较上，尤其关内与关外的比较上，可以得到有力的证明。如北京、天津固然有一部分工厂商店关闭歇业，但也有不少的工厂商店在三月份甚至四月上旬新开，而且天津三月份新开的工厂，资本比以前增大。这和上海的情形有显著的不同。至于东北，那末今天关内各都市所遭遇着的私营工商业的困难，在东北完全不存在，可见经过土改而且没有战事的区域，确是另有一番景象的。
    第二、上海之所以突出，就因为上海一部分的工商业，过去仅适合于少数特殊阶级的消费的，甚至，可以说是面对帝国主义的。过去一般的情况是，上海所生产的商品，销售于京、津、武汉等大城市，京津武汉所生产的商品，销售于内地的中小城市，内地中小城市所生产的商品则销售于农村。因此，上海与广大农村间的距离是相当远的。故而在解放后要面向农村，也就特别困难。
    第三、上海解放后一年来一直被封锁，而且二月六日遭受敌人的大轰炸，也是使得上海工商业的困难比较突出的原因。
    华北各城市在解放之后由于城乡交流恢复，生产曾经一度上升；现在或多或少遭遇经济萧条的困难，还不致于发现资方弃厂出走的情事。上海的情况就较恶劣，最近就有少数工商业者几乎完全丧失了信心，对于自己的事业，不再坚持维护，只求一走了事，以致整个市场上的信用关系，遭受重大破坏。这是不是说所有出走的资方，他们的事业都已经到了这样山穷水尽的境地呢？事实并不完全如此，因此，除掉少数别有原因者外，这种心理上的变化，是值得注意的。
    第四、这次的困难，虽使工商业者群情惶急，都市生活受到重大影响，而在农村方面，感受到的波动十分轻微，农民正以大力从事农业上的春耕，与水利上的春修。这说明工商业的这次困难是有其本质上的不可避免的因素的。
    （三）
    上面所说的这些特征，告诉我们，对于目前工商业的困难，必须主要的从它本质的分析上，才能作出深刻而正确的认识。这两个月以来，我们听到来自各方面的呼吁与责备，认为这次工商业的困难，主要的是因为税收和公债的征募过重，使工商业的周转资金大大的减少，因而形成了这样搁浅的局面，也有一部分意见，竟认为由于物价稳定得太早而且太快，使工商业对于这突然来到的通货紧缩与物价下降，有措手不及之感。这种非难是不是有理由呢？首先我们应当承认，公债的负担，对于局部的某一家工厂或某一家商店，可能成为使他周转资金因而减少的原因。税收方面，在征收手续上，可能也有些缺点。但这一切，决不会是引起这次工商业困难的主要而且普遍的原因，这在上述特征中可以证明。公债税收全国各城市是普遍征募的，如果这是工商业困难的主要原因，那末各城市的情形何以会有不同，而上海的困难，又何以会这样的突出。其次，物价下降的初期，对于工商业多少是痛苦的。然而从通货膨胀转入收支平衡，这段痛苦是无法避免的，今年不痛苦，明年也要痛苦。而且从长远的全面的利益着想，这对于工商业是有利的。再说物价由下降转入稳定，粮价平疲，利息跌落，开支减少，也为正当工商业在遭受痛苦之后，创造了有利条件。可见，这次工商业的困难，决不是公债税收所引起，而有它基本上的原因的。分析起来：第一、最基本的，因为中国人民经历了一百余年的帝国主义剥削，更长期的封建地主的榨取，以及二十余年的官僚资本的掠夺，再加上长期的战争破坏和灾荒，元气实在是大伤了，广大人民的购买力，是普遍的缺乏。特别在春天，当小麦、丝茧、茶叶、菜籽等尚未登场之前，向来是农民购买力最低落的季节，是商业上的淡月，基本的因素加上季节的影响，使销售市场特别呆滞，城市的工商业因此感受到重大的压力。第二、一部分工商业，在解放以后，没有真正转变方向做到为农村为广大人民而服务。由于转向转业的困难，他们一直还停留在适当旧社会需要的阶段上，时间拖得愈长，亏累也就愈重，所以遇到物价稳步下降，经济日趋正常，投机完全消灭的时候，这类工商业就感到无法支持。第三、过去我们的工业生产，完全是盲目的，如京津两地的火柴厂，可以供给华北农民每人每天消耗八根火柴，而正常的消费量每人每天至多两根半，因此造成了生产过剩的现象。这种盲目生产以致造成过剩的情形，就今天所知道，除了火柴以外，卷烟、面粉、肥皂等业，在各地都有类似的毛病，其他不知道的，一定还有。第四、过去我们工业产销情形，是洋吃华，大吃小，如前所述，帝国主义的商品，以上海为主要市场，上海的商品，以京、津、武汉等城市为主要市场，京、津、武汉的商品，以内地中小城市为主要市场。而过去内地的封建势力，贪污政治，以及连年的战争匪乱，不容许生产事业有丝毫发展的可能的。现在情形改变了，大陆上战争没有了，土匪已经肃清，内地的中小城市，自己也搞起生产来了，而且因为原料方便，工资低廉，取得了不容易竞争的地位，如天津市场上最近所表现出来的两种矛盾情形，一方面面粉业的产品没有销路，而另一方面制造面粉机械的工厂，却生意兴隆，所接各地小城市的定货，据说已定到本年七月份。这种小城市对大城市的抵抗，使大城市的市场大大的缩小，因为大城市的工厂，离原料远，离销区远，而且工资高，费用大，不容易与它竞争的。第五、劳资关系还没有正常，资方所提出的，一是工资太高，二是不能精简节约解雇工人；而在工人方面，认为在资方没有把财政公开，管理实行民主以前，是无法接受的，这样一来，使若干工商业，无法从劳资的团结中，渡过当前的困难，而这种隔膜与僵峙，对于劳资两方都是不利的。
    总之由于中国是半封建半殖民地的社会，抗战以后，国民党反动政府长期的通货膨胀，使中国的工商业，一般的说来，习惯于在通货膨胀物价高涨下取得生存的，个别的说来，有些工商业他们经营的方式和对象，是与半封建半殖民地的社会分不开的。因此在社会性质，逐步改变的时期，一部分工商业的被淘汰，是无法避免的。这在一个社会转变过程中，也可以说是一种澄清的作用。
    （四）
    对于目前私营工商业的困难情形，政府一定会以最大的力量来设法处理的。最近一次中央人民政府委员会开会时，毛主席的指示和陈云副总理的报告，都明白的指出，今后政府的财经工作，将以很大的一部分力量，放在全国工商业的调整上，以达到公私兼顾劳资两利的目的。但这件事是与改变中国社会的性质这一工作分不开的，而由于过去私营工商业的本质上的许多落后的因素，再加上农民购买力的不可能在短期内完全恢复过来。这一项调整与改造的工作，将是一件长时期的事。对于这项工作的任何性急的要求，都是不合理的，而且也无法办到的。全国的工商业者，应当深切的认识这种原因，以最大的勇气和忍耐，来和政府以及劳方结合起来，共同逐步的克服这个困难。
    这次各地工商业的困难，给与我们很多事实的教训。不接受这些教训，也就是说，不肯在真理前面低头，不肯把自己改造过来，那末前途是不会有希望的。因此，我希望工商业者，第一、要认清这些上面所说的特征和原因，了解只有把自己事业面对农村，走向内地，为农民大众切切实实的服务，争取这个全国第一个大主顾，他的事业方可以得到无限的发展。如上面原因中所指出的，今后有些工厂如不就原料就产区，是不容易存在的。去年天津开了一次工业展览会，发动了上千的农民中的生产英雄、劳动模范来进城参观，这些农民对于天津工业生产品，提出了很多的意见，使天津的工商业者，不但知道了农民需要什么，而且知道了土改后的农民，当商品适合他们需要时，他们是有相当购买力的。据估计一九四九年华北农民所卖出来的山货、水果、鸡蛋三种东西的所得，平均每人达十斤小米，单拿这一项来购，就是一分不可轻视的购买力。在这次各地工商业困难中，京津两地不但没有上海这样困难，而且在困难中还有新生。这一方面基本上固然因为周围都是老区，但是京津一部分工商业者，已懂得面对农村，也是一个重要原因。第二、工商业者今后应当在同业方面尽量发展联营的组织，同时接受政府与公营企业的领导，来尽量减少生产的盲目性，政府今后一定会照共同纲领二十六条与三十三条所规定的，逐步地做到，使五种经济成分各得其所，并且把公私经济的主要部门，组织在恢复和发展的总计划中，但这不是一件一蹴就成的事，现在的问题，是在于使私营工商业的盲目性能尽量减少，以免社会经济受到严重的损失。第三、工商业者要认清从半封建半殖民地的社会改变为新民主主义的社会的过程中，一段痛苦的时间，是必须经过的，相当的牺牲，是无法避免的。例如政府扭转财政经济的局面，在物价开始稳步下降时，工商业便感到痛苦。但问题是在于这些措施，是不是合理的，对于工商业基本上是不是有利的，如果是，那末若干痛苦和若干牺牲，是应当忍受的，正如割治一个毒瘤一样，无法不损伤一些好肉而且不流血的。工商业者应当知道，在这段痛苦之后，不会再是更大的痛苦，而是一个稳步发展的局面。第四、工商业者要记着毛主席的指示：“拿发展资本主义去代替外国帝国主义与本国封建主义的压迫，不但是一个进步，而且是一个不可避免的过程，它不但有利于资产阶级，同时也有利于无产阶级。现在的中国是多了一个外国帝国主义与一个本国封建主义，而不是多了一个本国的资本主义，相反地，我们的资本主义是太少了。”这就是说，在新民主主义的社会中，私营工商业有他的广大的发展前途的，而且私营工商业的发展是与新民主主义社会的发展分不开的，因为他担负了发展生产繁荣经济中很重要的一部分工作。在这次工商业的困难中，竟有人说政府是要提早实行社会主义，这完全是不明了社会发展规律与政府政策的无稽之谈。因为中国的将来进入社会主义，是要在经过若干年的新民主主义发展之后，这段时间有多长，谁亦无法预测。但是有一点可以肯定的，这段时间是相当的长，因为生产的发展，不到一定的程度，无法实行社会主义的。一个工商业者，对于这一点，应当要有清楚正确的认识。第五、在这次工商业的困难中，我们听到工商业的一些要求，就是要求减低工资，要求解雇工人，好实行精简节约。这些要求，从维持生产的观点上来说是有一部分道理的。但问题是在于是否资方还有其他不合理的现象，没有及时改革？我们可以设想，假如只解雇工人而不精简职员，假如只减低工人工资，而不减低少数高级职员工资，假若不节约其他的一切开支，假若厂里边还存在着浪费的现象，假若财政情形，对于工人完全讳莫如深，假若不给被解雇的人员以生活上的适当照顾，那未有什么方法并且有什么理由，要工人单面接受呢？所以今后工商业者应当事事与劳方协商，只有通过这种劳资协商，才能使劳方提高劳动情绪，与资方同甘共苦。第六、根据上面所说的，工商业者要认清事实，了解环境，并且看清前途的发展和希望，恢复企业的信心，把一切的力量重新组织起来，投入生产中，要知道有利的条件已在成长，工商业者不应当屈服在困难之前，苦撑过这一段时期，局面就会好转的。
