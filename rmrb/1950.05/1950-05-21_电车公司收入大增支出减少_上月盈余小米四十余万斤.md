　　Electric Tram Company's Income Greatly Increases, Expenditures Decrease
    Last Month's Surplus Equivalent to Over 400,000 Jin of Millet
    [Our Newspaper News] Correspondent Han Zhenxing reports: Starting from the first quarter of this year, the Electric Tram Company has transitioned from a loss to a surplus. Under the leadership of Manager Wang Zhenwu, all employees continue to work hard, igniting a surge in production. In April, the company originally planned to earn 1,185,094 jin of millet, but actually earned 1,428,637 jin of millet. The original planned expenditure was 1,083,180 jin of millet, but the actual expenditure was 953,022 jin of millet. Income exceeded the original target, and expenditures were lower than planned, resulting in an actual surplus of 406,289 jin of millet in April.
    The company's main income is from fares. Due to the consolidation of the circular route, further improvement of other routes, strengthened organizational leadership, and accurate mastery of timing and intervals, the conductor responsibility system has played a certain role. In April, the company originally planned an average of 170 kilometers traveled per car per day, but actually traveled 174 kilometers. The original planned number of passengers per car per day was 1,164, but the actual number completed was 1,210. The original planned daily fare revenue per car was equivalent to 356 jin of millet, but the actual completed was 381 jin.
    As of the end of April, the company's repair shop has completed over 80% of the annual plan for new locomotives. The number of vehicles repaired has exceeded the original four-month plan by 12.8%. The number of locomotives overhauled in April exceeded the monthly production plan by 16.5%, and the number of trailers overhauled exceeded by 29%. Other departments, such as the power plant, substation four plants, and civil engineering department, also overfulfilled their plans.
    The main reason why the company was able to change from a serious loss situation to a surplus is that there was prior planning and monthly summaries, giving all employees a clear goal to strive for. The unity and mutual assistance between employees and workers is an important guarantee for completing the task.
    In order to ensure the completion of the annual production tasks, at the expanded cadre meeting on the 16th, the leadership especially pointed out: Although our company has made money, it is still far from this year's tasks. We hope that all employees will not be arrogant or complacent, and finally put forward four "musts" and four "must nots" as the direction for everyone's efforts. The four "musts" are: 1. Strive to exceed quotas; 2. Develop rationalization proposals; 3. Live frugally; 4. Help each other and unite closely. The four "must nots" are: 1. Do not allow arrogance; 2. Do not allow waste; 3. Do not allow slacking; 4. Do not allow being irresponsible to the people's enterprise for even a moment.

　　电车公司收入大增支出减少
    上月盈余小米四十余万斤
    【本报讯】通讯员韩振兴报道：电车公司于本年第一季度起，已由亏累转入盈余。全体职工在经理王镇武领导下，继续努力，掀起生产热潮。该公司四月份原计划收入一、一八五、○九四斤小米，实际收入小米一、四二八、六三七斤；原计划支出一、○八三、一八○斤小米，实际支出九五三、○二二斤小米。收入超过原定数额，支出较原计划减少，四月份实际盈余四○六、二八九斤小米。
    该公司的主要收入是票款。由于巩固了环行路，进一步改善了其他路线，加强了组织领导，正确地掌握了时间和间隔，使乘务负责制发挥了一定作用。该公司四月份原计划每日每车平均行驶一百七十公里，实际行驶一百七十四公里；原计划每日每车乘客人数一千一百六十四人，实际完成一千二百一十人；原计划每日每车票款收入折米三百五十六斤，实际完成三百八十一斤。
    该公司修造厂截至四月底止，新造机车已完成全年计划的百分之八十强。修造车辆已超出原定四个月计划的百分之一二·八。四月份大修机车超出本月份生产计划的百分之一六·五，大修拖车超出百分之二九。其他如发电厂、变电四厂、土木课等部门，也都超额完成了计划。
    该公司所以能由严重的亏累情况转变到盈余，主要是事先有计划，按月总结，使全体职工有了明确的奋斗目标；职员与工人间的团结互助，是完成任务的重要保障。
    为了保证完成全年生产任务，在十六日的扩大干部会议上，领导上特别指出：我公司虽然赚了钱，可是距今年的任务还很远，希望全体职工且勿骄傲自满，最后提出四要和四不要，作为大家努力的方针。四要是：一、争取超额，二、展开合理化建议，三、精打细算过日子，四、互相帮助，紧密团结。四不要是：一、不允许骄傲，二、不允许浪费，三、不允许怠工，四、不允许一时一刻不对人民的企业负责任。
