Producing in a World of Ice and Snow
A Letter from the People's Liberation Army on the Northeast Frontier

To the Editors:

　　After annihilating the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang on the southern mainland of China, we crossed the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers and arrived on the coldest frontier in northeastern China to accept the new task of building our motherland.

　　When we arrived here after a long journey of thousands of miles in thin clothes, it was more than thirty degrees below zero, and the cold north wind had swollen our hands and faces. But everyone had only one thought: to overcome difficulties and conquer nature.

　　We are engaged in arduous struggle with nature on the deserted grasslands, turning a wilderness of weeds into fertile farmland. The forest has become our home.

　　After more than forty days of active work, only a part of the task has been completed. But seeing that the weather is getting warmer day by day, and the snow is getting less and less, we will soon start production. We ignore all fatigue, work under the stars and moon, rush to build houses, and set fire to burn the weeds. Although everyone's hands are chapped and bleeding from the wind, everyone is still working tirelessly. We are the national defense force of New China, we want to defend the motherland, and we want to participate in economic construction.

　　The comrades who stayed at home are actively transporting manure. They don't have cars, so they borrow them from the villagers. But in order to avoid affecting the production of the villagers, the comrades rush to deliver manure in the dark. The road is difficult to travel, and often requires a round trip of sixty or seventy li, and when they return, the east is already turning white. After a short rest, they send the carts back to the villagers.

　　冰天雪地搞生产
　　东北边疆人民解放军来信编辑同志：
    我们在消灭了中国南部大陆上的蒋介石残余匪帮之后，即跨过长江、黄河，到达了我国东北部最寒冷的边疆上，接受建设祖国的新任务。
    当我们穿着单薄的衣服，经过数千里的长途到达此地时，正是零下三十多度，寒冷的北风把我们的手脸都吹肿了。可是大家只有一个思想：克服困难，战胜自然。
    我们在杳无人迹的草原上和大自然作着艰苦的斗争，要把一片荒草的地方变成肥沃的良田。森林成了我们的家。
    经过四十多天的积极工作，只完成了一部分任务。但是眼看着天气一天比一天温暖了，雪也一天比一天少了，马上就要开始生产了。我们就不顾一切的疲劳，披星戴月，赶建房屋，放火烧荒草。大家的手虽被风吹裂了，而且流了血，可是大家仍然毫不松懈地工作着。我们是新中国的国防军，我们要保卫祖国，我们要参加经济建设。
    留在家里的同志们，则在积极地运粪。他们没有车，就向老乡们借用。但为了避免影响老乡的生产，同志们就在黑夜里赶着送粪。道路又难行，往往要往返六、七十里，回来时东方已放出白色了。休息一会，就给老乡们送车去了。
