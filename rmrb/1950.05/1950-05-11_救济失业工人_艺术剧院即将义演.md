　　Relief for Unemployed Workers
　  Art Theater to Hold Benefit Performance
    [Report from this newspaper] To provide relief to unemployed workers in Shanghai, the Beijing People's Art Theater will hold three benefit performances at the Zhongshan Park Music Hall on the 13th and 14th of this month (Saturday evening, Sunday afternoon and evening). The program includes orchestral music, military music, chorus, solo vocal performances, solo instrumental performances, lantern dances, silk dances, flag dances, stick dances, and small song and dance dramas such as "Boasting About the Son-in-Law" and "The Whole Family is Glorious." Ticket sales will begin on the 11th of this month at the Music Hall. All proceeds from the performances, excluding necessary expenses, will be donated to unemployed workers in Shanghai. We hope that people from all walks of life will actively purchase tickets and reserve seats to support this worthy cause.
