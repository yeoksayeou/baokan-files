　　Actively Implement the Directives of the Financial and Economic Committee
    Comprehensive Survey of Industrial and Mining Enterprises in Northeast and Northwest China
    [Our Newspaper] In order to implement the directive of the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government on conducting a unified national census of all state-owned, joint state-private, and industrial production cooperatives' industrial and mining enterprises, the Northeast and Northwest regions have made specific arrangements for the census. The Northeast People's Government has instructed the People's Economic Planning Committee to uniformly plan the census of state-owned, joint state-private, and cooperatively managed industrial and mining enterprises throughout Northeast China. This census will use 1949 as the reference point and will survey all dynamic and static items of each enterprise, including the general overview of the enterprise, various equipment, consumption of raw materials and fuel, factory buildings and workshops, mining conditions, employees and working hours and wages, production items, and construction projects, totaling eight departments and fifteen forms. The Northeast Statistics Bureau, together with the Ministry of Industry, as well as the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Finance, the Shenyang Municipal Government, and the Northeast Cooperative General Society, which manage more industrial and mining enterprises, have formed a joint working committee to report and inspect the progress of the census work at any time and to solve the difficulties encountered in the work process. The Liaoxi Provincial Government has also organized a census working group to assist the work of various factories and mines.
    The Northwest Financial and Economic Committee convened a symposium on April 29, bringing together responsible persons from relevant departments, to determine that after receiving the forms, each enterprise unit must be led by its head, immediately designate a special person to work with relevant personnel to first study and correctly understand the instructions and contents of the forms, and then truthfully fill them out in accordance with the various regulations, and must complete the task on schedule. The symposium also determined that the filling out of forms by enterprise units at the level of the Northwest Greater Administrative Region should be directly led by the respective departments in charge. In addition to ordering the financial and economic committees of various provinces and cities to actively deploy in accordance with regulations, the Northwest Financial and Economic Committee has now completed the deployment work for the filling out of forms by units directly under the various departments in the area.
