　　Tianjin Industrial and Commercial Businesses Actively Pay Taxes
    April Tax Revenue Exceeds Target
    [This Newspaper] According to the Tianjin Municipal Tax Bureau's April work report: Tianjin's tax revenue work achieved great results in April. Estimated tax revenue can be converted to 80 million catties of rice, exceeding the predetermined target by more than 6 million catties. The focus of Tianjin's tax revenue work in April was to concentrate efforts on collecting the private industrial and commercial tax for the second half of 1949. Therefore, after the Tianjin Municipal Consultative Committee and the Government Committee's second joint meeting passed the "Work Outline" on March 25th, various meetings were held separately for publicity and mobilization. The bean sprouts, fruit, and bicycle industries proposed a challenge competition to all industries in the city after the first meeting. Many group leaders and committee members also proposed changing the original 35 catties of millet per share to 40 catties. After consideration by the leadership, in order to take into account the current difficulties of industry and commerce, each share was still calculated at 35 catties. As a result, the enthusiasm of various industries was even higher, so that the number of industrial and commercial tax shares not only did not decrease due to the closure of some industrial and commercial households, but increased instead. For example, the original task of 2 million shares was reduced to 1.89 million shares due to the closure of some industrial and commercial households. However, in order to ensure income, the shares after the increase in various industries reached 2,351,136.84 shares. After a general reduction of 5%, there were still 2,235,132.48 shares. A total of 51,158 shares were reduced for 29 industries with more difficulties, and a total of 9,660 shares were increased for individual industries with fewer recognized shares and better business. Therefore, the actual number of shares was 2,193,634.48 shares, equivalent to 76,777,206.80 catties of rice. Adding the eleven individual households and small households taxed by grading and classification, and deducting the industrial and commercial tax exemptions, it should be no less than 80 million catties. After more than 20 days of intense work, as of April 24th, the amount deposited in the treasury had reached 86,618,387 catties of millet. Together with the 13,996,915 catties supplemented for 1949, the total was 100,615,302 catties.
    The main reasons for achieving the above results are firstly that most of the 159 cadres participating in this work (27 fewer than last time) had done industrial and commercial tax collection work before, so the work started step by step, starting from in-depth publicity and implementation of policies, and paying close attention to fairness and reasonableness in the burden. More importantly, it was closely integrated with newspapers, radio stations, and relevant departments. For example, at the beginning of the work, there were almost daily reports in the newspapers. Twelve industries broadcast on the radio, which kept the enthusiasm of merchants in various industries high. The situation of consciously and voluntarily recognizing shares and paying taxes was also more common and widespread. Secondly, in the upsurge of democratic appraisal, more than 1,000 activists emerged in various industries due to the active enlightenment of the cadres, playing a leading role and ensuring the completion of the task.
    The issues that the Tianjin Municipal Tax Bureau should pay attention to in the future in balancing the burden and protecting and developing industry and commerce are: (1) How to plan and organize the training of these existing activists to become strong assistants in future work. (2) Promoting the method of democratic appraisal further towards the direction of self-reporting, actual payment, combined with checking accounts and calculating taxes according to rates.

### 天津工商户踊跃纳税  四月份入库税额超过预定任务

　　天津工商户踊跃纳税
    四月份入库税额超过预定任务
    【本报讯】据津市税务局四月份工作报告：天津市四月份税收工作获得很大成绩，预计入库税款可折米达八千万斤，超过预定任务六百余万斤。四月份津市税收工作重点在集中力量征收一九四九年下半年的私营工商业税，故在三月二十五日各界协商委员会及政府委员会二次联席会通过“工作大纲”后，即分别召开各种会议作宣传动员，豆食、果子、自行车三业即在第一次会议后便提出向全市各行业挑战竞赛。并有不少小组长委员提议将原定业分每分从三十五斤小米改为四十斤。后经领导上考虑结果，为照顾目前工商业困难，每分仍按三十五斤计算。至此各行业情绪更加高涨，使这次工商业税分数不但未因有部分工商户歇业而有所减少，反而增加了。如原来二百万分的任务后因有的工商户歇业，只剩一百八十九万余分。但为保证收入，经各业增分后的业分达到二、三五一、一三六·八四分，后经普遍核减百分之五后，仍有二、二三五、一三二·四八分。对困难较多的二十九个行业共减五一、一五八分，对个别认分少而营业较好的行业共增九、六六○分，故实际分数是二、一九三、六三四·四八分，折米七六、七七七、二○六·八○斤，加上十一个个别户及分等分级征收的小户，减去工商业税应减免部分，当不下于八千万斤。经过二十余天的紧张工作，迄至四月二十四日止，入库数字已达到八六、六一八、三八七斤小米，连增补一九四九年的一三、九九六、九一五斤，则共计为一○○、六一五、三○二斤。
    获致以上成绩的主要原因首先是参加这次工作的一五九个干部（比上次少二七人）大部是已做过工商业税征收工作的，所以工作一开始即按步就班，从深入宣传贯彻政策着手，并切实注意做到负担上的公平合理。更重要的是与报纸、电台及有关部门的密切结合。譬如工作一开始，报上几乎每天都有报道。到电台上广播的就有十二个行业，使各行业商户情绪保持了高涨。自觉自愿认分纳税的情况也较普遍而广泛。其次并在民主评议的热潮中，由于干部的积极启发，各行业中涌现了一千多名积极分子，起了带头作用，保证了任务的完成。
    今后津市税务局在平衡负担保护和发展工商业上，应注意的问题是：（一）如何有计划和有组织地去培养已有的这些积极分子，成为今后工作中强有力的助手。（二）使民主评议的方法推进一步向自报实缴配合查账依率计征的方向发展。
