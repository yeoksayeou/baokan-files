　　Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party Sends Condolences to Joliot-Curie
　　Protests the French Government's Behavior of Appeasing American Imperialism
    [Report from this newspaper] The Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party recently sent a telegram of condolences to Joliot-Curie. The telegram reads as follows: Professor Joliot-Curie:
    The reactionary French government, in order to please its master – the American imperialists – has brazenly dismissed you from your positions as a member of the Atomic Energy Control Committee and High Commissioner for Atomic Energy. Peace-loving and democratic people all over the world are in the midst of anger, making solemn protests to the reactionary French government, and extending our respectful condolences to you.
    The 450 million people of China have already been closely united around the great leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, and are carrying out the historical task of defending lasting world peace. Recently, we have been more widely and enthusiastically responding to the signature campaign to completely ban atomic weapons and defend world peace, uniting with the laboring and peace-loving people of the world, led by the Soviet Union, to forge a strong force to respond to all the ugly and violent acts of reactionary groups. Let us offer you our highest respects and condolences!
