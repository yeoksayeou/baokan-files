　　Emergency Repairs to Pukou Wharf
　　By our reporter Yong Jin
　　In Pukou, on the opposite bank of the Yangtze River from Nanjing in the lower reaches, a huge water conservancy construction project of historical significance is currently underway. The completion of this project is related to the land transportation between the north and south banks of the Yangtze River in East China, and is particularly important for the supply of coal to Shanghai and other places.
　　The danger of Pukou Wharf lies in the collapse caused by the scouring of the river water. The main reason for the collapse and scouring of Pukou Wharf is that the Kuomintang reactionaries have not dredged or repaired the Yangtze River for many years, causing the Yangtze River to silt up a kilometer-long sandbar—Baisha Island—five miles above Pukou. The river water is divided into two mainstreams here. These two mainstreams form a large whirlpool below Baisha Island, directly impacting Pukou. Under such circumstances, Pukou gradually fell into the water. By the time of liberation in April last year, six of the ten wharves in Pukou had collapsed. A main street along the river had also mostly collapsed into the river. The only ferry wharf for north-south transportation was also under serious threat from the river water. In the past, the Kuomintang reactionaries never cared about such disasters. An engineer in the area told the reporter that the materials left by the Japanese puppet regime for the construction of the wharf were used by those officials of the Kuomintang reactionaries to build a grand Sichuan Restaurant on Xin Jie Kou in Nanjing after they took over.
　　The Pukou Wharf project is huge. It is huge because it is necessary to remove this Baisha Island to shift the mainstream of the Yangtze River to the center of the river, so that it will no longer impact Pukou or the Jiangnan riverbank in Xiaguan. This suggestion was proposed by Soviet experts. This proposal is a fundamental solution to the danger of Pukou.
　　The dredging project is underway in the heart of the river northwest of Nanjing, stretching 3.6 kilometers from Baisha Island to Pukou Station. It is planned to dredge a total of six million cubic meters of mud. It is quite difficult to carry out such a huge dredging project at the bottom of the vast river. However, the workers and technicians are overcoming these difficulties and carrying out arduous work. Now, many large red and green oil drums are floating in the center of the calm river surface, which are the signs of dredging the river flow. There are forty-two dredgers on this section of the project, mainly including Jianshe, Haihu, Hailong, Haixiang, Haikun, and Hai’e. Among the dredgers, Jianshe is responsible for 60% of the dredging tasks. The employees on the dredgers are working tirelessly from morning to night, and from night to dawn. During the day, the wide river surface is covered with the black smoke emitted by the dredging ships; at night, it is brightly lit, and the sound of Haixiang’s mud spraying and Jianshe’s drainage can be heard from several miles away. The crew members here told me that the intensity of their current work is the first time in their lives. In the past, crew members always had to rest ashore, get water, and coal every day. Now, small boats are used to send coal and water to the dredgers. Now the crew members take turns in three shifts, and no time is wasted on the use of the ship. Some crew members work up to twenty hours. Due to their intense work, the dredging work has achieved great results. When the construction started in February, the Jianshe only dredged 12,000 to 13,000 cubic meters per day; in April, they dredged 35,000 cubic meters per day. Hailong, Haihu, Hai’e, Haixiang, Haikun and other ships have also achieved brilliant records. Most of these ships were previously controlled by reactionary forces. Once they are in the hands of the people, they will fully exert their positive role. Now, a savings campaign is being launched on each ship to overcome difficulties and complete tasks. When the ship's machinery fails, they always try to repair it themselves, instead of dragging it to the shore or dock for repair as in the past. Now, Jianshe is leading the savings campaign. In January and February, the Jianshe used 70 tons of coal per day, 50 tons in April, and now only burns 46 or 47 tons. In the past, four furnaces could not burn to 200 pounds of gas, but now three furnaces can burn to 200 pounds, which has initially met their own requirements: saving money and dredging more mud. The mud they dug out of the river has raised the transportation wharf area by ten meters.
　　Another huge task being carried out here is quarrying and transporting willow branches. In order to strengthen the firmness of Pukou Wharf, Pukou Wharf must be made into a stone revetment. The stones used for the revetment are quarried from the Shili Changshan of Yanzi Rock and the mountains of Chu County. In February and March this year, the quarrying workers on the two mountains set off explosives. At 12 noon and 5 pm every day, the sound of fierce artillery fire like in war could be heard. Brave workers often tied ropes around their waists and carried out the work of chiseling stone holes and installing explosives in the middle of the mountain. The Jinpu Railway train and more than 50 ships are still continuing to transport stones from Yanzi Rock and Chu County Mountain. People who participated in throwing stones in Pukou include the People's Liberation Army stationed locally, and the liberated Kuomintang military officers who are still studying. Due to the intense labor of all personnel participating in the construction project, a low and solid embankment that can withstand the scouring of the river has now appeared on the collapsed Pukou riverbank.
　　In order to make the river bank protection better, the work of sinking dragons must also be carried out here. In the square west of the shipyard, there are piles of willow branches like mountains. From the source of these willow branches, you can see the vastness of the construction here. These willow branches come from northern Jiangsu, southern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, southern Anhui, and as far as Hunan, more than 2,000 miles away. It takes 18 days to transport them from Dongting Lake to Nanjing, and it takes more than ten days to transport willow branches upstream from Yangzhou in northern Jiangsu. The people transporting the willow branches are working in continuous rainy weather. On the twelve Hunan ships that have arrived in Pukou, the willow branch transport crew members also showed a high degree of work enthusiasm. Crew members Chen Yunsheng and 68-year-old Li Huayun said: We will transport even if it is difficult. When the country is built well, we will not be difficult. From this, we can see the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people for the construction of the motherland. In the dragon binding field with more than 300 people, the hands of most of the dragon binding workers were worn out by the iron wire, but the upsurge of work is still developing. In the field, this group and that group ask each other about the number of dragons bound, to see who binds the most. The general group’s dragon binding work has increased from 25 per day to 35, or even 40. Many of these dragon binding and stone transport workers are unemployed Pukou dock workers who were unemployed before liberation. They work with unprecedented selfless enthusiasm, because they understand the benefits of the construction of Pukou Wharf to them. This is the need of the country and also their own needs. Their work is not only for today, but also for tomorrow.

　　抢修浦口码头
    本报记者　勇进
    在长江下游南京对岸的浦口，现在正进行着一件有历史意义地巨大的水利建设工程。这个工程的完成与否，关系着华东区长江南北的陆路交通，目前对上海等地煤炭的供应尤关重要。
    浦口码头之危险，在于江水冲刷所造成的塌陷现象。浦口码头所以塌陷与被冲刷的主要原因，是由于国民党反动政府历年来对长江没有疏浚与修建，使长江在浦口以上五里的地方淤成长一公里的沙洲—白沙洲，江水在此分为两个主流，这两个主流在白沙洲的下面，形成一大旋涡，直冲浦口。浦口在这样的情况下，逐步陷落入水。到去年四月解放时止，浦口的十个码头陷落了六个。沿江的一条大街也大部的倒在江中了。南北交通唯一的轮渡码头，也处于江水的严重威胁之下。过去，国民党反动派对于这样的灾难是从不关心的。该地的一位工程师告诉记者，这里在日伪时代所留下来修建码头的材料，国民党反动派接收后，被那些官员们在南京的新街口修了一座规模宏大的蜀中饭店。
    浦口码头工程是巨大的。它之所以巨大，是因为要挖掉这个白沙洲，使长江主流移至江心，不再冲击浦口也不冲击下关江岸。这个意见是苏联专家提议的。这个提议是根本解决浦口危险的办法。
    疏浚工程正在南京西北面的江心进行着，从白沙洲到浦口车站共三·六公里，预定挖泥共为六百万公方。在广阔的江底从事这样的巨大挖泥工程，是有相当困难的。但工人们与技师们正克服着这些困难进行艰巨的工作。现在，平静的江面的中心，漂浮着许多红绿色的大油桶，这就是疏浚江流的标志。在这段工程上，有四十二只挖泥船，其中主要是建设、海虎、海龙、海象、海鲲、海鳄等号。而建设号在挖泥船中，又担负了百分之六十的挖泥任务。挖泥船上的员工们，从早晨到夜晚，从夜晚到天明，总是在不息的工作着。白天，宽阔的江面上，笼罩着挖泥轮船所喷出的黑烟；入夜即是灯火辉煌，数里外都可以听到海象号的喷泥与建设号的排水声响。这里的船员们告诉我，他们现在的工作时间的紧张情形，是他们有生以来第一次。过去船员每天总要靠岸休息、上水、上煤。现在都是用小船往挖泥船上送煤、送水。现在船员们分三班轮流，对于船的使用，一分钟的时间也不浪费。有的船员作到二十个钟头的工作。由于他们紧张的工作，挖泥工作获得了巨大的成绩。二月份刚开工时，建设号每日只挖到一万二千公方到一万三千多公方；在四月份，他们每天挖到三万五千公方。海龙、海虎、海鳄、海象、海鲲等号，也同样的获得光辉的纪录。这些船只，过去绝大部分掌握在反动势力手中，一旦为人民所掌握，便充分地发挥了积极作用。现在在各船上正开展着战胜困难，完成任务的节约运动。当船上的机器发生故障的时候，他们总是自己尽量的修理，而不是像过去拖到岸边或船坞里修理。现在以建设号为首正开展着节约运动。一、二月份，建设号每日用煤七十吨，四月份为五十余吨，现在只烧四十六七吨。过去四个炉还烧不到二百磅气，现在三个炉也可烧到二百磅，已初步的达到他们自己的要求：又节约又多挖泥。他们从江心挖出来的泥，已将交通码头地带填高了十公尺。
    在这里所进行的另一巨大工作，即是开山与运柳条。为了加强浦口码头的牢固性，必须将浦口码头作成石护岸。护岸所用的石头，是燕子矶的十里长山与滁县山上所开采来的。在今年二月与三月间，两山的开山工人们点起了炸药，每天的中午十二时与下午五时，可以听到有如战争中激烈的炮火的声响。勇敢的工人们时常将绳子缚在自己的腰间，在半山中进行凿石眼装炸药的工作。津浦路的列车与五十多只船，现在还继续运输燕子矶与滁县山采来的石头。在浦口参加投石的人们，有驻在当地的人民解放军，及被解放的还在学习中的国民党军官。由于参加修建工程的所有人员的紧张劳动，现在在已塌陷的浦口江岸，已出现了矮矮的稳固的能够经受得起江流冲刷的江堤。
    为把江护岸做得更好，在这里还需进行沉龙工作。在造船场西边的广场上，堆积着如山的柳条，从这些柳条的来源上，你可看到这里工程建筑的浩大。这些柳条是来自苏北、苏南、皖北、皖南及远达两千余里的湖南，从洞庭湖到南京十八天才可运到，从苏北的扬州逆流运柳也须十多天以上。运柳的人们在连绵的阴雨天进行。在已经到达浦口的十二只湖南船上，运柳的船员们同样表现出高度的工作热情，船员陈云生及六十八岁的李华云说：我们再困难也要运，国家建设好了，我们就不困难了。从这里可以看到广大人民对祖国的建设热情。在三百多人的捆龙场里，捆龙工人的手大多被铁丝磨破了，但工作的热潮还在开展着。场子里这个小组与那个小组互相询问捆龙的数目，看谁捆的多。一般组的捆龙工作，已从每天二十五个增加到三十五个，甚至四十个。这些捆龙及运石工人中，不少是解放前失业的浦口码头工人，他们以空前的忘我的热情工作着，因为他们懂得浦口码头的修建工作对他们的好处，这是国家的需要，也是他们自己的需要，他们的工作不只是为了今天，而且是为了明天。
