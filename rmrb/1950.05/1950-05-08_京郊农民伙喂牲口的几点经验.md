　　Several Experiences of Farmers in the Suburbs of Beijing in Group Feeding Livestock
　　Shi Wei
　　Farmers in the suburbs of Beijing have been allocated some livestock during the land reform. Due to the small number of livestock, most are fed in groups. The largest group is twenty-eight households, the smallest is two households, and the average is five or six households raising one animal together. Recently, the Beijing Suburban Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party conducted a focused survey on the situation of 120 livestock raised by farmers in groups in six villages, including Shuanghuaishu, Heita, Baipenyao, Gaolizhuang, Shibalidian, and Shigezhuang. It was found that 49 animals were fatter than before the land reform, 39 were in average condition, 12 were thinner, and 2 died. From this situation, several experiences and lessons were learned.

　　First, it should be clearly recognized that group feeding of livestock is a form of cooperation and mutual assistance based on private property. Farmers participating in group feeding of livestock should clearly recognize that they have a share in the livestock, only then can the livestock be well-fed in the group. The owners of the above-mentioned 49 fattened livestock all had this understanding. On the contrary, in Liangjiadian Natural Village, the four livestock and two carts that were distributed were combined to form a production department for engaging in sideline production, and four additional people were hired to drive the carts. These four people did not take good care of the livestock because it was not their own. The general farmers also believed that the livestock was owned by the production department collectively, and no one cared whether it was well-fed or not. As a result, one mule died in forty days, and the remaining three were also thin.

　　Second, livestock fed by freely formed groups are generally fed very well. Groups formed by relatives, friends, or households in the same farmers' association group, because of the emotional foundation of relatives and friends, can be mutually accommodating and helpful when sharing fodder and using livestock, and can work together to solve difficulties. Conversely, in Gaolizhuang, six households fed a mule together. Because they did not form the group voluntarily, no one wanted to contribute more when sharing fodder. The mule was not fed enough and has become emaciated.

　　Third, fodder should be distributed according to land acreage. Because the farmers feeding livestock in groups have different acreages of land, and the use of animal power in paddy fields and dry land is also different, most groups adopt the method of distributing fodder according to land acreage. For example, in Shigezhuang, five households feeding a mule together stipulate that every half month, three catties of grass and one catty of wheat bran should be distributed per mu. In Shuanghuaishu Village, most farmers feeding livestock in groups stipulate that the ratio of fodder distribution for dry land, irrigated land, and vegetable garden land is 1:2:3. Everyone feels that these methods are fair and reasonable, and they automatically take out fodder according to the regulations. The livestock does not lack food and is well-fed.

　　Fourth, there must be a dedicated person to feed the livestock. Entrust the responsibility of feeding the livestock to households with experience in feeding livestock and with livestock housing. Give them a certain price, and they can feed the livestock well. Chang Wanchun and two other households in Baipen often have a black donkey, and Chang is solely responsible for feeding it. Chang's son has experience in feeding livestock, cuts the grass finely, does not "lazily feed" the livestock, adds fodder in small amounts at a time, mixes the feed evenly, and adds fodder five or six times at night. He also provides fixed water three times a day and loads a certain amount according to the livestock's physical strength when driving the cart. His family also has livestock housing, and the manure accumulated by the livestock is his reward. Therefore, the livestock is getting fatter and fatter. However, the "rotating official horse" feeding method adopted by Wang Jinshan and other four households, where they take turns feeding and using the livestock, only paying attention to using the livestock and collecting manure, made the mule thinner day by day.

　　Fifth, there should not be too many households feeding in a group, and the land acreage should not exceed the ability to cultivate. Generally, three to five households feeding a livestock together is appropriate. The land of all households combined must be able to be cultivated by the livestock (generally, one mule is suitable for cultivating 60 to 80 mu of dry land or 15 to 20 mu of paddy field). For example, in Gaolizhuang, Xuan Yushan and other six households fed a mule together. The six families have a total of 67.1 mu of dry land and 19.17 mu of paddy field. One mule cannot cultivate all of it, and everyone often quarrels over the use of the livestock. When it is someone's turn to use it, they disregard the livestock's fatigue, and the mule becomes thinner and thinner.

　　Sixth, sideline production must be carried out during slack farming seasons so that the livestock can support themselves. Farmers who have been allocated livestock during the land reform mostly lack capital. Therefore, during the gaps in slack farming seasons, livestock should be used for sideline production to solve the difficulty of fodder. Sideline production requires large carts, and cooperation with households with carts can better feed the livestock. Therefore, how to coordinate livestock and carts for sideline production is a positive direction and method for solving the fodder and other difficulties faced by farmers feeding livestock in groups.

　　京郊农民伙喂牲口的几点经验
    史威
    京市郊区农民在土地改革中，分得了部分牲口。由于牲口少，大部是伙喂的。最多是二十八户，最少是二户，一般是五、六户伙养一头。日前中共北京郊区工作委员会有重点的调查了双槐树、黑塔、白盆窑、高立庄、十八里店、史各庄等六个村农民伙喂的一百二十头牲口的情况，发现其中较土地改革前喂肥了的有四十九头，喂得平常的三十九头，喂瘦了的十二头，喂死的二头。从这一情况中，找出了几点经验教训。
    首先，应该明确认识，伙喂牲口是在私有财产基础上的合作互助。应该使参加伙喂牲口的农民，明确认识牲口有自己一份，如此牲口才能伙喂好。上述四十九头喂肥了的牲口主，都有这种认识。相反的，如亮甲店自然村，将分得的四头牲口和两辆大车，结合起来，组成生产部，搞副业生产，另雇四人赶车。这四个人因牲口不是自己的，不好好照料。一般农民又认为牲口是生产部公有的，喂好喂坏大家都不管，结果四十天中就死了一头骡子，其余三头也都瘦了。
    其次，凡自由结组伙喂的牲口，一般都喂得很好。亲友或同在一个农会小组的几户结成一组，因为有亲友情感作基础，在摊草料和使用牲口时，便能互让互助，有困难也能协力解决。相反的高立庄有六户伙喂一头骡子，因不是自愿结组，摊草料时，谁也不愿多拿，骡子吃不饱，已瘦弱不堪。
    第三，应该按地亩摊草料。伙喂牲口的农民，因各户土地亩数不同，水旱地使用畜力也不同，因此多数组都是采取按地亩摊草料的办法。如史各庄五户伙喂一头骡子，规定每半月每亩摊三斤草一斤麸子。双槐树村多数伙喂牲口的农民，规定旱地、水浇地、菜园地摊草料的比率是旱地一、水浇地二、菜园地三，这些办法大家都感到公平合理，自动的按规定拿出草料，牲口不缺吃的，就都喂的很肥。
    第四，必须要有专人喂养。把喂牲口的责任交给有喂牲口经验和有牲口房的户。大家给他一定代价，可以把牲口喂好。白盆常万春等三户，伙有一头黑驴，由常万春专责喂养，常的儿子喂牲口有经验，草切的细，喂牲口不“懒槽”，一次不多添，料拌的匀，夜里还要添五、六次草料，每天固定饮水三次，赶车时按牲口的体力大小装一定份量。他家也有喂牲口房子，牲口积下的粪作为他的报酬，因此牲口愈来愈肥。而王斤山等四户所采取的“轮官马”的喂法，轮着喂、轮着使，大家只注意使牲口、落粪，骡子一天比一天瘦了。
    第五，伙喂户不可太多，地亩不能超过耕种的能力。一般的以三、五户伙喂一头牲口为合适。各户土地合在一起，必须牲口耕种得了（一般的一头骡子以耕种旱地六十亩至八十亩，水地十五亩至二十亩为宜）。如高立庄轩玉山等六户，伙喂一头骡子，六家共有旱地六十七亩一分、水地十九亩一分七，一头骡子种不了，大家常为争使牲口吵架。轮到谁使时，就不顾牲口的疲劳，骡子愈来愈瘦。
    第六，在农暇时必须搞副业生产，使牲口能够自养。土地改革中分到牲口的农民，大多缺乏垫本，因此在农闲的空隙中，要使牲口搞副业生产以解决草料的困难。搞副业生产需要大车，与有车户配合，牲口就能养的更好。因此如何使牲口和车配合搞副业生产，是解决农民伙喂牲口的草料及其他困难的一个积极的方向与办法。
