　　Convene Branch Work Symposium to Study Guaranteeing and Supervising Production
　　Anshan Municipal Party Committee Organization Department

　　Editor's Note: At a time when most factory branches do not have a mature set of experiences in guaranteeing and supervising production, the approach of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee Organization Department is very good. The result of doing so can quickly disseminate and adopt advanced experiences. The Organization Department of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee suggests that all municipal party committees, industrial party committees, and large factory and mine party committees in the Northeast adopt Anshan's method, holding such a meeting once a month to summarize the experience of the branches and introduce typical cases, so as to give factory branch workers specific guidance in order to improve their work. The report of the Anshan Municipal Party Committee Organization Department is now published for the reference of party committees in various places.

　　In February, the branches were reorganized, the number of branches increased, and the branch secretaries were all new. In March, the Anshan Municipal Party Committee Organization Department held a branch work symposium for four and a half days. It was not a very good meeting, but some problems were discovered.

　　There was more discussion on the question of how the branch can guarantee and supervise production. A few branches have done better, such as the coking plant branch of the Chemical Industry Department, the forging workshop branch of the Heavy Machinery Plant, the machine repair plant branch of the Capital Construction Department, and the North Plant branch of the Refractory Plant. The common experience is to focus on solving the key problems in production. This is the main link of branch work, that is, the branch must know every month and every hour what the main obstacles to completing and exceeding the production tasks are, and use this as the starting point of the Party's work, mobilizing the Party members to educate the masses. For example, the Soviet experts of the coking plant proposed a task of 2,200 tons per day, which the coking plant had never achieved before. At the same time, there were many difficulties in production, mainly the blockage of the ascension pipe flue. The branch immediately studied a method to clean the ascension pipe without affecting production, which was accepted by the administration. Under the leadership of the Party members, the work task was completed ahead of schedule, and the production in March was greatly improved. For example, the production task of the Heavy Machinery Forging Workshop in March was completely impossible to achieve under the original working conditions. After research, the branch came up with a method of early fire, led by Party members, and mobilized all workers to exceed the production task in March. According to the poor quality of magnesia bricks, the North Plant branch of the Refractory Plant came up with specific methods to check and guarantee the quality, which improved the quality of magnesia bricks. In addition, the machine repair plant branch studied the unreasonable phenomena in production that hinder the further improvement of production, such as too many old technicians leaving production and organizational chaos, and put forward opinions to the administration, improved the leadership of production, and improved the output. Such branches have already explored the working methods of the branch. They start from the main links of production and know how to use the organizational strength of the Party and promote the masses through the trade union and the Communist Youth League. Therefore, their relationship between the Party, the government, the trade union and the Communist Youth League is also well coordinated, the relationship between the Party and the masses has been improved, and the prestige of the Party among the masses has been improved. At present, there are not many such branches.

　　Most branches still do not know how to use the Party's organizational strength to solve the main links in production work, and have not really experienced how to guarantee and supervise production. They just hold meetings as usual, and general self-criticism cannot solve many problems. A few branches have a wrong understanding of guaranteeing and supervising production. Some people put production work and Party work in opposition, thinking that they cannot do both well. For example, the Third Branch of the Heavy Machinery Plant believes that the administration is doing well, but the branch work is ruined. Some branches do not separate the Party and the government. For example, the director of the pipe fitting factory of the Basic Construction Department is also the branch secretary. The administrative work is discussed, decided, and arranged at the branch meeting. Some branches believe that the Party's supervisory role is to have Party members monitor the masses, and the things decided by the branch should be implemented by the masses, and if the masses do not implement it, the Party members will point the finger.

　　The following points have been experienced in guaranteeing and supervising production:

　　1. Guaranteeing and supervising production is the basic task of the Party branch (and also the Party committee). Only by starting from this point and doing this work well can other work be easily solved. The Party shows its strength and role in production, and the cadres who do administrative work will rely closely on the branch. The prestige of the Party among the masses has been improved, and the Party can be further improved and consolidated.

　　2. Many of the workshop branch secretaries or group leaders of the workshop groups are part-time directors or class leaders of the administration. They are all old technicians, have prestige among the workers, and are familiar with Party members and the masses. Therefore, such branches often do better. When production tasks come or encounter difficulties, they first mobilize the strength of the Party, and then mobilize the masses. The relationship between the Party, the government, and the trade union is naturally reflected.

　　3. The role of the Party in guaranteeing and supervising production is almost always well done in production units where workers can master the production process; in factories with complex technology (such as steel plants), the technology is completely controlled by technicians, and we have no Party members among the technicians, and we have not done a good job in the work of the technicians, so it is difficult for the branch there to play a role in guaranteeing production.

　　4. It is very important to divide the branches according to the workshop, and for branches with many Party members, divide them into branch branches according to shifts in continuous production departments, and organize groups according to types of work (such as the primary rolling mill, which divides each of the three shifts of A, B, and C into branch branches, and divides the groups according to types of work such as heating, rolling, and shearing in a branch branch). At the same time, it is very important to put the focus of the Party's work on the workshop branch, only in this way can the Party's life and work be enriched and active, and can the role of the Party be brought into play.

　　According to the situation of this symposium, the Anshan Municipal Party Committee Organization Department convened a meeting of more than 100 branch secretaries of the entire Anshan Iron and Steel Company to talk about how the branch can guarantee and supervise production and the leadership methods of the branch, which was helpful to the new branch secretaries. In the future, it is planned to convene one or two meetings of all branch secretaries every month, and invite the branches that have done well to make typical reports.

### 召开支部工作座谈会研究保证与监督生产

　　召开支部工作座谈会研究保证与监督生产
    鞍山市委组织部
    编者按：在大多数工厂支部对保证与监督生产还没有一套成熟经验的时候，鞍山市委组织部的这种作法是很好的。这样做的结果，可以使先进的经验很快地传播并被采用。中共中央东北局组织部建议东北所有市委、产业党委与大工厂矿山党委都采用鞍山这个办法，每月召开一次这样的会议，总结支部的经验并介绍典型，给工厂支部工作者以具体的指导，以便改进工作。现将鞍山市委组织部的报道发表，供各地党委参考。
    于二月份整理了支部，支部增加了，支部书记又都是新的，在三月份鞍山市委组织部开了一次支部工作座谈会，开了四个半天，开的不算很好，也发现了些问题。
    关于支部如何保证与监督生产的问题讨论较多。有少数支部作的较好，如化工部的炼焦厂支部、重机厂的锻造场支部、基建处的机修厂支部、耐火厂北场支部等，共同的经验是把主要精力放在解决生产上的关键问题。这就是支部工作的主要环节，即是支部每月每时要知道完成与超过生产任务的主要障碍是什么，以此作为党的工作的出发点，动员党内教育群众，如炼焦厂苏联专家提出每天二千二百吨的任务，这是炼焦厂从未达到过的，同时生产上有很多困难，主要是上升管烟道堵塞。支部即根据此情况，研究了在不影响生产条件下清扫上升管的办法，为行政上所接受，在党员带头下，提前完成了工作任务，使三月份生产大大的提高了。如重机锻造场三月份的生产任务，在原来工作的情况下是完全不可能达到的，支部经过研究，想出了早生火的办法，党员带头，动员全体工友，超过了三月的生产任务。耐火厂北场支部根据镁砖质量不好，由党员想出如何检查保证质量的具体办法，提高了镁砖的质量。其它，如机修厂支部研究了生产中存在的不合理现象妨碍生产进一步提高，如老技术工脱离生产太多，组织混乱等，向行政提出了意见，改进了生产的领导，提高了产量。这样的支部已经摸索到了支部工作的方法，他们从生产的主要环节着手，又懂得如何使用党的组织力量与经过工会与青年团去推动群众，所以他们党、政、工、团的关系也配合的较好，党群关系改进了，党在群众中威信提高了。目前这样的支部还不多。
    大多数支部还是不会运用党的组织力量去解决生产工作上主要环节，还没有真正体验到如何保证监督生产，只是照例的开会，一般的检讨，不能解决多少问题。有少数支部对保证监督生产有错误认识，有的把生产工作与党的工作对立起来，认为不能都作好，如重机三分场认为行政搞好了，支部工作搞垮了。还有的支部党政不分，如基本建设处配管厂厂长兼支书，行政工作在支部会上讨论、决定、布置。还有的支部认为党的监督作用是经过党员去监视群众，支部决定的事情要群众执行，群众不执行则由党员指问。
    在保证监督生产的问题上体验到以下几点：
    １、保证与监督生产是党的支部（也是党委的）基本任务，只有从这一点着手，作好这一工作，其它工作可以容易解决了，党在生产上表现出它的力量与作用，作行政工作的干部便会紧紧的依靠支部。党的威信在群众中提高了，党才能进一步的提高与巩固。
    ２、有不少的车间支部、车间小组的支书或小组长，都是行政的分场主任或班长兼职，他们都是老技术工，在工人中又有威信，与党员与群众熟悉。所以往往这样的支部作的较好，在生产任务来了，或遇到困难时，他们首先去动员党的力量，然后去动员群众。很自然的体现出党、政、工的关系。
    ３、党的保证监督生产的作用，作得好的差不多都是工人能掌握生产过程的生产单位；技术复杂的（如炼钢厂）厂子，技术上完全由技术人员掌握，而我们在技术人员中无党员，又未作好技术人员的工作，所以那里的支部很难起保证生产的作用。
    ４、依车间划分支部，党员多的，连续生产部门按班次划为分支部，按工种编小组（如初轧厂，按甲、乙、丙三班各编成分支部，在一个分支部中按加热、压延、剪断等工种，划分小组）。同时把党的工作重心放在车间支部，是非常重要的，只有这样，才能使党的生活与工作充实与活跃，才能发挥党的作用。
    根据这次座谈会的情形，鞍山市委组织部召集了一次全鞍山钢铁公司的支部书记一百多人讲了一次支部如何保证监督生产与支部的领导方法，对新的支书有些帮助。今后预备每月召集一二次全体支书会，请作的好的支书作典型报告。
