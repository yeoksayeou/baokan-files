　　A Certain Battalion of the Chahar Military Region Returns Well-Cultivated Vegetable Plots to Farmers

    A certain battalion of the Chahar Military Region, abiding by the land reform policy, returned the vegetable plots that the battalion had already cultivated before the land reform in that area to the farmers who obtained land, in accordance with the provisions of the land reform. Last year, the battalion cultivated three mu of public land (formerly the land of the puppet municipal government) in the South Vegetable Garden of the Second District of Zhangjiakou City to solve the problem of vegetable consumption for the entire battalion. During the land reform last winter, the three mu of land were equally divided between the poor peasants Xue Qishiyi and Zhang Bubin. At that time, because Zhang had no ability to cultivate the land, the village agricultural association director and the battalion platoon leader, Comrade Yuan Xicai, negotiated three times, and Zhang Bubin's one and a half mu of land was allowed to continue to be cultivated by the battalion. This spring, after the battalion plowed and ridged the land, a platoon spent a full day's work to prepare the land, and also delivered two large carts of manure. They then planted cowpeas, radishes, and other vegetables, and were just waiting for watering and harvesting. On April 29, the director of the agricultural association of the Second District called the battalion and said that Zhang Bubin wanted to cultivate this piece of land again. The battalion's political commissar, Wang Huzhang, immediately agreed to this request, not only returning the piece of land to Zhang Bubin, but also the labor, manure, and seeds applied to the land were all given up because Zhang's family was very poor. The soldiers also agreed to do so, saying, "We are the people's army, this is nothing, consider it as cultivating for the old folks...." Zhang Bubin's family has three people and no land. He was initially afraid that he would not be able to get it back and asked someone to request it from the district government, because the army had invested a lot of cost in this piece of land. According to the neighborhood chief, two carts of manure totaled 1,600 catties, and each catty calculated at 150 yuan could buy 320 catties of naked oats (each catty calculated at 750 yuan). Thirty laborers were used, and each laborer was calculated at seven catties of rice per day, requiring 210 catties of millet. Therefore, after this unconditional return to Zhang's family, he was very moved and volunteered to return the money for the vegetable seeds to the battalion. In order to take care of his family's life, the battalion asked for money according to the market price at the time of purchase (April 20), a total of 64,000 yuan, and showed Zhang the receipt for the vegetable seeds. This matter had a very good impact on the masses, who said: "You couldn't even hope for such an army even if you burned incense."

　　察省军区某营把种好菜地归还农民
    察省军区某营遵守土地改革政策，把该营在该地土地改革前已经种好的菜地按土地改革的规定，退给了得地的农民。该营去年在张市二区南菜园种公地三亩（前敌伪市政府的地），以解决全营吃菜问题。去冬土地改革时，将该三亩地平分给了贫民薛七十一、张步宾，当时因张无力种植，经该村农会主任与该营排长苑喜才同志三次交涉，将张步宾的一亩半地仍让该营续种。今春经该营翻掘拢畦，一个排整费了一天的工，将地整好，并送大粪两大车，后即种上了豆角、罗?等菜蔬，就只等浇水收成了。四月二十九日，该二区农会主任打电话给该营说，张步宾又想种这块地了，该营王虎章政委当即同意了这个要求，不仅把那块地退还了张步宾，连施用在地里的人工、大粪和种籽，也因为张家很穷，也整个不要了，战士们也同意这么办，他们说：“我们是人民的军队，这算不了什么，就算给老乡代耕了。……”按张步宾家中有三口人，地无一垄，他起初怕要不回来，曾托人向区政府要求。因为军队在这块地里已下了很大的成本。据该闾闾长谈：两车大粪共一千六百斤，每斤按一百五十元计算，可买莜面三百二十斤（每斤按七百五十元计）。工用了三十个，每个工每日按七斤米计算，需用小米二百一十斤。所以这次无代价归还张家后，他很受感动，自愿将菜籽钱还给该营。该营为了照顾他家生活，即按当时（四月二十日）所买市价要钱，共六万四千元，并将买菜籽单据给张看了。这事情给群众影响很好，说：“真是烧香也盼不到这样的军队。”
