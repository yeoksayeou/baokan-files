In Northern Anhui, 150 Workers' Schools Established; 660,000 Farmers Participate in Winter Study
Social Education Work Conference Summarizes Workers' and Peasants' Spare-Time Education

[Our Newspaper's Report] Correspondent Liu Guang reports: In order to summarize the social education work of the past year, the Cultural and Educational Department of the Northern Anhui Administrative Office convened the region's first Social Education Work Conference from April 16th to 22nd. Attending the conference were 92 people, including those in charge of the cultural and educational departments and cultural centers of each special district, city, and county, as well as the principals and teachers of exemplary workers' spare-time schools and winter schools.

According to information gathered at the conference: Currently, 151 workers' spare-time schools have been established throughout the region, totaling 336 classes with 14,769 students, accounting for approximately 10% of the region's 150,000 workers. After enrolling in these schools, workers not only improved their cultural level but also raised their political awareness. Generally, workers have come to understand that the Communist Party is their own party, and they understand their position in the new China. Consequently, their work attitude and labor enthusiasm have greatly improved. For example, the workers' school in Wuhe cultivated 17 trade union cadres, developed 7 Party members, and 17 Communist Youth League members among its 234 students; after receiving education, workers at the Bengbu Baoxing Flour Mill broke all previous daily production records. Some workers have overcome guild mentalities in their studies, changed some past improper work styles, and workers in private factories have been able to actively unite with capitalists to promote production.

In terms of peasant spare-time education, to date, a total of 16,392 winter schools have been established throughout the region, totaling 20,712 classes, with 486,422 male students and 178,050 female students, totaling 664,472 students; if the 400,000 migrant workers winter schools on the Yangtze River and Huai River embankments are added, the total number of students is over one million. Through winter study, the cultural level of the peasants has been improved; for example, the winter school students in Huanglu Township who learned the most have been able to recognize 600 characters, and those who learned the least have been able to recognize nearly 100 characters. Winter schools in various places have also conducted policy education on reasonable burden, rent reduction, anti-despotism, bandit suppression, production for disaster relief, and land reform, directly and indirectly promoting the completion of central tasks such as production for disaster relief. Now, some winter schools in Chengnan District of Feixi County and Changshan District of Sixian County have become permanent peasant schools.

In terms of cultural center work, there are already 43 cultural centers in the region, almost one in every county seat. In addition, there is also a peasant cultural center. Cultural centers in various places have played a significant role in carrying out worker education, uniting intellectuals and educated youth.

Through the reports and discussions of the conference, cadres from various places exchanged experiences in organizing and leading social education work, and reached relatively consistent opinions on the direction, tasks, organization, leadership, staffing, funding, teachers, curriculum, teaching materials, and teaching methods of cultural centers, workers' schools, and winter schools in the future. At the same time, the shortcomings in past social education work were also reviewed: for example, some winter schools paid attention to formalities such as raising flags, drills, and classroom etiquette, but did not focus on combining learning with production for disaster relief; some teachers in workers' schools did not educate according to the needs of the students, resulting in the collapse of workers' schools; some cultural centers did not have a focus in their work, did not know their education targets, and were entangled with some petty citizens and philistines, sometimes accommodating backwardness and not raising their political awareness; in the leadership of social education work, sometimes several departments competed to lead, making the staff at a loss, and sometimes no one cared, letting it drift freely. Preliminary corrective measures were discussed at the conference for these deviations.

During the conference, Lu Xuebin, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Northern Anhui District Committee of the CPC, and Dai Yue, Director of the Cultural and Educational Department of the Northern Anhui Administrative Office, gave thematic reports and summary reports respectively. Minister Lu Xuebin first explained the direction of cultural and educational work, asking everyone to repeatedly study "On New Democracy" and the cultural and educational policies in the Common Program. He also pointed out that the high tide of cultural construction has not yet arrived, and cultural and educational workers cannot subjectively separate themselves from reality to carry out their work. Second, cultural and educational work should be carried out with a focus, especially in running schools for government employees and workers' and peasants' supplementary schools. Third, the current cultural and educational work in the Northern Anhui region should serve production for disaster relief, and all means should be devised to adhere to education in disaster areas. Fourth, in reforming old artists, old health personnel, etc., do not be impatient, but start with ideological transformation. Finally, everyone should form a communication group, write more articles, and publish them in newspapers and magazines to exchange experiences.

Director Dai Yue explained the guidelines and tasks of social education work, and then raised several specific issues, including: (1) Continuing to develop and improve workers' spare-time education work, and the schooling system and curriculum of workers' spare-time schools should gradually become standardized. (2) Requiring all localities to summarize winter school work. Preparations for this year's winter schools should be made early. At present, attention should be paid to ensuring that the existing permanent peasant literacy classes continue, and some should be appropriately developed in places with good conditions. (3) The task of cultural centers is to become the core of workers' and peasants' spare-time learning and recreational activities, based on the general policy of cultural and educational work and combined with the central tasks of each period.

　　皖北建工人学校一百五十所  六十六万农民参加冬学学习
    社教工作会议总结工农业余教育工作
    【本报讯】通讯员刘光报道：皖北行署文教处为了总结一年来的社会教育工作，于四月十六日至二十二日召开了全区第一届社会教育工作会议。到会的有各专署、市、县的文教科、文化馆负责人以及典型工人业余学校与冬学的校长、教员等九十二人。
    据会议中了解：全区现已建立工人业余学校一五一所，计三三六班，学员共一四、七六九人，约占全区十五万工人的百分之十。这些工人入学之后，不仅提高了文化水平，而且提高了政治觉悟。一般工人都懂得了共产党是自己的党，了解了自己在新中国的地位，因之工作情绪、劳动热情大大提高。如五河的工人学校，在二三四名学员中，培养了十七名工会干部，发展了党员七名，青年团员十七名；蚌埠宝兴面粉厂工人经过教育后，每日生产量打破了历来的纪录。有些工人在学习中克服了行会思想，改变了过去一些不正派的作风，私营工厂工人则能主动地团结资方，推进生产。
    在农民业余教育方面，到现在为止，全区共建立了冬学一六、三九二所，计二○、七一二班，男学员四八六、四二二人，女学员一七八、○五○人，共计六六四、四七二人；如加上江堤、淮堤的民工冬学四十万人，学员共在百万以上。通过冬学，提高了农民的文化水平，如黄麓乡冬学学员最多的已能识六百字，最少的也将近一百字。各地冬学并进行了合理负担、减租、反霸、剿匪、生产救灾以及土地改革等政策教育，直接间接推动了生产救灾等中心任务的完成。现在，肥西城南区、宿县常山区等地，一部分冬学已变成了长期的农民学校。
    在文化馆工作方面，全区已有文化馆四十三所，差不多每个县城所在地都有了一所。另外，还有一所农民文化馆。各地文化馆在开展工人教育、团结知识分子和知识青年等方面，起了很大作用。
    通过大会的汇报与讨论，各地干部交流了组织领导社教工作的经验，并对今后文化馆、工人学校、冬学的方向、任务、组织、领导、编制、经费、师资、课程、教材、教法等都得出了比较一致的意见。同时，也检讨了过去社教工作中的缺点：如有些冬学注意升旗、出操、课堂礼节等等形式，而不着重与生产救灾结合进行学习；有些工人学校的教师，不根据学员的需要进行教育，结果工人学校垮台；有些文化馆工作没有重点，不知道教育的对象，纠缠于一些小市民、市侩之间，有时迁就落后，不去提高他们的政治认识；在社教工作的领导上，有时几个部门争着去领导，使工作人员无所适从，有时又没人管，让其自流。这些偏向，都在会议中商讨了初步的纠正办法。
    大会中，中共皖北区党委宣传部陆学斌部长与皖北行署文教处戴岳处长先后作了专题报告与总结报告。陆学斌部长首先说明了文教工作的方向，要大家反复研究“新民主主义论”与共同纲领中的文教政策。并指出目前还未到文化建设高潮时期，文教工作者不能主观地脱离现实去进行工作。第二，现在应该有重点地去进行文化教育工作，特别是开办机关学校和工农补习学校。第三，皖北区目前文教工作要为生产救灾服务，应想出一切办法，坚持灾区教育。第四，在改造旧艺人、旧卫生人员等时，不要性急，要从改造思想入手。最后要大家成立通讯小组，多写稿子，在报纸、杂志发表，以交流经验。
    戴岳处长说明了社教工作的方针、任务等之后，并提出了几个具体问题，其中包括：（一）继续发展与提高工人业余教育工作，工人业余学校的学制、课程应逐步走向正规。（二）要求各地总结冬学工作。今年冬学要提早作准备。目前要注意使现有常年的农民识字班坚持下去，并选择条件好的地方，适当发展一些。（三）文化馆的任务是根据文教工作总方针，结合各个时期的中心任务，做到成为工农业余学习和文娱活动的核心。
