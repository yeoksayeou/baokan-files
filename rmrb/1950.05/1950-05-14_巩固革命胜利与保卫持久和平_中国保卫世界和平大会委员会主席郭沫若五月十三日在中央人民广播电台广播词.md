　　(I)
　　Our Chinese people's revolution has been victorious. The People's Republic of China has been consolidated, and the people have become the masters. All of China's territory, except for Tibet, Taiwan, and a few other scattered small islands, has been liberated. Even the continued liberation of Tibet and Taiwan is only a matter of time.
　　Our victory is unprecedented and has global significance. People all over the world who love peace and democracy have been rejoicing as if it were their own victory.
　　Why does our victory have global significance? It is because our victory is an important factor in defending world peace. The mortal enemy of world peace—imperialism—is an aggressive institution in itself. The lifeline of imperialism lies in possessing vast colonies and semi-colonies. Today, our great China has been liberated from the shackles of semi-colonialism and has driven out the aggressive forces of imperialism. This has shortened the life of imperialism, weakened its power, and thus strengthened the forces of the world peace camp. It is no accident that peace-loving and democratic people around the world are sincerely expressing their congratulations.
　　Our victory did not come easily. Since the Opium War, we have continuously engaged in bloody struggles with foreign aggressors and their running dogs within China. We don't know how much blood of the Chinese people has been shed to achieve today's victory! Such a precious victory, can we not be willing to use the greatest strength to expand it and consolidate it? Of course, we must do so!
　　Then how should we expand our victory? Needless to say, we must first expand our military victory. We must continue to use the greatest strength to support the People's Liberation Army, quickly liberate Taiwan, liberate Tibet, liberate the other scattered small islands, so that our Chinese territory can be quickly and fully liberated.
　　At the same time, we must gradually expand our revolutionary military victory into economic victory, political victory, and cultural victory, transforming our backward agricultural China into an industrialized China. Only in this way can our victory be consolidated, and our national defense be consolidated.
　　Therefore, following the revolutionary military victory, we must devote the greatest effort to production and construction, quickly restore war wounds, reform all semi-feudal and semi-colonial modes of production, and develop them into new democratic modes of production and even higher stages of production.
　　Such large-scale production and construction needs lasting peace to be guaranteed. The reason why China has been backward for a hundred years is because we lost the guarantee of peaceful construction. Our peaceful life was deprived of us by the imperialists and their running dogs. Although our victory today has basically won back our peace, our peace has not yet been fully realized, nor has it been free from threats. Today, we should expand our victory to expand our peace, and consolidate our victory to consolidate our peace. This is the sacred task that every Chinese person should undertake.
　　(II)
　　The aggressive nature of imperialism is becoming increasingly blatant today. The main reason for this is that the development of imperialism itself has reached its end, while the strength of the peace and democracy camp opposing imperialism is growing stronger day by day. This has forced the imperialists to feel the dual pressure from within and without, and they have pushed themselves to the point of near madness in order to save their demise.
　　The world has experienced two world wars in less than thirty years. After the First World War, the Soviet Union's October Revolution eliminated a Russian imperialism and a socialist state, the Soviet Union, emerged. After the Second World War, the three imperialisms of Germany, Japan, and Italy were overthrown, and ten new democratic countries emerged in Eastern Europe and East Asia.
　　The remaining imperialist powers, Britain and France, have been weakened and have in fact become vassals of American imperialism. Although American imperialism did not suffer direct war damage in the two world wars and made a fortune in the war, what is its situation today? Due to the inability to resolve internal contradictions, production is declining day by day, and the working people are losing their jobs day by day. Last October (1949), the industrial level of the United States decreased by 22 percent compared to October of the previous year. According to official US statistics, at the end of last year, there were 10 million partially unemployed and 4.5 million fully unemployed. In addition, there are about 3.5 million people who "have jobs but have not started work." Therefore, the total number of truly unemployed workers is 18 million. This is the current situation of the most arrogant American imperialism. Other vassal imperialist countries in Western Europe, which have been forced to the brink of bankruptcy, need not be discussed in detail.
　　Compared with the increasingly declining and increasingly internally contradictory situation of the imperialist camp, the increasingly consolidated and prosperous world peace and democracy camp is becoming even more brilliant.
　　First of all, the leader of the peace and democracy camp—the Soviet Union—is experiencing rapid development in production, and the working people not only have no unemployment, but their lives are becoming more prosperous and happier. Taking industry as an example, the Soviet Union's total production last year exceeded 41 percent of that in 1940 before the war. Taking agriculture as an example, 1949 also exceeded the pre-war level and reached the figure for 1950 stipulated in the post-war five-year plan. As a result, the Soviet Union's national income in 1949 increased by 36 percent compared to 1940 before the war. The living standards of workers and peasants have generally improved. Calculated according to the price index, the total income of workers increased by 24 percent compared to 1940, and the income of peasants increased by 30 percent.
　　Just comparing the Soviet Union with the United States in this way, it can be seen that one side is clearly becoming more prosperous, while the other side is clearly becoming more decadent.
　　In addition, the general prosperity of the new democratic countries, especially the great victory of the people's revolution won by our Chinese people, has made the imperialist camp feel even more bleak and panicked, and they cannot help but tremble before this vast force for peace.
　　(III)
　　Any existence, when it comes to decline, always accelerates its own demise. Everything that imperialism, especially American imperialism, expresses today is exactly like this. The more it feels bleak, the more it panics; the more it feels panic, the more it struggles. Today, the imperialists' frantic clamoring for war and expansion of armaments are in fact the most concrete manifestations of their panic and struggle.
　　Look at the huge military spending figures of the imperialists!
　　First of all, American imperialism, in the total amount of US$41.9 billion in the 1949-1950 national budget, direct military spending accounted for US$14.3 billion, an increase of 14 times compared to the military spending in 1938-39 before World War II. In addition, the total military spending, including the cost of manufacturing atomic weapons and military subsidies, reached US$28.4 billion, accounting for 68 percent of the total budget. The next year's budget, which is currently being discussed in the US Congress and will take effect from July 1 this year, will expand military spending further, accounting for 76 percent of the total budget. Three-quarters of the next year's US budget will be used for war preparations.
　　Although Britain, France, and even Italy have been reduced to vassals, begging for scraps from American imperialism to survive, their military budgets have also frantically embarked on the road of expansion. Britain's budget for 1949-50 was £760 million - an increase of £177.5 million over the previous year. France's was 80 trillion francs, and Italy's was 301.3 billion lire, both accounting for one-third of the national budget.
　　What do these phenomena tell us? This clearly tells us the panic and struggle of the imperialists, and it also clearly tells us that the crisis of a new war does exist and is growing, and that peace is under significant threat.
　　A cornered dog may jump over a wall. We cannot ignore the madness of the imperialists because they have been weakened, nor can we reduce our vigilance because the democratic camp has been strengthened. Today, anyone who ignores the crisis of a new war will make a major mistake. Especially in our China, anyone who is intoxicated with the victory of the revolution and embraces the concept of peace will make an even greater mistake.
　　Listen to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's call for the celebration of May Day!
　　"Workers of all countries, unite! Fight for lasting peace and people's democracy! Oppose the instigators of a new war!
　　"People of Asia, unite! Oppose imperialist aggression! Strive for national independence and democratic freedom! Oppose the imperialist Pacific Alliance plan!"
　　Listen again to the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party's call for the celebration of May Day!
　　"Working people of all countries, expose the evil plans of the war merchants! Expand and consolidate the powerful front for peace! Defending peace is the cause of all people in the world!"
　　We should thoroughly support these loud, powerful, timely, and urgent calls, and quickly and continuously express our response through propaganda and action.
　　Our Chinese people have spent a hundred years of bloody struggle to achieve liberation, national independence, democratic freedom, and peaceful construction. Although we have achieved basic peace today, the obstruction, sabotage, threats, and hostility of imperialism, especially American imperialism, towards us are becoming more and more unscrupulous.
　　American imperialism is still supporting the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang in their pirate-like struggles, blatantly supporting the remaining forces of Japanese imperialism, and blatantly colluding with a small group of Asian national scum to organize the so-called "Pacific Alliance" to carry out a blockade against us and suppress the liberation movement of the Asian people. We absolutely cannot sit idly by. All the people of Asia cannot sit idly by either.
　　(IV)
　　Indeed, "Defending peace is the cause of all people in the world!"
　　Today, the imperialists' threat of a new war is not limited to Asia, but extends to the whole world. Peace is indivisible. We should mobilize the strength of the people of the world to eliminate this evil war plan, maintain human security, and strengthen the defense of lasting peace.
　　What is exciting for us is that the peace defense of peace-loving people around the world is increasingly united and expressed through concrete actions that cannot be underestimated.
　　The World Peace Congress, established in Paris and Prague last April by representatives from seventy-two countries, is becoming increasingly consolidated and developed. In just one year, branches have been established in fifty-two countries, and the Congress has ten million members, accounting for half of the world's population.
　　From March 15 to 19 this year, the Standing Committee of the Congress held its third meeting in Stockholm, bringing the international movement for the defense of peace to an important new stage. The Standing Committee of the Congress issued the following appeal to peace-loving people around the world:
　　"We demand an unconditional ban on the use of atomic weapons as weapons of aggression and mass destruction of people, and we demand the establishment of strict international control to ensure the implementation of this decision.
　　"We will consider any government that first uses atomic weapons against any country as a war criminal.
　　"We call on all good people in the world to sign this appeal."
　　The signature campaign has been launched universally around the world, and it is also being launched universally in our China. This should not be ignored, and it is a powerful answer to the clamoring of war merchants.
　　—Do you want war? We want peace!
　　—Do you want to drop atomic bombs? You are war criminals!
　　This clear appeal is a warning to the war merchants and a mobilization for those who defend peace. The war merchants will naturally not stop their war conspiracy because of our appeal, and we peace defenders should not consider that we have done everything possible to defend peace with just one appeal. No, we cannot be so careless. We must be constantly vigilant, constantly mobilize, unite and organize our own strength on the one hand, and disintegrate and strip the strength of the opposing forces on the other. We must make the opposing forces fear us and dare not act. If the opposing forces dare to act rashly, we must have sufficient strength and sufficient preparation to punish these war criminals.
　　(V)
　　We must repeat this: our appeal is not to petition the war merchants for peace, but to force the imperialists to stop their aggression.
　　Peace is precious. But peace is not a temporary respite. Our Chinese people should know this particularly clearly. We have had more than a hundred years of bloody experience in order to achieve today's basic peace.
　　Therefore, today, defending lasting world peace is inseparable from consolidating our revolutionary victory. We must support all the calls of the Peace Congress, support the instructions in the May Day calls of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and under the leadership of the peace fortress, the Soviet Union, unite with the peace-loving people of the world to jointly oppose imperialist aggression. This will inevitably consolidate our revolutionary victory. Conversely, if our revolutionary victory is expanded and consolidated, it will inevitably make a great contribution to the defense of world peace.
　　Today, we want victory, and we also want peace; we want peace, and we also want victory. We want the peace of victory, and we want the victory of peace.
　　In order to achieve this goal, we must generously endure the burden of victory. This burden is glorious and rewarding. Peace is never a compassionate gift from the aggressors, peace is precisely the glorious reward for those who bear the burden of victory!
　　Let the war merchants of imperialism tremble before our powerful peace camp!
　　A cornered dog wants to jump over a wall, it will end its dog life!

　　巩固革命胜利与保卫持久和平
　　中国保卫世界和平大会委员会主席郭沫若五月十三日在中央人民广播电台广播词
            （一）
    我们中国人民革命是胜利了。中华人民共和国已经巩固，人民作了主人。全中国的国土，除掉西藏、台湾和其他三两个零星的小岛子之外，已经全部解放，就是西藏和台湾等地的继续解放也只是时间迟早的问题了。
    我们的胜利是空前的，是有世界意义的，全世界爱好和平民主的人民一直都在当着自己的胜利一样欢欣鼓舞。
    为什么我们的胜利是有世界意义的呢？这是因为我们的胜利是保卫世界和平的一个重要的因素。世界和平的死对头——帝国主义，它本身就是一个侵略机构。帝国主义的生命线是在拥有广大的殖民地和半殖民地。今天我们伟大的中国从半殖民地的枷锁下解放了出来，把帝国主义的侵略势力驱逐了。这就缩短了帝国主义的生命，削灭了帝国主义的势力，因而也就增强了世界和平阵营的力量。全世界爱好和平民主的人民之所以倾诚地表示庆贺，决不是偶然的事。
    我们的胜利，得来是不容易的。自从鸦片战争以来，我们连续不断地和外来的侵略者和它在中国内部的走狗们作着流血的斗争，为了争取到今天的胜利真不知道流了我们中国人民多少的鲜血！这样可宝贵的胜利，我们难道还不肯用最大的力量来扩大它并巩固它吗？当然是要这样做的！
    那么我们该怎样来扩大我们的胜利？不用说我们首先就要扩大我们的军事的胜利，我们要继续用最大的力量来支持人民解放军，迅速解放台湾，解放西藏，解放其他的几个零星小岛，使我们中国的国土迅速地得到全面的解放。
    同时我们还得把我们革命的军事胜利，逐步地扩大而为经济的胜利，政治的胜利，文化的胜利，使我们落后的农业中国成为工业化的中国。要这样，我们的胜利也才能够巩固，我们的国防也才能够巩固。
    因此，我们随着革命的军事胜利，必须用最大的力量从事生产建设，要迅速地把战争创伤恢复起来，改革一切半封建半殖民地性的生产方式，而使他发展成为新民主主义的生产方式乃至更高阶段的生产方式。
    这样大规模的生产建设是需要有持久的和平才能得到保障的。一百年来我们中国之所以落后，就是因为我们失掉了和平建设的保障。我们的和平生活是被帝国主义者和它的走狗们给我们剥夺了。我们今天的胜利虽然在基本上已经把我们的和平争取了回来，但我们的和平还没有全面化，也还没有解除它的威胁。我们今天正应该以扩大我们的胜利来扩大我们的和平，以巩固我们的胜利来巩固我们的和平，这是我们每一个中国人民所应该担负的神圣的任务。
            （二）
    帝国主义的侵略本质在今天是愈来愈露骨了。这主要的原因是帝国主义本身的发展已经走向了末路，而反对帝国主义的和平民主阵营的力量却又一天一天地壮大了起来。这样就使得帝国主义者不得不感受着内外双重的压力，他们为了挽救自己的末路，把自己逼到了快要疯狂的地步了。
    世界在不足三十年的期间经历了两次大战。在第一次大战之后，由于苏联的十月革命消灭了一个俄罗斯帝国主义而出现了一个社会主义的国家苏联。在第二次大战之后，又推翻了德意志、日本、意大利三个帝国主义，而在东欧和东亚出现了十个新民主主义的国家。
    残余的帝国主义，英国和法国是被削弱了，事实上成为了美国帝国主义的附庸。美国帝国主义尽管在两次大战中没有受到直接的战争祸害，反而在战争中发了横财，但它今天的情形是怎样呢？由于内在的矛盾无法解决，生产一天一天的下降，劳动人民一天一天的失业。去年（一九四九）十月美国的工业水平比起前年十月降低了百分之二十二。失业工人，据美国的官方统计，在去年年底，半失业者有一千万，全失业者四百五十万。此外还有什么“有了工作还没有上工”的有三百五十万左右。因此真正的失业工人合共是一千八百万人。这是目前最飞扬跋扈的美帝国主义的情形，其他像西欧的附庸性的帝国主义国家已经迫到了破产的边沿的可以不必细说了。
    和这帝国主义阵营的日趋没落与日益增加内部矛盾的情形相比，而世界和平民主阵营的日趋巩固与繁荣，便愈显得光辉灿烂。
    首先是和平民主阵营的领导者——苏联，生产是在突飞猛进的发展，劳动人民不仅没有失业的现象，而且生活愈见富裕，愈见幸福了。拿工业来说，苏联去年的总生产量已经超过了战前一九四○年的百分之四十一。拿农业来说，一九四九年也超过了战前的水平，而达到了战后五年计划所规定的一九五○年的数字。因而一九四九年苏联的国家收入比大战前夕一九四○年增加了百分之三十六。工人农民的生活水平普遍地提高了，照物价指数计算，工人的总收入比一九四○年增加了百分之二十四，农民增加了百分之三十。
    就这样单拿苏联与美国对比，便可以看出，一边是明显地日趋繁荣，一边是明显地日趋没落。
    更加上新民主主义国家的普遍繁荣，特别是我们中国人民所获得的伟大的人民革命的胜利，这就使得帝国主义的阵营愈见感觉着萧条、恐慌，而不能不在这浩大的和平力量之前发抖了。
            （三）
    任何存在，凡是临到没落的时候，总是愈见加速度地来促进自己的没落的。帝国主义，尤其美国帝国主义今天所表示的一切行动也正是这样。愈见感觉着萧条便愈见恐慌，愈见感觉着恐慌便愈见挣扎。在今天帝国主义者们的疯狂地叫嚣战争，扩大军备，事实上正是它们的恐慌和挣扎的最具体的表现。
    请看帝国主义者们的庞大的军费数字吧！
    首先是美国帝国主义，在一九四九——一九五○年的国家预算四一、九○○万万美元的总额中，直接军费占一四、三○○万万美元，比二次大战前一九三八——三九年的军费增加了十四倍。再加上原子武器制造费和军人辅助费等全部军费达到二八、四○○万万美元，占全预算的百分之六十八。目前在美国国会里讨论着的从本年七月一日起的下年度预算，军费还要扩大，要占全预算的百分之七十六。下年度的美国预算会有四分之三是用来从事战争准备了。
    英国法国甚至意大利尽管它们降为了附庸，讨求着美国帝国主义的残羹剩饭在过活，而它们的军事预算也同样疯狂地走上了膨胀的道路。英国在一九四九——五○年度为七亿六千万镑——比上一个年度增加了一亿七百五十万镑。法国是八十万亿法郎，意大利是三十万一千三百亿利拉，都占全国预算三分之一。
    这些现象告诉了我们什么呢？这明显地告诉了我们帝国主义者的恐慌与挣扎，而同样明显地也告诉了我们：新战争的危机的确是存在而且增长着，和平是受着了显著的威胁的。
    狗急可以跳墙。我们不能因为帝国主义已经削弱了而忽视它们的疯狂，也不能因为民主阵营已经加强了而减低自己的警惕。在今天，谁要是忽视了新战争的危机，谁便会犯下重大的错误。尤其在我们中国，谁要是陶醉于革命的胜利而怀抱着太平观念，那所犯的错误，会是更加重大的。
    请听中共中央庆祝五一劳动节的号召吧！
    “全世界工人阶级联合起来，为持久和平与人民民主而斗争！反对新战争的挑拨者！
    “亚洲人民联合起来，反对帝国主义侵略！争取民族独立和民主自由！反对帝国主义的太平洋联盟计划！”
    再请听联共中央庆祝五一劳动节的号召吧！
    “一切国家的劳动人民，揭露战争贩子们的罪恶计划！扩大并巩固强大的拥护和平阵线！保卫和平是全世界一切人民的事业！”
    这些宏亮的有力的适时的紧迫的号召，我们应该彻底地拥护，并迅速地不断地用宣传和行动来表示我们的响应。
    我们中国人民为了争取解放，争取民族独立，争取民主自由，争取和平建设，已经费了一百年的流血斗争，今天虽然争取到了基本上的和平，而帝国主义尤其美国帝国主义对于我们的阻挠、破坏、威胁、敌对，却是愈来愈肆无忌惮了。
    美国帝国主义一直到今天都还在支持着蒋介石残余匪帮作海盗式的挣扎，明目张胆地扶植日本帝国主义的残余势力，明目张胆地纠结一小群亚洲民族的败类组织所谓“太平洋联盟”来进行对于我们的封锁，来镇压亚洲人民的解放运动，我们是绝对不能够坐视的。全亚洲人民也是不能坐视的。
            （四）
    的确，“保卫和平是全世界一切人民的事业”！
    今天帝国主义者的新战争威胁不仅限于亚洲，并且普及于全世界。和平是不可分割的，我们正应该发动全世界人民的力量来消灭这一罪恶的战争计划，来保持人类的安全，加强持久和平的保卫。
    值得我们兴奋的，是全世界爱好和平的人民对于和平的保卫正日益团结而以具体的行动来表示了不可轻侮的力量了。
    去年四月在巴黎和布拉格由七十二个国家的代表们所成立的世界拥护和平大会正日见巩固和发展，仅仅一年期间已经有五十二个国家成立了分会，而大会的会员已经有十万万人，占全世界人口的一半了。
    今年三月十五日至十九日，大会常设委员会在斯德哥尔摩举行了第三次会议，使保卫和平的国际性运动又进入了一个重要的新阶段。大会常委会向全世界爱好和平的人民提出了这样的一项呼吁书：
    “我们要求无条件地禁止把原子武器当作侵略与大规模毁灭人民的武器，并要求建立严格的国际管制，以确保这一决定的执行。
    “任何第一个使用原子武器来对付任何国家的政府，我们均将认之为战争罪犯。
    “我们号召全世界一切善良的人们在这一呼吁书上签名”。
    签名运动已经在全世界普遍地展开了，在我们全中国也正在普遍的展开，不可忽视，这对于战争贩子们的叫嚣正是一个有力的回答。
    ——你们要战争吗？我们要和平！
    ——你们要投原子弹吗？你们就是战争罪犯！
    这一明朗的呼吁对于战争贩子们是警告，对于保卫和平者是动员。战争贩子们自然不会因我们的一纸呼吁而停止他们的战争阴谋，而在我们和平保卫者也不应该仅仅以一纸的呼吁便算尽了保卫和平的能事。不，我们不能这样马虎，我们要经常警惕，不断动员，一方面团结，组织自己的力量，另一方面，瓦解，削剥敌对者的力量。我们要使敌对者有所畏而不敢为。如果敌对者敢于轻举妄动，我们要有充分的力量、充分的准备来惩治这些战争罪犯。
            （五）
    我们要重复地这样说：我们的呼吁并不是向战争贩子们请愿和平，而是要迫使帝国主义者停止侵略。
    和平是可宝贵的。但和平不是苟且的偷安。我们中国人民应该知道得特别清楚，我们为了争取到今天的基本上的和平，已经有了一百多年的流血的经验了。
    因此在今天，保卫世界的持久的和平和巩固我们的革命胜利是分不开来的。我们一定要拥护和平大会的一切号召，拥护联共中央和中共中央在五一号召中的指示，并在和平堡垒苏联的领导之下，联合全世界爱好和平的人民共同反对帝国主义的侵略。这样也就必然地会巩固我们的革命胜利。反过来，我们的革命胜利如果愈见扩大，愈见巩固，也就必然地对于世界和平的保卫会有莫大的贡献。
    在今天，我们要胜利，也要和平；要和平，也要胜利。我们要胜利的和平，要和平的胜利。
    为了达到这个目的，我们就必须慷慨的忍受胜利的负担。这负担是光荣的，是有报酬的。和平决不是太上侵略者的慈悲的恩赐，和平正是胜利负担者的光荣的报酬！
    让帝国主义的战争贩子们在我们强大的和平阵营面前发抖吧！
    狗急要跳墙，就断送它的狗命！
