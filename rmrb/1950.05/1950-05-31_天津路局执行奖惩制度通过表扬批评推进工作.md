Tianjin Railway Bureau Implements Reward and Punishment System to Promote Work Through Commendation and Criticism
[Our dispatch] Correspondent Liu Lin reports: The Tianjin Railway Administration strictly implements the reward and punishment system, powerfully promoting various tasks through commendation and criticism. After the takeover and inventory work concluded last March, the bureau implemented its first widespread rewards for employees who contributed to the takeover. At that time, forty-three units received collective rewards, fifty-eight individuals were recognized for major contributions, three hundred and forty individuals received minor awards, and seven individuals received pay raises and promotions. A total of 570,000 yuan in bonuses were issued (equivalent to over 33,300 jin of millet at the time), and 1,872 people were rewarded. Since then, the bureau has used reward work as one of the driving forces to promote work. From November of last year to January of this year, it successively convened system-wide summary and merit evaluation meetings for machinery, engineering, electrical, materials, finance, and vehicle departments. Extensive rewards were given to models of innovation, work improvement, record creation, and participation in voluntary labor. In total, over 5,000 people received rewards throughout the year, accounting for over 11% of the total number of employees, while 994 people were disciplined. Among them, 93 were expelled for serious corruption, dereliction of duty, and violations of laws and regulations, and 77 were demoted, downgraded, or had their salaries reduced. On January 21st of this year, a system-wide celebration conference was held, bringing together 227 heroes and models from various departments, regions, and units for a general evaluation of merit. Scenes of jubilation and celebration also erupted in Beijing, Fengtai, Tangshan, Dezhou, Zhangjiakou and other regions. The reward and punishment work over the past year has played a significant role in promoting the overall work. Since the handover conference, the Qinhuangdao maintenance model area has emerged. Comrade Wang Jicheng, the maintenance organizer, and the station's employees were rewarded by the Ministry of Railways and the Railway Bureau. Representatives who visited Qinhuangdao brought back the station's maintenance practices to their respective sites, and then launched an amateur maintenance movement across the line. According to statistics from 118 stations, 29,795 people, including engineers, cadres, male and female employees, and workers, participated, accounting for approximately 65.6% of the total number of employees in the entire bureau. If we include employees' families, students from Hua Da and Jun Da universities, and local cadres and the masses, the total number of participants in maintenance reached over 35,900, playing a promoting role in the national maintenance work. It has also cultivated model work areas such as Dingxing, Luofa, Xibaozi, and Guye track crews, as well as model maintenance workers such as Wang Shengsan, Wang Fu, Li Changchun, and Shao Zhizhen, laying a solid foundation for the implementation of the new maintenance responsibility system. After the locomotive and electrical affairs conferences of the railway, the Li Yonglu movement (Fengtai driver who exceeded two Class A inspections) was launched, and many typical locomotives with extended safe running during Class A inspections emerged. The Ministry of Railways has issued an order to promote Kong Fanqing's invention of the movable hammer throughout the country. Sun Baolai, the inventor of the passenger car storage battery, has gone to the Northeast to become a professor, and Liu Yulin, who solved the problem of large axle overheating, received a medal from the Ministry in the auditorium of the Ministry of Railways. After Ma Qing returned to Fengtai, he led three shunting groups and has completed 10,000 accident-free couplings.

Based on the reward and punishment work experience of the past year, the Railway Bureau has successively formulated ten single-item reward methods, such as saving locomotive coal, safe operation, train punctuality, and cultivating locomotives running 500 kilometers per day, as well as provisional measures for employee rewards and punishments. In order to implement the policy of "considering both public and private interests" and improving production, the bureau stipulates that future reward work should correct the shortcomings of being biased towards honorary rewards, neglecting material rewards, and insufficient universality of rewards. Since the conscientious implementation of the new reward methods, the production and creative enthusiasm of all employees has been generally improved. Seven red flag locomotives with a daily mileage of 500 kilometers and train crews with 500,000 kilometers of safe operation have emerged. Six excellent contracted crew groups and one female crew group have emerged. Many models of production and savings have been discovered. From March 8th to May 8th, a total of 100 rationalization proposals have been received, and collective awards have been given to 12 units and 160 individuals for their successful review and trial implementation, with a total bonus of 9.67 million yuan. In order to continue to overcome the shortcomings of insufficient contact with the frontline and insufficient introduction and promotion of typical examples, the railway is now organizing forces to go deep into the frontline and closely contact with practical workers. Many engineers personally go to various places to cooperate with workers and help with research, and it has been decided to formulate production standards for the work of various major departments and implement a bonus system for exceeding quotas to ensure the victorious completion of the production competition and create new records.

　　天津路局执行奖惩制度通过表扬批评推进工作
    【本报讯】通讯员柳林报道：天津铁路管理局严格执行奖惩制度，通过表扬和批评，有力地推动了各种工作。去年三月接管清点工作结束，路局对接管有功的职工，实行了首次广泛的奖励。当时获集体奖励的有四三个单位，立大功的五十八人，立小功的三四○人，加薪升职者七人。共发出奖金五十七万元（按当时物价折合小米三万三千三百余斤），一八七二人获得奖励。此后，路局即以奖励工作，作为推动工作的动力之一。从去年十一月到今年一月，又连续召开了全路性的机、工、电、材、财、车等部门的总结评功会议。对创造发明、改进工作、创造新纪录及参加义务劳动的模范，给予广泛的奖励。总计去年一年中，获得奖励者共五千余人，约占全路总人数百分之十一强，受到处分的九百九十四人。其中因严重贪污、渎职、违犯法纪而开除的九十三人，撤职、降职、减薪的七十七人。今年一月二十一号又召开了全路庆功大会、集中各部门各地区各单位英雄模范二百二十七名、做总的评功。北京、丰台、唐山、德县、张家口等地区，也掀起火炽欢腾的庆功场面。一年以来的奖惩工作，对推动整个工作起了很大作用。自接交大会后，秦皇岛涌现出养路模范区，养路组织者王继成同志及该站职工，受到铁道部及路局奖励，赴秦皇岛参观的代表们，把该站的养路情形带回各现场，随即掀起了全线各站业余养路运动。根据一一八个站统计，工程师、干部、男女职员、工人等有二万九千七百九十五人参加，约占全路总人数的百分之六十五·六；若连员工家属及华大、军大等校学员，地方干部群众计算在内，参加养路者共三万五千九百余人，对全国养路工作起了推动作用。并培养出定兴、落垡、西拨子、古冶道班等模范工区，与王省三、王富、李长春、邵之珍等模范养路工作者，奠定实行新养路负责制的巩固基础。该路机务、电务会议后，李永禄运动（超过两个甲检的丰台司机长）开展起来，出现许多延长甲检安全走行的典型机车。铁道部已明令将孔繁清发明的活动重锤推广全国，发明客车蓄电池的孙宝来已赴东北去当教授，解决大轴不发烧问题的刘玉林，在铁道部大礼堂得到部发奖章。马清回丰台后，带动了三个调车组，已完成万钩无事故。
    根据去年一年来的奖惩工作经验，该路局先后制定了机煤节约、安全运转、列车正点、培养日车五百公里机车等十种单行奖励办法，及职工奖惩暂行办法。为贯彻“公私兼顾”、提高生产的方针，路局规定：今后奖励工作应纠正偏于名誉奖励、忽视物质奖励及奖励不够普遍性等缺点。自从认真执行新的奖励办法后，全路职工生产与创造热情普遍提高，出现了日车五百公里的红旗机车七台，及安全走行五十万公里的乘务组。涌现了六个优良包乘组，一个女乘务组。发现了许多生产节约的模范，从三月八日到五月八日，计收到一百件合理化建议，并对审核试行有成绩者，发出集体奖十二个，个人奖一六○名，奖金九百六十七万元。该路为继续克服与现场联系不够，对典型的介绍推广不够等缺点，现已组织力量、深入现场，与实际工作者密切联系。不少工程师亲到各地与工人配合，帮助研究，并决定制定各主要部门工作的生产标准，实行超额奖励制度，以保证胜利完成生产大竞赛、创造新纪录运动的目的。
