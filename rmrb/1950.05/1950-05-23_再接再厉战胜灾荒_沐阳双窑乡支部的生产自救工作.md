　　Continuing Efforts to Overcome Disasters
　　The Production Self-Salvation Work of the Shuangyao Township Branch in Muyang
　　Shuangyao Township is a severely affected township in Muyang County, Huaiyin Prefecture, northern Jiangsu. Due to its low-lying terrain, it has been flooded eight times in five years, with last year's flood being the most severe, resulting in no autumn harvest and only 30% of the spring wheat harvest. In addition, past looting and destruction by the Chiang bandits led to 980 out of 1,054 households in the township lacking food by December of last year, accounting for over 90% of the total households. However, under the leadership of the township branch of the Chinese Communist Party, the masses were mobilized for production self-salvation, mitigating the disaster's impact and carrying out spring plowing and sowing based on the initial victory over the famine.
　　Rectifying Ideology within the Party, Reversing Negative Sentiments.
　　In November of last year, when the disaster in the township was at its worst, both Party members and the masses generally developed negative sentiments and relied on government relief. Chen Shusan, a member of the Chinese Communist Party Branch Committee, felt a headache at the mention of disaster relief. Party member Tao Dinghua said, "Such a big disaster, how can it be saved? If you have a solution, I don't." Chen Lun, the village head of Nanban Village, asked to resign when he saw disaster victims approaching him. In this serious situation, Chen Jiale, the secretary of the township branch of the Chinese Communist Party, immediately convened a branch meeting, first conducting Party education for Party members, proposing, "Communist Party members should find ways to lead the masses to overcome difficulties and defeat disasters." At the same time, he encouraged everyone to recall past experiences in overcoming famines, establishing Party members' confidence in self-salvation. The final discussion concluded that to do a good job in production and disaster relief, Party members must first establish confidence and play a leading and guaranteeing role in their work, uniting and promoting various forces to organize sideline production, coupled with government relief, there is a way to overcome the famine. The meeting also decided that each Party member should help one to three disaster-stricken households solve their difficulties and help formulate production and disaster relief plans.
　　Organizing Forces, Overcoming Difficulties, Developing Sideline Production, and Reducing the Impact of the Disaster.
　　After the branch meeting, youth league member meetings, representatives meetings from all walks of life, and mass meetings were held in each village, repeatedly explaining that as long as everyone actively engages in production, there is a way to provide disaster relief. At the meetings, models of production self-salvation were commended, and individual loafers were criticized and educated. At the representatives meetings from all walks of life, based on local habits of sideline production, the method of organizing sweet potato noodle production was emphasized. A plan to organize fifty sets of equipment was drawn up, with the government helping with thirty-five sets, and the rest mobilized through mass mutual aid. After the meetings, under the leadership of cadres, Party members, and youth league members throughout the township, the difficulties of capital and labor for sweet potato noodle production were promptly resolved for the disaster victims, and all fifty sets of noodle production equipment were quickly put into operation. At this time, the branch also decided to have experienced Party members Wang Changchun and Li Yongbo frequently inspect the various noodle-making groups to help improve technology and increase output. For example, the Chen Shuxiang noodle-making group in Qidou Village lost two dou of peas the first time due to poor technology. After Wang Changchun's help, the second time they made a profit, not only making up for the previous loss but also earning an additional one dou and six sheng. When the masses in the noodle-making group saw Wang Changchun, they happily said, "With Lao Wang, we have a solution." Party members also played a leading role in promoting other sideline industries. Yan Shanpei, a Party member in Qidou Village, organized more than 30 people to catch fish, exchanging it for four shi and two dou of grain, with each person receiving more than one dou. Chang Baofan, a Party member in Guwa Village, formulated a production self-salvation plan for his family. He and his wife participated in sweet potato noodle production, his daughter spun yarn in the morning and picked grass in the afternoon. Under his influence, more than 40 disaster-stricken households in the village also formulated plans, and the children went out to pick grass every day, collecting more than 40,000 jin in half a month, which promoted grass picking among disaster-stricken children throughout the township. Female Party member Zhong Yulan also organized seven women to catch 510 jin of fish, exchanging it for 420 jin of sorghum, and organized sixteen households to produce sweet potato noodles.
　　After sixty days of effort, by early February of this year, more than a thousand people had participated in sideline production. No household in the township was without food, and the faces of the disaster victims, who had turned pale from hunger in the past, had all recovered due to the consumption of sweet potato noodle residue.
　　Continuing Efforts to Overcome the Difficulties of Rain and Snow and Carry Out Spring Planting.
　　Around the Spring Festival, continuous rain and snow made it impossible to dry sweet potato noodles, so 34 sets of noodle-making equipment were suspended. Sideline industries such as fishing were also forced to stop. The disaster situation in the township then developed again, with 78 households running out of food. Chen Jiale, the secretary of the township branch, discussed the matter with the township head and decided to immediately convene a meeting of cadres and Party members above the village level to discuss emergency rescue measures. He called on good cadres and good Party members to withstand the severe test of rain and snow. At the meeting, 26 cadres and Party members who had made significant achievements in production and disaster relief in the past two months were commended. They then went to various villages to investigate the disaster and provide emergency assistance, mobilizing social mutual assistance. Under the leadership of cadres and Party members, a total of 1,720 jin of grain was lent out throughout the township. At the same time, the government allocated 700 jin of emergency relief grain and distributed 600 jin of wages for the first phase of dredging the Yi River, providing food and continuing various sideline production activities. As a result, the disaster situation was reduced again, and the households without food were quickly eliminated.
　　In March, when spring planting began, the branch used the original sweet potato noodle-making groups as a foundation to lead the masses in organizing 170 mutual aid groups for spring planting. This solved the difficulty of labor shortage and also helped solve the problem of food for some disaster victims during spring planting. For example, the Zhang Xiangsheng group in Nanban Village, in addition to participating in spring planting, also left four people at home to produce sweet potato noodles, ensuring that every family could still eat noodle residue during spring planting and maintain their physical strength. For families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and households without labor, cultivation was organized on their behalf; for families of workers dredging the river, labor exchange and mutual assistance were organized. By early April, most of the 12,000 mu of spring fields in the township had been sown.
　　Re-mobilizing to Overcome the April Rainstorm.
　　In mid-April, continuous rainstorms flooded most of the 12,000 mu of spring fields in the township, and various sideline production activities were also forced to stop, leading to a new development in the disaster situation. New negative sentiments arose among cadres and the masses. At this time, under the leadership of the higher-level Party committee, the township branch immediately led Party members and the masses to rescue and drain water. After seven or eight days of effort, most of the spring fields were saved. However, the wheat fields were flooded, and most of them suffered reduced yields. In response to this situation, the branch proposed: "Disaster relief should be planned for the long term, we must not be afraid of hardship, and we must take the lead in working hard." The township is now replanting late-maturing, water-resistant crops. At the same time, with the support of the government, sideline production has been restored.

### 再接再厉战胜灾荒  沐阳双窑乡支部的生产自救工作

　　再接再厉战胜灾荒
    沐阳双窑乡支部的生产自救工作
    双窑乡是苏北淮阴专区沐阳县的一个重灾乡。该乡地势低洼，五年连淹八次，尤以去年水灾为最大，秋禾无收，春麦仅收三成。加之过去蒋匪抢劫、破坏，至去年十二月间，全乡一千零五十四户中，就有九百八十户断炊，占全户数的百分之九十以上。但在该乡支部领导下，发动群众生产自救，使灾情缩小，并在初步战胜灾荒的基础上，进行春耕春种。
    整顿党内思想，扭转消极情绪。
    去年十一月间，当该乡灾情发展最严重的时候，党员与群众，曾普遍产生消极情绪，依赖政府救济。中共支委陈树三听说救灾头就痛。党员陶定华说：“这样大的灾，怎救得了，你们有办法，我可没办法。”南板村村长陈崙看见灾民找他，他就要求辞职，不做村长。该乡中共支部书记陈家乐在这种严重的情况下，当即召开了支部大会，首先对党员进行党的教育，提出：“共产党员应想办法，领导群众克服困难，战胜灾荒。”同时启发大家回忆过去几年中渡荒经验，树立党员自救信心。最后讨论结果，一致认为：要把生产救灾工作搞好，首先党员要树立信心，并在工作中起带头与保证作用，团结推动各种力量，组织副业生产，加上政府救济，是有办法渡过灾荒的。会上并决定了每个党员要帮助一家到三家灾户解决困难，帮助订生产救灾计划。
    组织力量，克服困难，开展副业生产，缩小灾情。
    支部大会以后，又分别召开青年团员大会，各界代表会，分村群众大会，反复说明只要大家积极生产，救灾就有办法。会上并表扬了生产自救的模范，批评与教育了个别懒汉。在各界代表会上，并根据当地副业生产的习惯，着重讨论了组织拐粉条的办法。订出组织五十盘的计划，由政府帮助三十五盘，其余发动群众互助。会后，在全乡干部、党员、团员带头下，及时帮助灾民解决了拐粉资本、劳力等困难，五十盘粉磨很快全部行动起来。这时支部又决定了让拐粉有经验的党员王长春、李永波等经常去各粉坊小组检查，帮助改进技术，提高产量。如戚豆村陈树祥拐粉组因技术不高，第一次蚀掉二斗豌豆，经王长春帮助后，第二次获利除弥补上次亏本外，还赚一斗六升。拐粉组群众见了王长春，都高兴的说：“我们有了老王就有办法。”在其他副业方面，党员也都起了带头推动作用。戚豆村党员严善培组织三十余人?鱼，换得粮四石二斗，每人分到一斗多。顾洼村党员常宝凡家订了生产自救的计划以后，本人与老婆参加拐粉，女儿上午纺纱，下午拾草。在他影响下，该村四十余户灾民也纷纷订计划，小孩每天出外拾草，半个月共拾到四万余斤，且推动了全乡灾户小孩拾草。女党员仲玉兰也组织了七个妇女?鱼五百一十斤，换到秫秫四百二十斤，并组织十六户拐粉。
    经过了六十天的努力，至今年二月初，一千余人参加了副业生产，全乡无一断炊户，过去饿得变了脸色的灾民因有粉渣浆吃，脸色全都恢复了。
    再接再厉，渡过雨雪难关，进行春种。
    春节前后，接连阴雨下雪，粉条无法晒，因此粉磨暂停三十四盘。?鱼等副业也被迫停止。全乡灾情随又发展，计有七十八户断炊。该乡支书陈家乐同志与乡长讨论决定，立即召开村以上干部、党员会议，商量紧急抢救。号召好干部好党员，要经得起雨雪关头的严重考验。会上表扬了两个月来在生产救灾中工作有显著成绩的二十六个干部、党员。随即分赴各村查灾急救，发动社会互济。在干部、党员带头下，全乡共借出一千七百二十斤粮，同时政府也拨来七百斤急救粮，发下六百斤第一阶段扒河（沂河）工资粮，接上口粮，继续进行各种副业生产，因而，灾情随又缩小，断炊户很快消除。
    三月间春种开始，支部又以原有的拐粉组做基础，领导群众组织起一百七十个互组小组，进行春种。这样解决了劳力缺乏的困难，同时又帮助解决了部分灾民春种中吃粮问题。如南坂村章祥生小组，能劳动的人除参加春种外，并又专门留下四人在家拐粉。使每家在春种中仍然能吃到渣浆，保持了灾民的体力。对烈军工属及无劳动力户，又组织了代耕；扒河民工家属，组织换工、帮工。至四月上旬，全乡一万二千亩春田，大部下种。
    再度动员起来，战胜四月暴雨。
    四月中旬，连续暴雨，全乡一万二千亩春田大部被淹，各项副业生产也被迫停顿，灾情又有新的发展。干部和群众中产生了新的消极情绪。这时，该乡支部在上级党委的领导下，立即领导党员和群众抢救排水。经过七八天努力，使大部春田得救。但麦田被淹后，大部减产。针对这一情况，支部提出：“救灾要做长期打算，要不怕艰苦，带头干。”现该乡正在补种晚熟耐水庄稼。同时在政府支持下，重新恢复了副业生产。
