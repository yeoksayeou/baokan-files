Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions recently issued a notice regarding mobilizing trade union organizations and the broad masses of workers in all regions to discuss the Draft Trade Union Law, stating:

　　The Draft Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China is one of the greatest revolutionary achievements attained by the Chinese working class in the past thirty years under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. The Draft Trade Union Law clearly stipulates the legal status and responsibilities of trade union organizations under the New Democratic regime, and fully guarantees the freedom of the Chinese working class in organizing trade unions and other political activities. This is an unprecedented major event in the history of the Chinese labor movement, and it deserves the enthusiastic support and celebration of the working class nationwide. In order to further improve the Trade Union Law, the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, before the Central People's Government Committee makes its final revisions and passes the Trade Union Law, has decided to publish the Draft Trade Union Law first in order to absorb opinions from all sides and make final revisions. Leading organs and responsible comrades of trade union organizations in various regions and industries should, based on the Draft Trade Union Law promulgated by Xinhua News Agency on the 29th and the Worker's Daily editorial published on the same day, "Two Major Documents Concerning Labor Policy," conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda and launch heated discussions within trade union organizations and among the broad masses of workers in factories, mines, shops, government agencies, farms, schools, etc. The propaganda situation and discussion opinions should be written into a written report and submitted to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions before the end of May.

　　全国总工会发出通知
    发动各地工会组织及广大工人群众讨论工会法草案
    【新华社六日讯】中华全国总工会顷发出关于发动各地工会组织及广大工人群众讨论工会法草案的通知称：
    中华人民共和国工会法草案是三十年来中国工人阶级在中国共产党与毛主席的英明领导下，所获得的最大的革命成果之一。在工会法草案中明确地规定了在新民主主义的政权下工会组织的法律地位与职责，充分地保障了中国工人阶级在组织工会与其他政治活动方面的自由权利。这是中国工人运动史上空前未有的一件大事情，是值得全国工人阶级热烈拥护与庆祝的。中央人民政府政务院为了使工会法更臻完善起见，在中央人民政府委员会对于工会法未作最后修正通过前，故将工会法草案，先予发表，以便吸收各方面的意见，作最后的修正。各地区与产业工会组织的领导机关与负责同志，应根据新华社二十九日所公布的工会法草案及同日工人日报所发表的社论《有关劳动政策的两大文件》，在工厂、矿山、商店、机关、农场、学校等工会组织内与广大工人群众中进行广泛而深入的宣传，展开热烈的讨论，并将宣传的情况与讨论的意见，于五月底以前，写成书面报告寄交中华全国总工会。
