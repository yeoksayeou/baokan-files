　　To Improve the Sanitary Environment for the Working People
    Renovation Project of Dragon Beard Ditch Begins
    [Beijing Municipal News Agency] The project to excavate and renovate Dragon Beard Ditch began on the 16th. This project is divided into two construction zones that started simultaneously: Construction Zone 1 is responsible for the conversion of open ditches into covered culverts from Jin Yu Chi (Goldfish Pond) Street west to Dong Dadi (East Big Land) to Si Kuai Yu (Four Jade Pieces) Ming Ditch, the construction of new covered culverts from Xiao Shi (Dawn Market) Street west to Dong Dadi, and the dredging of the lower reaches of Dragon Beard Ditch; Construction Zone 2 is responsible for the conversion of open ditches into covered culverts from Jin Yu Chi Street east to Tian Qiao (Bridge of Heaven) East First Alley, and the dredging of Ming Ditch on Yongnei (Eternal Inside) Street. Work has now begun first on parts of Yongdingmen Nei (Inside Yongding Gate) Street and the area south of Dong Dadi. The entire project is expected to be completed by the end of July.
    The Dragon Beard Ditch project is the most important of this year's sewer projects, because more than 80 percent of the residents outside the city rely on the Dragon Beard Ditch to dispose of sewage. However, this open ditch has been neglected for many years, has a very small capacity, and is therefore filled with a lot of garbage, sewage, feces, and decaying debris, etc. It not only obstructs traffic, but also has a strong odor and easily spreads disease. These situations are especially serious during the rainy season, which has a great impact on the health of citizens. The residents near Dragon Beard Ditch are very happy to see the dredging of the Dragon Beard Ditch. An old woman said, "There will be no more odor after the ditch is repaired. Our government is really thoughtful. If it were the Kuomintang! Don't even think about asking them to fix the ditch for you. If you came here, they would be disgusted by the smell."

　　为劳动人民改善卫生环境
    改建龙须沟工程开始
    【京市新闻处讯】掏挖和改建龙须沟的工程已于十六日开工。此项工程分两个工区同时开工：一工区负责金鱼池大街以西东大地到四块玉明沟改建暗沟工程，晓市大街以西到东大地新建暗沟工程，以及龙须沟下游疏浚工程；二工区负责金鱼池大街以东，天桥东一巷明沟改建暗沟工程及永内大街明沟疏浚工程。现在已经首先在永定门内大街部分及东大地以南部分开工，全部工程预计可于七月底前完成。
    龙须沟工程是今年下水道工程中最重要的一项，因为外城百分之八十以上的居民消纳秽水都要靠龙须沟来解决，但这条明沟由于多年失修，容量很小，所以淤积许多垃圾、秽水、粪便及腐朽杂物等，不但有碍交通，且臭味很大，极易传播病疫，这些情况一到雨季尤其严重，对市民健康影响很大。这次龙须沟附近的居民看见疏浚龙须沟。都非常高兴，一个老太太说：“沟修好后再不会有臭味了，真亏我们的政府想得周到。要是国民党呀！你别想叫他给你修沟。上这来，人家还嫌臭的不行呢。”
