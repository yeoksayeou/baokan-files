(This Newspaper News) The Ministry of Communications of the Central People's Government is currently conducting a widespread inventory of warehouse materials. According to recent reports from various regions and the results of inspections by dispatched personnel, the following are some good examples: 1. After receiving the instructions from the Ministry, the Xingang Engineering Bureau immediately conducted dissemination, mobilization, arrangement, and discussion and research, formulated detailed plans. Due to the increased awareness of all employees, they actively proposed challenge competitions and mutually guaranteed the completion of tasks, creating a stocktaking surge. The No. 2 Ship Repair Factory of the Bureau was very busy with ship repair business, and the workers automatically worked overtime for one hour every morning; other workers and staff in the Materials Section, Shipping Section, and various work areas also voluntarily worked overtime. Valuable equipment was discovered every day. Recently, 48 ships, a resistor, and many assets such as steel wire ropes and square timber piles were cleared out, even steel materials left over from the Qing Dynasty more than 40 years ago were thoroughly cleared out. The No. 1 Ship Repair Factory also discovered more than 30 machine tools. The workers also launched a movement to hand in and inspect materials. The first warehouse was filled with important materials, tools, parts, etc., and seven temporary material storage yards were added. The workers also brushed off rust and oiled the rusted steel equipment at any time, and the engineers checked and sorted them item by item, put them into the warehouse, and marked them with new material labels, laying the foundation for future material management. The situation reports collected daily through wall newspapers and communications promoted the work, and continuously improved the work efficiency of various departments. For example, for the sorting of cement (unpacking, sieving, bagging, and weighing), each person used to do only 500 kilograms per day, but now each person can do 1,633 kilograms per day, more than twice as much as usual; for carrying iron bars (distance of 200 meters), after four days of competition, each person increased from 1.5 tons to 4.5 tons per day. 2. The Beijing General Warehouse of the State-owned Automobile Transportation Corporation is very enthusiastic about the stocktaking work. The warehouse, which was generally thought to take half a year to complete the stocktaking, was finally completed in one month and five days. In terms of material identification, they have prepared "tool" and "material" analysis tables for each automobile license plate material, totaling 675 items, identifying the use, department, and the amount of obsolete materials, which will play a great role in future material allocation. During the stocktaking process, they found that one-fifth of the old waste materials and scrap iron were new and good materials, such as some complete pistons, gaskets, tires, and chains. Some materials with a large demand and a shortage in the market, such as connecting rod nuts, were also cleared out in miscellaneous materials. At the same time, the shackles of the accounts were broken, and what should be cleared out from the accounts was cleared out, and the actual inventory was seriously checked. This spirit is worth learning by other warehouses. 3. The Dagukou Shipyard of the Tianjin Merchants Bureau has carried out more thorough ideological mobilization. After repeated discussions and arrangements by the administration, the Party, the League, and the trade union, even more than 200 students from the children's primary school and the workers' families automatically participated in the collection of old waste materials. Such in-depth mobilization played a powerful guarantee role in completing the task. At the same time, the method of valuation is relatively good. A valuation team was established, headed by the deputy manager and the head of the accounting section of the bureau, specializing in handling valuation issues. It is planned to first set a material unit price list. As soon as the materials are counted, they will be calculated and filled in item by item according to the identified components. At the same time, if the inventory personnel have a considerable understanding of the value of a certain material, they will attach a note to the value for the valuation team to refer to and evaluate. This two-pronged valuation method can reduce difficulties and increase effectiveness. 4. Among the provincial institutions, the Transportation Bureau of the Shanxi Provincial Government has been the most active and rapid. In the middle and upper part of April, the business department team had completed 80% to 90% of the stocktaking of 81 equipment warehouses, and completed the stocktaking of 293 scrapped vehicles. The repair and manufacturing factory team has cleared out the materials in the warehouse, and is now starting to clear out the scrap materials outside the warehouse; the transportation company team has also completed one-third of the stocktaking work.

　　交通部新港工程局等单位
    全体职工展开清仓热潮   
    造成今后材料管理和调拨的便利条件
    【本报讯】中央人民政府交通部清理仓库物资工作，目前已普遍开展。据最近各地汇报和派员检查的结果，发现以下几个较好的例子：一、新港工程局自接该部训令后，即进行传达、动员、布置和讨论研究，拟定详密计划，全体职工由于认识提高，主动提出挑战竞赛，互相保证完成任务，造成了清仓热潮。该局修船第二厂因修船业务很忙，工人们每晨自动加班一小时；其他如材料科、船舶科和各工区等工人职员，亦均自动加班，每天都有完好的、有价值的器材发现，最近清查出四十八条船只，一部抵抗器和钢丝绳、方木木桩等许多资产，甚至四十余年前满清时代遗留下的钢铁等材料也彻底清查出来。修船第一厂还发现了三十多部工作母机。工人们并掀起了交料检料运动，重要材料、工具、零件等把第一库堆满不算，还临时增设了七个堆料场。锈了的钢铁器材工友们又随时刷锈上油，并由工程师们逐项检定，整理入库，标以新料牌，给今后材料管理打下了基础。由于壁报和通讯，每天搜集情况报道，推动了工作，使各部分工作效率不断提高，如整理洋灰（拆袋过筛装包过磅），平日每人每天只做五百公斤，现在每人每天可做一千六百三十三公斤，超过平日两倍多；抬运元铁棍（距离二○○米），经过四天竞赛，每天每人由一吨半，增加到四吨半。二、国营汽车运输总公司的北京总仓库对于清理工作的热情很高，以前一般认为半年都清理不完的仓库，终在一个月另五天内清理结束。材料鉴定方面，他们已作出“工具”、“材料”及各汽车车牌材料分析表，共达六百七十五项，鉴别出各料用途、使用部门和一些呆旧料的存量程度，这对以后材料调拨上将起很大作用。在清理过程中，他们在旧废料和废铁堆中发现了五分之一是新料和好料，如一些完整的活塞、纸垫、轮胎和练条等。在杂项材料中并清查出一些需用量很大而市面上又很缺的材料，如连杆螺丝母等。同时打破账本的束缚，该从账上清理出去的就清理出去，实事求是的去认真清点，这种精神值得其他仓库学习。三、天津招商局大沽修船厂思想动员得比较彻底，经过行政和党、团、工会的反复讨论布置，连子弟小学二百余学生和工人眷属们都自动的来参加收集旧废料工作。这样的深入动员，对完成任务起了有力的保证作用。同时，在估价方面的办法比较好，成立了一个估价小组，由该局副理和会计科长负责，专门处理估价问题，预备先订出一个材料单价表，一俟物资清点完毕，即逐件依照检定成份，加以折算填列，同时清点人员如对某项物资价值有相当认识的，就把价值附注以备估价组参考评议，这样双方并进的估价办法，可以减少困难，增加效能。四、省属机构中要以山西省政府交通局做得积极而又迅速。该局在四月上中旬业务处小组即已完成清理八十一个器材库的十分之八九，并完成了废旧车二百九十三辆的清理工作，修造厂小组已把库内物资清完，现开始清理库外废旧物资；运输公司小组也已完成三分之一的清理工作。
