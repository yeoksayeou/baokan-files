　　Handan District Plants Over Three Million Mu of Cotton
    Accounting for One-Sixteenth of the National Cotton Planting Plan
    Strive to Sell 100 Million Jin of Ginned Cotton This Year
    [Handan Communication] Hebei Province's Handan District is expected to plant three million mu of cotton. It has already completed 3,184,283 mu, which accounts for over a quarter of Hebei Province's cotton planting plan and one-sixteenth of the national cotton planting plan. This exceeds the province's assigned cotton planting task (2.1 million mu) by 1,084,000 mu, and represents an increase of 1.48 million mu compared to last year's cotton planting. In paddy field areas, dibbling is now being carried out in wheat fields. After the autumn cotton harvest, based on last year's situation and taking into account this year's technological improvements, it is estimated that 100 million jin of ginned cotton will be sold, in addition to the amount used by the masses for their own needs. This year's expansion of cotton fields will not only increase farmers' income and gradually lead them to prosperity, but also make an important contribution to supplying raw materials for national industry. The all-out cotton planting campaign in the entire district, which began on April 16th and ended on April 25th, has basically concluded. Its characteristic is the unprecedented high enthusiasm of the masses for cotton planting, and the expansion of cotton planting has become a conscious action of the broad masses. The sowing time was advanced by more than twenty days compared to last year, and superior varieties were promoted. The tense, rapid, and smooth completion of the cotton planting campaign in the entire district, exceeding the task, is mainly due to the following reasons: (1) Long-term and sufficient preparatory work. First, in-depth ideological mobilization. As early as last autumn, during the harvest and comparison of crops movement, the masses were educated with actual harvests: "To get rich, plant cotton, benefit yourself, benefit the country." Cotton fields were reserved when planting wheat. In particular, through people's representatives from all walks of life, all cadres, and Party members, the cotton price policy and burden policy were vigorously publicized, dispelling the masses' ideological obstacles to expanding cotton planting. The masses were educated with practical examples that "one mu of cotton is equivalent to three mu of grain" and "a little calculation shows that planting cotton is truly better than planting grain." Second, the cotton planting plan was implemented down to the household through year-end family discussion meetings and "household group meetings," ensuring the realization of the plan. In terms of material preparation, the masses were mobilized during spring plowing to harrow the cotton fields one or two more times. For example, in Feixiang's Fourth District, 40,000 mu of cotton fields were generally harrowed five times. The masses were mobilized to exchange and borrow superior varieties. Cooperatives in each county lent the masses 7 million jin of cotton seeds and 41 million jin of fertilizer. Jize and Wu'an also lent the masses 114 seed drills; Feixiang used ordinary drills to modify many seed drills to solve the practical difficulties of the masses. Another major inspection was carried out before sowing to prompt the masses to prepare properly, waiting only for sowing. This laid a solid ideological and material foundation for the cotton planting campaign.
    (2) Seize the season and concentrate all efforts to carry out a blitz. The experience of "sowing early rather than late" was used and developed. Immediately after the Qingming Festival, the Handan Prefectural Commissioner's Office and the CCP Prefectural Committee issued the "Instruction to Quickly Strengthen Preparation and Enter the Blitz Sowing." Subsequently, 600 cadres were extracted, together with 200 cadres from the provincial working team, totaling 800 cadres, and dispatched to key cotton planting counties. Each county also sent a large number of cadres, one per village, to go deep into each village for specific leadership, promoting various organized forces (CCP branches, Communist Youth League, women's federations, militia, mutual aid teams, elementary schools, etc.). Each village organized a blitz cotton planting committee, convened various meetings, and vigorously publicized and mobilized. Blackboards and radio broadcasts were used to carry out commendations and encouragement, singing cotton planting songs, and mobilizing work went deep into households. The benefits of early planting were explained, and the fact that transportation is now convenient and there will be no shortage of grain was explained, using the example of the large amount of grain transferred from Handan to dispel the masses' concerns about not having enough grain. The masses were helped to find ways to plant more millet and alfalfa in wheat stubble to overcome the masses' concerns about livestock not having enough grass. The masses' self-sufficiency circles were broken through, and the cotton planting area was expanded. The work-point system, contract system, and subcontracting system were used to first solve the cotton planting difficulties of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers' families, and mutual aid teams were vigorously organized to solve the difficulties of lacking manpower, animal power, seeds, and seed drills, especially the cotton planting difficulties of the elderly, weak, orphans, and childless households. The goal of "people, animals, and farm implements never idle" was achieved. Handan's Fourth District alone organized 1,568 mutual aid teams. Other departments also actively cooperated and acted. The government issued a notice guaranteeing eight to ten jin of rice per jin of ginned cotton, and cooperatives signed contracts with the masses to purchase cotton. Just as villages were preparing to seize the opportunity to dibble sow, there was a thorough rain on the 14th and 15th. Cadres and Party members braved the rain to check and help from door to door, prepare seeds, and mobilize to increase the plan. After the rain, a vigorous all-out cotton planting campaign was launched in the entire district. Farmers, men and women, old and young, all joined in this cotton planting craze. During the blitz cotton planting, CCP rural Party members took the lead in planting more. For example, in Qiuxian's Malan Village, 25 Party members had a total of 319 mu of barren land. Except for 5 mu of melon fields, all were planted with cotton. Many masses did not have enough barren land to plant, so they dibbled in wheat fields. For example, Xin Zhuangpu in Yongnian County dibbled 400 mu of cotton in wheat fields, exceeding the village's cotton planting plan of 600 mu. Many masses not only planted more themselves but also enthusiastically mobilized and persuaded others to plant more. For example, Song Dailiang of Liu Han Village in Yongnian made a big profit from planting 20 mu of cotton last year, harvesting 3,100 jin of cotton. This time, when planting cotton, he actively mobilized others to plant more. He said to a household that went to plant sorghum: "Haven't you had enough red sorghum buns! Look at me, I made a big profit from planting cotton last year, built a house and bought a donkey, and now I live very well and don't eat red sorghum buns anymore." A farmer in the Fifth District of Linqing County was carrying a drill to plant millet when he heard that the government issued a notice guaranteeing cotton prices, so he changed to planting cotton. After the cotton planting campaign was launched, Wu'an planted 370,000 mu of cotton in three days, exceeding the task by 50,000 mu; Feixiang planted 134,000 mu of cotton in three days, exceeding the task by 15,000 mu.
    Although the entire district's cotton planting was completed quickly and smoothly, a few districts and villages, due to insufficient preparation, especially the cotton planting plan not being fully implemented to households, and coupled with the cadres' simple task viewpoint, caused coercive orders to occur in individual villages during the blitz cotton planting. For example, in individual villages in Quzhou, each person was assigned to plant one and a half mu of cotton, and in individual villages in Linqing, the masses were prohibited from planting grain. After discovering these deviations, the Handan Prefectural Committee immediately telegraphed each county to strictly correct and prevent them. In places where coercive orders had occurred, explanations and self-criticisms were made to the masses to make up for the losses. Now that the entire district's cotton planting is nearing completion, the Prefectural Committee has instructed each county to summarize cotton planting from bottom to top, elect model cotton planting villages, households, and individuals, as well as model cadres leading cotton planting. Through summarizing, arrange the next stage of work, educate the masses to continue to carry out a series of cotton seedling protection work, improve technology, and prevent and control diseases and insect pests, so that cotton grows well and grows more, so as to ensure planting and harvest.

　　邯郸区种棉三百多万亩
    占全国种棉计划十六分之一 
    争取今年出售皮棉一万万斤
    【邯郸通信】河北省邯郸专区预计种棉三百万亩，已完成三百一十八万四千二百八十三亩，种棉面积占河北省种棉计划四分之一强，占全国种棉计划十六分之一。超过该省布置种棉任务（二百一十万亩）一百○八万四千亩，比去年种棉数增加一百四十八万亩。水田区现在进行麦垅点种。秋后收棉，按去年情况估计加上今年技术的改进，除群众自用外，争取出售皮棉一万万斤。今年棉田的扩大，不仅会使农民增加收入，逐步走向富裕，而对供给国家工业原料有其重要供献。全专区突击种棉运动于四月十六日起至二十五日止已基本结束，其特点是群众种棉情绪空前高涨，扩大种棉已成为广大群众自觉的行动。播种时间比去年提早二十余天，并推广了优良品种。全专区种棉运动紧张、迅速、顺利的完成并超过任务，其主要原因：（一）有长期而充分的准备工作。首先是深入的思想动员，远在去年秋收比庄稼运动中，即已用实际收获教育了群众：“要发家，种棉花，利自己，利国家”。种麦时留出棉田。特别是通过各界人民代表及全体干部和党员，大力宣传棉价政策，负担政策，解除群众扩大种棉思想阻碍，用实际例子教育群众“一亩棉三亩田”，“打打算盘合合账，种棉真比种粮强”。其次是通过年关家庭座谈会、“片户会”把种棉计划贯彻到户，使计划实现有了保证。在物质准备上，春耕中发动群众将棉地多耙一、二遍，如肥乡四区四万亩棉田普耙过五遍。动员群众互换互借准备优良品种。各县合作社贷给群众棉种七百万斤，肥料四千一百万斤。鸡泽、武安还贷给群众耩花耧一百一十四张；肥乡用一般耧改造了不少耩花耧，以解决群众实际困难。播种前又进行一次准备种棉大检查，促使群众准备妥当，只待播种。这样给种棉运动打下了有力的思想基础，物质基础。
    （二）抓紧季节，集中全力进行突击。运用与发展了播种赶早不赶晚的经验。“清明”刚过，邯郸专署，中共地委即发出“迅即加强准备与进入突击播种的指示”，随即抽出六百名干部连同省工作队二百名干部共八百名干部，分赴各植棉重点县，各县也都派大批干部，每村一人深入各村具体领导，推动各种有组织的力量（中共支部、青年团、妇女会、民兵、互助组、小学等），村村组织突击种棉委员会，召开各种会议，大力宣传动员。通过黑板报、广播筒进行表扬鼓动，唱种棉歌，动员工作深入到户。讲明早种的好处，及现在交通方便不会缺粮，用现在邯郸调来大批粮食为例证，解除群众怕没粮吃的顾虑。帮助群众想办法，多种麦茬谷子、苜蓿，克服群众怕牲口没草吃的困难。突破群众自给自足圈子，扩大种棉面积。用工票制、包干制、包工制，首先解决烈、军、工属的种棉困难，并大力组织互助组，解决缺乏人力、畜力、种籽、耩花耧的困难，特别是老弱孤户的种棉困难。做到“人、畜、农具三不闲”。仅邯郸四区就组织起互助组一千五百六十八个。其他各部门也都积极配合行动，政府出布告保证一斤皮棉八斤至十斤米，合作社与群众订立合同收购棉花。正当村村准备抢墒点种的时候，十四、十五两日普落透雨，干部和党员即冒雨挨门逐户检查帮助，准备种籽，动员提高计划。雨后，全区掀起热火朝天的突击种棉运动，棉区农民男女老少一齐卷入这一种棉热潮。突击种棉中，中共农村党员带头多种，如邱县马兰村二十五名党员，共有白地三百一十九亩，除五亩瓜地外，全都种上棉花。很多群众白地不够种，便向麦垅内点种。如永年县辛庄堡向麦垅点棉四百亩，超过全村种棉六百亩的计划。许多群众不但自己多种，还热情的动员说服别人多种。如永年刘汉村宋代良，去年种棉二十亩，收棉花三千一百斤得了大利，此次种棉时积极动员别人多种，他对一户去种高粱的说：“你还没吃够红粮窝吗！看我去年种棉得了大利，盖了房又买了驴，现在生活很好，不吃红窝头了。”临清县五区一个农民背着耧去种谷子，听到政府出布告保证棉价又改种棉花。种棉运动开展起来后，武安三天内种棉三十七万亩，超过任务五万亩；肥乡三天种棉十三万四千亩，超过任务一万五千亩。
    虽全区种棉迅速顺利的完成了，但有少数区村因准备不够，特别是种棉计划没全部贯彻到户，再加干部的单纯任务观点，致使个别村庄突击种棉时发生强迫命令现象。如曲周个别村每人派种棉花一亩半，临清个别村禁止群众种粮。邯郸地委发现这些偏向后，随时电告各县严格纠正与防止，已发生强迫命令的地方，要向群众解释作自我批评，弥补损失。现全区种棉已接近结束，该地委指示各县从下而上总结种棉，选举种棉模范村、户、人，及领导种棉的模范干部，通过总结布置下段工作，教育群众今后继续进行一系列的保护棉苗工作，提高技术，防治病虫害，使棉花长的好，长的多，作到保种保收。（邯郸地委办公室通讯组，卢少田执笔）
