Financial and Economic Briefs

　　In order to improve work efficiency and business level, the Liaoxi Branch of the Northeast Bank launched a movement to create new records in banking work. Before the movement began, the branch conducted reports on creating new records and evaluated the highest and lowest standards of work. To ensure the smooth implementation of this movement, a New Record Creation Movement Committee was organized, with inspection and commendation groups under it. The New Record Movement is scheduled to run from March 10th to July 15th. Now everyone has a new transformation in their work, and work efficiency has generally improved. In the accounting department, the time it took to complete the procedures for each remittance was previously three minutes, but now it only takes one minute and four seconds at the fastest. The work of the treasury management, which used to require four people, now only requires one person.

    东北银行辽西分行为提高工作效率与业务水平，展开了银行工作的创新纪录运动。该行在运动展开之前曾进行了有关创新纪录的报告文件，并评出工作最高与最低的标准。为慎重开展此一运动起见，并组织了创新纪录运动委员会，下设检查、表扬两组。新纪录运动时间规定自三月十日起到七月十五日止。现每个人在工作上都有了新的转变，工作效率亦已普遍提高。会计科收汇每办完一笔汇款的手续，过去需时三分钟，现在最快仅需一分四秒。金库管理工作过去四个人的工作，现在只要一个人就作了。（许阿雷）
