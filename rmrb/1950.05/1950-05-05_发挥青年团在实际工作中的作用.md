　　Give Play to the Role of the Youth League in Practical Work
　　Jiang Nanxiang
    After developing the organization of the Youth League, how to consolidate it is the most important and fundamental issue. Now, many Youth League organizations are voicing this call: "Development is easy, consolidation is difficult."

    Some places blindly copy the methods of "rectification" and "party consolidation," implementing "league consolidation" behind closed doors. This approach is incorrect.

    The consolidation work of the League should not be separated from, but should be combined with, the central work of the Party and the People's Government.

    The Youth League is established to play a role in practical work. The extent to which the League plays a role in practical work is the only correct indicator of the degree of consolidation of the League. If the League can play a role in practical work, then it proves that the League is consolidated; if the League cannot play a role in practical work, then it proves that the League is not consolidated. At the same time, the League organization can only strengthen itself and become more powerful in the practical struggle to complete the central tasks of the Party and the People's Government.

    How can we better give play to the role of the League?

    (1) All Youth League organizations must take the specific central work of the Party and the People's Government as their central work.

    Some Youth League organizations initially did not clearly recognize this point and ran into obstacles. For example, the Youth League in rural areas and factories does not take strengthening production as its central work; the Youth League in schools does not take strengthening learning as its central work; they are too busy with "League affairs," busy with meetings, singing games, and cultural and recreational work, resulting in detachment from the masses. There was a rural Youth League organization in Heilongjiang that organized members to study culture at home during the busy farming season. The parents became very angry and kicked them out.

    Taking the central work of the Communist Party and the People's Government as our own central work requires not only ideological recognition but also practical implementation in specific work arrangements. The organizational form and working methods of the League also need to be subordinate to and serve the completion of this central work. Some Youth League organizations in factories and schools, although they also abstractly acknowledge the importance of production and learning, have not been able to implement this understanding in practical work. They still have too many meetings and various extra activities unrelated to the central task, resulting in the problem remaining unsolved. Truth must be embodied through practice; abstract recognition has no practical significance.

    There is another issue that must be clarified, that is, the role that the Youth League plays in various practical work is that of an assistant to the Party and the People's Government. It cannot and should not be required to be equal to the role of the Communist Party and the People's Government. This means placing the role that the Youth League can play in an appropriate position, neither underestimating it nor overestimating it. Some Youth League organizations do not understand or do not fully understand the League's "assistant role," regarding the Youth League not only as the leading core of the youth movement, but also as the leading core of the entire people's revolutionary movement. They hope that the League will have its own separate and prominent performance in various tasks, wanting to take the lead in everything. In schools, they want to replace the administration and lead the reform of the academic system and curriculum; in factories, without coordinating with the entire workers' movement and production movement, they want the League to independently carry out a broad campaign to select young labor models; in rural areas, there are even individual Youth League branches that, due to slight achievements in work, become conceited and openly challenge the Party branch, believing that "the League is better than the Party." These are all incorrect exaggerations of the League's role. This approach not only makes the League organization prone to committing adventurist errors in its work, detaching itself from the masses, but also easily leads to discouragement and disappointment among League members due to practical infeasibility, or excessive fatigue and damage to the health of League members. Under the direct leadership of the Party, as a loyal assistant to the Party and the People's Government—this is the League's goal and working principle. If we deviate from this principle, the League will make mistakes in its work.

    (2) The League's organizations at all levels should pay attention to strengthening the League's education work. First, conduct ideological and political education on Marxism-Leninism; second, conduct cultural and technical education related to professional work.

    Conducting ideological and political education on Marxism-Leninism naturally requires guiding League members to read Marxist-Leninist books, study Chairman Mao's important works and the important policies of the Chinese Communist Party, and learn some basic knowledge about the Youth League; but more importantly, it is to combine theory with practice; to promote achievements, overcome shortcomings, and do things well in various practical activities such as work, production, combat, and learning, guiding League members and the broad masses of young people to better serve the people. It is to cultivate the collective spirit and a conscious attitude toward labor (including a conscious attitude toward work and learning) among League members in practical struggles.

    Collectivism is the opposite of individualism. It is the ideological foundation of selfless dedication and mutual cooperation in work. A conscious attitude toward labor is the opposite of a hired attitude. It is the original driving force for giving play to the initiative and creativity in all work, and for carrying out the great cause of serving the people. Without the spirit of collectivism and a conscious attitude toward labor, it is impossible to do the work well, and only possible to lead the work to failure. Therefore, we should take cultivating the collective spirit and a conscious attitude toward labor among League members as the main topic of the League's ideological and political education, which is more important than simply reading Marxist-Leninist books.

    Cultivating the collective spirit means cultivating our overall view in life and work, and being able to correctly handle the relationship between the individual and the organization, the part and the whole, when solving all practical problems, so that minor principles are subordinate to major principles. In international affairs, we are internationalists, resolutely supporting the peace camp headed by the Soviet Union, and opposing narrow nationalism. In Chinese politics, we are patriots who love the people's motherland, resolutely supporting the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, and opposing harmful actions that only consider local interests and harm the united front. In practical work, we must be models of obeying the organization and observing discipline; the interests of the individual are unconditionally subordinate to the interests of the organization and the interests of the entire people. All of this is a concrete manifestation of the overall concept. Therefore, education in internationalism, education in patriotism, and education in organization and discipline are all important educational content for cultivating the spirit of collectivism.

    Establishing a conscious attitude toward labor (including the attitude toward work and the attitude toward learning) means promoting our initiative in all work, which is an indispensable factor for doing any work well. There can be no conscious attitude toward labor under the lash of chains and clubs. To inspire initiative in work, the work must be in line with the purpose of justice, so that everyone can have a conscious sense of responsibility and improve their sense of ownership; that is to say, work must have a democratic spirit. In addition, subjective initiative cannot be built on mere enthusiasm, but must be based on the scientific guidance of Marxism-Leninism. Only when we fully understand the laws of social development and the laws of the development of the Chinese revolution can we confidently move forward correctly; when we do any work, we must also understand its specific laws and see its development prospects clearly in order to truly and fully grasp the initiative in the work. —The democratic spirit and the scientific spirit are two important links in cultivating a correct attitude toward labor or work.

    Conducting cultural and technical education to improve the cultural and technical level of young people is another indispensable and important part of the League's education. If young League members in rural areas have culture, they can read books and newspapers themselves, absorb more new knowledge, and therefore do a better job of improving production and propaganda and education in rural areas. If young League members in factories or troops have culture and better technology, they can become skilled workers or soldiers and make more contributions to production and combat.

    As a result of thousands of years of feudal rule, China's current culture is backward. Illiteracy still accounts for the vast majority of the population nationwide, and scientific research is still very underdeveloped. Under these circumstances, vigorously advocating and promoting cultural and technical education among young people has far-reaching significance. If we do not eliminate cultural backwardness in China, the improvement of our national wisdom and the development of social productive forces will be hindered. The Youth League has a serious responsibility in the great task of eliminating illiteracy and improving the cultural and technical level of young people in China. Young League members in rural areas and troops should actively carry out literacy campaigns in line with the current central work, and strive to eliminate illiteracy within the League in a step-by-step manner; young League members in factories and agencies should learn technology and master specialized skills on the basis of improving their culture; young League members in universities and colleges should strive to use the ideological weapon of Marxism-Leninism, concentrate on studying, and delve into the hall of new knowledge, just as Stalin instructed Soviet youth: to seize the fortress of science. The Youth League organization should become an important force on China's cultural front.

    Ideological and political education and cultural and technical education are not completely separate but are interconnected. Ideological and political education is the foundation of education within the League, and also a necessary prerequisite for ensuring the healthy development of cultural and technical education. In addition, the improvement of cultural and technical level not only represents the growth of practical business ability, but also helps to establish a higher level of ideological and political awareness. "Which should be the focus of education within the League?" That should be specifically determined according to the current work needs. In the land reform movement, we must naturally emphasize ideological and political education first; in factories and schools in the old liberated areas that have undergone a certain ideological transformation, we must naturally focus on cultural and technical education. But no matter when and under what circumstances, it is necessary to pay attention to correctly implementing the principles of ideological and political education.

    Strengthening the League's regular education work is to cultivate the excellent revolutionary qualities of League members and improve their specific business capabilities, so that the Youth League can become a better assistant to the Party and the People's Government; become a more excellent reserve force for the Party.

    (3) All Youth League organizations must consolidate their ties with the broad masses.

    For the Youth League organization to play its important role, it depends not only on the strength of its own organization, but also on its broad and close ties with the broad masses.

    Why?

    Only by maintaining close ties with the broad masses can the Youth League's work correctly reflect the urgent needs of the broad masses and promptly solve the masses' immediate problems. Thus, the League organization can gain the sincere support of the broad masses, and can extensively absorb young people from all walks of life outside the League, and even some adults, to participate in the League's work and activities, obtain their assistance, and work with them to do all kinds of work better. Some rural branches of the League in Liaodong Province invited labor heroes to explain farming methods before the spring plowing, which played a great role in helping League members and young people to participate in agricultural production.

    Only by maintaining close ties with the broad masses can the positive influence of the Youth League be spread more widely among the masses, and if the Youth League's work has shortcomings or errors, it can be more easily discovered and overcome under the supervision and help of the broad masses. Contact with the masses is a necessary condition for the Youth League to lead the masses and improve its own work level. If it loses its due connection with the broad masses, it will be like a fish out of water, causing the Youth League organization to wither and preventing the role of the Youth League from being fully realized.

    Of course, as the core organization for uniting the broad masses of young people, the Youth League has the responsibility to lead the broad masses of young people outside the Youth League. But it must be understood that realizing this leading role does not rely solely on the legal status of the League—the name of the Youth League member—but on the actual work of the League and the active performance and exemplary role of all Youth League members in various practical work.

    "We are Youth League members, advanced elements, so you—the general masses of young people—should obey our—Youth League members' leadership"—this logic is completely wrong and untenable. This attitude of "arrogance" and "considering oneself advanced" can only arouse others' resentment and is by no means the attitude that Youth League members should have. Only Youth League members who set an example themselves, do their work well, are humble and sincere, and do not put on airs as advanced elements can naturally gain the trust of the masses, become one with the masses, and truly become excellent leaders of the masses. Therefore, the most fundamental issue in strengthening the League's ties with the masses is to do our own work well.

    Effectively coordinating the completion of various central tasks of the Communist Party and the People's Government; regularly carrying out practical League education work; maintaining close ties with the broad masses of young people—these are the necessary conditions for the Youth League to better play its role and consolidate its organization.

　　发挥青年团在实际工作中的作用
    蒋南翔
    发展了青年团的组织以后，如何巩固，是一个最重要最根本的问题。现在有不少青年团的组织发出这种呼声：“发展容易巩固难”。
    有些地方盲目地抄袭“整风”“整党”的办法，关起门来实行“整团”，这种做法是不对的。
    团的巩固工作，不应离开而应结合党和人民政府的中心工作来进行。
    建立青年团，是为了要它在实际工作中起作用。团在实际工作中所起的作用如何，这是团的巩固程度的唯一正确的标志。如果团在实际工作中能够起作用，那么证明这个团是巩固的；如果团在实际工作中不能起作用，那么就证明这个团是不巩固的。同时，团的组织也只有在完成党和人民政府中心任务的实际斗争中，才能把自己锻炼得更坚强更有力量。
    怎样才能更好地发挥团的作用呢？
    （一）一切青年团的组织，都须以党和人民政府的具体中心工作，作为自己的中心工作。
    这一点，开始有些青年团的组织认识得不明确，碰了钉子。例如农村和工厂的青年团，不以加强生产作为中心工作；学校的青年团，不以加强学习作为中心工作；过多地忙于“团务”，忙于开会，唱歌游戏，搞文化娱乐工作，结果脱离了群众。黑龙江有个农村青年团的组织，在农忙的时候组织团员在家学文化，家长很生气，就把他们轰出了大门。
    以共产党和人民政府的中心工作作为自己的中心工作，不但是要在思想上如此认识，而且还要在具体工作上如此布置，即团的组织形式和工作方式，也需要服从和服务于这种中心工作的完成。有些工厂和学校的青年团组织，他们虽也抽象地承认生产和学习的重要，但并未能把这种认识贯彻到实际工作中去，仍然是会议过多，各种和中心任务无关的额外活动过于繁重，结果还是不能解决问题。真理是要通过实践来体现的，光是抽象地承认没有什么实际意义。
    另外还有一个问题必须弄清楚，就是青年团在各种实际工作当中所要发挥的作用，是属于党和人民政府的助手性质，不是也不能要求和共产党、人民政府的作用等量齐观。这就是要把青年团所能起的作用，放在一个适如其份的地位上，不估计过低，也不能估计过高。有些青年团的组织，对于团的“助手作用”这一点不了解或了解不够，把青年团不止是看作青年运动的领导核心，而且看作是整个人民革命运动的领导核心，希望团在各种工作上都要有自己单独的突出的表现，事事都想出头争先，在学校中，要想替代行政，领导学制、课程的改革：在工厂中，不配合整个职工运动和生产运动，要想由团来单独进行广泛的评选青年劳动模范运动；在农村中，甚至有个别的青年团支部，由于工作稍有成绩而自负起来，公开向党支部挑战竞赛，认为“团比党好”。这些都是不正确地夸大了团的作用。这种做法不但使团的组织容易在工作上产生先锋主义的错误，脱离群众；而且也容易由于实际上行不通而使团员灰心失望，或是使团员过度疲劳，损害身体健康。在党的直接领导之下，作为党和人民政府的忠实助手——这是团的奋斗目标，也是团的工作原则：如果离开这一原则，团就要在工作上犯错误。
    （二）团的各级组织，要注意加强团的教育工作。一是进行马列主义的思想政治教育，二是进行有关业务的文化技术教育。
    进行马列主义的思想政治教育，自然需要指导团员去阅读马列主义书籍，学习毛主席的重要著作和中国共产党的重要政策，学习关于青年团的一些基础知识；但是更为重要的，是要和实际结合；是要在工作、生产、战斗、学习等各种实际活动当中，发扬成绩，克服缺点，把事情办好，引导团员和广大青年更好的为人民服务。是要在实际斗争中培养团员的集体主义精神和自觉的劳动态度（包括自觉的工作态度、学习态度）。
    集体主义和个人主义相反，它是大公无私，在工作上实行互相配合和亲密合作的思想基础。自觉的劳动态度和雇佣态度相反，它是发挥一切工作的主动性和创造性的原动力，进行为人民服务的伟大事业，如果缺乏集体主义精神和自觉的劳动态度，那就不可能把工作做得很好，只可能把工作弄到失败。因此，我们应把培养团员的集体主义精神和自觉的劳动态度，作为团的思想政治教育的主要课题，这比单纯阅读马列主义书籍更为重要。
    培养集体主义精神，就是要培养我们在生活和工作中的整体观念，在解决一切实际问题时，能够正确地处理个人和组织、部分和全体的关系，使小道理服从大道理。在国际事务上，我们是国际主义者，坚决拥护以苏联为首的和平阵线，反对狭隘的民族主义。在中国政治上，我们是热爱人民祖国的爱国主义者，坚决拥护以工人阶级为领导的人民民主专政，反对只顾局部利益而损害统一战线的有害行动。在实际工作上，我们要做服从组织，遵守纪律的模范；个人的利益，无条件地服从组织的利益和整个人民的利益。这一切，都是整体观念的具体表现。所以国际主义的教育，爱国主义的教育，组织性纪律性的教育，都是培养集体主义精神的重要教育内容。
    建立自觉的劳动态度（包括工作态度和学习态度），就是要发扬我们在一切工作中的主动性，这是做好任何工作的不可缺少的因素。在锁链和梃杖的鞭策下，决不能有自觉的劳动态度。要启发工作上的主动性，必须工作是符合于正义的目的，使每个人都能有自觉的责任心，提高自己的主人翁感觉；这就是说，工作要有民主精神。另外，主观能动性不能建筑在单纯热情之上，而是要根据马列主义的科学指导。只有当我们充分认识了社会发展规律和中国革命发展的规律，我们才能够满怀信心地正确前进；我们做任何一件工作，也须懂得它的具体规律，看清楚它的发展前途，才能够确实和充分地掌握工作的主动性。——民主精神和科学精神，这是培养正确的劳动态度或工作态度的两个重要环节。
    进行文化技术教育，提高青年的文化水平和技术水平，这是团的教育另一个不可缺少的重要部分。农村的青年团员如果有了文化，他就能自己读书看报，吸收更多新知识，因此能把改进生产的工作和农村中的宣传教育工作做得更好。工厂或部队的青年团员如果有了文化和较好的技术，就能够成为熟练的工人或战士，在生产上在战斗中作出更多贡献。
    由于几千年封建统治的结果，中国现在的文化是落后的，全国的文盲现在还占着人口的绝大多数，全国的科学研究，还很不发达。在这种情况下，努力提倡和推广青年中的文化技术教育工作，是有着很为深远的意义。如果不消灭中国文化上的落后，我们民族智慧的提高，社会生产力的发展，就都要受到妨碍。在肃清中国文盲和提高青年文化技术水平的伟大工作上，青年团是负有严重的责任。农村和部队中的青年团员，应该配合当前的中心工作，积极展开识字运动，有步骤地努力肃清团内的文盲；工厂和机关中的青年团员，应在提高文化的基础上，学习技术，掌握专门业务；高等学校的青年团员，应努力运用马列主义的思想武器，专心钻研，深入新知识的堂殿，正像斯大林对苏联青年所指示过的：要夺取科学的堡垒。青年团的组织，应成为中国文化战线上一支重要力量。
    思想政治教育和文化技术教育，不是截然分开而是互有联系的。思想政治教育是团内教育的基础，也是保证文化技术教育健全发展的必要前提。另外，文化技术水平的提高，不但表示了实际业务能力的增长，而且也有助于较高思想政治水平的建立。“究竟应以何者作为团内教育工作的重点”？那要根据当前的工作需要而作不同的具体规定。在土地改革运动中，自然首先要强调思想政治教育，在老区经过了一定思想改造的工厂和学校中，自然就要着重文化技术教育。但不论在任何时候任何情况下，注意正确贯彻思想政治教育的原则，都是必要的。
    加强团的经常教育工作，是要培养团员的优良革命品质和提高他们的具体业务能力，使青年团成为党和人民政府更好的助手；成为党的更为优秀的后备军。
    （一）一切青年团的组织，必须巩固自己和广大群众的联系。
    青年团组织要发挥自己的重大作用，不但在于本身组织的强大，而且更在于它和广大群众的广泛密切的联系。
    为什么？
    只有和广大群众保持密切联系，青年团的工作才可能正确反映广大群众的迫切需要，与及时解决群众有关的切身问题。使团的组织因而能够取得广大群众的真心支持，能够大量吸取团外的各界青年以至某些成年参加团的工作和活动，取得他们的协助，和他们一道，把各种工作做得更好。辽东省有些团的农村支部，在春耕以前请劳动英雄讲解农作法，对于帮助团员和青年群众去参加农业生产，起了很大作用。
    只有和广大群众保持密切联系，才可能把青年团的积极影响，更广泛地传播到群众中去，青年团的工作要是有了缺点或错误，也能在广大群众的监督和帮助下，更容易发现和克服。和群众联系，是青年团能够领导群众和提高自己工作水平的必要条件。如果失去了和广大群众的应有联系，就将如鱼失水，使青年团的组织趋于枯萎，青年团的作用不能充分发挥。
    当然，作为团结广大青年的核心组织，青年团是有责任去领导青年团以外的广大青年的。但是必须了解：实现这种领导作用，决不单单依靠团的法律地位——青年团员的名义，而是要依靠团的实际工作，依靠所有青年团员在各种实际工作中的积极表现和模范作用。
    “我们是青年团员，先进分子，所以你们——一般青年群众，应该服从我们——青年团员的领导”——这种逻辑是完全错误和不能成立的。这种“妄自尊大”“自居先进”的态度，只能引起别人反感，决不是青年团员所应有的态度。只有自己以身作则，做好工作，谦虚诚恳，不摆先进架子的青年团员，才能自然地取得群众的信任，和群众打成一片，真正成为群众的优秀领导者，所以加强团和群众的联系的最根本问题，还在做好自己的工作。
    有效地配合共产党和人民政府各项中心工作的完成；经常地进行切合实际的团的教育工作；和广大青年群众保持着密切的联系——这些就是青年团能够更好地发挥作用和巩固自己组织的必要条件。
