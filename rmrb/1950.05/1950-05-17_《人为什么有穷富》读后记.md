Postscript to "Why Are People Rich and Poor?"
　　Bo Han

　　The publishing industry's widespread attention to popular reading materials is a very gratifying phenomenon. However, we all lack experience in writing popular reading materials, and we are still groping in the dark as to how to write them to suit the needs of the working class and peasants. In order to make progress, we can only criticize each other, conduct collective self-examination, and exchange experiences. Therefore, after the publication of each popular book or periodical, whether it belongs to a public or private publisher, readers should ideally offer opinions for the reference of publishers and writers. Based on this reasoning, I would like to present my opinions here regarding a book I recently read.

　　I recently read a popular reading material for workers and staff, "Why Are People Rich and Poor?", published by Tianjin Readers Bookstore. This book is divided into three parts: (1) "How Did People Come About?" explains the principle of evolution from apes to humans and that labor created the world. (2) "Why Are There Rich and Poor in Society?" explains the origin of the private property system and the social phenomena it creates. (3) "What Three Types of Exploitation Have There Been in History?" explains the evolution of several exploitative systems: slavery, feudalism, and capitalism. It can be said that this book is a simple history of social development. Trying to deal with such a broad topic in a popular booklet of just over ten thousand words is quite worthy of consideration in terms of the overall plan. I won't go into that here. In terms of the local structure, it lacks organization and fails to grasp the principle of moving from the concrete to the abstract. The sentences are inevitably Europeanized or ungrammatical, making them difficult to understand. There are also some inaccuracies or lack of rigor in the theory.

　　The opening paragraph of this book reads:

　　"All religions that serve the reactionary ruling class say that people are created by God, that God created people in his own image. This heresy has been smashed by us. We understand that it is not God who created people in his own image, but rather people who create God in their own image."

　　These abstract theoretical words are not easy to understand, but there is no concrete explanation below, and suddenly it continues with:

　　"God (i.e., spirit) is the product of the human brain, so where did people come from?"

　　This makes the reader even more confused. If God is spirit, then are people creating spirit in their own image? The question of God has not yet been clarified, and the author's pen suddenly turns to the question of where people came from. This is an example of a lack of clear organization.

　　On pages 21-22, when discussing feudal exploitation, the term "serf ownership system" is introduced at the beginning, but the meaning of this term is not immediately explained. Instead, the author first describes how this system came about. Then it says, "The society built on this exploitative method is called feudal society." In this way, readers neither understand what serf exploitation is, nor do they understand what feudal society is. Of course, the following article explains how serfs are exploited a bit, but readers of popular reading materials are impatient to accept a mystery first and then study it later. They need to understand the specific content first, and then look at the term that represents the specific content and the principle derived from it. The narrative method of this book is mostly like this example, not paying attention to the principle of going from the concrete to the abstract, so it is not popular enough.

　　Although this book is a small booklet, it contains a lot of content, so many explanations are abstract and do not provide facts to prove them. For example, on page 3, it says, "Due to the labor of hands, due to labor, mankind's domination of nature began, and they were able to constantly discover new, (punctuation in original is ".", suspected error) previously unknown substances from natural phenomena." This is entirely abstract reasoning, conceptualized phrases. Also, on page 25, it says: "In the late feudal society, commercial capital and usurious capital were very active. Under these circumstances, small-scale handicraft production could no longer keep up with the needs of the market." The so-called "these circumstances" are not introduced very clearly. It also says, "Capitalist exploitation is the most cruel," but it doesn't provide any evidence. Many of the terms used are not explained. Things like "organic body," "humanized chemical conditions," "the reflection of things in the human brain's imagination," "due to the limitations of production conditions," "according to the production level at the time," are written at will.

　　Most of the sentences are Europeanized. For example, on page 16, it says, "Rich and poor are not born, ... it is only produced when the social productive forces develop to the point where a worker's labor produces more products than his own minimum needs." A very long sentence is inserted in "... when," which people with low cultural level cannot understand. Some sentences have grammatical problems. For example, on page 19, it says, "Slaves are no longer simple assistants, but are driven to the fields or workshops in dozens and dozens to work, carrying out large-scale slave production." The subject of the next clause suddenly changes to slave owners, and it is not specified, which makes people feel confused. On page 9, "The emergence of private ownership has its material basis. If this material basis is lacking, private ownership will not arise. This material basis is when the results of human labor, in addition to being able to support himself, also have some surplus things, private ownership is produced on this basis." The first two sentences are a repetition of the same meaning, regardless of that. In the latter sentence, grammatically, "this material basis" is "human ... when," how can the material basis be "when"? Also, "himself" should be "themselves."

　　Furthermore, regarding the theoretical aspects. On page 2, the explanation of the division of labor between the hands and feet of anthropoid apes uses the example of climbing up and down trees, without mentioning the fact that during the Ice Age, these anthropoid apes were forced to leave the forests and had to labor to produce in order to fight against the environment. This fails to explain why today's apes cannot evolve into humans. On page 5, the title is "If you can eat meat, you can use fire." This causal relationship seems too bizarre. On page 6, it says, "The so-called Youchao Clan teaching people to build houses, and Leizu teaching people to make clothes, are all fabrications of the ruling class later." On page 5, it says, "The legend of Shennong tasting hundreds of herbs is completely unfounded." "The legend of Suiren drilling wood to make fire is entirely an embellishment by the ruling class later." This view of legends violates the viewpoint of historical materialism, because legends have their social roots and are not entirely fabricated by the ruling class later. The ruling class later simply treated Youchao, Suiren, and Shennong as emperors. On page 10, it says, "Humans are reproduced by chaotic sexual intercourse, migrating frequently, without a fixed residence. At this stage, it is obvious that private ownership cannot arise." Attributing the reason why private ownership cannot arise to chaotic sexual intercourse contradicts the reason mentioned on page 12 that "the production tools at that time were very backward, the productivity was very low, ... there was no surplus, ... and private ownership could not arise." On page 21, it says: "At this time, the old and new land owners believed that according to the production level at the time, changing the mode of exploitation would not only be harmless to them but also beneficial. On this basis, the serf ownership mode of exploitation arose in response to the times." Here, the transformation from slave ownership to serf ownership is described as if it was consciously carried out by slave owners and emerging landlords, which violates historical science. And in the end, when talking about why the proletariat wants to revolt, it only generally says "Without completely eliminating capitalism, the proletariat cannot be liberated," "Now the proletariat of the whole world is fighting to eliminate this mode of exploitation," without starting from the actual situation in China to explain that the current task of the Chinese working class is to unite the peasants, the petty bourgeoisie, and the bourgeoisie to establish a new democratic China, and that the future task is to completely eliminate capitalist exploitation and establish socialism. To preach empty principles to workers and staff members while divorced from certain historical conditions and current tasks not only fails to achieve good results, but also often leads to unrealistic and erroneous understandings.

　　The above are the imperfections I see in this book. But it doesn't mean that only this book has these problems. In reality, we all make these mistakes to varying degrees when writing popular reading materials, especially the abstractness of the narration, the lack of clarity, and the Europeanization of sentences. In order to seek progress together, mutual self-examination is necessary.

　　《人为什么有穷富》读后记
　　伯韩
    现在出版界普遍注意到通俗读物的出版，这是非常可喜的现象。可是通俗读物的编写，我们大家都没有什么经验，应该怎样编写才适合工农大众的需要，都还在暗中摸索。为了求得进步，只有相互批评，集体检讨，交流经验。因此每一种通俗书刊出版以后，不论它是属于公营或私营出版家的，读者最好能提出意见来，供出版者及编写者的参考。我根据这一点理由，想把我对于最近读过的一本书的意见在这里提出。
    我最近读过一本职工通俗读物《人为什么有穷富》，是天津读者书店出版的。这本书分三部分：（一）《人是怎么来的？》说明从猿到人及劳动创造世界的道理。（二）《社会上为什么有穷富？》说明私有财产制的来源和它所造成的社会现象。（三）《历史上有那三种剥削方式？》说明奴隶制，封建制及资本主义制的几种剥削的演进情形。可以说这本书就是一本简单的社会发展史。一万多字的一本通俗小册子中，想处理这样广泛的题目，在整个计划上，就颇值得斟酌。这一点这儿且不去说它。在局部的结构上，更是欠条理，不能把握由具体到抽象的原则。语句不免欧化，或者不合文法，读起来是不容易懂的。理论上也有欠严密或不准确的地方。
    这书开首的第一段这样写着：
    为反动统治阶级服务的各种教门都说人是神造的，是神照着神的样子来造人，这种邪说已被咱们捣破了，咱们明白了不是神照着神的样子来造人，倒是人照着人的样子来造神。
    这些抽象理论的文字是不容易了解的，可是下面并没有具体的说明，而突然接着：
    神（即精神）是人脑的产物，那末人到底是从那里来的呢？
    这可就使读者越看越胡涂了。神即精神，那末人是不是照着人的样子来造精神呢？神的问题还没有闹清，作者的笔锋突然又转到人从那里来的的问题了。这是条理不够清楚的一个例子。
    第二十一至二十二页上，讲封建剥削，一开始就提出了农奴占有制的名词，但不马上给说明这名词的意义，而先说这制度怎样产生出来的道理。接下来又说，“以这个剥削方式为基础建立起来的社会，就叫封建社会。”这样，读者既不明白什么是农奴剥削制，也就不明白什么是封建社会了。固然在下面的文章把农奴是怎样被剥削的情形说了一点，可是通俗读物的读者是不耐烦先接受个闷葫芦然后研究下去的，他们需要先了解具体的内容，然后看那个代表具体内容的名词和从那儿引出来的道理。这本书的叙述方法大半都像这个例子一样，没有注意到从具体到抽象的原则，所以不够通俗。
    这书虽然是个小册，但包含的内容很多，因此许多说明都是抽象的，根本没有举出事实来证明。例如页三上说，“由于手的劳动，由于劳动，人类对于自然的统治便开始了，他们就能不断的从自然现象中发现新的，（标点原文作“。”，疑有误）过去所不知道的物质。”完全是抽象的道理，概念化的辞句。又如二十五页上说：“在封建社会的末期，商业资本和高利贷资本是很活跃的，在这种情况下，小规模的手工业生产，已经赶不上市场的需要了。”所谓“这种情况”，并没有很明白的介绍出来。又说“资本主义的剥削是最残酷的”，也没有举出任何证据。所用的术语很不少，多半是没有解释的。什么“有机体”“人类化的化学条件”“事物在人类脑中幻想的反映”“由于生产条件的限制”“按照当时的生产水平”之类，摇笔即来。
    语句多半是欧化的，例如十六页上说，“穷富不是天生的，……它是在社会生产力发展到一个劳动者的劳动所出的生产品，多于他本人最低限度的需要时，才产生出来的。”“在……时”中夹了很长的句子，文化水准不高的人看不懂。有些句子文法上有问题。例如十九页上说，“奴隶已经不是简单的助手，而是把他们几十几十的赶到田地里或手工场里去作工，进行大规模的奴隶生产。”下一分句的主语忽然换了奴隶主，又没有写明，使人看了有糊涂之感。第九页上“私有制的产生，是有它的物质基础的，如果缺乏这种物质基础，私有制是不会产生的。这种物质基础，就是人类劳动结果，除了能够养活他自己以外，还有一些剩余的东西时，私有制就在这个基础上产生了。”前面两句是同一意思的反复，且不管它。后面这句，照文法看，“这种物质基础”就是“人类……时”，怎么物质基础会是“时”呢？又“他自己”应作“他们自己”。
    再说理论方面。第二页上以树上的生活爬上爬下来说明类人猿的手脚分工，而没有说到冰河期这些类人猿被迫离开树林，不得不劳动生产来和环境斗争的事实。这就不能解释今天的猿类不能进化为人类的道理了。第五页上标题“会吃肉，就会用火。”这个因果关系似乎太离奇了。第六页上说，“所谓有巢氏教人盖房，嫘祖教人做衣服，统统是后来统治阶级的捏造。”第五页上说，“神农氏尝百草的传说，完全是没有根据的。”“燧人氏钻木取火的传说，完全是后来统治阶级的附会。”这样对传说的看法，是违反历史唯物论的观点的，因为传说有它的社会根源，并非完全由后来统治阶级所捏造，后来统治阶级不过把有巢氏、燧人氏、神农氏当作帝王来讲罢了。第十页上说，“人类是用杂乱的性交繁殖着，经常迁移，没有固定住所，在这个阶段上，不可能产生私有制，那是很明显的。”这样把不可能产生私有制的原因归到杂乱的性交上面，和第十二页上所说的“当时的生产工具很落后，生产力很低，……并没有什么剩余，……而不可能产生私有制”的道理不相符合。第二十一页上说：“在这个时候，旧有的与新兴的土地占有者，认为按照当时的生产水平，改变一下剥削方式，对于他们不仅无害而且有利，就在这个基础上，农奴占有制的剥削方式，遂应时而生了。”这儿把奴隶占有制向农奴占有制的转变，说成仿佛是奴隶主与新兴地主自觉的进行的，那就违反了历史科学。而在最后讲到无产阶级为什么要革命时，只是一般的讲了“不彻底消灭资本主义，无产阶级就不能获得解放”，“现在全世界的无产阶级，都正为消灭这种剥削方式而斗争着”，并没有从中国的实际情况出发，说明中国工人阶级当前的任务是团结农民、小资产阶级及资产阶级建立新民主主义的新中国，将来的任务才是彻底消灭资本剥削、建立社会主义。脱离了一定的历史条件与当前任务来向职工们讲空泛的道理，不只收不到良好的效果，而且往往引导出不合实际的、错误的认识。
    以上是我认为这书不完善的地方。但并不是说只有这本书有这些毛病。实在我们大家写通俗读物，都或多或少地犯了这些毛病，特别是叙述的抽象，不明白，语句的欧化这几点。为了共求进步，相互的检讨是必要的。
