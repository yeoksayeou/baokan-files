Editor's Note

　　This journal has been launched for just over a month, and we have already received many manuscripts and letters from readers across the country. We would first like to express our heartfelt gratitude.

　　In the readers' letters, some have encouraged our work, and others have offered various suggestions. Many readers have expressed the hope that this journal will add a "New Book Review" column to review and introduce new publications as they come out. This is a good idea, but due to limited manpower, this journal cannot do it well in the short term. We ask readers to help us do it. The work of book reviews requires the joint participation of a broad readership and authors.

　　The manuscripts published in the previous issues of this journal are partly from readers and partly commissioned. Because this journal has too little space, it is difficult to publish all the manuscripts submitted by readers. Therefore, we would like to ask contributors to pay attention to the following points:

　　1. For longer manuscripts, we hope to choose books and periodicals that are more representative and have a greater impact on readers as the object of review and introduction. At the same time, in order to take care of all aspects, criticisms of the same type of books and periodicals should not be published too much. After the first issue of this journal published "Review of Junior Chinese Language Textbook, Volume 4", we continuously received six articles on the junior and senior high school Chinese textbooks of Xinhua Bookstore. We can only forward these articles to the editorial department of Xinhua Bookstore for reference and cannot publish them one by one.

　　2. For some book and periodical reviews with relatively simple content, it is not necessary to write long articles, just two or three hundred words to about a thousand words is enough.

　　3. The review work of various specialized works should be done by specialized scholars. We hope that academic workers in various departments will give us more help. We hope that translators will participate in the review of translated books and periodicals.

　　4. One of the central purposes of book review work is to improve the quality of publications. Therefore, we hope that everyone will write with an attitude of "curing the disease to save the patient" and put forward specific methods for modification as much as possible. When writing, we hope to focus on the original book, identify the key points, be specific and concise, and reduce unnecessary words as much as possible.

　　编者的话
    本刊创刊还不过一个月，已经收到各地读者许多文稿和书信，我们首先要表示衷心的感谢。
    读者来书中，有的对我们的工作加以鼓励，有的提出种种建议。有好多位读者，希望本刊增辟“新书评介”栏，随时把新出书刊加以评论介绍。这意思很好，只是本刊限于人力，在短时间内，还不能很好地做到。我们要求读者帮助我们来做。要做书评的工作，非有广大的读者和著作者共同来参加不可。
    本刊已出版各期的文稿，一部分是读者寄来的，一部分是特约稿。由于本刊篇幅太少，读者来稿势难完全刊出。因此，我们要请投稿者注意下列各点：
    一、凡是篇幅较长的文稿，希望选择较有代表性的、对读者影响较大的书刊来做评介的对象。同时，为着照顾到各个方面，批评同一类书刊的文字，不能发表得太多。本志创刊号登出了《评初中国文第四册》之后，连续收到了六篇关于新华书店初高中国文的文字，我们只能把这些文字转寄给新华书店编辑部参考，无法一一刊载出来。
    二、某些书刊评介，内容比较简单，就不必写成长文，只要二三百字至一千字左右就好了。
    三、各种专门著作的评介工作，该由专门学者来做，希望各部门学术工作者多多给我们助力。翻译书刊的评介，希望翻译工作者来参加。
    四、书评工作的中心目的之一是提高出版物的质量，因此希望大家用“治病救人”的态度来写，尽可能提出修改的具体办法。写的时候，希望能够针对原书，认定重点，具体、扼要、不必要的词句尽可能减少。
