　　Lin County Xiaodian Village Branch Improves Party Organization While Leading Production

Editor's Note: The experience of Xiaodian Village in consolidating and strengthening the branch while leading production proves that only in the movement can the organization be expanded and consolidated, the ties with the masses be strengthened, and effective education and correct identification of Party members be carried out. The experience of Xiaodian Village is published for reference by rural branches in various regions.

The Xiaodian Village Branch in Lin County, Pingyuan Province, has 26 Party members. The branch secretary is active in his work, but he has the work style of resorting to coercion and commandism, and being divorced from the masses. There is also disunity with Han Xingzi, the director of the armed forces committee. Three young people in the village, fearing conscription, went outside to study. Their families had been criticized by the branch secretary for their superstitious beliefs, and therefore harbored resentment against the branch secretary. After the promulgation of the Land Law in 1947, they returned to the village and, using the director of the armed forces committee, instigated the military dependents to organize a poor peasant association to struggle against the branch secretary. At this time, several active Party members, such as Song Zhangzi (village chief), Lü Baozi (deputy branch secretary), and Han Chouzi (deputy village chief), also became dispirited and stopped working. The branch had not held a meeting for half a year. At the end of the land reform and Party rectification, right and wrong were distinguished, problems were solved, and the leadership also made self-criticisms, and everyone's morale improved slightly. However, due to the branch being divorced from the masses and a section of the masses being controlled by bad elements, last February, when the government distributed military shoes, all the military dependents resisted and refused to make them under the instigation of bad elements, and cursed the district and village cadres. After the problem was resolved, the branch used this to educate Party members, making everyone realize that if the branch Party members are not united and do not serve the masses, not only will the masses not support them, but it will also allow bad elements to take the opportunity to make trouble. However, no more than a dozen Party members expressed their determination to continue working.

Last June, the county Party committee put forward the task of drought resistance, planting and seizing the time to plant. The district Party committee went to Xiaodian Village to help the branch make a plan. As soon as the plan was made, it started to rain. Before the rain stopped, Han Chouzi, Lü Baozi, and others carried hoes to the fields to check. At that time, there had been three fingers of rain, and they thought that if they could seize the time to plant, they could still get a crop. They immediately called a branch meeting and decided to mobilize the masses to rush to plant. However, after the Party members carried out propaganda, the masses were still hesitant. The branch convened a meeting of Party members to study, and decided to go deep into the masses to mobilize them. Twenty Party members were divided into seven groups by lane to carry out propaganda activities among the masses, and first worked to get their own family members to agree. At the same time, Party members and Party members, and Party members and the masses, met on the spot to help each other, and solve the difficulties of labor and animal power. Most of the masses in the village were persuaded, but a few masses still said, "Let's see how it goes!" Han Chouzi and others then decided to lead the masses through action. The next day, at dawn, Han Chouzi shouted on the broadcasting station: "It's dawn, get up and sow the land!" The Party member cadres got up, carried the drills, took the yokes, and walked to the fields with clanging sounds. Mutual aid groups also knocked on each other's doors to call out. Han Chouzi again asked loudly on the broadcasting station: "Where are you going to plant?" People below answered: "To the east field!" "To the west field!" This brought up some more people. For example, women Party members took the lead in pulling the drill and carrying manure, influencing Han Xiuufu's wife (a military dependent, who had not been to the fields since her husband joined the army) to spread fertilizer on five mu of land early in the morning. The cadres immediately broadcast praise. After being praised, she became even more active, and when the substitute tillers went to sow the land for her, she said: "You just take care of sowing, I'll pull the roller." Of the 180 female laborers in the village, more than 140 participated in the rush to plant. The village originally planned to finish planting in two days, but due to the mobilization of women's labor and the extensive exchange of labor and animal power, the 1,412 mu of wheat stubble land was planted in one and a half days. It rained continuously for two days after planting, and the seedlings came out on the third day. The masses were very happy. The branch made a timely summary, selected ten model Party members, and criticized Han Xingzi, Guo Hu (director of the farmers' association), and Han Fulin, a few Party members who neither implemented the resolutions nor carried out propaganda to mobilize the masses. Then, a mass meeting was held to summarize. At the meeting, the masses unanimously praised the Party member cadres for seizing the opportunity to lead the rush to plant. The military dependents, who were dissatisfied with the cadres in the past, were very happy this time because the cadres led the masses to plant for the military dependents first. Finally, 20 models were selected (including 10 Party members). Righteousness was established within the Party, and the relationship between the branch and the masses was initially close.

After the seedlings came out, mole crickets appeared in the fields. At the meal field, Zhu Xiugui said to Han Chouzi: "The seedlings have come out, but the mole crickets are very harmful (because red alum was not used during rush planting). What can we do to get rid of them?" Han Chouzi, hearing this feedback, considered that this was an urgent demand of the masses in the village, and immediately looked for Lü Baozi and Song Zhangzi to discuss catching insects. However, everyone had no practical experience, and it was decided that Party members should first experiment to find a method, and then mobilize the masses to catch them. The first night, they used two red lanterns to the fields for two hours, but did not catch a single one. Everyone thought that the light was probably too small. The second night, they carried several baskets of wheat straw and baked for two or three hours, but only one flew in. Everyone said that it was fortunate that it was an experiment, otherwise the masses would definitely be dissatisfied. But everyone was still not discouraged. Someone heard that mole crickets liked to burrow under dung piles, so on the third night, they divided into two shifts for experimentation. Han Chouzi's shift used manure, dividing a load into six piles on the ground, and Song Zhangzi's shift used pen manure. When they went to see early the next morning, there were five or six under each pile. Everyone was happy, and put them in gourds and took them to the meal field to show the masses. The masses immediately clamored: "Wow! So many, how did you catch them?" The Party members immediately introduced the process and method of catching insects, and also introduced the experience on the broadcasting station, calling for catching insects. The branch immediately convened a meeting, made a plan for catching insects, and announced it to the masses, who all agreed. The next day, more than 700 were caught in the early morning. At the ten-day summary, more than 7,000 were caught. Summaries, inspections, and selection of models were conducted separately in the branch and among the masses. The cadres took part of the money from the public welfare fund of the cooperative and bought several baskets and two scythes for awards. Everyone happily said: "The cadres really put in a lot of effort to catch insects for us, otherwise we would not have been able to think of this method." In the second ten-day plan, more than 7,000 were caught, for a total of more than 14,000 in two times. At the final summary, the cadres took more than 14,000 mole crickets to the venue for exhibition. The masses said: "Each mole cricket can eat at least one liter of grain by autumn, which will eat a total of more than 140 stones!" This is equivalent to increasing production by more than 140 stones of grain, and everyone was very happy.

After drought resistance, rush planting, and insect catching, the vast majority of Party members became active, and 19 of them were selected as models by the masses. Everyone also realized that leading production and their own production are not contradictory. They led the masses to rush to plant by rushing to plant themselves, and led the masses to catch insects by catching insects themselves, which not only improved their own production, but also gained the support of the masses. At this time, Han Xingzi saw that the vast majority of Party members were united around Han Chouzi and other cadre Party members, and gained the support of the masses, and then thoroughly reviewed himself, and declared that he would unite with everyone in the future, actively lead production, and strive to be a model. The old branch secretary also realized that his work style was not good, and expressed that he would resolutely change his work style. He also became a model during this period due to his active work, and solved the remaining historical problems in actively leading production.

Autumn harvest came, and the branch made a four-day plan for sending fertilizer and cutting mung beans. Party members mobilized men and women in the masses for labor competition. The men said: "We will send all the fertilizer to the fields in four days. What will you women do?" The women said: "We will cut all the mung beans in the village in four days." More than 120 female laborers, except for the sick, all participated in cutting beans. All 20 carts and 44 livestock in the village automatically exchanged labor and helped each other, carrying, pushing, and carrying manure to the fields, and bringing back mung beans on the way. The men did not rest at noon, and helped the women to dry beans and thresh. The four-day plan was completed in three days.

The superiors called for warm water soaking of seeds. Some Party members were not convinced, and the masses were not used to it. Han Chouzi used three flowerpots to experiment with soaked seeds, unsoaked seeds, and oil-coated seeds. As a result, the soaked seeds came out one day earlier, and came out neatly and well. The unsoaked seeds came out one day later and were uneven and poor. The oil-coated seeds came out even later. At the branch meeting, he brought the three pots of seedlings to the meeting, convincing all Party members, and decided to mobilize the whole village to implement seed soaking. After the meeting, youth league, women's federation, and mutual aid team leaders meetings were held separately to explain the benefits and methods of seed soaking. Young people and women challenged each other in competition, guaranteeing to mobilize their families to implement seed soaking. Mutual aid teams also competed with each other. As a result, all 1,212 mu of land in the village were soaked, except for two households who did not soak due to being away (totaling 17 mu of land). At the three-autumn summary, a total of 38 models were selected, 24 of whom were Party members. On this basis, the branch committee was re-elected. Han Chouzi was elected branch secretary, Lü Baozi continued to serve as deputy branch secretary, and other active Party members in the movement were also elected to leadership positions, improving the organization and leadership of the branch committee.

### 林县小店村支部在领导生产中健全党组织

　　林县小店村支部在领导生产中健全党组织
    编者按：小店村在领导生产中整理与健全支部的经验，证明只有在运动中才能扩大并巩固组织以及密切与群众的联系，也才能对党员进行有效的教育和正确的鉴定。现将小店村的经验发表以供各地农村支部参考。
    平原省林县小店村支部有党员二六个，支书工作积极，但存在着强迫命令、脱离群众的作风。并与武委主任韩兴子闹不团结。村中有三个青年怕参军躲到外面上学，家中因迷信被支书整过，因而对支书怀恨不满。一九四七年土地法颁发后，他们回村利用武委会主任，煽动军属组织贫农团斗争了支书。这时宋章子（村长）、逯保子（副支书）、韩丑子（副村长）等几个积极党员，也都消沉不干了。支部半年没开过会。结束土地改革与整党时，分清是非，解决问题，领导上也作了检讨，大家情绪才稍稍提高。但由于支部脱离群众，一部群众又被坏分子掌握，去年二月政府派下军鞋，军属在坏分子挑动下全体抵抗不做，并大骂区村干部。问题解决后，支部以此教育党员，使大家认识了：假如支部党员不团结，不为群众服务，不但群众不拥护，而且会使坏分子乘机捣乱。但党员中表示坚决干的也不过十来个人。
    去年六月县委提出抗旱点种与抢种任务。区分委到小店村帮助支部作计划。刚订完计划就下起雨来，雨还未停，韩丑子、逯保子等便背了锄头到地里检查。当时已有三指雨，他们想假如能抓紧时间抢种还能出来。回去即召集支部开会，决定动员群众抢种。但党员进行宣传后，群众仍犹豫不定。支部召集党员开会研究后，决定深入群众动员。二十个党员以闾分为七伙在群众中进行宣传活动，并先打通自己家里人的思想。同时党员与党员，党员与群众当场碰组互助，解决劳畜力困难。全村群众大部思想通了，但少数群众仍说“看情况吧！”韩丑子他们便决定再从行动中带动群众。次日天明，韩丑子就到广播台上喊叫：“天明了快起来耩地吧！”党员干部起来背上耧、拿上套，叮叮当当往地里走。互助组也互相打门叫喊。韩丑子又在广播台上大声问：“到那里种呀？”下边人回答着：“到东地！”“到西地！”这样又带起来了一些人。如妇女党员带头拉耧抬大粪，影响韩修福老婆一清早也拉了五亩地肥（军属，男人参军后没去过地）。干部马上广播表扬。被表扬后她更加积极，当代耕人去给她耩地时她说：“你们光管耩，我给拉砘。”全村一百八十个女劳动力，参加抢种的即有一百四十多个。全村原计划两天种完，但由于发动妇女劳动与广泛的劳畜力变工互助，一天半就把一千四百一十二亩麦茬地种上了。种后连阴两天，第三天苗都出来了。群众非常高兴。支部及时作出总结，评选了十个模范党员，同时批评了韩兴子、郭虎（农会主任）、韩福林几个既不执行决议，又不宣传动员群众的党员。接着又召开群众会议总结，会上群众一致赞扬党员干部抓紧时机领导抢种。军属过去对干部不满，这次干部领导群众先给军属种上了，都非常高兴。最后评选模范二十名（其中党员十名），党内树立了正气，支部与群众关系也初步密切了。
    苗出来后，地里又出了蝼蛄。在饭场上朱秀贵向韩丑子说：“苗倒出来了，就是蝼蛄虫可厉害哩（因抢种没使红矾），这用什么办法能除了呢？”韩丑子听到这个反映，考虑到这是全村群众的迫切要求，即找逯保子、宋章子商量捉虫。但大家都没实际经验，决议党员先试验出办法，然后再动员群众去捉。第一夜他们几个人用两个红灯到地里等了两个钟头也没捉住一个，大家认为大概是灯光太小，第二夜背了几筐子麦秸，烘了两三个钟头只飞来一个。大家说，幸亏是试验，不然群众一定不满。但大家仍不灰心。有人听说蝼蛄虫好往粪堆底下钻，于是第三晚上分成两班试验，韩丑子一班用大粪，一担子分成六堆倒在地里，宋章子一班用圈粪。次日一早去看，每堆底下有五六个。大家高兴了，把它装到葫芦里，拿到饭场上让群众看。群众立刻吵嚷着：“呀！这么多，怎么捉的？”党员即介绍捉虫经过与办法，又到广播台上介绍经验，号召捉虫。支部马上召集会议，作了捉虫计划，给群众宣布后大家都同意。第二天一早就捉了七百多个，十天总结时捉七千多个。在支部和群众中分别总结检查评选模范，干部从合作社公益款中取出一部分钱，买了几个篮子两张镰发奖。大家高兴的说：干部为咱捉虫可真下了工夫，不然咱可想不出这个办法来。第二个十天计划中又捉了七千多，两次共捉一万四千多。最后总结时干部把一万四千多蝼蛄虫拿到会场上展览。群众说：“每一个蝼蛄吃到秋天最少也能吃一升粮食，总共就要吃一百四十多石！”这样等于增产一百四十多石粮食，大家非常高兴。
    经过抗旱抢种与捉虫，绝大多数党员积极了，被群众选为模范的就有十九个。大家也体会到领导生产与自己生产并不矛盾。自己抢种领导了群众抢种，自己捉虫领导了群众捉虫，既搞好了自己的生产，又得到了群众拥护。此时韩兴子看到绝大多数党员都团结在韩丑子等几个干部党员周围，并得到了群众拥护，才彻底检讨了自己，并声明以后要和大家团结，积极领导生产争取模范。旧支书也认识到自己作风不好，表示要坚决改变作风。他在这个时期由于工作积极也当了模范，在积极领导生产中把遗留下来的历史问题也解决了。
    秋收到来了，支部订了四天送肥割绿豆计划。党员在群众中动员男女分工竞赛，男人说：“俺四天把所有的肥全部送到地里，你们妇女干啥？”妇女们说：“俺四天把全村绿豆割完。”一百二十多个妇女劳力除病号外，全部参加割豆。全村二十辆小车、四十四个牲口，自动变工互助，担的推的背的往地送粪，回来捎绿豆，男人们晌午不歇晌，帮妇女晒豆打场，四天的计划三天便完成了。
    上级号召温汤浸种。党员有的思想不通，群众也无此习惯。韩丑子即用三个花盆，把浸种的，不浸种的，油搓的都作了试验。结果浸种的先出来一天，出的又齐又肥。不浸种的晚出一天而且不齐不肥。油搓的出得更晚。开支部会时他把三盆苗端到会上，打通了全体党员的思想，决定动员全村实行浸种。会后分别召开青年团、妇联会、互助组长等会议，说明浸种好处与办法。青年与妇女挑战竞赛，保证动员自己家里实行浸种，互助组内也互相竞赛，结果全村一千二百十二亩地全浸了种，只有两户因外出未浸种（共地十七亩）。三秋总结时，共选出三十八个模范，其中二十四个是党员。在此基础上改选了支部委员会，韩丑子当选支部书记，逯保子仍任副支书，其他运动中的积极党员也都选到领导岗位上，健全了支委会的组织与领导。
