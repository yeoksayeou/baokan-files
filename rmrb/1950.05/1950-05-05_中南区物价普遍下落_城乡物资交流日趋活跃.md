Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 29th. Since March, prices in the Central South region have generally declined steadily. This is the result of the implementation of the Government Administration Council's decision on unified national financial and economic work, with fiscal revenue and expenditure nearing balance and currency values stabilizing. As of April 14th, the average market price of five major daily necessities – rice, salt, cotton, cloth, and yarn – had fallen by 34.75% compared to March 1st, and the market is showing a new outlook.

Comparing the prices of the five major cities in the Central South region on April 14th with those on March 1st, Guangzhou saw the largest drop, at 41.2%; followed by Wuhan, down 38.19%; Nanchang, down 36.95%; Zhengzhou, down 29.82%; and Changsha, down 27.6%.

During the same period, among the above-mentioned five major daily necessities, table salt fell by 45.62%, cotton by 41.43%, cotton yarn by 33.28%, cloth by 33.22%, and rice by 26.29%.

Due to price stability, the broad masses of people who have suffered from inflation for many years have gradually changed their past mentality of "valuing goods over currency." The phenomena of material freezing and supply-demand imbalances caused by inflation have also greatly changed, and the market is extremely well-stocked. At the same time, market transactions have not shrunk and become sluggish due to falling prices. Taking the recent week of April 17th to 22nd as an example, except for slight reductions in the trading volume of rice and coal, the trading volume of table salt increased by 116.6% compared to the previous week, the trading volume of cotton increased by 61.12% compared to the previous week, and the trading volume of cotton yarn increased by 66%. Taking Wuhan as an example, the exchange of goods between urban and suburban rural areas and small and medium-sized cities is also more active than in the past, and the RMB has begun to flow into rural areas in large quantities. The phenomenon of "money not staying overnight and not going to the countryside" in the past has now changed significantly.

　　中南区物价普遍下落
    城乡物资交流日趋活跃
    【新华社汉口二十九日电】中南区物价自三月以来普遍稳步回落。这是执行政务院关于统一国家财政经济工作的决定，财政收支已接近平衡，币值已趋稳定的结果。截至四月十四日止，米、盐、棉、布、纱五种主要日用品市价平均较三月一日下跌百分之三十四点七五，市场已呈现出一片新气象。
    中南区五大都市物价以四月十四日与三月一日比较，以广州下跌最多，计跌百分之四十一点二；其次是武汉，跌百分之三十八点一九，南昌跌百分之三十六点九五，郑州跌百分之二十九点八二，长沙跌百分之二十七点六。
    同期上述五种主要日用品中，计食盐下跌百分之四十五点六二，棉花跌百分之四十一点四三，棉纱跌百分之三十三点二八，布跌百分之三十三点二二，食米跌百分之二十六点二九。
    由于物价稳定，多少年来饱受通货膨胀痛苦的广大人民已逐渐改变了过去“重货轻币”的心理；因通货膨胀所造成的物资冻结、供求失调的现象亦已大为改观，市场物资极为充沛。同时，市场交易并未因物价下跌而趋于萎缩不振，以最近四月十七至二十二日的一周为例，除米、煤等交易量略形减少以外，食盐成交量较上周增加百分之一一六点六，棉花成交量较上周增加百分之六十一点一二，棉纱成交量增加百分之六十六。以武汉市为例，城市与郊区农村及中小城市的物资交流，亦较过去活跃，人民币开始大量流向农村。过去“钞票一不过夜，二不下乡”的现象现已显著改变。
