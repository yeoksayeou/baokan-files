Muslim Affairs Handled by the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau
　　Muslim Affairs Work Committee Ordered to Conclude
    [Beijing Municipal News Agency] The Beijing Municipal People's Government's Muslim Affairs Work Committee has been ordered to conclude its work due to the completion of its tasks. From now on, matters related to Muslim affairs will be handled by the Ethnic Affairs Section of the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau. The Muslim Affairs Work Committee convened a forum on the 18th with more than 260 representatives from all sectors of the Muslim community in the city. Director Ma Yuhuai of the Work Committee reported on the work done in the past year (see separate article). Secretary-General Xue Zizheng of the Municipal People's Government also attended and spoke on behalf of the Mayor.
    At the forum, Director Ma Yuhuai, after reporting on the establishment of the Muslim Affairs Work Committee and the work done in the past year, emphasized two points regarding the existing problems that he hoped the Muslim community would pay attention to and work together to resolve in the future: (1) In handling ethnic disputes, the spirit of unity of being lenient with others and strict with oneself should be adopted to seek reasonable solutions. In terms of lifestyle habits, one should not only demand that others respect and take care of oneself, but also respect and take care of others. (2) The temporary difficulties currently encountered in certain industries and in the lives of some Muslims should be recognized as being caused by fundamental changes in China's political and economic landscape. The decline of certain industries not needed by the broad masses of the people is inevitable. At the same time, Taiwan has not yet been liberated, and a huge military expenditure is still required, so the government cannot allocate more funds to open factories to solve the current unemployment problem. In addition, some capitalists among the Muslims are not making efforts to maintain businesses that can still be sustained and are adopting a passive attitude. Those who need to change careers are also avoiding transferring funds, which also increases Muslim unemployment and adds to the government's difficulties. Secretary-General Xue Zizheng pointed out in his speech that after the Muslim Affairs Work Committee concludes its work, matters related to Muslims will be handled by the Ethnic Affairs Section of the Civil Affairs Bureau. This direct handling by the state power organs will enable more direct solutions to problems. At the same time, the government will continue to train and promote Muslim cadres and assign them to work in various districts and public security sub-bureaus to better connect with the Muslim masses. Regarding the temporary economic and living difficulties currently existing, Secretary-General Xue pointed out that this is not just a difficulty for Muslims. The government is fully confident in overcoming it, and hopes that everyone will work together.

　　回民事务归市民政局办理
    回民工作委员会奉令结束
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民政府回民工作委员会因工作任务完成，现已奉命结束，今后有关回民事务，归由市民政局民族事务科办理。回民工作委员会曾于十八日召集本市各界回民代表二百六十余人举行座谈会，由回委会主任马玉槐报告一年来工作概况（见另条），市人民政府薛子正秘书长亦代表市长出席讲话。
    座谈会上，马玉槐主任于报告回民工作委员会的成立经过及一年来所作的工作后，对目前存在的问题，希望回胞今后注意协力解决的，他着重指出两点：（一）在处理民族纠纷上，应本待人宽责己严的团结精神求得合理解决，在生活习惯上，不只要求别人尊重照顾自己，同时自己也要照顾尊重别人。（二）目前在某些行业及一部回民生活中所发生的暂时困难，应认识到这是由中国政治经济发生根本变化所引起，某些不属广大人民需要的行业是必然萧条的；同时，目前台湾尚未解放，还需要庞大的军费开支，所以政府不可能拿出更大资金来开办工厂以解决目前失业问题；另外，回民中的某些资本家，对尚能维持的商业不努力维持，抱消极态度，须要转业的也不转业而逃避资金，也是增多回民失业的原因，给政府增添了困难。薛子正秘书长讲话时指出：回民工作委员会结束后，有关回民的事务由民政局民族事务科处理，这样，由政权机关直接处理，将更能直接解决问题；同时政府将继续培养提拔回民干部，分配到各区、各公安分局工作，以便更好地联系回民群众。关于目前经济与生活上存在的暂时困难，薛秘书长指出：这不仅是回民的困难；政府完全有把握克服，希望大家共同努力。
