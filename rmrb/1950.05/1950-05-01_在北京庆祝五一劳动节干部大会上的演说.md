Comrades!

We are very excited to celebrate the first May Day Labor Day after the founding of the People's Republic of China. Because in the past, except for the liberated areas, most of the working people in China, when celebrating their own holiday - May Day Labor Day, not only could not be protected by the government, on the contrary, they were also subject to the strict prohibition of the reactionary government. The working people could only hold celebrations and spend their holidays under the close surveillance of the reactionary army and secret police, and under the conditions of fighting them regardless of sacrifice. However, the situation is completely different for the Chinese working people celebrating this year's May Day Labor Day. May Day Labor Day has been designated by the Central People's Government as one of the most important legal holidays in the country, and factories, workshops, organs, schools, and units of the People's Liberation Army are ordered to take a holiday on this day. The people's army and police will not only not prohibit the people from holding celebrations and parades, on the contrary, they will participate in the celebrations and parades with the people. It is the responsibility of the People's Government to protect the working people to celebrate their own May Day Labor Day in a peaceful and joyful situation. That is to say, for the first time in history, the majority of the Chinese working people are celebrating their own festival freely and joyfully under the protection of their own government. How can this not make us and the working people of China feel very excited and proud!

Comrades! What does this change indicate?

This change indicates that the Chinese People's Great Revolution has been victorious, the Chinese working people have been liberated, the regime of the reactionary class that oppressed us and despised the working people has been overthrown by the power of the people, and the working people have established a people's regime based on themselves. This is the first and greatest victory the Chinese working people have achieved in history. We celebrate this greatest victory! Celebrate the 1950 May Day Labor Day! Celebrate the liberation of the Chinese working people!

Comrades! Why is May Day Labor Day worth celebrating so grandly by our country and people?

This is because the human world and even human beings themselves were created from labor. Labor is the foundation on which human society relies for its survival and development, and laborers are the creators of civilization. Therefore, labor should become the most respected thing in the world, laborers should become the most respected people in the world, and Labor Day should become one of the most memorable and celebrated festivals for our people and country. Labor Day is a festival of unity for our workers and all other working people, and a festival of international solidarity for workers and working people all over the world. On this day, we must commemorate the creations of all laborers with grand ceremonies, celebrate the achievements of laborers in their labor, thank laborers for giving mankind all the materials for production and life, and cultural and artistic enjoyment, and inspire the people's high enthusiasm for future labor creations. At the same time, we want to extend our brotherly greetings to the working class and working people of all countries in the world, especially to the working class and working people of the Soviet Union with the highest enthusiasm!

The Chinese People's Revolution has been victorious, and the Chinese working people have been liberated, but the views and habits of respecting those social parasites who do nothing and live without working and despising labor and laborers, which have existed in Chinese society for thousands of years, still exist. We must resolutely eliminate this completely wrong view and bad habit that has greatly wronged the working people when commemorating May Day Labor Day and in the future. We must give laborers, especially those labor heroes and inventors who have made major inventions and creations in the cause of labor, the glory they deserve, and give those social parasites who do nothing and live without working the contempt they deserve. This is one of the standards of our new morality.

This change that has taken place here and long ago in the Soviet Union and new democratic countries is indeed the greatest change in human history. The Chinese people, like the Soviet people, will gradually complete this change, and will gradually create their own infinitely beautiful future by relying on their own labor. Perhaps many people cannot imagine the great significance of this change today, but the more it goes on, the more clearly people will feel how far-reaching the prospects will be opened up by the changes that have begun here today. Obviously, this great change and the creation of a beautiful future can only be possible under the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party. Because of this change the Chinese Working class is already the leading class of the nation. It is precisely because the working class has become the leading class of the country that it can unite the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Communist Party to realize its historical mission, guarantee that our country will gradually embark on the road of prosperity and happiness, and gradually transition from new democracy to socialism.

But, comrades! When we celebrate the victory of the people and see the infinitely bright future, we cannot forget that we are still temporarily in a difficult situation. The remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries are still entrenched in Taiwan, Zhoushan, Jinmen and other islands, and with the help of American imperialism, they are bombing some of our cities and blockading some of our seaports. Therefore, we still have to carry out the battles to liberate Zhoushan, Jinmen, and Taiwan, and advance into Tibet. In some newly liberated areas in the rear, there are still many Kuomintang bandits waiting for us to wipe out. Last year, we also suffered from disasters in several provinces and regions, and millions of victims need the state to take out huge amounts of food for relief. Because our country's economic system was originally a semi-colonial economic system that could not be independent, an economic system that relied on imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism to survive and serve them, and was severely damaged in the long-term war, it will take many painful processes and require great efforts to transform this economic system into an independent economic system that relies on the people and serves the people, and to heal the wounds of war. It is precisely because this old economic order of the past has been broken and a new economic order has not had time to be established that serious disconnections and anarchy in various social and economic undertakings have emerged before us. Also, because of the false and superficial prosperity of certain economic undertakings caused by the effects of inflation and high prices in the past twelve years, when encountering the current situation of prices tending to be stable, there have also been temporary difficulties of sluggish sales of goods and reduced production. Due to these objective difficulties, coupled with some shortcomings and mistakes in our work, the current unemployment of some workers and certain difficulties in industry and commerce have been created. These difficulties need to be overcome by the joint efforts of the government and people from all walks of life, and this is completely surmountable.

Why are our current difficulties completely surmountable?

Because our current difficulties are difficulties in victory, difficulties in progress, and victory and progress themselves contain all the factors to overcome difficulties. As long as we are good at using these factors and creating the necessary conditions, we can overcome these difficulties. Therefore, our difficulties are only temporary difficulties.

We do have difficulties at the moment, and everyone knows this. But if we analyze the current situation, we can clearly see that the basic conditions for China's economic and industrial development have either been created or are being created. Therefore, we have full confidence to overcome the current difficulties and gradually improve the situation. I can list some of these basic conditions as follows:

First, imperialism has been driven out of China, many privileges of imperialism in China have been abolished, and the new China's customs policy and foreign trade policy have become important tools to protect the development of new China's industry. That is to say, we have put the key to China's door in our own pocket, not in the pocket of imperialism and its running dogs as in the past. From now on, Chinese industry will not be subject to competition from cheap goods from imperialism, and China's raw materials will first be supplied to its own industrial needs. This removes one of the biggest obstacles that have prevented the development of Chinese industry for a hundred years.

Second, the People's Liberation War is nearing a victorious end. The People's Liberation Army's recent successful landing in front of the enemy's strong fortifications on Hainan Island and defeating a large number of enemy troops, and thus the experience of liberating the entire island, can be used for the advance to Taiwan and other enemy-occupied islands. After the liberation of Taiwan, the enemy's blockade and bombing will naturally end, the country's military and political expenses can be greatly reduced, and a large increase in investment in economic construction will become possible. Our country will completely turn to the track of economic construction. This is entirely predictable.

The Northeast has now completely turned to the track of economic construction. In 1950, in addition to handing over 2.6 million tons of coarse grains to the Central People's Government to support the war, provide disaster relief, and develop production, the Northeast People's Government had 3.99 million tons of grain (converted into millet in the interior) invested in economic undertakings in the Northeast in their budget. According to the report of Chairman Gao Gang of the Northeast People's Government, in 1949, industrial production in the Northeast accounted for 35% of the total value of industrial and agricultural production. In 1950, it will rise to 43%. This year, the production of state-owned industry in the Northeast will be equal to 193% of that in 1949. Agricultural production will be equal to 137% of that in 1949. In 1949, the number of employees in state-owned industry in the Northeast increased by 240,000, and the actual wages of employees increased by an average of 27%. In 1950, the profits and depreciation fees received by the state from state-owned enterprises in the Northeast will almost account for half of the total state revenue in the Northeast. The burden on farmers in the Northeast was already lighter in 1949 than in 1948, and it will be relatively lighter in 1950. The private industry and commerce in the Northeast have also developed. For example, in Shenyang, in 1949, the number of private industrialists increased by 23%, and the number of workers they employed increased by 18%. There are no unemployed workers in the Northeast, and there is a shortage of workers. The people's lives in the Northeast have begun to improve, the demand for various consumer goods has greatly increased, and the market has greatly expanded. These facts that have already appeared in the Northeast will definitely appear in the interior in the near future. This indicates that the prospects for China's economy and China's industrial development are completely bright.

In addition to the Northeast, in the interior, economic construction has now begun in vast areas, and the People's Government is carrying out focused economic recovery. In 1950, the Central People's Government's investment in economic undertakings was also 3.93 million tons of grain. If the interior and the exterior are combined, the People's Government's investment in economic undertakings this year is a total of 7.92 million tons of grain, which is equivalent to about 700 million US dollars. In addition to these investments, the amount of loans from the National Bank to public and private enterprises is also very large. Everyone knows that these investments and loans are still made by the People's Government under the difficult circumstances of war and disaster. If the war ends, financial prices are completely stable, military and political expenses are greatly reduced, and the country can be used for economic undertakings, it is not difficult to imagine the degree to which investment will be increased. This will undoubtedly promote the rapid recovery and development of the economy.

Third, the land reform in the Northeast and North China, except for Suiyuan, has ended. Land reform in Henan and other regions will be completed this year. Land reform in some newly liberated areas will begin after the autumn of this year in accordance with the orders of the People's Government, and land reform throughout the country will be basically completed within two or three years. In this way, the productive forces of the countryside can be liberated, and the cities can be supplied with sufficient food and raw materials, and the market problem for industrial development can be solved. To give another example of the Northeast: In 1947, 800,000 bolts of cloth were sold in the Northeast, 1.2 million bolts in 1948, 3.2 million bolts in 1949, and it is estimated that it may reach 9 million bolts in 1950. In the first quarter of 1950, 2.5 million bolts have already been sold. That is to say, after the land reform, the farmers' production increased, their lives improved, and their purchasing power greatly increased, and the market for industrial products was greatly expanded. We have created or are about to create this most fundamental and important condition that stimulates industrial development. The shrinking purchasing power in the countryside now will quickly recover and gradually expand after the completion of land reform and two or three decent years of good harvests, thereby making the urban industry and commerce prosper. This is also undoubtedly true.

Fourth, the country's financial and economic work has now been unified, the country's financial revenue and expenditure are close to balance, and may soon be completely balanced, and financial prices are tending to be stable. This is in the interests of the vast majority of people in the country. This is the biggest work done by the People's Government for the people since the establishment of the Central People's Government, in addition to the victory of the People's Liberation Army on the front line. China's financial economy has never been unified in history. The country's financial revenue and expenditure have not been balanced in the past few decades. The reactionary government had to issue huge amounts of banknotes and hold huge domestic and foreign debts every year to make ends meet. China's financial prices have not been stable for twelve years, and the people must pay huge amounts of money in the losses of inflation. However, the People's Government has achieved these major measures and achieved such results in a very short period of time under the circumstances that the war has not ended and disasters have occurred and imperialism has sealed off the country. This cannot be done by any reactionary government, and only a truly people's government can do it. This proves that our slogan of unifying China is not an empty phrase, but has strict political, military and economic content. This is an extremely important progress in our country. Under this progress, a condition for recovery and development has been created for all legitimate industry and commerce and other productive undertakings, so that capital will not be used for speculative undertakings or lost in inflation, but will be used in legitimate industry and commerce and other productive undertakings.

Naturally, when this new situation of progress is born, some pain and difficulties are inevitably produced. This is like the labor pains before a woman gives birth. In order to balance revenue and expenditure and stabilize prices, the People's Government has to strictly collect public grain, taxes, and issue some public bonds, and strictly save expenses. Otherwise, it can only be the continued expansion of currency and the continued fluctuation of prices. However, the result of strictly collecting public grain, taxes, and issuing public bonds has increased the burden on the people in rural and urban areas, which has caused difficulties for many people. The result of saving expenses has made millions of military and government personnel continue to live a hard life of the supply system, and cannot or rarely be able to take care of their families, so that many of their families live a hard life or even a half-full life. This also gave these people difficulties. These are manifestations of labor pains before childbirth. After these labor pains, a new situation has emerged in which financial revenue and expenditure are close to balance and prices are tending to be stable. After the new situation of prices tending to be stable appeared, the hoarding behavior in the past stopped, and speculators had to sell the goods they had hoarded in the past to the market. Many consumers have also purchased and stored a lot of consumer goods during the period of inflation in the past. Now, even if these consumers get money, they will not go to buy consumer goods temporarily, but put the money in their pockets or deposit it in the bank. Therefore, there has been a phenomenon of sluggish sales of goods and falling prices, bank deposits have greatly increased and it is difficult to release them, a part of factories have overproduction, and many stores have goods that cannot be sold, so it is difficult to maintain, and a phenomenon of unemployment of some workers has occurred. This is also the pain and difficulty that must be produced after the price tends to be stable, and it is unavoidable.

Of course, if all the doctors and assistants in our People's Government's obstetrical hospital are very capable, and all kinds of midwifery equipment and medicines are complete, it is possible to reduce some pain and difficulties when this new situation is about to be born. But unfortunately, not all the doctors and assistants in our obstetrical hospital are capable, and the preparation of various equipment and medicines is not complete. They can only work, study, and gradually sum up experience and accumulate experience in various creative works. This has made some pain and difficulties that could have been avoided not been avoided. These are the various shortcomings and mistakes that have occurred in the work of many of our comrades. These shortcomings and mistakes must be seriously corrected. We hope that the people will criticize the government's work and make relevant suggestions so as to urge the government's staff to correct these shortcomings and mistakes, so as to reduce those unnecessary pain and difficulties.

There are shortcomings and mistakes, and there are pain and difficulties, but after all, a new situation of close to balanced income and expenditure and stable prices has begun to appear before us. Comrades! Compatriots from all walks of life! Grit your teeth, continue to work hard, and after a considerable period of time, the critical moment can pass. Our pain and difficulties are only temporary phenomena, and this is also undoubtedly true.

Fifth, the international conditions for our construction are also very good. After the end of the war and the reunification of the country, we urgently need a peaceful environment to carry out economic construction. The People's Government will naturally earnestly implement a peaceful policy in diplomacy and work with the Soviet Union and various new democratic countries to safeguard world peace. This is extremely clear. The imperialists have great hatred for the liberation of the Chinese people, and American imperialism is still helping the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan and carrying out various conspiracies to sabotage the new China. Therefore, the people of the whole country and the People's Liberation Army must raise their vigilance, must resolutely liberate Taiwan and consolidate national defense, and be prepared to deal with any possible provocations by imperialism. However, the imperialist aggression front headed by the United States has met and will continue to meet the resolute resistance of peace-loving people all over the world. The strength of the peace and democracy front headed by the Soviet Union has been unprecedentedly strengthened. If the imperialists dare to provoke and dare to take the risk of war, the result will be the complete demise of the imperialist system. Due to the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance, we have a strong ally. As Chairman Mao Zedong said: It will enable us to carry out construction work with peace of mind. We have also obtained low-interest loans and expert assistance from the Soviet Union, and we have carried out economic cooperation with the Soviet Union on several undertakings that we cannot undertake ourselves in the short term. This can also reduce our difficulties of insufficient capital and experience.

Combining the above various favorable conditions, we can see that our current difficulties will be overcome by us one by one, and our economic situation will gradually improve after a short period of difficulty, and will fundamentally improve in two or three years. There is no room for doubt.

Based on the above analysis, we can understand what our current tasks and the direction of efforts of the Chinese people should be. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has clearly and correctly put forward the tasks in all aspects in the thirty-eight slogans issued for the celebration of May Day Labor Day. I will now add some explanations to the following tasks:

1. Liberate Taiwan and Tibet, eliminate bandits and secret agents, and consolidate national defense.

The People's Liberation Army units undertaking the frontline tasks should actively prepare for the advance to liberate Tibet, Taiwan, and other enemy-occupied islands, so as to end the war throughout the country. The People's Liberation Army units, public security organs, and public security forces undertaking the tasks in the rear should eliminate bandits and secret agents as quickly as possible, and protect social security, so that the people can work in peace and also carry out production, learn culture, improve military skills, and consolidate national defense. This is the biggest demand of the people of the whole country at present. The people of the whole country, including the people of Taiwan and Tibet, should use their greatest efforts to support and cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to complete this glorious task. Here, we would also like to say a few words to the Kuomintang generals on Taiwan and other islands and the rulers of Tibet: Immediately stop your desperate resistance, sever all relations with imperialism, and send representatives to the People's Liberation Army to negotiate, or stage an uprising, or lay down your weapons to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army's actions to liberate these areas. If you can do this, the People's Government may be able to pardon your past crimes, and you will have the basic reason to ask the People's Government to forgive your past and examine your future. This is your last chance to be forgiven by the people.

2. Adjust the relationship between industry and commerce and the relationship between public and private sectors.

The Central People's Government will soon take some concrete measures based on the Common Program and Chairman Mao Zedong's instructions to adjust the relationship between industry and commerce and the relationship between public and private sectors, so as to organize and plan our country's economic life under the current conditions, so as to overcome many of the situations and anarchy that have not yet entered the right track between public and private enterprises and between various enterprise departments. The People's Government should help those private production undertakings that are possible to maintain and are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood but are in difficulty. The owners and workers of these enterprises must also do their best and work together to maintain these enterprises and wait for the situation to improve. In order to adjust the relationship between industry and commerce and the relationship between public and private sectors to overcome the current difficulties, it is extremely important to unify and distribute all the orders and processing of state organs and state-owned enterprises as appropriately as possible. The number of these orders and processing is extremely large, and because there is no appropriate unity and distribution, various problems and losses often occur. Our military and government organs and enterprise organs should make a certain period of order budget and processing budget as much as possible, one by one, especially large-scale order and processing budgets, and put forward their own opinions to the industrial, commercial, and trade organs. At the same time, the local industrial, commercial, and trade organs should truthfully report their production situation to the local public and private production organs and conduct investigations and report to the higher authorities. In this way, our central industrial, commercial, and trade organs can unify and distribute various national orders and various processing within an appropriate scope, and regulate the production of various enterprises. In this way, on the one hand, state organs can avoid some unnecessary losses, and on the other hand, they can regulate the market, regulate production, help many difficult production undertakings, and stimulate the development of new production undertakings. It is necessary to take care of the particularly difficult Shanghai industry and commerce in terms of national orders and processing.

3. The transfer of some productions and the outlet of private capital.

Enterprises that used to serve imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, such as the high-end consumer goods industry, the superstitious goods industry, the speculative business, and the financial industry for the purpose of lending high interest and buying and selling short, have no future, and they should change their careers. In addition, some industries that are temporarily overproduced, such as the cigarette, match, and soap industries, have to temporarily reduce production or change their careers. There are also some enterprises that need to truly change their products to products suitable for farmers in order to expand sales. Also, due to the cessation of speculative undertakings, the society already has a large amount of floating capital that requires investment in production undertakings. From a fundamental point of view, there is no doubt that these are good phenomena. There is no doubt that this will produce some pain. Reducing production, suspending work, and changing careers will inevitably produce some unemployment or changes of profession. Some people are already asking: I am willing to change my career, but where should I change to? Please tell me what business can be done by the People's Government? This question is asked correctly. To answer each such question in a concrete and accurate manner requires concrete investigation and research. Now I can only give a general answer to the general direction. That is to say, any undertaking that appropriately serves the needs of the people, especially appropriately serves the needs of the farmers, and that the state cannot do now, or that although it has done it but still has very few, can be done. The transportation business and the business that serves the key recovery departments of the national economy, and the medical business can also be done. In addition, the state can sign contracts with private individuals under appropriate conditions and allow private individuals to handle the mining and refining of certain special minerals, the establishment of certain special factories, and the installation of certain power stations. Now the People's Government has not prohibited private individuals from establishing any undertaking that is not manipulating the national economy and the people's livelihood but is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, so the scope of activities of private undertakings is very broad. Some inappropriate competition between state-owned enterprises and private production undertakings, and some inappropriate conditions in orders and processing should be corrected in the work of adjusting industry and commerce. Labor-management relations can also be brought into line in national labor laws, collective contracts, and labor-management consultation organizations. Therefore, private capital does not have no outlet. Of course, they should honestly and without fear of spending some capital and effort to operate those undertakings that are truly beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The People's Government should provide all necessary convenience conditions and guidance to entrepreneurs who honestly and without fear of spending some capital and effort to operate production undertakings, so as to avoid blindness and help the success of their undertakings.

4. Relieving disaster victims and relieving unemployed workers.

Through the efforts of the People's Government and the broad masses of the people, we can say with certainty that our grain situation this year is guaranteed. There are only forty days left before the wheat harvest, and now is the critical moment for disaster relief. Therefore, disaster relief personnel in various places should not retain but release the disaster relief grain allocated by the government to various places under the principle of disaster victims' self-reliance in production so as to enable disaster victims to overcome difficulties. Due to the efforts of the people themselves and the large-scale organizational work of the People's Government, it has been determined that this year's disaster can be overcome without the relief of a grain of foreign grain. After helping the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang kill millions of Chinese people, the American imperialists suddenly pretended to be philanthropists and said that they wanted to relieve the disaster victims here. The purpose of their so-called disaster relief is to carry out sabotage activities among the disaster victims in China. Although the Chinese people welcome those foreign aid that is truly well-intentioned, we have learned enough about the "good intentions" of the imperialists, and we do not need these people to carry out sabotage activities.

Since the reduction, suspension, and transfer of certain economic undertakings are inevitable, it is completely necessary and urgent to relieve unemployed workers in major cities within the possible scope. The Central People's Government has decided to allocate a batch of grain and funds, and also requires industrialists and businessmen and workers in employment to take out a part of the money as a fund to relieve unemployed workers. The Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government is drafting methods for relieving unemployed workers and is preparing to establish unemployment relief offices and job placement offices in major cities. Before the central method is issued, Shanghai and other cities can and should implement a temporary relief. The Chinese government has never relieved unemployed workers in the past, and the People's Government, although still in difficulty today, will stipulate and implement effective relief methods for unemployed workers.

5. Future land reform.

After the autumn of this year, land reform should be implemented in those newly liberated areas that have been prepared, but this area should not be too wide. In the situation that the war has basically won victory, we believe that in the future land reform, we should only confiscate the land of landlords and many public lands and distribute them to farmers who have no land or little land. Landlords would also get a share, and we will not touch the land and property of rich peasants. For other properties of landlords, except for a part of the production materials necessary for farmers, they will not be confiscated and distributed. The new land law will stipulate these issues. In view of past experience, we believe that in the future implementation of land reform, it should be completely led, prepared, and orderly, and the occurrence of chaotic phenomena should not be allowed. Therefore, we cannot rush to complete the land reform in all newly liberated areas, but must complete the land reform in several steps and in stages and regions. If we can basically complete the land reform throughout the country in the next three years, it will be very fast and a great victory.

6. Seriously correct shortcomings and mistakes, and rectify and train cadres.

Since the People's Liberation Army's field armies began to advance to the south and northwest on April 20 last year, in a very short period of time, all the Chinese mainland except Tibet, including areas with more than 300 million people, has been liberated. The areas we occupy are so large, the work is extremely heavy and complex, there are insufficient experienced cadres, a large number of new cadres have been absorbed, and there is no time to rectify and train them. Therefore, along with the great achievements in the work, there are many shortcomings and mistakes. We must look at the problem comprehensively. We should see the achievements of the work and the shortcomings and mistakes in the work, the arduous efforts of the cadres and the problems that have occurred among the cadres, and we must not underestimate any aspect. Now the people of the whole country praise our achievements, but at the same time, they ask us to correct the shortcomings and mistakes that have occurred. We should face these shortcomings and mistakes and correct them. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has made a decision to carry out criticism and self-criticism and to rectify and train working cadres. After these steps have been carried out, we believe that our shortcomings and mistakes can be corrected.

The most serious mistake is the mistake of commandism. We have quite a few cadres who are also fighting to complete the tasks given to them by the country and the Party. This is good, but they do not pay attention to implementing the policies of the country and the Party. They do not complete the tasks given to them by the country and the Party within the limits of strictly following the policies of the country and the Party, but take a rude method to carry out their work, do not pay attention to the specific situation, do not take into account whether it is possible in fact, and are not willing to humbly consult with the local people. They just simply complete the task. As a result, the task is completed, but the people have suffered losses that could have been avoided. This commandist style of work has been quite serious in the work of collecting grain, taxes, and promoting public bonds, and has caused dissatisfaction among many people. If it is not corrected, we will be separated from the masses. Soon after, we will carry out land reform in a vast area. If we do not seize the time to rectify and train cadres, the land reform work will be difficult to do well.

Regarding this commandist style of work among our cadres, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued instructions over the years, focusing on correction. However, even after multiple corrections, it can still occur. Now the Communist Party has more than 4 million members, of which nearly 2 million have only two and a half years, two years, one year, or a few months of party membership. In government agencies, a large number of old personnel have been received in the past year or so to engage in work. Under this completely new situation, we are required to immediately start a large-scale rectification and training work, first of all, the rectification and training of cadres. The main thing is to summarize the work, correct the commandist style of work, and secondly, to correct other mistakes and shortcomings.

Comrades! If our work style is better, our shortcomings and mistakes are less, and our work is done better, then we can better unite the people of the whole country, we can higher inspire the enthusiasm of the people of the whole country, we can increase the people's greater strength, and we can enable our country and people to overcome the current difficulties and create a better future more quickly. And all of this is exactly the purpose we want to achieve when celebrating this year's May Day Labor Day.

Long live the great May Day Labor Day - the festival of unity of the working people of China and the world!

Long live the unity and cooperation of all ethnic groups, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, and all people's organizations in China!

　　在北京庆祝五一劳动节干部大会上的演说
    刘少奇同志们！
    我们现在庆祝中华人民共和国成立以后第一个五一劳动节，我们是感到十分兴奋的。因为在已往的年代，除开解放区外，中国大多数的劳动人民在庆祝自己的节日——五一劳动节的时候，不独是不能受到政府的保护，相反，还要受到反磕动政府的严厉禁止，劳动人民只能在反动军队和特务警察的严密监视之下，并和他们进行不顾牺牲的斗争的条件之下，才能举行庆祝与度过自己的节日。但是中国劳动人民在庆祝今年五一劳动节的时候，情形就完全不同了。五一劳动节已被中央人民政府订为国家最重要的合法节日之一，并命令工厂、作坊、机关、学校和人民解放军的部队在这一天放假，人民的军队和警察不独不会来禁止人民举行庆祝与游行，相反，他们将和人民一道参加庆祝与游行。保护劳动人民在安静和欢乐的情形之下来庆祝自己的五一劳动节，乃是人民政府的职责。这就是说，中国大多数的劳动人民从有史以来才第一次在自己政府的保护之下，在自由欢乐的情景之中，庆祝自己的节日。这怎能不使我们和全中国的劳动人民感到十分的兴奋和骄傲呢！
    同志们！这种情形的变化是表示什么呢？
    这种变化就是表示：中国人民大革命已经胜利了，中国的劳动人民已经获得了解放，压迫我们、贱视劳动人民的反动阶级的政权已经被人民的力量打倒了，劳动人民已经建立了以自己为基础的人民政权了。这是中国劳动人民从有史以来所获得的第一次最伟大的胜利。我们庆祝这一个最伟大的胜利！庆祝一九五○年的五一劳动节！庆祝中国劳动人民的解放！
    同志们！五一劳动节为什么值得我们的国家和人民这样隆重地来举行庆祝呢？
    这就是因为人类世界以至人类本身乃是从劳动中创造的。劳动乃是人类社会赖以生存和发展的基础，劳动者乃是文明的创造者。因此，劳动应该成为世界上最受尊敬的事情，劳动者应该成为世界上最受尊敬的人们，而劳动节就应该成为我们人民和国家最值得纪念和庆祝的一个节日。劳动节乃是我们工人及其他一切劳动人民团结的节日，乃是全世界的工人和劳动人民国际团结的节日。我们在这一天，要以隆重的仪式来纪念一切劳动者的创造，庆祝劳动者在劳动中所获得的成果，感谢劳动者给予人类一切生产和生活的资料与文化艺术上的享受，并为以后的劳动创造鼓舞起人民的高度热情。同时，我们要以最高的热情向世界各国的工人阶级和劳动人民、首先是向苏联的工人阶级和劳动人民致以兄弟的敬礼！
    中国人民革命是胜利了，中国劳动人民是解放了，但是在中国社会上存在了几千年的尊敬那些无所事事不劳而食的社会寄生虫、而贱视劳动和劳动者的观点和习惯，是仍然存在着的。这样一种完全错误的、使劳动人民受到极大冤屈的观点和恶习，我们在纪念五一劳动节及在以后的时候，必须坚决地加以肃清。我们必须给劳动者、特别是那些在劳动事业中有重大发明和创造的劳动英雄们和发明家们以应得的光荣，而给那些无所事事、不劳而食的社会寄生虫以应得的贱视。这就是我们的新道德的标准之一。
    在我们这里以及很早就在苏联及新民主主义国家中所发生的这种变革，诚然是人类历史上最伟大的变革。中国人民将和苏联人民一样，逐步地完成这种变革，并将倚靠自己的劳动，逐步地创造自己无限美好的将来。这种变革的伟大意义，今天或许还有不少的人们想像不到，但是愈到后来，人们就会愈加明显地感觉到今天在我们这里开始的变革将开辟怎样远大的前程。很明显，这种伟大的变革以及将来美好前途的创造，只有在工人阶级和共产党的领导之下，才有可能。由于这种变革，中国工人阶级已经成为国家的领导阶级。正因为工人阶级已经成为国家的领导阶级，它在共产党的领导之下实现自己的历史任务，它就能团结全国人民，保证我们的国家逐步地走上富强康乐的境地，逐步地由新民主主义过渡到社会主义。
    但是，同志们！在我们庆祝人民的胜利并看到了无限光明前途的时候，我们不能忘记：我们暂时地还是处在困难的情况中。国民党反动派的残余还盘据在台湾、舟山、金门诸海岛上并在美国帝国主义的帮助之下轰炸我们的若干城市，封锁我们的若干海口，因此，我们还须进行解放舟山、金门、台湾的战役，并要进军到西藏去。在后方的若干新解放地区尚有许多国民党土匪待我们去肃清。我们去年又在几个省区内遭到了灾荒，有成百万的灾民须要国家拿出巨额的粮食去救济。由于我们国家的经济制度原来是不能独立的半殖民地经济制度，是倚赖帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义而生存并为它们服务的经济制度，又在长期战争中受到了严重的破坏，要把这种经济制度改造成为独立的、倚靠人民并服务于人民的经济制度，医治战争的创伤，是要经过许多痛苦的过程并需要进行巨大的努力，才能达到的。正因为过去的这种旧的经济秩序已被打破、新的经济秩序还没有来得及建立的时候，在我们面前就出现了各个社会经济事业中的严重的脱节与无政府状态。又由于过去十二年来通货膨胀、物价高涨的影响所造成的某些经济事业的虚假的表面的繁荣状态，遇到了今天物价趋向稳定的局面，也发生了暂时的货物滞销、生产缩减的困难。由于以上这些客观的困难，再加上我们在工作中的某些缺点和错误，就造成了目前一部分工人的失业和工商业中的某些困难情形。这些困难，是须要政府与各界人民共同协力来加以克服的，这也是完全能够克服的。
    为什么我们目前的困难是完全能够克服的困难呢？
    因为我们目前的困难乃是胜利中的困难，进步中的困难，而胜利与进步的本身就包含着克服困难的一切因素，只要我们善于利用这些因素，创造出必要的条件，我们就能克服这些困难。因此，我们的困难乃是暂时的困难。
    我们目前确实有困难，这是大家知道的。但是，如果对目前的情况加以分析，我们就可以清楚地看到：使中国经济和工业发展的基本条件或者已经创造起来，或者正在创造中，因此，我们具有充分的信心去克服目前的困难，并使情况逐步地走向好转。这些基本条件我可以举出以下一些：
    第一，帝国主义已经从中国赶走，帝国主义在中国的许多特权已经被取消，新中国的海关政策与对外贸易政策已经成为保护新中国工业发展的重要工具。这就是说，我们已把中国大门的钥匙放在自己的袋子里，而不是如过去一样放在帝国主义及其走狗的袋子里。从今以后，中国工业就不致受到帝国主义的廉价商品的竞争，中国的原料将首先供给自己工业的需要。这就扫除了一百年来使中国工业不能发展的一个最大的障碍。
    第二，人民解放战争已接近于胜利的结束。人民解放军最近在海南岛敌人强固工事面前的胜利登陆，并击溃大量敌军，因而即将解放全岛的经验，可以用于向台湾及其他敌占岛屿的进军上面去。在台湾解放以后，敌人的封锁与轰炸自然结束，国家的军政费用就可大量缩减，大量增加经济建设的投资也就成为可能，我们的国家就将完全转入经济建设的轨道上去。这是完全可以预料得到的。
    现在东北已经完全转入经济建设的轨道上去了。东北人民政府在一九五○年，除开即将解交中央人民政府二百六十万吨粗粮，用以支援战争、救济灾荒及发展生产而外，在他们的预算中，有三百九十九万吨粮食（折成关内小米计算）投资于东北的经济事业。据东北人民政府高岗主席的报告：东北的工业生产，在一九四九年，占工农业生产总额的百分之三十五。在一九五○年，即将上升至百分之四十三。今年东北公营工业的生产，将等于一九四九年的百分之一百九十三。农业生产，将等于一九四九年的百分之一百三十七。一九四九年，东北公营工业的就业人数，增加了二十四万人，职工实际工资，平均增加了百分之二十七。一九五○年，国家从东北国营企业中收入的利润与折旧费，差不多要占东北国家总收入的一半。东北农民的负担，在一九四九年已比一九四八年减轻了，一九五○年还要相对地减轻一些。东北的私人工商业也有发展。如沈阳，在一九四九年，私人工业家数增加了百分之二十三，其雇用工人数目增加了百分之十八。东北已经没有了失业工人，并已感到工人不足。东北人民的生活已开始有了改善，各种消费品的需要量大增，市场有了很大的扩大。在东北已经出现的这些事实，在不久的将来，在关内也一定会要出现的。这就指明，中国经济与中国工业发展的前途是完全光明的。
    除东北外，在关内，现在也已在广大地区内开始转入经济建设，人民政府已在进行有重点的恢复经济。在一九五○年中央人民政府用于经济事业的投资，也有三百九十三万吨粮食。如把关内关外合计，人民政府在今年对于经济事业的投资共有七百九十二万吨粮食，折成美金约有七亿美元左右。除开这些投资以外，国家银行对公私企业贷款的数目也是很大的。大家知道，这些投资与贷款还是人民政府在战争与灾荒等困难的情况之下所作到的。如果战争结束，金融物价完全稳定，军政费用大量缩减，国家能够用于经济事业的投资将会提高到怎样一种程度，是不难想像到的。这将促进经济的迅速恢复与发展，乃是毫无疑问的。
    第三，东北与华北的土地改革除绥远外，已经结束。河南及其他若干地区的土地改革，将在今年完成。若干新解放区的土地改革，将依照人民政府的命令在今年秋后开始，并将在两三年内基本上完成全国的土地改革。如此，就能解放农村的生产力，以充分的粮食和原料供给城市，解决工业发展的市场问题。再举东北为例：一九四七年在东北销售的布匹是八十万匹，一九四八年是一百二十万匹，一九四九年是三百二十万匹，一九五○年预计可能达到九百万匹，一九五○年第一季度已经销售了二百五十万匹。这就是说，农民在土地改革后，生产增加，生活改善，购买力大大提高，工业品的销售市场就大为扩大。这一个刺激工业发展的最根本最重要的条件，我们已经创造或者即将创造出来。现在农村中萎缩的购买力，只待完成土地改革，又有两三个像样的丰收年成，就将迅速恢复，并将逐步扩大，因而使城市工商业繁荣起来，这也是无可怀疑的。
    第四，现在国家的财政经济工作已经统一，国家的财政收支已接近平衡，不久可能完全平衡，金融物价已趋向稳定。这是全国最大多数人民的利益。这是除开人民解放军在前线上的胜利以外，从中央人民政府成立以来为人民所做的一件最大的工作。中国的财政经济，在历史上是没有统一过的。国家财政收支，在过去数十年中也没有平衡过，反动政府每年必须发行巨额的钞票和举行巨额的内外债才能过日子。中国的金融物价也是十二年来没有稳定过的，人民必须在通货膨胀的损失中付出巨额的资金。但是人民政府在战争尚未结束与发生灾荒及帝国主义封销等情况之下，在很短的时期内，就实现了这些重大的措施，并达到这样的成绩。这是任何反动政府都不能作到的，只有真正的人民政府才能作到。这就证明：我们统一中国的口号不是一句空话，而是有其严格的政治、军事和经济内容的。这是我们国家一个极为重大的进步。在这种进步之下，就为一切正当的工商业及其他生产事业创造了一个恢复和发展的条件，使资本不致用于投机事业或损失于通货膨胀，而用在正当的工商业及其他生产事业上去。
    自然，在这种进步的新局面出生的时候，不可避免地产生了一些痛苦和困难。这正如产妇在分娩以前有阵痛一样。人民政府为了平衡收支、稳定物价，就不能不严格地征收公粮、税款和发行一些公债，并严格地节省开支。否则，就只能是通货的继续膨胀和物价的继续波动。但是，严格地征收公粮、税款和发行公债的结果，就使农村和城市人民的负担有些部分是加重了，这就给了许多人以困难。节省开支的结果，就使数百万军政人员继续过着艰苦的供给制生活，不能或很少可能照顾他们的家庭，使他们的不少家庭过着艰苦的甚至半饱的生活。这也给了这些人以困难。这些就是分娩前阵痛的一种表现。在这些阵痛之后，是出现了财政收支接近平衡，物价趋向稳定的新局面。在物价趋向稳定的新局面出现之后，过去囤积居奇的行为就停止了，投机者还不得不向市场抛售过去囤积的货物。许多消费者也因在过去通货膨胀时期购存了不少的消费品，现在这些消费者即使得到货币，也暂时不去购买消费品，而把货币放在袋子内，或者存入银行。因此，就发生货物滞销并跌价，银行的货币存款大增而难于放出，一部分工厂生产过剩，许多商店存货卖不出，因而难于维持，发生一部分工人失业的现象。这也是在物价趋向稳定后必然要产生的痛苦和困难，也是不能避免的。
    当然，如果我们人民政府这个产科医院的一切医生和助手都是很高明的，各种助产设备和药剂都很齐备，在临到这个新局面出生时是可以减少一些痛苦和困难的。但是可惜，我们这个产科医院的一切医生和助手并不个个都是高明的，各种设备和药剂的准备也不完全。他们只能在各项创造性的工作中一面工作，一面学习，逐步总结经验和积累经验。这样就使得一些本来可以避免的痛苦和困难没有能够避免。这就是我们的许多同志在工作中所发生的各种缺点与错误。这些缺点和错误，必须认真地加以纠正。我们希望人民群众对于政府工作展开批评，并提出相当的建议，以便督促政府的工作人员纠正这些缺点和错误，以便减少那些不必要的痛苦和困难。
    缺点和错误是有的，痛苦和困难也是有的，但是毕竟在我们面前开始出现了收支接近平衡、物价趋向稳定的新局面。同志们！各界同胞们！咬紧牙关，继续努力，在一个相当时期之后，紧要的关头就可以过去。我们的痛苦和困难只是暂时的现象，这也是无可怀疑的。
    第五，我们进行建设的国际条件也是很好的。在战争结束、全国统一之后，我们是迫切需要和平环境来进行经济建设的。人民政府在外交方面自当切实执行和平政策，与苏联及各新民主国家一道为保障世界和平而努力。这是异常清楚的，帝国主义者对于中国人民的解放具有极大的仇恨，美国帝国主义还正在援助台湾蒋介石匪帮，对于新中国进行各种阴谋破坏活动，因此，全国人民和人民解放军必须提高自己的警惕性，必须坚决解放台湾和巩固国防，并准备对付帝国主义的任何可能的挑衅。但是以美国为首的帝国主义侵略阵线，业已遇到并还要遇到全世界爱好和平人类的坚决抵抗。以苏联为首的和平民主阵线的力量已经空前地壮大起来了。帝国主义者如果敢于挑衅，敢于进行战争的冒险，其结果就将是帝国主义制度的全部灭亡。由于中苏友好同盟互助条约的签订，我们已经有了一个强有力的同盟者。正如毛泽东主席所说：它将使我们能够放手地去进行建设工作。我们又从苏联获得了低利贷款和专家的帮助，并就短时期内我们自己无法举办的几项事业和苏联实行经济合作，这也就可以减少我们资本和经验不足的困难。
    综合以上各种有利条件来看，我们目前的困难将要一个一个地被我们克服，我们的经济情况在经过短时期的困难以后，会要逐步地走向好转，并将在两三年后走向根本的好转，乃是没有可以怀疑的余地了。
    根据以上的分析，我们就可以了解，我们当前的任务和中国人民努力的方向，应该是什么了。中共中央在为庆祝五一劳动节所发布的三十八条口号中，已经清楚而正确地提出了各方面的任务。我现在只就以下几个任务来加一些说明：
    一、解放台湾、西藏，肃清土匪特务，巩固国防。
    担任前线任务的人民解放军部队，应该积极地准备解放西藏、台湾及其他敌占海岛的进军，以便在全国范围内结束战争。担任后方任务的人民解放军部队、公安机关和公安部队，应该尽可能迅速地肃清土匪，肃清特务分子，保卫社会治安，以便使人民能够安心生产，同时自己也进行生产，学习文化，提高军事技术，巩固国防。这是全国人民当前最大的要求。全国人民，包括台湾、西藏的人民在内，应当用最大的努力来支援与配合人民解放军去完成这个光荣的任务。我们在这里，还要向台湾及其他海岛上的国民党将军和西藏的统治者们说几句话：立即停止你们的绝望的抵抗，断绝与帝国主义的一切关系，并派遣代表到人民解放军来进行谈判，或者举行起义，或者放下你们的武器，以配合人民解放军解放这些地区的行动。如果你们能够这样做，人民政府对于你们既往的罪行才有可能加以赦免，你们也才有起码的理由请求人民政府原谅你们的过去并考察你们的将来。这是你们最后一次取谅于人民的机会了。
    二、调整工商业与公私关系。
    中央人民政府即将根据共同纲领与毛泽东主席的指示，采取一些具体办法来调整工商业与公私关系，使我们国家的经济生活在目前的条件下加以组织与计划，以便克服公私企业之间以及各企业部门之间许多尚未进入正轨的状态和无政府状态。对于那些有可能维持、又于国计民生有益、但是发生困难的私人生产事业，人民政府应该给以帮助，这些企业的主人和工人群众也必须各尽所能，共同协力，以便把这些企业维持下来，等待情况的好转。为了调整工商业与公私关系以克服目前的困难，尽可能适当地统一与分配一切国家机关和国家企业的定货和加工，是有极重要的作用的。这些定货和加工的数量极大，因为没有适当的统一和分配，常常发生各种毛病和损失。应该使我们的军政机关和企业机关尽可能地、一个一个地作出一定时期的定货预算和加工预算特别是大批的定货和加工预算，并提出自己的意见，交给工商贸易机关。同时，各地工商贸易机关应该要各地公私生产机关据实报告自己的生产情况，并加以调查，报告上级。这样，就使我们的中央工商贸易机关有可能在适当的范围内统一与分配国家的各种定货和各种加工，并调节各企业的生产。这样，一方面，可使国家机关避免一些不必要的损失，另一方面，又可调剂市场，调节生产，救济许多困难的生产事业，并可刺激新的生产事业的发展。在国家定货和加工等方面照顾特别困难的上海工商业，乃是必要的。
    三、某些生产的转业与私人资本的出路。
    过去服务于帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的企业，例如高级消费品工业，迷信品工业，投机商业，以放高利贷和买空卖空为目的的金融业等，是没有前途的，他们应该转业。又有某些暂时生产过剩的工业，例如纸烟、火柴、肥皂工业等，也不得不暂时缩小生产或转业。还有某些企业需要切实改变他们的产品为适合农民的用品，才能扩大销路。又由于投机事业的停止，社会已有很大数量的游资要求投放于生产事业。从根本观点上看来，无疑问，这是一些好的现象。无疑问，这又是要产生一些痛苦的。缩小生产、停工、转业，不可避免地要产生一些失业或者改行。现在已有人问：我愿转业，但转到何处去？请人民政府告诉我，什么事业可以办？这个问题是提得对的。要具体确切地答复每一个这样的问题，须要经过具体的调查研究，我现在只能作一般的大体方向的答复。这就是说，凡适当地服务于人民的需要，特别是适当地服务于农民的需要，而国家现在又不能办，或虽然办了但还很少的事业，是可以办的。交通运输事业以及服务于国家经济重点恢复部门的事业，医药事业，也是可以办的。此外，还有某些特殊矿产的开采与提炼，某些特殊工厂的建立，某些电力站的安建等，国家都可以在适当的条件之下，与私人订立合同，允许私人办理。现在人民政府还没有禁止私人创办任何不是操纵国计民生而是有益于国计民生的事业，所以私人事业的活动范围是很广大的。国家企业与私人生产事业之间的某些不适当的竞争现象，以及在定货中在加工中的某些不适当的条件，在调整工商业的工作中应该加以改正。劳资关系也可以在国家劳动法令、集体合同及劳资协商机构中纳入正轨。所以，私人资本不是没有出路的。当然，应该是老老实实地、不怕花费一些资本和气力地去经营那些确实于国计民生有利的事业。对于老老实实不怕花费一些资本和气力去经营生产的事业家，人民政府应当给予他们以各项必要的便利条件，并给以指导，使其避免盲目性，帮助其事业的成功。
    四、救济灾民，救济失业工人。
    经过人民政府及广大人民的努力运输，我们今年的粮食情况，可以确定的说：是有保障的了。现在离开麦收只有四十来天，目前正是救灾的紧要关头，因此，各地救灾人员不要保留，而要放手地把政府拨到各地的救灾粮在灾民生产自救的方针下迅速发放，以便使灾民渡过难关。由于人民自己的努力和人民政府的大规模组织工作，今年的灾荒已经确定地可以渡过，而不要外国一粒粮食的救济。美国帝国主义者在帮助蒋介石匪帮杀死了几百万中国人以后，忽然又装作慈善家的面孔，说是要求救济我们这里的灾民。他们所谓救灾的目的，就是要到中国的灾民中来进行破坏活动。中国人民虽然欢迎那些确属善意的国外帮助，但是对于帝国主义者的“好意”，我们已经领教得够多了，我们不需要这些人来进行破坏活动。
    既然某些经济事业的缩小、停工和转业是不可避免的，在各大城市中，在可能范围内，救济失业工人就是完全必要的，不容缓办的。中央人民政府已经决定拨出一批粮食和经费，同时也要求工商业家和在业工人拿出一部分钱来，作为救济失业工人的基金。中央人民政府劳动部正在起草救济失业工人的办法，并准备在各大城市成立失业工人救济处和职业介绍所。在中央的办法尚未发布以前，上海及其他若干城市，可以而且应该实行一种临时的救济。从来中国的政府是不救济失业工人的，而人民政府虽然今天还处在困难之中，对于失业工人就要规定并实行确实救济的办法。
            五、今后的土地改革。
    在今年秋后，在那些业已准备好了的新解放区，应该实行土地改革，但这种地区不应该太广。在战争已经基本上胜利的情况下，我们认为在今后的土地改革中，应该只没收地主的土地和许多公地，分配给无地少地的农民，同样也分给地主一份，而不动富农的土地和财产。对于地主的其他财产，除开农民必需的一部分生产资料外，也不予没收分配。关于这些问题，新的土地法令将要加以规定。鉴于过去的经验，我们认为在今后实行土地改革，应该完全是有领导的，有准备的，有秩序的，不能容许混乱现象的发生。因此，我们就不能急于要求完成一切新解放区的土地改革，而必须分为几个步骤，分期分区地去完成土地改革。如果能够在今后三年内基本上完成全国的土地改革，那就算是很快的了，就是一个很大的胜利。
    六、认真地纠正缺点、错误，整训干部。
    在去年四月二十日人民解放军各路野战军开始向南方和西北进军以来，在极短的时间内，即已解放除西藏以外的全部中国大陆包括有三万万以上人口的地区。我们占领的地区是这样大，各项工作极其繁重而复杂，有经验的干部不足，大批的新干部吸收进来，加上没有时间进行整训，因而在工作中伴着伟大成绩而俱来的，就是发生了许多缺点和错误。我们必须全面地看问题，工作的成绩和工作中的缺点错误，干部的艰苦努力和干部中发生的毛病，我们都应当看到，而不可对于任何一方面估计不足。现在全国人民都称赞我们的成绩，但同时要求我们改正已经发生的缺点错误，我们就应当正视这些缺点错误，并加以改正。中共中央已经做出了决定，要展开批评和自我批评，并要整训工作干部。在进行了这些步骤以后，我们相信，我们的缺点错误是可以改正过来的。
    错误中最严重的是命令主义的错误。我们有相当多的一些干部，他们也是为了完成国家和党给予他们的任务而斗争，这是好的，但是他们不讲究执行国家的和党的政策。他们不是在严格遵循国家的和党的政策的限度内去完成国家和党给予他们的任务，而是采取一种粗暴的方法去进行工作，不去注意具体的情况，不顾及事实上是否可能，不肯虚心地和当地人民商量，只是简单地去完成任务，结果，任务是完成了，人民却受到了本来可以避免的损失。这种命令主义作风，在征粮、税收和推销公债等项工作中已经表现得相当严重，已经引起许多人不满，如不加以纠正，我们就会脱离群众。不久以后，我们就要在广大的地区内进行土地改革，如不争取时间整训干部，土地改革工作也就难于做好。
    关于我们干部中这种命令主义的错误作风，中共中央历年都有指示，着重纠正，但是，即令在多次纠正之后，又可以发生。现在共产党有了四百多万党员，其中有将近二百万人只有两年半、两年、一年或者几个月的党龄。在政府机构中，在最近一年多中接收了大批的旧人员从事工作。在这种完全新的情况下，就要求我们立即开始进行一次大规模的整训工作，首行是整训干部的工作。主要的是总结工作，纠正命令主义的作风，其次是纠正其他的错误和缺点。
    同志们！如果我们的工作作风更好一些，我们的缺点错误更少一些，我们的工作作得更好一些，那末，我们就能更好地团结全中国的人民，就能更高地鼓舞全国人民的热情，就能增加人民更大的力量，就能使我们的国家和人民更快地渡过目前的困难和创造美好的将来。而这一切，就正是我们在庆祝今年五一劳动节的时候所要求达到的目的。
    伟大的五一劳动节——全中国与全世界劳动人民团结的节日万岁！
    全中国各民族各民主阶级各民主党派各人民团体的团结合作万岁！
