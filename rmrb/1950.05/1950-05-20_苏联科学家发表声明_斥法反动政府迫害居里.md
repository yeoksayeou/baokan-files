Xinhua News Agency, 19th: TASS reports: Prominent Soviet scientists have issued a statement defending Joliot-Curie regarding the French government's removal of him from the position of High Commissioner for Atomic Energy. The statement condemns the French government's dismissal of him as an act to appease warmongers. The statement continues: "The warmongers' demand to replace Joliot-Curie once again demonstrates their rejection of any plan to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes. Scientists who are committed to the victory of life are unacceptable to them. They only allow those who dare to turn science into an arsenal for manufacturing deadly weapons for new wars to approach nuclear reactors." The statement concludes: "No terror tactics of the warmongers can alter the victory of the great cause of peace and democracy."

The statement was signed by V. Vavilov, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Vice Presidents Bardin and Volgin, First Secretary of the Academy Topchiev, numerous academicians, and Sokolov, the director of the Mathematics and Physics Department of Moscow State University, among others.

Scientists of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, led by Vavilov and Petrovsky, who attended the meeting of the Department of Physics and Mathematics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences on May 15, sent a telegram to Joliot-Curie himself, expressing their respect and stating that they stand with all progressive humanity in defending this selfless scientist and heroic fighter for peace.

　　苏联科学家发表声明
　　斥法反动政府迫害居里
    【新华社十九日讯】综合塔斯社消息：苏联著名科学家就法国政府解除约里奥——居里原子能高级专员的职务一事，发表保卫约里奥——居里的声明。声明斥责法国政府解除他的职务，是为了讨好战争挑拨者。声明继称：“战争贩子要求撤换约里奥——居里，这样就再度表明了他们摈弃任何使原子能用于和平目的的计划。以生命之胜利为己任的科学家，是他们所不能接受的。他们只允许那些敢把科学变成为新战争制造致命武器的兵工厂的人们，来接近原子堆。”声明最后指出：战争贩子的任何恐怖手段，都不能改变伟大的和平与民主事业的胜利。
    在声明书上签名的有苏联科学院院长瓦维洛夫、副院长巴尔丁与沃尔金、科学院第一秘书托普契夫、科学院士多名及国立莫斯科大学数理系主任索科洛夫等人。
    出席苏联科学院物理数学部五月十五日会议的以瓦维洛夫和彼特罗夫斯基等为首的苏联科学家，曾致电约里奥——居里本人，表示致意，并且表示与整个进步人类同声保卫这位忘我的科学家与英勇的和平斗士。
