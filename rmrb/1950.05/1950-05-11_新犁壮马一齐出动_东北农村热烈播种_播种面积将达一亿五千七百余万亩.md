　　New Ploughs and Strong Horses Move Out Together
　　Enthusiastic Spring Planting in Northeast China
　　Planting Area to Reach Over 157 Million Mu
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 9th] After completing wheat planting, the vast rural areas of Northeast China have now fully shifted to planting major crops such as soybeans, sorghum, and millet. This spring, most areas of Northeast China have had favorable rainfall, and farmers are extremely enthusiastic about spring planting. It is estimated that this year's planting area will expand to over 157,560,000 mu, an increase of over 4,640,000 mu compared to last year, reaching more than 83% of the highest planting area during the puppet Manchukuo period in 1944. In the fertile Nenjiang and Songhua River basins, dozens of counties began planting successively after widespread spring rains last month. New ploughs and strong horses are moving out together, and no one is idle in the villages and households. In Songjiang Province, except for mountainous areas, nine counties have rapidly planted over 500,000 mu of soybeans and other crops. In Heilongjiang Province, the main grain-producing area of Northeast China, under the slogan of "timely, good, and extensive planting," the vast number of farmers have been drawn into a planting frenzy. Generally, counties have now completed 20% of their planting plans, and the southern mountainous areas have finished planting millet. Many counties and districts are also simultaneously engaged in land reclamation, having already completed 80% of their plans. This year, thousands of improved agricultural tools and some mechanical agricultural tools are being used in cultivation throughout the province, resulting in high efficiency. The warmer Changbai Mountain area and coastal areas started planting earlier, and most counties are about to complete their planting work. In Yingkou and Zhuanghe counties of Liaodong Province, while finishing planting ahead of schedule, preparations are already underway for summer weeding. In the severely affected areas of Liaoxi and Rehe provinces, most fields have been planted with early-maturing crops. In southern Rehe Province, the spring wheat is lush and covers the ridges, and the farmers are filled with joy.

　　新犁壮马一齐出动
　　东北农村热烈播种
　　播种面积将达一亿五千七百余万亩
    【新华社沈阳九日电】东北广大农村在种完小麦后，现已全面转入播种大豆、高粱、谷子等主要作物。今春东北大部地区雨水调匀，农民春耕播种热情极高，估计今年播种面积将扩大到一万万五千七百五十六万余亩，比去年增加四百六十四万余亩，即达到一九四四年伪满最高播种面积的百分之八十三以上。沃野千里的嫩江和松花江流域，上月普降春雨后，即有数十个县相继播种。新犁壮马一齐出动，村村户户没有闲人。松江省省内除山区以外，已有九个县迅速种完大豆等作物五十余万亩。东北主要产粮区的黑龙江省，在“适时、种好、多种”的口号下，广大农民均卷入了播种热潮。一般县份现已完成播种计划百分之二十，南部山区已种完谷子。许多县区还同时进行开荒，已经完成计划的百分之八十。全省今年有数千台改良农具及若干机械农具使用于耕作，效率甚高。气候较暖的长白山区及沿海地带则播种更早，大部县份即将结束播种工作。辽东省营口、庄河等县与提前结束播种同时，即开始准备夏锄事宜。辽西、热河省重灾区大部田地已播种早熟作物，热河省南部的春麦苍郁覆垅，农民喜气洋洋。
