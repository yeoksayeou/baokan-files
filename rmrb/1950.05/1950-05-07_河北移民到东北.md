Hebei Immigrants to the Northeast
    Pei Lan
    "Peasants all over the world are one family!" The fact that Hebei Province is planning to move a large number of immigrants to the Northeast once again proves this truth.
    During the Kuomintang bandit gang's rule, Hebei Province suffered from floods year after year. The Kuomintang bureaucratic ruling institutions treated the disaster victims by allowing them to flee blindly, resulting in large numbers of starvation deaths. Last year, Hebei Province suffered another serious flood. The People's Government handled the disaster problem with an extremely serious and responsible attitude. In addition to vigorously leading the disaster victims to produce and help themselves, it also organized the disaster victims to move to the Northeast in an organized and planned way. Starting from October last year, people's governments at all levels in Hebei Province established immigration offices, and relevant counties successively established immigration committees to handle immigration work. The main target of immigration is disaster victims in severely affected areas who cannot engage in farming within two or three years.
    By the time the last immigrant train departed on December 26, a total of more than 14,000 disaster victims from disaster areas in Tianjin City and Tianjin Prefecture, Tangshan Prefecture, and Baoding Prefecture in Hebei had moved to the Northeast, and were respectively resettled in Nehe and Gannan counties in Heilongjiang Province and Yanshou and Mishan counties in Songjiang Province. Such a large-scale, organized, and planned immigration is the first in Chinese history.
    The immigration work in Hebei is generally successful. At the beginning of the immigration, the responsible comrades in some counties in Hebei Province did not pay enough attention to this work. Some county heads considered it an "extra burden"; when some counties encountered difficulties in the immigration work, the responsible comrades did not overcome these difficulties but withdrew the cadres who were doing immigration work to do other work. The Provincial Immigration Office then formulated specific measures to correct these ideas of neglecting immigration work. Some leading cadres once believed that as long as the number of immigrants was assigned and the disaster victims were informed, the disaster victims would go by themselves. But the actual situation was not like this. The disaster victims had many concerns: for example, they were afraid of the cold in the Northeast, afraid of not adapting to the soil and water, afraid of being unfamiliar with the place and being bullied, afraid of going to work as coolies, and so on. Many people were also reluctant to leave their old homes, their houses, and furniture. After the leading cadres of various counties understood these situations, they sent special personnel to the disaster areas to carry out in-depth mobilization, explaining the favorable conditions for going to the Northeast, and explaining that all people under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, regardless of distance, are one family. This sincere and caring attitude deeply moved the disaster victims. Wuqing County also adopted the method of mobilizing party members and cadres to lead the disaster victims to move. Wuqing, Changli, and other counties mobilized the masses in various villages to purchase the disaster victims' belongings with a spirit of mutual assistance and friendship. The houses and land of the immigrants were either entrusted to relatives and friends or kept by the farmers' association. The wheat in the immigrants' fields was either agreed to be harvested by the collectors in the future and the money sent back, or the managers paid the money for wheat seeds and fertilizers in advance; in some places, the cooperatives fairly and reasonably purchased the disaster victims' belongings that could not be taken away. In this way, some of the disaster victims' concerns were quickly eliminated. When the disaster victims were about to leave, various places held farewell parties, helped them move their belongings onto the train, and raised travel expenses for them. Each street in Yangcun Town, Wuqing County, organized a handling team to help the disaster victims move their belongings, and each street automatically raised more than 200,000 yuan and other items to help the disaster victims. The four carts of the town's cart union automatically sent things to the station for the disaster victims. The disaster victims said with emotion: "When we arrive in the Northeast, we must work hard to produce and repay the government and our folks for their care for us." Some said: "This is really the people's government. Who would care if you starved to death during the Kuomintang era!"
    On the road, the immigrants were divided into brigades and detachments, led separately by the original district and village cadres. There were also doctors on the train to take care of everyone's health. The first batch of 1,559 disaster victims was personally led by Zhang Zhenyu, Director of the Hebei Provincial Department of Agriculture, all the way to Nehe in the Northeast. The immigrants who arrived first wrote letters to their hometowns, reporting the comfortable life situation, which gave the people who went later more confidence and courage.
    The people's governments in various parts of the Northeast made careful plans for the immigration work in advance. Based on conditions such as land, population, and mass base, the areas for resettlement of immigrants were determined. The Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government established immigration stations and immigration committees in Harbin, Qiqihar, Suihua, and other places to solve the immigrants' food and accommodation problems; the counties prepared houses, carts, leather clothes, cotton clothes, firewood, charcoal, and other items in advance. The old village head of Dongliumao River in Huanan County received the task of accepting immigrants from the district and immediately convened a village meeting to discuss it. As soon as he finished talking about this matter, people clamored: "We are all of the same class, if we have food, we can't let them have difficulties. I'll free up a heated kang!" "It's not easy for one person to help ten people, but it's easy for ten people to help one person. I'll help with thirty catties of rice!..." Women cadres and folks busied themselves pasting windows, building pot tables, repairing kangs, and tidying up houses for the immigrants. Some places also made preliminary production plans for the immigrants and plans for arranging children to enroll in school.
    As soon as the immigrants got off the train, teams of carts from various counties came to greet them. The magistrate and county party committee of Qing'an County received the notice of the immigrants' arrival on the evening of December 24 and rushed to the station overnight to resettle the immigrants. As soon as the immigrants arrived in Mishan County, Songjiang Province, special personnel helped them take things, hold children, and carry old ladies on stretchers to the prepared residences. The magistrate of Mishan County kindly told the immigrants: "When everyone comes here, we guarantee that there will be no difficulties in this year's life and next year's production." The immigrants got on the carts and arrived in the village, and the local peasant brothers immediately swarmed up to help carry things. Cadres and folks in various townships got up to make fire and cook for the immigrants. In the family of Sun Jingdi, who lived in Liu Maohe Village, Huanan, a woman gave birth to a child. The old lady Sun took care of the parturient as if she were her own daughter, cooking millet porridge, making noodles, and pouring eggs for the parturient to eat.
    With the help of the governments and masses in various parts of the Northeast, the immigrants were organized into groups of nine households, and each group was given six horses, a plow, and a cart; each person was allocated an average of one to two hectares of land (each hectare can harvest four to five shi to seven to eight shi of grain), and each hectare was given one hundred catties of seeds; each person was also given enough food to eat for eight to ten months. The immigrants said excitedly: "This time we have moved from a chaff bin to a grain bin. We must work hard to produce and repay the government's kindness! At the same time, as long as we work hard, we will surely be able to become rich in three to five years!"

　　河北移民到东北
    培蓝
    “天下农民是一家!”这次河北省有计划地大批移民到东北的事实，再一次证明了这个真理。
    河北省在国民党匪帮统治时期，曾经连年闹水灾。国民党官僚统治机构对待灾民的办法是任令他们盲目逃荒，以至大批地饿死。去年河北省又遭受了严重的水灾。人民政府则以极端严肃负责的态度处理灾荒问题，除了大力领导灾民生产自救外，并有组织有计划地组织灾民向东北迁移。从去年十月开始，河北省各级人民政府成立了移民办事处，有关各县陆续成立了移民委员会，专门办理移民工作。移民的主要对象是两三年里不能脱水耕种的重灾区的灾民。
    到十二月二十六日开出末次移民火车为止，从天津市及天津专区、唐山专区、保定专区等地灾区，共有一万四千余灾民移往东北；分别安置于黑龙江省的讷河、甘南及松江省的延寿、密山等县。这样大规模的有组织有计划的移民，在中国历史上还是第一次。
    河北的移民工作一般是有成绩的。移民开始时，河北省有些县的负责同志对这一工作还不够注意。有的县长认为这是“额外负担”；有些县在移民工作中碰到一些困难，负责同志不去克服这些困难却把正在作移民工作的干部抽回作别的工作。省移民办事处遂定出具体办法，纠正了这些忽视移民工作的思想。有些领导干部曾经认为只要把移民的数目字分配一下，告诉灾民，灾民自己就会去的。但实际情形并非如此。灾民曾有许多顾虑：例如怕东北冷，怕不服水土，怕人地生疏受欺负，怕去了做苦工等等。还有许多人舍不得老家，舍不得房屋、家具，各县领导干部了解了这些情况，就抽出专人赴灾区进行深入动员，说明到东北去的有利条件，说明凡是共产党和人民政府领导下的人民，不分地区远近，都是一家。这种真诚关心的态度使灾民们深为感动。武清县并采用了发动党员干部带领灾民迁移的办法。武清、昌黎等县则发动各村群众以互助友爱的精神购买灾民的东西。移民们的房屋、土地有的靠给亲友，有的靠给农会保管。移民地里的麦子，有的约定将来由代收户收割后给变卖寄款，有的由经管者事先偿付麦种、肥料钱；有的地方由合作社公平合理地收购灾民不能带走的财物。这样，灾民的一些顾虑很快就消除了。灾民临走时，各地开欢送会，帮他们搬东西上火车，为他们募集路费。武清县杨村镇各街组织了搬运小组，帮助灾民搬东西，各街自动募集了二十多万元及其他物品帮助灾民。该镇大车工会的四辆大车，自动给灾民往车站上送东西。灾民们感动地说：“我们到了东北，一定要好好生产，回答政府和乡亲们对我们的关心。”有的说：“这真是人民的政府，国民党时你饿死谁管呀！”
    在路上，移民们分成大队、分队，由原区村干部分别领导。并有医生在车上照顾大家的康健。首批灾民一千五百五十九人，由河北省农业厅张振宇厅长亲自率领，直到东北讷河。先到的移民纷纷往原籍写信，报告生活安适的情况，使以后去的人更有了信心和勇气。
    东北各地人民政府事先对移民工作作了周密的计划。依据土地、人口及群众基础等条件，决定了安置移民的地区。黑龙江省人民政府在哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、绥化等地设立了移民站和移民委员会解决移民的食宿问题；各县事先准备了房子、大车、皮衣、棉衣、柴炭等物。桦南县东柳毛河的老村长从区上领受了接受移民任务，回村立即召开村民大会讨论。他把这件事刚一讲完，人们就嚷嚷开了：“都是一个阶级的，咱们有吃的，就不能让他们困难着。我腾出一铺炕！”“一个人帮十个人不好帮，十个人帮一个人好办。我帮助三十斤米！…”妇女干部和老乡们张罗着给移民糊窗户、搭锅台、修理炕、收拾房子。有些地方还替移民作了初步生产计划和安置儿童入学的计划。
    移民一下火车，就有各县成队的大车来迎接。庆安县长、县委于十二月二十四日晚上接到移民到达的通知，连夜赶到车站，安置移民。移民们到达松江省密山县，刚一下车，就有专人帮助拿东西、抱小孩、用担架抬老太太，送到早已准备好的住处。密山县长亲切的告诉移民们说：“大伙来到这里，保证今年生活和来年生产不发生困难。”移民们坐上大车到了村里，当地的农民弟兄们立即一拥而上，代搬东西。各乡干部和老乡们都起来给移民生火做饭。住在桦南柳毛河村孙景第家的移民，有个女人生了孩子。孙老太太像照顾自己的亲女儿一样，熬小米粥，做面条，冲鸡蛋给产妇吃。
    在东北各地政府与群众的帮助下，移民每九户编成一个小组，每组发给了六匹大马，一张开荒洋犁，一个大车；每人平均分给一、二垧地（每垧地能收四、五石至七、八石粮），每垧地发给一百斤籽种；每人并发给可吃八个月到十个月的食粮。移民们都兴奋地说：“这回我们算由糠囤搬到粮食囤了。一定要努力生产，来报答人民政府的恩典！同时只要好好劳动，三五年也一定能发家致富！”
