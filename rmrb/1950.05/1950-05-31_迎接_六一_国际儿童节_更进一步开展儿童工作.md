　　Child care and education have received close attention from the state in New China. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, in its Chapter V, in addition to generally stipulating cultural and educational policies including children's education, specifically stipulates in Article 48, "Attention should be paid to protecting the health of mothers, infants, and children." The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China also takes the protection of children's interests as one of the basic principles of legislation.
    Under the guidance of this spirit, children's welfare work in New China has developed rapidly. First, looking at the child care industry, according to incomplete statistics, as of May 1950, there were 541 public and private child care institutions in 27 major provinces and cities across the country, with approximately 35,000 children in care, an increase of threefold compared to October 1949. Before liberation, Beijing had only nine nurseries; now it has increased to fifty-four, six times the previous number. Among these nurseries, factory nurseries account for a large proportion. For example, of the 112 nurseries in Shanghai, factory nurseries account for 56; of the 25 nurseries in Tianjin, factory nurseries account for 12. The rapid increase in nurseries indicates the increase in mothers participating in production and other work after liberation. The increase in factory nurseries indicates the improvement of welfare services for working women in industry.
    Secondly, in terms of children's education, there are currently approximately 300,000 primary schools nationwide, with over 20 million children enrolled. In some areas, the number of children enrolled has greatly increased compared to before liberation. For example, there are currently over 3.77 million primary school students in the Northeast region, an increase of 48 percent compared to the 2.54 million during the Japanese occupation; there are currently over 2.33 million primary school students in Hebei Province, an increase of 89 percent compared to the 1.23 million in 1936. Moreover, the composition of enrolled children has begun to undergo fundamental changes. In the old liberated areas, the children of the working people have accounted for the majority of enrolled children. For example, in the Northeast Administrative Region, the children of workers, hired peasants, poor peasants, middle peasants, and other urban working people have accounted for 81.3 percent of all enrolled children; another example is the statistics from Lin County in Pingyuan Province, where the children of middle, poor, and hired peasants have accounted for 94 percent of all enrolled children.
    Thirdly, the Chinese Young Pioneers, established last October, has developed rapidly in the past half year. According to incomplete statistics, there are currently over 478,000 Young Pioneers members.
    The above situations illustrate that the children's care and education cause in New China has not only greatly developed in quantity, but also changed the situation in old China where only a few children enjoyed the right to care and education, making the care and education cause serve the children of the broad masses of working people. This is a major reform. Through the education of these nurseries, primary schools, and Young Pioneers, New China is constantly producing many healthy and well-rounded children. This achievement is significant, and it is inseparable from the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the support and care of the People's Government, the assistance and cooperation of women's organizations, youth organizations, and workers' organizations, and especially the hard work of children's workers. As we commemorate the first "June 1st" International Children's Day, we should express our respect and gratitude to children's workers across the country.
    However, we must recognize that the children's care and education cause in New China is only just beginning. To do a good job in children's care and education throughout China requires long-term, great, and arduous efforts. In order to further develop children's work, we have the following hopes for children's workers across the country.
    First, children's workers should recognize that children are the masters of the future, the future builders of New China, and that children's care and education work is an important task related to national health and the construction of New China. Especially in the current China, a country that has suffered long-term rule and destruction by the Kuomintang reactionaries, the poverty, ignorance, unsanitary conditions, and various disasters left to us by old China still require long-term struggle to be fundamentally eliminated. Many children in New China are still living in difficult conditions, many children have not received the nutrition and reasonable care they deserve, and many children have not had the opportunity to attend school. Solving these problems is the serious task before us. Therefore, in addition to our government taking various measures to further care for and support the children's care and education cause, all relevant aspects of society should provide more assistance and promotion to this cause, parents should be more enthusiastic in supporting and supporting it, and we especially hope that our children's workers should fully recognize the importance of children's work, wholeheartedly serve children, assist the government in overcoming difficulties, and restore and develop children's care and education as much as possible. We should encourage enthusiastic people in society to donate funds to establish various nurseries, kindergartens, and primary schools, and promote the development of the children's care and education cause from all aspects.
    We believe that as the economic construction cause of New China steadily moves forward, the high tide of cultural construction will gradually arrive, and the children's care and education cause will inevitably gradually develop on an increasingly large scale. We must have sufficient understanding of this great prospect.
    Second, children's workers should strive to protect and develop the physical health of children, and guide children to learn to love the motherland, love the people, love labor, love science, and cherish public property. Our childcare workers, primary school teachers, maternal and child health workers, parents, and all enthusiastic people involved in children's work should all focus on this goal, and carry out childcare and education work step by step and with focus according to the different situations of children in various places. Children are the spring of life, and good seeds must be sown in this spring, appropriate irrigation must be carried out, and extra care and cultivation must be given, so that when children grow up, they can become successors and promoters of the great people's revolution and the construction of New China.
    Third, in order to achieve the above goals, our children's workers must study well, study the basic knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, study the New Democratic educational and childcare policies, learn new working methods; and must constantly transform their own thinking, establish new working attitudes, and wholeheartedly serve the people and children; we must learn scientific professional knowledge, do our work well, improve our work, and improve our work according to the needs of the country and possible conditions. Let us learn from the spirit of the famous Soviet rural female teacher Vasilyevna, treat children's work as our own glorious revolutionary cause, and use our own efforts to promote the development of children's care and education cause from all aspects.

### 迎接“六一”国际儿童节  更进一步开展儿童工作

　　迎接“六一”国际儿童节  更进一步开展儿童工作
    儿童保育和儿童教育事业，在新中国受到国家密切的注意。人民政治协商会议共同纲领第五章，除一般地规定了包含儿童教育在内的文化教育政策以外，在第四十八条中特别规定了“注意保护母亲，婴儿和儿童的健康”。中华人民共和国婚姻法，也以保护儿童利益作为立法基本原则之一。
    在这种精神指导之下，新中国的儿童福利工作，得到了迅速的发展。首先就儿童保育事业来看，据不完全的统计，截至一九五○年五月止，全国二十七个重要省市共有公私立托儿机关五四一处，受托儿童约三万五千名，较一九四九年十月增加了三倍。北京市解放前仅有托儿所九处，现已增至五十四处，为过去的六倍。在上述这些托儿所中，工厂托儿所占了很大的比例，例如，上海现有的一一二处托儿所中，工厂托儿所占五十六处，天津现有的二十五处托儿所中，工厂托儿所占十二处。托儿所的迅速增加，表示母亲们在解放以后参加生产及其他工作的增加。工厂托儿所的增加，表示在工业中的劳动妇女的福利事业的增进。
    其次，在儿童教育事业方面，目前全国约有小学三十万所，入学儿童二千余万人。有些地区，入学儿童的数目已较解放前大大增加。例如目前东北地区有小学生三百七十七万余人，较日本占领时期的二百五十四万余人，增加了百分之四十八；河北省现有小学生人数有二百三十三万余人，较一九三六年的一百二十三万余人增加了百分之八十九。不仅如此，在入学儿童的成份上，已开始发生基本的变化。在老解放区劳动人民的子女在入学儿童中已占了多数，例如在东北行政区，工人、雇农、贫农、中农以及其他城市劳动人民的子女已占全体入学儿童的百分之八一点三；又如平原省林县的统计，中、贫、雇农的子女已占全体入学儿童的百分之九十四。
    第三，去年十月成立的中国少年儿童队，在大半年中有了迅速的发展。根据不完全的统计，现已有少年儿童队队员四十七万八千余人。
    以上这些情况说明了新中国的儿童保教事业，不仅在数量上有了很大发展，而且改变了旧中国的仅由少数儿童享受保教权利的情况，使保教事业为广大劳动人民的子女服务。这是一个重大的改革。经过了这些托儿所、小学和少年儿童队的教育，新中国正在不断地出现许多身心健康的好儿童。这种成绩是很大的，这种成绩的由来，是与中国共产党的领导，人民政府的扶持与关怀，妇女团体、青年团体和工人团体的协助与配合、特别是与儿童工作者辛勤的努力分不开的。我们在纪念第一个“六一”国际儿童节的时候，应当对于全国儿童工作者表示敬意和慰问。
    但是，我们必须认识：新中国的儿童保教事业，现正还仅仅是一个开始，办好全中国的儿童保教工作，还须作长期的、伟大的、艰苦的努力。为了进一步开展儿童工作，我们对于全国的儿童工作者有以下的希望。
    第一，儿童工作者应当认识儿童是未来的主人，是新中国的未来的建设者，儿童保教工作，是有关民族健康和新中国建设事业的重要工作之一。特别在目前的中国，是经过国民党反动派长期统治与摧残的国家，旧中国遗留给我们的贫穷、愚昧、不卫生和各种灾害，还须经过长期奋斗才能根本扫除。新中国许多儿童还过着困苦的生活，有很多的儿童还没有得到应有的营养和合理的保育，有很多儿童还没有获得入学的机会。解决这些问题，这就是摆在我们面前的严重的任务。因此，除掉我们的政府正在采取各种措施更加关怀和扶持儿童保教事业之外，社会有关的各方面对于这一事业应更多地协助和提倡，父母们应当更加热心赞助和支持，特别希望我们儿童工作者应该充分认识儿童工作的重要性，全心全意为儿童服务，协助政府克服困难，尽可能恢复和发展儿童保教事业，鼓励社会热心人士，捐资兴办各种托儿所、幼稚园和小学校等，从各个方面推进儿童保教事业的开展。
    我们相信，随着新中国经济建设事业的稳步前进，文化建设的高潮将逐步到来，儿童保教事业也必然要逐步地规模日益壮大地发展。对于这种伟大的远景，要有足够的认识。
    第二，儿童工作者应当努力保护和发展儿童身体的健康，并引导儿童学会爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物。我们的保育工作者们、小学教师们、妇婴卫生工作者们、父母们以及一切有关儿童工作的热心人士们，都应该围绕这一个目标，根据各地儿童不同的情况，有步骤、有重点地进行保教工作。儿童是人生的春天，必须在这个春天，播下良好的种子，进行适当的灌溉，加倍地爱护和培育，使儿童将来长大成人的时候，就能成为伟大的人民革命和新中国建设事业的继承者和发扬光大者。
    第三，为着达到上述目的，我们儿童工作者，必须很好的学习，学习马列主义的基本知识，研究新民主主义的教育和保育的方针、政策，学习新的工作方法；并且要不断改造自己的思想，树立新的工作态度，全心全意为人民为儿童服务；要学习科学的业务知识，根据国家的需要与可能的条件，作好工作，改进工作，提高工作。让我们学习著名的苏联乡村女教师华西里耶夫娜的精神，把儿童工作当成自己光荣的革命事业，用自己的努力来从各方面推进儿童保育和儿童教育事业的开展。
