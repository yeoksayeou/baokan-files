The Jingxi Coal Mine Company's Five Mines
    Launch an Anti-Overseer System Movement
    Extremely Sinister Foremen and Contractors Have Been Handed Over to the Court for Trial
    [Our dispatch] The Five Mines affiliated with the Jingxi Coal Mine Company are currently enthusiastically carrying out an anti-feudal overseer system movement. The Mentougou Mine Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Jingxi Coal Mine Company, and the Municipal Coal Mine Trade Union have formed an anti-overseer system work committee. Each mine, under the leadership of the Management Committee Standing Committee, has formed a work group to lead the thorough elimination of the remnants of the feudal overseer system and establish a democratic mine management system.
    Prior to the launch of this movement, each mine trained activists to serve as the backbone of the movement. Extensive publicity and education were conducted among the workers to arouse their hatred for the contractors and foremen. On May 19th, the mine convened a meeting of foremen and those employed by them. Dozens of worker representatives participated. At the meeting, representatives of the Jingxi Coal Mine Company formally announced the removal of Zhang Zhenkai and 15 other foremen from their administrative management positions. The district government and the court accepted the workers' accusations against Zhang Zhenkai and others, and on the spot, detained Zhang Zhenkai, a major foreman guilty of heinous crimes for supporting five major contractors and exploiting and oppressing workers for more than twenty years, for trial. (According to many veteran workers, Zhang Zhenkai had close ties with local military, government, and secret service personnel during the enemy and puppet regime and is still privately hiding firearms.) Other foremen and their employees (investigators, accountants) were dealt with separately according to the severity of their crimes, after listening to the opinions of the masses. Foremen who were from worker backgrounds, had production skills, and were not badly viewed by the workers were retained, transferred, or made to participate in labor. As for the major and second-level foremen, they were generally not dealt with. The workers said, "Arresting Zhang Zhenkai is equivalent to the second liberation of Mentougou."
    The purpose of this movement is to thoroughly eliminate the remaining overseer system and oppose the overseer style. In conjunction with this movement, unreasonable institutions are being reformed, such as abolishing the supervisor, large team leader (three shifts as a large team), and clerk systems. The system of each team (shift) as a production unit, with the coal mining team uniformly calculating work and materials, and wages paid by the cashier group, is implemented. The workers' representative meeting and the management committee are strengthened to implement a democratic management system and strengthen the unity of employees and improve production.

　　京西煤矿公司所属五矿
    展开反把头制运动         
    罪大恶极的包工大柜已交法院审讯
    【本报讯】京西煤矿公司所属五矿，现正热烈开展反封建把头制运动。中共门头矿委会、京西煤矿公司、市煤矿工会组成了反把头制工作委员会，各矿在管委会常委会领导下，组成工作组，领导彻底肃清封建把头残余，建立民主的矿山管理制度。
    在这一运动展开之先，各矿都调训了积极分子，作为这一运动中的骨干，在群众中进行了广泛的宣传教育，启发工友们对包工柜的仇恨。五月十九日，该矿召开了把头及把头雇用人员大会。工人推选代表数十人参加。会上，京西煤矿公司代表正式宣布撤消张振凯等十六名把头所担任的行政管理职务。区政府和法院接受了工友们对张振凯等的控诉，当场将罪大恶极支持五个包工大柜，剥削压迫工人二十几年的大把头张振凯扣押以便审讯。（据不少老工友反映，张振凯在敌伪时期与本地军政特务有密切勾结，现在还私藏枪支。）对其他把头及其雇用人员（查头子，司账），则听取群众意见，按其罪恶大小，分别处理。对于工人出身、有生产技术、工人反映不坏的把头，则留用、调用，或使其参加劳动。至于大头、二头，一般的不作处理。工人们说：“把张振凯逮捕了，等于门头沟第二次解放。”
    这次运动的目的，主要是彻底肃清残余的把头制度，和反对把头作风。并结合这一运动，对不合理的机构进行改革。如取消监工、大组长、（三班为一个大组）事务员等制度；实行以每一个小组（班）为生产单位，由采煤组统一计工计料，工资由出纳组开支，健全工人代表会与管理委员会，实行民主管理制度，加强职工团结，提高生产。（门头矿工报通讯组）
