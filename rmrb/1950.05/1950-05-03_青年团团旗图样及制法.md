Xinhua News Agency, 30th: The flag of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League has been decided by the Central Committee of the Youth League. The flag is red, symbolizing revolutionary victory. A yellow five-pointed star is placed in the upper left corner, surrounded by a yellow circle, symbolizing that the younger generation of Chinese youth is united around the Chinese Communist Party. The design and production method of the flag are announced as follows:

　　(1) The flag is rectangular, with a length-to-height ratio of three to two. A yellow five-pointed star is placed in the upper left corner of the flag, surrounded by a yellow circle.

　　(2) The position and production method of the five-pointed star and circle are as follows:

　　A. First, divide the flag surface into four equal rectangles, and then divide the upper left (the opposite side is the right) rectangle into twelve equal parts vertically.

　　B. Take the center point of the upper left rectangle as the center of the circle, and draw two circles with radii of three and four equal parts of the length. The area between the two circles is the yellow circle. Then, determine five equidistant points on the inner circumference, with one point located directly above the circumference. Connect the points which are separated by one intervening point to form straight lines. The outline of these five straight lines is the outer edge of the yellow five-pointed star.

　　(3) The general standard sizes of the flag are set as the following three, which can be selected as appropriate:

　　A. Length 288 cm, Height 192 cm

　　B. Length 192 cm, Height 128 cm

　　C. Length 96 cm, Height 64 cm
