　　Post Office Provides Inquiry and Person Search Services
    [Our Newspaper] The Beijing Postal Administration will add inquiry and person search registration services starting today. The methods are as follows:
    1. Regarding inquiries: The public can inquire with the Administration about postal matters and general unclear issues. For inquiries not related to postal affairs, matters related to telecommunications and railways, the addresses of various institutions, organizations, and schools in Beijing, the names and prices of books, newspapers, and magazines published in Beijing, and general commodity price information are temporarily the limits. As for other inquiries, we will also try our best to investigate and reply or introduce relevant parties to reply. Inquiry methods are divided into oral, telephone, and written communication. For inquiries not within the scope of postal services, please include sufficient postage when inquiring by mail. Return postage will be temporarily waived (but if registered mail is required, please include registered postage).
    2. Regarding person search registration: The purpose of handling this business is to help resolve the broken connections between revolutionary soldiers, cadres, and the masses with their families or relatives. The method is: Anyone in the public who wants to find relatives and friends can provide the most detailed description of the name, age, native place, original knowledge or hearsay location and work of the person being sought, in order to find clues and inquire on their behalf. Soldiers and cadres who have lost contact with their families or relatives and still wish to restore contact are welcome to register at the post office.
    The above inquiry and person search registration matters must be handled at the Social Service Section of the Beijing Postal Administration (telephone 5-4146) or the information service desk. When inquiring or registering by mail, the upper left corner of the envelope should be marked with "Inquiry" or "Registration" respectively, and sent directly to the Social Service Section of the Beijing Postal Administration. In order to serve the people, the post office will temporarily not charge any fees for handling the above matters, and plans to promote them further when they are effective.
