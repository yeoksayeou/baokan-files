　　My Self-Criticism
　　Fang Ji

　　Editor's Note: After this newspaper's "People's Garden" criticized Comrade Fang Ji's novel "Let Life Become More Beautiful" on March 12th, Comrade Fang Ji sent a letter on April 10th containing some self-criticism. Below is an excerpt from Comrade Fang Ji's letter.

　　I now believe that the errors I committed in this novel, besides being due to my low level of Marxism-Leninism and the unhealthy elements remaining in my thinking, are also because the subject matter and theme are inconsistent. My initial intention in writing this novel was to express the problem of anti-feudal thought in rural areas after the land reform, and this thought was most prominently manifested in marriage issues. Therefore, I chose the current theme and created the character of "Xiao Huan." In my understanding, I was portraying her as a kind of revolutionary thought with shortcomings, which then developed correctly under the leadership of the Party. At first, I certainly did not think of using the theme of joining the army to express this, and only in the middle of writing, in order to strengthen her "role" and also to avoid being the same as the previous few "discontinuous stories" (there were four previous ones), did I make her stand out on the issue of joining the army. In this way, it produced a distorted depiction of the woman's strength exceeding the Party's strength, and love exceeding politics. If I had not used the theme of joining the army, but had followed my original intention and let Xiao Huan expose the bad influence imposed on her by feudal rule at the meeting to struggle against the landlord—as I initially wrote about her—to oppose the direct enemy, then the situation would have been different. I did not start from the content first, but from the form (avoiding repetition), not making my protagonist directly oppose the feudal enemy, but instead opposing the influence of feudal thought imposed on the masses by the landlord class, and incorrectly using the theme of joining the army, thus putting myself in a difficult situation. When I abandoned the direct revolutionary enemy, dealt with two events that were both of revolutionary significance at the same time, and juxtaposed political mobilization and free love, and in order to "strengthen" the protagonist's character and complete its "development" (regarding this point, I have recently fully realized while revising the work that such a theme and character cannot be expressed in this subject matter: either completely avoid the story of joining the army, or if taking joining the army as the theme, it is necessary to change the protagonist's existing character. Because the issue of free love can only constitute contradiction and development in the anti-feudal struggle, and in the military service campaign it naturally becomes subordinate and secondary), I reversed reality, making the important subordinate to the secondary, making politics subordinate to love, and showing insufficient Party leadership, and exaggerating the role of love in life over politics. Thus, as a result, not only was the protagonist's character not completed, but it was weakened; not only was the political effect hindered, but the artistic effect was also hindered. This has made me further realize the inevitable unity of subject matter and theme, form and content, art and politics, and that the former must be subordinate to the latter.

　　我的检讨
    方纪
    编者按：三月十二日本报人民园地对方纪同志的小说《让生活变得更美好罢》进行批评后，方纪同志在四月十日来信有所检讨。下面是方纪同志来信的摘录。
    我现在认为，我在这篇小说中所犯的错误，除了由于马列主义水平低，思想上还残留着不健康的因素外，还因为题材和主题不一致。最初我写这篇小说的意图，是想表现土改后农村中的反封建思想问题，而这种思想最突出的便表现在婚姻问题上。因此我选择了现在的主题，并且创造了“小环”的性格。在我的认识里，我是把她当做一种有缺点的革命的思想来表现的，然后在党的领导下才得到正确的发展。开始我确乎没有想到用参军的题材来表现这一主题，写到中间，才为了加强她的“作用”，同时也为了避免和前面几篇“不连续的故事”（前面尚有四篇）写法雷同，才使她在参军问题上突出出来。这样一来，就产生了女人的力量超过党的力量，爱情超过政治的歪曲的描写。假如我不是使用参军的题材，而是按照我原来的意图，让小环在斗争地主的大会上去暴露封建统治所加于她身上的坏影响——如我开始所写在她身上的——去反对直接的敌人，那么情形就会两样了。我没有首先从内容出发，而从形式出发（避免雷同），不使自己的主人公去正面的反对封建敌人，而去反对地主阶级所加于群众身上的封建思想的影响，而且不正确地使用了参军的题材，这样，我就使自己陷于困难中了。当我抛开了直接的革命敌人，处理同时具有革命意义的两种事件，而把政治动员和自由恋爱并列，并为了“加强”主人公的性格，完成其“发展”（关于这一点，最近我在修改作品时，已完全体会到那样的主题和性格是不能在这一题材里表现的：或者完全不涉及参军的故事，或者以参军为主题，就必须改变主人公的现有性格。因为自由变爱问题在反封建斗争中才能构成矛盾和发展，在参军运动中当然就降为附属的、次要的了）时，便颠倒了现实，使重要的服从了次要的，使政治服从了爱情，而表现为党的领导不足，以及夸大爱情在生活中的作用超过政治了。这样，结果，不但没有完成主人公的性格，而且削弱了它；不但妨碍了政治效果，而且妨碍了艺术效果。这使我进一步认识了：题材和主题，形式和内容，艺术和政治的必然统一和前者必须服从后者。
