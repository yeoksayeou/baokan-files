　　Northeast Fuel Company Mudanjiang Branch
    Exceeds Coal Sales Target
    Cash Recovery Nearly Doubles Original Plan
    [Our Newspaper] The Mudanjiang Branch of the Northeast Fuel Company has exceeded its coal sales target for the first quarter. The company originally planned to sell 9,500 tons of coal in the first quarter, but actual sales by the end of March reached 17,766 tons, exceeding the target by 8,266 tons. Cash recovery amounted to 11.64 billion yuan (Northeast currency), exceeding the original plan of 6 billion by 94 percent.
    The reason for the company's success in sales is mainly due to: attaching importance to the cash recovery task assigned by the higher authorities, and changing the past sales methods. For example, two more salespersons were added (there were none in the past), to promote coal to residents and businesses in the streets, and the business operations were made more convenient for customers. In the past, coal sales were limited to office hours, and customers were not served after hours. Some residents would rather spend more money to buy firewood in the street than come to the coal plant to avoid trouble. In this quarter, the company first accepted the past experiences and changed the past office-style operation of sitting in the factory waiting for buyers. At the same time, for customers buying a ton or more of coal, the company was responsible for delivery (the company delivers, the buyer pays the freight). If the customer did not bring enough money, the delivery driver could bring it back. As a result, some residents inquired about coal prices and conveniently took the coal home with them.

　　东北燃料公司牡丹江分公司
    超额完成销煤任务     
    回笼现金超过原计划几达一倍
    【本报讯】东北燃料公司牡丹江分公司第一季售煤任务超额完成。该公司首季原订销煤九千五百吨，至三月底实际销售已达一万七千七百六十六吨，超过任务八千二百六十六吨；回笼现金一百十六亿四千万元（东北币、下同），超过原计划六十亿的百分之九十四。
    该公司推销工作之所以收到这种成绩，主要原因是：重视了上级所给的现金回笼任务，改变了过去推销办法。例如增添了两名推销员（过去没有），到街道市民家及各商号汇煤，并在经营上方便了主顾。过去卖煤光限于在办公时间内，过时不候，有的市民宁可在街里多花钱买柈子烧也不到煤厂来多找麻烦。在这一季度中首先接受了过去的经验，改变了过去坐在厂里等买主的营业机关化作风。同时凡买煤上吨的主顾，公司负责给送（公司送，车费由买主出），钱没带够时，可以由送煤车夫带回。因此，有的市民来打听煤价，顺便就把煤带回去了。（石光）
