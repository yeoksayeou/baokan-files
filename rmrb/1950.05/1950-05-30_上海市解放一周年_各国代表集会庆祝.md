Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 28th: May 27th marked the first anniversary of the liberation of Shanghai. On the evening of that day, over two thousand representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai held a grand celebration at the Shanghai Municipal Government Auditorium to commemorate this great festival of rebirth for the people of Shanghai and to celebrate the victories achieved by the people of Shanghai in their struggle to overcome difficulties over the past year. Soong Ching-ling, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government, attended the grand event. Soviet Consul in Shanghai, Mr. Vladmirov, and First Secretary of the Hungarian Legation, Mr. Fekete, were also invited to attend.

After Liu Changsheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, announced the opening of the meeting, Vice Chairman Zeng Shan of the East China Military and Political Committee delivered a speech. He pointed out that the liberation of Shanghai ushered in a new era in Shanghai's history. The long-term aggression of imperialism and the criminal rule of the Kuomintang reactionary government for more than twenty years had created a serious dependency in Shanghai's economy. Therefore, in its transformation into a new city serving the people, it encountered inevitable difficulties and pains. However, in the year since Shanghai's liberation, most of the difficulties have been overcome. The East China Military and Political Committee and the Shanghai Municipal People's Government will continue to unite people from all walks of life to fight to overcome the current temporary difficulties. Vice Chairman Zeng emphasized the issue of finance and economy. He said: The People's Government must not only develop state-owned enterprises and cooperatives, but also enable private enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood to achieve greater development under the leadership of state-owned enterprises, in order to achieve the goal of new democratic construction.

Subsequently, Vice Mayor Pan Hannian of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government delivered a report to the conference on the work of the Shanghai Municipal People's Government over the past year. In his report, Vice Mayor Pan pointed out that the people of Shanghai, under the leadership of the People's Government, have victoriously passed the most difficult year.

Next, Liu Hongsheng, Vice Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal People's Consultative Conference, spoke. He said: "In the past year, the people of Shanghai have politically turned over a new leaf. The policies of the People's Government everywhere demonstrate its determination to serve the people, which is completely different from the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits before liberation." He stated that representatives from all walks of life will resolutely use the method of labor-management consultation to maintain production, provide relief to unemployed workers, complete tax collection tasks, and pay off the remaining public bond debts, in practical actions to implement the spirit of the Third All-Circles People's Representative Conference and assist the government in completing the great cause of new democratic construction. The meeting finally passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and also passed resolutions to establish the Shanghai Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery and the People's Heroes Monument.

　　上海市解放一周年  各国代表集会庆祝
    【新华社上海二十八日电】五月二十七日为上海解放一周年纪念日。是日晚间，上海各界代表二千余人在市府大礼堂举行盛大庆祝集会，纪念这一伟大的上海人民的新生节日，庆祝上海人民解放一年来在克服困难的斗争中所获得的胜利。中央人民政府宋庆龄副主席莅会参予盛典。苏联驻沪领事符拉迪米洛夫、匈牙利公使馆第一参事费凯等亦应邀与会。
    上海总工会主席刘长胜宣布开会后，首由华东军政委员会曾山副主席致词。他指出：上海的解放，划开了上海历史上的新时代。帝国主义的长期侵略和二十余年来国民党反动政府的罪恶统治，使上海经济养成了严重的依赖性，因而在它转变为为人民服务的新城市过程中，遭遇了必然的困难和痛苦。但在上海解放一年中，大部分困难已经被克服。华东军政委员会和上海市人民政府今后将继续团结各界人民，为克服当前暂时困难而斗争。曾副主席着重提到财政经济问题。他说：人民政府不仅要发展公营企业与合作社，并要使有利于国计民生的私营企业在国营企业领导下也获得更大的发展，以达成新民主主义建设的目的。
    继由上海市人民政府潘汉年副市长向大会作关于上海市人民政府一年来工作的报告。潘副市长在报告中指出：上海市人民在人民政府领导下业已胜利地走过了最艰难的一年。
    接着，上海市各界人民协商委员会副主席刘鸿生讲话。他说：“一年来，上海人民在政治上翻了一个身。人民政府的施政，到处都表露出为人民服务的决心，这和解放前的蒋匪统治有天壤之别。”他表示各界代表将坚决以运用劳资协商的办法来维持生产、救济失业工人、完成税收任务和缴纳公债尾欠等实际行动，以贯彻第三次各界人民代表会议的精神，协助政府完成新民主主义建设的大业。会议最后通过致电毛主席朱总司令致敬，并通过建立上海市革命烈士公墓及人民英雄纪念塔等决议。
