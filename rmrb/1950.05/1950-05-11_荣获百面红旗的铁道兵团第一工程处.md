　　The First Engineering Division of the Railway Corps Awarded One Hundred Red Banners
　　By Our Reporter Lü Guangming
　　The First Engineering Division of the Railway Corps has won one hundred red banners in the past year. They have created brilliant achievements in the railway construction of New China.
　　In late November of the year before last, when our million-strong army began to press on Beiping and Tianjin, dozens of takeover personnel were ordered to form the "Pingbao Railway Construction Office" in Baoding, which was the predecessor of the First Engineering Division. In January of last year, the division absorbed more than 170 railway employees from the Changxindian and Liulihe areas and formed the First Engineering Team in Changxindian. In order to cooperate with the rapid liberation of Beijing by the troops, this new force fought heroically against the ice in the freezing weather below zero, and successfully completed the arduous task of building the Yongding River pontoon bridge. It also repaired the lines between Zhuoxian and Gaobeidian. In late January of last year, they braved the threats of enemy mines and machine guns and repaired the Beijing-Hankou Railway from Fengtai to the foot of Beijing City, ensuring military transportation and supply.
　　The emergency repair project of the line between Gaobeidian and Baoding started in mid-March. Due to the lack of steel rails and sleepers, they established close ties with the local governments and people along the line to find ways to collect materials. In order to solve the transportation difficulties, they used manpower instead of locomotives and pushed for fifteen consecutive days, transporting six freight cars of ties to the construction site. The workers launched a revolutionary competition, and the project progressed rapidly. The Beijing-Baoding section, which had been out of service for one year and seven months, was repaired and opened to traffic on May 20 last year. In order to ensure transportation during the rainy season, the restoration project of the eighteen large and small steel bridges in this section, with a total length of 860 meters across major rivers, was also completed on June 20 of the same year. On June 20, a grand ribbon-cutting ceremony was held in Baoding to celebrate the opening of the line.
　　The restoration project of the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section was the most arduous task undertaken by the division in the past year. The project started on June 2 last year. The entire section is 133 kilometers long and has a total of 108 bridges and culverts, with a total length of 2,996 meters, including nine major rivers such as the Tanghe River, the Shahe River, and the Hutuo River. At that time, it was the rainy season, and the mainstream was uncertain during the flood season. The division also lacked technical personnel for bridge repairs, which greatly increased the difficulty of the project. Railway materials were also in short supply. There were less than one hundred remaining steel rails on the roadbed of this section, and more than 29,000 steel rails were needed to cover this section of track. These difficulties were overcome one after another with the tenacious struggle of the workers and the strong support of the local farmers. In July, there were thirteen days of heavy rain, and the workers were soaked in sweat and rain all day long. On July 16, the Third Engineering Team was ordered to repair the Xintang River pontoon bridge. During the construction, the water rose and leveled the riverbed, and three-foot-high waves surged on the river surface. The first bridge frame that was erected was completely washed away, and the thousand-jin iron hammer was washed away for more than three miles. However, the ferocious flood could not scare the steel will of the heroes. They worked overtime and persisted in working in the water that was neck-deep every day, and erected the pile frame again. The flood surged again fiercely, and it was obvious that many materials were about to be washed away by the rapid current. Under the shouts of "Not a penny of state property can be lost," the workers jumped into the water to salvage them regardless of their personal safety. Some were dizzy from the waves, and some were choked by the flood. Some stayed with the materials and were washed away for several miles, and finally salvaged a lot of materials. Squad leader Yu Shuanglin sacrificed himself to rescue his comrades. The engineering division erected a monument to him on the bridgehead with the inscription "Eternal Glory to the People's Martyrs."
　　When the bridge construction reached the One-Two-Three Shahe River, new difficulties were encountered. The three Shahe Rivers are one kilometer long in total, and the riverbeds are all quicksand, paved with cement, and the piles could not be driven in. After repeated studies by the workers, the ties were built into a bottomless square "wooden caisson," which was sunk to the bottom of the river, wooden piles were erected in the middle, and filled with stones. However, it was washed away by the flood. They came up with the method of tying traction ropes to the old cement piers, and finally overcame the phenomenon of the wooden caissons tilting left and right. In just twenty days, they completed the arduous task of erecting a pontoon bridge across the three Shahe Rivers.
　　In order to greet the great October Revolution Day, all the workers actively rushed to repair the line with even greater labor enthusiasm. The vast number of farmers on both sides of the section actively supported and contributed more than 28,000 steel rails, 130,000 ties, and more than 10,000 pieces of equipment, which enabled the arduous project of the Baoding-Shijiazhuang section to be completed ahead of schedule.
　　In the past year, the division has completed the track laying project of 356 kilometers of lines, including 201 bridges of various sizes, as well as some station buildings, platforms, water supply equipment, and telecommunication signals in the northern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway and the northern section of the Datong-Puzhou Railway, and won one hundred award flags. After a year of training, the political consciousness of the workers has been further improved. They have promoted the collective wisdom of the working class, strengthened the close unity between workers and peasants, and are now beginning to move towards the direction of "field operations."

　　荣获百面红旗的铁道兵团第一工程处
    本报记者　吕光明
    铁道兵团第一工程处，一年来荣获百面红旗。在新中国人民铁道建设中，他们创造了光辉的成绩。
    前年十一月下旬，我百万大军开始进迫平津的时候，几十个接管人员奉命在保定组成“平保筑路处”，这就是第一工程处的前身。去年一月，该处吸收长辛店、琉璃河一带铁路员工一百七十余人，在长辛店组成第一工程队。为配合部队迅速解放北京，这支新生部队在零下的严寒天气中，和冰块英勇斗争，胜利完成永定河便桥的艰巨工程。并修复了涿县、高碑店间的线路。去年一月下旬，他们冒着敌人地雷、机枪的威胁，把京汉铁路从丰台修到北京城下，保证了军运供给。
    高碑店、保定间线路抢修工程，于三月中旬开工。因缺乏钢轨枕木，他们便和沿线地方政府和人民取得密切连系，设法收集材料。为解决运输困难，他们用人力代替火车头，一连推了十五天，把六个车皮的道木运到施工现场。职工们展开了革命竞赛，工程迅速进行，停车一年零七个月的京、保段于去年五月二十日便修复通车了。为保证雨季交通，该段十八条大小河流总长八百六十公尺的钢桥复旧工程，亦于同年六月二十日全部竣工。六月二十日，在保定举行了盛大的剪彩通车典礼。
    保（定）石（家庄）段的修复工程，是该段一年来所担负的最艰巨的任务。工程是在去年六月二日开始的，全段一百三十三公里，共有大小桥梁、涵洞一百零八座，总长两千九百九十六公尺；其中有塘河、沙河、滹沱河等九大河流。当时正值雨季，每到汛期主流不定，该处又缺少修桥技术员工，使工程进行增加很多困难。铁路器材也很缺乏。该段道床上残余的钢轨不满百条，要把这段轨道铺满，需要的钢轨是两万九千余条。这些困难都在职工们的顽强斗争与当地农民的有力支援下相继克服了。七月间下了十三天大雨，工人们整日为汗水、雨水浸湿着。七月十六日，第三工程队受命修复新塘河便桥。施工中，水涨平了河床，河面翻起三尺巨浪，第一次打上的桥架整个被冲走了，千斤大铁铊被冲出三里多地。但是，猛兽般的洪水，吓不倒英雄们的钢铁意志。他们加班加点，每天在齐脖子深的水中坚持工作，再次打起了桩架。洪水又猛烈的扑涨起来，眼看许多器材要被急流冲走。在“不丢掉国家一分财物”的呐喊下，工友们奋不顾身的跳下水去打捞，有的被浪头打得头昏，有的被洪水噎住嗓子。有的一直伴随着材料，被冲出三几里地，终于将不少的材料捞回。小队长于双林为接应工友而牺牲了，工程处在这座桥头上，给他立上“人民烈士永垂不朽”的纪念碑。
    当架桥工程进到一二三沙河时，又碰到了新的困难。三道沙河共长一公里，河底均系流沙，铺有洋灰，桩打不下。经过职工们多次研究，把道木砌成没底的方形“木沉箱”，沉在河底，当中立上木桩，填满石块。但是，又被洪水冲走了。他们又想出在旧洋灰墩上拴牵绳的办法，终于克服了木沉箱左右倾斜的现象。仅二十天，便完成三道沙河架设便桥的艰巨任务。
    为了迎接伟大的十月革命节，全体职工以更高度的劳动热情，积极抢修。该段两侧广大农民又积极支援献出两万八千多条钢轨、十三万棵道木和一万多件器材，使保石段的艰巨工程得以提前完成。
    在以往的一年中，该处在京汉北段和同蒲北段，共完成了包括大小桥梁二百零一座，及一部分站房、站台、给水设备、电讯号志的三百五十六公里线路钉道工程，荣获百面奖旗。经过这一年来的锻炼，职工们的政治觉悟进一步提高，他们发扬了工人阶级的集体智慧，加强了工农间密切的团结，现已开始向“野战化”的方向迈进。
