(Baoding News) According to the Hebei Daily news on May 10th: The CPC Branch and Village Government of Dongzhangjia Village, Nangong County, Hebei Province, wrote a letter to Chairman Mao, reporting on the completion of the cotton planting task. The original letter is as follows:

Dearest Leader Chairman Mao:

	The production situation of our village last year has already been reported in our New Year's greeting letter to you. Now our village has victoriously completed the cotton planting task. Now, we will report to you again on the completion of cotton planting in our village.

	After our village completed the annual production task last year, in winter, we led the masses to carry out a fertilizer accumulation campaign, summarized cotton planting experiences through winter school, and selected production models, which further improved the production technology and enthusiasm of the masses. The villagers deeply feel that planting more cotton is not only beneficial to the country's industrial construction, but also can make them rich. Therefore, the village government, based on the call from higher authorities, the specific situation of the village, and the demands of the masses, formulated a production plan: this year's cotton planting area will be expanded from 45% of cultivated land last year to 70%. Production increase requirements: the highest is to strive for 300 catties per mu, and the minimum is to receive 120 catties. In terms of fertilization, it is required to increase by one-third compared to last year; generally, 70 catties of soybean cake should be applied, and at least two large carts of manure should be applied. In terms of cultivation: plow the land once in spring, harrow three times, sow on time, hoe three times, and cultivate and tidy three to five times. Vigorously mobilize women to tidy up cotton, so that all women in the village learn to prune and trim branches. Under the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, all male and female labor in the village should help each other as much as possible in various forms to solve the difficulty of animal power. Regarding the work of substitute cultivation, further implement the work-point contract farming system to ensure that the output of substitute cultivated land reaches the level of the general masses. After the beginning of spring, the winter school study group will be transformed into a production technology research group, led by the production committee, to regularly study methods of planting cotton, tidying cotton, and preventing pests and disasters. After the above plan was formulated, it was approved by the county and district leaders and announced at the mass meeting; at the meeting, everyone proposed: to increase the production increase requirements to 30 to 40 catties more of seed cotton per mu.

	After this, all our party members, village cadres, labor models, and cotton planting experts conducted in-depth propaganda through various meetings, large and small, and in various ways; and used examples of their own production plans to help each household formulate production plans and actively do various preparatory work; by the end of March, the whole village had completed cotton planting preparations.

	In implementing the cotton planting plan, a mass production competition was launched. Party members and party members, farmers and farmers, groups and groups, streets and streets, each put forward five competitions (competing in planting more cotton, applying more fertilizer, cultivating diligently, tidying well, and increasing production). The village government helped the masses solve specific problems, such as households lacking livestock. In the past, they mostly exchanged grass for cattle work. This year, the method was changed to a contract-based exchange of work, that is, using cattle for one year at the cost of seven catties of cotton or twenty-three catties of millet per mu; this enabled 48 households lacking livestock in the village to plant more than 120 mu of cotton. Under the leadership of party members and village cadres, mutual assistance in borrowing and exchanging cotton seeds was widely carried out, solving the difficulties of more than 60 households lacking cotton seeds.

	In addition, some households raising cattle were afraid that there would be a shortage of grass if they planted too much cotton. The village cadres explained, and the village government also decided to organize mutual assistance after the autumn harvest to buy grass uniformly in other counties; this made many households raising cattle dare to plant a lot of cotton. There were also individual households who were afraid that they would not have enough grain to eat until the autumn harvest and were willing to plant some millet for early connection. The village cadres mobilized the masses for mutual assistance and free borrowing. For example, party member Hou Wenyou voluntarily lent Deng Junfu two bags of millet. This solved the problems of many grain-deficient households.

	In order to ensure timely sowing, our village launched a harrowing and fertilizer delivery campaign during the Spring Festival. By the end of January, the whole village had universally harrowed and covered the 2,400 mu of stubble land once or twice; then entered the spring plowing movement, and by March 20th, the spring plowing of the whole village was completed, and the work of selecting seeds began.

	In order to achieve the fertilization increase requirement, the whole village bought 160,000 catties of soybean cake. On February 23rd, a village meeting was convened to summarize the achievements of fertilizer accumulation last winter. The whole village accumulated 4,100 carts of fertilizer, one-third more than in previous years, and added 37 manure pits; the whole village launched a spring fertilizer accumulation campaign, striving to apply topdressing to the cotton fields by early summer. This year, the fertilization exceeded the original plan; the whole village's cotton fields averaged 80 catties of fine fertilizer and two carts of manure.

	On April 16th, after a thorough rain, the male and female masses of the whole village immediately engaged in the cotton planting movement, organizing a total of 42 sowing mutual aid groups, with most women participating in sowing seeds and helping with the seed drill. Many elderly people competed to pull the stone roller. The whole village victoriously completed the cotton planting plan in just six days. The whole village has 204 households, with 2,820 mu of cultivated land. In addition to 412 mu of wheat fields, a total of 2,002.9 mu of cotton were planted, accounting for 71% of the cultivated area, exceeding the plan allocated by the county and district by 592 mu, and 723 mu more than last year. There were 68 households that planted all the stubble land with cotton. Now the cotton seedlings have emerged, and the masses of the whole village are studying thinning and preparing to enter the stage of hoeing and tidying the cotton. All party members, village cadres, and masses in our village have full confidence in realizing the plan to increase production by 60,000 to 80,000 catties of seed cotton in the whole village.

	Our village was able to victoriously complete the cotton planting task because of your and the Party's wise leadership, as well as the specific leadership and help of the county and district cadres; furthermore, it is due to the improvement of the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of the masses of the whole village. We dare not have the slightest arrogance or complacency. In the future, we will definitely work harder, work actively, and lead the masses of the whole village to ensure the realization of the village government's entire production plan, and strive to produce 350,000 to 400,000 catties of seed cotton for the whole village!

	Respectfully wish you good health!

	And wish the central leaders good health!

		CPC Branch and Village Government of Dongzhangjia Village, Nangong County, Hebei Province

		May 4th Supplement:

	When we wrote the letter to you, we extensively solicited the opinions of the masses in the village, and all the masses in the village instructed us to write on the letter their hope that you would take good care of your health and lead the people to live a good life.

　　河北南宫东张家庄中共支部及村政府
　　向毛主席报告完成种棉任务
　　今年种棉面积扩大到占耕地的百分之七十
    【保定讯】据五月十日河北日报消息：河北省南宫县东张家庄中共支部及村政府写信给毛主席，报告完成种棉任务。原信如下：亲爱的领袖毛主席：
    去年我村的生产情形，已在给你的贺年信上报告过了。现在我村又胜利的完成了种棉任务。现在将我村完成种棉的情况，再向你报告一下。
    去年我村完成全年生产任务后，在冬天，领导群众开展了积肥运动，通过冬学总结了种棉经验，评选了生产模范，进一步提高了群众的生产技术和生产热情。乡亲们深深感到多种棉花，不但对国家工业建设有利，还能发家致富。因此，村政府就根据上级的号召、村的具体情况，和群众的要求，订出了生产计划：今年的种棉面积，由去年的占耕地百分之四十五，扩大到百分之七十。增产要求：最高的争取每亩收三百斤，最少的也要收一百二十斤。在施肥上，要求比去年增加三分之一；一般的要施豆饼七十斤，最少也要施粪肥两大车。在耕作上：春季把地耕一遍，耙盖三遍，按时下种，锄三遍，中耕和打整三遍到五遍。大力发动妇女打整棉花，做到全村妇女学会整枝打枝。在自愿两利原则下，全村男女劳力尽量不拘形式地互助起来，解决畜力困难。关于代耕工作，进一步贯彻工票包耕制，保证代耕地的产量达到一般群众的水平。开春后，将冬学学习小组，转变为生产技术研究小组，由生产委员会领导，经常研究种棉整棉和除虫防灾的办法。以上计划订出后，经过县区领导上的批准，就在群众大会上公布了；会上大家又提议：将增产要求提高到每亩多收籽棉三十到四十斤。
    这以后，我们全体党员、村干部、劳动模范、种棉能手，通过各种大小会议，利用各种方式，深入进行宣传；并以自己所订生产计划的实例，帮助各户订出生产计划，和积极做各种准备工作；到三月底，全村种棉准备就完成了。
    在贯彻种棉计划中，发动了群众性的生产竞赛。在党员与党员、农民与农民、组与组、街与街之间，互相提出了五比竞赛（比种棉多、比施肥大、比耕作勤、比打整的好、比增产多）。村政府帮助群众解决了具体问题，如缺牲口户，过去多是以草换牛工，今年改为包干换工办法，就是使一年牛，每亩出七斤棉花或二十三斤小米的代价；这样使全村四十八家缺牲口户，多种了一百二十多亩棉花。在党员、村干的带头下，普遍开展了互助借换棉籽，解决了六十多户棉籽不足的困难。
    另外，有部分喂牛户，怕种棉多了牲口缺草。村干部就进行解释，村政府还决议在秋收后组织互助，到外县统一买草；这样使许多喂牛户都敢大量种棉了。还有个别户，怕自己的粮食吃不到秋后，愿种些谷子早接口。村干部便发动群众互助，自由借贷。如党员侯文有自动借给邓俊福两口袋谷子。这样便解决了许多缺粮户的问题。
    为了保证按期下种，我村在春节当中，就开展起耙地送粪运动。到一月下旬，全村二千四百亩楂地，普遍耙盖了一遍到两遍；接着进入了春耕运动，到三月二十日，全村春耕即告结束，转入了选种拣籽工作。
    为了实现增肥要求，全村买了十六万斤豆饼。二月二十三日召开了村民大会，总结了去冬积肥的成绩，全村积肥四千一百车，比往年增多了三分之一，添了粪坑三十七个；全村开展春季积肥运动，争取到夏初往棉地施追肥。今年在施肥上超过了原订计划；全村棉地平均施细肥八十斤、粪肥两车。
    四月十六日落透了雨，全村男女群众立即投入种棉运动，共组织了四十二个播种互助组，大部妇女参加了撒籽、帮耧。许多老年比赛着拉砘子。全村仅六天时间，就胜利完成种棉计划。全村二百零四户，耕地二千八百二十亩，除麦田四百十二亩外，共种棉二千零二亩九分，占耕地面积百分之七十一强，超过县区分配的计划五百九十二亩，比去年多种七百二十三亩，把楂地全部种棉的就有六十八户。现在棉苗都已出齐，全村群众正在研究间苗，准备进入锄苗整棉。我村全体党员、村干部、群众，都有充分信心，实现全村增产六万斤到八万斤籽棉的计划。
    我村能够胜利完成种棉任务，这是由于你和党的英明领导，以及县区干部的具体领导和帮助；再就是全村群众政治觉悟和生产情绪的提高。我们决不敢有丝毫的骄傲和自满，今后一定更加努力，积极劳动，并带动全村群众，保证实现村政府的全部生产计划，为全村生产三十五到四十万斤籽棉而奋斗！
                            敬祝你的身体健康！
    并祝中央各领袖健康！
                河北省南宫县东张家庄中共支部、村政府
                                五月四日又：
    当我们给你写信的时候，曾广泛的征求村中群众的意见，全村群众都嘱咐我们，在信上要写上希望你好好保重身体，领导人民过好日子。
