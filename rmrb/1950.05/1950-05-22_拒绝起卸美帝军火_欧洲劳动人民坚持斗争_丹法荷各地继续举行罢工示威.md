　　Refusing to Unload American Imperialist Arms
    European Laboring People Persist in Struggle
    Strikes and Demonstrations Continue in Denmark, France, and the Netherlands
    [Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch] The laboring people of Denmark, France, the Netherlands, and West Germany are continuing to resist the arrival of American arms in Europe. According to a comprehensive TASS report: After the first batch of American arms arrived at the port of Aarhus, Denmark, a week ago, a group of local residents, holding placards with the slogan "Protest Against Unloading American Arms," demonstrated at the berth of the American arms ship. When the police arrested some of them and put them into prison vans, they sang songs of the resistance movement, and many nearby laboring people joined in the singing. At the same time, the Aarhus Democratic Women's Organization distributed leaflets throughout the city, which read: "Oppose the war maniacs who may turn our peaceful city into an arsenal! Do not send arms to our city! Oppose war!" The Danish Customs Employees' Union Council recently passed a resolution endorsing the decision of the Danish Port Workers' Union to refuse to unload American weapons at Danish ports.

    In France, the laboring people of Saint-Brieuc, upon learning that a train carrying American guns had arrived at the station, immediately lined up to demonstrate at the station, preventing the train from leaving. Women stood on the tracks in front of the locomotive, and demonstrators dismantled the train and wrote on it: "Down with guns! Fight for peace!" On May 12, hundreds of workers in Nantes also lined up on the tracks to prevent a train carrying American arms from departing, and thousands of residents surrounded the train, pushing an eight-and-a-half-ton cannon off the train. Peace advocates in Paris held a demonstration outside a station on the 16th, protesting a freight train carrying war materials departing from the station. They threw two trucks off the train, which was guarded by the military.

    Since dockworkers in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, went on strike for refusing to unload American arms, a campaign to raise relief funds for dockworkers is underway throughout the Netherlands. A Seaport Workers' Relief Committee has been specially established in Amsterdam. The committee issued an appeal to all friends of peace, saying: "We must help the dockworkers who are fighting on the front lines to defend the lives of our children."

    According to a dispatch from the Electric Communication Agency: After West German dockworkers decided to refuse to unload American arms, the American ship "Victoria," carrying arms, recently arrived in the port of Bremen. Because it could not be unloaded, it had to change ships and be transferred to Kaiser port, where the unloading was carried out entirely by Americans themselves secretly under the cover of darkness. Another American ship, the "Robin Gray," which had planned to unload cannon parts in Bremen, also left without unloading or stopping, intimidated by the power of the West German peace movement.

　　拒绝起卸美帝军火
    欧洲劳动人民坚持斗争         
    丹法荷各地继续举行罢工示威
    【新华社二十日讯】丹麦、法国、荷兰及西德等地劳动人民，继续抗拒美国军火运抵欧洲。综合塔斯社消息：第一批美国军火在周前到达丹麦的亚胡斯港以后，当地一群居民手执着“抗议起卸美国军火”的标语牌，到美国军火船停泊处示威。当警察逮捕其中一部分人上囚车的时候，他们高唱抵抗运动歌，附近许多劳动人民也跟着一道唱起来。同时，亚胡斯民主妇女组织在全城散发传单，上面写着：“反对可能把我们这和平的城市变为军火库的战争狂！不要把军火送到我们的城市来！反对战争！”丹麦海关雇员工会理事会于数日前通过决议，赞同丹麦港口工人工会的决定，拒绝在丹麦各港起卸美国武器。
    在法国，圣布利厄的劳动人民最近在获悉载有美国枪炮的列车抵站以后，即列队到车站示威，阻止列车离站。妇女们站在机车前面的轨道上，示威者把列车拆开，并在车上写：“打倒枪炮！争取和平！”五月十二日南特市数百工人也在轨道上列队阻止运美国军火的列车开驶，数千居民将列车包围，并将一门八吨半重的大炮自车上推下来。巴黎的和平拥护者十六日在车站外面举行示威，抗议一列装运战争物资的货车自该站开出。他们自军队所看守的列车上，把两辆卡车摔下来。
    荷兰鹿特丹海港工人拒卸美国军火而举行罢工以后，荷兰全国正在进行着为海港工人募集救济金的运动。阿姆斯特丹已特别成立了一个海港工人救济委员会。该委员会向一切和平之友发出呼吁说：“我们必须援助那些站在第一线为保卫我们孩子的生命而奋斗的码头工人们。”
    另据电通社消息：西德码头工人决定拒卸美国军火以后，最近到达不来梅港的一艘载运军火的美国船“维多利亚”号，因为无法起卸，不得不换船转运到凯撒港，而完全由美国人自己在夜幕掩盖下偷偷起卸。另一艘本拟在不来梅起卸大炮零件的美国船“罗宾格雷”号，也因慑于西德和平运动的威势，没有起卸也没有停留就开走了。
