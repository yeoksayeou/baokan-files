　　On the "Masses" Train
    By our special correspondent, Shi Guo
    On April 21st, at Shenyang East Station, I boarded the "Masses" train bound for Jilin.

    In the middle of the third-class and second-class cars, there was a car that was neither third-class nor second-class. Inside, there were soft seats (with springs) and sleeper berths. Lying on the bunks were pregnant women and two- or three-month-old babies; sitting were middle-aged and young mothers, amusing their children. They were as relaxed as if they were at home. This was a "Mother and Child Car" specially set up for mothers and children.

    In the second-class car, there was an onboard library. The book boxes were filled with theoretical books such as "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," as well as literary works such as "Record of Gao Gan" and "Forty Years by the Blast Furnace."

    Each car was equipped with a loudspeaker, broadcasting the conductor's announcements at any time. When the train was about to arrive at Fushun Station, the conductor announced in advance: "The next stop for this train is Fushun, with a ten-minute stop. Passengers who wish to disembark, please prepare your belongings."

    The train was rushing forward, the wheels humming dully, and the passengers were feeling tired. At this moment, the loudspeaker broadcast again: "Reporting some news to everyone: Our army has successfully landed on Hainan Island!" This victorious news cheered all the passengers in the carriages, and they cheered together.

    The train was speeding across the motherland, and the scenery of spring in the motherland unfolded before our eyes. Branches were turning green, new grass was sprouting, and free peasants were working in the fields. The onboard loudspeaker played "The Motherland March." Listening to this song of love for the motherland, praising freedom and happiness, made people feel even more intimate. Our people are also filled with hope and confidence, working hard for the freedom and happiness of the motherland.

    The various new impressions on the train reminded me of the trains in the old China of hardship and suffering thirteen years ago. At that time, when a person went out, no matter which railway train they were on, they would feel a sense of unease and tension: fearing getting on the wrong train, fearing missing their stop, fearing losing things, fearing offending the railway police on the train, fearing offending the train captain. At a station on the South Manchuria Railway, I saw railway personnel commanded by Japanese imperialists. They marked numbers on the backs of people buying tickets with chalk, and sold tickets according to the numbers, making people feel angry and ashamed. On the Pinghan Railway train, I saw Kuomintang railway personnel beating passengers who had lost their belongings. On the Zhengtai Railway, I saw railway personnel from Yan Xishan pushing sick people off the train.

    Now, the "Masses" train I am riding on has such a deep friendship with the people.

    On May 23rd of last year, the "Masses" train arrived at Fushun Station. Because of a "derailment" accident ahead, the "Masses" train had to stay overnight at Fushun Station. At that time, the equipment on the train was not complete. There was no dining car, and the vendors on the train had sold out of food and tea, leaving the passengers with hunger and thirst. The challenge facing the train captain was: to be detached from the masses or to serve the masses? The train captain of the People's Railway adopted the method of serving the masses. He negotiated with the Fushun Stationmaster, mobilized the family members of the station staff to make rice porridge for the passengers, and prepared pickles and boiled water, relieving the difficulties of the passengers. There was hope of driving on, but a new problem arose: the passengers who were changing trains at Meihekou would miss their transfer time. The passengers preparing to change trains were anxious. The train captain paid close attention to this matter. He discussed solutions with the Meihe dispatcher by telephone and asked the responsible railway bureau for instructions. The problem was solved, and the passengers were happy. When the "Masses" train arrived at Meihekou, the transferring passengers smoothly boarded another train. They stood at the train doors, leaned against the train windows, and cheered as they watched the slowly departing "Masses" train: "Masses Train! Goodbye! Train Captain! Goodbye!"

    On June 30th of last year, the "Masses" train was traveling between Qingyuan and Ying'emen. There was a pregnant woman in the carriage who was about to give birth. This was a matter of life and death, and the carriage immediately became tense. The train captain used the loudspeaker to solicit a doctor, and a warm-hearted midwife came forward. An old lady volunteered to help, supporting the woman in labor to another carriage, and the woman was able to give birth smoothly. The train captain prepared boiled water for her and bought eggs. When they arrived in Shenyang, the train captain wrote a letter, entrusting a passenger living in Dongguan to take the parturient to her home. The woman's husband was deeply moved. He ran to the station to find the "Masses" train captain and said as soon as he met him: "I understand the saying 'Workers of the world are one family' even more today. I will work harder in the factory to repay your friendship. In order not to forget the benefits of the People's Railway, I have decided to name this child 'Chesheng' (Train-born)."

    On October 18th of last year, the "Masses" train was traveling on the Shenji Line. In the third-class car, there were a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law with a child. Because the daughter-in-law was riding the train for the first time, she didn't know the rules of the train and told the child to defecate in the spittoon. The mother-in-law was afraid of being punished and quarreled with her daughter-in-law. The train captain came. He patiently explained the sanitary matters on the train and asked the train attendant to wash the spittoon. The passengers all said: The train captain solved this problem very well.

    The "Masses" train car group has achieved its current results because it has gained some successful experience, some of which are reflected in the following systems:

    Fixed Shift System: Fixed staff such as train, inspection, law enforcement, vending, and dining car staff work together on the same shift, cooperate with each other, and help each other. Before and after driving, they hold a small group meeting to discuss work tasks and check work progress. Sometimes locomotive crew members and transfer train captains also participate in this meeting.

    Safety Team System: The staff of the same shift are combined into three safety teams, each responsible for a section. At the same time, they maintain close contact with each other, take care of the safety of passengers, protect the equipment on the train from damage, and prevent accidents such as theft.

    Collective Labor System: Crew members on the same shift help each other under the condition that it does not hinder the work of their respective departments. For example, inspectors help the law enforcement team with inspections, vendors help train attendants clean, and baggage handlers help the supply company load and unload goods.

    Three-Check System: To prevent errors in supplementary ticketing, the train captain first checks it himself after completing the supplementary ticketing procedures, then checks it with the train attendant, and checks it again after arrival. No errors have occurred in supplementary ticketing on the train. The three-check system has now been promoted to all car groups in the entire section.

    Three-Signature System: Reporting Signature: The train captain writes the work situation of all aspects of the staff on the train on the signature and sends it to the superiors of the staff of each department. Communication Signature: Each train captain writes the work situation and experience of this train on the communication signature, and exchanges work experience with each other during train meetings (passing trains). Questioning Signature: Each car group raises questions to each other and answers each other's questions.

    The original foundation of the "Masses" train was not good.

    Before the "May 1st" in 1949, the Northeast Railway Administration rectified passenger cars and ordered each administration to repair a passenger car. All the employees of the Jilin Locomotive Depot worked together to repair a dilapidated passenger car into a fully equipped passenger car. It was named the "Masses" on "May 1st" and was the responsibility of the Li Jinghua car group. Initially, the car body equipment was very poor, most of the car windows were nailed with wooden boards, only three lights in the car could be lit, and ticket inspection had to be done with a gas lamp. Only three spittoons were left. There was no water in the washbasins and toilets. There was no second-class car, no sleeper car, and no dining car. The heating was also not working well, some cars were so hot that people couldn't wear cotton clothes, and some cars were so cold that people were stomping their feet. The seats were nailed with wooden boards, and nails often came out and snagged clothes. More importantly, the axles often overheated. The route was not good, and the work of various departments was not well coordinated, affecting on-time operation (failure to arrive on time). It took thirty hours to travel from Shenyang to Jilin (now it takes fourteen hours and thirty-nine minutes).

    With the development of the People's Railway, and after arduous improvement work, the "Masses" now has ten carriages: seven third-class cars, one mother-and-child car, one second-class/dining car combination, and one self-use car. The train is equipped with a radio and an in-car loudspeaker, and has newly equipped a mobile library and a first-aid kit. It has become the banner of the "Jitie" passenger train.

    On the "Masses" train, I met the train captain, Li Jinghua. He is twenty-seven years old and from Jilin City. He is humble and amiable to people. The crew members are all young people, showing liveliness and joy. In the car group, there is a young train attendant named Sun Baosheng, who used to be adventurous and naughty. He liked to jump on the train when it was running fast, and he liked to lie down on the track pillows and let the train pass over him. Because of his naughtiness and adventure, the train captains were unwilling to work with him. When he was transferred to work on the "Masses" train, the other train captains were worried about Li Jinghua, fearing that his presence would affect the work of the whole group. Li Jinghua had confidence in helping Sun Baosheng. After Li Jinghua's patient education, Sun Baosheng has become an active member of the Youth League.

    Li Jinghua himself often says: I have been a train captain for eight years, and I spent the first six years muddling through, and only in the last two years did I realize that I was serving the people. Yes, it is because Li Jinghua knew that he was serving the people that the people also knew Li Jinghua. Many passengers have written one hundred and eight letters praising him.

    The "Masses" train and the Li Jinghua car group have created a brilliant model of serving the people, which has promoted the work of train captains in the entire Jilin train section and improved the passenger transport work of the Jilin train section. The Jilin Railway Administration awarded Li Jinghua a major commendation, and the entire group two minor commendations, and two awards. On March 9th, the Li Jinghua car group was approved as a backbone Iron Ox car group. On March 15th, the Northeast Railway Administration held the first notice competition conference, and Li Jinghua won first place.

    From February 5, 1949, to March 15, 1950, the Li Jinghua car group traveled 90,000 kilometers, and the supplementary ticketing revenue on the train was 320 million yuan.

    The "Masses" train is constantly moving forward. The next stop is Jilin, and I have finished my journey of fourteen hours and thirty-nine minutes. I have received a lot of education. The train entered the station, I said goodbye to the "Masses" train, said goodbye to the train captain Li Jinghua, I watched the female train attendant help the mothers and children get off the train, I followed the orderly disembarking passengers out of the station.

### 在“群众号”列车上

　　在“群众号”列车上
    本报特约记者　石果
    四月二十一日，在沈阳东站，我上了开往吉林的群众号火车。
    在三等和二等车的中间，有一节既不是三等也不是二等的车厢。里面设有软席（有弹簧的坐位），和卧铺。铺上躺着的是怀孕的妇人，和二、三个月的婴儿；坐着的有中年和青年母亲，在逗着孩子们玩。她们像坐在家里一样轻松。这是为母亲和孩子特设的“母子车”。
    在二等车里，有随车书库。书箱上放着论人民民主专政等理论书；也有高干大、鼓风炉旁四十年等文艺作品。
    每个车厢都设有广播机，随时播送着车长的通告。当火车要到抚顺站时，车长提前广播通告：“本列车下一站是抚顺，停车十分钟。请要下车的旅客们准备好自己的东西。”
    火车在急行着，车轮闷声闷气的哼着，旅客都有倦意。这时广播机又放出声音：“向诸位报告一个新闻：我军胜利登陆海南岛。”这胜利消息振奋了车厢里所有的旅客，他们一齐的欢呼。
    火车在祖国大地上奔驶着，祖国春天的景象，展开在眼前，树枝挂绿，小草新生，自由的农民在农田里工作。车内广播机奏起“祖国进行曲”。听着这个热爱祖国，歌颂自由和幸福的歌声，愈使人感到亲切。我们的人民也满怀着希望和信心，为祖国的自由和幸福而努力建设。
    火车上的种种新印象，使我联想起十三年以前苦难中的旧中国的火车。那时，一个人出门走路，无论在那条铁路的火车上，都会感到一种不安和紧张：怕上错车，怕坐过站，怕丢东西，怕触犯了火车上的路警，怕得罪了车队长。在南满路一个车站上，我看见过日本帝国主义指挥的铁路人员。他们在买票人的背上用粉笔划上号数，按号买票，使人感到愤怒和耻辱。在平汉路的火车上，我看到国民党的铁路人员，毒打丢了东西的旅客。在正太路上，我看见阎锡山的铁路人员，把病人推下火车。
    现在我所坐的“群众号”列车却与人民有着这样深厚的友谊。
    去年五月二十三日，群众号列车到达抚顺站。因前边发生“脱线”（火车出辙）事故，群众号必须在抚须站停留一夜。当时车上设备不完全。没有餐车，车内小贩已把食物、茶水卖完，摆在旅客面前的是饥、渴。摆在车长面前的是：脱离群众呢？服务群众呢？人民铁路的车长，采取了服务群众的办法。他与抚顺站长商妥，动员了站上的员工家属，给旅客做了大米粥，准备了咸菜和开水，解除了旅客的困难。开车有希望了，可是新的问题又来了，在梅河口换车的旅客，都会错过换车的时间。准备换车的旅客都在着急。车长十分注意这件事。他用电话与梅河调度员商量办法，请示主管的路局。问题解决了，旅客都喜欢。群众号列车到梅河口时，换车旅客顺利上了另一列火车。他们站在车门上，靠在车窗前，看着徐徐开行的群众号欢呼：“群众号！再见！车长！再见！”
    在去年六月三十日，群众号列车走到清源——英额门间。车内有一孕妇，就要生产。这是个生死问题，车内马上紧张起来。车长用广播机征求医生，一位热心的助产士出来。一位老太太自愿帮忙，把临产的妇人扶到另一车中，妇人得以顺利的生产。车长给她准备了开水，买了鸡蛋。到沈阳时，车长写一封信，托一位在东关住的旅客把产妇送到家里。产妇的丈夫深受感动，他跑到车站找群众号车长，见面就说：“天下工人（他是冶炼工人）是一家这句话，我今天更明白了，我在工厂里要更加劲生产，来报答你们的友谊，为了不忘记人民铁路的好处，我决定要给这个孩子起名叫‘车生’”。
    去年十月十八日，群众号行驶在沈吉线上。在三等车内，有婆媳二人带着一个小孩，因媳妇初次坐火车，不知道车内规矩，叫小孩子在痰盂里大便。婆婆骇怕受罚，跟儿媳吵起来。车长来了。他耐心讲解了车上卫生事情，叫列车员把痰盂洗刷了。旅客们都说：这个问题，车长解决的很好。
    群众号包车组能有现在的成绩，是因为他们已取得了一些成功的经验，其中一些经验，则表现在下述一些制度上：
    固定同班制：由列车、检车、执法、贩卖、餐车等固定工作人员联合同班工作，互相配合，互相帮助。在开车前后，都开一次小组会，讨论工作任务，检查工作情况。有时机务乘车员、转运车长也参加这种会议。
    安全小组制：把同班乘务各方面的工作人员，联合分成三个安全小组，分段负责。同时互相密切联系，照顾旅客的安全，保障车上设备不受损坏，防止偷窃等事故发生。
    集体劳动制：同班乘务员，在不妨碍本部门工作的条件下，互相帮助。如检车员帮助执法队检查，贩卖帮助列车员清扫，行李员帮助供应社装卸货物等。
    三检制：防止补票发生错误、车长办完补票手续后，自己先检查一次、再与列车员互检一次，到达后再检查一次。车内补票没有发生过错误。现在三检制已推行到全段各包乘组。
    三签制：汇报签：由车长把同班各方面工作人员在车上的工作情形，写在签上，寄给各部门工作人员的上级。传达签：由各车长把本列车工作情形和经验，写在传达签上，在会车（错车）时，彼此交流工作经验。试问签：各包乘组互相提问题，互相解答问题。
    群众号的原来的基础并不好的。
    在一九四九年“五一”前，东北铁路总局整顿客车，责成各管理局修好一列客车。吉林机务段全体员工一致努力，把一列破旧的客车，修成一列装备完全的客车。在“五一”命名为群众号，由李静华包车组负责。当初车体装备很差，车窗大部分钉着木板，车内只剩三个灯能亮，检票都得带着瓦斯灯。痰盂也只剩下三个。脸盆、便所都没有水。没有二等车，没有卧车，没有餐车。暖气也不好使，有的车热的穿不住棉衣，有的车冻的直跺脚。座位是木板钉的，经常有钉子出来挂衣服。更重要的问题是车轴常发热。路线不好，各部门工作配合不好，影响正点运行（不能按时到站）。由沈阳到吉林需走三十个钟头（现走十四小时三十九分钟）。
    随着人民铁路事业的发展，经过艰苦的改进工作，现在群众号已拥有十个车厢：七个三等车，一个母子车，一个二等、餐车共用车，一个自用车。车上装有无线电收音机和车内广播机，新设备了巡回书库、救急箱。成为“吉铁”客运列车的旗帜。
    在群众号列车上，我会见车长李静华，他二十七岁，吉林市人。对人谦虚、和蔼。乘务员都是青年，表现出活泼和愉快。在包乘组中有个青年列车员，叫孙宝生，过去好冒险而顽皮。他喜欢在火车开的很快时跳上车，喜欢在路线枕上伏下，让列车由上边通过。由于他的顽皮和冒险，各车长都不愿跟他在一起工作。他调到群众号列车上工作时，别的车长都为李静华担心，怕因为有了他而影响全组工作。李静华有信心帮助孙宝生。经过李静华的耐心教育，孙宝生已成为积极的青年团员。
    李静华自己常说：我当了八年车长，前六年是糊里糊涂的混过了，后两年才知道为人民服务。是的，正是李静华知道了为人民服务，人民也知道了李静华。多少乘客，写了一百零八封信表扬他。
    群众号列车和李静华包乘组创造了光辉的为人民服务的典型事迹，推动了吉林列车段全段的车长工作，使吉林列车段的客运工作提高了一步。吉林铁路管理局给李静华记大功一次，给全组记小功两次，并给奖两次。在三月九日，批准李静华包乘组为基干铁牛包车组。在三月十五日，东北铁路总局召开首届通告竞赛大会，李静华获得第一。
    由一九四九年二月五日至一九五零年三月十五日，李静华包乘组走行了九万公里，车内补票进款三亿二千万元。
    群众号列车不断的前进着。下一站就是吉林，我结束了十四个钟头又三十九分钟的旅途生活。我受到了很多的教育。列车进站了，我告别群众号列车，告别了车长李静华，我看着女列车员帮助母亲和孩子们下车，我随着有秩序下车的旅客走出了车站。
                                一九五○年四月二十五日
