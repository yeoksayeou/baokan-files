　　Preliminary Review of "Wenyi Bao" Editorial Work
    Wenyi Bao Editorial Department

    On April 21st, newspapers and periodicals published the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Periodicals." After reading it, we were very excited. After studying the articles of Comrade Stalin and Chairman Mao, we have more clearly recognized the importance of criticism and self-criticism in China's current situation. Therefore, it has great instruction and inspiration for our editorial work. We understand that to run our publication well, it is not only necessary for our work to be connected with the masses and have educational significance for the masses, but also to greatly open the windows and let the voices of the readers rush into our editorial department, so that the masses have a high degree of enthusiasm to criticize us, point out our mistakes, and not let go of even the smallest negligence. Of course, we need to make subjective efforts to gradually improve politically and professionally, so that the editorial department can highly grasp policies and be creative, but to truly better promote the work, we must have a profound self-examination and listen to the opinions of the masses.

    In order to respond to the correct call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, recently, we made a preliminary review of the fifteen issues of "Wenyi Bao." Because we have not studied well enough, it may not be profound and appropriate, but our attitude is sincere. We have taken the first step in self-examination. We welcome readers to give further criticism so that our editorial work can better meet the current needs of the literary and artistic movement.

    "Wenyi Bao" has been edited to the sixteenth issue. Judging from the feedback from various aspects, it has played a certain role. It has had a wider and closer connection with the masses, and has solved certain problems in literary and artistic work, creation, and thought. The direction of its work is generally correct. This is mainly thanks to the help of many literary and art comrades and the enthusiastic encouragement and support of the broad masses, in addition to the leadership of the National Federation of Literary and Art Circles and the active work of the editorial department comrades. However, "Wenyi Bao" is not up to our required level and cannot satisfy us. "Wenyi Bao" still has many shortcomings in its editorial work.

    First: The most important shortcoming is that it has not combined closely enough with politics through various forms of literature and art, and has not widely touched on various aspects of the current political movements. "Wenyi Bao" only published such articles in a few issues, and as editorials or special issues, but the content was not substantial, as if it only played a decorative role. Although this also includes another reason, that is, today's general writers are not very accustomed to immediately grasping new issues and themes, expressing their thoughts in various forms, and expressing their concern and enthusiasm for the various movements that the government is calling for and unfolding. But our editorial department also did not think of this problem, or even if we did, we did not make enough efforts to mobilize and organize writers because we encountered difficulties, so that they would have a high interest in writing. The reason for this is still that we lack a high degree of concern and serious study of politics. Although we understand that the first requirement for a work is its political nature, we do not yet understand how to actively organize manuscripts suitable for quickly reflecting current political tasks in accordance with current political tasks.

    Second: In terms of raising literary and artistic thought, the publicity and research of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" is very insufficient. This kind of publicity and research work is very necessary and urgent at present. We know that among literary and art workers, there are still many people who do not understand this talk, or do not understand it enough, and there is still some confusion in literary and artistic thought. For example, some people say that literature and art are politics; others say that my thoughts have been transformed long ago and I have long been a proletarian; others say that I wrote about workers and peasants before the War of Resistance Against Japan, but you just didn't read it; and others say that the talk was for people in Yan'an because they had ideological problems. Although the people who say these things support Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy even in their hearts, it just proves that they lack a basic understanding and research of the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art." Even for literary and art workers who have a good understanding of Chairman Mao's literary and artistic policy and have practiced it in their own creations, it does not mean that they have no problems at all in literary and artistic thought. The environment we are in today is much more complex than in Yan'an, and the objects of literary and artistic work are much broader than at that time. Therefore, many new problems are constantly emerging in literary and artistic work, which need us to solve. Whether we can use Chairman Mao's thought to solve the current specific problems in literature and art is the test of whether we have truly learned the "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art."

    We have paid attention to the problems in literary and artistic thought. In each issue, we have organized some articles related to literary and artistic thought, but now it seems that the content is not substantial and profound enough. We have also launched some discussions, but some problems have not been fully developed. For example, the question of whether or not to write about the petty bourgeoisie, which caused controversy in Shanghai, we think is a question worth discussing. We asked Comrade He Qifang to write an article "A Controversy on a Literary Creation Problem," which was not intended as a conclusion, but no more manuscripts came, so we did not try to continue it. Later, in the readers' letters, it was reflected that this problem was still not fully understood. The same is true for the issue of accepting heritage.

    In the debate on some issues, we were not clear enough in expressing our attitude and opinions. For example, the debate on "Red Flag Song." We received many articles about "Red Flag Song," with two extreme opinions, the most obvious being Cai Tianxin's and Liyang's. We disagree with both of these articles. We planned to publish an article with a more appropriate criticism, and at the same time write a criticism of these criticisms, but due to the rush of time, it was not completed. Xiao Yin wrote an article, but it was only as a personal opinion. In his article, we thought there were still some inappropriate and imperfect places. In the editor's note, however, it was only suggested that "they be published together for everyone's reference," which resulted in a lack of responsible attitude. Another example is the poetry notes, which were originally solicited for everyone's opinions and did not draw conclusions because there could not be a conclusion at one time, and it was planned to cooperate with one or two more systematic and more correct articles as the main opinions. However, these manuscripts came too late, and the editorial department's ability was limited, so we could not publish our opinions at one time. We had to put up Antokolsky's "Poetry - Youth Education - Culture" as a reference, but our thoughts could not be guessed. Therefore, although this discussion aroused great interest among readers, the effect was not great. Therefore, in literary and artistic thought, some of the problems we raised have not been solved thoroughly, and some attempts have been made to solve them but have not been solved well.

    Third: We have failed to better cooperate with the current literary and artistic movement. Although we have continuously published reports on literary and artistic work in various places and introductions or summaries of certain experiences, we have not conducted regular and systematic research on these situations and experiences. Therefore, we have failed to fulfill our responsibility of guiding literary and artistic work in various places well. Even the connection with the literary and artistic work in the capital is not close enough. For example, we also went to see the plays in the factory literary and art competition held in Beijing last winter, and we also specially commissioned manuscripts, but because we did not grasp it tightly, it did not reflect and help them well; another example is the cultural train held by the Railway Trade Union and the Youth Theater, which is an innovation, using the train to bring culture to various places and into factories, but we did not pay enough attention to it. We have not organized systematic and in-depth critical articles on the several major dramas staged in Beijing.

    Fourth: Our readers are more focused on authors and literary and art workers. Therefore, our articles are also aimed at this kind of audience. We have not paid enough attention to the broad literary and art enthusiasts and general readers. "Wenyi Bao" should not only be a garden and cafeteria for literary and art workers, but also should guide the masses on how to absorb nutrition from literature and art, transform their thoughts, and eliminate old tastes.

    We have many shortcomings, which are summarized into the above four main points. But why are there these shortcomings? That is because our editorial department has not placed the study of politics and policies in the most important position. At the same time, we have not studied enough in our profession. Therefore, there is little research and improvement work, and we are buried in administrative work, reading manuscripts, replying to letters, etc. So we cannot expand the editorial work, nor can we have a more serious attitude and a spirit of not being perfunctory to deal with every small article or every line of words that we take out.

    There are very few staff members in the editorial department, and their abilities are limited, but this cannot be used as a reason for us not to improve. We cannot excuse ourselves with difficulties, but we must improve ourselves from objective needs.

    What should we do in the future? In which aspects will we develop?

    One: Under the leadership and help of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, we will increase the summaries of literary and art movements in various places and strengthen the ideological guidance of literary and art movements in various places. This is very important. Only in this way can "Wenyi Bao" play its due role.

    Two: Strengthen the cooperation between literature and art and current politics, strengthen the political nature of the publication, and improve the political and ideological level of the publication.

    Three: Launch discussions on literary and artistic thought and creation issues to improve the level of literary and artistic thought and strengthen the ideological cultivation and literary and artistic cultivation of general literary and art enthusiasts and beginners in writing.

    Four: Strengthen the research, guidance, and criticism of mass literature and art. In the past, there were many reflections on the situation, and there were many opinions and experiences on factory literature and art, soldiers performing as soldiers, and the reform of quyi, but there was a lack of detailed research, proposing criticisms, and solving specific problems in the articles.

    Five: Make more specific analysis and criticism of works, starting from works that are more familiar to readers or are most worthy of introduction as soon as possible, in a planned, step-by-step, and focused manner.

    Six: Call on the literary and art circles to break the atmosphere of not criticizing, fearing criticism, and irresponsible criticism behind the scenes, and establish proper and serious criticism and self-criticism. We welcome the publication of articles of criticism and self-criticism on works, work, thoughts, and style, whether it is directed at a collective or an individual. Of course, we oppose making criticism and self-criticism very trivial and causing unprincipled disputes. We oppose malicious attacks that are not kind to people, which are not good for the people's cause, or even worse.

    Seven: Strive for simple words, deep meaning, and deep problems, but write clearly, clearly, and affirmatively, and avoid ambiguous twists and turns that make people feel unfathomable. We want to make people feel that the text is cordial, the reasoning is clear, and we are for the sake of making people like to read, understand, and benefit from reading, rather than making people afraid to read, not understand, and reading is equivalent to not reading. This is a requirement for authors, and it is also what we want to encourage ourselves. We must grasp this direction to determine the selection of articles.

    Our preliminary review results are roughly like this. There must be many inadequacies. We hope that readers will give us more help. "Wenyi Bao" belongs to the masses.

　　《文艺报》编辑工作初步检讨
    《文艺报》编辑部
    四月二十一日，各报纸刊载了中国共产党中央委员会的“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评的决定”。我们读了之后，非常兴奋，在我们学习斯大林同志和毛主席的文章之后，更认清了批评与自我批评在中国今天情况下的重要，因此对于我们的编辑工作，有很大的指示和启发。我们明白要将我们的刊物办好，不只是需要我们的工作与群众有联系，对群众有教育意义，而是要大大的打开窗子，让读者的呼声，冲到我们的编辑部来，使群众有高度的热情来批评我们，指摘我们的错误，即使是最小的疏忽也不放过。固然我们须要主观的努力，在政治上、在业务上逐渐提高，使编辑部能高度的掌握政策，且富有创造性，但真正要把工作更好的推进，只有深刻的自我检讨，倾听群众的意见。
    为了响应中国共产党中央委员会的正确地号召，在最近，我们将十五期的《文艺报》做了一个初步的检讨，因为我们学习得还不够好，不一定深刻和恰当，但我们的态度是诚恳的。我们在自我检讨上开始走了第一步，我们欢迎读者更进一步给以批评，使我们的编辑工作能更切合于文艺运动的当前的需要。
    《文艺报》已经编辑至第十六期，从各方面的反映看来，起了它一定的作用，它与群众有了较广泛、较密切的联系，解决了文艺工作上、创造上、思想上的某些问题。它的工作的方向大体上是正确的。这除了依靠全国文联的领导和编辑部同志的积极工作之外，主要感谢许多文艺界同志们的帮助和广大群众的热情鼓励与支持。但《文艺报》是不够我们要求的水平的，不能使我们满意，《文艺报》在编辑工作上还有许多缺点。
    第一：最主要的缺点，是没有通过文学艺术的各种形式与政治更密切地结合，广泛地接触目前政治上各方面的运动。《文艺报》只有几期刊登了这样的文章，并且作为社论或特辑，但内容不充实，好像只起了点缀的作用。这里面，虽然也包含了另外一个理由，就是今天一般的作家们，还不很习惯即刻抓住新的问题和题材，用各种形式来表达自己的思想，来表示对政府正在号召正在展开的各方面运动的关心和热心。但我们编辑部也同样没有想到这个问题，即或想到，也因为遭遇困难而没有作足够的努力，发动与组织作家们，使他们有很高的兴趣来写。这原因也还是因为我们对政治缺乏高度的关心与认真的学习。我们虽然懂得对一篇作品首先要求它的政治性，但还不很懂得要配合当前的政治任务如何主动地去组织适合于迅速反映当前政治任务的稿件。
    第二：在提高文艺思想方面，贯彻宣传与研究毛主席“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”非常不够。这种宣传和研究的工作，在目前是十分必要和迫切的。我们知道在文艺工作者中，还有许多人对这个讲话是不了解的，或了解不够的，文艺思想上还存在某些混乱。譬如有人说文艺即政治；也有人说我的思想老早就改造了，老早就是无产阶级的；也有人说我在抗战前就写的工农，不过你们不看就是；也还有说那篇讲话是给在延安的人看的，因为他们思想有问题。说这些话的人们，虽然他们口头上甚至心上也是拥护毛主席的文艺方针的，却恰好证明了他们对“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”还缺乏起码的了解和研究。就是对毛主席文艺方针了解得较多，并在自己创作上身体力行了的文艺工作者，也不是就等于在文艺思想上完全没有问题了。我们今天所处的环境，比在延安的时候，复杂得多了，文艺工作的对象，也比那时候更广泛得多了，因此文艺工作上就不断涌出许多新的问题，需要我们解决，我们能不能运用毛主席的思想来解决当前文艺上的具体问题，这就是我们是否真正学会了“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”的考验。
    我们是注意了文艺思想上的问题的，在每期上，我们都曾组织一些有关文艺思想的文章，但现在看来，内容充实深刻的还嫌不够。我们也曾发动一些讨论，但有些问题没有充分展开，例如在上海引起争论的关于可不可以写小资产阶级的问题，我们认为是一个值得讨论的问题，我们请何其芳同志写了一篇《一个文艺创作问题的争论》，本来也不是作为结论的，但跟着没有来稿了，我们也就没有设法继续下去，后来在读者的来信中，反映出这个问题也仍未完全搞通，对于接受遗产的问题也如此。
    在有些问题的争论上，我们还不够更明确地表示我们的态度和意见。例如对于“红旗歌”的争论。我们收到好些关于“红旗歌”的文章，有两种极端的意见，最明显的是蔡天心和犁阳的两篇，我们对这两篇文章都不同意，我们打算登一篇批评得比较适当的文章，同时并写一篇对这几篇批评的批评，但因时间的匆促，没有写成，萧殷写了一篇，但也只是作为个人的意见，在他的文章中我们认为也还有些不够恰当不够完善的地方。在编者的按语上，却只提出“一起登载出来，供大家参考”，结果，就显得缺乏负责的态度。再如诗歌笔谈，本是征集大家意见，不做结论，因为不能一时有结论，并拟配合一二篇较有系统、也较正确的文章为主要意见。但这些稿子来的太迟，编辑部能力有限，不能一时发表我们的意见，只好将安托科尔斯基的《诗——青年的教养——文化》一文放上，作为参考，但我们这种心思，也无法教人猜测。因此这个笔谈，虽引起读者很大兴趣，而效果并不大。因此在文艺思想上，我们所提出的问题，有些没有解决得彻底，有些企图解决而没有解决好。
    第三：未能更好地与当前的文艺运动配合，我们虽然不断地发表各地文艺工作的报导与某些经验的介绍或总结，但对于这些情况和经验，我们没有经常的系统的研究。因此，就未能很好负起指导各地文艺工作的责任。就是与首都文艺工作的联系也不够密切。例如去年冬天北京举办的工厂文艺竞赛，我们也去看了戏，也特约了稿，但由于抓的不紧，并没有很好的反映和帮助他们；再如铁路工会与青年剧院所举办的文化列车，这是一个创举，将文化用列车驶到各地去，驶进工厂去，我们也没有去十分注意。对北京上演的几个大话剧，也没有组织系统的较深刻的批评文章。
    第四：我们的读者对象偏重于作者与文艺工作者，因此我们的文章，也就针对着这种对象，我们对广大的文艺爱好者和一般读者的注意就不够了。《文艺报》应该不只是文艺工作者的园地、食堂，而且应该指导群众如何从文艺上来吸收营养，改造思想，扫除旧趣味。
    我们缺点很多，归纳为上面的主要的四条，但为什么会有这些缺点的？那是由于我们编辑部还没有将学习政治、政策，放在最首要的地位。同时对业务的学习也不够，因此自身的研究工作、提高工作少，而埋头在事务工作中，看稿、回信等。所以我们不能把编辑工作展开，也不能有更严肃的态度，毫不苟且的精神，来处理我们手上拿出去的每一篇小文章或每一行字。
    编辑部工作人员是非常少的，能力有限，但这不能作为我们不能提高的理由。我们不能以困难来原谅自己，而要从客观需要来提高自己。
    以后怎么办呢？我们将向着那几方面发展？
    一：我们要在文联的领导帮助之下，增多各地文艺运动的总结，和加强对各地文艺运动的思想指导。这是很重要的，只有这样，《文艺报》才能发挥它应有的作用。
    二：加强文艺与当前政治的配合，加强刊物的政治性，提高刊物的政治思想水平。
    三：展开文艺思想创作问题的讨论，借以提高文艺思想水平，加强对一般文艺爱好者与初学写作者的思想修养与文艺修养上的帮助。
    四：加强对群众文艺的研究、指导与批评，过去情况反映的多，对于工厂文艺、兵演兵、曲艺改革等都有不少的意见和经验，但缺少有细致研究，提出批评，解决具体问题的文章。
    五：多作作品的具体的分析批评，从较为读者熟悉的或比较最值得尽先介绍的作品开始，有计划、有步骤、有重点的作。
    六：号召文艺界打破不批评、怕批评、背地下不负责任的批评等的空气，建立正当的严肃的批评与自我批评。我们欢迎登载对作品、对工作、对思想、对作风的批评与自我批评的文章，不管是对一个集体或对一个个人。当然我们反对把批评与自我批评弄得很琐碎而引起无原则的纠纷，我们反对不是与人为善的、而是恶意的打击，对人民的事业没有好处，或者更有坏处的批评。
    七：力求文字浅显，含义要深，问题要深，却要写得明白、清楚、肯定，力避含含糊糊曲曲折折使人有深不可测的感觉，我们要使人感觉文字亲切，情理分明，我们是为着使人喜欢读，读的懂，读了有益，而不是使人怕读，读不懂，读了等于不读。这是对作者的要求，也是我们要自勉的，我们要掌握这个方向以决定文章的取舍。
    我们的初步检讨结果，大抵如此，不够之处一定很多，希望读者多多予以帮助，《文艺报》是属于大众的。
                                  （转载《文艺报》第十六期）
