　　The Rising Living Standards of the People in Northeast China
　　By Our Special Correspondent Tian Liu
　　People coming to Northeast China from all over the country say that Northeast China is now good in three ways: stable prices, good production development, and the national benefit of balanced finances. The three goods combine into one good: the good life of the people.
　　What are the opinions of the people of Northeast China themselves? Liang Wenyuan, a worker at the Fuxin Coal Mine, often says when mobilizing his team members to work hard: "If the country is good, our lives will be good too." Recently, his team broke the state's new coal mining quota again, exceeding the target by 40%, and was respected by all employees and rewarded by the state.
　　The working class and the broad masses of farmers in Northeast China have personally experienced the truth that they are the masters of the country. Therefore, they work heroically, and therefore the country is getting better day by day, and therefore the lives of the broad masses of the people are becoming better and better.
　　At the end of 1949, the Northeast Bank conducted a survey of the living conditions of 247 employee households in Shenyang. The wages of these employees have generally increased. Almost all of them have joined the employees' cooperative. Daily necessities such as grain, oil, salt, coal, and cloth are supplied by the cooperative at low prices; 70% of the workers and their families live in the employee dormitories of factories and enterprises, 90% of which are free of charge. All workers and their families in state-owned and public-owned factories and mines enjoy state labor protection. Large factories and enterprises have employee hospitals or clinics, where workers receive free treatment, and family members receive treatment at half price or reduced price. Employees enjoy preferential treatment for water and electricity, taking streetcars, watching dramas and movies...…
　　The People's Government is extraordinarily concerned about the lives of the working class. Last year, the state's labor insurance expenditure accounted for 9% of the total wages of all workers in the light industry sector and 11% in the heavy industry sector. Most of this insurance fund remained in the enterprise to run employee welfare programs and conduct labor protection. A portion was handed over to the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions as a labor insurance fund for the entire working class in Northeast China. According to statistics from the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, from April to November last year, the labor insurance funds legally handed over to the Federation of Trade Unions by various enterprises totaled 7,666,366 work points (each work point is equivalent to more than three catties of sorghum based on Northeast China grain prices). Collective labor protection undertakings are being established gradually but rapidly. Currently, the worker welfare programs directly run by the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions include two clinics, two hot spring sanatoriums, and one worker hospital. The programs established by the enterprises themselves include 22 nurseries, six old-age homes, two orphanages, four sanatoriums, and two amateur sanatoriums. The medical equipment for workers is constantly growing and improving. Currently, there are 40 worker hospitals and 220 clinics in the entire region, with nearly 4,000 medical personnel serving in the aforementioned institutions. Over 90% of workers and 1.5 million worker family members in the entire region are enjoying state labor protection.
　　With the restoration of production and the improvement of productivity, workers' wages are also rising rapidly. In May last year, the average wage of workers was 110 work points, rising to 140 points by the end of the year, an increase of 27%. This year, the Northeast People's Government has decided to further increase the wage level by 7% to 8% and has allocated huge sums of money to build 1.73 million square meters of new housing for employees. Last year, the number of employed people in state-owned enterprises alone increased by more than 240,000, and this year it will increase by another 220,000, which not only fundamentally solves the unemployment problem but also feels the lack of labor. In addition to actively mobilizing the broad masses of people to participate in industrial construction, a large number of skilled workers are being recruited from within the customs. The working class in Northeast China has begun to live a good life, and unemployment and hunger are no longer the inevitable companions of the working class in Northeast China.
　　The People's Government has historical and traditional concern for farmers. In 1945, after the Northeast Region was liberated from the iron hooves of the Japanese aggressors, the Northeast People's Government, while leading the people of Northeast China in the People's Liberation War, also led the peasants in a thorough land reform, destroying the feudal land system, and more than 20 million poor peasants were given land, horses, and houses. Over the years, the government has vigorously promoted labor mutual aid and promoted new agricultural technologies. Agricultural production has been rising year by year, and by 1949, the cultivated area had been expanded by more than 2 million hectares (10,000 square meters per hectare). In 1947, the average yield per hectare was 1,500 jin of grain; in 1948, it rose to 1,920 jin. Last year, although Northeast China suffered from drought in the north and flooding in the south, the output still reached 90% of the planned output. This year, the government plans to invest and loan 500,000 tons of grain to promote new agricultural tools, build water conservancy projects, and promote improved varieties, planning to produce 18 million tons of grain in the entire region, reaching 93% of the highest output during the Puppet Manchukuo period (1943). This year, 97,000 hectares of flax will be sown; the planting area of ​​cotton will exceed the highest level of 220,000 hectares during the Puppet Manchukuo period, reaching 234,000 hectares.
　　Over the years, the Northeast People's Government has taken various effective measures to systematically and step by step improve the lives of farmers. Last year, state-owned stores and cooperatives purchased 1.7 million tons of surplus grain and local products from farmers at high prices, and supplied farmers with industrial products of good quality and low price worth 3.26 million tons of grain. This avoided or greatly reduced the intermediate exploitation of unscrupulous merchants. From the changes in the exchange ratio of industrial products and agricultural products in recent years, we can clearly see the improvement of farmers' lives. In 1946, one ton of grain could only be exchanged for 0.8 bolts of cloth; in 1947, it could be exchanged for 1.7 bolts of cloth; in 1948, one ton of grain had been exchanged for 2.2 bolts of cloth; last year, it was exchanged for 3.3 bolts of cloth. Compared with 1946, the price of grain has increased more than four times, that is, the price of cloth has decreased by 80%; this year, the People's Government also plans to increase the price of grain, so that one ton of grain can be exchanged for 3.5 bolts of cloth. The burden on farmers has been relatively reduced year by year with the end of the war, the expansion of the region, and the improvement of production. In 1948, the average burden on farmers accounted for 23% of their harvest, which was reduced to 19.5% last year. In this way, the lives of farmers have been significantly improved. Many farmers are adding cars and buying horses, building new houses and changing new clothes. Heilongjiang Province, known as the "granary of Northeast China," although it suffered a drought last year, due to the expansion of cultivated land area and the improvement of farming techniques, the output still increased by more than 1.1 million shi compared with 1948, and the economy of 50% of the farmers in the province began to rise. In Songjiang and Jilin provinces, the number of rising households has accounted for 60% to 70% of all farmers. The broad masses of farmers gave their government heartfelt praise in their own life experiences: "Grain is expensive, cloth is cheap, and public grain is light."
　　The economic lives of the broad masses of the people are rising step by step, and their cultural lives are also becoming richer and developing rapidly. Every factory and mine has worker night schools, literacy classes, or technical training classes. According to statistics from the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions in December last year, in the five provinces of Jilin, Heilongjiang, Songjiang, Rehe, and Liaoxi, the three cities of Anshan, Benxi, and Shenyang, the four major industries of coal mining, railways, textiles, and salt, and 14 units including Inner Mongolia and Dalian, extremely incomplete statistics show that there are 3,624 cultural night schools, with 177,240 workers participating in the study. There are three worker universities and twelve specialized schools in Northeast China, with nearly 9,000 workers studying there. Every city has established large-scale cultural centers or clubs, which regularly organize the working people to study and disseminate scientific knowledge. Last winter, more than one million workers, farmers, youth, and women in Northeast China participated in the winter study movement. In the Lushun-Dalian area, adult literacy education was universally carried out in 1949, reducing the illiteracy rate from 30% of the total population to 4%. This area may eliminate illiteracy this year. The development of school education is also very rapid. There are now 16 schools above the specialist level and more than 35,000 primary and secondary schools in Northeast China. The number of schools has exceeded 60% of the Puppet Manchukuo period, and the number of primary school students has reached 3,777,151, an increase of 48.2% compared with the Puppet Manchukuo period. There are 143,698 middle school students, an increase of more than 108% compared with 1941. There are more than 16,000 people studying in universities and specialized schools. This year, the Northeast People's Government will also vigorously develop engineering schools and train a large number of industrial technical cadres. The doors of schools have been opened to the broad masses of working people, and the number of outstanding workers, farmers, and their children entering schools to study is increasing year by year. In 1949, children of workers and peasants accounted for 81.3% of the total number of students in primary schools. This is something that has never happened in Chinese history.

　　东北人民生活上升中
    本报特派记者  田流
    从全国各地来到东北的人，都说如今东北有三好：物价稳定好，生产发展好，财政平衡国家好。三好合一好：人民生活好。
    东北人民自己有些什么意见呢？阜新煤矿工人梁文元在动员他的组员们努力生产时，经常说：“国家好了，咱生活也就好了。”最近他这一组，又突破了国家新的采煤定额，超过任务百分之四○，受到了全体职工的尊敬和国家的奖励。
    东北工人阶级和广大农民，在亲身体验中，已经认识了自己是国家的主人这一真理，因此他们英勇劳动，因此国家一天比一天好了，因此广大人民的生活，也就日益美好起来了。
    一九四九年底，东北银行曾在沈阳市调查了二百四十七户职工的生活状况。这些职工的工资普遍上升。几乎全体都入了职工合作社。生活必需的粮食、油盐、煤炭、布匹等都由合作社低价供给；有百分之七○的工人及其家属都住在工厂企业的职工宿舍里，其中有百分之九○是免费的。所有国、公营厂矿的工人及其家属，都享受着国家的劳动保护。大工厂企业都有职工医院或医疗所，工人免费治疗，家属半费或减费治疗。职工用水电、坐电车以及看戏看电影等都有优待………。
    人民政府对于工人阶级的生活是异常关怀的。去年国家支出的劳动保险金，在轻工业部门占全部工人工资总合的百分之九，在重工业部门则占百分之十一。此项保险金大部分留在本企业，兴办本单位的职工福利事业及进行劳动保护。一部分交到东北总工会，作为全东北工人阶级劳动保险基金。据东北总工会统计，从去年四月至十一月，各企业依法交到总工会的劳动保险基金，共达七百六十六万六千三百六十六工分（每工薪分如以东北粮价计算，约合高粱米三斤多）。集体的劳动保护事业正在逐步的但却是迅速的创办着。现在由东北总工会直接举办的工人福利事业已有两个医疗所，两处温泉疗养院和一处工人医院。由各企业自己创办的有二十二个托儿所、六处养老院、两处孤儿保育院、四处疗养所和两处业余疗养所。工人的医疗设备，更在不断的增长和改进中。现在全区已有四○个工人医院，二二○个医疗所，有近四千的医务人员在上述的院所中服务。全区已有百分之九○以上的工人和一百五十余万工人家属，享受着国家的劳动保护。
    随着生产的恢复和生产率的提高，工人的工资也迅速升涨着。去年五月，工人的平均工资是一一○工薪分，到年底升达一四○分，提高百分之二十七。今年东北人民政府已经决定，还要把工资水平再提高百分之七、八，并拨出巨款，为职工建筑一百七十三万平方米新住宅。去年东北仅公营企业就业人数，就增加了二十四万余人，今年还将增加二十二万，不仅根本解决了失业问题，而且已感到劳力的缺乏。除积极动员广大人民参加工业建设外，正在关内招收大量的技术工人。东北工人阶级已开始过好日子，失业和饥饿已不再是东北工人阶级不可避免的伴侣了。
    人民政府对于农民，是有着历史的、传统的关怀的。一九四五年，东北区从日本侵略者铁蹄下解放出来后，东北人民政府一面领导东北人民进行人民解放战争，同时，领导农民进行了彻底的土地改革，摧毁了封建的土地制度，有二千余万贫苦农民分得了土地、马匹和房屋。数年以来，政府大力提倡劳动互助，推广新的农业技术，农业生产年年上涨，至一九四九年，已扩大耕地面积二百余万垧（每垧一万平方米）。一九四七年，每垧平均产粮一五○○斤；一九四八年升至一九二○斤。去年东北虽北旱南涝，遭受严重天灾，仍达到计划产量的百分之九○。政府今年以五○万吨粮食的巨额投资和贷款，推广新农具、兴修水利、推广优良品种，计划在全区产粮一八○○万吨，达到伪满时最高产量（一九四三年）的百分之九三。今年播种亚麻九万七千垧；棉花的播种面积要超过伪满时二十二万垧的最高水平，达到二十三万四千垧。
    数年来，东北人民政府采取各种有效的办法，有系统有步骤地改善农民的生活。去年，国家商店及合作社以高价收购农民的剩余粮食及土产品一七○万吨，供给农民价值三二六万吨粮食的价廉物美的工业品。避免或大大减少了奸商的中间剥削。从几年来工业品与农产品交换比价的变动中，可以清楚看到农民生活改善的情况。一九四六年一吨粮只换○·八匹布；一九四七年能换一·七匹布；一九四八年一吨粮已换到二·二匹布；去年更换到三·三匹布。去年和一九四六年比较，粮价上升了四倍以上，也就是布价降低了百分之八○；今年人民政府还计划把粮价提高，使一吨粮能换到三·五匹布。农民的负担，随着战争的结束，地区的扩大和生产的提高，一年年相对的减轻了。一九四八年农民负担，平均占其收获量的百分之二十三，去年已减低到百分之十九点五。这样，农民的生活就显著的改善了。许多农民都在添车买马，盖新房换新衣。素有“东北谷仓”之称的黑龙江省，虽然去年遭受旱灾，但由于耕地面积的扩大和耕作技术的改进，产量还是比一九四八年增加一百一十万石以上，全省有百分之五○的农户，经济开始上升。松江和吉林等省，上升户已占全体农户的百分之六○到七○。广大农民在自己的生活体验中，给自己的政府以衷心的赞辞：“粮贵、布贱、公粮轻。”
    广大人民的经济生活步步上升，文化生活也日益丰富、迅速发展了。各个工厂、矿山都有了工人夜校、识字班或技术训练班。据东北总工会去年十二月统计，吉林、黑龙江、松江、热河、辽西五个省，鞍山、本溪、沈阳三个市，煤矿、铁路、纺织、盐业四大产业，和内蒙旅大等十四个单位极不完全的统计，已有文化夜校三千六百二十四所，参加学习的工人有十七万七千二百四十人。全东北已有三所工人大学和十二所专门学校，有近九千工人在那里学习。各个城市都建立起规模宏大的文化馆或俱乐部，经常组织劳动人民学习，传播科学知识。去年冬天，全东北有百万以上的工人、农民、青年和妇女参加了冬学运动。旅顺大连地区，一九四九年普遍开展成人识字教育，将原来占总人口百分之三○的文盲，减少到百分之四。今年该区可能消灭文盲。学校教育的发展也是十分迅速的，现在东北共有十六所专科以上的学校，中小学有三万五千余处，学校数目已超过伪满时百分之六○，小学生的人数已达三、七七七、一五一人，比伪满时增加百分之四八·二。中学学生达一四三、六九八人，较一九四一年增加了百分之一○八以上。有一万六千余人在大学和专门学校读书。今年东北人民政府还将大力发展工科学校，大量的培养工业技术干部。学校的大门已向广大劳动人民洞开，优秀的工人农民及其子弟，入校学习的人数逐年增加，一九四九年小学中工农子弟已占全体学生人数的百分之八一·三。这是中国历史上从来没有过的事。
