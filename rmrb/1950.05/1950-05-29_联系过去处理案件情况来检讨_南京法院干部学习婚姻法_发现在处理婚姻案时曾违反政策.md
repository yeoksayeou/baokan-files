　　Contacting Past Case Handling to Conduct Self-Criticism
    Nanjing Court Cadres Study Marriage Law
    Discovering Past Violations of Policy in Handling Marriage Cases
    [Nanjing News] According to Nanjing Xinhua Daily, cadres of the Nanjing Municipal People's Court studied the Marriage Law and, in connection with marriage cases handled over the past ten months, examined the cadres' thinking. From this study and examination, it was discovered that some cadres still harbor remnants of feudal ideology, and that many errors and deviations occurred in the handling of marriage cases, seriously violating marriage policy.

    Some cadres, in order to conclude cases, simply emphasized reconciliation, regardless of policy principles. For example, tricycle worker Xu Shixiang sold his wife for one stone of rice, and the rice had been fully received. Xu Shixiang went to the court to sue, saying that the rice had not been fully received. After investigating the facts, the court "educated" Xu Shixiang, saying, "The rice has been fully received, you should not sue again," and dismissed the matter. Such handling is equivalent to acknowledging the legality of the feudal buying and selling marriage system. Another example is the case of a girl, Lan Duxiang, who was promised by her adoptive mother to Chen Peixian as a child bride for three mace of gold. Her father, Lan Shanji, went to the court to sue. The result of the court's mediation was: "Lan recognizes Chen as his son-in-law, the man shall not marry another, and the woman shall not marry another, otherwise they will be subject to legal sanctions." This, in effect, protected the feudal child bride system. Another example is the court "reconciled" a case of a "concubine" suing her husband and "first wife" for abuse. The reconciliation agreement stated: "The three shall establish a normal husband-wife relationship; if there is further dispute, it shall be deemed that the husband, Wang Zhizhong, violated the reconciliation." The People's Court, in handling the case, even regarded polygamy as a "normal" husband-wife relationship.

    Some cadres harbored the idea of valuing men over women, simply blaming women for unreasonable phenomena between men and women, without pursuing their social roots or actively educating and reforming them. They even held contemptuous attitudes towards prostitutes and mistresses, while not pursuing men for seduction and bigamy. For example, a woman, Liao Xiaowen, was seduced and cohabited with a man, Sun Yongkui, and sued him in court. The result of the handling was to end the cohabitation, without any punishment for the seduction. Another example is a young man, Zhu Gensheng, seduced a fourteen-year-old girl. After her mother sued in court, the result of the handling was reconciliation and allowing them to marry, without mentioning a word about the seduction of a minor. Still another example is the woman Yang Guilan suing her husband for adultery and demanding a divorce. The court approved the divorce, but required the woman to return the bride price; the man's adulterous behavior was not questioned.

    Some cadres believed that freedom of divorce would cause chaos, and therefore interfered with the man's freedom of marriage after divorce. For example, a woman, Zhang Youliang, lived with a lover, and her husband sued in court, requesting a divorce. The court granted the divorce, but stipulated in the reconciliation agreement that "the woman shall not cohabit with her lover," which resulted in the plaintiff interfering with the marriage of his divorced wife, on the pretext that the court gave him this right to interfere. Her subsequent marriage had to be with his permission.

    After studying the Marriage Law, the cadres of the court, in addition to gaining a relatively deep understanding of the Marriage Law, also realized that in order to correctly grasp the spirit of the Marriage Law, they must eliminate the remnants of feudal ideology they brought from the old society. Everyone also conducted a self-criticism of the errors they committed in handling marriage cases in the past, and pledged to implement the Marriage Law thoroughly and correctly.

　　联系过去处理案件情况来检讨
    南京法院干部学习婚姻法
    发现在处理婚姻案时曾违反政策
    【南京讯】据南京新华日报消息：南京市人民法院干部学习了婚姻法，并联系十个月来所办理的婚姻案件，检查了干部的思想。从这次学习、检查中发见某些干部还存在着封建思想的残余，在处理婚姻案件中发生了不少错误与偏差，严重地违反了婚姻政策。
    有的干部为了了结案件，单纯地强调和解，而不顾政策原则。例如三轮工人徐世祥以一石米的代价出卖了自己的妻子，米已收足。徐世祥到法院告状，说米未收足。法院查清事实之后，“教育”徐世祥说：“米已收足，不应再告。”就此了事。这样处理，等于承认了封建的买卖婚姻制度的合法。又如女孩兰杜香被其养母以三钱金子许给陈培贤作童养媳，她的父亲兰善吉到法院告状，法院为他们和解的结果是：“兰认陈为女婿，男不得另婚，女不得另嫁，否则受法律制裁。”这样，实际上是保护了封建的童养媳制度。又如法院“和解”了一件“小老婆”控告丈夫和“大老婆”虐待的案件之后，和解书上说：“三人建立正常夫妻关系，如再有争论，当以丈夫王志中违犯和解论。”人民法院处理案件，竟把一夫多妻认为“正常”的夫妻关系。
    有的干部存在着重男轻女的思想，简单地将男女间的不合理现象归罪于妇女，而不追求其社会根源，积极地教育改造她们。甚至对妓女、姘妇抱轻视态度，对男子诱奸、重婚等则不加追究。例如妇女廖小文被男子孙永魁骗诱同居，控告到法院。处理结果是脱离同居，对诱奸一节没有处分。又如有一青年男子朱根生诱奸了十四岁的幼女。她的母亲向法院控告之后，处理结果是和解并让他们结婚，对诱奸未成年幼女部分一字未提。再如妇女羊桂兰控告丈夫与人通奸，要求离婚。法院虽批准了离婚，但要女方退还聘礼；对男方通奸行为，不加闻问。
    有的干部认为离婚自由会造成混乱，因之干涉男方离婚后的婚姻自由。例如妇女张有良与人姘居，丈夫告到法院，请求离婚。法院充许了离婚，却在和解书上规定“女方不得与姘夫同居”，以致造成原告对已离婚的妻子的婚姻加以干涉，借口说是：法院给他这个干涉权。她以后结婚，要经他的许可。
    该院干部在此次学习了婚姻法之后，除对婚姻法有了比较深刻的认识以外，并认识到要正确地掌握婚姻法的精神，必须清除自己从旧社会带来的封建思想的残余。大家并对过去处理婚姻案中所犯错误都作了检讨；保证要使婚姻法彻底地、正确地执行。
