Popular Science Periodicals Published in Shanghai
　　Excerpt from "Science Popularization Newsletter" Issue 2

　　*Science Pictorial* is edited by the Science Society of China and has a history of seventeen years. It has many illustrations and is beautifully printed. China's early science popularization work was somewhat influenced by advertising from capitalist countries, seeking novel but not popular materials from American magazines. In the past, *Science Pictorial* used this method to disseminate some scientific knowledge to young Chinese intellectuals. Recently, the journal is being reorganized, stipulating that workers, peasants, soldiers and their cadres are the target audience.

　　*Science Era*, edited by the Science Era Society, was founded in Chongqing in 1945 and later moved to Shanghai for publication. From the beginning, it used new perspectives to handle manuscripts, requiring science to be linked to the actual situation of Chinese society. Under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries at the time, each issue's editorial raised a clear banner for the scientific work of New China. However, due to insufficient material conditions, it could not be published on schedule. It will soon be taken over by the Shanghai Branch of the China Association for Science and Technology.

　　*Science Popularization* is edited by the Science Popularization Society and was founded in Shanghai after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan. The journal's text is simple and it focuses on reporting on domestic production undertakings, but its shortcoming is looking at problems in isolation, without deeply understanding the reality of Chinese society, committing a similar mistake to *Science Pictorial*. After liberation, it cooperated with several scientific organizations, with each organization being responsible for column manuscripts such as "Popular Astronomy," "Popular Geology," and "Popular Biology," determining that its nature was to popularize basic knowledge of natural science and assist teaching in regular and short-term schools at all levels.

　　*Electrical World* is a popular electrical engineering monthly journal initiated by the Chinese Society of Electrical Engineering and published by the Electrical World Society, making considerable efforts to popularize electrical engineering knowledge. The reader mailbox answered many questions for readers. In addition to targeting electrical engineering technicians and students in various places, this kind of publication should also pay attention to the large number of electrical power and telecommunications technicians across the country, providing them with materials for learning their business. In recent issues, the standard of its content has become higher and higher. As a popular electrical engineering monthly journal, we require it to be even simpler than before.

　　*Chemical World* is a popular chemistry monthly journal edited by the Chinese Chemical Industry Society. In the past, under unstable economic conditions, maintaining the publication of a popular science journal specializing in one subject was really not easy. The journal should pay attention to simplicity in terms of writing techniques and content, making it more popular, and it seems that it can also add some experimental and process manufacturing materials.

　　*Popular Agriculture* and *Popular Medicine* are both sister publications of *Science Popularization*, edited by a group of medical workers and a group of agricultural science workers, respectively. Their characteristic is that the text is relatively simple. *Popular Agriculture* was biased towards dogma in the past. After liberation, it has gradually moved from the study to the vast fields. If it can cooperate with policies and seasons in a planned and focused manner in the future, popularizing agricultural science knowledge under the government's policy of restoring and improving agricultural production, it can make many contributions. *Popular Medicine* has achieved good results in popularizing medical and health knowledge, but in the past it only targeted intellectuals and petty citizens. In the future, it should focus on helping workers, peasants, and soldiers master sufficient health and hygiene knowledge.

　　*Maternal and Child Health* is a journal that focuses on introducing maternal and child care and medical knowledge and reporting experience in maternal and child health work. It is hoped that the journal will especially focus on health and medical knowledge related to women and children in factories and rural areas in the future, and will be published on schedule.

　　*Production and Technology* was originally called "Engineering World," and was marked as a popular and practical engineering monthly journal. Judging from the published issue, not only has the name been changed, but the content also broadly includes industrial and agricultural technology, and its nature also belongs to a journal for scientific and technical workers and technical workers. This issue focuses on the production management responsibility system, which is a concrete manifestation of its efforts to combine technology with production.

　　Editor's Note: Among the existing popular science journals, *Science and Technology Newsletter* is the most successful. We have already commissioned someone to write a special article to introduce it.

　　上海出版的通俗科学期刊
    节录《科学普及通讯》第二期
    李忻
    《科学画报》是中国科学社主编的，已有十七年的历史。图多，印刷精美。中国的早期科学普及工作，多少受到资本主义国家广告宣传的影响，向美国杂志找一些新奇而并不通俗的材料。科学画报过去通过这样的方式向中国青年知识分子传播了一些科学知识。最近该刊正在改组，规定以工农兵及其干部为对象。
    《科学时代》，科学时代社主编，一九四五年创刊于重庆，后迁到上海出版。一开头便用新的观点来处理稿件，要求科学与中国社会的实际情况相联系。在当时的国民党反动派统治下，每期社论已为新中国的科学工作揭起鲜明的旗帜。可是因为物质条件不够，不能按期出版。最近将由中国科协上海分会接办。
    《科学大众》是科学大众社主编，于抗战胜利后创刊于上海的。该刊文字浅显，对国内生产事业有着重的报道，但其缺点是孤立的看问题，没有深入地了解中国社会的现实情况，和《科学画报》犯着类似的毛病。解放后，它和几个科学团体合作，由各团体分别负责《大众天文》、《大众地质》、《大众生物》等专栏稿件，确定以普及自然科学的基本知识，辅导各级正规和短期学校教学为性质。
    《电世界》是中国电机工程学会发起、电世界社出版的通俗电学月刊，对于电工知识的普及有相当的努力。读者信箱为读者解答了很多问题。这种刊物，除了以各地方的电机工程技术人员和学生为对象外，最好也能注意到全国数量极多的电力、电信技术工人，供给他们学习业务的材料。近几期来，其内容的水准越来越高，作为通俗电学月刊，我们要求它比从前还要浅显一些才合宜些。
    《化学世界》是中华化学工业会主编的通俗化学月刊，在过去经济不安定的情况下，维持一种专门一科的通俗科学刊物的出版，也着实不容易。该刊在文字技术和内容方面，似应注意浅显，使它更大众化，另外似还可以加添一些实验和工艺制造的材料。
    《大众农业》和《大众医学》都是《科学大众》的兄弟刊物，分别由一群医务工作者和一群农业科学工作者编辑的。它们的特点是文字比较通俗。大众农业过去偏于教条，解放后已渐渐从书斋走向广大的田野，今后倘能有计划有重点地配合政策，配合节令，普及农业科学知识，在政府恢复和提高农业生产的方针下，是可以有不少贡献的。大众医学在普及医药卫生知识方面有很好的成绩，不过过去只是以知识分子和小市民为对象，今后应该注重帮助工农兵掌握足够的健康卫生知识。
    《妇婴卫生》是一种以介绍妇婴护理及医药知识和报道妇婴卫生工作经验为中心内容的刊物。希望该刊今后特别着重有关工厂农村的妇女幼儿的卫生医药知识，并且按期出刊。
    《生产与技术》原来叫做“工程界”，标明是一种通俗实用的工程月刊。从已出的一期看，不仅名称有了改动，内容亦广泛地包括了工业农业技术，而且性质也是属于科学技术工作者和技术工人的刊物了。这一期以生产管理负责制为中心内容，是它努力将技术与生产结合起来的具体表现。
    编者附注：现有的通俗科学期刊，以《科学技术通讯》为最成功，我们已约请人写专文介绍。
