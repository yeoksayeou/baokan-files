     × Regiment Political Department's Report on Handling Violations of Mass Discipline by Troops Stationed at the Temple of Heaven

    I.  The Circumstances of the Incident:

    (1) Since the 3rd Company was stationed in the Temple of Heaven, the company's cadres were ideologically negligent regarding mass discipline. They believed that there were no masses in the Temple of Heaven, so they couldn't violate mass discipline. As a result, they relaxed discipline education for the troops. When borrowing tools to build fortifications, they didn't organize and research well, but simply told the platoon leaders to borrow from the masses by platoon, resulting in chaotic procedures. In particular, after they damaged the tools of the local people, the company and platoon only knew to compensate, without considering whether the compensation satisfied the masses. At the same time, the tools they borrowed were not returned on time (even during the inspection on April 21st, there were still two items not returned). Some issues were reported to the company, but were not seriously handled, leading to dissatisfaction among the masses.

    (2) The facts that occurred are as follows: damage to one handcart (four beams broken), two sickles, two pickaxes, loss of one axe, and two shovels returned to the wrong person; there were two instances of poor attitude towards the masses.

    II. The Handling of the Incident:

    The regiment received instructions from the higher-level political department on the evening of April 19th and immediately sent a mass work cadre along with the political instructor of the 1st Battalion to inspect the company the next day. They gathered the squad leaders to understand what things they had borrowed from the masses since moving to the Temple of Heaven and the compensation for damaged items. The true situation was found to be completely consistent with the opinions of the masses. Thus, the mass work cadre and the political instructor immediately went to the local public security police station to ask them to conduct a more detailed investigation. After clarifying the situation, the regiment decided to compensate and apologize to the masses, and use this incident to educate the entire regiment.

    (1) Conducting in-depth education within the company. On the 21st, an enlarged meeting of the company's party branch committee was held for self-criticism, with the participation and guidance of Political Commissar × and Deputy Political Commissar ×. Everyone unanimously believed that the error occurred because the leadership was ideologically negligent, did not actively contact the local government, and showed a bureaucratic style towards the masses, which seriously affected the reputation of the entire army. This self-criticism was generally quite profound. We conveyed the spirit of the Party Committee's self-criticism at a general meeting of soldiers, to improve the soldiers' understanding of this violation of discipline. Following this, each squad held separate squad meetings for self-criticism.

    (2) Making compensation and apologies. On the evening of the 21st, the political instructor of the 1st Battalion and the political instructor of the company held a mass meeting at the police station. More than 40 people attended, including the owners of the damaged items, nearby residents, and group leaders, as well as comrades from the police station and the district people's government. First, the head of the police station explained the reason for the meeting to the masses. Then, the political instructor of the company made a self-criticism in front of the masses. The political instructor, on behalf of the regiment and battalion, explained that the leadership had not done enough in educating the troops on mass discipline, and apologized to the masses. Finally, in coordination with the group leaders and comrades from the police station, they compensated the masses 77,000 RMB based on the extent of their losses and according to the principle of not letting the masses suffer losses. The masses were very satisfied with this handling. After the meeting, everyone said, "It's still the People's Liberation Army, the past troops could never do this!"

    (3) Conducting education throughout the regiment. This violation of mass discipline by the 3rd Company was due to the leadership's negligence and bureaucratic style. After the incident occurred, they did not handle it seriously, which greatly damaged the reputation of our army among the masses. Therefore, the regiment gave Company Commander An Ping and Instructor Su Wenbo a disciplinary warning; Platoon Leader Wu Chengzhang knew that he had damaged the masses' property but did not ask the superiors for instructions on how to handle it beforehand, and only reported it to the superiors after the soldiers automatically compensated a small amount, which had already left a bad impression on the masses, was also given a disciplinary warning; Deputy Squad Leader Yang Jinsuo and soldier Wang Chuncheng had a poor attitude when borrowing things from the masses, causing dissatisfaction among the masses, and were given a reprimand. The regiment also plans to circulate the facts of this violation of discipline by the 3rd Company throughout the regiment, instructing the battalion committees and branches to launch discussions within the troops to improve the troops' level of understanding, and to conduct a discipline inspection in each unit with a serious and solemn attitude. Borrowed items should be cleared, and if there are any violations of discipline, compensation and apologies must be made, so that the political influence of our army will no longer suffer losses.

     ×团政治处处理天坛驻军违反群众纪律的报告
    一、事情发生经过：
    （一）三连自驻入天坛后，该连干部对群众纪律问题在思想上是麻痹的。他们认为在天坛内没有群众，犯不了群众纪律，因之在平时放松了部队纪律教育。在修建阵地借用工具时，没有很好组织研究，而只是告诉排长以排为单位向群众借用，手续上很紊乱。特别是他们损坏了老乡的工具后，连排只知赔偿，而未想到赔偿费是否使群众满意。同时，他们所借用的工具，亦不能按时送还（甚至在四月二十一日检查时，还有两件没送还）。有的问题虽反映到连，但没有认真处理，以致造成群众对我们的不满。
    （二）发生的事实如下：损坏手车一辆（坏了四根梁子），镰刀两把，镐头两把，丢失斧头一把，还错铁锹两把；对群众说话态度不好有过两次。
    二、事情处理的情况：
    团在四月十九日晚接到上级政治部的指示，第二天即派民运干事协同一营政治教导员到该连检查，召集各班长了解他们自移驻天坛以来共借过群众那些东西及赔偿损坏东西等情况。知道真实情况与群众所提的意见完全符合。这样，民运干事和政治教导员当即又到当地公安派出所，请其再作详细调查。情况弄清后，团决定对群众赔偿道歉，并以此事实教育全团。
    （一）在该连进行深入教育。二十一日召开该连党的支委扩大会议进行检讨，并由×政委、×副政委参加指导，大家一致认为错误的发生，是由于领导上思想麻痹，没有主动向地方政府联系，并对群众表现了官僚主义的作风，以致严重影响了全军的声誉。这次检查一般尚为深刻，我们根据党委会检讨的精神，在军人大会上作了传达，启发战士对这次违犯纪律的认识。跟着，各班又分别召开班务会进行检讨。
    （二）进行赔偿道歉。二十一日晚，由一营政治教导员和该连政治指导员到派出所召开群众大会。到会的有受损失的物主和附近群众、小组长共四十余人，并有派出所、区人民政府的同志参加。首先，派出所长向群众说明开会的原因，继由该连政治指导员在群众面前作了检讨。政治教导员代表团、营说明领导上对部队群众纪律教育不够，并向群众道歉。最后，他们协同小组长、派出所同志按群众损失的情况，根据群众不吃亏的原则，给群众赔偿了人民币七万七千元。这样处理，群众都很满意。散会后，大家都说：“还是解放军，过去的队伍那能这样？”
    （三）在全团进行教育。该连这次违反群众纪律，系由于领导上疏忽麻痹，以及官僚主义作风所致。事情发生后，他们不予严肃认真处理，以致使我军声誉在群众中受到很大损失。因此，团给该连连长安平指导员苏文波以批评处分；排长吴成章知道损坏了群众东西事先不请示上级处理，直至战士自动以很少代价赔偿后才向上级报告，已在群众中留下坏影响，也给予批评处分；副班长杨金锁、战士王春成借群众东西态度不好，引起群众不满，给以申诫处分。团并准备将这次三连违反纪律的事实通报全团，责成各营委、支部在部队中展开讨论，以提高部队的认识水平，并以认真严肃的态度在本单位进行一次纪律检查。对借物加以清理，如有违反纪律情况，必须进行赔偿、道歉，使我军政治影响不再蒙受损失。
