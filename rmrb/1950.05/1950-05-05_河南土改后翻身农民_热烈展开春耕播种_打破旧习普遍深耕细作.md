　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 29th -- After the land reform and the distribution of land, the vast number of peasants in Baofeng, Jiaxian, Yuxian, Linru, Lushan, Yexian, Xiangcheng and other seven counties in Henan Province have greatly increased their enthusiasm for production and are enthusiastically launching a spring plowing and sowing campaign. The spring land in the above counties has been completely cultivated, and most areas have begun to sow sorghum, millet and other crops; the wheat fields have been hoed one to three times. The area planted with cotton has also increased compared with previous years. Jia County planted more than 30,000 mu of cotton last year, and has now planted more than 45,000 mu of cotton fields. Linru County expects to plant 155,000 mu of cotton this year, and the number of mu that have been sown has reached more than 70 percent.
　　In the spring plowing and sowing campaign, peasants in various places have automatically broken the old habits in rural production in the past and universally carried out deep plowing and fine cultivation. For example, in Xiangcheng County, the depth of plowing in spring was generally only two inches in the past, but now the depth of plowing is about five to seven inches. In the past, wheat in various places was generally hoeed only once, or even not at all, but now it is hoeed two to three times. Liang Erwang, a hired peasant in Liangchong Village, Niutang District, Yu County, began hoeing wheat as early as the fifteenth day of the first lunar month after he was allocated land. Some old people said to him, "It is not auspicious to work the land today." He said, "If it weren't for the Communist Party and the People's Government leading us to turn over, I would have been a farmhand all my life, how could I have my own land to work; now that I have land, I can only work it twice as much and grow more grain to be worthy of Chairman Mao!" In the past, peasants in various parts of Henan Province did not pay much attention to accumulating fertilizer and applying fertilizer. Most peasants only applied fertilizer once a year for two seasons of crops. Now, many farmers have built new toilets, and more people are picking up manure and accumulating mixed fertilizer. For example, in Linru County, the application of fertilizer has increased from three carts of manure per mu in the past to five carts of manure per mu now. Zhang Shuan, a poor peasant in the Second District of Jia County, applied four carts of manure to his one mu of cotton field. In addition, peasants in various places are also actively carrying out water conservancy projects and digging wells to irrigate fields. Jia County has repaired 28 canals and dug one river. The county also plans to repair 72 old wells and dig 691 new wells this year.
　　Several spring rains have fallen in the above-mentioned seven counties this spring, and the peasants' production enthusiasm is even higher when they see the green wheat in the wheat fields they have been allocated. Men, women, old and young in various villages all go to the fields to work, and everywhere presents a new atmosphere of hard work and production. Under the education and promotion of the vast number of peasants, landlords and loafers in various villages have also joined production mutual aid groups to carry out production such as hoeing wheat, plowing fields, and sowing seeds.

　　河南土改后翻身农民
    热烈展开春耕播种
    打破旧习普遍深耕细作
    【新华社汉口二十九日电】河南省宝丰、郏县、禹县、临汝、鲁山、叶县、襄城等七县广大农民，经过土地改革分得土地后，生产积极性空前提高，正热烈展开春耕播种运动。上述各县春地已全部耕完，大部地区并已开始播种高粱、谷子等作物；麦地普遍锄过一遍至三遍。植棉面积也比往年增多。郏县去年种棉三万余亩，今年已播种棉田四万五千余亩，临汝县预计今年种棉十五万五千亩，现已播种的亩数达百分之七十以上。
    在春耕播种运动中，各地农民均自动打破了过去农村生产中的旧习，普遍进行深耕细作。如襄城县过去春耕时犁地一般只有二寸深，现在犁地都在五寸至七寸左右。各地过去麦子一般只锄一遍，甚至有的一遍都不锄，现在都锄到两遍至三遍。禹县牛堂区梁冲村雇农梁二旺分到土地后，早在旧历正月十五就下地锄麦。有些老年人对他说：“今天不兴动土”。他说：“要不是共产党和人民政府领导咱翻了身，当一辈子长工，那能有自己的土动；如今有了土地，只有多动它两次，多打些粮食，才对得起毛主席哩！”河南各地农民过去对积肥和施肥也很不重视，大多数农民一年种两季庄稼却只上一次肥。现在很多农户都新挖了厕所，拾粪和积溷肥的也多了。如临汝县各地施肥由以往的每亩地三车粪增加到现在的五车粪。郏县二区贫农张拴的一亩棉田就上了四车粪。此外，各地农民并积极进行兴修水利，打井浇田。郏县已修好水渠二十八条、挖河一条。该县同时计划在今年一年内修复旧井七十二眼，打新井六百九十一眼。
    上述七县今春普降数次春雨，农民们看到自己分得的麦地绿油油的麦子，生产情绪更高。各村男女老幼齐至田里耕作，到处呈现着一片努力生产的新气象。在广大农民的教育和推动下，各村地主和二流子也都参加了生产互助组，进行锄麦、耕田、播种等生产。
