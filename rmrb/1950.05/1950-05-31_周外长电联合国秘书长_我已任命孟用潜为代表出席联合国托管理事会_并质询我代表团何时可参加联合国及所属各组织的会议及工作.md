Xinhua News Agency, May 30th. Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government, Zhou Enlai, cabled UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie on May 30th, notifying him that the Central People's Government has appointed Meng Yongqian as the representative to attend the UN Trusteeship Council, and pointed out that it is unreasonable for the UN and its affiliated organizations, with the exception of the Universal Postal Union, to still retain the illegal "representatives" of the Chinese Kuomintang reactionary remnant group. He also requested him to reply when the delegation appointed by the Central People's Government can participate in the meetings and work of the UN and its affiliated organizations. The text of the telegram to Lie is as follows:

    Lake Success, New York

    Mr. Trygve Lie, Secretary-General of the United Nations, and please forward to the delegations of all member states of the United Nations and the Trusteeship Council:

    On January 19, 1950, I sent you a note stating that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China had appointed Zhang Wentian as the chief representative of the delegation of the People's Republic of China to attend the United Nations meetings and participate the United Nations work, including the meetings and work of the Security Council. On February 2, 1950, Li Kenong, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, sent you another note stating that the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China had appointed Ji Chaoding as the representative of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations Economic and Social Council. However, to this day, the Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, and other organizations affiliated with the United Nations, with the exception of the Universal Postal Union, still retain the illegal representatives of the Chinese Kuomintang reactionary remnant group, and have not immediately expelled them. I believe this is unreasonable. Now that the UN Trusteeship Council is about to meet on June 1, I hereby notify you again: The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China has appointed Meng Yongqian as the representative of the People's Republic of China to the UN Trusteeship Council. Please forward this to all parties concerned, and please let me know as soon as possible when the only legal delegation of the People's Republic of China appointed by the Central People's Government can participate in the work of the United Nations, and when the representatives attending the United Nations Security Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship Council, and other United Nations bodies can participate in the meetings and work of the relevant bodies.

            Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
                            May 30, 1950, in Beijing

　　周外长电联合国秘书长
    我已任命孟用潜为代表出席联合国托管理事会
    并质询我代表团何时可参加联合国及所属各组织的会议及工作
    【新华社三十日讯】中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长于五月三十日致电联合国秘书长赖伊，通知他，我中央人民政府已任命孟用潜为出席联合国托管理事会的代表，并指出联合国及所属各组织除万国邮政联盟外，迄今仍容留中国国民党反动残余集团的非法“代表”是不合理的。同时请他答复我中央人民政府所任命的代表团何时可以参加联合国及所属各组织的会议及工作。致赖伊电文如下：
    纽约成功湖
    联合国秘书长赖伊先生，并请转达联合国及托管理事会各会员国代表团：
    一九五○年一月十九日，我曾向阁下发出照会，申明中华人民共和国中央人民政府业已任命张闻天为中华人民共和国出席联合国会议和参加联合国工作包括安全理事会的会议及其工作的代表团的首席代表。一九五○年二月二日，中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部李克农副部长又曾向阁下发出照会，申明中华人民共和国中央人民政府业已任命冀朝鼎为中华人民共和国出席联合国经济暨社会理事会的代表。乃时至今日，安全理事会、经济暨社会理事会、及联合国所属其他各组织，除万国邮政联盟外，尚容留中国国民党反动残余集团的非法代表在内，而不将其立即开除出去，我认为这是不合理的。现在联合国托管理事会又将于六月一日开会，我再通知阁下：中华人民共和国中央人民政府业已任命孟用潜为中华人民共和国出席联合国托管理事会的代表，请即转达有关各方，并将中华人民共和国中央人民政府所任命的唯一合法的出席联合国代表团何时可以参加联合国工作，以及出席联合国安全理事会、经济暨社会理事会、托管理事会和联合国其他机构之各代表何时可以参加各有关机构的会议与工作，早日示复为盼。
            中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长  周恩来
                            一九五○年五月三十日于北京
