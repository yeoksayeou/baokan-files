　　Changxindian Women's Literacy Class Reorganized and Officially Opens
    [Our Newspaper] The women's literacy class in Changxindian Town, the 18th district of Beijing suburbs, has been reorganized into a formal women's cultural study class. The students are mainly family members of workers, followed by young women who have dropped out of school. The study time is tentatively set for three years (three semesters each year, four months per semester), equivalent to a senior elementary school graduation level. Students are tested and grouped upon enrollment. They study for two hours a day. The content is mainly based on the cultural textbooks compiled and printed by the Beijing Municipal Spare-time Education Work Committee. Regulations such as promotion and demotion, regular testing, and roll call are also stipulated. In terms of teaching staff, in addition to hiring full-time teachers who are given appropriate subsidies, some teachers from the district's primary schools are also hired to teach voluntarily without affecting their primary work. After preparations were completed, classes officially started on the 24th of last month. There are more than 200 students. (Changxindian Cultural Center Communications Group)
