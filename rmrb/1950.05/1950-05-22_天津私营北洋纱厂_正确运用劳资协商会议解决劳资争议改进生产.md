Tianjin Private Beiyang Yarn Factory
Correctly Uses Labor-Management Consultation Meetings to Resolve Labor Disputes and Improve Production

[This newspaper Tianjin News] Since the establishment of the labor-management consultation meeting and the implementation of democratic management, the Tianjin Private Beiyang Textile Factory has put labor-management relations on the right track, and production has increased month by month.

After the liberation of Tianjin, the factory still used the old unreasonable management system that forced workers to work. The extremely unreasonable wage system in the past has not been changed for a long time, and the workers' enthusiasm for production is not high. Among the factory's 1,500 workers, the average attendance rate (day and night) was less than 70%, the unit output was only about 0.66 pounds, and the quality of the yarn was very low. Last year, twelve labor disputes occurred. This bad situation has now been reversed.

First of all, the trade union clarified the policy of facing production, promoted consultation between the factory and the workers, and solved a number of major labor-management problems that hindered production.

In July last year, in view of the fact that the wage issue had become the main obstacle to production in the factory, the trade union took the initiative to address this issue, and held short-term training classes for workers, systematically conducting education on the policy of benefiting both labor and capital and class education, so that workers established a correct attitude towards wage adjustment. Through the training class, a large number of activists were united, and the Party and the Communist Youth League were established to cultivate strength and lay the foundation for wage adjustment. With the active assistance of the trade union, the labor and management quickly established a wage adjustment evaluation committee, and smoothly changed the unreasonable wage system to a piece-rate wage system based on work, and improved the attendance system and reward and punishment methods. The phenomenon of some workers driving slowly immediately changed. Production gradually increased. The factory began to realize the strength and role of the trade union, and labor-management relations began to change. For example, in January, the average unit output reached 0.793 pounds, an increase of more than 2% compared with last year. In February, under the condition of using inferior cotton, the average unit output was still able to maintain the level of January, which was not the case in the past. In early March, the factory officially established a labor-management consultation meeting, and labor and management jointly consulted on solving problems on the principle of equality. In two months, a total of 15 major proposals were resolved, including the body search system, attendance system, reward and punishment methods, red flag movement, worker welfare canteen, maternity room, and salary advances, which further improved labor-management relations and greatly improved productivity. In March, the average daily output of 20-count yarn was 51.7 pieces, an increase of more than 1.2% compared with February, and the average unit output reached 0.807 pounds, an increase of 5% compared with February; the number of spindles in operation accounted for more than 96.12%. In April, the attendance, reward and punishment systems were further improved, and the red flag movement was launched enthusiastically. Production has increased significantly. The average daily output of 20-count yarn was 56.35 pieces, an increase of 9.57 pieces compared with March, and the average unit output reached 0.865 pounds, an increase of 7.19 pounds compared with March. The highest record reached 0.926 pounds. Zhu Mengsu, the director of the factory, said: "This has never happened before, and it has broken Beiyang's historical production record." Encouraged by the factory director Zhu's enthusiasm for saving raw materials and improving quality for the workers, he arrived at the factory at 5 or 6 in the morning every day to study with the engineers how to properly allocate raw cotton without delaying production. He has clearly realized that democratic management must be implemented in order to improve production. Now, whenever the factory solves a problem, it must first solicit the opinions of the trade union, and conduct discussions in the trade union group to allow everyone to put forward amendments. The factory director said: Labor-management consultation meetings are the most effective way for private factories to solve problems. Preparations must be made before the meeting, and both parties must first exchange proposals. During the meeting, we must focus on solving the central problem. After the meeting, we must check the implementation and not issue blank checks.

　　天津私营北洋纱厂
    正确运用劳资协商会议解决劳资争议改进生产
    【本报天津讯】天津私营北洋纺纱厂自成立劳资协商会议，实行民主管理以来，劳资关系步入正轨，生产量逐月上升。
    天津解放后，该厂仍然沿用旧的强制工人劳动的不合理的管理制度。过去那种极不合理的工资制度，又长期没有改变，工人生产情绪不高。全厂一千五百名工人中，到工率平均（昼夜）不及百分之七十，单位产量仅在○·六六磅左右，纱的质量很低。去年一年中，发生劳资纠纷十二件。这种恶劣情况，现在已经扭转过来了。
    首先，工会明确了面向生产的方针，推动厂方和工人协商，解决了若干有碍生产的劳资间的重大问题。
    去年七月，工会鉴于工资问题成为该厂生产中的主要障碍，即主动抓紧解决这个问题，举办了工人短期训练班，有系统地进行劳资两利政策的教育及阶级教育，使工人对调整工资，树立了正确的态度。通过训练班团结了大批的积极分子，并建党、建团，培养了力量，打下调整工资的基础。在职工会主动的帮助下，劳资双方很快的建立了调整工资评议委员会，很顺利的将不合理的工资制度，改为按劳取酬的计件工资制，又建全了考勤制度和奖惩办法。某些工人开慢车的现象立即改变了。生产日渐提高。厂方开始认识了工会的力量和作用，劳资关系开始有了变化。如一月份，单位平均产量已达○·七九三磅，较去年提高百分之二强，二月份在使用次棉的条件下，单位平均产量仍能保持一月份的水平，这是以往所没有的情况。三月初旬，该厂正式建立劳资协商会议，劳资双方在平等原则上共同协商解决问题。两个月中共解决了搜身制，考勤制度，奖惩办法，红旗运动，工人福利食堂，哺乳室，借支工资等十五条较大提案，使劳资关系进一步改善，生产率更突飞猛进。三月份平均日产二十支纱五一点七件，较二月份提高百分之点二强，单位平均已达○·八○七磅，比二月份提高百分之五；开动纱锭占百分之九十六点一二强。四月份更进一步的健全了考勤、奖惩等制度，热烈地开展了红旗运动。生产更有显著的增加。平均日产二十支纱五六点三五件，比三月份增加百分之九点五七件，单位平均产量已达○·八六五磅。较三月份提高百分之七点一九磅，最高纪录达到○·九二六磅，该厂厂长朱梦苏说：“这是从来没有过的事，打破了北洋历来的生产纪录。”该厂朱厂长为工人节省原料、提高质量的热情所鼓舞，每天早五、六点便到了厂里，和工程师研究如何把原棉配备妥当，不误生产。他已清楚的认识到：必需实行民主管理，才能搞好生产。现厂方每当解决一个问题时，必首先征求工会意见，在工会小组展开讨论，让大家提出修改意见。该厂厂长说：劳资协商会议是私营工厂解决问题最有效的办法，会前必须作准备，双方先交换提案。会中要抓紧解决中心问题。会后要检查执行情况，不开空头支票。
