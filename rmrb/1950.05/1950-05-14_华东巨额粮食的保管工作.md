　　The Storage of Huge Amounts of Grain in East China
　　Special Correspondent Zhou Ziqin
　　Eighty percent of the huge amount of grain transferred to East China has been stored, which is a great achievement. However, how to ensure that this grain will not be lost is a major issue in Shanghai's current grain storage work. The Grain Storage Work Conference convened by the Trade Department of the East China Military and Political Committee put forward the requirement: all grain workers are required to be responsible and ensure that no more grain goes bad. But how can this requirement be achieved? Some comrades said: This year the amount of grain is large, the conditions are poor, and the moisture content is high, and more than 80% will deteriorate! Some proposed: "Let's open a distillery! There is a way to deal with it if it goes bad!" Some proposed: "Some of this huge grain transfer is bound to go bad." Others said: "Many warehouses have corrugated iron roofs, insufficient ventilation, no dunnage, the grain is damp, there are few people, and there is no experience, which are all difficulties." But can these difficulties be overcome?
　　The answer is yes. But great efforts must be made. Everyone must be mobilized in a tense manner, be actively responsible, and give full play to the creativity of the work. If everyone is of one mind and tries every means, the difficulties can definitely be overcome, and it can be ensured that the grain will no longer be lost.
　　What are the specific ways to overcome the difficulties?
　　First, appropriately adjust cadres, strengthen the cadre force, and implement a responsibility system. In addition to transferring a group of cadres with grain work experience to strengthen the work, conduct in-depth ideological mobilization among the current cadres, and everyone is determined to prevent this batch of grain from going bad. Party members and members of the Youth League should take the lead, and everyone should be mobilized, with specific division of labor and clear responsibilities. Then, according to certain manpower and technical conditions, formulate methods for the responsibility system and implement the responsibility system for warehouse management work. In the past, there were two different expressions in the thinking of warehouse managers: one was ideological paralysis, neglecting storage, and even passively waiting, with no solution. The other was that they recognized the importance of storage work, and also worked actively, but they couldn't grasp the key points, didn't know how to use the organizational power to promote the work, were bureaucratic, and the work was passive and coping, lacking comprehensive planning and deployment. They were busy all day long, but the fundamental problems could not be solved. This is the main reason why the grain suffered losses. The other is: feeling that the task is heavy, and if they don't do a good job, there will be problems, so they actively think of ways in their work, are not afraid of hardship, take the initiative to be responsible, are good at promoting everyone to work, and mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of all personnel. This enables the grain to suffer less loss or very little loss. In the future, we must overcome the former bad manifestations, and promote the latter positive manifestations of fighting against difficulties, to ensure the implementation of the responsibility system.
　　Second, a responsibility system should also be implemented in transportation to ensure that the grain is not exposed to rain or moisture. If it goes bad on the road, it should be dealt with immediately on the spot, and no longer transported. Contracts should be signed. Grain should be transported by train in covered wagons. When transporting by ship, check whether the bottom of the ship is leaking. Escort personnel must check, and immediately urge the shipowner to repair it if found. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to carry it again. Rain and waterproof equipment during transportation must be fully prepared in advance. One of the reasons for the grain heating up and becoming moldy now is rain and moisture from leaking ship bottoms. Grain transported from Shanhaiguan suffered rain and mold in December last year. That time, a batch of Northeast rice was transported in. Because it snowed, the grain was not covered properly, and it was wet by the snow. When it was transported to Shanghai, the grain was all frozen into ice. At that time, because the weather was cold, it did not get moldy after being frozen. After sorting it out, the damage was not great. However, it still did not attract serious attention, resulting in the repetition of past mistakes in this grain transportation, and a serious loss of more than 300,000 catties of grain was caused by rain and mold. As for the matter of grain becoming moldy due to leaking ship bottoms, it happens in almost every batch of grain transportation. Therefore, a responsibility system for transportation must be implemented to ensure that the grain will no longer suffer any undue losses during the grain transfer.
　　Third, increase warehouse capacity so that 40% of the grain in the existing warehouses can be removed, so as to leave ventilation channels, reduce pile sizes, and leave enough space for spreading to dry when it gets hot. The construction of dunnage and ventilation equipment should also be expedited. The turning of warehouses should be combined with warehouse management work. Turning warehouses can only solve the problem temporarily. After turning, it will still get hot. Turning it over and over will rot the grain. It not only wastes manpower and material resources, but also still cannot achieve the purpose of preserving grain. Therefore, blowing, drying, and other equipment must be established. Before the construction of the foreign fans is completed, the universal installation of electric local fans can also solve part of the problem.
　　Furthermore, strengthen the cadre force in special warehouses, and improve the leasing of special warehouses, not according to quantity but according to area or cubic meters. When the grain is transferred to Shanghai, although great efforts are made to prepare warehouses, it is still considered insufficient, resulting in a general excess of the required capacity, causing congestion inside the warehouses, too few ventilation channels, and pile sizes that do not meet the standards. For example, the general standard for grain piles should be eight sacks high, but now there are piles as high as sixteen or seventeen sacks. There are as many as four thousand sacks in one pile, and there is no place to spread them out to dry after they get hot. The special warehouses are particularly serious. These warehouses were not originally used for storing grain, so they have no ventilation equipment or places to turn and dry the grain. In addition, some warehouses also contain things like white sugar and salt, which is even more unfavorable for grain storage and easily causes steaming damage. If reforms are not carried out immediately, the grain will inevitably continue to heat up and become moldy, resulting in major losses. At the same time, when signing contracts, warehouse owners only take responsibility for quantity but not quality because they can charge more rent for storing one more bag, making the warehouses even more congested.
　　Fourth, it is recommended that the central government uniformly stipulate national grain standards, stipulating that the moisture content of grain: generally 12% to 13% is best to meet storage requirements. If natural conditions or poor processing equipment (no moisture testing equipment, etc.) are taken into account, more rice or brown rice can be transported, and in the long-term transfer in the future, all brown rice should be transported. At the same time, strictly manage processing plants and strictly prohibit adding water and impurities during processing. Among the grains that heated up and became moldy this time, the moisture content was too high, and the baking equipment was insufficient, resulting in a loss of about 90,000 catties. Now the baking towers are working day and night, specializing in baking grain with a moisture content of 15% to 17%. Twenty-four hours can only bake 1,500 shi. In addition, the grain depots are scattered and too far away, and the transportation back and forth is also a big problem. In the future, although more baking can be done after the number of baking towers is increased, it is always better to reduce the moisture content as much as possible to save manpower and financial resources.
　　In addition, establishing various systems, solving problems in a timely manner, issuing quick reports, specifically reporting on grain storage conditions, exchanging storage methods and experiences, and combining them with reward and punishment systems, commending those who are responsible and criticizing and punishing those who are derelict in their duties are also effective methods to ensure grain storage work.

　　华东巨额粮食的保管工作
    本报特派记者　周子芹
    华东调运巨额粮食，已有百分之八十入库，这是很大的成绩。但如何保证这些粮食不再遭受损失，是当前上海粮食保管工作中的重大问题。这次华东军政委员会贸易部召开的粮食保管工作会议上，就提出：要求全体粮食工作人员，大家负责，保证不再坏粮食。但如何才能实现这个要求呢？有些同志就说：今年粮食数量大，条件差，水份重，百分之八十以上的都要变质！有的提出：“开个酒精厂吧！坏了也有办法处理！”有的提出：这样巨大的粮食调运，“总是要坏些的”。有的还说：“许多仓库，洋铁瓦，通风不足，没垫仓板，粮食潮，人员少，没经验，都是困难。”但这些困难是否可以克服呢？
    答复是肯定的。但必须作很大的努力。必须大家都紧张的动员起来，积极负责，高度发挥工作的创造性，上下一心，想尽各种办法，就一定可以克服困难，作到粮食不再受到损失。
    克服困难的具体办法是什么呢？
    第一、适当调整干部，增强干部力量，实行负责制。除调一批有粮食工作经验的干部加强工作外，在目前干部中进行深入的思想动员，大家齐下决心，不准这批粮食再坏下去。以党员和青年团员带头，全体一致都动起来，具体分工，明确责任。然后根据一定的人力和技术条件，定出责任制度的办法，实行仓库保管工作的负责制。过去，在仓库管理人员的思想上，有两种不同的表现：一种是思想麻痹，轻视保管。甚至消极等待，没有办法。有的则是认识到了保管工作的重要，也积极努力工作，但抓不住重点，不知道利用组织力量推动工作，事务主义，工作被动、应付，缺乏全面计划和布置。一天忙到晚，根本问题仍然不能解决。这是使粮食受到捐失的主要原因。另一种是：感到任务重，不好好干就要出问题，因而在工作上积极想办法，不怕吃苦，主动负责，善于推动大家来工作，发动全体人员的积极性和创造性。这使粮食能够少受损失或损失很小。今后必须克服前一种坏的表现，而发扬后一种积极向困难作斗争的表现，保证负责制的贯彻。
    第二、在运输中也要实行负责制。保证粮食不淋雨，不受潮。万一路上坏了，就在当地立时处理，不再运来。要订立合同。火车运粮要用棚车。船运时，要检查船底是否漏水。押运人员一定要检查，发现后立即督促船主修理。否则不再允其载运。运输途中的防雨、防水设备，一定要事先充分作好准备。现在发现的粮食发热霉烂的原因之一，就是淋雨和船底漏水着潮。山海关运粮遭受雨淋霉烂已在去年十二月发生过一次。那次运进一批东北大米，因遇到下雪，粮食没有盖好，被雪水淋湿，运到上海后，粮食全部结成了冰块，当时因天气冷，冻了也不发霉，经整理后，损坏不大。但仍未引起严重注意，致在这次运粮中，依然重复过去错误，又被雨水淋湿而发生了三十多万斤粮食霉烂的严重损失。至于因船底漏水而使粮食发霉的事情，却几乎是每批运粮中都有。因而必须实行运输的负责制，以保证粮食在调粮途中不再遭受任何不应有的损失。
    第三、增加仓库容量，使现有仓库粮食得以疏出百分之四十，以便留出通风道，减小堆桩，并留出足够摊晾的地方，以便在发热时摊晾。垫仓板和通风设备的建设也应力求迅速。并将翻仓和仓库管理工作结合起来。翻仓只能暂时解决问题，翻了之后还会发热，翻来翻去粮食就烂了。不但浪费人力物力，而且仍不能达到保存粮食的目的。因此必须建立吹风、干燥等设备。洋风车未建好前，普遍的装置用电力的土风车，也可以解决一部分问题。
    再就是加强特约仓库的干部力量，改进特约仓库的租用，不按数量而按面积或立方米，粮食在调运到达上海时，虽大力准备仓库，但究竟还嫌不够，以致一般超过了应有容量，造成仓库内部拥塞不堪，通风道太少，而堆桩也不合标准。如一般标准，粮食堆桩应该是高八个麻袋，但现在有高到十六、七个麻袋的。堆桩上，一堆有多到四千袋的，发热后就没有摊晾的地方。尤其严重的是特约仓库。这种仓库原来就不是储藏粮食用的仓库，所以没有通风设备，也没有翻晒粮食的地方，加上有的仓库内还放有白糖、食盐等东西，致对粮食保管更加不利。易于蒸坏。如不立即加以改革，则必致粮食继续发生发热霉烂而损失重大。同时在订合同时，仓库主因为多存一袋就可以多收一袋的租金，所以只负责数量，未保证质量，使仓库更形拥塞。
    第四、建议中央统一规定全国粮食标准，规定粮食含水量：最合乎保管要求的一般以百分之十二到十三为好，如照顾到自然条件或加工设备差（没有化验水份设备等）的地区，可以多运稻谷或糙米，并在今后长期调运中，做到全部运糙米。同时要严格管理加工场，严格禁止加工时掺水掺杂。这次发热霉烂的粮食中，含水量太大，烘烤设备又不够，致损失达九万斤左右。现在烘塔日夜开工，专门烤烘含水份百分之十五到百分之十七的粮食，二十四小时，也只能烘到一千五百石。加以粮库分散，距离太远，来往搬运也是很大问题。将来增加烘塔后，虽可多烘，但总不如尽量减少含水量的节省人力财力。
    此外，建立各种制度，及时解决问题，出快报，专门报道粮食保管情况，交流保管办法与经验，并结合奖惩制度，表扬尽责的批评和处分失职的人员，也是有力保证保管粮食工作的方法之一。
