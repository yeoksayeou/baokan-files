A Letter from an Immigrant

To the Jining County People's Government:

　　I was originally a citizen of the Second Inner District of Beijing. This time, with the assistance of the government, I moved to Suiyuan. The Beijing Municipal People's Government issued generous food and cartage allowances; and Comrade Lin, a cadre of the county government, went to Beijing to pick us up, which made those of us who were unemployed feel extremely excited to come to Pingdiquan (i.e., Jining County), a fertile plain with abundant agricultural products. After boarding the train, we were cared for and escorted by Comrade Lin, the chief leader, and tenderly looked after by Doctor Lü, which made every immigrant feel the government's love for the people. When the train passed Datong County, the comrades of the station's trade union even gave us a lot of food. I don't know how to thank them enough! After arriving at our destination, we were warmly welcomed and properly settled by the local government, and we were assigned to nearby rural areas to cultivate cultivated land. Such earnest care was beyond the expectations of every immigrant. From now on, we can only work hard and step up production to make our vast area prosperous and flourishing. I would like to express my deepest respect to the government and the comrade cadres.

　　一封移民的信集宁县人民政府：
    我原是北京内二区的市民，此次受到政府的援助，移居绥远。京市人民政府发给很充裕的伙食费马车费；并蒙县府干部林同志去北京接我们，使失业的人能来到土地肥沃、农产丰富的平地泉（即集宁县），真感到十二分的兴奋。上火车后，有总领队林同志问寒问暖、护送，及医师吕大夫的亲切照顾，使每个移民都感到政府对人民的爱护。火车过大同县时，该车站职工会诸同志还馈送很多食物给我们。不知要怎样感谢才好！到达目的地后，又受到当地政府的热烈欢迎和妥善安置，把我们分到较近的农村去种熟地。这样恳切的照顾，真出了每个移民的意想之外。今后惟有努力劳动，加紧生产，使我们这广大的地区富庶繁荣起来。谨向政府及干部同志致最深切的敬意。
