　　Moldy Cotton Seeds Loaned to Farmers
　　Yan Yisheng Dismissed and Investigated
    Yan Yisheng, the director of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative of the Third District of Shulu, Hebei Province, failed to properly store cotton seeds. After it rained on April 16th, 59,000 jin of cotton seeds were soaked and became moldy. These 59,000 jin of cotton seeds were a mixture of grade B, C, and D cotton seeds and some red cotton seeds, and the quality was extremely poor (last year, Nan Chenwei Oil Mill took some to press oil, but refused them due to the poor quality). The county supply and marketing cooperative, in order to support the masses in planting cotton, instructed the branch cooperative on April 17th to loan cotton seeds to the masses. Yan Yisheng, in order to take the opportunity to make money, only loaned out a portion of the grade A seeds, and deliberately loaned out these 59,000 jin of bad cotton seeds. The masses in Xiaofeng, Dafeng, Xiaobai Dian, Zhong Wangzhuang, Zhang Gu Zhuang, and Beisi Village borrowed 6,454.5 jin. When they tested the germination rate, only two or three out of ten cotton seeds sprouted. Some of the masses did not test the germination rate and planted them in the ground, but no seedlings grew. When borrowing the cotton seeds, the masses in Xiaobai Dian saw that they were bad cotton seeds and asked to borrow good ones, but the supply and marketing cooperative did not allow it and forced them to borrow the bad seeds. The masses reflected, "Is the supply and marketing cooperative supporting our production? It is simply asking the farmers to ruin the land!" After the organization minister of the Shulu County Party Committee discovered this matter, he questioned Yan Yisheng, who insisted on his mistake and refused to admit it. Later, the worker in charge of the cotton seeds testified, and the masses brought the bad cotton seeds to confront him, and he finally admitted it. The Shulu County People's Government's handling of this issue was: stop lending out the bad cotton seeds, replace the bad cotton seeds loaned to farmers with good cotton seeds, and apologize to the farmers. With the approval of the commissioner's office, Yan Yisheng has been given the punishment of dismissal and investigation. Yan Yisheng's vile behavior of only caring about making money and deceiving the farmers affected the cotton planting task and damaged the government's prestige among the masses. The Shulu County People's Government's punishment and handling of Yan is necessary and correct. Since Yan Yisheng became the director of the Third District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, he has deceived the masses several times, such as adding water when lending sesame cakes and using small scales (shorting two jin per hundred jin). The masses reflected that the supply and marketing cooperative was a "scam cooperative." After the county discovered this problem, although it was dealt with (supplementing the masses with sesame cakes), Yan Yisheng was not given the necessary education and punishment. The county leadership should also conduct a review. By the end of April, although the 59,000 jin of cotton seeds had been stopped from being loaned out, they were still piled up and continuing to rot. If they are not taken care of, they cannot even be used for oil pressing. It is hoped that the county will quickly deal with them to avoid greater losses.

### 霉烂棉籽贷给农民　阎毅生被撤职查办

　　霉烂棉籽贷给农民
　　阎毅生被撤职查办
    河北省束鹿三区供销分社主任阎毅生，不好好保管棉籽，四月十六日下了雨后，使五万九千斤棉籽被雨淋湿霉烂。这五万九千斤棉籽，本是乙、丙、丁三级棉籽和一部红棉籽混合，质量极坏（去年南陈位油坊拉了一部分去打油，嫌坏没有要）。县供销社为了扶植群众种棉，四月十七日指示该分社贷给群众棉籽。阎毅生为了乘机赚钱，甲级种籽只贷出一部，便故意出贷这五万九千斤坏棉籽，小冯、大冯、小白店、中王庄、张古庄、北四村群众贷了六千四百五十四斤半，试了试发芽率，十个棉籽只有二、三个出芽。有的群众没试验发芽率，种到地里，长不出苗来。在贷棉籽时，小白店群众见是坏棉籽，要求贷好的，供销社不允许，强迫人家贷了坏籽。群众纷纷反映说：“供销社那是扶植咱们生产？简直是叫庄稼人糟踏地呢！”束鹿县委组织部长发觉这事以后，曾追问阎毅生，阎坚持错误，不承认这回事。后来经管棉籽的工人证明，群众又把坏棉籽拿来对质，他才承认了。束鹿县人民政府对这个问题的处理是：坏棉籽停止出贷，用好棉籽换回贷给农民的坏棉籽，并向农民道歉。经过专署批准，已给阎毅生撤职查办处分。阎毅生这种只管赚钱，欺骗农民的恶劣行为，影响了种棉任务，损害了政府在群众中的威信，束鹿县人民政府对阎的处分和处理，是必要和正确的。自阎毅生当三区供销分社主任以来，数次欺骗群众，如贷麻饼时掺水，用小秤（每百斤少二斤）。群众反映该供销社是“坑人社”。县发觉这个问题后，虽然作了处理（补给群众麻饼），但没给阎毅生以必要的教育和处分。县领导上亦应作检讨。到四月底，五万九千斤棉籽虽已停止出贷，但还堆着继续霉烂，如再不管，打油也不能用了，希望县方迅速处理，以免遭受更大的损失。
