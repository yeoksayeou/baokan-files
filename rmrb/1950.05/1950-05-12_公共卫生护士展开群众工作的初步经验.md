　　Preliminary Experiences of Public Health Nurses in Developing Mass Work
　　Cai Hengfang

    The most important significance of commemorating Nurses' Day is to review the shortcomings of past work, determine the content of current work, and establish the direction of future work. I would like to express some of my immature opinions on this year's "May 12th," which can also be said to be some of the experiences I have learned in the public health nursing work at the First Health Center.
    In the past, most of the work was copying a set of foreign public health nursing work to suit our Chinese needs, which was neither economical nor practical. However, in the national system and social reality of that time, it was not easy to take into account the problem of adapting to reality. Public health nurses of that era found that they were more capable of doing mass work, not afraid of getting dirty, not afraid of getting tired, and working without distinguishing between rich and poor, or high and low. For example, nursing, publicity, and education during home visits were obviously a kind of mass work, but this kind of work was not deep enough. Since liberation, learning has been strengthened, and political awareness has gradually improved. The analysis of problems has become more objective, and we have come to understand some truly people-serving viewpoints. At the same time, we can criticize the shortcomings of past work and determine the direction of current work.
    We should clearly recognize that the object of our service is the broad masses of the working people. Under the leadership of the Health Bureau, the First Health Center is responsible for the health care work in one district of Beijing. The nursing work has also shifted from being based on households to being based on districts. In this way, the scope of our work has become much wider. The district nursing team began to plan how to follow the mass line and how to organize in mid-March of this year, so that the work can be further deepened into the masses. After several reviews of the work, the content and methods of future work have been corrected. There are fifteen police stations in Inner District One, together with the Dong'an Market Police Station, totaling sixteen stations. Each section police station is responsible for recommending one health team leader for every ten house numbers. The existing district nurses in the First Health Center are responsible for promoting and coordinating the health work in this district to achieve the goal of comprehensive health care, and to enlighten the power of the masses and improve the people's awareness of health knowledge according to their needs. The meetings of health team leaders in each section have already begun. For the convenience of the working people, the meeting times are all scheduled in the evening, so the team leaders attending are very enthusiastic, with about forty to one hundred people attending each time. The content of the meeting is mostly to discuss specific opinions on health work in the future. The team leaders in each section are extremely enthusiastic and put forward many opinions, such as: "We hope that the comrades of the First Health Center will often instill us with some health knowledge." "After liberation, the government has taken care of the people's interests everywhere, and I hope that the comrades of the office will often contact us." "This is everyone's business, we must assist the team members to carry out health work very well." "Convene mass meetings to talk to them about health." Various proposals; some sections, after discussing the progress of the work, the comrades of the police station and the health team leaders are also very enthusiastic about promoting the work. At present, the second, sixth, seventh, ninth, tenth, eleventh, twelfth sections and Dong'an Market Police Station have been organized successively, and the introduction of smallpox vaccination and maternal and child health network, and the publicity of BCG, typhoid fever prevention and summer hygiene have all achieved remarkable results. Other sections are also in progress and organization. Although this initial mass work sometimes encounters some difficulties, it is also easy to overcome. In this short period of time, a great harvest can be obtained, which makes the nurses more clearly realize that the direction of the work is undoubtedly on the right path. Public health education must have correct political leadership and follow the mass line, and organized mobilization work can achieve results.
    Due to this preliminary experience, it proves that the future development of work should be further deepened into the people. Of course, nurses should have more substantial preparations in terms of ideology and technology. The work locations of the nurses in each section are in the center of each district, so that the nurses in charge of each section can integrate with the people in terms of life. They are responsible for contacting all health work in this section, and hope that each district nurse can become a propagandist, organizer and leader of mass health work, and become a bridge between the people and health administration.

　　公共卫生护士展开群众工作的初步经验
　　蔡蘅芳
    纪念护士节最重要的意义，是检讨过去工作的缺点，确定现在工作的内容，和建立将来工作的方向。我愿意在本年的“五一二”来表达我一些不成熟的意见，也可以说是我在第一卫生所做公共卫生护理工作中学习的一点经验。
    以往的工作，多半是抄录外国公共卫生护理工作的一套，来配合我们中国的需要，既不经济，又不实际。可是在那时候的国家制度和社会现实情况，绝不容易顾到配合实际的问题，那个时代的公共卫生护士们，曾发现他们比较是能做群众工作的人员，既不怕脏，又不怕累，工作起来亦不分贫富，不分贵贱，例如做家庭访视时的护理，宣传及教育等工作，很明显的这也是一种群众工作，但这种工作是不够深入的。自从解放以后，学习加强了，政治觉悟也逐渐提高了，对于问题的分析比较客观了，才明白一些真正为人民服务的观点，同时才能批评以往工作上的缺点，及确定现在工作的方向。
    我们服务的对象应当认明是广大的劳动群众，第一卫生所由卫生局领导之下，负责北京市内一区的保健工作，护理方面的工作，也就从以家庭为单位而转变以地段为单位，这样，我们工作的范围就广大得多了，地段护理组自本年三月中旬就开始计划如何走群众路线，如何组织起来，可以使工作更进一步的深入群众。经过几次检讨工作后，改正了今后工作的内容及进行的方法，内一区共有十五个派出所，连同东安市场派出所共计十六所。各段派出所负责由每十个门牌推举卫生小组长一人。第一卫生所现有的地段护士分别担任推动及联系本区卫生工作以达到全面保健的目标，并启发群众的力量，根据需要，提高人民对于卫生知识的觉悟。各段卫生小组长会议已经开始了，为了劳动人民的方便。会议时间都规定在晚间举行，所以到会的小组长非常踊跃，每次到会的约有四五十至一百人之多，会议内容多为商讨今后对于卫生工作的具体意见，各段小组长情绪极为浓厚，提出意见很多，例如：“我们希望第一卫生所的同志常灌输我们些卫生知识。”“解放后，政府对于人民的利益处处都顾到了，希望事务所同志经常和我们联系。”“这是我们大家的事，我们一定要协助组员们对于卫生工作很好的展开。”“召集群众大会给他们讲讲卫生。”种种的提议；有的段上经过讨论工作进展后，派出所同志和卫生小组长对于推动工作方面，也非常热心。现在第二段，第六段，第七段，第九段，第十段，第十一段，第十二段及东安市场派出所已先后组织起来，进行了种牛痘，妇幼卫生工作网的介绍，并宣传卡介苗，伤寒预防及夏令卫生等，都得到了显著的效果。其他各段也正在进行及组织中。这初次的群众工作虽然有时遇到些困难，但是也很容易克服。在这短短的时间内，能够得到很大的收获，使护士们更明确的认识到工作的方向无疑的是走向正确的道路了。公共卫生教育必须有正确的政治领导与走群众路线，有组织的发动工作才能收到效果。
    由于这一点初步的经验，证明将来工作的发展当更进一步的深入民间。当然护士们在思想上和技术上应当有更充实的准备，各段护士的工作地点就在每一地段的中心，这样，各段负责护士在生活方面才能和人民大众打成一片，他们要负责联系本段的一切卫生工作，希望每个地段护士都能成为群众卫生工作的宣传者、组织者及领导者，成为人民与卫生行政中间的桥梁。
