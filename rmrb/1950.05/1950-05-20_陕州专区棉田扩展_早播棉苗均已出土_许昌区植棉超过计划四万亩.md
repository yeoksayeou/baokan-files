　　Expansion of Cotton Fields in Shanzhou Special District
　　Early-Sown Cotton Seedlings Have Emerged
　　Xuchang Area Plants 40,000 Mu More Cotton Than Planned
    [Report from this newspaper in Zhengzhou] In the cotton-producing areas of Shanxian, Lingbao, and Wenxiang in Henan Province, cotton fields have been greatly expanded under the vigorous leadership of governments at all levels, which have helped cotton farmers solve difficulties in production materials. At the same time, the Lingbao branch of the Cotton Yarn & Fabric Company and the Shanzhou Special District Trading Company have coordinated to purchase large quantities of cotton, solving the difficulty of selling cotton. The production enthusiasm of cotton farmers in various places is high, and they are generally increasing the planting of cotton fields on a large scale. All cotton fields have now been sown. According to statistics from the governments of these three counties, a total of 415,140 mu of cotton have been planted this year, an increase of more than 22 percent compared with the planting area of 320,170.4 mu last year. This exceeds the task assigned by the special commissioner's office to increase cotton fields in these three counties by 82,000 mu.
    On the 22nd of last month, the Shanzhou Special Commissioner's Office held an emergency meeting on cotton planting work and issued an emergency mobilization order to increase cotton fields. It stipulated that April 23 to May 3 would be a concentrated ten-day period for cotton planting. Subsequently, the Shanxian, Lingbao, and Wenxiang county governments convened meetings of district and township cadres to clarify the importance of leading and completing the cotton planting task ideologically. At the same time, the Lingbao branch of the state-owned Cotton Yarn & Fabric Company and the Shanzhou Special District Trading Company established cotton purchasing stations in the cities of Shanxian, Lingbao, and Wenxiang, respectively. They purchased large quantities of cotton at a ratio of one to seven for cotton and wheat. From April 24 to May 2, in ten days, they exchanged 200,6246 jin of cotton stored by cotton farmers, paying out 1,012,922 jin of wheat. This solved the difficulties of cotton farmers in the past who could not sell their stored cotton and suffered losses due to the low cotton price ratio. The special commissioner's office and various county governments have transferred a large number of cadres and mobilized students to assist in the work in districts and townships.
    The Provincial Department of Agriculture allocated 1,000 sprayers, 100,000 jin of cotton oil soap, and other medicinal powders specifically for the prevention and control of cotton pests and diseases. They also used accounting methods to make the masses realize that growing cotton is better than growing grain. At a mass meeting in Jiankou Township, Guozhen District, Lingbao, agricultural association member Lu Ziyou calculated that he had grown one mu of cotton in paddy fields last year, harvested 80 jin, which could be exchanged for 560 jin of wheat at a ratio of one to seven for cotton and wheat. The 160 jin of cotton seeds harvested could be exchanged for 80 jin of wheat, totaling 640 jin of wheat. If this mu were used to grow grain, the autumn and summer harvests would only yield 410 jin. After specific accounting, the masses in the township decided to increase cotton fields by 66.7 mu that day; many farmers changed the fields originally planned for planting millet and corn to cotton. The township increased cotton fields by a total of 157 mu. In Potou and Zhongwang, two natural villages in the Third District of Wenxiang County, households without livestock helped households with livestock plow the land. Two man-days were exchanged for one ox-day. More than 200 farmers and 131 head of livestock organized ten mutual aid teams, solving the farming difficulties of 30 poor farmers without livestock. From April 23 to 28, in six days, they rushed to plant 1,577.5 mu of cotton fields in the two villages.
    Due to the vigorous leadership of governments at all levels, which solved the difficulties of the masses in planting cotton, the production enthusiasm of cotton farmers in the three counties has been high, and they have generally planted cotton on a large scale. Wenxiang County planted more than 97,100 mu of cotton last year, and this year it planted more than 114,100 mu, an increase of more than 17,100 mu compared with last year. By the end of April, all sowing had been completed. The earliest sown cotton (in places like Daziying) has seedlings that have emerged by one inch. Last year, Lingbao Guozhen planted 18,100 mu of cotton, and this year it plans to plant more than 31,300 mu, an increase of 75.7 percent over last year's cotton planting area. As of April 30, 80 percent of the cotton fields in the town had been sown. Last year, Shanxian Chengguan District planted 1,502 mu of cotton, and this year it planted 2,381 mu, an increase of 879 mu compared with last year. (Sai)
    [Report from Zhengzhou] In Baofeng, Jiaxian, Linru, Lushan, Yexian, Yuxian, and Xiangcheng, seven counties in the Xuchang Special District that have completed land reform, cotton planting has been increased under the leadership of the people's government, exceeding the original cotton increase plan. After the Xuchang Special Commissioner's Office production meeting in March, in order to seriously implement the cotton increase plan, the special commissioner's office determined Jia, Linru, and Yu counties as key counties for cotton planting, lending more than 140,000 jin of high-quality cotton seeds. Through widespread publicity among the peasant masses at all levels, they called for increasing cotton planting. Under the slogan of "Work hard to produce and have food and clothing," the turned-over peasants in various places actively carried out increased cotton planting. As of the end of April, cotton fields in various places have been successively sown. According to incomplete statistics, 451,800 mu of cotton fields have been sown in the seven counties, an increase of 100,000 mu compared with the cotton planting acreage last year, exceeding one and a half times the district's task of increasing cotton by 40,000 mu.

　　陕州专区棉田扩展
　　早播棉苗均已出土
　　许昌区植棉超过计划四万亩
    【本报郑州讯】河南省著名产棉区陕县、灵宝、阌乡棉田，经各级人民政府大力领导种植，帮助棉农解决生产资料困难；同时花纱布公司灵宝分公司和陕州专区贸易公司，配合大量收购棉花，解决棉花销路困难，各地棉农生产情绪高涨，普遍大量增植棉田。现全部棉田已播种完毕。据该三县人民政府统计，今年共植棉花四十一万五千一百四十亩，较去年植棉面积三十二万零一百七十亩四分，增加百分之二十二强。超过专署布置该三县增植棉田八万二千亩的任务。
    上月二十二日，陕州专署召开了植棉工作紧急会议，并发布增植棉田紧急动员令。规定四月二十三日至五月三日为植棉突击旬后，陕县、灵宝、阌乡三县人民政府即召开了区、乡干部会议，使干部思想上明确领导完成植棉任务的重要性。同时国营花纱布公司灵宝支公司和陕州专区贸易公司在陕、灵、阌三县城，分别设立棉花收购站。以棉、麦一换七的比价，大量收购棉花。四月二十四日到五月二日十天中，已换购棉农存棉二十万零六千二百四十六斤。付出小麦一百零一万二千九百二十二斤，解决了过去棉农存棉卖不出去，及棉花比价低棉农吃亏的困难。专署及各县政府均抽调大批干部及动员学生到区乡协助工作。
    省农业厅拨去一千具喷雾器，十万斤棉油皂及其他药粉，专供防治棉花病虫害。并用算账方式，使群众认识到种棉花比种粮食强。灵宝虢镇区涧口乡群众大会上，农会会员卢子友算一算自己去年种一亩水田的棉花，摘了八十斤，按棉、麦一比七计算，可换小麦五百六十斤，所收花籽一百六十斤可换小麦八十斤，共换小麦六百四十斤，这一亩如种粮食，秋夏两季不过收获四百一十斤。经过具体算账，该乡群众当天便决定增植棉田六十六亩七分；许多农民把原来打谱种谷子、包谷的田地改种棉花。该乡共增植棉田一百五十七亩。阌乡县三区坡头、中王两自然村无牲口户，帮助有牲口户犁地，两个人工换一个牛工，二百多个农民，一百三十一头牲口组织了十个互助组，解决了三十户没牲口贫农的耕种困难。从二十三日到二十八日六天中，突击种完了两村一千五百七十七亩半的棉田。
    由于各级人民政府的大力领导，解决了群众种棉中的困难，三县棉农生产情绪高涨，普遍大量种植棉花。阌乡县去年种棉九万七千一百余亩，今年植棉十一万四千一百余亩，较去年增植一万七千一百余亩。到四月底止，已全部播种完毕。最先播种的棉花（大字营等地），幼苗已出土寸许。灵宝虢镇去年植棉一万八千一百亩，今年计划植棉三万一千三百多亩，较去年植棉面积增加百分之七五点七。到四月三十日止，该镇百分之八十的棉田已完成播种。陕县城关区去年植棉一千五百零二亩，今年植棉二千三百八十一亩，较去年增加八百七十九亩。 （塞）
    【郑州讯】河南许昌专区完成土改的宝丰、郏县、临汝、鲁山、叶县、禹县、襄城七县在人民政府领导下，纷纷增种棉花，超过了原订增棉计划。三月份许昌专署生产会议之后，该专署为了认真贯彻增棉计划，确定郏、临汝、禹三县为植棉重点县，贷放优良棉种十四万余斤。通过各界代表会在农民群众中广泛进行宣传，号召增种棉花。各地翻身农民在“努力生产有吃穿”的口号下，积极进行增种棉花。截至四月底，各地棉田均已先后下种，据不完全统计，七县下种棉田达四十五万一千八百余亩，较去年植棉亩数增加十万亩。超过全专区增棉任务四万亩的一倍半。
