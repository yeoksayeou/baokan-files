Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 8th: Since the land reform in Northeast China's rural areas, a large number of labor models have emerged. Since last year, the people's governments of the five provinces of Heilongjiang, Liaodong, Jilin, Rehe, and Liaoxi have rewarded 2,337 labor models. Among them, in addition to models of mutual aid work teams, the emergence of a large number of models for improving agricultural technology is most noteworthy.

	Improving Farming Methods
In terms of improving farming methods, Wang Guoman, a labor model from Kuandian County, Liaodong Province, created a record of increasing production by 400% compared to the average annual yield by improving the soil quality and farming methods. Li Jianxuan, a farmer from Dayangou Village, Zhuanghe County, created the "intercropping with topdressing" planting method, planting three kinds of crops on one piece of land at the same time, resulting in a harvest three times higher than the average yield. Jin Junxi, a special-class labor model from Songjiang Province, successfully cultivated cotton at 44 degrees 01 minutes north latitude in Ning'an County, harvesting 182 jin of seed cotton per mu, which is 62 jin more than the average yield per mu in the Liaodong and Liaoxi areas of southern Manchuria. This fact broke the "theory" of past puppet Manchurian agricultural experts that cotton could not be grown north of 43 degrees 40 minutes north latitude, indicating that cotton cultivation in Northeast China could gradually move northward. Zhao Xiangying, a first-class labor model from Jilin Province, successfully experimented with a rice warm-bed seedling raising method, which allows rice seedlings to be transplanted half a month earlier even when the temperature is very low, and late-maturing varieties can also be sown, while the harvest is 74% higher than that of general broadcasting and transplanting methods.

	Improving Farm Tools
Farmers in various parts of Northeast China have also made significant achievements in improving farm tools. Since the land reform, many farmers, in order to increase the yield of the land that has now become their own, have independently studied diligently and experimented repeatedly, creating many effective improved farm tools. In Heilongjiang Province alone, 23 kinds of seeders, weeding machines, and improved plows and harrows have emerged. Fan Zhensheng of Gaiping County, Liaodong Province, created an improved harrow that saves three laborers per hectare of land compared to the old-fashioned harrow. Xu Youcai, a farmer from Nehe County, created a seeder that can sow 15 mu of land per day with one person and two horses, saving three man-days and one horse-day compared to sowing the same area of land with an old wooden plow.

	Improving Varieties
In terms of improving crop varieties, Wang Zhengnian, a farmer from Panshan County, Liaoxi Province, adopted the method of grafting cotton seedlings onto kenaf seedlings, and then pollinating cotton and kenaf flowers, to cultivate a new cotton variety. This new cotton seed has better drought and flood resistance than the best original variety in Northeast China, "Guannong No. 1," and it does not require topping or pruning during its growth period. This "Guannong No. 1" saves one-third of the labor, and the yield is also one-quarter higher than "Guannong No. 1," with each plant able to bear ten bolls. Farmers in Andong and Xinjin counties, Liaodong Province, created a corn hybridization method, which greatly improved the quality of corn and increased the yield by 20 to 30 percent, and also enhanced the ability of corn to resist diseases, with the proportion of smut disease reduced to 3 percent.

	Preventing and Controlling Pests and Diseases
In terms of preventing and controlling pests and diseases, farmers in various places have also invented many practical and effective methods. Pan Guoyi, a farmer from Andong County, invented the use of stinky oil to kill mud-encased worms last year, which resulted in his insect-infested rice still maintaining a yield of 500 jin per mu.

The various improved agricultural technology experiments and creations of the farmers in the above-mentioned areas of Northeast China have all been successful with the direct assistance of the people's government. Wang Zhengnian, the farmer who created the new cotton variety, began experimenting with new cotton seeds in 1933, but when he was able to plant six mu of land with the new cotton seeds in 1944, the cotton seeds were forcibly taken away by the Japanese invaders, causing a heavy blow to his long-term painstaking research. It was not until the spring of 1949 (the first year after liberation) that the people's government called for cotton planting, and he found a little remaining cotton seed and planted a small piece of land. This immediately attracted the attention of the people's government and received encouragement and assistance, finally realizing his long-cherished wish. Now, the agricultural experiment station is helping him continue to cultivate and improve the new cotton seeds. Another example is Fan Zhensheng, who created the improved harrow. More than ten years ago, he had the determination to improve the harrow for sowing, but in the environment at that time, his wishes could not be realized. It was not until after the land reform that his demand for this improved farm tool became more urgent. After the people's government learned about it, they invited him to the Xiongyue Agricultural Experiment Station, equipped him with ironworkers, carpenters, and technicians, and initially made an improved harrow according to his plan. After the trial and improvement by the state-owned Gongzhuling Agricultural Experiment Station, it finally became the most successful improved farm tool.

### 东北涌现大批劳动模范　创造发明改良农业技术

　　东北涌现大批劳动模范
    创造发明改良农业技术
    【新华社沈阳八日电】东北农村经过土地改革已涌现出大批的劳动模范。去年以来，受到黑龙江、辽东、吉林、热河、辽西等五省人民政府奖励的劳动模范即有二千三百三十七名。其中除了变工互助的模范外，最值得注意的是出现了大批改良农业技术的模范。
            改进耕作方法
    在改进耕作方法方面，辽东省宽甸县劳动模范王国满由于改良了土质和耕作方法，创造了较常年产量增加百分之四百的纪录。庄河县大阳沟村农民李建宣创造了“追肥间作”的种植方法，在一块地上同时种上三种庄稼，结果使收获量较一般产量增加三倍。松江省特等劳动模范金俊熙，在北纬四十四度零一分的宁安县试种棉花获得成功，每亩棉田收获籽棉一百八十二斤，较南满辽东、辽西地区每亩棉田的平均产量多出六十二斤，这个事实打破了过去伪满农业专家认为北纬四十三度四十分以北地区即不能种植棉花的“理论”，说明了东北棉花的种植可以逐渐北移。吉林省一等劳动模范赵享英试验成功的水稻温床育苗法，使稻子即使在气温很低的情况下，也可提前半月插秧，又可播种晚生种，而收获量较一般的撒播和插秧法的收获量提高达百分之七十四。
            改良农具
    东北各地农民在改良农具方面也有显著的成就。自土地改革以后，很多农民为着提高业已归于自己所有的土地的产量，自行苦心研究，反复实验，创造了许多有效的改良农具。黑龙江一省就出现了二十三种播种机、锄草机和改良的犁、?耙等农具。辽东省盖平县范振声创造改良?耙，使每种一垧地比旧式?耙节省三个劳动力。讷河县农民徐有财创造了播种机，用一人二马，每天能播种十五亩地，比旧木犁播种同样面积的土地要节省三个人工和一个马工。
            改良品种
    作物品种的改良方面，辽西省盘山县农民王正年采用棉花苗接洋麻苗、再以棉花与洋麻花授粉的办法，培育了一种新的棉花品种，这种新的棉种，较东北原有的最好品种“关农一号”更具抗旱抗涝的能力，并且在它生长期间用不着掏尖打杈，此种“关农一号”节省三分之一的人工，产量也较“关农一号”高出四分之一，每棵能结桃十个。辽东省安东、新金等县农民创造了玉米杂交办法，使玉米的质量大大提高，产量也提高了百分之二十至三十，并且增强了玉米抵抗病害的能力，黑穗病的比例已降低到百分之三。
            防除病虫害
    在防除病虫害方面，各地农民也发明了许多切实有效的办法。安东县农民潘国义去年发明用臭油杀泥包虫，结果使他的遭受虫害的稻子，每亩还能保持五百斤的产量。
    上述东北各地农民的各种改良农业技术的试验和创造，都是在人民政府的直接帮助下而获得成功的。创造新棉花品种的农民王正年，他在一九三三年就开始试验新棉种，但当他在一九四四年能以新棉种种植六亩地时，这种棉种即被日寇强迫夺去，使他长期苦心的研究受到沉重的打击。直到一九四九年（解放后第一年）春天，人民政府号召植棉，他才又找出了一点残存的棉籽，种了一小块地，但这立即引起了人民政府的重视，受到了人民政府的鼓励和帮助，终于使他多年的愿望获得实现，现在农事试验场正在帮助他继续培育并改进新棉种。又如创造改良耙的范振声，他在十多年前就有改良播种用的?耙的决心，但在当时的环境里他的愿望始终无法实现；直到土地改革以后，他的这种改良农具的要求更为迫切，人民政府知道后，就邀请他到熊岳农事试验场，给他配备了铁工、木工、技术员，按照他的计划，初步制成了改良?耙，后经国营公主岭农事试验场的试用和改进，终于成为最成功的一种改良农具。
