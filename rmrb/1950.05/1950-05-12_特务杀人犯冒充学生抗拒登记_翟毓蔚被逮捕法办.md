　　Special Agent Murderer Impersonating Student Resists Registration:
　　Zhai Yuwei Arrested and Brought to Justice

　　[Our Newspaper] To consolidate revolutionary order and safeguard school safety, the Beijing Public Security Bureau yesterday (the 11th) arrested and brought to justice Zhai Yuwei, a special agent murderer who had infiltrated Normal University, impersonated a student, and resisted registration.

　　The criminal Zhai has consistently hated the people's revolutionary cause. As early as the Anti-Japanese War period, he turned to the Kuomintang bandit gang and carried out his counter-revolutionary criminal activities. The criminal successively served as the third detachment leader of the puppet 69th Army, the brigade commander of the puppet Shandong Security Brigade concurrently the county magistrate of Zhangqiu County, the administrative inspector commissioner and security commander of the 12th district of puppet Shandong, and the fourth and twenty-first column commander of the puppet Shandong Advance Army. During his tenure in puppet positions, the criminal tried his best to collude with the Japanese invaders, reorganizing a regiment of his subordinates, Li Fachuan, into the puppet "Bandit Suppression and National Salvation Army." Under the instigation of the criminal, the three special agent battalions under the "army" carried three guillotines each time they set out, and many cadres and progressive masses in the liberated areas at that time were killed by them.

　　After the Japanese invaders surrendered, the criminal colluded with the Kuomintang bandit gang and fled to Jinan. In addition to serving as the garrison commander of the suburbs of Jinan City, he also instigated his special agent first battalion to sneak into our Zhangqiu Licheng area to carry out sabotage activities such as assassinating cadres, besieging agencies, and looting money. It has been verified that those assassinated by him include Wang Linde, general affairs section chief of the Zhangli County Industry and Commerce Bureau; Wang Mingzhai, tax collector; Wang Xingtang, cadre of the Xianggongzhuang exchange office; Wang Desheng, public security officer of Mingshui District; and Wei Lie, women's cadre of Diaojia Town, Zhangqiu. In addition, they gathered bandits to besiege the Zhangli Tax Office and the Xianggongzhuang exchange office of the county's Industry and Commerce Bureau, robbing guns and a large amount of property, accumulating countless crimes. When Jinan was liberated in 1948, the criminal sneaked into Beijing, infiltrated the fourth grade of the History Department of Normal University, impersonated a student, and conspired to carry out lurking sabotage activities.

　　During the recent registration of special agents and reactionary party members and groups in colleges and universities in Beijing, the criminal not only resisted registration, but also remained cunning and evasive when questioned by the Public Security Bureau of the Second Outer District, resolutely resisting. The People's Government has no choice but to resolutely suppress such special agents who have committed numerous evils and refuse to repent. The Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested the criminal and brought him to justice yesterday.

　　特务杀人犯冒充学生抗拒登记
　　翟毓蔚被逮捕法办
    【本报讯】京市公安局为巩固革命秩序，保卫学校安全，昨（十一）日将混入师范大学，冒充学生，抗拒登记的特务杀人犯翟毓蔚逮捕法办。
    翟犯一贯仇视人民革命事业，早于抗日期间，即投靠国民党匪帮，进行其反革命的罪恶活动。该犯先后充当伪六十九军第三支队长、伪山东保安旅旅长兼章邱县县长、伪山东第十二区行政督察专员兼保安司令及伪山东挺进军第四和第二十一纵队长等。该犯于充任伪职期间，极力勾结日寇，将其部下李法传的一个团，改编为伪“剿共救国军”。在该犯主使下连续进犯我鲁中南和渤海解放区。该“军”所属的三个特务大队每次出发时，均带铡刀三口，当时解放区的干部和进步群众遭其杀害者甚多。
    日寇投降后，该犯遂同国民党匪帮窜入济南，除充任伪济南城郊警备司令外，且仍主使其特务一大队潜入我章邱历城地区进行暗杀干部、包围机关、抢劫钱款等破坏活动。据查明已被其暗杀者有章历县工商局总务股长王林德、征收员王明斋、相公庄兑换处干部王兴堂、明水区公安员王德生、章邱刁家镇妇女干部伟烈等。此外并聚匪包围章历税务所和该县工商局驻相公庄兑换处，抢劫枪枝和大批财物，罪行累累。一九四八年济南解放时，该犯潜来京市，混入师范大学历史系四年级，冒充学生，阴谋进行潜伏破坏活动。
    此次京市公安局进行专科以上学校特务分子、反动党团登记时，该犯非但抗拒登记，且于外二区公安分局传讯时，仍狡猾蒙混，坚决对抗。人民政府对此类作恶多端拒不悔过自新的特务分子，只有坚决加以镇压。市公安局乃于昨日将该犯逮捕法办。
