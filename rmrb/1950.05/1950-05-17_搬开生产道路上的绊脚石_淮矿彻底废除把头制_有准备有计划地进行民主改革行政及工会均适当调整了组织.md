　　【Report from Wanbei】The work of the Huainan Coal Mining Company to abolish the feudal "Bato" (foreman/gang leader) system in its mines and reform the underground labor organization was basically completed by the end of April. The democratic reform movement on the surface is also proceeding smoothly.

　　In order to carry out the struggle to abolish the "Bato" system in a prepared and planned manner, the Huainan Coal Mine established two training classes on April 1st and 2nd to educate the trainees, draw a clear line of demarcation between classes, and clearly understand the essence of the "Labor Cooperation Teams" (劳合班) and "Bato" leaders, thereby raising class consciousness. At the same time, they widely exchanged opinions on how to handle the reorganized personnel, the new labor organization, the standards for electing team leaders, the ratio for assessing wages, and labor discipline. The worker students enthusiastically exposed all the unreasonable old systems of the mine in the past and put forward dozens of specific suggestions for improvement. These suggestions became the basis for reforming the old system of the Huainan Coal Mine. On April 7th, the mine held a meeting of all "Labor Cooperation Team" leaders in the mine, attended by more than 200 leaders from various mines. Liu Qingquan, deputy director of the mine reorganization committee, announced the abolition of the "Bato" system and the dissolution of the "Labor Cooperation Teams" at the meeting, calling on the leaders to bow their heads and confess their guilt to the workers. Except for those with heinous crimes who were punished according to law, the general "Bato" leaders could be reformed through labor. The Party and government leading cadres of the mine made self-criticisms at the meeting, reviewing the shortcomings of being divorced from the masses in the past.

　　After the trained employees returned to the mine, they formed working committees or work teams to widely and deeply publicize and mobilize the abolition of the "Bato" system to the workers, which was unanimously supported by all the employees of the mine. From April 15th, the reorganization work was launched in various mines. Those who were brought in by the "Bato" leaders through personal connections and did not engage in production, or bad elements who had sneaked into the mine, were dealt with according to their respective situations after being reported by the workers. However, the mine was responsible for placing the generally redundant personnel. In order to change the shortcomings of the "Labor Cooperation Team" organization being too large (up to 300 people), the work being complicated (each team had eight or nine types of work), and the work locations being scattered, the mine established a new labor organization, dividing the "Labor Cooperation Team," which was in the form of a large contracting system, into several production groups.

　　In order to ensure the successful completion of the thorough reform of the old system, the administrative organization of the mine was also adjusted as necessary, based on the principles of centralized management, unified leadership, clear division of labor, and responsibility at each level. A Rationalization Proposal Committee and a Mine Management Committee were established. Each mine established a Mine Management Committee. Under the leadership of the higher-level enterprise organs, the management committee decided on major production and management facilities.

　　The trade union organization has also undergone necessary changes. Trade union groups were established based on production groups, lane committees (i.e., branches) were established in lanes or work sections; and mine committees (i.e., branches) were established with the mine as a unit, in order to closely integrate with and promote production work.

　　More than 100 "Labor Cooperation Teams" in Huainan Coal Mine were completely destroyed. The workers have truly turned themselves over, and production enthusiasm is gradually rising. The tunneling rate of the No. 1 inclined shaft of the Cai Mine was previously a maximum of 2.5 meters per day, but now it has created a record of 3.1 meters. The tunneling rate of the rock cave in the No. 3 inclined shaft has also increased from the previous maximum of 3 meters to 3.3 meters. The mine is now focusing on improving coal mining methods, adjusting the unit price underground, clearing up assets, and preparing to implement the Labor Insurance Regulations.

　　搬开生产道路上的绊脚石
　　淮矿彻底废除把头制     
    有准备有计划地进行民主改革行政及工会均适当调整了组织
    【本报皖北讯】淮南煤矿公司所属矿井废除封建把头制度、改革井下劳动组织的工作，已于四月底基本完成。井上的民主改革运动，亦正顺利进行中。
    为了有准备有步骤地开展废除把头制度的斗争，淮矿在四月一、二两日，成立了两个训练班，教育受训的职工，划清阶级界线，明确认识对劳合班和头子的本质，提高了阶级觉悟。同时，广泛交换了关于如何处理整编人员，新的劳动组织，选举组长的标准，评定工资的比例，及关于劳动纪律的意见。工人学员热烈揭发了该矿过去一切不合理的旧制度，提出具体改进意见数十件。这些意见，成为改革淮矿旧制度的基础。四月七日，矿方召开全矿劳合班头子会议，到各矿头子二百余人，矿区整编委员会副主任刘庆泉在会上宣布废除把头制度，解散劳合班，号召各头子向工人低头认罪。除罪大恶极者依法惩办外，一般头子可在劳动中改造。该矿党、政领导干部分别在会上做了自我批评，检讨了过去脱离群众的缺点。
    受训职工回矿后，分别组成工作委员会或工作队，广泛深入地向工友进行关于废除把头制的宣传动员，获得全矿职工一致拥护。从四月十五日起，各矿场先后展开整编工作。凡由头子以私人关系拉进来的不事生产的分子，或钻到矿山来的坏分子，经工人检举后，分别情况处理。但一般编余人员，均由矿方负责安插。为了改变劳合班组织太大（多者达三百余人），工作复杂（每班有八九种性质的工作）和工作地点分散的缺点，该矿建立了新的劳动组织，把大包工形式的劳合班划成若干生产小组。
    为保证此次彻底改革旧制度的工作能胜利完成，根据集中管理、统一领导、明确分工、按级负责的原则，该矿行政机构也作了必要的调整。设立了合理化建议委员会，和矿山管理委员会。各矿场设矿场管理委员会。管委会在上级企业机关领导下，决定有关生产及管理的重大设施。
    工会组织也作了必要的改变。依据生产小组建立工会小组，在巷道或工作段中建立巷道委员会（即支会）；以矿井为单位，成立矿井委员会（即分会）。以便密切结合与推进生产工作。
    淮矿一百多个劳合班被彻底摧毁了。工人真正翻了身，生产情绪逐渐高涨。蔡矿一号斜井炭窑掘进率，过去每天最多二米五，现在创造了三米一的纪录。三号斜井石洞掘进率亦由过去最高的三米提高到三米三。该矿现正有重点的改进采煤方法，调整井下单价，清理资财，做好实施劳动保险条例的准备。
