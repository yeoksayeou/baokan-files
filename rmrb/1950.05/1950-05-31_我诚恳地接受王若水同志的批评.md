　　I sincerely accept Comrade Wang Ruoshui's criticism
    Zhang Zhongshi

    After reading Comrade Wang Ruoshui's criticism of my translation of Engels' "Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy," I am extremely grateful. As Comrade Wang said, the translation of Marxist-Leninist classics is a serious task, and one should bear the greatest responsibility to the original author and the readers. I admit that I have not been serious, careful, and responsible enough in this regard, and have made the mistake of acting rashly. Therefore, I sincerely accept Comrade Wang's criticism. In addition to carefully correcting the entire translation of this book again with other comrades recently, I am willing to work hard to correct my above-mentioned shortcomings in future work. In the translation of this book, there must be many errors, inaccuracies, and difficult-to-understand places other than those pointed out by Comrade Wang. I hope that other readers, especially comrades in many senior schools that use it as a study reference book and textbook, can offer as many opinions as possible for reference during proofreading.

    I agree with most of the points pointed out by Comrade Wang, and a few points still need to be considered. Now I will write my opinions below. To save space, I will speak in the order mentioned in Comrade Wang's two letters, and the page numbers and sentences of the original book will not be repeated.

    1. In the sentence "a person who is not developing normally," the word "not developing" should be translated as "slightly" or "a little".

    2. "Believes himself" should be "is believed".

    3. "Eighth century" is a mistake for "thirteenth century".

    4. Note on "Rhadamanthus": "...was punished by the judge to hell," should be "was appointed as the judge of hell"; "translator" should be "editor".

    5. "One generation of people" should be "just one generation".

    6. "People of a certain subsequent generation" is not translated correctly. According to the Russian text, it should be "people of each specific generation".

    7. "In the state, what confronts us is the power of the first ideological system that dominates people" should be "The state is the first ideological force that dominates people that appears before us."

    8. "Once it (referring to the state - translator) occurs, it gains a kind of independence in relation to society, and the more it becomes an organ of a certain class, the more directly it realizes the rule of this class, the more independent it becomes." According to the Russian text, the translation is correct. However, for the sake of concise wording, the sentence "gains a kind of independence in relation to society" can be translated as "gains independence from society"; "a certain class" should be "a specific class".

    9. "...the right to equal happiness", the original translation was "...the equal right to happiness", which is a typesetting error. The word "seeking" should be added before "happiness", becoming "...the equal right to seek happiness". The sentence "...does not give more than slavery or serfdom gives" should be translated as "not necessarily more than what slavery or serfdom gives," according to the Russian text. The sentence "if it really does" is not in the Russian text.

    10. In the sentence "has not been recognized by him as something real without going around in circles," "without going around in large circles" should be "directly".

    11. In the sentence "serve the truth and justice," the word "serve" is correct according to the Russian text; the whole sentence should be "the service of truth and justice." "Ideal impulse" should be "ideal motive"; "ideal wish" can be changed to "ideal intention."

    Translation is a difficult task. On the one hand, it requires the translator to have a high sense of responsibility for the work—as mentioned above, I am still far from enough in this regard; on the other hand, it also requires the translator to have a certain degree of cultivation in the knowledge of his own language, foreign languages, and the content of the book—I am also very poor in these aspects. Therefore, not only has "Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy" not been translated well, but there are also many errors, inaccuracies, and difficult-to-understand places in the translations of my other books. For the translations of those books, I also hope that comrades will help me a lot and offer more criticisms!

### 我诚恳地接受王若水同志的批评

　　我诚恳地接受王若水同志的批评
    张仲实
    读了王若水同志对我译的恩格斯著《费尔巴哈与德国古典哲学的终结》一书的批评，我是极为感激的。正如王同志所说，马列主义古典著作的翻译是一件严肃的工作，对原著者和读者都应该负最大的责任。我承认，我在这一方面的确做得不够认真、仔细、负责，犯了轻率从事的错误。因此，我诚恳地接受王同志的批评。除了在最近与其他同志合作把这本书全部译文再仔细校正一遍以外，并愿今后在工作中努力改正自己的上述毛病。此书译文中，错误、不确切、生硬难懂的地方，除了王同志所指出的以外，一定还很多，希望其他读者同志，特别是许多采为学习参考书和读本的高级学校里的同志们，能尽量提出意见，以便校阅时参考。
    王同志所指出的各点中，多数我同意，有几点还需要斟酌。现在把我的意见写在下面。为了节省篇幅起见，就按王同志两信所说的次序来讲，原书页数和文句不再重复了。
    一、“一个不大正常发展的人”一句中“不大”二字应译为“稍稍”或“稍微”。
    二、“自认为”应为“被认为”。
    三、“八世纪”为“十三世纪”之误。
    四、“拉达曼”注文“…被法官罚入地狱”，应为“被任命为地狱的法官”；“译者”应为“编辑者”。
    五、“有人的一代”，应为“不过一个世代”。
    六、“人们某一任何后代”译得不对，按俄文本，应为“每一特定世代的人们”。
    七、“在国家中，摆在我们面前的是支配人的头一个思想体系的力量”应为“国家是出现在我们面前的第一个支配人的思想力量”。
    八、“它（指国家——笔者）一经发生，就在对社会的关系上获得了一种独立性，而且它愈成为一个一定阶级的机关，它愈直接实现这一阶级的统治，则它愈加独立起来。”按俄文本说，译文无误。但为文字简明起见，“就在对社会的关系上获得了一种独立性”一句可译为“就获得了对社会的独立性”；“一定阶级”应为“特定阶级”。
    九、“…幸福平等的权利”，原译本为“…幸福的平等权利”，系排错。“幸福”上应加一“求”字，成为“…求幸福的平等权利”。“…并不比奴隶制度或农奴制度所给予的多些”一句，按俄文本，应译为“未必多于奴隶制度或农奴制度所给予的”。“假如的确多些的”一句，俄文本无。
    十、“并没有被他未绕圈子而承认为一种现实的东西”一句内“未绕大圈子而”应为“直截了当地”。
    十一、“为真理和正义服务”一句中“服务”二字，按俄文本说，不错；全句应为“为真理和正义的服务”。“理想的冲动”应为“理想的动机”；“理想的愿望”可改为“理想的意向”。
    翻译是一件困难的工作。这在一方面要求译者对工作有高度的责任感，——上面说过了，这一点我还很不够；另一方面，还要求译者对于本国语文、外国语文和书籍内容的知识都有一定的修养，——这些方面，我也都很差。因此，不但《费尔巴哈与德国古典哲学的终结》这书没有译好，我译的其他各书译文中，错误、不确切、生硬难懂的地方也很多。对于那些书的译文，也希望读者同志们多多帮助我，多多提出批评！
