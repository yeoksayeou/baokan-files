　　Labor Reform of Special Agents Photo Exhibition Concludes
    Visitors Reach 12,000
    [Our Newspaper] The "Labor Reform of Special Agents" photo exhibition held by the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau at the Waterside Pavilion in Zhongshan Park opened on the 12th of this month and lasted for seven days, concluding on the 18th. Over 12,000 people visited the exhibition.

    Visitors unanimously expressed their support for the people's government's measures to reform special agents through labor. A porter named Li Yong asked the staff about whether there was a special agent being reformed named "Big Black," recounting how he had been oppressed by "Big Black" in the past. He concluded by saying: "Only our Communist Party would stand up for us and put the special agents in custody, forcing them to reform through labor. This is the merit of our Communist Party!"

    In the comments book, Li Junlong and Liu Wanjun wrote: "Labor reform of special agents completely conforms to the interests of the people." Jin Yufei wrote: "The new society turns ghosts into humans—letting them learn and live anew from the beginning!" Someone named Ali Dan wrote in the comments book: "Here, human morality has been highly manifested. We do not massacre the criminals who are against the people, but implement education and reform." The visitors all welcomed this exhibition. They suggested: "These kinds of exhibitions should be held often, so that the people can better understand the policies of the People's Government." Zhang Xirong and others also suggested: "These photos should be taken to major cities for exhibition."

    The intention of the Public Security Bureau in holding this exhibition was only to report to the people that the policy of reforming reactionary elements through labor, as stipulated in the Common Program, has begun to be implemented. However, many viewers could not be satisfied with this. They have requested that they can further understand the ideological progress of these special agents. Many visitors suggested that after sufficient materials have been collected, the ideological progress of the special agents should also be exhibited. Labor reform of special agents is the will of the people. Under the close attention of the people, all reactionary elements have no chance of being spared unless they bow their heads to the people, confess their crimes, and start anew as human beings.

　　劳动改造特务照片展览结束
    参观者达一万二千人
    【本报讯】京市人民政府公安局在中山公园水榭举办的“劳动改造特务”图片展览会于本月十二日揭幕，历时七天，已于十八日结束。前往参观者共一万两千余人。
    参观者对人民政府劳动改造特务的措施，一致表示拥护。搬运工人李永向工作人员打听那些被改造的特务中，可有一个叫做“大老黑”的，他诉说他从前如何受过“大老黑”的压迫。最后他说：“只有咱共产党才会替咱伸冤，把特务们圈起来，强迫劳动改造。这是咱共产党的功德呵！”
    在意见簿上，李俊龙、刘万钧写道：“劳动改造特务，这是完全符合人民的利益的。”金於飞写道：“新社会把鬼变成人——让他们从头学起，从头活起！”一位署名阿里单的人在意见簿上写道：“在这里，人类的道德有了高度的表现。我们对反人民的罪人，不是屠杀干净，而是实施教育改造。”参观者们对这一次的展览，都表示欢迎。他们提出：“这种展览会应该常有，让人民更加懂得人民政府的政策。”张锡荣等并建议：“把这些照片拿到各大城市去展览。”
    这次举办展览会，公安局的意旨只是在于向人民报告共同纲领中所规定的劳动改造反动分子的政策已经开始执行了。但是许多观众都不能以此为满足。他们纷纷要求能更进一步了解这些特务们在思想上的进步情况。许多参观者建议：在材料充分汇集之后，应当将特务们的思想进步情况也作展览。劳动改造特务，是人民的意图。在人民的密切注意下，一切反动分子，不向人民低头悔罪，从新作人，决没有侥幸的可能。
