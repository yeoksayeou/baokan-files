Seventh District Elections for Street Resident Representatives

[Report from this newspaper] The election of street resident representatives for the Seventh District All-Circles Representative Conference began extensively in eighteen sections on the 22nd. The entire district was divided into 450 groups based on streets, with each group electing one street resident representative. As of the 24th, 253 street residents had been elected, marking a significant departure from elections of the past.

The Seventh District has over 25,000 households, with the laboring people constituting the majority. Before liberation, they suffered immense oppression and lacked any democratic rights. Today, under their own government, they have a voice, and they feel an indescribable excitement. An elderly gentleman in his sixties, participating in the election, said, "In the past, I had no place to voice my grievances. Now, the People's Government wants everyone to contribute ideas. I've lived for decades, and this is the first time I've seen anything like this."

Wu Yongmao, a shoemaker from the 16th section, said during the election, "During the Kuomintang's 'National Assembly' elections, candidates sold their houses to bribe voters. After they were elected, they made back much more money than they spent on buying votes. They turned elections into a business! Today's election is completely different from the past."

During each group's election, participating residents freely nominated candidates. The number of candidates was determined by everyone. The method of election was also freely chosen by everyone, such as raising hands, voting, or casting beans. After a barber from the 13th section was elected as a representative, he said, "This election is truly democratic. There are no large cars or banquets. It is truly elected by the common people." Hai Suzheng, a resident of the 17th section, said, "In the past, anyone who wanted to be elected had to host several tables of feasts to campaign. Now we can also be elected. There was no such thing in the past." The elected representatives are all loved by the masses. After Chang Xingquan, a resident of the 13th section, was elected, he was immediately hoisted up by everyone.

Preventing Bad Elements from Exploiting Loopholes

During an election in the 11th section, everyone initially nominated Wu Yutian as a candidate. A man named Zhang Caiyun then proposed Wang Linhai, who had previously served as a puppet Jia head. At this point, everyone refused to continue the election and dispersed in unison. Zhang Caiyun is a local hoodlum who served in the security forces under the Japanese invaders. In order to elect the puppet Jia head Wang Linhai, he brought in more than thirty people from outside the electoral district. The masses, upon seeing many people from outside the district mixing in, were worried that the puppet Jia head would be elected. They responded to the disruption of the saboteurs by refusing to vote, and planned to hold another election in the coming days.

Women Actively Participate in Elections

To date, many women have participated in and been elected in the elections. Among the 5,128 people who voted for street resident representatives, 2,398 were women. Women representatives account for twelve of the street resident representatives. A woman from the 16th section excitedly said during the election, "This time, women also have a share." However, many women are not very familiar with electing representatives, and some are still shy.

Submitting Their Opinions to the Representatives for Handling

After the representatives were elected, many residents enthusiastically submitted their opinions to the representatives. The Seventh District is the dirtiest area in the city and has the most rudimentary welfare facilities. Therefore, citizens raised the most opinions regarding tap water, stinky ditches, toilets, street lights, and the repair of dilapidated houses. Some people proposed that the police station should immediately mobilize residents to sign the peace declaration.

Everyone criticized the poor work style of some cadres on weekdays. Residents of the 13th section reported that the scales at the No. 9 retail store were short. The district government is currently investigating this matter in depth. At the newly built Flour Mill No. 1 in the Seventh District, the municipal government had approved a temple for them to use as a warehouse. The original nine households moved out, and several of those who moved out raised concerns, saying, "Before the relocation, the factory promised to pay relocation fees, but there has been no news since then." After investigation by the district government, it was confirmed to be true, and the factory has been instructed to issue a total of nine bags of flour to the nine households. Everyone is very satisfied that the government accepts the criticism and supervision of the people. Shop assistant Jing Ruimin said, "If the government does something wrong, everyone can speak up. How can the Communist Party's policies be bad? Who would dare to say anything under Kuomintang rule!"

During the three days of the election campaign, bad elements were discovered spreading rumors and sabotage, such as saying "Those elected as representatives will go to the front to fight, and those who sign the names will fight in the rear," and "After this representative meeting, ten families will share one door." Both of these rumors occurred in the Eighth Section. This is clearly a planned act of sabotage by special agents, which deserves our increased vigilance!

### 七区选举街道居民代表

　　七区选举街道居民代表
    【本报讯】七区各界代表会议街道居民代表的选举，从二十二日起在十八个段普遍展开。全区按街道划分了四百五十个组，每组选一个街道居民代表，至二十四日止，今昔选举大不相同，已选出街道居民二百五十三人。
    七区居民共二万五千多户。劳动人民最多。在解放前受尽了压迫，没有一点民主权利。今天，他们在自己的政权下，有了说话的地位，都感到说不出来的兴奋。一位参加选举的六十几岁的老先生说：“早先我有苦没处诉，现在人民政府要由大家出主意，我活了几十年了，还是第一次见。”
    十六段一个尚鞋工人吴永茂在选举时说：“国民党选‘国大’，竞选的人把房子卖了贿选。他们当选后，搂回的钱比卖房子的钱多的多。他们拿选举做起买卖来了！今天的选举，和过去完全不一样。”
    各组选举时，都由参加的居民自由提出候选人。数目由大家决定。选举的方式也由大家自由选择，如举手、投票、投豆。十三段某理发工人当选代表后说：“这次选举是真民主，也不用大汽车请客，真正是老百姓选出来的。”十七段居民海溯正说：“过去谁要想选上，谁就得开几桌席运动运动。现在咱们也能当选了，早先那有这样的事情。”选出的代表，都受到群众的爱戴。十三段的居民常兴泉当选后，当场就被大家高举了起来。
    不让坏人钻了空子
    十一段的一个组在选举的时候，大家最初提出吴玉田做候选人。一个叫张财云的人又提出一个曾作过伪甲长的王林海来，这时大家都拒绝再选，不约而同地相继走散。张财云是个地痞，在日寇手下当过治安军。他为了选上伪甲长王林海，从这个选区之外拉来了三十几个人。群众当场见到很多区外的人混进来，耽心选上伪甲长，就以拒绝选举的手段来答复了破坏分子的捣乱，准备于日内再行选举。
    妇女踊跃参加选举
    到目前为止，妇女参加选举和当选的都很多。投票选街道居民代表的五千一百二十八人中，就有妇女二千三百九十八人。街道居民代表中，妇女代表占十二名。十六段的一个妇女在选举时兴奋地说：“这回也有咱妇女的一份了。”但也有不少妇女对选代表不太了解，有的还害羞。
    提出自己意见交付代表处理
    代表选出后，许多居民向代表踊跃地提出了自己的意见。七区是全市最脏和福利设施最简陋的地方。因此市民们对自来水、臭水坑、厕所、路灯和修理要倒的房子等，提出意见最多。并有人提议派出所应立即发动居民在和平宣言上签名。
    大家对某些干部平日的不良作风提出了批评。十三段的居民检举第九零售店的秤小。区政府正深入了解中。在七区的新建面粉一厂，市府曾批给他们一所庙做仓库。原有的九家住户搬了家，几位搬出来的人提出意见说：“搬家以前，该厂答应给搬家费，可是一直没有信。”现经区政府调查属实，已转达该厂补发给九个住户共九袋面粉。大家对于政府接受人民的批评和监督感到很满意。店员景瑞民说：“政府有做错的事情，大伙可以说，共产党的政策怎么会不好？国民党统治时谁敢说！”
    在三天的选举运动中，曾发现坏分子造谣破坏，如说“选上代表到前方打仗，签名的在后方打仗”，“这次代表会后，十家走一个门”等。这两个谣言都发生在第八段。这显然是特务分子有计划的破坏行动，值得我们加强警惕！
