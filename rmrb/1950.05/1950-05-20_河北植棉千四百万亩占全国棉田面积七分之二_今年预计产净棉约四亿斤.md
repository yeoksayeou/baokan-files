　　Hebei Plants 14 Million Mu of Cotton, Accounting for Two-Sevenths of the National Cotton Field Area
　　This Year's Estimated Production of Ginned Cotton is Approximately 400 Million Jin
    [Baoding Dispatch] The broad masses of working people in Hebei Province have completed cotton planting after twenty days of intense effort. The province originally planned to plant 12 million mu of cotton. Starting in mid-April, a warm cotton planting upsurge was initiated. As of now, the province has planted 14,021,579 mu of cotton, accounting for two-sevenths of the national cotton planting area, exceeding the original plan by 2,021,579 mu. If calculated at 28 jin of ginned cotton per mu, the province can produce over 390 million jin of ginned cotton. Among the province's ten special districts, except for Tianjin and Tongxian special districts which have not yet completed their plans (both are short by 100,000 to 130,000 mu from the original plan), the other eight special districts have exceeded their plans. The most significant exceedance is in Handan Special District, which originally planned to plant 2.1 million mu, but has planted a total of 3.2 million mu, exceeding the plan by 1.1 million mu. Tangshan and Shijiazhuang special districts have both exceeded by over 200,000 mu, Hengshui has exceeded by 179,000 mu, and Xingtai, Dingxian, and Cangxian have all exceeded by 30,000 to 60,000 mu. The people's governments and the CPC committees at all levels in the province attach great importance to cotton planting work. During the spring plowing and sowing, cotton planting work was given top priority. Through people's representative conferences and cadre meetings at all levels, serious mobilization and arrangements were made. When leading the masses in setting up household plans, various localities mobilized the masses to carry out preparatory work such as reserving cotton fields, preparing cotton seeds, and harrowing cotton fields. Various economic departments lent out large quantities of cotton seeds and fertilizers to support the masses in planting cotton. The Shijiazhuang and Hengshui special districts alone lent out 14.3 million jin of cotton seeds and 48 million jin of fertilizer. In order to realize the plan of completely replacing with superior cotton seeds within five years, the province also designated superior cotton seed promotion areas, covering a total area of 800,000 mu.

　　河北植棉千四百万亩占全国棉田面积七分之二
　　今年预计产净棉约四亿斤
    【本报保定讯】河北省广大劳动人民，经过二十天的紧张突击，已完成棉花播种。该省原计划种棉一千二百万亩，从四月中旬开始，即掀起热烈的种棉热潮，截至目前为止，全省已种棉一千四百零二万一千五百七十九亩，占全国种棉数的七分之二，超过原计划二百零二万一千五百七十九亩。如以每亩产净棉二十八斤计，则全省可产净棉三万万九千多万斤。该省十个专区中，除天津、通县两个专区尚未完成计划外（距原计划都相差十万到十三万亩），其他八个专区均已超过计划。超过最多的是邯郸专区，该专区原计划播种二百一十万亩，共已播种三百二十万亩，超过计划一百一十万亩。唐山、石家庄两专区都超过二十万亩以上，衡水超过十七万九千亩，邢台、定县、沧县都超过三万到六万亩。该省各级人民政府和中共各级党委对种棉工作均极为重视。在春耕播种中，将种棉工作提到首要地位，通过各界人民代表会、干部会，作了认真的动员与布置。各地在领导群众订户的计划时，就发动群众进行了留棉田、准备棉籽、打耙棉田等准备工作。各经济部门为支持群众种棉，而贷放了大批棉籽、肥料。仅石家庄、衡水两专区，就贷下棉籽一千四百三十万斤，贷肥四千八百万斤。该省并为实现五年内全部换成优良棉种的计划，曾划定了优良棉种推广区，面积共达八十万亩。
