　　Key Inspection of State-Owned Enterprises in Northwest China
    Production Resumption and Management Improvement Achieved, but Blindness and Waste in Production Still Severe
    [Our Newspaper] Since March, the Northwest Financial and Economic Committee and the Ministry of Industry have conducted key inspections of certain state-owned enterprises to implement the policy of practicing strict economy and reducing costs, and to launch an anti-waste campaign. Based on materials from units such as the Xi'an People's Power Plant under the Northwest Power Construction Company, the No. 2 Textile Factory under the Northwest Textile Construction Company, and the Longxian and Tongchuan Coal Mines, these units have made considerable achievements in resuming production, partially reforming enterprise structures, and improving management and operation since liberation last year. Redundant personnel are being gradually reduced, waste has been somewhat decreased, and management systems are gradually being improved. Some factories have established factory management committees, absorbing workers to participate in enterprise management. Some factories have launched production competitions and cultivated a number of activists. Many examples of workers automatically improving production tools, increasing efficiency, and reducing costs have emerged. However, in general, blindness in production, poor management, and waste of raw materials and other aspects are still serious.
    The main cost of the Xi'an People's Power Plant is fuel coal. Due to the lack of regular maintenance of machines, too much dust and rust, many places where steam leaked and heat escaped, failure to pay attention to improving firing technology, and the lack of strict regulations for coal usage, a lot of fuel coal was wasted. Now, after testing, it has been confirmed that the coal consumption for generating one kilowatt-hour of electricity from No. 3 generator can be reduced by more than half a kilogram (originally two kilograms). If the No. 2 factory repairs all the problems that can be repaired on the boilers and generators, it is estimated that it is entirely possible to reduce coal consumption by half a kilogram per kilowatt-hour. With the entire factory generating 10 million kilowatt-hours this year, a total of 5 million kilograms of coal can be saved, equivalent to 1 billion yuan. According to the factory's inspection, from liberation in May last year to the end of February this year, the waste caused by unreasonable use of manpower and the lack of careful calculation in factory electricity consumption and engineering construction totaled more than 457 million yuan. The cotton yarn wastage of the No. 2 Textile Factory is also very large. The factory discards about 1,400 to 1,600 pounds of waste fine yarn ends every month, equivalent to four bales of yarn. Before March, a total of 15,000 pounds of waste roving was discarded, which could spin more than 30 bales of yarn. Although rework (re-spinning when the spinning is not good) has decreased compared to the Kuomintang rule, the quantity is still considerable.
    The lack of foresight in enterprise management, blindly expanding production, or blindly buying and accumulating raw materials, resulting in a large amount of capital tied up and causing losses, is also quite common. The Xi'an People's Power Plant accumulated 8,000 to 9,000 tons of inferior coal, enough for four or five months of use (normally only one month of coal is sufficient), tying up more than 2 billion yuan of capital. The Longxian and Tongchuan coal mines did not study the future of the mines (poor coal quality; once coal from the east arrives, they will have no market), blindly expanded, and 80,000 to 90,000 tons of coal piled up and could not be sold. As a result, Longxian was closed, and Tongchuan was on the verge of collapse. The Ningxia Match Factory also suffered from being too far from the raw material production area, poor management, and high costs, accumulating a large amount of finished products that could not be sold and unable to circulate capital. It will be difficult to improve in the future, because Shanghai matches are cheaper even when transported to Ningxia.
    Many enterprises retain the work style of military production and do not pay attention to costs and sales.
    Many leading cadres of enterprises still retain the work style of the past military production era (most of them come from military industry departments): they only care about completing production tasks, regardless of costs and sales, and do not pay attention to the market and prices. When the supply and marketing departments purchase materials, some are bought too expensively, and some cannot be used or do not meet standard specifications, so they have to be used at a lower grade (for example, turbine oil is purchased, but the grade is not sufficient, so it is used as lubricating oil). Four cases were recently inspected, with losses of 9.25 million yuan. Many of the cadres in the enterprises do not understand technology and are not determined to learn, so they have to rely on old employees to do things as before, and many things that should be developed and reformed are not taken care of. The forging workshop of the Xi'an People's Power Plant still uses human-powered bellows, which is labor-intensive and inefficient. It is only a few dozen yards from the coal yard to the power plant; if a few old rails were laid, a large amount of coal could be pushed into the plant, but it has always been contracted to dozens of workers who use small carts to push, costing 80,000 to 90,000 catties of white flour in labor costs per year. Many useful steel plates, iron pipes, and machine parts, as well as air compressors worth more than a thousand US dollars, are exposed to rain in the factory. They are covered in thick rust. The accounting department of the textile factory does not even have a reporting system, and does not know how much material is spent in a month. The engineering director does not know the monthly output.
    The above situation hinders the reduction of costs and the development of enterprises. However, many enterprise cadres still do not have sufficient awareness. They emphasize that the machines are not good, the raw materials are not good, and so on. The Shaanxi Highway Bureau has lost a lot of business to private transportation vehicles because of high transportation costs. But instead of trying to reduce transportation costs, they want to use administrative power to force all public institutions to transport their materials through them. The opinion itself can be considered, but if they do not improve management and reduce transportation prices, that is, if they want other institutions to suffer losses and take advantage of them, it will be difficult to implement. Chairman Peng Dehuai said that the main problem in today's factories and enterprises in Northwest China is management. This requires the leading cadres of enterprises to consciously change the ideological style left over from the military production era that is inconsistent with the enterprise-based operation and management.
    After thoroughly reviewing the above issues, the recently held Northwest Industrial Conference decided to start establishing strict cost accounting systems, machine responsibility systems, and work responsibility systems; implement democratic management, set quotas and standards, streamline institutions, and plan production. Whether these measures can promote rapid improvement in various units will depend on whether the ideological style of the leading cadres can be quickly transformed. (Lin Wei)

　　西北重点检查公营企业
    恢复生产改善管理已获成绩  生产中盲目性及浪费仍严重
    【本报讯】西北财委会与工业部为在工厂企业中贯彻厉行节约、减低成本的方针，三月份以来，对某些公营企业进行重点检查，开展反浪费运动。从西北电力建设公司所属西安人民电厂、西北纺织建设公司所属纺织二厂，及陇县、铜川煤矿等单位的材料看，自去年解放以来，这些单位在恢复生产，部分地改革企业机构及改善管理经营等方面，是有相当成绩的。冗员在逐步精简，浪费有若干减少，管理制度也在逐步改进。有的厂已成立工厂管理委员会，吸收工人参加企业管理。有的厂发动了生产竞赛，培养出若干积极分子。工人自动改良生产工具、提高效率与减低成本的事例，已经出现不少。但一般说来，生产中的盲目性、管理不善与原料材料及其他方面的浪费还是严重的。
    西安人民电厂的主要成本是燃煤。由于机器缺乏定期的检修，尘锈太多，漏汽走热之处不少，烧火技术未注意改进，用煤缺乏严格的制度，致燃煤浪费很多。现经试验证实，三号机发一度电的煤耗可减低半公斤以上（原为二公斤）。二厂如将锅炉与发电机上能修理的毛病一一修好，估计每度电减低煤耗半公斤完全可能。全厂今年以发电一千万度计，共可省煤五百万公斤，合十亿元。另据该厂检查，从去年五月解放到今年二月底，由于人力使用不合理，工厂自用电、工程修建等方面缺乏精打细算而造成的浪费，共计在四亿五千七百万元以上。纺织二厂的棉纱损耗都很大。该厂每月作废的细纱头在一千四百至一千六百磅左右。相当于四件纱。三月份以前作废的粗纱共一万五千磅，能纺纱三十多件。回花（纺不好时重新纺）虽比国民党统治时期减少，但数量仍相当不少。
    企业经营上缺乏远见，盲目扩展生产，或盲目买积原料，大量积压资金而造成的损失，也相当多。西安人民电厂买积劣煤八、九千吨，够四、五个月用（普通只有一月用煤即可），积压资金也在二十亿元以上。陇县、铜川两煤矿不研究矿的前途（煤质劣，东煤一来，自己便无销路），盲目扩展，八、九万吨煤堆着卖不出去，结果是陇县关闭，铜川濒于垮台。宁夏火柴厂也因距原料产地太远，经营不善，成本太高，积存了大量成品不能销售，无法周转。将来也很难好转。因为上海火柴运到宁夏还比他便宜。
    不少企业残留兵工生产作风，不注意成本和销路。
    有许多企业领导干部，至今残留着过去兵工生产时代的作风（他们大部来自兵工部门）：只管完成生产任务，不管成本和销路，不注意市场和物价。供销处采购物资时，有的买得太贵，有的买来不能用，或不合标准规格，只好降级使用（如买了透平油，度数不够，当滑机油用）。最近检查了四宗，损失为九百二十五万元。企业中的干部，有许多不懂技术，也不下决心学习，只好依靠旧职员照旧样子做，许多应兴应革的事没人管。西安人民电厂的锻工间，至今使用着人拉风箱，既费人工，又效率低。从煤栈到电厂只有几十码路，弄几根旧轨一铺，就能大量推煤入厂；但一直是包给几十个小工用小车推，一年须出工价八、九万斤白面。厂内雨地上淋着许多有用的钢板、铁管和机器零件，还有价值千元以上美金的空气压缩机。都生了很厚的锈。纺织工厂的会计课连表报制度都没有，不知道一月支出多少材料。工务主任不知道每月产量。
    上述情况，障碍着成本的降低与企业的发展。但有许多企业干部至今仍无足够的自觉。他们强调的是机器不好，原料不好等等。陕西公路局因为运费高，被私人的运输汽车夺去好多生意。但他们不是设法减低运费，却想以行政力量强制一切公家机关的资材都交给自己运。这意见的本身是可以考虑的；但自己如果不改善管理，减低运价，即是要别的机关吃亏，自己来占便宜。很难行得通。彭德怀主席说，西北今天的工厂企业中主要是管理问题。这就要求企业领导干部们自觉地改变兵工生产时代遗留下来的与企业化的经营管理相矛盾的思想作风。
    最近召开的西北工业会议，将上述问题彻底检讨之后，决定开始建立严格的成本核算制，机器专责制，工作专责制；实行民主管理，定员定额，精简机构，计划生产。这些措施在各单位能否促成迅速的改进，将视各领导干部的思想作风能否迅速转变而定。（林韦）
