　　Female Communist Party Member Zhang Mengxian Actively Engages in Labor
    Zhang Mengxian, a female Party member from Dongyan Village, Tang County, is twenty-four years old this year and comes from a middle peasant background. Her family consists of her sixty-year-old grandmother, mother, and eight-year-old younger brother, totaling four people, who cultivate thirteen mu of land. Since her father passed away in 1945, the family has lacked labor. At that time, Mengxian was nineteen years old and relied on the help of an uncle, making life very difficult. Because Mengxian was active in various tasks, she joined the Communist Party in 1946. The Party branch secretary constantly said that it was glorious for women to participate in production. She thought to herself that her family had the old and the young, and no one to cultivate the land. She was not very old, but it was difficult for her to work alone in the fields. So she constantly discussed with a young woman named Zhang Jincui how to allocate work. At first, she did the field work. If she didn’t know how to do something, she would learn from her uncle. After two years, in 1949, she could handle sowing, plowing, and weeding. Mengxian took charge of all the work in the fields, weeding the cotton and grain twice. She also led Jincui and Cuikun to weed eight mu of land a day with large hoes. At noon, Mengxian's grandmother would make white flour pancakes and wait for them to return for a meal, thinking, "These three girls haven't come back yet in such hot weather." Due to Mengxian's influence, she also motivated Zhang Yinhua, Zhang Suxiang, and the labor-deficient Zhang Chunyan and Zhang Aixian, all four of whom were young women. They often allocated work to the fields together. They also spun thread together at night, which saved oil and was lively. They would spin four liang of thread each night before going to sleep. In the winter of 1949, Mengxian used the money she earned to buy two sets of fine cloth clothes. The harvest from the fields was also considerable, with seven sacks of grain, two hundred jin of cotton, three sacks of black beans, and also yams and vegetables, etc. She planned to buy half a waterwheel in partnership with others this year, and also buy a donkey in partnership. Mengxian's grandmother said, "Since Mengxian took over the responsibilities, the family has been much better off than in the one or two years after her father died." This year, she applied thirty more large carts of manure to her land than last year, and watered the wheat earlier than most people, and responded to the government's call by planting half a mu of cotton. Mengxian is determined to work hard in production, so that this year's harvest will surpass last year's.

　　积极劳动的女共产党员张孟先
    唐县东沿村妇女党员张孟先，今年二十四岁，系中农成份。家中有六十岁的老祖母、母亲和八岁的弟弟共四口人，耕种十三亩地。自从她父亲在一九四五年去世以后，家中即缺乏劳动力。当时孟先十九岁，依靠一个叔叔帮忙，生活很困难。由于孟先对各种工作积极，一九四六年参加了共产党。党的支部书记不断讲，妇女参加生产是光荣的。她想，自己家里老的老，小的小，没人种地，自己年岁又不大，一人到地里作活很困难。于是她就和一位青年妇女张金翠不断在一块商量怎么拨工作活。开始她作地里的活，有的不会干，就跟她叔叔学。经过二年后，在一九四九年，种、耕、锄她都能干了。地里一切的活，由孟先担当，棉、谷都锄二遍。她还带动金翠和翠坤用大锄一天锄了八亩地。中午时孟先的奶奶作好白面饼，等她们回来用饭，心里想着：“这三个闺女这么热的天气还未回来。”由于孟先的影响，还带动了张银花、张素香，和没劳动力的张春彦、张爱先，四人都是青年妇女。她们经常拨工到地里作活，黑夜纺线也在一块，又省油，又热闹，每夜纺了四两线才睡觉。孟先在一九四九年冬天，用赚来的钱买了两身细布衣裳。地里打粮食也不少，收谷七口袋，棉花二百斤，黑豆三口袋，还有山药、菜等。她计划着除了吃的，今年和人家合伙买半挂水车，还和人家合伙买一头驴。孟先的奶奶说：“自从孟先顶了事，家里就比她爹死的那一、二年好多了。”今年她的地比去年还多上了三十大车粪，麦浇头回水比一般人浇的还早，并响应政府的号召，种了半亩棉花。孟先抱定决心努力生产，使今年收成超过去年。
