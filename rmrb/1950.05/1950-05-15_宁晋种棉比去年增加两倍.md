　　Ningjin Increases Cotton Planting by Threefold Compared to Last Year
    [This newspaper Ningjin dispatch] Ningjin County, Hebei Province, fully prepared for cotton planting during the spring plowing season. After rainfall in mid-April, the entire county launched a cotton planting campaign. By the end of April, 150,000 mu of cotton had been planted, a threefold increase compared to last year. After the second spring rain, the production enthusiasm of the county's farmers was particularly high. The county leadership immediately seized this favorable opportunity and mobilized cadres and teachers from all schools to go to the countryside to launch a concentrated cotton planting effort. Due to strong leadership, cadres and farmers throughout the county were quickly involved in the cotton planting campaign.

    During the cotton planting, a large number of cotton planting models emerged. Zhao Shunzi, the Communist Party branch secretary of Tuanjie Village in the First District, planted all ten mu of his land with cotton and challenged all village cadres to lead the masses and successfully complete the cotton planting task. Many village cadres used their own labor and livestock to help households without labor plant cotton, and extensively organized mutual aid to solve labor difficulties.

    Now, districts are proposing to not only complete the task but also exceed it. The Fifth District was assigned 3,000 mu and has now completed 6,500 mu. The Third District exceeded its original task by 1,300 mu. As of April 25th, county-wide statistics showed that over 150,000 mu of cotton had been planted, a threefold increase compared to the 50,000 mu planted last year. The cotton planting campaign is still in full swing, and the entire county is striving to exceed the goal of planting 200,000 mu of cotton.

　　宁晋种棉比去年增加两倍
    【本报宁晋讯】河北省宁晋在春耕阶段，即完全做好植棉准备，四月中旬下雨后，全县展开种棉运动，至四月底已完成种棉十五万亩，较去年增加两倍。二次春雨降落，全县农民生产情绪特别高涨。该县领导上马上抓住这一有利时机，动员全县干部各学校教员一齐下乡发动突击种棉。由于大力领导，使全县干部、农民迅速卷入了植棉运动。
    在种棉中，曾涌现出大批种棉模范。一区团结村中共支书赵顺子把自己十亩地全种上棉花，并向全村干部提出挑战，带领群众，胜利完成植棉任务。好多村干部用自己的人力畜力帮助无劳力的户种棉花，广泛的组织互助，解决了劳力困难。
    现在各区纷纷提出不但完成任务，还要超过任务。五区分配了三千亩，现已完成六千五百亩。三区超过原任务一千三百亩。四月二十五日全县统计已完成种棉十五万余亩，较去年五万亩增加了两倍。植棉运动仍在热火朝天的开展着，全县为超额完成种棉二十万亩的目标而努力。
