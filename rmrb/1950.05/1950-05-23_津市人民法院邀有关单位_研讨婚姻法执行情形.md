　　Tianjin Municipal People's Court Invites Relevant Units to Discuss the Implementation of the Marriage Law
　　[Tianjin News] According to the Tianjin Daily, the Tianjin Municipal People's Court convened a meeting on the 19th with the heads of the Civil Affairs Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Women's Federation, and mediation sections of various districts to discuss the implementation of the Marriage Law and collect feedback from all sectors. According to information learned at the meeting: since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, the number of marriage cases handled by the mediation sections in various districts has relatively increased. Since April 13th, Tangda District has accepted a total of 117 civil cases, of which 51 were marriage disputes, with 39 cases being filed by women. Most of these cases involved women opposing domestic abuse, bigamy by men, and discord between the two parties. This shows that the promulgation of the Marriage Law has had a significant impact on people's lives. After the promulgation of the Marriage Law, the Municipal Women's Federation and various districts held symposiums, mass meetings, and other means to explain the Marriage Law to the public, which played a considerable role. However, the publicity is not yet widespread and in-depth. Some people do not understand the Marriage Law, or even misinterpret it, believing that "raising women's rights has gone to extremes" and "divorce is too free." In addition, some men and women who have not reached the legal marriage age claim that they are completely voluntary and insist that the district office approve their marriage registration.
　　Wang Xiaoyi, the President of the Tianjin Municipal People's Court, repeatedly emphasized in his concluding remarks at the meeting that staff should vigorously publicize and study the Marriage Law carefully. In handling marriage disputes, it is necessary to be patient and meticulous, study and analyze the specific situation, be good at enlightening the masses, and correctly help the masses solve specific problems. Because marriage is an extremely complex social problem, it cannot be solved by simple judgments or orders; it is necessary to carry out long-term mass work in a thorough and patient manner in order to thoroughly implement the Marriage Law.

　　津市人民法院邀有关单位
    研讨婚姻法执行情形
    【天津讯】据天津日报消息：天津市人民法院于十九日邀集民政局、公安局、妇联及各区调解股负责人举行会议，研讨婚姻法执行情形并搜集各界反映。据会上了解：自婚姻法公布后，各区调解股的婚姻案件相对增加。塘大区自四月十三日以来共受理民事案件一百十七件，其中有五十一件为婚姻纠纷，其中经女方提出者有三十九件。这些案件中大多为女方反对家庭虐待，男方重婚及双方情感不和等。这说明婚姻法的公布已在群众生活中引起重大影响。在婚姻法公布后，市妇联和各区曾分别通过座谈会、群众会等方式，向市民讲解婚姻法，起了相当作用。但宣传还不够普遍和深入。部分群众对婚姻法还不了解，甚至曲解婚姻法，认为“提高女权走了极端”、“离婚太自由了”等。另外，还有些未到法定结婚年龄的男女，声称双方完全自愿，坚决要区公所准予登记结婚。
    津市人民法院王笑一院长在会议总结发言中，一再强调工作人员应大力宣传并好好学习婚姻法。在处理婚姻纠纷中，要耐心细致，研究分析具体情况，善于启发群众觉悟，正确地帮助群众解决具体问题。因为婚姻问题是一个极复杂的社会问题，不是简单的判决或命令就可解决的；必须深入耐心地进行长期的群众工作，才能彻底贯彻婚姻法。
