The long-standing phenomenon of smuggling and tax evasion remains serious;
　　Southwest salt affairs management urgently needs rectification

　　[Reported by our special correspondent Jiang Heng] Salt tax has been one of the most important sources of revenue in the Southwest over the years. This year, the Southwest salt tax also accounts for nearly a quarter of the total tax revenue in the region. However, in the first quarter, except for Chongqing, which exceeded the quota by more than 220,000 jin of rice, the six salt management bureaus in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou completed 54.3 percent of their targets under extremely difficult conditions, accounting for just over 17 percent of the annual salt tax task. In April, only 47.3 percent of the monthly quota was completed, far from the task requirements. While this was partly due to inconvenient transportation, underreporting, and funds being used as retained expenses and not remitted, the main reason for not completing the task was the long-standing poor management of salt fields. In addition, at the beginning of liberation, there was a general tendency among cadres to value public grain and undervalue tax revenue, leading to the relaxation of anti-smuggling work. As a result, the phenomenon of tax evasion and smuggling, where private salt accounts for about 40 percent of salt production, remains serious. In terms of salt field management, many salt farms, offices, and sub-bureaus have not rectified and transformed the old corrupt institutions (the South Sichuan Salt Management Bureau has made preliminary rectifications). It is extremely common for many employees and salt police in salt field management offices to smoke, gamble, be greedy, and release smugglers, or even collude with unscrupulous merchants and local bullies to smuggle salt. For example, in the Daning Salt Field in eastern Sichuan, almost everyone from the director to the salt police was involved in smuggling. The director alone smuggled 20 to 30 dan in March. In April, 20 staff members of the Zigong Salt Field were collectively found guilty of embezzlement after liberation. Salt police in various places are usually busy with their private affairs; when engaged in anti-smuggling, they often catch the small fry and let the big ones go. The imperfection of the salt affairs team has a great impact on the collection of taxes. In addition, the large-scale sale of private salt by stove households and merchants in various places has further fueled the rampant smuggling. For example, in Chongqing, 2,791 dan of private salt were seized in 81 cases, breaking Chongqing's anti-smuggling record over the years. According to statistics from northern Sichuan, eastern Sichuan, and Yunnan, the amount of smuggled salt in the first quarter reached 5,914 dan and 89 jin, of which 1,279 dan were seized. There are still 4,636 dan of private salt that evaded taxation. If each dan is taxed at 120,000 yuan, the tax revenue lost is 556.32 million yuan, accounting for 0.2 percent of the quota set for the first quarter. However, since April, the anti-smuggling work in northern and eastern Sichuan has made great progress after the unified financial and economic work in various places and overcoming the disregard for tax revenue work. The amount of smuggled salt has decreased from more than 100 dan per day to more than 10 dan. Secondly, the harassment by bandits and secret agents and the obstruction of transportation, which led to the stagnation of production and sales, also affected the completion of the salt tax task.
    The key to completing the salt tax task in the future lies in how to adjust the relationship between public and private transport merchants and strengthen anti-smuggling work. The Southwest Salt Affairs Bureau is now working to establish salt sales agencies in various counties to bring salt to the countryside, and is calling on private merchants to subscribe to and transport salt in order to jointly complete the transport and sales tasks.

### 历来走私漏税现象仍严重存在　西南盐务管理亟待整顿

　　历来走私漏税现象仍严重存在
　　西南盐务管理亟待整顿
    【本报讯】特派记者江横报道：盐税为西南历年来最重要收入之一，今年西南盐税亦几占全区税收的四分之一。但第一季度征收额除重庆超额二十二万多斤米外，川、云、贵等六个盐管局则在极困难条件下完成百分之五四·三，计占全年盐税任务百分之十七强。四月份亦仅完成该月核定额的百分之四七·三，距任务要求甚远。其中虽有因交通不便，缺报和作为坐支经费尚未抵解者外，而没有完成任务的主要原因，是由于历来盐场管理不善，以及解放初期干部中普遍存在着重视公粮，轻视税收思想，致放松缉私工作，而使历年来私盐占盐产十分之四左右的漏税走私现象仍严重存在。在盐场管理方面，由于不少场、署、分局对旧的腐败的机构未加以整顿改造（川南盐管局曾初步进行整顿），很多盐场管理所的员工与盐警，抽、嫖、贪、放私，甚至勾结奸商、地痞流氓走私是极为普遍的现象。如川东大宁盐场，从所长到盐警几乎人人走私，仅所长在三月份即走私二、三十担。四月间自贡盐场曾有二十个工作人员在解放后集体贪污。而各地盐警在平时多忙于家私；缉私时则常常捉住小的，放了大的，盐务队伍的不健全，对征收的影响很大。加以各地灶户场商大量倾销私盐，更助长了走私之猖獗。如重庆在八十一次破案中，就查着私盐二千七百九十一担，打破了重庆历年缉私的纪录。又据川北、川东、云南三地统计，第一季度走私盐斤达五九一四担零八九斤，查获一二七九担，漏税私盐仍有四六三六担之多，如以每担征税十二万元计，则少收税五亿五千六百三十二万元，占第一季度核定数的百分之○·二。但从四月份以来，川北、川东的缉私工作，在各地统一财经工作，克服轻视税收工作后，已大有进步，走私盐由每日百余担减少到十余担。其次由于土匪特务扰乱，交通受阻，产销停滞，致亦影响了盐税任务的完成。
    今后完成盐税的关键问题，在于如何调整公私运商关系和加强缉私工作。现西南盐务局正着手建立各县销盐机构，使盐下乡，并号召私商认额购运，共同完成运销任务。
