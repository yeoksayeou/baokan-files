　　Fengtai Electrical Depot of Tianjin Railway Bureau
    Completes Warehouse Inventory Ahead of Schedule
    Over a Thousand Kinds of Scattered and Disordered Materials Re-warehoused
    [This dispatch from Fengtai] The Fengtai Electrical Depot of the Tianjin Railway Bureau completed its warehouse material inventory ahead of schedule. The electrical depot is a repair department, managing 125 kilometers of track, 13 work areas, and 2 exchanges, with 1035 types of materials in stock, 16 warehouses of various sizes, 918 types of commonly used materials, 110 types of old materials, and 7 types of obsolete and waste materials. In April, the higher authorities instructed that the inventory of these materials must be completed by May 15th. On April 21st, the Beijing Branch of the Tianjin Railway Bureau convened a meeting of the heads of its affiliated factories and depots to make arrangements. The depot then established an inventory team, headed by the depot chief, responsible for research, publicity, and organization. On the 22nd, the Party branch also held a meeting of Party members to convey and mobilize, and the inventory team's suggestion to complete the work ahead of schedule by May 10th was put forward for discussion and fully approved after discussion. After the inventory work began, on April 30th, the material section reported: "The inventory of large and small materials in the warehouse is no problem thanks to the efforts of all staff, but the ten rolls of lead-sheathed cable and the 8-meter, 9-meter, and 10-meter poles are too heavy to move." On May 2nd, the inventory team called on everyone to participate in this work, and more than 30 workers signed up to participate. Under the leadership of Party members and activists, in one and a half days of work, a total of 29 bundles of cable of various sizes (total length of 2,3075 meters, total weight of more than ten tons) and 199 poles (average weight of more than 440 kilograms per pole) were all inventoried. The entire inventory work was also successfully completed on May 9th. Over a thousand kinds of materials, which had been scattered and disordered in the warehouse, were sorted, classified according to their properties, availability, and quantity, re-warehoused, and registered. This will greatly help in the future management, allocation, and control of materials.
