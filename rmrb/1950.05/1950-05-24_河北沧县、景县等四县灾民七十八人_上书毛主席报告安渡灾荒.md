Seventy-eight Disaster Victims from Four Counties, Including Cang County and Jing County, Hebei Province,
Write to Chairman Mao Reporting Safe Passage Through the Famine

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Seventy-eight disaster victims from Cang County, Jing County, Nanpi County, and Jiaohe County in Hebei Province wrote to Chairman Mao, reporting their successful passage through the spring famine. The full text is as follows: To Chairman Mao of the Central People's Government, forwarded by Chairman Yang of Hebei Province:

We are the common people from Cang County, Jing County, Nanpi County, and Jiaohe County. Because of the floods last year, the harvest was poor, and we became "disaster victims." We moved to Motou in Shen County, and with the enthusiastic help of the local government and people, we overcame the natural disaster and difficulties. Each of us has recovered from being thin and emaciated, and we have even saved three to five dou of grain. We are preparing to return home in three to five days to hoe the fields, cut wheat, and participate in production. During the famine relief, we deeply experienced that the people under your leadership are kind everywhere, displaying the spirit of "farmers all over the world are one family." In particular, we will never forget the care and concern of Guo Wenquan, the district head of Motou District People's Government in Shen County. Because of this, we also intended to present District Head Guo with a plaque and banner, but District Head Guo and other cadres politely declined. Therefore, we are willing to entrust Chairman Yang to tell you about this matter. Please rest assured that under your wise leadership, we have enough confidence to successfully overcome the famine and defeat difficulties. We also hope that this letter will be published in the newspaper to express our feelings. This is a common hope and request of seventy-eight disaster victims, men and women, from twenty-five households in six villages in our four counties.

Li Yugui and other disaster victims from Cang County came out of their homes in early October last year and arrived in Motou, Shen County, on the 17th. As soon as they met, District Head Guo insisted on having them eat. He immediately sent Secretary Ma and village cadres to make contact. Village Chief Zhu Erxiang found houses, pots, kang mats, hay, and wheat straw to prepare the kangs. District Head Guo also personally contacted the cotton warehouse and arranged for them to pick cotton. By the 20th, twenty male and female disaster victims were at work. Each person earned four catties of rice a day, which sustained them for more than a month. Later, District Head Guo saw that it was not enough for their living, so he discussed with the freight forwarding station, the district supply and marketing cooperative, and the Xinchang store in Motou Station on how to ensure they had work to do and food to eat. Therefore, on November 13th, they organized a transportation team, led by Guo Jinbang (a member of the Communist Party), a worker at the station's freight forwarding station. They and the local villagers transported wheat and millet to the granary and the Xinchang store, earning porterage fees, and did other work such as carrying coal and ash at the station to earn some millet, which sustained them for four months. Zhang Linzi, a disaster victim from Jing County, said, "Brother Guo Jinbang treated us too well. When the transportation team was first organized, he asked us to exert less effort and distributed the same amount of money. Two local freight forwarding workers, Ma Darong and Guo Fushou, said to us: 'You are too weak from hunger. Just do some light work. We will do more for you. Difficulties are only temporary. Who can be like this all the time! We are all under the leadership of Chairman Mao. We are one family!'" Li Yugui said, "When loading wheat into 250-斤麻袋 (jin mádài) sacks, they only asked us to put grain into the sacks and not to carry them. They said they were afraid of crushing us because our stomachs were empty. The workers' friendship with us is endless! After a month or so, we no longer felt flustered or dizzy, and we had strength, so we began to work normally." Yue Tianchen from Cang County said, "Last year, the workers at the station's freight forwarding station saved one hundred catties of rice. When we went home this time, they voluntarily gave it to us for travel expenses. Disaster victim Yue Guoshu had sores on his waist and did not go to work at the freight forwarding station for more than a month. Not only did he receive wages as usual, but he was also given twenty catties of rice as a subsidy for medical expenses. District Head Guo also gave him a note to go to the Dazhong Hospital for medicine (the expenses were paid by the district office after seeing the doctor). He went four times, and now he is healed."

Disaster victim Zhang Shutong said, "Since arriving here, not only have we had food and shelter, but I have also saved more than one shi of rice." Li Yuming has saved sixty-two catties of rice from February 23rd to the present by saving and economizing. Each of us can save an average of two catties of rice per day. Zhang Linzi's family has seven people. His old mother looks after the house, and six people came out. In addition to eating all the 360 catties of sorghum and corn, they also sent forty to fifty catties of dry food home. The sixty-six-year-old mother ate the dry food and gratefully said, "It is really good under the leadership of Chairman Mao. If it were that time (referring to the rule of the Kuomintang), we would either die or be skinned alive!" In order to respond to Chairman Mao's call and actively engage in production at home, Zhang Linzi's mother asked me to write you a letter to report this situation. Now the spring seedlings in our home are about to be hoed, and in another twenty days or so, the wheat will be ripe, and this famine will be successfully overcome.

The things that happened during the famine relief, we can't finish talking about them, and we can't finish writing about them. From this famine relief, we have experienced that with you, we have the confidence, the methods, and the hope to overcome the famine! We tell you that after returning home, we will continue to save for famine prevention and actively engage in production, planting crops well, and producing more grain until the autumn harvest and winter storage! Finally, we shout long live to you here, and we wish you good health! With our heartfelt greetings,

Representatives: Zhang Zilin from Jing County, Yue Tianchen from Cang County, Xu Zhengming from Jiaohe County, Feng Guoxi from Nanpi County, representing seventy-eight disaster victims from four counties
Respectfully submitted (May 13th)

　　河北沧县、景县等四县灾民七十八人
    上书毛主席报告安渡灾荒
    【本报讯】河北省沧县、景县、南皮、交河四县灾民七十八人，上书毛主席，报告胜利渡过春荒。全文如下：河北省杨主席转呈中央人民政府毛主席：
    俺们是沧县、景县、南皮、交河四县的老百姓，因为去年被水淹，收成不好，成了“灾民”。搬到了深县磨头，在当地政府和人民的热情帮助下，战胜了天灾，克服了困难。每人由饥黄面瘦的身躯，恢复了原状，积余下了三、五斗粮食。俺们正准备于三五日内回家锄地、割麦参加生产呢？在渡荒中，俺们深深体验到在您领导下的人民，到处是亲切的，发挥了“天下农民是一家”的精神。尤其是深县磨头区人民政府郭文泉区长对俺们的关怀和慰问，是永远不能忘怀的。为这事，俺们也曾打算给郭区长挂匾送旗帜，都被郭区长和其他干部婉言谢绝了。因此，俺们愿意将这个事情托杨主席转告给您。请您放心吧，在您的英明领导下，俺们已有足够的信心胜利渡过灾荒，战胜困难。并望将此信在报纸上公开发表，表表俺们的心肠，这是俺们四县六个村二十五户男女七十八个灾民共同的一个希望和要求。
    沧县灾民李玉贵他们去年十月初从家中出来，十七日到的深县磨头。一见面，郭区长就非扯着让他们吃饭，立刻又派马秘书和村干部接了头，村长朱二湘给找的房子、锅、炕席、干草、麦秸铺的炕都准备好了。郭区长又亲自和棉花栈接洽，让他们去拣棉花，到二十日，二十个男女灾民便上了工。每天每人挣四斤米，维持了一个多月的生活。后来郭区长看着他们不够生活，就又和磨头车站上脚行、区供销社、信昌商店商量，怎么着叫他们有活作，有饭吃，因此到十一月十三日便组织了个搬运脚行，由车站脚行工人郭金榜（系中共党员）负责领导。他们和本地的老乡给粮库、信昌商店运小麦、谷子，得脚力钱，并在车站上作抬煤弄灰等其他活挣些小米，维持了四个月的生活。景县灾民张林子说：“郭金榜老大哥待俺们可太好了，刚组织脚行时叫俺们少出力气，分一样多的钱。本地脚行工人马大荣、郭夫寿二人对俺说：‘您们肚子无食太虚弱，作点轻活就行啦，俺们多做点就有您的了。困难只一遭，谁还能经常这样呢！咱们都是毛主席领导的，咱们是一家子呢！’”李玉贵说：“装麦子入二百五十斤的麻袋时，他们光叫俺往袋装粮食，不叫俺扛。他们说，俺肚内空虚，怕压坏俺们，工人们和俺们的友爱真是说也说不完！这样过了个把月，俺们再不觉心慌眼发黑了，也有了劲了，才开始正常工作。”沧县岳天臣说：“去年车站脚行工人们存下了一百斤米，俺们这次回家，他们自动送给我们做路费用。灾民岳国树腰上长了疮，一个多月没有到脚行去工作，不但照样给工钱，还救济了他二十斤米当养病费。郭区长还给开了条子到大众医院去上药（看后由区公所负责开支），看了四次，现在已经好了。”
    灾民张树桐说：“自到了这里以后，不光有了吃的住的，俺还存了了一石多米。”李玉明自二月二十三日到现在，省吃俭用，积余下了六十二斤米。俺们每个人平均每天都能富余二斤米。张林子家有七口人，老娘看家，出来了六口人，除吃净剩三百六十斤高粱和玉米，还送到家里四五十斤干粮。六十六岁的老娘吃着干粮感激的说：“真是毛主席领导的好，要是那时（指国民党统治时）咱们死不了也得脱一层皮！”为了响应毛主席的号召，回家积极生产，张林子娘叫俺给您老人家写封信，报告这个情况。现在俺们家里的春苗也快开锄了，再有二十多天麦子就熟了，这个灾荒就胜利的渡过了。
    渡荒中的事，俺说也说不完，写也写不尽。从这次渡荒中，俺们体验到有了您，俺们渡荒就有信心，有办法，有希望！俺告诉您，回到家后，俺们一定继续节约备荒，积极生产，将庄稼种得好好的，多打粮食，直到秋收冬藏！最后俺们在这里高呼您万岁，谨祝您身体健康！谨致亲切的慰问礼
