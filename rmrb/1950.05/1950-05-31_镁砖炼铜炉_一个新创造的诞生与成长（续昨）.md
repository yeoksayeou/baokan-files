    IV. Technicians and Old Workers
    In July of last year, when Chen Lian'gao became the head of the copper smelting team, all the Bessemer furnaces were under his control, and his enthusiasm for innovation became even more unstoppable. Coincidentally, a new technician came to the smelting department, and Chen discussed his ideas with him.

    Originally, workers in smelting plants always looked at technical personnel with disapproval. In the Bessemer furnace department, the heart of copper production, people from the technical department had only visited three times in July, for a total of less than fifteen minutes. So, there was a song in the factory: "The factory's technicians do nothing; they spend all day flipping through books, bellies full." The technician, Zhao Qiming, was different. He had studied mining and metallurgy and had just graduated from university. Everything in the factory seemed new to him, and he often went to the shop floor to ask questions, quickly getting to know Chen Lian'gao. After hearing the idea of building a furnace with magnesium bricks, he became very interested and immediately looked up many Japanese books. However, the books clearly stated that no one had ever used magnesium bricks to make a furnace since the invention of the Bessemer furnace. He became skeptical. When Chen Lian'gao told him about the four experiments he had conducted, he felt that it was very scientific and finally agreed to jointly request an experiment.

    At this time, the factory director's management methods had already been severely criticized by the Ministry of Industry. After receiving the request from Chen and Zhao, he consulted the engineer for his opinion. The engineer said that there were many difficulties that could not be solved, the two major ones being: magnesium bricks transfer heat too quickly, and the furnace cannot maintain a certain temperature, so copper cannot be smelted; after the furnace is converted to magnesium bricks, it cannot "naturally form slag", and gold and silver ore used for slag formation must be thrown in from the furnace mouth. However, not only is it difficult to determine how much to throw in each time, but the most serious problem is that the furnace is too hot and the ore is too cold. Once thrown in, the molten copper will solidify a hard shell on the ore, making it difficult to melt. If the ore is damp, it can also cause an explosion. This will prevent slag from being formed.

    Chen Lian'gao was not convinced and said to Zhao Qiming: "I don't believe that a thin mud furnace can insulate heat, but a thick magnesium brick furnace cannot!" Zhao said: "It's not about thickness; magnesium bricks just transfer heat faster than mud." Chen said: "So that's the nature of magnesium bricks. I've learned something today. But can't we put a layer of insulating material on the outside of the magnesium bricks!" One sentence reminded Zhao Qiming: "Right, we can put a layer of coke powder or yellow mud on it, that stuff is insulating!" Chen also said: "I think slag formation is even less of a problem: if the ore is cold, we can't throw it into the furnace; we can pile the ore at the furnace mouth to heat it up, that should work! People can't stand the heat when standing far away to bake it. It's even easier to determine how much to throw in each time; we burn the furnace every day, and if we're not sure after one or two burns, we'll be sure after a few!" Zhao said: "Don't worry about that. I can calculate how much ore should be matched with how much iron." In this way, one contributed experience, and the other contributed theory, and all the engineer's doubts were resolved.

    However, the factory director's thinking could not be changed, and although the experiment was approved, the magnesium bricks were not issued for a long time. It was not until the Ministry of Industry reorganized the leadership of the factory in October that Chen Lian'gao's wish was realized. They were given magnesium bricks and time for the experiment, and workers were assigned to help them grind the bricks and build the furnace, which made Chen Lian'gao and Zhao Qiming happy to work hard for more than a month.

    At this time, the factory put forward the management policy of "going deep into the shop floor and solving problems", calling on technical personnel to combine with workers as a concrete step to improve production technology. But at that time, everyone did not quite believe in this policy. Until the magnesium brick furnace was almost built, there were still technical personnel who said to them: "It's terrible! Zhao Qiming wants to make a great invention!" Even the workers said: "If this works, what do we need engineers for?" However, on November 13th, the furnace was put into operation, and not only was the actual recovery rate one-third higher than that of the mud furnace, but the quality of the copper was also significantly improved. The first furnace surpassed the Japanese "1,500 years of crystallization of hard work."

    V. New Creations Bring New Problems
    "Workers have experience, and technical personnel have theory. This combination is really amazing." The magnesium brick furnace became a widely praised story. "Going deep into the shop floor" also began to become a new trend in the smelting plant. In the past six months, twenty-two of the factory's thirty technical personnel have jointly created new records with the workers. The creation of the magnesium brick furnace is indeed a good start.

    But the road to creation is not smooth. A series of new problems followed.

    First of all, how long can a magnesium brick furnace last? If it can't be used for a long time, won't the cost be higher than that of a mud furnace? Everyone had no experience, so they did not dare to convert other mud furnaces. Just at this time, the Northeast Industrial Department sent a Soviet technical expert. He repeatedly praised this new creation when he saw it and affirmed that it could be used for at least half a year. Then, he pointed out that the volume of the new furnace could be expanded and helped the workers redesign a larger furnace prototype.

    When repairing the new furnace, he saw the workers laboriously cutting and grinding dozens of different shapes of round bricks, so he suggested changing the round furnace to a square furnace. Some workers suspected: the pressure in the square furnace is not uniform, wouldn't it be dangerous? However, the Soviet expert said it with great certainty. Does the Soviet Union have this kind of square furnace?

    The Soviet expert said: not to mention the Soviet Union, all industrial countries in the world, except Japan, do not use backward mud furnaces. Although he is a smelting expert, it was the first time he had seen a Bessemer furnace. However, his task in the smelting plant was not to build a new factory like the Soviet factories he was familiar with, but to help everyone find a way to transform this factory for the better. After his repeated explanations, the factory and the workers adopted his suggestion and converted all the mud furnaces into square magnesium brick furnaces. As expected, the output per furnace increased by another 80%, and the labor for building the furnace was also reduced by two-thirds.

    In February of this year, copper ore gave the new furnace another problem: a large area of copper ore with a high lead content was left in the mine, which the Japanese had been unable to smelt and had accumulated for thirteen years. The technical regulations during the puppet Manchukuo period stated that it was not refined if it contained more than 6% lead. Last winter, when the factory refined copper ore containing 8% lead, the engineer stuck out his tongue. Now, to refine the factory's "difficult ore" containing 10% lead, it would require the high wind power of a new Soviet-style converter, otherwise the lead could not be completely blown away. However, the current blower was still the one used for the early mud furnaces, and the magnesium brick furnace was not a large converter wrapped in steel. How could it withstand such a large wind power? When the Soviet expert said, "The wind pressure can be increased by one time," many technicians and workers were frightened.

    However, the Soviet expert said: In the past, the Japanese technical regulations in the Northeast were only for the convenience of looting. The Bessemer furnace only refining rich ore and not refining poor ore and "difficult ore" was the easiest way to plunder. We cannot waste ore and cannot follow the old Japanese rules. After calculating the capacity of the blower and the pressure resistance of the magnesium brick furnace, he went to the furnace beside the more than 1,000-degree high temperature and personally started the wind. For a time, the wind and fire roared in the furnace, and everyone around him was sweating profusely, but he remained calm. After the operation was successful, he stayed by the furnace until everyone was completely convinced that it was safe to start the wind before he left.

    With the help of the Soviet expert's working methods, all the "poor ore" and "difficult ore" accumulated in the factory for thirteen years were smelted. When there was no ore to refine, even chimney ash, lead matte, slag, mine site surface soil, and even garbage dumps that had not been touched since the construction of the factory, all with very little copper and high lead content, entered the melting furnace, making the production volume in March reach 336% of the plan.

    VI. "Accidents are all man-made, and difficulties can all be overcome."
    In early April, the most serious test came: the newly arrived ore contained more than twice as much iron as before. As a result, the iron stuck to the furnace wall and could not come down, sticking thicker and thicker, no matter how hard you hit it with a sledgehammer or iron weld. This problem had never happened with mud furnaces. By early May, three furnaces had been stuck with iron, leaving only a quarter of their volume.

    Originally, iron had to combine with gold and silver ore to form slag, and it had to be blown into "iron oxide" first. However, the wind pressure had already been increased by one time, and there was more oxygen blown into the furnace. Before the "iron oxide" had time to turn into slag, it was blown into a very hard "ferric oxide". This iron had to be melted at a high temperature of 1,200 degrees, but the highest furnace temperature was only 1,100 degrees, so the iron stuck to the furnace wall and solidified into hard blocks. The difficulty was raised here: if the wind is not strong, difficult ore cannot be refined, and production cannot be increased; if the wind is too strong, iron will stick to the wall, preventing the magnesium brick furnace from surviving. Iron became the deadly enemy of this new creation.

    At this time, the Soviet expert said: "Accidents are all man-made, and difficulties can all be overcome; the furnace and the ore themselves are not at fault, the fault lies in the fact that we have not come up with a way to make them work well for people." When starting to refine this ore, the Soviet expert suggested: This time there is a lot of iron, so more gold and silver ore should be added. However, if too much is added, the slag will be thin, and it will not be easy to scoop out the slag, so the workers do not feed the materials according to the regulations. When the furnace was about to be stuck to death, they became anxious and looked for the Soviet expert to find a solution.

    The Soviet expert said: To prevent iron from sticking to the furnace, two methods must be used: add more gold and silver ore and increase the furnace temperature. After he went to the shop floor to study the results, he found that the operating methods were still based on the habits of the mud furnace, and the shutdown time was too long, so the furnace temperature loss was very large. For example, the wind must be stopped to scoop out the slag and replace the tuyere before you can start. However, if these two tasks are performed at the same time, 20 minutes can be saved each time. For example, adding copper juice to the furnace can also be done without stopping the wind. According to his calculation, the wind blowing time can be increased by a quarter, and the mud furnace can often be kept above 1,200 degrees.

    He had already come up with a solution for removing the iron from the furnace wall: put pig iron on the bottom of the furnace, and then increase the high heat and strong wind to allow the pig iron to burn (oxidize) and emit a large amount of high heat, which can melt the iron that sticks to the wall. However, the workers did not believe it: "How can iron burn? Won't adding more iron stick to the wall even more?" If the workers don't believe it, things will not be done well. So Zhao Qiming did two experiments: throwing iron sheets into the copper juice, and the iron sheets immediately emitted white light; inserting an iron brazier into the copper juice, and the brazier tip still burst into sparks when it was pulled out. When the workers believed it in their hearts, they started to work. Chen Lian'gao was even more active, working for 35 hours at a stretch. The furnace bricks that had not been seen for more than a month were indeed exposed.

    After breaking through a series of difficulties, the wind pressure of the magnesium brick furnace has been increased from 30 to 70, the furnace temperature is often maintained above 1,200 degrees, and the wind blowing rate has also been increased from 60% to 85%, so it can also refine various poor and difficult ores in large quantities, creating a record of completing the entire month's plan in 17 days.

    With the help of the Soviet experts, this copper smelting furnace jointly created by workers and technicians, although still relying on manual operation, its technical level and operating methods have completely broken away from the backward rules of the mud furnace and are close to the international technical standards of mechanical converters.

　　“镁砖炼铜炉”
    ——一个新创造的诞生与成长     
    （续昨）
    华山
    四、技术员和老工人
    去年七月间，陈连高当了制铜股长，所有真吹炉都归他管，改造的劲头更蹩不住了。正好熔炼部新来了一个技术员，陈就找他商量。
    本来，冶炼厂的工人，看着技术人员总是不顺眼。像真吹炉这样的制铜心脏部门，七月份技术室的人只来过三次，总共不到十五分钟。所以厂里有一首歌：“厂上技术员，啥事也不干；成天翻书本，肚皮吃溜圆。”技术员赵启明却不同，他学过采矿和冶金，刚从大学出来，工厂里什么都看着新鲜，常到现场去问这问那，很快便和陈连高谈到一起。听了镁砖造炉的意见，很感兴趣，当时就翻了许多日本书来看。可是，书上说得明白：打从有真吹炉就没人用镁砖做过炉。他也就怀疑起来。及至陈连高说出了四次试验的经过，他又觉得很符合科学道理，终于同意联名请求进行试验。
    这时，厂长的管理方法，已经受到工业部的严厉批评。他这次接到陈和赵的请求书以后，便向工程师征询意见。工程师说，有许多困难不能解决，其中较大的有两个：镁砖传热太快，炉子不能保持一定温度，炼不出铜；炉子改成镁砖后，便不能“自然造渣”，必须从炉口扔进造渣用的金银矿石，但是，每次扔多少拿不稳不说，最严重的是炉子太热，矿石太冷，一扔进去铜熔液便会把矿石凝上层硬壳，不好熔化。如果矿石潮湿，还会引起爆炸。这就造不出渣来。
    陈连高不服气，同赵启明说：“我就不信，泥炉那么薄能保温，镁砖那么厚就不能保温？”赵说：“那不能看厚薄，镁砖就是比泥传热快。”陈说：“原来镁砖是这个性子，今天算学到一条了。可是，咱们就不会在镁砖外面糊上一层保温的东西！”一句话提醒了赵启明：“对，糊上一层焦粉或者黄泥就行，那东西保温！”陈又说：“我看造渣更不成问题：矿石冷不能往炉里扔，咱先把矿石堆在炉口烘热，总该行吧！人老远站着还烘的吃不住哩。一次该扔进多少，更好办，咱天天烧炉，一次拿不准，烧上几炉还拿不准！”赵说：“这不怕，多少铁该配多少矿石，我能计算出来。”——就这样，一个拿出经验，一个拿出理论，把工程师的疑难全部解决了。
    可是厂长的思想总转不过来，试验虽然批准了，镁砖却迟迟不发。直到十月份工业部将该厂领导改组以后，陈连高的心愿这才实现了。给镁砖，给试验的时间，还派工人帮助他们磨砖、砌炉，乐的陈连高和赵启明一口气忙了一个多月。
    这时候，厂里提出了“深入现场，解决问题”的管理方针，号召技术人员与工人结合，以此作为提高生产技术的具体步骤。但是当时大家对这一方针总是不大相信。直到镁砖炉快砌成的时候，还有技术人员当着他们说：“不得了啦！赵启明想搞伟大发明啦！”甚至工人也说：“这也能行，还要工程师干啥？”可是，十一月十三日一开炉，不仅实收率比泥炉提高三分之一，而且铜的品质也显著提高。第一炉就把日本人“一千五百年的心血结晶”压倒了。
    五、新创造带来了新问题
    “工人有经验，技术人员有理论，这么一结合可真了不起。”镁砖炉成了传颂一时的美谈。“深入现场”也开始成为冶炼厂的新风气。半年来全厂三十个技术人员中能够有二十二个和工人共同创造了新纪录，镁砖炉的创造的确是一个良好的开端。
    但是创造的道路却不是平坦的。一连串的新问题跟着来了。
    首先，镁砖炉到底能用多久呢？如果不能久用，成本不就反而比泥炉高了吗？大家没经验，也就不敢改造其他的泥炉了。正好东北工业部在这时候派来了一位苏联技术专家，他一看到这新创造就连声叫好，并且肯定地说：最少可用半年。接着，他又指出新炉的容积还可以扩大，并且帮助工人们重新设计了一个较大的炉样。
    修筑新炉的时候，他看见工人们砍磨几十种不同形状的圆形砖，非常吃力，于是又建议把圆形炉改成方形炉。有的工人就怀疑：方炉内压力不均匀，不会出危险吗？可是，苏联专家说起来怪有把握的，难道苏联有这种方炉子吗？
    苏联专家说：不说苏联，全世界的工业国家，除了日本以外都没有用落后的泥炉的。他虽是冶炼专家，还是第一次看到真吹炉。可是他来冶炼厂的任务，不是照着他熟悉的苏联厂子的样子，另外盖座新的，而是帮助大家想办法把这工厂改造好。经他反复说明以后，厂方和工人便采纳了他的建议，把全部泥炉改成方形镁砖炉。果然，每炉产量又提高了百分之八十，造炉人工也节省了三分之二。
    今年二月，铜矿石又给新炉出了难题：矿场上剩下一大片铅份很高的铜矿，都是日本人没法熔炼而堆积了十三年的。伪满时期的技术规程：含铅百分之六以上的即不提炼。去年冬，当厂里炼了含铅百分之八的铜矿时，工程师就伸舌头。现在要炼，当厂里含铅百分之十的“难矿”，就得用苏联新式转炉那样的大风力，不然就不能把铅完全吹跑。可是，现在的送风机还是早先泥炉用的，而且镁砖炉也不是钢铁包住的大转炉，那能吃得住那样大的风力呢？当苏联专家说声“可以把风压提高一倍”时，好些技术员和工人都吓住了。
    可是，苏联专家说：过去日本人在东北的技术规程，只是为了怎样掠夺更加方便。真吹炉光炼富矿不炼贫矿和“难矿”，便是最省事的掠夺方法。我们不能浪费矿石，就不能按照日本的老规矩办事。他计算了鼓风机的能力和镁砖炉的耐压力以后，便到一千多度高温的炉旁，亲自动手送风。一时炉内风火怒吼，周围的人都直淌冷汗，他却泰然自若，操作成功后仍旧守在炉旁，一直等到大家完全相信可以安全送风时才走了。
    就在苏联专家这种工作方法的帮助下，厂里积存了十三年的“贫矿”“难矿”都全部熔炼了。等到无矿可炼的时候，甚至连含铜极少而含铅较多的烟囱灰、铅冰铜、矿渣、矿场地皮，以至于建厂以来没有动过的垃圾堆也进了熔化大炉，使得三月份的生产量竟达计划的百分之三百三十六。
    六、“事故都是人为的，困难都是可以克服的。”
    四月初，最严重的考验到来了：新到的矿石里，含的铁质比过去的多一倍以上，结果，铁沾到炉壁上就下不来，越沾越厚，任凭你用大锤抡铁焊也敲它不动。这毛病是泥炉从没有过的。到了五月初，已经有三座炉被铁沾的只剩下四分之一的容积了。
    原来，铁要和金银矿石结合成渣，得先让风吹成“氧化铁”。可是风压已经提高了一倍，吹到炉里的氧气也多了，“氧化铁”还没来得及变成渣，又被吹成一种很硬的“过氧化铁”，这种铁要一千二百度的高温才能溶化，可是，炉温最高也只一千一百度，所以铁沾上炉壁就凝成硬块。——困难在这里提出来了：风不大，不能炼难矿，提不高产量；风大了，铁又沾壁，不让镁砖炉活下去。铁成了这个新创造的死敌。
    这时，苏联专家说：“事故都是人为的，困难都是可以克服的；炉子和矿石本身并没过错，过错只是在于我们没想出办法让它们好好地给人工作。”开始提炼这种矿石的时候，苏联专家就建议：这次铁份多，得多加金银矿。可是加的多了，渣子就稀，往外扒渣不顺手，工人们都不按规定进料。等到炉子快被沾死以后，才着急起来，找苏联专家想办法。
    苏联专家说：要不叫铁沾炉，得用两个办法：多加金银矿，提高炉温。他到现场研究结果，发现操作方法还是按着泥炉的习惯，停风时间太长，所以炉温损失很大。比方：扒渣和换风筒的时候，得停了风才能下手干，但是，如果把这两件工作同时进行，每次就能节省二十分钟。又如：往炉里加铜汁，不停风也可以做的。经他这么一计算，送风的时间满可以增加四分之一，泥炉也可以经常保持在一千二百度以上。
    清除炉壁上的铁，他早已出了办法：把生铁放在炉底，再加高热和大风，让生铁燃烧（氧化），发出大量的高热，便可以把沾壁的铁熔化。可是，工人不相信：“铁怎么能燃烧呢？再加铁不更沾壁了吗？”工人不相信，事情就办不好。赵启明于是做了两个试验：把铁片扔到铜汁里，铁片立刻冒出白光；把铁钎插到铜汁里，抽出来钎头还直迸火花，工人们心里一信服，就动手干。陈连高更积极，一口气干了三十五个钟头。——一个多月没见面的炉砖果然都露脸了。
    突破了一连串的困难以后，镁砖炉的风压已经从三十提高到七十，炉温经常保持一千二百度以上，送风率也从百分之六十提高到百分之八十五，因而也可以大量提炼各种贫矿难矿，创造了十七天完成全月计划的纪录。
    在苏联专家的帮助底下，这个由工人和技术员共同创造的炼铜炉，虽然还是依靠人力操作，但它的技术水平和操作方法却已经完全摆脱了泥炉的落后陈规，接近于机械转炉的国际技术标准了。
