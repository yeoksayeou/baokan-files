　　A Large Number of Young Activists Emerge in Rent Reduction and Production
    Millions of Hunan Youth Organized
    Rural Areas in Twenty-Five Counties Begin Key League Building
    [Changsha Dispatch from this Newspaper] Over a million young farmers in Hunan Province have joined the organizations of peasant associations and militia teams, becoming a powerful force in the rent reduction and production movements. In twenty-five counties, including Changsha, Hengyang, Changde, and Shaoyang, youth league organizations have been established in more than 120 townships and guaranties [保], developing over four thousand league members.

    After the launch of the rent reduction movement in the province, young farmers demonstrated a high degree of steadfastness and initiative in the struggle. For example, young farmers in Pingqiao Township, Liling, organized more than ten youth persuasion teams to resolutely struggle against landlords. Tens of thousands of young people organized rent reduction teams to reclaim their grain from landlords. At a mass meeting in Qinghua Township, Changsha, Fifth Guaranty, to struggle against five landlords, nine of the fourteen speakers were young people. Two-thirds of the rent reduction team in that guaranty were young farmers. When the Third Guaranty of Langping Township, Changde, established a militia team, more than sixty young people were the first to sign up. Young farmers not only actively engaged in the struggle against the enemy but also demonstrated a high degree of class solidarity. For example, after their victory in the struggle, the young people of the Third Guaranty of Langping Township, Changde, helped the farmers of the Fourth Guaranty to reason with the landlords for rent reduction. Young farmers in Renxin Township, Third District, Hengyang, proposed "Friendship Grain" from the fruits of their victory to help poor peasant brothers.

    As a large number of young activists emerged from the mass movement, many counties in the province began to focus on establishing the Communist Youth League in rural areas. Young people in various places have been vying to join the League as an honor. For example, after promoting the establishment of the League at the Peasant Representative Conference in Baoyu Township, Qiyang, more than two hundred young people applied to join the League. Young people who joined the League have been even more active in all aspects, leading and uniting the vast number of farmers to advance in the rent reduction and production movements. For example, after taking the lead in the rent reduction movement, the Communist Youth League members of Qinghua Township, Changsha, immediately turned to the production movement. The secretary of the League branch first formulated a production plan for the whole family, including wasteland reclamation, vegetable and early-maturing crop planting, and textile production, and announced the plan at the League branch meeting. Subsequently, thirty-two League members formulated plans, and the next day they reported their plans to the peasant meeting of the guaranty, promoting many farmers in the entire guaranty to formulate production plans. The League members of the guaranty also united the masses to form more than thirty mutual aid groups, basically overcoming the difficulties of insufficient manpower and animal power in production. In addition, they also started a learning movement.

    At present, the Communist Youth League in various places is developing and consolidating its organization, leading and uniting the vast number of young people to further promote various mass movements. Many local governments and peasant associations feel that "with the establishment of the Communist Youth League, the peasant associations and militia are easier to manage." Parents also reflect that "the League is a hundred times better than parents teaching their children."

　　在减租及生产中涌现大批青年积极分子
    湖南百万青年组织起来 
    二十五县农村开始重点建团
    【本报长沙讯】湖南省已有百万以上青年农民参加了农民协会及民兵队的组织，成为减租、生产运动中一支强大的力量。长沙、衡阳、常德、邵阳等二十五县并已在一百二十多个乡保中建立了青年团的组织，发展了团员四千余名。
    该省的减租运动开展后，青年农民在斗争中表现了高度的坚定性与积极性。如醴陵平桥乡青年农民组织了十多个青年说理队，坚决向地主作斗争。数以万计的青年组织了减租队，向地主要回自己的粮食。长沙庆华乡第五保在一次斗争五个地主的群众大会上，十四个发言人中有九名是青年。该保的减租队中有三分之二为青年农民。常德朗平乡三保在建立民兵队时，六十多名青年首先报名参加。青年农民不但积极进行对敌斗争，而且表现了高度的阶级友爱精神。如常德朗平乡三保青年在自己的斗争胜利之后，便帮助四保农民向地主说理减租。衡阳三区仁信乡青年农民从分得的胜利果实中提出“友爱谷”来帮助贫苦的农民兄弟。
    由于大批青年积极分子从群众运动中涌现出来，该省很多县已开始有重点地在农村中建立青年团。各地青年纷纷以争取入团为光荣。如祁阳保语乡在农代会上宣传建团之后，争取入团的青年达二百余人。入团后的青年，在各方面的表现更显得积极了，带领和团结广大农民在减租、生产运动中前进。如长沙庆华乡青年团员在带头进行了减租运动后，立刻又转入生产运动。团支部书记首先订出全家的开荒、种蔬菜和早熟作物、纺织等生产计划，并把计划在团支部大会上宣布。接着三十二个团员订出了计划，第二天并把他们的计划向保农民大会上报告，推动全保许多农民都订了生产计划。该保团员并团结群众组成了三十多个互助小组，基本上克服了生产中人力、畜力不足的困难。此外，他们还搞起了学习运动。
    目前，各地青年团正在发展、巩固组织，领导团结广大青年进一步推动各种群众运动。许多地方政府和农协会感觉到：“青年团建立起来，农协、民兵都好办了。”家长们也反映：“团比爷娘教儿女好百倍。”
