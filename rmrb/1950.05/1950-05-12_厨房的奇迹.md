　　The Miracle of the Kitchen

    (Introducing the working methods of three cooks from Tongxian Women's Normal School)
    The kitchen of Tongxian Women's Normal School has to prepare meals for 380 people every day, but how many cooks are there? Only three. This seems like a miracle to most people. According to general statistics, the average cook in a large kitchen can only prepare meals for a maximum of 70 people.
    Why is such a miracle possible? I spent two days visiting the cooks in the large kitchen to find out that there are three reasons for this miracle: 1. High work enthusiasm; 2. Good management methods; 3. Strict division of labor.
    When I first stepped into the door of the large kitchen, I saw Chen Xiyong and Wang Liang steaming corn buns, and Tian Mao cutting cabbage. They finished mixing the cornmeal, and then busily and skillfully formed the corn buns and put them in the large steamer. According to Chen Xiyong, "We have to steam 200 jin of cornmeal for one meal, which is six large trays, 500 buns." How long does it take to form these 500 buns from mixing the dough? Chen Xiyong's answer was: "One hour." I calculated that, on average, they have to form more than eight buns per minute. This is an amazing number!
    The second time I went to the large kitchen, I saw Chen Xiyong cutting vegetables again, and Tian Mao and Wang Liang steaming corn buns.
    "What's going on? Are your jobs often changed?" I asked.
    They didn't have much time to answer my questions during their busy work, and only pointed to the wall. I saw their own arranged rotating duty roster: cooking, making porridge, adding fuel, carrying basins, washing basins, cutting vegetables...
    I learned that the work in the large kitchen is quite complicated. If the division of labor is not clear and the planning is not thorough, it is easy to cause chaos and uneven distribution of labor. For example, the person who makes porridge has to get up at three o'clock in the morning, but the sleeping time is the same as others. Under this circumstance, it is necessary to have a scientific division of labor and rotating duty. So they made a table themselves, divided the work into three categories, and each person had a nameplate, hung on the duty roster, changed every day, and rotated every three days. For example, if Wang Liang makes porridge today, Chen Xiyong will replace him tomorrow, Tian Mao the day after tomorrow, and Wang Liang will make porridge again on the fourth day. The other two types of work are also the same. Rotating responsibility.
    Is it enough to rely on this one table? Does someone have to push it?
    "Who is your leader?"
    Their answer was: not relying on the leader to manage, but relying on democratic management. The duty roster is stipulated by everyone, and everyone consciously abides by it. Whoever's nameplate is hung there will do that work, without anyone else urging. Let's take making porridge as an example. Whoever is supposed to make porridge gets up on time, 365 days a year. When the breakfast bell rings, hot porridge fills the 47 tables. Not once has the time for breakfast been delayed because the cooks got up late.
    Finally, from my conversation with them, I discovered their work enthusiasm.
    Wang Liang, this young man, had worked as a stoker on a train, and is now an alternate member of the Communist Party. He is very enthusiastic about his work. He said, "You have to put in the spirit of hard work. If it weighs fifty jin, you should treat it as one hundred jin, and naturally it won't feel heavy."
    Tian Mao and Chen Xiyong also said: "We get up in the morning and start working, finishing this and doing that, and unknowingly it's evening."
    This is their attitude towards work. They completed their daily tasks in a tense, pleasant, and conscious manner, creating the miracle of three people making meals for 380 people.

　　厨房的奇迹
　　徐欣华
    （介绍通县女师三个炊事员的工作方法）
    通县女师大厨房每天要作三百八十个人的饭，而炊事员呢？只有三个人。这在一般人看来是一个奇迹。据一般统计，大厨房的炊事员同志，平均每人最多只能作七十个人的饭。
    为什么能有这样的奇迹呢？我曾经花费两天的时间，到大厨房去访问炊事员同志，知道了造成奇迹的原因有三：一、工作热情高；二、管理方法好；三、分工严密。
    当我第一次踏进大厨房的门口时，看见陈希永和王亮在蒸窝头，田茂在切白菜。他们和完了玉米面，紧张而熟练的团着窝头往大笼屉里放。据陈希永说：“一顿饭要蒸二百斤面的窝头，合六大屉，五百个。”这五百个窝头从和面到团得需要多长的时间呢？陈希永的回答是：“一个钟头。”我计算一下，平均一分钟要团八个多窝头。这是多么惊人的数字啊！
    我第二次再去大厨房，又看见陈希永在切菜，田茂和王亮两个人在蒸窝头了。
    “这是怎么回事？你们的工作时常调动吗？”我问。
    他们在紧张的工作中，没有很多的时间来回答我的问题，只用手往墙上一指，我看见了他们自己排的轮流值日表：作菜、熬粥、添火、端盆、刷盆、切菜……。
    我了解到大厨房的工作是相当繁杂的，如果分工不明确，计划不周密，便容易造成忙乱、劳逸不均的现象。譬如熬粥的人吧，清晨三点钟就要起来，睡觉的时间还是和别人一样。在这种情形之下，便有科学分工轮流值日的必要了。于是他们自己制订一个表，把工作分成三类，每人有一个名牌，挂在值日表上，一天一换，三天轮一遭。比如今日王亮熬粥，明天就换陈希永，后天换田茂，第四天又由王亮熬粥了。其他两类工作也是如此。轮流负责。
    只靠这一个表就够了吗？一定要有人推动吧！
    “你们谁是头儿呀？”
    他们的回答是：不是靠头儿管，而是依靠民主管理。值日表是大家规定的，大家便自觉的遵守。自已的牌挂在那里，便作那项工作，不用别人来催。还是拿熬粥来作例子，该谁熬粥，谁就准时起来，三百六十五天如一日。早餐钟一打，热腾腾的粥摆满了四十七桌。没有一次因为炊事员同志起晚了而耽误早点的时间。
    最后，我从和他们的谈话中，发现了他们工作的积极性。
    王亮这个小伙子，在火车上烧过火，现在是共产党候补党员，工作热情很高。他说：“作事得拿出干的精神，五十斤的重量你就当一百斤的去作，自然就不显重了。”
    田茂、陈希永也说：“我们从早晨起来就干活，干完这个干那个，不知不觉便到了晚上。”
    这就是他们对工作的态度。他们在紧张、愉快、自觉中完成了每天的任务，创造了三个人作三百八十人饭的奇迹。
