　　Normal University Affiliated High School and Fu Jen High School Conduct General Learning Inspection
    [This newspaper's report] Normal University Affiliated High School began a school-wide general learning inspection on the 8th of this month. Aside from the teaching plan section, the student learning inspection was completed on the 22nd. Through this inspection, the students' learning has generally improved a step further. Some groups reviewed that their previewing and reviewing in the past was not thorough enough. A certain class discovered the bad habit of "only doing homework when it's due, and only studying when there's an exam." Some students' learning is still not solid enough, and they follow what others read. In order to overcome these shortcomings, the teaching and guidance section, in addition to strictly enforcing the promotion and demotion system and strengthening self-study guidance, also mobilized students to implement supervision and inspection through group mutual assistance. After this general inspection, students generally realized that learning should be meticulous, humble, and serious, and should not be perfunctory. The vast majority of students can grasp self-study time to learn. The two classes of senior high school grade three have also formulated learning plans. (Benliu, Yuan Gong, Ping Ling)
    [This newspaper's report] The Fu Jen High School's teaching and guidance department investigated the learning situation of all students in the school on the 17th and found that students were extremely nervous every month during the monthly exams, and then relaxed afterwards. The exam became a formality. In order to change the above situation, the teaching and guidance department decided to focus on leading students' daily learning in the future; change the exams to irregular ones to overcome the past shortcomings of students not working hard usually and rushing at the last minute before the monthly exams.

　　师大附中、辅仁中学进行学习总检查
    【本报讯】师大附中于本月八日起，进行全校学习总检查。除教学计划部分外，同学方面的学习检查，已于二十二日完毕。通过这次检查，同学们的学习普遍地提高了一步。有的小组检讨出过去预复习不够彻底。某班发现了“交功课才作，考试才温书”的毛病，部分同学的学习还不够踏实，看到别人读什么就跟着读什么。教导处为了克服这些缺点，除严格升降级制度、加强自习指导外，并发动同学，通过小组互助，实行督促检查。经过这次总检查后，同学们普遍的都认识到学习应该细心、虚心、认真，不能敷衍搪塞。绝大多数同学都能抓紧自习时间学习。高中三年级两个班并已订出学习计划。（奔流、袁巩、平零）
    【本报讯】辅仁中学教导课于十七日调查了全校同学的学习情况，发现每逢月考，同学们极度紧张，过后就松弛下来的现象。考试变成了形式。为了改变上述情况，教导课决定今后着重领导同学日常学习；将考试改为不定期，以克服已往同学们平时不用功月考临时赶的缺点。（伯林）
