Bank Deposits Increase, Currency Transactions Common
Renminbi Spreads to Rural Areas in Hebei
Private Industrialists and Businessmen Now Store Currency Instead of Goods

[Our Newspaper] With the stabilization of prices in various parts of Hebei Province, the credit of Renminbi has improved significantly. Bank deposits have increased markedly, and barter trade between urban and rural areas has gradually decreased. Renminbi has penetrated deeply into rural areas, and the demand for currency in many market towns and rural areas has increased. The balance of deposits at the Baoding branch of the People's Bank in March was 12 billion yuan, all of which were current deposits. By April 21, it had increased to 30.4 billion yuan, of which current deposits accounted for only 44 percent of deposits from government agencies and organizations, fixed deposits accounted for 55 percent, and savings deposits indexed to real value accounted for only 1 percent. The ratio of current to fixed deposits was 1 to 1.275.

The rate of currency circulation has decreased significantly. Looking at the figures for private current deposits at the Baoding branch: in January, the average daily balance was 43.93 million yuan, accounting for only 0.2 percent of the total accumulated current deposits for the month. In March, the balance of 86.66 million yuan also accounted for only 0.4 percent of the total accumulated current deposits. In mid-April, the average balance of 83.87 million yuan, however, accounted for 36.39 percent of the accumulated deposits. The total amount of deposits in all branches and offices under the Hebei Provincial Branch has also increased. As of May 9, the total deposit balance in all branches and offices throughout the province reached 157.7 billion yuan, more than double the 70 billion yuan deposit target for the entire province requested by the head office at the national financial conference. Many branches and offices have exceeded the deposit tasks assigned by the provincial branch.

New situations, different from the past, have emerged in small and medium-sized county towns, market towns, and rural areas. Barter trade has gradually decreased. Farmers have changed from fearing currency to being willing to accept and store it. As a result, Renminbi has penetrated deeply into rural areas. For example, in Gaoyang County, barter trade accounted for 80 percent of the total trade volume in February, and in Dawangdian Town, Xushui, barter trade accounted for more than 90 percent. By April 22, barter trade in Dawangdian, Xushui, had dropped to 65 percent, and in Gaoyang, it had dropped to 40 percent. The Fuquan Grocery Store in Dawangdian Town, Xushui, saw that the amount of goods purchased in January this year was 109 percent of the amount of goods sold, but in February it was only 88 percent, and in March it was only 39 percent. In the first half of April, it simply only sold goods and did not buy any. In the past, the Gaoyang Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company paid for weaving labor with a combination of grain and money, and farmers still demanded that they be paid entirely in grain. Now, they demand that they be paid entirely in money and do not want grain. In the past, farmers in Nandaran, Qingyuan, would not sell a pig unless they received twelve dou of wheat. Now, even if given twelve dou of wheat, they refuse to sell and will only sell for money.

According to a survey of eleven farmers who regularly go to market in Xiheishan Village, Xushui County, where there was almost no currency in the past, nine households conducted transactions using currency, and two households still bartered. The nine households collectively earned 97,560 yuan, spent 66,360 yuan, and brought home 31,200 yuan, accounting for one-third of their income. This shows that currency is gradually spreading to rural areas; and many market towns and rural areas feel that they lack sufficient currency. For example, Xisheishan Village in Xushui County urgently needed 5,000 yuan in Renminbi for an urgent matter and had to borrow from nearly twenty households to collect the money, and most of it was in small denominations of 100 or 200 yuan. Therefore, there have been instances of transactions between farmers that could not be completed because "there is grain but no money," indicating that the demand for currency is gradually increasing.

Private industrialists and businessmen in various places have also reversed their past business practices of competing to purchase and hoard goods. Most of the money they earn each day is being stored. According to a survey of 194 industrial and commercial households in 46 trades in Baoding City, the total income on February 3 was 35.655 million yuan, and the total expenditure was 35.738 million yuan, with income and expenditure nearly balanced. However, according to statistics from three industrial and commercial households in the city from April 11 to 15, the average daily income was 1,213,904 yuan, while the inventory was 2,751,648 yuan, equivalent to more than twice the daily income. Among them, the Hengyuan Company had an average daily inventory of only tens of thousands of yuan in early February, but in mid-April, it averaged 1.92 million yuan, and it also deposited another 1.61 million yuan in the bank.

### 银行存款增加货币交易普遍　河北各地人民币下乡　私营工商业已变储存货物为储存货币

　　银行存款增加货币交易普遍
　　河北各地人民币下乡   
    私营工商业已变储存货物为储存货币
    【本报讯】河北省各地物价稳定后，人民币信用提高，银行存款显著增加，城乡间物物交换逐渐减少，人民币已深入农村，不少集镇与农村需要货币量增加。人民银行保定分行三月份存款余额为一二○亿，且均系活期；到四月二十一日，增至三○四亿，其中机关团体存款中活期存款仅占百分之四四，定期存款占百分之五五，折实储蓄仅占百分之一。活期与定期存款为一与一·二七五之比。
    货币流转速率大减，从保定分行私营活存数字看：一月份，每日平均余额为四、三九三万元占全月活期存款累计额百分之○·二；三月份余额八、六六六万元亦仅占活期存款累计额百分之○·四；四月中旬平均余额为八、三八七万元却占存入累计额百分之三六·三九。河北省分行所属各行处存款总额亦有增加，截至五月九日止，全省各行处总的存款余额已达一、五七七亿元，超过总行在全国金融会议上要求全省吸收存款七百亿元的一倍多。其中不少行处并超过省分行所分配的存款任务。
    各中小县城和集镇及农村已出现了与过去不同的新局面，物物交换逐渐减少，农民由怕票子转为愿要票子与存票子，因之人民币已深入农村。如高阳县城二月份物物交换占交易总额百分之八○，徐水大王店镇物物交换占百分之九十以上。到四月二十二日徐水大王店物物交换降至百分之六十五，高阳降至百分之四十。徐水大王店镇福全杂货店，今年一月买货金额是卖货金额的百分之一○九，二月份仅百分之八八，三月份就仅百分之三九，到四月上半月干脆只卖不买了。高阳花纱布公司支付织布手工，过去给一部分粮一部分款，农民尚要求全部发粮，现在则要求全部发款而不要粮了。清苑南大冉农民过去卖一口猪，非要十二斗麦子不可，而今给十二斗麦子，却反而不卖，非要票子才卖。
    据徐水县西黑山村过去几乎完全没有货币，但现就该村十一个赶集户调查结果，有九户通过货币交易，二户仍以物易物，九户共收入九七、五六○元，支出六六、三六○元，带回家的三一、二○○元，占收入三分之一。这说明了货币已在陆续下乡；且许多集镇及农村均感筹码不足，就如徐水西黑山村因急事需人民币五千元，借了近二十家才凑起，且多系一、二百元之零钞。故有的村农民间的交易已有因“有粮食没有票子”而未能成交的现象发生，需要货币量是逐渐增加了。
    各地私营工商业亦已一反过去争购囤积的经营方式。每日卖进的钱大多储存起来了。根据保定市四六行业、一九四户工商户调查，二月三日一天总收入三五、六五五万元，总支出为三五、七三八万元，收支近于平衡；而四月十一日至十五日就该市三家工商户统计，平均每日收入一、二一三、九○四元，而库存却为二、七五一、六四八元，相当于每日收入二倍多。其中之恒源号，二月上旬每天库存仅几万元，四月中旬每天平均即为一九二万元，且另以一六一万元存入银行。
