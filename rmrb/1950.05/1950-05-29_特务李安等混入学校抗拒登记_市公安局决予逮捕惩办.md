　　Special Agents Li An and Others Infiltrated Schools, Resisting Registration; Municipal Public Security Bureau Decides to Arrest and Punish

    [Our Newspaper] The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau on the 19th continued to arrest seven Kuomintang bandit special agent elements, including Li An and Wang Zemin, who had infiltrated various universities and resisted registration for a new start, in accordance with the law.

    The bandit special agent Li An, as early as 1946, had already joined the special agent boss Liu Jihong at Northwest University, organizing the reactionary School Protection Corps. The criminal Li served as the captain of the disciplinary team, specializing in persecuting progressive students. On April 24 of that year alone, he colluded with special agents from the pseudo-Shaanxi-Southern Shaanxi Garrison Headquarters to arrest more than ten progressive students. Wang Zemin was a special agent of the bandit "Military Statistics Bureau." Before liberation, he specialized in plainclothes inspections at Dongzhimen, committing numerous crimes of harassing the masses. After liberation, the two criminals successively infiltrated Renmin University of China, plotting to carry out sabotage activities. The bandit "Military Statistics Bureau" special agent Yu Lijiainfiltrated Fu Jen Catholic University before liberation, organizing peripheral groups such as the "Dinghai Society" and the "Social Construction Society" for the "Military Statistics Bureau," propagating for the bandits. On August 19, 1948, he and the special agent Li Yong'an, who had infiltrated the school and served as the head of the training section, reported a "blacklist" of progressive students to the special agent agency. Criminal Li also colluded with the pseudo-military police to arrest three students from the school, including Sun Shuqian. The bandit "Central Statistics Bureau Mobile Unit" special agent Wu Guohua infiltrated Jiaotong University Pingyuan (Railway Management College) before liberation. Under the instructions of the pseudo-Beiping Municipal Garrison Headquarters, he consistently suppressed student movements and threatened and forced students of the school to sign against righteous strikes. The bandit "Central Statistics Bureau" special agent Zhu Zenghang was in charge of the bandit Youth Army Friendship Association at Jiaotong University Pingyuan before liberation, frequently monitoring and following progressive students and reporting to the special agent agency. The bandit "Central Statistics Bureau" special agent Zhou Guangwei not only persecuted progressive students and suppressed student movements at Normal University before liberation, but also continued to spread rumors and sabotage after liberation, and plotted to lie dormant and continue criminal activities.

    The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, in accordance with the regulations of the People's Government to maintain school safety and giving special agents and reactionary party members and elements lurking in universities and colleges in Beijing the opportunity to start anew, organized this registration. To date, many special agents and reactionary party members and elements have registered to start anew, but the Municipal Public Security Bureau has decided to arrest and severely punish these special agents and major reactionary party members and elements who show no signs of repentance.

    京市公安局遵照人民政府维护学校安全的法令，并给予潜伏于京市各专科以上学校的特务及反动党团分子自新的机会，乃举办此次登记，迄今为止，已有不少的特务及反动党团分子登记自新，但市公安局对这些毫无改悔之心的特务及主要反动党团分子则决予逮捕严惩。
