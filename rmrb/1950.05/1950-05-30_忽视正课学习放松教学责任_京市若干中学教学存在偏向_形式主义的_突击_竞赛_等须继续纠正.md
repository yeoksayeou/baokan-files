　　Neglecting Regular Coursework and Relaxing Teaching Responsibilities
    Teaching in Several Middle Schools in Beijing Shows a Tendency Towards Formalism
    "Crash Courses," "Competitions," etc., of a Formalistic Nature Must Continue to Be Corrected
    [Our Newspaper] Reporter Mu Yang reports: The teaching work in many public and private middle schools in Beijing still suffers from a serious tendency towards formalism. At the beginning of this semester, the Municipal Government's Bureau of Culture and Education emphatically criticized the "Striving for Red Flags" and "Striving to be Models" and other crash course competition movements launched by various schools last year, which hindered regular learning. At that time, the main manifestation of this tendency was the neglect of regular coursework. For example, one school stipulated that the score ratio for model students was: "Learning accounts for 20 percent, learning order accounts for 50 percent, public morality, mass relations, responding to administrative calls, social services, attending large lectures, and cleaning account for 30 percent." In order to strive for first place in everything, a senior high school class in a girls' middle school selected several students to specialize in crash courses whenever a movement was launched. They won four first places in six movements and became model classes for the whole school; however, the overall academic performance of the whole class lagged behind other classes. In order to show collective spirit, a junior high school class stipulated that one person being late for class would deduct points from the whole group; if the whole group attended a large report, points would be added to the whole group. An individual study group in a private girls' middle school stipulated: "Failure to speak at a discussion meeting will be punished."
    In response to the above tendencies, the Bureau of Culture and Education reminded all schools to pay attention to correction at the beginning of the last semester. However, many school administrators did not pay enough attention to this instruction. They believed that "competition" or "movement" was only a matter of terminology, and the deviations within them were inevitable "by-products" of progress. Even today, many schools still have serious formalistic tendencies. Taking Municipal No. 4 Middle School as an example, the students' activities in learning, life, and other aspects of life, are mostly done through groups. This practice of being collective for the sake of being collective, and excessively restraining students, has caused adverse consequences in teaching. Each class in the school generally has "subject representatives" for Chinese, Russian, Chemistry, Mathematics, Algebra, Geometry, and other subjects, who are selected by the students. Some teachers only correct the homework of the subject representatives; the subject representatives correct the group leaders'; and the group leaders correct the students'. Or the teachers correct the group leaders' homework, and then the students correct it according to the group leaders' corrections. Once, when a group leader in Junior High School Class B was sick, the students' homework was backlogged. A representative in Senior High School Class C corrected the students' exercises incorrectly, and three students answered incorrectly on the exam as well, following the incorrect corrections. Similar situations exist in many other schools. Some teachers in these schools, and even the school leaders, mistakenly believe that this method of abandoning teaching responsibilities is the "mass line" in teaching, or interpret it as cultivating "small cadres." They do not realize that these formalistic and excessively collective practices are actually irresponsible to the students.
    Since the liberation of Beijing, all public and private middle schools have made significant progress compared to the past. For example, Municipal No. 4 Middle School implemented a full-time system in the last semester, and gradually enriched the work content of full-time teachers, implemented the system of combining teaching and guidance, and implemented the class teacher system. This is very correct. Due to the organized political study for teachers and the establishment of subject-based professional learning organizations, teachers generally have the desire to improve teaching and management systems. Other municipal middle schools and some private middle schools have also undergone varying degrees of change. However, due to the lack of experience of some school leaders, as well as the one-sidedness in their thinking, coupled with the overly urgent demands for improvement (such as various crash course competitions in the last semester), the above-mentioned formalistic deviations have arisen. Improving teaching is a long-term and very meticulous task, and a gradual approach should be adopted. In this way, the formalistic deviations will be reduced and can be gradually avoided.

　　忽视正课学习放松教学责任
    京市若干中学教学存在偏向
    形式主义的“突击”“竞赛”等须继续纠正
    【本报讯】记者穆扬报道：京市不少公私立中等学校的教学工作，仍然存在严重的形式主义偏向。本学期开学之初，市府文教局曾经着重地批判了去年各校发起的“争红旗”、“争模范”等妨害正规学习的突击竞赛运动。当时，这一偏向的主要表现是忽视正课学习。如某校曾规定模范学生的分数比例为：“学习占百分之二十，学习秩序占百分之五十，公德、群众关系、响应行政号召、社会服务、听大课、清洁占百分之三十”。某女中高三班为了样样争第一，每当一个运动布置下来，就推选几位同学，专门突击，她们在六种运动中争取了四个第一，成为全校的模范班；但全班总的学习成绩，却落于其他班之后。某校初三班为表现集体精神，曾规定：上课时一人迟到扣全组分数；听大报告时，若能全组出席，给全组增加分数。某私立女中的个别学习小组，曾规定：“在讨论会上不发言就受处罚”。
    针对以上偏向，文教局在上学期开学时，就提示各校注意纠正。但不少学校的行政人员，对于这一指示并未予以足够的注意。他们认为：“竞赛”或“运动”仅是名词问题，其中的偏向是进步中不可避免的“副产品”。直到今天，不少学校还存在着严重的形式主义的偏向。以市立四中为例，该校同学在学习、生活等方面的活动，大都要通过小组来做。这种为集体而集体、过分约束学生的作法，曾造成教学上的不良后果。该校各班普遍设有由同学担任的国文、俄文、化学、数学、代数、几何等课的“科代表”。有些教师在批改作业时，只改科代表的；科代表改小组长的；小组长再分别改同学的。或是教师批改组长的作业，再由同学照组长的改正。有一次，初二乙班某组长病了，同学的作业就被积压下来。高二丙班某代表把同学的练习题改错了，考试时有三位同学也照着错的答错了。其他许多学校也存在着类似的情况。这些学校中某些教师，甚至学校的负责人，竟错误地认为这种放弃教学责任的办法，是教学中的“群众路线”，或解释为培养“小干部”。而没有认识到这些形式主义与过分集体的作法，实际上是对学生不负责任。
    北京解放迄今，各公私立中学较前都有显著进步。例如市立四中，在上学期实行了专任制度，并逐渐充实了专任教员的工作内容，贯彻了教导合一的制度，实行了级任制。这是很对的。由于有领导地组织了教员政治学习，建立了各科业务学习组织，使教员普遍地有了改进教学、改进管理制度的要求。其他市立中学以及部分私立中学，也都有着不同程度的改变。但是，由于某些学校负责人缺乏经验，以及由于思想上存在的片面性，再加上对改进工作的要求过于迫切（如上学期各种突击性的竞赛等），这就产生了上述形式主义的偏向。改进教学是一个长期的非常细致的工作，应该采取循序渐进的方法。这样，形式主义的偏向就会减少，并可以逐渐避免了。
