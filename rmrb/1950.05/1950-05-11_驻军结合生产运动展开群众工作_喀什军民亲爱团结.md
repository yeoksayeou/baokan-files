Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 9th: A certain unit of the Kashgar garrison in southern Xinjiang, combined with the production movement, actively carried out mass work and helped the impoverished Uyghur people with production, making the relationship between the army and the people even closer. After entering the reclamation area, each unit extensively carried out propaganda and education among the people in the stationed area. A certain regiment held 24 mass meetings on both sides of the Kashgar River, with a total of more than 3,000 people participating. At the meetings, various policies were publicized, various disputes among local residents were resolved, and agricultural and water conservancy surveys were conducted. Each unit also allocated land and seeds to help impoverished Uyghur compatriots establish households. A certain regiment allocated three to four mu of good paddy fields to poor farmers; a certain battalion used 30 workers to help poor farmer Zilaike open 10 mu of land; a certain regiment's machine gun company helped poor residents in the stationed area with seeds for 50 mu of spring wheat, and gave priority to residents in the use of the two newly dug irrigation canals. Some troops donated money or gave cattle and sheep to help farmers expand production. Therefore, the Uyghur compatriots in the area deeply love the People's Liberation Army. Some traveled from twenty to thirty li away to the troop's station to request their help in resolving disputes. Many farmers voluntarily taught the soldiers how to repair canals, build weirs, build dams, and irrigate, and automatically mobilized donkeys and camels to help the troops transport grain. The army and people in a certain garrison area cooperated closely to jointly build the 20-li-long Jipu River canal and five large dams, irrigating more than 10,000 mu of land. The troops and residents each selected five people to form a water conservancy committee to manage the water conservancy of the canal. A scene of close unity between the army and people is presented throughout the Kashgar area.

　　驻军结合生产运动展开群众工作
    喀什军民亲爱团结
    【新华社迪化九日电】南疆喀什驻军某部结合生产运动，积极展开群众工作，帮助维吾尔族贫苦人民生产，使军民关系更加融洽。各部进入垦区后，即向驻地人民广泛展开宣传教育。某团先后在喀什噶尔河两岸召开了二十四次群众大会，共有三千余人参加。在会上，宣传了各项政策，帮助解决了当地居民间的各种纠纷，并进行了农业、水利的调查。各单位并调剂出土地和种籽，帮助贫苦维族同胞建立家务。某团各单位抽出三至四亩好稻田给贫苦农民；某营用三十个工帮助贫农自来克开地十亩；某团机炮连以五十亩春麦的籽种帮助驻地贫苦居民，并把刚挖好的两道新水渠先让给居民使用。有的部队则纷纷捐款或赠送牛、羊，帮助农民扩大生产。因此该区维族同胞对解放军极为爱戴。有的从二三十里外赶到部队驻地来，请求给他们解决纠纷。很多农民自动教给战士们修渠、打堰、修坝及浇水的方法，并且自动动员毛驴和骆驼帮助部队运粮。某驻营地军民亲密合作，共同修通了二十里路长的己普河大渠及五个大水坝，使万余亩地得到灌溉，并由部队和居民各选出五人组成水利委员会管理该渠水利。喀什全区军民之间呈现一片亲爱团结的景象。
