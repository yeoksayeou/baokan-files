[Kaifeng News] According to the Henan Daily, Chang Xiuhai, a worker at the Kaifeng City Relief Institute People's Factory, published a criticism in the Henan Daily's Social Services column on April 24th regarding the serious extravagance and waste at the Kaifeng Industrial Company Weaving Factory (this factory is a newly built public factory, originally belonging to the Relief Institute, and was placed under the leadership of the Industrial Company in March). The criticism pointed out that Nan Huatang, the weaving factory's accountant, unnecessarily purchased many luxurious office supplies, resulting in public funds spent far exceeding the original budget for ordinary supplies. Chang Xiuhai's criticism was stern and well-intentioned, aimed at correcting wasteful practices in public enterprises. After this criticism was published, Dou Xiuyan, the director of the weaving factory, not only did not immediately accept it and investigate and correct the waste, but instead suppressed the criticism, summoning Chang Xiuhai and subjecting him to ridicule and abuse. Chang Xiuhai reflected this situation once again to the Henan Daily, requesting support for his criticism and demanding that the criticism continue "until the errors and shortcomings are corrected." The Henan Daily supported Chang Xiuhai's opinion, publishing Chang Xiuhai's second letter on the 26th, and pointed out in the "Editor's Note": The behavior of Weaving Factory Director Dou Xiuyan in attempting to suppress criticism violated the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" and the News Administration's "Decision on Improving Newspaper Work," and demanded that the leaders of the Kaifeng City Industrial Company seriously and promptly conduct a responsible investigation and handling of this incident. This incident attracted the attention of the local CPC Committee, the People's Government, mass organizations, and various parties. The Henan Daily received letters from the Henan Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, the Kaifeng City Federation of Trade Unions, and some agency cadres, all expressing dissatisfaction with Dou Xiuyan's erroneous behavior and firmly supporting Chang Xiuhai's correct criticism. The CPC Henan Provincial Committee and the Henan Provincial People's Government both issued notices on May 1st, instructing the Kaifeng Municipal Committee and the Kaifeng Municipal People's Government to investigate and handle this incident, respectively, to ensure the implementation of the decisions of the CPC Central Committee and the News Administration, and to ensure the democratic and legal rights of the people. Wang Xiaozhou, Deputy Mayor of Kaifeng City, Zhuang Yuming, Director of the Labor Bureau, Liu Mingyuan, Director of the Industry and Commerce Bureau and Manager of the Industrial Company, and Yang Zhichao, Deputy Director of the Industry and Commerce Bureau and Deputy Manager of the Industrial Company, successively went to the weaving factory to conduct investigations and research, confirming that Chang Xiuhai's criticism was basically correct and investigating the facts of Dou Xiuyan's suppression of criticism. Subsequently, the CPC Kaifeng Municipal Committee made a decision, pointing out Dou Xiuyan's mistake in suppressing worker criticism, in addition to helping him seriously correct his mistakes, immediately inspecting and correcting the extravagance and waste, and giving him a public warning. The Kaifeng Municipal People's Government also, upon submitting a request to the Provincial Government for approval, gave Dou Xiuyan a demerit and ordered the Industrial Company to improve its management work, earnestly correct the waste, and give appropriate punishment to the accountant Nan Huatang, who directly caused the waste and loss. Dou Xiuyan also reviewed his mistakes, stated that he accepted the punishment of the Party and the People's Government, and expressed his intention to correct his mistakes in his work. The above-mentioned inspection process and the decisions of the CPC Kaifeng Municipal Committee and the Municipal Government were all publicly published in the Henan Daily on May 7th.

    【开封讯】据河南日报消息：开封市救济院人民工厂工人常秀海，在四月二十四日河南日报社会服务栏发表了对于开封实业公司织布厂（该厂为新建的公营工厂，原属救济院，三月份划归实业公司领导）严重铺张浪费现象的批评。批评指出：织布厂会计南华堂毫无必要的购买了许多华丽的办公用具，以致花费的公款较之原来购买普通用具的预算超出很多。常秀海的批评是严正的，又是善意的，其目的是为了纠正公营企业中的浪费现象。此一批评发表后，织布厂厂长窦秀岩不独不立即接受，检查纠正浪费现象，反而压制批评，竟将常秀海叫去，加以嘲笑和谩骂。常秀海将这一情况再一次反映给河南日报，要求支持他的批评，要求将批评进行到“错误与缺点得到纠正了为止”。河南日报支持常秀海的意见，于二十六日发表了常秀海的第二次来信，并在“编者的话”中指出：织布厂长窦秀岩这种企图压制批评的行为，违反了中共中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评与自我批评的决定”和新闻总署“关于改进报纸工作的决定”，要求开封市实业公司领导上严肃地、及时地对这一事件作负责的检查与处理。此一事件引起了当地中共党委、人民政府、群众团体和各方的注意。河南日报迭连接到河南省总工会、开封市总工会以及一部分机关干部的来信，一致对窦秀岩的错误行为表示不满，坚决支持常秀海的正确批评。中共河南省委、河南省人民政府均为此于五月一日发出通知，分别指示开封市委与开封市人民政府对这一事件进行检查处理，以保证贯彻中共中央与新闻总署的决定，保证人民大众的民主合法权利。开封市副市长王晓舟、劳动局长庄玉铭，工商局长兼实业公司经理刘明远、副局长兼实业公司副经理杨志超等，先后到织布厂进行了检查研究，确认常秀海的批评基本上是正确的，并调查了窦秀岩压制批评的事实。接着，中共开封市委作出了决定，指出窦秀岩压制工人批评的错误，除帮助其认真改正错误，立即检查纠正铺张浪费现象外，并予以当众警告处分。开封市人民政府亦经呈请省府核准，予窦秀岩以记过处分，并责成实业公司改进管理工作，切实纠正浪费现象，并对直接造成浪费损失的会计南华堂予以适当处分。窦秀岩亦检讨了自己的错误，申明接受党和人民政府的处分，并表示在工作中改正错误，上述检查经过与中共开封市委，市府的决定等，均在河南日报五月七日公开发表。
