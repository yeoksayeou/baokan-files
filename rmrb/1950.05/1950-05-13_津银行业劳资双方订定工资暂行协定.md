　　Tianjin Banking Industry Labor and Management Reach Provisional Wage Agreement

    [This Newspaper's News] Tianjin Daily News: Private banking employees in Tianjin have reached a provisional wage agreement with the capitalists, which has been approved by the Labor Bureau. The main spirit of this agreement is to make personnel expenditures suitable for business conditions, so as to stabilize the management mood of both parties and improve business.

    Before liberation, there were 26 banks in Tianjin, most of which had their head offices or general management offices in Shanghai. All issues of each bank were planned uniformly by their respective head offices, so the wage standards of each bank varied. However, their wages were based on a base salary monetary system, and the level of welfare was the same. After liberation, due to changes in the entire social and economic system, some banks' old speculative practices and outdated management methods could not adapt to the new situation, and business once showed a downturn. Since April last year, after the business of various banks has been on the right track, they have successively converted monetary wages into real terms (corn flour, millet, real unit) for distribution. By the end of February this year, due to abnormal business and poor management of some banks, huge personnel expenditures formed a serious phenomenon of eating into capital. Six banks successively closed down, 13 suffered losses, and only 7 had normal business.

    In order to take care of long-term interests, the Banking and Money Industry Union launched employees in early March to take the initiative to negotiate a wage agreement with the capitalists. After several consultations and studies, all agreements were reached.

    The wage agreement first reasonably stipulated the ratio of wage standards to gross profit, so as to implement the spirit of mutual benefit for labor and capital. The agreement stipulates a wage base of 85 real units that can maintain the lives of two adults and two children, ensuring the minimum living standard of employees; it also stipulates that if the percentage of gross profit accounted for by the total wage is not sufficient to cover wage expenditures, in addition to paying employees the wage base, the remaining portion can be discounted proportionally. If even the wage base cannot be paid, labor and management can negotiate separately. This has laid a good foundation for overcoming difficulties and continuing to maintain business when business is not prosperous.

    In the process of signing this agreement, the past "eat it all up" mentality and indifference to management of some units in the industry have also begun to change. The general managers of the Dalu and Jin Cheng banks have come from Shanghai and Hong Kong to reorganize Tianjin's business. Dalu has also organized a business promotion association, and Zhongnan has recently hired a deputy manager to strengthen leadership. In order to reduce expenditures, the labor side has drafted a draft conservation agreement, preparing to make further efforts to thoroughly improve business.

### 津银行业劳资双方订定工资暂行协定

　　津银行业劳资双方订定工资暂行协定
    【本报讯】天津日报消息：天津市私营银行业职工，已与资方订定工资暂行协定，并获得劳动局批准。该协定主要精神是使人事开支适合于营业情况，进而达到稳定双方经营情绪，改善业务的目的。
    解放以前，津市共有银行二十六家，其总行或总管理处多设上海。各银行一切问题均由各该总行统一计划，因此各行工资标准高低不一。但其工资为底薪货币制，福利之高，则均相同。解放后，由于整个社会经济制度的变化，部分银行旧日投机倒把作风与陈旧的经营方式，不能适应新的情况，业务曾一度呈现萧条。自去年四月，各行营业步入正轨后，即先后将货币工资折实（玉米面、小米、折实单位）发放。至今年二月底，由于业务不正常，部分银行又经营不善，人事开支浩巨，形成严重的吃本现象。六家银行相继歇业，亏损者十三家，业务正常者仅七家。
    银钱业工会为了照顾长远利益，于三月初即发动职工，主动与资方商订工资协定，几经磋商研究，始全部获得协议。
    该项工资协定，首先是合理地规定了工资标准占毛利的比例数，使能贯彻劳资两利的精神。协定规定了能维持两个大人两个小孩生活的八十五个折实单位的工资基数，对职工最低生活，有了保障；同时也规定了工资总额所占毛利百分数如不敷工资开支时，除发给职工工资基数外，其余部分可依照比例折扣发给。如连工资基数也实在无法发给时，劳资双方可另行协议。这就为营业不景气时，能渡过难关，继续维持营业，奠下了良好的条件。
    在这个协定签订的过程中，该业部分单位的劳资双方过去“吃完再说”的思想和对经营漠不关心的态度也开始转变。大陆、金城的总经理已分别由沪、港北来，积极整顿津行业务，大陆且已组织了业务促进会，中南并于最近增聘一副理，加强领导。劳方为了减少开支，已拟出节约协定草案，预备为彻底搞好业务作进一步的努力。
