　　Preparing to Convene the District People's Representative Conference
　  Preparatory Committee Established for the Sixth District
    [Beijing News Agency Report] The preparatory work for convening the District People's Representative Conference in the Sixth District of Beijing (formerly Districts Eight and Nine) is largely complete, and the preparatory committee was formally established on the 17th. The method for electing representatives has been approved and implemented by the Beijing Municipal People's Government. In addition to the representatives of various people's organizations, government agencies, schools, and stationed troops within the district being selected by their respective units, the election of street resident representatives (including industrial and commercial households) is now underway. It is planned to convene street representative conferences in each police station jurisdiction to elect one or two district people's representatives to attend the upcoming district representative conference.
    The preparatory committee consists of fifteen representatives from various people's organizations within the district, invited by the district public office. At the inaugural meeting of the preparatory committee, Li Rui, secretary of the Sixth District Committee of the Communist Party of China in Beijing, was elected as the chairman, and Zhang Zirong, deputy director of the district trade union office, and Li Yanzhi, director of the Beijing Dried and Fresh Fruit Industry Association, were elected as vice chairmen. The preparatory committee also heard a work report from Gao Yunchao, the district head, on the preparations for convening the district people's representative conference. Since the adoption of the resolution on convening district people's representative conferences at the Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, the Sixth District has carried out publicity and investigation work. The former district public offices of the Eighth and Ninth Districts separately convened cadre meetings and mass rallies to convey the resolution of the Municipal People's Representative Conference. Representatives from all walks of life in the district who attended the Municipal People's Representative Conference also conducted similar dissemination activities within their respective organizations. The district public office also conducted extensive publicity in adult night schools and workers' night schools, and in early April, it formed nine working groups to conduct in-depth investigations and visits to residential areas, commercial areas, and handicraft areas, extensively collecting opinions from all sectors of the people. Based on these opinions and the instructions of the Municipal People's Government, the Sixth District formulated a work plan for the summer and autumn seasons (April to September) and will listen to criticisms and suggestions from representatives of all walks of life regarding this work plan at this representative conference. At the same time, based on the opinions of the people, the district public office studied three major issues: road repair, public health, and housing renovation, and prepared proposals to be submitted to the district people's representative conference for discussion.
