　　Correcting an Error
    Guo Moruo
    In the broadcast speech "Consolidating Revolutionary Victory and Defending Lasting Peace" that I delivered on the Central People's Broadcasting Station on the evening of the thirteenth, there were significant errors in the figures regarding the budgets and military expenditures of the United States, Britain, France, and Italy. I primarily based them on the figures cited in Comrade Ye Yiqun's article "Striving for World Peace" in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao's Sunday supplement on April 30th. Having no other data at hand at the time, and without careful consideration, I used the incorrect figures. The稿子 (manuscript/draft) that Xinhua News Agency sent to major cities inside and outside Beijing was corrected. However, newspapers within Beijing, due to time constraints, published it based on my original draft. I now request that all newspapers publish the following correction, and I hope that listeners of my broadcast and readers of newspapers within Beijing will take note.
    "First and foremost is American imperialism. In the 1949-1950 national budget of 43.3 billion US dollars, direct military expenditure accounts for 13.1 billion US dollars... Adding in the costs of atomic weapons manufacturing and military supplementary expenses, the total military expenditure reaches 21.9 billion US dollars, accounting for 51 percent of the total budget...
    ...Britain's budget for 1949-50 is 760 million pounds, an increase of 70 million pounds over the previous year; France's is 600 billion francs, and Italy's is 370 billion lire...

　　更正一个错误
    郭沫若
    十三日晚在中央人民广播电台发表的广播演讲《巩固革命胜利与保卫持久和平》，中间关于美英法意的预算和军费在数目字上有很大的错误。我主要是依据上海大公报四月三十日星期论文叶以群同志的《争取世界和平》一文所引列的。一时手中没有别的资料，更没有过细考虑，便将错就错地引用了。新华社发到京外各大城市的稿子则是经过改正了的。但京内各报因时间迫促，是依照我的原稿登出的。我现在请求各报登出下面这个更正，希望听了我的广播词的和京内各报的读者注意。
    “首先是美国帝国主义，在一九四九——一九五○年的国家预算四百三十三亿美元的总额中，直接军费占一百三十一亿美元，……再加上原子武器制造费和军人辅助费等全部军费达到二百一十九亿美元，占总预算百分之五十一……。
    ……英国在一九四九——五○年度为七亿六千万镑，比上一个年度增加了七千万镑，法国是六千亿法郎，意大利是三千七百亿里拉……
