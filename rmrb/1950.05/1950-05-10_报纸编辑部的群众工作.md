　　The Mass Work of Newspaper Editorial Departments
    Ge Liebniev

    IV

    What methods must be adopted to fundamentally improve the work of newspaper editorial departments with authors, activists, worker correspondents, and rural correspondents?

    First, the structure of the editorial department should be shifted towards daily effective work with authors. Attention should be paid to the famous resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) "On the Organization of Provincial, Regional, and Republican Newspapers" of July 25, 1940. The resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) stipulates that newspaper editors must "…fundamentally reorganize the work of the editorial department's structure, making it a primary task to absorb a wide range of non-editorial activists to do newspaper work, and to cultivate and educate new cadres of worker and rural correspondents." (Compilation of "Resolutions of the Party on Newspapers," page 193)

    Secondly, the resolution states the tasks of newspaper special correspondents in the following way: "It is considered the primary task of special correspondents to organize a broad group of non-editorial author activists around the newspaper, and to absorb staff members of Party, Soviet, and economic organizations, Soviet intellectuals, workers, and rural correspondents to participate in the work of the newspaper." (Ibid.)

    Some editorial staff members have forgotten these instructions. For example, the twelve special correspondents of "Red Tartar Newspaper" submitted only twenty-four communications and short messages from author activists in the first three months of 1948!

    The newspaper editor must organize this work in such a way that every editorial department colleague believes that—in addition to individual writing activities—absorbing non-editorial author activists, and educating and cultivating worker and rural correspondents is the most important task.

    It must be understood that absorbing author activists to participate in newspaper work—is the fundamental problem in our newspaper work.

    Local Party organizations should create a climate in which the vast groups of Party activists and ordinary Party members must all participate in running the newspaper.

    Lenin always regarded writing work as an integral part of general Party work. He wrote: All Party members should participate in running the newspaper. Lenin first demanded that Party organizations and Party staff members support and participate in Bolshevik publishing organs in writing.

    Vladimir Ilyich resolutely opposed the bourgeois habit of thinking that the work of writers and reporters lies in writing, and the work of readers lies in reading. He ridiculed the half-Oblomov (the protagonist of Goncharov's novel "Oblomov"), half-merchant principle: "The author writes, the reader reads." Lenin wrote: "It is a wrong idea, as if only journalists and only journalists (i.e., those who take this as a profession) can smoothly participate in the work of the organ newspaper. On the contrary, the organ newspaper will only be lively and vigorous when the needs of five leading, regular writing reporters are supplied—by five hundred or even five thousand non-reporter staff members." (Complete Works of Lenin, 4th edition, Volume 7, page 490)

    If the newspaper editorial department is closely linked with activists, if it constantly promotes the noble desire of workers, collective farm members, and intellectuals to publish, then broad prospects for business will be opened up before the newspaper. Conversely, if the newspaper editorial department is divorced from the people, divorced from correspondents and activists, the newspaper will begin to decline and even perish.

    In 1924, Comrade Stalin, in congratulating the "Peasant Newspaper," wrote that the first rule of the newspaper is—to cherish its rural correspondents as if cherishing one's own eyes. Comrade Stalin instructed the "Peasant Newspaper" that rural correspondents are the victorious army of the newspaper, the mainstay of the newspaper.

    The second method to improve and expand the connection with correspondents and activists is to quickly end the formalistic attitude towards the work of authors.

    One manifestation of this formalism is the practice of having internal colleagues of the newspaper write articles in place of Party, Soviet, and economic workers. This practice has taken root in some editorial departments, directly violating the tradition of Bolshevik newspapers and bringing great harm to our newspapers. Where is the harm of this bad practice?

    First, the editorial department is wrong when our cadres give up the responsibility of synthesizing the experience of economic construction and the experience of Party and state work in the newspaper. In fact, what often happens here? For example, the editorial department wants to publish an article by the director of a factory. To achieve this goal, it sends one of its staff members to that factory. He arrives there, obtains various reports, records, and materials from the factory's management department, writes an article based on these materials, and gives it to the factory director for signature. How can this be called commissioned, creative work by a non-editorial author? But it should be known that before the factory director publishes an article in the newspaper, he must seriously consider various issues of the factory's work, synthesize concrete facts and phenomena, give them a good analysis, and carefully study the experience of economic work. Only in such cases can an article be written that brings benefits, is educational, and is rich in content.

    Second, the practice of replacing the commissioned, creative writing of author activists with the writing of reporters weakens the content of the newspaper and lowers its standards. Some newspapers lack the necessary knowledge of business, but frequently and completely without consideration discuss issues of economic, cultural, and Party work.

    Unfortunately, there are still many newspaper workers here who think that everything is fine, that they know everything, and that they can write articles or communications on any topic. This kind of wordsmith is ready to write any manuscript for anyone. But upon inspection, it is found that this staff member does not delve deeply into any matter, does not understand life, does not learn anything, and perfunctorily composes articles with general, empty sentences. Newspaper editorial departments often use such wordsmiths. For example, not long ago, "Stavropol Truth Newspaper" published a log of the summer planting process. For them, it would have been much easier to talk to experts about this issue before writing. But the editorial staff believed that they were quite familiar with agricultural technology issues as well. As a result, everything went wrong. "Socialist Agriculture Newspaper" had to come out to correct the mistakes made by the editorial department of "Stavropol Truth Newspaper."

    Finally, the harm of the practice of writing articles in place of authors also lies in the fact that the newspaper editorial department essentially abandons correspondent activists. Some activists' names are formally published in the newspaper and in the editorial department's reports, but in fact, the editorial department does not have them, and the newspaper is only being run by a small group of in-house staff.

    Isn't it clear that it is time to end this non-Bolshevik practice? Instead of writing things in place of Party, Soviet, and economic workers, as is often the case here, we should teach them and inspire their interest in commissioned communication work. The daily work of the newspaper editorial department with its author activists, worker correspondents, and rural correspondents must be to help them improve their writing.

    It must be constantly remembered what Comrade Stalin said in the editorial of the inaugural issue of "Pravda": "Literary artists do not fall from the sky, they can only be slowly cultivated in writing work. Only by boldly taking up the work and hitting a nail once or twice can one then learn to write." (Complete Works of Stalin, Volume 2, page 249)

    The third method to improve the work with non-editorial activists is to publish letters from laborers in the newspaper. This requirement seems basic and well-known to everyone. But it must be reminded again. The problem is that some editorial departments treat letters with contempt and publish very few of them.

    Because of this, it is necessary to talk about the laboring people's letters group of the newspaper editorial department. In many places, the laboring people's letters group has become an office for transmitting letters and communications to various agencies, as they say, losing the sense of the newspaper. And the primary task of the editorial department's laboring people's letters group is how to publish more letters in the newspaper. The erroneous practices of some laboring people's letters groups and editorial departments have caused the newspaper to lose many meaningful and useful methods of handling the work of laboring people's letters, helping to expand connections with activists and readers.

    In editorial departments that show enthusiasm and attention to laboring people's letters, many interesting ways of handling letters have been adopted. In addition to publishing letters, the editorial department also compiles commentaries, sketches, cartoons, and other columns with titles such as "Practical Problems," "Selected Editorial Letters," and "Reactions to Unpublished Letters" based on the letters.

    For example, the editorial department of "Volga Commune Newspaper" systematically informs authors through its newspaper of the fate of the suggestions raised in their communications or letters.

    Here is one such report:

    Geologist Svisov of the first level of the Krotovsky oil mine wrote a communication entitled "Sergievsky Oil Area" at the request of the editorial department. This material will be published in "Volga Commune Newspaper" in the next few days.

    Engineer Mavlin of a factory in Kubyshev City sent a letter to the editorial department expressing satisfaction with the newspaper's regular publication of letters from various correspondent stations and answering readers' questions. In the letter, Comrade Mavlin suggested that the newspaper systematically publish communications on the theme of "The Stalin Five-Year Plan Under Construction."

    The newspaper replied to him:

    "The editorial department has considered the suggestions of its readers and will open a column in the newspaper suitable for this topic."

    This kind of correspondence with readers will unconditionally promote the expansion of the editorial department's connection with activists and attract new authors to participate in newspaper work.

    Handling letters—this is not bureaucratic work, but creative and lively work. How many letters should be published and on which page they should be published are all very important. A system must be established so that every issue of provincial, regional, republican, city, and district newspapers publishes letters from laborers, so that the editorial department can use the received communications to decide on issues in various economic and political sectors.

    It is also very important that the editorial department express its opinions on the more acute issues raised in the letters. Otherwise, it is often the case that after a letter clarifying a major issue is published in the newspaper, the editorial department does not express its own views. As a result, the editorial department has only prepared a space in the newspaper for the letter. In this case, the silence of the editorial department reduces the role of the letter. Therefore, in the editor's notes, in editorials, and in summaries of letters, the editorial department needs to support the valuable opinions and criticisms of the laborers.

    The fourth method to expand the connection between the newspaper editorial department and author activists lies in thoroughly improving the work of correspondents, that is, quickly and fundamentally improving the mass organization work of our newspapers.

    Here, it must be remembered that the mass work of the editorial department is the main method to improve the newspaper and expand its themes. Mass work cannot be turned into an independent part separated from writing work and editorial department activities; this work should systematically participate in the process of running the newspaper and must be linked to the various sections of the newspaper. All groups of the editorial department should strive in this direction. The editorial department uses mass policies to (1) maintain constant contact with the masses and readers; (2) widely absorb a large number of correspondents from workers, collective farm members, and intellectuals to participate in newspaper work; (3) cultivate and educate worker-peasant correspondents and author activists.

    In the arsenal of the Bolshevik press, there are many meaningful methods of mass work that have been proven by life and tested in the construction of socialism at all stages and during the Patriotic War.

    Now, let's briefly talk about the basic methods of the editorial department's work with author activists, worker-peasant correspondents.

    Individual work. Individual work is the most important way for the editorial department to contact authors and help them in their communication work. Some of our reporters are not good at correctly doing the work of author activists, leading to serious shortcomings and errors. This is especially useful to explain the phenomenon of newspaper staff replacing Party, Soviet, and economic workers in writing articles. This can also explain the failure to select authors. That is why every editor has a responsibility to educate his colleagues with the correct working methods for correspondents and activists.

    We have the best proof here regarding Lenin's work with authors. Krupskaya mentioned this in her memoirs.

    Krupskaya wrote: "Vladimir Ilyich designated this or that author to write an article on a certain topic. But he did not immediately ask him to write, but first talked with this comrade about the topic and discussed it in detail. The author talked enthusiastically. Vladimir Ilyich inspired according to the topic and clarified it from all aspects. They seemed to be having an ordinary conversation. However, after this, Vladimir Ilyich suddenly asked: "Can you write about this topic?" Then this comrade began to write."

    This is a typical example of individual work with authors. The colleagues of our newspaper editorial department should learn to do their work in this way.

    Sometimes someone asks, how can a certain author write an article or communication that the editor needs within a specified period? What methods should be used to help the author, what is allowed to be done here and what is not allowed? We feel that this question must be answered with the following method. If the editor writes an article in place of the author, this is not allowed. But this does not mean that we should completely refuse to help them. Where should this help be? For example, an editor or editorial department staff member agrees with a Party, economic worker, engineer, or Stakhanov worker to write a designated article in the newspaper. It is necessary to talk to this comrade in detail, to agree on what issues should be clarified in the article, and what materials and facts should be used. The result of this conversation may be to organize an outline for this article. Then the author's independent work begins; he writes the article and submits it to the editorial department. Of course, there may be textual modifications during the editing process. All of this is completely allowed, but it must be agreed upon by the author.

    Correspondence with correspondents. The editorial department of our newspaper also uses correspondence methods to maintain contact with authors. The editorial department answers received communications and short messages, gives authors writing tasks, and mails plans, etc. All of this is a common and main way to contact correspondents. But it is necessary to end the formalism in this work. Communication must be carried out in such a way as to promote the improvement and learning of correspondents and help the editorial department obtain more sources of newspaper materials.

    Many newspaper editorial departments prepare memos for worker correspondents and rural correspondents on time. This method of contacting correspondents is of great significance.

    In the memo, the editorial department informs the correspondents of the recent plans, instructs them on the themes needed by the newspaper, and inspires them on how to better study the themes, etc. The editorial department must carefully prepare this "memo" and classify it according to the different scopes of the authors.

    Meetings of author activists. Recently, newspaper editorial departments have begun to regularly convene meetings of author activists, worker correspondents, and rural correspondents.

    These meetings are often convened by the editorial department's groups or by the editor. Meetings convened by the groups discuss specific issues that the groups want to raise in the newspaper. Meetings convened by the editor are often activists' meetings on the general work plan of the newspaper. In these meetings, the editorial department always receives valuable and reasonable suggestions and criticisms from its activists.

    The experience of the Rostov "Hammer Newspaper" editorial department in convening activists' meetings is noteworthy. For example, the Party life group convened the following meetings: propagandists, Party group leaders, district committee instructors, and collective farm Party organization secretaries. Staff members of the industrial group convened meetings of Stakhanov workers, economic workers, various economic budgets, industrial technical schools, the application of new technologies, etc.

    In addition, the editorial department's groups also held monthly meetings of author activists, at which they discussed the group's work summary for the month and the work plan for the next month. Regular participants in the group meetings: agricultural economic group—the province's main agricultural technicians, experts in various agricultural economic sectors, chairmen of collective farm business meetings, and some tractor station directors and collective farm chairmen; industrial group—train factory engineers, architects, transportation engineers, Stakhanov workers, economic experts, and wall newspaper editors. At the meetings convened by the propaganda group and the cultural and life group, more than thirty scientific workers, teachers, actors, and writers from Rostov participated.

    In May 1948, the editorial department convened a Rostov city Party-Soviet activist meeting. The participants in the meeting listened to and discussed the editorial department's report on the work of "Hammer Newspaper." They made many valuable suggestions and opinions. In particular, it was mentioned that "Hammer Newspaper" should strengthen its attention to ideological work issues and widely disseminate the experience of advanced workers in factories and collective farms. It was pointed out that the newspaper should regularly publish propaganda articles and lectures, materials on the achievements of the motherland's science, culture, and art, and widely publish reports on local life.

    In the winter of 1947-1948, many newspaper editorial departments held provincial congresses of worker-peasant correspondents. The congress convened by the Provincial Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the editorial department of "Soviet Siberia Newspaper" in Novosibirsk was held very well.

    Two hundred and fifteen people participated in the meeting. Among them were representatives from the newspapers of Tyumen Province, Omsk Province, Tomsk Province, Krasnoyarsk, and Altai Frontier.

    All the speeches of the participants in the meeting particularly emphasized the following idea: Newspaper editorial departments should have truly and seriously engaged in the work of worker-peasant correspondents and lower-level newspapers long ago.

    The participants in the meeting adopted a resolution on organizing a competition for newspaper workers and worker-peasant correspondents in the frontier and western provinces of Siberia to better clarify issues in agricultural economics in the newspaper.

    The staff of the "Soviet Siberia Newspaper" editorial department carefully discussed the summary of the worker-peasant correspondents' meeting, especially discussing the critical opinions made on the newspaper, and formulated concrete methods to fundamentally improve the editorial department's mass work for worker-peasant correspondents and activists.

    Before convening this or that meeting of non-editorial authors, it is necessary to accurately and clearly determine its purpose: what the editorial department wants to get from the meeting and what it wants to teach its authors at the meeting. Only under the condition of careful preparation can the success of any mass policy of the newspaper be estimated.

    Author activist study classes. Unfortunately, this way of working is still very weakly developed. The significance of study classes for non-editorial activists is very important. These study classes consolidate the connection between the editorial department and worker-peasant correspondents, help newspaper activists improve their political level, and instill them with the necessary communication work skills.

    Worker-peasant correspondent activist study classes can be organized by the editorial department, as well as by large enterprises and various districts. If the study class is organized in various districts or in factories, then it must be jointly organized with the district newspaper or factory newspaper editorial department.

    The curriculum of such study classes is usually ten to twelve lessons. The curriculum can roughly include this type of question: the current tasks of the newspaper (two to three times of learning about the work of various departments of the newspaper); the written form and types of newspaper materials (articles, communications, news commentaries, sketches, etc.); the creative work of correspondents; wall newspaper editorial department work, etc.

    Some editorial departments hold regular tutoring for worker-peasant correspondent activists. For example, in the "Soviet Lithuanian Newspaper" (Vilnius City), there is such a notice.

    "Worker Correspondent Tutoring"

    Today from 6:00 to 8:00 pm, individual tutoring for worker correspondents and non-editorial author activists will be held in the office of worker-peasant correspondents at the editorial department of "Soviet Lithuanian Newspaper" (No. 3 Commune Street).

    This method of the newspaper is worthy of approval and encouragement.

    Worker-peasant correspondent stations. Worker correspondent and rural correspondent stations have become the business of our newspaper work. The materials of the correspondent station published in the newspaper are, as a theorem, always meaningful, rich in content, and effective. Readers accept these materials with the most satisfactory attitude.

    Recently, many provincial newspapers have used worker correspondent and rural correspondent stations to check the spring plowing preparations of collective farms, tractor stations, and Soviet farms, the economic systems of various enterprises, trade organizations, shops, restaurants, cultural and educational institutions, and other departments.

    The editorial departments of "Ural Worker Newspaper" (Sverdlovsk) and "Red Northern Newspaper" (Vologda) have well organized the correspondent station for checking trade organization work.

    The Tuli "Commune Newspaper" worker correspondents checked the situation of daily necessities production.

    The editorial department of "Volga Commune Newspaper" (Kubyshev) used the correspondent station to check the work of the provincial central Soviet organs. How do they receive visitors? How do the comrades of the organs treat visitors who come on official or private business? The editorial department raised such questions to worker-peasant correspondents—participants in the correspondent station.

    Worker correspondents found a lack of basic culture in the work of some organs, and a bureaucratic and polite attitude towards people. As a result, a special column composed of sharp communications from authors was published in the newspaper: "Visitors come to the organs…". These materials caused a great social reaction and played a correct role. Not long after, in the column entitled "Reaction of this newspaper," some leaders of the organs who had been sharply criticized by the correspondent station published statements about what methods they were taking to eliminate the pointed out shortcomings.

    The newspaper systematically published communications from the Kubyshev factory correspondent station under the column entitled "Worker correspondents, fighting for savings and against waste!".

    The correspondent station—is a valuable and effective way of collective work for newspaper worker-peasant correspondents and author activists. In addition to author activists, the correspondent station also often attracts some new people with communication work experience, who are learning to study the collected materials and draw the proper conclusions. In this way, the editorial department uses the correspondent station to expand and educate its activists, and the newspaper obtains their rich and meaningful materials.

    The success of the correspondent station first depends on the accuracy of the editorial department's arrangement of the correspondent station. This arrangement must include the following basic methods: selecting the correspondent station and its leaders; detailed instructions for the participants of the correspondent station; specific tasks for each station; publishing plans in the newspaper sufficient to illustrate the achievements of the correspondent station; attracting district newspapers and factory newspapers to participate in the correspondent station. After establishing the correspondent station, the editorial department must tenaciously strive for the effectiveness of the materials provided by the worker-peasant correspondent station.

    There can be many ways to absorb laborers to actively participate in newspaper work in the editorial department's arrangements. Such as Stakhanov worker experience forums, various writing conferences and delegate meetings, correspondence, public inspections, etc. Practice indicates that the wide application of this mass policy expands the editorial department's sources of materials, enlivens the newspaper's pages, and brings good results.

    Some editorial departments convened creative social gatherings of reporters and author activists. For example, the editorial department of "Socialist Donbass Newspaper" organized such a social gathering. The editorial department invited Stakhanov workers and instructors from the two largest shock construction competition participants in the country—the "Azov Construction Project" and the "Zaporozhye Construction Project"—as guests. At this friendship social gathering, engineers and Stakhanov workers of the "Zaporozhye Construction Project" recounted how builders and installers achieved brilliant achievements in fulfilling the government's tasks and guaranteed Stakhanov-style speed and the highest quality of construction installation work.

    This social gathering enabled the editorial department to prepare and publish in the newspaper a column of interesting materials selected from the speeches of the participants in the social gathering. This column is called "The Lessons of the 'Zaporozhye Construction Project'." This material is educational both for the readers of "Socialist Donbass Newspaper" and for the colleagues of the editorial department.

    The editorial department of "Ukrainian Truth Newspaper" held a social gathering with librarians and catalogers from Kiev City Library. At this social gathering, speakers made many valuable suggestions to the newspaper's book review group. A wide exchange of views was made on the introduction of books in the city library.

    The participants in the social gathering enthusiastically expressed their willingness to actively help the work of the newspaper editorial department's book review group.

    Recently, various interesting ways of mass work have been found again in some newspapers.

    In terms of promoting the experience of advanced agricultural economics, it is worth pointing out the collective farm correspondence university of "Volga Commune Newspaper," the advanced experience school of "Krasnoyarsk Worker Newspaper," and the advanced experience forums of "Communist Party Member Newspaper" (Saratov) and "Red Kurgan Newspaper."

    Following the example of "Labor Newspaper," Stakhanov worker gatherings have been widely disseminated. Now, Ivanovo "Worker Frontier Newspaper," Vladimir "Call Newspaper," and many other newspapers are holding this type of evening party. Khabarovsk "Pacific Star Newspaper" has opened a "Club of Engineers and Technicians" column.

    "Kirov Truth Newspaper" has opened a "Party Worker Forum" column, and many newspapers have conducted writing conferences of collective farm Party organization secretaries.

    "Dnieper Truth Newspaper" (Dnepropetrovsk) conducted a public inspection of the internal reserve forces of the factory. Due to this event, more than thirty engineers, technicians, and enterprise leaders published articles in the newspaper.

    Some editorial departments have also adopted interesting methods such as "registration forms." Recently, "Kursk Truth Newspaper" sent registration forms to collective rural chairmen, three-person group leaders, and other collective farm workers. These registration forms were sent to three thousand five hundred people. "Socialist Karaganda Newspaper" asked one hundred engineers and technicians the following questions: "What are you studying in order to complete the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule, and what rationalization suggestions are you implementing?" Almost all the recipients answered the questions of the editorial department.

    The editorial department of "Pacific Star Newspaper" (Khabarovsk) used radio to ask many captains who were sailing to tell about the working day of sailors. The captains responded to the editorial department's request. Their answers were published as a striking column entitled "The Laboring People at Sea."

    Speaking of mass work, it is necessary to particularly point out the necessity of constant contact between newspaper editorial departments and their readers. Needless to say, the editorial department's separation from readers adversely affects the entire work of the newspaper. The editor and all staff members of the editorial department must know what the reader asks the newspaper today, how the materials published by the newspaper are reacting, and what suggestions are being made from the outside. We must always be concerned about how to better meet the requirements of readers, so that every word of the newspaper—the words of the Bolshevik newspaper—reaches every laborer, inspires his thinking, and raises his productive and socio-political enthusiasm.

    Lenin gave a high value to readers' reactions, criticisms, and suggestions. In the statement on the publication of "Worker Newspaper" in 1910, he wrote:

    "We rely on the help of local organizations and individual worker groups, because only their active work with the newspaper, only their support, their reactions, their articles, materials, reports and opinions can make the newspaper stand up and ensure that "Worker Newspaper" is published." (Collection of "Bolshevik Press," page 127, 1940 edition)

    It is necessary to constantly convene meetings of readers and discuss with them. Here, what we need is not grand meetings, but conversations with readers about the work of the newspaper. Let the reader say what he likes and dislikes in the newspaper, what he thinks is good and what is bad. The reader is the sharpest critic and the best assistant of the newspaper work.

    Our press cannot develop and perfect itself without criticism. In this way, newspaper workers should constantly ask readers what they think of the newspaper, and pay attention to listening to the readers' critical opinions and their suggestions.

    Such are the basic tasks of the mass work of the newspaper editorial department, and such are the ways to improve the work of author activists.

　　报纸编辑部的群众工作
    葛烈勃涅夫
    四
    必须采用什么样的方法才能从根本上改进报纸编辑部对作者积极分子、工人通讯员与农村通讯员的工作呢？
    首先应当把编辑部的机构转向对作者的日常有效的工作方面来。应当注意一九四○年七月二十五日联共（布）党中央委员会《关于省、边疆及共和国报纸的编制》的有名的决议，联共（布）党中央委员会的决议规定各报编辑必须“……从根本上改组编辑部机构的工作，把吸收广大的非编辑部积极分子来做报纸工作，培养并教育工人和农村通讯员的新干部作为首要的任务”。（《党关于报刊的决议》汇编，一九三页）
    其次，决议中以如下的方式陈述了报纸特派记者的任务：“认为在报纸周围组织广大的非编辑部作者积极分子，吸收党、苏维埃及经济组织的工作人员、苏维埃知识分子、工人与农村通讯员参加报纸的工作是特派记者的首要任务。”（同上注）
    某些编辑部的工作人员就忘记了这些指示。例如《红色鞑靼报》的十二个特派记者于一九四八年初三个月里一共只寄来作者积极分子的二十四篇通讯与短讯！
    报纸的编辑必须这样组织这个工作，为了使得每一个编辑部的同人都认为——除掉个人的文字工作活动以外——吸收非编辑部作者积极分子，教育并培养工人和农村通讯员是最重要的任务。
    必须明白，吸收作者积极分子参加报纸工作——是我们报纸工作中的基本问题。
    在各地方党组织中要造成这样的风气，就是认为党的积极分子、普通党员的广大的小组必须大家来办报。
    列宁永远视文字工作为一般党的工作的组成部分。他写道：所有的党员都应当参加办报的工作。列宁首先要求党组织、党工作人员在文字上支持并参加布尔塞维克出版机关。
    乌拉基米尔·依里奇坚决反对资产阶级的习惯的想法，文字工作者和记者的工作是在于写，而读者的工作是在于读。他讥笑半奥布洛莫夫（冈察洛夫的小说《奥布洛莫夫》一书的主角），半商人式的原则：“作者写写，读者读读。”列宁写道：“这是一个错误的想法，好像就是新闻记者而且只有新闻记者（意即以此为职业者）才能够顺利地参加机关报纸工作，相反地，机关报只有在那时才会是活泼而有生命力的，即：当供给五个领导的、经常写稿的记者的需要的——是五百个甚至五千个非记者的工作人员的时候。”（列宁全集第四版第七卷第四九○页）
    如果报纸编辑部和积极分子密切联系，如果她经常地发扬工人、集体农庄庄员、知识分子的高尚的发表欲，那么在报纸面前就打开了业务的广阔的前途。相反地，如果报纸编辑部脱离了人民，脱离了通讯员积极分子，报纸便将开始衰败以至灭亡。
    在一九二四年，斯大林同志在祝贺《农民报》时，写道，报纸的第一条守则就是——爱护自己的农村通讯员如同爱护自己的眼珠一样。斯大林同志指示《农民报》说，农村通讯员是报纸的胜利军，报纸的支柱。
    第二个改善和扩大与通讯员积极分子的联系的方法就是迅速结束对作者工作的形式主义的态度。
    这种形式主义表现之一就是由报纸内部同人代替党、苏维埃、经济工作者写论文的作风。这种作风在某些编辑部已经根深蒂固，直接违反布尔塞维克报纸的传统并给我们的报纸带来了很大的害处。这种恶劣的作风的害处在什么地方呢？
    第一，当我们的干部在报纸上放弃了综合经济建设经验、党与国家工作经验的责任的时候，编辑部就作得不对。事实上，我们这里常常是怎样呢？比如，编辑部想刊登某工厂厂长的论文。为了达到这个目的，它派了自己的一个工作人员到那个工厂去。他到了那里，在工厂管理科拿到各种报告记录、材料，根据这些材料写好一篇论文交给工厂厂长签字。这样怎么能谈得到非编辑部作者的特约的、创造的工作呢？但是要知道工厂厂长在报纸上发表论文以前，必须严肃的考虑工厂工作的各种问题，综合确实的事实、现象，给以很好的分析，周密的研究经济工作的经验。只有在这样的情况下，才能写出带来益处的、有教育意义的、内容丰富的论文。
    第二，以记者的写作来代替作者积极分子的特约的、创造的写作的作风，削弱了报纸的内容，降低了它的水准。某些报纸缺乏对业务的应有的知识，却经常地并完全没有考虑地论述经济的、文化的、党工作的问题。
    可惜的是，我们这里还有很多这样的报纸工作者，他们认为一切都无所谓，他们什么都知道，也能够写出任何题目的论文或通讯来。这种文字匠准备为任何人写作任何稿件。但是在检查的时候，发现这种工作人员对哪一件事情也是不深入的，不懂得生活，什么也不学习，以一般的空空洞洞的句子敷衍成文，满不在乎。报纸编辑部常常用上了这种文字匠。例如，不久以前，《斯达夫洛波里真理报》发表了一篇夏季种植进程日志。对他们来说，同专家谈谈这个问题以后再写，不知道要简单多少。但是编辑部同人认为他们对农业技术问题也相当熟悉。结果都弄错了。《社会主义农业报》就不得不出来纠正《斯达夫洛波里真理报》编辑部所犯的错误。
    最后，代替作者写论文的作风的害处还在于，报纸编辑部在实质上抛弃了通讯员积极分子。在报纸上，在编辑部的报告里，形式地登载一些积极分子的姓名，而事实上编辑部是没有他们的，报纸只是由一小群编制以内的工作人员在搞。
    难道这还不清楚么，已经是结束这种非布尔塞维克的作风的时候了。不是代替党、苏维埃、经济工作者来写东西，像我们这里常见的一样，而是教导他们，启发他们对特约通讯工作的兴趣。报纸编辑部对自己的作者积极分子、工人通讯员和农村通讯员的日常工作就是必须帮助他们在写作上的提高。
    必须经常记得斯大林同志在《真理报》创刊号社论中所说的几句要紧的话：“文艺家不是从天上掉下来的，他们只能在文字工作中慢慢培养起来。只有大胆地拿起工作，碰一两次钉子以后，在那时才能学会写作。”（斯大林全集第二卷第二四九页）
    第三个改善对非编辑部积极分子的工作的方法，是在报纸上刊登劳动者的来信。这个要求好像是起码的并且也是大家都知道的。但是必须再提醒一下。问题在于某些编辑部对待来信的态度是鄙视的，很少发表。
    由于这一点，必须谈谈关于报纸编辑部的劳动者来信组。在许多地方劳动者来信组变成了给各机关传递来信与通讯的办事处，如同一般人所说的失掉了报纸的感觉了。而编辑部的劳动者来信组的首要任务是怎样能更多的在报上发表来信。有些劳动者来信组和编辑部的错误的作风，使得报纸失掉了处理劳动者来信工作的许多有意义、有用处的，帮助扩大与积极分子和读者联系的方法。
    在对劳动者来信表现热心的、注意的态度的编辑部，采用了许多处理来信的有意思的工作方式。除了发表信件以外，编辑部还根据来信编写了述评、小品、漫画、以“实际问题”、“编辑部信件选刊”、“未发表的来信的反响”为题的其他专栏。
    例如《伏尔加公社报》编辑部，有系统地通过自己的报纸告诉作者他们的通讯或来信中所提建议的命运。
    这就是这类报道之一：
    克洛托夫斯基开采石油矿的一级地质学家斯威肃夫根据编辑部的要求写了一篇《谢尔吉耶夫斯基石油区》的通讯，这个材料将在最近几天的《伏尔加公社报》发表。
    古比雪夫城某工厂的工程师马夫林寄给编辑部一封信，信上对报纸开始经常发表各通讯员站的来信，答读者问表示满意。信内马夫林同志给读报建议有系统地刊登关于“在建设中的斯大林五年计划”的题材的通讯。
    该报回答说他：
    “编辑部考虑了自己读者的建议，并将在报上开辟适合于这个题目的专栏。”
    与读者间的这种往来信件无条件地将促进编辑部与积极分子的联系的扩大，吸收新的作者来参加报纸工作。
    处理信件的工作——这不是事务主义式的工作，而是创造性的、活泼的工作。应当发表多少来信，应当把他们登载在那一版上，这一切都很重要。必须确定这样一种制度，以便省的、边疆的、共和国的、城市的、区的每一期报纸上都发表劳动者的来信，以便编辑部能利用收到的通讯来决定各经济——政治部门的问题。
    编辑部对信件中所提出来的比较尖锐的问题应该发表自己的意见，这一点也是很重要的。要不然就常是这样，报纸上发表了一篇阐明了一个重大问题的来信以后，而编辑部却不发表自己的观点。结果是，编辑部仅仅替来信在报上准备了地盘而已。在这种情况下，编辑部的沉默就减低了来信的作用。因此，在编者按语中，在社论中，在来信摘要中，编辑部需要支持劳动者的宝贵的意见和批评。
    第四个扩大报纸编辑部与作者积极分子联系的方法在于彻底改善对通讯员的工作，也就是说，迅速地从根本上改善我们报纸的群众组织工作。
    在这里，必须记得，编辑部的群众工作是改善报纸扩大其题材的主要方法。不能变群众工作为某种脱离文字工作和编辑部活动的一个独立的部分；这个工作应该有组织地参加办报的过程，必须和报纸上的各版联系起来。必须对通讯员的全部工作，编辑部的全部群众政策都从报纸在一定时期的具体计划出发，使得它们都能促进改善报纸内容，提高其思想政治和文化水平。编辑部的各组都应该在这方面努力。编辑部运用群众政策（１）保持与群众、与读者的经常的联系；（２）广泛的从工人、集体农庄庄员、知识分子中吸收大量的通讯员来参加报纸工作；（３）培养、教育工农通讯员作者积极分子。
    在布尔塞维克报刊的兵工厂中有着不少的有意义的、为生活所证实了的、在社会主义各阶段建设中和卫国战争时期中受过考验的群众工作的方式。
    现在简单地谈谈编辑部对作者积极分子、对工农通讯员的工作的基本方式。
    个别的工作。个别工作是编辑部与作者联系和在通讯工作中帮助他们的最主要的方式。我们某些记者不善于正确地做作者积极分子的工作，引向了严重的缺点和错误。这特别可用以解释报纸工作人员代替党、苏维埃和经济工作者写论文的现象。这也可以解释选择作者的失败。这就是为什么每一个编辑都有责任以对通讯员积极分子的正确的工作方法教育自己的同人。
    在我们这里有关于列宁对作者工作的最好的证明。克鲁普斯卡亚在她的回忆录中谈到了这一点。
    克鲁普斯卡亚写道：“乌拉基米尔·依里奇指定这位或者那位作者要写一篇什么论文。但是他并不立刻提出要他写，却首先与这位同志谈这个题目，并且详细地讨论它。作者热心地谈着。乌拉基米尔·依里奇按照题目进行启发，从各方面来阐明它。他们好像在进行着普通的谈话。然而在这以后，乌拉基米尔·依里奇突然问问道：“你能不能把这题目写一写呢？”于是这位同志就开始写了。”
    这就是对作者个别工作的典型的例子。我们报纸编辑部的同人应该这样学习做自己的工作。
    有时候有人问，怎样才能使得某一位作者写出一篇编辑在指定时期内所需要的论文和通讯呢？应该用什么方法来帮助作者，在这里什么是允许作的和什么是作不得的？我们觉得必须用以下的方法来回答这个问题。如果编辑工作者代替作者写论文，这是作不得的。但是这不等于说，我们就应该完全拒绝对他们的帮助。这种帮助应该在那里呢？例如，某一位编辑或编辑部工作人员与党、经济工作者、工程师、斯达哈诺夫工作者说好在报纸上写一篇指定的文章。必须与这位同志详细地谈，说好在论文中应该阐明那些问题，利用那些材料、事实。这样谈话的结果可能就组织好了这篇论文的提纲。然后作者的独立工作就开始了；他写论文并且向编辑部交了卷。当然，在编审过程中可以有文字上的修改。这一切都完全允许的，但一定要得到作者同意。
    和通讯员们的通信。我们报纸的编辑部同样的用通信方法与作者们保持联系。编辑部回答收到的通讯和短讯，给作者以写作的任务，邮寄计划等。这一切都是与通讯员联系的通常的和主要的方法。但必须结束这个工作中的形式主义。必须这样进行通信，以便促进通讯员的提高、学习，帮助编辑部获得报纸材料的更多的来源。
    许多报纸编辑部按时地为工人通讯员与农村通讯员做备忘录。这个与通讯员联系的方法是有着重大意义的。
    在备忘录中编辑部把最近的计划通知通讯员，指示他们报纸所需要的题材，启发他们怎样能将题材研究得更好等等。编辑部必须细心地编制这种“备忘录”，按照作者的不同的范围进行分类。
    作者积极分子会议。近来报纸编辑部开始经常地召开作者积极分子、工人通讯员和农村通讯员的会议。
    这种会议经常是由编辑部各组或编辑召开的。由各组召开的会议讨论各组想在报纸上提出的具体问题。由编辑召开的经常是关于报纸一般工作计划的积极分子会议。在这种会议上，编辑部总是得到自己的积极分子的一些宝贵的、合理的建议和批评。
    罗斯托夫《铁锤报》编辑部召开积极分子会议的经验是值得注意的。例如，党的生活组召开了如下的会议：宣传员的，党小组组长的，区党委指导员的，集体农庄党组织书记的。工业组工作人员召开了斯达哈诺夫工作者的，经济工作者的，各种经济预算的，工业技术学校的，运用新技术的等等会议。
    除此以外，编辑部各组还举行作者积极分子的每月会议，在这个会议上讨论各组一个月的工作总结和下月工作计划。各组会议的经常的参加者：农业经济组——该省主要农业技师，农业经济各部门的专家，集体农庄业务会议主席，某些拖拉机站站长和集体农庄主席；工业组——火车工厂工程师，建筑师，运输工程师，斯达哈诺夫工作者，经济专家，墙报编辑。在宣传组、文化与生活组所召开的会议上，参加者有三十多个罗斯托夫的科学工作者，教员，演员，作家。
    一九四八年五月间编辑部召开了罗斯托夫城党——苏维埃积极分子会议。会议参加者听取并讨论了编辑部关于《铁锤报》工作的报告。他们提出了许多宝贵的建议和意见。特别是谈到《铁锤报》应该加强对思想工作问题的注意，广泛地传播工厂和集体农庄的先进者的经验。指出该报应当经常地登载宣传论文，讲演报告，关于祖国科学、文化、艺术成就上的材料，广泛的登载关于地方生活的报道。
    在一九四七——一九四八年冬季有许多报纸的编辑部举行了全省工农通讯员会议。联共（布）党省委会和《苏维埃西伯利亚报》编辑部在新西伯利亚所召开的这种会议举行得很好。
    参加会议的有二百一十五人。其中有秋明省，鄂木斯克省，托姆斯克省，克拉斯诺雅尔斯克和阿尔泰边疆各报的代表。
    参加会议者的全部发言都特别着重下列思想：报纸编辑部早就应当真正地、严肃地从事工农通讯员的和下级报刊的工作。
    会议的参加者通过了关于组织报刊工作者和边疆及西伯利亚省西部的工农通讯员在报纸上更好地阐明农业经济方面问题的竞赛的决议。
    《苏维埃西伯利亚报》编辑部工作人员详细地讨论了工农通讯员会议上的总结，特别讨论了对报纸所作的批评性的意见，并拟定了根本改善编辑部对工农通讯员和对积极分子的所有群众工作的具体办法。
    在召开这个或那个非编辑部作者会议以前，必须精确地并明显地确定其目的：编辑部从会议上想得到什么和它在会议上想教授自己的作者一些什么。只有在周密准备的条件之下才能够估计到报纸的任何群众政策的成绩。
    作者积极分子研究班。可惜的是，这种工作方式到现在还是开展得很弱。研究班对非编辑部积极分子的意义是非常重大的。这些研究班巩固编辑部与工农通讯员之间的联系，帮助报纸积极分子提高政治水平，以必须的通讯工作的技巧灌输给他们。
    工农通讯员积极分子研究班可以由编辑部，及大企业和各区举办。如果研究班是在各区或在工厂里组织的，那么它必须与区报纸或工厂报纸编辑部共同举办。
    这种研究班的课程普通是十——十二课。课程大致可以包括这一类的问题：报纸当前任务（二——三次关于报纸各部门工作的学习）；报纸材料的文字形式和种类（论文、通讯、新闻评论、小品文及其他）；通讯员的创造性的工作；墙报编辑部工作及其他。
    某些编辑部为工农通讯员积极分子举行了经常的学习辅导。例如，在《苏维埃立陶宛报》（维里纽斯城）上就有着这样一类启事。
    “工人通讯员的学习辅导”
    本日午后六——八点在《苏维埃立陶宛报》编辑部（公社街三号楼下）工农通讯员办公室举行工人通讯员和非编辑部作者积极分子的个别辅导。
    该报这种方法是值得赞同和鼓励的。
    工农通讯员站。工人通讯员和农村通讯员站已成为我们报纸工作的业务了。在报上所发表的通讯员站的材料，如同定理一样，永远是有意义的、内容丰富的和起作用的。读者以最满意的心情来接受这些材料。
    近来有许多省报通过工人通讯员和农村通讯员站来检查集体农庄、拖拉机站和苏维埃农场的春耕准备，各企业的经济制度，贸易组织，商店，餐厅，文化教育机关及其他部门的工作。
    《乌拉尔工人报》（斯维尔得洛夫）和《红色北方报》（伏洛格塔）编辑部很好地组织了检查贸易组织工作的通讯员站。
    土里《公社报》工人通讯员检查了日用必需品生产的状况。
    《伏尔加公社报》（古比雪夫）编辑部通过通讯员站来检查了省中心苏维埃机关的工作。他们怎样接待访问者？机关同人怎样对待因公事或私事而来的访问者？编辑部给工农通讯员——通讯员站的参加者提出了这样的问题。
    工人通讯员在某些机关里发现了在工作中基本文化的缺乏，对人的官僚主义的、客客气气的态度。结果在报纸上登载了从作者中来的尖锐的通讯所编成的专栏：“访问者到机关来……”。这些材料都引起了很大的社会反应并起了正确的作用。不久以后在以“本报反响”为题的专栏里发表了一些受过通讯员站尖锐批评的机关领导者关于他们正采取什么方法消灭所指出的缺点的声明。
    该报在以“工人通讯员，为了节约、反对浪费而战！”为题的专栏下有系统地发表了来自古比雪夫各工厂通讯员站的通讯。
    通讯员站——是报纸工农通讯员和作者积极分子的集体工作的宝贵而有效的方式。除了作者积极分子以外，通讯员站还经常吸收一些具有通讯工作经验的新人员，他们在学习着研究所收集的材料，做出应有的结论来。这样，编辑部就利用通讯员站扩大并教育了自己的积极分子，使报纸得到了他们的内容丰富而有意义的材料。
    通讯员站的成绩如何首先要看编辑部布置通讯员站的精确性如何。这种布置必须包括下列基本方法：选拔通讯员站及其领导者；对通讯员站参加者的详细的指示；各站的具体任务；在报纸上发表足以说明通讯员站成绩的计划；吸收区报纸与工厂报纸来参加通讯员站。建立了通讯员站以后，编辑部必须顽强地争取工农通讯员站所提供的材料的有效性。

    在编辑部的布置中可以有许多吸收劳动者积极参加报纸工作的方式。如斯达哈诺夫工作者经验论坛，各种写信会议和代表会议，通信，公众检查等。实践指明，广泛地运用这种群众政策扩大了编辑部获得材料的来源，活跃了报纸的篇幅并带来了良好的效果。
    有些编辑部召开了记者和作者积极分子的创造性的联欢晚会。例如，《社会主义顿巴斯报》编辑部就组织过这种晚会。编辑部邀请了国内两个最大的突击建设竞赛的参加者——“亚速夫建设工程”和“扎波罗什建设工程”的斯达哈诺夫工作者和指导者作为客人。在这个友谊的联欢会上，“扎波罗什建设工程”的工程师和斯达哈诺夫工作者叙述了建筑家和装置家在执行政府的任务中如何达到了光辉的成绩，并保证了斯达哈诺夫式的速度和建设装置工作的最高质量。
    这个联欢会使编辑部准备了并且在报纸上登了一栏从联欢会参加者的发言中所选出来的有意思的材料。这一栏叫作“‘扎波罗什建设工程’的经验教训”。这个材料无论对《社会主义顿巴斯报》的读者或对编辑部同人都是有教育意义的。
    《乌克兰真理报》编辑部与基辅市图书馆馆员和目录家举行了一次联欢晚会。在这个联欢会上，发言者对该报书刊评介组发表了许多宝贵的意见。广泛地交换了关于市图书馆图书介绍的意见。
    联欢会的参加者热烈地表示愿意积极帮助该报编辑部书刊评介组的工作。
    最近在某些报纸上又发现了种种有意思的工作的群众方式。
    在农业经济先进者的经验的宣传方面，值得指出的是《伏尔加公社报》的集体农庄函授大学，《克拉斯诺雅尔斯克工人报》的先进经验学校，《共产党员报》（萨拉托夫）和《红色库尔干报》的先进经验论坛。
    仿照《劳动报》的办法，斯达哈诺夫工作者的集会得到了广泛的传播。现在伊凡诺夫《工人边疆报》，乌拉基米尔《号召报》和其他许多报纸都举行了这一类的晚会。哈巴洛夫斯克《太平洋星报》辟了“工程师和技术人员俱乐部”专栏。
    《基洛夫真理报》辟了“党工作者论坛”专栏，许多报纸进行了集体农庄党组织书记的写信会议。
    《第聂伯真理报》（第聂伯彼得洛夫斯克）举行了工厂内部后备力量的公共检查。由于这一事件，有三十多个工程师、技术人员、企业领导者在报纸上发表了论文。
    有些编辑部也采用了类如“登记表”这种有趣的方式。近来《库尔斯克真理报》把登记表寄给了集体农村主席，三人小组组长和其他集体农庄的工作者。这种登记表寄给了三千五百个人。《社会主义卡拉干达报》向一百个工程师和技术人员提出了这样的问题：“你们在研究些什么以便提前完成五年计划，在贯彻着那些合理化的建议”？差不多所有的收信者都回答了编辑部的问题。
    《太平洋星报》（哈巴洛夫斯克）编辑部用广播要求正在航行的许多船长们讲述海员们的工作日。船长们响应了编辑部的要求。他们的回答发表为以“海上劳动人民”为题的夺目的专栏。

    谈到群众工作，必须特别指出报纸编辑部与自己的读者的经常联系的必要性。不待说，编辑部与读者的脱离有害地影响着报纸的全部工作。编辑和编辑部的全体工作人员必须知道，今天读者向报纸要求知道报纸所发表的材料反应如何，外间建议些什么。我们必须经常关心怎样才能更好的满足读者的要求，使得报纸的每一句话——布尔塞维克报纸的话——达到每一个劳动者，启发他的思想，提高他的生产的和社会政治的积极性。
    列宁给读者的反响、批评、建议以很高的估价。在一九一○年关于《工人报》出版的声明中，他写道：
    “我们依靠地方组织和各个工人小组的帮助，因为只有他们对报纸的积极的工作，只有他们的支持，他们的反响，他们的论文、材料、报告和意见才能够使报纸站得住，并保证《工人报》出下去”。（《布尔塞维克报刊》文集第一二七页，一九四○年版）
    必须经常召集读者开会，和他们商量。在这里，我们需要的不是堂皇的会议，而是与读者的关于报纸工作的谈话。让读者说出他喜欢报纸上的什么和不喜欢什么，他认为什么是好的，什么是坏的。读者—是报纸工作的最尖锐的批评者和最好的助手。
    我们的报刊没有批评，就不能够发展并完备起来。这样，报纸工作者就应当经常向读者问他对报纸作何看法，注意倾听读者的批评性的意见和他们的建议。
    报纸编辑部的群众工作的基本任务就是如此，改善对作者积极分子工作的方法就是如此。
