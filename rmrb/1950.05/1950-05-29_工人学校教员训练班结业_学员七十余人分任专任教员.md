　　Worker School Teacher Training Class Graduates
    Over Seventy Students Assigned as Full-Time Teachers
    [Our Newspaper] The "Worker School Teacher Training Class," jointly organized by the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions and the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, held its graduation ceremony at the Labor People's Cultural Palace at 2:00 PM on the 24th. The class had a total of seventy-eight students, who will be dispatched in batches to various district worker schools to undertake full-time teacher work in the coming days.
    The training class began on the 8th of this month. After fourteen days of study, the students generally made considerable progress in their thinking. Originally, some students came to study in order to solve their employment and livelihood problems, viewing the role of worker teacher as merely a temporary occupation before finding a suitable career. However, after half a month of learning, they have now begun to recognize the importance of worker education and have expressed their willingness to regard this work as a lifelong career.

　　工人学校教员训练班结业
    学员七十余人分任专任教员
    【本报讯】北京市总工会和市文教局合办的“工人学校教员训练班”于二十四日下午二时在劳动人民文化宫举行毕业典礼。该班学员共七十八人，日内即将分批派到各区工人学校担负专任教员工作。
    该训练班于本月八日开学，学员们经过了十四天的学习，一般的在思想上都有了相当的进步。原来为了解决职业问题和生活问题而来学习的同学，他们认为做工人教员不过是在找到合适的职业之前的暂时的职业罢了。但经过了半个月的学习之后，现在也开始认识到工人教育的重要，纷纷表示愿把这件工作当作终身事业。
