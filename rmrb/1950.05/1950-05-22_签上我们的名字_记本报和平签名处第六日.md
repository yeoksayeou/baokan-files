　　Sign Our Names
    Record of the Sixth Day at This Newspaper's Peace Signature Desk
    After signing the Peace Declaration, workers Zhou Rui and a dozen others wrote: "We are uncultured laborers with little education, unable to write eloquent phrases. We only sign our names to show that we support world peace."
    Farmer Yang Jingchen led his wife and children to sign, writing: "If you tens of millions unite your strength, you will surely defend peace. Add our five family members!"
    Eleven comrades from the Shanxi Province Veterans' School sent their signed sheets from Fengtai, writing: "We are disabled veterans from the Shanxi Veterans' School who came to the artificial limb factory in Fengtai Veterans' Administration Office to fit our legs. Upon hearing the news of the peace signature campaign, we immediately wanted to sign, but due to our disabilities, we have difficulty moving around. Today, after seeing the notice in the newspaper, we are writing to send our signatures."
    People's Liberation Army Mongolian soldier Deligeer Beibu signed at the Zhongshan Park signature desk and wrote: "Our Mongolian people were oppressed in the past, but today the Communist Party has liberated us, granting us a democratic and free life. We will forever oppose wars of aggression!" In addition, three Tibetan compatriots signed their names in Tibetan.
    Traditional Chinese medicine doctor Li Jiecun sent three pages of signed sheets, saying: "I am sixty-three years old and can say I have suffered sixty-three years of imperialist oppression and war. I want to live peacefully. I am using my crutches to mobilize my neighbors to sign."
    Zhang Shunsheng, a second-year student in a literacy class at Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School, wrote on the signature sheet: "I am writing a few words, please all peace-loving children around the world quickly participate in the peace signature campaign! Dad says sign, Mom welcomes it; advise children, protect great peace. Unite together, strengthen the peace camp; we must strive to eliminate reactionary bugs."
