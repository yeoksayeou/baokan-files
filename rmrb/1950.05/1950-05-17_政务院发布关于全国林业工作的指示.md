Xinhua News Agency, 16th:

　　The Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government issued a directive on national forestry work. The full text is as follows:

            I. Current Guidelines and Tasks
    The existing forest area in our country accounts for approximately five percent of the territory, and timber production is far from sufficient, leaving us unable to safeguard against natural disasters. Moreover, the destruction and indiscriminate logging of forests have not ceased in most areas. The current guiding principle for our forestry work should be primarily universal forest protection, strictly prohibiting all acts that damage forests. Secondly, in areas severely affected by wind, sand, water, and drought disasters, as long as there is a mass base and sufficient seedlings are available, we should select key areas, mobilize the masses, and, considering various soil and climate conditions, carry out afforestation in a planned manner. We should also collect seeds and cultivate seedlings in large quantities in preparation for afforestation in the coming year. At the same time, to develop transportation, we need railroad ties and utility poles, and to restore construction, we need a large amount of timber. We should formulate reasonable logging plans for each forest area and promote a social movement to conserve timber. To facilitate the compilation of afforestation and logging plans, we should conduct key surveys of suitable barren hills and wastelands and natural forests with better transportation conditions. We must also train cadres in a timely manner and open short-term training classes to solve the shortage of technical personnel. These are the current guidelines and tasks of forestry work.
            II. 1950 Work Plan
    In order to realize and implement the above-mentioned guidelines and tasks, based on specific circumstances, the specific work plan for the whole country this year is stipulated as follows:
    (1) Strengthen forest protection work: In addition to the Central People's Government issuing forest protection instructions and clarifying the reward and punishment system, people's governments at all levels should lead and educate the masses, enabling them to formulate their own forest protection regulations to truly achieve the basic requirements of forest protection. People's representative conferences in and near forest areas should pay attention to discussing and inspecting forest protection work. We must fundamentally stop forest destruction behavior this year.
    (2) Close hillsides for afforestation on 43,120,000 mu (including 43,000,000 mu in the Northwest region and 120,000 mu in the Northeast).
    (3) Collect a total of 3,624,825 jin of various tree seeds for wasteland sowing and nursery seedling cultivation (1,295,145 jin in North China, 97,000 jin in the Northwest, 317,680 jin in Central South, and 1,915,000 jin in East China).
    (4) Cultivate a total of 492,230,000 seedlings of various types (41,250,000 in North China, 7,130,000 in the Northwest, 85,490,000 in Central South, 159,150,000 in East China, and 199,210,000 in the Northeast, including Inner Mongolia).
    (5) Afforestation, including tree planting, seed sowing, and cutting planting, totaling 1,771,842 mu (1,083,042 mu in North China, 72,138 mu in the Northwest, 69,672 mu in Central South, 272,400 mu in East China, and 274,590 mu in the Northeast, including Inner Mongolia).
    (6) Log 4,057,382 cubic meters of timber (3,870,000 cubic meters in the Northeast, including Inner Mongolia, 53,500 cubic meters in the Tao River basin in the Northwest, 56,000 cubic meters in the Southwest, and 77,882 cubic meters in North China).
    (7) Increase and repair 287 kilometers of forest railway (Northeast).
    (8) Cadre Training:
    1. The Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation will train 600 investigation and surveying cadres from existing surplus personnel, and the Northeast will train 500, to form investigation teams for key investigations.
    2. Various localities may, according to work needs, hold short-term training courses for in-service cadres, and pay attention to cultivating and promoting technical workers in various forest farms and nurseries, using the apprentice system to improve their political, cultural, and professional skills. They can also use rotational training methods during the slack farming season to absorb a group of labor heroes, model workers, and activists in forest protection and afforestation to participate in training.
            III. Several Specific Issues Regarding Nursery Land, Logging, and Forest Protection
    For the convenience of work in various regions, the following specific issues are handled as follows:
    (1) In areas where land reform has not yet been carried out, during land reform, in addition to retaining state-owned farms in accordance with land reform regulations, each county should retain a certain amount of land to prepare for operating nurseries. The retained nursery land shall be uniformly managed by the county people's governments and handed over to farmers for cultivation before the formal establishment of nurseries and seedling cultivation, and shall not be abandoned.
    (2) Public forests (including state-owned forests) should be managed and logged by the Ministry of Forestry and Land Reclamation of the Central People's Government or the forestry agencies at all levels entrusted by the Central Government, to统筹(tǒngchóu) supply timber for public and private use. No other organs, troops, schools, or enterprises shall be allowed to log on their own under any pretext.
    In individual areas where stationed troops cannot purchase fuel for their own use and must collect firewood, they may log in public forests, but they must be approved by the local special commissioner's office or higher-level people's government or forestry authorities, designate areas, make reasonable pruning and thinning, and pay the mountain price.
    (3) Private forests shall not be destroyed by anyone before land reform, and shall be handled in accordance with the land reform regulations during land reform.
            IV. Organizational Structure and Leadership Issues
    (1) In large administrative regions where forestry occupies an important position, a Forestry General Bureau may be established under the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.
    (2) The agricultural departments of the provincial people's governments should be changed to agricultural and forestry departments according to the central government's regulations. When necessary for business, a forestry bureau may be established under the agricultural and forestry department.
    (3) The special commissioner's office and the municipal and county people's governments may change the agricultural section to an agricultural and forestry section as needed for business, and designate one to two people within the agricultural and forestry section to be in charge of forestry work.
    (4) The agricultural assistants of the district offices shall be changed to agricultural and forestry assistants, concurrently managing forestry, and the village (township) government or farmers' association shall set up a forestry committee member (without leaving production) as needed for work, to manage matters related to forestry construction in the village (township).
    (5) State-owned forest enterprise organizations (such as logging companies, forest railways, timber processing, etc.) shall be directly and uniformly managed by the large administrative region or provincial forestry agencies entrusted by the Central People's Government. Local people's governments have the responsibility to supervise and inspect and assist in completing tasks.
    All levels of people's governments and forestry management agencies and all forestry workers must seriously study and earnestly implement the above decisions.

                              Premier of the Government Administration Council, Zhou Enlai
                                        Minister of Forestry and Land Reclamation, Liang Xi

　　政务院发布关于全国林业工作的指示
    【新华社十六日讯】中央人民政府政务院发布关于全国林业工作的指示，全文如下：
            一、当前的方针和任务
    我国现存的森林面积约占领土百分之五，木材产量向感不足，对天然灾害之袭击无法保障。而大部分地区对森林的破坏和滥伐行动，迄未停止。我们当前林业工作的方针，应以普遍护林为主，严格禁止一切破坏森林的行为。其次在风沙水旱灾害严重的地区，只要有群众基础，并备种苗条件，应选择重点，发动群众，斟酌土壤气候各种情形，有计划地进行造林，并大量采种育苗以备来年造林之用。同时，为着发展交通，需要枕木电杆，为着恢复建设，需用大批木材，应制订各森林区的合理的采伐计划，并推节约木材的社会运动。为便于编制造林及采伐计划，应对宜林荒山荒地及交通条件较好的天然林进行重点调查，并须及时培养干部，开办短期训练班，解决技术人员缺乏的困难。这都是目前林业工作的方针和任务。
            二、一九五○年工作计划
    为了实现和贯彻上述的方针及任务，根据具体情况，特将本年度全国具体工作计划规定如下：
    （一）加强护林工作：除中央人民政府颁布护林指示，严明奖惩制度外，各级人民政府应领导并教育群众，使群众自己订立护林规约，以切实达到护林的基本要求。林区及林区附近之人民代表会议要注意讨论检查护林工作。要在今年内将森林破坏行为基本地停止下来。
    （二）封山育林四三、一二○、○○○亩（其中包括西北区四三、○○○、○○○亩，东北一二○、○○○亩）。
    （三）为了荒山播种及苗圃育苗之用，采集各类树木种子总共三、六二四、八二五斤（华北一、二九五、一四五斤，西北九七、○○○斤，中南三一七、六八○斤，华东一、九一五、○○○斤）。
    （四）育成各种苗木总共四九二、二三○、○○○株（华北四一、二五○、○○○株，西北七、一三○、○○○株，中南八五、四九○、○○○株，华东一五九、一五○、○○○株，东北包括内蒙在内一九九、二一○、○○○株）。
    （五）造林，包括植树造林、播种造林、插木造林，共一、七七一、八四二亩（华北一、○八三、○四二亩，西北七二、一三八亩，中南六九、六七二亩，华东二七二、四○○亩，东北包括内蒙在内二七四、五九○亩）。
    （六）采伐木材四、○五七、三八二立方公尺（东北包括内蒙在内三、八七○、○○○立方公尺，西北洮河流域五三、五○○立方公尺，西南五六、○○○立方公尺，华北七七、八八二立方公尺）。
    （七）增修森林铁道二八七公里（东北）。
    （八）干部训练：
    １、林垦部就现有编余人员内，训练调查测量干部六百名，东北训练五百名，以备组成调查队，进行重点调查。
    ２、各地得根据工作需要，举办在职干部之短期训练班，并注意培养与提拔各林场苗圃技术工人，用带徒弟方式，提高其政治、文化和业务技术水平。并可在农闲时用轮训办法，吸收一批在护林造林中的劳动英雄、模范工作者和积极分子参加受训。
            三、关于苗圃地与伐木及护林的几个具体问题
    为了各地区工作便利起见，特将几个具体问题作如下的处理：
    （一）未经土地改革的地区，在土地改革时，除依土地改革的法规保留公营农场外，各县应保留一定数量之土地，准备经营苗圃。保留之苗圃地，在未正式建圃育苗前，暂由各县人民政府统一管理，交农民耕种，不得荒废。
    （二）公有林（包括国有林）应由中央人民政府林垦部或中央委托之各级林业机构经营采伐，统筹供应公私用材，其他任何机关、部队、学校或企业，不得借口任何理由，自行采伐。
    个别地区驻扎部队，如确因自用燃料无法购得必须樵采时，得在公有林采伐，但必须经当地专署以上人民政府或林业主管机关核准，指定区域，作合理的修枝疏伐，并须照缴山价。
    （三）对于私有林，在土地改革前，任何人不得破坏，在土地改革进行期间，照土地改革的法规办理。
            四、关于组织机构与领导问题
    （一）大行政区林业占重要地位者，得于农林部下设立林业总局。
    （二）省人民政府农业厅应按中央规定，改为农林厅。业务上有必要时，得在农林厅下设林业局。
    （三）专署及市县人民政府，视业务之需要，可改农业科为农林科，并在农林科内指定一至二人，专管林业工作。
    （四）区公所农业助理员改为农林助理员，兼管林业，村（乡）政府或农会视工作需要得设林业委员一人（不脱离生产），管理村（乡）中有关林业建设的事项。
    （五）国营森林企业机构（如伐木公司、森林铁道、木材加工等），由中央人民政府委托大行政区或省林业机关直接统一经营管理。地方人民政府有监督检查与协助完成任务之责。
    以上决定，各级人民政府及林业管理机构并全体林业工作人员必须认真研究，切实执行。
