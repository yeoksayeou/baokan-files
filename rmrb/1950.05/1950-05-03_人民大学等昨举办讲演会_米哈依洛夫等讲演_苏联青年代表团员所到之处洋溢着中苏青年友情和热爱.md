Xinhua News Agency, May 2nd: The Soviet Youth Delegation, on its third day in Beijing, May 2nd, continued to attend four symposiums and eight lectures organized by various groups in the capital. The head of the Soviet Youth Delegation, Mikhailov, and three delegates attended a lecture at Renmin University in the morning, which was personally presided over by President Wu Yuzhang. In his speech, Mikhailov cited abundant facts to illustrate the brilliant achievements of Soviet culture under the leadership of the great Stalin. In the afternoon, Mikhailov also attended the Beijing Municipal Industrial Workers Congress held at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Factory. He introduced the happy life of Soviet workers to the Chinese worker brothers and pointed out that this was the result of Soviet workers' infinite loyalty to the motherland, improving technology, saving raw materials, and actively engaging in production. After the lecture, Mikhailov visited the Shijingshan Factory and inquired in detail about the workers' living conditions. The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Factory's trade union presented the Soviet delegation with a labor model medal, and the iron smelting plant presented a model of a blast furnace. Other workers also presented gifts. The other lectures and symposiums were also filled with deep friendship and love between the Chinese and Soviet people. More than 20,000 middle school students continuously applauded enthusiastically when they heard the Soviet combat hero Kozhedub tell the story of how he shot down 62 enemy planes in the Patriotic War. Students from the Municipal Girls' No. 1 Middle School presented the attending Soviet representatives with a pair of white doves of peace. Students from Tsinghua and Yanjing Universities welcomed the Secretary of the Moscow Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, Sizov, and three other representatives to Tsinghua Park with fervent enthusiasm. They listened to Sizov's report on the state of Soviet university education, the students' study situation, and the role of the Communist Youth League in the school.

In addition, Soviet representatives also participated in symposiums on propaganda, organization, and youth farmers' work, and gave lectures to workers in sports, art, and propaganda and education.
