Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 13th: TASS, Moscow, May 10th—The Soviet Union's State Political Literature Publishing House recently published an album entitled "Materials from the Trial of Former Japanese Armed Forces Personnel Accused of Preparing and Using Bacteriological Weapons." Both Pravda and Izvestia published articles commenting on the book.

　　Vasiliev, in an article entitled "The Crimes of the Aggressors Have Been Exposed!" in Pravda, stated: The materials from the Khabarovsk trial collected in the album expose the heinous crimes committed by Japanese imperialists in preparing and using bacteriological weapons. Despite this, the U.S. and British governments have yet to formally respond to the Soviet Union's note regarding the trial of the instigators and organizers of Japanese bacteriological warfare, headed by Hirohito, which the Soviet Union presented to the governments of China, the United States, and the United Kingdom on February 1st based on the materials from the Khabarovsk trial. Therefore, the U.S. and British ruling cliques have brazenly abandoned their international obligations regarding the punishment of war criminals and exposed themselves as direct protectors and accomplices of Japanese war criminals. Telenin wrote in Izvestia: The incriminating materials collected in the case of the Japanese bacteriological warfare criminals are also an indictment of the new war provokers. The U.S. government's concealing those criminals who bear the main responsibility for bacteriological warfare is a means of restoring Japan's war potential. However, the more ferocious, bloodthirsty, and unscrupulous the new war provokers are, the more powerful the people's will to fight for peace will be, multiplied a thousandfold.

　　真理报指出侵略者罪行已被揭破
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：苏联国家政治读物出版局最近出版《被控犯有准备及使用细菌武器罪的前日本武装部队人员审讯案材料》的专辑。真理报与消息报皆著文评论该书。
    瓦西里耶夫在真理报上以《侵略者的罪行已被揭破！》为题撰文称：收集在专辑中的伯力审讯材料，揭露了日本帝国主义者所曾进行的准备及使用细菌武器的滔天罪行。虽然如此，可是，美英两国政府迄未正式答复苏联关于审讯以裕仁为首的日本细菌战的鼓舞者与组织者的照会，而苏联这一照会是根据伯力审讯案的材料而在二月一日向中、美、英三国政府提出的。因此，美英统治集团就蛮横地背弃了他们关于惩治战犯的国际义务，并暴露出他们就是日本战犯的直接保护者与同谋者。特莱宁在消息报上撰文称：日本细菌战犯一案所收集的定罪材料，也是对新战争挑拨者的起诉书。美国政府藏匿那些应负细菌战主要责任的罪犯，就是恢复日本战争潜力的一种手段。但是，新战争挑拨者越是凶狠好杀和肆无忌惮，人民争取和平的意志也就越加千百倍的强大。
