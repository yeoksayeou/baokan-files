　　Financial Conference Revises This Year's Budget
    Gansu Eliminates Fiscal Deficit
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Xi'an Masses Daily, the Gansu Provincial Financial Conference in mid-April, based on the resolutions of the central and Northwest Financial Conferences and in light of the actual conditions in Gansu, specifically arranged tasks for tax collection, public grain, and public bonds, adhering to the spirit of "careful calculation and use of every penny." It formulated methods for the allocation of various operating expenses under the principle of "reducing expenditures and focusing on key areas." At the same time, it re-demarcated administrative regions, reorganized institutions and personnel, and discussed and decided on specific plans for issues such as clearing warehouses, establishing treasuries and granaries, financial systems, and financial supervision. The greatest success and gain of the conference was the re-formulation of the revenue and expenditure budget for Gansu Province in 1950. In the new budget, Gansu Province's income for this year increased by 43.68 percent, and expenditures decreased by 73.71 percent. Not only was the original budget deficit of 75.45 percent eliminated, but there was also a surplus. In the grain revenue and expenditure budget, the new budget, compared with the old one, not only eliminated the old budget deficit of 61 percent, but also had a considerable surplus of grain.
    The conference used the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, first clearing the cadres' minds and then solving specific problems. Before the meeting, the representatives generally had incorrect ideas such as bargaining and departmentalism. After listening to reports from various leaders and the transmission of resolutions from the Northwest Financial Conference, they gained a new understanding of unified financial and economic work. The representatives also reflected on and examined their ideological work style, deepening their understanding of the great significance of unified financial and economic work. They transformed from initially emphasizing ethnic complexity, vast regions, and famine to resolutely implementing the decision on unified financial and economic work, overcoming all obstacles and difficulties, and ensuring the completion of tasks.

　　财政会议重订今年概算
    甘肃财政赤字消除
    【本报讯】据西安群众日报消息：甘肃省四月中旬财政会议根据中央及西北财政会议的决议，结合甘肃实际情况，本着精打细算，及一文不漏的精神，具体布置了税收、公粮、公债任务，在“缩减开支重点使用”的原则下，制定了各项事业费的分配办法，同时重行划订了行政区域，整编了机构人员，并对清理仓库、建立金库、粮库，财政制度，及财政监督等问题，也讨论决定了具体方案。会议最大的成功及收获，就是重新制定了甘肃省一九五零年的收支概算。在新的经费收支概算中，使甘肃省本年度的收入增加了百分之四十三点六八，支出减少了百分之七十三点七一，不但原预算的百分之七十五点四五的赤字没有了，而且还有富余，在粮食的收支概算中，新概算和旧概算比较，不仅消灭了旧概算中百分之六十一的赤字，并有相当数量的余粮。
    会议运用了批评与自我批评的武器，先打通干部思想，后再解决具体问题。开会前，与会代表普遍存在着讨价还价及本位主义等不正确思想，经听取了各首长报告及关于西北财政会议决议传达后，对于统一财经工作才有了新的认识。各代表并对思想作风进行反省与检讨，更加深认识了统一财经工作的重大意义，由起初强调民族复杂、地区辽阔、灾荒等，转变为坚决执行统一财经工作决定，克服一切障碍与困难，保证完成任务。
