　　The "Iron Tiger" on the Great Northern Wilderness
    Eighty-One Five Farm, Zhang Xinyao
    Spring plowing has begun. The tractors that are reclaiming the Great Northern Wilderness have also emerged from the garage one after another, some with two plows, some with three, and the most with no more than five. But the last one out is pulling ten plows. This tractor is the "Stalin 80" tractor, recently allocated by the Mechanical Land Reclamation Bureau. This tractor, standing among our pioneering tools, is like a camel in a flock of sheep. It stands out exceptionally.
    The vast grasslands are being turned over, one after another, and rows of oily black soil are increasing, surrounded by people on all sides. The nearby villagers are scrambling to see it – this extraordinary tractor. Old Zhang said, "Look, it's pulling such a big ten plows, so powerful. The plows we used to reclaim the land weren't even this big, and one would take six horses to pull, and still not turn it over this well. This machine is equivalent to sixty or seventy horses!" Old Ma, who drives a cart, said, "Before, we thought those 'Iron Ox' (referring to the Stalin 52 horsepower tractors) were pretty good, but this thing should be called 'Iron Tiger'!" Everyone laughed at what he said. Someone in the crowd shouted loudly, "Look at it. This is something from our Soviet big brother, how good it is! This time, the Great Northern Wilderness can't be barren anymore." The tractor passed in front of the crowd. People's smiling faces followed the afterimage of the "Iron Tiger." People are watching it with such admiration because it will bring everyone infinite happiness and hope.
    From then on, this "Stalin 80" tractor was called the "Iron Tiger" by everyone. This "Iron Tiger" is not only fuel-efficient but also has a high work efficiency. Calculated on the basis of ten hours of work per day, it can plow seventeen *qing*, using only one hundred and sixty kilograms of diesel. In the spring plowing of the "Eighty-One Five" farm, this "Iron Tiger" achieved the most significant results due to the careful maintenance and inspection by driver Comrade Zhao Guangyuan. In the spring plowing summary, comparing the plowed area of each machine and the amount of oil used per *qing*, this "Iron Tiger" won first place. The blackboard in front of the work station tent wrote: "Our Iron Tiger has won the championship." Driver Comrade Zhao Guangyuan was also rewarded.
    At night, in order to rush the spring plowing task, the "Iron Tiger" widened its bright eyes and let out a huge roar, as if shouting "Great Northern Wilderness, Great Northern Wilderness, I must help you, cultivate you, and prevent you from being barren again!"

　　北大荒上的“铁虎”
    八一五农场　张鑫尧
    春耕开始了。开拓北大荒的拖拉机也一台一台地走出了车库，有的带着两个铧犁，有的带着三个铧犁，最多也不超过五个铧犁，而最后出来的这台，却拖着十个铧子。这台拖拉机，是最近由机械农垦管理局拨来的“斯大林八○号”拖拉机。这部拖拉机站在我们的开拓工具队中，真象羊群中的骆驼一样。分外出众。
    广大的草原，一面一面翻过去，油黑的土，一排一排地多起来，四外围满了人。附近的老乡们，都抢着来看。这台出奇的拖拉机。老张头说：“你看，拉了这么大的十个铧子，多么有劲。我们开荒使的铧子，还没有这样大，一个就得六匹马拉，还翻不这样好。这台机器足足顶六、七十匹马呀！”赶大车的老马说：“以前我们看那些‘铁牛号’（指斯大林五二马力拖拉机）就挺好，这个东西就得把他叫‘铁虎’了！”说得大家都笑起来。人群中又有人大声地喊出来：“看看吧。这是咱们苏联大哥的东西，多么好啊！这回北大荒可不能再荒了。”拖拉机从人群眼前走过去。人们的笑脸，追随着“铁虎”的后影。人们是如此欣慕地望着它，因为它会给大家带来无限的幸福和希望。
    这以后，这台“斯大林八○号”拖拉机，就被大家叫作“铁虎”了。这台“铁虎”不但省油，工作率效也大。每日以十小时工作算，可翻地十七垧，用柴油一百六十公斤即可。这台“铁虎”，在“八一五”农场的春耕中，由于驾驶员赵光远同志精心的保养与检查，做出了最显著的成绩。春耕总结中，以每台机器的翻地面积，及每垧地用油量做比较，这台“铁虎”号，荣获第一名。作业所帐棚前的黑板报上写出了：“我们的铁虎号荣获冠军”。驾驶员赵光远同志也受到了奖励。
    夜间为了突击春耕任务，“铁虎”瞪大了它的明亮眼睛，发出来巨大的吼声，好象在喊着“北大荒，北大荒，我一定要帮助你，培植你，不使你再荒芜下去！”
