Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 19th: The liberation of Zhoushan has brought boundless joy and encouragement to the people of Shanghai. A spokesman for the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, representing Shanghai's million workers, issued a statement warmly celebrating the great victory of liberating Zhoushan. He pointed out that this victory is extremely closely related to Shanghai. This victorious news has encouraged the Shanghai workers who are struggling against the temporary difficulties created by the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek, especially our unemployed worker brothers. The spokesman continued: We believe that with the sympathy and support of the working class and the People's Liberation Army throughout the country, as well as people from all walks of life, we will surely be able to overcome all kinds of difficulties. We must intensify production, pledge to support the front lines with all our strength, fight for the earlier liberation of Taiwan, the elimination of the remnants of the Chiang bandits, and avenge the workers who died in the bombings. Sailors and dockworkers, who have suffered even greater difficulties, were even more excited when they heard the news of Zhoushan's liberation. The Seamen's Union stated: In the past, the North and South Sea routes were almost completely suspended, and inland river navigation on the Yangtze River was often subjected to bombing by U.S.-made bandit aircraft. Now, conditions are in place to resume navigation. The sailors will unite and take up their posts, support the army in liberating Taiwan, and develop the country's shipping industry. Dockworkers also believe that with the resumption of shipping, dockworkers will have more job opportunities. Workers in other industries are also congratulating each other. Many blackboards and wall newspapers are filled with victory reports and large red characters of happiness, celebrating the victory of Zhoushan's liberation.
    Industrial and commercial figures expressed their increased confidence in overcoming current difficulties. Rong Yiren, General Manager of Shanghai Private Shenxin Textile Company, said: "The liberation of Zhoushan has basically declared the bankruptcy of the U.S.-Chiang blockade and bombing, and more importantly, it has greatly increased the confidence of the industrial and commercial sectors in overcoming difficulties." He said: "The liberation of Zhoushan has made our industrial and commercial circles more aware that the way to overcome difficulties is to fulfill the obligation of purchasing bonds and paying taxes, vigorously support the front lines, and strive for the early liberation of Taiwan." Bao Dasan, General Manager of Shanghai Xinyi Real Estate Company, said: "The liberation of Zhoushan is particularly important for the industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai. We are no longer afraid of the bandit gang's blockade. With the help of the People's Government, the industrial and commercial sectors will gradually overcome the current difficulties." People in Shanghai's fishing industry excitedly said: Zhoushan is one of China's famous fishing grounds, and it exports more than three million dan of fresh and salted fish to Shanghai every year. Furthermore, it buys back industrial products from Shanghai. The revival of this material exchange will have a great impact. Shanghai's import and export industries are now actively planning to reorganize their operations, and the chemical, rubber, and yarn factories are also actively preparing to transport raw materials stored outside the city before liberation back to Shanghai in order to restore and develop production.

　　舟山解放有益工商业恢复
　　上海人民欢欣祝捷克服困难信心更强
    【新华社上海十九日电】舟山的解放，给上海人民带来了无限的欢欣和鼓舞。上海总工会发言人代表上海百万工人发表谈话，热烈庆贺解放舟山的巨大胜利。他指出这个胜利对上海的关系是太密切了。这一胜利消息鼓舞了正和美蒋制造的暂时困难进行斗争的上海工人，特别是目前处于失业情况的工人弟兄们。发言人继指出：我们相信在全国工人阶级及人民解放军与各界人民的同情与支援之下，我们一定能够战胜各种困难。我们一定要加紧搞好生产，誓以一切力量支援前线，为更快地解放台湾、消灭蒋匪残余，为在轰炸中死难的工友复仇而斗争。遭受困难更多的海员和码头工人在知道舟山解放的消息后，更是兴奋万分。海员工会表示：过去南北洋航线几乎完全停顿，长江内河航行也时常遭受美制匪机的轰炸。现在，已经有条件恢复通航了。海员们将团结一致，走上工作岗位，支援大军解放台湾，发展国家的航运事业。码头工人们也认为：随着航运恢复，码头工人也将得到更多的就业机会。其他各业工人也莫不争相道贺。许多黑板报和墙报上都写了捷报和画着大红喜字，庆祝解放舟山的胜利。
    工商界人士表示对克服目前困难增加了无限的信心。上海私营申新纺织公司总管理处总经理荣毅仁说：“舟山的解放，已基本上宣布了蒋美封锁和轰炸的破产，更重大的意义是由此大大提高了工商界克服困难的信心。”他说：“舟山的解放，更加使我们工商界认识到克服困难的办法就是完成购债和纳税的义务，大力支援前线，争取早日解放台湾。”上海信义地产公司总经理包达三说：“舟山解放对于上海的工商界是特别重要的，我们从此不怕匪帮的封锁了。在人民政府帮助下，工商业界一定可以逐步克服目前的困难。”上海渔业界人士兴奋地说：舟山是我国著名渔场之一，每年单对上海输出的鲜、腌鱼即在三百万担以上，再从上海买回工业品，这种物资交流的复活，影响是很大的。沪市进出口行业现已纷纷计划整顿营业，化工、机胶、纱厂等工业界也积极准备运回解放前存在外地的原料，以便恢复与发展生产。
