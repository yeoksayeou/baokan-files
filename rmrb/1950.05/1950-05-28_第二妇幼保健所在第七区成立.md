　　Second Maternal and Child Health Center Established in the Seventh District
　　[Our Newspaper] The Beijing Municipal People's Government Public Health Bureau has established the Second Maternal and Child Health Center in the Seventh District (formerly the Tenth District), which began outpatient services on the 22nd. The center is divided into obstetrics and gynecology and pediatrics. In addition to outpatient services, it also regularly conducts children's health check-ups, vaccinations, and home deliveries in the designated area. Free assistance is available for deliveries for impoverished women.
　　The Seventh District has a population of over 105,000, most of whom are working people, but there is only one hospital. After liberation, the People's Government, in order to take care of the health of the working people, first established a workers' clinic in the district, and now has established the Second Maternal and Child Health Center.

　　第二妇幼保健所在第七区成立
    【本报讯】京市人民政府公共卫生局在第七区（原第十区）设立了第二妇幼保健所，已于二十二日开始门诊。该所分妇产科与小儿科，除门诊外并经常进行儿童健康检查、防疫注射、地段接生等工作。对贫苦妇女接生有免费办法。
    第七区共有十万五千余人口，其中以劳动人民最多，但只有一个医院。解放后，人民政府为照顾劳动人民健康，在该区首先成立了工人诊疗所，现又成立了第二妇幼保健所。
