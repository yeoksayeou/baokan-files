Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 20th: Millions of farmers in various parts of Zhejiang are now engaged in an unprecedented campaign to eliminate rice stem borers by collecting borer eggs and catching adult moths before rice seedlings are transplanted. In rural areas such as Jiaxing, Hangxian, and Yuyao, men, women, old, and young have all gone into the fields to compete in the capture. Government cadres and Communist Party members have taken an active leading role, with many commissioners and county heads personally going into the fields to eliminate pests.

Rice stem borer infestation is a major enemy of farmers in Zhejiang Province. Before liberation, severe borer infestations resulted in no harvest in rice fields. The annual reduction in rice production due to borer infestations throughout the province was around 2 billion jin. Last winter was warm, and many pests in the fields were not frozen to death, making borer infestations a common threat felt by farmers in the province this year. In order to ensure the completion of this year's target of increasing grain production by 600 million jin, the Zhejiang Provincial People's Government, based on the suggestion of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, has launched a large-scale manual pest elimination campaign. It has been decided to mobilize farmers to go into the fields to catch pests every spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and to implement this continuously year after year, with the aim of eradicating them completely. On the 7th of this month, the Zhejiang Provincial Government issued an instruction on the prevention and control of diseases and insect pests. Given that the current period is the egg-laying season for rice stem borer moths, it issued an emergency mobilization order on the 11th for a concentrated effort to collect borer eggs and eliminate moths. A temporary reward measure for collecting borer eggs in seedling fields was also issued, calling on farmers throughout the province to take immediate action and launch a "everyone participate, every household eliminates pests" campaign, striving to clear the borer eggs from seedling fields in about half a month. Disease and pest control stations have been established in the grain and cotton core production areas of Hangxian, Jiaxing, Yuyao, Xiaoshan, Wenzhou, Jinhua, and Quzhou, while prevention and control groups have been established in Lin'an, Lishui, and Taizhou to assist and guide pest control work in various areas.

After the mobilization order was issued, conferences on borer control work were held in various parts of the province, and cadres were dispatched to the countryside. Governments at all levels quickly established pest control headquarters, while rural areas organized pest control brigades and teams. Within four or five days, the campaign gradually unfolded throughout the province. Inspired by the People's Government's determination to eliminate pests, the masses of farmers gradually eliminated superstitious ideas and concerns about "lack of unity," and enthusiastically went into the fields to collect eggs and catch moths. The personal example of the commissioners and county heads in Jiaxing and other areas in going into the fields further encouraged the farmers' enthusiasm for pest control. Primary schools in rural areas throughout the province also generally had a seven-day vacation, partly for pest control and partly for publicity about pest control. Women and children played a significant role in this pest control campaign. For example, teachers and students from eighteen primary schools in Jiangshan Township, Yinxian County, collected more than 30,000 borer egg masses, weighing more than 100 jin, in three days, equivalent to killing more than 100 million borer larvae in the autumn. In addition, after organizing themselves, farmers in various areas, in addition to collecting borer eggs and catching moths, also universally captured and killed other agricultural and forestry pests. For example, farmers in Tangxi County killed more than 145,000 jin of pine caterpillars in seven days, saving more than 11,000 mu of *Masson pine* forest from insect damage.

　　浙江展开除螟运动
    数百万农民下田竞赛捕捉
    【新华社杭州二十日电】浙江各地数百万农民现正于稻田插秧之前，展开了一个空前规模的采摘螟卵、捕捉螟蛾的除螟运动。嘉兴、杭县、余姚等地农村男女老幼均已下田竞赛捕捉。人民政府的干部、中共党员起了积极的带头作用，许多专员、县长均亲自下田除虫。
    稻作螟害为浙省农民大敌。解放前螟害剧烈时稻田颗粒不收，常年全省每年因螟害减收的水稻也在二十亿斤左右。去冬天暖，田间害虫多未冻死，螟害为该省农民今年普遍感到的威胁。浙江省人民政府为保证完成今年增产粮食六亿斤的任务，特根据中共浙江省委会的建议，发动大规模的人力除虫运动，决定每年春夏秋冬四季均发动农民下田捕捉，并连年贯彻，以期根绝。本月七日，浙江省府即据此发布了一个防治病虫害的指示，并鉴于目前正是螟蛾产卵期，特又于十一日发布突击采摘螟卵、扑灭螟蛾的紧急动员令，随令颁发了秧田采摘螟卵临时奖励办法；号召全省农民立即行动起来，展开“人人动手、家家除虫”的运动，争取在半月左右肃清秧田中的螟卵。粮棉中心产区的杭县、嘉兴、余姚、萧山、温州、金华、衢州等地均设立了病虫害防治站，临安、丽水、台州等地设立了防治小组，以协助并指导各地的除虫工作。
    动员令发布后，全省各地即纷纷召开治螟工作会议，派遣干部下乡。各级政府均迅速建立了除虫指挥部，农村则组织了除虫大队、中队等组织。四、五天后，这一运动即在省内各地逐渐展开。农民群众在人民政府的除虫决心的感召下，也都逐渐消除了迷信观念和“怕不齐心”的顾虑，踊跃下田摘卵捉蛾。嘉兴等专区的专员和县长的亲自带头下田，更鼓舞了农民的除虫热情。全省农村小学也普遍放假七天，一面除虫，一面作除虫的宣传。妇女、儿童在这次除虫运动中起的作用很大，如鄞县姜山乡十八个小学的师生，三天即采摘螟卵三万多块，重一百多斤，等于秋天捕杀一百多万万条螟虫。此外，各地农民组织起来后，除采摘螟卵、捕捉螟蛾外，还普遍捕打了其他农林的害虫。如汤溪县农民在七天内捕杀松虫达十四万五千余斤，使面积一万一千多亩的马尾松林得免虫害。
