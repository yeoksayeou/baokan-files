　　Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 11th. The spring afforestation work in the Central-South Region has basically concluded. According to incomplete statistics, the total afforestation area in the region has reached over 80,000 mu, with over 20 million trees planted. To prepare for a larger-scale afforestation campaign next spring, state-owned farms and nurseries in various provinces of the Central-South Region have now begun to systematically cultivate over 81 million seedlings of pine, fir, tung, and tea trees. Around Qingming Festival this year, local people's governments in the Central-South Region organized farmers to create flood control forests in areas along rivers and lakes. The Henan Provincial People's Government mobilized farmers to plant willows along the entire Yellow River embankment. In order to prevent the shifting sands of the Yellow River from damaging crops, the Chenliu Special District of the province planted a total of 8 million windbreak and sandbreak trees in various counties. Along the East River and West River in Guangdong Province, over 2 million flood control trees were planted. Saplings have also been widely planted along the main highways in various parts of the Central-South Region. In addition, many farmers have spontaneously planted trees on the edges of fields, wasteland, and around villages. For example, farmers in Guomen Village, Shangrao County, Jiangxi Province, planted 100,000 pine trees on about 600 mu of land on forty hilltops. Simultaneously with afforestation, local people's governments have also issued forest protection notices, and many townships and villages have developed forest protection plans to improve the survival rate of the planted trees.

　　中南区植树二千万株
　　春季造林工作基本结束
    【新华社汉口十一日电】中南区春季造林工作已基本结束。据不完全统计，全区造林面积共达八万余亩，植树二千余万株。为着准备明春展开更大规模的造林运动，中南各省公营农场与苗圃现在已经开始有计划地培育松、杉、桐、茶等树苗八千一百余万株。今年清明前后，中南区各地人民政府都组织农民在沿江沿湖地带营造了防洪林。河南省人民政府动员农民在黄河沿岸进行了全线插柳。该省陈留专区为防止黄河流沙侵害庄稼，曾在各县种植防风防沙林共达八百万株。广东省东江、西江两水沿岸共植防洪树二百余万株。中南区各地主要公路两旁也普遍种上了树苗。此外，并有不少农民利用田边、废地、庄头自动栽树，如江西省上饶县郭门村农民将四十座山头约六百亩山地种植了十万株松树。与植林同时，各地人民政府并发出护林布告，很多乡、村更订出护林的计划，以提高植树的成活率。
