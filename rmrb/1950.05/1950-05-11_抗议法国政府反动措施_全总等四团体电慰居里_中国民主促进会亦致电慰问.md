The telegram is as follows:

To Professor Joliot-Curie:

On behalf of the vast number of workers, women, youth, and students in China, we extend our highest respect and sincere condolences to you – a brave warrior who persists in fighting for world peace, and protest against the French government, which takes its cue from American imperialism, for unreasonably removing you from your position as a member of the French Atomic Energy Commission. This reactionary measure by the French government is detrimental to the cause of world peace. However, we firmly believe that under the heroic struggle of the French people and the people of the world to defend world peace, the schemes of the warmongers will surely fail.

Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: The China Association for Promoting Democracy has sent a telegram of condolence to the French scientist Professor Joliot-Curie, protesting the French reactionary government's dismissal of Professor Curie from his positions as High Commissioner for Atomic Energy and member of the Atomic Energy Commission. The telegram stated:

To Professor Joliot-Curie:

The Pidault reactionary government, under the instruction of American imperialism, has brazenly dismissed you from your positions as High Commissioner for Atomic Energy and member of the Atomic Energy Commission. This is by no means hostility and a threat to you alone, but an open provocation to peace-loving people all over the world. In addition to lodging a serious protest against this reckless measure by the French reactionary government, we will call on a broader mass of people to unite more closely under the banner of defending lasting world peace, and resolutely struggle to respond to the tyrannical behavior of the reactionary regimes that are hostile to world peace. We extend our sincere condolences.
