　　Guangdong Overseas Remittances Recovering
　　Special Correspondent of this Newspaper Xiao Hang
　　There are about ten million overseas Chinese scattered in Southeast Asia, the Americas, and other places, the vast majority of whom are originally from Fujian and Guangdong provinces. Overseas, they mostly do hard labor, saving part of their monthly wages and sending it back to their hometowns to support their families. This amount of overseas remittances is substantial, amounting to approximately 100 million US dollars before the war. According to calculations by the South China Branch of the People's Bank of China, the overseas remittances in 1931 were equivalent to 51% of China's import surplus, and in 1935, they were equivalent to 92%, almost offsetting the import surplus. Moreover, South China's annual overseas remittance income could offset North China's total exports for two years. The role of overseas remittances in our country's economic construction is very obvious. In the national economic life of Guangdong, overseas remittances occupy an even greater proportion. Millions of overseas Chinese dependents rely on it to maintain their lives and carry out production. Taking the Chaoshan area as an example, according to statistics from 1935-36, the area imported about 2 million dan of grain annually, as well as a large amount of fertilizer, all of which was offset by overseas remittances. In the central Guangdong, Xijiang, and Dongjiang areas, many schools relied entirely on overseas remittances for support. When overseas remittances stopped, the number of students in each school sharply decreased, or they were forced to close. Moreover, the smooth flow of overseas remittances can increase the purchasing power of Guangdong's rural areas and accelerate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. Therefore, shortly after the liberation of Guangdong, the People's Government established specific policies to restore overseas remittances. These are: (1) Foreign exchange belongs to the public, that is, overseas remittances are converted into the government's foreign exchange; (2) Profits belong to the private sector, that is, ensuring the reasonable profits of overseas remittance agencies (privately-owned firms handling overseas remittances); (3) Protecting the value of overseas Chinese remittances. In order to effectively carry out this work, the Guangzhou branch of the Bank of China specially established an Overseas Chinese Service Department last November to handle overseas remittance business and provide various services for overseas Chinese. Since January of this year, overseas remittances have been increasing month by month. If February is taken as the base, then March was 195, and the first half of April has already reached 125. The staff of the Overseas Chinese Service Department often say with some joy when talking about their business: "Things are going quite smoothly." Although they say so, there are still many difficulties in the work. In order to find a correct path, they have repeatedly studied, sent people to visit overseas Chinese dependents to understand their psychology and situation, and have also encountered some setbacks. Taking the investigation of overseas Chinese affairs as an example, initially, overseas Chinese dependents ignored them. This was not only because many overseas Chinese dependents did not understand the policies of the People's Government, but also because they had a very bad impression of the past Bank of China. After repeated education by the staff, the overseas Chinese dependents slowly raised some questions and requested solutions. At the same time, through overseas Chinese dependents, overseas Chinese students, and propaganda materials, they conducted publicity among overseas Chinese to help them understand the situation in the motherland and recognize the overseas remittance policies of the People's Government. After that, overseas remittances gradually recovered somewhat. Up to now, they have gained some preliminary experience.
　　Those familiar with the situation of overseas remittances all know that the main reason for the failure of the Kuomintang reactionary government in handling overseas remittances was the unreasonable exchange rate, which resulted in an average of 81% of overseas remittances flowing into the black market every year since 1946. Therefore, from the beginning, we tried to set a reasonable exchange rate, regarding it as a key to handling overseas remittances. Initially, it was converted according to the foreign exchange rate of the People's Bank of China, which only briefly approached the black market price. After that, the distance widened, and the value of overseas remittances could not be maintained. Therefore, from January 3 of this year, the closing price of the foreign exchange market was used as the standard for paying overseas remittances. Because the exchange was freely negotiated in the past, its price was at least no lower than the black market price, and sometimes even exceeded it. Adopting such an exchange rate has had a very good effect. Therefore, even under the conditions that overseas Chinese did not understand the domestic situation and price fluctuations, overseas remittances still gradually increased. Since March 3, the People's Bank of China has uniformly determined the national overseas remittance exchange rate. This exchange rate is even higher. For example, the unified exchange rate on March 18 was 6,460 yuan for Hong Kong dollars, while the closing price of the foreign exchange market was 6,390 yuan, and only reached 6,420 yuan from the 21st to the 25th. During the same period, the black market always fluctuated between 6,200 and 6,300 yuan. Therefore, the increase in overseas remittances in March was closely related to the exchange rate.
　　However, this did not solve all the problems, and overseas Chinese raised new demands. According to past practice, foreign remittances had to be converted into local currency and then mailed. In this way, from the place of remittance to the place of receipt, such as from Southeast Asia to Guangzhou, it took ten days. Under the condition of price fluctuations, the exchange rate often adjusted within ten days, so even if there was a reasonable exchange rate, it could not guarantee the loss during the remittance process. Therefore, the Bank of China adopted the method of "original currency remittance," that is, remitting in the original currency abroad and paying in RMB at the preferential exchange rate of the day upon arrival in China. In this way, the value of overseas remittances has been effectively guaranteed. Whenever overseas Chinese dependents come to collect the money, the staff of the Overseas Chinese Service Department solicit opinions. All overseas Chinese dependents unanimously expressed satisfaction with the exchange rate and the method of handling overseas remittances. However, many overseas Chinese dependents, although they received the remittances, did not need to spend the money immediately. During the period of price fluctuations, saving RMB would still be a disadvantage. To solve this problem, the Bank of China has taken two measures: one is "original currency overseas remittance deposit," and once the money is needed, the original currency is paid at the preferential exchange rate of the day. This is very popular among overseas Chinese dependents. From February 25 to April 19, there were already 491 Hong Kong dollar depositors. The other is to handle real-value savings on behalf of them, that is, to convert the original currency into RMB and deposit it into the Bank of Communications. In addition, to make it convenient for overseas Chinese dependents in the countryside to collect money, the Bank of China has designated branches in various places, or entrusted local institutions of the People's Bank of China, to handle original currency transfers, so that overseas Chinese dependents can collect money nearby without paying handling fees. Since the start of this business, fifty or sixty transfers have been made.
　　As everyone knows, overseas Chinese are severely oppressed by the local reactionary governments abroad, and remittances are not free. For example, several regions in Southeast Asia limit overseas Chinese to remitting only 45 Singapore dollars per person per month, equivalent to 83.35 Hong Kong dollars, equivalent to 590,100 RMB at the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate on April 18. If it is a family of five, this amount is not enough. Therefore, overseas Chinese cannot but think of other ways to send money back to their motherland, which is through overseas remittance agencies. There are thousands of overseas remittance agencies in Southeast Asia, and hundreds in Hong Kong. There are fewer in China, but they are familiar with overseas Chinese affairs and are indeed effective in handling overseas remittances, and still have a positive role to play in facilitating overseas remittances. The Guangzhou Military Control Commission promulgated the Interim Measures for the Management of Overseas Remittance Agencies in South China on December 7 last year, granting them reasonable profits under the principle of "foreign exchange belongs to the public, profits belong to the private sector," and further transforming them. In this regard, Shantou City has already made achievements. Most of the overseas remittance agencies in the city have established relationships with national banks. From November 11 last year to January 14 this year, the overseas remittance agencies have received 151,800 overseas remittance letters (at least one remittance per letter). After February, the quantity has increased significantly.
　　From all indications, the recovery of overseas remittances in Guangdong is relatively fast. Especially since April, the transferred areas have expanded considerably, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hunan, and other places, and overseas remittances from the Americas have also increased. The current problem is how to determine a reasonable exchange rate that suits the conditions of various places. The current unified national exchange rate is completely suitable for the central Guangdong, Xijiang, and other areas, but it is somewhat different from the black market in the Dongjiang area. Taking April 19 as an example, the unified exchange rate was 6,310 yuan for Hong Kong dollars, which was the same as the closing price of the foreign exchange market, 100 to 200 yuan higher than the black market. However, in Shantou, the telegram received by the Bank of China indicated that the black market there had reached 7,000 yuan. This is a phenomenon caused by untimely supply of goods and ineffective promotion of RMB. The Guangzhou branch of the Bank of China and relevant financial and trade agencies are working to solve this problem. However, the biggest problem is still the issue of RMB going to the countryside. Therefore, overseas Chinese dependents have certain difficulties in obtaining living and production materials with RMB. However, after the financial prices tend to stabilize, this problem can also be solved in a short time.

### 广东侨汇恢复中

　　广东侨汇恢复中
    本报特派记者  萧航
    散处南洋、美洲等地的华侨，约有一千万，绝大多数的原籍是闽、粤两省。在国外，他们多半做苦工，把每月工资节省下来，寄回家乡，赡养眷属。这笔侨汇的数量很大，战前约有一亿美金。据中国人民银行华南区行计算，一九三一年的侨汇，相当于我国入超的百分之五十一，一九三五年相当于百分之九十二，几可抵销入超。而华南每年的侨汇收入，可抵华北二年的输出总额。侨汇在我们国家经济建设中的作用是很显然的。在广东的国民经济生活中，侨汇则占着更大的比重。上千万的侨眷依靠它来维持生活与进行生产。以潮汕地区为例，据一九三五——三六年的统计，该地每年输入粮食二百万担左右，另有大批肥料输入，全靠侨汇抵偿。在粤中、西江、东江等地区，许多学校全靠侨汇来支持，侨汇停滞，各校学生即锐减，或则停办。而且侨汇的疏通，可使广东的农村购买力提高，城乡物资加速交流。所以广东解放不久，人民政府即确定了恢复侨汇的具体政策。这就是：（一）外汇归公，即将侨汇变为政府的外汇；（二）利润归私，即保证侨批局（办理侨汇的私营行庄）的合理利润；（三）保障华侨的币值。为了有效地开展这一工作，广州中国银行于去年十一月专设了华侨服务部，办理侨汇业务，并代华侨办理各项服务工作。从今年一月起，侨汇逐月增加。如以二月份为基数，则三月份是一百九十五，四月上半月亦已达到一百二十五。华侨服务部的人员谈起他们的业务，常常带有几分喜悦地说：“事情总算相当顺利。”话虽这样说，工作中的困难还是不少的。为了摸索一条正确的道路，他们三番五次地研究，派人四出访问侨眷心理、情况，也碰过一些钉子。单拿调查侨情一项来说，最初，侨眷并不理睬他们，这不仅因为不少侨眷还不了解人民政府的政策，也由于对过去的中国银行有着很坏的印象，经过工作人员的再三教育，侨眷这才慢慢提出一些问题，要求解决。同时，通过侨眷，也通过华侨学生，以及宣传品，向海外华侨进行宣传，帮助他们了解祖国情况，认识人民政府的侨汇政策。此后，侨汇逐渐有些恢复。到现在为止，他们已经有了一套初步的经验。
    熟悉侨汇情况的人全知道，国民党反动政府办理侨汇之所以失败，其主要原因是牌价不合理，以致自一九四六年起，每年平均有百分之八十一的侨汇流入黑市。所以我们一开始，就想法厘定合理的牌价，把这看成是办理侨汇的一把钥匙。起初，是依照中国人民银行的外汇牌价折合，仅有短时间接近黑市价格，以后距离越来越远，侨汇的币值没法保持。乃自今年一月三日起，根据外汇交易所的收盘牌价，作为支付侨汇的标准。由于过去交易所是自由议价，其牌价至少不低于黑市，有时则还超过。采用这样的牌价，效果很好。所以，虽然在侨胞不大了解国内情况，以及物价波动的条件下，侨汇还是逐渐增加。自三月三日起，由中国人民银行统一确定全国侨汇牌价。这个牌价更高。例如三月十八日的统一牌价是港汇六千四百六十元，外汇交易所的收盘牌价是六千三百九十元，到二十一——二十五日，也只达到六千四百二十元。在同一时期内，黑市始终摆动在六千二百——三百元之间。所以三月份侨汇的增加，和牌价有着密切的关系。
    但是，这并没有解决了全部问题，侨胞提出了新的要求。照过去的惯例，国外汇款须将外币化为本币，然后付邮。这样，从汇出到收入地点，例如从南洋到广州，需要十天功夫，在物价波动的情况下，十天之内，牌价常有调整，所以即使有合理的牌价，也还不能保证汇寄途中的损失。于是中国银行采用了“原币汇款”的办法。即在国外以原币汇出，到达国内时按当日优待牌价折付人民币。这一来，侨汇的币值已经获得了确切的保障。每当侨眷来领款时，华侨服务部的人员，即征询意见，所有侨眷对于牌价以及办理侨汇的方法一致表示满意。不过，有不少侨眷虽然收到了汇款，但马上不需要花钱，在物价波动期间，存人民币还会吃亏。解决这一问题，中国银行采取了两种办法：一种是“原币侨汇存款”，一待用钱，把原币按当日优待牌价付给。这很受侨眷欢迎，自二月二十五日至四月十九日单是港币存户已有四百九十一户。一种是代办折实储蓄，即将原币折为人民币存入交通银行。此外，为使四乡侨眷领款方便，中国银行指定各地分行，或委托中国人民银行各地机构，代办原币转汇，使侨眷可以就近领款，而又不花手续费。自举办此项业务以来，已转汇五、六十笔。
    尽人皆知，侨胞在国外备受当地反动政府的压迫，汇款并不自由。如南洋若干地区即限制华侨每人每月只准外寄四十五元新加坡币，合港币八十三元三角五分，按四月十八日港汇牌价，合人民币五十九万零一百元。如是五口之家，这个数目就不够用。所以侨胞不能不想些另外的办法，把钱寄回祖国，这就是通过侨批局。侨批局在南洋有千多家，在香港也有几百家，国内较少，但熟悉侨情，办理侨汇确实有效，对疏通侨汇现在依然有其积极作用。广州市军管会于去年十二月七日颁布了华南区侨批业管理暂行办法，在“外汇归公，利润归私”的原则下，予以合理利润，并进而改造之。在这一方面，汕头市已经作出成绩，该市大多数侨批局已和国家银行建立关系。自去年十一月十一日至今年一月十四日止，侨批局已收侨批十五万一千八百封（每封至少一笔），二月以后，数量又有很大增加。
    从种种迹象看，广东侨汇的恢复是比较快的。尤其自四月份以来，转汇地区有了相当的扩展，包括了北京、天津、上海、浙江、江苏、湖南等地，而美洲的侨汇也有增加。目前存在的问题，是如何厘定切合各地情况的合理牌价，现在的全国统一牌价，在粤中、西江等地区完全适合，但在东江地区就与黑市有些距离。以四月十九日为例，统一牌价是港汇六千三百一十元，与外汇交易所收盘牌价相同，比黑市高出一至二百元。但在汕头，中国银行收到的电报指明，那里的黑市已达七千元。这是由于物资供应不及时，以及人民币推行不力所造成的现象。广州中国银行以及有关金融贸易机关正着手解决这个问题。但是，最大的问题还是人民币下乡的问题。因此，侨眷拿到人民币，换取生活与生产资料有着一定的困难。但在金融物价趋向稳定之后，这一问题，也能在短时间内得到解决。
