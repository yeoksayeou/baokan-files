　　Farmer Tang Dazong Saves a Train

　　At 13:10 on March 25th, two sections of rail were found broken at the 1088-kilometer mark of the Jinghan Railway's southern section, within the jurisdiction of Wangjiadian Station under the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau. At that time, Tang Dazong, a farmer from Luojia Village, was passing by and, upon discovering this serious situation, rushed to the station to report it. At this point, Express Train 138 had already departed from Huayuan Station, so the station immediately displayed a stop signal, halting the train outside the signal flag. Wang Ye, the stationmaster of Wangjiadian Station, quickly gathered his staff and rushed to repair the rails, with Tang Dazong actively assisting in the work. Twenty minutes later, Express Train 138 safely passed through, thus averting a major loss to state property.

　　农民唐大宗救了列车
    三月二十五日十三点十分，郑州路局管内京汉线南段，王家店车站辖区一○八八公里处，钢轨被压断两节。当时有罗家村农民唐大宗经过这里，发觉这一严重情况，就急忙跑到站上报告。这时候一三八次快车已由花园站开来，站上立即显示停车信号，使列车停在扬旗外。王家店站长王业就很快集合员工，赶接钢轨，唐大宗也积极帮助工作。二十分钟后，一三八次快车遂安全通过，国家财产因此避免一次重大损失。
