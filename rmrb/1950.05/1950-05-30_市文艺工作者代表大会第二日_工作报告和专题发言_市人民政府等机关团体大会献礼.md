[Beijing Municipal News Agency] The second day of the Beijing Municipal Literary and Art Congress, Yang Zhensheng served as the executive chairman in the morning. Wang Yaping reported on the "1950 Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education's Literary and Art Work Plan and Implementation," and Zhao Shuli and Tian Han made special speeches. Wang Yaping stated in his report that the 1950 Beijing Literary and Art Work Plan is: to widely carry out literary and art popularization work in line with the city's "Production First" policy, and to improve on the basis of popularization in a planned and focused manner; consolidate the united front in literary and art circles, strengthen leadership over the "Mass Literary and Art Creation Research Association" and the reform of opera; carry out factory literary and art work; and establish amateur schools for literary and art workers to further promote Beijing's literary and artistic work under the leadership of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought.

More than 400 members of the Mass Literature and Art Association

Zhao Shuli pointed out in his report "The Mass Literature and Art Creation Research Association and the Beijing Literary and Art Movement" that the Mass Literature and Art Creation Research Association has more than 400 members. Since its establishment, it has achieved considerable work results. In terms of publishing and creation, it has edited six weekly publications in the Xinmin Daily and the Tianjin Progressive Daily, and has also edited and published two kinds of publications, the monthly "Singing and Talking" and the bimonthly "Mass Literature and Art Communications." There are also various mass literature and art series. The published text has more than 2.4 million words. It has also carried out opera reform work jointly with relevant agencies and groups, helping old artists perform new operas, and opened up two new quyi performance venues, one is the Dazhong Amusement Club, and the other is the Xidan Amusement Club. He pointed out that the past work of the Mass Literature and Art Creation Research Association had a shortcoming, that is, it did not invite more experts to participate in guidance, and at the same time, it did not have close enough contact with relevant departments, which needs to be overcome. When Tian Han spoke, he pointed out that the new and old art is determined by its content and its ideology. In terms of content, anything that conforms to the interests of the broad masses of the people, whether it is in a new or old form, is good. In the afternoon, Li Bozhao served as the executive chairman. Liao Chengzhi, chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, and writer Ding Ling attended the meeting and spoke. Liao Chengzhi hoped that literary and art workers would create more works and carry out literary and art work in youth and children's teams. Ding Ling said in her speech that she had written an article for the conference. She gave a speech on the issues of studying Chairman Mao's literary and artistic thoughts on the spot. Then Li Dali and Zhang Menggeng made special speeches on how to build factory literature and art, and the reform of Beijing opera. Representatives Zhang Shirong, Tian Guangbi, Lin Shiliang, Wang Yaoqing, Xiao Changhua, Shang Heyu, Tan Xiaopei, Wang Shaolou, Shi Qiyuan, Lian Kuoru, Dai Hongsen, Li Bokang, Sun Jingxiu, Huang Jun, Zhu Lida, Yu Cun, Du Yunzhen, and Sun Yukui spoke in succession.

Worker representative Zhang Shirong hoped that literary and art workers would unite with workers. Lin Shiliang hoped that literary and art cadres would go to factories for a long time. Tian Guangbi talked about the experience and lessons of factory drama work combined with production.
