　　The People's Government Takes Practical and Effective Measures
    Shandong's Spring Famine Can Be Overcome
    【Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 25th】 To lead the disaster-stricken people through the short but difficult period before the wheat harvest, the Shandong Provincial People's Government has recently taken some practical and effective measures. First, the Provincial Government has increased the number of cadres sent to the countryside by more than 400. County governments, especially district and township governments, are now actively convening people's representative meetings to discuss and specifically plan how to overcome this short-term difficulty. Through the liaison of the Provincial Production and Disaster Relief Committee, the Shandong Provincial Native Produce Company, the Cooperative Marketing Society, the Salt Affairs Bureau and other departments have strengthened the purchasing of sideline products from disaster-stricken people, actively assisted private merchants in buying and selling, and encouraged the masses to sell their products themselves. The People's Government has further organized work relief programs, organizing disaster-stricken people to participate in grain transportation and Yellow River construction, spring repairs of water conservancy projects such as the Daomu River diversion project. In addition, all relief grain and funds, and loan grain are being distributed as quickly as possible. 30 million jin of relief grain and 3 million jin of relief salt were distributed in mid-May. According to statistics from the Bohai and Changwei areas alone, the loan grain distributed by the Provincial Grain Company recently reached 11 million jin.
    After the implementation of the above measures, the food shortage of disaster-stricken people throughout the province before the wheat harvest has been resolved, and the possible occurrence of summer famine in individual areas can be prevented. Recently, the Provincial Government has also allocated more than 80 million jin of trade grain originally intended for purchasing wheat, cotton, and hemp, and loaned it to disaster-stricken people in advance to pre-purchase cotton and hemp products from them.

　　人民政府采取切实有效措施
    山东春荒即可渡过
    【新华社济南二十五日电】为领导灾民渡过麦收前的为时很短却很困难的日子，山东省人民政府最近采取了一些切实有效的措施。省府首先增调了四百余干部下乡。各县政府特别是区、乡政府现正纷纷召开人民代表会议，讨论并具体计划如何渡过此短时的困难。经省生产救灾委员会的接洽，山东省土产公司、合作供销社、盐务局等部门已加强了对灾民副业产品的收购工作，并积极协助私商收售和鼓励群众自销。人民政府并已进一步组织以工代赈，组织灾民投入运粮及黄河工期春修、导沐等水利工程。此外，所有救济粮款和贷粮等均正加紧发放。救济粮三千万斤和救济盐三百万斤已于五月中旬发放完毕。省粮食分公司发放之贷粮，仅据渤海、昌潍地区统计，最近即已贷出一千一百万斤。
    上述措施实施后，全省灾民在麦收前的缺粮已获得解决，并可预防个别地区可能发生的夏荒。最近省府又将准备购买麦、棉、麻等的八千余万斤贸易粮拔出，先期贷予灾民，预购灾民的棉、麻产品。
