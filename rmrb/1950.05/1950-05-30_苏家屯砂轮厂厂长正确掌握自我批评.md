Siasutun Abrasives Factory Director Correctly Grasps Self-Criticism
[Our Siasutun Dispatch] Gao Zhutian, the director of the Siasutun Abrasives Factory, is brave in self-criticism and can correct his mistakes at any time. This good style of his powerfully inspires the enthusiasm of the workers and promotes the development of the factory's work. Once, he criticized worker Liu Xuncai. After others pointed out that the criticism was wrong, Director Gao immediately made a self-criticism at the general meeting of all employees, admitting his mistake. During a boiler repair, due to poor planning, more than ten million yuan were spent in vain, and a lot of manpower was wasted. Gao Zhutian also made a self-criticism on this matter at the general meeting of all employees. In March of this year, the factory leaders made the mistake of being lax first and then tightening up, resulting in serious overtime work. In addition to making a strict self-criticism at the meeting, Director Gao also told the factory correspondent to report this matter (which was published on the front page of the second edition of the Northeast Daily) to alert other factories. Under his influence, all employees launched mass criticism and self-criticism, which has led to the steady development of the factory's production work over the past year. The factory completed its production tasks for May of this year ahead of schedule.

　　苏家屯砂轮厂厂长正确掌握自我批评
    【本报苏家屯讯】苏家屯砂轮厂厂长高柱天勇于自我批评，能随时纠正错误。他这种好的作风，有力地启发了职工的积极性，推动了全厂工作的开展。有一次，他批评了工友刘训才，经别人指出是批评错了时，高厂长立即在全体职工大会上作了自我检讨，承认错误。在某次搬修锅炉时，由于计划不周，白花了一千多万元，并且浪费了不少人力。对于此事高柱天也在全体职工大会上做了检讨。今年三月份，该厂领导者犯了先松后紧的毛病，发生加班加点的严重现象，高厂长除了在大会上作严格的检讨外，并且告诉该厂通讯员，把这件事情报道出去（已刊登在东北日报二版头条地位），以引起别的工厂的警惕。全体职工在他的影响下，开展了群众性的批评与自我批评，使该厂一年来的生产工作步步发展。该厂今年五月份的生产任务，已提前完成。
