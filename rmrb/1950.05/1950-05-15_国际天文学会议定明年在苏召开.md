　　International Astronomical Conference Scheduled to be Held in Soviet Union Next Year
    [Xinhua News Agency, 14th] The International Astronomical Congress is scheduled to be held in Leningrad in August 1951. In preparation for this conference, a meeting of astronomers was held in Paris in April this year. Attendees included astronomers from the Soviet Union, Britain, France, Poland, the United States, and other countries. According to a TASS report, the head of the Soviet delegation attending the Paris conference, Ambarzumian (who discovered the new "stellar association" planetary system and won the Stalin Prize), stated that the Paris conference heard reports from astronomers on their work in calculating "astronomical constants." This work is related to determining the distance between the Earth and the Sun, more accurately determining the size and volume of the Earth, and the length of the Earth's radius. The Soviet representatives reported on the research done by Soviet astronomers on this important issue, and cited the works of the recently deceased Soviet Professor Krasovsky in determining the size and appearance of the Earth. Ambarzumian was also invited to report on his research on "stellar associations" at the Paris Institute of Astronomy.

　　国际天文学会议定明年在苏召开
    【新华社十四日讯】国际天文学家代表大会定于一九五一年八月在列宁格勒召开。为了筹备这次会议，今年四月间曾在巴黎召开了天文学家会议。出席者有苏、英、法、波、美等国天文学家。据塔斯社消息：参加巴黎会议的苏联代表团团长阿姆巴尔兹米扬（他曾发现新的“星协”行星系，荣获斯大林奖金）称：巴黎会议曾听取了天文学家在推算“天文学常数”方面的工作报告，此项工作关系到决定地球与太阳间的距离，更精确地决定地球的大小和容量，以及地球半径的长度等问题。苏联代表报告了苏联天文学家在这一重要问题上所作的研究，并举出最近逝世的苏联克拉索夫斯基教授在决定地球的大小和外貌方面的著作。阿姆巴尔兹米扬并曾应邀在巴黎天文学研究所报告了对“星协”的研究。
