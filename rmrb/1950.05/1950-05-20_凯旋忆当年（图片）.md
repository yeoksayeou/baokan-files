　　"Remembering the Triumphant Return of Yesteryear" is a series of picture books depicting the story of Li Guanghua's liberation. The complete set consists of twenty-six paintings and was published in the "Frontline" books and periodicals of the Political Department of the Fourth Field Army. We will reprint it continuously in this journal starting today. - Editor
　　Liberated hero Li Guanghua,
　　A thousand miles of triumphant return, laughing heartily;
　　He is welcomed on the march,
　　And encounters a sky full of snowflakes.
　　When the snowflakes fall, his old illness flares up,
　　The scars on his body ache terribly;
　　Thinking back and forth, his heart is filled with sorrow,
　　He grits his teeth and speaks out.
　　Comrades, oh comrades,
　　We must cherish this new nation;
　　In victory, don't forget the hardships of the past,
　　Listen to me carefully explain the roots.
　　First, let's talk about my leg,
　　The bowl-sized scar has turned purple;
　　My parents gave birth to me without any ailments,
　　I only hate the landlord Sun the Skinner.
　　At that time, I was young and lacked strength,
　　My family had no house or land;
　　I carried a broken basket to beg for food,
　　And my mother worked as a wet nurse for the landlord.

　　凯旋忆当年（一）
　　西虹词　西野书
　　“凯旋忆当年”是一套连环图书，描写李光华的翻身故事。全套共二十六幅，曾在第四野战军政治部出版的“前线”书刊上发表过，本日起在本刊连续转载。编者
　　翻身英雄李光华，
　　千里凯旋笑哈哈；
　　行军道上受欢迎，
　　又遇上满天飘雪花。
　　飘雪花他就老病发，
　　疼坏了身上的伤和疤；
　　思前想后心悲痛，
　　咬牙恨齿把话发。
　　同志们哪同志们，
　　咱们要爱护这新国家；
　　胜利别忘了当年的苦，
　　听我来仔细说根芽。
　　先说我的腿，
　　碗大的伤疤发了紫；
　　爹娘生我无毛病，
　　只恨地主孙剥皮。
　　那时我年幼少力气，
　　家中没房也没地；
　　我拿破筐去讨饭，
　　妈妈给地主当奶妈子。
