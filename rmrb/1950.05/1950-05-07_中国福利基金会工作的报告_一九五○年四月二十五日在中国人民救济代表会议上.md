The China Welfare Fund, since its inception, has been a people's organization. Its founder and leader, Vice Chairman of the Central People's Government Soong Ching Ling, has long been associated with the heroic struggle of the Chinese people. Therefore, in its appeals to the world, the China Welfare Fund has focused on the Chinese people's struggle to eliminate feudal forces, imperialism, and bureaucratic capitalism. It has always sought to link the struggles of the people of other countries with the struggle of the Chinese people, and in fact, the China Welfare Fund has consistently played a role in helping and promoting this struggle.

    The First Period

    The history of the China Welfare Fund can be divided into four periods. The first period began with its founding in Hong Kong in June 1938 and lasted until December 8, 1941, when Japanese imperialism occupied Hong Kong.

    During this period, the organization was called the China Defense League, and its main task was to support the War of Resistance and to be a part of the united front. The central task of the China Defense League was to raise funds on an international basis to carry out medical work, childcare work, and to establish industrial cooperatives. At that time, it emphasized sending the funds and materials raised to the revolutionary army led by the Chinese Communist Party – the Eighth Route Army – and to the liberated areas behind enemy lines. For example, the China Defense League introduced the Canadian doctor Norman Bethune to serve in the liberated areas. Dr. Bethune even gave his life in building the first International Peace Hospital.

    Transporting supplies to the guerrillas who persisted in resisting the war behind enemy lines was not an easy task. Even in the early days, the Kuomintang ridiculed the term "united front." In 1941, the Kuomintang even confiscated a batch of urgently needed medicines destined for Yan'an near Xi'an. Despite serious protests from many people in China, as well as foreign donors and friends, it was of no avail. When some eyewitnesses reported that the soldiers in the liberated areas had very good medical work, the Kuomintang also threatened people to silence them. Even so, the China Defense League continued to support the liberated areas until Madame Sun left Hong Kong on the last plane.

    The Second Period

    The second period of the Welfare Fund extended from Madame Sun's arrival in Chongqing to the repatriation to Shanghai after the war in November 1945.

    During this period, the task of the China Defense League was the same as in the previous period, namely, to support the soldiers in the liberated areas and border regions in resisting the aggression of Japanese imperialism. However, because Chongqing was then almost completely isolated from the outside world, the China Defense League had far fewer opportunities to promote its work internationally. Due to Madame Sun's international status and the fact that she kept complete records of the handling of funds and materials, the China Defense League was able to present the concrete needs of the people behind enemy lines – the guerrillas – who were persisting in the War of Resistance to the international community. At the same time, in order to complete the work, it was necessary to strive to transport a reasonable portion of the funds and materials raised to the liberated areas, because the fundraising organizations at that time, such as the United China Relief of the United States and the British United Aid to China Fund, were very closely related to the Kuomintang. Therefore, donations to the liberated areas could never be equal to the needs, contributions, and population percentage of the region. In this struggle, the China Defense League constantly had to defeat defamatory remarks from reactionaries at home and abroad, who argued that donations should not be sent to the liberated areas. In 1944, the Kuomintang allowed some foreign journalists to go to Yan'an. As a result, the Kuomintang's lies were refuted, because the International Peace Hospital, nurseries, and other projects run in Yan'an using relief funds and materials were open to visitors and had achieved amazing results.

    During this period, the China Defense League seized every opportunity to carry out its work. It regularly launched fundraising campaigns to meet urgent needs, such as the relief effort for the Henan famine in 1944. As a result, large amounts of funds poured into the region. While the Kuomintang even corrupted the relief efforts and allowed many people to starve to death, the China Defense League carried out practical work in this way.

    The Third Period

    In November 1945, Madame Sun returned to Shanghai, and the China Defense League began its third period. This period lasted until the liberation of Shanghai on May 27, 1949.

    The first thing Madame Sun did after returning to Shanghai was to announce the continuation of the cause she had been running. The name of the China Defense League was changed to the China Welfare Fund. At the same time, she also announced the organization's vision, which would be expanded and developed, and would be devoted to the work of recovery and construction from the wounds of war. At that time, the China Welfare Fund's plans were as follows:

    (1) International Peace Hospital and Medical College work (all in the border regions and liberated areas)
    (2) Ten nurseries and orphanages (also in the border regions)
    (3) Assistance to poor and sick writers (in Shanghai, Chongqing, Kunming, and Chengdu)
    (4) Experimental farms and pharmaceutical factories (in the border regions)

    After July 1946, the Shanghai children's work and children's theater work were added to this plan. The newly added work included literacy work in the factory areas and slums of Shanghai, and was closely linked to medical care and public health education. In addition, through the children's theater, culture was spread to those without culture, enabling them to establish their own culture. This work was also carried out on a popular basis.

    These two tasks require additional explanation. They had a dual mission. The first task was to cover up the China Welfare Fund's work in the liberated areas. The Kuomintang's political oppression and its obstruction of all work beneficial to the people of the liberated areas forced the China Welfare Fund to show that it was serving the people indiscriminately. In fact, at that time, our work focused on the liberated areas. But in 1946, when the Political Consultative Conference broke down, the US-backed Chiang Kai-shek's civil war was launched on a large scale, and the political situation in Shanghai became even more unfavorable to the China Welfare Fund, it needed to concretely prove that its policies and guidelines were without regional distinctions. This cover allowed the China Welfare Fund to continue to serve the people of the liberated areas. This explanation does not mean that the Shanghai Children's Work Group and the Children's Theater's work were unnecessary. The work itself was also important. So the second task was to launch service work for the poor children in Shanghai. Because during the Kuomintang's rule, poor children had no opportunity to go to school. Because they lacked educational opportunities, education work was very necessary. At the same time, because the poor people had almost never heard of medical treatment, medical work was also urgently needed. In addition, organizing these poor children and their families was also very important work. Through the medium of literacy classes and mass medical work, the China Welfare Fund created some conditions for organizing urban poor people and preparing for the arrival of the new China. In literacy education, Mr. Tao Xingzhi's "small teacher" system of "immediate knowledge and immediate dissemination" was adopted. This work was carried out in accordance with the needs of the city, and leadership and organizational work were emphasized among the educated children. In our children's libraries, young children gained real knowledge. Here, they discussed current events, conducted criticism and self-criticism, and established their own reading groups. On the other hand, the Children's Theater used art forms – songs, dances, and dramas – to express the people's thoughts and demands. Long before liberation, this group exposed the evils of society at that time to a wide audience, and also showed that as long as the people were united, they had the power to overcome these evils.

    However, these children's welfare activities were not limited to Shanghai. Through cooperation with an American donor organization called the China War Relief Children's Fund, the China Welfare Fund became the China representative of the China War Relief Children's Fund. Therefore, the China Welfare Fund was able to expand its work. In the work of the Relief Children's Fund, it supported 5,000 children nationwide through more than 30 institutions or groups. Before liberation, the targets of assistance from the Relief Children's Fund were progressive or potentially progressive groups. At that time, these schools or children's institutions had few other sources of funding. Through the assistance of the Relief Children's Fund, they were able to get through this extremely difficult period.

    This is the work that the China Welfare Fund completed under the Kuomintang reactionaries' gradually increasing pressure. In fact, when Shanghai was approaching liberation and facing the Kuomintang's most brutal period, the China Welfare Fund had to reduce its activities, but at the same time, we had to organize and lead the people well to cope with unexpected events. Therefore, we became part of the Shanghai Provisional United Relief Association, and our Children's Theater became a cultural work unit, using songs and dances to encourage the masses and welcome liberation.

    The Fourth Period

    The fourth period of the China Welfare Fund's development began with the liberation of Shanghai and continues to the present.

    Like other people's organizations, the environment in which the China Welfare Fund found itself after liberation was completely conducive to serving the people and was completely free from oppression. Therefore, we entered into a state of excited work. May 27 was a brand new day for Shanghai. From that day on, we entered a new environment and used all the conveniences that the new environment gave us to carry out our work.

    In the past, the staff of the China Welfare Fund often felt that they were working in isolation. Now, what lies before them is endless work and countless collaborators. Our working principle is to cooperate with government policies and to work jointly with relevant institutions. Our scope of work has expanded, and our work goals are also clear. Our tasks in the new China are even greater. So we formulated a work plan, and after proper preparations, we are now gradually realizing them.

    At this time, all the work of the China Welfare Fund is to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. We held children's summer camps and provided collective training to more than 100 "small teachers" from the workers' districts of Shanghai, improving their political standards and laying the foundation for the establishment of the Shanghai Young Pioneers at that time. We run a nursery that can accommodate 200 children, mainly serving the children of cadres. We have reorganized the Shanghai Children's Work Group, and the focus of the plan is to improve the cultural standards of the children of workers and poor people through collective activities. The Children's Theater has been expanded in order to create experience and set an example for this future children's cultural and educational work, which will develop nationwide. Under the policies of the People's Government, the Children's Relief Fund helps many children's education or care institutions to make them suitable for the needs of the New Democracy. The Relief Children's Fund also helps some schools to restore houses destroyed by the reactionaries, and in some areas, it helps the local People's Government to establish organizations to take in beggars and poor children and transfer them into production. At the same time as the above work, the China Welfare Fund continues to strive to raise funds and materials for the work that originally started in the old liberated areas, such as the International Peace Hospital and other children's institutions.

    When Shanghai was just liberated, more than 50% of the staff of the China Welfare Fund participated in the work of the People's Government or joined the Southbound Work Group. We absorbed new staff. Through intensive study and criticism and self-criticism, our staff has reached a point where they have full strength and determination to continue and expand the China Welfare Fund's consistent purpose of serving the Chinese people.

    The colleagues of the China Welfare Fund feel that in addition to the work mentioned above, they can continue to devote themselves to international propaganda work. Therefore, we would like to present some opinions to the conference in this regard:

    In recent weeks, we have seen that the US State Department is constantly using the issue of relief as one of the means to attack the new China. It is attempting to deceive the people of the world once again. They want to make people believe that the Chinese People's Government has no way to solve the food problem. At the same time, Acheson and his lackeys are deliberately trying to force people to think that the Chinese government is refusing to accept aid to disaster victims.

    Originally, the specific reports issued by the Chinese news agencies have shown that the government and the people are working hard to relieve the disaster, to stop the disaster from developing and then gradually reduce it, and have taken many effective measures to solve the food problem. However, the general public in the imperialist countries cannot obtain these reports, or these reports are all distorted, and what they get are all lies.

    The malicious rumors about the disaster relief work are not enough to surprise us. We have long expected them to do so. But we must grasp the following facts:

    The general public in the imperialist countries such as the United States and Britain often know very little about China and the Chinese people, or even have wrong concepts about us. The number of people who really understand us is not large. This is precisely because the imperialist governments and their affiliates have deliberately obscured the news, distorted the facts, and used relief work for propaganda for many years. When they talk about China, they always describe China as "poor, hungry, and hopeless." When they give us a bowl of rice with a charitable attitude, they want to force us to thank imperialism. They are trying to make people despise the strength of the Chinese people to regenerate themselves. They have been cultivating a dependence on charitable relief. Those relief organizations with imperialist backgrounds want us to be grateful for today's gifts, but never help us strive for tomorrow. Therefore, we feel that this kind of imperialist relief work must be uprooted. We must change the views of foreigners on us, and we must educate them. We should provide them with accurate and detailed information to illustrate the confidence, courage and outstanding achievements of our government and people in overcoming difficulties. We should tell them how the nature of the relief work has changed essentially under the leadership of the People's Government, how to carry out production for self-relief on the basis of the broad masses of the people, how to carry out thrift and mutual assistance with collective strength, and how the Chinese people, under correct leadership, transform the environment, overcome disasters, and make life move toward peace and abundance.

    Then we want to tell them that the Chinese people's struggle from healing the wounds of war to victory is closely linked to the struggle of the proletariat and democratic forces in the capitalist countries to defeat fascism. We should show them the unity of the Chinese people, and then constitute the great unity of progressives all over the world. We will support their struggle through this honest and effective propaganda campaign, so that this struggle will converge into the climax of the world peace movement.

    In order to achieve this combat-oriented education and propaganda mission, many methods can be adopted, such as through official reports and news reports of the government, but also through informal methods such as reporting work through people-to-people relations, and the latter is more easily accepted by the people in the imperialist countries.

    Therefore, the China Welfare Fund is willing to continue its work and strive for national and world peace. This is exactly the work we have continued for twelve years since the establishment of the first International Peace Hospital. But when the arrogant warmongers are threatening mankind with atomic bombs or superbombs, this work is even more important. We are willing to take on this work and hope that the representative conference will assign us this task and let us convey the true situation of China to the people all over the world.

    In the forthcoming National People's Relief Association and the many tasks to be resolved by this representative conference, we believe that international propaganda will be an important task. This task is to let foreign people know, through relief methods, how the Chinese people are moving towards the road of building a new China with the determination of self-reliance, and a strong new democratic China is an important guarantee for world peace. Our job is to bring this message to every corner of the earth!

　　中国福利基金会工作的报告
     ——一九五○年四月二十五日在中国人民救济代表会议上
    中国福利基金会，自开办以来，便是一个人民的团体，它的创办人和领导者，中央人民政府宋庆龄副主席，很久以来，便是和英勇斗争的中国人民联在一起的。因此，中国福利基金会，在它向全世界的呼吁中，便把中国人民为消灭封建势力、帝国主义和官僚资本主义的斗争作为它的中心课题。并且一向设法使世界其他国家的人民的斗争与中国人民的斗争互相联系起来，事实上中国福利基金会一直对这个斗争起着帮助和推动的作用。
    第一个时期
    中国福利基金会的历史，可以分为四个时期。第一个时期自一九三八年六月在香港创立之日起至一九四一年十二月八日日本帝国主义占领香港止。
    在这一时期本组织之名称叫做保卫中国大同盟，它的主要工作为支援抗战，并为联合战线之一部分。保卫中国大同盟中心任务，为在国际基础上，筹募款项，进行医药工作、儿童保育工作，与成立工业合作社等活动。它当时强调将筹得之款项及物资送往中国共产党所领导的革命军队——八路军和所解放的敌后地区去。例如，保卫中国大同盟曾介绍加拿大人白求恩大夫前往解放区服务；白求恩大夫竟至在建设第一个国际和平医院时，呈献了他的性命。
    给坚持敌后抗战的游击队运送物资，不是一件容易的事。即使在早期，国民党对于“联合战线”字样，都加以嘲笑。在一九四一年国民党甚至于在西安附近，曾经没收了一批运往延安迫切需要的药品，尽管中国有许多人士，以及国外捐赠人，国外友人提出严重的抗议仍属无效。当一些亲眼看到的人报告出解放区战士已有很好的医药工作时，国民党也曾经威胁人们，使人们沉默。纵然如此，保卫中国大同盟却一直在支持着解放区，直到孙夫人乘最后的一架飞机，离开香港。
    第二个时期
    福利基金会的第二个时期，自孙夫人抵达重庆至战后一九四五年十一月复员到上海为止。
    在这一时期，保卫中国大同盟的任务，与前一时期相同，即支援解放区及边区战士，抵抗日本帝国主义的侵略。然而，由于重庆当时已与外界近于隔绝状态，使得保卫中国大同盟在国际间推进工作的机会大为减少。由于孙夫人的国际地位，由于孙夫人处理款项及物资有完整的纪录，保卫中国大同盟，得以有机会向国际间陈述坚持抗日工作的敌后人民——游击队的具体需要。同时为了完成工作，还要把筹得之款物尽量争取把合理的部分运往解放区，因为当时筹募款物机关，如美国的援华救济会和英国的援华会，与国民党的关系都很密切。因此，对解放区的捐助，永不能与该区人民的需要、贡献和人口的百分比相等。在这个斗争中，保卫中国大同盟经常要击败一些从国内外反动派所发出的毁谤言论。这些反动派主张捐款不要送到解放区去。一九四四年国民党允许了一些外国记者到延安去。结果国民党的谎言被驳斥了。因为在延安运用救济款物所举办的国际和平医院、托儿所与其他工作，都任人参观，并且具有惊人的成绩。
    在这一时期，保卫中国大同盟，抓紧一切机会进行工作。它经常地发动一些工作来筹款，以应急需，例如一九四四年救济河南饥荒就是一个例子。结果大批款项，涌到这一区域里。在国民党甚至于使救济工作腐化，并让许多人饿死的时候，保卫中国大同盟就这样进行着实际的工作。
    第三个时期
    一九四五年十一月孙夫人返抵上海，保卫中国大同盟开始了第三个时期。这一时期一直到一九四九年五月二十七日上海解放时为止。
    孙夫人返沪后的第一件事，便是宣布了继续她所主办的事业。保卫中国大同盟的名称改为中国福利基金会。同时她也宣布了这一组织的远景，它将扩大与发展，它将致力于遭受战争创伤的恢复与建设工作。那时中国福利基金会所作的计划如下：
    （一）国际和平医院与医学院工作（全在边区与解放区）
    （二）十个托儿所与孤儿院工作（也在边区进行）
    （三）援助贫病作家（在上海、重庆、昆明、成都进行）
    （四）实验农场与制药厂工作（在边区）
    一九四六年七月后，这一计划又增加了上海儿童工作与儿童剧团工作。在新增加的工作中，包括上海工厂区与贫民区的扫除文盲工作，并密切联系着医药保健及公共卫生教育工作。此外，透过儿童剧团，把文化传播给没有文化的人，使他们建立自己的文化，这一工作，也是在普及的基础上进行的。
    这两项工作还需要另外的说明，他们是有着双重任务的，第一个任务，他们必须掩护中国福利基金会对解放区的工作。国民党的政治压迫和它对于一切有益于解放区人民工作的阻难，使中国福利基金会不得不表示它本身是毫无区别地为人民服务。实际上在那一时期我们工作是着重于解放区的。但是一九四六年，政治协商会议破裂，美帝援蒋的内战，大规模展开，上海的政治情况更加不利于中国福利基金会的时候，它更需要具体地证明它的政策与方针是毫无地区的分别的，由于这种掩护使中国福利基金会得以继续为解放区人民服务。这样的说明，并不意味着上海儿童工作组与儿童剧团的工作是不需要的。这工作的本身也有它的重要性。所以第二个任务便是对上海穷苦儿童，展开服务工作。因为在国民党统治时期，穷苦儿童是没有机会入学的，由于他们缺乏受教育的机会，因而教育工作是非常需要的。同时由于穷苦的人民几乎没有听到过医药治疗是怎样一回事，因而医药工作也是急需的，此外组织这些贫苦的孩子，和他们的家属也是很重要的工作。由于识字班与群众医药工作的媒介，中国福利基金会为组织城市贫民与迎接新中国的准备工作创造了一些条件。在识字教育方面，采用了陶行知先生的即知即传的小先生制，这一工作在进行时，适应着城市的需要，并且在受教育的少年儿童中，注重领导及组织工作，在我们的儿童图书馆里，少年儿童们获得真的知识，他们在这里讨论时事，进行批评和自我批评，成立自己的读书会。在另一方面，儿童剧团用艺术的形式——歌曲，舞蹈与戏剧——表达了人民的思想和要求。远在解放之前，这一个团体曾经向广大的观众，暴露了当时社会的罪恶，并且也表示了只要团结，人民是有力量克服这些罪恶的。
    但是这些儿童福利活动并不限于上海一地，通过与美国一个捐款机构叫做战灾儿童义养会的合作，中国福利基金会成了战灾儿童义养会的中国代表，因此中国福利基金会得以扩展它的工作，在义养会的工作中在全国通过三十几个机构或团体支持了五千个孩子。在解放以前义养会帮助的对象是进步的或可能进步的团体，当时这些学校或儿童机构很少有旁的经费来源，通过了义养会的帮助它们才得以渡过了这个极度困难的时期。
    这些便是在国民党反动派逐渐增加的压力下，中国福利基金会所完成的工作。事实上，当上海临近解放，并且面对着国民党的最残暴的时候，中国福利基金会必须缩小活动，但同时我们还要好好地组织和领导人民应付意外。因此我们变成了上海临时联合救济会的一部分，而我们的儿童剧团，便成了一个文化工作的单位，用歌曲和舞蹈来鼓舞群众，迎接解放。
    第四个时期
    中国福利基金会发展的第四个时期，从上海解放开始至现在为止。
    像其他的人民团体一样，中国福利基金会在解放后所处的环境，是完全有利于为人民服务的，而且完全免除了压迫，因此我们进入兴奋的工作情绪中。五月二十七日对上海是一个崭新的日子，从这个日子以后，我们便进入一个新环境。并且运用新环境给我们的一切便利来开展工作。
    在从前中国福利基金会的工作人员，常感到是在孤独的工作着。而现在摆在他们面前的则是做不完的工作和无数的合作者。我们的工作原则便是配合政府政策并联系有关机构共同进行工作。我们的工作范围扩大了，而我们的工作目标也清楚了。我们在新中国中的任务更重大了，于是我们制订了工作计划，而在适当地准备工作之后，我们现在正逐步的实现着它们。
    这时中国福利基金会全部工作是为工农兵服务的。我们举办了儿童夏令营，对于来自上海工人区的一百多个小先生施以集体训练，提高他们政治水准，使成为当时建立上海少年先锋队的基础。我们举办一个能容纳二百个孩子的托儿所，服务的主要对象为干部的子女。我们重新组织了上海儿童工作组，计划的中心在通过集体活动来提高工人及贫民子女的文化水准，儿童剧团扩大了，以便为这个将来会在全国发展起来的富有儿童文化教育意义的工作创造经验并起示范作用。儿童义养会在人民政府的政策下帮助许多儿童教育或教养机构使他们适合于新民主主义的需要，义养会还帮助一些学校恢复被反动派毁坏了的房舍，并且在若干地区帮助当地人民政府建立组织，收容乞儿及贫苦儿童把他们转入生产中去。与以上这些工作同时，中国福利基金会仍继续努力为原来在老解放区就开始了的工作如国际和平医院及其他儿童机构等的捐募款项及物资的工作。
    当上海刚刚解放，中国福利基金会的工作人员有百分之五十以上参加人民政府工作或加入南下工作团，我们吸收了新的工作人员，通过了紧张的学习和批评与自我批评，我们的工作人员又已经达到了这样一种地步，即具有充分的力量和决心，继续并扩大中国福利基金会的一贯宗旨为中国人民服务。
    中国福利基金会的工作同人觉得除了上面提到的工作之外还可以继续致力于国际宣传工作，因此我们愿就这方面向大会陈述一点意见：
    最近几个星期来，我们已经看到美国国务院正不断的利用救济问题做为攻击新中国的手段之一。它企图再一次的欺骗世界人民，他们想使得人民相信中国人民政府没有办法解决粮食问题，同时艾奇逊和他的走狗们，更故意要迫使人们认为中国政府拒绝接受对灾民的援助。
    本来由中国新闻机构发出的具体报道都说明政府及人民正在努力救济灾荒，使灾情停止发展进而逐渐减轻，并且采取了许多有效的措施来解决粮食问题。但是帝国主义国家内的人民大众无法获得这些报道，或者这些报道全被歪曲了，而所得到的全是些谎言。
    对于救灾工作的恶意造谣并不足以使我们惊奇，我们早就预料到他们会这样作。不过我们必须掌握下面的事实：
    美英等帝国主义国家内的一般民众对中国和中国人民往往所知甚少，甚或对我们有着错误的概念，真正了解我们的人数是不多的。这正是因为多年来帝国主义的政府及其附属机构故意蒙蔽消息，歪曲事实，以及利用救济工作来进行宣传的结果。当他们谈到中国，他们总是把中国描写为“贫穷饥饿，而且是没有希望的”。当他们以慈善的姿态给我们一碗米的时候，他们要迫使我们感谢帝国主义，他们企图使人们轻视了中国人民自力更生的力量，他们一直在培养一种对慈善救济的依赖性。那些以帝国主义为背景的救济机构，要我们感谢今天的恩赐，但是从不帮助我们为明天而努力。因此我们觉得这种帝国主义式的救济工作必需连根拔掉。我们必需改变外国人士对我们的看法，必需教育他们，我们应该供给他们正确而详细的资料，来说明我们的政府和人民在克服困难时所表现的自信、勇气和卓越的成绩。我们应该告诉他们在人民政府的领导之下救济工作如何起了本质的变化，如何在广大的群众力量上进行生产自救，如何以集体力量进行节约互助，告诉他们中国人民如何在正确的领导之下改造环境、战胜灾荒而使生活走向和平与丰富。
    接着我们要告诉他们，中国人民从医治战争创伤走向胜利的斗争，与各资本主义国家的无产阶级和民主力量战胜法西斯化的斗争是有着密切联系的。我们应该向他们显示中国人民的团结，进而构成全世界进步人士的大团结。我们将通过这种正直而有效的宣传运动来支持他们的斗争，使这个斗争汇合成世界和平运动的高潮。
    为了达成这个战斗性的教育与宣传的任务，可以采取很多方式，如通过政府的正式报告及新闻报道，但也可以采取非正式的方法如通过人民间关系来进行报道工作，而后者更容易被帝国主义国家内的人民接受。
    因此中国福利基金会愿意继续它的工作为国家及世界和平而努力。这正是我们从创立第一次国际和平医院以来已继续了十二年的工作。但是当狂妄的战争贩子们正以原子弹或超级炸弹威胁人类时，这一工作更显示重要性，我们愿意担任这个工作并希望代表会议分给我们这个任务让我们把中国真实的情况传达给全世界的人民。
    在即将产生的全国人民救济总会和这次代表大会即将决议的许多任务中，我们认为国际宣传将是一件重要工作。这件工作就是要通过救济方式使国外人士晓得中国人民怎样在自力更生的决心中向建设新中国的大道迈进，而一个强盛的新民主主义的中国是争取世界和平的重要保证。我们的工作，就是要把这个消息带到地球的每个角落里去！
