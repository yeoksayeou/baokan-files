　　“To Our Leader Chairman Mao”
     ——A Letter from a Railway Worker to Chairman Mao After a Grievance Meeting

To the Editor:
    I am a railway worker currently studying at the Municipal Party Committee Training Class. Before liberation, such a thing never happened. Now, our school's curriculum has reached the grievance meeting stage, and the meetings are over. We are all happy in our hearts, but we cannot forget Chairman Mao. I am now writing a letter to Chairman Mao.

A Letter to Our Leader Chairman Mao

Dear Chairman Mao:

    In the Beijing Municipal Party Committee Training Class under your banner, a grievance meeting has been held. During the meeting, every comrade mentioned your great, ocean-deep affection. We know that you undertook arduous struggles on the snowy mountains and grasslands to liberate the oppressed people of the whole country. We appreciate your great feelings. Now, in our school, we are again expressing our grievances before you, combining our suffering into strength to fight against all reactionary forces. In the past, we suffered because we did not have your leadership and were subjected to the heavy oppression and exploitation of the three great enemies. We know that your eyes have long been on us. Now, under your education, we are recounting the hardships of the past, and we are very happy now. We all request to meet you, and the school has replied that we can meet you on our own great festival, May Day. So, we will wait for May Day to meet you in Tiananmen Square! We will go there to greet the great Chairman Mao!

Long Live the Great Festival of the Workers, May Day!

    Han Tinghui

Editor's Note: This letter was received relatively late, and the editor's processing of this manuscript was also not timely, so Comrade Han Tinghui's letter was not seen by Chairman Mao at an earlier date. This is a shortcoming in our work, and we should pay attention to correcting it in the future.

　　“给我们的领袖毛主席”
     ——一个铁路工人在诉苦大会后给毛主席的信编辑同志：
    我是一个铁路工人，现在在市委干训班学习，在解放前，从来是没有这样事的。现在我们学校里学习课程进行到诉苦大会，已经开完会了，我们心中都快乐，可是我们不能忘掉毛主席，我现在给毛主席的一封信。
    给我们的领袖毛主席的一封信亲爱的毛主席：
    在你旗帜下的北京市委干训班，现在进行了诉苦会，在会上每个同志都念着你的伟大的海样深的感情。过去你在那雪山草地上作艰苦斗争，我们知道你是为了全国被压迫的人民得到解放。我们是体会到你的伟大心情。现在我们学校里又在你的面前诉苦，把我们的苦合在一起变成力量，去跟一切反动势力作斗争。我们过去受苦，是因为得不到你的领导，受了三大敌人的重重压迫与剥削，我们知道你的眼早就看着我们。我们现在，在你的教育下进行诉说过去的苦难，我们现在可是很快乐了。我们大家要求见见你的面，经校部答复说，在我们自己伟大的节日五一节，能和你见面。所以我们就等五一，到天安门广场和你见面吧！到那里迎候伟大的毛主席！
    工人的伟大节日五一万岁！
    韩庭会
    编者按：这封信因收到较迟，编者处理此稿，亦欠及时，使韩庭会同志的信未能早日为毛主席看到。这是我们工作中的缺点，以后当注意改正。
