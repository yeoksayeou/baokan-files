Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd: After private small handicraft industries in Nanjing organized joint operations, they have gradually expanded sales due to improved product quality. In the past, due to sluggish sales, some industries competed with each other by lowering quality and reducing prices, resulting in lower quality and fewer sales. In response to this situation, the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce proposed a joint operation approach. Since February of this year, 165 cotton weaving businesses, 20 knitting businesses, and seven small soap factories, including Xinhua and Dalu, have formed joint operation offices. The textile industry joint operation office has also divided into groups and organized a finished product research committee to be responsible for inspecting and reforming finished products. In addition to stipulating unified quality standards, the joint soap factory also solicits consumers' opinions in a timely manner. As a result, the quality of general products has improved significantly. For example, in the soap industry, the yield was previously 6.5 boxes of soap per 100 catties of oil, but now it has been changed to 5.7 boxes, and the foam and hardness have increased, so sales have gradually increased. Twenty-nine consumer cooperatives have now begun to sell or purchase their finished products.

　　南京私营小型手工业组织联营后打开销路
    【新华社南京二十三日电】南京市私营小型手工业组织联营后，由于产品质量提高，已逐步打开销路。过去由于产品销路不畅，某些行业曾以降低品质，减低价格来互相竞争，结果使品质愈低，销路愈少。市工商局针对此种情况提出了联营的办法。自今年二月份开始，先后已有棉织业一百六十五家、针织业二十家及新华、大陆等七家小型肥皂工厂，分别组成联营处。纺织业联营处并划分小组，组织成品研究委员会，负责成品的检查与改革。肥皂联合工厂除规定统一的品格外，还及时征求消费者的意见。因此一般的产品质量都大有改进。如肥皂业过去每百斤油制皂六箱半，现则改为五点七箱，泡沫与硬度均有增加，销路因此亦日渐推广，现已有二十九个消费合作社开始代销或购买其成品。
