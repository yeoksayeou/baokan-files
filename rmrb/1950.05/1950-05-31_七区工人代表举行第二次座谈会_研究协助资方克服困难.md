　　Seventh District Workers' Representatives Hold Second Symposium
     Researching Assistance to Capitalists in Overcoming Difficulties
    [From our newspaper] The worker representatives of the Seventh District People's Representative Conference, based on the opinions already received, held a second symposium on May 25 to exchange views on how to assist capitalists in overcoming difficulties and developing production. Among the opinions received, some workers raised the issue of capitalists being uneasy about management and wanting to withdraw capital. Zang Baoshan, the worker representative from Yuhua Xing, said, "We can study why those people want to close down? Is it completely impossible?" Zhang Huamin, the worker representative from Jingwei Factory, said, "Looking at the current situation, industrial and commercial enterprises with no future should change their line of business. Industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood also have difficulties. But under the leadership of the Communist Party, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. At one time, the owner of Jingwei Factory felt there was no way out and hid. Our workers came up with an idea, found the capitalist, and established a labor-capital consultation meeting, appropriately lowering wages, and actively formulating a production plan to improve output and quality. Recently, not a single piece of cloth that our factory handed over to the trade company was returned. Now the factory's situation has improved." In the end, everyone unanimously believed that under today's circumstances, the working class should, in accordance with the policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital, actively unite with the capitalists and work together to overcome temporary difficulties. Establishing a labor-capital consultation meeting is an effective method. (Seventh District Federation of Trade Unions Correspondence Group)

　　七区工人代表举行第二次座谈会
     研究协助资方克服困难
    【本报讯】第七区各界人民代表会议的工人代表，根据目前已收到的意见，于五月二十五日召开第二次座谈会，就如何协助资本家，克服困难，发展生产的问题交换意见：在已收到的意见中，有些工人提出资方不安心经营，想往外抽资本的问题。裕华兴工人代表臧宝山说：“咱们可以研究一下那些人他为什么想关门？是不是完全没有办法呢？”经纬工厂工人代表张化民说：“照今天的情况看，没有前途的工商业，应该转业。有利于国计民生的工商业，也是有困难的。但是在共产党的领导下，没有不能克服的困难。经纬工厂，有一个时期，掌柜的觉得没办法，都躲了。我们工人想出主意，找到资方，成立了劳资协商会议，把工资适当地往下落；主动地订出提高产量和质量的生产计划。最近我们工厂交给贸易公司的布，一匹也没退回来。现在厂里的情况已好转了。最后大家一致认为：今天的情况下，工人阶级应本着发展生产、劳资两利的政策，主动团结资方，协力度过暂时困难。成立劳资协商会议是一个有效办法。（七区工会办事处通讯组）
