　　Zhengzhou Railway Administration
    Bridge Engineering Exceeds Plan
    [Our Zhengzhou Dispatch] The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau planned to repair 293 bridges before May 10th. By the end of the first phase of the project at the end of March, 70 bridges had been completed. Construction is underway on 172 bridges. Calculated by workload, the first phase (January, February, March) task was completed and exceeded by 11%. As of the end of March, the permanent repair projects for all bridges, lines, station equipment, and communication signals within the bureau's jurisdiction had completed 59.8% of the first phase plan. The national railway's 1950 permanent repair project plan was arranged relatively late. Most railway bureaus (except the Northeast) started construction in mid-February, and the actual construction days for the first phase of the project were only over 40 days. On average, the first phase completion rate of various bureaus nationwide was 46.8% of the total project volume, accounting for 15.8% of the total annual project volume. The construction results of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau are indeed better than other bureaus, with bridge engineering exceeding the task the most.
    The Zhengzhou Bureau governs two major trunk lines: the Longhai Railway west of Xuzhou and the Beijing-Hankou Railway south of Shijiazhuang. In the past, the damage was severe. Among the various railway bureaus, it has the most permanent repair projects. Especially for bridge engineering, almost no bridge on the Beijing-Hankou Railway is complete. If the bureau's total of more than 1,000 permanent bridges cannot be erected within a short period of time, transportation will be difficult to guarantee during the upcoming rainy season this year.
    The Ministry of Railways attaches great importance to the permanent repair project of the Zhengzhou Bureau. The Railway Engineering Corps has concentrated three detachments and a mechanical road construction team to cooperate with the bureau's work. Thanks to the joint efforts of the bureau's construction unit employees and the commanders and fighters of the Railway Engineering Corps, the above results were achieved in the first phase of the project in more than 40 days. By focusing on key projects and concentrating efforts on restoring bridges, bridge engineering exceeded the task the most, providing a strong guarantee for rainy season transportation. However, in the process of the project, there are still shortcomings such as the design work being disconnected from the site and the untimely supply of materials, resulting in rework, wasted manpower, and affecting the progress of the project.
    The bureau held an engineering meeting on the 16th of last month, in which five Soviet experts and representatives of the Railway Engineering Corps units cooperating with the bureau participated. The meeting summarized the first phase of the repair project and deployed the second phase of work. According to the second phase being the most suitable climate for construction, coupled with the fact that the unfinished parts of the first phase must be completed in the second phase, the second phase task accounts for 59% of the total annual task, and many water damage projects must be rushed. Accepting the experience of the first phase, the meeting requested that all units must strengthen cooperation and contact, and the material department and the design department should go to the site to combine with the actual situation and simplify procedures to ensure the smooth completion of the arduous engineering tasks in the second phase.

### 郑州铁路管理局  桥梁工程超计划

　　郑州铁路管理局
    桥梁工程超计划
    【本报郑州讯】郑州铁路局管内计划于五月十日以前修复的二百九十三座桥梁，截至三月底第一期工程结束时，已全部完成七十座。正在施工的有一百七十二座。如以工量折合，共完成并超过第一期（一、二、三月）任务的百分之十一。该局管内所有桥梁、线路、站场设备、通讯号志等永久性修复工程，截至三月底止，已完成第一期计划的百分之五十九点八。全国铁路一九五○年永久性修复工程计划布置较迟，各路局（东北除外），开工多在二月中旬，第一期工程实际施工日数仅四十余天。全国各局平均第一期完成工程总量的百分之四十六点八，占全年总工程量的百分之十五点八。郑州路局管内施工成绩，实较其他各局为佳，其中桥梁工程是超过任务最多的。
    郑州局管内所辖陇海路徐州以西与京汉路石家庄以南的两条大干线，过去破坏很重，在各路局中它的永久性修复工程最多，尤以桥梁工程，京汉路桥梁几乎没有一座完整的，如果短期内不能把全局共计一千多孔永久性桥梁架好，今年即将到来的雨季中，交通就很难保证。
    铁道部对郑州局的永久性修复工程很重视，铁道兵团集中了三个支队一个机械筑路队配合该局工作。由于该局各施工单位员工，铁道兵团指战员们协同努力，第一期工程在四十多天中获得了以上的成绩；由于抓住了工程重点，集中力量恢复桥梁，故桥梁工程超过任务最多，对雨季交通也提供了有力的保证。但在工程进行中，仍存有设计工作和现场脱节及材料供应不及时等缺点，以致发生翻工浪费人力及影响工程进展等现象。
    该局于上月十六日召开工程会议，苏联专家五人及配合该局工作的铁道兵团各单位代表均参加。会议总结了第一期修复工程，并布置第二期工作。按第二期为最适合建筑的气候，加之第一期未完成部分须在二期完成，故第二期任务占全年总任务的百分之五十九，且有很多水害工程必须赶工。接受第一期的经验，会议要求各单位必须加强配合联系，材料部门与设计部门应到现场与实际结合简化手续等，以保证第二期艰巨工程任务得以顺利完成。
