The Story of Learning from the Masses
　　Professor Rizhemeihofu's Self-Narration Zhao Guoguang Records

　　My father was a blacksmith, and my grandfather was a carpenter. At the age of fourteen, I apprenticed in an iron factory.

　　The October Revolution opened a new path for me. I joined the Red Guards and became a party member a few months later, doing political work in the army.

　　At that time, we fought and studied at the same time. The Party often taught us to learn from the masses. I would like to tell a story about how I learned from the masses:

　　In 1919, the Party committee sent me to be the political commissar of a regiment. I was only seventeen years old at the time. Situations like mine were very common at that time. Because the front lines desperately needed personnel, and only we in the working class were the most reliable and resolutely revolutionary.

　　One day, the division headquarters called me in. They only said to me, "The regiment you are going to should pay attention to one problem - the commander is a former officer." And gave no other instructions. There wasn't a single party member in that regiment, and I didn't understand military affairs, and knew very little about politics. At that time, my mood was extremely low!

　　At that time, the situation was very tense, and landlords and rich peasants were plotting rebellions everywhere. It had to be done.

　　Indeed, the commander of the regiment I went to was a former officer, and he looked quite sinister. As soon as we met, he said to me, "Couldn't the Bolsheviks send another capable person besides you?" I didn't spare him: "It's none of your business." But in my heart I thought, "This little lamb has fallen into the tiger's mouth, it won't be easy to climb out."

　　After my luggage was settled, I felt very stuffy in the room, so I went to the small street to get some air. As soon as I went out the door, four soldiers were sitting there. I had a casual chat with them, and we talked very congenially. They were all lower-ranking officers, platoon leaders, and squad leaders in the army. (In the past, in the Tsarist army, the main people who taught how to fight were the squad and platoon leaders.) According to class origin, these four people were all good, one was a worker, and three were poor and lower-middle peasants. I told them the depression in my heart, and they sincerely said, "Don't be afraid of that old guy, we will solve any difficulties for you."

　　In this way, I secretly established my "illegal staff headquarters," on the one hand learning to recognize military maps and various strategies and tactics from them, and on the other hand further establishing my peripheral organization.

　　Three weeks later. The division headquarters sent an order, transferring my regiment to assist a Red Army unit that was resisting the Cossack offensive. Of course, the order had to go through the political commissar before the commander could know about it. After receiving the order, I immediately convened a meeting of my "illegal staff headquarters." At this meeting, they told me when to depart, how to send out sentries, etc.

　　Later, the order was shown to the commander, and he immediately convened a military meeting at the battalion level. When I finished reading the order and asked them to express their opinions, the meeting was silent for a long time. That cunning commander gave me a problem, he said: "Would Comrade Political Commissar please express his opinion first?" Of course, he was thinking in his heart: "Could this kid say anything?"

　　I stood up, and it was indeed a bit flustered the first time I did this, but I still repeated the words of my "illegal staff headquarters" personnel in a very affirmative tone. When I started speaking, the old guy's mouth was open in a smile, but after I finished speaking! His mouth closed tightly, and he immediately changed his attitude towards me. The entire meeting became serious. Finally, the old guy announced: "Comrade Political Commissar's opinion is completely correct."

　　About a month and a half later, the commander was injured, and I went to the hospital to see him as a colleague. He lay on the sickbed and said, "I really didn't expect you to have such great ability." I had fought with him for a long time and established a deep relationship, so I told him the whole truth.

　　向群众学习的故事
    日梅霍夫教授自述  赵国光记
    我父亲是一个铁匠，祖父是一个木匠。十四岁时，我在一个铁工厂学徒。
    十月革命给我开辟了一条新的道路，我参加了红色近卫军，几个月后入党，在军队中做政治工作。
    当时，我们一面打仗，一面学习。党常常教导我们向群众学习。我想趁此讲一个我向群众学习的故事：
    一九一九年，党委派我去做一个团的政委，那时我才十七岁。当时像我这样的情形是很多的。因为前线大批的需要着工作人员，又只有我们工人阶级最可靠，革命最坚决。
    一天，师部把我叫去，他们除了对我说：“你去的那一个团要注意一个问题——指挥官是个旧军人。”就再没有别的指示了。那个团里没有一个党员，我自己不懂军事，政治又懂得很少。那时，我情绪低极了！
    当时，局势很紧张，地主、富农到处阴谋叛变，非干不可。
    的确，我去的那个团，团长是个旧军官，样子挺阴险。一见面就对我说：“除了你之外，布尔塞维克就不能再派出另外一个能干的人来吗？”我可没有饶他：“你管不着。”但心里想：“这下小绵羊掉进了老虎口，不容易爬起来了。”
    行李放妥后，觉得屋里很闷，到小街上去透透空气。一出门，屋门那边坐着四个大兵，与他们闲谈，谈得很投机，他们都是军队里的下级军官排长、班长。（过去沙皇军队里教打仗的主要是班、排长的事。）按阶级出身，这四个人都很好，一个是工人，三个是贫雇农。我向他们说出了我心中的苦闷，他们就很诚恳的说：“不要怕那个老家伙，有困难我们为你解决。”
    就这样，我悄悄地建立了我的“非法参谋部”，一面向他们学习认识军事地图和各种战略战术，一面更加建立了我的外围组织。
    三个星期后。师部来了命令，调我这一团去援助一只正抵抗着哥萨克进攻的红军。当然，命令是先要经过政委才让团长知道的。我得到命令后，马上召集了我的“非法参谋部”会议。在这个会上，他们把应该什么时候出发，怎样派遣前哨等等都告诉了我。
    后来，命令给团长看了，马上召集营级军事会议。当我宣读完命令，要求他们发表意见时，会场沉寂了很久，那狡猾的团长向我出难题了，他说道：“请政委同志首先发表发表意见好吗？”当然，他心里是想：“这小子还谈得出什么来吗？”
    我站了起来，第一次干这事的确是有些发慌，但我仍然用很肯定的口吻，重复了我的“非法参谋部”人员的话。在我开始说话时，老家伙的嘴是张着在笑的，等我说完之后！他的嘴闭得紧紧，马上转变了对我的态度，整个会场严肃起来。最后，老家伙宣布：“政委同志的意见，是完全正确的。”
    约莫一个半月之后，团长负了伤，我以同事的身份去医院看望他。他躺在病床上说：“我真想不到你有这大的本领。”我和他在一起打仗久了，建立了深厚的感情，我就把全部真情告诉了他。（下略）
