　　Several Political Thought Problems in Middle School Geography Textbooks
    Jin Canran

    Currently, most middle school geography textbooks used across the country are old editions published by private bookstores in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Although some middle school geography textbooks were published in the old liberated areas, they were too few in number and their content did not align with the situation after the national liberation, making them unsuitable for use. Therefore, last autumn, the Textbook Compilation and Examination Committee of the North China People's Government Education Department, and this spring, the Compilation and Examination Bureau of the Central People's Government Publishing Administration, both proposed lists of textbooks for reference and selection, including several editions from Commercial Press and Kaiming for middle school geography. However, in reality, although these editions have been revised by the publishers themselves after liberation, they still contain many fundamental and significant shortcomings. After a recent re-examination, the Compilation and Examination Bureau of the Publishing Administration believes that it was wrong to hastily introduce these textbooks in the past, only writing brief summaries of the errors in the "Review Opinions," for the reference of educational administrative authorities, without seriously studying and analyzing them and making the results public. This error cannot be explained away by the lack of other better editions or other reasons. We must admit that this error indicates a lack of sufficient conscientiousness and seriousness in our work, and a failure to recognize geography education as an important ideological task. Therefore, we have decided to have Comrade Jin Canran write this article for publication in "Book Review" as a self-criticism of our work. It is hoped that teachers in all regions who are using these three geography textbooks or other old geography textbooks will pay attention to the geographical viewpoints criticized in this article and use the old textbooks critically.
    Central People's Government Publishing Administration Compilation and Examination Bureau  April 30th

    Geography is a powerful weapon for conducting political and ideological education. In geography teaching, students can understand the greatness of our people and the richness of our resources; they can understand the achievements of our working people in transforming nature and overcoming nature, thereby cultivating their love for the motherland and the people, and building confidence in a new democratic society; students can learn from the struggle between the world's two major camps to recognize the ferocity and outward strength but inward weakness of imperialism, and the greatness and material strength of the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union, thereby cultivating their determination to oppose imperialism. We have not paid enough attention to the above in the past. This can be seen from our selection of the following three geography textbooks. Now, the three middle school geography textbooks will be analyzed and criticized separately on several political and ideological viewpoints. The three textbooks are: 1. "Fuxing High School National Geography" compiled by Wang Chengzhu (December 1949 revised edition) published by Commercial Press; 2. "Kaiming New Edition National Geography" compiled by Tian Shiying (February 1950, revised edition, Volumes 2 and 4); 3. "Kaiming New Edition Elementary Foreign Geography" compiled by Wei Xiyu (August 1949, Pingyi edition). Although these three textbooks were originally written before liberation, the authors and publishers did not make the necessary checks and modifications to their old publications based on the national policy and founding spirit of New China, which indicates a lack of responsibility to the people.

    I. On the Two Camps

    The countries of the world have been divided into two extremely distinct camps that do not allow for any confusion: on the one hand, the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, the aggressive camp led by U.S. imperialism. In the teaching of world geography, these two camps must be separated, and it is absolutely forbidden to list the countries of the world side by side without distinction, describing their terrain, climate, industries, etc. one by one. It is even more forbidden to mix the world's resources and products together and explain and compare them without a clear stance.

    In "Kaiming New Edition Elementary Foreign Geography," this clear distinction is not visible. First, the table of contents does not show the characteristics of the two major camps. In the Europe section, Europe is divided into five chapters: Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, Central Europe, Southern Europe, and Western Europe. What is the meaning of this chapter division other than to express the concept of regions? Second, the true situation of U.S. imperialism is not introduced. Regarding its industries (page 113), it only says that this ranks first in the world, that ranks second in the world, this is rich, and that is very prosperous, but it does not explain who exactly holds these industries, what they are used for, nor does it explain that these rankings are gradually declining, and signs of economic crisis are increasing day by day. When describing its politics (page 114), it only says that white people "have become the masters of the Americas," but it does not explain what kind of politics the United States is practicing, or what kind of country it is. Particularly erroneous is the statement on page 96: "Britain, France, and the United States are the three advanced countries of democratic politics in the modern world." May I ask, what kind of democratic politics is the so-called "modern democratic politics"? Is this kind of democratic politics still "advanced" in today's view? How much of this kind of democratic politics is still retained in imperialist countries such as the United States, Britain, and France? In several places, the book also makes one-sided and exaggerated estimates of the strength of the U.S., this paper tiger, such as on page 11 emphasizing the role of the atomic bomb in defeating Japanese imperialism, and on page 115 emphasizing the role of the United States in World War II. Third, there are also several distorted descriptions of the Soviet Union. Page 18 says: "In 1917, a revolution occurred in Russia, abolishing the imperial system and establishing the Soviet Union." This does not explain the process of the Soviet revolution (from the February Revolution to the October Revolution), nor does it explain the nature of its revolution (from a bourgeois revolution to a proletarian revolution), only saying "abolishing the imperial system and establishing the Soviet Union," which is not in accordance with historical truth. Page 78 says that during World War II, Polish territory "was divided by Germany and the Soviet Union," believing that the Soviet Union took Polish territory, which is obviously copied from imperialist slander. The part of the territory that the Soviet Union took back in Poland was originally seized from the Soviet Union by the reactionary rulers of Poland. Fourth, new democratic countries are not adequately described, and the U.S. imperialist lackeys, France, Italy, and Yugoslavia, are not properly dissected. For example, page 87 says that after Italy's "liberation, the military autocracy was abolished and a republic was rebuilt"; page 88 says that "general elections were held in 1945, and Yugoslavia was declared the Federal People's Republic"; page 97 says that France "formulated a new constitution in 1946, and the Fourth Republic was officially established." Fifth, in many places, the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain are twisted together for narration, blurring the line between enemies and friends. Page 78 says that the German "border is under the long-term occupation of the four countries' armies, the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France," without distinguishing the nature of the two types of occupation. In the general summary of the eighth chapter, agricultural products, power resources, and metal mineral products of various countries in the world are listed in a flat manner, without distinguishing which are in the hands of the Soviet Union and new democratic countries, and which are in the hands of imperialism led by the United States.

    Of course, we also know that this book was published in December 1947, and the international and domestic situation at that time was not what it is now, but we believe that even under those circumstances, some mistakes could have been avoided as long as the author had read more progressive books. What is especially unforgivable is that the edition printed in August 1949 still retains the above-mentioned political errors without any changes.

    II. On Sino-Soviet Friendship

    Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out unequivocally in "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "Based on the experience of forty years and twenty-eight years, the Chinese people either lean to the side of imperialism or lean to the side of socialism, without exception." It is a crystal clear truth that the Chinese people must lean to the side of the Soviet Union. In our geography teaching, we must strengthen students' understanding of the Soviet Union, cultivate their thoughts and feelings of friendship toward the Soviet Union, and any remarks that go against this purpose should not be tolerated.

    However, in the geography textbooks we introduced, anti-Soviet remarks that violated the established national policy still exist. This can be clearly seen in the "Fuxing High School National Geography" compiled by Wang Chengzhu. This book demonstrates obvious anti-Soviet views in the following two aspects:

    First, regarding the Northeast. On page 13 of the upper volume, in describing the Sino-Soviet agreement on Lushunkou and Dalian, it slanders the Soviet Union for infringing on China's rights, and says that "the Soviet Union's influence in the Northeast has greatly expanded." In the example exercise on page 15, it asks: "What are the shortcomings of our country's current rights and interests in the Northeast?" Page 53 of the lower volume says more explicitly: "The Northeast region protrudes in the northeast of the national border, and the two sides of the Northeast were previously surrounded by the territories of Japan and the Soviet Union. All development is particularly deeply affected by external forces. Although Japan's influence has been eliminated, the Soviet Union's influence has expanded even more." On pages 165 and 168 of the upper volume, regarding the agreement on the Sino-Soviet joint management of the China Changchun Railway, the Soviet Union is shown unfriendly spirit after words like "considered" and "but". Historical facts have irrefutably proven that the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance and other agreements signed in 1945 were beneficial to the people of China and the Soviet Union in order to deal with imperialism and the then Kuomintang reactionary group's rule in China. Based on the alliance treaty, the Soviet government directly sent troops to assist the Chinese people in defeating Japanese imperialism in the Northeast, forcing Japanese imperialism to surrender, and based on the agreement, played a role in monitoring the resurgence of Japanese imperialism in the Northeast. In the various constructions in the Northeast, the Soviet government provided great assistance in terms of manpower and materials. Based on what logic can all of this be called "expansion of influence"? Based on what logic can we equate our enemies with our friends and collectively call them the "influence of external forces"?

    Second, regarding the Mongolian People's Republic. On page 2 of the upper volume, the recognition of the independence of the Mongolian People's Republic in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance is called "unfortunate." On page 81 of the same volume, Outer Mongolia is listed alongside Taiwan, saying that "Taiwan was recovered, but Outer Mongolia's independence is probably a losing proposition." Page 175 of the same volume goes to great lengths to distort history, saying: The origin of Outer Mongolia's "independence movement was not purely out of the autonomy of the local residents; after independence, the so-called Mongolian People's Republic cannot be completely self-reliant. This situation is naturally unfavorable to our country. Moreover, the country name is not limited to Outer Mongolia, the border lacks natural barriers, and it is not easy to establish a strong national defense along the new border?" In the chapter "The Northern Desert Grassland Region" on pages 110 to 116 of the lower volume, in addition to completely denying the independence of the Mongolian People's Republic, it also distorts the truth, saying that this was "mined by the Russians" and that "completely fell into the hands of the Russians." Regarding the Tangnu Ulianghai region, it even recklessly said, "The Soviet Union has obviously obtained our country's original status here." Everyone knows that after the Soviet October Revolution, the people of Outer Mongolia, with the help and influence of the Soviet Union, drove out the foreign invaders, overthrew the oppressors of their own nation, and embarked on the road of liberation more than 20 years earlier than the people and ethnic groups in other parts of China, establishing an independent people's republic. Later, with the friendly assistance of the Soviet Union, construction work was launched. In the 20 years from 1927 to 1947, the value of industrial products increased more than a hundredfold, and the commodity production of animal husbandry increased by one time in 1940 to 1948 alone, while in the 25 years after the revolution, the cultivated area increased more than one hundred and seventy times. On the 25th anniversary of the Mongolian People's Republic, the Prime Minister of the country, Choibalsan, said in a telegram to Stalin: "The great October Revolution and the invincible Lenin-Stalin theory have opened up a bright road of freedom and happiness for the Mongolian people, and therefore our people have achieved great achievements in overcoming feudal remnants and developing the country's economy and culture in the 25 years since the establishment of the Mongolian People's Republic." It must also be added that the Mongolian People's Republic also played a glorious role in assisting the Chinese people in defeating Japanese imperialism. The independence of the Mongolian People's Republic was decided by a referendum in 1945. We should be celebrating the independence of the Mongolian People's Republic and cheering for the establishment of diplomatic relations between it and the People's Republic of China. Any distortion of the truth about the independence of the Mongolian People's Republic and the anti-Soviet and anti-Mongolian propaganda made on this basis should be met with a just counterattack.

    III. On National Equality

    China is a multi-ethnic country, and the Common Program stipulates: "All ethnic groups within the People's Republic of China are equal, practice unity and mutual assistance, oppose imperialism and the people's enemies within each ethnic group, so that the People's Republic of China becomes a big family of friendship and cooperation among all ethnic groups." In our geography teaching, we should cultivate students' correct understanding of ethnic minorities in accordance with this spirit, eliminate the remaining poison of Han chauvinism instilled in their minds by the Kuomintang reactionary rulers, and cultivate their ideological viewpoints of respecting ethnic minorities.

    In the revised edition of "Kaiming New Edition Elementary National Geography," sufficient attention has not been paid to this point. In the sections involving ethnic minorities, there is a lack of clear and correct descriptions of the production and life of ethnic minorities, and of their economic and political systems. Moreover, in several places, the tone of Han chauvinism is followed, and some contemptuous words are added to ethnic minorities.

    All ethnic minorities in China have their own glorious history. They have all fulfilled their due responsibilities in the development of Chinese culture. They have relied on their own efforts to prosper and grow on this land of China, and have made heroic struggles against the enemies of nature and society. Their cultural backwardness and difficult lives were caused by the irrational social system of the past and the feudal bureaucratic rulers of the Han people and their own ethnic groups. Judging the characteristics of a nation with "strong" or "gentle" is precisely the wrong conclusion drawn by the Han rulers based on the superficial reflections caused in the ethnic minorities by their rule over the ethnic minorities. In addition, in accordance with Articles 51 and 53 of the Common Program, the correct policy toward ethnic minorities should be explained as implementing regional autonomy or allowing ethnic minorities to have a considerable number of representatives in certain state power organs, and helping them "develop their political, economic, cultural, and educational construction undertakings."

    IV. On Geographical Environment and Population Issues

    All old geography textbooks cannot escape the influence of geographical determinism and population theory. These textbooks often look at the geographical environment and population development apart from a certain social system, and regard them as absolute and decisive. They do not understand that although the geographical environment is one of the constant and necessary conditions for social development, its influence is not immutable, and it changes with the different social life systems of a country. They do not understand that although the size of the population has some influence on social development, that influence varies with the different social systems. Each historical mode of production has its own special laws of population growth.

    The colors of geographical determinism and population theory can be clearly seen in "Kaiming New Edition Junior High School National Geography" and "Fuxing High School National Geography."

    First, let's talk about geographical determinism. In the section on Shaanxi Province in Kaiming Volume 4, there is a lesson titled "The Impact of Different Natural Environments on Residents." Under this title, it describes agriculture, minerals, industry and commerce, transportation, housing, disasters, population, and other issues, that is to say, the author uses the influence of the natural environment to explain all the economic problems of Shaanxi Province. This explanation is obviously one-sided and wrong, because it cannot explain the following series of questions: Why can the same Loess Plateau, under the people's regime led by the Communist Party, be transformed from a barren area "suffering a major drought every ten years and a minor drought every three years" to abundance and prosperity; why can the same fertile Guanzhong Plain, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, suffer from reduced cotton and wheat production and disrepair of water conservancy; why does the same Shaanxi Province have only old-fashioned transportation tools and handicraft production a hundred years ago, while in recent centuries it has developed new-style transportation tools and machine industry, although this development has been greatly restricted in the past. In the section "Floods and Droughts" on pages 178 to 180 of the upper volume of Fuxing, the occurrence of floods and droughts in North China is only explained from natural conditions, without explaining the disasters imposed on farmers by the cruel exploitation of feudal warlords, the Kuomintang reactionaries, and imperialism, and the social causes such as the disrepair of water conservancy and the untimely cultivation that inevitably occurred under their rule. Therefore, its explanation is also one-sided and loses its due educational significance. Page 121 of the middle volume of the same book uses only the four words "important location" to explain the reasons for the prosperity and development of Shanghai, which cannot explain why the same place was a remote fishing village a hundred years ago, but after the Opium War it suddenly became an "important location" and "the degree of prosperity far exceeds other major cities." There are many similar erroneous explanations as above, and they will not be listed here one by one.

    Secondly, let's talk about population theory. Regarding immigration to the Northeast, Northwest, and Southwest, both books simply explain it in terms of overpopulation. Page 120 of the upper volume of Fuxing says: "Most of the densely populated provinces have already experienced the phenomenon of overpopulation." Page 121 says that Shandong and Hebei have "difficulty accommodating their naturally increasing population," page 122 says that immigration to the Northwest provides "another way out for the surplus population of Hebei and Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces," and the same page also says that "the population density in most of the southern provinces has also reached saturation." Pages 45 to 46 of Kaiming Volume 2 also say that immigration to the Northeast "can solve the problem of overpopulation in North China." For one or two hundred years, the population in North China, East China, and Central and South China has indeed been migrating to the Northeast, Northwest, Southwest, and overseas. But is this migration due to the "overpopulation" of these areas? No, it reflects the phenomenon that under feudal and semi-colonial and semi-feudal exploitation, the working people lost their means of production, or although they still retained a small amount of means of production, they could not obtain the means of subsistence to maintain their livelihood due to excessive exploitation. The so-called "overpopulation" is caused by feudal exploitation and imperialist aggression. Once the shackles of this exploitation and aggression are broken and large-scale production and construction begin, the so-called "overpopulation" will no longer exist.

    V. On Economic Construction

    Our geography teaching should serve production and construction. National geography textbooks should provide appropriate and vivid descriptions of our country's rich material resources and how we should use these resources to engage in production and construction, so as to enhance students' understanding of production and construction and encourage their enthusiasm for construction. The two national geography textbooks we introduced have done some work in this regard, but they are not enough and have errors.

    In the upper volume of Fuxing, the descriptions of our country's important mineral deposits, agricultural products, and industries do not emphasize the shortcomings from a clear standpoint in several places. Regarding coal deposits, it says: "The wide distribution may not be enough to indicate the large reserves" (page 79). Regarding gold, silver, and copper deposits, it strives to describe their scarcity (page 81). Regarding oil and sulfur, it also says that "the reserves are particularly rare" (page 81). What is especially inappropriate is that it uses the method of comparing resources with those of U.S. imperialism, saying that our country's coal reserves are only a fraction of theirs, and iron reserves are only a fraction of theirs. Based on currently known materials, our country is not a country with scarce mineral deposits, and new local resources will be discovered one after another as large-scale production and construction are launched in the future. In geography textbooks, we should be cautious in using materials, adopt an appropriate attitude of reservation, and should have a clear standpoint when explaining. Regarding agriculture, page 149 of the same book says: "Our country is known as an agricultural country, and the difference between the current agricultural situation and other countries is that it consumes particularly much manpower, and the efficiency of general work is particularly low" (page 149). Regarding industry, it only criticizes backwardness without stating the reasons for backwardness (page 151). Discarding historical conditions and social systems, and one-sidedly and negatively criticizing our country's poverty and backwardness, what is the effect on education? It will damage the national self-esteem and self-confidence, and help the superstition of the so-called "material civilization" of U.S. imperialism across the Pacific.

    Both textbooks have discussed our country's economic construction plans, and these discussions are often inconsistent with actual circumstances, and some even contain erroneous understandings. Page 6 of Kaiming Volume 2 introduces the so-called "Yang Yu'an" plan of the U.S. imperialist "expert" Savage, saying that if that plan can be realized, how much electricity can be generated and how much farmland can be irrigated; in fact, according to the criticism of some scientists, that so-called plan is entirely for the benefit of U.S. imperialism and harms the interests of the Chinese people. Page 165 of the upper volume of Fuxing, pages 34, 35, 39, and 45 of the middle volume all mention Mr. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan, expressing that if railways and ports are built across the country according to that plan, our country's construction will have great hope. Mr. Sun Yat-sen's contribution to the Chinese revolution and his humble attitude of accepting the truth are indeed worthy of our admiration, but we must also honestly point out that many points in his industrial plan do not start from reality, and are therefore not suitable for the needs of today's great motherland's construction.

    VI. On the Selection of Materials

    Both of these national geography textbooks are not cautious enough in selecting materials. Some inherited old mistakes due to uncritical adoption of old materials, and some formed errors due to failure to replace new materials with the development of the situation.

    Page 13 of Kaiming Volume 4 says: "The Qing Taizu raised troops, and Suoyang was the first to bear the brunt. After capturing it, it was renamed Fushun." The author did not analyze that the Qing Taizu's renaming of Suoyang to Fushun contained the meaning of national aggression. Page 55 of the same book says: "Yao's capital Pingyang is now Linfen; Shun's capital Puban is now Yongji; Xia's capital Anyi is now Yuncheng." The author did not examine that the capitals of Yao, Shun, and Yu listed here all lack authenticity. Like general textbooks, this textbook records many places of historical interest, page 20 of Volume 2 records Xetao Well and Qingcheng Mountain on the outskirts of Chengdu, the Eight Diagrams Formation of Zhuge Kongming in the east of Wanxian City, page 24 records the Buddhist scenic spot of Mount Emei, page 11 of Volume 4 records the Qing Mausoleums on the outskirts of Shenyang, page 58 records the Wild Goose Pagoda, the Forest of Stone Steles, and the Afang Palace near Xi'an, etc. Some of these places of historical interest lack scientific reliability, and some contain the unhealthy atmosphere of literati "expressing their melancholy feelings about the past" in the meaning of the records. Geography textbooks can and should be linked to history, but the standard for linking should first be to help stimulate students' patriotic enthusiasm and construction enthusiasm.

    "Fuxing High School National Geography" retains many outdated materials. In the upper volume, Chapter 2 is about production, Chapter 3 is about transportation, Chapter 4 is about provincial boundaries, and page 55 of the lower volume is about the administrative divisions of the Northeast. The materials and explanations are mostly outdated. Page 177 of the upper volume has revised the position of the capital in the text, but the exercises still ask about Nanjing as the capital. In these outdated materials and explanations, what students understand is still the semi-feudal and semi-colonial China. It is impossible for them to understand the new appearance of New China and the new posture of the people's China from this geography textbook.

### 中学地理教本中的几个政治思想问题

　　中学地理教本中的几个政治思想问题
    金灿然
    现在各地中学地理教本大半是旧时在国民党统治区内各家私营书店所出版的。过去老解放区内虽出过几种中学地理教本，但分量太少，内容也与全国解放后的形势不很符合，不再适用了。因此，前华北人民政府教育部教科书编审委员会在去年秋天，中央人民政府出版总署编审局在今年春天，提出供各方参考选用的教科书书目时，在中学地理科目中，就列入了商务、开明的几种本子。但是事实上，这几种本子中虽然有在解放后由出版者自行修订过的，却仍旧包含着许多原则性的重大的缺点。在最近重新检查之后，出版总署编审局认为过去草率地介绍这几种教科书，只把书中所含的错误扼要地写在《审读意见书》里，供教育行政当局参考，没有认真的加以研究分析，将结果公之于众，是错误的。这种错误不能用没有其他较好的本子或其他理由来解释。我们应该承认，这种错误表示我们在工作上还缺乏足够的认真严肃性，没有把地理科的教学看做一个重要的思想工作。因此，我们决定由金灿然同志写成这篇文章交《图书评论》发表，作为我们的工作检讨。希望各地采用这三种地理教本或采其他旧地理教本的教师，在教学时注意这篇文章中所批评的地理观点，批判地使用旧教本。
    中央人民政府出版总署编审局  四月三十日
    地理科是进行政治思想教育的有力武器。在地理教学中，可以使学生认识我国人民的伟大与资源的丰富；可以使学生认识我国劳动人民改造自然、战胜自然的成果，从而培养他们爱祖国、爱人民的观念和建立新民主主义社会的信心；可以使学生从世界两大阵营的斗争中，认识帝国主义的凶恶和外强中干，认识以苏联为首的和平民主阵营的伟大及其物质力量，从而培养他们反对帝国主义的决心。对于以上所说的，我们过去重视得很不够。这从我们选择了以下三种地理课本可以看出。现在就把那三种中学地理教本，分别在几个政治思想观点上加以分析和批判。那三种教本是：一、王成组编商务印书馆发行的《复兴高中本国地理》（一九四九年十二月改编本），田世英编的《开明新编本国地理》（一九五○年二月二、四册修订本），韦息予编的《开明新编初级外国地理》（一九四九年八月平一版本）。这三种教本，虽然本来是在解放以前写的，但是作者和出版者没有根据新中国的国策与立国精神，将自己的旧出版物加以必要的检查修改，这就表示，对人民负责的精神是不够的。
    一  关于两个阵营
    全世界的国家已经划分成极其明显的，丝毫不容混淆的两个阵营，一方面是以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，另一方面是以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营。在世界地理的教学中，必须把这两个阵营分开，决不能不分青红皂白，把世界各个国家并列起来，一国一国的叙述他们的地势、气候、产业等等，更不能把世界的资源及物产混合起来，无立场的加以说明与比较。
    在《开明新编初级外国地理》中，看不出这种分明的界线。第一，在目次上就没有显出两大阵营的色彩。在欧罗巴洲一编中，把欧洲分为东欧、北欧、中欧、南欧、西欧五章，这种分章的办法，除了表示地区的概念以外，还有什么意义？第二，没有介绍美帝国主义的真实情况。对于它的产业（一一三页），只说这个占世界第一位，那个占世界第二位，这个丰富，那个很盛，可没有说明这些产业到底握在谁的手里，他们拿来作何用途，也没有说明这些占第一位、第二位的已经日渐衰落，经济危机袭来的迹象却日益增多。在叙述到它的政治时（一一四页），只说白人“已成美洲的主人”，可没有说明美国到底在实行着一种什么政治，它到底是一个什么性质的国家。特别错误的，九六页上说：“英法两国与美国为今世民主政治的三个先进国家。”试问，所谓《今世民主政治》是什么性质的民主政治？这种民主政治在现在看来还是“先进”的吗？在美英法等帝国主义国家内，就连这种民主政治到底还保留着多少呢？书中对于美国这个纸老虎的实力，在若干处也作了片面的夸大的估计，如一一页强调了原子弹在击败日本帝国主义时的作用，一一五页强调了美国在第二次世界大战中的作用等。第三，对于苏联还有若干歪曲的叙述。一八页说：“一九一七年，俄国发生革命，废除帝制，成立苏联。”这儿既没有说明苏联革命的过程（二月革命到十月革命），也没有说明它的革命的性质（从资产阶级革命到无产阶级革命），只说了个“废除帝制，建立苏联”，这是不合历史真实情况的。七八页说第二次世界大战中波兰国土“为德苏所瓜分”，认为苏联拿了波兰的领土，这显然是抄袭了帝国主义的谰言。苏联在波兰取回的一部分领土，本来是波兰的反动统治者从苏联侵占去的。第四，对于新民主主义国家没有加以适当的叙述，对于美帝国主义的从仆法、意、南也没有适当的解剖。如八七页说意大利“解放以后，废除军主政体，改建共和国”；八八页说“一九四五年举行大选，宣布南斯拉夫为联邦人民共和国”；九七页说法国“一九四六年制定新宪法，第四共和国正式成立”。第五，在许多地方，把苏联与英美扭在一起叙述，混淆了敌友界线。七八页说德国“国境在苏美英法四国军队分区长期占领中”，没有分清两种占领的性质。第八编综述中，把世界各国的农产、动力资源、金属矿产作了平面的罗列，分别不出那些是掌握在苏联及新民主主义国家手里，那些是掌握在以美国为首的帝国主义手里。
    当然，我们也知道这本书是在一九四七年十二月问世的，那时的国际国内情况并不是现在的样子，但是我们认为，即令在当时的情况下，只要作者能多找些进步的书籍看一看，有些错误也可以避免。尤其不能原谅的是，一九四九年八月印行的本子，依然原样不动的保留了上述的政治上的错误。
    二  关于中苏友好
    毛泽东同志在《论人民民主专政》中斩钉截铁的指出来：“积四十年和二十八年的经验，中国人民不是倒向帝国主义一边，就是倒向社会主义一边，绝无例外。”中国人民必须倒向苏联一边，已是昭如日月的真理。在我们的地理教学中，必须加强学生对苏联的认识，培养他们对苏联友好的思想与感情，任何有背于这个宗旨的言论，都是不应该有的。
    但是，在我们所介绍的地理教本中，违反既定国策的反苏言论依然存在。这在王成组编的《复兴高中本国地理》中，可以清楚的看出。这本书在以下两个方面，表现了明显的反苏观点：
    第一，关于东北。上册一三页在叙述关于旅顺口、大连的中苏协定时，诬蔑苏联侵占了中国的权利，并且说“苏联在东北的势力大为扩张”。在一五页的习题举例中，又发问道：“我国现今在东北的权益有何缺陷？”下册五三页中更露骨的说：“东北地带突出在国境的东北部，东北两边以前被日、苏两国属地包围，一切发展，受外力的影响特别深刻。现今日本的势力虽则消灭，苏联的势力更其扩张。”在上册一六五及一六八页，关于中苏共管中国长春铁路的协定，也在“算是”“但是”等字眼之后，对苏联表现了不友好的精神。历史事实已经无可置辩的证明，一九四五年所订的中苏友好条约及其他协定，为了对付帝国主义及当时国民党反动集团在中国的统治，对于中苏两国人民，都是有利的。苏联政府根据同盟条约，直接出兵援助中国人民在东北击溃了日本帝国主义，迫使日本帝国主义投降，并根据协定，在东北发挥了监视日本帝国主义再起的作用。而在东北的各项建设中，苏联政府又在人力物力上给予伟大的帮助。这一切，凭什么逻辑可以叫做“势力扩张”呢？凭什么逻辑可以把我们的敌人与我们的朋友并列起来，统称“外力的影响”呢？
    第二，关于蒙古人民共和国。上册第二页中，把中苏友好协定中承认蒙古人民共和国的独立叫做“不幸”。同册八一页中，将外蒙与台湾并列起来，说是“台湾收复而外蒙独立，恐怕得不偿失。”同册一七五页更极尽曲解历史之能事，说：外蒙“独立运动的起源，既不是纯乎出于当地居民的自动；独立之后，所谓蒙古人民共和国并不能完全自立。这种情形，自然不利于我国。何况在国名并不以外蒙为限，边界又缺乏自然的屏障，而沿着新边界又不容易建立强固的国防？”下册一一○至一一六页《漠北草原区域》一章中，除了完全否认蒙古人民共和国的独立性外，并且歪曲的说，这个“被俄人所开采”，那个“完全落到俄人手中”，对于唐努乌梁海区域，更信口开河的说，“苏联在这里已经严然取得了我国原有的地位”。大家知道，苏联十月革命之后，外蒙人民在苏联的帮助与影响之下，赶走了外国的侵略者，推翻了本民族的压迫者，较中国其他各地的人民与民族，提早二十余年走上了解放的道路，建立了独立的人民共和国。以后又在苏联的友好帮助之下，展开了建设工作。自一九二七年至一九四七年的二十年间，工业产品的价值增加了一百倍以上，单在一九四○年至一九四八年，养畜业商品生产额就增加了一倍，而在革命后的二十五年间，耕地面积就增加了一百七十余倍。在蒙古人民共和国二十五周年纪念时，该国总理乔巴山致斯大林的电文中说：“伟大的十月革命和不可战胜的列宁斯大林学说，对于蒙古人民开辟了自由与幸福的光明道路，因而我国人民，在蒙古人民共和国成立的二十五年间，在克服封建残余和发展本国经济与文化方面，达成了巨大的成就。”还必须补充说明，蒙古人民共和国在协助中国人民击败日本帝国主义中，也起了光辉的作用。蒙古人民共和国的独立，是经过一九四五年的公民投票自行决定的。我们正应该为蒙古人民共和国的独立而庆幸，为它与中华人民共和国建立了外交关系而欢呼，任何歪曲蒙古人民共和国独立的真象，并借此而作的反苏反蒙古的宣传，都应该遭到严正的反击。
    三  关于民族平等
    中国是一个多民族的国家，共同纲领中规定：“中华人民共和国境内各民族一律平等，实行团结互助，反对帝国主义和各民族内部的人民公敌，使中华人民共和国成为各民族友爱合作的大家庭。”在我们的地理教学中，应该根据这个精神，培养学生对少数民族的正确认识，消除国民党反动统治者灌输在他们思想中的大民族主义的遗毒，养成他们尊重少数民族的思想观点。
    在《开明新编初级本国地理》修订本中，对于这一点并没有加以足够的注意。在涉及少数民族的各节中，对于少数民族的生产生活情况，对于他们的经济政治制度，缺乏明白而正确的叙述。而且在若干地方，沿袭了大汉族主义的口吻，对少数民族加上一些轻蔑的词句。
    中国境内的各少数民族都有他自己的光辉的历史，他们在中国文化的发展上，都尽了一份应尽的责任，他们依靠了自己的努力，在中国这块土地上繁荣滋长，向自然及社会的敌人作了英勇的斗争。他们的文化落后，生活困苦，是过去的不合理的社会制度，汉族及本族内的封建官僚统治者所造成的。以“强悍”或“温和”来判定一个民族的特点，正是汉族统治者根据他们对少数民族的统治，在少数民族中所引起的表面反映而得来的错误结论。此外，应该按照共同纲领第五十一条及五十三条的规定，对于少数民族的正确政策，说明是实行区域自治或让少数民族在一定的政权机关中有相当名额的代表，并帮助他们“发展其政治、经济、文化、教育的建设事业”。
    四  关于地理环境与人口问题
    所有旧的地理教本都摆脱不了地理决定论与人口论的影响。这些教本中往往离开了一定的社会制度来看地理环境与人口发展，把它们看成绝对的与具有决定性的。他们不了解，地理环境虽然是社会发展的经常必要的条件之一，但它的影响并不是一成不变的，它是随着一个国家的社会生活制度的不同而改变的。他们更不了解，人口的多少虽然给社会发展以某种影响，但那种影响是随着社会制度的不同而不同的，每一种历史的生产方式都有它自己的人口生长的特殊规律。
    《开明新编初中本国地理》及《复兴高中本国地理》，都很清晰的看得出地理决定论与人口论的色彩。
    首先说地理决定论。开明第四册在陕西省一节中，有一段以“自然环境不同对居民的影响”为标题的课文，在这个标题下，叙述了农业、矿产、工商业、交通、房屋、灾荒、人口等等问题，也就是说，作者用自然环境的影响来说明了全部陕西省的经济问题。这种说明显然是片面的，错误的，因为它不能够说明以下一连串的问题：同样的一个陕北高原，为什么在共产党领导的人民政权下，一块“十年一大旱，三年一小旱”的荒旱地区可以一变而走向丰衣足食；同样的沃野千里的关中平原，为什么在反动的国民党统治之下，会闹得棉麦减产，水利失修；同样的一个陕西省，为什么一百年前只有旧式的交通工具及手工业生产，而近百年来却发展了新式交通工具与机器工业，虽然这种发展在过去曾受到很大的限制。复兴上册一七八至一八○页《水旱灾患》一节中，对于华北水旱灾荒的产生，只从自然条件来加以解释，没有从封建军阀、国民党反动派、帝国主义的残酷剥削所加于农民的灾害，及在他们统治下所必然发生的水利失修、耕种失时等等社会的原因来说明这个问题。因此，它的解释也是片面的，失掉了应有的教育意义。该书中册一二一页，对于上海繁荣发达的原因，只用“位置冲要”四个字来加以解释，这就不能够说明，为什么同样的一个地方，在一百年前还是一个荒僻的渔村，而在鸦片战争之后却忽然“位置冲要”起来，“繁荣的程度远胜其他各大城市”。类似以上的错误解释还有许多，这儿不再一一列举了。
    其次说人口论。对于向东北、西北及西南的移民，两书都是单纯的用人口过剩来解释。复兴上册一二○页说：“人口稠密的各省，大多已经发生人口过剩的现象。”一二一页说山东河北已“难以容纳他们天然继续增加的人口”，一二二页说向西北移民给“河北以及山西、陕西、甘肃等省的过剩人口另有一条出路”，同页又说“南方各省的人口密度，大部分也已经达到饱满的地步。”开明第二册四五至四六页也说向东北移民，“可以解决华北的人口过剩问题”。一二百年以来，华北、华东、华中南地区的人口确实在向东北、西北、西南以及海外移殖。但这种移殖是否由于这些地区的“人口过剩”呢？不是的，那是表现了在封建的及半殖民半封建的剥削之下，劳动人民失掉了生产手段，或者虽尚保有少量生产手段，但由于过分的剥削而不能取得维持温饱的生活资料的现象。所谓“人口过剩”，是封建剥削与帝国主义的侵略所造成的，一旦把这种剥削与侵略的锁链挣脱，大规模的生产建设开始的时候，所谓“人口过剩”就不复存在了。
    五  关于经济建设
    我们的地理教学应该为生产建设服务。本国地理教本中，应该把我国丰富的物质资源，及我们要如何利用这些资源来从事生产建设，加以恰当而生动的叙述，借以提高学生对生产建设的认识，并鼓励他们的建设热忱。我们所介绍的这两种本国地理课本中，在这方面都做了一些，但是都做得不够，而且有错误。
    复兴上册中，关于我国重要矿藏、农产、工业的叙述，在若干处都没有立场的强调了缺点。关于煤藏，说：“分布之广，未必就足以表明储量之大”（七九页），对于金、银、铜的矿藏，竭力形容其贫乏（八一页），对于石油及硫黄，也说“储量特别稀少”（八一页）。特别不应该的是，用了与美帝国主义的资源对比的办法，说我国的煤藏只抵其几分之几，铁藏只抵其几十分之几。就现在已知的材料，我国并不是一个矿藏贫乏的国家，而且将来生产建设大规模的展开以后，新的地方资源将陆续发现。在地理教本中，我们使用材料应该审慎，应该采取适当的保留态度，在说明时更应该有立场。关于农业，同书一四九页说：“我国号称以农立国，而现时农业的情形，与他国不同之点，就是消耗人工特别多，而一般工作的效率特别低。”（一四九页）关于工业又只批评了落后，并没有说出落后的原因（一五一页）。丢开了历史条件与社会制度，片面的、消极的批评我国的贫乏与落后，在教育上所引起的效果是什么呢？那将是损害民族的自尊心与自信心，而帮助对太平洋彼岸的美帝国主义的所谓“物质文明”的迷信。
    对于我国的经济建设计划，两种教本中都有所论述，这些论述往往不合实际情况，有的还包含了错误的认识。开明第二册第六页中，介绍了美帝国主义“专家”萨凡奇的所谓“扬域安”计划，说那个计划如能实现，可以发多少电力，灌溉多少农田；实则，据有些科学家的批评，那个所谓计划完全是为美帝国主义的利益作打算，危害中国人民的利益的。复兴上册一六五页，中册三四、三五、三九、四五页，都提到孙中山先生的实业计划，表示如按照那个计划在全国修铁路、筑港口，我国的建设将会大有希望。孙中山先生对中国革命的贡献及他的虚心接受真理的态度，诚然值得我们佩服，但我们也要老实的指出，他的实业计划的许多论点却不是从实际出发的，因而也就不适合于今天伟大祖国建设的需要。
    六  关于选用材料
    这两种本国地理教本在选用材料上都不够谨严，有的由于无批判的采用旧材料而承袭了旧的错误，有的由于没有随着形势的发展改换新材料而形成了错误。
    开明第四册一三页说：“清太祖起兵，锁阳首当其冲，攻下后乃易名抚顺。”作者没有分析，清太祖把锁阳易名抚顺，是含有民族侵略的意义在内的。同书五五页说：“尧都平壤，是现在的临汾；舜都蒲坂，是现在的永济；夏都安邑，是现在的运城。”作者没有考查，这儿所列举的尧、舜、禹的都城，都是缺乏真实性的。这个教本中，和一般教本一样，记载了不少的名胜古迹，第二册二○页记载了成都外围的薛涛井、青城山，万县城东的诸葛孔明八阵图，二四页记载了峨嵋山佛教胜地，第四册一一页记载了沈阳外围的清陵，五八页记载了西安附近的雁塔、碑林、阿房宫等等，这些名胜古迹有的缺乏科学的可靠性，有的在记载的意义上含有士大夫“发思古之幽情”的不健康的气息。地理教本中可以而且应该联系历史，但联系的标准首先应该是有助于激发学生的爱国热忱与建设热忱。
    《复兴高中本国地理》中保留了许多陈旧的材料。上册第二章关于生产，第三章关于交通，第四章关于省界，下册五五页关于东北的政区，材料与说明大都是陈腐的。上册一七七页关于国都的位置在正文内曾作了修改，但在习题内仍将南京当作首都来发问。学生在这些陈腐的材料与说明中，所认识到的中国仍然是半封建半殖民地的中国，他们不可能从这种地理教本中了解新中国的新面貌，人民的中国的新姿态。
