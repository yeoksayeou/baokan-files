Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 18th: UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie held a press conference at the United Nations Information Center in Moscow on May 17th. A large number of Soviet and foreign reporters attended.

At the beginning of the press conference, Lie first read a written statement in which he answered several questions that had been put to him in advance.

Lie said: "Some people asked me who I have met with? You all and I know that I have met with Marshal Stalin, Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Mr. Molotov, Minister of Foreign Affairs Mr. Vyshinsky, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mr. Gromyko, and former UN Under-Secretary-General Mr. Sobolev.

"I was treated with the utmost friendliness, and the exchange of opinions and views was of a positive nature.

"Some people asked me what we discussed? Our talks centered on the general international situation, China's representation in the United Nations, and the so-called 'Cold War'. Among other matters discussed, I can also mention the issue of holding periodic meetings of the Security Council in accordance with Article 28, Paragraph 2 of the UN Charter, and the issue of the control of atomic energy.

"Some people asked me whether I feel satisfied with the results of discussions with the leaders of the four capitals I have visited since April 20th? On this point, I only need to point out that the Secretary-General of the United Nations cannot feel satisfied until the normal work of the United Nations organization is ensured, the Cold War is stopped, and friendly relations are established among the member states.

"Some people asked me if I am satisfied with the talks in Moscow? I have no reason not to be satisfied with the talks I held in Moscow. However, a final judgment cannot be made until two or three months from now, or perhaps even a longer period."

When answering questions raised by reporters, Lie expressed his hope that the difficulties encountered by the United Nations could be resolved before the next session of the United Nations General Assembly in September.

In response to another question, the UN Secretary-General recalled his recent speech in Geneva, where he expressed the hope that the admission of nine European countries that have applied to join the United Nations as member states would strengthen Europe's voice in the United Nations. Lie suggested admitting these nine countries to the United Nations. This matter still needs to be considered by the Security Council. Lie further pointed out: In addition to the aforementioned European countries, there are also five other countries that have applied to join the United Nations, for a total of fourteen countries.

In response to another question, Lie said that he hoped to meet with the British Prime Minister and the French Prime Minister or the Foreign Ministers of Britain and France on his way to New York, and then meet with Truman and Acheson.

Someone asked Lie what steps he planned to take to ensure that the representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China obtain their rightful place in the United Nations organization. Lie replied that this matter must await a decision by the Security Council.

A foreign reporter asked: "When you spoke with the Soviet leaders, did they express their desire for peace?" Lie replied: "This idea was the keynote of all my talks with the Soviet leaders."

Lie further pointed out that he also heard expressions of desire for peace when he held discussions in other capitals.

As the press conference was coming to an end, reporters asked Lie to describe his impressions of Moscow. He said that this was his fifth visit to the Soviet Union, and he had seen Moscow in peacetime and wartime. He said: The achievements made are self-evident.

　　赖伊在苏京招待记者
　　希望联合国遭遇的困难九月前能解决
    【新华社十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十八日讯：联合国秘书长赖伊于五月十七日在联合国驻莫斯科新闻处举行记者招待会。到会的有大批苏联记者和外籍记者。
    在记者招待会开始时，赖伊先宣读书面谈话，他在其中答复了事先向他提出的若干问题。
    赖伊说：“有人问我，我已会见过什么人？你们大家和我都知道：我已会见过斯大林大元帅、部长会议副主席莫洛托夫先生、外交部部长维辛斯基先生、外交部副部长葛罗米柯先生和前任联合国副秘书长索波列夫先生。
    “我受到了以最友好的方式安排的款待，而且意见和观点的交换都是属于积极性的。
    “有人问我，我们在商谈什么事情？我们的谈话是以一般国际形势、中国在联合国中的代表性以及所谓“冷战”为中心。在所讨论的其他事项中，我还可以提起依照联合国宪章第二十八条第二款安理会定期举行会议的问题，和原子能的管制问题。
    “有人问我，从四月二十日以来，在我已经访问过的四国首都中，与那些国家的领袖们讨论的结果，我是否觉得满意？对于这一点，我只要指出，在联合国组织正常工作、冷战被制止，而且在各会员国之间建立友好关系之前，联合国秘书长是不能够觉得满意的。
    “有人问我，我是否满意在莫斯科的会谈？我没有理由不满意我在莫斯科举行的会谈。不过，在今后两三个月之前不能作最后的判断，也许还要经过较长的一段时期。”
    赖伊回答记者们所提出的问题时，表示希望联合国所遭遇的困难，在九月间举行联合国大会下届会议之前予以解决。
    在回答所提出的另一个问题时，联合国秘书长回忆他最近在日内瓦发表过的谈话，他在那里曾经表示希望已提出申请的欧洲九个国家加入联合国为会员国，会使欧洲在联合国中的发言权更有力量。赖伊建议让这九个国家加入联合国。这件事还要由安理会考虑。赖伊进一步指出：除了上述欧洲国家以外，还有也已申请加入联合国的五个别的国家，共计是十四个国家。
    在回答所提出的另一个问题时，赖伊说：他希望在赴纽约的途中，与英国首相及法国总理或英法的外交部长们会晤，随后还要与杜鲁门及艾奇逊会晤。
    有人问赖伊，准备采取什么步骤以确保中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表在联合国组织中获得他们正当的地位。赖伊回答说：这件事要等安理会决定。
    一个外籍记者问：“你和苏联领袖们会谈的时候，他们曾否表示他们对和平的热望？”赖伊回答说：“这种观念乃是我和苏联领袖们举行的一切会谈的主调。”
    赖伊进一步指出：他在其他各国首都举行商谈时，他也听到了表示热望和平的话。
    记者招待会快结束时，记者们请赖伊叙述他对莫斯科的印象。他说：他这次访问苏联已经是第五次了，他已看见过和平时期与战争时期的莫斯科。他说：所达到的成就是不言自明的。
