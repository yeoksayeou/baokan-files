　　Gottwald's name evokes warm feelings among the working people of Czechoslovakia, just as Mao Zedong's name evokes feelings among the working people of China. He represents all the excellent qualities of the Czech working class, and his life story is also the history of the Czech working class advancing towards its goals. This class went through a thorny but glorious road to establish Czech democracy, and finally achieved victory.

　　Gottwald was born in 1896 in a small village in Moravia. His parents were impoverished peasants, so his childhood was exceptionally difficult and devoid of joy. When he was a child, he left home to become a carpenter's apprentice in a big city. Early on, he began to wonder why so many people toiled year after year without enough to eat, while a few idlers possessed enormous wealth.

　　His neighbors were all hardworking and impoverished people, and he grew up among them, influenced by them, thus developing the unique character of a worker. One of his closest friends said: "Gottwald possesses the finest qualities of two classes. The working class endowed him with a determined, courageous character, revolutionary enthusiasm, and unwavering loyalty to the revolution. The peasant class endowed him with wisdom, foresight, and the demeanor of a statesman."

　　In 1917, Gottwald was conscripted into the army to participate in the First World War. During this period, he maintained close contact with the masses and gained a deep understanding of them, which later became a characteristic of his revolutionary career. He participated in the imperialist war as a class-conscious revolutionary fighter, and when the war ended, the great October Revolution took place in Russia. After leaving the imperialist battlefield, Gottwald immediately joined the class struggle, which was a decisive factor in his life. He participated in the struggle to realize the lofty goals of the working class. He fought for socialism and communism and became the most ardent and diligent revolutionary, and one of the best students of Lenin and Stalin in the struggle.

　　He was learning, and at the same time teaching the Czech working masses how to apply and implement revolutionary Marxism-Leninism. Soon he became an excellent politician, a Bolshevik, leading the masses to resist oppression. Since seceding from the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, Czechoslovakia had been a typical bourgeois state. The leaders of the Social Democratic Party deceived the workers by saying that they were working hard to establish a socialist country, just like the Russian proletariat had achieved. The workers were enslaved by the capitalists. Since 1929, Gottwald had taken the lead in this battle, and he became the chairman of the Czech Communist Party. Before that, the CPCz was not entirely Bolshevik. Since the establishment of the CPCz in 1921, it had gone through several crises, mainly due to the tendency of opportunists and opponents of the working class among some leaders of the working class. After Gottwald took the leadership, a clear line of action was drawn, and there could be no compromise in the struggle against exploiters and reactionary capitalists. Gottwald gained immense confidence from the Czech workers and peasants, as well as from the Executive Committee of the Communist International. He himself was elected as a member of the Executive Committee of the Communist International in 1928.

　　Gottwald never stopped mobilizing the masses in the fight against capitalism and imperialism. He foresaw the danger of war long before the imperialists launched the Second World War, and he warned the working people of Czechoslovakia. He told them that the Communist Party was determined to defend the interests of the masses without hesitation and to resist all war measures of the imperialist countries.

　　From the so-called Western democracies offering Czechoslovakia to German imperialism, to the later German imperialist occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938, Gottwald was forced to go into exile in Moscow to continue working and fighting for the freedom of the people. In Moscow, the anti-imperialist struggle was led by Comrade Stalin.

　　After the victorious Red Army marched into Central Europe and dealt a fatal blow to the fascist bandits, Gottwald returned to his liberated motherland to lead the people towards socialism. But the remnants of the reactionaries were not exhausted, and they were still trying to sabotage the construction of the country in secret. The Communist Party under the leadership of Gottwald had to actively fight to achieve the goal of establishing a truly people's democratic state. This bloodless battle was won. In February 1948, when the reactionary forces were finally and decisively defeated, the broad road to building socialism was opened up. In those important days of February, Gottwald's brilliant leadership won him and the Communist Party the infinite gratitude of the working people. He himself proved to be not only a loyal son of the people, but also a great statesman. Since returning from Moscow, he had participated in government work. After February 1948, the people of Czechoslovakia believed that Gottwald was the most suitable person to lead the Czech people to build a socialist and happy future, so they elected him as the President of the Czechoslovak Republic. In this way, a man like Gottwald, who came from the people, changed from a worker to the President of the Czechoslovak Republic. He was the most suitable person for this position; he was the captain of the ship, holding the rudder, sailing towards the goal of socialism.

　　捷克人民的领袖哥特瓦尔德
    洪楚贤  李秋德译
    哥特瓦尔德这个名字，在捷克的劳动人民中唤起了亲切的感情，正如毛泽东的名字在中国劳动人民中所唤起的感情一样。他代表着捷克工人阶级的一切优势的素质，他的生命史同时又是捷克工人阶级向其目标前进的历史。为了建立捷克的民主，这个阶级走过一段布满荆棘同时又是光明灿烂的道路，而于最后获得了胜利。
    哥特瓦尔德于一八九六年诞生于摩拉维亚省的一个小村。他的父母是赤贫的农民，因此幼年时代生活困苦异常，绝无欢乐可言。当他还是一个小孩子的时候，他就离开家庭到一个大城市去当木匠的学徒。他很早就开始怀疑，为什么许多人劳苦终年，不得一饱，少数人终日赋闲却拥有巨大的财富。
    他的邻里都是勤劳而赤贫的人，他自幼和他们相处，受他们的影响，因此养成了劳动者所特有的性格。他的一个最亲密的朋友说过：“哥特瓦尔德有着两个阶级的最优秀的素质。工人阶级赋给他坚决、勇敢的性格、革命的热情，和对于革命的不屈不挠的忠诚。农民阶级赋给他明智与远见，以及政治家的风度。”
    一九一七年，哥特瓦尔德应征入伍，参加第一次世界大战。这个时期他和群众保持密切的接触，对群众有了深切的了解，这在日后便成为他的革命生涯的特色。他是以一个有着阶级觉悟的革命战士的身份参加帝国主义的战争的，而当这个战争结束的时候，俄国便发生了伟大的十月革命。哥特瓦尔德离开帝国主义的战场以后，立即参加阶级斗争，这对于他的一生是一个有着决定意义的因素。他参加斗争的目的，是为了要实现工人阶级的崇高的目的。他为社会主义和共产主义而斗争，而在斗争中成为最热烈、最辛勤的革命家，成为列宁和斯大林的一个最好的学生。
    他在学习，同时也在教导捷克的劳动大众，怎样应用和实行革命的马列主义。不久他就成了一个最好的政治家，一个布尔什维克，他领导着群众反抗压迫。自从一九一八年脱离奥匈帝国以后，捷克是个典型的资产阶级的国家。社会民主党的领袖欺骗工人们说他们在努力建立一个社会主义的国家，像俄国无产阶级所成就的一样。工人们为资本家所奴役。自一九二九年以来哥特瓦尔德就取得了这次战斗的领导，他做了捷克共产党的主席。在那以前，捷共并非完全是布尔什维克型的，自从一九二一年捷共成立以来，主要由于机会主义者及反对工人阶级者的那种倾向存在于工人阶级的若干领袖中间，捷共还历经了几次危机。在哥特瓦尔德取得了领导权之后，立刻行动的清楚的界线划出来了，在反抗剥削者和反动资本家的奋斗中是没有妥协的可能的。哥特瓦尔德自捷克的工人和农民间，以及国际共产党执行委员会获得了无比的信心。他自己在一九二八年就被选为国际共产党执行委员会的一员了。
    哥特瓦尔德从未在反对资本主义和帝国主义的战斗中停止动员群众。他远在帝国主义发动二次大战之前就预见了战争的危险性，他并警告过捷克的劳动人民。他告诉他们共产党已有毫不退缩的决心来保卫群众的利益，反抗帝国主义国家的一切战争措施。
    从所谓西方民主国家将捷克斯洛伐克奉献给德国帝国主义，到后来在一九三八年德国帝国主义占领捷克，哥特瓦尔德被迫出走至莫斯科继续为人民的自由而工作和奋斗。在莫斯科，反帝的奋斗是由斯大林同志领导着的。
    胜利的红军开进中欧，给法西斯党徒致命的一击后，哥特瓦尔德才回到解放了的祖国，来领导人民走向社会主义。但是反动派的余孽未尽，他们还在一再企图暗中破坏国家的建设工作。在哥特瓦尔德领导下的共产党必须为达到建立真正的人民民主国家的目的而积极奋斗。这不流血的一仗是打胜了。一九四八年二月，当反动力量被最后决定性地击败时，建设社会主义的康庄大道才开拓出来了。在二月中那些重要的日子里，哥特瓦尔德的灿烂的领导功绩为他自己及共产党赢得劳动人民无限的感激。他自己则证明了不只是人民的忠实的儿子，并且是一个伟大的政治家。自从他离莫斯科返国后就参加了政府工作。一九四八年二月之后，捷克斯洛伐克人民认为哥特瓦尔德是最适合于领导捷克人民建立社会主义的幸福的将来的人物，所以选举了他做捷克斯洛伐克共和国的总统。这样，像哥特瓦尔德那样一个从人民中来的人，就从一个工人变为捷克斯洛伐克共和国的总统了。他是最该任这项职务的；他是船上的船长，正把着舵轮，开向社会主义的鹄的。
