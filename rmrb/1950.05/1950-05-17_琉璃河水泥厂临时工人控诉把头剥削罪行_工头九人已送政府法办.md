　　Liulihe Cement Plant Temporary Workers Accuse Foremen of Exploitation; Nine Foremen Have Been Sent to the Government for Legal Action
    [Reported by this newspaper] After two weeks of investigation and preparation, the Liulihe Cement Plant convened a temporary workers' accusation meeting on April 20 to expose the cruel exploitation of workers by nine major foremen, including Wang Gui and Niu Yuhai. The person in charge of the plant accepted the request of all workers at the meeting and decided to send the nine people to the People's Court for handling.
    Since the plant started construction last year, nine major foremen, including Wang Gui, have successively entered the plant and seized the positions of foremen of outside workers, oppressing and exploiting the workers in various ways. The plant stipulated that the wage for pushing one ton of stones was 1.4 liters of corn, but the foremen actually paid the workers 1.2 liters. The wage for pushing one ton of coal or gypsum was 1.5 liters, but the foremen actually paid 1.3 liters. The plant stipulated that the tool fee would only be deducted by 0.1 liters of corn, but the foremen actually deducted 0.2 liters. In more than two months this year, they embezzled and exploited more than 30 million yuan. Four foremen infiltrated the preparatory committee of the "temporary workers" branch union, with Wang Gui becoming the director and Liu Lianzhong becoming the deputy director. Wang Gui also infiltrated the local CCP organization. These two relied on exploiting workers for a living during the enemy-puppet and Kuomintang periods, accumulating many years of exploitation experience. The workers were angry but dared not speak out. On April 6, the administrative负责人派员深入工人调查把头罪行, when the workers saw the foremen coming, they said to the cadres: "Our bosses are here, you should leave quickly!"
    Since liberation, the plant has cleaned out three major foreman elements, Zhang Baozhong, Guo Lianzeng, and Ning Guoping. However, because the administrative负责人 did not have a sufficient understanding of the actual situation of temporary workers, the remnants of the foremen were not completely eliminated. It was not until internal strife occurred between the foremen that the administration investigated based on clues and discovered this serious problem, deciding to completely abolish the unreasonable foreman system and its remnants.

　　琉璃河水泥厂临时工人控诉把头剥削罪行
　　工头九人已送政府法办
    【本报讯】琉璃河水泥厂经过两周的调查、酝酿后，于四月二十日召开临时工人控诉大会，揭发王贵、牛玉海等九个大工头惨酷剥削工人的罪行。该厂负责人在会上接受全体工人的要求，决将该九人送人民法院处理。
    该厂自去年开工后，王贵等九个大工头先后入厂攫取了外工工头的职位，多方压迫、剥削工人。厂方规定推一吨石头的工资为玉米一·四升，工头实发给工人一·二升。推一吨煤或石膏的工资为一·五升，工头实发一·三升。厂方规定工具费只抽一合玉米，工头实抽二合。在今年两个多月中，他们贪污、剥削达三千多万元。有四个工头钻“临时工”分工会筹备委会，王贵当了主任，刘连仲当了副主任。王贵且钻入当地中共党组织内。这两人在敌伪及国民党时期，就依赖剥削工人为生，积有多年剥削经验。工人敢怒而不敢言。四月六日，行政负责人派员深入工人调查把头罪行，工人一看工头走来，就对干部说：“我们头子来了，你们快走吧！”
    解放以来，该厂曾把三个主要把头分子张宝忠、郭连增、宁国平清洗出厂。但因行政负责人对临时工的实际情况了解不够，致把头残余未能完全取消。直到把头之间发生内哄，行政上才根据线索，加以调查，发现了这个严重问题，决定彻底废除不合理的把头制度及其残余。
