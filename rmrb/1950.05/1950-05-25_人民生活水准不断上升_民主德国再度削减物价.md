　　People's Living Standards Continue to Rise
    Democratic Germany Further Reduces Prices
    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 22nd] (TASS) – The living standards of the people of the German Democratic Republic are constantly rising. Two months ago, the average price of fats and oils in state-owned and cooperative trade was reduced by 40%, and meat by 25%. Now, it has been announced that the prices of fats and oils, meat, and eggs in stores will be greatly reduced. Pork prices will be reduced by 21%, veal by 12%, beef by 13%, sausage by 18%, fats and oils (except margarine) by 18%, and eggs by 30%.

    This new reduction in prices once again convincingly demonstrates that the German Democratic Republic is following the correct path of peaceful progress.
