Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 15th: Spring sowing work in Shandong Province was basically completed in late April. In mid-April, the province experienced widespread and thorough rainfall. Coupled with the basic stabilization of the disaster situation across the province, the broad masses of farmers actively engaged in the upsurge of sowing. Farmers in the low-lying areas along the banks of the Dongping, Dushan, and Weishan Lakes in the western part of the province, under the leadership of the local people's government, actively carried out drainage and rushed to plant crops. The four counties of Dongping and Pingyin alone rushed to plant more than 400,000 mu of autumn grain. By the end of April, all crops that should have been sown, except for cotton and other crops with later planting seasons, had been sown. Autumn sprouts in the areas where sowing was earlier have now emerged, and the seedlings are extremely robust. Farmers in various localities have now shifted to summer hoeing work.

In the spring sowing work, the people's governments of various counties mobilized and organized farmers to carry out labor exchange and mutual assistance by convening people's representative conferences, labor model conferences, and farmer representative conferences. The Central and Southern Shandong District has restored 88,476 original mutual-aid teams. According to incomplete statistics from six counties in the Binhai Special District of the same region, more than 1,000 newly developed mutual-aid teams have also been established. These work exchange teams played a huge role in the spring sowing work. The provincial people's government also promptly distributed 53 million jin of spring loan grain, focusing on supporting disaster victims to carry out sowing, so that the sowing work was successfully completed.

During spring sowing, farmers in various localities, under the guidance of agricultural technicians from various county farms, carried out seed replacement and seed soaking. Due to the extensive fertilizer accumulation campaign carried out throughout the province last winter, the amount of fertilizer applied to the land this spring has greatly increased compared to last year. For example, in the Jiaodong area, more than 60 percent of farming households applied one or half a cart more fertilizer to the land this spring compared to last year.

　　山东春播基本完成
　　秋苗出土极为茁壮
    【新华社济南十五日电】山东省春季播种工作已于四月下旬基本完成。该省四月中旬普降透雨，加上全省灾情基本稳定，广大农民均积极投入播种热潮。西部东平、独山、微山湖两岸低洼被水淹没地区的农民在当地人民政府领导之下，积极展开排水抢种，仅东平、平阴等四县即抢种秋禾四十余万亩。至四月下旬，全省除播种季节较晚的棉花等作物外，其他应种作物均已播种完毕。播种较早地区的秋苗现已出土，小苗极为茁壮。现各地农民均已转入夏锄工作。
    在春播工作中，各县人民政府均通过召开各界人民代表会、劳动模范会、农民代表会等发动和组织农民进行变工互助。鲁中南区已恢复了原有插伙组八八、四七六个，另据该区滨海专区六个县的不完全统计，新发展的插伙组亦有一千余个。这些变工组在春播工作中发挥了巨大作用。该省人民政府还及时地发放春季贷粮五千三百万斤，有重点地扶持灾民进行播种，使播种工作顺利完成。
    在春播中，各地农民在各县农场技术人员的指导之下，均进行了换种和浸种。由于去冬全省各地广泛展开积肥运动，今年春地的施肥量较去年大大增加。如胶东地区有百分之六十以上的农户今年春地施肥量较去年多一车或半车。
