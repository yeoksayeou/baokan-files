　　Comrade Li Qingxuan of the Hegang Mine, who won the first-class Red Flag Medal, has been promoted to head of the production technology section since the success of the medicine pot-style slotting pick. He is now leading the pilot project for mechanized coal mining.

　　Mechanized longwall coal mining is being carried out by Comrade Li Qingxuan, leading the workers of working face 120 in the Dongshan No. 6 pit. He moved to the Dongshan Building on April 16th. Besides planning how to configure the coal cutting machine, scraper conveyor, pneumatic picks, etc., and how to carry out the work, he would take the time to go into the working face to measure the dimensions, inspect the installation site, and then return to draw diagrams to discuss with the mechanical and electrical workers.

　　As soon as the enthusiastic mobilization meeting was over, the workers surrounded Li Qingxuan, vying to sign up, insisting that he agree to their participation in mechanized coal mining. Those who signed up crowded forward, raising their fists and shouting at him: "We are not afraid of any difficulties!" "We will follow your allocation and guidance!" "We guarantee to complete a daily output of 300 tons!" The voices became more and more chaotic, and the crowd was three layers deep, all raising their fists demanding tasks.

　　Li Qingxuan worked from dawn till dusk with the workers in the pit preparing for mechanization, his face streaming with sweat, helping to move the machinery, paying attention to the situation at the working face, and noting the team leader's temporary work reports. The 55-meter-long longwall face was opened, and the 70-meter-long scraper conveyor, a coal cutting machine, six pneumatic picks... hummed to life. The workers' picks were tightly against the roof, and the pneumatic picks were inserted into the coal to cut loose the seam, and the oily black bright coal rolled down. Loading, pushing, one after another forming a force, the support carpenters were busy making temporary filling wood stacks. In the past, the coal cutting machine advanced an average of 10 meters per hour, but now, with the effectiveness of the machinery, it has reached 40 meters. From April 22nd to April 26th, the daily output gradually increased from 250 tons to 387 tons, exceeding the plan by 87 tons.

　　The safety lamp illuminated Li Qingxuan's smiling face. Visitors surrounded him and shook his hand. He said happily, "There is too much coal! In the past, our difficulty was that we couldn't get the coal out. In the future, 80 percent of the large working faces will be mechanized, and we will be able to complete our production tasks sooner!"

　　Mechanized coal mining has solved two problems: 1. Explosives: In the past, every ton of coal required 300 watts of explosives, but now it has been reduced to 20 watts. Except for blasting at the chute opening, the rest is done with pneumatic picks instead of blasting, which solves the difficulty of insufficient explosives; 2. Specialized division of labor and piecework: In the past, there was a phenomenon of unclear division of labor and everyone grabbing at everything in coal mining. Now, mechanized coal mining first clarifies the division of labor. For example, operating the coal cutting machine, pneumatic picks, supports, filling, transportation, pulling the chute, picks... are all the responsibility of specific people, so that they can study technology, improve technology, and further establish contact contracts. The Dongshan Mine is preparing to promote mechanized coal mining in the seventh pit of the main incline and the left third section of the third incline of the sixth pit.

　　Li Qingxuan's heart was as happy as a blossoming flower. He said to everyone, "There is too much coal! Let's mechanize quickly and build a new industrialized China!"

　　机械化采煤
　　黄主亚
    鹤岗矿山荣获一等红旗奖章的李庆萱同志，从打药壶式掏槽焊子成功后，已被提升为生产技术科科长。现在他正领导着机械化采煤试点。
    机械化长壁式采煤，是李庆萱同志领导东山六坑一二○掌子工友干的。四月十六日他搬到东山大楼，除了计划截煤机、笨溜子、风镐等怎样配置，怎样进行工作外，有时间自己就钻进掌子里量尺码，察看按设地场，回来画了图就跟机电工友核计。
    热烘烘的动员大会刚开完，工友把李庆萱围在当中争着报名，非要求他答应参加机械化采煤不可。报名的往上挤，举着拳头冲他喊：“我们什么困难都不怕！”“听从你的分配和指导！”“保证完成日产量三百吨！”声音越喊越乱，围得里三层外三层都是人，都举着拳头要求任务。
    李庆萱起早贪黑跟工友在坑里作机械化的准备工作，满脸淌着汗，帮助挪机械，留心掌子情况，注意班长的临时工作报告。长壁式五十五米长的掌子面开好了，七十米长的笨溜子，一台截煤机、六台风镐……呜呜的响了，工友的镐紧找顶，风镐插在煤里开帮，油黑的亮煤翻花往下滚。装车、推车，一个接着一个拧成劲，支柱木匠忙打临时充填木垛。过去截煤机每点钟平均前进十米，现在发挥了机械效能，达到四十米。从四月二十二号起到二十六号止，由二百五十吨逐渐提高到三百八十七吨，超过计划八十七吨。
    安全灯照着李庆萱欢笑的脸，参观的人围上来跟他握手，他高兴的说：“这煤太多了，以前咱们困难的就是有煤拿不出来；将来大掌子百分之八十都改成机械化，咱们生产任务就能更早完成了！”
    机械化采煤解决了两个问题：一、火药：过去每吨煤需要三百瓦，现在减到二十瓦，除了找溜子口放炮外，剩下全用风镐代替放炮，解决了炮药不足的困难；二、专业化分工计件：过去采煤上有着分工不明，大伙乱抓的现象。现在机械化采煤首先明确分工，比方开截煤机、风镐、支柱、充填、运搬、拨溜子、刨镐……都是专人负责，这样可以研究技术，提高技术，更进一步的订立联系合同。东山矿已准备在七坑本斜，六坑三斜左三片，推行机械化采煤。
    李庆萱的心乐得像开了花，对大伙说：“这煤太多了，快点机械化，建设工业化新中国！”
