Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 10th: Isakov, in an article titled "The London Conference of the Organizers of the Atlantic Group" in *Labor Daily*, stated: The foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France will hold a meeting in London on May 11th. Now, negotiations on the conference agenda are nearing completion. However, even the preliminary discussion of the conference agenda reflects the contradictions between the imperialist accomplices.

Isakov pointed out: At present, the complete failure of the Marshall Plan can no longer be concealed. Therefore, the U.S. imperialists are desperately seeking new paths. Washington's "overall" diplomats have decided to transform the Atlantic Alliance into a more tightly knit organization, becoming an "American World State."

The editors of the International Department of *Business Week*, disseminated in Western Europe, announced that a "transformation" of American foreign policy is now in preparation. The bets placed on the "Marshall Plan" and the European Union will be discarded. The U.S. representative in Paris admitted that attempts to establish a European Union on the basis of the "Marshall Plan" have reached a "dead end." Therefore, the United States now has no choice but to make a final gamble on the Atlantic Alliance.

According to the *Business Week* editors, the United States will exert "strong pressure" on Western European countries to militarize them and turn their economies into a wartime system. Western European countries must increase military spending to benefit the manufacture of U.S. munitions: Britain must increase its military spending by at least 125 million pounds annually, and France by 100 billion francs.

Isakov pointed out: The efforts of U.S. diplomats in London will focus on the transformation of the Atlantic Alliance. Another key point is to make West Germany the center of the transformed alliance in Europe. German monopoly capitalists—former Hitlerites in West Germany, who are acting as masters—will be assigned to serve as the backbone of the Atlantic Alliance in Europe.

At the same time, according to the State Department's plan, countries participating in the reorganized Atlantic Alliance must abandon their last vestiges of independence and sovereignty.

These are the outlines of the reorganization of the Atlantic Alliance formulated by U.S. imperialism. It is unlikely that this blueprint will encourage America's European partners.

In speaking of the contradictions existing among the imperialists, Isakov pointed out: It is beyond doubt that a fierce behind-the-scenes struggle will be provoked in London, and solemn speeches and whitewashed communiqués cannot conceal this point.

The main battle in London will take place between Britain and the United States.

As for the French ruling clique? They are largely acting in accordance with U.S. instructions, and they are attempting to exploit the contradictions between Britain and the United States to achieve their own interests.

Isakov emphasized in conclusion: No matter what the outcome of the meeting, the future of the war-mongers' frantic disputes surrounding all kinds of aggressive alliances and blocs is bleak. These disputes have not saved them from failure in the past, and they will not be able to save them from failure in the future. The bankruptcy of the Marshall Plan and other related alliance systems is an ominous sign for these new versions of the Atlantic Group plans.

　　劳动报评三外长会议
　　帝国主义同伙间矛盾日趋剧烈 
    美帝大西洋集团新版亦必破产
    【新华社十一日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十日讯：伊萨科夫以《大西洋集团组织者的伦敦会议》为题，在劳动报上撰文称：美、英、法三国外长会议将于五月十一日在伦敦举行。现在，关于会议议程的商谈已趋于结束。但是，即令对会议议程的初步讨论，也反映出帝国主义同伙之间的矛盾。
    伊萨科夫指出：目前，已再也不能掩饰马歇尔计划的一败涂地了。因此，美帝国主义者正在拚命地觅取新的途径。华盛顿的“总体”外交官决定改造大西洋联盟，使之更为紧密，而成为“美国人的世界国”的组织。
    在西欧散布的商业周刊国外部的编辑们宣布：美国外交政策的“转变”，现已在准备中。为“马歇尔计划”及欧洲联盟所下的赌注，将被弃置不顾。美国驻巴黎的代表承认：在“马歇尔计划”的基础上成立欧洲联盟的企图已经走上了“绝路”。所以，美国从现在起，只好以大西洋联盟来作孤注一掷。
    据商业周刊编辑称：美国将以“强大的压力”加于西欧各国，使它们军事化，把它们的经济变成战时体制。西欧各国必须增加军费，俾有利于美国军火的制造：英国的军费每年至少增加一亿二千五百万英镑，法国增加一千亿法郎。
    伊萨科夫指出：美国外交官在伦敦的努力，将集中于大西洋联盟的改造上，另一点，就是要使西德变成改造后的联盟在欧洲的中心。德国垄断资本家——前希特勒分子在当主人的西德，将被派定充当大西洋联盟在欧洲的骨干。
    同时，根据国务院的计划，参与改组后的大西洋联盟的国家，必须放弃其最后一点的独立与主权。
    这些就是美帝国主义所拟定的改组大西洋联盟的轮廓。人们很少可能来讲这幅构图能够鼓励美国的欧洲伙伴们。
    伊萨科夫在说到帝国主义之间存在的矛盾时指出：在伦敦势将惹起一场剧烈的幕后斗争，已是无可怀疑的了，庄严的演辞与粉饰太平的公报，都不能掩饰这一点。
    伦敦将要发生英美之间的主要争夺战。
    至于法国统治集团呢？他们大体上是依照美国的训令行事的，他们企图利用英美矛盾而达到他们自己的利益。
    伊萨科夫在结语中强调指出：无论会议的结果怎样，围绕在所有各种侵略联盟与集团周围的战争贩子们疯狂的纷争，其前途都是悲惨的。这种纷争过去并不曾将他们从失败中拯救出来，而且将来也不能把他们从失败中拯救出来。马歇尔计划和其他与之有关的联盟体系的破产，便是这些大西洋集团新版计划的一个恶兆。
