　　Over a Thousand Young League Members in Shenyang Factories Set New Records

    [This newspaper dispatch] Shenyang City's factories and enterprises' Young League members have played a significant role in the New Record movement. Over the past six months, one thousand one hundred and forty Young League members have created new records. With the development of the New Record movement, the prestige of the Young League has greatly increased, and a large number of activists have requested to join the League. According to February statistics, the number of League members in the city's factories has grown to eleven thousand five hundred and twenty-six; at the same time, a large number of outstanding League members have honorably joined the Chinese Communist Party, now accounting for 17.4% of the city's League members.

    As early as last year's Red May production competition, there were instances of Young League members in Shenyang City factories setting new records. For example, Zhou Lianzhi, a League member at the Rubber Factory of the 3rd Quartermaster Bureau, broke the quota of 280 shoe uppers by increasing it to 600. Mu Zaibin, a League member at the Trolleybus Factory, reduced the time for repairing ball bearing races from the usual four hours to one hour. However, these new records did not receive enough attention from the leadership at the time and were not promoted in a timely manner. It was not until Zhao Guoyou, a League member at the 3rd Machine Factory, created a new record for cutting turrets last October, that it gradually developed into a mass movement with the strong promotion of the leadership. The administration, trade union, and the Communist Party and Young League of the 3rd Machine Factory jointly organized workers to visit Zhao Guoyou's creation and called on everyone to create new records. The League branch actively responded and mobilized League members and workers to launch challenges and responses, and new records continued to emerge. For example, Dang Huian and Zhao Fuyou created a new record for cutting lead screws, increasing efficiency by ten to twelve times compared to the original working hours; Zhang Shangju's scribing team created a new record for scribing six-foot lathes, increasing efficiency by fifteen times. Later, under the leadership of the Northeast Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Northeast Industrial Bureau and the Machinery Bureau conducted a summary, pointing out that these new records created by advanced producers "are matters of great political significance in the industrial construction of the Northeast, and they have profound revolutionary implications." They made a decision to launch a mass movement to create new production records. The Shenyang Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League convened a meeting of League cadres from factories throughout the city, where Zhao Guoyou introduced his preliminary experience in creating new records. It also established key factory work, conducted in-depth leadership, researched experiences, introduced typical examples, discovered problems, and solved problems, providing the League with specific and timely guidance in the movement. From then on, in all state-owned factories in the city, wherever there were League members, the movement to create new records gradually unfolded. League members, on the one hand, became motivators for the broad masses of workers, writing Yangko songs, drum ballads, and news reports, and conducting oral propaganda to explain the significance of creating new records, breaking down the concerns of some conservative workers who were unwilling to create new records and fearing that creating new records would lead to factory layoffs, and promoting and encouraging workers to create new records. On the other hand, League members themselves enthusiastically threw themselves into the movement to create new records: League members with technical skills actively studied and created, such as Yue Zhenshan and others, League members from the 54 Factory, who created four new records in a row; some apprentice League members helped and encouraged their masters to create, such as Wang Xuegen, a League member from the 1st Machine Factory, who mobilized his master to create a new record, and as a result, both master and apprentice achieved success and were listed on the honor roll; some League members participated in collective creation, such as the lathe group of the Electric Motor Factory, which collectively created a new record and won the title of model group in the factory.

    In this year's first quarter (January to March) production tasks, the Youth League, centering on the production work center proposed by the Party and the government, actively participated in tasks such as setting quotas, establishing connection contracts and collective contracts, and launched the establishment of master-apprentice contracts, mobilizing League members and young workers to learn technology, and further promoting the mass movement to create new production records. For example, Tong Junshan, a League member from the Fifth Machine Factory, created a new record on March 12, increasing the time for turning light rods from the quota of three hours to fifty minutes, and then further improved from fifty minutes to thirty-four minutes on March 29.

    In the New Record movement, League members have also encountered some shortcomings. For example, some League members create new records themselves but are unwilling to cooperate with fellow workers, fearing that "others will create new records and they will not be able to show themselves"; some apprentice League members create new records and want to "compete with their masters," causing dissatisfaction among the masters; many apprentice League members, seeing that technicians are constantly creating new records, lack confidence and say, "Without technology, you can't create new records"; some League members emphasize quantity over quality when creating records; some factories create many new records but fail to complete their production tasks; and the leadership of some branches are in a passive position, not actively organizing creation but generally calling for it and waiting for new records to emerge. The League's leadership organs have paid attention to gradually correcting these shortcomings in the movement.

    Currently, the Northeast Party and the Ministry of Industry have put forward that the central task for the second quarter is to establish a responsibility system. The Shenyang Municipal Youth League has already begun to show its role in this central task. For example, the Chemical Factory League discovered eleven phenomena for which no one was responsible, and the East Electric Factory No. 1 League branch put forward eighty-one rationalization proposals to the Party, government, and trade union. It is expected that new records will be further developed on the basis of the responsibility system. The Youth League will also further play a greater role.

### 沈阳各工厂青年团员千余人创新纪录

　　沈阳各工厂青年团员千余人创新纪录
    【本报讯】沈阳市各工厂、企业的青年团员，在新纪录运动中发挥了重大的作用。六个月来，已有一千一百四十名青年团员创造了新纪录。随着新纪录运动的发展，青年团的威信大大提高，大批积极分子要求入团。据二月份统计，全市工厂团员已发展到一万一千五百二十六名；同时，大批优秀团员光荣地加入了中国共产党，现在全市团员中入党的已占百分之十七点四。
    远在去年红五月生产竞赛中，沈阳市工厂团员中就有了创新纪录的事实，如军需三局橡胶厂团员周莲芝刷鞋帮，突破二百八十双的定额增至六百双；电车厂团员穆在斌修滚珠套，由一般常用的四小时缩短至一小时。但这些新纪录当时尚未引起领导上足够的重视，未能及时推广。直到去年十月机器三厂团员赵国有创造了切削塔轮的新纪录之后，经领导上有力的提倡，始逐渐发展为群众性的运动。机器三厂的行政、工会与共产党、青年团共同组织工人参观了赵国有的创造，号召大家创新纪录。团支部积极响应，并动员团员与工人群众掀起挑战应战，新纪录乃不断出现。如党会安、赵富有创造了截削丝杠的新纪录，按原工时提高了效率十倍至十二倍；张尚举划线小组创造了六尺车床划线的新纪录，提高了效率十五倍。以后，在中共中央东北局领导下，东北工业局和机械局进行了总结。指出这些先进生产者所创造的新纪录，“是东北工业建设中有重大政治意义的事情，它具有深刻的革命性。”并作出决定，号召开展群众性的创造生产新纪录运动。沈阳团市委召集了全市工厂团的干部大会，由赵国有介绍创造新纪录中的初步经验；并建立重点工厂工作，深入领导，研究经验，介绍典型，发现问题，解决问题，给予团在运动中以具体及时的指导。从此，全市各国营工厂，凡是有团员的地方，便逐步开展了创造新纪录的运动。团员们一方面成为广大工友的鼓舞者，他们编写秧歌、大鼓书、写通讯并进行口头宣传等来讲解创新纪录的意义，打破部分保守工人不愿创造与怕创造了新纪录工厂一定要裁人的顾虑，推动与鼓励工人们去创造新纪录；另一方面，团员们自己热烈地投入了创造新纪录的运动中：有技术的团员积极钻研创造，如五四工厂团员岳振山等，连创四次新纪录；有的徒工团员帮助与鼓动师傅创造，如机器一厂团员王学根动员师傅创造新纪录，结果师徒均获得成就，同上红榜；有的团员则参加集体创造，如电机厂车工一组，全组集体创造了新纪录，在全厂获得模范组称号。
    在今年第一季度（一月至三月）的生产任务中，青年团围绕着党与政府提出的生产工作中心，积极参加了标订定额，订立联系合同与集体合同等工作，并展开订立师徒合同，发动团员和青年工人学习技术，进一步推动了群众性的创造生产新纪录运动，如第五机器厂团员佟俊山，三月十二日创造了车光杠从定额三小时提高到五十分钟，到三月二十九号又从五十分提高到三十四分钟。
    团员们在创新纪录运动中，也产生过一些缺点，如有的团员自己创新纪录，不愿与工友合作，怕“人家创了新纪录不能表现自己”；有的徒工团员创新纪录要“与师傅比一比”，引起师傅不满；有不少徒工团员见技工不断出现新纪录，自己没信心，说：“没有技术创不了”；有的团员创纪录重量不重质；也有的工厂创了不少新纪录，却没完成生产任务；有的支部领导处于被动地位，不是主动地组织创造，而是一般号召，等待新纪录出现。这些缺点，团的领导机关在运动中已注意逐步纠正。
    目前，东北党和工业部已提出了第二季度的中心工作是建立责任制。沈市青年团已在这一中心工作中开始表现了作用，如化工厂团检查出十一种现象无人负责，东电一厂团支部向党、政、工会提出了八十一条合理化建议等。预料新纪录将从责任制基础上有进一步发展。青年团也将进一步发挥更大的作用。
