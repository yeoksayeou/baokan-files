　　Tangshan Steel Plant Refractory Material Shop Workers
    Support This Newspaper's Criticism of the Shop
    New Director Actively Leads Improvement Work
    [This newspaper, Tangshan News] Correspondent Li Hengshan reports: The workers of the Guye Refractory Material Shop of Tangshan Steel Plant, upon reading this newspaper's criticism of the shop's director Zheng Liangshi on May 20th (published on the second page of that day), all considered it very accurate. Worker Ma Shichang said, "The newspaper said what we didn't dare to say in the past." Chen Youqing said, "The Tangshan Labor Control Committee has decided to remove Zheng Liangshi from his post and investigate him. We firmly support this decision."
    After Zheng Liangshi was transferred from the shop, under the leadership of the newly appointed shop director and cadres at all levels, the work has gradually gotten back on track. A system of division of labor and responsibility and scientific operating methods have now been established. A Labor Control Subcommittee and a Rationalization Proposal Committee have been formed to implement democratic management and give play to the workers' enthusiasm. In addition, experts have become one with the workers, and the quality of products is improving day by day. The damage rate of finished products from Kiln No. 3 of the shop on April 28 was 21.7%. The damage rate of finished products from Kiln No. 5 on May 5 dropped to 6.7%. The damage rate of goods from Kiln No. 8 on May 19 was 7.21%.
    Because the quality is not yet 100% good, we are now conducting detailed research and improvements in material selection and processing.

　　唐山制钢厂耐火材料场职工
    拥护本报对该场批评
    新主任积极领导改进工作
    【本报唐山讯】通讯员李恒山报道：唐山制钢厂古冶耐火材料场职工，看到五月二十日本报对该场主任郑良士的批评（载当日第二版），都认为很正确。工友马士昌说：“过去我们不敢说的话，报纸都替我们说咧。”陈又青说：“唐山工管会通过把郑良士撤职查办。我们坚决拥护这个决议。”
    郑良士调离该场后，该场在新任场主任和各级干部领导下，工作已逐步走上轨道。现已建立分工负责制度，和科学的操作方法，并成立了工管分会与合理化建议委员会，实行民主管理，发挥了工友们的积极性。再加上专家已与工友打成了一片，产品质量日见提高。该场三号窑四月二十八日出的成品，损坏率占百分之二十一点七。五月五日五号窑的成品，损坏率降至百分之六点七。五月十九日八号窑出货损坏率为百分之七点二一。
    由于质量还不够百分之百的好，现在正在选料和加工方面精细研究、改进中。
