　　Tianjin Railway Bureau Factories and Stations Actively Carry Out Warehouse Inventory Work
    Discovering Usable Materials Valued at 300 Million Yuan
    [Report from this newspaper] The Tianjin Railway Bureau of the Ministry of Railways is actively deploying and implementing warehouse inventory work. After listening to Minister Teng's report on the national warehouse material inventory, allocation, and management, Deputy Director Liu of the bureau immediately convened responsible persons from various departments to convey and deploy the work. He instructed all departments to closely cooperate with the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the labor union, fully utilize factory management committees to establish vertical leadership relationships and horizontal responsibility systems, focusing on factories, stations, and sections. Attention should also be paid to undiscovered railway materials around factories, stations, and sections. Thanks to the leadership's attention, in-depth work at the grassroots level, and specific arrangements, several difficulties have been overcome, and the responsibility spirit of employees has been greatly enhanced. For example, in addition to employees' voluntary labor, the Dezhou Engineering Section mobilized 51 family members to participate in the sorting work. Some factories have launched rationalization proposals, saving man-hours; appropriate adjustments have been made to manpower, eliminating the phenomenon of insufficient or wasted manpower in some factories and stations. Currently, except for the Materials Factory and Nankou Machine Factory, which are slightly delayed due to special circumstances, all other factories, stations, and sections are likely to complete the inventory work ahead of schedule.
    During the inventory, the Suiyuan Telecommunications Section discovered various electrical meters on the roof, worth approximately 10 million RMB; the Nankou Materials Factory discovered 200 various usable train wheels among the stored scrap materials, worth approximately 20 million RMB; and over ten tons of tin and copper, worth approximately 270 million RMB. These three items alone are worth over 300 million RMB.

　　天津铁路局所属各厂站
    积极进行仓库清理工作     
    已查出可用物资计值三亿元
    【本报讯】铁道部天津铁路局积极布置执行仓库清理工作。该局刘副局长在听取滕部长关于全国仓库物资清查调配管理的报告后，即召集所属各部门负责人传达布置，着各部门密切配合党、团、工充分利用工厂管委会建立垂直的领导关系与纵横的负责制，将重点放在厂、站、段，并须注意厂、站、段周围未发现的铁路器材。此项工作由于领导上的重视，深入下层与具体布置，已克服了若干困难，大大提高了职工的负责精神。如德州工务段除职工义务劳动外，还发动了五十一个家属参加整理工作。有的厂开展了合理化建议节省了工时；适当调整了人力，免除了有些厂、站人力不足或人力浪费的现象。现除材料厂、南口机厂等单位因特殊情况稍延数日外，其余各厂、站、段都可能提前完成清理工作。
    在清理中，绥远电务段在房顶上发现各种电气表多只，约值人民币一千万元；南口材料厂在所存废料中发现各种可用车轮二百个，约值人民币二千余万元；生锡、铜十余吨，约值人民币两亿七千万元。仅此三项已值三亿元之多。
