　　How Are National Bank Deposits Increased?
　　Wang Jingran
    With the general stabilization of prices across the country and the increasing consolidation of the Renminbi's credit, bank deposits in various regions are increasing. This phenomenon should be said to be extremely natural. However, the rapid increase in bank deposits in various places over the past two months is also due to the subjective efforts of various banks and the improvement and adaptation of their business methods to the needs of the broad masses. Describing and introducing the existing business methods of banks in various places will be beneficial in exchanging experiences and improving work.
            A. The Diversity, Flexibility, and Practicality of Business Methods.
    This point should be extremely familiar to us. For example, in the past, when prices could not be stabilized, in order to prevent the masses from worrying about the depreciation of their deposits due to price fluctuations, we launched real value deposits. Now that prices are stable, we are launching currency deposits. If depositors find it temporarily difficult to determine whether the price trend is upward or downward, they can deposit capital-protected and value-guaranteed deposits (real value principal and interest if prices rise, currency principal and interest if prices fall). This is one type. Secondly, for short-term needs, there are seven-day and half-month fixed deposits, and for long-term needs, there are half-year, one-year, and even two-year fixed deposits. For those who want to withdraw in installments while earning higher interest, there are current and fixed deposits. This is another type. Thirdly, for those who want to deposit and withdraw in one lump sum, there are lump-sum deposits and withdrawals; for those who want to deposit in one lump sum and withdraw in installments, there are lump-sum deposits and installment withdrawals; for those who want to deposit in installments and withdraw in one lump sum, there are installment deposits and lump-sum withdrawals; for those who want to spend only the interest on fixed deposits, there are deposits with interest paid on the principal. In addition, there are special services such as real value deposit transfer for students to pay tuition fees (Tianjin); pre-deposited currency tax payment deposits that can be converted to real value (Nanjing); living deposits for convenient daily needs (Shanghai); group real value savings to meet the needs of organizations (Shanghai); and special real value savings to facilitate the needs of workers and students, etc. There are many types to choose from. Such business methods should be considered very convenient for depositors.
            B. Improvement and Enhancement of Systems, Procedures, and Work Efficiency.
    At the beginning of the deposit work deployment, the National Financial Conference considered that the main reason why a considerable number of people were unwilling to deposit in national banks in the past was that they disliked the cumbersome procedures, slow handling, long waiting times, and excessive delays. If effective improvements could not be made in this regard, even if other conditions were better, deposits might not increase quickly. Therefore, the conference emphasized reminding everyone to pay attention to this point, and in practice, various regions made great efforts, resulting in many achievements. Specific practices include: First, in terms of time allocation, Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Nanjing, and other places adopted a Sunday (morning of holidays) rotation system, and extended office hours internally on weekdays (Beijing from 7:30 am to 10:00 pm) or day and night shifts. Deposited funds can be withdrawn at any time, which depositors are very satisfied with. Second, strengthen and improve teller work to improve the efficiency of handling procedures and counting votes. For example, propose a ten-minute movement (Hankou, Ningbo) and a five-minute movement (Shanghai), stipulating that deposit procedures should be completed within ten minutes or five minutes. Or implement a small teller system (Wuxi, Nanjing), a dedicated teller counter system (Zhejiang), and divide deposit and collection counters (Tianjin) to facilitate the counting of deposits, greatly saving depositors' unnecessary waiting time. As a result, according to a report from the Nanyang branch of the Bank of Henan, the time it originally took to count money, which was half an hour to an hour, has been reduced to only ten to twenty minutes. Depositors therefore praised it greatly.
            C. Launch a Movement to Attract Depositors.
    After the task of attracting deposits was issued, many places greeted it with a fighting posture. Some set their own inspection systems and launched a widespread movement to win over depositors. For example, in late April, Shanghai launched the Spring Savings Movement on the basis of last year's 100,000 depositors movement. Beijing launched a deposit competition movement on April 14. Hankou proposed a 20,000 basic depositors movement, and Bengbu launched a 1,000 household movement in April. For example, a unit in Tianjin proposed the slogan "Three to five million is not too little, one hundred and eighty million is not too much." It also clearly stipulated the responsibilities of internal and external staff. The external staff is responsible for attracting new depositors; the internal staff should be responsible for "mid-term sleep" (depositors who do not continue to deposit after an initial deposit to cover expenses) or if the depositor leaves. After a period of effort, the tasks were generally overfulfilled. For example, according to the statistics of the Beijing Branch as of April 20, the average completion rate of deposit absorption for private enterprises and individuals by the 14 affiliated units reached 242.8%, with the West Chang'an Street Office being the highest, reaching more than 14 times. After the Chahar Branch implemented a two-time inspection and reporting system for the external work team, the amount of deposits increased from 600 million to 1.8 billion. In Wuxi, on April 21, five staff members received deposits totaling 1.1 billion, overfulfilling the deposit task of 150,000 public bonds. The Tianjin Branch proposed a deposit task and launched rationalization proposals. Within March and April, employees put forward 45 rationalization proposals for deposit work, which provided a strong guarantee for the completion of the task.
            D. Existing Problems and Future Efforts.
    Although a comprehensive summary of the deposit business in the country during this period has not yet been made, the following issues are worth noting:
    First, whether the foundation of deposit work is solid requires us to study and work harder. The initial achievements of the current deposit work are quite significant, but many depositors have clearly seen the trend of future price stability and are prepared to save for a certain period of time, while many others still lack confidence in price stability and are prepared to withdraw deposits at any time and make other plans. Of course, it is not hoped that all deposited funds will become fixed deposits and be used permanently for our planned key support for production. However, according to the deposit motivation analysis of the Zhengzhou City Bank in March, 60% of the depositors intend to be able to obtain overdrafts from the national bank. Therefore, in the future, in addition to making scientific analyses and reserving a certain percentage for withdrawals, we must further strive on the existing basis to attract deposits more widely and on a larger scale in order to adapt to the continuous flow. That is to say, in the future, we should not breathe a sigh of relief, but rather go further.
    Second, in terms of tasks, from the current situation, it seems that the foundation for the whole year has been laid. If there are no accidents, there will be no problems. However, completing the deposit amount does not mean that the task has been fully completed. As the Financial Conference has told us, and as Director Nan has instructed, the bank's overall task is to support production and develop production. Receiving deposits is only the first step in the work. Therefore, at this time, one should not be complacent and should be vigilant, steady, and progressive, moving towards more service to the people.
    Third, it is important to be good at discovering weaknesses in work and overcome or solve them in a timely manner, which is of great help to the work. A person in charge of a sub-branch under the Tianjin Branch discovered that when a depositor whose deposit amount accounted for about 80% of the total deposit amount of the sub-branch wanted to withdraw all the funds and close the account one day, he promptly inquired about the reason. As a result, the depositor had some minor opinions on the teller of the sub-branch. After the director of the sub-branch sincerely and humbly solicited opinions and properly resolved the issue, the depositor not only did not withdraw the funds but also continued to deposit a part. Similarly, some staff members treated customers with a rude attitude, causing losses to the work. These things may seem trivial, but often it is because these trivial things cannot be corrected in a timely manner that serious bureaucracy is created. Therefore, it should attract the constant attention of leaders at all levels.

　　国家银行的存款是怎样增加起来的？
　　王静然
    伴随着全国物价的普遍稳定，人民币信用的日益巩固，各地银行存款在增加着。这种现象应该说是极其自然的。不过，两月来各地银行存款能增加得这样快，各银行主观上的努力与业务方式的改善和适应了广大群众的要求，也是极其重要的因素之一。今就各地银行现有的业务方式加以叙述和介绍，在交流经验，改进工作上将有所裨益。
            甲、业务方式的多样性、灵活性与现实性。
    这一条应该是我们极其熟悉的，如过去物价不可能稳定的时期，为使群众免除害怕物价波动而使存款贬值的顾虑，我们举办了折实存款，现在物价稳定了，我们就举办货币存款；若一时尚难判定物价趋势是上涨或下落的存户，他们可以存保本保值存款（上涨折实取本息、下落货币取本息）这是一类。其次，如短期需用的有七天、半月的定存，长期需用的又有半年、一年甚至二年的定存，既想分次取用、又想获取较高利息的，又有定活两便存款。这又是一类。第三，如想干脆一次存入、一次提取的，有整存整取；想一次存入、分次取用的有整存零取；想分次存入、一次提取的，有零存整取；想只在固定存款上花用利息部分的，又有存本付息。此外，还有如专为学生缴纳学费举办的代收学费转存折实（天津）；专为缴纳税款举办的预存货币缴税存款，可转折实（南京）；专为便利生活需用的生活存款（上海）；适应团体需要的集团折实储蓄（上海）；和为便利职工、学生需要的特种折实储蓄等等。多种多样，任凭选择。像这样的业务方式，对于存款户来说，不能不算是很方便了。
            乙、制度、手续与工作效率的改进与提高。
    在存款工作布置之初，全国金融会议考虑到以往有相当一部分人所以不愿到国家银行存款的主要原因，就是嫌手续麻烦，办事迟缓，等候时间过长，耽误功夫太大。如果不能对此作有效的改进，即使其他条件再好，存款还是不一定很快增加。因之在会上着重提醒大家重视这一点，实践中各地均作了极大的努力，结果是获致了不少成绩。具体作法如：一、在时间的调配上，上海、天津、北京、南京等各地采取了星期日（例假日上午）轮班制，平日内部延长办公时间（北京是上午七时半至晚十时）或昼夜轮值。存入之款，可以随时支取，存户就大感满意。二、加强与改进出纳工作，提高办手续及点票效率。如提出十分钟运动（汉口、宁波），五分钟运动（上海），规定在十分钟或五分钟以内办完存款手续。或者实行小出纳制度（无锡，南京），出纳专柜制度（浙江），划分存款与代收柜台（天津），便利存款之清点，均大大的节省了存户不必要的等候时间。结果，据河南南阳支行报告，该行原来点款需要半点钟、一点钟的，提高到只需十分钟、二十分钟即可。存户因此极为称赞。
            丙、展开吸收存户运动。
    吸收存款的任务下达后，许多地方是以战斗姿态来迎接的。有的自定了检查制度，还掀起了广泛的争取存户运动。如上海在四月下旬，于去年十万存户运动的基础上，复又展开了春季储蓄运动。北京四月十四日起，开展了存款竞赛运动。汉口提出了二万基本存户运动，以及蚌埠在四月间展开了千户运动等。又如天津一个单位提出“三万五万不嫌少，百八十万不为多”等口号。并明确规定内外勤责任，吸收进来归外勤；“中途睡眠”（存户为了支应一次存入后不续存）或来了以后又顶走则内勤应负责。经过一段时间的努力，一般的都超额完成了任务。如北京分行截止四月二十日的统计，对私营企业及个人部分的存款吸收，所属十四个单位，即平均完成任务达百分之二四二·八，其中以西长安街办事处为最高，达到十四倍以上。察哈尔分行对外勤小组两次实行检查汇报制度后，存款额数由六亿增加到十八亿。无锡四月二十一日一天中，五个工作人员即收存金额达十一亿许，把十五万公债分的存款任务超额完成。天津分行提出了存款任务又发动了合理化建议，三四月份之内，职员提出之存款工作合理建议即达四十五件，都给任务之完成提供了有力的保证。
            丁、存在的问题以及今后应有的努力。
    对于全国这一个时期的存款业务，虽然还未能作出全面总结，但下面几个问题是值得引起注意的：
    一、存款工作的基础是否巩固，需要我们很好加以研究和进一步努力。目前存款工作初步获得的成绩是相当巨大的，但存户中固有不少人是看清了今后物价必然稳定的趋势，准备一定时间储存的，而其中也还有不少人仍对物价稳定缺乏信心，准备随时提出存款，另作打算。当然并不希望已存之款全成定存性质，永供我们有计划的重点扶植生产之用。但是，根据郑州市行三月份的存款动机分析，其中有百分之六十的户数是打算能在国家银行中得到透支的。因此，我们今后除经过科学分析留备一定成数供提存之外，还须在已有基础上进一步努力，更广泛地更大批地揽收存款，以能适应川流不息。就是说，今后不是松一口气，而是百尺竿头更进一步。
    二、在任务上说，就现在情况来看，似乎全年基础都已打下，如没有什么意外，不会有什么问题。但是完成了收存款的数字，并非已全部完成任务。正如金融会议已告诉了我们，也正如南行长所指示的，银行总的任务是扶助生产，发展生产，收进了存款只不过作了工作的第一步。因此在这个时候就一点也不能自满自足，应该足够警惕，稳步渐进，朝向更多的服务于人民。
    三、要善于发现工作中的弱点，及时克服或加以解决，这对工作的帮助是大的。天津分行所属办事处下一个分理处，负责人于发现一户存款额占该处总存金额百分之八十左右的存款户，一天要取清款销户的时候，他就及时追问原因，结果是该提款人对该处出纳人员有些小意见。后经该分理处主任诚恳虚心征询意见，适当加以解决后，该户即不但不提款而且续存了一部。同样的，另外有的工作人员对待顾客态度生硬，给工作招致了损失。这些事情看来似乎均属琐事，但往往就因为这些琐事不能得到及时纠正，造成严重的官僚主义。因此，应引起各级负责人的经常注意。
