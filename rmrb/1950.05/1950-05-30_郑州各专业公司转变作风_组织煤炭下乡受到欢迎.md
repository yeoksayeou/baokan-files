　　Zhengzhou Specialized Companies Change Their Style
    Organizing Coal to Go to the Countryside is Welcomed
    [Our Newspaper Zhengzhou News] After the Central Trade Department inspection team and the Southwest Military and Political Committee pointed out the existence of serious bureaucratic style, the state-owned specialized companies in Zhengzhou launched a campaign against bureaucratic style. In the past, the business operation methods of the city's specialized companies focused on purchasing rather than promoting sales, wholesale rather than retail, and stipulated many procedures that were not suitable for customer requirements. The business personnel were not only unfamiliar with the technology, but also spoke harshly to customers, which affected the sales work. After vigorous overcoming and thorough rectification, the sales work has made significant progress. For example, the cotton yarn and cloth company sold more than 170 pieces of cloth in one day on May 12. At the same time, it began to exchange yarn for cotton, selling 3,200 pieces of cloth in ten days, 5,153 bundles of yarn, and exchanging for more than 2,237 dan of cotton. During the "May 1st" and "May 4th" discount periods, the department store, in order to strengthen the power of the business department and strive to establish good relations with workers, citizens, and various agencies, troops, groups, and schools, and to facilitate the purchase of goods, temporarily transferred internal office personnel to various stores to serve customers and assist in shipping goods. The Coal and Building Materials Company organized coal to go to the countryside, which has been warmly welcomed and helped by the masses. The average daily sales in half a month reached 22,000 jin. The peasants are generally happy because they can buy coal nearby, saving time for other production and saving firewood for fertilizer. They said happily: "We don't have to pull coal from far away anymore, saving time to work in the fields."

　　郑州各专业公司转变作风
    组织煤炭下乡受到欢迎
    【本报郑州讯】郑州市国营各专业公司在中央贸易部检查团及西南军政委员会指出存在着严重的官僚主义作风后，即展开了反官僚主义作风的运动。该市各专业公司业务经营方式，过去多重收购不重推销，整卖而不零售，还规定了许多不适合顾客要求的手续。业务员技术既生疏，对顾客说话又生硬，致影响了推销工作。经大力克服，彻底整顿后，推销工作已有了显著成绩。如花纱布公司推销布匹在五月十二日一天中即达一百七十多匹。同时开始以纱换花，一旬中计销出布匹三千二百匹。纱五千一百五十三捆，换进棉花二千二百三十七担多。百货公司在“五一”“五四”减价期中，为了加强营业部力量，并争取与工人、市民暨各机关、部队、团体、学校建立良好关系，便利购买货物，特将内部办公人员临时调配到各门市部担任招待顾主及协助出货等工作。煤业建筑器材公司组织煤炭下乡，已受到群众热情的欢迎与帮助，半月中平均每天卖出二万二千斤。农民们因为可以就近买煤，省下工夫来搞其他生产，省下柴草作肥料，普遍高兴地说：“我们不到远处拉煤啦，省下时间，好在地里做活了。”
