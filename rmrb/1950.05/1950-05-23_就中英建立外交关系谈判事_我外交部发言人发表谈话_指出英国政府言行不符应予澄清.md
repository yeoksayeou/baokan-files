Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd: A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China today issued a statement regarding the negotiations between China and the UK for the establishment of diplomatic relations, as follows:

On January 6, 1950, the British government sent a note to Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, expressing its willingness to establish diplomatic relations with the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. On the same day, the British government also declared the withdrawal of its diplomatic recognition of the remnant clique of the Chinese Kuomintang reactionaries. Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, responded to this note from the British government on January 9, expressing his willingness to establish diplomatic relations between China and the UK on the basis of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect for territorial sovereignty. On January 28, he accepted Mr. Hutchison, the chargé d'affaires ad interim appointed by the British government, as a representative to come to Beijing to hold preliminary negotiations on issues of procedure regarding the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the UK.

After Representative Hutchison arrived in Beijing, negotiations on the issue of establishing diplomatic relations between China and the UK formally began on March 2. During the negotiations, our side orally raised the issue with the British negotiating representatives that, regarding the preliminary and procedural issues of establishing diplomatic relations between China and the UK, the most important issue that must be resolved first is the relationship between the British government and the remnant clique of the Chinese Kuomintang reactionaries. Our Central People's Government believes that the British representative's abstention vote in the United Nations on the issue of Chinese representation, as well as the attitude of the British government towards the various institutions of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique in the UK, Hong Kong, and British territories, and towards China's national property, all fall under the issue of the British government's relationship with the Chinese Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique. Therefore, our Central People's Government hopes that the British government will clarify these two issues.

On March 17, the British government, through Representative Hutchison, presented its oral reply, explaining the British government's attitude on the above two issues. Our side considers this explanation unsatisfactory. In fact, the British government has consistently abstained from voting on the issue of Chinese representation in all United Nations affiliated organizations for five months. Furthermore, the British authorities in Hong Kong have repeatedly hindered the take-off and return of aircraft directly held by the China and Central Aviation Companies, which are under the jurisdiction of the Civil Aviation Administration of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, and have failed to genuinely protect them, resulting in the destruction of seven of them. All these facts are sufficient to prove that the British government has failed to express, through practical actions, that it has completely severed relations with the remnant clique of the Chinese Kuomintang reactionaries and has fully respected the national property and the right to dispose of property of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.

Therefore, our Central People's Government specifically notified Representative Hutchison on May 8 to convey to the British government a request for further clarification on the following two issues: the issue of Chinese representation in the United Nations and the issue of Chinese national property rights in Hong Kong.

However, the day after our Central People's Government issued the above notice, on May 9, the British government actually ordered the Hong Kong court to impound seventy aircraft belonging to the China and Central Aviation Companies parked at Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong. This action not only proves that the British government does not respect our Central People's Government's national property rights and right to dispose of property but is also a manifestation of an extremely unfriendly attitude towards our People's Republic of China. The British government expresses its desire to establish diplomatic relations between China and the UK on the one hand, but on the other hand, after expressing this desire, it repeatedly demonstrates in fact that it has not completely severed relations with the remnant clique of the Chinese Kuomintang reactionaries. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China believes that it is absolutely necessary to request the British government to further clarify this central issue of inconsistency between words and actions.

　　就中英建立外交关系谈判事
    我外交部发言人发表谈话
    指出英国政府言行不符应予澄清
    【新华社二十二日讯】中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部发言人于本日就中英两国建立外交关系谈判事，发表谈话如次：
    一九五○年一月六日，英国政府照会中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长，表示愿在平等、互利及互相尊重领土主权的基础上，与中华人民共和国中央人民政府建立外交关系；英国政府并于同日声明，撤销其对中国国民党反动派残余集团的外交承认。中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部周恩来部长于一月九日对英国政府此项照会提出答复，表示愿在平等、互利及互相尊重领土主权的基础上，与英国政府建立中英两国之间的外交关系，并于一月廿八日接受英国政府所指派的临时代办胡阶森先生为前来北京就中英两国建立外交关系之初步的与程序的问题举行谈判的代表。
    胡阶森代表抵达北京后，中英建立外交关系问题的谈判即于三月二日正式开始。我方曾在谈判中，口头上向英国谈判代表提出：关于中英两国建立外交关系之初步的与程序的问题，其中最重要与必须先行解决者，为英国政府与中国国民党反动派残余的关系的问题。我中央人民政府认为：英国代表在联合国关于中国代表权的问题上投弃权票的行动，以及英国政府对于在英国、香港和英国属地之国民党反动派残余集团的各种机构及中国的国家财产究持何种态度的问题，都属于英国政府与中国国民党反动派残余的关系的问题。因此，我中央人民政府希望英国政府就这两个问题予以澄清。
    英国政府于三月十七日经由胡阶森代表提出其口头答复，对于英国政府关于上述两问题之态度，有所解释。此项解释，我方认为不能满意。事实上，英国政府五个月来在联合国所属一切机构中对中国代表权问题一贯投弃权票；而对现在香港为中华人民共和国中央人民政府民航局所属中国、中央两航空公司所直接保有的飞机，香港英国当局既多方阻难其起飞返回，又不真正负责保护，以致其中七架遭受破坏。凡此事实，均足证明英国政府未能以实际行动表示其确已与中国国民党反动派残余集团完全断绝关系，并对中华人民共和国中央人民政府国家产权及财产处置权充分予以尊重。
    因此，我中央人民政府特于五月八日通知胡阶森代表转达英国政府，请其就以下两问题，即联合国中国代表权问题及在香港的中国国家财产权问题，再行进一步予以澄清。
    乃在我中央人民政府提出上项通知之次日，即五月九日，英国政府竟下令香港法院扣押中国、中央两航空公司停放在香港启德飞机场之七十架飞机。这一行动，不仅证明英国政府对我中央人民政府之国家产权及财产处置权并不尊重，且实为对我中华人民共和国极不友好的态度的表现。英国政府一方面表示与中华人民共和国中央人民政府建立中英间外交关系的愿望，另一方面在表示此种愿望之后，又在事实上一再表现对中国国民党反动派残余集团并未完全断绝关系。中华人民共和国中央人民政府认为请英国政府对这种言行不符之中心问题，再进一步予以澄清，实属完全必要。
