The Zhoushan Archipelago is located in the East China Sea, at the confluence of the Qiantang River and the Yangtze River estuary. It is a strategic location for national defense and an important naval base. After the basic liberation of mainland China, the Kuomintang remnants used Zhoushan, Kinmen, and Hainan Islands, along with Taiwan, as mutually supporting strongholds, attempting to hold out in the islands and prolong their existence. After the successive liberation of Hainan Island and the Zhoushan Archipelago, Taiwan lost the protection of its wings and became even more isolated. The "blockade" of Shanghai by the remnants based in Zhoushan was thus completely broken.

The Zhoushan Archipelago is a collective name for more than 300 islands of varying sizes, with Zhoushan Island being the largest, about 90 li long from east to west and 60 li wide from north to south. The county seat of Dinghai is located on it. The next largest are Daishan, Jintang, Liuheng, Taohua, and Qushan islands, each ranging from 20 to 30 li in length and width. The remaining islands range in size from several li to just over one li. The archipelago has a population of approximately 470,000, mostly fishermen. The islands are rich in fish and salt. In the past, during peak seasons, there were four fishing seasons annually, with a total of more than 12,000 fishing vessels from both local and out-of-town groups, producing an average of more than 30 million jin of fish annually, especially yellow croaker. Shenjiamen, southeast of Zhoushan Island, is one of the three major fishing markets in the Far East. The total annual salt production of the islands reaches more than 95 million jin, with Daishan producing the most, reaching 55 million jin annually.

Historically, the Zhoushan Archipelago has been repeatedly occupied by imperialists as a springboard for invading mainland China. During the Jiajing era of the Ming Dynasty, Japanese pirates plundered Jintang, Zhoushan, and other islands, causing great harm. During the Daoguang era of the Qing Dynasty, the Opium War broke out, and British imperialists twice captured the Dinghai County area. In the tenth year of Xianfeng, the Anglo-French Allied Forces occupied Dinghai County for four months. In 1939, Japanese imperialists invaded and occupied Dinghai, building military facilities such as airfields, naval docks, and highways on the island, making the Zhoushan Archipelago an important military location in eastern Zhejiang. After Japan's surrender, the archipelago was first taken over by American imperialists and handed over to the KMT navy.

Since April of last year, the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River to the south and quickly liberated the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The Kuomintang bandits in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, except for those who were annihilated, fled to the islands. Due to the sudden increase in population on the islands, there was a shortage of food, and the sea was blockaded by the remnants, leaving hundreds of thousands of fishermen in a state of hunger and destitution. The bandit army further imposed heavy taxes and levies, allocating firewood, grass, and vegetables to each household. The people on the islands, unable to bear the ravages of the bandits, rose up in resistance, constantly killing bandit agents and demanding that the People's Liberation Army advance as soon as possible.

Since the People's Liberation Army liberated the Xiangshan Peninsula in August of last year, it has successively liberated Daxie, Jintang, Liuheng, Xiazhi, Taohua, and other islands, directly threatening the main nest of the remnants, Zhoushan Island. The remnants, fearing the coming of their end, were restless day and night and built multiple layers of fortifications on Zhoushan Island, attempting to hold on firmly; but ultimately, they were intimidated by the great power of our army and fled in panic.

　　舟山群岛介绍
    舟山群岛在东海中钱塘江与长江口交会处，是国防战略要地与海上重要军事基地。我国大陆基本上全部解放后，国民党残匪即以舟山、金门、海南诸岛与台湾互为犄角，妄图负隅海岛，苟延残喘。海南岛、舟山群岛相继解放后，台湾即失去了两翼的屏障，越发陷于孤立。残匪以舟山为基地的对我上海“封锁”，至此完全被打破了。
    舟山群岛是大小三百多个岛屿的总称，其中以舟山岛为最大，东西长约九十里，南北宽六十里，定海县城即在其上。其次为岱山、金塘、六横、桃花、衢山等岛，长阔均在二三十里以上。其余则均为数里以至里许大小的小岛。群岛人口共约四十七万余人，大部是渔民。岛上盛产鱼盐。过去极盛时期，每年渔汛四期，放洋渔船本客帮共达一万二千余艘，年产鱼平均约三千多万斤，尤以黄鱼为最多。舟山岛东南之沉家门为远东三大渔市之一。各岛产盐总额年达九千五百余万斤，其中以岱山为最多，年产达五千五百余万斤。
    在历史上舟山群岛曾屡被帝国主义霸占，作为侵略中国大陆的跳板。明朝嘉靖年间，倭寇劫掠金塘、舟山等岛，为患甚烈。清道光年间，鸦片战争爆发，英帝国主义曾两度攻陷定海县境。咸丰十年，英法帝国主义联军又盘据定海县城四个月。一九三九年日本帝国主义侵占定海，即在岛上修建飞机场、海军码头、公路等军事设备，舟山群岛遂成为浙东军事要地。日本投降后，该群岛先由美帝国主义接收，交匪海军驻守。
    去年四月，人民解放军渡江南下，迅速解放江浙等省。长江下游国民党匪帮，除大部被歼灭外，侥幸逃脱之残匪即逃窜岛上。岛上由于人口突增，粮食困难，海面又遭残匪封锁，数十万渔民陷于饥寒困苦的绝境。而匪军更横征暴敛，柴草青菜，无不按户摊派。岛上人民不堪匪帮蹂躏，纷起反抗，曾不断击杀匪军特务，要求人民解放军早日进军。
    人民解放军自去年八月解放象山半岛后，即先后解放大榭、金塘、六横、虾峙、桃花诸岛，直逼残匪之主要巢穴舟山本岛。残匪惧于末日将临，日夜不安，乃在舟山本岛构筑多层工事，妄图固守；但终慑于我军之强大威力，乃慌忙逃窜。
