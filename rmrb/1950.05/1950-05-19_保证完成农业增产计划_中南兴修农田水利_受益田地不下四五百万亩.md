Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 17th: Farmers in various parts of the Central South region, under the strong leadership and assistance of the People's Government, have been actively digging rivers, opening canals, repairing ponds, building dams, and constructing farmland irrigation and water conservancy projects since the beginning of spring, in order to guarantee the completion of the 1950 agricultural production increase plan. The Jiangxi Provincial People's Government has loaned 4.92 million *jin* of rice to finance the construction of 2,460 small-scale farmland irrigation projects in various counties, including the construction or repair of existing reservoirs, ponds, dams, slopes, weirs, and ditches. It is estimated that the province can increase rice production by 147,600 *shi*. The spring irrigation projects in various counties of the Ji'an Special District of the province have been largely completed, with a total of 113 reservoirs, slopes, dams, ponds, and dikes being constructed or repaired, benefiting 212,400 *mu* of land. The Anfu Canal Roller Dam, constructed by the Jiangxi Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau, is the largest water conservancy project in the province and was completed in early February. It is estimated that the total irrigation area reaches 39,000 *mu*, with an annual increase in rice production of at least 39,000 *dan*.

In Henan Province, the seven counties of Baofeng and Lushan in the Xuchang Special District, which have already completed land reform, have dug 88 rivers and canals since the beginning of spring, rescuing more than 102,000 *mu* of flooded fields, and are expected to increase grain production by more than 3.6 million *jin* this year. The 92-li long river dredging project in the Chenliu Special District, originally planned to be completed in one month, was completed in half a month, rescuing 170,000 *mu* of land. The Shangqiu Special District mobilized more than 230,000 laborers to manage rivers, and by the end of March, 38 rivers had been dredged, which can protect more than 490,000 *mu* of land from floods and increase grain production by 30 million *jin*.

In Hunan Province, the drainage and sluice gate repair project in the Yongzhou Special District has been completed. In addition to preventing waterlogging of 800 *mu* of rice paddies, it can also increase fertile land by 1,000 *mu*, which is expected to increase rice production by 400,000 *jin* this year. Pingjiang County has repaired 732 ponds, weirs, and other facilities, which can increase rice production by more than 20,000 *shi*.

Hubei Province is expected to build 13 large-scale canals and weirs this year, and also strive to achieve one pond per village. As a result of the water conservancy construction movement launched in Xiangyang County in April, 200,000 *mu* of land can be protected from floods, more than 20,000 *mu* of paddy fields can be irrigated, and more than 6,000 *mu* of dry land has been transformed into paddy fields. In Mianyang County, various districts opened ditches to drain water, rescuing a total of 100,000 *mu* of fertile land.

The largest water conservancy project in South China, the Lubaobao Sluice Gate in Sanshui, Guangdong, is also under construction. After the sluice gate is completed, it can protect more than 3 million *mu* of fertile land from floods.

　　保证完成农业增产计划
　　中南兴修农田水利         
　　受益田地不下四五百万亩
    【新华社汉口十七日电】中南区各地农民，在人民政府的大力领导与扶助下，入春以来，纷纷挖河、开渠、修塘、筑坝和兴修农田水利，以保证完成一九五○年的农业增产计划。江西省人民政府贷放大米四百九十二万市斤以兴修各县小型农田水利工程二千四百六十座，包括新建或修筑旧有之水库、塘坝、坡堰、沟渠等，预计全省可增产稻谷十四万七千六百石。该省吉安专区各县的春修水利工程现已大部完成，共兴修水库、坡、坝、塘及圩堤一百十三座，受益田二十一万二千四百亩。江西省水利局兴修的安福渠滚水坝为该省最大的一座水利工程，已于二月上旬完成。估计总灌溉面积达三万九千亩，每年增产稻谷至少三万九千担。
    河南省许昌专区业已完成土地改革的宝丰、鲁山等七个县，入春以来已修挖河渠八十八条，救出被淹田十万二千余亩，今年可增产粮食三百六十余万斤。陈留专区原计划一个月完成的九十二里长的河流疏浚工程，半月即告竣工，救出土地十七万亩。商邱专区动员民工二十三万余人治河，在三月底以前即疏通河流三十八条，可使四十九万余亩土地免除水灾，可增产粮食三千万斤。
    湖南省永州专区的排水修闸工程业已竣工，除免除八百亩稻田的水灾外，尚可增加良田一千亩，本年约可增产稻谷四十万斤。平江县已修好塘堰等七百三十二处，可增产稻谷两万石以上。
    湖北省今年预计修建大型渠、堰十三座，另外争取作到一村一塘。该省襄阳县在四月间展开兴修水利运动的结果，可使二十万亩地免除水灾，二万多亩水田获得灌溉，并使六千多亩旱田变成了水田。沔阳县各区开沟放水，共救出良田十万亩。
    华南最大水利工程广东三水芦苞水闸亦正在修建中。该闸修竣后，可使三百余万亩良田免除水患。
