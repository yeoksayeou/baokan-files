　　Introduction to Several Grain Storage Inspection Tools
　　Gao Wenbin
    Grain storage inspection tools are needed everywhere. Here are brief introductions to several:
    1.  Bagged Grain Sampler. This tool is 6.8 inches long, with an inlet diameter of 0.3 inches at the top and 0.6 inches at the bottom, shaped like a long cone. It is made of iron or steel and has a smooth surface. This tool is specifically used for sampling grain from burlap bags. After insertion into the bag, grain flows in from point A and out from point B.
    2.  Bulk Grain Sampler. This tool is made of iron or steel, 2.8 feet long, and consists of two tubes nested together: the inner tube is connected to a handle at the top and has a diameter of 0.55 inches; the outer tube has a diameter of 0.65 inches. When using, rotate handle A to first turn the inlet of the inner tube to the inside to close it, then insert it into the grain pile. Then, rotate the handle again to align the inlet of the inner tube with the inlet of the outer tube. At this time, the inlet is open, and grain can flow in. Then, it can be pulled out from the grain pile. The advantage of this tool is that it can sample grain from all layers simultaneously, but its length is sometimes insufficient, which is its disadvantage.
    3.  Single Sampler One: This tool is 3.9 inches long, 1 inch in diameter, and conical in shape, made of wrought iron or steel. Point A is fitted with a handle, and the length of the handle can be increased or decreased as needed. This tool can be inserted vertically or horizontally from the bottom of the storage into the grain. After inserting into the grain, points B and C are joined, and the opening D closes automatically. Insert to the required depth and lift upwards, the contact surface of B and C will then separate and grain can flow in through inlet D. Then, remove the tool from the grain pile and pour out the grain. This tool can be made by village blacksmiths and is used for sampling wheat, beans, rice, etc.
    4.  Single Sampler Two. This tool is simpler than the previous one, consisting of only a curved, conical iron tube, 3.5 inches long, with a width of 1 inch at handle A. Figure 1 shows the shape when inserted into the grain pile, at which time the gate B is closed. Figure 2 shows the shape when pulled out of the grain pile, at which time the gate B falls down. When using, first return the gate B to the position shown in Figure 4B, forcefully insert it into the grain pile to the desired depth, and pull it outwards. The gate B is blocked by the grain and falls down, allowing grain to flow in through the inlet.
    5.  Hand Mill. This tool consists of two convex and concave round disks joined together, made of wood. The joining surfaces of the two disks are engraved with grinding teeth like a flour mill. This tool is 4 inches in diameter and 1 inch high. When using, lift the upper disk A, put in the sampled grain, and put the upper disk back on. Hold the bottom disk B with your left hand and rotate the upper disk A with your right hand. If the grain put in is rice, then if there is little breakage after grinding, it is dry; if the color is pure, it is not mixed; if the color is yellow, it has been heated (commonly known as "burning the warehouse"); if there are broken rice husks, broken rice, insect droppings, or insects, it has been infested with insects.

　　介绍几种检验储粮的器具
　　高文彬
    检验储粮的器具，各地都很需要，兹特简要介绍几种于下：
    一、袋粮扦取器。该器长六市寸八分，入谷口上端直径三分，下端直径六分，长角锥状，用铁或钢制造，表面要光滑。该器专用扦取麻袋里的粮食，插入袋后，袋里的粮食由甲处流入，乙处流出。
    二、散堆粮扦取器。该器用铁或钢制，长二市尺八寸，由二管套成：内管上端连把柄，直径五分五；外管直径六分五。用时转动把柄甲，先将内管各入谷口转到里面闭住插入谷堆后，再转动把柄，将内管入谷口转到与外管入谷口恰相重合的位置。此时入谷口开放，谷得流入；继可从粮堆里拔出。本器的优点能同时扦取各层的储粮，但长度有时尚不够用，这是它的缺点。
    三、单式扦取器之一；该器长三寸九分，直径一寸，圆锥形，用熟铁或钢制成。甲处装柄，按需要可增减柄的长短。该器纵插或由仓底横插入储粮都可。插入储粮后，乙丙两处相接合，洞口丁自行关闭，插到须要的深度，往上提动，乙丙接触面此时离开粮食即可经丁处入谷口流入。再将该器由粮堆拔出，倾出粮食。该器乡间铁匠炉都可制，用于扦取小麦、豆类、稻子等。
    四、单式扦取器之二。该器较前种更简单，仅一弯嘴角锥形铁筒，长三寸五分，把柄甲处宽一寸。图１、系插入粮堆的形状，此时活门乙关闭。图２、系由粮堆抽出时的形状，此时活门乙落下，用时先将活门乙放回如附图四乙图状，用力插入谷堆，至所要深度，向外抽动，活门乙被谷阻落，谷遂得由入谷口流入。
    五、手砻。该器系由凸凹的上下二圆盘相接合而成，木制，二圆盘接合面刻有如面磨的磨齿。该器直径四寸，高一寸，用时掀取上盘甲，放入扦出的储粮，重新放回上盘，以右手托住底盘乙，右手转动上盘甲。若放入的系稻子，那么如磨后其断碎少则为干燥，色泽纯一则为不杂，色黄则为已发热（俗称烧仓），有破米皮、碎米、虫粪、虫子，则为已生虫。（附图片）
