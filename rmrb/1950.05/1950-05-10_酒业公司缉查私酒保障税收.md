　　Liquor Company Cracks Down on Illicit Liquor to Guarantee Tax Revenue
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Beijing Liquor Company has transferred 100 cadres to cooperate with the Beijing Municipal Tax Bureau in inspecting tax evasion. Thirty-five cases of tax evasion have already been uncovered, involving 330 catties of baijiu (white liquor), 6,478 catties of yellow wine, 10,325 catties of firewater (strong liquor), and some qu (fermentation starter). Through this work, the company's cadres have basically reversed their idea of ​​underestimating the liquor monopoly, and corrected the erroneous view of being unwilling to investigate private liquor for fear of offending people. Currently, the pursuit of private liquor and private brewing continues.
