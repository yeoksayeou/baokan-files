Notice from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Commercial Bureau
    Business Conduct No. 5
    In the industrial and commercial re-registration conducted in 1949, the new Company Law had not yet been promulgated, so the company re-registration could not be processed simultaneously. Now, having received a reply from the Central Ministry of Trade: "Before the promulgation of the new Company Law, existing companies are allowed to register and obtain certificates first." The temporary measures for application registration are now formulated as follows:
    1. Existing companies applying for registration must fill out an application form and attach two copies each of the company's articles of association, business plan, list of shareholders, and list of directors and supervisors. If it is a branch, only two copies each of the head office's articles of association, list of shareholders, photograph of the head office's license, and letter of authorization from the head office are required. Also, please submit old photos and apply directly to this Bureau.
    2. The declared capital must be filled out based on existing assets, and a balance sheet must be attached; in addition, the original amount of shares should be converted into physical objects at the time of the company's establishment, and then converted into Renminbi according to current prices, and filled out truthfully for reference. If it is a branch and the head office does not divide the capital, the amount of the head office's capital should be indicated.
    3. The scope of business must be specific and clear.
    4. After the company's application for registration is approved, a business registration certificate will be issued. Formal registration will be processed after the new Company Law is promulgated.
    5. The registration period is from the date of the publication of this notice to the end of May.
    It is hoped that all existing companies in this city will come to the Bureau to complete the registration on time. This is hereby announced.

　　北京市人民政府商业局通告
    商行字第五号
    查一九四九年举办工商业重新登记时，新公司法尚未颁布，是以公司重新登记，未能同时办理。顷呈奉中央贸易部批复：“在新公司法颁布前，旧有各公司，准予先行登记换证。”兹将申请登记临时办法，订定如左：
    一、旧有各公司申请登记，须填具申请书一份，附呈公司章程、营业计划书、股东名册、董监事名册各二份。如系分公司，只附送总公司章程、股东名册、总公司执照照片、总公司委托书各二份。并各检同旧照，径向本局申请办理。
    二、申报资金，须根据现有资产填报，并附资产负债表；另将原有股金数额，折成公司设立时实物，再按现在物价，折合人民券，据实填写，用作参考。如系分公司，总公司不划分资金者，应将总公司资金额注明。
    三、营业范围，必须具体明确。
    四、公司申请登记，经核准后，填给商业登记证。俟新公司法颁布后，再办理正式登记。
    五、登记期间，自登报公布之日起，至五月底止。
    即希本市旧有各公司，遵期来局办理登记。特此通告。
