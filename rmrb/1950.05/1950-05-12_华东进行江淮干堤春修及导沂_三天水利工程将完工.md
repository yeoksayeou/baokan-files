　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th. East China's three major water conservancy projects—the spring repairs of the Yangtze and Huai River main dikes and the first phase of the spring Guiding the Yi River Project in Northern Jiangsu—have been mostly completed, and the unfinished dike sections are being actively rushed.

　　The spring repair project of the Yangtze River main dike is estimated at 25 million cubic meters of earthwork. According to statistics from mid-April, more than 18 million cubic meters have been completed in various regions. In northern Anhui, except for Jiangpu County, where the project of retreating and building the dike at Huangni Beach has not been completed, the projects in other regions have been basically completed. Among them, the most arduous project, the 83-kilometer-long Tongma (from Huikou to Majiagang) Dike, involved 5 million cubic meters of earthwork, and 4.58 million cubic meters were completed by early April. The Jiangdi Dike in southern Jiangsu was roughly completed by the end of April. In southern Anhui, except for Fanchang, Langxi, and Xuancheng counties, where more than half of the dike repair projects have been completed, other dike sections were basically completed by early May.

　　The spring repair project of the Huai River main dike is estimated at 6.35 million cubic meters of earthwork. About 80% had been completed by the end of April, and it is expected to be fully completed before the summer flood season in mid-May.

　　The first phase of the Guiding the Yi River Project in northern Jiangsu, except for the Guantian River (east of Shuyang) section, which is still being rushed, other projects will be completed around May 10th. In the areas where construction has been completed, in addition to continuing necessary reinforcement and tidying up, evaluation work before completion is being actively carried out to improve the quality of the project and ensure the safety of the dike body.

　　Due to thorough preparations beforehand, and with leaders at all levels going deep into the dike sections for inspection during the process, the progress and quality of the spring repair project of the Jianghuai main dike were better than the winter repair last year. On average, the speed of the spring repair of the entire Jianghuai main dike exceeded that of the winter repair by more than one time. In southern Anhui's spring repair, commissioners and county heads of the various special districts along the Yangtze River personally led the work on the dikes and implemented a system of free combination and grain distribution according to the amount of work completed, which greatly improved the morale of the workers and increased the speed of the project by more than three times compared to the winter repair. During the winter repair in northern Anhui, pounding the earth was rarely done. Before the spring repair, the dike workers all underwent technical training. Therefore, in the spring repair, more attention was paid to mastering the engineering standards, and pounding the earth was generally carried out in each dike section.

　　Under the slogan "Dig more earth, earn more grain," 340,000 people in northern Jiangsu participating in the Guiding the Yi River Project universally launched a campaign to establish merit, and work efficiency was unprecedentedly improved. Liu Chenggui's squad of the Shucheng Brigade, with a total of 15 people, completed 2,350 cubic meters of earthwork in 15 days, with each person averaging more than 6 cubic meters of earthwork per day. The Donglei Team of the Nancheng Brigade of Guanyun County completed the assigned task of more than 10,000 cubic meters in 27 days, and the dike body was clean, tidy, and up to standard, thanks to daily comparisons and competitions within the team.

　　During the spring repair in various regions, close attention was paid to combining disaster relief with spring plowing and production, and various ideological concerns of the workers were resolved in a timely manner, so that the project could progress smoothly. In the Anqing Special District of northern Anhui, around the Qingming Festival when spring plowing began, based on the specific conditions of each county, a method of self-reporting and mutual evaluation was adopted to draw some workers back home for spring plowing. The workers remaining on the dike and the workers returning home signed contracts with each other, exchanging work for work, and both parties ensured that "rice seedlings were not neglected, and dike repair was not delayed." The Jiangpu County People's Government distributed a large number of seed loans and launched social mutual assistance, which solved the difficulty of seeds for the families of the dike workers, quickly stabilized the morale of the dike workers, and significantly improved work efficiency. In the areas with particularly abundant spring fields in northern Jiangsu, the practice of assigning labor according to the area of cultivated land or the number of people was implemented, with disaster victims and families without cattle replacing non-disaster victims and families with cattle in dike construction. Spring plowing and dike repair were exchanged for labor, and accounts were settled and grain was allocated on schedule after construction began, providing disaster relief to the families of the victims. More than 45,000 workers in Shuyang County sent a total of more than 2.72 million catties of grain back home in 20 days, averaging 60 catties per person, which could sustain the living of an average household for two months. The Shuanghe construction team in the county, with 174 people working for 37 days, earned a net income of more than 31,000 catties of grain, which was transferred to various households to solve the seed problem for a total of 1,800 mu of land.

　　华东进行江淮干堤春修及导沂
　　三天水利工程将完工
    【新华社上海十一日电】华东区的三大水利工程——长江、淮河干堤春修工程及苏北春季导沂第一期工程——已大部竣工，未完成的堤段正积极赶修中。
    长江干堤春修工程预计二千五百万公方，据四月中旬统计，各地已完成一千八百余万公方。皖北除江浦县因黄泥滩退建工程未完成外，其它各地工程均已基本完成。其中最艰巨的长达八十三公里的同马（自汇口至马家港）大堤工程共五百万公方，四月初即完成了四百五十八万公方。苏南江堤至四月底已大致完成。皖南除繁昌、郎溪、宣城三县修堤工程完成半数以上外，其他堤段于五月初已基本完工。
    淮河干堤春修工程预计土方六百三十五万公方，至四月底已完成百分之八十左右，五月中旬夏汛前可全部竣工。
    苏北导沂第一期工程，除官田河（沭阳以东）一段尚在赶修外，其他工程在五月十日左右即告完工。目前已完工的地区，除继续进行必要的培修整理外，正积极进行收工前的检评工作，以便提高工程质量，确保堤身的安全。
    江淮干堤的春修工程，由于事先进行了充分的准备工作，工程进行中各级领导干部又深入堤段检查，工程的进度和质量都较去年冬修为好。平均整个江淮干堤春修速度超过冬修一倍以上。皖南春修中，沿江各专区专员、县长均亲自上堤领导，并实行了自由组合、按方发粮的制度，使民工修堤情绪大为提高，工程速度超过冬修三倍以上。皖北各堤圩在冬修期间很少打硪。在春修前，堤工干部均进行了技术学习。因此，在春修中对工程标准的掌握比较重视，各堤段普遍进行了打硪。
    苏北三十四万导沂民工在“多挖土，多挣粮”的口号下，普遍展开了立功竞赛，工作效率空前提高。沭城大队刘成桂小队共十五人，十五天内完成了二千三百五十方土，每人每天平均挖土六方多。灌云南城大队东磊中队，全队在逐日评比竞赛下，于二十七天内即完成了所分配的一万余公方的任务，而且做到堤身清净整齐，合乎标准。
    各地春修中，均密切结合了救灾与春耕生产，及时解决民工各种思想顾虑，使工程得以顺利进展。皖北安庆专区在清明前后春耕开始时，根据各县具体情况，采取自报互评的办法，抽出部分民工回家春耕；留堤民工与回家民工互订合同，以工抵工，双方保证做到“不荒秧田、不误修堤”。江浦县人民政府发放大批贷种，并发动社会互济，解决了修堤民工家中种籽的困难，使修堤民工情绪迅速稳定，工作效率显著提高。苏北春田特多地区，实行按田亩或人口出工，由灾民、无牛户代替非灾民、有牛户上河工、实行春耕与修堤换工，开工后并按期结账拨粮，给灾民的家属渡荒。沭阳四万五千余民工，二十天中共寄回家中粮食达二百七十二万余斤，平均每人得粮六十斤，一般户可维持两个月的生活。该县双河民工中队一百七十四人做工三十七天，净赚工粮三万一千余斤，先后转拨至各人家里，共解决了一千八百亩地种籽的困难。
