　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 29th. North China's state-owned grain, cotton yarn, coal, and salt trading companies have achieved significant results in the past two months by actively improving their business methods.

　　In the past, the operating methods of the aforementioned companies had many shortcomings. The first was insufficient initiative, with most waiting "at home for customers to come." Bureaucratic work styles were serious, and some cadres even believed that state-owned companies were "rich and powerful, it doesn't matter whether we sell or not," and "anyway, things are cheap, so we don't have to worry about selling them, even if the procedures are troublesome." The survey and research work of the companies was also very poor. Some areas needed white cloth, but the state-owned companies transported blue cloth instead. All of these greatly hindered sales work.

　　Since March, all companies have actively improved their business methods. The first is to actively expand the sales surface. For example, since March, Tianjin Coal and Salt Companies have sent cadres to actively contact all parties for transactions, formulate preferential measures for factories and institutions, and establish direct supply contracts with major users. In March, the amount of coal directly supplied by the Tianjin Coal Branch to factories and consumers accounted for more than 88 percent of the total coal sales. At the same time, the company also joined with private merchants to form sales offices to actively expand the supply surface. The Salt Company also promoted sales through retail company outlets. In rural areas, in addition to relying on cooperatives to promote sales, the Grain and Cotton Yarn companies also used the method of attending market days and temple fairs to sell large quantities of grain and cloth. The second is to simplify procedures and overcome bureaucratic work styles. For example, in the past, purchasing grain from the Grain Company required going through several procedures, and the goods could only be picked up the next day. Since March, the company has changed the sale of grain in the Tianjin market to collecting payment on the spot and picking up the goods immediately, which is extremely convenient for grain merchants. The third is to strengthen investigation and research to overcome blindness in operation. Some state-owned companies have begun to investigate the main problems in operation (such as market, consumption, etc.). For example, the Salt and Coal Companies carried out direct sales business based on the commodity demand situation obtained from the investigation. In addition, the close cooperation between the state-owned companies and relevant departments such as the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, banks, and cooperatives has also greatly increased the convenience of operation.

### 华北粮食、花纱布、煤业、盐业贸易公司  改进经营方法扩大商品推销

    改进经营方法扩大商品推销
    【新华社天津二十九日电】华北区国营粮食、花纱布、煤业、盐业等贸易公司，两月来积极改进经营方式，已获得显著成效。
    过去，上述各公司的经营方式，存在着很多缺点。首先是主动性不够，多是“坐在家里等客来”，机关化作风很严重，有些干部甚至认为国营公司“财大气粗，卖不卖没关系”，“反正东西贱，不愁卖不出去，手续麻烦些也不要紧”。各公司的调查研究工作也很差。有些地区人民需要白布，但国营公司运去的却是青布。这些都大大妨碍了推销工作。
    自三月份以来，各公司均积极改善了经营方法。首先是主动扩大推销面。如天津煤业、盐业两公司，自三月份起，即派出干部主动地向各方接洽交易，订出对工厂、机关的优待办法，并与各主要用户建立直接供应合同。三月份天津煤业分公司直接供给工厂和消费者的煤斤，即占全部销煤量的百分之八十八以上。同时，该公司并与私商联合组成推销处，积极扩大供应面。盐业公司也通过零售公司的代售店，普遍推销。在农村中，各公司除依靠合作社推销外，粮食、花纱布两公司并曾利用赶集和赶庙会的办法，推销了大量的粮食和布匹。其次是简化手续，克服机关化的作风。如过去从粮食公司购粮要经过好几重手续，第二天才能取货。自三月份起，该公司在天津市场售粮改为当场收款即时提货，买粮食的客商极感便利。再次是加强调查研究，克服经营中的盲目性。有些国营公司已开始调查经营中的主要问题（如市场、消费量等）。如盐业、煤业等公司在开展直接推销业务中，即是根据调查所得的商品需求情况进行的。此外各国营公司在业务经营中和工商局、银行、合作社等有关部门的密切配合，也大大增加了经营的便利。
