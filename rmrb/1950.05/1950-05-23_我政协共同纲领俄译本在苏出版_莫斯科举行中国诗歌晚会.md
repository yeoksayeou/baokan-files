　　Russian Translation of the CPPCC Common Program Published in the Soviet Union
    Chinese Poetry Evening Held in Moscow
    [Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd Dispatch] Moscow Air Dispatch: The Russian translation of the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was published by the Soviet State Political Literature Publishing House in April. The latest issue (Issue 8) of the "Bolshevik" magazine, the organ of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party, featured an article introducing it, emphasizing that this Common Program is the construction program of New China. The article stated: "The establishment of the People's Republic of China marks the end of the Chinese national liberation struggle. The tasks now facing the Chinese people, in terms of their scale, significance, magnitude and complexity, are no less than overthrowing the Kuomintang reactionary regime. The most important of these are: protecting the independence already gained from imperialist encroachment, finally liberating Chinese territory from the remnants of the defeated Kuomintang army, and completing the elimination of the landlord feudal system. Moreover, a great deal of labor, effort, and creativity are needed to restore the national economy, increase the production of industrial and agricultural products, thereby establishing the foundation for China's industrialization, and eliminating the painful consequences of the Kuomintang reactionary rule." The article believes that the Common Program can guide the Chinese people in solving these tasks, and stated: "Every article of the Common Program is a summary of the heroic people's long-term struggle, and a call to labor and struggle for the prosperity of the liberated democratic China. Millions of Soviet citizens will study the Common Program with great interest, because they all warmly care about the struggle of the Chinese people."
    [Xinhua News Agency, 21st Dispatch] TASS, Moscow Dispatch: The Central Writers' Club in Moscow held a literary evening on the 19th to celebrate the translation of Chinese poetry. The famous Soviet Sinologist, Airdling, gave a report at the meeting on classical Chinese poetry and New China poetry. Airdling pointed out: Soviet readers have a great interest in the works of Chinese poets. Recently, several classical and modern Chinese poems have been published here in Russian. Particularly popular are the poets of New China who have dedicated their works to the Chinese people's struggle for freedom and independence. At the evening, the poem "The Spring of Justice" by modern Chinese poet Tian Jian, which celebrates the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, and several poems about the Chinese people's struggle against the Kuomintang were recited in newly translated Russian.

　　我政协共同纲领俄译本在苏出版
    莫斯科举行中国诗歌晚会
    【新华社二十二日讯】莫斯科航讯：中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领的俄译本，已于四月间由苏联国家政治书籍出版局出版。联共中央机关刊物《布尔什维克》杂志最近一期（第八期）特著专文介绍，着重指出这一共同纲领是新中国的建设纲领。该文称：“中华人民共和国的建立，标志着中国民族解放斗争已告一段落。现在，中国人民所面临的任务，按其规模和意义之重大和复杂来说，并不下于推翻国民党反动派政权。其中最主要的是：保护已取得的独立免受帝国主义的侵害，从溃败的国民党军队残余手里最后地解放中国领土，和完成消灭地主封建制度。并且，需要许许多多的劳动、努力和创造性，来恢复全国的国民经济，增加工业品和农业品的出产，从而建立中国工业化的基础，和消灭国民党反动派统治的痛苦后果。”该文认为共同纲领是能够指导中国人民解决这些任务的，并称：“共同纲领的每一款，都是英勇人民的长期斗争的总结，都是要求为解放了的民主中国的繁荣而劳动和斗争的号召。千百万苏联公民将以极大的兴趣来研究共同纲领，因为他们都热情地关心中国人民的斗争。”
