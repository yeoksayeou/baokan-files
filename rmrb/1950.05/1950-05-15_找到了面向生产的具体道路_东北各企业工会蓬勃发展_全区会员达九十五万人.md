Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 13th. Northeast trade union work has experienced vigorous development in the past year or so, due to finding a concrete path for how to orient itself towards production.

At present, the total number of trade union members in all public and private enterprises in Northeast China exceeds 950,000, nearly doubling since May of last year. Among them, industrial union members account for more than 80% of the total number of industrial workers; railway union members account for 93% of the total number of railway workers. Over 118,000 employees in private enterprises have joined trade unions, also more than double the number from May of last year.

The rapid recovery and development of economic construction in Northeast China over the past year has benefited greatly from the active cooperation of trade union organizations. After the liberation of the entire Northeast, trade union organizations at all levels in Northeast China mobilized and organized the broad masses of workers to participate in protecting factories and mines and assisting in their takeover, especially launching a movement to contribute materials, which greatly facilitated the rapid resumption of work in various enterprises and factories. Around May Day last year, workers in various enterprises in Northeast China, under the call of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, universally launched a production emulation campaign. More than 400,000 employees participated, and tens of thousands of production models emerged. Following this movement, enterprises launched anti-waste and new record creation campaigns. Through these movements, in addition to improving labor productivity, improving the organization of production, and the emergence of a large number of advanced producers, trade union work gained concrete and vivid content for implementing the policy of developing production.

	Promoting the Contract System Extensively During the New Record Movement

From the development of the new record movement, the trade union also found that the main working method to promote production was to promote the contract system. According to current statistics, a total of 112 production units in the public-owned industrial and mining systems have signed collective contracts; 699 workshops have signed joint workshop contracts; and 218 have signed contracted labor contracts. The signing of various contracts is not only a good way to promote and strengthen the planning of production, but also a good working method for trade unions to mobilize all employees to further implement democratic management and the responsibility system, and to ensure the completion of national production plans. For example, Shenyang Machine Tool Plant No. 3 originally planned to produce 35 lathes in September of last year. After the trade union mobilized workers for democratic discussion, in addition to deciding to increase the target to 40, they also strived to exceed it by 5. Thanks to the signing of collective contracts and joint workshop contracts, the above decision was fully realized. Fushun Steel Plant had more than 80 tons of steelmaking tasks unfulfilled by March of this year due to arrears in the first half of the year; but because the trade union mobilized employees to sign a contract in the steelmaking branch, and because workers put forward many rationalization proposals, the original task was not only exceeded and quality improved, but also reduced the occurrence of accidents and promoted the establishment of the responsibility system. Around the implementation of the contract system, trade unions in various places have also created many other organizational forms and activity methods for leading production. Such as production wage committees, rationalization proposal committees, workshop production meetings, advanced producer meetings, as well as production charts, waste product exhibitions, and red flag emulation competitions, all of which have played a significant role in developing production.

	Trade Unions and Administrative Departments Universally Carry Out Labor Protection Work

With the development of production and construction, trade unions, in conjunction with administrative departments, have universally launched labor insurance work in various parts of Northeast China. According to incomplete statistics, a total of more than 550,000 employees in the region have implemented labor insurance; and the family members of employees who indirectly or partially benefit from labor insurance total approximately 1.55 million. In terms of the collective labor insurance facilities, there are currently 41 workers' hospitals in the region; 220 clinics; and some enterprises have set up nurseries, homes for the elderly and disabled, orphanages, and sanatoriums. At present, in addition to assisting administrative departments in vigorously expanding collective labor insurance, trade unions in various places are also assisting administrative departments in starting to improve the safety and hygiene equipment of factories and mines. The main gain from the implementation of labor insurance is that it has improved workers' class consciousness and enthusiasm for production from the actual benefits of protecting workers' health and reducing their living difficulties, especially breaking the traditional "technical conservatism" and "relying on fate" thinking of old skilled workers, and universally launching a "teaching apprentices" competition.

Northeast trade unions at all levels also began to strengthen workers' cultural and educational work in the second half of last year. According to incomplete statistics, more than 3,600 cultural evening schools have been established in the fourteen regional and industrial union systems; and more than 177,000 illiterate workers are participating in the studies.

　　找到了面向生产的具体道路
　　东北各企业工会蓬勃发展
    全区会员达九十五万人
    【新华社沈阳十三日电】东北工会工作由于找到了如何面向生产的具体道路，在过去一年多来有了蓬勃的发展。
    目前东北全区各公私营企业的工会会员共有九十五万余人，较去年五月增加了将近两倍。其中产业工会会员占产业职工总数的百分之八十以上；铁路工会会员占铁路职工总数的百分之九十三。私营企业职工参加工会者有十一万八千余人，较去年五月亦增加了一倍以上。
    一年来东北经济建设恢复与发展的迅速，工会组织的积极配合曾起了极大的作用。当东北全境解放后，东北各级工会组织曾动员组织广大工人参加了保护厂矿协助接收等工作，特别是发动了献纳器材的运动，大大便利了各企业工厂的迅速复工。去年“五一”前后，东北各企业工人在东北总工会的号召下，曾普遍展开了生产竞赛运动。参加的职工在四十万人以上，涌现的生产模范达数万人。继这一运动之后，各企业开展了反浪费和创造新纪绿运动。经过这次运动，除提高了劳动生产率，改进了生产组织形式和涌现了大批先进生产者而外，并使工会工作对于执行发展生产的方针，有了具体生动的内容。
            开展新纪录运动中广泛推行合同制度
    从新纪录运动的开展中，工会并找到了推动生产的主要工作方式为推行合同制度。据目前的统计，各公营工矿系统中已签订集体合同的生产单位共有一百一十二个；签订车间联系合同的有六百九十九个；签订包工合同的有二百一十八个。各种合同的订立，不仅是促进和加强生产的计划性的好办法，而且是工会发动全体职工进一步贯彻民主管理和责任制度，保证完成了国家生产计划的良好的工作方式。如沈阳机器三厂，去年九月原定计划为生产三十五台车床，经过工会发动工人民主讨论后，除决定提高为四十台外，并争取超过五台。由于有了集体合同和各车间联系合同的订立，结果上项决定已全部实现。抚顺制钢厂今年三月份的炼钢任务在上半年的拖欠下，有八十多吨没有完成；但由于工会发动职工在炼钢分场签订了合同，并由于工人提出了许多合理化建议，结果不但超过了原定任务和提高了质量，并且减少了事故的发生和推动了责任制的建立。围绕着合同制的推行，各地工会并创造了许多领导生产的其他的组织形式和活动方法。如生产工资委员会、合理化建议委员会、车间生产会议、先进生产者会议，以及生产图表、废物制成品展览和夺红旗竞赛等，对于发展生产都起了很大的作用。
            工会协同行政方面普遍开展劳保工作
    随着生产建设的发展，工会协同行政方面在东北各地普遍展开劳动保险工作。据不完全统计，全区已实行劳动保险的职工计有五十五万余人；间接或部分受到劳动保险利益的职工家属，共约一百五十余万人。在集体劳动保险事业的设备方面，全区现有工人医院四十一处；医务所二百二十处；若干企业并设有托儿所、养老残废院、孤儿保育院和疗养所等。目前各地工会除了协助行政方面在大力扩充集体劳动保险事业外，并正在协助行政方面着手改善工厂、矿山的安全卫生设备的工作。实行劳动保险的主要收获是从保护工人健康减轻其生活困难的实际利益中，提高了工人的阶级觉悟和生产积极性，特别是打破了老技术工人的传统的“技术保守”和“靠命运吃饭”的思想，而普遍展开了“教徒弟”的竞赛。
    东北各级工会又在去年下半年开始加强工人的文化教育工作。据目前不完全统计，在十四个地区与产业工会系统中，已设立文化夜校三千六百余所；参加学习的文盲工人达十七万七千余人。
