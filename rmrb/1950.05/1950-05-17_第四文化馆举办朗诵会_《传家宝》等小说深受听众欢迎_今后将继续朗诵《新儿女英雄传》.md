　　The Fourth Cultural Center Holds Recitation Meeting
　　Novels Such as "The Heirloom" Are Very Popular with the Audience
　　"New Heroes and Heroines" Will Continue to Be Recited in the Future
[Reported by this newspaper] In order to carry out mass cultural activities, the Fourth Cultural Center of Kyoto has held two novel recitation meetings. The first time, "The Heirloom" by Zhao Shuli was recited. The second time, "Female Communist Party Member" by Li Bozhao was recited. A total of more than 460 people attended the two times, all of whom were workers, working people, and housewives who were illiterate or had little literacy. The audience welcomed this form of literary activity. When "The Heirloom" was recited, several housewives laughed so hard that they could hardly breathe. After the recitation, the audience asked for another article to be recited; "Widow Tian Watches Melons" by Zhao Shuli was recited. A discussion was also held on the spot. During the discussion of "The Heirloom," the audience unanimously expressed their love for Jin Gui and criticized Li Chengniang for having feudal ideas. After the recitation of "Female Communist Party Member," it was impossible to hold a discussion due to the large number of listeners, but many listeners said, "This is interesting." After the meeting, the audience scrambled to ask the date of the next recitation. The museum has decided to make the recitation meeting a regular periodic activity. The reciters for the first two times were Comrade Bai Rong from the museum. In the future, it is planned to invite comrades from other departments to participate and to train some activists to recite. It is recently scheduled to recite "New Heroes and Heroines" continuously; and it is planned to go to various adult literacy schools or factories to recite.

　　In addition, the Fourth Cultural Center recently held a story meeting for out-of-school and in-school children. The stories told were "Good Brothers" by Zhang Tianyi and "The Scarecrow" by Ye Shaojun. They all liked listening to them. (Fourth Cultural Center Correspondence Group)

　　第四文化馆举办朗诵会
　　《传家宝》等小说深受听众欢迎
　　今后将继续朗诵《新儿女英雄传》
    【本报讯】京市第四文化馆为了开展群众性的文艺活动，已举办了两次小说朗诵会。第一次是朗诵的赵树理著的《传家宝》。第二次是李伯钊的《女共产党员》。两次共到听众四百六十余人，都为不识字或识字很少的工人、劳动人民及家庭妇女。听众很欢迎这一形式的文艺活动。朗诵《传家宝》时，有几个家庭妇女笑得喘不过气来。朗诵完后，听众要求再朗诵一篇；又朗诵了赵树理著的《田寡妇看瓜》。当场并进行了讨论。讨论《传家宝》时，听众对金桂一致表示热爱，批评李成娘有封建思想。朗诵了《女共产党员》后，因听众多，无法进行讨论，但好多听众说：“这有意思”。会后，听众都争问下次朗诵的日期。该馆已决定将朗诵会作为一个经常的定期活动。前两次的朗诵者均为该馆白融同志，今后打算邀请其他部门的同志参加，并培养一部分积极分子朗诵。最近预定连续朗诵《新儿女英雄传》；并打算到各成人补习学校或工厂去朗诵。
    又，此外第四文化馆日前曾召开了一次故事会，听众为失学及在学的儿童。讲的故事有张天翼著的《好兄弟》，及叶绍钧的《稻草人》。他们都很喜欢听。（四馆通讯组）
