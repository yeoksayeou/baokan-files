Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 18th: Troops of the People's Liberation Army Third Field Army stationed in the Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou areas are conducting various production and construction activities, utilizing the time spared from suppressing bandits, training, and guarding cities. In terms of agricultural production, they have now basically completed the spring production tasks.

In terms of agricultural production, according to incomplete statistics, the total amount of land cultivated by various units in the Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou urban areas has reached over 20,000 mu. The Songhu Garrison troops have reclaimed nearly 8,000 mu of wasteland, expanding the cultivated land area sixfold compared to before the start of spring plowing. A certain unit stationed in Nanjing has completed sowing on over 700 mu of the 1,700+ mu of wasteland they have reclaimed. A certain corps reclaimed 4,500 mu of wasteland during breaks from intense training, and has already harvested over 900,000 jin of green vegetables.

In order to continue improving agricultural production, all units attach importance to strengthening the guidance of production techniques. They practice intensive cultivation and fine farming, select superior varieties, and process and apply fertilizer to increase yields. A certain unit stationed in Nanjing sent personnel to the Agricultural Experiment Station to learn production knowledge. The Songhu Garrison units have mostly organized personnel with rich production experience into production technology guidance groups or research groups, inviting agricultural experts to the troops to give special reports and hold production seminars, organizing visiting groups to exchange production experience, and frequently learning production knowledge from local farmers.

With the expansion of agricultural production, all units are also constantly improving their organizational leadership. The Songhu Garrison troops have adopted the principles of decentralized management, division of labor with individual responsibility, unified leadership, and unified planning. Production in government offices generally implements a system of labor exchange: "Three people's work is done by two, and one is drawn out for production." When some troops move due to combat missions, the land left behind is cultivated and planted on behalf of them by fraternal troops organized by the production committee, so it is not left barren.

Sideline production also greatly developed in the spring. The Songhu Garrison troops and a certain corps alone raised more than 5,950 pigs and sheep. A certain unit raised 400 million yuan to jointly fish with fishermen, and harvested more than 20,000 jin of seafood in the spring. Various units of a certain corps dug nearly 2 million jin of wild vegetables and collected 1.6 million jin of firewood in the spring.

All units also vigorously participated in national construction and water conservancy projects. The Songhu Garrison troops have participated in over 94,800 workdays from late February to late April. The troops stationed in Taicang completed two Jiangdi and river embankment projects, each over 700 meters long, and two river channels, irrigating the farmland of local troops and farmers. The Nanjing Garrison troops participated in the construction of the Xiaguan Railway Station subgrade with more than 50,000 workdays, completing 5,022 cubic meters of earthwork, and also completed 125,800 cubic meters of Jiangdi earthwork. A certain unit in eastern Zhejiang dispatched more than 1,600 people to open rivers and build dikes in their area, saving more than 3,000 mu of fertile land from the disaster of waterlogging. A certain unit stationed in eastern Zhejiang dug a canal more than 400 meters long in Hongtang Township, Cixi County, saving more than 20,000 mu of land in the township from the disasters of drought, flood, and seawater intrusion. The residents of the township specially named the river the "Army-Civilian River" to show their gratitude.

In order to ensure the correct implementation of production policies and encourage the troops' lasting enthusiasm for labor, all units attached importance to strengthening the leadership of political work in production. The Songhu Garrison troops formulated regulations on earning merit through production, and a large number of labor production models emerged in various units. The civil affairs departments of political organs at all levels have been changed to civil affairs production departments, responsible for guiding production and conducting policy and discipline inspections. In spring production, it was generally possible to pay attention to mastering production policies. The Songhu Garrison troops signed contracts for all borrowed land. In order to take care of urban sanitation, all units transported manure at night.

　　三野驻扎宁沪杭地区部队
    利用空隙时间完成春季生产
    大力参加国家建设完成“军民河”等水利工程
    【新华社南京十八日电】人民解放军第三野战军驻南京、上海、杭州地区的部队，利用剿匪、练兵、警备城市的空隙时间进行各种生产建设工作，在农业生产方面现在已经基本上完成了春季生产的任务。
    农业生产方面，据不完全统计：宁、沪、杭市区各部垦种的土地总数已达二万亩以上。淞沪警备部队垦荒近八千亩，较春耕开始前的耕地面积扩大了六倍。驻南京某部在开垦的一千七百余亩荒地上，已有七百余亩播种完毕。某兵团在紧张练兵空隙中开荒四千五百亩，已收获青菜九十余万斤。
    各部为了继续提高农业生产，都重视加强生产技术的指导。实行精耕细作，选择优良品种，加工施肥，以提高产量。驻宁某部派人到农业试验所学习生产常识；淞沪警备部队各连队大都将具有丰富生产经验的人员组织起来，成为生产技术指导组或研究组，邀请农业专家们到部队来作专门报告和举行生产座谈会，组织参观团交流生产经验，并经常向当地农民学习生产知识。
    随着农业生产的扩大，各部在组织领导上也不断改进。淞沪警备部队采取了分散经营，分工负责，统一领导，统一计划的方针。机关生产普遍实行变工，“三人工作两人干，抽出一人去生产”。有些部队因有战斗任务移防时，遗下的土地则由生产委员会组织兄弟部队代耕、代种，不使荒废。
    副业生产在春季也有很大发展。仅淞沪警备部队及某兵团即养猪、羊五千九百五十余头。某部集资四亿元与渔民合伙捕鱼，春季收获海产二万余斤。某兵团各部春季挖野菜近二百万斤，拾柴草一百六十万斤。
    各部并以大力参加了国家建设及水利工程。淞沪警备部队自二月下旬至四月下旬已参加了九万四千八百余工。太仓驻军完成了长七百余公尺的江堤、河堤工程二处和河渠二道，使当地部队、农民的耕地得到灌溉。南京警备部队以五万多工参加修筑下关车站路基，完成了五千零二十二土方，并完成了十二万五千八百土方的江堤工程。浙东某部出动一千六百余人在驻地开河筑堤，使三千余亩良田免除积水浸淹的灾害。驻浙东某部在慈溪县洪塘乡挖了一条长四百余公尺的河渠，使该乡二万多亩土地免除了水旱及海水倒灌的灾害。该乡居民特命名该河为“军民河”以示感谢。
    为保证正确执行生产政策和鼓舞部队持久的劳动热情，各部在生产中均重视加强政治工作的领导。淞沪警备部队制订了生产立功条例，各单位涌现出大批的劳动生产模范。各级政治机关的民运部门均改为民运生产部门，负责指导生产，进行政策纪律检查。在春季生产中，一般对生产政策均能注意掌握。淞沪警备部队凡借用土地均订有合同。为照顾城市卫生，各部运粪均在深夜进行。
