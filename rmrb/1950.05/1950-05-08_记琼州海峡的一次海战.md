　　A Naval Battle in the Qiongzhou Strait

　　After the powerful People's Liberation Army gunboat squadron repelled enemy ships' interception and completed the task of covering the main force's crossing of the sea to land on Hainan Island on the evening of April 16th, it returned to the north shore in full on the 17th. On the way back, suddenly, two enemy ships were spotted to the right front of the second squadron. Four gunboats unhesitatingly went full speed ahead to meet them. However, one of the gunboats, No. 5, had a motor malfunction and fell behind.
　　Gunboat No. 5 was proceeding slowly when it suddenly spotted an enemy ship approaching from the southwest. The artillery commander decided to adopt close-range firing to deal a heavy blow to the enemy ship.
　　When about 500 meters away from the enemy ship, Gunboat No. 5 simultaneously activated all prepared light and heavy weapons, spraying countless beams of fire at the enemy ship. The enemy ship returned fire in a panic. On the vast sea, one ship and one gunboat engaged in a fierce battle.
　　Artillery Director Huang Yu stood beside the gun position, constantly indicating the firing target. A bullet flew over and pierced his right arm, and blood soaked his clothes. At the stern, the captain, Tie Jun, who was steering the rudder, was also wounded in the left arm by a shell. However, both of them persisted in commanding the battle. Helmsman Shen Qinde and Che Chunlu, braving dense enemy fire, used all their strength to hold the rudder, maintaining the orientation of the hull so that the muzzle always faced the enemy ship. When the two drivers fell beside the machine due to extreme fatigue and the violent shaking of the hull, Liu Zhiheng alone managed all the machinery, not even bothering to wipe the sweat from his face. The artillerymen showed the same calm and courage as in land battles. Amidst the swaying waves, Second Gunner Zhao Zhanzhu was able to accurately fire shells, hitting the enemy ship repeatedly. Light machine gunner Fan Mingxun also aimed at the enemy ship and fired more than 300 rounds in succession. When the anti-aircraft gunner could not hear the command due to being deafened by the vibrations, the guard automatically took over the firing. Various weapons on the gunboat formed a strong fire net, sweeping towards the enemy ship.
　　During the fierce battle, the shell of the anti-tank gun on the gunboat suddenly could not be ejected. The enemy's machine gun, which had been suppressed, took the opportunity to clamor again. A shell exploded on the deck of the gunboat, and Zhao Zhanzhu suffered serious injuries to his head and chest, but he was still unwilling to leave his gun position. Until just before his sacrifice, he grabbed the platoon leader's hand and shouted, "Has the shell casing been ejected? Shoot quickly!" Such tenacious fighting will encouraged all the commanders to calmly organize fire to return the attack. Just when things were critical, brother gunboats came to help, firing on the enemy ship from 2,000 meters away. A thick plume of smoke and fire rose from the deck of the enemy ship. The enemy ship finally stopped moving completely and was later towed away by another enemy ship that rushed to rescue it in a panic.
　　At 13:00 on the morning of the 17th, the gunboat unit all victoriously returned to the north shore.

　　记琼州海峡的一次海战
    其瑞
    强大的人民解放军炮艇队击退敌舰阻击，于四月十六日晚完成掩护主力部队渡海登陆海南岛的任务后，于十七日全部折北岸。在回航途中，忽然在二队右前方发现了两艘敌舰。四只炮艇毫不犹豫地开足了马力迎头赶上去。但其中第五号炮舰有一部马达发生了故障，掉在后面。
    五号艇正缓慢地行进着，忽又发现从西南方有一艘敌舰驶来。炮兵指挥员决心采取近距离射击，以便痛击敌舰。
    在与敌舰相距约五百米的时候，五号炮艇将准备好的全部轻重火器一齐开动，向敌舰喷射出无数道火光。敌舰仓皇还击。辽阔的海面上，一舰一艇展开了激战。
    炮兵主任黄宇站在炮位旁不断指示着射击目标。一颗子弹飞来，打穿了他的右臂，鲜血浸透衣服。在舵尾掌握船舵的艇长铁军，左臂上也为炮弹击伤。但他们两人仍然坚持指挥战斗。舵手申勤德与车春罗冒着密集的敌火，使出全身力量抱住舵杆，保持艇身的方位，使炮口始终朝向敌舰。当两个司机因极度疲劳和船身的激烈震动而摔倒机器旁时，刘志恒便单独一个人管着全部机器，汗流满面也顾不得擦。炮兵们则表现了和陆地作战一样的沉着勇敢。在海浪颠簸中，二炮手赵赞珠还能准确地发射炮弹，按连命中敌舰。轻机枪手范明训也对准敌舰接连打了三百余发。机关炮手因耳朵被振聋而听不见指挥时，警卫员就自动接替发射。炮艇上的各种火器组成一片强烈的火网，向敌舰扫过去。
    激战中，炮艇上的战防炮的弹壳突然退不出来了。曾被压制的敌人的机关炮乘机又叫嚣起来。一颗炮弹在炮艇的舱面上爆炸，赵赞珠的头部胸部都负了重伤，但他还不愿离开炮位。直到临牺牲前，他还抓住排长的手叫着：“弹谷退出来没有？快打！”这样顽强的战斗意志，鼓舞着全体指挥员沉着地组织火力还击。正紧急的时候，兄弟炮艇赶来助战，从两千米外发炮击中敌舰。一股浓烈的烟火自敌舰甲板上冒起来。敌舰最后完全停止了蠕动，后来才被慌忙前来抢救的另一艘敌舰拖炮了。
    十七日上午十三时，炮艇部队全部胜利地返回北岸。
