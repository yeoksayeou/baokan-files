【Beijing News Agency Dispatch】According to statistics from the Municipal Taxation Bureau, the total industrial and commercial tax revenue for the second half of 1949 in Beijing, as of the final statutory payment deadline of April 30th, amounted to 29.75878 billion yuan in Renminbi (in addition to over 150,000 jin of rice collected in rice certificates), accounting for 83.4% of the tax amount stated on the issued payment notices (payment notices for the trade and hospital/clinic sectors have not yet been issued due to the adoption of a declaration-based tax assessment method). The collection of industrial and commercial tax in Beijing this time was carried out under the circumstances of temporary difficulties faced by industry and commerce. The general industrial and commercial operators in Beijing have made great efforts to complete the glorious task of paying taxes. In addition to individual cases of intentional delay in payment, which should be punished according to regulations, the Municipal Taxation Bureau has decided to provide appropriate consideration to certain industries and individual industrial and commercial operators who are indeed experiencing temporary financial difficulties, so as to help them overcome the current period of temporary difficulties in industry and commerce. Instructions have been issued to the various taxation sub-bureaus to pay close attention to this matter.

　　去年下半年工商税入库二百九十七亿
    【京市新闻处讯】京市一九四九年下半年工商业税纳库情形，据市税务局统计，截至四月三十日法定缴款期限最后一日止，两期纳库数字共计人民券二百九十七亿五千八百七十八万余元（另收折米券折米十五万余斤），占发出缴款通知书所开税款的百分之八十三点四（尚有贸易、医院诊所两业缴款通知书因采用申报核税办法还未发出）。此次京市工商业税的征收是在工商业面临暂时困难的情况下进行的，京市一般工商业者都已尽了很大努力来完成纳税的光荣任务。除个别有意拖延不交的应照章处罚外，对某些行业与个别工商业者暂时在筹款上确有困难的，市税务局决定予以适当照顾，使他们得以渡过目前工商业暂时困难的时期，现已分令各税务分局切实注意。
