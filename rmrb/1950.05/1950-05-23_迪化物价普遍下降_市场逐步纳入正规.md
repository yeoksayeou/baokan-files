Xinhua News Agency, Dihua, 18th: With the improvement of the national economy, prices in Dihua City have generally fallen. Comparing early April with early May, cloth, tea, and other items have fallen by about 50%, while grain prices have remained stable. Due to stable prices and abundant market supplies, a large quantity of goods have been transported in. In one month, more than 14,000 bolts of cloth and nearly 30,000 bricks of tea were transported from other places. The phenomenon of supply and demand imbalance in the market in the past no longer exists. With the vigorous flow of goods, bank remittances are constantly increasing. The Dihua Xinjiang Provincial Bank remitted more than 4 billion yuan in RMB in the first week of May. At the same time, the principal-protected and value-protected savings deposits offered by the National Bank have absorbed a portion of social idle funds. Due to the stability of finance and prices, the phenomenon of speculation and profiteering has been basically eliminated, and the Dihua market has gradually returned to normal.

　　迪化物价普遍下降
    市场逐步纳入正规
    【新华社迪化十八日电】在全国经济好转情况下，迪化市物价普遍下跌。以四月上旬与本月上旬比较，布、茶等下跌百分之五十左右，粮价则呈稳定状态。由于物价稳定，市场物资充沛，商品大量运进，计一个月内即由外地运进布匹一万四千余匹，砖茶近三万块，过去市场供求失调的现象已不再存在。随着物资交流的畅旺，银行汇款不断增加。迪化新疆省银行在五月上旬一周中即汇出人民币四十余亿元。同时，国家银行举办的保本保值储蓄存款，吸收了一部分社会游资。由于金融物价稳定，投机倒把的现象已基本消灭，迪化市场已逐步纳入正轨。
