　　Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. The international reactionaries, headed by U.S. imperialism, who have not yet learned their lesson from their disastrous defeat on the Chinese mainland, are organizing a so-called "International Air Force" to prepare for new adventures in China. A dispatch from a United Press reporter from St. Louis, USA, on April 30, fully exposed this sinister plan. According to the reporter, "Officials of the embryonic International Air Force and personnel of Chennault's Civil Air Transport met in St. Louis on the night of April 29 to formulate plans for actively assisting the Chinese Nationalists." This new plan of aggression against China is clearly supported by the U.S. government. According to the reporter, the commander of the so-called "International Air Force," former U.S. Air Force Captain Castor, said: "If the State Department continues to adopt a 'hands-off' policy towards the air force, it will be ready to take action by July." At the same time, the composition of the team is also related to the United States and other imperialist countries. According to the aforementioned aggressor Castor, the air force has American-made P-51 fighters, B-25 bombers, and British-made Lancaster bombers; the team's administrative officers are former U.S. Marine Corps personnel, and the other personnel are a group of desperadoes from the United States, Britain, and Canada, most of whom are wartime American Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps pilots. According to Castor's confession, "the International Air Force will be financially supported by the Chinese Nationalists." He said that the team's personnel receive the same treatment as the U.S. Air Force, "but with an additional 30 percent hazard pay."

　　美帝新罪恶侵华阴谋筹组“国际航空队”援匪
    【新华社二日讯】还没有从中国大陆上的惨败中获得教训的以美帝国主义为首的国际反动派，正组织所谓“国际航空队”准备在中国作新冒险。合众社记者四月三十日自美国圣路易城发出的电讯完全暴露了这项罪恶计划。据该记者说，“在胚胎中的国际航空队的官员们和陈纳德航空公司的人员们，曾于四月二十九日夜在圣路易集会，以制定积极援助中国国民党的计划。”这一对中国的新的侵略计划，显然受到美国政府支持。据该记者报道，所谓“国际航空队”的指挥官前美国空军上尉卡斯托说：“如果国务院继续对航空队采取‘放手’政策，则到七月该队就要行动起来。”同时，该队的组成还与美国及其他帝国主义国家有关。据前述侵略分子卡斯托说，该航空队有美国制的Ｐ五一式战斗机、Ｂ二五式轰炸机和英国制的兰开斯特式轰炸机；该队行政官员是前美国海军陆战队的人员，其他人员是美国、英国、加拿大的一批亡命之徒，其中多数是战时的美国空军的、海军的和海军陆战队的飞行员。据卡斯托供认，“国际航空队将受到中国国民党的财政支持。”他说，该队人员的待遇都与美国空军相同，“但另加百分之三十的冒险费”。
