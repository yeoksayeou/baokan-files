Xinhua News Agency, 13th Dispatch: Supporting the statement of the Central People's Government of China, the representatives of the Soviet Union and Poland protested against the continued retention of representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary remnant clique at the International Committee meeting of the International Red Cross Association, which opened in Geneva on the 10th, and have respectively declared their refusal to attend the meeting.

According to a TASS report from Bern: The Soviet representative, Kolyukin, on behalf of the Soviet Red Cross Society, declared at the opening of the meeting that he supported the statement of the Government of the People’s Republic of China and proposed that the Kuomintang representative be expelled from the International Committee. Kolyukin declared: "If the Kuomintang representative is not expelled from the International Committee, the Soviet Red Cross Society will not participate in the International Committee meetings and will not recognize the resolutions passed by the meeting as legal."

The chairman of the meeting, O'Connor, disregarding the meeting procedures, attempted to prevent the Soviet representative from making the above statement. Afterwards, he did not submit the statement for discussion or solicit the opinions of other representatives on the issue. The Soviet delegation then withdrew from the meeting.

According to a Polish Press Agency report: Because the International Committee of the International Red Cross Association did not invite representatives from the Red Cross Society of the People's Republic of China to participate, the Polish government and the Polish Red Cross Society have respectively protested to the Secretary of the International Red Cross Association and declared that they will not participate in the meeting until the International Committee formally recognizes the Red Cross Society of the People's Republic of China as a member of the International Committee.

　　苏波代表拒绝出席   
    抗议保留国民党残匪代表
    【新华社十三日讯】苏联和波兰两国代表支持我国中央人民政府的声明，抗议十日在日内瓦开幕的国际红十字协会国际委员会会议中继续保留国民党反动残余集团的代表，已分别声明拒绝出席这次会议。
    据塔斯社伯尔尼讯：苏联代表科尔尤金，在会议开幕时，代表苏联红十字会声明，拥护中华人民共和国政府的声明，并提议把国民党代表开除出国际委员会。科尔尤金宣称：“如果不把国民党代表开除出国际委员会，则苏联红十字会就将不参加国际委员会会议，亦不承认该会议所通过的决议为合法”。
    会议主席奥康纳不顾会议程序，竟图阻止苏联代表作上述声明，其后，又不把该声明付诸讨论或征求其他代表对这一问题的意见。苏联代表团遂退出会场。
    另据波兰通讯社消息：由于国际红十字协会国际委员会未邀请中华人民共和国红十字会代表参加，波兰政府与波兰红十字会已分别向国际红十字协会秘书提出抗议，并声明在国际红十字协会正式承认中华人民共和国红十字会为国际委员会委员以前，将不参加此次会议。
