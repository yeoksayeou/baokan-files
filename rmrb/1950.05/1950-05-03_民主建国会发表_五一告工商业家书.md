Xinhua News Agency, May 1st: The Democratic National Construction Association has recently issued a letter entitled "Respectfully Addressed to Industrial and Commercial Figures Across the Nation on the Occasion of the May Day Labor Festival," the full text of which is as follows:

　　Today marks the first great May Day Labor Festival since the founding of the People's Republic of China. Although the new nation still faces many unavoidable difficulties, and the national industry and commerce are similarly experiencing these difficulties, it is clear that we are now the people of an independent, free, democratic, and unified nation. This is the position we have longed for day and night for many years, and now we have finally achieved it. We should rejoice and be encouraged by this hard-won position—looking ahead from this position, the future is limitless. We should further build full confidence for the bright future!

　　Who gave us today's position? We must sincerely thank the leading class—the working class, and the leading party—the Chinese Communist Party, for their incomparably correct leadership of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution; we must sincerely thank the People's Liberation Army for their incomparably heroic efforts in winning the victory of the revolutionary war and the basic liberation of the whole country with their flesh and blood! In this great revolution, the strength contributed by our national industrialists and business people was very weak and should be expressed with remorse.

　　Chairman Mao put forward the slogan of "taking into consideration both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital," giving our national industrialists and business people the glorious task and bright prospect of dedicating themselves to the motherland and working together to build a new country. The slogans issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to celebrate May Day Labor Day once again proposed "resolutely implement the policy of taking into consideration both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital, and welcome the national bourgeoisie to invest in developing production undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood" and "the working class of the whole country unite as one, unite with the national bourgeoisie, work together to overcome temporary difficulties, and strive for a gradual improvement in the economic situation." This will make our national industrialists and business people more grateful and more excited. Our national industrialists and business people must seize the opportunity, sincerely accept the glorious tasks given to us by the leading class and the leading party, contribute all our strength, and strive to build the new national economy under the leadership of the state-owned economy! In the future, the People's Government will certainly give more specific assistance and guarantees to production undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

　　On this great festival, our national industrialists and business people must study well the truth that labor creates the world, completely eliminate the remnants of the backward consciousness that looks down on labor and workers and peasants, and change into a new consciousness that values labor and respects working people. At the same time, we must also abandon the over-cautious inferiority complex that has been cultivated under reactionary rule for a long time. We must clearly recognize that every word of the Common Program is to be fully realized. Under the guidance of the Common Program, the people are completely equal and have full freedom and rights. Between the people and the people, and between the people and the government, it is entirely possible to reason according to the Common Program, and it can be explained clearly. With these two understandings, the national bourgeoisie can sincerely accept the leadership of the Communist Party and the working class in politics, and can correctly and satisfactorily establish public-private relations and labor-capital relations in business.

　　Now, militarily, Hainan Island has been basically liberated. This symbolizes that the liberation of Taiwan is not only entirely possible, but will happen soon. The enemy's blockade and sabotage can soon be completely smashed. The malicious propaganda of the imperialists gloating over misfortunes and the malicious rumors of the bandits and special agents can be defeated without attacking. Those speculators who believed in the enemy's counter-propaganda and arbitrarily hoarded goods for speculation have already suffered significant losses under the price decline and have gone bankrupt one after another. In the future, no one should believe the enemy's nonsense again. Of course, in this major change, legitimate industrialists and business people will also encounter major difficulties, and a few will even fall into stagnation. But everyone must recognize that today's difficulties are shared by the whole country, both public and private organizations. It is completely different from the reactionary regime plundering the people to enrich itself. At the same time, today's difficulties are temporary, difficulties in victory, and are completely different from the people suffering endlessly in the reactionary dark ages, and the suffering getting deeper and deeper. As far as the current situation is concerned, no one can deny that prices have stabilized, and price stability is the foundation of the people's happiness.

　　With the foundation of price stability, the Central People's Government has been able to further adjust the relationship between public and private enterprises and between various enterprise departments, so that everyone can get what they need and work together to develop production and prosper the economy. This great work is already underway. Not allowing prices to continue to fall, and it has already been done; the promise made by the central financial and economic负责人 on April 14 has been fulfilled. Further measures will certainly also be able to guarantee production profits, help legitimate industrialists and business people reduce suffering, and overcome difficulties.

　　This is truly an unprecedented great new era! The country is already an independent, free, democratic, and unified new country. After adjustment, industrial and commercial enterprises can massively promote the restoration of production work, and the country can further transition from poverty and weakness to prosperity and strength. In this great era, the field for industrialists and business people to develop production and prosper the economy is very broad. Industrialists and business people who have confidence in politics and determination in their careers should provide all their strength to quickly formulate new business plans to welcome this great new era! Patriotic, active, confident, and determined entrepreneurs should use their indomitable entrepreneurial spirit to overcome the current difficulties and strive for future development. Such entrepreneurs will never fail in the new era and will be respected by all the people.

　　Therefore, our national industrialists and business people must also learn the revolutionary spirit of the working class today, and use their own entrepreneurial spirit to match the revolutionary spirit of the working class, and use their own abilities and resources to match the labor of the working class. With the leadership of the Communist Party, Chinese national industrialists and business people are able to do so. Such efforts are eternally immortal.

    五一告工商业家书
    号召学习工人阶级革命精神，贡献全部力量，在国营经济领导下，为新国家经济建设而努力。
    【新华社一日讯】民主建国会顷发表“五一劳动节谨告全国工商业家”书一件，全文如下：
    今天是中华人民共和国开国以后第一次的伟大五一劳动节。虽然新国家还存在着不可避免的许多困难，民族工商业也同样的处于这种困难当中，但我们显然已经是一个独立自由、民主统一的国家的人民。这是我们过去多少年来寤寐以求的地位，现在居然得到了。我们应该为这一个难得的地位而欢欣鼓舞——从这一个地位展望前途，光明是无可限量的。我们更应该为前途的光明而奠定充分的信心！
    谁给与我们今天的地位？这就必须衷心的感激领导的阶级——工人阶级，领导的党——中国共产党无比正确的领导了中国人民民主革命；必须衷心感激人民解放军无比英勇的用他们的血肉争取到革命战争的胜利和全国的基本解放！在这一个伟大的革命当中，我们民族工商业家所尽的力量是十分薄弱的，是应该表示疚歉的。
    毛主席提出了“公私兼顾，劳资两利”的口号，给我们民族工商业家以献身祖国，共同努力建设新国家的光荣任务和光明出路。中共中央颁发的庆祝五一劳动节口号，再一次的提出“坚决贯彻公私兼顾，劳资两利的政策，欢迎民族资产阶级投资发展有利国计民生的生产事业”和“全国工人阶级团结一致，联合民族资产阶级，协力渡过暂时困难，争取经济状况逐步好转”的文句，会使得我们民族工商业家更加感激，更加兴奋，我们民族工商业家必须紧紧的把握时机，诚心诚意的接受领导阶级和领导党所给与我们的光荣任务，贡献全部的力量，在国营经济的领导之下，为新国家的经济建设而努力！今后人民政府对于有利国计民生的生产事业，一定会给它们更具体的帮助和保障。
    在这一个伟大的节日，我们民族工商业家必须好好的学习劳动创造世界的真理，完全肃清那些看不起劳动、看不起工农的落后意识残余，改变成重视劳动、尊敬劳动人民的新意识。同时还必须放弃过去长时期的在反动统治下所养成的那种过度警戒的自卑心理，要确切的认识共同纲领的每一句每一字都是要十足兑现的，在共同纲领的指导之下，人民是完全平等而且是有充分的自由权利的。人民与人民之间，人民与政府之间，都完全是可以根据共同纲领来讲道理，而且是讲得清楚的。有了这两种认识，民族资产阶级才能在政治上诚心诚意的接受中共和工人阶级的领导，才能在业务上正确的圆满的建立公私关系和劳资关系。
    现在，军事上又已经基本的解放海南岛，这象征着台湾的解放不但是完全可能，而且为日无多，敌人的封锁和破坏不久就可以完全击破。财经工作上已经由争取到国家收支接近平衡而达到通货膨胀的基本停止。帝国主义者们幸灾乐祸的恶意宣传和匪特的恶意造谣，都可以不攻自破了。那些相信敌人反宣传而恣意囤积居奇的投机家，已经在物价下跌下遭受了重大的损失，纷纷破产，今后应该不会有人再相信敌人的鬼话了。当然，在这个大变局当中，正当的工商业者也会遇到重大困难的，而且有少数也会陷于停顿的。但大家必须认清，今天的困难是全国上下，公私机关共同的，它完全不同于反动政权的掠夺人民以肥硕自己。同时，今天的困难是一时的、胜利中的困难，也完全不同于反动黑暗时代人民受尽痛苦而痛苦愈深。就以目前情况而论，谁都不能否认，物价已经稳定，而物价稳定正是人民幸福的基础。
    有了物价稳定的基础，中央人民政府已经可能进一步的调整公私企业之间和各个企业部门之间的关系，使大家各得其所，共同努力，为发展生产、繁荣经济而努力。这个伟大的工作已在进行。不使物价继续下跌这一点，而且已经做到了；中央财经负责人四月十四日的诺言已经兑现了。进一步的措施，必然还可以做到保证生产利润，帮助正当工商业家减少痛苦，渡过难关。
    这真是一个空前伟大的新时代！国家已经是一个独立、自由、民主统一的新国家，工商业经过调整之后，恢复生产工作可以大量的推进，国家可以进一步由贫弱转入富强。在这个大时代里面，工商业家发展生产，繁荣经济的领域是很广大的。对政治有信心，对事业有决心的工商业家，应该提供全力赶快订定新的事业计划，迎接这一个伟大的新时代！爱国的、积极的、有信心、有决心的事业家，应该以百折不挠的企业精神，挣过目前的难关，争取未来的发展。这种事业家在新时代里是永远不会失败，而且能为全体人民所敬爱的。
    因此，我们民族工商业家在今天还必须学习工人阶级的革命精神，要用自己的企业精神去配合工人阶级的革命精神，要用自己的能力和资力去配合工人阶级的劳力。有了共产党的领导，中国民族工商业家是能够这样做的。这样的努力是永远不朽的。
