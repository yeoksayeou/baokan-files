    [Xinhua News Agency, North Vietnam, 21st dispatch] According to Vietnam News Agency, North Vietnam, 20th: Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, recently sent a letter to the National Assembly, the government, people's organizations, and all Vietnamese people in the liberated areas, French-occupied areas, and abroad, thanking them for the congratulatory letters, telegrams, and gifts sent on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday. President Ho Chi Minh wrote in the letter: "As we are preparing for a comprehensive general counter-offensive, China, the Soviet Union, and other people's democratic countries have recognized us. In our history, our country's international status has never been as glorious as it is today. Eight hundred million friends are watching us and are looking forward to the victory that we are sure to achieve. Therefore, I hope that all soldiers and compatriots will abide by their promises, strive wholeheartedly for victory, and compete to complete the government's general mobilization plan.
