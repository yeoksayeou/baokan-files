　　Improving Business Methods to Overcome Current Temporary Difficulties
　　Partial Private Enterprises Implement Joint Ventures
　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Some private industrialists and merchants in Beijing, recognizing the new situation of stable prices, have created favorable conditions for operating businesses that are indeed beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. They are expanding their business scale through methods such as joint ventures and cooperative operations, and are investing commercial capital into industrial production. This not only overcomes the current temporary difficulties but also opens up prospects for development in management.
　　China Scientific Enterprise Co., Ltd. is a new enterprise formed through a joint venture. The company officially opened on the first of this month. It was formed by merging the First Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory, the Industrial Zhi Xing Society, the Sanhe Scientific Company, and the Zhonglian Scientific Supplies Store. These four entities already had business connections, all being involved in the production or distribution of chemical drugs and scientific instruments. After the joint venture, the company has more than 150 employees and has obtained the following advantageous conditions in management:

　　China Scientific Company Gains Favorable Conditions in Management after Joint Venture
　　(1) Increased Capital: After asset verification, the total capital of the four entities reaches two billion yuan, resolving the difficulties in capital turnover that existed when operating separately. At the same time, the expanded scale after the joint venture makes it easier to attract capital, and business management is also easier to improve. (2) Concentrated Strength, Division of Labor and Cooperation: For example, the original two factories can now focus on production, improve product quality, and reduce costs, without having to run around selling goods. The original two commercial departments can leverage their sales experience and also invest surplus commercial capital into production. (3) Harmonized Use of Factory Buildings, Machinery, and Tools: For example, the glass factory previously lacked a laboratory for ingredient mixing and finished product inspection. After the joint venture, it can use the pharmaceutical factory's laboratory. In addition, the strength of the accounting department has also been enhanced, which makes it possible to gradually improve the accounting system. Furthermore, the reduction in management expenses is also a benefit of the joint venture. The company is currently gradually expanding production. In the near future, it will complete the installation of a gas generator for the gas processing department, using gas instead of kerosene and gasoline as fuel for glass instruments, which will not only reduce costs but also increase output by two times. In terms of product sales, in addition to 60 percent being regular orders from various public and private enterprises, the self-made and self-sold portion is also increasing due to the large demand from factories, mines, schools, and organizations. Sui Jingren, the person in charge of the company, is very confident in the future of the joint venture, saying, "After the joint venture, we have relatively advanced scale equipment and can carry out production according to plan, in line with the development of national economic construction. Of course, there are still some difficulties, but as long as we put in the effort to find solutions, we can overcome them completely."

　　To Concentrate Capital and Improve Equipment, Xinfu and Other Factories are Planning Joint Operations
　　Jinli Electric Motor Factory and Tiancheng and Desheng Iron Factories are preparing to merge into a factory specializing in electric motors. The total number of employees is more than 70, with a total of 25 lathes and more than 100 million yuan in working capital. Among the three factories, Jinli is good at drafting design and business management; Tiancheng has a large factory building and many machines; and Desheng is rich in practical technical experience. After the joint venture, they can complement each other's strengths, making them a complete factory. In the machinery industry, Xinfu, Lihua, and Gongmao factories are also planning joint operations. The plan has been drafted and it has been decided to focus on manufacturing agricultural machinery such as rice threshers, rice milling machines, and straw rope machines for the countryside. After the above factories adopt joint ventures or cooperative operations, the scale of production will expand from small to large, and they can concentrate the use of funds and improve technical equipment, which is in line with the trend of industrial development. As long as the investors have firm confidence and actively manage, they will surely have a promising future.

　　In addition, some factories are shifting from commercial to industrial operations, or industry has absorbed commercial capital. For example, the investors in Guangming Light Bulb Industrial Cooperative were originally engaged in businesses such as hotels and fur. Now they have raised 150 million yuan in capital and purchased vacuum machines, sealing machines, and mandrel machines from the Northeast, preparing to produce light bulbs. They are currently testing their products and will soon officially open for business. Yongfeng Chemical Factory specializes in calcium carbonate. Since the import of calcium carbonate products has decreased, the sales of the factory's products have been brisk. Recently, it has absorbed some capital and added air pumps, water pumps, and other machines in order to expand production.

　　Dahua and Other Five Soap Factories Jointly Operate and Achieve Surplus
　　[Reported by This Newspaper] The Beijing Soap Joint Operation Society implements democratic management, and labor and management frequently negotiate to solve various difficulties. The production enthusiasm of workers has increased. The quality of the soap produced has been improved, the cost has been reduced, and the quantity of production and sales has gradually increased, turning from losses to surpluses. The society was jointly organized by Dahua, Youxin, Lizhong, Chenguang, and Xinchang and other five soap factories during the period of declining soap sales last year. It officially started operations in late October last year, manufacturing Beijing brand soap and medicated soap.

　　Before the joint operation, the aforementioned factories suffered from weak capital, substandard products, improper management methods, large expenses, and high costs, resulting in blocked sales and depressed business. After the joint operation, the society first improved management methods; reduced redundant personnel (from 34 to 18); unified the use of funds; and unified the purchase of raw materials. In this way, the cost of soap was 15 percent lower than when the factories operated separately. Now, the society uses the hot-process settling method to make soap, and the quality has been greatly improved. In the soap appraisal of the industry association, it was rated as the first-class product of hot-process settling soap. Although the cost of the product is 2 percent higher than before due to the more complex settling process, the overall cost is 13 percent lower than before. In January of this year, the society produced 420 boxes of soap and sold 430 boxes (95 percent sold in this city, 5 percent in other places). In March, it produced 752 boxes and sold 736 boxes (60 percent sold in this city, 40 percent in other places). In April, due to the reduction of orders from public enterprises, the output and sales volume dropped to 480 boxes (58 percent sold in this city, 42 percent in other places). Therefore, how to open up the rural market in the future is still an important issue.

　　The society only needs to sell 400 boxes of soap per month to cover expenses, and it has consistently had a surplus since the joint operation. At present, national prices have stabilized. The investors are more confident in the future of the business.

　　改善经营方式克服目前暂时困难
    部分私营企业实行合营
    【京市新闻处讯】京市部分私营工商业家认识到物价平稳的新局面，对经营确实有利于国计民生的事业创造了有利条件，正以合营、联营等方式，扩大经营规模，并以商业资金投入工业生产，不但可以克服目前的暂时困难，且在经营上开辟了发展的前途。
    中华科学企业股份有限公司就是合营的新企业。该公司已于本月一日开业。该公司系由第一化学制药厂、工业知行社、三和科学公司和中联科学用品商行四个单位合并而成。这四个单位原来就有业务联系，彼此都是生产或经售化学药品、科学仪器的。合营以后共有职工一百五十余人，且获得了下述在经营上有利的条件：
    合营的中华科学公司经营上获得有利条件
    （一）资金增多：四个单位现在清查资产，全部资金可达二十亿元，解决了分散经营时资金周转的困难，同时合营后规模扩大，易吸收资金，经营管理也容易改进；（二）力量集中，分工合作：如原来的两工厂现在可以专心致力生产，提高产品质量，降低成本，不必为销售货品而奔走，原来两商业部门则可以发挥推销经验，还可把富余商业资金投入生产；（三）调剂使用厂房、机器、工具等设备，如玻璃厂在配料、检验成品方面过去缺少试验室，合营后可以使用制药厂的试验室；此外，会计部门的力量也增强了，这就可能逐渐健全会计制度；又如管理费用的节省等也是合营后的好处。该公司现正逐步扩展生产，近期内可把瓦斯加工部煤气发生炉按装完成，做玻璃仪器所用的燃料，以煤气代替煤油、汽油，成本既可减低，产量又能增加两倍。产品销路方面，除去有百分之六十是各公私营企业的经常订货外，自制自销部分由于工矿、学校、团体的大量需要也有增加。该公司负责人隋经仁对合营前途很有信心，他说：“合营后有了比较进步的规模设备，能按计划进行生产，配合国家经济建设发展业务。当然也还有些困难，但只要花费气力想办法就能完全克服。”
    为了集中资金改进设备信孚等工厂正筹划联营
    金利电机工厂与天成、德生两铁工厂准备合营成专作电机的工厂，全部职工有七十余人，共有车床二十五部，流动资金一亿余元。三工厂中，金利善于制图设计和经营管理；天成厂房大、机器多；德生富有实际技术经验。合营之后，相互取长补短，正好成为完整工厂。机器业中还有信孚、利华、公茂三工厂也在筹划联营，计划书已拟定，决定生产面向农村，专从事制造打稻机、碾米机、草绳机等农业机器。以上各工厂采取合营或联营后，生产规模由小到大，可以集中使用资金，改进技术设备，是符合工业发展趋向的，只要资方坚定信心，积极经营，必有发展前途。
    另外，还有一些工厂系由商业转向工业经营，或是工业吸收了商业资金，如光明电灯泡工业社的资方原来是经营旅店、皮毛等业的，现已筹集资金一亿五千万元，自东北购来真空机、封口机、信管机等机器，准备生产灯泡，正试验出品，即将正式开业，永丰化学工厂专做碳酸钙，自碳酸钙舶来品进口减少后，该厂产品销路畅旺，最近吸收一部资金，添置气泵、水泵等机器以便扩大生产。
    大华等五家肥皂厂联合经营获得盈余
    【本报讯】北京肥皂联营社实行民主管理，劳资双方经常协商，解决各种困难。工人生产情绪提高。所产肥皂品质已经改良，成本减低，产销数量逐步增加，由亏累转向盈余。该社是在去年肥皂销路萎缩期间，由大华、又新、利中、晨光、信昌等五家肥皂厂联合组织起来的。由去年十月下旬正式开办，制造北京牌肥皂及药皂。
    联营以前，前述各厂由于资金薄弱，产品不够标准，管理方法不当，开支大，成本高，致销路闭塞，营业消沉。联营之后，该社首先改进了管理方法；缩减了冗员（由三十四人，减缩到十八人）；统一运用资金；统一购买原料；这样，肥皂成本比各厂分散经营时节省百分之十五。现在，该社采用热制分水法制肥皂，质量大为提高，在同业公会肥皂鉴定中，被评为热制分水肥皂甲等一级品。虽因分水比较复杂，产品成本较前提高百分之二，但总的来说，成本较前减低了百分之十三。本年一月份该社生产肥皂四二○箱，销四三○箱（销本市百分之九十五，外埠百分之五）。三月份生产七五二箱，销七三六箱（销本市百分之六十，外埠百分之四十）。四月份因公营企业订货减少，产、销量降至四八○箱销（本市百分之五十八，外埠百分之四十二）。因此，今后如何打开农村销路，还是一个重要的问题。
    该社每月销四百箱肥皂就够开支，联营以来始终有盈余。目前全国物价已趋稳定。资方对经营前途更充满信心。
