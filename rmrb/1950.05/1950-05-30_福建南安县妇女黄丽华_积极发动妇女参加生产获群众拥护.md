Fujian Nan'an County Woman Huang Lihua

Actively Mobilizes Women to Participate in Production, Gaining Popular Support

Huang Lihua, a woman representative from Tangshang Bao Village, Tenth District, Nan'an County, Fujian, returned to the village on April 24th from the county's Second People's Representative Conference. That evening, despite her fatigue, she immediately began to publicize the significance of the People's Representative Conference to the masses. She also mobilized the masses to carry out central work. The next evening, she convened a women's conference and immediately initiated the establishment of a women's association. Since having an organization, forty-eight women have voluntarily joined work exchange teams to help each other with labor. Under Huang Lihua's leadership, women's work in this village has flourished, thereby promoting work in nearby villages. For example, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Lingdou Village Farmers' Association, upon hearing this news, actively sought out district cadres to request that Huang Lihua organize a women's association in their village. The district comrade said: Huang Lihua is not a district cadre, how will her living expenses be resolved? The chairman of the Lingdou Village Farmers' Association said: As long as Comrade Huang comes to our village to work, our village will be responsible for her living expenses. The district comrade agreed to the request of the Lingdou Village Farmers' Association and immediately sent a letter to Huang Lihua, asking her to conduct women's work in Lingdou Village.

After receiving the letter, Huang Lihua immediately set off to Lingdou Village to mobilize women to organize a women's association. Other villages, upon hearing this news, also requested her to mobilize women's work in their villages. Therefore, Huang Lihua went from one village to another to carry out work and organize women's associations. From April 25th to May 8th, in half a month, she established six women's associations in nearby villages, with 625 members, of whom 162 women voluntarily joined women's work exchange teams.

　　福建南安县妇女黄丽华
    积极发动妇女参加生产获群众拥护
    福建南安县十区塘上保村妇女代表黄丽华，四月二十四日从县二届人民代表会返村后，当天晚上不顾疲倦，即向群众宣传人民代表会的意义。并在群众中进行动员，通过群众来开展中心工作。第二天晚上召开了妇女大会，当场发动成立了妇女会。妇女自从有了组织后，即有四十八个妇女自动参加了变工队，互助做活。这个村的妇女工作，在黄丽华的领导下就蓬勃地开展了起来，并因此推动了附近各村的工作。如岭兜村农会正副主席听见了这个消息，即积极去找区干部，要求黄丽华到本村组织妇女会。区上同志说：黄丽华不是区干部，她的生活供给怎样解决？岭兜村农会主席说：只要黄同志到我村工作，生活费用由我们村负责。区上同志答应了岭兜村农会的要求，立即给黄丽华去信，要她到岭兜村进行妇女工作。
    黄丽华接信后就马上动身到岭兜村，发动妇女组织妇女会。其它村听到了这个消息，也来要求她到本村发动妇女工作。于是黄丽华就从一个村到一个村的进行工作，组织妇女会。从四月二十五号开始到五月八号，半月中在附近各村成立了六个妇女会，会员六百二十五人，其中一百六十二个妇女自动参加了妇女变工队。
