　　Shanghai's Private Banks and Credit Agencies Gradually Improve: Bad Debts Gradually Recovered, Loans Being Granted

[Shanghai News] According to the Shanghai Liberation Daily, Shanghai's private banks and credit agencies are showing signs of improvement. The stagnation of lending has stopped, and losses will be greatly reduced.

After the "February 6th" bandit air raid in Shanghai, industry and commerce gradually experienced difficulties. Many factories suspended operations or reduced production, business declined sharply, and bad debts became extremely common, resulting in huge losses. Recently, thanks to labor-management consultations to maintain production, and the support of state bank loans and large-scale processing and ordering by specialized companies, the difficulties are gradually being overcome. As a result, the business situation of private banks and credit agencies is also showing improvement compared to the past. This is primarily reflected in the fact that the temporary stagnation of lending by various banks and agencies has stopped developing, and some can even be recovered. Some are already in contact to repay or pay interest and extend the term. For example, the bad debts of the Continental Bank have decreased from 2 billion yuan to 1.6 billion yuan, the bad debts of the Guohua Bank have been recovered by half, the loans of the Y盐业 Bank to the Tianjin Cement Factory have recovered one-third, the loans of the Zhejiang First Bank to the Great China Match Factory have been extended with interest payment, and the Jingang Company has taken the initiative to contact the Jincheng Bank to discuss loan repayment methods. In addition, the lending business of various banks and agencies is also more active than before. For example, the lending of the Juxingcheng Bank has increased from 2.8 billion yuan at the end of April to 3.9 billion yuan. Recently, it also granted a loan of 500 million yuan to the Qianghua Shipping Company. The lending of the United Bank increased by 1.3 billion yuan, the lending ratio of Zhejiang First Bank increased from 40% to 60%, and in addition to jointly providing a huge loan to the Xinyu Yarn Factory with the Zhongnan Bank, the Jincheng Bank also launched small industrial and commercial loans, receiving more than 400 applications in one day, and is currently conducting investigations and negotiations. In addition, Zhongnan Bank signed overdraft contracts with more than 100 industrial and commercial households within half a month.

In terms of deposits, since May, all private banks and credit agencies have generally increased by 10% to 20-30%. The Continental Bank and the Y盐业 Bank have increased by 30% in the past 20 days, most of which are industrial and commercial transactions. Deposits in the Jincheng Bank were 13 billion yuan on April 1st, and approached 20 billion yuan around the 20th. Deposits in the Juxingcheng Bank more than doubled compared to March.

Currently, the losses of various banks and agencies have been significantly reduced. In the past, due to the small amount of lending, the income and expenditure of deposit interest formed a reverse difference. Now, due to the reduction of interest rates, the burden of deposit interest is reduced, and as lending increases, interest income also increases. At the same time, the People's Bank of China has also increased the interest on interbank short-term deposits, encouraging banks and agencies to deposit and increasing their income. Therefore, the reverse difference no longer exists, and the deficit in May will be greatly reduced. Some banks and agencies can still strive for a balance of payments.

The improvement of the business of various banks and agencies is inseparable from the labor-management agreement and the confidence of the capital side. For example, the Jincheng Bank's establishment of small industrial and commercial loans has made the improvement most significant. One of the reasons is that the labor and management of the bank can meet frankly, actively develop business, and the capital side has eliminated and corrected the past wrong idea that "cooperating with policies is the most disadvantageous." Current facts have proven that as long as various banks and agencies can actively cooperate with the government and vigorously support the production industry, the improvement will be more rapid. Especially after the liberation of Zhoushan, the conditions are even more favorable. The persons in charge of various banks and agencies are also extremely excited about this, just as one capitalist said: "The most difficult period has passed."

　　沪私营行庄渐趋好转
    呆账逐渐收回、放款正在开展
    【上海讯】据上海解放日报消息：沪市私营行庄已有好转迹象，放款呆滞情况已停止发展，亏损将大为减低。
    沪市私营行庄自“二·六”匪机轰炸后，工商业逐步感受困难，不少工厂停工和减产，业务曾一度低落，放款发生呆账极为普遍，致造成巨大亏损。最近由于各行业在劳资协商维持生产、国家银行贷款与专业公司大量的加工、订货扶植下，困难已在逐步克服。因之私营行庄业务情况亦显示较前好转。这首先表现在各行庄放款的暂时呆滞已停止发展，甚至已可以收回一部分，有的已在接洽偿还或付息转期。如大陆银行的放款呆账已从二十亿元减为十六亿元，国华银行呆账已收回了一半，盐业银行放给天津水泥厂的放款已收回三分之一，浙江第一银行的大中华火柴厂的放款已付息转期，金刚公司主动与金城银行接洽贷款偿还办法。另外，各行庄放款业务亦较前开展，如聚兴诚银行放款已由四月底的二十八亿元增为三十九亿元，日前尚贷给强华轮船公司一笔五亿元的贷款。联合银行的放款增加了十三亿元，浙江第一银行的放款比例由百分之四十增至百分之六十，金城银行除与中南银行联合对新裕纱厂进行了巨额的放款外，还创办小型工商业贷款，一天内即收到申请书四百余份，现正进行调查洽放。另中南银行半月内与一百余户工商业订立了透支契约。
    私营行庄存款方面，自五月份以来，皆普遍增加一成至二三成不等，大陆银行与盐业银行二十天来增加了三成，其中大部分为工商业往来，金城银行存款四月一日为一百三十亿元，到二十号左右即接近二百亿元，聚兴诚银行存款比三月份增加一倍以上。
    目前各行庄的亏损已显著减少。过去因放款少，存放利息的收支形成逆差，现在则因利率降低，存款利息负担减轻，放款增加后，利息收入也随着增加。同时，人民银行又提高同业短期存款利息，鼓励行庄存款，并且增加了收益，因而逆差已不再存在，五月份的赤字将大为减低。有些行庄尚可争取收支平衡。
    各行庄业务的好转，是与各该行劳资协议情况及资方有无信心不可分开。如金城银行创办小型工商业贷款使好转情况最为显著，其原因之一便是该行劳资双方能开诚相见、积极开展业务与资方扫除和纠正了过去“配合政策最吃亏”的错误思想的结果。目前事实已经证明，各行庄只要能积极配合政府，大力扶助生产事业，好转当更能迅速。特别是舟山解放以后，条件更加有利，各行庄负责人对此亦极表兴奋，正如一位资方所说：“最困难的时期已经过去了。”
