Introducing Recent Issues of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" Chinese Edition
	Wang Zongyi

"For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" is the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties and a guiding publication for the international revolutionary movement. The Chinese edition of this publication began in October 1949 and has now been published up to the thirty-third issue (total seventy-second issue). The publication regularly features articles introducing the party-building experiences of the workers' parties in various countries, as well as their experiences in struggling against domestic and foreign reactionaries and leading the construction of people's states, as well as articles exposing the conspiratorial activities of reactionaries in various countries around the world. The Chinese working class and the Chinese people, who are engaged in consolidating and building their own country, can draw many beneficial experiences and lessons from this publication.

In order to give those who have not yet read this publication a general understanding of its content, here is a brief introduction to the main content of the Chinese edition from the twenty-first issue to the thirty-third issue (total sixtieth issue to the seventy-second issue).

The editorial in the twenty-fifth issue (total sixty-fourth issue), "The Great Progress of the National Liberation Movement in Colonies and Dependent Countries," discusses the experience of the Chinese revolution and the path for colonial peoples to strive for national liberation. The article reiterates the argument made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi in his opening speech at the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference (which was published in the sixtieth issue, i.e., the twenty-first issue of the Chinese edition) that "The path of the Chinese people... is the path that the people of many colonial and semi-colonial countries should take in striving for national independence and people's democracy." The article clearly points out: "A decisive condition for the national liberation struggle to achieve victorious results is the organization of the People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Communist Party when the necessary internal conditions permit." It also states: "The examples of China, Vietnam, Malaya, and other countries show that armed struggle is now becoming the main form of the national liberation movement in many colonies and dependent countries." After this editorial was published, Indian Communist Party General Secretary Ranadive issued a statement expressing his acceptance of the editorial's view that the Indian people should learn from the lessons of the Chinese revolution.

The article "On the Situation in Japan" published in the twenty-second issue (total sixty-first issue) criticized the erroneous theory of Japanese Communist Party leaders Nozaka Sanzo and others that Japan could "peacefully transition to socialism" under American occupation. This article helped the Japanese Communist Party to correct its mistakes in a timely manner.

The article "On the Situation of the Norwegian Communist Party" by Norwegian Communist Party Chairman Løvlien in the twenty-sixth issue (total sixty-fifth issue) discusses the party's victory in overcoming bourgeois nationalist tendencies within the party. The article points out that the anti-Party sectarian group headed by former Norwegian Communist Party General Secretary Furubotn implemented a bourgeois nationalist policy during and after World War II. The characteristic of this policy was to shift from a class stance to a nationalist stance, subordinating the interests of the party to "national interests" and subordinating the combat organizations established by the party to the government in exile and bourgeois representatives. The Norwegian Communist Party conducted a fierce struggle with Furubotn in October 1949 and successively expelled Furubotn and several other anti-Party elements from the party. The article points out that Furubotn's political views were not an accidental phenomenon and were ideologically and politically connected to the Tito group. Therefore, an urgent task facing the Norwegian Communist Party was to eliminate anti-Party elements and consolidate its ranks ideologically and organizationally. In order to further consolidate the party's organization, the Norwegian Communist Party held a special representative conference in February of this year. After the conference, Løvlien published another article, "The Norwegian Communist Party Consolidates Its Ranks" (see total seventy-first issue, Chinese edition thirty-second issue). This article explains that the representative conference, composed of representatives elected from various regions of the country, "thoroughly negated Furubotn's anti-Marxist views on national issues, peasant issues, and the role of the Communist Party, and pointed out that completely eliminating the Furubotn group within the party and the workers' movement is extremely necessary and a prerequisite for the further development of the Norwegian Communist Party as the leader and organizer of the Norwegian working class struggle." The representative conference unanimously adopted the Norwegian Communist Party Central Committee's draft resolution on this issue.

The article "On the Question of the Unity of the Polish Working Class" by Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee Secretary Zawadzki in the twenty-first issue (total sixtieth issue) narrates the course of overcoming the right-wing nationalist tendency represented by former party General Secretary Gomulka. The article points out that in June 1948, Gomulka took advantage of the Polish Workers' Party's preparation to merge with the Polish Socialist Party into the Polish United Workers' Party to attempt to seize the party suddenly, putting forward a merger program for the two parties that amounted to surrendering to social democracy, and attempting to bring the right wing of the Socialist Party into the unified party. At the plenary session of the Polish Workers' Party Central Committee held in July and August 1948, a struggle was launched against Gomulka, crushing the right-wing nationalist tendency. Subsequently, a huge purge was carried out, removing a large number of class alien elements and hostile elements from the Polish Workers' Party and the Socialist Party. Only after this was the merger of the two parties into a unified party able to be established on a correct basis. The article points out that the common source of right-wing and nationalist tendencies and Polish social democracy is anti-Russian and anti-Soviet nationalism – which the Polish bourgeoisie has manufactured among the petty bourgeoisie and some workers for decades. Eliminating this source and its consequences requires a long-term and tenacious struggle.

The article "Lessons Learned from Exposing and Eliminating the Traicho Kostov Gang" by Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee Secretary Chervenkov in the twenty-eighth issue (total sixty-seventh issue) makes an important discussion of the experience and lessons of the Kostov incident. The Kostov Trotskyite spy group took the form of left-leaning sectarianism, which is different from the right-leaning opportunist form taken by anti-Party sectarian groups within the Norwegian Communist Party and the Polish Workers' Party, but its harm to the workers' parties in these countries is equally serious. Chervenkov's article points out that the main reason why the Bulgarian Workers' Party failed to uncover Kostov and his accomplices hiding in the party for a long time was that a wrong view was prevalent within the Bulgarian Communist Party, and for a long time all the practical activities of the Bulgarian Communist Party were encumbered by this view. This view held that after the revolution of September 9, 1944 in Bulgaria, the class struggle would further subside, and it would be possible to organically transition to socialism without the dictatorship of the proletariat, relying solely on the quantitative and gradual increase in the achievements of national construction. Thus, the inevitability of the sharpening of class struggle in the period of transition from capitalism to socialism was underestimated, the strength of the reactionaries was underestimated, and the vigilance of the people was paralyzed. Based on the lessons of the Kostov incident, Chervenkov put forward methods to improve the work of the party in the article to strengthen the party and ensure that the country advances along the socialist road.

Communist Party of Czechoslovakia Central Committee member Köbrliwa stated in "Revolutionary Vigilance and the Struggle for the Purity of the Ranks of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia" (thirty-first issue): "We must fight on a larger and more resolute scale against the spies, saboteurs, and terrorists who have been sent from the West and have infiltrated our ranks." He also pointed out that in order to ensure the purity of the party, criticism and self-criticism is an important weapon. He said: "Our most important and urgent task is to fight ruthlessly against any hostile attempts to suppress criticism and self-criticism, to resolutely oppose all forms of commandism and profiteering, and to fight against everything that makes the party impure and paralyzes its vigilance."

In these issues, there are articles such as "The Distribution and Redistribution of National Income in Poland" by Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee member Enderlichowski (twenty-second issue), "Hungary Completes Industrial Nationalization" by Hungarian Workers' Party Central Committee member Friis (twenty-third issue), "The Unified Agricultural Cooperatives of Czechoslovakia" by Czech Communist Party General Secretary Slansky (thirty-second issue), and "The Fiscal Policy of the People's Democratic Countries" by Romanian Workers' Party Central Committee Secretary Luca (thirty-third issue), which introduce important experiences in the economic construction of the People's Democratic countries. These experiences are also of great reference value for our Chinese economic workers.

The situation of the Tito gang acting as running dogs of American imperialism and engaging in sabotage activities in the workers' movements of various countries is constantly being exposed in this publication in a stern and timely manner. The articles by Rossi and Xie Jia in the twenty-first and thirty-second issues (total sixtieth and seventy-first issues) point out that one of the methods used by American imperialism in Italy to oppose the laboring people is to cultivate agents of the Tito gang. The Tito group seeks allies among the Italian bourgeoisie against the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries and tries its best to spread confusion and corruption in the ranks of the Italian Communist Party, Socialist Party, and democratic movement. However, the continued growth of the organizational strength of the Italian Communist Party shows the collapse of the agents of the Tito gang. Italian Communist Party Deputy Secretary Xie Jia's article also pointed out that "the constant struggle against the Tito group is part of the struggle for peace, independence, and freedom in Italy." In the twenty-third issue (total sixty-second issue), French Communist Party Central Committee member Cogniot's article pointed out that Tito's agents in France had planned to use more than 10,000 Yugoslav expatriates to infiltrate the Communist Party and mass organizations, but also suffered a miserable defeat. In the twenty-sixth issue (total sixty-fifth issue), Spanish Communist Party General Secretary Ibárruri's article revealed that the Tito clique is seeking support from the people who are profiting in the Spanish Republican government, and the fact that the Republican government awarded Tito a medal has helped Tito's secret service to carry out activities among Spanish expatriates and in Spain. The article demanded that the so-called Republican government, which has now completely separated from the Spanish people, resign and called for the establishment of a truly representative Spanish Republican government that severed any ties with the Tito gang. In the twenty-first issue (total sixtieth issue), Austrian Communist Party General Secretary Fürnberg's article pointed out that the Tito gang used its embassy in Austria to carry out dirty work. The embassy is actually a spy center. They have used "social gatherings" and "private banquets" to collect intelligence and recruit agents. They also cooperated closely with British agents to transport military supplies to Tito on the Austrian border. The above facts prove that the sabotage activities of the Tito gang are pervasive. Therefore, it must arouse the common vigilance of the revolutionary ranks of the working class in various countries around the world. What deserves our special attention is the editorial in the twenty-sixth issue, "American Imperialism Uses the Tito Group to Engage in Espionage Activities in Asia." This article timely revealed to the Asian people the sinister plan of the United States to use the Tito gang to sabotage the national liberation movements of the Asian countries. The article points out that, according to the orders of the US State Department, Belgrade is formulating an espionage plan centered on the Yugoslav Embassy in Delhi to counter the Communist Parties of various Asian countries and to disintegrate and sabotage the national liberation movements of these countries.

The above is the main content of the Chinese edition from the twenty-first issue to the thirty-third issue of "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" From these contents, it should not be difficult for us to see how important the guiding role of this publication "For Lasting Peace, For People's Democracy!" is for our revolutionary ranks.

　　介绍《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》中文版最近几期
    王宗一
    《争取持久和平，争取人民民主!》是共产党与工人党情报局的机关报，是国际革命运动的指导刊物。该刊中文版于一九四九年十月开始出版，现已出版至第三十三期（总第七十二期）。该刊经常登载介绍各国工人阶级政党的建党经验及这些政党与国内外反动派进行斗争和领导建设人民国家的经验的文章，以及揭露世界各国反动派的阴谋活动的文章。正在从事巩固和建设自己的国家的中国工人阶级和中国人民，可以从这个刊物中吸取许多有益的经验和教训。
    为了使尚未读过该刊的人大体了解它的内容起见，这里把该刊中文版第二十一期至第三十三期（总第六十期至第七十二期）的主要内容作一简单的介绍。
    第二十五期（总第六十四期）社论《殖民地与附属国民族解放运动的巨大进展》，论述了中国革命经验和殖民地人民争取民族解放的道路。该文重申了刘少奇同志在亚澳工会代表会议上的开幕词（该开幕词已于该刊第六十期即中文版第二十一期刊载）中的论点说：“中国人民……的道路，是许多殖民地半殖民地国家的人民争取民族独立和人民民主所应该走的道路。”该文明白指出：“民族解放斗争能够获得胜利的结果的一个决定性的条件，就是在必要的内部条件允许的时候，在共产党的领导之下组织人民解放军。”又说：“中国、越南、马来亚和其他国家的例子说明了武装斗争现在正成为许多殖民地与附属国民族解放运动的主要形式。”在这篇社论发表后，印度共产党总书记兰那地夫曾发表声明，表示接受该社论关于印度人民应当学习中国革命的教训的意见。
    第二十二期（总第六十一期）所载《关于日本的形势》一文，批评了日本共产党领导人野坂参三等人的所谓日本在美国占领下可以“和平转变到社会主义”的错误理论。这篇文章帮助日本共产党及时地纠正了自己的错误。
    第二十六期（总第六十五期）挪威共产党主席莱甫莲的《论挪威共产党的情况》一文，论述了该党胜利地克服党内资产阶级民族主义倾向的经过。该文指出：以挪共前总书记佛鲁波顿为首的反党宗派主义集团在第二次世界大战期间及战后实行了资产阶级民族主义政策。这一政策的特点，就是从阶级立场转变为民族主义立场，使党的利益服从于“民族利益”，使党所建立的战斗组织服从于流亡政府及资产阶级代表。挪共于一九四九年十月与佛鲁波顿进行了激烈的斗争，并将佛鲁波顿及其他若干反党分子陆续开除出党。该文指出：佛鲁波顿的政治观点不是一个偶然现象，它在思想上和政治上是和铁托集团有联系的。因此，挪威共产党所面临的一项紧急任务，即是清除反党分子，从思想上和组织上巩固自己的队伍。挪共为了进一步巩固党的组织，在今年二月举行了一次特别代表大会，会议后，莱甫莲又发表《挪共巩固自己的队伍》一文（见总第七十一期，中文版三十二期）。该文说明，由全国各地区所选出的代表组成的这次代表大会“彻底地否定了佛鲁波顿对于民族问题、农民问题与共产党作用问题之反马克思主义的观点，并且指出，在党与工人运动内完全肃清佛鲁波顿集团乃是极必需的事情，乃是挪威共产党作为挪威工人阶级斗争之领袖与组织者，是否能有进一步发展的先决条件。”这次代表大会一致通过了挪共党中央关于这一问题的决议草案。
    第二十一期（总第六十期）波兰统一工人党中央委员会书记萨瓦德斯基的《论波兰工人阶级统一问题》一文，叙述了以该党前总书记哥穆尔卡为代表的右的民族主义的倾向被克服的经过。该文指出：一九四八年六月哥穆尔卡曾利用波兰工人党准备和波兰社会党合并为波兰统一工人党的机会试图突然夺取党，提出了等于是对社会民主主义投降的两党合并纲领，并企图把社会党右翼也带入统一党内来。在一九四八年七月与八月召开的波兰工人党中央全会，展开了与哥穆尔卡的斗争，粉碎了右的民族主义的倾向。其后又进行了巨大的清党工作，把大批阶级异己分子和敌意分子从波兰工人党与社会党中清除出去。只有在这之后，两党的合并为统一党才得以建立在正确的基础上。该文指出：右的和民族主义的倾向以及波兰社会民主主义的共同源泉，是反俄和反苏的民族主义——这是波兰资产阶级几十年来在小资产阶级和部分工人中间所制造的。要消除这一源泉及其后果，需要进行长期的和顽强的斗争。
    第二十八期（总第六十七期）保加利亚共产党中央委员会书记契尔文科夫的《从破获特拉伊科·科斯托夫匪帮与消灭这一匪帮的斗争得出的教训》一文，对科斯托夫事件的经验教训作了重要的论述。科斯托夫这一托派间谍集团采取了左倾宗派主义的形式，这与挪威共产党和波兰工人党内的反党宗派集团所采取的右倾机会主义形式不同，但其对于这些国家的工人阶级政党的危害是同样严重的。契尔文科夫的文章指出：保加利亚工人党所以长时未能破获藏在党内的科斯托夫及其同谋者，其主要的原因，是在于保加利亚共产党内普遍存在着一个错误的观点，并且在一个颇长的时间内，保加利亚共产党的一切实际活动都为这个观点所累。这一观点认为保加利亚在一九四四年九月九日革命后，阶级斗争就会愈加减退，可以不要无产阶级专政，单凭国家建设成绩的量的以及渐变的增长，即可有机地过渡到社会主义。因而过低估计了在从资本主义过渡到社会主义的时期中阶级斗争尖锐化的不可避免性，过低估计了反动派的力量，麻痹了人民的警惕性。契尔文科夫根据科斯托夫事件的教训，在文中提出了改善党的工作方法，以加强党，并确保国家沿着社会主义的道路前进。
    捷共中央委员会委员柯勃里伐在《革命的警惕性及为捷克斯拉伐克共产党队伍的纯洁而斗争》（第三十一期）一文中指出：“我们必须在更大的和更坚决的规模上与自西方派来并已渗入我们队伍中的间谍、破坏者与恐怖分子作斗争。”他并指出，为了保证党的纯洁，批评与自我批评是一个重要武器。他说：“我们最重要而迫切的任务是无情地与压制批评与自我批评的任何敌对企图作斗争，坚决反对各种形式的发号施令与追求牟利的工作，与一切使党不纯及麻痹其警惕性的事情作斗争。”
    在这几期中，有波兰统一工人党中央委员恩得利赫夫斯基的《波兰国家收入的分配与再分配》（二十二期），匈牙利工人党中央委员弗利斯的《匈牙利完成工业国有化》（二十三期），捷克共产党总书记斯兰斯基的《捷克的统一农业合作社》（三十二期），罗马尼亚工人党中央委员会书记卢加的《人民民主国家的财政政策》（三十三期）等文，介绍了人民民主国家在经济建设方面的重要经验。这些经验对于我们中国的经济工作者，也是具有很大参考价值的。
    关于铁托匪帮充当美帝国主义的走狗在各国工人阶级运动中进行破坏活动的情形在这刊物上也不断地给予了严正的及时的揭发。第二十一期及第三十二期（总第六十及七十一期）罗西与谢嘉的文章指出美帝国主义在意大利反对劳动人民的方法之一就是培植铁托匪帮的代理人。铁托集团在意大利资产阶级中寻求反对苏联、反对人民民主国家的同盟者，并极力在意大利的共产党社会党和民主运动行列中散布混乱和腐化的思想。但意大利共产党的组织力量的继续壮大表明了铁托匪帮代理人的垮台。意共副书记谢嘉的文章中还指出，“对于铁托集团的不断斗争是为意大利的和平、独立与自由而斗争的一部分。”在第二十三期（总第六十二期）法共中央谷尼欧的文章指出：铁托在法国的代理人曾打算利用一万多南斯拉夫侨民打入共产党及群众组织中，但也遭到惨败。在第二十六期（总第六十五期）上，西班牙共产党总书记伊巴露丽的文章揭露：铁托之流正在从西班牙共和政府中的好利的人们中间寻求支持，而该共和政府授勋给铁托一事，正好帮助了铁托的特务机关在西班牙侨民和西班牙国内的活动。该文要求现已完全脱离西班牙人民群众的所谓共和政府辞职，并号召成立一个具有真正代表性的与铁托匪帮断绝任何联系的西班牙共和政府。在第二十一期（总第六十期）奥地利共产党总书记富伦堡的文章指出：铁托匪帮利用其大使馆在奥地利进行卑污工作，大使馆实际上是间谍中心，他们曾利用“社交集会”“私人宴会”搜集情报，招收代理人。他们并和英国特务密切合作，在奥地利边境向铁托输送军火。上面这些事实证明铁托匪帮的破坏活动是无孔不入的。因而必须引起世界各国工人阶级革命队伍的共同警惕。尤其值得我们注意的是第二十六期的社论《美帝利用铁托集团在亚洲从事间谍活动》一文。本文向亚洲人民及时地揭露了美国企图利用铁托匪帮破坏亚洲各国人民的民族解放运动的罪恶计划。该文指出：按照美国国务院的命令，贝尔格莱德正在制定一个以德里南斯拉夫大使馆为中心的间谍活动计划，来对抗亚洲各国共产党，来瓦解并破坏这些国家的民族解放运动。
    以上就是《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》中文版第二十一期至第三十三期的主要内容。从这些内容，我们当不难看出《争取持久和平，争取人民民主！》这个刊物对于我国革命队伍是有多么重要的指导作用了。
