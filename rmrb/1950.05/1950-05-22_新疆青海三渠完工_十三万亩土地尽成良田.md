　　Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, May 18th: The Xinshang Canal, 30 kilometers long in Shawan County, northern Xinjiang Province, the Taiping Canal, 20 kilometers long, and the Changsheng Canal, 15 kilometers long in Xining, Qinghai, have all been completed and released water after active repairs by the local garrison troops. The Shawan garrison spent one month repairing the Xinshang and Taiping canals, totaling more than 54,000 workdays (originally estimated at 80,000 workdays), using 800,000 catties of willow branches and 400,000 bricks, and excavating more than 133,000 cubic meters of earth (originally estimated at 145,000 cubic meters). When the troops began to build sluice gates and river dams, the accumulated snow had not completely melted. Commanders and fighters waded through the newly thawed, waist-deep Manas River, cutting willow branches and carrying bricks in snow more than a foot thick. A certain company completed the task of 30,000 catties of willow branches in six days with twenty people. In order not to miss the farming season and release water in time, all commanders and fighters launched a shock campaign. Many units lit gasoline lamps and burned firewood at night to rush work overnight. The mountain artillery company directly under a certain division created a record of an average of 19 cubic meters of earthwork per person per day. The two canals were officially released water on April 20th and 21st respectively. The two canals can irrigate a total of 120,000 mu of land. A certain regiment of the Qinghai Xining garrison used 7,061 workdays to repair the 15-kilometer-long Changsheng Canal in more than ten days, and newly built a 2-kilometer-long branch canal; a total of more than 17,000 cubic meters of earth was excavated, turning more than 10,000 mu of land in the suburbs of Xining into fertile fields. When the canal was released, the residents along the canal happily said: "In the past, the bandit Ma Bufang grabbed us to build canals for him, leaving our land barren; after the canal was dug, we could not get our turn to water the land. Now the People's Liberation Army is different. They are afraid that we will not be able to catch up with the season to water the land, so they worked so hard to dig and released the water early, and this year's production is possible."

　　新疆青海三渠完工
    十三万亩土地尽成良田
    【新华社兰州十八日电】新疆省北部沙湾县长三十公里的新盛渠、长二十公里的太平渠和青海西宁长十五公里的长胜渠，在当地驻军积极抢修下，都已完工放水。沙湾驻军以一个月时间，抢修新盛、太平两渠，共费工五万四千余个（原估计为八万个工），用了八十万斤柳条、四十万块砖，并起土十三万三千余公方（原估计为十四万五千公方）。部队开始修建水闸和拦河坝时，积雪尚未全消，指战员们涉过刚解冻的水深齐腰的马纳斯河，在尺余厚的雪地里砍柳条、背砖。某连二十个人在六天内完成了三万斤柳条任务。为了不误农时，及时放水，全体指战员展开了突击运动，很多单位在晚上点着汽灯，燃着柴火，连夜赶工。某师直属队山炮连，创造平均每人每天起土十九公方的最高纪录。两渠已先后于四月二十、二十一日两天中正式放水。两渠共可灌田十二万亩。青海西宁驻军某团，以七千零六十一个工在十余天内修补完毕十五公里长的长胜渠，并新修两公里长一条支渠；共起土一万七千余公方，使西宁城郊万余亩地变成良田。当该渠放水时，沿渠居民高兴地说：“过去马匪步芳抓咱们给他修渠，把咱们的地都叫荒着；渠挖好后，浇水就轮不上咱们了。如今解放军可不同了，怕咱们浇水赶不上季节，那样卖力的挖，提早放了水，今年的生产可有办法了。”
