　　Village Cadres Demolishing and Selling People's Houses – Hope Luan Nan County Government Will Investigate Promptly
    Hu Ge Zhuang in the fifth district of Luan Nan used to be a prosperous market town, but now it has become a sparsely populated, desolate village. This is partly due to war damage, but after liberation, it is also because some district and village cadres have become detached from the masses, corrupt and degenerate, coupled with the failure of leading cadres to conduct thorough and in-depth inspections of the work, causing the people to suffer great losses. It is hoped that the Special Commissioner's Office and the County Government will quickly investigate and correct this, so that the people's losses can be compensated.
    Village cadres, led by Yan Qing, Hao Peng, and Jin Shan, colluded and engaged in malpractices, seeking their own interests and disregarding the damage suffered by the masses, deceiving and threatening the masses. They bought houses, dismantled materials, and sold them to make production funds. When buying houses, they forced the sale and set the price arbitrarily. If the people refused to sell, they would threaten them with the label of landlord, saying, "If you don't sell, it will be confiscated. You are a landlord, and you can't keep it even if you don't sell." For example, the house of the Hao family, who used to run a distillery, the house of Yongfahao, and many other houses were demolished and sold by them. Now, on the streets, along with the broken bricks and tiles, are still piled up with roof beams and rafters.
    In many places, the destruction of the past is gradually being restored this year. Why can Hu Ge Zhuang be destroyed and acted recklessly at will? It is hoped that the leading organs will conduct thorough inspections and correct this as soon as possible!
    In addition, the substitute cultivation for military dependents is even worse. Because village cadres only care about their own interests, they simply do not care about the military dependents. They do not care about the quality of the substitute cultivation, and the people who do the substitute cultivation are even more careless. The military dependents do not seek them out. When the military dependents have no way to solve the problem, they sometimes go to the district, but the district also deals with it perfunctorily and pushes it back to the village. They simply do not check how things are done in the village.
    The materials from the houses demolished in Hu Ge Zhuang were all bought by villagers from other villages to build new houses, or they were taken away to burn as firewood. The masses in Hu Ge Zhuang are living in very difficult conditions due to the disaster. However, the lives of the village cadres are much better than before, and they are complacent in front of the masses. My opinion is that the Special Commissioner's Office and the County Government should conduct a detailed investigation and statistics to determine how many houses have been demolished under the village cadres' reckless behavior; how much property has been embezzled by the village cadres through forced purchases and demolition of the masses' houses, and demand that they compensate the masses for their losses, and the government should punish all village cadres who violate the laws of the People's Government.

    Editor's note: The situation that has occurred in Hu Ge Zhuang is a very serious matter. Please Tangshan Special Commissioner's Office immediately conduct an investigation and handle it, and inform this newspaper of the results.

### 村干部拆卖群众房屋望滦南县府及时调查

　　村干部拆卖群众房屋望滦南县府及时调查
    滦南五区胡各庄过去是一个很繁华的集镇，现在却成了个人烟绝少，荒凉破落的村庄了。这固然是因战争破坏了一部分，但是在解放后由于部分区村干部们脱离群众，贪污腐化，加上领导干部对工作不深入不检查，使人民遭受了极大的损失。希望专署、县府赶快检查纠正，使人民的损失得以补救。
    村干部以阎青、郝朋、靳杉等为首通同作弊，贪图自己利益不顾群众所受的损害，对群众欺骗威胁。他们用买房拆材料卖来作生产。买房屋硬买硬作价钱，如不卖则以地主帽子加上来威胁说：“不卖即没收。你是地主不卖也留不住的。”如原来开烧锅的郝家的一片房子，永发号的房子，还有其他许多房子都是他们拆着卖的。现在大街上和那些破砖烂瓦一起，还堆满房梁和椽子。
    在许多地方，过去的破坏今年也都在慢慢的恢复，为什么胡各庄可以随便破坏任意胡行呢？希望领导机关很好的深入检查，赶快纠正！
    另外对军属的代耕更是糟糕。因为村干们只图自己利益，根本就不把军属放在心上。代耕的好坏，他们是不过问的，代耕的人更是马虎，军属不找不去。军属没办法时，有时找到区上，区上也是应付了事，推到村中解决。他们根本也不检查村子里是怎样作的。
    胡各庄所拆的房子材料都叫外村买去建新房去了，要不就是拿去烧火。胡各庄的群众因为灾荒生活都很困难。可是村干部们的生活则比过去好得多，在群众面前得意洋洋。我的意见，请专署及县府详细调查统计一下，在村干部们这种胡作胡为的情形下拆了的房子有多少；村干部们强买强拆群众房子所贪污的财产有多少，要他们赔偿群众的损失，并由政府惩办所有违犯人民政府法律的村干部。

    编者按：胡各庄所发生的情况，是非常严重的事情。请唐山专署立即进行调查处理，并将结果告诉本报。
