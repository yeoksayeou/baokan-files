    Mayor: Nie Rongzhen

Provisional Regulations for Real Estate Ownership Registration in Urban Areas of Beijing

    Article 1: These regulations are formulated to determine public and private real estate rights in the urban areas of this city, complete land registration, and facilitate urban construction.

    Article 2: The following registration items shall be handled in accordance with these regulations, unless otherwise stipulated by central laws and regulations:

    1.  General Registration: All those who have not obtained a real estate ownership certificate from the Land Administration Bureau shall personally apply for registration (public property shall be handled by the management agency). However, those who have obtained a fake Land Administration Bureau certificate and whose real estate conditions and property rights have not changed may postpone registration.

    2.  Transfer Registration: In the case of transferring real estate due to sale, gift, exchange, or inheritance, both parties concerned shall jointly apply for registration. However, inheritance registration may be handled independently by the heir with proof.

    3.  Change Registration: In the case of newly built, rebuilt, demolished, divided, or merged real estate, the owner shall personally apply for registration. However, if it is necessary to consult with related parties, individual instructions may be given for handling.

    4.  Correction Registration: If the current real estate ownership certificate is inconsistent with the actual situation, the owner shall apply for registration.

    5.  Other Rights Registration: For the establishment of rights of superficies, mortgage rights, and land use rights (construction, passage), the rights holder and the obligor shall jointly apply for registration.

    6.  Cancellation Registration: When the registered other rights are extinguished, the original applicant rights holder and obligor shall jointly apply for registration.

    Article 3: Temples, ancestral halls, guild halls, private schools, companies, factories, shops, and other social organizations applying for real estate registration must hold registration certificates from the competent authorities, and the person in charge indicated on the certificate shall be the registration applicant.

    Article 4: If the registration applicant is not in this city, or although in this city, cannot personally apply for registration due to certain reasons, they must issue a power of attorney and have the local household registration authority (such as the public security station in the city or the district office in the countryside) or the service unit certify that the entrustment is true, and submit it to the agent for registration.

    Article 5: When applying for registration, relevant title deeds, name seals, stamps, household registration books or other identification documents must be brought. If it is an agent, the power of attorney of the client should also be brought. When necessary, the agent may be required to provide a guarantee from two reputable merchants.

    Article 6: The name of the registration applicant shall be based on the name recorded in the household registration book. Pseudonyms or aliases shall not be used. Those who have previously used pseudonyms, aliases, or hall names to purchase property should submit reliable documents and apply for correction at the time of registration.

    Article 7: If the real estate is jointly owned by multiple people, all co-owners should jointly apply, and one person should be designated to hold the certificate, and other co-owners should each hold a co-owner's license.

    Article 8: After applying for registration, the following procedures shall be followed:

    1.  Preliminary Examination: The registration applicant shall submit all documents to the preliminary examiner to fill out the application form on their behalf. After review, the documents shall be transferred to the receiving personnel. Any missing procedures during the preliminary examination shall be completed during the re-examination.

    2.  Receipt: After receiving the application form, the receiving personnel shall stamp the upper end of the title deed with the receiving stamp. If it is necessary to verify the account, a verification notice shall be issued (or notified separately), the title deed shall be returned on the spot, and the owner's name seal shall be affixed.

    3.  Public Announcement: All registrations, except for other rights and cancellation registrations, shall be publicly announced for one month. The public announcement shall be made by posting it in front of the Land Administration Bureau and publishing it in the People's Daily for one day, so that interested parties can submit written objections to the Land Administration Bureau during the announcement period. If no objection is raised after the announcement period expires, the applicant shall come to the bureau within fifteen days after the announcement period to handle the re-examination, payment, and certificate collection procedures.

    4.  Account Verification: For all registrations other than cancellation registration, if it is deemed necessary to verify the account, the applicant shall arrange with the relevant parties to go to the site for survey and identification according to the time specified in the account verification notice.

    5.  Re-examination: After the announcement period expires, the applicant shall submit all documents to the re-examination personnel for re-examination. If the examination is consistent, permission will be granted to pay the fee.

    6.  Fee Collection: If the re-examination is consistent, the registration fee shall be paid in accordance with the regulations and a receipt shall be issued.

    7.  Certificate Issuance: The ownership certificate or other rights license shall be collected with the title deed, registration fee receipt, and name seal. The old certificate shall be taken back and canceled by the certificate issuer. The original title deed shall be canceled and returned.

    Article 9: Real estate registration fees shall be collected according to the following standards:

    1.  General registration, transfer registration, and registration of lost certificates shall be charged a registration fee of four per thousand of the total assessed price of the real estate.

    2.  Other rights registration shall be charged a registration fee of four per thousand of the value of the right.

    3.  For those who have obtained a map certificate issued by the Land Administration Bureau and apply for change registration and correction registration, a registration fee of one per thousand of the total assessed price of the real estate shall be charged.

    4.  Cancellation registration is exempt from registration fees.

    Article 10: Transfer registration, change registration, and other rights registration shall be applied for within one month from the date of establishment or completion of the change of the contract. For the parts of the general registration that have already been carried out, the original deadline of January 31, 1950, shall still apply. Those who apply for other registrations without general registration shall simultaneously complete or expedite the general registration.

    Article 11: Those who register overdue shall be fined an amount ranging from 5% to 200% of the registration fee, depending on the number of days overdue.

    Article 12: If the house number of the real estate changes, the owner shall apply for a change of certificate without charge.

    Article 13: Real estate for which ownership registration has not been applied for shall not be registered for other rights.

    Article 14: If the real estate title deed is lost and registration is applied for, if it is found that there is a record to check, a notice must be published in the People's Daily for three days, stating that the original title deed is invalid, and proof from the local public security station where the real estate is located, and a guarantee from two or more neighboring owners or two reputable merchants must be obtained. After investigation and confirmation, a replacement may be issued.

    Article 15: If a registration applicant obtains registration by fraudulent or forged documents, after being discovered, in addition to confiscating the fees already paid and revoking the registration, the applicant shall be handed over to the judicial authorities for punishment.

    Article 16: Separate measures shall be formulated for the registration of foreign public and private real estate.
