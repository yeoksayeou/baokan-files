　　Strict System and Ample Equipment
　　Jingxing Mine Improves Security Work
[Report from this newspaper in Jingxing] In order to ensure the completion of the 1950 production tasks and implement the principle of "Safety First," the state-owned Jingxing Coal Mine conducted a spring safety inspection, and security work has been considerably improved. According to statistics from the spring season's two and a half months, the mine experienced a total of 190 accidents, including coal roof collapses, vehicle collisions, and support damage, resulting in 261 worker injuries and deaths (1 death, 15 serious injuries, and 245 minor injuries). The main reasons for the accidents were the simple pursuit of production efficiency, lack of long-term planning, and neglect of safety equipment. The mine's underground ventilation was poor (in the new mine, the underground ventilation only reached 1.4 to 1.8 cubic feet per person per minute). Many beams were not long enough, broken beams were not replaced in a timely manner, cracks appeared in coal mining roadways, and many support frames were damaged in the recovery tunnels. Those in charge had long ignored these phenomena. Furthermore, they did not pay attention to safety education for workers, leading to continuous accidents.

After the major safety work inspection, the mine's safety work has been improved as follows: (1) Enhancing ventilation equipment. The underground exhaust fan speed has been increased by 10 revolutions, and a 20-horsepower exhaust fan has been added to the Nanxiaokeng, increasing the average air volume per person per minute to 2.3 cubic feet, meeting specifications. (2) Replenishing safety equipment such as safety lamps, electric headlights, water detection drills, ventilation fans, and water sprayers. Establishing methane detectors, safety lamp inspectors, oxygen respirators, automatic respirators, and waterproof gate drainage equipment. (3) Strengthening safety education, having already held two to four safety training classes, with more than 140 participants. Distributing "Safety Instructions" booklets and lamp/fire inspection forms, mobilizing all workers to study safety, so that everyone has common knowledge and everyone has responsibility. (4) Establishing organizational structures, forming a "Safety Committee" with worker participation, holding regular safety meetings to review the advantages and disadvantages of the unit's safety work. Stipulating safety systems for mechanical and electrical equipment, as well as underground operations. Establishing a daily hierarchical reporting system for safety work in order to grasp safety conditions and deal with problems in a timely manner. At the same time, a strict reward and punishment system has been established.

　　严格制度·充实设备
　　井陉矿改进保安工作
    【本报井陉讯】国营井陉煤矿为保证完成一九五○年生产任务，贯彻“保安第一”的方针，曾经进行了春季保安大检查，保安工作已有相当改进。据春季两个半月统计，该矿共发生煤顶塌落、碰车及支柱损坏等事故一百九十次，伤亡工人二百六十一人（死亡一人，重伤十五人，轻伤二百四十五人）。肇祸成灾的主要原因，是单纯追求生产效率，没有长远打算，忽视安全设备。该矿井下通风不良（新井矿井下每人每分钟只达一·四至一·八立方尺）。许多梁木长度不够，折断梁木亦未及时更换，采煤巷道发生裂隙，回采洞内坏棚很多。对于这些现象，负责方面长期熟视无睹。对工人又不注意保安教育，致事故不断发生。
    经过保安工作大检查，该矿保安工作已作如下改进：（一）增强通风设备。井下抽风机增加了十转度，南小坑增设二十马力抽风机，使每人每分钟平均风量增到二·三立方尺，已达规格化。（二）充实安全灯、电头灯、探水钻、扇风机、喷水器等保安器材。建立沼气检查器、安全灯检查器、氧气呼吸器、自动呼吸器及防水闸门排水设备等。（三）加强保安教育，已举办二至四次保安训练班，参加者一百四十余人。印发“保安须知”小册子及验灯验火表，发动全体工人的保安学习，以便作到人人有常识，人人有责任。（四）确立组织机构，成立有工人参加的“保安委员会”，定期召开保安会议，检讨本单位保安工作的优缺点。规定了机电及坑下等保安制度。建立了保安工作每日逐级汇报制，以便掌握保安情况，及时处理问题。同时，并建立了严格奖惩制度。
