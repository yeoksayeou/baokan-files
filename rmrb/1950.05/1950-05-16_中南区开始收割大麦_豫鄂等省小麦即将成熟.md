　　Central South Region Begins Harvesting Barley
　　Wheat in Henan, Hubei and Other Provinces Nearing Maturity
    [Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 14th] Barley harvesting has begun in various parts of the Central South Region, and wheat is nearing maturity. Farmers everywhere are now working intensively on threshing grounds and adding farm tools and other preparations for the wheat harvest. In the warmer provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Hubei, barley harvesting has begun, and in some areas it has already been completed. In Henan, Jiangxi, Hebei, and other provinces, wheat has flowered and formed ears, and is about to be harvested. This spring, rainfall in the Central South Region has been even, and barley and wheat have grown very well. For example, in Xiaogan Prefecture, Hubei Province, each dou of land (two and a half dou of land equals one Chinese mu) can yield an average of three dou of barley (the highest yield in good years was four dou). Wheat yields in Baofeng County, Henan Province, and other areas are expected to be 10% to 20% higher than last year. The broad masses of farmers are overjoyed by this year's bumper wheat harvest.
    In order to ensure the success of the wheat harvest, the Hankou Changjiang Daily published a commentary entitled "Welcome and Protect the Wheat Harvest," calling on leading organs and rural workers in the Central South Region to fully mobilize farmers to prepare for the wheat harvest. Once the wheat harvest begins, they should seize the opportunity and mobilize and organize all farmers to rush the harvest, in order to prevent losses due to over-ripening. At the same time, it is also necessary to organize the guarding and protection of the wheat, and the defense of the wheat harvest, to prevent and suppress the Kuomintang secret agents, bandits, local bullies, and landlords who are hiding and carrying out theft, robbery, and other activities to sabotage the wheat harvest. The commentary also called on local organs and troops to allocate a large number of manpower and livestock to help farmers harvest wheat. Local farm tool factories, blacksmith shops, carpentry shops, and trade organs and rural cooperatives should also systematically supply farmers with the farm tools needed for the wheat harvest.

　　中南区开始收割大麦
　　豫鄂等省小麦即将成熟
    【新华社汉口十四日电】中南区各地大麦已开始收割，小麦即将成熟，各地农民现正紧张地进行碾场和添置农具等麦收准备工作。气候较暖的广东、广西、江西、湖北四省已开始收割大麦，有些地区业已收割完毕。河南、江西、河北等省小麦已扬花结穗，即将收割。今春中南各地雨水调匀，大麦、小麦都生长得极好。如湖北孝感专区各县，大麦平均每斗田（二斗半田合一市亩）可收三斗（丰收年最高时曾收过四斗）。河南宝丰等县小麦可比去年多收一成至二成。广大农民都为今年麦子的丰收而欢欣鼓舞。
    为了保证做好麦收工作，汉口长江日报以《迎接和保卫麦收》为题发表评论，号召中南各地领导机关和农村工作人员全力动员农民作好麦收准备工作，麦收开始后即应抓紧时机，动员组织全体农民进行赶收，以防因麦子过熟而遭受损失。同时还须组织看麦、护麦和保卫麦收，防止和镇压潜藏的国民党特务、土匪、恶霸地主等偷窃、抢劫和其他破坏麦收的活动。评论还要求各地机关、部队应抽出大批人力、畜力，帮助农民收麦。各地农具厂、铁匠炉、木匠铺和贸易机关、农村合作社，亦应有计划地供应农民以麦收所需的农具。
