Northeast Workers Fight for the Industrialization of New China
	Zhang Weizhen, Chairman of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions

	The Northeast occupies a particularly important position in China's national economy. According to the statistics of 1943, the Northeast's coal production accounted for 49% of the country's total, pig iron for 87%, steel for 93%, electricity for 78%, and railways for 42%. In some sectors of heavy industry, the Northeast's figures were overwhelmingly dominant. Due to the important position of the Northeast in China's economic construction, before the People's Liberation Army drove Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, supported by American imperialism, from this land, Chairman Mao Zedong and the Central Committee of the Communist Party specially instructed us to work hard to restore and develop the economy of the Northeast, especially its industry, and to build the Northeast into a base for the industrialization of the whole country. The instructions of Chairman Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee represented the wishes of the people of the whole country. The people of the Northeast, especially the working class of the Northeast, should and must bravely and firmly shoulder this glorious task.

	The Northeast's industry, built with the blood and sweat of the Chinese working people, was once quite considerable in scale. However, when Japanese imperialism was defeated by the Soviet Red Army and the Chinese people, they carried out a desperate destruction. Then, the Kuomintang bandits, with the help of American imperialism, came to plunder the people of the Northeast. Before they were annihilated by the People's Liberation Army, the bandits carried out devastating destruction of the Northeast's economy. The enemy was defeated, but in the newly liberated area, almost all the industrial equipment was damaged and incomplete. There was not a single complete bridge on the railway lines, the coal mines were filled with water, there was a lack of electricity, and many factory buildings were incomplete. For example, Anshan, which once had 170,000 workers, had only a few thousand left watching the factories after the rest had either starved and fled or been captured. The production of steel and iron had almost come to a standstill, and the destruction of light industry was also very serious, with the paper industry almost needing to be rebuilt. This was the dilapidated property we seized from the hands of imperialism and domestic reactionaries.

	It was on these ruins that the workers and people of the Northeast, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, restored the industry of the Northeast. The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and the Northeast People's Government proposed to strive to reach the level of industrial equipment and agricultural production of 1943 by 1952, and to transform the colonial economy into a people's economy. Of course, the difficulties facing us were serious, but the awakened Northeast workers bravely took on this burden and advanced with a series of heroic actions.

	The history of the workers' movement in the Northeast for more than a year after the liberation of the entire Northeast is written like this: Before the enemy's army was defeated, advanced workers had already secretly protected machines and equipment in various ways. After the enemy was defeated, scattered soldiers, secret agents, and hooligans took the opportunity to carry out large-scale activities and destroy factories. Workers in various places immediately publicly established factory protection teams to protect the people's factories and mines. The Anshan worker protection team of 1,200 people rescued 1,800 railcars of machinery at the risk of their lives under enemy fire. The members of the factory protection team carried out a resolute struggle against the saboteurs. In the restoration of production, factories lacked equipment, and some equipment was simply impossible to buy for a while. For this reason, workers immediately launched a campaign to contribute and collect equipment. During the campaign, workers searched for usable materials from scrap iron piles, which they called "scrap iron's turn to stand up." Many workers donated valuable machines and equipment that they had stolen from factories and mines managed by the enemy in the past, and even the tools they were used to using, to the factories. They said that the factory was now their own home, and these things should be put in places where they could be more efficient. According to incomplete statistics, Fushun workers donated more than 240,000 pieces, and Anshan donated more than 210,000 pieces. These materials played a considerable role in resuming production and overcoming material difficulties.

	Then, in order to welcome the first "May Day" Labor Day after the liberation of the entire Northeast, the vast majority of workers in the Northeast were involved in a competition craze. This movement further raised the consciousness of the workers, fundamentally changed the past attitude of loafing on the job, and the workers understood how to treat their own factories with the attitude of masters, how to cherish tools, save raw materials, and improve the quality and quantity of products. In July and August of last year, a mass anti-waste struggle was launched. The workers boldly criticized the waste phenomenon in our enterprises and the phenomenon of causing national losses due to poor management. This further promoted the operation and management of enterprises.

	It was on this basis that Zhao Guoyou, a lathe worker, and Zhang Shangju, a marker worker, of the Shenyang No. 3 Machine Tool Factory created new records of increasing labor efficiency by 3.2 times and 6.2 times in September last year. Because the conditions of the masses were so mature, these pioneering actions were immediately enthusiastically responded to by the vast number of employees once they were promoted by the Party, the government, and the trade union. Now the movement to create new records has become an unprecedentedly widespread mass production movement. According to the statistics of the factories and mines under the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government for the first four months of this year, nearly 20,000 new records have emerged, and more than 50,000 advanced producers have made labor productivity generally increase by 32.82%. This movement has actually changed the face of our factories and mines, educated cadres, and at the same time transformed the working class itself.

	Last year's production plan was completed ahead of schedule in the railway sector, and the factories and mines under the Industrial Department also completed the plan, exceeding it by 4.2%. The production plan for the first quarter of this year has been completed and exceeded for major products. It should be pointed out that the speed of industrial recovery is very fast. Taking the factories and mines under the Industrial Department as an example, very few factories were started when they were first taken over. Now, except for individual factories and mines that are difficult to start due to too much damage, the general factories and mines that have been taken over have been started. What is particularly worth pointing out is the speed at which our industrial production has recovered. For example, the ironmaking equipment has only recovered 25% of the highest level during the puppet Manchukuo era, while the output has reached 42.2% of the highest output during the puppet Manchukuo era. The number of spindles has only recovered to 66% of the highest level during the puppet Manchukuo era, while the output has reached 143% of the highest output during the puppet Manchukuo era. This is a clear proof that the labor enthusiasm and wisdom of workers in people's enterprises have been fully developed. This also fully illustrates the superior nature of our New Democratic public industry and shows the great prospect of rapid development of productive forces.

	Adapting to the recovery of production and the development of industry, the people's government has also made considerable improvements in the material and cultural life of the working people. In the past year, the number of employed people increased by 240,000 in state-owned enterprises alone, and more than 200,000 workers will be absorbed from cities, rural areas, and inside the passes this year to participate in industrial construction. Although the war has not ended and the country still has serious financial difficulties, the actual wages of employees and workers have been increased twice. In May last year, the average was 110 points, and by the end of December, it increased to 140 points, an average increase of 27%. Recently, the wages of technicians have been raised to a maximum of 1100 points, and the wages of workers are also being adjusted. After the adjustment, the average wage will actually be about 8% higher than at the end of last year. In particular, thanks to the efforts of the people's government, prices in the Northeast have remained stable, which is a major guarantee for the material life of the working people.

	Since February last year, the government has implemented labor insurance in all state-owned enterprises in the Northeast, with the state paying labor insurance premiums equivalent to 3% of wages. According to the provisions of labor insurance, the trade union has established six sanatoriums, and began to establish night sanatoriums, a nursing home, and five disability homes in large factories to provide necessary relief and assistance to employees who are giving birth, sick, injured, disabled, or old. In addition, the state pays 4.5% (light industry) to 6.5% (heavy industry) of the total wage each month for employees' medical expenses and other welfare expenses. This has provided a considerable guarantee for the material life of workers, which has greatly enhanced workers' sense of ownership and enthusiasm for production. The technical conservatism of "teach the apprentice, starve the master" that has traditionally existed among workers has begun to be dispelled. Workers said: "In the past, I was afraid that I would be old and the factory would not want me, so I was unwilling to teach the apprentice technology. Now that there is labor insurance, what are you afraid of?" Traineeship competitions have automatically started in railways and some other factories. These are things that have never happened before.

	Due to the improvement of workers' material lives, workers are more eager to improve their culture. To this end, the government has allocated funds equivalent to 1.5% of the total wages as workers' after-work cultural education funds.

	Imperialism and feudal bureaucratic capital used to consolidate their rule by keeping the people ignorant. Therefore, 60% of the workers are illiterate. This situation seriously affects our country's construction cause. Therefore, how to eliminate illiteracy and improve the cultural and technical level of workers is one of the important tasks facing workers. In order to solve this serious problem, in the past year (1949), the trade union organized 3,624 after-work cultural schools (missing statistics from one province and four industrial trade unions of the electricity, post and telecommunications, forestry and textile industries), with more than 3,000 teachers regularly helping more than 200,000 employees to study culture. But there is still a shortage of teachers, and some places still have to adopt the "little teacher system" (those with higher culture help those with lower culture). In addition, because there are not enough classrooms, workers have to use clubs, open spaces, dormitories, canteens and workshops for learning. The coal mine trade union has set up pithead schools at the pitheads. These difficult conditions have not affected the workers' enthusiasm for learning. Although Chinese characters are so difficult for beginners, an illiterate worker can learn an average of 700 to 800 characters after a year of study. Liu Meilan, a female worker in Dalian, learned 2,000 characters in a year and now serves as the secretary of the Youth League branch and can write work summary reports.

	In terms of technical learning, especially in the new record movement, a craze for learning technology has emerged among workers. According to the statistics of the Railway Trade Union and the Lüda Trade Union alone, there are 528 after-work technical schools with about 16,000 workers studying. In this regard, Northeast workers will always remember the valuable help given by Soviet experts.

	The Party and the trade union have always attached importance to political education among workers. In addition to some regular political training courses, every commemorative festival has become a good opportunity for the Party and the trade union to conduct political education. Last year's "May Day" Labor Day, the founding of the People's Republic of China, the October Revolution Day, the Asian-Australian Trade Union Conference, and the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance this year have all become festivals of revelry for the Chinese working class. The Railway General Trade Union and the Lüda General Trade Union have held "Sino-Soviet Friendship Month." Trade unions in various places have actively participated in the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association has established daily work and activities among workers. These activities have repeatedly proved the unshakable brotherly friendship between the two great nations of China and the Soviet Union. Northeast workers, like workers across the country, are following the construction and workers' activities in the Soviet Union and new democratic countries with great interest. The Soviet people's internationalist friendship and selfless help to the Chinese people have moved every Northeast worker and become our example. The happy life and construction examples of the Soviet people encourage us to bravely move forward towards the road of Lenin and Stalin. The workers also care about the revolutionary struggle of the working class in capitalist countries and colonial countries. Workers also care about every victory in their struggle as their own victory.

	The trade union has become a powerful organization of employees. Under the leadership of the Northeast Federation of Trade Unions, there are eight industrial trade unions, six provincial trade unions, four municipal trade unions, and two regional trade unions. The establishment of mechanical, chemical, seafarer, and porter trade unions is being prepared. These organizations unite 1.5 million workers around them, constantly educate the masses in the spirit of New Democracy and Communism, organize mass production movements, and guide employees to learn science, learn technology, and learn management. The number of worker cadres transferred to enterprise administration through the trade union is very large. At present, almost all grassroots cadres in state-owned factories and mines are promoted by workers. Employee representatives often account for the largest proportion in the people's congresses at all levels. Famous labor heroes such as Liu Yingyuan have been elected as members of the Northeast People's Government.

	Many of our work aspects are just beginning, and there are still many difficulties ahead, but as long as we remember Chairman Mao Zedong's words: consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, unite international friends, our difficulties can and will be overcome.

　　为新中国工业化而斗争的东北工人
    东北总工会主席  张维桢
    东北在中国国民经济中占着特殊重要的地位，按照一九四三年的统计，东北煤的生产量占全国的百分之四十九，生铁占全国百分之八十七，钢材占全国百分之九十三，电力占全国百分之七十八，铁路占全国百分之四十二。重工业的若干部门，东北方面的数字是压倒的。由于东北在中国经济建设上所处的重要地位，所以在人民解放军把美帝国主义支持下的蒋介石匪徒从这块地面上赶走之前，毛泽东主席和共产党中央，就特别指示我们，要我们好好努力，全力恢复和发展东北的经济，特别是工业，把东北建设为全国工业化的基地。毛泽东主席和党中央的指示，代表着全国人民的意愿，东北人民，首先是东北的工人阶级应该而且必须勇敢而坚定地负起这个光荣的任务。
    用中国劳动人民血汗建设起来的东北工业，其规模曾经是颇为可观的，但是，在日本帝国主义被苏联红军和中国人民击溃的时候，他们施行了一次绝望的破坏，接着国民党匪帮，在美帝国主义帮助下，又来掠夺东北人民，在他们被人民解放军歼灭之前，匪徒们又对东北经济施行了毁灭性的破坏。敌人是被打倒了，但是在新解放的地区，几乎所有的工业设备被毁坏的残缺不全，铁路线上没有一座完整的桥梁，煤矿中积满了水，电力缺乏，许多厂房都不完整，像曾经达到过十七万工人的鞍山，但除了饿跑和捉走的只剩下几千工人在看着工厂。钢与铁的生产几乎停顿下来，轻工业破坏的也很严重，像造纸工业差不多是要重建。这就是我们从帝国主义与国内反动派手里夺回来的破坏不堪的财产。
    就是在这废墟上，东北工人和东北人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，恢复东北的工业。中共中央东北局与东北人民政府提出争取在一九五二年，使工业设备与农业的生产量达到一九四三年的水平，并把殖民地的经济改造成人民的经济。诚然，摆在我们面前的困难是严重的，但觉悟的东北工人勇敢地挑起这一重担，他们用一连串的英雄式的行动前进着。
    全东北解放后一年多工人运动的历史是这样写的：在敌人的军队溃败之前，先进的工人即已以各种方式秘密地保护机器与各种设备，当敌人溃败之后，散兵，特务，流氓又乘机大肆活动，破坏工厂，各地工人立即公开地成立了护厂队，保护人民的工厂和矿山，鞍山一、二○○人的工人护厂队，在敌人炮火下冒着生命的危险，抢救了一、八○○车箱的机器。护厂队员与破坏分子进行了坚决的斗争，在恢复生产中，工厂缺乏器材，有些器材简直是一时无法买到的。为此工人立即展开献交器材和搜集器材的运动。在运动中，工人从废铁堆中找寻可用的材料，他们叫做“废铁翻身”。许多工人把过去从敌人管理的厂矿中偷出的贵重机器和器材，甚至自己用惯了的工具也捐献给工厂，他们说，现在工厂就是自己的家了，这些东西应该放到更能发挥它们效率的地方去。仅据不完全的统计，抚顺工人就捐献出二十四万余件，鞍山为二十一万余件。这些器材对复工生产与克服材料困难上起了相当的作用。
    接着为了迎接全东北解放后第一个“五一”劳动节，全东北的工人绝大多数卷入竞赛热潮。在这运动中进一步提高了工人的觉悟程度，根本改变了过去磨洋工的态度，工人懂得了如何用主人翁的态度对待自己的工厂，怎样爱护工具，节省原料，提高产品的质量与数量。在去年七、八月间掀起了一个群众性的反浪费斗争。工人们大胆地批评了我们企业中的浪费现象，和由于不善经营而造成国家损失的现象。这对于企业的经营与管理工作有了进一步的推动。
    就在这样的基础上，去年九月沈阳机器三厂的车床工人赵国有与划线工张尚举创造了劳动效率提高三·二倍和六·二倍的新纪录。由于群众的条件已经这样成熟，这些首创行动一经党、政府与工会的提倡，立即为广大职工所热烈响应，现在创造新纪录运动已成为空前广泛的群众生产运动。根据东北人民政府工业部所属厂矿今年一月前四个月的统计，出现了将近二万件的新纪录，先进生产者达五万余人，使劳动生产率普遍提高了百分之三二·八二。这个运动实际上改变了我们厂矿的面貌，教育了干部，同时也改造了工人阶级自己。
    去年的生产计划，在铁路方面是提前完成了，在工业部所属厂矿也完成了计划，并超过了百分之四·二。今年第一季度的生产计划主要产品业已完成并有超过。应该指出，工业恢复的速度是很快的，仅就工业部所属厂矿而言，初接收时，开工的工厂是很少的，现在除个别厂矿因破坏太严重，尚难开工者外，所接收的一般的厂矿均已开工，特别值得指出的是我们工业生产量恢复的速度。比如炼铁设备只恢复了伪满时代最高水平的百分之二十五，而产量则达到伪满最高产量的百分之四二·二。纱锭设备只恢复到伪满最高水平的百分之六十六，而产量则达到伪满时代最高产量的百分之一百四十三。这是在人民企业中，工人的劳动积极性与智慧，得到充分发展的明证，这也完全说明了我们新民主主义公营工业的优越性质，表明了生产力可能迅速发展的伟大前途。
    适应着生产的恢复和工业的发展，人民政府对劳动人民的物质与文化生活也作了相当的改善。去年一年就业人数仅公营企业增加了二十四万人，今年又将从城市、农村和关内吸收二十余万工人参加工业建设。虽然战争还未结束，国家在财政上还有严重的困难，但职员与工人的实际工资已两度提高，在去年五月平均为一一○分，到十二月底即增加到一四○分，平均提高百分之二十七，最近，技术人员的工资最高提到一一○○分，工人的工资亦正在着手调整中，调整后平均工资，实际上将比去年年底提高百分之八左右。特别由于人民政府的努力，东北的物价保持平稳，这对劳动人民的物质生活是重大的保障。
    政府从去年二月在全东北公营企业中实行了劳动保险，由国家支付相当于工资百分之三的劳动保险金。按照劳动保险的规定，工会办理了六个休养所，在大工厂中开始创办夜间疗养所，一个养老院，五个残废院，对生育、患病与伤残衰老职工实行必要的救济与帮助。此外，国家每月支付相当于工资总额百分之四·五（轻工业）至百分之六·五（重工业）为职工的医药费和其他的福利费。使工人的物质生活得到了相当的保障，这就大大提高了工人的主人翁感，与生产积极性。在工人中传统存在的“教会徒弟，饿死师父”的技术保守思想，开始打消了，工人说：“过去怕自己老了，工厂不要了，所以不愿把技术教给徒弟，现在有了劳动保险，还怕什么？”在铁路和其他一些工厂里都自动开始了带徒弟竞赛。这都是从来未有过的事情。
    由于工人物质生活的改善，工人更渴望文化的提高。为此，政府拨出相当于工资总额百分之一·五的经费作为工人业余的文化教育经费。
    帝国主义与封建官僚资本是用愚昧人民来巩固其统治的。因此在工人中有百分之六十是文盲。这种情况严重地影响着我们国家的建设事业。因此，如何消灭文盲，提高工人的文化、技术水平，乃是摆在工人面前的重要任务之一。为了解决这一严重问题，去年（一九四九年）一年，工会即组织了三千六百二十四所业余文化学校（内缺一个省和电业、邮电、林业和纺织四个产业总工会的统计），经常有三千多位教员，帮助着二十万以上职工学习文化。但仍感教员不足，有些地方还要采用“小先生制”（文化较高的帮助文化较低的）。此外，因为教室不足，工人不得不利用俱乐部、露天地、宿舍、食堂和车间进行学习，煤矿工会在坑口办起坑口学校。这些困难条件并未影响工人的学习热情。虽然中国文字对初学者是那样困难，一个文盲工人经过一年学习平均能学会七、八百个字，大连一位女工刘梅兰一年学会了两千字，现在担任青年团的支部书记，并能写工作总结报告。
    在技术学习方面，特别在新纪录运动中，工人中出现了学习技术的热潮，仅铁路工会和旅大工会的统计已有五二八所业余技术学校，约一万六千工人在学习。在这方面东北工人永远记着苏联专家给予的可贵的帮助。
    关于工人中的政治教育是党与工会历来重视的工作。除去一些正规的政治训练班外，每一个纪念节日都成为党与工会进行政治教育的良好机会。去年“五一”劳动节，中华人民共和国成立，十月革命节，亚澳工会会议，和今年中苏缔结友好同盟等，都成为中国工人阶级狂欢的节日。铁路总工会与旅大总工会曾举行过“中苏友谊月”各地工人都最积极的参加了中苏友好协会，中苏友好协会在工人中并建立了日常的工作与活动。这些活动一再证明着中苏两大民族不可动摇的兄弟友谊。东北工人正和全国工人一样以极大的兴趣关心着苏联与新民主主义国家的建设与工人的活动，苏联人民的国际主义友情和对中国人民无私的帮助，感动着每个东北工人，并成为我们的榜样。苏联人民的幸福生活和建设的榜样鼓舞着我们向着列宁，斯大林的道路勇敢前进。对资本主义国家与殖民地国家工人阶级的革命斗争。对他们斗争的每一个胜利工人们也如同自己的胜利一样地关怀着。
    工会业已成为职工自己的强大组织。在东北总工会领导下，有八个产业总工会，六个省总工会，四个市总工会和两个地区总工会。正准备建立机械、化学、海员、搬运总工会。这些组织将一五○万工人团结在自己的周围。经常以新民主主义与共产主义的精神教育群众，组织群众性的生产运动，引导职工学习科学，学习技术，学习管理。经过工会输送给企业行政方面的工人干部数量是很大的。目前各公营厂矿中的基层干部几乎完全是由工人提拔起来的。在各级人民代表会中职工代表经常占着最大的比例，著名的劳动英雄如刘英源等被推为东北人民政府的委员。
    我们许多工作方在开始，摆在面前的困难还很多，但是只要我们记住毛泽东主席的话：巩固人民民主专政，团结国际友人，我们的困难是可以而且一定能战胜的。（按：此稿为英文半月刊《人民中国》而作）
