Xinhua News Agency, 13th dispatch: The French people are protesting with immense anger against Schuman’s proposal regarding the so-called joint French-German management of coal and iron resources, denouncing it as a "terrible and shameless betrayal of France" (Agence Telegraphique).

According to a TASS dispatch on the 11th: The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor has issued a communiqué in response, severely criticizing Schuman's proposal. The communiqué points out: If this proposal is implemented, the abandonment of national independence will reach a greater degree, the number of unemployed will continue to increase, and the situation of workers will further deteriorate. The communiqué also stated that this plan confirms the increasingly intensified policy of preparing for an anti-Soviet war of aggression.

Also according to a TASS dispatch on the 10th: The French Communist Party organ, L'Humanité, in an editorial discussing Schuman's proposal, angrily pointed out: "France has been sold out for the purposes of war." "Schuman's proposal is a shameless betrayal of France, a betrayal of its independence and freedom, which means practically abandoning national sovereignty, and France will become merely an appendage of the Marshallized Ruhr—an appendage of the American colony. Betrayal has become the tradition of the exploiting classes." L'Humanité called on all loyal patriots to close ranks and fight for peace and the national independence of France.

　　法人民抗议舒曼卖国
　　反对法与西德联营煤铁资源建议
    人道报号召争取和平与民族独立
    【新华社十三日讯】法国人民以无比的愤怒抗议舒曼关于所谓法德联合经营煤铁资源的建议，斥之为“对于法国可怕而无耻的出卖”（电通社）。
    据塔斯社十一日消息：法国总工会执行局已为此发表公报，严辞斥责舒曼的建议。公报指出：如这一建议得以实行，国家独立的放弃将达到更大的程度，失业人口将继续增加，工人境遇将更趋恶化。公报又称，这一计划证实了筹备反苏侵略战争的政策日益加紧。
    又据塔斯社十日报道：法国共产党机关报《人道报》在社论中论及舒曼的建议时，愤怒地指出：“法国已为战争的目的而被出卖。”“舒曼的建议是对法国无耻的背叛，对它的独立与自由的背叛，这意味着在实际上放弃国家的主权，法国将变成只是马歇尔化鲁尔的附属物——美国殖民地的附属物。背叛已成为剥削阶级的传统了”。人道报号召一切忠诚的爱国者紧密其队伍，为和平与法国民族的独立而斗争。
