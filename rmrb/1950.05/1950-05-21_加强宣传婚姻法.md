Strengthen Publicity of the Marriage Law
Editor Comrades:
　　On April 27th, I went to Liang Village in Lincheng County, Hebei Province, and talked with the village head about the public's reaction after the promulgation of the Marriage Law. The village head said at the time: "The district doesn't pass on any information about anything, and the village head doesn't even know about the Marriage Law." How can the broad masses of the people understand it this way? I hope that governments at all levels will strengthen the publicity and education work on the Marriage Law so that the Marriage Law can be effectively implemented among the broad masses.

　　加强宣传婚姻法编者同志：
    四月廿七日我到河北临城县梁村与该村村长谈起婚姻法公布后群众有什么反映，当时村长说：区里有什么事情也不给传达，村长对婚姻法还不知道。这样广大人民怎样能了解呢？希望各地政府加强对婚姻法的宣传教育工作，使婚姻法在广大群众中能切实执行。
