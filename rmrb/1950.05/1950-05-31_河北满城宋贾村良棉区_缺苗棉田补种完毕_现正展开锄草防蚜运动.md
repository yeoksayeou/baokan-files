　　Liangmian Area in Songjia Village, Mancheng, Hebei
    Completes Reseeding of Cotton Fields with Missing Seedlings
    Now Launching a Weeding and Aphid Prevention Campaign
    [Report from Mancheng, by this newspaper] In order to ensure the planting and harvest of the No. 2 Si cotton strain, Songjia and five other villages in Mancheng County, Hebei Province, have been carrying out a seedling inspection and replanting campaign since the 9th of this month. By the 12th of this month, the replanting of 440 mu of cotton fields lacking seedlings had been basically completed, ensuring full seedlings for all 3,100 mu of cotton. In these six villages, 2,300 mu of cotton fields had soil surfaces compacted by heavy rains. After the rain stopped, the masses were mobilized to rush to loosen the soil, which was completed in four days. Only 440 mu of cotton fields had uneven seedling emergence. In order to ensure the purity of the improved variety and prevent the planting of mixed varieties or other crops, labor model Song Luoxue borrowed 130 jin of cotton seeds from the cotton production guidance area on the 7th of this month. That evening, he convened a meeting of all cadres in Songjia Village, pointing out the importance of maintaining pure varieties and calling on the masses to replant only No. 2 Si cotton. The next day, all cadres conducted door-to-door propaganda and mobilization by district. After two or three days of seedling inspection and seed soaking, replanting was generally carried out on the 10th. Cotton fields where the cotton buds were dried out (because of shallow planting after the rain) and could not emerge were replanted with No. 2 Si cotton. Only about ten mu of land in the entire village were destroyed and replanted. Out of the 900 mu of cotton fields in Songjia Village, only 120 mu had 80% seedling emergence; the cotton buds emerged very well in other cotton fields. With the active replanting by the masses, the replanting of cotton fields with missing seedlings was basically completed by the 13th. The replanting of 320 mu of cotton fields lacking seedlings in the five villages of Libao, etc., was basically completed by the 13th, ensuring full seedlings for the 3,100 mu of cotton fields already planted in the six villages of improved No. 2 Si cotton strain. Currently, these six villages have launched a weeding and aphid prevention campaign, and the first round of weeding will be completed by the 25th.

　　河北满城宋贾村良棉区
    缺苗棉田补种完毕         
    现正展开锄草防蚜运动
    【本报满城讯】河北满城县宋贾等六个种斯字二号棉的村，为了保种保收，自本月九日以来展开了查苗、补苗运动。至本月十二日止不足苗的四百四十亩棉田已基本上完成了点补。使三千一百多亩棉花全部保证了满苗。该六村有两千三百亩棉田，因雨大土地表层被打紧，雨停后，即发动群众全力抢扒，四天内即全部扒完，仅有四百四十亩棉田出苗不齐。为了保证良种纯洁，不补杂种、不改种别的庄稼。劳动模范宋洛学曾于本月七日由棉产指导区贷来一百三十斤棉籽后，当晚即召开了宋贾村的全体干部会议，指出保持纯种的重要性，号召群众一律点补斯字二号棉。次日全体干部进行了分片逐户的宣传动员，经过两三天的查苗、泡籽，于十日即普遍进行查补。因棉芽被吹干（雨后耩的浅了）不能出来的棉地，都又重新耩了斯字二号棉，全村毁了再种的仅十余亩。宋贾村九百亩棉田，仅有一百二十亩出八成苗，其他棉田棉芽出土都很良好。缺苗棉田在群众积极点补下，至十三日即基本上点补完了。李堡等五个村的三百二十亩不足苗的棉田，至十三日即基本上补种齐了，使六个斯字二号棉良种村已经播种的三千一百亩棉田保住了满苗。现该六村已展开锄草防蚜运动，二十五日即全部锄完头遍。
