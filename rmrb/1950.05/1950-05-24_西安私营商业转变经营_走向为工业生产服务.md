　　Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 23rd: Xi'an's private businesses are moving towards a path of normal development under the new circumstances of improved national financial and economic conditions and stable financial prices. According to statistics from the Trade Department of the Northwest Military and Political Committee, the opening, conversion, and closing of private businesses in Xi'an from January to April of this year specifically illustrate that any business suitable for the requirements of the New Democratic economy and beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood is gradually becoming consolidated and developed; conversely, any business relying on price fluctuations for speculation and unable to promote material exchange has gradually declined. In the four months, 337 new businesses opened, 267 closed, and 208 converted. Among the new businesses, the most numerous were those dealing in daily necessities, with 90; followed by fuel businesses, with 31; industrial raw materials businesses, with 19; major food businesses, with 19; hotels and inns, with 16; and transportation businesses, with 8. Aside from a few that converted to industry, the conversion of businesses was mainly inter-industry flow. The most numerous of the closed businesses were those dealing in daily necessities, with 90; tobacco, alcohol, and beverage businesses, with 50; jewelry businesses, with 10; and agency businesses, with 3. The increase or decrease in the number of businesses, including conversions, over the four months is roughly balanced; however, judging from the newly added hardware and electrical supplies businesses, industrial raw materials businesses, fuel businesses, and major food businesses, Xi'an's private businesses are developing in the direction of serving industrial production. Based on the above situation, the Trade Department pointed out that the direction of transformation of private businesses should, on the current sound foundation of stable finance and prices, first change the old business methods of the past, establish service for industrial and agricultural production and consumption; improve labor-management relations, and solve problems through consultation; and correct some industrialists' and businessmen's incorrect understanding; at the same time, the government will also strive to adjust the relationship between public and private enterprises, overcome the anarchic state of production, and enable public and private enterprises to unite and cooperate to jointly strive for developing production and prosperity of the economy.

　　西安私营商业转变经营
    走向为工业生产服务
    【新华社西安二十三日电】西安市私营商业在目前国家财政经济好转，金融物价稳定的新形势下，正走向正常发展的轨道。据西北军政委员会贸易部调查统计，本年度一至四月份西安市私营商业开业、转业、歇业的情况，具体说明了凡适合于新民主主义经济要求，有利于国计民生的商业，则逐渐趋向巩固与发展；反之，凡依靠物价波动投机取巧与不能促进物资交流的商业，已逐渐由萧条而趋于没落。四个月中计新开业三三七户，歇业二六七户，转业二零八户。新开业者以日用杂货业为最多，计九十户；其次，燃料业三十一户，工业原料业十九户，主要食品业十九户，旅馆客栈业十六户，运输业八户。转业商号除数户转入工业者外，其他均系各行业间的相互流转。歇业的亦以日用杂货业最多，计九十户，烟酒饮料业五十户，首饰业十户，代理业三户等。四个月来，包括转业在内的商业户数的增减是相抵的；而从新增加的五金电料业，工业原料业，燃料业，主要食品业等来看，西安市的私营商业是在向着为工业生产而服务的方向发展。贸易部根据上述情况，指出私营商业的改造方向，应该在目前金融物价稳定的良好基础上，首先改变过去旧的经营方法，确立为工农生产、消费服务；搞好劳资关系，以协商方式解决问题；并改正某些工商业家的不正确认识；而政府同时亦将努力调整公私企业关系，克服生产中的无政府状态使公私企业团结合作，共为发展生产，繁荣经济而努力。
