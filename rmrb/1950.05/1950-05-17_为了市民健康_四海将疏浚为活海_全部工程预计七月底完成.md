　　For the Health of Citizens
　　The Four Seas Will Be Dredged into a Living Sea
　　All Projects Expected to Be Completed by the End of July
　　[News Dispatch from the Beijing Municipal News Office] The drainage project for Beijing's Four Seas began on the 15th. The Four Seas are located in the northwestern part of the city, including Xihai (Jishuitan), Houhai (Shichahai), Qianhai (Shicha Qianhai), and Xiaohai (Xi Xiaodi), with a total area of approximately 200,000 square meters.
　　The Four Seas dredging project was not originally within this year's municipal construction project plan. However, because residents along the coast often dump garbage and sewage into the coastal ditches, causing a strong odor along the coast, which is most likely to breed mosquitoes and spread epidemics in the summer, greatly affecting the health of citizens, the Municipal People's Government decided to complete the Four Seas dredging project ahead of schedule.
　　The Four Seas were originally four dead seas. The main purpose of the dredging project is to turn them into living seas. The dredging method is as follows: Dig through the Taiping Bridge to allow the water from the northwest moat to flow in, and set up a sluice gate at Taiping Bridge; dig through Xihai and Houhai, and set up a sluice gate at Desheng Bridge; dig through Houhai and Qianhai, and set up a sluice gate at Yinding Bridge; dig through Qianhai and Xiaohai, and set up a sluice gate at Xiya Bridge. In this way, the water from the Four Seas can flow into Beihai from Xiya Bridge, and the dead seas can be turned into living seas. In addition, it is planned to fill in the coastal ditches and build stone revetments along the coast. A sluice gate will be built at the Yuyuhe underground culvert, specifically for discharging sewage. It is estimated that the entire Four Seas dredging project can be completed by the end of July.

### 为了市民健康　四海将疏浚为活海　全部工程预计七月底完成

　　为了市民健康
　　四海将疏浚为活海
　　全部工程预计七月底完成
    【京市新闻处讯】京市四海的排水工程已于十五日开始。四海位于城内西北部，包括西海（积水潭）、后海（什刹海）、前海（什刹前海）及小海（西小地），全部面积约为二十万平方公尺。
    疏浚四海工程原不在今年市政建设工程计划范围内，因沿海居民常把垃圾、秽水倾倒在沿海转沟里，致使沿岸发出很大臭味，在夏季最易使蚊虫繁殖及传播病疫，大大影响市民健康，故市人民政府决定提前完成疏浚四海工程任务。
    四海本是四个死海，疏浚工程主要是把它挖成活海，疏浚办法是：把太平桥处挖通，使西北护城河水流入，并在太平桥设水闸，把西海、后海挖通，在德胜桥设水闸；把后海、前海挖通，在银锭桥设水闸，把前海、小海挖通，在西压桥设水闸。这样四海水可由西压桥流入北海，死海就可变成活海，另外拟将沿海转沟填平，并在沿海修建石护岸，沿御河暗沟处修一水闸，专供排秽水用，预计四海全部疏浚工程可于七月底完成。
