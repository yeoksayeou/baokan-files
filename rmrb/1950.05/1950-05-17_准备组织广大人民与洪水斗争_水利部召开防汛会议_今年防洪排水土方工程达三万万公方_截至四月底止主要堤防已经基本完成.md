Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: The Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, in preparation for organizing the broad masses to fight against floods in the upcoming summer flood season, convened a national flood control conference on the 15th, initially summarizing the spring repair projects and discussing various flood control measures for this year. At the beginning of the meeting, Fu Zuoyi, Minister of the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government, delivered an opening speech. Guests including Chen Qiyuan, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and Li Piji, professor at Tsinghua University, also spoke successively. Subsequently, representatives from various regions reported on their work. The meeting is scheduled for seven days and will, based on the reports from representatives of various regions, initially review this year's repair and defense projects, propose the guidelines and tasks for this year's flood control work, and study and determine the organizational structure, leadership system, flood reporting methods, necessary materials, and budget for this year's flood control work, so as to grasp the situation, organize and utilize the strength of the masses, and overcome this year's floods.

This year's flood control and drainage projects across the country are unprecedented in scale, with earthwork reaching over 300 million cubic meters. Thanks to the active leadership of local people's governments and the arduous efforts of the people, major dikes have been basically completed by the end of April. In the East China region, over 100 million cubic meters of the 180 million cubic meters of projects have been completed. In the Central and Southern region, over 50 million cubic meters of the 71 million cubic meters have been completed. In the Yellow River area, over 7.6 million cubic meters of the 13 million cubic meters have been completed. In the North China region, over 10 million cubic meters of the 27 million cubic meters have been completed. Other areas such as East Suiyuan and North Mongolia have also completed a significant amount. According to reports from various regions, the remaining projects can be completed before the summer flood season. This is a great achievement. However, in the process of completing the projects, there have been instances of crudeness and waste, and the quality of many projects does not meet standards. Now, with the summer flood season approaching, we are on the eve of a great struggle against floods. The convening of this national flood control conference is to summarize experience, strengthen leadership, and victoriously meet this great struggle.

　　准备组织广大人民与洪水斗争
　　水利部召开防汛会议 
    今年防洪排水土方工程达三万万公方
　　截至四月底止主要堤防已经基本完成
    【新华社十五日讯】中央人民政府水利部为准备在即将到来的夏汛中组织广大人民与洪水斗争，于十五日召开全国防汛会议，初步总结春修工程，并讨论今年防汛各项措施。会议首由中央人民政府水利部傅作义部长致开幕词，来宾中有内务部陈其瑗副部长及清华大学教授李丕济均相继讲话。继由各地代表汇报工作。会议预定七日，将根据各地代表报告，初步检讨今年修防工程，提出今年防汛工作的方针与任务，并将研究确定今年防汛工作的组织机构、领导系统、报汛办法、必备物料与经费预算，以便掌握情况，有组织地发挥群众力量，战胜今年的洪水。
    今年全国各地防洪排水工程，规模空前，土方工程达三万万公尺以上，由于各地人民政府的积极领导和人民群众的艰巨努力，截至四月底止，主要堤防已基本完成。计华东区一万八千余万公方工程中，已完成一万万公方以上；中南区七千一百余万公方中，已完成五千余万公方；黄河一千三百余万公方中，已完成七百六十余万公方；华北区二千七百余万公方中，已完成一千余万公方；其他如东余万北区和内蒙也已完成很大的数量。据各地报告，所余工程在夏汛前都可完成。这是一个伟大的成绩。但各地在完成工程的过程中，存在着粗糙和浪费现象，不少工程质量不合标准。现在夏汛期近，正处在与洪水大斗争的前夜。此次全国防汛会议的召开，就是为了总结经验、加强领导，以胜利地迎接这一大斗争。
