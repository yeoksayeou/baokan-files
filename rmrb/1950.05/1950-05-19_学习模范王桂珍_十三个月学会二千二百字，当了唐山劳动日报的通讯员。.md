Tangshan Communication

　　Learning Model Wang Guizhen
　　Learned 2,200 Characters in Thirteen Months, Became a Correspondent for the Tangshan Labor Daily.
    Our Newspaper Special Correspondent Zhou Yaodong
    Wang Guizhen, a special model student in the Tangshan People's Cultural Center's Women's Literacy Class, is twenty-eight years old this year and comes from Daxiezhuang, near Tangshan. Her father is a farmer, and her brother is a part-time worker and farmer. From her teens, she was the main assistant in the family for doing housework and farming. After liberation, she entered the literacy class to study. In one year and one month, she went from being illiterate to reaching the cultural level of the first grade of elementary school, recognizing 2,200 characters and being able to read the Tangshan Labor Daily. In April, she wrote two communications for the Tangshan Labor Daily, both of which were published. The newspaper hired her as a correspondent. She also learned four complex compound numbers in arithmetic and can help her family with household accounts. In addition to her own studies, Wang Guizhen actively mobilized women in the village to attend night school and found five students herself (all of whom are working women from the village). In two months, her students learned up to 250 characters and at least 100 characters. She plans to teach five more students in the future, all of whom will learn more than 1,000 characters in half a year. In addition, she is also a propaganda and service team member of the Cultural Center and works very actively. Because of these achievements, all the students in the women's class recognize her as a learning model and a model little teacher; the Communist Youth League absorbed her as a league friend. Everyone put forward the slogan: "Learn from Wang Guizhen, follow Wang Guizhen's example."
    Wang Guizhen encountered many difficulties when she started learning. First of all, her father did not want her to go to school, fearing that school would delay the family's work. After several discussions, her father refused her every time. Later, she herself made a guarantee: "If it delays work, I will stop learning. Let's try it first." Only then was she allowed to go to school. After entering school, Wang Guizhen got up early and went to bed late, seizing spare time to review the day's lessons, and she worked with extra effort. She carried manure to the fields, pulled seedlings in the water paddies, participated in the autumn harvest, did needlework at home, and pushed the millstone. Not only did she not delay, but she did it even better than before. Now her father's attitude has completely changed. He often tells the people in the village: "Our Guizhen has become more energetic in her work since she started studying; she also often opens my mind and makes me understand some truths. Learning is really useful." "The master leads you to the door, but the practice depends on the individual; learning depends entirely on one's own efforts." This is Wang Guizhen's first lesson of experience in learning. Wang Guizhen took the first test after entering school, and she only got two out of ten characters correct. She felt very embarrassed and couldn't sleep well all night. But she was not discouraged and worked even harder. Her secret is: don't let go of even a drop of time, and learn whenever she is free: when cooking and pulling the bellows, use one hand to draw characters on the ground; when working in the fields in the autumn, she also brings books and notebooks, and she doesn't rest when others rest; she also recites when she gets on the bus. Therefore, she progressed quickly, and she got full marks on every test.
    "Writing more and keeping a diary is the best way to learn," she said: "Reciting three times is not as good as writing once. Writing a character three or four times makes it very solid in your memory. When writing, practice making sentences, and you will remember it faster." After learning a hundred characters, she often practiced writing sentences. After writing, she asked the teacher to correct them. After correcting them, she would read them and carefully ask the teacher about things she didn't understand, never being careless. Once, it was dark, and she ran to the Cultural Center to ask the teacher questions. After recognizing three hundred characters, Wang Guizhen began to write a diary every day, and she has never stopped since. At first, she couldn't grasp the center of writing a diary, so she asked the teacher to explain the method of keeping a diary. Gradually, it changed from writing a stream of consciousness to having content. After writing her diary every day, she first reads it several times herself, and if it doesn't sound smooth, she corrects it. After sending it to the teacher for correction, she carefully reads it again, figuring out why the teacher made the corrections, so the next time she writes, it will be better than the previous time. Now, her diary has almost become a common reading material for all the students in the women's literacy class. Everyone says: "Wang Guizhen writes a good diary."

### 学习模范王桂珍　十三个月学会二千二百字，当了唐山劳动日报的通讯员。

　　学习模范王桂珍
　　十三个月学会二千二百字，当了唐山劳动日报的通讯员。
    本报特约通讯员　周耀东
    唐山市人民文化馆妇女识字班的特等模范王桂珍，今年二十八岁，唐山近郊达谢庄人。父亲是农民，哥哥半作工半种地。她从十几岁起，就是家中作活、种地的主要助手。解放后，她进了识字班学习，在一年零一个月当中，她由一字不识，达到了高小一年级的文化程度，认识了二千二百个字，能看唐山劳动日报了。四月里，她给唐山劳动日报写了两篇通讯，都发表了。报社聘请她当了通讯员。她还学到了四则复名数的算术，能帮助家里料理生活账。除了自己学习之外，王桂珍还在村里积极动员妇女上夜校，自己又找了五个学生（全是村里的劳动妇女）。在二个月中，她的学生最多的认识了二百五十个字，最少的一百个字。她计划将来还要教五个学生，在半年里都学会一千个字以上。此外，她还是文化馆的宣传队员和服务队员，工作非常积极。由于她有这些成绩，全妇女班的同学都公认她是学习模范和模范小先生；青年团吸收她做了团友。大家提出口号：“向王桂珍看齐，向王桂珍学习”。
    王桂珍开始学习时，曾碰到不少困难。首先是父亲不叫她上学，怕上学耽误了家里工作。几次的商量，她父亲均拒绝了她。后来她自己提出了保证：“要耽误作活时，再不学了。先试试看。”这样才被允许上学了。入学以后，王桂珍早起晚睡，将当日的功课抓紧空闲时间温习，作活也特别起劲。她下地倒粪，在水地里拔苗，秋天参加秋收，在家里作针线活，推碾子，不但不耽误，反而作得比以前更好了。现在她父亲的态度完全改变了，时常和庄里人说：“我们桂珍从学习后，作活更加劲了；还经常给我开脑筋，使我也明白一些道理。学习真有用。”“师傅领进门，修行在个人，学习全靠自己下工夫。”这是王桂珍学习的第一条经验。王桂珍入学后头一次考试，考十个字只写对了两个。自己挺不好意思，回去一晚上也没有睡好觉。但是她没有灰心，更加使劲学。她的秘诀是：一滴一点时间也不放过，有空就学：作饭拉风箱时，用一只手在地下划字；秋天下地也带着书本和笔记本，人家休息，她不休息；上车的时候她还背书。因此她进步很快，每次考试都得满分。
    “多写，记日记，是最好的学习方法”，她这样说：“念三遍不如写一遍，一个字写三、四遍就记的很扎实。写的时候，练习造句，记的更快。”她学了一百个字后，就经常练习写话，写完就叫老师改，改了就看，不明白的地方认真地去问老师，绝不马虎。有一次天黑了，她还跑到文化馆去问老师。识三百个字以后，王桂珍就开始每天写日记，一直到现在从来没有间断过。最初，写日记抓不着中心，她就请老师讲了记日记的方法。慢慢地，由写流水账一样变成有内容了。她每天写了日记后，自己先看几遍，不顺口就改。送去请老师改了以后，自己再仔细看，捉摸着老师为什么要这样改，下次写时就比前一次好了。现在，她的日记差不多变成了妇女识字班全班同学的共同读物。大家都说：“王桂珍日记写的好”。
