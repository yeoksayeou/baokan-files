Worker-Director Liu Yingyuan
By our reporter Feng Zhong

Liu Yingyuan, the director of Shijingshan Power Plant, started as an apprentice in a factory at the age of fourteen. He endured more than thirty years of hardship before finally gaining liberation after the liberation of Harbin in 1946. While repairing No. 5 generator at the Harbin Power Plant, Liu Yingyuan was elected as a first-class labor hero. Later, he created the feat of merging generators No. 5 and No. 6, ensuring the electricity supply for Harbin. He was selected as a special-class labor hero and attended the Sixth National Labor Congress as a representative. During this period, he gloriously joined the Chinese Communist Party. Afterwards, he became the director of the Harbin Power Plant. When Changchun was liberated, he was transferred to Changchun to undertake the task of quickly restoring power generation. After leaving Changchun, he became the deputy director of the Fushun Power Plant. This March, he was transferred to Beijing as the director of the Shijingshan Power Plant.

The workers of the Shijingshan Power Plant all know that their director is a hero who came from the working class, so they affectionately call him "Old Hero Liu."

Director Liu pays special attention to the workers' study. He tells the workers, "Comrades! We have been liberated and become masters, we can't do without studying!" He is even more concerned about the workers' lives. On the third day of his arrival, he went to inspect all the workers' dormitories in detail. He saw that many workers lived in small, leaky mud houses, some with families of six crammed into a mud house little more than ten feet square. The factory had recently built some new houses, and after he arrived, he decided to allocate them first to the workers with the most difficulties. Recently, the factory has also been preparing to build twenty-five houses as workers' dormitories, and it has been decided to quickly repair those dormitories that are in too bad a condition.

Originally, Old Hero was the most talkative person, but at the mass meeting of all the workers and staff on the morning of March 22, he only made a few brief remarks. Later, when someone asked him about it, he said, "The factory doesn't have a large auditorium, and the workers are standing in the open air freezing in such cold weather, what am I doing talking so grandly on the stage?" A few days ago, it rained, and the workers were working in the open air, their cotton clothes soaked through, shivering with cold, but they didn't delay production at all. Old Liu felt heartbroken when he saw this, and still often blames himself, saying, "This is all the responsibility of the administration. We should have prepared raincoats for the workers working in the open air long ago. The workers' health is important, what if they get sick from the rain?"

A director from the working class is different. Old Hero Liu can talk to all the workers in the factory. Whenever he has time, he runs to the workshop to talk to the workers, telling them how to operate the machines, asking about everything: "Is there anything wrong with the machine?" "Filter the oil! Is there water in the oil?" In the end, he always says: "Comrades! Study hard!" Every morning, he goes from the dormitory to the factory building, often detouring to inspect the boiler room, turbine plant, electrical plant, and transportation plant. After work starts, he runs to any place where there is important work to see what is going on. After dinner, he can also be found at the club, "Comrades! Let's play a couple of games!" He calls every worker "comrade," and some workers have slowly started calling him "comrade" too. How could the workers not be happy to have such a caring director? The workers tell Old Liu all kinds of opinions and the words buried in their hearts. Old Hero Liu once told the workers: "In the past, you had to be good at flattering, and give the director some pork and chicken during the New Year and holidays, but now we don't need that. If you want to give the director a gift, give more rationalization proposals." Therefore, wherever he goes, he is often stopped by workers who call out: "Director! Comrade! Let's talk." Workers often run to the dormitory to find him.

Old Hero cherishes everything in the factory, especially the machines. He doesn't take them lightly at all. He said to the workers, "If the machine breaks down and we have a power outage, all the factories will stop working, Chairman Mao knew that back then." When he first arrived at the Capital Power Plant, he happened to be in time for the overhaul of No. 3 generator, and he went to watch the repair of the machine whenever he had time. One night, the pointer of No. 5 generator was shaking particularly violently, from 2,000 kilowatts to 12,000 kilowatts. He rushed to see it as soon as he received the report, and decided to stop it for repair at that time. A few days ago, the sound of No. 6 generator was not normal. After listening carefully, he called for it to be stopped for inspection. If it was forced to run, it could be damaged. At the staff and worker representative meeting, a worker suggested that "the ash gate of the ash channel has a problem." He personally ran to test it twice, proving that the gate was still working well. The worker was very satisfied and said: Whenever there is something to ask the director, he can decide what to do and it is always right. He often says to everyone: "The boilers in Shijingshan Power Plant are three generations old (because there are new-style pulverized coal furnaces and the oldest low-pressure furnaces), a little carelessness can cause big trouble; we can learn more skills through regular maintenance!"

Old Hero grew up in factories for decades. He felt heartbroken when he saw so many useful materials placed in the open air in the factory. He immediately asked the person in charge to find a way to settle and clean up. One day, he saw outsiders using the factory's tap water, and he said: "Those who are not from the factory must be charged for using the water, we must be strict when necessary."

The Shijingshan Power Plant is very different than before. Through the joint efforts of the Party, government, labor union, and Youth League, a formal factory management committee has been established, with ten workers serving as members of the management committee. Democracy within the factory has been developed. It is no longer like the temporary management committee where the workers were only "attending as guests" and could not speak or understand what was going on (because the staff and engineers spoke English at the meetings). At the recent staff and worker representative meeting, the workers made one hundred and twenty-eight suggestions, 80% of which were related to production. The workers are working harder and harder. Here are a few recent examples:

Worker Liu Mingqing, together with the shift leader and foreman, put forward a rationalization proposal that made the "closed water supply door" have the function of automatically adjusting the water level, so that the entire water system of the factory was able to operate stably, and it was no longer necessary to burn low-pressure furnaces to supplement steam and water, which greatly reduced production costs. The foundry department of the repair shop accepted the task of casting 3,750 furnace bars. Under the active leadership of Party member Dou Guipu, the work that was originally scheduled for fifteen days was completed in seven days. Liu Baoyuan, who is eighteen years old, worked hard on the second day of Director Liu's arrival and turned out seventy-nine ball bearings a day, more than doubling the output and improving the quality. April 23rd was Sunday. In addition to the workers who were overhauling machines and boilers, hundreds of people from the factory automatically worked overtime to clean up the equipment thrown in the open air.

With the leadership of Director Liu, all the workers of the power plant are excitedly adding strength to production and shouting slogans: Observe labor discipline, cherish machines, eliminate accidents, prevent fires, prevent special agents, and ensure that the capital will always shine brightly.

　　工人厂长刘英源
    本报记者  冯仲
    石景山发电厂厂长刘英源，从十四岁起就到工厂当学徒，熬过了三十多年的艰辛岁月，到一九四六年哈尔滨解放后他才翻了身。刘英源在哈尔滨发电厂修理五号机时，当选为一等劳动英雄。后来他又创造将五、六两号发电机合并的事迹，保证了哈市的用电。被选为特等劳动英雄及出席全国第六次劳大代表。就在这个时期，光荣地加入了中国共产党。再后，他当了哈尔滨发电厂厂长，直到长春解放时，他又被调到长春担当迅速恢复长春发电的任务；离开长春后他当了抚顺发电厂的副厂长，今年三月又被调到北京当石景山发电厂厂长。
    石景山发电厂职工们都知道他们的厂长是一位英雄工人出身，所以就亲敬地称他做“刘老英雄”。
    刘厂长特别注意工人同志的学习问题，他告诉工人们说：“伙计！咱们翻身当了主人，不学习可不成啊！”他更关心工人的生活，当他到厂的第三天，就跑到各工人宿舍细看了一过。他见到许多工人住的土房子却又小又漏，有的工友一家六口住一间一丈多见方的小土房。厂子新近盖了一些房子，他到厂后就决定先分配给最困难的工友住。最近并准备建筑二十五幢房子作为工人宿舍，那些太坏的宿舍，也决定赶快修理。
    本来老英雄是最爱讲话的，但是在三月二十二日早晨全厂职工群众大会上，他却简短地讲了几句话。以后有人问到他，他说：“厂子没有个大礼堂，天这么冷，工友们在露天站着挨冻，咱还在台上高谈阔论些甚么？”前几天下雨，工人在露天干活，棉衣湿透了，冻得直哆嗦，但是一点没误生产。老刘看见这情形心又痛了，到今天还常自责地说：“这全是行政的责任，早就该给露天干活的工友准备下雨衣，工友们的健康要紧，浇病了怎么办？”
    工人出身的厂长就是不同，刘老英雄跟全厂工人都说得来，一得空就跑到工作间去找工人谈话，告诉工人怎么弄机器，问长问短：“机器有毛病没有”，“滤油哪！油里有水没有？”最后总是说：“伙计！好好学习吧！”他每天早晨由宿舍到厂房去，常常绕道去锅炉房、汽机厂、电气厂、运输厂看一遍。上班以后，那个地方有重要活，就一趟一趟地跑去看。晚饭后，在俱乐部里也不断有他的踪迹，“伙计！打两盘！”他称呼每一个工人都是伙计，有些工友也慢慢地称呼他伙计了。工人们遇到这样知心的厂长，怎能不痛快？怎能不高兴？工人们把各种意见，把埋在心里的话都向老刘厂长说出来。刘老英雄曾对工人说：“以前做事要会拍马，逢年过节得给厂长送点猪肉鸡子，现在可不要这个，要是想给厂长送礼，就多送合理化建议”。所以，他不管走到那儿，时常被工人喊住：“厂长！伙计！咱们谈谈”。工人还经常跑到宿舍去找他。
    老英雄对厂子里每一件东西都非常爱惜，尤其对机器丝毫都不马虎。他对工友们说：“机器出漏子，咱们一停电，各工厂也都停了工，毛主席当时就知道。”他刚到首都发电厂的时候，正赶上大修三号机，一有工夫就钉着去看修机器。一天夜里，五号机的表针晃的特别厉害，由二千千瓦晃到一万二千千瓦。他得到报告立刻跑去看了，当时决定停下来修。前几天六号机响声不太正常，他仔细听了，就叫停下来检查，如果勉强运转，就很可能遭到损坏。在职工代表会上，有工人提意见说“炉灰道放灰闸板有毛病”，他就亲自跑去试验搬两回，证明了闸板还好用，工友很满意，说：一有事找厂长，当时就能决定怎么办，办了准对。他常对大家说：“石景山发电厂锅炉是老少三辈（因为有新式的煤粉炉，也有最老式的低压炉），一马虎就出大漏子；咱们经常检修，更可以学习手艺啊！”
    老英雄生长在工厂里几十年，他在厂里看见露天地放着许许多多有用器材，心疼得了不得，他当时就让主管人想法子安置清理。有一天他看见外人用厂里的自来水，他就说：“不得厂子的人用水一定要收钱，该紧就得紧。”
    石景山发电厂比以前是大不同了。经过党、政、工、团的共同努力，正式的工厂管理委员会已经成立，有十个工人当了管委会委员，厂内民主有了开展，不像以前在临时管委会时，工人只是参加“作陪”，说也说不过，听也听不懂（因为开会时有职员、工程师说英文）。最近开职工代表大会，工人提了一百二十八条建议，有百分之八十是有关生产的意见。工人们干起活来越干越带劲。举几个最近的例吧：
    工人刘明清与值长、领班共同研究，提出合理化建议，使“密闭给水门”有了自动调解水面的作用，全厂整个水系得到稳定的运行，不必再烧低压炉补足汽水，大大减低生产成本。修理厂铸工部接受铸三千七百五十条炉条的任务，在党员都桂璞积极带头下，本来是十五天的活，七天就干完了。十八岁的刘宝元在刘厂长到厂第二天就努上力，一天旋出七十九个滚珠，产量增加一倍多，质量也很好。四月二十三是星期日，除去正在大修机器、锅炉的工人，全厂好几百人自动加班清理了抛在露天的器材。
    有了刘厂长领导，全发电厂工人都兴奋地在生产上加上劲，并喊出口号：遵守劳动纪律，爱护机器，消灭事故，防火，防特，保证首都永远大放光明。
