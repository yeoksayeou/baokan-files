　　Experience in Exceeding First Quarter Production Plan

　　Zhou Tian
    The total production value of the Beijing Electric Tram Company Repair Factory in the first quarter has exceeded the original production plan, achieving significant results.

    The factory's total production value exceeded the original plan by an average of 32.01%. Among them, the highest was the new locomotive production, exceeding the plan by 48.13%; the lowest was the repainting of old vehicles, which also exceeded the original plan by 16%.

    Looking at the three basic production tasks of new locomotives, major repaired locomotives, and trailers, the first quarter's production efficiency increased by an average of 31.6%. Among them, the highest was major repaired locomotives, with a production efficiency increase of 49.2%; the lowest was major repaired trailers, with a production efficiency increase of 8.6%. These three productions saved a total of 6,461 workdays in the whole quarter.

    The factory achieved great results in various aspects of conservation. Among them, a prominent example is using old trailer's discarded slide plates to modify and make locomotive frame rollers' beams, saving 210 kilograms of flat iron, equivalent to 1,760 catties of millet; using discarded car spring leaves to modify and make locomotive spring leaves, saving 384 kilograms of steel plate, equivalent to 10,000 catties of millet; maintaining vehicle lubrication saved a total of 396.7 kilograms, equivalent to 4,610 catties of millet.

    How were such great achievements made? This is because:

    First, when setting the production plan, everyone was deeply mobilized. The process of arranging the production plan was: first, the entire technical staff formulated the annual plan, and then made plans for January and February; then, according to work classification, the total work of each shift was specified. This served as a preliminary plan, which was taken to each shift for discussion and modification. Secondly, the work of each shift was further specifically assigned to each small group (groups of two or three people taking on (specific division of labor meaning) one or several kinds of work) or each individual. After repeated consultations and modifications, it was finally approved by the administration. In this way, everyone understood what their monthly work plan was, understood to what extent it was considered completed and exceeded the plan, and everyone had their own clear fighting goals.

    Second, the labor organization and work methods were preliminarily improved. This is an important reason for the improvement of production efficiency and exceeding the plan. After the individual plans were set, the workshops were required to cooperate closely, and then the unreasonable aspects of the labor organization were exposed and had to be improved. For example, ironworkers, in the past without a plan, their low efficiency was not obvious, and they just muddled through; now, with a plan, they felt that their work could not keep up with the needs of lathe operators and fitters, directly affecting the work of these two shifts and indirectly affecting the production of other shifts. In order to strengthen the supply, the past four-furnace operation was increased to the current day and night eight-furnace operation. In addition to two fixed people per furnace, a fixed set of tools was also fixed, doing fixed work (in the past, the tools were not complete, and the work and people were not fixed). The preliminary improvement of the labor organization greatly improved efficiency. The minimum increase per furnace exceeded the plan by 26%, and the maximum reached 67%. For example, in the past, the car-jacking shift was dedicated to minor repairs and medium repairs, and the major repair shift was dedicated to major repairs. The two shifts often had disputes over spare parts (preparing parts). After this plan was set, the two shifts competed to complete the plan, and there were more disputes. Therefore, after discussions with the section chief, shift leader, and all workers of the two shifts, it was decided to change the major repair shift to specialize in spare parts to supplement the insufficient supply of the North Car Depot; the car-jacking shift specialized in installation and repair. In this way, not only were there no disputes, but also there were no more "swung cars" after the end of February (i.e., cars broken down during the day could not be repaired and were dragged to the night; cars broken down at night could not be repaired and were dragged to the next day). The number of breakdowns decreased, the number of cars on the road increased, and materials were also saved.

    Third, a preliminary and practical reward system was established. Last year, because there was no practical plan, it was not known how much work each person had done, and no rewards could be given, so the workers were not motivated to produce. Now, because there is a practical individual plan, there is a standard for good and bad, and a reward method can be determined. In this way, the enthusiasm of the workers for production is promoted. The reward method is roughly: material rewards, according to the amount exceeding the plan, millet is awarded, both collective and individual awards (the highest collective award for the first time was 408 catties, and the highest individual award was 35 catties). Spiritual awards are limited to collective ones. In addition to big-character posters for commendation at ordinary times, there are also certificates of merit and red flags. The first place gets the red flag. The red flag award is a great encouragement to the shifts, and the shifts have launched an invisible competition to win the red flag. Of course, this method still has great shortcomings because there is no spiritual reward for individuals and the rewards are not timely enough.

    Fourth, the cooperation of the Party, government, labor union, and youth league, focusing on production. This is one of the basic conditions for formulating and implementing the production plan. In the repair factory, because the Party, government, labor union, and youth league are very united, as soon as the administration proposes to set a plan, all parties will jointly study and arrange it separately. In the process of formulating and implementing the plan, due to the expansion of the Party organization and the increase of its prestige, not only can Party members and league members generally play a leading exemplary role, but also actively help the administration together with the labor union to jointly organize and lead the discussion and implementation of the production plan.

    However, these production achievements of the repair factory are only preliminary. If it can be coordinated with the production plan to further establish an acceptance system for finished products and semi-finished products to improve quality; improve the existing reward system to continue to increase and consolidate the enthusiasm of employees for production; strengthen the existing rationalization proposals and enlighten workers' wisdom, then the production situation of the repair factory will be developed more rapidly.

　　电车公司修造厂
　  超过首季生产计划的经验
　　周天
    北京市电车公司修造厂第一季的生产总额，业已超过了原定的生产计划，获得了重大成绩。
    该厂总生产额平均超过了原计划的百分之三十二点零一。其中，最高者为新造机车，超过计划达百分之四十八点一三；最低者为油饰旧车，也超过了原计划的百分之十六。
    再从新造机车、大修机车和拖车等三项基本生产任务来看，第一季生产效率较平均提高了百分之三十一点六。其中，最高者为大修机车，其生产效率较提高百分之四十九点二；最低者为大修拖车，其生产效率亦较提高百分之八点六。此三项生产，全季共节省六千四百六十一工。
    该厂各项节约均有很大成绩。其中，突出的例子是利用老拖车废滑板改作机车架滚子的大梁，节省扁铁二一○公斤，折合小米一七六○斤；利用废车弓子板改作机车弓子板簧，节省钢板三八四公斤，折合小米一○○○○斤；维持行车润油共节省三九六点七公斤，折小米四六一○斤。
    怎么会造成这样大的成绩呢？这是因为：
    第一、订生产计划时，深入动员了每一个人。布置生产计划的过程是：首先，由全体技术人员订出全年计划，再作出一、二月份的计划；然后按工作分类，规定出每班的总工作。这就作为初步的计划，拿到各班去讨论，加以修改。其次，把每一班的工作，再具体分配到每一小组（二人或三人抱（具体分工的意思）一种活或几种活的小组）或每一个人，经过多次的磋商，修改，最后经行政审定。这样一来，使每一个人都明了自己一个月的工作计划是什么，了解达到何种程度才算完成和超过了计划，每一个人都有了自己鲜明的奋斗目标。
    第二、初步地改善了劳动组织和工作方法。这是生产效率提高和超过计划的重要原因。在个人计划定出之后，就要求车间与车间的紧密配合，于是，劳动组织不合理的地方就暴露出来，必须加以改善。如铁工，过去没有计划，显不出效率低，马马虎虎就过去了；现在，一有了计划，就感觉到做活赶不上镟工、钳工的需要，直接影响这两班的工作，间接影响其他各班的生产。为了加强供应，于是，由过去四盘炉增加为现在的日夜八盘炉。每盘除有固定的两个人外，又固定了一套工具，做固定的工作（过去工具不齐，工作和人也不固定）。劳动组织初步加以改善，效率大为提高。每盘最少的超过计划百分之二十六，最多的达百分之六十七。再如过去架车班专作碎修和中修，大修班专作大修，两班时常因争备品（准备零件）而发生争执。这次订出计划后，两班为完成计划而竞争着，争执更多，于是，经股长、班长和两班全体工人讨论，决定将大修班改为专作备品，以补北车房的供应不足；架车班专作安装、修理。如此，不仅争执没有了，并且二月底以后再没有甩车了（即白天坏车修不好，拖到晚上；晚上坏车修不好，拖到第二天），坏车次数少了，出车多了，材料也省了。
    第三、建立初步的切合实际的奖励制度。去年因为没有切实的计划，不知道每一个人究竟作了多少活，也不能奖励，工人生产便不起劲。现在，因为有了切实的个人计划，好坏有了标准，奖励办法也就可以定出来了。这样，便促进了工人生产的积极性。奖励办法大致是：物质奖，按超过计划的多少，奖给小米，集体、个人都有奖（第一次集体奖最高的是四○八斤，个人奖最高的是三五斤）。精神奖，只限于集体的，除平时有大字报表扬外，还有奖状和红旗两种。得红旗的是第一名。红旗奖对于各班的鼓励很大，各班在无形中已展开了夺红旗的竞赛。当然，这办法因为没有对个人的精神奖励，奖励也不够及时等等，仍然有很大缺点。
    第四、党政工团的配合，面向生产。这是制定生产计划和贯彻生产计划的基本条件之一。在修造厂，因为党政工团很团结，所以行政一提出订计划，各方面就共同研究，分头布置。在制定和执行计划的过程中，由于党组织的扩大，威信增高，所以不仅党团员一般能起带头模范作用，并能和工会一起积极帮助行政共同组织和领导对生产计划的讨论和执行。
    但是修造厂的这些生产成绩还只是初步的，如果能配合生产计划，进一步建立对于成品和半成品的验收制度，提高质量；健全已有的奖励制度，继续提高与巩固职工的生产热情；加强已有的合理化建议，启发工人的智慧，则修造厂的生产情况更会得到迅速的发展。
