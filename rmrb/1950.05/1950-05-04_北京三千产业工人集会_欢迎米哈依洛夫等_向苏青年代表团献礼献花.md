　　Beijing Three Thousand Industrial Workers Gather
    Welcoming Mikhailov, etc.
    Presenting Gifts and Flowers to the Soviet Youth Delegation
    [Reported by this newspaper] Industrial workers in Beijing, coming from various factories with gongs and drums, arrived at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant to welcome Comrade Mikhailov and other representatives of the Soviet Youth Delegation.

    At the welcoming meeting, Mikhailov introduced to the more than three thousand workers the achievements of Soviet workers in production and their happy life. He said: The Soviet people are always concerned about the struggle of the Chinese people. Although Moscow and Beijing are geographically far apart, the hearts of the Chinese and Soviet people are closely linked. The Soviet people are overjoyed by the victory of the Chinese people. He believed that the great and hardworking Chinese people and Chinese workers will create a brilliant and splendid future. The unity of the Chinese and Soviet people is the pillar of defending world peace and a heavy blow to warmongers. Then, Rozhneva and Marysheva spoke to the workers about the achievements of Soviet workers and their own work. They unanimously stated that these achievements were the result of Soviet workers' infinite concern for the future of their motherland and the development of the national economy. Stakhanovite workers cannot be satisfied with their own achievements, but must constantly improve their technology, work hard to save, and create higher records. These words were a great encouragement to the Chinese workers.

    Amidst stormy cheers and songs, the workers of Beijing presented gifts and flowers to the representatives. Workers from the printing factory presented a photo of Chairman Mao carved by themselves. The trade union of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant presented the medals awarded to the labor models of their factory to Comrade Mikhailov and four other representatives. The iron smelting plant of the factory presented a model of the blower furnace cast from the first furnace of iron after liberation to the delegation.

    The workers of the iron smelting plant had just finished their shift, bare-chested and still sweating, when they greeted Comrade Mikhailov and others who came to visit. They enthusiastically surrounded Comrade Mikhailov and other representatives, shaking hands, cheering, and singing in a powerful voice: "We workers have strength!"

    When saying goodbye to the workers of Shijingshan, Comrade Mikhailov shook hands tightly with the secretary of the Youth League branch of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. He said with sincere friendship: "I will definitely tell the Soviet young workers about the production and life of the Chinese workers. I hope you work hard to complete the production plan, exceeding it by one, two, or three times. New China needs steel and industry so much!"

　　北京三千产业工人集会
    欢迎米哈依洛夫等
    向苏青年代表团献礼献花
    【本报讯】北京市的产业工人们，从各个工厂打着锣鼓来到石景山钢铁工厂，欢迎米哈依洛夫同志和苏联青年代表团的其他代表们。
    欢迎大会上，米哈依洛夫向三千多工人介绍了苏联工人们在生产上的成绩和美满幸福的生活。他说：苏联人民随时都关心着中国人民的斗争，莫斯科和北京虽然在地理上离开很远，但中苏两国人民的心却紧紧连在一起，苏联人民为中国人民的胜利而欢欣鼓舞。相信伟大的、勤劳的中国人民和中国工人一定会创造出光辉灿烂的前途。中苏两国人民的团结是保卫世界和平的支柱，对战争挑拨者是沉重的打击。接着由罗日聂娃、玛雷舍娃对职工们讲了苏联工人和自己工作的成绩。他们一致表示，这些成绩的产生是由于苏联工人们无限关心自己祖国的前途和国民经济的发展的结果。斯达哈诺夫运动者不能满足于自己的成绩，而要不断地提高技术，努力节约，创造出更高的纪录。这些话对于中国工人是莫大的鼓励。
    在暴风雨般的欢呼和歌声中，北京市职工们向代表们送上礼物和鲜花，印刷厂工人送上自己雕刻的毛主席照片，石景山钢铁工厂工会把奖励自己工厂劳动模范的奖章赠给米哈依洛夫同志和其他四位代表，该厂炼铁厂用解放后第一炉铁铸成的鼓风炉模型赠给代表团。
    炼铁厂工人刚下班，赤裸着上身，汗还没干，就迎上了米哈依洛夫同志等的参观。他们热情地围绕着米哈依诺夫同志和其他代表握手、欢呼，用雄壮有力的声音高唱着：《咱们工人有力量！》
    同石景山工人告别时，米哈依洛夫同志紧紧地握着石景山钢铁厂青年团支部书记的手，他充满了真挚的友爱说：“我一定把中国工人生产、生活的情形告诉苏联青年工人，望你们努力工作，完成生产计划，一倍、两倍、三倍地超过它，新中国多需要钢铁和工业！”
