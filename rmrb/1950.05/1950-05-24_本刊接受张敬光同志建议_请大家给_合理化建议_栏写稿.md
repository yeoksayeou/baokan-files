　　This Journal Accepts Comrade Zhang Jingguang's Suggestion: Please Contribute to the "Rationalization Proposal" Column

To the Editors:
　　I have the following hope for our newspaper: to open a "Rationalization Proposal" column in the People's Forum, to widely solicit suggestions from the people of the whole country on economics, culture, construction, and even national affairs and policies, and to give commendations or rewards (to be the responsibility of relevant departments) based on their effectiveness. It is true that factories, mines, and railways are now carrying out this movement, but that is only limited to a portion of the employees within their respective scopes. There are still more people who will come up with better opinions.
                     Zhang Jingguang, General Affairs Department, Taiyuan Railway Bureau

Editor's Note: Comrade Zhang Jingguang's suggestion is very good, and we fully agree. We hope that everyone will actively contribute to the "Rationalization Proposal" column in the People's Forum.

　　本刊接受张敬光同志建议
    请大家给“合理化建议”栏写稿编辑同志：
    我对咱们的报纸有这样的希望：在人民园地内再辟一“合理化建议栏”，广泛的征求全国人民对经济、文化、建设，甚至国是，政策中的建议，并根据其效果给以表扬或奖励（由有关部门负责）。不错，现在各工厂、矿山、铁路都在开展这一运动；但那只是限于各所属范围的一部分职工，还有更广大的人民会提出更好的意见。
                     太原铁路局总务处  张敬光
    编者按：张敬光同志的建议很好，我们完全同意。希望大家踊跃给人民园地写“合理化建议”栏的稿子。
