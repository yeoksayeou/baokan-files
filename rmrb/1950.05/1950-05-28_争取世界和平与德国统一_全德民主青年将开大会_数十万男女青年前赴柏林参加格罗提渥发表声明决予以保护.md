　　Striving for World Peace and German Reunification
    All-Germany Democratic Youth to Hold Congress
    Hundreds of Thousands of Young Men and Women Go to Berlin to Participate; Grotewohl Issues Statement Promising Protection
    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 27th] TASS, Berlin, 25th: As the All-German Youth Congress is about to be held in Berlin, the government of the German Democratic Republic has issued a statement signed by Prime Minister Grotewohl.
    The statement declared: "All peace-loving Germans welcome and support the All-German Youth Congress, because it serves the cause of peace. The warmongers are spreading slander in an attempt to create the impression that our youth's peaceful gathering is disrupting the tranquility of the German capital. In fact, no one is trying to use our youth, liberated from the influence of fascism and militarism, to 'attack' the people of West Germany. The imperialist warmongers are afraid of the voice of peace. They want to sow discord among young people and destroy the German youth's will to defend peace. However, the youth of all Germany will soon show that they have understood the lofty significance of fighting for peace.
    The government of the German Democratic Republic feels the closest connection with the young peace fighters. The parents of the German youth who are on their way to Berlin need not worry. They will certainly not encounter any misfortune in Berlin. The government of the German Democratic Republic guarantees good conditions for all participants in the All-German Youth Congress. The government of the German Democratic Republic protects all those who participate in the work of the All-German Youth Congress.
    Our goal is to build a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany in a planned way. The whole world must be able to hear and see: German youth is by no means a threat to other countries; they are preparing for labor and defending peace."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 27th] According to ADN, Berlin: As of the 24th, 20,000 Young Pioneer members from all over Germany have arrived in Berlin, preparing to participate in the All-German Democratic Youth Congress to be held in Berlin on Pentecost (May 28th). One hundred and forty trains and seven thousand vehicles are available for the participants to dispatch, in order to transport them to the German capital. The Congress continues to receive applications from hundreds of thousands of young people requesting to participate in the grand event, but the decision remains to maintain the original number of 500,000 people.
    More than 95 percent of the youth of the German Democratic Republic have signed the peace declaration of the World Peace Congress. They have also assisted in collecting 7.8 million signatures from all walks of life. In the youth's signature collection competition for peace in Paris, Rome, and Berlin, the Berlin youth collected 370,000 signatures, winning the competition.
    In the past six months, 288,112 young men and women have joined the Free German Youth League, and 215,947 have joined the Young Pioneers. The total number of people in the two groups has now reached 2,221,958.
    The Free German Youth has also made significant achievements on the economic construction front. They have widely participated in production surges and improving the quality of production. The number of youth shock worker teams participating in the competition has increased from 28,500 to 36,000, of which 4,500 are shock worker teams for improving production quality.

　　争取世界和平与德国统一
    全德民主青年将开大会   
    数十万男女青年前赴柏林参加格罗提渥发表声明决予以保护
    【新华社二十七日讯】塔斯社柏林二十五日讯：由于全德青年大会即将在柏林举行，德意志民主共和国政府特发表一项由总理格罗提渥签署的声明。
    声明宣称：“所有爱好和平的德国人，都欢迎而且支持全德青年大会，因为它是为和平事业服务的。战争贩子们散布谰言，企图借此造成一种印象，令人以为我们青年的和平联欢破坏了德国首都的安宁。事实上，并没有人要利用我们自法西斯主义和黩武主义影响之下解放出来的青年来“进攻”西德的人民。帝国主义的战争贩子们害怕和平的呼声。他们想在青年中间造成不和并且摧毁德国青年保卫和平的意志。但是，德国全国的青年即将表明，他们已经理解为和平而斗争的崇高意义。
    德意志民主共和国政府感觉到自身与年轻的和平战士有着最密切的联系。正在首途前来柏林的德国青年们的父母用不着担心。他们在柏林决不会遭遇什么不幸。德意志民主共和国政府担保给予全德青年大会所有参加者以良好的条件。德意志民主共和国政府保护所有参与全德青年大会工作的人。
    我们的目标就是有计划地建设统一的、民主的和爱好和平的德国。全世界一定可以听到而且看见：德国青年绝不是对别国的威胁，他们在准备着劳动和保卫和平。”
    【新华社二十七日讯】据电通社柏林讯：截至二十四日为止，已有二万名少年先锋队队员自全德各地抵达柏林，准备参加降灵节（五月二十八日）在柏林举行的全德民主青年大会。一百四十列火车和七千部车辆可供大会参加者调度，以运送他们到德国首都。大会继续收到数十万青年要求参加盛会的申请，但是决定仍维持原定的五十万人的数目。
    德意志民主共和国的青年，已有百分之九十五以上在世界和大常委会的和平宣言上签了名。他们并曾协助从社会各阶层中征集了七百八十万人的签名。在巴黎、罗马、柏林三地青年征集和平签名的竞赛中，柏林青年共征集了三十七万人签名，获得竞赛的胜利。
    在过去六个月中，有二十八万八千一百十二名男女青年参加了自由德国青年联盟，有二十一万五千九百四十七人参加了少年先锋队。合计两个团体的总人数，目前已达二百二十二万一千九百五十八人。
    在经济建设战线上，自由德国青年也有了显著的成就。他们广泛地参加了生产突击和改进生产质量的工作。参加竞赛的青年突击工人小组的数目，已自二万八千五百个增加到三万六千个，其中有四千五百个是改进生产质量的突击工人小组。
