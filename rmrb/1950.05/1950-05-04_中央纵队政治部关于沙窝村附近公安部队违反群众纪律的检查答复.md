Central Column Political Department's Reply Regarding the Investigation of Public Security Forces Violating Mass Discipline Near Sh窝 Village

To the Editor:
    Having received a letter forwarded by the North China Military Region from your newspaper regarding "Troops stationed in the Sh窝 Village area borrowing agricultural tools from local farmers, affecting spring plowing," the Second Division of the Column, under instruction, conducted an investigation, which essentially confirmed the facts. In mid-March, in order to complete air defense facilities to facilitate aerial combat, subordinate units borrowed some shovels from local residents. Because there were many military units stationed in the area, and the current borrowing procedures were not sound enough, there were instances of overdue returns (carts) and damage without timely compensation (hoes, shovels).
    Now, the Political Department of the Second Division, in cooperation with the local CCP District Committee, the government work team, village chiefs, and resident group leaders, has conducted a thorough investigation. In addition to apologizing and providing compensation to local residents, the troops have also undergone strict discipline education. This issue has now been basically resolved satisfactorily, and the farmers have responded well. We hereby inform you of this.

### 中央纵队政治部关于沙窝村附近公安部队违反群众纪律的检查答复

     中央纵队政治部关于沙窝村附近公安部队违反群众纪律的检查答复编辑同志：
    前接华北军区转来报社关于《沙窝村一带所驻部队借用当地农民农具影响农民春耕》一信，经纵队指令二师检查，基本上是符合事实。三月中旬所属部队为完成防空设备，以便对空作战之指示，曾向当地群众借一部铁锹，因该地驻军番号较多，再加上当前借物手续还不够健全，因而曾发生过借物逾期不还（大车），损坏了没有及时赔偿的现象（镢头、铁锹）。
    现在二师政治部协同当地中共区委及政府工作组、村长、居民组长进行彻底清查，除向当地居民进行道歉、赔偿外，在部队内又进行了严格整顿纪律的教育。这问题，现在基本上已得圆满解决，农民反映很好，特此函告。
