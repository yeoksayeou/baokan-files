Why Biyu Wheat Has Spread Across the Fields of Song County
Introducing an Excellent Wheat Variety
Farmers from Beiyao Village and Shangdian Village, Song County: Zhang Xihua, Sun Ming, Liu Fuxing, Fan Qing, Zhao Gousheng

In the vast countryside, there are many excellent seeds, each with its own excellent characteristics. However, because we have failed to select and maintain their characteristics in a planned and organized manner, many good varieties have gradually become mixed and even degraded. This is something that deserves serious attention. It is hoped that the publication of this article by Zhang Xihua and others, farmers from Song County, Henan, will attract the attention of agricultural workers in various regions, prompting them to delve into the countryside, identify varieties, and mobilize the masses to select and preserve good seeds locally, so that the historically significant five-year plan for popularizing good seeds can be successfully completed on schedule.

The People's Government vigorously promotes production and pays attention to the issue of grain seed selection. Based on our many years of experience, we believe this is absolutely correct. The widespread cultivation of "洋麦" (Yáng mài, foreign wheat) in our county is an example. Now, we will introduce the cultivation and promotion of this wheat below.

This wheat is called Biyu Wheat, but people mostly know it as Yangmai. It was brought back from outside by a person in our county who studied agriculture. Initially, it was a small package of seeds, and people were reluctant to plant it, so he planted half a mu of land himself. When harvested, it yielded more than six dou (斗, a unit of dry volume) (thirty-three jin (斤, a unit of weight) per dou using the old scale), which was 40% more than our ordinary wheat. So, these six dou of wheat were exchanged by many people for seed wheat, and the planted area expanded from half a mu to dozens of mu. At harvest time, the average yield was one shi (石, a unit of dry volume) and one dou per mu on irrigated land, and seven dou and six sheng (升, a unit of dry volume) per mu on dry land, which was also 30% to 40% more than local wheat. In the third year, the area expanded from dozens of mu to more than 300 mu. Unfortunately, it suffered from a devastating locust plague, which broke the wheat stalks. However, while other wheat died, Biyu Wheat sprouted again from below, and eventually, half of it was harvested. This is something that local wheat could not match. Then, the Japanese invaders arrived, and farmers could not cultivate the land properly. Although this wheat still grew everywhere, the seeds became mixed. Therefore, we informed the person who originally brought back the seeds about this situation. He was in Yunnan at that time, and he entrusted someone to bring back new seeds. Before these seeds could be planted, they were eaten by the Kuomintang soldiers. Since then, we have paid attention to preserving the seeds, and although the wheat grains are not as large as they were initially, the yield and other advantages are still unmatched by local wheat, so it continues to grow on the vast fields. Its advantages are: (1) It is drought-resistant because its roots are deep and absorb more water; (2) It does not have black loose smut disease; (3) It is not prone to insects, and it can still sprout after being bitten by locusts; (4) The grains do not shatter when ripe; (5) The stalks are thick and the leaves are strong when ripe, so it does not fall over in the wind; (6) The wheat grains are two to three times larger than local wheat, and each dou (thirty-three jin) weighs two to three jin more; (7) The flour is particularly white, and the gluten is very strong; (8) The taste is particularly good; (9) It yields seven or eight jin more white flour than local wheat (when milling seventy-five jin of white flour); (10) It yields one-third to two-thirds more wheat straw than local wheat. However, it is important to note that this wheat requires a lot of fertilizer to provide it with sufficient nutrients to grow strong and healthy. When planting, it should be sparser than local wheat by half, because its plants are large, and one seed produces many seedlings. Another advantage is that the weeds in the field cannot compete with it and are suffocated, so it is difficult to find weed seeds in this wheat field.

It is said that this wheat is suitable for most areas in Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui and other provinces, so we are introducing it to everyone for your selection.

　　为什么碧玉麦长遍了嵩县的田野
    介绍一种小麦优良品种
    嵩县北窑村、上店村农民  张西华  孙明  刘福星  樊庆  赵狗胜
    在广大农村中原有很多优良种子，这些良种都各有其优良的特性，只因为我们未能有计划有组织的选种和保持其特性，致好多良种逐渐混杂而甚至退化了。这是非常值得注意的。希望由于河南嵩县农民张西华等这篇来稿的发表，引起各地农业工作者的重视，深入农村、检定品种，并就地发动群众进行选种和保持良种，使具有历史意义的五年普及良种计划，能够胜利的如期完成。
                                        ——编者
    人民政府大力提倡生产，并且注意到粮食选种的问题，我们由于这很多年的经验，认为这是绝对的对。我们县里普遍种植了洋麦，便是一个例子，现在我们把这麦子种植及推广的情形介绍在后面。
    这麦子叫碧玉麦，人民不尽知道它的名字，就叫它为洋麦。是我们县里一位学农的人，由外面带回来的。最早是一小包种子，人民不肯种，他自己就种了半亩地。等到收的时候，打了六斗（三十三斤老秤的斗）多，比我们普通的麦子要多打四成。于是这六斗麦子就被很多人把它换来作麦种，种的地由半亩到几十亩，收的时候，水地平均每亩一石一斗，旱地每亩七斗六升，也较本地麦多打三成到四成。第三年就由几十亩扩展到了三百多亩。但是不幸的遭到了遮天的蝗虫大灾，把麦子都咬断了。但是后来别的麦都死了，碧玉麦却又从下面发了出来，最后还收了一半。这一点是本地麦远远不如的。接着日寇到境，农民不能好好耕种，这麦子虽还长满在地上，而种子无形中都变杂了。于是我们把这情形告给原带回种子的人，他那时还在云南，他就又托人带回新的种子，这种子还没有等到种在地里，国民党的兵就把它吃掉了。以后我们就注意保种，一直到现在，麦粒虽然没有当初的大，而产量和其他的长处还是本地麦赶不上的，所以它还生长在遍野的大地上。它的好处是：（一）因为根深吸水多，耐旱；（二）没有黑穗病；（三）不易生虫，蝗虫咬了也还能发；（四）成熟时麦粒不脱；（五）成熟时因为杆子粗，叶子壮，风刮不倒；（六）麦粒比本地麦大二倍到三倍，每斗（三十三斤）重量多二斤到三斤；（七）麦粉特别白，粉质也很有劲；（八）面味特别好；（九）比本地麦（磨七十五斤白面）多磨七八斤白面；（十）麦杆比本地麦多收三分之一到三分之二。但是还要注意的是种这麦子要肥料大，才能供足它上长肥壮，种时要比本地麦稀一半，因为它的棵大，一个麦子发的苗也多。另外还有一个好处，就是地里的杂草争不过它，都被它吸死，所以这麦子里很不容易找到草子。
    据说：这麦子在河南、河北、山东、安徽等省里，大部分是适宜的，所以我们特别介绍给大家，请大家选用。
