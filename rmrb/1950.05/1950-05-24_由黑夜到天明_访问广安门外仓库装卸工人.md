　　From Night to Dawn
    Visiting Warehouse Loading and Unloading Workers Outside Guang'anmen
    By our reporter Feng Zhong
    After the loading and unloading workers at the warehouses outside Guang'anmen, Beijing, overthrew the "Lobbying Boss" Li Ming, the workers were overjoyed. Under the leadership of their trade union, they began a new life of freedom and happiness. Now each worker earns an average of eleven or twelve *jin* of white flour a day. Cooperatives and canteens have also been established, the workers' lives have greatly improved, and they have all entered night school to begin learning culture. Worker Zeng Guangde said of their lives: "No one exploits us or oppresses us. We earn as much as we get, and life is much better. We all made new uniforms, and those who live far away even bought bicycles." Worker Chen Biyuan has a family of four—his wife and two children. He compared his past and present lives, saying: "Before, when working under Li Ming, we couldn't even get corn buns and pickled vegetables every day. We ate breakfast but didn't know about dinner. The children were barefoot and naked. My wife's pants were so torn that her thighs were exposed, and she couldn't wear a complete piece of clothing all year round. The landlord pressed for rent every day, that kind of life was unbearable. Now, there is no problem with food at home, and my wife and children can wear new clothes. This is called turning over a new leaf, and I will never forget the goodness of the Communist Party."
    Speaking of Li Ming, the loaders and unloaders gnashed their teeth, and everyone could endlessly recount his crimes: colluding with Japanese puppet police and the KMT secret agents, privately setting up courts, binding and beating workers, pouring cold water on them, pressing them with levers, cutting off their ears, using dogs to bite them, using red-hot iron rods to burn them, soaking them in cold water in winter, burying them in the snow... These were all things that the workers had suffered or witnessed themselves.
    Man Dengke, who had worked as a porter for fifteen years, told the reporter about how he and his family were framed and beaten by Li Ming: One night at about 9:00 during the Japanese occupation, I finished work and went home, and I saw Li Ming's older brother, Li Zhe, stealing a dozen bags of foreign flour from the warehouse. The next day, Li Ming went to the puppet police station and claimed that I had stolen the flour, and he insisted on detaining me and my father. Because I said it was Li Zhe who stole it, Li Ming held a grudge and said to me, "Be careful, we'll meet again!" Sure enough, three days later, Li Ming sent his henchmen to take me to the porter's dormitory with a pistol, tied me up, and beat me with bamboo poles. When my mother heard about it, she ran to kowtow to Li Ming and beg for mercy, but instead, she was slapped twice. Five or six days later, my fourth brother, Man Dengsheng, was also tied up and beaten by Li Ming, and then sent to the Northeast, where he has not been heard from to this day. My father went to beg for mercy and was kicked twice. A few days later, my third brother, Man Dengjun, was also tied up and thrown into a cold water tank in the middle of winter, and then sent to Hokkaido, Japan, to work as a forced laborer. He only returned after the Japanese surrendered.
    During the Japanese occupation, Li Ming worshiped Inuzuka, the manager of "International Company," as his godfather, relying on his power to collude with enemy police and puppet police, oppressing workers. When the Kuomintang came, he bribed the "takeover officials" and became sworn brothers with secret agents. For more than a decade, he had been dominating outside Guang'anmen, nicknamed "Living閻王." He raised more than 30 henchmen and thugs, and when he went out, he had bodyguards holding iron rods to protect him. More than a thousand loaders and unloaders made a living under him, and they could only eat two black bean cakes a day. No one knew how much money they earned in a day, let alone dared to ask. They simply received what "master rewarded" at the time. During the KMT rule, Li Ming took a share of the money from the railway, and also split the accounts with the warehouse loaders and unloaders by four to six, and also took a share of the wages. He used the blood and sweat of the exploited workers to feed herds of chickens, ducks, pigs, and sheep, living a comfortable life.
    After liberation, Li Ming actually thought that the lenient policy of the People's Government was something to take advantage of, and he still did not work, but took a share of the money from both the Guang'anmen Station and the warehouse. By means of threats and inducements, he used his past henchmen to sneak into the Guang'anmen Station Loading and Unloading Trade Union and become the director. At this time, he threatened the workers, saying: "Want to turn over? Unless you walk with your head on the ground and your feet holding the grain!" "Wolves eat meat all over the world, dogs eat shit all over the world, the head is always the head." At that time, the workers did not understand the policies of the People's Government, their awareness was not enough, and they were afraid of being beaten in the past. They were afraid that Li Ming would turn against them and they could not bear it, so they did not dare to tell the cadres sent by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to organize the workers. The trade union staff first carried out enlightenment education among the workers, held mass meetings, and selected representatives to go to the Federation of Trade Unions training class to study. Then, they mobilized activists to organize the trade union, and the trade union organized the workers to work, and announced the total amount of wages earned together on the same day, and distributed the wages fairly according to the weight of the work. The trade union director also worked the same way. The trade union improved the work at any time according to the correct opinions of the workers. After a period of time, the workers' awareness improved day by day. After the Municipal Public Security Bureau disbanded the "Lobbying" organization and arrested Han Qingkai, the head of the "Lobbying" organization in the East Station, the trade union immediately mobilized the workers to expose Li Ming's crimes. Although Li Ming arranged for his henchmen to make trouble and hold back, they did not succeed. Finally, the awakened workers finally shouted the slogan "Blood debt must be paid in blood" and boldly accused him. The trade union received 22 indictments in one day. Based on the workers' accusations, the Public Security Bureau arrested Li Ming, the extremely wicked "Lobbying" boss, on April 8.
    The workers worked happily, and everyone talked about this event excitedly, saying, "The current government is really the people's government." Shu Jingsheng, the director of the Loading and Unloading Trade Union, talked about the comparison between the workers' work before and after liberation: Before, when working under Li Ming, the workers were not full, so they were thinking about stealing; grain spilled on the ground and covered their feet, and no one cared if it rotted; after it rained in summer, the smell of rotten grain could be smelled two or three *li* around the warehouse. Now, the workers have all realized that the grain belongs to the people, and it is really not easy for the peasant brothers to harvest the grain and send it to the warehouse, so they all automatically take responsibility for protecting the grain, and there are very few spilled grains on the ground. Now, a team of workers can unload two to three trains of grain a day, and the work efficiency is more than twice as high as before. The small "Lobbying Bosses" also honestly work with the workers.

### 由黑夜到天明  访问广安门外仓库装卸工人

　　由黑夜到天明
    访问广安门外仓库装卸工人
    本报记者  冯仲
    北京广安门外各仓库的装卸工人，斗倒了“搂包”头子李明之后，工人们欢喜若狂。他们在自己的工会领导之下，开始了新的自由愉快的生活。现在每个工人平均每天能得到十一、二斤白面的工资。合作社、食堂也办起来了，工人们的生活已得到很大的改善，并且都进入了夜校开始学习文化。工人曾广德谈到他们的生活说：“没有人剥削我们，压迫我们，挣多少，得多少，生活过得好多了。我们每人都做了新制服，道远的还买了自行车。”工人陈璧元家里共有四口人——老婆和两个孩子。他把过去和现在的生活作比较说：“以前在李明手下干活，整天连窝头咸菜都混不上，吃了早晨的没晚上的。孩子光着屁股赤着脚。老婆的裤子破得露着大腿，成年穿不上一件完整的衣裳。房东天天催房钱，那份日子就甭提了。现在，家里吃的不成问题，老婆孩子可以穿新衣裳了，这可叫翻了身，一辈子也忘不了共产党的好处。”
    提起李明，装卸工人们个个咬牙切齿，每个人都可以滔滔不绝地诉说一套他的罪行：勾结日伪警宪和国民党特务，私设公堂，对工人捆打，灌凉水，压杠子，剪耳朵，洋狗咬，用烧红铁通条烙，冬天用凉水泡，往雪里埋……这些都是工人们受过或亲眼见过的。
    干了十五年脚行的满登科对记者谈起他自己和家人被李明陷害吊打的经过：日寇统治时期的一天夜里九点多钟，我干完活回家，看见李明的哥哥李浙偷了库房的十几袋洋面。第二天，李明到伪警务段反说我偷了面，硬把我和我父亲扣押起来。因为我说出来是李浙偷的，李明就怀恨上了，对我说：“小心点，后会有期！”果然，三天后李明派爪牙拿手枪将我捉到脚行宿舍，捆起来用竹杆抽打。我母亲听到后跑来给李明磕头央告，反被打了两个嘴巴。过了五、六天，我四弟满登升又被李明捆去殴打，以后弄到东北去，至今没有下落。我父亲曾去求饶，也被踢了两脚。不几天，三弟满登钧又被捆走，三九天被扔进凉水缸里泡着，以后被发到日本北海道做苦工，日寇投降才回来。
    在日寇统治时期，李明曾拜“国际公司”经理犬冢为干爹，仗势勾结敌宪伪警，欺压工人。国民党来了，又贿买“接收大员”，和特务拜把兄弟，十几年来一直称霸于广安门外，绰号“活阎王”。他饲养爪牙打手三十多人，出门有保镖的手拿铁棍卫护着。一千多个装卸工人就在他手下讨生活，每天只能吃到两顿黑豆面饼子。谁也不知道一天挣多少钱，更不敢问，到时候“随爷赏”。国民党统治时期，李明在铁路上拿一份钱，还和仓库装卸工人四六分账，另外还要分一份工资。他用剥削工人的血汗钱，喂养着成群的鸡、鸭、猪、羊，过着舒适的生活。
    解放以后，李明竟认为人民政府的宽大政策为可欺，仍然不劳动，在广安门车站和仓库各拿一份钱。他以威胁利诱手段，利用过去的爪牙，混进广安门车站装卸工会当了主任。这时，他又威吓工人说：“想翻身？除非头顶着地用脚顶着粮食走！”“狼走遍天下吃肉，狗走遍天下吃屎，头终久是个头。”当时工人不明白人民政府的政策，觉悟也不够，过去又被打怕了，唯恐李明翻过手来受不了，有话也不敢对市总工会派来组织工人的干部说。工会工作人员便首先在工人中进行启发教育，开群众大会，选派代表去总工会训练班学习。然后发动积极分子组织起工会，由工会组织工人做工，当天公布共同挣得的工资数目，按做工轻、重，公平分配工资。工会主任也一样干活。工会随时根据工人的正确意见，改善工作。这样经过一个时期，工人的觉悟一天天提高了。在市公安局解散“搂包”组织，逮捕东站“搂包”头子韩清凯等以后，工会立即发动工人揭露李明的罪恶。虽然李明布置了爪牙捣乱扯腿，但都未成。最后觉悟了的工人终于喊出“血债血还”的口号，大胆控诉。工会一天就接到二十二件控诉状。根据工人的控诉，公安局在四月八日逮捕了罪大恶极的“搂包”头子李明。
    工人兴高采烈地干着活，每一个人谈到这件事都兴奋地说：“现在的政府真是人民的政府了。”装卸工会主任舒景生讲说了解放前后工人干活情形的对比：以前在李明手下干活，工人吃不饱，就惦记着偷；粮食洒在地上没脚面，腐烂了谁也不去管；夏天下过雨，仓库周围两三里地都可闻到烂粮食的臭味。现在，工人都认清了粮食是人民的，农民兄弟打下粮食送到仓库实在不易，所以都自动负责保护粮食，地上已经很少看到洒下的粮粒了。现在，一班工人一天可以卸两火车至三火车粮食，工作效率比以前提高一倍多。小“搂包”也老老实实地和工人一起干活了。
