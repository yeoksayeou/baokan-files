　　Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 26th: The Qingdao private Guangda Chemical Factory has successfully created tannic acid and has begun large-scale production. Currently, the factory can produce 15 to 20 tons of tannic acid per month. In order to protect this industry which benefits the national economy and the people's livelihood, the Qingdao Foreign Trade Administration Branch has obtained approval from the Ministry of Trade of the Central People's Government to temporarily suspend the import of tannic acid in Qingdao. The cost of tannic acid produced by the factory is only 15,000 yuan per pound, which is 5,000 yuan lower than that of American products. Although its tannin content is slightly lower than that of American products, the residue is less than that of American products. The factory is currently continuing to study how to improve quality and expand production. Tannic acid is an important mordant for dyeing and printing, and it is also an important material for tanning, papermaking, photography, ink making, and polishing agents, with a wide range of uses. According to statistics, the monthly consumption in Qingdao alone is more than 10 tons. In the past, because our country could not produce it ourselves, we exported large quantities of the main raw material for manufacturing tannic acid, gallnuts, at low prices, and then imported tannic acid from foreign countries at high prices.

　　青岛私营广大化学厂创制单宁酸成功
    贸易部批准暂停单宁酸在青岛进口，以保护此种工业。
    【新华社青岛二十六日电】青岛市私营广大化学厂创制单宁酸成功，并已开始大量制造。目前该厂每月可产单宁酸十五至二十吨。青岛国外贸易管理分局为保护此种有利于国计民生的工业，已请准中央人民政府贸易部，暂时停止单宁酸在青岛进口。该厂所制单宁酸每磅成本仅一万五千元，较美国货低五千元，其单宁含量虽稍次于美货，但渣滓却较美货为少。该厂现正继续研究如何提高质量，扩大生产。按单宁酸为一种重要的印染媒介剂，也是鞣革、造纸、照像、制墨水及磨光剂的重要材料，用途甚广。据统计，仅青岛市一地每月使用量即达十吨以上。过去我国因不能自制，以致将制造单宁酸的主要原料五倍子大量廉价输出，又自外国高价输入单宁酸。
