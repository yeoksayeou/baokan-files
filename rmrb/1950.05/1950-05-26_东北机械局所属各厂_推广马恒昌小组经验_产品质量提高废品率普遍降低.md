    Promote Ma Hengchang Team Experience
    Product Quality Improves, Scrap Rate Universally Decreases
    [Shenyang News] Northeast Daily News: Factories under the Northeast Mechanical Bureau are actively promoting the Ma Hengchang Team experience. According to incomplete statistics from April 20th, 231 production teams under the Bureau's affiliated factories have formulated production plans and achieved certain results, with scrap rates generally decreasing.
    Of the 116 production teams in the First Machine Factory, 48 have already made plans. The achievements of the Fifth Turning Team are the most significant. As of the 20th of last month, the team had completely eliminated scrap products and completed the entire month's task ten days ahead of schedule, creating a new record for improving quality in the factory. In the Fifth Machine Factory, an initial 13 production teams sparked a wave of learning, followed by 41 more teams formulating plans. For example, the Ninth Team of Workshop One previously did not study technology, resulting in a scrap rate of 10%. After learning from the Ma Hengchang Team experience and formulating a plan, they now inspect work before handover, study technology every day at noon, investigate the causes of scrap products, and promptly correct shortcomings in their work. The scrap rate has now dropped to 1%. The Third Machine Factory implemented team division of labor, and individuals also formulated plans, performing detailed self-checks during shift handovers to avoid waiting for inspectors. Team leaders frequently supervised and inspected those with high skills who were careless, as well as those with lower skills, to prevent scrap products in advance. As a result, among the 4,700+ pieces of six-foot boxcar parts produced by the Sixth Workshop, there was only one scrap product (compared to 11 scrap products among 3,000 pieces in March). The bed group of the Fourth Workshop created a work progress chart, using different symbols to record instances of no scrap products, scrap products, absenteeism, and violations of labor discipline, summarizing it weekly. This method greatly promoted worker enthusiasm. The group completed the entire month's task in 17 days, with completely qualified quality. In addition to formulating work plans, the teams in each workshop of the Sixth Machine Factory also developed production progress charts and responsibility assignment charts. For example, the Third Turning Team, in order to change the past situation of incomplete systems, not only clarified the division of labor but also established a team leader inspection system and a shift handover system. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at noon, they spent 20 minutes studying technology, identifying the causes of good and bad work. Before morning study, they held a ten-minute review meeting to review the causes of scrap work and jointly research improvement methods. In addition, if a large number of scrap products were discovered, the team leader could convene a technical research meeting at any time to discuss improvement methods. As a result of implementing these methods, the team also completed the April task eight days ahead of schedule, and the scrap rate decreased from 4% last month to 1%. The steel ingot mold group of the Experimental Factory established a quality responsibility system; from April 1st to the 20th, the scrap rate decreased from 25% last month to slightly less than 1%. All teams in the Automobile General Factory are widely carrying out the study of the Ma Hengchang Team experience, achieving initial results. For example, the scrap rate of cylinder blocks in the grinding team in March was 22%, which has decreased to 14.4% in April. Thirty-three teams in the Tool Factory also launched a wave of enthusiasm for formulating plans. After the Grinding Wheel Factory learned from the Ma Hengchang Team experience, the scrap rate of the pressing team decreased from 4% in March to slightly more than 1%, and costs are gradually decreasing.

    推广马恒昌小组经验         
    产品质量提高废品率普遍降低
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：东北机械局所属各厂，纷纷推广马恒昌小组经验。据四月二十日不完全统计，全局所属各厂已有二百三十一个生产小组订了生产计划，并已作出一定成绩，废品率普遍降低。
    第一机器厂一百一十六个生产小组，已有四十八个作了计划。其中以车工五组成绩最显著。截至上月二十日止，该组废品已全部消灭，并提前十天完成全月任务，创造了该厂提高质量的新纪录。第五机器厂先有十三个生产小组掀起学习热潮，接着，又有四十一个小组作了计划。如该厂一所九组，过去不研究技术，废品率达到百分之十，自学习马恒昌小组经验，订出计划后，交活必须检查，每天午间研究技术，追究废品原因，及时纠正工作中的缺点，废品率已降至百分之一。第三机器厂实行了小组分工，个人也订出计划，在交接班时自己详细检查，避免了等待检查员检查的现象。组长对技术高而好马虎的人，及技术低的人，经常督促检查，预先防止产生废品。结果，第六工作部所制之六英尺闷罐车床四千七百多件中，只有一件废品（三月份三千件中即有十一件废品）。该厂第四工作部床身小组，绘制一工作进度表，对没废品、有废品、旷工及不守劳动纪律者，以不同符号，记入表内，每周总结一次。这种方法，对工人的积极性起了很大的推动作用。该组十七天完成了全月任务，质量并完全合格。第六机器厂各车间小组，除订出工作计划外，还制订了生产进度表和分工负责表。如车工三组，为了改变过去各种制度不健全的情况，除明确分工外，并订有组长检查制及交接班制。他们每周一、三、五午间，以二十分钟研究技术，找出好、坏活的原因；在早晨学习前，开十分钟检讨会，检讨废活原因，并共同研究改善办法。此外，发现废品多时，组长可随时召集技术研究会，讨论改进办法。由于实行了上面这些办法，该组亦提前八天完成四月份任务，废品率亦由上月百分之四降至百分之一。实验工厂钢锭模组建立质量责任制；四月份到二十日止，废品率已由上月百分之二十五减至百分之一弱。汽车总厂各小组普遍开展学习马恒昌小组经验，收到初步效果。如磨工班三月份汽缸本体废品率占百分之二十二，四月份已降至百分之十四点四。工具厂亦有三十三个小组掀起订计划热潮。砂轮厂学习马恒昌组经验后，压榨班的废品由三月份的百分之四降至百分之一强，成本亦逐渐降低。
