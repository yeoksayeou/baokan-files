　　Letter from the Author of "New Terminology Dictionary": Accepting Criticism from Readers and Reworking the Revised Edition
　　To the Esteemed Editor:

　　I have read successively the criticisms of the "New Terminology Dictionary" by comrades Changfeng and Wangcheng in the inaugural issue of "Book Review" in the People's Daily on April 5, and the criticisms by comrades Zhang Jing and Feng Benhua in the "People's Garden" on April 22 regarding the explanation of the "surtax" entry in the "New Terminology Dictionary," as well as the opinions of the State Taxation Administration of the Ministry of Finance. These criticisms and opinions undoubtedly urge us to improve. We not only sincerely accept them, but they also provide a great warning and encouragement to our ongoing revision work. I will strive to examine the errors and shortcomings of the entire book and carefully correct and supplement them.

　　Hu Jitao

　　《新名词辞典》作者来信
     接受本报读者批评重新进行增订工作编辑同志：
    先后见到人民日报四月五日《图书评论》创刊号上长风、王城两同志《评几本辞典》中对《新名词辞典》的批评，同月二十二日《人民园地》上张竞、封本化两同志对《新名词辞典》中“附加税”一条解释的批评及财政部税务总局的意见。这些批评和意见，无疑地都是督促我们进步的，我们除诚意地表示接受外，并使我们正在着手的增订工作，得到一种很大的警惕和鼓励，我当努力检查全书的错误和缺点，审慎地加以订正、增补。
    胡济涛
