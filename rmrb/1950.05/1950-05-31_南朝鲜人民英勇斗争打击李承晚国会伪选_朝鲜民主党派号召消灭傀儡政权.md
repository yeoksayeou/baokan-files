Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 30th: Under the call of the Korean Workers' Party and the Korean Democratic Front for National Reunification, the South Korean people are widely launching a heroic struggle to strike against the rigged South Korean National Assembly election directed by American imperialism and its aggressive tool, the "United Nations Commission on Korea," scheduled for May 30th.

According to the South Korean Labor News, on the eve of the election, the Syngman Rhee bandit gang mobilized a large number of puppet police and secret agents, setting up "extraordinary alert networks" in various places, creating an atmosphere of terror, and forcing people to participate in the rigged election. However, the broad masses of people in cities and villages, in coordination with the activities of the guerrillas, are carrying out unwavering resistance in various ways, such as breaking through the alert networks, attacking "election offices," holding mass rallies, and refusing to accept "voter registration cards." While launching widespread attacks, the guerrillas distributed hundreds of thousands of leaflets calling on the people to resist the rigged election. In mid-May, the guerrillas successively attacked Hamyang, Sancheong, and Ulsan in Gyeongsangnam-do; Gyeongju and Chungju in Gyeongsangbuk-do; Daedeok in Chungcheongnam-do; and Jeongeup in Jeollabuk-do. After executing the secret agents of the "election offices," they turned the "voter meeting places" into venues for village meetings, carrying out propaganda and mobilization work. On May 12, the "election office" in Busan's Eul district was destroyed by patriotic youth in the city, and the reactionary "candidates" were liquidated.

Xinhua News Agency, May 30th: TASS, Pyongyang: As the reactionary "National Assembly" of South Korea is scheduled to hold a so-called "election" on May 30th, democratic parties and people's organizations in Korea have issued a letter to the South Korean people, calling on them to resist this illegal election and strengthen the struggle to expel the United Nations Commission on Korea, eliminate the Syngman Rhee puppet government, and achieve the peaceful reunification of the country. The Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party pointed out in a letter to South Korean party members: "Under the leadership of our party, the Korean people successfully resisted the first divisive election on May 10, 1948." The letter called on them to "more boldly launch a struggle to resist the illegal election in South Korea, and expose the anti-national nature of the so-called election held by the Syngman Rhee clique, which is only interested in profit."

The Korean Democratic Front for National Reunification, the Democratic Independence Party, the People's Republican Party, the South Korean Farmers' Alliance, the Women's Alliance, and all other patriotic parties and people's organizations in South Korea have issued similar statements.

    【新华社平壤三十日电】在朝鲜劳动党、朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线的号召下，南朝鲜人民广泛展开英勇斗争，打击美帝国主义及其侵略工具“联合国朝鲜委员会”所导演的定于五月三十日举行的南朝鲜国会伪选。
    据南朝鲜劳动力者报报道：在选举前夕，李承晚匪帮动员大批伪军警和特务，在各地布置了“非常警戒网”，造成恐怖的气氛，强迫人民参加伪选。但城市与农村中的广大人民配合游击队的活动，正以突破警戒网、袭击“选举办公处”，召开群众大会、拒绝接受“选民证”等各种方式进行着不屈不挠的抗争。游击队在广泛出击时，散发了数以十万计的号召人民抵制伪选的传单。在五月中旬，游击队先后袭击了庆尚南道的咸阳、山清、蔚山，庆尚北道的庆州、忠州，忠清南道的大德，全罗北道的井邑等地区。他们在处决了“选举办公处”的特务分子后，即将“选民会议场”变成村民大会的会场，进行宣传鼓动工作。五月十二日釜山市乙区的“选举办公处”，被市内的爱国青年捣毁，并清算了反动派的“候选人”。
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社平壤讯：在南朝鲜反动“国民议会”订于五月三十日举行所谓“选举”之际，朝鲜的民主党派与人民团体发表了告南朝鲜人民书，号召抵制此次非法选举，并加强为驱逐联合国朝鲜委员会，为消灭李承晚的傀儡政府，并为国家的和平统一而斗争。朝鲜劳动党中央委员会在告南朝鲜党员书中指出：“在我党的领导之下，朝鲜人民曾于一九四八年五月十日胜利地抵制过第一次的分裂选举。”该书号召他们“更大胆地在南朝鲜发起抵制非法选举的斗争，揭露唯利是图的李承晚集团举行的所谓选举的反民族性质。”
    朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线、民主独立党、人民共和党、南朝鲜农民同盟、妇女同盟和南朝鲜一切其他的爱国党派与人民团体，都发表了类似的声明。
