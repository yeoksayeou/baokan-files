Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 19th: The Council of Ministers of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea decided on May 15th to issue public bonds for the development and construction of the people's economy. The issuance date of the bonds is October 1st of this year, with a total issuance of 1.5 billion won (Korean currency) and a term of ten years. Half of the total issuance will be repaid by lottery within ten years, and the remainder will be repurchased by the government at the original price upon maturity. All income from the bonds is exempt from national and local taxes.

    After the news of the bond issuance was released, people from all walks of life in Korea immediately launched a wave of subscriptions. In just two days, from May 15th to 17th, the Korean people had subscribed for 1.81 billion won, exceeding the issuance amount by 310 million won.

    In his radio address on May 15th, Choi Chang-ik, Minister of Finance of the Republic, pointed out: The issuance of this public bond is not only to further develop the national economy and improve the people's material and cultural life, but also an important measure and necessary preparation to promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland. This is a productive, constructive bond that benefits the people, which is fundamentally different from the 10 billion "national debt" issued by the Lee Seung-man gang to exploit the people and attempt to turn South Korea into a colony of American imperialism. This is the basic reason why the people of North Korea, even before the bonds were issued, held mass rallies everywhere and launched a wave of subscriptions, while the so-called "national debt" issued by Lee Seung-man was declared a "failure" under the fierce opposition of the people of South Korea.

　　朝鲜发行建设公债
　　两天认购超过定额
    【新华社平壤十九日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国部长会议于五月十五日决定发售人民经济发展建设公债。公债发行日期为今年十月一日，发行总额为十五亿元（朝币），期限十年。发行总额的一半在十年内抽签偿还，其余则于期满后，由政府以原价收购，公债的一切收入免征国家及地方捐税。
    公债发售消息传出后，朝鲜各界人民立即掀起认购的热潮。仅在十五日至十七日的两天内，朝鲜人民已认购了十八亿一千万元，超过发行额三亿一千万元。
    共和国政府财政部长崔昌益十五日在其广播演说中指出：这次公债的发行，不仅是为进一步发展国民经济、提高人民的物质文在生活，而且是促进祖国和平统一的重要措施和必要准备。这是生产的、建设的、为人民谋福利的公债，它与李承晚匪帮为压榨人民，企图变南朝鲜为美国帝国主义殖民地而滥发的一百亿“国债”，有着根本的区别。这就是为什么北朝鲜人民，还不等公债发行，就到处召开群众大会，掀起认购热潮，而李承晚发行的所谓“国债”，却在南朝鲜人民的猛烈反对下宣告“失败”的基本原因。
