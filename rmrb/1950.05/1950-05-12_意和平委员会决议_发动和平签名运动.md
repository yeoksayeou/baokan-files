　　Italian Peace Committee Resolution
　　Launches Peace Signature Campaign
    [Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 10th] Tass, Rome: The Italian Peace Committee held a national conference in Rome on the 5th and 6th. Representatives from 64 local peace committees participated. Nenni served as chairman. The conference decided to launch a signature campaign throughout the country in support of the World Peace Congress Standing Committee's appeal to ban atomic weapons.
    In his opening report, Nenni emphasized the seriousness of the war crisis and the need to attract a wider range of Italian people from all walks of life to participate in the struggle against this crisis. Nenni said that the most serious mistake that peace defenders must correct is, first of all, underestimating the crisis of war, and on the other hand, holding the view that war is inevitable.
    Based on the resolution of the conference, the secretariat of the conference has issued practical instructions to local peace committees to organize and carry out the signature campaign in support of the peace appeal.

　　意和平委员会决议
　　发动和平签名运动
    【新华社十日讯】塔斯社罗马讯：意大利和平委员会于五、六两日在罗马举行全国会议，共有六十四个地方和平委员会的代表参加，由南尼任主席。大会决定在全国发动拥护世界和大常委会禁用原子武器呼吁书的签名运动。
    南尼在开幕时作报告，强调指出战争危机的严重，必须吸引更加广大的意大利各阶层人民，参加为反对这种危机而进行的斗争。南尼说：和平保卫者必须纠正的最严重的错误，首先便是一方面把战争的危机估计过低，一方面又抱着战争不可避免的观念。
    大会秘书处根据大会的决议，已向各地和平委员会发出实际指示，以组织和进行拥护和平呼吁书的签名运动。
