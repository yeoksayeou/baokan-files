　　Gold Rush
    Li Min
    It is already early summer, but the mountain tops in the southeastern Qinghai Province are still covered in white snow. The gold mining team of the Eighth Company of the Sixth Regiment of a certain unit of the Qinghai Military Region is diligently panning for gold in a small red dirt gully at the foot of these snow-covered mountains, braving the biting cold wind. The soldiers participating in the gold mining have all set plans, determined to be selfless and ensure that every bit of the fruits of their labor goes to the public.
    Every day, as soon as the sun rises over the mountains, the gold mining team carries their guns, hoes, and baskets, climbs over the small earthen hills, and heads towards the gold mining gully. After a half-hour of cultural study in groups, everyone takes off their cotton coats, goes down into the gully, and starts panning for gold. Deputy Battalion Commander Li Shixin and Company Commander Zhang Fucai, in cooperation with a local villager with many years of gold mining experience, investigated the distribution of gold sand, allocated manpower, and divided into digging, carrying, and washing groups for cooperation. The soldiers are working enthusiastically and actively to increase the wealth of the People's Motherland.
    After a few days, several holes more than seven feet deep appeared. Deputy Squad Leader Chen Zhong powerfully wielded his pickaxe, sweating profusely. When he found grayish-black black jade stone and snow-white "sheep brain" stone in the sand he dug out, he shouted excitedly, "Comrades, keep it up! The gold sand soil is here!" A cheer immediately rang out inside and outside the cave. The soldiers knelt in the mud in the cave, filling the baskets with gold sand soil, then carried the heavy baskets out of the cave, and quickly ran to the water trough, skillfully poured it down, and then ran back to the dirt cave with empty baskets.
    The water in the reservoir washed the gold sand soil in the water trough. After the gold sand soil was washed away, the water outlet was blocked, and then the accumulated inch-thick gold sand was shoveled into a small wooden trough and swayed left and right in the water. In this way, tiny, sparkling, golden grains of gold appeared in the small wooden trough. When the soldiers saw the fruits of their labor, they smiled happily. In the first twenty days of work, this small gold mining team panned out four taels and four fen of gold, which is equivalent to eighty-one *shi* of wheat. Now, the commanders and fighters of the gold mining team continue to work hard to increase the wealth of the country.

　　淘金记
    李敏
    已经是初夏季节，青海东南部山区的山顶上仍是一片白雪。青海军区某部六团八连的淘金队，就在这白雪皑皑的山脚下的一条小红土沟里，冒着刺骨的寒风，辛勤地淘金沙。参加淘金的战士们，纷纷订出计划，决心做到大公无私，做到劳动果实点滴归公。
    每天太阳刚一出山，淘金队就背着枪、扛着镢头、拿着筐子，爬过小土山，走向淘金沟。在分组进行半小时文化学习后，大家就脱下棉衣下沟去开始淘金。副营长李士信和连长张福才协同当地一个有多年淘金经验的老乡，调查了金沙分布情形，配备了劳动力，分成掏工、背土、洗金等组，分工合作。战士们为了增加人民祖国的财富，都热烈而积极地工作着。
    几天以后，一个个七尺多深的土洞就出现了。副班长陈中有力地挥舞着十字镐，热得浑身都是汗。当他在掏下的沙内发现了灰黑色的黑乌石和雪白的羊脑石时，欢喜得大嚷大叫：“同志们，加油呀！金沙土出来了！”洞内、洞外立刻响起了一片欢呼声。战士们跪在洞中的泥水里，把金沙土塞满了筐子，再背起沉甸甸的筐子钻出洞来，飞快地跑到水槽边，熟练地倒下后，又背着空筐子跑回土洞去。
    蓄水池里的水，冲洗着水槽里的金沙土。金沙土冲完了，就堵住水口，再用铲子把沉积下来的寸余厚的金沙铲到小木槽里，放在水中左右荡漾。这样，星星点点、金光灿烂的小金粒便出现在小木槽里。战士们看到了自己的劳动果实时，都高兴得笑起来了。这个小小的淘金队在最初二十天的工作中，淘出四两四分黄金，折合小麦可达八十一市石。现在，淘金队的指战员们继续在为增加国家的财富而努力地工作着。
