　　Political and Legal Committee Rewards Model Workers

[Our Dispatch] The Political and Legal Committee of the Central People's Government Administration Council held a conference on April 28th to reward thirteen model workers who emerged during the spring work campaign. At the meeting, their model deeds were explained, and they were awarded the works of Lenin and Chairman Mao, as well as other material prizes. The award recipients included cadres, service personnel, and technical personnel. One of them was Gao Xin, the section chief of the Administrative Section. He paid attention to studying his work and made a comprehensive calculation of all the telephones in the committee, proposing to reduce the original ninety-six telephones to sixty and reduce two switchboards to one. After the reduction of telephones, it not only did not affect the work, but also saved the public 1,600 catties of millet per month. He also promptly wrote the saving method into a document and introduced it to the various ministries and commissions under the Political and Legal Committee for adoption. Typist Teng Linge (a member of the Youth League) knew how to repair typewriters, but was initially unwilling to teach others. During the study movement, after hearing stories about Soviet technicians doing their best to help us with construction, his thinking was cleared, and he taught two comrades how to repair typewriters. At the meeting, he happily spoke about the process of his ideological transformation, earning enthusiastic applause from his comrades. Li Guoliang, an eighteen-year-old member of the Youth League, is the son of a poor peasant from Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, and joined the work force last October. During the conservation campaign, he proposed storing washbasin water to scrub the floor. This method was adopted by the leadership and can save half a ton of water per day, saving forty catties of millet per month. He had only attended school for one year, but through his own hard work and active participation in the cultural classes of the spare-time school, he can now recognize seven hundred characters. Therefore, he was also rewarded. (Shen Qidong)

　　政治法律委员会奖励模范工作者
    【本报讯】中央人民政府政务院政治法律委员会于四月二十八日举行大会，奖励了春季工作中涌现的十三名模范工作者。会上并讲解了他们的模范事迹，分别奖给列宁、毛主席的著作和其他物质奖品。被奖者包括干部、服务员和技术人员。其中之一是行政科科长高信。他注意钻研工作，将该会所有的电话机作通盘计算，提出将原有的九十六个电话机减为六十个，两部总机减去一个。裁减电话机之后，既不影响工作，而每月却给公家节约了小米一千六百斤的开支。他又及时地将节约办法写成材料，介绍给政法委会所属各部会采用。打字员滕麟阁（青年团员），他会修理打字机，起初不愿意教人；在学习运动中，他听了关于苏联技术人员尽力帮助我们建设的故事后，思想打通了，教会了两个同志修理打字机。他在大会上，愉快地讲自己的思想转变的过程，博得同志们热烈的鼓励的掌声。十八岁的青年团员李国良，是山西平遥县一个贫农的儿子，去年十月参加工作。在节约运动中，他提出储存洗脸水擦洗地板，这个办法被领导上采纳，每天可节约半吨水，每月可节约小米四十斤。他仅念过一年书，由于自己努力学习，并积极参加业余学校文化班学习，现在可以认七百字了。因此，他也得到了奖励。（沈其东）
