Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 5th: The industrial construction in Northeast China, which has only been in a peaceful construction environment for just over a year, has achieved brilliant accomplishments, pointing out a bright future for China's economic recovery and development. As of March this year, approximately 90% of the factories and mines that existed during the puppet Manchukuo period have resumed production. Currently, the situation of various basic industries in Northeast China is as follows: The iron and steel industry, which accounts for more than three-quarters of the country's output, has initially taken shape in its restoration work. This year, efforts will be made to gradually transform the imbalanced phenomena in the ironmaking, steelmaking, and steel rolling sectors left over from the puppet Manchukuo. The power generation capacity of the electrical industry has increased by one-third compared to the beginning of last year, basically meeting the electricity supply required by the increasing number of industrial and mining enterprises. The coal industry exceeded the original production plan by 24% last year. The average daily coal production efficiency per person in the entire territory has increased by 0.12 tons compared to the highest efficiency during the puppet Manchukuo period. Based on the tens of thousands of employees in Northeast China, an additional 4 million tons of coal can be produced annually. The chemical industry has increased its products from 20 in the first quarter of last year to more than 40 by the end of the year. The mechanical industry, which originally had a very weak foundation, has produced many machines required by industrial and mining enterprises since resuming work, and has also manufactured many machine tools for the mechanical industry itself, gradually creating conditions for independent operation. The emerging non-ferrous metal industry in Northeast China has restored mines and the Shenyang Smelting Plant several times more than at the beginning of the year last year. This year, it plans to continue prospecting seven mines and restore several ore dressing and smelting plants. The textile industry resumed production earlier, repairing 60,000 spindles and 1,500 looms last year. Compared with the first quarter of last year, the number of spindles in operation has increased by one-third, and the number of looms has more than doubled. Other industries such as pulp and papermaking and rubber industries also experienced significant development last year, creating huge profits for the country and becoming one of the sources of increased investment in heavy industry by the state.

The large-scale industrial recovery work in Northeast China has progressed rapidly in the year since the entire territory entered a peaceful environment. When the entire Northeast region was liberated in November 1948, very few enterprises could operate. By April of last year, half had started production. By September, this had increased to 65%, and by March of this year, it had reached approximately 90%. The number of workers increased by 240,000 in one year. Although the equipment of state-owned enterprises in Northeast China that has been restored is not as good as the level of the puppet Manchukuo, and many production departments have not yet restored even one-third of what they had during the puppet Manchukuo period, the production capacity using the same equipment conditions far exceeds the level of the puppet Manchukuo due to the increase in labor productivity of workers. For example, the ironmaking production capacity exceeds by 69%, and the textile industry production capacity exceeds by more than double. The number of miners at the Benxi Coal and Iron Company is half that of the puppet Manchukuo period, but the output is higher than during the puppet Manchukuo period.

The recovery and development of industry in Northeast China over the past year has brought about tremendous changes in the entire national economy of Northeast China, and the proportion of industry in the entire national economy has greatly increased. The total value of industrial production last year accounted for 35% of the total value of industrial and agricultural production. This year, the total value of industrial production is planned to increase by 93% compared to last year, thus the proportion of industry will increase to 43%. It is estimated that by 1952, the proportion of industrial production in Northeast China will likely exceed the highest level during the puppet Manchukuo period in 1943, when the industrial proportion accounted for 56% of the total value of industrial and agricultural production. Based on the fact that the manufacturing of means of production occupies a very large proportion in industrial production in Northeast China, it is highly possible to restore and strive to exceed the highest level of the puppet Manchukuo within three years. Last year, the value of products belonging to means of production accounted for 74% of the total value of state-owned industrial production in Northeast China. This year, the value of products belonging to means of production will account for 79% of the total value of industrial production in Northeast China. This cannot but greatly promote the speed of industrial construction.

　　为我国经济恢复与发展指出光明前途
    东北去年工业生产大增
    占工农业生产总值三分之一强
    【新华社沈阳五日电】在和平建设环境中仅及一年的东北工业建设，已获得了辉煌的成就，为我国经济的恢复和发展指出了光明的前途。截至今年三月为止，伪满时所有的厂矿已有百分之九十左右的数目恢复了生产。目前东北各项基本工业的情况是：产量占全国四分之三以上的钢铁工业，恢复工作现已初具规模，今年将为逐渐改造伪满遗留下来的制铁、炼钢、轧钢诸部门的不平衡现象而努力。电气工业现在的发电能力，比去年初增加了三分之一，基本上满足了逐日增加着的工矿业所需电力的供给。煤炭工业去年超过原定生产计划的百分之二十四。全境煤矿全年平均每人每天产煤能率已较伪满最高能率提高了零点一二吨。以东北上十万的员工计算，一年即可多产四百万吨煤。化学工业产品已由去年第一季度的二十种增加到年底的四十多种。原来基础极弱的机械工业，复工以来已生产了许多工矿企业所需的机器，并为机械工业本身制造了许多工作母机，逐渐地创造着独立经营的条件。东北新兴的有色金属工业去年中已恢复了多于年初数倍的矿山和沈阳冶炼厂，今年则准备继续探测七处矿山并恢复若干选矿和冶炼工厂。纺织工业生产恢复较早，去年修复了纺锭六万枚，织机一千五百台；与去年第一季相较，现在开动的纺锭增加三分之一，织机则增加一倍以上。其他如纸浆造纸工业、橡胶工业，去年也有很大发展，并为国家创造了巨额利润，成为国家对重工业增加投资的源泉之一。
    东北工业大规模的恢复工作，在全境转入和平环境的一年中，进展迅速。当一九四八年十一月东北全境解放之初，可以开工生产者为数极少；到去年四月，即有半数开始生产，至九月间，又增加到百分之六十五，今年三月则达到百分之九十左右。工人数量一年中则增加了二十四万人。虽然东北公营企业已恢复起来的设备尚不及伪满水平，许多生产部门已恢复的还不及伪满时的三分之一，但由于工人劳动生产率的提高，利用同样设备条件的生产能力却远远超过了伪满水平。如炼铁的生产能力即超过百分之六十九，纺织工业的生产能力超过一倍以上。本溪煤铁公司的矿山工人少于伪满时一半，但产量却比伪满时为多。
    一年来东北工业的恢复发展，已对东北整个国民经济发生了巨大的变化，工业在整个国民经济中的比重已大为提高。去年一年工业生产总值已占到工农业生产总值的百分之三十五；今年工业生产总值计划较去年提高百分之九十三，这样，工业比重将提高到百分之四十三。预计到一九五二年，东北工业生产的比重，将可能超过一九四三年的伪满时期最高水平，当时工业比重占工农业生产总值的百分之五十六。根据东北工业生产中生产资料的制造占有极大比重这一事实，三年内恢复并争取超过伪满最高水平是有极大可能的。去年东北国营工业的生产总值中，属于生产资料的产品价值占百分之七十四；今年东北工业生产总值中属于生产资料的产品价值将占百分之七十九；这就不能不大大促进工业建设的速度。
