　　Northeast Military Region's Agricultural Production Troops
　　Plant 350,000 Mu This Year   
    Strive to Obtain 45,000 Tons of Grain Including Other Production
    [Our Shenyang Dispatch] The troops of the Northeast Military Region participating in agricultural production have generally started cultivation after completing spring plowing preparations, and various sideline productions have also made preliminary achievements. This year, approximately 24,000 soldiers in the Northeast Military Region are participating in agricultural production, planning to cultivate 72,600 mu of paddy fields (including about one-fifth of virgin land), 279,745 mu of dry land, and more than 5,300 mu of vegetable gardens. In addition, the troops cultivating paddy fields organized engineering teams before the spring plowing to dig and repair main and branch canals, flood control dikes, and other projects. For example, six units, including a certain division participating in rice field agricultural production in Panshan, organized more than 8,400 people and completed one-half of the estimated total earthwork volume in two weeks, totaling approximately 869,618 cubic meters.
    Since the first production conference of the military region in January this year, the production committees of various troops, under the leadership of the Party committees at their respective levels, have actively carried out various preparations for agricultural and sideline production based on the task of self-sufficiency in food for three months (most troops also increased the task of self-sufficiency in vegetables for more than half a year), and selected capable cadres to take specific responsibility. In the past two months, with the assistance of the local people's governments and masses, and the active efforts of all comrades in the participating production troops, major preparations such as building and opening canals, purchasing fertilizers, seeds, farm tools, provisions, transportation, and organizing labor, livestock, and vehicles have been completed for spring plowing and sowing. According to preliminary and incomplete statistics: the troops have built more than 530 thatched houses near the production sites, opened more than 94 million cubic meters of canals, organized more than 4,700 mules and horses, 20 cattle, more than 1,200 carts, 14 trucks, transported more than 37 million catties of provisions, seeds, and farm tools, purchased more than 2.4 million catties of fertilizer powder, more than 400,000 catties of bean cake, accumulated more than 13 million catties of fertilizer, and purchased more than 1.2 million catties of rice seeds, and more than 4.5 million catties of seeds such as sorghum, soybeans, barley, and wheat. Cultivation and canal repair tools such as plows, harrows, shovels, hoes, sickles, soil baskets, and grass ropes are all prepared extremely fully and carefully. A certain division producing in the Panshan Farm in Liaoxi Province and the Helong District Farm in Liaodong Province has cultivated more than 4,800 mu of paddy fields and has begun planting dry land. A certain division cultivating dry land in northern Manchuria has sown more than 6,500 mu of barley, corn, and other crops after completing the task of rushing fertilizer delivery.
            Participating in Various Construction Projects for Industry, Mines, and Transportation
    The sideline production of the troops is to participate in various construction projects for national industry, mines, and transportation with their own labor force, and to carry out aquatic product processing, repair brick and tile kilns, set up supply and marketing cooperatives and small iron factories, open tofu shops, flour mills, and raise pigs according to local conditions. After signing a contract with the suburban office of Shenyang to repair the river excavation project in the Hun River irrigation area, a certain unit stationed in Shenyang completed 93,000 cubic meters of earthwork in twenty days with 2,500 people, and can obtain 3.8 billion Northeast currency in wages. After the completion of this project, it can provide irrigation for 60,000 mu of rice fields in the Hun River irrigation area, which can increase the rice fields of farmers in the area by 15,000 mu. After completing the repair of 198 dormitories of the local Mining Bureau, a certain unit stationed in Fushun obtained more than 4.29 billion yuan in wages. On the 6th of last month, another 700 people were organized to start the construction of the Shenyang-Fushun highway, planning to complete 37,600 meters of engineering in six months (including the construction of three new bridges, the repair of two bridges, the opening of 600 meters of mountains, and the opening of a river). After completion, more than 10 billion yuan in wages can be obtained. A certain unit in Changchun has signed a contract with the Northeast Highway Bureau to participate in the earthwork and stone crushing project for the construction of the Shenyang-Pulandian highway with more than 3,000 people, which is expected to be completed in three months. After completion, more than 20 billion yuan in wages can be obtained. Each regiment of a certain unit stationed in Shenyang has earned nearly 1 billion yuan in wages by selling small labor services such as loading and unloading trains in nearby factories. The Second Company not only bought horses to supplement agricultural production livestock from the wages earned from loading and unloading vehicles, but also solved many cultural learning supplies. Another unit organized an engineering team of more than 400 people to repair 860 meters of urban sewers in Shenyang, which started on April 22 and is expected to be completed in two months. After completion, 600 million yuan in wages can be obtained. Four units, including a certain unit stationed in Andong, Jinxi, and Yingkou, have all carried out aquatic product processing and production.
            Leaders Personally Go to Farms to Study Production Technology
    In the various preparation works for agricultural production, the leaders of various troops personally went to the farms to investigate and study production technology. Ding Shan, deputy director of a certain unit, personally spent three days researching the problems of rice transplanting and sowing with local farmers. Zhao Guotai, the division commander of another unit, personally invited several old farmers to discuss rice planting experience at the farm. Most troops, in the preparation work, have followed the method of training cadres first and then training soldiers, and have successively opened small short-term training classes for learning production technology before cultivation. Individual troops have even held two sessions in a row.
    Various troops have carried out production education before entering the site. In the production preparation work, many cadres have set an example by actively participating in labor, and Party members and League members have taken the lead everywhere. Striving to join the Party and the League in labor has become a common wish of non-Party comrades. The Third Company of the farm of a certain division has created many outstanding achievements in the various preparation works for labor production. It has completed the task of rushing transportation of more than 2.5 million catties in three weeks, and has successively completed the arduous task of cutting 222,500 catties of reeds and firewood and repairing 3,163 cubic meters of canal embankments in a short period of ten days. The Third Company of a certain regiment did not have enough land to cultivate, so the soldiers carried soil and laid sand to create fertile land.
            Persist in Cultural Learning and Close Military-Civilian Relations
    In the tense labor, most units have seized the gaps in production and persisted in 30 minutes to one hour of cultural learning. The production troops of a certain unit in Panshan Farm also proposed to insist on learning one character every day during the urgent farming season.
    In the labor, the production troops, in the spirit of learning from the masses and helping the masses, have very close military-civilian relations. The farm of a certain unit and the local masses organized two labor exchange teams of more than 200 people, and contracts have been signed. In the preparation work for spring plowing, various troops often asked the masses for production technology, and the masses also sincerely taught the troops. Yang Shouren, a labor model from Jinban Village, Helong District, Andong County, Liaodong Province, automatically became the "rice field instructor" for the Second Company of a certain unit producing in the area. The Eleventh Company of a certain regiment of the Public Security Forces, in participating in factory handicraft labor production, held experience exchange meetings with the factory workers every night to learn from the workers. Liu Haiting, the deputy squad leader of the Fourth Squad, and soldier Cai Fengqi also created a new record of filing 116 nails per hour. These fully demonstrate the strong friendship between the military and the people.
    According to the recent instructions of the military region, in addition to drawing a certain number of people to participate in agricultural production as stipulated, the remaining troops must participate in industrial and mining construction for three months, and propose that all difficulties be solved from production. Now, all comrades in the army are engaged in agricultural and sideline production with high enthusiasm and unparalleled confidence, and are fighting heroically to complete the task of producing 45,000 tons of grain this year.

　　东北军区参加农业生产部队
　　今年种地三十五万亩   
    连其他生产争取获得四万五千吨粮食
    【本报沈阳讯】东北军区参加农业生产的部队，完成春耕准备工作后，已普遍开始耕作，各项副业生产亦已作出初步成绩。东北军区今年参加农业生产的部队约二万四千余人，计划耕种水田七万二千六百亩（约包括五分之一的生荒），旱田二十七万九千七百四十五亩，菜田五千三百余亩。另耕种水田的部队，于春耕前组织工程大队，挖修水道干线、支线、防潮堤等项工程。如参加盘山稻田农业生产的某师等六个单位，即组织了八千四百余人，于两周间完成预计总工程土量的二分之一，计约八十六万九千六百一十八立方米。
    自今年一月军区第一次生产会议后，各部队生产委员会即在各该级党委领导下，根据自给三个月的食粮任务（大部分部队并自己增加自给半年以上菜蔬的任务），积极进行农业及副业生产的各项准备工作，并选派得力干部具体负责。两月以来，在驻地人民政府、群众的协助下，及参加生产部队全体同志们的积极努力，春耕播种方面完成了修建、开渠、购买肥料、种籽、农具、给养、运输及组织劳动力、畜力、车辆等主要准备工作。据初步的不完全统计：各部队在生产现场附近已修好草房五百三十余间，开渠九千四百余万立方米，组织骡马四千七百余匹，牛二十头，大车一千二百余辆，卡车十四辆，装运给养、种籽、农具等三千七百余万斤，购买肥田粉二百四十余万斤，豆饼四十余万斤，积肥一千三百余万斤，购买稻种一百二十余万斤，高粱、大豆、大麦、小麦等种籽四百五十余万斤，耕种修渠用具如犁、耙、锹、?①、镰刀、土篮、草绳等都准备得极为充分细致。在辽西省盘山农场及辽东省合隆区农场生产的某师等，已耕好四千八百余亩水田，并已开始种旱田。在北满耕种旱田的某师，完成突击送粪任务后，已播种大麦、苞米等六千五百余亩。
            参加工矿交通各项修建事业
    各部队的副业生产是以自己的劳动力，参加国家工、矿、交通等各项修建事业，并根据驻地情况进行水产加工、修砖瓦窑、设供销性合作社及小型铁工厂、开豆腐房、粉房、养猪等。驻沈阳某部与市郊办事处订了包修浑河灌溉区挖河工程后，以二千五百人于二十天中完成了九万三千立方米土的任务，可获工资东北币三十八亿元。此工程完成后，可供浑河灌溉区六万亩稻田之灌溉，可使该区农民增加一万五千亩稻田。驻抚顺某部于完成包修驻地矿务局宿舍一九八间，获工资四十二亿九千余万元后，上月六日又组织七百人动工修筑沈（阳）、抚（顺）公路，计划于六个月时间内完成三万七千六百公尺工程（中间要新建桥梁三座，修补桥梁两座，开山六百公尺，开河一道）。完工后可获工资一百余亿元。长春某部已与东北公路总局订了合同以三千余人参加沈阳到普兰店公路建筑的土方及打石子工程，预计三个月完成，竣工后可获工资二百余亿。驻沈阳某部各团，都给驻地附近工厂装卸火车卖小工等已获工资近十亿元。二连从装卸车所得工资中，不但买了马匹补充农业生产畜力，还能解决了不少文化学习用品。另部组织了四百余人的工程队包修沈阳市区下水道八百六十余米，已于四月二十二日开工，预计两月完成。完成后可获工资六亿元。驻安东、锦西、营口等地某部等四个单位都进行了水产加工生产。
            首长亲到农场研究生产技术
    在农业生产的各项准备工作中，各部队首长都亲到农场调查研究生产技术，某部丁山副主任曾亲自以三天时间与当地农民研究水田插秧与播种问题。另部赵国泰师长在农场亲自邀请若干老农座谈种稻经验。多数部队在准备工作中都本着先训练干部后训练战士的办法，先后开办了耕种前的小型短期学习生产技术的训练班。个别部队并接连办了两期。
    各部队在进入现场前都进行了生产教育。在生产准备工作中，很多干部以身作则，积极参加劳动，党员、团员处处带头，生产情绪普遍高涨。争取在劳动中入党入团，已成了非党同志的普遍愿望。某师农场三连在劳动生产的各项准备工作中，创造了很多优越的成绩，曾在三周中完成装卸二百五十余万斤的突击运输任务，又曾在短促的十天中先后完成砍苇柴二十二万二千五百斤，修渠堤三一六三立方米的艰巨任务。某团三连地不够种，战士便挑土垫砂造良田。
            坚持文化学习密切军民关系
    各部队在紧张的劳动中，多数单位都抓紧生产空隙，坚持了三十分钟到一小时的文化学习。盘山农场某部生产部队并提出在紧急的农忙时期，坚持每天学一个字。
    生产部队在劳动中，本着学习群众，帮助群众的精神，军民关系都非常密切。某部农场和驻地群众组织了两次二百余人的换工队，都已订了合同。在进行春耕准备工作中，各部队经常向群众请教生产技术，群众也诚恳的教给部队。辽东省安东县合隆区金板村劳动模范杨守仁自动给在该地生产的某部二连当“水田指导员”。公安部队某团十一连在参加工厂手工业劳动生产中，每晚同该厂工友一起开交流经验的会，向工人学习。四班副班长刘海廷、战士蔡凤起两同志还创造了每小时锉一一六根钉的新纪录。这些都充分显现出军民一家的浓厚情谊。
    根据军区最近指示，各部队除按规定抽出一定数量人员参加农业生产外，其余部队均须参加三个月工矿建设，提出一切困难从生产中解决。现全军同志正以高度热忱与无比信心，分别从事农业及副业生产的劳动，为完成今年生产四万五千吨粮食的任务英勇奋斗。
