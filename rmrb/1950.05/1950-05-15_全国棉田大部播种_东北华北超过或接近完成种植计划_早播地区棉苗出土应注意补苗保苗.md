Most of the Country's Cotton Fields Have Been Sown
Northeast and North China Have Exceeded or Nearly Completed Planting Plans
Attention Should Be Paid to Replanting and Protecting Seedlings in Early-Sown Areas

[By Our Correspondent] In response to the call of the Central People's Government to ensure cotton self-sufficiency, the broad masses of farmers in cotton-producing areas across the country launched a widespread cotton planting campaign around the Grain Rain solar term, striving to complete the goal of planting 50 million mu of cotton. Currently, the cotton planting tasks in the Northeast, North China, and Northwest provinces have been exceeded or are close to completion. The provinces in the Yangtze River basin in the Central South and East China regions started later due to the later frost and longer growing season for crops, and are currently making a concentrated effort to sow cotton. According to the situation in various regions at the end of April, the Northeast region planted 4.17 million mu of cotton fields, exceeding the original plan by 26 percent, doubling the area compared to last year, and exceeding the highest total cotton planting area during the puppet Manchukuo period by 14 percent. Barring unexpected disasters, it is estimated that more than 55,700 tons of lint cotton can be harvested, which is sufficient to supply the state-owned yarn factories in the region. The plan to plant 18 million mu of cotton in the North China region has nearly been completed. Many special districts in Hebei Province, such as Handan, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, and Hengshui, have exceeded their plans. Statistics at the end of April showed that the province had planted more than 11.49 million mu of cotton fields, accounting for 95.8 percent of the original plan, and is working hard to strive for planting 13 million mu of cotton. In Pingyuan Province, only five special districts, including Anyang, Xinxiang, Hubei West, Puyang, and Liaocheng, had planted 3.15 million mu of cotton by the end of April, accounting for 92.7 percent of the original plan of 3.4 million mu for the five special districts. The entire province of Pingyuan is working hard to strive for planting 4.5 million mu of cotton. Shanxi Province began sowing in mid-April, and by the end of April, it had completed 80 percent of the original plan, with 1.76 million mu of cotton planted throughout the province. The province is full of confidence in completing the planting plan of 2.2 million mu of cotton. The Northwest region reported that it could not only complete the task of planting 3.88 million mu of cotton and producing 1.32 million dan of cotton, but also exceed it. Currently, cotton fields in the Guanzhong Plain area of Shaanxi have been widely sown. The six counties of Weinan, Lintong, Lantian, Huaxian, Tongguan, and Huayin have sown more than 550,000 mu of cotton fields, accounting for 90 percent of the original plan. Dali, Wugong, Chang'an, Ganxian, Sanyuan, and Xianyang counties have also completed all or most of their sowing; however, some cotton fields in the Weinan sub-district have experienced seedling shortages, and the province is leading the masses in replanting and protecting seedlings. In the Central South and East China regions, in addition to Jiangxi completing the planting of 270,000 mu of cotton, there have also been considerable achievements in Henan, Shandong, and other places. For example, Tongxu County in the Henan cotton area has planted more than 65,000 mu of cotton, exceeding the plan by 10,000 mu; Qixian County will complete the planting task of more than 156,700 mu, an increase of more than 40,000 mu of cotton fields compared to last year. The Lubei Special District of Shandong has completed 1 million mu, accounting for 70 percent of the original plan; the Qinghe Special District can complete 690,000 mu. The central and southern Shandong cotton-producing areas are also making a concentrated effort to plant. Looking at the above situation, most of the cotton-planting areas across the country can complete or exceed the cotton-planting tasks. Only a few areas, such as the two lakes in the Central South region and some areas in the provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang in the East China region, have more difficulties in cotton planting due to the poor working foundation in the vast new areas. However, since the frost season is late, now is a good time for cotton planting. Therefore, we should concentrate our efforts to complete the cotton-planting task. The above major achievements are primarily due to the attention paid by leaders at all levels. For example, the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government has listed cotton planting as one of the two major focuses of increased production of grain and cotton, and various regions have also regarded cotton planting as the top priority in current production. For example, Hebei and Shanxi in North China, as well as the Northwest and Northeast regions, have transferred all possible forces to invest in the cotton planting campaign. In particular, the Financial and Economic Committee of the State Council of the Central People's Government timely announced the grain and cotton price ratio policy in the newspaper, which dispelled farmers' concerns and clarified the situation, greatly stimulating the cotton farmers' enthusiasm for planting cotton. At the same time, the timely spring rain and the full preparations made in various regions last winter and this spring, such as autumn plowing, manure accumulation, replenishment of agricultural tools, and preparation of cotton seeds, were relatively sufficient. In terms of cotton seeds alone, Hebei Province adjusted about 30 million jin throughout the province, accounting for one-third of the sowing area; Pingyuan Province had more than 4 million jin of cotton seeds; the Northwest Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry shipped and loaned 26,400 dan of improved cotton seeds purchased on March 12 to various cotton areas; northern Jiangsu also loaned 110,800 dan of cotton seeds; other regions such as Central South and East China also had considerable amounts; the difficulty of cotton seed shortage has been basically resolved.

Currently, in areas with early sowing, cotton seedlings have already emerged. In areas with late sowing, attention should be paid to checking, replanting, and protecting seedlings after cotton buds emerge, and strictly preventing the occurrence of diseases and insect pests. We must recognize that cotton field sowing is only the first step in completing the task of increasing cotton production. Many arduous tasks still need to be carried out in the future to truly complete the task of increasing cotton production.

### 全国棉田大部播种　东北华北超过或接近完成种植计划　早播地区棉苗出土应注意补苗保苗

　　全国棉田大部播种
　　东北华北超过或接近完成种植计划
    早播地区棉苗出土应注意补苗保苗
    【本报讯】全国产棉区广大农民，为响应中央人民政府号召，保证棉花自给，在争取完成植棉五千万亩的目标下，于谷雨前后，普遍展开了植棉运动。现东北、华北、西北各省的植棉任务，现已超过或接近完成。中南、华东两区的长江流域各省，因降霜较迟，作物生长期较长，因而动手也晚，目前正在突击棉花播种。据四月底各地情况，东北区播种棉田达四百一十七万亩，超过原计划的百分之二十六，较去年增加一倍，超过伪满时代最高植棉总面积的百分之十四；如无意外灾害，预计可收皮棉五万五千七百余吨，足可供该区国营纱厂之用。华北区植棉一千八百万亩的计划，已接近完成。河北省不少专区如邯郸、石家庄、唐山、衡水等专区均已超过计划。四月底统计，该省棉田播种已达一千一百四十九万余亩，占原计划的百分之九十五点八。并正为争取植棉一千三百万亩而努力。平原省仅安阳、新乡、湖西、濮阳、聊城等五个专区，四月底统计已播种棉花三百一十五万亩，达该五个专区原计划三百四十万亩的百分之九十二点七。平原全省正为争取植棉四百五十万亩而努力。山西省四月中旬开始下种，四月底已完成原订计划百分之八十，全省已植棉达一百七十六万亩。该省对完成二百二十万亩植棉计划，满怀信心。西北区报告，全区植棉三百八十八万亩、产棉一百三十二万市担的任务，不但可以全部完成，而且可以超过。现陕西关中平原地区，棉田已普遍下种，渭南、临潼、蓝田、华县、潼关、华阴等六县棉田下种已达五十五万余亩，占原计划的百分之九十；大荔、武功、长安、干县、三原、咸阳等县亦有全部或大部下种；但渭南分区部分棉田发现缺苗现象，该省正领导群众进行补苗保苗工作。中南、华东两区，除江西完成植棉二十七万亩外，在河南、山东等地亦有不少成绩，如河南棉区通许县已植棉六万五千余亩，超过计划一万亩；杞县十五万六千七百余亩的植棉任务将全部完成，比去年增加棉田四万余亩。山东泺北专区已完成一百万亩，占原计划的百分之七十；清河专区可完成六十九万亩。鲁中南产棉区亦正突击植，综观以上情况，全国绝大部分植棉地区，均可完成或超过植棉任务，只有少数地区如中南区的两湖，华东区之苏、皖、浙等省部分地区，由于广大新区工作基础较差，植棉中困难尚多，但由于降霜期较晚，目前正是植棉的良好时机，故应集中全力为完成植棉任务而努力。以上重大成绩的取得，首先由于各级领导重视。如中央人民政府农业部把植棉列为粮棉两大增产重点之一，各地亦将植棉工作，当作当前生产首位工作，如华北之河北、山西以及西北、东北等地均将一切可能动员的力量抽调出来，全部投入植棉运动中。特别是中央人民政府政务院财经委员会，适时的在报上公布了粮棉比价政策，使农民解除顾虑摸清了底，大大发挥了棉农的植棉积极性。同时，春雨及时及各地区去冬今春进行了的充分准备工作，如秋耕积肥农具补充以及棉籽等的准备比较充分。仅棉籽一项，河北省全省调剂达三千万斤左右，占播种面积的三分之一；平原全省棉籽达四百余万斤；西北农林部三月十二日将收购之改良棉种二万六千四百市担，分运各棉区贷放；苏北亦贷放棉种十一万零八百市担；其他地区如中南、华东等亦复不少；棉籽缺乏的困难，基本解决。
    目前在播种早的地区，棉苗早已出土，播种晚的在棉芽出土后均应注意查苗补苗保苗工作，严防病虫害的发生，认识棉田播种仅是完成增产棉花的第一步，今后仍须进行许多艰巨工作，以达到增产棉花任务的确实完成。
