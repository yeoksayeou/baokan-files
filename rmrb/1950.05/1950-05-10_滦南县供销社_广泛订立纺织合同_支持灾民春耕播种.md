Luan Nan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative
　　Widely Signs Textile Contracts to Support Disaster Victims' Spring Planting
　　[Hebei News] In order to achieve close integration of agriculture and sideline occupations and vigorously support disaster victims' spring planting, the Luan Nan County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Tangshan Prefecture widely adopted the contract system in April and greatly developed the textile industry. Luan Nan County is a heavily affected disaster area, and the only major sideline income of the disaster victims is the textile industry (with 20,441 looms and 57,801 spinning wheels). In order to help disaster victims develop sideline production and vigorously support spring planting, the county supply and marketing cooperative, in collaboration with the prefectural supply and marketing cooperative, opened up sales channels to the Northeast and then signed a contract with the prefectural supply and marketing cooperative for 50,000 bolts of homespun cloth, with the prefectural cooperative supplying raw materials. With the support of the prefectural cooperative, the county, in late March, in conjunction with spring planting, launched and organized a mass contract signing campaign. First, the benefits of signing contracts were widely publicized. Then, through village-level organizations, the masses were mobilized to form groups freely based on their own textile capabilities. Each household first signed a contract with the group leader, each group then signed a contract with the representative (elected by the masses), and the representative then signed a unified contract with the district cooperative. The district cooperative grasped the three-level contracts and supplied raw materials through the county cooperative, delivering the cloth when due. The county cooperative calculated the cost at 21 jin of rice per bolt of cloth and one jin and two liang of foreign yarn, and 15 jin of millet per jin and a half of raw cotton, for a total cost of 36 jin of rice. Standard cloth was collected at 48 jin of rice, and the disaster victims could earn a net profit of 12 jin of rice. After extensive organization and mobilization throughout the county from late March to April 20th, 312 villages and 9,442 households organized 2,637 textile groups and signed contracts for 41,061 bolts of cloth, driving 6,722 looms and 18,253 spinning wheels. A total of 36,864 and a half jin of foreign yarn and 23,672 jin and nine liang of raw cotton were supplied. By April 20th, a total of 20,880 bolts of homespun cloth were collected, and the masses earned 656,996 jin of coarse grains, which greatly supported the disaster victims' spring planting.
　　Due to the development of the contract system, first of all, disaster victims without funds were organized and started production. For example, Beikou Village previously only had four looms in production. After signing the contract, 42 looms were activated, and 80 bolts of cloth were completed in three days, earning 880 jin of millet. Secondly, a large amount of manpower was saved. In the past, buying raw materials piecemeal and delivering cloth separately sometimes led to congestion that prevented delivery for three or four days. After signing the contract, one representative from the whole village could handle it, and the cooperative also saved a lot of procedures. Thirdly, the quality of the cloth has also improved. In the past, the county's cloth had 420 warp threads, but now it has increased to 480 to 500 threads. In particular, the phenomenon of adding water to increase weight has been eliminated. In short, the signing of the contract system not only integrated agriculture and sideline occupations, but also greatly developed the membership of the cooperative (developing 4,889 members) due to the publicity of cooperative policies and the implementation of the policy of a difference of two and a half jin of rice between members and non-members in supply and marketing. However, a serious deviation also occurred in the signing of contracts, such as failing to activate disaster victims' private capital and simply forming a supply and marketing relationship, resulting in a large amount of capital being tied up and unable to expand production. In order to correct this deviation, the county cooperative convened a meeting of directors of district cooperatives on April 20th and adopted the method of supplying raw materials through transactions. In order to avoid the shutdown of households with difficulties, village cooperatives were extensively organized within the scope of village contracts, and village cooperatives were used to systematically support households with difficulties in production.

　　滦南县供销社
    广泛订立纺织合同  支持灾民春耕播种
    【河北讯】为达到农、副业的紧密结合、大力支持灾民春耕播种，唐山专区滦南县供销社，在四月份广泛采用合同制，大量发展了纺织业。滦南县是重灾区，灾民的唯一大宗副业收入是纺织业（有织布机二万零四百四十一架、纺车五万七千八百零一辆）。该县供销社为扶助灾民发展副业生产、大力支持春耕播种，曾协同专区供销总社打通与东北的销路，随即和专区供销总社订立五万匹土布的合同，由总社供给原料。该县在总社支持下，于三月下旬结合春耕播种，发动与组织了群众性的订合同运动。首先广泛的宣传了订合同的好处，接着通过村级组织，发动群众根据自己的纺织能力，自由结组，各户先向组长订合同，各组再向代表（由群众选出）订合同，代表再到区社统一订，区社掌握三级合同，通过县社供给原料，到时交布。县社按一匹布一斤一两洋纱折成二十一斤米，一斤半皮棉折十五斤小米，成本共合三十六斤米，按四十八斤米收标准布，灾民可净赚十二斤米。经过广泛的组织发动全县从三月下旬到四月二十日，三百一十二个村庄，九千四百四十二户，组织起二千六百三十七个纺织小组，订合同布四万一千零六十一匹，带动起织布机子六千七百二十二架、纺车一万八千二百五十三辆，共计供给洋纱三万六千八百六十四斤半，皮棉二万三千六百七十二斤九两，在四月二十日共收土布二万零八百八十匹，群众收益粗粮六十五万六千九百九十六斤，大力支持了灾民春耕播种。
    由于合同制的开展，首先使没资金的组织灾民，也生产起来。如贝口村过去只有四架织布机生产，订合同后，活动起四十二架，三天就完成了八十匹布，收入小米八百八十斤。其次是节省出大批人力，过去零买原料、分散交布，有时拥挤的三、四天交不上布，订了合同后，全村有一个代表就能办妥，合作社也省很多手续。第三，布的质量也随着提高了。该县过去经布四百二十根头，现在增到四百八十根头至五百根头，特别是杜绝了使水掺假的现象。总之合同制的订立不仅使农副业结合起来，同时由于宣传了合作政策，执行了在供销当中社员与非社员相差二斤半米的方针，使社员也得到大量发展（发展四千八百八十九名）。但在订合同中，也产生过一个严重偏向，如未带动起灾民私资，单纯形成供销关系，结果把大批资金停顿起来，不能扩大生产。为纠正这一偏向，县社于四月二十日召开了各区社主任会议，通过以交易方式供给原料。为避免困难户停业，在各村合同范围内，大量组织村社，通过村社有计划的扶植困难户进行生产。（许彦章）
