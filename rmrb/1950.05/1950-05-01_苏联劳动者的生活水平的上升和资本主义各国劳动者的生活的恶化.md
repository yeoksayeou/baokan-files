　　The Rising Living Standards of Soviet Workers and the Deteriorating Living Standards of Workers in Capitalist Countries
    Qiprakov
    On this May Day, as the international proletariat reviews its strength, they turn their eyes with special love and pride to the Soviet Union – the first country in the world where socialism has triumphed.
    The Soviet state is a sanctuary for ordinary people all over the world, where everything is subordinated to the interests of the people, and everything is done for the benefit of the working people.
    The year since May Day 1949 has been a year of many new achievements for Soviet workers. It is a year of new victories for the Soviet social system and state system.
    The continuous and increasingly accelerated growth of the Soviet national economy is an immutable economic law of socialist society. Simultaneously with this, the continuous increase in the welfare of the workers is the fundamental difference between the Soviet state and all countries in the capitalist camp. The continuous improvement of workers' living standards is also related to the basic laws of economic development in the Soviet socialist state.
    The Soviet people are now looking back with satisfaction at the tremendous production achievements they have made. These tremendous production achievements have been achieved by people who work for themselves and for the benefit of the whole society, giving full play to their free and creative labor. The total output of Soviet industry after the war has increased by 20% or even more each year. As early as the end of 1949, the total industrial output of the Soviet Union had exceeded the pre-war (1940) output by 41%. New and advanced technologies are now being adopted in various enterprises to reduce workers' labor and increase labor productivity.
    The total agricultural output in 1949 exceeded the pre-war level of 1940. The abundance of products at the disposal of the workers is increasing.
    In Soviet society, the distribution of national income does not benefit the enrichment of those exploiting classes and their countless parasites, but rather benefits the improvement of the material conditions of workers and peasants and the expansion of socialist production in urban and rural areas.
    In 1949, the national income of the Soviet Union exceeded the pre-war level by 36%. This has made it possible to greatly improve the material conditions of workers, peasants, and intellectuals. The income per worker and staff member increased by 24% in 1949 compared to 1940, calculated at comparable prices. The income per farmer increased by more than 30%.
    Since December 1947, the Soviet Union has reduced the prices of daily necessities three times. As a result, the purchasing power of residents has increased, the real wages of workers and staff members have greatly increased, and the cost of purchasing industrial products for farmers has decreased. Three price reductions saved residents approximately 267 billion rubles in expenditures in one year.
    In the Soviet Union, residents can receive subsidies from the state, social insurance premiums for workers and staff members, pensions, free medical care, medical treatment in sanatoriums and resorts, subsidies for mothers with many children and single mothers, free technical education and improvement, scholarships, and various other expenses and preferential treatment. The state also pays all workers and staff members their wages during their annual holidays.
    In 1949, the various expenses and preferential treatments received by residents from the state totaled more than 110 billion rubles, a figure almost three times higher than in 1940.
    In a socialist country, there is no and cannot be unemployment. Moreover, the number of workers and staff members is growing year by year. The total number of workers and staff members in 1949 increased by 15% compared to 1940.
    The Soviet people do not have to worry about tomorrow. They know that the Soviet government and the Communist Party are committed to further increasing the national income of the Soviet Union, further increasing the real wages of workers and staff members, and continuously reducing the prices of daily necessities.
    The life of the Soviet people is becoming increasingly prosperous and abundant. At the same time, the fundamental difference between the workers in the developing socialist countries and the decaying capitalist countries is becoming increasingly obvious.
    The outdated capitalist system plunges workers into unemployment, poverty, bankruptcy, and starvation.
    The monopoly groups that rule the capitalist countries use their economic and political power to strengthen the exploitation of the working class, make working conditions even worse, and implement a police system in enterprises.
    In order to pursue profits, monopoly groups raise prices and make the quality of daily necessities worse, resulting in a reduction in real wages.
    Another important reason for the deterioration of workers' conditions is the frenzied arms race. The United States itself is frantically expanding its arms, and the countries Marshallized are also expanding their military budgets and intensifying the arms race under the pressure of the United States. As a result, taxes are growing rapidly, and these growing taxes are entirely borne by the working class among the residents.
    Rising prices and preparations for war have led to inflation and currency depreciation, and the workers suffer the most from this. The currency devaluations carried out by many capitalist countries under the pressure of the United States also play the same role.
    The capitalists are shifting the entire burden of the new economic crisis, which started in the United States and spread to the rest of the capitalist countries, onto the shoulders of the workers. This new economic crisis means a violent blow to the material conditions of the working masses. As the economic crisis deepens and intensifies, the already meager consumption of the workers will be further reduced, and mass unemployment will increase even more. It should be known that there are now about 45 million unemployed people in the capitalist countries!
    The living standards of American workers in 1949 were 25% to 30% lower than before the war. The price of food has doubled compared to 1937. At the same time, the US government, implementing the will of the monopoly capitalists to maintain its extra profits by trying to keep prices at a high level, continues to reduce the planting area and destroy "surplus" grain.
    Inflation and military spending are constantly deteriorating the conditions of the broad masses of American workers. According to statistics from American economists, the average wage of a worker in the processing industry is barely enough for 40% of the living expenses of a family of four. Now, the wages of most workers in the United States are far below the minimum so-called moderate living expenses. Even workers with higher salaries are living in difficult times. Unemployment is constantly increasing; the ranks of the unemployed are actually close to 18 million (including the fully unemployed and those partially unemployed who mostly work only a few hours a week).
    In the UK, due to the arms race, the Labor government is increasing indirect taxes. Three-quarters of these indirect taxes are paid by the working class. Taxes in 1948 increased by 36.5% compared to 1947.
    According to materials from the British Ministry of Commerce, the wholesale prices of food and tobacco increased by 19% between December 1948 and December 1949. The UK still retains rationing of major foods. The diet of British workers has deteriorated significantly: for example, the average consumption of meat per capita has decreased by two times compared to the pre-war period. During the Labor government's tenure, the price of bread increased by 26%, the price of meat increased by 43%, and the price of sugar increased by 25%.
    The Labor government's policy of freezing wages, in the context of rising prices and taxes, has further deteriorated the conditions of British workers: their real wages are declining.
    In the UK, which once felt a shortage of labor after the war, unemployment is now growing rapidly. For example, recently several car factories and tractor factories have been cutting workers and changing to only working three days a week. All of these situations are just omens of the difficulties ahead for the British working class.
    In the capitalist countries of Western Europe, industrial production, on the whole, has not even reached the pre-war level of 1937, the conditions of the working class have become particularly difficult, and the goods consumed by the working people have been greatly reduced compared to the eve of World War II. A large amount of funds is used for armaments. American monopoly capital has ordered Western European countries that have accepted armaments to spend their own six to seven US dollars for every US dollar of "aid" they receive.
    As everyone knows, the "Marshall Plan" is one of the tools of US imperialism to fight for markets. The crisis phenomenon in the American economy is intensifying this struggle, and the result of this struggle is clearly in sight.
    The purchasing power of French workers is now less than 50% of the 1938 level. The price of food has increased twenty-fold compared to before the war.
    The conditions of Italian workers are extremely poor. In Italy, the number of unemployed increased by 39% in just one year in 1948. The current number of unemployed has reached 3 million. The meager unemployment benefits can only compensate for one-tenth of the living expenses of the worker's family, and less than half of the unemployed receive this benefit. At the same time, taxes and rent are constantly increasing, while food prices have increased sixty-fold compared to before the war.
    In Belgium, during the implementation of the "Marshall Plan," the number of unemployed, even according to official materials, has increased from 95,000 in April 1948 to 339,000 in January 1950.
    In Franco's Spain, the daily bread ration for workers has been reduced from 200 grams to 150 grams. The price of food and daily necessities has increased five-fold. The real wages of Spanish workers are less than one-quarter of the wages in 1936. Unemployment is very serious.
    The conditions of West German workers are also continuing to deteriorate. The real wages of workers are now only about 60% of the pre-war level. The proportion of wages of industrial workers in the total value of production was 50% in 1936, but has now dropped to 39%. The profits of capitalists have increased accordingly. The number of unemployed in West Germany increased from 239,000 in 1948 to 2 million. In addition, there are 1.8 million workers who cannot work full-time.
    In Tito-ruled Yugoslavia, the workers are in a very impoverished position due to the cruel exploitation of the masses by the murderers and spy gangs and the surrender of the country to the Anglo-American imperialists for slaughter. Workers and staff members in Belgrade have not received the food stipulated on the shopping vouchers for months: meat, oil, sugar, etc. Prices are rising so sharply that most residents have to go hungry.
    In capitalist countries, the deterioration of the material conditions of workers is a common phenomenon. Modern capitalism cannot even guarantee the survival of its hired slaves in their slave state. Capitalism is powerless to eliminate unemployment. It plunges the working masses into poverty and despair.
    Under modern conditions, the struggle of the working class against the capitalists' attack on their living standards is closely linked to the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism, and against the provocateurs of a new world war. The words "Peace, Democracy, Socialism" will be written on the banners of workers all over the world during the May Day parade. The Soviet Union, which leads the peace camp, is a beacon that points the way to happiness for all mankind. The Soviet people look to the future with confidence. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and their great leader Stalin, they are confidently marching towards the bright peak of communism.

　　苏联劳动者的生活水平的上升和资本主义各国劳动者的生活的恶化
    齐普拉柯夫
    五一节这天，当国际无产阶级进行检阅自己的力量的时候，他们以特别的热爱和自豪，把眼光转向苏联——全世界第一个社会主义获得胜利的国家。
    苏维埃国家是全世界普通百姓的圣地，在这里，一切都服从于人民的利益，一切都是为了劳动人民的利益而进行。
    一九四九年五一节以后的这一年，乃是苏联劳动者获得许多新成就的一年。乃是苏维埃社会制度和国家制度新的胜利的一年。
    苏联国民经济不断的和日益加速的高涨，乃是社会主义社会的一定不变的经济规律。与此同时并进的，是劳动者福利的不断增高，这就是苏维埃国家与资本主义阵营中一切国家的根本不同之处。而劳动者生活水平的不断提高，也同样是和苏联社会主义国家经济发展的基本规律相关的。
    苏联人民现正怀着满意的心情来回顾自己所获得的巨大的生产成就。这些巨大的生产成就，是由那为自己、为全社会的利益而工作、发挥自由的、创造性的劳动的人们获得的。战后苏联工业的总产量，曾每年增长了百分之二十乃至百分之二十以上。早在一九四九年底时，苏联全部工业产量就已超过了战前（一九四○年）产量的百分之四十一。各企业中现正采用着新的先进技术，以减轻工人的劳动和提高劳动生产率。
    一九四九年农业方面的总产量，已超过了战前一九四○年的水平。归劳动者支配的产品之丰裕情形在增长着。
    在苏维埃社会中，国民收入的分配，不是利于那些剥削阶级及其无数的寄生虫发财致富，而是利于提高工农物质状况以及扩大城市和乡村的社会主义生产。
    一九四九年，苏联的国民收入，已超过了战前水平百分之三十六。这就使得工人农民及知识分子的物质状况能够大大改善。工人和职员每人收入，按比较价格计算，一九四九年比一九四○年增加了百分之二十四。农民每人的收入，则增加了百分之三十以上。
    一九四七年十二月起，苏联曾三度实行减低日用品的价格。这样一来，居民的购买力提高了，工人与职员的实际工资也大大地增加了，农民在购买工业品方面的费用降低了。三度减低物价使居民于一年内在支出方面节省了大约二千六百七十亿卢布。
    在苏联、居民可以从国家方面领取补助金、工人和职员的社会保险费、抚恤金、免费医药救济、疗养院和休养所中的医疗，多儿母亲及单身母亲的补助费、技术的免费教育及提高、奖学金以及其他各种费用和优待等。国家还发给所有工人和职员每年的假期中的工资。
    一九四九年，居民从国家方面领得的各项费用和优待计一千一百亿卢布以上，这个数字几乎比一九四○年多了三倍。
    在社会主义国家内，没有也不可能有失业现象。不仅如此，工人和职员的数量还在逐年不断增长。一九四九年的工人职员总数，比一九四○年便增加了百分之十五。
    苏联人民不用担心明天。他们知道，苏联政府和共产党，正在致力于苏联国民收入更进一步的增长，工人和职员的实际工资更进一步的提高，以及日用品价格不断的减低。
    苏联人民的生活，正在日益富足和丰裕起来。同时，在发展着的社会主义国家劳动者与腐朽着的资本主义各国劳动者的状况之间的根本区别，也正在日益明显着。
    已经过时的资本主义制度，使劳动者陷于失业、贫困、破产及活活饿死的命运。
    统治着资本主义各国的垄断集团，利用自己经济上和政治上的权力，来加强对于工人阶级的剥削，使劳动条件更加恶劣，在企业内实行警察制度。
    独占集团为了追逐利润，就抬高物价并使日用品质量变坏，结果则是引起实际工资的降低。
    使劳动者状况恶化的另一个重要原因，乃是疯狂的军备竞赛。美国自己疯狂地扩充军备，而马歇尔化的各国，也在美国的压制下扩大自己的军事预算和加紧军备竞赛。因此，税捐就迅速增长，而这样增长的税捐，则完全由居民中的劳动阶层来负担的。
    物价上涨和对战争的准备，引起了通货膨胀、货币贬值，而由此受苦最大的又是劳动者。许多资本主义国家在美国压制下所进行的通货贬值，也是起着同样的作用。
    从美国开始而蔓延到其余资本主义国家的经济新危机的全部重担，资本家正转嫁之于劳动者的肩上。这种经济新危机，意味着对劳动群众物质状况的一个猛烈打击。而随着经济危机的加深和加剧，劳动者已经很低微的消费量将进一步的缩减，群众性的失业现象将更形增长。要知道，现在，各资本主义国家内的失业者，已经达到四千五百万人左右了！
    一九四九年美国工人的生活水平，已比战前降低了百分之二十五至三十。食品的价格，与一九三七年相比则增加了两倍。同时美国政府，执行着为保持自己额外利润而竭力把物价保持在高度水平上的独占资本家的意志，继续缩减着播种面积及销毁着“剩余”粮食。
    通货膨胀和军事开支，使美国广大工人群众的状况不断恶化。据美国经济学家的统计，加工工业方面一个工人的平均工资，勉强够四口之家生活必需费用的百分之四十。现在美国大多数工人的工资，大大低于所谓中等生活必需费用的最低限度。甚至薪金较高的工人，也在过困苦的日子了。失业现象正不断地增长；失业者队伍实际上已将近一千八百万人（包括完全失业者和那些部分就业大多一星期只作工几小时的部分失业者）。
    在英国，由于军备竞赛，工党政府在增加着间接税。这种间接税中的四分之三，是由工人阶级所缴纳的。一九四八年的税捐，比一九四七年增加了百分之三十六点五。
    根据英国商务部的材料，从一九四八年十二月至一九四九年十二月这一年间，粮食及烟草的批发价格已提高了百分之十九。英国直到现在，还保留着主要食品的配给制。英国工人的口粮大大恶化了：例如，每一口人的肉类平均消费量，比战前时期减少了两倍。在工党政府执政期间，面包价格增加了百分之二十六，肉类价格增加了百分之四十三，食糖价格增加了百分之二十五。
    工党政府的冻结工资的政策，在物价和税收增长的情形下，使英国工人的状况更形恶化：他们的实际工资是日益降低了。
    在战后曾感觉到劳动力不够的英国，现在失业现象正迅速地增长着。例如，最近有若干汽车工厂和拖拉机工厂，都在实行裁减工人，改成每星期只开工三日。所有这种种情形都只是预示着英国工人阶级前途困难的朕兆。
    在西欧各资本主义国家内，工业生产量，整个说来，甚至还未达到战前一九三七年的水准，工人阶级的状况变得特别困难，劳动人民消费的物品，比第二次世界大战前夕大大地减少了。大批款项用于军备。美国的独占资本，曾命令接受武装的西欧各国，在领到美国每一美元的“援助”后，应再花费自己的六——七美元。
    众所周知，“马歇尔计划”乃是美帝国主义为争夺市场而斗争的工具之一。美国经济中的危机现象，使这种斗争剧烈化，而这斗争的结果已显然在望了。
    法国劳动者的购买力，现在还不到一九三八年水准的百分之五十。食品的价格，比战前增加了二十倍。
    意大利工人的状况真是穷困之极。在意大利，失业者人数，仅在一九四八年一年间就增加了百分之三十九。而现在的失业者已达到了三百万人。少得可怜的失业救济费，只能抵偿劳动者家庭十分之一的生活必需费用，何况领取这种救济费的还不到失业者的一半。同时税捐、房租却不断地增加，而食品价格则比战前增加了六十倍。
    在比利时，于“马歇尔计划”实行期间失业者的数目，甚至根据官方的材料，已自一九四八年四月的九万五千人增到一九五○年一月的三十三万九千人了。
    在弗朗哥西班牙境内工人的每日面包配给额，已从二百公分减少到一百五十公分。食品及日用品价格，增加了五倍。西班牙工人的实际工资，还不到一九三六年工资的四分之一。失业现象十分严重。
    西德劳动者的状况，也在继续恶化。现在工人的实际工资，仅达战前水准的百分之六十左右。产业工人的工资在生产品总值中所占的比重，在一九三六年时为百分之五十，而在现今已降至百分之三十九。资本家的利润则相应地增加了。西德失业者人数，在一九四八年从二十三万九千人增加到二百万人。此外还有一百八十万工人，也不能作整工。
    在铁托统治的南斯拉夫境内，由于杀人犯及间谍匪帮残酷地剥削人民群众、并把国家送给英美帝国主义者去宰割的结果，劳动者处在非常贫困的地位。贝尔格莱德的工人和职员，一连数月领不到购物证上所规定的食品：肉类、油脂、食糖等。物价高涨得那么厉害，大多数居民只得挨饿。
    在资本主义各国中，劳动者物质状况之恶化，乃是普遍的现象。现代资本主义对于自己的雇佣奴隶，甚至连他们的奴隶状态的生存都不能保证了。资本主义无力消除失业现象。它使劳动群众陷于贫穷和绝望的境地。
    在现代的条件下，工人阶级为反对资本家向他们生活水准进攻的斗争，是与争取和平、民主、社会主义，反对新的世界大战的挑拨者的斗争密切地相连着的。“和平、民主、社会主义”这几个字，将被全世界劳动者在五一节列队游行时，写在旗帜上。领导和平阵营的苏联，乃是替全人类指示一条达到幸福道路的灯塔。苏维埃人民满怀信心地展望着将来。在共产党和自己伟大领袖斯大林的领导之下，他们满怀信心地向着共产主义的光明的高峰迈进。
