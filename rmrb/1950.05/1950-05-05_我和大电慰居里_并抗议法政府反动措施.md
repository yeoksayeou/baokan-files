　　Xinhua News Agency, 4th. The Chinese Committee for the Defence of World Peace has telegraphed its condolences to Professor Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, and protested the French government's dismissal of him from his position as High Commissioner for Atomic Energy. The text of the telegram is as follows:

　　Professor Joliot-Curie:

　　We have learned that the reactionary French Bidault government, at the instigation of the American imperialists, has dismissed you from your posts as High Commissioner for Atomic Energy and member of the Atomic Energy Commission. This reactionary measure by the Bidault government not only violates the glorious tradition of French democratic progress, but also aroused the boundless anger of nearly one billion peace-loving people around the world. In addition to lodging a serious protest against the French government's crime of persecuting the peace movement, we also extend to you our highest respect and cordial greetings, and wish you continued success in uniting scientists, writers, artists, and the broad masses of people with a sense of justice around the world to fight for the defense of world peace and people's democracy!

　　Guo Moruo, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for the Defence of World Peace
　　May 4, 1950

　　我和大电慰居里
    并抗议法政府反动措施
    【新华社四日讯】中国保卫世界和平大会委员会顷致电慰问世界拥护和平大会常设委员会主席约里奥——居里教授，并抗议法国政府解除他的原子能高级专员的职务。电文如下：约里奥——居里教授：
    我们获悉法国皮杜尔反动政府受美帝国主义者的指使，竟解除了你的原子能高级专员和原子能委员会委员的职务。皮杜尔政府这一反动措施，不仅违反了法兰西民主进步的光荣传统，并激起了全世界近十万万爱好和平的人民的无比愤怒。我们除对法国政府这一迫害和平运动的罪行提出严重抗议外，并向你致崇高的敬礼和亲切的慰问，祝你再接再厉地团结全世界的科学家、文学家、艺术家以及有正义感的广大人民，为保卫世界和平和人民民主而斗争！
     中国保卫世界和平大会委员会主席郭沫若
      一九五○年五月四日
