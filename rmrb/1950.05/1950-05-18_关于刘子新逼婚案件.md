Short Commentary

    On the Liu Zixin Forced Marriage Case
    The mistakes made by Comrade Liu Zixin, secretary of the Fourth District Party Committee of Shouzhang County, Pingyuan Province, are serious and of a principled nature. Because he not only violated policies and lost the stance of a Communist Party member, but also violated laws and disciplines, he should not only be subject to disciplinary action by the Party, but also be sanctioned by law. In particular, abandoning his work during the tense production and disaster relief efforts, causing great losses to the masses, and damaging the political prestige of the Party and the government among the masses, is an act of betrayal against the Party, the government, and the broad masses of people. We urge the Discipline Inspection Commission of the Pingyuan Provincial Party Committee of the CPC and the Pingyuan Provincial Government to handle this case seriously.

    Secondly, the self-criticism of the Shouzhang County Party Committee is insufficient. It only pointed out that the County Party Committee usually fostered Liu Zixin's arrogance and self-importance, and only pointed out that there were serious problems in the leadership of the County Party Committee, but it did not explain what these "serious problems" were and how they should be resolved. The Liu Zixin case is a good living teaching material, and the Shouzhang County Party Committee should use it well to educate all cadres in the county, so as to improve their ideological and policy levels and strengthen their ties with the masses.

　　关于刘子新逼婚案件
    平原省寿张县四区中共区委书记刘子新同志所犯的错误，是严重的原则性的错误。因为他不但违反政策，丧失了共产党员的立场，而且触犯法纪，所以不但应受党纪的处分，而且应受法律的制裁。特别是在紧张的生产救灾工作中放弃了自己的工作，使群众受到很大的损失，使党和政府在群众中的政治威信遭受损害，这更是对党、对政府、对广大人民的犯罪行为。我们要求中共平原省党委纪律委员会和平原省政府严正处理这一案件。
    其次，寿张县委的自我检讨是不够的。仅仅指出县委平日助长刘子新的自高自大情绪，仅仅指出在县委会的领导上存在着严重问题，但没有说明这“严重问题”到底在那里，应如何解决。刘子新案件是很好的活教材，寿张县委应该好好运用它来教育全县干部，借以提高他们的思想水平和政策水平，加强他们与群众的联系。
