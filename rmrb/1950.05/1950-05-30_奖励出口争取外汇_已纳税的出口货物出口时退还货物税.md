　　Reward Exports to Earn Foreign Exchange
    Refund Commodity Tax on Exported Goods That Have Already Been Taxed
    [Xinhua News Agency, 27th] In order to reward exports and earn foreign exchange, the Financial and Economic Committee of the Central People's Government Administration Council has decided to implement a method of refunding commodity tax on exported goods that have already been taxed at the time of export. The specific procedures and regulations will be determined jointly by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Trade, and the People's Bank. According to the original regulations, commodity tax was not refunded for goods that had already been taxed upon export, but was subsidized by the foreign trade department; since its implementation, there have been many difficulties, hence this decision by the Financial and Economic Committee.

    【新华社二十七日讯】中央人民政府政务院财政经济委员会为奖励出口，争取外汇，特决定对已经纳税的出口货物，于出口时实行退还货物税办法。其具体手续章则等，将由财政部与贸易部会同人民银行决定。按已经纳税的货物，原规定出口时不退货物税，改由对外贸易部门补贴；实行以来，困难甚多，故财经委员会有此次决定。
