　　On Reporting Conference News
　　The General Administration of News's "Decision on Improving Newspaper Work" points out: "Whether it is central, greater administrative region, or provincial-level newspapers, the amount of space dedicated to unimportant remarks and actions of meetings, official activities, responsible personnel, and announcements and telegrams without broad importance should be reduced." This instruction is aimed at the existing shortcomings of our newspaper work.
　　When we examined the local news of major national newspapers in February, we found that conference news generally occupied a large portion of the space; in some cases, conference news accounted for more than 40 percent of the total local news space. In April, some newspapers reduced the amount of conference news, but many newspapers still devoted a large portion of their space to reporting on conferences. For example, in important newspapers such as Henan Daily, Southern Daily, Chongqing Xinhua Daily, and Jinan Dazhong Daily, the amount of space dedicated to conference news still accounted for 20 percent, or even more than 30 percent. Therefore, it is necessary for all newspapers to examine their work based on the General Administration of News's "Decision on Improving Newspaper Work" and reduce the space used for conference news.
　　Our newspapers have some important and well-written conference news. For example, Hebei Daily published a news report on the People's Congress of the First District of Mancheng County on April 3. Although this news report still has shortcomings in writing, the content of the meeting is valuable, and the writing is generally vivid. From this report, we can not only see the election of the district people's government and the formulation of the district's production plan, but also see the activeness of the peasant representatives, how the representatives overcame some incorrect ideas and formulated a good production plan, and the unparalleled joy felt by the peasants because they enjoyed genuine democratic life. This kind of conference news is also permeated with the actual life of the people and should occupy a certain position in our newspapers.
　　So, what causes conference news to occupy too much space? The reason is that in addition to these necessary conference news, there is also much conference news that is unnecessary and can be left unreported; or the reporting method should be improved, and the space occupied should be reduced.
　　First of all, some of our journalists have the idea that "a meeting is news," so newspapers publish news about some meetings that are not important or of concern to readers. These news reports often simply report that a meeting was held, who attended, and what topics were discussed, but the real content of the meeting is not reported at all—not because such a meeting must publish a communique, but simply as a kind of "news." What is the purpose of such conference news for readers other than stating that such a meeting was held? There is no purpose. This kind of conference news should be resolutely eliminated.
　　Secondly, there is a formula for conference news in our news reports. This formula started God knows when, but it is still widely used today. For example, from April 9, Jinan Dazhong Daily continuously reported on news related to the First Shandong Provincial Student Congress. This meeting should be reported. However, Dazhong Daily's report on this meeting did not focus on showing the situation, problems, and development direction of the student movement in Shandong Province to illustrate the significance of the establishment of the Shandong Student Federation in the meeting; but mainly reported the activities of the congress itself, and even had repetitive content. The news comprehensively reported on the process of the congress itself, including the imminent opening of the congress, the registration of representatives, the preparatory meeting, the study of documents by representatives, the adoption of the congress agenda and the list of the presidium, the opening and closing of the congress, congratulatory messages from all parties, and the congress's telegram. The process of the meeting itself is comprehensive in the news, complete indeed, but precisely these things have nothing to do with the general readers. Because these things occupy a major position, the central content that should be reported is relegated to a secondary position. This is an example of the formulaic reporting of conference news. This reporting formula fills our many important conference news that should be reported with some unnecessary things.
　　Henan Daily's news report on the First Henan Provincial People's Congress also has points worth studying. The First Henan Provincial People's Congress was not only a major event in Henan, but also a major event in the entire Central and South China region (the first provincial-level people's congress held in the Central and South China region). It was entirely right for Henan Daily to attach importance to this reporting work, but it was not reported well. From the preparatory meeting before the congress to the speeches of the representatives during the congress and the dissemination after the meeting, the pages of the newspaper were often filled, so that statistics show that in April, the pre- and post-reports of this meeting accounted for 23 percent of the local news of the newspaper; that is to say, almost a quarter of the local news in a month was about this one thing. Obviously, in such a large percentage, some parts can be cut; the shortcoming of not distinguishing between the important and the unimportant in the reporting of conference news is an important reason why our newspapers are full of conference news.
　　These facts show that the amount of space occupied by conference news in our newspapers can be reduced. We should eliminate the nonsense-style conference news and the nonsense in conference news in our newspapers. This is not simply looking at the problem from a quantitative point of view. When handling conference news, the newspaper editorial department should have this understanding: the conference itself is not news; the newspaper publishes conference news to guide the people's work and life, and there is no other purpose besides this. Starting from this understanding, the handling of conference news should pay attention to these two aspects:
　　First, not reporting any meeting casually, but knowing what to choose. We should report conference news whose content is closely related to people's lives and therefore should be known to readers, and we should not use valuable space to publish conference news whose content is not closely related to people's lives.
　　Second, we should focus on reporting the conference content that is closely related to people's lives: the necessary knowledge of why those questions were raised and why those decisions were made; instead of focusing on the conference process itself, which has nothing to do with people's lives. The old-fashioned reporting formula for conference news must be thoroughly broken.
　　Only in this way can necessary conference news have its value, and after greatly reducing the space occupied by conference news, the newspaper can have more space to report on the actual life and labor production of the people.

### 论会议新闻的报道

专栏：报纸述评

　　论会议新闻的报道
    新闻总署《关于改进报纸工作的决定》中指出：“无论是中央的、大行政区的或省以下的报纸，都应当减少关于会议、机关活动、负责人员的不重要的言论行动、没有广泛重要性的文告文电的篇幅。”这个指示是针对着我们的报纸工作现存的缺点而发的。
    当我们检查二月份全国重要报纸的地方新闻时，发现会议新闻一般地占了很大一部分篇幅；个别的情形有会议新闻占地方新闻全部篇幅百分之四十以上的。四月份中有些报纸的会议新闻减少了一些，但许多报纸还是把很大一部分篇幅用在会议新闻的报道上。例如河南日报、南方日报、重庆新华日报、济南大众日报这样的重要报纸上，会议新闻的篇幅仍占了百分之二十、甚至百分之三十以上。因此，各报根据新闻总署《关于改进报纸工作的决定》检查自己的工作，减少使用在会议新闻上的篇幅，是必要的。
    我们的报纸上有一些重要的和写得好的会议新闻。例如，河北日报四月三日发表了满城县第一区人民代表大会的新闻报道，这篇新闻在写作上虽然还有缺点，但会议的内容是有价值的，报道的文字大体上也是生动的。从这个报道不仅可以看到区人民政府的选举、全区生产计划的制订，而且可以看到农民代表们的活跃，看到代表们怎样克服了一些不正确的思想而订出良好的生产计划，看到农民因享受了真正民主生活而感到的无上喜悦。这种会议新闻也是贯串着人民实际生活的，应该在我们的报纸上占有一定的地位。
    那么，什么原因使会议新闻占据了太多的篇幅呢？原因就在于除了这些必要的会议新闻之外，还有许多会议新闻是不必要的，可以不报道；或者应当改进报道的方法，缩小所占据的篇幅。
    首先，我们有一些新闻工作者存在着“会议就是新闻”的思想，因此对于一些并不具有什么重要性、也不为读者所关切的会议，报纸也发表了新闻。这些新闻常常只是平铺直叙地报告在那里开了一个什么会，到了一些什么人，讨论了一些什么题目，但是会议的真正内容却完全没有报道，——并不是因为这样的会议必须发表什么公报，只是当作一种“新闻”。这样的会议新闻除说明开了这样一个会以外，对读者究竟有什么作用呢？没有什么作用。这种会议新闻应该坚决加以肃清。
    其次，在我们的新闻报道上存在着一种会议新闻的公式，这种公式不知始于何年何月，却是至今仍被广泛地套用着的。例如从四月九日起，济南大众日报连续报道了有关山东省第一届学生代表会议的新闻。这个会议是应该加以报道的。但大众日报对这个会议的报道不是集中地表现山东省学生运动的情况、问题和发展方向，以此来说明会议中产生山东学联的意义；而主要地是报道大会本身的活动，甚至有内容重复的地方。报纸一连串地报道了大会即将开幕、代表报到、预备会议、代表学习文件，通过会议日程和主席团名单、大会揭幕和闭幕的情况、各方贺电和大会通电等。会议本身的过程在新闻中是面面俱到的，完整倒是完整得很，但恰好这些东西是与一般读者没有什么关系的。由于这些东西占了主要的地位，就使应该报道的中心内容反而退居次要的地位了。这就是会议新闻的公式化报道之一例，这种报道公式使我们的许多应该报道的重要会议新闻中，充塞着一些不必要的东西。
    河南日报关于河南省第一届全省人民代表会议的新闻报道同样有值得研究的地方。河南省第一届全省人民代表会议不仅在河南是一件大事，就是在整个中南区也是一件大事（是中南区召开的第一个全省性人民代表会议）。河南日报重视了这一报道工作，是完全应该的，但是并没有报道得很好。从大会之前的筹备会，到大会中各代表的讲话以及会后的传达，时常充满了报纸的篇幅，以至统计四月份该报的地方新闻中，这一会议的前后报道就占了百分之二十三；也就是说，一个月的地方新闻中几乎有四分之一是报道这一件事的。显然的，在这样大的百分比中，有一部分是可以加以剪裁的；会议新闻的报道中存在着不分轻重的缺点，是使我们的报纸上充满着会议新闻的一个重要原因。
    这些事实说明，我们报纸上会议新闻的篇幅是可以减少的。应该在我们报纸上肃清废话式的会议新闻和会议新闻中的废话。这不是单纯地从数量上去看问题，报纸编辑部在处理会议新闻时，应该具有这样的认识：会议本身并不是新闻；报纸发表会议新闻，是为了指导人民的工作和生活，除此以外，就没有什么其他的目的。从这一认识出发，处理会议新闻就应该注意到这样两个方面：
    第一，不是报道随便什么会议，而应该知所选择。我们应该报道那些内容与人民生活有密切关系，因而是读者应该知道的会议新闻，而不应该用可贵的篇幅去登那些内容与人民生活没有什么密切关系的会议新闻。
    第二，我们应该集中报道那些与人民生活有密切关系的会议内容：为什么提出那些问题，为什么作出那样的决定的必要的知识；而不是把注意力放在那些与人民生活没有什么关系的会议过程本身。那种老一套的会议新闻的报道公式必须彻底打破。
    只有这样，必要的会议新闻才能有它的价值，而在大量减少会议新闻所占的篇幅以后，报纸才能有更大的篇幅来报道人民实际生活和劳动生产的状况。
