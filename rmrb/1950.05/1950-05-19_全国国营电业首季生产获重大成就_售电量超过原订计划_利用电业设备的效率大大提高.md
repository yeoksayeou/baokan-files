Xinhua News Agency, 17th. The national state-owned electrical industry achieved significant success in its operations during the first quarter of this year. Electricity sales exceeded the original plan by 12 percent, accounting for 25.3 percent of the annual plan; compared with the same period last year, it increased by 77 percent. Among them, the Northeast and North China regions overfulfilled the plan by 16 percent and 13 percent respectively; the East China region only completed 88 percent of the original plan due to the lack of unified leadership in the electricity industry and the impact of enemy air raids. A significant improvement in electricity production during the first quarter was the greatly improved efficiency of using electrical equipment, which not only reduced the enormous waste caused by the unreasonable use of equipment but also shattered the technical conservatism of some old technicians who were satisfied with the old production levels. Last year, the average possible output of state-owned electrical equipment in the Northeast, North China, and East China regions accounted for only 65.1 percent of the equipment's rated capacity; after the first National Electricity Conference in February this year, the Ministry of Fuel Industry raised its standard to 78.8 percent. However, under the direct leadership of the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry and the specific assistance of Soviet experts, after overhauling the machinery and furnaces according to the plan, the output of many motors in North China Electricity has greatly exceeded the 78.8 percent regulation. For example, the output rate of the No. 6 generator at the Beijing Shijingshan Power Plant, which was sabotaged by Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents in September last year, has now reached 100 percent; this is something that the machine has never achieved since its installation. The output of the No. 3 generator in the plant and the No. 4 generator in the Fengshan Power Plant has also increased by 11 percent and 87.5 percent respectively. In the past, some technicians believed that the machines were too old or that the output of Japanese-made machines could not reach the specified capacity. This conservative thinking has now been broken by the collective efforts of the workers.

　　　Reducing Consumption, Lowering Costs
　　In the first quarter, the national electricity industry also made significant progress in reducing coal consumption, self-consumption of electricity, and line losses, thereby reducing power generation costs. The self-consumption rate decreased by 10.3 percent, the line loss rate decreased by 18.6 percent, and the coal consumption rate decreased by 0.9 percent. Compared with the same period in 1949, the self-consumption rate decreased by 23 percent, the line loss rate decreased by 51.4 percent, and the coal consumption rate decreased by 16 percent. If the saved electricity and coal are converted into millet, the savings from self-consumption of electricity and line losses in the first quarter of this year is 42 million jin of millet compared to the same period in 1949.
　　However, reducing accidents remains one of the most important issues to be resolved in current electricity production. In the first quarter, there were 582 accidents in Northeast, 51 in North China, and 124 in East China, totaling 757 accidents. Although this is much less than the 1,789 accidents in the same period in 1949 (only figures for the Northeast and North China regions), an average of eight accidents still occur nationwide every day. Therefore, the Northeast, North China, and East China Electric Power Administration Bureaus or Management Offices have made "eliminating liability accidents and ensuring safe power generation" the focus of their work in the second quarter.

### 全国国营电业首季生产获重大成就　售电量超过原订计划　利用电业设备的效率大大提高

　　全国国营电业首季生产获重大成就
　　售电量超过原订计划
　　利用电业设备的效率大大提高
    【新华社十七日讯】全国国营电气事业的经营在今年第一季中获得了重大的成就。售电量共超过原订计划百分之十二，占全年计划的百分之二十五点三；与去年同期比较，则增加了百分之七十七。其中东北和华北两区分别超额完成计划百分之十六和百分之十三；华东区则因电业领导关系未统一及敌机空袭影响，只完成原计划的百分之八十八。第一季中在电业生产上有重大意义的改进是利用电业设备的效率大大提高，因而不但减少了因设备不能合理利用而造成的巨大浪费，而且打破了若干旧技术人员满足于旧有生产水平的技术上的保守思想。去年东北、华北、华东三区国营电业设备的平均可能出力仅占设备额定容量的百分之六十五点一；今年二月全国第一次电业会议后，燃料工业部将其标准提高到百分之七十八点八。但华北电业在中央燃料工业部直接领导和苏联专家的具体帮助下按照计划检修机炉后，不少电机出力已大大超过了百分之七十八点八的规定。如曾被蒋匪特务于去年九月间破坏的北京石景山发电厂六号发电机的出力率，现已达到百分之一百；这是该机自按装以来所从未达到过的。该厂三号发电机和凤山发电厂四号发电机的出力亦较前提高了百分之十一和百分之八十七点五。以往若干技术人员认为机器太老或日本制造的机器出力一定不能达到规定容量的保守思想，现已为职工集体努力的成果所打破。
            减少消耗  成本降低
    第一季中全国电业在减少煤炭消耗、自用电和线路损失方面也有显著进步，因而使发电成本较前减低，计自用电率降低了百分之十点三，线路损失率降低了百分之十八点六，煤耗率降低了百分之零点九。和一九四九年同期比较，则自用电率降低了百分之二十三，线路损失率降低了百分之五十一点四，煤耗率降低了百分之十六。如将节省下来的电量和煤炭以小米折算，今年第一季自用电和线路损失两项较一九四九年同时期节省小米四千二百万斤。
    但是，减少事故仍是目前电业生产中亟待解决的重要问题之一。第一季中发生的事故计东北五百八十二次，华北五十一次，华东一百二十四次，合计七百五十七次。虽然比一九四九年同期的一千七百八十九次（仅东北、华北两区数字）减少很多，但平均每日全国仍有八次事故发生。因此东北、华北、华东各区电业管理局或管理处已将“消灭责任事故，保证安全发电”作为第二季工作的重心。
