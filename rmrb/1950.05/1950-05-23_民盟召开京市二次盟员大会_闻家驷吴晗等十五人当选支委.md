China Democratic League Holds Second Municipal Congress in Beijing
    Wen Jiasi, Wu Han and Fifteen Others Elected to Branch Committee

    [Reported by this newspaper] The Second Congress of all members of the Democratic League in Beijing was held at the Xiehe Auditorium at 9:30 AM on the 21st. 313 members attended, with guests including Peng Zhen and Cui Yueli from the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Vice Mayor of the Municipal Government Zhang Youyu, Zhou Fanwen from the Beijing Municipal Branch of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Ling Qijun from the Beijing Municipal Branch of the China Democratic National Construction Association, and Song Kuangwo from the Municipal Consultative Committee. Chairman Zhang Lan also attended to provide guidance. After Wu Han gave a summary report on the branch's work over the past year, Vice Chairman Shen Junru delivered a speech on behalf of Chairman Zhang Lan, stating: Chairman Mao has called on Party members to unite and cooperate with non-Party members, and cooperation is a two-way street. Our League members must also cooperate well with Party members and other non-League members; we cannot just talk about accepting the leadership of the CCP, we must accept it through practical actions and work. Now that national economic construction and cultural construction, etc., have begun on a national scale, our League members across the country should work hard and diligently to coordinate with the work and step up learning and progress. Following this, Shen Yifan reported on the preparations for the election. Zhang Bojun, the headquarters' election representative, delivered a speech, emphasizing that League members should not only be consistent and compliant with all the policies of the "Common Program", but also consistent and compliant with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CCP, spoke about the significance and methods of unity, and that criticism and self-criticism are the most effective weapons for achieving unity. Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu encouraged everyone to work together for the municipal work. Zhou Fanwen, the representative of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, expressed the hope that members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and League members would learn from each other. Representatives from various district branches spoke freely one after another, while elections were conducted simultaneously. As a result of the ballot count, Wen Jiasi, Wu Han, Zeng Zhaolun, Fei Xiaotong, Li Helin, Chen Dingwen, Zhang Manjun, Guan Shixiong, Shen Yifan, Lin Zhongyi, Li Jiansheng, Wu Yuheng, Min Ganghou, Ye Duzhuang, and Yan Xinmin were elected as members of the Second Beijing Municipal Branch Committee; Tao Dayong, Wang Maichu, Chang Renxia, Ye Dingyi, and Fan Ning were elected as alternate members. The congress passed the "Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao," "Telegram of Respect to Commander-in-Chief Zhu and the People's Liberation Army," "Telegram of Respect to Commanders and Fighters on the Front Lines of the Zhoushan Islands," "Circular Telegram Calling for Signatures in Support of Defending World Peace," "Telegram Calling on League Members Nationwide to Relieve Unemployed Workers in Shanghai," and "Telegram of Condolences to Families of Deceased Martyrs of Our League." The congress victoriously concluded at 4 PM amidst loud slogans.
