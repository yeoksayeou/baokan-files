　　[Jinan News] According to the Dazhong Daily news: The Bohai Military Region troops have achieved great results in their spring production work. Since the end of January this year, all units of the military region have enthusiastically投入了 engaged in the production campaign. The military region's guard regiment, training regiment, cavalry regiment, etc., successively braved wind, snow, and severe cold to reclaim wasteland in Kenli and rush to plant spring wheat. The military region's headquarters, political department, supply department, health department and other units, in cooperation with the local government and the masses, also planted more than 2,000 mu of vegetables and autumn grain; at the same time, they launched a small-scale land reclamation campaign, turning the walls and moats near the駐地 garrison into fertile fields. In terms of industry, cotton ginning factories, oil presses, cigarette factories, and soap factories were established. In terms of sideline production, activities such as making tofu, sprouting bean sprouts, catching fish, collecting firewood, transportation, and grinding flour (self-milled and self-consumed) were carried out. Over the past three months, with the concerted efforts of the entire military region, the half-year production plan has been initially completed. It is estimated that a total of 16,259.8 mu of spring wheat, peas, sorghum, vegetable gardens, etc., have been cultivated in agricultural production. Based on the lowest yield, it is estimated that 2,507,560 jin of grain can be produced. After deducting grain for seeds, land rent, tool compensation, etc., 2,304,535 jin of grain can be obtained. In addition, more than 3,640,000 jin of firewood can be obtained; the income from sideline production can be converted into 30,000 jin of grain, and the profits from industrial production can be converted into 161,654 jin of grain. The food expenses of all commanders and fighters in the Bohai Military Region for half a year are completely self-sufficient, totaling approximately 1,343,104 jin of millet. The income from agricultural and sideline production alone can still leave a surplus of 991,431 jin of millet. After deducting 40% of the private dividends from this amount, there is a net surplus of 594,861 jin of grain, not including all the profits from industrial production. The spring wheat and peas planted by various units can be harvested in early June. If there are no unexpected disasters, a good wheat harvest can be expected.
