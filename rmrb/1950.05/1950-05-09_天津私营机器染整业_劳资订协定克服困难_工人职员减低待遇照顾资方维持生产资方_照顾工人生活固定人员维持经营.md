Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 8th. To assist employers in overcoming temporary difficulties, the employees of the Tianjin private machine dyeing and finishing industry, after joint consultation between the textile industry union and the industry's employers' association, formulated a "Temporary Measures Agreement for Resolving Current Difficulties." This agreement was officially signed on the 6th and formally approved by the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau, and will be implemented immediately. The agreement stipulates that employees will reduce compensation to support employers to maintain production on the one hand; on the other hand, it stipulates that employers must ensure the minimum living standards of workers, retain personnel, and maintain operations to overcome temporary difficulties.

There are 47 private machine dyeing and finishing factories in Tianjin, employing approximately 2,200 people. The main dyeing machines number 860, with a daily production capacity of 12,000 bolts. Since liberation, the businesses of these factories have flourished, mainly processing materials for the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Corporation and other organizations, cooperatives, and merchants, with very few purchasing raw materials, dyeing, and selling themselves. Due to the thriving business, wages in some factories have been adjusted several times, generally higher than before liberation. However, in recent months, colored cloth has experienced temporary sluggish sales, causing significant difficulties for the industry. Currently, most factories in the industry have suspended operations, with only a little over a quarter remaining open, and some of these are operating at half-capacity, resulting in widespread wage arrears. The reasons for these difficulties, in addition to stagnant sales, include many unreasonable phenomena in the general factory management, and some employers' unwillingness to actively invest in maintaining production.

In light of the above situation, the employees of the industry, to implement the policy of developing production and benefiting both labor and management, with the assistance and guidance of the Municipal Labor Bureau, the Industry and Commerce Bureau, and the Textile Workers' Union, began in mid-March to consult with employers on specific measures to help them overcome current temporary difficulties and weather the storm. After three formal consultations, the "Temporary Measures Agreement for Resolving Current Difficulties" was finally formulated. During the consultation process, the general workers, proceeding from the overall long-term interests of developing production, took the initiative to assist employers in overcoming current difficulties and made many concessions, fully demonstrating the great spirit of the working class. This also dispelled many unnecessary concerns on the part of employers.

Main Contents of the Agreement
The main contents of the "Temporary Measures Agreement for Resolving Current Difficulties in the Tianjin Private Machine Dyeing and Finishing Industry" are: (1) Regarding wages, it is stipulated that the salaries of employees engaged in production will temporarily be calculated based on actual output (piece-rate system) according to the original standard; to maintain the minimum living expenses of employees and their families, each factory may, based on the employee's monthly base salary and the different circumstances, pay 10% to 30% of the original salary (if the salary calculated according to output exceeds this provision, it will be paid according to the output calculation); if the situation is better, the labor and management can agree to exceed this provision; if there are indeed special difficulties and the factory is unable to bear the above provisions, the labor and management can agree to reduce it appropriately, but this does not apply to the original separate agreements between labor and management of some factories, which will continue to be handled as before; each factory must try to pay the arrears of salaries and year-end gifts to employees as soon as possible, except for major expenses; to reduce the employer's burden, all personnel who are nominally receiving salaries will be terminated. Existing employee benefits will be provided as much as possible if the employer can afford it; if the employer cannot afford it, it can be reduced or exempted by agreement between labor and management. (2) To reduce the factory's expenses, employees can take turns going home to live, with the time at home limited to one to two months, and the round-trip travel expenses will be borne by the employer; employees living at home will still receive the aforementioned minimum living expenses; if the factory's production situation improves or returns to normal, the employer will recall them to work by registered letter, and employees must return to the factory within ten days of receiving the notice, otherwise it will be considered a voluntary resignation, and other employees will be hired (if there are special circumstances, a written leave application is required). (3) To maintain business, each factory shall fix the following personnel by agreement between labor and management: manager, technician, accountant, business, external affairs, cook, sorting, union负责人，以便管理业务和进行工会的工作;负责人's, in order to manage business and carry out union work;负责人's salaries, regardless of whether the factory is producing or not, will temporarily be paid at half salary; when the production volume exceeds half salary, it will be paid according to the actual production volume; however, the salaries of union負責人 are the same as those of general employees. (4) The above temporary agreement may be terminated by either party when the factory's production improves, but it must be approved by the Labor Bureau after consultation between labor and management before it can take effect.

　　天津私营机器染整业  劳资订协定克服困难
    工人职员减低待遇照顾资方维持生产资方
    照顾工人生活固定人员维持经营
    【新华社天津八日电】天津市私营机器染整业职工为协助资方克服当前暂时性的困难，经过纺织业工会和该业资方同业公会共同协商拟订的“解决当前困难临时办法协定”，已于六日正式签字，并经天津市人民政府劳动局正式批准，即日开始实行。这个协定一方面规定职工减低待遇，照顾资方，使能维持生产；另一方面规定资方必须照顾工人的最低生活，并固定人员，维持经营，以渡过暂时困难。
    天津市私营机器染整工厂，共有四十七家，全部从业人员约二千二百人，主要染布机器有八百六十台，生产能力可日达一万二千匹。解放以来，各该工厂营业都很发达，主要是给花纱布公司及其他机关、合作社与客商等进行加工，而自购原料、自染自销的则为数很少。由于营业发达，有些工厂工资曾经数度调整，一般均较解放前提高。但最近数月来，色布暂时滞销，使该业遭受很大困难。截至目前，该业工厂大部停工，开工者仅占全业四分之一强，其中一部分也陷于半停工状态，因而积欠工资成为普遍现象。这种困难情况的所以发生，除因销路停滞外，一般工厂经营管理上存在许多不合理的现象，有些资方不愿积极投资维持生产等，也是重要原因。
    根据上述情况，该业职工为贯彻发展生产、劳资两利的政策，乃在市劳动局、工商局及纺织工会协助指导下，于三月中旬起，和资方协商如何协助资方克服当前暂时困难、渡过困难的具体办法；中经三次正式协商，终于拟订了“解决当前困难临时办法协定”。在协商过程中，一般工人从发展生产的全局的远大利益出发，主动协助资方克服当前困难，多方让步，充分表现了工人阶级的伟大气魄，资方亦因此消除了许多不必要的顾虑。
    协定主要内容
    “天津市私营机器染整业解决当前困难临时办法协定”的主要内容是：（一）关于工资，规定进行生产的职工薪资按原有标准暂时改为按实际产量计算（计件制）；为了维持职工及其家属的最低生活费用，各厂得依各职工每月基本工资额按照情况之不同，发给原薪百分之十至百分之三十（如按产量计算其工资超过此规定时，则按产量计算发给之）；如其情况较好者，经劳资双方协议可超过此规定；而确有特殊困难无力负担上项规定时，亦可由劳资双方协议酌量减低之，但若干工厂劳资双方原有另外协议的不在此例，仍照旧办理；各厂所欠职工的薪资及年终馈送，各厂除主要开支外，必须尽量提前补发；为了减轻资方负担，凡挂名领薪之人员一律截止。原有职工之福利如资方有力负担者，尽量照给，无力负担者经劳资双方协议减免。（二）为了减轻厂方的开支，职工可以轮流回家去住，住家时间以一个月到两个月为限，往来路费由资方负担；住家职工仍领前述最低生活费用；如本厂生产情况好转或恢复正常时，资方即以挂号信召回复工，职工须于接到通知后十日内回厂，过期不到即按自愿告退论，另雇职工（如有特殊情形者须以书面请假）。（三）为了维护营业，各厂应由劳资双方协议固定以下人员：经理、技师、会计、业务、外务、厨师、整理、工会负责人，以便管理业务和进行工会的工作；固定人员的薪资不论该厂生产与否，一律暂以半薪发给之，按生产量计算超过半薪时，则按实有生产量计发之；但工会负责人的工资与一般职工相同。（四）上述临时协议，待厂内生产好转时任何一方可以提出废止，但须经劳资双方协议呈请劳动局批准后方可生效。
