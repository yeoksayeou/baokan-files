Two Cases of Cadre Work Style Problems

Fengtai's 15th District Group of Farmers Criticizes Undemocratic Work Style of Agricultural Association Cadres

To the Editor:

The person in charge of the Agricultural Association in the 15th administrative village of Fengtai's 15th District not only fails to unite the villagers but also engages in bullying and corruption. We are angry but dare not speak out. Everyone requests a general meeting, but it has not been held yet, and those who dare to speak are afraid. We want to ask the higher authorities to investigate and report to the district, but we cannot see the district chief. Here are some facts: (1) In the last quarter's cart donation, a fine of 13,000 yuan was imposed for paying one day late. This matter can be investigated in detail with Chen Yongcai, Huang Guihua, Sun Weisheng, and others in the village. (2) More than 900 catties of public grain left over from last year are missing. (3) Li, an elderly poor woman from Yingtou Village, has five children. She was allocated two earthen houses during the land reform, but one house was taken back for no reason. Is this right? Her family's old lady asked in the district, but no result was obtained. After the land reform, we only hope that the cadres will be open in everything and hold regular meetings to give everyone a chance to speak. But they do not handle matters openly. (4) Finally, there is also a question of whether military dependents should be taken care of?

Editor's Note: This letter does not include the names of the writers, perhaps because the writers have some concerns. However, the situation they have reported deserves attention. We hope that the Fengtai 15th District Office will investigate and inform us of the results.

　　两起干部作风问题
　　丰台第十五区一群农民批评农会干部不民主作风编辑同志：
    丰台十五区十五行政村农会负责人，不但不团结村人，反有欺压贪污行为。我们敢怒而不敢言。大家要求开大会，但至今未开，敢说话的人都表示害怕。我们要请上级调查，向区里反映，但是看不到区长。下面是几件事实：（一）本年上季车捐，过一天交款就要罚一万三千元，这件事可向该村的陈永才、黄贵华，孙维生等详细调查。（二）去年所缴公粮余下九百余斤，不知下落。（三）营头村贫农李老太太，她有五个孩子，在土地改革时分得土房两间，但后来又无缘无故被抽回一间，这是对的吗？他们家里老太太到区里问，也未得到结果。我们在土地改革后，只希望干部们事事公开，常开个会，让大家有说话机会。可是他们办事都不公开。（四）最后还有一个问题，就是对于军属是否应该照顾呢？

    编者按：这封信没有写信人的名字，可能是写信人有什么顾虑。但是，他们所反映的情况是值得注意的，望丰台十五区区公所检查后告诉我们。
