Xinhua News Agency, May 29th: The National Flood Control Conference convened by the Ministry of Water Resources of the Central People's Government has requested that, under the same flood conditions as last year, 70 million mu of the 100 million mu of cultivated land flooded last year be protected from flooding this year. This conference opened on May 15th and closed on May 23rd.

　　Based on reports from representatives from various regions, the conference preliminarily reviewed this year's repair and defense projects and stipulated the guiding principles and tasks for this year's flood control work. The conference stipulated that flood control in various regions this year must be based on local administrative organs as the main body, establish unified flood control institutions, take into account both upstream and downstream, support each other on the left and right banks, rely on the strength of the masses, and carry out defense in sections, in order to overcome floods, ensure the safety of farmland, and achieve the goal of restoring and developing agricultural production. According to the above principles and working principles, the conference requested that water conservancy workers of people's governments in various regions continue to carry forward the fine style of unlimited loyalty to the people's cause, in order to be able to lead the people in unremitting struggle against floods under any serious circumstances. At the same time, in order to determine the minimum responsibility for flood control work in various regions, the conference, based on the different characteristics of various regions and rivers and the facilities of their flood control projects, made the following regulations for the safety guarantee of various rivers this year: The goal of flood control on the Yellow River is to defend against floods greater than those of 1949. Under normal circumstances, it is guaranteed that no breaches will occur when the flow rate at Shanzhou reaches 17,000 cubic meters per second; the Yangtze River main dike is guaranteed not to breach under the highest flood level in 1949, and efforts should be made to ensure that no breaches occur under the highest flood level in 1931 (of which the Gangma dike section west of Anqing, because the flood level in 1949 was higher than the flood level in 1931, it is guaranteed that no breaches will occur under the flood level in 1931, and efforts should be made to ensure that no breaches occur under the highest flood level in 1949); the Huai River, except for the two sections above Zhengyangguan and below Wuhe, is guaranteed not to breach at 1.5 meters above the highest flood level in 1949, and the rest are guaranteed not to breach under the highest flood level in 1931; the Han River is guaranteed to be safe when the flow rate at Nianpanshan is 12,000 cubic meters per second; the Pearl River is guaranteed not to breach under the highest flood level since hydrological records began. In addition, the conference also made specific regulations on the requirements for flood control projects for the coastal dikes in East China and other rivers, the rivers and lake embankments in the Central and Southern China region, and the rivers in Northeast China and North China. The realization of the above regulations will enable 70 million mu of the 100 million mu of disaster-stricken land last year to be free from flooding under the same flood conditions as last year. In other areas, due to excessively large projects that cannot be completed in one year, or due to improper arrangements for embankment restoration and drainage projects, and failure to solve the problem of rain and water accumulation, it is still necessary to strive to rescue with various artificial methods.

　　In order to complete the above tasks, the meeting also discussed the organizational leadership of flood control work. The conference decided that the flood control headquarters of the major administrative regions and provinces should be led by the administrative heads of various regions, and the flood control organs below the provincial level should specially set up political commissars to ensure the completion of flood control tasks. The conference also made clear regulations on the relationship between water conservancy organs in various river basins and local authorities, as well as the organization of joint defense institutions by two or more regions or provinces. In addition, the conference also decided to widely establish flood reporting stations throughout the country, strengthen telecommunications links between upstream and downstream, and grasp changes in water conditions in order to prepare for flood control.

　　去年被淹的一亿亩耕地中
    要保证七千万亩免受水灾
    全国防汛会议规定各地今年防汛任务
    【新华社二十九日讯】中央人民政府水利部召开的全国防汛会议，要求今年在与去年同样的洪水条件下，要使去年被淹的一亿亩耕地中的七千万亩免受水灾。这个会议系于五月十五日开幕，二十三日闭幕。
    会议根据各地代表的报告，初步地检讨了今年的修防工程，规定了今年防汛工作的方针和任务。会议规定：今年各地防汛必须以地方行政机关为主体，建立统一的防汛机构，上下游统筹兼顾，左右岸互相支援，依靠群众力量，分段进行防守，以期战胜洪水，保障农田安全，达到恢复与发展农业生产的目的。根据上述的方针和工作原则，会议要求各地人民政府水利工作人员继续发扬对人民事业无限忠诚的优良作风，以求在任何严重情况下都能领导人民对洪水作坚持不懈的斗争。同时为了确定各地防汛工作最低限度的责任，会议根据各地区、各河流不同的特点及其防洪工程的设施情况，对今年各河流的安全保证作了如下的规定：黄河防汛以防御比一九四九年更大的洪水为目标，在一般情况下，保证陕州流量达到一万七千秒立方公尺时不发生溃决；长江干堤保证在一九四九年最高洪水位下不发生溃决，争取在一九三一年最高洪水位下不发生溃决（其中安庆以西的冈马堤段，因该段一九四九年洪水位高于一九三一年洪水位，故保证在一九三一年洪水位下不发生溃决，争取在一九四九年最高洪水位下不发生溃决）；淮河除正阳关以上与五河以下两段保证在一九四九年最高洪水位以上一点五公尺不发生溃决外，其余都保证在一九三一年最高洪水位下不发生溃决；汉水保证在碾盘山流量一万二千秒立方公尺不出险；珠江保证在自有水文纪录以来的最高洪水位下不发生溃决。此外，会议对华东海塘及其他河流，中南区各河、湖堤垸，东北、华北等各河流的防汛工程的要求也分别作了具体的规定。以上规定的实现，将使去年一亿亩被灾土地中之七千万亩土地，在发生与去年同样洪水的条件下可免遭水灾。其他地区因工程过大，非一年所能完成，或因复堤与排水工程布置不当，雨涝积水问题未能解决，因此尚须利用各种人工方法努力抢救。
    为了完成以上的任务，会上并讨论了防汛工作的组织领导问题。会议决定各大行政区及省的防汛指挥部由各地行政首长负责领导，省以下防汛指挥机关专设政治委员，以保证防汛任务的完成。会议对各流域水利机关与地方的关系，以及两个以上地区或省区组织联防机构的问题，也都作了明白的规定。此外，会议并决定在全国各地广泛建立报汛站，加强上下游电信联系，掌握水情的变化，以作防汛的准备。
