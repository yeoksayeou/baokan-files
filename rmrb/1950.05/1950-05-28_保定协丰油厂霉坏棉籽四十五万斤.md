　　Baoding Xie Feng Oil Factory's 450,000 Jin of Moldy Cottonseed
To the Editor:
    At a time when the government is repeatedly calling for production savings and cherishing state property, a serious incident of cottonseed spoilage has occurred at the Baoding Xie Feng Oil Factory (a factory run by a government organ). Last November, Xie Feng Oil Factory purchased a large quantity of cottonseed. At that time, the factory did not set up a warehouse and stored 1.5 million jin of cottonseed in an open courtyard. With the rise of yang energy in the spring and increased rainfall, the factory's leaders did not actively carry out inspections or sun-drying. In early April, it was discovered that 450,000 jin of cottonseed had become moldy. It is estimated that each 100 jin of cottonseed will yield 4 jin less oil, for a total loss of 18,000 jin of oil from the 450,000 jin of cottonseed. If each jin of oil is valued at 2,400 yuan, the loss amounts to 43.2 million yuan.
    After this incident occurred, the factory did not report it to the municipal government or the Production and Savings Guidance Committee. It was not until a work team arrived at the factory on May 6th to inspect the work that the matter was discovered. The Production and Savings Guidance Committee immediately urged the factory by telephone to conduct a self-criticism and submit a written report. However, it was not until the 11th that the factory wrote a report on the amount of the loss, which also cited many objective reasons and did not include a self-criticism.
    The factory's leading cadres should bear full responsibility for this loss. It is extremely inappropriate to only cite objective reasons and not conduct a deep self-criticism. It is recommended that the government conduct a thorough investigation and take appropriate action.

### 保定协丰油厂霉坏棉籽四十五万斤

　　保定协丰油厂霉坏棉籽四十五万斤编辑同志：
    当政府再三号召生产节约、爱护国家资财的时候，保定协丰油厂（机关生产）竟发生霉坏棉籽的严重事件。去年十一月，协丰油厂购买了大批棉籽。当时该厂不设置仓库，把一百五十万斤棉籽存在露天院里。到了春天阳气上升，雨水较多，该厂领导干部又没积极进行检查、摊晒。四月初发觉四十五万斤棉籽发了霉。估计每百斤棉籽要少出油四斤，四十五万斤棉籽共少出油一万八千斤。如每斤油以二千四百元计，即损失四千三百二十万元。
    这个事情发生以后，该厂并未向市政府和生产节约指导委员会报告。五月六日工作组到该厂检查工作才查出来。生产节约指导委员会，立时用电话督促该厂作检讨并作书面报告。但迟至十一日该厂才写了一个损失数字报告，还说了好多客观原因，未作检讨。
    这个损失，该厂领导干部应负完全责任。光说客观原因，不做深刻检讨，是极不妥当的。建议政府进行深入调查，并给予适当处理。
