　　Reactionary Slander Plot Fails
　　Cuban Communist Leader Acquitted
    [Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 12th] According to a report from the Dian Tong News Agency in Havana: The members of the National Committee of the Cuban People's Socialist Party (i.e., the Communist Party), including General Secretary Roca, were acquitted in a trial on May 4th. They had been accused of plotting to overthrow the Cuban government by violence and sabotage propaganda. This trial began more than a year ago, but was adjourned until recently. On May 4th, after the "official investigator" presented his report, the prosecutor immediately withdrew the charges and requested that the defendants be acquitted. After deliberation, the court pronounced them innocent. Given the now even more frenzied anti-communist hysteria of the Cuban government and reactionary newspapers, this great victory of the people, immediately following the passionate May Day demonstrations, is of particular significance.
    An editorial in the "Hoy" newspaper, the organ of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, declared, "The outcome of this trial is a blow to the slanderers and enemies of the people, to imperialism, and to professional anti-communist hysteria peddlers." The editorial stated that the outcome of the trial was due to the sharp struggle waged by the working people to defend constitutional and political rights.

　　反动派诽谤阴谋失败
　　古共领袖无罪开释
    【新华社十二日讯】据电通社哈瓦那讯：古巴人民社会党（即共产党）全国委员会的委员们，包括总书记罗加在内，在五月四日的一次审讯中无罪开释。他们曾被控阴谋以暴力及破坏宣传等推翻古巴政府。这次审讯开始于一年多以前，然而一直休庭未审，直至不久以前才最后复庭。五月四日，在“官方调查员”提出他的报告后，检察官立即撤回控告，要求宣判被告无罪开释。法庭审议后，宣判无罪开释。鉴于现在古巴政府与反动报纸的反共歇斯底里之更为狂烈，这一次紧接在五一节激昂的示威之后的人民的伟大胜利，是具有特别的意义。
    古巴人民社会党机关报呼声报的社论宣称，“这次审讯的结果，对于诽谤者和人民的敌人，对于帝国主义以及对于职业的反共歇斯底里贩子，是一个打击。”社论称，审讯之所以有这样的结果，是由于劳动人民为了维护宪法与政治权利而进行的尖锐斗争。
