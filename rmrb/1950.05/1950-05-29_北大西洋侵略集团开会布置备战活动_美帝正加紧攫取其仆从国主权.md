Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: Following the meetings of the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France, the North Atlantic Aggression Group held its fourth meeting of its highest body – the Council composed of the foreign ministers of twelve countries – in London from May 15th to 18th. The meeting actively deployed military and financial-economic war preparations, decided to concentrate efforts on establishing a war system including a "collective army," and established a permanent body to centrally command all war preparations of the North Atlantic Group. The meeting showed that the United States is further controlling the North Atlantic Aggression Group, seizing more military and economic sovereignty from its puppet states.

Establishing a "Collective Army" According to US Imperialist War Plans

The communiqué issued at the end of the meeting declared that the so-called "defensive" war plan has been drafted, and the next step is to "take further measures in common defense, financial burden-sharing, and reorganization and expansion of necessary forces, so as to put these plans into practice." The communiqué issued at the end of the Council's last meeting on the same day announced that the Council decided to urge the governments of member states to "concentrate efforts on establishing a balanced collective army, while also considering the need to dispatch national troops outside the North Atlantic region out of obligation." The so-called "balanced collective army," according to the Associated Press, means that countries "should abandon their strict army, navy, and air force," and "merge and specialize their armed forces" "in order to promote a combat force in which each country participates separately according to its strengths." Therefore, this plan also means that the armies of Western European countries will be completely organized according to the US plan, and the plan that the United States has been clamoring for a long time is that the main task of Western European countries is to supply the army, while the United States is responsible for the air force and navy. This is a vicious plan to drive the people of Western Europe to be cannon fodder for US imperialism.

The communiqué also declared that not only military forces but also "necessary financial expenses should be studied as a whole, not as separate issues." The declaration issued by the meeting regarding the European Economic Cooperation Bureau inviting the United States and Canada to establish working relations with it further pointed out that the United States will directly control the entire Western European economy to realize its plan for Western European economic "integration." The communiqué announced that the North Atlantic Treaty Council has decided to establish a shipping planning committee to uniformly plan merchant shipping under its war plan.

Establishing a Permanent Body to Command War Preparations

In order to accelerate the implementation of the war plan, the meeting decided to establish a permanent body in London to centrally command all war preparations of the North Atlantic Group during the recess of the Council. This body is composed of one representative of the foreign minister from each contracting country, and one of them is elected to serve as the chairman with broad decision-making power. The communiqué indicated that the tasks of the permanent body are: (1) to study the interrelationships of various war preparation plans; to ensure the coordinated action of various agencies; (2) to make recommendations to the relevant governments in order to realize the war plan of the so-called "defensive plan"; (3) to exchange views on political affairs of common concern; (4) to plan war propaganda to so-called "elucidate the purposes of the treaty"; (5) to direct the implementation of the Marshall Plan. According to reports from the Associated Press and the Associated Press, the chairman of this body has been internally designated as an American.

The composition of this body places the North Atlantic Group under the jurisdiction of a "war cabinet" directly manipulated by the United States. Using this "cabinet," the United States will be able to arbitrarily seize the sovereignty of Western European countries, including the right of national defense, which is the most important symbol of national sovereignty, in order to realize its war preparation plan. Even the Associated Press does not deny this fact, pointing out that the above-mentioned "largest military plan in peacetime" "requires the contracting countries to make the largest sacrifice of national sovereignty in peacetime in history."

Meeting Filled with Difficulties; US Imperialism and its Puppet States Quarrel Over Military Spending Issues Remain Unresolved

However, the process and results of the meeting further exposed the contradictions within the aggressive bloc, primarily between the United States and other countries. A Reuters dispatch on the 16th quoted talks from people participating in the meeting, revealing the quarreling situation, saying: "Acheson played a dominant role in the discussions," "He was sometimes very agitated." "Everyone was talking a lot when exchanging opinions, and few foreign ministers were willing to end their tendency to only talk about their own problems."

The main focus of the quarrel between the United States and Western European governments at the meeting was who should bear the huge military expenditure proposed by the US's frantic war preparation plan. According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 16th: "The United States insisted that the defense plan could be expanded without harming the economic recovery of various countries, but the European countries tend to believe that the United States must fund the expansion of defense expenditures." The Associated Press further pointed out: "Acheson urged the West to conduct a 'total cold war,' which would cost billions of dollars, while the main purpose of Western European countries – especially Britain – was to try to make up for their dollar deficit."

The results of the meeting show that the issue of who should bear military spending has not been resolved. French Foreign Minister Schuman publicly admitted after the meeting that "the issue of military spending for the countries of the North Atlantic Treaty has not been resolved," and can only be continued by the representatives of the foreign ministers.

Therefore, although the meeting was full of frenzied war clamor, from beginning to end, it was also in an atmosphere of unhideable gloom. An Associated Press dispatch on the 16th reported: At the first day of the Council meeting, when reviewing the world situation, "the result of the discussion was not very good, and everyone agreed that the West has been gradually declining in the Cold War." After the close of the meeting, an Associated Press dispatch on the 20th also admitted: "For the governments concerned, it is not easy to thoroughly implement the policies they have announced. They will sometimes face difficult choices: whether to increase taxes on their already angry people (obviously not just a matter of increasing taxes)? Or fulfill their promises to the treaty?" The New York Times, as a mouthpiece of US monopoly capital, also emphasized: "Before achieving the final goal, many difficulties must be eliminated."

### 北大西洋侵略集团开会布置备战活动  美帝正加紧攫取其仆从国主权

　　北大西洋侵略集团开会布置备战活动
    美帝正加紧攫取其仆从国主权
    【新华社二十五日讯】继美、英、法三国外长会议之后，北大西洋侵略集团又于五月十五日至十八日在伦敦举行其最高机构——由十二国外长参加的理事会的第四次会议。会议积极地布置了军事的和财政经济的备战活动，决定集中力量建立包括一支“集体军队”的战争系统，并成立集中指挥北大西洋集团一切备战活动的常设机构。会议显示，美国正进一步控制北大西洋侵略集团，攫取其仆从国家更多的军事的和经济的主权。
    按照美帝战争计划建立“集体军队”
    会议最后发表的公报宣称：所谓“防御”的战争计划已拟成，次一步骤是“在共同防务、财政分担、改编和扩充必要的军队方面，采取进一步的措施，从而使这些计划付诸实行”。同日该会最后一次会议结束时发表的公报宣布，理事会决定力促各会员国政府“集中力量建立均衡的集体军队，同时并考虑出于义务而派遣各国军队至北大西洋地区以外的需要”。所谓“均衡的集体军队”，据合众社解释，这就是说，各国“应废弃其严格的陆海空军”，而将其“武装部队合并并专业化”，“以求促成一支各国按其特长而分别参加的战斗部队”。因此，这一计划也就意味着西欧各国的军队将完全按照美国的计划编成，而美国方面喧嚷已久的计划就是：西欧各国主要任务是供给陆军，美国则担任空军和海军。这是一个驱使西欧人民为美帝国主义当炮灰的恶毒计划。
    公报还宣称：不仅军事力量而且“必需的财政费用事宜也应作为整个问题来研究，而不应作为分别问题来研究”。会议发表的关于欧洲经济合作局应邀请美国和加拿大与之建立工作关系的宣言，进一步指明了美国将直接控制整个西欧经济，以实现其西欧经济“整体化”的计划。公报宣布，北大西洋公约理事会已决定成立一航运计划委员会，统一筹划在其战争计划下的商船航运。
    设立常设机构指挥备战活动
    为加紧执行战争计划，会议决定在伦敦设立在理事会休会期间集中指挥北大西洋集团一切备战活动的常设机构，这一机构由缔约国各派外长代表一人组成，而选举其中一人担任具有广泛决定权力的主席。公报指明，常设机构的任务为：（一）研究各种备战计划的相互关系；保证各种机构的配合行动；（二）向各有关政府提出意见，以求实现所谓“防御计划”的战争计划；（三）对共同有关的政治性事务交换意见；（四）策划所谓“阐扬公约目的”的战争宣传；（五）指挥马歇尔计划之进行。据合众社和美联社的透露，这一机构的主席已内定为美人。
    这一机构的组成，使北大西洋集团置于一个由美国直接操纵的“战争内阁”的管辖下。利用这个“内阁”，美国将可以任意地攫取西欧各国的主权，甚至包括作为国家主权最主要标志的国防权在内，以实现其备战计划。这种事实连合众社也不否认，该社指出：上述“平时最大的军事计划”，“要求各缔约国作历史上和平时期最大一次的牺牲国家主权”。
    会议充满困难美帝与其仆从国争吵军费问题未获得解决
    但是，会议的进程与结果，也进一步地暴露了侵略集团内部首先是美国与其他各国的矛盾。路透社十六日电曾引参加会议人士的谈话，透露会中争吵的情形称：“艾奇逊在讨论时扮演着支配的角色”，“他有时意气至为激动”。“大家在交换意见时议论纷纷，很少外长愿意结束他们只谈自身问题的倾向”。
    美国与西欧各国政府在会上争吵的主要焦点，是由谁来负担美国疯狂备战计划所提出的庞大军费的问题。据合众社十六日电透露：“美国坚持防御计划可以扩充而无害于各国的经济恢复，但是，欧洲国家却都倾向于美国必须资助扩充防务用款的意见。”合众社更指出：“艾奇逊敦促西方一定要进行‘总体冷战’，这就要花费几十亿美元，而西欧各国——特别是英国的主要目的，却是想要设法弥补其美元亏空。”
    会议结果表明，由谁来负担军费的问题没有得到解决。法国外长舒曼在会后公开承认“北大西洋公约各国军费问题尚未解决”，只能由外长代表们去继续研究。
    因此，会议虽然充满了备战的疯狂叫嚣，然而，从开幕到闭幕，却同时处在不可掩盖的阴郁的气氛中。合众社十六日电报道：理事会的第一日会议，在检讨世界局势时，“讨论的结果并不很好，全体一致认为，西方已在冷战中渐呈颓势”。在会议闭幕之后，美联社二十日电也承认：“对于有关各国政府来说，彻底执行它们所宣布的政策，实在并非容易，它们有时将要面临困难的抉择：是对它们已经愤怒的人民增加税收（显然不仅仅是增加税收问题）呢？还是履行它们对公约的诺言呢？”作为美国独占资本喉舌的纽约时报也强调：“在获致最后目的之前，尚须肃清许多困难。”
