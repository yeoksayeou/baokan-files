Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 6th: The Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic has issued a proclamation to the German people on the anniversary of Germany's liberation (May 8th).

The proclamation begins by mentioning that five years ago, on May 8, 1945, the victorious Soviet army crushed the fascist terror, the regime of war and destruction. A new era for Germany began. From then on, the German people had the opportunity to gain the respect of all nations and ensure a better future for all the people in a peaceful and democratic manner.

The proclamation states: The German people were not liberated from fascism by their own strength. It was the army of the socialist Soviet Union that defeated the fascist dictatorship and shattered the chains that bound the German people.

The proclamation points out: Today, the German Democratic Republic is a vast construction site. The German people are striving to build a peaceful homeland. In the German Democratic Republic, working people have taken control of their own destiny; they cultivate their own land and manage their publicly owned factories and mines.

The proclamation then points out: Contrary to the Soviet Union's policy aimed at maintaining peace and the national independence of all countries, the American and British occupying authorities in West Germany are pursuing the war policy of imperialist bandits. They have betrayed and continue to betray the solemn obligations they undertook at Potsdam. They have divided Germany in order to turn western Germany into a war camp and a military springboard. They want to turn German youth into cannon fodder for Anglo-American imperialism. The threat to the freedom of our people and to the survival of our nation has re-emerged.

The proclamation then calls on all German people to recognize the great significance of the anniversary of the Soviet army's liberation of Germany from fascist bondage, and points out that the Potsdam decisions have given the German people the opportunity to live in a new way. As long as the German people's efforts are correctly directed towards implementing the principles of this decision, they will successfully establish a united, democratic, and progressive Germany, and take their place among the free and peace-loving nations of the world. To this end, the German people must resolutely participate in the peace camp, not allow new wars to hinder the completion of their democratic construction, and use their own strength to build a prosperous and thriving life.

The proclamation concludes: "Join the ranks of the National Front of Democratic Germany! Fight for the unification of our motherland! Fight for a just peace! Fight for a firm friendship with the Soviet Union! Fight for world peace!"

The proclamation was signed by Otto Grotewohl, Prime Minister of the Provisional Government of the German Democratic Republic, and all Deputy Prime Ministers and Ministers.

    号召为德国统一与世界和平奋斗
    【新华社八日讯】塔斯社柏林六日讯：德意志民主共和国临时政府顷为德国解放纪念日（五月八日）发表告德国人民书。
    告人民书首先提到在五年以前，在一九四五年五月八日，胜利的苏军粉碎了法西斯的恐怖，战争与毁灭的政权。德国的新时代开始了。德国人民从此有了可能用和平民主的方式获得各国人民的尊重并且确保全国人民获得较好的未来。
    告人民书称：德国人民并不是凭他们自己的力量从法西斯主义之下解放出来的。打垮了法西斯独裁制度并且粉碎了束缚着德国人民的锁链的，是社会主义苏联的军队。

    告人民书于是号召全体德国人民认识苏军使德国从法西斯羁绊下获得解放的纪念日的重大意义，并指出波茨坦的决定已使德国人民有机会按照新的途径而生活，只要德国人民的努力很正确地以实现这个决定的原则为方针，他们就将顺利的建立一个统一的、民主的和进步的德国，而在全世界自由的、爱好和平的各国人民中间取得自己的地位。为此，德国人民必须坚决参加和平阵营，不让新战争阻挠他们的民主建设的完成，并用自己的力量来建立繁昌荣盛的生活。
    告人民书最后号召：“加入民主德国全国阵线的队伍！为我们祖国的统一而奋斗！为公正的和约而奋斗！为了与苏联确实友好而奋斗！为世界和平而奋斗！”
