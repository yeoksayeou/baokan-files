Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch: To finalize concrete steps for implementing the so-called "Atlantic Supreme Council" proposed by French Prime Minister Bidault under US instruction, at the upcoming US-UK-France Foreign Ministers' meeting, and to actively promote so-called "total diplomacy," the US ruling group has recently dispatched its senior spokesmen to clamor for the reorganization of the United Nations and the establishment of a global aggressive bloc outside the UN.

According to a Washington dispatch from the US Information Service, the leading reactionary politician of the US Republican Party, former President Hoover, delivered a speech at the advertising department meeting of the American Newspaper Publishers Association in New York on April 28, openly declaring: "The United Nations should be reorganized, without the participation of communist countries." However, Hoover seemed to know that this wishful thinking would not be so smooth under the strong pressure of world people demanding international friendly cooperation, and therefore continued: "If this is not practically feasible, then a clearly defined new united front should be organized by countries that do not approve of communism, maintain morality and religion, and love freedom." Hoover attempted to use this front to unify and control its vassal states in the US, thereby strengthening its aggressive forces. Hoover admitted: "The proposal I put forward is really a logical and practical way to implement total diplomacy."

On the same day that Hoover delivered his speech, US State Department Republican policy advisor Dulles, speaking at the American International Law Association, openly declared that "the United Nations Charter and its membership regulations are no longer suitable" and demanded a review of the United Nations Charter.

All these unscrupulous remarks, a Reuter's dispatch on April 28 pointed out, showed that "the primary goal of the United States' current total diplomacy is to dissolve the United Nations and replace it with a new organization based on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Atlantic Supreme Peace Conference, originally proposed by Bidault under US instruction, is developing into an all-encompassing tool to realize the aggressive military conspiracy of American strategists."

The reaction of US official figures to Hoover's speech clearly exposed this conspiracy. Many members of Congress expressed their support for Hoover's proposal, adding momentum to the US's actions to undermine the United Nations, while senior officials, though reluctant to avoid Hoover's proposal to exclude the Soviet Union and people's democracies from the United Nations, all expressed agreement with Hoover's spirit. US President Truman, at a press conference on May 3, said that he would continue to "support" the current United Nations, but as early as when he heard the broadcast of Hoover's speech, he immediately called Hoover to express his appreciation, telling Hoover that he had been advocating "moral mobilization" for a long time and that he was very happy that "Hoover was saying exactly what he was doing." Other official figures, including Dulles, Assistant Secretary of State for United Nations Affairs Hickson, US Deputy Chief Representative to the United Nations Gross, and Representative Roosevelt, all stated that "it is not yet necessary to abolish the universality of the United Nations," but according to Dulles, they believed: "As long as a more closely united alliance is formed, anything we want to do can be accomplished within the charter system." Because, according to Dulles and his ilk, all aggressive institutions such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which directly violate the United Nations Charter, are considered to be within the charter system.

However, this arrogant plan of US imperialism, as Reuter's pointed out: "is just a rehash of its old dreams, and its sudden appearance today only shows that the US government has to urgently engage in it due to the development of the domestic economic crisis, the intensification of contradictions within the imperialist camp, and especially due to the strength of the peace camp."

　　震慑于和平阵营的强大
    美帝阴谋破坏联合国       
    命令反动政客出面叫嚣“改组”  图谋成立世界性的侵略集团
    【新华社六日讯】为了想要在行将举行的美、英、法三外长会议上拟定具体实行法国总理皮杜尔前在美国授意下提出的所谓“大西洋最高会议”的步骤，以积极推行所谓“总体外交”，美国统治集团最近又接连派遣其高级代言人出来叫嚣改组联合国，并在联合国以外成立世界性的侵略集团。
    据美国新闻处华盛顿讯，美国共和党头号反动政客、前总统胡佛，于四月二十八日在纽约美国报纸发行人协会广告部会议上发表演说，公然声称：“联合国应该改组，不要共产党国家参加。”但是胡佛似乎也知道这一如意算盘在世界人民要求国际友好合作的强大压力下并不那么如意，因此接着又说：“如果这一点实际上行不通，那么便应该由不赞成共产主义、维护道义与宗教及爱好自由的国家组织一个皂白分明的新的联合阵线。”胡佛企图利用这一阵线使美国统一管制其附庸国，以此加强其侵略力量。胡佛承认：“我提出的建议实在是总体外交的合乎逻辑与切实可行的办法。”
    在胡佛发表演说同日，美国国务院的共和党政策顾问杜勒斯，在美国国际法协会演说时竟公然声称“联合国的宪章及其会员资格的规定均已不合时宜”，而要求重行审查联合国宪章。
    所有这些肆无忌惮的言论，电通社四月二十八日电指出，都表明“美国目前总体外交的首要目标乃是使联合国解体，而代之以用北大西洋机构为基础的新组织。原来由皮杜尔在美国授意下提出的大西洋最高和平会议，正在发展成一个囊括一切的工具，以实现美国策士的侵略军事阴谋。”
    美国官方人物对胡佛演说的反应明白地暴露了这种阴谋。许多议员表示赞成胡佛建议，为美国破坏联合国的行动助威，而高级的官方人物虽然忸怩地避开胡佛演说中关于把苏联及人民民主国家排除出联合国的主张，却都表示同意胡佛的精神。美国总统杜鲁门在五月三日记者招待会上表示还要“支持”目前的联合国，但早在他听完胡佛演说的广播时，就立即打电话给胡佛表示嘉许，告诉胡佛他很久以来即提倡“道德动员”，他很高兴“胡佛所说的正是他所做的”。其他官方人物包括杜勒斯，负责联合国事务的助理国务卿希克逊，美国驻联合国副首席代表葛罗斯与代表罗斯福夫人，都表示“取消联合国的普遍性尚无必要”，但是据杜勒斯说，他们相信：“只要组成一个团结得更紧密的同盟，我们要做的任何事情都可以在宪章体系之内完成。”因为据杜勒斯之辈看来，所有直接违反联合国宪章的诸如北大西洋公约之类的侵略机构，都算是宪章体系以内的东西。
    但是美帝国主义这一狂妄计划，如电通社指出：“只是其旧梦的重温，它在今日的突然出现，只是显示了美国政府由于国内经济危机的发展，帝国主义阵营内部矛盾的加剧，特别是由于和平阵营的强大而不得不急切从事。”
