　　Tenth District Tongxinglong Foreign Goods Store
　　Employees Promote Capitalists to Maintain Business

　　[This newspaper reports] Employees of the privately-owned Tongxinglong Foreign Goods Store in the Tenth District, with their hard work, have prompted the capitalists to change their passive idea of closing down the business. Now, labor and capital are working together to develop the business. The store's manager, Chen Shoushan, did not understand the policies of the People's Government well in the past, restricted employees from joining the trade union, and the wage regulations were extremely unreasonable. On March 13th of this year, Gao Shixin, an employee of the store, voluntarily went to the trade union to apply for membership and said that he had been an employee of Tongxinglong for six or seven years before liberation, and his annual salary was only enough to buy a few pairs of socks, besides food. The store made a lot of money last year, but the manager, under the pretext of "losing money in business," canceled the employees' year-end bonus and decided to completely suspend the monthly salary for 1950. The manager bought a house last year and was found by the government to have evaded taxes by making false accounts, with a fine of more than seven million yuan. These were entirely paid from the store's expenses. The living expenses of the manager's family also came entirely from the store. This is extremely unreasonable. After learning about these situations, the Tenth District branch of the Department Store Trade Union sent personnel to explain the policy of mutual benefit for labor and capital to the manager in detail, pointing out that stopping salary payments was unreasonable, and suggested that labor and capital should negotiate a solution based on the actual business situation. After the manager agreed, he invited members of the Tenth District Trade Union branch to participate in the consultation on March 15th, and jointly agreed that the highest wage would be 150 jin of millet per month, and the lowest would be 75 jin of millet per month. After the wage adjustment, the employees' morale was boosted, and they worked hard. At the end of March, after settling accounts, the net profit was equivalent to 2,400 jin of millet, excluding living expenses. But at this time, the manager still held a negative attitude. In mid-April, the manager found the trade union twice in succession, proposing that business was bad and he wanted to close down. He also said that he was old and wanted to withdraw 6 million yuan (one-third of the capital) as personal pocket money for the future. He also deceived the employees by saying, "Business is getting worse every day, and taxes will gradually increase in the future. It is better to close down as soon as possible, and everyone can share something." Under the leadership and education of the trade union, the employees reasoned with the manager with facts and continued to work enthusiastically as before. The manager's confused thinking gradually cleared up, and now he comes to the store every day to discuss with the employees how to develop the business.

　　十区同兴隆洋货庄
　  店员推动资方维持营业
    【本报讯】十区私营同兴隆洋货庄店员，以努力工作的事实，推动资方改变了企图歇业的消极思想，现劳资双方正同心协力，开展业务。该号经理陈寿山，过去对人民政府的政策了解不够，限制店员加入工会，工资规定也极不合理。今年三月十三日，该号店员高世鑫自动跑到工会要求入会，并且说，解放前他在同兴隆当了六、七年店员，除管吃外，每年的工资不过买几双袜子。该号去年赚钱不少，但经理却以“买卖赔钱”为借口，取消了店员的年终分红，并决定完全停止一九五○年的月薪。该经理去年买了房子一所，还因做假账漏税，被政府查出；罚款七百多万元。这些完全由柜上开支。经理一家的生活费用，也完全出于柜上。这是极不合理的。百货业工会第十区分会了解了这些情形，即派员向该经理详细解释劳资两利的政策，说明停薪是不合理的，并向他建议，由劳资双方按实际营业情况协商解决。该经理同意后，于三月十五日请十区工会分会委员参加协商，共同议定工资最高小米一百五十斤，最低每月小米七十五斤。工资调整后，店员情绪提高，努力工作，三月底结账时，除去生活费用外，净获利润折合伏地小米二千四百斤。但这时经理仍抱着消极态度。四月中旬，该经理又先后两次找到工会，提出营业不好，想歇业。又说年纪已老，想抽资六百万元（占资金的三分之一），作为个人将来的零用费。他还欺骗店员说：“买卖一天不如一天，以后税收也逐渐加重，不如趁早歇业，大家还能分点东西。”店员们在工会领导、教育下，拿事实和经理说理，同时照旧热情工作。该经理的糊涂思想逐渐打通了，现在每天到柜上来，和店员共同研究，想法如何开展业务。
