Leading Cadres Neglect Production Due to Being Busy with Affairs
Automobile Company Suffers Serious Losses in the First Quarter
Now Establishing Systems to Improve Work
[Report from this newspaper] Reporter Lin Mo reports: The Beijing Automobile Company suffered serious losses in the first quarter. The company originally planned to break even this year, but the first quarter loss was equivalent to over 490,000 jin of millet. The situation improved slightly in April, but there was still a loss of over 80,000 jin of millet for the entire month.

In order to accommodate the difficulties of tricycle workers in the city who were changing jobs, the company had not dispatched all available vehicles for a long time, resulting in a significant loss of income. The company was reorganized from the former Kuomintang Beiping Public Bus Company, 320 Automobile Repair Factory, and Nanjing Public Bus Company, and lacked a solid foundation. These are all objective reasons for the company's losses within a certain period of time. However, the main reason is that there is a relatively serious style of bureaucracy and preoccupation with administrative affairs in the company's administrative leadership, which has failed to rely well on the workers and give play to the enthusiasm of the workers and staff. When the company formulated its annual plan, it did not deeply mobilize the employees to discuss it. Until now, the majority of workers are still unclear about the plan.

The work of the Party, the Trade Union, and the Communist Youth League in the company has not actually been established for a long time. Before March, manager Liu Xin concurrently served as the secretary of the Party branch, forming a situation where the Party and administration were not separated. In reality, the Party failed to play its due role. The trade union organization was just an empty shell. More than half of the trade union committee members were staff members. The trade union groups have not yet been properly organized. The trade union has not done enough in mobilizing workers for production, worker education, and worker welfare.

Borrowing Money, Asking for Leave, etc., All Have to Be Resolved by the Manager
A leading cadre of the company, who bears the main responsibility, is busy all day long, but the work is unplanned, and they grab everything, big and small. Workers asking for leave, borrowing money, and even family members arriving, all have to find the manager to resolve. Taking care of small matters, they neglect the big ones. For example, on Route 6 of the company, because the workers and the administration signed a collective contract, the driving efficiency has been significantly improved, surpassing other routes. This method should have been promoted quickly, but the administration did not pay attention to it. The leadership lacks thorough consideration and planning for the control and allocation of vehicles and the opening of routes. Vehicle allocation is chaotic, and the number of vehicles on each route fluctuates greatly. There is a lack of organic connection between the various departments within the company. Sometimes, when a vehicle runs out of fuel on the road, it calls the company for assistance, but the company fails to deliver it in time, forcing the vehicle to stop. The company lacks a fixed standard for driving speed; the driving intervals are uneven, and the time is inaccurate. The original regulation was that a bus would pass a stop every six to eight minutes, but sometimes several buses would pass in a row within the prescribed time, and sometimes there would be no bus for half an hour, causing great inconvenience to passengers. The company lacks a vehicle maintenance and repair system. Many vehicles are often repaired and often break down. The average vehicle operation rate is 56% of the vehicles in use, which seriously affects the normal number of vehicles dispatched and increases repair costs. There is a lack of a system for using materials. If something is broken, it is simply replaced without investigating the cause. There is also a great waste of fuel. Workers have expressed their opinions, saying, "Charcoal doesn't come from the wind, it's really hard for us to see it being wasted like this!"

Lack of Strict System, Great Waste of Materials
Abnormal driving reduces income. Considerable waste increases expenses, and losses are inevitable. The company originally planned that the income and expenditure for each passenger per kilometer would be 0.09 jin of millet; however, in the first quarter, the actual average income per person per kilometer was only 0.066 jin, while the expenditure was 0.1277 jin.

Paying Attention to Improvement, April Revenue Increases
The administrative leadership of the automobile company has begun to pay attention to correcting the above-mentioned serious situation. In order to clarify the division of labor and establish a system, detailed rules for handling affairs have been formulated for each section and department. The implementation of the vehicle maintenance and repair system is currently being stepped up. Based on the research and creativity of the employees, vehicles are now being continuously modified to replace charcoal or firewood with coal. This can greatly reduce fuel costs. The work of the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union has gradually begun to unfold. Driving time has been improved compared to before, and the number of passengers is gradually increasing, with more than 200,000 more passengers in April than in March. The loss in April decreased by 62% compared to March. In order to truly implement various systems and improvement plans, the leadership must earnestly implement the spirit of democratic management, carry out arduous work in a planned and step-by-step manner, inspire the enthusiasm of workers and staff, rely on the strength of the masses, and earnestly improve work.

### 领导干部忙于事务忽视生产  汽车公司第一季亏损严重  现正建立制度注意改进工作

　　领导干部忙于事务忽视生产
    汽车公司第一季亏损严重
    现正建立制度注意改进工作
    【本报讯】记者林沫报道：北京市汽车公司在第一季造成严重亏损。该公司今年原计划达到收支平衡，但第一季亏损折合小米四十九万余斤。四月份情况略有改进，全月仍亏损小米八万余斤。
    该公司为了照顾本市三轮车工人转业的困难，长期没有出足可出的车辆，使收入受到相当损失；该公司系由原国民党北平公共汽车公司，三二○汽车修理厂，及南京公共汽车公司等单位合并改组而成，工作缺乏基础；这些，都是该公司在一定时间内造成亏累的客观原因。但主要的，是该公司行政领导方面存在着相当严重的官僚主义与事务主义的作风，未能很好依靠工人，发挥工人、职员的积极性。该公司制订全年计划时，未深入发动职工讨论，直到现在，大多数工人对计划还不清楚。
    该公司党、工、团的工作，在很长时期内，实际上没有建立起来。在三月份以前，经理刘新兼任党支部书记，形成党政不分。实际上，党未能起其应有的作用。工会组织只是一个空架子，工会委员有半数以上是职员。工会小组至今尚未编好。工会对发动工人生产及工人教育、工人福利等，作的都很不够。
    借钱请假等事  都要经理解决
    该公司一部负主要责任的领导干部整日忙忙碌碌，但工作无计划，大小事一把抓。工人请假、借钱甚至来了家属，都要找经理解决。顾了小事，就忽视了大事。如该公司六路行车，因工人和行政签订了集体合同，行车效率显著提高，超过其他各路。此种办法理应迅速推广，但行政方面没有重视。领导方面对车辆的掌握、调配及路线的开辟，缺乏周密的考虑与计划。车辆调配混乱，每一线路的行车数忽多忽少。公司内各部门缺乏有机的联系，有时车子在外燃料中断，打电话向公司要，公司未能及时送到，被迫停车。该公司行车速度无一定标准；行车间隔不均匀，时间不准确。行车过站原规定六至八分钟一趟，但有时在规定时间内一连过几辆，有时半点钟没有车，乘客甚感不便。公司缺乏车辆保养和检修制度，很多车辆常修常坏，出车率平均为使用车辆的百分之五十六，严重影响了正常的出车数量，增加了修理费用的开支。使用材料缺乏制度，坏了就领，不考查原因。燃料也有很大的浪费现象。工人曾提出意见说：“木炭不是风刮来的，随便糟踏，我们心里实在难受！”
    缺乏严格制度  器材浪费很大
    行车不正常，减少了收入。浪费相当严重，增加了开支，亏累现象就不可避免了。该公司原计划每一乘客每一公里的收入和开支均为○·○九斤小米；但第一季平均每人每公里实际收入仅达○·○六六斤，开支则为○·一二七七斤。
    正在注意改进  四月收入增多
    汽车公司行政领导方面对上述严重情况，已开始注意改正。为了明确分工、建立制度，已制订了各科及各部门的办事细则。目前正抓紧推行车辆的保养、检修制度。根据职工的研究和创造，现正不断改装车辆，以石炭代替木炭或木柴。这样，可以大大减低燃料费用。党、团和工会工作已逐渐开展。行车时间已较前改进，乘客逐渐增多，四月份较三月份增加乘客二十多万。四月份亏损较三月份减少百分之六十二。要使各种制度与改进计划真正见诸实行，领导上必须认真贯彻民主管理的精神，有计划、有步骤地进行艰苦的工作，启发工人、职员的积极性，依靠群众的力量，认真改进工作。
