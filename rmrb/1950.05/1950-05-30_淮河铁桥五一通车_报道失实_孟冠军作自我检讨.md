Editor's Note: On April 14th, this newspaper published a message on the second page entitled "Striving for the Completion of the Huai River Iron Bridge by May 1st." This message was adapted from a contribution by Xu Zhiren of the Huai River Bridge Construction Team. The original draft stated, "Striving to open to traffic by May 1st." After consulting with the Bridge Engineering Department of the Ministry of Railways, we revised it to "Striving for completion by May 1st" when publishing.

[From Our Jinan Correspondent] Regarding the inaccurate report of the "Huai River Iron Bridge to Open to Traffic on May 1st," Meng Guanjun, Head of the Political Work Section of the Jinan Railway Administration Bridge Engineering Office, specifically sent a letter to this newspaper on the 20th to publicly conduct a self-criticism. The following is a summary of the original text:

　　During my time with the Huai River Bridge Construction Team, I was too hasty in my work. The comrades' efforts and the workers' high level of enthusiasm further boosted my confidence. However, I did not consider that underwater engineering and above-water engineering are fundamentally different. On March 31st, Deputy Director Zhao of the Jinan Bureau sent a letter instructing us to strive to have the Huai River Bridge open to traffic by "May 1st" as a gift from the working class to their own holiday. That evening, a meeting of cadres above the level of team leader (including engineering department worker cadres and technical workers) was convened to mobilize efforts. After discussion, cadres and workers unanimously expressed that they could guarantee the completion of the task, and a resolution to "Open to Traffic by May 1st" was passed at the meeting. In addition to reporting to the Jinan Bureau, Comrade Xu Zhiren was asked to write a draft about this matter and send it to the Wanbei Daily and the People's Daily for publication.

　　I myself do not understand technology and underestimated the arduousness and difficulties of the engineering task. Furthermore, I was overwhelmed by the workers' high enthusiasm, and therefore, blindly believed that opening to traffic by "May 1st" would not be a problem. Even when the water level had risen by more than ten meters and the project encountered serious difficulties, I still attempted to use political mobilization to urge the workers to work harder and guarantee "Opening to Traffic by May 1st."

　　Today, in retrospect, this error is serious. As criticized by the Bureau, this is an anarchic and undisciplined manifestation of liberalism, which resulted in deceiving the organization and deceiving the readers. Today, I make a special statement: I take full responsibility for all these errors. In addition to requesting punishment from the organization, I also apologize to the readers and resolve not to repeat such errors in the future.

### “淮河铁桥五一通车”报道失实  孟冠军作自我检讨

　　“淮河铁桥五一通车”报道失实
    孟冠军作自我检讨
    编者按：四月十四日，本报二版发表了“淮河铁桥争取五一竣工”的消息。这个消息是根据淮河桥工队徐智仁来稿改写的。该稿原文称：“争取五一通车”。我们和铁道部桥梁工程科商量后，在发表时改写“争取五一竣工”。
    【本报济南讯】关于“淮河铁桥五一通车”的消息报道失实一事，济南铁路管理局桥梁工程处政工科长孟冠军特于二十日致函本报，公开进行检讨。兹将原文摘要发表如下：
    我这次来到淮河桥工队，在工作中犯了急性病。同志们的努力，工人的高度积极性，更鼓舞了我的信心。但是，我没想到水下工程与水上工程是有着根本的不同。三月三十一日，济南局赵副局长来信，指示我们应争取淮河桥在“五一”通车，作为工人阶级向自己节日的献礼。当晚，召开班长以上干部会议（包括工程司工人干部及技术工人），进行动员。经过讨论，干部、工友一致表示可以保证完成任务，当在会上通过“五一通车”的决议。除向济南局报告外，还叫徐智仁同志写了关于这件事情的稿子，寄到皖北日报和人民日报发表。
    我自己不懂技术，对工程任务的艰巨和困难估计不足。又被工人的高度热情冲昏了头脑，因此，盲目地认为“五一”通车不成问题。直至水位已上涨十几米，工程发生了严重困难时，还企图以政治鼓动来督促工人加油，保证“五一通车”。
    今天检讨起来，这一错误是严重的。正如局方所批评的，这是无组织无纪律的自由主义现象，其结果是欺骗了组织，欺骗了读者。今天特作声明：这一切错误由我完全负责，除向组织请求处分外，并向读者道歉，决心今后不重犯这样的错误。
