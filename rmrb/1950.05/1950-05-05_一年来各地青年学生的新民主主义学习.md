New Democratic Studies of Young Students Across the Country in the Past Year

With the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution, the Chinese student movement has entered a completely new historical period. Before liberation, the main task of the Chinese student movement was to oppose the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China. After liberation, the task of student work shifted to uniting all students and striving to carry out new democratic studies.

　　The majority of students participated in holiday studies and social service activities.

　　Party members and Youth League members took the lead actively, and most students were able to study their regular courses seriously.

In the early days of liberation, student movements in various places experienced vigorous movement phases, which not only played a certain role in coordinating with the revolution, but also helped the progress of the majority of students. In the subsequent summer and winter vacations, the majority of students participated in activities such as study gardens, youth gardens, and youth lectures organized by the Youth League and student unions. According to incomplete statistics, 120,000 students in more than 50 large and medium-sized cities participated in summer studies, and the number of participants in winter vacation studies exceeded this number. Students in various places also appropriately participated in various social service activities according to their specific circumstances. For example, Shanghai students participated in publicity work for soliciting public bonds and anti-bombing efforts, Jinan students in Shandong participated in the Yellow River control project, and students in the Northeast and Beijing ran literacy classes to help eliminate illiteracy. More than 14,000 students in Beijing participated in voluntary labor for "World Youth Day" and "International Student Week." Many students in various places also used their holidays to go to factories and rural areas to help workers and farmers learn culture and politics and carry out recreational activities. In areas where land reform was being carried out, many students participated in land reform work. Through political studies in the early days of liberation and these social activities, as well as regular political classes in schools, the majority of students initially established a revolutionary outlook on life of serving the people, corrected their attitudes toward learning, and improved their awareness and enthusiasm for learning. After launching new democratic studies in various places, most students were able to study their regular courses seriously, listened attentively in class, and prepared well for and completed the homework assigned by teachers. Communist Party members and Youth League members set an example in the classroom and influenced their classmates with their exemplary actions. For example, the Youth League Committee of Peking University called on all students to formulate their own study plans according to the teachers' teaching plans, allocate their time appropriately, and persist in previewing and reviewing their lessons, avoiding blindness and waste in learning. The Youth League organizations of schools in Harbin, Northeast China, proposed opposing rote memorization and advocating a learning method of "knowing why" to deepen the understanding of lessons. On the other hand, schools in various places overcame the phenomenon of excessive extracurricular activities, allowing students to focus their main energy on learning, and students' academic performance also improved significantly. For example, in the first monthly exam of the first semester of Hankou Municipal First Girls' Middle School, the average score for the entire school was 67 points. After the monthly exam, the school and the Youth League branch unanimously called on students to delve deeper into regular course studies. Party members and Youth League members took the lead in organizing review sessions, discussions, and answering questions. By the end of the term, the average score for the entire school was 73 points. Seven of the top ten students in the school were Youth League members.

　　Teachers and students worked together, and teaching content and methods were initially improved.

Through the joint efforts of teachers and students, preliminary improvements have also been made in teaching content and teaching methods. In the "Steel" course of the School of Engineering at Tsinghua University, only the composition of American iron ore was discussed in the past. This semester, professors and students began to study the composition of Chinese ore and its iron smelting methods. Students in medical, agricultural, and engineering departments in Beijing, Nanjing, and other schools participated in plague prevention, prevention of crop diseases and insect pests, and various surveying projects for dike construction, road construction, and urban design. They were able to appropriately combine the knowledge and skills they had learned with practical needs.

　　Various extracurricular activities were created in various places to help with regular course studies.

In order to deepen the study and understanding of various regular courses, students in various places created a variety of extracurricular activities combined with regular course studies. Students in Harbin and other places organized various research groups under the guidance and assistance of teachers, according to their personal willingness and interests. Students of Harbin Municipal No. 4 Middle School planted some plants without hindering their regular course studies, which became living specimens, allowing them to observe the entire process of plant germination, growth, flowering, and fruiting. Students of Changchun No. 2 Middle School established a small meteorological station to conduct experiments on wind direction, wind speed, temperature, humidity, and air pressure. In addition, students in some areas used various lively and interesting recreational activities to assist in regular course studies. For example, some schools adapted the content of Chinese language and history classes into short plays and performed them at evening parties, increasing their understanding of the lessons and arousing their interest.

　　The gains from the new democratic studies over the past year are inseparable from the active efforts of the majority of teachers. Since liberation, many teachers have worked hard to study politics and professional skills, improved teaching content and methods, and enthusiastically guided students, inspiring students to have greater interest in courses and winning the love and respect of students. Some schools in some places have held "Teacher-Student Forums" and "Teaching Forums," which have played a great role in teacher-student unity and improving teaching. Peking University also held a representative meeting of teachers and students to summarize and exchange learning experiences. When Tianjin held a representative meeting of students, it also held a representative meeting of educational workers at the same time, which was very effective in jointly promoting the improvement of teaching.

　　The new democratic studies over the past year have achieved great results, but there have also been deviations, such as: neglecting classroom learning, neglecting self-study, and excessive group discussions; in terms of ideological transformation, some students simply studied technology and neglected political study, and some students neglected the study of culture and technology in ideological and political study.

### 一年来各地青年学生的新民主主义学习

　　一年来各地青年学生的新民主主义学习
    随着中国人民革命的胜利，中国学生运动进入了一个完全新的历史时期。在解放以前，中国学生运动是以反对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义在中国的反动统治，作为自己的主要任务；在解放以后，中国学生工作的任务就转为团结全体学生，努力开展新民主主义学习。
    广大学生参加了假期学习和社会服务活动
    党团员积极带头，大部学生均能认真学好正课
    各地在解放初期，学生运动都经历了轰轰烈烈的运动阶段，不但对革命起了一定的配合作用，而且帮助了广大学生的进步。在接着到来的暑假和寒假中，广大学生参加了青年团和学联所举办的学习园、青年学园、青年讲座等活动。据不完全统计，在五十多个大、中城市中有十二万的同学参加暑期学习；参加寒假学习的人数更超过此数。各地学生并根据具体情况，适当地参加了各种社会服务活动。如上海学生参加劝募公债和反轰炸的宣传工作，山东济南学生参加治黄河的工程，东北及北京的学生办识字班帮助扫除文盲。北京一万四千多学生参加“世界青年日”及“国际学生周”的义务劳动。许多地方的学生还利用假期，到工厂和农村，帮助工人农民学习文化政治，开展文娱活动，在进行土地改革的地区，不少学生参加了土地改革的工作。通过了解放初期的政治学习和这些社会活动以及学校中经常的政治课的学习，广大学生初步建立起为人民服务的革命人生观，端正学习的态度，提高了学习的自觉性和积极性。各地在展开新民主主义学习以后，大部学生都能认真学好正课，上课用心听讲，并且很好的准备和完成教师所指定的功课。共产党员、青年团员在课堂上以身作则，以自己的模范行动影响同学。如北京大学团委会号召全体同学按照教师的教学计划，订出自己的学习计划，适当地分配自己的时间，坚持预习与复习功课，避免了学习中的盲目性和浪费现象。东北哈尔滨各校青年团的组织提出反对死记条文，提倡“知道为什么”的学习方法，加深对功课的理解。另一方面各地学校克服了课外活动过多的现象，使学生把主要精力放在学习上，学生成绩也显著提高，例如汉口市立第一女中上学期第一次月考全校成绩平均为六十七分，月考后校方和团支部一致号召同学们深入正课学习，学生中的党团员带头组织温课、讨论和解答问题等，到期终考试时，全校成绩平均为七十三分。在全校前十名中有七名是团员。
    师生共同努力，教学内容与方法获得初步改进
    经过师生共同努力，在教学内容与教学方法上，也获得了初步改进。清华大学工学院“钢铁”课程，过去只讲美国铁矿的成份，这学期教授和学生开始来研究中国矿的成份及其炼铁的方法了。北京、南京等学校的医、农、工等院系的学生参加防止鼠疫，防止农作物病虫害工作，及修堤、建路、设计都市的各种测量工程等时，都能适当的把自己所学的知识技能和实际需要结合起来。
    各地创造了多种课外活动，帮助正课学习
    为了加深各种正课的学习和理解，各地学生创造了多种多样的结合正课学习的课外活动方式。哈尔滨等地的学生，根据个人的自愿与爱好，在教师的指导与协助下，组织了各种钻研小组。哈尔滨市立四中的学生，在不妨碍正课学习的条件下，种了一些植物，成为活的标本，可以观察植物萌芽、生长、开花、结果的整个过程。长春二中学生建立了一个小型气象台，作风向、风速、温度、湿度、气压等实验。另外有些地区的学生利用各种生动活泼的文娱活动方式，辅助正课学习。例如有的学校把国文课和历史课的内容编成短剧在晚会上演出，增加了对功课的了解，同时提高了兴趣。
    一年来的新民主主义学习的收获，是与广大教师们的积极努力分不开的。许多教师在解放后，努力学习政治和业务，改进教学内容和方法，并热心指导学生，以启发方式使学生对课程发生更大兴趣，获得了学生们的热爱与尊敬。有些地方的学校召开了“师生座谈会”、“教学座谈会”等，对师生团结和改进教学上起了很大的作用。北京大学还举行了师生代表会，总结和交流了学习经验。天津市在开学生代表大会时，同时举行了教育工作者代表会，在共同推动改进教学上收效很大。
    一年来的新民主主义学习，获得了很大的成绩，但也发生过偏向，如：忽视课堂学习、忽视自学、小组讨论过多等；在思想改造方面，有些学生只是单纯学习技术，忽视政治学习，另外也有些学生在进行思想政治学习中忽视文化、技术的学习。
