　　Beijing Municipal Districts' Cadres Study and Promote the Marriage Law
　　[This newspaper dispatch] The districts of Beijing Municipality have gradually started the study and promotion of the Marriage Law. Cadres in the Second, Third, Fifth, and Eighth Districts have already studied the Marriage Law or are preparing to study it. The cultural and educational sections of the Second, Third, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Eleventh Districts have already explained or are preparing to explain the Marriage Law in various adult night schools. The Propaganda Minister of the Eleventh District's CCP District Committee first gave a report to all district cadres on the Marriage Law. The district's Women's Federation also organized primary and secondary school teachers and middle school student representatives, night school staff and students, and street activists to discuss the Marriage Law, promoting it to the masses through them. When all the female cadres of the First District discussed the Marriage Law, the female comrades from the police station reflected that since the promulgation of the Marriage Law, more people have come to the police station or the district office to request solutions to marriage problems than before. They requested all comrades, especially leading comrades, to study the Marriage Law. However, some cadres in individual districts mistakenly believe that studying and promoting the Marriage Law is only a matter for female comrades and has nothing to do with male comrades, and therefore have not yet begun to study it. The general female masses strongly support the Marriage Law. Regarding the provision that divorce shall be granted if one party insists on divorce and mediation is ineffective, female workers and working women believe that this protects women and protects the legitimate freedom of divorce. However, some people still have questions or misunderstandings about the Marriage Law, such as some people who think that "the marriage age is set too high" and some who feel that "the Marriage Law is too biased towards women," so it is still necessary to carry out in-depth and extensive publicity and explanation. (Beijing Municipal Women's Federation Propaganda and Education Section)
　　[This newspaper dispatch from Tangshan] The Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the CCP Hebei Provincial Committee and the Women's Committee recently jointly issued instructions, requiring the Party committees of each county to educate cadres to correctly accept the Marriage Law, earnestly publicize it to the masses, and correct the careless style of some cadres in handling marriage cases. At the same time, it called on the organization of cadres to study the Marriage Law and related documents, especially judicial, civil affairs, and women's work cadres, to conduct in-depth research and repeated study. In addition, attention should be paid to collecting the reflections of Party members and non-Party members on the Marriage Law and the implementation of the Marriage Law, and reporting to higher authorities in a timely manner.

　　北京市各区干部学习及宣传婚姻法
    【本报讯】北京市各区已逐渐展开对婚姻法的学习和宣传。二、三、五、八等区的干部已学习婚姻法或正准备学习。二、三、五、六、七、八、十一等区的文教科，已经在各成人夜校讲解或预备讲解婚姻法。十一区中共区委宣传部长首先向全区干部作了有关婚姻法的传达报告。该区妇联会并分别组织了中小教员及中学生代表，夜校员生与街道积极分子座谈婚姻法，通过他们向群众宣传。一区全体女干部座谈婚姻法时，派出所的女同志反映：婚姻法公布以来，来派出所或区公所要求解决婚姻问题的群众比以前多了。她们要求全体同志，特别是领导同志学习婚姻法。但也有个别区的干部错误地以为学习与宣传婚姻法只是女同志的事，与男同志无关，因而还没有开始学习。一般妇女群众对婚姻法都非常拥护。对于一方坚持要求离婚，经调解无效时亦准予离婚一条，女工和劳动妇女们认为是保护妇女的，保护正当的离婚自由的。但还有些人对婚姻法有疑问或误解，如有的人认为“结婚年龄订得太高了”，有的人感到“婚姻法太偏向妇女了”，尚须深入广泛地作宣传解释。（北京市妇联宣教科）
    【本报唐山讯】中共河北省唐山地委和妇委最近联合发出指示，要求各县党委教育干部，正确地接受婚姻法，认真向群众宣传，并纠正一部分干部对婚姻案件处理不慎重的作风。同时，号召组织干部学习婚姻法及有关文件，特别是司法、民政、妇女工作干部，更要加以深入研究和反复的学习。此外要注意搜集党内、党外对婚姻法的反映以及执行婚姻法的情形，及时向上级报告。
