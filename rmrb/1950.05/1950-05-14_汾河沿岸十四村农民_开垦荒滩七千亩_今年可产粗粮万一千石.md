　　Farmers in Fourteen Villages Along the Fen River
　　Reclaim Seven Thousand Mu of Wasteland
　　This Year's Coarse Grain Production Expected to Reach Eleven Thousand Shi

    [Reported by our newspaper in Taiyuan] In order to satisfy the greatest demands of the farmers, the Zhao City County People's Government of Shanxi Province organized and led more than 1,400 farmers along the Fen River to reclaim 7,000 mu of flooded wasteland. The Shi Zhi, Hao Yi and other fourteen villages along the river in the county have experienced shrinking arable land due to years of river erosion, resulting in a situation of more people than land; in Nan Guan Ji Village, each farmer's household has only five to six fen of land, and the lives of the masses are extremely poor. In order to solve the difficulties in the lives of the farmers, the County People's Government conducted investigations and learned that individual households in Shi Zhi Village had reclaimed flooded land last year, expanding the arable land and increasing harvests, with a yield of five to eight shi of rice per mu. The leadership then seized this typical experience, deeply promoted it in various villages along the river, and mobilized reclamation. The People's Bank also lent 114 shi of millet to provide assistance. The Chinese Communist Party members, cadres and representatives of the People's Congress in various villages immediately responded enthusiastically, driving the broad masses of farmers to join this wasteland reclamation movement. Shi Zhi Village first organized a flood land reclamation committee to conduct surveys, plan projects, and prepare tools; it was decided to divide the work according to the soil's softness and hardness. After being approved by the masses, 800 mu of farmland was built in a half-month on the vast wasteland. In order to prevent river erosion, a dike five feet wide, eight feet high, and 250 zhang long was built. Under the influence and promotion of Shi Zhi Village, all the farmers in the other thirteen villages, including Hao Yi, also poured into this movement and established a unified production committee, signed a ten-year collective labor contract, and divided the reclamation according to the natural conditions of the water flow, with about 100 people per labor unit, and stipulated democratic evaluation of labor according to labor time and intensity, and grain distribution according to work points. This further stimulated everyone's enthusiasm for labor. Now, 7,000 mu of wasteland has been transformed into good land, of which 3,696 mu have been sown, and it is estimated that this year's coarse grain production can be increased by more than 11,000 shi.

    【本报太原讯】山西赵城县人民政府为满足农民最大要求，组织与领导汾河沿岸一千四百余农民开荒漫地七千亩。该县沿河石止，好义等十四村，由于历年河水冲刷，耕地面积缩小，形成人多地少；南关嵇村每户农民仅有土地五分至六分，群众生活极端贫困。该县人民政府为了解决农民生活困难，遂进行调查，了解到石止村个别户去年曾进行开荒漫滩，扩大了耕地，增加了收成，每亩收稻子五石至八石。领导方面便抓住这一典型经验，深入沿河各村宣传推广，发动垦殖。人民银行并贷出一百一十四石小米加以扶助。各村的中共党员、干部及人民代表会议代表立即热烈响应，带动了广大农民卷入这一开荒漫滩运动。石止村首先组织起漫滩委员会，进行勘察，计划工程，准备用具；议定以土质软硬，按段分工进行。经群众通过后，在广阔的荒滩上，半月内即修好八百亩田地。为了防止河水冲毁，并筑了宽五尺、高八尺、长二百五十丈的防冲堤。在石止村的影响推动下，好义等十三个村，全体农民也涌进了这一运动，并成立了统一的生产委员会，签订了十年集体劳动合同，根据水势自然条件，以每百人左右为一个劳动单位，分段进行开垦，并规定按劳动时间、强度进行民主评工，按工分粮。这样，更激发起大家的劳动积极性。现已使七千亩荒滩修成良由，其中三千六百九十六亩地已经播种完毕，预计今年可增产粗粮一万一千余石。
