Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, May 26th: A People's Liberation Army unit stationed in Henan, after initially completing the massive task of transporting public grain, has promptly transitioned into the upsurge of spring planting production. By adopting a mode of military-civilian cooperation through labor exchange and mutual assistance, the spring planting work of both the troops and the farmers has progressed well.

In March, all officers and soldiers of the unit, from division and regimental leaders to cooks, actively participated in the work of transporting state public grain. In the initial nineteen days, they transported 51.87 million catties of grain. After the grain transport task was initially completed, the unit immediately seized the opportunity to shift to a production movement focused on agriculture and supplemented by grain transportation. With the dividends earned from grain transportation, coupled with their usual savings, the officers and soldiers purchased a considerable number of water buffaloes, waterwheels, and other production tools, laying the foundation for long-term production.

With the consent and assistance of the local government, the unit found more than 43,000 mu of wasteland and more than 1,700 mu of vegetable land. When demarcating the boundary between the unit's wasteland and the farmers' cultivated land, each unit consulted with the farmers in advance and obtained their consent before proceeding with reclamation. In cases where units mistakenly reclaimed the farmers' wasteland, they immediately returned it.

With the assistance of the local government, the unit implemented large-scale labor and animal exchange with local farmers. Based on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, contracts were signed with the farmers, exchanging three units of military labor for one unit of buffalo power for labor exchange and mutual assistance. The troops helped the farmers transplant rice seedlings and harvest wheat, while the farmers supplied the troops with buffalo power during their spare time for wasteland reclamation and cultivation. Because each unit fully explained the benefits of military-civilian cooperation and labor exchange and mutual assistance to the farmers in the garrison, many farmers actively sought the unit to discuss and sign various labor exchange contracts. According to incomplete statistics from a certain regiment, more than 170 buffaloes and plows from more than 90 villages of farmers had joined the labor exchange organization.

In order to rationally use manpower and animal power, the unit also implemented a group rotation system, concentrating all the labor exchange groups and rotating labor in order.

The implementation of the above labor exchange methods has enabled the wasteland reclamation work to proceed smoothly. The mortar company of a certain regiment used human and animal labor exchange to organize twelve plows, and reclaimed more than 60 mu of wasteland on the first day. A certain regiment, through cooperation with farmers, completed the harrowing of 3,347 mu of land. On the farmers' side, with the assistance of the army, they were able to sow in time without missing the farming season.

Currently, a division of the unit has reclaimed more than 20,000 mu of wasteland. Another unit reclaimed 6,740 mu of wasteland in fifteen days. The entire wasteland reclamation plan can be successfully completed. Many companies also frequently hold symposiums to solicit the opinions of farmers in order to strengthen military-civilian relations and exchange production experience. Because of learning from the farmers with an open mind and conducting collective research, the officers and soldiers quickly became familiar with the cultivation methods in the Central Plains. At present, the unit is carrying out a comprehensive crop planting work, while also digging ditches, scooping out silt, accumulating water, and preventing drought to ensure a bountiful autumn harvest.

　　驻河南解放军某部
    与农民变工互助进行春耕
    根据自愿两利订立合约获得农民拥护
    【新华社开封二十六日电】驻河南的人民解放军某部，在初步完成了巨额的公粮运输任务以后，随即转入春耕生产的热潮中。由于采取了军民合作、变工互助的方式，部队和农民的春耕工作都已经很好地展开。
    三月间，该部全体指战员，从师、团首长到炊事员都积极地参加了运输国家公粮的工作。在最初的十九天中，就运粮五千一百八十七万斤。当运粮任务初步完成以后，该部立即抓紧时机，转入以农业为主、运粮为辅的生产运动。指战员们以运粮所得的红利，加上平日的积蓄，购买了不少的水牛和水车等生产工具，打下长期生产的基础。
    该部经地方政府的同意和协助，觅得荒地四万三千余亩，菜地一千七百余亩。在划分部队的荒地与农民熟地的接壤区时，各单位都于事前与农民商量并征得他们的同意后，才进行开垦。有的单位错开了农民的荒地，都立即退还。
    该部在地方政府的协助下，与当地农民实行人畜大变工，根据自愿两利的原则，与农民订立合约，以部队的三个劳动力换一个牛力，实行变工互助。部队帮助农民插秧、割麦，农民则以闲时的牛力供给部队垦荒种地。由于各单位在驻地农民中间充分地说明了军民合作、变工互助的好处，很多农民纷纷找部队商量订立各种变工合同。根据某团不完全的统计，已有农民的一百七十余头水牛和九十多村农耙参加了变工组织。
    为了合理地使用人力、畜力，该部并实行分组轮流耕作制度，把所有的变工小组集中起来，按照次序，轮流劳动。
    上述变工办法的实施，使开荒工作得以顺利进行。某团迫击炮连利用人畜变工，组织犁杖十二付，第一天便开荒六十余亩。某团因与农民合作，完成耙地三千三百四十七亩。在农民方面，也因军队的协助，得以及时播种，不误农时。
    现该部的一个师已开荒两万余亩。某部则在十五天内开荒六千七百四十亩。全部开荒计划即可顺利完成。很多连队并经常举行座谈会，征求农民的意见，以密切军民关系和交流生产经验。由于虚心地向农民学习并进行了集体研究，指战员们很快地熟悉了中原地带的耕种方法。目前该部正展开全面的种植作物工作，同时进行挖沟掏污，积水防旱，以保证有丰盛的秋收。
