　　Cangxi Village's Victory Over Disaster
    ——The CCP Cangxi Village Branch Leads the Masses in Production to Overcome Famine
    Cangxi Village, Zhucun District, Nanling County, is an administrative village composed of ten small natural villages. The village has 317 households with 1,390 people and 4,238 mu of cultivated land. Last autumn, excessive rainfall caused a disaster. River dikes broke, and most of the cultivated land was flooded. 295 households were affected, accounting for more than 93% of the village's total households. Those less severely affected had some harvest, while those severely affected had no harvest at all. Therefore, leading the masses in production for self-relief and to overcome the winter and spring famine became a serious problem. Although some grain was recovered during the struggle to settle accounts with the evil landlord despots Ye Rongchun and Wu Benqi, who relied on the enemy and puppet forces to exploit and oppress the peasants in the past, and was distributed to the poor peasants who had no means of subsistence, initially solving the livelihood problems of some disaster-stricken people; however, due to the severity of the disaster and the inability to drain most of the flooded fields, it was impossible to plant early-maturing crops to shorten the famine period. As a result, the disaster gradually worsened, and the people's lives became more difficult day by day. The CCP village branch and its members in the village then led the masses to carry out production for self-relief. Under the leadership and assistance of the county people's government and the CCP county and district committees, they launched a struggle against the famine and achieved great results.
    Cangxi Village has a total of twelve CCP members. The branch secretary, Zhang Jifang (who also serves as a public security officer in the village), and the branch propaganda committee member, Dai Bingzhang (the village head), seeing the severity of the famine, convened all the party members to discuss specific measures to lead the masses in production for self-relief and to overcome the famine. It was decided to first organize the masses to reclaim wasteland, cultivate the unflooded slopes, field ridges, and idle land, and plant early-maturing crops to shorten the famine period. After the meeting, all party members went deep into the natural villages to specifically mobilize and promote the work. Fourteen wasteland reclamation teams were organized, including 154 households, with more than 400 men, women, and children. All party members participated in the various teams to specifically lead and take the lead in promoting the work. By April 10th, 112 mu of wasteland had been reclaimed; 28 mu had been planted with potatoes, 60 mu with corn, and 8 mu with rapeseed. Rapeseed can be eaten in thirty days, and both corn and potatoes are early-maturing crops. With these new lands and early-maturing crops, it has a great effect on shortening the famine, stabilizing the people's productive mood, and increasing confidence in overcoming the famine.
    In order to prevent floods and solve the livelihood problems of disaster victims, the people's government decided to repair the breached dikes by means of work-for-relief. The Cangxi Village CCP branch immediately called on party members and the masses to participate in this repair project. It educated party members that they must share weal and woe with the masses, and influence and lead the masses with exemplary actions. At the beginning, about 170 people participated in the repair work, gradually increasing to more than 300. Initially, each person carried an average of 1.5 to 2 cubic meters of soil per day, gradually increasing to more than 3 cubic meters. The grain earned by each person for repairing the dike each day, in addition to maintaining their own life, could also support one to two people. The enthusiasm of the masses was very high. They started early and worked late, and did more work every day than other villages.
    The disaster-stricken people used the grain they received and earned from repairing the dikes to solve their livelihood problems and survive the severe winter. However, "famine fears the tail, not the head." In the spring, when the old crop was gone and the new crop was not yet ripe, the 21 households of martyrs' families, military dependents, and orphans and disabled people, who lacked labor, were running out of food because no one participated in the dike repair work, and their lives became more difficult. District cadres working in the village, after discussing with the village branch, proposed launching a mutual aid movement to solve the livelihood problems of these 21 households. The branch mobilized party members to go to various natural villages to carry out propaganda and mobilization, and held meetings with households with surplus grain, calling on them to help each other and donate grain to relieve disaster victims, so that everyone in the village could overcome the famine. In a day or two, 17 dan of rice were received from the voluntary donations of the masses, and the difficulties of the 21 households that had run out of food were solved. In March, many households became panicked about their livelihood again. The branch and party members immediately called on the masses to launch another mutual aid movement. Party member Wang Yulin, a middle peasant tenant, had a family of seven, cultivated 25 mu of tenant land, and did not have much surplus grain. He was the first to voluntarily donate 140 jin of grain; the masses, considering his family's livelihood, only asked him to donate 90 jin. Wang Yulin's exemplary action led 30 households to donate voluntarily, ranging from 10 jin, 8 jin, 20 jin, to 30 jin, totaling 623 jin of grain, solving the livelihood difficulties of 38 households with 86 people.
    Now, the famine period is about to pass, and the Cangxi Village CCP branch is leading the masses to fight the last and most serious stage of the famine, and has launched various production activities. For the few elderly, weak, sick, and disabled households with the greatest difficulties who lack labor, plans are being made to solve their long-term livelihood problems, not only ensuring that they overcome the famine, but also providing appropriate solutions to their production and livelihood difficulties after the famine.

### 战胜灾荒的仓溪村——中共仓溪村支部领导群众生产渡荒

　　战胜灾荒的仓溪村
    ——中共仓溪村支部领导群众生产渡荒
    南陵县朱村区仓溪村，是一个由十个小自然村组成的行政村。全村三百一十七户人家，一千三百九十人，耕地四千二百三十八亩。去年秋天，雨水成灾，河堤决口，大部分耕地被水淹没，受灾者达二百九十五户，占全村总户数的百分之九十三强。灾情轻的稍有收获，重的则毫无收成。因此，领导群众生产自救，渡过冬春两季的灾荒，成了严重的问题。虽然在对过去依仗敌伪势力、剥削压迫农民的恶霸地主叶荣春、吴本启等的清算斗争中，收回一些粮食，分给了生活无着的贫苦农民，初步解决了一些受灾群众的生活问题；但因灾情过重，被淹没的田地，大部不能排水，想种些早熟作物以缩短灾荒也不可能，所以灾情逐渐严重，群众生活也就一天比一天困难起来。该村中共村支部及党员们，乃领导群众展开生产自救，在县人民政府和中共县委、区委的领导与帮助下，与灾荒展开了斗争，获得很大成绩。
    仓溪村共有中共党员十二人。支部书记张继芳（在村中任公安员）、支部宣传委员戴炳章（村长）二人，看到灾荒的严重情况，召集全体党员，商讨领导群众生产自救、渡过灾荒的具体办法。决定首先组织群众开荒，把未被水淹的土坡、坡埂及闲地等开垦出来，种植早熟作物，以缩短灾荒。会后，全体党员即深入各自然村，具体动员推动，共组织了十四个开荒小组，包括一百五十四户，男女老幼四百余人。全体党员都参加到各个组内，具体领导并带头推动。至四月十日已开出荒地一百一十二亩；已种上洋芋头二十八亩，玉蜀黍六十亩，油菜八亩。油菜三十天就可以吃，玉蜀黍和洋芋头也都是早熟作物。有了这些新地及早熟作物，对缩短灾荒与安定群众生产情绪和提高渡荒信心，是有很大的作用的。
    人民政府为防止水灾并解决灾民的生活问题，决定以以工代赈的办法，修复被冲决的堤坝。仓溪村中共支部即号召党员、群众参加此一修复工程。教育党员必须与群众在一起同甘共苦，以模范行动，影响带动群众。开始时参加修复工作的群众约一百七十人，逐渐增加到三百余人。起初每天每人平均挑一方半到二方土，逐渐增至三方多。每人每天修堤所得的粮食，除维持本人生活外，尚能养活一人至二人，群众情绪十分高涨，起早搭黑，每天都比别村干的活多。
    受灾的群众，借分得的和复堤所得的粮食，解决了生活问题，渡过了严寒的冬季。可是“灾荒怕尾不怕头”，春季青黄不接，缺乏劳动力的烈、军属及孤寡残废的二十一户，因没有人参加复堤工作，坐吃山空，生活更加困难。在村工作的区干部，与村支部商讨后，提出开展互助互济运动，解决该二十一户的生活问题。支部动员党员分头到各自然村进行宣传动员，召开有余粮户会议，号召互助互济，捐献粮食，救济灾民，使全村每一个人都渡过灾荒。一二日间，收到群众自动捐粮十七石稻子，二十一家断炊户的困难，得以解决。三月份，许多户的生活又发生了恐慌，支部、党员即号召群众再次展开互助运动。党员王玉林，是个佃中农，家有七口人，种佃田二十五亩，余粮并不多，首先自愿拿出一百四十斤粮食；群众因顾及他家的生活，只叫他拿出九十斤。王玉林的这一模范行动，带动了三十户自动捐献，十斤、八斤、二十斤、三十斤不等，共献粮六百二十三斤，解决了三十八户、八十六人的生活困难。
    现在，灾荒时期即可过去，仓溪村中共支部正领导群众，和最后也是最严重的一段灾荒进行斗争，并已展开各项生产工作。对少数缺乏劳力、困难最大的几家孤老残疾户，正计划解决其长远的生活问题，不仅保证其渡过灾荒，就是灾荒过后的生产、生活困难，都将给以适当解决。
