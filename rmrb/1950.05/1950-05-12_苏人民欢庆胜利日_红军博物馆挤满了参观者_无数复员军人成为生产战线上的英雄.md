Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th Dispatch from TASS: The Soviet people are enthusiastically celebrating Victory Day over Germany. In Moscow, people met heroes of the Great Patriotic War in parks, and the Central Red Army Museum was packed with visitors. The soldiers' cemeteries everywhere were piled high with bright bouquets.

Tens of thousands of demobilized soldiers have achieved new victories in their production posts. At the Leningrad Labor Banner Factory, demobilized Sergeant and lathe operator Lebedev manufactured stainless steel parts at a rate eleven times faster than usual. Infantryman Panov and sailor Ivanov, who defended Leningrad and Sevastopol, both exceeded their quotas by three times. Sergeant Salhan, an artilleryman who won six medals, is now a foreman at the Baku oil fields. His work team, composed of soldiers, has already over-produced hundreds of tons of oil this year. In Stalingrad, Vilnius, Almaty, Kiev, and Minsk, countless heroes of the war have achieved brilliant labor accomplishments.
