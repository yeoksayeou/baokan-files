Xinhua News Agency, London, May 29th (TASS dispatch): The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party has issued a May Day manifesto, calling on all workers in Britain to unite with working people of all other countries in the struggle for peace.

    The manifesto points out: War plans, and the attacks on workers that accompany them, can be defeated by the actions of the people. The British working class must first of all make this May Day the beginning of a new advance in the struggle for peace.

    In order to defend peace, raise wages, build more housing and improve social services, in order to restore our national independence and defeat the Conservative Party, workers must unite and fight together against war policies and for a genuine working-class policy—a policy of peace and improved living standards.

    British workers can draw inspiration from the examples of workers in the Soviet Union, the People's Democratic countries, and the People's Republic of China in their struggles.

    The great struggles waged by the working class and their allies in France, Italy, and other European countries are also examples for us. They are not only calling for peace, but also defending peace with practical actions. Their actions have frustrated the plans of the American ruling class to use them as cannon fodder.

    British workers! Fight for peace!

    Turn the great petition movement of the British Peace Committee into a powerful expression of the people's desire for peace!

    Demand the prohibition of the atomic bomb and the reduction of armaments!

　　英共发布五一宣言
    号召联合一切国家劳动人民用战斗的行动击败战争计划
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社伦敦二十九日讯：英国共产党执行委员会发布五一宣言，号召英国全体工人联合一切别的国家的劳动人民，进行争取和平的斗争。
    宣言指出：战争计划以及随之而来的对工人的攻击，是可以用人民的行动来击败的。英国工人阶级首先必须使这次五一节成为争取和平斗争的新进展的开端。
    为了要保卫和平、提高工资、建造更多的住宅和改进社会服务，为了要恢复我们的民族独立和击溃保守党，工人们必需团结起来，为反对战争政策、争取真正的工人阶级的政策——和平及提高生活水准的政策而共同斗争。
    英国工人在斗争中，可以自苏联、人民民主国家和中华人民共和国工人的范例获得鼓舞。
    法国、意大利及其他欧洲国家工人阶级及其同盟者所进行的伟大斗争，也是我们的范例。他们并不仅只是号召和平，而且更以实际的行动来保卫和平。他们的行动挫败了美国统治阶级企图利用他们作炮灰的计划。
    英国工人们！为和平而斗争！
    把英国和平委员会的伟大的请愿运动变为人民渴望和平的强有力的表示！
    要求禁止原子弹和裁减军备！
