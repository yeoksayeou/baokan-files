Tianjin Citizen Xiong Shutao
　　Donates Ancient Artifact "? Yuan Bell"
　　[This newspaper's dispatch] Tianjin citizen Xiong Shutao recently donated the ancient bronze "? Yuan Bell", which had been in his family's collection for sixty years, to the nation. Mayor Huang Jing of Tianjin Municipality presided over the acceptance ceremony. On the 12th of this month, personnel dispatched by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, along with the donor, transported the artifact to Beijing, where it is temporarily stored at the Cultural Relics Bureau. Guo Moruo, Vice Premier of the Government Administration Council, Minister of Culture Shen Yanbing, Vice Ministers Zhou Yang and Ding Xielin, and Director of the Palace Museum Ma Heng, among others, personally went to appraise the bell on the 13th, determining it to be an artifact of the Yue State from the Spring and Autumn period. According to donor Xiong Shutao, this artifact has been preserved in his family since its excavation. During the late Qing Dynasty and the Republican period, wealthy and powerful individuals offered high prices to forcibly purchase it, but Mr. Xiong consistently declined. After liberation, he believed that donating the ancient artifact to the people was the most glorious and appropriate course of action, and after several contacts, his wish was finally fulfilled.

　　天津市民熊述匋
　  捐献古器“?原钟”
    【本报讯】天津市民熊述匋，近将家藏六十年的古铜器“?原钟”献给国家，已由天津市政府黄敬市长主持接受典礼，并于本月十二日由中央人民政府文化部派员偕同捐献者将该器运送到京，暂存文物局。政务院郭沫若副总理、文化部沈雁冰部长、副部长周扬、丁燮林、故宫博物院院长马衡等均于十三日亲往鉴定，断为春秋时越国器。据捐献人熊述匋谈，此器自从出土就一直保存在他家，在前清及民国时期，曾为有钱有势的人出重价强买，熊氏始终推脱拒绝。解放后他认为把古器献给人民是最光荣妥善的，经几次接洽，终如愿以偿。
