　　To rectify the bureaucratic work style in trade work, the Ministry of Trade decided to strengthen inspections. The Shijiazhuang Department Store and Zhengzhou Salt Company will be subject to certain punishments for violating cash management orders.
    [Reported by this newspaper] In order to inspect the situation of state-owned trade work in various places since the unification of trade work, the Central Ministry of Trade organized inspection teams to go to various places for inspection. In early April, inspection teams were sent to six cities, namely Shijiazhuang, Xinxiang, Zhengzhou, Xuzhou, Jinan, and Tianjin, to conduct inspections with a focus. After a month, in addition to discovering several problems between state-owned trade departments and cooperatives, and between local trade administrative departments and state-owned trade departments, which need to be resolved, serious bureaucratic work styles were also found to exist. In Xinxiang and Zhengzhou, the doors open at 9:00 AM and close at 5:00 PM. The Zhengzhou Department Store and Cotton Yarn and Cloth Companies still close their doors for lunch at 12:00 noon. In the Shijiazhuang Department Store, wholesaling goods requires four procedures, plus two procedures for paying taxes at the tax bureau, making it six procedures in total. In the Zhengzhou Department Store, buying a toothbrush in the retail department also requires four procedures. In the wholesale department of the Jinan Department Store, taking goods from the small warehouse requires ten procedures, and taking goods from the large warehouse requires twelve procedures. Customers need at least five hours to buy goods once. If the payment cannot be made to the bank, the time will be even longer. The wholesale department of the Jinan Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company does not stock goods. After customers complete the procedures, they have to go to the warehouse to pick up the goods, and it takes an hour by car from the warehouse to the retail department. The Jinan Coal Company does not sell coal less than 100 jin. Those who buy more than 100 jin have to go through six procedures. If the goods are bought in the afternoon, they cannot be picked up on the same day, forming a phenomenon that goods are not sold in the afternoon. The Zhengzhou Grain and Department Stores and the Xuzhou Department Store ask customers to sort out banknotes, otherwise they will not accept them. In addition, most of the cadres in the retail departments of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth and Department Stores are students who have just graduated from school. They speak bluntly and are impatient. Some people think that doing less is better than doing more. The Zhengzhou Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company also stipulated customer rules when receiving cotton. These phenomena of being divorced from the masses have greatly affected the development of business.

    In addition, in inspecting the work of sales and recovery of funds, the inspection team found the phenomenon of misappropriating sales funds. For example, the Shijiazhuang Department Store actually received 2.5 billion yuan in sales revenue in March, but only remitted 2.3 billion yuan to the treasury, with more than 190 million yuan being privately misappropriated. The Zhengzhou Salt Company actually received more than 5 billion yuan in sales revenue in March, but only remitted more than 1.2 billion yuan to the treasury, with the remaining more than 3 billion yuan being used to pay for transportation costs and routine expenses. This phenomenon of not complying with cash management orders must be thoroughly inspected and should be punished.

    In order to thoroughly correct these phenomena, the Central Ministry of Trade convened a meeting in early May with the managers of various professional companies, as well as the directors of the commercial departments, cooperative directors, and grain company managers of Hebei, Pingyuan, Chahar, Henan, Shandong, and Northern Anhui provinces, and the directors of the commercial bureaus of Beijing and Tianjin to discuss and study. It was decided that inspections should be further strengthened in the future. In addition to the professional companies of the Ministry of Trade sending people to various places to inspect, it is even more necessary to rely on the local government trade departments to carry out inspections. At the same time, ideological mobilization should be carried out to oppose bureaucracy. Various work reward and punishment systems should be established to give play to the creativity and enthusiasm of the staff. The Ministry of Trade has successively issued orders to various places to earnestly implement the above points.

　　纠正贸易工作中的官僚主义作风
    贸易部决加强检查 
    石家庄百货公司和郑州盐业公司违反现金管理命令须受一定处分
    【本报讯】中央贸易部为检查贸易工作统一以来，各地国营贸易工作情况，曾组织了检查组赴各地进行检查。检查组于四月初分别派往石家庄、新乡、郑州、徐州、济南、天津六个城市，有重点地进行检查，历经一月，除发现了国营贸易部门与合作社之间、地方贸易行政部门对国营贸易部门之间存在着若干问题待解决外，并发现存在着严重的官僚主义作风。新乡、郑州实行九点开门，五点关门。郑州百货、花纱布两公司门市正午十二点钟还关上门吃饭。石家庄百货公司批发货物须经四道手续，连同税局交税是六道手续。郑州百货公司门市部买一把牙刷也须经过四道手续。济南百货公司批发部小库取货须经十道手续，大库取货十二道手续，用户买一次货至少须五个钟头。如到银行交不上款，时间还得拉长。济南花纱布公司批发门市部不存货，顾客办完手续，须到仓库取货，仓库离门市部单坐车就需一个钟头。济南煤业公司售煤百斤以下不卖，百斤以上者要经过六道手续，下午买了货当天取不走，形成下午不卖货的现象。郑州粮食、百货公司及徐州百货公司让顾客整理钞票，否则不收。又花纱布、百货两公司门市部干部大部分是学校刚毕业的学生，说话生硬，不耐心，部分人员认为多一事不如少一事。郑州花纱布公司在收棉时还规定了顾客守则。这些脱离群众的现象，大大影响了业务的开展。
    此外，在检查推销回笼工作中，检查组发现有动用销货款的现象。如石家庄百货公司三月份实收入销货款二十五亿元，解库仅二十三亿余元，私自动用的即有一亿九千余万。郑州盐业公司三月份实收入销货款五十余亿元，解库的仅十二亿余元，其余三十多亿元都支付了运费与经常费。这种不遵守现金管理命令的现象，必须深入检查，并应受到处分。
    中央贸易部为了彻底纠正这些现象，特于五月上旬召集了各专业公司经理及河北、平原、察哈尔、河南、山东、皖北等省商业厅长、合作社主任、粮食公司经理及京、津两市商业局长开会讨论研究，决定今后要进一步加强检查工作，除贸易部各专业公司派人到各地检查外，更要依靠地方政府贸易部门来进行。同时更应进行思想动员，反对官僚主义。建立各种工作奖惩制度，发挥工作人员的创造性与积极性。以上各点贸易部已先后通令各地切实执行。
