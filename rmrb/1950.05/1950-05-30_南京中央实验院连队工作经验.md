Work Experience of the Company Unit of the Central Experimental Institute in Nanjing
    Wang Chengfa

　　After the Huaihai Campaign, the organs of the former Nanjing puppet government fled south, and most of the colleagues of the Experimental Institute remained in Nanjing to stick to their posts. In order to protect the people's property, they automatically organized a response committee, so that the institute's property was not lost, and most of the research work could still be carried out. Within the first three months after the Health Department of the Second Field Army took over the Experimental Institute, the staff who remained in the institute assisted in the inventory work. The work of individual departments, such as the experimental area, was suspended due to the evacuation of staff and has not yet been fully restored. The inventory work ended in July last year, and the political study and research work of the staff in the institute gradually began. In October, a certain unit of the East China People's Liberation Army suffered from malaria and nutritional deficiencies, which affected the rectification mission. Therefore, the Health Department of the Third Field Army called on Nanjing health medical personnel to serve the soldiers. The Experimental Institute responded to this call and formed a health work team to go deep into the troops. Units such as the Institute of Epidemiology and Prevention, the Institute of Nutrition, the Health Teaching Group, and the Health Engineering Group participated in the work. Before departure, we examined our past work attitude and studied the steps for carrying out the work. We believe that this work is a good opportunity for health science workers to learn from revolutionary soldiers and conduct political training, and it is also the beginning of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. With this spirit, we concentrated all our efforts and worked in the company for six or seven months in three phases.

    How is the health work in the army carried out?

    If we want to truly serve the soldiers and solve their health problems, first, we should discover the problems in their actual lives. We adopted the methods of investigation and research. Second, we made the commanders and fighters deeply understand the principle that prevention is more important than cure, and provided improvement suggestions based on the actual survey materials in the local troops after research. At the same time, the content of health education was made into charts, exhibitions, lectures, movies, dramas, etc. suitable for the local soldiers to accept, and universal publicity was carried out. Third, in order to ensure that the health work of the troops can be sustained and the health of the soldiers is guaranteed, short-term health training courses were held in the military headquarters or division headquarters to train health workers in their original positions, and local troops were dispatched to cooperate with health cadres. Our work units also learned while working, so that health technology improved. The health work in the troops was carried out under this principle.

    What work was done?

    Our work items were determined according to the health problems existing in the company.

    (1) Malaria problem: In a certain army, one-fourth of the soldiers suffered from malaria in October last year, of which tertian malaria accounted for 65.5%, malignant malaria accounted for 21.8%, and quartan malaria accounted for 12.7%. They originally used "Malaricide" for treatment, and most of the methods of administration could not meet the standards. After providing suggestions, they were all corrected. Under the leadership of the Party Committee, a certain army vigorously carried out mosquito prevention work, giving play to the creativity of the masses. All soldiers could live in mosquito nets created by themselves; soldiers on sentry duty at night also applied mosquito oil on time, which greatly reduced the prevalence of malaria. Another unit did not pay attention to prevention work early, and only used medicine for treatment. The total cost of treating malaria was more than that of issuing a mosquito net to each soldier in the whole army. At the same time, the prevalence of malaria did not stop due to the use of medicine.

    This lesson made everyone more clearly realize the principle that prevention is more important than cure.

    (2) Japanese schistosomiasis problem: In October last year, a certain unit examined 531 fecal samples and found only 1% of schistosomiasis eggs and 4% of early symptoms such as rubella and edema. Although the number was very small, collective swimming indicated that it might spread in the future. For the needs of future prevention work, we have taught the inspection of snail snails, stool smear examination, and treatment methods based on local materials. By December, the disease broke out in a certain army, with about 14,000 patients. Such a large-scale prevention and control work is unprecedented in the history of medicine. We participated in this work, not only serving the commanders and fighters, but also gained many valuable experiences, which can be used as a reference for future prevention, control, and research work. For example, whether wearing a layer of cloth pants to cross the water can prevent the invasion of tail larvae into the skin, after research, it is known that a layer of cloth will be penetrated by the tail larvae in five minutes after being wet; two layers can prevent it. Other issues such as improving treatment methods and reflecting on treatment are all issues that need to be studied in the future.

    (3) Nutrition problem: Before we went to the troops, everyone felt that every soldier of the People's Liberation Army was healthy and there would be no nutritional problems. Some people think that nutritional problems cannot be easily discussed. If malnutrition problems are found in the troops, the current economic situation cannot solve them, so they are afraid to talk about this problem. After investigation and research, we clearly pointed out that 6.6% of soldiers in a certain army suffered from night blindness, 48% from stomatitis, 5.6% from scrotal dermatitis, and 81.2% from gingivitis. In December, another unit of soldiers suffered from night blindness up to 15.3%, stomatitis 52.2%, and scrotal dermatitis 32.2%. These facts aroused the attention of military and political leaders. After we proposed remedial measures based on the shortcomings found and considering the possibility of the supply system, the psychology of being afraid to talk about nutrition was also eliminated.

    There are more diseases caused by nutritional deficiencies, which led us to re-study the cooking methods and vitamin loss rate. It was found that after the procedure of boiling and squeezing out the soup from vegetables, the loss of vitamin C and riboflavin reached more than 95%, which is a more powerful confirmation of the high incidence of vitamin deficiency diseases. The high incidence of scrotal inflammation and stomatitis led to our clinical treatment experiments, which proved that scrotal inflammation and other diseases are indeed caused by riboflavin deficiency. In this practical work, it was also found that northerners who came to Jiangnan for the first time suffered from scrotal inflammation more than people who had lived in the south for a long time. What is the reason? This is a new problem for future research.

    (4) Environmental sanitation problem: A certain army already has a considerable foundation in environmental sanitation. After investigating 30 companies, we know that there are still many areas that need to be improved technically. For example, the selection of water well and toilet addresses; the thin layer of filtering gravel is not up to standard, and the filtered water is more turbid than before filtering; the mouth of the spittoon is too small, and it is quite painful to aim at spitting; there are also some unnoticed sanitary constructions such as kitchen sewage, oil removal ponds, garbage cans, etc., but after publicity and explanation and the introduction of practical sanitary construction methods, their creativity was inspired, and thus more applicable local flushing toilets were created. At present, the environmental sanitation equipment of the army has been generally improved.

    (5) Health education:

    (1) The knowledge of prevention of diseases in Jiangnan has been generally improved among commanders and fighters: In the three phases of work, we have contacted more than 80,000 soldiers and cadres. In addition to using some movies for publicity and education, we also designed more than ten kinds of slides and more than ten kinds of exhibition materials for the soldiers, in line with the actual situation of the troops. According to the results of the test, the average score of soldiers' health common sense was 75 points before education and 82 points after education.

    Through these materials, the soldiers realized that diseases can be prevented and have confidence in prevention work. In the past, some people did not understand "why" hygiene? Some people did some hygiene work in order to obey the orders of their superiors. After the publicity and education, the soldiers were able to consciously and voluntarily promote the hygiene system and improve environmental sanitation, which brought new development to the hygiene work of the company.

    (2) Understanding the health situation of the troops and providing suggestions for improvement: In the past, the troops were busy with combat rescue and did not conduct systematic health education. The methods were rigid and did not maximize the effect. Some only had two health classes in four months, and some went into the details when explaining the human body structure, ignoring important physiological knowledge. We provided some suggestions for improvement (for example, holding classes once a week, focusing on the transmission and prevention of diseases in Jiangnan), assisting military and political cadres to personally give health classes to soldiers, strengthening health education for cadres, and making full use of cadres with artistic talent to draw health education posters. The methods for preventing various important diseases in Jiangnan were summarized into "Ten Regular Hygiene Systems", calling on the entire army to implement them consistently, which will have a considerable effect on future disease prevention work.

    (3) Assisting the troops in carrying out social sanitation: After working and studying, the soldiers jointly assisted the local people in improving the environment that endangers health. For example, the fourth company of a certain regiment has jointly organized a local disease prevention committee with the local people. The soldiers dug wells for the people and stipulated that it is not allowed to wash commodes in the river. The soldiers also assisted the local people in moving the dung tanks of the whole village outside the village. Doing this in various places will not only guarantee the health of the troops, but also help improve the local health work.

　　南京中央实验院连队工作经验
    王成发
    自淮海战役后，原南京伪政府机关纷纷南逃，实验院同仁大半留宁坚守岗位。为了保护人民财产，自动组织了应变委员会，使院产未受到损失，大部分研究工作仍能进行。第二野战军卫生部接管实验院后的头三个月内，留院人员协助进行了清点工作。个别部门工作如实验区，因工作人员疏散而告停止，迄今尚未全部恢复。去年七月间清点工作结束，院内人员的政治学习与研究工作逐渐展开。十月间，华东人民解放军某部因发生疟疾和营养缺乏病，影响了整训任务。于是第三野战军卫生部号召南京卫生医务人员为战士服务。实验院响应了这个号召，组成了卫生工作队深入部队工作。参加工作的有流行病预防实验所、营养实验所、卫生教导组、卫生工程组等单位。在出发之前，我们检查了自己过去的工作态度，研究了进行工作的步骤。我们认为这一次工作是卫生科学工作者向革命战士学习和进行政治锻炼的好机会，也是服务工农兵的开始。我们本着这样的精神，集中了全部力量，前后三次，在连队里工作了六七个月。
    部队中的卫生工作是怎样展开的？
    我们要真正为战士们服务，解决他们的卫生问题，第一、应当从他们的实际生活中发现问题之所在，我们采用了调查和研究的方法。第二、我们使指战员深刻了解预防重于治疗的道理，就根据当地部队中实际调查的材料，经过研究后提供改进意见。同时把卫生教育的内容，制成适合于当地战士接受程度的图表展览、演讲、电影、话剧等进行普遍宣传。第三、我们为了使部队的卫生工作能够坚持下去，保证战士的健康，在军部或师部举办了短期卫生讲习班，训练原岗位上的卫生工作者，并且由当地部队派遣卫生干部配合。我们的各工作单位也边作边学，使卫生技术提高了一步。部队中卫生工作，就在这个原则下展开了。
    做了些什么工作？
    我们的工作项目都是随着连队在卫生上存在的问题决定的。
    （一）疟疾问题：某军在去年十月中患疟疾者占四分之一，其中间日疟占百分之六十五点五，恶性疟百分之二十一点八，三日疟百分之十二点七。他们原来都是以“疟涤平”治疗，投给的方法多不能合于标准。经提供意见后，都得到了矫正。某军在党委领导下，大力进行了防蚊工作，发挥群众的创造力，全部战士都能住自己创作的蚊帐；战士在夜间站岗，也都按时涂敷蚊油等，使疟疾流行大减。而另一部队未及早注意预防工作，只用药治，其治疟所用之总经费较为全军每一战士发一蚊帐所用者尤多，同时疟疾流行并未因用药而停止。
    从这一次的教训，使大家更清楚的认识了预防重于治疗的道理。
    （二）日本血吸虫病问题：去年十月间，某部检查粪样五三一起，仅发现有血吸虫卵者百分之一，有早期症状如风疹、浮肿等者百分之四。为数虽然甚微，但因集体游泳，预示今后有传播开来的可能。为将来进行预防工作的需要，我们已就当地的材料，教以钉螺蛳的检验、大便涂片检查及治疗方法等。迨十二月间，该病在某军大发，患者约有一万四千人。这样大规模的防治工作，在医学史是空前的。我们参加了这次工作，不仅服务了指战员，也得了许多宝贵的经验，足为今后防治与研究工作的参考。例如穿一层布料裤子渡水，是否可以防止尾幼的侵入皮肤的问题，经过研究后，知道一层布料湿透后，尾幼于五分钟可以侵入；二层即可以防止。其他如改良治疗方法、反映处理等，都是将来需要研究的问题。
    （三）营养问题：在我们没下部队以前，大家都觉得解放军的每个战士都是健康的，不会有什么营养问题。有的人认为营养问题是不能轻易谈的，若在部队中发现营养不良问题存在，目前经济现况是不能解决的，所以怕谈这个问题。经过调查研究之后，我们清楚的指出：某军患夜盲者占百分之六点六，口腔炎者百分之四十八，阴囊皮炎者百分之五点六，齿龈炎百分之八十一点二。十二月间，另一个部队战士患夜盲者达百分之十五点三，口腔炎百分之五二点二，阴囊皮炎者百分之卅二点二。这些事实，引起了军政首长的重视。我们根据发现的缺点，照顾供给制度的可能性，提出补救办法之后，怕谈营养的心理亦因之消除了。
    由于营养缺乏而得的病较多，引起我们对烹饪方法与维生素损失率之重新研究。发现了菜蔬经煮、挤出汤的手续，丙种维生素和核黄素损失达百分之九十五强，这个更为维生素缺乏病多的强有力的证实。由于阴囊炎与口腔炎之多，引起我们临床治疗的实验，证明阴囊炎等的确是核黄素的缺乏所致。这次实际工作中，更发现了北方人初到江南患阴囊炎者还多于久居南方的人。原因何在？这是将来研究的新问题。
    （四）环境卫生问题：某军在环境卫生上已有相当的基础，在调查三十个连队之后，我们知道在技术上还有许多需要改进的地方。例如水井和厕所地址的选择；过滤砂石层的层薄不合规矩，滤出的水比未滤前还混浊；痰盂口过小，颇有描准吐痰之苦；还有一些未被注意的卫生建设如厨房的污水、除油池、垃圾桶等，但经过宣传解释并介绍了切合实际的卫生建设方法后，启发了他们的创造力，因而创造出来更能适用的土制冲水厕所等。目前该军环境卫生的设备，普遍提高了一步。
    （五）卫生教育方面：
    （１）普遍提高了指战员对江南疾病的预防知识：在三次工作中，我们一共接触了八万以上的战士和干部。我们除了用一部分电影进行宣传教育外，还配合部队实际情况，特别为战士们设计了十余种幻灯片和十多种展览材料。根据测验的结果，战士们的卫生常识在受教育前平均分数为七十五分，受教育后八十二分。
    通过了这些材料，战士们认识了疾病是可以预防的，对预防工作有了信心。过去有些人不明了卫生是“为什么”？有人是为了服从上级的命令来作一些卫生工作。在进行了宣传教育之后，战士们能自觉自愿地推行卫生制度和改善环境卫生了，使连队卫生工作获得了新的开展。
    （２）了解部队卫生情况，提供了改进意见：过去部队因忙于作战救护，对卫生教育进行没有系统。方式呆板，未发挥最大效果。有的在四个月内只上了二次卫生课，有的在讲人体构造时钻牛角尖，把重要的生理知识忽略了我们之为此提供了一些改善的意见（例如每周上课一次，以江南的疾病传染和预防为重点），辅助军政干部亲自给战士讲卫生课，加强干部卫生教育，充分利用有艺术天才的干部绘画卫生教育挂图等。又将预防江南各种重要疾病预防的方法归纳为“十种常规卫生制度”，号召全军一致执行，对今后防病工作必有相当作用。
    （３）协助部队开展社会卫生：战士们工作学习之后，便共同协助了当地的老百姓把危害健康的环境改善。如某团四连已经和当地的老百姓联合组织地方防病委员会。战士们为老百姓掘井，并规定不许在河内洗马桶等。战士们又协助当地把全村的粪缸迁移村外。各地这样的作下去，不仅部队卫生有了保障，同时也有助于地方卫生工作的改进。
