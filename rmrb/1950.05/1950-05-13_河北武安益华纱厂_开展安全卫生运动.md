　　【Baoding News from this Newspaper】The state-owned Yihua Cotton Mill in Wu'an, Hebei Province, actively implements the instructions of the Provincial People's Government, the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, and the Production Office on carrying out safety and hygiene work in factories and mines. The Party, government, and labor union in the factory closely cooperated, first conducting ideological mobilization among the workers, making everyone aware of the importance of safety and hygiene work and the problems existing in the factory. Then, a safety and hygiene committee was established, hygiene groups were established in the workers' dormitories, a hygiene code was discussed and adopted, and a work plan for the safety and hygiene campaign week was formulated, stipulating a regular safety and hygiene inspection system. All more than 400 employees participated in this movement.
    In terms of safety and hygiene facilities, three new-style toilets were built, and heating is being prepared for the toilets near the workshops to appropriately regulate the winter temperature. Three bathhouses for male and female workers have been built. A barbershop and a clinic (with Chinese and Western doctors) have been established. Sixteen washbasins were newly issued to the workers' dormitories. There is also a tea stove, with a dedicated person responsible for boiling water. In the workshops, each person is given two masks. During the major inspection and cleanup, machine parts such as electric rollers and line shafts in the workshop were sorted out. In the kitchen, a dirty water ditch was repaired and added, and water tank lids, bowl racks, gauze, aprons, and rags were prepared.
    During this safety and hygiene campaign, the factory has achieved great results. In the future, it should strengthen worker hygiene education and improve safety and hygiene work on the existing foundation. (Labor Protection Department of the Hebei Provincial Federation of Trade Unions)

    【本报保定讯】河北武安公营益华纱厂积极执行省人民政府、省总工会、产办处关于开展厂矿安全卫生工作的指示，厂内党、政、工密切配合，首先在职工中进行了思想动员，让大家认识安全卫生工作的重要性，及本厂所存在的问题，接着成立了安全卫生委员会，在工人宿舍建立了卫生小组，讨论通过卫生公约，制订了安全卫生运动周的工作计划，规定了安全卫生的经常检查制度。全体职工四百余人，都投入了这一运动。
    在安全卫生设备上，建立了新型厕所三处，在工房附近的厕所还准备装置暖气，适当调剂冬季温度。建立职工男女澡塘三个。理发室一所，诊疗室一所（内有中、西医生）。工人宿舍增发脸盆十六个。另设有茶炉，由专人负责烧水。在工房车间内，每人发给口罩二个。在大检查大扫除中，把车间的电滚、天轴……等机器零件加以整理。伙房方面，修添了脏水沟一条，制备了水缸盖、碗架、纱布、围裙、抹布等。
    在这次安全卫生运动中，该厂是取得了很大的成绩。今后，应该加强职工卫生教育，把安全卫生工作在现有基础上提高一步。（河北省总工会劳保部）
