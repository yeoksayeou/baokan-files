　　All-China Railway Federation
　　Railway Committee of the Communist Youth League Convene Technical Study Conference
　　Decide to Massively Train Skilled Workers
　　The Main Methods are to Promote Apprenticeship Contracts and Run Technical Study Classes
    [This newspaper reports] The All-China Railway Federation and the National Railway Committee of the Communist Youth League convened a technical study work conference on April 26th. The conference summarized the experiences of various regions in organizing railway workers to study technology and decided to vigorously organize technical studies and systematically train skilled workers.

    In the first quarter of this year, railways in various regions have launched work to organize technical studies. According to statistics from the Northeast Railway Bureau and the Tianjin, Jinan, and Taiyuan Railway Bureaus, 4,649 apprentices and 3,287 masters have signed 3,915 "Technical Study Contracts." Meanwhile, five railway units in Tianjin, Jinan, Taiyuan, Jilin, and Harbin have opened 235 technical training classes with 8,480 students. The two items combined, the number of workers engaged in technical studies has reached 13,129.

    However, the scale of this work has not kept up with the current production needs and the demands of the masses. The plan for training skilled workers is still somewhat blind. The organizational forms, teaching materials, teachers, and reward methods for technical studies have not been specifically resolved. The division of labor and cooperation among the administrative, trade union, and Communist Youth League leaders of railways in various regions is not scientific and close enough. In addition, some cadres still have erroneous understandings of this work, either blindly satisfied with the status quo or thinking that "technical study is important, but it's a long-term solution that won't solve the immediate problem; it's faster to solve it from the attitude of labor." Some even think that "the staffing is limited, and neither upgrades nor salary increases are possible; it's useless to improve technology."

    The meeting criticized these erroneous understandings and pointed out the necessity of improving technology: According to the statistics of 410 accidents in the locomotive bureaus in January and February of this year, as many as 83 cases were caused by reckless signals due to poor operating skills. Due to the development of the people's railway cause, the shortage of skilled railway workers nationwide is no less than 35,000.

    The meeting studied several main organizational forms and leadership methods for organizing technical studies. One of the more commonly used methods in various regions is the method of signing "master-apprentice teaching contracts" (including single contracts with one master and one apprentice, and multi-apprentice contracts with one master and several apprentices). This method is to study on-site, learn while working, simple and easy to implement, not limited by time and material conditions, and can enable apprentices to quickly learn the ability of practical operation. However, the weakness is that most masters only have practical experience and cannot enable apprentices to learn more technical theory.

    Another method is to organize technical study classes of the same business (such as stoker classes, driver classes, locomotive acceptance inspector classes, etc.), mainly to improve the technical theoretical level and proficiency of employees with certain technical skills. The advantage of this form is that it can accommodate a large number of people, and collective learning is more effective. Moreover, according to the nature of the business, all kinds of technical workers can be organized separately to study the technical principles and practical operation methods necessary for the unit. It is also possible to organize the study of a certain advanced working method or advanced production experience.

    The meeting believes that these two forms are complementary, and various regions should, according to the specific situation and combined with the needs of current production, focus on gaining experience and then widely promoting them. In addition, attention should be paid to adopting methods such as seminars, lectures, short training courses, bulletins, and special publications to disseminate new working methods and production experiences, and to complement each other with the promotion of rationalization proposals. In areas where conditions permit, it is also possible to consult with the administration to pilot regular technical schools.

　　中国铁路工会
　  青年团铁路工委召开技术学习会议
　　决大量培养技术工人
　　主要方法是推广师徒合同开办技术学习班
    【本报讯】中国铁路工会与青年团全国铁路工委于四月廿六日召开了技术学习工作会议，总结了各地组织铁路工人学习技术的经验，决定大力组织技术学习，有计划地培养技术工人。
    本年第一季中，各地铁路已展开了组织技术学习的工作。据东北铁路总局和天津、济南、太原三铁路局统计，已有四、六四九名学徒与三、二八七名师傅订立了三、九一五件“技术学习合同”；同时天津、济南、太原、吉林、哈尔滨五处铁路单位共开办了技术训练班二三五处，有学员八、四八○名。两项合计，从事技术学习的工人已达一三、一二九名。
    但此项工作开展的规模尚赶不上目前生产需要和群众的要求；培养技术工人的计划还多少带有盲目性；学习技术的组织形式、教材、教员、奖励办法等问题亦未具体解决；各地铁路的行政、工会与青年团领导的分工配合还不够科学与密切。此外，有些干部对此项工作尚存有错误认识，或盲目地满足现状；或认为“技术学习固然重要，但远水不解近渴，还是从劳动态度解决快”；甚至以为“定员有限制，既不升级又不能增薪，技术提高了没用。”
    会议批判了这些错误认识，指出提高技术的必要：据机务局今年一、二月份四百一十件事故的统计，因操纵技术不良冒进信号者达八十三件之多。由于人民铁道事业的发展，全国铁路技术工人的缺额不下三万五千人。
    会议研究了组织技术学习的几种主要的组织形式和领导方法。各地比较普遍采用的一种是订立“师徒教学合同”办法（包括一师一徒的单一合同，一师数徒的多徒合同等）。这种方法是在现场学习，边作边学，简便易行，不受时间与物质条件的限制，能使学徒很快地学会实际作业的能力。但弱点是师傅大多只有实际经验，而不能使学徒学到更多的技术理论。
    另一种是组织同一业务的技术学习班（如司炉班、司机班、机车验收员班等），主要是提高已有一定技术的职工的技术理论水平与熟练程度。这种形式的好处是容纳人数较多，集体学习收效较大，而且可以按照业务性质，把各种业务的技术工人，都分别组织起来，学习本单位所必需的技术原理和实际作业方法；也可以组织某一种先进工作方法或先进生产经验的学习。
    会议认为这两种形式是互相配合的，各地应根据具体情况，结合当前生产的需要，有重点地取得经验后广泛推行。此外，要注意采用座谈会、讲演会、短训班、通报、专刊等方法，传播新的工作方法和生产经验，并与推广合理化建议相辅而行。在有条件的地区，还可商同行政，试办正规的技术学校。
