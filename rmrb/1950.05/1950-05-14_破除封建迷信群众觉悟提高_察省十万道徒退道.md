Breaking Superstition and Raising Mass Awareness
　　Chahar Province: 100,000 Daoist Followers Renounce Daoism

　　[Zhangjiakou News] According to the Chahar Daily News: The anti-superstition movement in Chahar Province has achieved great success. From last winter to the end of March this year, various localities, through cadre meetings at all levels, representative meetings, training classes, mass meetings, and winter schools, have used rooftop broadcasts, blackboard newspapers, theatrical performances, individual propaganda, and other methods to expose the deceptive and harmful activities of feudal superstitious Daoist sects in deceiving and poisoning the masses, spreading rumors, and disrupting the work of the government. Some areas even calculated the exploitation accounts of Yiguandao altar leaders for the masses. According to statistics from village representatives of Sunjiabao and Guoleizhuang villages in Wanquan, Daoist followers in the village had to give a total of 260 shi of millet to the altar leader each year. After the masses understood these situations, they renounced Daoism one after another. At the same time, various localities also publicized the government's lenient policy to the Daoist leaders and heads of societies, and mobilized them to register their renunciation of Daoism. As of the end of March, a total of 3,517 feudal superstitious Daoist leaders and heads of societies in twenty-two counties had registered their renunciation of Daoism; and 95,830 Daoist followers in twenty-five counties had renounced Daoism. After this anti-feudal and anti-superstition movement, the masses' awareness has been greatly improved, and they are very satisfied. For example, many people in Yanqing reflected: "It should have been rectified long ago. They secretly do no good things all day long, only harming people!" The masses in Yanggao happily said: "Now we can produce with peace of mind! The rumors are stopped."

　　察省十万道徒退道
    【张家口讯】据察哈尔日报消息：察省反封建迷信运动已获很大成绩。自去冬至今年三月底，各地通过各级干部会、代表会、训练班、群众大会以及冬学等场合，利用屋顶广播、黑板报、演剧、个别宣传等方式，揭穿封建迷信道门欺骗毒害群众与造谣生事、捣乱政府工作的行为，有的地区还给群众算一贯道坛主的剥削账。据万全孙家堡、郭磊庄两村的村代表统计，每年村内道徒一共要给坛主拿去小米二百六十石。群众明了这些情形后，均纷纷退道。同时，各地又向道首、会首们宣传政府的宽大政策，动员他们登记退道。截至三月底止，二十二个县已登记退道的封建迷信道首、会首共三千五百十七人；二十五个县退道道众已达九万五千八百三十人。经过这次反封建、迷信运动，群众觉悟大大提高，觉得很满意。如延庆很多人反映：“早就该整整，一天家偷偷摸摸不干好事，尽害人！”阳高群众高兴地说：“这回可放心生产吧！耳边风（谣言）堵死了。”
