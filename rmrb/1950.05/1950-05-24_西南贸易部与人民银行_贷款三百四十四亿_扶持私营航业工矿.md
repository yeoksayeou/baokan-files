　　Southwest Trade Department and People's Bank
    Loan 34.4 Billion to Support Private Shipping, Industrial, and Mining Enterprises
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 22nd: The Southwest Military and Administrative Committee's Trade Department and the Chongqing Branch of the People's Bank of China, along with the Bank of Communications, have loaned a total of 34.4 billion RMB in the past four months to support private shipping, industrial, and mining enterprises in Chongqing. More than fifty units have received loans, mainly to solve difficulties in raw materials, capital, and product transportation and sales. After receiving a loan of 11.6 billion RMB, the Sichuan Silk Company used all of it to purchase silkworm cocoons in rural areas, which not only solved the company's raw material source but also indirectly helped silkworm farmers in the silk-producing areas of Southern and Northern Sichuan. The Chongqing Electric Power Company used the loan to repair its third power plant. Private shipping companies received a total loan of 4.4 billion RMB, which will be used to repair ships and strengthen water transportation. The Southwest Trade Department also solved the fuel difficulties for private shipping companies during the flood season and has stored 16,000 tons of coal for the companies (approximately valued at more than 6 billion RMB), which will be transported to Wanxian, Fengjie, and other places along the Yangtze River for storage. This measure also partially solved the problem of coal sales.
