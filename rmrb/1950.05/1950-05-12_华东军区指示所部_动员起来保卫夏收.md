Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 10th. As the summer harvest approaches in East China, the East China Military Region and the Political Department of the Third Field Army Headquarters have issued instructions on safeguarding the summer harvest. They call on all military units and field armies in East China to mobilize and earnestly carry out the work of safeguarding the summer harvest. The instructions point out: In order to complete the battle preparations for liberating the islands and straits along the southeast coast and liberating Taiwan, and to solve the problem of military and civilian food supplies, it is necessary to do a good job in safeguarding the summer harvest. At the same time, after the complete defeat of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang on the mainland, they are strengthening their activities of bandits and secret agents in the liberated areas. Therefore, we must be especially vigilant against the sabotage activities of bandits and secret agents during the summer harvest period. We must protect the immediate interests of the masses with practical actions to protect the summer harvest, and combine this with helping the masses with the summer harvest to further educate the masses, so as to better unite the masses and lay a broad mass foundation for further eliminating bandits and secret agents. The instructions stipulate that local armed forces and main force units responsible for suppressing bandits in various places should regard the work of safeguarding the summer harvest as the central task during the summer harvest period. The entire army should speak out and carry out propaganda work, mobilize the masses to protect food and defend themselves, and, according to the arrangements of the local people's government, assist the local people's armed forces in mobilizing and organizing the protection of the summer harvest. In the old liberated areas, under the call to mobilize the people's armed forces to protect the summer harvest, the construction of the militia should be further strengthened.
