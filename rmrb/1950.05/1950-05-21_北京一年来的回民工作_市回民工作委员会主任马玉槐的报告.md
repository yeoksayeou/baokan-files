　　Beijing's Work with Hui People in the Past Year
　　Report by Ma Yuhuai, Director of the Municipal Hui People's Work Committee

　　(1) The Establishment of the Hui Committee

　　After the liberation of Beijing, more than 60,000 Hui compatriots gained new lives with equality, democracy, and freedom. However, due to the national oppression and instigation policies implemented by the Kuomintang reactionary government in the past, on the one hand, Han chauvinism was created and developed among Han compatriots, and on the other hand, narrow nationalism was deepened and fostered among Hui compatriots, thus forming a bad relationship between the Han and Hui peoples. Influenced by the rumors and slanderous propaganda of reactionary factions inside and outside the nation, many Hui compatriots harbored misunderstandings and fears about the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Government, and the People's Liberation Army, or individually held a blind hostile attitude. Coupled with the rumors spread by special agents, in the early days of liberation, a small number of Hui compatriots showed unease and some unfounded rumors occurred, causing some misunderstandings. In order to stabilize the hearts of the Hui people, deeply publicize the Communist Party's and the People's Government's national policies of national equality and freedom of religious belief, and ensure the smooth implementation of destroying the old order and establishing a revolutionary order; and in order to better listen to the opinions of the Hui compatriots, overcome shortcomings in the work, explain misunderstandings and expose rumors, and resolve the urgent problems of the Hui people as appropriately as possible, so as to achieve further unity and friendship between the Han and Hui nationalities, the Beijing Municipal People's Government decided to establish the Beijing Municipal People's Government Hui People's Work Committee.

　　(2) Our Work

　　In view of the situation at the time, we first universally and deeply publicized the policies of the Communist Party and the People's Government through various forms and opportunities, while handling some inter-ethnic disputes (15 major ones). After a short period of time, the vast majority of Hui compatriots basically understood the spirit of national equality, unity, friendship, and cooperation, removed their fears, and were able to seek reasonable solutions to certain problems based on this spirit (such as the Jianye Bookstore and the Ma Dian garrison incidents). As they understood the policies, the broad masses of Hui compatriots gradually put forward their urgent demands—such as supporting and developing private schools for Hui people, clearing up the share capital of credit cooperatives sponsored by the puppet Hui Islamic Association, training and cultivating Hui cadres to participate in work, and supporting and developing Hui welfare undertakings, etc.

　　Based on these requirements and the government's established policies, we gradually and appropriately resolved the following issues:

　　A. In terms of culture, education, and cadre training, we made every effort to support and develop Hui schools and social education undertakings. First, we submitted a request to the Ministry of Education for secondary schools and successively took over the former National Chengda Normal School, Private Northwest Middle School, and Private Yanshan Middle School to form the National Hui College and added a female normal school class. Secondly, for each elementary school, in addition to the former national and municipal ones being uniformly taken over, nine of the nineteen private elementary schools were given financial subsidies. The subsidy funds increased from 4,620 jin last year to 19,222 jin of rice per semester this year. The amount of the subsidy is determined according to the specific circumstances of each school, rather than being evenly distributed. This not only maintained but also developed elementary school education, giving 6,307 students (including some Han students) the opportunity to study. Thirdly, in social education, 13 literacy classes were formed, including young people, women, and children, divided into 30 classes, with 2,229 students. This solved the learning needs of adult men and women and out-of-school children. Regarding the training, cultivation, and promotion of Hui cadres, we have successively introduced about 400 people to study at Hua University, Revolutionary University, the Municipal Party Committee Cadre Training Class, the Public Security School, and the Military and Political Cadre School. About 50 cadres have also been trained in the work and have been assigned to work in various levels of government organs, schools, and factories. Through the above efforts, we have laid a preliminary foundation for our Hui people's culture, education, and other work.

　　B. We organized and led 1,578 cooperative members, divided into 137 groups, to elect representatives to form a committee to clean up the Hui Islamic Association Credit Cooperative, conducted investigations of accounts, pursued responsibilities, and recovered share capital. After half a year, it was calculated that there were seven properties (about 140 rooms) and 23 ivory figures, jade bottles, etc. (these items have been sold for a total price of 11 million yuan RMB, equivalent to about 10,000 jin of rice). This was used as share capital to invest in production and jointly operate a coal kiln with others. Two months later, feeling that joint operation was inappropriate, the contract has now been abolished and the original state has been maintained. Basically, the 2,700 members' share capital that had been seized was recovered, safeguarding the economic interests of the masses.

　　C. Regarding the welfare undertakings of the Hui people, we took over the former Puji Charity Hospital, renamed it the Hui People's Hospital, and increased the monthly subsidy from 1,000 jin of millet to 1,500 jin to 2,500 jin of rice this year, so that poor Hui people can receive free treatment, which has provided a certain guarantee for the health of the broad masses of Hui people. In order to solve the problem of the masses' difficulty in purchasing grain during price fluctuations, three consumer cooperatives were organized, absorbing 3,702 Hui members (excluding the Hui College Cooperative). 324 unemployed people were introduced to jobs. In terms of living habits, we helped government organs, factories, and schools with a certain number of Hui people establish Hui canteens. In addition, appropriate handling or assistance was provided for issues such as real estate tax on mosques, transformation of backward industries, immigration, promotion of public bonds, and supply of "Hailifan" (i.e., mosque students).

　　(3) Current Situation

　　Due to the implementation of the national policy in the Common Program and the factual education of the people of the city in the past year, the ideas of Han chauvinism and narrow nationalism have been largely overcome. Some major practical problems have also been basically resolved. The Hui masses have realized the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, thus laying a preliminary foundation for national unity in building the capital. However, due to deep historical reasons and the fact that liberation has not been long, there are still some problems and work that deserve our attention:

　　A. First of all, our Hui compatriots cannot yet properly solve problems based on the spirit of unity of being lenient to others and strict with oneself in inter-ethnic disputes, and often only talk about one-sided truths. This is mainly reflected in the following issues: For example, in terms of living habits, they only ask others to respect and take care of themselves, but not to respect and take care of others. For example, in Shucun, a house that originally belonged to a Hui landlord was allocated to Han and Hui people to live together. The Han residents wanted to change the "Dua Yi" pasted on the door into Spring Festival couplets, but the Hui people did not agree and wanted to make trouble for them. Some people often emphasize the enjoyment of rights to the government, but disregard the undertaking of obligations, and when they encounter difficulties, they only want to ask for help from others but lack the spirit of overcoming them themselves. For example, regarding the subsidy of school funds, they repeatedly ask the government for help, but passively resist or emphasize difficulties in paying taxes. Of course, some Han compatriots or individual cadres also lack understanding of the problems of the Hui people, or there are some shortcomings in the work, which are also worth reviewing. That is to say, we cannot better embody the spirit of equality, unity, mutual assistance, and actively overcoming difficulties in practical problems.

　　B. Due to the success of the Chinese people's liberation cause, fundamental changes have taken place in China's politics and economy. As a result, there are certain phenomena in the Beijing market where some industries that used to serve feudal luxury goods, etc., are being eliminated or their business is sluggish, and this has caused unemployment among workers in these industries and difficulties in the lives of some people. This is a major practical problem at present, and we should strive to solve it in the future. However, regarding the reasons for this phenomenon, we should recognize that the first reason is that these industries do not serve the people, and their elimination or sluggishness is inevitable. Secondly, we are still carrying out large-scale wars and healing the wounds left by years of war, so the government cannot immediately take out more funds to open factories to solve today's difficulties. At the same time, this is a common difficulty problem in victory, and it is by no means unique to the Hui people, and the Hui people are still a small part of the whole problem. Finally, we should also clearly see that the erroneous behaviors of certain capitalists escaping funds and deceiving workers have deepened our difficulties.

　　C. Regarding the disposal of the property cleaned out from the former credit cooperative, it is correct for the broad masses of members to advocate starting production undertakings. In the past, we failed to do a good job because we lacked production experience, and we also lacked a democratic style and failed to convene the broad masses of members to conduct discussions and give play to the wisdom and talents of the masses. This was wrong in the past. Now that various procedures have been completed, we should turn this dead property into living capital and start production undertakings. At the same time, the Clean-up Committee should be ended immediately, and a Production Committee should be formed, and the management rights of all property should be handed over to this production organization.

　　(4)

　　In the past year, through the efforts of all parties, the general and major problems of the Hui people have been basically resolved. Therefore, the Hui Committee has completed its task and has been ordered to be abolished. In the future, the Department of Ethnic Affairs of the Civil Affairs Bureau will be responsible for handling the regular affairs between ethnic groups. At the same time, in order to make the problems of our Hui compatriots resolved in a timely and convenient manner and to deepen the work, the People's Government will assign and promote a group of Hui cadres to work in various district governments (district offices) and public security stations. This will strengthen the direct connection between the government and our Hui compatriots. Everyone must recognize that this is not a weakening but a strengthening of the work with the Hui people. Doing so will make governments at all levels and people's organizations pay attention to the work of the Hui people, which is very beneficial to the improvement and development of the Hui people in all aspects.

　　Finally, we should understand that the reason why we have today and a bright future is because of the leadership of the Communist Party and the leadership of our wise leader Chairman Mao. Therefore, we should thank Chairman Mao, thank the Communist Party, thank the People's Government, and thank the People's Liberation Army. Let us shout:

　　Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
　　Long live Chairman Mao!
　　Long live the People's Government!
　　Long live the People's Liberation Army!
　　Long live the unity of all ethnic groups!

　　北京一年来的回民工作
    市回民工作委员会主任马玉槐的报告
    （一）回委会的建立
    北京解放后六万多回民同胞是获得平等民主自由的新生了。但是，由于过去国民党反动政府所实行的民族压迫和民族挑拨政策，一方面在汉族同胞中制造和发展了大汉族主义思想，一方面在回族同胞中加深与助长了狭隘民族主义思想，因而形成了汉回两族人民间的恶劣关系；由于民族内外反动派造谣污蔑等武断宣传的影响，使得很多回民同胞对中国共产党，对人民政府和人民解放军存有不少的误解和疑惧心理，或个别的抱有一种盲目的敌对态度，加以特务的造谣，所以在解放初期回族同胞中少数人表现不安并且发生了一些无中生有的谣言，引起一些误会。北京市人民政府为了安定回胞的人心，深入宣传共产党与人民政府的民族平等、信仰自由的民族政策，并保证顺利执行摧毁旧秩序建立革命秩序；又为了更好的听取回民同胞的意见，克服工作中的缺点，解释误会和揭穿谣言并尽可能适当的解决回民的迫切问题，以达到回汉民族进一步的团结和友爱，所以决定建立北京市人民政府回民工作委员会。
    （二）我们的工作
    针对当时的情况，我们首先通过各种形式，用各种机会普遍深入宣传共产党和人民政府的政策，同时结合着处理了一些民族间的纠纷事件（较大者有十五件）。这样经过了短短的时间就使广大回胞基本上了解了民族平等团结、友爱合作的精神，去掉疑惧心理，对发生的某些问题能本此精神求得合理之解决（如建业书局及马甸驻军等事）。广大回胞随着对政策的了解，便逐渐的提出了他们的迫切要求——如扶植与发展回民私立学校，清理伪回教协会主办的信用合作社股金，训练和培养回民干部参加工作，扶植与发展回民福利事业等等。
    我们根据这些要求本政府的既定政策逐步的适当的解决了以下问题：
    甲、在文化教育和培养干部方面，尽力扶植与发展回民的学校及社教事业，首先对中等学校呈请教育部批准，先后接管了前国立成达师范、私立西北中学和私立燕山中学合并组成国立回民学院并增加了女简师一班。其次对各小学除前国立的和市立的一律接管外，并对十九处私立小学中的九处加以经济的补助，补助的经费由去年的四六二○斤增加到今年的每学期一九二二二斤米。补助的数目是根据各校的具体情况决定，而不是平均分配的。这不但维持而且发展了小学教育。使六三○七名同学（内有一部汉民）得到了学习机会。三是社会教育上组成了识字班十三处，计青壮年、妇女、儿童，共分成三十个班，有学生二二二九人。这就解决了成年男女和失学儿童的学习要求。关于训练培养与提拔回民干部的工作，我们先后介绍到华大、革大、市委干训班、公安学校、军政干校学习的约有四百余人，在工作中也培养了干部约五十余人，已分配到各级机关学校工厂中工作。经过以上努力，给我们回族的文化教育及其他工作打下了初步的基础。
    乙、组织和领导了一五七八户社员划为一三七个小组选出代表组成清理回协信用合作社委员会，进行了清查账目、追究责任、要回股金的工作。经过了半年的时间，算出房产七所（约一四○间），象牙人、玉瓶等二十三件（此物已卖出共价洋一千一百万人民币折米约一万余斤），并以此为股金投入生产与人合资经营煤窑，两月后因感合资经营不适当，现已废除合同保持了原本。基本上追回了二七○○个社员已被侵夺去的股金，保障了群众的经济利益。
    丙、在对回民的福利事业上我们代管了前普慈施医院，改名为回民医院，由每月补助小米一千斤，又增加到今年的每月一千五百斤米到二千五百斤米，使贫苦回民可以免费治疗，对广大回民的健康有了一定的保障。为了解决物价波动时群众购粮困难的问题，组织了消费合作社三处，吸收了三七○二个回民社员入股（回民学院合作社在外），为失业者介绍职业的有三二四人。在生活习惯上对有一定数量回民的机关、工厂、学校帮助他们建立了回民伙房。此外在清真寺房地产税、落后行业转业、移民、推销公债、海里凡（即清真寺学员）供给问题上都分别作了适当的处理或帮同解决。
    （三）目前情况
    由于贯彻了共同纲领中的民族政策和一年来工作中的事实教育了全市的人民，使大汉族主义和狭隘民族主义的思想大部分已被克服了。一些较重大的实际问题也已基本上获得了解决。回民群众已体会到了中国共产党和人民政府的英明领导，因此初步打下了民族团结共建首都的基础。但是由于深远的历史原因和解放还不久，所以还有些问题和工作值得我们注意：
    甲、首先是我们回族同胞对民族间所发生的纠纷还不能很好的本待人宽责己严的团结精神来合理的解决问题，往往只讲片面的道理；这主要的表现在以下问题上：如生活习惯上只要求别人尊重照顾自己，而不是尊重照顾别人，例如在树村有一所原来是回民地主的房屋分配给汉民回民共同居住，汉民住户涂改贴在门上的“都阿一”想换成春联，回民便不答应，而且要找人家的麻烦。有些人对政府则往往强调权利的享受，而不顾义务的承担，遇有困难只想要求别人的帮助而自己欠缺克服的精神。如对学校经费的补助，一再向政府要求，而对纳税则消极抵抗或强调困难。当然汉民同胞或个别干部也有对回民问题体谅不够，或工作中的一些缺点，也值得提出检讨的，这就是说我们对平等团结、互助、积极克服困难的精神还不能更好的在实际问题上体现出来。
    乙、由于中国人民解放事业的成功，中国政治经济已发生根本的变化，因而在北京的市面上有某些过去服务于封建的奢侈品等行业的被淘汰或生意萧条的现象，和因此引起的这些行业中的工人失业和部分人民的生活困难。这是当前的重大的实际的问题，是我们今后应当努力加以解决的。但对这种现象产生的原因，我们应当认识到首先是因为这些行业不是服务于人民的，他们的被淘汰或萧条是势所必然。其次是我们目前还在进行着大规模的战争和医治着连年战争所遗留下来的创伤，因而政府不可能马上拿出更大的资金来开办工厂解决今天的困难。同时这是胜利中的普遍困难问题。而决非回民所独有，而且回民还是整个问题的一小部分，最后我们还应当清楚的看到某些资本家逃避资金欺骗工人等错误行为，也就加深了我们的困难。
    丙、对清理出前信用合作社的财产处理，广大社员主张开办生产事业是正确的，过去我们因为缺少生产经验未能做好，又加以缺乏民主作风，未能召集广大社员展开讨论，发挥群众的智慧才能，这是过去的不对，现在各种手续已办清，今后应将此死的房产变为活的资本，开办生产事业。同时清理委员会应即结束，另组生产委员会，并将全部财产的管理权交给这个生产组织。
    （四）
    一年来，经过各方面的努力，已将回民中一般性的较重大的问题，获得了基本上的解决，因此回委会完成了他的任务而奉命撤消，今后对民族间经常性的事务问题，由民政局民族事务科负责处理。同时为了使我们回族同胞的问题解决及时便利和工作更加深入起见，人民政府将分配和提拔一批回民干部到各区政府（区公所）和公安派出所去工作。这样就可以加强政府与我们回胞的直接联系。大家必须认清，这不是对回民工作的削弱而是加强。这样做将使各级政府各人民团体，都会注意起回民工作来，对回民各方面的提高与发展上是很有利的。
    最后我们应当明了，我们之所以有了今天有了光明的未来，是因为共产党的领导，我们英明领袖毛主席的领导，因此我们应当感谢毛主席，感谢共产党，感谢人民政府，感谢人民解放军，让我们高呼：
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
    人民政府万岁！
    人民解放军万岁！
    各族人民的团结万岁！
