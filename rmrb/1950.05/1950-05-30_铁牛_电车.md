Xinhua News Agency and our correspondent in Moscow, Li He

We know that there is an Iron Ox locomotive on the Northeast Railway, which has broken through two Class A inspection periods and traveled 100,06579.1 kilometers, maintaining the locomotive's good condition. This is the result of learning from advanced Soviet experience and implementing a full crew responsibility system on the locomotive. Now, Polina Donnikova, a female trolley driver in Moscow, has proposed promoting the responsibility system on trolleys and all other urban transportation. She has proven through her own experience that this can extend the service life of transportation vehicles, making trolleys also become "Iron Oxen."

Originally, there was a movement in Soviet industry for workers to be responsible for protecting machinery, and among Moscow's trolley workers, there was a movement to "Serve Passengers Well." Thousands of drivers are working hard to extend the service life of their vehicles in the "Serve Passengers Well" movement. On average, they all exceed the original standard by 10,000 kilometers, thus saving the country a lot of material and human resources. Donnikova's initiative arose on this basis. She applies the responsibility system of protecting machines in industry to the urban transportation industry to consolidate the existing "Serve Passengers Well" movement.

Donnikova has been driving trolley number 940 for several years. Every time the trolley completes a run, she checks it at the last stop, which prevents the possibility of the trolley breaking down midway. In the past year, trolley number 940 broke through the original overhaul period, exceeding the standard by more than double, traveling an additional 25,000 kilometers. She found that the reason for achieving this result was not only timely inspection and repair, but more importantly, dedicated personnel being responsible for protecting the machine. Therefore, she wrote a letter to the drivers of the Moscow transportation industry, proposing the following suggestions:

"………
Experience has proven that the vehicles that run continuously and regularly on the routes, and exceed the original overhaul period, are mainly those entrusted to certain drivers. I have been working on car No. 940 for several years. Therefore, I have studied the device of this car very well, and it is possible to pay attention to the machine situation every day and care about it. Our car is always in good condition and has never stopped. … The interests of the country and the interests of Moscow citizens urgently require every car to have a caring driver as the master, who is capable, knowledgeable, and knows the importance of the cause entrusted to him. I believe that every driver in the city transportation industry should implement socialist protection for his own car, for his own machine. … I believe that socialist protection for cars should be extended to the city transportation industry. I call on drivers of trolleybuses, buses, taxis, and trucks to launch such a competition, namely: to extend the service life of their vehicles, to serve the citizens of Moscow well, and to strive for the conservation of materials. ..." (This letter was published in the Moscow Evening News on April 18)

Donnikova's initiative has been welcomed and supported. The Presidium of the Moscow State Committee of the Public Enterprise Trade Union made a decision on April 18 to adopt Donnikova's initiative and will ask the Moscow Trolley Bureau, Trolleybus Bureau, and Bus Bureau to formulate rules for implementing the socialist protection responsibility system. The Trade Union State Committee called on the committees of all trolley factories and trolleybus factories to widely discuss and promote Donnikova's initiative among transportation workers. Excellent drivers of trolleys, trolleybuses, and automobiles have risen up to respond. The Moscow Bus Bureau originally had more than 3,000 drivers who drove 100,000 kilometers in the city without repairs, and now there are drivers who drive 200,000 kilometers without repairs, and drivers Stepan Bulbiega and Sergei Susskov of the Third Factory drive 300,000 kilometers without major repairs. They are all willing to accept the responsible protection system and strive for higher records.

### “铁牛”电车

　　“铁牛”电车
    新华社及本报驻莫斯科记者  李何
    我们知道东北铁路上有一个铁牛号机车，突破了两个甲检期，行走了十万零六千五百七十九点一公里，保持机车的良好状态。这是学习先进的苏联经验，在机车上实行全乘务组负责制的结果。现在，莫斯科的电车女司机波里纳·顿尼科娃提出了在电车和其他一切城市运输上推行负责制的创议。她以亲身的经验证明，这可以延长交通工具的行走期限，使电车也成“铁牛”。
    本来，在苏联工业中有一种工人负责保护机器的运动，在莫斯科的电车工人中有一种“好好为乘客服务”的运动。千百个司机都在“好好为乘客服务”的运动中努力延长车子的行走期限。他们平均都超过原定标准一万公里，因而替国家节省了许多物力人力。顿尼科娃的创议就是在这个基础上产生的。他把工业中保护机器的负责制运用到城市运输业中来巩固已有的“好好为乘客服务”运动。
    顿尼科娃几年来都驾驶着九四○号电车。车子每走一趟，她都要在最后一站检查一下，这样就阻止了车子中途发生故障的可能。在去年一年中，九四○号电车突破原定的检修期，超出标准一倍多，多行走了二万五千公里。他发现取得这样成绩的原因，不仅在于及时检查和修理，更重要的在于专人负责保护机器。因此，她写信给莫斯科市运输业的司机们，提出了如下的建议：
    “………
    经验证明：不间断地和定规地在路线上行驶，而且超过了原定的检修期的，主要是那些托付给一定的司机的车子。我在九四○号车子已经工作了几年。因此我很好研究了这车子的装置，而且有可能天天注意机器情况，关心地看住它。我们的车子总是完好的，从来没有停驶。……国家的利益，莫斯科市民的利益，迫切地要求每个车子有关心的司机作主人，他是能干的、有知识的、晓得委托给他的事业的重要性的。我认为，每一个市运输业的司机，都应当对自己的车子，对自己的机器实行社会主义的保护。……我认为，对车子施行的社会主义保护，应当推广到市运输业上去。我号召无轨电车、公共汽车、出租汽车、货车的司机，都展开这样的竞赛，即：延长自己车子的行走期限，好好为莫斯科市民服务，争取资料的节约。……”（这一封信发表于四月十八日莫斯科晚报上）
    顿尼科娃的创议，受到欢迎和支持。公共企业职工会莫斯科州委员会主席团于四月十八日作出了采纳顿尼科娃的创议的决定，将请莫斯科电车局、无轨电车局、公共汽车局拟订实行社会主义的保护负责制的规则。职工会州委员会号召一切电车厂、无轨电车厂的委员会在运输业工人中广泛地讨论和推广顿尼科娃的创议。电车、无轨电车、汽车的出色司机已起来响应。莫斯科公共汽车局原有三千多名在市内驾驶十万公里不用修理的司机，现在有驾驶二十万公里不用修理的，第三厂的司机斯铁潘·布尔别加和薛尔盖·苏斯科夫驾驶三十万公里不用大修理。他们都愿意接受负责保护制，争取更高的纪录。
