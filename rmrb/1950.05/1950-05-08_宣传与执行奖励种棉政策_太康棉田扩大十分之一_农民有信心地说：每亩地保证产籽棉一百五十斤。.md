　　Propaganda and Implementation of Cotton Planting Reward Policy
    Taikang Cotton Fields Expanded by One-Tenth
    Farmers Confidently Say: Guaranteed Yield of 150 Jin of Seed Cotton Per Mu.
    [Kaifeng News] According to Henan Daily News: The Taikang County People's Government in Henan Province vigorously leads and rewards cotton planting. 210,000 mu of cotton fields in the county have been fertilized and plowed, and are now being sown, exceeding the county's cotton planting area last year by one-tenth. The county is one of the cotton-producing areas in the province, with an average annual cotton planting area accounting for about one-tenth of the county's land. However, in the past, farmers lacked scientific cotton planting methods, and were helpless in the face of insect pests, resulting in fertile cotton fields yielding less than 100 jin of seed cotton per mu each year. In addition, cotton sales were sluggish during the Kuomintang rule, and cotton production gradually declined. Last year, the People's Government began to support and reward cotton planting, using a large amount of public grain to offset cotton in the autumn tax, with each jin of cotton being worth three jin more of wheat than the market price. Encouraged in all aspects, farmers reserved a large amount of land when planting wheat in preparation for planting cotton. In February of this year, the government also loaned out 30,000 jin of cotton seeds and 170,000 jin of wheat as cotton fertilizer to key cotton planting areas like Laozhong and Longqu as assistance. The Provincial Department of Agriculture also established a cotton planting guidance group in the Laozhong District to specifically lead the masses in cotton planting and carry out large-scale propagation of improved varieties (Ambassador Cotton). Under the call of "Deep plowing, careful cultivation, and more fertilizer, will increase production by an inch this year," the masses raised their production enthusiasm and reversed the idea of "bad land planting cotton without fertilizer," and actively cultivated and fertilized around the Qingming Festival. Wangzhuang farmers in the Eighth District braved the rain to haul manure to the cotton fields, with the whole village hauling 130 carts of fertilizer in one day. Recently, due to continuous spring rains, the cotton fields were soaked, and the farmers began plowing and harrowing for the second time and striving to apply more fertilizer. Farmers in Xietang Township, Laozhong District, collectively purchased oil cakes as fertilizer with cotton fertilizer loans, adding 50 jin of cake fertilizer per mu in addition to two carts of manure. The farmers are full of confidence and happily say: "We guarantee to increase the yield to 150 jin of seed cotton per mu." During sowing, many farmers in the three improved seed propagation townships of Xietang, Guili, and Lifeng in Laozhong District voluntarily combined to organize mutual assistance, and the guidance group also held cotton farmers' symposiums to exchange production experience. There are also plans to hold an achievement exhibition in the autumn and to evaluate labor models. Currently, Laozhong District has sown 7,087 mu of cotton, and the entire district will be able to sow more than 21,000 mu; other districts have also carried out seed selection and ash mixing during sowing. The county has 210,000 mu of cotton fields that are being sown, exceeding last year's total cotton planting area of 190,000 mu by 10%. Calculated on the basis of increasing the yield per mu from 90 jin to 120-130 jin, the total seed cotton output can be increased from 17.1 million jin to 25.2 million jin.

　　宣传与执行奖励种棉政策
    太康棉田扩大十分之一   
    农民有信心地说：每亩地保证产籽棉一百五十斤。
    【开封讯】据河南日报消息：河南太康县人民政府大力领导与奖励植棉，该县已有二十一万亩棉田施肥犁耙完竣，正进行播种，超过去年该县种棉面积十分之一。该县为本省产棉地之一，平均每年植棉面积约占全县土地十分之一。惟因过去农民缺乏科学的植棉方法，每遇虫害，皆束手无策，致使肥沃之棉田每年每亩产籽棉不及百斤，加之国民党统治时期棉花销路不畅，棉产逐渐衰减。去年人民政府即开始扶植与奖励种棉，秋征中以大量公粮折征棉花，每斤棉花比市价高小麦三斤，农民们在各方面鼓励下，种麦时纷纷留出多量土地，准备植棉。今年二月政府又以老冢、龙曲为植棉重点贷出棉种三万斤，棉肥贷款小麦十七万斤以作扶助；该省农业厅并在老冢区设立植棉指导组，具体领导群众植棉，有重点的进行良种（大使棉）繁殖。群众在“深耕细作多上粪，今年生产长一寸”的号召下，提高了生产情绪，扭转了“坏地种棉不上粪”的思想，于清明节前后，积极的耕耘与施肥。八区王庄农民冒雨向棉地拉粪，全村一天中拉肥一百三十车。近因春雨连绵，棉田浸湿，农民又开始犁耙第二遍，并争取多上粪。老冢区谢堂乡农民以棉肥贷款集体购买油饼作肥，每亩除上二车粪外，并增上饼肥五十斤。农民充满信心，愉快的说：“保证增到每亩一百五十斤籽棉的产量。”在播种中，老冢区谢堂、桂李、李风三个良种繁殖乡均有不少农民自愿结合组织互助，指导组并召开棉农座谈会，交流生产经验。还计划于秋后作成绩展览，评定劳动模范。现老冢区已播种棉花七千零八十七亩，全区将可播种二万一千多亩；全区将可播种二万一千多亩；其他各区在播种时亦都进行了选种与灰拌种工作。全县有二十一万亩棉田正着手播种，超过去年总植棉面积十九万亩的百分之十。以每亩产量由九十斤增至一百二三十斤计算，全部籽棉产量可由一千七百一十万斤增产到二千五百二十万斤。
