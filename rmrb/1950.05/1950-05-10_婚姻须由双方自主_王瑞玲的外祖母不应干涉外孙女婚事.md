　　Marriage Must Be Based on Mutual Consent
    Wang Ruiling's Maternal Grandmother Should Not Interfere in Her Granddaughter's Marriage
To the Editors:
    I am Duan Xiangwen from Nanshe Village, Qi County, Shanxi Province. My beloved Wang Ruiling is from Licun Village, Wenshui County, and she studied in my village from a young age. We fell in love while at school. Unfortunately, in the winter of 1947, the Yan Xishan bandit regime implemented "soldier-peasant unity" in various villages and conscripted me from school. However, we continued to care for each other lovingly and had already decided on marriage for life, but Ling's maternal grandmother's family insisted on obstructing it. Although our marriage did not succeed, we both made vows, waiting for a time of freedom to arrive. After Qi County was liberated, I returned home and learned that my beloved, along with her family and maternal grandmother's family, had moved to Beijing. Last April, a classmate told me Ling's address (No. 15, Qianwai Ganjing Alley, Beijing), and I sent her a letter. Unexpectedly, this letter fell into the hands of her family, who prevented Ling from seeing it. In October, I sent Ling another registered letter, which she actually received. In her reply, she tearfully told me about her situation after our separation and her current life, and told me about the suffering and lack of freedom in her feudal old family. Since then, we have exchanged letters and lived a life of love again, and decided to return this spring to get married. Who knew that Ling's maternal grandmother was determined to marry her to another man. As a result, she cries all day long, eats less, her body weakens, and she keeps saying she wants to commit suicide, which makes me very distressed and anxious. Yesterday, after reading the People's Government's Marriage Law published in the newspaper, I wrote this letter, requesting the editors to answer how to handle my marriage?

    Editor's Note: The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China clearly stipulates that marriage between men and women must be based entirely on the free will of both parties, and no third party is allowed to interfere. Wang Ruiling's maternal grandmother's insistence on obstructing her granddaughter's marriage is completely illegal.

　　婚姻须由双方自主
    王瑞玲的外祖母不应干涉外孙女婚事编辑同志：
    我是山西省祁县南社村人，我的爱人王瑞玲是文水县里村人，自幼在我村念书。我们在校时即相爱了，不幸在一九四七年冬阎匪在各村闹兵农合一，把我由学校抓去当兵。但我们仍是亲爱地互相关心着，而且已决定了终身婚事，只是玲之外祖母家执意阻挠。我们婚事虽已失败，但双方面却许下了盟誓，等待着一个自由的时期的到来。祁县解放后我回家时才知我爱人与家中及外祖母家迁往北京了。去年四月间同学把玲的住址告诉了我（北京前外甘井胡同十五号），我就给玲去了一封信，不料这封信落到她家庭手里，不让玲看见。十月间我又给玲寄了一封双挂号信，她真的收到了，回信中向我哭诉了别后的情况和她目前的生活，又告诉我在封建的旧家庭中苦闷不自由的情形。自此我俩书来信往，又过着爱的生活，并决定今春回来完婚。谁知玲的外祖母决心把她嫁给另一个男子。这样她便终日痛哭，饮食减少，身体衰弱下来，并口口声声说想自杀，使我很为难过与焦急。我昨天读到报上公布了人民政府婚姻法后便写了这封信，要求编辑同志解答，如何处理我的婚事？
                                                读者段祥文四月二十日
    编者按：中华人民共和国婚姻法上明确规定，男女结婚须双方本人完全自愿，不许第三者加以干涉。王瑞玲的外祖母执意阻挠其外孙女的婚事，是完全非法的。
