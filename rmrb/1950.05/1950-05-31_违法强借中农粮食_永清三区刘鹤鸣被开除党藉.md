　　Illegally Forcibly Borrowing Grain from Middle Peasants
    Liu Heming of the Third District of Yongqing Expelled from the Party
    Liu Heming, the organization committee member of the Communist Party branch in Liuzhuang Village, Third District of Yongqing County, Hebei Province, has consistently been unenthusiastic about production, has not worked well, and has undermined the policies of the Party and the People's Government, acting recklessly. The Party and the People's Government have educated him several times, but he has not repented. In March of last year, Liu Heming was experiencing financial difficulties and, instead of trying to engage in production, he forcibly borrowed 900 jin of grain from six middle-peasant households, including Liu Xifeng, Liu Yufa, and Liu Ze. After he sold the grain, he casually ate, drank, and wasted it.
    In September of last year, the village suffered from a flood, and the masses were experiencing financial difficulties. Liu Heming not only did not try to lead the masses in production to overcome the famine and solve the people's livelihood difficulties, but instead incited the masses not to produce. He spread rumors, saying: "This year is so bitterly flooded, what's the point of working? Whoever has [grain] should just eat from their own." This kind of thinking has had a negative impact on the masses, making them afraid to boldly engage in production.
    In order to maintain the purity of the Party, the Yongqing County Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to expel Liu Heming from the Party. It also held a mass meeting to announce the handling of this matter, explaining to the masses at the meeting that today the government not only protects the private property of farmers but also rewards everyone for engaging in production to become prosperous.
    Because Liu Heming had not yet returned the borrowed grain at the time, the County Committee ordered him to establish a contract with the borrowed households, guaranteeing that after the wheat harvest, before the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, he would return wheat at a rate of one dou for one dou. The county government also instructed the cadres of the district to be responsible for inspecting this, and if he fails to repay by the deadline, he will be sent to the People's Court for handling according to law.
    After this education, the masses in the village understood the Communist Party and the People's Government's policy of rewarding production, eliminated concerns about "labor not being thrifty" and "fear of standing out," and consolidated their enthusiasm for production.

　　违法强借中农粮食
    永清三区刘鹤鸣被开除党藉
    河北省永清县三区刘庄村中共支部组织委员刘鹤鸣，一贯不积极生产，不很好的工作，并破坏党和人民政府的政策，胡作乱为。党与人民政府曾对他进行了数次教育，但他仍不悔改。去年三月，刘鹤鸣生活困难，不仅不想法生产，反而向中农刘锡封、刘玉发、刘泽等六户强借粮九百斤。他把粮食变卖以后，即随便吃喝浪费。
    去年九月间，该村受了水灾，群众生活困难。刘鹤鸣不但不想法领导群众生产度荒，解决群众的生活困难，反而煽动群众不生产。他造谣说：“这年头水涝的这么苦，干什么呀？谁家有就吃谁家的。”他这种思想在群众中已造成不良影响，使群众不敢大胆生产。
    中共永清县委为了保持党的纯洁，决定开除刘鹤鸣的党籍。并召开了群众大会，宣布这件事的处理经过，在大会上向群众说明今天政府不仅要保护农民的私有财产，并且奖励大家生产致富。
    因为刘鹤鸣当时还不出借去的粮食，县委已令其给被借户订立契约，保证过了麦收，在阴历五月五日以前，一斗顶一斗归还小麦。县政府并责成该区干部负责检查，如果到期不还，就依法把他送人民法院处理。
    经过这一次的教育后，该村群众了解到共产党与人民政府奖励生产的政策，消除了“劳动不节约”、“怕冒尖”等思想顾虑，巩固了生产情绪。
