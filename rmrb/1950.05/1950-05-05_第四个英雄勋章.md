　　The Fourth Hero Medal
　　Ye Hua
　　Liu Kun, this name is very familiar among the workers in Northeast China. Since "August 15th," he has been awarded the hero medal three times. On January 20th, at the Hengyang Railway Bureau's celebration conference, he was awarded the title of Labor Hero of the Bureau for the fourth time.
　　The old hero is a highly skilled mechanic, but in the past, he never showed his skills. During the Japanese occupation of Northeast China, he once found an opportunity to pour water on the axles on a day when the temperature was forty degrees below zero, and a perfectly good locomotive could not run.
　　For more than ten years, he constantly tried to deal with the enemy, working carelessly and sabotaging a total of three good locomotives.
　　After liberation, the Communist Party nurtured this hero, and he was determined to serve the people and advance with victory. Last autumn, he went on a long journey to the south and was assigned to the Lechang Locomotive Depot as a military representative. Others asked him, "You are a locomotive repair worker, it must be difficult for you to shoulder such an important job now."
　　He said, "Difficult! As long as you learn slowly, any difficulty can be overcome." When working at the Lechang Locomotive Depot, once only five tons of coal remained. In order not to stop the trains from running, he looked everywhere. He personally took the lead, mobilizing everyone, and cleared out more than forty tons from the original coal pile.
　　In 1946, in the Northeast, the broken locomotives left by the enemy were unusable, and he took the lead in overcoming the difficulties. The Qiqihar Bureau completed 64 tons of freight and 400,000 tons of grain transport that winter, which was inseparable from his active work. Therefore, he was elected as a hero of the Qiqihar Bureau. Later, he encountered difficulties in the locomotive work in Harbin. The winter weather was cold, and the locomotive could not move after resting for five minutes. The old hero was transferred there as deputy section chief. He was not afraid of the cold. He had a saying: "You get cold if you don't move." After arriving there, the work quickly started. Where there is Liu Kun, the work unfolds.
　　The old hero has a great spirit and a broad mind. Sometimes he is misunderstood by others in his work, but he always patiently explains to others. He comes from a working-class background and understands workers in every way. Even if individual workers are somewhat backward, he patiently and earnestly educates them. In the new district, when a few backward workers engaged in theft, some cadres simply wanted to dismiss them. He said, "We must patiently persuade and educate them. In the past, the workers did not have enough to eat and drink, and the factory and the workers were enemies, why not steal? As long as they understand that the factory is their own, they will not steal again." From this, it shows that not only does he not separate from the masses in action, but his thoughts are also firmly integrated with the masses. Therefore, after half a year of work, he won his fourth hero medal.

### 第四个英雄勋章

　　第四个英雄勋章
    叶华
    刘昆，这名字在东北工人群众中，是非常熟悉的。自从“八一五”以后，他连挂过三次英雄勋章。一月二十号衡阳路局庆功大会他第四次被评为局的劳动英雄。
    老英雄是个技术很高的修机工，可是在过去，他的手艺从来也没拿出过。日寇统治东北的时候，有次他找到机会，在零下四十度的一天，把大轴灌上水，好好的机车便不能跑了。
    十多年来，他时时刻刻想办法对付敌人，马马虎虎干活，一共破坏了三部好机车。
    解放后共产党培养了这位英雄，他决心为人民服务，跟着胜利前进。去年秋天，他远征到了南方，被派到乐昌机务段当军事代表。别人问他：“你是一个修机工人，现在担负这样重的工作一定有困难。”
    他说：“困难！只要慢慢学，什么困难都可以克服。”在乐昌机务段工作时，一次煤只剩下五吨了，为了不停止跑车，他到处找，到处看，在原来的煤堆上，亲自动手，带动大家，一共清出了四十多吨。
    一九四六年他在东北，敌人丢下的破机车不能用，他带头克服了困难。齐齐哈尔局在这年冬天，完成了六十四吨货运、四十万吨粮运，和他的积极工作分不开。因此他被选为齐齐哈尔局的英雄。后来又遇到哈尔滨的机务工作发生了困难，冬天气候寒冷，机车休息五分钟便不能动。老英雄被调到那里当副段长。他不怕冷。他有一句话：“你不动弹你就冷。”到那里以后，工作很快的做起来。那里有刘昆，那里工作就展开。
    老英雄，气魄很大，度量宽宏，在工作上有时候被人家误会，他总是耐心的和别人解释。他是工人出身，处处懂得工人。就是个别工人有些落后，他苦口婆心，不放松教育。在新区，遇到少数落后工人发生偷盗行为，有些干部只求简单的开除完事，他说：“我们要耐心的说服教育。从前作工不够吃喝，工厂和工人是敌人，为什么不偷？只要懂得工厂是自己的，就不会再偷了。”从这里，说明他不仅是行动不离开群众，他的思想也牢牢的和群众结合在一起。因此，半年的工作，他得了第四个英雄勋章。
