　　Plain Province: Six Thousand Cadres Receive Cultural Education

　　Forty-One Agency-Run Spare-Time Schools Established

　　[This Dispatch] In the past two months or so, Plain Province has reorganized and established forty-one agency-run spare-time cultural refresher schools (hereinafter referred to as agency schools) in various regions, comprising one hundred and seventeen classes. A total of six thousand two hundred and ten male and female students are participating in the studies, accounting for approximately one-sixth of the province's cadres. Generally, each agency school has established a relatively standardized academic system, stipulating a one-year course for the elementary level, two years for the advanced level, and two years for history. Classes are generally held for two hours every morning. The teaching content includes the main courses of primary, senior primary, or secondary schools. Before students attend classes, they are generally divided into classes using a combination of self-reporting and testing. Some agency schools had previously adopted an inappropriate "one-size-fits-all" teaching method, which has now been corrected. Study systems and disciplines such as leave applications, examinations, and roll calls have also been generally established in each school.

　　Some difficulties were encountered when mobilizing and organizing cadres to enroll in schools. First, some cadres did not value cultural learning, believing that "it doesn't matter whether you learn culture or not." Some felt that they were veteran revolutionaries and were unwilling to learn from intellectuals who had recently joined the revolution, and even looked down on teachers. Still others lacked confidence in their studies, thinking, "We won't be able to get ahead in the future! Sooner or later, we'll have to go home, and there's no future for us." These thoughts have been largely overcome and corrected through repeated mobilization by leaders at all levels, explaining the importance of cultural learning in light of the current situation, and educating and encouraging everyone with Chairman Mao's learning attitude of "willing to be a primary school student," thus enhancing their enthusiasm for learning.

　　At the same time, each agency school has strengthened organizational leadership, established school affairs committees that include agency leaders, and hired full-time or part-time academic affairs directors and teachers. Some agency school students have also organized student unions or elected representatives to participate in school committees to assist the school in planning, leading, supervising, inspecting, and improving teaching. In order to improve learning effectiveness and correct the lax learning attitude of some students, many agency schools have adopted a method that combines top-down leadership emphasis with bottom-up learning initiative. In terms of leadership, the school and the agency administration cooperate with each other: the school regularly reports student performance to the agency, and the agency ensures that students complete their assignments on time and seriously conducts learning assessments and supervision; mutual aid groups are established among the students, learning codes are formulated, and mutual supervision and learning are carried out to encourage learning enthusiasm. For cadres who go to the countryside, many areas stipulate that they should study culture together with primary school teachers while in the countryside, and must submit a study report and notify the school for leave cancellation and make-up classes after returning to the agency, in order to ensure the balanced development of learning.

### 平原六千干部补习文化　　设立机关业余学校四十一处

　　平原六千干部补习文化
    设立机关业余学校四十一处
    【本报讯】在最近两个多月中，平原省各地已整顿和建立了机关干部业余文化补习学校（以下简称机关学校）四十一处，包括一百一十七班，参加学习的男女学员共六千二百一十名，约占全省干部的六分之一。各机关学校一般均建立了比较正规的学制，规定初级一年、高级二年、史学二年毕业。每日授课时间均为早上两小时。教学内容包括初、高小或中学的主要课程。学员上课之前，大多采取自报与测验相结合的方法分了班；一部分机关学校曾采取不适当的“一揽子”教学方式，现在，已获得纠正。各校的请假、考试、点名等学习制度和学习纪律，一般也建立起来了。
    在动员组织干部入学时曾遇到一些困难。首先是一部分干部不重视文化学习，认为“文化学不学没有啥”；有的觉得自己是老革命，不愿向新参加革命工作的知识分子学习，甚至瞧不起教员；还有一部分人则没有学习信心，认为“今后吃不开啦！早晚脱不了回家，没有前途了。”这些思想，经过各级领导干部的反复动员，根据当前形势说明文化学习的重要，并以毛主席“甘当小学生”的学习态度来教育大家，鼓励大家，大体上都已克服纠正，提高了学习热情。
    同时，各机关学校都加强了组织领导，建立了包括机关负责人参加的校务委员会，聘请了专任或兼任的教务主任和教员。有的机关学校的学员并组织了学生会或选代表参加学委会，协助校部计划、领导、督促、检查和改进教学。为了提高学习效果，并纠正一部分学员的学习松懈现象，许多机关学校采取了自上而下的领导重视和自下而上的学习自觉相结合的方法。在领导方面，学校校部与机关行政互相配合：学校定期向机关报告学员成绩，机关保证学员按时完成作业，并认真进行学习鉴定与督促检查；学员中则建立互助组，制订学习公约，互相监督，互相学习，以鼓舞学习情绪。对下乡干部，不少地区规定了下乡和小学教员一起学文化，回机关后必须作学习报告并转知学校销假和补课，以保证学习的平衡发展。
