　　Normal University Pilots "Youth League Lectures"
    Systematically Teaches Basic Knowledge of the League

    [Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, accepting the suggestion of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League, has begun piloting a new course, "Youth League Lectures," at National Beijing Normal University, with classes starting on the 11th. The purpose of establishing "Youth League Lectures" is to systematically teach the basic knowledge of the Youth League, so that students of Normal University can understand the work and operations of the League, making it easier to guide and assist the work of the League in middle schools in the future during their teaching work. The lectures are divided into six parts: explanation of the League's program and constitution; the principles and tasks of the youth movement in schools; the organizational work of the Youth League in schools; the propaganda and educational work of the Youth League in schools; work for children and a few questions about the Youth League in schools. Students who choose this course also intern at the Normal University's affiliated middle schools for boys and girls: participating in the organizational life of the League in the two schools, serving as propagandists, lecturing on League lessons, etc. The first lecture has already been given by Jiang Nanxiang, Deputy Secretary of the Central Committee of the Youth League.
