    In order to facilitate the development of industry in this city, to ensure the planned construction of factory buildings, and to protect the peace and safety of citizens' residences, the following is hereby decided:

    (1) In principle, general factories should be located in the East Suburb Industrial Zone.

    (2) If small factories are currently located in the suburbs and there are indeed difficulties due to capital and transportation, they may, upon approval, be temporarily located in the following two locations:

    (1) The area east of Ciqikou on Chongwai Avenue in the Outer Third District, north of Beigangzi Dongbanbijie on Fahuasi Street, west of the east city wall, and south of the north city wall.

    (2) The area west of Niujie on Daer Hutong Xiaxiejie in the Outer Fourth District, north of Zaolinqian Street, east of the west city wall, and south of the north city wall.

    (3) Except for the above-mentioned locations, no new factories with more than three horsepower are allowed to be established in other parts of the city.

    (4) Factories that produce explosives, offensive odors, or flammable materials must be located in the East Suburb Industrial Zone.

    (5) Existing factory buildings in the city are temporarily allowed to continue to be used. If expansion is planned in the future, it should be developed within the designated area.

    (6) Those who establish new factories or expand existing factories should first submit the factory site to the Industrial Construction Bureau of this government for approval; otherwise, they will be punished for illegal business operations or illegal construction, and may be ordered to suspend business or change the use of the building.

    It is hoped that all public and private industries will comply with this proclamation.
