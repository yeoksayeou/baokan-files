　　Shoe Industry Signs Labor-Management Collective Contract
    [News from the Beijing Municipal News Agency] The Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau officially approved the Beijing Shoe Industry Labor-Management Collective Contract on May 15th. There are approximately 400 shoe-making shops, workshops, and commercial firms in the Beijing shoe industry, employing more than 1,300 workers. Labor and management representatives were elected as early as last November to deliberate and draft the collective contract. After nine rounds of consultations, a preliminary agreement on the entire draft contract was reached on January 7th of this year. However, on January 18th, the management representative suddenly proposed that the piece-rate wages were set too high and that there should be no wages during work stoppages awaiting materials. This delayed the formal signing of the contract. This was due to concerns on the part of the management representative. After understanding the situation, the Labor Bureau, together with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, conducted persuasion and explanation separately. Subsequently, the management re-drafted the standards for various wages, and both parties went through three more rounds of consultations. The labor side agreed to lower the originally agreed-upon wage standards, and the entire draft contract was finally passed on March 16th.
    The characteristic of the contract is that it specifically stipulates the piece-rate wage system and the "standard amount" and "minimum amount" of wages. For example, the standard wage for each pair of men's leather shoes is 7 jin and 10 liang of millet, and the minimum is 3 jin and 12 liang; the standard wage for each pair of leather shoe uppers is 2 jin and 4 liang, and the minimum is 1 jin and 8 liang. On the one hand, it takes into account the current temporary difficulties of the management's business and the specific circumstances of different sizes of factories, and on the other hand, it also takes into account the workers' minimum living standards and encourages their enthusiasm for production. This makes it easier to implement the collective contract throughout the entire industry.

### 鞋业签订劳资集体合同

　　鞋业签订劳资集体合同
    【京市新闻处讯】京市劳动局五月十五日正式批准北京市鞋业劳资集体合同。京市鞋业共有绱鞋、作坊，及商号等约四百余家，职工一千三百多人。去年十一月劳资双方就选出了代表，进行酝酿起草集体合同，先后经过九次协商，直到今年一月七日全部合同草案才获得初步协议，但在一月十八日资方代表突又提出计件工资订得太高，停工待料期间不应有工资等问题，合同的正式签订因而拖延，这是由于资方代表思想上仍有顾虑，劳动局在了解了这些情况后，就会同市总工会分别进行说服解释。后由资方重新拟出各项工资的标准，双方又经过三次协商。劳方同意降低原协议的工资标准，全部合同草案，始于三月十六日最后获得通过。
    合同的特点是具体地规定了计件工资制和工资的“标准数”与“最低数”。例如：每双男皮的皮鞋的工资标准数为小米七斤十两，最低数为三斤十二两；皮鞋帮每双工资标准数为二斤四两，最低数为一斤八两。一方面照顾了资方目前营业的暂时困难及大小厂号不同的具体情况，另一方面也照顾了工人的最低生活，鼓舞了工人的生产积极性。这样便使集体合同易于在整个行业中贯彻执行。
