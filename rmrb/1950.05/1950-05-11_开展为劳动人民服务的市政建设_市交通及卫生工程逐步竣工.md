　　Developing Municipal Construction to Serve the Working People: City Traffic and Sanitation Projects Progressively Completed

    [Our Newspaper] Reporter Feng Zhong and Mu Yang report: Beijing's municipal construction work for 1950 is actively underway, adhering to the policy of serving production and serving the working people. A portion of the projects have already been completed.

            Road Construction

    This year's municipal construction in Beijing focuses on traffic and sanitation projects. Traffic projects mainly involve the construction and maintenance of roads. Among Beijing's more than three thousand streets and alleys, less than one-tenth have paved surfaces. During the reactionary government's rule, road construction was only for the convenience of a small number of the ruling class. Places like Rear Round Temple, where Chiang Kai-shek lived, and East Factory Alley, where Hu Shih lived, had concrete-paved roads, while the areas where the vast majority of people lived had very few good roads. In order to change this situation, the People's Government plans to construct ten trunk roads with a total area of 216,272 square meters this year, based on the principles of connecting industrial centers, opening up important lines, facilitating public transportation, and meeting the needs of the majority of citizens. The East and West Biao Bei Alley and North Gou Yan projects were completed in late March, completing 28,831 square meters of gravel road surface. Except for the former Ministry of Justice Street and East Suburb Road, other roads are also under construction or the roadbed is being prepared. Among them, two asphalt roads, Andingmen Street (10,183 square meters) and the Ministry of Justice Street (3,901 square meters), will be fully completed in mid-May. 18,713 square meters of road surface from Beixinqiao to Gulou has also completed 36.5 percent. East and West Biao Bei Alley is a major road to the eastern suburbs. The original stone road was bumpy and uneven, and even more muddy after rain, so pedestrians mostly detoured. Now, after being repaired into a flat gravel road, the number of pedestrians and vehicles has immediately increased several times. Andingmen Street is a major road to northern Beijing, connecting the Beijing-Chengde Highway outside the city. The working people are concentrated in this area. In the past, only when the reactionary government's "officials" sacrificed to Confucius (the Imperial College is on this street) twice a year would they temporarily pad the pits with yellow soil. Now, a wide asphalt road has been built. Everyone passing by is talking about: "Andingmen has asphalt roads too!"

    The existing asphalt roads, cement roads, and gravel roads have also been damaged in some places due to disrepair over the years. The Municipal Construction Bureau has begun to repair old roads while building new roads. The line from Yongdingmen to Nanyuan, inside Di'anmen, and from Xizhimen to Xinjiekou are all under construction. In addition, there are plans to improve the dirt roads of seventeen important alleys, building them into cobblestone and cinder surfaces, so that they connect with the trunk roads and facilitate transportation in densely populated areas. After the main lines in the city are completed, the construction will begin.

            Dredging Sewers

    In terms of sanitation projects, the main goal is to improve the capital's environmental sanitation and solve the problem of sewage discharge in areas where the working people live. This year, the plan is to dredge and repair existing sewers, convert the Dragon Beard Ditch into a covered drain, and try to solve the problem of water accumulation in the east, west, and north city walls, Paozi River, Tianqiao, and other places, dredge rivers, dredge the Three Seas and Shichahai to increase water sources, etc. Most of the old sewers in Beijing are silted up and collapsed. This year, the plan is to first dredge and repair the six main systems of the north and south Gou Yan, Chongwenmen, Chaoyangmen, Andingmen, North Xinhua Street, Qipan Street, and Da Shi Qiao, with a total length of more than 101,000 meters of channels. The above projects started comprehensively on January 13th. As of April 11th, the entire dredging work has been basically completed. A total of 39,524.29 cubic meters of sludge were dredged, with a total of 59,753 workdays used. As of the end of April, the construction project has repaired 1,724 meters of channel body, built 291 inspection wells, and added 86 rain inlets. The dredging project of the Da Shi Qiao open ditch started on April 4th and has now been fully completed. The Dragon Beard Ditch reconstruction project is larger, with many blockages, an unsuitable slope, and a large amount of foul soil, sewage, feces, and rotten debris, with a foul odor, especially in summer, which is the source of gastrointestinal infectious diseases over the years. The nearby area is inhabited by working people such as workers, independent laborers, and vendors. There are more than 40,000 residents along the ditch within the old 12th district alone. The surveying, geological exploration, and design work have now been completed, and a large amount of materials and tools such as cement, river sand, gravel, and wood have been prepared, striving to start construction in mid-May. When the Sanitation Engineering Bureau was conducting the survey, the residents along the ditch were very happy and asked the surveyors questions, revealing their infinite gratitude to the People's Government.

            Dredging Rivers and Lakes

    Dredging the city's rivers and lakes is one of the important keys to improving the capital's environmental sanitation. Beijing's river and lake system originates from Yuquan Mountain. Due to disrepair over the years, most of them have been silted up, the water volume is insufficient, mosquitoes breed, and they are dirty and unbearable. This year, the Sanitation Engineering Bureau plans to dredge the Jinhe River, Changhe River, Tongzi River, Yudai River, and the moats, with a total length of 62,000 meters, and dredge the Beihai, Zhongnanhai, Shichahai, Houhai, and Jishuitan, so as to form a complete river and lake system, introducing clear water from Yuquan Mountain to smoothly pass through these rivers and lakes and run through the city. Ten mechanical wells will be drilled upstream to supplement the insufficient water volume of Yuquan Mountain. The dredging projects of the Jinhe River, Changhe River, Northwest Moat, West Moat, Qian San Men Moat, and the upper reaches of the Tonghui River were completed in early April, with a total of 323,975 cubic meters of earth excavated. The South Moat started dredging on April 12th, the Northeast Moat on May 3rd, and the Tongzi River has also started draining water. Nine well-drilling projects have been completed successively. After a month of preparation, the dredging of the Three Seas started in Beihai on April 6th, followed by Zhonghai and Nanhai on April 8th and 10th, respectively. After a month of intense work, the Zhonghai project has been basically completed, Beihai has completed two-thirds, and Nanhai has completed three-quarters. The dredging of Shichahai and Jishuitan is being prepared for measurement. As of the end of April, the total number of man-days used for dredging rivers and the Three Seas was 388,913, and the amount of earth excavated was 525,699.6 cubic meters.

    Since the comprehensive launch of the capital's municipal construction work, it has been supported by the broad masses of the people. Dredging sewers, dredging the Three Seas, and dredging the moats have never happened in decades. Especially the working people living in the Dragon Beard Ditch area have suffered from the dirt of the Dragon Beard Ditch for many years, but during the reactionary government's rule, they did not dare to think that anyone would take care of their health. The unanimous comment of the people of the city is: the current government is truly the people's government!

　　开展为劳动人民服务的市政建设
　  市交通及卫生工程逐步竣工
    【本报讯】记者冯仲、穆扬报道：北京市一九五○年度市政建设工作，正在遵循着为生产服务、为劳动人民服务的方针，积极进行中。其中一部工程业已竣工。
            修筑道路
    京市本年度市政建设，以交通与卫生工程为主。交通工程主要为修筑及保养道路。京市三千多条街道胡同中，已铺装路面的不及十分之一。在反动政府统治时期，修路只是为了少数统治阶级的方便，像蒋匪住过的后圆恩寺，胡适住过的东厂胡同，都修了水泥灌浆路；而广大人民聚居的地方却很少好路。人民政府为了改变这一情况，今年计划在连结产业中心、打通重要干线、便利公共交通、适应多数市民需要的原则下，修筑十条总面积达二十一万六千二百七十二平方公尺的干路，东西裱褙胡同及北沟沿两处工程已于三月下旬完工，计完成石碴路面二八、八三一平方公尺。除旧刑部街及东郊两条路外，其他各路也正在修筑或整理路床。其中安定门大街一○、一八三平方公尺、司法部街三、九○一平方公尺的两条沥青路，本月中旬即可全部竣工。北新桥至鼓楼的一八、七一三平方公尺路面，也已完成了百分之三十六点五。东西裱褙胡同为通东郊要路，原有石路坎坷不平，遇雨更泥泞不堪，行人多绕道而行，现修成平坦的石碴路后，行人车辆立即增多数倍。安定门大街为通京北要道，城外衔接京承（德）公路，劳动人民密集此地。过去只是在一年两度反动政府的“官员”祭孔（国子监在这条街）时，才用黄土临时垫一垫坑。现则修筑了宽阔的沥青马路。通往行人都互相谈论着：“安定门也修柏油马路了。”
    过去已有的沥青路、洋灰路、石碴路因年久失修，也有若干地方破坏，市建设局于修筑新路的同时，开始修补旧路。永定门至南苑线，地安门内及西直门至新街口等处，都正在动工。此外并计划改善十七条重要胡同的土路，修筑成卵石路及煤渣路面，使与干路衔接，便利市民密集地区的交通。俟城内各干线竣工后，即着手修筑。
            掏挖下水道
    在卫生工程方面，主要是改善首都的环境卫生，解决劳动人民聚居地区的排除污水问题。今年计划掏挖、修建已有的下水道，改建龙须沟为暗沟，尽量解决东、西、北城根、泡子河、天桥等地积水问题，疏浚河道，疏浚三海、什刹海，增加水源等。北京旧有的下水道大部淤塞坍塌，今年将先掏挖、修建南北沟沿、崇文门、朝阳门、安定门、北新华街、棋盘街、大石桥等六个主要系统总长十万一千余公尺的沟道。上述工程自一月十三日起全面开工，迄四月十一日止，全部掏挖工作已基本完成。共掏挖淤泥三九、五二四·二九公方，总计用工五九、七五三个。修建工程迄四月底止，已整修沟身一、七二四公尺，修建探井二九一座，添修雨水口八六座。疏浚大石桥明沟工程，于四月四日开工，现已全部竣工。龙须沟改建暗沟工程较大，满身多处堵塞，坡度又不适宜，秽土、秽水、粪便及腐朽杂物极多，臭气难闻，夏季尤甚，为历年肠胃传染病的发源地。附近多工人、独立劳动者、商贩等劳动人民聚居，仅旧十二区界内沿沟居民即达四万余人。现测量、地质试探及设计工作业已完成，并备齐大量洋灰、河沙、石子、木料等材料及工具，争取五月中旬开工。在卫生工程局进行测量时，沿沟居民都非常高兴，向测量人员问长问短，言表中流露出对人民政府的无限感激。
            疏浚河湖
    疏浚全市河道及湖泊工作为改善首都环境卫生的重要关键之一。京市河湖水系发源于玉泉山，因年久失修，多已淤塞，水量不足，蚊虫繁殖，肮脏不堪。卫生工程局今年计划疏浚全长六万二千公尺的金河、长河、筒子河、玉带河及各护城河，并掏挖北海、中南海、什刹海、后海及积水潭，使成为一完善之河湖系统，引玉泉山清水，顺畅地经过这些河湖，贯穿市内。并在上游凿机井十眼，以补玉泉山水量之不足。金河、长河、西北护城河、西护城河、前三门护城河及通惠河上游的疏浚工程，已先后在四月上旬竣工，共计挖土三二三、九七五公方。南护城河已于四月十二日、东北护城河已于五月三日起分别开工疏浚，筒子河也已动工排水。凿井工程已陆续完成九眼。掏挖三海工程，经一个月准备工作后，四月六日起首先在北海开工，中海、南海也分别于八日、十日开工。经一个月的紧张工作，中海工程已基本完工，北海完成了三分之二，南海完成了四分之三。掏挖什刹海及积水潭工程正准备测量。迄四月底止，全部疏浚河道及三海共计已用人工三十八万八千九百十三个，掏挖土方五十二万五千六百九十九点六公方。
    首都市政建设工作全面展开以后，得到广大人民的拥护。掏挖下水道、掏挖三海、疏浚护城河道，这是几十年来从未有过的事。尤其是在龙须沟一带居住的劳动人民，虽连年受龙须沟肮脏之害，但在反动政府统治时期，想也不敢想会有人照顾他们的健康。全市人民的一致评语是：现在的政府真正是人民的政府了！
