　　Huailai Garrison Cooperates with Government and Masses
　　Preparing to Repair the Yang River Embankment
    [Our Newspaper, Huailai] A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Huailai, Chahar Province, is cooperating with the local government and the masses of Dahuangzhuang Village to prepare for the repair of the northern bank of the Yang River embankment. Last autumn, the floodwaters overflowed, and the river shifted northward, washing away more than 400 mu of river land in Dahuangzhuang Village. In September, the masses of the village organized a river management committee, and with the help of the People's Government and the garrison, built an embankment eight li long, capable of protecting 3,000 mu of land and siltating 2,000 mu; however, when the river opened this spring, the river water scoured it, and it has now been completely destroyed. On April 14, the Chahar Provincial Commissioner's Office and the local garrison convened a water conservancy conference for Huai (lai) and Zhuo (lu) counties and their subordinate Dahuangzhuang and Shuangshu villages, and drafted a preliminary plan for flood control and siltation. On the 5th of this month, a second meeting was held, and after detailed study and discussion, a specific construction plan was formulated, and all preparations are now underway. Construction is scheduled to begin on the 21st of this month and be completed by June 9th.

　　怀来驻军协同政府群众
　　准备兴修洋河护堤
    【本报怀来讯】驻察南怀来的解放军某部，正协同当地政府及大黄庄村群众，准备兴修洋河北岸护堤。去年秋天，洪水泛滥，河身北移，大黄庄村被冲毁河地四百余亩。九月间，该村群众曾组织治河委员会，在人民政府及驻军帮助下，筑成长达八里的堤坝，能护地三千亩，淤地二千亩；但今春河开时，河水冲刷，目前已全部毁坏。四月十四日，察南专署该地驻军召开了怀（来）、涿（鹿）二县及所属之大黄庄，双树村水利会议，拟定防洪淤滩施工的初步计划。本月五日，又开了第二次会议，经过详细研究、讨论，定出具体施工方案，现正着手进行一切准备工作。预定本月二十一日开工，至六月九日完成。
