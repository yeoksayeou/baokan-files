Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th: On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of Germany's liberation, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union exchanged congratulatory letters. In its letter of congratulations to the Central Committee of the CPSU, headed by Stalin, the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany emphasized that the great victory of the Soviet army opened a new chapter in the history of the German people. The letter pointed out that, thanks to the great assistance of the Soviet Union, fascism has been eradicated in the German territories liberated by the Soviet army. The democratic forces of Germany established the German Democratic Republic on October 7, 1949, and have obtained diplomatic recognition from the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. This has opened the way for the German people to enter the family of peace-loving nations. The letter finally assured that it would carry out an unremitting struggle to unite all peace-loving Germans into the National Front of Democratic Germany, in order to prevent the conspiracy of American and British imperialism to turn German territory into a springboard for another anti-Soviet war.

In its reply to the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the Central Committee of the CPSU congratulated the Socialist Unity Party – the vanguard of the German people – on its new achievements in the struggle for the vital interests of the German working class and all working people, for the establishment of a unified, democratic, and peace-loving German state, and for the cause of peace.

　　德统一社会党与联共互函致贺
    【新华社十一日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：德国统一社会党中央委员会与苏联共产党中央委员会在德国解放五周年纪念日之际，曾互致贺函。德统一社会党中央在致以斯大林为首的联共中央贺函中，强调苏军的伟大胜利，揭开了德国人民历史中新的一章。贺函指出，由于苏联的伟大援助，法西斯主义在苏军解放了的德国领土上已被肃清。德国民主势力已于一九四九年十月七日建立了德意志民主共和国，并已获得了苏联及人民民主国家在外交上的承认。这就打开了德国人民进入爱好和平各国人民大家庭的途径。贺函最后保证将进行不疲倦的斗争，把所有爱好和平的德国人团结到民主德意志全国阵线中来，以阻止美英帝国主义想变德国领土为另一次反苏战争跳板的阴谋。
    联共中央在致德国统一社会党中央的复函中，祝贺统一社会党——德国人民的先锋队，在为德国工人阶级以及一切劳动人民的切身利益，为成立统一、民主与爱好和平的德意志国家，为和平事业而进行的斗争中，获得新的成就。
