Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd: According to TASS, the magazine "New Times" and the newspaper "Labor" have specially written editorials to welcome the opening of the World Federation of Trade Unions Executive Committee meeting.

　　The "New Times" magazine editorial, in pointing out the unprecedented organizational strength of the World Federation of Trade Unions, stated: In less than a year, twelve trade union internationals have been established, proving that the work of the World Federation of Trade Unions has taken a major step forward; moreover, because many industrial unions in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa have joined these internationals, they have condemned the divisive tactics of the national trade union central organizations in these countries in breaking away from the World Federation of Trade Unions.

　　"New Times" pointed out: One of the main events of concern to the World Federation of Trade Unions is the struggle for peace. By actively promoting the development of the peace movement, the World Federation of Trade Unions is fulfilling one of its most important responsibilities to the working class around the world.

　　The magazine exposed the conspiracy of the United States imperialism-led group to prepare for a new war, accused the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions" organized by international labor traitors at the end of last year as being the center of the imperialists' plan to ideologically prepare for another war of aggression, and emphasized that under such circumstances, the unity of trade unions and the interdependence of international labor are of unprecedented importance.

　　The "Labor" newspaper editorial emphasized: This meeting of the WFTU Executive Committee will formulate concrete and necessary measures to realize the economic and social demands of the working class. The editorial stated: When all capitalist countries are shrouded in a growing economic crisis, and when the army of unemployed workers in these countries has exceeded forty-five million and continues to increase, the struggle to improve the living standards of the working people is of particular significance.

　　The newspaper, after emphasizing that the strength of the working class lies in unity, pointed out: There is no doubt that this meeting of the WFTU Executive Committee will help to unite the masses of trade union members more closely under the banner of proletarian internationalism, to fight for the protection of the vital rights of the working people mentioned above, against war and unemployment, and for lasting peace.

　　紧密团结在无产阶级国际主义旗帜下
    世界工联空前强大
    苏报撰文迎接工联执委会议
    【新华社二十二日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：《新时代》杂志和《劳动报》特撰社论，以迎接世界工会联合会执行委员会会议的揭幕。
    《新时代》杂志的社论于指出世界工联组织方面的空前强大时说：不到一年，已有十二个工会国际建立起来，这证明世界工联的工作已向前迈进了一大步；而且，由于美、加、澳、纽西兰、南非等许多产业工会都参加了这些国际，因而谴责了各该国全国性工会中央机构脱离世界工联的分裂技俩。
    《新时代》指出：世界工联所关心的主要事件之一，就是为和平而斗争。积极推进和平运动的发展，这样，世界工联就对全世界的工人阶级尽着它最重大的责任之一。
    该杂志揭露以美帝国主义为首的准备新战争的阴谋，指责国际工贼在去年年底所组织的“自由工会联合会”，是帝国主义者在思想上准备另一次侵略战争的计划的中心，并强调地说明在这样的情况之下，工会的团结和国际劳工的休戚相关有着空前的重要性。
    《劳动报》的社论着重指出：世界工联执委会的这次会议，将拟定具体的必要措施，以实现工人阶级的经济要求和社会要求。社论说：当一切资本主义国家都被日益增长的经济危机所笼罩的时候，当这些国家失业工人的大军已超过四千五百万还继续有加无已的时候，为提高劳动人民的生活标准的斗争，就有着特别重大的意义。
    该报在强调工人阶级的力量在于团结之后指出：不容怀疑，世界工联执委会的这次会议，必将有助于把工会会员群众更加亲密地团结在无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下，为保护劳动人民上述切身权利，为反对战争和失业，为争取持久和平而斗争。
