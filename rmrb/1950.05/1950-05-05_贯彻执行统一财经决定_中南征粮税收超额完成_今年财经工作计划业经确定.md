Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 29th—Over the past two months, the Central South Region has resolutely implemented the Central People's Government's Government Administration Council's decision on unifying national financial and economic work, achieving significant results. As of now, the recovery of arrears from the 1949 autumn public grain in the entire region, except for Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, which only completed 60% due to weaker work foundations and sabotage by bandits and secret agents, has been fully completed in all other provinces and has been mostly stored in warehouses. The actual revenue from regular taxes in the first quarter of the entire region exceeded the central government's assigned task by 18%. The entire region has completed 80% of the first phase of the Victory Public Bonds, with Henan and Jiangxi provinces even exceeding the target. Other tasks, such as inventorying warehouses, reorganizing establishments, and establishing treasury at all levels, are also being carried out separately. The financial and economic situation is beginning to improve, and financial prices are gradually stabilizing. As of April 14th, prices across the region had generally fallen by 24% compared to early March, a new situation unseen in the past twelve years.

The Financial and Economic Committee of the Central South Military and Political Committee held its first meeting from March 19th to 21st, summarizing the above achievements and determining the Central South Region's 1950 financial and economic work plan as follows: (1) Resolutely complete the tasks of public grain, tax revenue, and public bonds, conscientiously compile and verify the number of personnel, strictly inventory warehouse materials, complete the establishment of treasury, recall currency and transfer grain, and thoroughly correct corruption and waste phenomena to ensure the implementation of the Government Administration Council's decision on unifying national financial and economic work. (2) In terms of restoring the people's economy: focus on the Yangtze River, Han River, and Dongting Lake to repair embankments and prevent floods. In terms of agricultural production, the semi-old liberated areas should focus on restoration, requiring a 10% increase on the original level; the newly liberated areas should maintain the original level, and strive for a slight increase where possible; the severely affected areas should strive to restore pre-disaster yields, and the lightly affected areas should strive for appropriate improvements in addition to restoring production. The entire region should increase grain production by 1.65 billion jin in 1950 based on normal production levels, plant 10.27 million mu of cotton, and produce 3.469 million dan of ginned cotton. Industrial restoration will be carried out according to the central government's unified decision plan. (3) In terms of factory and enterprise reform: emphasize the establishment and improvement of security organization systems to ensure the safety of factories and workers. (4) Universally establish cooperatives in areas where land reform has been implemented, and selectively establish them in areas where land reform has not been implemented, and establish cooperative leadership organizations from top to bottom.

    今年财经工作计划业经确定
    【新华社汉口二十九日电】中南区两个月来坚决贯彻执行了中央人民政府政务院统一国家财政经济工作的决定，已获得显著成绩。截至目前止，全区一九四九年秋季公粮尾欠追缴，除广东、广西两省因工作基础较弱及土匪特务破坏等原因仅完成百分之六十外，其余各省均已扫数完成，并已大部入仓。全区第一季经常税收的实收额，超过中央所分配任务的百分之十八。第一期胜利公债全区已完成百分之八十，河南、江西两省且超额完成任务。其余如清理仓库，整顿编制与建立各级金库等工作亦正分头进行中。目前财政经济情况开始好转，金融物价逐渐趋于稳定，至四月十四日止，全区物价较三月初普遍下降百分之二十四，出现了十二年来所未曾有过的新情势。
    中南军政委员会财政经济委员会于三月十九日至二十一日召开首届会议，总结了上述成绩，并确定了中南区一九五○年的财政经济工作计划为：（一）坚决完成公粮、税收、公债任务，切实编制核实人数，严格清理仓库物资，完成建立金库、回笼货币与调运粮食，彻底纠正贪污浪费现象，以保证政务院统一国家财经工作决定的贯彻执行。（二）在恢复人民经济方面：以长江、汉水、洞庭湖为重点，修堤防洪。农业生产方面，在半老区以恢复为主，要求在原有水平提高一成；新区保持原有水平，可能条件下争取略加提高；重灾区争取恢复灾前产量，轻灾区除恢复生产外，争取适当提高。全区一九五○年按常年生产水平增产粮食十六亿五千万斤，植棉一千零二十七万亩，产皮棉三百四十六万九千担。工业恢复按中央统一决定的计划进行。（三）在工厂企业改革方面：强调建立与健全保安组织制度，以确保工厂与工人的安全。（四）在已实行土地改革地区普遍建立合作社，在未土地改革地区有重点地建立，并自上而下建立合作社的领导机构。
