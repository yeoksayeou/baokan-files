　　Government Bond Annual Interest Calculated Based on Twelve Months
To: People's Cultural Center of Wu'an County, Hebei:
　　Regarding the issue of interest calculation on government bonds, the Head Office of the People's Bank of China has replied as follows:
　　Interest is generally calculated based on the annual interest rate. The statement that the annual interest rate is calculated based on ten months is incorrect. The difference between the annual interest rate and the monthly interest rate is that the monthly interest rate is one-twelfth of the annual interest rate. Calculating the annual interest rate does not mean deducting two months of interest. For example, if the annual interest rate is 5%, when converted to a monthly interest rate, the monthly interest rate is one-twelfth of the annual interest rate, not one-tenth; and vice versa. Government bond interest is calculated annually, with one month being one-twelfth of a year. If interest is paid for one month, it is naturally calculated as one-twelfth of the full year's interest.

### 公债年利计算是按十二个月

　　公债年利计算是按十二个月河北武安县人民文化馆：
    公债计息问题已经中国人民银行总行答复如下：
    计算利息一般是以年利为标准的，年利率以十个月计算的说法，并不正确。年利率与月利率的分别是：月利率为年利率的十二分之一，计算年利并不少算二个月的利息。例如年利五厘，化作月利率时，月利率为年利率的十二分之一，而不是十分之一；反之亦然。公债利息，是按年计算的，一个月为一年的十二分之一，如贴息一个月，自然是以全年利息的十二分之一来计算了。
