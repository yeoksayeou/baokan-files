　　Remedying Uneven Cotton Seedling Emergence After Sowing
　　Tangshan Prefecture Calls for Replanting
    [Our Tangshan Dispatch] Cotton sowing in Tangshan Prefecture, Hebei Province, is nearing completion. Some counties have found that the emergence of seedlings after sowing cotton seeds marked with the character "斯" (S) is not good. The Prefectural Commissioner's Office has instructed all counties to replant in a timely manner. In Peijiabao and Zhangguanying and other six villages in the ninth district of Changli County in the area, the emergence rate is at most one-half, and in some cases, one-third. In the sixth district, there are also many cases of no emergence. The masses are expressing many opinions about the loaned cotton seeds. For this reason, the Tangshan Prefectural Commissioner's Office urgently instructed all counties to promptly check the seedling emergence situation in the cotton fields and to quickly replant when missing seedlings are found. It also put forward the following remedial measures: (1) It is necessary to explain clearly to the masses that there is no major problem with the germination rate of the "S" cotton seeds. The main reason is that the seeds were sown too deep, the climate was somewhat cold, and sowing was earlier, resulting in incomplete emergence or no emergence at all. However, the harvest of "S" cotton seeds is still large. (2) Timely inspection is necessary, and one seedling should be replanted for each missing seedling. Before replanting, the cotton seeds should be selected, soaked in boiling water, and sown together with the soaked beans, which can help the cotton seedlings emerge from the soil. The soil covering should be shallow, generally only one finger deep. (3) In cotton fields where no seedlings have emerged and the seeds have rotted in the soil, replanting of cotton should be expedited.

　　补救棉花播种后出苗不齐
　　唐山专署号召补种
    【本报唐山讯】河北唐山专区棉花播种已近结束，有些县份发现斯字棉籽下种后出苗不好，专署指示各县及时补种。该区昌黎县九区裴家堡、张官营等六个村，出苗最多者二分之一，少者三分之一；六区也有很多没出苗。群众对贷的棉籽议论纷纷。为此，唐山专署紧急指示各县抓紧检查棉田出苗情况，发现缺苗时即迅速补上，并提出如下补救办法：（一）必须向群众解释明白斯字棉种发芽率并无大问题，主要因为种的过深，气候有些冷，播种较早，因而出苗不全或全部未出。但斯字棉种收成还是大的。（二）要及时检查，发现缺一棵补一棵。在补种之先应拣选一下棉种，以开水浸种，并与浸过的豆子一齐下种，可以帮助棉芽出土。培土要浅，一般在一指深即可。（三）没出来苗的棉地，种籽已在土内腐烂，应抓紧翻种棉花。
