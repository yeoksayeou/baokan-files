　　Fifth District Workers' Hospital Officially Opens
　  Over a Thousand Patients Treated During Preparation Period
    [Our Newspaper] The Fifth District Workers' Hospital, thanks to the active assistance of the Military Commission's Health Department, the Municipal Health Bureau, and people from all walks of life in the Fifth District, has rapidly completed its preparations and officially opened on the 11th. The hospital began preparations in October of last year. By January of this year, in order to meet the needs of workers, it began offering consultations under the name of the Preparatory Office. In four months, due to the efforts of the medical staff, initial achievements have been made. Laboring people from various districts in the city and suburbs, including Shijingshan and Mentougou, which are relatively far away, have come for treatment. As of the end of April, a total of 1,329 initial consultations had been conducted.
    At the hospital's opening ceremony, worker representative Comrade Wang Tingshan excitedly said: "Who looked up to workers in the past? Only today, under the leadership of the Communist Party, thanks to the efforts of the medical staff and the support of people from all walks of life, has a workers' hospital been established. In the future, we must work even more actively to improve production and our skills." Chen Zhigang, a worker from the privately-owned Baofeng Factory, said: "A worker in our factory developed facial edema. When he asked at other hospitals, they quoted him 500,000 yuan, which scared him away. After being introduced to the Workers' Hospital, he was cured for only 10,000 yuan. The doctor even came to the factory to see the patient in person. The Workers' Hospital truly serves the workers!"

　　五区工人医院正式开幕
　  筹备期间就医者已达千余人
    【本报讯】第五区工人医院由于军委卫生部、市卫生局及五区各界人民的积极帮助，已使筹备工作迅速就绪，乃于十一日正式开幕。该院自去年十月间即开始筹建，至今年一月间，为适合工人需要，曾以筹备处为名先行开诊。在四个月里，由于医务工作者的努力，已获得初步成绩，城郊各区，包括路程较远的石景山、门头沟等地劳动人民纷纷前来就诊。至四月底止，共计初诊一、三二九人。
    该院开幕典礼时，工人代表王廷善同志兴奋地说：“以前谁瞧得起工人，只有今天在共产党的领导下，由于医务工作者的努力，与各界人民的赞助才建立了工人医院，今后一定更积极的搞好生产，搞好业务。”私营宝丰工厂工人陈至刚说：“我们厂子里有个工人得了面部浮肿的病，到别的医院里一问，要五十万元，把他吓回来了，经介绍到工人医院，一万块钱就治好人了，大夫还亲自到厂子里来看病人。工人医院真正是为工人服务！”
