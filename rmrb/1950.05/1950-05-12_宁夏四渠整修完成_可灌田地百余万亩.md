Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 10th: The refurbishment project of the Tanglai, Hanyan, Huinong, and Daqing canals on the west bank of the Yellow River in Ningxia Province, lasting half a month, was completed at the end of April. Water has been released successively, enabling the irrigation of over 1.25 million mu of land. During the rule of the bandit Ma Hongkui, the Tanglai, Hanyan, Huinong, and Daqing canals lacked controlled sluice gates, making it impossible to regulate the water volume. The water diversion channels had many bends, and the gate structures were not sturdy, making them prone to damage and frequent accidents. After the liberation of Ningxia Province last year, the Ningxia Provincial People's Government Water Conservancy Bureau decided to re-refurbish the aforementioned four canals, planning to repair the old dams, reduce the length of the gates, and strengthen the embankments. After several months of thorough preparation, the refurbishment project of the four canals commenced in mid-April.

During the project, the Ningxia Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau specially established the Hexi Spring Repair Project Committee to uniformly organize and lead the refurbishment work. Simultaneously, a democratic management system was established, abolishing the past foreman system and implementing a contract system and a democratic work point calculation and verification system. Political education and recreational activities for the laborers were strengthened to inspire their conscious labor enthusiasm. These measures greatly improved the work efficiency of the laborers, and the refurbishment project was completed by the end of April. According to experienced old boatmen such as Liu Faxing, the water volume of the Daqing Canal this year exceeds any year during Ma Hongkui's rule, and the water level is still continuing to rise, ensuring ample irrigation for farmland this year.

### 宁夏四渠整修完成　可灌田地百余万亩

　　宁夏四渠整修完成
　　可灌田地百余万亩
    【新华社西安十日电】宁夏省黄河西岸的唐徕、汉延、惠农、大清等四渠整修工程，历时半月，已于四月底完成，并已先后放水，可使一百二十五万余亩土地得到灌溉。唐徕、汉延、惠农、大清等四渠在马匪鸿逵统治时期，各渠口都没有管制闸，不能控制水量；各引水槽湾曲很多、跳闸的构造又不坚固。极易冲坏，时常发生险工。去年宁夏全省解放后，宁夏省人民政府水利局即决定重新整修上述四渠，计划修补旧水坝，减少跳闸长度，巩固堤岸。经过数月的充分准备，整修四渠工程即于四月中旬开工。
    在工程进行中，宁夏省水利局特成立河西春修工程委员会，以统一组织领导整修工作；同时又建立民主管理制度，废除过去的监工制，实行包工制、民主计工核算制，并加强对民工的政治教育、开展文娱活动等，以启发民工自觉的劳动热忱。这些办法使民工工作效率大为提高，整修工程到四月底即告完成。据有经验的老水手刘发兴等谈：今年大清渠水量超过马匪鸿逵统治时期任何一年，且水位仍在继续增长中，今年农田灌溉已有充分的保障。
