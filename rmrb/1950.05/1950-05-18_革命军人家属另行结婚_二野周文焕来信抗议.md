　　Revolutionary Soldier's Family Member Remarries
　　Second Field Army's Zhou Wenhuan Writes to Protest

To the Editor:
    My name is Zhou Wenhuan, and I am from Banpo Village, Yushe County, Shanxi Province. In 1944, I participated in a training class at the Taihang Second Prefectural Committee Cadre Middle School for three months. After graduation, I was assigned to work in the Secretariat of the Taigu County Government. In January 1946, I was admitted to the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Military and Political University through an organizational referral. After graduating in March 1947, I was assigned to work in the Supply Department of the Sixth Brigade of the Third Column of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Field Army at the time. I went south in July and am now working in the Supply Department of the Twelfth Army of the Second Field Army.

    After I went south, I faced life and death situations, completing the tasks assigned to me by the Party. My relationship with my wife has always been very good, and she had already been admitted to a school through an organizational referral, which made me even more relieved. Who would have thought that in a school directly led by our Party, my wife, who was inexperienced and had never been out in society before, would be taken away by a cadre from the Handan Municipal Government who held a significant position, using rumors and deception. Moreover, after the fact, my brother repeatedly wrote letters on my behalf to the Municipal Government and the Municipal Middle School, but they ignored them. Only once did they write a few vague words on scrap paper to deny it.

    When I was about to be assigned a job after graduating from the Military University, my beloved, Li Xianmei, came to my school to find me. After I was assigned to the Third Column, the organization referred her to the Rear Family School of the Sixth Brigade (then residing in Wu'an), and later the Family School recommended her to Wu'an Elementary School, and then in the winter of 1947, she was recommended to study at Handan Municipal Middle School. After I went south, I wrote home and to my brother at the Military University every three or four months, and I also wrote to Li Xianmei. Last May or June, I suddenly received a letter from the principal of the Family School, saying that my beloved, Li Xianmei, had married another cadre at Handan Middle School. Soon after, my brother wrote from the Military University, saying that Li Xianmei had gone to my brother's place at the Military University (Qilidian Village, Yongnian) in the spring of 1948. She said that her feelings for me were as before, but she had heard rumors that I had been martyred. At that time, my brother explained that I had recently sent letters home and told her not to believe the rumors lightly. At that time, Li took a cotton coat and returned to school.

    After that, my brother sent three or four letters to the Handan Municipal Middle School and the Handan Mayor and Political Commissar (one of which was attached with an official letter from the Political Department of the First General Team of the Military University to the Handan Municipal Government), but the Handan Municipal Government and the Middle School did not reply for three or four months. It was not until February this year that my brother received a reply from the Judicial Section of the Handan Municipal Government. The handwriting was blurred, and only one sentence could be made out: "The government is not aware of the existence of Li Xianmei." But at the end, it said: "If there are still any unclear points, you can write to inquire..." This is the truth of the matter and the process of handling it.

    Editor, I am a cadre of the People's Liberation Army, and I went south on the orders of the organization. Why did the authorities of Handan Municipal Middle School approve her marriage to another cadre without any investigation? Why could Handan City approve a cadre marrying the wife of a revolutionary cadre without divorce procedures? Moreover, it was done by fabricating my sacrifice as a deceptive means. And why did the Handan Municipal Government and the Middle School completely ignore my problem?

    Now that our Party newspaper has decided to launch criticism and self-criticism, I am determined to first inquire with the newspaper and then appeal to the Central Government Court to seek a reasonable solution. I hope to publish this matter in the newspaper.

    Zhou Wenhuan, Supply Department of the Twelfth Army of the Second Field Army, Chongqing
                                           April 25th

    Editor's Note: Whether the facts stated by Comrade Zhou Wenhuan are true, please Handan Municipal Government investigate immediately and quickly inform this newspaper of the results.

### 革命军人家属另行结婚　二野周文焕来信抗议

　　革命军人家属另行结婚
　　二野周文焕来信抗议编辑同志：
    我名叫周文焕山西省榆社县板坡村人，一九四四年参加太行第二地委干部中学训练班学习三个月，毕业后分配到太谷县政府秘书处工作。一九四六年正月经组织介绍考入晋冀鲁豫军政大学，一九四七年三月毕业，分配到当时晋冀鲁豫的第三纵队六旅供给部工作。七月南下，现在第二野战军十二军供给部工作。
    我南下后，前后出生入死，完成党给我的任务。我与老婆关系一向很好，而且她已由组织介绍入学了，我更放心。谁想到在我们党直接领导的学校中，我的初次出门毫无社会经验的老婆竟被邯郸市政府的一个负有较大责任的干部以造谣撞骗手段侵占去了，而且事后我哥代我给市政府及市中学一再去信，他们置之不理，只有一次用烂麻纸胡写几句吱唔话来抵赖。
    当我由军大毕业将要分配工作时，我的爱人李仙梅，找到我学校来。我被分配到第三纵队后，组织介绍她至六旅后方家属学校（当时住武安），后由家属学校保送到武安高小，又于一九四七年冬保送到邯郸市立中学学习。自我南下后，每隔三四个月，即给我家中与军大我哥去信，同时亦给李仙梅去信。去年五六月，忽接家属学校校长信，说我爱人李仙梅在邯郸中学与另一干部结婚了。不久我哥由军大来信，说李仙梅曾于一九四八年春由学校去军大我哥处（永年七里店村），她说对我感情如旧，但听人传说我已牺牲。当时我哥说明我最近有信给家，叫她勿轻信谣言。当时李取上棉衣即返校了。
    以后我哥给邯郸市立中学及邯郸市长，政委去了三四封信（其中有一次是附有军大一总队政治部给邯郸市政府公函），而邯郸市政府与中学三四个月却不给回信。直到今年二月，我哥始接邯郸市政府司法科复信，字迹糊涂，只看出一句：“政府不知有李仙梅此人。”但最后又说：“如尚有不了解处可来信问……”。事情真象及处理经过就是这样。
    编辑同志，我是人民解放军干部，奉组织命令南下，为什么邯郸市立中学当局竟不经调查，随便批准她与另一干部结婚？为什么邯郸市能批准一个干部与一个未经离婚手续的革命干部的老婆结婚呢？而且中间是用捏造我牺牲的欺骗的手段搞成的。又为什么邯郸市政府与中学根本不理我这问题？
    现在我们党报决定开展批评与自我批评，我决意先向报纸询问一下后，向中央政府法院上告，求得合理解决，希望能在报纸上发表此事。
    重庆市第二野战军第十二军供给部周文焕
                                           四月二十五日
    编者按：周文焕同志所陈述的事实是否真实，请邯郸市政府即时调查，并速将结果告诉本报。
