　　Aid for Unemployed Workers
　  Factory Employees Continue to Donate
    [Report from this newspaper] The movement in Beijing to relieve unemployed workers in Shanghai is continuing to develop. A department of the North China Agricultural Machinery General Factory donated a portion of its invention award money. The Shijingshan Power Plant combined relief work with inspection work. Workers reflected, "Relieving unemployed workers in Shanghai also helps us in our factory's material resources." During the days of voluntary overtime, everyone was very motivated. He Jiangji, the transport foreman, said: "The crane operators never used to work without arguing, but this time it's different. The work is really harmonious." On the overtime day, the automobile repair shop exceeded its usual task by more than one-fifth and guaranteed good quality. In the beginning, a few workers felt that this was Shanghai workers' business and had nothing to do with them, or said, "If I become unemployed, who will help me?" But after understanding the principle that workers all over the world are one family, this phenomenon no longer exists. In addition, the Water Company, Power Plant, News Photography Bureau, and Hongshun Siwei Coal Mine donated an average of more than ten jin of rice per person.

    The employees of the Beijing Brick Factory, affiliated with the West Suburb Central Direct Construction Office, launched a wave of donations under the leadership of Liu Yushen, a brick maker in the brick making section of the factory. Liu donated all of his the value of the 5,204 brick blanks he made, totaling 100,710 yuan.

　　援助失业工人
　  各厂职工继续捐输
    【本报讯】北京市工人救济上海失业工人弟兄的运动继续发展，华北农业机器总厂某部捐出创造发明的奖金的一部分，石景山发电厂把救济工作和清检工作结合搞，工人反映，“救济上海失业工人，也救济了咱厂器材。”在义务加班的日子里，大家情绪十分紧张，运输主任何姜基说：“起重工干活，从来没有一回不抬杠的，这回可变样了，工作真和气。”汽车修配厂在加班那天，超过平日任务五分之一以上，并且保证了好的质量。在开始时，还有少数工人觉得这是上海工人的事，与自己不相干，或者说：“我失业了，谁来救济？”但认识了天下工人是一家的道理后，现在这种现象已经没有了。此外，自来水公司、发电厂、新闻摄影局、宏顺四维煤矿捐款，平均每人超过十斤米以上。
