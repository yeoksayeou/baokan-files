[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] The May Day parade of over 200,000 people in front of Tiananmen Square in the capital the day before yesterday was the first grand review of the people's strength since the founding of the People's Republic of China. This review fully demonstrated the invincible ranks of heroes of the new China.

The parade took place in the rain, but the heavy rain could not shake our heroic parade, but instead inspired our heroic spirit even more.

Look! Our young but brave air force, braving the rain and low-lying clouds, repeatedly appeared over Tiananmen Square after the ground procession began. When the weather cleared up a bit, our squadrons of air force immediately formed up for a demonstration. Looking up at the heroic posture of the air force, many people applauded enthusiastically, and didn't want to stop even when their hands were sore! Why? In the revolutionary wars of the past twenty years, we have hated the reactionary air force and long hoped to establish a people's air force. Everyone knows that as soon as the people's air force appears, the Kuomintang reactionaries will have no trump cards.

The ranks of ground, naval, and air forces, the ranks of workers, the ranks of government employees, the ranks of citizens, and the ranks of women and young students are also invincible. All 200,000 people gathered in the heavy rain and marched in the heavy rain. The respectable military band stood in the heavy rain, constantly playing majestic songs, and the sentries stood upright, guarding all directions of Tiananmen Square. Almost all of these 200,000 people's clothes were soaked, but the hearts of the 200,000 people were as excited and happy as the hearts of the 475 million people of the whole country. Everyone marched forward with firm and majestic steps.

This is the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese nation. With this great spirit, coupled with the pragmatic style advocated by Chairman Mao, after thousands of tenacious battles, we finally drove away imperialism, overthrew bureaucratic capitalism and feudalism, and established the People's Republic of China. We must also use this revolutionary spirit and pragmatic spirit to build our industrialized new country.

Two hundred thousand people are of one heart, and two hundred thousand faces are facing Chairman Mao on the Tiananmen review stand. When they saw Comrade Mao Zedong, who led the Chinese people to achieve great victory, 200,000 people cheered like crazy. Some people jumped up again and again from the ground; some people threw their hats into the sky; some units, when they arrived in front of Tiananmen, only cared about cheering to Comrade Mao Zedong, and even forgot to march, and the command platform had to repeatedly issue the order to "continue moving forward".

The power shown by the May Day parade is huge. On the Tiananmen review stand, around Comrade Mao Zedong, were representatives of the four classes of China, led by the working class, and on the foreign guests' stand in front of the right side of Tiananmen were mainly representatives of countries in the international democratic camp, led by the Soviet Union. These are two strong and solid united fronts, both domestic and foreign, that cannot be defeated.

During the May Day parade, Chairman Mao did not deliver a speech except to raise his hand in salute and applaud, but the parade itself was enough to make the imperialists and remnants tremble. Let them tremble in front of our heroic ranks!

### 英雄的行列

　　英雄的行列
    【本报特写】前天，首都天安门前二十余万人的五一大游行，是中华人民共和国开国以来第一次人民力量的大检阅，这次检阅充分显示了新中国人民无敌的英雄的行列。
    游行在雨中进行，但是，大雨并不能动摇我们英雄的游行队伍，反而更加激发了我们的英雄气概。
    看吧！我们年青的但是勇敢的空军冒着雨和低矮的云层，在地面队伍开始游行之后，一再出现在天安门的上空，天气稍晴时，我们成队的空军立刻编队示威了。仰望着空军的雄姿，好多人纵情地鼓掌，手拍痛了还不愿停止！为什么呢？二十几年来的革命战争中，我们恨透了反动派的空军，老早就盼望建立人民的空军，大家都知道，只要人民的空军一出现，国民党反动派就没有什么王牌了。
    地面陆海空军的行列，工人的行列，机关工作人员的行列，市民的行列，妇女与青年学生的行列，也是无敌的。二十几万人全部在大雨中集合，在大雨中游行。可敬的军乐队一直站在大雨中不停地奏着雄壮的歌曲，哨兵们笔直着身躯警戒着天安门广场的各方。几乎这二十几万人的衣服都湿透了，但是，二十几万人的心却是和全国四万万七千五百万人的心一样的兴奋快乐，大家迈着坚定而雄壮的步伐向前行进。
    这是中华民族的革命精神。凭着这种伟大的精神，加上毛主席所特别提倡的实事求是的作风，经过千百次顽强战斗，我们终于赶走了帝国主义，打倒了官僚资本主义和封建主义，建立了中华人民共和国。我们同样要用这种革命精神和求实精神来建设我们工业化的新国家。
    二十万人是一条心的，二十万张面孔都朝着天安门检阅台上的毛主席。他们看到领导中国人民取得伟大胜利的毛泽东同志时，二十万人都发狂似欢呼，有些人从平地上一再跳起来；有些人就把帽子抛向天空；有些单位到了天安门前面，只顾向毛泽东同志欢呼，竟至忘记了游行，还须要指挥台上一再下“继续前进”的命令。
    五一大游行所显示的力量是巨大的。在天安门检阅台上，在毛泽东同志的四周，团结着以工人阶级为领导的中国四个阶级的代表人物，在天安门右前方的外宾观礼台上，则主要是以苏联为首的国际民主阵营各国的代表，这是不可战胜的国内外的两条强固的统一战线。
    五一检阅时，毛主席除举手回礼及鼓掌之外并没有发表演说，但是大游行的本身，已足使帝国主义者和残匪们发抖了，就让他们在我们英雄的行列面前发抖吧！
