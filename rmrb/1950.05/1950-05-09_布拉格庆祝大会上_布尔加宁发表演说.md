(Xinhua News Agency, May 8th) TASS, Prague: Marshal Bulganin, head of the Soviet government delegation attending the fifth anniversary celebration of Czechoslovakia's liberation, delivered a speech at the Prague celebration rally on the 6th. He first extended warm congratulations and greetings to the Czech working people on behalf of the Soviet people, the Soviet army, and Stalin himself.

　　Bulganin recounted that five years ago, after the Soviet army captured Berlin, a part of the Nazi army in Prague refused to surrender and attempted to destroy the city of Prague. The Soviet army, on the orders of the Supreme Commander Stalin, advanced at full speed and liberated Prague with heroic attacks, and captured a million German soldiers, thus victoriously ending the war against the German aggressors. Due to the victory over the fascist German army, the leadership of the Communist Party, and the will of the working people, Czechoslovakia has become a People's Democratic Republic.

　　Bulganin continued: "The reactionaries, instigated by American and British imperialism, have done everything possible to undermine economic recovery and hinder nationalization and land reform. However, in February 1948, the Czech people shattered the reactionaries' conspiracy with a decisive blow. The fruits of this victory are now known to the world.

　　After the victorious completion of the two-year plan and the first year of the five-year plan, the output of coal, electricity, steel, cement, shoes, and woolen fabrics has exceeded the level of 1937. When this year's plan is completed, industry will exceed twice the level of 1937. Slovakia, originally an agricultural area, is becoming increasingly industrialized. After the land reform, many agricultural cooperatives have been established in rural areas and are advancing on the road to socialism. Socialist competition and shock work are developing on a large scale. After the First World War, it took the Czechs ten years to restore the economy, but this time, after the war, despite the enormous destruction, it was restored in less than two years. The actual income of the Czech industrial masses has increased, large-scale social and cultural measures are being implemented, the doors of higher education institutions are open to young workers and peasants, and the friendship between all nationalities is being strengthened.

　　The outstanding achievements of the Czechoslovak people depend on the great assistance of the Soviet Union. Our common goal is to build a socialist society. Thereafter, we must extensively utilize each other's experience in industry, agriculture, science, and culture, and provide mutual assistance with raw materials, grain, and machinery equipment on a mutually beneficial basis."

　　Bulganin ended his speech amid thunderous cheers, saying: "For five years, the Czechoslovak people have been convinced from their own experience that workers, peasants, and working intellectuals can victoriously govern the country and solve national affairs in the interests of the people. I wish you even greater new victories."

　　布拉格庆祝大会上
    布尔加宁发表演说
    【新华社八日讯】据塔斯社布拉格讯：来捷参加捷克斯洛伐克解放五周年庆祝大会的苏联政府代表团团长布尔加宁元帅，六日在布拉格庆祝大会上发表演说，他首先代表苏联人民、苏军和斯大林本人，向捷克劳动人民致热烈的祝贺和敬礼。
    布尔加宁追述五年之前，当苏军攻克柏林之后，布拉格尚有一部纳粹军队拒不投降，并企图毁灭布拉格城。苏军奉最高统帅斯大林的命令，兼程疾进，以神勇的攻击解放了布拉格，并俘虏百万德军，从而胜利结束了对德国侵略者的战争。由于战胜法西斯德军，由于共产党的领导和劳动人民的意志，捷克斯洛伐克已变成人民民主的共和国了。
    布尔加宁继称：“受美、英帝国主义指使的反动派，曾多方破坏经济复兴，阻挠国有化及土地改革，但是，一九四八年二月，捷克人民以决定性的打击，粉碎了反动派的阴谋。这次胜利的成果现在是举世皆知的了。
    在二年计划和五年计划的第一年计划胜利完成后，煤、电力、钢铁、水泥、靴鞋和毛织品的产量，已超过一九三七年的水平。今年计划完成时，工业将超过一九三七年水平的二倍。本来是农业区的斯洛伐克，已日益工业化。土地改革后，农村中已成立了许多农业合作社，正向社会主义的道路前进。社会主义竞赛和突击工作正在大规模地发展着。在第一次大战后，捷克用十年时间才使经济复原，而这次战后，虽然遭受了巨大的破坏，却不到两年便已恢复了。捷克工业群众的实际收入已告增加，大规模的社会与文化措施正在实现，高等教育机关的大门为工农青年洞开，各族人民的友谊日益加强。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民的卓越成就，有赖于苏联的巨大援助。我们的共同目标是建设社会主义社会，此后还必须广泛互相利用工业、农业、科学与文化上的经验，并在互惠基础之上，以原料、粮食和机器设备进行互助。”
    布尔加宁在雷动的欢呼声中结束其讲演称：“五年以来，捷克斯洛伐克人民已从自己的经验中，确信工人、农民和劳动知识分子能够胜利地治理国家，和按照人民的利益解决国事。敬祝你们获得更大的新的胜利。”
