　　Huainan Mining Bureau Abolishes "Labor Squads"
　　The coal seams at Huainan Coal Mine are very regular, the number of engineering and technical personnel exceeds that of any other coal mine in the country, and there are many skilled workers—its production conditions are quite superior. However, the mine's production efficiency is less than half that of northern mines, and its costs are two to three times higher. Last year, while producing more than one million tons of coal, it also lost more than one million tons of coal. The fundamental reason for this poor situation is the continued existence of the feudal foreman system—the labor squads. It weighs on the workers like a heavy stone, hindering the improvement of production.

　　From "Contracting Cabinets" to "Labor Squads"
　　During the Huaihai Campaign in 1948, the reactionary Huainan Coal Mining Bureau, in order to ease the workers' struggle, changed the large contracting foreman system into "labor squads." The original organization and personnel were not changed at all, only the unlimited exploitation by the foremen in the past was changed to taking a fixed labor code. In the labor squads, there were too many non-production personnel. Bosses, checkers, second bosses, etc., who were neither technically skilled nor qualified, all received large labor codes. Bosses could arbitrarily place their cronies. Each "labor squad" had two or three hundred people, and the work of the "labor squads" was complex and the work locations were very dispersed. "Idling" was very serious, hindering the improvement of production. Workers continued to suffer from the economic exploitation and political oppression of the foremen, and their lives were not guaranteed.
　　The mine has been liberated for more than a year, but the labor squads have not been reorganized. Workers reflected: "When we hear on the surface that we are the masters, we are very happy. But as soon as we go down into the pit and see the bosses, we are terrified." Workers said: "In the past, the bosses were 'tigers,' but after the Communist Party came, they became 'smiling tigers.' Whether they are 'tigers' or 'smiling tigers,' they are still things that eat people."

　　Workers Overthrow the Bosses and Become Masters
　　Starting from April 1, Huainan Mining Bureau launched a comprehensive movement to eliminate feudal foremen.
　　At first, the bosses still attempted to suppress the workers' struggle by means of intimidation. They arrogantly said: "You dare to raise objections to me, good! We'll see who brings down whom, you bringing me down or me bringing you down." Therefore, workers had many concerns when carrying out grievance-airing education. In order to support the workers, the administration formally announced the abolition of the foreman system, the dissolution of the labor squads, and ordered the bosses to bow their heads to the workers and confess their crimes. At the same time, extensive propaganda and education were carried out among the workers to strengthen everyone's confidence in the struggle, and the faces of the workers showed new vitality. A grievance-airing meeting, like a volcanic eruption, lasted for seven hours, and all the crimes of the bosses were exposed. The workers organized under the leadership of the Party, government, and trade union. They overthrew the bosses and democratically elected their own team leaders. They began to work with a completely new attitude, saying, "Now we have truly turned over and become masters of our own house."

### 淮矿取消“劳合班”

　　淮矿取消“劳合班”
    淮南煤矿的煤层非常正规，工程技术人员多于全国任何煤矿，熟练工人又多——它的生产条件是相当优越的。但是，该矿的生产效率不及北方各矿的二分之一，成本则高于北方各矿二倍至三倍。去年一年生产了一百多万吨煤，同时也损失了一百多万吨煤。造成这种恶劣情况的基本原因，是该矿依然存在着封建把头制度——劳合班。它像大石头一样地压在工人头上，阻碍生产的提高。
            从“包工柜”到“劳合班”
    一九四八年淮海战役时，反动的淮南煤矿局为了缓和工人的斗争情绪，曾把大包工头制度改成了“劳合班”。原来的组织和人员没有一点变更，只把过去包工头无限制的剥削，改成了拿一定的工码。在劳合班里，非生产人员太多。头子，查头子，二头子等等没有技术又不称职的人，都拿着大工码。头子可以随便安插私人。每个“劳合班”都有二、三百人，“劳合班”工作性质复杂，工作地点又很分散。“窝工”现象非常严重，阻碍生产的提高。工人依然受着把头的经济剥削和政治压迫，生命都没有保障。
    该矿解放已一年多了，劳合班并没有改组。工人反映说：“在井上听说我们是主人，非常高兴。一下窑见了头子，就胆战心惊。”工人说：“过去头子们是‘老虎’，共产党来了，他们变成‘笑面虎’。不管是‘老虎’是‘笑面虎’，总归是吃人的东西。”
            工人扳倒头子，当家作主
    从四月一日开始，淮矿展开了全面肃清封建把头运动。
    开初，头子们仍然企图以威吓的方法，压制工人的斗争。他们狂妄的说：“你们敢提我的意见，好！咱们走着瞧，看看是你扳倒我，还是我扳倒你。”因此，在进行诉苦教育时，工人顾虑很多。为了给工人撑腰，行政上正式宣布废除把头制，解散劳合班，命令头子们向工人低头认罪。同时，在工人中进行广泛的宣传教育，坚定大家斗争的信心，于是工友们的脸上浮现了新生的活力。像火山爆发一样的诉苦大会，整整进行了七个钟头，头子的罪恶全部被揭露了。工人们在党政工会的领导下组织起来了。他们扳倒了头子，民主选举了自己的组长。他们开始以全新的态度劳动，他们说：“这才翻了身，当家做主人了。”
