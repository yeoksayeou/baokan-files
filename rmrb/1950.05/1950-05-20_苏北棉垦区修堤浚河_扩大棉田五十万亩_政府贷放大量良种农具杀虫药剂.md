[Shanghai News] According to the *Liberation Daily*, the Subei Cotton Reclamation Area will expand its cotton fields by 500,000 mu this year, which is expected to increase the production of ginned cotton by 17,540,000 jin. Together with the original 2,600,000 mu of cotton fields, the total output of ginned cotton in the area this year is estimated to reach 60,024,000 jin. To ensure the implementation of this plan, the Subei Administrative Office carried out water management, improved seed replacement, farm implement repair, and spring plowing fertilization before sowing. Starting last winter, a total of 200,000 laborers were mobilized to repair more than 180 kilometers of sea dikes to protect cotton fields from seawater intrusion. Nine main rivers, including Maoyou, Ziwu, and Zhongzhi, as well as culverts and sluices, were dredged to facilitate drainage and salt leaching. The projects are now nearing completion. Due to last year's floods, cotton seeds were in short supply, so the Administrative Office purchased 130,000 dan of cotton seeds from other provinces and lent them to cotton farmers before Grain Rain. It is also planned to replace all mixed and degraded cotton seeds with improved varieties within three years. The Subei Reclamation Bureau has designated eight pure-seed propagation areas, totaling 600,000 mu of cotton fields, specifically for planting "Dai" and "De" cotton. Recently, the East China Region's Department of Agriculture, Forestry, and Water Conservancy has lent the area 62 tons of DDT and aluminum arsenate insecticides, 3,250 jin of copper preparations, and 60 dusting machines to prevent insect pests. To solve the problem of cotton farmers' tool shortages, 30,000 four-pronged rakes, 8,120 plows, and 300,000 rake teeth have been lent out.

    Counties in the Subei Cotton Reclamation Area have now dispatched cadres to the countryside to guide cotton planting. When cotton farmers heard the decision that the country needs five million spindles of raw cotton and that the Central People's Government stipulates that one jin of raw cotton can be exchanged for six and a half jin of rice, many cotton farmers who had originally planned to convert cotton fields to miscellaneous grains also borrowed and exchanged cotton seeds. Seven counties in the Nantong area will be able to plant 1,770,000 mu of cotton fields this year, an increase of about 200,000 mu compared to last year. In Yancheng area, Dongtai county alone will increase the planting area by 50,000 to 60,000 mu compared to last year. In Binhai County, six townships have reclaimed 16,000 mu of raw and cultivated wasteland as cotton fields and dug more than 1,680 ditches and ports. The cotton field area in Shuangyang Township, Fudong, has increased by 75% compared to last year. Cotton farmers in various places have high enthusiasm for planting cotton and are full of confidence in restoring and expanding cotton fields by 500,000 mu. Currently, cotton planting is continuing in various places, while vigorously carrying out pest control, fertilization, and ditch digging to remove alkali, striving for intensive cultivation to increase cotton yield per unit area.

　　苏北棉垦区修堤浚河
　　扩大棉田五十万亩
　　政府贷放大量良种农具杀虫药剂
    【上海讯】据解放日报消息：苏北棉垦区今年扩大棉田五十万亩，可增产皮棉一千七百五十四万斤；加上原有棉田二百六十万亩，全区今年皮棉总产量预计可达六千零二十四万斤。苏北行政公署为保证此项计划的实施，在下种前进行了治水、改换良种、修置农具、春耕施肥等项工作。从去年冬天开始，先后动员民工二十万，修海堤一百八十余公里，防护棉田免受海水侵害。疏浚卯酉、子午、中直等九条干河及涵闸，以利排水、洗盐。目前工程已将全部完成。又因去年水灾，棉种奇缺，行署又从外省收购棉种十三万担，已于谷雨前贷给棉农。并计划在三年内将混杂退化之棉种全部换为良种。苏北垦务局已划定八处纯种繁殖区，共六十万亩棉田，专植“岱字棉”与“德字棉”。最近华东区农林水利部为防止发生虫害，已贷给该区杀虫药剂滴滴涕及砒酸铝六十二吨，铜制剂三千二百五十斤，和喷粉器六十具。为解决棉农工具困难，并贷放四齿耙三万个，犁八千一百二十架、耙齿三十万根。
    苏北棉垦区各县现已抽调干部下乡，指导植棉工作。当棉农听到全国有五百万纱锭需要原棉、中央人民政府规定一斤原棉换大米六斤半的决定后，许多原想把棉田改种杂粮的棉农也纷纷贷换棉种。南通专区七个县，今年即可播种一百七十七万亩棉田，约比去年扩大二十万亩。盐城专区仅东台一县，即可比去年增加播种面积五万到六万亩。滨海县六个乡，就开垦生熟荒一万六千亩作为棉田，并挖沟开港一千六百八十余条。阜东双洋乡增加棉田面积达去年的百分之七十五。各地棉农植棉情绪很高，对恢复扩大棉田五十万亩，满怀信心。现各地正继续播种棉花，同时大力进行防虫、施肥、挖沟爽碱，作到精耕细作，以增加单位面积的棉花产量。
