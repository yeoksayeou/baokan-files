　　Cotton-Growing Hero Liu Lao Zhi
　　Zhao Huilin Xin Zhenhua

“Learn from labor hero Liu Lao Zhi!” In the cotton planting upsurge in the second district of Ji County, Hebei, this slogan can be heard everywhere; some walls even have such slogans written on them. Liu Lao Zhi is from Xu Village, and is sixty-three years old this year, he has been growing cotton for forty-eight years. Everyone in the district knows that he is a cotton-growing expert. Barren saline-alkali land for many years has been turned into cotton fields in his hands; and his cotton harvest is always more than others on the same quality land. Moreover, he has always actively responded to the government's call. Last year, the government called for planting cotton, and he planted the most in the whole village - twenty mu. Although the harvest was not good last year, Liu Lao Zhi also picked 3,000 jin of seed cotton. The government purchased 800 jin, and after deducting the public grain, he got back 1,050 jin of millet. The remaining 2,200 jin of cotton can be exchanged for more than 7,000 jin of millet; plus the wheat, millet, sorghum, etc. harvested last year, a total of more than 10,000 jin. Enough for a family of ten to eat for three years, achieving the model of getting rich by planting cotton.

Liu Lao Zhi originally had twenty mu of land, and after equal distribution, he added thirty mu. Among them, only twelve mu are high-quality land; the rest are saline-alkali sandy land with "saltpetre leaching". He often thought: "When the 'Kuomintang' was in power, there was no land to grow cotton. Now that Chairman Mao has come, there is land, but what if these saline-alkali lands can't hold the seedlings?" He was determined to make cotton grow in this "barren land". Some people laughed at him and said, "If this land can grow cotton, the sun will rise from the west!" But he was not discouraged. He said, "Farmers must be able to control the land, and cannot let the land control them." After working hard and pondering, he slowly grasped the temper of the saline-alkali land - this kind of land is always wet and prone to moisture, the surface is dry, and the seedlings are killed by alkali as soon as they emerge. So, he came to a conclusion: the saline-alkali land doesn't want to be dry, so you have to make it dry; the saline-alkali land doesn't form clods, so you have to make it form clods. When autumn came, Liu Lao Zhi first spread manure on the field, and then plowed it twice. After the Spring Festival, he plowed it twice again, both times only plowing without harrowing or covering, letting the land dry in the sun and wind. Only when sowing did he harrow it twice, and the sowing was also relatively shallow, with the cotton seeds sown into the moist soil only one finger wide deep (generally one finger upright). As a result, this trial planting was successful, and the seedlings emerged completely. As long as the seedlings take root in saline-alkali land, it is the same as good land. In the autumn, an average of 170 to 180 jin of cotton was picked per mu. This news shocked everyone in the district. When they walked past these saline-alkali lands, they couldn't help but praise, "Liu Lao Zhi has really conquered these alkaline lands!"

Last year, there was a spring drought without rain, and all places adopted spot-sowing of cotton. Liu Lao Zhi thought, "I plan to sow twenty mu, when will I be able to finish sowing?" He and the experienced old farmers in the village jointly worked out a method of sowing with a combined seeder - tying a wooden board to the plough to separate the dry soil to both sides, and then sowing the cotton seeds into the moist soil. Everyone tried it and said it was good. The surrounding villages also adopted this method, which saved a lot of labor and time.

This year, the government specifically called for planting more cotton, and he planted thirty-three mu. He said, "Chairman Mao sits in Beijing, worrying day and night, all for the sake of us ordinary people to live a good life. Chairman Mao tells us to plant more cotton, so we will plant more, and we are guaranteed not to suffer." Some people were worried that the livestock would not have grass to eat and planned to plant some millet; others were worried that there would be no firewood to burn and planned to plant some sorghum. He mobilized them and said, "Cotton is a living treasure. As long as we have cotton, we will have everything." He also instilled in everyone the idea of getting rich by planting cotton. He said, "You all come and see where the millet in my granary comes from?" When sowing cotton, Liu Lao Zhi promptly provided technical guidance to others. This year the ground is wet, and there is a saying among farmers: "Sow shallow when dry, sow deep when wet." But he said, "This year the sowing is early and the ground is cold. If it is too deep, the seedlings will not grow." He also launched a method of exchanging labor and mutual assistance to solve the cotton planting difficulties of many people. Duan Shitou's wife wanted to plant cotton but did not have the labor, so he sowed four mu of cotton for her, and Duan Shitou occasionally spun some thread for him. Li Ersuo didn't know how to use the seeder, so he sowed nine mu for him, and Li Ersuo helped him pick cotton seeds. Under the active leadership of Liu Lao Zhi and the village's party members and cadres, the whole village has now overfulfilled the cotton planting task.

Taking advantage of the fact that everyone is in high spirits, he called on everyone to launch a fertilizer accumulation campaign after planting cotton. He said, "'People rely on food for strength, and land relies on manure for strength'. If you want to harvest more cotton this year, the first thing is to apply more fertilizer." He himself plans to apply at least three large cartloads of manure per mu. Every day, Liu Lao Zhi comes back from the field and picks up manure with a manure basket; he picks up manure when there is a market. He also contracted the manure from the primary school for 120 jin of millet, which can produce fifteen large cartloads of manure in a season. He also went to Nangong to exchange cotton for 1,200 jin of soybean cake and 200 jin of sesame oil sauce. Liu Lao Zhi introduced his fertilization experience to everyone: topdressing can be divided into two times - once when thinning seedlings, which can promote growth, and once when knots form, which can promote flowering. You have to apply it while hoeing, otherwise it will be blown away by the wind. Don't put the fertilizer too close to the roots, lest it burn the cotton to death." At the same time, he suggested that this year we should hoe more, "Seven times for millet, eight times for cotton", the benefit of hoeing is that "good land gets wetter with hoeing, and saline-alkali land gets drier with hoeing". Hoeing can start when the seedlings emerge five inches from the ground, and continue until flowering. If it rains, hoe it once after each rain. In addition, thinning seedlings should be "three seedlings in one step (about five city feet), not too dense. "Cotton bends over, one plant harvests one jin". When the beginning of autumn comes, get the cotton tops and pay attention to cutting off the crazy branches.

This year, there have been two spring rains in a row, and the wheat is growing green and lush. The old hero often looks at these wheat fields, stroking his gray beard and smiling, "With favorable weather, 'cotton and wheat share the same roots', I think this year's cotton harvest is already in hand!"

　　种棉英雄刘老志
　　赵辉林　辛振华
    “向劳动英雄刘老志看齐!”河北冀县二区在种棉热潮中，到处可以听到这口号；有的墙上还写着这样的标语。刘老志是徐家庄人，今年六十三了，他种了四十八年棉花。全区的人都知道他是个种棉能手，多年不毛的砂碱地，在他手里变成了棉田；同样的十成地，他的棉花也总比别人收的多。并且，他一贯积极地响应政府号召。去年，政府号召种棉花，全村种得最多的就是他——种了二十亩。虽然去年收成不好，但刘老志也拾了三千斤籽棉，政府收买了八百斤，减去公粮，又找回一千零五十斤小米。剩下两千二百斤棉花，可换七千多斤小米；再加上去年收的麦子、谷子、高粱等，共合一万多斤。足够全家十口人吃三年，达到耕一余二，创造了种棉发家的范例。
    刘老志原有二十亩地，平分后，又添了三十亩。这里面只有十二亩是十成地；其余都是“淋硝盐”的砂碱地。他时常想：“‘国民党’在时，想种棉花没有地，现在毛主席来了，有了地，可是这些砂碱地拿不住苗怎么办？”他下决心要使这“不毛之地”里长出棉花来。有的人笑他说：“这地要能长出棉花，除非日头从西边出来！”但他不泄气，他说：“庄稼人要能拿住地，可不能让地拿住人。”经过他下工夫和苦心捉摸，慢慢地摸住了砂碱地的脾气——这种地是万年湿，肯反潮，地皮干巴，苗一露头，就被碱死了。于是，他得出一个结论：砂碱地不肯干，就是要叫它干；砂碱地不起坷垃，就是要叫它起坷垃。秋天到了，刘老志先在地里铺上粪，然后耕两遍。过了春节，再耕两遍，都是光耕不耙，也不盖，让地晒着，多让风吹，直到耩时，才耙了两遍，耩的也比较浅，棉耔耩到湿土里只有一扁指深（一般的是一立指）。结果，这一次试种成功了，苗出的很齐全，砂碱地只要一拿住苗，那就同好地一样。秋后，一亩地也平均拾了一百七、八十斤棉花。这消息震动了全区的每一个人，当他们从这些砂碱地旁边走过时，就不禁夸奖着说：“刘老志可把这些碱地拿住了！”
    去年，春旱不雨，各地都是采用点种棉花。刘老志想：“我打算耩二十亩，啥时才能耩完呢？”他就同村里有经验的老农共同捉摸出用套耧耩的办法——在犁头上捆个木板，先把干土分到两边，然后，把棉籽耩到湿土里。大家一试验，都说好，周围村子也都采用了这个办法，省了很多劳动力与时间。
    今年，政府特别号召要多种棉花，他种了三十三亩。他说：“毛主席坐在北京，日夜操心，还不都是为着咱老百姓过好日子，毛主席叫咱多种棉花，咱就多种，保管不会吃亏。”有些人顾虑牲口没草吃，打算种点谷子；还有些人顾虑没柴烧，打算种点高粱，他就动员说：“棉花就是个活宝贝，只要有了棉花，就啥也有了。”他又向大家灌输种棉发家思想，他说：“你们都来看我囤里的小米是从那里来的？”耩棉时，刘老志及时向别人进行技术指导。今年地皮湿，这里有句农谚是：“干耩浅，湿耩深。”但他说：“今年耩的早，地寒，太深了，苗就长不出来了。”他又发动用换工互助的办法，解决了许多人的种棉困难。段石头媳妇想种棉花，没有劳动力，他就替她耩了四亩棉花，段石头老落给他纺点线。李二锁不会拿耧，他也替他耩了九亩，李二锁帮他拾拾花籽。在刘老志和全村党员、干部积极带动下，现在全村已经超计划地完成了种棉任务。
    趁大家正在劲头上，他又号召大家要在种棉之后，展开积肥运动。他说：“‘人是饭力，地是粪力’，今年要想多收棉花，头一宗就是多上粪。”他自己打算每亩地至少上三大车粪。每天，刘老志从地里回来，就背着粪筐拾粪；有集赶集拾粪。小学里的粪，他也用一百二十斤小米包下来，一季可以出十五大车粪。又到南宫用棉花换了一千二百斤豆饼，和二百斤小磨香油酱。刘老志向大家介绍自己的施肥经验：上追肥可分两次——间苗时一次，可以发棵、结桃时一次可以长花。要一边上，一边用锄耪，不然就会被风刮跑了。上粪不要太靠根，免得把棉花烧死。”同时，他提出今年要多锄，“七遍谷子八遍花”，锄的好处是“好地越锄越湿，砂碱地越锄越干”。苗出土五寸时就可开锄，一直锄到开花。要是下雨的话，每下一次雨要锄一遍。另外，间苗要“一步（约合五市尺）三棵苗），不要太密。“棉花弯开身，一棵收一斤”。到立秋时拿棉顶，并要注意打疯杈。
    今年连下两次春雨，麦子长得绿油油的，老英雄时常望着这些麦子，捋着花白胡子笑着说：“风调雨顺了‘棉麦一条根’，我看今年这棉花又算收到手啦！”
