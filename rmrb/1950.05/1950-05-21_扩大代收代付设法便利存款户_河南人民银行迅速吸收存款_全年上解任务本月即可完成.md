Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 16th -- The Henan Branch of the People's Bank of China has completed its deposit absorption and remittance task ahead of schedule. The Central China District Branch of the People's Bank assigned the Henan Branch an average deposit balance task of 118.728 billion yuan for the entire year. According to the remittance ratio of 61%, the Henan Branch should remit 72.32408 billion yuan for the entire year. As of late April, the average deposit balance of the branch had reached 147.2 billion yuan, exceeding the average deposit balance of 83.1096 billion yuan that should have been absorbed in April by 64.0904 billion yuan. As of April 28th, the branch had remitted over 70.02028 billion yuan, only 2.3 billion yuan short of the total amount to be remitted to the head office for the entire year. The branch plans to remit the entire amount in early May.

The Henan Branch of the People's Bank of China was able to complete the deposit absorption and remittance task ahead of schedule not only because of stable prices and increased currency deposits, as well as the fact that all agencies and enterprises deposit cash into the bank as required after the implementation of cash management, but also because the bank actively adopted various measures to absorb deposits. First, the Henan Branch expanded the scope of collection and payment. For example, the business department of the provincial branch in Kaifeng collected electricity fees for the electricity company, and the Zhengzhou sub-branch collected fines for the court. Second, it helped depositors develop capital utilization plans. For example, the Nanguan office of the business department developed a capital utilization plan for the Water Conservancy Section based on the timing of water conservancy funding, and absorbed fixed deposits with different terms of ten days, twenty days, and one month. Third, it actively served depositors and consolidated old depositors. For example, the Dongguan office in Kaifeng not only consolidated existing depositors by helping depositors exchange and purchase public bonds, handling savings deposit procedures, and clearing bills, but also introduced nine new depositors through the original depositors. Fourth, it strengthened external relations with all sectors. For example, the external staff of the Zhengzhou sub-branch introduced sales of goods from out-of-town public enterprises to shops and stores, collected payments for goods, and absorbed deposits from traveling merchants in hotels. In addition, the branch also strengthened staff training and strived to improve work efficiency. In the past, it took seven minutes to process a remittance and eight minutes to process a deposit, but now it has been reduced to five minutes. Most cadres realize the role of absorbing deposits in stabilizing prices, and therefore their work enthusiasm has generally increased.

　　扩大代收代付设法便利存款户
    河南人民银行迅速吸收存款
    全年上解任务本月即可完成
    【新华社汉口十六日电】中国人民银行河南省分行提早完成吸收存款上解任务。人民银行中南区行分配给河南省分行全年吸收存款平均余额的任务为一千一百八十七亿二千八百万元。按上解百分之六十一的规定，河南省分行全年应上解七百二十三亿二千四百零八万元。截至四月下旬止，该行存款平均余额已达一千四百七十二亿元，较四月份应吸收存款平均余额八百三十一亿零九百六十万元，超过了六百四十亿九千零四十万元。截至四月二十八日止，该行已上解七百亿二千零二十八万余元，距全年应上解总行数字仅二十三亿余万元。该行拟在本月初旬全部缴齐。
    人民银行河南省分行所以能提前完成吸收存款上解任务，除了物价平稳、货币存款增加，以及实行现金管理后，各机关企业现金按规定存入银行等基本原因外，该行积极采取了各种办法吸收存款也是重要的原因。首先是河南省分行扩大了代收代付的范围。如省分行营业部在开封市为电灯公司收电费，郑州市支行代法院收罚金。其次是帮助存款户订资金运用计划。如该行营业部南关办事处替水利科按水利经费运用时间，订出资金运用计划，吸收了按十天、二十天、一个月的不同期限的定期存款。再次就是积极为存款户服务，巩固旧存户，如开封市的东关办事处由于代存户换购公债，代办折实储蓄手续、清算账单等，不但巩固了原有存户，而且经原存户介绍了九家新存户。第四是加强外勤与各界广泛的联系。如郑州市支行外勤人员为外来公营企业介绍行店销货，代收货款，到旅馆里吸收行商存款等。此外该行并加强工作人员的学习，努力提高工作效率。过去办理一笔汇款需要七分钟，办理一笔存款要八分钟，现在都缩减到五分钟。大部分干部都认识到吸收存款对平稳物价的作用，因而工作热忱普遍提高。
