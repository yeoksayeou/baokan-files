　　Labor Songs Resound Throughout Beihai
　　北京市公安纵队 Ting
　　The fiery sun had just risen from the foot of the eastern sky, its light spreading evenly over Beijing. Comrades from various units participating in production, carrying shovels and shoulder poles, hurried towards Beihai to dig out the foul mud. This was a clear day in mid-April.

　　By a little after seven, everyone had arrived, identified their areas, and prepared their tools. They all took off their trousers, baring their legs. After a burst of gongs and drums, they all began to work diligently, each trying to outdo the others, according to the planned methods. Commander Luo, Political Commissar Yuan, and Deputy Commander Zhang all stood among the team members, working together. When the leaders heard the team members say, "Our leaders are not strong, don't get sick from the cold. We'll do an extra shovel's worth, and the leaders can just direct," they challenged the team members: "Don't think we're weak, we won't fall behind when it comes to work! Come on! Let's do it! I'll dig, you carry!" This sparked another wave of mutual challenges among the team members. The songs of labor resounded throughout Beihai.

　　The mud in Beihai was very deep, one foot coming out as the other went in. The people carrying mud moved non-stop, carrying load after load to the back of the small hill. The strong young men were covered in sweat, and the section chiefs were all taking the lead. Section Chief Li from the Propaganda Section, Section Chief Liu from the Security Section, and Section Chief Yuan from the Police Education Section all filled their baskets to the brim and walked quickly, rarely resting. Section Chief Guo from the Organization Section, a small man, worked silently in the ditch, without saying a word. Some comrades pointed to Comrade Yu Guirong, Section Chief Guo's wife, and said: "You have to learn from Lao Guo, don't fall behind!"

　　The younger ones, the weaker ones, dug mud with all their might, carrying it and running. The comrades said with concern, "Hey! Do a little less! I'll take over if you're not strong enough!" The female comrades from the Logistics Department worked hard in the sea, barefoot and covered in mud, going in and out, excited and happy, constantly singing "The working class has strength." The songs from all sides mixed together and spread in all directions, and the children swinging on the swings in the children's playground also joined in. An old woman on the shore said: "It's truly liberation! Everyone working together, singing and laughing, it's really wonderful!"

　　The comrades from each regiment worked enthusiastically with their regimental leaders. Every unit was striving to be a labor model and complete the Beihai project ahead of schedule.

　　The comrades all set learning plans for their rest time: learning Russian, learning culture, learning theory, reading newspapers. Look! They were all reading newspapers or discussing issues in groups of three or five in the shade of the trees. Beihai had become a classroom again.

　　The days passed quickly in excitement and joy. At five o'clock in the afternoon, work was finished. Each comrade checked and cleaned their tools before stepping into the returning ranks.

　　劳动歌声响遍北海
    北京市公安纵队  汀
    火红的太阳刚从东天脚下升起，光明平铺在北京。各单位参加生产的同志，都扛着锹，挑着担子，快步地走向北海，去掏挖臭泥。这是四月中的一个晴朗的日子。
    七点多钟人到齐了，认清了地区，装配了生产工具，便都脱掉了长裤，光着腿；一阵锣鼓响后，都按着计划好的方法，各自争先恐后地干起来。罗总长、袁政委、张副总长，都站在队员中一块干。当首长们听到队员说：“咱们首长身体弱，别冻出病来，我们多干一锹就有了，首长在指挥就成了”之后，就向队员们挑起战来：别看我们身体弱，干起活来，绝不落后，来！干！我挖你抬！这又引起了队员们互相挑战的热潮。劳动的歌声响遍了北海。
    北海泥水很深，这脚出来，那脚进去。抬泥的人们马不停蹄似的，一担担抬向小山后头，棒小伙子们满头是汗，各科长都起着带头作用。宣教科的李科长，保卫科的刘科长，警教科的袁科长，土担了满了担子，走的飞快，很少休息。组织科的郭科长，小个子，闷着头在水沟里干，一声不语。有的同志指着郭科长的爱人于桂容同志说：你得向老郭看齐，别落了后啊！
    年纪小的，身体弱的，用劲挖泥，抬着飞跑，同志们关心地喊道：哎！你们少干一点吧！身体弱我来！后勤处的女同志在海里大卖力气，光着腿，满身泥，出来进去，兴奋愉快，不时唱着“咱们工人有力量”的歌子。四面的歌声搅成了一团，又向四方飞散，在儿童运动场打秋千的小朋友们也应声唱起来。岸边有位老大娘说：真是解放了，大家伙儿一块劳动，又唱又笑真是痛快！
    各团的同志，和团首长在一起干的热火朝天，每个单位都蹩着劲，争取劳动模范，提前完成北海工程。
    同志们都订了休息时间的学习计划：学俄文，学文化，学理论，读报。你看！他们三五成群地都在树荫下阅读书报或讨论问题，北海又变成了课堂。
    日子在兴奋快愉中过的真快，下午五时收了工。每个同志把自己的工具检查、洗刷干净后，迈进了待归的队伍里来。
