    I. Cutworms

    Cutworms, also known as cutworm larvae or soil silkworms, are pests that harm cotton seedlings. There are three or four common types, among which the most harmful is the small cutworm, which occurs most frequently in moist, sandy soil. Its entire body, except for its yellow head, is grayish-brown; when disturbed, its body curls up. It hides in the soil during the day and comes out at night to bite off cotton seedlings, often dragging the severed parts into soil burrows as food. When the damage is severe, there are too many missing cotton seedlings, and replanting is necessary. They are most severe in May and June. The prevention and control methods are as follows:

    (1) Heap grass for luring and killing: In areas where cutworms occur frequently, pay attention to weeding. Before the cotton seedlings emerge, use fresh, tender weeds, or waste leaves such as cabbage and lettuce, and pile them on the ground in the evening to attract cutworms to eat. The piles should be one foot wide and five inches high, with each pile spaced ten feet apart. Check each pile every two to three days. When there are many insects, dozens of insects can be caught in each pile. At the same time, replace the piles with fresh grass, or water them to keep them moist and tender. After several such captures, there will not be many insects left in the ground.

    (2) Scatter poisonous bait: After cotton sowing, mix one pound of red alum with twenty-five pounds of wheat bran evenly, then add twenty-five pounds of water to make poisonous bait. Scatter it on the ground in the evening, about eight pounds per acre. The insects will be poisoned and die after eating it.

    (3) Capture early in the morning: After the cotton seedlings emerge, inspect the fields every morning. If you see seedlings being bitten off, dig in the soil nearby to search for and kill them.

    II. Cotton Aphids

    Cotton aphids, also known as honey aphids, greasy aphids, or drought aphids, are the most serious pests during the cotton seedling stage. Once cotton seedlings become infested, they must be treated promptly, otherwise serious losses will occur. Because aphids reproduce extremely quickly, in just a few days the cotton seedlings will have curled branches and leaves, and in severe cases, the entire plant will wither and die. In mild cases, growth will be hampered, fruit bolls will be reduced, maturity will be delayed, and yields will be reduced by one-third. Therefore, from May to July, we must check the cotton fields at any time. If three or four aphids are found on a cotton leaf, treatment should begin. Generally, cotton seedlings need to be treated about twice during the seedling stage. If serious infestations occur after flowering, treatment will have to be done again. The control methods of cotton aphids are as follows:

    (1) Eradicate weeds to prevent cotton aphids: In the North China area, when cotton leaves wither and turn yellow in October, cotton aphids fly to swallowtail grass, duckling seedlings, cottontail grass, bitter vegetable (all the same grass, different names in different places), summer dry grass (local name 'turn-turn grass') and other weeds, and lay eggs at the roots to overwinter. In March of the following year, the eggs hatch into young aphids, crawl out of the soil, and reproduce on the weeds for several generations. When the cotton seedlings grow to three or four inches high, the cotton aphids fly from these weeds to the cotton seedlings in groups to cause harm. According to previous investigations, swallowtail grass is almost the only overwintering host weed for cotton aphids in the south-central Hebei area. According to this year's April survey in the Linfen cotton area of ​​Shanxi Province, in addition to swallowtail grass, summer dry grass is also very common. Cotton aphids occur extremely frequently on these two types of weeds, with as many as 1,000 or more on one plant. The average parasitism rate of summer dry grass accounts for 84.4%, and swallowtail grass accounts for 56.6%, while in non-cotton areas, the former only accounts for 6.7%, and the latter only accounts for 3.3%. This proves that these two types of weeds are the cotton pest host weeds in the southern Shanxi cotton area. Therefore, in each cotton area, every household must thoroughly eradicate these two types of weeds, including the roots, and bury them deep underground before April, which may have a significant effect on preventing the occurrence of cotton aphids.

    (2) Control cotton aphids: If cotton aphids have already occurred on cotton seedlings, various methods should be used to control them. All effective and readily available local pesticides can be used. In addition to sprayers, immersion methods can also be used to spread the liquid medicine, that is, putting the liquid medicine in a bowl or basin to immerse the cotton plants, such as using a specially made tin plate one inch high and six or seven inches in diameter to hold the medicine for immersion, which is especially convenient to use. During the young stage of cotton plants, the immersion method saves more medicine than using a sprayer. Several effective control agents are listed below for local reference and selection.

    (1) Tobacco water: Soak one pound of tobacco leaves in fifty pounds of cold water for one day and one night, filter it with linen cloth, add a small amount of soybean flour or flour paste to the filtered tobacco leaf water, stir evenly, and it can be used.

    (2) Tobacco lime water: First soak one pound of tobacco leaves in ten pounds of cold water for one day and one night, then gradually add water to one pound of quicklime until it is diluted to ten pounds, filter them all with linen cloth to remove the residue. When using, mix the two kinds of water together, then add forty pounds of water and stir evenly.

    (3) Cotton oil soap liquid: Cotton oil soap is the black oil residue left over from bleaching cottonseed oil. The villagers call it black pancreas. It is a very good and economical aphid-killing agent. Soak one pound of cotton oil soap in a small amount of hot water. After it is completely dissolved, add one hundred to one hundred and twenty pounds of cold water and stir evenly.

    (4) Rotenone powder liquid agent: Put one pound of rotenone powder (the finer the powder, the better) in a gauze bag, soak it in a small amount of water, slowly rub it with both hands to make the medicine powder completely wet, then turn the bag over, put the medicine in the water, add water to 1200 pounds and stir evenly (the fineness of the medicine powder and the length of storage time have a great impact on the insecticidal effect. Therefore, the amount of water added must be tested before application before deciding on the amount of water added. Also, if the powder particles are too coarse, filter it with gauze before application to avoid blocking the nozzle of the sprayer).

    III. Red Spider Mites

    Red spider mites, also known as fire dragons or fire beads, are very harmful, especially during droughts. They overwinter on weeds and reproduce on weeds for several generations in the spring of the following year. When the cotton grows, they move to the cotton plants and form spider webs on the back of the leaves to cause harm. After the cotton leaves are damaged, they turn red, and the edges of the leaves curl towards the back. In severe cases, the leaves fall off. The control methods are as follows:

    (1) Preventive measures: Red spider mites overwinter on weeds, so eradicating weeds is an important preventive measure. In addition, mulberry trees, soybeans, sesame, cowpeas, etc. are also their favorite foods, and they are often severely damaged. Therefore, mulberry trees should not be planted near cotton areas. Villagers always like to replant sesame or soybeans in the missing cotton plants or field boundaries, which is the main reason for increasing the harm to cotton plants. We must pay attention to avoid this.

    (2) Pesticide control: If red spider mites have already occurred, quick action should be taken to control them with pesticides. Start with the lightly damaged areas around the perimeter, adopt an encirclement strategy, and finally eliminate the heavily damaged areas, so as to prevent them from spreading. Treat them again one week later to kill the small insects that have just hatched from the eggs. Commonly used effective methods are:

    (1) Flour paste: Use one pound of flour and eight pounds of boiling water to make a paste, then add fifty-six pounds of cold water, stir evenly, and spray it on the back of the leaves with a sprayer on a sunny day. Apply 200 to 300 pounds of paste per acre.

    (2) Spray sulfur powder: Use extremely fine sulfur powder and spray it evenly with a powder spreader on a sunny, windless morning or evening. Apply one to one and a half pounds per acre.

　　防治棉虫
    中央人民政府农业部病虫害防治局
    一、地老虎
    地老虎又名切根虫或土蚕，是害棉苗的害虫。常见的有三、四种，其中为害最大的，叫小地老虎，湿润沙质土壤里发生顶多。全身除头部为黄色外，都是灰褐色；受到惊扰，身体就卷曲起来。它白天躲在土里，晚上出来咬断棉苗，常将切断部分拖入土穴里当食料。为害重时，棉苗缺株过多，要重新播种，以五、六月间为害最烈。其防治方法如下：
    （一）堆草诱杀：地老虎发生多的地方，要注意除草工作，在棉苗未出土之前，傍晚时用新鲜柔嫩的杂草，或甘蓝莴苣等废叶堆在地里，引诱地老虎来吃。堆宽一尺，高五寸。每堆距离各十尺，可隔两三天逐堆翻查一次。虫多时，每堆可捕虫数十头。同时堆下另换新草，或浇些水使保持湿润柔嫩，这样捕杀数次，地下所剩的虫子不多了。
    （二）撒布毒饵，棉花播种后，用红矾一斤，麦麸二十五斤，混和均匀，再加水二十五斤，调成毒饵。傍晚时撒在地里，每亩约八斤，虫子吃后即被毒死。
    （三）清早捕捉：棉苗出土后，每天清早在田间巡查。如见苗被咬断，即在附近扒土搜杀。
    二、棉蚜
    棉蚜又叫蜜虫、腻虫或旱虫，这是棉苗时期最厉害的害虫。棉苗生腻以后，就要及时除治，否则就要受到严重损失。因为蚜虫繁殖极快，不要多天棉苗就枝叶卷缩，重者全株枯死，轻者生长受到挫折，果铃减少，延迟成熟，产量要减收三分之一。因此，在五至七月间我们要随时到棉地检查，如果棉叶上发现有三、四个蚜虫时，就要开始除治。普通在棉苗时期，大概除治两次，开花后如遇严重发生时，还得再治一次。棉蚜的防治方法如下：
    （一）铲除杂草预防棉蚜：在华北一带，十月间棉叶枯黄，棉蚜就飞到燕儿尾，鸭鸭苗，兔儿草，苦麻菜（都是一样草，各地名称不同）夏枯草（土名转转草）等杂草上，在根部产卵越冬。第二年三月卵孵化为幼蚜，爬出土面，就在杂草上繁殖数代，等到棉苗长到三四寸高时，棉蚜就成群从这些野草上飞到棉苗上来为害。根据以往调查，燕儿尾冀中南一带，差不多是棉蚜唯一的越冬寄生草，又据今年四月在山西省临汾棉区调查，除燕儿尾外，夏枯草也很普遍。在这两种野草上，棉蚜发生极多，一株上有多到一千个以上，平均寄生率夏枯草占百分之八四点四，燕儿尾占百分之五六点六，而在非棉区，前者仅占百分之六点七，后者仅占百分之三点三。由此可以证明，这两种野草是晋南棉区的棉虫寄生草。因此，各棉区家家户户要在四月以前，把这两种野草彻底的连根铲除干净，深埋地下，对于预防棉蚜发生，可能发生很大的作用。
    （二）除治棉蚜：棉苗上如已发生棉蚜，就要用各种方法来除治。凡是有效的而又供应方便的土药都可以使用。撒布药液的器具，除喷雾器外，还可以用浸沾法，即是把药液盛在碗或盆里来浸沾棉株，如特制高一寸直径六、七寸洋铁盘盛药来浸沾，使用起来，格外方便。在棉株幼小时期，使用浸沾法比用喷雾器还省药。兹将有效的几种除治药剂写在下面，供各地参考选用。
    （１）烟草水：烟叶一斤，泡在五十斤冷水中一昼夜，用麻布过滤，把滤下的烟叶水加少量大豆粉或面粉糊搅拌均匀，即可使用。
    （２）烟草石灰水：先把烟叶一斤泡在十斤冷水中一昼夜，再将生石灰一斤，逐渐加水至十斤化开，均用麻布过滤，去掉渣渣，使用时将两种水混合起来，再加四十斤水搅匀即成。
    （３）棉油皂液：棉油皂是漂棉籽油所剩下来的黑油渣子，老乡们叫黑胰子，是很好而经济的杀蚜药剂。把棉油皂一斤泡在少量热水中，等到完全溶解后，再加冷水一百斤至一百二十斤搅拌均匀即成。
    （４）鱼藤粉液剂：将鱼藤粉（粉粒愈细愈好）一斤，装在纱布袋内，泡在少量水中，用双手慢慢揉搓，使药粉全部湿透，然后将袋翻转，把药放在水中，再加水至一千二百斤搅拌均匀即成（药粉的粗细和保存时间的久暂，对于杀虫效力有很大影响，因此，加水量多少，必须在施用前，先行试验，再决定加水量。又粉粒如果过粗，施用前要用纱布过滤，以免阻塞喷雾器的喷口）。
    三、红蜘蛛
    红蜘蛛又名火龙或火珠子，为害很大，尤其是天旱的时候。它在杂草上过冬，翌年春暖在杂草上繁殖几代，等到棉花成长后，就转移到棉株上，在叶子反面结成蛛网，在内为害。棉叶受害后，变成红色，叶边向背面卷曲，重者叶脱。它的除治法，有下面几种：
    （一）预防办法：红蜘蛛是在杂草上过冬的，所以铲除杂草是一个重要的预防工作，此外，桑树、大豆、芝麻、豇豆等，也是它最喜欢吃的，受害常很重。因此，棉区附近不可栽桑，棉田缺株或地界沟，老乡们总喜补种芝麻或大豆，这是增加棉株受害最主要的原因，要切实注意避免。
    （二）药剂除治：红蜘蛛业已发生，应赶快用药除治，先从四周围轻害区治起，采取包围形势，最后再消灭重害区，这样可以使其不能蔓延开来，并且要隔一星期再治一次，使从孵初卵化出来的小虫，再一次的被杀死。常用的有效方法是：
    （１）面粉糊：面粉一斤，用开水八斤，做成浆糊，再加冷水五十六斤，搅拌均匀，在晴天用喷雾器撒布在叶之反面，每亩施用量二百至三百斤糊。
    （２）喷硫黄粉：用极细的硫黄粉，在晴天无风的早晨或傍晚，以撒粉器喷布均匀即成，每亩施用一斤至一斤半。
