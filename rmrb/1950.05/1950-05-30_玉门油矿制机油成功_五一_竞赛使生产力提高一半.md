　　Yumen Oilfield Successfully Produces Machine Oil
    “May Day” Competition Increases Productivity by Half
    [Our Newspaper, Yumen] The Yumen Oilfield, liberated less than a year ago, has now achieved brilliant results. In order to fulfill the ardent hopes of the people of the whole country, the workers of the mine, after arduous experimentation and research, began producing machine oil on April 24th. The product contains no crystalline wax or moisture, and its quality meets specifications.
    The leading cadres of the mine resolutely relied on the masses of workers and established a democratic management committee. The trade union also implemented the correct policy of orienting itself towards production. In the "May Day" production emulation campaign, production efficiency generally increased by 50%. The output of individual units and individuals has reached five or six times that before liberation. At present, the refinery's gasoline output has exceeded 13% before liberation, and kerosene output has exceeded 55% before liberation. Electric welder Cao Weiya created a new record of welding 205 feet in one day. Mason Zhang Yixian created the highest record of laying 1,580 bricks a day when building a boiler. By May Day this year, more than 500 workers in the mine had made meritorious contributions and wrote down their contributions to China's petroleum industry in the congratulatory books.
    On "May Day," all the employees of the Yumen Oilfield wrote a letter to Chairman Mao. The letter said: "Our dear Chairman Mao: The Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army led by you liberated the workers of Yumen Oilfield, allowing us to get rid of our life as beasts of burden and become masters of our own factory." They excitedly reported to Chairman Mao the increase in production at the factory and promised to continue to increase production and quality on the basis of the existing production.

　　玉门油矿制机油成功
    “五一”竞赛使生产力提高一半
    【本报玉门讯】解放不到一年的玉门油矿，现在已创造出辉煌的成绩。该矿职工为了实现全国人民殷切的热望，经过艰苦的试验研究，已于四月二十四日，开始出产机油，产品不含结晶蜡及水分，质量合乎规格。
    该矿领导干部坚决依靠工人群众，成立了民主管理委员会。工会也执行了面向生产的正确方针。在迎接“五一”生产立功竞赛运动中，生产效率普遍提高百分之五十，个别单位和个人的产量，有高达解放前五、六倍的。现炼厂汽油产量已超过解放前百分之十三，煤油产量超过解放前百分之五十五。电焊工人曹维亚创造了一天电焊二百零五尺的新纪录。泥工张易先在垒锅炉时，创造日砌砖一千五百八十块的最高纪录。到今年五一那天止，该矿已有五百多名工友立了功，在贺功书上写下了他们对中国石油事业的功绩。
    在“五一”节，玉门油矿全体职工给毛主席写了一封信。信上说：“我们的亲人毛主席：你领导的共产党和解放军解放了玉门油矿工人，使我们摆脱了牛马生活，翻身做了自家工厂的主人。”他们兴奋地向毛主席报告了该厂增加生产的情况，并且保证在现有的生产基础上，再接再厉，继续提高产量质量。
