To the Editor:

    I am a tricycle worker from Beijing. Not long ago, I was transferred to the Northwest. After arriving in the Northwest, the People's Government distributed eight or nine mu of land, a tile-roofed house, furniture, and other items to me, so there is no problem with my livelihood. The local villagers also often help us with our work. Our production is doing very well. Recently, I returned to Beijing to pick up my family, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Beijing People's Government and the Wudong County Government of Suiyuan on behalf of the transferred workers of the Second District of Beijing!

　　转业到西北的三轮工人来信向政府致谢编辑同志：
    我是京市三轮工人，不久前转业到西北去的。到了西北后，人民政府分给我八九亩地、一间瓦房，还有家具以及其他的东西，生活毫无问题。当地老乡们还常常帮助我们干活。我们的生产搞得挺好。最近我回到北京来接眷后，顺便代表北京二区的转业工人向北京人民政府及绥远武东县政府致谢！
