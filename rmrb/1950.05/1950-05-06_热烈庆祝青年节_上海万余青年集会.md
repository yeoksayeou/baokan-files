Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 4th. Over 14,000 young people from all walks of life in Shanghai, including workers, students, military personnel, and suburban farmers, held a grand evening party at the Shanghai Racecourse, the largest square in Shanghai, on the evening of the 3rd to celebrate Chinese Youth Day and the first anniversary of the founding of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. Soviet youth were also invited to participate. The conference began with a speech by Zhang Ben, Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Working Committee of the Youth League. He pointed out that since the establishment of the League in Shanghai last August, it now has more than 60,000 Youth League members and more than 30,000 Young Pioneers, who have played a significant role in the struggle against blockade and bombing. He called on Shanghai youth to strengthen unity and strive to overcome the current temporary economic difficulties. Then, Mayor Chen Yi spoke, repeatedly encouraging Shanghai youth and Youth League members to carry forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of the "May Fourth" Movement, adhere to their work and study posts, and assist the People's Government in overcoming difficulties. Professor Zhou Yutong of Fudan University, who personally participated in the "May Fourth" Movement, reported to the conference on the significance of commemorating "May Fourth." Chen Yan, a first-class people's hero of the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, and youth league members who are labor heroes of the Shanghai Electric Power Company and first-class meritorious workers from the Aurora University Medical College participating in military treatment work (treating schistosomiasis) spoke successively, all describing the role played by Chinese youth in overcoming difficulties. The venue was dressed in festive attire, and the newly announced Youth League flag fluttered in the May breeze. The young generation sitting around on the grass was full of joy. In particular, when the chairman of the conference announced the complete liberation of Hainan Island, the entire venue immediately boiled over, applause and cheers resounded through the sky, and the band played lively melodies such as "We Fought Well." The conference concluded with entertainment programs. On the 4th, Shanghai youth also carried out various commemorative activities in different districts, and 39 middle schools held grand sports meets. All newspapers published special "May Fourth" supplements and published editorials commemorating "May Fourth." The Shanghai People's Broadcasting Station held an airborne forum commemorating "May Fourth."
