The CCP Tianjin Municipal Committee Propaganda Department Instruction:
    Strengthen Propaganda and Mobilization Work in Factories
    Central Task is to Serve Economic Construction
    [Tianjin News] Tianjin Daily News: The Tianjin Municipal Committee Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China recently issued instructions to strengthen propaganda work in factories. After making a specific analysis of the ideological situation of the masses in public and private factories, it emphasized: The central task of propaganda work is to serve economic construction. In order to better cooperate with the current measures to overcome difficulties and develop production, and to enable propaganda work to play a better role in economic construction, propaganda work in factories must be strengthened. Over the past year or so, we have done some work in this regard. In particular, after the General Trade Union and the enterprise Party committee clearly stipulated that all work must be oriented towards production, propaganda work in factories has achieved some results. But generally speaking, in the past we emphasized political propaganda and neglected production propaganda. Political propaganda has played a great role in raising the consciousness of workers, greatly changing the labor attitude of workers, which was very necessary in the previous period and should continue in the future; however, insufficient propaganda deep within the production sector is a major shortcoming in our current work. As the political consciousness of workers gradually increases, general political propaganda can no longer meet their requirements, especially it cannot solve various specific problems in production. Therefore, to strengthen propaganda work in factories, we must first further clarify that production is the center, and then conduct planned propaganda and mobilization work according to the different situations of public and private enterprises and various units, and the ideological situation of the masses:
    1. In private enterprises, the current propaganda work should focus on labor-capital cooperation to overcome difficulties. Point out the nature of the current temporary difficulties and the various favorable conditions for overcoming them. Explain that private capital is not without a way out, but has a wide range of activities. To overcome the current difficulties, it is necessary to resolutely implement the policy of mutual benefit for both labor and capital. Workers should endure temporary pain with a spirit of self-restraint to maintain production; capitalists should strengthen their confidence and conscientiously take out capital and strength to maintain their own businesses. Together, we will get through this difficult period and prepare to welcome the arrival of better conditions.
    2. In state-owned enterprises, the main task of propaganda work is to encourage the labor enthusiasm of workers and the initiative and sense of responsibility of staff and technicians, and to clarify the direction and requirements of the production movement. Propaganda work should be closely combined with the production movement, timely disseminate new technical improvements and working methods, commend model figures and model deeds, listen to and reflect the masses' opinions on production and management systems, promote rationalization proposals and democratic management, so that production continues to advance and consolidate. In addition, it is necessary to educate all employees to strengthen the unity of employees through the production movement; educate Party members and Youth League members to establish a good mass viewpoint, improve their work style, and improve the relationship between the Party and the masses in the production movement.
    3. Due to the temporary difficulties encountered by some industrial and commercial enterprises, shutdowns and career changes are inevitable; therefore, it is absolutely necessary to provide relief to unemployed workers within a possible range. Providing relief to unemployed workers not only ensures the lives of unemployed workers, but also serves the development of industry and commerce, enabling capitalists to gain the understanding of workers when they have to dismiss workers, avoiding difficulties for both parties during dismissal, and thus eliminating the concerns of capitalists in hiring, which will better pave the way for the development of industry and commerce. It is necessary to call on all workers and industrialists and businessmen in the city to work together under the leadership of the government to do this work well.
    In order to effectively strengthen propaganda work in factories and achieve the above tasks, the instructions put forward the following points that should be paid attention to in the organizational form and methods of propaganda work in factories:
    1. Strengthen the role of the leading organization for propaganda work: The enterprise Party committee decided at the end of March this year to organize a propaganda and education committee with the Party as the core and with the participation of the government, trade unions, and the Youth League in factories and enterprises with independent production, as the leading organization for propaganda work in each factory. This is an organizational form in which the propaganda departments of the Party, government, trade unions, and the Youth League combine their specific circumstances under the instructions of the higher authorities to unify their steps and unify their strength, but some units' propaganda and education committees have not yet fully fulfilled the task of uniformly grasping the direction, plan, and steps of propaganda work, and must be seriously strengthened in the future.
    2. Pilot factory propaganda teams: In order to make propaganda and mobilization work penetrate into workshops and into the masses, the propaganda team being piloted by the No. 3 Textile Factory is a very good organization, and various factories and enterprises can imitate and pilot it. The propaganda team should be directly led by the trade union's cultural and educational department. Its main tasks are: (1) to convey the production calls and plans of the higher authorities and carry out production mobilization; (2) to report new production events in a timely manner and disseminate advanced technologies and working methods; (3) to listen to and reflect the requirements and voices of the surrounding masses, and answer questions raised by the masses; (4) to carry out daily current affairs political propaganda and mobilization work.
    3. Run the second-level trade unions and factory newspapers well: At present, all second-level trade unions and larger production units publish newspapers, which should be rectified and improved. Each newspaper should strengthen its connection with the masses, connect with reality, and launch criticism and self-criticism. The responsible cadres of units publishing newspapers should personally lead the work so that the newspaper becomes a powerful tool for guiding work and guiding the thinking of the masses. The form of the newspaper must be as popular and easy to understand as possible. At present, some newspapers have a phenomenon of imitating major newspapers, which should be corrected immediately. The blackboard newspapers and wall newspapers in various factories have generally achieved great results, which should be summarized and improved one step further. At the same time, the work of the communication stations in various factories should continue to be strengthened; and we can select key points to pilot reading groups, organize workers to read newspapers, and promote them after gaining experience.
    4. Strengthen propaganda work in private factories: Propaganda work in private factories was only carried out through the branch in the past, and the cooperation between the Party and the trade union should be strengthened in the future, and the propaganda and education work of the trade union should also take care of private factories. For the propaganda and education of capitalists, the economic departments and various districts should hold symposiums for capitalists in a planned way outside the factory; inside the factory, the trade union should actively promote consultation meetings to jointly discuss ways to overcome difficulties and develop production.
    5. Improve employee broadcasting: Broadcasting is a very effective propaganda tool, which is most easily accepted by the masses of workers, and is not as restricted by culture as written propaganda. Employee broadcasting should be persisted in, and the content of programs should be improved and refined. The broadcasting time does not need to be very long, the important thing is to make it possible for more workers to hear it, and to guide production and educate workers more. In addition to the existing communication network, a listening network should be established in a planned way.
    6. Improve factory cultural and recreational activities: Emphasis should be placed on serving production, adopting various short, concise, lively and vivid forms to reflect good deeds in production and criticize bad ones. The leading departments of literary and artistic work should pay attention to cultivating workers' own literary and artistic activities, organize and consolidate factory literary and artistic organizations, strengthen their regular guidance, and overcome the phenomena of intermittent breaks in the development of factory literary and artistic activities in the past.

　　中共天津市委宣传部指示
    加强工厂宣传鼓动工作   
    中心任务是为经济建设服务
    【天津讯】天津日报消息：中共天津市委宣传部为加强工厂宣传工作，日前发出指示，对当前公私营工厂的群众思想情况做了具体分析之后，着重指出：宣传工作的中心任务是为经济建设服务。为着更好地配合当前克服困难、发展生产的各种措施，使宣传工作在经济建设中更好地发挥作用，工厂中的宣传工作必须加强。一年多来在这一方面我们曾做了一些工作，特别是总工会和企业党委明确规定一切工作均须面向生产后，工厂中的宣传工作已获得若干成绩。但总的说来，过去我们是重政治宣传而轻生产宣传。政治宣传在提高工人觉悟上曾起了很大的作用，使工人的劳动态度大为改变，这在前一时期是很必要的，今后也还应继续进行；可是，深入生产内部的宣传不足，却是我们当前工作中的一个大缺点。在工人政治觉悟逐渐提高的情况下，一般性的政治宣传已不能满足他们的要求，尤其不能解决生产中的各项具体问题。因此，加强工厂宣传工作首先必须进一步明确以生产为中心，然后根据公、私营企业及各单位的不同情况和群众的思想情况，有计划地进行宣传鼓动工作：
    一、在私营企业内，当前的宣传工作应以劳资协力渡过困难为中心。指出目前暂时困难的性质及克服困难的各项有利条件。说明私人资本不是没有出路，而是有广大的活动范围的。渡过目前困难须坚决贯彻劳资两利政策。工人要以克己精神忍受暂时痛苦，以维持生产；资本家要坚定信心，认真拿出资本和力量来维持自己的事业。共同熬过这一段困难，准备迎接好转情况的到来。
    二、在公营企业内，宣传工作主要是鼓舞工人的劳动热情和职员、技术员的积极性与责任心，明确生产运动的方向和要求。宣传工作应与生产运动紧密结合，及时传播新的技术改进与工作方法，表扬模范人物与模范事迹，倾听和反映群众对生产及管理制度的意见，推广合理化建议与民主管理，使生产不断前进和巩固。此外，并应教育全体职工，通过生产运动加强职工团结；教育党员团员，在生产运动中树立良好的群众观点，改善作风，搞好党群关系。
    三、由于部分工商业遭遇暂时困难，停工和转业就不可避免；因此，在可能范围内救济失业工人是完全必要的。救济失业工人，不但使失业工人生活有保障，而且也是为了工商业的发展，使资方在必须解雇工人时能够获得工人的谅解，免除解雇时双方的困难，也就可以消除资方在雇佣时的顾虑，这样就给工商业的发展更好地铲平了道路。要号召全市工人和工商业家，在政府领导下共同来做好这一工作。
    为了有效地加强工厂宣传工作，实现上述任务，指示中提出了工厂宣传工作的组织形式和方法方式上应注意的事项：
    一、加强宣传工作领导机构的作用：企业党委本年三月底已决定在独立生产的工厂企业中，组织以党为核心，政、工、团参加的宣教委员会，为各厂宣传工作的领导机构。这是党、政、工、团宣传部门在上级指示下结合本单位具体情况统一步调，齐一力量的组织形式，但有的单位宣教委员会尚未很好尽到统一掌握宣传工作方针、计划及步骤的任务，今后必须认真加强。
    二、试办工厂宣传队：为使宣传鼓动工作深入车间，深入群众，中纺三厂正在试办中的宣传队是一个很好的组织，各工厂、企业可以仿照试办。宣传队应由工会文教部门直接领导。它的主要任务是：（１）传达上级的生产号召和计划，进行生产动员；（２）及时报道生产的新事件，传播先进技术与工作方法；（３）倾听和反映周围群众的要求和呼声，解答群众所提出的问题；（４）进行日常的时事政治宣传鼓动工作。
    三、办好二级工会及各厂报纸：目前各二级工会及较大生产单位均出版报纸，应加以整顿改进。各个报纸应加强联系群众，联系实际，展开批评自我批评。出版报纸的单位之负责干部应亲自领导，使报纸成为指导工作、指导群众思想的有力工具。报纸的形式须力求通俗易解。目前有的报纸有模仿大报的现象，应即改正。各厂的黑板报、壁报一般的都获得很大成效，应加以总结，提高一步。同时各厂通讯站的工作，应继续加强；并可选择重点，试办读报小组，组织工人读报，获得经验后再行推广。
    四、加强私营工厂宣传工作：私营工厂宣传工作过去仅通过支部进行，今后应加强党与工会的配合，工会宣教工作亦应照顾到私营工厂。对资本家的宣传教育，厂外由经济部门及各区有计划地召开资本家座谈会；厂内由工会主动地推动协商会，共同讨论渡过困难及发展生产的办法。
    五、改进职工广播：广播是一个很有效的宣传工具，它最易为工人群众所接受，而不像文字宣传那样须受文化的限制。职工广播应该坚持下来，并改进内容精炼节目。广播时间不须很长，重要的是尽可能使更多的工人能够听到，更多的指导生产与教育工人。除现有的通讯网外，并应有计划地建立收听网。
    六、改善工厂文娱活动：应强调为生产服务，采取各种短小精悍生动活泼的形式，反映生产中好的事迹与批评坏的。文艺工作领导部门应注意培养工人自己的文艺活动，组织并巩固工厂文艺组织，加强对他们的经常指导，克服过去开展工厂文艺活动的忽冷忽热不时中断等现象。
