　　On the Issue of Tax Payment for Military Production
    Answers from the Ministry of Finance and the State Taxation Administration to Readers
Editor:
    Since the military has engaged in production, we have encountered many difficulties regarding tax payment due to our lack of understanding of tax regulations. We now raise the following questions and request that you inquire with the relevant departments and provide answers in the People's Forum.
    1. If we organize military labor to contract highway repairs, receiving wages based on cubic meters of earthwork, should we pay income tax on this?
    2. To solve the problem of agricultural production tools for our unit, we have transferred military personnel to establish iron and woodworking factories, and hired individual workers for technical guidance. Should these factories pay taxes? Which taxes should they pay?
    3. We are using an old kiln from a certain mine to organize military labor and hire some technical workers to burn bricks for the mine. We receive wages for our labor. Should we pay taxes on this? If so, should the mine pay the taxes or should we?

Comrade Ding Ke:
    Your questions have been answered by the Ministry of Finance and the State Taxation Administration of the Central People's Government as follows:
    1. Organizing military labor to contract highway repairs, receiving wages based on cubic meters of earthwork, does not require income tax if there is no commercial nature and it is merely a combination of labor.
    2. If iron and woodworking factories are established to solve the problem of military production tools and the factories do not engage in external business or calculate profit and loss, there is no need to pay taxes. Otherwise, industrial and commercial tax (including business tax and income tax) should be levied. Stamp tax should also be paid for account books and documents, and temporary business tax should be paid when selling goods to other places.
    3. If the military is only providing labor for the mine's brick burning and the bricks are still sold by the original kiln owner, then all taxes payable should be borne by the original kiln owner.

　　Two Suggestions
    (I) Editor:
    On the Langfang to Wanzhuang section of the Beijing-Tianjin Railway, women and children often pick at railway ties with knives and small hoes under the guise of collecting firewood. This causes serious damage to national property. Sometimes they also surround workers who are replacing ties and搶(qiang - steal) the wood, affecting the workers' work. It is hoped that the Wanzhuang Public Security Police Station and the local government will immediately stop this and educate and help these people engage in other production.

    (II)
    Some newly planted telephone poles along the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway are not very strong. In the Datong, Tianzhen, and Yanggao areas east of Datong, many telephone poles beside the railway have been blown down by strong winds. If they are not repaired quickly, the poles will fall and the lines will break, disrupting telephone communication and hindering transportation. It is hoped that the relevant departments will send people to repair them quickly.

### 关于部队生产纳税问题  财政部税务总局答读者问

　　关于部队生产纳税问题
    财政部税务总局答读者问编辑同志：
    自部队参加生产以来，由于我们对税则不够了解，所以在纳税问题上发生很多困难，现提出以下几个问题，请代询有关部门，并在人民园地给予答复。
    一、以部队劳动力组织起来包修公路，按土方得工资米，这样是否应纳所得税？
    二、为解决本部队农业生产工具，抽调部队人员建立铁、木工厂，并雇请个别工人作技术指导，这些工厂是否应纳税？应纳那些税？
    三、利用某矿厂旧窑，组织部队劳动力并雇请一部技术工人代该矿厂烧砖，我们以自己劳动力获得工资，这样是否应纳税？如纳税，应由该矿厂纳税呢还是由我们纳税？
                                    六十八军生产合作分社  丁克丁克同志：
    你们的问题，已请中央人民政府财政部税务总局答复如下：
    一、组织部队劳动力包修公路，按土方得工资米，如果没有商业性质，只是劳动力的组合，不纳所得税。
    二、为解决部队生产工具，抽调部队人员建立铁木工厂，如果该工厂不对外营业，不做损益计算，是不需纳税的，否则就要征工商业税（包括营业税及所得税）。帐簿单据亦需要完纳印花税，如果向外埠销售货物时，还须完纳临时营业税。
    三、部队为矿窑烧砖，仅系供给劳动力，砖仍由原窑主出售时，所有应纳税款，自应由原窑主负担。

  　建议二则
    （一）编辑同志：
    京津路廊坊至万庄段常有妇女小孩以拾柴为名，在铁路上用小刀小镐劈道木。使国家财富受到严重损失。有时他们还围着换道木的工人抢木头，影响工人们工作。希望万庄公安派出所及当地政府即予制止，并教育、帮助这些人从事其他生产。
                中共河北省安次县委会研究员  李勃升
    （二）
    京绥路上有些新栽的电话杆不很坚固。在大同以东，天镇、阳高一带，铁路旁有很多电话杆被大风刮得东倒西歪，如不速加整理，就会杆倒线断，而使电话通讯中断，交通受到阻碍。希望有关部门，速派人修理。
