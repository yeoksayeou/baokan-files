　　Young Model Military Family Member Yang Shuqin
　　Gao Jie Wang Derui
    Yang Shuqin, a model military family member from Nanlingshan Village, Mancheng County, Hebei Province, is active in production. Her hoeing and manure delivery are no weaker than men's. She is frugal in her daily life, has a proper demeanor, and is ideologically progressive. Everyone in the village praises her. Everyone says: "Shuqin is truly worthy of being called a model military family member."

    Shuqin is a liberated peasant woman, twenty-three years old this year, and her maiden home is in Yangjiazuo Village, District One of Mancheng. Her family was very poor from childhood. At the age of fifteen, she participated in land production, hoeing, plowing, harrowing, delivering manure… she can do it all. In December 1944 (at the age of seventeen), she married Jiang Wanjun from Nanlingshan Village in this district. Her husband's family was also not well-off. The whole family of eight, including the nine mu given by the farmers' association, only cultivated sixteen mu of land. They lived in only one small flat house. More than half a year after the marriage, her husband joined the army. Although she was not old, she understood revolutionary principles very well. She always thought: If no one joins the army, how can the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang reactionaries be defeated? She believes that joining the army is glorious. In 1947, when the family was divided, she was given six mu of land. Because there was no house, she borrowed to live in Zhao Luo's house. Li Luozhen said: "There are not many such women in that village." In 1949, the village gave her four large stone slab houses and two mu of good land in the west of the village. After Shuqin moved into the new house, she felt much brighter. She said to others: "If there were no Communist Party and Eighth Route Army, how could we have been liberated?" From then on, she became even more enthusiastic about production.

    Shuqin is really an expert in production. Throughout the year, except for plowing and sowing which require help, she relies on herself for plowing, harrowing, hoeing, weeding, transporting soil, delivering manure, weaving cloth and making clothes; with the help of her sister Gui Fen from her maiden family taking care of the children and cooking, she goes to the field every day to produce and never relies on substitute labor. This year, the one and a half mu of cotton field in the west of the village was plowed, harrowed and weeded by herself. When the work is really too busy, she asks her brothers from her maiden family to help. Before dawn, she goes to hoe seedlings. After throwing away the bowls after the meal, she goes to the field again and does not return home until the sun sets. She works very fast. She can hoe one and a half mu every day in the first round, no slower than a man. Every year, the crops are hoeed three times, and the field is weeded very cleanly. Teacher Zhang Jingming said: "Her crops grow well." A piece of land near the mountain is far from her home. During the autumn harvest, she drove livestock to carry the crops, a round trip of ten li. She could drive five times a day, and the grain was carried home by her one bag after another (small bags). She is even more capable of transporting soil and manure, always driving two animals by herself. This spring, she transported sixty-five loads of soil in five days, splitting trenches, loading and unloading burdens, all by herself. The one and a half mu of cotton field in the west of the village, more than one li away from the village, was delivered with more than thirty loads of manure in one day, and it was spread in half a day. Zhang Luogang's wife said: "Wanjun's daughter-in-law is really capable, other women should learn from her."

    She not only cultivates the crops in the field well, but also plans the work at home carefully. Last winter and this spring, she spun twelve jin of thread and wove eighteen zhang and five chi of cloth. In addition to her own use, she also made cotton clothes for the four members of her maiden family (because her parents died early, leaving only two brothers and two sisters). In order to accumulate more fertilizer and increase income, she raises a pig every year. In February 1947, she exchanged one and a half jin of thread for a small pig weighing five jin, and sold it for one shi of rice on August 17. Last year, she bought a six-jin pig, which now weighs more than fifty jin. In addition, the eggs laid by four hens are enough to exchange for oil, salt, and cloth dyeing. She said: "Don't underestimate my chickens, they are very useful." Old farmer Zhao Hengji praised her, saying: "Don't look at her (referring to Shuqin) being young, she plans her life well."

    Because she is active in production and labor, the crop harvest the year before last was good. The three mu of corn south of the village yielded two shi and four (which is considered a good crop considering the soil quality of the village), and the family had enough to eat and drink. Although the harvest was poor last year due to flooding, the government took care of her with a total of ninety jin of grain in three times. Because she is frugal (adding more vegetables, not spilling rice and flour) and practices strict economy, she has overcome various difficulties. Last spring, the villagers elected her as a model military family member, and in the autumn, they elected her as a labor model to attend the district, and she was commended at every meeting of martyrs', military, and workers' families. Everyone knows that she only used two man-days from the village last year. She often thinks this way: When I am busy, others are also busy, and I should do everything I can do myself! Under her influence, other military families have also actively participated in production. For example, the military family member Zhang Luochang, who was determined to need twenty man-days last year, only used four man-days. The family of Gan Zhang Mo Chi, who was determined to need twenty-five man-days this year, also plans to do more work themselves and use as little labor as possible. This year, when assessing labor, everyone assessed Shuqin with thirty animal-days and twenty-five man-days (actually only equivalent to eight or nine man-days, because the embankment washed away by rain had to be repaired immediately with sixteen or seventeen man-days). She said that she would try to use as little or no labor as possible. In this way, all twenty-seven households of martyrs', military, and workers' families in the village, and the eighteen households receiving substitute cultivation (including four households receiving full substitute cultivation) only needed one hundred and eighty man-days and seventy animal-days, and all planned to actively produce themselves.

    Shuqin is not only good at production and labor, but also very progressive in her thinking. When the "one bowl of rice per household" campaign was launched last autumn (for disaster relief), although her family was very difficult, she still took out two bowls of rice and four jin of yam leaves. This year, she originally planned to plant only one and a half mu of cotton, but after hearing the government's call to plant more cotton, she immediately borrowed nineteen jin of cotton seeds from Yangjiazuo Village and planted an additional one and a third mu, leaving one and two-tenths mu to plant yams. After planting on April 28, it was covered with soil due to heavy rain on May 1. So, she went to the field the next day to pull up the cotton, and she pulled up the two mu of cotton five li away in the west of the village in half a day. Now the seedlings have come out. She plans to plant the crops well this year, pick more flowers for cotton, and ensure that other crops are hoeed three times. In order to make her husband feel at ease in the front (now in Yunnan Province), she often asks the village teacher to write to him, saying: "The village cadres take good care of us, and life at home is not difficult, so don't worry." Her husband replied and asked her to work hard in production, improve her own life, and take time to study culture. She kept these words in mind and planned to participate in noon school this year to improve her education.

　　青年模范军属杨淑琴
　　高杰　王德瑞
    河北省满城县南陵山村模范军属杨淑琴，生产积极，锄地送粪不弱于男子，平日省吃俭用，作风正派，思想进步，村里的人念叨起来没有不夸奖她的。大家都说：“淑琴真称得起模范军属”。
    淑琴是个翻身的农民妇女，今年二十三岁，娘家在满城一区杨家佐村。自幼家中很贫苦，十五岁就参加了土地生产，锄地、串地、耙地、运粪，……她都能干。一九四四年（十七岁时）十二月她与本区南陵山村蒋万君结了婚。婆家光景也不强，全家八口人，连农会给的九亩在内，也只种十六亩地。住的只有一间小平房。结婚半年多，男人就参了军。她年岁虽不大，却很懂得革命道理。她总是想着：如果谁都不去参军，日本鬼子和国民党反动派怎么能打倒？她认为参军是光荣的。一九四七年分家时分了六亩地，因为没有房子，就在赵洛婆家借住。李洛振说：“这样妇女那村也不多。”一九四九年村中给了她四间大石板房，还有村西的二亩好地。淑琴搬到新房后，觉得豁亮多了。她对别人说：“要是没有共产党八路军，我们怎么会翻身呢？”从此对生产就更起劲了。
    淑琴在生产上也真内行，一年当中，除了耕耩要请人帮助以外，无论串、耙、耠、锄、驮土、运粪、织布做衣裳，都靠自己；由娘家的妹子桂芬帮着看孩子、做饭，她每天下地生产，从不依赖代耕。今年村西的一亩半棉地就是她自己耠、耙、擦的。活实在太忙的时候，就找她娘家的兄弟来帮帮忙。天还不大亮，自己就去锄苗，饭后把碗一扔，又到地里去了，等到太阳落山才回家。她干活很快，头遍每天能耪一亩半，一点也不比男子慢，每年庄稼准锄三遍，地里耪的也很干净。教员张景明说：“她什么庄稼长的都不错。”靠山边的一块地离她家很远，秋收时赶牲口驮庄稼，来回一趟整十里，一天能赶五次，打的粮食也由她一口袋一口袋（小口袋）的往家背。她驮土运粪更能干，一个人总是赶两个牲口。今年春天，五天内她赶土六十五驮，劈堑、装卸驮子，完全靠自己。村西的一亩半棉地，离村一里多，一天送去三十多驮粪，半天就撒开了。张洛刚老婆说：“万君媳妇真能干，别的妇女应当向她学。”
    她不仅地里的庄稼刨种的好，家里的活也打算的周到。去冬今春她纺了十二斤线，织了十八丈五尺布。除自己家用外，还给她娘家的四口人做了棉衣（因父母早死，只剩两个兄弟两个妹妹）。为了多积肥和增加收入，年年喂一口猪。一九四七年二月用一斤半线换了一口五斤重的小猪，喂到八月十七，卖了一石米。去年买了个六斤的，现在又有五十多斤了。另外四只母鸡下的蛋够换油盐和染布染线。他说：“别小看我这几只鸡，可顶大用呢。”老农赵恒吉夸她说：“别看人家（指淑琴）年纪不大，过日子可有计划。”
    由于她生产劳动积极，前年的庄稼收成好，光是村南的三亩棒子就打了两石四（按该村土质，算是不错的庄稼了），家中达到了够吃够喝。去年虽然受了涝，打的粮食很少。但政府三次共照顾了她九十斤粮食。因她省吃俭用（多搀些菜、不泼米撒面），厉行节约，克服了各种困难。去年春天，全村群众选她为模范军属，秋后又选她为出席区的劳动模范，在每次烈、军、工属的会议上都受到表扬。谁都知道，她去年全年只用了村里两个人工。她常这样想：我忙的时候人家也忙，凡能自己干的就该亲自下手干！在她影响下，其他军属也都积极参加生产了。如军属张洛常，去年确定要二十个人工，但只用了四个工。干属张墨池家今年确定二十五个人工，也计划自己多干，尽量少用工。今年评工时，大家给淑琴评了三十个牲口工，二十五个人工（实际上只合八、九个人工，因为雨水冲毁的地埝，马上就得用十六、七个人工进行修理。）她说尽量作到少使或不使。这样，全村共二十七户烈、军、工属，受代耕的十八户（内有四户全部代耕）才要了一百八十个人工、七十个牲口工，都计划着自己积极生产。
    淑琴不光生产劳动好，思想也很进步。在去年秋后开展每户一碗米运动时（救灾用），她虽然家中很困难，还拿了两碗米，并拿了四斤山药叶。今年她本来打算只种一亩半棉花，可是听到政府多种棉花的号召后，马上到杨家佐村去借来十九斤棉籽，又多种了一亩三分，剩下一亩二分地栽了山药。四月二十八号种上后，五月一号因下了大雨，被土压住了，她就在第二天上地里扒棉花，村西五里远的二亩棉，她半天一晌就扒完了，现在苗已经出来了。她计划今年一定把庄稼种好，对棉花作到多摘花，其他作物保证锄三遍。为了使男人在前方（现在云南省）安心工作，常常找村上的教员给他写信说：“村中干部照顾的好，家中生活不遭难，不要挂念”，她男人回信就叫她好好生产，改善自己的生活，并要抽空学习文化。这些话她都记在心里，计划今年参加午校学习，提高自己的文化。
