    【Taiyuan News】According to Shanxi Daily news: The cotton planting movement in the Yuncheng and Linfen special districts of Shanxi Province has been fully launched, and one million mu of cotton fields have been sown. After rainfall in various places on April 15, the Yuncheng and Linfen District Party Committees and Administrative Offices immediately took cotton planting as their top priority, organizing cadres to go to the countryside to promote it vigorously. An’yi, Xinjiang and other counties in the Yuncheng Special District, and Linfen, Quwo and other counties in the Linfen Special District also promptly organized forces to go to the countryside to specifically organize and promote it. At the same time, in the promotion process, they generally paid attention to publicizing and explaining policies, and solving specific difficulties and problems in cotton planting, thus making the cotton planting movement develop more vigorously. According to statistics, the cotton planting work in various counties of the Yuncheng Special District has been more than half sown in most areas. Out of the planned 1.1 million mu of cotton fields in the entire district, 800,000 mu had been sown by April 22. In the Linfen Special District, out of the planned 538,000 mu of cotton, 200,000 mu had been sown. For example, in An’yi's Xiliu, Xinjiang's Dongbi, and Ruicheng's Diantou villages in Yuncheng Special District, a total of 3,552 mu were sown, completing 90% of the original plan. Quwo County has sown 70% to 90% of its fields. In the Linfen Special District, Xiangling has sown more than half, and Xizhang Village in Linfen's Fourth District has sown two-thirds of its original plan.

    This year, various places have paid more attention to and improved cotton planting techniques and the promotion of superior seeds. For example, in the Linfen Special District, in order to focus on promoting superior seeds, 500,000 jin of Si character cotton seeds were lent to various counties. Fushan and Hongdong exchanged seeds between districts. Huo County also specially printed small booklets on cotton planting techniques to guide cotton farmers in cotton planting. In Quwo County of the special district, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of cotton land in the past was one to two cartloads, but this year it has increased to two to three cartloads. In Xiangling, in areas where conditions permit, cotton fields are plowed three times and harrowed three times. In the cotton fields of various places in the Yuncheng Special District, plowing was generally done two to three times. In An’yi’s Dongliu Village, 192.5 mu received four cartloads of manure per mu, 59.8 mu received three cartloads, 63.5 mu received two cartloads, and 38 mu received no manure. During sowing, reasonable fertilization was also advocated to increase fertilizer efficiency, such as Liu Bingxue’s method of only using "nest fertilizer" (where the seeds are, the fertilizer goes). Those who have not applied fertilizer continue to mobilize for fertilizer accumulation, preparing to apply topdressing fertilizer to remedy the situation.

    However, according to the report of the Yuncheng Special District inspection team, in the current continuation of completing the expansion of the cotton field plan, the original plans in some areas are unrealistic, which has caused the plans to fall through. Only areas with a better working foundation have exceeded and completed their tasks. General villages and backward villages are still far from completing their plans. Therefore, on April 22, the District Party Committee telegraphed all counties to overcome complacency and slack thinking, further conduct in-depth inspections and mobilization, face general villages, face backward villages, absorb the experience of villages that have completed their plans, and launch a blitz on backward villages. District Party Committee members Yan Jiade and Wei Zuomin, and Deputy Commissioner Liang Xuanxian, also personally led 14 cadres to go to Jie County, Yi County, An’yi, and Yuxiang to inspect and urge the completion of cotton sowing work.

　　山西运城临汾两专区
　　播种棉田百万亩
　　改良技术推广优种有进步
    【太原讯】据山西日报消息：山西运城、临汾专区植棉运动全面展开，百万亩棉田已经下种。四月十五日各地落雨后，运城、临汾两专区地委、专署，即以植棉为头等任务，分别组织干部下乡进行有力推动。运城专区之安邑、新绛等县，临汾专区之临汾、曲沃等县也及时地组织力量下乡具体组织推动。同时在推动中，一般注意了宣传解释政策，与解决植棉中具体困难问题，因而使植棉运动比较有力展开。据统计，运城专区各县植棉工作，大部地区下种过半，全区一百一十万余亩植棉计划，至四月二十二日已播种八十万亩。临汾专区计划植棉五十三万八千余亩，已下种二十万亩。如运城专区之安邑的西柳，新绛的东璧，芮城的店头等三村，共下种三千五百五十二亩，已完成原计划的百分之九十。曲沃全县已播种百分之七十至九十。临汾专区之襄陵已播种过半，临汾四区之西张村已播种原计划的三分之二。
    今年各地对植棉技术、推广优种上，多有所注意和提高。如临汾专区为有重点推广优种，贷给各县斯字棉籽五十万斤。浮山、洪洞都做了区与区互相调换。霍县并专印了植棉技术小册子，指导棉农植棉。该专区之曲沃过去植棉每亩上肥一车到两车，今年增至两车到三车。襄陵在有条件地区，棉地做到犁三、耙三。运城专区各地棉田，一般的做到犁二遍至三遍。安邑东柳村每亩上四车粪的一百九十二亩半，三车粪的五十九亩八分，两车粪的六十三亩半，没上粪的三十八亩。下种中并提倡合理施肥，增加肥效，如刘丙学只采用“上窝粪”办法（籽到那里粪到那里）。没上粪的继续发动积肥，准备上追肥补救。
    但根据运城专区之检查组报告，目前在继续完成扩大棉田计划中，由于某些地区原计划不实际，因之使计划落空。超过和完成任务的，仅是部分工作基础较好地区，一般村和落后村，距完成计划尚差。因之，该区地委于四月二十二日特电告各县，克服麻痹、松懈思想，进一步深入检查发动，面向一般村，面向落后村，吸取已完成计划村经验，突击落后村。地委阎家德、卫佐民，副专员梁选贤并又亲自带领干部十四人，分赴解县、猗氏、安邑、虞乡检查督促完成棉花播种工作。
