Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th - TASS dispatch: Zhukov, the Paris correspondent of *Pravda*, recently wrote a commentary on the French-West German joint management plan for the coal mining and steel industries, stating: In essence, the plan promoted by Schuman is not new at all. Although Schuman insists that this issue is completely unrelated to the restoration of the pre-war European steel cartel, in fact, Schuman's proposal is guided in many respects by the same idea. This idea dominated the governments of France and Germany in the 1920s when they greatly facilitated the formation of this cartel.

　　At that time, just like now, the problem also lay in the establishment of a powerful organization of arms tycoons, capable of manipulating the world market and suppressing its competitors (first and foremost, the British coal and steel owners). However, the situation then was completely different from now. At that time, the French monopoly capitalists and the Ruhr magnates concluded temporary secret agreements, and manufacturers from Belgium and Luxembourg were also involved. At that time, they were still seeking their own interests; but now, whether the former or the latter, to a considerable extent, have had to reconcile themselves to the unenviable position of being third-rate—American imperialist traveling salesmen. American imperialists rule enslaved Western Europe as if it were their own home. This time, the enormous Franco-German industrial trust is not being established within the scope of a private cartel, but according to an agreement between governments that are subservient to Washington. This situation merely proves once again to what extent this dependence has reached. According to newspapers, industrial figures in Paris and London see two aspects of Schuman's proposal: first, this is the usual attempt to intensify the "Cold War" and establish a strong, unified body to supply the "Atlantic armies" and their "offensive corps"—West Germany—with new weapons, thereby preparing for a real war. Second, people can easily see that this plan's spearhead is directed against Britain. Although, formally, all countries are invited to participate in the coal and iron industry association, the drafters of the plan prefer to bypass British industrialists. One characteristic thing is that Schuman's proposal, which was welcomed with great praise by the puppet Bonn "Chancellor" Adenauer, was not agreed to by the British in advance, and was not even notified to them before it was put forward.

　　Zhukov, after pointing out that the French proposal has been included in the agenda of the US, British and French foreign ministers' meeting in London, stated: No matter what changes there may be in the negotiations on this issue, French democrats understand that they must greatly heighten their vigilance against these plans. The French people know the fact that these plans are formulated by American imperialists in order to try to consolidate the position of the Ruhr magnates under their wings, and they regard the Ruhr as their main arsenal in Europe. France is only assigned the role of an auxiliary workshop in this arsenal, but even West Germany itself will not become the master of this giant Franco-German industrial trust: the master of this trust is the head of Chase Bank and the American steel tycoons of US Steel, who had already become involved in the Ruhr as early as July 1948, and are everywhere filled with their henchmen hired from die-hard Hitlerites.

　　Zhukov concluded: The broad masses of France and West Germany are protesting with increasing strength and ingenuity against the American plans to turn their countries into springboards for aggression and turn the people of both countries into cannon fodder.

### 朱可夫揭露舒曼丑态　指出卖国计划是受美帝指使　敦促法国进步人民提高警惕

　　朱可夫揭露舒曼丑态
　　指出卖国计划是受美帝指使   
    敦促法国进步人民提高警惕
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：真理报驻巴黎记者朱可夫顷著文评论法国与西德联合经营煤矿工业与炼钢工业的计划称：从本质上说，舒曼所标揭的计划，一点都不新奇，虽然舒曼坚称这一问题与恢复战前欧洲大陆的炼钢卡特尔完全无关，然而，事实上，舒曼的建议却是在许多方面都受到同一思想的指使。这种思想在二十年代当法德两国政府对这种卡特尔的组成大开方便之门时便曾支配过该两国的政府。
    那时，就像现在一样，问题也在于成立军火大王的强大组织，俾能操纵世界市场并压制其竞争者（首先是英国的煤钢所有者）。然而，那时的情况和现在完全不同。那时，法国的独占资本家和鲁尔的大亨们订定了临时密约，比利时和卢森堡的制造商也卷入其中，那时，他们还是寻求自己的利益；而现在，无论前者或后者，在相当的限度内，却都已不得不自安于居位第三——美帝国主义者巡回推销员的这种无可羡慕的地位了。美帝国主义者就像在自己的家里一样，统治着被奴役的西欧。这一次，庞大的法、德工业托辣斯，并不是在私人卡特尔的范围之内，而是根据对华盛顿唯命是从的政府之间的协定成立的，这种情况，只不过再度证明这种依存性已达到什么程度而已。根据报纸的说法，巴黎和伦敦的工业界人士看到了舒曼建议的两个方面：其一，这是加紧“冷战”的照例的尝试，并建立起一个强有力的统一机构，使之能供给“大西洋军队”及其“进攻兵团”——西德以新式武器，从而准备真刀真枪的战争。第二，人们毫不费力地可以看出这个计划反英的矛头。虽然从形式上说，所有的国家都被邀参加煤铁工业的联营，但是，该计划的起草人却宁愿撇开英国工业家行事。有一件可以表明其特点的事便是，受到傀儡波恩“总理”阿登纳以很大的赞美来欢迎的舒曼建议，并没有预先得到英国人的同意，甚至连通知他们都没有，便提出来了。
    朱可夫在指出法国的建议案已列入伦敦美、英、法三国外长会议议程之后称：无论关于这一问题的谈判将有什么变化，法国民主人士都懂得必须对这些计划大大地提高警惕。法国人民都知道一桩事实：就是，这些计划是美帝国主义者为了设法巩固他们卵翼下的鲁尔大亨的地位而制定的，他们将鲁尔看作他们在欧洲的主要兵工厂。法国只被分派充当这个兵工厂的一个辅助车间的角色而已，但即使是西德本身，也不会成为这个巨型的法德工业托辣斯的主人：这个托辣斯的主人是大通银行的大头子和美国钢铁公司的美国钢铁大王们，他们早在一九四八年七月就已染指鲁尔，并且到处布满了他们从死硬的希特勒分子中雇来的走狗。
    朱可夫末称：法国与西德的广大群众正以日益增长的力量与机智，抗议打算把他们的国家变成侵略的跳板，并把两国人民变成炮灰的美国计划。
