Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 29th – The first batch of cash management work for state organs in Tianjin has been progressing very smoothly since it began on the 16th of this month. As of the 24th, all 114 state-owned industrial and commercial enterprises and municipal industrial enterprises originally scheduled for the first batch of cash management have opened accounts at the Cash Management Department of the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank. In addition to retaining three days' worth of cash, all units are submitting all cash and bills to the People's Bank daily as required. At the same time, all transactions between units are using transfer notices. As of the 24th, the total amount transferred in and out between the units reached 1,207,188,187,000 yuan, saving a large amount of cash usage, thus playing a positive role in stabilizing current prices.
　　According to the cash management measures formulated by the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank, each unit should submit its three-day cash retention plan for the first ten days of each month to the bank for record. Currently, more than 60 units, including Xinhua Bookstore, have submitted the above plan to the bank. This has initially promoted the strengthening of business and financial planning by various enterprises. For example, the Tianjin Branch of China Textile Construction Company previously only had expenditure in its budget and no revenue, which has been corrected in the revenue and expenditure plan submitted to the Tianjin Branch of the People's Bank this time.

　　津现金管理顺利进行
    一百多单位在人民银行开户   
    转账一万余亿节约大量现金
    【新华社天津二十九日电】天津市国家机关首批现金管理工作，自本月十六日开始实施以来，进行甚为顺利。截至二十四日止，原定第一批受现金管理的国营工商业和市营工业共一百一十四个单位，已全部在人民银行天津分行现金管理部集中开户。各单位除留用三日现金外，均按照规定逐日将所有现金和票据送存人民银行。同时各单位间的交易，也一律使用转账通知书。到二十四日为止，各单位互相转入转出的金额共达一万二千零七十一亿八千一百八十七万元，节约了大批现金的使用，因而对目前物价的稳定起了良好的作用。
    按照人民银行天津分行所拟定的现金管理办法，各单位自六月份起每月前十日应将三天的留用现金计划，送交银行备查。现新华书店等六十余单位，已将上项计划送交该行。这样就初步促进了各企业单位加强对业务和财务的计划性。如中国纺织建设公司天津分公司，过去的预算只有付方而无收方，这在此次送交人民银行天津分行的收支计划内已经得到改正。
