　　From Opposition to Unity
    ——The Improvement of Party-Mass Relations at Yenching University
    Lin Shoujin, Secretary of the General Party Branch of Yenching University

    "In the past, I felt that Party and League members were just Party and League members, but now I feel that they are also classmates." This is what a student in the Faculty of Arts, who used to have an antagonistic attitude towards Party and League members, said after the General Branch of Yenching University began its efforts to improve Party-mass relations in the autumn of 1949. This sentence concisely illustrates one aspect of the change in Party-mass relations at Yenching University over the past six months.

    When school started last autumn, Party-mass relations at Yenching University were very poor. Party members lacked work experience and were only accustomed to underground work methods (all Party members in the school were new and had previously been underground). The tendency of closed-doorism was quite serious in the ideology of Party members: work did not start from the demands of the masses, or they only saw the backward side of the masses, and they always liked to take on everything themselves when they started working. At the same time, because they used to engage in vigorous student movements, they did not realize that the central task of Party and League members in schools after liberation was to study their regular courses well. Many Party and League members did not pay attention to their regular course studies, and their grades were very poor. In addition, most of the more than 500 new students (there were more than 900 students in the entire school at that time) came from newly liberated areas, and there were many problems in their understanding of the Party and the League. Therefore, the gap between Party members and the masses was even deeper. Some non-Party and League member students said, "I don't know what Party and League members are busy with all day long?" Some were afraid to speak in discussions, saying they were "afraid that Party and League members would investigate their thoughts." Most of the non-Party member students in the second year of the Mechanical Engineering Department were not very satisfied with the Party and League members. They did not welcome Party and League members to join their mutual aid groups. They deliberately said strange things to tease Party and League members when discussing political lessons. However, the Party and League members only felt that the students were backward and did not dare to adhere to principles. A student in the Department of Western Languages said, "You say you want to serve the students, but you don't know what services the students want you to provide, and how will you serve them?"

    With the help of the School Branch Section of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, the General Branch Committee recognized the erroneous thinking and bad work style of Party members in uniting the masses, re-studied and estimated the students' situation, and adopted the following specific measures to improve Party-mass relations.

    Party and League Work Oriented Towards Learning
    The first thing to do was to correct the bias of Party and League members in underestimating their regular course studies. In the first semester after liberation, because most Party and League members were accustomed to leading underground struggles, they thought that the work of Party and League members in schools was to engage in political movements and political studies, and did not pay attention to studying their regular courses well. After studying Comrade Jiang Nanxiang's report on "Carrying out New Democracy Studies" at the end of September last year, everyone's understanding began to change. At the same time, a study check was carried out during the semester to correct the biased attitudes and methods of study of Party and League members, and slogans such as "Studying regular courses well is the central task" were put forward, so that most Party members could play an exemplary role in study, and organize students to solve problems in learning. Except for the Department of Chemistry, the grades of all Party members in the school were above average. Party and League members also took the initiative to help professors and lecturers understand the students' demands and improve teaching methods. At the same time, they organized students to improve their study methods. For example, it used to take three to four hours to review a chapter of biology, but later, using the method of looking at pictures and asking each other questions, it only took one hour, and they still remembered it firmly.

    From then on, professors and students began to change their views on Party and League members, believing that Party and League members could still play a leading role in learning. However, Party and League members still had two wrong ideas about learning: one was that they did not understand that their most important task was to study their regular courses well and master scientific knowledge. They often opposed work and study, thinking that work was for the Party and study was for themselves, and that it didn't matter if their studies were poor as long as they did their work well. Some, although they realized that studying was a task assigned to them by the Party, did not have a deep understanding and were not strict with themselves, and their enthusiasm for learning was not high. Another problem was that they felt that there was nothing to learn from the old culture. Especially in the Faculties of Arts and Law, they would not critically accept useful things in the old culture, so they did not actively study it. At the same time, there was still a contradiction between work and study time. At this time, on the one hand, they studied documents and instructions to overcome erroneous ideas; on the other hand, they proposed specific measures to solve the contradiction between work and study time: 1. Party and League members holding Party and League positions must not hold concurrent positions; 2. Stipulate the number of meetings per month; 3. Streamline organizational structure and merge meeting levels. For example, in the past, the resolutions of the departmental committee (administrative organization) had to be discussed by the cadre meeting (mass organization) before they were implemented among the students. Now, the departmental committee directly implements the decisions among the students; previously, some things were reported separately in the Party, League, and mass organizations, but now, for things related to mass work, only mass meetings are held to report (Party and League members participate), and no more Party and League meetings are held; for common problems of the Party and the League, only one Party or League meeting is held; 4. No Party or League meetings are held during study time from Monday to Friday; 5. Everyone makes a weekly schedule to avoid wasting time; 6. Scientific division of labor and careful planning for Party and League work. In the past, Party and League branch secretaries and branch committees were busier. Now, they are divided into five types: Party branch secretary, Party branch propaganda and education committee member, organization committee member, League branch secretary, and League branch committee member. Everyone plans in advance their monthly working time (including meetings, understanding the situation, researching problems, checking work, etc.). However, recently another problem has been discovered, that is, sometimes many meetings are piled up in one week, which affects study time. Now, they are preparing to stipulate a "calendar" at the beginning of each month, appropriately staggering the time of various Party, League, and mass organization meetings within a month, and implementing it after obtaining the consent of the mass organizations. After Party and League work was oriented towards learning, professors and students felt that the things that Party and League members were doing were exactly what they themselves should be doing, which greatly improved the masses' view of the Party and the League. A student in the Faculty of Arts, who used to be in opposition to the Party and League members, said, "In the past, I felt that Party and League members were just Party and League members, but now I feel that they are also classmates." In the past, the study order had not been stabilized for two or three weeks after the start of school, but this semester, the library was crowded with people as soon as school started. Some students who were not active in studying in the past also felt ashamed of falling behind and became active. Many students who were dissatisfied with Party and League members in the past have now become activists and are applying to join the League.

    Criticize Erroneous Ideas Through Concrete Examples
    Second, seize on actual examples of being divorced from the masses and launch criticism and self-criticism within the Party. Generally, Party members have many problems in contacting the masses, such as: not treating backward masses as objects we should unite and educate, and Party and League members are unwilling to approach students who live more extravagantly. They only see the backward side of them and do not see their advantages, so they think that they are "hopeless backward elements." Some Party and League members contact the masses purely for the sake of developing the League, or purely for a certain task. They are not happy to contact those who have no hope of joining the League in the short term; or they no longer care about others after a certain thing is done or a meeting is held. Therefore, some students said, "League members took care of me all the time when I first entered school, but now they don't even nod their heads." Some misunderstand that contacting the masses is just "laughing and joking" and "not talking about serious things," fearing that talking about serious things will "stimulate" the masses. According to the statistics of 83 League members at that time, 40% of them only had superficial emotional contact with the masses and would not help students make progress ideologically.

    For example, after the summer vacation, someone made a strange noise when someone made a report in the dining hall. Some people also deliberately made trouble in the political class discussion. However, most Party and League members turned a blind eye to these things. At that time, the General Branch seized on this problem and convened a Party member meeting to review the branch's mass work. Through these facts, everyone reviewed the mistakes of the branch's work in being divorced from the masses, and also criticized the idea of treating uniting the masses as "harmony." In this way, they always seized on concrete examples to educate Party and League members to be able to live closely with the masses, and dare to criticize erroneous ideas and actions in an appropriate way, and pay attention to helping students solve ideological depression, so that students are happy to approach Party and League members.

    Branch Activities Should Start From the Demands of the Masses
    Third, branch work should start from the demands of the masses. In the past, Party and League members did not pay attention to welfare work, and the school's meals were very poor. Some students said, "It's always politics, but they don't care about things that really serve the students." At this time, each department-level elected a food committee, and Party and League members took the initiative to work with the students. Not only was the welfare work itself done well, but also the students were united in the work. In the past, students felt that Party and League members had "the same way of life" and that "all activities had a revolutionary tail," which was not suitable for their tastes. Therefore, some students joined the fellowship, and some students hugged together and held their own parties and dances without participating in student union activities or approaching Party and League members. According to this situation, around the New Year, the branch promoted the student union to hold various recreational activities, popularizing recreational activities to all departments, making the department-level life active, so that many students who did not show up often participated in student union activities and often approached Party and League members.

    Widely Absorb Students to Participate in the Leadership Work of Mass Organizations
    Fourth, widely absorb students to participate in the leadership work of mass organizations to overcome the work style of Party and League members taking on everything themselves. In the past, the proportion of Party and League members in various mass organizations was very large, almost monopolizing them. For example, half of the representatives to the student congress were Party and League members; three of the nine cadres in the Economics Department's department cadre meeting were Party members and four were League members. In this way, it was impossible to widely represent the opinions of the masses in all aspects, and it was also impossible to mobilize everyone to do things. Many students said, "The student union is the tail of the Party and the League." They do not care about the student union and do not regard it as their own organization. At the same time, it is easy for Party and League members to form a style of taking on everything themselves in their work. Now, we ensure that students are widely absorbed to participate in the leadership of mass organizations. In this way, everyone cares about various activities, and even students who were opposed to us in the past are willing to work actively. For example, in the 1950 spring student congress, the number of Party and League members was less than one-third of the total number of people. The representatives also included many students who were emotionally opposed to us at ordinary times.

    In this case, everyone regarded the representative meeting as a place for them to speak, and actively spoke. The conference was truly a student congress of their own, carrying forward democracy.

    Fifth, invite the masses to participate in Party and League meetings. In the past, the vast majority of students did not understand what the Party, the League, and Party and League members were doing in the school, and they did not know what kind of people could become Party and League members. Later, we decided to invite the masses to participate in Party and League meetings on the principle of conscious voluntariness. Once, at a Party branch meeting, a work report was made, reviewing the study attitude and welfare work. The students who attended the meeting reflected, "It turns out that Party and League members also attach great importance to studying" and "It turns out that the work of Party and League members is for everyone."

    At first, when the masses participated in Party meetings, they just went to listen and did not dare or want to speak at the meeting. Later, seeing that the Party attached great importance to their opinions, they also actively spoke and often made very correct criticisms. Now, almost every time a Party or League branch meeting is held, students come to participate. Especially when discussing people from the same department joining the Party or the League, everyone seriously puts forward their opinions.

    Some Party members who did not pay attention to contacting the masses in the past have made great progress after being criticized by students at the meeting; we thought that there were no shortcomings in many tasks, but after everyone pointed them out, we realized that there were still many problems. Due to everyone's supervision, the comrades' work has been more cautious and active than in the past. We will make more efforts in this regard in the future and mobilize the vast number of students to pay attention to the work of the Party.

    After more than half a year of efforts, Party-mass relations at Yenching University have changed from opposition to unity. However, some Party members still feel that they are more advanced than the non-Party masses, so they cannot humbly learn from the masses. After the Party Central Committee issued instructions on studying Stalin and Mao Zedong's theories on Communist Party members being good at uniting and cooperating with the non-Party masses, some comrades said, "It is okay to learn from workers and peasants, but what can we learn from intellectuals like those at Yenching University?" We are paying attention to solving these problems in this study.

### 从对立到团结——燕京大学党群关系的改善

　　从对立到团结
    ——燕京大学党群关系的改善
    中共燕大总支书记  林寿晋
    “以前觉得党、团员就是党、团员，现在觉得他们也是同学了。”这是燕京大学总支部，自一九四九年秋季始业，努力改善党群关系以后，文学院一位过去对党、团员持对立态度的同学说的话。这句话概括地说明了半年中燕大党群关系改变的一个方面。
    去秋开学时，燕京大学党群关系很坏。党员缺少工作锻炼，并且只习惯于地下工作方式（校内全是新党员和地下党员）。党员思想上关门主义倾向相当严重：工作不从群众要求出发，或者是只看到群众落后的一面，做起工作总喜欢包办代替。同时，由于过去搞惯了轰轰烈烈的学生运动，以致没有认识到解放后学校党、团员的中心任务是学好正课。很多党、团员不重视正课学习，功课搞得很不好。加上五百多新同学（当时全校共九百多同学）中大部来自新区，对党、团的认识上存在着不少问题。所以党员群众间的隔阂更深，非党团员同学中有人说“不知党、团员成天忙些什么？”有的在讨论会上不敢发言，说是“怕党、团员调查思想”。机械系二年级大部非党同学都不很满意党、团员。他们不欢迎党、团员参加他们的互助小组。讨论政治课时故意讲些怪话逗党、团员发急。而党、团员却只觉得同学落后，不敢坚持原则。西语系一位同学说：“你们说要为同学服务，但又不知道同学要你们服什么务，你们怎样服法呢？”
    总支委员会在中共北京市委学支科帮助下，认识了党员在团结群众方面的错误思想和不良作风，对同学情况重新研究估计，通过了以下几种具体工作，使党群关系得以改善。
    党团工作面向学习
    首先是纠正党、团员轻视正课学习的偏向。在解放后第一个学期中，因为一般党、团员都习惯于领导地下斗争，以为党、团员在学校的工作就是搞政治运动和政治学习，而不重视学好正课。去年九月底，学习蒋南翔同志关于“开展新民主主义学习”的报告后，大家的认识才开始转变。同时在学期中进行了学习检查，纠正党、团员学习态度和学习方法上的偏向，提出“学好正课就是中心任务”等口号，使大部党员已能在学习上起模范带头作用，组织同学解决学习上的问题。除了化学系外，全校党员成绩都在中上等。党、团员并主动帮助教授讲师了解同学要求，改进教学方法。同时组织同学改善学习方法，如原来温习一章生物需三小时到四小时，后来用看图互相问答的方法，只需一小时，而且还记得很牢。
    从此，教授和同学对党、团员的看法开始有了转变，认为党、团员对学习还是能起带动作用的。但党、团员对于学习还有两种错误思想：一是不了解自己最主要的任务是学好正课，掌握科学知识。往往将工作和学习对立起来，认为工作是为党的，学习是为自己的，只要将工作做好，学习差些也不要紧。有的虽然了解到学习就是党交给自己的任务，但认识不深刻，对自己要求不严格，学习热情不高。另外一个问题就是觉得旧文化没有什么可学。特别是文法学院，不会批判地接受旧文化中有用的东西，因而不积极钻研。同时工作和学习时间上也还有矛盾。这时一面学习文件指示克服错误思想；一面提出具体办法解决工作和学习时间的矛盾：一、党、团员担任党团职务时不得兼职；二、规定每月开会次数；三、精简组织机构，合并会议层次。例如以往系务委员会（行政组织）决议要通过干事会（群众组织）讨论后再贯彻到同学中去，现在系委会决定后直接贯彻到同学中；以前有些事情在党、团、群众团体分开报告，现在有关群众工作的事情，就只召开群众会议报告（党、团员参加），不再召开党、团会议；有关党和团的共同问题，则只召开一次党或团的会议；四、星期一至星期五学习时间内不开党、团会议；五、每人作出一周作息时间表，避免浪费时间。六、党内团内工作科学分工精细打算。以前党和团的分支书、分支委一级较忙，这时分为党分支书、党分支宣教委员、组织委员、团分支书、团分支委五种。每人都预先计划出每月的工作时间（包括会议、了解情况、研究问题、检查工作等）。但最近又发现了一个问题，就是有时很多会议堆在一个星期，影响学习时间。现在准备每月初规定出一个“日历表”，将一月之内的党、团、群众团体各种会议时间适当错开，征得各群众团体同意而后执行。党、团工作面向学习以后，教授和同学都觉得党、团员要做的事情正是他们自己要做的事情，这样就大大改善了群众对党团的看法。文学院一个以前和党、团员闹对立的同学说：“以前觉得党、团员就是党、团员，现在觉得他们也是同学了。”以往开学后两三星期学习秩序尚未安定，这学期一开学，图书馆就挤满了人。有些以往学习不积极的同学，也感到学习落后可耻而积极起来。有很多以往对党、团员不满的同学，现在也变成积极分子，纷纷要求入团了。
    通过具体事例批判错误思想
    第二，抓住脱离群众的实际例子，在党内展开批评和自我批评。一般党员在联系群众方面存在着很多问题，如：把落后群众不当做我们要团结教育的对象，党、团员不愿意接近生活比较奢华的同学。只看到他们落后的一面，未看到他们的优点，因而，认为他们是“落后分子无可救药”。有的党、团员联系群众就是单纯地为了发展团，或单纯地为了某一件工作。对短期内没有希望入团的就不高兴联系了；或是某一件事情作完、会开完就不再管别人。因此有的同学说“我一入学时团员整天照顾我，现在连头也不点了。”有的误解联系群众只是“嘻嘻哈哈”、“言不及义”，怕谈正经话会“刺激”群众。当时根据八十三个团员的统计，有百分之四十的人对群众只是表面上的感情上联系，不会在思想上帮助同学进步。
    如暑假后，饭厅有人作报告时，有人怪声叫好。政治课讨论也有人故意捣乱。但大部分党、团员对这些事情却熟视无睹。当时总支便抓紧这个问题，召开党员大会，检讨支部的群众工作。通过这些事实大家检讨了支部工作中脱离群众的错误，同时也批判了把团结群众当做“一团和气”的思想。这样，随时抓住具体事例，教育了党、团员能够亲密地和群众生活在一起，而又敢于以适当的方式对错误的思想和行动进行批评，并注意帮助同学解决思想上的苦闷，使得同学都乐于和党、团员接近。
    支部活动要从群众要求出发
    第三，支部工作要从群众要求出发。以前党、团员不重视福利工作，学校膳食搞得很糟。有的同学说：“老是一套政治，真正为同学服务的事情却不管。”这时各系级竞选膳委，党、团员主动地和同学一起工作。非但福利工作本身搞好，而且在工作中也团结了同学。以前同学觉得党、团员“生活方式一样”，觉得“什么活动都挟了一条革命尾巴”，不适合他们的口味。因而一部分同学入了团契，一部分同学自己抱在一起，自己开联欢会、舞会而不参加学生会的活动，也不和党、团员接近。根据这种情况，在新年前后支部推动了学生会举行各种文娱活动，将文娱活动普及到各系级，使系级生活活跃起来，这样很多不露面的同学也经常参加学生会的活动，经常和党、团员接近了。
    广泛吸收同学参加群众团体的领导工作
    第四，广泛吸收同学参加群众团体的领导工作，克服党、团员包办代替作风。过去在各群众团体中，党、团员人数比例很大，几成独占。例如学生代表大会的代表中一半是党、团员；经济系系干事会九个干事中有三个是党员四个是团员。这样，既不能广泛代表各方面群众的意见，也不能发动大家做事情。有很多同学说：“学生会是党、团的尾巴。”对学生会不关心，不看作是自己的团体。同时容易使党、团员在工作中形成包办代替。现在则保证广泛吸取同学参加群众团体的领导。这样一来，大家对各种活动都关心起来，就是以前和我们对立的同学也肯积极工作了。例如：一九五○年春季学生代表大会，党、团员人数就不到全体人数的三分之一。代表中并包括很多平时和我们感情上对立的同学。
    在这种情况下，大家便把代表会看作是自己说话的地方，而踊跃发言。使大会真正是发扬民主的学生自己的代表大会。
    第五，邀请群众参加党和团的会议。以前绝大部分同学都不了解党、团和党、团员在学校究竟做些什么，也不知道什么人才可以做党、团员。后来我们决定在自觉自愿的原则下邀请群众参加党、团的会议。有一次党支部大会作工作报告，检讨学习态度和福利工作，参加会的同学反映说：“原来党、团员也很重视念书”、“原来党、团的工作就是为了大家。”
    最初，群众参加党的会议时，只是去听听，不敢也不愿意在会上说话。后来看见党很重视他们的意见，便也踊跃发言，而且常常还提出很正确的批评。现在几乎每一次党、团分支开会时，都有同学来参加。特别是讨论同系的人入党入团时，大家都很认真的提意见。
    有些以前不注意联系群众的党员，经同学在会上批评后，有很大进步；很多工作我们以为没有缺点了，经大家指出后才发现还有不少问题。由于大家的监督，同志们的工作都较以往谨慎积极。我们以后将在这方面作更多的努力，发动广大同学注意党的工作。
    经过半年多的努力，燕大党群关系已由对立而走向团结。但有些党员还是觉得自己较非党群众进步，因而不能虚心向群众学习。这次党中央发布了学习斯大林、毛泽东论共产党员要善于和非党群众团结合作的指示后，有些同志说：“向工农学习可以，像燕京这样的知识分子，有什么可以学习的呢？”在这次学习中正注意解决这些问题。
