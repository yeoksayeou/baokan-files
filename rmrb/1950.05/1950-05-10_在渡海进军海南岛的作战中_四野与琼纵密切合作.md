　　Xinhua News Agency, Qiongya, 8th. In the great campaign to liberate Hainan Island, the Qiongya Column of the People's Liberation Army, which had persisted in fighting behind enemy lines for a long time, fought side by side with the Fourth Field Army's sea-crossing troops and took care of each other with great warmth, fully demonstrating the spirit of close unity and class love of the people's army. Since the first stealth landing of the sea-crossing troops, the commanders and fighters of the Qiongya Column preferred to fill their stomachs with sweet potatoes and give rice and grain to their brother troops; they vacated their houses and beds so that the brother troops could live and sleep well, while they themselves slept on the floor; and they did their best to rescue the wounded and sick soldiers of the sea-crossing troops. Sometimes, the warriors of the Qiong Column endured hunger and thirst, braved the scorching heat, and transported the wounded through the narrow mountain paths; sometimes, in the pouring rain, they used their raincoats, bamboo hats, and clothes to cover the wounded and sick soldiers of the sea-crossing troops, while they themselves marched forward naked and exposed to the rain. Many female comrades enthusiastically took care of the wounded soldiers, feeding them and washing their clothes. Chen Qingshan, deputy director of the political department of the Qiongya Column, saw that a cook, Zeng Liangeng, of a certain unit of the sea-crossing troops was suffering from malaria on the roadside, and immediately dismounted his horse to help him onto the horse, while he himself walked forward. These enthusiastic and friendly actions deeply moved the wounded and sick soldiers who were fighting across the sea, and they said, "The brother troops are even closer than our own brothers!" In order to rescue the wounded, the heroic soldiers of the Qiongya Column were not afraid of any sacrifice. When the army made its third sea-crossing landing, the landing vanguard battalion cooperated with the Eighth Regiment of the Qiong Column to take a certain height on the coast of Lingao County to meet the landing troops, but when they transferred their station after completing their mission, a battalion of bandit troops chased after them. Fu Shuilian, the deputy squad leader of a certain company of the Qiong Column, led a combat team to cover the retreat of the entire company. They found a wounded soldier from the vanguard battalion in a haystack who had not been evacuated in time. In such an emergency, Fu Shuilian and the other two soldiers decided to rescue the wounded soldier from danger. So, they selected a terrain, set up machine guns and rifles, and bravely fired at the gradually approaching enemy. At this time, bullets from both sides rained down on them like hail from the top of the mountain. Both soldiers gloriously sacrificed their lives, and Fu Shuilian's left hand was also injured. But he finally took advantage of the gap in the enemy's fire to quickly help the wounded soldier into a small grove, and quickly picked up some dry leaves to cover and hide the wounded soldier tightly. Then, he carried his machine gun and broke through the siege from the weak point of the enemy fire on the left flank, and then quickly led a company to repel the bandit troops and safely rescue the wounded vanguard battalion soldier.

　　在渡海进军海南岛的作战中
    四野与琼纵密切合作
    【新华社琼崖八日电】在解放海南岛的伟大战役中，长期坚持敌后斗争的人民解放军琼崖纵队，与第四野战军渡海部队并肩作战，并互相亲切照顾，充分发挥了人民军队的亲密团结的阶级友爱精神。自渡海部队第一次潜渡登陆以后，琼崖纵队的指战员们自己宁愿用地瓜充饥，而将米粮让给兄弟部队吃；他们腾出房子和床铺，要兄弟部队住好、睡好，自己则睡在地板上；对于渡海部队的伤病员，则更加用最大的努力去救护。琼纵的战士们有时忍受饥渴，冒着酷热，通过羊肠山道运送伤员；有时在大雨滂沱中，用自己的雨布、斗笠、衣服遮盖着渡海部队的伤病员，自己则光身露体冒雨前进。很多女同志热情地看护着伤员们，给伤员们喂饭、洗衣。琼崖纵队政治部副主任陈青山，看见渡海部队某部炊事员曾连庚在路旁发疟疾，连忙下马扶他上马，自己步行前进。这些热情友爱的行动，深深地感动了渡海作战的伤病员，他们说：“兄弟部队真比自己的亲兄弟还亲啊！”为了抢救伤员，英勇的琼崖纵队的战士们是不怕任何牺牲的。当大军第三次渡海登陆时，登陆先锋营曾配合琼纵八团打下临高县海岸某高地，接应登陆部队，但在完成任务后转移驻地的时候，匪军的一个营在后面尾追。琼纵某连班副符水连率领战斗小组掩护全连撤退。他们从草堆里发现一个未及运走的先锋营的伤员。在这样紧急的情况下，符水连和其余两个战士决定要抢救伤员出险，于是选好地形，架起机枪和步枪，向逐渐迫近的敌人英勇射击。这时子弹从两侧从山顶像冰雹般交织在他们的前后左右。两个战士都光荣牺牲了，符水连的左手也受伤。但他终于趁着敌人射击的空隙，迅速将伤员扶进小树丛里，并迅速拾些枯树叶，严密地将伤员盖好掩藏起来，然后端着机枪从左翼敌火薄弱处突出重围，再迅速率领一连人击退匪军，把受伤的先锋营战士安全地抢救回来。
