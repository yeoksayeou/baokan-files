　　Stalin and Stalin's Leadership
    Molotov
    Following Lenin, Comrade Stalin leads the Soviet Communist Party; under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, the Soviet Union has been victoriously building a communist society for more than twenty-five years. How great a blessing this is for our motherland and for the entire communist cause is now especially evident. During this historic period, our country, as a socialist state, has consolidated and matured, and has become the decisive factor in the powerful rise of all progressive humanity. In this regard, Comrade Stalin, Stalin's leadership, has the greatest merit. Stalin's leadership ensures the ideological unity of our Party based on Marxist-Leninist principles, and ensures that the Soviet people continue to advance along the path indicated by the great Lenin.
    As early as the end of 1936, in the report "On the Draft Constitution of the Soviet Union," Comrade Stalin said:
    "We now have a fully formed and tested multinational socialist state, whose stability is the envy of any national state on any continent."
    Everyone knows that the Stalin Constitution established this conclusion and became the foundation for the further rise and more comprehensive development of our country's strength.
    In 1946, when summarizing World War II and formulating new tasks for socialist construction, Comrade Stalin pointed out the world-historical significance of the Soviet army's victory in this war. Comrade Stalin pointed out at that time that in this war, "our Soviet social system won," and proved that this system is "the best form of social organization compared to any non-Soviet social system"; at the same time, in this war, "our Soviet state system won," and proved that "the Soviet state system is a model of a multinational state; the Soviet state system is such a national organization system, in which the national question and the cooperation of all nationalities are resolved better than in any other multinational state."
    It is very clear that if the Soviet people had not previously achieved great successes in the cause of political and economic rise of the Soviet state under the leadership of our Party, then we would not have been able to achieve this victory. If it were not for that, we would not have the economic strength of the state, the unity of the working class and all working people around the Party and Comrade Stalin, and the infinite determination of the Soviet people to protect the Soviet state from enemy invasion, and those factors were of decisive significance for the victorious end of the war.
    This great victory was possible because the people of our country had achieved socialist achievements in the years before the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War.
    First of all, it was necessary to establish a socialist economic foundation, thereby placing the state system of the proletarian dictatorship, based on the alliance of the working class and the masses of working peasants, on a solid cornerstone. The socialist state industrialization policy is in line with this task, and the socialist state industrialization policy is embodied in the famous Stalin Five-Year Plans. During these years, the construction of thousands of factories and manufacturing plants was launched, and many new industrial zones and industrial cities were created. The implementation of this policy consolidated and enhanced the leading role of the working class in the Soviet Union. Stalin's industrialization policy made it possible to realize the technological transformation of our entire national economy. On the basis of this policy, we have ensured the continuous and increasingly growing rise of Soviet industry, especially heavy industry, ensured that our national economy is free from dependence on capitalist countries, and ensured the continuous improvement of the material welfare and cultural level of our working class and all working people.
    Secondly, it was necessary to solve the task put forward by history for the first time: to transition millions of small, backward farms to the orbit of large-scale collective farms equipped with new technologies. The theory of collective farm construction formulated by Comrade Stalin laid the foundation for the famous agricultural cooperative charter. This theory, and its wise principle of combining the individual interests of collective farmers with the decisive significance of the collective farm's public economy, as well as Stalin's direct leadership of the mass collective farm movement, ensured the successful solution of this historical task, thereby eliminating the rich peasants and all the remaining capitalist elements, and establishing a socialist organization of the entire national economy in the Soviet Union. The collectivization of farms made it possible for us to extensively adopt advanced technologies and scientific achievements of agronomy in the large collective farms established at this time. Only after the collectivization of farms has been realized, agriculture is no longer an obstacle to the rise of our national economy, but the prospects of unlimited economic rise and cultural rise have been opened up in front of the collective farmers. And only from this perspective can we understand that we are now able to realize many new plans, such as the huge plan adopted last year to ensure a constant and abundant harvest in the steppe and forest-steppe areas of our European part, which no capitalist country can accomplish.
    The national industrialization policy and the farm collectivization policy, as well as the mass shock work and socialist competition launched under Stalin's leadership, transformed our motherland. Capitalist elements have been completely eliminated.
    Our working class has changed from the exploited and oppressed into the leading force of the Soviet state, leading the Soviet people in the cause of socialist construction. The peasants of the Soviet Union have established collective farms with all the advantages of modern large farms, freed themselves from the exploitation of rich peasants, speculators, usurers, and other exploiters – the spiders of the countryside, and have begun a new, prosperous, and cultural life. The current Soviet intellectuals are no longer the old intellectuals, but new, people's, socialist intellectuals. Most of them come from workers, peasants, and other working people, and are willing to serve their people loyally. Within our country, a socialist society has been established and consolidated; in this society, there are no capitalists, no exploitation of man by man, and at the same time, the roots of capitalist restoration have been permanently eradicated.
    The fundamental social reforms carried out in the Soviet Union are of particularly great significance because our country is a multi-ethnic country; because the various ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, although they have their own history, and even their current lifestyles often differ, are all advancing along a common path of socialist development. At the same time, one of the most prominent achievements of Stalin's leadership is the great friendship of all nationalities, as well as brotherly cooperation and mutual assistance; this friendship, as well as cooperation and mutual assistance, has been achieved in our country under the banner of socialist internationalism, and is being consolidated day by day.
    These achievements of socialism in the Soviet Union, and the great progressive significance that is becoming increasingly powerful, are attracting more attention from other nations because everyone sees the continuing deepening of the general crisis of the capitalist system, more and more countries are breaking away from this system, capitalism no longer has the prospect of general rise, and the more powerful capitalist powers are wantonly plundering and weakening other capitalist countries and dependencies, first of all, carrying out inhuman exploitation of the laboring masses in these countries, in order to save their own situation in one way or another. It is now an undeniable fact that in the capitalist countries of the Americas and Europe, new economic crises are growing, and the ranks of the unemployed and semi-unemployed are increasing; at the same time, the Soviet Union, without crises and unemployment, is advancing confidently along the road of economic rise and prosperity.
    Our enemies in the capitalist camp once predicted that after the end of World War II, the Soviet Union would inevitably experience a long-term economic decline. Contrary to this prediction, our country has successfully cleared away the serious consequences left by the war and enemy occupation, realized the comprehensive rise of the national economy, and our industry has reached a much higher level than in the pre-war years. The workers, peasants, and intellectuals of the Soviet Union have seen that they live better today than yesterday, and they are very clear that they will live better tomorrow than today. They believe in their own tomorrow, they have seen with their own eyes how the Soviet Union has grown and consolidated year by year. They know that they have reliable leaders - the Communist Party, and a wise leader - the great Stalin.
    Comrade Stalin's greatest achievement is that in all these years, no matter what difficulties we encountered on our road, the Bolshevik Party has always held high the banner of fighting for the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union.
    There have been many Trotskyites, rightists, and other various traitors and dissidents within the Party. They spread doubts about the possibility of socialism achieving victory in the Soviet Union surrounded by capitalism. Especially after Lenin's death, various agents of class enemies launched political attacks on the Party and the socialist construction policy implemented by the Party. Comrade Stalin defended and developed Lenin's theory that socialism can be victorious in one country, the theory that socialism can be victorious in the Soviet Union.
    In our era, there is no need to argue about the scientific correctness of this theory, and there is no need to prove that in the era of imperialism, under the conditions of unbalanced development of capitalist countries, socialism cannot achieve victory in all countries at the same time, but may achieve victory first only in individual countries. Because the possibility of socialism winning first in individual countries has become the actual victory of the socialist system in the Soviet Union; in the Soviet Union, the prerequisites for transitioning to the advanced stage of communism are now being successfully created. This has overthrown all the slanders that socialism cannot be established in technologically and economically backward countries like Russia, not only in theory, but also in the fact of socialism's victory in our country; this is a slander borrowed from the reactionary source of bourgeois and social democratic thought.
    However, do not forget: if the Party had not had deep confidence in the possibility of this victory, if the Party had not defeated the doubters and waverers in its own ranks, if the Party had not inspired and guided our working class under the leadership of Comrade Stalin to bravely and resolutely overcome any anti-Leninist wavering, and to carry out an unyielding struggle against class enemies and their agents among the working people and within the Party itself, the Party could not have achieved this victory.
    This historical achievement of Stalin's leadership is of greater significance due to the fact that this historical achievement has the greatest international significance, giving a fatal blow to the social democratic suspicion that socialism can achieve victory; this suspicion is something that all communist parties can encounter in their own ranks. The victory of socialism in our country has clearly shown that the so-called "objective prerequisites" for socialist victory have long been ripe in European countries, and not only in European countries; therefore, resolutely overcoming the reactionary influence of the bureaucratization of the bourgeois social democracy, and the split that this bureaucratization has brought to the workers' movement, is the most important task of all loyal supporters of socialism now.
    Now, everyone has seen that our country has been transformed into a socialist country; the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union has guaranteed all the conditions for the further and more powerful development of the national economy, and for the steady improvement of the welfare of the Soviet people, and the international situation has also changed in many ways that are favorable to socialism and people's democracy. Many millions of Soviet people have made great strides in their cultural development during the years of the Soviet regime; now, they are fraternally and actively participating in the socialist construction of cities and villages, full of great understanding of the justice of their cause, and full of deep confidence in Stalin's wise leadership. We are successfully advancing in the cause of consolidating the socialist system and re-educating the Soviet people in socialism. This is reflected in the growth of the moral and political unity of Soviet society, and in the rise of Soviet patriotism, so that now in the world, there is no force that can make our people regress and return to capitalism.
    This is a glorious summary of the socialist development path that our country has experienced under the Stalin's leadership of the Bolshevik Party.
    As for the relations between the Soviet Union and other countries, as well as the entire international situation, important changes have taken place in this regard in recent years.
    Not long ago, the Soviet Union was still the only socialist country surrounded by hostile capitalism. Everyone knows how many attempts the imperialist powers have made to eliminate the first socialist country through direct armed intervention, economic blockade, and various despicable means, including creating conspiracies and assassinating Soviet activists, secretly sabotaging and feinting attacks. Ensuring the external conditions for the peaceful development of the Soviet Union was the basic task facing the foreign policy of the Soviet regime. This also required constant and vigilant concern for strengthening the power of the Soviet army, and required the Soviet army to be ready at any time to defend the country from attack. During the period from 1921 to 1941, our country pursued an independent Soviet foreign policy, ensuring the peaceful conditions for its development. This fact is a great achievement of Stalin's foreign policy - a policy of peace. Stalin's foreign policy, relying on the victory of socialist construction and the consolidation of national power, made it possible for us to turn the pre-war peaceful period into a peaceful twenty years, thereby solving the task of turning the Soviet Union into a powerful socialist power; this power gloriously passed all the tests of the recent war.
    World War II ended with the complete victory of the Soviet Union and the Allied countries over the fascist aggressors. This war caused the great efforts of all forces of the Soviet people, and at the same time, showed the world the economic power of our country and the indestructible unity of the various ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, this power and unity were built up in the years before the war under the Party’s leadership of Stalin. The Soviet people, with their selfless struggle, "saved European civilization from the fascist bandits" (Stalin). The Soviet army has illuminated our motherland with the unparalleled meritorious service it created in this war. The special role played by Comrade Stalin in organizing the great victory is known to everyone.
    In order to organize the cause of victory, Comrade Stalin directly and personally took charge of the political and economic leadership of the entire country, just as he commanded the armed forces of the entire country and personally took charge of the military leadership itself. This inspired the army and the entire people to fight selflessly and heroically. This ensured the rapid reconstruction of the country's economy in accordance with military needs. The huge Soviet army established under the direct leadership of Comrade Stalin during the war was established according to the principles of Stalin's military science, and became an elite modern army. All this made it possible for us to create a fundamental change in the course of the war, and ensured the victorious implementation of Stalin's strategic plan to crush the enemy. The delay in opening the Second European Front made the world understand that the honor of defeating fascism in Europe and later in the Far East belongs first and foremost to the Soviet army and its unparalleled Stalin's leadership. This victory, which has world-historical significance, has illuminated our country, the Soviet army, and its great commander - Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin.
    At the same time, everyone knows how important a role the anti-fascist alliance composed of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and their other allies played in crushing the armed forces of the "Axis" powers. Stalin's foreign policy, in the period before World War II, prevented the establishment of a united anti-Soviet front by capitalist countries. Thanks to Stalin's foreign policy, the aggressive fascist countries fell into an isolated position, while the Soviet Union occupied its due position in the powerful anti-fascist alliance. Here, Comrade Stalin's personal role is of special significance to the entire course of events. Comrade Stalin’s characteristics: profound knowledge of the historical aspects of various nations, multifaceted experience of leaders of the international communist movement, the ability to understand and accurately guess strategic plans and tactical routines of various countries, and the courage and flexibility to solve complex international affairs, these characteristics determined the decisive achievements of the Soviet foreign policy.
    In order to establish the anti-Hitler tripartite alliance during the war, it was necessary to first disintegrate the anti-Soviet plans of the British and French governments and the imperialist groups that supported them; the purpose of these plans was to push Germany to fight against the Soviet Union, and then sacrifice them, especially the Soviet Union, so as to profit from it. When a situation had finally become clear, the Soviet Union even had to conclude a non-aggression pact with Germany. This situation was: in order to resist the growing fascist aggression of the "Axis" powers, all the efforts of the Soviet government to establish a united front with other European countries were sabotaged by the British and French governments due to their blind hatred of the Soviet workers' and peasants' state. Comrade Stalin accurately guessed the cunning intentions of the then British and French anti-Soviet conspiracy, which not only freed our country from attack and delayed Hitler's Germany's attack on the Soviet Union, but also made the development of events go to a situation in which the British and American governments were forced to face the necessity of establishing a British-Soviet-American anti-fascist alliance, thereby conforming to the interests of all freedom-loving people.
    The changes in the international situation caused by World War II and the growth of the Soviet Union's role are obvious enough.
    The first proof of this is the fact that a series of people's democratic countries have been established in Europe and Asia; they are now confidently embarking on the road of socialist construction. Only desperate reactionaries would indulge in a ridiculous fantasy in our time, which is to make the people of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, or Korea, not to mention the Mongolian People's Republic, return to the old conditions, to the position of docile slaves of landlords and the bourgeoisie. We cannot but recognize the world significance of the founding of the People's Republic of China. The People's Republic of China has blown up the foundation of imperialism in Asia. For the great Chinese people, the road to freedom and happiness has been opened, and especially important is that they now have their reliable leader - the Communist Party of China. Comrade Stalin used the following sensational words to the world to determine the great significance of the establishment of the German Democratic Republic: The establishment of the peace-loving democratic republic of Germany is a turning point in European history. There is no doubt that the side-by-side existence of a peace-loving democratic Germany and a peace-loving Soviet Union makes new wars in Europe no longer possible, ends the bloodshed in Europe, and makes it impossible for world imperialism to enslave European countries.
    Under the current conditions, all the people's democratic countries that safeguard the cause of peace and democracy are in the same camp as the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries are unconcerned with the imperialist desires and policies of plunder. They are vitally interested in ensuring solid peace living conditions for their newly liberated people, and in ensuring friendly and equal relations with the people of other countries.
    However, we should not forget that there is also another camp.
    Although World War II ended not so long ago, the imperialist countries, and first of all the British and American ruling groups, are busy feverishly preparing for a new war. Haunted by the feeling of doubting their own domestic strength, they are drawing up one new plan of aggression after another, expanding their military budgets, and establishing military bases as well as military attack alliances and groups, thereby exposing how great a danger the current policy of imperialist powers poses to the peaceful life of the people of all countries; this policy produces various adventurous plans to rule the world by any means of aggression, including atomic warfare.
    However, times have changed.
    Another fact of great significance is the increased activism of the people all over the earth in the struggle to consolidate peace, and at the same time, the increasing awareness that empty pacifist wishes cannot guarantee lasting peace. The peace movement throughout all countries is one of the most obvious manifestations of the desire of the people of all countries for world peace. This movement is participated in by hundreds of millions of manual and intellectual laborers, and encompasses all democratic trade unions, as well as millions of democratic groups of women, youth, and cultural workers established after the war. Everyone knows that the entire broad movement to safeguard peace, democracy, and progress regards the Soviet Union as its main pillar and hope, and Stalin's name is the great banner of this movement.
    From these facts, the growing role of the Communist and Workers' Parties in many countries can be understood. As Marxist-Leninist parties, despite all the persecutions and electoral conspiracies on the part of reactionary governments, they are still growing and consolidating ideologically. During the war, the prestige of the Communist Party among the people was unprecedentedly enhanced, because among the Communists emerged the most self-sacrificing anti-fascist fighters, the fighters who struggled for the rights and freedom of all nations. Now, any government that cares about its true prestige among its own people cannot fail to attach importance to the huge growth of the influence of communist ideology among the people. Everyone knows that in order to steal the Yugoslav government, the Tito group once pretended to be a friend of the Soviet Union and wore the mask of a Communist. However, the Tito traitorous group has become a gang of hired assassins and spies serving foreign imperialist governments, and its plans to be hostile to the Soviet Union and its own people have been exposed. The time when it suffers the shameful fate of being a lackey of imperialist reactionaries is not far away.
    All this means that after World War II, the deployment of international forces has undergone serious changes.
    The previous situation was that the only socialist country - the Soviet Union, was in the encirclement of the capitalist world. The new situation that has arisen instead of this situation is that the Soviet Union has stepped out of its isolated position internationally. It cannot be denied that this is the greatest achievement of Stalin's leadership. In our era, the Soviet Union is not alone in the cause of defending world peace. The people's democratic countries, as well as the entire international peace-supporting camp that has now been established, are upholding this cause together with the Soviet Union. Two camps have been formed: the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union, which safeguards universal and lasting peace in the struggle against the provokers of new wars; and the imperialist camp headed by the British and American ruling groups, which is implementing a policy of preparing for new wars, but is unable to stop the rising tide of the international peace movement.
    Therefore, the situation has become like this: if the imperialists launch a new world war, it will inevitably cause a universal counterattack from the peace-loving people of all countries and the entire democratic camp, this counterattack will not only cause certain aggressive powers to fail, as in the previous period, but will eliminate the entire system of world imperialism.
    This is the main summary of the changes in the international form, and the changes in the international situation show that in the present, the destiny of the peace-loving people and the interests of all progressive humanity are inextricably linked with the further achievements of the Soviet Union and the world democratic camp led by the recognized leader - the great Stalin.
    The Complete Works of Stalin, including works starting from 1901, are now being published. The theoretical and political significance of this publication work is inestimable.
    The great creative genius of the great Stalin, with all its diversity and spiritual wealth, is unfolding before our eyes like a picture, stage by stage. Here, the light of Marxist-Leninist thought illuminates the various practical work problems of the Bolshevik Party and the international communist movement, as well as the complex academic problems of history and philosophy; it explains the most acute problems of domestic and foreign policy, the fundamental problems of the Soviet economy, and the various stages of development of capitalist countries; it reveals the essence of the major problems of socialist culture with various national forms; at the same time, it also points out the significance of military problems that the Soviet regime has faced more than once. From the early years of the establishment of the Soviet regime, Comrade Stalin's personal special role in defending our motherland from external enemies and in thoroughly realizing the peaceful policies of the Soviet Union can also be understood. The peaceful policy of the Soviet Union has always been, and still is, the main task of Soviet foreign policy. In addition, there are many other things that can prove the greatness of the historical cause of our Party and its leadership of Stalin.
    As a great representative of creative Marxism, Comrade Stalin has developed the Leninist principles of our Party's strategy and tactics in many ways. This is of particularly great significance for the communist movements in various countries. Here, first of all, it should be said that the issue of the victory of socialism in individual countries; this issue was first raised by Lenin, and in Comrade Stalin's writings, it has been given a deep scientific explanation. Comrade Stalin elucidated and theoretically developed other major problems that the Party and the Soviet state had faced with Marxist-Leninist thought, including, for example: the Communist Party as a new type of revolutionary party, and especially the Party's leading role in the proletarian dictatorship system; the socialist industrialization of the Soviet Union, and its decisive significance for consolidating the Soviet state; the collectivization of millions of farms, and the elimination of the last exploiting class - the rich peasant class, as the completion of the socialist transformation of the entire economic base of our country; the issue of fully consolidating the socialist state under capitalist encirclement, and the issue of the conditions for the elimination of the state; the issue of nationality in the stage of bourgeois democratic revolution and the issue of national colonies under the conditions of socialist revolution, and especially the issue of socialist nationalities, and many other most important issues of the present. In Stalin's scientific works, the research on these issues and other issues is of the greatest urgent significance under the current conditions, not only for the Soviet Union, but also for other countries, here the other countries mentioned refer especially to countries that have embarked on the path of socialism or are conducting national liberation wars.
    At the same time, it cannot be forgotten that no matter how complete the complete works are, the kind of huge labor that Comrade Stalin has inspired our Party and the Soviet people cannot be reflected sufficiently. Comrade Stalin uses this labor every day to raise new problems, formulate all new and more ambitious plans for our socialist construction, draft the most important instructions of the Party and the government, including the main diplomatic documents, and organize the actual implementation of the adopted resolutions, etc. If it is not like this, the true scale of Stalin's leadership and its ideological significance cannot be explained.
    As a great inheritor of the immortal cause of Lenin, Comrade Stalin is the leader of our entire socialist construction. He unites the big family of all the nationalities of the Soviet Union, guides the workers of cities and villages to reach a common great goal, mobilizes Communists and non-Party members in our country to complete the task of building communism, and inspires the working class and oppressed nations of the world to engage in struggle. Stalin's leadership is permeated with a sense of responsibility for the historical mission of the Bolshevik Party, the Soviet state, and our entire cause. Conducting critical examinations of anyone, regardless of their past merits; firmly developing Bolshevik self-criticism; maintaining unremitting vigilance against any attack by class enemies and their still living lackeys; promoting new cadres who are ideologically strong and tested in work, as well as assisting the development of talented young people; fully launching socialist competition and any other form of broad mass participation in communist construction, at the same time, implementing all new measures to improve the cultural level and communist education of the Soviet people - this is the most powerful aspect of Stalin's leadership of our Party. Historically significant facts show that the Party, under the leadership of Comrade Stalin, has always successfully solved and is solving these combat tasks.
    In the brilliant article "On the Strategic and Tactical Problems of the Russian Communists" written by Comrade Stalin in 1923, he clearly defined the three historical turning points in our revolutionary history, as well as the three strategic plans of our Party corresponding to them. Regarding the third turning point, which is also the last turning point, Comrade Stalin wrote:
    "The third turning point began with the October Revolution: at that time, the life-and-death duel between the two imperialist groups in the West had reached its climax; the revolutionary crisis in Europe had clearly matured; the bankrupt Russian bourgeois regime, which had been confused by contradictions, collapsed under the blows of the proletarian revolution; the victorious proletarian revolution broke with imperialism, withdrew from the war, and discovered that the Western imperialist alliance was an irreconcilable enemy; the new Soviet government's decrees on peace, on confiscating landlords' lands, expropriating capitalists' property, and liberating oppressed nations, won the trust of millions of workers around the world? This is an international turning point, because the international capitalist front has been broken through for the first time, and the problem of overthrowing capitalism has been given a practical basis for the first time. This has turned the October Revolution from a national, Russian force into an international force, and has turned the Russian workers from the backward unit of the international proletariat into its vanguard, awakening the workers of the West and the oppressed countries of the East with their self-sacrificing struggle. This turning point has not yet reached its final development, because it has not yet unfolded on an international scale, but its content and general direction have been determined clearly enough." (See Stalin's Complete Works, Volume 5, pages 178-179)
    We can understand the profound significance and prophetic nature of these words of Stalin. At the same time, everyone now sees how far our country has advanced; since then, the international situation has undergone such serious changes precisely in the sense that Comrade Stalin wrote. This is especially evident in our days: the Soviet Union, as a country that has achieved socialist victory, with great rise in political, economic, and cultural aspects, is confidently advancing hand in hand with the friendly people's democratic countries; at the same time, the capitalist countries, regardless of their size, are increasingly losing confidence in tomorrow, cannot find a way out of the growing economic and political contradictions, and are undergoing one new economic disaster after another.
    In capitalist countries, the blind laws of spontaneous economic development dominate everything, and at the same time, periodic economic crises inevitably arrive, and the sharpening of social antagonism is increasing day by day. The Soviet state is different from capitalist countries; it is built on a completely different basis. In our country, due to the socialist revolution and the subsequent elimination of the exploiting classes, the entire national economy has a planned rise, which no capitalist country can hope for. In the Soviet Union, not only has the rise of the national economic life organized according to a unified development plan been realized, but other aspects of social life also have planning, the purpose of which is to accelerate the general and comprehensive rise of the culture of all ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, to improve and develop science and art. Only from this perspective can we understand the increasing achievements of Soviet science and technology, including the famous achievements in mastering atomic energy, which have surprised and confused all the enemies of the Soviet Union so much. The profound significance in principle and practice of the struggle against pseudo-science is becoming more and more evident day by day. In the Soviet Union, this struggle is being carried out by scientific workers armed with materialist dialectics. Our literature and art are increasingly becoming the flag bearers of our Stalin's era, contributing to the achievements of the Soviet people in many ways, inspiring them to work and struggle, and spreading the influence of the Soviet Union far beyond the motherland.
    No other country has ever had such great achievements. The limited vision of the bourgeoisie cannot understand this scale of problems at all. Only a solidified socialist society can afford such affairs, and put forward guiding scientific principles for all aspects of the country's economic and cultural life, thereby greatly increasing our strength very successfully, and making the Soviet Union superior to any country in the capitalist camp. This is also the reason why the moral and political prestige of the Soviet Union has risen unprecedentedly among the people of all ethnic groups on the whole earth.
    It is not accidental that the Party had to solve these great tasks. The Party gave our people and all mankind great leaders like Lenin and Stalin - giants of theoretical thought and revolutionary cause. If, after Lenin's death, the Soviet people victoriously solved their strategic and tactical tasks at home and abroad, making their country so powerful, and at the same time, spiritually so close to the workers of the world, then in this regard, the greatest historical merit belongs first and foremost to the great leader of our Party, Comrade Stalin, and to Stalin's leadership.
    This explains why the workers of our country have such unlimited trust in the wise leadership of Stalin, why they have such strong faith in Stalin's genius, and why the Soviet people and the workers of the world have such great love for Comrade Stalin.
    Today, on the day of his seventieth birthday, for the welfare and glory of our people, and for the happiness of all progressive humanity, we wish the great and dear Stalin, our leader, mentor, and friend, good health and longevity again and again.

　　斯大林和斯大林的领导
    莫洛托夫
    继列宁之后，斯大林同志领导苏联共产党；苏联在斯大林同志的领导下，胜利地建设着共产主义社会，已经二十五年多了。这对于我们的祖国，对于整个共产主义的事业，是多么伟大的幸福，现在是格外明显的了。在这个历史性的时期内，我们的国家，作为社会主义的国家，已经巩固起来了，羽毛丰满了，并且成了整个进步人类的力量强大高涨的决定因素了。在这方面，斯大林同志，斯大林的领导，有最伟大的功绩。斯大林的领导，保证了我们党以马列主义原则为基础的思想团结，保证了苏联人民沿着伟大的列宁所指示的道路不断地前进。             
    早在一九三六年年底，在“关于苏联宪法草案”的报告中，斯大林同志就曾经说过：
    “我们现在，已经有完全形成了的、并且经过一切考验的、多民族的社会主义国家；这个国家的巩固性，是任何大陆上的任何民族国家都会羡慕的。”
    大家都知道，斯大林宪法，确立了这个总结，成了我们国家力量进一步高涨和更加全面发展的基础。
    一九四六年，在总结第二次世界大战与拟定社会主义建设的新任务时，斯大林同志指出了苏联军队在这个战争中取得胜利的世界历史意义。斯大林同志当时指出：在这个战争中，“我们苏维埃的社会制度胜利了”，并且证明这个制度，“比起任何非苏维埃的社会制度，是最好的社会组织形式”；同时，在这个战争中，“我们苏维埃的国家制度胜利了”，并且证明“苏维埃的国家制度，是多民族国家的模范；苏维埃的国家制度，是这样的国家组织体系，在这里，民族问题和各民族合作问题，解决得比任何其他的多民族国家都要好些。”
    非常明显，如果以前没有苏联人民在我们党的领导下，获得苏维埃国家在政治高涨与经济高涨的事业上的伟大成绩，那么，我们就不能获得这种胜利。如果不是那样，我们就不会有那种国家经济力量，不会有工人阶级以及一切劳动者围绕在党与斯大林同志周围的那种团结，不会有苏联人民保护苏维埃国家不受敌人侵犯的那种无限决心，而那些因素，对于战争的胜利结束，是具有决定性意义的。
    这个伟大的胜利之所以可能取得，是由于在伟大的卫国战争未爆发以前的年代中，我国人民获得了社会主义的成绩。
    首先，曾经必须建立社会主义的经济基础，从而把以工人阶级与劳动农民群众的联盟为基础的、无产阶级专政的国家制度，安置在坚固的基石上。社会主义的国家工业化政策，是符合于这个任务的，社会主义的国家工业化政策，表现在著名的几个斯大林五年计划中。在这些年代中，展开了好几千个工厂与制造厂的建设，产生了许多新的工业区和工业城市。这个政策的实行，坚固了并且提高了工人阶级在苏联的领导作用。斯大林的工业化政策，使实现我国整个国民经济的技术改造成为可能。在这个政策的基础上，我们保证了苏维埃工业、特别是重工业的不断的、目益成长的高涨，保证了我们的国民经济摆脱对资本主义国家的依赖，保证了我国工人阶级与一切劳动者的物质福利与文化水平的不断提高。
    其次，曾经必须解决历史所第一次提出来的任务：使几百万小型的、落后的农场，过渡到大规模的、以新技术装备的集体农场的轨道上。斯大林同志所制定的集体农场建设的理论，奠定了著名的农业合作社章程的基础。这个理论，及其使集体农民的个人利益与集体农场公共经济的决定意义相结合的英明原则，以及斯大林对展开了的群众性集体农庄运动的直接领导，就保证了成功地解决这个历史任务，从而消灭了富农和一切还留下来的资本主义分子，并且在苏联建立了整个国民经济的社会主义组织的基础。农场的集体化，使我们有可能在此时所建立的大集体农场中，空前广泛地采用先进的技术和农学的科学成就。只有在农场的集体化实现以后，农业才已经不再是我国国民经济高涨的阻碍，而在集体农民面前，展开了无限的经济高涨与文化高涨的前途。并且只有从这方面着眼，才可以了解我们现在是能够实现许多新计划的，如像去年通过的保证我国欧洲部分草原区和森林草原区经常有丰富收成的措施的巨大计划，而这是任何资本主义国家所不能胜任的。
    国家工业化政策与农场集体化政策，以及在斯大林对党的领导下所展开的群众性的突击工作和社会主义竞赛，改造了我们的祖国。资本主义分子完全被消灭了。
    我们的工人阶级，从被剥削者和被压迫者，变成了苏维埃国家的领导力量，领导苏联人民从事社会主义建设的事业。苏联的农民，建立了具有现代化大农场的一切优越性的集体农场，从富农、投机商人、高利贷者以及其他剥削者——农村蜘蛛的剥削下获得解放，开始了新的、富裕的、文化的生活。目前的苏维埃知识分子，已不是旧的知识分子，而是新的、人民的、社会主义的知识分子。他们大都来自工人、农民以及其他劳动者之间，是甘心忠诚为自己的人民服务的。在我们国家内，已经建立了并且巩固地形成了社会主义社会；在这个社会里，没有资本家，没有人剥削人的现象，同时，资本主义复辟的根子，是永远被挖除了的。
    苏联所进行的根本的社会改革之所以有特殊伟大的意义，是因为我们的国家，乃是多民族的国家；是因为苏联的各民族，虽然各有各的历史，甚至目前的生活方式，也往往有所不同，却都在沿着一个共同的、社会主义的发展道路前进。同时，斯大林领导所具有的最显赫的成绩之一，就是各民族的伟大友谊，以及兄弟般的合作与互助；这种友谊以及合作与互助，是在社会主义的国际主义旗帜下在我国所达成的，并且正在一天比一天巩固着。
    社会主义在苏联所造成的这些成绩，及其愈来愈有力地显露的伟大进步意义，其所以更加引起其他民族的注意，乃是因为人人都看见了资本主义体系总危机的继续深刻化，愈来愈多的国家脱离了这个体系，资本主义已经没有总高涨的前途，而较强有力的资本主义大国，则正在肆意掠夺和削弱其他资本主义国家与附属国，首先是对这些国家的劳动群众进行惨无人道的剥削，以便这样或那样来挽救自己的情况。现在，已经隐藏不住的事实是：在美洲和欧洲的资本主义国家里，新经济危机在成长着，失业者与半失业者的好几百万行列，愈来愈有增加；与此同时，没有危机和没有失业现象的苏联，正满怀信心地沿着经济高涨与繁荣的道路前进着。
    我们的资本主义阵营的敌人们，曾经预言在第二次世界大战结束以后，苏联将不可避免地发生长期的经济衰落。与这种预言正相反，我们的国家，成功地肃清着战争与敌人占领所留下的严重后果，实现着国民经济的全面高涨，并且我们的工业，已经达到了比战前年代高得多的水平。苏联的工人、农民与知识分子，看出了他们今天生活得比昨天好，并且非常清楚，他们明天会比今天生活得更好。他们相信自己的明天，他们亲眼看见了苏联怎样一年比一年成长和巩固起来了。他们知道他们有可靠的领导者——共产党，有英明的领袖——伟大的斯大林。
    斯大林同志最伟大的功绩是，在这一切年代中，无论在我们道路上遇见了什么困难，布尔什维克党，一直是高举了为社会主义在苏联的胜利而斗争的旗帜。
    党内曾经有过不少托洛茨基分子，右派的和其他各种的叛徒和异已分子。他们对于社会主义可能在资本主义包围中的苏联取得胜利，散布了怀疑。特别是在列宁逝世以后，阶级敌人的各种代理人，对党和对党所施行的社会主义建设政策，展开了政击。斯大林同志维护了并且发展了列宁关于社会主义可能在个别国家胜利的理论，关于社会主义可能在苏联胜利的理论。
    在我们的时代，无需就这个理论在科学上的正确性进行争论，无需证明：在帝国主义时代，在资本主义国家发展不平衡的条件下，社会主义不可能同时在一切国家取得胜利，但可能首先仅在个别国家取得胜利。因为社会主义首先在个别国家胜利的可能性，已经变成了社会主义制度在苏联的现实的胜利；在苏联，现在正在为过渡到共产主义的高级阶段而顺利地创造着前提。这不仅在理论上，并且还有社会主义在我国胜利的事实本身，已经推翻了所谓在像俄国这种技术和经济落后的国家不可能建立社会主义的一切谰言；这是从资产阶级和社会民主党的思想的反动源泉借来的谰言。
    然而，不要忘记：倘使党对于这个胜利的可能性没有抱有深刻的信心，倘使党没有击溃自己队伍中的怀疑分子和动摇分子，倘使党在斯大林同志的领导下没有鼓舞和没有引导我国工人阶级跟随自己去勇敢地坚决地克服任何一切反列宁主义的动摇，去同阶级敌人及其在劳动者中以及在党本身内的代理人作不屈不挠的斗争，党就不可能取得这个胜利了。
    斯大林的领导的这一历史功绩，由于一件事实而有更重大的意义，这就是：这一历史功绩具有最伟大的国际意义，对于社会民主党怀疑社会主义能够取得胜利，给予了致命的打击；这种怀疑，是所有共产党在自己的队伍中也碰得到的。社会主义在我国的胜利，确凿地表明了：社会主义胜利的所谓“客观的前提”，早已在欧洲国家成熟了，而且还不仅仅是在欧洲国家成熟了；因此，坚决地克服资产阶级化了的社会民主党的官僚政治的反动影响，以及这种官僚政治对工人运动所带来的分裂，就是现在社会主义的一切忠诚拥护者的最主要任务。
    现在，人人都看到了：我国已经改造为社会主义国家；社会主义在苏联的胜利，为全国经济进一步更强大的发展，为苏联人民福利的稳步提高，保证了一切条件，国际形势也已经在许多方面，发生了有利于社会主义和人民民主的变化。许多百万苏联人民，在苏维埃政权的年代中，在自己的文化发展上，已大踏步前进；现在，他们正友爱地积极地参加着城市和乡村的社会主义建设，对自己事业的正义性，满怀着伟大的认识，对斯大林的英明领导，满怀着深刻的信心。在巩固社会主义制度以及对苏联人民进行社会主义再教育的事业上，我们正顺利地前进着。这表现在苏维埃社会的道德和政治之统一的增长上，表现在苏维埃爱国主义的高涨上，以致现在在世界上，没有什么力量能够使我们的人民倒退，再回到资本主义去。
    这就是我国在布尔什维克党的斯大林领导下，所经历的社会主义发展道路的光荣总结。
    至于苏联同其他国家的关系，以及整个国际形势，那么，在这方面，在最近的年代中，发生了重要的变化。
    不久以前，苏联还仍然是处于敌对资本主义包围中的唯一的社会主义国家。人人都知道，帝国主义列强曾经采取了多少次企图，以求用直接的武装干涉、经济封锁以及种种卑劣手段，包括制造阴谋和暗杀苏维埃活动家，暗中破坏和声东击西，来消灭第一个社会主义国家。保证苏联和平发展的外部条件，曾经是苏维埃政权对外政策所面临的基本任务。这曾经也要求经常地警惕地关心于加强苏军的威力，并且要求苏军随时准备保卫国家不受攻击。在一九二一年到一九四一年的期间，我们的国家，奉行了独立的苏维埃对外政策，保证了自己发展的和平条件。这个事实，是斯大林的对外政策——和平政策的巨大成就。斯大林的对外政策，依靠着社会主义建设的胜利和国家威力的巩固，使我们有可能使战前的和平时期，变为和平的二十年，从而解决了使苏联变为强大的社会主义强国的任务；这个强国，光荣地通过了最近一次战争的一切考验。
    第二次世界大战，以苏联和同盟国家完全战胜法西斯主义侵略者而告结束。这次战争，引起了苏联人民所有力量的巨大努力，同时，也向全世界表明了我们国家的经济威力和苏联各族人民不可摧毁的团结，这种威力和团结，都是在战争以前的年代中，在党的斯大林领导下建立起来的。苏联人民以自己自我牺牲的斗争，“从法西斯匪帮手里拯救了欧洲的文明”（斯大林）。苏军以自己在这次战争中所造成的无比勋功，光耀了我们的祖国。斯大林同志在组织伟大的胜利中所起的特殊作用，是人人都知道的。
    为了组织胜利的事业，斯大林同志在政治上和经济上，直接亲自执掌了对全国的领导，正像他统率了全国的武装力量，亲自执掌了军事领导本身一样。这鼓舞了军队和全体人民，去作自我牺牲的英勇斗争。这保证了按照军事需要，迅速改建全国的经济。战争时期，在斯大林同志的直接领导下建立的庞大的苏军是根据斯大林军事科学的原则建立起来的，并且变成了精锐的现代化军队。这一切，就使我们有可能造成战争进程的根本转变，并且保证了胜利地实现粉碎敌人的斯大林战略计划。开辟欧洲第二战线的迟延，使全世界明白了：在欧洲和后来在远东战胜法西斯主义所产生的荣誉，首先是属于苏军及其无双的斯大林领导的。这个有全世界历史意义的胜利，光耀了我们的国家、苏军及其伟大的指挥员——约瑟夫·维萨里奥诺维奇·斯大林。
    同时，大家也都知道，苏联、美国、英国及它们的其他盟国，组成反法西斯主义的联盟，在粉碎“轴心”国武装力量的事业上，曾经起了何等重要的作用。斯大林的对外政策，在第二次世界大战以前的时期，防止了资本主义国家反苏统一战线的建立。由于有斯大林的对外政策，侵略性的法西斯国家，陷入了孤立的地位，而苏联则在强大的反法西斯联盟中，占得了应有的地位。在这里，斯大林同志个人的作用，对于事件的全部进程，是有特殊的意义的。对各国人民历史方面的深湛知识，国际共产主义运动领袖的多方面的经验，洞悉和及时地猜透各国战略计划和策略路数的本领，解决复杂国际事务的果敢和灵活，都是斯大林同志的特色，这些特色，就决定了苏联对外政策的决定性的成就。
    为了在战争时期建立反希特勒的三强联盟，应当先行瓦解英法政府与替它们撑腰的帝国主义集团的反苏计划；这些计划的目的，是要推动德国同苏联作战，然后牺牲它们，尤其是牺牲苏联，从而获得渔利。当一种情况已经最后弄清楚了的时候，苏联甚至不得不同德国缔结互不侵犯协定。这种情况就是：为了对抗“轴心”国家成长了的法西斯侵略，苏联政府在与其他欧洲国家建立统一战线事业上的一切努力，由于英法政府盲目地仇视苏维埃工农国家，而被它们破坏了。斯大林同志及时地猜透了当时英法反苏阴谋的诡诈意图，这不仅使我们国家摆脱了打击，延缓了希特勒德国对苏联的进攻，而且使事件的发展走向了一种情况，在这种情况下，英美政府被迫而面临建立英苏美反法西斯联盟的必要性，从而符合了一切爱好自由人民的利益。
    由于第二次世界大战以及苏联的作用增长而在国际形势上引起的变化，是足够明显的。
    首先可以证明这一点的，是这样的事实：在欧洲和亚洲，成立了一系列的人民民主国家；它们现在有信心地走上了社会主义建设的道路。只有绝望的反动派，才会在我们的时代，沉溺在一种荒唐的空想中，这就是想使波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、阿尔巴尼亚或朝鲜的人民，更不用说蒙古人民共和国，回到旧的条件去，回到地主和资产阶级的驯服奴隶的地位去。不可以不承认中华人民共和国的成立的世界意义。中华人民共和国炸毁了帝国主义在亚洲的根基。为伟大的中国人民，已经开辟了走向自由和幸福的道路，而且尤其重要的是，他们现在有了自己的可靠的领导者——中国共产党。斯大林同志用下列轰动全世界的话语，确定了德意志民主共和国建立的伟大意义：德意志民主的爱好和平的共和国的成立，是欧洲历史的转折点。无可怀疑，爱好和平的民主的德国与爱好和平的苏联的并肩存在，使得欧洲不再有新战争的可能，结束欧洲的流血并使世界帝国主义奴役欧洲国家成为不可能。
    在现在的条件下，维护和平和民主事业的一切人民民主国家，同苏联处在一个阵营中。苏联以及人民民主国家，是和帝国主义的渴望与掠夺政策无缘分的。和它们有切身利害关系的，是对自己的获得了自由的人民，保证巩固的和平生活条件，并且保证与他国人民建立友好与平等的关系。
    然而，我们不应当忘记，也存在着另一个阵营。
    虽然第二次世界大战是十分不久以前才结束的，但帝国主义国家，并且首先是英美统治集团，却又在忙于狂热地准备新战争。它们为怀疑自己国内力量的心情所萦绕，正在拟订一个又一个新的侵略计划，扩大自己的军事预算，建立军事基地以及军事攻击同盟与集团，从而暴露了帝国主义列强的现行政策，对于各国人民的和平生活有多么大的危险；这个政策，产生着用包括原子战争在内的任何侵略手段，来统治世界的种种冒险计划。
    可是，时代已经不同了。
    另外一个有重大意义的事实就是：全地球的人民，为巩固和平而斗争的积极性提高了，同时，日益觉悟到空洞的和平主义愿望，是保证不了持久和平的。遍及一切国家的拥护和平运动，是各国人民渴望全世界和平的最明显表现之一。这个运动，有成亿的体力劳动者和脑力劳动者参加，包罗着一切民主的工会，以及战后建立的妇女、青年、文化工作者的好几百万民主团体。大家知道，整个保卫和平、民主和进步的广泛运动，把苏联看作是自已的主要支柱和希望，而斯大林的名字，就是这个运动的伟大的旗帜。
    从这些事实看来，共产党和工人党在许多国家中增长着的作用，是可以理解的。它们作为马列主义的党，虽然有反动政府方面的一切迫害和选举阴谋，依然在成长着，并且在思想上巩固着。在战争时期，共产党员在人民群众中的威信空前提高了，因为从共产党员当中，出现了最能自我牺牲的反法西斯主义的战士，为各族人民的权利与自由而斗争的战士。现在，任何一个政府，只要它关心它在自己人民中的真正威信，是不能不重视共产主义思想在人民群众中的影响的巨大增长的。大家都知道，铁托集团为了窃取南斯拉夫政权，也曾经假装是苏联的朋友，并且戴上了共产党员的假面具。然而，铁托叛徒集团变成了为外国帝国主义政府服务的、雇佣的暗杀者和间谍的匪帮，它的敌视苏联和本国人民的计划，已经被揭穿了。它遭受帝国主义反动派的奴才的可耻命运的时期，已在不远。
    这一切意味着，在第二次世界大战以后，国际力量的部署，发生了严重的变化。
    以前的情况是，唯一的社会主义国家——苏联，处于资本主义世界的包围中。代替这种情况而产生的新情况是，苏联走出了在国际上孤立的地位。不能不承认这是斯大林的领导的最伟大成就。在我们的时代，苏联在保卫全世界和平的事业中，不是孤独者。人民民主国家以及全部现在已经建立的整个国际拥护和平阵营，同苏联一起，维护着这个事业。两个阵营已经形成了：以苏联为首的民主阵营，它在反对新战争挑拨者的斗争中，维护着普遍的、持久的和平；与民主阵营对立的，是以美英统治集团为首的帝国主义阵营，它施行着准备新战争的政策，但无能力阻止国际拥护和平运动的日益高涨。
    因此，情况就变成这样：帝国主义者们，如果发动了新的世界大战，将不可避免地引起爱好和平的各国人民和整个民主阵营的普遍回击，这个回击，不会仅仅将使某些侵略强国失败，像前此时期一样，而是将使整个世界帝国主义的体系消灭。
    这就是国际形式变化的主要总结，国际形势的变化表明了：在现在，爱好和平人民的命运和全体进步人类的利益，是与公认的领袖——伟大的斯大林所领导的苏联和世界民主阵营的进一步成就，不可分地相联系的。
    斯大林全集，包括从一九○一年开始的作品，现在正在出版着。这一出版工作的理论的和政治的意义，是估计不完的。
    伟大的斯大林的天才创作，以它的全部多样性与精神财富，在我们眼前一个阶段接一个阶段如图画一样展现着。在这里，以马列主义思想的光芒，照明了布尔什维克党与国际共产主义运动的各种各样实际工作问题，以及历史与哲学的复杂学术问题；解释了对内政策与对外政策的最尖锐问题，苏联经济的根本问题，以及资本主义世界各国的各个发展阶段；揭发了有各种民族形式的社会主义文化的重大问题的本质；同时，也指明了苏维埃政权不止一次面临着的军事问题的意义。从苏维埃政权建立的初年起，在保卫我们祖国不受外部敌人的侵犯方面，以及在彻底实现苏联的和平政策上，斯大林同志个人的特殊作用，也是可以理解的。苏联的和平政策，过去一直是、而且现在仍然还是苏联对外政策的主要任务。此外，还有可以证明我们党及其斯大林领导的历史事业伟大性的许多其他事情。
    作为创造性的马克思主义的伟大代表，斯大林同志在许多方面，发挥了我们党的战略与策略的列宁主义原则。这对于各国的共产主义运动，具有特殊重大的意义。在这里，首先应该说社会主义在个别国家取得胜利的问题；这个问题，首先是列宁提出的，而在斯大林同志的著作中，得到了深刻的科学说明。斯大林同志以马列主义思想，阐明了和从理论上发挥了党与苏维埃国家所曾经面临的其他大问题，其中包括，例如：共产党作为新型的革命政党，并且尤其是党在无产阶级专政制度中的领导作用问题；苏联的社会主义工业化，及其对于巩固苏维埃国家的决定性的意义；成百万农场的集体化，以及最后一个剥削阶级——富农阶级的消灭，作为完成对我国整个国民经济基础的社会主义改造；在资本主义包围的条件下全力巩固社会主义国家的问题，以及国家消灭的条件问题；资产阶级民主革命阶段的民族问题与社会主义革命条件下的民族殖民地问题，并且尤其是社会主义民族的问题，以及当代的许多其他最重大的问题。在斯大林的科学著作中，对于这些问题以及其他问题的研究，在当前的条件下，不仅对苏联，而且对其他国家，是有最伟大的紧要意义的，这里所说的其他国家，尤其是指走上社会主义道路或进行民族解放战争的国家。
    与此同时，不可以忘记，无论在什么最完全的全集中，关于斯大林同志鼓舞着我们党和苏联人民的那种巨大的劳动，是找不到足够的反映的。斯大林同志每天用这种劳动，来提出新问题，制定我们社会主义建设的一切新的、愈来规模愈宏大的计划，拟就党与政府的最重要的指示，包括主要的外交文件，以及组织已通过的决议之实际实现的种种事务等等，如果不是这样，斯大林领导的真实规模与在思想上的意义，就不可能说明了。
    作为不朽的列宁的事业之伟大的继承者，斯大林同志是我们整个社会主义建设的领袖。他团结着苏联各民族的大家庭，指导着城市与乡村的劳动者去达到一个共同的伟大目标，动员着共产党员与非党分子在我国完成建立共产主义的任务，鼓舞着全世界工人阶级与被压迫民族从事斗争。斯大林的领导，浸透了对布尔什维克党、苏维埃国家、我们整个事业的历史使命的责任感。不管对什么人，不论其过去的功绩如何，进行批判的检查；坚定地发展布尔什维克的自我批评；对阶级敌人及其尚活着的走狗的任何进击，抱有不懈怠的警惕性；提拔思想上坚强的与在工作中受过考验的新干部，以及协助有才能的青年的发展；全力展开社会主义竞赛以及广大群众积极参加共产主义建设的任何其他方式，同时，实行提高苏联人民文化水平与共产主义教育的一切新措施——这就是我们党的斯大林领导的最强有力的方面。有历史意义的种种事实表明了：党在斯大林同志的领导下，一直是成功地解决了和解决着这些战斗任务的。
    斯大林同志在一九二三年所写的“论俄国共产党员的战略与策略问题”这一篇杰出的文章中，明确地定下了我们革命史上的三个历史转折点，以及我们党的三个与之相适应的战略计划。关于第三个转折点，也是最后一个转折点，斯大林同志写道：
    “第三个转折点，是从十月革命开始的：当时，西方两个帝国主义集团的生死决斗，已经达到了最高点；欧洲的革命危机，明显地成熟了；破产了的与在矛盾中弄昏头脑了的俄国资产阶级政权，在无产阶级革命的打击下垮台了；胜利了的无产阶级革命，与帝国主义决裂了，退出了战争，发觉了西方帝国主义联盟是不共戴天的仇人；新的苏维埃政府关于媾和的法令，关于没收地主土地、剥夺资本家的财产与解放被压迫民族的法令，博得了全世界成百万劳动者的信任？这是一个国际规模的转折点，因为国际的资本阵线，第一次被突破了，推翻资本主义的问题，第一次得到了实际的基础。这就使十月革命，从民族的、俄国的力量，变成了国际的力量，使俄国的工人，从国际无产阶级的一支落后部队，变成了它的先锋队，用自己自我牺牲的斗争，唤醒着西方的工人与东方的被压迫国家。这个转折点，还没有达到它的最后的发展，因为它还没有在国际规模上展开，可是，它的内容与总方向，是已经足够明显地确定了。”（见斯大林全集第五卷第一七八——一七九页）
    斯大林的这些话语的深刻意义与预言性质，我们是可以理解的。同时，人人现在都看见了：我们的国家前进了多么远；从那时候起，正是在像斯大林同志所写的那个意义上，国际形势有过了多么严重的变化。这在我们的日子，尤其明显：苏联作为社会主义取得了胜利的、在政治、经济与文化各方面有伟大高涨的国家，正在和与它友好的人民民主国家一道，有信心地前进着；与此同时，资本主义国家，无论大小，都愈来愈丧失对明天的信心，找不见逃脱成长中的经济矛盾与政治矛盾的出路，经受着一个又一个新的经济灾祸。
    在资本主义国家里，自流性经济发展的盲目规律，居于统治地位，操纵一切，而同时，周期性的经济危机不可避免地到来，社会敌对现象的尖锐化日益增大。苏维埃国家，与资本主义国家不同；它是在完全另一种基础上建立起来的。在我们国家里，由于社会主义革命以及随之而来的消灭剥削阶级，使整个国民经济具有了有计划的高涨，这是任何一个资本主义国家所不能企望的。在苏联，不仅实现了按照统一的发展计划而组织起来的全国经济生活的高涨，并且社会生活的其他各方面，也具有计划性，其目的是要加速苏联各族人民文化的一般的全面的高涨，是要提高和发展科学与艺术。只有从这方面着眼，才能了解苏联科学与技术的日益增长的成就，包括在掌握原子能方面的著名成绩，这种成绩，使苏联的一切敌人那样惊愕而困惑。与伪科学展开的斗争在原则上和实践上的深刻意义，一天比一天多地显露出来了。在苏联，这个斗争是由以唯物主义辩证法武装了的科学工作者进行着的。我们的文学与艺术，愈来愈成为我们斯大林时代的旗手，在许多方面，助成着苏联人民的成绩，鼓舞着他们去劳动和斗争，并且将苏联的影响远远地散播在祖国之外。
    其他任何一个国家，还未曾有过这样宏大的成绩。资产阶级的局限的眼光，是根本了解不了这种规模的问题的。只有强固起来了的社会主义社会，才能承担得起这种事务，对全国的经济生活与文化生活的各方面，提出指导性的科学原则，从而非常成功地增加着我们的力量，并且使苏联驾乎资本主义阵营的任何国家之上。这也就是苏联的道德与政治的威信，在全地球各族人民之间空前高涨的原因。
    党曾经不得不解决这些伟大的任务，并不是偶然的。党给与了我国人民与全人类以像列宁与斯大林这种伟大的领袖——理论思想与革命事业的巨人。如果说在列宁逝世以后，苏联人民胜利地解决了自己对内与对外的战略任务与策略任务，使自己的国家这样强有力，同时，在精神上也与全世界的劳动者这样亲近，那么，在这方面，最伟大的历史功绩，首先是属于我们党的伟大领袖斯大林同志的，是属于斯大林的领导的。
    这就说明了为什么我国的劳动者，对英明的斯大林的领导有这样无限的信任，为什么他们这样强烈地信仰斯大林的天才，为什么苏联人民与全世界的劳动者，对斯大林同志有这样巨大的热爱。
    今天，在他七十寿辰的日子，为了我国人民的福利和光荣，为了全体进步人类的幸福，我们再三再四地祝伟大的亲爱的斯大林，我们的领袖、导师与朋友身体健康和长生不老。
