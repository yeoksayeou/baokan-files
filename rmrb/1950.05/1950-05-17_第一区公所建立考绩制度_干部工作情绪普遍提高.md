　　The First District Public Office Establishes a Performance Appraisal System
　　Cadre Morale Generally Improves
[Our Newspaper] The First District Public Office of Beijing Municipality began implementing a performance appraisal system for its staff in January, and has achieved preliminary results in the past four months. The district's performance appraisal system was proposed on the basis of summarizing work and evaluating cadres at the end of 1949, with the aim of consolidating existing achievements and further overcoming the passive, chaotic, and bureaucratic styles of work in the past. After the formal proposal to implement the performance appraisal system was put forward at the first administrative meeting in January, it was followed by communication and mobilization among the Party and Youth League members and all cadres. Five levels of appraisal were stipulated: progressing, significantly progressing, minor merit, major merit, and model, and four conditions: 1. Formulating and completing individual work plans on time; 2. Being proactive and responsible; 3. Implementing the reporting system well; 4. Working hard to study. In this way, as long as cadres work hard, they have the opportunity to be evaluated. When a summary was made in March, objective circumstances broke through the five levels, and two more items were added: "achieved results" and "achieved significant results." At that time, one person was rated as having achieved results, two people were rated as having achieved significant results, nine people were rated as progressing, one person was rated as significantly progressing, and one person was rated as having made significant progress and achieved results. All those who were selected received the support of the masses, and the leadership also prepared items such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, towels, soap, and diaries for separate rewards. In the past four months, cadre morale has been high, and many cadres have made significant progress in their work and thinking. Wang Jinchen, of the Mediation Section, was not only evaluated as "progressing" (January), "minor merit" (February), and "significantly progressing and achieving results" (March) due to his hard work, but also led Liu Tianlin, a retained employee, to be evaluated as progressing in February. Zhang Hanqi, a correspondent, has transformed from being carefree and disliked by everyone to being proactive and responsible; his relationship with cadres and the masses is also closer than before. Liu Rong, a dispatcher who often had emotional problems and was not easily receptive to criticism, is now much more down-to-earth and humble. The staff of each section have stepped out of their offices and attached importance to investigation and research. In conjunction with the implementation of the performance appraisal system, the Party branch developed three new Party members in March (one has been approved by the First District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing). The Youth League branch developed two new Youth League members. Based on the results of the performance appraisal, the administrative leadership promoted a group of cadres in May. Four clerks were promoted to staff members with the approval of the municipal government. Three probationary cadres who assisted in the work were confirmed as formal cadres (two staff members and one clerk). (First District Public Office)

　　第一区公所建立考绩制度
　　干部工作情绪普遍提高
    【本报讯】北京市第一区公所，于一月份开始实行对工作人员的考绩制度，四个多月以来，已获得初步成绩。该区的考绩制度，是在一九四九年年底总结工作、鉴定干部的基础上提出来的，目的是巩固已有的成绩及进一步克服过去工作上被动、忙乱及官僚主义作风。在一月份的第一次行政会议上正式提出实行考绩制度后，接着在党团及全体干部中进行了传达动员。并规定了考绩的五个等级，即有进步、有显著进步、小功、大功、模范，和四个条件：一、按时制订、完成个人工作计划；二、积极负责；三、请示报告制度执行得好；四、努力学习。这样，只要干部努力，即有被评选的机会。三月进行小结的时候，客观情况又冲破了五个等级，又增加了有成绩和有显著成绩两项。当时，被评为有成绩者一人，有显著成绩者二人，有进步者九人，有显著进步者一人，有显著进步又有成绩者一人。所有被评选者都受到了群众的拥护，领导上也置备了牙刷、牙膏、毛巾、肥皂、日记本等物品，分别进行奖励。四个多月以来，干部情绪是饱满的，不少干部在工作、思想各方面，都有显著进步。调解科的王荩臣，不但因工作努力，三个月来被评为“有进步”（一月），“小功”（二月），“有显著进步又有成绩”（三月），在二月份还带动了留用人员齐天霖被评为有进步。通讯员张汉启由过去吊儿浪当，人人讨厌，转变成积极负责；跟干部和群众的关系也较前密切了。经常闹情绪、不易接受批评的收发员刘蓉，较前踏实虚心的多了。各科的工作人员，都走出了办公室，重视了调查研究。结合着考绩制度的进行，党的支部三月份发展了三个党员（一个已被中共北京市第一区区委会批准）。团的支部发展了两个团员。行政领导上根据考绩的结果，在五月份内提拔了一批干部。四个办事员经市府批准提为科员。三个帮助工作的试用干部，被确定为正式干部（两个科员，一个办事员）。（第一区区公所）
