Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: People in various parts of East China are enthusiastically launching a donation campaign to aid unemployed workers. Since the Shanghai General Labor Union issued the call for employed workers to donate one day's wages, labor unions from medical, military industrial, and municipal systems have paid their donations in the past two weeks. Many workers donated three to seven days' wages. Employed workers in printing, flour, department store, and textile industries have also decided to donate one day's wages. A donation upsurge among educators in the city has begun in some primary and secondary schools. Government personnel and garrison troops on the supply system are also saving one day's food expenses to help unemployed workers. In addition, the Shanghai Municipal Government has decided to allocate 1 billion RMB in advance for emergency relief. In Nanjing, more than 20 units have launched movements to donate one day's income. The 225 members of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company staff study class donated more than 1,600 discount units in wages. Although employed workers in Wuxi are also in difficult situations, they have donated 500 shi of rice in recent days to help unemployed workers in the city. More than 28,000 employees from more than 40 factories in Qingdao worked an extra day on April 30, donating all wages equivalent to more than 6,000 bags of flour. The 130 workers of Jinghua Glass Factory, which moved from Shanghai to Qingdao this spring, are particularly active in helping unemployed worker brothers solve their current difficulties. In addition to donating wages earned from working one extra day on the 30th, they have donated more than 800,000 yuan and six bags of flour. In addition, more than 3,300 workers and staff in railway, postal and telecommunications, financial departments, and porter and shop employee unions have donated more than 32 million yuan and more than 5,000 jin of grain and flour. In addition, Wuhu, Hangzhou, Jinhua, Fuzhou, Xiamen and other cities in East China have also carried out enthusiastic donation campaigns to help unemployed workers.
Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: As of the end of April, the People's Bank of China branches in Tianjin, Wuhan, Chongqing, and Dihua had received more than 400 million yuan in donations to relieve unemployed workers.
