　　Several Problems in Private Industry and Commerce in Xi'an
　　Special Correspondent Lin Wei

　　Xi'an is the largest city in Northwest China. The industry and commerce of Xi'an are representative of the Northwest.

　　Since March and April, with the decline and stabilization of prices, large flour and cloth merchants in Xi'an, who used to hoard large quantities of goods, manipulate the market, and threaten the lives of 600,000 people, have had to sell their stockpiled goods at low prices. The phenomenon of competing to purchase goods, which had existed for more than ten years, has stopped. Private money shops that made fortunes by relying on usury and speculation, cosmetics businesses that catered exclusively to bureaucrats and compradors and were irrelevant to the vast majority of the people, Western restaurants, Western clothing stores, etc., have either closed down or lost business. The situation for manufacturers of superstitious items and luxury items such as tobacco and alcohol is similar. On the other hand, some industries and businesses needed for the national economy and the people's livelihood have also temporarily fallen into difficult situations for the following reasons:

　　First, there is overproduction. Taking the flour industry as an example, the city's flour mills can produce 6.55 million bags of flour a year, but the actual need in Xi'an is only 2.7 million bags. In the past, because the Chiang Kai-shek/Hu Zongnan bandit troops were concentrated in the Xi'an area, the demand for flour was extremely high. Xi'an merchants and ordinary citizens alike used flour as an important object for hoarding and saving. In the early days of liberation, prices continued to fluctuate, and people still stored goods instead of currency, so the phenomenon of flour overproduction was never apparent. Now that prices have fallen, large quantities of stored flour have flooded the market, and the problem has become serious. The price of flour has dropped from 120,000-130,000 to just over 40,000 per bag, but it still cannot be sold.

　　The depression of the clothing and daily necessities manufacturing industries also reflects the same problem. The city has as many as 569 clothing manufacturers, which is also an abnormal phenomenon that arose to meet the large military needs during the Hu bandit's rule. Now that demand has decreased, these industries naturally have no sales outlets.

　　In response to this situation, it is now urgent to actively organize some of the most struggling factories to switch industries, such as organizing smaller flour mills to move to larger towns in wheat-producing areas.

　　Second, the sluggish sales of some products are temporary. The reason is not overproduction, but because people temporarily have some savings, are still taking a wait-and-see attitude towards prices, and are unwilling to buy. For example, even if all the textile industry's power and manual looms in Xi'an were fully operational, they could only weave just over one million bolts of cloth a year, which is still far from the actual need. In the past, the Northwest could not only sell cloth woven in the Xi'an area, but also many cloths from Shanghai. In the future, according to normal needs, cloth from other provinces will still be needed. For this kind of clearly promising production business, especially the production of Yanta cloth, which has a fairly good technical level, if the government's industrial and commercial trade agencies provide timely assistance through methods such as purchasing finished products or entrusting processing and ordering goods, they can still maintain a certain price level and maintain continued production. The phenomenon that the price of cloth in Xi'an is lower than or equal to the price of cloth in Shanghai is unreasonable. The price ratio between yarn and cloth is also showing an unreasonable phenomenon now. Previously, one piece of yarn in Xi'an could be exchanged for 25 or 26 bolts of cloth, but now it can only be exchanged for just over 19 bolts, which is more than one-tenth away from the unified price ratio. The reason is that Xi'an has fewer weaving machines and a higher output of yarn, and both public and private sectors have considerable reserves. In addition, some state-owned trading companies in East China have also transported Qingdao yarn into Xi'an, so the price of yarn has fallen particularly sharply. These issues should be appropriately adjusted by the state's industrial and commercial trade agencies through the production and sales work of state-owned enterprises to make them more planned. Otherwise, it will not only be detrimental to certain production businesses that should be preserved, but it will also cause direct losses to state-owned trading agencies. In addition, the Zhongnan Match Factory in Xi'an is also a factory with modern technical levels (comparable to Qingdao), and it can be preserved if it is properly supported.

　　Third, while adopting the above-mentioned methods, it is necessary to help private factories that should be preserved and developed to carry out reforms in business management, streamline institutions, adjust employees, improve labor-management relations, and improve labor efficiency and product quality to reduce costs. In early February of this year, the Dahua Yarn Factory consumed an average of 3,890 pounds of cotton waste, reclaimed cotton, reclaimed strips, coarse and fine yarn ends, roller waste, and oil waste per day, exceeding the normal consumption by 44.6 percent. Other waste and anarchic phenomena were also extremely shocking. Recently, with the help of the municipal government working group to establish various democratic management systems and adjust labor-management relations, the average output in March increased by 36.8 percent compared to early February, raw material waste decreased by 7.7 percent, the rate of defective cloth decreased by 14 percent, the labor required for each piece of yarn decreased by 6.5 percent, and the labor required for each bolt of cloth decreased by 15 percent. Coal consumption for power generation in March decreased by 25 tons compared to January, and general miscellaneous expenses decreased by more than 10,000 conversion units. The savings in food for the whole month (reducing leftover food) was enough for all 3,350 people in the factory to eat grain for eight days. As a result, the factory's profit in March reached more than 500 million yuan. The Zhongnan Match Factory is also implementing reforms under the leadership and assistance of the Municipal People's Government and trade agencies, and has achieved considerable results.

　　In addition, it is necessary to vigorously organize and develop the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas in order to enable industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood to continue to operate. The current situation in the Northwest is: on the one hand, a large number of farmers and herdsmen are making fire by striking stones, and on the other hand, a large number of matches cannot be sold in cities. On the one hand, many farmers and herdsmen do not have cloth to make clothes, and on the other hand, a large number of cloths are experiencing sluggish sales in cities. To solve this problem, fundamentally speaking, it is necessary to implement land reform, develop rural productive forces, and increase purchasing power. But before land reform is carried out, there are also some things that can be done. This includes two aspects: First, to organize the purchase of local and special products such as wool, pig bristles, and medicinal materials from rural areas, so that these items, which are being wasted in large quantities due to lack of buyers, can be exported to earn foreign exchange; at the same time, it increases the purchasing power of rural areas, expands the scope of RMB circulation, and has a considerable effect on stabilizing financial prices. According to surveys, the annual output of wool in the Northwest is over 40 to 50 million catties. If all of this is transformed into farmers' purchasing power, it will have a great effect on the promotion of industrial products (the trade department is already making partial purchases). Second, to universally develop cooperatives in rural areas (it is not necessary to wait until after land reform to organize them), develop the peddling and retail sales of industrial products, and reduce the difficulty for farmers to purchase from afar, which can also increase the sales of certain products. At present, there are very few cooperatives in the Northwest; if they can be developed, they will not only sell the goods of trading companies, but also many goods of private industries and businesses. But to do this, it is necessary to change the profiteering mentality that has universally developed among some industrialists and businessmen during the war and inflationary periods. There are still some industrialists and businessmen who are attached to the past excess profits of 100 percent, or even 200 or 300 percent, and look down on normal profits of 10 or 20 percent, saying that this is "working for nothing" or "losing money." They must change their business strategy and implement small profits and quick sales. Manual iron, textile, and leather industries should be appropriately relocated to rural areas to manufacture various farm tools and weave cloth needed by farmers.

　　西安私营工商业中的几个问题
    本报特派记者　林韦
    西安是西北第一个大城市。西安的工商业，在西北是有代表性的。
    三、四月份以来，随着物价的回落与稳定，西安市过去经常大量囤积物资，操纵市场、威胁着六十万人民生活的大面粉商、纱布商，都不得不贱价抛售过去囤积的物资；十多年来一直存在着的争购物资现象停止了；过去依靠高利贷和投机而发财的私人银钱业、专供官僚买办们享受而与广大人民无关的化装品业、西餐业、西服店等，有的关了门，有的没了生意。迷信品制造业与烟酒奢侈品业，情形也差不多。另一方面，有些为国计民生所需的工商业，也因下述各种原因暂时陷入困难的局面：
    第一、是生产过剩。以面粉业为例：全市粉厂一年能产粉六五五万袋，但西安市实际需要不过二七○万袋。过去因蒋胡匪军云集西安一带，需粉量极大；西安商人与一般市民又均以面粉为重要的囤积与储蓄对象；解放初期，物价仍一直波动，人们还是存货不存币，所以从未显出面粉生产过剩的现象。现在物价一落，大量存粉拥入市场，问题就严重地暴露出来了，面粉每袋从十二、三万一直落到四万多，还是卖不掉。
    服装与日用品制造业的萧条，也反映着同一问题。全市服装制造业多至五百六十九家，也是适应胡匪统治时期大量军队需要而发生的畸形现象。现在需要减少，这些行业自然没有销路。
    针对这种情况，目前急须主动地组织一些最困难的工厂转业，如组织较小的粉厂迁向各产麦区的较大市镇等。
    第二，有些生产品的滞销是暂时性的。原因不是生产过多，而是由于人们暂时有点积蓄，对物价还抱着观望态度，不肯购买。比如西安的布匹，即使将所有纺织业的电力与人力织机全部转动起来，一年也不过能织一百多万匹，离实际需要还远。过去西北不仅能销售西安一带织出的布，还能销售许多上海来的布。将来按照正常的需要，也还需要外省来的布。对于这类显然有前途的生产事业，特别是技术水准相当好的雁塔布之类的生产，政府的工商贸易机关如果及时的收购成品或委托加工、订货等办法加以帮助，仍能维持一定的价格水平，保持继续生产。目前西安布价低于或等于上海布价的现象是不合理的。纱与布的比价，现在也发生不合理现象。以前西安一件纱能换二十五、六匹布，现只能换十九匹多，离统一比价还相差十分之一以上。原因是西安织机少而纱的产量多，公私都有相当存量；又加上华东有的公营贸易公司又将青岛纱运入西安，故纱价跌落特剧。这些，应该经过国家的工商贸易机关适当调整公营企业的生产与运销工作，使其更有计划性。否则不仅是对某些应该保存的生产事业不利，而且会使国家贸易机关也受到直接损失。此外，西安的中南火柴厂，也是具有近代技术水平的工厂（可与青岛相比），如果适当扶助是可以保存下去的。
    第三，与采取上述办法同时，要帮助应该保存发展的私营工厂进行经营管理上的改革，紧缩机构，调整职工，改善劳资关系，提高劳动效率与产品质量，以减低成本。大华纱厂今年二月上旬，每天平均消耗、回花、回条、粗细纱头、皮棍花、油花等三千八百九十磅，超出正常消耗量百分之四四·六。其他浪费与无政府现象也极惊人。近经市府工作组帮助建立各种民主的管理制度，调整劳资关系后，三月份平均产量即较二月上旬增加百分之三六·八，原料浪费减少百分之七·七，次布率减少百分之十四，每件纱所用人工减少百分之六·五，每匹布所用人工减少百分之十五，三月份发电用煤较一月减少二十五吨，总务杂支减少一万多折实单位，全月伙食上的节省（减少剩饭剩菜）够全厂三三五○人八天吃粮。这样，该厂三月份获利即达五亿余元。中南火柴厂也在市人民政府与贸易机关领导帮助下实行改革，并已获得相当成绩。
    此外，还必须大力组织与发展城乡物资交流，才能使现在有益于国计民生的工商业继续维持。西北目前的情况是：一方面大量农牧民在打石取火，一方面城市中有大量火柴卖不出去。一方面许多农牧民没布做衣服，一方面城市中有大量布匹发生滞销现象。要解决这个问题，从根本上说，需要实行土地改革，发展农村生产力与提高购买力。但在未进行土地改革以前，也有若干可做的工作。这里包括两个方面：一、有组织地收购农村中的羊毛、猪鬃、药材等土产特产，使这些因无人收购而大量糟踏着的物品得以出口，换取外汇；同时也增加了农村的购买力，扩大了人民币流通范围，对稳定金融物价有相当作用。据调查，西北羊毛年产在四、五千万斤以上。如果都变成农民的购买力，对工业产品的推销是有很大作用的（现贸易部门已在作部分的收购）。二、在农村普遍发展合作社（并不一定要等到土地改革后才能组织），发展工业品的担挑零卖，减少农民远道购买的困难，也可增大若干产品的销路。现在西北合作社还很少；如能发展起来，并不只是销售贸易公司的商品，同样能销售许多私营工商业的商品。但要想这样作，必须改变某些工商业家在战争环境及通货膨胀时期普遍发展起来的暴利思想。现在还有一些工商业家恋念着过去百分之百，甚至百分之二百、三百的超额利润，看不起一成二成的正常利润，说这叫做“白干”或“赔钱”。他们必须转变经营方针，实行薄利多销。手工的铁业、纺织业、皮革业等，应该适当地向农村迁移，改制各种农具，改织农民所需要的布匹等。
