　　Zhengding Supply and Marketing Cooperative Fined for Tax Evasion
　　Merchants and Cadres Greatly Educated
    [Report from Zhengding] During the recent industrial and commercial tax collection period, the Zhengding Chengguan Tax Office investigated and dealt with cases of county and district supply and marketing cooperatives and government agency production units failing to pay taxes and evading stamp duties, providing education and imposing penalties as appropriate. In the past, tax office cadres believed that public enterprises would not conceal or evade taxes and only focused on inspecting private businesses. After the county bureau conveyed the spirit of the provincial bureau meeting, the cadres' work enthusiasm greatly increased, especially regarding the inspection of goods tax and stamp tax. On March 25th, it was discovered that the county supply and marketing cooperative was selling 1,378 bundles of foreign yarn, worth over 118.67 million yuan, without affixing stamps, and stamp duty of over 356,000 yuan was due. As this was not the first time the cooperative had failed to affix stamps, and even when they did, they did not pay on time, it was decided to order them to pay the taxes in accordance with the regulations and to impose a fine of twenty times the amount of tax evaded, totaling 7,120,300 yuan. Later, it was discovered that the Chengguan District Supply and Marketing Cooperative had been notified to register within a specified period and had been repeatedly urged to pay taxes (which they had not done) for 108 bundles of foreign yarn, as well as 20 dozens of towels, 4 reams of paper, and 8 catties of tea, which were sold publicly without paying taxes. In addition to paying taxes according to the regulations, a fine of 440,000 yuan was also imposed. The investigation and handling of these cases greatly educated many private merchants and changed their perception that public enterprises could evade taxes without being punished. For example, Li Qinshan, who sells foreign cloth, said: "I used to think that public enterprises could get away with breaking the law, but now public and private are the same. The policies are not only for private individuals; no one can break the law. We must abide by them." At the same time, it also deeply aroused the attention of the cadres, who recognized the prevalence of tax evasion in the past and that management must be strengthened in the future, and inspections must be carried out thoroughly.

　　正定供销社漏税被罚
　　商人和干部都受到很大教育
    【本报正定讯】正定城关税所在此次工商税征收期间，查获县区供销社与机关生产，未纳税货物与漏贴印花案件，都分别给予教育与处罚。该税所干部过去思想上认为公家企业不会隐匿逃税，只注意了对私商的检查。自县局传达省局会议精神后，干部工作情绪大大提高，尤其是对货物税、印花税的检查更加严密了。在三月廿五日查出县供销社有不贴印花，即行出售的洋纱计一千三百七十八捆，总值一亿一千八百六十七万余元，应贴印花三十五万六千余元。由于该社漏贴印花已非一次，纵贴亦不按期交款，因此，决定除令其照章补税外，并按章处以漏税额二十倍之罚金，共七百一十二万零三百元。后又查出城关区供销社，早经限期登记，并数次督促补税（未补）之洋纱一百零八捆，还有毛巾二十打、纸四刀、茶叶八斤未曾纳税，公然出卖，照章补税外，亦处以四十四万元之罚金。这些案件的查出及处理，给了不少私商很大教育，并使之对公家漏税不受处罚的认识得以改观。如卖洋布的李勤山说：“以前我认为公家犯了法没事，现在公家、私人都是一样，政策不是光给私人定的，谁犯法也不行，我们必须好好遵守”。同时也深深引起了干部的注意，认识以往漏税的普遍，今后必须加强管理，切实的深入检查。
