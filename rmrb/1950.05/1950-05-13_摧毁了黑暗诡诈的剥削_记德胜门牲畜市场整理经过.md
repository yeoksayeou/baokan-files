　　Destroying the Dark and Deceitful Exploitation
　　A Record of the Rectification of the Deshengmen Livestock Market
　　The Deshengmen outside Mule and Horse Market is the central location for mule and horse trading in Beijing, where suburban farmers buy and sell livestock. There are currently forty horse shops, and a total of over three hundred and eighty brokers and middlemen. They have all inherited this trade through generations, making a living with the "whip" since childhood, acting as agents for customers or buying and selling on their own account. In the past, when a deal was made, they would secretly signal with their hands in their sleeves and use coded language (such as "ke" for ten thousand, "men" for twenty thousand, "mi" for thirty thousand, etc.), employing various methods of deception, trickery, and fraud to exploit customers (mostly suburban farmers). There was a common saying in the area that horse traders "go hungry in the morning, but ride a horse at night," meaning that even if they were starving in the morning, they could earn enough to buy a horse with a single successful deal. After the liberation of Beijing, the People's Government, after careful study, decided to rectify this market. After organizing the businesses into groups and having them operate jointly, it seemed on the surface that things had become regularized, and the traders were shouting, "Absolutely no excessive commissions." In reality, the commissions they obtained through concealment and deception were higher than in any other market. After the People's Government staff went deep among the masses, discovered activists, and learned from experience, they gradually understood the various deceptive tactics of the traders. In two months, they uncovered more than thirty cases of violations, both large and small, and imposed punishments or education according to the severity of the offenses. In mid-December, two general meetings of all employees were held, deciding to eradicate the phenomenon of unlimited exploitation of customers and to ensure that tax revenue would not be lost. During the rectification period, a few lawless elements secretly gathered their colleagues and spread rumors such as "the government wants to abolish this industry," and even planned to go to the government to "petition," attempting to obstruct the reform with various methods in order to maintain their illegal exploitation. In addition to education and persuasion, the People's Government actively improved the market, stipulating that both buyers and sellers must be present to negotiate prices openly, and that commissions should not exceed five percent, with no other fees allowed under any pretext. Under mutual supervision, the general awareness of the traders has also improved, gradually putting the market's transactions on the right track, not only preventing the farmers from suffering losses but also ensuring that national tax revenue is not lost. Now, the following has been achieved: 1. Both parties negotiate prices face-to-face, no longer relying on secret hand signals from middlemen. 2. The traders must point out the defects of the livestock in person, and deceptive tactics can no longer be used. 3. There should be no exploitation other than commissions. 4. Employees can operate diligently. 5. Fights and quarrels in the market have decreased. 6. Due to strict management and regular education, the vast majority can persuade each other not to make mistakes. (Tax Work Bulletin Newspaper)

　　摧毁了黑暗诡诈的剥削
　  记德胜门牲畜市场整理经过
    德胜门外骡马市是北京骡马买卖集中地，郊区农民买卖牲畜都在这里。现有马店四十家，贩子、牙纪总计三百八十余人，他们均系世代相传，自幼即以“鞭杆”为生，他们代客或自行买卖。以前成交时，袖里捏手，口里黑话（如一万是“可”，二万是“门”，三万是“迷”等），用各种蒙骗、欺瞒、诡诈的办法，剥削客主（多系郊区农民）。该地曾有句俗话，说马行人“早晨挨饿，晚上骑马”，这意思是说别看他们早晨还挨着饿，只要捉住一下子，就可以赚匹马骑。北京解放后，人民政府经缜密研究，决定对此市场进行整理。经过按店业编成小组，合力经营后，当时从表面看来似已步入正规，交易员们也大喊“绝不多要佣金”，实际上，他们瞒蒙欺骗所获得的佣金，较任何市场都多。人民政府工作人员经深入群众，发现积极分子，吸取经验，渐渐了解了交易员的各种欺蒙手段，在两个月中，查出大小违章案件三十余件，分别轻重予以处罚或教育。又于十二月中旬，开了两次全体从业员大会，决定根除无限制剥削客主的现象；和保证税收不受损失。在整理期间，少数不法分子曾暗中集结同业，散布“政府要取消这个行业”等等的谣言，又要到政府去“请愿”，企图用各种方法阻碍改革，以保持他们的非法剥削。人民政府除给予教育说服外，同时积极进行市场的改进，规定买卖双方一定要在场公开讲价，佣金最高不得超过五分，此外不准以任何借口收取费用。交易员在互相监督下，一般的认识也较前提高，使市场的交易渐入正轨，不但老乡们不再吃亏，国家税收也免受损失。现在已作到：一、双方当面讲价，不再凭行中人捏手。二、牲口的残疾，由交易员当面指出，不能再用欺骗手法。三、除佣金外不得有剥削行为。四、从业人员都能兢兢业业的经营。五、市场上打架吵嘴的减少了。六、由于严格管理，经常教育，绝大多数都能彼此规劝，不犯错误。（税工通报小报）
