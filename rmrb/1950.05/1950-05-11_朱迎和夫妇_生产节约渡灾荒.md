    On the Yi River harnessing project in northern Jiangsu, there emerged the following story: In Laohuzhuang Village, Guzhai Township, Huaiyin County, there was a farmer named Zhu Yinghe who went to work on the Yi River and wasted his wages and food instead of bringing them home. His wife, Liu Lanying, wrote a criticism and suggestion, which was published in the local Huaihai Daily on April 10th. The content was:

    My husband, Zhu Yinghe, went to dig the river this time. Each family in our village sent back twenty or thirty catties of wage grain to survive the famine. I went to ask Village Chief Jiang Jinwen. Village Chief Jiang said that he sold twenty catties of sorghum on the river project to buy fried dough sticks. Husband, you are so wrong. At home, I rely on township relief and picking wild vegetables to eat; otherwise, I would starve to death. A wasteful person like you has really forgotten your roots. Have you forgotten the words of thrift I advised you with at home? I hope you must save well and send food back with others next time, so that I will also have face. And I hope the comrades in this township will give him a good education. (Liu Lanying, farmer of Laohuzhuang Village, Tiahe Village, Guzhai Township, Wenkexu District, Huaiyin County, written on her behalf by Cao Jianye)

    The Huaihai Daily was passed to Zhu Yinghe's labor group on the river project. Zhu Yinghe felt very uncomfortable when he heard the reading group read this criticism. He made a deep self-criticism and asked someone to write a reply to the criticism on his behalf, which was published in the Huaihai Daily on April 21st. The content was:

    Laborer Zhu Yinghe, replying to his wife's criticism:

    I, Zhu Yinghe, saw the criticism of me by my wife, Liu Lanying, in the newspaper on April 10th, and I am now deeply examining myself. Before I went to work, my wife Lanying and I planned to dig more soil and earn more grain to send home to survive the famine. But after going to work, I forgot about my family. In the first phase of settlement, everyone sent back twenty or thirty catties of grain, but not only did I, Zhu Yinghe, not send my wages home, but I sold ten or twenty catties of wage grain to buy fried dough sticks. Lanying criticized me in the newspaper, and I felt very uncomfortable. After examining myself, I made up my mind to dig more earth, earn more grain, and save more, guaranteeing that I would not waste anything except for the two catties and twelve taels of food I eat every day. In the second and third phases of settlement, I earned one hundred catties of wage grain and sent it home to survive the famine. Lanying! I propose production and famine relief suggestions to you: You must plant spring crops in a timely manner at home, and do not be too careless in your daily work, and still dig more wild vegetables. Lanying! I also know that you usually do a lot of work, so you must do your work well. Our husband and wife should produce and save together! I will work hard to dig the earth, guaranteeing that I will have food for spring hoeing and summer harvest when I return home to work. (Farmer Zhu Yinghe, written on his behalf by Yang Ganqun and Qin Huaishi)

　　生产节约渡灾荒

    在苏北导治沂河工程上，出现了这样一个故事：淮阴县古寨乡老虎庄有个农民朱迎和，他上沂河做工，得了工资粮不带回家，浪费掉了。他的老婆刘兰英，写了一篇批评与建议，登在当地四月十日的淮海报上，内容是：
    我的丈夫朱迎和，这次去扒河，我们庄上各家都寄回来二三十斤工资粮渡荒。我去问问蒋锦文村长，蒋村长说，他在河工上卖了二十斤秫秫吃油条。丈夫，你是太不对了。我在家里，亏的乡里救济和挑菜吃，不然就要饿死了。象你这样不节约浪费的人，真忘本了。在家我劝你节约的话你忘记了吗？我希望你一定要好好节省，下次和人家一齐寄粮食回来，我脸上也有光彩。并希望本乡同志对他好好教育。（淮阴县文科区古寨乡条河村老虎庄农民刘兰英，代笔曹建业）
    淮海报传到河工上朱迎和的民工小组里去了。朱迎和听见读报组里读这条批评，心里非常难受。自己做了深刻的检讨，并且请人代笔写了一篇答复批评，登在四月二十一日的淮海报上，内容是：
    民工朱迎和，答复老婆的批评：
    我朱迎和在四月十日，看到报纸上我妻刘兰英批评我，我现在深刻的检讨。我在家未上工时，与妻兰英计划，上河工多挖土多挣粮寄回家渡荒。可是到工后忘记了家庭，头期收方，人家每人都寄回二、三十斤粮食，我朱迎和的工资不但不寄回家，反而卖了一二十斤工资粮买油条吃。兰英在报上批评我，我心里非常难受。我经过检讨后下定决心，多挖土方多挣粮多节约，保证每天除二斤十二两吃粮外，不浪费。在二、三两期收方时，挣工资粮一百斤，寄回家渡荒。兰英！我向你提出生产渡荒的意见：你在家春种要及时，过日月不要太撒，仍要多挖野菜。兰英！你平时做活我也知道的，要好好做活，我们夫妻齐生产，齐节约！我下劲挖土，保证回家春锄、夏收，到做活时有口粮。（农民朱迎和，代笔杨干群、秦怀诗）
