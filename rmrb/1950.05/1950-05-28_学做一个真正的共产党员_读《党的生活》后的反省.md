　　Learning to Be a True Communist Party Member
　　——Reflections After Reading "Party Life"
　　Yang Zeng

　　On the afternoon of May 9th, I returned from a communications work meeting in the regiment and was about to rest when I saw the People's Daily for that day on the table. Opening the newspaper, the title of the "Party Life" column on page three, "Guo Village Branch Guarantees Full Seedling Emergence," immediately caught my attention. I am from Guo Village, and this article is about my village.

　　Village Chief Guo Linzhou (branch committee member) is my old comrade-in-arms from the Anti-Japanese War. Yang Yunqi, a militiaman who drafted a plan to mobilize his family and seven neighbors to plant more cotton, and Zhang Pinglu, who regretted not planting cotton last year and suffered losses, are all people I know well. Reading this article was like talking with them, it felt very familiar.

　　The newspaper was snatched away by someone else. Lying in bed alone, I recalled Comrade Guo Linzhou's stuttering words: "Don't look down on me for stuttering; I am very efficient at completing the tasks assigned by the higher-ups! If I explain things to the people, they will all be happy.” This was a conversation I had with him when I returned home in 1946. Indeed, he has a high reputation among the masses. Even my eighty-year-old grandmother said, "Little Tao (Linzhou's nickname) does things fairly." This time, Comrade Linzhou led the people of the whole village to plant cotton, proposed good methods of "three checks" and "four comparisons," and was praised by the Party newspaper! But when I compare myself with him, I am too ashamed. I have been in the army for eight years and a Party member for several years, but my thinking is always so fragile. Although I have studied at the Party school for more than a year, I still cannot handle specific problems rationally. For example, when it comes to criticism and self-criticism, I know that this is a good weapon to help progress and promote work. But when the problem comes to me personally, I start nitpicking. I raise my head to argue, thinking that others do not see the problem comprehensively and are deliberately making things difficult for me. Otherwise, why can't they see my advantages and only see my shortcomings (in fact, there are very few advantages)? I even get furious, scaring my peers and subordinates so that they dare not give me any opinions, isolating myself, limiting my progress, and still thinking that I have won. For example, last year, Deputy Political Commissar Yang criticized my serious warlord-like style of beating a comrade at the branch meeting. After the meeting, an administrative order gave me a warning. At that time, I still emphasized that it takes two to tango, and my understanding of my own mistakes was unclear. Recently, I have been studying shooting theory, which is a brain-intensive task. When helping Comrade Liu Heng, I even said he was stupid. At the meeting, when the other party gave me an opinion, I did not deeply examine my attitude towards helping comrades, and I still felt that the other person was narrow-minded. Although my thinking is so backward, in the past, I always felt that I was somewhat stronger than the district and village cadres. But where exactly was I stronger? Today I can't answer. Let's compare Village Chief Guo Linzhou with me: he constantly implements the instructions given to him by the Party and higher-ups in the village, never showing any weariness due to the amount of work. For example, this time, when the higher-ups assigned the task of planting cotton, he tried every means to encourage the farmers' enthusiasm for planting cotton, using past practical examples to convince the farmers from the bottom of their hearts that they were willing to plant more cotton, thus increasing their confidence. Isn't this a concrete manifestation of actively serving the people? And what about me? Apart from making trouble about my position, comparing myself to others in terms of enjoyment, complaining, and beating and scolding revolutionary comrades and being punished, what contributions have I made? I didn't even do a good job of leading a company in the past, so what's so great about me today? Today, reading "Party Life" has been a great inspiration to this backward Party member. I realize that only by uniting the broad masses of the people and solving problems for the broad masses of the people will we gain the support of the broad masses of the people. Conversely, no matter how beautifully one speaks, if one does not do practical work, one will quickly become isolated under the supervision of the masses. From now on, I will be determined to overcome my erroneous thoughts and behaviors, correctly use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, connect with the masses, unite with comrades, improve my work, and transform myself. I will clearly establish the view of serving the people wholeheartedly and the idea of always being a combatant, overcome purely military viewpoints, strengthen the study of current events and political theory, and strive to learn to be a true Communist Party member. Finally, I suggest that comrades in the army read the People's Daily "Party Life" more often. Although some of the materials are not closely related to army life, they are very helpful for the ideological education of Party members. I also hope that "Party Life" will pay attention to selecting and publishing some materials from the army.

### 学做一个真正的共产党员——读《党的生活》后的反省

　　学做一个真正的共产党员
    ——读《党的生活》后的反省
    杨增
    五月九日下午，我从团里开通讯工作会议回来正要休息时，看到桌子上放着当天的人民日报。翻开报纸一看，三版上党的生活栏《郭家庄支部保证出全苗》这个题目，立刻吸引了我的注意。我就是郭家庄的人，这篇文章里说的就是我村里的事。
    村长郭林舟（支委）是抗日时期我的老战友。订计划动员本家和邻居七户多种棉花的民兵杨运起，去年不种棉吃亏后悔的张平禄等，都是我熟悉的人物。看着这篇文章，就像和他们在一起谈话一样，真是感到亲切。
    报纸被别人抢去了，我一个人躺在床上回忆着郭林舟同志的结巴嘴：“别看咱嘴结巴，完成上级布置的工作可落俐着呢！老百姓的大小事，我要是给一解释，保险都欢欢喜喜的。”这是一九四六年我回家时他对我谈的一段话。的确，他在群众中的威信是很高的，连我那八十岁的老奶奶：也说“小涛（林舟的小名）办事可公哩。”这次林舟同志领导全村人民种棉花，提出了“三查”“四比”的好办法，受到了党报的表扬！可是我与他来对比就太惭愧了。我入伍已经八年了，入党也好几年了，思想上老是那样的脆弱，虽经过一年多的党校学习，遇到具体问题总不能理智的处理。如对批评与自我批评来说，也知道这是帮助进步推动工作的好武器。但是问题碰到个人头上就吹毛求疵起来。仰起头来反驳，认为人家看问题不全面，有意识的来与个人为难。否则就是为什么看不出我的优点只看我的缺点呢（实际上优点很少）？甚至大发雷霆，吓得同级和下级都不敢给自己提意见，孤立了自己，限制了自己的进步，还认为是自己胜利了。譬如去年杨副政委在支部大会上批评我打一位同志的严重的军阀主义作风。会后，行政通令给予警告处分，当时我还强调一个巴掌拍不响，而对自己的错误认识不清。最近学习射击学理，本来这是件费脑子的事，在和刘珩同志互助时，竟说人家笨。会议上对方给提出意见，我并没有深刻检讨自己帮助同志的态度如何，还感觉人家肚量太窄。虽然自己思想这样落伍，过去还总觉着比区村干部多少会强些，究竟强在什么地方？今天我是答不出来的。就拿我村村长郭林舟同志与我对比一下吧：他在村中经常不断的执行着党和上级给他的指示，从没有因工作多表示厌倦。像这次上级布置了种棉工作，他就想尽一切办法，鼓舞了农民的种棉情绪，用以往的实际例子，说得农民们从心坎里愿意多种棉花，提高了信心。难道这还不是积极为人民服务的具体表现吗？再拿我来比，除了闹地位、比享受、发牢骚、打骂革命同志受处分外还有什么功劳呢？过去搞一个连队工作都没搞好，今天还有什么了不起呢？今天读了《党的生活》，对我这个落伍党员的启发是相当大的。我认识到了，只有团结广大的群众，给广大的群众解决问题，才会得到广大群众的拥护。相反的，口头上说的如何漂亮，但不做实际工作，在群众中的监督下，很快就会孤立起来的。我将从此下定决心，克服自己的错误思想和行为，正确的运用批评与自我批评的武器，联系群众、团结同志、改进工作、改造自己。明确树立全心全意为人民服务的观点，和永远做一个战斗队员的思想，并克服单纯的军事观点，加强时事学习和政治理论学习，努力学做一个真正的共产党员。最后，我建议部队同志，要多多阅读人民日报《党的生活》。虽然其中有些材料和部队生活关系不很密切，但对党员的思想教育上是很有作用的。并希望《党的生活》注意选登些部队的材料。
