　　To the Rent Q&A Editor:
    Here are several questions regarding housing issues, please answer:
    (1) If a lease agreement has already been signed by both parties, can the landlord terminate it midway?
    (2) Does the government have any regulations on rent amounts? Can the landlord increase rent under the pretext of relying on rent for a living, or can the tenant reduce rent due to financial difficulties? Can paying less rent be justified by renting for many years?
    (3) If the tenant voluntarily repairs the house, can they demand compensation from the landlord or request a reduction in rent?

    Dear Li Jingbo:
    The following are the answers to your questions from the Beijing Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau:
    1.  Both the landlord and the tenant should abide by and fulfill the contract or rental agreement (which should have a shop guarantee). If either party raises an objection, and the other party agrees, the original agreement can certainly be invalidated, and a new agreement established. Whether mid-term changes to the agreement should be permitted depends on whether the content of the lease is reasonable.
    2.  The government does not have specific regulations regarding house rental amounts. Landlords and tenants should negotiate and agree on a fair and reasonable basis, according to the specific circumstances of the house, such as size, condition, and location. The landlord's request to increase rent under the pretext of living off the rent, or the tenant's request to reduce rent due to financial difficulties, should not be valid reasons. The length of the rental period should not affect the payment of reasonable rent.
    3.  If the tenant voluntarily installs electrical wiring, lays concrete floors, and whitewashes, etc., they generally should not demand compensation from the landlord or reduce the rent, unless there is a separate agreement with the landlord.

### 房租答问

　　房租答问编辑同志：
    有关房屋问题数则，请答复：
    （一）已经双方订立之租屋契约，房主是否可以中途提出废除？
    （二）政府对房租租额，有无规定？房东能否借口靠租度日而增租或房客因生活困难而减租？租住年限多是否可少付租？
    （三）房客自愿修建房屋，是否可向房主索取费用或要求减低房租？
     李镜波李镜波君：
    所询问题，由北京市人民政府民政局答复如下：
    一、房主与房客间，所订契约或租折（应有铺保）双方都应遵守、履行。如任何一方提出异议，而经另一方同意，当然可以将原约作废，另立新约。中途改约之应否允许，要视租约内容之是否合理而定。
    二、政府对于房屋租额，并没有具体规定。主客双方应根据房屋之大小好坏座落地址等具体情况，在公平合理原则下自行议定。房东借口以房租度日要求增租或房客以生活困难要求减租，都不应成为理由。租住年限的多少不应影响交纳合理租金。
    三、房客自愿增装电线，做洋灰地，以及刷浆等，除与房东另有契约外，一般不应因此向房东索取费用或因此减低租金。
