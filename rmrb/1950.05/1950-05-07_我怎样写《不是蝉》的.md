　　How I Wrote "Not a Cicada"
　　Wei Lianzhen
　　"Comrade Wei Lianzhen, author of 'Not a Cicada'," I really don't dare accept such a title. Because the creation of this play was not the result of my efforts alone. I was originally a worker who used a hammer to repair vehicles, and I only attended elementary school for four or five years. In the old society, I was a poor worker who suffered the most oppression and was often looked down upon. Only after the liberation of Shijiazhuang, under the leadership of the Communist Party, did my political consciousness gradually grow.

　　Because of class consciousness, I felt the pain of pre-liberation even more. Therefore, I am willing to unite everyone and improve production. During the Red May production competition in 1949, I heard some workers complain because they were not used to the competition. Although I am not the person in charge of education, I was unwilling to stand by and do nothing when I saw some workers lagging behind. So I planned to use artistic methods to unite and persuade the backward workers. When I first wrote this play, it was only about reforming backward elements. Later, I thought that writing a play must mobilize the actors, and it is best to solve several problems at once. I am very busy with work and cannot write plays often. So I also wanted to show the process of the production competition on the stage, and at the same time, the play should also praise the activists. Because our section has performed some small programs, the workers felt that they were not satisfying to watch, so in order to satisfy the workers, I had to write a large-scale one. After I had these ideas, I looked for materials from all aspects. First, I found the reasons for being backward: 1. Unwilling to learn; 2. Lived a better life than ordinary workers before liberation; 3. Too deeply influenced by the bad ideas left over from the old society; 4. Too much contact with loafers. After thinking of these reasons, I felt that I must find an activist to contrast with him. The reasons for being active must be the opposite of being backward. But I also wanted to show production on the stage so that the audience could understand it more clearly. But there are many types of production, and there are also many active workers. Which kind of work and which active worker should I choose to portray? Originally, the general production work, apart from vehicles, is machines, which are not easy to perform on stage. It is easier to perform a blacksmith. At the same time, Master Bai in the blacksmith group is also very active, united, and helpful in all aspects, and also very skilled. I made up my mind that I must write about Master Bai. But who should I write about as a backward element? I was afraid that no one would be happy if I wrote about them. So I wrote about various different backward behaviors together. But I was also afraid that if I wrote about the type of work of a certain group, that work group would not be happy. So I found Master Bai in the blacksmith group and talked to him, explaining that the purpose of performing the play was to improve production, and I planned to write about a backward worker in their group, which would greatly facilitate writing the script. He readily agreed to my request. He said: "It doesn't matter, you write it. We have no objections in our group."

　　One day at noon, everyone took advantage of mealtime to sit under the shade of the trees in the field to discuss work issues. While they were having an interesting discussion, suddenly a cicada (mázhīliáo) on the tree chirped… and made a lot of noise. Everyone unanimously disliked it and shooed it away. It stopped chirping at that time, and everyone immediately continued the discussion. Just as they were about to speak, it chirped again on the tree. Everyone laughed and continued to shoo it away. But every time it stopped chirping, everyone was about to continue speaking, it chirped again. After this happened four or five times in a row, everyone couldn't bear it anymore. Bai Baoshan, a worker from our section, climbed up the treetop and caught it. At that time, I thought to myself: This cicada really suffered from being too talkative. If the cicada could make honey like a bee and also sing, it would definitely be loved. Some people only care about enjoying themselves arbitrarily, regardless of other people's lives, and don't know how to reflect, aren't they just like this cicada? So I also wanted to perform this cicada on the stage. But how could I connect it with writing a production play? So I thought of a way, using a person's nickname to represent it. But why would someone give him this nickname? I also thought of a way, using the same pronunciation to cause it. So in the play, Ma Shunbao is called Mázhīliáo (homophone for cicada). Later, I thought again, I shouldn't say that workers are cicadas. So the play is called "Not a Cicada." After I had these ideas, I went to find some model deeds. For example, renovating ten large broken cars in their spare time, installing one hundred and forty-four low-side cars, finding screws from the scrap iron pile… I wrote these kinds of work in it.

　　Let me first introduce the use of installing low-side cars. That is, under the task of repairing and opening the Jinghan Road in 1949, low-side cars were needed to pull stone ballast for the roadbed. At that time, although there were low-side cars, there were very few. If high-side freight cars were used to pull stone ballast, it would easily affect transportation. Moreover, it would also be too labor-intensive to load and unload the stone ballast. Therefore, our section called on all employees in the section to install low-side cars in their spare time, and set a deadline for completion. Also, because there were no screws at that time, how could low-side cars be installed? Although we could request the Railway Bureau to send screws, the time would be exceeded and we would not be able to complete it on schedule. So everyone thought of a way to solve the temporary difficulty. Everyone unanimously requested to let the large pile of scrap iron (waste iron) turn over, and as a result, many screws were found, and many finished products were also found in it. I thought this matter should be introduced to make other factories and sections also pay attention to the fact that there are finished products in the scrap iron pile.

　　In addition, the scene of Master Bai complaining about his suffering was originally the real experience of Master Cao in our section. But in order to make the effect of this play more concentrated, it was written on Master Bai. Before I started writing, I first thought about the number of actors in our section, the personality of each actor, and the acting ability of each actor. I must take care of the actors, because our amateur theater troupe is different from professional theater troupes. We only have four female actors, you can't write too many or too few. If you write a play with two female actors, then the female actors who cannot participate may have opinions. "If you let her act, then you won't let me act?" Of course, this kind of care is very inconvenient for writing a play. But in order to initially consolidate this theater troupe, I have to take care of it. Also, the female actors in the play have very few lines, because the female actors have too little education, and they also have to participate in learning in their spare time. I was afraid of affecting their learning. So there are very few lines, making it easier for them to remember.

　　The story of this play is very unconcentrated, and there is also a reason. In order to take care of setting up the scenery, it was written as a scene in front of the second curtain and a scene behind it. In this way, the front and back scenes can be pushed and changed, so that there is time to set up the scenery. Anyway, the scene in front of the second curtain does not need scenery. But in this way, the plot is not concentrated.

　　Originally, I didn't expect this play to be performed in other places, it was just for performances at our section's evening parties. But it's not that I didn't want others to see it. I was afraid that people wouldn't like to watch it. Later, after this play was performed in our section, I didn't expect it to be valued by others. Ah! I really felt very strange. I had never written a play before, it was like a duck, how could it learn to sing like a bird! It must sing badly, right? To be honest, this play has been revised three or four times. During the rehearsal, all the employees in our section unanimously assisted, and the actors all gave full play to their creative genius. Everyone collectively put forward opinions and revised it at any time. In addition, with the help and guidance of Comrade Hong Tao and Comrade Ren Guilin from the Shijiazhuang Municipal Cultural Committee, we have today's performance achievements. I hope everyone will not take me as the only author. The performance of "Not a Cicada" is the power of everyone. I am like a child learning to dig vegetables, I don't understand the nutritional value of vegetables, and I don't know which kind of vegetables is suitable for the taste of the comrades, I just dig them up with mud and water. I hope that the comrades who like to eat my vegetables will select and harmonize them, and I also hope to tell me the method of digging vegetables next time and the types of vegetables that should be paid attention to, so that we can get nutrition when we eat them. I want to pay tribute to the veteran predecessors, express my respect to the comrades who helped us, and hope that everyone will always help us, so that our worker's literary and artistic front will continue to develop and improve.

　　我怎样写《不是蝉》的
    魏连珍
    “《不是蝉》作者魏连珍同志”，这样的称呼我实在不敢接受。因为创作这个剧并不是我一个人的力量。我原来是一个拿锤子的检修车辆的工人，只不过在初级小学念过四、五年书。在旧社会里，我是一个最受压迫的穷工人，时常被人瞧不起。自从石家庄解放后，在共产党的领导下，我的政治觉悟才逐渐的长进了。
    因为阶级的觉悟，更感到解放前的痛苦。所以我愿意团结大家，提高生产。在一九四九年红五月生产竞赛时，我听见少数工友因为对竞赛不大习惯。容易发一些牢骚。虽然我不是负责教育工作的人，但我不愿意眼看部分工友有落后情形，而采取置之不理的态度。所以我打算用文艺方式来团结和说服落后工友。在我初写这个剧的时候。就只是以改造落后分子为主题，后来我又一想，写一次剧必须发动一次演员，最好写一次能解决几个问题。我工作很忙，不能时常写剧。所以我又想把生产竞赛的过程也演在舞台上，同时，剧中也要表扬积极分子。因为我们段演过些小型节目，工友们都觉得看着不过瘾，为了使工友们满意，只得写大型的。我有了这一些想头以后，就从各方面想材料。首先我找到了落后的原因：一、不肯学习；二、在解放前比较一般工友生活好；三、受旧社会遗留的坏思想太深；四、接近二流子太多。我想到了这几种原因后，觉得一定要找一个积极分子和他作对比。积极的原因一定是和落后的相反的。但是我又想把生产搬演在舞台上，好使观众看的明白些。但是生产种类很多。积极工友也很多。究竟演哪一种工作和哪一位积极分子呢？本来，生产工作一般的除去车辆就是机器。都不容易表演在舞台上。只好演一个铁匠还比较容易些。同时铁匠组里的白师傅也非常积极，团结互助各方面都很好，技术方面也很高。我拿定了主意，一定要写白师傅。但是落后分子写谁呢？恐怕写谁谁也不乐意。所以我把各种不同落后的表现，写在一起。但是又怕写那一组的工作种类，那一工作组也不乐意。所以我找到铁匠组里白师傅和他谈了谈，说明演戏是为了提高生产，打算把一个落后工友写在他们这组里，对写剧本就有很大的便利。他很爽快的答应了我的要求。他说：“没关系，你写吧。我们组里没有意见。”
    这天中午大家利用吃饭时间，坐在场内的树荫下面讨论工作问题。正在讨论的有趣的时候，忽然树上有一个麻蜘蟟（蝉）唧唧……的乱叫。大家一致的讨厌它，“去……去”的轰它。它当时住了声，大家随即讨论。刚要发言，它在树上又叫起来了。大家都笑了，仍旧“去……去”的轰它。可是当它每次住了声，大家又要接续发言的时候，它又叫起来了。这样一连四五次后，大家实在忍不住了。我段工友白宝善爬上树梢，把它给捉住。当时我心里这样想：这个蝉实在是吃了爱叫的亏。如果蝉像蜜蜂一样的能制蜜，又会唱，一定会受人的爱护。有些人只顾自己任意享受，不管别人的生活，不知道反省，还不是和这只蝉一样吗？所以我又想把这只蝉表演在舞台上。但是要写生产剧，怎么能和蝉连在一起呢？所以我想了一个法子，用一个人的外号来表示。但是为什么要有人给他起这个外号呢？又想了一个办法，用字音相同来引起。所以剧中马顺保叫成麻蜘蟟。后来我又一想，我不应该说工人是蝉。所以剧名叫作《不是蝉》。我有了这些想法以后，就再去找了些模范事迹。譬如在业余时间装修十辆大破车呀，按装一百四十四辆低边车呀，从废铁堆里找螺丝呀……我就把这类工作写在里面。
    我先介绍按装低边车的用途吧。就是在一九四九年修通京汉路的任务下，要用低边车拉石头碴子作路基。那时虽有低边车，但少的很。如果用高边货车拉石头碴，很容易影响运输。再说装卸石头碴的时候，也太费工。所以我们段号召全段员工在业余时间按装低边车，并且限期完成。又因当时没有螺丝，如何按装低边车？虽然可以请求路局发螺丝，但是时间要超过，不能按期完成。所以大家想了个解决临时困难的办法。大家一齐要求让大碎铁堆（废铁）翻身，结果翻出许多螺丝，并且从中还找出很多的成品来。我想这件事应当介绍出去，使别的厂段也来注意废铁堆里有成品。
    另外关于白师傅诉苦的场面，本来是我段曹师傅的实事经过。但是为了使这个剧效果更集中些，写在白师傅的身上了。在我未开笔以前，我先想了想我段演员的多少，每个演员的性格，和每个演员的演技能力。我必须照顾到演员方面，因为我们业余剧团和专业剧团不相同。我们的女演员只有四个，你写多了或少了都不行。如果写了两个女演员的戏，那么不能参加的女演员，恐怕就有意见。“让她演就不让我演吗？”当然，这样照顾对写剧是很不方便的。但是我为了使这个剧团初步的巩固起来，不得不照顾。还有，剧中女演员的词句很少，这是因为女演员文化太低，她们在业余时间还要参加学习，我怕影响她们学习。所以词句都很少，使她们容易记住。
    这个剧的故事非常不集中，也有个原因。为了照顾摆布景，写成了二道幕前边一场，后边一场。这样前一场后一场的推换，可以有时间摆布景。反正演二道前边的场面，不用布景。可是这样一来剧情就不集中了。
    本来这个戏想不到会演到别的地方去，只是为了在我们段里遇有晚会时，作为联欢演出的。但是也不是不愿意让别人看。恐怕人家不爱看。后来这个戏在我们段里演出后，想不到会被旁人重视了。啊呀！我真觉着奇怪的很。我本来没写过剧，就像是个鸭子一样，那会学鸟唱呢！一定唱的不好听吧？说实在的，这个剧原来经过三四次的修改，在排演当中我段全体员工一致的协助，演员们都发挥了每个人的创造天才。集体提出意见随时修改。再加石市文委会洪涛同志和任桂林同志帮助修改和指教，才有了今天演出的成绩。我希望大家不要拿我一个人当作者。《不是蝉》的演出是大家的力量。我好像是个小孩子学挖菜一样，不懂得菜类的营养，也不懂得那类菜适合同志的口味，只不过是连泥带水的挖来吧了。希望爱吃我的菜的同志，加以挑选和调和，更希望告诉我下次挖菜的方法和应注意的几种菜，这样我们吃了下来才能得到营养。我要向老前辈们致敬礼，向帮助我们的同志表示敬意，并希望大家永远的帮助我们，使我们工人文艺战线不断的发展与提高。
