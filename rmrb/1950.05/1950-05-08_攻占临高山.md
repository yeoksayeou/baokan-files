　　The Capture of Lingao Mountain
　　By accompanying reporter Lu Yiding
　　The Fifth Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army's amphibious vanguard force, which landed in Lingao County, was ordered to capture Lingao Mountain, the key to northern Hainan, in order to meet the main force's landing.
　　Lingao Mountain stands behind the coast of Lingao County, and is the commanding height on the coastline of more than two hundred li west of Haikou City. The bandit 64th Army, 131st Division, chose this key to the northern gate of Hainan Island, built layers of fortifications on the mountain peaks, and equipped it with a field artillery company, attempting to rely on this high ground, which was difficult to attack and easy to defend, to block our army's landing.
　　At dawn on April 17th, the People's Liberation Army arrived at the foot of Lingao Mountain after a thirty-li forced march. The soldiers began to advance towards the top of the mountain along the rugged and thorny mountain road. After climbing the mountain for about five or six li, it was already bright. The enemy's scattered bunkers, roadblocks and other fortifications were right in front of them.
　　When the Liberation Army advanced to only a hundred meters away from the enemy's position, the enemy's sentry shouted, "Who's there?" Then, both sides began to shoot. Chen Tingxian, the Fifth Company's political instructor, led the First Platoon to rush to the front of the roadblock, only twenty steps away from the bunker, with extremely fast movements. The enemy's firepower was extremely fierce. The calm and clever political instructor immediately led the soldiers to quietly move to the right, using the roadblock as cover, leaving only two shooters to fire cold shots from time to time to attract the enemy's firepower.
　　The two machine guns of the Second Platoon, which were responsible for covering the attack, could not unleash their firepower because the assault troops were too close to the bunkers. At this moment, the brave machine gunner Qiao Yongli suddenly rushed to the edge of the roadblock like a gust of wind, and raised his machine gun and swept towards the bunker opening with a burst of gunfire. The enemy's machine gun fell silent, and half of the enemy's broken gun barrel was placed on the gun eye. The soldiers cheered together.
　　The enemy scrambled into the communication trenches, and still wanted to make a last-ditch struggle with the remaining two bunkers. The soldiers fixed their bayonets, prepared grenades, and advanced from the left and right. The fleeing enemy did not have time to get into the bunkers, and all raised their hands and became prisoners. On the enemy's field artillery position behind the bunkers, those cannons pointing at the coast all became the spoils of the Liberation Army without firing a single shot.
　　After capturing Lingao Mountain, the northern gate of Hainan Island was opened, the enemy lost its support behind, and the main force successfully landed. In the morning sun, the soldiers stood on the top of the mountain, looking at the neat and majestic thousands of ships along the coast, all happily cheering. The muzzles of the captured field guns were also turned around to launch earth-shattering bombardments at the enemy.

　　攻占临高山
    随军记者路以丁
    在临高县登陆的人民解放军渡海大军先锋部队某部第五连，奉命攻占琼北锁钥的临高山，以接应主力部队登陆。
    临高山矗立在临高县的海岸后背，是海口市以西二百余里海岸线上的制高点。匪六十四军一三一师选中了这个琼岛北门的锁钥，在山峰上构筑起层层工事，并配备了一个野炮连，企图依凭这一难攻易守的高地来阻击我渡海大军登陆。
    四月十七日拂晓，解放军经过三十里的强行军到达了临高山脚。战士们开始沿着崎岖和荆棘的山路向山头前进，爬行上山约五六里后天已大亮。敌人的星罗棋布的地堡、鹿砦等工事就在眼前。
    当解放军进至距敌阵仅百余米时，敌人的岗哨才叫着：“那一个？”接着，双方就砰砰地射击起来。五连指导员陈廷显率领第一排以极快的动作直冲到离地堡仅二十余步远的鹿砦跟前。敌人的火力极为猛烈。沉着机灵的指导员随即带领战士们借着鹿砦作隐蔽向右边悄悄转移。只留下两个射手不时打着冷枪以吸引敌人的火力。
    担任掩护的二排两挺机枪，因突击部队靠地堡太近无法施展火力。这时，勇敢的机枪手乔永利突然像一阵风似的猛冲到鹿砦边，端起机枪对准地堡口子哗哗一阵扫射，敌人的机枪哑然无声了，枪眼上摆着打坏了的敌人的半截枪管，战士们一齐欢呼起来。
    敌人忙乱地往交通沟里钻，还想凭借其余两个碉堡作垂死挣扎。战士们上起刺刀，准备好手榴弹从左右两路突进。溃逃的敌人没有来得及钻进碉堡，都一齐举起手当了俘虏。地堡后面的敌人野炮阵地上，那些炮口指着海岸的大炮也一发未放就全部变成了解放军的胜利品。
    攻占了临高山后，海南岛的北门洞开，敌人失去了后背的依托，大军也胜利登陆了。在朝阳中，战士们站在山头上，远望海岸沿线整齐雄壮的千百条船只，都高兴地欢呼起来。缴得来的野炮的炮口，也掉转过来向敌人发出了天崩地裂的轰击。
