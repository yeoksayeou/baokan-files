Regarding the Statement Concerning the Commercial Press Edition of "Fuxing High School National Geography"

    After reading the article "Several Political Ideological Problems in Middle School Geography Textbooks" written by Jin Canran in this publication, the Editorial Department of the Commercial Press and Wang Chengzhu, the editor of "Fuxing High School National Geography," wrote letters successively to make a statement. The Editorial Department of the Commercial Press acknowledged that "this book was hastily reprinted in December 1949 to meet the spring sales demand. At that time, due to a lack of scrutiny, it was not thoroughly revised, and there were indeed errors. The original author, Wang Chengzhu, has now been asked to actively revise it." It also stated that the book "indicates on the copyright page of the first volume that it is the 120th edition of the revised version, referring to the revised version of 1947," and the version reprinted in December 1949 had not been revised.

    Wang Chengzhu believes that Jin Canran's article "is indeed necessary to help teachers critically use old textbooks." He also stated that "Fuxing High School National Geography" was a work from more than ten years before liberation, and he himself had not revised it after liberation. "The reason why this textbook still contains many erroneous political ideas is because it legally continues to use the old version. The Commercial Press only recently sent a letter entrusting the revision."

　　关于商务版《复兴高中本国地理》的声明
    商务印书馆出版部及“复兴高中本国地理”编者王成组读了本刊金灿然写的《中学地理教本中的几个政治思想问题》一文后，先后写信来声明。商务印书馆出版部承认“此书一九四九年十二月因赶印春销，匆促添印，当时失于检点，未能彻底重行改编，确有错误。现已请原著作人王成组积极改编。”并声明该书“上册版权页上注明改编本第一二○版，系指三十六年之改编本”，一九四九年十二月所添印的版本并未经过改编。
    王成组认为金灿然的文章，“帮助教师们批判地使用旧教本，的确是有必要。”并声明“复兴高中本国地理”是解放前十多年的作品，解放以后他自己并没有修改过，“这一部教本所以还存着诸多错误的政治思想，是由于依法沿用旧版。商务出版部最近才来信委托修改。”
