Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 21st: Park Il-u, Minister of Internal Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, issued a statement on the 18th regarding the criminal actions of the South Korean Syngman Rhee puppet government in plotting to instigate civil war, stating: The Syngman Rhee gang is currently fabricating an adventurous scheme for a surprise attack. During April and May, Syngman Rhee has concentrated five of his eight infantry divisions along the 38th parallel. In Gyeonggi Province, the puppet army's 1st Division is deployed in the direction of Kaesong, and the 7th Division in the direction of Dongducheon. In addition, two regiments are deployed in the direction of Ongjin. In Gangwon Province, the 6th Division is deployed in the direction of Chuncheon, and the 8th Division in the direction of Yangyang. At the same time, Syngman Rhee, Shin Sung-mo, and other traitorous elements have clamored that "May and June will be months of crisis," fabricating rumors that the Korean People's Army is preparing to attack South Korea, attempting to create a tense atmosphere in order to obtain more weapons from the United States to realize their plot to instigate civil war and sell Korea to U.S. imperialism; and attempting to deceive the South Korean people with a tense atmosphere before the puppet elections at the end of May.

Park Il-u emphasized: The Syngman Rhee gang's plot to provoke civil war is being carried out under the cover of the U.S. imperialist tool - the "United Nations Commission on Korea". This trick absolutely cannot deceive the Korean people. The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is closely watching the South Korean traitorous gang's scheme for a surprise attack. Park Il-u finally called on all Korean people to be vigilant and ready at all times to stop the Syngman Rhee gang's criminal acts of adventurous surprise attacks.

　　南朝鲜傀儡阴谋布置偷袭
    朴一禹号召提高警惕     
    随时准备制止李承晚匪帮挑衅
    【新华社平壤二十一日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府内务部长朴一禹，十八日就南朝鲜李承晚傀儡政府阴谋挑动内战的罪恶行为发表谈话称：李承晚匪帮现正制造着一个冒险的偷袭阴谋。在四、五月间，李承晚已将其八个步兵师团中的五个师团集中到三八线沿线。在京畿道，布署在开城方面的是伪军第一师团，在东豆川方面的是第七师团。另外有两个联队布署在瓮津方面。在江原道，布置在春川方面的是第六师团，在襄阳方面的是第八师团。与此同时，李承晚、申性模等卖国分子，曾叫嚣“五月和六月将是危机的月份”，捏造共和国人民军准备进攻南朝鲜的谰言，企图造成紧张气氛，以便从美国得到更多的武器，来实现其挑动内战，将朝鲜出卖给美帝国主义的阴谋；并企图在五月底的伪选之前，以紧张气氛欺骗南朝鲜人民。
    朴一禹着重指出：李承晚匪帮挑拨内战的阴谋，是在美帝国主义的侵略工具——“联合国朝鲜委员会”的掩护下进行的。这种诡计绝对欺瞒不了朝鲜人民。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府正密切注视着南朝鲜卖国匪帮的偷袭阴谋。朴一禹最后号召全朝鲜人民要提高警惕，随时准备制止李承晚匪帮冒险偷袭的罪行。
