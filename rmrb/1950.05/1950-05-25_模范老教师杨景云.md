　　Model Old Teacher Yang Jingyun

　　At the literacy campaign award meeting in Songjiang Province, the most striking figure was an old teacher, Yang Jingyun, aged sixty-one, wearing reading glasses and constantly taking notes. He is a mass teacher at the winter school in Xinzheng Village, Lianzhushan District, Mishan County. He studied in a private school for ten years in his youth and graduated from the Panshi County Teacher Training Institute in 1906. After that, he worked in education for more than thirty years. After the "August 15th" (end of WWII), he also served as a primary school principal for two years, resigning due to old age. His family comes from a tenant farmer background and lives in poverty.

　　After the winter school in Xinzheng Village was organized in the winter of 1949, it was difficult to find a suitable teacher. Some people thought of asking Yang Jingyun, but they were afraid that he was too old and unwilling to do it. However, Yang Jingyun did not refuse at all and gladly accepted the request of the masses. He said: "I never thought that I could still serve our new China and help farmers to culturally stand up. I must do my best to run the winter school well!"

　　From then on, regardless of wind or snow, Teacher Yang Jingyun was always the first to arrive at the classroom every night, sweeping the floor clean, arranging the tables, starting the fire, and boiling water, waiting for the students to come to class. In the beginning, the classroom order was not good. He understood that this was because the cadres did not participate in the study, and there was no leader in the winter school. He went to the cadres and said to them: "The winter school is going to collapse!" The cadres asked in surprise: "Why?" He said: "To run the winter school well, the cadres must take the lead in participating in the study and play a backbone role. If you don't go to school, how can the winter school not collapse?" His sincere and frank criticism moved the cadres to attend school, and the order of the winter school gradually stabilized.

　　Xinzheng Village is located at the foot of the mountain, and wolves often come out to forage at night. Several female students who lived far from the school were afraid of wolves and asked to drop out. The old teacher comforted them kindly: "Don't be afraid, I will send you home every day!" These words moved the village cadres. The village chief said: "We can't let the old gentleman send them, the village should send a model militia team to send them every day." As a result, no one dropped out.

　　Wu Fengzhen and other seven students were afraid of exams and claimed to be sick and asked to drop out. After understanding this situation, the old teacher and the winter school committee jointly convened a cultural grievance meeting to inspire everyone to recognize the importance of learning. At the meeting, he said to the students who wanted to drop out: "The sum of your three ages is not as great as mine. What am I here for every day? Isn't it for you young people?" Then some students said: "Teacher Yang teaches us so hard every day, and he also burns fire and sweeps the floor, coughing all the time. What is this for? How can we not study hard?" At the meeting, the students recalled their own hardships of being illiterate. After this meeting, the students who wanted to drop out lowered their heads shamefully and said: "We won't drop out, we have to study hard!"

　　Teacher Yang's little girl had a very severe lung disease. However, Teacher Yang's teaching enthusiasm was not affected by his child's serious illness or the family's difficult life. On the day his child died, the child gasped and held his hand, saying: "Good Dad, I won't live much longer! Stay at home and see me for a while!" Although he was very sad at the time, when the time for winter school arrived, he broke away from his child's hand and went to school, patiently teaching the students. When he returned home from school that day, his lovely daughter had already passed away. This incident is deeply and forever remembered in the memories of the students. Everyone was determined to repay Teacher Yang by studying hard.

　　He is in charge of compound teaching in three classes. His teaching methods are closely related to the actual situation of the students. One day, many students asked for leave, so he talked about the two words "bitterness and happiness." When talking about the word "happiness," he said: "At my age, being able to teach everyone literacy and learn culture in the winter school, I am really extremely happy." When talking about the word "bitterness," he said: "In the past, you were all illiterate, only doing hard labor for the landlords, and you couldn't even get enough to eat and wear. There's no need to mention that bitterness. After the Communist Party came, the people got the opportunity to learn culture. We must study hard to be worthy of Chairman Mao!" In this way, the students not only learned to recognize and speak these words, and knew how to use them, but also improved their political awareness. He also taught students to learn abacus. Previously, there were only two people in the village who knew how to use the abacus, including him. Now there are more than a dozen people who know how to use the abacus. It is not difficult to keep accounts and evaluate work during production.

　　Although he is old, he still studies actively and subscribes to the Songjiang Daily and Living Knowledge. During the day, in addition to collecting manure, he prepares lessons and reads newspapers. He tells the students about the major national events in the newspaper. He is also able to humbly learn from others. He once found other primary school teachers and said: "You teach me! Originally you were my students, but now you have all walked ahead of me."

　　At the Songjiang Provincial Award Meeting, Yang Jingyun said in a loud voice: "I am determined to eliminate illiteracy in our entire village within three years. I will not rest in peace if I do not eliminate illiteracy!" These words full of confidence made all the models determined to recognize one thousand words in 1950.

　　模范老教师杨景云
    松江省识字运动奖模会上，最使人注目的，是一位六十一岁、带着老花眼镜、时刻不停地作着记录的老教师——杨景云。他是密山县连珠山区新正村冬学的群众教师。年青时曾在私塾念过十年书，一九○六年在磐石县师资养成所毕业后，做了三十多年的教育工作，“八一五”后还当了二年小学校长，因为年老辞了职。他的家庭是雇农成份，生活很贫苦。
    新正村的冬学在一九四九年冬组织起来后，找不到适当的老师。有人想找杨景云，但怕他岁数太大，不肯干。可是杨景云毫不推辞，很愉快地接受了群众的要求。他说：“没想到我还能给咱们新中国服务，帮助农民在文化上翻身。我一定要尽我的力量把冬学办好！”
    从这时起，不管刮风下雪，杨景云老师每天晚上就第一个走到教室里，把地扫净，排好桌子，生好火，烧上水，等候学员们来上课。最初上课时，课堂秩序不好。他了解了这是由于干部没参加学习，冬学里没有领导人。他就去找干部，对他们说：“冬学要垮台啦！”干部很惊奇地问：“为什么？”他说：“要把冬学办好，必须干部带头参加学习，起骨干作用。你们都不上学，冬学那能不垮台呢？”他这种诚恳坦白的批评，使干部都感动得上了学，冬学秩序也渐渐安定了。
    新正这村子靠着山脚，在黑夜里，狼时常出来寻食。离学校远的几个妇女学员怕狼，要求退学。老教师亲切的安慰她们：“不要怕，我每天送你们回家！”这话感动了村干部。村长说：“老爷子可送不得，由村上每天派模范自卫队送她们好了。”结果一个退学的也没有。
    吴凤珍等七名学员怕考试，推说有病要求退学。老教师了解了这个情况后，和冬学委员会一同召集学员开文化诉苦会，启发大家认识学习的重要。会上他对要求退学的学员们讲：“你们三个人的岁数加起来也没我的岁数大。我每天来这里为的啥呢？还不是为的你们青年人？”于是有的学员说：“杨老师天天辛辛苦苦地教咱们，每天还烧火、扫地，呛得直咳嗽。这为的啥呢？咱们怎能不好好学呢？”会上学员们都回忆了自己不识字的苦处。经过这次会议以后，要退学的学员都低着头惭愧地说：“咱不退学了，还得好好学呢！”
    杨老师的小姑娘肺病闹的很厉害。但杨老师也没因为孩子病重、家里生活困难而影响教学情绪。在他孩子临死的那天，孩子喘着气，拉着他的手说：“好爸爸，我再活不多久啦！你在家多看我一会儿吧！”当时他心里虽然很难过，但上冬学的时间一到，他便挣脱了孩子的手到学校里去，耐心地给学员上课。那天放学回家，他那可爱的女儿已经去世了。这件事情深深地、永远地记在学员们的记忆里。大家都下了决心，拿努力学习来报答杨老师。
    他一共担任三班的复式教学。他的教学方法密切联系学员的实际情况。有一天，学员请假的很多，他就讲“苦与乐”两个字。讲“乐”字时，他说：“我这么大年纪，能在冬学里教大家识字、学文化，我真是乐的了不得。”讲“苦”字时，他说：“过去你们都不识字，光给地主扛大活，还吃穿不上，那苦处可就不用提啦。共产党来了以后，老百姓得到了学文化的机会。我们得好好学习，才对得起毛主席！”这样学员们不但会认、会讲这些字，知道字的用法，同时也提高了政治觉悟。他还教学员学珠算，早先村里连他只有二个会打算盘的，现在已有十多个人会打算盘。生产时记账、评工都不困难了。
    他岁数虽大，但还积极学习，自己订了松江日报、生活知识。白天除了检粪，就预备课程和看报纸。把报上的国家大事讲给学员听。他又能虚心地向人学习。他曾找别的小学教员说：“你们教我吧！原先你们是我的学生，现在你们都走到我前面了。”
    在松江省奖模大会上，杨景云用宏亮的声音说：“我下决心在三年内把我们全村的文盲消灭掉。不消灭文盲我死不瞑目！”这句充满了信心的话，使全体模范们都下定决心，要在一九五○年内认识上一千字。
