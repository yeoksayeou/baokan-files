(Editor's Note: This article was originally published in the Northeast Daily on May 5th. The experience of implementing the responsibility system in enterprises in the Lüda area, as introduced in this article, is valuable for reference for enterprises across the country. We are reprinting it here with some modifications to the text, so it may differ slightly from the original.)

Two Situations, Two Problems

The implementation of the production responsibility system in Lüda enterprises basically exists in two situations. One is Sino-Soviet joint ventures, which strictly implement a specialized responsibility system in all aspects of production. The system is stipulated by the factory, relying on inspection and rewards and punishments to supervise its implementation, and has not become a conscious action of all workers. However, due to strict enforcement, it has still had a significant impact on production. The other is public enterprises (i.e., factories under the Lüda Administrative Office's Industry Department and Jianxin Company), where the phenomenon of no one being responsible for production is quite serious. Although there are systems in place, they are often not fully implemented.

From the above two situations, it can be seen that there are two problems in implementing and carrying out the responsibility system in Lüda, which should be addressed from two key points. In Sino-Soviet enterprises, education on the responsibility system for cadres and workers should be strengthened to transform the production responsibility system into a conscious action of workers. In public enterprises, past phenomena of no one being responsible for production should be exposed from the bottom up, leadership should be transformed, and a strict production responsibility system should be established. Guanghe Machinery Factory held a staff and worker representative meeting to establish a responsibility system. Of the 632 proposals, more than 60 percent were related to the responsibility system. In the discussion, workers showed that they were willing to take responsibility seriously and demanded that the factory also be responsible. It can be seen that democratic inspection is very useful for establishing a responsibility system.

Several Responsibility Systems

I. Production Responsibility System

	Production Specialization. This refers to the direct producer's responsibility being specialized. This first requires that the division of labor in production should be scientific and clear. Each worker is assigned a specific responsibility in terms of nature, scope, and working hours. For example, the glass factory has a clerk to record the time the glass is produced. Each person watches seven machines, which takes seven hours, with one hour remaining for statistics. To do a good job in production specialization, it is not only necessary to have a reasonable division of labor, but also to assign work to appropriate workers according to the nature of the work so that they can be competent. In Sino-Soviet joint ventures, workers of grades six and seven do important work, and workers of grades five and six are assistants. In public factories, section chiefs and group leaders sometimes assign work based on personal relationships, assigning precision work to workers with low skills, resulting in defective products. Mechanical production involves everyone's division of labor and cooperation. For specialization and coordination, there must be a scientific division of labor. In creating new records, factories that have achieved results have mostly improved their labor organization and established assembly line operations. For example, the Railway Factory's foundry shop divided the sand casting process into three shifts, which made production more orderly and improved efficiency compared to the past.

	Specialized Responsibility for Use and Repair of Machinery and Tools. Many factories have signs stating the specialized responsibility for the use of machinery, but this is often just a formality. The user works in the east, but his name is still hanging on the bed in the west; some factories stipulate the specialized responsibility for the use of machinery, but there is no actual inspection, the machinery continues to break down, and no one is held accountable. In some factories with poor equipment, public machinery (such as wiping beds, etc.) is used by everyone, and everyone is irresponsible, so it breaks down the fastest and it is difficult to investigate responsibility. In Sino-Soviet joint ventures, annual maintenance plans are formulated according to the specific conditions of the machinery, and inspection and repair times are specified. This protects the machinery and determines the interval between machinery repairs without hindering production. In order to implement this plan, in addition to the factory's machinery department and workshop mechanics being responsible, a "three-package system" of specialized management, specialized use, and specialized repair should also be implemented. In addition to regular inspections, repair workers should actively inspect the machinery they are responsible for repairing, and often repair it to avoid major problems. If workers find that the machinery is not working well, they should ask the repair worker responsible for the repair to inspect it. This reduces mechanical failures. Tools should be managed uniformly. Each worker has three to five tool cards and receives and uses tools according to the cards. This makes it possible to identify the user and adjust the use.

	Technical Guidance Specialization. In Sino-Soviet joint ventures, the technical guidance on production is mainly the responsibility of the engineer (or chief technician). For example, at the glass factory, the engineer goes to the factory every morning and immediately goes to each workshop to check the production daily report. If there are technical problems, he immediately issues orders to solve them. After reviewing the report, he reports the main problems that occurred to the factory director. If there are technical problems that the engineer has handled but the factory director does not agree with, he can ask the chief engineer of the general factory to decide. The engineer does not ask about administrative management work, but should provide technical guidance to the planning department, wage department, supply department, and laboratory that are related to technical work. In the afternoon, the engineer guides the relevant work of the above departments and inspects the production situation of the main workshops (such as the melting department).

	Product Specialization. Products of Sino-Soviet joint ventures undergo strict inspection under the requirements of certain specifications. For example, each barrel of paint factory products is marked with the time, shift, and worker number. Once a problem occurs, the responsibility can be clearly investigated. Daily products are inspected by the laboratory, and those that are qualified are signed by the inspector before they can be put into storage. Most public factories do not have laboratories and often mass produce without scientific inspection, resulting in waste. For example, the lathe manufactured by Guanghe Machinery Factory claims to have reached the "world's second-level standard," but after using it, many problems were found.

	Raw Material Supply and Storage Specialization. Industrial raw materials are complex. Without scientific management, they will affect production. For example, in Guanghe Machinery Factory, raw materials are piled up in heaps, not classified, and not divided by size. If you want soft steel, they give you hard steel, and even give you iron if you want steel, which is a great waste. Moreover, because the estimation of work is not accurate or the supply of raw materials is not timely, work is often stopped waiting for materials. When purchasing raw materials, they are not tested, and many raw materials are scrapped because they are not qualified. In Sino-Soviet joint ventures, raw materials are first inspected by the laboratory, and the engineer signs before they are put into storage.

II. Safety Responsibility System

The factories under the Far East Electric Power Company strictly implement the safety responsibility system. The glass factory completed the annual production task in half a year last year and saved 330 million yuan of Guandong currency, but was downgraded to a third-level enterprise in the year-end rating. The only reason was that a cook scalded his legs when he accidentally fell into a pot of boiling water while steaming pancakes. The factory was punished for this. When workers at the cement factory were blasting a mountain, a stone chip hit the mountain and bounced back, slightly injuring a worker. Everyone thought this was a minor accident and did not matter. However, the factory director attached great importance to the matter, ordered the safety circle to be expanded, and issued a warning signal before the explosion. There have been no accidents in the past half year.

Some public factories do not pay attention to safety work, and unfortunately accidents have occurred repeatedly. Last year, a chemical laboratory of Jianxin Company exploded, killing six workers and injuring seven workers in the neighboring workshop. The cause of the accident is still unclear. Last year, a gas cylinder exploded in Guanghua Bulb Factory, causing a fire that killed three people, injured thirteen people, and caused one person to suffer a nervous breakdown. The factory has not yet investigated those responsible. These are all undesirable phenomena.

III. Administrative Responsibility System

The quality of the factory's administrative work has a great relationship with production. For example, when the production department of Guanghe Machinery Factory asks workers for work, the planning department has not yet issued the plan, which confuses the workers. The accounting department of Dalian Textile Factory does not prepare for work on weekdays. Once the Industry Department wants the annual budget, it doubles the budget for one quarter, so it is inaccurate. In Sino-Soviet joint ventures, the administrative responsibility system is extremely strict. For example, the cashier is responsible for ensuring that the cash on hand does not exceed 20,000 yuan. Only one person in charge of the treasury has the right to open it. The head of the finance department can check his accounts at any time, and if there is any discrepancy, he must be held responsible. The situation of other administrative special responsibilities is also the same.

IV. Inspection, Handover, Reporting, and Reward and Punishment Systems

	Inspection System. Some public factories have specialized responsibilities but no inspection. Specialized responsibilities become a formality, which greatly affects production. Dalian Textile Factory recently proposed "reverse inspection," that is, mutual supervision. Workshop A inspects Workshop B. If the semi-finished products do not meet the specifications, they can be rejected. In Sino-Soviet joint ventures, there is a stricter inspection system. For example, in the paint factory, the inspector inspects every two hours during production to prevent substandard products. The glass factory even has "sand watchers" and "timekeepers" who can clearly check the production situation every second.

	Handover System. Accidents often occur when the two shifts alternate and are not responsible for each other. The handover system can ensure the transfer of responsibility and is very important. After Dalian Textile Factory implemented the three-shift system, cotton production increased greatly, but no one was responsible, which was the result of not establishing a handover system. Conversely, in Sino-Soviet joint ventures, the handover system is very strict. For example, a worker at the glass factory who was watching the kiln door saw that the sand had "scattered," but because he was going to hand over in a little more than ten minutes, he did not go to scoop it up and wanted to push it to the next shift. The worker who took over the shift came ten minutes before work and checked it first. When he found that the sand had "scattered" through two kiln doors, he refused to take over. The previous shift worker had to scoop it out, delaying the next shift by forty minutes, and was also criticized.

	Reporting System. Another way to check responsibility is for the responsible person to make a report. The paint factory has daily production and quality reports, and each department and workshop has a log. After the factory director goes to work every day, he spends two or thirty minutes looking at these daily and log reports to understand the general production situation yesterday. Dalian Port holds a report meeting every day. In the morning, the port director goes to work and inspects all departments of the port for a week. After he finishes the inspection, the main persons in charge of each department gather in the port director's office and report to him in ten to twenty minutes. The port director can understand the general situation after his own inspection and listening to the oral report. Most public factories do not have this regular system. Problems accumulate, and one meeting takes several hours and still cannot be finished. Daily problems still cannot be resolved in a timely manner.

	Reward and Punishment System. It is impossible to implement the responsibility system well if there is a responsibility system without inspection, or if responsibility is not investigated and rewards and punishments are not carried out in a timely manner even if inspection is carried out. Rewards and punishments must be correctly stipulated and cannot be done randomly. After Dalian Textile Factory proposed the responsibility system, the workplace cadres randomly deducted points from the workers. Some of them were unclear about right and wrong, and the punishment was very severe, which was wrong. However, if rewards and punishments are not timely, and honorary rewards are not combined with material rewards, the effect is not great. For example, issuing "thank you orders" to meritorious people and recording major demerits for those who have made mistakes will ultimately have no results, and will gradually reduce their effect. The reward and punishment system is better in the glass factory. All employees have cards, and their merits and demerits are recorded immediately every day. If there are no demerits for three months, previous mistakes can be canceled, and rewards are given at the end of the quarter according to this.

Several Conditions for Implementing the Production Responsibility System

I. To ensure the implementation of the production responsibility system, the sense of responsibility and conscious discipline of workers as masters of the country should be continuously improved. Otherwise, inspection and supervision alone will not work. At the same time, technical education should be continuously carried out to improve workers' technical ability so that they can better fulfill their responsibilities.

II. Leaders should boldly train cadres so that cadres can take the initiative and be actively responsible. If they are not comfortable letting others do things, big or small, it will cultivate an irresponsible or dare-not-be-responsible attitude among some cadres who push everything upwards.

III. Through the staff and worker representative meeting, using a democratic approach to inspect the responsibility system from the bottom up will enlighten the workers' responsible thinking as masters of the country and can inspect and establish the responsibility system.

IV. Implementing a piece-rate wage system and a progressive bonus system is a good condition for implementing the responsibility system because it aligns the production interests with the workers' personal interests, and the quality of responsibility immediately affects personal wages.

V. The implementation of the responsibility system must establish a certain production system, especially technical specifications and reward and punishment regulations.

　　旅大区各企业是如何实行生产责任制的？
    谭立
    （编者按：这篇文章原载五月五日东北日报。它所介绍的旅大区各企业实行责任制的经验，对于全国各企业都有参考的价值，特予转载。我们在文字上做了若干修改，故与原文稍有出入。）
    两种情况两种问题
    旅大企业内实行生产责任制，基本上存在着两种情况。一是中苏合营企业，严格地实行生产上各方面的专责制。制度皆系由厂方规定，赖检查与奖惩监督执行，未能成为全体工人自觉的行动。但由于执行严格，在生产上仍发生了很大的作用。一是公营企业（即系旅大行署工业厅及建新公司所属工厂），生产上无人负责的现象颇为严重，虽有制度，亦多未能贯彻。
    从以上两种情况看来，在旅大实行与贯彻责任制，存在两种问题，应从两个重点着手。在中苏企业内应加强对干部与工人的责任制教育，把生产责任制，变为工人自觉的行动。在公营企业内应从下而上揭发过去生产上无人负责的现象，转变领导，建立严格的生产责任制。广和机械工厂，为建立责任制，召开了职工代表会议，在六百三十二件提案中，有关责任制问题的占百分之六十强。在讨论中，表现出工人多愿认真负责，要求厂方也认真负责。由此可见，通过民主方式的检查，对于建立责任制，是很有作用的。
    几种责任制
    一、生产责任制
    生产专责。这是指直接生产者所负的责任要专一。这首先就要求生产分工应科学、明确。给每一工人都规定了责任性质、范围及工作时间。如玻璃工厂设立记载出产玻璃时间的事务员。每人看七台机器，共需七小时，余一小时作统计。要做好生产专责，不单要分工合理，更要按工作性质，把工作分配给适当的工人，以使他们能够胜任。在中苏合营工厂中，做重要活的皆为六、七级工人，五、六级工人为副。在公营厂内，职长、小组长有按人情分配工作的，把精密工作分给手艺低的工人，结果产生了废品。机械生产是大家分工协力，为了专责和协调，必须科学分工。在创造新纪录中，凡是有成绩的工厂，大都改进了劳动组织，建立了流水作业法。如：铁路工厂翻砂厂，按翻砂过程分为三班工作，较过去生产有秩序，且效率提高。
    机械、工具使用与修理专责。许多工厂内在牌子上写着机械使用的专责，但往往是个形式。使用人在东头工作，他的名字还挂在西头床子上；有些工厂规定了机械使用专责，但无实际检查，机械仍是不断坏，而无人追究。有些设备差的工厂，公用机械（如擦床等）由大家用，大家全不负责，坏的最快，很难追究责任。在中苏合营企业内，按照机械具体情况，订有全年修检计划，规定检查时间和修理时间。这样，既能保护机械，又能定出机械修理间隔时间，不妨碍生产。为实行此计划，除厂内机械科、车间机械员要负责外，还应实行专管、专使、专修的“三包制”。机械除定期检修外，修理工人要主动检查其专修机械，常加修理，免得发生大毛病。工人发现机械有不好使的，应找负责专修工人检修。如此，就减少了机械故障。对工具要统一保管。每个工人有三至五个工具牌子，按牌子领取使用工具。如此，既可查明使用者，又可调剂使用。
    技术指导专责。生产上的技术指导，在中苏合营企业内，由工程师（或称技师长）负主责。以玻璃工厂为例：工程师每日上午到厂，即至各车间检查生产日报，遇有技术上的问题，当即下令解决。查看后，将发生之主要问题向厂长报告，遇有厂长不同意而工程师已处理之技术问题，可请示总厂总工程师，由他决定。工程师不问行政管理工作，但对与技术工作有关之计划科、工资科、供给科、试验室等应作技术上的指导。下午，工程师指导以上各科有关工作，和查看主要车间（如熔化部）的生产情况。
    产品专责。中苏合营工厂的产品，在一定规格的要求下，都经过严密检查。如油漆工厂出品，每桶皆标有时间、班次、工人号码。一旦发生问题，即可把责任追究清楚。每日产品，皆经化验室检查，合格者，经检查员签字，方得入库。在公营工厂内多无化验室，往往不经科学检查，便大量生产，造成浪费现象。如广和机械厂制造之旋床子，自称为已达“世界二级标准”，但经自己使用，即发现不少毛病。
    原料供给和保管专责。工业原料复杂，如没有科学的管理，就会影响生产。如广和机械厂中，原料成堆，不分类，不分尺寸。你要软钢他给硬钢，甚至要钢给铁，浪费甚大。更因估工不准确，或供给原料不及时，常停工待料。购买原材料时又不试验，不少原料因不合格而作废了。在中苏合营厂内，原材料先经化验室检查，工程师始签字入库。
    二、安全责任制
    远东电业公司所属工厂严格执行了安全责任制。玻璃工厂去年半年完成全年生产任务，并节省成本三万万三千万元关东币，但在年终评级时，被降为三级企业。唯一原因是一个伙夫蒸饼子时，因自己不慎，失足落在开水锅里，烫伤两腿，该厂就受了这种处分。洋灰工厂工人在炸山时，有一石片撞在山上反撞回来，轻伤一工人。大家都认为这是一个意外的小事故，没有什么关系。但厂长很重视这件事，下令扩大安全圈，并在爆炸前发警号。近半年来未发生事故。
    有些公营工厂由于不重视安全工作，不幸事故迭次发生。建新公司去年某化学室爆炸，牺牲六名工人，伤及临近车间七名工人，至今事故原因不清。光华灯泡工厂，去年瓦斯筒爆炸，造成火灾，死三人，伤十三人，神经错乱者一人。该厂至今尚未查办负责者。这些都是不应有的现象。
    三、行政责任制
    工厂行政工作作的好坏，对生产有很大关系。如广和机械厂生产科向工人要活时，计划科尚未发下计划，闹的工人莫明其妙。大连纺织厂会计科平日工作无准备，一旦工业厅要全年预算，就将一季预算加倍造成，故不准确。在中苏合营企业内，行政责任制极其严格。如出纳员应负责使库存现金，不得超过二万元。金库只有一个负责人有权开。财务科长随时可检查其账目，稍有不符，即应负责。其他行政专责情况亦然。
    四、检查、交班、报告及奖惩制度
    检查制。某些公营工厂，有专责无检查，专责成为形式，影响生产甚大。大连纺织工厂近提出“倒检查”，即彼此监督。甲车间检查乙车间，半成品如不合规格，可不接受。在中苏合营工厂内，更有较严格的检查制。如油漆工厂在生产中，检查员隔两小时检查一次，防止出品不合规格。玻璃工厂更有“看砂子”与“记秒员”，每秒钟出品情形皆可检查清楚。
    交班制。事故常发生在两班交替互不负责的情况下。交班制可保证责任的移交，是很重要的。大连纺织厂实行三班制后，棒棉大增，但无人负责，就是未建立交班制的结果。反之，在中苏合营厂内，交班制是很严格的。如玻璃工厂某一班看窑门的工人，见有砂子“跑散”了，因差十几分钟就要交班，他就不去捞他，想推给下班。接班的工人在上班前十分钟来，先检查一遍，发现砂子已“跑散”过二道窑门，即不接班。前班工人只好捞出来，误了下班四十分钟，还受到批评。
    报告制。检查责任的另一方式是由责任者做报告。油漆工厂有产量、质量日报表，有各科各车间日志。厂长每日上班后，用二、三十分钟时间看看这些日报日志，就可明了昨日一般生产情况。大连港湾每日开报告会，早晨港长上班即巡察全港各部一周。他检查完毕，各部主要负责者即集合在港长办公室，以十分钟至二十分钟向他报告。港长经本人巡视与听取口头报告，即可了解一般情况。在公营厂内多无此经常制度，问题积累起来，一次会议几个钟头还开不完。日常问题仍不得及时解决。
    奖惩制。有责任制而无检查，或虽检查而不追究责任、不及时进行奖惩，都是不能很好贯彻责任制的。奖惩要有正确规定，不能乱来。大连纺织厂提出责任制后，职场干部随便扣工人的分。有的是非不清，就罚的很重，这都是不对的。但奖惩不及时，荣誉奖励不与物质奖励结合，也收效不大。如对有功者发“感谢令”，对有过者记大过，终无结果，慢慢便降低了作用。奖惩制以玻璃工厂为好，全厂职工皆有卡片，每日功过即时记上，三月无过，以前过错可取消，季终按此进行奖励。
    实行生产责任制的几个条件
    一、要保证生产责任制贯彻执行，应不断提高工人主人翁的责任感与自觉纪律性。否则，单靠检查、监督是不行的。应同时不断进行技术教育，以提高工人的技术能力，以便很好的尽责。
    二、领导上应放手培养干部，干部才能主动积极负责。如大小事都不放心让别人去做，就会养成某些干部一切向上推的不负责或不敢负责的态度。
    三、通过职工代表会议，以民主方式从下而上检查责任制，会启发职工主人翁的负责思想，并可检查与建立责任制。
    四、实行计件工资制与超额累进奖励制，是实行责任制的好条件，因为它使生产利益与工人个人利益结合一致，负责好坏立即影响个人工资。
    五、实行责任制必须建立一定的生产制度，尤其是技术规格与奖惩条例。
