　　The Heroic Deeds of Ferry Boatmen
　　Qi Rui

　　The heroic deeds of boatmen Huang Huahu and Zhou Zhenchao, who secretly crossed from Hainan Island to the mainland to participate in the war, are but one example among the thousands of heroic deeds of boatmen in this cross-sea battle.

　　The fleet carrying a certain unit of our army to land on Hainan Island had only sailed thirty *li* when it encountered dense fog. The wind also stopped, and the boats could not move. Soldiers and boatmen quickly picked up oars and paddles, desperately rowing forward. After sailing for twelve hours, the three boats at the front lost contact with the boats behind. By this time, dawn had broken, and the boats were approaching the coast of Daya Port. The enemy's blocking fire from the shore was fierce, and three enemy warships also opened fire from the flanks. Shells landed on both sides of the boats, causing the wooden boats to shake violently. Soldiers from the Sixth and Fifth Companies were the first to jump into the water, wading through waist-deep seawater to bravely attack the shore, seizing the beachhead. Amidst the flying artillery fire, a shell landed on one of the boats, injuring several boatmen and soldiers. Huang Huahu took out a rope and jumped into the sea; Zhou Zhenchao followed suit, and the two desperately pulled the boat forward. Dense artillery fire kicked up huge waves around them. A piece of shrapnel grazed Huang Huahu's right leg, but he still endured the pain and pulled the boat, determined to get the soldiers ashore to fight quickly.

　　When the landing troops solved two bunkers and occupied the beachhead, the enemy hiding in the other four bunkers were still firing madly. Huang Huahu and Zhou Zhenchao led other boatmen to carry the wounded onto the boat and find a sheltered place. They comforted the wounded, saying, "We won't lose you as long as we're here, comrades, don't worry!"

　　The troops surged inland, moving further and further away from the coast. At this time, enemy planes came to strafe and bomb the shore. In this tense situation, Huang Huahu knew that it would be very difficult to risk crossing over a hundred *li* of sea to send the boat back to the north shore. But looking at the wounded, thinking about the people on the shore longing for the People's Liberation Army, and his own plan to earn merit, he bravely decided: resolutely send the wounded back to the north shore, and then transport the People's Liberation Army across the sea, one boat, two boats, three boats at a time. His plan was immediately supported by the other fourteen boatmen. The three wooden boats braved enemy strafing and bombing, quickly leaving the coast and heading for the sea. The boatmen vigorously rowed and paddled, heading north against the wind. Everyone had not eaten or rested for a day and a night, and their clothes were soaked with seawater. But the heroic boatmen endured extreme fatigue and hunger, and finally safely sent the three sailboats and eight wounded back to the north shore.

　　When the commanders and fighters welcomed them ashore, the boatmen were so exhausted that they were limp and their legs could no longer stand. The commanders and fighters helped them ashore, and after listening to their account of the crossing, they were deeply moved by the heroic deeds of the boatmen brothers. At the celebration and welcoming meeting, the leaders personally awarded bonuses to all the boatmen who had returned victoriously. But Huang Huahu and Zhou Zhenchao politely declined, saying, "The great army helping us common people liberate Hainan Island is a greater favor than anything. We voluntarily came from Hainan Island to transport the great army across the sea; we should do our best to send the great army over there."

　　渡海船工们的英勇事迹
    其瑞
    由海南岛潜渡到大陆来参战的船工黄华户、周振朝两人的英勇事迹，是这次渡海战中，千百件船工英勇事迹中的一件。
    载军某部登陆海南岛的船队，只航行了三十里，就碰上了浓雾，风也停了，船也走不动了。战士、船工赶快拿起橹、桨，拚命划行前进。航行十二小时后，走在前头的三只船和后面的船失掉了联系。这时天已破晓，船只正向大雅港海岸迫近。岸上敌人的阻击火力猛烈射来，三只敌舰也从侧翼开炮轰击。炮弹落在船舷两旁，木船引起了剧烈的震动。六连、五连的战士们首先跳下水，涉过齐腰深的海水奋勇地攻击上岸，夺取滩头阵地。炮火纷飞中，一只船上落了一颗炮弹，几个船工和战士受伤了。黄华户拿出绳子，跳进海里；周振朝也跟着跳下去，两人拚命拉船前进。密集的炮火在他们周围掀起巨大的浪花。一块炮弹片擦伤了黄华户的右腿，但他仍然忍着痛拉船，一心要使战士们迅速登陆作战。
    当登陆部队一连解决两个地堡而占领了滩头阵地时，藏在另外四个地堡的敌人还在疯狂射击。黄华户、周振朝又带领其他船工把伤员抬上船找好荫蔽的地方。他们安慰着伤员说：“有我们就丢不掉你们，同志们放心吧！”
    部队汹涌地向着纵深发展，离海岸越来越远。这时敌机却来岸边扫射和轰炸。在这样紧张的情况下，黄华户知道要冒险横渡百余里大海把船送回北岸是一件很困难的事情。但他看看伤员，想想岸上人民对人民解放军的渴待和自己的立功计划，于是勇敢地决定：坚决把伤员送回北岸，然后再一船、两船、三船地载运解放军渡海作战。他的这个计划，立刻获得其他十四个船工的拥护。三只木船冒着敌机的扫射和轰炸，很快地离开了海岸驶奔大海。船工们奋力地摇橹、划桨，顶着风向北驶。每个人都是一天一夜没有吃饭和休息，衣服都被海水浸透了。但英勇的船工们忍受着极度的疲劳和饥饿，终于将三只风船和八名伤员安全地送回了北岸。
    当指战员们欢迎他们上岸时，船工们已经累得浑身瘫软，两腿已经站立不住。指战员们搀扶他们上了岸，听了他们讲述渡海的情景以后，对船工兄弟们这一段的英雄事迹都深为感动。在庆功欢迎会上，首长亲自给所有胜利归来的船工们颁发奖金。但黄华户和周振朝却婉谢不受，并表示说：“大军帮助我们老百姓解放海南岛比什么恩情都大。我们是自愿从海南岛过来载运大军渡海的，我们应当出力把大军送过去。”
