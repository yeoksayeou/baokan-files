Xinhua News Agency, May 30th: On May 28th, a grand demonstration and parade of over 500,000 youths from all over Germany took place in Berlin, demonstrating the strong will of German youth not to be sacrificial pawns in the imperialist war of aggression. According to reports from Berlin: Starting early in the morning of the 28th, Berlin's major streets were filled with people. Youths from all over the country, wearing conference uniforms, marched in formation past the reviewing stand where the heads of the Democratic Republic government and diplomatic envoys were standing, proceeding along Berlin's main street—Unter den Linden. The marching columns carried the black, red, and yellow national flag of the Republic and red flags, and held aloft huge portraits of the Republic's leaders and Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong, etc. As the procession moved forward, hundreds of doves symbolizing peace were released, soaring over Berlin. The youths cheered excitedly, shouting slogans such as "We want peace!" "Friendship with the Soviet Union!" "Americans, get out!" The demonstration and parade lasted all day, with the last contingent of the march starting at 5:00 PM.

At the conference before the parade, the President of the Republic, Wilhelm Pieck, delivered a speech to the hundreds of thousands of people attending the conference, exposing the war preparations of Western countries and their conspiracy to turn Germany into a new battlefield, driving German youth to serve as cannon fodder. Amid cheers, the conference adopted a telegram of respect to Marshal Stalin, assuring him that German youth would do their utmost to stop the war, defend peace, and maintain German-Soviet friendship.
