Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 19th: United Nations Secretary-General Trygve Lie held a press conference on the afternoon of the 17th. During the conference, our reporter asked Lie: "Have you received the telegram of May 12th from Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China? Have you replied or how will you reply?" Lie replied: "The telegram of May 12th addressed to me was received by my assistant in New York. I understand that he has sent a copy of the telegram to the specialized organizations named in the telegram; however, I do not yet know what action these specialized organizations will take."

Our reporter further asked: "On January 19th, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China appointed Zhang Wentian as the chief representative of the People's Republic of China to the United Nations. What steps have you taken or will you take to enable him to attend United Nations meetings?" Lie replied: "Mr. Sinhenko (note: Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations) is more familiar with this matter than I am. I know that the telegram appointing Zhang Wentian has been distributed to the members of the Security Council; however, this issue has not yet been placed on the agenda. The telegram is currently under review by the Security Council."

TASS reporter also asked Lie: "Was your conversation with Wang Jiaxiang, Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the Soviet Union, of positive significance?" Lie replied: "My meeting with the Chinese Ambassador was related to a specific issue. Prior to this, I had not met any representative of the Beijing government, so my written statement did not mention the conversation with the Chinese Ambassador. The content of our conversation is not public. I cannot disclose its details."

TASS reporter further asked: "Did you request the conversation with the Ambassador of the People's Republic of China, or did he request it?"

Lie replied: "I requested it."

　　赖伊答我记者问
    【新华社莫斯科十九日电】联合国秘书长赖伊于十七日下午举行记者招待会时，本社记者曾向赖伊发问：“你是否已收到五月十二日中华人民共和国外长周恩来给你的电报，你已否答复或将如何答复？”赖伊答道：“五月十二日给我的电报是我的助手在纽约收到的。我知道他已把该电副本，寄交该电所指名的各专门组织；但是我还不知道这些专门组织将采取何种行动。”
    本社记者又问：“一月十九日中华人民共和国中央人民政府委派张闻天为中华人民共和国出席联合国的首席代表，你已采取了或将采取什么步骤，使他出席联合国会议？”赖伊答称：“辛琴科先生（按系联合国助理秘书长）比我更熟悉这件事。我知道委派张闻天的电报，业经分发给安理会各理事；但这个问题，还没有列入议程。这封电报暂时还在安理会审查中。”
    电通社记者亦询问赖伊：“你和中华人民共和国驻苏大使王稼祥的谈话，是否具有积极意义？”赖伊答：“我之会见中国大使系与特殊问题有关。在此以前，我还没有见过任何北京政府的代表，所以我的书面谈话里并没有提及和中国大使的谈话。我们谈话的内容是不公开的。我不能发表它的细节。”
    电通社记者又问：“你跟中华人民共和国大使的谈话，是你约的还是他约的？”
    赖伊答：“是我约的。”
