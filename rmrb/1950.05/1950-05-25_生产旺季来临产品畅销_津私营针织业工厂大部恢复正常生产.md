Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 24th: With the arrival of the peak production season and improved product sales, most private electric knitting factories in Tianjin have resumed normal production. There are a total of twenty-three private electric knitting factories in Tianjin, most of which were in a state of semi-shutdown in late March. Since the beginning of the peak season in early April, the number of purchasers from public and private enterprises in various regions has been increasing, and sales have been even better since May. For example, Ruixingyuanji Electric Knitting Factory has received orders for 6,000 dozens of undershirts and singlets from the North China Department Store in April and May. The factory started night shift production on the 16th of last month and expanded production by adding four machines. After the North China Department Store purchased more than 3,000 dozens of socks from Daxiang Knitting Company, it received another order for 1,000 dozens of socks from the North China Department Store in early May. At present, most factories in this industry have resumed normal production. In addition to working hard to produce and supply the needs of various regions, the factories are also studying how to improve quality in order to lay the foundation for future product sales.
