District Cadre Leadership Ineffective in Cotton Planting
Jin County Government Should Pay Attention to Inspection

Since the start of cotton planting in Jin County, Hebei Province, some district cadres have been irresponsible in leading cotton planting, which has seriously affected the work. Jin County is a well-known cotton-producing area. As long as the cadres work hard and lead in a planned way, they can complete the task of planting 300,000 mu of cotton. However, due to the above reasons, it is questionable whether the county can complete this task. Although the County Party Committee issued a call long ago: "During the spring plowing and sowing period, cadres are not allowed to go home" (except in special circumstances), nine cadres in the Third District went home for one and a half months, including the District Party Committee Organization Member and the Public Security Officer, who went home privately on the way back to the district after attending the county production meeting; Zhang Saiying of the County Water Conservancy Promotion Agency went to visit relatives for two days before going to the countryside. Yang Rong, Deputy Secretary of the Fifth District Party Committee, left his work and went home for two days to plant his own land; Hu Yingkui, the Construction Assistant of the district, secretly went to a village in Shulu to mess around with a woman while leading the cotton planting, and still just slept and did not work after returning to the village (the county government is dealing with this matter). The above situation shows how irresponsible some district cadres in Jin County are towards the important political task of stepping up the leadership of cotton planting! The leading organs of the county should pay close attention to this issue and give these irresponsible cadres the necessary criticism and punishment.

　　区干部领导种棉不力
　　晋县县府应注意检查
    河北省晋县自种棉开始后，部分区干部对领导种棉不负责任，使种棉工作受到了严重的影响。晋县本是有名的产棉区，只要干部努力，有计划的进行领导，就能完成种棉三十万亩的任务。但由于上述原因，全县是否能完成这个任务，就很成问题。虽然县委早就号召：“春耕播种期间，干部不许回家”（有特殊情况者例外），但三区有九个干部竟回家一个半月，其中区委组织委员、公安员也在开完县生产会议回区途中私自回家；县水利推进社张赛英下乡途中，先串亲两天。五区区委副书记杨荣，放下工作不管，回家两天去种自己的地；该区建设助理员胡英魁，在领导种棉时，偷偷到束鹿某村去搞女人，回村后还是光睡觉，不工作（县政府正在处理此事）。以上情况说明：晋县部分区干部对加紧领导种棉的重大政治任务是多么不负责任！该县领导机关对这问题应引起高度注意，并分别给这些不负责任的干部以必要的批评与处分。（刘荫桐、张德纯、广林、克明）
