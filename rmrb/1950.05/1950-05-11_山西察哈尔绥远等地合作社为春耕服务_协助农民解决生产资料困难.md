Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Cooperatives in Shanxi, Chahar, and Suiyuan provinces are vigorously transferring agricultural tools, fertilizers, and livestock to assist the vast number of farmers in solving difficulties with the means of production during spring plowing. According to statistics from eighteen counties in Changzhi, Yuci and other places in Shanxi, twenty-two counties in Wanquan, Hunyuan and other places in Chahar, and some areas of Suiyuan, as of early April, 400,000 pieces of various agricultural tools and more than 200,000 catties of wrought iron have been supplied to cooperative members and general farmers; Shanxi and Chahar have also supplied farmers with nearly 3 million catties of fertilizer and 250,000 catties of various insecticides; Suiyuan and Chahar supplied more than 328,000 catties of white wine and alcohol for soaking oat seeds; Shanxi supplied 1,018 head of livestock and 55,000 catties of improved seeds; Chahar supplied more than 10,000 catties of fertilizer.

When transferring these means of production, cooperatives in various places generally cooperate closely with state-owned economic departments or neighboring cooperatives through contracts, and widely organize exchanges. For example, cooperatives in Huguan, Lucheng, Xiangyuan, Jincheng, Lingchuan and other places in Shanxi have signed contracts to exchange means of production with each other, enabling Huguan to sell alum and millet in exchange for plowshares and fertilizers for its members; Lucheng sold plowshares, Xiangyuan sold millet, and Lingchuan sold fertilizer, all of which bought back insecticides; Jincheng sold plowshares and exchanged them for rice for unemployed workers. This kind of barter directly solved the supply and demand needs of various regions.

Secondly, supply and marketing cooperatives cooperated with the National Bank to use loans in an organized manner. For example, the Yangcheng County Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Shanxi centrally controlled bank loans, and after understanding the shortage of manure buckets, livestock and other means of production in each village through investigations by district and village cooperatives, the county, district, and village cooperatives jointly purchased them from other counties. Supply and marketing cooperatives in Chahar and other places lend various means of production to members or general farmers who are unable to purchase them at fair prices; then the farmers turn to a loan relationship with the bank, and return the principal and interest when due. In order to ensure that agricultural tools meet the needs of the masses, supply and marketing cooperatives in Chahar and cooperatives in Lucheng, Jiexiu, Huoxian, Pingshun, Yangcheng and other places in Shanxi, according to the masses' requirements for the style and type of agricultural tools, use bank loans to organize blacksmiths and carpenters to manufacture according to the samples, so the masses are happy to borrow, and this ensures the concentrated use of bank loans and their use for designated purposes.

　　山西察哈尔绥远等地合作社为春耕服务
    协助农民解决生产资料困难
    【新华社八日讯】山西、察哈尔、绥远三省各地供销合作社大力调剂农具、肥料和牲畜等，协助广大农民在春耕中解决生产资料的困难。据山西长治、榆次等十八个县，察哈尔万全、浑源等二十二个县及绥远部分地区的统计，迄四月上旬止，已供给社员和一般农民以各种农具四十万件，熟铁二十余万斤；山西和察哈尔并供给农民肥料近三百万斤，各种杀虫药剂二十五万斤；绥远、察哈尔供给莜麦浸种用的白酒及酒精三十二万八千余斤；山西供给牲畜一千零十八头，优良种籽五万五千斤；察哈尔供给肥料一万余斤。
    各地合作社在调剂这些生产资料时，一般都与国营经济部门或友邻区合作社通过订立合同取得密切配合，广泛组织交换，如山西的壶关、潞城、襄垣、晋城、陵川等地合作社相互订立了交换生产资料的合同，使壶关推销了黑矾和小米，换回了社员的犁面、犁铧和肥料；潞城推销了犁铧，襄垣推销了小米，陵川推销了肥料，都买回了杀虫药剂；晋城推销了犁铧，换回了失业工人的吃米。这种实物交换，直接解决了各地区的供求需要。
    其次，供销社又与国家银行相配合，有组织地使用贷款。如山西阳城县供销社集中掌握银行贷款，通过区、村社的调查，了解了各村共同缺少粪桶、牲畜等生产资料的情况以后，由县、区、村社联合到外县统一购买。察哈尔等地供销社则将各种生产资料以公平价格贷给无力购买的社员或一般农民；再由农民与银行转为借贷关系，到期归本还息。为保证农具合乎群众的需要，察哈尔供销社及山西的潞城、介休、霍县、平顺、阳城等地合作社，更根据群众对农具样式、种类等要求，使用银行贷款，组织铁匠、木匠按样制造，群众因而乐于借贷，并因此保证了银行贷款的集中使用和专款专用。
