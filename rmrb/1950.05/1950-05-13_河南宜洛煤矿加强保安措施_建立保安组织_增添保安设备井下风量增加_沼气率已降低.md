[Kaifeng News] According to the Henan Daily on April 27th: The state-owned Yiluo Coal Mine in Henan Province has learned from the methane explosion in February and is actively establishing security organizations, adding necessary equipment for safety, fire prevention, and measuring air volume and various gases. It has also established security regulations. Currently, the underground air volume has increased, and the methane content has relatively decreased.

The mine's natural deficiency is that the current mining area is close to a fault, and historically methane levels have been very high. From 1946 to 1948, there were four explosions of varying sizes. The mine lacked an inspection system. Coal foremen and team leaders collectively stole coal, damaging projects and causing serious phenomena such as roof collapses, air leaks, and the collapse of shed pillars blocking roadways. The mine's extraction method was purely traditional, relying entirely on natural ventilation. Because the roadways were long, the airflow was weak, leading to methane accumulation and increased temperatures. The mine also lacked proper technical guidance, and coal excavation did not adhere to specifications. The mine did not even have the most basic compass for measuring wind speed. It had seven safety lamps, but none were ever used.

After the disaster in February, the mine's engineers conducted a comprehensive inspection and researched improvements to safety measures. On March 4th, an emergency security meeting was held, establishing a security section, determining security measures, formulating security regulations and codes of conduct, and assigning dedicated personnel to be responsible for testing, patrolling, and inspecting underground areas, warehouses, electrical and mechanical equipment, and lamp rooms. The security regulations and codes of conduct were included in the employees' study curriculum to universally strengthen safety education. At the same time, a security log and a system of daily reports and monthly meetings were established to implement regular inspections. Safe havens were opened, and insurance doors were installed in safe underground areas. Fire prevention, waterproofing, ventilation, and other security equipment were added.

The mine has added more than 700 acidic mine lamps, seven methane safety lamps, one anemometer, three three-inch steam pumps, and one one-inch steam pump underground. It is also preparing to add safety and fire prevention equipment and facilities for measuring and managing air volume and various gases. It also plans to install electric exhaust fans in separate zones, as well as water gates, water storage tanks, air compressors, fire extinguishers, resuscitators, and methane and carbon dioxide detectors. Dedicated personnel are responsible for measuring air volume and various gases for each shift and each well. Since strengthening security work, the underground air volume in the mine has increased from 2.3 cubic meters per person per minute to 2.6 cubic meters. The methane content at the work front has decreased from 3.1 percent to below 2 percent. Incidents of pressure-related injuries have also decreased.

　　河南宜洛煤矿加强保安措施
　　建立保安组织·增添保安设备井下风量增加·沼气率已降低
    【开封讯】据河南日报四月二十七日讯：国营河南宜洛煤矿接受二月间沼气爆炸事件的教训，积极建立保安组织，添置安全、防火、测量风量及各种气体的必需设备。并订立了保安规程。现井下风量增加，沼气含有率已相对减少。
    该矿的天然缺陷是现采区域接近断层，历来沼气很大。自一九四六年至一九四八年，即发生大小爆炸四次。矿上缺乏检查制度。煤师、大组长又集体偷煤，破坏工程，引起了塌帮冒顶，漏风及棚柱倒坍阻塞巷道等严重现象。该矿纯为土法开采，全靠自然通风，因巷道长风流无力，致沼气聚集，热度增高。井下技术指导不良，掘煤不遵守规格。矿上连最起码的罗盘测风表都没有。有七个安全灯，但均未用过。
    二月间的灾变发生后，该矿工程师已作全面检查，研究改进安全措施。三月四日又召开紧急保安会议，成立了保安股，确定保安办法，制定保安规程和守则，并设专人担负测验、巡场及井下、仓库、机电、灯房等检查责任。将保安规程和守则列入职工学习课题，普遍加强安全教育。同时，建立了保安日志及每日汇报、每月会议等制度，实施定期检查。开辟安全避难所，就井下安全地带装置保险门。增加防火、防水、通风及其他保安设备。
    该矿井下已增设酸性矿灯七百余盏、检查沼气安全灯七盏，测风仪一部、三寸汽泵三部，一寸汽泵一部；并准备添设安全、防火设备，对风量与各种气体的测定与管理设施。还准备分区装设电动抽风机。水闸门，蓄水仓，压风机，灭火器、苏生器，沼气与氧化碳检定器等。对风量及各种气体的测定，每班每井各设专人负责。自加强保安工作后，该矿井下风量已由每人每分钟二·三立方公尺增至二·六立方公尺。工作前线之沼气含有率已由百分之三·一减至百分之二以下。跌压损伤情事亦已减少。
