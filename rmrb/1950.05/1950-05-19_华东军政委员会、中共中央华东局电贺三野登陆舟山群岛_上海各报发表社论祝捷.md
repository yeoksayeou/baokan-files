Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 18th: The East China Military and Political Committee and the CCP Central Committee East China Bureau recently sent a telegram congratulating the Third Field Army on its victory in landing on Zhoushan and liberating Dinghai. The text of the telegram is as follows: To the Headquarters and Political Department of the Third Field Army and forwarded to all commanders and fighters of the Zhoushan Front:

Following the glorious victory of our Fourth Field Army brothers in completely liberating Hainan Island, you landed on Zhoushan Island in its entirety on the 17th, liberating Shenjiamen, Linggang Town, Dinghai County, and islands surrounding the main island such as Cezi Mountain, and removed the forward base for the U.S.-Chiang blockade and bombing against us; and created favorable conditions for liberating Taiwan and finally eliminating the remnants of the Chiang bandits. We hope you will continue your efforts to complete the glorious combat mission entirely. We hereby send our congratulations.

                                              East China Military and Political Committee
                                              CCP Central Committee East China Bureau
                                                  May 18th

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 18th: Shanghai newspapers on the 18th successively published commentaries, expressing warm celebration for the major victory of completely breaking the remnant bandits' blockade of Shanghai with the liberation of Zhoushan. The Liberation Daily editorial stated: "In the ten-plus months that the bandit gang occupied Dinghai, they owed the people of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai countless debts of blood! Taking Shanghai alone, the losses of life and property and the difficulties in production caused by the blockade since June 23rd of last year and the bombing on February 6th of this year have been extremely great." "The liberation of Dinghai is of great significance to East China, especially to Shanghai. After the base for the remnant bandits' blockade and bombing of Shanghai and nearby cities is removed, the destructive activities of the remnant bandits will be severely hit, which will be conducive to the restoration of production in Shanghai and other places. More importantly, the liberation of Dinghai has created favorable conditions for the liberation of Taiwan. With the successive liberation of Hainan and Zhoushan, Taiwan has become an isolated island, like a body without limbs, while we have obtained favorable conditions and valuable experience for crossing the sea and liberating Taiwan."

The Ta Kung Pao commentary stated: "Now our People's Liberation Army has liberated Zhoushan. From Shanghai's point of view, the remnant bandits' blockade and bombing have been eliminated, and a major factor in Shanghai's current difficulties has been resolved. We, the people of Shanghai, sincerely thank the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army. We, the people of Shanghai, will welcome this glorious victory with full confidence, more actively support the front, and strive to further liberate Taiwan and completely eliminate the Chiang bandit gang!"

The Wenhui Daily editorial stated: "The greatest significance of this victory is that it has shattered the enemy's arrogant plan to use Zhoushan to carry out bombing and blockade. Although the enemy can still continue to do evil using Taiwan in the future, its rampant power has been greatly weakened. We have taken a big step forward in the task of anti-bombing and anti-blockade."

　　华东军政委员会、中共中央华东局电贺三野登陆舟山群岛       
    上海各报发表社论祝捷
    【新华社上海十八日电】华东军政委员会暨中共中央华东局顷电贺第三野战军登陆舟山解放定海的胜利。电文如下：第三野战军司令部政治部并转舟山前线部队全体指战员：
    继四野兄弟部队全部解放海南岛的光辉胜利之后，你们于十七日全部登陆舟山本岛，一举解放沈家门、岭港镇及定海县城与本岛周围的册子山等岛，拔除了美蒋对我封锁与轰炸的前哨基地；并为解放台湾、最后消灭蒋匪残余势力创造了有利条件。希望你们再接再厉，为继续完成全部的光荣战斗任务而努力，特此电贺。
                                              华东军政委员会
                                              中共中央华东局
                                                  五月十八日
    【新华社上海十八日电】上海各报十八日纷纷发表评论，对随着舟山解放而来的完全打破残匪对上海封锁的重大胜利，表示热烈的庆祝。解放日报的社论说：“匪帮盘踞在定海的十个多月中，对江浙两省和上海人民欠下了数不清的血债！单以上海而论，从去年六月二十三日的封锁以来和今年二月六日的轰炸所造成的生命财产的损失和生产的困难是极为巨大的。”“定海的解放，对华东各地特别是对上海是有重大意义的。残余匪帮对上海及附近城市的封锁与轰炸的基地被拔除之后，残匪的破坏行为就受到严重的打击，这将有利于上海等地的生产恢复。更重要的是定海解放以后，创造了解放台湾的有利条件。海南、舟山相继解放，台湾就成为孤悬的一岛，等于没有了手足的躯体，而我们则得到了渡海解放台湾的有利条件和宝贵经验。”
    大公报评论说：“现在我人民解放军已将舟山解放。这由上海来说，残匪的封锁与轰炸消灭了，上海当前困难的一大因素解除了。我们上海人民衷心感激人民解放军的伟大功勋，我们上海人民更以充分的信心来迎接这一光辉胜利，更积极的支援前线，以争取进一步解放台湾，彻底消灭蒋匪帮！”
    文汇报社论说：“这胜利最大的意义，是粉碎了敌人利用舟山实施轰炸与封锁的狂妄计划。尽管此后敌人还可以利用台湾继续作恶，但是它横行的力量已非常萎缩。我们在反轰炸反封锁的任务上已经大大前进了一步。
