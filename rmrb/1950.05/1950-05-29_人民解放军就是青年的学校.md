　　The People's Liberation Army is a School for Youth

　　In the East China Military Region and the Third Field Army, about 60 percent of the officers and soldiers are young people. Under the cultivation and education of the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, they are constantly improving their political awareness and cultural level. They are an important backbone force in tasks such as combat, training, production, and learning. A large number of outstanding young people have joined the New Democratic Youth League or the Communist Party.

　　Lin Maocheng and Liu Kuiji: The Banners of Youth Learning

　　Lin Maocheng, the East China combat hero who attended the First World Democratic Youth Congress in Prague in 1947 (who gloriously sacrificed himself on the Zhejiang East Front), was a poor cowherd before joining the revolution. After eleven years of arduous struggle and the cultivation and education of the Party, he rose from soldier, squad leader, platoon leader, and company commander to become an excellent battalion commander. He led his troops to complete 18 main assault missions, was wounded 12 times, and had more than 22 scars all over his body, becoming a banner for all officers and soldiers to learn from. Liu Kuiji, the East China First-Class People's Hero who attended the Second World Democratic Youth Congress in Budapest in 1949, was a young coolie worker in the past, but now he has become an excellent battalion commander. The sixteen scars on his body and his crippled right hand are glorious symbols of his loyalty to the people's revolutionary cause.

　　Engaging in Arduous Study to Master Modern Technology

　　With the development of the war situation and the needs of military construction, in the special column, young artillerymen, drivers, and tank operators, when learning new weapons, drew the mechanical parts in their notebooks, wrote the English names on their arms, and engaged in arduous study day and night next to tanks, artillery, and tractors, and finally skillfully mastered modern technology. Young engineers worked day and night to build bridges, roads, and docks, clearing obstacles on the battlefield, and ensuring the victorious advance of the powerful combat troops.

　　In the young East China People's Navy, young engine operators, gunners, and sailors, as a result of hard work, learned complex navigation technology in just a few months.

　　In various positions in the logistics department, many young heroes and models have also emerged, such as Li Landing, the female model medical team leader who attended the International Democratic Women's Congress, and Jiang Nanping, the female medical worker who was awarded a special merit and attended the National Women's Congress. Under their leadership and influence, young people carried out tasks such as sanitation, transportation, supply, and production, ensuring the completion of various arduous combat tasks of the fighting troops.

　　The Number of Youth League Members in the Army Now Exceeds 30,000

　　In the past six months, more than 30,000 outstanding young people in the army have joined the New Democratic Youth League. At the Youth Work Conference held by the army in March this year, the policy of gradually establishing the League universally was determined, and the organization and strength of the League are developing rapidly.

　　In various military factories in the logistics department, an average of more than 30 percent of young workers have joined the Youth League, and they have become the backbone force in actively responding to the call of the Party and the factory and completing various production tasks. In the red flag competition carried out by the clothing factory, 85 percent of the League members won the red flag. Youth League members are also active responders to the call to "improve and improve technology and create new production records." Under the help of veteran Communist Party members and workers, they united all young workers and achieved significant results in research and improvement of technology. Mao Sidong, a Youth League member and fitter in a certain ordnance factory, improved tools and operating methods, increasing daily output fivefold. Youth League members Shi Yinnan and Wang Changren, with the help of the model He Zongrong, modified the signal flare flat-top machine, increasing output more than threefold.

　　A Large Number of Intellectual Youths Join the Troops

　　Since crossing the Yangtze River last year, a large number of intellectual youths have poured into the troops. They are actively studying and transforming their thinking in schools or work positions, determined to train themselves into strong soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. When tens of thousands of young people at the East China Military and Political University graduated from preparatory courses, 50 percent of the students in the school joined the Youth League. Youth League members are not only the backbone force in labor production and cultural and recreational activities, but also learning models admired by all students. At the end of the preparatory course, among the 625 students in the Second Corps who were considered to have made significant progress, Youth League members accounted for 87 percent. At present, young people throughout the army are engaged in arduous study in different work or study positions, striving to liberate Taiwan and eliminate the remnants of the enemy along the southeast coast. These excellent young people are not only the backbone of the construction of the National Defense Force, but also talents in various aspects of the construction of the new China.

　　人民解放军就是青年的学校
    在华东军区和第三野战军部队中，有百分之六十左右的指战员是青年。他们在共产党和解放军的培养教育下，不断地提高自己的政治觉悟和文化水平。他们在作战、练兵、生产、学习等任务中，都是一支重要的骨干力量。大批的优秀青年已经参加了新民主主义青年团或共产党。
    林茂成、刘奎基青年的学习旗帜
    一九四七年出席布拉格世界民主青年第一次代表大会的华东战斗英雄林茂成（已在浙东前线光荣牺牲），参加革命前是一个贫苦的牧牛孩子。在十一年的艰苦斗争和党的培养教育下，他从战士、班长、排长、连长、升为优秀的营指挥员。他曾带领部队完成十八次主攻任务，负伤十二次，全身伤痕达二十二处之多，成为全军指战员学习的旗帜。一九四九年出席布达佩斯世界民主青年第二次代表大会的华东一级人民英雄刘奎基，过去是一个年青的苦力工人，现在已成为优秀的营指挥员，他身上的十六处伤痕和残废的右手，是他忠实于人民革命事业的光荣的标帜。
    进行艰苦学习掌握近代技术
    随着战争形势的发展与军事建设的需要，在特种纵队中年青的炮兵、驾驶员、坦克手们，在学习新武器时，曾把机械的零件画在本子上，把英文名称写在手臂上，日夜在坦克、大炮、牵引车旁边进行艰苦的学习，终于熟练地掌握了近代化技术。年青的工兵们日夜修筑着桥梁、道路和码头，扫清着战场上的障碍，保证了强大战斗部队的胜利前进。
    在年青的华东人民海军中青年轮机手、枪炮手、帆缆手们，由于努力学习的结果，在短短的几个月内就学会了复杂的航海技术。
    在后勤部门的各个不同工作岗位上，也出现了许多青年英雄和模范。像出席国际民主妇女代表大会的女模范医疗队长李蓝丁和出席全国妇女代表大会的特等功臣女医务员蒋南屏。在她们的带头影响下，青年们执行着卫生、运输、供给、生产等任务，保证了战斗部队各种艰巨战斗任务的完成。
    全军青年团员现已超过三万
    全军半年以来已有三万多优秀青年参加了新民主主义青年团。今年三月全军召开的青年工作会议上，确定了逐步普遍建团的方针，团的组织与力量正在飞快的发展着。
    在后勤各军工工厂中，青年工人们平均有百分之三十以上参加了青年团，他们成为积极响应党和工厂号召和完成各种生产任务的骨干力量。被服厂开展的红旗竞赛中有百分之八十五的团员获得了红旗。青年团员同时又是“提高与改进技术创造生产新纪录”的积极响应者，他们在老共产党员和工人的帮助下，团结了全体青年工人，在研究与改进技术上获得重大成绩。某军械厂青年团员钳工毛四栋等改进工具和操作方法，使日产量提高了五倍。青年团员史银南、王昌仁等在创造模范何宗荣的帮助下改装信号弹平顶机，使产量增加三倍以上。
    大批知识青年参加部队工作
    自去年渡江以后，大批的知识青年涌进了部队。他们正在学校或工作岗位上积极学习，改造思想，决心把自己锻炼成坚强的人民解放军的战士。华东军政大学的数万青年们在预科结业时，全校有百分之五十的青年参加了青年团。青年团员们不仅是劳动生产、文化娱乐活动中的骨干力量，也是全校同学所钦佩的学习模范。在预科结业时，在二总队的同学中被认为有显著进步的六百二十五个同学中，青年团员占百分之八十七。目前全军青年正在不同的工作或学习岗位上进行艰苦的学习，为解放台湾、肃清东南沿海残敌而努力。这些优秀的青年不仅是建设国防军的骨干，而且也将是新中国建设中各方面的人材。
