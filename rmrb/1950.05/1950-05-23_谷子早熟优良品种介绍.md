Introduction to Excellent Early-Maturing Millet Varieties
    Liu Shilin
    Early-maturing millet varieties are relatively scattered and complex. Based on local cultivation habits, the naming of varieties is often inconsistent. Some are named according to the maturity period, such as "Sixty Days to Return Home" and "Seventy Days"; some are named according to different traits, such as "Long Neck" and "Small Iron Pestle"; some are named according to yield, such as "Get Rich Red" and "Three Stone Standard"; some are named according to the source of the seeds, such as "Qin Zhou Millet" and "Laiwu Yellow"; some are named according to adaptability, such as "Drought-Resistant Millet" and "Hai Li Zhan"; and some, although the names are the same, have different traits, so "hairy" or "hairless," "green stalk," or "red stalk," and "loose ear" or "tight ear" are added to distinguish the two varieties. According to surveys, if classified by traits, there are about a hundred varieties. Shandong Province alone has more than thirty varieties. Here are just a few of the excellent varieties.

    (1) Bian Yi Gu (Border One Millet)
    "Bian Yi Gu" or "Border Region No. 1 Millet," is an early-maturing improved variety suitable for cultivation in western Hebei Province. Last year, more than 1,300 mu were planted in western Hebei and Chahar Southern areas (including 750 jin of seeds promoted by various farms in the 11th District of Hebei Province and more than 6,000 jin of seeds promoted in the Dingxian District), and more than 47,000 jin of millet seeds were selected and harvested after autumn, which can be sown on 3,000 mu this year. It originated in 1943 when the former Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region Second Farm selected it from early-maturing varieties of farmers in western Hebei.

    Traits: The stalk is yellowish-white, the internodes are relatively short and not very thick, the height is three to four chi, the leaves are dark green, narrow and long, relatively dense, and stretch upwards. The branching ability is strong, with seven to eight branches per plant. The ear shape is like a rat's tail, and the spikelets are not very tight. The ear color is yellow with slightly pointed tips and hairs. The rice grains are medium to large in size, yellow in color and shiny, and the rice bran is golden yellow.

    Its advantages are late planting and early maturity, suitable for planting after wheat, and two crops can be harvested in one year. The growing period is 75 days (according to a survey in Yixian area last year, it only takes 70 days to mature). The yield is high, with an average yield of 300 to 350 jin per mu. It can resist stem borers and white leaf blight (observation of old millet), and because the ears have hairs, it is not afraid of wind erosion. The rice yield is relatively high, with 75 jin of rice that can be milled from every 100 jin of millet. The rice is yellow and delicious.

    Cultivation of Bian Yi Gu: Both paddy and dry land are suitable. Prepare the land well before sowing and apply 4,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. Sowing can be done in mid-to-late June. This year, the soil is moist, so seeds should be sown around June 10th. The amount of seeds used per mu is 1.5 jin. If there are mole crickets, 2 jin of seeds per mu can be used. Sowing should not be too deep, a depth of one cun is appropriate. It will germinate and emerge eight to nine days after sowing. When the seedlings are more than two cun high, thinning should be carried out. Bian Yi Gu has many tillers and is suitable for leaving single plants, that is, leaving one plant every eight cun. Two plants can be left in barren land, but not too many, to avoid poor growth.

    After planting, it is necessary to strengthen management, the most important thing is weeding. The number of cultivation times should be four. Select seeds in the field before harvesting, divide and thresh them, and prepare for next year's seeds.

    (2) Xiao Chun Gu (Small Spring Millet)
    "Xiao Chun Gu" is a variety commonly planted by farmers in the central Hebei area. Because it matures early, it can be used for emergency relief, so the cultivation area is relatively wide, and farmers generally preserve the seeds.

    Traits: The roots of the seedlings are purplish. The stalk is three to four chi high, and the ear is slender, about seven to eight cun long. The rice grains are small, light yellow, the rice bran is yellow, and the skin is thick. There are not many tillers, two to three per plant. Both irrigated and dry land can be adapted.

    Its advantages are that the growing period is short, only 65 days to mature. The yield is 250 to 300 jin per mu. The rice is yellow, sticky, and fragrant when cooked. The rice yield is 75%. It is resistant to diseases and insect pests and is relatively resistant to waterlogging.

    Sowing can be done in mid-May, or ten days later when there is a drought. Apply 4,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. It is better to apply topdressing. The amount of seeds sown per mu is 1.5 jin. Cover with one cun of soil and compact it once. After the seedlings are two cun high, thinning can be carried out, with a plant spacing of four to five cun, a row spacing of one to two chi, and three to four plants per clump, but not too many.

    During the growing period, pay attention to weeding in time, generally four times is appropriate, more cultivation is better, but pay attention to doing it in time.

    (3) Qi Yue Huang (July Yellow)
    "Qi Yue Huang" Millet is a farmer variety from Chahar and Suiyuan. Because it matures early, it is called "July Yellow." The adaptation area is the Yanbei area of ​​Chahar and the eastern area of ​​Suiyuan. It is mostly cultivated in Fengzhen, Liangcheng, Jining, and Gui Sui areas of Suiyuan Province.

    Traits: The seedlings are red-green. The stalk is three to four chi high. The stalks are soft and light red. The ear is slender and conical. The spikelets are dense and hairy. The rice grains are medium to large. The tillering ability is weak, with two to three plants per plant. The rice bran is light yellow. Its advantage is that it matures early, maturing in 70 days, and the yield is high, 20 jin more than ordinary early-maturing varieties. In normal years, each mu can harvest 250 to 300 jin. The rice yield is high, with 80 jin of millet can be produced from every 100 jin of millet.

    The cultivation method is the same as ordinary millet, that is, after plowing and harrowing the land, apply 3,000 to 4,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. Sowing can be done from May 4th to May 15th. In the Wanquan area of ​​Chahar Province, it is mostly sown in early June. The amount of seeds used per mu is 1.5 jin. The sowing depth is one cun, not too deep. Compact it once after sowing (twice in Suiyuan Province). When the seedlings are two cun high, thin them out, with a plant spacing of eight cun, a row spacing of one chi, and three plants per hill is enough, not too many. During the growth period, pay attention to weeding in time, with four cultivations being appropriate.

    (4) Liu Shi Ri Huan Jia (Xiao Ji Gu) (Sixty Days to Return Home (Small Urgent Millet))
    This millet is a variety suitable for stubble planting. In Wuyi area of ​​Hebei Province, it is called "Sixty Days to Return Home," and some call it "Xiao Ji Gu." In Shanghe area of ​​Weixian County, Shandong, it is called "Sixty Days to Return to Granary," which are all the same variety.

    Traits: The seedlings are light green. The stalk is three chi high and not easy to lodge. The ear is conical, the spikelets are dense, hairless, and seven or eight cun long. The rice grains are small and yellow. The tillering ability is weak.

    Its advantages are that in times of spring drought and lack of rain, it can be sown after wheat harvest, ensuring two crops a year, and allowing wheat and millet to be rotated, changing the cultivation system. Also, because it matures early (maturity period is 60 days), it can be harvested before pests (such as armyworms) occur, which can avoid pest disasters, ensuring "return home," so it is called "Sixty Days to Return Home."

    The average yield per mu can reach 250 to 300 jin. The rice grains are small, yellow in color, and of good quality. The rice yield is 75%, the rice bran is yellow, and the skin is thick and tough. Strong resistance to head smut.

    Sowing can be done in mid-to-late May. The amount of seeds per mu is 2 jin. Sowing should not be too deep, one cun is appropriate. Compact it once after sowing to ensure that the millet grains are tightly combined with the moist soil, which is convenient for germination and emergence. The plant spacing is seven cun, the row spacing is one chi, and three to four plants are left per hill. During the growth period, cultivate and weed four times, and pay attention to doing it in time.

    (5) Other Varieties
    1. "Xiao Bai Gu" (Small White Millet): Mostly cultivated in southeastern Shanxi. Each mu can harvest 300 jin and matures in 80 days. The rice is yellow and of good quality. Strong resistance to diseases and insect pests.

　　谷子早熟优良品种介绍
    刘士林
    谷子的早熟种比较分散复杂，根据各地栽培习惯，对于品种定名，多不一致，有按成熟期早晚定名为“六十日还家”和“七十天”的，有按性状的不同定名为“长脖子”和“小铁捧锤”的，有按产量定名为“发财红”和“三石准”的，有按种子的来源定名为“沁州谷”和“莱芜黄”的，还有按适应性定名为“抗旱谷”和“海里站”的，也有的因为品名虽同而性状不同，所以有加上“有毛”“没毛”的，有加上“青秸”，“红秸”的，还有加上“穗松”“穗紧”的以区别两品种的不同。根据调查，如按性状分类，约在百种左右，仅山东省即有三十多品种，这里只选其中的几个优良品种介绍一下。
    （一）边一谷
    “边一谷”就是“边区一号谷”是适合河北省西部地区栽培的早熟改良种，去年在河北省西部及察南地区即推广了一千三百多亩（其中河北省十一专区各农场推广了七百五十斤种子，定县专区推广了六千多斤种子”并在秋后选收了谷种四万七千多斤，今年可播种三千亩。它的由来是在一九四三年由前晋察冀边区第二农场从冀西农家早熟种中选育出来的。
    性状：秸杆黄白色，节间比较短，不很粗，高三尺到四尺，叶深绿色，窄长比较密，向上伸长，分叶力强，每株七至八个，穗形像鼠尾一样，小穗不很紧，穗色黄尖端稍尖有毛，米粒中大，色黄有光泽，米糠金黄色。
    它的好处是晚种早熟，适合麦后播种，一年可获两熟，生长期七十五天，（去年在易县一带调查，只须七十天就可成熟）产量大，平均每亩可收三百至三百五十斤。能抗钻心虫和白发病（看谷老），因为穗上有毛，也不怕风磨。出米率比较高，每百斤谷子可碾米七十五斤，米色黄好吃。
    边一谷的栽培：水旱地都行，播种前先把地整好，每亩地上肥四千斤。六月中下旬即可播种，今年地气湿润，应在六月十日前后下种。每亩地用种量一·五市斤，如果有蝼蛄为害的地方，每亩地可用种二市斤。播种不可过深，以一市寸深度为宜。下种后八至九天即可发芽出土，苗高二寸多，即进行间苗。边一谷发槎多，适合留单株，即每隔八寸留苗一株，瘠地可留二株，但不可多留，以免生长不良。
    栽种后须勤加管理，要紧的是锄草，中耕次数以四次为宜。收获前进行田间选种，分打分收，准备下来年种子。
    （二）小春谷
    “小春谷”是冀中一带农家习种的品种。因为成熟早，可以救急，所以栽培区域比较广，农家保存的种子，也很普遍。
    性状：幼苗时期根子带紫色。杆高三尺到四尺，穗细长约七八寸。米粒小，淡黄色，米糠黄色，皮较厚。分槎不多，每株二至三个。水浇地及旱地都能适应。
    它的好处是生长期短，只须六十五天就可成熟。产量每亩二百五十到三百市斤。米色黄，有粘性，做饭有香味。出米率百分之七十五。抗病虫力强，且比较抗涝。
    栽种时期五月中旬即可下种，天旱时晚十几天也可以。每亩地施肥四千斤，能施追肥更好。每亩播种量一·五市斤。覆土一寸，镇压一次。苗高二寸后，即可间苗，株距四至五寸，行距一·二尺，每丛三至四株，不可多留。
    生长期间，注意及时锄草，一般以四次为宜，多锄更好，但须注意及时。
    （三）七月黄
    “七月黄”谷是察绥农家品种。因成熟的早，所以叫“七月黄”。适应地区为察哈尔雁北地区及绥东地区，在绥远省丰镇、凉城、集宁及归绥一带多有栽培。
    性状：幼苗红绿色。杆高三尺到四尺。秸软淡红色。穗细似圆锥形。小穗紧密，有毛。米粒中大。分蘖力弱，每株二至三株。米糠淡黄色。它的好处是成熟早七十天即可成熟，产量大，比普通早熟种多收二十斤，平常年景每亩也可收二百五十到三百斤。出米率高，每百斤谷子可出八十斤小米。
    栽培方法和普通谷子一样，即整耙地后，每亩施肥三千到四千斤。五月四日，到五月十五日即可下种，察哈尔省万全一带则多在六月上旬播种。每亩用种量一·五市斤。播种深度一市寸，不可过深。播后镇压一次（绥远省镇压二次），苗高二寸许进行间苗，株距八寸，行距一尺，每墩留苗三株即可，不宜多留。生育期间注意及时锄草，以中耕四次为宜。
    （四）六十日还家（小急谷）
    这谷是适合麦茬播种的品种。河北省武邑一带叫“六十日还家”，也有叫“小急谷”的，在山东潍县商河一带叫“六十日还仓”，都是同一品种。
    性状：幼苗淡绿色。秆高三尺，不易倒伏。穗似圆锥形，小穗紧密，无毛，长七、八寸。米粒小，色黄。分蘖力弱。
    它的好处是在春旱缺雨时，可以在麦收后播种，保证一年两熟，又可使麦谷进行轮作，改变耕作制度。又因为它成熟早（成熟期六十天）在害虫（如粘虫）未发生前即可收获，可免虫灾，保证还家，所以叫“六十日还家”。
    每亩产量平均可打二百五十至三百市斤。米粒小，色黄，品质佳良，出米率百分之七十五，米糠黄色，皮厚坚韧。抗黑穗病能力强。
    栽培时期五月中下旬即可播种。每亩种量二市斤。播种不可过深，以一寸为宜。播种后镇压一次，使谷粒与湿土密合，便于发芽出土。株距七寸，行距一尺，每墩留苗三至四株。生育期间中耕锄草四次，须注意及时。
    （五）其他品种
    １、“小白谷”：山西东南部多有栽培。每亩可收三百市斤，八十天成熟。米色黄，品质佳良。抗病虫力均强。
    ２、“稷谷”：山东齐河一带多有栽培。早熟，六十五天就可成熟。出米率百分之七十五以上，米质好。适应性强，在白沙地也可生长。
    ３、“白晚谷”：山东历城一带多有栽培。成熟期七十五天，每亩平均可收二百五十市斤，出米率百分之七十。适于麦后播种。
    ４、“毛毛红谷”：也叫“牛毛红”，在察哈尔省宣化一带多有栽培，适于麦后播种。成熟早，六十天就可成熟。每亩平均产量二百五十斤，出米率百分之七十五。抗旱能力强。
    ５、“小快谷”：河北省束鹿一带多有栽培。六十五天成熟。产量大，每亩平均可收三百市斤，出米七成。抗旱力强。
    ６、“小黄谷”：河北省沙河一带多有栽培。适于麦茬播种。生长期六十天。每亩平均可收三百市斤，出米率百分之七十五。抗病虫力强，耐旱。
    ７、“小青谷”：河北易县一带多有栽培。成熟期七十天。每亩产量二百三十市斤，出米率百分之七十。抗旱力强，适于麦茬播种。
    ８、“三穷谷”：河北束鹿一带多有栽培。产量每亩地可收三百市斤，出米百分之七十。七十天可成熟。
    ９、“藁城谷”：保定附近多有栽培。生长期七十五天。每亩地可收二百八十市斤，米质好吃。抗病虫力均强，耐涝。
    此外察哈尔万全一带的“小红谷”，绥远的“小铁棒锤”，山东省泰安县的“七十天”谷，河北省定兴县的“钱串黄”谷等都是早熟种，也都是农家多年习种的良种，但究竟那一个品种是代表某一个地区的最优良的品种，还希望各地农场同志，注意搜集材料，加以试验研究，在两三年内选出比较适宜当地的早熟品种，改善耕作制度，减少病虫的为害，保证收成，增加农民的收益。
