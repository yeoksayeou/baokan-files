Landlord Delays Paying Hired Laborers' Wages
Zhang Qishun Writes to Urge People's Court to Act Swiftly

To the Editor:
	Last year, I worked hard for a year for the landlord Wang Lianyu of Dabaile Village, Nantou Shun Village, Nanyuan. When I finished work in the late eighth lunar month, after settlement, I was supposed to receive ten shi of corn as wages. But he deliberately refused to pay. At that time, the land reform work was just beginning, and I complained about my grievances to the work team and the peasant association. But not only did they ignore me, but they also said that I was deliberately causing trouble. Therefore, on March 18th, I again requested the Fourteenth District People's Government to resolve this issue. They gave him ten days to pay the wages in full, but ten days passed, and he still didn't give them to me. They repeatedly ordered him to pay, but still to no avail. In this way, the landlord saw that even the district people's government could not do anything to him, so he became even more tyrannical and refused to pay me my wages. So, I reported this matter to the Beijing People's Court. The court initially gave the landlord seven days to pay, but after seven days, he still didn't pay. Later, the court gave him five more days to give me two shi of corn first, but after five days, he still didn't give it to me. So, I went to the court to sue again. The court said that a judgment could be made in ten days or so, and asked the landlord to give me the money from selling the house. But ten days passed, and he still didn't give it to me. The court said that the judgment would be issued in seven days. But seven days have passed, and the wages are still nowhere to be seen. Today (May 13th), I went to the court to inquire, and the court said that the judgment would be issued in ten days or so. The court has repeatedly delayed like this, and I really don't know when this problem will be resolved. The People's Court serves the people, and I hope they can give me a clear answer as soon as possible.

　　地主拖欠雇工工资
　　张起顺来信促人民法院迅速处理编辑同志：
    去年我给南苑南头顺村大白楼地主王连玉作了一年苦工，阴历八月下旬歇工时，结算了一下，应得工资十石玉米。但他却故意不给。那时土地改革工作正开始，我便将我的委曲诉到工作组和农会。但他们非但不理，反说我有意捣乱。因此，三月十八日，我又请求十四区人民政府解决这个问题。他们限他十天交清工资，但十天过去，他仍不给我。他们又一次二次的限他交款，还是没有结果。这样，地主看到区人民政府也难为他不得，便越发强横而不给我工资了。于是，我便将这事告到北京市人民法院。法院起先限地主七天给清，但七天后，他又未给。以后法院又限了他五天先给我两石玉米，但五天后他仍不给我。这样，我又到法院控告，法院说十来天可以判决，叫地主将卖了房子的钱给我。但十天过去，他仍不给我。法院说，七天后判决书便可下来。但七天过去了，工资还未见踪影。今天（五月十三日）我到法院询问，法院又说十来天准可下判决书。法院如此一再耽延，我真不知这问题何时才有结果。人民法院是为人民服务的，希望他们能快点给我一个明白的答复。
