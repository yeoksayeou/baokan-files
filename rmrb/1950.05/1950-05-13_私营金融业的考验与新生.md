The Trials and Rebirth of Private Finance
　　Shu Yan

            One
    China's private financial industry was extremely weakened during the twelve years of inflation under the Kuomintang reactionary government, far from comparable to the pre-war period. However, it superficially maintained a false prosperity. On the one hand, it engaged in usurious lending, pursued excessive profits, and developed bloated and large organizations with extravagant and wasteful facades. On the other hand, it spawned small and medium-sized banks and firms with limited capital and poor credit, providing blood transfusions to speculators and sharing in speculative profits, becoming the central hub of speculative activities. Today, as the People's Government strives to balance fiscal revenues and expenditures, curb inflation, and normalize the national economy, private banks and firms, accustomed to close ties with speculative activities and unlimited credit expansion, have encountered serious difficulties. The vast majority of banks and firms face two paths: either to strengthen their capital, engage in joint operations, thoroughly reform their business operations, and reduce expenses to survive and develop; or to switch to other industries as early as possible and invest in production sectors beneficial to the national economy. Otherwise, they will inevitably follow the path of decline and closure.
            Two
    Currently, there have been a few instances of private banks and firms closing down, especially in Shanghai. In March, closures occurred continuously, reaching thirty-three. By mid-April, another thirteen had closed. In total, nearly one-third of private banks and firms have ceased operations since the beginning of this year.
    In addition, private banks and firms are experiencing serious losses and capital stagnation. Since the end of March, the number of bill exchanges in Shanghai has only accounted for one-ninth of the total deposits, reflecting the extreme decline of speculative transactions. Private bank deposits have increased, but interest rates are too high, and productive enterprises cannot accept loans. As a result, business is shrinking, and due to high expenses and extremely tight social credit, huge losses and bad debts have accumulated. Among the eighteen banks in Hankou, nine have current liabilities exceeding current assets. The largest imbalance between assets and liabilities in one bank reached 84%. By the end of March, most of the loans from banks and firms to productive enterprises could not be recovered for the time being, and some had been rolled over as many as ten times. As for general small banks and firms, the situation of losses and stagnation is even more precarious. According to a sample survey of fifteen money shops in Tianjin in late March, overdue receivables and bad debts accounted for 33% of total loans, and together with losses, they accounted for 35%.
    What problems does this phenomenon reveal about private banks and firms?
    (A) Weak capital – According to the analysis of the situation of banks and firms that have gone bankrupt in various places, they are generally small banks and firms that cannot make up for the shortfall in the clearing house and cannot pay off debts due. Generally speaking, they have weak capital, high speculation, and a very poor credit base. The total deposits of the forty-five banks and firms that went bankrupt in Shanghai before April were only 29 billion, accounting for only one-tenth of the total deposits of all banks and firms at that time, which is equivalent to the deposits of two larger banks. However, from the organizational point of view, they accounted for about one-third of the total number of banks and firms, and from the number of employees, they accounted for one-quarter of the total number of employees of all banks and firms. This is enough to show that the closure of these banks and firms is by no means accidental.
    (B) Credit expansion – Relying on inflation for the past ten years, many banks and firms that have experienced abnormal "prosperity" have blood ties with speculative capital, or at least indirectly support these excessive profiteers for their survival. In particular, many of the money shops' loans do not select their targets and expand credit without restriction. For example, when prices in Tianjin soared wildly last October, the average credit loans of money shops accounted for 80% of total deposits, and in some cases, even all of them; moreover, some banks and firms relied on large amounts of borrowing to make indiscriminate loans, and one bank's loans even reached 13 times its deposits during the same period. Once the turnover fails, they have no choice but to declare bankruptcy.
    (C) Excessive interest rates – High interest rates are the means for banks and firms to absorb deposits and the source of their income, but at present, they have become an important factor leading to the crisis. According to the survey, from mid-June of last year to the end of January of this year, prices in Shanghai rose by 17.4 times, while the compound interest rate for three days rose by 57 times, and the compound interest rate for seven days rose by 49.5 times. Such deposit interest cannot be borne by a legitimate bank or firm, and such loan interest cannot be borne by a legitimate industry or commerce. During the third price fluctuation in Shanghai last year, the interest rate index rose by 465% in just forty days, far exceeding the rate of price increase at that time. This fact further proves that blind high interest rates are an effective execution tool to strangle banks and firms and industry and commerce.
    (D) Large organization and heavy expenses – During the Anti-Japanese War, due to the temptation of illegal profiteering, banks and firms newly established by relying on bureaucratic capital and special backgrounds sprang up like mushrooms. After Japan's surrender, the number of banks and firms even exceeded that of before the war by one time. In the process of the Kuomintang's "currency reform" and two capital increases after liberation, many banks and firms expanded their organization and personnel by means of pulling shares and transferring them, resulting in bloated personnel and complicated factions. One commercial bank placed twenty-two deputy managers to cope with shareholder relations. In the same institution, from the chairman of the board, general manager, assistant manager, vice president, director to ordinary employees, each took advantage of their different investment backgrounds to squeeze each other out and compete to embezzle bank funds, regardless of the credit base of the bank. Moreover, many bank employees operated lending to each other, implementing internal clearing, forming a disguised underground money shop. Therefore, the capital and income of general banks and firms were consumed by the heavy expenses. From January to March of last year, the various expenses of the thirty-nine banks and firms in Hankou accounted for 62% of their total income, and the expenses of nine well-known banks averaged 150% of their income. According to a survey in Tianjin in January, the treatment of managers of private banks was as high as 626 real units, the wages of workers in a money shop were 645 catties of millet, and the average wages of general employees were much higher than the standards of staff members of the National Bank today. Such personnel expenses accounted for 70-80% of their total expenses. Such heavy expenses are naturally unsustainable in the current situation where the profit rate is becoming increasingly normalized.
            Three
    However, there are some new developments in this transformation.
    First, it can be seen from the changes in the business comparison of banks and firms that there is a concentration trend of deposits shifting from money shops to banks, and from small and medium-sized banks to large banks, and the National Bank and joint state-private banks control the vast majority of deposits. Although the total deposits of private banks and firms in major domestic cities have been steadily rising in the past month and a half. However, if we look at the growth and decline of deposits of private banks and firms in the four major cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, and Hankou since December of last year, we can clearly see the changes in the comparison between the two:
              Shanghai       Tianjin       Beijing
    Year   Month   Bank    Money Shop    Bank    Money Shop    Bank    Money Shop
1949   12   78.1    21.9    47.7    52.3    45.7    54.3
1950   1   78.2    21.8    43.2    56.8    47.0    53.0
         2   78.3    21.7    49.3    50.7    48.1    51.9
         3   88.0    12.0    49.3    50.7    54.3    45.7
              Hankou
    Year   Month   Bank    Money Shop
1949   12   58.1    41.9
1950   1   53.8    46.2
         2   56.9    43.1
         3   63.8    43.1

    The above shows that the proportion of bank deposits gradually outweighs that of money shops, and the situation in Shanghai is even more obvious. Although money shops still accounted for 1.4% more of the strength of banks and firms in Tianjin at the end of March, the situation reversed by mid-April, with banks accounting for 55.8% and money shops accounting for 44.2%.
    Secondly, New China, Ningbo Commercial, China General, and China Industrial Banks have assumed the task of jointly absorbing social funds, playing a highly active role in business, and have signed contact contracts with the National Bank. At the end of March, the total deposits of the four banks in Shanghai increased by 182% compared with the end of February, and its proportion in the total deposits of all banks and firms (excluding the National Bank) jumped from the initial 13% to the current 43%. In Tianjin, on April 15, the deposits of the above four banks accounted for 20.9% of the deposits of private banks, an increase of 1.46 times compared with the beginning of the year.
            Four
    In order to help solve the difficulties of private banks and firms, the People's Bank has taken the following measures:
    (A) Promote joint loan organizations to provide a stable outlet for the investment of bank funds and facilitate the recovery and development of production. The People's Bank often uses different methods to participate in or provide partial funds, or leads and organizes banks and firms to jointly lend. Various joint lending offices or joint syndicates have been organized in Shanghai, Tianjin, Beijing, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi and other regions, and this work is still continuing.
    (B) Hold inter-bank short-term fixed deposits with the nature of rediscounts. Under the principle of mutual benefit, on the one hand, appropriately take care of the interests of banks and firms, solve the outlet for some of their funds, so as not to make indiscriminate loans due to the stagnation of deposits; on the other hand, the National Bank can also take this opportunity to control a part of social credit and stabilize the social and economic order.
    (C) Adjust the interest rates of deposit reserve, exchange accounts, and current accounts flexibly according to specific circumstances, and handle temporary re-pledges with the reserve funds deposited by the same industry as the limit.
    (D) In order to supply the needs of industrial funds, bill discounts have been handled, which are discounted by private banks and firms, and used to ensure the safety of bank funds.
    (E) Extend the time to make up for exchange deficits and allow inter-bank lending.
    (F) Relax the restrictions on the ratio of bank guarantees or credit for industry and commerce, so that their funds can be actively and flexibly used.
    This series of work shows that the National Bank has adopted a positive support and guidance policy for financial management, and has rationally established a public-private relationship between the National Bank and private banks and firms that takes into account both public and private interests. The National Bank has taken care of the interests of the private financial industry in the process of its own development, which is precisely its leading role. Does this fact not powerfully deny the rumors that "the People's Bank is squeezing out private banks and firms"?
            Five
    The facts of the past one or two months have told banks and firms that it is not impossible to develop if the business is sound and the credit is good. It is certain that the long-term stability of prices will be the trend in the future, and there is no way to wait for the opportunity to eliminate the gaps for speculation. From now on, the operating methods of the inflationary era should be completely changed, the organization should be reorganized, an economic accounting system should be established, and expenses should be reduced through labor-capital consultation, so as to improve the business.
    If private banks and money industries can raise funds and enrich their strength, accept the leadership of the state-owned economy after the normalization of the credit system, and organize themselves into the overall strength of the social economy, they will certainly be able to seek recovery and development. That is to say, private banks and firms must understand the policies of the National Bank, and plan to share part of the tasks. The National Bank should follow the Common Program: "Guide social idle funds and commercial capital that is useless to the national economy into industry and other production undertakings." The instructions are to support its development. However, small and medium-sized banks and firms that only operate independently with meager capital will inevitably encounter many difficulties. Only on a voluntary basis can we concentrate our efforts and operate jointly. For example, organize syndicates to jointly lend, establish joint reserve banks, jointly maintain credit externally, and help and supervise each other internally. At present, this is a more reasonable operating method. As for some banks and firms that are weak in capital and unable to enrich themselves, and organizations that are unsound and unable to transform, they should find ways to switch to other industries as soon as possible.
    The interest rate of banks and firms should be reduced in earnest, and no longer compete to absorb deposits at high interest rates, increasing their own burden. After the expenses are reduced, the loan interest rate should be reduced so that legitimate industry and commerce can afford it, solving the stalemate in the stagnation of bank funds caused by legitimate industry and commerce not daring to ask for funds and speculative undertakings not daring to give them funds even if they want them.
    Both the business and capital parties of private banks and money businesses should adopt an agreement method to work hard to overcome difficulties, that is, both parties must seek effective solutions on the basis of self-reliance and mutual benefit between labor and capital. After labor-capital consultations, Shanghai Guohua Bank proposed specific measures to overcome difficulties together. The capital party remitted foreign funds three times to reach 750,000 Hong Kong dollars, which not only made up for the losses and bad debts, but also increased the turnover of operating funds. At the same time, the labor party also suggested new business guidelines to the capital party, and in order to be considerate of the difficulties of the capital party, they voluntarily reduced their treatment and improved labor discipline and work enthusiasm, and the situation improved.
    In short, if private banks and firms can enrich their capital, engage in joint operations, reduce deposit and loan interest rates, implement labor-capital agreements, obey the leadership of the National Bank, and earnestly support production undertakings, they have a future for development. If they still fantasize about the restoration of inflation, continue speculative activities, delay the reform of internal business, and indulge in usury; then, the end of failure is inevitable!

　　私营金融业的考验与新生
　　舒湮
            一
    中国的私营金融业，在国民党反动派政府十二年的通货膨胀过程中，实力已极度削弱，远非战前可比。但表面上却保持着虚假的繁荣，在通货膨胀中它一方面进行高利贷放，追逐超额利润，组织机构臃肿庞大，门面阔绰浪费奢靡；一方面又蔓生了一些资力小、信用差的中小行庄，给投机者输血，向投机利得分润，成为投机事业的中枢。今天，在人民政府力争财政收支平衡、制止通货膨胀、调整国民经济使之正常化的过程中，习惯于与投机事业密切连结、习惯于无限制扩张信用的私营行庄，遭遇了严重的困难。绝大多数行庄都面临着两条路：或是充实资力，联合经营，切实改革业务经营方式，简省开支，以图生存与发展；或是及早转业，投资于有利国民经济的生产部门；否则，将无法避免走上关门倒闭的没落的道路。
            二
    目前私营行庄已有少数停业现象，尤以上海为甚。三月份内倒风连绵不断，关门者竟达三十三家；四月份至中旬止，又减少了十三家。合计今年以来，停业的私营行庄将近它总数的三分之一。
    此外，私营行庄亏损和资金呆滞的现象，也很严重。三月底迄今，上海票据交换数字仅占存款总额的九分之一，反映了投机性的交易极度衰退。私营行庄存款是增加了，但利息太高，生产事业无法接受贷款。因此业务萎缩，并以开支浩大，社会信用极度紧缩，于是形成巨额的亏损与呆账，汉口十八家银行中，有九家流动资产不抵流动负债。内中资负不能平衡，差额最高的一家银行，竟达百分之八十四。三月底行庄生产事业放款中，绝大部分一时无法收回，甚至有连续转账达十次之多的。至于一般小行庄，亏损与呆滞的情形更为险恶。据天津三月下旬抽查十五家钱庄的结果，催收款额与呆账占全部放款的百分之三十三，连同亏损竟占百分之三十五。
    从这现象中说明了私营行庄存在着一些什么问题呢？
    （甲）资力薄弱——根据各地已倒闭行庄的情形分析，大体上是交换所差头寸不能补足和不能支付到期债务的小型行庄，一般说来都是资力薄弱，投机性大，信用基础很差的。上海在四月份以前倒闭的四十五家行庄，其存款总额才二百九十亿，仅合当时全部行庄存款的十分之一，亦即相当于两家规模较大银行的存款；可是从机构上看，却占行庄总数的三分之一左右，从职工人数看，占全部行庄职工人数的四分之一。这就足够说明这些行庄的倒闭停业绝不是偶然的。
    （乙）信用膨胀——以往十几年来依靠通货膨胀而畸形“繁荣”的行庄，内中不少和投机资本发生血缘关系，或至少是间接支持着这些过分利得者而赖以生存的。特别是钱庄的放款，很多不择对象，无限制地扩张信用。例如天津去年十月物价狂涨时期，钱庄的信用放款平均竟占存款总额的百分之八十，个别行庄甚至是全部；更有若干行庄靠大量借款滥作放款，有一家放款竟达其同时期存款的十三倍之多。一旦周转失灵便非宣告破产不可。
    （丙）利息过高——高利率是行庄吸收存款的手段，也是行庄收入的来源，然而在目前却成为导致危机的重要因素。据调查，自去年六月中旬至本年一月底，上海物价上升十七·四倍，而利率三天期复利上升五十七倍，七天期复利上升四十九·五倍。这样的存息不是正当的行庄所能背得起的，这样的放息也不是正当的工商业所能背得起的。上海去年第三次物价波动期间，短短四十天里，利率指数上涨了百分之四百六十五，远超过当时物价的上涨率。这一事实更证明了盲目的高利率乃是扼杀行庄和工商业的有效刑具。
    （丁）组织庞大、开支浩繁——抗战时由于非法暴利的诱惑，凭借官僚资本和特殊背景而新设的行庄一时如雨后春笋。日本投降后，行庄的数量竟超过战前一倍，在国民党实行“币改”和解放后两度增资过程中，许多行庄更以拉股和顶让的方式扩充了组织与人事，结果人员臃肿，派系复杂，有一家商业银行，为应付股东关系竟安插了二十二个副理。同一机构中，从董事长、总经理、协理、经副襄理、主任以至普通职员，各利用其不同的投资背景，互相倾轧，竞相套用行款，不顾行庄的信用基础。更有不少行庄职员，彼此经营拆放，实行内部轧账，形成变相的地下钱庄。因此，一般行庄的资本与收益都因开支的浩大而消蚀了。去年一——三月份汉口三十九家行庄的各项费用占其全部收益的百分之六十二，内中有九家著名银行的开支平均为其收益的百分之一五○。另据天津一月份调查，私营银行经理级的待遇高达六百二十六个折实单位，一家钱庄的工友工资是六百四十五斤小米，而一般职员的平均工资也都远高过今天国家银行工作人员的标准。这种人事费用竟占其全部开支的百分之七○——八○。这样浩大的开支在目前利润率日趋正常化的形势下自然是无法支持下去的。
            三
    然而，在这一转变中，却另有一些新的发展。
    首先，从行庄业务对比的变化上可看出存款由钱庄转向银行，和由中小型银行转向大银行的集中趋势，而内中国家银行和公私合营银行更掌握着绝大多数的存款额。最近一个半月以来，国内主要城市的私营行庄存款总额虽然都在稳步上升。但是如果拿自去年十二月份以来，沪、津、京、汉四大城市私营行庄存款消长情形来看，便可以明了两者间对比的变化：
              上             海 天             津 北         
    京年       月   银    行 钱    庄 银    行 钱    庄 银    行 钱    庄１９４９ １２ ７８．１ ２１．９ ４７．７ ５２．３ ４５．７ ５４．３１９５０ １   ７８．２ ２１．８ ４３．２ ５６．８ ４７．０ ５３．０
         ２   ７８．３ ２１．７ ４９．３ ５０．７ ４８．１ ５１．９
         ３   ８８．０ １２．０ ４９．３ ５０．７ ５４．３ ４５．７
              汉             口年       月   银    行 钱    庄１９４９ １２ ５８．１ ４１．９１９５０ １   ５３．８ ４６．２
         ２   ５６．９ ４３．１
         ３   ６３．８ ４３．１
    上面说明了银行存款额的比重逐渐压倒钱庄，而以上海的情形为更明显。天津在三月底行庄力量的对比虽然钱庄还多出百分之一·四，但到了四月中旬，情势却反转过来，变为银行占百分之五五·八，钱庄占百分之四四·二了。
    其次，新华、四明、通商、中国实业四行分担了协力吸收社会资金的存款任务，在业务上发挥了高度的积极性，并与国家银行订立了联系合同。三月底上海该四行存款总额和二月底比较，增加了百分之一八二，它在全部行庄（国行除外）存款总额的比重中，由初期的百分之十三跃为目前的百分之四十三。天津在四月十五日，上述四家银行存款已占私营银行存款的百分之二○·九，比年初增加一·四六倍。
            四
    人民银行为帮助解决私营行庄的困难，曾有下列的措施：
    （甲）推动联合贷款组织，使行庄资金的投放，获得稳妥出路，并有利于生产的恢复与发展。人民银行经常运用不同的方式或参加部分资金，共同贷放，或领导组织行庄，自行联放。在沪、津、京、杭、宁、镇、苏、锡和其他地区，都曾经组织各种联合放款处或联合银团，这件工作目前仍在继续推进中。
    （乙）举办再存款性质的同业短期定存，在两利的原则下，一方面适当的照顾行庄利益，解决其一部分资金的出路，使不致因存款壅滞而滥作放款；另一方面，国家银行也可以借此控制一部分社会信用，稳定社会经济秩序。
    （丙）对存款准备金、交换户、往来户的余额，视具体情况，机动的调整其利率，并以同业缴存的准备金为限额，办理临时转质押。
    （丁）为供应工业资金的需要，曾经办理票据贴现，由私营行庄贴现，并借以保障行庄资金的安全。
    （戊）延长补足交换缺额时间，并允许同业拆放。
    （己）放宽行庄对工商业押放或信放比率的限制，使其资金能主动的灵活运用。
    这一系列工作说明国家银行对于金融管理，已经采取了积极扶植与疏导政策，合理的建立了国家银行与私营行庄之间的公私兼顾关系。国家银行在自身发展的过程中，照顾了私营金融业的利益，这正是发挥了它的领导作用，这一事实不是有力地否定了“人民银行挤垮私营行庄”的谣诼吗？
            五
    最近一两个月来的事实告诉了行庄，凡是业务健全而信用好的，并非不可能发展。今后物价的长期稳定将是肯定的形势，投机取巧的隙缝杜绝，也无法再等待那个时会了。从现在起，通货膨胀时代的经营方式应该彻底改变，重新整顿机构，建立经济核算制度，通过劳资协商，减低开支，这样才能使业务好转过来。
    私营银钱业如果能够调集资金，充厚实力，在信用制度正常化之后，接受国营经济的领导，并把自己组织在社会经济整体的力量当中，一定能够求得恢复与发展。这就是说，私营行庄必须了解国家银行的政策，有计划的分负部分的任务，国家银行当依照共同纲领：“引导社会游资及无益国计民生的商业资本投入工业及其他生产事业”的指示，扶助其发展。但是中小型行庄如仅以微薄的资力单独经营，还不免要遭遇到许多困难。只有在自愿的基础上，集中力量，联合经营。例如组织银团联合贷放，建立联合准备库，对外共同维护信用，对内互相扶助监督。就目前讲，这是比较合理的经营方式。至于某些资力薄弱而又无法充实、组织不健全而又无力改造的行庄，应该及早设法转业。
    行庄的利率应该切实降低，不再竞以高利吸收存款，增加自己的负担。开支缩小之后，应当减低放款利率，使正当工商业负担得起，解决了正当工商业不敢要资金、而投机事业虽要资金又不敢给，所造成的行庄资金呆滞的僵局。
    私营银钱业务资双方应该采取协议方式努力克服困难，即一切困难双方都必须站在自力更生和劳资两利的基础上，寻求有效的解决途径，上海国华银行经过劳资协议，提出了共渡难关的具体办法，资方三次调回国外资金达港币七十五万元，不但弥补了亏损和呆帐，而且增加了营运资金的周转，同时劳方也向资方建议新的业务方针，并为体谅资方的困难，自动减低待遇，提高劳动纪律与工作情绪，局势就好转起来了。
    总之，私营行庄如果能够充实资力，联合经营，降低存放利率，实行劳资协议，服从国家银行领导，切实扶植生产事业，是有发展的前途的。如果还幻想通货膨胀的恢复，继续投机事业，迁延内部业务的改革，陶醉于高利贷；那末，失败的结局是无可幸免的！
