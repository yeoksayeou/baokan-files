　　Interview with Vice President Li Siguang
    Our Reporter Bai Sheng
    Progressive scientific workers are needed by the people and are loved by the people.
    Today, I am very pleased to meet Professor Li Siguang, the Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a world-renowned geologist, in the capital of the people. After some twists and turns, this old scholar, with his graying hair and sixty-two years of age, has finally returned to the embrace of the people's motherland amidst the expectations of many.
    Filled with excitement, he spoke freely with us. First, he humbly stated, "Regarding the recent situation of scientific work abroad, I am very sorry, I can only talk about Western Europe approximately, because I have not had the opportunity to go to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, nor have I been to the United States."
    Mr. Li went to London in 1948 to attend the 18th International Geological Congress; he only returned to the motherland this spring after many detours.
    In the conversation, he first introduced us to the people engaged in scientific work in various Western European countries. Generally speaking, there are three different situations, all of which directly or indirectly indicate the decline of capitalism in Western Europe and even the world. One type of person, although they feel that the world situation has changed greatly after the war, they still blindly do not change their attitude. Most of these people regard scientific work as one of many professions in capitalist society. Their belief—if they have one—is the old saying that "academics are above all else" and "science for science's sake," etc., thinking that their profession is the most noble. They sit in an ivory tower, thinking that by using a purely objective attitude to analyze everything, they can definitely get a correct understanding and discover absolute truth. They seem to believe that if the truth says the world should be destroyed, then let it be destroyed, it has nothing to do with them. Another type of person feels that whether from some central issues of science itself, or from the relationship between science and life, it has now reached a point where they cannot but change their attitude or method; but they are not very clear about how to change it. These people are wandering in the wrong direction, even embarking on a pessimistic path. They cannot help but doubt science itself. In the past, what they were proud of was "seeking happiness for mankind"; today, they are asked to study various weapons of mass destruction; not only destroying others, but also destroying themselves. In the past, some people talked about "freedom of science," but today, most people's work is controlled by military secrets. Not only is information isolated internationally, but even domestically, each small part is isolated. Even worse, thoughts must be censored, so what "academic dignity" and "freedom of thought" can be said? Such contradictions are now prominently placed in front of Western European scientists. Only another type of person sees that the root of these many evils is not in science itself, but the inevitable phenomenon of reactionary forces enslaving scientific workers. Those reactionaries know that they themselves are already dying, stop at nothing, collude with American imperialism, make a final struggle, and use all means to oppress these scientists who dare to speak and act. Upright scientists work earnestly on the one hand, and unequivocally point out the crimes of their government's collusion with American imperialism, publish many harsh criticisms in progressive publications, and point out the path of progress. Speaking of this, Mr. Li said with excitement: In such a chaotic and distressed situation, they can still do creative work, which makes us very admirable.
    Finally, talking about his feelings about returning to China, Mr. Li said happily and humbly: What he has seen is still very little, and what he understands is not enough; but what he feels most intimately is that the entire Chinese atmosphere is completely new. After returning to China, seeing the rapid transformation of thought and enthusiasm for learning among many friends in the scientific community, he felt very excited. Then, Mr. Li also put forward some opinions on the current scientific research in China. He said: In the past, Chinese scientific workers have been in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial situation, and inevitably left behind many old problems brought by imperialism, which can be seen from the point of view and method of research. For example, when discussing issues, they often overemphasize the opinions of a certain foreign professor, while ignoring the focus of the issue itself, which inevitably carries a bit of comprador flavor. Today, we must humbly accept the strengths of others on the one hand, and also rouse the spirit of independent work. Vanity and blind faith in authority are both obstacles to scientific work.
    From Mr. Li's words that burst from his heart, one can deeply feel that he is full of confidence in the development of science in today's New China. In the conversation, he expressed his excitement for the bright future of science in New China from time to time.

　　访李四光副院长
    本报记者　柏生
    进步的科学工作者，是为人民大众所需要的，也是为人民大众所爱戴的。
    今天记者很愉快地在人民的首都会见了一位中国以至全世界闻名的地质学家——中国科学院的副院长李四光教授。经过几许周折，这位白发班驳，年高六十二龄的老学者，终于在多少人的期望中，回到人民祖国的怀抱里来了。
    满怀着兴奋，他和我们畅谈起来。首先他谦虚地声明说：“关于国外最近科学工作的情况，我很抱歉，只能就西欧方面约略地谈谈，这因为我没有机会到东欧和苏联，也没有去到美国”。
    李先生是一九四八年赴伦敦出席国际地质学会第十八届年会的；今春才辗转回到祖国。
    在谈话中，他先为我们介绍了西欧各国目前从事科学工作的人们。就一般的趋势说，有三种不同的情形，直接间接都表示着西欧以至全世界资本主义衰落的现象。一种人虽然感觉到大战以后世界情况已经大变，但是他们仍然迷迷糊糊地不改变他们的态度。这些人多半把科学工作当作资本主义社会中许多职业的一种，他们的信仰——如果有信仰的话——是“学术高于一切”、“为科学而科学”等等一套旧话，以为他们的职业是最清高的。他们坐在象牙之塔里，以为用纯粹客观的态度来分析一切，一定可以得到正确的了解，发现绝对的真理。他们仿佛相信：如果真理说世界该毁灭，那也就让它毁灭罢了，与他们无关。另一种人感觉到无论从某一些科学的中心问题本身说，或者从科学和人生的关系说，现在已经走到不能不改变态度或者方法的境地；但是究竟应该怎样改法，却还不大明了。这些人正在彷徨歧途，甚至走上悲观的道路。对科学本身，都不免怀疑起来了。在过去他们所引以自豪的是“为人类谋幸福”；今天却要他们研究各种大量毁灭人类的武器；不独毁灭别人，也不免毁灭自己。过去还有人讲“科学自由”，今天大部分人的工作，因为受了军事秘密的控制，不独在国际间消息隔绝，在国内也是各个小部分各被隔离。更糟的是：思想都要受检查，还有什么“学术尊严”、“思想自由”可说？这样的矛盾，今天都显著地摆在西欧科学家的面前。唯有另一种人看破这许多罪恶的根源，不在科学本身，而是反动势力奴役科学工作者的必然现象。那些反动派知道他们本身已经垂危，不顾一切，勾结美帝国主义，作最后的挣扎，用尽一切方法来压迫这些敢说敢为的科学家。正直的科学家们一面认真工作，一面毫不隐讳地指出他们政府和美帝勾结的罪恶，在进步刊物上发表许多严厉的批评，并指出进步的途径。说到这里，李先生感奋地说：在这样混乱、苦闷的情况之下，他们还能作创造性的工作，这是使我们十分感佩的。
    最后谈到归国的感想，李先生愉快而谦虚地表示：看到的还很少，了解的也不够多；不过使他亲切地感到的就是整个中国气象的焕然一新。归国后看到许多科学界的朋友们思想转变的迅速和学习的热情，使他感到非常兴奋。接着李先生并对目前中国科学研究方面提出了一点意见。他说：过去中国科学工作者因为一直处在半封建半殖民地的情势下，不免遗留着许多帝国主义带来的旧毛病，这从研究的观点和方法上可以看出。例如在讨论问题的时候，往往过于着重某某外国教授的意见，而忽略了问题本身的重点，这未免带着几分买办的意味。今天我们一面要虚心接受人家的长处，一面也要抖擞独立工作的精神。虚骄和迷信权威，一样的是科学工作的障碍。
    从李先生那些迸发自内心的话语中，可以深切地感觉到他对今天新中国科学的发展是满怀着信心的。在谈话中，他不时地为新中国科学的光明远景表示兴奋。
