　　Oppose Irresponsible Publishers
　　Review of the "Times Encyclopedia Series"
　　Jin Canran
　　Since the liberation of Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai, some bookstores, catering to the general readers' growing need for books on revolutionary theory, construction experience, and historical knowledge, have published some pamphlets of very low quality and with many political and ideological errors. The authors and publishers of these pamphlets are extremely lacking in a sense of responsibility to the people and do not have the serious attitude that revolutionary cultural workers should possess. Therefore, they have no way to avoid falling into the ranks of speculators. Several books published by the Shanghai Times Bookstore (not Times Publishing House) can serve as representatives of this bad trend in the publishing industry. Below, I will use the "Times Encyclopedia Series" published by the Times Bookstore as material to briefly discuss the ideological and historical aspects, and attach a collation note. I hope my opinions can attract the attention of the Times Bookstore and individual bookstores with more or less similar situations, so that everyone cherishes their reputation and improves their sense of responsibility for publishing work.

　　　　　　One: Absurd Ideas

　　The ideological content of some of the pamphlets contained in the "Times Encyclopedia Series" is quite inconsistent, but they have a common characteristic: under the guise of some revolutionary phrases, they are filled with various incorrect and even reactionary ideas. Now, let's take "Anatomy of Society" (written by Liao Jue) and "How to Learn History" (written by Liao Jue) as examples.

　　"Anatomy of Society" is written in the form of letters. The author sets the time of communication around the liberation period, and the book was published in December 1949. One party in the communication is a student, and the other party is the student's ideological guide, who is the author. The book first discusses philosophy. The author believes that "the purpose of philosophy is to seek the first fundamental principle of the universe" (page 4), "the task of philosophy is to explain things that scientists think are unnecessary to explain" (page 5), and the work of philosophy is "so-called extremely deep research" (page 6). Behind these extremely idealistic and mystical arguments, the author also talks about the issue of standpoint: "Because human beings have selfish characteristics, all discussions and plans are based on their own interests. At the same time, the human body is a material form with a fixed limit, so it also has a certain standpoint, viewpoint, and vision." The author is so ignorant as to distort the issue of human standpoint, which is determined by social relations of production, as being determined by human character and physical form. Starting from this point of view, he further regards the standpoint as prejudice, and the struggle of the oppressed against the oppressors as a "smart" behavior of "majorityism" based on "mechanical concepts," and the struggle of the rulers against the oppressed as "using various balancing means from many mechanical formulas to seek buffer" (page 14). This is a malicious distortion of the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution. The class and national liberation struggles led by the proletariat on a global scale are the inevitable result of social development. This struggle will surely win victory, and any balancing, buffering, and suppression measures of the reactionary rulers cannot save them from their impending and inevitable doom.

　　Regarding Chinese society, the author certainly said some seemingly correct nonsense: "What controls China is capitalist imperialism," "Generally, they are under the control of imperialist economy and the influence of capitalist culture, but the remaining forces of feudalism and the hibernation of old consciousness cannot be ignored" (page 77); but his understanding is not actually like this. He is very sympathetic to a capitalist who believes that "really our country is too poor, we can't fight anymore, soldiers and soldiers have to fight, poor people and rich people have to fight, it's really terrible to go on like this" (page 45). He regards the factory opened by this capitalist in a certain place "as a typical example," believing that this factory "shows the posture of budding capitalism, and is a new and thriving atmosphere for all aspects, showing a turning point," "moving towards a new capitalist society," "land management first turns from enlightened figures who own a lot of land to industrial production," and then closes his eyes and says nonsense: "Generally speaking, the entire Chinese economic situation is also running at such a historical stage" (pages 63-64). From this, it can be seen that the author believes that under the control of imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital, national capital can develop smoothly. Therefore, he advises the student to "strive for the position and opportunity to be cultivated" and not to be "used by others," and "must not be infected with any political depression" (pages 62-63). He also laments with great concern: "Once the chain of China's march towards capitalism is broken, that is to say, the collapse of China's ruling power, this chaotic picture is not easy to depict" (page 72). After the student who communicated with the author left school, he was first appreciated by the capitalist, then served in a investigation agency in Nanjing related to the police station, and finally, according to the author's arrangement, ran to the liberated area to be sent out as an underground worker. From here, it is not difficult to see what kind of society the author is affirming under many lies, and what kind of character he is teaching.

　　"How to Learn History" is also a book full of ideological errors. In order to decorate the progressive appearance, the book also quoted some of Leontiev's words about the history of social development, saying, "Then, we have learned a new and correct view of history." I don't know whether this conclusion violated the author's wishes, or whether the typesetting room made a mistake, the "correct" word "正" in the book actually became the word "不" (not). This is a small problem, let's not worry about it. Let's take a look at how the author explains history. On the title page, the following sentence is arranged in four-point imitation Song typeface: "History is the deed of rights and interests of people inheriting cultural heritage," and in the main text it says: "So-called history is stories." "What is history? History is things of the past and present." This is a completely vulgar bourgeois view of history. In Marx's classic words: "The history of all societies that have existed up to now is the history of class struggle." The author simply does not understand this principle, and probably does not want to understand it. Regarding the view of history, the author sometimes explains it as historical prejudice and denies it completely (page 56); sometimes he adopts a sophistical tone, saying that "change is an immutable theorem, and what is immutable is the law of change" (page 62); sometimes he juxtaposes idealistic, mechanical, and materialistic views of history, and distorts the materialistic view of history as "originating from Saint-Simon's concept of production as the center" (page 70). For Chinese history, it is very wrongly interpreted as being controlled by geographical environment (page 51). Furthermore, class struggle is juxtaposed with gangs and guilds, saying that it is caused by "different interests between people," and the so-called different interests here are distorted by the author as the opposition between workers and peasants: "When grain prices are cheap, it is not cost-effective for farmers, and when rice prices are expensive, it is not cost-effective for workers. Indeed, there are those who take advantage, and there are those who suffer losses; there are those who suffer losses, and there are those who take advantage" (page 53). The author even lacks any national concept and national consciousness, saying that the Opium War was a struggle between civilization and backwardness between Britain and China (page 54). Moreover, lacking any people's feelings, he said: "For example, if a ceremony commemorating the Tiananmen Incident is held in Beijing and Shanghai at the same time, the emotions in Shanghai must not be as strong as the emotions expressed in Beijing"; "If a gathering about Chiang Kai-shek is held now, no matter whether its content meaning belongs to destruction or praise, the general reaction must be emotional expression" (page 80). Wantonly calling the founding ceremony with unprecedented great historical significance the "Tiananmen Incident," and for the public enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, in the author's writing, even to the point where destruction and praise are indistinguishable, where exactly does the author's standpoint lie!

　　　　　　Two: Erroneous History

　　Among the "Times Encyclopedia Series," a total of six volumes on modern Chinese history have been published. In order to save space, I will only briefly criticize "The Opium War" (written by Liu Daxin) and "The Boxer Rebellion" (written by Ming Qing) here according to the historical order, and collate "The Xinhai Revolution" (written by Gao Shaoxian) in the next section.

　　The author of "The Opium War" lacks basic historical and general knowledge, such as saying that opium is a biennial herb, that Indians treat guests with opium like persimmon cakes, that "ginseng trade cultivated the power of the Manchu Qing Dynasty and paved the way for the Qing army to enter the customs," etc., which is simply childishly ridiculous. He also lacks the basic ability to analyze problems, such as after listing the results of a survey of one thousand smokers addicted to smoking by the Nationalist government, discarding all social conditions and class relations, and concluding that the reasons for smoking addiction "are nothing more than disease and playing." In the use of materials, it is even more casual and opportunistic, such as using a page to introduce the Chinese and foreign writing methods of opium, using two pages to introduce various types of opium soil, and using a page to introduce smoking equipment, etc. (all seen in the first chapter).

　　Regarding the Opium War, an event of historical significance, the author's understanding is simply full of errors. He believes that "Britain is the most advanced country in the industrial revolution," "has always developed along the line of conquering agricultural nations," and Britain "certainly fought for the free trade of this special commodity opium, also because there were really no other commodities that could be shipped to the Chinese market in large quantities to sell well" (see the second chapter). That is to say, it is forgivable for Britain, this "advanced country," to conquer China, this backward country, with opium. According to the author's analysis, regarding the issue of opium prohibition, three types of people showed three different attitudes, namely the strict prohibition faction represented by Lin Zexu, that is, the scholar faction, the accommodation faction represented by Xu Naiji, that is, the bureaucratic faction, and the aristocratic faction represented by Mu Zhang'a. The author's evaluation of the scholar faction is that "the scholar faction is the most capable of grasping public opinion, and the pressure of public opinion at that time was really not to be underestimated, and Xu Naiji was completely overwhelmed by public opinion." The author's evaluation of the so-called bureaucratic faction is that "his views were finally proven by facts, fighting with Britain for the sake of prohibiting opium not only resulted in defeat, but after the war, the opium market was even more expanded and prosperous, and the cultivation of domestic tobacco also flourished, with both foreign opium and domestic tobacco prevailing at the same time" (all seen in the third chapter). How did our country lose in the Opium War? The author answers on page 26 that we "suffered a major defeat, mainly because our science and technology were backward and our weapons were broken." From this, it can be seen that in the author's view, opium should not have been banned, the war should not have been fought, and those who advocated banning opium and those who advocated fighting should be responsible for the defeat. The reason why we were defeated was not due to the corruption of the Manchu Qing Dynasty and the crimes of the traitors led by Qishan, but due to the backwardness of technology. This view is not new. The current Chiang bandit's fake representative in the United Nations, Jiang Tingfu, had already used it fifteen years ago to defend Chiang Kai-shek's traitorous behavior.

　　The author's national standpoint is very suspicious. In the fifth chapter, after listing some of Marx and Engels' correct remarks about the Opium War, he uncritically quoted the speeches of the reactionary British Prime Minister Palmerston and Army Minister Lassalle, who clamored for launching an aggressive war at the time, and also quoted the articles of the historian Mcgaete and The Times, spokesmen for the aggressive war, who insulted the Chinese people. In the sixth chapter, it is even asserted that "the decline of China's position... the world situation created by the industrial revolution is also an irresistible force." In the discussion questions listed at the end, readers are even asked to discuss such so-called central issues that lack any national consciousness: "Who fired the first shot," "Comparison of combat power and combat consciousness," "How is the propaganda of the two sides in the war, and the comparison of the content they promote." (Note: This article does not record China's combat power and the people's fighting will, nor does it describe the propaganda situation on the Chinese side.)

　　Regarding the Boxer Rebellion, the author's writing attitude is very worthy of study. He called the White Lotus Rebellion during the Qianlong period "plotting to start an army," and the suppression of the rebellion by the Manchu Qing Dynasty "pacification." The Boxer Rebellion's resistance is called "rebellion," "causing trouble," and "truly sad and foolish." The fact that the Boxer Rebellion was manipulated by Yuxian due to political naivety is called "putting them on the right track." Regarding the history of the movement, the author actually omitted the heroic struggle of the Chinese people against imperialist aggression, and instead exaggerated the backward superstitious aspects, calling the Boxer Rebellion "not an organic fighting force" and the Red Lantern Society "quite revealing psychological behavior," thus ridiculing: "What a foolish and sad national destiny!" On the other hand, for the invaders, a special chapter is devoted to "A Brief Account of the Entry of the Eight-Nation Alliance into Beijing," which very detachedly records how a group of invaders "attacked Beijing," "broke Tongzhou on July 17, and marched towards Beijing again on the 18th," and especially explained that "the Allied forces set up civil affairs halls in Beijing to manage civil affairs," and the "civil affairs" the author said here turned out to be "searching and killing Boxers, and corpses piled up like mountains." The chapter immediately following the special record of the invaders' "Entry into Beijing" is "The Emperor's Flight in Distress." In this chapter, the butcher traitor Cixi's obscene and shameless clothing and food are recorded, where "the supply was rough" on the escape route, where "the supply was slightly better," who "offered poached eggs," and who "offered wild yellow flowers," and the author praised this public enemy of the Chinese people as "how open-minded!" Even such boring things are recorded: "The eldest prince raised a puppy and asked the emperor for it, and later the eldest prince asked the eunuch to ask for it back, for which the eldest prince was punished." Readers should not misunderstand that the author is writing a secret history of the Qing Palace, because in the final "conclusion," he brought the issue back again and quoted the words of Waldersee, the head of the invading army, "as a summary of this article." Waldersee clamored: "Regarding the partition of China, which has been discussed frequently in recent years, judging from the country's current weakness in military equipment, exhaustion of finance, and chaos in the political situation, it is a once-in-a-millennium opportunity to implement the partition." All readers with a certain political level, please read this statement carefully.

　　　　　　Three: Collation Notes

　　Among the various pamphlets collected in this series, there are also those with few content errors and relatively high writing standards, and "The Xinhai Revolution" is one of them. What is the reason? Please see the following table (in order to be clear, the number of lines is omitted):

　　History of the Chinese National Liberation Movement (written by Hua Gang) 　　 The Xinhai Revolution (written by Gao Shaoxian) 　　 Comparison
　　Page 159 　　 Pages 2-3 　　 Completely the same description,
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 slight changes in wording
　　Page 167 　　 Pages 14-15 　　 Completely the same, paragraphing
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 slightly different
　　Page 168 　　 Pages 15-16 　　 Same content, wording
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 slightly changed
　　Page 166 　　 Pages 19-21 　　 Slightly changed wording
　　Page 168-170 　　 Pages 23-28 　　 Slightly different text paragraphs

　　Page 176-179 　　 Pages 58-69 　　 Same as above
　　Page 180-181 　　 Pages 74-76 　　 Same as above

　　The "History of the Chinese National Liberation Movement" I am based on is the first edition of the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore in August 1949, and the publication date of this "Xinhai Revolution" is January 1950. It should be stated that my collation is very rough, and I am afraid that there are still many omissions. Moreover, this pamphlet does not seem to be copied from one original copy. For example, pages 6 to 11 are all copied from pages 52 to 56 of the "History of the Chinese Modern Revolutionary Movement" published in Yan'an and now discontinued; pages 82 to 86 and pages 90 to 91 are copied from pages 120 to 122 and page 123 of Mr. Song Yunbin's "History of China in the Last Hundred Years."

### 反对对人民不负责任的出版者　评《时代百科小丛书》

　　反对对人民不负责任的出版者
　　评《时代百科小丛书》
　　金灿然
    京津沪解放以后，有个别书店，迎合一般读者日益增长的对革命理论、建设经验及历史知识的书籍的需要，出版了一些水准很低，政治思想错误很多的小册子。这些小册子的作者和出版者十分缺乏对人民负责的精神，丝毫没有革命的文化工作者应有的严肃态度，因而他们没有办法不堕落到投机商人的行列里。上海时代书局（不是时代出版社）出版的若干书籍，可以作出版界这种恶劣风气的代表。以下就把我所看到的时代书局出版的《时代百科小丛书》作材料，就思想、历史两方面略加论述，并附上一个校勘记。希望我的意见能够引起时代书局及与时代书局或多或少有类似情况的个别书店的注意，从而大家珍惜自己的名誉，提高对出版工作的责任心。
            一  荒谬的思想
    《时代百科小丛书》所包含的一些小册子，思想内容是颇不一致的，但有一个共通的特点，就是：在一些革命词句的掩饰之下，填塞着各色各样不正确的甚至反动的思想。现在以《社会的解剖》（廖觉著）《怎样学习历史》（廖觉著）为例。
    《社会的解剖》是用书信体写的，作者把通讯的时间定在解放前后，这本书出版的时期是一九四九年十二月。通讯的一方是一个学生，另一方是那个学生的思想指导人，就是作者。书中首先谈到哲学。作者认为“哲学的目的，是在于寻求宇宙第一根本原理”（页四），“哲学的任务在于解释科学家认为不必解释的事物”（页五），哲学的工作是“所谓极深研几”（页六）。在这些极端唯心论、神秘论的后面，作者也谈到立场问题：“因为人类有着自私的性格，一切议论和打算，都是要根据自身的利益出发的。同时，人体就是一具有定限的物质形体，所以也有着一定的立场、观点和视野。”作者竟无知到这个地步，把由社会生产关系所决定的人的立场问题，曲解作是由人类的性格与形体所决定的。由这个观点出发，他进而把立场当作偏见，把被压迫者对压迫者的斗争认为由“力学观念”出发的“多数主义”的“聪明的”行为，把统治者对被压迫者的斗争认为“从许多力学公式中运用出各种平衡手段，以谋缓冲”（页一四）。这是对于革命与反革命的斗争的恶意的歪曲。以无产阶级为领导的在全世界范围内所进行的阶级的与民族的解放斗争，是社会发展的必然结果。这个斗争必将获得胜利，反动统治者的任何平衡、缓冲、镇压手段都不能挽救他们的行将到来的不可避免的灭亡的命运。
    对于中国社会，作者固然也说了一些这样的似是而非的空话：“控制中国的都是资本帝国主义”，“一般都在帝国主义经济的控制和资本主义文化的影响之下，但封建残余的势力和旧意识的蛰伏，却也不能忽视”（页七七）；但他的认识其实并非如此。他对于这样一个资本家很表同情，这个资本家认为“实在我们这个国家太穷了，再也斗争不得，兵和兵要打仗，穷人和富人要斗争，这样下去真是不得了”（页四五）。他把这个资本家在某地所开的工厂“看作是一个典型”，认为这个工厂“表现着资本主义茁生的姿态，对于各方面，都是新生的欣欣向荣的气象，表现着一种转化的契机”，“向着新的资本主义社会开步走了”，“土地经营首先从拥有大量土地的开明人物中转向工业生产”，并进而闭着眼睛胡说道：“一般说来，整个中国经济情形，也跑在如此的历史阶段”（页六三至六四）。由此可见作者认为在帝国主义、封建势力、官僚资本控制之下，民族资本是可以畅快发展的，因此他劝那位学生“要争取被栽培的地位与机会”，不要“被人利用”，“且不可传染什么政治苦闷”（页六二至六三）。他又十分耽忧的悲鸣道：“中国走向资本主义的链子一断，就是说中国的统治权崩溃，这一幅散乱的图画是不容易描摹的”（页七二）。与作者通讯的那个学生走出学校以后首先被那位资本家所赏识，后来又在南京的一个与警察局有关的调查机关服务，最后，照作者的安排，又跑到解放区来作为一个地下工作者被派了出去。从这里不难看出，在许多谎言下，作者在肯定着一个怎么样的社会，教导着一种怎么样的人物。
    《怎样学习历史》也是一本在思想上谬误百出的书。为了装点进步面貌，书中也引了一些列昂节夫讲社会发展史的话，说，“那末，我们更又多懂得了一种崭新的正确的历史观了。”不知是这个断语违反了作者的心愿，还是排字房排错了，“正确”的“正”字在书中竟成了“不”字。这是小问题，且不去管它。我们来看一看作者怎样解释历史吧。在扉页上，用四号长仿宋字排了这样一句话：“历史是人们继承文化遗产的权益书”，在正文中又说：“所谓历史，就是故事。”“历史是什么呢？历史是古往今来的事情。”这完全是庸俗的资产阶级的历史观点。用马克思的经典的话来说：“一切至今存在过的社会的历史，是阶级斗争的历史。”这道理作者根本就不理解，恐怕他也不愿意理解。对于历史观，作者有的地方解释为历史的成见，根本加以否定（页五六）；有的地方又采取了诡辩的口吻，说“变是不可变的定理，不变的就是那变的法则”（页六二）；有的地方则将唯心的、机械的与唯物的历史观点并列，并且把唯物史观曲解为“是导源于圣西门的以生产事业为中心的观念”（页七○）。对于中国历史，十分错误的解释为受地理环境所左右（页五一）。更把阶级斗争与帮口、行会并列，说是由于“人与人间的利益不同”而引起的，而这里的所谓利益不同，作者竟曲解为工农对立：“谷价贱了，农民不合算，米价贵了，工人划不来。的确，有占便宜的，就有吃亏的；有吃亏的，就有占便宜的”（页五三）。作者甚至于毫无国家观念与民族意识，说鸦片战争是英国与中国间的文明与落后的斗争（页五四）。而且缺乏任何人民的感情，说：“譬如在北京和上海同时举行纪念天安门事件的仪式，在上海方面的情绪，一定及不来北京所表现的情绪”；“假使现在举行一次关于蒋介石的集会，不论其内容意义是属于毁或誉，一般的反应，必然是有情绪表现的”（页八○）。把有空前伟大的历史意义的开国大典妄称为“天安门事件”，对于人民公敌蒋介石，在作者笔下竟至于毁誉不分，作者的立场究竟何在！
            二  错误的历史
    《时代百科小丛书》中，共出了六册关于中国近代史的。为了节省篇幅，我这儿只按照历史的顺序将《鸦片战争》（刘大新著）《义和团》（铭青著）略加批判，并在下一节中将《辛亥革命》（高韶先著）加以校勘。
    《鸦片战争》的作者缺乏起码的历史及一般常识，如说鸦片是二年生草本呀，印度人把鸦片像柿饼一样待客呀，“人参贸易培养起满清的势力，并且铺开了清兵入关的道路”呀等等，简直幼稚得可笑。他又缺乏起码的分析问题的能力，如在列举了国民党政府所作的一千个烟民成瘾的情况调查之后，抛开一切社会条件与阶级关系，断定吸烟成瘾的原因“不外乎疾病和玩弄两种”。在使用材料上，更是随随便便，顺手牵羊，如用了一页的篇幅介绍鸦片的中外写法，用了两页的篇幅介绍了各色烟土，又用了一页的篇幅介绍烟具等等（均见第一章）。
    对于鸦片战争这个有历史意义的事件的本身，作者的认识简直是错误百出。他认为“英国是一个产业革命的最先进的国家”，“一直是沿着征服农业诸民族的路线发展的”，英国“所以一定争着鸦片这一特殊商品的贸易自由，也实在因为没有别的商品可能大量运到中国市场来畅销”（见第二章）。这就是说，英国这个“先进国家”用鸦片来征服中国这个落后的国家，是情有可原的。据作者的分析，关于禁烟问题，三种人表现着三种不同的态度，即以林则徐为代表的严禁派即书生派，以许乃济为代表的变通派即官僚派，以穆彰阿为代表的贵族派。作者对于书生派的评价是“书生派是最能把握舆论的，当时舆论的压力实在不容轻侮，许乃济就完全被舆论所压倒的。”对于所谓官僚派，作者的评价是“他的见解终于有事实为之证明，为着要禁烟而和英国打仗，不仅打败了，打过仗之后，鸦片市场竟是更加扩大和繁荣，土烟的种植也兴盛起来了，洋烟土烟同时盛行”（均见第三章）。鸦片战争中我国怎样打败的呢？作者在页二六上解答说，我们“竟大吃败仗，主要是由于我们的科学和技术落后，武器窳败。”由此可见，在作者看来，鸦片是不应该禁的，仗是不应该打的，主张禁烟的、主张打仗的都应该负战败的责任，我们之所以打败，并不是由于满清的腐败及以琦善为首的卖国贼的罪过，而是由于技术的落后。这个见解并不新奇，现任蒋匪在联合国的伪代表蒋廷黻在十五年前已拿来替蒋介石的卖国行为作辩护了。
    作者的民族立场是很叫人怀疑的。他在第五章中开列了一些马克思及恩格斯的对于鸦片战争的正确言论之后，竟无批判的引用了当时的反动的英国首相帕马斯顿及陆军大臣拉沙尔等叫嚣进行侵略战争的演说，还引用了侵略战争的代言人历史学家麦加忒及泰晤士报的侮辱中国人民的文章。在第六章中，更断定“中国地位之降落，……产业革命所造成的世界情势，也实在是种不可抗拒的力量。”而在最后开列的讨论题中，也竟让读者讨论这样的毫无民族意识的所谓中心问题：“谁先开火”，“战斗力与战斗意识的比较”，“作战双方的宣传如何，暨其所宣传内容之比较”。（注：本文中并没有记述中国的战斗力及人民的战斗意志，也没有叙述中国方面的宣传情形。）
    关于义和团运动，作者的写作态度是很值得研究的。他把乾隆年间的白莲教起义称作“阴谋起兵”，把满清对于起义的镇压叫作“戡平”。对于义和团的反抗，称为“变乱”、“肇祸”、“真堪悲痛的愚蠢”，对于义和团因政治上的幼稚而受了毓贤的玩弄，称作“把他们纳入正轨”。对于运动的历史，作者竟将足以表现中国人民的反对帝国主义侵略的英勇斗争行为略而不提，反倒过分夸张的记述了落后的迷信的方面，称义和团“不是一种有机体的战斗力”，红灯罩是“相当暴露性心理行为的”，从而嘲弄道：“多么愚蠢而可悲的民族命运！”另一方面，对于侵略者，却专辟一章叫作“八国联军进京简记”，很超然的记载了一群侵略者如何“向北京进攻”，“七月十七日破通州，十八日再向北京进军”，并且特别交代“联军在北京城内分区设置民政厅管理民事”，这儿作者所说的“民事”，原来就是“搜杀义和团，尸如山积。”在专记侵略者《进京》的一章后面，紧接着的一章就是《皇帝逃难》。在这一章中，记载了屠夫卖国贼荒淫无耻的慈禧穿什么衣服，吃什么饭，在逃跑的路上，哪儿“供张草率”，哪儿“供张稍好”，谁“进荷包鸡蛋”，谁“进野黄花”，并且盛赞这个中国人民的公敌“多么豁达啊！”甚至将这样无聊的事也记上了：“大阿哥养了一条小狗，给皇上要了去，后来大阿哥又找太监去讨回，为这事大阿哥受了责罚。”读者切不要误会作者在写清宫秘史，因为他在最后的“结论”中，又把问题拉了回来，并且引用了侵略军队的首脑瓦德西的话“作为本文的总结”。瓦德西叫嚣道：“关于近年以来时常讨论之瓜分中国一事，若以该国现刻武备之虚弱，财政之衰竭，政象之纷乱而论，实为千载难得之实行瓜分时机。”一切有一定政治水平的读者，请三复斯言。
            三  校勘记
    这套丛书中所收集的各种小册子，也有内容错误不多，写作水平比较高的，《辛亥革命》便是其中的一本。原因何在呢？请看下表（为求清晰，行数从略）：
    中国民族解放运动史（华岗著）  辛亥革命（高韶先著）    比较
    页一五九                      页二—三            叙述完全相同，
                                                      字句略有变易

    页一七六—一七九              页五八—六九        同上
    页一八○—一八一              页七四—七六        同上
    我所根据的《中国民族解放运动史》是一九四九年八月东北新华书店的初版本，这本《辛亥革命》的出版期是一九五○年一月。应该声明，我的校勘是很粗率的，遗漏的地方恐怕还有不少。而且，这个小册子仿佛不是从一个底本抄来的，如页六至一一，全部是从延安出版过而现在已停止发行的《中国现代革命运动史》的页五二至五六抄来的；页八二至八六，页九○至九一，又是从宋云彬先生的《中国近百年史》页一二○至一二二及页一二三抄来的。
