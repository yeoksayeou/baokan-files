Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd: According to reports from Kyodo News and Associated Press Tokyo: Five hundred thousand laboring people in Tokyo gathered in the plaza in front of the Tokyo Imperial Palace on the morning of the 1st to warmly celebrate May Day. An endless stream of people began converging on the venue from 7:00 AM local time. Prominently displayed in the center of the speaker's platform was a huge banner that read: "Strive for Peace and Independence, Promote Comprehensive Peace!" Other slogans at the venue included "Oppose Imperialist War," "Oppose Colonialism," "Oppose Building Okinawa into an American Military Base," "Immediately Conclude a Comprehensive Peace Treaty," and "We Demand Freedom and Independence."

Representatives from the Japanese Communist Party and the Labor-Farmer Party delivered speeches at the meeting. Representatives from the conservative Socialist Party also offered "congratulatory remarks" to the assembly. Nosaka Sanzō, a member of the Politburo of the Japanese Communist Party Central Committee, in his speech to the masses celebrating May Day, emphasized opposition to any foreign country maintaining military bases in Japan and opposition to imperialism preparing to launch wars of aggression. He said, "As long as we unite, we can prevent war." Nosaka's speech was met with enthusiastic applause.

The masses participating in the rally frequently sang the Internationale. The Japanese Communist Party's performing arts troupe performed songs and dances during the meeting. After passing a declaration against war, the masses at the rally raised red flags and held a demonstration.

The American and Japanese reactionaries adopted a vigilant stance towards the rally. Ten thousand police officers were ordered to be "on duty" and deployed along the march route.
