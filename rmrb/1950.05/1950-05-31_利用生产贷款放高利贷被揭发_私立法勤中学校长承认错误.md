　　Exploitation of Production Loans for Usury Exposed
    Principal of Private Faqun Middle School Admits Error
    [Beijing News Agency Report] The illegal use of school production loans for speculative profiteering by Private Faqun Middle School has been exposed. In order to support school production, the People's Bank of Beijing decided to provide loans to various schools at the lowest interest rates for production investment. In March of this year, Private Faqun Middle School obtained a full-year production loan of 3,000,240 yuan from the People's Bank, with a monthly interest rate of 0.75%. On April 7th, the school deposited 1,500,000 yuan of the loan into Jin Cheng Bank at a monthly interest rate of 1.2%, engaging in usury and speculative profiteering, violating the principle that special loans from the People's Bank must be used for their designated purposes. The school authorities neither announced this measure to the students nor reported it to the Municipal Production Guidance Committee. Upon learning of this matter, the People's Bank of Beijing and the Beijing Municipal School Production Committee went to the school to investigate and exposed the issue at an expanded meeting of the Municipal School Production Committee. The school then admitted its mistake to the Municipal Production Committee. The school's principal, Liu Bingzhe, should bear the primary responsibility for this matter. It should have been reported to the government for punishment according to the law, but since the school has admitted its error and is conducting a self-criticism, the Municipal Production Committee, the Bureau of Culture and Education, and the People's Bank of Beijing have agreed that, in addition to pointing out the nature of this error to the school and requiring them to continue conducting deep self-criticism and reflection, they should also be ordered to immediately withdraw the funds from Jin Cheng Bank and deposit them in the People's Bank instead.

　　利用生产贷款放高利贷被揭发
    私立法勤中学校长承认错误
    【京市新闻处讯】私立法勤中学非法利用学校生产贷款投机牟利已被揭发。人民银行北京分行为了扶助学校生产，决定以最低利率贷款给各校作为生产投资。私立法勤中学今年三月自人民银行取得全年生产贷款三百万零二百四十元，月利七分五厘。四月七日，该校将一百五十万元的贷款以月息十二分存入金城银行放高利贷，投机谋利，违背人民银行专用贷款必须专用的使用原则。该校当局对此措施，既不向同学宣布，又不报告市生产指导委员会。人民银行北京分行和北京市学校生产委员会得悉此事，即赴该校调查，并在市学校生产委员会扩大会议上揭发，该校始向市生产委员会承认错误。该校校长刘秉哲应负这件事情的主要责任。本当呈报政府依法处分，但该校既已承认错误和进行检讨，故经市生产委员会、文教局、人民银行北京分行商定，除向该校指出此次错误的性质要求他们仍继续进行深刻检讨反省外，并令其立即将款由金城银行取出，改存于人民银行。
