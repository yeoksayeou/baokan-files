　　Sino-Japanese Friendship Association Issues Statement
　　Perpetrators of Kisogawa Massacre Must Be Brought to Justice
	MacArthur Again Arbitrarily Releases Six Japanese War Criminals
　　【Xinhua News Agency, 14th】 Tokyo dispatch: The Sino-Japanese Friendship Association issued a statement on the 11th, demanding the punishment of Ishikawa Eijiro and Hanaoka, the two main culprits responsible for the massacre of one thousand Chinese prisoners of war in Kisogawa, Nagano Prefecture, during the war. From 1944 to 1945, 1,500 Chinese prisoners of war were forced to engage in construction work at the Mitake Hydroelectric Power Plant of Japan Electric Generation and Transmission Company, of whom 1,000 were brutally murdered. Ishikawa Eijiro was directly responsible for this massacre, and Hanaoka was then the Special Affairs Deputy Chief of Nagano Prefecture. The Sino-Japanese Friendship Association's statement denounces the fact that these two masterminds of the Kisogawa Massacre have not only escaped justice to this day but have also openly assumed new positions. Ishikawa is currently the president of the Tokai branch of Japan Electric Generation and Transmission Company, and Hanaoka is currently the chief of the Matsumoto City Police Department in Nagano Prefecture.
　　【Xinhua News Agency, 14th】 TASS dispatch from the 13th quoting Tokyo: MacArthur Headquarters announced on the 13th that six Japanese war criminals would be released from prison on the 19th before their sentences expire. They were all sentenced to imprisonment for mistreating Allied citizens in Shanghai and Japan. Each of them has only served about half of their five to six year sentences.
　　Note: This is the second time MacArthur has arbitrarily released Japanese war criminals based on the so-called "parole" method he unilaterally established on March 7th. The first group of six Japanese war criminals arbitrarily released by MacArthur were released on May 9th.

　　中日友协发表声明
　　木曾川惨案元凶必受裁判       
    麦克阿瑟又擅释日战犯六人
    【新华社十四日讯】东京消息：中日友好协会十一日发表声明，要求惩罚战时在日本长野县木曾川虐杀中国战俘一千人的两名主要凶手石川荣次郎和花冈。一九四四年至一九四五年，有一千五百名中国战俘被迫在日本发送电株式会社御岳水力发电厂从事建筑工程，其中有一千人曾惨遭虐杀。石川荣次郎是这次惨杀的直接负责人，花冈当时为长野县的特务副长官。中日友好协会的声明斥责这两个木曾川大惨案的元凶迄今不但未受到正义的裁判，并且公然出任新职。石川现为日本发送电株式会社东海支社社长，花冈现任长野县松本市警察局长。
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社十三日电引东京消息：麦克阿瑟总部于十三日宣布，日本战犯六名将于十九日在他们刑期届满之前释放出狱。他们都因为在上海和日本虐待盟国的公民而被判徒刑。他们每一个人约仅服满他们五年至六年刑期的一半。
    按：这是麦克阿瑟第二次根据他于三月七日擅自制订的所谓“假释”办法释放日本战犯。第一批被麦克阿瑟擅自释放的日本战犯六名，已于五月九日出狱。
