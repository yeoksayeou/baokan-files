Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai: The Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued the "Decision on Strengthening On-the-Job Cadre and Party Member Education" on the 6th.

The decision first pointed out: Since the liberation of Shanghai, the Party's propaganda work has concentrated its efforts on takeover work and conducting extensive propaganda and mobilization work among the masses. At the same time, it launched mass political study movements and established Party schools and night Party schools. Through these efforts, the smooth completion of the takeover work was ensured, the ideological and political levels of the masses, cadres, and students were initially improved, and the implementation of anti-blockade, anti-bombing, and the six major tasks was promoted. However, in terms of ideological education, this period only focused on temporary propaganda and mobilization work, and relaxed regular education work; it focused on propaganda and mobilization work among the masses, and relaxed regular education for Party members and cadres, thus causing the mass study movement to fall into a state of spontaneity to a certain extent; and the ideological and political levels of Party members and cadres could not be systematically improved. Currently, due to environmental influences and temporary, localized difficulties, certain serious ideological biases have grown. Now that the overall work has entered a new stage, the above-mentioned situation in propaganda and education work must be immediately reversed. According to the spirit of the Second Propaganda Conference held by the East China Bureau, the Party's ideological education should rapidly shift from being mainly propaganda and mobilization work to systematically conducting ideological education inside and outside the Party; regular education work should be appropriately combined with temporary propaganda and mobilization work, and systematic theoretical and cultural study should be appropriately combined with daily current affairs and policy study to meet the needs of the current situation and tasks.

The decision pointed out: From now on, the Party committee must regularly grasp the ideological situation of Party members, correctly use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, and combine rewards and punishments to educate Party members, break the phenomenon of vulgar peaceful coexistence and unprincipled disputes in life. At the same time, improve the system of political reports within the Party and the system of document reading. It is stipulated that political reports within the Party should be held every half month to one month. Seriously organize the reading of Party publications in accordance with the prescribed reading system. Strengthen spare-time Party schools, one is for branches to send representatives to attend classes and relay information back; the other is rotational training. Spare-time Party schools hold concentrated study sessions once a week; rotational training should be carried out with different targets for various different educations. Cadres should strengthen theoretical and policy study, but the learning focus of various cadres should be different. Old cadres with self-study ability are divided into Group A, focusing on the improvement of theory, and systematically studying the twelve theoretical books of "Cadres' Must-Read," mainly through self-study; those with a cultural level equivalent to that of senior primary school graduates and lacking a preliminary theoretical foundation and unable to study the twelve books should be divided into Group B, focusing on learning policies and preliminary theoretical books; new cadres and retained personnel should be divided into Group C, focusing on ideological transformation and policy education. Groups B and C will establish a weekly class system, with appropriate personnel from Group A serving as teachers, and the Municipal Study Committee will organize large classes and preparatory classes.

For cadres or janitorial staff with low cultural levels in the organs, it is stipulated that the main focus should be on learning culture. The main subjects are Chinese language and arithmetic, supplemented by common sense of history, geography, and natural science, and basic knowledge of the Chinese revolution. Universally establish amateur cultural schools for organs at the primary school level, establish a certain curriculum system and teachers, and try to ensure three hours of cultural learning every day.

The decision also pointed out: All cadres must study their professional work, especially using the arrangement and summary of work to improve their professional skills. In factories and technical departments, it is advocated to run amateur technical schools or tutoring classes. Cultivating worker cadres and worker Party members so that they can gradually master technology and participate in factory management should be regarded as an extremely important task in the Party's education.

In order to ensure learning, the decision stipulates that a system of scheduled study, inspection, and examinations must be adhered to. Cadres with excellent academic performance should be given spiritual and material rewards, and the attitude towards learning and the quality of academic performance should be used as one of the important criteria for evaluating and promoting cadres. The Study Committee should be enabled to become an institution that effectively leads learning, and the Study Committee of each unit should include personnel from administration, the Party, the Youth League, and the trade union. Party committees at all levels should take the study of leading cadres and Party members as one of their regular and main tasks. The Party's propaganda departments should regard this as their regular business.

The decision finally called on the responsible personnel of organizations at all levels to participate in learning without exception, formulate their own learning plans, implement them conscientiously, resolve the contradictions between work and learning, overcome the weaknesses of bureaucratism and empiricism, and improve their ideological level and leadership ability.

　　中共上海市委发布决定
　  加强在职干部与党员学习
　　系统进行党内外思想教育
    【新华社讯】上海消息：中共上海市委六日发布了《加强在职干部与党员教育的决定》。
    决定首先指出：上海解放以来，党的宣传工作曾集中力量于接管工作与在群众中进行广泛的宣传鼓动工作，同时发动了群众性的政治学习运动，举办了党校与夜党校，经过这些工作，保证了接管工作的顺利完成，初步提高了群众、干部与学员的思想政治水平，并推动了反封锁、反轰炸与六大任务的执行。但在思想教育上，这一时期只抓紧了临时的宣传鼓动工作，放松了经常的教育工作；抓紧了对群众的宣传鼓动工作，放松了对党员与干部的经常教育，因而使群众性的学习运动陷于某种程度的自流状态；而对党员与干部的思想政治水平，则不能作更有系统的提高。目前由于环境影响与暂时的局部的困难，滋长了某些严重的思想偏向。现在整个工作已经进入一个新的阶段，宣教工作中的上述情况，必须立即转变过来。根据华东局所召开的第二次宣传会议的精神，在党的思想教育上，应迅速由以宣传鼓动工作为主的情况转为系统地进行党内外思想教育；应当把经常教育工作与临时性的宣传鼓动工作适当地结合起来，把系统的理论、文化学习与日常的时事政策学习适当的结合起来，以适合目前形势与任务的需要。
    该决定指出：党委今后要经常地掌握党员的思想情况，正确地运用批评与自我批评的武器，结合奖励与处分，来教育党员，打破生活上庸俗的和平相处与无原则纠纷的现象。同时健全党内政治报告制度与文件阅读制度。规定党内政治报告每半月至一月举行一次。按照规定的阅读制度，认真组织党刊的阅读。加强业余党校，一种是支部推派代表听课，回去传达；一种是轮训。业余党校每周集中学习一次；轮训应以不同的对象来进行各种不同的教育。干部应加强理论政策学习，但各种干部的学习重点应有不同。有自修能力的老干部编为甲组，着重理论的提高，有计划地学习十二本《干部必读》理论书籍，以自修为主；相当于高小毕业的文化程度和缺乏初步理论基础而不能学习十二本书籍的应编为乙组，着重学习政策与初步理论书籍；新干部与留用人员应编为丙组，着重思想改造与政策教育。乙组和丙组都建立每周一次的上课制度，由甲组中的适当人员担任教员，而由市学委会组织上大课和准备课。
    对机关中文化程度低的干部或勤杂人员，规定以学习文化为主。主要学习国文、算术二科，辅之以史地和自然科学的常识与中国革命的基本知识，普遍建立小学程度的机关业余文化学校，设立一定的课程制度与教员，尽量保证每天有三小时的文化学习。
    决定又指出：所有干部都须学习业务，特别是利用工作的布置与总结，提高业务。在工厂与技术部门，提倡举办业余技术学校或补习班。培养工人干部与工人党员使之能逐渐掌握技术参加工厂管理，应作为党的教育中极端重要的任务。
    为着保证学习，决定规定要坚持定时学习、检查与考试制度。对学习成绩优良的干部应给予精神的物质的奖励，并把学习态度学习成绩的好坏，作为鉴定与提拔干部的重要标准之一。要使学委会能成为切实领导学习的机构，各单位的学委会应包括行政、党、青年团、工会各方面的人员。各级党委应将领导干部与党员的学习，作为经常的主要工作之一。党的宣传部门更应以此作为自己的经常业务。
    决定最后号召各级组织的负责人员，无例外地参加学习，订出自己的学习计划，认真实行，解决工作与学习的矛盾，克服事务主义与经验主义的弱点，提高自己的思想水平与领导能力。
