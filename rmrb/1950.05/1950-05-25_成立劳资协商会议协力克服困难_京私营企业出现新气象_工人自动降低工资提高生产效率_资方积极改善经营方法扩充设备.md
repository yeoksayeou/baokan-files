　　Labor-Management Consultation Meetings Established to Overcome Difficulties: New Atmosphere Appears in Beijing's Private Enterprises
　　Workers Voluntarily Reduce Wages and Increase Production Efficiency; Capitalists Actively Improve Management Methods and Expand Equipment

　　[Our Newspaper] Private factories and stores in Beijing that have established labor-management consultation meetings have begun to show a new atmosphere under the slogan of labor and management working together to overcome difficulties.

　　Through labor-management consultation meetings, the understanding of "mutual benefit for labor and capital" has been raised a step further for both sides. First, workers are automatically improving production efficiency and product quality. Some private factories, facing serious difficulties, have seen workers voluntarily reduce wages. For example, at Hengdecheng Weaving Factory, workers originally watched one power loom each; now they watch two looms each, squeezing out some labor and increasing the number of night shifts. As a result, the factory's total output in April increased by 38 percent compared to March, and the planned output for May is 62 percent higher than March. Housheng Match Factory originally produced 28 boxes of matches per day, but has now increased to 35 boxes. The factory workers also signed a temporary agreement with the capitalists to reduce wages and strive for savings, voluntarily changing the wage payment method from retail price of Fudi millet to wages based on millet price. In the past, the capitalists provided workers with firewood and shavings at no cost, but now the workers pay for it themselves. In this way, the factory saved 15,000 jin of millet in April alone. Another example is Jingwei Weaving Factory, where workers carefully calculated production costs and various expenses within the factory, and voluntarily reduced wages for two months (starting from May). Each worker's wage was reduced by 19 to 27 percent. In addition, raw materials were saved and the quality of finished products was improved. The output of Grade A cloth produced by the factory accounted for 45 percent of the total output in March, but increased to 80 percent in April. Now, the factory is not only no longer losing money every month, but can also earn more than 8,000 jin of millet. Zhang Huamin, a worker at the factory, said: "We know that we must focus on long-term interests, so it is right to tighten our belts temporarily and get through this difficult month!" Secondly, after the establishment of labor-management consultation meetings, the capitalists have also increased their enthusiasm for management. For example, Hengdecheng Weaving Factory is now adding workers and preparing to fully open all 32 power looms for night shifts. The capitalists of Housheng Match Factory guarantee a full supply of raw materials without stopping work, and are raising funds to purchase raw materials in Tianjin. The capitalists of Jingwei Weaving Factory have even increased their confidence in overcoming the current difficulties and are preparing to pay off the debt of more than 600,000 jin of millet, install four machines, and expand production.

　　Labor-management consultation meetings play a significant role in improving the unreasonable management methods of private industry and commerce. For example, Hengdecheng Weaving Factory had too many redundant staff in the past, but now five people have joined the production. Ruifuxiang Cloth Store has changed its old business perspective and adopted a strategy of small profits and quick turnover. In the past, the average daily sales were only 4 to 5 million yuan, but in April the average daily sales exceeded 20 million yuan. In this way, the capitalists not only paid off public bonds, taxes, and bank loans of 50 million yuan, but also had a surplus. Tongheju Restaurant changed its business strategy, turning to the working people and establishing a snack section, and business has improved. Tongheju Restaurant originally had seven people at the counter who were not actively engaged in business and shirked responsibility when things happened; after the establishment of the labor-management consultation meeting, a person in charge was selected, and the management method was also improved. Now, more private industrial and commercial enterprises have recognized the direction and know that to solve the difficulties in production and business, the capitalists must actively improve management methods, and the workers must give full play to their production enthusiasm. Both sides must work together. For example, Xinghua Rubber Factory, after liberation, the workers worked hard to produce and increased output by 20 percent, but due to the capitalists' poor management, the business has not developed well in the past year. Now the capitalists have recognized this, and after consultation meetings, they are focusing on improving management methods and absorbing new capital of 200 million yuan to expand production equipment.

　　The initial results of the establishment of labor-management consultation meetings in Beijing's private industry and commerce have made the factories and stores realize that only through labor-management cooperation can they overcome difficulties.

　　成立劳资协商会议协力克服困难
    京私营企业出现新气象       
    工人自动降低工资提高生产效率  资方积极改善经营方法扩充设备
    【本报讯】北京市成立了劳资协商会议的私营工厂、商店，在劳资协力渡过难关的口号下，开始出现了新的气象。
    通过劳资协商会议，劳资双方对“劳资两利”的认识，都较前提高一步。首先是工人自动提高生产效率和产品质量。有一部分私营工厂，因为有严重的困难，工人自愿降低工资。如恒德成织布厂，原来每个工人看一台电力机，现在改为每人看两台机子，挤出一部分劳动力，增加了一部分夜班。因此该厂四月份总产量较三月份增加了百分之三十八；五月份计划的产量较三月份增加了百分之六十二。厚生火柴厂，原来日产二十八箱火柴，现已增至三十五箱。该厂工人并和资方订立减低工资、努力节约的临时协议，自愿将原来按照伏地小米零售价支付的工资改为按工资米价支付。过去资方无价配给工人劈柴、刨花等物，现在改由工人出钱购买。这样，该厂四月份即节省了一万五千斤小米。又如经纬织布厂，工人把生产成本和厂内各项开支，精打细算后，自愿降低工资两个月（由五月份起）。每人工资降低了百分之十九至二十七。此外还节省了原料，提高了成品的质量。该厂所制甲布的产量，三月份占总产量百分之四十五，四月份提高到占总产量的百分之八十。现在每月不仅不再亏累，且能赚到八千余斤小米。该厂工人张化民说：“我们知道要从长远的利益着眼，所以暂时勒紧一点裤带，渡过这个背月，是应该的！”其次，成立劳资协商会议之后，资方也提高了经营的积极性。如恒德成织布厂现正增添工人，准备把三十二台电力机，全部增开夜班。厚生火柴厂资方保证充分供给原料，不停工，并筹款到天津购买原料。经纬织布厂资方更提高了渡过目前困难的信心，准备把六十多万斤小米的债务偿清后，按装四部机器，扩大生产。
    劳资协商会议，对于改善私营工商业不合理的经营方法，有很大作用。如恒德成织布厂过去冗员太多，现在有五名参加了生产。瑞蚨祥布店改变了旧的营业观点，采取薄利多销的方针。过去每天平均只售货四、五百万元，四月份每日平均售货已超过两千万元。这样资方不但交清了公债、税款，还清了银行借款五千万元，而且尚有盈余。同和居饭庄改变经营方针，转向劳动人民，成立小吃部，营业已呈好转。同和居饭庄，柜上原有七人，不积极经营，遇事互相推诿；成立劳资协商会议后，选出负责人，也改善了经营方法。现在有更多的私营工商业都认识了方向，知道了要解决生产和业务上的困难，必须资方积极改善经营方法，劳方发挥生产积极性，双方协力。例如兴华橡胶厂，解放后劳方努力生产，提高了产量百分之二十，但由于资方经营不善，所以一年来营业并没有得到很好发展。现在资方已认识了这一点，经协商会议后，着重改善经营方法，并吸收新股金两亿元，以扩充生产设备。
    北京市的私营工商业成立劳资协商会议的初步结果，使各工厂、商店认清了只有劳资协力，才能渡过难关。
