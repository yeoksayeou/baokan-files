　　Several Village Cadres in the Suburbs of Beijing Corrected for Embezzlement and Waste
    The 19th District Government of Beijing suburbs began to inspect village finances in early April, strictly controlling finances, practicing strict economy, and investigating embezzlement, waste, and all illegal apportionments. It was discovered that Sun Deliang, Yang Qingbo, and Yin Hai, the responsible cadres of the Gucheng Village Water Conservancy Association, privately apportioned fees to water-irrigated land households in the autumn of last year, collecting 1.3 catties of corn per mu, totaling 3,150 catties of corn. Only 1,800 catties were spent, and the rest was embezzled by the three for their own use. Li Changquan, the deputy chief of Liuniangfu Village, purchased a large cart and a waterwheel for the local garrison in March of this year, underreporting the price and embezzling 130,000 yuan in People's Currency. Diao Wenshu, the deputy village chief of Sanheishitou Village, privately apportioned grain, hired private couriers, and engaged in immoral behavior in the village. In addition to recovering all the embezzled grain and money from the above village cadres, they have all been given the penalty of being removed from their positions. In addition, the village cadres of Yamenkou Village established an old lantern festival during the Lantern Festival, erecting lantern sheds and buying incense paper, raising a total of 1,459,550 yuan in People's Currency from the people, all of which was spent on superstition. Recently, Li Yongjiang, the village chief of Xihuang Village, and others ate three bags of foreign flour while filling out state-owned land use certificates (a total of 369 copies), also intending to take advantage of the fruits of victory. Before the Lunar New Year, the drama performance in Gaojing Village cost 400 catties of corn, which was paid for from the fruits of victory. Mayu Village and Pang Village raised hundreds of thousands of yuan in People's Currency to establish a drama troupe. Wulituo Village spent 300 catties of millet to build a decorative archway. The district government has severely criticized the above-mentioned lawbreakers. It is also stipulated that in the future, except for legitimate and necessary expenses approved by the district government, no apportionment or fundraising from the masses will be allowed.

　　京郊若干村干部贪污浪费被纠正
    京郊十九区政府于四月初开始检查村财政，严格管制财政，厉行节约，清查贪污、浪费及一切非法摊派等行为，发现古城村水利会负责干部孙德良、杨清波、殷海三人在去年秋天私自向水地户摊派，每亩玉米一斤三两共收玉米三、一五○斤，只开支了一、八○○斤，其余被三人贪污花用。刘娘府村副李长全，今年三月间给当地驻军代购大车一辆、水车一架，价款以少报多，从中贪污人民券十三万元。三黑石头村村副刁文树私自摊派粮食，雇佣私人通讯员，并在村中搞破鞋。以上村干除已将其贪污的全部粮款追回外，均受撤职处分。另外，衙门口村干在元宵节时成立老灯会，搭灯棚买香纸共向老百姓募捐人民券一、四五九、五五○元，全部花费在迷信上。最近西黄村村长李永江等在填写国有土地使用证（共三六九份）时，吃了三袋洋面，亦想从胜利果实中抽支。旧历年前高井村演剧花费玉米四○○斤，系从胜利果实中开支的。麻峪村、庞村共募捐人民券数十万，作成立剧团时的花用。五里坨村搭花牌楼花费小米三百斤。该区政府对以上违法人员，已予以严重批评。并且规定：今后除经区政府批准的正当必要开支外，一律不准向群众摊派或募捐一分钱。
