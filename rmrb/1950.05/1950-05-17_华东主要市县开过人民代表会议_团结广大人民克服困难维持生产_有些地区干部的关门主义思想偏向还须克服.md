Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th—Major cities and counties in the East China region have generally convened People's Representative Conferences of all circles. These conferences have played a significant role in mobilizing and uniting the broad masses of the people, opposing the blockade and bombing by American imperialism and the Kuomintang remnants, overcoming difficulties, and maintaining and restoring production. From August of last year to the end of March this year, out of 69 cities with a population of over 30,000 and 414 counties in the region, preliminary statistics show that 67 cities and 327 counties have successively held one to four People's Representative Conferences of all circles.

Since Rao Shushi, Secretary of the East China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, put forward the six major tasks of the East China people at the first Shanghai Municipal People's Representative Conference of all circles held in early August last year, the People's Representative Conferences of all circles in various parts of East China have generally discussed and implemented the anti-blockade work in accordance with this call. At the same time, various localities have focused on solving several major problems based on specific circumstances and the urgent needs of the people. The People's Representative Conferences of all circles in cities such as Shanghai, Qingdao, and Wuxi focused on discussing the maintenance, restoration, and development of production, resolving labor-capital relations, strengthening the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, promoting public bonds, consolidating taxation, and providing relief to the unemployed. The People's Representative Conferences of all circles in disaster areas such as northern Anhui and northern Jiangsu, and in various cities in Shandong Province, focused on discussing production for disaster relief and the work of harnessing the Yellow River. The conferences in coastal cities in Fujian Province discussed supporting the front lines, preparing for the liberation of Taiwan, and established organizations to support the army and the front lines. The newly liberated areas generally focused on the central tasks of suppressing bandits, reducing rent, and opposing local bullies.

In summarizing the work of the People's Government and discussing various policies, the conferences in various regions promoted people's democracy, carried out criticism and self-criticism, educated cadres, raised the awareness of the masses, enhanced the unity of all classes, strengthened the connection between the government and the broad masses of the people, and enabled the smooth implementation of various government tasks and policies among the masses. Many representatives from Dezhou County, Shandong Province, who participated in the conference, were moved after listening to the government's work report and self-criticism, and said: "In the past, we thought that the government was the superior and we were the guests, which was wrong. Now we understand that the People's Government is for the people, and we are the masters of the People's Government." In the two cities of Nantong and Yangzhou in northern Jiangsu, the people of all circles raised 30 shi of rice within 20 days after the representative conferences to help more than 10,000 disaster victims tide over the Spring Festival. The public bond tasks in major and medium-sized cities such as Hangzhou and Jinan have been successfully overfulfilled due to the promotion of the People's Representative Conferences of all circles. At the People's Representative Conference of all circles in Taizhou, northern Jiangsu, the representatives conducted serious and well-intentioned criticism of the tax evasion behavior of the industrial and commercial sectors, which also promoted the smooth progress of tax collection work.

However, since most of East China is a newly liberated area, there are still some shortcomings and biases in the conferences in various regions. In some areas, the conferences did not pay enough attention to the speeches of the representatives, and more or less showed closed-doorism tendencies. For example, when Tunxi held the first People's Representative Conference of all circles, some cadres thought that it was enough for them to give speeches, which resulted in the conference being merely a formality. Some areas lacked preparation for the conferences, and the conference organization was not sound, or there was a phenomenon of "holding meetings for the sake of holding meetings." A few cadre representatives were not very concerned about the meetings, and some did not come themselves, but casually found someone to replace them. Some cities did not grasp the central issues to be resolved at the conferences, and made resolutions on all the proposals, making it impossible to accurately complete the resolutions. In other places, the conferences were not good at adopting a consultative approach, and there was no extensive publicity among the masses before the meeting, the reports were too long, and there was too little discussion, so the resolutions could not be implemented after the meeting. These shortcomings are being corrected.

　　华东主要市县开过人民代表会议
　　团结广大人民克服困难维持生产
　　有些地区干部的关门主义思想偏向还须克服
    【新华社上海十五日电】华东区各主要市、县已普遍召开各界人民代表会议。这些会议在动员和团结广大人民、反对美帝国主义与国民党残匪的封锁和轰炸、克服困难、维持并恢复生产等方面，曾发挥了重大作用。自去年八月到今年三月底为止，全区六十九个三万人口以上的城市和四百一十四个县，据初步统计，已有六十七个城市和三百二十七个县先后召开了一次到四次各界人民代表会议。
    自中共中央华东局书记饶漱石在去年八月初举行的上海市第一届各界人民代表会议上提出了华东人民当前的六大任务后，华东各地各界人民代表会议均依据这一号召，普遍讨论和贯彻了反封锁的工作。同时，各地并根据特殊情况和人民的迫切需要，有重点地解决了若干重大问题。上海、青岛和无锡等城市的各界人民代表会议着重讨论了维持、恢复与发展生产，解决劳资关系，加强城乡物资交流，推销公债，整理税收及救济失业等问题。皖北、苏北等灾区和山东省各城市的各界人民代表会议则着重讨论了生产救灾和治理黄河的工作。福建省沿海各城市的会议讨论了支援前线、准备解放台湾，并成立了拥军及支援前线的组织。新解放区则一般以剿匪、减租和反恶霸等为中心任务。
    各地会议在总结人民政府的工作和讨论各种政策中，发扬了人民民主，开展了批评和自我批评，教育了干部，提高了群众的认识，增进了各阶层团结，加强了政府与广大群众的联系，使政府的各项任务和政策得以顺利地贯彻到群众中去。山东德州县参加会议的许多代表们，在听了政府的工作报告和自我批评后，都感动地说：过去认为政府是上级、我们是客人都错了。现在才明白人民政府就是为了人民，我们就是人民政府的主人。苏北南通、扬州二市各界人民在代表会议后的二十天内，募集大米三十石，帮助万余灾民渡过春节。杭州、济南等各大、中城市的公债任务，由于各界人民代表会议的推动，都已胜利地超额完成。苏北泰州的各界代表会议上，代表们对工商界的漏税行为，进行了认真而善意的批评，也推动了税收工作的顺利进行。
    但是，由于华东大部分地区是新解放区，各地的会议还存在某些缺点和偏向。有些地区的会议，对代表们的发言不够重视，或多或少地表现了关门主义的思想偏向。如屯溪在举行第一届各界人民代表会议时，某些干部以为会议只由自己讲讲话就够了，结果使会议徒具形式。有些地区对会议缺乏准备，会议组织也不健全，或存在着“为开会而开会”的现象。少数干部代表对会议不很关心，有的自己不来，随便找人代替。某些城市对会议要解决的中心问题掌握不住，将许多提案统统作了决议，使决议无法准确完成。另一些地方的会议不善于采取协商方式，会前在群众中没有进行广泛的宣传，会中报告太长，讨论太少，因而会后不能把决议贯彻下去。这些缺点正在纠正中。
