　　Shanghai's Price Struggle
　　By our special correspondent Zhou Ziqin

            I. The Great Change of 1950
    Since February 1950, a significant change has occurred in Shanghai's prices. This change indicates that Shanghai's prices have entered a new stage of stability in 1950. Furthermore, because Shanghai is China's largest economic center, the stability of Shanghai's prices can play a significant role in stabilizing prices nationwide. This is of great importance for the peaceful economic construction of the country in the future.
    Anyone familiar with Shanghai knows that it is a place where speculative capital is concentrated, and speculative merchants are most adept at speculation and hoarding. During the period when the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang ruled Shanghai, they relied on malignant inflation to reap huge profits from soaring prices. After the liberation of Shanghai, they employed their usual tricks to disrupt the market and drive up prices. Therefore, from the very first day of Shanghai's liberation, the people's government's financial and trade departments launched a fierce struggle against them. Until February of this year, after four price fluctuations over ten months, they continuously repelled the attacks of the speculators, completely gained the initiative, and won the victory in the price struggle. Since February of this year, various prices have successively fallen. Rice fell from 270,000 yuan in March to 250,000 yuan on April 21st, and Dragon Head Fine Cloth fell from 314,000 yuan per bolt on March 1st to 255,000 yuan on April 21st. Other commodities have also fallen across the board. By the end of April, coal, electricity, trams, buses, haircuts, restaurants, sesame cakes, fried dough sticks, etc., had also been reduced in price. Currently, things are trending toward stability. This is a new transformation from more than ten years of skyrocketing prices to stability.

            II. Four Price Fluctuations
    Before the liberation of Shanghai, because Shanghai was surrounded on all sides, the puppet Gold Yuan was effectively waste paper, and gold bars and silver dollars became the currency for market transactions. After liberation, the people's government spent only 400 million yuan in Renminbi to completely exchange the puppet Gold Yuan in the work of eliminating the puppet Gold Yuan, without encountering any resistance. However, gold, US dollars, and silver dollars, especially silver dollars, were more stubborn and not easily defeated for a time. And stirred up a rising wind. By June 9, silver dollars were up 267 percent and gold 303 percent. As a result, rice also rose by 323 percent, and yarn actually tripled in ten days. The main reason for the price surge was that special agents and speculators used the fear of the puppet currency left over from the past to carry out a conspiracy to undermine the Renminbi. They directed tens of thousands of silver dollar peddlers in the Securities Building to speculate in silver dollars and disrupt the market. In order to crack down on silver dollar speculation, after good publicity and education work, the government took one fell swoop and destroyed the command center of the silver dollar speculators - the Securities Building, and detained more than 200 of the leading special agents and evildoers, severely hitting the first-rate special agents and speculators.
    The second wave began on June 23. This wave started with yarn and reached its peak on July 21. And it caused the rise in grain prices. By the end of July, the upward index was: rice 1,140 percent, flour 535 percent, yarn 460 percent, cloth 405 percent, gold 384 percent, and silver 323 percent. The reason for the fluctuation was: the increase in currency issuance in the economy, coupled with the activities of speculators. After the Securities Building was destroyed, the special agents and saboteurs saw that gold and silver speculation was impossible, so they turned to the commodity market, using yarn and cloth as speculative objects, forming a leading rise in yarn and cloth. In addition, the floods in various places and the disruption of transportation, the speculators also used the anxiety of the masses to drive up rice prices, causing rice prices to rise sharply.
    The third time was the October price surge, which was a nationwide price fluctuation. From rising by 2 to 3 percent at the beginning of the month, it rose to more than 90 percent by the end of the month. Cloth and yarn rose by an average of 70 percent at the end of the month compared to the previous month, and rice rose by an average of 10 percent compared to the previous month. The reasons are: 1. The expansion of the new areas increased the actual sales of Shanghai yarn and cloth; 2. After the liberation of Guangzhou, people's confidence in the sales prospects of yarn and cloth greatly increased; 3. The release of funds for the purchase of goods in North China, coupled with the poor harvest of grain, the rise in grain prices also led to the rise in cotton, yarn and cloth; 4. The activities of speculative commercial capital.
    The fourth time was this year's January (around the Lunar New Year), when prices rose by 80 percent. The reasons are: 1. Inflation has not ended; 2. The speed of grain transportation to Shanghai could not keep up; 3. The liberation of cities in Central and South China, especially reflected in the price fluctuations in Central South China (Hankou, Guangzhou). However, this price surge was quickly stopped under the unified leadership of the Central Government.

            III. Mastering Major Supplies is the Key to Victory
    The struggle against the above four price fluctuations was very intense. And in each struggle, the financial and trade departments of the people's government achieved victory. And the grain and cotton yarn and cloth, which played the most important role in the struggle, have been fully mastered and supplied in large quantities.
    In the struggle, the first step was to crack down on speculative merchants. For example, in the first price fluctuation, because the silver dollar speculation in the Securities Building was cracked down, and the first-class leading evildoers were detained, and the gold and silver trading market was destroyed, the Renminbi was widely circulated in the market and became the currency for market transactions, and the exchange of silver dollars and foreign currency was listed, and savings were made at a discount, and the prestige of the Renminbi was established. The second is to strictly manage the market, practice strict economy, tighten expenditures, and formulate various trading regulations, such as prohibiting off-site transactions, unifying transaction times, requiring cash settlement on the same day, prohibiting part-time business, and prohibiting futures warrant trading, etc., to reduce loopholes for speculation. The third is to sort out land prices and taxes, commodity taxes, vigorously sell grain and cotton yarn and cloth, increase currency withdrawal, tighten currency, and strive for supply balance.
    But, the main key lies in the Central Government's overall planning and unified deployment of national materials, so that the trade departments fully grasp the important materials needed by the people, such as grain, cotton yarn and cloth, coal, oil, and so on. Before the Lunar New Year, merchants, seeing the severe floods in various places last year, the poor harvest, the lack of transportation, and the inability to transport foreign grain, believed that grain prices would definitely rise sharply, and that the spring famine would be very profitable. In addition, grain prices rose slightly at that time, so they bought a lot of grain. At that time, white rice was 307,000 yuan per stone, but the Shanghai Grain Company sold it at a price of 280,000 yuan in order to suppress the price rise, and the merchants bought it desperately, thinking that there was an opportunity to take advantage of it. From February 21st, the Shanghai Grain Company sold more than 40,000 stones on the first day, and more than 30,000 stones on the second and third days, and sold a total of more than 270,000 stones for seven or eight days. And the merchants had reached saturation after absorbing it, and could no longer afford to buy it. Then the Shanghai Grain Company began to establish retail stores and establish direct contact with the vast working masses, and successively established more than 50 stores. At that time, the market price of rice was 280,000 per stone, and the retail price was 285,000 yuan. Since February 24th, few citizens bought grain, and rice shops were deserted. After the 25th, rice shops could not sell grain, and the accumulated funds could not be turned around. In addition, many rice shop owners borrowed money at high interest rates when buying in large quantities. The interest was high and they were eager to repay the loans, so they had to lower grain prices. Competing to sell, just as the local proverb says: stealing chickens is not worth losing a handful of rice. Therefore, among the 2,495 rice shops, 30 percent applied for closure due to speculation failure. And the banks and money shops that operated this kind of high-interest lending also failed because the funds were frozen and the funds released could not be recovered, resulting in many closures. At this point, Shanghai's prices have been stable and unwavering. Since March, various prices have successively fallen, and have been trending toward stability since the beginning of this month, and have begun to create favorable conditions for the steady progress of Shanghai's industry and commerce.

            IV. Conditions for Ensuring Stable Prices in Shanghai
    After more than ten months of struggle and efforts, Shanghai's prices have been successfully stabilized. Although there will be many difficulties, they will definitely be overcome. The reason is: First, thanks to the unified cooperation of the whole country and the further development of mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, the unified deployment of national materials has guaranteed the supply of materials in Shanghai. The free flow of national materials to all parts of the country has provided Shanghai with sufficient material supply, which has greatly reduced the opportunities for speculation by speculators. Second, after more than ten months of struggle, we have gained very valuable experience, which is of great significance for mastering the Shanghai market in the future and consolidating the victory in the price struggle. If we say that in the past ten months or so, we still had no experience, did not understand the Shanghai market, and faced the huge speculative capital accumulated over hundreds of years, and the merchants who were most adept at speculation and hoarding, but we can still achieve victory, then in the future, after ten months of struggle, we have gained the experience of struggle, then in the future, we will have more confidence in the control of market prices. But this does not mean that we should not pay attention to the possibility of speculators taking advantage of the opportunity to move. Third, in the past struggles, Shanghai speculators have suffered serious political and economic blows and failures. For example, the destruction of the Securities Building speculation center, the October price surge last year, and around the Lunar New Year this year, the first, second, and third-rate speculators have suffered heavy blows, giving speculators a great lesson: only legitimate business has a future, and speculators will inevitably go bankrupt and be destroyed. Fourth, the establishment of a wide range of retail networks has strengthened ties with the vast working people, making it impossible for merchants to monopolize the market. These are the guarantees that Shanghai will be able to overcome difficulties, consolidate victory, and achieve success in stabilizing prices in the future.

　　上海的物价斗争
    本报特派记者　周子芹
            一、一九五零年的巨大变化
    一九五○年二月以来，上海的物价发生了一个重大的变化。这个变化表示出：一九五○年的上海物价，已走上了一个新的稳定的阶段。同时，由于上海又是中国最大的经济中心，上海物价的稳定，也就可能对全国物价的稳定，起着重大的作用。这对今后国内的和平经济建设，有着很重要的意义。
    了解上海情况的人，都知道上海是游资集中之地，而投机商人是最善于投机囤积的。在蒋匪帮统治上海的时期中，他们都依靠着恶性通货膨胀，在物价狂涨中，大获暴利。上海解放之后，他们更施展其一贯故技，捣乱市场，哄抬物价。因此，从上海解放的第一天起，人民政府的金融贸易部门，就和他们展开了猛烈的斗争。一直到今年二月，在整整十个月中，经过了四次物价波动，连续打退了投机商的进攻，才完全取得了主动，获得了物价斗争的胜利。今年二月以来，各种物价均相继下落。大米由三月份的二十七万元降到四月二十一日的二十五万元，龙头细布由三月一号每匹三十一万四千元，降到四月二十一日的二十五万五千元。其他各种商品均一致下落。到四月底，煤炭、电力、电车、公共汽车、理发、饭馆、烧饼、油条等等亦相继减价。目前已趋向稳定。这是十多年来物价一直从飞跃上升而转向平稳的新的转变。
            二、四次物价波动
    上海解放前，由于上海四面被围，伪金圆券在事实上已成废纸，金钞、银元就成了市场交易的通货。解放后，人民政府在肃清伪金圆券的工作上，只花了四亿元人民币就全部兑换完了，没有受到任何的抵抗，而黄金、美钞、银元、尤以银元却较顽强，一时不易战胜。且又掀起了涨风。涨到六月九日，银元是百分之二六七，黄金是百分之三○三。因而米也涨了百分之三二三，纱布竟在十天之内涨达三倍。涨风的主要原因是由于特务及投机商利用群众对伪币过去所遗留下来的恐惧心理，进行对人民币的阴谋破坏。他们在证券大楼指挥着几万个银元贩子，作银元投机买卖，捣乱市场。为了打击银元投机，政府在经过了很好的宣传教育工作之后，一举而扑灭了银元投机商的司令台——证券大楼，把首要特务和作恶分子二百多人全部扣押，使第一流的特务及投机商人受到了严重的打击。
    第二次波动是六月二十三日开始。这次波动首先从纱开始，至七月二十一日达最高潮。且引起了粮价的上涨。至七月底，上升指数是：米百分之一、一四○，面百分之五三五，纱百分之四六○，布百分之四○五，金百分之三八四，银百分之三二三。波动的原因是：经济上的通货发行增加，加上了投机商的兴风作浪。自证券大楼扑灭之后，特务破坏分子看到金银投机已不可能，于是转向商品市场，以纱布作为投机对象，形成了纱布带头上涨。再加以各地水灾，舟车不通，投机商又利用群众的不安心理，哄抬米价，以致米价随即猛烈上涨。
    第三次是十月涨风，这是一次带有全国性的物价波动。由月初日升百分之二到三，到月底即上升到百分之九十以上。布与纱月终较上月平均上升百分之七十，米较上月平均上升百分之十。原因是：一、新区扩大，上海纱布实销增多；二、广州解放后，人们对纱布销售前途信心大增；三、华北收购资金出笼，加上粮食歉收，粮价上涨也引起了棉、纱、布的上涨；四、投机商业资本的活动。
    第四次是今年一月（阴历年关前后），物价上涨达百分之八十。原因是：一、通货膨胀尚未终了；二、调运上海粮食的速度赶不上；三、中南各城市的解放，特别是表现在华中南物价（汉口、广州）的波动影响。但这次涨风在中央统一领导下，很快就停止了。
            三、掌握主要物资是胜利的关键
    以上四次物价波动的斗争，是很剧烈的。而且每次斗争的结果，人民政府的金融贸易部门都取得了胜利。而斗争中演着最主要脚色的粮食和花纱布，已能充分的掌握，大量的供应。
    在斗争中，首先是打击投机商人，如在第一次物价波动中，因为打击了证券大楼的银元投机，把第一流的首要作恶分子扣押起来，摧毁了金银买卖市场，就使人民币广泛在市场上流通起来，成为市场交易的通货，并实施银元、外钞挂牌兑换、举办折实存储，建立了人民币的威信。其次是严格管理市场，厉行节约，紧缩开支，制订各种交易法规，如禁止场外交易，划一交易时间，必须现款当日交割，不得兼做业外生意，禁止期货栈单买卖等，减少投机的空子。第三是整理地价税、货物税，大力抛售粮食和花纱布，增加货币回笼，紧缩通货，并力求供应平衡。
    但，主要的关键，还在于中央对全国物资的通盘筹划和统一调度，使贸易部门充分的掌握了人民所需要的重要物资，如粮食、花纱布、煤炭、油等等。旧历年关前商人曾因看到去年各地水灾严重，年成歉收，交通工具缺乏，外粮运不来，便认为粮价一定大涨，春荒大有赚头，加上当时粮价微升，就大量抢购粮食。当时白粳每石三十万七千元，但上海粮食公司为压低物价涨势，就以二十八万元的牌价放手抛售，商人们以为有机可乘，就拚命吸进。从二月二十一日起，上海粮食公司第一天就卖了四万多石，第二天，第三天都是三万石以上，一直卖了七八天，共卖出粮食二十七万多石。而商人吸进已达饱和状态，再也无力买进了。随着上海粮食公司又开始建立零售店，直接与广大劳动群众建立联系，先后共建立五十多家。当时市场米价每石二十八万，零售二十八万五千元。二月二十四日开始，市民买粮的很少，米店无人问津。二十五号以后，各米店因粮食不能出手，积压资金，周转不灵，加上许多米店老板在抢购时，多以高利借款，利息既高，急于还款，不得不压低粮价。竞相出售，正如当地谚语所说的：偷鸡不到蚀了一把米。因而在二千四百九十五家米店中，因投机失败而申请歇业者达百分之三十。而经营此种高利借贷的银行、钱庄，亦因资金冻结，放出的资金收不回，以致发生倒闭者不少。至此，上海物价一直平稳无波，三月以来，各种物价更相继下落，直至本月初趋向稳定，开始创造了上海工商业稳步前进的有利条件。
            四、保证上海物价平稳的条件
    经过了十个多月的斗争和努力，上海的物价是成功地稳定了。虽然还会有很多困难，但是一定能够克服的。道理就在于：第一、由于全国的统一配合，城乡互助的进一步发展，全国物资的统一调度，保证了上海物资的供应。使全国物资互相畅流各地，使上海有了充分的物资供应，这就大大减少了投机商人的可乘之机。第二、经过十个多月的斗争以后，我们已经取得了很宝贵的经验，这对今后掌握上海市场，巩固物价斗争的胜利，有很大的意义。如果说在过去十个多月中，我们尚没有经验，不了解上海市场情况，面前碰到的又是百多年来积累起来的巨大投机资本，和最善于投机囤积的商人，但我们仍然还能取得胜利，那么在今后，在经过了十个月的斗争之后，已经有了斗争的经验，那么，今后在市场物价的掌握上，就会更加有了胜利的把握。但这并不是就不必注意投机商仍有趁机而动的可能性了。第三、在过去的斗争中，上海投机商已受到了政治上、经济上的严重打击和失败。如扑灭证券大楼投机中心，去年十月涨风，以及今年年关前后，头、二、三流的投机商都已遭到了很重的打击，给了投机者很大的教训：只有正当的经营才有前途，投机者必然只有破产和毁灭。第四、广泛的零售网的设立，加强了与广大劳动人民的联系，使商人无法垄断市场。这些，就是上海今后在稳定物价上一定能克服困难，巩固胜利，获得成功的保证。
