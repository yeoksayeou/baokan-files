Guangzhou Dispatch from our Correspondent Xiao Hang: The sharp drop in salt tax revenue in Guangdong due to the serious unresolved smuggling problem has drawn the attention of the South China Financial and Economic Committee. According to a report from the Guangdong Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau, salt tax revenue for February was equivalent to 91,360 dan of rice (each dan being 100 jin), only 34% of the assigned quota. The March revenue dropped to 55,040 dan of rice, only 20% of the assigned quota. Guangzhou, the main market for the Guangdong-Guangxi salt region, originally accounted for two-fifths to three-fifths of Guangdong's total salt sales. However, in the six days from March 26 to March 31, only 13 million yuan in taxes were collected. Based on normal sales, at least 1 billion yuan should have been collected per day, totaling 6 billion yuan in six days. Compared to the actual collection, there is a difference of nearly sixty times. During the same period, no merchants went to the salt fields to acquire salt. In other towns, aside from Jiangmen, which still collected 40 million yuan in taxes per day, tax revenues in places like Shantou, Huiyang, and Baishi all plummeted, with even days of no revenue at all. Currently, the four salt fields in Hailufeng, Leizhou, Dianbai, and Shuang'en are facing difficulties due to production without sales, and the livelihood of salt farmers is very difficult, with production almost at a standstill. Originally, the Guangdong salt production quota for March was set at 395,000 dan, but the actual production was only 95,000 dan, less than a quarter of the quota.

	Lucrative Profits from Smuggling Foreign Salt; Most Train Passengers are Smugglers

The reason for the above phenomenon is primarily the serious smuggling problem, which has not been resolved in a timely manner. Guangdong salt fields were originally very scattered, making management difficult. During the Kuomintang rule, the Guangdong-Guangxi salt region had 3,000 salt police, but still, smuggled salt was everywhere. After liberation, Guangdong's seven salt fields had fewer than 400 salt police, and the Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau's directly affiliated armed force only had nine members. Furthermore, the mass work foundation in the new district is weak, some local cadres have a disregard for tax revenue, and the salt affairs work itself has some shortcomings, resulting in smuggled salt occupying the markets in southern Guangdong and the Han River basin. In addition, the Guangdong-Guangxi salt region is close to Hong Kong and Macau, and the two regions import 1.2 million dan of foreign salt annually, while the annual need is only 300,000 dan. At least 900,000 dan are smuggled into Guangdong through various methods. Because the profit from smuggling foreign salt is high, with each dan of salt earning a dan of rice, smuggling has increased. According to investigations, although the Guangzhou-Shenzhen section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bureau has repeatedly added shifts for transportation, the passengers are still abnormally crowded, and 90% of the passengers are engaged in smuggling. According to reliable estimates, with 3,000 people per day, each carrying at least 20 jin of smuggled salt, the daily amount of small-scale smuggled salt is 600 dan entering the country. If we add the large quantities of smuggled foreign salt, the amount of smuggled salt entering through the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is at least 30,000 dan per month. And the amount of foreign salt smuggled in through the Pearl River Delta waterways is twice as much as this. These two items of foreign salt smuggling and tax evasion alone cause the state to lose about 100,000 dan of rice in tax revenue each month.

	Huai Salt Sales in Southern Hunan; Guangdong Salt Sales Decrease Accordingly

Secondly, the lack of clear demarcation of sales areas and the failure to open the Southern Hunan market are also reasons for the sluggish sales of Guangdong salt. Originally, Southern Hunan was a Guangdong salt sales area, but currently, due to the lower cost and more convenient transportation conditions of Huai salt, the quantity sold in Southern Hunan is very large, and Guangdong salt sales have been greatly affected. Furthermore, the Central South Salt Industry Company issued a telegram No. 177 on March 25 to the South China branch, ordering it to "quickly abolish the Chen County (Southern Hunan salt sales base) sales office, and transfer all remaining salt to the Hunan Provincial Company for receipt." This blocked the Southern Hunan sales route for Guangdong salt and contradicted the decision made by the Central National Salt Affairs Conference that "Guangdong salt should be supplied to Guangdong and Guangxi, with the remaining salt sold to parts of Southern Hunan and Southern Jiangxi." But this issue is an internal problem of the salt affairs agencies and is easier to solve. The important issue is how to strengthen anti-smuggling work.

	Unified Management and Strengthened Anti-Smuggling Efforts Can Reduce Tax Evasion

The reason why the smuggling problem is so serious is: First, the central government approved the allocation of some armed forces to the Guangdong-Guangxi Salt Affairs Bureau as early as February, but this has not been effectively implemented. Second, the Guangdong-Guangxi salt region's organization is disrupted. Due to geographical and other conditions, the Guangdong-Guangxi salt region was originally inseparable, but after liberation, only the Guangdong Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau was established, causing the branch organizations originally belonging to the Guangdong-Guangxi salt region, such as the Wuzhou, Nanning, and Chuanbu salt bureaus, to be merged into the Guangxi Taxation Bureau, resulting in a lack of business unity. For example, Guangdong has been levying taxes on each dan of salt at 100 jin of rice since January 31, as stipulated, while Chuanbu (belonging to Yulin County) in Guangxi was still violating the regulations and only levying 50 jin of rice per dan of salt until mid-March. This only taxes smuggled salt without confiscating it. Moreover, the price of rice in Guangxi is lower than in Guangdong, so a large amount of smuggled salt flows to Guangxi, making the Guangxi border areas such as Bobai, Shahe, and Panlong notorious smuggling hotspots. When Guangdong's anti-smuggling forces arrive at the Guangxi border, the local government does not allow them to enter the country for investigation. Third, some troops use military vehicles and ships to transport large quantities of smuggled salt in southern Guangdong, near Guangzhou, and on the Guangxi border. Fourth, the Guangdong Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau makes many requests to the leadership but takes little initiative to find ways to improve its work. Currently, there are not many tax police, and many people's work morale is not high. Some even ignore smuggled salt when they see it, and some simply collude with smugglers for profit. Fifth, on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, the Salt Affairs Bureau and the Railway Bureau do not coordinate well, causing difficulties in investigation and crackdown. According to the Guangdong Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau's calculations, the daily ticket revenue is compared to tax evasion, which is equivalent to the state supporting the railway and the smugglers with the loss of tax revenue. However, recently, due to the Salt Affairs Bureau's surprise inspection for fifteen days and nights, the smuggling phenomenon on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway has been greatly reduced, and most of it has been changed to water transportation. These issues have been submitted to the relevant agencies by the Guangdong Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau to seek a quick solution and ensure the realization of the decisions made at the National Salt Affairs Conference.

　　走私漏税问题未获解决
　　广东盐税收入骤降         
　　已引起华南财经委员会注意
    【本报广州讯】特派记者萧航报道：由于严重的走私问题未获及时解决，致粤盐税收骤降，现已引起华南财经委员会注意。据广东省盐务局报告，二月份盐税收款折米九万一千三百六十担（每担一百市斤，下同），仅完成规定任务的百分之三十四，三月份收款折米降至五万五千零四十担，只及规定任务的百分之二十。通过两广盐区主要市场的广州市所销售的盐，原占粤盐总销额的五分之二到五分之三，但自三月二十六日至三十一日的六天内，仅收税款一千三百万元。如按正常销额计算，每日至少应收十亿元，六天即达六十亿元，两数相较，相差近六十倍之巨。在同一时间内，已无商人赴场配盐。其他城镇，除江门每日尚收四千万元的税款之外，余如汕头、惠阳、白石等地税收均骤减，甚至一连几天，毫无收入。现在海陆丰、雷州、电博、双恩四处盐场，因有产无销，盐民生活已十分困难，生产几乎陷于停顿。本来，三月份粤盐产量定额为三十九万五千担，实产却只有九万五千担，不及定额的四分之一。
            洋盐私销利润优厚  火车乘客大部走私
    造成上述现象的原因，首先是走私问题严重，而又未能及时解决。广东盐场原很分散，管理困难。国民党统治期间，两广盐区有盐警三千人，依然私盐遍地。解放后，广东七场的盐警，不到四百人，省盐务局的直属武装只有九名。加以新区群众工作基础薄弱，若干地方干部又有轻视税收思想，而盐务工作本身又存在某些缺点，遂致私盐占领了广东南部及韩江流域的市场。另外，两广盐区接近香港、澳门，两地每年进口洋盐一百二十万担，年需不过三十万担，至少有九十万担通过各种方法私销到广东。由于洋盐私销利大，每担盐可赚一担米，走私就越来越多。据调查，目前广九路之广（州）深（圳）段路局虽一再加班运输，而乘客仍异常拥挤，而乘客中的百分之九十以走私为业。据可靠的估计，以每日三千人，每人至少夹带私盐二十斤计算，每日零星私盐即有六百担入境。如果加上大批私携的洋盐，那么经广九路漏进的私盐，每月至少在三万担以上。而经珠江三角洲水上私漏进来的洋盐，又比这多一倍。仅仅这两项洋盐的走私漏税，国家税收每月即损失约十万担米。
            淮盐销售湘南各地  粤盐销路遂形减少
    其次，销区没有划清，湘南市场没有打开，也是粤盐滞销的原因之一。本来，湘南原为粤盐销区，目前由于淮盐成本较低，运输条件较为方便，销售于湘南者数量甚大，粤盐销路已大受影响。而中南盐业公司又于三月二十五日以盐业一七七号代电令华南分公司“速将郴县（湘南销盐据点）销售处撤销，所有存盐交给湖南省公司接收。”这样，就堵塞了粤盐的湘南销路，而与中央全国盐务会议决定的“粤盐供销广东、广西，余盐行销湘南、赣南各一部”相抵触。但这一问题是盐务机关内部的问题，较易解决。重要的问题是如何加强缉私工作。
            统一管理加强缉私  漏税现象即可减少
    走私问题之所以如此严重，乃是由于：第一，中央早于二月间批准拨交两广盐务局部分武装，而迄未切实执行。第二，两广盐区机构打乱。两广盐区因地理上等等条件，原是不可分的，解放后却仅成立了广东省盐务局，致原属两广盐区的分支机构，如梧州、南宁、船埠等地盐局，全合并于广西税务局，造成业务上的不统一现象。例如广东省自一月三十一日即按规定每担盐征税一百斤米，而广西的船埠（郁林县属）直到三月中旬，仍违章每担盐只征五十斤米。这样仅是向私盐征税，而不采取没收方法。而且广西米价较广东为低，于是大量私盐流向广西，致使桂边如博白、沙河、盘龙等地成了私盐的闹市。而广东的缉私武装到了桂边，当地政府又不让入境查缉。第三，若干部队利用军车、军船在广东南部、广州附近及广西边境大运私盐。第四，广东省盐务局向领导上要求者多，自己主动想办法改进工作者少。目前税警数目本来不多，而且不少人的工作情绪不高，甚至见了私盐也不管，有的则干脆勾结走私商谋利。第五，在广九线上，盐务局和路局配合不好，造成了查缉上的困难。据广东省盐务局计算，以每日所收票价与漏税比较，等于国家以漏税的损失来养活铁路，养活走私商人。不过，最近由于盐务局突击查缉了十五个昼夜，广九路上的走私现象已大减，多半改由水上偷运。这些问题已由广东省盐务局分别提交有关机关，以期求得迅速解决，保证全国盐务会议决定的实现。
