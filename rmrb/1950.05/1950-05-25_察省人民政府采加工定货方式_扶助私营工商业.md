　　Xinhua News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 24th: The Chahar Provincial People's Government is employing various methods to assist private industrial and commercial enterprises in overcoming current difficulties. The Zhangjiakou Municipal Labor Bureau, Industry Bureau, Commerce Bureau, Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce have formed a labor-management relations guidance committee, which is divided into six working groups. These groups are specifically tasked with understanding the situation and providing assistance within six industries, including ironworks, flour milling, silk and cloth, and general merchandise. Some of these industries have already established labor-management consultation meetings and signed temporary agreements. For example, the iron industry is currently experiencing a slow season. Labor and management in this sector have agreed that the employers will subsidize a portion of the workers' living expenses, and the workers will temporarily return to their home villages for agricultural production to reduce factory expenses. When work resumes, they will be recalled. Many workers have already returned to their villages. In addition, state-owned trading companies are also supporting private enterprises through processing and ordering methods. The Chahar Provincial Grain Company has successively signed processing contracts with 60 private flour mills in Zhangjiakou. From April 1st to May 10th, over a period of 40 days, a total of nearly 10 million jin of grain has been allocated for processing. Regarding how to assist private enterprises in overcoming difficulties and moving towards normal development in the future, the Chahar Provincial People's Government convened a meeting on the 16th of this month, gathering representatives from state-owned trade departments, banks, tax bureaus, and other units for discussion.

　　察省人民政府采加工定货方式
    扶助私营工商业
    【本报讯】据新华社张家口二十四日电：察哈尔省人民政府正以各种方法扶助私营工商业克服目前困难。张家口市政府劳动局、工业局、商业局及市总工会、市工商联合会已组成劳资关系指导委员会，分设六个工作组，到铁工、面粉及绸布、百货等六个行业中具体了解情况与帮助工作。其中已有些行业建立了劳资协商会议，签订了临时协定。如铁工业目前正值淡月，该业劳资双方已协议由资方补助劳方部分生活费，暂时回乡生产，以减轻厂内开支；以后开工时再召回复工。现不少职工已回乡生产。此外，国营贸易公司亦对私营企业用加工定货方式加以扶助。察省粮食公司已先后与张市六十家私营面粉业订立加工合同，从四月一日到五月十日四十天中，共拨出加工粮食将近一千万斤。关于今后如何协助私营企业克服困难走向正常发展的问题，察省人民政府曾于本月十六日召集国营贸易部门、银行、税局等单位举行会议商讨。
