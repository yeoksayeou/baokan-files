　　New Ballad Singing Experiments Receive Warm Welcome from Workers
    [From Our Newspaper] The All-China Railway Trade Union's Department of Culture and Education recently formed an experimental "Art Troupe," which departed on the 8th, first to various stations, sections, and factories of the Tianjin Railway to perform new ballads and screen films for railway workers, and plans to assist the Tianjin ballad singing community in establishing an "Experimental Group." After the end of May, they will work along the Pinghan, Tongpu, Yuehan (north of Hengyang), Zhedong-Jiangxi, Beijing-Shanghai, and Tianjin-Pukou lines. This Art Troupe is composed of the Tianjin Railway Administration's band, the "New Ballad Singing Experimental Mobile Group" of the China Ballad Singing Improvement Association Preparatory Committee, and the Railway Trade Union's film team. The "New Ballad Singing Mobile Group" was formed at the end of March this year, including thirteen ballad singers from Beijing, Baoding, Xinxiang, and other places. Over the past month, they have performed along the northern section of the Pinghan line at Baoding, Changxindian, Fengtai, Huangcun, Beijing, and other stations, assisting railway workers in organizing thirty-two evening gatherings and performing nine times while traveling, with a total audience of over 29,000 people (including railway workers, family members, and the masses). In Shijiazhuang, they joined the Shijiazhuang Office of the Taiyuan Railway Trade Union, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Art Work Committee, and the Xinhua Bookstore branch to assist local artists in establishing a New Ballad Singing Experimental Group, which performed for a week in Shijiazhuang and various stations and sections between Baoding and Shijiazhuang. The new ballads received a warm welcome from the workers during the performances. The Beijing Branch Committee of the Tianjin Railway Trade Union presented the "New Ballad Singing Experimental Mobile Group" with many gifts and a silk banner, and more than 230 workers signed their names in support of the spirit of the new ballad singers serving workers, peasants, and soldiers. The Fengtai Locomotive Depot Trade Union Committee also presented them with a silk banner. The artists also experienced the life of the workers in their work, raised their ideological awareness, and contributed to the improvement of ballad singing.
