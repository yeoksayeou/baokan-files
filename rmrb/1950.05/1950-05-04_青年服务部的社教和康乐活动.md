　　Youth Service Department's Social Education and Recreational Activities

    The Youth Service Department, co-sponsored by the Social Service Department of the Central Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League and the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Youth League, has been carrying out various social education and recreational art activities since its opening in mid-December last year, playing a certain role in uniting and educating the broad masses of young people. In terms of social education, the department has set up reading rooms, political study classes, Russian classes, bookkeeping classes, and held lectures on popular literature and art, popular science lectures, and popular current affairs lectures; it has also set up a question and answer desk to answer general and various specialized questions for the masses, and held exhibitions of materials such as the life of Stalin and the life of Soviet youth in conjunction with festivals. In terms of recreational and artistic activities, it opened up a game room, ice rink, and youth tea room, and set up a choir, art class, harmonica class, drama and dance groups, and organized 209 basketball games for workers, students, troops, and cadres; it held 13 weekend evenings. In addition, it established contact with 15 organs and schools in Beijing to help them carry out cultural and recreational work. The department also recruited 661 members as the basic masses of the department. In three months, through the above-mentioned various activities, tens of thousands of young people established contact with the service department, such as 26,000 readers in the reading room, 3,700 listeners in the lectures, and more than 50,000 spectators in the basketball games. More than 70,000 people participated in game room and ice rink activities. 99.6% of these people are young people, including out-of-school and unemployed youth, workers, soldiers, student cadres and citizens, of which students account for more than 75%. After planned organization and enlightenment, many people who originally only participated in recreational activities gradually became participants in lectures, political study classes, and reading rooms. Some people also participated in the work of the Youth Service Department, such as in the choir, harmonica class, and art class, undertaking the art publicity and evening performance work of the Youth Service Department, and 22 people participated in voluntary service in the game room and other places every day. Many young people inquired about joining the Youth League. Zhang Zhenchang, a small market merchant, went to the department to read books, listen to lectures and ask questions whenever he was free. He said, "The Youth Service Department is helping us to progress." After individual interviews and talks, the members who left Beijing also wrote letters to study problems. This shows that lively, vivid, diverse and extensive social education and recreational work is one of the best ways to unite and educate the broad masses of young people. The preliminary experience explored in the work in the past three months is that the activities must be diversified, must be carried out with leadership and organization, and should consciously implement a certain degree of political and ideological education. In terms of work methods, general large-scale mass activities should be combined with group activities and individual efforts; staff members must seize every work opportunity (such as borrowing books and registering) to carry out work. The future work of the Youth Service Department should more systematically cultivate out-of-school and unemployed youth, continue to carry out activities according to conditions and needs, and vigorously guide vocational education and technical education to achieve the combination of social education, cultural and recreational activities and production and construction.

　　青年服务部的社教和康乐活动
    中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会社会服务部与青年团北京市工作委员会共同举办的青年服务部，自去年十二月中旬开放以来，陆续展开各种社会教育与康乐艺术活动，对团结教育广大青年起了一定作用。在社会教育方面，该部设立了阅览室、政治学习班、俄文班、簿记班，举办了大众文艺讲座，大众科学讲座、大众时事讲座；并设立问答台，为群众解答一般和各种专门问题，配合节日，举办了斯大林生平，苏联青年生活等资料展览。康乐艺术活动方面，开辟了游艺室、溜冰场，青年茶厅，设立了合唱团、美术班、口琴班、戏剧、舞蹈小组，并组织了工人、学生、部队、干部举行篮球比赛二百零九场；举办周末晚会十三次，此外并与京市十五个机关学校建立了联系，帮助他们展开文娱工作。该部并征求部友六百六十一名，作为部的基本群众。三个月中，通过上述的各种活动，数以万计的青年群众与服务部建立了联系，如阅览室读者达二万六千人，讲座听众三千七百人，篮球比赛观众达五万人以上。参加游艺室和溜冰场活动的有七万余人。这些群众百分之九十九点六都是青年，包括失学失业青年、工人、战士、学生干部和市民，其中学生占百分之七十五以上。在经过有计划的组织与启发后，许多原来只是参加娱乐活动的群众逐渐变为讲座、政治学习班、阅览室的参加者。并有部分群众参加了青年服务部的工作，如在合唱团、口琴班、美术班，担任了青年服务部的美术宣传和晚会节目工作，游艺室等处每天有二十二人参加义务服务。许多青年询问加入青年团的问题。市场小商人张镇昌只要有空就到部里看书，听课提问题，他说：“青年服务部在帮助我们进步”。经过个别访问与谈话的部友，离京后还写信来研究问题。这都说明了通过活泼生动的多样的和广泛的社会教育和文娱工作是团结教育广大青年群众最好的方式之一。三个月来在工作中初步摸索的经验是：活动必须多样化，必须有领导、有组织地进行，并应有意识地贯彻一定程度的政治思想教育。在工作方法上，一般大型的群众活动要与小组活动、个别争取等工作相结合；工作人员必须掌握每一个工作机会（如借书、报名）进行工作。青年服务部今后的工作应更有计划地培养失学失业青年，根据条件与需要继续开展活动，大力导向职业教育，技术教育以达到社教文娱活动与生产建设结合。
