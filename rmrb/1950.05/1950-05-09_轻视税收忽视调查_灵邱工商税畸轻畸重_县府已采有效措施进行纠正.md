　　Disregarding Tax Revenue and Neglecting Investigation:
　　Lingqiu Industrial and Commercial Taxes Irregularly Light and Heavy
　　County Government Has Adopted Effective Measures to Correct It
　　[Our Newspaper News] According to a report in the Chahar Daily on April 23rd: Lingqiu neglects industrial and commercial surveys, and some cadres disregard tax revenue work, resulting in serious irregularities of light and heavy industrial and commercial taxes. For example, the total capital of merchants in Shangsai Town last year was the same as the total capital of merchants in Chengguan, but Shangsai bore 20%, while Chengguan bore only 5%. Also, due to the neglect of management of itinerant merchants, some seated merchants attempted to evade burdens and turned into itinerant merchants. For example, a cloth and cotton merchant in Xiguan transformed from a store into a father and son setting up stalls separately to evade burdens. Merchants concealed and falsely reported seriously, but the county's industrial and commercial and tax departments did not conduct inspections of merchants for a long time, and even if they found out, they did not give appropriate treatment, so that those who concealed reports took advantage and those who reported truthfully suffered. For example, Zhijianye Dyeing Shop dyed more than 300 pieces of cloth in March, but reported only 100 pieces. Although the tax bureau found out the household's serious tax evasion, it did not give any punishment. In addition, some cadres lowered their own scores in order to bear less burden. For example, Zheng Hucheng, a member of the Communist Party branch in Shangsai Town, ran a grocery store. He was not satisfied with the score given to him by the Federation of Industry and Commerce, so they lowered it for him. The most serious thing is that some county and district cadres do not understand the state's tax policy, and instead of actively publicizing and explaining the significance of taxation to the masses, they have become an obstacle to tax work. For example, when collecting slaughter tax last winter, most of the pork and mutton in the countryside did not go on the market but turned to rural transactions. Many district cadres not only did not crack down on smuggling, but also believed that this practice of the masses was "correct." District cadres in Xibaiyang Village believed that levying taxes on sulfur (factory tax) would hinder sideline production. These cadres obviously do not have a sufficient understanding of the role and importance of taxation. In view of the above situation, the county people's government held a special meeting on the 6th of this month and decided to take the following measures: (1) Strengthen the study of the "Decision on Unifying the National Financial and Economic Work" and other documents issued by the State Council of the Central People's Government by county and district cadres, and check and correct ideological deviations in connection with reality. (2) Tax cadres must adhere to principles, thoroughly conduct industrial and commercial surveys, rationally allocate burdens, overcome the phenomenon of irregularly light and heavy burdens; strengthen the management of itinerant merchants and vendors, and avoid seated merchants from becoming itinerant merchants in order to evade burdens. (3) Overcome the phenomenon of cadres not caring about and not helping tax work, pay attention to anti-smuggling work, and overcome the one-sided mass viewpoint that disregards the overall interests of the state.

　　轻视税收忽视调查
    灵邱工商税畸轻畸重
    县府已采有效措施进行纠正
    【本报讯】据四月二十三日察哈尔日报消息：灵邱忽视工商业调查，部分干部轻视税收工作，以致工商税畸轻畸重现象严重。如上塞镇去年商户总资本和城关商户总资本相同，可是上塞负担二十分，城关不过五分。又由于忽视了对行商管理，使部分座商企图逃避负担，也化为行商。如西关一布棉商，由门市部而化为父子二人分着摆摊逃避了负担。商户匿报、假报很严重，可是县工商、税务部门则长期不对商户进行检查，即便查出也不给以适当处理，使隐报者占了便宜，实报者吃了亏。如支建业染房三月份染布三百多匹，自报染一百匹，税局虽然查出了该户严重的漏税行为，但未给以任何处分。此外有的干部为了少负担，便降低自己的分数，如上塞镇中共支部委员郑虎城的杂货铺，工商联合会给他评的分，他不满意，又给他降低了。最严重的是某些县区干部，不了解国家税收政策，不但不向群众积极宣传解释税收的意义，反成了税收工作中的阻力。如去冬征收屠宰税时，农村的猪、羊肉大部都不上市而转入乡村交易，很多区干部不但不缉私，还认为群众这种做法是“正确”的。西白洋村硫磺征税（出厂税）区干部认为有碍副业生产。这些干部显然是对税收的作用与重要性认识不足。鉴于上述情况，该县人民政府于本月六日特召开会议，决定采取以下措施：（一）加强县、区干部对中央人民政府政务院颁发的统一国家财政经济工作的决定等文件的学习，并联系实际检查纠正思想偏向。（二）税务干部要坚持原则，彻底进行工商业调查，合理分配负担，克服畸轻畸重现象；加强行商、摊贩管理，避免座商化行商而逃避负担。（三）克服干部对税务工作不关心、不帮助的现象，注意缉私工作，克服片面的群众观点而不顾国家整体利益的思想。
