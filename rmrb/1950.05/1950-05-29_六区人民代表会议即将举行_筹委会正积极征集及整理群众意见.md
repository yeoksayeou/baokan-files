　　The Sixth District People's Representative Conference is About to be Held
    Preparatory Committee is Actively Soliciting and Organizing Public Opinion
    [Our Newspaper] All the representatives to the Sixth District People's Representative Conference have been elected, and the District People's Representative Conference is scheduled to be held on the 31st of this month. All members of the district preparatory committee have been working collectively at the committee since the 27th. The elected street and district representatives are widely soliciting public opinion. Yesterday (the 27th), the secretariat of the preparatory committee began to sort out these opinions, which were initially divided into twelve categories: public health, transportation roads, culture and education, cadre style, tax issues, housing disputes, public security issues, employment issues, relief issues, labor-management issues, and public-private relations. It is expected that all opinions will be sorted out within two days and submitted to the preparatory committee for discussion, and relevant parties will be convened for consultation.
    [Another News] The sixty-six street resident representatives of the Sixth District People's Representative Conference were elected on the 26th. At present, the representatives are widely collecting opinions from the masses. During the election process, the masses were very excited about the convening of the district people's representative conference. An old woman from Hebochang said with emotion: "In the past, every time the Kuomintang elected some representative, the price of millet flour would rise. Now it's different." A cobbler from Nan Dayuan joked with a policeman: "This election is really democratic. If elections were held in the Kuomintang era, the police would be eating and drinking again. Now you are earnestly working for the people." A shop assistant from a reed mat shop in Dongliushu Well said: "This time, the police station did not participate in any opinions (referring to manipulating the election). In the past, they would have broken our heads." The general public also recognized the importance of the election. Coppersmith Cui Xianwen said: "I thought for a long time before deciding to elect Liu Dehou as a representative."
    Before the election, the police station organized cadres and police officers to study relevant documents, and then convened activists and security officers among the residents to hold a meeting, and through them, they went deep into the masses to publicize. At the beginning of the election, some people were afraid that being a representative would hinder production, or were afraid of being "scolded." The comrades of the police station made detailed explanations to address these concerns of the masses. The election was able to proceed smoothly. During the election, methods such as raising hands, voting, casting beans, and drawing lines were adopted according to the opinions of the masses themselves.
    The voters voted for the people they supported based on their own understanding. In the jurisdiction of the 15th police station, some mothers and daughters, husbands and wives, voted for different candidates. Women also actively participated in this election. Many old ladies, aunts, and girls were elected as street representatives.

　　六区人民代表会议即将举行
    筹委会正积极征集及整理群众意见
    【本报讯】六区各界人民代表会议的代表已全部选出，区人民代表会议定于本月三十一日举行。该区筹备委员会全体委员，已自二十七日起，在该会集体办公。该区当选的街、区代表正广泛征求群众意见。昨（二十七日），筹委会秘书处已开始整理这些意见，初步分为：公共卫生，交通道路，文化教育，干部作风，税收问题，房屋纠纷，治安问题，职业问题，救济问题，劳资问题，公私关系等十二类。预计两日内可将所有意见整理完竣，提交筹委会讨论，并召集各有关方面进行协商。
    【又讯】六区各界人民代表会议街道居民代表六十六人，已于二十六日选出。目前各代表正广泛向群众搜集意见。在选举过程中，群众对召开区各界代表会议十分兴奋。河泊厂一个老太太感慨地说：“过去国民党每选一次什么代表，小米面就涨一次，现在可不一样了。”南大院一个皮匠跟警士开玩笑说：“这次选举真民主，如果在国民党时代办选举，警察们又该吃吃喝喝了。现在你们是认真地在为老百姓办事。”东柳树井一个席店的伙计说：“这一次派出所一点也不参加意见（指操纵选举），在过去准要打破脑袋。”并且一般市民也都认识到选举的重要，铜匠崔宪文说：“我考虑了半天，才决定选刘德厚做代表。”
    派出所于选举前，曾组织干部与警士学习有关文件，然后召集居民中的积极分子、治安员等开会，通过他们深入群众中去宣传。开始选举时，有些人还怕当了代表妨碍生产，或怕“挨骂”。派出所的同志针对群众这些顾虑，作了详细解释。选举得以顺利进行。在选举时，按照群众自己的意见采取了举手、投票、投豆、划道等方式。
    选民们都根据自己的认识，投票选举自己所拥护的人。第十五派出所辖区内，有的母女、夫妻投了不同候选人的一票。在这次选举中，妇女也积极参加了。很多老太太、大娘们、姑娘们都当选了街代表。
