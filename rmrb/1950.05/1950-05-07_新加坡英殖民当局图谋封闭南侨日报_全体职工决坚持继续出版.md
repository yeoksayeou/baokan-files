According to a Reuters dispatch from Singapore on the 2nd: All employees of the Nanyang Siang Pau have been notified that the newspaper must cease publication one month from now.

　　All the staff of the Nanyang Siang Pau have decided to argue their case on the basis of reason and insist on continuing publication. According to Reuters, a person in charge of the Nanyang Siang Pau stated that the newspaper will continue to be published, and if the government takes action to close the newspaper, the newspaper will appeal to the courts.
