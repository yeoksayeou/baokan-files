　　Reactionary Books and Periodicals Should Be Banned from Sale
　　To the Editorial Comrades:
　　There are still a few reactionary books published during the enemy and puppet regime era in the book stalls of the Dongdan Market. A soldier from my company even bought a book titled "Northeast on the Front Lines of National Defense" there, and its content is extremely reactionary. Therefore, I hope the government can strictly prohibit such reactionary books to avoid misleading readers.
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　A Reader from the First Company of the Railway Ministry Public Security Bureau Guard Regiment
　　To the Reader Comrade:
　　Your letter has been forwarded to the Beijing Municipal People's Government Press and Publication Department for a reply as follows:
　　Your opinion is very good. We are studying methods to deal with some reactionary old books published before liberation that remain in old book stalls. To do this work well, we must first obtain the help of the masses, that is, we hope that all readers will report various significantly reactionary books and periodicals; on the other hand, we also hope that colleagues in the book selling industry in this city (including bookstores and book stalls) will voluntarily report and voluntarily stop selling various significantly reactionary books and periodicals published before liberation.

　　反动书刊应禁止贩卖编辑同志：
    东单市场书摊现尚有少数敌伪时代出版的反动书籍。我连一个战士便曾在那里购回一本《国防前线的东北》，内容非常反动。因此，对于这种反动书籍，希望政府能严加查禁，以免贻害读者。
                               铁道部公安局警卫一连一读者一读者同志：
    来信经我们转请北京市人民政府新闻出版处答复如下：
    你的意见很好。对于旧书摊所残留的一些解放前所出版的反动旧书，我们正在研究处理的办法。为了作好这一工作，首先就要取得群众的帮助，即希望所有的读者检举各种显著反动的书刊；另方面我们也希望本市图书贩卖业（包括书店与书摊）的同人自动加以检举，自动停止发售解放前所出版的各种显著反动的书刊。
