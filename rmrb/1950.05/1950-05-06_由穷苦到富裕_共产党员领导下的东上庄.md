　　From Poverty to Wealth
    Communist Party Members' Leadership in Dongshang Village
    Wen Miao
    The masses of Dongshang Village, Anyang County, Pingyuan Province, have composed a song themselves, narrating their past poor life and the current improvement of life. They often sing:
    "Blasted crops, yellow and withered,
    Children crying with hunger,
    Eating coarse chaff then tree leaves,
    Eating, eating, then running out of everything.
    Mothers weeping, fathers clapping hands,
    Alas! We grab our walking sticks and flee the famine,
    The landlord's dog eats shiny food,
    We poor people are not even as good as that dog.
    Blasted crops, smiling brightly,
    We have turned over and have good times.
    Party members lead us to engage in production,
    The grain we harvest is inexhaustible;
    We have enough to eat and drink and buy cattle,
    People and wealth are both thriving and rising.
    Fathers laugh, sweating,
    Sisters laugh, spinning around,
    Brothers laugh, grinning widely,
    Sisters-in-law laugh, blushing;
    Thanks to the Party members for leading us,
    Otherwise, how could we have this day?
    …"
    As long as you walk into Dongshang Village, no matter who you talk to, he will tell you: "If it weren't for the good leadership of our village's Party members, we wouldn't be in such a good situation. To be honest, they are really good household managers!" Originally, Dongshang Village was a village surrounded by mountains and ridges with a lot of wasteland. Locust plagues occurred constantly in the past, and every spring there was not enough food to eat. However, last year, the village's fifteen Party members led the masses to actively reclaim wasteland, catch locusts, and accumulate fertilizer, launching a major production campaign. As a result, the whole village had a bumper harvest. This spring, not only did the masses in the whole village not lack food, but they also bought fifty-seven additional livestock, and the lives of the masses have also improved initially.
    How did the branch members of Dongshang Village lead the production so well? Li Huayuan, the branch secretary of this village, said: "This is not an easy thing to do! Take last year's locust control as an example. At the beginning, the masses not only did not fight them, but also opposed it! They all said: 'Those are divine insects, you can't fight them! Whoever fights them will be unlucky...' Our branch held a meeting, and I said: 'Let our Party members fight first, set an example for the masses to see.' Everyone fought for a morning, and most of the locusts in more than one mu of land were gone. At this time, we mobilized again, and some of the masses still didn't believe it, and some of the masses followed to fight. The more people fighting locusts, the greater the results. Slowly, everyone went to fight, and the locusts were quickly wiped out. When the flying locusts laid locust nymphs, the masses were willing to fight, and in a few days, they eliminated seven hundred catties and dug up one hundred and thirty catties of locust eggs. The crops were not harmed by the locusts, and the fertilizer was applied more, and the hoeing was diligent, and the corn grew like cow horns. At this time, the masses no longer believed that the locusts were divine insects. 'Reclaiming wasteland is also like this. At the beginning, the masses said: 'It's a waste of effort and you can't harvest anything!' They didn't go to reclaim, so our Party members reclaimed on their own, and at the same time, divided the work and mobilized, mobilizing one person today, and two people tomorrow, and slowly they all went to reclaim. Last year, they reclaimed two hundred mu, and the crops planted also harvested well, and the masses were very happy." The branch members of Dongshang Village influenced the masses with their own exemplary actions and patiently persuaded and educated the masses, did a good job in production, and won the support of the people of the whole village.
    At the beginning of this year, Branch Secretary Li Huayuan and all the Party members held a meeting to review the leadership of production last year. Everyone agreed that last year's achievements were not small, but there were still many shortcomings. For example, in mobilizing the masses to fight locusts, there were still coercive orders for individual people, the mutual aid organization was not very good, and they only paid attention to mobilizing the masses to hoe more cotton and corn, neglecting to hoe more beans and millet, especially not mobilizing the masses to plant trees. Everyone also studied how to lead the masses this year and make the time better. The Party members all proposed that the trees in the whole village have been destroyed by the Japanese devils and Chiang Kai-shek for more than ten years. This year, we must mobilize the masses to plant more trees and turn this bare village into a green forest and orchard, and the plowing and fertilization should be doubled before the War of Resistance. The land in the village is suitable for growing cotton, and the higher authorities have called for growing more cotton. We must mobilize the masses to plant all the spring white land with cotton. After the meeting, the Party members went to the masses in different areas to carry out propaganda. At meal times, when it was dark, every Party member seized the time to talk to the masses: "One mu of cotton is equal to three mu of farmland; to get rich, grow cotton... Accumulating manure is like accumulating gold... Plow the land twice, and harvest half more..." They did not hold a single villagers' meeting, but the masses' enthusiasm for production was even greater.
    When spring plowing began, the Party members had already launched a production competition among the masses. Young people and adults, women and men, this household and that household, all put forward the conditions for the competition: "See who accumulates the most fertilizer, see who plants the most trees, see whose family harvests the most grain this year, see who does the most work..." At the same time, the Party members and the masses of the whole village jointly formulated a production plan: 1. The whole village has 810 mu of spring white land, planting 710 mu of cotton, and another 100 mu of cotton in wheat fields; when planting, be sure to soak the seeds in warm water and mix them with ash. Apply 45 loads of manure per mu of cotton land to ensure eight hoeings. 2. Plow all the spring land twice and harrow it five times. 3. Hoe the millet four times and apply 45 loads of manure. 4. Hoe the beans three times and apply four loads of manure. 5. Ensure that each person plants and survives at least three trees in the spring. 6. Harrow the wheat twice and hoe it three times. 7. Each person reclaims three cents of wasteland this year. 8. Check the fields for pests at any time, and extinguish them immediately when found. Then, the women of the whole village made a plan: make all the single clothes and lined clothes for the whole year before the Qingming Festival. After the Qingming Festival, fully participate in field work. After each household made a plan, the Party members led the action.
    On April 5th, the branch and all the Party members issued a challenge to Cheng Baifu, a special-class labor hero of Pingyuan Province, with the production plan of the village plus the Party members' guarantee to contact the masses in production, take the lead in completing tasks, and absolutely not to coerce orders, and requested to start a production competition with Comrade Cheng Baifu. When the challenge letter and Cheng Baifu's response were published in the Pingyuan Daily, the masses of Dongshang Village immediately caused a sensation and expressed: "Resolutely support this challenge plan and resolutely complete this plan under the leadership of the Party!" The masses also challenged each other in the middle. The Party members also became more clear about contacting the masses: in the future, they should listen to the opinions of the masses more humbly and help the masses solve production difficulties. The branch's opinions on production must be submitted to the People's Congress, the village government, the Women's Congress, and the Youth League for discussion, and resolutions should be formulated and implemented jointly. After a thorough rain on April 15th, the branch immediately held a meeting to discuss and make a resolution: each Party member, under the leadership of the village government, should set an example, contact the masses freely at night to solve the difficulties of seeds, tools, and labor, and assist the village cadres and representatives to check the cotton planting preparations of each household, and lead the masses to soak seeds, mix seeds, and promptly attack planting. After the meeting, the village branch secretary submitted the branch's opinions to the People's Congress for discussion and approval, and the village government arranged for the masses, and the masses of the whole village quickly took action. Soaking seeds, mixing seeds, and helping each other prepare seeds and tools formed a craze. The next day, the whole village freely organized 35 temporary mutual aid groups of men and women. From the afternoon of the 16th to the evening of the 18th, in two and a half days, the whole village planted 900 mu of cotton, exceeding the original plan of planting 810 mu of cotton. In planting cotton, the masses unanimously proposed to the village branch and Party members: "In the future, you boldly lead everyone forward! We will follow closely behind and lead our Dongshang Village to prosperity." After planting, the branch held a meeting in a timely manner. At the meeting, Branch Secretary Li Huayuan said: "We may not be able to say every word into the hearts of the masses! In the future, we can establish a research production team, listen to the reflections of the masses, carefully study according to the instructions of the higher authorities, and then submit the opinions to the People's Congress for research and form a resolution, and we should resolutely implement it."

　　由穷苦到富裕
    共产党员领导下的东上庄
    文渺
    平原省安阳县东上庄的群众自己编了一支歌，叙说过去的贫苦生活及现在的生活改善情形。他们经常地唱着：
    “脱掌花，黄巴巴，
    小孩饿的吱哇哇，
    吃完粗糠吃树叶，
    吃着吃着断顿啦。
    娘吊泪，爹拍手，
    唉！拉起来拐棍逃荒走，
    地主家黄狗吃的毛发明，
    咱穷人就不如那只狗。
    脱掌花，笑盈盈，
    翻身来了好光景。
    党员们领咱闹生产，
    打的粮食吃不清；
    有吃有喝又买牛，
    人财两旺朝上升。
    爹爹笑的出汗汗，
    妹妹笑的打转转，
    哥哥笑的光咧嘴，
    嫂嫂笑的红了脸；
    多亏党员们领导咱，
    要不那有这一天？
    ……”
    你只要走进东上庄，不管和任何一个农民谈起来，他都会这样告诉你：“要没有俺村党员的好领导呀，到不了这好地步。说老实话，他们真是好受家哩！”原来东上庄是一个山岭群绕荒地较多的村子，过去不断发生蝗灾，每年春天粮食都不够吃。但是，去年村里十五个党员领导群众积极开荒、捕蝗、积肥，开展了大生产运动，因而全村喜获丰收，今春全村群众不但不缺粮，还添买了五十七头牲口，群众生活也有了初步改善。
    东上庄的支部党员，是怎么把生产领导好的呢？这村的支部书记李华元说：“这可不是个好做的事儿哩！就比如去年打蝗虫吧，一开头，群众不光不打，还反对哩！都说：‘那是神虫呀，可打不的！谁打谁得倒霉……’俺们支部开了会，我说：‘咱党员先打去，做个样子叫群众看看。’大家打了一上午，一亩多地里的大部蝗虫没有啦。这时候又发动，有的群众还不信，有的群众跟着打去了。打蝗虫的人一多，成绩更大啦。慢慢的就都去打了，很快把蝗虫都消灭啦。打下飞蝗又出蝗蝻时，群众都愿意打了，没几天就消灭了七百斤，还刨蝗卵一百三十斤。庄稼没受蝗虫害，上的粪又多，锄的又勤，玉茭长的像牛角样，这时群众才不信蝗虫是神虫啦。开荒也是这样，起头群众都说：“白费力气收不了啥！’不去开，我们党员就一面自己开，一面分工发动，今天发动一个，明天发动两个，慢慢的都去开了。去年开了二百亩，种上庄稼收的也挺好，群众可高兴啦。”东上庄的支部党员，就是这样地以自己的模范行动影响群众，并耐心地说服教育群众，搞好了生产，获得了全村人民的拥护。
    今年一开春，支部书记李华元就和全体党员一起开了会，对去年领导生产作了检讨，大家一致认为：去年的成绩是不小的，可是，还有不少缺点。例如在发动群众打蝗中，对个别的人，还有强迫命令，互助组织的不很好，只注意了发动群众多锄棉花、玉茭，忽略了多锄豆子和谷子，特别是没有发动群众栽树等。对今年如何领导群众，把时光过的更好，大家也作了研究。党员都提出：全村的树木，十几年来，被日本鬼子，蒋介石给毁坏光了，今年一定要发动群众多栽树，把这个现在光巴巴的村子，变成个绿油油的树林和果树园，犁耙地和上粪要超过抗战前一倍。村里的土地都适合种棉花，上级号召多种棉，咱要发动群众，把春白地全部种成棉花。会后党员们便分片向群众进行了宣传。在吃饭的时候，在天黑了的时候，每个党员都抓紧给群众谈：“一亩棉，三亩田；要发家，种棉花……积粪如积金……地犁两遍，多收一半………”他们一次村民大会也没开，可是，群众生产的劲头都更大了。
    当春耕开始的时候，党员们已在群众中发动了生产竞赛。青年和壮年，妇女和男子，这户和那户，都提出了比赛的条件：“看谁积的肥多，看谁栽的树多，看谁家今年打的粮食多，看谁干活干的多……”同时，党员和全村群众，共同订出了一个生产计划：一，全村有春白地八百一十亩，种棉花七百一十亩，麦地里再种棉花一百亩；种时一定温汤浸种，用灰拌种。每亩棉地上粪四十五担，保证锄八遍。二，春地全犁两遍，耙五遍。三，谷子锄四遍，上粪四十五担。四，豆子锄三遍，上粪四担。五，保证春天每人最少栽活三棵树。六，麦子耙两遍，锄三遍。七，每人今年开荒三分。八，随时检查地里有没有害虫，发现马上扑灭。接着，全村妇女又订出计划：清明节前把全年的单衣，夹衣做好。清明节后，完全参加地里活。家家户户订出计划之后，党员们便领导着行动起来了。
    四月五日支部和全体党员，以本村的生产计划加上党员在生产中保证联系群众，带头完成任务，绝对不发生强迫命令现象为条件，向平原省特等劳动英雄成百福发出挑战书，要求和成百福同志展开生产竞赛。当挑战书和成百福的应战答复在平原日报上发表后，东上庄的群众马上轰动起来，纷纷表示：“坚决拥护这个挑战计划，坚决在党的领导下完成这个计划！”群众中间也相互提出挑战竞赛。党员中对联系群众方面也更明确了：今后应更虚心听取群众意见，帮助群众解决生产困难。支部对生产的意见，则一定提交人代会、村政府、妇代会、青年团讨论后，制订决议共同执行。四月十五日下过透雨后，支部马上开会讨论，作出决议：每个党员在村政府领导下，以身作则，连夜串通群众自由碰组，解决种子、工具、劳力困难，协同村干部和代表检查各家种棉准备，带领群众浸种、拌种，及时突击下种。会后，村支书将支部意见提交人代会讨论通过，村政府向群众布置，全村群众很快行动了起来。浸种、拌种，互助准备种子工具形成了热潮。第二天，全村即自由组织了三十五个男女临时互助组，从十六日下午至十八日晚，两天半时间，全村种棉九百亩，超过了原来植棉八百一十亩的计划。在植棉中，群众一致向村支部、党员提出：“往后，您大胆的带着大家走吧！俺紧紧的在后边跟着，把咱东上庄走到富富裕裕的地步。”下种罢，支部又及时开了会，在会上支书李华元说：“咱们可不一定每句话都说到群众心眼里呀！今后咱们可成立个研究生产的小组，听到群众反映，根据上级指示，加以细心研究，再把意见提交人代会研究，形成决议，咱应坚决执行。”
