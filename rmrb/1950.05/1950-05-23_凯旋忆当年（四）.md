Mother, consumed by anger and anxiety,
Fell ill and couldn't rise from her bed;
Poor little sister, with no one to care for her,
Required selling thirty catties of corn.
Where could we voice our grievances?
The yamen only catered to the wealthy;
The village chief was also a big landlord,
Related to Skinflint Sun by a winding path.
Before my wound had healed enough to walk,
A lackey policeman came knocking!
Waving the village chief's banner,
To drag me, a stranger, off to do forced labor.
From then on, my leg wound festered into a sore,
My disability a constant source of resentment;
The landlord is my mortal enemy,
Far from home, my hatred is hard to bear.
On "September 18th," the Japanese devils occupied the Northeast,
Chiang the traitor didn't resist;
Through fourteen years of near-death experiences,
The taste of being a subjugated slave was heartbreaking. (Attached picture)

    凯旋忆当年（四）
    西虹词  西野画
    妈妈气的心火烧，
    一病在地难起身；
    可怜妹妹无人养，
    包米卖了三十斤。
    心中冤苦那里伸？
    衙门朝着有钱人；
    村长也是大地主，
    他跟孙剥皮拐弯亲。
    不待伤好能下地，
    狗腿警察来敲门！
    打着村长的大旗子，
    抓我外乡出劳工。
    从此腿伤烂成疮，
    残疾在身恨不平；
    地主是我死对头，
    离家千里恨难伸。
    “九一八”日寇占东北，
    蒋贼卖国不抵抗；
    九死一生十四年，
    亡国奴滋味苦断肠。（附图片）
