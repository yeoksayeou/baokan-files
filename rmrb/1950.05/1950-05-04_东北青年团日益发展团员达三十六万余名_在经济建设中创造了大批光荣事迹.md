Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 3rd: The work of the New Democratic Youth League in the Northeast region is developing rapidly. According to incomplete statistics from March, the existing membership has reached 365,116, of which 27.7 percent are distributed in rural areas; 23.2 percent in industrial and mining and railway departments; 22.3 percent in schools; and 16 percent in government agencies. The quality of the members has generally improved compared to the past, and a large number of outstanding members have joined the Communist Party. In Harbin alone, 1,063 members joined the Communist Party, accounting for more than 7 percent of the city's total membership.

As early as July 1948, the First Northeast Youth Work Conference defined the direction of the Northeast Youth League to serve economic construction. The Second Youth Work Conference held in September 1949 decided on specific measures for carrying out the innovation record movement and the study of technology and culture by young workers. At the same time, the Chinese Communist Party specifically guided and helped the Youth League organizations to carry out their work, so that the work of the League could closely revolve around the central tasks of the People's Government and the Party at each stage. Therefore, Youth League members in various factories, mines, and railways in the Northeast actively participated in emulation drives, voluntary work, anti-waste campaigns, elimination of accidents, and rationalization proposals. Especially in the innovation record movement, they played a pioneering role. Zhao Guoyou, the famous banner of innovation records, is a Youth League member. Among the 2,700 new records that emerged in state-owned and public factories in Liaodong Province, Youth League members created 410 new records, and 338 members received awards. Dou Yubin, a member of the Harbin Woolen Mill, pioneered the record of weaving 45.75 yards of cloth in nine hours. Bi Yulan, a female member of the "May 3rd" factory in Shenyang, was the factory's first new record creator and received the title of "Heroine." Simultaneously with the new record movement, Youth League members also promoted a surge in technology learning. Many factories and mines carried out the movement to respect teachers and love apprentices, and signed master-apprentice contracts, which improved the technical level of young workers. Among the 1,823 apprentices trained by the Dalian-Changchun Railway Factory, 1,083 were promoted. With the expansion of the economic construction upsurge, some female Youth League members, such as Liang Jun, Tian Guiying, and Qi Guizhi, mastered new technologies and became tractor drivers, train drivers, and lathe workers, creating glorious achievements for working women in the new China.

Rural Youth League members are not only the backbone of production mutual aid teams, but also participate in supply and marketing cooperatives, sideline production, preferential treatment for military families, winter schools, and grain delivery with exemplary actions, becoming strong assistants to the Communist Party and the People's Government. Ninety-two percent of rural Youth League members in Jingxing County, Heilongjiang Province, participated in mutual aid teams; 17 percent of rural Youth League members in Dunhua County, Jilin Province, served as leaders of production mutual aid teams; Guo Yulan, a model female Youth League member in Heilongjiang Province, not only actively participated in labor herself but also organized women's production in her village; Liu Guiqin, a female Youth League member in Liaoxi Province, organized women to weave baskets, which promoted the sideline production of the entire village and was elected as a labor model in the province.

After transitioning to regularized learning, school Youth Leagues completed regular course studies and organized various extracurricular activities around the regular courses. League members' academic performance was generally excellent. League members have made many creations in promoting practical teaching, learning assistance, improving teacher-student relations, establishing laboratories, and making specimens and instruments. During the winter vacation, Youth Leagues in various places universally organized winter vacation schools, labor teams, etc., and assisted in publicizing the sale of public bonds, and helped carry out various cultural and educational activities in factories, mines, and rural areas. Some deviations occurred in the execution of these tasks by the Youth League, such as too many extracurricular activities in some schools, or isolated cultural and educational work after arriving at factories, which were promptly corrected by Youth League committees at all levels.

Youth League members in government agencies have also achieved many successes by focusing on the central tasks of ensuring the completion of administrative tasks, studying their professions, observing rules, and enlivening agency life. Mao Hongyu, a member of the Taxation Bureau of Liaoxi Province, increased the number of bills reviewed from 500 to 1,800 per day during reorganization, saving more than two people in manpower; Dong Lianchun, a female member of the Fushun Post and Telecommunications Bureau's exchange, reduced the registration time for telephone calls from the prescribed 15 seconds to 10 seconds, and the inquiry time from the prescribed 10 seconds to 4 seconds. She only made three minor errors in a year and was rated as a model for telecommunications workers in the Northeast.

　　东北青年团日益发展团员达三十六万余名
    在经济建设中创造了大批光荣事迹
    【新华社沈阳三日电】东北地区新民主主义青年团的工作日益发展。据三月份不完全统计，现有团员已达三十六万五千一百一十六名，其中分布在农村者占百分之二十七点七；工矿、铁路部门占百分之二十三点二；学校占百分之二十二点三；机关占百分之十六。团员质量一般均已较前提高，大批优秀团员参加了共产党。仅在哈尔滨市即有团员一千零六十三名加入了共产党，约占该市全体团员总数的百分之七以上。
    早在一九四八年七月东北第一次青年工作会议就确定了东北青年团为经济建设服务的方针。一九四九年九月召开的第二次青年工作会议，对开展创新纪录运动、青年工人学习技术和文化等问题又都决定了具体办法。同时中国共产党具体地指导和帮助了青年团的组织进行工作，使团的工作能紧紧围绕着人民政府和党在每一时期的中心任务。所以，在东北各工矿、铁路中的团员都积极地参加了立功竞赛、义务献工、反浪费、消灭事故、合理化建议等运动。尤其是在创造新纪录运动中，更发挥了先锋作用。著名的创造新纪录的旗帜赵国有就是青年团员。辽东省国营公营各工厂所涌现的二千七百件新纪录中，青年团员创造新纪录即有四百一十件，受奖团员达三百三十八名。哈市毛织厂团员窦玉斌首创九小时织布四十五点七五码的纪录；沈市“五三”工厂女团员毕玉兰为该厂第一个新纪录创造者，得到了“女英雄”的称号。与新纪录运动同时，青年团员还推动了学习技术热潮，许多厂矿开展了尊师爱徒运动，并纷纷订立师徒合同，使青工技术水平获得提高。旅大中长铁路工厂在培养的一千八百二十三名徒工中，有一千零八十三名获得升级。随着经济建设热潮的扩展，有些女团员如梁军、田桂英、戚桂芝等，掌握了新的技术，成了拖拉机手、火车司机和旋床工人，为新中国的劳动妇女创造了光荣的事迹。
    农村的青年团员不仅是生产互助组中的骨干，并以模范行动参加了供销合作社、副业生产、优待军属、冬学、送公粮等工作，成为共产党和人民政府的有力助手。黑龙江省景星县农村团员中有百分之九十二参加了互助组；吉林省敦化县有百分之十七的农村团员当了生产互助小组长；黑龙江省模范女团员郭玉兰不仅自己积极劳动，而且是本村妇女生产的组织者；辽西省女团员刘桂琴组织妇女编筐，推动了全村的副业生产，被选为该省的劳动模范。
    学校青年团在转入正规化学习后，完成了正课学习，并围绕正课组织了各种课外活动。团员学习成绩均较优良。在推动实例教学、学习互助、改进师生关系、建立实验室、制造标本仪器等工作上，团员都有很多创造。寒假期中，各地青年团普遍组织了寒假学园、劳动队等，并协助进行推销公债的宣传，到各工矿、农村帮助进行各种文教活动。青年团在执行这些任务中发生了一些偏向，如有的学校课外活动太多，有的到了工厂后孤立搞文教工作等，都经各级团委及时纠正。
    机关中的青年团员则以保证完成行政任务、钻研业务、遵守制度、活跃机关生活等为中心任务，亦获得不少成绩。辽西省税局团员毛宏余，在整编中审核票照由每天五百张提高到一千八百张，节省了两个多人力；抚顺市邮电局交换台女团员董莲春登记电话由每次规定的十五秒减到十秒，查号由规定十秒减到四秒，一年中仅有三次微小差错，被评为东北电务工作者模范。
