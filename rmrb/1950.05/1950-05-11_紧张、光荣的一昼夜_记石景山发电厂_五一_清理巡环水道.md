　　A Tense and Glorious Day and Night
　  Record of the Shihchingshan Power Plant’s “May Day” Cleaning of the Circulation Waterway
    Our Correspondent Xia Baoyi
    The Shihchingshan Power Plant has been in operation for over thirty years. The circulation waterway from the water pumps to the generators has never been cleaned. Because of the excessive accumulation of mud in the waterway, the efficiency and lifespan of the vapor cylinders, as well as the load on the generators, have been seriously affected. This waterway is ninety-five meters long, over two meters wide, and more than four meters deep. Cleaning it during normal times would require a complete power outage at the plant, which would affect the lives of the people in the capital. This time, the cleaning was carried out as a concentrated effort during the "May Day" holiday, taking advantage of the factory closures and vacations to stop power generation (with a small amount of electricity for the city supplied by power plants in Tianjin, Tangshan, etc.).

    Before starting, the factory management committee first conducted thorough research. The factory's Party branch, trade union, and the Communist Youth League concentrated their efforts on preparation and arrangements. Liu Lao Yingxiong (Plant Director Liu Yingyuan) called on everyone, saying, "We must produce our own achievements to celebrate 'May Day,' and turn this ditch that hasn't been cleaned in over thirty years completely around in our hands!..." Upon hearing the director's call, the workers eagerly signed up to participate in the glorious "May Day" voluntary labor.

    At six o'clock in the afternoon on April 30th, the tense work began. The first step was to block the waterway's gate. It was raining heavily at the time, and the wind was particularly cold. Some workers took off their clothes and jumped into the waterway, which was more than four feet deep, to block the gate with earth-filled sacks. The current was very swift, and after the workers had managed to block one row of sacks, they were washed away by the water. The water was very cold. Everyone worked for a while, ran to the bathhouse to warm up a little, and then ran back to work. It wasn't until after two o'clock in the morning that the two water gates were finally blocked. After blocking the gates, they started installing water pumps and connecting pipes to prepare for pumping out the water. Electrical workers installed electric lights in the cave. Everyone's movements were tense and rapid. At four o'clock, the workers on the night shift began digging mud.

    People were divided into two rows in the waterway: one row carried baskets of mud out, and the other row passed the empty baskets back. At the cave entrance, a pulley was used to pull them up. The people working in the cave stood in water that was more than a foot deep to dig mud. This work was very strenuous. The mud was very sticky. It was difficult to dig up, even when stomping hard with their feet on the iron shovel head. Some used so much force that they even broke the iron shovel handle. After standing in the mud for a long time, their legs would sink in, and they couldn't pull them out. Comrade Wang Zimian, the Party branch secretary, had his foot sink in and barely managed to pull it out, but his shoe was left behind. But none of the workers were afraid of difficulties, and everyone worked tensely. The people in the machine room carried and hauled non-stop, dumping the mud outside. It was still raining outside, and everyone carrying mud looked like mud men.

    At eight o'clock in the morning, the teachers and students of the factory's primary school also came to participate in the mud-carrying work. Some female comrades had never done such heavy work before, but they carried the earth baskets with no hesitation. When the primary school students got tired, they picked up paper megaphones and broadcast to the various cave entrances, announcing the work achievements of each group and encouraging everyone's work enthusiasm.

    Quick reports were posted all over the machine room, saying: "The rainy day is cold, the cave is cold, but the work enthusiasm is fiery red," "Keep it up! Keep it up! Make the clay roll!"

    For lunch, the administration prepared four ounces of meat, five eggs, and three large steamed buns for each participant. Director Liu's speech further boosted everyone's enthusiasm. At noon, including lunch and rest, they only stopped for half an hour, and then continued to work with even greater vigor. The original five hundred baskets were not enough. In the morning, one basket was pulled up at a time. In the afternoon, some pulled up two or three baskets at a time. The mud diggers and mud carriers started a competition: the mud diggers always wanted to outpace the mud carriers, and the mud carriers never allowed mud baskets to accumulate.

    Party branch secretary Wang Zimian dug mud in the cave from three o'clock at night until three-thirty in the afternoon. All four members of the Party branch committee insisted on working like this. Engineers Tang Xixin and Li Shouqi also worked for a day and a night.

    The cleaning of the waterway was completed at four o'clock in the afternoon on "May Day," and power was restored at five o'clock.

    A total of an average of one hundred cubic meters of mud was dug out, which increased the water capacity of the waterway by one hundred cubic meters. In the past, due to the excessive accumulation of mud in the waterway and the reduced water capacity, the water temperature was high in summer, and the generator could not carry its rated load. Now, with the increased water surface, the generator can reach its original rated load. Before the mud was dug out, large amounts of mud mixed into the vapor cylinders, reducing their efficiency and lifespan. After digging the mud, this situation was changed. During the Kuomintang rule, due to the corruption and incompetence of the management, many screws, wooden blocks, mechanical parts, stones, and other debris fell into the waterway, causing frequent damage to the water pumps; this time, everything inside was completely cleared out, and the lifespan of the water pumps was also extended.

　　紧张、光荣的一昼夜
　  记石景山发电厂“五一”清理巡环水道
    本报通讯员　夏宝义
    石景山发电厂开办三十多年了。从水泵到发电机的巡环水道，一直都没有清理过。因为水道积泥过多，对化汽缸的效率和寿命，及发电机的负荷都发生了严重的影响。这条水道有九十五米长、二米多宽、四米多深。在平时要进行清理，必需全厂停电，这就要影响首都人民的生活。这一次清理是利用了“五一”节各工厂停工休假的机会，停止发电（市民少量用电由天津、唐山等发电厂供给），突击进行的。
    动工以前，工厂管理委员会首先作了周密的研究，工厂党支部工会和青年团各方面都集中力量进行准备和布置。刘老英雄（厂长刘英源）向大家号召说：“我们要拿出自己的成绩来庆祝‘五一’，要让三十多年没有清理过的水沟在咱们手里翻个身！……”职工们听到厂长的号召，都争着报名，参加光荣的“五一”义务劳动。
    四月三十日下午六点钟，紧张的工作开始了。首先是堵死水道闸口，当时正下着大雨，风也刮的特别凉。一些工友脱掉衣服，跳下四尺多深的水道，用装着土的麻袋堵闸口。水流很急，工友们好容易堵好一排麻袋，又被水冲倒了。水是很冷的。大家工作一阵，跑到澡堂稍微暖暖身子，就又跑回来干，直到夜里两点多钟，才把两个水闸口堵好。堵完水口，接着就装水泵，接管子，准备抽水。电气工友在洞里装电灯。大家的动作紧张而迅速。四点钟，夜班的工友们就开始挖泥了。
    人们在水道里分成两行：一行把一筐筐的泥土送出去；一行把空筐传回来。到洞口有滑车往上拉。在洞里工作的人们，站在尺多深的水里挖泥。这工作很吃力。泥粘的很。用脚努力把铁铣头踩下去，却很难掘上来。有的用劲过大，连铁铣把都折断了。人们在泥上站的工夫大了，双腿就会陷下去，拔都拔不出来。总支书记王自勉同志的脚陷下去了，好容易才拔上来，鞋子却丢在里边了。但是工友们谁也不怕困难，一个个在紧张地工作着。机械房里的人们抬的抬、挑的挑，不停地往外面倒泥。外面还在下着雨，抬泥的人一个个都像泥人一样了。
    早晨八点，本厂小学校的教员和学生，也来参加抬泥工作。有些女同志从来也没干过这样的重活，可是她们抬起土筐来满不含糊。小学生抬累了，拿起纸喇叭到各洞口去广播，告诉各组的工作成绩，鼓动大家的工作情绪。
    快报贴满了机械房，上面写着：“下雨天凉洞里冷，工作情绪火般红”，“加油！加油！要叫胶泥滚球！”
    午饭，由行政上给每位参加劳动的人们准备了四两肉、五个鸡蛋、三个大馒头。刘厂长向大家讲话，更鼓舞了大家的热情。中午连吃饭加休息，只停了半个钟头，大家就紧接着干，而且劲头更大了。原有的五百个筐也不够用了。上午往上拉泥，一回拉一筐。下午有的就拉二筐、三筐。抬泥的和掘泥的人们比赛起来了：掘泥的总想把抬泥的压下去，而抬泥的总不让泥筐存下。
    党总支书记王自勉从夜里三点钟在洞里挖泥，直干到下午三点半。党总支四个总支委都是这样坚持工作的。工程师汤希新、李寿祺等都是干了一天一宵。
    清理水沟的工作在“五一”下午四点钟完毕，五点钟开始送电。
    这次共挖了平均一百立方米的泥土，这就使水沟增加了一百立方米的水度。过去因水沟积泥过多，水度减少，夏季水温高，发电机带不到定额的负荷。现在因水面增加，发电机可达到原定的负荷了。没有挖泥的时候，泥土大批的混到化汽缸里，减低了化汽缸的效率和寿命。挖泥以后，这种情形得到改变。在国民党统治时候，因管理人员腐败无能，致使水沟里落下很多螺丝、木块、机械零件、石头等杂物，水泵因而常受损伤；这次把里面的东西完全清检出来，水泵寿命也延长了。
