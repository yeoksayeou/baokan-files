The Ma Hengchang production group of the Fifth Machine Factory of the Northeast Machinery Bureau completed its production plan ahead of schedule every month from April of last year to February of this year, and was able to guarantee that the product quality met the standards. Of the ten workers in the group, eight did not produce a single piece of defective work throughout the year. From May to November of last year, the group manufactured more than 7,000 precision products. In September of last year, the group completed two months' worth of tasks in one month. In the new record creation movement, seven workers in the group created ten outstanding new records. They have successively won collective award flags from the Fifth Machine Factory, the Shenyang Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Northeast Industry Department. All workers in the group have been commended. All of the original ten workers have now become glorious Communist Party members and have been trained and promoted to become worker cadres.

The group has many valuable experiences in production, learning, and unity, which are worthy of learning by workers in various factories.

　　I. Created a set of methods to ensure product quality: (1) Established a technical research association. After the production task is assigned to the group, the group leader leads all workers to study the drawings and precautions in the work, and respectively formulate individual production plans. The implementation of this method not only ensures the completion of the production task, reduces defective work, improves quality, but also improves the technical level of the workers and strengthens the unity and mutual assistance between the entire group. For example, Ma Hongru, with the help of everyone, improved from making a spiral washing shaft in one and a half hours to making one in fifteen minutes, and the quality met the specifications. (2) Check the first piece first. After the first piece is made, it is checked by the entire group or the inspection team. If it meets the specifications, continue to do it; if it does not meet the specifications, immediately study the reasons and improve the working methods. In this way, the waste of producing a large number of defective products can be eliminated. (3) Carry out strict criticism and self-criticism. If someone produces defective work, they must consciously review the reasons at the noon meeting and everyone will help him to study and improve methods.

　　II. Specific division of labor and establishment of a responsibility system. Since May of last year, the group has assigned production, learning, security, sanitation, entertainment, and other tasks to each person according to their specialties, and the group leader Ma Hengchang has grasped the overall situation and is responsible for solving technical problems. Due to the clear responsibilities and the cooperation of everyone, the various tasks of the group can be completed smoothly step by step. In order to strengthen the connection between shifts, the group has established a shift handover system. The day and night shifts take over at 5:00 p.m. every day. The night shift arrives ten minutes early to the shift to listen to the day shift workers' report on the machine and work conditions; when the night shift hands over to the day shift, because they cannot implement face-to-face handover, they write a note on the lathe. Particularly important matters are explained in person the next morning. When doing new work, the day and night shift workers first study together before starting work.

　　III. Patiently help workers and actively train apprentices. When each new worker first arrives at the Ma Hengchang group, the old workers enthusiastically tell them about the performance and operation methods of the machine, and actively and promptly help them solve difficulties. This makes the new workers feel confident when working and learn quickly. The old workers actively train apprentices. After three months of study, six apprentices have been able to work independently.

　　马恒昌小组介绍
    东北机械局第五机器厂马恒昌生产小组，从去年四月至今年二月每月都是提前完成生产计划，并能保证产品质量合乎规格。全组十名工友中，有八名全年未出一件废活。从去年五月至十一月，该组共制造七千余件精密产品。去年九月份，该组以一个月的时间，完成了两个月的任务。在创造新纪录运动中，该组有七名工友创造了十件出色的新纪录。先后荣获第五机器厂、沈阳市总工会、东北工业部三面集体奖旗。全组工友都立了功。原来的十名工友，现已全部成为光荣的共产党员，并被培养提拔为工人干部。
    该组在生产、学习、团结等方面，有许多宝贵经验，值得各厂工友学习。
    一、造创了一套保证产品质量的办法：（一）成立技术研究会。当生产任务分配到小组后，即由组长领导全体工友，研究图纸及工作中应注意事项，并分别订出个人的生产计划。实行这个办法后，不仅能保证完成生产任务，减少废活，提高质量，而且提高了工友的技术水平，加强了全组彼此间的团结互助。该组如马洪儒在大家帮助之下，由过去一小时半做一个螺旋洗轴，提高为十五分钟做一个，且质量合乎规格。（二）先检查头一个活。每逢作出头一个活以后，即由全组或检查股进行检查。如合乎规格，就继续做；如不合乎规格，马上就研究原因，改进工作方法。这样，就可消灭产生大批废活的浪费现象。（三）开展严格的批评与自我批评。某人如制造出废活，一定要自觉地在中午开会时检讨原因，大家帮助他研究改进办法。
    二、具体分工，建立责任制。从去年五月起，该组即将生产、学习、保安、卫生、娱乐等工作，按每人特长，分别负责一项，组长马恒昌掌握全面，并负责解决技术上的问题。由于责任明确，大家分工合作，该组各项工作，都能按步就班地顺利完成。为了加强班与班之间的联系，该组建立了交班制，每天下午五点钟，日夜两班接班。夜班提前十分钟到班，听取日班工友关于机器与工作情况的报告；夜班交日班时，因不能实行见面交班，就写一张纸条放在车床上，特别重要的事情，在第二天早上当面交待。做新活时，由日夜两班工友首先在一起共同研究，然后才开始工作。
    三、耐心帮助工友，积极培养徒工。每个新工友初到马恒昌小组时，老工友都很热心地告诉他们机器的性能与操作方法，主动及时地帮助他们解决困难。使新工友作活时心里有底，学习进步很快。老工友对徒工是积极培养，经三个月的学习，已有六名徒工能单独干活了。
