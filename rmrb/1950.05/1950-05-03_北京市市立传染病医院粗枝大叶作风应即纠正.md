　　The Careless Work Style of the Beijing Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital Should Be Corrected Immediately
To the Editor:
　　On the 17th of this month, my child had a severe cough. My family took him to the Beijing Municipal Infectious Disease Hospital on East Xida Street for treatment. The doctor examined him, took a blood sample from under his ear, and told my family, "It's diphtheria. Giving him a special injection might cause a reaction. It's better to hospitalize him to take care of him." At that time, he gave my family a guarantee and a consent form each. When they came back, we were very anxious. On the one hand, we tried to raise money, and on the other hand, to be cautious, we decided to take the child to Peking University Hospital and get an emergency number for another check. After Peking University Hospital used general examination and bacterial culture methods, it proved that he had no diphtheria bacteria. The matter has been going on for a week, and although the child's cough has not yet subsided, it is absolutely certain that he does not have diphtheria.
　　We strongly suspect the attending doctor at the Infectious Disease Hospital. How did he examine my child? What did he base his diagnosis of diphtheria on? If we had completely believed his diagnosis, we would not only have spent a lot of money unnecessarily, but also would have made an even bigger mistake. We hope that the leading cadres of the hospital will quickly investigate this careless and sloppy work style!

### 北京市市立传染病医院粗枝大叶作风应即纠正

　　北京市市立传染病医院粗枝大叶作风应即纠正编辑同志：
    本月十七日我的孩子咳嗽得很厉害，家人领他到东城西大街北京市市立传染病医院就诊。该院大夫将他检查并由耳下取血检验后，告诉我的家人说：“是白喉，打特效针恐怕有反应，住院好照顾他。”当时他并交给我的家人保证书及志愿书各一张。回来后，我们都很感着急，一方面设法筹款，一方面为了慎重起见，决定将孩子领往北大医院，挂急诊号再查一次。经北大医院用一般检查及培养细菌办法证明他却并无白喉细菌。事情至今已经一个星期，孩子的咳嗽虽然还没好，但是所患的并非白喉症却是千真万确了。
    我们很怀疑传染病医院的主治大夫，对于我的孩子是怎样检查的？根据什么诊断他所患的为白喉？假如我们完全信了他的诊断，便不但要化费许多冤枉钱，而且恐怕要铸成更大的错误了。希望该院领导干部对于这种粗枝大叶马虎作风，赶快加以检查！
