    [From Our Newspaper] The comedy "Not a Cicada," created by worker Wei Lianzhen, is scheduled to officially premiere at the Beijing Youth Palace on the 15th.

Everyone unanimously agreed that the play was vivid, lively, simple, and honest, showcasing the bright and straightforward character and authentically joyful life of the working class. It demonstrated the genius of the working class in artistic creation. Therefore, various parties strongly advocated that the play be officially premiered in Beijing. At the same time, regarding some shortcomings in the play's writing and performance, the Shijiazhuang City Cultural Troupe is currently revising and re-staging the play under the guidance of renowned playwright Hong Shen, while striving to retain the original author's intention and taking into account opinions from all parties.
