Xinhua News Agency, May 1st dispatch from Paris: The French cabinet decided at a meeting on April 28th to dismiss the world-renowned scientist and peace fighter, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, from his position as High Commissioner for Atomic Energy. Joliot-Curie was appointed as the French High Commissioner for Atomic Energy on January 4, 1946, for a five-year term. This reactionary act by the French government has aroused widespread indignation among peace-loving people around the world. The Standing Committee of the World Peace Council has issued a special communiqué condemning this hostile act against peace by the Bidault government. Thirteen senior officials of the French Atomic Energy Commission issued a joint protest on the evening of the 28th, opposing the government's dismissal of Joliot-Curie because he is a communist. They expressed their complete trust in Joliot-Curie.
According to a commentary by democratic figures in Paris cited by Electric News Agency, this despicable action by the French ruling class demonstrates their subservience to their American masters. Because Professor Joliot-Curie's courageous stance in upholding peace has long been seen by American atomic maniacs as a thorn in the side of warmongers. Therefore, the French puppet government obediently replaced Joliot-Curie, immediately earning the praise of its American masters. According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington on April 28th, American congressional figures expressed "glee" over the dismissal of Professor Joliot-Curie, believing that they could strengthen "cooperation" with France on atomic energy matters in the future. Agence France-Presse also reported on the same day that American officials did not conceal their "satisfaction" and indicated that the French government, after dismissing Joliot-Curie, should also "be careful not to allow communists to hold any senior positions in administrative departments or the military."

Xinhua News Agency, May 1st dispatch from Moscow: The Secretariat of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress in Paris issued the following communiqué: "The Secretariat of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress has learned that the French Cabinet has decided to remove Nobel Prize winner Professor Joliot-Curie – member of the French Academy and Chairman of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress – from his positions as High Commissioner for Atomic Energy and member of the Atomic Energy Commission.

Joliot-Curie was one of the initiators of the appeal passed by the Stockholm meeting of the World Peace Council Standing Committee in March 1950, which called for the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and considered the first government to use atomic weapons a war criminal. Joliot-Curie was the first person to sign this appeal.

This action to remove Joliot-Curie from his position is completely contrary to the appeal of the Stockholm meeting of the World Peace Council. In the eyes of all men and women in all countries fighting for peace, this is a blatant infringement on the cause of peace and an act of submission to the enemies of world peace."

### 法反动政府解除居里职务和大发表公告抗议  指出这是对和平敌人的屈膝行动

　　法反动政府解除居里职务和大发表公告抗议
    指出这是对和平敌人的屈膝行动
    【新华社一日讯】据法新社巴黎消息：法国内阁于四月二十八日会议决定解除世界杰出的科学家与和平战士约里奥——居里原子能高级专员的职务。约里奥——居里系于一九四六年一月四日被任为法国原子能高级专员，任期应为五年。法国政府这一反动的行为，已引起全世界和平人士的普遍愤慨。世界和大常委会特发表公报，谴责皮杜尔政府这一敌视和平的行动。法国原子能委员会十三个高级官员二十八日晚发出共同抗议，反对政府因约里奥——居里是共产党员而予免职。他们表示对约里奥——居里完全信任。
    据电通社引巴黎民主人士的评论认为，法国统治阶级这一卑劣的行动，表现了他们对美国主子的卑躬屈膝。因为约里奥——居里教授拥护和平的勇敢立场，早就被美国原子狂患者看成是战争制造者们的眼中钉。因此，法国奴才政府卑顺地撤换约里奥——居里的职务，立刻得到了它的美国主子的称赞。据路透社华盛顿四月二十八日电称，美国国会方面人士对约里奥——居里教授的免职，表示“庆幸”，并认为今后在原子能事务上可与法国加强“合作”。法新社同日报道亦称：美国官方人士并不掩盖他们的“满意”，并示意法政府在将居里免职后，还要“注意不让共产党员在行政部门或军队中担任任何高级职位。”
    【新华社一日讯】塔斯社巴黎四月二十九日讯：世界拥护和平大会常设委员会书记处顷发表下列公报：“世界拥护和平大会常设委员会书记处顷得悉，法国内阁已决定免除诺贝尔奖金得奖者约里奥——居里教授——法兰西学院院士及世界拥护和平大会常设委员会主席——的原子能高级专员及原子能委员会委员的职务。
    约里奥——居里是世界和大常委会斯德哥尔摩会议在一九五○年三月通过的呼吁书的发起人之一，该呼吁书要求无条件禁止原子武器，并认为第一个使用原子武器的政府是战争罪犯。约里奥——居里是在这个呼吁书上签字的第一人。
    免除约里奥——居里职务这一行动，是完全与和大常委会斯德哥尔摩会议的呼吁相背驰的。在各国一切为争取和平而斗争的男女看来，这是公开地侵害和平事业，并且是对世界和平的敌人的屈膝行动。”
