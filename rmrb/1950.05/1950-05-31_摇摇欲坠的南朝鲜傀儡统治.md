　　The Crumbling Puppet Rule in South Korea
　　Liu Guiliang
　　Having suffered a complete defeat in its plan to plunder China, American imperialism has not learned its lesson and is now repeating its shameful failure in South Korea.
　　As the influence of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front in South Korea continues to expand, the people's armed struggle develops rapidly, peasant uprisings spread like wildfire in various regions, and the puppet National Defense Army constantly revolts, the traitorous Lee Seung-man clique supported by American imperialism is increasingly isolated, and its reactionary rule is on the verge of collapse.
　　At the end of last October, the Lee Seung-man puppet government convened an "Emergency Bandit Suppression Conference" in Daejeon, Chungcheongnam-do, deciding to change its strategic policy of "Northward Expedition First," and revived the old tune of Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang of " pacifying the interior first, then resisting foreign aggression." It formulated a "Winter Suppression Plan," dividing South Korea into five regions, using five divisions of the puppet "National Defense Army" (Lee Seung-man has a total of eight divisions), about 60,000 troops, plus 30,000 to 40,000 police and secret agents, to carry out "encirclement and suppression," clamoring to completely eliminate the guerrillas within the first three months of this year, and then launch a "Northward Expedition." The five regions are: 1. Yeongnam Region: the border area between Gyeongsangbuk-do and Gyeongsangnam-do; 2. Honam Region: the area around Jeollabuk-do and Jeollanam-do; 3. Jirisan Region: the border area between Gyeongsangnam-do and Jeollabuk-do; 4. Taebaeksan Region: the border area between Gyeongsangbuk-do and Gangwon-do; 5. Central Region: the border area between Chungcheongbuk-do and Gyeongsangbuk-do. "Suppression Headquarters" were established in Daegu, Gwangju, Hamyang, Andong, and Yeongju respectively, and the "General Headquarters" was located in Daejeon.
　　After the meeting, a fierce "sweep" was launched. From the beginning of December last year to now, it has successively carried out key "suppression" operations in the Honam Region, Jirisan Region, Yeongnam Region, and Taebaeksan Region, and dispatched air force to carry out indiscriminate bombing. The so-called "US Military Advisory Group" leader Roberts, together with the puppet "Defense Minister" Shin Sung-mo, went to Daejeon, Andong, Gyeongju and other places to deploy and plan. After Roberts went to Tokyo in early February to meet with MacArthur and the US Chiefs of Staff and returned to South Korea, he openly led the puppet army police "suppression team" to directly command operations.
　　At the same time, the illegal "United Nations Commission on Korea" also continued to go to the front line to "inspect," and recently decided to establish a "military monitoring group" to help the Korean traitors massacre patriotic people.
　　However, the heroic people's guerrillas, with the support of the broad masses of peasants, waged an unyielding struggle against the puppet army with flexible tactics, and repeatedly inflicted heavy blows on the invading puppet army. In the four months from November last year to February this year, the guerrillas annihilated as many as 4,737 puppet troops and police. The US-Lee's "suppression plan" will never be realized.
　　The Lee Seung-man puppet government used the Japanese invaders' "Three Alls Policy" and "scorched earth tactics" in the guerrilla areas, burning villages and massacring innocent residents, turning vast rural areas into ruins and leaving millions of peasants homeless. Recently, it was decided to transport a large number of refugees to the Philippines and South American countries as immigrants. In the Jirisan area, the puppet army "Suppression Headquarters" ordered a curfew, and residents were not allowed to go beyond 100 meters from their own houses. Anyone deemed to be connected to the guerrillas was brutally murdered.
　　US Military Advisory Group "Police Advisor" Beate established so-called "Special Police Teams" and "Police Schools" in Daegu, Busan, and other places, training a large number of armed secret agents to carry out massacres.
　　According to the statistics of the Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland United Democratic Front, from 1945 to 1949, Lee Seung-man massacred more than 149,000 patriotic people in four years, and in the second half of last year alone (after the establishment of the Fatherland Front), he massacred more than 62,000 people.
　　However, bloody suppression is powerless to stifle the people's resistance. The national flag of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been hung on the "Presidential Palace" in Seoul several times. More than 40,000 peasants revolted in November last year alone. Unless the US-Lee regime kills all 17 million South Korean people, the underground anger will erupt sooner or later.
　　The puppet government's military "suppression" and bloody repression are all for the same purpose—to prepare the rear for launching a civil war in order to realize its traitorous policy of turning South Korea completely into a colony of US imperialism and a strategic base for aggression against the Asian continent.
　　Lee Seung-man actually colluded again with the enemy of the Korean people—the Japanese reactionaries—and shouted the hackneyed tune of "Korean-Japanese friendship" again.
　　On February 16, Lee Seung-man, together with puppet "Foreign Minister" Lim Byeong-jik, "Army Chief of Staff" Chung Il-kwon, and others, went to Tokyo and met with MacArthur, Yoshida, Sato (Speaker of the House of Councillors), Bihara (Speaker of the House of Representatives), Ikeda (Finance Minister), and MacArthur Headquarters Deputy Chief of Staff Fox. The central issues discussed were: concluding a secret military agreement and strengthening Korean-Japanese trade.
　　After returning to Seoul from Tokyo, Lee Seung-man took a series of measures for "Korean-Japanese friendship."
　　The so-called "Civilian Trade Mission" led by Oh Jeong-su, former Minister of Commerce of the US military government, and the "Purchasing Delegation" led by Kim Woo-pyeong, the current Director of the Foreign Investment Purchasing Office, went to Japan in early March, and held a Korean-Japanese trade preparatory meeting in Tokyo on March 6 to draft a new trade agreement (trade volume of 80 million US dollars) to replace the old agreement (signed in April 1949), which expired at the end of March. South Korea will supply Japan with 200,000 tons of rice this year in exchange for Japanese weapons and military supplies.
　　Under MacArthur's direction, Lee Seung-man decided to set up a "Military Attaché Department in Japan" and a branch of the Bank of Korea in Tokyo. Korea and Japan will also send news reporters to each other and have direct telephone lines. The so-called "Guanfu Liaison Station" (regular shipping from Shimonoseki, Japan, to Busan, Korea), which was once the springboard for Japanese imperialism's invasion of Korea, has also been decided to be restored.
　　South Korea has been included by US imperialism in its line of aggression in the West Pacific. Today, the people who actually rule South Korea are Muccio (US Ambassador to Seoul), Barrows (Director of the US Economic Cooperation Administration's "Korea" branch), Roberts (Leader of the US Military Advisory Group), Beate (Police Advisor), Lando (Air Force Advisor), and other American colonialists. At the end of June last year, under the pressure of the entire Korean people, US imperialism announced its withdrawal of troops, stating that it would only leave a 500-member "Military Advisory Group," but in reality, every company in the South Korean puppet "National Defense Army" has US "advisors." One wonders how many "500s" there are.
　　In the military field, in addition to the "Korean-US Provisional Military Agreement" signed on August 24, 1948, and the "Korean-US Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement" signed on January 26 this year, Lee Seung-man secretly discussed with MacArthur's representatives in Jinhae, South Korea, in November last year to use Jeju Island as a US naval and air force base. On January 14 this year, a "Korean-US Gimpo Airport Agreement" was also established, selling the management rights of Gimpo Airport, the largest airport in South Korea, to the United States, and through the co-opting of the American rogue Chennault, the South Korean air force base was provided for use by Chiang Kai-shek's remnant bandit gang to bomb the Chinese mainland. The recent secret Korean-Japanese military agreement was also concocted under the direction of US imperialism.
　　In the economic field, the "Korean-US Agreement on the Transfer of Property and Finance" and the "Korean-US Economic Mutual Assistance Agreement" signed on August 24, 1948, are comparable to Chiang Kai-shek's "Sino-US Treaty of Commerce." American soldiers have become big landlords in South Korea, and 94 percent of the industry is in the hands of American monopoly capitalists.
　　According to the 1950 Korean Central Yearbook, as of the second half of 1949 (first half of this year), the cumulative total of military and economic "aid" given by US imperialism to Lee Seung-man has reached more than 730 million US dollars. However, what is the actual state of the South Korean economy under the "aid" of US imperialism? The number of factories in 1949 has decreased to 36 percent of that in 1943, the cultivated land area has been reduced to 55 percent of that in 1946, the price level has risen a thousand times compared with 1946, and the number of unemployed people has exceeded 3 million.
　　The awakened Korean people have fully realized what the so-called "US aid" means to them. Since 6 billion US dollars could not save Chiang Kai-shek, can 700 million US dollars save Lee Seung-man?

　　摇摇欲坠的南朝鲜傀儡统治
    刘桂梁
    美帝国主义在对中国的掠夺计划遭到彻底破产后，并没有得到足够的教训，目前它正在南朝鲜走着可耻失败的复辙。
    由于朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线在南朝鲜的影响愈来愈扩大，人民武装斗争迅速地发展，农民起义运动在各地区如火如荼地展开，伪国防军不断起义，使美帝国主义所支持的李承晚卖国集团日益陷于孤立，反动统治摇摇欲坠。
    去年十月末，李承晚傀儡政府在忠清南道的大田市召开了“紧急剿匪会议”，决定改变“北伐第一”的战略方针，弹起蒋介石匪帮“先安内后攘外”的旧调，制订了“冬季讨伐计划”，将南朝鲜分成五个地区，以伪“国防军”五个师团（李承晚共有八个师团）约六万人的兵力，加上三、四万警察和特务，进行“围剿”，叫嚣在今年的头三个月内完全消灭游击队，然后“北伐”。五个地区是：一、岭南地区：庆尚南北道交界地带；二、湖南地区：全罗南北道一带；三、智异山地区：庆尚南道与全罗北道交界地带；四、太白山地区：庆尚北道与江原道交界地带；五、中部地区：忠清北道与庆尚北道交界地带。五个地区分别在大邱、光州、咸阳、安东、荣州设立了“讨伐司令部”，“总司令部”设于大田。
    会后即发动了凶狠的“扫荡”。从去年十二月初到现在，先后向湖南地区、智异山地区、岭南地区、太白山地区进行重点“讨伐”，并出动空军滥施轰炸。所谓“美军事顾问团”团长罗柏兹曾与伪“国防长官”申性模一起到大田、安东、庆州等地部署、策划。二月初罗伯兹赴东京与麦克阿瑟及美参谋首长们会谈后回到南朝鲜，竟公然率领伪军警“讨伐队”直接指挥作战了。
    与此同时，非法的“联合国朝鲜委员会”也不断地到前线去“视察”，最近并决定成立“军事监视组”，帮助朝鲜卖国贼屠杀爱国人民。
    但是，英勇的人民游击队，在广大农民的支援下，以灵活的战术与伪军进行了不屈不挠的斗争，并屡次予进犯的伪军以重大打击，在从去年十一月到今年二月的四个月中，游击队共歼灭伪军警达四千七百三十七名之多。美李的“讨伐计划”是永远无法实现的。
    李承晚傀儡政府对游击区袭用日寇的“三光政策”和“焦土战术”，烧毁村庄，屠杀无辜居民，使广大的农村尽成废墟，数百万农民流离失所。最近并决定将大批难民运往菲律宾及南美各国做移民。在智异山地区，伪军“讨伐司令部”下令戒严，居民不得走出自己的房舍百米以外。凡被认为与游击队有联系者，皆横遭杀害。
    美军事顾问团“警察顾问”比厄特在大邱、釜山等地设立所谓“特别警察队”和“警察学校”，训练大批武装特务进行屠杀。
    据朝鲜祖国统一民主主义战线中央委员会的统计，从一九四五年到一九四九年的四年中，李承晚一共屠杀了爱国人民十四万九千余名，仅在去年下半年（祖国战线成立之后），就屠杀了六万二千多人。
    然而，血腥的镇压是无力窒息人民的反抗的。汉城“总统府”好几次挂上了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的国旗，只去年十一月一个月内就有四万余农民起义，除非美李将一千七百万南朝鲜人民全部杀光，地下的怒火迟早会爆发出来。
    傀儡政府的军事“讨伐”与血腥镇压都是为了同一目的——为发动内战准备后方，以实现其使南朝鲜完全变成美帝国主义的殖民地与侵略亚洲大陆的战略基地的卖国政策。
    李承晚竟与朝鲜人民的死敌——日本反动派重新勾结，又喊起“韩日亲善”的滥调来了。
    二月十六日，李承晚偕伪“外务长官”林炳稷、“陆军参谋长”丁一权等赴东京，先后与麦克阿瑟、吉田、佐滕（参院议长）、币原（众院议长）、池田（财政部长）及麦克阿瑟总部副参谋长福克斯等会晤。商谈的中心问题是：缔结秘密军事协定和加强韩日通商。
    李承晚从东京回到汉城后，采取了一连串“韩日亲善”的措施。
    由前美军政府商务部长吴桢洙率领的所谓“民间贸易团”和现任外资购买处处长金佑枰所领导的“购买使节团”三月初赴日，三月六日在东京举行了韩日通商预备会议，起草新的通商协定（贸易额八千万美元），以代替三月末期满的旧协定（一九四九年四月签订）。南朝鲜今年将以二十万吨大米供应日本，换取日本的武器和军需品。
    在麦克阿瑟指使下，李承晚决定在东京设“驻日武官部”和朝鲜银行分行。韩日并互派新闻记者，直通电话。而当年日本帝国主义侵略朝鲜的跳板——所谓“关釜联络站”（日本下关到朝鲜釜山的定期航运）也决定恢复。
    南朝鲜已被美帝国主义列入其西太平洋的侵略线。今天，实际统治南朝鲜的人是缪锡俄（美国驻汉城大使）、班兹（美经合总署“韩国”分署署长）、罗伯兹（美军事顾问团团长）、比厄特（警察顾问）、蓝度（空军顾问）等美国殖民者。去年六月末，在全朝鲜人民压力下，美帝国主义虽宣布撤兵，声明只留下一个五百人的“军事顾问团”，但实际上南朝鲜伪“国防军”中每个连里都有美军“顾问”，不知道要有几个“五百人”。
    在军事方面，除了一九四八年八月二十四日签订的“韩美临时军事协定”和今年一月二十六日签订的“韩美联防互助协定”之外，去年十一月间李承晚已与麦克阿瑟代表在南朝鲜的镇海密议以济州岛作美海空军基地，今年一月十四日还成立了一个“韩美金浦机场协定”，把南朝鲜最大的金浦机场经营权卖给美国，并通过美国流氓陈纳德的拉拢，将南朝鲜空军基地供蒋介石残余匪帮使用，以轰炸中国大陆。最近的韩日秘密军事协定也是在美帝国主义导演下搞出来的。
    在经济方面，一九四八年八月二十四日签订的“韩美关于移让财产及财政的协定”和“韩美经济互助协定”，堪与蒋介石的“中美商约”媲美。美国军人成了南朝鲜的大地主，百分之九十四的产业握在美国独占资本家手中。
    据一九五○年朝鲜中央年鉴统计，截至一九四九年下半年度（今年上半年），美帝国主义给予李承晚的军事和经济“援助”累计总额已达七亿三千万美元以上。然而，在美帝国主义“援助”下的南朝鲜经济实况是怎样的呢？一九四九年的工厂数目已减少到一九四三年的百分之三十六，耕地面积缩减到一九四六年的百分之五十五，物价比一九四六年上涨了一千倍；失业人数已超过三百万。
    觉悟了的朝鲜人民已经充分地认识到：所谓“美援”，对他们究竟意味着什么。既然六十亿美元不能挽救蒋介石，难道七亿美元就挽救得了李承晚吗？
