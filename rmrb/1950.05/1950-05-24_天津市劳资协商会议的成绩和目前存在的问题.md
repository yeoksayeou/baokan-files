　　Achievements and Existing Problems of the Tianjin Labor-Capital Negotiation Conference
　　By Tianjin Daily Reporter Liu Xin

　　Under the principle of "developing production, benefiting both labor and capital," private industrial and commercial enterprises in Tianjin have successively established labor-capital consultation organizations since November of last year. As of now, over 70 factories and stores, including Hengyuan, Beiyang Yarn Factory, Yongli Alkali Plant, Jiuda Company, Kailuan Coal Mine, China Department Store, Qianxiangyi Silk Store, and Longshunrong Pharmacy, have established such organizations (factories account for two-thirds of the total). Their forms include labor-capital negotiation conferences, factory management committees, production committees, production planning committees, and more than ten other types.

　　Generally, these organizations are established under the following three circumstances: First, the factory's production and sales are relatively normal, and both labor and capital have a good understanding of the policies. To further improve production and business, they are established after discussion and agreement between labor and capital, such as in the case of Tianchang Machinery Factory and Daxin Textile Dyeing Company. Second, to improve labor-capital relations, resolve long-standing major issues between labor and capital, and on this basis, labor and capital jointly improve production, such as in the case of Beiyang Yarn Factory. Third, many factories and stores are organized to overcome the temporary difficulties in product sales and operations, such as Huichang Iron Factory, Lizhong Acid Plant, and China Department Store. However, regardless of the circumstances or the form in which these organizations are established, they have achieved initial results, bringing the labor-capital relationship in Tianjin into a new stage.

　　Firstly, through the labor-capital negotiation conference, some factories have launched production and economy drives, red flag competitions, and movements to care for machinery and save raw materials, under the principle of benefiting both labor and capital. Some workers in factories and stores, to assist the capitalists in overcoming current difficulties, have voluntarily signed temporary agreements with the capitalists to reduce wages or living standards. As a result of this active production and overcoming difficulties, the production outlook of various factories has been completely renewed, and the business conditions of general factories and stores have gradually improved. For example, since the launch of the red flag movement, the output of Beiyang and Hengyuan Yarn Factories has increased month by month. Beiyang's daily yarn output in March increased by 4.7% compared to February, and April increased by 8.9% compared to March. Hengyuan Yarn Factory's positive cloth rate reached 98.7% in April, setting an unprecedented record for the factory. In terms of improving quality and saving raw materials, Changcheng Rubber Factory, after patient research and improvement by its employees, reduced the waste edge rate of rubber shoe soles by 50%, resulting in a significant improvement in quality. Since Nanyang Rubber Factory changed to the method of rolling rubber by weight, it has saved about one-tenth of its raw materials. In terms of assisting capitalists in overcoming difficulties and maintaining production, employees of units such as Jiuda, Yongli, Guoguang Rubber Factory, Guanghua Paper Mill, and Ruifuxiang Silk Store have appropriately reduced wages or living standards. This great spirit of self-denial and high political consciousness of the working class has deeply moved the capitalists and encouraged their confidence in management. Many factory capitalists have automatically expressed their willingness to abandon their negative plans to "reduce salaries, lay off people, and shrink operations" (such as Huichang Iron Factory, Changcheng Rubber Factory, etc.). At the same time, due to the normalization of labor-capital relations and the improvement of production in some factories, employee welfare has also been gradually improved. After Hengyuan Yarn Factory stipulated temporary labor protection regulations and hired a female doctor, labor conditions and the physical health of employees were effectively guaranteed. Beiyang, Dasheng, Renli, Dongya, and Nanyang Rubber Factories have either built worker canteens and bathhouses, or added spittoons and hot water buckets in the workshops, or cleaned up the lighting and toilets.

　　Secondly, through the labor-capital negotiation conference, some old and unreasonable management systems and business methods in various factories and stores have begun to change, and a new system of scientific and democratic management has been gradually established. For example, Beiyang, Hengyuan, and Dasheng three major yarn factories announced the abolition of the body search system shortly after the establishment of the labor-capital negotiation conference, and successively established systems for attendance, rewards and punishments, and inspection. The Beiyang Yarn Factory's negotiation conference, after studying the production of the factory's reeling workshop, implemented a new working method to further improve production and quality; and the labor and capital of Hengyuan Yarn Factory, in order to strengthen the connection between the negotiation conference and the workshop workers and to solve the problems in the workshop in a timely manner, established a bridge organization between the negotiation conference and the masses of workers - the workshop production conference. To ensure the smooth development of the red flag competition, the negotiation conference also passed temporary labor protection regulations. Lizhong Acid Plant also implemented a periodic quota system based on the factory's production situation. New factory management rules and reward and punishment methods, and labor discipline are also being drafted. In the stores, China Department Store, Zhenghua Silk Store, and others have also changed their outdated business policies and methods. This change in management system and business policy has not only effectively improved labor-capital relations and improved production and business conditions, but also laid a good foundation for further implementation of democratic management and overcoming current difficulties, maintaining and developing production and business. However, there are still many problems in the current general labor-capital negotiation organizations:

　　First, in the process of establishing labor-capital negotiation organizations, the relevant departments lack specific guidance; and both labor and capital lack a clear and unified understanding of this organization. Some capitalists have the view of simply using the labor side to overcome current temporary difficulties, or hold a skeptical and tentative attitude; some labor sides are simply for solving labor protection and welfare issues. Therefore, the organizational forms are complex, the names are numerous, and the content is disorganized. Sometimes the number of representatives of both sides is large or small, and it is not fixed. At the same time, due to the limitations of the organizational form, the negotiation content of many factories and stores is limited to simple discussion and formulation of production plans (such as the "Production Planning Committee"), while important issues related to improving production management, business, and employee treatment are rarely negotiated. This loses the practical significance of the labor-capital negotiation conference. Therefore, it is necessary to unify and improve these organizations with inconsistent forms and numerous names based on the spirit of the Ministry of Labor of the Central People's Government's instruction on "establishing labor-capital negotiation conferences in private industrial and commercial enterprises," combined with the actual situation in various factories and stores, so that the Tianjin Labor-Capital Negotiation Conference can achieve further soundness and consolidation on the existing basis.

　　Second, some labor and capital in some factories and stores, due to insufficient understanding of the significance and role of the labor-capital negotiation conference, have caused two deviations in the current organization: On the one hand, some capitalists lack sincerity in solving problems through negotiation under the principle of benefiting both labor and capital in improving production, and try to "use" the trade union to control workers everywhere, or emphasize that workers reduce wages and living standards under the pretext of overcoming difficulties and overcoming difficulties, in order to achieve the purpose of benefiting the capital side; on the other hand, some labor representatives, at the negotiation conference, use the pretext of "mass opinion" and "democratic resolution" to force the other party to accept and implement their opinions, and some even interfere with the administrative management rights and personnel allocation systems of the capital side. These are not in line with the basic spirit of the labor-capital negotiation conference and need to be corrected urgently.

　　Third, the current general labor-capital negotiation organizations in factories and stores have not yet been truly brought into the right track. This is not only reflected in the organizational form, but also in the lack of a regular meeting system, clear meeting content, and a certain negotiation procedure. Some labor and capital in factories and stores do not regard this organization as the best organizational form for improving business and improving production (especially at present, it is an important guarantee for overcoming difficulties and overcoming difficulties), but regard it as a temporary organization, the meeting is not sound, and no preparation is made in advance, so it cannot solve problems better. At the same time, the chairmen of some negotiation conferences are not alternately held by labor and capital under the principle of equal consultation, but are mostly held by the capital side. These are all issues worth studying and solving.

　　天津市劳资协商会议的成绩和目前存在的问题
    天津日报记者  柳心
    在“发展生产，劳资两利”的原则下，津市私营工商企业中，自去年十一月间，即相继建立劳资协商机构，截至目前止，已有恒源、北洋纱厂、永利碱厂、久大公司、开滦煤矿及中华百货售品所、谦祥益绸缎庄、隆顺榕药店等七十余工厂、商店已建立了该项组织（工厂占其总数的三分之二）。其形式包括劳资协商会议、工厂管理委员会、生产委员会、生产计划委员会等十余种。
    按此种组织一般的是在以下三种情况下建立起来的：一、厂内产销情况比较正常，劳资双方也都比较了解政策，为进一步搞好生产，改进业务，经劳资双方商讨并同意之后而建立起来的。如天昌机器厂、大新织染公司等。二、为改善劳资关系，解决劳资间久未解决的重要问题，并在此基础上，劳资协力搞好生产。如北洋纱厂等。三、许多工厂、商店，为克服目前产品销路与经营中的暂时困难而组织起来的。如汇昌铁工厂、利中酸厂和中华百货售品所等。但不论在何种情况下或以何种形式建立起来的此种组织，都已获得了初步的成绩，使本市劳资关系开始步入新阶段。
    首先，通过劳资协商会议，在劳资两利的原则下，有些工厂展开了生产节约，红旗竞赛，与爱护机器节省原料等生产运动；有些工厂、商店的工人，为协助资方克服目前困难，则主动与资方签订临时协定，降低薪资或生活水平。这种积极生产与克服困难的结果，使各厂的生产面貌焕然一新，一般工厂和商店的营业情况亦逐日好转，如北洋、恒源纱厂自开展红旗运动后，产量逐月上升。北洋三月份纱的日产量较二月份提高百分之四点七，四月份又比三月份提高百分之八点九。恒源纱厂四月份的正布率达到百分之九十八点七，创该厂空前纪录。在提高质量节省原料方面，长城橡胶厂，经职工耐心研究改进后，使胶鞋底的废边率减少了百分之五十，致使质量大有改进。南洋橡胶厂自改为轧胶过磅的方法后，节省原料约十分之一。在协助资方克服困难，维持生产方面，久大、永利和国光橡胶厂、光华造纸厂、瑞福祥绸缎店等单位职工，都适当的降低了工资或生活水平。工人阶级此种伟大的克己精神与高度的政治觉悟，深深感动了资方，并鼓励了他们的经营信心。许多工厂的资方，自动向工人表示愿意放弃自己“减薪裁人，缩小经营”的消极打算（如汇昌铁工厂、长城橡胶厂等）。同时由于劳资关系的趋向正常，和某些工厂的生产好转，职工福利也随之得到逐步改善。恒源纱厂自规定了临时劳保条例和增聘了女医生以后，劳动条件和职工的身体健康获得了有力的保障，北洋、达生、仁立、东亚及南洋橡胶厂，有的修筑了工人食堂和澡塘，有的在车间增设了痰盂和热水桶，有的整理了光线和厕所。
    其次，通过劳资协商会议，开始改变了各该工厂、商店中某些旧的不合理的管理制度和经营方式，逐步树立了科学的民主管理的新制度。如北洋、恒源、达生三大纱厂，于劳资协商会议成立不久，便宣布废除搜身制，并先后树立了考勤、奖惩、检验等制度。北洋纱厂的协商会议，于研究该厂摇纱间的生产之后，为进一步提高生产与改进质量，实行了新的工作法；而恒源纱厂的劳资双方，为加强协商会议与车间工人的联系与及时解决车间的问题，更建立了协商会议与工人群众之间的桥梁组织——车间生产会议。为保证红旗竞赛运动的顺利开展，协商会议又通过了临时劳保条例。利中酸厂，也根据厂内生产情况，实行了定期定员制。新的工厂管理规则和奖惩办法、劳动纪律亦在草拟中。在商店中，中华百货售品所、正华绸缎庄等，也转变了过去不适时宜的经营方针与方式。这种管理制度与经营方针的转变，不仅有力的改善了劳资关系和改进了生产与营业情况，且为进一步实行民主管理和克服目前困难、维持与发展生产及经营奠定了良好的基础。但，目前一般劳资协商的组织中，还存在着不少问题：
    一、在建立劳资协商组织过程中，由于有关部门缺乏具体指导；而劳资双方对这种组织也缺乏明确与统一的认识，资方有的是为了单纯利用劳方克服目前暂时困难的观点，或抱着一种怀疑与试探的态度；劳方有的则单纯为了解决劳保福利问题。所以组织形式复杂，名目繁多，内容零乱，有的双方代表名额时多时少，也不固定。同时，由于组织形式的限制，使不少工厂、商店的协商内容拘限于单纯讨论、制订生产计划（如“生产计划委员会”），而对有关改进生产管理、业务与职工待遇等重要问题，则协商很少。这就失掉了劳资协商会议的实际意义。因此，如何根据中央人民政府劳动部关于“在私营工商企业中设立劳资协商会议”指示的精神，结合各厂、商店中的实际情况，将这些形式不一名目繁多的协商机构予以统一与提高，使本市劳资协商会议在现有基础上求得进一步的健全和巩固，实属必要。
    二、有些工厂、商店的劳资双方，由于不十分了解劳资协商会议的意义和作用，因此，曾使目前此种组织发生两种偏向：一方面是有些资方对通过协商会议，在搞好生产劳资两利的原则下，推诚相见解决问题，缺乏诚意，处处企图“利用”工会，管制工人，或以克服困难，渡过难关为借口，强调工人降低工资和生活水平，以达资方一利的目的；另方面，有些劳方代表，在协商会议上，则借口“群众意见”“民主决议”，强求对方接受与执行自己的意见，有的甚或干涉资方的行政管理权以及人事调配等制度。这些都是不合乎劳资协商会议的基本精神的，亟需纠正。
    三、目前一般工厂、商店的劳资协商组织，尚未真正纳入正轨。这不仅表现在组织形式上，而且还表现在没有定期的会议制度、明确的会议内容和一定的协商程序等方面。有些工厂、商店的劳资双方，没有将此组织看为是改进业务搞好生产的最好的组织形式（尤其在目前，它是克服困难渡过难关的重要保证），而是把它当做了一种临时性的组织机构，会议不健全，事先不准备，因此，也就不能更好的解决问题。同时，部分协商会议的主席，不是在平等协商的原则下，由劳资双方轮流担任，而多由资方一方担任。这都是值得研究解决的问题。
