　　French Peace Movement Expands Daily
　　Reactionary Rulers Feel Panic
    [Xinhua News Agency, Fourteenth Dispatch from Paris] TASS Paris dispatch: French rulers are alarmed by the expanding peace movement and are trying to stop its development. The municipal committee of Champagne-sur-Marne hung a banner in the city hall that read "Sign the appeal against atomic weapons!" Local police tore down the banner. However, the banner was soon hung up again. The signature campaign in the Nord and Pas-de-Calais provinces was very successful. In Douai and its surrounding villages, 51,000 people have signed, and in Calais, 15,500 people have signed. Twelve socialist municipal councilors in Calais have also signed the appeal.

　　法和平运动日益扩展
　　反动统治者很感恐慌
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社巴黎讯：法国统治者对日益扩展的和平运动，很感惊慌，并力图阻止和平运动的发展。马恩河畔香槟市市政委员会，在市政厅上悬挂一幅标语，上面写着“在反对原子武器的呼吁书上签名！”当地警察竟将那幅标语撕下。然而，不久以后，那幅标语又挂起来了。诺尔省和加莱海峡省征集签名运动很成功。杜埃城及其四乡已有五万一千人签名，加莱市已有一万五千五百人签名。加莱市十二个社会党市政委员，也已在呼吁书上签名。
