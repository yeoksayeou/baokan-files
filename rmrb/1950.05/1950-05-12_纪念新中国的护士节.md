　　Commemorating the New China's Nurses Day
　　Wu Ruhe, Peking University Nursing School

The work of a nurse, when spoken of, is not as difficult as imagined, nor is it so sacred and complex; but without a resolute and persistent nursing spirit, one often becomes lost or painfully passive: this is a loss of the position of serving the people.

The so-called resolute and persistent nursing spirit must today be measured by a political standard, that is to say, we must strengthen the integration of technology and revolutionary sympathy under the slogan of "serving the people," and even more so, carry out work with "prevention first," which is the spirit of nursing work we need today. But in the old society, nursing work was contrary to this spirit. Not only was nursing work separated from the broad masses of the people, but some nurses themselves believed this was a lofty and transcendent love, confining themselves to a small circle, thus making nursing work a narrow form of freelance profession; on the other hand, nursing work could not be understood, recognized, and valued by the people, leading to the vulgar view that it was a humble job of "serving people." These are the inevitable results of the reactionary ruling old social system. We know that some nurses originally went to study nursing with a burst of enthusiasm, but when they felt that public opinion generally looked down on nursing work so much, and the work was so arduous, they became emotionally negative and discouraged, thus producing two kinds of work attitudes: one is to rely solely on their own enthusiasm, standing in their own position, limiting themselves to serving a small number of people, vaguely thinking of "doing things with their heart," but failing to adapt to the needs of the entire environment with a pragmatic attitude; the other is to drift along, keep out of trouble, and seek no merit, treating incorrect opinions with indifference, neglecting their work, which further influenced some people's views on nursing work.

Today, in the new society, in a country where the people are masters, nursing work has a different meaning. Nursing is to serve the broad masses of the people, our work objects are not only patients suffering from illness, but every father, elder, son and daughter of the People's Republic of China; grasping the spirit of serving the people, uniting and cooperating, and learning and applying our technology with a pragmatic attitude, we will play a significant role in protecting the health of the people. Therefore, the responsibility of nurses is significant, it is an indispensable link in the entire health work, we must develop, enrich, and improve ourselves along with the development of the entire health science, popularize and penetrate into the broad masses of the people to complete the glorious task. The spirit of nursing is noble and should be respected, it is a part of revolutionary work; the revolutionary war has liberated us, we must, under the banner of the new China, contribute our share of strength and shine our share of light, and learn from our Comrade Li Lanting and other heroic and strong comrades who are working hard for the revolution!

　　纪念新中国的护士节
    北大护士学校　吴汝和
    护士的工作说起来不似想像之难，也不是那么神圣复杂；但如果没有坚决持久的护理精神，往往本身茫然歧途或痛苦消极：这就丧失了为人民服务的立场。
    所谓坚苦持久的护理精神，今天必须以政治的尺度去衡量，即是说必须在“为人民服务”的口号下，加强技术与革命同情心相结合的思想，更要以“预防为主”的进行工作，才是今天我们所需要的护理工作精神。但是在旧社会里，护士工作是和这个精神相背的。护士工作不仅脱离广大的人民，而且护士本身有的认为这是崇高超然的爱，将自己蜷伏在小圈子里，因而就使得护士工作成为一种狭隘的自由职业者；另一方面护士工作不能为人们了解认识与重视，以致被庸俗的看成这是一种卑微的“侍候人”的工作。这都是反动统治旧社会制度下的必然结果。我们知道有些护士原是抱着一腔热情去学习护士的，但当觉得一般舆论对护士工作如此贱视，工作又如此坚苦的时候，就情绪消极心灰意懒，因而就产生了两种工作态度：一种是只倚赖自己的热情，站在自己的岗位上，限制在为少数人服务的圈子里，空泛的想“凭心做事，”却不能以实事求是态度适应整个环境的需要；一种是得过且过，明哲保身，但求无过，对不正确的意见，泰然处之，轻视疏忽自己的工作，这更影响了一些人们对护士工作的看法。
    今日在新的社会里，在人民作了主人翁的国家里，护士工作却有了不同的意义。护理要为广大的人民服务，我们的工作对象，不只是呻吟病苦的病人，而是中华人民共和国的每一个父老儿女；掌握住为人民服务团结合作的精神，以实事求是的态度，来学习并运用我们的技术，我们就会在保障人民健康上发挥很大的作用。因此护士的责任是重大的，它是整个卫生工作的一个不可缺少的环节，我们要随着整个卫生科学的发展来发展、充实、改进自己，普及并深入到广大的人民中间去，以完成光荣的任务。护理的精神是高尚的，应当受人尊重，它是革命工作的一部分；革命战争解放了我们，我们要在新中国的旗帜下，有一分力，发一分光，向我们的李蓝丁同志以及其他英勇坚强为革命工作努力斗争的同志们看齐吧！
