Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 28th – The People's Liberation Army's commanders and soldiers who victoriously liberated the Zhoushan Islands unanimously expressed that they would never relax and would more fully prepare for the struggle to liberate Jinmen and Taiwan. After landing on Zhoushan, the commanders and soldiers witnessed firsthand the bloody crimes of the remaining bandits in slaughtering and plundering the people, and were extremely indignant. They unanimously stated: "Wherever the enemy flees, we will chase and eliminate them!" When Wang Donghai, a soldier from a certain unit, saw the residents along the way whose husbands and sons had been captured, their eyes swollen with crying, he was also moved to tears with anger. He comforted them through his tears, "Compatriots, we must fight to Taiwan and rescue your husbands and sons!" Other soldiers also shouted excitedly and firmly: "Fight to Taiwan, avenge the Zhoushan compatriots, and liberate all the people of Taiwan!" After a certain unit was stationed in Shenjiamen, it immediately began to discuss how to complete the combat mission of liberating Taiwan in the future. The Communist Party members of the Fourth Squad of the Fifth Company of that unit unanimously believed in a group meeting that, in order to liberate Taiwan, there must be better and more complete preparations. Many boatmen who participated in the crossing to liberate Zhoushan also requested to fight to Taiwan with the troops. The Eighth Company of a certain unit said in a letter of condolence to unemployed workers in Shanghai: "Please rest assured, brothers and sisters, we will never underestimate the enemy, nor will we relax. We must advance into Taiwan, and we will surely be able to liberate Taiwan!"
