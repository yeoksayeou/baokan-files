Xinhua News Agency, May 24th:
    In Wuhan, Nanchang, Fuzhou and other cities, some private industrial and commercial enterprises have maintained production by overcoming temporary difficulties through labor-management cooperation.
    In Wuhan, among the 42 cloth shops in the city, 35 have had their shop assistants appropriately reduce their wages. Some shop assistants have also reduced their food expenses and eliminated tea and cigarette expenditures. Among them, Yihe Cloth Shop has reduced its expenses by more than 37 million yuan per month, causing the management to abandon its plan to close down. Now, the shop's management is trying to raise funds and is accepting the suggestions of the shop assistants to purchase more popular fabrics, striving for more sales to maintain business. After labor-management consultation, the private Cangwei Shipping Company reduced factory expenses, organized a thrift group, and checked and corrected serious waste phenomena. The management also made the accounts public and absorbed the staff's opinions to improve operations. In April, the company's expenditures were more than 62 million yuan less than the original budget, and income increased by more than 74 million yuan. Business has changed from a loss to a surplus. In addition, more than ten industries in the city's private industry, such as textiles and tobacco, and commerce, such as food, department stores, groceries, and cloth, have formed labor-management consultation committees. Other labor-management consultation committees based on shops and factories are also being generally established.
    In Nanchang, the business situation of some private industrial and commercial enterprises has also improved after labor and management have signed collective contracts or conducted business consultations. For example, the China Book Bureau and the Commercial Press avoided the crisis of bankruptcy and achieved significant development in their business because the shop assistants proposed to the management to promote progressive books and sell stationery, and voluntarily reduced their salaries. At Zhenhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory, workers voluntarily formulated production plans and labor discipline, and mutually supervised to improve production efficiency, so that output gradually increased, thereby promoting the management to actively operate and set up offices in various places to promote products.
    In Fuzhou, some private industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood have also maintained production with the active assistance of the labor side in overcoming difficulties. For example, workers at the Fuzhou Paper Mill voluntarily received 70% of their wages, and launched a conservation campaign and used methods such as using rags, waste cotton, and reeds instead of wood pulp to reduce costs, thereby maintaining production. Employees of the Minjiang Shipping Company receive 50% to 70% of their wages each month to assist the company in building new ships, and try their best to retrofit more than 60% of the ships with charcoal engines, so that each ship can save more than 1.2 million yuan in round-trip costs within a 400-mile voyage. In addition, the Fuzhou Municipal People's Government has also cooperated with the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Federation of Industry and Commerce to support private industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood through loans, purchasing finished products, and setting loan quotas to solve the capital and sales difficulties of these industries.

　　武汉等市私营工商业
    劳资协力维持生产           
    不少行业营业显著改善
    【新华社二十四日讯】武汉、南昌、福州三市若干私营工商业，因劳资协力克服目前暂时的困难，维持了生产。
    武汉全市四十二家布店中，有三十五家的店员适当减低了工资，有些店员并减少了菜金和取消茶烟开支。其中怡和布店每月即因此减少了开支三千七百余万元，使资方放弃了停业打算。现该店资方正设法筹集资金，并接受店员的建议，多进大众化的布匹，争取多销，以维持营业。私营仓潍轮船公司经过劳资协商，减低了厂内开支，组织节约小组，检查和纠正了严重的浪费现象；资方亦公开了账目，吸收职员改进营业的意见。四月份该公司支开即较原预算减少了六千二百余万元；收入却增加了七千四百余万元，营业已由亏本转为盈余。此外，该市私营工业中纺织、烟草等业，商业中食品、百货、杂货、布匹等业共十余个行业已组成了劳资协商委员会。其余以商店、工厂为单位的劳资协商委员会亦在普遍成立中。
    南昌市若干私营工商业劳资双方在订立集体合同或进行业务协商后营业情况也获得好转。如中华书局和商务印书馆由于店员们向资方提出推销进步书籍和出售文具，并自动减低薪水，避免了倒闭的危机，营业并有了显著的发展。振华染织工厂，工人们自动订立生产计划、劳动纪律，互相督促提高生产效率，使产量逐渐增加，因而推动资方积极经营，在各地设立办事处推销产品。
    福州市若干有利于国计民生的私营工商业也在劳方积极协助资方克服困难下，维持了生产。如福州造纸厂工人自动按七折领取工资，并展开节约运动和利用破布、败絮、芦苇代替木浆等办法来减低成本，因而维持了生产。闽江轮船公司职工每月领五至七成工资以协助公司建造新船，并想尽办法将百分之六十以上的轮船改装木炭机，使每只船在四百里航程内来回可节省人民币一百二十余万元。此外，福州市人民政府亦已协同市总工会、工商联合会，以贷款、收购成品及定贷等办法扶植有利于国计民生的私营工商业，以解决各该业的资金和销路的困难。
