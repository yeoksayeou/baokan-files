Introduction to the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union

　　The All-Union Young Communist League of the Soviet Union was founded in 1918. In 1924, after Lenin's death, the Youth League changed its name to the Leninist Young Communist League in memory of its founder. With its courage and exemplary actions, the Youth League has become the core and vanguard of Soviet youth. The Youth League currently has ten million members and publishes ninety newspapers and twenty-two magazines. Its activities penetrate every department of the country.

　　The Youth League grew up under the direct guidance and cultivation of Lenin and Stalin. In 1920, Lenin stipulated that the tasks of the Youth League were: to master the wealth of knowledge, to participate in labor, to participate in the common struggle of workers and peasants, and to train themselves to become communists. Stalin taught the Youth League members to participate in construction and to be proficient in advanced science.

　　For more than 30 years, Soviet youth and the Youth League have experienced a glorious path.

　　Under the promotion of the Youth League, during the period of economic construction after the October Revolution, thousands of young men and women participated in the construction of the Stalingrad Tractor Factory; 66,000 young people worked in Siberia and the Urals; 36,000 young people, under extremely difficult conditions, restored the Donbass coal mines; 10,000 young people participated in the construction of the Moscow subway; on the Dnieper River, young people participated in the construction of hydroelectric power stations; in the Amur region, young people built a new city - Komsomolsk (meaning the city of the Komsomol). As early as 1929, young people participated in the establishment of 5,000 collective farms. Due to its labor achievements, the Youth League was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor.

　　The Bolshevik Party's education cultivated the innovative labor thinking of the Youth League members. During the two Five-Year Plans, the Youth League first rose up with a new type of worker. The Leningrad Youth League members initiated the organization of shock brigades, and the Donbass young coal miner Stakhanov (a Youth League member, now an engineer) launched the Stakhanov movement with his extraordinary coal mining achievements, and this new type of socialist competition immediately spread throughout the country, creating a high tide of economic construction.

　　When the Hitler bandit gang invaded the Soviet Union, the Youth League members rose up to defend the country, and countless brilliant heroes emerged. The heroic and unyielding Danya, Matrosov who blocked the enemy's gun nest with his body, and the Young Guard Olik and others have become models for the world's democratic youth to fight. Due to the heroic actions of the Youth League, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union awarded it the Order of Lenin.

　　In the years of post-war construction, Soviet youth and Youth League members participated in labor with infinite enthusiasm. They rebuilt Stalingrad and reconstructed the Donbass coal mines and the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station. Now, 450,000 young workers have completed the work of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. During the 31st anniversary of the Youth League last year (October 29), 2 million young workers had completed the first four years of the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. New young labor heroes are emerging everywhere. The outstanding lathe operator, Youth League member Chibatkevich, created a world record of cutting metal at 700 meters per second, increasing labor productivity to 1,269 percent. Youth League members have made outstanding achievements in various fields of activity. In 1946-47, 230 Youth League members won Stalin Prizes in science and literature and art.

　　In the great movement of youth around the world to defend peace and democracy, Soviet youth and the Soviet Youth League occupy a leading position. The Soviet Youth League is the backbone of the World Federation of Democratic Youth. The unity of Soviet youth and world democratic youth, especially the cooperation with Chinese youth, has become an invincible force in the camp of peace and democracy.

　　苏联列宁共产主义青年团介绍
    苏联共产主义青年团成立于一九一八年。一九二四年列宁逝世后，青年团为了纪念自己的缔造人，改名为列宁共产主义青年团。青年团以其勇敢与模范行动成为苏联青年的核心与先锋。青年团现有团员一千万人，发行九十种报纸和二十二种杂志。它的活动深入国家的每个部门。
    青年团是在列宁和斯大林的直接教导和培育下成长起来的。一九二○年，列宁规定青年团的任务是：掌握知识财富，参加劳动，参加工农的共同斗争，训练自己成为共产主义者。斯大林教导青年团员们参加建设，并且要精通先进科学。
    三十多年来，苏联青年和青年团经历了光荣的道路。
    在青年团的推动之下，在十月革命后的经济建设时期，成千的男女青年参加建设了斯大林格勒拖拉机工厂；六万六千青年在西伯利亚和乌拉尔工作；三万六千青年在极度困难的条件下，修复了顿巴斯煤矿；一万青年参加了莫斯科地下铁道的建设；在第聂伯河上，青年们参加修建了水电站；在阿穆尔区，青年们建设了一座新的城市——库索摩尔斯克（意思是共青团之城）。早在一九二九年，青年们即参加建立了五千处集体农庄。由于劳动的功绩，青年团曾获得劳动红旗勋章。
    布尔什维克党的教育培养了青年团员的革新的劳动思想。在两次五年计划中间，青年团首先崛起了新型的劳动者。列宁格勒青年团员发起组织了突击队，顿巴斯的青年煤矿工人斯塔哈诺夫（青年团员，现在是工程师），以特异的掘煤成绩掀起了斯塔哈诺夫运动，这一新型的社会主义竞赛即刻普及全国。造成了经济建设的高潮。
    当希特勒匪帮侵入苏联时，青年团员奋起卫国，出现了无数光辉的英雄。英勇不屈的丹娘，横身阻拦敌人枪巢的马特洛索夫，青年近卫军奥立克等人，已成为全世界民主青年战斗的典范。由于青年团的英雄行为，苏联最高苏维埃主席团曾颁给它列宁勋章。
    在战后建设的岁月中，苏联青年和青年团员以无限的热情参加了劳动。他们重建了斯大林格勒，再度建设了顿巴斯煤矿和第聂伯水电站。现在已有四十五万青年工人先期完成了五年计划的工作，在去年青年团三十一周年纪念时（十月二十九日），有二百万青年工人已提前完成了五年计划的头四年工作。新的青年劳动英雄到处涌现，杰出的旋工，青年团员奇巴特克维奇造成每秒钟割切金属七百米的世界纪录，把劳动生产率提高到百分之一千二百六十九。青年团员在各种活动领域中都创造了卓越的成绩。在一九四六——四七年，就有二百三十个青年团员在科学和文学艺术方面获得了斯大林奖金。
    在全世界青年保卫和平、保卫民主的伟大运动中，苏联青年和苏联青年团居于领袖的地位。苏联青年团是世界民主青年联盟的中坚。苏联青年和世界民主青年的团结，特别是和中国青年的携手，已成为和平民主阵营里一支无敌的力量。
