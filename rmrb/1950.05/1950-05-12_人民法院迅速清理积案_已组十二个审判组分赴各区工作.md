　　People's Court Quickly Clears Backlogged Cases
　　Twelve Trial Groups Formed and Dispatched to Various Districts

[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] In order to quickly clear backlogged cases and reduce the burden of litigation on the people, the Beijing People's Court recently obtained approval from the Municipal People's Government to transfer more than 260 cadres from various municipal agencies, schools, and organizations to assist in the work. On the 10th, a mobilization meeting was held for all the more than 400 staff members participating in this work. Shen Junru, President of the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government, and Zhang Youyu and Wu Han, both Deputy Mayors of the Municipal People's Government, personally attended the meeting. President Shen and Deputy Mayor Zhang gave mobilization reports at the meeting. President Shen said: "Such a vigorous effort to clear backlogged cases is unprecedented in judicial work. This precisely demonstrates the People's Government's high sense of responsibility to the people." Deputy Mayor Zhang pointed out in his speech: "In the past, we accumulated these cases mainly because we did not break away from the generalized and complicated procedures in our trial work and further create new working methods. Therefore, in this clearing of backlogged cases, we must break the old work methods and create simple and clear working methods." Finally, Wang Feiran, President of the Beijing People's Court, reported on the plan and organizational process for this clearing of backlogged cases and explained several specific issues related to the work.

As of May 4th, the cases backlogged in the court totaled 3,508, including 2,625 civil cases and 883 criminal cases. This clearing of backlogged cases is divided into two parts: inside and outside the court. The focus is on outside the court, and the outside work is divided into twelve trial groups based on districts to hear general civil cases and minor criminal cases. General criminal cases will still be handled inside the court. In terms of procedures, civil cases will use simplified judgments, and criminal cases will use disposition forms to save time and improve work efficiency. At the same time, the office of the trial committee will implement collective work, specifically responsible for inspection, review, liaison, and solving difficulties encountered in various places.

[Further News] The twelve trial groups formed by the Beijing People's Court to handle backlogged cases were dispatched to various districts yesterday (the 11th) with backlogged civil cases and minor criminal cases to begin work. Notices from the People's Court have been posted in front of the district offices: all parties involved in civil cases and minor criminal cases that have been filed in the People's Court should immediately go to the designated location for questioning upon receiving notification from the trial group in their district to await processing.

General new lawsuits must still be filed with the Municipal People's Court.

　　人民法院迅速清理积案
　　已组十二个审判组分赴各区工作
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民法院为了迅速清理积案，减少人民讼累，特于日前呈准市人民政府自市区各机关学校团体调集干部二百六十余人帮助工作，并于十日召集参加此次工作的全体工作人员四百余人举行动员大会。中央人民政府最高人民法院沈钧儒院长，市人民政府张友渔、吴晗两副市长均亲自到会。沈院长、张副市长并在大会作了动员报告。沈院长说：像这样大力的清理积压案件，是司法工作从来没有过的事情，这正是说明人民政府对人民高度的负责精神。张副市长在讲话中指出：过去我们积了这些案件，主要是由于我们在审判工作上没有摆脱一般化的繁复手续，进一步创造出新的工作方法，因此这次清理积案，我们要打破老一套的工作方法，创造简易明确的工作方法。最后由北京市人民法院王斐然院长报告这次清理积案的计划和组织经过，并对工作上的几个具体问题作了说明。
    法院积压的案件截至五月四日止共为三千五百零八件，其中民事案件为二千六百二十五件，刑事案件为八百八十三件。这次清理积案工作，分成院内和院外南两部分进行，重点放在院外，院外工作以区为单位划分十二个审判组，审理一般民事案件和轻微刑事案件，一般的刑事案件则仍在院内处理。在手续方面，民事案件采用简易判决书，刑事案件用处分表，以节省时间，提高工作效率。同时审判委员会办公室实行集体办公，专负检查、核稿、联络等工作并解决各处发生的困难问题。
    【又讯】北京市人民法院为处理积案所组成的十二个审判组，已于昨（十一）日携带积压的民事案件和轻微的刑事案件，分赴各区开始工作。各区公所门前已贴出人民法院公告：凡曾在人民法院起诉的民事案件和轻微的刑事案件，双方当事人于接到所在区审判组的通知后，应即按期赴指定地点应讯，听候处理。
    一般的新诉讼案件则仍须向市人民法院起诉。
