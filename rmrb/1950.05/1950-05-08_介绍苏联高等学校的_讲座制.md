　　Introduction to the "Chair System" in Soviet Higher Education
　　Our Reporter Jin Feng

　　The reform of teaching organization and teaching administrative organization is an important issue in the transformation of Chinese higher education today. Now, we introduce the important teaching organization of Soviet higher education – the chair system (or translated as teaching and research department), as a reference for various universities to reform teaching organizations. This is written based on conversations with Soviet education administration expert V. Lichkovsky, professor Alchinzhev of the Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute, and professor Qi Weikeva, director of the teaching and research office of the Renmin University of China.

　　One of the characteristics and advantages of the Soviet higher education system is that within a rigorous teaching organization, teaching and academic research work are carried out in a unified and closely linked manner, effectively serving socialist construction. Such a teaching organization is called a chair (or translated as a teaching and research department), and is the basic educational organization of Soviet higher education institutions.

　　The chair is organized by discipline and consists of one or several closely related subjects. In a school, there can be school-wide public subject chairs, such as the Marxism-Leninism chair. There are also specialized subject chairs in various departments, such as the biology chair, geology chair, etc. A subject chair can include several courses: for example, the Russian language chair includes courses such as "The Origin and Development of General Language," "Modern Language," "Local Dialects," and "Slavic Dialects." School-wide public subject chairs are directly led by the vice president responsible for teaching and research work, while specialized subject chairs in each department are jointly led by the heads of each department and the vice president. The leadership of the daily work of the chair is the responsibility of the director of the chair. The members of the chair include the chair director who lectures on the course, professors, associate professors, as well as the chief lecturers, lecturers, teaching assistants, laboratory directors, laboratory technicians, assistant laboratory directors, laboratory assistants, etc. who participate in other teaching work. They each carry out fixed quotas of teaching work and research work in specific work positions. Roughly, each person's daily working time (including teaching and research work) is six hours. The number of chairs varies from school to school; for example, Moscow University has 153 chairs. The tasks and content of the chair are very extensive and complex, including leading teaching, leading academic research, improving the cultural, scientific, political, and ideological level of chair members, and training new scientific workers, etc. These four aspects are organically linked and mutually influential. The latter three aspects of work are closely centered around and guaranteeing the teaching work, which is the main content.

　　The primary task of the chair is to do a good job in teaching. Its content includes lecturing, formulating and implementing teaching plans in accordance with the teaching syllabus, and leading students' learning in a planned manner. Each member of the chair is fully responsible for the teaching work assigned to each person. The chair director, professors, associate professors, lecturers, etc. undertake the direct teaching work of the course – lecturing and tutoring internships. Their lecture hours have a certain standard, the general regulations are: within the six-hour work time of each chair member every day, the chair director should have an average of 2.25 to 2.75 hours of teaching time per day (including lectures and tutoring internships), with a total teaching time of 540 to 660 hours per year; professors and associate professors have an average of 2.75 to 3.25 hours of teaching time per day (a total of 660 to 780 hours per year), and lecturers have 3 to 3.5 hours (a total of 720 to 840 hours per year). In addition, the chair director leads the chair members in researching and discussing the teaching syllabus stipulated by the Ministry of Higher Education, and formulates the teaching plan for the entire chair according to the teaching syllabus, on a semester-by-semester and class-by-class basis. The plan includes the content, progress, and teaching methods of all courses, experiments, and extracurricular assignments within the chair. At the same time, each professor, associate professor, and lecturer within the chair formulates a specific teaching plan for each person and each course, and implements it after passing it at the chair work meeting. Supervising and inspecting the implementation of the teaching plans of professors, associate professors, and lecturers is carried out through the chair director's observation of teachers' lectures, checking assignments, designating teachers to observe each other, and discussing these observation opinions at work meetings, and making regular summaries of teaching work. In leading students' learning, the chair director leads teachers to systematically tutor students to carry out internships and other extracurricular learning activities. Chair members must ensure that students are guided to implement the practical effects of teaching in different learning methods, which is also an important sign of checking their teaching performance.

　　The second task of the chair is to lead academic research work. Each chair formulates a one-year scientific research work plan for the chair according to the research tasks designated by the Ministry of Higher Education or other relevant departments; each member of the chair formulates their own specific research plan based on the principle of a common plan, conducts certain research work under the leadership of the director, holds reports at regular meetings, and makes a summary of research work at the end of the year. The content of research work includes solving the research tasks designated by the Ministry of Education or other relevant departments, solving scientific and technological problems in the main national economic sectors, conducting pure scientific theoretical and practical research work, compiling, revising, and supplementing textbooks reflecting the actual situation of science and technology and various courses within the scope of the chair, studying the improvement of teaching methods, and carrying out the popularization of science and technology of this department within the chair (through broadcasting, writing popular pamphlets, and holding exhibitions). All of these research works are closely related to actual construction and teaching work, and effectively solve the problems that occur in actual construction undertakings and teaching work. This close connection between theory and practice is the principle and characteristic of scientific research and educational construction in socialist Soviet Union.

　　The third task of the chair is to train new scientific work cadres – graduate students. Various universities recruit graduate students from outstanding graduates of the school or other schools who meet the conditions. Each graduate student participates in the chair of the subject he/she wants to specialize in for study. The chair director formulates a three-year research work plan for graduate students (the research time for graduate students requires a total of three years). During these three years, graduate students must complete the following tasks: complete one social science, two foreign languages, and one specialized science; make a scientific research report on specially selected courses in the native language and foreign language; participate in certain teaching work and scientific production practice in the chair. The above are all the work of the first two years, and the third year starts to do the degree thesis. Each graduate student is a member of the chair to which he/she belongs, and he/she must report the implementation of his/her research plan at the chair meeting at least twice a year. The chair director appoints a professor or associate professor as the scientific guide for each graduate student. Each scientific guide must have a seminar with his/her graduate students once a week. Each chair must regularly review the graduate students' degree thesis reports chapter by chapter. Each chair must also organize special lectures and problem solving for all graduate students in universities according to their own disciplines. For example, the Marxism-Leninism chair organizes reports and problem solving related to Marxism-Leninism for all graduate students in universities.

　　The fourth task of the chair is to improve the scientific and cultural level and political and ideological level of chair members. Its main content, on the one hand, is that the Party and the trade union conduct political and ideological education through the chair, combining the specific disciplines of each chair, organizing chair members to study Marxism-Leninism and Stalin's theory, and improve their political and ideological level; on the other hand, through the inspection and summary of research work and teaching work, organize scientific special reports and typical teaching work reports to improve the cultural and scientific level of chair members. Obviously, this task of the chair is closely linked to the tasks of teaching and research work, and the direct result of completing this task in turn guarantees the continuous improvement of teaching quality and the continuous development of academic research achievements.

　　Because the chair has such extensive and complex tasks and work content, the director who is directly responsible for leading the work of the chair is solemnly selected from professors or associate professors by the university and submitted to the relevant departments for approval and appointment. They are all scholars with a position in academics and a high level of political awareness, who are good at closely integrating teaching work and scientific research work with the tasks of socialist construction to complete the arduous mission undertaken by the chair.

　　介绍苏联高等学校的“讲座制”
    本报记者  金凤
    教学组织和教学行政组织的改革，是今天中国高等教育改造中的一个重要问题。现在介绍苏联高等学校重要的教学组织——讲座制，作为各地大学改革教学组织的参考。这是根据苏联教育行政专家魏力契可夫斯基、马列学院教授阿尔钦吉夫以及中国人民大学教研室主任齐维珂娃教授的谈话写成的。
    苏联高等教育制度的特点和优点之一，就是在严密的教学组织内，统一进行密切联系的教学和学术研究工作，有效地为社会主义建设服务。这样的教学组织称为讲座（或译作教研室），是苏联高等学校的基本教育组织。
    讲座以学科为单位由一个或几个有着密切联系的学科组成。一个学校中，可以有全校性的公共学科的讲座，如马列主义讲座。也有各系专门学科的讲座，如生物学讲座、地质学讲座等。一门学科的讲座又可以包括好几门课程：如俄文讲座包括了《一般语言的发生及其发展》、《现代语言》、《各地方言》、《斯拉夫方言》等多门课程。全校公共学科的讲座直接由负责教学和研究工作的副校长领导，各系专门学科的讲座，则由各系主任和副校长共同领导。讲座日常工作的领导，则归主持讲座的主任负责。讲座的成员包括主讲课程的讲座主任、教授、副教授以及参加其他教学工作的主任讲师、讲师、助教、实验主任、实验员、实验助理主任、实验助理等。他们各自在一定的工作岗位上分别进行定额的教学工作和研究工作。大致每人每天的工作时间（包括教学和研究工作）是六小时。讲座的数目各校不同，如莫斯科大学有一百五十三个讲座。讲座的任务和内容十分广泛复杂，包括领导教学、领导学术研究，提高讲座成员的文化科学水平和政治思想水平和培养新的科学工作者等四个方面。这四方面是有机地相互连结，相互影响着的。而后三方面的工作又都是紧紧围绕和保证着作为主要内容的教学工作进行的。
    讲座的首要任务是做好教学工作。它的内容包括讲课、按照教学纲领制订和执行教学计划以及有计划地领导学生的学习。讲座的每一成员对各人分工负责的教学工作负完全责任。讲座主任和教授、副教授、讲师等担任课程的直接教学工作——讲课和辅导实习。他们讲课的钟点有一定的标准，一般的规定是：在讲座成员每人每天六小时的工作时间内，讲座主任平均每天要有二·二五到二·七五小时的教学时间（包括讲课和辅导实习）全年教学时间共计五四○到六六○小时），教授、副教授每天的教学时间平均为二·七五到三·二五小时（全年共计六六○到七八○小时），讲师则为三到三·五小时（全年共计七二○到八四○小时）。此外，讲座主任领导讲座成员研究和讨论高等教育部所规定的教学纲领，并根据教学纲领，按学期按班次地制订整个讲座的教学计划。计划内容包括讲座内所有课程、实验以及课外作业的内容、进度、教学法等。同时讲座内每个教授、副教授、讲师都制订各人及各门课程的具体教学计划，在讲座工作会议上通过执行。监督和检查教授、副教授、讲师的教学计划的执行工作，是通过讲座主任旁听教师的讲课、检查作业、指定教师彼此旁听以及在工作会议上讨论这些旁听意见、定期作教学工作总结等办法来进行的。在领导学生的学习方面，讲座主任领导教员有计划地辅导学生进行实习和其他课外的学习活动。讲座成员要保证引导学生在不同的学习方式中贯彻教学的实际效果，这也是检查他们教学工作成绩的重要的标志。
    讲座的第二个任务是领导学术研究工作。各讲座根据高等教育部或其他有关部门所指定的研究任务制订讲座的一年科学研究工作计划；讲座各个成员以共同计划为原则，再制订自己的具体研究计划，在主任领导下进行一定的研究工作，在定期会议上举行报告，一年终了时作出研究工作的总结。研究工作的内容包括解决教育部或其他有关部门所指定的研究任务，解决主要的国民经济部门中的科学技术问题，进行纯科学上的理论和实际的研究工作，编写、修正和补充讲座范围内反映科学和技术实况以及各门课程的教材，研究教学法的改进以及进行讲座内本部门科学技术的普及工作（通过广播、写通俗小册子，举办展览会）等。所有这些研究工作，都是和实际建设和教学工作有着密切的联系，切实地解决着实际建设事业和教学工作中所发生的问题。这种理论和实际的密切联系，就是社会主义苏联的科学研究和教育建设的原则和特色。
    讲座的第三个任务是培养新的科学工作干部——研究生。各高等学校从本校或外校的合于条件的优秀毕业生中招收研究生。各研究生参加他所要专攻学科的讲座进行研习。讲座主任制订研究生三年的研究工作计划（研究生研究时间一共需要三年）。三年中研究生要做到下列这些工作：修完一门社会科学，二种外国话和一门专修的科学；用本国语和外国语做出特别选修课程的科学研究报告；参加讲座一定的教学工作和科学生产实习。以上这些都是前二年的工作，第三年起开始做学位论文。各研究生都是所属讲座的一员，他每年至少要有两次在讲座会议上报告自己的研究计划的执行。每一研究生由讲座主任指定一位教授或副教授做他的科学指导。每一科学指导，每周要和自己的研究生们座谈一次。各讲座要定期分章审核研究生的学位论文报告。各讲座又要按本门学科，为高等学校所有研究生们组织专题讲演和问题解答。譬如马列主义讲座就为高等学校全体研究生组织有关马列主义的报告和问题解答等。
    讲座的第四个任务是提高讲座成员的科学文化水平和政治思想水平。它的主要内容，一方面是党和职工会通过讲座，结合各个讲座的具体学科进行政治思想教育，组织讲座成员学习马列主义和斯大林学说，提高他们的政治思想水平；另一方面通过研究工作以及教学工作的检查、总结，组织科学专题报告和典型教学工作报告来提高讲座成员的文化科学水平。很显明的，讲座的这个任务是和教学以及研究工作的任务紧密连结着的，而完成这个任务的直接结果又反过来保证了教学质量的不断提高以及学术研究成就的不断发展。
    由于讲座有着这样广泛复杂的任务和工作内容，因此直接负责领导讲座工作的主任，是由高等学校郑重地从教授或副教授中选拔出来，提请有关部门批准任命的。他们都是在学术上有地位，而且有高度政治水平的学者，善于将教学工作和科学研究工作与社会主义建设的任务密切结合起来，完成讲座所担负的艰巨的使命。
