　　Divorce Certificate from Place A Remains Valid in Place B
　　To the Editor:
　　I am from Shangzhuang Village, Fourth District, Longyao County, Hebei Province. At the age of fifteen, I was arranged by my parents to marry Shan Kunyan (female) from this village. Two months after the marriage, I went to work in the electromechanical team of the Mentougou Coal Mine Company. In 1948, Shan Kunyan came to Mentougou, and after living together for more than a year, we had a bad relationship. Later, with mutual consent, we applied for a divorce to the 20th District People's Government of Beijing, and the People's Government issued a divorce certificate, Beijing Divorce No. 10, and ruled that all my savings over the years (two bolts of white cloth, one bolt of green cloth, and one bolt of blue cloth) should be given to the woman, and I should pay for her to return to her mother's home. I did everything as instructed. After she got home, she only stayed for two days and then came to my house, saying that the divorce certificate was invalid. She and I went to the district government to reason with them, but the district said there was no solution and transferred the matter to the Judicial Section of Longyao County. However, the Judicial Section said that we divorced in Beijing and they were not responsible and wanted me to file another lawsuit. Now Shan Kunyan goes to my house every day, pointing fingers and scolding, causing unrest in my family. I myself cannot return to work in the mine. When I ask the Judicial Section, they say that they will only take care of it if I file another lawsuit.
　　Editor, all the laws and decrees of the People's Government are unified, how can a divorce certificate from Place A not be valid in Place B? Please give me an answer.

　　Editor's Note: A divorce certificate from Place A remains valid in Place B. The Judicial Section of the Longyao County People's Government should handle it appropriately.

　　甲地的离婚证到乙地仍有效编辑同志：
    我是河北省隆尧县第四区尚庄村人。十五岁时由家长包办和本村单昆彦（女）结婚。结婚后两个月，我就到门头沟煤矿公司机电组作工。一九四八年单昆彦由家来门，相处一年多，感情不好。后经双方同意，向北京市二十区人民政府提出离婚，并经人民政府发给京离廿字第十号离婚证书，当场判定将我几年来的积蓄（白市布两匹，青市布一匹，蓝市布一匹）全数给了女方，并由我出资把女方送回娘家去。我一一照办。她到家后，只住了两天，又找到我家，说离婚证无效。我和她到区政府去说理，区里说没有办法，就把这事情转到隆尧县司法科。可是司法科说我俩是在北京离的婚，他们不负责任，要我另行起诉。现在单昆彦天天到我家去，指东骂西，闹得我一家不安。我本人也不能回矿工作。问司法科，司法科说只有另行起诉，他们才管。
    编者同志，人民政府的一切法令是统一的，怎么甲地的离婚证件拿到乙地就不能生效呢？请给我一个答复吧。

    编者按：甲地的离婚证，到乙地仍有效。隆尧县人民政府司法科应予适当处理。
