　　Our People Face Unreasonable Restrictions Entering and Exiting Hong Kong
    Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu Protests to Britain
    [Xinhua News Agency, May 9th] British negotiation representative, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Mr. H.A. Hallett, delivered a letter to Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our Central People's Government on April 28th, informing that concerning the matter of Chinese people entering and exiting Hong Kong, the British authorities in Hong Kong have decided, effective immediately, to treat them the same as people of other nationalities, subject to the same controls. Regarding this unreasonable and unfriendly behavior by the British authorities in Hong Kong, Vice Minister Zhang lodged a protest with the British government on May 8th and demanded that necessary measures be taken to immediately revoke all restrictions on Chinese people entering and exiting Hong Kong. The full text of the protest is as follows: To Representative H.A. Hallett:
    I received your letter No. 23 (430/50) of April 27th on April 28th, stating: The British authorities in Hong Kong will, on April 28th of this year, revoke the special exemption treatment stipulated in Article 34 of the "Hong Kong Immigration Control Ordinance of 1949" regarding Chinese nationals entering and leaving the country, exempting them from handling travel documents in accordance with Articles 18, 24, and 25 of the ordinance. Hereafter, Chinese nationals will be subject to the same controls as other nationalities, and so on. It has been over a hundred years since Chinese nationals entering and exiting Hong Kong have been treated as foreign immigrants; the British authorities in Hong Kong have absolutely no reason to treat Chinese nationals the same as other foreign immigrants. Therefore, the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China cannot but regard the recently promulgated and implemented measures by the British authorities in Hong Kong to control the entry and exit of Chinese nationals as an unreasonable and unfriendly act towards the People's Republic of China and its people. A protest is hereby lodged with the British government. The Central People's Government believes that the British government should take necessary measures to immediately revoke all restrictions on Chinese nationals entering and exiting Hong Kong. I respectfully convey this. With kind regards.
        Zhang Hanfu (signed), Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China
                          May 8th, 1950.

　　我国人出入香港竟受无理限制
    章汉夫副部长向英提出抗议
    【新华社九日讯】英国谈判代表胡阶森临时代办，于四月二十八日以公函一件送交我中央人民政府外交部章汉夫副部长，通知关于中国人出入香港事，香港英国当局决定自即日起将与其他国籍人一律看待，受同等管制。对于香港英国当局此种不合理与不友好之行为，我章副部长特于五月八日向英国政府提出抗议，并要求采取必要措置，立即撤销对中国人出入香港之一切限制。抗议全文如下：胡阶森代表阁下：
    四月二十八日接  阁下四月二十七日第二十三号（430／50）来函略称：香港英国当局将于本年四月二十八日撤销“一九四九年香港入境管制法令”第三十四条所规定的对中国籍人出入境免予按照该法令第十八、二十四及二十五各款办理旅行证件之特别豁免待遇，嗣后中国籍人亦将与其他国籍人一律受有同等管制，等语。查中国籍人出入香港，百余年来从未被作为外国移民待遇；香港英国当局亦绝无任何理由可以将中国籍人与其他外国移民一律看待，因此，对于香港英国当局最近业已颁布实施之管制中国籍人出入香港办法，中华人民共和国中央人民政府不能不视为一种对中华人民共和国及其人民之不合理的与不友好的行为，特向英国政府提出抗议。中央人民政府认为英国政府应采取必要措置，即予撤销对中国籍人出入香港之一切限制。专此奉达。顺致敬意
        中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部副部长章汉夫（签名）
                          一九五○、五、八。
