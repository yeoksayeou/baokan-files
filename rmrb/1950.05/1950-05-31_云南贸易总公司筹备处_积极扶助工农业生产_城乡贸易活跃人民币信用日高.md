Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 29th: The Yunnan Trade Corporation Preparatory Office is actively supporting industrial and agricultural production and stimulating the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. From March to May, the company signed contracts with 135 private factories in Kunming engaged in knitting, chemical, hardware, and electrical materials industries. This involved purchasing finished products, placing orders, acting as a sales agent for products, and assisting in resolving raw material issues. This initially solved the difficulties faced by various factories with slow sales of products and tight capital turnover. For soap alone, the company purchased 20,000 cases, enabling the products of ten soap factories such as Yongqing and Dali to be distributed to various counties and the vast rural areas through the trade company's branch offices. In the knitting industry, the trade company purchased a large quantity of towels and socks from 45 factories such as Zhongxing and Huachang, providing cotton merchants with the convenience of purchasing cotton to supply yarn mills, helping the cotton spinning industry resume production; at the same time, it also purchased homespun cloth and locally woven fine cloth for sale to the countryside. The trade company also systematically purchased bristles, feathers, tung oil, and other vegetable oils, helping rural areas sell local products and resolving the difficulty of capital accumulation for urban manufacturers. More than 30 of the 40-plus bristle businesses in Kunming that had been shut down have now resumed operations. As a result of the active trade between urban and rural areas, the credit of the Renminbi in rural areas is increasing daily. Ethnic minorities in various regions have used silver dollars and refused to use paper money for decades, but now they also welcome the Renminbi.

    【新华社昆明二十九日电】云南贸易总公司筹备处积极扶助工农业生产，活跃城乡物资交流。该公司在三月至五月间曾分别与昆明市针织、化工、五金、电料等业一百三十五个私营工厂订立合同，收购成品、定货，代销产品，及协助解决原料问题，初步解决了各厂产品滞销，资金周转不灵的困难。仅肥皂一项由该公司收购者先后即达二万箱，使永庆、大利等十家肥皂厂的产品通过各地贸易公司分支机构推销到各县及广大农村。针织业方面，贸易公司向中兴、华昌等四十五厂收购大量手巾、线袜，给棉花商以购进棉花的便利，以供应纱厂，帮助棉纺业恢复生产；同时又收购土布及当地所织细布，向农村推销。贸易公司又曾有计划地收购猪鬃、羽毛、桐油，及其他植物油，帮助农村销售土产并解决城市厂商资金积压的困难。昆市四十多家陷于停顿的猪鬃业，已有三十多家开工。城乡贸易活跃的结果，人民币在农村的信誉日高。各地少数民族几十年来都沿用银元拒用纸币，他们现在也欢迎人民币了。
