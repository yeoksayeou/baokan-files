　　Suburban Farmers Vigorously Eliminate Insect Pests
    Winnowing Basket Method is Effective and Widely Adopted
    [Reported by this newspaper] From April 20th onwards, wheat leaf bee (larvae) pests were successively discovered in wheat fields in 54 villages in districts 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, and 20 of the Beijing suburbs, affecting an area of approximately 5,000 mu. Farmers in various villages, under the leadership of the People's Governments of each district and the District Committees of the Chinese Communist Party, have begun to intensify their efforts to capture and kill the pests. The winnowing basket rapid-push method for scooping up and capturing wheat seedlings, created by farmers in Guandongdian in District 13 and Wulituo in District 19, has been imitated and used by farmers in many areas. As of the statistics of April 28th, the above-mentioned districts had organized 8,015 people, capturing a total of more than 2,100 jin of insects. The wheat leaf bee is commonly known as the "Qi Tou Chong" or "Ye Dao Chong," and is about seven or eight fen long, a dark brown fleshy worm. This insect reproduces extremely quickly, hiding in the loose soil and rotten grass under the wheat roots during the day and climbing onto the wheat seedlings at night to eat the tender leaves. When this pest was first discovered, a few people were superstitious and believed it to be a "divine insect," so they burned incense and begged for "leniency," resulting in more and more insects. Upon hearing the news, the leading organs of each district immediately convened meetings of village cadres in the affected villages to carry out extensive and in-depth propaganda and mobilize the masses to capture and kill the pests. Upon hearing the news, the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute also sent personnel with medicines to Wulituo in District 19 for key prevention and control. On the same day, approximately 12 mu were sprayed with sprayers. Due to the small amount of medicine used, although some pests were killed, the effect was not significant. The District Committee of the district attached great importance to this issue and vigorously mobilized the masses to capture the pests. On the same day, 74 farmers participated, and in 75 minutes, they cleared the pests from 78 mu of land. Initially, when the masses captured this insect, they held a stick in one hand to gently strike the wheat leaves and a basin in the other hand to collect the insects that were knocked down. Later, some people felt that this method was too clumsy, so they changed to using a winnowing basket, running and pushing along the wheat tips, and most of the insects were shaken into the winnowing basket, and then killed. This method was immediately accepted and adopted by the masses. In Sanjiadian, Gaojing and other three villages in District 19, more than 350 young people, women, and children captured more than 100 jin on April 25th alone, greatly increasing the masses' confidence in capturing insects and sweeping away superstitious ideas. Upon receiving the news, the Suburban Committee issued a notice to each district on April 26th to adopt this method universally. According to experiments, the first push with the winnowing basket can capture two-thirds of the pests. After half an hour, push again, and after two or three consecutive times, all the pests can be completely eliminated.
    The method for controlling insects in irrigated wheat fields is to hoe first and then irrigate. After the soil is hoeed loose, the insects are buried in the soil. Once the water is poured, the clay hardens and the insects die in the soil.
    In order to prevent the spread of insect pests, the Suburban Work Committee of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued another emergency notice on April 28th, pointing out that the use of winnowing baskets to capture pests must be voluntary and combined, capturing in one's own wheat fields, generally in groups of five or six people; it is imperative to avoid hundreds of people from the whole village rushing together, not distinguishing whose wheat field it is, as this not only reduces the efficiency of capture, but also easily damages the wheat seedlings. The notice finally pointed out that the biggest obstacle to capturing pests at present is the ideological paralysis of certain cadres, the indifferent bureaucraticism, or the mentality of simply relying on superiors and scientific institutions. The notice called on all comrades to mobilize urgently and fight to lead the peasants to eliminate all pests. (This draft is a comprehensive rewrite based on contributions from the Suburban Committee, Han Yu, Dong Siliu, Zhou Jican, the government of District 19, Wang Zhenzhong, Ding Xueze, Ma Yuankui, Wang Fu, Ouyang Junhan, Li Zhenlu, Gao Yunzhong, Wang Zhengmin, Dai Liqun, Niu Susheng, and the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute.)
    [Reported by this newspaper] On April 16th, plum psyllid (commonly known as sticky worms or caterpillars) pests were discovered on crabapple trees in Chezhan Street, Chengzizhen, District 20 of Beijing Suburbs. At a mass meeting on pest control convened by the Town Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in the town, an effective pesticide was developed by studying the use of white lime, cigarette butts, calcium carbide lime, and black flue glaze mixed with water and heated. The worms cannot move once they touch it. In the past, farmers only knew how to catch insects by hand and had no other methods. After this pesticide was made, it increased farmers' confidence in pest control. (Chang Liang)

### 郊区农民大力除虫害  簸箕兜捕法很有效已被广泛采用

　　郊区农民大力除虫害
    簸箕兜捕法很有效已被广泛采用
    【本报讯】京郊十三、十四、十六、十七、十九、二十等区五十四个村庄的麦田中，于上月二十日先后发现麦叶蜂（幼虫）虫害，为害面积约五千余亩。各村农民在各区人民政府及中共区委会领导下，已开始加紧捕杀。十三区关东店、十九区五里坨农民创造的簸箕急推麦苗兜捉捕杀法，已被很多地区农户仿效使用。截至上月二十八日的统计，上述各区已组织了八千零十五人，共捕虫二千一百余斤。麦叶蜂俗名“齐头虫”或“夜到虫”，长约七、八分，为黑褐色肉虫。此虫繁殖极快，白日隐藏于麦根下松土烂草中，入夜爬上麦苗吃嫩叶。当初发现此害虫时，还有少数群众迷信，认为是“神虫”，因此就烧香求“饶”，结果愈来愈多。各区领导机关闻讯，立即召集受灾各村干部开会，进行广泛深入的宣传，动员群众进行捕杀。华北农业科学研究所闻讯后，亦派员携带药品，到十九区五里坨进行重点防治。当天用喷雾器喷射约十二亩。因用药量较少，虽有一部害虫致死，但收效不大。该区区委会十分重视这个问题，大力发动群众动手捕捉。当天有农民七十四人参加，七十五分钟即清扫了七十八亩地里的虫害。起初群众捕此虫时，一手持棍轻击麦叶，一手持盆收集被击落的虫子，后来，有人觉得此法太笨，即改用簸箕，顺麦梢边跑边推，虫子受震，大部落入簸箕中，然后杀死。此法立即为群众接受、采用。十九区三家店、高井等三村，三百五十余青年、妇女、儿童，仅二十五日一天即捕捉一百余斤，大大提高了群众捕虫信心，扫清了迷信思想。郊委会得讯，于上月二十六日将此法通报各区，普遍采用。据实验，用簸箕第一次推过，可捕捉三分之二的害虫，隔半小时后再推一次，连续两、三次，即可全部肃清。
    在水浇麦地治虫办法是先耪后浇。土耪松后，虫被埋土中，水一浇，黏土结成硬块，虫即僵死土中。
    为防止虫害蔓延，中共北京市委郊区工作委员会四月二十八日再度发出紧急通报，指出用簸箕兜捕害虫，必须是自愿结合，在自己的麦田上捕捉，一般以五、六人一组为宜；切忌全村数百人一起，不分谁家麦田一拥而过，如此不仅捕捉效率低，且易踏伤麦苗。通报最后特别指出：目前捕捉害虫的最大阻碍，是某些干部的思想麻痹，漠不关心的官僚主义，或单纯依靠上级及科学机关的心理。该通报号召全体同志紧急动员起来，为领导农民肃清全部害虫而斗争。（此稿系根据郊委会及寒玉、董四留、周际参、十九区政府、王振忠、丁学泽、马元奎、王富、欧阳俊汉、李振鲁、高云忠、王政民、戴力群、牛甦生、华北农业科学研究所等来稿综合改写。）
    【本报讯】京郊二十区城子镇车站街，四月十六日发现海棠树上有害虫梅蛅蟖（俗称黏虫或毛虫）。在该镇中共镇委会召集的防治害虫的群众座谈会上，研究出一种利用白石灰、烟梗、电石灰、黑烟釉加水煮热后治虫的有效药剂，虫子一触即不能活动。过去农民只知用手捉虫，无其他方法。此药剂制出后，提高了农民治虫信心。（常亮）
