　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 19th: The Kaifeng branch of the state-owned China Department Store Corporation of Henan and the Kaifeng branch of the China Egg Products Company are using methods such as ordering, commissioned processing, purchasing, and consignment sales of finished products to help private industrial and commercial enterprises, which are beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihoods, overcome their current temporary difficulties. In the past half-month, the Henan Department Store branch has successively provided assistance to the leather, weaving, leather goods, soap, matches, hardware, and electrical materials industries in Kaifeng through ordering, commissioned processing, and purchasing finished products. The types of goods ordered include leather suitcases, soap, towels, and matches; processing involves entrusting weaving factories to weave cotton yarn into fabrics and towels. The Department Store branch purchased over 130 million yuan worth of goods from the hardware and electrical materials industries. The Kaifeng Egg Products Company signed a contract with the private Xinmin Egg Products Factory, entrusting the factory to process 85 tons of egg products from April 20th to June 20th. Simultaneously, the Henan branch of the People's Bank of China also resumed acceptance of drafts and lending operations on the 11th and 12th to facilitate the turnover of funds for private industries. Due to the assistance of state-owned trade and banking departments, the temporary difficulties faced by some private industrial and commercial enterprises have begun to be gradually resolved. For example, the Xinmin Egg Products Factory had more than 160 employees in March and was only processing 70,000 eggs per day due to capital and sales issues. After being assisted by the Kaifeng Egg Products Company through commissioned processing, the number of employees increased to 280, and the daily egg processing increased to 170,000 to 175,000. More than 20 leather industries, whose production had stagnated in the past due to lack of sales channels, have become active after the Department Store branch placed orders.

    大力扶植私营工商业     
    若干厂商暂时困难已获解决
    【新华社开封十九日电】开封市国营中国百货公司河南分公司及中国蛋品公司开封分公司正以定货、委托加工、收购、代销成品等方式，扶助有利于国计民生的私营工商业渡过目前暂时的困难。半月以来，河南百货分公司已先后对开封市皮革、织布、皮件、肥皂、火柴、五金、电料等业，进行了定货、委托加工和收购成品等扶助。定货种类有皮箱、肥皂、毛巾、火柴等，加工则以棉纱委托织布厂代织布匹和毛巾。百货分公司向五金业电料业收购的货物达一亿三千多万元。开封蛋品公司与私营新民制蛋厂签订了合同，委托该厂自四月二十日至六月二十日代制蛋品八十五吨。同时，中国人民银行河南省分行营业部亦于十一、十二两日恢复押汇和放款业务，以利于私营工业资金的周转。由于国营贸易、银行部门的扶助，部分私营工商业面临的暂时困难，已开始逐步获得解决。如新民制蛋厂在三月间职工有一百六十多人，因资金和销路关系，每日只打蛋七万枚，经开封蛋品公司以委托加工方式加以扶助后，职工增至二百八十人，每日打蛋增至十七万至十七万五千枚。过去因没有销路而生产陷于停顿的二十多家皮革业，经百货分公司定货后，生产已转向活跃。
