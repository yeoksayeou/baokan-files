　　Fifth Anniversary of the Victory over German Aggressors
    Xie Lejin, Representative of the Soviet Union's Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries in China
    This manuscript is a report by Comrade Xie Lejin, Representative of the Soviet Union's Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries in China, at the "Victory over Germany Day" commemoration jointly organized by the Beijing Branch of the Soviet Union's Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Beijing Sino-Soviet Friendship Association on May 8th.

    Comrades! Today, the Soviet people and the people of all New Democratic countries are commemorating the fifth anniversary of the Soviet people's historically significant victory over German Fascism and its accomplices.

    During the more than thirty years of the Soviet state's existence, our people have repelled two military attacks by imperialists against our Soviet state.

    Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people waged fierce struggles against imperialists such as Germany, Britain, France, the United States, and Japan, as well as against the counter-revolutionary forces of the shattered Russian bourgeois landlords, in order to safeguard the independence of their country and ensure the peaceful development of the national economy and the construction of socialism in the young Soviet state from 1918 to 1920.

    On June 22, 1941, the fate of the young Soviet Republic faced a new and arduous test when Hitler's Germany, acting on the intentions of British and American imperialists, attacked the Soviet Union.

    Hitler's Germany actively prepared for war against the Soviet Socialist state. As Comrade Stalin said on November 6, 1944: "It must be admitted that in this war, Hitler's Germany and its Fascist army are a more powerful, cunning, and experienced enemy than Germany and its army in any previous war. In addition, it should be added that the German army was able to utilize the productive forces of almost all of Europe and the considerable armies of its vassal states in this war."

    German Fascists, at the instigation of British and American imperialists and their accomplices, harbored fantasies of ruling the Slavic peoples, ruling the Soviet workers, peasants, and intellectuals.

    The minor achievements of German imperialists in Western and Southeastern European countries went to their heads.

    Hitler's generals proclaimed a crusade against the Soviet Union, and in their imagination, all of Eurasia and the Americas were already at their feet. The ruling classes of Britain, the United States, and France expressed sympathy for their plans, and they became increasingly confident about the Western front and increasingly prepared for a bloody war against the Soviet people.

    As you all know, from the first day of the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia, the world has been divided into two camps—the socialist camp and the imperialist camp. The struggle between these two camps constitutes the important content of modern history. The fierce hatred of imperialists and their lackeys for the socialist system and the Lenin-Stalin cause is the program of their entire lives.

    The more successful the socialist construction of the Soviet state, and the more the workers of all countries demonstrated the great superiority of the Soviet socialist system in the face of the capitalist system, the greater their hatred became.

    Their fierce hostility was very abrupt when the inevitable contradictions of capitalism became more acute. As early as the Sixteenth Party Congress, Comrade Stalin said: "Every time the contradictions of capitalism begin to intensify, the bourgeoisie turns its eyes to the Soviet Union, and they want to find a way to solve the contradictions of capitalism or other contradictions in the Soviet Union, because the existence of this Soviet system state, this sole state as a fortress of revolution, has a revolutionary influence on the working class and colonies, it hinders the creation of new wars, it hinders the desire to redistribute the world through war."

    Under the leadership of the Lenin-Stalin Party, the Soviet people have never forgotten the threat of war from the imperialists. In the decade before the Great Patriotic War—in 1931—Comrade Stalin told the Soviet people: "We are fifty to one hundred years behind the advanced countries. We must cover this distance within ten years, or we will be overthrown."

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Soviet people accomplished this task. During the years of the Stalin Five-Year Plans, the following industrial sectors were re-established: the ferrous metallurgy industry as the foundation of industrialization, the tractor industry, the automobile industry, the aviation industry, the chemical industry, as well as machine tool manufacturing and modern agricultural machinery manufacturing, and so on.

    In the thirteen years from 1928 to 1940, compared with 1913, the smelting of pig iron almost increased fourfold, steel increased four and a half times, coal mining increased five and a half times, and oil increased three and a half times. The income of the people increased from 21 billion rubles to 128 billion rubles, and the total industrial production increased from 16 billion rubles to 138.6 billion rubles. During the years of Soviet power, 364 new socialist cities were established in the country. Thus, we can see from these figures that in the ten years or so of the Soviet Five-Year Plans, whether in terms of production technology or development speed, it had surpassed the major capitalist countries. In a short period of time, the Soviet Union became the most advanced, independent, and self-reliant industrial power, and a strong material foundation for active national defense was established.

    On the morning of June 22, 1941, Fascist Germany faithlessly invaded the Soviet Union, and British and American imperialists did not conceal their joy. On June 24, 1941, the New York Times published a statement by the current US President Truman, stating: "If we see Germany win, then we will help Russia, and if Russia is going to win, then we will help Germany, so that they kill each other as much as possible." And the opinion of the British imperialists was expressed by the then British Air Force Minister, Balba Zhong, who declared: "For the British Empire, the best result of the war on the Eastern Front is that the Soviet Union and Germany are both defeated and injured, so that Britain can occupy a dominant position."

    Why did the United States and Britain form an anti-fascist alliance with the Soviet Union in World War II? This was because of the demands generated by the hatred of the broad masses of people for fascism, this was a manifestation of the sympathy of the world's workers for the Soviet Union, and the British and American governments were afraid of becoming defenders of Hitler in the eyes of the people, so they had no choice but to enter the alliance against Hitler.

    Another very important reason is that the British and American monopoly capitalists were worried that the Soviet Union would be able to defeat Fascist Germany on its own strength, liberate the enslaved people of Europe, and thus squeeze out the British and American leadership in Europe. What the so-called "allied countries" cared about was not providing genuine assistance to the Soviet people to defeat Fascist Germany and its vassals. If we recall the opening of the second battlefield, then we are completely clear about what the British and American imperialists were seeking.

    The second battlefield was opened three years after the German army attacked the Soviet Union, and when the main force of the German army had been defeated by the Soviet army.

    Hitler's Germany's faithless attack on the Soviet Union put the Soviet Union in a very difficult situation. A powerful and cruel enemy threatened the very survival of the Soviet state.

    Fascist Germany began its military offensive against the Soviet Union, relying on the human and material resources of the Europe it occupied, and relying on the open sympathy and secret support of reactionaries around the world.

    In order to defeat Fascist Germany and eliminate the crisis for our country, it was necessary to arouse the spiritual and material strength of the Soviet people. In a very short period of time, the life of the whole country should be transformed into a wartime state, and the mode of construction in peacetime should be transformed into the mode of work under wartime conditions. The administration of the country was handed over to the Defense Committee, and everything was led by the great Stalin in this committee.

    Fascist Germany unexpectedly launched an offensive against the Soviet Union with its best one hundred and seventy divisions. The Soviet army was engaged in fierce defensive battles, and under duress, retreated into the interior. At that time, the threat to our country was very serious.

    In his historically significant speech on July 3, 1941, Comrade Stalin explained to the people that the war against Fascist Germany and its allies was not an ordinary battle between two armies, but a national liberation war waged by the Soviet people for freedom and independence, and for the defense of the achievements of socialism. Comrade Stalin said: "The purpose of this national war of liberation against the Fascist oppressors is not only to eliminate the current crisis in our country, but also to assist all the nations of Europe under the persecution of German Fascism."

    The lofty and progressive goal of the Soviet Great Patriotic War was in harmony with the interests of the broad masses of people around the world.

    Love for the socialist motherland and hatred for the enemy inspired the Soviet working class to establish heroic labor achievements. Under the call of the Party and Comrade Stalin, the Soviet working class rose up to fight against foreign invaders. A large number of workers left factories and mines to join the army, and their parents, wives, brothers, and sisters took their places in the factories. These new cadres of the working class quickly mastered the technology of production and became quite capable technicians. Workers launched patriotic movements in various enterprises, and this movement, under the slogan of "not only work for ourselves, but also work for comrades on the front line," became a powerful mass movement.

    All of this was the decisive condition for the socialist industry to continuously increase the speed of production of wartime necessities in order to carry out a difficult war. During the war years, a total of 2,250 factories and enterprises were established in eastern Soviet Union, and they all participated in production work.

    The war caused serious damage to our country's agriculture, but the great vitality of the collective farm system and the patriotic spirit of the Soviet peasants enabled the Soviet state to overcome all difficulties. At that time, in eastern Soviet Union, both the grain sown area and the sown area of industrial crops had been expanded. In 1942, the grain sown area in the east had increased by 30 percent.

    Soviet intellectuals also carried out selfless and dedicated work to consolidate national defense and support the front lines, and their work was no less than that of the working class and peasants. Our scientists and designers created various new types of machines, tanks, artillery, and aircraft.

    Comrade Stalin gave a high evaluation to the patriotic activities carried out by Soviet intellectuals during the war, saying: "Soviet intellectuals have carried out loyal work for the cause of national defense, they have continuously improved the equipment of the Red Army, improved the technology and organization of production, and they have helped workers and collective farm members to improve industry and agriculture, and have continuously advanced Soviet science and culture under wartime conditions."

    Relying on the growing economic and political assistance of the Soviet Union, and after giving the German army major blows in Moscow, Leningrad, Stalingrad, Orel-Kursk and other battle lines, the Soviet army, before the beginning of 1945, occupied the attack preparation position for the decisive battle, preparing to attack the life center of Hitler's Germany. The Soviet army had the task of overcoming a large number of enemies with strong resistance.

    Hitler continued to hold the main force of his army on the Soviet-German battlefield, using 220 divisions on the battlefield against the Soviet army, while at that time, the German army had only 75 divisions on the battlefield against the British and American armies.

    On January 12, 1945, the Soviet army began its powerful offensive. Thousands of artillery pieces and mortars destroyed the German army's strong defenses. The Soviet army broke through the enemy's defense line everywhere, and the Soviet army rapidly advanced, and by mid-April 1945, it had prepared the final decisive blow against Berlin.

    All Soviet troops, from the front-line commanders to the privates, were fully aware that this final battle would be particularly fierce. The German high command set up three defensive zones between the Oder River and Berlin, and these zones were penetrated by strong intermediate defensive lines. Hitler concentrated three-quarters of his entire army to resist the Soviet offensive.

    Comrade Stalin's call to "hoist the victory banner high above the city of Berlin" expressed the heartfelt desire of every Soviet soldier and aroused an unprecedented surge of offensive emotions.

    On April 23, 1945, the Soviet army began its offensive against Berlin, and fierce street battles were fought in the capital of Fascist Germany for ten days. On April 30, the Soviet army occupied the German Reichstag. Soviet soldiers Yegorov and Kantaria hoisted the victory banner on the roof of the Reichstag. On May 2, 1945, the Berlin garrison surrendered, and more than 300,000 German soldiers and officers were captured. The fall of Berlin determined the end of the war in other battlefields.

    Fascist Germany capitulated, and on May 8, 1945, the representatives of Hitler's supreme command signed the unconditional surrender treaty.

    The tense and arduous struggle lasted for almost four years and finally ended victoriously. The Soviet people and its armed forces defeated Fascist Germany and eliminated its army. The struggle between the two major systems of capitalism and socialism finally resulted in the victory of the socialist system.

    On May 9, 1945, on the all-people day of remembrance of the victory over Germany, Comrade Stalin said to the Soviet people: "The great sacrifices we have suffered for the freedom and independence of the motherland, the countless hardships and difficulties our people have experienced during the war, and the intense labor dedicated to the altar of the motherland in the rear and on the front lines, have not been in vain, and the result is a complete victory over the enemy."

    The working people of all countries in the world, having experienced the disasters of World War II, look at the socialist country with deep gratitude and love, looking at its heroic army, these armies have rescued Europe from Fascist enslavement and rescued Asia from the hands of Japanese militarists. They see in the Soviet state a reliable fortress for defending peace.

    Five years ago, the storm of the threat of war had disappeared, but the British and American imperialist war-mongers have not stopped their dirty work, and they are again attempting to lead mankind into a terrible vortex of war.

    But we all know that history is created by ordinary people, by the workers of the earth, who do not need war. The ranks of defending peace led by the Soviet people are growing day by day.

    For a lasting and just peace, for the friendship of all peoples, their stern voices warning the new warmongers are becoming louder and more powerful. Now the great Chinese people have joined the ranks of defending peace, and the strong pillar of world peace is the indestructible friendship between the two great peoples of China and the Soviet Union.

    Long live world peace!

    Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the outstanding son of the great Chinese people, and the advanced fighter fighting for peace and democracy!

    Long live Comrade Stalin, the leader and teacher of the working people of the world!

　　击溃德国侵略者五周年纪念
    苏联对外文化协会驻中国代表  谢列金
    此稿系苏联对外文化协会驻中国代表谢列金同志于五月八日在北京苏联对外文化协会北京市中苏友好协会联合主办“对德胜利日”纪念会上的报告。
    同志们！今天苏联人民和所有新民主主义国家的人民，来纪念苏联人民具有历史性意义地战胜德国法西斯和他的同谋者的五周年。
    在苏维埃国家存在的三十多年里，我们人民已经击退了帝国主义者对我们苏维埃国家的两次军事袭击。
    苏联人民在列宁和斯大林领导下，曾经和德英法美日等帝国主义者，以及和被粉碎的俄国资产地主阶级的反革命力量，进行了激烈的斗争，这样才在一九一八——一九二○年，守护住了自己的国家的独立，并且保障了年青苏维埃国家国民经济的和平发展和社会主义的建设。
    一九四一年六月二十二日，年青的苏维埃共和国的命运，临到了新的艰难的考验，当时希特勒德国实行了英美帝国主义者的意图，进攻了苏联。
    希特勒德国对苏维埃社会主义国家积极地准备了战争，一九四四年十一月六日斯大林同志曾经说过：“应该承认，在这次战争中希特勒德国和它的法西斯军队，比过去历次战争中的德国和它的军队更为强大、狡滑和有经验的敌人，此外还应该再加上德军在此次战争中得以利用几乎整个欧洲的生产力量和它的各附庸国家的相当巨大的军队”。
    德国法西斯在英美帝国主义者和他们的同谋者的嗾使下，抱有统治斯拉夫民族、统治苏联工人农民和知识分子的幻想。
    德国帝国主义者在西欧和东南欧各国中的轻微成就，就冲昏了他自己的头脑。
    希特勒的将军们，扬言要向苏联作十字军的进军，在他们的想像中，整个欧亚和美洲已经在他们的脚边上了。英美法的统治阶级，对他们的计划表示同情，他们对于西战场愈加放心了，而对苏联人民作流血战争的准备，愈加具有信念。
    各位都知道，从俄国伟大十月社会主义革命的第一天起，在全世界上就分成了两个阵营—社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营。这两个阵营之间的斗争，构成了现代历史的重要内容。帝国主义者和他们的奴仆们，对于社会主义制度和列宁—斯大林事业的凶暴憎恨，是它们整个生活的纲领。
    当苏维埃国家社会主义建设愈有成绩，各国的劳动者在资本主义制度面前示威，愈显出苏维埃社会主义制度的伟大优越性，他们的憎恨也愈加增大。
    当资本主义不可避免的矛盾更形尖锐化时，他们的凶暴敌意，是很唐突的。还在第十六次党代表大会上斯大林同志已经说过：“每一次当资本主义矛盾开始尖锐化时，资产阶级就把自己的眼光放到苏联身上，他们想把资本主义的矛盾或者其他各种矛盾都想在苏联身上得到解决的办法，因为这个苏维埃制度国家，这个作为革命堡垒的惟一的国家的存在，使工人阶级和殖民地受到了革命的影响，它阻碍了创造新战争，它阻碍了想以战争来进行重分世界。”
    苏联人民在列宁——斯大林党的领导下，从来没有忘记过来自帝国主义者方面的战争威胁。在伟大卫国战争的前十年——在一九三一年时，斯大林同志曾经对苏联人民说过：“我们比各先进的国家落后五十以至一百年，我们应当在十年以内，跑完这段距离，或者是我们作到这一点，或者就是我们会被人打翻”。
    苏联人民在共产党的领导下，达成了这个任务，在各次斯大林五年计划的年代里，重新建立了以下的这些工业部门：工业化基础的黑色冶金工业、拖拉机工业、汽车工业、航空工业、化学工业，以及车床制造和现代化的农业机器制造等等。
    在一九二八到一九四○的十三年里，和一九一三年相比较，生铁的熔炼，几乎增加了四倍，钢增加了四倍半，煤炭的开采量增加了五倍半，石油增加了三倍半。人民的收入从二十一万万卢布，增长到一百二十八万万卢布，工业总生产量从十六万万卢布，增长到一百三十八亿六千万卢布。在苏维埃政权的年代里，国内建立了三百六十四座新的社会主义城市。这样说来，我们从这些数字上可以看出，在苏联各次五年计划的十多年里，无论是在生产技术方面，或者是在发展速度方面，都已经超过了各主要的资本主义国家。苏联在暂短的期间里，变成了最先进的独立自主的工业强国，积极国防的强大物质基础，已经创立了。
    一九四一年六月二十二日那天的早晨，法西斯德国不守信义地侵犯了苏联，而英美帝国主义者并没有隐蔽了自己的喜悦。一九四一年六月二十四日，纽约太晤士报发表了美国现任总统杜鲁门的声明，声明里说：“如果我们看到德国战胜，那末我们就帮助俄国，如果俄国将要战胜的话，那末我们就帮助德国，这样一来，让他们彼此死的人愈多愈好”。而英国帝国主义者的意见，由当时英空军部长巴尔巴钟的话语里已经表现出来，他曾经宣称：“东战场的战争，对大英帝国来讲，最好的结果是苏德两败俱伤，这样英国才能够占有统治的地位”。
    为什么美国和英国在第二次世界大战中和苏联结成了反法西斯同盟呢？这是因为广大人民群众憎恨法西斯而产生的要求，这是全世界的劳动者同情于苏联的表现，况且英美政府，恐怕自己在人民的面前变成了希特勒的保卫者，所以不得已才进入了反对希特勒的同盟。
    另外还有一个相当重要的原因，就是英美的垄断财阀们耽心苏联能够以自己本身力量击溃法西斯德国，解放欧洲被奴役的人民，因而把英美在欧洲的领导事业排挤出去。所谓“同盟国”所关怀的并不是对苏联人民予以真正的帮助，借以击溃法西斯德国和他的附庸。如果我们追忆开辟第二战场的事，那末我们就完全清楚了英美帝国主义者的企求是什么了。
    而第二战场，是在德军进攻苏联三年以后，并且德军主力已经被苏军击溃的时候，才被开辟了。
    希特勒德国对苏联不守信义的攻击，使苏联陷入了很艰险的境地，强大而惨酷的敌人，威胁了苏维埃国家本身的生存。
    法西斯德国开始武力进攻苏联，是依赖着他所占领的欧洲的人力上和物质上的富源，是依赖着全世界反动分子公开的同情和暗中的支援。
    为了击溃法西斯德国，以求消除对我们国家的危急，必须要把苏联人民精神上和物质上的力量激奋起来。应该在极短的期间里，把全国的生活改造成战争状态，从和平时期建设方式，转入战争条件下的工作方式。国家的行政移交给国防委员会来管理，在这个委员会里由伟大的斯大林领导着一切。
    法西斯德国出人意料地以他最优秀的一百七十个师团向苏联采取了攻势，苏联军队进行着激烈的防御战，在不得已的情况下，退进了腹地。那个时候我们国家所受的威胁是很重大的。
    一九四一年七月三日斯大林同志在他具有历史性意义的演说里，解释给人民说：反对法西斯德国及其盟国的战争，并不是寻常两军的交战，而是苏联人民为自由独立、为保卫社会主义的成就而进行的全民解放战争。斯大林同志曾经说过：“这个反对法西斯压迫者的全民卫国战争的目的，不仅是为了消除我国当前的危机，并且是为了援助在德国法西斯迫害下的所有欧洲各民族”。
    苏联伟大卫国战争的高上而进步的目的，是和全世界广大人民群众的利益相融洽的。
    对于社会主义祖国的热爱和对于敌人的憎恨，鼓舞了苏联的工人阶级，建立了英勇的劳动功绩，苏联工人阶级，在党和斯大林同志的号召下，起来和外国侵略者来斗争。一大部分的工人，离开了工厂和矿井去参军，他们的父母妻子兄弟姊妹来接替他们在工厂的工作，这些工人阶级的新干部，很快就精通了生产的技术，而成了相当能干的技工。工人们在各企业中展开了爱国运动，这运动在“不仅要为自己工作，并且要为走上火线的同志工作”的口号下，变成了强大的群众运动。
    这都是社会主义工业，为了进行艰难的战争，一直在增加战争必需品生产速度的决定性的条件。在战争的年代里，在苏联东部总共建立了两千二百五十所工厂企业，并且它们都参加了生产工作。
    战争使我们国家的农业蒙受了重大的损害，但是集体农场制度的伟大生命力和苏联农民的爱国精神使苏维埃国家得以克服一切的困难。那个时候在苏联东部，无论是谷物播种面积，或者是工业用农产物的播种面积，都已经扩大了。在一九四二年，东部的谷物播种面积，已经增大了百分之三十。
    苏联的知识分子为了巩固国防和支援前线，也进行了忘我献身的工作，他们的工作并不次于工人阶级和农民。我们的科学家和设计者创造了各种新型的机器、战车、火炮和飞机。
    斯大林同志对于苏联知识分子在战争期间所进行的爱国活动，给予很高的评价，他曾说：“苏联知识分子为了祖国的国防事业，进行了忠诚的工作，他们不断地改善了红军的装备，改善了生产的技术和组织，他们帮助了工人和集体农场场员们，提高了工业和农业，在战时的条件下使苏联的科学和文化不断地向前推进。”
    苏联军队依赖了苏联增长着的经济上和政治上的协助，在莫斯科、列宁格勒、斯大林格勒、奥略尔库尔斯克和其他各战线给予德军以重大打击以后，在一九四五年开始之前，占领了决战的攻击准备位置，准备攻击希特勒德国的生命中心。苏联军队负有克服坚强抵抗的庞大数量敌人的任务。
    在苏德战场上希特勒继续掌握着自己军队的主力，在对苏军的战场上使用了二百二十个师团，而在那个时候，德军在对英美军的战场上，仅有七十五个师团。
    一九四五年一月十二日苏军开始了自己的强大攻势，几千门大炮和迫击炮，摧毁了德军的坚强防御。苏军在各处突破了敌人的防线，苏军急速地向前进攻，到一九四五年四月中旬的时候，已经准备了对柏林的最后终结的打击。
    所有苏联军队，从战线司令官到列兵，都完全清悉这最后的一战，将要特别激烈。德国统帅部在奥节尔和柏林之间设置了三个防御地带，并在这些地带之间，穿贯着坚强的中间防御线，希特勒把自己所有军队的四分之三集中起来，来抵御苏军的攻势。
    斯大林同志的“把胜利旗帜高悬在柏林城上”的号召，表现了每个苏联战士的衷心愿望，引起了前所未有的攻击情绪的激动。
    一九四五年四月二十三日，苏军开始了对柏林的攻势，在法西斯德国的首都，进行了十天的激烈巷战，四月三十日苏军占领了德国国会议会大厦。苏军战士耶果洛夫和干达利亚在该议会大厦的屋顶挂上了胜利的旗帜。一九四五年五月二日，柏林守卫部队投降了，三十余万德军士兵和军官被俘了。柏林的陷落，决定了其他各战场战事的终结。
    法西斯德国屈膝了，一九四五年五月八日希特勒最高统帅部的代表，在无条件投降的条约上签了字。
    紧张而艰难的斗争几乎继续了四年，终于胜利地结束了。苏联人民和他的武装力量击溃了法西斯德国，并且消灭了他的军队。资本主义和社会主义两大制度的斗争，终于社会主义制度获得了胜利。
    一九四五年五月九日，在战胜德国的全人民纪念日里，斯大林同志对苏联人民说：“我们为了祖国的自由和独立所遭受的重大牺牲，在战争期间我们人民所经历的无数艰难和困苦，在后方和在前方献给祖国祭坛上去的紧张劳动，并不是白费的，结果是完全战胜敌人了”。
    世界各国的劳动人民，体验了第二次世界大战的灾祸，深深地以感谢和爱戴的眼光注视着社会主义国家，注视着它的英勇的军队，这些军队从法西斯的奴役里拯救出来了欧洲，从日本军阀手中拯救了亚洲。他们在苏维埃国家里看到了保卫和平的可靠的堡垒。
    五年以前战争威胁的风暴已经消逝了，但是英美帝国主义战争贩子，并没有停止了自己的肮脏的工作，他们又企图把人类导入可怕的战争漩涡里。
    但是我们都知道，历史是被普通人们，地球上的劳动者所创造的，他们不需要战争，苏联人民所领导的保卫和平的行列，一天天地增长着。
    为了持久公正的和平而进行英勇的斗争，为了所有人民的友谊，他们警告新战争贩子的严厉声音，愈加响亮，愈加有力。现在伟大中国人民加入了保卫和平的行列，世界保卫和平的强大支柱就是中苏两个伟大人民不能破毁的友谊。
    愿全世界和平万岁！
    伟大中国人民优秀的儿子，为和平、和民主主义而斗争的先进战士——毛泽东同志万岁！
    全世界劳动人民的领袖和导师——斯大林同志万岁！
