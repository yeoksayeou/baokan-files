Xinhua News Agency, New York, 22nd Dispatch: TASS reports that the opening ceremony of the 15th Congress of the Uruguayan Communist Party took place on the 18th in the municipal square of Montevideo. Nearly six thousand laborers, holding banners and flags calling for the struggle for peace and national independence, came to welcome the delegates attending the congress.

The chairman first invited Arismendi, the secretary of the Montevideo Provincial Party organization, to stand and read the telegram of congratulations from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union amidst thunderous applause and cheers for Comrade Stalin. The telegram read as follows:

“The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union sends fraternal greetings to the 15th Congress of the Uruguayan Communist Party. We wish the Communists and all working people of Uruguay victory in the struggle for the unity of the working class and the close alliance of the working class and toiling peasants, in the struggle for Uruguayan sovereignty against the conspiracies of foreign imperialists, and for the cause of peace against the instigators of a new war. Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Suslov (signed)." While the telegram of the Central Committee of the CPSU was being read, bursts of cheers erupted with renewed vigor: "Long live Stalin! Long live the Soviet Union - the banner of peace! Long live the Communist Party of the Soviet Union!" Telegrams of congratulation from the Communist and Workers' Parties of Poland, Bulgaria, France, Italy, Britain, Spain, the United States, Colombia, Paraguay, Cuba, and the Socialist Unity Party of Germany were also read at the meeting.

Braga, representing the Brazilian Communist Party, paid tribute to the congress. He said: The Brazilian people will never fight against the Soviet Union and the people's democracies. These words earned prolonged applause and cheers in praise of Prestes, the leader of the Brazilian Communist Party. The audience listened attentively to the speeches of Ghioldi, who conveyed the congratulatory telegram from the Argentine Communist Party, and Pintos, the representative of the Paraguayan Communist Party.

Gómez, the General Secretary of the Uruguayan Communist Party, delivered a speech and was warmly applauded by the audience.
