Chile - A Semi-Colony of American Imperialism
    Wu Jianheng

Chile is a long, narrow country in South America, extending 4,300 kilometers from south to north, but only averaging 175 kilometers in width from east to west, with an area of 750,000 square kilometers. The estimated population in 1948 was over 5.6 million. It is nominally one of the three great powers of South America, but in reality, it is a semi-colonial country.

Northern Chile's Atacama Desert is almost rainless. Its importance lies in its rich deposits of nitrate, copper, iron, and coal. Central Chile has moderate rainfall and is an agricultural region. The main cities, industrial areas, and four-fifths of the population are concentrated there. Southern Chile, where Chileans say it rains "thirteen months of the year," is a sparsely populated area of virgin forests, lakes, and fjords.

Chile's minerals are well-known. According to the 1949 South American Handbook, its mineral production accounts for about two-thirds of the total mineral value of South America, and minerals account for 80 percent of the country's total exports. However, those mineral deposits are only geographically Chilean; their mining rights have long been tightly controlled by American monopoly capital.

The Atacama Desert contains the world's largest nitrate deposits. Before the invention of artificial nitric acid, Chile monopolized the production of this useful raw material. However, the mining and marketing of Chilean nitrate have long belonged to a company nominally called the "British Chilean Nitrate Company," but operated by American capital.

The copper mines in the northern mountains have been mined for more than 300 years, and copper exports account for 50 percent of Chile's total exports. The American Chile Exploration Company and the Andes Copper Mining Company monopolize the copper mines in Atacama, while the Braden Copper Company, owned by Braden, a former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs, controls the copper mines in the foothills of the southern Andes in the Atacama Desert. These three major copper companies account for 90 percent of total copper production. American capitalists refuse to supply Chile with equipment to build copper smelters, preferring to ship the copper to the United States without smelting. For them, it is more profitable to keep Chile as a raw material supplier forever.

Rich oil deposits were discovered in southern Chile at the end of World War II. Under the national demand for "oil to be state-owned," President Videla repeatedly assured that he would develop it with his own capital, but he requested a loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank to develop the oil fields due to domestic financial difficulties. The Export-Import Bank refused on the grounds that the law does not allow funding for projects in which private companies are not involved, and asked Chile to find Mobil Oil Company. As a result, the oil on Tierra del Fuego in southern Chile suffered the same fate as copper and nitrate, and was controlled by foreign capital.

Iron ore production is no exception. The American Bethlehem Steel Corporation is the owner of Chilean iron mines. DuPont Chemical Trust has the South American Explosives Company in Chile.

The same is true for other economic sectors. Chile exports a large quantity of fruit, all of which is purchased by the United Fruit Company of the Boston financial group. As a result, Chilean fruit is cheaper in the American market than in its own country. American capital controls the entire Chilean economy. Even toothpaste, ties, and other items manufactured in Santiago and labeled "Made in Chile" may still be products of a company controlled by that same American capital.

Among the twenty countries in Latin America, the United States has the most investment in Chile, second only to Cuba. Before World War I, American investment in Chile was 15 million US dollars, which increased to 600 million US dollars by 1940, a forty-fold increase. From this, we can see the extent of American control over Chile.

About 40 to 45 percent of Chile's nitrate exports are shipped to the United States, and almost all copper and iron exports are shipped to the United States. About a quarter of the Chilean government's revenue comes from tariffs, which makes the national finances dependent on the United States. In recent years, the shrinking nitrate market, especially the sharp drop in international copper prices in June 1949 and the subsequent production cuts by American copper companies, has greatly impacted the Chilean economy, deepening the poverty of the people and social unrest.

If the northern mining area of Chile is the world of Americans, then the central agricultural area is the world of landowners. The central valley area from Aconcagua to Valdivia has 75 percent of its land suitable for cultivation. Agriculture is still a semi-feudal, serf-like system, which hinders the development of production. Chile's 2,800 large estates occupy 75 percent of the total land area. A large estate not far from Santiago covers 160,000 hectares, while 88,000 small farmers only own 6/1000 of the total cultivated land.

Poverty forces tenant farmers to live like cattle and horses. They work in the landowners' fields from morning to night, ten hours in winter and as long as twelve hours in summer. This is the rent they pay for their small houses and plots of land. Tenant farmers have no political rights. They have no place to complain about their grievances, because the local authorities and local tyrants are in cahoots. Until recently, tenant farmers could only elect candidates supported by the landlords during elections.

The miners working for American companies are also subjected to exploitation and abuse. The Atacama Desert does not produce grain, and food must be transported from the central region. American mine owners pay miners very low wages, some of which are only one-sixteenth of what they pay their own workers, and the goods needed by the miners are all handled by the factory. The stores opened by the company exploit the workers again. Such stores can arbitrarily raise prices, leaving workers unable to pay off their debts. Working conditions are harsh, and many mines lack even the most basic safety equipment. Workers' residences are often surrounded by barbed wire, like concentration camps.

In Santiago and Valparaíso, Chile's largest port, workers and urban poor also live years tormented by poverty. The cost of living in Chile is the second highest in Latin America, and the extent of inflation has long been described as "greater than that of many warring countries." Food prices have risen about four times compared to 1940, and the prices of other necessities have also increased significantly, while wages have not yet been adequately increased. The slums in both cities are terrible. There are many "houses with no street number," which are temporary dwellings built by workers who cannot afford to pay rent with blocks of wood and metal sheets.

Understanding Chile's economic life, it is not difficult for us to understand who is manipulating Chile's dictator President Videla behind the scenes, and it is easier to explain the reactionary policies adopted by the Chilean government in recent years.

The Chilean constitution stipulates that the president serves a six-year term. The current president, Videla, was elected in September 1946. Chile is a multi-party country, with more than ten small parties. In order to become president, Videla formulated a program of social reform and industrial development during the election and sought the support of the Popular Front composed of the Communist Party and the Radical Party. Because he received the support of progressive forces, he was elected president. Popular pressure forced him to form a coalition cabinet, which included Radicals, Liberals, and three Communist ministers.

Videla soon betrayed the people. Under the direction of American financial capital, he launched a fascist-style attack on the remaining rights of the people. Communist cabinet members were forced to withdraw from the cabinet, and the Communist Party was declared illegal. Many democratically elected legislators and officials were dismissed and persecuted. Hundreds of teachers were expelled from schools. Thousands of patriotic people were imprisoned in twenty-one concentration camps in the desolate Antarctic region. As recently as August to November 1949, the Chilean rulers used machine guns to shoot students and striking workers. The famous Chilean people's poet, known as the "conscience of Latin America," Neruda, was also exiled for opposing Videla's reactionary policies.

In international relations, the Videla government maintains American expansionist and aggressive measures. Chile unanimously agreed to the so-called "Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance" passed at the Rio de Janeiro Conference in August 1947. After the meeting, the Chilean government, according to the wishes of American imperialism, announced in October of the same year that it would sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. At the Bogota Conference in early 1948, the Chilean representative proposed that all American countries abandon neutrality and follow American imperialism in the "Cold War." In the United Nations, Chile also played many farces by carrying out American orders.

Videla's fascist policies and betrayal of the country to American imperialism have aroused opposition and protests from the people.

Although the Chilean Communist Party was declared illegal, its publications spread throughout the country. Although the powerful workers' organization, the Chilean Workers' Federation, was dissolved, the Chilean trade unions continue to fight to defend the interests of the working class. The Chilean people have also formed a new National Democratic Front to fight against Videla's dictatorial policies and strive for democracy and peace.

In mid-November 1948, in the Pisagua concentration camp in northern Chile, 500 democratic leaders went on a hunger strike to protest their imprisonment without trial and their inhuman treatment. The Videla government's reactionary policies aroused indignation among the people of the whole country, and they unanimously supported the democratic leaders. The Chilean government was forced to close the concentration camp in February of the following year, releasing party and trade union leaders.

Because of the decline of the Chilean economy and the government's measures affecting the living standards of the working people, two major strike movements were triggered last August and this January. Miners, railway workers, electrical workers, clerks, and students participated in this revolutionary movement. The suppression, arrests, and terror policies of the military police could not suppress the people's resistance to American monopoly capital and the Chilean reactionary government.

Wealthy Americans travel to Chile to spend the summer on the beaches of the central region, boating on the lakes in the southern mountains, and playing snow games on the slopes of the Cordillera. They regard Chile as an American territory. However, the Chilean people will not agree to this. The Chilean people's struggle for liberation will surely be victorious.

### 智利——美帝的半殖民地

　　智利——美帝的半殖民地
    吴健恒
    智利是南美洲的一个狭长的国家，由南至北长达四千三百公里，而东西平均宽度却仅有一百七十五公里，面积有七十五万平方公里。一九四八年估计全国人口为五百六十余万。它名义上是南美三强之一，而实际上却是一个半殖民地国家。
    智利北部阿塔卡玛沙漠几全无雨，重要性在于它蕴藏着丰富的硝石、铜、铁和煤。中部雨量适度，为农业区，主要城市、工业区以及五分之四的人口都集中在那里。南部智利人说“一年十二个月有十三个月”下雨，是一个很少人居住的处女森林、湖沿和峡江的地带。
    智利的矿产是很有名的，据一九四九年南美手册估计，它的矿业生产约达全南美矿产总值的三分之二，矿产占全国出口总值百分之八十。可是那些矿藏就只是地理上属于智利而已，它们的开采权早已为美国独占资本紧紧扼制。
    阿塔卡玛沙漠中，有着世界最大的硝石储藏。在人造硝酸法未发明以前，智利独占了这种有用的原料的出产。但是这种智利硝的开采和运销，老早就已经属于一个为美帝资本经营而名义上叫做“英国智利硝石公司”的公司了。
    北部山间的铜矿，已开采了三百多年，铜的出口占着智利全部出口值的百分之五十。美国的智利探查公司与安达斯铜矿公司，独占了阿塔卡玛的铜矿，而另一个属前任美国负责拉丁美洲事务的助理国务卿布拉顿所有的布拉顿铜矿公司，则控制着阿塔卡玛沙漠南安达斯山麓的铜矿。这三个大铜矿公司，占有着全部铜产量的百分之九十。美国资本家不肯把装备供给智利建立炼铜厂，宁肯将铜未经冶炼就运往美国去。因为对他们来说，让智利永远作一个原料供给地是更有利的。
    智利极南部于第二次世界大战末期发见丰富的石油储藏，在本国人要求“石油国有”之下，维台拉总统连续保证要以自己的资本来开发它，但以国内财政困难而向美国进出口银行乞求一笔开发油田的贷款，进出口银行以法律不许资助不准私人公司参与的计划为辞加以拒绝，而要智利去找美孚公司。结果，智利南部火地岛上的石油也就遭到了铜和硝一样的命运，受外国资本所控制。
    铁矿的出产也无例外，美国的伯利恒钢铁公司就是智利铁矿的主人。杜邦化学托辣斯在智利则有南美炸药公司。
    其他经济部门也是一样。智利出口大批水果，它们全为美国波斯顿财阀集团的联合水果公司收购，结果智利水果在美国市场上反较在本国便宜。美国资本控制着智利全部经济，即令在智京撒地亚哥制造的标明“智利制”的牙粉、领带等物，说不定也还是那一个美国资本所控制的公司的出品。
    在拉丁美州二十个国家里，美国投资除了古巴外就以在智利的为最多。在第一次世界大战之前，美国在智利的投资为一千五百万美元，到一九四○年增加到了六亿美元，增加了四十倍之巨。由此，我们就可看到美国对智利的控制达到了怎样的程度。
    智利硝的出口，约百分之四十到四十五运往美国，而铜和铁的出口几全运到美国去。智利政府岁入约四分之一从关税得来，这样就使国家财政也依靠着美国。近年来硝石市场的萎缩，尤以一九四九年六月国际铜价的巨跌、美国铜矿公司随之而减产的结果，大大地打击了智利经济，加深了人民的贫困和社会的不安。
    假如说智利北部矿区是美国人的天下，那么中部农业区就是地主们的天下了。从阿空加瓜到瓦第维亚的中部山谷区，有着百分之七十五的土地适于耕种。农业仍是半封建——农奴制度的类型，因而阻碍了生产的发展。智利二千八百个大庄园占了全部土地百分之七十五，离撒地亚哥不远的一个大庄园占地达十六万公顷，而八万八千户小农只占有全部耕地的千分之六。
    贫穷使佃农过着牛马般的生活，他们从早到晚在地主田地上工作，冬天作工十小时，夏天作工时间要长达十二小时，这就是他们为他们狭小的住屋与小块土地，所得偿付的租役。佃农们在政治上一点权利都没有。他们有苦也没处申诉，因为地方当局与土豪原是一家。直到最近佃农在选举时都只能选举地主所支持的候选人。
    为美国公司工作的矿工也是一样受着剥削和蹂躏。阿塔卡玛沙漠不产粮食，食物都得从中部运来。美国矿主付给矿工们以很低的工资，他们付给智利工人的工资有些只等于他们付给本国工人工资的十六分之一，而供给矿工们所需用品货物都由厂方包办，公司所开设的商店再剥削工人一次。那种商店可任意抬价，使工人负债还不清。工作环境恶劣，起码的安全设备在好些矿中都没有。工人住宅常以铁丝网围起来，就像是集中营一样。
    在撒地亚哥和智利第一大港法尔巴来索，工人和城市贫民也一样过着为贫穷折磨的岁月。智利的生活费用之高，在拉丁美洲数第二，通货膨胀的程度老早有人指出“比好些交战国家还要大”。食物的价格较一九四○年上涨了约四倍，其他必需品价格亦大大增涨，而工资迄未能作适当增加。两个城市的贫民区都是糟透了的。在那儿有着好些“没有门牌号码的屋子”，它们是那些无力偿付房租的工人用木块与金属板架起来的临时的住处。
    了解了智利经济生活，我们就不难明白谁在幕后操纵着智利的独裁者维台拉总统，而对智利政府近年来所采取的反动政策，也就容易解释了。
    智利宪法规定总统六年一任，现任总统维台拉是一九四六年九月选出的。智利是一个多党制的国家，小党分立至十余个。维台拉为了要当总统，在竞选时拟定了一个社会改革和产业发展的纲领，并争取共产党与急进党等组成的人民阵线的支持。因为得到了进步势力的支持，他当选了总统。人民的压力使他组成一个联合内阁，其中包括急进党人、自由党人和三个共产党的部长。
    维台拉不久就背叛了人民，在美帝财政资本指示之下，对人民残余的权利发动了法西斯式的进攻，共产党阁员被迫退出内阁，共产党被宣布为非法。好些民选的立法者和官员都被免职和受到迫害。成百的教师被逐出学校。成千的爱国人民被拘囚到荒凉的南极地带的二十一个集中营里。近如一九四九年八月至十一月期间，智利的统治者还用机关枪扫射学生及罢工工人。智利著名的人民诗人，被称为“拉丁美洲的良心”的聂鲁达氏，也因反对维台拉的反动政策而被放逐。
    在国际关系上，维台拉政府维护美国扩张主义的侵略的措施。智利毫无异议地同意一九四七年八月里约热内卢会议上通过的所谓“西半球联防公约”。智利政府于会后即根据美帝意旨，于同年十月宣布与苏联断绝外交关系。一九四八年初的波哥大会议上，智利代表就提议一切美洲国家在“冷战”中放弃中立追随美帝。在联合国中，智利也执行着美国命令扮演了好些丑剧。
    维台拉的法西斯和出卖国家给美帝的政策，引起了人民的反对和抗议。
    智利共产党虽被宣布为非法，但它的印刷品却传遍全国。强大的工人组织——智利工联虽被解散，智利的工会却继续为保卫工人阶级的利益而斗争。智利人民并组成了新的全国民主阵线，为反对维台拉的独裁政策，争取民主和平而斗争。
    一九四八年十一月中旬，在智利北部的比萨加集中营里，五百个民主领袖实行绝食抗议他们未经审判而被囚禁以及对他们的非人的待遇。维台拉政府的反动政策，引起全国人民的愤慨，他们一致声援民主领袖们。智利政府被迫不得不于次年二月封闭该集中营，释放了政党和工联领袖。
    因为智利经济的凋蔽和政府影响劳动人民生活水平下降的措施，引起了去年八月和今年一月的两次大的罢工运动。矿业工人、铁路工人，电业工人、职员和学生都参加了这种革命的运动。军警的弹压、搜捕和恐怖政策都压不住人民对美国独占资本和智利反动政府的反抗。
    有钱的美国人到智利来旅行，在中部的海滩上度夏，在南方山间的湖上泛舟，在科底来拉山坡上作雪地的游戏。他们视智利为美国属地。可是，智利人民是不会答应的。智利人民争求解放的斗争必将得到胜利。
