Chile - A Semi-Colony of American Imperialism
    Wu Jianheng

Chile is a long, narrow country in South America, extending 4,300 kilometers from south to north, but only averaging 175 kilometers in width from east to west, with an area of 750,000 square kilometers. The estimated population in 1948 was over 5.6 million. It is nominally one of the three great powers of South America, but in reality, it is a semi-colonial country.

Northern Chile's Atacama Desert is almost rainless. Its importance lies in its rich deposits of nitrate, copper, iron, and coal. Central Chile has moderate rainfall and is an agricultural region. The main cities, industrial areas, and four-fifths of the population are concentrated there. Southern Chile, where Chileans say it rains "thirteen months of the year," is a sparsely populated area of virgin forests, lakes, and fjords.

Chile's minerals are well-known. According to the 1949 South American Handbook, its mineral production accounts for about two-thirds of the total mineral value of South America, and minerals account for 80 percent of the country's total exports. However, those mineral deposits are only geographically Chilean; their mining rights have long been tightly controlled by American monopoly capital.

The Atacama Desert contains the world's largest nitrate deposits. Before the invention of artificial nitric acid, Chile monopolized the production of this useful raw material. However, the mining and marketing of Chilean nitrate have long belonged to a company nominally called the "British Chilean Nitrate Company," but operated by American capital.

The copper mines in the northern mountains have been mined for more than 300 years, and copper exports account for 50 percent of Chile's total exports. The American Chile Exploration Company and the Andes Copper Mining Company monopolize the copper mines in Atacama, while the Braden Copper Company, owned by Braden, a former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Latin American Affairs, controls the copper mines in the foothills of the southern Andes in the Atacama Desert. These three major copper companies account for 90 percent of total copper production. American capitalists refuse to supply Chile with equipment to build copper smelters, preferring to ship the copper to the United States without smelting. For them, it is more profitable to keep Chile as a raw material supplier forever.

Rich oil deposits were discovered in southern Chile at the end of World War II. Under the national demand for "oil to be state-owned," President Videla repeatedly assured that he would develop it with his own capital, but he requested a loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank to develop the oil fields due to domestic financial difficulties. The Export-Import Bank refused on the grounds that the law does not allow funding for projects in which private companies are not involved, and asked Chile to find Mobil Oil Company. As a result, the oil on Tierra del Fuego in southern Chile suffered the same fate as copper and nitrate, and was controlled by foreign capital.

Iron ore production is no exception. The American Bethlehem Steel Corporation is the owner of Chilean iron mines. DuPont Chemical Trust has the South American Explosives Company in Chile.

The same is true for other economic sectors. Chile exports a large quantity of fruit, all of which is purchased by the United Fruit Company of the Boston financial group. As a result, Chilean fruit is cheaper in the American market than in its own country. American capital controls the entire Chilean economy. Even toothpaste, ties, and other items manufactured in Santiago and labeled "Made in Chile" may still be products of a company controlled by that same American capital.

Among the twenty countries in Latin America, the United States has the most investment in Chile, second only to Cuba. Before World War I, American investment in Chile was 15 million US dollars, which increased to 600 million US dollars by 1940, a forty-fold increase. From this, we can see the extent of American control over Chile.

About 40 to 45 percent of Chile's nitrate exports are shipped to the United States, and almost all copper and iron exports are shipped to the United States. About a quarter of the Chilean government's revenue comes from tariffs, which makes the national finances dependent on the United States. In recent years, the shrinking nitrate market, especially the sharp drop in international copper prices in June 1949 and the subsequent production cuts by American copper companies, has greatly impacted the Chilean economy, deepening the poverty of the people and social unrest.

If the northern mining area of Chile is the world of Americans, then the central agricultural area is the world of landowners. The central valley area from Aconcagua to Valdivia has 75 percent of its land suitable for cultivation. Agriculture is still a semi-feudal, serf-like system, which hinders the development of production. Chile's 2,800 large estates occupy 75 percent of the total land area. A large estate not far from Santiago covers 160,000 hectares, while 88,000 small farmers only own 6/1000 of the total cultivated land.

Poverty forces tenant farmers to live like cattle and horses. They work in the landowners' fields from morning to night, ten hours in winter and as long as twelve hours in summer. This is the rent they pay for their small houses and plots of land. Tenant farmers have no political rights. They have no place to complain about their grievances, because the local authorities and local tyrants are in cahoots. Until recently, tenant farmers could only elect candidates supported by the landlords during elections.

The miners working for American companies are also subjected to exploitation and abuse. The Atacama Desert does not produce grain, and food must be transported from the central region. American mine owners pay miners very low wages, some of which are only one-sixteenth of what they pay their own workers, and the goods needed by the miners are all handled by the factory. The stores opened by the company exploit the workers again. Such stores can arbitrarily raise prices, leaving workers unable to pay off their debts. Working conditions are harsh, and many mines lack even the most basic safety equipment. Workers' residences are often surrounded by barbed wire, like concentration camps.

In Santiago and Valpara√≠so, Chile's largest port, workers and urban poor also live years tormented by poverty. The cost of living in Chile is the second highest in Latin America, and the extent of inflation has long been described as "greater than that of many warring countries." Food prices have risen about four times compared to 1940, and the prices of other necessities have also increased significantly, while wages have not yet been adequately increased. The slums in both cities are terrible. There are many "houses with no street number," which are temporary dwellings built by workers who cannot afford to pay rent with blocks of wood and metal sheets.

Understanding Chile's economic life, it is not difficult for us to understand who is manipulating Chile's dictator President Videla behind the scenes, and it is easier to explain the reactionary policies adopted by the Chilean government in recent years.

The Chilean constitution stipulates that the president serves a six-year term. The current president, Videla, was elected in September 1946. Chile is a multi-party country, with more than ten small parties. In order to become president, Videla formulated a program of social reform and industrial development during the election and sought the support of the Popular Front composed of the Communist Party and the Radical Party. Because he received the support of progressive forces, he was elected president. Popular pressure forced him to form a coalition cabinet, which included Radicals, Liberals, and three Communist ministers.

Videla soon betrayed the people. Under the direction of American financial capital, he launched a fascist-style attack on the remaining rights of the people. Communist cabinet members were forced to withdraw from the cabinet, and the Communist Party was declared illegal. Many democratically elected legislators and officials were dismissed and persecuted. Hundreds of teachers were expelled from schools. Thousands of patriotic people were imprisoned in twenty-one concentration camps in the desolate Antarctic region. As recently as August to November 1949, the Chilean rulers used machine guns to shoot students and striking workers. The famous Chilean people's poet, known as the "conscience of Latin America," Neruda, was also exiled for opposing Videla's reactionary policies.

In international relations, the Videla government maintains American expansionist and aggressive measures. Chile unanimously agreed to the so-called "Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance" passed at the Rio de Janeiro Conference in August 1947. After the meeting, the Chilean government, according to the wishes of American imperialism, announced in October of the same year that it would sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. At the Bogota Conference in early 1948, the Chilean representative proposed that all American countries abandon neutrality and follow American imperialism in the "Cold War." In the United Nations, Chile also played many farces by carrying out American orders.

Videla's fascist policies and betrayal of the country to American imperialism have aroused opposition and protests from the people.

Although the Chilean Communist Party was declared illegal, its publications spread throughout the country. Although the powerful workers' organization, the Chilean Workers' Federation, was dissolved, the Chilean trade unions continue to fight to defend the interests of the working class. The Chilean people have also formed a new National Democratic Front to fight against Videla's dictatorial policies and strive for democracy and peace.

In mid-November 1948, in the Pisagua concentration camp in northern Chile, 500 democratic leaders went on a hunger strike to protest their imprisonment without trial and their inhuman treatment. The Videla government's reactionary policies aroused indignation among the people of the whole country, and they unanimously supported the democratic leaders. The Chilean government was forced to close the concentration camp in February of the following year, releasing party and trade union leaders.

Because of the decline of the Chilean economy and the government's measures affecting the living standards of the working people, two major strike movements were triggered last August and this January. Miners, railway workers, electrical workers, clerks, and students participated in this revolutionary movement. The suppression, arrests, and terror policies of the military police could not suppress the people's resistance to American monopoly capital and the Chilean reactionary government.

Wealthy Americans travel to Chile to spend the summer on the beaches of the central region, boating on the lakes in the southern mountains, and playing snow games on the slopes of the Cordillera. They regard Chile as an American territory. However, the Chilean people will not agree to this. The Chilean people's struggle for liberation will surely be victorious.
