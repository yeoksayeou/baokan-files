　　The Beginning of a Happy Life
    Lin Hong Lu Chaoqi
    The brilliance of youth envelops the people's capital. Beside the road, the tender green leaves on the willow branches sway in the gentle spring breeze. The first "May Day" Labor Day after the founding of the People's Republic of China has arrived!
    Before such a festival that signifies that all the working people of China have become masters of their own destiny, the reporter interviewed Comrade Chen Sheng, a young lathe worker at the 70th Ordnance Factory. With an excited smile on his face, he recounted his past and present life.
    During the period of Japanese rule, Chen Sheng worked in the Longyan Iron Mine in Xuanhua. After Japan surrendered, he went to the 70th Ordnance Factory as a lathe worker. All in all, he has been doing this for several years, but in these years, he has never had a good day. When the Japanese were here, he ate coarse red sorghum flour and black beans every day. Sometimes he ate so many black beans that he could not see things clearly at night; when the Kuomintang came, life continued to deteriorate, and being beaten and bullied was the same as before. In early 1946, his wife and children were not in Beijing, and the monthly wages he earned were barely enough to make ends meet. Later, prices rose every day, and life became even more difficult. Chen Sheng recalled the situation at that time: A family of four, in addition to buying 100 catties of mixed flour, 10 to 20 catties of millet, two catties of oil, and 500 catties of coal briquettes, could only afford to eat pickles with rice. In the three years before liberation, the family did not add a single new piece of clothing.
    After the liberation of Beijing, Chen Sheng, like the entire working class, has seen his life improve. His monthly wage is 360 catties of millet. Although there were several price fluctuations last year, he did not suffer any losses because of the guarantee of the cooperative. In addition to eating coarse grains, the family can eat more than 60 catties of white flour, three catties of oil, and several catties of pork every month. Just two months after liberation, he paid off the five silver dollars he had borrowed in the past because his child was sick. In the past year or so, in addition to buying a clock and a radio, he also made two new sets of clothes for each of his children, bought a set of floral fabric, made two sets of uniforms for himself, and his wife also prepared to make two pieces of clothing, as well as two new quilts.
    Chen Sheng's past and present life is not an isolated phenomenon, but the experience of the entire Chinese working class. Like Jin Xiuqin, a female worker at the clothing factory, and He Kangzhong, a special-class model driver at the tram company, their past and present lives are the same as Chen Sheng's. Jin Xiuqin's family has seven people. Before liberation, she and her two sisters worked in the clothing factory, and their total monthly wages were only more than one hundred catties of rice. He Kangzhong's wages at that time were only enough to maintain his life for ten days, so he had to ride a pedicab before going to work every day. What is their life like today? Jin Xiuqin and her two sisters can get about 700 catties of millet a month at the clothing factory. Their family once held a happy family meeting to discuss how to allocate these 700 catties of rice to improve the family's life. The result of the first meeting was to decide to eat refined grains once every two days, and also add some clothes and utensils. In addition to living better than in the past, He Kangzhong also held his own wedding and made new cotton-padded jackets for his mother.
    Today, the lives of workers have begun to improve, and they are learning culture and technology with full confidence. Jin Xiuqin's sister, also a female worker at the clothing factory, returned from studying at the Tianjin Workers Training Class last August, and this March, she was recommended by the trade union to Renmin University for further studies. The working class of New China has embarked on a bright and happy future.

　　幸福生活的开始
    林洪　陆超祺
    青春的光芒笼罩了人民的首都。路旁杨柳枝头嫩绿叶儿，迎着春日的和风摇曳着，中华人民共和国开国后的第一个“五一”劳动节来到了！
    在这样一个表示全中国劳动人民作了主人翁的节日之前，记者访问了七十兵工厂的青年旋工陈升同志。他带着兴奋的笑脸，述说了自己过去与现在的生活。
    日寇统治时期，陈升在宣化龙烟铁矿做工。日本投降后，他到七十兵工厂当旋工。先后算起来，已有了好几年的时间，但在这些年月里，他从来就没有过过一天好日子。日本人在的时候，每天吃的是粗的红高粱面、黑豆，有时黑豆吃得多了，害得两眼在夜里连东西都看不清；国民党来了，生活继续坏下去，而挨打受气还是和已往一样。在一九四六年初，他的妻子和小孩都不在北京，而每月所赚的工资，也仅能糊口。以后物价天天高涨，那日子就更难过了。陈升回忆那时的情景时说：一家四口人，每月工资除买一百斤杂合面，一、二十斤小米，两斤油，五百斤煤球外，就只能用咸菜下饭。解放前的三年中，一家大小没有添过一件新衣服。
    北京解放后，陈升和整个工人阶级一样，他的生活已得到改善。他每月的工资是三百六十斤小米，去年虽有几次物价波动，因有合作社的保证，并没受什么损失。一家人除吃粗粮外，每月还可以吃六十多斤白面、三斤油、几斤猪肉。解放后刚两个月，他就还清了过去因孩子生病所借的五块大洋的债。一年多来除买座钟、收音机外，还给孩子们每人作了两套新衣服，买了一套花布料，自己做了两套制服，妻子也准备做两件衣服，还有两床新被子。
    陈升的过去与现在的生活，并不是一个个别的现象，而是整个中国工人阶级的遭遇。如像被服厂的女工金秀琴、电车公司的特等劳动模范司机何康仲，他们过去与现在的生活和陈升也是一样的。金秀琴一家有七口人，解放前，她姊妹三人同在被服厂作工，每月的工资总共也不过一百余斤大米。何康仲在那时所赚的工资仅能维持十天的生活，他就不得不在每天上班之前去蹬三轮车。而今天他们的生活怎样呢？金秀琴姊妹三人在被服厂一月可以拿到约七百斤小米的工资。她们一家人曾经愉快地开过家庭会议，商量如何支配这七百斤米，使全家生活改善。第一次开会的结果，就决定每两天可吃一次细粮，还可以添制一些衣服用具。何康仲则除了生活过得较过去好以外，还办理了自己的结婚喜事，并给母亲添制了新棉袄。
    今天工人的生活已开始提高了，他们正满怀信心地学习文化、学习技术。金秀琴的姊姊，也是被服厂的女工，去年八月由天津职工训练班学习回来后，今年三月，又由工会保送到人民大学深造。新中国的工人阶级已踏上了光明、幸福的前程。
