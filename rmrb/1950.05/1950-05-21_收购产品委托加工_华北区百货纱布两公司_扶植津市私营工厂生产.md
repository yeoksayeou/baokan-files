Xinhua News Agency, 15th dispatch: According to the Tianjin Daily, 14th, the North China Region Department Store and Cotton Yarn Company are vigorously assisting Tianjin private factories in promoting products and maintaining production to overcome current difficulties through methods such as purchasing products and commissioning processing.

　　In April, the North China Department Store invested 13,473,339,000 yuan in purchasing products from Tianjin private manufacturers. Among them, 9,432,298,000 yuan was directly used to support private enterprise production through methods such as consignment sales, barter, and commissioned processing, which solved the sales problems of many private industrial products. For example, the Ruixingyuanji Knitting Factory and Wenhua and Sida Stationery Factories, etc., were once on the verge of shutdown in April due to sluggish sales. After the department store purchased their products, they resumed production. Other factories, such as Dechang Gong Paint Factory and Linhua Cigarette Factory, also solved the difficulties in capital turnover due to the department store's purchase of products. In May, the department store will continue to expand the purchase of products from private factories. From the 1st to the 10th, the company has already purchased industrial products from more than 100 factories with sales difficulties, with a total value of 9.2 billion yuan, which, combined with the April figure, has reached over 22 billion yuan. In the process of acquisition, private factories generally understand the spirit of considering both public and private interests and request the department store to purchase at reasonable prices, so that both parties do not suffer losses. However, there are also individual manufacturers who do not fully understand the spirit of considering both public and private interests and only care about their own interests, demanding that the company purchase their products at high prices or have the company purchase goods that cannot be sold. For example, the Yongchang Paper Mill sold glazed paper to the department store for 100,000 yuan per ream, while the market price at the time was only 85,000 yuan.

　　In order to assist the Tianjin weaving and dyeing industry in overcoming current difficulties, the North China Cotton Yarn Company, on the basis of the original contract for processing and weaving cloth, has successively signed the fourth phase of the cloth-for-yarn processing contract with Tianjin electric weaving factories in groups since the 3rd of this month. Through this batch of processing contracts, the current difficulties in product sales and capital turnover of more than 100 weaving factories will be resolved, enabling more than 1,000 electric looms (about half of the electric looms currently in operation in Tianjin) to continue to maintain production. In order to adapt to the current economic situation and strive to expand sales under stable prices, the specifications of the processed cloth in the fourth phase of the contract have also been changed according to the principle of "reducing costs and maintaining quality." After the change, the cost can be reduced by about one-sixth compared to before, creating favorable conditions for promotion. Regarding the cloth-yarn exchange rate, the company has also given appropriate consideration to each weaving factory based on the actual situation.

    扶植津市私营工厂生产
    【新华社十五日讯】据天津日报十四日载：华北区百货和花纱布两公司通过收购产品、委托加工等方式，大力协助津市私营工厂推销产品和维持生产，以渡过目前的困难。
    四月份华北百货公司在收购津市私营厂商产品方面，共投放资金一百三十四亿七千三百三十九万元。其中通过代销、换货及委托加工等方式直接用于扶植私营企业生产的资金为九十四亿三千二百九十八万元，解决了许多私营工业产品的销路问题。如瑞兴源记针织厂及文华、四达文具厂等，四月份曾因产品滞销，一度陷于停工，经百货公司收购其产品后，已重新开工生产。其他如德昌公颜料厂、联华烟厂，也因百货公司收购产品，解决了资金周转的困难。五月份百货公司将继续扩大对私营工厂产品的收购。从一日至十日，该公司已经收购了一百多家销路有困难的工厂的工业产品，总值达九十二亿，连四月份数字已达二百二十余亿元。在收购过程中，私营工厂方面一般多能明了公私兼顾的精神，以合理价格要求百货公司收购，这样便双方都不吃亏。但也有个别厂商对公私兼顾的精神认识不足，只顾自己一方面的利益，要求公司用高价收购自己的产品或把无法推销的货物让公司收购。如永昌造纸厂卖给百货公司的有光纸，要价为每令十万元，而当时市价只不过八万五千元。
    华北区花纱布公司，为协助津市织染业渡过当前困难，在原有加工织布合同的基础上，自本月三日起陆续与津市电力织布工厂分组签订了第四期以布换纱的加工合同。通过这批加工合同，一百多家织布厂目前产品销路及资金周转上的困难将获得解决，使一千多台电力织布机（约为津市现在开工的电力机子的一半左右）得以继续维持生产。为了适应目前经济形势，争取在物价平稳中扩大销路，第四期合同中规定加工布匹的规格，根据“减低成本，保持质量”的原则亦有所改变。改变之后，在成本方面可较前减低六分之一左右，给推销工作创造了有利条件。关于布纱交换率，该公司根据实际情况，亦给各织厂以适当照顾。
