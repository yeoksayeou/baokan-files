“May Day” International Labor Day is a fighting festival for the working class all over the world to review their revolutionary strength.

Sixty-six years ago, on October 7, 1884, eight international and national labor groups from the United States and Canada held a meeting in Chicago, USA, to discuss ways to improve labor conditions through the workers' own efforts. It was decided to hold a general strike on May 1, 1886, to achieve the eight-hour work system. On May 1, 1886, a general strike broke out in various parts of the United States. In order to fight for the survival interests of the working class, workers in various cities in the United States, especially in Chicago, carried out heroic struggles. After May 1 of that year, more than 40,000 workers in the city continued to strike in order to fight for the eight-hour work system. However, the American bourgeois government openly massacred workers in Chicago. On May 3, nearly a hundred policemen fired at striking workers at the McCormick farm implement factory in the city, and many workers were killed and injured. On the evening of the fourth day, the workers held a mass meeting of more than 2,000 people to mourn the dead workers. The American anti-government again dispatched nearly 200 policemen to break into the meeting place and massacre the workers, killing four and injuring more than fifty. One month after the May 1st general strike, American workers, relying on their own strength, had already won the right to work eight hours a day for 200,000 people. Three years later, in July 1889, the International Socialist Congress held in Paris, in order to unite the working class all over the world, decided to designate May 1st of each year, which symbolizes the unity, struggle, and victory of the working class, as International Labor Day. The European working class quickly took action. On May 1, 1900, workers in countless industrial cities in Europe and the United States held huge demonstrations. Since then, May 1 has become a great festival for the working class all over the world to strive for liberation.

From 1890 to the present 61 years, the international working class has held rallies, strikes, and demonstrations every year to commemorate "May Day." Despite the fact that the governments of imperialist countries and their lackeys—labor traitors, social reformist parties, etc.—have used all means to obstruct and sabotage, the international working class still expressed its determination to liberate mankind from the shackles of capitalism in every "May Day" commemoration. The Russian working class carried out the world's first socialist revolution in 1917 and established the first socialist country of the dictatorship of the working class—the Soviet Union. The working classes of Eastern and Southeastern European countries also led and united other working people during and after World War II to establish people's democratic countries. Every "May Day," the workers in these countries commemorate International Labor Day with enthusiastic production competitions and demonstrations against imperialism. In capitalist countries, affiliated countries, colonies, and semi-colonial countries, the working class uses united action on this day every year to resist the oppression and exploitation of imperialism and its lackeys.

The first time the Chinese working class commemorated "May Day" International Labor Day was in 1921, one year after the founding of the Communist Party of China, when workers at the Changxindian of the Pinghan Railway held a demonstration. More than a thousand workers participated in this demonstration, which was led by Deng Zhongxia, a member of the Communist Party of China. Since then, the Chinese workers' movement has developed rapidly, and the strength of the working class has grown increasingly. In these 30 years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese working class, together with the Chinese people, carried out the Great Revolution, the Land Revolution, the War of Resistance Against Japan, and the People's Liberation War, and today has won the victory of national liberation. The reactionary rule of imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital, which had long oppressed our people, has been overthrown. A true people's regime has been established. The Chinese working class, in the political field, has changed from an oppressed and enslaved position to the leading class of state power; in the economic field, it directly participates in production management in public factories and enterprises, and is no longer oppressed or subjected to unlimited exploitation in private factories and enterprises. In order to consolidate the victories already won and strive for complete victory throughout the country, the working class across the country must unite more closely with the people of the whole country, overcome the current difficulties in the course of advancement and improvement, work hard to produce, practice strict economy, and achieve the goal of rapidly restoring and developing economic construction.

　　“五一”史料
    “五一”国际劳动节是全世界工人阶级检阅自己的革命力量的战斗节日。
    六十六年以前，即一八八四年十月七日，美国和加拿大的八个国际性的和全国性的工人团体在美国芝加哥城举行集会，商讨用工人自己的力量争取改善劳动条件的办法，决定于一八八六年五月一日举行总同盟罢工，以求实现八小时工作制。一八八六年五月一日总同盟罢工在美国各地爆发了。为着争取工人阶级的生存利益，美国各城市的工人，特别是芝加哥城的工人进行了英勇的斗争。在该年五月一日以后，该城四万多工人，为着争取八小时工作制而继续罢工。但美国资产阶级政府则公开屠杀芝加哥城的工人。五月三日，近百名警察向该城麦考米克农具制造厂的罢工工人开枪，工人群众被打死打伤的很多。第二天晚上，工人又举行了二千余人的群众大会，追悼死难的工友，美国反对政府又出动了近两百名警察，闯入会场，屠杀工人，打死工人四人，打伤五十余人。在五月一日同盟罢工一个月后，美国工人靠了自己的力量已有二十万人争得了一天工作八小时的权利。过了三年，即一八八九年七月，在巴黎召开的各国社会党大会为了团结全世界工人阶级，乃决定以象征工人阶级团结、斗争、胜利的每年五月一日为国际劳动节。欧洲的工人阶级迅速行动起来。一九○○年的五月一日，欧美各国无数工业城市的工人举行了巨大的示威运动。从此以后，五月一日就成为了全世界工人阶级争取解放的伟大节日。
    从一八九○年到现在的六十一年中，国际工人阶级便每年都举行集会、罢工、示威来纪念“五一”。尽管帝国主义国家的政府及其走狗们——工贼、社会改良主义的政党等——用尽一切方法来阻挠与破坏，但国际工人阶级仍然于每年“五一”纪念中表示了使人类从资本主义桎梏下解放出来的决心。俄国工人阶级在一九一七年进行了世界上第一次社会主义革命，建立了第一个工人阶级专政的社会主义的国家——苏联。东欧和东南欧各国工人阶级也在第二次世界大战期中及以后，领导和团结了其他劳动人民，建立了人民民主的国家。每年“五一”，这些国家的工人就以热烈的生产竞赛，以向帝国主义的示威游行来纪念国际劳动节。在资本主义国家、附属国、殖民地和半殖民地国家的工人阶级，则在每年的这一天，以团结的行动来反抗帝国主义及其走狗的压迫和剥削。
    中国工人阶级第一次纪念“五一”国际劳动节，是一九二一年，即中国共产党成立的后一年，平汉铁路长辛店工人举行的示威游行。参加这次示威游行的有一千多工人，领导者是中国共产党人邓中夏。自此以后，中国工人运动猛烈发展，工人阶级的力量日益壮大。在这三十年的时间中，中国工人阶级在中国共产党的领导下，与中国人民一道，进行了大革命、土地革命、抗日战争和人民解放战争，今天已经获得了全国解放的胜利。长期压榨我国人民的帝国主义、封建势力和官僚资本的反动统治，已被打倒了。真正人民政权已经建立起来了。中国工人阶级，在政治方面，已经从被压迫被奴役的地位变成了国家政权的领导阶级；在经济方面，在公营工厂企业中直接参加着生产管理，在私营工厂企业中也不再受压迫，不再受无限制的剥削了。为了巩固已得的胜利和争取全国完全的胜利，全国工人阶级要更紧密地与全国人民团结在一起，克服当前的前进中的与好转中的困难，努力生产，厉行节约，达到迅速恢复与发展经济建设事业之目的。    （新华社三十日讯）
