Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 1st (TASS dispatch): On May Day, Moscow's streets were crowded with lively and happy people. Shortly after the May Day demonstration parade, crowds of people flocked to the city's parks and thoroughfares. The festive lights shone very brightly. Everywhere, banners fluttered, bearing slogans and the May Day slogans of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). Garlands of electric lights surrounded portraits of the leaders of the Soviet people—Lenin and Stalin. "Glory to Stalin!" "Marching towards Communism!"—these words, dear to every Soviet person, glittered in the night sky. At night, Red Square and the central thoroughfare of the capital—Gorky Street—were particularly lively. At exactly 10 p.m., the first salvo of the artillery salute resounded throughout the city, and a variety of colorful fireworks lit up the night sky. Moscow fired a twenty-gun salute for May Day.
