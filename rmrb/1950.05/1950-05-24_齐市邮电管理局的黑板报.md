	The Qiqihar Postal and Telecommunications Bureau's Blackboard Bulletin
	In the Qiqihar Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, there is a blackboard bulletin that is of concern to the employees. Its layout is the same as a newspaper, with a "Main Edition" and a "Supplement." The masthead is written in colored chalk. Clear and easy-to-understand titles attract everyone to read. Sometimes, the blackboard bulletin also publishes commentaries. Some news items are followed by notes from responsible comrades within the bureau or from the editors.
	"Who has made progress?" "Who is lagging behind?" "Who has a new record?" "Who has new experiences?"... Every time the blackboard bulletin is published, employees gather around to read it. Everyone feels that it is indeed their own publication.
	The "Main Edition" of the blackboard bulletin is edited by the Labor Union's Cultural and Educational Department. It specifically publishes materials related to the central work, commends typical examples, and appropriately criticizes shortcomings. The Supplement has six sections – Employee Production, Learning, Labor Protection, Hygiene, Women, and Culture & Education – and is edited by the respective Labor Union committee members on a rotating basis. The content of the Supplement also revolves around the central tasks. A portion consists of educational short stories selected from the *Shenyang Labor Daily* and "Life Knowledge."
	When there are temporary and important tasks, the blackboard bulletin also publishes "Extra Editions."
	The blackboard bulletin relies on everyone's participation and has a broad network of correspondents. Each Labor Union group has a correspondent who, in addition to writing their own articles, is also responsible for collecting materials and helping other workers write articles. Initially, the correspondents frequently mobilized everyone to write articles; now, the workers actively seek out the correspondents to write articles, so the blackboard bulletin has a rich source of contributions. Those responsible for writing the bulletin are selected from comrades with good handwriting. Each person takes turns writing once a week, during their spare time on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday evenings. Everyone is very enthusiastic and strives for a beautiful and neat layout.
	During the New Record Creation movement, the blackboard bulletin became the main and regular tool for propaganda and mobilization. It educated the employees and promoted production. For example, Comrade Wang Zhaosheng of the Telegraph Room set a new record of processing six thousand telegrams in three months with only three procedural errors. The blackboard bulletin published this news and wrote a short commentary, pointing out that the Telegraph Room's new record was unprecedented. It proved that the saying "the Telegraph Room cannot create new records" was incorrect. The blackboard bulletin called on all departments to continue creating more new records. This news surprised everyone. After reading it, the comrades in the Mechanical Room immediately held a meeting to discuss how to create new records for reducing malfunctions. The Translation Group then also set a new record of not making any errors in a month. For example, the employees in the bureau believed that "doing administrative work cannot create new records." However, Comrade Su Chun, a cashier in the Management Section, counted 40 billion yuan in 117 days without any errors. After the blackboard bulletin published this new record, it immediately caused a sensation throughout the bureau, educated the comrades doing administrative work, and enhanced their confidence in creating. Subsequently, Comrade Zhang Xiumei created a new record of not making any errors in three months of monthly reports, and Comrade Zhu Chunyuan of the Telecommunications Section also created a new record of not making any errors in three months of monthly reports. The city's telephone system is very complex, and this record is unprecedented. The blackboard bulletin also carries out timely criticism of shortcomings in the work. For example, the Switchboard Room had many errors for a period of time. In addition to publishing critical news, the blackboard bulletin also added an editor's note to prompt the responsible comrades to pay attention and improve their work.

### 齐市邮电管理局的黑板报

　　齐市邮电管理局的黑板报
    在齐齐哈尔邮局管理局，有一块为职工们所关心的黑板报。它的编排形式和报纸一样。有《主刊》和《副刊》。报头是用彩色的粉笔写的。意义明确和文字通俗的标题吸引大家去看。有时，黑板报上还发表评论。有的消息之后，附有厂内负责同志或编者的按语。
    “谁进步了？”“谁落后了？”“谁又有新纪录出现了？”“谁又有新经验了？”……黑板报每期出刊，职工们都围着去看。大家感到它的确是自己的刊物。
    黑板报的《主刊》由工会文教部负责编辑。专门登载有关中心工作的材料。表扬典型事例；适当地批评缺点。副刊有六种——职工生产、学习、劳保、卫生、妇女、文教——由各工会委员负责编辑，轮流出刊。副刊的取材也是围绕着中心任务。一部分选载沈阳劳动日报和《生活知识》上富有教育意义的小故事。
    遇有临时重要任务时，黑板报还出“号外”。
    黑板报是依靠大家动手办的，它有广大的通讯网。每个工会小组内有通讯干事，除自己写稿之外还负责搜集材料和帮助其他工人写稿。起初，通讯干事时常发动大家去写稿；现在，工人们纷纷主动地找通讯干事写稿，因此，黑板报的稿源很丰富。负责写报的是选出来几名字迹写得好的同志。每人每周轮流写一次，在星期二、四、六的晚上业余时间写。大家都很热心，力求版面的美观、整齐。
    在创新纪录运动中，黑板报成为主要的、经常的宣传鼓动工具，它教育了职工，推动了生产。例如报务室王兆生同志创出了三个月办六千封电报，只出三个手续差错的新纪录。黑板报发表了这个消息，并写了短评，指出报务室的新纪录是空前未有的事。它证明了“报务室不能创新纪录”的说法是不正确的。黑板报号召各部门继续多创新纪录。这个消息使大家感到很惊奇，机械室同志看了之后马上开会讨论如何创造减少故障的新纪录；译电组接着也创出了一个月未出差错的新纪录。又如局内职员们认为“搞事务工作不能创新纪录”。可是经理科出纳员苏春同志在一百十七天中点款四百亿元未出错差。黑板报刊出这一新纪录后，立刻轰动全厂，教育了作事务工作的同志，增强了他们的创造信心。接着张秀梅同志创造了三个月的月报不出差错的新纪录，电信科朱纯元同志也创出了三个月月报不出差错的新纪录。市内电话非常复杂，这一纪录是空前的。对工作中的缺点，黑板报也进行及时的批评。如话务室有一个时期出差错多，黑板报除刊出批评消息之外，并加上编者按语，促起负责同志的注意，使他们改进工作。
