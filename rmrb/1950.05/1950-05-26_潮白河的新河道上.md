In Baodi's Third District, upstream on the new riverbed of the Chaobai River, seemingly endless north and south embankments are under construction. Inside the dikes, laborers come and go, carrying soil; outside the dikes, millions of hectares of wheat fields are as green as lawns, with young spikes emerging, and the large fields are covered in green seedlings. The laborers are working hard to protect this rich land. This is a great undertaking, a corner of the construction of the New China. Comrade Li Guanghan, who is responsible for organizing the lower reaches of the Chaobai River project, once held up five fingers while speaking to the laborers on the embankment, saying, "The Central People's Government has provided 50 million catties of millet to build this project, so that millions of people can eat their fill, and millions of acres of fertile land will no longer be flooded; so that tens of thousands of disaster victims can earn food through work relief and overcome the famine."

When I arrived at Lianziying Village, two li from the new dike, farmer Wang Zuotian was hoeing wheat in the garden by the village. He happily said, "Last year, the water in this high-lying land by the village was as high as the wheat. The autumn harvest was lost. This year, with this dike, we don't have to be afraid."

Walking west from Lianziying, you can reach the Xianghe labor section. The north dike is most neatly and highly built in the Fourth District, which is the district with the most severe disaster situation in Xianghe. The work efficiency of the laborers in the Fourth District is very high, with an average of 2.6 cubic meters of earth excavated per person per day. They can earn 6.4 catties of millet. The bright red glory flag, earned through model labor, flutters in the wind on the dike. Everyone on and off the dike is working hard.

Xu Rui, the "River-Digging Hero" who digs 7.5 cubic meters a day, is a name known to everyone among the more than 5,000 laborers in Xianghe. The mutual aid group under his leadership, a total of nine people, each digs more than 7 cubic meters of earth every day, earning 15 catties of millet. They said, "We were still eating bran during the New Year! If it weren't for our government, where would we get millet to eat!" This is the heartfelt sentiment of all the disaster victims.

On April 28th, the sun had already set when I arrived at the kitchen of the laborers from Huangchangpu Village, Fourth District, Tongxian County, by Zhujiapu Village. When I got there, they had just finished work and were drinking hot millet porridge, with green scallions mixed in their bowls. A farmer named Zhang Tingyu introduced their life to me: three meals a day, two meals of dry rice when working during the day, and a bowl of porridge before resting at night, averaging three catties of millet per person per day. In the past half month, he has earned more than 80 catties of millet in addition to what he has eaten. Their wages are paid by the construction office with specially made "River Worker Grain Coupons," and they collect grain at the supply and marketing cooperatives in the laborers' districts, saving the laborers the difficulty of transporting grain themselves.

Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members, as in other work, lead the masses to actively complete tasks with their exemplary actions. In Sanhe County, nearly 5,000 laborers dig an average of just over two cubic meters of earth per person per day; however, the Liu Xinzhuang labor group in the Sixth District of the county, led by Communist Party member Liu Fushan and Communist Youth League member Liu Zhenmin, averages three cubic meters per person per day. The two of them cook the food before other laborers wake up; and when everyone else is off work in the evening, they still have to carry sixteen or seventeen loads of soil. In this way, they not only motivated the entire group, but also motivated all the laborers in Majiahe and Lijiahe.

　　潮白河的新河道上
    辛拓
    宝坻三区，在潮白河新河道的上游，现在正在修建一眼望不到头的南北两道大堤。堤里是来来往往担着土的民工；堤外是千万顷碧绿如茵的麦田，麦苗已经秀出了嫩穗，大田苗也满地青青了。民工们忙碌地劳作，就是为了保卫这富饶的土地。这是一件伟大的事业，是新中国建设的一角。负责整理潮白河下游工程的李光汉同志，在堤上对民工讲话的时候，曾经伸出了五个指头，说：“中央人民政府拿出了五千万斤小米来修这个工程，为的是叫百万人民吃的饱，数百万亩良田不再受水淹没；为的是叫几万灾民能够通过以工代赈挣到粮食，渡过灾荒。”
    我到离新堤二里地的莲子营村时，农民王作田正在村边园子里锄着麦子，他高兴地说：“去年这村边高岗地里水还跟麦子一边高呢，大秋籽粒没收，今年有了这道埝可不怕了。”
    由莲子营一直往西走，可以走到香河民工工段上。北堤修的最整齐最高的是四区，这是香河灾情最严重的一个区。四区民工的工作效率很高，平均一人一天可以挖土二点六公方。可以挣到六斤四两小米。他们用模范劳动获得的鲜红色的光荣旗，在堤上迎风飘扬着。堤上堤下每一个人都在紧张地忙碌着。
    一天挖七公方半的“挖河英雄”徐瑞，他的名字在香河五千多民工中没有一个人不知道。他领导下的互助组，一共九个人，每人每天挖土都合七公方多，能挣十五斤小米。他们说：“过年还吃的是麸子呢！要不是咱政府，那里去吃小米！”这是全体灾民的衷心话。
    四月二十八日，太阳已落山了，我到朱家铺村边，通县四区黄厂铺村民工的伙房去。到那里，他们刚下工，正端着热腾腾的小米粥在喝，盆子里拌着绿生生的小葱。一个叫张廷禹的农民向我介绍他们的生活：一天三顿饭，白天干活是两顿干饭，晚上快休息了喝顿粥，一人一天摊上三斤小米。半个月来，他除了吃的已挣到八十多斤小米。他们领工资是由施工所发给特制的“河工粮票”，在民工家的所在区供销社领粮食，省去了民工自己运送粮食的困难。
    共产党员和青年团员们象在其他工作中一样，以自己的模范行动，带领群众积极地完成任务。三河全县近五千民工，每日每人平均不过挖两公方土；可是该县六区刘辛庄民工组，在共产党员刘福山和青年团员刘振民带动下，每人每天平均挖到三公方。他们两个人在别的民工还没睡醒的时候，就把饭做熟了；晚上别人都收工了，他俩还得挑上十六、七挑土。就这样不但带动了全组，而且带动了马家河、李家河的全体民工。
