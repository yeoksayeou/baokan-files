　　Great Friendship, Great Art
    A Record of the Soviet Youth Art Troupe's Musical and Dance Evening for Beijing Workers
    At nine o'clock on the evening of May Day, more than nine hundred worker representatives who had just returned from the parade gathered at the Youth Palace to attend the musical and dance evening hosted by the Soviet Youth Art Troupe for Beijing workers. When Mikhailov, the head of the Soviet Youth Delegation, and the members of the delegation entered the venue, the hall erupted with enthusiastic cheers and thunderous applause.
    The first program of the evening was a violin solo by Viktor Pikaikin. He is a student at the Gnessin State Musical College in the Soviet Union and the champion of the Prague International Violin Competition. He was so young that while people were inspired by his beautiful and moving music, they also secretly felt a sense of amazement—such a young man actually possesses such talent. The piano solo by the young Yevgeny Malinin, winner of the Warsaw International Chopin Piano Competition and the Budapest World Youth Festival Piano Competition, also gave people the same impression. Yes, such miracles of talent were completely impossible in the old society, but in the Soviet Union, this is the inevitable result of huge, organized artistic work and the full development of talent.
    The Uzbek dance by Kalia Ismanova, a famous dancer of the Uzbek Republic Opera House who was awarded the Order of Lenin, vividly and beautifully expressed the rhythm of labor. It aroused great interest among the workers. The passionate and powerful rhythm of the Gypsy dance by Susanna Zvjazhina, a famous dancer of the Soviet State Bolshoi Theatre who was awarded the Order of Lenin, the poetic realm of youth and love expressed by Lesha Struzhkova and Alexander Labavuri's classical waltz, and the lively and happy Ukrainian dance by Danilina and Sorokin, famous actors of the Pyatnitsky Folk Chorus, and the Russian folk dance by four people, all gave the audience a strong feeling. These dances express the colorful and vibrant life of various ethnic groups in the Soviet Union.
    A singer from the Soviet Bolshoi Theatre, who was awarded the Order of Lenin, sang "My Moscow." She sang: Moscow defeated all enemies, and Stalin lives in Moscow. Elizaveta and Tsaidar, singers from the Kiev State Shevchenko Opera and Ballet Theatre, sang "Two Swallows." Two swallows and a little girl lived a happy life. The fascist bandits came, and the swallows and the little girl left their home. The great Red Army liberated their hometown, and the swallows and the little girl returned. The innocent and beautiful feelings of the little girl conveyed here, and the sorrow and pain when the enemy came, deeply touched people's hearts. Jonyte Kostelicha, an actor from the Leningrad State Theatre and a winner at the All-Soviet Singing Competition, sang "A Young Communist League Member Says Goodbye to His Mother and Goes to the Frontline," and "Heroic Cossack." Kliuri, a student at the State Tchaikovsky Conservatory, sang "The Old Miller," his deep and grand voice and his humorous and lively expressions achieved great effect.
    The astonishing soft gymnastics performance by Anikin and Dashigva showed how developed sports are in socialist countries and how strong the physique of young people is.
    Each program stirred up frenzied cheers. The whole audience repeatedly demanded "Encore!" "Encore!" After the performance, when all the artists of the art troupe appeared on the stage, the worker representatives went on stage to offer flowers amidst cheers. When he reported that he represented 300,000 worker brothers in Beijing to thank the Soviet friends, the cheers were like the roaring of the sea. He shouted, "Long live Sino-Soviet friendship!" "Long live Stalin!" Soviet friends also shouted, "Long live Mao Zedong!" When a worker representative walked up to Lesha Struzhkova, she jumped up and hugged him. He also hugged her tightly. The cheers from the audience became even louder, and some people were moved to tears in the cheers.
    The great art of the Soviet youth artists, as well as their enthusiasm, kindness, and their kind and joyful figures, were deeply imprinted in the hearts of everyone who walked out of the venue; this enthusiastic and beautiful scene will forever be imprinted in everyone's hearts. The first Labor Day of the new China was truly a happy day for the worker brothers in Beijing.

　　伟大的友情，伟大的艺术
    记苏联青年文艺工作团招待北京市工人的音乐舞蹈晚会
    “五一”节晚上九点钟，九百多个刚刚游行回来的工人代表，聚集在青年宫，参加了苏联青年文艺工作团招待北京市工人的音乐舞蹈晚会。当苏联青年代表团团长米哈依洛夫和代表团的团员们进入会场的时候，会场发出了热烈的欢呼和狂风暴雨一般的掌声。
    晚会的第一个节目是维克托·毕开金的小提琴独奏。他是苏联格聂西内音乐学校的学生，布拉格国际提琴比赛的冠军。他是那样的年轻，因此，人们一面受着他那优美的动人的琴声所鼓舞的同时，人们还暗暗地感觉到一种惊异——这样青年，竟有如此天才。华沙国际萧邦钢琴比赛会和布达佩斯世界青年节钢琴比赛会得奖的年轻的耶夫哥尼·玛利尼的钢琴独奏，也给了人们以同样的印象。是的，这样的天才的奇迹在旧社会里是完全不可能出现的，但在苏联，这却是巨大的有组织的艺术工作和天才的充分发挥的必然结果。
    荣获列宁勋章的乌兹别克共和国歌剧院名舞蹈家卡利亚·依斯曼罗娃的乌兹别克舞，鲜明而柔美地表现了劳动的节奏。引起工人们巨大兴趣。荣获列宁勋章的苏联国家大剧院的名舞蹈家苏萨娜·兹娃纪娜的吉普西舞的热情而有力的节奏，莱沙·斯特鲁兹柯娃和亚力山大·拉巴屋里的古典华尔兹舞所表现的青春和爱情的诗的境界，以及毕亚蒂尼斯基人民歌舞团的名演员达妮莉娜和索罗金的活泼而快乐的乌克兰舞，四人的俄罗斯民族舞，都给了观众强烈的感动。这些舞蹈表现了苏联各民族的色彩鲜丽的、充满了活力的生活。
    荣获列宁勋章的苏联大剧院歌唱家歌唱了《我的莫斯科》。她歌唱着：莫斯科击败了一切敌人，斯大林住在莫斯科。基辅国立石夫琴科歌舞剧院的歌唱家叶利扎维达、蔡夫达尔歌唱了《两只燕子》。两只燕子和小女孩过着幸福的生活。法西斯匪徒来了，燕子和小女孩都离开了家，伟大的红军解放了家乡，燕子和小女孩又回来了。这里传达出来的小女孩的天真美丽的感情，和敌人来临时的悲哀沉痛，深深地打动着人们的心。列宁格勒国家剧院演员，全苏维埃歌唱会上获奖的歌唱家乔尼特·克斯特利查歌唱了《辞别了妈妈去向前线的青年团员》，和《英勇的哥萨克》国立柴可夫斯基音专学生克里乌里歌唱了《磨坊老人》，他的低沉而宏大的声音和他的诙谐活泼的表情获得了极大的效果。
    阿尼金和达石格瓦的惊人的柔软体操表演，显出了社会主义国家里体育是如何发达，青年们的体格是如何健壮。
    每一个节目都掀起了狂热的欢呼。全场一再地要求着“再来一个！”“再来一个！”表演结束后，当文艺工作团全体艺术家们都出现在台上来的时候，工人代表们在欢呼中上台去献花，当他报告说，他代表北京市三十万工人兄弟向苏联友人们致谢。欢呼更象是大海呼啸起来。他大叫着：“中苏友好万岁！”“斯大林万岁！”苏联友人也欢呼“毛泽东万岁！”一位工人代表走到莱沙·斯特鲁兹柯娃面前的时候，她跳起来把他拥抱住了。他也紧紧地拥抱着她。全场的欢呼于是更为高涨，有的人在欢呼中感动得流泪了。
    苏联青年艺术家们的伟大艺术，以及他们的热情、和善，他们的亲切而愉快的影子深深地印在每一个走出会场的人们的心里；这热情的美丽的场面将永远印在每一个人心里。新中国的第一个劳动节对于北京的工人兄弟们真是一个幸福的日子。
