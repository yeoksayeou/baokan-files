　　Smedley's Speech at the New York World Peace Conference
　　The Victory of the Chinese People
    Last March, more than 2,800 representatives of progressive American science, literature, and art workers held a grand "World Peace Conference of American Cultural and Scientific Circles" in New York. The chairman was the famous American astronomer Dr. Harlow Shapley. Participants included famous writers like Richard Boyle, Howard Fast, and Soviet representatives Fadeyev, Shostakovich, and Pavlenko. Since the conference was held inside the bastion of the world's reactionary camp, the warmongers of Wall Street were even more panicked and resorted to various conspiracies and sabotage tactics, but they still could not prevent the conference from proceeding victoriously. Before the closing of the conference, more than 20,000 peace-loving Americans held a mass meeting in Madison Square, unanimously shouting slogans against wars of aggression and defending world peace. This article is based on a speech by Ms. Agnes Smedley, one of the initiators of the conference, giving the highest praise and evaluation to the victory of the Chinese people. It is translated to commemorate this great friend of the Chinese people. (Translator)
    The vanguard of the liberation movements of the Asian nations is the Chinese people, and the victorious People's Liberation Army has become a shining torch for all oppressed nations in the East. This army has demonstrated its military-political strategies and tactics, its achievements, and its heroism to the nations of the East: even the most powerful imperialist countries and domestic reactionaries can still be overthrown.
    The victory of the Chinese people has shaken the foundations of imperialism, bringing China—perhaps all of East Asia—into the camp of peace, making it very difficult, even impossible, to launch a war in the Far East. For example, General MacArthur and other reactionaries had designed to transform Japan into a military base for World War III, connecting it with South Korea, Taiwan, numerous island bases, and the Chinese mainland under Chiang Kai-shek's rule. China was prepared as a source of raw materials needed to revive Japanese industry and a market for Japanese goods.
    All these plans have been shattered, and today every patriotic Chinese, regardless of belief, is a resolute opponent of our country's policy towards Japan. ...
    I have an opinion, and at the same time, I believe this is also the opinion of the majority of the delegates to this conference, and also the belief of the majority of the American people, that the best way to gain the friendship of the Asian people and help the progress of Asian events is to extend a hand of sympathy and friendship to the new forces of liberation in Asia. It is certain that Asia will never turn back; half of humanity there has been driven into the abyss of misery and poverty for more than a hundred years.
    The crowned heads of Europe once united to oppose the so-called republican scourge, which was the force that arose in the era of the American and French revolutions to replace feudalism. Our ancestors did not turn back, and today, the new Asia that has emerged, shaking off the shackles of feudalism and imperialism, will never turn back either. No conspiracy, sabotage, terror, or war will ever be able to take away the historic liberation cause that the Asian people have won after overthrowing internal and external oppressors.

　　史沫特莱在纽约世界和平大会上的讲话
　　中国人民的胜利
    去年三月美国进步科学、文学、艺术工作者代表二千八百余人在纽约举行了一个盛大的“美国文化、科学界世界和平大会”，主席是美国著名天文学家哈罗·沙勃莱博士，参加者有著名文学家里卡特·波依尔、哈华特·法斯特等和苏联代表法捷耶夫、萧斯塔柯维奇、巴甫连科等。由于大会是在世界反动阵营的堡垒里边举行，华尔街的战贩们更惊惶失措，施展了各种阴谋破坏的伎俩，但仍不能阻止会议的胜利进行。大会闭幕前，两万以上的爱好和平的美国人民在麦迪逊广场举行群众大会，一致喊出了反对侵略战争、保卫世界和平的吼声。本文是大会发起人之一史沫特莱女士在会上的发言，对中国人民的胜利给与最高的颂扬和估价。谨译出以悼念这位中国人民的伟大的友人。（译者）
    亚洲各民族的解放运动的前卫是中国人民，胜利的人民解放军已经成为东方所有被压迫民族的光辉的火炬了。这个军队已经把他的军事的——政治的策略和战术、它的战绩和英雄主义表现给东方各民族看：即使是最强大的帝国主义国家和国内反动派，也还是能够被打倒的。
    中国人民的胜利动摇了帝国主义的基础，把中国——也许是全部东方亚洲——带进了和平阵营，使在远东发动战争这件事，成为非常困难，甚至不可能。比如，麦克阿瑟将军和别的反动派们曾设计把日本转变为第三次世界大战的一个军事基地，使它和南朝鲜、台湾、许多岛屿基地和蒋介石统治下的中国大陆，连结在一起。中国被准备作为复兴日本工业所需的原料的供给地和日本商品的市场。
    所有这一切计划被粉碎了，今天不分信仰的每一个爱国的中国人是我国对日政策的坚决的反对者。……
    我有一个意见，同时，我相信这也是这个会议的大多数代表们的意见，而且也是大多数美国人民的信念，就是要获得亚洲人民的友谊和帮助亚洲的事件的进行的最好的方法，是把同情和友谊的手伸向亚洲新的解放力量。这是一定的，亚洲决不会回头走了，那儿人类的半数被驱入悲惨和穷苦的深渊已经有一百多年了。
    欧洲的戴皇冠的头子们曾经纠合起来一致反对所谓共和党的灾祸，那是在美国和法国革命时代起来代替封建主义的力量。我们的祖先没有回头走，今天挣脱了封建主义和帝国主义的枷锁而出现的新的亚洲，也决不会回头走了。无论阴谋、破坏、恐怖或者战争，将再也不能夺去亚洲人民在推翻内外压迫者后所赢得的历史性的解放事业。
