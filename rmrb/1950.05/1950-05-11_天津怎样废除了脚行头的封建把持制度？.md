　　How Tianjin Abolished the Feudal Monopoly System of the Porter Bosses?
　　By Our Special Correspondent Gu Weijin
　　　　　　I. Porter Bosses, One of the Ten Evils of Tianjin.
　　Tianjin is the largest water and land port in North China. There are many transportation industries in the city, such as dock loading and unloading, railway loading and unloading, intra-city transportation, and in-plant loading and unloading. In the past two hundred years, these transportation industries have been controlled by the feudal forces of the porter guilds.
　　There are a total of 227 porter guild units in Tianjin, including 3,302 large and small porter bosses. In order to control the transportation industry, most of the porter bosses participated in reactionary political organizations such as the Three People's Principles Youth League, the Kuomintang, the Democratic Socialist Party, and the Military Statistics Bureau, as well as feudal superstitious organizations such as the Qing Gang, the Red Gang, the Heaven and Earth Society, the Fire God Society, the Freemasons, and the Righteous Sons Society. They associated with military police, police, secret agents, and the Black Flag Team (rogue organizations engaged in plunder), and also hired unscrupulous lawyers and thugs. Ba Yanqing, the largest porter boss in the city, was a member of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Committee and a pseudo-National Assembly representative. Relying on these forces, the porter bosses did whatever they wanted. They occupied all the porter territories in the city, passed them down to their descendants, and created feudal separatism. They implemented cruel feudal exploitation of the transportation workers. Seventy, eighty, or even ninety percent of the workers' earnings were taken away by them, and some were even arbitrarily "rewarded." Some porter bosses could exploit 3,000 catties of cornmeal a day. If a worker offended them slightly, the porter bosses would threaten, "Your life isn't even worth half a day's pay to me," or even falsely accuse and assassinate them. The porter boss of Qicun, who was at odds with the worker Zhai Da, killed a worker and claimed that Zhai Da had done it, using money to buy Zhai Da's death in prison. The porter bosses forcibly transported merchants' goods and arbitrarily extorted freight; if merchants freely transported goods, they had to pay "crossing the street money," "shoulder-touching money," and "drinking money" to the porter bosses in the "jurisdiction." This kind of extortion was often higher than the hiring fee. This created an extremely unreasonable phenomenon in freight rates. When merchants' goods were loaded and unloaded at the Tianjin port, the cost was sometimes equal to 70% of the ship fare from Tianjin to Hong Kong. In order to compete for porter territory, the porter bosses often used gang relations to instigate workers to fight each other, resulting in tragic deaths. The fights were conducted by drawing lots, and those who drew the "death lot" had to kill the other party; if they failed to kill the other party, they would kill themselves, or be killed by the porter boss. In this way, the porter boss could turn around and say that they were killed by the other party, making it easier to sue the other party and win the porter territory. The porter bosses even forced workers to compete in jumping into oil cauldrons in order to compete for porter territory. Some large porter bosses who were closely connected with secret agents were even more rampant and domineering. They often didn't pay when visiting prostitutes, going to theaters, or going to bathhouses... If they were not treated well, they would beat and scold people. Some warehouses had to give the title of honorary manager to a large porter boss when they opened (because the transportation of the warehouse's goods was entirely in the hands of the porter boss, and if the relationship with the porter boss was not good, they would suffer unexpected losses). For example, when the Tonghe Xing Department Store in the Second District opened, it gave the title of general manager to the large porter boss Liu Jinshan for nothing, and also gave him two shares. In short, the crimes of the porter bosses were countless, and they were once known as one of the ten evils of Tianjin.
　　　　　　II. Overthrow the Porter Bosses, Establish Service Stations.
　　The porter bosses used this feudal hegemonic force to control the urban transportation industry, which seriously affected the exchange of materials and the development of industry and commerce; plunged the workers' lives into a deep abyss of suffering; and hindered urban security and democratic political facilities. After the liberation of Tianjin, the People's Government relied on the workers' awareness and organization to gradually abolish the feudal monopoly system of the porter bosses.
　　In March of last year, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau's Transportation Affairs Office first mobilized transportation workers in the Second and Tenth Districts to launch a struggle to abolish the porter bosses (there was more work here, more workers, and more conflicts between workers and porter bosses). The workers hated the porter bosses for gaining without working. At that time, the leadership put forward slogans such as "abolish exploitation, more work more gain, no work no gain," and combined them with the workers' own interests to quickly organize the workers and establish three service stations. Under the leadership of the Transportation Affairs Office, they undertook the government's grain transportation work (at that time, it was the early days of liberation, and the main task was to transport grain). Only 5% of the freight was extracted as the service station's management fee, and the rest was divided equally among the workers according to the number of people and vehicles. The emergence of this new labor organization without exploitation was an earth-shattering event for the workers who had suffered more than two hundred years of cruel exploitation by the porter bosses. Workers in various districts rose up to organize service stations. Eighteen service stations were established in the city's eleven districts, controlling the city's transportation industry.
　　The service stations replaced the porter guilds' business. The porter bosses desperately sabotaged and struggled. Some porter bosses organized themselves to block workers from transporting goods, and prepared a group of people who had drawn "death lots" to fight with the workers. The government actively supported the workers, convened meetings with the porter bosses, pointed out that the porter bosses' actions were wrong, and exposed the porter bosses' past crimes, suppressing the porter bosses' arrogance. Some porter bosses asked to join the service stations on the grounds that they had no food to eat (in fact, they had businesses such as auto shops and restaurants as a result of long-term exploitation of the workers), attempting to continue to exploit the workers. The workers unanimously proposed, "Whoever works eats." The government supported the workers' opinion. The porter bosses could not work, so naturally they could not join the service stations. Seeing that the Tianjin People's Government firmly supported the workers, the porter bosses came up with the whimsical idea of going to the former North China People's Government in Beijing to sue, fabricating that the workers had divided their property. The government understood the truth, and the porter bosses' lawsuit was unsuccessful. Some porter bosses used their last resort, taking out several bars of gold each and organizing scattered transportation, using low prices as a gimmick to confront the service stations. The workers unanimously proposed, "As long as the public takes care of our meals, we will work for him for three years even if we don't earn freight." The service stations responded to the porter bosses with even lower freight rates. The porter bosses could not maintain the overly low freight rates for a long time, so they had to disband. At this time, the porter bosses turned to covert struggle, using their henchmen to spread rumors and threats among the workers. However, the workers gradually raised their awareness in the struggle and ignored the porter bosses' rumors and threats. After that, more and more workers joined the service stations, the porter bosses were completely isolated, and all kinds of sabotage and struggles completely went bankrupt.
　　　　　　III. Democratic Formation, Clearing Up Camouflaged Second Porter Bosses, Establishing New Labor Organizations.
　　In July of last year, based on the needs of work development, the Transportation Affairs Office was changed to the Municipal Transportation Company to lead the eighteen service stations. At this time, a serious problem arose: a group of loafers and local ruffians, in the great movement to overthrow the porter bosses, pretended to be active, wormed their way into the service stations, and obtained leadership positions such as captain and worker representative. After the movement ended, they controlled the transportation industry like the porter bosses of the past. They were still gaining without working (more than 10% of the people in each transportation team did not work), deducting workers' wages, and embezzling for their own benefit. As a result, the workers' burden increased and their income decreased. They seized on the backward thinking that still existed in some workers and arbitrarily extorted freight. Many merchants were forced to purchase their own transportation tools, causing workers to lose their jobs. These people's style was undemocratic (such as not allowing workers to interfere in affairs), and there was a serious existence of guildism and feudal separatist thinking.
　　It is necessary to clear up this group of camouflaged second porter bosses in order to improve the workers' lives and develop the transportation industry. However, there were some gang feudal relationships between them and the workers (such as recognizing teachers and discussing seniority), and the workers had many concerns about them. The Transportation Company adopted the working principle of combining the workers' own interests, conducting patient education, winning over the majority, and attacking the minority. It moved forward steadily and implemented democratic formation. At the beginning, it was proposed among the workers to oppose gaining without working and to oppose embezzlement. It was pointed out that arbitrarily extorting freight violated the principles of mutual benefit between labor and capital and giving consideration to both public and private interests, and also violated the long-term interests of the working class. In repeated education, the workers' awareness gradually increased, and they gradually separated ideologically from the camouflaged second porter bosses and moved closer to the Transportation Company. At this time, the workers were mobilized to conduct democratic discussions and stipulate the conditions for each member. At the same time, evaluation teams were established to discuss the conditions for evaluation team members and carefully elect evaluation team members. In order to make the evaluation team members truly understand the important significance of evaluation, short-term training was conducted. After everything was fully prepared, a democratic formation conference was held. Most of the evaluation team members fully displayed the spirit of selfless dedication and repeatedly evaluated out many camouflaged second porter bosses (such as porter bosses, secret agents, local tyrants, bullies, rogues, landlords, etc.), and respectively strived to win them over, transform them, and cleanse them. In this way, the real working workers were united and the ranks of workers were straightened.
　　On the basis of clearing up the camouflaged second porter bosses, the Municipal Transportation Company began to establish new labor organizations. It unified the control of the city's transportation industry, rationally allocated the city's transportation force, and gradually broke the feudal separatist situation. It convened meetings of worker representatives and public and private enterprises, and on the basis of the principles of mutual benefit between labor and capital and giving consideration to both public and private interests, it agreed on a relatively unified and reasonable freight rate - this freight rate was 72.8% lower than the freight rate of the pseudo-Transportation Workers' Union in the past. However, because the porter bosses' 80% exploitation was first abolished and many camouflaged second porter bosses who gained without working were cleared up after the democratic formation, the workers' morale was improved and the workers' actual income was increased: before the democratic formation, the average daily income of workers was equivalent to about 13 catties of cornmeal; after the democratic formation, the average daily income of workers was equivalent to about 20 catties of cornmeal. Due to the stipulation of a relatively unified and reasonable freight rate, the bad habits of high-priced extortion and forced loading and transportation were gradually reduced, which facilitated the exchange of materials and the development of industry and commerce.
　　　　　　IV. Organize the Transportation Workers' Union, Strengthen Worker Education, and Establish a New Style.
　　Before the democratic formation, the Wharf Transportation Workers' Committee mobilized workers in various industries to establish trade unions from the bottom up, educated workers to unite and help each other, opposed guildism, opposed feudal separatism, and abided by labor discipline. In this way, the workers' awareness gradually increased, and they gradually established new ideas and a new style. For example, the 116 porter units in the Eighth District broke the boundaries of feudal separatism, uniformly allocated transportation, and formed nine transportation teams. The "territories" of the dock workers were gradually opened up: workers from the Dahua Wharf could go to the Taikoo Wharf to load and transport; workers from the Jardine Matheson Wharf could go to the Bailey Wharf to load and transport. The workers at the East Railway Station set their own discipline: abide by railway regulations, do not smuggle, and do not ask for drinking money. In order to take care of the lives of tricycle drivers, the transportation trucks took the initiative not to carry passengers. Many workers were gentle and quick when transporting and unloading goods, did not steal, did not damage, did not pocket anything they found, and were able to report smuggling. This is a new atmosphere in the Tianjin transportation industry, which powerfully assisted the Transportation Company in smoothly developing the transportation industry.

　　天津怎样废除了脚行头的封建把持制度？
    本报特派记者　古维进
            一、脚行头，天津十大恶之一。
    天津为华北最大的水陆码头。市内有不少搬运业，如码头装卸，铁路装卸，市内运输，驻厂装卸等。在过去二百余年来，这些搬运业均为脚行的封建势力所把持。
    天津全市共二二七个脚行单位，包括三三○二个大小脚行头。脚行头为了把持搬运事业，大部参加了三青团、国民党、民社党、军统等反动政治组织，和青帮、红帮、天地门、火神会、共济社、义子会等封建迷信组织。他们结交宪兵、警察、特务、黑旗队（从事掠夺的流氓组织），还雇用黑律师和打手。全市最大的脚行头巴延庆是国民党市党部委员、伪国大代表。脚行头依靠这些势力，为所欲为。他们霸占全市所有的脚行地盘，子孙世袭，造成封建割据。他们对搬运工人实行残酷的封建剥削。工人劳动所得，要被他们剥削去百分之七十、八十至九十，有的甚至由他们随意“赏与”。有些脚行头一天能剥削三千斤玉米面。工人对他们稍有触犯，脚行头轻则威胁说：“二爷用半天的钱，就买你一条狗命”，重则诬害暗杀。七村的脚行头与工人翟大不合，就杀了一个工人，硬说是翟大杀的，用钱把翟大买死狱中。脚行头强行搬运客商的货物，任意勒索运价；客商如果自由搬运货物，要给“辖区”内的脚行头出“过街钱”、“搭肩钱”、“酒钱”。这种勒索，常高于雇用费。这就形成了运价极不合理的现象。客商的货物在天津码头装卸时，所出费用有时等于天津到香港的轮船运费百分之七十。脚行头为了争夺脚行地盘，常利用帮口关系，唆使工人互相殴斗，演成人命惨剧。殴斗采取抽签办法，抽到“死签”的人，必须打死对方；如果打不死对方，就自己杀死，或由脚行头杀死。这样，脚行头就可以反过来说被对方打死，便于和对方打官司，赢得脚行地盘。脚行头甚至强迫工人比赛跳油锅，以争夺脚行地盘。有些和特务联系密切的大脚行头，更是横行霸道。逛窑子，进戏园，到澡塘，……常不掏钱。稍有招待不周，动辄打骂，有的货栈开市，还得给大脚行头一个名誉经理的头衔（因为货栈的货物搬运，完全操在脚行头手里，如果和脚行头的关系搞不好，要受到意外的损失）。如二区同和兴大货栈开市时，把正经理名义白白送给大脚行头刘金山，还给他送了两个股。总之，脚行头的罪行数不清，曾被称为天津十大恶之一。
            二、打倒脚行头，建立服务站。
    脚行头运用这种封建恶霸势力，把持城市搬运事业，严重影响了物资交流和工商业的发展；使工人生活陷入痛苦的深渊；并且妨碍城市治安与民主政治的设施。天津解放后，人民政府即依靠工人的觉悟和组织，逐步废除脚行头的封建把持制度。
    去年三月间，市公用局运输事务所在二区与十区，首先发动搬运工人，展开废除脚行头的斗争（这里活多，工人多，工人与脚行头的矛盾亦多）。工人最痛恨脚行头不劳而获。当时领导上即提出“取消剥削，多劳多得，不劳不得”等斗争口号，结合工人的切身利益，很快地把工人组织起来，成立了三个服务站，在运输事务所领导下，承揽政府运粮工作（当时是解放初期，主要就是运粮）。所得运费，只抽取百分之五为服务站的管理费，其余由工人按人和车均分。这个没有剥削的新的劳动机构的出现，对于受尽脚行头二百余年残酷剥削的工人说来，是一件惊天动地的事情。各区工人纷纷起来组织服务站。全市十一区先后建立了十八个服务站，掌握全市搬运事业。
    服务站代替了脚行的生意。脚行头拼命的破坏和挣扎。有的脚行头组织起来，拦阻工人搬运，并准备一批抽到“死签”的人，打算和工人殴斗。政府积极支持工人，召集脚行头开会，指出脚行头这种作法不对，并揭露脚行头过去的罪恶事实，压下脚行头的气焰。有些脚行头以没饭吃为理由，要求参加服务站（其实他们长期剥削工人的结果，都有买卖，如汽车行、饭馆等），企图继续剥削工人。工人一致提出：“谁劳动谁吃饭。”政府支持工人这个意见。脚行头不能劳动，自然没法参加服务站。脚行头看见天津人民政府坚决支持工人，竟异想天开，跑到北京前华北人民政府告状，捏造工人分了他们的财产。政府了解实情，脚行头告状没有结果。有些脚行头施出最后的手段，每人拿出几条金子，组织散车搬运，以低价为号召，和服务站对抗。工人一致提出：“只要公家管饭，我们不赚运费也干他三年”。服务站以更低的运价回答了脚行头。脚行头不能长期支持过低的运价，只好散伙。这时，脚行头又转入隐蔽斗争，利用爪牙，在工人中造谣、威胁。但是，工人在斗争中逐渐提高了觉悟，对于脚行头的造谣威胁不加理睬。之后，工人组织到服务站的越来越多，脚行头完全陷于孤立，各种破坏、挣扎乃完全破产。
            三、民主编队，清除化形二脚行头，建立新的劳动机构。
    去年七月，根据工作发展的需要，运输事务所改为市运输公司，领导十八个服务站。这时，发生了一个严重问题：有一批二流子及流氓地痞，在打倒脚行头的大运动中，凭着帮口关系，假装积极，钻到服务站里，取得队长及工人代表等领导职位。到了运动结束，他们像过去的脚行头一样，把持了搬运事业。他们仍是不劳而获（每个运输队有百分之十以上的人不干活的），克扣工人工资，贪污中饱。结果增加了工人负担，减少了工人收入。他们抓住某些工人还存在的落后思想，任意勒索运价。许多客商被迫自置运输工具，造成工人失业。这些人的作风不民主（如办事不许工人过问），严重存在着行会主义、封建割据的思想。
    必须清除这批化形二脚行头，工人的生活才能改善，搬运事业才能开展。但是，他们与工人之间，有着若干帮口封建关系（如认师傅，论行辈），工人对他们有许多顾虑。运输公司采取了结合工人切身利益，进行耐心教育，争取多数，打击少数的工作方针。稳步前进，实行民主编队。开始，在工人中提出反对不劳而获，反对贪污中饱。指出任意勒索运价，违反劳资两利、公私兼顾的原则，也就违反了工人阶级的长远利益。在反复教育中，工人觉悟逐渐提高，思想上慢慢与化形二脚行头分家，与运输公司靠拢。这时便发动工人民主讨论，规定每个队员的条件。同时建立评议小组，讨论评议员的条件，慎重选举评议员。为使评议员真正了解评议的重要意义，曾进行了短期训练。一切酝酿成熟，始召开民主编队大会。大部分评议员充分发挥了大公无私的精神，反复评议出不少的化形二脚行头（如脚行头、特务、土棍、恶霸、流氓、地主等），分别加以争取、改造、洗刷。这样，团结了真正的劳动工人，整齐了工人队伍。
    在清除化形二脚行头的基础上，市运输公司开始建立了新的劳动机构。统一掌握全市的搬运事业，合理调配全市的搬运力，逐渐打破封建割据的局面。召集工人代表与公、私营企业开会，本着劳资两利、公私兼顾的原则，议定比较统一的合理的运价——这个运价，低于过去伪运输工会运价的百分之七十二点八。但因先取消了脚行头百分之八十的剥削与民主编队后，又清除了许多不劳而获的化形二脚行头，工人的情绪提高了，工人的实际收入增加了：民主编队前，工人平均每日收入折合玉米面十三斤左右；民主编队后，工人平均每日收入折合玉米面二十斤左右。由于规定了比较统一合理的运价，逐渐减少了高价勒索、强装强运等恶习，这就便利了物资交流和工商业的发展。
            四、组织搬运工会，加强工人教育，树立新作风。
    在民主编队前，码头运输工人工作委员会即发动各行业工人，自下而上地建立工会，教育工人团结互助，反对行会主义，反对封建割据，遵守劳动纪律。这样，工人觉悟逐渐提高，逐步树立了新思想、新作风。如八区一一六个脚行单位，打破了封建割据界限，统一调配运输，编成九个运输队。码头工人的“行头”逐渐开放了：大华码头的工人可以到太古码头去装运；怡和码头的工人可以到百利码头去装运。东车站的工人自定纪律：遵守铁路规章，不走私，不要酒钱。运输大车为了照顾三轮车的生活，主动不拉人座。许多工人运货卸货时，轻放快运，不偷盗，不损坏，拾物不昧，并能检举走私。这是天津运输业的新气象，它有力地协助运输公司，顺利开展了搬运事业。
