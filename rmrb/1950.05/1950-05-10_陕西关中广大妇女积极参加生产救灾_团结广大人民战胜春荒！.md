Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 8th. The broad masses of rural women in the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi Province are actively participating in production, disaster relief, and the spring production movement. After liberation, through various mass movements and education in winter schools and women's literacy classes, rural women in Guanzhong have generally improved their ideological understanding. Many women have overcome backward ideas of belittling labor and relying on men, and are participating in production, disaster relief, and spring plowing alongside men. According to incomplete statistics from Weinan, Hua County, Lintong, and Tongguan counties, approximately 210,000 women (accounting for two-thirds of the total number of women in the four counties) have participated in sideline production such as spinning, transportation, weaving straw hats, and weaving bamboo products, actively fighting against the famine. For example, in Hua County, 1,640 women in District One (more than half of the women in the district) organized 260 women's spinning groups. In just over ten days, they spun more than 32,800 catties of yarn, exchanged it for 900 catties of wheat, 2,100 catties of corn, and 25 catties of cotton from the county's cooperative, thus solving their living difficulties. A transportation team composed of 110 women in the Chengguan District of Tongguan transported local vegetables and other products to Zhaocun in Shanxi Province to sell, exchanging them for sweet potatoes. In this way, the daily income per person can not only maintain the living expenses of two people, but the entire team can also save 45,000 yuan in transportation costs. In order not to miss the farming season and to complete the task of increasing grain and cotton production, women in various places actively responded to the government's call and enthusiastically participated in spring plowing, weeding, and other work. Lan Guiying, a labor model in Jiangjia Village, Weinan First Township, plowed a total of 5.8 mu of cotton fields in two days. In Chang'an County, more than 13,000 women in the county participated in exchanging labor for weeding. A women's labor exchange group of thirteen people in Xiqingmen Village, Yangshan District Second Township, weeded 35 mu of land in three days, exceeding the weeding level of ordinary male laborers. Most of the women in four townships in Weinan County also took the lead in planting more than 34,700 trees in mid-March. The leading role of women cadres in labor production is the main key to mobilizing and organizing women to participate in production. For example, Wang Hui, a women's cadre in Pingmin County, helped four women in the Second Township of Chengguan District weed six mu of wheat in one day. After that, women and farmers in the township discussed one after another, saying: "Female comrades can work hard to help us weed the land. If we don't go to the fields, we are really sorry to the government." Then, women in various villages in the township organized labor exchange groups, and old women and little girls also went to the fields to dig wild vegetables.

　　陕西关中广大妇女积极参加生产救灾
    团结广大人民战胜春荒！
    【新华社西安八日电】陕西关中地区广大农村妇女积极参加生产救灾和春季生产运动。关中各地农村妇女在解放后经过各种群众运动和冬学、妇女识字班的教育，思想认识普遍提高，很多妇女克服了轻视劳动、依赖男人的落后思想，并和男人们一样地参加了生产救灾和春耕生产。据渭南、华县、临潼、潼关等四县不完全的统计，已有约达二十一万妇女（占该四县全部妇女人数的三分之二），分别参加了纺织、运输、编草帽、编竹器等副业生产，与灾荒作积极的斗争。如华县一区妇女一千六百四十人（占全区妇女一半以上）所组织的二百六十个妇纺组，十余天中即纺线三万二千八百多斤，从该县合作社换回麦子九百斤，包谷二千一百斤，棉花二十五斤，从而解决了她们的生活困难。潼关城关区一百一十名妇女组成的运输组，将该地蔬菜等产品背到山西省的赵村去卖，换回红芋。这样每人每日所得除可以维持两个人的生活费用外，整个组还可节省运输费用四万五千元。为了不违农时和完成粮棉增产任务，各地妇女都积极响应政府号召，热烈地参加了春耕、锄草等工作。渭南第一乡蒋家村劳动模范蓝桂英，两天犁棉田共达五亩八分。长安县全县参加变工锄草的妇女有一万三千余人。该县杨善区第二乡西清门村十三个人的妇女变工小组，三天锄了三十五亩地，超过了一般男劳动力的锄草水平。渭南县四个乡的大部分妇女，并在三月中旬带头种植了三万四千七百多株树。妇女干部在劳动生产中的带头作用，是发动和组织妇女参加生产的主要关键。如平民县妇女干部王辉帮助该县城关区二乡四个妇女一天锄了六亩麦子后，该乡妇女和广大农民即纷纷议论说：“女同志都能下苦帮助我们锄地，我们再不下地，实在对不起政府。”接着，该乡各村妇女们都组织起了变工组，老婆婆、小女孩们也都下地挖野菜。
