    [Xinhua News Agency, 2nd] Combined reports from TASS and Telepress: The laboring people of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Bulgaria joyously celebrated International Labor Day.

    In Czechoslovakia, May Day demonstrations and parades were held in all towns and villages. In Prague, from early morning, hundreds of thousands of laboring people in demonstration processions flowed continuously towards the festively decorated Wenceslas Square. After President Gottwald delivered his May Day speech, the laboring people's May Day demonstration began. The procession, led by advanced workers, followed by the Young Pioneers and members of the Czechoslovak Youth League, marched across Wenceslas Square, reviewed by President Gottwald and leaders of the Communist Party and the government. Colorful banners and slogans expressed the will and determination of the Czechoslovak people to defend peace, their boundless love for the Soviet Union, and their unyielding efforts to advance along the road of socialist construction.

    In Budapest, the capital of Hungary, more than 600,000 laboring people participated in the May Day demonstration. The procession held high flags expressing solidarity with the working class around the world, opposing imperialism and warmongers, and celebrating the achievements of the May Day labor competition in Hungarian factories. The demonstration lasted for seven hours.

    In Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, an unprecedentedly grand May Day parade began with May Day salutes. Three hundred thousand Sofia citizens marched past the Dimitrov Mausoleum. Standing on the platform of the mausoleum were Prime Minister Chervenkov, ministers of various government departments, and delegations from various People's Democracies and Italy. During the parade, white doves of peace flew in the sky. The marchers carried many placards with charts illustrating the strengthening of the peace camp and the weakening of the warmongers' forces, demonstrating the determination of the laboring people to complete the Five-Year Plan in four years. One of the most moving slogans was: "Every labor victory is a victory in the struggle against the warmongers." The newspapers in the Bulgarian capital published special May Day editions and announced the Council of Ministers' decision to reduce the prices of certain major food items by 35 percent.

    [Xinhua News Agency, 1st] TASS, Warsaw, 1st: The grand meeting in Warsaw commemorating International Labor Day was held on April 30th.

The people of the whole world regard the Soviet Union as the pillar of peace, Moscow as the capital of the world, and Stalin as the leader of all those who fight for peace.
