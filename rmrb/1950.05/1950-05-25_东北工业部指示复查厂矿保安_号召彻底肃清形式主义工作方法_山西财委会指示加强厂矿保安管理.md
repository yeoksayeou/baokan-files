[Shenyang News] Northeast Daily reports: On May 13th, the Northeast Industrial Department issued another instruction to its affiliated units regarding a "universal security review." This instruction requires leaders at all levels to examine the actual implementation of security work and security responsibility systems in their affiliated factories and mines with a spirit of self-criticism. It calls for overcoming the "unfinished" work attitude and formalistic work methods. The factories and mines under the Northeast Industrial Department have already achieved considerable results in the general security inspection in April. However, some industrial and mining enterprises, due to a lack of attention to the inspection work, have allowed the security inspection and the newly established security responsibility system to become a mere formality. For example, Mechanical Plant No. 1 did not pay attention to security work and improper operation methods damaged a brand-new Soviet lathe that had been in operation for less than two months. Although the Shiren and Zhaizi mines under the Tonghua Coal Mine had undergone three security inspections, many violations of technical operations and security regulations still occurred. These facts prove that overcoming formalism in security inspection work remains an important issue.

[Taiyuan News] Shanxi Daily reported on the 21st: In order to strengthen the safety work of factories and mines, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government Financial and Economic Committee issued an instruction to its affiliated units on May 5th, requiring them to add necessary safety equipment and mobilize employees to further strengthen safety management in light of the specific circumstances of their units, and establish regular machine maintenance and various safety systems. Since the major security inspection conducted last winter, state-owned factories in Shanxi have generally paid attention to security work, and the awareness of the vast number of employees in protecting the property of the motherland has also been enhanced compared to the past. However, individual units continue to experience accidents due to insufficient attention paid to security work by leading comrades. For example, at the Jincheng Coal Mine on February 26th this year, three workers were killed due to gunpowder burning at the bottom of the kiln; and a fire broke out in the No. 2 wellhead warehouse of the Xishan Coal Mine, resulting in significant losses. Therefore, further strengthening security management remains a very important task at present.

　　东北工业部指示复查厂矿保安
    号召彻底肃清形式主义工作方法 
    山西财委会指示加强厂矿保安管理
    【沈阳讯】东北日报消息：东北工业部于五月十三日，再次向所属各单位发出“普遍进行保安复查”的指示。这个指示要求各级领导干部，必须以自我检讨的精神，严正地检查所属厂矿保安工作及保安责任制的实际执行情形。克服“有头无尾”的工作态度和形式主义的工作方法。东北工业部所属各厂矿，在四月份的普遍保安检查中，已经获得不少成绩。若干工矿企业由于没有重视检查工作，使保安检查及新树立的保安责任制流于形式。如机械一厂不注意保安工作，操作方法不当，损坏了运转不到两个月的全新苏联车床，通化煤矿所属石人、砟子等矿，虽经三次保安检查，仍发生了许多违犯技术操作及保安规程的事件。这些事实证明，克服保安检查工作中的形式主义，仍是一个重要的问题。
    【太原讯】山西日报二十一日消息：为了加强工厂矿山的安全工作，山西省人民政府财政经济委员会于五月五日向所属各单位发出指示，要求他们增设必要的安全设备，并发动职工联系本单位具体情况，进一步加强安全管理，建立机器定期检修及各种安全制度。山西各公营工厂自去冬进行保安大检查后，一般的已经注意了保安工作，广大职工爱护祖国财产的认识，亦较前提高。个别单位由于领导同志对保安工作重视不够，仍不断发生事故。如晋城煤矿于今年二月二十六日，因窑底火药燃烧，牺牲三个工友；西山煤矿二号井口仓库失火，损失甚大。因此，进一步加强保安管理，仍为当前非常重要的工作。
