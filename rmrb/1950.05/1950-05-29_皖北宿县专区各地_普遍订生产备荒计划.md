　　Production and Famine Relief Plans Universally Established in Various Areas

　　[Northern Anhui News] The Su County Special District of Northern Anhui is continuing to implement production for disaster relief and production for famine preparedness, launching a movement to brainstorm ideas, make plans, calculate carefully, and formulate plans for a concentrated spring plowing effort and sustained long-term sideline production.

　　Since last winter, the special district's production and disaster relief work has involved lending over 120 million catties of various grains. After four months of arduous struggle by Communist Party and People's Government cadres at all levels, they led the masses in actively engaging in production for self-reliance and mutual social assistance to overcome the famine. However, before May 1st, new floods occurred in Si County, Lingbi County, and Su County, inundating over 2 million mu of wheat and affecting spring plowing, with only two-tenths of the planting completed. This created a continuous and long-term severe famine in the heavily affected areas. Therefore, in the Su County area, it is not only necessary to prevent the summer famine but also to continue to persist in sideline production and carry out production for disaster relief. A concentrated spring plowing effort to complete spring planting is particularly important. However, cadres and the masses generally have pessimistic thoughts of "disaster relief without end" and ideas of "relaxing a bit" and "taking a break."

　　The CCP Su County Prefectural Committee and the Su County Commissioner's Office, upon discovering the above situation, under the guidance of Zeng Xisheng, Secretary of the CCP Northern Anhui Regional Committee, and Liu Jingfan, Deputy Director of the Central Inspection Group, first convened a meeting of responsible cadres from Wuhe, Si County, Lingbi, Sihong, and Su County on May 1st, explaining that production for disaster relief and production for famine preparedness should be planned for the long term. Each county then formulated plans for a concentrated spring plowing effort to rush plant sorghum, beans, and vegetables, and persist in sideline production based on its actual conditions. Each county district also held meetings of district and township cadres to convey the spirit of the Lingbi meeting, emphasizing collective deliberation, less mention of difficulties and more brainstorming, more planning, more careful calculation, and the formulation of plans. Lingbi, under the leadership of Comrade Li Renzhi, Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, convened a meeting of district secretaries, women cadres, and township heads and farmer representatives from twenty-five heavily affected townships on the 7th to discuss plans for mobilizing 4,000 people to spin yarn and 30,000 people to move within the county to reclaim wasteland and rush plant 400,000 mu of spring land. Detailed plans were also formulated by township. Comrades Zeng Xisheng and Wu Yunpei, Deputy Secretary of the Prefectural Committee, first helped Tianji Township in Sihong County formulate a year-round agricultural sideline production plan. This plan, on the one hand, specifically calculated the living needs before the summer harvest based on the total population and labor force of the entire township, and formulated methods for continuing to engage in sideline production or conducting relief to enable the people of the entire township to overcome the spring famine. On the other hand, it formulated an agricultural production plan based on labor, livestock, and land area. Vigorous efforts were made to mobilize farmers to plant late autumn crops (such as soybeans, mung beans, etc.) and agricultural subsidiary products (such as pumpkins, etc.) before the summer harvest. The characteristic of this plan is that it is formulated based on general production conditions and the lowest annual output. As long as it can be gradually implemented, the township, although currently a heavily affected area, can not only prepare for famine in the future but also advance towards production and prosperity. Comrade Wu Yunpei used this plan as a demonstration report at the county committee and cooperative cadre meeting, and the thirty-odd townships present all followed the Tianji Township plan, combined with the actual conditions of their own townships, to formulate comprehensive and thorough plans. The six districts of Xuefeng and others in western Sihong convened a district cadre meeting on the 15th to specifically discuss the concentrated spring plowing effort and persistence in sideline production. On the same day, the cooperative also held meetings of district cooperative cadres to discuss how to complete the new construction of twenty boats and the repair of five hundred boats on schedule, lend out agricultural implements, sort out accounts, expand and improve cooperative organizations, and how to attract the masses to invest and run cooperatives well in the future, and long-term support for mass production and other plans.

　　After each county inspected spring plowing, solved difficulties, and formulated plans, they made every effort to rush spring planting. In the ten days of rush planting, a total of 5 million mu of spring land was cultivated and planted, accounting for eight-tenths of the total spring land area in the district. By the 10th of this month, the production plans of each county, district, and township had been largely completed. At present, cadres in the heavily affected areas are both helping to formulate plans door-to-door and helping to complete the plans.

### 皖北宿县专区各地  普遍订生产备荒计划

　　皖北宿县专区各地
    普遍订生产备荒计划
    【皖北讯】宿县专区为继续贯彻生产救灾与生产备荒，掀起想办法、做打算、算细账、订突击春耕、坚持副业长期生产计划运动。
    该专区生产救灾工作，从去冬到现在，贷放各种粮食达一亿二千余万斤，经共产党、人民政府各级干部四个月艰苦奋斗，领导群众积极生产自救与社会互济度过灾荒。但在五月一日前，泗洪、灵璧、宿县等县发生新的水灾，不仅淹掉二百余万亩麦子，春耕也受雨水影响只种十分之二，造成重灾区连续性、长期性的严重灾荒。因此，在宿县区不仅要预防夏荒，而且还要继续坚持副业开展生产救灾。突击春耕完成春种尤属重要。但干部、群众较普遍存在“救灾无底”的悲观思想与“松松气”“歇歇劲”思想。
    中共宿县地委、宿县专署发现上述情况，在中共皖北区党委书记曾希圣与中央视察组刘景范副主任指示下，先于五月一日召开五河、泗县、灵璧、泗洪、宿县五县负责干部会，说明生产救灾与生产备荒要作长期打算。各县即根据本县实际情况订出突击春耕抢种秫豆菜蔬，坚持副业生产计划。各县区又分别召开区乡干部会议，传达灵璧会议精神，强调集体打谱、少提困难多想办法、多做打算、多算细账、订计划。灵璧于七日在地委书记李任之同志领导下，召开各区区书、妇干及二十五个重灾乡乡长与农民代表会议，讨论计划发动四千人纺纱，三万人在本县内移居开荒抢种四十万亩春地，又以乡为单位订出详细计划。曾希圣及地委副书记吴云培同志首先帮助泗洪县田集乡订出全年农业副业生产计划。这个计划一方面根据全乡所有人口及劳力数，具体计算了夏收前生活所需，订出了如何继续从事副业生产或进行救济的办法，以便使全乡人民都能度过春荒。在另一方面又根据劳畜力和土地面积，制定农业生产计划。大力动员农民在夏收前点种晚秋作物（如黄豆、绿豆等）及农业附属生产物（如南瓜等）。这个计划的特点是依一般的生产状态以及最低年产数量制订的。只要能够逐步实施，该乡在目前虽是重灾区，今后却不但可以生产备荒，还可进而生产致富。吴云培同志在该县县委及合作社干部会议上，拿这个计划作了示范报告，到会三十余乡都照着田集乡计划的订法，结合本乡的实际情况普遍而周密的订了计划。泗洪西部雪枫等六个区又于十五日召开区干会议，专门讨论突击春耕与坚持副业问题；同日合作社也开各区社干会议，讨论如何按期完成新制二十条船与修理五百条船、贷放农具、整理账目、扩大与健全合作社机构、今后怎样吸收群众入股办好合作社、长期支持群众生产等计划。
    各县检查春耕解决困难、订出计划后，全力突击春种，十天抢种中，共完成五百万亩春地的耕种，占全区春地面积十分之八。本月十日前各县区乡生产计划已大体订完，现各重灾区干部正一面挨门逐户帮订计划一面去帮助完成计划。
