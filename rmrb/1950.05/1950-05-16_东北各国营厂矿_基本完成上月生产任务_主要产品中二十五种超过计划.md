Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 14th: State-owned factories and mines in Northeast China have basically completed their production tasks for April. Among the thirty-four major products, twenty-five exceeded their targets; among them, fifteen exceeded their targets by more than 20%, and three exceeded their targets by more than 50%, with cement exceeding the most. Among the nine products that did not meet their targets, iron ore, open-hearth steel ingots, raw coal, and electricity generation all reached more than 90% of the original plan.

During the April production, the workers in various factories and mines enthusiastically carried out production competitions to welcome "May Day"; a large number of cadres also responded to the call of the Ministry of Industry to "face the factories and mines, and go deep into the factories and mines" to inspect the work. These are the main reasons for achieving the above results. The Shenyang No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, which had failed to complete its tasks in the first quarter and whose finished products were all substandard, completed its production tasks two days ahead of schedule in April and improved its quality after Gao Gang, Chairman of the Northeast People's Government, personally went to the factory to inspect and give instructions. Workers at the Shenyang No. 5 Machine Tool Factory proposed creating new quality records as a "May Day" gift in early April. Each class and group launched challenges against each other to strive for first-class products. As a result, twenty-nine out of the thirty planers produced were first-class products, and only one was second-class.

　　东北各国营厂矿
　　基本完成上月生产任务           
　　主要产品中二十五种超过计划
    【新华社沈阳十四日电】东北国营各厂矿已基本完成四月份生产任务。在三十四种主要产品中超过任务者有二十五种；其中超过任务百分之二十以上者有十五种，超过百分之五十以上者三种，其中水泥超过最多。在未完成任务的九种产品中，铁矿石、平炉钢锭、原煤、发电等亦均达到原计划的百分之九十以上。
    在四月份生产中各厂矿工人们曾热烈地进行了迎接“五一”的生产竞赛；大批干部也响应工业部“面向厂矿、深入厂矿”的号召，深入厂矿检查工作，这些是达到上述成绩的主要原因。第一季度未完成任务、而制出的成品亦全部不合规格的沈阳第一机器厂，经东北人民政府高岗主席亲赴该厂检查并予指示后，四月份提前两天完成了生产任务，质量亦有提高。沈阳第五机器厂工人曾在四月初提出创造质量新纪录作为“五一”献礼，各班、组都为争取一级品互相展开挑战；结果制出的三十部平铣床中有二十九部是一级品，只有一部是二级品。
