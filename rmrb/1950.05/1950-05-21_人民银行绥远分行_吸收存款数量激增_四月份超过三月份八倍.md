Xinhua News Agency, Gui Sui, 19th: The Suiyuan Provincial Branch of the People's Bank of China exceeded its deposit absorption task for April. In addition to fulfilling its assigned quota, the branch also deposited 6 billion yuan in cash with the head office. According to statistics from Gui Sui and Baotou alone, the number of deposit accounts in April increased by more than double compared to March. The Gui Sui branch's business department saw its deposit amount in April exceed March's by eight times. All public enterprises and institutions, military units, and other organizations in Gui Sui and Baotou have deposited their cash in the bank. The serious phenomenon of cash hoarding and waste has been overcome. For example, the Suiyuan Military Region's Supply Department used to keep an average of over 4 billion yuan per month for expenses and transfers; now, it only keeps 300 to 400 million yuan for daily expenses, depositing the rest in the bank. The bank has also achieved excellent results in absorbing idle social capital. For example, in the Baotou branch, private deposit accounts accounted for 82% of all deposit accounts, and the amount of deposits was more than double that of military, government, and public enterprise institutions.

    吸收存款数量激增
    四月份超过三月份八倍
    【新华社归绥十九日电】人民银行绥远省分行超额完成四月份吸收存款任务。该分行除上缴任务外，并缴存总行现金六十亿元。四月份存款户仅归绥、包头两市统计，较三月份即增加一倍以上。该行归绥分行营业部四月份存款额超过三月份八倍。归绥、包头两市全部公营企业及机关、部队等单位，都已将现金存入银行。现金搁置浪费的严重现象已克服。如绥远军区供给部过去每月平均留四十余亿以备开支、调度，现在只留三、四亿元作日常开支，其余全数交存银行。该行在吸收社会游资方面亦获优良成绩。如包头支行全部存款户中，私人存款户占百分之八十二，存款数字较军政机关及公营企业机构多一倍。
