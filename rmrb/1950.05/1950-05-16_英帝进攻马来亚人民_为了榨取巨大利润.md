Xinhua News Agency, 15th: According to a report in the Bombay progressive newspaper "Crossroads" regarding Britain's "total war" against Malaya: one need only look at the huge profits that British imperialism extracts from Malaya to understand why Britain is suppressing the rising national liberation movement of the Malayan people.

	The capital of British rubber and tin companies in Malaya is estimated at approximately 100 million pounds. In the past two years, the profits of twenty British tin companies have increased from £919,609 to £1,444,213. The profits of the British "Dunlop Rubber Company" have increased from £9,116,000 in 1947 to £10,768,000 in 1948.

	The dollars obtained by British colonialists from rubber and tin in Malaya are more than the dollars obtained by the United Kingdom from all its export trade.

　　英帝进攻马来亚人民
　　为了榨取巨大利润
    【新华社十五日讯】据塔斯社引孟买进步报纸《十字路报》关于英国对马来亚进行“总体战”的报道称：人们只要看一看英帝国主义从马来亚所吸取的巨大利润，就不难知道英国为什么要镇压马来亚人民日益高涨的民族解放运动。
    英商在马来亚开设的橡胶公司和锡矿公司，资本估计约达一亿英镑。过去两年来，英商二十家锡矿公司的利润已从九一九、六○九英镑，增至一、四四四、二一三英镑。英商“邓禄普橡胶公司”的利润，已从一九四七年的九、一一六、○○○英镑增至一九四八年的一○、七六八、○○○英镑。
    英国殖民者从马来亚的橡胶与锡所获得的美元，要比不列颠联合王国从全部出口贸易中所获得的美元还要多。
