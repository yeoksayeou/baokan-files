What is the area and population of Hainan Island?
Which hand is used for the Young Pioneers salute?
    Regarding the inconsistency in the figures for the area and population of Hainan Island in the "Introduction to Hainan Island" (Xinhua News Agency稿) published in this newspaper on April 21st and in this newspaper's editorial "Celebrating the Victory of Landing on Hainan Island," many readers have written to inquire about this matter. The reason for this issue is primarily due to shortcomings in our editorial work. When quoting figures in the editorial, we did not notice the several different numbers, nor did we compare it with the Xinhua News Agency稿 when sending the manuscript. After discovering the error, we were unable to make a correction because we found three or four different versions of the area and population of Hainan Island, and we were unsure which one was correct. According to recent materials from various sources, the more accurate figures are as follows: The area of Hainan Island should be over 34,000 square kilometers, and the population should be over 3 million. The "Introduction to Hainan Island," which stated the area as over 58,000 square kilometers, was incorrect, and Xinhua News Agency corrected this in a telegram on May 3rd. This newspaper's editorial stating the area as over 40,000 square kilometers and the population as over 2 million was also incorrect.
    The Young Pioneers salute should be given with the "right" hand. This newspaper mistakenly stated the left hand in one instance, which was also due to oversight in our editorial work. This newspaper already made a correction on April 30th. Because many readers are still writing to inquire, we are answering again specifically. Editor

### 海南岛面积和人口是多少？　少年儿童队队礼是举那只手？

专栏：

　　海南岛面积和人口是多少？
　　少年儿童队队礼是举那只手？
    四月二十一日本报所载“海南岛介绍”（新华社稿）及本报“庆贺登陆海南岛的胜利”社论中，海南岛面积及人口的数字不一致，许多读者来信询问这件事。这件事发生的原因，基本上是由于我们编辑工作上有缺点。社论中引用数字时，并未发现有几个不同的数字，发稿时也未与新华社稿对照。错误发现后，又因为我们找到的海南岛的面积和人口的数字有三四个说法，一时不知那个正确，所以也未能更正。近据各方材料，得知比较确实的数字如下：海南岛面积应为三万四千余平方公里，人口应为三百多万。“海南岛介绍”中所说面积五万八千余平方公里是错误的，新华社五月三日电已作更正。本报社论说面积四万余平方公里、人口二百余万，也是错误的。
    少年儿童队队礼应为举“右”手，本报有一处误为左手，这也是由于编辑工作上的疏忽。本报已于四月三十日更正。因仍有不少读者来信询及，特再答复。 编者
