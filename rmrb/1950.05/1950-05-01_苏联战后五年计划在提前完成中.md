　　The Soviet Union's Post-War Five-Year Plan is Being Completed Ahead of Schedule
    Luosuofusiji
    The Soviet people greet May Day with the joyous feeling of having fulfilled their duties and with an infinitely soaring creative labor.
    A year ago, Soviet laborers paraded on May Day, holding high banners with slogans calling for the fight for peace, for democracy, and for the early completion of the post-war Five-Year Plan. Now, a year has passed, and on this May Day of 1950, the Soviet people can proudly say that they have labored diligently for the benefit of their socialist motherland. The Soviet people are marching at the forefront of the anti-fascist democratic camp. The socialist country is overfulfilling its Five-Year Plan, thereby consolidating the cause of peace and progress throughout the world.
    In the Second World War, the Soviet Union suffered the greatest losses and bore the main burden of the war. The enemies of the socialist countries had hoped that this would exhaust the Soviet Union and cause it to regress far behind, at which point the imperialists would force the socialist countries to accept their will. But these attempts were castles in the air. The Soviet Union, "after the war, became stronger and more powerful, and more confident in its strength" (Molotov).
    While the war was still going on, the Soviet people had already begun to restore the economy in the areas they had recovered from the German invaders. When the war ended with the great victory of the Soviet armed forces, the first post-war Five-Year Plan for the restoration and development of the Soviet national economy from 1946 to 1950 was adopted in the Soviet Union, following the proposal of Stalin, the leader of all nationalities.
    This new Stalinist Five-Year Plan stipulated two main tasks. The first task was to restore the damaged areas of the country, to restore agriculture and industry to pre-war levels, and then to surpass those levels to a greater or lesser extent. The second task was to raise the living standards of all Soviet laborers by abolishing the rationing system, expanding the production of daily necessities, and successively lowering the prices of all commodities.
    If one recalls that the areas temporarily occupied and brutally destroyed by the fascist bandits produced one-third of the country's industrial products and nearly half of the country's sown area before the war, it is clear how difficult it was to solve these two major tasks.
    Four years ago, on May Day 1946, Stalin expressed his expectation that the Soviet people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, would spare no effort and labor, not only to complete but also to overfulfill the first post-war Five-Year Plan. The great Stalin was confident when he put forward this task that "a people who were able to withstand an unprecedented war in human history and emerge victorious from the war would not be intimidated by the serious post-war difficulties, but would overcome these difficulties and continue to move forward on the road to new achievements in socialist construction" (Voroshilov).
    The Soviet people responded to the call of their leader with a widespread, in-depth, and unprecedented nationwide socialist competition to strive for the early completion of the Five-Year Plan. Now, on this May Day, it is possible to make a certain summary of the heroic labor of the Soviet people in the post-war period.
    In the areas that had been occupied by the enemy, the total industrial output by the end of 1949 had already exceeded the pre-war level by 6 percent. At the same time, the yields of grains, sugar beets, sunflowers, and other crops here have also exceeded pre-war levels. And the total industrial output of the Soviet Union as a whole had reached 95 percent of the total production target for 1950 as stipulated in the Five-Year Plan by the end of 1949.
    Last year, the production of steel and rolled metal, the mining of coal and oil, and electricity production had basically reached the production levels stipulated in the 1950 plan. In the past three years, the average growth rate of Soviet industry has been 22.5 percent. This rate exceeds the rate of development of Soviet industry in any pre-war Five-Year Plan.
    In 1949, the total agricultural output also exceeded the pre-war level. The total harvest of grains, cotton, flax, sunflowers, potatoes, etc. greatly exceeded the pre-war level.
    The achievements of large-scale industry and agriculture have guaranteed a large increase in the goods needed by the people. In 1949, the production volume of various textiles, socks, boots and shoes, oils, meats, fish, sugar, soap, and other items was one and a half, two, three, or even four times greater than in 1945.
    A characteristic of the post-war period has been the very rapid expansion of the production of machinery and equipment, which has reduced manual labor. In 1949, nearly three times as many tractors were produced as in 1940, nearly twice as many automobiles, nearly two and a half times as many combine harvesters, more than four times as much metallurgical equipment, two and a half times as many electric motors, and ten times as many steam excavators.
    From this, it can be seen that the economic recovery work that the Soviet Union began after the war has been basically completed, and the socialist country has risen to a higher economic level than before the war. The Soviet Union is moving forward smoothly in all basic sectors of the national economy, fulfilling and overfulfilling the tasks of the post-war Five-Year Plan. The continuous growth of industry and agriculture guarantees a large increase in the national income of the Soviet state. This has enabled the Communist Party and the Soviet government to greatly raise the living standards of the people.
    The Soviet Union abolished the rationing system long ago and systematically lowered prices to increase the real wages of workers. For example, during the period from December 1947 to March 1950, the Soviet Union implemented three reductions in the prices of daily necessities. As a result of the price reductions, the Soviet people saved 267 billion rubles in expenses in one year. This savings was achieved because the Soviet Union maintained the current wage levels and the amounts of pensions and subsidies when it reduced prices, while the prices the state paid for agricultural products remained unchanged.
    The total national income of the Soviet Union and the individual incomes of workers, staff, and peasants had already greatly exceeded the pre-war level of 1940 last year.
    The new reduction in prices from March 1, 1950, has greatly increased the real wages of workers and staff again, and has also greatly reduced the expenses of peasants purchasing industrial products. The Soviet people are increasingly improving their well-being and are increasingly satisfying their growing cultural needs.
    From this, it can be seen that the basic tasks stipulated in the post-war Five-Year Plan are being successfully realized, and the materials cited above show that this Five-Year Plan will definitely be completed ahead of schedule!
    The free, constructive, and creative labor of workers, collective farmers, and intellectuals is the foundation for the continuous development of the socialist country and the steady growth of the material welfare of the laborers.
    The Soviet people do not work for exploiters; they work for themselves, for their society. The labor of every person in the Soviet Union is not for making capitalists rich but for expanding social wealth, which is the source of abundant and cultural life for all the people. The recognition that labor is for consolidating the socialist motherland and at the same time for improving the material welfare and cultural level of everyone is a powerful and constantly functioning driving force for the development of productivity in Soviet society.
    Socialism has mobilized the masses of the people to carry out independent creative work of historical significance, awakening their confidence in their own strength and their desire for construction. Socialism has transformed labor, which was a shame and a heavy burden under capitalism, into a noble, glorious, staunch, and heroic cause. In the Soviet Union, selfless labor is rewarded in the same way as military achievements. In the Soviet Union, the most respected people are labor heroes, that is, people who benefit and glorify the socialist motherland with their labor.
    The achievements of Soviet workers, peasants, and intellectuals in the cause of restoring and developing industry and agriculture, and in raising the living standards of laborers, once again illustrate the great strength and vitality of the Soviet system and its superiority over the capitalist system, which cannot be compared.
    The people of all countries in the world will see that the Soviet Union not only completes but also overfulfills the huge plans for economic and cultural construction. The people's democratic countries, which are marching along the socialist road and relying on the help of the Soviet Union, are also developing rapidly.
    But the capitalist world is powerless to get rid of the profound and irreconcilable contradictions that are corroding the decaying capitalist system. In capitalist countries, economic crises are growing, production is shrinking, and the ranks of the unemployed are expanding.
    The Soviet Union's industrial production level increased by 20 percent in 1949. However, the industrial production volume in the United States in October 1949 was 22 percent lower than in October 1948.
    There is no unemployment in the Soviet Union, while there are about 45 million unemployed people in capitalist countries, of which about 18 million are unemployed and semi-unemployed in the United States alone.
    In the Soviet Union, prices are constantly decreasing, the real wages of workers and staff and the incomes of peasants are constantly increasing, and the purchasing power of the ruble is constantly increasing. But in capitalist countries, prices are constantly rising, the wages of workers and staff and the incomes of peasants are constantly decreasing, inflation is constantly intensifying, and the poverty and bankruptcy of the masses are constantly increasing.
    That is the reality.
    The imperialists, led by the American fanatics who dream of dominating the world, are preparing a new world massacre in order to find a way out of a narrow dead end. But the people of all countries do not want war. The first such organized and powerful peace front in history, led by the Soviet Union, is expanding and consolidating day by day.
    The Soviet people believe in their own strength. They work with great joy because they know that every victory they achieve on the economic construction and cultural construction fronts is a step towards communism. They are proud of their most beautiful motherland because it occupies the leading position of all progressive mankind and points out a correct path towards freedom and happiness for all oppressed nations.

　　苏联战后五年计划在提前完成中
    罗索夫斯基
    苏联人民怀着已经完成职责的愉快的心情并以无限高涨的创造性的劳动来迎接五一劳动节。
    在一年以前，苏联的劳动者在五一节游行行列上曾经高举起写着为争取和平、争取民主及为提早完成战后五年计划而斗争的口号的旗帜。现在过了一年，是在一九五○年五一节这一天，苏联人民可以自豪地说，他们曾经光荣地为社会主义祖国的利益而勤劳工作过了。苏联人民正在反法西斯的民主阵营前卫中迈进着。社会主义国家在超额完成着自己的五年计划，以此巩固全世界的和平与进步的事业。
    在第二次世界大战中，苏联遭受了最大的损失，担负了战争的主要重荷。社会主义国家的敌人曾希望这将使苏联精疲力竭并使他倒退得很远的，而那时帝国主义者就将迫使社会主义国家接受他们的意志。但这些企图乃是空中楼阁。苏联在“战争结束后，更加强大而有力，更加相信自己的力量了”（莫洛托夫语）。
    当战争还在进行的时候，苏联人民就已开始恢复自己从德寇手中收复的地区内的经济。当战争以苏联武装力量的巨大胜利而结束之后，在苏联，就遵照各族人民的领袖斯大林的提议，通过了一九四六年到五○年恢复和发展苏联国民经济的第一个战后五年计划。
    这一个新的斯大林五年计划，规定了两个主要任务。第一个任务，是恢复国内遭受损害的地区，恢复农业和工业的战前水平，然后再或多或少地超过这个水平。第二个任务，是以取消配给制度、扩大日用品的生产及接连降低所有商品的价格的方法，来提高苏联全国劳动者的生活水平。
    如果回想一下，那些被法西斯强盗暂时占领并遭受蛮横破坏的地区内，在战前曾出产工业品占全国三分之一，这一地区播种面积几乎占全国播种面积的一半的这种情形，那就很显然地可以看出解决这两大任务是有多么大的困难。
    四年以前，一九四六年五一节，斯大林曾经表示期望苏联人民在共产党领导之下毫不顾惜一切力量和劳动，不仅完成、而且超额完成战后第一个五年计划。伟大的斯大林在提出这一任务时曾经确信，“这样的人民，即能够经得住人类史上空前未有的战争而且从战争中成为胜利者的人民，决不会在严重的战后困难面前表示畏惧，而是克服这些困难，在争取社会主义建设新成就的道路上继续向前迈进”（伏罗希洛夫）。
    苏联人民以广泛深入规模空前的争取提早完成五年计划的全民的社会主义竞赛，来回答自己领袖的号召。现在，在五一节这天，可以把苏联人民在战后时期的英勇劳动作出一定的总结。
    在遭受过敌寇占领的地区内，工业方面的总产量，在一九四九年底就已经超过了战前水平百分之六。同时这里的谷物、糖萝卜、向日葵及其他农作物，也都超过了战前的水平。而苏联全国工业的总产量，在一九四九年底就已达到五年计划所规定的一九五○年生产总额的百分之九十五。
    去年钢、辗金属的生产，煤与石油的采掘，以及电力生产等方面，基本上都已达到一九五○年计划所规定的生产水平。在最近三年来，苏维埃工业增长的平均速度为百分之二十二·五。这种速度，超过了苏联工业在战前任何一个五年计划中的发展速度。
    在一九四九年，农业方面的总产量也已超过了战前水平。谷物、棉花、亚麻、向日葵、马铃薯等的总收获量，都大大地超过了战前水平。
    大工业和农业的成就，保证了人民所需商品的大量增长。在一九四九年生产的各种织物、袜子、靴鞋、油脂、肉类、鱼类、糖、肥皂及他种物品的生产量比较一九四五年多至一倍半、两倍、三倍、四倍以上不等。
    战后期间的特征，是非常迅速地扩增了机械和装备的出产，减轻了人力的劳动。在一九四九年所生产的拖拉机较比一九四○年几达三倍，汽车——几达两倍，康拜因机——几达两倍半，冶金的装备——四倍以上，电动机——达两倍半，蒸气掘凿机——达十倍。
    由此可见，苏联在战后所开始的经济恢复工作基本上已经完成，而社会主义国家已上升到比战前更高的经济水平。苏联在国民经济一切基本部门内，都在顺利地向前迈进，完成着、超额完成着战后五年计划的任务。工业和农业的不断增长，保证了苏维埃国家国民收入的大量增加。这就使得共产党和苏联政府大大地提高了人民的生活水平。
    苏联早就取消了配给制，并有计划地降低了物价，以提高劳动者的实际工资。例如从一九四七年十二月至一九五○年三月这一期间内，苏联曾经实施了三次日用品价格的减低。由于减低价格的结果，苏联人民在一年间所节省的用费达二千六百七十亿卢布。这种节省之所以能够达到，是因为苏联国内减低物价时仍保持着现行的工资水平和抚恤金及津贴费数额，而国家购买农产品的价格也仍然不变。
    苏联总的国民收入与工人、职员和农民的个别收入，还在去年就都已大大超过了战前一九四○年的水平。
    从一九五○年三月一日起物价的新降低，使工人职员的实际工资再度大为提高，也使农民购买工业品的支出再度大为减低。苏联人民日益提高着自己的福利，日益圆满地满足着自己不断增长的文化需求。
    由此可见，战后五年计划所规定的各项基本任务，是在顺利地实现着，而上面所引证的材料，则表明这次五年计划定将提早完成！
    工人、集体农民及知识分子们的自由的、建设性的、创造性的劳动，乃是社会主义国家不断发展和劳动者物质福利稳步增长的基础。
    苏联人民不是为剥削者工作，他们是为自己，为自己的社会而工作。苏联每一个人的劳动，不是为使资本家发财致富，而是为要扩增社会财富，这财富是全体人民丰裕的和文化生活的泉源。劳动是为巩固社会主义祖国而同时又是提高每一个人的物质福利和文化水平的这一认识，乃是苏维埃社会生产力发展的强大的并经常起着作用的动力。
    社会主义已发动了人民群众进行有历史意义的独立的创造工作，唤醒了他们对自身力量的信心及对建设的热望。社会主义把在资本主义下是耻辱和沉重负担的劳动变成了崇高、光荣、刚毅和英勇的事业。在苏联，对于忘我劳动是像对于战功一样来褒奖的。在苏联，最受尊敬的人们就是劳动英雄，即是以自己的劳动来替社会主义祖国造福和增光的人们。
    苏联工人、农民及知识分子，在恢复和发展工业和农业的事业中、以及在提高劳动者生活水平中所达到的成绩，又一次地阐明苏维埃制度的伟大力量和生气蓬勃，它那远非资本主义制度所可比拟的优越性。
    全世界各国人民都会看到，苏联不仅完成，而且还超额完成经济和文化建设的庞大计划。沿着社会主义道路迈进并依靠着苏联帮助的各人民民主国家，也同样地是在迅速地发展着。
    但是资本主义世界却无力摆脱那些腐蚀着腐朽透顶的资本主义体系的、极深刻而不可调和的矛盾。在资本主义各国内，经济危机正在增长，生产正在缩减，失业者的队伍正在扩大。
    苏联的工业品生产水平，在一九四九年间提高了百分之二十。但是，美国在一九四九年十月间的工业生产量，却比一九四八年十月间降低了百分之二十二。
    在苏联没有失业的现象，而在资本主义各国的失业者则共约四千五百万人，其中美国一国的失业者和半失业者即约计一千八百万人。
    在苏联国内，物价不断地减低、工人职员的实际工资和农民的收入不断地增长，卢布的购买力不断地提高。而在资本主义各国内，则是物价的不断上涨、工人职员工资和农民收入的不断减低、通货膨胀现象的不断加剧、以及群众的贫困和破产现象的不断增长。
    事实就是这样。
    以妄想统治世界的美国狂妄分子为首的各帝国主义者，为了从狭窄的死巷里摸索出路，正在准备着新的世界性的大屠杀。但一切国家的人民都不愿意战争。以苏联为首的、在历史上第一次这样有组织的强大的和平阵线，正在逐日扩大和逐日巩固着。
    苏联人民相信自己的力量。他们以极愉快的心情工作着，因为他们知道，他们在经济建设和文化建设战线上的每一个胜利，就是走向共产主义的一步。他们为自己最美好的祖国而自傲，因为它居于一切进步人类的领导地位，并为所有被压迫民族指出一条走向自由与幸福的正确道路。
