I Firmly Support the Soviet Union's Policy of Peace

A Letter to Pravda from Lagorish, Former Assistant Editor of "British Commonwealth" Magazine at the British Embassy in the Soviet Union

To the Editor:

Not long ago, I read a book entitled "A Military Attaché in Moscow." This book was published in England and written by General Hilton. In 1947, he gained a very bad reputation in your country because of his failed espionage conspiracy near Moscow. This general seems to have written such a book full of lies and slanders about the Soviet Union out of anger at the failure of his foolish activities.

From this book, it is clear why the general told such blatant lies about the Soviet people: he wanted to put the blame for provoking a new war on the Soviet Union.

Reading Hilton's book, the instigation and obvious contradictions are astonishing. Any honest person, even if he has only lived in the Soviet Union for a few weeks, would say that there is not a sincere word in this book. Of course, the matter is not limited to Hilton. According to Britain's laws on national secrets, his book could not be published without the permission and sponsorship of the British government.

Where did General Hilton collect these foul things?

Did he hide in the gutters near Soviet factories? No. He found these filth in the Russian Secretariat of the British Embassy in Moscow.

Although this general pretends to be an "ordinary soldier," he named himself "A Military Attaché in Moscow." In fact, he is a loyal servant of the Anglo-American warmongers and militarists who are trying to arouse hatred of the Soviet Union among our people.

Thousands of our compatriots have understood this deception and are determined to strive for peace and friendship with the Soviet Union. However, there are still many ordinary men and women in Britain who are constantly instilled with such ideas that they are hesitant to choose between war and friendship with the Soviet Union. There are many kind people who think they can take an impartial neutral stance. However, if these people do not come to the peace camp, they will inevitably fall into the hands of the capitalists and militarists who are preparing for a new war.

I worked in the British Embassy in Moscow. I have seen enough of the tricks of these veterans, who are manufacturing slanders and deceptions just like Hilton. With their help, our government is trying and hoping to arouse hatred of the Soviet Union among the British people in order to plunge our generation into a new world war.

I am willing to use everything I have seen and heard to help my compatriots understand where the truth lies and where the lies and deceptions are. I want to help them not to be blind tools in the hands of unscrupulous politicians.

Until recently, I was a Conservative. During the four years of the war, I served in the British Royal Air Force. After the war, I returned to Cambridge University to study Russian history and literature at the Slavic Studies Department.

It should be pointed out that the Russian history and literature courses I studied there only went up to the nineteenth century. Regarding modern Russian life, I could only see it from certain unreliable sources, like the books I mentioned earlier, which presented a distorted picture of Russian life.

Of course, I could not know the actual situation of Soviet life at that time.

In 1948, I was proposed to work as an assistant editor of the "British Commonwealth" magazine at the British Embassy in Moscow by Professor Siel, who was the leader of the Slavic Studies Department at Cambridge University. I accepted this position.

I still remember the conversation I had with Ms. Siel when I left England. She was concerned about my political views, whether I supported the Conservative Party or the Labour Party. She said, "This is undoubtedly the same. However, I hope you are not a Communist." I replied that I was not.

"Then you have a bright future ahead of you," Ms. Siel added.

I asked her if I could get to know the Russian people in Moscow. She raised her hands in fear and said, "Don't be so naive, my dear Lagorish. In that place, you won't even know a single Russian citizen."

As soon as I arrived in Moscow, I was immediately surrounded by the atmosphere of lies and rumors about Soviet Russia that enveloped the embassy. This atmosphere was deliberately fabricated day by day in the embassy, and I am personally convinced of this.

I had planned to get to know Russian life. I thought I had to cross the "Iron Curtain," as the Foreign Office had warned me before I left. But when I understood the situation in Moscow, I immediately realized that they were deliberately scaring me. If there really is an "Iron Curtain," then it is only in the British Embassy on Sofiyskaya Embankment. The purpose of this "Iron Curtain" is to spread slander and lies about the Soviet Union and prevent every new arrival from knowing the reality of Russian life.

The senior officials in the embassy were afraid, even afraid that their own staff would understand that they were being deceived when they came into contact with Soviet reality.

I saw Moscow with my own eyes. Because I understood Russian, I was able to understand how the Soviet people lived. What was presented to me was a completely different life, a different kind of people.

The Soviet people I met impressed me deeply with their love for new things, their optimism, and their confidence in the future. I am convinced that the Soviet people truly believe in and strive for peace.

Living facts shattered the coat of my own prejudice. I could not help but consider what was happening around me.

All of this completely contradicted what other people in the embassy told me. Such as First Secretary Yore, Embassy Press Attaché Dobbs, and assistant editor of "British Commonwealth" magazine, Briel, etc.

These so-called "Russian experts," these "gentlemen," are making their way to promotion by creating false "Moscow news." It seems that whoever shows enthusiasm in the necessary aspect—that is, in finding, or more precisely, in fabricating "facts" to slander the Soviet way of life—can embark on the "path to promotion" or be rewarded.

In order to strengthen anti-Soviet "spiritual education," there are special lectures in the embassy on distorting Soviet policies.

As a reasonably educated Englishman, I can understand the basic concept of integrity. The hypocrisy of these diplomats angered me.

I needed to choose: to have a successful career as a slanderer or to join the struggle against the policy of war. I chose the policy of peace.

At a routine lecture, First Secretary Yore of the embassy spoke about Soviet foreign policy. I openly opposed his view that Russia was using communism as a tool for military aggression in Europe. They did not allow me to object, as Dobbs told me, I could not be allowed to have views that contradicted "the policy implemented by the embassy."

It is not allowed to lift the edge of the "Iron Curtain" hanging in the British Embassy.

The next day, Ambassador Sir David Kelly called me in and suggested that I leave Moscow immediately or change my attitude.

At the same time, at the end of the conversation, the ambassador told me in a meaningful and kind manner: "I can say that our attitude towards you cannot be compared with the attitude of the Americans towards you—if you were working for the Americans."

I submitted my resignation and left the embassy.

If I had been willing to use my knowledge of Russian to do anti-Soviet work, then I could have stayed in the embassy. However, it is not appropriate for British diplomacy to have someone in the embassy who dares to face the truth.

I am convinced that the Soviet Union is a force for peace in the world, and at the same time, I am convinced that this fact is being distorted and concealed by those who seem to guarantee friendship and peace with the Soviet Union.

In fact, their activities are not defending peace, but serving the interests of warmongers.

The foreign policy of Attlee-Bevin, as determined by the Atlantic Pact, is no different from the policy of Churchill and his followers, who sold out our country to American imperialism.

Every honest Briton who loves his country, loves his people, and believes in the future should choose the only correct path—the path to peace.

My generation and I will not go to war to increase the income of Wall Street and the City of London.

I believe that peace can be guaranteed in this way.

I am preparing to return to England to participate in this struggle for peace and friendship with the Soviet Union, no matter how difficult this struggle may be.

I would be very grateful if you could publish this letter in your newspaper.

Faithfully yours, Dagolish (Translated by Jun Qiang from the March 9th Pravda)

### 我坚决拥护苏联和平政策　英驻苏大使馆前《不列颠联邦》杂志助编拉哥里什给真理报的一封信

专栏：

　　我坚决拥护苏联和平政策
　　英驻苏大使馆前《不列颠联邦》杂志助编拉哥里什给真理报的一封信编辑先生：
    不久以前我读过一本书，题名为《一个军事武官在莫斯科》。该书是在英国出版的，作者是西尔顿将军。他曾于一九四七年因为在莫斯科附近的间谍阴谋失败，而在贵国得到了极坏的名声。这位将军似乎是因为他那愚妄的活动没有成功，因而恼羞成怒写了这样一本书，书中充满着关于苏联的谎言与诽谤。
    从这本书中可以清楚地看出这位将军为什么对于苏维埃人民说了这样的漫天大谎：他想把挑动新战争的过错放在苏联身上。
    读了西尔顿这本书，其中的挑拨和显著的矛盾是惊人的。任何一个正直的人，即使他只在苏联住过几个星期也好，他会说这本书中没有一句真诚的话。当然，事情并不仅限于西尔顿。依据英国的有关国家秘密的法令，他的书如果得不到英国政府的允许和赞助是不能出版的。
    西尔顿将军在那里收集了这些秽泥呢？
    是不是他曾藏在苏维埃工厂附近的水沟中吗？不是的。这些秽物，是他在英国驻莫斯科大使馆的俄国秘书处中找到的。
    虽然这位将军装模作样地自称是一个“普通的书士兵”，但他却给自己的命名为“一个军事武官在莫斯科”。事实上，他正是那些企图唤起我国人民对苏联仇恨的英美战争贩子及军国主义者的忠实奴仆。
    我国数以千计的同胞们，已经明白了这种欺骗，而坚决地争取与苏联的和平及友好。但是，在英国还有许多普通的男女——他们经常地被灌输这类思想，以至他们在选择与苏联战争还是友好时，彷徨不定。有许多善良的人，他们想可以采取不偏不倚的中立态度。但是，这些人如果不到和平阵营中来时，则不由地会落到那些准备新战争的资本家与军国主义者的手掌中去。
    我在莫斯科英国大使馆中工作。我已看够了这些老手们的花样，他们正和西尔顿一样制造着诽谤与欺骗。我国政府借他们之助，企图并希望着在英国人民之间唤起对苏联的仇恨情绪，以便使我们这一代人投入新的世界战争。
    我愿意以我所看到所听到的一切，帮助我的同胞们了解，那里是真理，那里是谎言欺骗。我愿帮助他们不要做无耻的政客掌中的盲目工具。
    一直到最近，我都是一个保守党员。战争的四年期间我曾在英国皇家空军服务。战后我回到剑桥大学在斯拉夫语学院学习俄国历史与文学。
    应该指出，我在那里所学的俄国历史与文学的课程，都只到十九世纪为止，关于现代俄国的生活，却只能从某些不可靠的来源才能看到，像我刚才说过的，这些书以歪曲的形态表现出俄国的生活。
    当然，我那时也不能知道苏联生活的实际情形。
    一九四八年，由教授西尔女士的介绍——她是剑桥大学斯拉夫语学院的领导人——，提议让我到莫斯科英国驻苏大使馆做《不列颠联邦》杂志的助编。我接受了这个职位。
    现在我还记得离开英国时与西尔女士的谈话。她关心我的政治观点，即我究竟是拥护保守党的呢还是拥护工党。她说：“这，无疑的，是一样。不过，我希望你不是一个共产党员。”我回答说，不是。
    “那么，你前面就有着光辉的官途。”西尔女士附加说。
    我问她我在莫斯科能否认识俄国的人民，她恐惧地扬起两手说：“不要那样天真吧，我亲爱的拉哥里什。在那个地方，你甚至连一个俄国公民也不会认识的。”
    一到莫斯科，我立即处在笼罩着大使馆的关于苏维埃俄国的谎话与流言的气氛中。这种空气是大使馆中故意地逐日捏造的，我以个人的经验确信这件事。
    我曾打算认识俄国的生活。我想这样我必需穿过“铁幕”，如我临行时外交部所警告过我的一样。但当我一认识了莫斯科的情势时，我立即明白他们是在故意吓我。如果真正存在着什么“铁幕”的话，那么它只是在索菲河岸大街的不列颠大使馆中。这“铁幕”的目的即是传布关于对苏联的诽谤与谎言，并使每个新到达的人不能知道俄国生活的实况。
    大使馆中的高级官员们害怕，甚至怕他们自己的职员们触到了苏维埃的现实时，会明白是受到了欺骗。
    我亲眼看到了莫斯科。由于我懂得俄文，我有可能了解苏维埃人是怎样地生活着。我面前呈现出来的完全是另外一种生活，另外的一种人们。
    我所遇到的苏联人们，以他们对新鲜事物的爱，以他们的乐观及对未来的信心给了我很深的印象。我确信苏维埃人民是真正相信和平并争取和平的。
    活生生的事实，粉碎了我自己偏见的外衣。我不能不考虑我周围所发生的事情。
    这一切完全与大使馆中其他人员告诉我的话相矛盾。如一等秘书约尔，大使馆新闻随员多布士及《不列颠联邦》杂志的助编布里来尔等所告诉我的那些。
    这些所谓“俄国通”们，这些“绅士们”，是靠制造虚妄的“莫斯科消息”而给自己做升官之路。似乎是，谁如果在必需的那方面表示热心——即是说在寻找，或更确切地说在捏造“事实”来诬蔑苏维埃的生活方式，那么他就可以走上“升官之路”或受到褒奖。
    为了加强反苏维埃的“精神教育”起见，在大使馆中有专门关于歪曲苏联政策各种讲演。
    做为一个受过相当教育的英国人，是可以理解关于正直这一基本概念的。这些外交家们的伪善使我愤慨。
    我需要选择：作为诽谤者角色而官运亨通或者参加反对战争政策的斗争。我选择了和平政策。
    在一次例行的讲演会上，大使馆一等秘书约尔讲苏联外交政策。我公开地反对了他关于俄国在欧洲利用共产主义做为军事侵略工具的意见。他们不允许我反对，像多布士告诉我的，不能允许我有与“大使馆实行的政策”相矛盾的见解。
    挑起挂在英国大使馆中的“铁幕”的边缘，是不被允许的。
    第二天，大使大卫凯莱爵士把我叫去，提议让我立即离开莫斯科或改变自己的态度。
    同时，在谈话结束时，大使意味深长地亲切的样子告诉我：“我可以说，我们对您的态度，是不能与美国人对您的态度相比的——假使您是在美国人那里做事的话。”
    我交了辞呈，离开了大使馆。
    假使我要愿意把自己的俄文知识用来做反苏工作，那么我可以留在大使馆。但是，在大使馆中有一个敢于正视真理的人，对于不列颠的外交却是不合适的。
    我确信苏联是全世界拥护和平的力量，同时我确信这件事正是被那些似乎是保证与苏联的友好与和平的人们所歪曲掩盖起来的。
    事实上，他们的活动不是在保卫和平，而是为战争贩子的利益服务。
    大西洋公约所确定的艾德礼——贝文的外交政策，和出卖我国给美帝国主义者的邱吉尔及其徒党的政策，是没有区别的。
    每一个爱国家爱人民并相信未来的正直的英国人，都应该选择唯一正确的道路——争取和平的道路。
    我和我们这一代的人们，不为华尔街及伦敦城区增加收入而战争。
    我相信，这样和平是可以保证的。
    我预备回到英国参加这一争取与苏联和平及友好的斗争，不论这斗争将如何艰苦。
    如果您把我这封信公布在您们的报纸上，我将异常感谢。
    忠实于您的达哥里什（君强译自三月九日真理报）
