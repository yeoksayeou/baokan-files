Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 28th (TASS dispatch): The French authorities are currently conducting trials against peace advocates who were arrested for participating in the peace struggle. This act of persecution has ignited strong protests from people everywhere.

　　In Tulle, in the French province of Corrèze, six arrested participants in the peace movement have been sentenced to imprisonment ranging from one to six months, and one month and two weeks of suspended sentences respectively. A wave of protests against the trial of peace advocates has swept through the Corrèze province. Thousands of working people went to Tulle to protest the persecution of patriots.

　　In Lyon, when the secretary of the local union of chemical industry workers was on trial, the working people held a mass demonstration outside the court, forcing the court to postpone the verdict for a week.

　　In Paris, the youth magazine "Avant-Garde" was also on trial for publishing articles stating that the French people would never fight against the Soviet Union. During the court proceedings, the former editor of the magazine and member of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party, Michaud, pointed out that the statement issued by the French Communist Party, "The French people will not fight against the Soviet Union," has been warmly embraced by millions of French people. The statement published by "Avant-Garde" is entirely in accordance with the interests of France and conducive to the cause of peace. Michaud rebuked the French authorities for condoning the criminal war-mongering propaganda. It is this propaganda that should be prohibited.

　　Regarding the French government's persecution of Mrs. Gordon for her active participation in the defense of peace, the French Women's Union issued a statement expressing strong protest and calling on French men and women to demand an immediate halt to the legal action against Mrs. Gordon through various means.

　　法政府迫害和平拥护者激起各地人民愤怒抗议
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社巴黎二十八日讯：法国各地当局正对因参加和平斗争而被捕的和平拥护者进行审讯，这一迫害行动已激起各地人民的强烈抗议。
    在法国高莱兹省的都勒市，六名被捕的和平运动参加者已被分别判处一至六个月监禁，和一个月及两星期的缓刑。抗议审判和平拥护者的浪潮席卷高莱兹省。数千劳动人民到都勒市去提出对迫害爱国人士的抗议。
    在里昂，当化学工业工人地方工会组织的书记受审时，劳动人民在法庭外面举行了群众示威，法院被迫延期宣判一星期。
    在巴黎，青年刊物前卫报曾刊载法国人民决不与苏联作战的文章，因而也受到审讯。该报前任编辑、法共政治局委员米肖在法庭中指出：法共所发出的“法国人民决不对苏联作战”的声明，已受到数百万法国人民的热烈拥护。前卫报所发表的声明，完全符合法国的利益，并有利于和平的事业。米肖斥责法国当局纵容着罪恶的贩卖战争的宣传。这种宣传才是应该禁止的。
    关于戈登夫人因积极参与保卫和平工作而遭受法国政府迫害一事，法兰西妇女联盟发表声明，表示强烈抗议，并号召法国男女通过各种方式，要求立即停止对戈登夫人的法律行动。
