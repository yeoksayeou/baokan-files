[News from the Beijing Municipal News Office] Recently, various tax bureaus in Beijing are holding conferences for industrial and commercial businesses, commending model taxpayers who emerged during the collection of the second half of 1949 industrial and commercial tax. Adhering to the principle of considering the operations of industrial and commercial businesses, they are handling outstanding tax payments sequentially based on specific circumstances.

The Beijing Industrial and Commercial Tax for the second half of 1949 was levied under conditions of sluggish market sales and temporary difficulties faced by private industrial and commercial businesses. During the legal payment period from April 1st to the end of April, most industrial and commercial businesses did their best to pay their taxes, and many model households emerged who took the lead in paying. However, a small number of industrial and commercial households either faced unfair assessments, suffered business losses, or had temporary difficulties with capital turnover, and were unable to pay taxes on time. In order to address the temporary difficulties of some industrial and commercial businesses and to conclude the collection of this industrial and commercial tax as soon as possible, the Beijing Tax Bureau, after requesting instructions from higher authorities, previously notified each tax bureau to periodically convene industrial and commercial household conferences to commend model taxpayers. Apart from legally dealing with individual tax payers who had the ability to pay but intentionally delayed payment, those industrial and commercial households with genuine difficulties should be given consideration as soon as possible, based on their actual ability to pay, through deferrals, reductions, or exemptions. This work of clearing up outstanding accounts is relatively arduous. On the one hand, the actual difficulties of each tax payer must be taken into account; on the other hand, fairness and reasonableness must be ensured, so that individual tax payers who have the ability to pay but deliberately do not pay tax do not take advantage, and that those who pay tax early do not feel disadvantaged. In this situation, over the past half-month, cadres from each tax bureau have generally conducted repeated discussions with each tax payer in arrears with caution, further understanding the actual business and burden situation of each household, and making separate handling opinions on a household-by-household basis, and reporting them to the Municipal Tax Bureau for approval before implementation. As of now, among the city's 2,936 industrial and commercial tax payers in arrears, except for the handling opinions of over two hundred households that have not been finalized, the preliminary handling opinions for the other households have been reviewed and approved by the Municipal Tax Bureau. Among them, 1,281 households were granted deferrals due to temporary capital turnover difficulties; 957 households were granted reductions because the assessments were unfair or the business losses were too heavy, resulting in an excessive burden; 317 households were granted exemptions because they genuinely had no ability to pay. In addition, there are also dozens of tax payers in arrears who are prepared to be transferred to the court for handling.

　　各税务分局表扬纳税模范
    分别具体情况陆续处理滞纳问题
    【京市新闻处讯】京市各税务分局近日正分别召开工商业户大会，表扬在征收一九四九年下半年工商业税中涌现的纳税模范者，并根据照顾工商业者经营的原则，分别具体情况，陆续处理至今尚未缴清税款的滞纳户。
    京市一九四九年下半年工商业税是在市场商品滞销，私营工商业面临暂时困难的情况下开征的，在四月一日到四月底法定缴款期限的一个月中，一般工商业者都尽力缴了税款，并且涌现了不少带头缴款的模范户，但也有一小部工商户，或因评议不公，或因营业亏累，或因资金一时周转困难，未能如期缴税。京市税务局为照顾部分工商业者的暂时困难，并早日结束此次工商业税的征收工作，经请示上级后，前曾通知各税务分局，除定期召开工商业户大会，表扬纳税模范，并对个别有负担能力而故意拖延不缴税款的依法处理外，对于目前确有困难的工商业户，应尽速按其实际负担能力，分别予以缓期、减征、免征的照顾。这一清理滞纳户的工作是比较艰巨的，一方面，必须照顾各滞纳户的实际困难，另一方面，也必须切实做到公平合理，不使个别有负担能力故意不缴税的滞纳户钻了空子，使早纳税款的反而感到吃亏。在此情况下，半月来，各税务分局的干部一般都慎重地与各滞纳户作了反复的商谈，进一步了解各户实际营业与负担情况，一家家分别作出处理意见，报请市税务局批准后执行。截至现在止，全市二千九百三十六户工商业税滞纳户，除有二百余户的处理意见尚未作最后决定外，其他各户的处理初步意见都已经市税务局审查同意，其中，因一时资金周转困难，予以缓期者计一千二百八十一户；因评议不公或营业亏累而致负担太重，予以减征者计九百五十七户；确已无负担能力予以免征者计三百十七户。此外，准备移送法院处理的滞纳户也有数十户。
