Qinhuangdao Kailuan Weighing Station
Reading Group Report on Reading Newspaper Experience
Dear Editors,

    Today we are communicating with you for the first time, and we have the following opinions:

    (1) After reading Comrade Liu Shaoqi's speech at the cadre meeting celebrating "May Day" Labor Day, we have a clearer understanding that the Central People's Government led by Chairman Mao is a government that truly serves the people. From Comrade Shaoqi's speech, we see that the communists have a thorough understanding of the actual situation of the people's motherland; only in this way can they produce "methods that address reality, overcome difficulties, and achieve results," and determine various correct policies. The reason they can do this is because the communists serve the people and stand among the people, not above them.

    (2) Comrade Dong Biwu's report, "The Relief and Welfare Undertakings of New China," is of great significance because in this report, based on facts, it points out that the reason the Chinese people have suffered disasters is due to the "grants" of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries. It exposes the recent "disaster relief" trick of American imperialism, which is attempting to undermine the people's China in various ways while wearing a "humanitarian" cloak. At the same time, we are deeply moved by the words "the relief and welfare undertakings of the people must rely on the people themselves to be resolved." In addition to donating one day's wages to relieve unemployed workers in Shanghai in response to the call of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, we have also decided to continue to save and donate to disaster relief based on our individual living situations.

    (3) From Comrade Teng Daiyuan's report, "Eradicating Bureaucratic Work Style in the Railway System," a public servant of the people has vividly appeared. In this report, he sincerely conducted self-criticism. Every word of his report touched our hearts. He pointed out the shortcomings that the railway sector could have avoided but did not avoid since liberation, and at the same time, he pointed out how to correct these shortcomings in the future. These shortcomings not only exist in the railway system, but may also exist in other departments. Therefore, the methods for correcting shortcomings put forward by Comrade Daiyuan are not only applicable to the railway system, but also to other departments. We believe that this report should not only be discussed and studied in detail by cadres and employees in the railway system, but also deserves the attention and study of cadres and employees in other departments.

    (4) Your newspaper moved "People's Garden" to the fourth page and summarized all advertisements to the sixth page. This not only increased readers' attention to "People's Garden," but also provided convenience for those who want to see advertisements. We are very satisfied. Publishing the "Summary" in the corner of the masthead provides great help to readers, especially busy readers. From the "Summary," readers can distinguish the nature of the news稿s as major or minor, as well as the page position of each 稿, and allocate their reading time without waste. However, we hope that your newspaper will maintain or further improve the conciseness and organization of the "Summary" text.

    Sincerely,
                  Qinhuangdao Kailuan Weighing Station Reading Group May 7

### 秦皇岛开滦磅房　读报组报告读报心得

专栏：读报组反映

　　秦皇岛开滦磅房
　　读报组报告读报心得亲爱的编辑同志：
    今天我们和你们作首次的通信，我们有如下的意见：
    （１）我们读过了刘少奇同志在庆祝“五一”劳动节干部大会上的讲话，更清楚的认识到毛主席所领导的中央人民政府，是真正为人民服务的政府。从少奇同志的讲话里，我们见到共产党人对人民祖国的实际情况了如指掌；惟其能如此，才可能产生“针对现实，克服困难，收得效果”的办法，决定各种正确的方针。而其所以能如此者，则是因为共产党人是为人民服务，是站在人民中间，而不是站在人民头上。
    （２）董必武同志所作《新中国的救济福利事业》的报告，是富有重要意义的，因为在这个报告里，根据事实，指出中国人民所以遭受灾害的原因，是由于美帝国主义与国民党反动派的“恩赐”。它揭穿了最近美帝国主义的所谓“救灾”把戏，是披着“人道”的外衣，企图从各方面来破坏人民的中国。同时我们深为“人民大众的救济福利事业，必须依靠人民自己，才能得到解决”的话所感动。我们除已捐献一日工资救济上海失业工人，以响应总工会的号召外，还决定根据个人的生活情况，继续节约，捐献救灾。
    （３）从滕代远同志《铲除铁路系统中官僚主义作风》的报告里，活现出一个人民勤务员应有的姿态。他在这篇报告里，恳切地展开了自我批评。他报告的每一句话，都说到我们的心眼里了。他指出了解放以来，铁路方面可以避免而没有避免的缺点，同时他又指出了今后如何改正这些缺点的方法。而这些缺点不仅铁路系统中有，其他部门也可能有。因此代远同志提出的改正缺点的方法，不仅铁路系统中适用，其他部门也适用。我们认为这篇报告，不仅铁路系统中的干部职工们要详细讨论，深入学习，就是其他部门的干部职工们，也同样有重视与学习的必要。
    （４）贵报把《人民园地》挪到第四版，把所有的广告归纳到第六版。这不但增加了读者对《人民园地》的重视，也给要看广告者以方便。我们很满意。在报头一角刊载《提要》，这给读者，尤其是工作繁忙的读者以很大帮助。读者们从《提要》里，可以分别出新闻稿的性质的主要或次要，以及各稿的版位，而不浪费地来分配自己的读报时间。不过我们希望贵报要保持或再进一步的做到《提要》文字的简明与条理化。
      此致敬礼
                  秦皇岛开滦磅房读报小组  五月七日
