　　Public Factories in Xin Hailian City
　　Improve Safety and Health Equipment
    [Our Newspaper, Xin Hailian City News] Since inspecting safety and health equipment on March 30th, public factories in Xin Hailian City have actively improved safety and health work based on their specific circumstances and by incorporating workers' opinions, prioritizing tasks according to their importance and urgency. The Longdong Match Factory, to prevent fires, has built two new rooms to store nitrate and phosphorus separately. Warning signs have been erected in fire-prohibited areas. Fire extinguishers, fire-extinguishing bombs, canvas buckets, and other fire-fighting equipment have been purchased. A factory protection central team has been established, with rescue and security groups under it, to promote factory protection work among all workers. In terms of welfare and hygiene, windows have been added to the dipping head area, greatly reducing the suffocating effect of phosphorus gas. Workers who originally sat on the damp ground while arranging matches now have a short stool each. A total of twenty spittoons have been added to the various workshops. A workers' dining hall has also been established. The phenomenon of continuous overtime has also been corrected. Other factories, such as the Power Plant, Huaxing Iron Factory, and Haizhou Flour Mill, have also made improvements in safety equipment and cleanliness. The Power Plant's coal crane has been replaced with a crane to prevent danger. Guardrails have been installed around the distribution panel for isolation. The Iron Factory's electric roller is equipped with a box cover to reduce danger. The electric saw is equipped with a safety cover to eliminate dust and prevent respiratory problems. The Flour Mill has established inspection and handover systems to prevent accidents.
