　　"Red Flags Sweep the West Wind" is an extremely valuable revolutionary historical record film. From its content, it starts from Yan'an (northern Shaanxi), goes through the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan, the four-year People's Liberation War, until the great victory of the whole country. Before this stage of revolutionary history, during the ten years of civil war and the 25,000-mile Long March, due to the limitations of material conditions at the time, it was impossible to make film documentaries. In terms of film, this is an irreparable defect. As for the stage of the national victory, we already have sufficient conditions to shoot movies, and many great historical scenes have been widely staged among the broad masses, and will continue to be filmed in the future, so that the great victory of the Chinese people can be truly displayed in front of the Chinese and the people of the world. Therefore, only this revolutionary stage starting from Yan'an (northern Shaanxi) has "Red Flags Sweep the West Wind" preserving a part of the historical truth for us in terms of film.

　　"On the peak of Mount Liupan, red flags are waving in the west wind; today we hold the long rope in our hands, when will we bind the gray dragon?" Today, as we recite the poems of Comrade Mao Zedong and face the lens of the majestic Mount Liupan on the screen, our emotions are completely dissolved in the entire solemn history. As we watch the People's Liberation Army marching across Mount Liupan towards the northwest frontier in the situation of national victory, we seem to also see the snow-capped mountains and the grasslands... And in Yan'an (northern Shaanxi), many scenes that we ourselves had personally experienced miraculously appear before our eyes.

　　Scene after scene of the film appears before our eyes: the historical lens unfolds from the foot of the Pagoda Hill in Yan'an, a place once cherished by thousands of revolutionary youths. On the barren mountaintops, those grasses, those small trees, those soils that our bare feet once trampled on... It reminds us of those difficult years. Going up the mountain in the morning with a steamed bun to reclaim the land, and coming back in the evening to eat wild vegetables picked by female comrades. However, the difficulties did not diminish our will in the slightest. That was in 1943, under the call of Chairman Mao, we launched a large-scale production campaign. Thus, on our historical lens, there appeared patch after patch of lush vegetable gardens. A simple shot can evoke a series of memories of those days: on the fields along the Yan River, in the gullies, in front of every cave dwelling, there were tomatoes everywhere. Thousands of hand-cranked spinning wheels were distributed to everyone. We learned to spin cotton and then learned to spin wool, from half an ounce, one ounce to six ounces, seven ounces a day. We overcame difficulties again and again. We were with Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and with the broad masses of the people. We saw Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu in Yan'an (northern Shaanxi), and on every road they had walked, there had been our footprints, the footprints of the people's army carrying red-tasseled spears. The immortal historical lens allows us to see Chairman Mao writing at his desk. The life of this leader of the Chinese people, in a cave dwelling with a white cloth curtain hanging over the door where Chairman Mao once lived, has left an indelible memory in our minds. It makes us understand why we developed such a strong will, and why we won victory in the arduous struggle.

　　The content included in this documentary film "Red Flags Sweep the West Wind" introduces the life and combat in Yan'an (northern Shaanxi), although it is only a part of it, but this part is the most valuable. Its worth is not only in the rare historical materials themselves; but more importantly, it enables us to see the road we have traveled in the face of victory, and enables us not to lose the will to struggle arduously in any victorious environment.

　　看“红旗漫卷西风”

    “红旗漫卷西风”，是一部极可珍贵的革命历史记录影片，因为从它本身的内容来说，从延安（陕北）开始，经过八年抗战，四年人民解放战争，直到全国的大胜利。在这一个革命历史阶段以前，十年内战，二万五千里长征时期，由于当时物质条件的限制，不可能摄制电影记录片，在电影方面，已经是无法弥补的缺陷。至于在全国大胜利这一阶段，我们已有充分的条件拍摄电影，许多伟大的历史场面，已经普遍的在广大的群众中上演，而且今后还会继续拍摄，使中国人民的伟大胜利，真实地展现在全中国以及全世界人民的眼前。因此，只有以延安（陕北）为起点的这一革命阶段，“红旗漫卷西风”为我们在电影方面保留了一部分历史的真实记录。
    “六盘山上高峰，红旗漫卷西风；今日长缨在手，何时缚住苍龙。”今天，当我们诵读着毛泽东同志的诗句，面对着银幕上的六盘山雄姿的镜头，我们的感情，就整个溶化在全部庄严的历史里面。我们一边看着人民解放军在全国胜利的形势下踏过六盘山向西北边疆进军，一边我们好像也看见了雪山，也看见了草地………而在延安（陕北），许多曾经是我们自己所亲身经历的镜头，奇迹一样的出现在我们的面前。
    银幕上的影片一幕一幕的在我们的眼前出现：历史的镜头从千万革命青年所曾经留恋的延安宝塔山下展开。在那开荒的山顶上，那些青草，那些小树，那些曾经为我们的赤脚所踩踏过的泥土……。它使我们记起那些艰苦的年月。清晨带着一个馍馍上山开荒，黄昏回来吃着女同志们采摘的野菜下饭的情景。然而，困难并没有丝毫降低我们的意志。那是一九四三年，在毛主席的号召下，我们展开了大生产。于是，在我们的历史的镜头上，出现了一片一片的丰茂的菜园，一个简单的镜头也会引起我们对于那些日子的一连串的记忆：在延河两岸的田野上，在山沟里，在每一个窑洞的门前，到处是西红柿。千万架手摇的纺车，散布到每一个人的手上。我们学会了纺棉花又学会了纺羊毛，从一天纺半两、一两到六两、七两。我们一次又一次的克服了困难。我们和毛主席、朱总司令在一起，和广大的人民在一起。我们看见了毛主席和朱总司令，在延安（陕北），在他们所走过的每一条道路上，都曾经有过我们的足迹，有过那些扛着红缨枪的人民的队伍的足迹。不朽的历史的镜头，使我们看见了毛主席在案头写作时的情景。毛主席所曾经住过的一间挂着一块白布门帘的窑洞，这一位中国人民的领袖的生活，在我们的脑子里留下了永不磨灭的记忆。它使我们了解，我们为什么会产生那样坚强的意志，我们为什么在艰苦的斗争中获得了胜利。
    “红旗漫卷西风”这一部记录影片所包括的内容，介绍延安（陕北）的生活和战斗的虽然只是其中的一部分，但最可珍贵的也就是这一部分。它的值得珍贵，还不只是在这些难得的历史材料的本身上面；而更重要的是使我们在胜利的面前能够看见我们所曾经走过的道路，能够使我们在任何胜利的环境下都不会消失艰苦斗争的意志。
