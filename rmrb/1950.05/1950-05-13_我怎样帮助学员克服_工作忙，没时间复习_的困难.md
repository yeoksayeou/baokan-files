　　How I Help Students Overcome the Difficulty of "Too Busy with Work, No Time to Review"
　　Tangshan Cadre Spare-time Remedial School, Zhang Xiuzhi

　　Editor's Note: The general office of the Tangshan Municipal Party Committee Cadre Spare-time Cultural Remedial School forwarded this article written by Comrade Zhang Xiuzhi, introducing his teaching experience, especially how to help students overcome the so-called difficulty of "too busy with work, no time to review." Comrade Zhang Xiuzhi's conscientious and responsible spirit, as well as his methods of in-depth investigation and research, close contact with students, organizing students, and inspiring students to consciously and actively learn, are worthy of study by comrades engaged in spare-time education and teaching work in various places. At the same time, comrades participating in spare-time cultural learning in various places can also benefit from this: Although many on-the-job staff in government agencies are busy, they do not really have no time to study, but rather have not made good use of their spare time for learning. I hope everyone will not waste this precious time.

　　I am in charge of the arithmetic course at the Tangshan Cadre Spare-time Cultural School. The initial difficulty I encountered was that the students understood what was taught in class, but forgot it after a few days. When I got to the later lessons, people kept asking questions about the earlier lessons; exercise books were also not always turned in on time. Although I slowed down the pace and took time to review, I still couldn't solve the problem. Soon, I established close relationships with the students and learned about their work situations, personal characteristics, etc. I realized that they were very busy with their work and had very little time for extracurricular review. Some also had to go out on field work, and their learning was inevitably intermittent. For example, comrades from the police station had no fixed working hours during the day and patrolled at night, and had to work the night shift once every other day; district-level comrades had to miss classes because of land reform or other central tasks working in the countryside; comrades from the transportation company often went out with the trucks; and comrades from the trading company often went out to purchase and sell goods. Moreover, comrades from various departments were often transferred, which further increased the difficulties in learning.

　　In addition, I also discovered some favorable conditions: the students were generally tempered by revolution, had a high level of awareness, had an urgent need for culture, and were highly organized, which was a good foundation for solving teaching difficulties. I reported these unfavorable and favorable conditions to the leadership and the research group for discussion, and later discussed them with the students. Finally, everyone agreed that we should do the following:

　　1. Find ways to enable students who missed classes to catch up with the missed lessons in a timely manner.

　　2. Minimize avoidable absences.

　　3. Increase students' interest in learning so that people who are busy with work and do not have whole blocks of time can consciously use fragmented time to study.

　　　　　　First Organize
　　I did as everyone suggested, starting with "organizing." In the class I taught—Senior Second Class C—all fifty-four students were freely formed into six groups according to the distance of their addresses, and a class leader and group leaders were democratically elected; in the eight units I was responsible for tutoring, groups were also formed and group leaders or study committee members were elected (the elections were conducted after publicity and mobilization, leaders' mobilization, and then a general meeting, with methods such as competition and comparison of conditions, to elect comrades who were active in learning, had prestige, and were responsible as group leaders).

　　After being organized, the class and group leaders had a sense of responsibility and took the lead in encouraging others. Students who were poor in their studies and had fallen behind also had ways to catch up, because:

　　(1) A "little teacher" system was automatically established: For example, Wu Mingqi and Xu Wenxiang from the No. 1 Police Station of the No. 3 Sub-bureau often spent half a day (Sundays or evenings) helping comrades who were poor in their studies.

　　(2) The situation was systematically reflected, and the teaching method was improved: At the joint meeting of class and group leaders, everyone reflected that the little teachers did not know where to start or how to teach. I improved the teaching method as follows: In arithmetic class, pay attention to analyzing the reasoning, make concise notes on the calculation methods, and give a few general typical examples for reference after class; after teaching a section, take some time to review using the group discussion method, mainly discussing the arithmetic calculation methods and reasoning; during the discussion, students with higher levels explain to students with lower levels so that everyone can understand, and strive to teach one lesson and understand one lesson; and often give a few small questions related to actual situations for practice to strengthen memory. Doing this not only made it possible for the little teachers to teach, but also the students all said: "It is convenient to review." For example, Comrade He Yuanming from the Municipal Party Committee had to miss classes for two weeks due to work; before leaving, he asked me to explain the "reasons," "main methods," and "typical examples" clearly, and took the exercises with him to do when he had time. After finishing, he asked someone to bring them to me for correction. In this way, he worked outside for two weeks, and his lessons were not delayed.

　　(3) Expanded the scope of contact, making it easier to scientifically allocate time and provide timely guidance: For example, before the Transportation Company was organized into groups, only two comrades attached great importance to learning. When I went to their office to contact the students, I often only contacted these two people; some people said that the tutor was "biased." Later, they formed the twenty-two comrades in the entire office who participated in cultural learning into three groups, and also elected a study committee member, and stipulated the review time for comrades attending evening and morning classes. In this way, I was able to contact all the comrades and help them. Moreover, at the same time, I could plan which office should be visited more often and which less often, which office could be taught by little teachers, and which person should put in special effort.

　　Reducing avoidable absences was also done through learning organizations. The group of the No. 4 Police Station of the No. 3 Sub-bureau adopted the "work exchange" method: if the work of those attending evening classes was not finished, the comrades attending morning classes would help them do it; if those attending morning classes had work, those attending evening classes would take their place. In the past, comrades often arrived late. Miao Yihe came up with a method: if anyone was late, the whole class would criticize them; and the group leader would understand the reason for the lateness and help solve it.

　　　　　　Inspire to Seize Fragmented Time

　　Regarding the issue of interest, according to my understanding, most of those who are not interested in their studies are because they do not do their homework, and if they do not do their homework, they will not understand, and if they do not understand, they will not be interested. As long as the methods mentioned above are done well, there will be achievements in learning, and naturally there will be interest. The comrades of the No. 4 Police Station of the No. 3 Sub-bureau are a typical example: in the beginning, they kept shouting that they were too busy with work and could not review. Some comrades even said: "Anyway, I know that it is not good to not do my work well, but it won't matter much if I don't study well." I talked to him about how learning is precisely for doing a good job. I asked him what difficulties he had in learning, and he said: "Arithmetic is the most difficult, there is no time to do it and it is not related to reality, so I am not interested." I explained to him that everything in daily life cannot be separated from arithmetic, such as having a plan for allocating work, and writing summaries cannot be separated from numbers, which all require arithmetic; as for interest, it is necessary to study hard to find it, and as long as you study diligently, you will of course be interested. In this way, their confidence in learning was slowly boosted. Once in the afternoon, I went to their office and found them resting. I asked: "Didn't you say you didn't have time?" They said that they had just mediated a fight and a divorce dispute, and the villagers had just left, and people would come in a while. I seized this opportunity to calculate the time with them, and found that the time accumulated from these twenty minutes and half hours was at least two hours a day. I said: "It is a pity to waste this time." After that, they seized these fragmented times to review; they also formed groups, and I often took time to help them catch up on their lessons. After a period of time, the previous exercises were all made up, and their enthusiasm for learning was also high. Now, every time I go to their office, I no longer see anyone chatting. In addition to talking cordially with the villagers and going out to work, the comrades are always consciously studying. They also use the time when they work the night shift to do exercises and write essays. In this way, their daily life is very happy, and they are no longer "burdened" by learning. In this term exam, out of the nine people in their group, two people took first and second place, and the overall average of eight people was above 80 points. Zhang Zhimin's exam results were very poor last year, but this year's average score reached 86 points.

　　我怎样帮助学员克服“工作忙，没时间复习”的困难
    唐山干部业余补习学校　张秀芝
    编者按：唐山市委干部业余文化补习学校总校部转来张秀芝同志所写的这篇文章，介绍了他的教学经验，特别是如何帮助学员克服所谓“工作忙，没时间复习”的困难。张秀芝同志这种认真负责的精神，以及他所用的深入调查研究，密切联系学员，组织学员，启发学员自觉地积极学习的方法，值得各地从事业余教育教学工作的同志们学习。同时，各地参加业余文化学习的同志也可以在此得到教益：许多机关的在职工作人员工作虽忙，但并不是真正没有时间学习，而是没有把空余的时间好好利用于学习。希望大家不要浪费了这些宝贵的时间。
    我在唐山市干部业余文化学校担任算术课程。最初遇到的困难，是学员们当场听懂了，但过几天就忘记了。讲到后面，不断地还有人提出前面讲过的功课中的问题；练习本也老是交不齐。虽然放慢速度，抽时间复习，还是解决不了问题。不久，我和学员们建立了密切的关系，对他们的工作情况，个人性格等加以了解，才知道他们工作很忙，课外复习时间很少，有的还要出外勤，学习不免时断时续。如派出所同志白天工作无定时，晚上巡逻，每隔一天还要值夜班一次；区级同志，因土地改革或其他中心任务下乡工作，就得误课；运输公司的同志常出外跟车；贸易公司的同志常出外购销货物。而且各部门同志又时常调动工作，更增加了学习中的困难。
    另外，也发现了一些有利的条件：学员同志一般都是经过革命锻炼的，觉悟高，对文化有迫切要求，组织性强，这是解决教学上困难的很好的基础。我就把这些不利和有利的条件，提到领导上和研究小组讨论，后来又找同学商量，最后大家认为应该这样作：
    一、设法使缺课的同学能及时补上所缺的功课。
    二、尽量减少可以避免的缺课。
    三、提高同学们的学习兴趣，使因为工作忙，没有整段空时间的人，能自觉地利用零碎时间学习。
            首先组织起来
    我就照着大家的意见做，首先从“组织起来”着手。在我教的那班——高二丙，把全班五十四人，按地址远近，自由结为六组，民主选出班长、组长；在我负责辅导的八个单位中，也编了组，选了组长或学委（选举是经过宣传酝酿，首长动员，然后开大会，以竞选、比条件等方式，选出学习积极、有威信、负责任的同志作组长）。
    组织起来后，班组长有了责任感，处处起带头鼓动作用，功课差和有耽误的同学也有法补上功课了，因为：
    （一）自动搞起了“小先生”制：如三分局一派出所吴鸣歧和许文祥，常用半天功夫（星期日或晚上）帮助功课差的同志学习。
    （二）有系统地反映了情况，改进了教学法：在班组长联席会上，大家反映当小先生不知从何说起，如何教法。我就把教学法改进如下：上算术课时，注意分析理由，把运算方法作成扼要笔记，举几个一般性的典型例题，以备课后参考；讲过一段后，抽出一定时间，利用小组讨论法复习，主要讨论算术运算方法与理由；讨论时，程度高的给程度低的讲解，使大家都能领会，力求作到讲一课，懂一课；并时常出几个与实际有关的小题作练习，以加强记忆。这样一做，不但小先生有法教了，同学们都说：“复习起来便当了”。如市委会何元明同志，因工作要缺课两星期；行前，他找我把“理由”、“主要方法”、“典型例题”讲明白，带着习题下去，抽空就作。作完托人带给我，给他改正。这样，他外出工作两星期，功课并没有耽搁。
    （三）扩大了接触面，便于科学地分配时间，及时指导：如运输公司在未编组前，只有两位同志非常重视学习。我到他们机关与学员联系时，经常接触的也只是他们两人；有人就说导师“偏心眼”。后来他们把全机关参加文化学习的二十二位同志组成三组，还选了学委，并规定晚班、早班上课同志的复习时间。这样，我就能和全体同志接触，帮助他们了。而且，在同时可以计划那个机关该多去、少去，那个机关叫小先生教就行，那个人该特别下功夫。
    关于减少可避免的缺课，也是通过学习组织做的。三分局四派出所小组，采取了“变工”的办法：上晚课的工作没作完，上早课的同志就帮他做；上早课的有工作时，上晚课的就替他。以前常有同志迟到，苗义和想出办法：谁若迟到，全班就给以批评；并由组长了解迟到原因，帮助解决。
            启发抓紧零碎时间
    关于兴趣问题，据我了解，一些对功课不感兴趣的，多半是由于不做功课，不做功课就不会，不会就没有兴趣。只要把上面所说的办法做好，学习有成绩，自然就有了兴趣。三分局四派出所的同志就是一个典型的例子：他们开头也尽喊工作忙，不能复习。还有同志说：“反正我知道工作做不好不行，学习不好还不致怎样”。我就和他谈学习正是为了做好工作。问他学习上有什么困难，他说：“算术最感困难，没时间作又不联系实际，不感兴趣。”我就给他解释日常生活一切都离不了算术，如工作时要有计划分配，写总结离不开数目字，这都需要算术；至于兴趣是要自己去研究，才能找到的，只要勤学，当然会有兴趣。这样慢慢鼓起了他们学习的信心。有一次下午，我到他们机关，发现他们正在休息。我就问：“你们不是说没有时间吗？”他们说才调解了一桩打架、一桩离婚的纠纷，老乡刚走，呆一会就有人来。我就抓住这个机会和他们算了一下账，结果发现这样二十分、半拉钟头累积下来的时间，每天至少有两个钟头。我说：“这时间浪费了多可惜。”以后，他们就抓住这些零碎时间复习了；并编了组，我也时常抽时间去替他们补功课。这样过了一个时期，以前的习题都补上了，他们的学习情绪也高了。现在我每次去他们机关，再没见过有人谈天，除与老乡们和蔼地谈问题或出外工作外，同志们总是自觉地在学习着。他们还利用晚上值夜班的时间来作习题、作作文。这样，他们每天的生活很愉快，不再因学习“背包袱”了。这次期考，他们组九个人，有两个人考第一、第二，八个人总平均在八十分以上。张志民在去年考试成绩很不好，今年的平均分达到了八十六分。
