　　The working class consciousness increases, and activists emerge continuously.
    Various public factories and mines continuously set new records.
    [Report from this newspaper] Under the leadership and education of the Party and the trade union, the workers and staff of public factories in Beijing have brought into play the creative spirit of the working class and have produced many new production records.

    In the past, the highest coal mining rate per worker at the Mentougou Coal Mine was 0.52 tons, but recently it has been increased to 0.66 tons. The mine is now making every effort to mobilize workers, abolish the feudal foreman system, and implement democratic management in order to better unleash the enthusiasm for production.

    The China People's Printing Factory's annual production last year exceeded the plan by an average of 14.83 percent, and the production efficiency of some departments was doubled compared with the Kuomintang rule. In the first quarter of this year, the factory's production volume exceeded the new production quota, and the waste rate dropped from 5.6 percent at the end of last year to 3.775 percent at the end of March this year.

    The production efficiency of the Beijing Garment Factory has increased by 30 to 40 percent compared with the Kuomintang rule; and a large amount of raw materials has been saved. This year, the factory completed the task of one million sets of single clothes, saving 1.2 million square feet of cloth, which can be used to make 36,810 sets of single clothes.

    The main reasons for the increase in production efficiency in these factories are, first of all, the increased awareness of the working class, which has enhanced labor efficiency. For example, Zhang Guozhu, a worker in the intaglio printing department of the China People's Printing Factory, printed 625 sheets per hour in May last year, and increased to 950 sheets per hour in March this year, an increase of 52 percent in production efficiency; the waste rate dropped from 4 percent to 2 percent. He Zhongkang, driver No. 18 of the tram company, did not break down his car once in 50 days, did not cause an accident, and was never late. Liu Shengjia of the tram company's boiler room led the workers to clean the boiler that had not been cleaned for eleven years, removing more than 400 kilograms of scale. Liu Hengwen, a special-grade model worker at the automobile repair factory, broke the quota of nine pistons per worker, and the highest output reached 38, driving the workers to raise the standard quota to 28.

    The second reason for the increase in productivity is that the factories have carried out rationalization proposal campaigns, promoted the creativity of the working class, and thus improved production technology and machinery and equipment. For example, Liu Mengxin, a case worker at the tram company, invented an electric cylinder, which increased work efficiency eight times. Fu Wanyu, a worker at the Sixth Institute of the 70th Ordnance Factory, invented a new milling cutter, which increased the output of three-jaw chucks by nine times. Wang Zhonghe, a worker at the automobile repair factory, researched and improved the machine, which increased the output of pressing glue from 25 pounds per day for two people to 60 pounds per day for one person. The entire team overfulfilled the task, and he was elected as a special-grade labor model. Zhou Yueting, a carpenter at the Agricultural Machinery General Factory, invented a water-saving device for sawing wood, which saved half the working hours for making seed selection machines compared to the original. Jiao Changhai, a 60-year-old worker at the China People's Printing Factory (elected as a member of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions), invented the pressure wheel spring of the numbering machine, and transformed the pressure wheel picking teeth and other parts, replacing manual work with machines, which greatly improved the production quantity and quality. In addition, such as the garment factory workers creating ninety-five shuttles, repairing electric clippers by themselves, the 70th ordnance factory worker Wang Qian creating a detonator top pit tool, the Chengzi Mine's special-grade production model creating an oil-filled electric switch, and the Heishan Branch Mine's special-grade production model imitating a fifty-horsepower switch bleeder, etc., have all played a great role in improving production efficiency and reducing costs.

### 工人阶级觉悟提高积极分子不断涌现  各公营厂矿连创新纪录

　　工人阶级觉悟提高积极分子不断涌现
    各公营厂矿连创新纪录
    【本报讯】北京市各公营工厂职工在党与工会领导教育下，发挥了工人阶级的创造精神，产生许多生产新纪录。
    门头沟煤矿过去每工最高采煤率为零点五二吨，最近已提高至零点六六吨。该矿现正全力发动工人，废除封建把头制度，实行民主管理，以便更高的发挥生产积极性。
    中国人民印刷厂去年全年生产平均超过计划百分之十四点八三，有的部门的生产效率比国民党统治时提高了一倍。今年第一季，该厂生产数量超过新的产量定额，作废率则从去年年底的百分之五点六降至今年三月底的百分之三点七七五。
    北京被服厂的生产效率比国民党统治时期提高了百分之三十至四十；而且节省了大量的原料。该厂今年完成了百万套单服的任务，节省布匹一百二十万方尺，可做单衣三万六千八百一十套。
    这些工厂中生产效率提高的主要原因，首先是工人阶级觉悟提高，增强了劳动效率。如中国人民印刷厂凹印股工人张国柱，去年五月份每小时印件六百二十五张，今年三月份每小时增至九百五十张，生产效率提高了百分之五十二；作废率则由百分之四降至百分之二。电车公司十八号司机何仲康，五十天没有坏过一次车，没有闯过一次祸，没有一次迟到。电车公司锅炉房刘盛甲带动工人清洗了十一年来没有清洗过的锅炉，清除水锈四百余斤。汽车修配厂特等模范刘恒文，做活塞打破每工九个的定额，最高产量曾达三十八个，带动工人提高标准定额至二十八个。
    生产率提高的第二个原因，是由于各厂开展了合理化建议运动，发扬了工人阶级的创造性，因之改进了生产技术与机器设备。如电车公司案工刘梦新发明电缸，提高工作效率八倍。七十兵工厂六所工人傅万煜发明新铣刀，使三不卡盘产量提高九倍。汽车修配厂工人王忠和研究改进机器，使压胶由二人日产二十五磅增至一人日产六十磅。整个小组超额完成任务，他被选为特等劳动模范。农业机械总厂木工周月亭发明锯木材的省水器，使做选种机的工时比原来节省一半。中国人民印刷厂六十岁老工人焦常海（被选为市总工会委员），发明了号码机的压轮片簧，又改造了压轮扒齿等零件，以机器代替手工，也大大提高了生产数量与质量。此外，如被服厂工人创造九五梭头，自己修理电剪子，七十兵工厂工人王谦创造雷管顶坑工具，城子矿特等生产模范创造油入电动开关，黑山分矿特等生产模范仿造五十马力开关泄力等，对提高生产效率，减低成本，都起了很大作用。
