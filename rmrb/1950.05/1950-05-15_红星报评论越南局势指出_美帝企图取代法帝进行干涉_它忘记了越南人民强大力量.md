Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 13th: A Red Star newspaper observer wrote an article commenting on the situation in Vietnam, stating: The bloody "dirty war" against the Vietnamese people, costing $500 million annually, has exhausted France's budget. The expeditionary force has suffered 150,000 casualties.

This year, the heroic army of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has dealt the French army a crushing blow. Currently, the position of the French army is becoming increasingly worse. At present, the French occupiers only occupy a few cities along the coast, while the rest of the country has been liberated.

*Le Monde*, which is close to the French Foreign Ministry, stated on May 3rd: It is quite obvious that there are only two paths to take: either the United States immediately provides France with resolute assistance in this war, or the French government will be forced to stop further fighting due to lack of funds.

As expected, the U.S. imperialists immediately "agreed." The United States promised to give France loans and provide free military supplies in order to "restore stability" in Vietnam; or, to put it another way, to establish American rule in Vietnam. Therefore, the U.S. militarists will henceforth exclusively and comprehensively direct all measures used to combat the Vietnamese national liberation struggle.

It is no accident that Acheson, despite Schuman's opposition, insisted that American arms supplies should be given not only to France, but also directly to Bao Dai's puppet "government." Relying on the help of this traitor, the American aggressors want to repeat in Vietnam what they have done in Greece, preparing the ground for open American intervention. The Vietnamese people will realize that the U.S. imperialists will bring them new oppression and enslavement, massacres, and the terror of concentration camps.

However, when implementing their aggressive plans, the Franco-American colonialists have not taken into account that the Vietnamese people, like other peace-loving Asian people, are increasingly strengthening their power and determination to resist the massacres of the Franco-American colonialists. The imperialists have not noticed the powerful movement of peace supporters demanding an end to the "dirty war" in Vietnam.

　　红星报评论越南局势指出
　　美帝企图取代法帝进行干涉
    它忘记了越南人民强大力量
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：红星报观察家撰文评论越南的局势称：每年耗费五亿美元以反对越南人民的血腥“肮脏的战争”，耗尽了法国的预算。远征军的损失死伤已达十五万。
    今年，越南民主共和国英勇的军队，给了法国军队以粉碎性的打击。目前，法军的地位已愈来愈恶劣了。目前，法国占领者仅占领了沿海的几座城市，而全国的其他各地都解放了。
    接近法国外交部的《世界报》在五月三日称：十分明显，只有两条道路可走：或者是美国在这个战争中立即给予法国坚决的援助，不然，就是法国政府由于没有钱而被迫停止作进一步的斗争。
    果然不出意料，美帝国主义者立即“答应了”。美国答应给法国贷款，免费供给军火，以便在越南“恢复稳定”；或者换一个说法，就是要在越南建立美国的统治。因此，美国军国主义者今后将单独地全盘指挥所有用来打击越南民族解放斗争的措施。
    艾奇逊不顾舒曼的反对，坚持美国的武器供应不仅应给法国，而且也应直接给保大的傀儡“政府”，这并不是偶然的事。依赖着这个卖国贼的帮助，美国的侵略者想在越南重复他们所曾在希腊干过的那一套，为美国的公开干涉准备基础。越南人民将会认识到，美帝国主义者将带给他们以新的压迫与奴役，大批的屠杀与集中营的恐怖。
    然而，法美殖民者们在实行他们的侵略计划时，没有考虑到越南人民也象其他争取和平的亚洲人民一样，他们抵抗法美殖民者屠杀的力量与决心是与日俱增的。帝国主义者们并未注意到要求停止越南“肮脏的战争”的和平支持者的有力的运动。
