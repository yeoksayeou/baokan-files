　　Zhangjiakou Alcohol Factory Continuously Sets New Records
　　Trade Union Plays a Guarantee Role
　　Trade Union Focuses on Production
    [Our Newspaper] During the first quarter of production, the state-owned Zhangjiakou Alcohol Factory in Chahar Province continuously set ten new records, overfulfilling its production plan. The achievement of this result is inseparable from the improvement of the factory's trade union work. The factory re-elected its trade union committee at the end of last year, clarified the idea of the trade union focusing on production, and gained experience in leading production in actual practice.

    Before the start of the first quarter's new record-setting campaign, the trade union conducted ideological mobilization and organizational preparations among the workers to transform the administratively stipulated production plan into a mass production plan. The factory's production plan and various systems were jointly formulated by the administration and the trade union. Initially, some workers still had many ideological concerns. For example, the production committee member was afraid that the plan to cook four pots (previously only three pots were cooked) would fail and that he would be punished. After the establishment of the foreman system, workers were afraid to become foremen, fearing that they could not bear the responsibility and would offend people. At this time, the trade union carried out extensive propaganda and education work among the workers through various means. It led the various workshops to formulate production plans and guarantee conditions. For example, the raw material room guaranteed to clean the raw materials thoroughly; the saccharification room guaranteed not to cook raw sorghum; the boiler room guaranteed standard gas usage. On the basis of each workshop's plan, all relevant units were mobilized to sign contact contracts. Workers clarified their goals and working methods, and their confidence and morale were improved. The trade union's grassroots organizations also changed accordingly. In the past, they were mixed groups, but now they have been changed to workshop groups. Production secretaries and joint meetings were also established to directly promote and lead the production work of their respective units. The competition movement was launched on an organized and prepared basis.

    After the launch of the movement, the central links of the trade union's work were: grasping the production situation and strengthening propaganda and mobilization. On January 16, a record of cooking four pots appeared, and the trade union immediately posted a bulletin of good news and vigorously publicized it through wall newspapers and blackboards. The director of the provincial trade union personally came to the factory to congratulate them. The workers were overjoyed, and their enthusiasm for competition was even higher. In order to strengthen production mobilization, each workshop group added secretaries for culture and education, blackboard newspapers, wall newspapers, and communications broadcasting, and appointed the chief of the engineering section to participate in the publicity work, timely commending various heroic model deeds and figures in production, and introducing advanced experiences. Regular evaluations of models and celebrations of achievements were also held, and material rewards were given, which effectively promoted the development of the movement.

### 张垣酒精厂连创新纪录　工会发挥保证作用　工会面向生产

　　张垣酒精厂连创新纪录
　　工会发挥保证作用         
　　工会面向生产
    【本报讯】察哈尔省营张垣酒精厂，在第一季生产过程中，连创十次新纪录，超额完成生产计划。这种成绩的获得，是和该厂工会工作的改进分不开的。该厂在去年年底改选了工会委员，明确了工会面向生产的思想，在实际运动中，获得了领导生产的经验。
    在第一季创新纪录运动开始以前，工会就在工人群众中进行思想动员和组织准备，以便把行政上规定的生产计划，变为群众的生产计划。该厂的生产计划和各种制度，是行政和工会协同制订的。最初，部分工人还有许多思想顾虑，如生产委员怕煮四锅（过去仅煮三锅）的计划失败了，自己要受处罚。建立领班制后，工人不敢当领班，怕负不了责任，怕得罪人。这时，工会通过各种方式，在工人中进行了广泛的宣传教育工作。领导各个车间，订立了生产计划和保证条件。如原料室保证把原料打干净；糖化室保证不煮生高粱；锅炉房保证标准用气。在各车间订计划的基础上，发动各有关单位，订立了联系合同。工人明确了努力目标和工作方法，信心和情绪都提高了。工会的基层组织也随之改变，过去是混合编组，现在改为车间小组。还设立了生产干事和联席会议，直接推动和领导本单位的生产工作。竞赛运动在有组织有准备的基础上开展起来了。
    运动开展之后，工会工作的中心环节是：掌握生产情况，加强宣传鼓动工作。一月十六日出现了煮四锅的纪录，工会立即张贴喜报，并通过墙报、黑板报大力宣传。省工会主任亲至该厂贺喜。工友们欢欣鼓舞，竞赛热情愈加高涨。为加强生产鼓动工作，各车间小组增设了文教、黑板报、墙报、通讯广播等干事，并约聘工务科长参加宣传工作，及时表扬生产中的各种英模事迹和人物，介绍先进经验。并定期举行评模庆功，发给物质奖励，有力的推进了运动的发展。（察省总工会）
