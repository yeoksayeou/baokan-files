　　Jiangxi Yujiang and Two Other Counties Fully Launch Rent Reduction and Spring Farming
    [Nanchang News] According to the Jiangxi Daily, Yujiang, Qianshan, and Guangfeng counties in the Shangrao Special District of Jiangxi Province have fully launched rent reduction and return, as well as spring agricultural production. Before the implementation of rent reduction and return, all counties generally lacked food and seeds, especially Guangfeng County, where the spring famine was even more severe, greatly impacting spring planting. Since the government launched rent reduction and return, clearing of outstanding public grain debts, opening of public granaries, and liquidation of corruption, the fruits obtained have basically solved the livelihood and production difficulties of the masses. According to incomplete statistics from 180 Bao in Yujiang County alone, the returned rent grain, together with the cleared outstanding public grain debts and corrupt grain, totaled more than 77,000 catties, and more than 3,300 catties of rice. In Guangfeng County, 100 Bao alone unearthed more than 8,000 catties of grain hidden by bandits. Due to the victory of the struggle and the government's issuance of agricultural loans, the problem of food and seeds has been basically solved, and the masses' production enthusiasm in various counties has been greatly increased, actively carrying out spring planting. In Yujiang County, among the 367,000 mu of cultivated land, except for wheat and rapeseed fields, the remaining dry land has been sown, and late rice fields are being actively plowed and harrowed, and more than 1,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed. Qianshan County has a cultivated land area of 334,213 mu. Except for wheat and rapeseed fields, a total of 279,700 mu of dry land (missing two districts) have been plowed and sown, of which more than 147,560 mu have been harrowed, which can ensure that the land cultivated last year will not be barren. Dry land in Guangfeng County is being actively sown, and more than 2,000 mu of wasteland have been reclaimed in the county. In order to improve this year's production, the masses in various counties, under the organization and leadership of the government and with the assistance of loans, have also participated in water conservancy projects. Yujiang County has repaired six large dams, benefiting 12,970 mu of farmland; 199 small dams (five of which have not been completed), benefiting 98,066 mu of farmland; 336 reservoirs, benefiting 64,658 mu of farmland, and 163 canals, with a total length of 140 li. Qianshan County has completed or rushed to repair 18 large dams and 202 small dams, and another 17 can be completed by mid-May. According to local farmers' estimates, these water conservancy projects can benefit more than 33,400 mu of farmland this year. Guangfeng County has completed large and small dikes, large and small dams, water stations, and lakes, benefiting approximately 27,270 mu of farmland. Although the counties have achieved many results, they have not been thorough enough. For example, in Guangfeng County, due to impure cadres, the work of rent reduction and return has stagnated at the current stage, so the problem of food for the masses has not been completely solved. Only by thoroughly implementing rent reduction and return can the spring famine be overcome and spring agricultural production be carried out well. It is hoped that the local leadership should conduct in-depth inspections and corrections.

　　江西余江等三个县减租春耕全面展开
    【南昌讯】据江西日报消息：江西上饶专区余江、铅山、广丰三县全面展开减租退租和春耕生产。各县在未实行减租退租以前，普遍缺粮缺种，尤其是广丰县的春荒更为严重，对春耕生产有很大影响。自政府发动减租退租、清理公粮尾欠、义仓积谷和清算贪污以后，所得果实，基本上解决了群众生活和生产上的困难。仅据余江县一百八十个保的不完全统计，退回租谷连同清理公粮尾欠及贪污稻谷共达七万七千多斤，大米三千三百多斤。广丰县一百个保仅挖出匪藏粮一项就达八千多斤。由于斗争的胜利和政府发放农贷，口粮与种籽问题基本上获得解决，各该县群众生产情绪大大提高，积极进行春耕播种。余江县耕地三十六万七千余亩当中，除麦田和油菜田，其余旱田都已播种，晚田也在积极犁耙，并开垦荒地一千多亩。铅山县耕地面积三十三万四千二百一十三亩，除麦田和油菜田外，已耕犁和播种的旱田（缺两个区）共有二十七万九千七百余亩，其中耙过的有十四万七千五百六十多亩，可以保证去年耕过的田不荒。广丰县的旱田在积极播种中，该县荒地已开垦二千余亩。各该县群众，为搞好今年生产，在政府组织、领导和贷款的扶助下，还参加了兴修水利工程。余江县已修复大坝六个，受益田亩一万二千九百七十亩；小坝一百九十九个（尚有五个未完成），受益田亩九万八千零六十六亩；水塘三百三十六个，受益田亩六万四千六百五十八亩，水圳一百六十三条，共计长度一百四十华里。铅山县已修竣或赶修的大坝十八个，小坝二百零二个，还有十七个到五月中旬可以完成。这些水利工程，依照当地农民估计，今年受益田亩可达三万三千四百余亩。广丰县修竣大小圩堤、大小水坝、水车站、湖等，受益田亩约二万七千二百七十亩。各该县虽然获得不少成绩，但作得还不够深入，如广丰县由于干部不纯，致使减租退租工作停滞在现阶段上，因此群众的口粮问题尚未彻底解决。只有彻底实行减租退租，春荒才能克服，春耕生产才能得以很好进行，望当地领导上应深入检查与纠正。
