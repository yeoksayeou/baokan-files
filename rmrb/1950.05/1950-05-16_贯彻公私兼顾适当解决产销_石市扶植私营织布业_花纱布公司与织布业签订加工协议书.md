　　Implementing Public-Private Partnership and Appropriately Resolving Production and Sales
　　Shijiazhuang Supports Private Weaving Industry
    Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company Signs Processing Agreement with Weaving Industry
    [Report from our Shijiazhuang Office] In order to implement the principle of public-private partnership, appropriately resolve current production and sales issues, and support the private textile industry in a planned manner, the Shijiazhuang Branch of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has signed a processing agreement with the private weaving industry. With bank loans and the support of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, the private weaving industry in Shijiazhuang has grown from only 143 manual looms in July of last year (with only 83 actually operating) to the current number of 34 power looms with iron frames (27 already operating), 92 power looms with wooden frames (81 already operating), and 126 manual looms. In March and April, the Shijiazhuang Branch of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, recognizing that the relationship between the supply and demand of cloth had undergone new changes after the national financial and economic unification, decided to sign processing contracts with the weaving industry based on the principle of public-private partnership to achieve a reasonable solution to the industry's production and sales problems. As of April 15, statistics showed that contracts had been signed with the company for 27 power looms with iron frames, 74 power looms with wooden frames, and 78 manual looms. However, because the processing fees were not appropriate (in the past, the processing fee was 49 catties of yarn exchanged for cloth, or 46 catties for manual work using yarn, with the former accounting for more than 85%, so the average processing fee was 48 catties per bolt, equivalent to 45,600 yuan. Each bolt of cloth used 22.3 yards of 20-count fine yarn, equivalent to 185,100 yuan, plus factory tax, stamp tax, sales commission, freight, and operating expenses of 15,000 yuan, the cost per bolt reached 245,700 yuan. However, the listed price for 20-count plain white cloth was only 240,000 yuan, resulting in a loss of 5,700 yuan per bolt), negotiations were held on April 18, and the agreement was formally signed on April 19. The main contents of the agreement are: 1. Power looms with iron frames will continue to be developed in the future, while the number of power looms with wooden frames will be maintained at the current level without further development, and manual looms will stop processing. 2. The processing fee per bolt will be 43 catties for power looms with iron frames and 40 catties for power looms with wooden frames. 3. Assist manual looms in switching to the production of striped cloth and mosquito net cloth, and the company will allocate cotton yarn at a discounted price. The agreement stipulates that the effective period is two months. After the agreement was reached, contracts were signed for 27 power looms with iron frames and 85 power looms with wooden frames, with a monthly output of 4,680 bolts of cloth.

    花纱布公司与织布业签订加工协议书
    【本报石家庄讯】为贯彻公私兼顾，适当解决目前产销问题，有计划地扶植私营纺织工业，石家庄花纱布分公司与私营织布业签订加工协议书。石市私营织布业在银行贷款与花纱布公司的扶植下，从去年七月仅有人力机一四三台（实际开工者仅八十三台），发展到目前为止已有铁电机三十四台（已开动二十七台），木电机九十二台（已开动八十一台），人力机一二六台。三、四月间石市花纱布分公司因鉴于全国财经统一后，布的供求关系已发生了新的变化，为使该业产销问题获得合理解决，遂决定本公私兼顾原则分别与织布业订立加工合同。截至四月十五日统计，曾与该公司订立合同者有铁电机二十七台，木电机七十四台，人力机七十八台。又因加工费用不太合适（过去每匹加工费以纱换布为四十九斤，领纱作手工者四十六斤，其中以纱换布者占百分之八十五以上，故平均加工费为每匹四十八斤，折款四五、六○○元。每匹布用二十支细纱二二·三码，折款一八五、一○○元，再加货物出厂税、印花税、代卖手续费、运费、经营费用等一五、○○○元，每匹成本达二四五、七○○元。而所织二十支纱白细布牌价只二四○、○○○元，每匹布即赔五、七○○元），于四月十八日，进行协议，十九日正式签订协议书。协议书主要内容是：一、铁电机今后仍继续发展，木电机维持现有数量不再发展，人力木机停止加工。二、每匹加工费铁电机为四十三斤，木电机四十斤。三、扶助人力木机转营条布及蚊帐布，公司以折价办法配售棉纱。协议书规定有效期间为两个月。协议成立后即订立合同，订立机数计有：铁电机二十七台，木电机八十五台，每月产布四、六八○匹。
