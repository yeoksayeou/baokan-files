    IV. Pink Bollworm
    The pink bollworm, also known as the red worm or cotton bollworm, is the most serious pest during the cotton flowering period, widely distributed, with the cotton-growing areas of central and southern China being particularly affected. It occurs two to five times a year, depending on climate variations in different regions, overwintering as mature larvae inside cotton seeds or bolls. The following spring, in late spring and early summer, it pupates into moths and lays eggs. After hatching, the larvae burrow into flower buds or bolls to feed. Infested flower buds soon fall off. Some have already formed small bolls, but if severely damaged, they also fall off soon after. The pink bollworms that burrow into the bolls penetrate the cotton fibers and feed on the seeds. As a result, the bolls cannot open properly. Even if one or two fibers are undamaged, the quality of the cotton is impaired. Infested cotton seeds are not suitable for planting or oil extraction. If there is heavy rain in summer and autumn, bacteria can easily enter through the damaged areas, causing most of the bolls to rot, resulting in serious losses. The period of greatest damage is from July to September. The following is a brief description of the prevention methods:
    (I) Preventive Measures: The following preventive measures require everyone's participation to be effective. (1) Clean the field: Some pink bollworms overwinter in fallen fruits and withered leaves in the cotton field. Therefore, after the cotton harvest, the fallen fruits and withered leaves should be collected and burned. (2) Pull and burn cotton stalks early: The green bolls and dry petals remaining on the cotton plants harbor many pink bollworms. The cotton stalks should be pulled out before the frost and burned completely before the Qingming Festival (Tomb-Sweeping Day). (3) Process seed cotton: After the cotton harvest, it should be exposed to the sun frequently. The insects hiding in the cotton seeds will crawl out when heated and be eaten by chickens. After several times, most of the insects can be eliminated.
    (II) Spraying 10% DDT powder or 10% DDT sulfur powder: During the pink bollworm outbreak period from July to September, spray 10% DDT powder or 10% DDT sulfur powder once every 20 to 30 days on clear, windless mornings or evenings using a powder duster. This is very effective in controlling pink bollworms. Apply one to three catties of insecticide per mu.
    (III) Spraying Lead Arsenate Solution: Spray lead arsenate solution once a month from July to September using a sprayer. The mixing ratio is one catty of lead arsenate to 200 catties of water. Apply 200 to 300 catties per mu.
    (IV) Picking up Fallen Flowers and Fruits: During the peak cotton flowering period in July, pick up the infested flower buds from the cotton plants every morning and collect the fallen flowers and fruits on the ground and burn them. Repeat this every ten days until mid-September to kill many pink bollworms.
    V. Cotton Bollworm
    The cotton bollworm, also known as the flower worm or stem borer, causes the most damage in the coastal provinces and cotton-growing areas of Sichuan, followed by the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and southwestern cotton-growing areas, with lighter damage in North China. It damages the cotton plant's tender shoots, tender stems, tender leaves, flower buds, and young bolls. In the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, it has four generations per year. The first generation of larvae appears in late June, the second generation in mid-July, the third generation in late August, and the fourth generation in late September. The newly hatched larvae damage the tender shoots and leaves of the cotton plant, then bore into the stems to feed, or enter through a round hole at the base of the flower bud, damaging its important parts. Slightly larger larvae mostly damage the flowers and bolls, boring a hole into the boll at the bracts to feed. After eating the contents, they crawl out to damage other flower buds or young bolls. Infested buds and bolls soon fall off. The period of greatest damage is from mid-July to mid-September. The control methods are as follows:
    (I) Picking Cotton Shoots: The adult cotton bollworms prefer to lay eggs on the tender shoots of the cotton plant. This habit can be exploited by picking the tender shoots during their occurrence. Special attention should be paid to protruding cotton heads or cotton fields near residences. The picked shoots should be burned or buried deep in the soil in a timely manner.
    (II) Collecting and Destroying Fallen Flowers and Fruits: Collect and destroy the fallen flowers and fruits on the ground every morning, as the flowers and fruits fall off after being infested, and the insects remain inside.
    (III) Clean the Cotton Field and Pull Cotton Stalks Early: Same as for pink bollworm.
    (IV) Spraying 10% DDT powder or 10% DDT sulfur powder: Same as for pink bollworm.
    (V) Spraying 1:200 Lead Arsenate Solution: Same as for pink bollworm.
    VI. Cotton Leaf Roller
    The cotton leaf roller, also known as the leaf borer, is widespread in cotton-growing areas across the country, with Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan being the most severely affected. It has two to six generations a year, depending on climate variations in different regions, with July to September being its peak damaging period. The larvae spin silk to roll the leaves and hide inside, feeding on the cotton leaves. In severe cases, they can eat all the cotton leaves on the entire plant and directly damage the flower buds. American cotton has broad leaves and is therefore particularly susceptible. The control methods are as follows:
    (I) Clean the Field and Remove Weeds: The large leaf rollers mostly overwinter in withered leaves, withered fruits, and weeds, so the work of disposing of withered leaves, withered fruits, and weeds is very important.
    (II) Slap the Insects: Use two wooden boards to slap the rolled leaves and crush the insects inside.
    (III) Spraying Lead Arsenate Solution: Spraying lead arsenate solution diluted 100 to 300 times with a sprayer from July to September is quite effective in killing the insects.
    (IV) Spraying 10% DDT Powder: Spraying 10% DDT powder with a powder duster from July to September is also very effective. In addition, spraying 666 powder is also very good.
    VII. Plant Bugs
    Plant bugs are small yellow-green insects that are usually not noticed. Cotton farmers all feel the seriousness of the "broken leaf madness" disease and have no solution. In fact, it is the result of plant bug damage. It has several generations within a year, which has not yet been clarified. It is only known that it probably overwinters as an adult and lays eggs on the cotton buds, in the folds of the flowers, or within the tissues of the flowers or leaves. Both larvae and adults damage the cotton, using their needle-like mouthparts to pierce the tender stems and leaves of the cotton plants, absorbing sap and excreting toxins. As a result, the cotton plants develop abnormal growth, the leaves are riddled with numerous holes, the branches and leaves become abnormally lush, and many flower buds and young bolls are damaged and fall off. Therefore, the cotton plants have very few bolls. The period of severe damage is from July to August. During this period, spraying 5% DDT powder or 5% DDT sulfur powder once a month with a powder duster can control them. Apply one to three catties of insecticide per mu.
    The above-mentioned cotton pests are relatively serious. Others, such as the cotton looper, cotton bollworm, and cotton flea beetle, are also quite important. However, their outbreak periods are roughly the same as those of the pink bollworm, etc. As long as 10% DDT powder or 10% DDT sulfur powder is sprayed once a month from July to September, they can be controlled along with them.

    四、红铃虫
    红蛉虫又叫红虫或棉花蛆，是棉株开花时期最严重的害虫，分布很广而以华中南棉区受害特烈。它每年发生二至五代，随各地气候的变化不同，以生长成熟的幼虫在棉籽或棉铃内过冬，翌年春末夏初变蛹化蛾产卵。幼虫孵化后，即钻入花蕾或棉铃内蛀食，被害的花蕾，不久即脱落。有的已结成小铃，因被害较重，不久亦脱落。其蛀入棉铃内的红铃虫，就贯穿各棉瓣内，食害种子，棉铃遂不能正常开放，即使有一、二瓣没有被害，棉花的品质也变坏。被害的棉籽既不能留作种籽，也不好榨油，如果夏秋多雨，病菌很容易由被害部分侵入，以致大部棉铃腐烂，更造成严重的损失。其为害期以七至九月为烈。兹将防治方法简述如下：
    （一）预防办法：下面所讲的几种预防办法，需要大家来做，才有效果。（１）清洁田面：一部分红铃虫是藏在棉田里落果枯叶中过冬的，所以在棉花收获以后，要把落果枯叶，收集起来，用火烧毁。（２）早拔早烧棉秸：棉株上残留的青铃和僵瓣，藏着很多的红铃虫，要在霜降之前，把棉秸拔去，必须在清明之前烧完。（３）处理籽棉：棉花收获后，要常常曝晒，棉籽里躲藏的虫子，受热后就爬出来，放鸡啄食，数次以后，绝大部分的虫子，都可除去。
    （二）喷撒百分之十的ＤＤＴ粉或百分之十ＤＤＴ硫黄粉：在七至九月红铃虫发生期间，每隔二十天至三十天，选择天晴无风的早晨或傍晚，用撒粉器喷撒百分之十ＤＤＴ粉或百分十ＤＤＴ硫黄粉一次，对除治红铃虫很有效果，每亩撒药一至三斤。
    （三）喷布砒酸铅液：在七至九月每月用喷雾器喷布砒酸铅液一次，配合量是砒酸铅一斤加水二百斤，每亩用量二百至三百斤。
    （四）摘拾落花落果：在七月间棉株开花正盛期内，每日清晨采摘棉株上被害的花蕾和把落在地面的花果拾起烧毁，以后每隔十天检拾一次，至九月中旬为止，可以杀死很多的红铃虫。
    五、金钢钻
    金钢钻又叫花虫或钻心虫，沿海各省及四川棉区为害最重，长江中游及西南棉区次之，华北较轻。它为害棉株部分，计有嫩头，嫩茎，嫩叶，花蕾，嫩铃等。在江浙一带年生四代，第一代幼虫在六月下旬出现，第二代在七月中旬，第三代在八月下旬，第四代在九月下旬。初孵化的幼虫，为害棉株嫩头、嫩叶，继蛀入茎内食害，或由花蕾的基部，钻一圆孔而入，伤害其重要部分，稍长大的幼虫，多害花和铃果，在苞叶处，钻孔入铃为害，等到内容吃尽，再爬出另害其他花蕾或嫩铃，被害的蕾和铃，不久即脱落。为害期以七月中旬至九月中旬为最烈。其防治方法，有下列数种：
    （一）摘棉株嫩头：金钢钻的成虫，喜在棉株的嫩头上产卵，可利用这种习性，于其发生期间，摘下嫩头，对于突出的棉头或在住室附近的棉田，更要特别注意。摘下的嫩头，应该及时烧毁或深埋土中。
    （二）拾毁落花落果：每日清晨拾毁地面的落花落果，因为花果被害后即脱落，虫子仍留在内也。
    （三）清洁棉田和早拔棉秸：与红铃虫同。
    （四）喷撒百分之十ＤＤＴ粉或百分之十ＤＤＴ硫黄粉：与红铃虫同。
    （五）喷布一比二百砒酸铅液：与红铃虫同。
    六、棉大卷叶虫
    棉大卷叶虫又叫叶苞虫，普遍全国棉区，而以江苏、浙江、湖北、湖南、四川等棉区受害最重。它一年发生二代至六代，随各地的气候变化而不同，七月至九月则为其为害盛期。幼虫吐丝卷叶，身藏其中，食害棉叶，为害烈时，可把全株棉叶食尽，并直接食害花苞，美棉叶片阔大，故受害特重。它的防治方法，有下列几种：
    （一）清洁田面及铲除杂草：大卷叶虫多潜伏在枯叶枯果和杂草中越冬，故处理枯叶枯果和杂草的工作很为重要。
    （二）拍虫：用两块木板合拍卷叶，压杀其中虫子。
    （三）喷布砒酸铅液：在七月至九月用喷雾器喷布砒酸铅一百至三百倍液，杀虫效力颇好。
    （四）喷布百分之十ＤＤＴ粉剂：在七至九月用撒粉器喷撒百分之十ＤＤＴ粉剂，此外喷撒六六六粉剂亦甚佳。
    七、盲椿象
    盲椿象是黄绿色小虫子，平常不大为人所注意，我们种棉花的农民，都感觉到破叶疯病的严重，没有办法，其实就是盲椿象为害的结果。它一年内发生几代，直到现在还没有搞清楚，只晓得它大概是以成虫越冬，翌年产卵在棉花苞上，花的摺缝间，花或叶的组织内。幼虫和成虫都为害棉花，用它的针状嘴巴刺进棉株的嫩茎叶里，吸收汁液，并吐出毒素，因此棉株即发生不正常的生长，叶片破袭成多数穿孔，枝叶成不正常的繁茂，花蕾和嫩铃亦多被害而脱落，因此被害棉株上的棉铃极为稀少。为害严重的时期是七月至八月。在此期中每月用撒粉器喷撒百分之五ＤＤＴ粉或百分之五ＤＤＴ硫黄粉一次，就可防治，每亩施药量一至三斤。
    以上所说的几种棉花害虫是比较严重的，其他如棉尺蠖（棉步曲）、棉铃虫、棉叶跳虫等，也都有相当的重要性，不过它们的发生时期，都和红铃虫等差不多相同，只要在七至九月每月喷布百分之十ＤＤＴ粉或百分之十ＤＤＴ硫黄粉一次，就可连带的把它们防治了。
