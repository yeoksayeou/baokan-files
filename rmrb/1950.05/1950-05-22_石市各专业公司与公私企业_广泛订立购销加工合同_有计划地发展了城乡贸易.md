　　Shijiazhuang Professional Companies and Public and Private Enterprises
    Widely Sign Purchase and Sale Processing Contracts to Develop Urban-Rural Trade in a Planned Way
    [Report from this newspaper in Hebei] In order to support industry and commerce beneficial to the national economy and people's livelihood and to develop urban-rural trade, the state-owned professional companies in Shijiazhuang have widely signed agency sales, procurement, and processing contracts with cooperatives, public enterprises, and private manufacturers in various counties, according to their different natures and with different content. From the establishment of various professional companies in September of last year to mid-April of this year, a total of more than 200 contracts of various types have been established: including 81 agency sales contracts, 78 procurement contracts, and 130 processing contracts. Among the procurement contracts, cooperatives account for 93.3 percent; in agency sales contracts, cooperatives account for 67.8 percent; and in processing contracts, private manufacturers account for 75.6 percent. According to their different natures, each type of contract is divided into two categories. Among the procurement contracts, one type is long-term agency purchase, in which the company first pays a loan, the purchase price is determined by the company, and the company is informed of the purchased goods every day, with a 2% commission charged, and all other transportation expenses are borne by the company. The land products and oil companies have signed the most contracts of this form. The other type is to stipulate in advance to purchase a certain quantity of goods within a certain period of time, and the receiving party delivers the goods to the company, which pays according to the market price at the time of delivery. This method is mostly applicable to private merchants. The egg product company signed 48 contracts with various counties in the Shijiazhuang Special District and Hengshui and other counties, including two such contracts. From January to March, the company received a total of more than 43.4 million fresh eggs, of which 82.4 percent were purchased through cooperatives. From January to the end of April, the oil company purchased more than 285,000 jin of peanuts, more than 42,000 jin of peanut kernels, and more than 44,000 jin of cotton seeds from the Xingtai Special District Society, Gaocheng Zhaozhuang, and Nanmeng Society alone, accounting for 50 percent of the company's business.
    Agency sales contracts are also divided into two types. One type is long-term agency sales, where the agent only takes a commission of 1% to 4% of the sales price. Salt and coal industries mostly adopt this method. The other type is a periodic credit sales contract, where the unsold goods within the specified time are returned to the credit sales agent. The price advantage of this method is higher than the commission for long-term agency sales. For example, the salt company's long-term agency sales commission is 2% of the salt price, while the periodic credit sales commission is 4%. Now, many have transitioned from periodic credit sales to agency sales relationships. In early March, the department store and retail company also changed from credit sales to long-term agency sales. According to statistics from Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Dingxian, and Gaocheng, since its establishment, the coal company has signed 27 agency sales and credit sales contracts with retail companies, cooperatives, water conservancy promotion societies, and coal merchants. Most of them adopt the method of the company first sending coal to the coal yards of various societies along the line, which are stored by the societies on behalf of the company, and then signing credit sales or cash sales agreements. The company does not engage in retail business. Cooperatives have become lower-level coal sales agencies. In this way, under the principle of benefiting both parties, the local coal shortage problem has been solved, and the task of currency withdrawal has been completed. In March alone, coal sales reached 92,888 tons, of which 39,672 tons were sold by cooperatives, accounting for a little more than 42.6 percent.
    There are two types of processing contracts. One type is where the company supplies raw materials, and after the processing and production by Party B, a certain quantity of products is delivered, and the company pays wages. For example, the egg product company supplies eggs to the Yumin Egg Factory of the municipal enterprise company, and the cotton yarn company supplies cotton yarn to the weaving factory. Both purchase a certain quantity of products and then pay wages. The other type is in the form of exchange, where the company supplies raw materials, and the factory delivers a certain product, and wages are not paid separately. The grain and oil companies use this method more often. The contract period is generally stipulated for one month to half a year according to different production units. The cotton yarn company supports cotton weaving factories and public institutions in production, and has signed contracts with a total of 100 households of cooperatives and private factories (private factories account for 78 households), producing 10,691 bolts of white cloth per month. From its establishment last year to April of this year, the grain company has signed 10 processing contracts with public and private manufacturers (2 public and 8 private), and recovered flour equivalent to 7,594,533 jin of wheat, 6,212,474 jin of millet, 6,172,729 jin of corn, and 19,943 jin of soybeans. The oil company signed 4 processing contracts, and by the end of April, recovered 67,168 jin of peanut oil and 102,535 jin of cottonseed oil.
    Due to the signing of various contracts, the blindness in urban-rural material exchange has been gradually overcome, producers have been organized and assisted, and the waste of manpower and materials has been reduced. However, due to the lack of experience and planning in signing contracts, many problems have also occurred. First of all, there is insufficient attention to contract policies and adherence to credit. Therefore, some are only verbal agreements, which are often changed temporarily, and some, although contracts are signed, are not implemented according to the contract, reflecting the ideology of departmentalism. The former is afraid of trouble, thinking that they are all public and there will be no problems, but disputes arise in the implementation. For example, the cooperative warehouse introduced the Jinan Supply and Marketing Cooperative to buy 200,000 jin of red sorghum from the grain company. The cooperative warehouse believed that this was an agency sale and the company should pay a commission, but the company did not think so. Although a compromise was reached, both parties were unhappy. The salt company and the cooperative warehouse also had a similar incident where the original contract expired and no formal contract was continued, so an oral agreement was used, which resulted in the warehouse violating the contract and causing the company to suffer a lot of losses. Therefore, to carry out business well and extensively through contracts, we should proceed from the perspective of supporting production and connecting urban-rural trade, overcome the one-sided departmental thinking, and proceed under the principle of benefiting both parties. Once a contract is established, credit must be ensured, and the views of lacking confidence in the promotion of contracts and mutually utilizing each other must be resolutely overcome.

　　石市各专业公司与公私企业
    广泛订立购销加工合同 
    有计划地发展了城乡贸易
    【本报河北讯】石家庄市各国营专业公司为了扶植有利于国计民生的工商业，并开展城乡贸易，广泛与各县合作社、公营企业、私营厂商，按照不同性质，分别订立不同内容的代销、收购、加工合同。自去年九月各专业公司成立到今年四月中旬，共建立各种合同二百余件：其中代销合同八十一件，收购合同七十八件，加工合同一百三十件。在收购合同中合作社占百分之九十三点三，代销合同合作社占百分之六十七点八，加工合同私营厂商占百分之七十五点六。各种合同根据不同性质每类均分为二种，收购合同中，一种是长期代购，由公司先付贷款，收购价格由公司规定，每天将收购物品报告公司，按百分之二抽手续费，其他运费开支统由公司责负。订立这种形式合同的是土产、油脂公司为最多。另一种是先规定在一定时间收购一定数量的货物，由收方将货物送交公司，按交货时市价付款，这种方式多适用于私商。蛋品公司与石家庄专区各县及衡水等县订立合同四十八件，其中即有此种合同二件。一至三月份该公司共收鲜蛋四千三百四十万余个，通过合作社收购者占百分之八十二点四。油脂公司自一月到四月底仅邢台专区社，藁城赵庄，南孟社就收购花生二十八万五千余斤，花生米四万二千余斤，棉籽四万四千余斤，在该公司业务上占百分之五十。
    代销合同亦分两种，一种是长期代销，代销户只取销货的手续费百分之一至百分之四，盐煤业多采用此种办法。另一种是定期赊销合同，赊销货物在规定时间内卖不出去货归赊销户，像这种办法在价格优待上较长期代销的手续费为高，如盐业公司订长期代销的手续费为盐价百分之二，定期赊销则为百分之四。现在由定期赊销关系转为代销者甚多。百货与零售公司在三月初亦由赊销转为长期代销。据石家庄、保定、定县、藁城四处统计，煤业公司自成立到现在已与零售公司、合作社、水利推进社、煤商订立代销、赊销合同二十七件，其中多采用公司先把煤送到沿线各社煤厂，由社代存，再订赊销或现销协议，公司不作零售业务。合作社成了下层销煤机构。这样，在两利原则下，解决了当地缺煤问题，并完成了货币回笼任务。仅三月份销煤即达九二、八八八吨，其中依靠合作社售出者为三九、六七二吨，占百分之四十二点六强。
    加工合同，一种是由公司供给原料，经乙方加工生产后，交一定数量的产品，由公司付给工资。如蛋品公司供给市企业公司裕民蛋厂鸡蛋，花纱布公司供给织布厂棉纱，都是收购一定数量的产品再付工资。另一种是用交换形式，由公司供给原料，厂方交一定产品，工资不另付。粮食、油脂公司使用这个办法较多。合同期限一般是按照不同的生产单位规定出一个月至半年。花纱布公司扶植棉织工厂与公营机关生产、合作社、私营工厂共订合同一百户（私营占七十八户）每月产白布一万零六百九十一匹。粮食公司自去年成立到今年四月先后与公私营厂商订加工合同十件（公二私八），收回面粉折小麦七、五九四、五三三斤，谷子六、二一二、四七四斤，玉米六、一七二、七二九斤，元豆一九、九四三斤。油脂公司订立加工合同四件，到四月底收回花生油六七、一六八斤，棉籽油一○二、五三五斤。
    由于各种合同的订立，逐渐克服了城乡物资交流中的盲目性，组织与扶助了生产者，减少了人力与物力的浪费。但是，由于在订立合同中缺乏经验和计划性，也曾发生了不少问题，首先是重视合同政策及遵守信用不够，因此有的仅只口头协议，临时常变更，有的虽定合同，但不按合同执行，反映出本位主义的思想。前者为的是怕麻烦，认为都是公家，不至于有什么问题，但在执行中就发生了争执。如合作货栈介绍济南供销社买粮食公司红粮二十万斤，合作货栈认为这算代销，公司应出手续费，而公司认为不算，结果虽得到折衷解决，但双方都不痛快。盐业公司与合作货栈亦因原定合同期满未继续订立正式合同，就用口头协议的方式，致发生货栈违背了合同规定而使公司受到不少损失的事情。因此，要很好的广泛的通过合同开展业务，应从扶植生产、沟通城乡贸易的观点出发，克服片面的本位思想，在两利的原则下进行。合同一经成立必须确保信用，坚决克服对合同推动无信心与互相利用的观点。
