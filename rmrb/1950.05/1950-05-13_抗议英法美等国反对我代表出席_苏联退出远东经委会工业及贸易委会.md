　　Protesting Opposition from Britain, France, the United States, and Other Countries to the Attendance of Our Representatives
　　Soviet Union Withdraws from the Industry and Trade Committee of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East
Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, May 11th: The Industry and Trade Committee of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East held its second meeting on May 9th. The Soviet representative proposed that the Kuomintang representatives should be expelled from the committee and that the representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China should be recognized as the legitimate representatives of China.
　　Apart from the Soviet representative, the representatives of Burma and India also voted in favor of discussing the Soviet motion. The Indonesian representative abstained, and the Pakistani representative left the meeting. The representatives of other countries, including Britain, France, the United States, and the Netherlands, voted against discussing the Soviet proposal. Because the majority of the committee refused to discuss the motion of the Soviet representative, the Soviet representative withdrew from the meeting of the committee.

　　苏联退出远东经委会工业及贸易委会
    【新华社十二日讯】塔斯社曼谷十一日电：亚洲与远东经济委员会的工业及贸易委员会于五月九日举行第二次会议。苏联代表提议应将国民党代表逐出该委员会，并应认为中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表是中国合法的代表。
    除苏联代表以外，缅甸与印度的代表也投票赞成讨论苏联的动议。印尼代表弃权，巴基斯坦代表离开会场。其他国家的代表，包括英国、法国、美国与荷兰在内，均投票反对讨论苏联的建议。因为该委员会的多数派拒绝讨论苏联代表的动议，苏联代表遂退出该委员会的会议。
