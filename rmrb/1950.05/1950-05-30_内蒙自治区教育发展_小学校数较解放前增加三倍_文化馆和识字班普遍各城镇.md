Xinhua News Agency, 28th. The educational undertaking in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has rapidly recovered and greatly developed in the three years since the establishment of the autonomous government, and is now continuing to be consolidated and improved.

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region includes eleven leagues and seventy-nine banners of the Mongolian nationality originally within the provinces of Heilongjiang, Liaoxi, Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Ningxia, covering an area of approximately 1.5 million square li and a population of approximately 12 million. According to statistics from early spring this year, there are already 3,676 primary schools with 182,977 students and 5,232 teachers; compared to the most developed period of education before liberation, the number of schools has increased more than threefold, the number of students has increased more than one and a half times, and the number of teachers has increased by one time. The number of children enrolled accounts for more than half of the school-age children. There are currently seven middle schools with 18,778 students and 107 teachers; the number of schools and students has decreased slightly compared to before liberation, because local construction needs cadres, and one-half of the middle school teachers have been transferred to participate in revolutionary work.

In terms of social education, most towns with populations of 20,000 to 30,000 have cultural centers and literacy classes. In the seven banners of the Jirem League, there are 1,269 literacy classes with 12,910 participants; 22 amateur theater troupes with 95 actors; and 490 blackboards. In rural areas, men and women, young and old, enthusiastically participate in winter studies. State-owned factories all have worker supplementary schools, with two to three hours of study each day, generally focusing on cultural courses.

Last year, the education administrative department published 32 types of Mongolian primary school textbooks, totaling 388,621 copies; and five types of Mongolian social education textbooks on literacy, production, winter studies, the masses, and the lunar calendar, totaling 41,069 copies. The Inner Mongolia Daily published 60 types of Mongolian popular mass reading materials, totaling 99,714 copies. The Xinhua Bookstore Inner Mongolia Branch also distributed a large number of Chinese mass reading materials; in Ulanhot City alone, 5,269 copies of Chinese literacy and cultural textbooks were sold.

　　内蒙自治区教育发展
    小学校数较解放前增加三倍  文化馆和识字班普遍各城镇
    【新华社二十八日讯】内蒙自治区的教育事业，在自治政府成立后三年中很快地得到了恢复和很大的发展，现正继续整顿与提高。
    内蒙自治区包括原在黑龙江、辽西、热河、察哈尔、绥远、宁夏诸省内之蒙古民族十一个盟、七十九个旗，面积约一百五十万平方里，人口约一千二百万左右。据今年春初统计，已有小学三千六百七十六所，学生一十八万二千九百七十七名，教员五千二百三十二名；比解放前教育最发达时期学校增加了三倍多，学生增加了一倍半以上，教员增加了一倍。入学儿童占学龄儿童一半以上。中学现有七所，学生一万八千七百七十八名，教员一百零七名；学校、学生比解放前均略有减少，原因是地方建设需要干部，中学教员抽调了二分之一参加了革命工作。
    社会教育方面，在二、三万人口的城镇，大都有了文化馆和识字班。在哲里木盟七个旗有识字班一千二百六十九处，参加人数一万二千九百一十名；业余剧团二十二处，演员九十五名；黑板报四百九十处。各地农村男女老幼都热烈地参加冬学。公营工厂都有了工人补习学校，每天有二、三小时的学习，一般都以文化课为主。
    去年教育行政部门出版了蒙文小学课本三十二种，三十八万八千六百二十一册；蒙文社会教育课本识字、生产、冬学、群众、农历五种，共四万一千零六十九册。内蒙古日报社出版蒙文通俗群众读物六十种，九万九千七百一十四册。新华书店内蒙分店也发行大批汉文群众读物，在乌兰浩特市一地出售的汉文识字文化课本就有五千二百六十九册。
