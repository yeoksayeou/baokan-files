　　Seize the Time to Plant Elm Trees
    These days, elm seeds are ripening. I hope that forestry cadres in various localities, or comrades working in the countryside, should mobilize the masses, using the spare time of women and children, to quickly collect elm seeds. In the open spaces in front of and behind houses, on the sides of dikes, embankments, and roads, loosen the soil, sow the seeds, then cover them with a thin layer of fine soil and press firmly with a shovel. They will sprout in about ten days and grow into seedlings about a foot tall in a year. Next spring, transplant them to open spaces. This type of tree can grow well in low-lying, damp flatlands, or in cohesive sandy soil, as long as the soil layer is deep. In ten to twenty years, they can grow to a height of thirty to fifty feet. During the growing period, pruned branches can be used as fuel, elm seeds can be steamed and eaten, and the wood is strong and durable, suitable for making furniture, vehicles, and boat bottoms. It is also excellent for providing shade, protecting embankments, and preserving water and moisture.

　　抓紧时宜栽种榆树
    这几天，榆树种子都成熟了。我希望各地的林业干部，或在乡村里工作的同志，应该号召群众，利用妇女儿童的空闲时候，赶快扫集榆钱，在屋前屋后、堤边、圩埂、道旁的空地，把土刨松，播下种子，然后盖上一层薄薄的细土，用锹拍紧。大约十来天就可发芽，一年就长成尺来高的苗子，明年春天，再把它分栽空地。这种树在低湿的平地，或者带粘性砂土，只要土层深厚，都可良好地生长，一二十年就能长到三五丈高，生长期间，修下枝条可以作燃料，榆钱可以蒸吃，木材性质坚韧，作家具、车辆、船底都合用，作为遮荫，保堤保存水湿也是很好的。
