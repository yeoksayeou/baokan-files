　　Thirty-Three Production Cooperatives Established Citywide
    Over a Thousand Handicraft Workers Participate in Production
    [This newspaper dispatch] Our reporter Jin Yu reports: Under the assistance of the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, banks, and state trading organs, the majority of Beijing's handicraft workers have been organized and are now able to be employed in production. Since July of last year, the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative has been organizing independent laborers and unemployed workers to establish production cooperatives. To date, thirty-three cooperatives have been organized, with a total of one thousand three hundred and eighty-four handicraft workers participating in production.
    The state has provided various forms of assistance to these production cooperatives. From July of last year to March of this year, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased over 20,000 bolts of homespun cloth, a large number of socks, and towels from the production cooperatives. It also subcontracted 6000 pairs of shoes to shoe-making cooperatives and placed orders with sewing cooperatives for large quantities of shirts and shorts. The grass rope cooperative's products are guaranteed sales through a contract signed by the general cooperative and the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant. State banks have provided total loans of over ten billion yuan to them, with twenty-one of the thirty-three cooperatives receiving bank loan support. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company entrusted cotton weaving cooperatives with processing, and the Fur Company entrusted carpet cooperatives with processing dyed yarn. The department store promotes the sale of towel cooperative products. This has solved the problems of raw materials and sales.
    These workers have overcome many difficulties in the establishment and operation of the cooperatives, demonstrating the benefits of organization. The Taipusi Street Shoe Industry Cooperative was initially established by eight unemployed workers, each contributing ten jin of millet. During the most difficult time last winter, the workers slept on the ground, ate corn buns without pickles, and the members sold their clothes to resolutely prevent the cooperative from falling apart. Members of the No. 11 District Towel Cooperative, in order to maintain operations, agreed to ride pedicabs when there was no work, so as not to deplete the capital. Workers who join the production cooperatives generally have very good production enthusiasm. The Shoe United Cooperative held a production competition. Zhao Defu, a model member of the cooperative, went out to learn the technique of making cloth shoes and then taught it to everyone.
    With the development of production cooperative businesses, the lives of the members have been initially resolved. Currently, members of the sewing, shoe-making, construction, towel, and electrical cooperatives can earn an average of two hundred jin of millet per month per person. In addition to resolving the livelihood of its members, some production cooperatives have accumulated capital. The No. 11 District Towel Cooperative added five machines in more than half a year. After purchasing and expending costs, the cooperative still had a net surplus of twenty-one bundles of yarn. Over a hundred members of the Construction Cooperative who were working in Cangkunan Hutong also hired eight volunteer teachers to provide two hours of classes every evening after work. The members said happily, "If it weren't for organizing the production cooperative, we would disband after finishing the work, how could we still have the opportunity to study!"
    These production cooperatives still have some problems, such as low technical level and lack of management skills. Some members do not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of organizing themselves for production. Therefore, strengthening member education has become an important issue in future production cooperative work. In conjunction with improving members' understanding of the production cooperatives, fully promoting the democratic style of members managing the production cooperatives themselves, and ensuring product quality, and upholding contracts and maintaining credit in operations, the production organizations of handicraft workers themselves—the production cooperatives—can be further consolidated and developed.

### 全市已成立三十三个生产合作社  千余手工业者参加生产

　　全市已成立三十三个生产合作社
    千余手工业者参加生产
    【本报讯】记者近宇报道：北京市手工业工人在市供销总社、银行及国家贸易机关的扶助下，大部组织起来，得以就业生产。京市供销合作总社自去年七月开始，组织独立劳动者及失业工人建立生产合作社以来，迄今已组织了三十三个，参加生产的手工业工人共一千三百八十四人。
    国家对这些生产社曾给了多种帮助。自去年七月到今年三月，供销总社曾向生产合作社收购了二万多匹土布，大量的袜子和毛巾。还给制鞋合作社代揽了六双只鞋子，向缝纫社定做了大批的衬衣和短裤等。草绳合作社所产的草绳，经由总社与石景山钢铁厂订定合同，保证了销路。国家银行对他们贷款总额有十余亿元，三十三社中有二十一个社受到银行贷款的扶植。花纱布公司委托棉织社加工，皮毛公司委托地毯社加工染线，毛巾社的产品由百货公司为其推销。这样就解决了原料和销路问题。
    这些工人在建社和经营中曾经克服了许多困难。表现组织起来的好处。太仆寺街鞋业合作社建社初期，是由八个失业工人每人出小米十斤搞起来的。在去年冬天最困难的时候，工人在地上睡觉，吃窝窝头没有咸菜，社员卖掉衣服，坚决维持不散摊。十一区毛巾社的社员为了坚持业务，大家约定没有活就蹬三轮，决不能吃掉本钱。加入生产社的工人，一般生产情绪都很好。鞋联社曾举行生产竞赛。该社模范社员赵德福到外边学习做洒鞋技术，回来再教给大家。
    社员的生活随着生产社业务的开展，已经初步解决。目前缝纫、制鞋、建筑、毛巾、电气等社的社员平均每月每人能拿到二百斤小米。有的生产社除了解决社员生活以外，并积累了资金。十一区毛巾社在半年多时间增添了五张机子，除了购置、开支还净余了二十一捆纱。建筑合作社在仓南胡同做工的一百多个社员，还聘请了八个义务教员，在每晚工余上课两小时。社员们高兴的说：“要不是组织生产社，做完工就散伙，那里还能念书！”
    这些生产社目前还存在着一些问题，如技术水平低、不会经营管理等等。有些社员对自己组织起来进行生产的意义还没有足够的认识。因此，加强社员教育就成了今后生产社工作中的重要的问题。配合着社员对生产社认识的提高，充分发扬社员自己管理生产社的民主作风，再保证产品质量，在经营中执行合同维护信用，手工业工人自己的生产组织——生产合作社才能得到进一步的巩固与发展。
