Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 13th (TASS): The newspaper *Pravda* published an editorial commenting on the struggle of people of all countries for peace. *Pravda* first stated: The struggle of the people of all countries for peace and against the instigators of a new war is intensifying day by day. At this stage, the central task of this struggle is to launch a campaign to sign the appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress on the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons and the declaration that the first government to use atomic weapons is a war criminal.

　　*Pravda* pointed out: These demands are in line with the most important and fundamental interests of the people of all countries, the vast majority of the world's population. Workers, peasants, scientists, artists, clergy, people of different political views, different religious beliefs, different nationalities, different occupations, and different ages, young and old, have signed the appeal. In Hungary, more than seven million peace advocates have signed the appeal. In Bulgaria, almost all adults have signed the petition, totaling more than five million. The situation is the same in Romania, with seven million signatures. The situation is the same in Poland and Czechoslovakia. In the German Democratic Republic, the number of signatures has exceeded fifteen million. The signature campaign has also been successful in West Germany. Despite the suppression and terror of the British and American authorities, the appeal has been signed by 100% of the workers and other employees of many factories and workshops, and 90% to 100% of the adults in several towns. In France, the signature campaign is being widely launched.

　　*Pravda* went on to emphasize: The signature campaign has not yet been fully launched, because the task is not to solicit tens of millions of signatures, but to solicit hundreds of millions of signatures, to have every peace advocate sign his name on the appeal, thereby declaring his opposition to war, his demand for the unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons, the establishment of strict international control over the implementation of this ban, and the declaration that the first government to use atomic weapons against any country is a war criminal.

　　*Pravda* also stated: A successful signature campaign will be a stern warning to warmongers, making them feel the great strength of the organized movement for peace and the security of all countries. The need to further intensify the struggle for peace and security has become even more apparent, as warmongers continue their activities.

　　*Pravda* concluded: The answer of peace advocates to the conspiracies of imperialists who are stirring up discord among the peoples of all countries and pursuing a policy of aggression and launching new wars is to resolutely consolidate their ranks and intensify their active struggle to advocate peace and oppose warmongers. Exposing warmongers and defending peace is the cause of the people of the world! Hold high the banner of struggle for peace and the security of all countries!

　　论现阶段的世界和平运动
　　广泛展开的和平签名运动，将是对战争贩子的严厉警告！
    【新华社十四日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十三日讯：真理报发表社论评论各国人民争取和平的斗争。真理报首称：各国人民争取和平反对新战争挑拨者的斗争正一天比一天加紧。在现阶段中，这个斗争的中心任务乃是开展在世界拥护和平大会常设委员会关于无条件禁用原子武器与宣布第一个使用原子武器的政府为战争罪犯的呼吁书上签名的运动。
    真理报指出：这些要求符合各国人民、世界人口绝大多数的最重大和最基本的利益。工人、农民、科学家、艺术家、牧师，不同政治见解，不同宗教信仰、不同国籍、不同职业及不同年龄的人，老老少少都在呼吁书上签了名。在匈牙利，呼吁书上有七百多万和平拥护者签了名。在保加利亚，差不多一切成年人都在请愿书上签了名，总数超过五百万。在罗马尼亚有七百万人签了名。在波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的情形也是一样。在德意志民主共和国，签名人数已超过一千五百万。签名运动在西德也是成功的，尽管英美当局实行压制和恐怖，呼吁书上仍然有许多工厂和作坊的百分之百的工人和其他雇员与若干城镇的百分之九十至百分之百的成年人签了名。在法国，签名运动正在广泛展开。
    真理报进而强调指出：签名运动迄今还没有充分地展开，因为任务并不是要征求数千万人签名，而是要征求数万万人签名，要使每一个和平拥护者都在呼吁书上签上他的名字，从而宣布他反对战争，他要求无条件禁用原子武器、对这个禁令的实行建立严格的国际管制，并宣布第一个对任何国家使用原子武器的政府为战争罪犯。
    真理报又称：成功的征求签名的运动，将是对战争贩子的严厉警告，使他们感到争取和平与各国安全的有组织运动的巨大力量。进一步加紧争取和平与安全的斗争的需要已更为明显，因为战争贩子正继续他们的活动。
    真理报最后称：对于那些正在挑拨各国人民间的不和与奉行侵略和发动新战争政策的帝国主义者的阴谋，和平拥护者的答复乃是坚决巩固他们的队伍与加紧他们的拥护和平、反对战争贩子的积极斗争。揭露战争贩子与保卫和平乃是全世界人民的事业！更高地举起为和平与各国安全而斗争的旗帜吧！
