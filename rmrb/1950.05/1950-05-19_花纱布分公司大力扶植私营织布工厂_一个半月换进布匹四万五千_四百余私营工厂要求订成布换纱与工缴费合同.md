　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The state-owned China Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company's Beijing branch is continuing its efforts to support the production of private weaving factories in Beijing through exchange. Given the current sluggish market for cloth, the company has, since April, exchanged yarn and processing fees for over 45,400 bolts of "23" and "81" cloth in one and a half months, exceeding the total received in February and March by over 6,000 bolts. In February, a total of 420 private factories, including those with over 1,100 power and manual looms, signed contracts with the company requesting cloth-for-yarn and processing fees. This has now increased to 666 factories with over 1,500 looms, which means that this accounts for half of all weaving machines owned by private factories in Beijing. Regarding the exchange method, the Beijing Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company is also paying attention to overcoming certain shortcomings. For example, after the implementation of the Trade Treasury's decision in late March, the company experienced a temporary shortage of cash and at one point used yarn to pay processing fees instead of cash. As a result, the factories had to sell the yarn to cover their daily expenses, but the company's yarn prices were higher than market prices, and they also had to pay business tax on the yarn sales, which caused them some losses. The company acknowledged this problem and, after consulting with higher authorities, resumed paying processing fees in cash from the 25th of last month. In addition, the company is working to simplify the exchange procedures. It has already exchanged preliminary views with manufacturers who have signed contracts to exchange yarn on how to avoid the waste of time and manpower involved in queuing for inspection when exchanging yarn, and a solution will be found soon. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch Company's support for the production of private weaving factories in Beijing is not driven by its own profits. From January to April, the company processed over 71,000 bolts of cloth, but due to market prices being lower than cost, it incurred a loss equivalent to over 650,000 jin of millet. Therefore, some private weaving factories must also overcome their existing reliance and work hard to reduce costs and improve quality in order to open up sales channels.

　　花纱布分公司大力扶植私营织布工厂
　　一个半月换进布匹四万五千
　　四百余私营工厂要求订成布换纱与工缴费合同
    【京市新闻处讯】国营中国花纱布公司北京分公司现正继续尽力以交换方式扶植京市私营织布工厂生产。在目前市场布匹滞销情况下，该公司自四月迄今一个半月中，已以纱与工缴费换进“二三”及“八一”等布达四万五千四百余匹，比二、三两个全月多收达六千余匹。二月间与该公司订立合同，要求以成布换纱与工缴费的私营工厂共有四百二十余户，包括电力与人力机一千一百余台，现已增加到六百六十六户，机子达一千五百余台，也就是说：占目前京市私营工厂所有的织布机的一半。在交换方式上，京市花纱布公司也在注意克服某些缺点，如三月下旬执行贸易金库的决定后，该公司一时现金短缺，曾以纱代发工缴费，不给现款，而工厂日用开支必须卖纱，但公司纱价高于市价，且卖纱还须缴纳行商税，这样，工厂便受到一些损失。该公司正视了这一问题，经请示上级后，已于上月二十五日起恢复以现金发工缴费。此外，该公司正在设法力求简化交换手续，已与订立合同换纱的厂家对如何避免换纱时要排队待验的浪费时间、人力的现象，初步交换了意见，最近即可解决。花纱布分公司扶植京市私营织布工厂生产，并不是从本身利润出发的，自一月至四月，四个月中，该公司共加工布七万一千多匹，由于市价低于成本，亏损小米达六十五万余斤，因此，某些私营织布工厂也必须克服现存的依赖思想，努力减低成本，提高质量，以便打开销路。
