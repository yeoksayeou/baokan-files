　　Teacher Viciously Beats Elementary School Student
   Teacher Luo Shuming of Sanzhong Elementary School Should Be Investigated

To the Editor:
　　On April 27th at noon, we went to the privately-run Sanzhong Elementary School on Shangxie Street outside Xuanwu Gate to negotiate borrowing a classroom. We happened to meet the mother of Zhao Yanling, a third-grade student at the school, who was complaining to Principal Zhu about her son being viciously beaten by a teacher. We saw the beaten Zhao Yanling, who had two bumps the size of dates raised on the front and back of his forehead, three bumps on the right side, and two bumps on the back; a red mark on his right cheek, one behind his right ear, three on his right neck, two on his right arm, two on the back of his right hand, one on his right wrist, and a bruise. There was also a red mark on the little finger of his left hand. Every red mark was swollen.
　　I immediately telegraphed the Cultural and Educational Section of the Eleventh District Public Office, and Comrade Gao from the section came to investigate. Principal Zhu of Sanzhong said that such a thing had never happened in the school before, and this was the first time. The next day, Principal Zhu asked teacher Luo Shuming to go to the home of the beaten student, Zhao Yanling, to apologize to the parents, explaining to the student's parents that it was not intentional, but an accidental injury, and that the elementary school student Zhao Yanling was not diligent in his studies, intending to gloss over the matter.
　　I believe that Principal Zhu's perfunctory attitude towards this matter is wrong. Teachers in New China should not beat students under any circumstances. If a student is beaten, at the very least, strict criticism should be given, and a profound self-examination should be made, and if necessary, legal sanctions should be imposed. I hope the relevant authorities will thoroughly investigate.

　　教员毒打小学生
   三忠小学教员罗书铭应予查究编辑同志：
    四月二十七日正午，我们到宣外上斜街私立三忠完全小学去接洽借用教室，正巧遇上该校三年级小学生赵延龄的妈妈，向该校朱校长诉说她的儿子被教员毒打的情形。我们看了被打的赵延龄，他脑门上前后隆起两个包有枣大小，右方有三个包，后部两个包；右脸上有一条红痕，右耳后一条，右脖项三条，右臂二条，右手背二条，右手腕上一条，并有一块伤痕发青，在左手小指部也有一条红痕。每条红痕都肿起来。
    我当时即电告十一区区公所文教科，该科高同志亲来调查。三忠朱校长说该校从没有过这种事情，这只是第一次。第二天朱校长让教员罗书铭到被打学生赵延龄家去给家长道歉，向学生家长解释说：不是存心打的，是误伤，并说小学生赵延龄学功课不用心云云，打算马虎了事。
    我认为朱校长对这件事的马虎态度，是不对的。新中国的教员无论如何不可以打学生。打了学生，至少要给以严格的批评，并要作深刻的自我检讨，必要时还得受法律制裁。希望有关当局彻底查究。
