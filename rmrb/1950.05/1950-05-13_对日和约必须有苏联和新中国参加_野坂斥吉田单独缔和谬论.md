Xinhua News Agency, May 12th: According to a United Press report from Tokyo on May 10th: The Japanese Communist Party's organ, "Akahata" (Red Flag), published an article by Nosaka Sanzō, a member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, criticizing Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru's statement that "Japan is currently virtually in a state of separate peace with the United States." Nosaka pointed out that this proves Yoshida is an extremely vile traitor who is trying to turn Japan into a slave of the United States. Nosaka emphasized that any separate peace treaty without the participation of the Soviet Union and New China is not a true peace treaty and will hinder Japan's recovery.

According to an Associated Press report from Tokyo: Yoshida admitted at the opening of the National Governors' Conference on the 8th that Japan had concluded many "de facto peace treaties" with the United States and other countries in the US-UK bloc. Yoshida also bluntly pointed out that the so-called "de facto peace treaties" differ from separate peace treaties only in form. He said that the only remaining task is to expand the "de facto peace treaties" into legal peace treaties. Yoshida's remarks reveal that his so-called "de facto peace treaties" are precisely the various measures taken by the United States to restore Japan's international status before the signing of a peace treaty, in order to realize its plan of "peace without declaring it" with Japan. The Associated Press supplemented Yoshida's remarks, saying: Yoshida's words may have oversimplified the extent to which the United States has achieved its "peace without declaring it" plan. "In fact, Japan has already gained a considerable amount of international status. It is a member of several international organizations, and its representatives have attended other international conferences. Trade offices and informal consulates have been reopened in several places."

　　对日和约必须有苏联和新中国参加
　　野坂斥吉田单独缔和谬论
    【新华社十二日讯】据合众社东京十日讯：日本共产党机关报赤旗报发表日共中央政治局委员野坂参三的文章，斥责日首相吉田茂所谓“目前日本实际上是与美国处在单独和约的情形之下”的谈话。野坂指出：这件事证明吉田是一个坏到极点的卖国贼，他企图将日本变为美国的奴隶。野坂强调说明：任何没有苏联和新中国参加的单独和约，都不是真正的和约，并将阻挠日本的复兴。
    另据美联社东京消息：吉田于八日在全国都道府县知事会议开幕时承认：日本已与美国和美英集团其他国家缔结了许多“实际的和约”。吉田又毫不隐讳地指出：所谓“实际的和约”与单独的和约仅只是形式上的不同。他说：唯一剩下未做的任务，就是把“实际的和约”扩充为法律上的和约。吉田的谈话透露他所谓的“实际的和约”，正是美国为实现其对日“不宣而和”的计划所采取的在和约签订前恢复日本国际地位的各项措施。美联社补充吉田的谈话称：吉田的话可能过于简化了美国从事“不宣而和”的计划所达到的程度。“实际上，日本已经得到相当多的国际地位。它是若干国际机构的会员，它的代表出席了另一些国际会议。贸易办事处和非正式的领事馆。已在若干地方重新开设。”
