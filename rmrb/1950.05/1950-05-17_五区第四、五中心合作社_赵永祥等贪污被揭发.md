Fifth District Fourth and Fifth Central Cooperative:
Zhao Yongxiang and Others Exposed for Embezzlement

[Reported by this newspaper] Recently, successive cases of collective embezzlement have been discovered in the Fourth and Fifth Central Cooperatives of the Fifth District. After investigation and research, it has now been decided to dismiss and hand over to the court for legal action the main culprits of embezzlement: Zhao Yongxiang (Director of the Fifth Cooperative), Zhang Haiquan (Accountant of the Fifth Cooperative), Gao Qilong (Weigher of the Fifth Cooperative), and Han Deshui (Administrator, originally in the Fourth Cooperative, later transferred to the Fifth Cooperative). Mei Xirong and Na Zhenming (Administrators of the Fifth Cooperative) were accomplices in embezzlement, and as some aspects of their case have not been clarified, they are dismissed and ordered to return home to await further handling. Zhao Guanghua (Director of the Fourth Cooperative) and Yang Guoxi (formerly Accountant of the Fourth Cooperative, later transferred to work in the Third Cooperative) failed to adhere to their posts and protected and participated in embezzlement cases. They are given the disciplinary action of dismissal and self-reflection. Huang Huixian (Cadre and Merit Evaluation Committee Member of the Fourth Cooperative) followed along in embezzlement and receives a demerit and is disqualified from being a Merit Evaluation Committee Member. Wang Changlin, an administrator of the Fifth Cooperative, did not collude in wrongdoing and reported the situation to higher authorities, and was commended at the meeting. The Fifth Central Cooperative had chaotic systems and unclear economic procedures. According to existing statistics, it has a total grain loss of 1,844 catties, in addition to 1,025 catties of grain lent out without authorization, and a loss of over a hundred catties of flour. The result of checking the general ledger against the detailed accounts showed a difference of over 600,000 yuan. Zhao Yongxiang, the director of the cooperative, borrowed 537 catties of grain in advance without approval, borrowed 140,000 yuan of public funds, shielded the cooperative's cadres' embezzlement, and did not report to higher authorities. Accountant Zhang Haiquan masterminded the embezzlement, independently deferred payment for grain, used public funds, and used the cooperative's cigarettes, flour sacks, etc., to win over the tricycle worker representatives and cooperative cadres among the cooperative members. Gao Qilong, who was in charge of weighing at the cooperative, used threats against dissenters, leading to a culture of deferred payment within the cooperative. When the work team checked the warehouse in early April, the cooperative cadres resorted to various fraudulent practices, spreading a layer of corn flour on sacks filled with sand to pretend to be 220 catties of corn flour to make up the numbers.

Zhao Guanghua, director of the Fourth Cooperative, was not responsible in his work, shielded and participated in the cadres' embezzlement, and did not report to higher authorities. When Han Deshui worked in the Fourth Cooperative, he handled the processing of wheat and buckwheat, embezzling 80 catties of ground flour (30 catties were given to Accountant Yang Guoxi), 60 catties of buckwheat flour (10 catties were given to Accountant Yang, and 20 catties were given to Huang Huixian, a female cadre of the cooperative), and 100 catties of bean curd sheets (converted to 15,000 yuan, which was divided among all the cooperative's cadres). He also mixed Camel brand flour into Temple of Heaven brand flour for sale, earning more than ten catties of flour and several thousand yuan in cash, which was decided by the cooperative director to be used for a meal for all the cadres. Han Deshui also borrowed public funds and sold sweet potatoes on behalf of others, weighing them heavily when buying and lightly when selling, on credit to merchants. To date, the price of more than 600 catties of sweet potatoes has not been returned. Yang Guoxi, the accountant of the cooperative, colluded with Han Deshui in embezzlement. Huang Huixian, as a member of the Merit Evaluation Committee, did not report to higher authorities. It was not until Yang Guoxi transferred to work in the Third Cooperative and was completing the handover that a deficit of more than 400,000 yuan was discovered in the accounts. At that time, Yang Guoxi and Director Zhao Guanghua privately挪用抵补挪用抵补 (attempted to use)杂货款项 (miscellaneous goods funds) (for) 挪用抵补 (misappropriation compensation), attempting to deceive higher authorities. The truth was only exposed during the recent strict account check.

　　五区第四、五中心合作社
    赵永祥等贪污被揭发
    【本报讯】五区第四、第五中心合作社，最近连续发现集体贪污事件，经调查研究，现决定将主谋贪污的赵永祥（五社主任）、张海泉（五社会计）、高启龙（五社执秤的）、韩德水（管理员，原在四社，后调至五社）等四人，予以撤职，并送法院法办；梅锡荣、那振明（五社管理员）伙同贪污，尚有部分案情未经判明，予以撤职，回家听候处理；赵光华（四社主任）、杨果洗（原系四社会计，后调到三社工作），不坚守自己岗位，包庇、参与贪污案件，予以撤职反省处分；黄慧娴（四社干部兼评功委员）随从贪污，记过一次，并取消其评功委员资格。五社管理员王长林，不同污合流，向上级反映情况，在会上受到了表扬。第五中心合作社，平时制度紊乱，经济手续不清。据现有统计，共亏粮一、八四四斤，此外擅自借出粮食一、○二五斤，亏面粉百余斤。总帐与明细帐查对结果，共差六十余万元。该社主任赵永祥，未经批准领先借粮五三七斤，借用公款十四万元，包庇本社干部贪污，不向上级报告。会计张海泉，主谋贪污，擅自赊欠粮食，动用公款，并以社内纸烟、面袋等，拉拢社员中的三轮工人代表及合作社干部。利用该社掌秤的高启龙，威胁异己，使社内赊欠成风。工作组于四月初查库时，该社干部多方作假，在满装砂土的麻袋上撒了一层玉米面，冒充二二○斤玉米面顶数。
    第四社主任赵光华，对工作素不负责，包庇、参与干部贪污，不向上级反映。韩德水在四社工作时，经手加工小麦和荞麦，贪污了伏地面八十斤（分了三十斤给会计杨果洗），荞面六十斤（分给杨会计十斤，分给该社女干部黄慧娴二十斤），豆皮一百斤（折款一五○○○元全社干部分用）。并用驼牌粉掺在天坛粉内出售，赚了面粉十余斤，现金数千元，由该社主任作主，全体干部聚了餐。韩德水还借用公款，代卖白薯，大秤进、小秤出，赊给商人。至今尚有六百余斤白薯价款未曾归还。该社会计杨果洗，与韩德水勾结贪污，黄慧娴身为评功委员，亦不向上级报告，直到杨果洗到三社工作办理移交时，才发现帐上亏欠四十余万元。当时杨果洗与主任赵光华私以杂货款项挪用抵补，企图蒙骗上级。最近严格查帐时才暴露了真象。
