Dalian Railway Factory Blacksmith Shop
Scrap Reduced by Half Compared to Previous Period

[This Newspaper's dispatch] Dalian People's Daily, April 16th dispatch: Thanks to the attention of cadres and the strengthening of responsibility by workers, the scrap at the China Changchun Railway Dalian Factory's blacksmith shop in March decreased from 196 kilograms to 89 kilograms compared to February, and reworked materials also decreased from 7.5 tons to 3.712 tons. Although the shop began to emphasize improving the quality of finished products and reducing scrap and rework as early as January of this year, the leadership only made general appeals. It neither strengthened education for workers nor proposed specific measures, so it did not attract the attention of team leaders and workers. In particular, because the finished product inspection records were written by the inspection section, team leaders could not grasp the daily amount of scrap and rework. Therefore, even when there was scrap, they could not promptly summarize the shortcomings and correct them in time. To overcome these shortcomings, the shop first strengthened the education of team leaders and workers on reducing rework and scrap. The importance was also emphasized through discussions at team leader meetings, and all were willing to take responsibility to do the work carefully and inspect carefully. For example, at the end of March, the blueprints for making freight car wheels received from the production section had incorrect dimensions. The team leader Wang Shou Peng inspected them before they were processed and immediately returned them, avoiding rework. In addition, cadres conducted ideological education for individual workers who were not responsible in their work and often held group meetings during lunch and after work to discuss how to reduce or eliminate scrap. If scrap occurred, the cause was investigated as a lesson learned, so the workers all took responsibility. For example, Wang Qishu, the team leader of the three-ton hammer group, was making a fifteen-ton crane boiler ring in early March. He first measured the dimensions, and then the worker Zhong Guo very responsibly measured them again, and found that Wang had measured 180 millimeters short. Most of the workers watching the hammers in the shop are young workers. In the past, they often produced scrap due to a lack of concentration, but now there has been great improvement through everyone's education and supervision. Therefore, Comrade Wang Shou Peng, the team leader, said, "In the past, the main problem was insufficient education of the workers, and at the same time, our cadres did not pay enough attention, so there was more scrap."

### 大连铁路工厂打铁场  废活较前减少一半

　　大连铁路工厂打铁场
    废活较前减少一半
    【本报讯】大连人民日报四月十六日消息：由于干部的重视及工友们加强了责任心，中长大连铁路工厂打铁场三月份废活与二月份对比，由一百九十六公斤减少到八十九公斤，反手活亦由七吨半减少到三吨七百十二公斤。该场虽然从今年一月即开始重视成品质量的提高，及废活与反手活的减少，但领导上只作了一般的号召，既未加强对工友的教育，也没提出具体办法，因此并未引起班组长及工友的重视。特别是因为该成品场检查账是由检查科负责写，班组长不能掌握每天废活及反工活的多少，因此有了废活也不能及时总结缺点及时克服纠正。为了克服这些缺点，该场首先加强了对班组长及工友减少反手活及废活的教育，并在班组长会上经大家讨论，加强了重视，都肯负起责任来仔细做，仔细检查。如三月末生产科下来的做货车轮子的图纸，尺码写的不对劲，在未干以前被王寿彭班长检查出来立即退回，避免了出反手活。另外干部对个别工作不负责任的工友进行了思想教育，经常在午饭及下班时间，开小组会讨论怎样减少或不出废活，如果出了废活就究其原因，做为经验教训，因此使工友们都负起了责任。如三吨大锤小组长王其书在三月初旬干十五吨吊车锅炉圈，他先量一遍尺码后，由忠国工友很负责任的又量了一遍，结果发现王组长量短了一百八十米厘。该场看锤的工友大部分是青年工友，他们过去因工作精神不集中而出废活的现象很多，但经大家教育与督促，现在大有改进。所以班长王寿彭同志说：“过去主要是对工友教育不够，同时我们干部也不大重视，所以废活就多”。
