　　Methods of Theoretical Study by the North China Bureau Organs Branch Leadership
　　Our Correspondent Shang Kai
　　The theoretical study of cadres in the organs of the North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China has embarked on regular study. Every morning at six o'clock, eighteen theoretical study groups of varying levels began their intense study. Some were burying themselves in reading, some were taking careful notes, and some were chatting or engaging in heated discussions. As some comrades in the organs of the North China Bureau said, "The North China Bureau in the morning looks like a school." They have already completed their study of political economy. The study of Imperialism will also be completed in mid-May.

　　Leaders' Concern and Help, General Branch's Assigned Leadership
　　The reason why the theoretical study of cadres in the organs of the North China Bureau has been so successful is primarily due to the constant concern and specific assistance given by the responsible comrades of the North China Bureau. They often take time out of their busy schedules to give reports or preside over discussion conferences to help solve difficult problems in the study. Administratively, they also strictly stipulate a daily study time of two hours for each person, which cannot be arbitrarily occupied unless there is a special accident, so that the cadres' study is effectively guaranteed. Secondly, the branch is leading the study with all its strength. The General Branch Committee is responsible for leading the first-level and second-level theoretical studies and a spare-time cultural school. The branch committee members are also specifically assigned to lead the various levels of study in their respective branches. The General Branch formulates a general study plan, and each branch formulates a study plan for each stage based on the general plan, specifically stipulating the study progress and study methods. This planned and step-by-step leadership has played a decisive role in ensuring the study. For example, the outline of the 1950 theoretical study trial plan of the organs of the North China Bureau stipulates that the first-level study progress from March to December will sequentially complete the four books Imperialism, State and Revolution, Foundations of Leninism, and Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder, and stipulates the time limit for studying each book. The specific study plan of the Secretariat Branch for the first stage of studying Imperialism is to first spend a week reading the whole book roughly, then spend six weeks reading and discussing in small groups, and finally set aside ten days for general discussion, review, testing, and summary, according to the spirit of the General Branch. The whole book has one hundred and seventy-one pages, and excluding rough reading, review, and holiday breaks, a progress of four pages per day is required. In order to maintain the study progress and complete the study plan on schedule, the branch also proposed that each group and each person should formulate their own study plan.

　　Strictly Enforce the Study System to Ensure the Completion of the Study Plan
　　In order to ensure the realization of the study plan, each branch, according to the spirit of the General Branch and in combination with the work situation of its own department, has detailedly stipulated various study systems and strictly enforced them. The study plan of the Propaganda Department Branch especially emphasizes that everyone must strictly observe the study time, not be late or leave early, and must ask the group leader for leave if work makes it necessary to delay the study. The branch also stipulates a reporting system in which the study group leader reports to the branch Propaganda Committee once every two weeks. When some cadres go out to inspect work, the branch Propaganda Committee sometimes contacts them. After they come back, they must report the study situation outside to the group, and the group leader is responsible for checking. If they delay their study outside, they must use various methods to catch up after they come back. The study system of the Organization Department Branch also stipulates that the branch will separately convene a joint meeting of first-level and second-level study group leaders every Sunday evening to check the study situation of the week, solve the problems that occur in the study, and discuss and arrange the study for the next week.

　　Another effective method of the General Branch's leadership of study is timely inspection and supervision. In addition to convening a joint meeting of branch Propaganda Committees every two weeks or so to listen to reports, the General Branch also regularly collects problems in the study and distributes them to each branch for reference. Sometimes it also provides some reference book lists, prints explanations of terms, sometimes introduces learning experiences from various places, or invites experts to give reports, and subscribes to a study magazine for each group. After finishing the study of political economy, it has planned and prepared three large discussions. The leaders of the organs were invited to personally guide, which was a relatively successful method, and they plan to continue to adopt it when needed and possible. At the same time, the General Branch solemnly announced that the attitude and results of study are one of the important items in the cadre assessment. These measures have played a great role in deepening the study, solving difficult problems, and stimulating learning emotions.

　　Overcome Dependence, Adjust Study Organization
　　At the beginning of the branch study of the organs of the North China Bureau, there were two more significant ideological obstacles among some cadres. The first is the dependence on theoretical study. When comrades encounter difficult problems in their studies, they are not good at studying and discussing, and think that they cannot solve them themselves, and always hope that someone will give a report. In this case, the questions raised are very messy, and because the people who raise the questions have not done in-depth research in advance, the questions are not raised clearly and specifically enough. Therefore, it is difficult for people to give reports that can really help everyone improve. Therefore, the General Branch put forward the slogan of "relying on ourselves as much as possible to solve problems." For example, after finishing the study of political economy, the General Branch collected difficult problems from each group and distributed them to everyone for full preparation. Then, a general discussion was held, and Comrade Zhang Panshi, Minister of Propaganda, was invited to preside over it personally. The most intense debate in the discussion was on the chapter on commodity production, with speakers accounting for more than one-third of those present. Minister Zhang seized on the crux of the discussion at any time, and gave enlightenment and guidance to help everyone correct various incorrect views. This conference was an outstanding manifestation of ideological leadership; the cadres initially understood that only after they had deeply considered, repeatedly studied, and discussed the problems themselves, could other people's reports help them. The mood and confidence in learning have been improved accordingly.

　　Another ideological deviation in the study is that some cadres mistakenly regard theoretical study as a "political treatment." Some people are limited by their cultural level and are not suitable for studying twelve books, but they reluctantly participate, and as a result, they cannot chew them, cannot get into them, and feel great distress. This has a great impact on the learning mood and learning progress. The General Branch then proposed to adjust the study organization and reorganize the groups separately. Each branch carried out ideological mobilization separately and explained the significance of adjusting the study organization. First, it explained that both the first-level and second-level are theoretical studies, and there is no distinction between high and low. The study of preliminary theoretical books is precisely to prepare conditions for studying twelve books. Secondly, it explained that theoretical study and cultural study are equally important and are both one of the study tasks. Cultural study is to lay the foundation for studying theory. If you do not study culture well, you cannot study theory, so the grouping of cadres has nothing to do with the level of position. After deliberation and discussion, everyone solved the problem ideologically, and all consciously registered to participate in the first-level and second-level theoretical studies, or cultural studies, according to their own level, and then the branch reviewed it. As a result of the adjustment, among the more than 170 cadres who participated in the study of political economy last year, more than 30 people were incorporated into the second-level to study preliminary theoretical books, and a few individuals were incorporated into cultural studies. However, in the review, the branch also paid attention to this situation and corrected it when it should have participated in the first-level study according to its theoretical and cultural level but registered to participate in the second-level.

　　Self-study Combined with Discussion, Mutual Assistance between Groups
　　The study method is mainly self-study, rough reading, careful reading, research and thinking, combined with chatting and discussion. But in the process of learning, everyone is encouraged to help each other and inspire each other. This method of mutual assistance and inspiration has played a great role in the study of the North China Bureau. The first is the mutual assistance between the first-level and second-level, that is, if the problems discussed by the first-level study group are related to the second-level study, the second-level study group that is close by will participate to get inspiration. If the second-level study group encounters problems that cannot be solved, the first-level study group will go to the second-level study group to participate in the discussion to help solve the problems. As a result, the problems that cannot be solved in the second-level study group are often solved by the comrades in the first-level group studying and discussing together. Secondly, there is the mutual assistance relationship between the same level of theoretical study. If a certain branch or group encounters problems that cannot be solved, it will go to another branch or group to listen to the central speech, get inspiration, and come back to expand the discussion, and the understanding of the problem will be easier to deepen. In addition, the General Branch calls on each group to make full use of the "Study" magazine, and if problems cannot be solved in the study, they will be submitted to the editorial board of the magazine for answers. In addition to this, listen to radio lectures every night. What you have learned can be used as a review, and what you have not learned can also prepare you for future studies.

　　However, the responsible comrades of the General Branch believe that there are still some problems in the current study, and they have begun to pay attention to research and solutions. First, individual cadres still tend to chew on terms hard. Second, the connection between theoretical study and current practical problems is generally not well resolved. Many cadres are not good at connecting with reality, which is an important problem in theoretical study. Third, there are several types of organ study organizations, and the General Branch Committee members are also responsible cadres administratively, which makes it difficult to lead these types of studies concurrently.

　　华北局机关支部领导理论学习的方法
    本报记者  商恺
    中共中央华北局机关干部的理论学习，已走上正规学习。每天早晨六点钟，不同程度的十八个理论学习小组就开始了紧张的学习，有的在埋头阅读，有的在认真的笔记，有的在漫谈或热烈的讨论。诚如华北局机关一些同志们所说：早晨的华北局，活像一座学校。他们已经学完了政治经济学。帝国主义论的学习又将于五月中旬结束。
    首长关心帮助  总支分工领导
    华北局机关干部学习之所以搞得好，首先是由于华北局各负责同志，经常关心并具体帮助干部们的学习。他们常从百忙中抽出时间作报告或主持讨论大会，帮助解决学习中的疑难问题。行政上并严格规定每人每天两小时的学习时间，除非特别事故，不得随意侵占，使干部学习得到了切实保证。其次，则是支部以全力来领导学习。总支委分别负责领导甲乙两级理论学习，和一个业余文化学校。各支部委员也具体分工领导各该支部的各级学习。总支制订总的学习计划，各支部根据总计划制订每一阶段的学习计划，具体规定学习进度和学习方法。这种有计划有步骤的领导，对保证学习曾起了决定的作用。例如华北局机关一九五○年理论学习试行计划纲要中的甲级学习进度中，规定从三月至十二月依次学完帝国主义论、国家与革命、论列宁主义的基础、左派幼稚病等四本书，并规定每书学习的期限。秘书处支部第一阶段学习帝国主义论的具体学习计划就是根据总支精神规定先用一周时间将全书粗读一遍，再以六周时间进行精读和小组讨论，最后十天留作大会讨论、复习、测验和总结。全书一百七十一页，除去粗读、复习和假期休息，要求每日有四页的进度。为了保持学习进度和学习计划的按期完成，支部还提议每组每人都订出自己的学习计划。
    严格执行学习制度  保证学习计划完成
    为了保证学习计划的实现，各支部根据总支精神，结合自己部门的工作情况，详尽地规定了各种学习制度，并严格地加以执行。宣传部支部的学习计划中，特别强调每人必须严格遵守学习时间，不准迟到和早退，有时因工作确实不得不耽误学习时，也须向组长请假。该支部还规定学习小组长每两周向支部汇报一次的汇报制度。有些干部出去检查工作时，支部宣委有时还和他们联系。他们回来后须向小组报告在外学习情况，小组长负责检查。如在外面耽误学习，回来后须用种种方法补赶。组织部支部的学习制度，也规定每星期日晚上，由支部分别召集甲乙两级学习组长联席会，检查一周学习情况，解决学习中发生的问题，并商讨布置下周学习。
    总支领导学习的另一种有效方法是及时的检查督促。总支除了两周左右召集一次支宣联席会听取汇报外，并经常收集学习中的问题，分发各支部参考。有时还提供一些参考书目，印发名词解释，有时介绍各地学习经验，或请专家报告，并为每组订阅学习杂志一份。在学完政治经济学后，曾有计划有准备的组织了三次大讨论。请机关首长亲临指导，这是比较成功的一种方法，在需要与可能的情况下，他们拟继续采用。同时，总支并郑重宣布，学习态度和成绩是干部考绩重要项目之一。这些措施对学习深入和解决疑难问题，激发学习情绪，都起了很大作用。
    克服依赖思想  调整学习组织
    华北局机关支部学习之初，部分干部中，存在着两种比较显著的思想障碍。首先是理论学习中的依赖思想。同志们在学习中遇到困难问题时，不善于钻研讨论，认为自己无法解决，总希望有人作报告。在这种情形下提出的问题就非常零乱，又因为提问题的人事先未做深入研究，问题就提得不够明确具体。所以请人作报告也就很难真正对每个人有所帮助提高。因此总支提出尽量“依靠自己，解决问题”的口号。如学完政治经济学后，总支汇集各组疑难问题，印发大家作充分准备。然后召开大会讨论，并请宣传部长张磐石同志亲临主持。讨论中争辩最激烈的是商品生产一章，发言人占出席人数三分之一强。张部长随时抓住讨论中的症结，进行启发诱导，帮助大家纠正各种不正确的观点。这次大会是思想领导的突出表现；干部们由此初步懂得了只有自己对问题经过深思熟虑反复钻研讨论后，别人的报告才能对自己有所帮助。学习的情绪和信心随之提高。
    学习中的另一种思想偏差，是部分干部误把理论学习当成“政治待遇”，有些人限于文化水平，不适宜于学十二本书，而勉强参加，结果啃不动，钻不进，感到很大苦恼。对学习情绪和学习进度影响颇大。总支遂提出调整学习组织分别编组的号召。各支部分头进行思想动员，解释调整学习组织的意义。第一、说明甲乙两级都是理论学习，并无高低之分，初步理论书籍的学习，正是为了给学十二本书准备条件。其次说明理论学习与文化学习同等重要，都是学习任务之一，文化学习是为学理论打基础的，不学好文化就无法学习理论，因之干部分组学习与职位高低完全无关。经过酝酿讨论，大家从思想上解决了问题，都根据自己的水平，自觉地报名参加甲级和乙级理论学习，或文化学习，然后由支部审查。调整的结果，去年参加学习政治经济学的一百七十多个干部中，有三十多人编入乙级，另学初步的理论书籍，也有个别的人编入文化学习。但也有根据其理论文化水平本应参加甲级学习而报名参加乙级的，支部在审查时，也注意了这一情况，予以改正。
    自学为主结合讨论  组级之间开展互助
    学习方法以自学为主，粗读精读，钻研思考，结合漫谈和讨论。但在学习过程中，则提倡大家互相帮助、互相启发。这种互助启发的方式，在华北局的学习中曾发挥了很大的作用。首先是甲乙两级间的互助，即甲级学习组讨论的问题与乙级学习有关，离得近的乙级学习组便去参加，借以得到启发。乙级学习组如遇有不能解决的问题，甲级学习组即去乙级学习组参加讨论，帮助解决问题。这样做的结果，常使乙级学习组中不能解决的问题，在甲级组同志一块研究讨论中得到解决。其次，是同级理论学习间的互助关系。某个支部或小组，遇有不能解决的问题，便到别个支部或小组去听中心发言，得到启发，回来再展开讨论，对问题的了解便容易深入一步。另外总支号召各小组要充分利用“学习”杂志，在学习中解决不了的问题，便向该刊编委会提出请其解答。除此每晚还收听广播讲座，已学过的作为温习，未学的，也可给将来的学习作准备。
    但总支负责同志认为目前学习中还存在一些问题，现已开始注意研究解决。一、个别干部还有硬啃名词的偏向。二、理论学习与当前实际问题的联系，一般说来还未解决得很好，不少干部不善于联系实际，这是理论学习中的一个重要问题。三、机关学习组织有好几种，总支委员又都是行政上的负责干部，兼任这几种学习的领导有困难。
