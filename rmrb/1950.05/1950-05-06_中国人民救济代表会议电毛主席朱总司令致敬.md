　　Telegram of Respect from the Representatives' Meeting of the Chinese People's Relief to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu
    [Xinhua News Agency] At the closing session of the Representatives' Meeting of the Chinese People's Relief, all the representatives sent letters of respect to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central People's Government and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the People's Liberation Army. The original letters are as follows:

    (I) Letter to Chairman Mao Zedong
    Respected Chairman Mao:

    The Representatives' Meeting of the Chinese People's Relief has successfully concluded today, and we, all the representatives, would like to extend our highest respects to you!

    For over a hundred years, the exploitation and oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism have caused endless suffering to the Chinese people. They are the very creators of the poverty and disasters of the people nationwide.

    Today, under your wise leadership, the Chinese people have overthrown the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and have taken the power into their own hands, eradicating the fundamental source of disasters, and creating the basic conditions for eliminating disasters.

    Although the evils of reactionary rule cannot be overcome in the short term, the People's Government immediately devoted great efforts to healing the wounds of war and providing disaster relief after liberation. The large-scale production-for-relief and relief campaigns currently underway in various regions demonstrate that our government and people are united in heart and mind and have the strength to overcome any difficulties.

    This meeting of ours is a unity conference for relief and welfare workers across the country. In order to effectively mobilize various social forces to assist the government in engaging in relief and welfare undertakings for the masses of the people, we have established a new national relief organization—the Chinese People's Relief Association. We guarantee that under your leadership and the leadership of the Central People's Government, we will adhere to the principles of production and thrift, mutual aid in labor, and strive to eliminate disasters, accelerate construction, and realize a prosperous and happy New China.

     With respectful greetings,
     All Representatives of the Representatives' Meeting of the Chinese People's Relief
     April 29, 1950

    (II) Letter to Commander-in-Chief Zhu De
    Respected Commander-in-Chief Zhu:

    Just as the Representatives' Meeting of the Chinese People's Relief was in session, the good news of the People's Liberation Army's victorious landing on Hainan Island arrived. Overwhelmed with joy and excitement, let us take this opportunity of the closing of the meeting to extend our sincere respect to you!

    The heroic and invincible People's Liberation Army has won the victory of the people's revolutionary war, enabling New China to embark on a great period of peaceful construction. This is inseparable from Chairman Mao's wise leadership and your command of operations.

    The People's Liberation Army, under your command, has not only driven out the reactionary rulers who created disasters, but also, under your leadership, engaged in saving grain for disaster relief, water control and land reclamation, and the construction of railways and highways, truly worthy of being the most loyal and good sons and daughters of the people's motherland.

    We, all the representatives, are willing to learn from the spirit of the People's Liberation Army in serving the people wholeheartedly, and resolutely assist the people in eliminating disasters and promoting the New Democratic relief and welfare undertakings.

     With respectful greetings,
     All Representatives of the Representatives' Meeting of the Chinese People's Relief
     April 29, 1950

    【新华社讯】中国人民救济代表会议闭幕会上全体代表曾致函中央人民政府毛泽东主席与人民解放军朱德总司令致敬。原函如下：
    （一）致毛泽东主席函敬爱的毛主席：
    中国人民救济代表会议今天胜利闭幕了，我们全体代表谨向你致崇高的敬礼！
    百余年来，帝国主义、封建主义、和官僚资本主义的剥削压迫，给中国人民造成了无限的痛苦。它们正是全国人民的贫困和灾难的制造者。
    今天，在您的英明领导下，中国人民推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治，把政权掌握在人民自己手中，铲除了灾难的总根源，已为消灭灾难造成基本的条件。
    虽然反动统治的恶果，不是短期所能克服的，可是解放后人民政府立即大力医治战争创伤和救济灾荒。目前各地展开的大规模的生产救灾运动和救济运动，正显示了我们政府和人民同心协力，完全有力量战胜任何困难。
    我们这次会议是全国救济福利工作者的团结大会。为了有效地动员各种社会力量，协助政府，从事人民大众的救济、福利事业，我们成立了新的全国性救济机构——中国人民救济总会。我们保证在您和中央人民政府的领导下，坚持生产节约、劳动互助的原则，为消灭灾难，加速建设，实现富强康乐的新中国而奋斗。此致敬礼
     中国人民救济代表会议全体代表
     一九五○年四月二十九日
    （二）致朱德总司令函敬爱的朱总司令：
    正当中国人民救济代表会议开会期间，传来了人民解放军在海南岛胜利登陆的捷报。腾欢鼓舞之余，让我们乘此会议闭幕的时机，向你致热诚的敬意！
    英勇无敌的人民解放军赢得了人民革命战争的胜利，使新中国走上伟大的和平建设时期，这是与毛主席的英明领导和您的作战指挥不可分离的。
    人民解放军既在你的指挥下驱除了制造灾难的反动统治者；又在你的领导下，从事节粮救灾，治水垦荒，修筑铁路、公路，真不愧为人民祖国最忠诚的好儿女。
    我们全体代表愿学习人民解放军全心全意为人民服务的精神，坚决协助人民消灭灾难，促进新民主主义的救济、福利事业。
     此致敬礼
     中国人民救济代表会议全体代表
