　　Stable Prices, People Happily Use Currency for Transactions
    Renminbi Reaches Rural Areas in Chahar and Shanxi Provinces   
    Legitimate Industry and Commerce Develop Under Favorable Conditions
    [Report from this newspaper, Zhangjiakou] In various parts of Chahar Province, due to stable prices, the masses' psychology of "valuing goods over currency" has changed, and the Renminbi is now circulating widely in rural areas. At the same time, because the currency value is stable, legitimate industry and commerce have gained favorable conditions for development.
    After the establishment of the Trade Treasury in Zhangjiakou City on March 11, state-owned specialized companies vigorously promoted the sale of goods in order to complete the task of currency withdrawal. They also sent sales teams carrying large quantities of sugar, cloth, and other groceries to Zhangbei, Shangdu, and other places, closely cooperating with the grain company's purchases, so that farmers could buy daily necessities after selling grain. This not only reduced the price of general groceries by 50% compared to the past, reducing the exploitation suffered by farmers, but also opened up the currency front. The Egg Products Company also organized four purchase teams in northern Chahar, combining with the department store and grain companies to use currency to purchase eggs from the masses. In Zhangbei alone, an average of about 20,000 eggs (priced at 210 to 220 yuan each) could be purchased daily, thereby expanding the local currency market. According to reports from various places, most of the peddlers running to the villages now carry currency, and most transactions are done in currency. In the past, farmers would not bring a single penny back after selling grain in the city, but now, in addition to buying some necessities, most of the currency is brought back to the villages. For example, in the past, county and district cadres brought grain coupons with them when they went to the countryside, and paid for some vegetable money with currency, but the masses were reluctant to accept it. Now that grain coupons have been abolished and currency is used entirely, the masses are happy to accept it. Furthermore, in the grain companies of Yuxian and Shacheng in southern Chahar, when they exchanged cloth for grain from the masses, some people said, "In the past, we were afraid of losing out, so we had to have real goods. Now that prices are stable, giving us real goods is too inconvenient to carry around." Therefore, they also switched to currency. Renminbi is now being used within ten miles around Datong, as well as on the two main roads connecting Guangling, Lingqiu, and Shuoxian. The amount of currency in circulation in Baokang accounts for 80% of market transactions, Baoyuan 50%, and Duolun 60%. Renminbi is also circulating in villages forty miles away from Shangdu. Legitimate industry and commerce are also doing better business due to stable prices and the stable value of the Renminbi, which allows them to maintain a certain profit. For example, Fu Xingde Wang Ru, who runs a Guangzhou goods business, said, "In the past, when buying goods in Beijing, we would take the goods first and pay later, often settling in cloth, but the price of cloth rose faster than the price of Guangzhou goods, so we suffered a lot. Now that prices are stable, it doesn't matter if we delay payment for half a month or twenty days." (Ren)
    [Report from this newspaper, Taiyuan] Market prices in various cities and counties of Shanxi Province have become stable, the credit of the local currency has gradually increased, and it has begun to circulate steadily in rural areas, initially reversing the situation of farmers "bartering" or using silver dollars. Since mid-March of this year, the trend of declining prices for various goods in Shanxi, starting from Taiyuan, has spread to all large and small counties and towns in the province (with grain and cloth prices falling the most). As a result, merchants have first shifted from scrambling to store materials to selling them at low prices, and deposits in local banks have also been increasing daily. According to the statistics of the savings office of the Shanxi branch of the People's Bank, the deposit balance at the end of March increased three times compared with April 18; the deposit balance of private merchants increased sharply by 6.5 times during the same period. At the same time, the purchasing power of the currency has also relatively increased. One yuan of Renminbi in December of last year was only equal to 0.49 yuan on March 11 of this year, but it increased to 0.6 yuan on April 19. The general farmers have also increased their trust in the Renminbi. For example, farmers near Xiaodian Town in Jinyuan, a newly liberated area, used to exchange all the grain they sold at the market for real goods. If they had any money left over, they would rather buy cakes and eat them all than bring them back. Now they are happy to trade in currency. According to the statistics of the tax office in the town, in the twenty-three days before April 18, a total of thirty-one mules and horses were traded, of which twenty-four were traded in currency. Farmers in Wutai and other places in northern Shanxi are now willing to keep currency on hand. For example, in Wenxing Village in Wutai County, it used to be difficult to find 100,000 banknotes, but now it is easy to find 500,000 yuan. Also, in the past, private debts had to be converted into grain, cloth and other real goods, but now there is no need to convert them anymore.

　　物价稳定人民乐用货币交易
    察晋两省人民币下乡   
    正当工商业发展获有利条件
    【本报张家口讯】察哈尔省各地由于物价稳定，群众“重货轻币”心理已有转变，广大农村已流通人民币。同时因为币值稳定，使正当工商业发展获得了有利的条件。
    张家口市于三月十一日建立了贸易金库后，各国营专业公司为了完成货币回笼任务，均大力推销商品，并派推销小组携带大批糖、布等杂货赴张北、商都等地推销，并与粮食公司的收购密切配合，使农民卖出粮食后即可买到日用品。这不但使一般杂货较前落价百分之五十，减轻了农民所受到的中间剥削，同时也打开了货币阵地。蛋品公司在察北亦组织四个收购小组，结合百货、粮食两公司用货币收购群众鸡蛋，仅张北一地平均每日即可收购鸡蛋二万个左右（每个二百一十元至二百二十元），因而扩大了本币市场，现据各地报道：跑乡村的小贩大部均带货币下乡，交易大部用货币了。从前农民进城卖粮后，一文钱都不带回去，现在则除了买部分必需品外，大部货币都带回乡村去了。又如过去县、区干部下乡全带粮票，部分菜金用货币支付，群众尚有不愿接受者。现在粮票已经取消，完全用货币，群众也乐于接受了。再如察南蔚县、沙城的粮食公司，曾以土布换群众粮食，有的人说：“以前怕吃亏，不得不要实物，现在物价稳定了还给实物，提来提去太不方便。”因此也改成货币了。在大同周围十里以及通广灵、灵邱及朔县的两条大道，都已使用了人民币。保康货币流通量占市场交易比重已达百分之八十，宝源达百分之五十，多伦达百分之六十，商都离城四十里远的乡村也流通了人民币。正当工商业也因物价平稳，人民币币值稳定，能保持一定的利润而卖买好做了。如广货业复兴德王儒说：“过去到北京买货，先取货、后付款，往往折成布付给，而布价涨得比广货快，故吃亏很大。现在物价平稳了，拖欠半月二十天也没大关系。（仁）
    【本报太原讯】山西省各市县市场物价，已趋平稳，本币信用逐步提高，并开始在农村稳步流通，初步扭转了农民“以物易物”或使用白洋的局面。从本年三月中旬起，山西各种货物价格从太原开始下落的趋势，现已遍及全省各大小县镇（其中以粮、布价格下降幅度最大）。因而一般商民首先从过去的争相购存物资转变为低价抛售物资，各地银行的存款，亦日有增加。据人民银行山西分行储蓄办事处统计，该处三月底的存款余额与四月十八日相比增加了三倍；私商存款余额同时期则骤增六·五倍。同时，货币购买力也已相对提高。去年十二月人民币一元到今年三月十一日则仅等于○·四九元，到四月十九日提高为○·六元。一般农民亦增强了对人民币的信任。如新区晋源小店镇附近农民，在以前背粮到集出卖后，都换成实物，有余钱宁可买饼吃光也不愿带回去，现在则已乐于用货币成交了。据该镇税务所统计：四月十八日以前二十三天中，骡马成交共三十一头，其中二十四头是用货币成交的。晋北五台等地农民已愿在手边保有货币，如五台县文兴村百户人家，以前想找十万票子很困难，现在要找五十万元也容易了。又，从前私人欠债均要折成粮、布等实物，现在已不必再折了。
