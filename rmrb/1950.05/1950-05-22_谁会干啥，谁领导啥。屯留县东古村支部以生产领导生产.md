　　Editor's Note: Currently, many rural branches have put forward the slogan of "leading production with production," but lack concrete experience. The Donggu Village Branch in Tunliu County has adopted the method of "whoever knows what, leads what," enabling Party members to utilize their expertise in production to help the masses solve problems. This also resolves the contradiction between Party members leading others' production and their own production. We are publishing this experience for rural branches in various regions to reference.

The Donggu Village Branch in Tunliu County, Shanxi Province, has adopted the method of leading production with production and has achieved excellent results in leading production work.

The Party members of the Donggu Village Branch generally improved their awareness after rectifying the Party and concluding the land reform work last winter. Most Party members are very active in their work, and general Party members can also complete their work tasks. The branch also frequently pays attention to leading and assisting the work of the Communist Youth League, making the League members powerful assistants to the branch.

The Donggu Village Branch's method of leading production with production is as follows: Regardless of the type of production activity, it is always appropriately divided at the branch meeting first. The branch committee is jointly responsible for the overall leadership. In specific production work, specific assignments are made within the Party members based on the principle of "whoever knows what, leads what." In this way, on the one hand, leadership can be combined with practice, Party work becomes more in-depth, and the relationship between the Party and the masses becomes closer. On the other hand, Party members' own production can be combined with leading the masses' production. For example, Party member Xue Yuquan is an expert in fertilizer accumulation, so the branch assigned him to lead fertilizer accumulation work. After receiving this task, Xue Yuquan, in addition to mobilizing the village's two flocks of sheep to the masses for manure accumulation, also brought in two flocks of sheep from other villages to accumulate manure for the masses. The four flocks of sheep accumulated a total of 8,400 dan of fertilizer in two months. Based on the calculation that the entire village applies 58 dan of fertilizer per mu this year, it can solve the manure shortage for more than 144 mu of land. Because fertilizer accumulation is one of the basic conditions for increasing agricultural production, the branch decided to launch a movement to build smoking kilns to expand fertilizer sources. However, the masses of Donggu Village are not accustomed to using this method. After research, the branch decided to let Party members Wang Gouhai and Cui Wanyu be responsible for leading this movement, and they took the lead themselves. The Communist Youth League branch also held discussions among its members, and the members took the lead in mobilizing the youth to work together and promoted the benefits of building smoking kilns among the masses. This gradually mobilized the masses, resulting in the construction of 62 smoking kilns, totaling 7,795 dan of fertilizer, which, calculated at an average of 58 dan of manure per mu, can supply more than 134 mu of land.

When the spring plowing preparation work began, the branch decided to let the experienced Party member Feng Enxi lead the repair and replacement of farm tools. Feng Enxi actively united with non-Party cadre Li Shufang to complete this task. They hired two blacksmiths from other villages and organized three carpenters from this village, repairing and replacing 17 large and small carts, hoes, shovels, rakes, and other farm tools for the masses of the village, solving the farm tool difficulties in the spring plowing.

In leading sideline production, the branch also made similar divisions within the Party. Female Party member Li Laqun is responsible for raising chickens and pigs. She is the chairwoman of the village women's association and is very active in her work. At the women's association cadre meeting, she mobilized everyone, saying: "To lead production, you must first do it yourself." So, the cadres first made a plan, each incubating a nest of chickens, raising a pig, and also participating in hoeing the fields. When organizing the masses to engage in transportation, it was led by Party members Shen Xianqi and Feng Nanxi, who owned livestock and loved transportation. They are experienced in finding labor and soliciting business, and the masses trust them very much. From the beginning of leading transportation, they have thought of ways and offered suggestions to the masses in many ways. They found vehicles for the masses who did not have them and raised funds for the masses who wanted to buy livestock. In this way, the masses had great enthusiasm for transportation. Last winter, 37 vehicles participated in transportation, earning a total of 32 shi and 7 dou of rice. This spring, 21 vehicles participated, making six trips and earning 90 shi of rice. In addition, 20 vehicles made two trips, and 10 vehicles made one trip, earning a total of 40 shi of corn. This spring, 51 heads of livestock participated in transportation, accounting for 85 percent of the total number of livestock in the village.

The branch also has a sound meeting reporting system in leading production. It holds regular meetings to deploy tasks, inspect work, solve problems in a timely manner, and carry out criticism and self-criticism in conjunction with inspection of work, which has greatly promoted the leadership of production.

### 谁会干啥，谁领导啥。屯留县东古村支部以生产领导生产

　　谁会干啥，谁领导啥。屯留县东古村支部以生产领导生产
    李生路
    编者按：目前不少农村支部提出了以生产领导生产的口号，但缺乏具体经验。山西屯留县东古村支部采取了“谁会啥谁领导啥”的办法，使党员发挥自己在生产上的特长，帮助群众解决问题。同时也解决了党员领导别人生产和自己生产的矛盾。我们把这个经验发表出来供各地农村支部参考。
    山西屯留县东古村支部采取了以生产领导生产的方法，在领导生产工作上取得了很好的成绩。
    东古村支部的党员，在去冬进行了整党和结束土地改革工作后，觉悟普遍提高。大部党员工作都很积极，一般党员也都能完成工作任务。支部并且经常注意领导与帮助青年团的工作，使团员们成为支部的有力助手。
    东古村支部以生产领导生产的办法是：不论那一个生产活动，总是先在支部会议上进行适当分工。在总的领导方面，由支委共同负责。在具体的生产工作上，则根据谁会啥谁领导啥的原则，在党员内进行具体分工。这样，一方面可以使领导与实际结合，党的工作更深入，党群关系更为密切，又可以使党员自己生产与领导群众生产相结合。比如：党员薛玉全是个积肥能手，支部便分配他领导积肥工作。薛玉全分得这个任务后，除有计划地把本村的两群羊动员给群众楂圈积羊肥外，又到外村揽来了两群羊给群众积肥。四群羊两个月中共积肥八千四百担。按全村今年每亩上肥五十八担计算，可以解决一百四十四亩多地的粪土困难。因为积肥是农业增产的基本条件之一，所以支部又决定展开垒薰洞运动，以扩大肥料来源。但是东古村群众是不习惯用这种方法的。支部经过研究，决定让党员王狗亥、崔万玉两人负责领导这一运动，并首先由他们自己带头干起来。青年团支部也在团员内进行了酝酿讨论，团员们带头发动青年一起干起来。并在群众中宣传垒薰洞的好处。这样逐渐发动起群众，共垒薰洞六十二个，合计积肥七千七百九十五担，按每亩平均上粪五十八担计，可供一百三十四亩多地用。
    春耕准备工作开始时，支部决定让有经验的党员冯恩锡领导修理和添置农具。冯恩锡积极地团结了非党干部李树芳一块来完成这个任务。他们在外村约了两个铁匠炉，又组织起本村三个木匠，共给本村群众修理和添置大小车十七辆、钁、锨、锄、耙等农具一百二十五件。解决了春耕中的农具困难问题。
    在副业生产的领导上，支部在党内也进行了同样的分工，女党员李腊群负责养鸡、养猪。她是村妇会主席，工作很积极。她在妇会干部会上动员大家说：“领导生产得自己先干。”于是干部们先作了计划，每人先孵一窝鸡，养一口猪，并且自己也参加锄地。在组织群众搞运输时，便由自己喂有牲口而又爱搞运输的党员申显奇、冯南喜负责领导。他们在找脚、揽脚，出门各方面都有经验，群众对他俩都很信任。从领导搞运输开始，他们就多方面的给群众想办法，出主意。给没车的群众找车，给要买牲口的群众凑款项。这样，使群众搞运输的劲头很大。去冬参加运输的有三十七辆车，共赚米三十二石七斗。今春参加有二十一个车，走了六趟，赚米九十石。另有二十辆车走两次，十辆车走一次，共赚玉茭四十石。今春参加运输的牲口有五十一头，占全村牲口数的百分之八十五。
    支部在领导生产上还有着健全的会议汇报制度。定期开会，布置任务，检查工作，及时解决问题，并结合检查工作展开批评和自我批评，对于领导生产起了很大的推动作用。
