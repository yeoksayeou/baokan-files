Regarding the Work Style of Cadres at the Beijing West Railway Station Freight Handling Department: Reply to Criticism from the Tianjin Railway Administration

To the Editors:

After reading the article "The Work System and Cadre Style of the Beijing West Railway Station Freight Handling Department Should Be Inspected" published in the People's Garden section of the People's Daily on April 5th, we immediately conducted an investigation. The investigation is now complete. The four sorghum milling machines consigned by the Civil Affairs Section of the First District People's Government of Beijing did indeed arrive on March 16th, but the Beijing West Railway Station repeatedly told the consignor that they had not arrived. When the goods were picked up on March 20th, they insisted on collecting storage fees and made various irresponsible remarks. This is not only unreasonable but also violates regulations and discipline. In addition to sending personnel to return the improperly collected storage fee of 35,500 yuan to the Civil Affairs Section, the irresponsible employees of the Beijing West Railway Station have been given penalties ranging from major demerit, demerit, and criticism.

We deeply appreciate the First District People's Government of Beijing Civil Affairs Section for their concern for the People's Railway in raising their concerns. We will further strengthen employee education in the future to prevent such incidents from happening again.

　　关于北京西站运货处干部作风
    天津铁路管理局来信答复批评编辑同志：
    四月五日人民日报人民园地上发表了《北京西站运货处工作制度干部作风，应加检查》一文，我们看到后，立即进行调查。现已调查清楚。北京市第一区公所民政科托运的四台高粮米机确在三月十六日运到，而北京西站屡次对货主说没有运到。及至三月二十日提取时，反坚持收保管费，并说出种种不负责任的话。这不但不合情理，更是违反规章纪律的行为。除将滥收的保管费三万五千五百元派人送还民政科外，对北京西站不负责任的职工分别予以记大过，记过及批评处分。
    对北京第一区公所民政科以爱护人民铁路的热忱，提出意见，我们深致感谢。我们今后要更进一步的加强职工教育，不使这样事件再度发生。
