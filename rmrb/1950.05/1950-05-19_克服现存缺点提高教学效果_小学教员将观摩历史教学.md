　　Overcome Existing Shortcomings and Improve Teaching Effectiveness
　　Elementary School Teachers to Observe History Teaching
[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, based on some problems existing in the current history teaching in elementary schools, has decided to hold an elementary school history observation teaching session to improve teaching methods and enhance teaching effectiveness. The bureau convened a meeting on the 16th to uniformly arrange this work.
　　According to usual understanding, the following shortcomings exist in history teaching in Beijing's elementary schools:
　　1. Errors in viewpoint; a blurred understanding of who is the master of history, who is the sinner of history; who is revolutionary, and who is counter-revolutionary. For example, referring to Emperor Taizong of Tang as "the leader of the Tang Dynasty People's Government," and saying "Zeng Guofan was a great man with ability, accomplishment, and good ideas," etc.
　　2. Unclear teaching objectives. Teachers fail to grasp the key points of the lesson, copying down as much reference material related to the lesson as possible, without knowing how to properly select and discard, lacking analysis and synthesis, causing students to become dizzy and unable to find the center of the lesson.
　　3. Unfamiliarity with historical facts. Some issues are passed over vaguely, without being thoroughly explained. For example, when talking about the Soviet Union's assistance to China, only saying "The Soviet Union has always helped China." As for how the Soviet Union helped China, how it helped in the past, how it helps now, why it helps China, and the great internationalist spirit of the Soviet Union, these issues are not clearly explained, or only some abstract concepts are mentioned.
　　4. Only telling stories, not teaching the lesson, failing to enable students to gain a systematic historical concept; and some even mix myths and legends into the storytelling, thus losing the authenticity of history.
　　5. Teaching historical lessons in a dogmatic way. Not combining it with historical facts, only abstractly talking about the nature of society, the stages of social development, etc., neglecting historical eras and figures.
　　6. Unclear about historical units, teaching each lesson in isolation, neglecting the continuity of history.
　　7. Adopting the method of teaching Chinese language when teaching history, writing paragraph summaries, new words, new characters for each paragraph, and requiring memorization.
　　8. Language problems: Some teachers use idioms excessively in class, such as "passively endure," "run out of ammunition and food," etc., which students cannot understand.
　　This history observation teaching is led by the central elementary school and the suburban culture and education section, and will be carried out in a planned and focused manner. It will not be held universally so as not to hinder the progress of the curriculum. Both demonstration teaching and observation are based on the principle of voluntary participation. Demonstration teachers should prepare their own teaching outlines and reference materials, breaking the past pattern of standardized lesson plans. After the demonstration teaching, serious and careful criticism and self-criticism should be conducted, and a good summary should be made. The summary should include the work situation, gains, and lessons learned.

### 克服现存缺点提高教学效果　小学教员将观摩历史教学

　　克服现存缺点提高教学效果
　　小学教员将观摩历史教学
    【京市新闻处讯】京市文教局根据目前各小学历史教学中存在着的一些问题，决定举行一次小学历史观摩教学，以改进教学方法，提高教学效果。该局已于十六日召开会议，统一布置了此项工作。
    据平时的了解，京市小学历史教学存在有如下一些缺点：
    一、观点错误，对于谁是历史的主人，谁是历史的罪人；谁革命，谁反革命等问题，认识模糊。例如把唐太宗说成“唐朝人民政府的领袖”，说“曾国藩是有能有为有办法的大好人”等。
    二、教学目的不明确，教员抓不住课文的重点，把与课文有关的参考材料尽量抄下来，不知适当地取舍，缺乏分析综合，致使学生头昏眼花，找不着课文的中心。
    三、对历史事实不熟悉，对有些问题，含含糊糊地就过去了，讲不透彻。例如说苏联对中国的帮助，只说“苏联一向是帮助中国的”。至于苏联怎样帮助中国？过去怎样？现在怎样？她为什么要帮助中国？以及对苏联的伟大国际主义精神等问题，都未能讲解清楚，或仅是讲一些抽象的概念。
    四、只讲故事，不讲课文，不能使学生得到系统的历史概念；并且有的在讲故事中，掺入神话传奇，致失去历史的真实性。
    五、教条式的讲历史教训。不结合历史事实来讲，只抽象地讲社会性质、社会发展阶段等，忽略了历史年代和人物。
    六、对历史单元不清楚，把每课孤立来讲，忽略了历史的连贯性。
    七、教历史时采用教国语的方式，每段写段落大意、生词、生字、还要背诵。
    八、语言问题：有的教员在讲课时，满口成语，如“逆来顺受”，“弹尽粮绝”等，学童无法了解。
    这次历史观摩教学由中心小学及郊区文教科负责领导，有计划、有重点地开展，不是普遍举行，不妨碍课程的进行。示教与观摩都以自愿参加为原则，示教教员应自己准备教学提纲与参考材料，打破过去千篇一律的教案。示教后，要认真仔细地批评检讨，并很好地作出总结。总结内容应包括工作情况、收获及经验教训等。
