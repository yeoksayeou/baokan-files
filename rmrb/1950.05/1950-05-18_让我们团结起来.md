　　Let Us Unite
　　Lao She

　　At the end of last year, I returned to my hometown of Beijing, which I had been separated from for fourteen years. This excited me. What excited me even more was that in Beijing, I met many old friends from the literary and art circles, and also got to know many new friends. They are all happily working at their posts, and they encourage me, so that I can also happily continue to practice literary writing.

　　However, my friends and I gradually felt that since the liberation of Beijing until today, everyone has not been able to fully exert the power of literature and art to serve the people.

　　It is true that in this ancient capital, we have heard new folk arts and Beijing operas, and also seen new-style New Year pictures and some songs and dances that are in line with the times. But we must also admit that some of those new works are very good in quality, while others are not very good; in quantity, those works are really not enough.

　　Look, the advertisements for entertainment venues in the newspaper are warning us every day that the old folk arts and old dramas still have an overwhelming influence. This phenomenon can easily make some people doubt, are the new works really reliable? Can they really defeat the old entertainment?

　　We cannot but particularly admire the efforts of the artists in the folk art and old drama circles to perform new things through breakthroughs. However, the old things are a vast ocean, and it is certainly not something that can be transformed well in a short period of time by a few people.

　　At the same time, the worker comrades who are working hard to study literature and art cannot get a large amount of spiritual food, nor can they get timely guidance, so that they can create what they want to express.

　　If the above-mentioned phenomenon exists in remote small towns, it is of course not surprising. However, it is a bit wrong for this phenomenon to exist in Beijing. In Beijing's universities and colleges, there are so many professors and students of literature and art; Beijing has so many workers in drama, opera, music, books, and film; Beijing has more than 600 professional folk artists and more than 2,000 old drama actors and stage workers; Beijing also has many famous amateurs and enthusiasts of folk art and old drama. It is a pity that there are so many talents but they cannot do anything.

　　I know that the government's cultural departments and the Party's cultural workers have all made great efforts to lead, organize, and encourage the workers in various art departments and promote the progress of the art cause. However, if this admirable enthusiasm and effort cannot be coordinated with the unity of literary and art workers themselves, the development of the cause will not be comprehensive; and the lack of contact is the current true situation, so the lack of and not very good achievements are also a matter of course.

　　The professors and students of literature and art have not been idle. They have things to do every day. Although they have paid attention to combining with practice in teaching and learning, and strengthened the understanding that literature and art serve the people. However, their activities are ultimately within the school, and it is not easy to have relations with the outside of the school. Therefore, what society needs often cannot be effectively connected with what they are studying, and there is somewhat of a distance. In this way, the activities of literature and art among the people lose a large and powerful team.

　　In fact, apart from the administrative system, those engaged in literature and art in universities and the literary and art workers outside the school are one family. I believe that as long as there is an organization of literary and art workers themselves, Beijing's literary and art cause will be the most outstanding, because the people of Beijing can benefit from the schools and colleges belonging to the central government, and the professors and students of the schools and colleges can also learn more about the situation outside the school, which is very beneficial to learning, research, and creation.

　　Since liberation, the artists of Beijing's folk art and old drama have almost all learned new ideas and increased their sense of responsibility for their work. However, the connection between them and with literary and art workers is not enough, and they are not close enough. Therefore, everyone cannot give full play to their strengths and learn from each other. Some know the skills of opera but cannot write, and some can write but do not understand the skills, which forms an obstacle to the production of new works. Similarly, some can write but do not understand music, and some are good at music but cannot write. Therefore, everyone closes their doors to build cars, and only ends up with hard work and no success; or even because of the failure of writing or performing, they feel depressed and dare not try again; the current shortage of folk art scripts and drama scripts is a clear example.

　　If everyone can unite in one place, and learn and criticize each other at any time, we will surely be able to produce better works, so that they will not be written out of use, or want to write but cannot write. This kind of unity gives everyone a good opportunity to exchange opinions. With this opportunity, everyone will easily increase their knowledge, and also reduce many unnecessary difficulties and troubles. Moreover, with this kind of opportunity, everyone will naturally understand each other's living conditions. The eight-year long-term Japanese aggression and the four years of burning, killing, and looting by the US imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek bandits have left many wounds and disasters to the people; undoubtedly, we also have personal difficulties. In this situation, if we rely solely on the government's love and protection, and do not think of some ideas ourselves to overcome difficulties, then on the one hand, it is inevitable that we will not be able to help, and on the other hand, we will have no skills to use. If we come and go often because of unity, although we may not be able to solve all the difficulties immediately, we will surely be able to solve part of the problems through mutual understanding.

　　Beijing has been a city of culture for many years, a place where there are capable people behind capable people. I believe that if we can unite, we will surely be able to attract more capable people through our efforts and concerted efforts. To give an example: In the past, Beijing's folk art and old drama fans have created or transformed many folk art scripts (especially folk art scripts) and drama scripts for artists. In addition, they may also collect valuable books, facial masks, and music scores; or preserve skills that are about to be lost. However, we do not know them, so we have no chance to get close, and we have buried talents and delayed the full development of literature and art. Our unity is on the one hand to consolidate our position, and on the other hand to open the door to the palace of art, so that those who have a skill can take out their strength and experience.

　　Our current problems in literature and art are closely related to the problems of the people. In terms of political understanding, although we work hard to learn, we are still afraid that we cannot see clearly and accurately. More friends mean more opportunities for discussion, so we must unite. Most of our problems today are multifaceted, not one-sided and isolated. Today, our creation of new poems and improvement of folk art and old drama are all related to music or dance. If we only write, and do not care about singing or dancing, our works will be a three-legged table, which is not stable. We must ask many teachers for advice. If we have great unity, we will find good teachers among our good friends.

　　Our unity itself is a sublime inspiration, and our mutual assistance is the power of literary production. Writers and artists are rich in emotions, and personal emotions will generate more intense firepower because of unity. After the liberation of Beijing, we are no longer afraid of the stalking of agents and the censorship of works, as was the case when the Chiang Kai-shek bandits were in power; therefore, we are the happiest. Well, let this happy mood increase because of unity! Let us happily join hands to serve the people! Our ideal is sublime, but if there is no equipment of skills and the inspiration of enthusiasm, I am afraid that it will be flashy and unrealistic, or retreat in the face of difficulties and "throw away the pen to be idle". Let us stand side by side with like-minded people, exchange skills with each other, encourage each other, and then use exquisite skills and fiery emotions to express our great ideals that match the times!

　　Let the literary and art workers of Beijing unite, and continue to unite, and always unite, because unity is strength!

### 让我们团结起来

　　让我们团结起来
　　老舍
    在去年年底，我回到别离了十四年的故乡北京。这使我兴奋。更使我兴奋的是：在北京，我遇见了多少位文学与艺术界的故人，并认识了不少新朋友。他们都高高兴兴的在他们的岗位上工作，并且鼓励我，使我也能快活的继续练习文艺写作。
    可是，朋友们和我都慢慢的感到：从北京解放到今天，大家并没能充分的发挥文学的与艺术的力量，去为人民服务。
    不错，在这古老的都城中，我们已听到新的曲艺、京剧，也看见了新作风的年画和迎时当令的一些歌舞。可是我们也得承认：那些新的作品，在质上，有的很不错，有的并不很好；在量上，那些作品还实在是不够用的。
    看吧，报纸上游艺场所的广告，天天在那里警告我们：旧的曲艺与旧剧还有压倒的势力。这现象很容易教一些人们怀疑，新作品到底靠得住吗？它们到底能不能战胜老玩艺儿呢？
    我们不能不特别钦佩曲艺界与旧剧界艺人们的努力，把新的东西突围而出的表演出来。可是，旧的东西是汪洋大海，一定不是短期间与几个人能够把它改造得好的。
    同时，努力学习文艺与艺术的工人同志们，既得不到大量的精神食粮，又得不到及时的指导，使他们能作出他们自己所要表现出的东西来。
    假若上述的现象是存在于僻远的小城镇，当然不足为奇。可是，这现象竟在北京存在着，便有些不大对了。北京的各大学与学院里，有那么多位文学与艺术的教授与学生；北京有那么多的话剧、歌剧、音乐、图书、电影工作者；北京有六百多位曲艺的职业艺人，和二千多旧剧的演员与场面工作者；北京还有许多曲艺的和旧剧的名票与爱好者。有这么多的人才，而干不出活儿来，未免太可惜了。
    我知道，政府的有关文化的各机关，与党的文化工作者，已都尽了很大的努力，去领导、组织并鼓励艺术各部门的工作者，推动艺术事业向前进。可是，这值得钦佩的热诚与努力，若不能和艺术文学工作者自己的团结相配合，事业的发展便不会成为全面的；而联系不够，正是目前的真情实况，于是成绩的不多与不十分好，也是理之当然。
    文学与艺术的教授和学生们并没有偷闲，他们每天都有他们该作的事，虽然在教与学上已注意到与实际结合，加强了文艺是为人民服务的认识。可是，他们的活动究竟是在学校里边，不易与校外发生关系。于是，社会上所需要的往往与他们所研讨的不能切实联系，多少有个距离。这样，文学与艺术的在民间的活动便失去了一大队有力的人马。
    其实，抛开行政系统不谈，在大学里搞文学与艺术的和在校外的文学与艺术工作者正是一家人。我相信，只要有了文学与艺术工作者的自己的团体，北京的文学与艺术事业必能作得最出色，因为北京人民可以沾些隶属于中央的各学校学院的光，而学校学院的教授与学生也可以因此而多知道一些校外的情形，对学习，研究，创作，是大有益处的。
    北京的曲艺与旧剧的艺人们，从解放后，差不多都学习了新思想，增高了对业务的责任心。可是，他们彼此之间的，和他们与文学艺术工作者的联系，还不很够，还欠亲密。因此，大家就不能各尽所长，相互切磋。有的知道戏曲的技巧而不会写，有的会写而不懂技巧，这便形成了产生新作品的一种障碍。同样的，有的会写而不懂音乐，有的擅长音乐而不会写。于是，大家各自闭门造车，只落个劳而无功；或且因写作或演出的失败而情绪低落，不敢再去尝试；目前的曲本荒剧本荒就是个显明的例证。
    假若大家能团结在一处，随时的互相讨教与批评，我们就必能产生更好的作品，不至于写出来不合用，或有心无力的要写而写不出来。这种团结给大家以交换意见的好机会。有了这机会，大家便不费力的增多了知识，也就减去了许多不必要的困难与麻烦。而且，常有这种机会，大家就不期然而然的明白些彼此的生活状况。八年长期的日本侵略，四年的美帝蒋匪的烧杀抢掠，给人民留下多少创伤灾难；无疑的，我们也都有个人的困难。在这个情形下，我们若专靠政府的爱护，而不自己也想些主意，克服困难，则一方面难免爱莫能助，另一方面，也将无技可施，假若我们因团结而常常来往，虽然未必能立竿见影的解决了一切困难，可是必能因互相了解而解决一部分的问题。
    北京在多少年来便是文化之城，是个能人背后有能人的地方。我相信，假若我们能团结起来，就必能因我们的努力齐心而招引来更多的能人。举个实例来说：在过去，北京的曲艺与旧剧的票友们曾经为艺人创造或改造过不少的曲本（特别是曲本）与剧本。此外，他们或者还收藏着有价值的图书，脸谱，乐谱；或者保存着已快失传的技艺。可是，我们与他们素不相识，也就无缘接近，便埋没了人才，耽误了文学艺术的充分发展。我们的团结一方面是巩固我们的阵地，另一方面也是打开艺术之宫的大门，使有一技之长的都拿出他的力量与经验来。
    我们今天的文学上与艺术上的问题是密切的与人民的问题相关。在政治认识上，我们虽努力学习，还怕看不清，看不准。多一个朋友便多一个讨论的机会，所以我们必须团结。我们今天的问题多数是多方面的，而不是片面的和孤立的。我们今天创造新诗，改进曲艺与旧剧，就都与音乐或舞蹈有关。设若我们只管写，而不管唱或舞，我们的作品便是三条腿的桌子，站不牢稳。我们必须去向许多位老师请教。我们若有了大团结，我们就会在益友之中找到了良师。
    我们团结的本身便是崇高的灵感，我们彼此的互助便是文艺生产的力量。文学家和艺术家是富于感情的，个人的感情会因团结而发生更热烈的火力。在北京解放后，我们不再怕特务的钉梢，作品的检查，像在蒋匪当权的时候那样；因此，我们是最愉快的。好吧，教这愉快的心情，因团结而增高吧！让咱们快快活活的携起手来，去为人民服务吧！我们的理想是崇高的，但是若没有技巧的配备与热情的激发，恐怕就要华而不实，或是知难而退，“投笔从闲”了。让我们志同道合的并肩立在一处，彼此交换本领，互相鼓励，而后用精美的技巧，火热的感情，去表现出我们的配合时代的伟大理想吧！
    北京的文学与艺术工作者团结起来吧，而且要继续团结，永远团结，因为团结就是力量！
