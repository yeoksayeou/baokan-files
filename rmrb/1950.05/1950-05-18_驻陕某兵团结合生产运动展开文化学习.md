Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 14th. Units of a certain division of the Shaanxi Military Region of the People's Liberation Army are simultaneously launching cultural learning activities during their intensive production campaign. When formulating production plans, each unit also formulates learning plans. The Second Company of a certain regiment held a symposium for activists in cultural learning, which promoted an upsurge in learning throughout the unit. Soldiers without paper and pens are automatically purchasing them with their allowances. Due to a shortage of textbooks, some units first have the study group leaders copy them out, and then teach them to the entire class of soldiers. To solve the problem of study time, most units adopt a "rotational shift system," that is, the production personnel are divided into two groups, one group reclaims wasteland, and the other group studies at the edge of the field, rotating on time. This also overcomes the difficulty of a shortage of tools. Some units use rest time for classes. In addition, a "little teacher" system is implemented, with each class divided into two or three mutual-aid learning groups, and each platoon has a "little teacher." When the soldiers are resting, they all go to the literacy boards to be taught words and read lessons by the "little teachers." Some units place literacy boards in the shade of large trees in the production area, or paste the names and new words of various tools on them, so that everyone can learn anytime, anywhere. The First Battalion of a certain regiment established a mobile library under the shade of a large tree in the production area, displaying company wall newspapers, various newspapers, songbooks, literacy textbooks, etc. Soldiers all rush to read them during rest periods.

　　驻陕某兵团结合生产运动展开文化学习
    【新华社西安十四日电】人民解放军陕西军区某部各单位在紧张的大生产中，同时展开文化学习。各单位在订生产计划的时候，都同时订学习计划。某团二连召开了学习文化的积极分子座谈会，推动整个学习热潮。没有纸笔的战士，都自动用津贴费购买。由于课本不够，有些部队先由学习组长抄写，然后再教全班战士。为了解决学习时间，大多数采取“轮流换班制”，即把生产人员分为两组，一组开荒，另一组在地边学习，按时替换。这样也可以克服工具缺少的困难。有的利用休息时间上课。另外，还实行小先生制，每班分成两三个学习互助小组，每排设一小先生。当战士们休息时，就都到识字牌前由小先生教字念课。有的把识字牌插在地头上，或在各种工具上贴着它们的名字和生字，让大家随时随地学习。某团一营在生产地区的大树荫下，建立流动图书馆，把连队墙报、各种报纸、歌本、识字课本等陈列起来，战士们一到休息时间都跑去阅读。
