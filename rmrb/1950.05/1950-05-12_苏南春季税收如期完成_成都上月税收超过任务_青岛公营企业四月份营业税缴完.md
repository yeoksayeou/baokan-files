    【新华社上海八日电】苏南区春季税收任务已如期超额完成。计实收税款折合大米一亿零八百五十六万三千九百三十九斤，超过原定任务百分之二点九。该区在征收过程中，许多市、县税务局都曾有计划地调训干部，对工作上“不调查，不研究”的官僚主义作风及某些干部的贪污腐化思想，展开了批评与检讨，同时对业务认真的干部提出表扬，启发了工作人员的积极性。因此得到如期超额完成任务的成绩。
    【新华社成都十一日电】成都市四月份税收任务已超额完成。计实收税款七十一亿三千余万元，超过原定任务六十亿元的百分之十八点八。成都市税务局在征收工作中，由于掌握具体情况，主动整顿和开辟了税源，积极查征、催收，并将政策宣传和处罚漏税结合进行，因此超额完成了任务。
    【新华社青岛九日电】青岛市公营企业四月份营业税已于本月六日全部缴纳完毕。全市应缴四月份公营企业营业税的单位共四十二户，经税局按照不同税率核定税额共七十八亿零二百二十余万元，折合小米七百四十一万九千余斤。
