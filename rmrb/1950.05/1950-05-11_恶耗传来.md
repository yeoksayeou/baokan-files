    "Agnes Smedley is dead!"
    Is it true? I almost can't believe it, because I knew in Prague and Moscow that she was living well, that she was still there writing books about China; I always thought I would see her in China soon, because she wanted to return to China, she wanted to find a way to return to China. But it's true, it's absolutely true, I have no doubt, because the American government hates her, they don't want her to live well, they hate her for doing just propaganda in America, they guard against her, oppress her, frame her; because she is a friend of the Chinese people, she opposes Chiang Kai-shek, she supports world peace, she opposes the imperialists and warmongers of her own country! I am silenced by this sudden news, losing a friend, losing a truly righteous fighter, my painful heart gnawing at my anger. But I also roar with this sudden news! You, you man-eating beasts, you gang of brutal bandits. You play with war, despise human rights, you are the public enemy of mankind, you are approaching your end. We will fight to eliminate this kind of aggressor. Today, our world's peaceful and democratic forces are also confident in completely eliminating all fascists from the earth!
    My initial impression of Agnes Smedley in Shanghai was that of a person with a passion for the Chinese revolution. Every time she received news from Jiangxi, from the Soviet areas, or information about workers' struggles in the cities, farmers' struggles in the countryside, she was so happy that she couldn't sleep, often going to the post office late at night to pick up letters or send manuscripts. At the same time, dark and bloody news such as the capture of revolutionaries, the shooting of revolutionaries, often troubled her and damaged her health. But no matter how much the police were paying attention to her, she was still bravely sending manuscripts abroad, publicizing the victory of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army and the darkness of the Kuomintang rule. The "China's Red Army Marches" she wrote during this period had a great impact internationally.
    She lived a very hard life in Yan'an, but she worked very hard. In addition to writing news articles, she also collected materials on Red Army generals. I felt that she had an indescribable love for these generals of ours. She was often moved to tears by their achievements, their bravery and wisdom, and their steadfast, people-oriented, great and noble qualities. She felt that there was nothing more meaningful to do than to use her pen to sing their praises, so she began writing a biography of Zhu De and some other short stories. She not only treated our generals well, but she also often treated those little red devils (the youngsters in the Red Army - editor) with a mother's eyes. When her orderly was sick, she did her best to be an excellent nurse.
    In 1938, when we were on the front lines in Shanxi, she was also a reporter in the General Headquarters. She marched like everyone else, ate like everyone else, she never complained of fatigue, and she still wrote manuscripts at night. She was happy as could be, like she was in her closest family. I know that she cried several times when she left the front lines to go to the rear. She told me that she really didn't want to leave the Eighth Route Army.
    Although I haven't seen her since then, I know that she was doing propaganda work for us in the Kuomintang-controlled rear areas at that time, doing some fundraising work. She was still dedicating her strength to our anti-Japanese cause. I also know that she lived a very difficult life after returning to her country. She was envied by the American government, but she still participated in some forums on Chinese issues, where she spoke out and tried her best to oppose American imperialism's aggression against China and their support for the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek government. Later, she became even more active in the world's peace and democratic movement.
    It was certainly unfavorable to American imperialism for such a person to live in the United States. Therefore, the American government constantly persecuted her, trying to frame her with the charge of being a "Soviet spy." Last November, she was forced into exile in Britain, where she died of illness. Although Agnes Smedley died in England, it was still the American government that forced her to death!
    Agnes Smedley is dead! This is a loss for the American people, because she was an outstanding representative of them; this is also a loss for the Chinese people, because we have lost an American friend who loved China!
    Agnes Smedley's death once again confirms the fascist nature of the American government! This is the so-called American "freedom"! American imperialism's forcing Agnes Smedley to death cannot stop the peace and democratic movement of the American people and the people of the world, it can only inspire more kind people to take action, to protest and fight against our common enemy, the public enemy of the world's people - the American imperialists. Obviously, the victory of the struggle is certain to be on the side of the people of the world. We will use victory to comfort, to comfort Agnes Smedley and all the heroes who sacrificed for justice and peace!

    “史沫特莱死了!”
    这是真的吗？我几乎不敢相信，因为我在布拉格，在莫斯科都知道他还很好的活着，知道她还在那里写中国的书；我总以为不久我会在中国见到她，因为她是想回中国来，她要设法回中国来。但这是真的，是千真万确的，我不会有什么怀疑，因为美国政府是憎恨她的，他们不愿她好好活着，他们讨厌她在美国做正义的宣传，他们防备她，压迫她，陷害她；因为，她是中国人民的朋友，她反对蒋介石，她拥护世界和平，她反对她本国的帝国主义、战争贩子们！我为这骤然的消息，失去了一个朋友，失去了一个真真有正义感的战士而沉默，沉痛的心啃咬着我的愤怒。但我又为这骤然的消息，而怒吼！你，你吃人的野兽，你们这群残暴的匪徒。你们玩弄战争，蔑视人权，你们是人类的公敌，你们已接近末日。我们是要为消灭这种侵略者而斗争下去的。今天我们全世界的和平民主力量也是有信心在地球上彻底消灭一切法西斯主义者的！
    史沫特莱最初在上海给我的印象，就是一个对中国革命具有热情的人。她每得到一个从江西、从苏区来的消息，或是城市里的工人斗争、农村里的农民斗争等情况时，就高兴得不能睡觉，常常深夜还到邮局去取信或者发稿。同时，那些捕捉革命者、枪杀革命者等等黑暗的血腥的消息，也常常苦恼她，损害她的健康。但她不管怎样被巡捕房所注意，也仍然是勇敢地向外国发稿，宣传中国工农红军的胜利和国民党统治的黑暗。她在这个时期所写的“红色的中国”在国际上是有很大影响的。
    她在延安，生活过得很刻苦，而工作却十分努力。她除了写通讯稿以外，还搜集红军将领的材料。我觉得她对我们这些将领都是说不出来的那样爱戴。她为他们的功绩、为他们的勇敢与智慧、为他们那种坚贞为人民的伟大的崇高的品质，常常感动得流泪。她觉得没有别的更有意义的事可做，只有用她的笔来歌颂他们，她着手写了朱德传和一些别的短篇。她不只是对我们的将领，她就是对那些小红鬼（红军中的少年们——编者）也常常用一种母亲的眼光来对待他们。她的勤务员生病时，她完全做到是一个极好的护士。
    一九三八年我们在山西前线时，她也在总司令部当记者。她同大家一样行军、一样吃饭，她从来不喊疲倦，晚上还写稿子。她快乐得什么似的，就像在她的最亲密的家庭里。我知道当她离开前线到后方去时，她哭过好几次。她同我说，她实在不愿离开八路军。
    这以后我虽然没有再见着她，但我知道她在那时国民党统治的大后方替我们做宣传工作，做些募捐工作。她是把她的力量仍然为我们的抗日事业而奋斗的。我也知道她回国后生活很困苦。她被美国政府所嫉视，但是她还是参加一些中国问题座谈会，她在会上发言，尽力反对美国帝国主义对中国的侵略，反对他们支持反动的蒋介石政府。后来就更为世界的和平民主运动而活动。
    这样的人在美国住下去对美帝国主义当然是不利的。美国政府因此不断迫害，她想用“苏联间谍”的罪名陷害她。去年十一月，她被迫流亡英国，直到病死。史沫特莱虽然是死在英国，而逼死她的，仍然是美国的政府！
    史沫特莱死了！这是美国人民的损失，因为她是他们中一个优秀的代表；这也是中国人民的损失，因为我们失去了一个热爱中国的美国友人！
    史沫特莱的死，又一次证实美国政府的法西斯性质！这就是所谓美国式的“自由”！美帝国主义逼死了史沫特莱，不能阻止美国人民与全世界人民的和平民主运动，只能激起更多善良的人们行动起来，向我们共同的敌人，向世界人民的公敌——美帝国主义者抗议与斗争。很显然，斗争的胜利是一定在世界人民方面。我们将会拿胜利来安慰，来安慰史沫特莱及一切为正义、为和平而牺牲了的英雄们！
