　　When I attended the Third Meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace in Stockholm this March, an American representative showed me a letter Smedley had written to him. Enclosed in the envelope were several pages of densely written words, the content of which was various materials she had collected from foreign and Chinese newspapers regarding the bombing of Shanghai and major Chinese cities by American planes, proving that the bombing of Shanghai and other places was entirely carried out by American planes, American bombs, and American and Japanese pilots. In the letter, she asked the American representative to read this document at the conference, but instructed him not to reveal her name… Although, due to time constraints, her document was not read at the meeting, it was handed over to the Standing Committee as an “archive” for preservation, or for publication in periodicals.
    From this incident, we can see that Smedley never forgot the Chinese revolution and the Chinese people, and always stood on the side of the democratic peace camp. At the same time, we can also see how much the American imperialist aggressor war instigators hated and oppressed her.
    Is there any doubt that Smedley was forced to death by American imperialism? The heads of the aggressive war group, the handful of financial and military magnates in the United States, are today establishing military bases all over the world, organizing war groups, and preparing for war frantically. They are doing their utmost to incite and cultivate a war mentality, war mania, and war hysteria domestically. Naturally, they cannot tolerate righteous people with a sense of justice in their own country speaking out and acting, so they oppress the progressive writer Fast, oppress the progressive singer Robeson, and also oppress the progressive writer and journalist Agnes Smedley.
    However, despite the increasing fascism in the United States, the American people will certainly join with peace-loving people all over the world to actively act and strive to defend world peace by opposing the heinous atomic weapons. The declaration issued by the Stockholm Conference, “Absolutely prohibit atomic weapons, whoever uses atomic weapons first is a war criminal,” is the angry roar and stern warning of half of humanity on earth against warmongers. This roar, issued from the mouths of the great Soviet people, from the mouths of the great Chinese people for whom Smedley did a lot, from the mouths of the people of various democratic countries, and from the mouths of the awakened people of all countries in the capitalist world, will heavily strike the aggressors.
    All good people, take action!

### 哀悼史沫特莱—中国人民之友

　　哀悼史沫特莱—中国人民之友
　　萧三
    今年三月去斯德哥尔摩出席世界拥护和平大会常设委员会第三次会议时，一位美国代表，拿出史沫特莱写给他的信给我看，信封里附了几页密密的字，内容是她从外国和中国的报纸所搜集的关于美机轰炸上海及中国各大城市的各种材料，证明对上海等地的轰炸，完全是美国的飞机，美国的炸弹，美国的和日本的飞行员干的。信中要那位美国代表在大会上宣读这个文件，但叮嘱说，不要说出她的姓名……虽然因为时间的关系，她那文件没有在会议时宣读，但交给了和大常设委员会，作为“档案”保存，或在刊物上发表。
    从这一件事，我们看出，史沫特莱始终不忘中国革命与中国人民，始终站在民主和平阵营一方面，同时也看出美帝国主义侵略战争挑拨者对她是如何地嫉恨、压迫的。
    史沫特莱是美帝国主义逼死的，这还有什么疑问吗？侵略战争集团的头子，美国少数的财阀军阀，今天正在地球各处建立军事基地，组织战争集团，疯狂地备战，在国内极力煽动，培养一种战争心理，战争狂，战争的歇斯迭里，自然不容本国民主进步有正义感的人士说话和活动，于是压迫进步的作家法斯特，压迫进步的歌手罗伯逊，也压迫进步的作家与记者史沫特莱。
    但是，尽管美国统治日益法西斯化，美国的人民一定会和全世界爱好和平的人民在一道，为反对罪恶的原子武器，为保卫世界和平而积极行动，努力奋斗下去的。斯德哥尔摩会议发出的“绝对禁止原子武器，谁首先使用原子武器谁就是战犯”的宣言，就是全地球上一半人类对战争贩子愤怒的吼声，严厉的警告。这个怒吼，从伟大的苏联人民口中发出，从伟大的、史沫特莱为他作了不少事的中国人民口中发出，从各个民主国家人民的口中，从资本主义世界各国的觉悟的人民口中发出，是能重重地打击侵略者的。
    一切善良的人们，行动起来吧！
