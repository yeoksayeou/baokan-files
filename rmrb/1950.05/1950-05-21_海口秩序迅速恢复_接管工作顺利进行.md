　　Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, 19th -- Since the liberation of Haikou City, the capital of Hainan, normal order has been gradually restored under the correct leadership of the local Military Control Commission and with the active assistance of people from all walks of life. Due to the rapid advance of our army, public buildings in the city did not suffer significant damage from the enemy. Shops and markets... resumed normal business the day after liberation. The power plant, under the supervision of the workers, never stopped supplying electricity, and on the evening of April 23, the day of liberation, even extended the supply time until midnight. Personnel from the original Kuomintang government agencies, factories, schools, hospitals, etc., also remained at their posts, quietly awaiting the takeover. In the half-month since the establishment of the Military Control Commission on May 1st, a total of fifty units including government agencies, factories, schools, and hospitals have been taken over. The archives and equipment of the taken-over units are mostly intact. The workers of the Hainan Textile Factory spontaneously organized before the fleeing bandits, using cloth to barricade the main gate and using wooden sticks and stones as weapons, taking turns on guard day and night. When the People's Liberation Army arrived at 9 a.m. on the 23rd, the workers immediately opened the gate to welcome them, and everyone shouted slogans such as "Long Live Chairman Mao!" "Long Live the People's Liberation Army!" "Long Live Democracy!" The employees of the Haikou City Power Plant and the Second District Highway Bureau Automobile Repair Factory completely preserved more than 2,000 types of generators and automotive engineering equipment newly shipped from Taiwan. Currently, the city's transportation, postal, and telecommunications services are also rapidly recovering. Land routes are open to Wanning in the east and Nada in the west. Sea routes have been operating with ships and sailboats to Zhanjiang since the 5th. The Telecommunications Bureau has also resumed communications with Zhanjiang, Beihai, Guangzhou, and other places.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Qiongya, 20th -- The People's Liberation Army Haikou City Garrison is actively carrying out the work of consolidating public security in the urban area. Revolutionary order in Haikou has been initially established. As of May 10th, a total of 6,233 scattered soldiers and stragglers of the Kuomintang bandit army have been taken in. In addition, 210 wounded soldiers abandoned by the bandit army during their retreat have also been taken in and treated by the People's Liberation Army. At the same time, the garrison troops, while clearing out hidden bandits in the city, have successively uncovered forty-eight officers above the rank of colonel, including Han Chao, lieutenant general and deputy commander of the bandit's 62nd Army, and Hu Zujie, major general and deputy commander of the bandit's "Guangdong Anti-Communist National Salvation Army."
