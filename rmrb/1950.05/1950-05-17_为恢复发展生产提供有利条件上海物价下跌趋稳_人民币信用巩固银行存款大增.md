　　Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 14th: Over the past two months, under the powerful measures taken by the People's Government to unify national financial and economic work, Shanghai's prices have gradually declined and tended towards stabilization. Some abnormal phenomena in the price parity of industrial and agricultural products, which arose during the process of price decline and stabilization, have begun to return to normal since May after the active adjustment by national trade organizations. The people of all social strata have begun to gradually consolidate their trust in the RMB, and bank currency deposits have increased significantly.

　　According to statistics compiled by the Economic Research Department of the East China Branch of the People's Bank of China, the general index of wholesale prices of 23 basic commodities in Shanghai was 25360 at the end of February (with January to June 1937 equaling 1 as the base), falling to 23853 at the end of March, a decrease of 5.9 percent. At the end of April, it fell another 15.6 percent compared to the end of March, and 20.7 percent compared to the end of February. In terms of exchange rates, from the first week of April, the discount phenomenon in commercial banks and firms gradually disappeared, and there was a tendency to align with the People's Bank of China. Foreign exchange also began to decline across the board at the same time. Taking the US dollar as an example, it fell from 41,000 yuan on April 3 to 37,000 yuan on April 29. This situation marks that the national financial and economic situation has indeed begun to improve, initially relieving the suffering caused by inflation to the people of Shanghai, especially the working people, for the past twelve years, and is gradually creating favorable conditions for the restoration and development of industrial and commercial production.

　　Among the price declines of various major commodities, cotton yarn fell the most. Comparing April 20 with March 6, 20-count Jincheng yarn fell by 50 percent, and large machine cotton also fell by 28.6 percent. Food rice fell less, with medium white japonica rice only falling by 7.4 percent. The disparity in the magnitude of the decline has caused changes in the normal proportions between the prices of certain commodities. Taking the ratio of yarn to rice as an example, the amount of rice exchanged for cotton yarn decreased, and the price of grain was relatively high. This situation is not conducive to the restoration of normal production and exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, and the normal development of legitimate industry and commerce. In order to take care of production, Shanghai trade organizations began to purchase some industrial finished products from manufacturers from April 22 based on the overall market situation. As of May 6, they had purchased 159,830 bolts of cotton cloth and 1,381 pieces of cotton yarn, actively curbing the excessive decline in the price of yarn and cloth. For example, 20-count Jincheng yarn fell all the way from 6.95 million yuan at the end of February to 4.3 million yuan on April 22. After being purchased by trade organizations, it stopped falling and rose back to 5 million yuan by the end of April. Trade organizations also adjusted rice prices twice, smoothing the price of medium white japonica rice from 250,000 yuan per dan to 240,000 yuan, gradually making the price ratio between industrial and agricultural products more reasonable. As a result of these measures taken by the People's Government, from the last week of April, commodities such as cotton yarn, cotton, and edible oil rose slightly, finally turning the price trend from a straight decline to stability. The trading volume in the wholesale market continued to increase, providing favorable conditions for future restoration and development of production.

　　Financial markets have also gradually normalized in the past two months.

　　Along with the gradual stabilization of prices, financial markets have also gradually normalized in the past two months. Deposits in public and private banks and firms have increased daily, interest rates have generally decreased by more than four-fifths, and underground interest has disappeared. The total balance of private deposits in public and private banks and firms was 672.6 billion yuan at the end of February. By the end of March, after deducting part of the deposit withdrawn by various industries due to the payment of public debt, the balance still reached 692.4 billion yuan. At the end of April, it increased by 20 percent compared to the end of March, with the balance increasing to 831.5 billion yuan. In terms of private deposits, real value savings decreased by 52.2 percent at the end of March compared to the end of February, and decreased by another 63 percent at the end of April compared to the end of March. Conversely, currency savings increased by 67.9 percent at the end of March compared to the end of February, and increased by another 79.4 percent at the end of April compared to the end of March. Moreover, the term of private deposits has gradually changed from short-term to long-term. The Shanghai Municipal Financial Interest Rate Committee recently abolished the three-day fixed-term interest rate listing and added a one-month fixed-term interest rate listing. The People's Bank of China recently accepted dozens of fixed deposits with a term of more than one year at the request of customers, with an amount of 200 million yuan.

　　Qingdao's price stability benefits the people.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 14th: The vast majority of people in Qingdao have generally benefited from stable prices. In early May, a bag of flour costing 61,000 yuan and a bolt of Shuanglong fine cloth costing 235,000 yuan were on average 14.5 percent lower than in early March. Workers and public employees who rely on wages to maintain their lives used to hope to receive goods in kind when prices fluctuated, but now they generally hope to receive RMB. Ma Yong, a female teacher, can now make a more adequate distribution of her monthly salary: in addition to supplying the daily needs of her family of four, she can also allocate some money to send to her husband who is studying in Beijing. Li Shiliang, a worker in the railway inspection section, said: "Now that life is stable, I feel happy and I work especially hard!" Miao Zichun, a peddler, said: "With stable prices, business is easy to do. Last year, who would dare to leave money at home overnight! Once, I bought cigarettes for 5,600 yuan and sold them for 6,520 yuan. I hurried to replenish the stock, but it had jumped to 8,000 yuan! Now I'm not afraid. It won't change in a few days. I earn what I can. I used to make 20% profit in business, but I still couldn't guarantee I wouldn't lose money. Now, even 10% profit is enough to support my family." The Qingdao Railway Employees Cooperative sold flour for 22,500 yuan when it paid salaries in February, but it cost 60,000 yuan to replenish it, losing more than 200 million yuan. Now it can replenish the original goods at the selling price, which is of great benefit to the development of the cooperative's employee welfare work. Zhao Meizhai, the owner of Zhengtai Iron Factory, who used to give a 30% profit when shipping goods and still lose his wages and food expenses when buying back raw materials, said: "Business is easier to do after prices stabilize. Not only will I not lose money in price fluctuations, but I can also rest assured to give credit for three to five days in transactions." Mingxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory, which barely maintained production during the period of price fluctuations, has recently added a Nafuto dyeing machine.

　　为恢复发展生产提供有利条件上海物价下跌趋稳
　　人民币信用巩固银行存款大增
    【新华社上海十四日电】两个月来上海物价在人民政府采取有力的统一国家财经工作的措施下，逐步下跌，趋向稳定；在物价下跌趋稳过程中产生的工农业产品比价的某些不正常的现象，经国家贸易机构主动调整后，五月份以来亦已开始趋向正常。各阶层人民对于人民币的信任开始逐步巩固，银行货币存款大增。
    据中国人民银行华东区行经济研究处所编统计，上海二十三种基本商品趸售价格总指数二月底为二五三六○（以一九三七年一月至六月等于一为基准），三月底降至二三八五三，下跌百分之五点九，四月底又比三月底下跌百分之一五点六，比二月底则跌了百分之二○点七。汇率方面，四月份第一周起，商业行庄的贴水现象已渐消除，并有向人民银行看齐的趋势；外汇也同时开始全面降低，以美汇为例，由四月三日的四万一千元，降至四月二十九日的三万七千元。这一情况，标志着全国财经情况确已开始好转，初步解除了上海人民特别是劳动人民十二年来由于通货膨胀所造成的痛苦，对工商业生产的恢复与发展也正在逐步创造出有利条件。
    在各种主要商品价格下降过程中，以棉纱跌落最多。以四月二十日与三月六日作比较，二十支金城纱降落百分之五十，大机棉花亦降落百分之二十八点六。食米跌落较少，中白粳只下降百分之七点四。下降幅度的参差使得某些商品价格间的正常比例发生变化。如以纱、米的比价为例，棉纱换米数量减少，粮食价格偏高。这种情况，不利于生产和城乡物资交流的恢复正常和正当工商业的正常开展。上海贸易机构为照顾生产，自四月二十二日起即根据整个市场情况，收购部分厂商工业成品。至五月六日止，收购棉布达十五万九千八百三十匹，棉纱一千三百八十一件，主动地制止纱布价格的过分下跌。如二十支金城纱由二月底的六百九十五万元一路跌到四月二十二日的四百三十万元，经贸易机构收购后，四月底止跌回涨至五百万元。贸易机构并曾两度调整米价，将中白粳米自每石二十五万平抑至二十四万元，有步骤地使工农业品间的比价趋向合理。由于人民政府采取了这些措施，四月份最后一周起，棉纱、棉花、食油等商品微升，终于使物价由直线下跌的趋势转入了平稳，批发市场的交易量续见增加，为今后恢复和发展生产提供了有利条件。
            两月来金融市场也逐渐趋向正常
    与物价逐步稳定同时，两个月来金融市场也逐渐趋向正常，公私行庄存款日见增加，利率一般已降低了五分之四以上，而暗息更已消声匿迹。公私营行庄二月底私人存款总余额为六千七百二十六亿元，至三月底止除去各业因缴公债款额提存一部外，余额犹达六千九百二十四亿元，四月底则比三月底增加百分之二十，余额增至八千三百一十五亿元。私人存款方面，折实储蓄三月底较二月底减少百分之五十二点二，四月底又较三月底减少百分之六十三；相反地，货币储蓄三月底较二月底增加百分之六十七点九，四月底又较三月底增加百分之七十九点四，且私人存款的期限也逐渐由短期转为长期。上海市金融利率委员会最近又废除了三天定期的利率牌价，并增挂一个月的定期利率牌价；人民银行最近应客户要求收存了一年以上的定存数十起，款额达两亿元。
            青岛物价稳定  人民普遍受益
    【新华社青岛十四日电】青岛市绝大多数人民普遍受到物价平稳的利益。五月初每袋六万一千元的面粉和二十三万五千元一匹的双龙细布，比三月初平均下跌百分之十四点五。依靠薪资维持生活的工人以及公教人员，过去当物价波动时，都希望发实物，现在则普遍希望发人民币。女教员马庸现在每月所得薪水可作较充裕的分配：除供应全家四口日需外，还可调匀出一些钱寄给她在北京学习的丈夫。铁路检车段工人李世良说：“现在生活安定了，心里痛快，干活也特别上劲！”小贩苗子春说：“物价稳定，买卖都好做。去年谁还敢把钱放在家里过宿！有一次，我以五千六百元买的烟卷，回来便卖六千五百二十元，我赶紧补货，但已跳到了八千元！现在不怕了，隔几天也不会变样，挣一个是一个。我以前做买卖要打二分利，还保不住不蚀本，现在只要一分利，就够养家了。”青岛铁路员工合作社二月份发薪时以二万二千五百元卖出的面粉，以六万元才补进来，赔了二亿余元；现在则可以按卖出价补回原货，这样就大为有利于该社职工福利工作的开展。往年出货常打三分利、还连工资和饭钱都赔上才买回原料来的正泰铁工厂主赵美斋说：“物价稳定后买卖好做了，不用说不会在物价波动中赔本，就是交易往来，赊个三天五日也放心。”在物价波动时期勉强维持生产的明新染织厂最近正添装纳富妥印染机一部。
