　　Review of Pearl Buck's Recent Work "Kinfolk"
    (Translated by Xiao Mei from "New Times," Issue 11, Moscow Air Edition, March 15th. Reprinted from Shanghai Ta Kung Pao, April 17th)

    Pearl Buck recently (published in New York in 1949 – translator) wrote a novel with the theme of the new China, titled "Kinfolk," which has attracted considerable attention. In this book, the author, as a "China expert," attempts to talk about the political, moral, and psychological aspects of today's China, relying on her profound knowledge of Chinese customs and practices. The theme of the story is about modern Chinese patriotic youth and how they serve their country.

    The author was originally the daughter of a missionary and herself engaged in missionary work, having lived in China for many years. There is no doubt that she has writing talent. Her writings about Chinese life, especially her portrayal of Chinese peasants, such as "The Good Earth," "Sons," and "A House Divided" published before the war, were once very popular. There were also translations in the Soviet Union, and they sold very well.

    However, Pearl Buck's works always give people a noticeable flaw, which is her extreme attempt to avoid discussing the epoch-making political and social revolution of modern China. Pearl Buck has never been a person with progressive ideas. Her literary talent and ability to observe things sometimes corrected some of her prejudices, and at the same time, the truth of life overcame her political errors. Therefore, despite her unfamiliarity with the progressive forces in Chinese society, her works, especially her early ones, still had a significant impact. She exposed the poverty of Chinese peasants, their longing for land, the heavy exploitation they suffered, and the devastation of inhuman warlords. On this point, the author vividly portrayed the kind and hardworking character of Chinese peasants, the most beautiful character of the Chinese people manifested in these peasants. Against the background of residual feudal evils, bandit-like warlords, and greedy comprador bourgeoisie, they were even more prominent.

    But even in her early works, the Chinese reality written by Pearl Buck was only one-sided. Precisely because she did not let readers know about Chinese political life and class struggle, her books could have helped readers understand the reasons for the Chinese people's revolution, but this was not in line with her original intention. She simply did not want to understand the revolutionary process taking place in China. She refused to talk about the development of the vast revolutionary movement in China. She refused to understand the obstacles to the Chinese revolution. Pearl Buck did not stand on the side of the Chinese people in the great war of liberation of the Chinese people.

    Despite all the hard work she put into studying Chinese customs, traditions, and even the psychology of the Chinese people, she completely ignored the political life and aspirations of the Chinese people. This is precisely her political contribution to the American imperialist capitalists who conquered China.

    When the entire China was burning in the flames of the struggle for liberation, and thousands of people were bravely and arduously fighting to the death with the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the imperialists, when the new China was building new social relations under the leadership of the Communist Party, the characters in Pearl Buck's writings were like living in a vacuum tube, completely unaware of all these realities.

    Naturally, sometimes Pearl Buck could not avoid the word "Communist Party" - the importance of the Communist Party in China has become a problem in the eyes of American "China experts." But her only solution to this problem is to imitate the propaganda of American imperialism and spread shameless and absurd slanders. Even today, she still firmly adheres to this position.

    In her political opinions and the international articles she has written, Pearl Buck has always worn the glasses of aggressive American imperialism. Even today, she still dreams that as long as "American aid" is abundant enough, history can still be reversed, and the old China can be revived from the dead.

    Readers will not find an "imperialist" in Pearl Buck's books. Occasionally, one or two foreigners appear in her books, all of whom are generous, kind, and compassionate doctors and pastors. With her pen, she wants to support Chinese feudalism and praise the stagnant and backward patriarchal lifestyle.

    Her new book, "Kinfolk," was written at the height of the victory of the Chinese People's Liberation War, but Pearl Buck still clings to her self-deceiving fantasies, trying to build herself into a thick wall, isolated from all politics and the transformation of Chinese society. By going against reality in this way, she sought and found utter failure. All her literary talent is not enough to save her. Whether as an artist or a China expert, Pearl Buck's new book has been branded with the fire-lacquer seal of bankruptcy.

    "Kinfolk" is set in the present, against the background of New York, Beijing, and remote rural areas in Central China. The main characters: some Chinese intellectuals and bourgeoisie who live in the United States and have accepted the American way of life. Pearl Buck is extremely competent in writing about this atmosphere. She paints a vivid portrait of this group of Chinese bourgeois intellectuals who depend on American benevolence for their survival, a group of unprincipled people who have abandoned their motherland and people. She describes the upstarts who made their fortunes through arms contracts, deposited their money in American banks, and then fled China after the Kuomintang collapsed, like the Li and Zhang couples, and the Dings, and their completely Americanized young men and women, indulging in extravagance and licentious lives in New York.

    This book writes about the spiritual poverty, the lack of national thought of the youth, spoiled and degenerate, deeply poisoned by Americanism, forgetting the language of the motherland. But it is destined that their noble origins, their wealthy families, and even their European airs cannot allow them to gain a foothold in a foreign country. In the eyes of the bourgeois in America, who are full of racial discrimination, a Chinese person, no matter how high their education, even a rich and beautiful girl, is still an animal inferior to white people.

    "Kinfolk" tells the story of the Liang family, who have been Americanized. The father, Dr. Liang, is a professor of Chinese literature in New York, deeply studying Confucian books, proficient in poetry, songs, and fu, and deeply loved by some eccentric American ladies. Dr. Liang, who is thoroughly reactionary, is a complete and utter hypocrite. He lives in the United States because it is lucrative and comfortable there. He emphasizes "Chinese etiquette," but his respect for Chinese culture is limited to appearances.

    The hypocrisy and triviality in the heart of this Americanized Confucian is vividly expressed through his relationship with his wife. The wife of the elegant professor is a simple rural woman. Their marriage was arranged by their parents. Pearl Buck herself seems to have a great interest in this type of marriage, although contemporary Chinese youth advocate free marriage. In ancient China, a wife had no voice and did not become an independent personality. Mrs. Liang is her husband's obedient servant. In Professor Liang's mind, women, children, and fools are all the same. Apart from obeying her husband, observing family rules, and being indifferent to social affairs, Mrs. Liang still retains her personality. Readers still like this ordinary woman who is ignorant, illiterate, but has a good heart. She has common sense and no moral stain. Mrs. Liang is completely opposite to Professor Liang. Professor Liang does not know the motherland, everything starts from himself, and he is numb; but she misses the small village in her hometown. No matter how long she lives in the United States, she will always be a foreigner. America is always incomprehensible, even hostile, to her. She stays in New York entirely because of her husband.

    They have four children: sons James and Peter, and daughters Mary and Louise. With a father who has extensive social connections, their future is naturally worry-free. James Liang is studying surgery. Before he graduated, a clinic in New York had already hired him.

    But James has his own plans. He and his sister Mary do not like the cosmopolitan environment around them. They love their motherland and know that it needs talent. They are more willing to return to their motherland when it is most in need. They are not afraid of suffering when they return. Despite the hunger and destruction in the motherland, they are determined to contribute their skills to their compatriots. Because he knows that the more difficult the situation in China, the more doctors and teachers are needed.

    The Liang children returned to China. They first lived in Beijing under the rule of the Kuomintang. But they did not live there for long. The two of them saw that the hospital relied entirely on the charity of the rich for support. There, they could not stand the American soldiers swaggering around like the chosen ones, the bourgeoisie living extravagantly, and the coolies starving to death before their eyes.

    James and Mary realized that this was not the real China. They resolutely left that environment and went to their parents' hometown.

    In this village, all the terrible realities of feudal China are revealed: poverty, hunger, unsanitary conditions, and disease. There are no schools, no teachers, and no medical facilities. The village landlord, Tao Bo, the head of the Liang family, spends his days flattering the warlords and squeezing the peasants himself. Even in his wealthy home, life is primitive - no lights, no books, not even soap.

    Pearl Buck uses heavy brushstrokes to describe this dark life. The Chinese countryside she knows is actually decades ago, but she uses it as the background for today. She is determined not to let a new idea or a little revolutionary sentiment into that thatched cottage. She gives the reader the impression of this abstract, rigid Chinese countryside, denying the tremendous changes that the Chinese peasants have experienced. Even though the time is set after World War II, and when the Chinese People's Liberation War has developed to an all-out level.

    In this primitive village, James Liang tries his best to help the peasants and becomes a part of them. This is their home, their compatriots, here they must live and work.

    The pampered and frivolous Louise is different. She is in love with this American youth today and changes to another tomorrow. Her brother James advises her: "I have decided to get married and settle down in China. I will never let my children leave their hometown. They must take root here before going out, so that no matter how far they go, they will come back. No matter what they do, they will not forget their compatriots. They must also establish a career here." (Page 166)

    Louise, whose mind is empty, cannot live without jazz and dancing. She thinks her brother's patriotic ideas are too outdated. She likes New York more than China. But her other sister, Mary, is different. She established a simple hospital in the village, taught the children to read, and taught the adults basic hygiene knowledge. They think that this way they have united with their relatives and friends in the village, and they have fulfilled their medical obligations. They think life is complete. Mary married a young doctor named Chen, and James married a strange rural girl in the old-fashioned way. This was done when his mother came from New York to visit the village. Everyone seems to be getting what they want. It seems—because when the reader closes the book, they cannot help but be angry at the emptiness and fabrication of the whole book.

    In this novel, Pearl Buck attempts to deal with the issue of loving the motherland and discuss how the Chinese people who love the motherland serve the country. But her reactionary prejudice makes it impossible for her to give an appropriate answer to this question.

    The Chinese youth in her book who are the protagonists are precisely the most vivid negation of cosmopolitanism. Their love for the motherland and their concern for the health and welfare of their compatriots outweigh everything else. Pearl Buck cannot ignore the surging patriotic emotions of the Chinese people and their enthusiasm for building the new China. She wrote this point. But she did not even touch on the question of what the new China should be like. She did not give a satisfactory answer to the important question she raised: if a Chinese person sincerely wants to serve their motherland and compatriots, what should they do? She could not answer because her reactionary prejudice blinded her, making it impossible for her to understand the truth of life, because she wanted to blind her readers, making it impossible for them to know the wishes of the Chinese people.

    The American imperialists, who have tried so hard to enslave China, will not point out a positive path for China. They cannot propose any alternative other than taking steps to oppose the progressive forces in China led by the Communist Party. Pearl Buck provides that sincere Chinese people should serve the people, but she cannot propose any effective solution. She pretends that there is no progressive program for actively revitalizing China. This political prejudice not only swept away Pearl Buck's authority as a "China expert," but also damaged her qualifications as a writer and artist. She not only wrote the characters with lofty aspirations in her pen as blind visionaries, but simply made them half-blind idiots.

    In order to help the people, James and Mary used their own money to build hospitals and schools for the village. But where did their money come from? From Tao Bo, as the rent they deserved in their name. The two of them used the money squeezed from the peasants to complete their noble mission. They even discussed with James' wife, Yu Mei, whether the peasants would murder their Tao Bo, and thus James was also worried that the peasants would kill him and his sister.

    This is how Pearl Buck deals with her characters with lofty aspirations! In order to ignore the revolutionary forces leading the entire Chinese people towards progress and happiness, she absurdly and completely conceals the revolutionary movement that permeates China and the new views it has caused among the peasants.

    Pearl Buck's attempt to "eliminate" the Chinese Communist Party is laughable. As a writer, when describing peasants, coolies, workers, students, and doctors, she cannot avoid mentioning communism and the Communist Party. But she does not let them say a true word, but only repeatedly repeats the slanders of "bandits" and "sabotage." She wants to give the reader the impression that her characters are unaware of the Communist Party and its propositions. Her entire book implies a hatred for the democratic forces in China, although she cannot come up with any sound reasons for opposing them.

    This book also greatly slanders Chinese students. Everyone knows that students played an active role in resisting the Kuomintang regime and strongly supporting the liberation movement. Pearl Buck obviously knows this, and her writing about the student movement in Beijing is full of hatred and contempt.

    Pearl Buck cannot hide the collapse of feudal China and the Kuomintang regime, and she cannot conceal the decay and despair of the old ruling class. But she is unwilling to face reality, and only widely says that "war" and "the chaos of war" are what forced the reactionary rich people in China to sweep away and escape to the United States. Sometimes she also indicates that the "government"—referring to the Kuomintang—will deal with the overall situation. In fact, in 1949 (the publication date of this book), China already had a government that could deal with the overall situation! But it is a government that is completely different from what Pearl Buck and the reactionary bourgeoisie of China hoped for!

    Shameless slander of China's progressive democratic forces, evil and unfounded conjecture, fabricated stories of overseas Chinese returning to their hometowns in New York, and even the pathetic idealization of the feudal patriarchal system - all these counterfeit goods have been moved out, just to cover up the truth about current China.

    But the world already knows the truth. Even millions of young Liang and Chen know it. The truth is that China's progressive forces, under the leadership of the Communist Party, are building a new democratic China. They serve the people, unlike the American "China experts" who are thrown from skyscrapers to Chinese soil, groping in solitude, carrying a Bible in one hand and a typhoid vaccine in the other. No, they first start from the root of the people's suffering—eliminating the shackles of imperialism and landlords, establishing new social system relations, and eradicating the influence of feudalism from then on. This is a living reality, and Pearl Buck, who sold her pen to the imperialist oppressors, is still evading it. Therefore, she is completely bankrupt—politically, artistically, and morally bankrupt.

　　破了产的“中国专家”
　　沙杰耶夫
　　评赛珍珠近著《一家人》
    （萧梅译自《新时代》第十一期，三月十五日莫斯科航空版。转载四月十七日上海大公报）
    赛珍珠最近（一九四九年纽约出版——译者）写了一本以新中国为题材的小说，书名《一家人》，相当受到注意。作者在这书里，以“中国专家”的身份，凭着精通中国人情风俗的资望，企图谈一谈有关今天中国的政治、道德、和心理各方面的事物。故事的主题是述说现代中国爱国青年及其怎样为祖国服务。
    作者原是传教士的女儿，自己也传过教，在中国住过多年。她有写作的才份是无疑问的，她所写的关于中国人的生活，特别是她笔下的中国农民，战前出版的《母亲》、《大地》、《儿子》确曾红过半边天，在苏联也有译本，销路并且很好。
    然而，赛珍珠的著作总使人感到有一个显著的缺陷，这就是她极力想闪躲不谈的关于近代中国划时代的政治和社会革命。赛珍珠从来就不是个具有进步思想的人，她的文学天才和观察事物的能力，有时纠正了一些她的偏见，同时生活的真理克服了她在政治上的错误观点。所以尽管她对于中国社会进步势力如此陌生，她的著作特别是早期的终于还是有其显著影响的。她暴露了中国农民的贫穷，他们如何渴望有土地，他们所受的沉重剥削，毫无人性的军阀的蹂躏。作者在这一点上生动地刻划了中国农民善良坚苦的性格，中国人民最优美的性格从这些农民身上表现出来；有着残余的封建恶势力，强盗般军阀，及贪得无厌的买办资产阶级为背景，他们就更凸出了。
    但是连她初期作品，赛珍珠所写的中国现实，也只是一面的。正因为她不让读者知道中国政治生活与阶级斗争，她的书原可以帮助读者了解中国人民革命的原因，但这和她的原旨是不符合的。她根本就不要了解在中国进行着的革命过程。她不肯谈到中国广大的革命运动的推展。她不肯理解中国革命的障碍，对于中国人民伟大的解放战争，赛珍珠站的不是中国人民那一面。
    尽管她对中国的风土人情、传统习惯，以至于中国人的心理，下过怎么一番苦功夫，但她全然漠视了中国人民的政治生活和愿望。这正是她在政治上对征服中国的美帝国主义资本家的贡献。
    当整个中国燃烧在争取解放的战火中，万千人民英勇坚苦地和蒋介石集团及帝国主义者做着殊死战，当新中国在共产党的领导下正在建设新的社会关系时，赛珍珠笔下的人物却宛如生活在真空管里，对于这一切现实竟然毫无所闻。
    自然，有时赛珍珠无法躲开“共产党”这个字——共产党在中国占的重要性已成为美国的“中国专家”心目中的问题了。但她对这问题的仅有的解答法就是摹仿美帝的法螺，放施无耻又无稽的诬蔑。就是直到今天她依旧牢守着这个立场。
    她在政治上的意见和她所写的论国际的文章中，赛珍珠向来是戴着侵略的美帝的眼镜。即在今天，她还在梦想只要“美援”来得充裕，历史仍然能扭转过来，旧中国还能死而复苏。
    读者在赛珍珠的书中是不会找到一个“帝国主义”的。偶然在她书中出现一两个洋人，都是些慷慨好义，慈悲为怀的医生、牧师之流。用她的笔，她想来支持中国的封建，赞扬那停滞、落后的家长制度的生活方式。
    她这本新著，《一家人》是写在中国的人民解放战争胜利高潮的时候，可是赛珍珠却依旧执着于她那自欺欺人的幻想，企图把自己砌在一堵厚墙里，与一切政治，以及中国社会的蜕变绝缘。这样悖逆了现实，她自找并且找到了彻底失败。倾她所有的文学才能也不足以挽救她的。无论作为艺术家或中国专家，赛珍珠的新著都给她盖上了破产的火漆封印。
    《一家人》的时间是当前，背景是在纽约、北京，和华中僻远的乡村。主要人物：一些侨居美国，接受了美国生活方式的中国知识分子及资产阶级。写这个氛围，赛珍珠是极能胜任的。她为这群依附美国施惠而苟存的中国布尔乔亚知识分子画了一幅逼真的肖像，背弃了祖国和人民的无原则的一伙。她描写了凭着军火合同起家的暴发户，把款子存进美国银行，然后便由国民党垮了台的中国逃出，就象李氏、张氏夫妇，和丁氏及他们完全美国化了的少男少女，在纽约尽情挥霍，过着糜烂荒淫的生活。
    这本书写出了精神贫乏，没有祖国思想的青年，娇生惯养，堕落，深深中了美国主义的毒，忘记了祖国的语言。但注定的是：出身的高贵，家私的雄厚，以致欧洲的派头都不能使他们在异国谋到一点地位。在美国充满种族歧视的布尔乔亚眼中，一个中国人无论教育程度怎样高，甚至阔而且漂亮的姑娘，都一样是低于白色人的动物。
    《一家人》讲的是美国化了的姓梁的家庭。父亲梁博士在纽约做中国文学的教授，精读孔书，擅诗词歌赋，深受一些怪僻的美国太太们的宠爱。彻头彻尾反动的梁博士，是一个十足道地的伪君子。他住在美国是因为那里进项大，而且舒服。他讲究“中国礼仪”，然而他对中国文化的崇敬也止于外表。
    这个美国化了的孔教徒的虚伪琐碎的心里，借他与他妻子的关系逼真地表现了出来。文雅教授的妻子是一个简单的乡下女人。他们的结婚是奉了父母之命的。赛珍珠自己似乎对这种婚姻方式发生莫大兴趣，尽管当代的中国青年赞成的是自由结婚。在古老的中国，一个妻子没有发言权，也不成为独立的人格。梁太太便是他丈夫驯顺的仆人。在梁教授脑海里，妇，孺，和傻子都是一种人物。除了顺从丈夫，遵守家规，和对社会上的事不闻不问以外，梁太太依然保有她的个性。读者对于这个愚盲，识不上几个字的平凡但是有着一颗好心的女子，还是很喜欢，她有的是常识，良心上没有半点沾污。梁太太和梁教授完全相反。梁教授不知有祖国，一切从自我出发，麻木不仁；她却缅怀着故乡里那座小村庄，无论她在美国住多久，她永远是个外国人。美国对她永远是不可懂的，甚而仇视的。她留在纽约，完全是因为她的丈夫。
    他们四个孩子：儿子吉姆斯和彼得，女儿玛丽和鲁易丝。他们既有个交游广泛的父亲，前程自然无虑了。吉姆斯梁学的是外科。他还没毕业，纽约一家诊所便已聘请他了。
    但吉姆斯另有他自己的计划。他和妹妹玛丽并不喜欢他们周围那世界主义的环境。他们爱他们的祖国，并且知道那里需要人才。他们更愿意在祖国最迫切需要的时候回去。他们不怕回去受苦，祖国尽管有着饥饿和破坏，他们决心以自己学的本领贡献给自己的同胞。因为他知道中国境况愈艰苦，就愈需要医生和教师。
    梁家的孩子们回到了中国。他们先住在国民党统治的北京。但他们住了没多久。两个人看见医院全然靠着富人施舍来支持。在那里，他们看不惯美国军人如天之骄子般摆来摆去，布尔乔亚穷奢极侈，而苦力们竟眼睁睁饿死。
    吉姆斯和玛丽看出这不是真正的中国。他们又毅然离开那环境，而到他们父母的老家去了。
    在这个村庄里，所有封建中国的可怕的现实都毕露了：贫匮，饥饿，不卫生，和疾病。没有学校，没有教员，也没有医药设备。村中的地主，陶伯，梁家的家长，成天拍军阀的马屁，自己压榨着农民。连在他那富有的家里，生活都是原始的——没有灯，没有书，甚而没有肥皂。
    在描写这种暗无天日的生活上，赛珍珠用的是浓重的笔触。她所知道的中国农村其实是在几十年前的了，但她把它当做今日的背景。她决心不让那草屋里有一个新的观念，有一点点革命情绪。她给读者的是这个抽象，僵死了的中国农村的印象，否定了中国农民所经历的巨大变化。尽管时间是放在第二次大战以后，而且是在中国人民解放战争发展到全面的时候。
    在这个原始的村庄，吉姆斯梁尽力帮助农民，并且变成他们中间的一分子。这是他们的家，他们的同胞，这里，他们必须生活及工作下去。
    娇生惯养，性格轻浮的娃娃鲁易丝可不然了。她今天同这个美国青年恋爱，明天又换一个。哥哥吉姆斯这样劝她：“我决定在中国结婚安家了。我永不让我的孩子们离开本乡本土。他们必须在这里扎了根再出去，那样，无论他们走多远，都会回来的。无论做什么，他们也都忘不了同胞。他们也一定要在这里成家立业。”（一六六页）
    思想空洞的鲁易丝，没有爵士乐，没有跳舞，是活不成的。她嫌她哥哥的爱国思想太不时髦，她喜欢纽约多于中国。但是另一个妹妹玛丽则不然，她在村子里建立了一个设备简陋的医院，并且教小孩子们识字，教大人们粗浅的卫生常识。他们自以为这样便与村中的戚友们结合起来了，并且算是尽了医学上的义务。他们认为人生已圆满了。玛丽嫁了一个姓陈的青年医生，吉姆斯则照旧式办法娶了一个陌生的乡下姑娘。这是他母亲由纽约来到村中看望时办的。人人都似乎各得其所了。似乎——因为读者关上书本，不能不为全书的空架虚构而气愤。
    赛珍珠在这本小说里是企图处理爱祖国这一问题，并且讨论爱祖国的中国人民怎样为国家服务。但她的反动的成见使她无法对这问题予以适当的解答。
    她书中做为主人公的中国青年正是世界主义最生动的否定。他们对祖国的爱，他们对同胞的健康和福利的关切超过了其他一切。赛珍珠无法忽视中国人民爱国情绪的澎湃，和他们对于新中国建设的热情。这一点她写上了。但新中国应该是怎样的，这一问题她连碰也没碰。她对自己所提出的如果一个中国人真诚愿意为其祖国及同胞服务，应做些什么，这一重大问题，她毫没有予以圆满的解答。她答不出来，是因为她那反动的成见蒙蔽了她，使她无从了解到人生的真理，是因为她要蒙蔽她的读者，使他们无从知道中国人民大众的愿望。
    美国帝国主义者曾那样企图奴役中国，是不会给中国指出什么积极的道路来的。他们无法在敌视共产党为首的中国进步势力的步骤外，提出什么对案来的。赛珍珠一面提供了真诚的中国人应为人民服务，一面却提不出什么有效的解决。她假装着当前没有一个积极使中国重生的进步政纲。这种政治成见不但使赛珍珠的“中国专家”的权威扫地，并且也损害了她的作家及艺术家的资格。她把她笔下有崇高抱负的人物不但写成了走瞎路的玄想家，简直成为半盲的白痴了。
    为了帮助人民，吉姆斯和玛丽用他们自己的款子为村子建立了医院和学校。但他们的款子从那里来的呢？从陶伯，作为他们名下应得的佃租。两个人是用剥自农民身上的钱来完成他们崇高的任务。他俩甚而和吉姆斯的妻子玉美议论农民会不会谋害他们的陶伯，从而吉姆斯也担心农民也会把他和他的妹妹杀害的。
    赛珍珠就是如此处理她的有着崇高抱负的人物！为了漠视领导着全中国人民走向进步与幸福的革命力量，她不惜荒谬地把弥漫全中国的革命运动及它在农民间所引起的新看法完全隐蔽起来。
    赛珍珠“消灭”中国共产党的企图是可笑到家了。作为一个作家，在描写农民、苦力、工人、学生、和医生时，她又无法不提共产主义及共产党。但她不让他们说一句真话，而仅仅一再重复“匪徒”“破坏”一类污蔑的话语。她愿意给读者的印象是她的人物对于共产党及其主张是无所闻的。她的全书中隐含着一股对中国民主力量的仇恨，虽然他也拿不出什么反对的响亮理由。
    这本书对中国学生也大事污蔑。谁都知道在反抗国民党政权及有力地支持解放运动上，学生们曾起过积极作用。赛珍珠显然也知道这点，而她写到北京的学生运动时，是充满了仇恨和藐视。
    赛珍珠无法隐瞒封建中国及国民党政权的崩溃，她无法掩饰旧的统治阶级的腐朽和绝望。但她不愿面对现实，只一味广泛地说“战争”及“战争的混乱”，是这些逼使中国反动的阔人席卷逃到美国去，有时候她还表示“政府”——指国民党，将会应付一切局势的。其实，在一九四九年（这本书的出版日期），中国已经有了一个应付一切局势的政府了。但却是与赛珍珠及中国反动的资产阶级所希望的截然不同的政府！
    对于中国进步民主力量的无耻污蔑，恶劣而毫无根据的臆说，虚构的纽约华侨还乡，以至对封建的家长制度可怜的理想化——所有这些赝品都搬上来了，只为了遮掩着当前中国的真相。
    但世界早已知道那真相了。甚至千千万万年轻的梁某陈某也知道了。那真相便是：中国进步力量在共产党领导下，正在建设着一个新的民主的中国。他们服务人民，与美国的“中国专家”由摩天楼上抛到中国土地的，在孤独中摸索的，一手拿着圣经，一手捧着伤寒预防针的一些传教士不同。不，他们首先从人民疾苦的根本上着手——消灭帝国主义及地主们的锁枷，建立新的社会制度关系，使封建影响从此拔根。这是活生生的现实，而把她的笔出卖给了帝国主义压迫者的赛珍珠还在躲避。因此，她便全部破产了——政治、文艺、和道德都破产了。
