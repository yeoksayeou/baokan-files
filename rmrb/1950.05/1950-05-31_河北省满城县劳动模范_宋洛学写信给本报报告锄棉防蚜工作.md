Hebei Province Mancheng County Model Worker
Song Luoxue Writes to This Newspaper Reporting on Cotton Weeding and Aphid Prevention Work

[This Newspaper] Song Luoxue, a labor model from Songjia Village, Mancheng County, Hebei Province, recently sent a letter to this newspaper reporting on cotton weeding and aphid prevention work. The original letter is as follows:

Comrades in charge of the People's Daily Editorial Department:

In order to keep you informed of the cotton cultivation situation in Songjia and the other six villages using the Sizi No. 2 cotton strain at each stage, to strengthen your specific guidance to us, and to achieve increased cotton and grain production, we are reporting the development of the weeding and aphid prevention campaign in our six villages as follows:

Our village finished planting cotton on the 5th of this month. Thanks to the efforts of all Party members, League members, representatives, and cadres, we successfully completed raking the cotton (700 mu) after the rain and checking and replanting seedlings (120 mu), ensuring full stands of cotton on all 900 mu in the village.

In order to ensure seed preservation and a good harvest and to prevent and control diseases and insect pests, we convened a general meeting of all Party members on the 12th of this month to deploy the "weeding and aphid prevention" work, deciding that each Party member should first weed their own land clean and then launch a publicity campaign. Immediately following this, on the evening of the 17th, a general meeting of all villagers was convened to implement this spirit, emphasizing that weeding not only prevents aphids and loosens the soil, allowing cotton seedlings to grow faster, but also reduces damage to cotton plants from mole crickets (if the land is not completely loosened, mole crickets will crawl along the loose soil in the seedling ridges, eating the cotton seedlings); at the same time, comrades Guo Lianqi from the Provincial Farm Guidance Area and Yuan Jingchun from the Agricultural College also showed villagers aphids on the grass they had pulled and organized children to launch a publicity campaign. After in-depth publicity and education, most villagers understood the principle that aphids parasitize on grass roots and were confident that weeding could prevent aphids. In order to influence and mobilize the masses to take action quickly, my family's 7.5 mu of cotton fields were first weeded completely clean in three days from the 13th to the 15th. Party member Song Zhengcai, together with his younger brother Jinsheng, weeded the grass on six mu of cotton fields five li east of the village in one day on the 17th. Branch Committee member Wang Xuan's 5.5 mu of cotton fields have also had five mu weeded. Of the 22 Party members in our village, who planted 147 mu of cotton, 117 mu had been weeded by the 22nd. Because the Sizi No. 2 cotton seeds sprouted well, it further boosted the villagers' enthusiasm for planting cotton. Party member Song Luozuo said: "This year the cotton seedlings are so strong, I must plant these five mu of cotton well, guaranteeing to weed it six or seven times, not allowing a single blade of grass to grow in the field, and striving to pick 150 to 160 jin of cotton per mu." The application of fertilizer has increased compared to previous years. According to reports from fertilizer-deficient households, they plan to use 4,000 jin of fertilized soil powder, which they will pick up from the farm in the coming days. The intensity of cultivation has improved compared to any previous year. This year, the first step is to weed once, then thin the seedlings once (leaving four or five inches between plants), and the third step is the final thinning (in previous years, we waited for the cotton seedlings to grow up before weeding and thinning, doing it only twice, never weeding in advance). Under the influence of the Party members' active weeding, the whole village saw a weeding upsurge on the 17th. For example, Song Huanxiang's twelve-year-old daughter, Qing'er, saw others going to weed and took her own small hoe to weed, finishing three mu of cotton fields in just over a day; the six mu of cotton fields belonging to soldier's family Song Zhuotang were also weeded clean by his daughter Song Sier. With the active action of all Party members and the masses, more than 600 mu of the 900 mu of cotton fields in the village had been weeded by the 23rd, and it is estimated that all will be weeded in another two days.

Since the six village administrations, cotton planting committees, and cadre meetings were convened in Libao and the other five villages on the 14th, each village has successively mobilized. More than 400 mu of the 590 mu of cotton fields in Dajia Village had been weeded by the 23rd; and more than 1,200 mu of the 1,700 mu in Libao, Houtun, and the other four villages had also been weeded, and it is estimated that all will be weeded by the 25th.

In addition to calling on the masses to pay attention to cotton diseases and insect pests, I am now planning to convene a meeting of village cadres from the six villages in the next few days to implement the spirit of the second county government committee meeting on the 17th, to do a good job in wheat protection, to establish wheat protection covenants, to organize wheat protection committees to implement joint village wheat protection, and to carry out field selection of wheat seeds, implementing quick harvesting, quick threshing, and quick drying, to prevent wind and hail, and to ensure seed preservation and a good harvest. I will report the progress of this work to you next time. I hope to receive your letters of guidance regularly in the future!

With best regards,
Song Luoxue, May 24th

(Editor's Note: This letter from Song Luoxue, a labor model in Mancheng County, Hebei, timely reflects many specific issues in the cotton planting work in his village. These experiences are well worth learning from by cadres leading agricultural production and the broad masses of cotton farmers in various regions. We hope that labor models and labor heroes in various regions can also, like Song Luoxue, regularly write to us about their production situations and experiences in order to exchange agricultural production experiences in various regions.)

　　河北省满城县劳动模范
    宋洛学写信给本报报告锄棉防蚜工作
    【本报讯】河北省满城县宋贾村劳动模范宋洛学，顷致函本报，报告锄棉防蚜工作，原函如下：人民日报编辑部负责同志：
    为了使你们随时了解宋贾等六个斯字二号棉良种村每个时期的整棉情况，以加强对我们的具体指导，达到棉粮增产，特将我们六个村的除草防蚜运动的开展情形报告如下：
    我村种棉于本月五日即告结束。在全体党员、团员、代表、干部的努力之下，胜利的完成了雨后扒棉（七百亩）和查苗补苗（一百二十亩）的工作，使全村九百亩棉花保证了满苗。
    为了作到保种保收，防除病虫害，我们于本月十二日召开了全体党员大会，布置了“除草防蚜”的工作，决定每个党员首先把自己地内的草锄干净，并要展开宣传。紧接着于十七日晚又召开了全村群众大会，贯彻了这一精神，着重说明除草不仅可以防蚜虫，地松无草棉苗长得也会快，又可减少蝼蛄对棉棵的危害（若不把地全部锄松，蝼蛄就会顺着苗垅内的松土爬行专吃棉苗）；同时省农场指导区郭连起、农学院原景春等同志亦在我村拿草上的蚜虫让群众看，并组织儿童展开宣传。经过深入的宣传与教育后，大部群众都明白了蚜虫在草根上寄生的道理，对除草可以防蚜已有了信心。为了影响与带动群众迅速行动起来，我家的七亩半棉田首先在十三日至十五日三天内就把草锄得干干净净了。党员宋正才领着他的弟弟金生于十七日一天就把村东五里远的六亩棉地的草?完了。支委王萱的五亩半棉田也已锄了五亩。我村二十二个党员，种棉一百四十七亩，至二十二日已锄了一百一十七亩。由于斯字二号棉籽出的好，更鼓起了群众的种棉情绪。党员宋洛佐说：“今年棉苗这么强，我非把这五亩棉种好不行，保证锄它六、七遍，不叫地内长一棵草，每亩争取摘棉一百五、六十斤”。在施肥上比往年有了增加，据缺肥户自报，计划使用肥田粉四千斤，近日即到农场去取。在精耕细作上比以往任何一年都有提高，今年都是先锄一次草，再间苗一次（棵间四五寸），第三次才是最后定苗（在往年是等着棉苗长成了才锄草间苗，两次就成，从不提前先锄一遍）。在党员积极锄草的影响下，全村在十七日即造成了锄草热潮。如宋焕祥十二岁的女孩青儿，见到别人去?，自己也拿着小锄去?，三亩棉地一天多就锄完了；军属宋卓堂的六亩棉地也由他的女儿宋四尔把草锄净。在全体党员、群众的积极行动下，全村九百亩棉田至二十三日已锄了六百多亩，再有两天即可全部?完。
    李堡等五个村，自十四日召开了六村村政权、植棉委员会和干部会议后，各村即先后动起来了。大贾村五百九十亩棉田至二十三日已锄了四百多亩；李堡、后屯等四村一千七百多亩也锄了一千二百多亩，估计二十五日即可全部锄完。
    我现在计划除了号召群众经常注意棉花的病虫害外，在最近几天还要召开一次六个村村干部会议，以贯彻十七日第二届县府委员会议的精神，搞好护麦工作，订立护麦公约。组织护麦委员会实行联村护麦，并进行田间选麦种，实行快收、快打、快晒，以防风雹，作到保种保收。这些工作进行情形，下回当再报告您们。望今后经常来信指导为盼！
                                    此致敬礼
                          宋洛学五月二十四日
    （编者按：河北满城劳动模范宋洛学的这封信，及时地反映了该村种棉工作中许多具体问题。这些经验，很值得各地领导农业生产的干部和广大棉农学习。我们希望各地劳动模范、劳动英雄们也能像宋洛学这样，经常把自己的生产情况和经验写信告诉我们，以交流各地农业生产经验。）
