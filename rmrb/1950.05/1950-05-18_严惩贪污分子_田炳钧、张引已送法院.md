　　Severely Punish Corrupt Elements
　　Tian Bingjun and Zhang Yin Have Been Sent to Court

　　Tian Bingjun, a clerk at the Luan County Transfer Station in Hebei, repeatedly engaged in corruption. On one occasion, when he went to the Northeast to purchase auto parts, he embezzled 979,000 Northeast currency by "underreporting expenses and overreporting costs." Furthermore, when the Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative was moving, everyone was busy sorting things out. He took advantage of this opportunity and falsely accused Comrade Zhang Wenxiang (a child), a service worker, of stealing 100,000 yuan, claiming he had lost it. In reality, he used this money on a bad woman in Luan County.

　　Zhang Yin, a business clerk at the Special District Cooperative, also engaged in corrupt practices. He was of hooligan origin. The higher authorities sent him to the Northeast to purchase automobiles. He bought new cars from the Soviet Automobile Company in Harbin. However, he drove the cars to another auto shop, replaced the new car parts with old ones, and then sold the new parts illicitly. One of the cars was old, and he painted it to make it look like a new one, deceiving his superiors. He also falsely reported 375 jin of gasoline for test driving.

　　The Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative, in the spirit of "treating the illness to save the patient," repeatedly enlightened and educated them, urging them to boldly admit their mistakes. However, they remained obstinate, covering up and prevaricating, attempting to evade punishment. After further investigation, they finally revealed the truth. Tian and Zhang have now been sent to the court for legal punishment.

　　严惩贪污分子
　　田炳钧、张引已送法院
    河北滦县转运站业务员田炳钧一再发生贪污事件。某一次他去东北购买汽车零件，以“花少报多”的方法，贪污了东北币九十七万九千元。又在专区供销合作总社搬家时，大家都忙着整理东西，他竟趁此机会，借口失了十万元，硬诬赖勤务员张文祥同志（小孩）偷了，其实，他把这个钱用在滦县城里一个坏女人的身上。
    又专区合作社业务员张引也发生了贪污事情，他系流氓出身，上级让他去东北购买汽车，他在哈尔滨苏联汽车公司买到新车，而他竟将车开到另一家汽车行，把新车零件换上旧的，再行盗卖。其中一辆是旧车，他用油漆装饰，伪称新车，欺骗上级，又假报试车汽油三百七十五斤。
    专区供销合作社曾本着治病救人的精神，对他们进行了多次启发教育，要他们大胆承认错误，但他们仍执迷不悟，竟掩盖搪塞，企图逃避。经过再次追查，始吐露真象。现田、张两人已送法院依法惩处。
