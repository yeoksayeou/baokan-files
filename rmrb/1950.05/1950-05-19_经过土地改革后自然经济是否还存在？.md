　　Does the Natural Economy Still Exist After Land Reform?
To the Editor:
　　After land reform, does the natural economy still exist?
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Wu Zanyuan, Qixian County Committee
　　Regarding Comrade Wu Zanyuan's question, we have asked Comrade Wang Xuewen to answer as follows:
　　The so-called natural economy refers to a self-sufficient economy, as opposed to a commodity economy. This natural economy only existed to a certain extent in rural China before land reform. After land reform, the components of the commodity economy developed even faster, and the components of the natural economy became even smaller, but it cannot be said that it was completely eliminated immediately.
　　After land reform in rural areas, the feudal and semi-feudal relations of production were eliminated, especially the feudal and semi-feudal land ownership relations and the exploitation arising therefrom. New production relations were established in which producers owned land, farm implements, and draught animals. The income from farmers' production, except for the payment of a certain amount of public grain, is all owned by the producers themselves, thus increasing the farmers' labor income. This promoted expanded reproduction in rural areas, increased the sales of agricultural and sideline products, and increased farmers' purchasing power for industrial products. On the other hand, the development of urban industry and commerce increased the supply of industrial products necessary for rural areas, and the increased need for grain and raw materials also promoted the commercialization of rural production and even the rural economy. However, this kind of change and transition must go through a certain process, that is, the commercialization of agricultural production must go through stages from mostly self-sufficient to semi-self-sufficient, from semi-self-sufficient to mostly commodity production and even more commodity production, etc., and each stage must be divided into several steps to gradually move from a low degree of commercialized economy to a highly commercialized economy.
　　In short, after land reform, due to the development of agricultural and industrial productive forces, the mutual influence of agriculture and industry, and the promotion of other economic sectors, the self-sufficient components in rural areas will gradually decrease, while the commodity economy components will gradually increase. In other words, the natural economic components in rural areas will gradually shift towards a commodity economy. However, agriculture and industry have different characteristics. Generally speaking, even when the commodity economy is quite highly developed, there will still be a certain degree of self-sufficiency.

### 经过土地改革后自然经济是否还存在？

　　经过土地改革后自然经济是否还存在？编辑同志：
    经过土地改革后，自然经济是否还存在？
              淇县县委会武占元
    武占元同志所问的问题，经我们转请王学文同志解答如下：
    所谓自然经济，是指自给自足的经济，与商品经济对待而言。这种自然经济在土地改革以前的中国农村中也只是在一种程度上存在，在土地改革后，商品经济的成份发展得更快了，自然经济的成份也就更小了，但也还不能说立即完全消灭。
    农村经过土地改革后，消灭了封建的半封建的生产关系，尤其是消灭了封建的半封建的土地占有关系和由此而来的剥削，建立了生产者占有土地、农具、耕畜等的新生产关系。农民生产所得，除缴纳一定数量的公粮以外，均为生产者自己所有，因此农民的劳动收益就增加了。这就促进了农村的扩大再生产，增加农产品与副产品的出卖部分，增加农民对工业品的购买力。在另一方面，由于城市工商业的发展，供给农村所必需的工业品增多，并且对粮食与原料的需要增多，也促进了农村生产以至农村经济的商品化。但是这种变化推移，要经过一定的过程，即农业生产商品化要经过由多半自给自足走向半自给自足，由半自给自足走向多半商品生产以至更多的商品生产等等阶段，而每一阶段又要分为若干步骤才能由低度商品化经济逐步走向高度商品化经济。
    总之，土地改革以后，由于农工业生产力的发展，农工业相互的影响，以及其他经济部门的推动，农村中自给自足成份要次第减少，而商品经济成份要次第增加。换句话说：农村中自然经济成份要次第向商品经济推移。不过农业与工业性质不同，一般说来，就是到了商品经济相当高度化，还要有一定程度的自给自足性。
