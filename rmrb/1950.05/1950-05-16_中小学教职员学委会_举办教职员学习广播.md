　　[News from Beijing Municipal News Agency] The Beijing Municipal Primary and Secondary School Faculty and Staff Academic Committee, in order to assist and promote learning among primary and secondary school faculty and staff, has recently collaborated with the Beijing People's Broadcasting Station to hold radio broadcasts for faculty and staff learning programs, once a week. These broadcasts will feature recorded lectures on "On New Democracy" for study, or invite individuals to give reports, answer questions, and introduce learning methods and experiences. At the same time, all school and district academic committees have been notified to establish listening groups. Middle schools will form groups based on the school unit; primary schools will, based on radio equipment availability in the district, divide all listeners in the district into several large groups, and then form smaller groups to lead and organize radio listening.
