    Five years ago, on May 9th, the heroic Soviet Red Army helped the Czech people liberate themselves from the shackles of Hitler. Although the territory of Czechia is only about the size of one of our provinces, and its population is only about twice that of Shanghai, its history of heroic struggle and its current construction achievements are worthy of admiration.
    Czechia is located in the center of Europe and has a long history of culture. Czechia has been the center of many historical events in Europe; equivalent to the Tang Dynasty in our country, it was the center of the Great Moravian Empire established to oppose Western pressure. During the Ming Dynasty, it was the center of the Kingdom of Bohemia. At that time, Berlin was still a small town, while Prague was already a large city in Europe. It has the earliest universities and printing houses in Europe, becoming the birthplace of humanities.
    In the early fifteenth century, religious movements arose, the most famous of which was the Hussite Revolution. The leader, Huss, was a representative of the reformers of the time. This huge liberation movement against the reactionary rule of feudal landlords, the Catholic Church, and the German aristocracy in the cities, was subjected to the joint armed intervention of Germany, Britain, France, and the Roman Pope. But their ideas of fighting for freedom and independence created new strategies and tactics and defeated the attacks of foreign interventionists. They defeated the English cavalry and the famous Habsburg armies; they used light cavalry to deal with the cavalry's strict attacks, and used farm implements as weapons. Although this revolutionary movement eventually failed, and Huss was burned alive by the church, it left a profound revolutionary tradition. Representing the influence of the Hussite revolutionary thought of that era expanded, and peasant uprisings arose one after another. The famous peasant revolutionary leader Jan Žižka, he is like a legendary mysterious figure, a military strategist, he opposed religious persecution and corruption, and demanded independence and freedom. Legend has it that when he died, he said: "You use my skin to make a drum to awaken the peasants to continue the revolution." His heroic and magnificent revolutionary spirit is deeply engraved in the hearts of every Czech person.
    In the early seventeenth century, the Habsburg dynasty of the Austro-Hungarian Empire sent troops to invade the Kingdom of Bohemia. In the Battle of White Mountain, the Bohemian army was defeated. For the next 150 years, the Czech and Slovak nations lived under the enslavement of Austro-Hungary.
    In 1789, the sound of gunfire at the Bastille prison in France inspired the Czech people to begin resisting the oppression of the Habsburg dynasty.
    In 1848, all of Europe was swept into the tide of revolution. In Czechia, there was the Prague uprising in June against the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
    After the First World War, the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed. In October 1918, workers in Prague held a general strike, and on October 28, the establishment of the Czechoslovak Republic was officially announced. However, the opportunist line of the Social Democratic Party, which led the workers' movement at that time, allowed the bourgeoisie to seize the power of the young republic. After the bourgeoisie seized power, they actively attacked the working class in 1920, and the military and police occupied the headquarters and newspapers of the Social Democratic Party, thus triggering a general strike across the country, which resulted in bloody suppression by the bourgeoisie. In 1921, the Communist Party was established. Since then, the revolutionary struggle of the Czechoslovak people has had a correct leader and has become even more vigorous. Under the leadership of the leader Gottwald, after overcoming the errors of reformism, the Communist Party, regardless of the bloody suppression by the police, led the people to carry out countless strikes and hunger marches for the unemployed, such as the North Bohemian miners' strike in 1932 and the large-scale strikes of 20,000 construction workers and Brno textile workers.
    In 1938, the British and French imperialists signed the Munich Agreement with the German and Italian fascists, selling out Czechia. The Czech Communist Party has always led the Czech people in their struggle against the Munich Agreement.
    After the start of the Second World War, Hitler occupied Bohemia and Moravia, and created the "Slovak Republic" with Tiso as its capital. The Communist Party led the people to carry out underground struggles against Hitler. At the same time, regular Czech legions were organized in the Soviet Union to fight alongside the Soviet army on the Eastern Front.
    In 1939, after the occupation authorities suppressed the National Day commemoration demonstration in Prague, a funeral procession for the victims was held. In 1944, a national uprising was launched in Slovakia, severely attacking the Nazi bandits. Subsequently, the activities of guerrillas across the country increased. On May 5, 1945, with Prague as the center, an armed uprising was held throughout the country, with four days of street fighting in Prague. Now, every year on May 5th, the portraits of the martyrs of the uprising hanging on the walls of the streets and alleys of Prague are replaced with fresh wreaths. How much the people admire and mourn their heroic defenders of the country!
    During the national armed uprising, Marshal Stalin immediately mobilized the First Ukrainian Front troops from the Berlin front to support them. Thus, on May 9, the entire territory of Czechia was liberated.
    After the liberation of Czechia, a national democratic coalition government was established, with Beneš as president and Gottwald as prime minister. In the first parliamentary election in 1946, the Communist Party won 39 percent of the vote.
            II
    The Communist Party's leadership in building a workers' state was conducted amid extremely sharp class struggle. The Czech working people have consistently demonstrated great and invincible revolutionary power not only in the great revolutions of the Hussite Revolution, the anti-Austro-Hungarian rule, and the anti-Hitler enslavement, but also in the process of building and consolidating the people's democratic regime. Since the establishment of the Czech People's Republic, British and American imperialism and its agents, the domestic bourgeoisie, have done everything possible to engage in sabotage and espionage activities in an attempt to subvert the young republic and restore the old bloody rule of the bourgeoisie. The February events that shocked the world were the most blatant and concentrated manifestation of this reactionary conspiracy.
    On February 19, 1948, twelve ministers from the reactionary parties—the National Socialist Party, the People's Party, and the Slovak Democratic Party—jointly resigned, citing the improper reorganization of the National Security Corps by the Ministry of Interior, intending to drive the Communist Party out. The next day, a grand mass demonstration was held in Prague, and on the 24th, a general strike was held throughout the country to express the people's protest. After five days of hesitation, President Beneš saw the people's firm opposition to the reactionary parties' coup plot and approved the resignations of the reactionary ministers. The February events ended with the victory of the revolutionary forces.
    After the February events, the reactionaries within the National Front were purged, which changed the previous balance of class forces in the country, giving a fatal blow to the reactionary forces at home and abroad.
    The new constitution was promulgated on May 9, 1948. The constitution declares and guarantees that liberated Czechoslovakia will move towards a future of peace, prosperity, freedom, and equality. The fundamental changes that have taken place in the nature of the state, the organization of government agencies, the rights and obligations of the people, and the political, economic, and social systems are legally recognized in the constitution.
    National committees were established in the provinces, districts, and villages in the second half of 1943, and at that time they were organizations leading the struggle against fascists and traitors. After liberation, the national committees were important supporters of the new democratic regime. In January 1949, local governments were reorganized throughout the country, abolishing the huge bureaucratic organizations of the past provincial national committees and reorganizing them into state, district, and village-level national committees.
    Shortly after the February events, a national parliamentary election was held. As a result of the election, the National Front led by the Communist Party won 89.2 percent of the vote. In the working-class areas, 97 to 99 percent of the voters voted in favor of the National Front. This is enough to prove how the new National Front led by the Czech Communist Party has gained the trust of the people. In early June 1948, Beneš resigned, and the parliament unanimously elected Gottwald as president.
            III
    The Czechoslovak people have achieved victory in the political struggle against the reactionaries, and have also achieved brilliant results in economic construction.
    The People's Government implemented land reform and nationalization decrees shortly after liberation, and the bourgeoisie did its best to obstruct and sabotage these democratic reforms. It was not until after the February events that these democratic reforms were fully realized.
    After the Second Nationalization Decree and the re-amended Land Reform Decree, the state has made significant achievements in restricting capitalist elements in the economy; in addition to nationalizing foreign capital and large bourgeois mines, banks, insurance companies, power, metallurgy, armaments, and chemical industries, it has also nationalized enterprises employing more than 5,000 people, wholesale industries, and foreign trade. To date, 98 percent of industry, 100 percent of transportation, wholesale and foreign trade, and more than 80 percent of the construction industry are state-owned. As for land reform, in addition to confiscating the land and property of Germans and former Hungarian landlord aristocrats and traitors, the state has also bought land from landowners holding more than 50 hectares and distributed it to landless or land-poor farmers. At present, land is being further distributed to implement land-to-the-tiller. The result of nationalization not only guarantees the leading role of the state-owned economy in the national economy, but also makes the implementation of economic plans possible. The result of land reform has destroyed feudal forces, satisfied the peasants' land demands, and resolved the Czech people's long-standing hatred of German and Hungarian aristocratic landlords.
    The goal of the two-year plan for economic recovery from 1947 to 1948 was to exceed the pre-war industrial level by 10 percent and to industrialize backward Slovakia. When the two-year plan was completed in October 1948, the total output completed 101 percent, and the output of individual industries, if 1937 is taken as 100, then minerals were 113.3, power was 183.9, metals were 117.8, chemicals were 124, leather and rubber were 112.1, and building materials were 117.5. Agriculture was not completed due to the severe drought and sabotage in 1947. One of the biggest gains of the two-year plan was the industrialization of Slovakia. The successful completion of the two-year plan laid the foundation for the five-year plan from 1949 to 1953.
    The completion of the five-year plan will further improve the living standards of urban and rural workers and lay the foundation for socialism. The five-year plan aims to change the Czech economic structure, making the development of heavy industry exceed light industry, that is, heavy industry accounts for 60 percent of industrial output and light industry accounts for 40 percent. When the plan is completed, national income will increase by 50 percent compared with 1948, total industrial output will increase by 57 percent, and agricultural products will increase by 15 percent. The five-year plan will mechanize and electrify agriculture and finally complete collective farms. In 1949, the first year of the five-year plan, the total output completed 102.8 percent of the plan.
    Now beggars have disappeared throughout Czechia, and there is no unemployment in the country. The actual wages of workers last year increased by another 20 percent compared with the completion of the two-year plan, the rationing system has been abolished, social insurance has doubled compared with before the war, and education funding has tripled.
    The state's budget can reflect a country's economic system. In 1949, the Czech government's budget not only had no deficit, but also had a surplus of 350 million crowns (Czech currency). Last year, industrial production investment was the largest item in the budget, social welfare accounted for 26.3 percent, culture and education accounted for 11.9 percent, and national defense accounted for only 9 percent. In the US budget, culture and education only account for 2 percent, while national defense accounts for 60 percent. This is a stark contrast.
    Due to the existence of the powerful socialist Soviet Union and its fraternal assistance, the Czech people were liberated from German enslavement and avoided the intervention of foreign imperialism. Under the leadership of Communist Party Chairman and President Gottwald, the Czech people are marching towards the road of freedom, happiness, and brilliant socialism.

　　——东欧人民民主国家介绍

            一
    五年前的五月九日，英勇的苏联红军帮助捷克人民自希特勒的枷锁下解放出来。虽然捷克的版图只有我国一省那么大，人口只相当两倍于上海市，但她过去人民英勇斗争的历史，她现在的建设成就，都足令人敬佩。
    捷克地居欧洲中心，有很悠久的文化。捷克曾是欧洲许多历史事件的中心；相当于我国唐朝时，她是反对西方压力而建立起来的大摩拉维亚帝国的中心。在明朝时，她是波希米亚王国的中心。那时柏林还是个小镇，而布拉格已是欧洲的大城市了。她有欧洲最早的大学和印刷厂，成为人文科学的发源地。
    十五世纪初，宗教运动兴起，最有名的就是胡斯派（Hussite）革命。领袖胡斯（Huss），就是当时改革家的代表。这个巨大的反对封建地主和天主教会以及城市中日尔曼贵族的反动统治之解放运动，受到了德、英、法和罗马教皇的联合武装干涉。但他们为自由与独立而斗争的思想创造了新的战略战术，而击败了外国干涉者的进攻。他们打败了英国的骑兵和有名的哈普斯堡军队；他们用轻骑兵来对付骑兵的严阵的进攻，以农具作武器。这一革命运动最后虽告失败，胡斯被教会活活烧死，但遗留下深刻的革命传统。代表那时代的胡斯革命思想的影响扩大着，农民暴动此起彼伏。著名的农民革命领袖杨雪斯克，他好似一个传奇式的神秘人物，是一个军事战略家，他反对宗教的迫害和腐败，要求独立与自由。传说他死时曾说：“你们把我的皮作一个鼓，来唤起农民继续革命”，他的英勇壮烈的革命精神深深地镌刻在每个捷克人民的心坎里。
    十七世纪初，奥匈帝国的哈普斯堡王朝举兵侵略波希米亚王国，白山一役，把波希米亚军队打败。此后的一百五十年中，捷克和斯洛伐克两民族就在奥匈统治下过着奴役的生活。
    一七八九年，法国巴士底监狱的枪声，曾激起了捷克人民开始反抗哈普斯堡王朝的压迫。
    一八四八年全欧洲都卷入革命的浪潮，在捷克曾经发生六月的布拉格起义，反对奥匈帝国的统治。
    第一次世界大战后，奥匈帝国崩溃。一九一八年十月，布拉格工人举行了大罢工，十月二十八日正式宣布了捷克斯洛伐克共和国的成立。可是当时领导工人运动的社会民主党的机会主义路线，使年青共和国的政权，被资产阶级所窃据。资产阶级掌握了政权后，在一九二○年积极向工人阶级进攻，军警占领社会民主党的总部与报馆，因此全国又掀起了总罢工，结果遭到资产阶级血腥的镇压。到一九二一年，共产党成立了。从此捷克斯洛伐克人民的革命斗争，有了正确的领导者，而益加蓬勃了。共产党在领袖哥特瓦尔德领导下，于克服了改良主义的错误后，不顾宪警的血腥镇压，领导人民进行无数次的罢工和失业的饥饿游行，如一九三二年北波希米亚矿工大罢工，二万建筑工人和布尔诺纺织工人的大罢工等。
    一九三八年，英法帝国主义者与德意法西斯订立慕尼黑协定，出卖了捷克，捷克共产党始终领导着捷克人民进行反对慕尼黑协定的斗争。
    第二次世界大战开始后，希特勒占领了波希米亚与摩拉维亚，并制造了以铁索（Tiso）为首都的“斯洛伐克共和国”。共产党领导人民进行反希特勒的地下斗争。同时在苏联境内组织正规的捷克兵团，在东线与苏军并肩作战。
    一九三九年，布拉格群众的国庆纪念大示威游行被占领者镇压后，接着又举行被难者出殡游行。一九四四年在斯洛伐克境内又进行民族起义，痛击了纳粹匪军。随后全国游击队的活动日益增涨。一九四五年五月五日，以布拉格为中心，全国举行武装起义，布拉格巷战四日。现在每年五月五日在布拉格的街头巷尾的墙上挂着的起义烈士的遗像，都换上了新鲜的花圈。人民是多么敬悼着他们英勇的卫国战士！
    全国武装起义时，斯大林元帅立即调动柏林前线的第一乌克兰前线部队来驰援，这样，在五月九日，捷克全境解放。
    解放后的捷克，成立了全国性的民主联合政府，以贝奈斯为总统，哥特瓦尔德为总理。一九四六年第一次的国会大选中，共产党得百分之三十九的选票。
            二
    共产党领导全国建设劳动人民自己的国家是在极端尖锐的阶级斗争中进行的。捷克劳动人民不但在胡斯革命、反奥匈统治、反希特勒的奴役的伟大革命中，而且在建设与巩固人民民主政权的过程中，一贯地表现出伟大无敌的革命力量。自捷克人民国家建立后，英美帝国主义及其代理人国内的资产阶级就百般地进行、破坏和间谍活动，企图颠覆年青的共和国，以恢复旧的资产阶级的血腥统治。轰动世界的二月事件，就是这反动阴谋的最露骨最集中的表现。
    一九四八年二月十九日，反动派的政党——国家社会党、人民党、斯洛伐克民主党三党的十二个部长借口内政部改组国家保安兵团的措施不当，共同提出辞职，意图把共产党赶出去。第二天，布拉格举行盛大的群众示威游行，二十四日全国举行总罢工以表示人民的抗议。经过五天犹豫，贝奈斯总统看到了人民坚决反对那些反动的政党的政变阴谋，乃批准了反动部长们的辞呈。二月事件遂以革命力量之胜利宣告结束。
    二月事件后，民族阵线内的反动派被清洗了，这样就改变了以前国内阶级力量的对比，给国内外的反动势力以致命的打击。
    一九四八年五月九日颁布了新宪法。宪法宣告与保证解放了的捷克斯洛伐克向和平、富强、自由、平等的前途迈进。对国家的性质、政权机构的组织、人民的权利与义务和对政治经济社会制度所已发生的基本变化在宪法上得到法律的认可。
    民族委员会在一九四三年下半季先后在各省、区、村成立，在那时是领导反对法西斯及叛国者的斗争组织。解放后，民族委员会是新民主政权的重要支持者。一九四九年一月，全国改组地方政权，贩消过去庞大的省民族委员会官僚机构，而改分成州、区、村三级的民族委员会。
    二月事件后不久即举行全国国会大选。选举结果，共产党所领导的民族阵线得百分之八十九点二的选票。在工人区域中百分之九十七到九十九的选民都投票拥护民族阵线。这足可证明捷共所领导的新的民族阵线是如何取得人民的信任。一九四八年六月初，贝奈斯辞职，国会一致选举哥特瓦尔德为总统。
            三
    捷克斯洛伐克人民在政治上反对反动派斗争取得胜利，在经济建设方面同样地获得了辉煌的成绩。
    人民政府在解放后不久实行土地改革及国有化法令，资产阶级曾经竭力阻挠与破坏这些民主改革。直到二月事件以后，这些民主改革才彻底实现。
    经过第二次国有化法令与再次修正的土地改革法令，国家对经济中的资本主义因素的限制已有显著的成绩；除已将外资及大资产阶级的矿山、银行、保险公司、动力、冶金、军火和化学等工业收归国有外，更将雇用五千人以上的企业、批发业与国外贸易国有化。至今，百分之九十八的工业，百分之百的运输业，批发业及国外贸易，百分之八十以上的建筑业都已属国家所有。至于土地改革，现在除已没收德国人及前匈牙利地主贵族以及卖国贼的土地和财产外，并把土地持有者五十公顷以上的土地由国家收买，分配给无地或少地的农民。目前已进一步分配土地，实行耕者有其田。国有化的结果，不仅保证了国营经济在国民经济的领导作用，而且使经济计划的实行成为可能。土地改革的结果，则摧毁了封建势力，满足了农民的土地要求，并且解决了捷克人民对德匈贵族大地主的长久仇恨。
    一九四七年到一九四八年恢复经济的二年计划的目标是要超过战前工业水准百分之十，并使落后的斯洛伐克工业化。一九四八年十月两年计划完成时，总生产量完成百分之一百零一，个别工业的产量，如果以一九三七年为一百，则矿产为一百十三点三，动力为一百八十三点九，金属为一百十七点八，化学品为一百二十四，皮革及橡胶为一百十二点一，建筑材料为一百十七点五。农业由于一九四七年严重的旱灾与怠工而未完成。两年计划的一个最大的收获就是斯洛伐克的工业化。二年计划的胜利完成，奠定了自一九四九年到一九五三年的五年计划的基础。
    五年计划的完成，将进一步提高城乡劳动人民的生活水准，并奠立社会主义的基础。五年计划要改变捷克的经济机构，使重工业的发展超过轻工业，即重工业占工业生产量百分之六十，轻工业占百分之四十。计划完成时，国民收入比一九四八年增加百分之五十，工业总产量将提高百分之五十七，农产品将增加百分之十五。五年计划要使农业机械化与电气化，并最后地完成集体农场。一九四九年五年计划第一年总生产量完成计划百分之一百零二点八。
    现在捷克全境乞丐已绝迹，全国无一失业者。工人的实际工资去年又比二年计划完成时增加百分之二十，配给制取消了，社会保险较战前增加了两倍，教育经费增加三倍。
    国家的预算可以反映一个国家的经济制度。一九四九年捷克政府的预算不但没有赤字，而且还有三亿五千万克郎（捷币）的盈余。去年工业生产投资为预算中最大的一项，社会福利占百分之二十六点三，文教占百分之十一点九，国防仅占百分之九。而美国的预算中文教只占百分之二，国防却占百分之六十。这是一个深刻的对照。
    由于强大的社会主义苏联的存在和她的兄弟般的援助，使捷克人民从德国的奴役下解放出来，并避免了外国帝国主义的干涉。捷克人民在共产党主席哥特瓦尔德总统的领导下，正向自由、幸福、灿烂的社会主义大道迈进。
