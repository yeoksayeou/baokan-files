　　【Kaifeng News】According to the Henan Daily news: Since the end of the land reform in Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, various representative meetings have been held continuously to widely publicize production policies. The production enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers has been unprecedentedly high. Of the county's more than 600,000 mu of wheat fields (accounting for about 70% of the total cultivated area), except for a small amount of late-planted wheat that is not suitable for hoeing, they have generally been hoed once, weeded once, and rolled once. More than 30% of the land has been hoed twice and weeded twice. Most of the wheat fields have also been given additional spring fertilizer. Especially after the widespread spring rains, the wheat is growing even more vigorously, and the fields are a lush green. Barley has begun to head, and broad beans have generally blossomed, and wheat is forming ears. Farmers generally reflect: "This year's wheat is growing better than in previous years, and there are no weeds in the fields. This is thanks to the implementation of land reform." Farmers in Lizhuang District said: "This year's wheat is growing better than in previous years because we have been allocated land, and we have the energy to work, hoeing, weeding, and applying top dressing. Looking at the way it is growing now, we can harvest more than 10% more than in previous years." The newly emancipated farmers often say to the lush and fertile wheat: "This is the blessing given by Chairman Mao!"

　　襄城土地改革后农民生产热情高
    【开封讯】据河南日报消息：河南省襄城县自从土地改革结束以后，连续召开了各种代表会，普遍的宣传生产政策，广大农民生产热情空前高涨，全县六十余万亩的麦田（占总耕地面积百分之七十左右），除去了少数晚种的麦子不宜修锄外，普遍的作到锄一遍、?一遍、碾一遍。其中百分之三十以上的作到锄两遍、?两遍。大部分麦地均追加春肥。特别在普降春雨之后，麦子更见茁壮，田野一片油绿，大麦已开始吐穗，扁豆也普遍的开了花，小麦结苞。农民普遍反映：“今年的麦子比往年长的都好，地里也没有草。这幸亏是实行了土地改革。”李庄区的农民说：“今年麦子长的比往年好，这是因为分了土地，做着有劲，又锄又?又上了追粪。看现在长的样子比往年多打一成还能超过。”新翻身的农民们常常对着油绿肥壮的麦子说：“这是毛主席给的福啊！”
