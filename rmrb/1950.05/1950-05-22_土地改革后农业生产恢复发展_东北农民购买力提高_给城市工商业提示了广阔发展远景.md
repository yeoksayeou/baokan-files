Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 21st—The increased purchasing power of 30 million farmers in Northeast China after land reform has provided broad development prospects for urban industry and commerce. The total value of farmers' purchasing power in Northeast China last year was equivalent to 3.34 million tons of sorghum. This year, it is estimated to reach 5.66 million tons, an increase of nearly 70 percent compared to last year.
Due to the recovery and development of agricultural production after the land reform, the demand of farmers in Northeast China for means of production has rapidly increased. In January and February of this year, the Harbin Rural Service Cooperative helped rural cooperatives purchase new and old farm tools worth more than 1.28 billion Northeast Yuan. The hardware and carpentry business in Dongfeng County, Liaodong Province, is booming, with supply falling short of demand. The city's 13 private blacksmith shops mainly produce farm tools and horseshoes. Last winter, the average daily transaction volume increased by 100% compared with the winter of the previous year. The number of carpentry shops has also increased from 22 to 28, of which 15 making carts have the best business.

Similarly, the demands of farmers in Northeast China for consumer goods have also increased compared to the past. In 1948, farmers only needed white homespun cloth and salt, but this year they are no longer satisfied with 8.5 jin per bolt of white cloth, and are demanding 10.5 jin per bolt of fine cloth and printed cloth. During the puppet Manchukuo period, the rural population could not even get an average of five chi of cloth per person per year. This year, according to the farmers' purchasing power, each person can get an average of 20 chi of cloth. According to a report by the Harbin Rural Survey Team, 60 percent of the farmers in Feiketu District of Acheng County and Yuanbao Village of Shangzhi County, Songjiang Province, wore new cotton-padded clothes last winter. In Jixing Village, Xinmin District, Feiketu District, only two of Li Wenju's family of six poor peasants wore semi-old cotton-padded jackets; all six members of the middle peasant Nan Haiyun's family wore new clothes.

The increase in farmers' purchasing power is mainly due to the general economic rise of farmers after the land reform, in addition to the relatively lower prices of industrial products compared to agricultural products. After two or three years of production campaigns after land reform in the northern Manchurian provinces, the proportion of farmers whose living standards rose accounted for 60 to 70 percent in Songjiang Province, about 65 percent in Jilin Province, and 54 percent in Heilongjiang Province, which was more significant. In Liaodong Province, a new area, after one year of production movement after land reform, 33.5 percent of farmers have improved their lives. Under this new situation, the amount of grain as a commodity is increasing day by day. According to statistics from Sanhetun, Yushu County, Jilin Province, the average annual income per person is more than three dan of grain (one dan is 500 jin). A family of five can sell or exchange half of the grain for living and production materials, in addition to food, fodder, and public grain. Subsidiary products are also increasing, and subsidiary income generally accounts for 15 to 20 percent of agricultural income.

Due to the increase in farmers' purchasing power, the demand for means of production and daily necessities in rural Northeast China will greatly expand this year compared to last year. In addition to planning to expand state-owned industry, the Northeast People's Government is encouraging the development of private industry to meet the needs of farmers.

　　土地改革后农业生产恢复发展
    东北农民购买力提高 
    给城市工商业提示了广阔发展远景
    【新华社沈阳二十一日电】东北三千万农民土地改革后购买力的提高，给城市工商业提供了广阔发展的远景。去年东北农民购买力的总值，折合高粱三百三十四万吨，今年预计可以达到五百六十六万吨，即较去年提高将近百分之七十。
    由于土地改革后农业生产的恢复和发展，东北农民对生产资料的需求迅速增加。哈尔滨市农村服务社在今年一、二月份，帮助农村合作社购买新式和旧式农具的金额，达东北流通券十二亿八千多万元。辽东省东丰县城区铁木业生意兴隆，供不应求。全城私营铁匠炉十三户，主要生产农具、马掌，去冬交易额平均每天比前年冬季增加一倍；木匠铺亦由二十二家增至二十八家，其中尤以十五家制造大车者生意最好。
    同样的，东北农民对生活资料的要求也较过去增多了。一九四八年时，农民只要有白土布和食盐就行，而今年他们已经不满足于八斤半一匹的白布，而要求十斤半一匹的细布和花布。伪满时期，农村人口每人每年平均还摊不上五尺布。今年按照农民的购买力，每人平均已可得到二十尺布。据哈尔滨农村调查组的报告，松江省阿城县蜚克图区和尚志县元宝村的农民，去年冬天百分之六十穿上了新棉衣。蜚克图区新民村吉兴屯贫农李文举家六口人中只有两个人穿半旧棉袄；中农南海云家六口人则全部穿上了新衣服。
    农民购买力的提高，除了由于工业品价格比农业品价格相对地降低外，主要是由于土地改革后一般农民经济普遍上升。北满各省农民在土地改革后，经过两三年的生产运动，松江省农户上升者占百分之六十到七十，吉林省占百分之六十五左右，黑龙江省上升比较显著的有百分之五十四。新区辽东省土地改革后，经过一年的生产运动，亦已有百分之三十三点五的农民生活上升了。在这种新情况下，作为商品的粮食就日益增多起来。据吉林省榆树县三合屯的统计，全年每人可平均收入粮食三石（一石五百斤）多，五口之家，除了人吃、喂马、缴公粮等外，可有一半粮食出卖或交换生活与生产资料。副业产品也随着增多，副业收入，一般可占农业收入的百分之十五到二十。
    由于农民购买力的提高，今年东北农村对生产资料和生活必需品的要求，将较去年大大扩展。东北人民政府除计划扩大公营工业外，正鼓励私营工业发展以满足农民的需求。
