　　This is a Just Resolution
　　The Soviet People Support and Respond to the Appeal
　　Firmly Believe the Peace Front Will Surely Triumph
    [Report from this newspaper] According to the Dalian Truth Daily, the Soviet Peace Committee receives many letters from various places every day. The Soviet people—representatives of workers, farmers, and intellectuals—enthusiastically support the activities of peace advocates around the world in these letters. They are all wholeheartedly signing the Stockholm meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace's appeal for the prohibition of atomic weapons. In their letters, the Soviet people express their intention to actively struggle to win peace and stop every action of the instigators of new wars.
    Volosha Hanskaya from Stalin City, Ukraine, wrote in her letter: When I wrote to the Soviet Peace Committee, explaining my loyal support for the appeal on banning atomic weapons and considering the government that first uses atomic weapons to be a war criminal, I believed that I could express the feelings of women throughout the Soviet Union. The struggle of Soviet women for peace is closely related to the struggle of all progressive humanity for freedom and happiness. Ordinary people oppose war; only imperialists need war. However, there are hundreds of thousands of people in our ranks of peace supporters, while they are only a small minority. Therefore, I believe in the triumph of the cause of peace.
    A former serviceman from the last war, living in Ukraine, wrote in a letter to the Soviet Peace Committee: We are participants in the heroic struggle of the Soviet people against fascist Germany. We respond to the appeal of the Third Plenary Session of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace and enthusiastically support the resolution of this meeting to declare the government that first uses atomic weapons a war criminal. This is a just resolution, a stern warning to the warmongers. We signed this appeal. We prescribe the following disgraceful names for the instigators of war: "Enemies of Peace," "War Criminals," "Warmongers." We believe that these people's sinful acts against peace must be widely communicated to world public opinion, prescribing the punishment they deserve before the people. We, the ordinary people of the Soviet Union, have all signed the appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. We call on all loyal people around the world to carry out an active struggle to win peace and oppose war. There are hundreds of millions of members in our peace-loving ranks, so we believe that if we work hard, the powerful peace front will surely triumph.

　　这是正义的决议
　　苏联人民拥护和大呼吁书         
　　坚信和平阵线一定能胜利
    【本报讯】据大连实话报消息：苏联拥护和平委员会每天都从各地收到许多书信。苏联人民——工人、农民与知识分子的代表，在这些书信中热烈地拥护全世界拥护和平人士的活动，他们都全心全意的在世界拥护和平大会常设委员会斯德哥尔摩会议关于禁用原子武器的呼吁书上签字。苏联人民在自己的信中表示将去进行积极斗争，以争取和平，阻止新战争挑拨者们的每一行动。
    乌克兰斯大林城伏罗沙汉斯卡娅在自己的信中写道：当我给苏联拥护和平委员会写信，说明我忠实拥护关于禁用原子武器和认为首先使用原子武器的那个政府为战犯的呼吁书时，我相信能够表达出苏联全国妇女们的心情的，苏联妇女们争取和平，是同一切进步人类为自由、幸福的斗争息息相关的。普通人反对战争，只有帝国主义者才需要战争。但是，我们的拥护和平队伍中有成万的人们，而他们却只是一小撮。因此，我相信和平事业的凯旋。
    住在乌克兰境内的前次战争的军人，给苏联拥护和平委员会的信中写道：我们是苏联人民与法西斯德国英勇斗争的参加者。我们响应世界拥护和平大会常设委员会第三次全会的呼吁书，热烈拥护这一会议关于宣布首先使用原子武器的那个政府为战犯的决议，这是正义的决议，这个决议是给战争贩子一个严厉警告。我们签署了这一呼吁书。我们给战争挑拨者们规定以下这样耻辱罪名：“和平的敌人”、“战犯”、“战争贩子”。我们认为，必须把这些人反对和平的罪恶行为广泛地转达给世界舆论，规定他们在人民面前应得的惩罚。我们苏联的普通人都签署了世界拥护和平大会常设委员会的呼吁书。我们号召全世界一切忠诚的人们进行积极的斗争，来争取和平反对战争。我们拥护和平的队伍中，有数万万的成员，因此我们相信，如果我们努力，强大的和平阵线一定会取得胜利。
