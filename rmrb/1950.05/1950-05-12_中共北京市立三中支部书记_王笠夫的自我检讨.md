　　Self-Criticism of Wang Lifu, Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Beijing No. 3 Middle School Branch

　　The land originally allocated to Beijing No. 3 Middle School was in the western suburbs, very close to the school. Later, it was changed to the eastern suburbs. The students' enthusiasm for production fluctuated. Among the boarding students in the senior year, a few were unwilling to participate in production. At that time, I was very impatient and rashly proposed at the school production meeting: "Boarding students must participate in production," which caused dissatisfaction among the boarding students. Comrade Zhang Xuezeng, a Party member, reflected the above situation and pointed out to me that forcing production was wrong. Not only did I fail to review this, but I also associated it with the fact that senior year students have always been undisciplined, and said, "What kind of coercion is this? The old liberated areas even reformed loafers!" Therefore, I failed to pay attention to Comrade Zhang Xuezeng's opinion. Zhang then submitted his opinion in writing, opposing forced production, and stated that if I disagreed, he hoped his written opinion would be submitted to the Municipal Party Committee. I kept Zhang's opinion letter for five days, and only handed it over when the academic branch of the Municipal Party Committee came to ask for it.

　　Now I have realized that I made two mistakes: First, forcing students to participate in production. This is completely inconsistent with the Party's policy. The Party calls on students to voluntarily engage in labor and production to improve their lives. Although I did not continue this kind of coercion afterward, I made such a decision at the production meeting, and it has already caused dissatisfaction among the students, so I made the mistake of forcing students to participate in production. Second, I withheld the opinion letter that Comrade Zhang Xuezeng, a Party member, requested to be submitted to the Municipal Party Committee. This reflects my lack of understanding of intra-Party democracy, my failure to value the opinions of student Party members, and even my forgetting of the Party Constitution's stipulation that Party members have the right to make suggestions, statements, and complaints to the Party's leading organs, and that Party committees at all levels must promptly convey these without delay.

　　Comrade Shang Kai, a reporter from the People's Daily, reported my above mistakes, and the academic branch of the Organization Department of the Municipal Party Committee also had several conversations with me, but I still failed to accept their criticism. I thought that the academic branch used to believe the opinions of student Party members and did not believe the opinions of an old Party member like me; I thought that Comrade Shang Kai deliberately made things difficult for me. I focused on nitpicking at individual discrepancies in the article he wrote. I used the excuse of being afraid of losing leadership prestige and was unwilling to admit my mistakes. I also publicly said at a mass meeting: "Comrade Shang Kai's report has discrepancies with the facts, and I don't have time to engage in a war of words with reporters." As a result, I damaged the credibility of the Party newspaper among the masses, and I committed a third and even more serious mistake.

　　The root cause of my mistakes this time is that I usually lack serious study and research on the Party's policies and theories, I am accustomed to and satisfied with the old experience and style of work, I am stubborn and self-opinionated, and I lack the spirit of self-criticism. This is a reflection of petty-bourgeois ideology, putting personal prestige and reputation above the interests of the Party. Now that I have recognized these mistakes, and I am a Communist Party member, I must be determined to correct them.

### 中共北京市立三中支部书记　王笠夫的自我检讨

　　中共北京市立三中支部书记
　　王笠夫的自我检讨
    北京市立三中的土地原来分配在西郊，距离学校很近。后来改为东郊。学生生产情绪发生了波动。高三住宿生中，少数不愿参加生产，我当时很急躁，便粗率地在学校生产会议上提出：“住宿生必须参加生产”，因而引起住宿学生不满。党员章学曾同志反映了上述情况，并向我提出强迫生产是不对的。我不仅未能加以检讨，反联想到高三学生向来自由散漫，并说：“这算甚么强迫，老区还改造二流子呢？”因而未能重视章学曾同志的意见。章又以书面向我提出反对强迫生产的意见，并声明如不同意，希将他的书面意见送交市委。而我则将章的意见书存放五日，直到市委学支科来索取始交出。
    现在我已经认识到我犯了两个错误：首先是强迫学生参加生产。这是完全不符合党的政策的。党是号召学生自愿去劳动生产，以改善自己的生活，虽然以后我并未继续此种强迫行为，但我既在生产会议上作了这样的决定，而且已经引起学生不满，所以我是犯了强迫学生参加生产的错误。其次是扣留了党员章学曾同志要求提交给市委的意见书。这反映我对党内民主缺乏认识，不重视学生党员的意见，甚至忘了党章的规定：党员有向党的领导机关建议、声明及控诉的权利，各级党委均必须迅速转达，不得稽留。
    人民日报记者商恺同志报道了我的上述错误，市委组织部学支科亦和我作了多次谈话，我仍未能接受他们的批评。我认为学支科过去相信学生党员的意见，而不相信我一个老党员的意见；我认为商恺同志有意与我为难。我着重挑剔他所写的文章中个别与事实稍有出入的地方。我以怕丧失领导威信为借口，不愿承认错误。我并在群众大会上公开说：“商恺同志的报道与事实有出入，我没有时间与记者打笔仗。”因而在群众中损害了党报的威信，并使我又犯了第三个更严重的错误。
    我这次犯错误的根源是平时对党的政策和理论缺乏认真的学习和研究，习惯并满足于旧的经验作风，固执己见，缺乏自我批评的精神。这是小资产阶级思想的反映，把个人威信名誉看得比党的利益更大。我既认识到这些错误，我又是共产党员，就一定要下决心改正。
