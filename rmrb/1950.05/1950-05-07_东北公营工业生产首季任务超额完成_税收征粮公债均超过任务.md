Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 5th: The total output value of factories and mines under the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government exceeded the plan by 9.21% in the first quarter of this year. The total value of these products has reached 24.5% of the annual plan, exceeding the original plan (to complete 20% of this year's target) by 4.5%. This achievement has created favorable conditions for completing the annual plan. Among the thirteen larger production systems under the Industrial Department of the Northeast People's Government, the Light Industry Bureau, Non-Ferrous Metals Bureau, Fushun Coal Mine Bureau, Construction Industry Bureau, and Northeast Coal Mine Bureau all exceeded the plan by more than 20%. Looking at twenty-five major products, twenty of them have completed their tasks.

There were also three relatively serious shortcomings in the overall production of the first quarter, namely: (1) The quality of many products was very low. The worst example is that 100% of the lathes produced by the First Machine Factory were substandard. Only 68% of the light bulbs produced by the bulb factory were合格 [hé gé - up to standard]. Due to the large number of defective products, the state property suffered huge losses. (2) The phenomenon of lax production discipline is still very serious. The responsibility system has not yet been implemented; technical, operational, and safety regulations have not yet been mastered by the masses; and attendance rates have been neglected in setting plans and quotas. According to a one-day statistic, the absenteeism rate was 7.5%. (3) There were particularly many accidents in the first quarter's production, especially in January and February. The power system had three or four hundred accidents; a single accident with the blower in the coking plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company resulted in a loss of 80 billion Northeast currency. Therefore, the Northeast industrial and mining departments have decided to seriously establish and implement the responsibility system and inspection system in the second quarter, and formulate strict technical and safety regulations in order to quickly correct the serious shortcomings in the first quarter's production.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 4th: Northeast China has basically completed its fiscal revenue target for the first quarter of this year, with tax revenue, grain procurement, and public bond issuance all exceeding the targets. Tax revenue exceeded the original plan by 44.4%; 19.8 million shares of public bonds have been actually sold, accounting for 116.47% of the total issuance of 17 million shares; and the actual grain collected exceeded the target by 210,000 tons. In addition, special sales revenue and other items have also completed their plans as scheduled. The overfulfillment of the tax revenue target is mainly due to the importance attached to this work by cadres at all levels, and the absorption of Dalian's experience, organizing industrialists and businessmen, implementing a special responsibility system for tax personnel, conducting in-depth inspections, and breaking through false accounts. However, there are still some shortcomings in tax work, such as the failure to properly address the tax payment issues of publicly owned enterprises; the lack of familiarity with the overall business and economic situation of industry and commerce in Northeast China, and the insufficient control of tax sources. Therefore, how to conduct in-depth investigations, grasp tax sources, break through false accounts, plug loopholes, implement a special responsibility system, and overcome complacency are major issues in future tax work.

The only item in the first quarter's fiscal revenue that did not complete the target was the profit and depreciation fee submitted by publicly owned enterprises, which only completed 68% of the original plan. The reason is that the profit submission plan for publicly owned enterprises in the first quarter was estimated and formulated before the annual plans of the various enterprise units were made, and the plans of some units were not accurate enough; in addition, the profits of some industrial and mining enterprises have not yet been fully and accurately calculated.

### 东北公营工业生产首季任务超额完成  税收征粮公债均超过任务

　　东北公营工业生产首季任务超额完成
    税收征粮公债均超过任务
    【新华社沈阳五日电】东北人民政府工业部所属各厂矿今年第一季度生产总值超过计划百分之九点二一。这些产品总值已达到全年计划的百分之二十四点五，较原计划（应完成今年的百分之二十）多完成了百分之四点五。这一成绩已为完成全年计划创造了有利的条件。在东北人民政府工业部所属的十三个较大的生产系统中，轻工业局、有色金属局、抚顺煤矿局、建筑工业局、东北煤矿局等超过计划均在百分之二十以上。如以二十五种主要产品来看，亦有二十种完成了任务。
    第一季整个生产中亦有三个比较严重的缺点，即：（一）许多产品质量很低。最坏的例子，如第一机器厂生产的车床百分之百不合格。灯泡厂的电灯泡只有百分之六十八合格。由于废品很多，国家财产遭受了巨大的损失。（二）生产纪律松懈的现象还很严重。责任制尚未贯彻；技术、操作、保安等规程尚未为群众所掌握；在订计划与规定定额中忽视了出勤率。据一天的统计：缺勤率即为百分之七点五。（三）在第一季生产中事故特别多，尤以一、二两月最为严重。电业系统发生了三、四百次事故；鞍山钢铁公司炼焦厂鼓风机一次事故即损失东北币八百亿元。为此，东北各工矿部门决定在第二季中认真建立与贯彻责任制和检查制度，制订严格的技术和保安规程，以求迅速改正第一季生产中的严重缺点。
    【新华社沈阳四日电】东北今年第一季度的财政收入已基本完成，其中税收、征粮以及公债发行均超过任务。计税收超过原计划的百分之四十四点四；公债已实销一千九百八十万分，为发行总额一千七百万分的百分之一百一十六点四七；公粮实收超过任务二十一万吨。此外，专卖收入等也如期完成了计划。税收任务的超额完成，主要是由于各级干部的重视这一工作，并吸收了大连的经验，把工商业家组织起来，实行税务人员专责制，深入检查，突破假账。但税收工作仍存在着一些缺点，如对公营企业的纳税问题迄今尚未作好；对整个东北工商业营业、经济情况还不熟悉，掌握税源也还不够。因此，如何深入调查，掌握税源，突破假账，堵塞偷漏，实行工作专责制，克服自满情绪等，是今后税务工作中的重大问题。
    第一季财政收入中唯一未完成任务的是公营企业利润和折旧费的解缴，只完成了原定计划的百分之六十八，其原因是由于第一季度公营企业利润解缴计划是在各企业单位全年计划作出前估计制订的，有些单位的计划本身就不够准确；另外，有的工矿企业利润尚未全部确实计算出来。
