　　Another Crime of Persecution of Democrats by Bidault
    Director of the French National Center for Scientific Research, Teissier, Dismissed by the French Government
    [Report from this newspaper] According to reports from Paris: Georges Teissier, Director of the French National Center for Scientific Research, was dismissed by the French Bidault government in April. Teissier is a famous French mineralogist, a member of the French Communist Party, and a professor at the University of Paris, who has served as the director of the National Center for Scientific Research since 1946. He has always been an active participant in the French democratic and peace movement.
    Note: The National Center for Scientific Research (Centre National de Recherches Scientifiques) is a French national institution that funds natural scientists (including foreign students working with achievements) in their research. Researchers are classified into several categories based on their abilities and achievements, and are awarded varying amounts of research grants. It also has library facilities to facilitate the use of research workers. In addition to funding, the "Center" also has many research units directly under it. In short, the researchers funded and managed by the "Center" account for half of all of France. The "Center" originated from a fund in 1935 and was renamed the "Center" in 1939. The first director was Madame Curie-Joliot. It was taken over by the puppet government during the German occupation. After the war, the first director was Joliot-Curie. In 1946, Joliot-Curie was transferred to the Atomic Energy Commission, and Teissier took over as director. Teissier is a professor at the University of Paris, specializing in the study of mineral rocks, and has a high reputation in France. During the underground resistance against Germany, Joliot-Curie served as the chairman of the National Front, and Teissier served as his secretary.

    法国国家研究中心主任戴西野为法政府免职
    【本报讯】据巴黎来信称：法国国家研究中心主任戴西野（GeorgesTeissier）在四月间被法国皮杜尔政府免职。按戴西野是法国著名的矿物学家，法国共产党员，巴黎大学教授，自一九四六年起任国家科学研究中心主任。他一向是法国民主和平运动的积极参加者。
    按：国家科学研究中心（Gentre National de Recherches Scientifiques），是法国国立机构，资助国内（及外国留学工作有成绩的）自然科学工作者从事研究。按研究人员能力成绩分为几种名目，分别赠予多少不等的研究奖金。并设有图书设备，便利研究工作者的利用，除掉资助以外，这“中心”也直属有很多研究单位。总之，由“中心”资助和管辖的研究工作者占全法国之半。“中心”起源于一九三五年的一笔基金，一九三九年改称“中心”，第一位主任是小居礼夫人。德国占领时曾为伪政府接管。战后第一任主任是约里奥——居里，一九四六年约里奥——居里调到原子能委员会，主任由戴西野接任。戴西野是巴黎大学教授，专门研究矿物岩石，在法国国内很有声望。地下抗德时代，约里奥——居里任民族阵线的主席，戴西野任他的秘书。
