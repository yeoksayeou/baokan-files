　　Introduction to "New Countryside" Magazine
　　Chang Dong
    "New Countryside" magazine is distributed by the Northeast Xinhua Bookstore and is intended for reading by district and village cadres. However, it also holds significant educational value for cadres above the county level, as well as revolutionary intellectuals and agricultural researchers. Its characteristic features are its popular style, conciseness, and strong connection to policies, achieving a depth of explanation in simple terms.
    In the nineteenth issue, the article "Temporary Teaching Materials for Rural Branches" comprehensively describes the new atmosphere of rural economic construction in the Northeast:
        "After the land reform, rectification, and organized large-scale production, especially after the Northeast region completely
    eliminated the Chiang bandits and underwent more than a year of economic construction, the appearance of the entire Northeast countryside has been completely renewed.
    This is because about 50% of farmers in various regions have risen to the level of middle peasants (60% in Songjiang, 54% in Longjiang, two-thirds in Jilin, and a survey of 13 villages in nine counties of Liaodong shows a significant increase of 33.5%). Even those who have not risen to the level of middle peasants have seen improvements in their production conditions and living standards compared to before the land reform or last year, becoming wealthier. The wealth of farmers has generally increased significantly. The conditions for rural reproduction have a more solid foundation."
    Urban-rural exchange has also given farmers tremendous benefits, starting to change the unreasonable scissor price gap between industrial and agricultural products. The outlets for agricultural products have increased, specialized crops have recovered, a large number of sideline occupations have prospered, and rural purchasing power has increased. For example, according to a survey in Yushu County, in October 1947, one dou (48-50 jin) of soybeans could be exchanged for one chi of cloth, in December 1948 for two and a half chi of cloth, and this year it is five and a half to six chi of fine blue cloth."
    Developing production is the overriding task, and organizing and enabling labor to help each other and change work, thereby increasing labor productivity, is the most effective and promising method. However, organization must be based entirely on the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit, and farmers must realize the benefits of organized production before they can truly be organized. The above article uses very concise and profound words to explain this principle to farmers:
        "'Is individual farming okay?' The question is not whether individual farming is 'okay' or 'not okay,' but whether '
    individual farming' is better or 'joint teams' are better? We believe that organizing is definitely better than individual farming. If you insist on individual farming, that's okay, let's compare and see which one produces more grain and which one develops faster?"
    Where is organized production better than individual households working alone? This magazine also provides a lot of specific materials. For example, in a material from the Mingshui County Party Committee, it reported that two farmers in the second village of the sixth district of Mingshui, Shi Fucai, joined a mutual aid group, while Ma Hongsheng farmed individually. Shi Fucai averaged six shi of soybeans per hectare, while Ma Hongsheng only harvested three shi and five dou. Shi Fucai averaged two shi and four dou of wheat per hectare, while Ma Hongsheng only harvested one shi and nine dou. Shi Fucai averaged six shi of corn per hectare, while Ma Hongsheng only harvested a little over three shi. Shi Fucai averaged six shi of millet per hectare, while Ma Hongsheng only harvested two shi and nine dou.
    Mobilizing farmers to organize into cooperatives, to connect urban and rural relations, reduce merchant exploitation, and help agricultural and sideline production, is also an equally important issue. The 21st issue of the journal, "Temporary Teaching Materials for Rural Branches," pointed out that the tasks of the cooperative are:
        "The cooperative should also organize and promote rural sideline production. This is not only to help farmers sell their sideline products, but also to develop various sideline industries that have local production conditions, to organize those
    surplus laborers in agricultural production (such as during slack seasons, surplus labor) and those who cannot cultivate the land but have not completely lost their labor power (such as various semi-laborers, people with various physical defects) into production, to develop this kind of production. The cooperative can also adopt methods such as supplying raw materials, setting the price for finished products, and paying wages."
        "The cooperative should also organize agricultural improvement projects that individual households and groups cannot carry out and complete independently, such as building small-scale water conservancy projects, purchasing new agricultural tools, promoting the use of improved seeds, eliminating pests, and preventing livestock epidemics."
        "The cooperative should also carry out deposit-taking to help farmers save. The rural idle funds collected in this way can be collectively invested in production, or lent at low interest rates to households that temporarily encounter production difficulties."
    The 19th issue of the journal, in the article "How to Run Supply and Marketing Cooperatives Well Under the New Guidelines," also explains the rationale for why supply and marketing cooperatives should not distribute dividends in a similarly concise and delightful manner:
        "If our cadres can think carefully: Is it more beneficial for the members if you try to make more money all the time in order to give them more dividends, or is it more beneficial for the members if you try your best to solve their difficulties in supply and marketing, that is, let them buy things conveniently and save money, and have outlets for their products, thus increasing the income of the members? At the same time, we must also think: If we focus only on distributing dividends, we will inevitably try to make more money. Where does the money come from? Isn't it earned from the members! Isn't it earned by suppressing the prices of the members' products and raising the prices of the goods sold!"
    Currently, the style of forced command, paternalistic substitution, and detachment from the masses among local cadres in various regions is quite serious. This journal has also collected many rich examples and put forward many correct and concise methods. It also often uses fresh and clear language to express profound theories on issues such as convening people's representative conferences, establishing rural youth leagues, promoting rural cultural and educational movements, publicizing the construction of public bonds, and issuing production loans. In short, this is a good magazine that adheres to policies, implements policies, combines with practical problems, and solves practical problems.

### 介绍《新农村》杂志

　　介绍《新农村》杂志
　　长冬
    《新农村》杂志是东北新华书店发行，供区村干部阅读的，但它对于县以上干部以及革命知识分子、农业研究者也都有很大的教育意义。它的特色是通俗、简明、联系政策强，做到了深入浅出。
    在第十九期《农村支部临时教材》这篇文章中，概括地叙述了目前东北农村经济建设的新气象：
        “经过土改、纠偏、组织起来大生产之后，特别是在东北区经过全部
    消灭蒋匪，一年多的经济建设之后，全东北农村的样子已经完全一新了。
    这就是各地百分之五十左右的农户上升到中农（松江百分之六十，龙江百
    分之五十四，吉林是三分之二，辽东九县十三个村的调查，显著上升的有
    百分之三三·五），即使那些没上升到中农的人家，无论从生产条件、生
    活状况来说，也都比土改之前或比去年是改善了，富裕些了。农民的财富
    一般的都有显著的增加。农村再生产的条件，是更有优良基础了。”
    城乡的交流也给了农民极大的利益，开始改变了工农业产品的不合理的剪刀价格差，农产品的出路增加，特种农作物恢复，大量的副业兴旺，农村购买力提高等等：“如根据榆树县调查，一九四七年十月大豆一斗“四八——五○斤）换布一尺，一九四八年十二月换布二尺半，而今年则是换青细布五尺半到六尺。”
    发展生产是超过一切的任务，而组织起来，使劳动力互助变工，提高劳动生产力，乃是最有效果、最有发展前途的办法。但组织起来是必须要完全根据自愿两利的原则，必须使农民体会到组织起来生产的好处，然后才能真正组织起来的，上面的这篇文章，用非常简明而深刻的话向农民说出了这个道理：
        “‘单干行吗？’问题不在于单干‘行’还是‘不行’，而是在于‘
    单干’好呢，还是‘联组’好呢？我们认为组织起来一定比单干好，你若
    一定愿意单干，那也可以，咱们比一比看，那个打粮多，那家发展快？”
    组织起来生产比一家一户单干好在什么地方呢？这本杂志又提供了不少具体材料，例如明水县委一篇材料中，报导明水六区二村两个农民，石福财加入互助组，马洪生单干，石福财平均每垧大豆地收六石，马洪生只收三石五，石福财平均一垧小麦地收两石四，马洪生只收一石九，石福财平均一垧苞米收六石，马洪生只收三石多一点，石福财平均一垧谷子收六石，马洪生只收二石九斗。
    动员农民组织在合作社里，以沟通城乡关系，减轻商人剥削，帮助农副业生产，也是同样重要的问题。二十一期该志“农村支部临时教材”中指出了合作社的任务是：
        “合作社还要组织、推动农村的副业生产，这不仅是帮助农民推销他
    们的副业产品，而且，还要展开各种当地具有生产条件的副业，要把那些
    农业生产上剩余的劳动力（如农闲，多余的劳力）及那些虽不能种地但还
    没完全丧失劳动力的人（如各种半劳力，各种身体有缺欠的人）都组织到
    生产中去，来开展这种生产。合作社也可采用供给原料定收成品，支付工
    资的办法。”
        “合作社还要组织各户各组所不能单独进行和完成的农业改良事业，
    如兴修小规模的水利，购买新式农具，进行优良籽种推广，扑灭害虫，牲
    畜防疫等。”
        “合作社还要进行给利存款，来帮助农民储蓄，这样收集的农村游资
    ，一方面可把它集体的投入生产，也可低利贷给临时发生生产困难的各户
    。”
    十九期该志在《在新方针下，怎样办好供销合作社》一文中，又同样简明可喜地说明了供销合作社不应该分红的道理：
        “如果我们干部能很好的想一想：你时时刻刻为了多赚钱，好给社员
    多分些红，这对社员好处大呢？还是在供销上尽力多给社员解决困难，即
    让他们买东西既方便又省钱，生产品有销路，因而增加了社员收入，这样
    对社员好处大呢？同时还要想：专门为了分红，势必想办法多赚钱。钱从
    那里赚来的？这还不是从社员身上赚来的吗！还不是靠买社员的生产品压
    低价格，卖出的货物抬高价格赚来的！”
    目前各地区地方干部中强迫命令、包办代替、脱离群众的作风相当严重，该志也搜集了许多丰富的实例，提出了许多正确简明的办法。他如对召开人民代表会，建立农村青年团，推动农村文教运动，宣传建设公债，发放生产贷款等等，也常常以清新明了的笔墨，说出深刻的理论。总之，这是一种坚持政策、贯彻政策、结合实际问题、解决实际问题的好杂志。
