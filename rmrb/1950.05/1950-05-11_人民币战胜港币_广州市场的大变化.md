RMB Triumphs Over Hong Kong Dollar
	Major Changes in the Guangzhou Market
	By Our Special Correspondent, Xiao Hang

	One of the most difficult problems to deal with after the liberation of Guangzhou was the Hong Kong dollar issue. We had tried many methods to drive out the Hong Kong dollar, but with little effect. It wasn't until after the decision to unify finance and economy this March that prices began to stabilize, and the RMB finally showed its prowess, basically driving the Hong Kong dollar out of Guangzhou. This is a major event in the social life of Guangdong and a milestone in the struggle between the RMB and foreign currencies.

	The triumph of the RMB over the Hong Kong dollar is the main feature of the changes in the Guangzhou market. For decades, Chinese currency, from hao yang, hao silver, hao coupons, Yue coupons, to puppet legal tender, gold yuan coupons, silver dollar coupons, and the ocean coupons issued by the former Guangdong Provincial Bank, had never completely occupied the Guangdong market. The Hong Kong dollar always circulated in both urban and rural areas of Guangdong. Especially between 1948 and 1949, the entire Guangdong market was flooded with Hong Kong dollars. Not only in the major cities, but also in the vast countryside, the Hong Kong dollar became the sole standard currency for pricing. According to statistics released by the Hong Kong Government Statistics Office in September 1949, the amount of Hong Kong dollars issued was 805,345,075, a heavily discounted figure. A closer-to-reality estimate says that the actual amount of Hong Kong dollars issued was over 1.3 billion, with about 700 million circulating in mainland China. Of these, only 12 percent were in East and North China, 88 percent in South China, and 90 percent of South China in Guangdong, with Guangzhou accounting for 80 percent of South China. Calculated in this way, the amount of Hong Kong dollars circulating in Guangdong was as high as 500 million.

	The fundamental reason why the Hong Kong dollar was able to occupy the Guangdong market was the existence of the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang and its long-term malignant inflation. The people did not trust the Kuomintang's currency and believed in the Hong Kong dollar. Other reasons were: First, Guangdong was short of food. According to the earliest survey by the Bank of China, there was a food shortage for eight months of the year. Even now, there is still a food shortage for half the year because the province's cultivated land area accounts for only 15 percent of the total area. A considerable amount of food must be imported every year. According to statistics from 1935 to 1936, the Chaoshan area alone needed to import 200 million jin of grain from Southeast Asia and East China every year. The grain imported from Southeast Asia had to be transshipped through Hong Kong, which created a connection with the Hong Kong dollar. Second, Guangdong's industrial base was weak, and industrial products relied on imports from other places. Imperialist commodity dumping and smuggling made Hong Kong the main source of industrial products and daily necessities for the people of Guangdong. Since Hong Kong did not allow the circulation of Chinese currency, people had to find ways to obtain Hong Kong dollars. As a result, the amount of Hong Kong dollars invading increased year after year.

	Concurrent with the liberation of Guangdong mainland, about 200 million Hong Kong dollars followed the defeated bandit troops, and about 300 million remained in the territory, of which about 200 million flooded the Guangzhou market. Such a quantity of Hong Kong dollars was not only a tool for British imperialism to plunder huge amounts of materials from the people of Guangdong, but also a means for bandits and special agents to stir up trouble and unscrupulous merchants to speculate at the beginning of Guangzhou's liberation. The circulation of the Hong Kong dollar was a major obstacle to the economic recovery of Guangzhou and the entire Guangdong. Therefore, this issue has been a central task since the liberation of Guangzhou.

	Initially, when our banks and trade organizations were not yet widely established, the Guangzhou Military Control Commission issued the No. 1 Golden Character Notice on November 18 last year, allowing the temporary circulation of the Hong Kong dollar, adopting a policy of mainly exclusion, the method was to increase the exchange rate for overseas remittances and lower the exchange rate for the Hong Kong dollar, thereby causing the Hong Kong dollar to flow out. In order to change the public's view of the Hong Kong dollar, the municipal government mobilized more than 20,000 workers and students to carry out extensive propaganda work, which also had some effect. However, the outflow of Hong Kong dollars was extremely slow. On February 3 this year, the Military Control Commission promulgated the No. 2 Golden Character Notice, prohibiting the circulation of the Hong Kong dollar. At this time, the method of dealing with the Hong Kong dollar was mainly through deposit and exchange, on the one hand, continuing to educate the public, and on the other hand, increasing the exchange rate of the Hong Kong dollar, so that Hong Kong dollar holders were happy to deposit and exchange at the bank. After that, the number of deposits and exchanges gradually increased, from several thousand yuan per day to tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even more than one million yuan. However, the number of deposits and exchanges was still far from the amount stored by the people, and the Hong Kong dollar still could not be eliminated. This was mainly because the value of the RMB was unstable, trade companies controlled too few materials, and smuggling was serious. There was still a certain amount of imported materials, and the Hong Kong dollar still had its market.

	However, since the price drop on March 16, the situation has undergone fundamental changes. Now, people can see that the Hong Kong dollar and prices have begun to decouple. We have enough supplies to meet the needs of the market, so the RMB can not only buy things, but also maintain its value. It no longer runs wildly with the Hong Kong dollar's black market, suddenly trading at 7,000 to 1, then 12,000 to 1, causing prices to fluctuate endlessly. Therefore, no matter what fluctuations occur in Hong Kong or London, they will no longer have any impact on the Guangzhou market. The Hong Kong dollar black market has lost its ability to manipulate Guangzhou's prices. To give an example: On March 15, the bank's exchange rate was raised from 4,700 RMB to 1 Hong Kong dollar to 5,200 RMB to 1 Hong Kong dollar. On the 20th, it was changed again to 5,900 RMB to 1 Hong Kong dollar. On the 23rd, it was further increased to 6,150 RMB to 1 Hong Kong dollar. During the same period, the Hong Kong dollar black market not only failed to take the opportunity to fuel the flames and stimulate price increases, but on the contrary, its price continued to decline day by day. By the 27th, the Hong Kong dollar black market had fallen to 6,117 RMB to 1 Hong Kong dollar, 34 RMB lower than the official rate. At the end of April, the official rate was adjusted to 5,900 RMB to 1 Hong Kong dollar, and the black market price remained below 5,900 RMB. Calculated according to the index from March 15 to April 22, the Hong Kong dollar black market price has decreased by 8 percent. In fact, since late March, the bank has always been crowded with people exchanging Hong Kong dollars for RMB, which is an unprecedented phenomenon. The increase in the credibility of the RMB is a fact that everyone can see. Merchants from the countryside who come to Guangzhou to purchase goods see that exchanging Hong Kong dollars for RMB is not a loss. According to a report from the Guangdong Provincial Department of Trade, their "confidence in transactions has greatly increased," and signs of normal exchange of materials between urban and rural areas have begun to emerge. The RMB going to the countryside and eradicating the Hong Kong dollar, the necessary conditions are now in place.

　　人民币战胜港币
    广州市场的大变化
    本报特派记者　萧航
    广州解放后，最难处理的问题之一，是港币问题。为了驱逐港币，我们曾经想了许多办法，但效果均不大。一直到今年三月实行财经统一决定后，物价开始稳定，人民币才大显身手，把港币基本上赶出广州市。这是广东社会生活中一件大事，也是人民币与外币斗争中的一个里程碑。
    人民币战胜港币是广州市场变化的主要特点。几十年来，中国货币从毫洋、毫银、毫券、粤券，到伪法币、金圆券、银元券，以及前广东省银行发行的大洋券，从不曾完全占领过广东市场，港币始终在广东城乡流通着。尤其是一九四八至一九四九年间，整个广东市场，泛滥着清一色的港币，不光是在各大中城市，而且在广大农村，港币成为计价的唯一标准货币。据香港政府统计处一九四九年九月公布，港币的发行额是八亿零五百三十四万五千零七十五元，这是打了一个好大折扣的数字。有一个接近于真实的估计说，港币的实际发行额已有十三亿以上，在我国内地流通的竟达七亿左右。其中华东、华北不过百分之十二，华南占了百分之八十八，而广东又占了华南的百分之九十，广州市则占了华南的百分之八十。这样算，港币在广东的流通量有五亿之巨。
    港币之所以能够盘据广东市场，最基本的原因是国民党反动统治的存在，以及它的长期恶性通货膨胀，人民不相信国民党的货币而相信港币。另外的原因则是：第一，广东缺粮。据最早的中国银行的调查，每年缺八个月的粮食。即令现在，一年还缺半年的粮食。因为全省的耕地面积只占总面积的百分之十五。每年必须有相当数量的粮食输入。按照一九三五至一九三六年的统计，仅潮汕一个地区，每年要从南洋、华东输入粮食二亿斤。而南洋输入的粮食须经香港转口，这就与港币发生了联系。第二，广东工业基础薄弱，工业品依靠外地输入。帝国主义的商品倾销、走私，使香港成为广东人民生活资料工业品的主要来源。而香港不准中国货币流通，人们不能不设法取得港币。这样，港币入侵的数量，就一年多过一年。
    和广东大陆解放同时，有二亿左右的港币随匪军溃退，约三亿元仍留境内，其中约有两亿充斥在广州市场。这样一个数量的港币，不独曾是英帝国主义劫夺广东人民巨额物资的工具，而且是在广州解放之初，匪特兴风作浪、奸商投机倒把的手段。港币的流通，乃是广州以及整个广东经济恢复的重大障碍。因此，这一问题一直是广州解放后一个中心工作。
    最初，当我们的银行和贸易机构还没有普遍建立起来的时候，广州市军管会于去年十一月十八日发出金字第一号通告，允许港币暂时流通，采取以排为主的方针，办法是提高侨汇牌价，压低港币牌价，借使港币外流。为了改变市民对港币的看法，市府就动员了两万多工人、学生，进行了广泛的宣传工作，也曾收到一些效果。但是，港币外流的速度极其缓慢。到今年二月三日，军管会颁布了金字第二号通告，禁止港币流通。这时对付港币的办法是以存兑为主，一方面继续教育市民，一方面提高港币牌价，使港币持有者乐于向银行存兑。此后，存兑的数字逐步增加，从每天几千元上升到几万、几十万甚至百余万元。不过存兑的数字和人民的储藏量比较，还是差的很远，港币依然不能肃清。这主要是由于人民币币值不稳，贸易公司掌握物资太少，加以走私严重，进口物资还有一定数量，港币还有它的市场。
    但是，从三月十六日物价下降起，情况起了根本的变化。到现在，人们已经看得出来，港币和物价开始脱节。我们有足够的物资供应市场需要，因此人民币不单可以买到东西，而且可以保值，它再也不跟港币的黑市乱跑，忽而与港币七千比一，忽而一万二比一，弄得物价跳动不已。因而不管香港或者伦敦有什么波动，对广州市场再也不会有什怎影响，港币黑市失去了它操纵广州物价的能力。举一个例子看：三月十五日的银行牌价，从港币一元比本币四千七百元挂高至一比五千二百元，二十日再改为一比五千九百元，二十三日更提高为一比六千一百五十元，在同一时间内，港币黑市不仅没有能够趁机推波助澜，刺激物价上涨，恰恰相反，其价格还一天天下降，至二十七日，港币黑市已跌至一比六千一百十七元，比牌价还低三十四元。四月末，牌价调整为一比五千九百元，黑市价格一直在五千九百元以下。按三月十五日至四月二十二日的指数计算，港币黑市价格已下降百分之八。事实上，从三月下旬以来，银行门前老是拥挤着用港币兑换人民币的人群，这是自古未有的现象。人民币信用的提高，已经是人人看得见的事实。四乡来穗办货的商人，见港币兑人民币并不吃亏，据广东省贸易厅报告，他们“交易信心大增”，正常的城乡物资交流的迹象，开始显露出来。人民币下乡，根绝港币的条件已初步具备。
