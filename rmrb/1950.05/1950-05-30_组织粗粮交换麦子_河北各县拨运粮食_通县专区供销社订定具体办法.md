Organize the Exchange of Coarse Grains for Wheat
	Hebei Province Allocates and Transports Grain
	Tong County Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative Formulates Specific Measures
[Baoding News] *Hebei Daily* news: In order to solve the grain shortage difficulties faced by Hebei Province, especially in disaster areas, during the lean season, the Central People's Government recently allocated another 130 million jin of coarse grains and 15 million jin of soybean cakes, instructing the provincial government to use coarse grains to exchange for fine grains and coarse grains to exchange for cotton. These grains and cakes are now being lent to the masses, and after the wheat harvest, the masses will repay with wheat or after the autumn harvest with cotton, or they can be exchanged for cotton now. This measure not only plays a significant role in solving the current grain shortage difficulties of the masses but also greatly benefits the adjustment of grain-to-wheat price ratios after the wheat harvest, resolving the difficulties faced by farmers in selling wheat, absorbing cotton, ensuring the supply of industrial raw materials, and supporting agricultural production. The Provincial Commercial Department, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and the Provincial Grain Company have, in accordance with the spirit of the central instructions, studied the procedures for allocating and exchanging grain, and organized transportation and storage methods. They have already distributed the figures for grain and soybean cakes to each special district. Each county has also begun to allocate and transport grain, organizing the grain exchange work.
[Our Newspaper, Tong County News] The Tong County Special District Supply and Marketing Cooperative has decided to use 18.5 million jin of coarse grains to pre-exchange for wheat from farmers in order to facilitate farmers' completion of summer hoeing and wheat harvesting, and has formulated preliminary pre-exchange measures. The planned allocation quantities are: Ji County 2.5 million jin, Sanhe 2 million jin, Xianghe 2.5 million jin, Tong County 1.5 million jin, Pinggu 500,000 jin, Liangxiang 500,000 jin, Daxing 1 million jin, Shunyi 1.5 million jin, Changping 400,000 jin, Fangshan 300,000 jin, Huairou 250,000 jin, Miyun 250,000 jin, Wanping 60,000 jin, Tong Town 500,000 jin; totaling 13.76 million jin, with the remaining 4.74 million jin reserved for flexible use.
The exchange principles are: timely distribution, assistance to production, integration with cooperative organizations, and guarantee of repayment. The primary target is poor farmers, followed by labor-producing rich peasants and landlords. The exchange ratio is 1.6 jin of sorghum, 1.1 jin of millet, and 1.5 jin of corn for 1 jin of autumn wheat from the masses, with cooperative members enjoying a 3% preferential treatment. If exchanging for spring wheat, a revised ratio must be determined after the planned figures are approved by the provincial cooperative. If the masses need materials and grain, the exchange will be based on the local market price ratio of the grain type exchanged and the materials exchanged as per the contract. After the grain is distributed to the county, district, and village, the distribution must be carried out in a democratic manner, with clear and simple procedures. More importantly, it must be carried out in conjunction with Party and government departments. During the grain exchange, attention should be paid to leveraging the organizational nature of the masses, motivating them to participate in cooperative societies and organize cooperative societies.

　　组织粗粮交换麦子
    河北各县拨运粮食
    通县专区供销社订定具体办法
    【保定讯】河北日报消息：中央人民政府为了解决河北省特别是灾区在青黄不接时缺粮的困难，最近又拨来粗粮一万万三千万斤，黄豆饼一千五百万斤，指示省府用粗粮换细粮、粗粮换棉花的办法，现在先借给群众，麦收后由群众折还小麦或大秋后折还棉花，或是现在用棉花折换。这一措施不光对解决目前群众缺粮困难作用很大，对麦收后调节粮麦比价，解决农民出卖小麦的困难，吸取棉花，保证工业原料的供给以及扶植农业生产上，都有很大好处。现在省人民政府商业厅、省供销总社、省粮食公司，已根据中央指示的精神，研究出拨粮、换粮的手续，组织运输和保管的办法。并已把粮食、豆饼数字分配到各专区。各县也已开始拨运粮食，组织进行换粮工作。
    【本报通县讯】通县专区供销社为便利农民完成夏锄和麦收，决定以粗粮一千八百五十万斤向农民预换麦子，并已订定初步预换办法。拟定分配的数量是：蓟县二五○万斤，三河二○○万斤，香河二五○万斤，通县一五○万斤，平谷五○万斤，良乡五○万斤，大兴一○○万斤，顺义一五○万斤，昌平四○万斤，房山三○万斤，怀柔二五万斤，密云二五万斤，宛平六万斤，通镇五○万斤；共一、三、七六万斤，其余四七四万斤留作机动使用。
    交换原则是：发放及时，帮助生产，结合组社，保证归还。对象以贫困农民为主，次及于劳动生产的富农和地主。交换比率以红粮一斤六两，谷子一斤十两，玉米一斤五两换群众秋麦一斤，社员得享受百分之三的优待。如交换春麦则须先计划数字经省社批准后重订比值。如群众需要物资及粮食则按合同所换粮种与所换物资的当地市场比价折合。粮食分配到县、区、村后，发放时必须做到方式民主，手续清楚简便。更重要的必须结合党、政部门进行。在换粮当中，应注意发挥群众的组织性，带动群众参加合作社、组织合作社。
