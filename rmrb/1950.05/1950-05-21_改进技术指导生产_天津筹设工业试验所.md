　　Improving Technology to Guide Production
    Tianjin Prepares to Establish Industrial Testing Institute
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 15th] The Preparatory Committee for the Tianjin Industrial Testing Institute held its first meeting on the 13th of this month. The Preparatory Committee consists of twelve members invited by the Tianjin Municipal Finance and Economics Committee from industrial circles, academic circles, and the Commodity Inspection Bureau. The purpose of establishing the Industrial Testing Institute is to organize existing technical equipment and personnel to improve industrial production technology, reward and guide production. At present, there are many areas in Tianjin's industrial production technology that do not meet standards and need to be improved and guided. Many factories have requested guidance and assistance from the government. At the same time, Tianjin's existing industrial technical equipment is incomplete and scattered, and the government needs to organize it in order to make full use, expand and improve it. The Tianjin Industrial Testing Institute is being established under the suggestion of the Tianjin Municipal People's Consultative Committee and the Federation of Industry and Commerce. The Preparatory Committee has decided to start by understanding the technical equipment in Tianjin and dividing it into two aspects, chemical testing and research, entrusting the Tianjin Engineering Society to draw up a preliminary work plan for the Industrial Testing Institute.

　　改进技术指导生产
    天津筹设工业试验所
    【新华社天津十五日电】天津市工业试验所筹备委员会已于本月十三日召开首次会议。筹委会系由天津市财经委员会邀请工业界、学术界、商品检验局各方面人士共十二人组成。工业试验所成立的目的，在于组织现有的技术设备和人员，以改进工业生产技术，奖励和指导生产。目前天津市工业生产技术不合标准需要改进指导的地方很多，许多工厂曾请求政府给予指导和帮助；同时，天津市现有的工业技术设备则是不完全和分散的，需要政府加以组织，以便充分利用、扩大和改善。天津市工业试验所即是在天津市各界协商委员会和工商联合会建议下筹组的。这次筹备委员会决定先着手了解天津市的技术设备，并分为化验和研究两方面，委托天津市工程师学会订出工业试验所的初步工作计划。
