　　Warning to Atomic Warmongers
    ——Academician Lysenko, President of the Soviet Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Answers Questions from "New Times" Editor

    You asked me what I think of the results and resolutions of the Stockholm meeting of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. It is not enough to say that I wholeheartedly agree with and support it. Any fair scientist who dedicates himself to science and serves the people cannot and has no right to stand aside from the peace movement that demands an absolute ban on the use of atomic weapons for aggression and mass destruction of humanity, from a moral point of view. I was deeply moved by Joliot-Curie's speech. The Standing Committee, based on his call, appealed to all good people to sign this appeal. It is precisely because there is supreme and immortal truth in his speech. Let me reach across borders and shake hands with this French scholar and fighter.

    Progressive science and aggressive atomic warfare are as antagonistic and irreconcilable as life and death. A progressive and fair scientist must never be an accomplice and helper of warmongers who use scientific achievements for selfish and criminal purposes. He must be a fighter for peace.

    Medieval barbarians subjected progressive scholars to the fire. Today's barbarians, with the help of some scholars, want to burn all culture with atomic fire. Unfortunately, in the countries of the dollar, some reactionary scientists have betrayed themselves and science—sold themselves to atomic cannibals. These traitors who betray the people and use science to seek advantages, they insult science, they sell the sacred right of the people to work and develop freely in peace to capitalists in exchange for some pitiful alms.

    What have these scientists done for mankind? What have they prepared for farmers, students, mothers, and babies? The word death! I think these degree-holding rogues should be treated the same as war criminals; and their place should be in the defendant's seat.

    The mission of science is to serve peace, increase the happiness of the people, improve their lives, and protect their freedom. But imperialists turn it into a slave of war, as a tool to oppress the people, plunder wealth, and as a weapon of aggression. They are using science to prepare for war against the Soviet Union, against the people's democratic countries, and against all democratic forces.

    Just scientists and intellectuals in every country have a sacred obligation to explain to the people that the socialist Soviet Union is not and cannot be an aggressive country. From the day the Soviet Federal Republic was born, it declared its willingness to live in peace and friendship with all countries.

    We are designing and building tractor factories, spinning mills, cultural palaces, residences, schools, hospitals, theaters, and universities. Look, a great palace of science is being built on Lenin Peak in Moscow: the new Moscow University. Soon, studios and laboratories will open its doors to thousands of young men and women. And there is no doubt that among these young men and women there will be children of those who are currently participating in the construction work.

    If Soviet science is advanced science, it is precisely because it is creative, promotes human progress, and the happiness of the people.

    Soviet scholars are dedicated to construction and are striving to achieve greater material wealth for our people in the short term. We do not wait for the gifts of nature, but take them from it. The struggle against the forces of nature is difficult. It often takes years of struggle to overcome them. But in the Soviet Union, there are no insurmountable difficulties.

    In the autumn of 1948, the Soviet people launched a general attack on drought. The magnificent Stalin plan to change nature was implemented, with a series of protective forest belts being established to enable vast cultivated land to avoid drought. Within ten years, the face of our land will be completely changed. The harvest in collective farms and state farms will be further increased. From this, the Soviet people will not be controlled by the blind forces of nature.

    The Soviet people and its scholars are engaged in completing many huge tasks and solving some important problems in all aspects of economic and cultural construction. There are still many great plans and programs that require our labor and knowledge.

    The powerful socialist country—the Soviet Union—is a lover of peace. But history has also proved that whoever attacks the Soviet Union will suffer a disastrous defeat.

    In the war against German and Japanese fascist imperialists and their vassals, it has been proven to the whole world that the Soviet social and political system is the most powerful in the world. Under the guidance of the Lenin-Stalin Communist Party led by Stalin, the economic strength of the Soviet Union, the will of the Soviet people, and the unity of political views saved the world that was to be enslaved by the fascists.

    The people's movement to defend peace against the instigators of a new world war has become an increasingly powerful and most effective factor in our century. The number of peace fighters is in the hundreds of millions. These fighters are the people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, the people's democratic countries of Europe, and millions of workers and just intellectuals in other capitalist countries. The strength of the peace-defending ranks is much stronger than the strength of the imperialists and warmongers, and there are many facts to prove this.

    The American imperialists supplied Chiang Kai-shek's partners with large amounts of money and murder weapons, wanting to turn the great Chinese people into their slaves economically and politically. But the heroic Chinese people, united under the banner of the Communist Party, proved that they were stronger than the American imperialists. The Chinese people seized the weapons supplied by the US imperialists from the Kuomintang bandits and used them to counterattack their oppressors. The Chinese people were liberated, and they set an example for the people of other colonies and vassal states.

    The Soviet people not only warmly support the call of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress to absolutely ban atomic weapons, but also repeat this solemn oath:

    "We believe that any government that first uses atomic weapons against any other country is committing a crime against humanity and should be regarded as a war criminal."

    There is no doubt that the good people in every country will respond to the call issued by the Standing Committee and continue to strengthen the struggle to ban atomic weapons. The signatures of millions of peace defenders under this call will be a terrible new warning to the Anglo-American atomicists. Their feverish heads need to be cleared. They will know that their sins cannot escape judgment, and they absolutely cannot escape the severe punishment of the angry people.

    Soviet scientists fully agree with the resolutions of the Stockholm Conference, and they will stand at the forefront of the struggle for lasting peace in the world as they have in the past. (Translated by Yun Feng from the Soviet "New Times" magazine, March 29, 1950)

　　警告原子黩武主义者
    ——苏联列宁农业科学院院长李森科答《新时代》编者问
    你们问我对于世界拥护和平大会常设委员会在斯德哥尔摩会议的结果和决议有何感想。只说我衷心赞同和拥护还是不够的。凡是一个献身为科学和为人民服务的公正科学家，对于要求绝对禁止原子武器用于侵略和大量毁灭人类的保卫和平运动，从道义上，就不能而且也无权置身事外。约里奥·居里的演说使我深为感动，常设委员会以他的号召为基础，呼吁一切善良的人民在这呼吁书上签名。正因为在他的演说中存在着至高无上的和不朽的真理。让我越过国境，伸手和这位法国的学者与斗士紧握。
    进步的科学和侵略性的原子战争，有如生与死一样的敌对和绝不相容。一个进步的和公正的科学家，决不能做为了自私自利和罪犯的目的而利用科学成果的战争煽动者的同谋和帮凶。他必定是一个保卫和平的斗士。
    中世纪的野蛮人曾把进步的学者施以火刑。今日的野蛮人赖有一些学者的帮助，却要以原子的火刑焚毁所有的文化。很不幸的，在美元的国家里有些反动的科学家已经出卖了他自己和科学，——卖给了原子的食人者。这些背弃人民和利用科学取巧的叛徒，他们侮辱了科学，他们把人民在和平中工作和自由发展的神圣权利出卖给资本家，以换取一些可怜的施舍。
    这些科学家替人类做了些什么呢？他们对于农民，学生，母亲和婴孩又预备了些什么呢？就是死亡两个字！我认为这些得了学位的无赖汉应当与战犯一样的看待；并且他们的位子应当被放在被告人的席位。
    科学的使命在于为和平服务，增加人民的幸福，改进人民的生活和保护他的自由。但是帝国主义者把它变成战争的奴役，作为压迫人民的工具，掠夺财富和侵略的武器。他们正利用科学准备反对苏联，反对人民民主国家和一切民主力量的战争。
    每一国家中的公正的科学家和知识分子，都有神圣的义务去向人民解释，社会主义的苏联不是也不可能是一个侵略的国家。自苏维埃联邦共和国降生的那一天，即宣布了愿与一切国家在和平与友好中相处。
    我们正在设计建造拖拉机工厂，纺纱厂，文化宫，住宅，学校，医院，戏院和大学。看吧，在莫斯科的列宁峰上正在建筑一座伟大的科学宫：新莫斯科大学。不久，工作室和实验室即可把它的大门为万千的青年男女开启了。并且毫无疑问的，在这些青年男女中定有目前正在那里参加建筑工作者的子女。
    假如说苏联的科学是前进的科学，那就正因为它是创造性的，促进人类进步和人民幸福的。
    苏联的学者献身于建设事业，正在为我们的人民在短期内争取他们物质方面更大的富裕。我们不等待自然的恩赐，而是向它夺取。与自然界力量的斗争是很困难的。为了战胜它们常常需要长年的奋斗。但是在苏联这个国家里，是没有不可克服的困难的。
    一九四八年秋天，苏联人民发动了一个对旱灾的总攻击。开始执行斯大林改变自然的壮伟的计划，以一系列的防护森林地带的建立，使广大的耕田得能避免旱灾。十年内我们土地的面貌将完全改变。在集体农场和国家农场的收获量将更行增高。由此苏联的人民将会不为自然的盲目力量所控制。
    苏联的人民和他的学者们在经济和文化建设的各方面，正从事完成许多巨大的工作和解决一些重要的问题。还有许多伟大的计划和方案需要着我们的劳力和知识。
    强有力的社会主义国家——苏联，是酷爱和平的。但历史也证明谁要进攻苏联谁就要遭遇惨败。
    在反对德国和日本法西斯帝国主义者和他们的附庸的战争中，已给全世界证明，苏联的社会和政治制度在世界上是最强有力的。在斯大林为首的列宁、斯大林共产党指导下，苏联经济的强盛，苏联人民的意志和政见的统一，曾挽救了法西斯主义者所要奴役的世界。
    反对新世界战争煽动者的人民保卫和平运动，在我们的世纪中，已成为一个日见强大和最有效的因素。保卫和平战士的数目当以万万计。这些战士就是苏联的，中华人民共和国的，欧洲人民民主国家的人民和其他资本主义国家中数百万的劳动者和公正的知识阶级中的人士。保卫和平行列的力量是比帝国主义者和战争煽动者的力量强大得多了，这是有很多事实证明的。
    美帝国主义者曾供给蒋介石伙伴以大量的金钱和杀人武器，想把伟大的中国人民在经济上和政治上变成他们的奴隶。但是英勇的中国人民团结在共产党旗帜之下，证明了他们比美帝国主义者的力量更大。中国人民从国民党匪帮手中将美帝供给的武器夺过来，用以反击他们的压迫者。中国的人民解放了，他们为其他殖民地人民和附庸国人民指出了榜样。
    苏联人民对于世界拥护和平大会常设委员会号召绝对禁止原子武器的呼吁，不但热烈拥护，而且要重复这庄严的誓言：
    “我们认为任何首先使用原子武器对付任何其他国家的政府，即是犯了反对人类的罪过，就应该当作战犯看待。”
    毫无疑问，每一国家中善良的人民将响应由常设委员会所发出的号召，并继续加强禁止原子武器的斗争。在这个号召下千百万保卫和平者的签名，对于英美的原子主义者将是一个可怕的新警告。他们热昏的头脑需要清醒。他们将会知道：他们的罪恶是逃不掉裁判的，他们绝对逃不掉愤怒的人民对他们的严厉处罚。
    苏联的科学家们完全赞同斯德哥尔摩会议的决议，他们将像过去一样站在为全世界持久和平斗争的最前线。（云风译自一九五○年三月二十九日苏联新时代杂志）
