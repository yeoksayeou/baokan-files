　　Nanjing Federation of Literary and Art Circles Holds Symposium
　  Hearing Liu Yuan's Self-Criticism
　　Liu Yuan Admits His Past Crime of Creating Cartoons Against the People, Resolves to Reform.
    [Nanjing News] According to the Nanjing Xinhua Daily report on the 11th: The Nanjing Federation of Literary and Art Circles convened a symposium on April 23, gathering artists and cultural workers from the city to listen to the self-criticism of reactionary cartoonist Liu Yuan and help him further recognize his past crimes and reform himself. Liu Yuan had published many reactionary cartoons in the Kuomintang's extremely reactionary "Soldier's Weekly" and "Central Daily News" of the puppet Ministry of National Defense, viciously slandering the people and promoting anti-communism and anti-Sovietism. After the liberation of Nanjing, Liu Yuan continued to paint in Nanjing. Although he had stopped making reactionary propaganda in his paintings, he did not have a significant understanding of his past crimes against the people, nor did he confess his crimes frankly to the people. When the Nanjing Federation of Literary and Art Circles was established last December, his application for membership was not approved. Only then did Liu Yuan begin to realize the seriousness of his crimes against the people. He wrote several letters to Lai Shaoqi, director of the Literature and Art Department, making preliminary self-criticisms and earnestly requesting the Federation of Literary and Art Circles to give him more effective education and help. The Federation accepted his request and convened a meeting of artists and cultural workers in the city on April 23 to listen to Liu Yuan's self-criticism. Some of Liu Yuan's reactionary works were also exhibited during the meeting. In his self-criticism, Liu Yuan stated that he had accepted the position of "special editor" of the "Soldier's Weekly" of the bandit Ministry of National Defense's Information Bureau, and made cartoons based on an extremely slanderous and rumor-mongering booklet and reactionary newspapers of the bandit gang, deceiving the people and slandering thousands of revolutionary patriots. He said: "Now, I deeply hate my ignorance and ignorance, and I hate even more the feudal forces that poisoned me and the Kuomintang reactionaries headed by Chiang Kai-shek." And expressed his determination to confess his crimes to the people and start anew. After Liu Yuan made his self-criticism, Fang Guangtao, Tie Ma, Shao Hengqiu, Lai Shaoqi and other artists and cultural workers in Nanjing put forward their opinions to Liu Yuan seriously and sincerely. Everyone pointed out that his self-criticism showed that he recognized his past crimes and was determined to reform himself, which was good. At the same time, they pointed out that it was wrong for him to attribute the cause of his mistakes to "supra-partisanship" and "petty-bourgeois ideology," and that he should recognize the fact that he had harmed the people by standing on the side of the reactionary rulers and make further self-criticism. Lai Shaoqi also pointed out that in several battles, captured Kuomintang officers and soldiers carried reactionary "Soldier's Weekly" on their bodies, which showed that Liu Yuan's cartoons played a certain role in harming the people. He asked him to deeply reflect on his crimes, work hard to reform, and ask the people to atone for his crimes by good deeds.
    After the meeting, the Nanjing Federation of Literary and Art Circles received many written impressions from the art and cultural circles. Everyone agreed that this meeting was a very good education and praised the government's lenient policy of educating and reforming Liu Yuan. Everyone welcomed Liu Yuan's preliminary self-criticism, but pointed out that his self-criticism was still far from enough. For example, Professor Wen Jinyang of the Art Department of Nanjing University wrote: "I saw the comrades in the literary and art circles at the self-criticism meeting sincerely helping Liu Yuan, the enemy of the past, to understand his past mistakes and move towards the bright road... I think this self-criticism meeting was of great help to Liu Yuan. At the same time, it has further educated our colleagues in the literary and art circles, enabling us to take a big step forward in our political understanding and creative methods."

　　南京文联召开座谈会
　  听取刘元自我检讨
　　刘元承认过去制作漫画与人民为敌的罪恶，决心改过自新。
    【南京讯】据南京新华日报十一日消息：南京市文联于四月二十三日召集该市美术及文化工作者举行座谈会，听取反动漫画作者刘元的自我检讨，并帮助其进一步认识过去的罪恶，改过自新。按刘元曾在国民党极反动的伪国防部“士兵周刊”与“中央日报”上发表许多反动漫画，十分恶毒地污蔑人民，宣传反共反苏。南京解放后，刘元继续留在南京作画，虽然已从画面上停止作反动宣传，但对自己过去反人民的罪恶并没有显著的认识，亦未向人民坦白认罪。去年十二月南京市文联成立时，未批准其入会的申请。至此刘元才开始发觉其反人民罪恶的严重性，曾数次致函文艺处处长赖少其作初步检讨，并恳切要求文联给他更有效的教育和帮助。文联接受了他的请求，于四月二十三日集合该市美术及文化工作者开会，听取刘元的自我检讨。会间并展览了一部分刘元的反动作品。检讨中，刘元声述他过去接受了匪国防部新闻局“士兵周刊”“特约编辑”的职务，根据匪帮一本极尽污蔑造谣的小册子和反动报章制作漫画，欺蒙人民，诬蔑了千万的革命志士。他说：“现在，我深深地痛恨自己的糊涂无知，更痛恨毒害我的封建势力以及蒋匪为首的国民党反动派。”并表示决心向人民认罪，重新做人。当刘元作了自我检讨之后，南京市美术、文化工作者方光焘、铁马、邵恒秋、赖少其等都严肃而诚恳地向刘元提出了意见。大家指出他的检讨中认识了过去的罪恶，决意改过自新，这种要求是好的。同时又指出他的发言中，把错误原因推到“超党派”和“小资产阶级思想”是不对的，要他认清过去站在反动统治者方面危害人民的事实，作进一步的检讨。赖少其并指出在好几次战役中，被俘的国民党官兵身上都带着反动的“士兵周刊”，足见刘元的漫画起了一定的危害人民的作用。要求他深刻反省自己的罪恶，努力改造，向人民请求将功赎罪。
    会后，南京市文联收到了美术界和文化界的许多书面感想，大家一致认为这一会议是一个很好的教育，并赞扬人民政府对于刘元教育改造的宽大政策。大家对刘元的初步检讨表示欢迎，但都指出其检讨还十分不够。如南京大学艺术系文金扬教授写道：“我看到检讨会上文艺界的同志对于过去的敌人——刘元那样出于至诚地帮助他了解自己过去的错误，而走向光明大道，…我觉得这次检讨会对刘元的帮助太大了。同时更教育了我们文艺界同人。使我们在政治认识上，创作方法上前进了一大步。”
