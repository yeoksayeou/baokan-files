Chairman Wu Yunfu, fellow representatives, honored guests:

　　The "National Relief Representative Conference" has opened, and I first congratulate the successful convening of the conference and wish the conference success.

　　Today, on the territory of China, except for individual regions such as Tibet, Taiwan, and Hainan Island (which is being liberated), the vast majority of the people have been liberated; the people's democratic dictatorship regime from the central to the local levels has been established; the Chinese people have begun to move from the war period to the construction period; this is something to rejoice in for the Chinese people and their friends.

　　However, in the many years of national and democratic revolutionary wars, the disasters directly and indirectly caused to the Chinese people by the Japanese invaders, puppet troops, and the Chiang bandits armed by American imperialism were extremely cruel and serious. Everyone knows that during the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese invaders used all their strength to try to eliminate the anti-Japanese troops and civilians in the liberated areas behind enemy lines. In the continuous "sweeps" and "suppressions," they adopted the "Three Alls Policy" of killing all, burning all, and looting all, and created many no-man's lands that stretched for hundreds of miles. The lives, property, and production and construction undertakings of the people in the liberated areas suffered heavy losses and damage. We will never forget the crimes of the Japanese fascist bandits.

　　Simultaneous with the Japanese invaders' frenzied offensive, the Kuomintang reactionaries adopted a policy of passively resisting Japan and actively opposing communism, sending more than a million bandit troops to blockade the liberated areas, and cooperating with the Japanese invaders and puppet troops to openly carry out inhumane massacres and destruction of the liberated areas.

　　In the People's Liberation War, the Kuomintang reactionaries, with the full support of American imperialism, did everything they could against the people. Wherever the bandit troops went, they burned, killed, looted, bombed factories, and destroyed dikes, doing everything they could. Recently, they have even bombed residents along the coast. Their ferocious and evil deeds surpass those of the fascist Japanese invaders.

　　Due to the long-term rule of feudalism, bureaucracy, and imperialism, and the various destructions mentioned above, the people have been deprived of their ability to prevent natural disasters. Although the people have gone through untold hardships to win revolutionary victory, war wounds are ultimately unavoidable. Although the Chinese people have achieved great victories and rich experience in the continuous struggle against famine, the disasters left behind still hinder our smooth progress in construction work. In particular, the famine caused directly by the destruction of the Chiang-American bandit gangs in various places last year has not been completely overcome, and we must work together to continue to eliminate these disasters.

　　More than 150 people are attending this conference, including representatives from relevant departments of the Central People's Government, representatives from the People's Liberation Army, representatives from relevant national mass organizations, representatives from relevant relief and welfare organizations, representatives from the people being relieved, representatives from various regions, representatives from overseas Chinese, representatives from the China Welfare Fund, representatives from the China Liberated Areas Relief General Association, and specially invited well-known people in the relief field. This is an unprecedented conference uniting national relief and welfare workers. I think that with this strong united front of our national relief and welfare workers, and with the leadership of the national relief agency to be established soon, we will have more confidence in continuing to eliminate the disasters of the Chinese people.

　　Here, I will give a brief report on the establishment and work of the China Liberated Areas Relief General Association, and at the same time put forward opinions on future relief work for your discussion and correction.

　　At the preparatory meeting of the China Liberated Areas People's Representative Conference held in Yan'an on July 13, 1945, many representatives foresaw the arduousness of the task of post-war recovery and construction, and in order to unify the strength of all parties to assist the liberated area governments in completing relief and rehabilitation work during and after the war, they suggested the establishment of a joint relief organization for the entire liberated area. This suggestion was unanimously approved by all 139 preparatory committee members, and a resolution was passed to establish the China Liberated Areas Provisional Relief Committee. The establishment of the Provisional Relief Committee was announced, and it immediately began to promote the establishment of relief branch associations in various liberated areas in preparation for the establishment of the China Liberated Areas Relief General Association. As of January 1946, branch associations had been established in Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Jin-Sui, Jin-Cha-Ji, Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, Ji-Re-Liao, Shandong, Su-Wan, and E-Yu-Wan. In mid-April 1946, a representative meeting of various branch associations was convened in Beiping to discuss the relief and rehabilitation work at that time, and the China Liberated Areas Relief General Association was officially announced. In the four years and nine months since the establishment of relief organizations, it can be roughly divided into three periods according to the location of work.

　　Yan'an Period – July 1945 to July 1946.

　　The Relief Committee established extensive contacts and close cooperation with the governments of various liberated areas, branch associations, peace hospitals, childcare institutions, and other welfare organizations, and investigated and reported on all people's losses caused by enemy burning, killing, looting, bombing, destruction, and various natural disasters behind enemy lines, as well as the needs for medical and health care, childcare, and refugee relief. In addition, it collected materials and photos of the enemy's crimes and publicized and accused them at home and abroad. During this period, it published English Relief Gazette and Chinese Relief Newsletter, which were distributed to friendly international relief organizations, relief branch associations, and relevant people. The central content was to report on the construction of relief and welfare work in the liberated areas and exchange work experience.

　　The Relief Committee established formal contact with the China Defense League, led by Vice Chairman Soong Ching Ling at that time, which is now the China Welfare Fund. Throughout the Anti-Japanese War, under the leadership of Vice Chairman Soong, the China Defense League provided strong support to the troops and civilians in the liberated areas who persisted in resisting Japan behind enemy lines. The China Defense League provided all possible assistance in terms of manpower and materials for the construction of various international peace hospitals and childcare institutions in the liberated areas. Many international friends who loved progress and peace also established anti-Japanese contacts with the people of the liberated areas through Vice Chairman Soong, and Dr. Bethune and Dr. Kotnis dedicated their lives to the anti-Japanese cause. Their great spirit of internationalism inspired the anti-Japanese will of our troops and civilians. All of this is inseparable from the work of the China Defense League under the leadership of Vice Chairman Soong and its successor, the China Welfare Fund.

　　During this period, donations from the outside world (mainly groups and individuals contacted by the China Defense League) were received and distributed by the Relief Committee, and receipts were obtained by the Relief Committee and sent to the donors by the handlers. The receipt and expenditure procedures and accounts have always been clear. "Relief organizations do not use relief materials" This is our discipline and slogan. During this period, donations received were worth approximately 761.39 million yuan in Chiang coins at that time, and important medical supplies were approximately 30 tons.

　　Shanghai Period – July 1946 to December 1947.

　　In July 1946, just as the US-Chiang cooperation was superficially using the Beiping Executive Headquarters to talk about a ceasefire as a cover, and in fact launching a large-scale offensive against our People's Liberation Army, UNRRA, through Marshall, proposed to General Zhou Enlai to invite our side to send representatives to participate in the distribution of UNRRA's materials to China. This had its purpose and effect. In order to provide relief to the people who bravely persisted in the anti-Japanese war behind enemy lines for the huge losses they suffered, and to facilitate negotiations and struggles with the UNRRA, the Relief General Association established an office in Shanghai, and appointed Wu Yunfu, the Secretary-General of the Relief General Association, concurrently as the director of the office, and Lin Zhong as the director of operations. In the following year and a half, the focus of the Relief General Association's work was in Shanghai. Its main tasks were to submit reports and materials on the losses of the anti-Japanese war in the liberated areas to the UNRRA and to negotiate for relief and rehabilitation materials that the liberated areas should receive; on the other hand, it also established direct contact with the branch associations and port offices in the liberated areas to carry out the receipt, storage, transportation and distribution of UNRRA relief materials.

　　According to statistics at the time, the population in need of relief nationwide was 42 million, of which the population in need of relief in the liberated areas was 26 million. According to this proportion, the liberated areas should have received three-fifths of all UNRRA's materials to China. However, due to the policy of American imperialism to use the name of UNRRA relief and in fact use UNRRA materials to fully support Chiang Kai-shek in fighting the civil war; therefore, the people in the liberated areas who sacrificed the most and suffered the most in the eight-year anti-Japanese war only received more than 50,000 tons of UNRRA relief materials, which only accounted for 2% of the total of more than 2.36 million tons of UNRRA's materials to China.

　　The Shanghai Office of the Relief General Association has continuously carried out righteous exposure and protests against this violation of UNRRA's non-discrimination policy, the fact that the US-Chiang cooperation used relief materials for military purposes, the conspiracy of Chiang and the US to use the Yellow River breach to achieve the military purpose of opposing communism and the people, the crimes of Chiang bandits' military obstruction of relief materials to the liberated areas, and the corruption and embezzlement of relief materials by the UNRRA, and has repeatedly caused collective signature campaigns by UNRRA staff to protest against the illegal acts of the UNRRA authorities, which made the people of the world begin to realize what the purpose of the so-called "relief" to China under the control of the US imperialism was!

　　During the Shanghai period, the Relief General Association also directly contacted the China Welfare Fund and other international relief organizations to be responsible for handling liaison matters related to relief and welfare work in the liberated areas.

　　Shijiazhuang and Beijing Period – December 1947 to April 1950.

　　In December 1947, UNRRA ended its work in China, and the staff of the Relief General Association withdrew from Shanghai to the liberated areas and merged with the headquarters of the Relief General Association, which had moved from Yan'an to Shijiazhuang. Xiong Jinzheng was appointed as the Deputy Secretary-General and was responsible for actual work, which began the third period of UNRRA work. During this period, the US-Chiang offensive against us had been stopped nationwide. On the contrary, we were moving from defense to complete victory. The war was extremely fierce, traffic was blocked, and there was very little external liaison work. Initially, representatives from the World Student Relief Association came to visit the liberated areas, and medical staff from the United Nations World Health Organization and the New Zealand Overseas Service Team successively came to serve in peace hospitals. Subsequently, the Friends Service Unit transported medical supplies and sent black fever medical teams to work in the Ji-Lu-Yu area. In August 1948, the North China Working Team of the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund came to Shijiazhuang and negotiated with the Relief General Association and exchanged letters of understanding, stipulating that the Fund would allocate 500,000 US dollars (later increased to 750,000 US dollars) to assist the liberated areas in carrying out maternal and child health work.

　　This cooperation later proved to be extremely unsuccessful. This was mainly because although the Children's Emergency Fund was a United Nations organization, it was still controlled by American imperialism. The Fund violated the agreement, and the materials came in small quantities and slowly, and the quality was poor. In one year, only 105,000 US dollars of materials were transported, less than one-seventh of the total agreed amount. Among the 824 boxes of medical supplies transported, 304 boxes were hand towels. The association demanded the establishment of its own independent and huge institution, and especially insisted on the control of materials and warehouses. It repeatedly threatened to stop the transportation of materials and withdraw its work. Finally, on December 31, 1949, the Relief General Association was forced to issue a solemn statement announcing that the Shijiazhuang Understanding had become invalid. After the statement was published, they felt that their fox tail had been exposed, so they had to quickly transport 300,000 US dollars of materials again. We should solemnly warn international relief organizations or individuals of this kind that are used by imperialism that all their conspiracies are doomed to failure.

　　In February 1949, Beijing was liberated, and in September, the Relief General Association moved to Beijing. From October, it began to prepare for the National Relief Representative Conference until today. This is an overview of the past work of the Relief General Association.

　　With the development of the new situation of the basic victory of the revolution throughout the country, new tasks and requirements have been put forward for the Relief General Association and the entire people's relief cause. First of all, the People's Republic of China has long been established, and the name of the China Liberated Areas Relief General Association is outdated. Its nature, purpose and tasks need to be re-examined and changed. As for the entire people's relief cause, it has been valued by the people's own government in the past and now, and the current disaster relief work is a clear proof, and it will still be the case in the future. However, under the favorable conditions of national unification in the future, our mass organizations, relevant departments and public and private welfare relief organizations have the conditions and responsibilities to unite and assist the government in doing a good job in the people's relief and welfare cause. Based on the past disaster relief policies in the liberated areas and the experience of the Relief General Association itself, and in line with the requirements of today's new situation, I should provide the following points to the representatives for future relief work:

　　(1) In order to assist the government in promoting the national relief and welfare cause in a planned way, and in order to strengthen the mutual connection between the national relief and welfare organizations and the relevant government departments, a new national relief organization with a united front under the principles of new democracy and its new constitution that is jointly observed should be established at this conference. It should become a bridge between the government and the people's relief and welfare organizations, abide by the government's policies, laws and decrees, and the resolutions of the conference, unite the national relief and welfare organizations, pool the wisdom of the masses, and implement reasonable division of labor and cooperation throughout the country to maximize the efficiency of relief and welfare work.

　　(2) According to the current specific situation, the wounds of the Chinese people ravaged by the US and Chiang are in urgent need of recovery, and famine is seriously present. Therefore, in the recent period, we should definitely focus on relief work, vigorously assist the government in carrying out disaster relief, relieve unemployed workers, widely mobilize social mutual assistance, launch a thrift and disaster relief movement, use various methods to hold fund-raising activities, and organize medical teams to go to the countryside to serve the disaster-stricken people.

　　(3) Relief work must be combined with production and construction, and relief work must be based on the national mass production movement. The experience of disaster relief work in the past liberated areas has proved that this is the only correct policy for relief work.

　　(4) The relief work of the new China should mainly rely on mobilizing and organizing the broad masses to carry out production for self-help and thrift and mutual assistance. Relief funds and materials should mainly be raised domestically, and the government should subsidize the shortfall. We should not rely on foreign aid. Past experience has fully proved that the purpose of the so-called "relief" work carried out in China by imperialist countries such as Britain and the United States and their followers is to serve the interests of imperialism, and they will never carry out any relief work for the Chinese people. The recent malicious propaganda by the American imperialists in the newspapers about the expansion of our country's famine makes it easy to see their true intentions. In addition, the conspiracy of the US imperialists to use public and private relief organizations to engage in conspiracies against the new China is also worthy of our attention and serious vigilance.

　　On the other hand, internationally, we do not refuse to accept friendly assistance from all international organizations and people, but all foreign relief funds and materials should be uniformly approved, distributed and used by the new national relief agency to be established by this conference through the government's legal procedures. This is a measure that a people's democratic dictatorship country must take.

　　中国解放区救济总会工作报告提纲
    一九五○年四月二十五日在中国人民救济代表会议上
    伍云甫主席、诸位代表、诸位来宾：
    “全国救济代表会议”开幕了，我首先庆贺会议的顺利召开，并预祝会议的成功。
    今天在中国的领土上，除了西藏、台湾、海南岛（正在解放之中）等个别地区外，广大的人民全都解放了；由中央到地方的人民民主专政政权，都已建立起来；中国人民已开始由战争时期走向建设时期；这是中国人民及其友人所欢欣鼓舞的。
    可是在多年来的民族、民主革命战争中，日寇、伪军、以及被美帝国主义武装的蒋匪，直接、间接给中国人民造下的灾难，是异常惨酷的严重的。大家都知道，抗日战争期间，日寇用尽一切力量，企图消灭敌后抗战的解放区军民。在不断地“扫荡”和“清剿”中，采取了杀光、烧光、抢光的“三光政策”，并制造了多少个绵延数百里的无人区。解放区人民的生命、财产和生产建设事业，受到惨重的损失和破坏。日本法西斯匪帮的罪行，我们是永不会忘记的。
    和日寇的疯狂进攻同时，国民党反动派采取消极抗日、积极反共的政策，派遣百万以上的匪军，对解放区进行封锁，并配合日寇、伪军，对解放区公然进行惨无人道的屠杀与破坏。
    在人民解放战争中，国民党反动派受到美帝国主义的全力支持，更极尽其反人民的能事。匪军所至，烧杀抢掠，炸毁工厂，破坏堤防，无所不为。最近更在沿海一带轰炸居民。其穷凶极恶的程度，较之法西斯日寇，有过之而无不及。
    由于封建、官僚和帝国主义的长期统治和上述种种的摧毁破坏，已经剥夺了人民预防天灾的能力。至今日人民虽历尽千辛万苦，赢得了革命胜利，但战争创伤，终属不可避免。中国人民不断地和灾荒作斗争当中，虽然已取得了伟大的胜利和丰富的经验，但是遗留下来的灾难，还阻碍着我们顺利进行建设工作。特别是去年各地因蒋美匪帮破坏，直接造成的灾荒现象，尚未完全渡过，我们是必须群策群力为继续消除这些灾难而奋斗的。
    这次出席会议的，有中央人民政府有关部会的机关代表，人民解放军代表，全国各有关群众团体代表，各有关救济福利团体代表，被救济人民代表，各地区代表，华侨代表，中国福利基金会的代表，中国解放区救济总会的代表和特邀的救济界知名人士等一百五十多人。这是一个空前的全国救济、福利工作者团结的会议。我想有了我们全国救济福利工作者这种坚强的统一战线，有了即将成立的全国救济机关的领导，我们对于继续消除中国人民的灾难，是会更有信心的。
    这里我把中国解放区救济总会建立的经过及其工作情形，作一概要报告，同时提出今后对救济工作的意见，请各位讨论和指正。
    一九四五年七月十三日在延安召开的中国解放区人民代表会议筹备会上，许多代表预见到战后恢复与建设工作责任之艰巨，并为统一各方面力量协助解放区政府完成战时和战后的救济与善后工作起见，建议成立一个全解放区的联合救济机构，此建议获得全体一百三十九名筹备委员之一致赞同，并通过决议成立中国解放区临时救济委员会。临救会宣告成立，立即着手推动各解放区救济分会的建立，准备成立中国解放区救济总会。至一九四六年一月为止，在陕甘宁、晋绥、晋察冀、晋冀鲁豫、冀热辽、山东、苏皖和鄂豫皖等八个地区先后成立了分会。一九四六年四月中旬在北平召集了各分会的代表会议讨论了当时的救济与善后工作，中国解放区救济总会乃正式宣布成立。自开始成立救济机构以来的四年又九个月中，按工作地点之不同，大致可分为三个时期。
    延安时期——一九四五年七月至一九四六年七月。
    救委会与各解放区政府、分会、和平医院、保育机关及其他福利机构建立广泛联系，密切配合，对敌寇在敌后进行烧杀、劫掠、轰炸、破坏和各种天灾所造成的一切人民损失，以及对医药卫生、儿童保育、难民救济等需求情形做了调查报道。此外还搜集了敌寇罪行的资料和照片，向国内外作了宣传与控诉。在这个时期中，曾出版英文救济公报及中文的救济通讯，分送各友好的国际救济团体各救济分会及有关人士。其中心内容为报道解放区救济及福利工作之建设情况，并交流工作经验。
    救委会与宋庆龄副主席那时所领导的中国保卫大同盟，即现在的中国福利基金会，建立了正式联系。整个抗战期间，中国保卫大同盟在宋副主席领导下，对坚持敌后抗战的解放区军民予以大力支援。中国保卫大同盟不论在人力和物力上都曾对解放区各个国际和平医院和保育机关之建设工作做了一切可能的援助。不少爱好进步与和平的国际友人，也经过宋副主席和解放区人民建立了抗日的联系，其中白求恩大夫和柯棣华大夫并为抗日事业献出了自己的生命。他们伟大的国际主义精神激励了我军民的抗日意志。这一切都同宋副主席领导下的中国保卫大同盟及其后中国福利基金会的工作分不开的。
    在这个时期中，自外界（主要是中国保卫大同盟联系的团体与个人）募捐所得款项物资均由救委会负责接收与分配，由救委会取得收据，交经手人送达捐助者手中，其收支手续和账目历来都是清楚的。“救济机关不动用救济物资”这是我们的纪律和口号。在这个时期中收到捐款约值当时蒋币七亿六千一百三十九万元，重要医药物资约三十吨。
    上海时期——一九四六年七月至一九四七年十二月。
    一九四六年七月，正当美蒋合作，表面上以北平执行部空谈停战为掩护，实际上向我人民解放军大举进攻的时候，联总经过马歇尔向周恩来将军提议邀请我方派代表参与联总运华物资之分配工作，这是有其目的和作用的。解总为了对英勇坚持敌后抗战的人民所遭受的巨大损失应进行救济，以及便于和联总行总进行交涉和斗争起见，就在上海成立了解总办事处，派解总秘书长伍云甫兼任处长，林仲为业务主任。此后的一年半当中，解总的工作重心放在上海，其主要工作是向联总行总提出关于解放区抗战损失的报告材料和进行解放区所应得救济善后物资的谈判交涉；另方面并与各解放区分会和港口办事处建立直接联系，进行联总救济物资之接收、储运和分配事宜。
    根据当时统计，全国应受救济的人口为四千二百万，其中解放区应受救济的人口为二千六百万，按照这个比例，解放区应得联总全部运华物资的五分之三。然而，由于美帝国主义的政策是利用联总救济之名而实际上则利用联总物资全力支持蒋介石打内战的；因之，八年抗战中牺牲最大，灾难最深的解放区人民，一共只收到联总五万余吨的救济物资，只合联总运华物资总数二百三十六万余吨中的百分之二。
    解总上海办事处曾对此项违反联总不歧视政策的行为，对美蒋合作、利用救济物资作军事用途的事实，对蒋美利用黄河堵口以图达到反共反人民的军事目的的阴谋，对蒋匪军事阻挠救济物资运往解放区的罪行及行总贪污盗卖救济物资等等，曾不断地进行了正义的揭露与抗议，并曾数次引起了联总职员的集体签名运动，以抗议联总当局的非法行为，这使全世界人民开始认识到在美帝操纵之下的联总对华进行所谓“救济”的目的究竟何在！
    在上海时期，解总并与中国福利基金会和基他各国际救济团体直接联系，负责处理有关解放区救济福利工作方面的联络事宜。
    石家庄和北京时期——一九四七年十二月至一九五○年四月。
    一九四七年十二月，联总在华工作结束，解总人员由上海撤回解放区，与由延安移到石家庄的解总总部合并，由熊瑾玎任副秘书长，负实际责任，开始了解总工作的第三个时期。这个时期美蒋对我进攻已在全国范围内被停止下来了，相反的，我则由防御走向全面胜利。战争异常激烈，交通阻隔，对外联络工作甚少。最初有世界学生救济会代表来解放区参观，联合国世界卫生组织和新西兰海外服务团的医务工作人员相继到和平医院服务，随后有公谊服务会运送医药物资并派遣黑热病医疗队到冀鲁豫区进行工作。一九四八年八月，联合国国际儿童急救基金会华北工作队到石家庄和解总谈判并交换谅解书，规定基金会拨款五十万美元（后增至七十五万美元），协助解放区开展妇婴儿童卫生工作。
    此项合作以后证明是极不成功的。这主要也是因为该儿童急救基金会虽系联合国组织，但仍然为美帝国主义所操纵的缘故基金会违反协议，物资来的既少且慢，质量又坏。一年工夫只运来十万五千美元的物资，不及协议总数七分之一。运来的医药物资八百二十四箱中有三百零四箱是擦手纸。该会要求成立自己独立的庞大机构，尤其坚决要求对物资和仓库的控制权。更一再以停运物资和撤退工作相威胁，最后解总被迫于一九四九年十二月三十一日发表严正声明，公布石家庄谅解失效。声明书发表后他们觉得狐狸尾巴被揭开了，只好赶紧再运来三十万美元物资。我们应当严正的警告像这样一类的为帝国主义利用的国际救济团体或个人，他们的一切阴谋诡计是注定地要失败的。
    一九四九年二月北京解放，九月解总全部搬到北京，从十月起即开始进行全国救济代表会议的筹备工作，直到今天。这就是解总以往工作的概况。
    随着革命在全国范围内取得基本胜利这一新形势的发展，给解总和整个的人民救济事业提出了新的任务和要求。首先，中华人民共和国早已成立，中国解放区救济总会这个名称已经过时了。他如性质、宗旨和任务等等当然都需要重新加以研究和改变。至于整个的人民救济事业，过去和现在一贯是为人民自己的政府所重视的，当前的救灾工作就是明证，今后也还是如此。但在今后全国统一的有利情况下，我们群众团体有关部门和公私立福利救济团体有条件也有责任大家团结起来协助政府把人民的救济和福利事业办好。根据过去解放区的救灾政策和解总本身的经验，配合今天新形势的要求，对今后的救济工作我应向各代表提供下面几点意见：
    （一）为了有计划的协助政府推进全国救济福利事业，为了加强全国各救济福利团体和政府有关部门彼此互相间的联系，应在这个大会上产生一个在新民主主义原则下的统一战线的全国性的新的救济组织及其共同遵守的新章程。它应当成为政府与人民间救济福利团体之间的桥梁，遵照政府的政策法令和大会的决议，团结全国各救济福利团体，众策群力，并在全国范围内，实行合理的分工合作，以发挥救济福利工作的最大效率。
    （二）根据目前的具体情况，美蒋摧残中国人民的创伤亟待恢复，灾荒严重地存在着，故最近一个时期内，我们应当肯定地以救济工作为重点，大力协助政府进行救灾，救济失业工人，广泛发动社会互济互助，展开节约救灾运动，利用各种方式举行募捐，组织医疗队下乡为灾难民服务。
    （三）救济工作必须与生产结合，与建设结合，把救济工作建立在全国大生产运动的基础上。由过去解放区救灾工作的经验，证明这是唯一正确的救济工作方针。
    （四）新中国的救济工作主要应倚靠发动和组织广大群众进行生产自救与节约互助。救济款物主要应在国内募集，不足时由政府补助之。我们不应倚靠外援。过去经验已充分证明，英美等帝国主义国家及其随从在中国进行所谓“救济”工作，其目的是在于为帝国主义的利益服务，而绝不会是为中国人民进行什么救济工作。最近报纸上披露美帝国主义对我国灾荒的扩大恶意宣传，不难看出他们的真正意图。还有美帝阴谋利用公私救济团体从事对新中国的阴谋活动，更是值得我们加以重视和严重警惕。
    另一方面在国际上，我们也不拒绝接受一切国际团体与人士的友好援助，但一切外来救济款物均应经过政府法定手续由这个大会所要产生的全国性的新救济机构统一批准，统一分配与使用。这是人民民主专政的国家所必须采取的措施。
