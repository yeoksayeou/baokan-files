Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 10th: A collection of short stories by Lu Xun, the founder of modern Chinese literature, has recently been published in the Soviet Union, with a print run of 150,000 copies. The collection includes several new translations of Lu Xun's works.

The preface to the collection, written by Fadeyev, Secretary-General of the Soviet Writers' Union, states: "Lu Xun is dear to us because, like our literary masters, he is a critical realist who exposed and criticized the forces of the old society, those forces that oppressed the people and suppressed the individuality of the 'common man'."
