　　County Cooperative and Farmers Sign Pre-Purchase Contracts
　　Anyang Plants 360,000 Mu of Cotton in Three Days

[Anyang News] In order to implement the resolutions of the representatives of all circles and ensure the completion of the cotton planting plan, the Anyang County Cooperative and the People's Bank branch in Pingyuan Province have vigorously supported production by successively lending 358,561 jin of fertilizer (oil cake), 300,046 jin of cotton seeds, and 619 jin of mercury preparations. The agricultural loans issued to the masses have enabled them to purchase a total of 7,309 pieces of farm tools of various sizes and 364 head of livestock. Under the guidance of the higher-level cooperative, pre-purchase contracts for cotton have been signed with cotton farmers, stipulating that after the contract is signed, the county cooperative will guarantee to purchase cotton from cotton farmers in the autumn at a ratio of eight jin of rice per jin of good lint, allowing price increases but not decreases. The masses are allowed not to sell, and the county cooperative is not allowed to refuse to buy. After the spirit of signing the contract was conveyed at the representatives' meeting, it was warmly supported by representatives from all walks of life. Contracts were signed with 71 villages, eliminating the ideological concerns of cotton farmers. The masses in each village are extremely enthusiastic about planting cotton. The entire county's cotton planting task was successfully completed in just three days, from April 16th to 18th. A total of 364,606 mu of cotton were planted on white land, and 7,055 mu of cotton were planted on wheat land, exceeding the plan by 21,661 mu. The cotton seedlings have mostly emerged and are now being prepared for thinning.
