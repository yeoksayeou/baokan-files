On the Popularization of Superior Seeds
　　Lǐ Jùn

The "Five-Year Plan for Popularizing Superior Seeds" requires that within five years, all major crops in North China be completely replaced with superior varieties, achieving a 20% increase in production. This is a serious task for agricultural work in North China in the future. Regarding this work, the following issues should be noted:

First, according to the spirit of the March North China Agricultural Technology Conference, it has been clarified that the task of "Five-Year Plan for Popularizing Superior Seeds" will be directly controlled and promoted by the agricultural departments of governments at all levels. In the past, some county agricultural departments in some areas did not pay enough attention to agricultural improvement work. They pushed the work related to agricultural extension to farms with the excuse of "not understanding technology." However, the general farm extension work adopts the method of key demonstrations and cannot comprehensively control and promote it, so the agricultural improvement movement cannot be vigorously carried out. In the future, we should resolutely change this practice. The agricultural departments of governments at all levels should regard agricultural extension as an important task, and should make concrete achievements with the "Five-Year Plan for Popularizing Superior Seeds" as one of the central tasks. With the universal control and promotion of governments at all levels, this task will surely be completed!

Second, regarding the question of what are superior seeds: In the past, when it came to superior seeds, it was those varieties with farm numbers, such as Huanong No. 4 millet, Yanda 811 millet, Okinawa No. 100 sweet potato, Qida 195 wheat, Huanong No. 5 wheat, etc. It was always thought that only those with numbers were scientific, and only those from farms were good varieties.

It is true that most of the seeds promoted by farms are good. However, because we have not promoted them for long and the quantity has not been multiplied enough, it is impossible to complete the "Five-Year Plan for Popularizing Superior Seeds" by relying on them alone. Therefore, we must pay attention to superior seeds from farmers. Our North China has such a large area, such a long history of planting crops, and such a variety of crops, there must be superior seeds! It's just that they haven't been widely discovered and promoted yet. For example, the "Shuili Station" flood-resistant millet in Xiajin County, Hebei Province; the "Kugen Valley" in Shexian County that can resist "walnut worms"; the "Sanqiuhuang" wheat stubble corn in Shenxian County that can harvest 400 jin; the "Tailihuang" millet in Zhengding County that can harvest 500 jin. The "Qinzhou Huang" millet in Qin County, Shanxi Province; the "Bian Sui Wheat" in Wendeng County, Shandong Province, and the "Lumeng" in Ju County, etc., are all excellent varieties. As long as we can deeply mobilize the masses to select seeds, we will surely be able to discover many excellent varieties.

Under our current agricultural conditions, the standards for superior seeds should not be too strict. We shouldn't hope for too much at the beginning. No matter which village's crops, there are good and bad differences. As long as we can replace the bad varieties with better varieties in a village, each mu will produce at least a few more sheng of grain! If all the crops in the villages can be completely replaced with better varieties, then the number of increased production will be very considerable. We should first do this step well, and then after the farms' experiments and research, select better varieties from various places, and then carry out seed exchange between villages, districts, and even counties. By that time, the quality of seeds will be further improved, and the increased grain production will be even greater. We have such conditions, and if we increase our confidence to do it, we are confident that we can launch a widespread mass seed selection movement!

Third, we achieved results in seed selection last year. The superior seeds that have been collected in large quantities in North China have reached 50 million jin. The superior seeds selected by farmers and stored separately are estimated to be even more. We are confident that we can complete the seed selection task on this basis.

However, precisely because we have so many seeds prepared from last year, we should start preparing now. Don't simply think that "seed selection is a task for autumn, and there is nothing to do now." Agricultural work is "a year's plan lies in the spring." Currently, the inspection, transfer, and distribution of seeds are the most important tasks. The agricultural departments of governments at all levels should make key propagation plans based on the location and quantity of superior seeds preserved last year, and organize forces to thoroughly inspect the seeds. Find out if they are mixed? Are they damp and moldy? Along with the inspection, do germination tests. Transfer and distribute the seeds that have been inspected and tested in a planned manner. The methods and procedures for these tasks must be simple and rapid, ensuring that the seeds can be distributed to farmers in time. And organize farmers to carry out careful seed selection and soaking. Pay more attention to the inspection of large quantities of seeds preserved by the public. According to past experience, some of the seeds preserved by the public are mixed; some are damp and moth-eaten.

Fourth, because this year's seed selection is large-scale and heavy in tasks, we must establish superior seed propagation areas. Focus on concentrating the superior seeds preserved in large quantities last year for centralized sowing. Select areas with suitable climate and soil, and where the masses have the habit of cultivation, and designate a village or several villages as propagation areas. The plots should be as concentrated as possible, as it is difficult to manage if they are scattered. In the propagation area and around its neighbors, do not sow similar mixed varieties in order to maintain pure varieties. This work must be carried out with in-depth publicity and mobilization, and must not be done in a coercive manner.

In addition, there are many complex tasks in the propagation area, such as delineating areas, registering land, distributing seeds (loan or exchange), temporarily exchanging land, as well as technical guidance on sowing, weeding, and preventing pests and diseases, and autumn harvesting and seed selection. It is difficult to do well by relying on cadres alone. We must organize a management committee with village cadres, labor heroes, and production models as the backbone. The management committee will then form the farmers into groups, and everyone will jointly discuss the production plan and the task of propagating superior seeds, as well as the necessary labor discipline and mutual assistance methods. For the propagation area, this work is the most basic.

The key distribution plan for the propagation area is best controlled by the special commissioner's office. This can avoid wasting too much labor in transporting seeds next spring.

Fifth, organize the propagation of superior seeds from farmers scattered in various villages. In a village, almost everyone knows which household has good seeds. The village production committee or technical research group can hold a meeting to discuss it. If there is no such organization, a superior seed propagation committee can be temporarily organized. Mobilize households with good seeds to become superior seed propagation households for the whole village, and sow them using intensive cultivation methods. If he has difficulties in labor, fertilizer, or farm tools, the committee can find a way to solve them for him. If he has excess seeds, mobilize others to exchange his seeds, which also counts as a propagation household. Strive to plant all the good seeds that can be found in the village in the fields, and plant them in good fields.

As for the standards of superior seeds, don't prescribe them too rigidly. It is best to discuss them with everyone. As long as everyone thinks it is good, it is a superior seed and can be propagated. It is also not limited to millet, cotton, or other crops. Choose whatever is needed locally. If there are really no superior seeds to choose from locally, go to other villages to exchange some superior seeds for propagation.

When mobilizing propagation households, pay attention to preventing farmers' concerns. The crops planted by the propagation households are the propagation households' own production. No one can regard them as public land. The harvested grain is still his own. When the masses exchange seeds from him in the future, they guarantee to use good quality grain. As for whether to add or how much to add, it should be fairly discussed by everyone.

Finally, the method of planting seed-retaining land should also be promoted in rural areas. All superior seed propagation households should find a small piece of good land to plant seed-retaining land. The seed-retaining land should be cultivated more carefully, and the seeds should be carefully selected. After sowing and emergence, regularly go to the field to remove miscellaneous ears and pull out diseased plants. After harvesting, dry and thresh separately, carefully select and pick again for seed retention. If you do this every year, are you still afraid of not having good seeds?

　　关于普及优种问题
    李俊
    “五年普及优种”计划，是要求在全华北，五年内把主要作物完全换成优良品种，达到增产百分之二十。这是今后全华北农业工作的一个严重任务。关于这个工作有以下几个问题是应该注意的：
    第一、根据三月华北农业技术会议的决定精神，已明确了今后“五年普及优种”的工作任务，是由各级政府农业科负责直接掌握推动的。过去有些地区的专县农业科，对农业改良工作重视不够。把有关农业推广的工作，以“不懂技术”的借口推给农场作。但是一般的农场推广工作，是采取重点示范的方法。不能全面掌握推动。使农业改良运动，不能大力展开。今后我们应该坚决转变这个作法。各级政府的农业部门要把农业推广当成重要工作任务。并且应该以“五年普及优种”为中心任务之一，作出具体成绩来。有了各级政府普遍的掌握和推动的力量，这个任务一定是能完成的！
    第二、关甚什么是优种的问题：过去一提到优种，就是那些农场带号头的品种，如华农四号谷，燕大八一一谷，冲绳一百号甘薯，齐大一九五小麦，华农五号小麦等。总以为有号头才科学，从农场出来的才是好品种。
    不错，农场推广出去的种籽，确实大部分是好的。但是因为我们推广的年月不久，数量繁殖的还不够多，单靠它来完成“五年普及优种”计划还办不到。因此，我们必须重视农家优种。咱们华北的地面这样大，种庄稼的历史这样久，庄稼又多种多样，优种一定是有的！只是还没有被广泛的发现和推广。如河北省夏津县的“水里站”抗涝谷；涉县能抗拒“核桃虫”的“苦根谷”；深县能收四百斤的“三秋黄”麦茬玉米；正定能收五百斤的“胎里黄”谷。山西省沁县的“沁州黄”谷；山东省文登县的“扁穗小麦”与莒县的“芦梦”等，都是优良品种。只要我们能深入发动群众选种，一定能发现很多的优良品种。
    在我们目前的农业条件下，优种标准也不应太严格了。我们开始作不要希望太高了。不论那一个村的庄稼，都有好和坏的差别。只要能在一个村里，把坏品种换成较好的品种，一亩地起码也要多打几升粮食吧！如果村村的庄稼，都能完全换成较好的品种。那么增产的数目字就很可观了。我们先把这一步作好，以后经过农场的试验研究，从各地选出更好的品种以后，再进行村与村、区与区，甚至于县与县换种。到那时候，种籽质量更会提高，增产粮食就更会多的。我们有这样条件，再提高信心去作，广泛的群众选种运动是有把握发动起来的！
    第三、去年我们在选种上是有成绩的，全华北已大批集中起来的优种，就有五千万斤。农家自选散存的优种，估计还多。我们在这个基础上完成选种任务，是有把握的。
    但是正因为我们有去年这样多的种籽准备，我们目前就应马上动手，作一些准备工作。不要单纯的认为“选种是秋后的工作，现在没有什么作的”。农业工作是“一年之计在于春”。在目前，对种籽的检查、调运、分发都是最重要的工作。各级政府的农业科，应根据去年保存优种的地点与数量，作出重点繁殖计划。并组织力量把种籽作个彻底检查。了解一下混杂了没有？潮湿霉坏了没有？随着检查随着就作发芽试验。把经过检查试验的种籽，有计划的调运分发。这些工作的方式和手续，必须要简明迅速。保证及时把种籽能分发到农户手里。并组织农民进行细致的选种浸种。对种籽检查，要多注意公家保存的大批种籽。根据历年的经验，公家保存的种籽，有的混杂了；有的受潮湿被虫蛀了。
    第四、因为今年的选种规模大任务重，所以必须建立优种繁殖区。有重点的，把去年大批保存的优种，进行集中播种。选择风土适宜，群众有栽培习惯的地区，划一个村或几个村为繁殖区。地块要尽量集中，分零散了很难管理。在繁殖区里面与四周邻边，不要播种类似的混杂品种，好保持纯种。这工作必须深入宣传动员，不可用强迫命令方式。
    此外在繁殖区里，还有很多的复杂工作，如划区、登记地亩、分发种籽（贷或换），临时调换土地，以及下种锄苗，防除病虫害，秋收选种等技术指导。光靠干部去作，是很难作好的。必须组织一个以村干部，劳动英雄，生产模范为骨干的管理委员会。由这个管理委员会再把农户组成小组，大家共同商订生产计划与繁殖优种任务，以及必要的劳动纪律，互助办法等。在繁殖区来讲，这个工作是最基本的。
    关于繁殖区的重点分布计划，最好由专署掌握。这样对明春调运种籽，可以避免浪费过多的劳动力。
    第五、对散在各村的农家优种，也要进行组织繁殖。一个村里，谁家有好种籽，差不多全村都知道。可由村生产委员会或技术研究小组开会讨论，如果没有这种组织，可以临时组织一个优种繁殖委员会。动员有好种籽的户，当全村的优种繁殖户，用精耕细作的方法播种。如果他在劳力、肥料、农具上有困难，可由委员会给他想法解决。如果他的种籽有多余，再动员别人换他的种籽，也算繁殖户。争取把全村能找到的好种籽都种到地里，并且种到好地里。
    至于优种的标准，不要规定的太死了。最好由大家讨论，只要大家认为是好的，就是优种，就可以加以繁殖。也不限制是谷是棉或其他，看当地需要什么，就选什么。如果当地实在没有优种可选，就到外村换些优种进行繁殖。
    在动员繁殖户的时候，要注意防止农民的顾虑。繁殖户种的庄稼，是繁殖户自己的生产。任何人不能当作公地看待。收割的粮食还是他自己的。群众将来向他换种籽，保证用成色好的现粮食。至于加不加成或加多少，应由大家公平讨论。
    最后还应该在农村里推广种留种地的办法。凡是优种繁殖户，要特别单找一小块好地种留种地。留种地要耕作的更细致，种籽都要经过精选。播种出苗以后，经常到地里去杂穗拔病棵。收割以后单晒单打，精选细挑再留种，年年这样作，还怕没好种籽吗？
