Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 14th—Tianjin has achieved great results in promoting thrift in various organs over the past four months. Most organs have greatly reduced their budget expenditures based on the spirit of careful calculation. For example, the Municipal Education Bureau reduced its annual operating expenses by one-half; the Supply Bureau saved more than 400,500 catties of millet throughout the year; and the Public Utilities Bureau reduced it by 104,000 catties of millet. The staff of the 43 units directly under the municipality generally conducted self-criticism on ideological, work style, and material conservation issues. After the launch of the conservation movement, the daily expenditure on water and electricity (including telephone bills) of the municipal units in the past four months was only more than 172,000 catties of millet, a saving of more than 36,000 catties of millet compared with December last year. Various organs have also established various systems to ensure the implementation of economy in their work. For example, it is stipulated that the purchase of materials by municipal units should be uniformly purchased by the Municipal Trust Company to ensure cost savings, eliminate corruption and waste, and complete the acquisition tasks on schedule. Since January, the Municipal Finance Bureau has implemented a contract system for the operating expenses of various organs, so that the monthly office expenses, water and electricity bills of the city's organs have saved more than 145,100 catties of millet compared with December last year. In addition, according to the statistics of 32 units, 22 units have generally established and implemented economic accounting, attendance, and material management systems.
    While carrying out the conservation movement, the factories under the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, the Industrial Bureau, and the Public Works Bureau have launched rationalization proposals, and have achieved great results in saving materials and reducing expenses. For example, in the past, the cost of automobile fuel in the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau's Automobile Company accounted for about 60 percent of the total expenditure. Since accepting the employees' suggestion to switch to mixed coal, the fuel cost only accounted for 25 percent of the total expenditure, reducing the cost by more than half.
    There are still some serious shortcomings in Tianjin's conservation work. Some organs have the problem of being tight at first and then loose, and being hot and cold intermittently. Individual organs, such as the Haihe Engineering Office, have a bias towards valuing quantity over quality in their work, resulting in serious losses and waste. Some other organs, such as the Tianjin Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, have failed to check materials in time due to the negligence of management personnel, resulting in the spoilage of a lot of public grain in the warehouse. Other cases, such as the North China Grain Corporation, have also found cases of grain damage. These phenomena have aroused the serious attention of the Tianjin leading organs and are being corrected.

　　津市各机关厉行节约
　　企业部门开展合理化建议成本降低
    【新华社天津十四日电】津市各机关推行节约四个月来已经获得很大成绩。各机关多曾根据精打细算的精神，大大紧缩开支预算。如市教育局把全年事业费缩减了二分之一；供应局全年节省四十万零五千多斤小米；公用局缩减了十万四千斤小米。市属四十三个单位的工作人员曾普遍从思想上、作风上、物资节约问题上进行了自我检讨。节约运动开展后，市属各单位四个月来，每日的水、电费支出（包括电话费）仅为十七万二千多斤小米，较去年十二月节省了三万六千多斤小米。各机关并在工作中建立了各种保证贯彻节约的制度，如市属各单位采购物资，被规定均由市信托公司统一购买，以保证节省开支、杜绝贪污浪费以及如期完成收购任务。市财政局自一月份起对各机关经费开支实行包干制，使全市各机关今年以来每月办公费和水、电费较去年十二月节省了小米十四万五千一百多斤。此外，根据三十二个单位的统计，有二十二个单位已经普遍建立和执行了经济核算、考勤、物资保管等制度。
    与开展节约运动同时，市公用局、工业局、工务局等所属各厂都展开了合理化建议运动，在节约物资和减少开支方面有很大收获。如市公用局汽车公司，过去汽车燃料成本约占总支出的百分之六十，自从接受职工建议改燃混合煤后，燃料费仅占总支出的百分之二十五，使成本降低一半以上。
    津市节约工作中还存在着一些严重缺点。某些机关存在着先紧后松、冷热不常的毛病。个别机关如海河工程处等在工作中存在重量不重质的偏向，造成了严重损失和浪费。另一些机关如天津市供销总社，由于管理人员的疏忽，没有及时核查物资，致使仓库公粮糜烂了不少。其他如华北粮食公司也发现了粮食损坏的情形。这些现象都引起了津市领导机关的严重注意，正在加以纠正。
