　　Tangshan Iron and Steel Plant Guye Refractory Material Plant Continuously Burned Six Kilns of Silica Bricks
　　Waste of National Assets Equivalent to 520,000 Jin of Rice
　　All Levels of Leadership of the Plant Should Conduct In-Depth Self-Criticism
　　[Our Tangshan News] From December 19th of last year to March 31st of this year, the Guye Refractory Material Plant, under the Tangshan Iron and Steel Plant, continuously burned six kilns of silica bricks, totaling 519 tons, wasting national property equivalent to approximately 521,387 jin of millet. This is the most serious loss suffered by the plant since its establishment in 1944.
　　On December 19th of last year, when the No. 3 kiln was unloaded, workers discovered that all the finished products in the kiln were completely burned. They reported this situation to the plant director, Zheng Liangshi. The plant director could not find the reason, nor did he investigate or report to all the workers. When the No. 2 kiln was unloaded on January 5th of this year, the finished products were burned in the same way as the No. 3 kiln. The plant director still did not discuss the reason with everyone and continued to order the workers to keep burning. Soon, No. 1 kiln and No. 10 kiln were all burned, and No. 5 kiln and No. 4 kiln were mostly burned.
　　According to the investigation and research of Dr. Zhong Xiangchong, a refractory material expert specially sent by the Iron and Steel Company to Guye for inspection, the reason for the serious cracking of silica bricks was the inappropriate selection of raw materials. The raw material used for the silica bricks in No. 1, 2, 3, and 10 kilns was Suizhong silica. This silica is a giant crystalline igneous rock vein quartz, and its physical properties and chemical composition are not suitable as the main raw material for manufacturing silica bricks. However, if it is processed and ground finely, and infiltrated in a proportion of no more than 20%, it can still be used when mixed with other materials. The plant director, Zheng Liangshi, did not understand the nature of the silica, so he bought 1,000 tons. After buying it, he used it without testing or special treatment methods. In terms of firing, the plant's temperature measurement method was inaccurate, and no standard curve was established, relying only on experience, and the plant director's experience was not rich. As a result, the four kilns were burned in this irresponsible situation.
　　The bureaucratic work style of the plant's responsible persons is the main root cause of the major losses. The plant's responsible persons have not established a clear idea of relying on workers to improve production. The Workers' Management Committee was not established until April 28th. The Party, government, and labor union held a meeting once in November of last year, but no formal meeting has been held since March of this year. There was no foundation for how to plan and promote the progress of production in the plant's leadership. The leadership rarely considered the opinions of the workers, and the work of the labor union was very weak, failing to promptly submit the workers' opinions to the administration for resolution or to mobilize the workers to inspect the administrative leadership. The workers dared to be angry but did not dare to speak out against the bureaucratic work style of the cadres.
　　After the incident, the plant director, Zheng Liangshi (who has now been transferred to the Iron and Steel Administration), had no intention of introspection or self-criticism, and even attempted to blame the workers for their unskilled firing techniques. The military representative of the plant, Du Huimin, also failed to humbly examine the incident of burning six kilns of bricks. In the past, the leadership of the Iron and Steel Plant rarely inspected the work of the Refractory Material Plant on schedule, and after the event, it did not handle it in a timely manner, causing four more kilns of bricks to be burned one after another after the No. 3 and No. 1 kilns were burned, which greatly affected the production of the Iron and Steel Plant.
　　For this serious accident of responsibility, the plant should seriously conduct self-criticism at each level, distinguish responsibilities, and propose specific improvement measures in order to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.

　　唐山制钢厂古冶耐火材料场连续烧坏六窑矽砖
　　浪费国家资财五十二万斤米
　　该厂各级领导人应深入检讨
    【本报唐山讯】唐山制钢厂所属古冶耐火材料场，白去年十二月十九日至今年三月三十一日，连续烧坏六窑矽砖，共计五百一十九吨，浪费国家财产折合小米约五十二万一千三百八十七斤。这是该场自一九四四年建场以来从未遭受的严重损失。
    去年十二月十九日，该场三号窑出窑时，工人发现全窑成品全部烧坏，当将这种情况报告场主任郑良士。场主任找不出原因，也不研究及向全体工人报告。二号窑在今年一月五日出窑时，成品与三号窑一样烧坏。场主任仍然不和大家研究原因，仍叫工人烧下去。不久一号窑、十号窑全部烧坏，五号窑、四号窑大部烧坏。
    据钢铁公司特派来古冶视察的耐火材料专家钟香崇博士调查研究的结果，矽砖严重破裂的原因，是选用原料不适当。该场一、二、三、十号四个窑的矽砖，采用的原料是绥中硅石、这种硅石是巨型结晶的火成岩脉石英，物理性质和化学成份都不宜作制造矽砖之主要原料，但如加工磨细，渗进不超过百分之二十的份量，配于其他料内，尚可应用。该场主任郑良士摸不清硅石的性质，便买来一千吨。买来后不经过化验及特殊的处置方法，即行使用。在烧火方面，该场的温度测定方法不准，没有订出标准曲线，仅凭经验办事，而该场场主任的经验并不丰富。于是，四个窑就在这种不负责的情形下被烧坏了。
    该场负责人的官僚主义作风，乃是造成重大损失的主要根源。该场负责人没有树立起依靠工人搞好生产的明确思想。工管会直到四月二十八日始建立，党、政、工三方面于去年十一月开过一次会议，直到今年三月，都没有开过一次正式会议，如何计划与推动生产的进行，在该场领导上是没有底子的。领导上对于工人的意见很少考虑，工会工作又很薄弱，未能将工人的意见迅速提交行政解决，或发动工人检查行政领导。工人对干部的官僚主义作风，敢怒而不敢言。
    事件发生后，场主任郑良士（现已调至钢铁管理局）毫无反省检讨之意，甚至企图嫁祸于工人烧火技术不精。该场军代表杜惠民对这次烧坏六窑砖的事件，也未虚心检讨。过去，制钢厂领导上很少按期检查耐火材料场的工作情况，事后，又未作及时处理，致使三号、一号两窑砖烧坏后，又接连烧坏四窑砖，使制钢厂的生产受到很大影响。
    对于这种严重的责任事故，该厂应该认真地逐级检讨，分清责任，并提出具体改善办法，以便杜绝今后类似事件的发生。
