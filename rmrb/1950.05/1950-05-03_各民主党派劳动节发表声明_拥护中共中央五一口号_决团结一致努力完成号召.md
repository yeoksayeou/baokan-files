　　Various Democratic Parties Issue Statements on Labor Day
　　Endorsing the CPC Central Committee's May 1st Slogan
　　Resolving to Unite and Strive to Complete the Call

This year's May 1st Labor Day is the first great festival after the Chinese People's Liberation War has achieved nationwide victory, and it is also the first great festival after the founding of our People's Republic of China. Celebrating this festival of the working class reviewing its fighting strength this year is more meaningful and more worthy of our joy and inspiration than ever before!

Human social culture is created by the working people, and historical development is also promoted by the working people. The Chinese people's revolutionary cause, under the leadership of the working class and its political party—the Communist Party of China, has gone through a difficult and tortuous process, and finally achieved a brilliant victory, overthrowing the reactionary rule of the combination of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and establishing a new country with the people's democratic dictatorship led by the working class, based on the worker-peasant alliance, and uniting the petty bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie. The universal truth that labor creates the world is being confirmed by the Chinese revolution we are experiencing. Therefore, when we celebrate the festival of our working people, we should pay the highest respect to the workers, peasants and all other working people of the country, as well as the defenders of the working people—the People's Liberation Army!

The Chinese working people, under the leadership of the working class and its political party, have fought firmly and unyieldingly, not only making the revolution victorious, but also gradually consolidating the victory that has been won. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, it has only been half a year, and the Central People's Government has made many brilliant achievements. Among the main ones: In the military, except for Tibet, the liberation of the entire mainland has been completed, and recently there was a successful enemy landing on Hainan Island, and the liberation of the entire island is just around the corner. In terms of finance and economy, prices that have been fluctuating for decades have been stabilized, the national financial budget is close to being balanced, the land reform in Northeast and North China has been completed, and the disaster that was once considered insurmountable has begun to be overcome. In diplomacy, fraternal friendship has been established with the socialist Soviet Union and the new democratic countries. In particular, the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has consolidated the strength of the world peace camp, curbed the ambitions of imperialist challenges, and won the environment and assistance for China's peaceful construction. In just a short period of half a year, we have completed such epoch-making achievements in history, thanks to the outstanding leadership of the working class and its political party—the Communist Party of China, and also to the creative and highly developed achievements of the Chinese working people.

Of course, we have also seen another side: the imperialists and their pawns are not reconciled to failure. US imperialism is actively assisting reactionary groups entrenched in Taiwan and is engaging in various disruptive conspiracies. At the same time, as the government vigorously promotes balancing revenue and expenditure, stabilizing prices, and unifying national financial and economic work, a few factories and shops have also closed down or reduced production, causing some workers to suffer unemployment. But these difficulties are only difficulties that are inevitably encountered in victory and progress, and they are difficulties that can be gradually overcome. The glorious victories of the People's Liberation Army on Hainan Island also empirically show that the liberation of Taiwan, Tibet, and other small islands are all agendas that will be completed in the short term. The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang will definitely not escape the fate of being completely annihilated, and the conspiracy of US imperialism will absolutely not be able to be carried out. As for the closure of a few factories and shops and the phenomenon of partial unemployment, it is also temporary. With a semi-colonial economy that has always been subordinate to imperialism and feudalism, on the one hand, the vast number of peasants are suffering from heavy exploitation and twelve years of war damage, and their purchasing power has been greatly reduced; on the other hand, the industrial and commercial sectors that have always relied on speculation and profiteering and specialize in providing corruption and enjoyment will inevitably be eliminated. Thus, a temporary economic disconnection phenomenon inevitably arises. But this is only the pain that must be experienced in the process of economic transformation and recovery. As long as our industry and commerce are reasonably adjusted, our state-owned and private economies achieve coordinated development and each gets its place, the landlord economy in rural areas across the country is eliminated, land reform is completed, and the purchasing power of peasants is generally improved; at the same time, with the mutual assistance and cooperation and support of our great ally—the Soviet Union, industry and commerce will soon fundamentally improve and develop by leaps and bounds. The process and achievements of economic transformation in Northeast China are the best practical examples. We believe that the Central People's Government not only has the confidence, but also has practical ways to overcome difficulties. We also believe that the great fighting spirit and creativity of the working people across the country can also thoroughly eliminate difficulties under the leadership of the government.

We, the various democratic parties of China, sincerely express our support for the slogans issued by the CPC Central Committee to celebrate May 1st Labor Day, especially these slogans: Support the People's Liberation Army, fight to Taiwan, and complete the complete liberation of the homeland; implement the principle of taking into account both public and private interests and benefiting both labor and capital, adjust industry and commerce, the working class unites with the national bourgeoisie, and work together to overcome temporary difficulties; implement land reform in a prepared, step-by-step, and orderly manner, and strive for a fundamental improvement in the economic situation; enhance the friendship, mutual assistance, and alliance with the Soviet Union, consolidate the world peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union, and oppose the provocateurs of new wars. We, the various democratic parties, unconditionally resolve to unite and work hard to complete these calls under the leadership of the great organizer of the people's victory, the Communist Party of China, and the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and jointly build a new China that is independent, free, democratic, unified, and prosperous. We shout:

Long live the great May 1st Labor Day—the festival of unity of the working people of China and the world!
Long live the unity and cooperation of all ethnic groups, all democratic classes, all democratic parties, and all people's organizations in China!

### 各民主党派劳动节发表声明  拥护中共中央五一口号  决团结一致努力完成号召

　　各民主党派劳动节发表声明
    拥护中共中央五一口号
    决团结一致努力完成号召
    【新华社二日讯】中国各民主党派为拥护中共中央发布庆祝五一劳动节口号发表声明如下：
    今年的五一劳动节，是中国人民解放战争已取得全国范围胜利后第一度伟大节日，也是我们中华人民共和国成立后第一度伟大节日。今年庆祝这个工人阶级检阅自己战斗力量的节日，较之以往，更具有非常丰富的意义，更值得我们欢欣与激励！
    人类社会文化是劳动人民创造的，历史发展也是劳动人民推动前进的。中国人民革命事业，在工人阶级及其政党——中国共产党领导下，走过艰难曲折的过程，终于获得辉煌的胜利，推翻了帝国主义，封建主义和官僚资本主义相结合的反动统治，建立了以工人阶级为领导的、工农联盟为基础、团结小资产阶级和民族资产阶级的人民民主专政的新国家。劳动创造世界的普遍真理正由我们亲历的中国革命过程中得到证实。因此我们庆祝劳动人民自己的节日，应以最大的衷诚向全国工人、农民和其他一切劳动人民，以及劳动人民的保卫者——人民解放军，致最崇高的敬意！
    中国劳动人民，在工人阶级及其政党领导下坚定不挠地斗争，不仅使革命已获得胜利，而且正逐步巩固已得的胜利。自中华人民共和国宣告成立到现在，为时不过半年，中央人民政府已有不少光辉的建树。择其主要的来说：在军事上除西藏外已完成全部大陆的解放，最近复有海南岛敌前登陆成功，全岛解放，指顾可期。在财政经济上，稳定了十数年波动不息的物价，使国家财政预算接近收支平衡，完成了东北华北的土地改革，开始战胜了一向认为不可战胜的灾荒。在外交上，与社会主义苏联和新民主国家建立了兄弟的友谊，特别是中苏友好同盟互助条约的缔结，巩固了世界和平阵营的力量，遏止着帝国主义挑战的野心，争取了中国和平建设的环境与援助。仅仅在半年短期中间，我们完成了这样历史上划时期的成就，是由于工人阶级及其政党——中国共产党卓越的领导，也是中国劳动人民创造性高度发挥的成就。
    自然我们也早就看到另一面：帝国主义者及其爪牙，是不甘心于失败的。美帝正积极援助反动集团负隅台湾，并肆其种种捣乱阴谋。同时在政府大力推行平衡收支、稳定物价、统一国家财经工作之际，亦有少数工厂商店停业或缩减生产，使一部工人不免感受失业痛苦。但这些困难不过是胜利与前进中必然遇到的困难，是可以逐渐克服的困难。人民解放军在海南岛的辉煌战绩，也就经验地说明解放台湾、西藏和其他小岛，都是短期即将完成的日程，蒋匪帮决难逃于彻底歼灭的命运，美帝的阴谋，是绝对无法施逞的。至于少数工厂商店停业与部分失业现象，亦是属于暂时的。以一个一向从属于帝国主义封建主义的半殖民地经济，一方面是广大农民遭受着重重剥削与十二年来战争的损害，购买力大大降低；一方面是向来依靠投机牟利和专供腐化享乐的工商部门，必然地遭受淘汰。于是不可避免地产生暂时经济脱节现象。但这只是经济改造与恢复过程中必然经历的痛苦。只要我们的工商业得到合理的调整，我们的国营和私营经济做到配合发展、各得其所，全国农村地主经济消灭，土地改革完成，农民购买力普遍提高；同时在我们伟大的盟国——苏联的互助合作和支援下，工商业不久便可根本好转，大步向前发展。东北经济改造的过程与成绩，即是现实最好的例证。我们相信中央人民政府不仅有信心，而且有实际战胜困难的办法。我们更相信全国劳动人民的伟大斗争性与创造性的发挥，也能在政府领导之下，彻底消灭困难。
    我们中国各民主党派，衷诚表示拥护中共中央发布的庆祝五一劳动节口号，特别是这几个口号，即：支援解放军，打到台湾去，完成国土全部解放；贯彻公私兼顾、劳资两利，调整工商业，工人阶级联合民族资产阶级，协力渡过暂时困难；实行有准备有步骤有秩序的土地改革，争取经济状况的根本好转；增进中苏友好互助盟谊，巩固苏联为首的世界和平民主阵营，反对新战争的挑拨者。我们各民主党派无条件地决在伟大人民胜利组织者中国共产党与伟大的中国人民领袖毛主席领导之下，团结一致，努力完成这些号召，共同建设独立、自由、民主、统一与富强的新中国。我们高呼：
    伟大的五一劳动节——全中国与全世界劳动人民团结的节日万岁！
    全中国各民族各民主阶级各民主党派各人民团体的团结合作万岁！
