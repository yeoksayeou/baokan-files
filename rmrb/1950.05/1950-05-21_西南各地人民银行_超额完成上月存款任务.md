　　Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 15th: All branches of the People's Bank of China in the Southwest region have exceeded their deposit absorption targets for April. As of April 29th, the entire region had exceeded the head office's April deposit absorption target by 72.8 percent, an increase of 65.3 percent compared to March. Among them, the Chongqing branch exceeded the target by 66.1 percent, the Western Sichuan branch by 46.8 percent, the Southern Sichuan branch by 13.4 percent, the Northern Sichuan branch by 264 percent, and the Guizhou branch by 42.1 percent. The reason why the above deposit targets were exceeded is mainly due to the increasing stability of prices after the unification of financial and economic work, and the greatly increased trust of the broad masses of people in the Renminbi. The Chengdu branch's private deposits in April increased by 10.3 times compared to February, which is one example. Secondly, cash management work has been gradually carried out, and the cash income and expenditure of institutions and public enterprises through banks has been increasing. Thirdly, the branches in various places have organized a large number of deposits through various businesses and strengthened ties with the masses and promoted policies, initially dispelling the various concerns of some private industrial and commercial households about depositing money in state banks.

　　西南各地人民银行
    超额完成上月存款任务
    【新华社重庆十五日电】西南区各地中国人民银行均已超额完成了四月份的吸收存款任务。截至四月二十九日止，全区已超过总行所给四月份的吸收存款任务百分之七十二点八，较三月份增加了百分之六十五点三。其中重庆分行超过任务百分之六十六点一，川西分行超过任务百分之四十六点八，川南分行超过任务百分之十三点四，川北分行超过任务百分之二百六十四，贵州分行超过任务百分之四十二点一。上述存款任务所以能超额完成，主要是由于财经工作统一后物价日趋稳定，广大人民对人民币的信任大为提高。成都分行四月份私人存款较二月份增加了十点三倍，就是一个例证。其次是现金管理工作已逐步开展，机关和公营企业的现金收支通过银行的已日渐增多。再次是各地分行通过各种业务，大批组织存款，并加强联系群众与宣传政策，初步解除了部分私营工商业户存款于国家银行的种种顾虑。
