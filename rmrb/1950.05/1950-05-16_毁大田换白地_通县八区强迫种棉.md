Destroying Fields of Grain to Create Bare Land
Tong County's Eighth District Forcibly Plants Cotton

To the Editorial Comrades:

The cotton planting work in the Eighth District of Tong County, Hebei Province, was carried out without sufficient preparation in advance. When the time came, the masses were forced to plant cotton, resulting in the serious consequence of destroying fields of grain.

The district planned to plant 16,200 mu of cotton. Because sufficient mobilization and preparation work had not been done in advance, the bare land left by the masses was very little, and some of the cotton seeds were loaned out relatively late. When the time came, there was a danger of not completing the plan; at the same time, the county was urging very tightly. Therefore, on April 22, the district government issued a mandatory order to the village governments and peasant representative meetings, prohibiting the sowing of grain in the fields. The district committee also issued instructions to the village branches: "We must guarantee the completion of the numbers, or it will not be acceptable!" In addition, the distribution of the cotton planting plan was subjectively assigned to each village, and the district cadres were divided up to deploy the plan in each village.

Civil Affairs Assistant Wang Zhenjiang went to Xiaoqiao Village to deploy the plan. At this time, Xiaoqiao Village had already planted 227 mu of cotton. Wang Zhenjiang then instructed the village to plant another 173 mu to make up 400 mu. The village cadres asked, "What if the masses have no bare land?" Wang Zhenjiang replied, "No matter what, the task must be completed! Those who have no bare land should exchange with those who have bare land, and it doesn't matter if the fields of grain of those who don't exchange are destroyed." Subsequently, a mass meeting was held, and the district and village cadres forced the masses to report their land. The masses were forced to report some more. This increased the masses' concerns, and the cotton planting plan could not be realized.

When the Mopu Village branch received the instructions from the district, it saw that they were very strict and that it would not be acceptable if the plan was not completed. So they told the villagers the number of mu of cotton planting assigned by the district: "Our village has already planted 72 mu, and the district is asking our village to plant another 90 mu." After hearing this, the villagers were unwilling to plant any more, and some said, "Let's see how much you (referring to the village cadres) plant?" When the village cadres and party members saw that the masses were watching and not completing the task, they were afraid of being criticized by their superiors. Helplessly, Public Security Officer Shao Zhenqi (a party member) destroyed one and a half mu of corn that had already been planted; Cai Jingrong also destroyed one mu of fields of grain.

### 毁大田换白地　通县八区强迫种棉

　　毁大田换白地
　　通县八区强迫种棉编辑同志：
    河北省通县八区种棉工作，事先没作充分准备，事到临头强迫群众种棉，造成了毁坏大田的严重恶果。
    该区计划种一万六千二百亩棉花，因为事先没作好动员准备工作，群众留下的白地很少，又加部分棉籽贷放的较晚，事到临头，有完不成计划的危险；同时县里督促的又很紧，因此，该区区政府就于四月二十二日，便向各村村政府、农代会发出了一道强迫命令的通知，禁止大田播种。该区区委会也向各村支部发出指示：“一定要保证完成数字，完不成不行！”另外对种棉计划的分布，也是主观的给各村摊派的数字，让全区干部分头到各村布置。
    民政助理员王振江到小桥村去布置。这时小桥村就已经种上二百二十七亩棉花了，王振江又布置叫该村再种一百七十三亩；凑够四百亩。该村干部提出：“群众没白地了怎么办！”王振江回答说：“不管怎么办，得完成任务！没白地的和有白地的主调换，不换的毁大田也不用管他。”随后召开了群众大会，区村干部硬逼着群众自报，群众被迫不得已，又报了些。这样群众的顾虑更增加了，种棉计划更没法实现。
    么铺村支部接到区里的指示，一看很严格，完不成计划不行，就对村民把区里分配的种棉亩数一说：“咱村已经种上七十二亩了，区里又叫咱村种九十亩。”村民听后不愿意再种了，有的就说：“看你们（指村干部）种多少？”村干部、党员见群众观望起来，不完成任务又怕上级批评，无奈何，公安员邵振起（党员）就把已经种上的一亩半玉米毁了；蔡景荣也毁了一亩大田。
