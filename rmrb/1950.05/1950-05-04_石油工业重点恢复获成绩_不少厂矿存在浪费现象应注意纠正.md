　　Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Significant progress has been made in the key restoration work of the national petroleum industry. In the Northeast region, the Fushun Oil Refinery has two plants, east and west. During the Japanese puppet regime, the highest annual output reached over 300,000 tons. After liberation in November 1948, the plant was shut down for three months due to the severe sabotage by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Thorough repairs were carried out, and one-third of the equipment in the west plant had been put into operation successively by September last year. With the active efforts of all employees, last year's crude oil production target was successfully completed. This year's crude oil production plan is doubled compared to last year. The Northeast has a relatively good foundation for synthetic petroleum industry. If its equipment can be fully restored and utilized, the annual output may exceed the level of the Japanese puppet regime. The Jinzhou Synthetic Oil Plant will resume half of its operations in October this year. The Jinxi, Siping, and Jilin plants also underwent repairs during the保管period. The Dalian Refinery has been actively repaired and started production in February this year.

　　The Northwest region is an area with relatively abundant natural petroleum reserves in China. Currently, oil is extracted and refined in Yumen, Usu, and Yan'an. The Yumen Oil Mine is a large oil mine in China. After liberation in October 1949, production has not stopped. Due to insufficient original oil storage equipment, transportation and sales are still difficult. The daily processing volume is still maintained at the pre-liberation figure, which is only four-sevenths of the mine's equipment capacity. However, with the timely repair and maintenance of the machinery by all employees, the number of days for each furnace operation has increased compared to before liberation, thus increasing the output. Taking the average of the three months from October to December after liberation, the daily output of gasoline and kerosene has increased by more than 25% compared to the daily average output of the nine months before liberation. The solvent oil recovery plant and centrifugal dewaxing plant of the mine are being rushed to repair and trial run, striving for official production on "May 1st" this year, and the product quality will be improved compared to the past. The Yan'an Petroleum Plant was damaged during the Kuomintang bandit army's attack in 1947, but the main equipment and materials were basically preserved due to the prior transfer of fortifications by all employees and their heroic armed protection of the plant. After the bandit army retreated, production was quickly restored and gradually increased. In 1949, crude oil production increased more than threefold compared to the previous year, and the production rate of gasoline and kerosene also increased by 13% compared to the previous year.

　　After the liberation of Shanghai, the kerosene plants established during the Japanese puppet occupation were almost completely destroyed. After supplementing the equipment of the original China Petroleum Company's oil storage depot, production has begun with the efforts of all workers in construction.

　　In the process of restoration, the awareness of the broad masses of employees has been continuously improved, and they have demonstrated a high degree of production enthusiasm. When the employees of Yan'an restored production in 1948, because the houses and kangs were all destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan's bandit troops, they would rather sleep in the underground of abandoned cave dwellings than delay production. At that time, the plant was in financial difficulty, and even only food was provided for half a year without paying wages, but the workers had no complaints. The employees of the Yumen Oil Mine braved the severe cold of minus 20 to 30 degrees Celsius to rush to repair the oil pipeline, completing the work in two days that used to take eight to ten days. Last year, all the employees of the mine salvaged more than 200 tons of usable equipment from the waste pile, which greatly helped the construction of the mine. The employees of the Shanghai China Petroleum Company completed the construction project originally planned for ten months in five months, and cleared 14,600 meters of usable steel pipes and 120 tons of steel plates for oil pools from the waste products.

　　However, at present, the enterprise management of various factories and mines is far from adequate, and the phenomenon of waste is very serious. The output of fuel oil from the Yumen Refinery accounts for 54% of its crude oil output, but there is a lot of waste in the use of these fuel oils. If careful calculations are made, waste is eliminated, and necessary equipment is added, the gasoline production rate can be increased. The Fushun Refinery uses crude oil as fuel oil for gasoline, consuming about 3,000 tons of crude oil every year. As for the waste of labor, transportation, materials, etc., it is also very serious. To eliminate these wasteful phenomena, the concept of cherishing national property and resources should be established in the minds of cadres, and strict economic accounting, quota management, and cost reduction should be implemented in the work, and democratic management should be resolutely implemented.

### 石油工业重点恢复获成绩  不少厂矿存在浪费现象应注意纠正

　　石油工业重点恢复获成绩
    不少厂矿存在浪费现象应注意纠正
    【新华社三十日讯】全国石油工业重点恢复工作，已取得显著成绩。在东北区，石油炼厂抚顺制油厂，分东西两厂，伪满时期最高年产量曾达三十余万吨。一九四八年十一月解放后，由于蒋匪军的严重破坏，该厂曾停工三月，进行彻底检修，去年九月西厂已有三分之一设备先后开工，在全体职工积极努力下，去年原油生产任务已胜利完成。今年原油产量计划比去年提高一倍。东北人造石油工业较有基础，其设备如能全部恢复并充分利用，年产可能超过伪满时期的水平。锦州合成油厂今年十月将复工一半。锦西、四平、吉林厂等在保管期间也进行了修理。大连炼油厂经积极修复，今年二月已开始生产。
    西北区为我国天然石油藏量较丰之区，现已采炼者计玉门、乌苏、延长等地。玉门油矿为我国一较大油矿，一九四九年十月解放后，迄未停止生产，因原有储油设备不足，运销尚有困难，每日处理量仍维持解放前数字，即仅及该矿设备能量的七分之四。但在全体职工及时检修爱护机器的情况下，每次开炉日数已较解放前增多，因而产量为之提高，以解放后十月至十二月三个月的平均，日产汽油与煤油数量已较解放前九个月的每日平均产量提高了百分之二十五以上。该矿溶济油收回厂及离心去腊厂正抢修试炉中，争取今年“五一”正式生产，产品品质将较过去提高。延长石油厂于一九四七年国民党匪军进攻时曾遭破坏，但主要设备与器材，由于全体职工的事前转移坚壁及其英勇的武装护厂，得以基本保全，匪军溃退后，即迅速恢复生产，并逐步提高。一九四九年原油产量较上年度已增加三倍有余，汽油与煤油生产率亦较上年度提高百分之十三。
    上海解放后，日伪占领期间建立的煤油厂已破坏殆尽，经将原中国石油公司的储油所设备补充后，在全体工人努力修建下，已开始生产。
    在恢复过程中，广大职工的觉悟程度不断提高，发挥了高度的生产积极性。延长职工于一九四八年恢复生产时，因房子、炕全部为蒋胡匪军破坏，宁肯睡在废窑洞的地下，而从不耽误生产。当时厂内资金困难，甚至在半年内只有饭吃，暂不发薪，工人也毫无怨言。玉门油矿职工不避零下二三十度的严寒，抢修输油管，两天即完成过去八天至十天的工作。该矿全体职工曾于去年自废品堆中检出可用的器材二百余吨，大大帮助了该矿的建设。上海中国石油公司职工曾在五个月内完成原计划十个月的修建工程，并自废品中清出可用的钢管一万四千六百公尺及油池钢板一百二十吨。
    但目前各厂矿经营企业化做得很不够，浪费现象也很严重。玉门炼厂的燃料油产量占其原油产量的百分之五十四，而对于这些燃料油的使用上却有很大的浪费，如能精打细算，消灭浪费及增加必要设备，则可提高汽油之生产率。抚顺炼油厂把原油当成汽油的燃料油使用，每年耗费原油约达三千余吨。至于劳动力、运输力、器材等的浪费也很严重。这些浪费现象的消除，应在干部思想上树立爱护国家财产资源的观念，并在工作中实行严格的经济核算、定额管理，减低成本，坚决贯彻民主管理。
