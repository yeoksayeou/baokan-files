　　Cultivating Backbone in Workers' Education
    Worker School Teacher Training Class Opens
    Over Eighty Students to Study for Two Weeks
    [Beijing News Agency] The "Beijing Worker School Teacher Training Class," jointly organized by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to develop worker education in various districts and industries, held its opening ceremony on the 8th at the "Workers' Cultural Palace." This training class will provide worker schools with permanent teachers, and enable them to gain a correct understanding of politics, ideology, and professional skills, and then gradually improve in their work, becoming the backbone of worker education. At the ceremony, Weng Dujian, Director of the Bureau of Culture and Education, spoke. He first clarified the importance of worker education, saying: Workers are the main force in New China's production and construction, and 50 to 70 percent of the working people are illiterate or semi-literate, so it is urgent to help them learn culture. Secondly, raising cultural levels will more quickly improve political and technical levels, and better serve the cause of production. He pointed out the understanding and preparation that worker education workers should have, first of all, to establish a worldview of serving the people, not just focusing on personal interests, but subordinating personal interests to the interests of the broad masses of the people, and thinking more for the broad masses of working people. Regarding the question of "can serving as a worker teacher be regarded as a profession or lifelong career?" Director Weng believes that from the perspective of the importance of worker education, it is possible. To transform China from an agricultural country into an industrial country, we must first eliminate illiteracy among workers. Only after the cultural level of workers is improved can technology and understanding be improved. Today's work is the beginning of raising the cultural level of the working class. Therefore, being a teacher of the people—more specifically, being a teacher of workers—can be a profession or even a lifelong career. Next, Feng Suhai, Deputy Director of the Culture and Education Department of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, said that we should break the past erroneous view that "all professions are inferior, only studying is superior." We must humbly learn from workers, undergo a major ideological transformation, and serve workers with the attitude of a service worker. Xiao Ming, Vice Chairman of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, warmly welcomed intellectuals to participate in worker education, and transform themselves through work. This work should be closely integrated with trade union work. He also emphasized that teaching should be approached with the attitude of "knowing when you know, and not knowing when you don't know" and "teaching benefits both the teacher and the student," and not be self-righteous. Teaching should be linked to practice to achieve appropriate results.
    The training class has more than eighty students, with Hu Zhen from the Culture and Education Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and Li Yifan from the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education serving as the director and deputy director. The study time is fourteen days, with six hours of classes and discussions each day. The content of the study includes: the purpose, attitude, and methods of learning, the cultural and educational policies of New Democracy, the importance, characteristics, present and future of worker education, teaching methods, working methods, and current affairs reports.

　　培养工人教育工作中的骨干
    工人学校教员训练班开学
    学生八十余人学习期限两周
    【京市新闻处讯】京市文教局和市总工会为了开展各区行业工人教育工作而合办的“北京市工人学校教员训练班”于八日在“劳动人民文化宫”举行开学典礼。通过此训练班，将使工人学校有固定的教员，并使他们在政治、思想和业务上获得正确的认识，然后不断在工作中逐步提高，成为工人教育工作中的骨干。举行典礼时，文教局翁独健局长讲话。他首先阐明了工人教育的重要性，他说：工人是新中国生产建设的主力军，而劳动人民中百分之五十到百分之七十都是文盲或半文盲，因此应迫切地帮助他们学习文化。其次，提高了文化，将更快地提高政治与技术水平，更好地服务于生产事业。他指出工人教育工作者应有的认识与准备，首先要树立为人民服务的人生观，不要只计较个人的利益，应把个人利益服从于广大人民的利益，多为广大的劳苦人民着想。对于“充当工人教员是否可以作为专业或终身事业呢？”这一问题，翁局长认为从工人教育的重要性来看是可以的。要把中国从农业国变为工业国，首先必须扫除工人中的文盲，在工人的文化水平提高之后，才能提高技术和认识。今天的工作正是提高工人阶级文化水平的开始。因此，做人民的教师——更具体的说，做工人的教师是可以作为专业甚至于成为终身事业的。接着，全国总工会文教部副部长冯宿海说，应该打破过去“万般皆下品，惟有读书高”的错误的看法。虚心向工人学习，在思想上来一个大翻身，以勤务员的态度来为工人服务。北京市总工会副主席萧明在讲话中热烈欢迎知识分子来参加工人教育的工作，从工作中改造自己。这工作要与工会工作密切结合。他并强调地指出教学应抱着“知之为知之，不知为不知”和“教学相长”的态度，不要自以为是。在教学中应联系实际，这样才能收到适当的效果。
    训练班共有学员八十余人，由市总工会文教部胡镇和市文教局李一帆任正副班主任。学习时间为十四天，每天上课和讨论六小时。学习内容包括：学习的目的、态度与方法，新民主主义的文化教育政策，工人教育的重要性、特点、现在与将来，教学方法，工作方法和时事报告等。
