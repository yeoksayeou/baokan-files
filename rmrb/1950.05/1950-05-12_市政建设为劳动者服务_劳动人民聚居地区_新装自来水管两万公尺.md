　　New Water Pipes Installed for 20,000 Meters
    [Report from this newspaper] Beijing's large-scale tap water renovation project is proceeding in accordance with the principle of serving the working people. Since February, the water company has started work on more than 30 streets and alleys. Currently, about 11,000 meters of branch pipe projects have been completed in Dongxiaoshi Street, Nan Shuidaozi, Mingyin Temple, Luban Guan, and 26 or 27 hutongs, as well as about 9,000 meters of main pipe projects in Nanbei Gouyan and from Niujie to Yongan Road. In the past, most of the nearly 800 kilometers of main and branch water pipes and user water pipes that had been built over the years were concentrated in the eastern part of the inner city—where reactionary rulers and "superior Chinese" gathered. For the convenience of these people, there are countless examples of four or five branch pipes running parallel on the same street. However, in the areas west of Xuanwumen to Xinjiekou, the outer city area, and the fringes of various cities where the laboring people are densely populated, there are very few or even no water pipes. These working people had to draw water from "wells where dead cats, dead dogs, and even infant corpses are often found" or spend four or five times more money than tap water to buy water containing a large number of miscellaneous bacteria from private wells. The broad masses of working people were constantly under the threat of disease and death. The fact that the disease and mortality rates in the old tenth and twelfth districts have been higher than in other districts over the years is inseparable from the drinking water problem. This is the evil result of the deformed construction that has consistently served the ruling class for more than 40 years. The current water pipe installation project has changed this unreasonable situation and is now geared towards the working people. After the completion of the main pipe projects in Nanbei Gouyan and Niujie, as well as the Dongxiaoshi project, residents of nearly 50 hutongs in the vicinity will be able to install tap water in their homes for the first time within the year, and the water supply situation for residents of 30 hutongs will be improved. New tap water has been installed in Beida Siao Tiao Hutong, Zhongjie, Jiulianzi Hutong inside Hepingmen, Songshu Hutong, and Nanshuncheng Street inside Fuchengmen, all in Xinjiekou. The projects under renovation or about to start soon include Jian Guo Chang and Xueyuan Hutong in Xicheng District, as well as Biaogan Hutong, Shang Tangdao, and Xia Tangdao outside Chongwenmen. The unreasonable facts of the past cannot be completely changed in the short term. The water company plans to add 200 retail water stations and renovate 170 private water wells in areas densely populated by working people within the year, allowing them to sell tap water on their behalf. At present, nearly 92 retail water stations in Wanggongchang in Xuannei, Houchi West Street in Dongxiaoshi, and 40 private water well renovation projects have been completed. Once all the above projects are completed, more than 300,000 working people (the water-using population last year was about 530,000) can improve their water hygiene.

### 市政建设为劳动者服务　劳动人民聚居地区　新装自来水管两万公尺

　　市政建设为劳动者服务
　　劳动人民聚居地区         
　　新装自来水管两万公尺
    【本报讯】京市大规模的自来水装修工程，已依照为劳动人民服务的方针进行。从二月份起，自来水公司先后在三十余条街巷动工，现已完成东晓市大街，南水道子，明因寺，鲁班馆及廿六、七条胡同的约一万一千米的支管工程，南北沟沿，牛街到永安路的约九千米的干管工程。过去历年所修建的近八百公里的干支水管和用户水管，多数集中在内城的东部——反动统治者和“高等华人”聚集的地方。为着这些人的方便，四、五条支管同在一条街上并行的例子，举不胜举。而在劳动人民所密集的宣武门至新街口以西地区，外城地区和各城的边沿地带，水管极少甚至没有。这些劳动人民只好从“时常发现死猫、死狗甚至婴儿尸体的水井”里打水吃，或多花比自来水贵四、五倍的钱去私营水井买含着大量杂菌的水吃。广大劳动人民整日处在疾病与死亡的威胁中。旧第十、十二等区历年来的疾病、死亡率要比其他各区为高的事实，是与饮水问题分不开的。这正是四十余年来一贯为统治阶级服务的畸形建设的恶果。现在所进行的按装水管工程却改变了这种不合理的情况，而面向劳动人民了。南北沟沿和牛街的干管工程以及东晓市的工程完成后，在年内可使左近五十条胡同的居民，第一次在自己的住所按装上自来水；并改善对三十条胡同居民的供水情况。已经装好的有新街口北大四条胡同、中街、和平门内旧帘子胡同、松树胡同、阜成门内南顺城街，正在装修或不久即将动工的有西城拣果厂、学院胡同，以及崇文门外标杆胡同、上唐刀、下唐刀等地的工程。过去的不合理的事实不是短期内可以完全改变的。自来水公司计划在劳动人民密集的地方，于年内增设二百处零售水站，改装私营水井一百七十处，让他们代售自来水。目前完已成了宣内王公厂、东晓市后池西街等地的近九十二处零售水站和四十处私营水井的改装工程。一俟上述工程全部完成，可使三十余万劳动人民（去年用水人口约为五十三万）改善用水卫生。
