Comrade Deng Yingchao's Report on the Marriage Law

[This newspaper dispatch] To understand the women's work in Zhangjiakou City and Chahar Province, Deng Yingchao, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, went to Zhangjiakou City on May 12. On the morning of the 14th, she gave a report on the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China in the city. More than 7,000 people, including heads and cadres of various organs, schools, and troops in Chahar Province and Zhangjiakou City, as well as trainees, attended the lecture. The meeting was presided over by the Chahar Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. Her report was divided into three parts: (1) How the Marriage Law was produced; (2) The main content of the Marriage Law; (3) How to implement the Marriage Law. The following is a summary of the report:

(1) How the Marriage Law was produced

The formulation, promulgation, and implementation of the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China is one of the fruits of the long-term struggle of the Chinese working people and the victory of the People's Great Revolution and the People's Liberation War. It is the product of the new political and economic foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship established after expelling imperialism, overthrowing reactionary rule, and implementing land reform in some areas. It is the concentrated expression of the demands of the broad masses of awakened working people, especially the broad masses of working women. After seventeen months, the competent and relevant authorities, based on the basic principles of abolishing the feudal marriage system, implementing freedom of marriage, equality of men and women, and protecting the interests of women and children, and according to the collected marriage materials from urban and rural areas, with reference to the marriage laws of various liberated areas, as well as the marriage laws of the Soviet Union and new democratic countries, and after soliciting the opinions of various democratic parties, people's organizations, and judicial organs, and holding multiple discussions and repeated research, the law was formulated. It was approved and promulgated by the seventh meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, and Chairman Mao Zedong issued an order to implement it from May 1, 1950. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China notified the whole Party to ensure its implementation, pointing out that Communist Party members should unanimously support and abide by it. This Marriage Law not only completely negates the feudal marriage system, but also fundamentally differs from the so-called "free and equal" marriage laws of capitalist societies and the marriage laws under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. However, it is not entirely the same as today's marriage law of the socialist Soviet Union. The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China is a New Democratic marriage law that conforms to China's national conditions and is in line with the times and needs. It represents the vital interests of the vast married and unmarried men and women in Chinese cities and villages, especially women, and at the same time takes into account the situation of revolutionary soldiers and all ethnic groups, as well as the happiness of the next generation. It has both thorough destructiveness towards the feudal system and active constructiveness towards the new democratic marriage system. After the promulgation of this Marriage Law, all men and women laboring people, especially women who have suffered the most pain and sacrifice, who have been oppressed by the feudal marriage system for thousands of years, will gain liberation and freedom in marriage. However, some people do not look at the entire content of the Marriage Law in connection, but rather view the problem one-sidedly, in isolation, or even out of context, thus leading to many incorrect understandings. Therefore, it is even more necessary to conduct extensive and in-depth publicity and explanation.

(2) The main content of the Marriage Law

The principle of formulating the Marriage Law is clearly stipulated in the first chapter in Article 1: Abolishing the feudal marriage system of arranged and forced marriages, male superiority over female, and disregard for the interests of children. Implementing the new democratic marriage system of freedom of marriage for men and women, monogamy, equality of rights between men and women, and protection of the legitimate interests of women and children. Article 2 prohibits bigamy, concubinage, child brides, interference with the freedom of widows to remarry, and prohibits anyone from extorting property through marriage relationships. The spirit of these two principles runs through the entire Marriage Law. Implementing freedom of marriage includes both freedom of marriage and freedom of divorce (see Article 3 in Chapter 2 and Article 17 in Chapter 5 of the Marriage Law). However, it also requires both men and women to adopt a cautious attitude towards marriage and divorce (see Articles 4, 5, and 6 in Chapter 2 and the divorce provisions in Article 17 in Chapter 5), and opposes triviality and rashness. In the mediation and judgment of marriage cases, a serious, cautious, investigative, research-based, reasonable, and responsible attitude should be adopted to solve problems.

Why does Article 17 stipulate that if one party resolutely demands a divorce and mediation is ineffective, a divorce shall be granted? This article was formulated based on the demands of women in rural and urban areas, especially the broad masses of working women after the implementation of land reform. According to statistics from eight cities including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Xi'an, and Harbin, marriage cases account for 11.9% to 48.9% of civil cases. In rural areas of Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, and other places, marriage cases account for 33.3% to 99% of civil cases. Among marriage cases, divorce and annulment of marriage contracts account for 51% to 84% in the above-mentioned cities and 54% in rural areas. The main reasons for divorce include arranged marriages, oppression, buying and selling, abuse, early marriage, bigamy, adultery, abandonment, etc., accounting for 78% to 82%. The party initiating the divorce is mainly the woman, accounting for 68% to 92%. The parties involved in these cases are overwhelmingly young and middle-aged working people. Therefore, the above materials prove that the provisions of Article 17 are beneficial to the broad masses of women, and legal procedures such as mediation and judgment are required to ensure the correct realization of this freedom.

Will the provisions of Article 17 cause hasty divorces and social chaos? Judging from the principles and content of each chapter stipulated in the entire Marriage Law, as long as it is correctly implemented, it will not only enable the lives of men and women and their children to move towards happiness, but it is also an effective way to eliminate the chaos in male-female relationships in the old society. The existing marital chaos phenomena are due to the following reasons: (1) The existence of the feudal marriage system, lack of freedom of marriage, especially lack of freedom of divorce, which is the most basic and most important; (2) Certain side effects brought about by revolutionary actions to break the old marriage system, such as misunderstanding freedom of marriage as casual marriage, and thus male-female relationships become casual and chaotic; (3) The reason of long-term war; (4) The "left" or "right" deviations in the implementation of the policy of freedom of marriage. Therefore, only by correctly implementing the Marriage Law in its entirety and starting from education and cultivation of new social morality can we eliminate all kinds of chaotic phenomena in male and female marriage during the transition period.

Chapters 3 and 4 of the Marriage Law, a total of ten articles, define the rights and obligations between husband and wife and the relationship between parents and children. This is to consolidate the relationship between husband and wife and establish a happy, pleasant, and beautiful family. There is a fundamental difference in nature between married life and premarital life. Most people do not pay enough attention to married life. Some people only value premarital love life and ignore how to establish good relationships and harmonious lives between husband and wife after marriage, which leads to friction, disputes, conflicts, and even develops into divorce factors. In fact, married life is more complicated than premarital life, and its influence extends to all aspects of husband and wife, children, family, comrades, friends, career, and society, and becomes increasingly complex with the continuation of married life. Therefore, both men and women after marriage should be good at handling it.

The spirit of emphasizing the protection of the legitimate rights and interests of women and children while taking care of all aspects is clearly manifested in the Marriage Law. Such as the relationship between husband and wife, parents, children, marriage, the relationship between the two parties after divorce, and the handling of property. Why should we focus on protecting the legitimate rights and interests of women and children? This is precisely the specific practice of combining the principle of equality between men and women with China's actual situation, and it is also the concretization of the Common Program in the Marriage Law, which is beneficial to both men and women and society. Because women's liberation is the measure of social liberation, and children's happiness is the manifestation of social progress.

(3) How to implement the Marriage Law

The formulation of the Marriage Law itself has gone through a process of struggle with various ideas; and its implementation requires a long-term and multi-faceted struggle process. Because the formulation and promulgation of a law or resolution is only the beginning of the problem being solved, it does not mean that it has been completely solved and realized. To ensure the effective implementation of the Marriage Law, on the one hand, we must continuously promote new customs and foster a social environment conducive to freedom of marriage among the broad masses of men and women; on the other hand, it depends on whether cadres can correctly understand, skillfully grasp, and resolutely implement the Marriage Law. This is the primary and decisive key. Therefore, we must first carry out the work of eliminating feudal remnants of thought among cadres, overcome certain phenomena of arranged and forced marriages among cadres (such as interfering with others' marriage and divorce, or controlling that women in this village cannot marry people from other villages, etc.); and we must seriously study the Marriage Law. We must recognize that the Marriage Law and our marriage policy are major issues related to the interests of millions of people, and regard ensuring the correct implementation of the Marriage Law as one of the important tasks at present and on a regular basis. To this end, the Party, government, army, people, and relevant departments at all levels should specifically organize communication and study, conduct in-depth publicity and long-term education among the masses, promote and rely on the consciousness of the masses to solve their own problems; avoid starting from subjective wishes and charitable views, and prevent the occurrence of coercive orders. We must advocate freedom of social interaction between men and women and freedom of love for unmarried men and women. As long as the interaction and love between men and women do not hinder study and work, we should not be alarmed or interfere. Only in this way can we prepare a good social environment for the implementation of freedom of marriage. Men and women who make friends and talk about love should understand each other, establish friendship and love in common work or study, and then strive for a common cause. It is incorrect to start purely from sexual love or from other material conditions or petty-bourgeois love supremacy. Women's liberation must rely on the struggle of women themselves, and first of all, improve their status in all aspects by striving to participate in various construction undertakings, so as to break the shackles of feudal marriage. The correct implementation of the Marriage Law will have a good impact, as the CPC Central Committee’s notice said: "The correct implementation of the Marriage Law will not only liberate the Chinese men and women masses - especially the women masses - from the barbaric and backward old marriage system of thousands of years, but also establish a new marriage system, new family relations, new social life, and new social morality, so as to promote the development of new democratic China's political construction, economic construction, cultural construction, and national defense construction."

　　邓颖超同志关于婚姻法的报告
    【本报讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会副主席邓颖超为了了解张家口市及察哈尔省妇女工作，于五月十二日赴张家口市。十四日上午在该市作了关于中华人民共和国婚姻法的报告。出席听讲的有察省、张市各机关、学校、部队等负责人及干部和学员七千余人。会议由中共察哈尔省委主持。她的报告共分三部分：（一）婚姻法是怎样产生的；（二）婚姻法的主要内容；（三）如何贯彻实行婚姻法。报告摘要如下：
    （一）婚姻法是怎样产生的
    中华人民共和国婚姻法的制定公布和命令施行，是中国劳动人民长期奋斗和人民大革命及人民解放战争胜利果实之一；是在驱逐了帝国主义，推翻了反动统治，在一部分地区实行了土地改革，建立了全国性的人民民主专政的新的政治、经济基础上的产物；是广大觉悟了的劳动人民，特别是广大劳动妇女要求的集中表现。经过了十七个月的时间，由主管及有关机关依据着废除封建婚姻制度，实行婚姻自由，男女权利平等，保护妇女儿童利益的基本原则；又根据所搜集的城乡各项婚姻材料，参考了各解放区的婚姻法以及苏联和新民主主义国家的婚姻法，征求了各民主党派、各人民团体、各司法机关的意见，举行了多种多次座谈，反复研究讨论才制定的。并经中央人民政府委员会第七次会议通过公布，又经毛泽东主席发布命令，自一九五○年五月一日起施行。中共中央通知全党保证执行，指出中共党员应一致拥护与遵守。这部婚姻法，既完全否定了封建婚姻制度，亦根本区别于资本主义社会的所谓“自由平等”的婚姻法，区别于国民党反动统治下的婚姻法；但也不尽同于社会主义苏联今天的婚姻法。中华人民共和国的婚姻法，是合乎中国国情，切合时宜和需要的一部新民主主义社会的婚姻法。它代表了中国城市和乡村的广大已婚、未婚的男女人民，特别是妇女的切身利益，同时照顾了革命军人和各民族情况以及下一代的幸福。既具有对封建制度的彻底破坏性，又具有对新民主主义婚姻制度的积极建设性。这部婚姻法公布以后，在几千年来封建婚姻制度压迫下，受深重痛苦的全体男女劳动人民，特别是受痛苦和牺牲最重的妇女们，在婚姻方面将获得解放和自由。但是有一些人不从婚姻法的全部内容联系来看，而是片面的孤立的甚至断章取义的看问题，因而发生了许多不正确的认识，所以更必须进行广泛而深入的宣传和解释。
    （二）婚姻法的主要内容
    制定婚姻法的原则，在第一章中即明确规定了第一条废除包办强迫，男尊女卑，漠视子女利益的封建主义的婚姻制度。实行男女婚姻自由，一夫一妻，男女权利平等，保护妇女和子女合法利益的新民主主义婚姻制度。第二条禁止重婚，纳妾，禁止童养媳，禁止干涉寡妇婚姻自由。禁止任何人借婚姻关系索取财物。这两条原则的精神，贯串在整个婚姻法中。实行婚姻自由，是包括结婚自由和离婚自由两个方面的。既保证男女双方有结婚和离婚的自由（见婚姻法的第二章第三条及第五章第十七条），但又使男女双方结婚离婚要采取慎重态度（见第二章四、五、六条及第五章第十七条中的离婚规定），反对儿戏草率。在婚姻案件的调解和判决工作上，要采取严肃慎重，调查研究，合情合理，解决问题的负责态度。
    为什么在第十七条中规定男女一方坚决要求离婚，经调解无效即准予离婚？这一条是根据农村及城市妇女特别是实行土地改革以后广大劳动妇女的要求而制定的。根据北京、天津、上海、西安、哈尔滨等八个城市中的统计，婚姻案件在民事案件中即占百分之十一点九至百分之四八点九。在山西、河北、察哈尔等地农村中的民事中，婚姻案件占百分之三十三点三至百分之九十九。婚姻案件中离婚与解除婚约的，在上述城市中占百分之五十一至百分之八十四，农村中占百分之五十四。离婚原因主要是包办、压迫、买卖、虐待、早婚、重婚、通奸、遗弃等，共占百分之七十八至百分之八十二。提出离婚的主要是女方，占百分之六十八至百分之九十二。而这些案件的当事人，又绝大多数是青、壮年劳动人民。因此，从上述材料中证明，第十七条的规定对广大妇女是有利的，并且要经过调解判决等法律程序，来保障正确地实现这种自由。
    第十七条的规定，是否会引起草率离婚和社会混乱？从整个婚姻法所规定的各章中的原则精神及内容看来，只要正确地执行它，不但能使男女人民及其子女生活走向幸福，而且正是消灭旧社会中男女关系混乱的有效办法。现在存在的某些婚姻混乱现象，约有下面几个原因：（一）封建婚姻制度的存在，婚姻不自由，特别是离婚不自由，这是最基本，最主要的；（二）打破旧的婚姻制度的革命行动所带来的某些副作用，如由于误解婚姻自由为随便结婚，于是男女性关系就随便乱来；（三）长期战争的原因；（四）在执行婚姻自由政策中“左”或“右”的偏向所造成的。因此，只有全部正确实施婚姻法，并从教育及培养新社会道德着手，才能消灭在过渡时期男女婚姻方面各形各式的混乱现象。
    婚姻法的第三、四章中一共十条，确定夫妻间的权利和义务及父母子女间的关系，这是为的巩固夫妻关系，建立幸福、愉快、美好的家庭。婚后生活和婚前生活是有基本性质区别的。一般人对婚后生活都重视不够，有些人仅仅重视婚前的恋爱生活，而漠视婚后如何建立夫妻间良好关系和融洽生活，因而发生摩擦、纠纷、冲突，以至发展成为离婚因素。其实婚后生活比婚前生活更复杂，其影响及于夫妻、子女、家庭、同志、朋友、事业和社会各方面，而且随着婚后生活的持续而日益发展复杂起来，因此，在婚后的男女双方要善于处理。
    着重保护妇女和子女的合法权益，同时又照顾了各方面。这一原则的精神，在婚姻法中明显地表现出来。如夫妻、父母、子女、结婚、离婚后双方的关系、财产处理等。为什么要着重保护妇女和子女的合法权益，这正是男女平等的原则与中国实际结合的具体实践，也是共同纲领在婚姻法上的具体化，对于男女人民和社会都是有利的。因为妇女解放是社会解放的尺度，儿童幸福是社会进步的表现。
    （三）如何贯彻实行婚姻法
    婚姻法本身的制定，曾经过了与各种思想斗争的过程；而使其贯彻执行，更需要经过长期的多方面的斗争过程。因为一个法令或决议的制定，公布，仅仅是问题得到解决的开始，并不等于已全部解决与实现了。婚姻法要确实贯彻下去，一方面在广大男女人民中长期不断地提倡新的风气，培养有利于婚姻自由的社会环境；另一方面，则在于干部对于婚姻法能否正确地认识，善于掌握和坚决执行，这是首要和决定的关键。因此，首先应在干部中进行肃清封建残余思想的工作，克服在干部中存在的某些包办，强迫别人婚姻的现象（如干涉别人结婚、离婚或统制本村妇女不能与外村人结婚等）；并要认真研究婚姻法，必须认识婚姻法及我们对于婚姻的政策，是关系千百万群众利益的大问题，而把保证婚姻法的正确执行，当作目前和经常的重要工作任务之一。为此，党、政、军、民及各级有关机关，要具体的组织传达学习，在群众中进行深入宣传，长期教育，促进与依靠群众的觉悟来解决群众自己的问题；切忌从主观愿望、恩赐观点出发，和防止发生强迫命令的现象。要提倡男女社交自由，未婚男女恋爱自由，对于男女间的来往与恋爱只要不妨碍学习和工作，就不要引为大惊小怪或加以干涉。只有这样才能给实行婚姻自由准备下良好的社会环境，在交朋友和讲恋爱的男女，要在共同工作或学习中互相了解，建立友谊和爱情，进而为共同事业奋斗。如单纯从性爱或因其他物质条件或小资产阶级的恋爱至上出发，都是不正确的。妇女解放必须依靠妇女自己的奋斗，首先从努力参加各种建设事业中提高自己各方面的地位，才能打碎封建婚姻的枷锁。婚姻法的正确执行，将会引起良好的影响，正如中共中央通知上所说：“正确地实行婚姻法，不仅将使中国男女群众——尤其是妇女群众，从几千年野蛮落后的旧婚姻制度下解放出来，而且可以建立新的婚姻制度、新的家庭关系、新的社会生活和新的社会道德，以促进新民主主义中国的政治建设、经济建设、文化建设和国防建设的发展。”
