　　District Cadres Steal Disaster Relief Clothing
    Readers Propose Handling Suggestions

    To the Editors:
    Having read the article published in the People's Garden on May 16th regarding the theft of disaster relief clothing by cadres in the Fourth District of Yutian, we are extremely indignant. We all know the hardship of life for the people in disaster areas. The Central People's Government has called on the people of the whole country to make disaster relief work one of the four major tasks of 1950. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese People's Liberation Army have unanimously called on the entire Party and the entire army to economize on food and clothing and vigorously carry out disaster relief. People in various places, Party and government organs, and troops have all responded to the call of the Central People's Government and the Communist Party of China by donating clothing, money, and grain to help disaster victims. However, the cadres in the Fourth District of Yutian not only failed to actively lead the disaster-stricken people in their district to find ways to overcome the famine, but instead stole disaster relief clothing to enrich themselves. This selfish and greedy behavior that infringes on the interests of the masses should be severely punished. We hope that Zheng Yunfang, the secretary of the district office who took the lead in stealing the clothing, as well as the work team leader Ma Boyi, the deputy district head Yu Deqian, and the other nine people involved, will be handed over to the People's Court for investigation and prosecution, and that they will be required to make a public self-criticism to the people in the Party newspaper.

　　区干部窃取救灾衣服
    读者提出处理意见编辑同志：
    看到五月十六日人民园地刊载玉田四区干部窃取救灾衣服的事情，我们异常愤恨。灾区人民生活的困苦是大家所知道的。中央人民政府向全国人民提出号召，把救灾工作作为一九五○年四大任务之一。中国共产党、中国人民解放军一致号召全党全军节衣缩食，大力救灾。各地人民、各党政机关和部队也都响应了中央人民政府及中国共产党的号召，捐衣、捐款、捐米来救济灾民。而玉田四区干部不但不积极领导本区灾民设法渡过灾荒，反而窃取救灾衣服以自肥。这种自私自利侵犯群众利益的贪污行为，应该受到严厉制裁。我们希望把带头窃取衣服的区公所秘书郑云芳及工作队长马柏义，副区长于德谦等九人，送人民法院查办，并要他们在党报上公开向人民作检讨。
