Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 13th. The Texaco Oil Company of America in Nanjing illegally concealed seven B斗山 (Ba Dou Shan) oil tanks belonging to the Kuomintang reactionary government. The Nanjing Military Control Commission investigated and ordered them to hand over all the tanks on the 3rd of this month. The inventory procedures are currently underway. Ba Dou Shan is located near Yanzi矶 (Yanzi Ji) in the suburbs of Nanjing and has seven oil tanks built by the Japanese invaders. After the surrender of the Japanese invaders, the Kuomintang reactionary government took over the tanks and handed them over to Texaco Oil Company of America in Nanjing in 1947 to be temporarily responsible for their safekeeping. After the liberation of Nanjing, the Nanjing Military Control Commission issued a proclamation in September 1949, ordering all companies, factories, firms and shops in Nanjing and the Ninghu area to report to the Military Control Commission any goods made or handled for enemy or puppet authorities or troops before liberation that had not yet been delivered or fully delivered, so that they could be cleared. However, Texaco Company dared to disregard the laws and regulations of our Military Control Authority and failed to truthfully report the tanks. The Nanjing Military Control Commission issued a notice to the company on May 3, pointing out the company's illegal act of intentionally concealing enemy and puppet property, ordering it to hand over all the Ba Dou Shan oil tanks and their mechanical equipment in its custody, and immediately appoint a special person to work with the Enemy and Puppet Materials Clearing Office of the Military Control Commission to carry out the handover procedures, and must not disobey or engage in any destruction, sale, theft, or other acts. At this point, Texaco Company of America realized that it could not deny the facts, so it began to carry out the handover procedures on the 7th of this month.

　　南京市军管会
　　令美商德士古公司
　　呈交所隐匿的敌产
    【新华社南京十三日电】在南京的美商德士古煤油公司，非法隐匿国民党反动政府的财产笆斗山油池七座，经南京市军事管制委员会查获并于本月三日令其悉数呈交，现正办理清点手续中。笆斗山位于南京市近郊燕子矶附近，计有油池七座，为日寇所建。日寇投降后，由国民党反动政府接收，于一九四七年交由美商南京德士古煤油公司暂行负责保管。南京解放后，南京市军管会曾于一九四九年九月发出布告，通令宁市及宁沪一带各公司厂商行号，在解放前承制或代办敌伪机关部队之各种货品，尚未交货或未交清者，应即向军管会报告，以便清理。但德士古公司竟敢玩忽我军管当局法令，迄未据实呈报。南京市军管会乃于五月三日对该公司发出通知书一件，除指出该公司有意隐匿敌伪财产之非法行为外，令其将保管之全部笆斗山油池及其机件设备悉数呈交，并应立即指定专人会同军管会敌伪物资清理处办理点交手续，不得违抗与发生任何破坏、变卖、盗窃等事。至此，美商德士古公司已觉无可抵赖，乃于本月七日起开始办理点交手续。
