　　Cadres in Wu Yi's Fifth District Infringe on Human Rights; County Government Imposes Legal Penalties

　　The Fifth District government of Wu Yi County, Hebei Province, established its own detention center. Not only did it fail to promptly process prisoners, but it also condoned the militia extorting grain from prisoners, leading to successive incidents of prisoners hanging themselves.

　　Because of the cramped quarters in the Fifth District government, prisoners were handed over to the Li Lüchi village militia headquarters for detention. The Li Lüchi village had 47 militiamen, with Li Zhenhai, who had been struggled against for corruption, and Li Xinhe, who had been struggled against for serving as a puppet village chief and maintenance association chairman, in control. From January to December 1949, the Fifth District detained a total of 79 prisoners. The militia headquarters demanded over 3,000 *jin* of grain from the prisoners (only 1,100 *jin* of which was for the prisoners' food). Of the 47 militiamen in Li Lüchi village, 36 each received 11 *jin* of millet, 5 *jin* of corn, and 14 *jin* of red beans, totaling 1,080 *jin* of grain, plus 24,950 yuan in People's Currency. The remaining assets were also wasted. Last year, during the lunar August festival, the militiamen spent 605 *jin* of millet on a feast.

　　In early December of last year, twelve gambling offenders from Feng Bazhen village were detained for four days and paid 480 *jin* of grain. Li Shitou, a thief from Li Lüchi village, was detained and, after eating one meal, paid 70 *jin* of soybeans. In December, Liu Huan (female) and three others, suspected of theft from Yang Lüchi village, were detained for 14 days, but their cases were not processed. Liu Huan, because of her poverty-stricken family, had nothing to eat, and the militiamen were demanding grain, so she hanged herself on December 28th. On December 25th, Yang Jiuchang of Yang Liuguan village was tied up and beaten by the village militia captain Yang Changzhan for stealing yams and then sent to the district government for detention. Because Li Zhenhai and Li Xinhe knew that his family was poor and feared that he would not be able to hand over the grain after being released, they sent militiamen Li Haicang and Li Sanmo to his home to get the grain before he was even released. Yang Jiuchang's family only had 60 *jin* of grain, and they wanted to take it all. Only after his family and neighbors pleaded did they leave 20 *jin*. After Yang Jiuchang and the militiamen returned from getting the grain at his home, he hanged himself on the evening of December 31st. After his death, Li Zhenhai said, "It doesn't matter if he dies. Carry one out, carry two out."

　　The Wu Yi County government sent Wang Zhenshan, chief of the public security section of the Public Security Bureau, and Zhu Linhua of the People's Court to examine the body the day after Liu Huan died. Then, after Yang Jiuchang's death, it caught the attention of the CCP County Committee, which sent three people, including Zhi Guanzhou, secretary of the Armed Forces Department, to conduct an in-depth investigation, only to discover the lawless behavior of Li Zhenhai, the militia captain of Li Lüchi village, and Li Xinhe, the squad leader. The county government has now arrested and detained Li Zhenhai and Li Xinhe, as well as Yang Changzhan, the militia captain of Yang Liuguan village who beat Yang Jiuchang, and the County People's Court will sentence them to prison according to law. Wang Zhenqing, the district chief of the Fifth District, established a detention center in the district during his tenure and condoned the militia extorting grain from prisoners, resulting in successive incidents of prisoners hanging themselves. After the county government reported to the special commissioner's office, it was decided to remove him from his post and sentence him to three months in prison, suspended for half a year. Other personnel involved in the case have also been given appropriate punishments.

　　Editor's note: The serious incident reflected in the letter above occurred last December, and the county government only dealt with it now, which shows that the county government has serious bureaucracy and should conduct a profound self-criticism.

　　武邑五区干部侵害人权  县府分别给予法律处分
    河北武邑县五区政府自立看守所，对犯人不仅不及时处理，并纵容民兵勒索犯人粮食，连续造成犯人自缢事件。
    五区政府因房屋狭窄，每次把抓来的犯人交给李吕池村民兵队部扣押。李吕池村共四十七个民兵，由曾经因贪污被斗争过的李振海和曾经做过伪村长、维持会长而被斗争过的李新合掌握大权。一九四九年一月至十二月五区共扣押犯人七十九人，民兵队部向犯人所要的粮食共三千余斤（其中只有一千一百斤是犯人所应交的伙食）。李吕池村四十七个民兵中的三十六个民兵每人分了小米十一斤、玉米五斤、红豆十四斤，共分了粮食一千零八十斤，人民币两万四千九百五十元，其余的财物也全浪费了。去年过阴历八月节时，全体民兵吃了一顿酒席就花了小米六百零五斤。
    去年十二月上旬，该区冯八阵村赌犯十二人被扣四天，交粮四百八十斤。李吕池村小偷犯李石头被扣，结果吃了一顿饭，交了吉豆七十斤。十二月杨吕池村偷盗嫌疑犯刘换（女）等四人被扣十四天，案件得不到处理。刘换因家境贫苦，目下没吃的，而民兵又要索取粮食，便于十二月廿八日自缢身死。十二月廿五日杨刘贯村杨久长为偷山药事被本村民兵队长杨长站令民兵捆缚吊打一顿，后又送区政府扣押。因李振海，李新合知道他家景贫穷，怕释放后交不了粮；于是未等到释放即派民兵李海仓、李三膜带着久长到家拿粮。杨久长家中只有六十斤谷子，要全部拿走，后经他家及邻居们要求，给剩下二十斤。杨久长和民兵到家中拿粮回来以后，即于十二月三十一日晚自缢身死。死后李振海说：“死了没关系，死一个挟出去，死两个担出去。”
    武邑县政府在刘换死后第二天，即派公安局治安股股长王振山、人民法院祝林华去验尸。接着杨久长死后，引起中共县委注意，即派武装部秘书支官周等三人前往深入调查，才发觉李吕池村民兵队长李振海，班长李新合目无法纪的行为。现县政府已将李振海、李新合二人和杨刘贯村吊打杨久长的民兵队长杨长站逮捕扣押县人民法院，依法分别判处徒刑。五区区长王振清，在任职期间在区上自立看守所，并纵容民兵勒索犯人粮食，致连续造成犯人自缢事件，经县府呈报专署决定将其撤职，并处以有期徒刑三个月，缓刑半年。与此案有关之其他人员，亦同时加以适当处分。

    编者按：上面这封信所反映的严重事件发生于去年十二月，而县政府直到现在才处理，说明县政府存在着严重的官僚主义，应作深刻的检讨。
