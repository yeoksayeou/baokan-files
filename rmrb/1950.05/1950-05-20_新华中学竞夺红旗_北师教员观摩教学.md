　　Xinhua Middle School Competes for the Red Flag
　　Beijing Normal University Faculty Observe Teaching
　　To commemorate the first Red May after the founding of the country and to improve regular coursework, Xinhua Middle School specially created a "May Red Flag" banner. They proposed that any class that could meet the following conditions could obtain the flag: 1. The whole class studies diligently; 2. No noise in class, and no reading of extracurricular books during class; 3. Diligent in production; 4. Pay attention to hygiene. Students in each class responded enthusiastically, and their enthusiasm for learning was higher than before. (Xinhua Communications Group)
　　The Mongolian wall newspaper "Learning Ten-Day Journal," organized by two Mongolian teachers from the National Mongolian Tibetan School, was launched on the 11th. The content includes Mongolian compositions by students, articles exchanging experiences in learning Mongolian, and Mongolian-Chinese "Conversation Lectures," etc. One student wrote: "We must learn Mongolian well and prepare to build our new Inner Mongolia." (Communications Department)
　　In order to improve the professional level of teachers, the primary schools in the 15th District held a meeting of central principals on May 4th and established a demonstration teaching committee. Observation teaching was organized in five central school districts, based on the central school district. Senior grades focused on history; lower-grade composite classes focused on Chinese. (Yan Qing)
　　The Beijing Normal University Dean's Office launched "Teaching Transformation" work in April, mobilizing teachers of the same or similar subjects to exchange classes for observation. Each week, each subject takes turns to do "model teaching," mutually observing and absorbing the advantages of others in teaching. During group study, they mutually criticize the content, viewpoints, and methods of teaching, and exchange teaching experiences to improve teaching effectiveness.

　　The workers of Hebei Provincial Beijing Normal School are very active in learning. Recently, they published their own "Workers' Wall Newspaper." The size is three newspaper pages, and the writing is neat. The after-school production "Doggerel" written by clock-ringing worker Li Fujun is most loved by the students.

　　新华中学竞夺红旗
　  北师教员观摩教学
    新华中学为纪念开国后第一个红五月及学好正课，校方特制了锦标“五月红旗一面，提出如能达到以下条件者即可得旗：一、全班学习紧张，二、上课不喧哗，上课时不看课外书籍，三、生产努力，四、讲求卫生。各班同学纷纷响应，学习情绪比往日更高。（新华通讯小组）
    国立蒙藏学校两位蒙文教员筹办的蒙文墙报“学习旬刊”，已于十一日创刊。内容有同学们的蒙文作文，交流学习蒙文经验的文章，及蒙汉文对照的“会话讲座”等。一位同学写道：“我们一定要学好蒙文，准备回去建设自己的新内蒙。”（通联部）
    十五区各小学为提高教师业务水平，五月四日全区中心校长会议上，成立了示范教学委员会。以中心学区为单位，在五个中心学区组织观摩教学。高年级以历史科为主；低年级复式班以国语科为主。（燕青）
    北师教导处于四月份展开“改造教学”工作，发动同科或性质相近的教员交换听课。每星期各科轮流作“模范教学”，互相观摩和吸取别人在教学上的优点。小组学习时，互相批评教学的内容、观点、方法，交换教学经验，以提高教学效果。

    河北省立北京师范工友们学习很积极，最近自己出版了“工友壁报”。篇幅有三张报纸大，抄写得也整齐。打钟工友李福钧写的课余生产“顺口溜”，最为同学所爱读。
