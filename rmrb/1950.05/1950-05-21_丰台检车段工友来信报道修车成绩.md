　　Fengtai Inspection Depot Workers' Letter Reports Car Repair Achievements

Comrade Editor:
    Since the start of the production competition at the Fengtai Inspection Depot, the workers have been working intensely. Take May 12th as an example. The repair tracks in each section of the inspection depot were filled with as many as thirty-eight vehicles waiting to be repaired or being repaired. The workers in the repair shop were all filled with confidence in completing their tasks. Everyone happily said, "Ha! Ha! What do these tasks amount to? We must complete them." You see, every worker was working hard, covered in sweat. The cadres were also busy. The Shang Guangtai group, originally planning to work on heavily damaged cars on three tracks, upon seeing that Group A had few people and many cars, mobilized the entire team to focus on the Group A cars, completing one Group A car that day. The Wang Yanzhong group was repairing Group A cars sent from the south, which were of very low quality and generally could not be repaired in a single day. However, with the vigorous efforts of the entire group, they were completed on the same day. The female workers in the oil line room, during the competition, ensured the daily supply of new oil rolls for four Group A cars (this task previously required four people, but today, only three female workers completed the task). Group C not only completed the Group C cars scheduled for the day but also rushed to repair three repair cars awaiting wheel and scraper tile replacements from the previous day. In total, four Group A cars, three Group B cars, twenty-one Group C cars, and twelve repair cars were completed that day, totaling forty vehicles. Calculated by converting to Group C cars, this equals 80.7 vehicles, creating an unprecedented new record for the Fengtai Inspection Depot.

　　丰台检车段工友来信报道修车成绩编辑同志：
    丰台检车段生产竞赛运动开始以后，工友们即紧张地工作起来。就拿五月十二日来说吧，在检车段各股修车道上，挤满了等待修理及正在修理中的车辆，达三十八辆之多。修车所的工友们，个个满怀着信心地要把任务完成。大家高兴地说：“哈！哈！这么些任务算什么，怎么也要完成。”你看，每个工友都满头大汗地紧张工作着。干部们也都忙着。大修尚广泰组，原拟做三股道的大破损车，但一见到甲检组人少车多，就动员全班人马来突击甲检车，当天就完成了一辆甲检。王彦忠组修的是南方送来的甲检车，质量非常低，一般说当天是不能修好的。但是在全组工友的大力突击下，竟在当天完工了。油线房的女工友们，在竞赛中每日保证供应四辆甲检车所用的新油卷（这项工作，以往是需要四个人做的，但是在今天仅以三位女工友的力量就完成了任务）。丙检组不但完成当日丙检车，并把昨日等待换轮刮瓦的三辆修理车赶修出线。总起来说，这天完成了甲检车四辆、乙检三辆、丙检二十一辆、修理十二辆，共计四十辆。如按丙检车折合计算，共为八十·七辆，创造了丰台检车段空前未有的新纪录。
