    The work bugle sounded. Each squad and platoon scrambled to enter their positions. Everyone took off their cotton jackets, some even their cotton trousers. Even so, swinging the picks still made them sweat!

    The Seventh Squad was a model squad in training, excelling in shooting throughout the battalion. This time, in land reclamation, everyone was confident of victory. Squad Leader Chen Dahai managed things this way: at the beginning, he didn't let everyone go all out, even if they reclaimed a little less, because everyone hadn't done this kind of work for years. If they worked too hard, they'd get blisters on their hands or get sick, and it would be difficult later on. He urged everyone, saying, "Don't think you can build a golden palace with one shovel. Working requires patience, the ability to 'persist regularly.' If you rush through a storm, I guarantee you'll collapse in less than two days." Everyone agreed that what the squad leader said made sense. After digging for two days, no one in the squad got blisters on their hands. Today, the squad was divided for work, and without the squad leader saying anything, everyone automatically revved up. Based on his old experience of marching, Chen Squad Leader knew that working with your head down could easily lead to fatigue. Talking and chatting could adjust your spirit, and a good spirit would bring energy. So, he started the conversation first: "Hey! Our rows of land reclamation look like 'tractors'!" Wang Shun, the study group leader, heard him and chimed in, "Hey! We've seen tractors! When I went to the division to participate in the worker-student representative meeting, I saw one at Huiwen Middle School!" Little Liu, who was eighteen years old, asked with great interest, "Is the 'tractor' you're talking about the iron ox that the comrades upstairs were talking about? I wonder when we'll be able to use one!" Chen Squad Leader then gave a set of reasons for intensifying production, developing the economy, and industrializing the country. Liberation fighter San Xiao said, "It'll be great in a socialist society. The army will be fully motorized, with all kinds of automatic guns..." Little Liu interjected, "That'll be great. A regiment will live in a big building, and two guards will be enough for the front and back doors. We'll only have to rotate shifts every two months!" Everyone burst out laughing! "You kid, you're just thinking about good things!" Amid the laughter, the picks flew.

    The Second Squad was a bit off today. Xiao Erhei put down his heavy pickaxe and pulled a towel from behind his waist to wipe the sweat from his head. Someone joked from behind, "Looks like a big steamed bun is out of the pot!" He turned around and teased back, "Great harvest! Four cannons captured in two days!" With that, he raised his hand to show everyone the four purple blisters. The deputy squad leader took one look and said, "You're not using the pickaxe correctly." Xiao Erhei glared: "You're digging too fast, so I'm trying to keep up with you!" San Hu also put down his pick and said, "How can we keep up with the deputy squad leader? He's been working for fourteen years!" The squad leader joined in, "It doesn't matter if some comrades in our squad got blisters. We'll take it easy this year, and we can catch up with the other squads later."

    Just then, the regimental chief of staff arrived. The chief of staff picked up Xiao Erhei's pick and started digging hard. San Hu muttered, "I bet the chief of staff can't dig more than twenty times before he's exhausted." The chief of staff took out his watch and smiled, "Persist for ten minutes!" With that, he also threw off his cotton jacket and continued digging. Xiao Erhei shouted, "The chief of staff is competing with us! We'll put him in the newspaper tomorrow!" San Hu really started competing with the chief of staff, taking off his shoes and throwing away his hat, like a little tiger keeping pace with the chief of staff. Erhei, wrapping his hand with cloth over the blisters, said inadvertently, "When it comes to reclaiming land, the chief of staff is not as good as us." The deputy squad leader retorted, "We can't handle whatever problems the chief of staff figures out!" This caused another burst of laughter.

    The bugle sounded, announcing a break. Everyone put down their tools. The gongs and drums sounded, and the loudspeaker also broadcast. At the edge of the field, the "little bookstore" shouted loudly, "New Comrades, New Forward Report, Three Character Classic, literacy textbooks, free to read! Come quickly!" The wall newspaper group leader also shouted, "Who's a hero, who's a good man, look at the wall newspaper here!" He had just returned from art training in the division, and there were several of his drawings on it. The entertainment group also opened the venue. There were many people surrounding the small circle, drinking boiled water and smoking dry tobacco. The program began. The third platoon leader ran up to sing his Henan Clapper Opera that everyone had heard more than three times. Everyone shouted, "Not welcome!" But he still had to sing a segment of the new Henan Clapper Opera "Wang Renhou." Next, the ninth squad leader was pulled up to perform opening a train. This time, the performance had new tricks, not only learning the sound but also adding water, passenger conversations, and the human characteristics of each station, winning everyone's warm applause. Then Xiao Erhei ran up and said, "I composed a 'soldiers singing about soldiers', but I don't know how to compose a new tune, so let's just use an old tune. If there's anything wrong with it, please criticize it after the singing." Everyone grumbled, "Don't come with the preambles, sing quickly!" "Laxiola duo mi... listen to me sing about Wang Wenqing of the third squad..." After the singing, everyone said, "Not bad!" "Erhei has some skills." Then several other comrades went up to make "fools of themselves." Finally, comrades from the propaganda team gave a segment of "Nanniwan" with both speaking and singing. Everyone said the song was very good, but there were too many turns in it, and they couldn't get the tune right if they wanted to learn it.

    When work started again, each squad and platoon became tense. The second platoon was about to finish reclaiming their assigned land, while the first platoon was still short of two mu of land. Everyone shouted slogans to each other: "Don't lose heart!" "Keep up the good work!" The literacy signs in front of each squad also read: "Don't lose heart."

    The second platoon reached the end. The instructor dug the last pick and said, "Our second platoon's small battle is over. Comrades, don't stop! We must carry forward the spirit of 'internationalism' and help the first platoon!" Everyone said in unison: "Yes!" The second platoon leader shouted, "Comrades of the first platoon, let's attack from both sides and wipe out the Chiang bandits!" The other side also shouted, "Liberate Taiwan, liberate all of China!" The picks rang out. Before long, the wasteland of the first platoon was also reclaimed.

    The quitting time arrived. Everyone packed up their tools and bundled the firewood they had cut down, which was more than a thousand pounds! They carried it on their shoulders and backs and went home. The measurement team reported to the company commander: "Today, a total of forty-five mu of wasteland was reclaimed, an increase of fifteen mu compared to yesterday and an increase of twenty mu compared to the day before yesterday..."

　　“咱们好像拖拉机！”
　　人民解放军某部队开荒速写
　　矢中
    工作号吹起了。各班、排争抢着进入阵地。谁都脱下了棉上衣，有的竟将棉裤也脱了。就这样，抡起镐来还热的不行呢！
    七班在练兵中是模范班，射击在全营占优胜。这次开荒中大家也有信心争取胜利。班长陈大海是这样掌握的：开头不让大家卖死劲干，少开点也不打紧，因为大家都有年月没干过这活儿了，如干的太猛，手一打泡或发生了病号，往后就不好办了。他动员大家说：“不要想一锹就修起个金銮殿来，干活儿要有耐性，能‘坚持经常’；要是风风雨雨的突击一阵，管保你下不去两天就垮下来。”大家都认为班长说的对劲儿。刨了两天，全班谁的手上也没打泡。今天分了班干，没等班长说大家都自动加起油来。陈班长根据过去行军的老经验，闷着头干容易感到疲劳，如说话搭啦的干就能调剂精神，精神一好就来劲儿。于是他首先拉开了话匣子：“噫！咱们这一排排的开地好像‘拖拉机’呢！”学习组长王顺一听张嘴啦：“嘿！拖拉机咱还见过呢！到师里参加工学代表会时，看汇文中学就有一架么！”十八岁的小刘很有兴味的问：“你们说的‘拖拉机’就是战友上说的铁牛吧？咱们不知啥时候才能用呢！”陈班长就随着来了一套加紧生产，发展经济，国家工业化的道理。解放战士三小说：“到社会主义社会就美了，军队全是摩托化，一崭的自动枪……”小刘抢着说：“那可好，一个团住个大楼，前门后门放两个岗就够了。要两个月才轮一次班呢！”大家哄然笑起来！“你小子净想好事！”在嘻笑中，镐头翻飞着。
    二班今天可有点差劲了。小二黑把大镐一放，由腰后抽下手巾抹擦了一把头上的汗。不知谁在后面开玩笑说：“看大馒头揭锅了！”他也回头取笑着说：“收获不小呢！两天缴获四门大炮！”说罢举起手来叫大家看看四个发紫的水泡。副班长一看说：“你拿镐不得要领。”小二黑眼珠一瞪：“你开的太快，我也就跟你赶呗！”三虎也歇下镐说：“咱们能赶的上副班长？人家扛过十四年活呢！”班长搭话了：“咱班有几个同志打了泡也没关系，今年歇着点干，往后一样能赶上别的班。”
    正说着，团参谋长来了。参谋长拿起小二黑的镐猛猛地刨起地来了。三虎一边念道：“我猜参谋长刨不过二十下子就得累扒了。”参谋长掏出表一看笑了笑：“坚持十分钟！”说完也把上身棉衣一甩，接着刨了起来。小二黑嚷着：“参谋长跟咱们竞赛啦，明天给他登报哇！”三虎却真的跟参谋长赛起来，鞋子一脱、帽子一扔，小老虎似的跟参谋长并摆着干。二黑用布裹着手上的泡不经意的说：“要说开地参谋长可不如我们。”副班长反驳他：“参谋个啥问题咱们可不行呢！”又引起一阵哄笑。
    号音响了，宣布休息，大家放下工具，锣鼓响起来，扬声筒也播音了，地头上“小书店”高声叫着：“新战友、新前进报、三字经、识字课本，不要钱白看！快来呀！”墙报组长也喊着：“谁英雄，谁好汉，这边墙报上看！”他刚由师里受美术训回来，上面有他画的好几张画呢；娱乐小组也打开场子了，小圈圈人围的不少，喝着开水抽着旱烟，节目开始了。三排长跑上去要唱他那谁都听过了三遍以上的落子。大家都嚷着：“不欢迎！”可还是得由他唱了段新梆子“王仁厚”。接着被拉上去的是九班长，欢迎他表演开火车。这一回表演的又有新花样了，不光学声音，还加上了上水、乘客谈话、各站的人情特色等，博得大家热烈的掌声。接着小二黑跑上来说：“我编了个‘兵唱兵’咱也不会编新调，就借个老调子使吧，那儿有毛病，唱完大家批评。”大家咕嚷着：“别来外叙了，快唱吧！”“腊嗦腊多密……听我唱唱三班的王文清……”唱完大家都说：“不赖！”“二黑有两下子。”接着又有几个同志上去出“洋相”，最后由宣传队同志连讲带唱的来了段“南泥湾”。大家都说歌很好，就是里面拐弯太多，想学拿不好调子。
    工作再开始时，每班每排都紧张起来，二排眼看就把分的地开完了，一排还差着二亩来地呢。大家互相喊着口号：“别泄劲哪！”“加油干哪！”各班前面的识字牌也都写上了：“别泄劲”。
    二排开到头了，指导员刨了最后一镐说：“咱们二排小战斗结束了，同志们别住手哇！要发扬‘国际主义’精神，帮助一排去！”大家齐声说：“对！”二排长喊着说：“一排同志们，咱们两面夹击，歼灭蒋匪！”对方也呼喊着：“解放台湾，解放全中国！”镐头刷刷地响起来，不多会儿，一排的荒地也开完了。
    收工的钟点到了，大家收拾着工具，捆着打下的柴草，能有一千多斤呢！担着背着的回家了。测量组向连长报告说：“今天共开荒四十五亩，比昨天增加了十五亩，比前天增加了二十亩……”
