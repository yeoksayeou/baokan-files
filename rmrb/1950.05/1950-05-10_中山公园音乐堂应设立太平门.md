To the Editor:

On April 29th, I attended the cadre meeting held in the Zhongshan Park Music Hall to celebrate the May 1st Labor Day, and listened to Vice Chairman Liu Shaoqi's speech. The number of people attending that day was approximately 4,500. The music hall only has one exit, and there are two wooden gates at the entrance. After the meeting adjourned, more than 4,500 people left the venue through a single exit, which caused extreme congestion. Therefore, I suggest that the Zhongshan Park Music Hall should immediately build two to four emergency exits on both sides, and the current wooden gates at the exit should be rebuilt to be movable.

### 中山公园音乐堂应设立太平门

　　中山公园音乐堂应设立太平门编辑同志：
    四月二十九日我出席了在中山公园音乐堂举行的庆祝五一劳动节干部大会，听刘少奇副主席的演说。那天参加的人数约在四千五百人左右。音乐堂只有一个出口，门口并有两个木栅。在散会以后，四千五百余人从一个出口离开会场，因此便发生极端拥挤的现象。所以我建议中山公园音乐堂应马上在两旁建立两个至四个太平门，并且将目前出口之木栅改建为活动的。 刘良模
