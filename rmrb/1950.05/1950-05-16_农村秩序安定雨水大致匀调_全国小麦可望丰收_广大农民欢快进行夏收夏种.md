Xinhua News Agency, 14th: According to news from the Agricultural Administration Department of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government: In March, April, and the first ten days of May this year, most areas of the country have successively experienced thorough rains. Since the beginning of spring, except for some areas in Heilongjiang, Guizhou, the Xing'an League and Hulunbuir League in Inner Mongolia that have lacked rain, other areas have successively experienced thorough rains. If there are no new disasters, a bumper wheat harvest is already guaranteed, and spring plowing and planting can also be completed smoothly; moreover, in many areas that had experienced insect pests, the pest situation has been greatly reduced after the rainfall.

In all the areas where rain has fallen, the masses of farmers are joyfully carrying out spring plowing and planting, especially in cotton-growing areas such as Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong, where cotton planting campaigns have been widely launched. However, there are also a small number of areas, such as the Huaiyin Special District in northern Jiangsu, the Su County Special District in northern Anhui, Cang County in Shandong, the Tianjin Special District in Hebei, Heze and Shouzhang in Pingyuan Province, and Xinmin, Kaiyuan, and Tieling in western Liaoning, that have suffered disasters due to excessive rainfall and breached river embankments. The people's governments in the aforementioned areas are now leading farmers to drain water and save wheat, and are fighting against new floods. In areas lacking rain or experiencing severe drought, local people's governments are also leading the planting of early-maturing crops and carrying out drought-resistant planting.

[This newspaper reports] The first wheat harvest season since the liberation of the mainland is approaching. Since last autumn and early spring this year, people in various regions, under the leadership of people's governments at all levels, have sown large quantities of winter wheat and spring wheat. In order to shorten the period of famine, many disaster areas have also planted a lot of winter wheat, spring wheat and other early-maturing crops. As the war on the mainland has ended, rural order is rapidly stabilizing, and the enthusiasm of the masses in various provinces for production is very high. When planting wheat, fine cultivation and large amounts of fertilizer were applied; this spring, a widespread weeding campaign was also carried out, coupled with timely rainfall, and the spring seedlings are growing exceptionally strong and luxuriant. If there are no other unexpected disasters, a bumper wheat harvest is expected across the country this year. According to existing materials: wheat seedlings in various parts of Northeast China have already covered the ridges, and in some areas have reached three inches in height. In the Tangshan Special District of Hebei, the area sown with spring wheat exceeds the original plan by 5.5 percent. There are many wheat fields in Pingyuan Province, which have generally been weeded one to three times. The recent rainfall was timely, and the wheat seedlings are even better. In the Yuncheng Special District of Shanxi, wheat has been weeded more than once, and the seedlings are vigorous. Fujian Province has a bumper harvest of new wheat. In western Fujian, the average yield per mu is 130 to 150 jin of wheat; in southern and eastern Fujian, the yield per mu is 200 to 250 jin of wheat, generally exceeding the previous years by 20 to 30 percent, and in some areas exceeding 60 percent. In Yongchun County, the average yield of dry wheat that can be harvested per jin of wheat seed is 55 jin (compared to 35 jin in previous years, with a maximum of 45 jin), which is unprecedented in decades. Wheat is growing well in Jiangxi and Hubei provinces, barley has been harvested, and Xiaogan produces 15 dou of barley per mu, exceeding the previous year's harvest. In Xiangcheng, Henan, barley has already emerged, wheat has already formed ears, and hyacinth bean flowers are in full bloom, presenting a scene of a bumper harvest. In Xuchang Special District, wheat plants are lush, barley can be harvested within half a month, and wheat can also be harvested within a month. It is estimated that the harvest will be 10 to 20 percent higher than last year. In the suburbs of Wuhan, all the wheat has emerged and flowered. In Qianjiang, Tiandong, Binyang and other places in Guangxi, wheat is nearing maturity, and farmers are actively preparing for the harvest. In the Xingmei Special District of Guangdong, wheat ears have turned yellow, which is also an unprecedented bumper harvest in the past 20 years. Wheat has been harvested in various parts of the Southwest, and the harvest in Sichuan, Yunnan and other provinces can generally reach about 80 percent. Rice seedlings are vigorous and as green as silk. Wheat in Shaanxi has grown to four feet high, reaching the chest, and is in the process of heading and flowering. Barley has already formed seeds and is turning white, with full grains. Pea plants are tall and sprawling, and the best ones have already flowered and formed pods. Other summer harvest crops such as hyacinth beans and rape are also bearing fruit and are large and plump. It is expected that they can be harvested around the time of Mangzhong (Grain in Ear).

Farmers in various regions, seeing the prospect of a bumper harvest, are joyfully and intensively carrying out preparations for the summer harvest and planting.

　　农村秩序安定雨水大致匀调
　　全国小麦可望丰收     
    广大农民欢快进行夏收夏种
    【新华社十四日讯】据中央人民政府农业部农政司消息：今年三、四月和五月上旬，全国大部地区都已先后普落透雨。入春以来，除黑龙江、贵州、内蒙之兴安盟、呼兰盟部分地区缺雨之外，其他地区都先后普降透雨。如果没有新的灾害，小麦丰收已有保证，春耕春播也可以顺利完成；而且不少曾发生虫害地区在落雨后虫势都已大杀。
    在所有已经落雨的地区，农民群众都欣喜地纷纷进行春耕春播，特别是各植棉地区如河北、山西、山东，已经普遍展开植棉运动。但也有一小部分地区，如苏北淮阴专区，皖北宿县专区，山东的苍县，河北天津专区，平原的荷泽、寿张，辽西的新民、开原、铁岭等地，因雨水过多，河堤决口成灾。上述地区人民政府现正领导农民进行排水救麦，向新的水灾作斗争。在缺雨或旱象严重的地区，当地人民政府也在领导播种早熟作物和进行抗旱点种。
    【本报讯】全国大陆解放后的第一个麦夏，即将到来。各地人民于去年秋后及今年春初，在各级人民政府领导下，曾大量播种冬麦和春麦。不少灾区，为缩短灾荒，也种植了不少冬麦、春麦及其他早熟作物。由于全国大陆战争已经结束，农村秩序迅速趋于安定，各省群众生产情绪均十分高涨。种麦时精耕细作、施肥量大；今春又普遍开展了锄麦运动，加之雨水调和，春苗长得异常茁壮繁茂。如无其他意外灾害，今年全国麦季可卜丰收。据现有材料：东北各地麦苗已经罩垅，部分地区已高达三寸。河北唐山专区，春麦播种面积，超过原计划百分之五点五。平原省麦田较多，一般已锄过一遍至三遍，月前落雨适时，麦苗更见良好。山西运城专区，小麦已锄过一遍以上，麦苗旺盛。福建全省新麦丰收，闽西平均每亩产麦一百三十斤至一百五十斤；闽南、闽东每亩产麦二百斤至二百五十斤，一般超过往年二成至三成，个别地区超过六成；永春县平均每斤麦种播种面积可收获干麦五十五斤（往年一般三十五斤，最多四十五斤），为数十年来所未有。江西、湖北等省小麦生长良好，大麦已收，孝感每亩产大麦十五斗，超过往年收成。河南襄城大麦已经出穗，小麦已经结苞，扁豆花盛开，呈现一片丰收景象；许昌专区麦棵茂盛，大麦半月内即可收割，小麦在一月以内亦可登场，估计收成将比去年多一成至二成。武汉市郊，麦子全部出穗扬花。广西迁江、田东、宾阳等地，小麦将近成熟，农民积极准备收获。广东兴梅专区麦穗已黄，亦为二十年来所未有的丰收。西南各地小麦已收，四川、云南等省收成一般可达八成左右。水稻秧苗旺盛，碧绿如绸。陕西小麦已高达四尺，齐及胸部，正吐穗扬花，大麦已经结籽，泛发白色，颗粒饱满；豌豆棵高蔓大，最好者已开花结荚；其他扁豆、油菜等夏收作物，也都结果肥大，预计芒种左右即可收割。
    各地农民，眼看丰收有望，正以无比的欢欣的心情，紧张进行夏收、夏种准备工作。
