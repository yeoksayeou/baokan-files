　　Regarding the Relationship Between Xinhua News Agency and Two Other Organizations
Editor:
    What is the relationship between Xinhua News Agency, Liberation Press, and Xinhua Broadcasting Station?
    Wen Bo

Mr. Wen Bo:
    Xinhua News Agency is a news agency. Its task is to edit and release news from home and abroad. Its predecessor was the Red China News Agency, founded in January 1932 in the Jiangxi Soviet. In December 1936, it was renamed Xinhua News Agency in Yan'an. In October of last year, with the birth of the People's Republic of China, Xinhua News Agency became the national news agency.
    Xinhua Broadcasting Station is the predecessor of the Central People's Broadcasting Station in Beijing. The task of the broadcasting station is to broadcast to listeners in language and music. In addition to news, language broadcasting programs also include various speeches, reports, entertainment programs, etc., so it is completely different from a news agency that sends messages in writing.
    China's first people's broadcasting station—Yan'an Xinhua Broadcasting Station—was established in September 1945 and was then under the jurisdiction of Xinhua News Agency. After moving to Beijing in March of last year, the broadcasting station was separated from Xinhua News Agency and was led by the Central Broadcasting Administration. Last year, the Central Government Information Administration was established, and the Central Broadcasting Administration was reorganized into the Broadcasting Affairs Bureau. The broadcasting stations under its jurisdiction were also renamed Central People's Broadcasting Station. The Broadcasting Affairs Bureau and Xinhua News Agency are both under the jurisdiction of the Information Administration.
    Liberation Press is a publishing organization that translates and publishes the works of Marxism-Leninism and the Chinese Communist Party, under the Central Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China. The books it publishes are distributed by Xinhua Bookstore.

### 关于新华社等三个机关的关系

　　关于新华社等三个机关的关系编者同志：
    新华社、解放社与新华广播电台的关系如何？
    文波文波君：
    新华通讯社是一个新闻通讯社。任务是编辑发布内外的消息。它的前身是一九三二年一月创始于江西苏区的红色中华社。一九三六年十二月在延安改名新华通讯社。去年十月，中华人民共和国诞生，新华通讯社成为国家通讯社。
    新华广播电台是北京中央人民广播电台的前身。广播电台的任务是用语言和音乐向听众广播，语言的广播节目中除新闻外还有各种演说、报告、游艺节目等，所以与用文字发消息的通讯社完全不同。
    中国第一座人民广播电台——延安新华广播电台于一九四五年九月设立，当时曾隶属于新华社。去年三月迁来北京后，广播电台由新华社分立出来，由中央广播事业管理处领导。去年中央人民政府新闻总署成立，中央广播事业管理处改组为广播事业局，所属广播电台也改名中央人民广播电台。广播事业局与新华通讯社同样隶属于新闻总署。
    解放社是一个编译出版马列主义和中国共产党著作的出版机关，隶属中国共产党中央宣传部。它所出版的书籍都由新华书店发行。
