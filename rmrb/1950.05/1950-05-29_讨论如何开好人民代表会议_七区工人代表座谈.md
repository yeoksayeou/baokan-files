Discussing How to Hold Good People's Representative Conferences
　　Seventh District Worker Representatives Hold Symposium
　　[Our Newspaper] The Seventh District People's Representative Conference is about to be convened, and preparations are underway. Fifty representatives elected from various public and private factories and industries in the district held a symposium on the evening of the 23rd. The symposium was divided into five groups, and the representatives enthusiastically discussed how to be good representatives and how to collect workers' opinions to bring to the conference for discussion. Everyone agreed that convening the district's People's Representative Conference could bring the government and the people closer together, and that opinions on the government could be raised, so that democracy could be better implemented. At the meeting, worker representatives actively offered opinions and expressed their feelings after becoming representatives. Zang Baoshan from Yuhua Xing Weaving Factory, Zhang Huamin from Jingwei Weaving Factory, and female worker Zhao Fuzhen said: "To be a representative, one must first publicize to the masses of workers and collect the opinions of the masses in a focused manner using various methods, and bring them to the meeting; after the meeting, one should convey the information to the masses. When we worker representatives are the leading class, so we must carefully consider before raising opinions and pay attention to uniting the four friends." Men Kairong, a worker at Zhi Xing Glass Factory, said: "We are 'roughnecks' and can't say pretty words, but we can honestly say what we have and speak the words of our workers." Chu Shouzhong, a construction worker, said: "Who elected worker representatives during the Kuomintang era? This representative conference is our working class participating in leadership, so we should strengthen unity and help the government do a good job in construction." Tricycle workers Ji Zhongkuan and Tan Baowen also expressed their feelings, saying: "In the past, tricycle workers were the lowest and despised by everyone. Now, we have become representatives and are discussing major government affairs!" They have recently collected many opinions from the masses and decided to hold another discussion in the next few days.

　　讨论如何开好人民代表会议
    七区工人代表座谈
    【本报讯】第七区各界人民代表会议即将召开，各项准备工作正在积极进行。该区各公私营工厂及各行业工人已选出的代表五十人，于二十三日晚举行了座谈会。座谈分五个小组进行，代表们热烈地讨论了如何当好代表，如何收集工人意见，以便提到大会上讨论等问题。大家一致认为召开区各界人民代表会议，可以使政府和人民的联系更加密切，对政府有意见就可以提，这样能更好地实行民主。会上，工人代表们积极提出意见并发表当了代表后的感想。裕华兴织布厂工人臧宝山、经纬织布厂工人张化民、女工赵甫珍等说：“当代表先要向工人群众宣传，有重点地用各种方法收集群众的意见，带到会议上去；开完会回去后，应向群众传达，开会时，我们工人代表是领导阶级，所以提意见之前先要好好的考虑，并要注意团结四个朋友。”知行玻璃厂工人门开荣说：“我们是‘老粗’，不会说漂亮话，但可以老老实实地有什么就提什么，说咱们工人的话。”建筑业工人褚寿仲说：“国民党时谁选过工人代表？这次代表会议就是咱们工人阶级参加领导，所以应加强团结，帮助政府把建设工作搞好。”三轮车工人纪中宽、谭保文也发表感想说：“过去三轮工人最低贱，谁也看不起，现在，咱们竟当了代表，商量政府的大事情了！”他们最近已收集了群众的许多意见，决定日内再举行座谈讨论。
