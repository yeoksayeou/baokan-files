　　I.
Today, we are holding this National Relief Representative Conference, which is of great significance. Because it is convened by the Chinese people's own government and people under the conditions that the basic liberation and near complete victory have been achieved throughout China. Only because the Chinese people, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism and established their own government, grasping the fate of China in their own hands, can the relief and welfare undertaking no longer be a decoration for the ruling class to deceive and paralyze the people, nor a solitary struggle of a few enthusiastic people, but a component of a series of works by the government and the people to heal the wounds of war and carry out peaceful construction with one heart and one mind. Therefore, it has new meaning and new content.

For a long time, the Chinese people have been under the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and they have struggled with poverty and disaster every day. For more than a century, the economic, political, and military aggression of capitalist imperialism against China has disintegrated the original urban and rural economy of China, causing the vast urban and rural handicraftsmen to fall into bankruptcy, and then combined with Chinese feudalism, strengthened the feudal exploitation of the Chinese people, and blocked the road to China's industrialization. The vast number of Chinese peasants, under intensified feudal exploitation, have increasingly fallen into the abyss of bankruptcy and poverty. This has formed the basic factor of the decline of national industrial and agricultural productivity and the poverty of the national people. The rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries was a rule of disaster: endless exploitation deepened the poverty of the people, and this man-made disaster inevitably caused natural disasters. The "disasters" suffered by the Chinese people for decades were precisely caused by the "misfortunes" of the Kuomintang reactionary group. Take the areas with relatively serious disasters at present, such as Hebei, Shandong, northern Jiangsu, and northern Anhui, these areas are also the areas where the Japanese imperialist war of aggression and the US-Chiang counter-revolutionary war have been going on for a relatively long time. Who doesn't know that the area flooded after the Yellow River dyke broke is precisely the Huai River basin? Who doesn't know that the large-scale destruction carried out by Chiang's bandits when attacking the Liberated Areas and before retreating is one of the main reasons for the current disaster situation? It is very clear that the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is the root cause of the poverty and disaster of the Chinese people. If these three enemies are not overthrown, the Chinese people will not be able to get rid of poverty and disaster, and therefore there will be no real welfare and relief undertaking.

Today, we have basically defeated these three enemies. We have won, and we have begun to get rid of disasters. But this is only the beginning of getting rid of disasters, and the disasters have not been completely overcome, because China, which has gone through a long period of war, needs time to heal the wounds of war. Famine is one of the wounds. Can we complete this work on the basis of self-reliance? We have no doubt that we can complete this work, and we are starting this work. The Chinese people, who can defeat the modernized enemy army in the war and liberate themselves, will inevitably be able to heal the wounds of war after the war and build China in peace.

　　II.
The cause of the Chinese people in healing the wounds of war and carrying out peaceful construction is a matter of concern to peace-loving people all over the world; but it is also hated by imperialists. The imperialists were the culprits in creating disasters in the past, and now they want to take advantage of our disaster situation to gloat and take advantage of the fire to carry out vicious propaganda and activities, and use various methods to engage in conspiracies and sabotage.

The US imperialists, headed by Acheson, helped Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang kill millions of Chinese people, and suddenly claimed to have "traditional friendship with China" and be "friends of the Chinese people," and are very "concerned" about China's "disaster situation." Acheson also held meetings with many religious groups to "discuss" the "Chinese disaster situation" and "ways to deal with it." Why "care"? Because it is said that "the severe disaster situation in China" is a "great opportunity for them to win back the hearts of the Chinese people and attack the Soviet Union," and they can "use this opportunity to drive a wedge between China and the Soviet Union." So they put forward the attached conditions of "relief," saying that "the United States should distribute it," "international supervision," and "guaranteed unobstructed." The method is to use private groups as vanguards to open the door for them to drill into China. Everyone can see very clearly that the imperialists' clamor about "disaster relief" is precisely a part of their so-called "Asian policy" that attempts to enslave the Asian people. The "humanitarian" cloak of disaster relief cannot conceal their political essence of attempting to undermine the People's China in all aspects.

The US imperialists have used relief as a means to carry out their reactionary political conspiracy more than once in history. Everyone knows about the notorious "Hoover Relief Mission." Who did this "relief mission" relieve? It distributed a large amount of grain to the areas occupied by the German imperialist army, and also supplied a large amount of grain to the areas occupied by the counter-revolutionary White Russian general Vodeni branch, helping them attack the young Soviet Federal Republic, and the staff of the Hoover Relief Mission were also American agents at the time, carrying out the US imperialists' task of undermining the Soviet Union.

Many representatives present today still remember the activities of the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" in China, manipulated by US imperialism. Although the charter of this organization is written very beautifully, saying that their work does not distinguish political beliefs, in fact, it is an organization that supports Chiang's bandit reactionary government and discriminates against the Liberated Areas. Our Liberated Areas Relief Federation has powerfully accused them of allocating only 2% of all relief materials to the vast Liberated Areas that suffered the most from the Japanese imperialist war of aggression; and the "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration" almost planned to send all the materials to Chiang Kai-shek's bandit gang, directly and indirectly helping it carry out the anti-people war.

Now the US imperialists are clamoring about "relieving" the Chinese people, but what are they actually doing? They are supporting and instigating Chiang's bandits' navy and air force to indiscriminately bomb China's peaceful cities and people, blockading China's ports, attempting to prevent China's foreign transportation, and undermining the Chinese people's peaceful construction. What is even more noteworthy is that they are also obstructing some grain-exporting countries in Southeast Asia from selling grain to the Chinese people. In this way, what is the purpose of the US imperialists' clamoring about "China's famine" and "helping China with disaster relief"? Is there any doubt? The Chinese people are already familiar with the conspiracy of US imperialism. Let the US imperialists continue to clamor! The Chinese people, who have defeated the American armed forces, will similarly defeat its every political conspiracy, no matter what kind of coat the conspiracy is wrapped in.

　　III.
Our relief and welfare work is a part of a series of huge works by our government and people working together to heal the wounds of war and carry out peaceful construction. In terms of the overall situation, liberating Taiwan and consolidating national defense; eradicating all imperialist privileges in China and ensuring national independence; implementing land reform step by step, liberating and improving the productivity of farmers; developing production, prospering the economy, and transforming agricultural countries into industrial countries; this is our basic work to heal the wounds of war and carry out peaceful construction. And strengthening production and saving, relieving famine and unemployment is a part of the current urgent work. These two tasks are interconnected and inseparable. Those of us who are engaged in relief and welfare work, on the one hand, must recognize the urgency of our own task and work hard; on the other hand, we must link this urgent task with the basic tasks mentioned above, because without realizing those basic tasks, our work has no solid foundation.

Regarding the part of our relief and welfare work on disaster relief, we can report to you that under the principle of self-reliance, we have limited the development of famine and are overcoming the severity of the disaster situation. At present, most of the disaster areas have smoothly entered into production, and 60% of the 40 million disaster victims can survive the disaster after organizing production and providing a little assistance, 20% do not need relief, and about 20% of those who are seriously affected by the disaster and have no labor force or insufficient labor force urgently need relief.

Our self-rescue method relies on the people, and it is a method that can only be adopted by a government that fully obtains the heartfelt support of the broad masses of the people. It is an extremely arduous, complex, and meticulous work. The main disaster relief method is that the government leads the people to help themselves, and at the same time, the government gives the disaster victims necessary and possible assistance. According to Vice Premier Chen Yun's recent report to the Central People's Government Committee, the government directly allocated more than 1.5 billion jin of grain for disaster relief and for use in disaster relief, of which nearly 400 million jin were for emergency relief. The government also plans to provide necessary supplementary relief to individual areas with particularly severe disaster situations. The government also transfers grain from areas with surplus grain to areas lacking grain, a large part of which must be transferred to disaster areas. This year, the Northeast transported 1.03 million tons of grain into the customs, and other places also have more than 500,000 tons of grain ready for transfer, and are prepared to increase the entry of grain from the Northeast into the customs when necessary. The scheduling of such a huge number of grains, entirely relying on our domestic strength, is unprecedented in Chinese history. In order to ensure that these grains are delivered to grain-deficient areas and disaster areas in a timely manner, we have organized a huge transportation network. In addition to using the railways, highways, and waterways that we have quickly restored after liberation, we have also mobilized and organized labor and backward transportation tools, which guarantees that a certain amount of grain can reach remote disaster areas.

Our disaster relief is not just about distributing relief. We believe that the most important thing is to organize and help people carry out production. We have planned to adopt and resolutely implement the policy of combining disaster relief with production and using work as relief. At the beginning of this year, we launched a vast spring plowing campaign. According to the rainfall this spring, if no accidents occur, this year's wheat can be guaranteed a good harvest.

We have carried out and are carrying out various water conservancy, river management, tree planting, and promotion of rural sideline production work, the purpose of which is not only to plan to relieve the current famine, but also to plan to prevent future famines.

We are also carrying out unemployment relief in cities. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has issued a call to relieve unemployed workers, and trade unions, factories, government agencies, schools, and troops in various places are responding to this call. The government is also prepared to allocate the necessary funds for relieving unemployed workers. At the same time, strengthening production and saving, reducing national expenditures, and promoting the improvement of the entire financial economy is also conducive to the progress of relief work.

All of these achievements prove that the Chinese people, under the leadership of their own government, are able to overcome all difficulties.

　　IV.
Based on the above analysis, the relief and welfare undertaking of our new democratic country should be a mass relief and welfare undertaking carried out under the leadership of the People's Government and based on the people's self-reliance.

This relief and welfare undertaking is for the masses of the people, because it was precisely the masses of the people who were under the heavy oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in the past, and among them, the working and peasant masses suffered the most from disasters and were the poorest. Now, with the wounds of war, those affected by disasters in rural areas and those unemployed in cities are mostly workers and peasants. Therefore, in the future, the relief and welfare undertaking of the new China must take the masses of the people as the object, and among them, unemployed workers and people in disaster areas should be relieved first.

This relief and welfare undertaking must be based on the people's self-reliance and self-help, because the relief and welfare undertaking of the masses of the people must rely on the people themselves to be solved. It is by no means relying on any relief outside the people to solve any problems. Today, standing outside the Chinese people are the imperialists, feudal landlords, bureaucratic capitalists, and the remnants of the Kuomintang reactionaries. They are the creators of the disasters and poverty of the Chinese people. They have been overthrown or have been overthrown. How can we imagine doing relief and welfare work beneficial to the Chinese people from their hands? We affirm that the Chinese people are capable of self-reliance and self-help, and have already achieved indelible achievements in self-reliance and self-help. To carry out the relief and welfare undertaking for the broad masses of the people, only by organizing the people's own strength, producing and saving, and helping each other in labor, can we find the most guaranteed, reliable, and inexhaustible source. After the national land reform, if each of the 400 million rural population produces only 10 more jin of rice, we can get 2 million tons of coarse grains throughout the year. In this way, what relief and welfare undertaking cannot be done? The great Chinese people will carry out a great relief and welfare undertaking after healing the wounds of war.

This relief and welfare undertaking must be under the leadership of the People's Government, because the People's Government relies on the people and serves the people. Only it can mobilize all the people, organize the people's strength, engage in relief and welfare undertakings, and properly and comprehensively allocate and schedule manpower, materials, and financial resources without waste, bias, untimely use, or improper use. At the same time, only it can comprehensively analyze various situations, distinguish and expose the enemy's various conspiracies and tricks, and be responsible for protecting the relief and welfare undertaking of the masses of the people. This is the democratic centralized system that the new democratic country must adopt, and the relief and welfare undertaking is no exception.

The relief and welfare undertaking of the new democratic country, under the leadership of the People's Government, should absorb the participation of individuals and groups. All individuals and groups engaged in genuine relief and welfare work, as long as they agree with the guidelines we have jointly stipulated and are willing to work under the leadership of the People's Government, we have the responsibility and obligation to cooperate with them and absorb them to participate in relief representative conferences and relief organizations at all levels. The working guidelines of the national relief and welfare undertaking should be unified; the work plans and scope, as well as the arrangement of manpower, materials, and financial resources, should be organically coordinated; the publicity and actions should be consistent. In order to achieve the above requirements, relief organizations at all levels should accommodate representatives engaged in relief and welfare work to form consultative conferences for regular discussions. In the past, some relief organizations that needed to be transformed should be led to carry out the transformation after the establishment of the national relief agency. Some relief organizations that exist in name only or have completely lost their function or pretend to be good should be announced to be cancelled. Only after this rectification can the relief and welfare undertaking of the Chinese people move forward in a down-to-earth manner towards fully complying with the interests of the masses of the people.

The relief and welfare undertaking of the new democratic country naturally does not reject and welcomes the genuine and well-intentioned assistance of international friends. But today we are already a victorious China, and we should no longer be the same as in the past. In the past, the Chinese people were under heavy oppression from the enemy and needed the assistance of international friends to strengthen our momentum, lengthen our strength, expose the enemy's brutality, and shake the enemy's camp. Now the enemy who oppressed us has been overthrown, and the true international friends who assisted the Chinese people in the past are now suffering oppression in imperialist countries and colonial and semi-colonial countries just like the oppression we suffered in the past, or even more. Therefore, what needs assistance now is not us, but them. We thank them for their past assistance, and now we should turn around and assist them. In the future, in our relations with the people of these countries, we should be saving and helping people, not seeking help from people. Even in the relationship with overseas Chinese, we should also change the concept of seeking help from overseas Chinese in the past to the concept of helping overseas Chinese relieve their pain. As for the Soviet Union and the new democratic countries, they are all fraternal countries with us, and there should be equal mutual assistance, not just hoping for help from people, but not helping people.

Completely opposite to the above situation is that in imperialist countries, some individuals and groups, with the approval or acquiescence of their governments, attempt to use the so-called "assistance" with conditions, plus the so-called "representatives" or "delegations" who take this opportunity to drill into China, to carry out the activities of the likes of Acheson and Lattimore, that is, what they call to drive a wedge between China and the Soviet Union, or between the Chinese People's Government and the Chinese people, or between various parts of the Chinese people. Just imagine, can the Chinese people allow and accept such an insult and manipulation of this kind of "assistance" specially permitted by US imperialism, coming together with the planes and warships that aided Chiang's bandits? No, we should say: The Chinese people are absolutely not tempted.

The Chinese people, who have already stood up, are facing some difficulties due to the wounds left over by the reactionary rule and the counter-revolutionary war, but these difficulties are difficulties in victory, difficulties in transitioning from the old system and old methods to the new system and new methods. We have full confidence in overcoming these difficulties, and we can foresee that the situation will fundamentally change in two or three years. The threats and lures of the imperialists cannot scare us, nor can they confuse us. Let them fail and be disappointed to the end! The people of the new China, in the relief and welfare undertaking, just as in all other undertakings, will firmly and steadily embark on their own road to victory.

　　新中国的救济福利事业
    一九五零年四月二十六日在中国人民救济代表会议上的报告
    董必武
    一
    今天，我们召开了这个全国救济代表会议，是有重大意义的。因为它是中国人民自己的政府和人民在全中国已经基本解放接近全胜的条件之下召开的。只是因为中国人民在毛主席领导下，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，并成立了自己的政府，把中国的命运掌握在自己手中，救济福利事业才不再是统治阶级欺骗与麻痹人民的装饰品，也不再是少数热心人士的孤军苦斗，而是政府和人民同心协力医治战争创伤并进行和平建设一系列工作中的一个组成部分。因此，它就有了新的意义和新的内容。
    中国人民长期处在帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治下，没有一天不与贫穷和灾难相搏斗。百余年来，资本帝国主义对中国所进行的经济、政治和军事的侵略，瓦解了中国原来的城乡经济，使广大的城乡手工业者沦于破产，并进而和中国的封建主义相结合，加强了封建主义对于中国人民的剥削，阻塞了中国工业化的道路。中国广大的农民，在加强了的封建剥削之下，日益陷于破产和贫困的深渊。这就形成了全国工农业生产力的低落和全国人民贫困的基本因素。国民党反动集团的统治就是一种灾难的统治：无止境的剥削加深了人民的贫困，而这种人为的灾难又不可避免地引起天然的灾难。中国人民几十年来所遭受的“灾”，正是国民党反动集团的“祸”所造成的。就拿目前灾情比较严重的地区河北、山东、苏北、皖北来说，这些地区也正是日本帝国主义的侵略战争和美蒋反革命战争进行的比较久的地区。谁不知道黄河决堤后泛滥的地区正是淮河流域？谁不知道蒋匪在进攻解放区的时候及在溃退前所施行的大规模的破坏，是造成目前灾情的主要原因之一？很清楚，帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治，是中国人民贫穷和灾难的总根源，这三个敌人不推翻，中国人民就脱离不了贫穷和灾难，因此也就无从进行真正的福利和救济事业。
    今天，我们已经基本上战胜了这三个敌人。我们胜利了，我们已开始脱离灾难。但这只是开始脱离灾难，灾难并没有完全克服，因为经过长期战争的中国，战争的创伤是需要时间医治的。灾荒正是创伤的一种。我们能不能在自力更生的基础上完成这一工作呢？我们毫不怀疑，我们是能够完成这一工作，而且正在开始这一工作。我们中国人民既能在战争中战胜近代化的敌人军队，解放了自己，我们也就必然能够在战后医好战争创伤，在和平中建设中国。
    二
    中国人民医治战争创伤、进行和平建设的事业，是全世界爱好和平的人士所关怀的；但也是帝国主义者所仇视的。帝国主义者过去既是制造灾荒的罪魁，现在又想借口我们的灾情来幸灾乐祸、趁火打劫地进行恶毒的宣传和活动，并运用各种不同的方法来从事阴谋破坏的工作。
    以艾奇逊等为首的美帝国主义者，帮助蒋介石匪帮杀死了几百万中国人之后，忽而自称与“中国有传统的友谊”，是“中国人民的朋友”，对中国的“灾情”是很“关怀”的。艾奇逊并曾和许多宗教团体开过会，“商讨”“中国灾情”和“对付办法”。为什么“关怀”呢？因为据说，“中国灾情严重”是他们“争回中国民心，打击苏联的大好机会”，可以“利用这机会在中苏之间打下一个楔子”，于是他们提出“救济”的附带条件，说“要美国来发放”，“国际监督”，“有保证不受阻挠”。进行的方法，则打算利用私人团体为前锋，替他们打开可以钻进中国的大门。大家看得很清楚，帝国主义者关于“救灾”的叫嚣，正是他们企图奴役亚洲人民的所谓“亚洲政策”的一部分。救灾的“人道”外衣，掩盖不了他们企图从各方面破坏人民中国的政治实质。
    美帝国主义者以救济为手段，进行其反动的政治阴谋，在历史上已不只是一次。大家都知道的有过那臭名昭彰的“胡佛救济团”。这个“救济团”救济了些什么人呢？它把大量粮食分配给德国帝国主义军队侵占的地区，又供应了大量粮食给反革命的白俄将领沃德尼支占领的地区，帮助他们进攻年青的苏维埃联邦共和国，而胡佛救济团的工作人员则同时就是当时的美国特务，执行着美帝破坏苏联的任务。
    今天到会的不少代表，当还记得美帝国主义操纵的“联合国善后救济总署”在中国的活动。虽然这个机构的宪章写得很漂亮，说他们的工作是不分政治信仰的，但事实上，它是一个支持蒋匪反动政府歧视解放区的组织。我们解放区救济总会曾经有力地指斥过他们对受日本帝国主义侵略战争祸害最深的广大解放区仅分配了全部救济物资的百分之二；而“联总”几乎是以全部的物资有计划地送给了蒋介石匪帮，直接间接地帮助它进行反人民的战争。
    现在美帝国主义者口口声声叫嚣“救济”中国人民，但实际上他们在做些什么呢？他们正在支持并指使蒋匪的海空军滥炸中国的和平城市与人民，封锁中国的港口，企图阻止中国的对外交通，破坏中国人民的和平建设。更值得注意的是他们还在南洋各地阻挠那里一些粮食出口国家出卖粮食给中国人民。这样看来，美帝国主义所叫嚣的“中国灾荒”以及“帮助中国救灾”的目的在那里，还有什么可以怀疑的吗？中国人民对美帝国主义的阴谋早已熟悉，让美帝国主义者继续叫嚣吧！已经战胜了美国武装的中国人民，是会同样地战胜它的每一个政治阴谋的，不管那阴谋是包藏在什么样的外衣里边。
    三
    我们的救济福利工作，是我们政府和人民同心协力医治战争创伤、进行和平建设的一系列巨大工作中的一部分。就全局来说，解放台湾，巩固国防；肃清帝国主义在华一切特权，保证民族独立；有步骤地实行土地改革，解放并提高农民生产力；发展生产，繁荣经济，变农业国为工业国；这是我们医治战争创伤、进行和平建设的基本工作。而加强生产节约，救济灾荒失业，则是当前紧急工作的一部分。这两项工作是互相联系，不可分割的。我们从事救济福利工作的人，一方面，必须认清我们自己这一任务的紧急性，努力以赴；另一方面，又必须把这个紧急任务和上面说的基本任务联系起来，因为不实现那些基本任务，我们的工作是没有坚实的基础的。
    我们救济福利工作中关于救灾的这一部分，我们可以向大家报告的是在自力更生的原则下，我们已经限制了灾荒的发展，并正在克服着灾情的严重性。目前，大部分的灾区已顺利地转入生产，四千万灾民中已经有百分之六十经过组织生产和略加扶助即可渡过灾荒，百分之二十不需救济，受灾重而无劳动力或劳动力不足急需救济的约百分之二十。
    我们的自救办法是依靠人民的，它是只有充分地得到广大人民衷心拥护的政府才可能采取的办法。它是极其艰巨、既复杂而又细密的工作。主要的救灾办法是政府领导人民互助自救，同时政府又给灾民以必要的和可能的救助。据陈云副总理最近在中央人民政府委员会上的报告，政府直接拨给救灾和拨给可以利用于救灾的粮食，超过了十五亿斤，其中紧急救济粮差不多有四亿斤。政府还打算对个别灾情特重的地区，予以必需的补充救济。政府又从有余粮的地区调运粮食，输往缺粮地区，其中当然有很大部分要输往灾区。东北今年有一百零三万吨粮食运入关内，其他各地亦有五十余万吨的粮食准备调用，并且准备在必要时增加东北的粮食入关。调度这样巨大数字的粮食，完全依靠我们国内的力量，这在中国历史上是空前的。为了使这些粮食及时送到缺粮区和灾区，我们组织了庞大的运输网，除了利用解放后我们迅速恢复了的铁道、公路和航路外，我们还动员和组织了劳动力和落后的运输工具，这就保证了一定数量的粮食能达到偏僻的灾区。
    我们的救灾，不只是放赈。我们认为最重要的是组织和帮助人民进行生产。我们有计划地采取并坚决地执行了救灾与生产结合及以工代赈的政策。今年年初我们展开了广大的春耕运动。照今春的雨水看来，如不发生意外，今年麦子是可以保证丰收的。
    我们已进行了并在进行着各种水利、治河、植树和增进农村副业生产的工作，其目的不仅在有计划地救济目前的灾荒，而且也是有计划地防止将来的灾荒。
    我们也正在进行城市的失业救济。中华全国总工会已发出救济失业工人的号召，各地工会、工厂、机关、学校、部队正在响应这一号召。政府并准备拨出必要的经费用于救济失业工人。同时，加强生产节约，减少国家开支，以利整个财政经济的好转，亦即有利救济工作的进行。
    所有这一些成就，证明了中国人民在自己的政府领导之下，是能够克服一切困难的。
    四
    根据以上的分析，我们新民主主义国家的救济福利事业，应该是在人民政府领导之下，以人民自救自助为基础而进行的人民大众的救济福利事业。
    这个救济福利事业之所以为人民大众的，因为过去在帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义重重压迫之下的正是人民大众，而其中灾难最深穷困最甚的又为工农大众，现在带着战争创伤，在农村受灾城市失业的，亦以工农为最。故今后新中国的救济福利事业，必以人民大众为对象，其中应首先救济失业工人及灾区人民。
    这个救济福利事业之所以要以人民自救自助为基础，是因为人民大众的救济福利事业，必须依靠人民自己，才能得到解决，绝不是依靠人民以外的任何救济，能够解决什么问题。今天站在中国人民以外的是帝国主义者、封建地主、官僚资本家和国民党反动派残余，他们是中国人民灾难和穷困的制造者，他们是被打倒者或者已经被打倒了，如何能想象从他们手中做出有利于中国人民的救济福利工作？我们肯定中国人民是能够自救自助的，而且已经获得自救自助之不可磨灭的成绩。进行广大人民的救济福利事业，只有组织起人民自己的力量，生产节约，劳动互助，才是最有保障最可信赖而又取之不竭的源泉。全国土地改革后，四万万的农村人口，每人只要多生产十斤米，全年就可得到二百万吨粗粮。如此，什么救济福利事业做不出？伟大的中国人民在医治战争创伤后，将会做出伟大的救济福利事业。
    这个救济福利事业之所以要在人民政府领导下，是因为人民政府是依靠人民，又为人民服务的。只有它，才能够动员全体人民，组织人民力量，从事救济福利事业，并适当地全面地分配和调度人力、物力、财力而不致浪费、偏重、用不及时或用之不当。同时，也只有它，才能综合各种情况，辨别和揭破敌人的各种阴谋诡计，并负责保卫人民大众的救济福利事业。这是新民主主义国家必须采取的民主的集中制度，救济福利事业亦不能例外。
    新民主主义国家的救济福利事业，在人民政府领导之下，应该吸收个人和团体参加。一切从事真正救济福利工作的个人和团体，只要他们赞成我们共同规定的方针，愿意在人民政府领导之下工作，我们就有责任和义务同他们合作，并吸收他们参加各级救济代表会议和救济组织。全国救济福利事业的工作方针，应该是统一的；工作计划和范围以及人力、物力、财力的安排，应该是有机配合的；宣传和行动，应该是一致的。为实现上述要求，各级救济组织应容纳从事救济福利工作的代表人物，组成协商性质的会议，进行经常讨论。过去某些救济团体须改造的，在全国救济机构成立以后，即应由其领导进行改造。某些名存实亡或已完全失其作用或假冒为善的救济团体，应即宣布取消。只有经过这番整理，中国人民的救济福利事业，才能脚踏实地地向着完全符合于人民大众的利益前进。
    新民主主义国家的救济福利事业，自然也并不拒绝而且欢迎国际友人的真正善意的援助。但我们今天已经是胜利的中国，不应该再与过去一样，在过去，中国人民处在敌人重重压迫之下，需要国际友人援助，以壮我声势，长我力量，暴露敌人残暴，动摇敌人阵营。现在压迫我们的敌人已被推翻，而过去援助中国人民的真正国际友人，他们现在在帝国主义国家及殖民地半殖民地国家中所受的压迫却正如我们过去所受的压迫一样，或犹过之。因此，现在需要援助的，不是我们，而是他们。我们感谢他们过去的援助，现在则应反过来援助他们。我们今后在对这些国家的人民关系上，应是救人助人，而不是求人救，求人助。连对华侨的关系，我们也应改变过去求助于华侨的观念为助华侨解除痛苦的观念。至于苏联和新民主主义国家与我们都是兄弟之邦，应是平等互助，不应只望人助，而不助人。
    与以上情况完全相反的，那就是在帝国主义国家中，有些个人和团体得到他们政府的批准或默许，企图以有条件的所谓“援助”，加上借此钻进中国的所谓“代表”或“代表团”，来进行艾奇逊、拉铁摩尔之流的勾当，即他们所谓要在中苏之间或中国人民政府与中国人民之间或中国各部分人民之间打入一个楔子。试想，这种经美帝国主义特许的“援助”，与其援助蒋匪的飞机军舰同来，中国人民能容许接受这种侮辱和玩弄么？不能的，我们应该说一声：中国人民是绝不受诱惑的。
    已经站起来了的中国人民，虽因反动统治及反革命战争遗留下来的创伤，正面对着若干困难，但这种困难是胜利中的困难，是从旧制度旧方式转入新制度新方式的困难，我们是有充分的信心去克服这些困难的，并且可以预见：在两三年后情形将基本改观。帝国主义者的威胁利诱，既吓不倒我们，也迷惑不了我们。让他们失败失望到底罢！新中国人民在救济福利事业中也正和在一切其他事业中一样，将坚定而稳步地走上自己的胜利道路。
