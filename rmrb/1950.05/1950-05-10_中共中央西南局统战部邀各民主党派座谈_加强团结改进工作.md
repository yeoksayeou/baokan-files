Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 9th: According to the Guangming Daily today, the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee Southwest Bureau invited the responsible persons of the local organizations of various democratic parties in Chongqing to hold a symposium on the 11th of last month. The attendees included the responsible persons of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Democratic League, the China National Democratic Construction Association, and the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in Chongqing. Representatives from the Southwest Military and Political Committee and the Chongqing Municipal People's Government also attended. At the meeting, Lin Meng of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee Southwest Bureau first explained that the symposium was held in accordance with the spirit of the CPC Central Committee's instruction to the whole party to study the document "Stalin and Mao Zedong on Communists' Ability to Unite and Cooperate with Non-Party Masses." In their speeches, the representatives of the democratic parties unanimously affirmed the achievements of the Communist Party and the People's Government in Southwest China and Chongqing; they also made sincere criticisms of the shortcomings in the work. Everyone believed that in order to strengthen unity and cooperation, it is necessary to strengthen the ties between the democratic parties in the future. The representatives also put forward some suggestions on suppressing bandits, promoting trade between urban and rural areas, and adjusting labor-capital relations. At the same time, they also made well-intentioned criticisms of individual Chinese Communist Party members, cadres, and lower-level administrative and public security personnel of the People's Government, due to their lack of experience in managing cities, resulting in low work efficiency, or some of them having shortcomings such as arrogance, coercion, and rigid working methods. Finally, Cao Diqiu, on behalf of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC and the Chongqing Municipal People's Government, welcomed the spirit of the representatives to "speak freely and exhaustively," and believed that these opinions would help in the implementation of policies and municipal construction. It was hoped that in the future, the democratic parties would hold regular meetings, exchange information, and exchange opinions at any time to improve their work.
