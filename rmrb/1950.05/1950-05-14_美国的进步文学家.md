American Progressive Writers
By Romanov Translated by Wang Jin

In the United States today, a broader mass of people with different views and beliefs have united in a common struggle against the warmongers—the adventurous policies of the imperialists. In this vigorous movement for peace and democracy, American progressive writers have played an important role. Only they, these heroic and faithful artists, have the right to represent the real America, to speak for the American people. Their healthy, life-affirming creations stand in stark contrast to the misanthropic, decadent works and the glorification of sin, the garbage being dumped into the American and European book markets by the lackeys of the American reactionaries.

The words of people who occupy an important position in American cultural life, and the many books and articles published in recent years, show that American progressive intellectuals are resolutely fighting to defend peace.

Howard Fast wrote that the American people are unwilling to die for the Atlantic Pact, and only the strong unity of the people's forces can guarantee life, peace, and a better future for mankind.

This talented writer is one of the most outstanding peace fighters. Readers with democratic ideas are very fond of Fast's historical novels, in which he bravely sweeps away the reactionary myths of American history fabricated by official historians. In his best works, Fast elucidates the true nature of American bourgeois "democracy," from its beginnings ("Citizen Tom Paine", "The Unvanquished", etc.) to the second half of the nineteenth century ("The Last Frontier", "Freedom Road", "The American"). But Tom Paine, Altgeld, and others who fought for and won American independence, opposed the ever-increasing oppression of the exploiters, and defended their own rights, belong to a distant past era. After painting the history of America in true images, Fast turned to depicting today's America, writing a novel set in American society in the second half of 1945, "Clarkton."

The struggle for peace and democracy has become a banner held high by righteous men and women of different political beliefs, different professions, different nationalities, and different eras. The Communist Party of the United States played an important role in this movement.

The protagonist of Fast's novel is a worker in a factory in Clarkton. It is the working class that rises up to resist the terror tactics of the reactionaries, suffering the combined attacks of the dregs of human society—provocateurs, strikebreakers, spies, capitalist running dogs, and Nazi secret agents resurrected in the United States.

The author draws concrete facts from real life, showing that fascism, which was defeated in Europe, has taken deep root in the United States, and the reactionaries are using all kinds of tricks to establish their rule. The American version of fascism attempts to sweep away all obstacles in its path.

Fast gives detailed and realistic descriptions of the activities of his progressive characters, including the Communists. He convincingly illustrates the fact that their struggle has been supported by the best elements in American society, regardless of their status, who have recognized that the working class is the only effective force capable of resisting fascism. Neither police persecution nor torture can make the heroes in Fast's books bow their heads in submission. They are fearless, they possess the highest moral qualities, and they fight for the principles they advocate. The author does not attempt to conceal the difficulties they encounter, but he believes that final victory belongs to the people, and he conveys this belief to the reader.

At the end of Fast's book rings a life-affirming cry. He shows that the broad masses of the people and workers are a great force that makes the employer class and their lackeys, the club-wielding police and detectives, tremble in fear.

Howard Fast has written many important articles on the current American social situation and artistic issues.

He urges other writers to portray the struggle against reactionary forces with greater realism, and to deal with the stories and characters in their works with a sharp political perspective. "Clarkton" is a good example of the practical application of his own claims.

Novelist, playwright, and short story writer Albert Maltz is a versatile author who, with simple structures and two or three characters, exposes the ugliness and inhumanity of the American way of life. As early as 1940, his "The Underground Stream" not only exposed the reactionary reality of American capitalism, but also, further, he portrayed those who strive to change this reality, and fight against the fascistization of America. "The Cross and the Arrow" is a novel published by Maltz during World War II, and it was one of the few serious American anti-fascist novels of that time.

Among Maltz's many works, "The Underground Stream" is particularly noteworthy. The symbolic title clearly suggests the people's widespread anger at the crimes of American capitalism, and the people's widespread feeling that the "iron heel" of imperialist monopolistic capitalists is imposing fascist police rule on the United States. He speaks of the real threat of American fascism, and points out its origins.

Maltz's novel, although optimistic on the whole, ends with the tragic death of a progressive worker as the protagonist, who is killed by the fascist "Blackshirts."

The young writer Alexander Saxton's "The Great Midland" has attracted great attention from progressives.

The protagonist is Dav Spaak, a railroad worker. The author shows this character gradually growing under the influence of political events. The reader sees the molding of his consciousness, and the process of tempering his will. This progressive American worker is stubbornly striving towards his goal—that is, to unite the entire working force on the great railway line he is employed on.

Saxton successfully depicts the profound psychological portraits of the workers, simple, yet heroic, and full of emotion. In portraying their daily lives and struggles, the author proves that he has full knowledge and complete understanding of the working conditions of railway workers and their family environment.

He unfolds an epic story full of dramatic events—a picture of American workers fighting heroically to defend their rights.

The works of Maltz, Fast, Saxton, and other American progressive writers illustrate the new progressive phenomenon in American literature. (Abridged translation from "Soviet Literature," November 1949, "The Problem of American Progressive Literature")

　　美国的进步文学家
    罗曼诺夫作　王进译
    在美国，今天已有更广大的具有不同观点和信仰的人民群众为反对新战争的挑拨者——帝国主义者的冒险政策而结合成一个共同的斗争了。在这个为和平民主而斗争的蓬勃的运动中，美国的进步作家们担负了一个重要的角色。只有他们，这些英勇的、忠实的艺术家们才有权利代表真正的美国，代表美国的老百姓来说话。他们的健康的、对生命肯定的创作恰好和那些厌世的、颓废的作品和歌颂罪恶的垃圾作显著的对比，这些垃圾正由美国反动派的帮闲们倾销到美国和欧洲的书籍市场上去。
    在美国文化生活中占有重要地位的人所说的话和近几年来所出版的许多书籍和文章，都显示了美国的进步知识分子是坚决为保卫和平而奋斗的。
    哈华特·法斯特（Howard Fast）曾写道，美国人民不愿意为大西洋公约去死，只有人民力量的坚强团结，才能保证生命、和平和人类的较好的未来。
    这位有才能的作家是最杰出的和平战士之一。具有民主思想的读者们十分喜爱法斯特的历史小说，在这些作品中，他勇敢地扫清了官方历史家所捏造的美国历史的反动的神话。法斯特在他的最好的著作中，阐明了美国资产阶级“民主”的真正的本质，从它的开端起（《由自由所孕育的》，《不可征服的》等书）以至十九世纪后半（《最后的边疆》，《自由之路》，《美国人》等书）。但是汤姆·潘恩（Tom Paine）亚尔特格尔特（Altgeld）等为美国独立而战斗并赢得胜利，反对剥削者的继续增长的压迫，保卫他们自己的权利的那些农民，都是属于遥远的过去时代的人物。在以真实的形象绘画了美国的历史之后，法斯特转而描写今天的美国，他写了一部以一九四五年下半年的美国社会为背景的小说《克拉格顿》（Clarkton）。
    为和平民主而斗争，已经成为不同政治信仰，不同职业，不同民族，不同年代的正义的男女们所高举的一面大旗。美国共产党在这个运动中担任了一个重要的角色。
    法斯特的这本小说中的主角是克拉格顿的一家工厂中的工人。起来反抗反动派的恐怖手段的是工人阶级，他们遭受着人类社会的渣滓——挑拨者、罢工破坏者、奸细、资本家的走狗、以及在美国复活了的纳粹特务——的联合的袭击。
    作者从现实生活中吸取具体事实，表现出在欧洲被击溃了的法西斯主义已经深深地植根在美国，反动派运用一切伎俩来建立它的统治。法西斯主义的美国版企图扫除它前进路上的一切障碍。
    法斯特给他的进步角色们，包括共产党员们的活动以详细的真实的描写。他令人信服地说明了这个事实，他们所进行的斗争已得到美国社会中的最优秀分子，不管他们的地位如何，来支持他们，这些人们已经认识了工人阶级是能够抵抗法西斯主义的唯一的有效的力量。不论警察的迫害或是酷刑都不能叫法斯特书中的英雄们低头屈膝。他们是无畏的，他们具有最高的道德的品质为他们所主张的原则而斗争。作者没有企图掩饰他们所遭遇的困难，但是他相信最后的胜利是属于人民的，并把这信念传达给读者。
    在法斯特的书的末尾响彻着对生命肯定的呼声。他表现出广大人民和工人是一支伟大的力量，使雇主阶级及其走狗，挥舞着木棍的警察和侦探们，为之胆战心惊。
    哈华特·法斯特写过许多对目前美国社会状况和艺术问题的重要文章。
    他促请别的作家们以更高的现实主义来刻划对反动势力的斗争，要以尖锐的政治观点去处理他们作品中的故事和角色。《克拉格顿》是他自己的主张的实际运用的很好的例证。
    小说家、剧作家、短篇小说家亚尔倍特·玛尔兹（Albert Maltz）是一个具有多样才能的作者，他以简单的结构，两三个角色，暴露了美国方式生活的丑恶和非人道。早在一九四○年他的《潜流》（The Underground Stream）就非但暴露了美国资本主义的反动实况，并且，进一步，他表现了那些努力改变这个现实，和美国的法西斯化斗争的人们。《十字架和箭》（The cross andthe Arrow）是玛尔兹在第二次世界大战时期内出版的一部小说，它是那时很少数的严肃的美国反法西斯小说中的一本。
    在玛尔兹的许多作品中，《潜流》是值得特别提起的。这象征的书名明显地暗示了人民对美国资本主义罪恶的普遍的愤怒，以及人民普遍地感觉到帝国主义的独占资本家的“铁蹄”正在把法西斯的警察统治强施于美国。他说出了美国法西斯主义的真正威胁，并指出它的根源。
    玛尔兹的小说，虽则整个地说来是乐观主义的，但结尾是作为主角的一个进步工人的悲剧的死亡，他是被法西斯“黑衫团”杀死的。
    青年作家亚历山大·萨克斯顿（Alexander Saxton）的《伟大的中部》（The Great Midland）引起了进步人士的很大的注意。?
    主角是达夫·斯巴克（Dav spaak），一个铁路工人。作者表现这个人物在政治事件的影响下逐渐成长。读者看到他的意识的模造，和他的意志的锻炼经过，这位进步的美国工人是顽强地向他的目标努力着的——那就是把他所受雇的那条大铁道线上的整个工人力量团结起来。
    萨克斯顿成功地描绘了工人们的深刻的心理的肖像，单纯的，然而是英勇的，充满着感情。在刻划他们的日常生活和战斗时，作者证明了他是具有充分的知识，完全了解铁路工人的工作情况和他们的家庭环境的。
    他展开了一个充满戏剧性事件的史诗式的故事——一幅美国工人为保卫他们的权利而英勇斗争的图画。
    玛尔兹、法斯特、萨克斯顿和别的美国进步作家们的著作说明了美国文学的新的进步的现象。（节译自《苏联文学》一九四九年十一月号《美国进步文学问题》）
