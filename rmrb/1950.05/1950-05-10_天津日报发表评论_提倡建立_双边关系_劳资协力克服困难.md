Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 8th. The Tianjin Daily published a commentary entitled "Labor and Management Cooperate to Overcome Difficulties" regarding the agreement signed by labor and management in the city's machine dyeing and finishing industry on temporary measures to overcome difficulties. The commentary stated: "In the current situation of market shrinkage, weak farmer purchasing power, and sluggish sales, the workers in this industry voluntarily reduce their living standards, tighten their belts, endure temporary hardship, and cooperate with the capitalists to maintain production. This great spirit of subordinating individual interests to the overall interest and the self-sacrificing spirit of self-discipline is truly moving and admirable!"

The commentary pointed out: "The difficulties currently encountered by some private industries are difficulties in the victory and progress of the entire people's cause; they are temporary difficulties and can be completely overcome." The commentary said: "Now, the workers in many factories have expressed their determination to maintain production with practical actions of self-sacrifice. However, in order to overcome difficulties, both labor and management have responsibilities. We believe that everyone has reason to demand that the owners of these enterprises honestly contribute capital and effort to maintain their businesses. If only the workers reduce their treatment without the active management of the capitalists, that is called a "unilateral relationship." A unilateral relationship is unequal and one-sided, and nothing can be done well. We advocate establishing a "bilateral relationship" where labor and management cooperate, everyone comes up with ideas, and work together to overcome the difficulties. Some private enterprise operators have already shown the courage to overcome difficulties, adding capital, improving business, and actively maintaining their businesses; others have been moved by the workers' self-sacrificing actions, voluntarily disclosing their accounts, and seeking to increase shares to restart factories that have been shut down. These phenomena are good and worthy of emulation. However, there are also a few capitalists who, in the face of temporary difficulties, do not see the bright prospects, do not see the favorable basic aspects, their confidence has wavered, and they are indifferent to the workers' self-sacrifice, not actively improving management; some have not proceeded from "mutual benefit for labor and management," one-sidedly demanding that workers reduce wages, getting an inch and wanting a mile, while they themselves do not try to maintain their businesses, and some even secretly withdraw capital, contributing to the collapse of the enterprise. Obviously, these are extremely wrong. We believe that the industrialists and businessmen currently experiencing difficulties should first recognize the situation, increase confidence, actively manage, explore sales channels in various ways, contribute funds, and maintain their enterprises. As for those industries that are harmful to the national economy and the people's livelihood, such as luxury and superstitious industries, they should be transformed and change their business direction. Secondly, they should improve business management, be meticulous in budgeting, reduce waste, and implement democratic management and labor-management consultation. Major issues should be proactively discussed with workers to obtain their understanding and support. We believe that as long as everyone works together, the difficulties can be overcome."

    提倡建立“双边关系”  劳资协力克服困难
    【新华社天津八日电】天津日报以《劳资协力克服困难》为题，就该市机器染整业劳资双方签订克服困难临时办法协定一事发表评论。评论说：该业工人在目前市场萎缩、农民购买力薄弱、销路停滞的情况下，自愿降低生活待遇，勒紧腰带，忍受一时的苦痛，协同资方，维持生产，这种以个人利益服从整个利益的伟大气魄和自我牺牲的刻己精神，实在令人感动，敬佩！
    评论指出：目前某些私营工业所遇到的困难，是整个人民事业胜利中和进步中的困难，是暂时性的困难，是完全可以克服的。评论说：现在许多工厂的工人已经以自我牺牲的实际行动，表示了自己维护生产的决心。但是，为着克服困难，劳资双方都负有责任。我们认为，大家有理由要求这些企业的主人，老老实实地拿出资本和气力来，把自己的企业维持下来。如果只有工人减低待遇，没有资方的积极经营，那叫做“单边关系”。单边关系是不平等的片面的，任何事情都不可能办好的。我们提倡建立“双边关系”，劳资协力，大家想办法，共同努力，渡过难关。现在已有私营企业的经营者，拿出了克服困难的勇气，增添资本，改善业务，积极维持自己的事业；也有的为工人刻己牺牲的行动所感动，自动公开账目，并设法增加股金，把已经停工的工厂从新开工。这些现象都是好的，值得效法的。但是，也有少数资本家，在一时的困难面前，看不到光明的前景，看不到有利的基本方面，信心发生了动摇，对于工人的刻己牺牲，无动于衷，不积极去改善经营；也有的未从“劳资两利”出发，片面的要求工人减低工资，得寸进尺，而自己不努力想法维持自己的企业，甚至有的暗中抽资，促使企业塌台。显然，这些都是极其错误的。我们认为：目前发生困难的工商业者，应首先认清形势，提高信心，积极经营，多方开拓销路，拿出资金，维持企业。至于那些于国计民生有害无利的行业，如奢侈、迷信行业等，则应进行改造，转变营业方向。其次，应改进经营管理，精打细算，减少浪费，并实行管理民主化劳资协商，重大问题应主动和工人商议，取得工人的谅解和支持。我们相信：只要大家共同努力，困难是一定可以克服的。
