Xinhua News Agency, 29th dispatch: The Philippine Quirino government's atrocities in persecuting our overseas Chinese compatriots are escalating. According to a Central News Agency report from Manila, the acting director of the Philippine Immigration Bureau, Benson, issued a new anti-Chinese order in early April, unreasonably depriving overseas Chinese of their freedom to travel back and forth to their motherland. The order stipulates: (1) Overseas Chinese currently in the Philippines are not allowed to return to the Philippines once they enter mainland China; (2) Overseas Chinese currently in mainland China are not allowed to return to the Philippines; (3) Even overseas Chinese who have previously been granted permission by the Philippine authorities to return to the Philippines will have their entry permits revoked if they have ever entered mainland China.

According to an Agence France-Presse report, personnel from the Philippine National Bureau of Investigation, under the pretext of "suspicion of illegal entry," illegally arrested 28 young overseas Chinese in San Juan, a suburb of Manila, on the 24th.

The Quirino government's atrocities in persecuting overseas Chinese are carried out in collusion with the United States and Kuomintang remnants. According to a Central News Agency report from Manila on the 25th, the propaganda department of the so-called "Asian Anti-Communist League" (an espionage and intelligence organization being prepared by the US, the Philippines, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, according to reports) claimed that the Philippine security authorities had a list of 900 foreigners allegedly "engaged in sabotage" and wanted the league to "help investigate." Most of the names on the list are overseas Chinese. The Philippine Immigration Bureau also requested the police authorities to investigate "all foreigners living in various places," but their real target is overseas Chinese. According to the "Chinese Chamber of Commerce" in Isabela Province, northeast Luzon, the Philippine police authorities in the province have begun to strictly inspect local overseas Chinese and confiscate the immigration certificates of overseas Chinese falsely accused of "engaging in illegal activities," preventing them from traveling to various places, which is actually illegal house arrest.

　　勾结美帝及国民党残匪作恶
    菲反动政府迫害华侨   
    限制我华侨归国并任意拘捕虐待
    【新华社二十九日讯】菲律宾季里诺政府迫害我国侨胞的暴行，正变本加厉。据匪帮中央社马尼拉消息：菲移民局代理局长本生于四月初发布一项新排华的命令，竟无理剥夺华侨往返祖国的自由。该命令规定：（一）目前在菲华侨一旦进入新中国境内，即不准返菲；（二）目前在新中国的华侨，不准返菲；（三）即使前已由菲当局准予返菲的华侨，如曾进入新中国境内者，其入境证就被撤销。
    另据法新社消息：菲全国调查局人员，以“有非法入境嫌疑”为借口，于二十四日在马尼拉郊区圣·朱安非法逮捕华侨青年二十八名。
    季里诺政府迫害华侨的暴行，是与美国及国民党残匪勾结进行的。据匪帮中央社马尼拉二十五日讯：尚未正式成立的所谓“亚洲反共联盟”（按系美、菲及蒋介石匪帮所筹备组织的特务情报机构）宣传部宣称：菲保安当局曾有一项列举九百个所谓“从事破坏”的外国人名单，要该会“帮同查明”，名单中多半是华侨。菲移民局并要求警备当局调查“所有住在各地的外国人”，但其真正的对象是华侨。据吕宋东北的伊萨贝拉省“中华商会”透露：该省菲警备当局已开始严格检查当地华侨，并没收被诬为“从事非法活动”的华侨的移民证，使他们不能再往来各地，实际上就是非法加以软禁。
