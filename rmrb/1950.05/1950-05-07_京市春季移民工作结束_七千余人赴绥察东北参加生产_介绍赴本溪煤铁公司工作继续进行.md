　　Beijing's Spring Immigration Work Concludes
    Over Seven Thousand People Go to Suiyuan and Chahar in Northeast to Participate in Production
    Introduction to Work at Benxi Coal and Iron Company Continues
    [Reported by this newspaper] Beijing's spring immigration work to Suiyuan and Chahar has come to an end; the work of introducing porters and loaders to the Benxi Coal and Iron Company in the Northeast is still in progress. From March 11th to the present, the "Beijing Employment and Production Headquarters" has introduced a total of more than 1,800 households, totaling more than 7,100 people (including more than 1,200 households, more than 4,700 people in Suiyuan Province; 620 households, more than 2,400 people in Chahar Province) to participate in agricultural production in the two provinces of Suiyuan and Chahar. Two batches of people have gone to Benxi in the Northeast, including more than 240 workers and more than 100 family members. A third batch of more than 100 workers are preparing to depart. Most of the immigrants are pedicab workers, followed by poor urban residents, a small number of handcart workers and unemployed intellectuals. Thanks to the enthusiastic help of local governments, farmers, trade unions and fellow workers, these immigrants have settled down and found employment after arriving at their destinations. The provinces of Suiyuan and Chahar prepared houses for the immigrants as early as last winter, distributed five or six mu of good-quality land to each person, as well as some livestock, clothing and furniture. The provinces of Suiyuan and Chahar provided each immigrant with a production subsidy of 560 jin of millet without interest. It is stipulated that it will be paid off in the third year. In this way, the immigrants' food, lodging and production capital were solved in a timely manner. The Benxi Coal and Iron Company has also prepared dormitories for the newly arrived workers. According to individual ability, work with 96 to more than 450 work points is assigned (each work point is approximately equivalent to 2.5 jin of sorghum rice).
    The purpose of this immigration work is mainly to help pedicab workers change careers and solve the living problems of some poor urban residents. Last winter, pedicab workers generally felt that life was difficult due to the cold weather and the small number of passengers. According to a survey in December, 4,000 households and 12,000 people at that time requested the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions to help them change careers. This spring, the People's Government proposed a spring immigration plan at the civil affairs meeting held by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government. In early March, the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, the Labor Bureau, and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions jointly formed the "Beijing Employment and Production Headquarters," and branches were also established in various districts. The headquarters negotiated terms with the provinces of Suiyuan and Chahar and the Benxi Coal and Iron Company. The Municipal Federation of Trade Unions is responsible for mobilization, and the Labor Bureau is responsible for registering workers who go to Benxi for employment. At present, the immigration work in the provinces of Suiyuan and Chahar has ended, except for the work of introducing workers to Benxi, which is still in progress.

　　京市春季移民工作结束
    七千余人赴绥察东北参加生产
    介绍赴本溪煤铁公司工作继续进行
    【本报讯】京市春季移民绥察的工作已告结束；往东北本溪煤铁公司介绍搬运、装卸工人的工作尚继续中。从三月十一日至今，经“北京市介绍就业生产指挥部”介绍到绥、察两省参加农业生产者，共达一千八百余户，七千一百多人（计绥远省一千二百余户，四千七百多人；察哈尔省六百二十户，二千四百多人）。赴东北本溪者已有两批，计工人二百四十多人，家属一百多人。第三批百余工人正整装待发。移民中大多数为三轮车工人，其次为贫苦市民，少数排子车工人和失业知识分子。由于当地政府、农民、工会和工人兄弟的热情帮助，这些移民于到达目的地后，均已安家就业。绥、察两省早于去年冬季即为移民准备了房屋，分给每人五、六亩质量较好的土地，以及部分牲畜、衣服和家具。绥、察两省无利贷给每个移民五百六十斤小米的生产垫本。规定于第三年还清。这样移民的食、宿和生产资本，得以及时解决。本溪煤铁公司也为新去的工人预备了宿舍。按照个人能力，分配给九十六个工分至四百五十余工分的工作（每工分约折合为高粱米二斤十两）。
    此次移民工作的目的，主要是帮助三轮车工人转业，并解决部分贫苦市民的生活问题。去年冬天，三轮车工人曾因天气寒冷、坐客稀少，普遍感到生活困难。据十二月份调查，当时曾有四千户、一万二千人提请市总工会帮助转业。人民政府遂于今春在中央人民政府内务部召开的民政会议上，提出春季移民计划，并于三月初由市民政局、劳动局会同市总工会组成“京市介绍就业生产指挥部”，在各区还设立了分部。由总部与绥、察两省和本溪煤铁公司洽妥条件。由市总工会负责动员，由劳动局负责赴本溪就业工人的登记工作。目前除本溪工人的介绍工作尚在进行外，绥察两省的移民工作已经结束。
