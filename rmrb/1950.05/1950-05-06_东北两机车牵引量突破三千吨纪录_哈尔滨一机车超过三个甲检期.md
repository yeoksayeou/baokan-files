　　Northeast Two Locomotives Break 3,000-Ton Haulage Record
	Harbin Locomotive Exceeds Three Class-A Inspection Periods
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 4th] Two locomotives in Northeast China have created new records by hauling over 3,000 tons.
    The "Father ㄒ 1091" locomotive crew of Li Zhiguo from the Sujiatun Locomotive Depot of the Shenyang Railway Bureau hauled a 3,062-ton freight train from Sujiatun to Lishan Station (near Anshan) on the 19th of last month, traveling 68.4 kilometers in one hour and forty-four minutes of pure transport time (excluding station stop times). This new record exceeds the 2,836-ton record set by the "ㄇ ㄎ 1091" locomotive of the Dalian Locomotive Depot on the 10th of last month, exceeding the railway bureau's stipulated haulage quota of 2,000 tons by more than 50%; the technical speed also exceeded the stipulated standard by 3.8 kilometers and arrived 18 minutes ahead of schedule.
    The "ㄇ ㄎ 11195" "Iron Ox" locomotive team of the Ang'angxi Locomotive Depot of the Qiqihar Railway Bureau hauled 3,010 tons from Anda (between Harbin and Ang'angxi) to Ang'angxi on the 14th of last month. The technical speed en route was 40.1 kilometers, arriving one hour and twenty minutes ahead of schedule and saving 898 kilograms of coal.
    [Xinhua News Agency, 4th] The "Father ㄒ 6576" locomotive of the Sankeshu Locomotive Depot of the Harbin Railway Bureau has traveled 200,000 kilometers as of April 21st, exceeding three Class-A inspection periods (according to Class-A inspection, i.e., major overhaul, the Northeast Railway stipulated last year that freight locomotives undergo a Class-A inspection every 60,000 kilometers). According to preliminary statistics, by extending the three Class-A inspection periods, the locomotive saved more than 156 million Northeast yuan in maintenance costs, 965 kilograms of mixed grease, and 4,800 man-hours. The locomotive was originally a scrapped vehicle, restored and put into operation in April 1948. Piloted by crew members such as Meng Xiangang, it is now one of the "Iron Ox" locomotives in the "Iron Ox" movement of the Northeast Railway.

　　东北两机车牵引量突破三千吨纪录
     哈尔滨一机车超过三个甲检期
    【新华社沈阳四日电】东北两辆机车创造了超过三千吨牵引量的新纪录。
    沈阳铁路局苏家屯机务段“父ㄒ一○九一号”机车李治国乘务组，于上月十九日自苏家屯至立山站（鞍山附近）牵引了三千零六十二吨的重量列车，以一小时四十四分的纯运时间（除去各站停留时间）走行了六十八点四公里。这一新纪录超过上月十日大连机务段“ㄇㄎ一○九一号”机车创造牵引二千八百三十六吨的纪录，超过铁路局规定该机车的牵引定量二千吨的百分之五十以上；技术速度亦超过规定标准三点八公里，并较规定提前十八分到达。
    齐齐哈尔铁路局昂昂溪机务段基干铁牛机车“ㄇㄎ１一一九五号”包车组，于上月十四日自安达（哈尔滨、昂昂溪之间）至昂昂溪，牵引了三千零十吨，途中技术速度为四十点一公里，提前一点二十分到达，并节省了用煤八百九十八公斤。
    【新华社四日讯】哈尔滨铁路局三棵树机务段“父ㄒ６五七六号”机车，截至四月二十一日止，行驶了二十万公里，超过了三个甲检期（按甲检即大检修，东北铁路去年规定货车机车每走行六万公里甲检一次）。据初步统计：该机车由于延长三个甲检期，共节省了检修费东北币一亿五千六百余万元、混合油脂九百六十五公斤，工时四千八百小时。该机车原系废车，于一九四八年四月修复出厂，经乘务员孟宪刚等包乘，现为东北铁路铁牛运动中的铁牛机车之一。
