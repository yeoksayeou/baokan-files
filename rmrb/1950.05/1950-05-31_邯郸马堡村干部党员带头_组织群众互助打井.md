	Cadres and Party Members in Mabao Village, Handan Take the Lead in Organizing the Masses to Help Each Other Dig Wells

	Cadres and Party members in Mabao Village, Second District, Handan County, Hebei Province, have led the masses to organize and dig wells together, completing four wells in twelve days, saving a lot of manpower and materials. The village is a small village with 53 households and 740 mu of land, with 17 old wells. After the branch secretary Ji Youkui attended the Party Member Representative Conference and the village head Wang Tingxiu attended the People's Representative Conference at all levels last year in the ninth month of the lunar calendar, they understood the policy of developing production. In order to develop production, they cooperated with all Party members and cadres to mobilize the masses to dig wells. In order to make the masses fully understand the benefits of well digging, they held a total of seven mass meetings to promote the regulation of "Dry land turns into paddy field, and the burden will not change for three years."

	After the county deployed well-digging work on April 27 this year, village head Wang Tingxiu, branch secretary Ji Youkui, and production committee member Bai Yutang also attended the mobilization meeting in the district. At the meeting, they voluntarily proposed to dig five wells in the village before the wheat harvest. After returning to the village, they held branch meetings, cadre meetings, and mass meetings to deploy and mobilize. In these meetings, they found that some of the masses and individual cadres were afraid of the waste of eating and drinking during well digging as in the past, and some people were afraid that the plots were too small to dig wells. In order to dispel the ideological concerns and practical difficulties of the masses, branch secretary Ji Youkui, Party member Fan Zhenlei, village head Wang Tingxiu, production committee member Bai Yutang, etc., immediately signed up to dig wells, and at the same time persuaded and mobilized the masses separately, and solved various practical difficulties for the masses. For example, Party member Fan Zhenlei mobilized his brothers and three other households, and also mobilized Wang Tinghuai and three other households next to his land to dig a well with him. In the well-digging team of branch secretary Ji Youkui, because Fan Qinghai's family was really in difficulty, 130 jin of coarse grain was lent to him from the public loan grain, which solved his difficulty. Finally, a well was dug. Wang Tingjun and Wang Tingmei's team of seven households had already reached an agreement, but when it came to digging the wellbore, Wang Tingxin suddenly disagreed. Branch secretary Ji Youkui and village head Wang Tingxiu carefully studied his problem. It turned out that the land for digging the well was bought from a landlord in another village before liberation, and he was afraid that it would be taken away by others in the future. Comrades Ji Youkui and others patiently explained to him that after the land reform, anyone with a land certificate could not move his land. Wang Tingxin's ideology was finally opened up.

	In order to save money and avoid waste, the village also held a meeting of well-digging households to jointly study mutual assistance. After discussion, it was stipulated that the well households should dig the dry tube themselves, and go down the well together. Only one public meal is eaten when going down the well, and the rest eat their own. If there is not enough manpower in a well and outsiders are needed, then labor is exchanged for labor. When digging a well, the well households help each other, those who can bail the well bail the well, and those who can fetch water fetch water. Because of their meticulous organization, manpower and materials were greatly saved. For example, Fan Zhenlei's team of seven households and eight laborers helped each other, and the wellbore was dug in one and a half days. Everyone ate their own meals and did not spend a penny. Wang Tingxiu's team of three households and 23 mu of land cost a total of 1,212 jin of millet, which is only 52 jin of millet per mu. The village plans to dig five wells, and four wells have already been dug. The county supply and marketing cooperative has lent the village three pig iron waterwheels.

　　邯郸马堡村干部党员带头
    组织群众互助打井
    河北邯郸县二区马堡村干部党员领导群众组织起来，合伙打井，十二天完成四眼，节省了大量人力物力。该村是个五十三户的小村，全村土地七百四十亩，有老井十七眼。去年阴历九月，支部书记冀有魁参加了党员代表会、村长王廷秀参加了各界人民代表会以后，了解了发展生产的方针，为了发展生产，他们就协同全体党员干部动员群众打井。为了使群众彻底认识打井的好处，他们前后共召开了七次群众会议，宣传“旱田变水田，三年不变负担”的规定。
    今年四月二十七日，全县布置打井工作后，村长王廷秀、支书冀有魁、生产委员白玉堂，又参加了区里的动员大会。在会议上他们自动提出要在麦收前在该村打成五眼井。他们回村后又召开了支部会、干部会、群众会，进行布置及动员。他们在这几个会议中发现有些群众和个别干部怕打井时像过去那样大吃大喝的浪费，有些人怕地块小打不起井。为了解除群众的思想顾虑与实际困难，支书冀有魁、党员樊振雷、村长王廷秀、生产委员白玉堂等，即首先报名打井，同时分头向群众进行说服动员，并为群众解决各种实际困难。如党员樊振雷动员了他亲弟兄等三户，又动员了地邻王廷怀等三户，和他自己合打一眼。在支书冀有魁的打井组里，因为樊清海家庭实在困难，即由公家贷粮中提出一百三十斤粗粮贷给他，解决了他的困难。终于打了一眼。王廷俊、王廷梅组共七户，原来都已谈妥，但到下手挖井筒时，王廷信忽然又不同意了。支书冀有魁和村长王廷秀就仔细研究他的问题，原来他这块打井地是解放前从另一个村的一个地主那里买来的，怕将来被人家抽走。冀有魁等同志就耐心地对他说明土地改革后有了土地证的人，任何人不能动他的地。王廷信的思想终于被打通了。
    为了节约，避免浪费，村里又召开了打井户会议，共同研究互助问题。经大家讨论，规定挖旱筒时本井户自己挖，下井时合伙下。只在下井时吃一顿公饭，其余都是自己吃自己的。如那眼井人力不够，须要用外人时，则以工换工。挖井时，本井户实行互助，能掏井的掏井，能打水的打水。由于他们组织的细密，大大节省了人力与物力。如樊振雷组七户，八个劳力互助，一天半时间挖好了井筒，各人吃各人的饭，一个钱也没花。王廷秀组三户廿三亩地一切在内共花费一千二百一十二斤小米，每亩地才合五十二斤小米。该村计划打五眼井，现已打好四眼。县供销社并已贷给他村三辆生铁水车。
