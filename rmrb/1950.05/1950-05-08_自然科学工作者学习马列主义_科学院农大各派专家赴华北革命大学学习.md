The participants were in high spirits, and they spoke one after another, examining their past ideology and unanimously expressing their determination to transform themselves, abandon old baggage, and better serve the people. Most of those participating in the study this time are research workers who have just arrived from Shanghai and Nanjing, many of whom are well-known experts such as Shen Jiarui, Wu Bao-san, and Liu Dagang.
