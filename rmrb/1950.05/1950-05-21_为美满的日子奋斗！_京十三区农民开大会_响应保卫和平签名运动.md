　　Strive for a Happy Life!
    Farmers in Beijing's Thirteenth District Hold a Congress
    Responding to the Signature Campaign to Defend Peace
    [Our Newspaper's Report] The farmers of the Thirteenth District held a mobilization meeting on the afternoon of the 19th at the Ciyun Temple Village Square in the eastern suburbs to sign in defense of world peace. More than 4,000 people attended. After Chairman Hu Nanqing reported, Chai Zemin, director of the Beijing Municipal Farmers' Association, spoke. He first pointed out: "We need peace, not war." He asked everyone to solemnly recall the pain, poverty, hunger, and death brought about by the wars of the past dozen years. Then he said: "Today, under the leadership of the Communist Party, we have been allocated land and have turned ourselves around. After two or three years of hard work, we will live a happy life. But the imperialists headed by the United States are trying to launch a new war and massacre peaceful residents, so we must unite and show our strength to the enemy! If the U.S. imperialists dare to invade us, they will be given the same blow as they gave Japan. We oppose war, not because we are afraid of war. We must unite in the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union and fight tenaciously to defend world peace." Then, farmer representative Liu Zhenqing, farm woman representative Hu Lijun, young farmer representative Deng Shuchen, student representative Bai Wenhui, and others delivered speeches successively. Liu Dexing, a 64-year-old farmer, raised his fist at the meeting and shouted, "Long live world peace!" Thousands of farmers responded enthusiastically. The farmers who participated in the meeting then scrambled to sign their names. An old woman in her fifties said, "I also want to sign. If the American devils really dare to come, I will risk my old life to fight them!"

　　为美满的日子奋斗！
    京十三区农民开大会         
    响应保卫和平签名运动
    【本报讯】十三区农民前（十九）日午间于东郊慈云寺村广场上举行保卫世界和平签名动员大会，出席四千余人，主席胡楠卿报告后，北京市农会主任柴泽民讲话，他首先指出：“我们需要和平，不需要战争。”他让大家沉痛的回忆过去十几年来战争所带来的痛苦、贫困、饥饿和死亡。接着他说：“今天在共产党的领导下，我们分得了土地，翻了身，经过两三年的努力，我们将要过着美满的日子。但以美国为首的帝国主义者们又在企图发动新的战争，屠杀和平居民，所以我们必须团结起来，对敌人显示我们的力量！如果美帝胆敢向我们侵犯，将要予以如同对日本一样的打击，我们反对战争，并非害怕战争。我们要团结在以苏联为首的和平民主阵营里，为保卫世界和平顽强斗争。”接着由农民代表刘振青、农妇代表胡丽君、青年农民代表邓树臣、学生代表白文辉等先后致辞。六十四岁的老农民刘德兴在大会上举起拳头，高呼世界和平万岁！数千农民发出热烈的回响。参加大会的农民遂即争先恐后签名，一个五十来岁的老大娘说：“我也要签名，如果将来美国鬼子真敢来，我拚出老命也要跟他干！”
