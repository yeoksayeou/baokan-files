　　Improving Work Saves National Wealth
    North China Revolutionary University Commends Model Diligent Personnel

    [Our Newspaper's Report] The North China People's Revolutionary University's School Affairs Office conducted a mass "performance evaluation and model selection" campaign among all service personnel in the school from the end of December last year to February 25th of this year. Through this campaign, work in all areas has been greatly improved; service personnel have made significant progress in their thinking, work style, and learning. A total of seventy-nine model workers of various types were selected (three special-grade, twenty-four first-grade, twenty-seven second-grade, and twenty-five third-grade), of which Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members accounted for approximately 70 percent.

    The gains of this movement are first reflected in saving national wealth. Taking coal burning as an example, previously each person burned an average of 1.5 to 2 *jin* of coal per day, and in some cases as much as 2.5 *jin*. However, due to everyone's active efforts to repair stoves and study and improve techniques, the average has now been reduced to about 1 *jin* per person, and in some cases to 14 *liang*. According to statistics from February 2nd, the entire school now saves 3,285 *jin* of coal per day compared to before the "model selection," saving more than 90,000 *jin* per month. The Second Division has successfully tested an electric bellows, which saves two-thirds of the coal compared to using an exhaust stove every day, and other units are also experimenting with it. Secondly, in the model selection movement, service personnel have achieved great results in welding water buckets, sharpening kitchen knives, repairing steamer baskets, and saving water and electricity. However, the savings of materials and financial resources have not affected the lives of the students and workers, but have further improved them, strengthened kitchen hygiene, and reduced the number of sick people. Service personnel in other positions have also achieved significant results. One car driver saved 18 gallons of gasoline per month and was selected as a special-grade model worker. The political consciousness of the service personnel has also been raised. Some cooks said: "In the past, we wasted a lot of coal because we thought that after burning it, there would be money to buy it, and anyway, the money didn't come from my house." After this model selection, they realized that "burning more coal is wasting people's property," so they took the initiative to improve their work and actively participate in learning. At the same time, more than 30 people have applied to join the Party and the League.

　　改进工作节省国家财富
    华北革大评选模范公勤人员
    【本报讯】华北人民革命大学校务处自去年十二月底至本年二月二十五日，在全校公勤人员中开展了一次群众性的“评功模选”运动。经过这一运动，各方面的工作都有很大改进；公勤人员在思想上、作风上以及学习上均有显著进步。共选出了各种模范工作者七十九人（特等三人、甲等二十四人、乙等二十七人、丙等二十五人），其中共产党员与青年团员约占百分之七十。
    此一运动的收获首先表现在节省国家财富上。只就烧煤来说，以前每人每天平均烧煤斤半至二斤，最多还有二斤半的，但由于大家积极修整炉灶，钻研改进技术，现在做到了平均每人一斤左右，有的减少到十四两。据二月二日统计，全校每日较“评模”以前可省煤三千二百八十五斤，每月即可节省九万余斤；二部并已试用电风箱成功，较用抽风灶每天可省煤三分之二，其他单位有的亦在试行。其次在评模运动中，公勤人员自己焊水桶，磨菜刀，修笼屉，以及节约水电等，均有很大成绩，但并没有因为财物力的节约而影响学工人员的生活，而且使之得到了进一步的改善，并加强了伙房卫生，使病号减少。其他岗位上的公勤人员亦有显著成绩。有一位汽车司机，每月节省了汽油十八加仑，被选为特等模范工作者。公勤人员的政治觉悟也高提了，有的炊事员说：“过去烧煤很浪费，以为烧完有钱买，反正不从我家拿钱。”经过这次评模他们认识了“多烧煤就是浪费人民财产”，所以主动地改进业务，并积极参加学习，同时有三十多人要求入党入团。
