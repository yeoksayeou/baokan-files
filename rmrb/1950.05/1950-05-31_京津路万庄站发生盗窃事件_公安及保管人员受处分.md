　　Theft Incident at Wanzhuang Station on the Beijing-Tianjin Railway
    Public Security and Custodial Personnel Disciplined
    The Wanzhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative Branch in Anci County, Tianjin Special District, Hebei Province, transported 60,000 jin of corn from the Northeast on the evening of May 9th. It began to be transported out at 8:00 a.m. on the 10th, guarded by Qi Wenzhi and Wei Baogang, two cadres from the branch, with Du Yutang and Han Guojun responsible for weighing. That day was the market day in Wanzhuang. More than fifty people from Wanzhuang and nearby villages who came to sweep up spilled grain successively entered the station and approached the grain piles. Due to the irresponsibility of the comrades from the police station and those guarding the grain, the people sweeping up grain began to steal while they swept. Qi Wenzhi did not stop them at the time, merely saying, "Aunties, please stay further away, you are taking too much, I won't be able to account for it." When these people continued to steal, he only covered the grain pile with a mat and then ignored it. Han Guojun immediately raised objections to him, asking him to stop them, but Qi Wenzhi said, "I don't have eyes in the back of my head, I can't manage it." Du Yutang and others held an irresponsible attitude of "only being responsible for weighing, not guarding the grain pile," and did not stop the grain thieves either. Comrades from the Wanzhuang Station Public Security Police Station also failed to stop this illegal theft. As a result, more than 620 jin of grain were stolen in just one day. Afterwards, the station police station also failed to report this to higher authorities.
    After learning about this incident, the Anci County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government immediately sent people to investigate. During the investigation, it was also discovered that theft incidents had been constantly occurring at Wanzhuang Station before.
    After the truth of the matter was clarified, the Anci County People's Government immediately arrested the main thieves and dealt with them according to law. Other people who stole grain were ordered to return the stolen grain and were given criticism and education. In addition to suggesting that the Langfang Station Public Security Resident Office should give Wanzhuang Police Station a disciplinary action, the negligent cadres were also ordered to conduct a strict self-criticism in connection with the previous incident of moldy grain. Qi Wenzhi, Du Yutang, and others were given warnings and demerits respectively.

　　京津路万庄站发生盗窃事件
    公安及保管人员受处分
    河北天津专区安次县万庄供销合作分社于五月九日晚从东北运来玉米六万斤，十日早晨八点起运，由分社干部齐文志、魏保刚二人看守，杜玉堂、韩国俊二人负责过秤。当日正是万庄赶集日子，万庄及附近村子五十余个扫粮食的人，相继进入站内粮堆附近。由于派出所同志及看守粮食者的不负责任，扫粮食的人即一边扫一边偷起来。齐文志当时不加制止，仅仅说：“大娘们，离远点吧，你们弄得太多，我交待不了呀。”当这些人继续偷时，他只用席子盖了盖粮食堆，就不管了。韩国俊当即向他提出意见，要他制止，齐文志却说：“我没长着前后眼，管不了。”而杜玉堂等则抱着“只管过秤，不管看粮堆”的不负责任的态度，对偷粮的人亦未加制止。万庄站公安派出所的同志，对于这种偷窃违法行为亦始终未加以制止。结果仅一天的工夫即被偷去粮食六百二十余斤。事后车站派出所亦未向上级报告。
    安次中共县委和人民政府知道这件事情以后，立即派人前去调查。在调查当中并发现万庄车站内以前亦曾不断发生过偷盗事件。
    事情的真相弄清以后，安次县人民政府即将主要的偷窃犯逮捕，依法处理。对其他偷粮的人则责令将所偷粮食退回，并给予批评教育。对失职干部，除建议廊坊车站公安驻扎所应给万庄派出所以处分外，并令万庄分社联系前次霉坏粮食的事情进行严格检讨。对齐文志、杜玉堂等人分别给予警告和记过处分。
