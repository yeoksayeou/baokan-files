　　Oppose Pedestrians Trampling Fields
　　To the Editors:
　　I am a soldier in the Fourth Field Army. I have traveled extensively in Henan and have seen a phenomenon that wastes land and reduces the country's grain income.
　　Everywhere in Henan, one can see people taking shortcuts across cultivated fields, saving themselves a few steps. Sometimes even carts follow these diagonal paths, making them as wide as one and a half meters. Landowners try various methods to stop this, but none are effective. In addition, on every major road I traveled in Henan, I saw the edges of the fields being trampled, rendering more than half a meter of land along both sides of the road unproductive. I think this phenomenon must occur not only in Henan, as there are many drylands in the north. The amount of land wasted in this way must be very large. The loss of grain is incalculable. Therefore, I am writing to tell you this, and I ask you to study how to overcome this huge waste and loss in our country.

### 反对行人践踏田地

　　反对行人践踏田地编辑同志：
    我是第四野战军部队的一个战士。我在河南曾走过很多路，看到一个浪费土地，减少全国粮食收入的现象。
    在河南到处都可以看到因为行路的人贪图省走几步，就在已耕种的田地里抄斜走过，有时连大车也跟着从斜道通过，这就使这种斜道宽到一公尺半左右。田地主人用种种办法阻挡都不见有效。另外，我在河南走过的每条大道上都看见有踏地边的现象，使大道两旁半公尺以上的田地不能好好收获。我想在北方旱田地很多，这种现象一定不仅是在河南发生。因为这样浪费掉的土地一定是非常多的。损失的粮食真是没法计算。因此，我要写信告诉你们，请你们研究如何才能克服我们国家这笔巨大的浪费与损失。
