　　It wasn't until the "August 15th" cannons roared,
　　That the Northeast longed for the Communist Party;
　　The landlords' prestige was completely overthrown,
　　And the poor split the land and divided the houses.

　　On "August 15th," the Japanese bandits surrendered,
　　The Northeast longed for the Communist Party;
　　Chiang's bandits came again to fight a civil war,
　　With America acting out a double act behind the scenes.

　　All because Chiang's bandits came to attack,
　　Chiang's bandits and the landlords were a gang;
　　Everyone protected the fruits of liberation,
　　I voluntarily joined the army and went to the front.

　　Three campaigns south of the Yangtze in mobile warfare,
　　Climbing on ice and sleeping in snow was truly glorious;
　　In the great battle of Jinzhou, I took the lead,
　　Determined to enter the customs and fight.

    凯旋忆当年（五）
    西虹词  西野画
    直到“八一五”大炮响，
    东北盼来了共产党；
    地主的威风全打倒，
    穷人劈地又分房。
    “八一五”日寇投了降，
    东北盼来了共产党；
    蒋匪又来打内战，
    美国在后面演双簧。
    皆因蒋匪来进攻，
    蒋匪地主是一帮；
    翻身果实大家保，
    我自动参军上前方。
    三下江南运动战，
    爬冰卧雪真光荣；
    大战锦州我当先，
    进关作战决心强。
