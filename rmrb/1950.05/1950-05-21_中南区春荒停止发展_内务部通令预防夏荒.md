Xinhua News Agency, Hankou, 18th: The spring famine in the Central South region has ceased to develop after the People's Government issued a large number of loans and organized disaster-stricken people to help themselves through production. In addition, the wheat harvest is approaching, and the disaster-stricken people in various places have full confidence in safely overcoming the spring famine.

During the spring famine in March and April this year, the Central South Military and Political Committee and the People's Government promptly issued 890 million catties of loan grain and 310 million yuan in Renminbi to help disaster-stricken people tide over the famine through production. At the same time, governments at all levels also dispatched a large number of cadres to go deep into the disaster areas to check the issuance of loans and specifically organize and lead the disaster-stricken people to carry out production for self-relief. At present, 5 million disaster-stricken people in the region have obtained two to five months of rations by participating in sideline production and river management projects. For example, more than 500,000 disaster-stricken people in 11 counties along Dongting Lake in Hunan Province and the Mianyang Special District of Hubei have participated in dike repair projects, and the wages and food they have earned can solve the living problems of more than 1.2 million people for two to four months. In Henan Province, more than 1.2 million people have also solved their living problems by participating in ditch digging and dike repair. In order to solve the problem of sales of sideline products of disaster-stricken people, the Trade Department of the Hunan Provincial People's Government allocated 10 billion yuan to purchase a large quantity of local products. The Zhuhe Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Jianli County, Hubei Province, purchased textiles from disaster-stricken people in exchange for grain, which can solve the five-month ration problem for disaster-stricken people in nine villages. Organs and troops in various parts of the Central South region donated a large amount of grain from production savings, which also solved the living difficulties of many disaster-stricken people.

Through the above efforts, the spring famine in the Central South region stopped developing at the end of April. At present, wheat is about to be harvested throughout the region. In order to provide emergency relief to some of the disaster-stricken people who are about to run out of food, the Central South Military and Political Committee quickly distributed 100 million catties of grain additionally allocated by the Central People's Government to the disaster-stricken people in early May. After receiving relief grain, the disaster-stricken people in various places, seeing that a good wheat harvest is expected, have further strengthened their confidence in overcoming the spring famine.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th: The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Central People's Government issued a circular to the people's governments of all provinces, stating that after the spring famine has passed, they should not relax or become paralyzed about the disaster, and should immediately pay attention to preventing the summer famine and prepare to lead the people in fighting against the summer famine. The circular pointed out that all areas with a weak rural foundation and those with less wheat planting or a poor wheat harvest should prepare to fight against the summer famine. Any relaxation or paralysis is not allowed. Cadres at all levels of government should continue to go deep into the countryside to help farmers make careful calculations and organize farmers to produce and tide over the famine, try to invigorate rural borrowing and mutual assistance, stop farmers from eating green (unripe wheat) before the wheat harvest, and after the wheat harvest, call on farmers to be thrifty, mix in coarse grains and substitutes, and mobilize farmers to plant more melons, vegetables and other early-maturing crops.

　　中南区春荒停止发展
    内务部通令预防夏荒
    【新华社汉口十八日电】中南地区的春荒，经过人民政府发放大批贷粮和组织灾民生产自救以后，现已停止发展。加之麦收将届，各地灾民对安渡春荒具有充分信心。
    今年三、四两月春荒时期，中南区人民政府及时发放贷粮八亿九千万斤，人民币三亿一千万元，帮助灾民生产渡荒。同时，各级人民政府并派遣大批干部，深入灾区，检查贷款发放情形，并具体组织和领导灾民进行生产自救。目前全区已有五百万灾民由于参加副业生产和治河工程，而获得了两个月至五个月的口粮。如湖南省洞庭湖沿岸十一县和湖北沔阳专区五十多万灾民，参加修堤工程，所得工资粮可以解决一百二十多万人两个月至四个月的生活问题。河南省也有一百二十多万人由于参加挖沟修堤而解决了生活问题。湖南省人民政府贸易处为解决灾民副业产品销路问题，曾拨发一百亿元大量收购土产。湖北监利县朱河镇供销合作社收购灾民纺织品，换回粮食，可解决九个村的灾民五个月的口粮。中南区各地机关、部队从生产节约中捐献大批粮食，也解决了许多灾民的生活困难。
    经过上述努力，中南区春荒四月底即停止发展。目前全区小麦即将收割，中南军政委员会为急救一部分将要断炊的灾民，又将中央人民政府增拨的一亿斤粮食于五月初迅速发放给灾民。各地灾民获得救济粮后，又看到小麦丰收有望，更加增强了渡过春荒的信心。
    【新华社十九日讯】中央人民政府内务部通令各省人民政府于春荒过去后不应对灾荒松懈麻痹，应即注意预防夏荒，和准备领导人民与夏荒作斗争。通令指出：凡农村底子太薄以及种麦较少或麦收不好的地区，均应准备和夏荒作斗争。任何放松麻痹都是不能容许的。各级政府干部应继续深入农村，帮助农民精打细算和组织农民生产渡荒，设法活跃农村的借贷互助，麦收前应停止农民吃青（不成熟的麦子）现象，麦收后应号召农民节约，掺吃粗粮和代食品，发动农民多种瓜菜等早熟作物。
