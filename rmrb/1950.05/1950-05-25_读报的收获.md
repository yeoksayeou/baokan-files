　　The Gains from Reading the Newspaper
    (I) To the Editor:
    On May 1st, our newspaper reading group was busy holding a meeting when we suddenly received the People's Daily sent from Beijing, and the comrades were very happy. So, the meeting was temporarily suspended for newspaper reading. When we read the article published in the People's Garden, "Individual Soldiers Violate Discipline, Relevant Units Apologize to the Masses and Compensate," every comrade was moved. In the afternoon of the same day, we held a meeting for self-examination. At the meeting, everyone seriously carried out criticism and self-criticism.
    Comrade Yuan Shiwu said: "I took a piece of clothing, socks, and a pair of insoles from the common people in the Eighth Village, and I didn't pay for the shoes I had made." Comrade Lin Chengxun confessed: I hit an old乡 (villager/fellow countryman) once and cursed twice. In addition, some things obtained by violating mass discipline were found. After the meeting, we returned all the things obtained by violating discipline to the old乡 (villagers/fellow countrymen) and apologized to them. Everyone is determined to thoroughly transform themselves in the future and be models of abiding by discipline.
    This is the achievement we have gained after reading the People's Daily for the first time.

    (II) Dear Editor:
    The newspaper reading group of the Inspection and Sealing Section of the People's Printing Factory began reading the People's Daily on May 10th. In this short period of time, we have gained a lot of knowledge.
    On the 15th, we saw the World Peace Council's Peace Appeal and the signature campaign launched by the capital's rally, and we enthusiastically prepared to join this signature campaign. However, at that time, there was no signature place in our factory; because of work, we could not personally go to the place set up by your newspaper to sign. On the 16th, we saw the announcement in your newspaper, so we immediately gathered everyone at noon on the same day to start the signature campaign. Under our call, more than fifty comrades in our factory have participated in the signature.
    We have read Foreign Minister Zhou's statement. This not only aroused our anger at MacArthur, but also made us more clearly understand the conspiracy of American imperialism. We have launched a heated discussion and decided to use our voices to oppose this illegal and ultra vires act that damages the basic rights and interests of the Chinese people. The "Party Life Column" is one of the places we value most. Combined with the current ideological investigation in our People's Printing Factory, Comrade Wang Lifu's self-criticism has deepened our ideological investigation. After studying the relationship between the Party and the masses in the Dalian Transportation Company Tram Factory, we gained experience in how to contact the masses and further realized that doing a good job in the relationship between the Party and the masses is the main factor in doing a good job in production work. We request that your newspaper further reflect the life of the Party to the broad masses of the people.

　　读报的收获
    （一）编辑同志：
    五月一日，我们的读报小组正在忙着开会的时候，忽然接到了从北京寄来的人民日报，同志们都很高兴。于是，会议暂时停了下来，进行读报。当我们读到在人民园地上发表的《个别战士违反纪律，有关部队向群众道歉赔偿》这篇文章时，每个同志都受到了感动。在当天下午召开会议进行了自我检查，会上，每个人都严肃地展开了批评与自我批评。
    袁士五同志说：“我在第八村拿了老百姓衣服一件、袜子和鞋底各一双，做鞋也不给钱。”林成勋同志检讨：打过老乡一回，骂人两回。此外，还查出了一些违犯群众纪律得来的东西。会后，我们将一切违犯纪律得来的东西全部送还给了老乡，并向他们道歉。大家决心在今后彻底改造自己，作遵守纪律的模范。
    这是我们第一次读了人民日报以后所获得的成绩。

    （二）亲爱的编辑同志：
    人民印刷厂检封科读报小组从五月十日开始看人民日报。在这很短的时间内，我们得到了不少知识。
    我们在十五日看到世界和大常委会和平呼吁书，及首都集会发起的签名运动，便热情地准备投入这一签名运动。但当时，本厂并无签名处；因为工作的关系也不能亲身到贵报所设立的地方去签名。在十六日报上看到贵报的启事，于是我们在当日中午即召集大家展开签名运动。在我们的号召下，本厂已有五十余位同志参加了签名。
    我们读过了周外长发表的声明。这不仅激起了我们对麦克阿瑟的愤恨，而且使我们更清楚地认识了美帝国主义的阴谋。我们已展开热烈的讨论，决定要用我们的呼声来反对这种损害中国人民基本权益的违法越权行为。《党的生活栏》是我们最重视的地方之一。结合着目前我们人民印刷厂的查思想，王笠夫同志的自我检讨使我们在思想检讨中更深入了一步。学习了大连交通公司电车工厂党群关系之后，我们得到了怎样联系群众的经验，更深一步认识到搞好党与群众的关系是搞好生产工作的主要因素。我们要求贵报能更进一步地把党的生活反映到广大群众中去。
