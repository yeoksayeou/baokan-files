　　Grain Company Strives to Adjust
    Shanghai's Rice Supply Fully Guaranteed
    Current Grain Reserves are Sufficient to Maintain Stable Grain Prices
    [Our Shanghai News] Special Correspondent Zhou Ziqin reports: The rice supply for Shanghai's five million people has been fully guaranteed through the efforts of the National Grain Company. Since the Spring Festival this year, rice has played a significant role in stabilizing prices.
    The people of Shanghai will not forget that before liberation, the "grain shortage" in Shanghai followed them like a ghostly shadow. Due to the long-term anti-people policies of the Kuomintang bandit gang and their dependence on imperialism, Shanghai's rice supply was in a state of serious crisis for a long time. In the past, the only way the Kuomintang bandit gang dealt with the crisis was to place their hopes on the import of grain from American imperialism and other countries. Taking the years 1946 to 1948 as an example, the total amount of rice imported into Shanghai was: 4,069,220 piculs in 1946, 7,086,739 piculs in 1947, and 5,521,504 piculs in 1948. The proportion of foreign rice imports was: 48.23 percent in 1946, 93.39 percent in 1947, and 99.74 percent in 1948. The proportion of foreign rice imports in Shanghai accounted for as high as 99.74 percent of the total in the country. Therefore, since 1946, foreign rice has almost completely controlled the Shanghai market. In order to solve the rice problem in Shanghai, the Kuomintang bandit gang adopted measures such as price limits, rationing based on population, allocations, and inventory checks. However, the Kuomintang bandit gang was checking inventories with one hand while engaging in speculation and hoarding with the other, so the more they "checked," the more serious the hoarding became, and the more the "price limits" were limited, the higher the prices went. Grain became a barometer of price fluctuations, and often when the price of rice rose, the price of all other goods also soared, to the point of being uncontrollable.
    After the liberation of Shanghai, the People's Government, under the principle of self-reliance and reliance on the people, vigorously solved the problem of rice supply in Shanghai. The following principles were established: 1. Intensify urban-rural exchanges, dredge the sources of grain, and try to exchange industrial products for grain as much as possible, followed by cash purchases; 2. Reward free trade, manage storage and transportation, and entrust processing; 3. Control materials, regulate supply and demand, and plan the intake and output of materials according to the interests of production, transportation, and sales, and control prices; 4. Operate as an enterprise, streamline and save; 5. Guarantee the lives of public employees and teachers and implement key allocations. The Shanghai Grain Company also carried out a series of tasks: First, the purchase work in other areas: such as transshipment from the Northeast; direct purchase from Jiangxi; concluding entrusted purchase contracts with southern Anhui, northern Anhui, and southern Jiangsu; and carrying out partial grain allocation, etc. In terms of grain transportation, a motor transport team (with fourteen vehicles) was established, grain transfer stations were set up, and specially contracted rice flour processing plants were organized, effectively ensuring the smooth progress of Shanghai's grain supply.
    In the implementation of price policy, three prices were adopted: 1. Market selling price, 2. Retail price of business outlets, specially contracted rice stores and retail stores, increasing 5,000 yuan based on the market price; 3. Allocation and cooperative sales price, 5% discount on the market price. Taking the market price on February 21st as an example: the market price of medium white japonica rice was 270,000 yuan per picul, the retail price was 275,000 yuan, and the allocation and cooperative sales price was 256,500 yuan. The roles of these three prices: the first price of rice sold in the first half of February accounted for 56%, the purpose is to stabilize market prices; the second price is to reduce the intermediate exploitation of poor citizens by private rice stores, and to give private merchants a reasonable profit for resale; the third price is to give preferential treatment to public employees and teachers. In rice sales, mainly through private merchants and business outlets, retail stores, cooperatives, allocations, etc., and private merchants' sales include both specially contracted rice stores and market sales. When market prices fluctuate, sales are stepped up, reaching 600,000 to 700,000 piculs per month. For example, after the Spring Festival this year, grain prices rose slightly, and the retail price at that time was 307,000 yuan per picul, and the Shanghai Grain Company immediately sold a large amount of medium white japonica rice at a price of 270,000 yuan per picul. It played a great role in supplying the market with rice and stabilizing prices. When the price of rice fell, it was appropriately bought in to stabilize the price of rice at a certain level. For example, in the half month from February 21st to March 9th this year, the Shanghai Grain Company accounted for a maximum of 99% of the total market sales, and almost all of Shanghai's citizens were supplied with rice by the Shanghai Grain Company. As a result of the large-scale sales, citizens' grain purchases reached saturation, and on March 8th, it gradually dropped to 21%. Among the grain sold, the resale by private merchants was in the first place, and it was not until later that state-owned retail stores gradually developed and expanded that the proportion of resale stores gradually decreased, from the highest daily transaction volume of 90% to 36% on March 8th. In terms of the total market transaction volume, the Shanghai Grain Company increased from the lowest point of 24% to the highest point of 54.5%. Therefore, the position of the Shanghai Grain Company in the market was rapidly improved.
    On April 1st, after the official establishment of the Shanghai Retail Company, it completed the task of establishing 50 retail stores, with an average daily sale of more than 10,000 piculs of grain, accounting for 60% of the total sales in Shanghai. On the 12th, it also began to establish door-to-door sales business, with daily door-to-door sales of 300 to 400 piculs, sometimes as high as more than 1,000 piculs a day. From April 1st to 20th, the total amount of grain sold by the Retail Company was 200,000 piculs, and the total amount of currency recovered was 51.7 billion yuan, achieving great results in solving the food problem of the entire city. At present, Shanghai has sufficient grain reserves, and stable grain prices can be maintained.

    上海食米获充分保证           
    目前存粮充足粮价可以保持平稳
    【本报上海讯】特派记者周子芹报道：上海市五百万人民的食米供应，经过国家粮食公司的努力调剂，已经得到充分的保证。今年春节以后，食米在稳定物价中所起的作用，更是十分巨大。
    上海人民不会忘记，解放以前，上海的“粮荒”像魔影似地在自己的身边跟随着。由于国民党匪帮长期反人民的政策及依附于帝国主义，上海食米供应长期处在严重的危机中。过去国民党匪帮对付危机的唯一办法，就是把希望寄托在美帝国主义和其他国家输入粮食上。以一九四六年到一九四八年为例，上海食米输入总数：一九四六年为四、○六九、二二○石，一九四七年为七、○八六、七三九石，一九四八年为五、五二一、五○四石。其中洋米输入的比例：一九四六年为百分之四八·二三，一九四七年为百分之九三·三九，一九四八年为百分之九九·七四。上海洋米输入在全国所占的比重上，最高时达到百分之九九·七四。因此，从一九四六年以来，洋米几乎全部控制了上海的市场。为了解决上海的食米问题，国民党匪帮曾采取了限价、计口售粮、配给、查库等办法。但，国民党匪帮是左手查库，右手就在干投机囤积的勾当，所以越“查”、囤积就越严重，“限价”也是越限越高。粮食就成了物价大波动的寒暑表，往往米价一涨，百货亦随之飞涨，以至不可收拾。
    上海解放之后，人民政府在自力更生、依靠人民的方针下，大力解决上海的食米供应问题。确定了如下几个原则：一、加紧城乡交流，疏通粮源，尽量设法以工业品交换粮食，其次才照现款收购；二、奖励自由贸易，管理储运，委托加工；三、掌握物资，调剂供求，根据产、运、销利益，有计划吞吐物资，掌握价格；四、经营企业化，精简节约；五、保障公教人员生活，实行重点配给。上海粮食公司并进行了一系列的工作：首先是外埠采购工作：如从东北转运；从江西直接采购；同皖南、皖北、苏南等地订立委购合同；进行部分粮食调拨等等。在粮食运输上，建立汽车运输队（有十四辆汽车），设立粮食转运站，组织特约米粉加工厂等等，有效的保证了上海粮食供应的顺利进行。
    在执行价格政策上，采取了三种价格：一、市场抛售价格，二、营业所、特约米店及门市部的零售价格，照市价增加五千元；三、配售及合作社代售价格，按市价打九五折。以二月二十一日市场价格为例：中白粳每石市场价格二十七万元，零售则为二十七万五千元，如按配售及合作社代售则为二十五万六千五百元。这三种价格的作用：第一种价格抛售的食米，二月份上半月达百分之五十六，目的在于稳定市场物价；第二种价格则在于减轻私营米店对贫苦市民的中间剥削，并使私商代销得到适当的利润；第三种价格则为对公教人员的差别待遇。在食米销售上，主要是经由私商和营业所、门市部、合作社、配售等方面，而私商出售则包括特约米店和市场抛售两方面。在市场物价波动时，就加紧抛售，每月达六七十万石。如今年春节以后，粮食略有上升，当时零售价每石三十万零七千元，而上海粮食公司即以每石售价二十七万元，大量抛售中白粳。在尽量供给市场食米、稳定价格上，起了很大作用。到米价跌落时，又适当买进，使米价在一定水准上稳定下来。如从今年二月二十一日到三月九日半个月中，上海粮食公司在整个市场抛售中，最高达百分之九十九，几乎全上海市民食米都由上海粮食公司所供给。由于大量抛售的结果，市民购粮已达饱和状态，在三月八日才逐渐下降到百分之二十一。在抛售出去的粮食中，又以委托私商代销居于首位，直到后来国营零销店逐渐发展和扩大，代销店才逐步下降，由每日最高成交量百分之九十下降到三月八日的百分之三十六。在市场总成交量方面，上海粮食公司则由最低时的百分之二十四，增加到最高时的百分之五四·五。因而迅速提高了上海粮食公司在市场上的地位。
    四月一日，上海零售公司正式成立后，完成了建立五十家零销店的任务，平均每天售粮在一万石以上，达全上海总销售量百分之六十。十二日并开始建立门售业务，每天门售达三四百石，有时一天高达一千余石。从四月一日到二十日，经零售公司出售粮食总量共二十万石，通货回笼共五百一十七亿元，在解决全市民食上，获得了很大的成绩。目前上海存粮充足，粮价平稳当能保持下去。
