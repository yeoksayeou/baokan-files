　　Zhengzhou Railway Bureau Launches Punctuality Competition
　　Luoyang-Shaanxi Area Wins Red Banner
    [Our Zhengzhou Dispatch] The train punctuality campaign, launched by the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau on March 15th, has achieved great success. After democratic evaluation by various sections, the Luoyang-Shaanxi area surpassed its target in the first period (March 15th to April 15th), achieving a punctuality rate of 91.1%, and won the championship. The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau organized representatives to deliver the banner and awards to the Luoyang-Shaanxi area. Employees of the Luoyang-Shaanxi section also held a grand Red Banner welcoming ceremony.
    It is understood that the Luoyang-Shaanxi area has the steepest gradients, the most curves, and the worst equipment, which presents many difficulties. During the punctuality campaign, the employees of this section demonstrated a high degree of class consciousness. In the past, the stopping time in Shaanxi Prefecture was 78 minutes; now, coal and water are no longer loaded in Shaanxi Prefecture, and the stopping time has been drastically reduced to 3 minutes. Employees throughout the section united closely in the campaign, with close coordination between train and engine crews, and exemplary locomotives and individuals emerged, such as No. 666 (the first locomotive to successfully experiment with not loading coal and water in Shaanxi Prefecture), Nos. 705, 719, and 997.

　　郑州路局发动正点竞赛运动
　　洛陕地区夺得红旗
    【本报郑州讯】郑州路局于三月十五日发动的列车正点运行循环红旗竞赛运动，已获得很大成绩。经各段民主评定结果，洛陕地区于第一期（三月十五日到四月十五日）超过任务，完成百分之九十一点一的正点成绩，荣获冠军。郑州路局组织代表往洛陕地区送旗送奖。洛陕段员工并举行了盛大的欢迎红旗大会。
    按洛陕地区线路坡度最大，湾道最多，设备又差，困难是很多的。在正点运动中，该段员工表现了高度的阶级觉悟。过去在陕州停车时间为七十八分钟，现在作到不在陕州上煤上水，停车时间骤减到三分钟。全段员工在运动中亲密团结，车、机密切连系，涌现出六六六号（最初试验在陕州不上煤水成功的机车）、七零五、七一九、九九七号等典型机车及人物。（沈志）
