Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 25th. The speed and scale of industrial construction in Northeast China this year will greatly exceed any previous period. The Northeast People's Government is investing a huge amount of funds, accounting for about 40% of the year's fiscal expenditure, in industrial construction this year, and using 85% of these funds for the restoration and new construction of heavy industry. According to this year's restoration and construction plan, the capacity of major industrial equipment in Northeast China by the end of this year will greatly exceed the level at the end of last year. Among them, the capacity of iron smelting furnaces can be increased to 205%; the capacity of copper smelting furnaces can be increased to 250%; the capacity of motor manufacturing can be increased to 350%; the capacity of machine tools can be increased to 143%; the capacity of paper making machines can be increased to 197%; the capacity of cotton spindles can be increased to 166%, and the capacity of looms can be increased to 154%.

Last year, while the Northeast People's Government had a relatively difficult financial situation and was burdened with the task of supporting the national liberation war, it invested funds equivalent to 2 million tons of sorghum in industrial restoration and construction. As a result, the restoration and construction of industry in Northeast China took shape on a preliminary scale last year, and the total industrial output value reached 35% of the total industrial and agricultural output value.

In the first quarter of this year, the Northeast Industrial Department has correctly allocated national investment in accordance with the needs and possible conditions of various major light and heavy industrial institutions and economic construction, and formulated construction project plans for major industries. Large-scale construction projects have now been launched.

　　东北今年工业建设投资占财政支出百分之四十
    【新华社沈阳二十五日电】今年东北工业建设进展的速度及其规模将大大超过以往任何时期。东北人民政府今年以占全年财政支出百分之四十左右的巨额资金投入工业建设，并以其中百分之八十五的资金，作为恢复与新建重工业之用。根据今年的恢复修建计划，今年年底东北各主要工业设备的能力将大大超过去年年底的水平。其中炼铁炉能力可增到百分之二百零五；铜矿熔炉能力可增到百分之二百五十；电机制造能力可增到百分之三百五十；机械母机可增到百分之一百四十三；纸张抄造机可增到百分之一百九十七；棉纺锭可增到百分之一百六十六，织布机可增到百分之一百五十四。
    去年，东北人民政府在财政情况比较困难同时又担负着支援全国解放战争的任务的条件下，曾以相当于二百万吨高粱的资金投入工业恢复建设，结果使去年东北工业的恢复与建设粗具规模，工业生产总值达到工农业生产总值百分之三十五的水平。
    今年第一季中，东北工业部已按照各主要轻重工业机构及经济建设的需要和可能条件，把国家投资作了正确的分配，并制订出各主要工业的修建工程计划。现大规模的修建工程已告展开。
