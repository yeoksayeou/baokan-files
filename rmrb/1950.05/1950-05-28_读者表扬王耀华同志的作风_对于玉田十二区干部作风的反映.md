　　Readers Praise Comrade Wang Yaohua's Work Style
    Reflections on the Work Style of Cadres in Yutian's Twelfth District

Comrades of the Yutian County Twelfth District Government:

    Your work has demonstrated a high degree of dedication to serving the people, which has given me a profound understanding of the People's Government. Your work ethic is worthy of emulation by cadres in all districts. I would particularly like to commend Comrade Wang Yaohua. Although he has only been working in our district for half a year, he has already made a significant contribution to the masses. Before the spring wheat planting, he spent all day in the villages mobilizing everyone to plant wheat. When it came to lending wheat seeds, he was busy in the district all day long, lending wheat seeds to everyone, never relaxing for a moment, not even taking time to eat, for fear of delaying everyone's wheat planting. When people from some villages didn't come to borrow wheat seeds, he sent messages to them repeatedly, urging them to come back, and always telling them, "There's a deadline for planting wheat; if you're late, you won't be able to plant it. If you plant more wheat this spring, everyone's life won't be difficult after the wheat harvest." Now the wheat seedlings in our district are particularly good, and the wheat harvest will surely be abundant, and the acreage planted is so large, on average, each family has planted two-thirds more than last year. We cannot but thank the efforts of the cadres.

    Some time ago, the Yuan Zizhao family of the Minquan Street villagers in the city had a dispute over a house. The village cadres said, "This house was voluntarily dedicated to everyone by the owner long ago." But the owner said, "This house was never dedicated." I also felt that forcing people to dedicate their houses was not in line with the policies of the People's Government. Later, the owner's family asked the district government to resolve the matter. Comrade Wang Yaohua took charge of the investigation and research, discussed it with the Civil Affairs Section of the county, and convened a cadre meeting. After everyone's discussion and approval, the house was returned to the original owner.

    Comrade Wang Yaohua can grasp principles, analyze problems comprehensively, and never separate himself from the masses. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party can such cadres be produced.

    Finally, I would like to make a suggestion to the comrades of the district government, which is to frequently encourage the masses to report their opinions to the higher authorities. At the same time, constantly check the work of the village cadres and help them make political progress. As I understand it, the masses have opinions about the village cadres, but many of them dare not express them; they just complain and grumble behind their backs. This is very bad. I request the government to strengthen the political education of village cadres so that they can correct their shortcomings in their work.

                                   Zhi Hua, Chengnan Village, Yutian

　　读者表扬王耀华同志的作风
    对于玉田十二区干部作风的反映玉田县十二区政府同志们：
    你们在工作中表现了高度的为人民服务的精神，使我对人民政府有了深刻的认识。你们的工作精神，是值得各区的干部同志们学习的。我在这里特别要表扬王耀华同志。他来本区工作的时间虽仅半年，但对于群众已有很大的贡献。在今春种麦以前，他整天下乡发动各村种麦。贷放麦种的时候，他就整天在区里忙着给大家贷麦种，一分一秒钟也不肯放松工作，忙得连饭都顾不得吃，只怕耽误大家的种麦。有的村子没见到贷麦种的人，他就三番五次的捎信叫他们回来，并且总是告诉他们说：“种麦是有时间性的，晚一点就种不上了。今春多种点麦，麦秋以后大家的生活就不会发生困难了。”现在本区麦苗特别好，麦秋一定丰收，而且种的亩数这样多，平均每家比去年多种三分之二。这不能不感谢干部同志的努力。
    前些日子，城内村民权街袁子昭家为了房子问题闹纠纷。村干部说：“这房子早就经房主自愿献给大家了”。但是房主说：“这房子根本就没有献出去。”我听了也觉得强迫人家献房子是不合人民政府政策的。后来房主家请区政府解决，经王耀华同志负责进行调查研究，又同县里民政科讨论，并召集干部会议，经大家讨论通过，将房子仍归原主。
    王耀华同志能掌握原则，从全面分析问题，处处不脱离群众。只有在共产党领导下才能产生这样的干部。
    最后，我要向区政府的同志们提出一点意见，就是要经常启发群众向上级反映意见。同时要不断的检查村干部们的工作，帮助他们在政治上进步。据我了解，群众对村干部是有意见的，但是他们有好多人不敢提，只是背后诉苦发牢骚。这是很不好的。我要求政府加强对村干部的政治教育，使他们能够在工作中改正自己缺点。
