Notice of This Newspaper's Launch of a Signature Campaign for Peace

All Readers of This Newspaper Should Widely Launch a Mass Signature Campaign

In enthusiastic response to the call of the World Peace Congress Standing Committee and the Chinese Committee for the Defense of World Peace, this newspaper is launching a peace signature campaign for its readers. It is hoped that readers in all regions, especially the newspaper's correspondents and reading groups, will mobilize the broad masses of the people to enthusiastically sign the appeal of the World Peace Congress Standing Committee. In addition to the signature location at No. 117 Wangfujing Street in Beijing, most readers can use the method of signing by mail. Simply state "Peace Signature" and write your name, occupation, and mailing address in the letter. Many names can be signed in one letter. With the consent of illiterate workers and peasants, they can be signed on their behalf, but the name of the person signing on their behalf must be added. When submitting signed peace appeals to this newspaper, please indicate "Peace Signature" and cut open the left corner of the envelope to avoid postage. Please send the signed letters before the 31st of this month. Remote areas may extend the deadline to before the 15th of June. Send letters to the Peace Signature Office, People's Daily, Beijing.

Attached: Peace Appeal

We demand: The unconditional prohibition of atomic weapons for use as tools of mass destruction against the people. And the establishment of strict international control to ensure the execution of this decision.

We believe: Any government that first uses atomic weapons against any other country is a war criminal.

We call on the people of the world to sign this appeal.

Signatory:
