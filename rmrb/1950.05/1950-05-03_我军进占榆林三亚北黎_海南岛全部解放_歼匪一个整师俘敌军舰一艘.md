Xinhua News Agency, Hainan Front, 2nd: The People's Liberation Army on the Hainan front liberated Yulin, the largest port in southern Hainan, Sanya, and the key port of Beili in western Hainan on April 30th, annihilating an entire enemy division, victoriously concluding the Hainan Island liberation campaign. After the People's Liberation Army defeated the last desperate struggle of the remaining enemy forces in northern Hainan and occupied Haikou and Wenchang, ending the first stage of operations, it advanced rapidly south in two directions. The rapid deployment units of the Eastern Route PLA, advancing south along the island ring road, defeated all desperate resistance attempts by the remaining enemy forces along the way and victoriously occupied Yulin and Sanya at 4:00 PM on April 30th, gaining control of Sanya Airport, the largest enemy air force base in southern Hainan. The Western Route PLA captured the key port of Beili in western Hainan at 12:00 AM on April 30th. During the offensive, our army annihilated the entire 86th Division of the enemy's 4th Army near Beili and captured an enemy warship that had not escaped in the port of Beili. Thus, from April 17th, when the People's Liberation Army successfully landed in northern Hainan ahead of the enemy, to April 30th, when Yulin, Sanya, and Beili were liberated, in less than half a month, the enemy's three-dimensional air, land, and sea defense and key depth defense were completely shattered, the entire Qiongya Island was liberated, and the campaign to liberate Hainan Island was victoriously concluded.

Xinhua News Agency, Hainan Front, 1st: The People's Liberation Army on the Hainan front, in hot pursuit of the fleeing enemy along the eastern ring road of Qiong Island, occupied Jiaji City, the second largest town on Qiong Island, on the 25th. Prior to this, on the 24th, this route of the People's Liberation Army had defeated the 158th Division headquarters and its two regiments in the Huangzhu area northwest of Jiaji City, capturing over 800 enemy soldiers. Another unit of the People's Liberation Army defeated the headquarters of the 252nd Division of the enemy's 32nd Army and its two regiments, along with the 1st Training Division and the Independent Regiment, etc., near Hele City (north of Wanning) on the 26th, capturing over 1,700 enemy soldiers, and defeated another enemy force attempting to block our army's advance on Dongshan Ridge (more than ten miles north of Wanning). Our army has now crossed Lingchui County and is advancing rapidly towards Yulin Port.

The Western Route pursuit force also reached the Nada and Hexiang areas northeast of Baisha in western Hainan on the 26th and has now crossed Baisha and is advancing south.

Xinhua News Agency, Hainan Front, 30th: Haikou City, which was subjected to frantic destruction and looting by the Kuomintang bandit gang before liberation, has now initially restored order. When the People's Liberation Army on the Hainan front swept through northern Qiong Island and headed straight for Haikou City, the Kuomintang bandit army, which was collapsing across the board, set fire to Xiuying Wharf in Haikou City and looted gold shops, silver shops, and canned food stores in the city. After the liberation of Haikou City, the whole city set off firecrackers, the streets were crowded with joyous citizens, and slogans such as "Welcome to the meritorious People's Liberation Army" and "Down with the traitorous Kuomintang bandit gang" were posted in every street and alley. Electricity and water were supplied as usual that day, and stores that had been forced to close down before liberation due to looting and extortion by the remaining bandits had begun to operate, the order of the market had been initially restored, and the public sentiment was extremely jubilant.
