Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 13th: The latest issue of the magazine "New Times" published an article commenting on the U.S. economic conference held in Tokyo in the second half of April, which was dedicated to drafting a Marshall Plan for Asia. The article pointed out that the conference drafted a series of plans, such as how to trap Asian countries in a web of economic vassalage, while driving out the European partners of American monopoly capitalists from Asia; how to pull India into the planned aggressive bloc; and how to economically isolate the People's Republic of China.

The "New Times" magazine wrote: The secret envoys of American monopoly capitalists chose Tokyo as the venue for the meeting for good reason. In the Asian version of the Marshall Plan, Japan occupies a central position. Japan is seen as a major military and industrial base for the United States to carry out commercial and military expansion in Asia, while other Asian countries will serve as consumers for dumping American and Japanese goods, and suppliers of strategic raw materials.

The Tokyo conference encouraged the Japanese zaibatsu and militarists. Yoshida and his partners very cunningly unearthed those dusty files from the Tojo era. The conference received petitions, plans, and appeals from Japanese government agencies. These appeals glaringly revealed the terms and nouns that everyone was familiar with during the trials of major Japanese war criminals. Here, you will find suggestions to establish a "planning bureau" to include all Asian countries, and to incorporate all Asian countries into the yen bloc.... The only new thing in these petitions is that Japanese monopoly capitalists meekly agreed to be under the highest control of the United States. All these crazy conspiracy plans were praised in Washington, which is delaying and undermining democratic and peaceful agreements in the Far East.

The "New Times" concluded: Tojo and other villains, in their arrogant era, not only formulated conspiracy plans to prosper Japanese imperialism at the expense of the people of Asian countries, but even tried to realize these conspiracy plans by force. However, everyone knows what kind of end they met. And now, when the liberation movement of the people of Asian countries has grown in scale and strength, it would be more beneficial for the American and Japanese descendants of Tojo to think more often about the tragic end of their predecessors, rather than counting their chickens before they hatch.

### 亚洲人民不许美帝扶日侵略　美帝将走东条老路　新时代评东京经济会议

    新时代评东京经济会议
    【新华社十三日讯】塔斯社莫斯科十一日讯：最近一期《新时代》杂志著文评述四月下半月在东京举行的专为拟订对亚洲的马歇尔计划的美国经济会议，指出这次会议起草了一大串方案，例如怎样使亚洲各国陷入经济附庸的罗网，而把美国独占资本家的欧洲伙伴们逐出亚洲：怎样把印度拉进策划中的侵略集团；并且怎样使中华人民共和国在经济上陷于孤立。
    《新时代》杂志写道：美国独占资本家的密使们，选中了东京作为开会的场所，那是有充分理由的。在亚洲版的马歇尔计划中，日本占着中心地位。日本被视为便于美国在亚洲实行商业扩张和军事扩展的一个主要的军事基地和工业基地，而亚洲其他各国，则将充当美国货和日本货倾销的消费者，和战略原料的供给者。
    东京会议使日本财阀和军阀得到鼓励。吉田及其伙伴们，很奸滑地从档案中把东条时代的布满了尘埃的那些案卷发掘出来。这次会议接到了日本政府机关纷纷送来的请愿书、计划书和呼吁书。这些呼吁书中很刺目地流露出在审判日本主要战犯时大家听熟了的那些术语和名词。在这里，你们会发现这样的建议，就是要成立一个“计划局”，把亚洲所有各国都包括进去，并且要把亚洲所有一切国家都并入日元集团……。在这些请愿书内只有一点是新鲜的，就是日本独占资本家们很温顺地同意受美国最高的控制。这一切疯狂的阴谋计划，在华盛顿博得赞许，华盛顿正在怠工破坏远东的民主和平的协议。
    《新时代》末称：东条和其他恶棍们，在他们跋扈的时代，不仅拟定过以亚洲各国人民为牺牲而使日本帝国主义繁荣的阴谋计划，并且甚至竭力要凭借武力来实现这些阴谋计划。然而，每一个人都知道他们得到怎样的下场。而现在，当亚洲各国人民的解放运动在规模和力量上都已成长起来的时候，美国和日本的东条后裔们，如果不在小鸡还未孵出时就先数小鸡，而更时常想想他们前辈的那种悲哀的下场，那就对他们比较有益了。
