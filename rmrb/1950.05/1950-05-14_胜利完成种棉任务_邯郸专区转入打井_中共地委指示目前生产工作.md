　　Successfully Completing the Cotton Planting Task
　　Handan Prefecture Shifts to Well Digging
　　CCP Prefectural Committee Issues Instructions on Current Production Work

[Our Newspaper Handan News] After the Handan Prefecture in Hebei Province victoriously completed the cotton planting task, the CCP Handan Prefectural Committee specifically instructed the county committees and all Party members and cadres in the region to actively lead the masses, seize the opportunity to quickly shift to well digging as the focus, and concurrently carry out the sowing of other crops, weeding wheat, tending seedlings, preventing and controlling plant diseases and insect pests, developing sideline production, and establishing village and county administrations. The instructions pointed out: 1. The cotton planting work should be immediately inspected, and the question for the future is how to make the cotton grow well and yield more. 2. The central link in well digging is to organize cooperation and mutual assistance to solve the difficulties of manpower and materials, organize joint digging and joint use, and establish well digging mutual aid societies or mutual aid groups to change the old habit of wasting property in the past. Those who have genuine difficulties in well digging should be helped to find solutions, and coercion and commandism should be resolutely opposed. 3. Carry out sowing and complete the planting of peanuts and other crops. 4. Weed wheat and thin seedlings. Wheat fields should be weeded again universally, and all localities must vigorously mobilize women to participate. Strive to weed all spring seedlings, especially cotton, twice before the wheat harvest, which is an important link in achieving increased production. 5. Be vigilant about the occurrence of plant diseases and insect pests, and vigorously mobilize women and children to study and carry out pest control work. Special attention should be paid to the occurrence of cotton aphids. All counties should prepare a large amount of tobacco stalks and sprayers, and pay attention to inspection. If cotton aphids occur, they should be immediately captured and exterminated. Also be vigilant about other plant diseases and insect pests, and vigorously prevent and control them. 6. Organize surplus labor and animal power to develop sideline occupations. After the completion of spring plowing and sowing, in addition to well digging and weeding, mobilize and organize transportation, leaching saltpeter, manufacturing and repairing farm implements, collecting manure and accumulating fertilizer, and various workshop productions. Ensure that all surplus manpower and animal power are not wasted and that income is increased.
    [Another News] After completing cotton planting, Daming, Qiu County, Linzhang, Linqing, Yongnian, Wei County, Chengan and other counties in Handan Prefecture have quickly shifted to well digging. According to Daming statistics on April 25th: In the first, third, fifth, and seventh districts, the original well digging task was 234 wells, of which 63 have been completed, 36 are being dug, and 185 have prepared materials. And it is proposed that they have the confidence and determination to complete the task of 500 wells before the wheat harvest. After completing the cotton planting, the Qiu County Chen Village base point's task of 30 wells was fully turned to well digging, and now 25 wells have been completed. Linzhang has completed the digging of 17 wells, and a total of more than 300 wells are planned to be dug. Other counties have also taken action. Wei County has completed 72 wells, Linqing combined with the completion of 58 wells during cotton planting, and Yongnian has completed 49 wells. In order to cooperate with the completion of the well digging task, supply and marketing cooperatives and banks have purchased more than 17,000 bamboo poles, 18,800 catties of plate bristles, 9,885 catties of nails, 16,072,560 bricks, and 16,962 waterwheel buckets to help villages dig wells.
