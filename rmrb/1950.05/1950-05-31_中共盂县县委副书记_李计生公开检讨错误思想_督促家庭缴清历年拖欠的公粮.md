[Our Newspaper Taiyuan News] Li Jisheng, former Deputy Secretary of the CPC Yu County Committee in Shanxi Province, recently publicly examined his personal selfish viewpoints and privileged thinking, corrected his mistakes, and urged his family to pay off the arrears in public grain over the years. The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) is using this example to educate all party members in the province, calling for the development of criticism and self-criticism.

Li Jisheng is from Dingxiang County in the Xinxian Special District of Shanxi Province. From 1947 to 1949, his family owed a total of 1,112 kilograms of public grain. In 1948, Li Jisheng was serving as the Minister of Civil Affairs of the CPC County Committee in that county. When the county concluded the clearance of arrears in public grain, Zhou Xuanhua, the secretary of the county government, criticized Li Jisheng and urged him to take the lead in mobilizing his family to pay off the public grain in order to avoid affecting the government's grain collection work. However, Li Jisheng did not accept this criticism. This kind of selfish viewpoint and privileged thinking on the part of Li Jisheng and a small number of Communist Party members in the county caused the phenomenon of unfair public grain burden in the county, affecting the relationship between the Party and the masses and the completion of the government's collection tasks. Last winter, when Dingxiang County held a people's representative conference, the representatives exposed the above facts. On January 1st of this year, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC accepted the opinions of the masses and instructed the Xinxian District Committee to solve the problem of unfair burden in Dingxiang County. In February, the Shanxi Provincial Congress of the CPC also conducted ideological criticism of this matter. Li Jisheng began to realize his mistake, but at the beginning, he still used the excuses that "his family is not a well-to-do household" and "did not directly support the family's failure to pay public grain" in an attempt to shirk responsibility and conceal his mistakes. Later, after repeated criticism and education by the Provincial Committee and the District Committee, Li Jisheng was determined to correct his mistakes. In addition to returning home to pay off all the owed public grain, he also publicly admitted his mistakes at the county party representative meeting and in his village, and made a public self-criticism, explaining that as a Communist Party member and a responsible cadre of the county, he had not actively urged his family to correct their behavior of violating government decrees and resisting the payment of grain over the years, which had left a serious negative impact inside and outside the Party, and that this was a direct violation of Party discipline. He went on to examine that the ideological source of this mistake was due to his own selfish viewpoints and privileged thinking, which only considered the interests of his own family and forgot the interests of the Party and the country. Therefore, he expressed his willingness to accept the Party's punishment and education, and determined to correct his mistakes and correct his bad thinking. When the Shanxi Daily published this news on April 29th, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC added an instruction, calling on all party members in the province to launch criticism and self-criticism in order to correct this kind of bad thinking and behavior. If there are still elements who do not accept the Party's education and insist on their mistakes, they will be given the due disciplinary action in accordance with the Party Constitution. In order to continue to help Li Jisheng further correct his mistakes, the Provincial Committee also decided to remove him from his position as Deputy Secretary of the Yu County Committee.

　　中共盂县县委副书记
    李计生公开检讨错误思想     
    督促家庭缴清历年拖欠的公粮
    【本报太原讯】山西省前中共盂县县委副书记李计生，最近公开检讨个人的自私观点与特权思想，并改正错误，督促其家庭缴清历年来拖欠的公粮。山西省委特以此事例教育全省党员，号召展开批评与自我批评。
    李计生是山西忻县专区定襄县人，其家庭自一九四七年至一九四九年，共拖欠公粮一千一百一十二斤。一九四八年李计生正担任该县中共县委民运部长，当该县结束公粮尾欠时，县政府秘书周宣华曾对李计生提出批评，促其发动自己家庭率先缴清公粮，以免影响政府征粮工作。但李计生未接受此一批评。李计生与该县少数共产党员的此种自私观点与特权思想，曾造成该县的公粮负担不公现象，影响了党与群众的关系和政府征收任务的完成。去冬定襄县召开各界人民代表会议时，代表们揭发了上述事实。今年一月一日，中共山西省委会接受了群众意见，指示忻县地委解决定襄县负担不公问题。二月，山西省中共党代表会议，又对此事从思想上进行了批判。李计生始发觉他的错误，但开始时仍借口“自己家庭不是殷实户”、“并无直接支持家庭不缴公粮的行为”、希图推脱责任，掩饰错误。后经省委、地委再三批评教育，李计生乃决心改正错误。除回家将所欠公粮全部缴清外，并在该县党代表会上及所在村中公开承认了自己的错误，作了公开的自我批评，说明他身为共产党员与县的负责干部，对家中历年来违反政府法令，抗不缴粮的行为未积极督促改正，在党内外留下了严重的不良的影响，这是直接违反党的纪律的行为。他进而检讨发生此一错误的思想根源是由于自己的自私观点与特权思想在作祟，只从自己家庭利益着想而忘记了党与国家的利益。因此他表示愿意接受党的处分与教育，决心改正错误与纠正不良思想。四月二十九日山西日报发表此项消息时，中共山西省委并加了批示，号召全省党员展开批评与自我批评，以纠正此种不良思想与行为。如仍有不接受党的教育，坚持错误的分子，将按党章予以应得的纪律处分。省委为继续帮助李计生进一步改正错误，并决定解除其盂县县委副书记职务。
