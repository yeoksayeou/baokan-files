(Hankou News) According to the Changjiang Daily on the 15th of this month: In more than ten cities in the Central and Southern Region, including Wuhan, Changsha, Nanchang, Kaifeng, and Zhengzhou, some private industrial and commercial enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood have overcome temporary difficulties due to workers voluntarily reducing wages, paying attention to economy, actively discussing changes in business policies with the capitalists, and receiving assistance from the state-owned economy. Some enterprises have even achieved development. In Hankou, shop assistants of seven cloth shops, including Hua Shen and Jiu Da, voluntarily proposed to receive 80% or 60% of their salaries to reduce the shop's expenses. Workers at the Tongren Tobacco Factory in Nanyang paid attention to saving raw materials; each tray of paper in the cigarette rolling room produced 28 more cigarettes than before; each box of cigarettes saved five catties of tobacco shreds in the tobacco cutting room. Workers at the Shashi Yarn Factory worked hard to repair the machines, and the output doubled compared to the past; the diesel engine oil consumption was reduced by more than two barrels per day. In order to open up production avenues, workers at the Kaifeng Gongmao Automobile Repair Factory suggested to the factory to add a sand casting department to manufacture automobile parts; and prepared to face the countryside, manufacturing cotton gins, oil presses, etc. The capitalists have agreed, and are actively preparing to expand production. Workers at the Nanchang Zhenhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory voluntarily formulated production plans and labor discipline, which increased output compared to the past, and prompted the capitalists to set up offices in Linchuan, Ji'an, and other places to promote products and let go of management.

Under the influence and promotion of workers, the capitalists are also actively changing their business policies and management methods. In Hankou, the textile, soap, and food industries have successively established labor-management consultation meetings to resolve issues related to production and wages through meetings. Workers at the Yueyang Electric Power Company took the initiative to improve production efficiency, which improved the company's business. After that, the capitalists changed their passive attitude, actively improved the business organization, and formulated various work systems in order to further improve production.

State-owned enterprises and institutions provided strong assistance to private enterprises through processing and ordering. With the support of the People's Government, the Hankou Xinsheng Yarn Factory not only maintained production but also expanded the spindles by one time. The monthly output increased from 30 pieces to 130 pieces. After the Changsha Zhongzhou Cotton Weaving Factory signed a processing contract with the Hunan Branch of the Department Store Company, the difficulty of product backlog was resolved.

　　中南区若干私营工商业
    劳资协力克服困难
    【汉口讯】据本月十五日长江日报讯：中南区武汉、长沙、南昌、开封、郑州等十余城市中，若干有利于国计民生的私营工商业，由于工友们主动减低工资，注意节约，积极与资方研究改变经营方针；又得到国营经济的扶助，已经渡过暂时的困难。部分企业且已获得发展。汉口布匹业华申、久大等七家布店店员，自动提出按八折或六折支取薪资，借以减少店方开支。南阳同仁烟厂工友注意节约原料，卷烟室每一盘纸较前多产烟二十八条；切烟室每箱烟节约五斤烟丝。沙市纱厂工友努力修好机器，产量比过去增加一倍；柴油机油耗每天节省二桶多。为打开生产门路，开封工茂汽车修配厂工人向厂方建议，添设翻沙部门，自造汽车零件；并准备面向农村，制造轧花机、榨油机等，现已获得资方同意，正在积极准备扩大生产。南昌振华染织厂工人，自动订立生产计划与劳动纪律，产量较前提高，推动资方在临川、吉安等地设立办事处，推销产品，放手经营。
    资方在工人推动影响下，也在积极改变营业方针和管理方法。汉口纺织业、肥皂业、食品业纷纷成立劳资协商会议，通过会议解决有关生产及工资等问题。岳阳电业公司工友主动提高生产效率，使得公司营业好转后，资方已消极态度，积极改进业务机构，订立了各种工作制度，以便进一步提高生产。
    国营企业机关通过加工、定货的方式，给予私营企业以有力扶助。汉口新甡纱厂经人民政府扶助，不仅维持了生产，且已扩充纱锭一倍。每月产量由三十件增至一百三十件。长沙中州棉织厂与百货公司湖南分公司订立加工合同后，产品滞销的困难已得解决。
