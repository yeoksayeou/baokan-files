　　【Beijing News Agency】Workers at the private Jingwei Weaving Factory in Beijing are assisting the capitalists in overcoming temporary difficulties in production. They have agreed with the capitalists to sign a short-term contract, appropriately reduce wages, and work hard to practice thrift and improve product quality. The factory's trade union has always closely integrated its work with production, taking the initiative to unite with the capitalists to cooperate in production. The capitalist, Qi Lianzhu, is also relatively willing to adopt workers' opinions. In May of last year, a factory management committee was established, solving many problems in the factory related to improving production, wages, and welfare. In response to the government's call to organize labor-capital consultation meetings in private factories, the factory's employees reorganized the original management committee into a consultation meeting last month on the 20th, with three representatives from both labor and capital. Recently, at the consultation meeting, the capitalist stated that there are current difficulties in capital turnover, with income not covering expenses and production losses, and hoped to reduce wages. After the workers carefully calculated the factory's production costs and various expenses, they agreed to reduce wages to maintain production and overcome the temporary difficulties. Labor and capital agreed to implement a wage reduction for two months starting in May, and then adjust it again based on the specific situation. The reduced wages are as follows: for power loom "August 1st Cloth," the wage is three jin of millet per bolt. The quota is 34 bolts, and wages are progressively increased for exceeding the quota. Generally, 52 bolts can be woven per month, with a wage of 171 jin, a reduction of 27% compared to the original wage; for hand loom weaving, the wage is eight jin of millet per bolt. The quota is 13 bolts, and generally 19 bolts can be woven per month, with a wage of 168 jin of millet, a reduction of 19% compared to the original. In this way, the weaving wages are still not lower than the minimum wage level stipulated in the labor-capital collective contract for the weaving and dyeing industry. The salaries of staff members have also been reduced by an average of 35%. The factory's food supply for employees was originally equivalent to 80 jin of millet per month, but is now reduced to 70 jin of millet. In terms of welfare: the uniforms provided by the capitalist have been temporarily cancelled, haircuts have been changed from three times a month to twice, bathing has been changed from twice a month to once, and medical expenses were originally stipulated that if a worker was ill, the capitalist would be responsible for expenses within 25 jin of millet, and if exceeded, labor and capital would each pay half. Now, it has been changed to each party paying half completely, but the capitalist is still fully responsible for work-related injuries. At the same time, the workers believe that simply reducing wages and welfare is not a fundamental solution to business difficulties, so they are focusing on the problems existing in production, practicing strict economy in raw materials, reducing costs, and improving quality. Previously, machine parts such as shuttles and belts were discarded and replaced with new ones when they broke. Now, new ones must be exchanged for old ones, and efforts are made to repair the old ones for reuse. The workers are also studying how to reduce residual threads and strive to save electricity. There has been progress in improving quality, and the rate of substandard cloth has been significantly reduced. In all products, Grade B cloth accounted for 45% in March, but decreased to 20% in April, while Grade A cloth increased from 45% to 80%. Due to these concessions and efforts by the workers, according to the capitalist's statistics, monthly expenses can be reduced by more than 9,000 jin of millet, which not only reverses the losses but also allows for considerable profit. Liu Shengde, the chairman of the factory's trade union, said: "Our workers are looking at long-term interests and are confident that we can help the capitalist overcome this difficulty, so although wages and welfare have been reduced, the workers' production enthusiasm is still very high." Due to the workers' active production in overcoming difficulties and using labor-capital consultation meetings to solve factory production problems, the capitalist has also increased confidence in overcoming the current business difficulties and is preparing to install the four machines that have not yet been started to expand production after clearing debts.

　　私营经纬织布厂工人
    协助资方克服暂时困难
    自五月起实行降低工资两个月
    【京市新闻处讯】京市私营经纬织布厂工人协助资方克服目前生产中的暂时困难，与资方协议签订短期合同，适当降低工资，并努力开展节约、提高产品质量。该厂由于工会工作密切结合生产，一向主动团结资方协力生产，资方齐联珠也比较能够采纳工人意见，去年五月间就成立工厂管理委员会，解决了工厂中改进生产、工资、福利等不少问题。该厂职工为响应政府在私营工厂中组织劳资协商会议的号召，于上月二十日改组原来管委会成立协商会议，由劳资双方各派代表三人。最近在协商会议上，资方提出目前资金周转困难，入不敷出，生产亏累的情况，希望降低工资。经工人把工厂生产成本和各项开支精打细算结果，同意降低工资，以维持生产，渡过暂时困难。劳资双方协议自五月起实行降低工资两个月，以后根据具体情况再行调整。降低后的工资为：电力织布“八一布”每匹工资小米三斤。定额是三十四匹，工资超额累进，一般每月可织到五十二匹，工资是一百七十一斤，比原来工资降低百分之二十七；人力织布每匹工资八斤小米，定额是十三匹，一般每月可织到十九匹，工资是一百六十八斤小米，比原来降低百分之十九。这样，织布工资还不低于织染业劳资集体合同所规定的最低工资水平。职员的薪金也都平均降低百分之三十五。厂方供给职工伙食原来每月是折八十斤小米，现降低为七十斤小米。福利方面：资方供给的制服暂时取消，理发由每月三次改为两次，洗澡由每月两次改为一次，医药费原规定工人有病，费用在二十五斤小米以内由资方负责，超过时由劳资各出一半，现改为完全由双方各出一半，因公致伤则仍全由资方负责。同时，工人认为单纯降低工资福利不是解决业务困难的根本办法，所以针对生产上存在的问题，厉行节约原料、降低成本、提高质量。以前机器零件如梭子、皮带等坏了就废弃领新的，现在必须以旧的换新的，尽量把旧的修好再用，工人们还正研究怎样消减残线，努力节电。在提高质量方面已有进步，次布率显著减少，在全部产品中，三月份乙级布占百分之四十五，四月份乙级布减少到百分之二十，甲级布则由百分之四十五提高到百分之八十。由于工人这些让步与努力，据资方统计，每月可以减少开支达九千余斤小米，不但扭转赔累，并能获得相当盈余。该厂工会主任刘生德说：“我们工人着眼长远利益，有信心能够帮助资方渡过这一步困难，所以工资、福利虽然降低，工人生产情绪仍非常高。”资方由于工人的积极生产克服困难和运用劳资协商会议解决工厂生产问题，也提高了渡过目前业务困难的信心，准备在偿清债务之后，把四部还未开动的机器安装起来扩大生产。
