　　Production Committee Member Lei Laohe Leads Villagers of Zhoujiazhuang to Prosperity by Growing Cotton
    Ke Ming
    Lei Laohe, the Production Committee member of Zhoujiazhuang Village in the Fourth District of Jin County, Hebei, actively led the villagers to grow cotton and was selected as a model village leader in production. He is sixty-three years old this year, a Communist Party member, and has been a village cadre for seven or eight years. His work ethic has always been very good.
    Zhoujiazhuang has a total of 493 households and 7,190 mu of both irrigated and dry land. Under the leadership of him, village government chairman Lei Shuangqiu, and Party branch secretary Lei Jinhe, they dispelled various ideological concerns of the masses. Last year, they planted 3,320 mu of cotton, with an average yield of 150 jin of seed cotton per mu, totaling 498,000 jin. During the collection and sale, the government guaranteed a price of one jin of seed cotton equivalent to three jin and seven taels of rice, benefiting all cotton growers greatly. From last year to this spring, the village increased from 160 wells to 165 wells; 140 waterwheels increased to 172; and 86 old and weak livestock were replaced with strong ones, and 60 new ones were added. The village now has a total of 293 livestock, averaging almost one head of livestock per household. During the autumn cotton collection, he also promoted and took the lead in handing in good quality cotton. The cotton handed in by the village was top-notch throughout the county.
    At the beginning of this year's cotton planting, because the masses benefited from growing cotton last year, they were very enthusiastic about planting cotton. However, many people had difficulties, such as a lack of fertilizer and seeds (seed cotton was handed over during the autumn collection last year). Lei Laohe, together with village government chairman Lei Shuangqiu and village branch secretary Lei Jinhe, organized the masses to press oil, earning 20,000 jin of cottonseed. They also negotiated with the village oil mill to lend 20,000 jin of oil cake to the masses, to be repaid with cotton in the autumn. The county supply and marketing cooperative also lent more than 20,000 jin of cottonseed and 6,000 jin of oil cake. In this way, the difficulties of lacking fertilizer and seeds were resolved. However, some people were worried: "Growing more cotton is more profitable. But if everyone grows it, there will be less grain, and the price of cotton will be lower, won't it? If we don't grow grain, where will the rice and straw come from?" Faced with these concerns, Lei Laohe and all the village cadres, Party members, and primary school teachers, through blackboard newspapers, slogans, and informal talks in the streets and fields, explained to the masses:
    "The government has issued a notice guaranteeing that one jin of Si-brand ginned cotton is equivalent to eight to ten jin of rice!"
    "Our China has a vast territory! We grow more cotton here, and other places grow more grain. Now that the railways are open and transportation is convenient, we can easily exchange them!"
    Then, he and all the village cadres and Communist Party members took the lead in growing more cotton and mobilized the masses from door to door. He had seventeen mu of white land and planted sixteen mu with cotton. The village's 41 cadres and Party members, with 674 mu of white land, planted 590 mu of cotton. Lei Laohe and another Party member, Lei Laobiao, mobilized 21 households to plant a total of 76 mu of cotton. On April 16th, after a thorough rain, he and the village cadres and Party members went separately to lead the masses in mutual aid. The village's 508 able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers formed 74 mutual aid teams, completing the cotton planting plan in just over four days. The land of revolutionary martyrs' and soldiers' families without labor was given priority for planting. He also took the lead in helping 21 widowed and orphaned households without labor to plant cotton. They, five people, helped Liu Laogu, who was over eighty years old, plant four mu of cotton. Liu Laogu was overjoyed and said to them, "Laohe! How can I repay you and the villagers!"
    Now, the village's plan to plant 4,672 mu of cotton has been exceeded, with a total of 5,075 and a half mu planted, accounting for 69 percent of the village's cultivated land and 80 percent of the white land. After replanting, the cotton seedlings have all emerged. Farmers who started early have already begun thinning and hoeing the cotton! Looking at their beloved cotton seedlings and thinking about the autumn harvest, no one can forget Chairman Mao, who led them to turn over a new leaf; nor can they forget Production Committee member Lei Laohe and all the village cadres and Communist Party members who have tried every means to lead them in growing cotton.

　　周家庄生产委员雷老和领导全村群众种棉发家
    克明
    河北晋县四区周家庄村生产委员雷老和，积极领导全村群众种棉花，当选了村领导生产的模范。他今年六十三岁，是共产党员，当村干部七、八年了，工作精神一向很好。
    周家庄共四百九十三户，水旱地七千一百九十亩。在他和村政府主席雷双秋、支部书记雷金和等领导下，打通群众的各种思想顾虑，去年种了三千三百二十亩棉花，平均每亩收籽棉一百五十斤，共收籽棉四十九万八千斤。征收和出卖时，政府保证了一斤籽棉折合三斤七两米的价格，种棉户全沾了大光。自去年到今春，全村由一百六十眼水井增到一百六十五眼；一百四十辆水车增到一百七十二辆；八十六头老弱牲口都换成壮的牲口，还新添了六十头。现全村共有牲口二百九十三头，平均一家半就有了一头牲口。去秋征收棉花时，他又宣传并带头缴好棉花。该村缴的棉花，在全县来说都是头等的。
    今年种棉开始时，由于去年群众种棉得了实利，群众种棉的劲头很大，可是，也有不少群众有困难，如缺少肥料、种籽（去年秋征时缴的籽棉）。雷老和便协同村政府主席雷双秋和该村支部书记雷金和组织群众打油，赚了两万斤棉籽。又跟村油坊商妥，贷给群众二万斤油饼，秋后还棉花。县供销社又贷给了两万多斤棉籽，六千斤油饼。这样，缺肥料、缺种籽的困难都解决了。可是有的群众发生顾虑：“多种棉花得利多。但都多种起来，粮食少了，棉价不就低了？不种谷子，那里来的米和草？”对着这些顾虑，雷老和及全村干部、党员、小学教员就通过黑板报、标语以及街头、地头上漫谈，向群众作解释：
    “政府里出了布告，一斤斯字皮棉保证折合八斤到十斤米！”
    “咱中国地面大哩！咱这里种棉多，别处种谷多。现在铁路都通了，交通方便，一换就行咧！”
    接着，他和全体村干部、共产党员，就以身作则多种棉，并分头挨户动员群众。他有十七亩白地，种了十六亩棉花。全村干部、党员四十一户，六百七十四亩白地，种了五百九十亩棉花。雷老和和另一个党员雷老表，动员了二十一户群众，共多种棉花七十六亩。四月十六日下了透雨，他和村干、党员又分头去带动群众互助。全村五百零八个整半劳动力，组成了七十四个互助组，四天多就完成了种棉计划。无劳动力的烈、军属土地，都尽先种上。他又带头帮助二十一户无劳动力的孤寡户种棉。他们五个人帮助八十多岁的刘老固把四亩棉花种上。刘老固欢喜透了，对他们说：“老和！我拿什么来待你和乡亲们呵！”
    现在，全村种棉四千六百七十二亩的计划已经超过，共种了五千零七十五亩半，占全村耕地百分之六十九，占白地百分之八十。经过补种后，现在棉苗已全部出齐。下手早的农民，已开始拔苗和锄棉了！农民们看着心爱的棉苗，想着秋后的丰收，谁也忘不了领导翻身的毛主席；也忘不了想尽各种办法领导他们种棉的生产委员雷老和和全体村干部、共产党员。
