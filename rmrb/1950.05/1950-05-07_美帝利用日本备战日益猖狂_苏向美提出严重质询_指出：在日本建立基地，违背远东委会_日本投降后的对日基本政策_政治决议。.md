　　Xinhua News Agency, May 5th: TASS, Tokyo, May 4th: On May 3rd, Lieutenant General Derevyanko, the Soviet member of the Allied Council for Japan, handed General MacArthur, the US Commander of the Occupation Forces in Japan, a letter, the full text of which is as follows:

　　From the news published in American and Japanese newspapers, as well as the statements made by official American representatives, it can be seen that the former naval and air force bases of Japan are currently being restored and modernized.

　　On February 2, 1950, the *Pacific Stars and Stripes*, the organ of the US occupation forces in Japan, reported that Rear Admiral Dick, commander of the Yokosuka Naval Base, stated at a meeting of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff attended by Admiral Sherman, General Bradley, and General Collins, that the Yokosuka base is a base where naval vessels and ships of all levels and types can be stationed, and it is a base with equipment for repairing large naval vessels, which can be used in the event of war.

　　Regarding this issue, the *Yomiuri Shimbun* stated on March 22, 1950, that Dick "...is able to draft a plan to restore the Yokosuka base, realize this plan, and establish a strong naval base in the Far East..."

　　Regarding this point, it must be noted that as early as April 1948, the *Pacific Stars and Stripes* mentioned a speech by Admiral Ramsay, Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet, in Pearl Harbor, which stated that in the event of military action in the Far East, the naval bases of Sasebo, Kure, and Yokosuka, together with the bases on Okinawa and Guam, would constitute a powerful combined forward operating base.

　　Similar news has also been published regarding air force bases.

　　On January 18, 1950, the *Japan Times* published an article by Brian, the Tokyo bureau chief of the Associated Press, stating that several airports have been established from Hokkaido to Kyushu, with concrete runways capable of accommodating the largest bombers.

　　Lieutenant General Stratemeyer, Commander of the US Far East Air Force, also confirmed the construction of permanent airport facilities on Okinawa.

　　The *Japan Times* reported on April 4, 1950, that Assistant Secretary of the US Army Voorhees formally declared during a speech to the House Appropriations Subcommittee on April 3, 1950, that large-scale military construction is underway in the Ryukyu Islands.

　　In view of the above, in my capacity as the Soviet member of the Allied Council for Japan, I request that you inform me whether the aforementioned news is true. Because I am deeply aware that the restoration of the former Japanese naval and air force bases is incompatible with the obligations jointly undertaken by the United States and the Soviet Union, as well as other member states of the Far Eastern Commission, in accordance with the Far Eastern Commission's political resolution of June 19, 1947, on the "Basic Post-Surrender Policy for Japan."

　　美帝利用日本备战日益猖狂
    苏向美提出严重质询
    指出：在日本建立基地，违背远东委会“日本投降后的对日基本政策”政治决议。
    【新华社五日讯】塔斯社东京四日电：五月三日，盟国对日管制委员会苏联委员德勒维扬哥中将向美国驻日占领军司令麦克阿瑟将军递交一函，全文如下：
    从美国和日本报纸所发表的消息，以及美国官方代表所发表的声明中可以看到：日本的前海空军基地目前正在着手恢复和加以现代化。
    一九五○年二月二日，美驻日占领军机关报——太平洋星条报报道：横须贺海军基地司令狄克少将，在有薛尔曼海军上将、布莱德雷和柯林斯将军出席的美国参谋长会议上发表谈话，说横须贺基地是这样一个基地：海军舰只和各级各型的船只均能驻泊在那里，它是一个具有修理大型海军船只设备的基地，一旦发生战争时可加以使用。
    关于这个问题，读卖新闻在一九五○年三月二十二日称：狄克“……能够拟订恢复横须贺基地的计划，实现这一计划，并在远东建立强有力的海军基地……”。
    关于这一点，必须注意，早在一九四八年四月，太平洋星条报就曾谈到太平洋舰队总司令兰姆赛在珍珠港的谈话，这个谈话说：一旦在远东发生军事行动，佐世保、吴港和横须贺的海军基地加上冲绳岛与关岛的基地，将构成强大的联合前进作战基地。
    关于空军基地也发表过类似的消息。
    一九五○年一月十八日，日本时报发表了美联社东京分社社长白里安的一篇文章称：自北海道到九州，已建立了若干飞机场，并有能容纳最大型轰炸机的水泥跑道。
    美国驻远东空军总司令斯特拉特梅耶中将也证实了在冲绳岛建筑永久性的机场设备。
    日本时报一九五○年四月四日报道称：美国陆军部助理部长伍里斯于一九五○年四月三日在众院拨款小组委员会演说时，正式宣称：在琉球群岛正进行大规模的军事建筑。
    鉴于上述各节，我以盟国对日委员会苏联委员的身份，要求你告诉我前述消息是否确实。因为我深知：恢复前日本的海军与空军基地，是与美国及苏联以及其他远东委员会会员国家根据远东委员会一九四七年六月十九日“日本投降后的对日基本政策”的政治决议所共同担负的义务，是不相容的。
