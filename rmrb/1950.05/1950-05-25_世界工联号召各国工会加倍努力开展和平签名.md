　　Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 24th: According to TASS, the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) heard and discussed the report by WFTU General Secretary Saillant on "The Tasks of the WFTU in the Struggle for Peace" on the 20th.

　　Saillant pointed out: The ranks of peace advocates are growing and strengthening day by day. The reason why the peace movement has won a wide response among the working people of all countries around the world is because the imperialists' policy of preparing for a new war only benefits a small group of monopoly capitalists.

　　After listing the facts of the imperialists' frenzied arms race and its adverse effects on the living standards of the working people, Saillant emphasized the tasks of the WFTU in the struggle for peace, stating: The WFTU advocates that trade union organizations must redouble their efforts for the movement to collect signatures for the World Peace Council declaration; all national trade union central agencies and all trade union organizations must actively participate in the preparations for the Second World Peace Congress to be held in the fourth quarter of 1950. In order to do this work well, the main tasks of the WFTU in this regard are: to establish and consolidate peace committees; to provide spiritual and material assistance to transport workers and workers in other industries who are crushing the sinister plans of the warmongers; to provide all possible assistance to the people in colonies and semi-colonies who are fighting for national liberation. At the same time, the trade unions affiliated with the WFTU must strengthen the international solidarity of the working class, resolutely oppose the bloody suppression of all working people by capitalist countries; must constantly expose the traitorous activities of the scab organization, the so-called "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions"; each trade union international must publish materials on the adverse consequences of the implementation of the Marshall Plan in various industrial sectors; must use all propaganda tools to expose the anti-Soviet and anti-people's democratic countries' slander.

　　Representatives from Poland, France, Mongolia, China, the Soviet Union and other countries cited vivid facts during the discussion of Saillant's report, illustrating the huge development of the peace movement in their respective countries. Representatives from Greece, India, Ceylon and other countries also spoke, expressing the determination of the people of their respective countries to oppose war.

　　世界工联号召各国工会加倍努力开展和平签名
    【新华社二十四日讯】据塔斯社布达佩斯讯：世界工联执行委员会二十日的会议，听取并讨论了世界工联总书记赛扬“关于世界工联在争取和平斗争中之任务的报告”。
    赛扬指出：和平拥护者的阵营，正在一天天地成长和加强。和平运动之所以在全世界各国劳动人民中赢得了广泛响应的原因，是因为帝国主义者准备新战争的政策，仅仅有利于一小撮垄断资本家。
    赛扬在列举帝国主义者疯狂备战的事实及其对劳动人民生活水准所发生的恶果后，强调指出世界工联在争取和平斗争中的任务称：世界工联主张：各工会组织必须加倍为世界和大常委会宣言征集签名的运动而努力；各全国性的工会中央机构和所有工会组织，必须积极参加即将于一九五○年第四季举行的第二届世界拥护和平大会的筹备工作。为了把这一工作作好，世界工联在这一方面的主要任务是：建立和巩固拥护和平委员会；对正在粉碎战争贩子的罪恶计划的运输工人及其他各业工人，予以精神上和物质上的援助；对殖民地和半殖民地为民族解放而斗争的人民，予以一切可能的援助。同时，世界工联所属各工会，必须加强工人阶级的国际团结，坚决反对资本主义国家对一切劳动人民的血腥镇压；必须经常揭发工贼组织，即所谓“国际自由工会联合会”的叛逆活动；各工会国际必须在工业各个部门中发表马歇尔计划实施后的恶果的材料；必须运用一切宣传工具来揭露反苏反人民民主国家的诽谤。
    波兰、法国、蒙古、中国、苏联等国的代表，在讨论赛扬报告时均举出生动的事实，说明和平运动在各国的巨大开展。希腊、印度、锡兰等国的代表亦发言，表示各该国的人民反对战争的决心。
