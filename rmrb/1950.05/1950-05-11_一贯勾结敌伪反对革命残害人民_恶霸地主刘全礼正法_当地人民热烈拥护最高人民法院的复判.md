　　Consistently Colluding with the Enemy and Puppets, Opposing the Revolution, and Brutally Harming the People:
　　Landlord Tyrant Liu Quanli Executed
　　Local People Warmly Support the Supreme People's Court's Review
　　[Kyoto City News Agency] The Kyoto City People's Court yesterday (the 10th), at a mass meeting in Yangfang Village in the suburbs, announced the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government's review of the case of landlord tyrant and murderer Liu Quanli, upholding the death sentence, and executed him on the spot.
　　Liu Quanli was a landlord tyrant in Yangfang Village in the suburbs, who consistently opposed the people's revolutionary cause. After the July 7th Incident, the criminal, in collusion with his son Liu Qingtai (who later served as the deputy group leader of the Fourth District Center of the "Central Unification"), murdered Yangfang villagers Yin Sigazi, Yin Hengzu, and Fan Yinzong in 1939 under the pretext of communicating with "bandits"; in April 1946, he colluded with "Central Unification" secret agent Yin Hengliang and the puppet Wanping County Militia to murder Zhang Shutian, director of the Yangfang Village Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association, Wang Dianchen, member of the Poor Peasants Committee, and Yin Xishi, a military dependent who was pregnant; in October 1947, he masterminded the murder of a People's Liberation Army staff member. In addition, the criminal relied on the power of the enemy and puppets to arrest, torture, extort property from the masses, and forcibly conscript laborers, committing numerous crimes. After liberation, the Fengtai Public Security Sub-bureau accepted the masses' accusations and arrested the criminal, submitting him to the People's Court for trial and sentencing to death. The criminal appealed, and after review by the Supreme People's Court of the Central People's Government, the death sentence was upheld. The announcement was made yesterday at a mass meeting in Yangfang Village in the suburbs, and the execution was carried out on the spot. At that time, the masses enthusiastically shouted slogans such as "Support the People's Court's reasonable judgment" and "Long live the people's liberation."
