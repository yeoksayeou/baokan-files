　　Workers of Xuanhua Paper Mill and Others
    Intensify Production to Welcome May Day and Create New Production Achievements

    [Reported by this newspaper] To welcome the first May Day after the founding of the People's Republic of China, workers from Xuanhua Paper Mill, Longyan Mining Machinery Factory, and Baotou Power Plant have been intensifying production and creating new production achievements. To welcome "May Day," the Xuanhua Paper Mill fully launched a production competition on April 9th. In the past half-month, the factory has increased its daily paper production from 175 reams to 255 reams, reduced waste by 10 percent compared to before, and lowered costs by 10 percent. Workers at the Longyan Mining Machinery Factory assembling fishplate bolts have increased their daily output from 350 pieces to 940 pieces; even the lowest output has reached 570 pieces. The factory's sand casting department has improved its technology, reducing the time for opening a furnace from three days to two days, increasing production efficiency by one-third. The Baotou Power Plant began a major overhaul of its 1,500-horsepower No. 1 boiler on the 20th of this month, and also began repairing lines and investigating electricity theft, striving to further improve equipment efficiency and increase electricity supply for production development.
