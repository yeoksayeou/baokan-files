　　Promote Policy Combined with Tax Investigation and Anti-Smuggling
　　Yu County Merchants and Businessmen Voluntarily Pay Back Taxes
　　[Report from our Zhangjiakou Office] Yu County, Chahar Province, focusing on the central work of the county, emphasized checking tax evasion, combined policy promotion with investigation and anti-smuggling, and adopted a policy of light punishment and heavy education to promote merchants and businessmen to voluntarily pay back taxes, resulting in good results.
　　A total of 274 merchants and businesses voluntarily paid stamp tax, goods tax, and transaction tax, among which the supplementary tax payment for stamp tax and goods tax totaled 6,837,405 yuan, and transaction tax was 101.2 shi of millet. Some even voluntarily surrendered false accounts. Tax evasion cases discovered included 15 cases of stamp tax evasion, amounting to 791,049 yuan; 18 cases of transaction tax evasion, amounting to 23.26 shi of millet; 9 cases of goods tax evasion, amounting to 3,239,175 yuan; 3 cases of temporary business tax evasion, amounting to 120,057 yuan; and 9 cases of private brewing, with 31 jin of liquor confiscated. 22 cases and 185 volumes of false accounts were discovered. These cases will be dealt with successively.
　　As a result of this investigation, the income of various taxes in April increased. In March, the county's actual tax revenue was 1,196.8 jin of millet (including temporary business tax, stamp tax, goods tax, transaction tax, and slaughter tax), while in April it was 1,604 jin, an actual increase of 407.2 jin. Facts have proven that the current temporary difficulties in industry and commerce lead to a decline in tax revenue, but if anti-smuggling efforts are strengthened and tax evasion is prevented, it is still possible to complete the task. However, in this investigation in Yu County, many areas still show the phenomenon of coercion and commandism, which should be given great attention.

　　宣传政策结合稽查缉私
    蔚县商民自动补税
    【本报张家口讯】察南蔚县围绕该县中心工作，重点检查漏税、并使宣传政策与稽查、缉私很好结合，采取轻处罚、重教育的方针，促使商民自动补税，结果收效良好。
    计自动补纳印花、货物、交易等税之商户共二七四户，其中印花、货物税补缴税款共六、八三七、四○五元，交易税小米一○一·二市石，且有自动交出假账者。查获漏税案件，计印花税十五件，税额七九一、○四九元；交易税十八件，税额小米二三·二六市石；货物税九件，税额三、二三九、一七五元；临时营业税三件，税额一二○、○五七元；私烧酒九件，没收酒三一斤；查获假账二二件、一八五本。这些案件均将陆续予以处理。
    由于这次缉查的结果，使四月份各项税款收入均有增加。三月份该县实收税额小米一、一九六·八斤（包括临时营业税、印花税、货物税、交易税与屠宰税），四月份为一、六○四斤，实增四○七·二斤。事实证明，目前工商业呈现暂时困难，以致税收下降，如能加强缉私、防止漏税，完成任务还是具备条件的。但，这次蔚县的稽查在方式上，不少地区尚有强迫命令的现象，极应引起注意。
