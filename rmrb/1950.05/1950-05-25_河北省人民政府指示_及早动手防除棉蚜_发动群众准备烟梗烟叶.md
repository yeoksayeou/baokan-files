　　Hebei Provincial People's Government Instruction:
    Prevent and Control Cotton Aphids Early; Mobilize the Masses to Prepare Tobacco Stalks and Leaves
    [Baoding News] The Hebei Provincial People's Government, in order to vigorously prevent and control cotton aphids, issued a special instruction to governments at all levels, all farms, and all cotton production improvement guidance areas on May 18th. The original text is as follows:
    This year's cotton production task in our province is very large. The capital and labor invested by farmers account for a very large proportion of the total agricultural production. Whether the cotton harvest is good or not directly affects national economic construction and people's livelihood. Therefore, insect prevention and seedling protection are extremely important. According to past experience, cotton aphids are a major enemy of cotton, and they are most likely to occur and cause the most damage in May and June. Therefore, cadres at all levels must, with a high degree of responsibility to the people, raise vigilance, overcome the idea of ​​underestimating and ignoring insect pests, and do a good job in insect control and seedling protection.
    At present, we should seize the season, with farm promotion teams and guidance areas as the center, and cooperate with governments at all levels to hold village-level insect control symposiums in a planned way. Through village cadres, model workers, and production models, combined with local prevention and control experience, teach farmers various effective methods of insect control (local methods, new methods, etc.), and make early preparations for aphid prevention and control work, so as to detect and eliminate them in time. Tobacco water, tobacco leaf small ash water, tobacco leaf lime water, tobacco leaf alkaline water, and cottonseed oil soap water are all simple and effective methods and can be widely promoted. All localities should plan to order and store a certain amount of tobacco powder, tobacco stalks, and cottonseed oil soap from local tobacco factories and cottonseed oil factories, and prepare to introduce them to the masses for purchase (Handan Prefecture has already used this method to order and store 400,000 catties of tobacco stalks). In particular, we should mobilize the masses to prepare some tobacco stalks and leaves themselves. Generally, each mu of cotton field should prepare one and a half catties of tobacco leaves or three catties of tobacco stalks (the area with serious aphid damage last year should be appropriately increased) so that aphids can be immediately controlled when they occur.
    To eliminate aphids, it is necessary to grasp the spirit of "early treatment and organized universal treatment." Recently, aphids have occurred in some areas. Forces should be immediately organized to conduct inspections. Even if there are very few, the masses must be immediately mobilized to eliminate them until they are all eliminated. It is necessary to strictly prevent the paralyzing idea that it does not matter if there are few insects, because aphids reproduce extremely quickly. A little carelessness, and they will develop in large numbers within one or two days due to suitable natural conditions, and even become irreparable. Therefore, we must take the initiative to eliminate them to avoid spreading into disaster.
    In order to conscientiously implement the work of insect control and seedling protection, governments at all levels should establish a strict level-by-level responsibility system from village to county. Once insect pests occur, on the one hand, they should be immediately reported level by level, and on the other hand, the masses should be mobilized and organized to use all possible methods to eliminate them to the best of their ability, ensuring that they are eliminated where they occur and do not spread. The medicines and equipment stored in farms, supply and marketing cooperatives, guidance areas, etc. of each province and county must also be fully utilized, and we must not sit idly by and watch the development of insect pests and leave them idle. We must ensure that we conscientiously do a good job in insect control and seedling protection.

　　河北省人民政府指示
    及早动手防除棉蚜
    发动群众准备烟梗烟叶
    【本报保定讯】河北省人民政府，为大力防除棉蚜，于五月十八日特向各级人民政府、各农场、各棉产改进指导区发出指示，原文如下：
    今年本省棉产任务很大，农民投入的资本和力量在全部农业生产中占有极大比重，棉花收成与否，直接影响国家经济建设和人民生计，因此防虫保苗极为重要。根据历年经验，棉蚜为棉花的大敌，五六月间最易发生，为害也最烈。因此各级干部必须以对人民高度负责的精神，提高警惕，克服轻视与忽视虫害的思想，作好除虫保苗工作。
    目前应即抓紧季节，以农场推广队、指导区为中心，配合各级政府有计划的召开片村除虫座谈会，通过村干、劳模、生产模范，结合当地防除经验，教给农民各种除虫有效办法（土法新法等），及早作好防蚜准备和治蚜工作，以便及时发现及时消灭。烟草水、烟叶小灰水、烟叶石灰水、烟叶碱水及棉油皂水等等，都是简易有效的办法，可大量推行。各地应有计划的向当地烟厂及棉油厂订存一定数量烟末烟梗及棉油皂，准备介绍给群众购用（邯郸专署已用此法订存烟梗四十万斤）。尤应发动群众自己准备一些烟梗烟叶，一般的每亩棉田须备一斤半烟叶或三斤烟梗（去年蚜害严重地区须酌量增加），以便发生蚜虫能立即除治。
    消灭蚜虫必须掌握“早治和组织起来普遍治”的精神。近来各地已有发生蚜虫的地区，应立即组织力量进行检查。即便发生很少，也须马上发动群众除治，直到全部除净为止。要严格防止认为虫子少不要紧的麻痹思想，因为蚜虫繁殖力极大，稍有疏忽，一二日内即会因自然条件的适合，大量发展，甚至不可挽救。因此必须主动除治，以免蔓延成灾。
    为认真贯彻除虫保苗工作，各级政府应建立严格的由村到县的逐级负责制，虫害一经发生，一方面立即逐级上报，一方面发动与组织群众用一切方法尽力所及的予以消灭，保证发生在那里消灭在那里，不使蔓延。各省、县农场与供销社、指导区等所存药械也必须充分利用起来，不得坐视虫害发展，闲置不用，一定要保证认真的作好除虫保苗工作。
