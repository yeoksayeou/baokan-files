Xinhua News Agency, 2nd: The First National Congress of the China Association for Promoting Democracy issued a declaration. The full text is as follows:

　　This association was founded in Shanghai four years ago. At that time, its main task was to jointly oppose the Kuomintang reactionary dictatorship and imperialist aggression with all democratic and patriotic forces, and to adhere to the struggle for democratic revolution and national liberation. Over the past four years, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, the domestic people's revolutionary forces have shown rapid and great development. Now, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang supported by US imperialism has been defeated, and the Chinese people have been freed from the enslavement and oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism. The People's Republic of China has become one of the important fortresses of the world's peace and democracy camp. This glorious victory of the people's revolution has not only changed the historical face of China, but also shifted the entire world situation. The recent signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance has greatly guaranteed the independence and security of the new China and strengthened the world's peace and democracy camp. In such an epoch-making historical environment, it is of new and significant significance that this association is holding a national congress in the people's capital.

　　At the beginning of its establishment, this association stipulated in its charter that our organization "shall be declared terminated upon a proposal and approval by the Congress when the democratic politics is completed." At that time, this truly reflected the enthusiasm of the majority of members who longed for the realization of people's democracy and the completion of the historical mission of this association. However, the current new revolutionary situation indicates that in order to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship and the people's democratic united front, and to implement the people's democratic revolution, all democratic forces today must unite on the basis of the Common Program and continue to strive. As Chairman Mao pointed out in his opening speech at the CPPCC: "Our revolutionary work has not yet been completed, and the People's Liberation War and the People's Revolutionary Movement are still developing. We still need to continue our efforts." It is precisely for this reason that, after serious discussions at this National Congress, we unanimously believe that it is necessary for this association to continue to exist and strengthen its organization. Because this association has existed as an organized force for democratic struggle in the past, it should naturally continue to work as an integral part of the people's democratic united front in the future. In this sense, we have decided to re-formulate the charter and re-deploy our work so that this association can strive for the complete realization of the Common Program of the CPPCC under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and in the battle sequence of the people's democratic united front.

　　This Congress reviewed the past work of this association and deeply felt that there were serious shortcomings such as loose organization and lax work. In order to ensure the sound development of future work, we have decided to work hard to overcome these shortcomings and adopt the following work guidelines:

　　1. Every member of this association must become a loyal supporter, propagandist and executor of the Common Program and all policies and decrees of the People's Government.

　　2. Every member of this association must become an active and responsible member of the people's democratic united front. We should actively strive to unite freelance professionals and people in industry and commerce, so that they can be united under the leadership of the working class, strive for progress, and become useful talents participating in the construction of the new China.

　　3. Actively participate in various construction works. Every comrade should be conscientious and capable in their respective posts, go deep into the masses, and closely integrate with the needs of the broad masses of the people.

　　4. Support and consolidate the permanent friendship and cooperation between China and the Soviet Union, and strive to strengthen and expand the forces for world peace.

　　5. Work hard to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, establish a strong mass perspective and revolutionary perspective, and promote the spirit of democratic centralism in organization and work.

　　These principles must be adhered to and implemented in the work after the meeting in order to complete our historical task.

　　Since the day of its establishment, this association has been under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and has always stood on the side of democracy and progress in arduously carrying out the struggle against the US imperialists and Chiang bandits, and has made considerable contributions to the democratic movement. However, due to its short history and lack of experience, there are still many areas in our work and organization that need to be improved. After this National Congress, we must, on the one hand, carry forward the glorious traditions of the past, and on the other hand, enrich the new content of our work. We call on all members to continuously study, continuously work hard, and steadily move forward in the historical direction indicated by Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party.

　　民主促进会全国代表大会宣言
    【新华社二日讯】中国民主促进会第一届全国代表大会发表宣言，全文如下：
    本会在四年前成立于上海，当时的主要任务，是和一切民主爱国力量共同反对国民党反动独裁和帝国主义侵略，坚持民主革命与民族解放的斗争。四年以来，国内人民革命力量在毛主席和中国共产党领导之下，表现了迅速伟大的发展。现在美帝国主义支持的蒋介石匪帮已经打垮了，中国人民摆脱了帝国主义、封建主义与、官僚资本主义的奴役与压迫，中华人民共和国已经成为世界和平民主阵营的重要堡垒之一。这一人民革命的辉煌胜利，不但改变了中国的历史面貌，同时也转移了整个世界的局势。最近中苏友好互助同盟条约的订立，更大大保障了新中国的独立与安全，增强了世界和平民主阵营。在这样划时代的历史环境中，本会在人民的首都召开全国代表大会，是有新的重大的意义的。
    本会在成立之初，曾在会章上规定，我们的这个组织“至民主政治完成时，经大会提议通过，得宣告结束”。这在当时，的确反映了大多数会员渴望人民民主实现、完成本会历史使命的热情。但是目前新的革命形势指明，为了要巩固人民民主专政与人民民主统一战线，贯彻人民民主主义的革命事业，今天一切民主力量都必须集合在共同纲领的基础上，再接再厉的奋斗下去。诚如毛主席在人民政协开幕词中所指出的：“我们的革命工作还没有完结，人民解放战争和人民革命运动还在继续向前发展，我们还需要继续努力。”正是为了这个理由，我们在这次召集的全国代表大会上经过郑重讨论，一致认为本会有继续存在和加强组织的必要。因为本会在过去曾经作为民主斗争的一个组织力量存在，今后自然更应当作为人民民主统一战线的一个组成部分继续工作。在这个意义之下，我们决定重新制订会章，重新部署工作，使本会能够在中国共产党领导之下，在人民民主统一战线的战斗序列中为彻底实现人民政协共同纲领而奋斗。
    这次代表大会检讨了本会过去的工作，深深的感觉到存在着组织散漫、工作松懈等严重缺点。为着保证今后工作的健全开展，我们决定努力克服这些缺点，采取下列的工作方针：
    一、本会每个会员都必须成为共同纲领和人民政府一切政策、法令忠实的拥护者，宣传者和执行者。
    二、本会每个会员都必须成为人民民主统一战线中积极负责的一分子。应积极地争取团结自由职业者与工商界人士，使他们统一在工人阶级领导下，力求进步，成为参加新中国建设的有用人材。
    三、积极参加各种建设工作，我们每个同志应该在各自的工作岗位上，尽职竭能，深入群众，与广大群众生活的需要密切结合。
    四、拥护和巩固中苏永久友好合作，为加强和扩大世界和平斗争力量而奋斗。
    五、努力学习马列主义毛泽东思想，树立坚强的群众观点与革命观点，发扬组织上和工作上的民主集中精神。
    这些原则必须在会后的工作中坚持下去，贯彻下去，以完成我们的历史任务。
    从本会成立之日，就在中国共产党领导之下，始终站在民主和进步方面艰苦进行反对美帝蒋匪的斗争，在民主运动中，是有相当贡献的。然而，因为历史不久，经验不足，我们的工作和组织还有许多需要改进的地方。经过了这次全国代表大会以后，我们必须一面发扬过去的光荣传统，一面充实新的工作内容。我们号召全体会员不断学习，不断努力工作，朝着毛主席和中国共产党所指示的历史方向稳步前进。
