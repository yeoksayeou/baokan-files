　　Good Results in Tax Preparation Work in Lutai Town
    Tianjin District Completes First Quarter Industrial and Commercial Tax Collection
    [Report from our Tianjin Office] Thanks to the vigorous implementation of the spirit of the national unified new tax law by leading Party and government cadres in Tianjin District and the strengthening of cadre education to correct deviations, the first quarter industrial and commercial tax collection, which began at the end of March and ended on April 25th, not only fulfilled the target of 2,352,000 jin of rice but exceeded it by 464,600 jin. Among them, Ninghe County's Lutai, Fengtai, Junliangcheng, Panzhuang, and Ninghe towns, which have a total of 952 industrial and commercial households, exceeded the first quarter industrial and commercial tax target by 58.3 percent by April 25th. In addition, transaction tax increased by 153 percent compared to March, stamp tax exceeded March by 183 percent, and goods tax exceeded March by 66 percent. This shows that tax evasion has significantly decreased. Of all towns, Lutai Town did the best job in preparation work before the tax collection. The town has more than 460 industrial and commercial households, divided into 37 industries. Before tax collection, a typical survey was conducted on each industry, so after the self-declaration and democratic appraisal began, 422 households in 36 industries were quickly and smoothly appraised. Only the grocery industry, with 40 households, failed to reach an agreement after twelve nights of appraisal due to mutual concealment and exclusion and false self-reporting, all claiming to be "overburdened." Later, after organizing a force for inspection, it was discovered that some businesses in the industry had evaded reporting more than 12 million in business volume. This was immediately exposed at a merchants' meeting, and the merchants claiming overburdening had nothing to say, so the appraisal work was successfully completed.

　　芦台镇征收准备工作成绩较好
    天津专区完成首季工商税
    【本报天津讯】天津专区首季工商税，由于各县党、政领导干部大力贯彻全国统一新税法精神，加强干部教育，纠正偏向，自三月底开始征收至四月二十五日止，除完成二百三十五万二千斤米的任务外，并超过四十六万四千六百余斤。其中所属宁河县，在芦台、丰台、军粮城、潘庄、宁河等镇，计有工商业户九百五十二家，首季工商税至四月二十五日止，即超过任务百分之五十八点三；另外交易税比三月份增加百分之一百五十三，印花税超过三月份百分之一百八十三，货物税超过三月份百分之六十六。这说明了漏税现象已显著减少。各镇在征收前的准备工作，以芦台镇做得最好。该镇共有工商户四百六十余户，共分三十七个行业，在征收前即对各行业进行了典型调查，故在开始自报、民主评议后，不久即顺利完成四百二十二户，计三十六个行业的评议工作。只有杂货业一行四十户，因互相隐瞒排挤、自报不实，经十二个晚上评议均无结果，且都说是“过重”，后经组织力量进行检查，发现该业中有漏报营业额达一千二百多万者，当即在商人大会上予以揭露，该业叫重商户始无话可说，于是评议工作得以顺利完成。
