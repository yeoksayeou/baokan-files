　　Recommend "People's Education" Monthly
　　Edited by People's Education Press, Printed by Xinhua Bookstore

　　The inaugural issue of "People's Education" has been published. This is an educational publication with considerable weight.
　　The "Inaugural Statement" proclaims that the main tasks of "People's Education" are: to study policies, learn from Soviet experiences, summarize the educational experiences of the liberated areas, and launch criticism of educational academic thought. Measured by these four standards, this inaugural issue is quite successful.
　　The opening article is the first section of Qian Junrui's "The Current Direction of Educational Construction," discussing the direction of education serving workers and peasants. The first paragraph thoroughly explains why education should serve workers and peasants, which is sufficient to eliminate the doubts of the general public about this basic direction and establish confidence in serving workers and peasants. The second paragraph explains that the content of the new education must be thoroughly national, scientific, and truly mass-oriented; schools at all levels and all educational institutions should seriously and conscientiously examine their educational content according to the standards of New Democracy education, resolutely and steadily transform the content of teaching, and create new educational content. The third paragraph discusses what kind of deployment should be made for people's education and where to start, listing items such as strengthening the education of worker and peasant cadres and the education of the People's Liberation Army, promoting spare-time literacy education for workers and peasants, preparing to promote literacy education, running worker-peasant quick-course middle schools, and all levels of schools across the country should greatly open their doors to workers, peasants, and their children, making clear explanations item by item.
　　Cheng Jinwu's "Welcoming the Establishment of Worker-Peasant Quick-Course Middle Schools" and Ding Haochuan's "How Teachers Should View Their Work, Students, and Themselves" can be viewed in connection with the first article. The former has very insightful views on the nature of worker-peasant middle schools, as well as issues of enrollment, systems, curriculum, and teaching methods. It particularly emphasizes the need to recognize the characteristics of worker-peasant quick-course middle schools, grasp the spirit and essence of the "Implementation Plan for Worker-Peasant Quick-Course Middle Schools," and avoid deterioration. When discussing curriculum and teaching, it says: the entire curriculum should be cultural courses, and the teaching of political education should mainly permeate the cultural courses; it is necessary to break the concept of balanced development of all subjects, and focus on considering the content of education; the so-called "simplification" does not mean reducing subjects and content, but strengthening certain useful and important parts, and reducing certain useless or less useful parts; the curriculum needs to be concentrated; in teaching, it is necessary to give play to the students' initiative and enthusiasm; it is necessary to study teaching methods, recognize the educational objects, and discuss with students to improve teaching methods, so that students can acquire good learning methods, etc. These opinions are not only applicable to worker-peasant middle schools, but also to ordinary middle schools. In Ding Haochuan's article, it is pointed out that the work of teachers is not simply a "way to make a living," but one of the decisive departments in the entire people's liberation cause; students are new lives that are growing up, and they bear the historical task of building China's New Democracy, socialism, and communism; we must teach them well and be good examples for them; teachers themselves should raise their ideological understanding and work attitude to the appropriate level, and therefore must study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, learn their profession well, constantly summarize experience, improve educational thinking, and improve teaching methods. The entire narrative is quite cordial and full of persuasive power.
　　Wei Que's "What is Education" speaks of the relationship between education and life, the relationship between education and society, and the class nature of education. The text is written so plainly and concretely that readers can gain a correct concept of education from here. Lin Liru's "Problems of Secondary Education" summarizes the most difficult and complex secondary education in our country into two major problems: "The Opposition Between Cultural Education and Vocational Education" and "The Problem of Arts and Sciences Separation" to analyze, pointing out the direction that secondary education in our country should take in the future.
　　Many other articles introduce Soviet educational theories, and some individually solve some specific problems, which are very meaningful to readers.
　　"People's Education," judging from the entire system and content of the "Inaugural Issue," is quite successful. However, the author also has two hopes: one is that in the future, the work of "summarizing the educational experiences of the liberated areas" can be done more systematically and planned. As the "Inaugural Statement" says, in the past twenty years, the education in the old liberated areas has accumulated a lot of experience in the political, military, and cultural education of the troops, in the revolutionary cadre education, rural primary education, farmer political and cultural education, and cadre on-the-job education systems. "These experiences were developed under the guidance of Chairman Mao's thought and in the revolutionary struggle. It is the product of the initial stage of combining Marxism-Leninism with the reality of Chinese education... It completely got rid of the old education track and embarked on serving the people and the country, serving the revolutionary war at that time, giving play to the due role of education, achieving the unity of theory and practice, creating new educational methods, and cultivating new qualities of educational workers." These valuable experiences were obtained from actual struggle and sprouted from the soil of the motherland. Due to the heroic and skillful battles of the People's Liberation Army, the whole country was quickly and basically liberated. Before the national education workers were well prepared, they had to shoulder the arduous task of transforming the old education and building the new education on a national scale. Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, although the general direction of education has been determined step by step, there is still a need for education workers nationwide to work hard in many aspects to effectively transform the correct direction into practical actions. And systematically, vividly, and concretely summarizing the valuable experience of the old liberated areas will inevitably have a powerful inspiration for education workers in all aspects of the country, enabling everyone to have a great influence on the clearing of old educational thoughts and the grasp of new educational theories. Secondly, my country's education, in the process of this new and old transition, the old ideological system is no longer applicable, and the new one has not yet been established, which will make many people feel hesitant and inappropriate; and in fact, the influence of the old ideological system has a long history, and it is not easy to break away from it before a new system is established to replace it. Therefore, it is hoped that "People's Education" will launch criticism of the old educational academic thoughts on the one hand, and at the same time, it can more systematically introduce the new education of the Soviet Union, such as educational principles, teaching and training principles and methods, etc., which everyone is eagerly expecting to understand.
　　Finally, I would like to talk about general education journals. According to statistics, among the existing more than two hundred journals in my country, literature and art ranks first (about forty), and education ranks second. According to the statistics of "People's Education" in April 1950, there are 26 educational magazines in the country. The recently published "Tianjin Education Monthly" in Tianjin and "New Education" edited by Zeng Zhaosen and printed in Guangzhou are not included. From the perspective of the education post, it is of course a good phenomenon that there are many educational publications. But in addition to the quantity, we also require quality. Each publication must be able to receive good results from readers. The author has not read all of the existing educational publications, but from the more than ten that I have read, "People's Education" and "Chinese Educational World" (published by Shanghai Zhonghua Book Company) are national publications. "People's Education" is instructive. If "Chinese Educational World" can do more reporting on national education news, providing supplementary teaching materials for national middle schools, and extracting important articles from national local education magazines, it may be more beneficial to readers. In addition, the introduction of Soviet education theory and methods is also worth doing. In the past, most educational papers in our country were too long, empty, and without substance; and most of them were always turning around at the same level, with very little fresh content. I hope everyone can pay attention to correcting this in the future. Among the local education magazines that I have seen, "Northeast Education" is a more substantial one. It reports on the education policies and guidelines in the Northeast, introduces Soviet education, discusses specific teaching problems, and provides supplementary teaching materials for schools, which are all in line with local needs. Local publications must proceed from the local reality and be targeted at the actual needs of the local area, otherwise it will be shooting without a target, wasting manpower and material resources in vain, and will not be of much benefit to readers.

    《人民教育》创刊号出版了。这是一种有相当分量的教育刊物。
    《发刊辞》揭橥《人民教育》的主要任务在：学习政策，学习苏联的经验，总结解放区的教育经验，展开教育学术思想的批评。拿这四个标准来衡量，这册创刊号是相当成功的。
    卷首是钱俊瑞的“当前教育建设的方针”上节，论教育为工农服务的方针。第一段里透彻地阐明了教育何以要为工农服务的道理，足使一般人消除对这个基本方针的怀疑，树立起为工农服务的信心。第二段说明新教育的内容必须是彻底民族的，科学的，真正的大众的；各级学校和一切教育机构应该根据新民主主义教育的标准，严肃认真地审查自己的教育内容，坚决稳步地改造教学的内容，创造新的教育内容。第三段讲人民教育应作何种部署，从何入手，列举了加强工农干部教育和人民解放军教育，推行工人和农民的业余补习教育，准备推行识字教育，举办工农速成中学，全国各级学校都应大大地为工农及其子女开门等项，逐项作了清楚的说明。
    程今吾的《迎接工农速成中学的创办》和丁浩川的《教师怎样看待自己的工作、学生和自己》两文，可以跟第一篇文章联系起来看。前一篇对于工农中学的性质，以及招生问题、制度、课程、教法，都有极警辟的见解。特别强调要认识工农速成中学的特点，把握住“工农速成中学实施方案”的精神和实质，不要变质。在讲课程和教学时说：全部课程该是文化课程，政治教育的教学主要应渗透在文化课程里；必须打破各科平衡发展的观念，有重点地考虑教育的内容；所谓“精简”，不等于减少科目和内容，而是加强某些有用的重要部分，减少某些无用的或用处较少的部分；课程需要集中；在教学中要发挥学生的自觉性、积极性；要研究教学方法，认清教育对象，和学生一同讨论改进教学方法，使学生自己获得良好的学习方法等等。这些意见，不但适用于工农中学，同样适于普通中学。丁浩川的文章里，指出了教师工作不单纯是“谋生之道”，而是整个人民解放事业中具有决定意义的工作部门之一；学生是正在成长中的新生命，他们身上负担着建设中国新民主主义、社会主义和共产主义的历史任务；我们要好好教导他们，做他们的好榜样；教师自己该把思想认识和工作态度提到应有水平，因此必须学习马列主义和毛泽东思想，学好业务，不断总结经验，提高教育思想，改进教学方法。通篇叙述颇为亲切，富于说服的力量。
    韦悫的《教育是什么》，从教育与生活的关系、教育与社会的关系讲到教育的阶级性，文字写得那么平易具体，读者从这里可以获得教育的正确概念。林砺儒的《中等教育问题》，把向来疑难最多最复杂的我国中等教育，归纳为《文化教育与职业教育之对立》与《文理分科问题》两大症结来加以剖析，指出了今后我国中等教育所应走的方向。
    其他的许多篇文字，有的介绍了苏联的教育理论，有的个别解决了若干具体的问题，对读者都是很有意义的。
    《人民教育》，从《创刊号》的整个体制和内容看来，是相当成功了的。但是笔者还有两个希望：一是希望以后对“总结解放区的教育经验”的工作，能够更有系统有计划地来做。正如《发刊辞》中所说，二十多年来老解放区的教育，在部队的政治、军事、文化教育上，在革命干部教育、农村小学教育、农民政治文化教育及干部在职教育等系统上，都积蓄了很多经验。“这些经验是在毛主席的思想指导下，在革命斗争中锻炼出来的，它是马列主义和中国教育实际结合的最初阶段的产物……它却完全摆脱了旧教育的轨道，走上一切为人民、为国家服务，为当时革命战争服务，发挥了教育应有的作用，做到理论与实际的一致，创造了新的教育方法，培养了新的教育工作者的新品质。”这些宝贵经验，是从实际斗争中得来的，是从祖国的泥土里萌发出来的。由于人民解放军的英勇善战，很迅速地基本上解放了全国，全国教育工作者在没有很好的准备之前，就得担负起在全国范围内改造旧教育与建设新教育的艰巨任务来。在中国共产党和人民政府正确领导之下，教育的大方针虽然已经在一步一步确定下来，可是要把正确的方针有效地转化为实际行动，还有待全国教育工作者多方面来努力。而把老解放区的宝贵经验，系统地生动具体地总结出来，对全国各方面教育工作者必然会发生有力的启示，使大家在对旧教育思想的廓清和新教育理论的把握上起莫大的影响的。其次是我国的教育，在这新旧递邅的过程中，旧思想体系不再适用了，新的却还没有建立起来，这会使许多人有彷徨莫适之感；而事实上，旧的思想体系的影响有它长远的历史，在没有新体系来代替之前，是不容易挣脱的。因此希望《人民教育》一面展开对旧教育学术思想的批评，同时更能较有系统地来介绍苏联的新教育，如教育原理，教学及训练的原理原则和方法等，都是大家迫切地在期望了解的。
    最后，附带谈谈一般教育期刊。据统计在我国现有二百多种期刊中，以文艺占第一位（约有四十多种），第二位就是教育。《人民教育》中一九五○年四月的统计，全国共有教育杂志二十六种，天津新近出版的《天津教育月刊》，和曾昭森主编在广州印行的《新教育》，还不在内。从教育的岗位来看，教育刊物多，当然是好现象。可是除了量多之外，我们还要求质精，每一种刊物对读者都要能收良好的效果。现有的教育刊物，笔者没有全部看过，就看过的十多种说，《人民教育》和《中华教育界》（上海中华书局刊行）都是属于全国性的刊物。《人民教育》是具有指导性的。《中华教育界》今后如能多做一些全国教育消息的报导，全国中学补充教材的提供和全国地方教育杂志重要文章的摘粹之类的工作，这样对读者也许更为有益。此外如苏联教育理论与方法的介绍，也是值得做的。过去我国一般教育论文，大多嫌冗长空泛，言之无物；而且大多老是在同一水平上转圈子，很少新鲜的内容，希望今后大家能够注意加以矫正。地方性教育杂志，就我所见到的，《东北教育》是较充实的一种。它报导东北教育方针政策，介绍苏联教育，讨论教学具体问题，提供学校补充教材，都是切合地方需要用的。地方性刊物必须从地方的实际出发，针对地方的实际需要，否则便是无的放矢，徒然浪费人力物力，对读者并没有多大裨益。
