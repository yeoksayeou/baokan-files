Xinhua News Agency Report: The Yanchang Petroleum Plant relies on workers to overcome difficulties and improve technical equipment, gradually increasing its refining capacity. After being liberated in 1935, the plant was under long-term reactionary blockade by the Kuomintang, making it extremely difficult to replenish equipment and materials. Workers demonstrated high creativity in overcoming fuel difficulties and self-manufacturing oil boilers, steam boilers, and oil pipes.

In 1943, the plant launched the Zhao Zhankui movement, and the enthusiasm of employees for production soared. In order to increase the refining speed, engineer Xu Wenjie worked with workers to study solutions and finally found that the reason for the slow refining time in the past was the fear of fire when discharging hot heavy oil, resulting in more than a day of cooling time. Therefore, they tried to put the hot heavy oil into a large amount of cold heavy oil, which not only prevented fire but also saved time, thus shortening the refining process from three days per pot to one day per pot, increasing the monthly refining capacity by more than four times.

In 1946, the plant accepted the task given by the government to increase gasoline production and began to study heavy oil cracking. Engineer Xu Wenjie, considering that the heavy oil distillation pot in the plant also experienced decomposition when distilling diesel, producing a small amount of gasoline due to the high boiling point of heavy oil, worked with workers to study and devise ways to reduce the firepower and extend the decomposition distillation time in order to obtain more gasoline. However, after the distillation time was extended, the amount of carbon residue increased accordingly, settling at the bottom of the pot, hindering heat transfer, and causing the bottom of the pot to deform and easily break due to excessive heat. After worker Zheng Wenzhen pointed out this situation, Engineer Xu, based on the worker's suggestion, devised a method to heat from the side of the pot instead of heating at the bottom of the pot. In this way, although the carbon residue settled at the bottom of the pot, it did not hinder heat transfer, so the distillation time could be extended smoothly, and the gasoline production rate was increased. In 1948, heavy oil cracking was officially implemented, and the gasoline production rate increased by nearly 69% compared with the past, while the kerosene production rate also increased by 30%.

In 1949, Engineer Xu, in cooperation with riveter Wu Zhizhong and others, made a larger heavy oil pot. With the suggestion of worker Gao Shaomei, a fractionation tower was added to use waste smoke to heat cold heavy oil, thereby cracking a large amount of heavy oil and diesel, increasing the production rate of gasoline and kerosene by 13% compared with 1948. The gradual increase in the refining capacity of the plant, especially the gradual increase in the production rate of gasoline and kerosene, substantially supplied the military and civilian needs of the liberated areas. In 1948, when the People's Liberation Army was pursuing and annihilating the fleeing Chiang Kai-shek bandit troops, in order to ensure military transportation, producing one more barrel of gasoline saved 80 units of human and animal power, greatly reducing the burden on the people in the border areas who had suffered from the Chiang Kai-shek banditry, which was of particular significance.

The reason why the plant has been able to continuously overcome difficulties, improve technical equipment, and increase refining capacity is that leading cadres and engineering and technical personnel rely on workers everywhere and implement democratic management. All production plans and engineering and technical improvement matters are communicated and discussed from top to bottom at joint meetings of Communist Party, administrative, and trade union cadres at all levels, down to trade union group meetings, to solicit workers' opinions extensively. As a result, workers feel that they are the masters of the factory, their enthusiasm for production is enhanced, they formulate specific implementation methods on their own, and they ensure their implementation. Leading cadres and engineering and technical personnel can learn from workers at any time in their daily work, gain inspiration, and improve their work. An especially important factor is that the plant has vigorously cultivated worker cadres over the years. The current factory director, director of the repair department, chief of the engineering section, and production managers of various departments are all workers, which enables the technical knowledge of administrative cadres and engineering and technical personnel to be better combined with the practical experience of workers. However, the plant's management committee is not yet sound. Although the chairman of the trade union participates, it does not include workers equal in number to the other members of the committee, as stipulated by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and the workers' representative meeting is not held regularly. If the management committee organization can be improved in the future and the workers' representative meeting can be fully utilized to promote democracy more systematically, the results will inevitably be even greater.

Although the scale of the Yanchang Petroleum Plant is not large, its experience in relying on workers, overcoming difficulties, and improving technical equipment, especially the combination of engineering and technical personnel and workers, is worthy of learning by staff of other newly liberated oil plants.

### 技术人员与工人共同研究改进设备  延长石油厂炼油能力逐步提高

　　技术人员与工人共同研究改进设备
    延长石油厂炼油能力逐步提高
    【本报讯】据新华社讯：延长石油厂依靠工人，克服困难，改进技术设备，炼油能力逐步提高。该厂于一九三五年解放后，曾长期处在国民党反动封锁下，各项设备与器材的补给极为困难。工人们曾在克服燃料困难，自制炼油锅、蒸汽锅、油管方面发挥了高度的创造力。
    一九四三年，该厂展开赵占魁运动，职工生产情绪高涨，工程师徐文杰为了提高炼油速度，曾与工人共同研究办法，终于找出过去炼油时间迟缓的原因，是因为热重油放出时怕着火，而用一天多的冷却时间。于是他们就设法将热重油放入大量冷重油中，既不着火，又不误时，这样就使炼油过程由三天一锅缩短至一天一锅，每月炼油能力提高四倍还多。
    一九四六年，该厂接受政府给予提高汽油产量的任务，开始研究重油裂化工作。工程师徐文杰鉴于该厂重油蒸溜锅蒸溜柴油时，因重油沸点高，亦有分解现象，产生少量汽油，乃就此基础，和工人共同研究，设法将火力减少，延长分解蒸溜时间，以多得汽油。但蒸溜时间延长后，炭渣却因之加多，沉淀锅底，妨碍传热，锅底因热度过大而变形，而且易坏。经工人郑文珍指出这一情况，徐工程师又根据工人启示，设法不在锅底加热，而改从锅侧加热。这样一来，炭渣虽沉淀于锅底，也不妨碍传热，因而蒸溜时间得以顺利延长，汽油生产率从而提高。一九四八年，重油裂化正式实行，汽油生产率即因之比过去提高百分之六十九弱，同时煤油生产率亦随之增加百分之三十。
    一九四九年，徐工程师更与铆工吴志中等合作，制成一较大之重油锅，并经工人高少美建议，增设分溜塔，利用废烟余热加热冷重油，从而大量裂化重油、柴油，使汽油与煤油生产率较一九四八年又提高百分之十三。该厂炼油能力的逐步提高，尤其汽油与煤油生产率的逐步提高，相当供给了解放区军需民用。一九四八年，当解放军追歼溃逃蒋胡匪军时，为保证军需运输，多产一桶汽油即节省人畜力各八十个，大大减轻饱受蒋胡匪侵害后的边区人民负担，其意义尤属重大。
    该厂所以能不断克服困难、改进技术设备、提高炼油能力，是由于领导干部与工程技术人员处处依靠工人，实行民主管理的结果。举凡生产计划、工程技术改进事项等，均自上而下逐级召开共产党、行政、工会干部联席会，直至工会小组会，进行传达与讨论，广泛征求工人意见，因而工人感觉自己是工厂的主人，生产积极性提高，自行制定具体实行办法，并保证其实行。领导干部与工程技术人员能于日常工作中随时向工人学习，获得启示，改进工作。尤其重要的一个因素，是该厂多年来大力培养了工人干部，现任厂长与修理部主任、工务科长、各部生产管理员等均为工人出身，这就使行政干部、工程技术人员的技术智识与工人的实际经验更好的结合起来。但是，该厂管理委员会尚不健全，其中虽有工会主任参加，但并未按照全国总工会规定包括与该会其他委员数量相等之工人，职工代表会亦未经常召开。今后如能健全管委会组织，充分运用职工代表会，更有系统地发扬民主，其成效就必然更大。
    按延长石油厂规模虽然不大，但其依靠工人、克服困难、改进技术设备的经验，尤其工程技术人员与工人结合一点，是值得其他新解放的石油厂工作人员学习的。
