　　The Bulwark of Peace is as Strong as Steel
    Wang Youcai and thirteen other farmers from Landian Village outside Beijing's western suburbs signed their names and wrote a short song: "...Mountains connect to water, trees connect to roots; the people of the whole world are of one heart and mind. Unite, and our strength will be great; the bulwark of peace is as strong as steel. Acheson will be scared out of his wits when he hears it, and Truman will be even more terrified when he hears it!..."
    Zong Chongren, a working person from Beijing, not only signed his name but also wrote a rhythmic clapper talk about the peace signature campaign: "Clapper beats, let's speak slowly; people across the country, please listen carefully; American imperialists collude with reactionaries, using the atomic bomb to deceive us; reactionary leaders and running dogs are inciting rumors everywhere. We must not be deceived by them, quickly unite and sign our names. The power of peace is strong and great; the warmongers are doomed; from now on, eliminate wars of aggression; world peace will bring security to the people."
    Forty-five reformed prisoners from the Labor Brigade of the Xiahua Garden Xintong Coal Mine in Zhangjiakou City wrote in a letter: "Because we were influenced by the old society, we unintentionally made mistakes. We are twelve thousand times grateful to the People's Government for giving us education, so that we can live a happy life in the future. But the warmongers, headed by American imperialism, are preparing for a new war, plotting to use atomic weapons to massacre humanity on a large scale. For ourselves and the people of the world, we resolutely oppose them. In addition to participating in the peace signature campaign, we are determined to intensify our labor production, dedicate all our strength, and take practical action to defend world peace."

　　和平的堡垒钢铁一样坚
    北京西郊外蓝靛村王有才等十三位农民签了名，并写了一首短歌：“……山连水，树连根；全世界的人民心连心。团结起来力量大，和平的堡垒钢铁一样坚。艾奇逊听了吓破胆，杜鲁门听了更心惊。……”
    北京市劳动人民宗崇仁签了名还写了一首和平签名快板：“竹板打，慢开言；全国人民请细听；美帝勾结反动派，利用原子弹欺骗咱；反动头子和走狗，各地煽动造谣言。我们休要受他骗，团结快快把名签。和平力量强又大，战争贩子要完蛋；从此消灭侵略战，世界和平人民安。”
    张家口市监狱驻下花园信通煤窑劳动大队四十五名自新人来信说：“我们因为受了旧社会的薰染，曾有意无意的犯了错误，我们十二万分的感激人民政府给予我们的教育，使我们将来能过幸福快乐的日子。而以美帝国主义为首的战争贩子们竟在准备新战争，图以原子武器来大规模残杀人类，我们为了自己和全世界的人民，坚决反对他们，除参加和平签名外，决加紧劳动生产，献出全部力量，以实际行动保卫世界和平。”
