　　The Chinese Working Class Struggles for the Restoration, Consolidation, and Development of New China's Industry
    ——Striving for Our Permanent Happiness and Winning Lasting Peace in the East
    Liu Ningyi
    The Chinese people have achieved a fundamental victory in the cause of national liberation. The enemies on the Chinese mainland have been wiped out, and the people of the vast countryside and cities have been liberated, turning themselves into masters of their own destiny, facing the great task of building a new China—transforming a backward China into an advanced China, an agricultural China into an industrial China, and a poor and weak China into an independent, democratic, peaceful, unified, and prosperous China.

    The leading class of the New China—the working class—has emerged with a sense of ownership, implementing the economic and labor movement policies of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, the leader of the Chinese people: "Taking into account both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, assisting each other between urban and rural areas, and promoting internal and external exchanges" to restore, consolidate, and develop China's industry. To implement policies more correctly and effectively, the working class of New China must first consolidate and strengthen its ranks. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, at its labor union work conference in August 1949, called on workers nationwide to organize. It mobilized labor movement cadres across the country, faced the broad masses of workers, fully utilized the assistance provided by our new democratic regime, boldly mobilized the masses, and carried out organizational work. To date, in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Harbin, Tangshan, Wuhan, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Xuzhou, Taiyuan... and in important industries such as railways, textiles, coal mines, hardware, military industries, chemicals, postal and telecommunications, seafarers, docks, electricity, and printing, over 50% of workers are organized, and in some cases, it has reached 80-90%. In addition, trade union organizations for shops and handicrafts have also been widely established.

    The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has established a nationwide, systematic, sound, and unified organization, with four million members. It has established national industry-wide trade unions for railways, seafarers, postal and telecommunications, and porters. It is preparing to establish seven major national industry-wide trade unions for hardware, coal mining, food, textiles, military industries, machinery, and shop employees in the near future. This trade union organization is a unified organization formed in accordance with the principles of democracy and voluntarism, according to the industrial organization system, regardless of gender, age, origin, ethnicity, religion, or belief. It has completely broken away from the non-unified phenomenon of guilds during the Kuomintang's rule, and has formed a unified, organized, led, democratically centralized, orderly, and powerful force.

    Why are we organized? To ensure that we can shoulder our responsibilities well. The status of being masters of the country is a glorious status, but also a most responsible one. Therefore, learning to manage the country and learning production management are already urgent tasks for our working class. Because China has long been oppressed and exploited by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, the vast rural areas have suffered severe damage, and bureaucratic capitalist factories in the cities were tools used by imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism to oppress and exploit the Chinese working class and the people. Today, although China has been liberated, land reform in the newly liberated areas has not yet been completed, the vast number of peasants have not yet escaped poverty, factory machinery and equipment are damaged and insufficient, raw materials are lacking, funds are scarce, and the set of management methods, wage systems, and production organization left over by bureaucratic capital in the enterprise departments is extremely corrupt. Moreover, coupled with the blockade and bombing by U.S. imperialism and the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, there are still serious difficulties in production. Our working class must carry forward our consistent hard work, glorious revolutionary tradition, and display our strong perseverance, high sense of responsibility, and creativity to break the blockade, overcome difficulties, and get through this difficult final year of 1950.

    As soon as we were liberated, we assisted the government in protecting factories, carrying out inventory and takeover, so that the factories and enterprises of bureaucratic capital were completely transferred into the hands of the people, became the property of the people and the country, and produced for the happiness of the people; and laid the foundation for the future development of the socialist economy. Our trade unions assisted the enterprise management departments in transforming the old management and administration policies, adopted a democratic management system, relied on the broad masses of workers, promoted the labor enthusiasm of the working class, and restored and consolidated factories, enterprises, and transportation.

    Our railway workers responded to the call of "Where the People's Liberation Army fights, the railway extends there," and quickly restored the severely damaged national railway transportation. In 1949 alone, 8,200 kilometers of railway were repaired, exceeding the original plan by more than double. By the end of 1949, of the 24,794 kilometers that had been liberated, 21,046 kilometers had returned to normal traffic.

    In factories and mines, under the leadership of trade unions, workers launched a movement to donate equipment. Workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant near Beijing donated 5,000 tons of steel materials, over 10 million machine parts, and over 3.5 million refractory bricks of over 540 types. Workers at the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant donated over 212,400 pieces of various large and small machine parts, worth 2.483 billion Northeast Renminbi. Workers at the Fushun Coal Mine in the Northeast donated various industrial equipment worth over 7 billion Northeast Renminbi. This greatly helped the restoration of factories and mines.

    In order to transform enterprise production management and production organization, trade unions mobilized the broad masses of workers, assisted the administration in implementing factory management democratization, and universally organized worker representative conferences in factories. Factory management committees led by factory directors and participated by worker and staff representatives were established in 987 important factories and mines across the country. This strengthened the workers' sense of being masters of the country, greatly promoted their labor enthusiasm and creativity, consolidated conscious labor discipline, increased labor productivity, reduced production costs, and improved product quality.

    In the Northeast, which was liberated earliest, land reform has been thoroughly completed, industry has been largely restored, and it has embarked on the road to development. In the second half of 1949, under the call and leadership of the Communist Party, the government, and the trade union, a mass movement to create new records was launched. In the five months up to March of this year, a total of 19,940 new records, both individual and collective, were created, with over 50,000 creators. This movement has developed from individual new records to collective new records, and from simply increasing labor intensity to improving technical operations, production safety, inventions, and creations. This has greatly increased labor productivity: according to statistics from October to December, the average labor productivity during this period increased by 13% compared to September, and the labor productivity in December was 32.83% higher than in June. As a result, the total value of industrial production in the Northeast in 1949 exceeded the original plan by 4.2%. In the past year, the number of people employed in state-owned industries increased by 240,000, and the actual wages of workers and staff also increased by an average of 27%. Currently, workers in the Northeast are striving to complete and exceed the new plan for 1950, which will increase the total value of industrial production in the Northeast to 193% of that in 1949, increasing the proportion of industrial production in the total production value of the Northeast from 35% in 1949 to about 43%.

    In North China, industrial production has also gradually gotten on track, and new production records continue to emerge. For example, workers at the Northwest Steel Plant in Taiyuan gave full play to their production enthusiasm and creativity, accepted the technical guidance of Soviet experts, and created the glorious record of increasing steel production by a quarter compared to the period of Japanese puppet rule.

    The workers in East China and Shanghai stand today on the front lines of liberating Taiwan, suffering from the blockade and bombing by U.S. imperialism and the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The working class, who have become masters of the country, have highly displayed their glorious revolutionary tradition and are carrying out the struggle against bombing and blockade, stepping up production to support the People's Liberation Army and complete the task of liberating Taiwan as soon as possible.

    In addition, in the newly liberated cities of Central South, Southwest, and Northwest China, workers have also completed the takeover tasks and are carrying out the consolidation and transformation of production.

    In private enterprises, our local trade union organizations lead the masses of workers to learn how to correctly grasp the policy of "benefiting both labor and capital," fundamentally changing the past situation of benefiting only capital, proactively using methods of negotiation, arbitration, and legal resolution to protect the interests of the masses of workers, adjust labor-capital relations, and achieve the goal of developing production and prospering the economy.

    It cannot be denied that we still have many difficulties and our experience is still insufficient. As Chairman Mao said, we are only at the "first step of the Long March." However, we have the conditions to overcome these difficulties. We have a large, resource-rich, populous, and unified country; we have the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao; we have the experience of the working class in overcoming difficulties over many years; we have the unity and consciousness of the working class and people of the whole country; and, moreover, we have the advanced experience and assistance of the Soviet working class. We have already striven for the initial improvement of the financial and economic situation, and we can also restore in three to five years and build in eight to ten years, manage industry well, and move from new democracy to socialism.

    Our working class and people across the country have annihilated millions of Kuomintang bandit troops, completely foiling the US$600 million loan and various aid given by U.S. imperialism to the Chiang bandits. U.S. imperialism and its running dog, Chiang Kai-shek, still dream of holding on to Taiwan and increasing our difficulties with economic blockades and wanton air raids. Now, our workers across the country are tightening their belts, stepping up production, and actively preparing to liberate Taiwan, using the strength of the national victory to overcome temporary difficulties. Victory is absolutely certain.

    Our struggle is just, upright, and has won the support of the people across the country, and has won today's brilliant achievements. Our struggle has struck at the common enemy of mankind—the U.S. imperialists—and has won the support of peace-loving, democratic, and advanced people all over the world. We have first won the assistance of the Soviet Union and signed an unbreakable Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance with the Soviet Union, which has provided a strong guarantee for China's construction and has given invincible strength to peace in the Far East and the world. Following this, the people's democratic countries formed a consolidated and powerful camp. This has laid a victorious future for our economic development. Coupled with the solidarity of our oppressed working class brothers in various countries and the echo of the anti-imperialist struggles of various oppressed nations, the Chinese working class has full confidence in winning its own happiness, building a prosperous and strong New China, and winning lasting peace in the East.

　　中国工人阶级为新中国的工业恢复整顿与发展而斗争
    ——争取自己的永久幸福，赢得东方的持久和平
    刘宁一
    中国人民已经取得了全国解放事业的基本胜利。中国大陆上的敌人被肃清了，广大的乡村与城市的人民，获得了解放，翻身做了主人，面向着新中国建设的伟大任务——将落后的中国，变为前进的中国，将农业的中国，变为工业的中国；将贫弱的中国变为独立，民主，和平，统一和富强的中国。
    新中国的领导阶级——工人阶级，以主人翁自觉的态度出现，执行了中国共产党和中国人民的领袖毛泽东主席的经济和工运政策，“公私兼顾，劳资两利，城乡互助，内外交流”来恢复、整顿与发展中国的工业。为了执行政策更加正确而有力量，新中国的工人阶级，首先要巩固和壮大自己的队伍。中华全国总工会于一九四九年八月的工会工作会议上，号召全国工人组织起来。它动员了全国的工运干部，面向着广大的工人群众，充分运用我新民主主义政权给我们的帮助，放手发动群众，进行组织工作。至今，在北京、上海、天津、沈阳、哈尔滨、唐山、武汉、无锡、杭州、徐州、太原……各大城市中，在铁路、纺织、煤矿、五金、军工、化学、邮电、海员码头、电力、印刷，各重要产业中，有组织的工人已达百分之五十以上，有的到了百分之八九十，此外，商店，手工业工会组织也普遍的建立起来了。
    中华全国总工会已建立了全国系统的健全的统一组织，拥有四百万会员，在全国范围内成立了铁路、海员、邮电与搬运产业总工会正在准备于最近成立全国五金、煤矿、食品、纺织、军工、机器、店员七大产业总工会。这一工会组织是依照民主自愿的原则，依照产业组织系统，不分性别、年龄、籍贯、民族、宗教、信仰的统一组织。完全破除了国民党统治时期行会分裂的不统一现象，而形成了统一的，有组织的，有领导的，民主集中的，整齐而强大的队伍。
    我们组织起来为了什么呢？为了使我们的责任能够很好的负担起来。国家主人翁的地位是光荣的地位，但也是最负责任的地位。因此，学会当家作主人，学会生产管理，已经是我们工人阶级当前迫切的任务。由于中国长期被帝国主义，封建主义，官僚资本主义所压迫和剥削，广大的农村遭到严重的破坏，城市里的官僚资本工厂是帝国主义，官僚资本主义用以压迫、剥削中国工人阶级和人民的工具。今天，中国虽然解放了，可是新解放区的土地改革尚未完成，广大的农民仍未脱离贫困的境遇，工厂机器的设备残破不足，原料缺乏，资金困难，企业部门中官僚资本遗留下来的一套管理方法，工资制度，生产组织又是腐败非常，再加以美帝国主义，蒋介石匪帮残余的封锁、轰炸，故目前生产上还存在着严重的困难。我们工人阶级，必须发扬我们一贯的吃苦耐劳，光荣的革命传统，发挥我们坚强的毅力，高度的责任心和创造性，打破封锁，克服困难，渡过一九五○年这困难最后的一年。
    当我们一经解放，我们就协助政府保护工厂，进行清点接管，使官僚资本的工厂企业，完整的转入人民之手，成为人民和国家的财产，为人民的幸福而生产；并且为社会主义经济的发展前途奠下了基础。我们的工会协助企业管理部门改造了旧的经营与管理方针，采用了民主管理制度，依靠广大的工人群众，发扬了工人阶级的劳动热忱，恢复和整顿了工厂、企业和交通。
    我们的铁路工人响应了“解放军打到那里铁路修到那里”的号召，迅速地修复了破坏不堪的全国铁路交通。在一九四九年一年之内，即修复了八千二百公里的铁道，超过了原来计划的一倍以上。到一九四九年年底为止，已解放的二四、七九四公里中，就有二一、○四六公里恢复正常交通。
    在工厂和矿山上，工人在工会的领导之下，发动了献纳器材的运动。北京近郊石景山钢铁厂的工人曾献出了五千吨钢铁材料，机器零件一千余万件，耐火砖五四○多种，三五○余万块。鞍山钢铁厂的工人捐献了大小机件二十一万二千四百余件，价值东北人民币二十四亿八千三百万。东北抚顺煤矿的工人，曾献出各种工业用器材价值东北人民币七十余亿元。对于厂矿的修复给了极大的帮助。
    为了改造企业的生产管理和生产组织，工会发动了广大的工人群众，协助行政实行工厂管理民主化，在工厂中普遍地组织了工人代表会议，在全国九百八十七个重要的厂矿中，建立了以厂长为领导的由工人和职员代表参加的工厂管理委员会。因此加强了工人群众国家主人翁的感觉，大大地发扬了他们的劳动热忱和创造性，巩固了自觉的劳动纪律，提高了劳动生产率，减低了生产成本，提高了产品质品。
    在解放最早的东北，土地改革已彻底完成，工业已大体恢复，并走上了发展的道路。一九四九年下半年，在共产党、政府和工会的号召和领导之下，展开了群众性的创造新纪录运动。迄今年三月为止的五个月中共创造了个人和集体的新纪录一九、九四○件，创造者五万余人。这个运动由个人的新纪录发展到集体的新纪录，由单纯提高劳动强度的新纪录发展到改进技术操作、生产保安及发明创造的新纪录。因此大大提高了劳动生产率：若以十至十二月份的数字统计，则这一时期的平均劳动生产率即比九月份提高了百分之十三，而十二月份的劳动生产率要比六月份高百分之三二·八三。其结果使东北一九四九年全年工业生产的总值超过了原计划的百分之四·二。去年一年之内在公营工业就业的人数增加了二四万人，而工人和职员的实际工资也平均提高了百分之二十七。目前东北的工人正在为完成和超过完成一九五○年的新计划而斗争着，这个计划将提高东北工业生产总值等于一九四九年的百分之一九三，使工业生产的比重在东北生产总值中自一九四九年的百分之三十五增加到百分之四十三左右。
    在华北，工业生产也已逐渐走上轨道，生产新纪录不断出现。例如：太原西北炼钢厂的工人发挥了生产积极性和创造性，接受了苏联专家的技术指导，创造了钢铁产量较日伪统治时期增加四分之一的光荣纪录。
    华东和上海的工人今天站在解放台湾的最前线，遭受到美帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮残余的封锁和轰炸。作了国家主人的工人阶级，高度发挥了他们光荣的革命传统，正在进行着反轰炸，反封锁的斗争，加紧生产支持人民解放大军，早日完成解放台湾的任务。
    此外，在中南、西南、西北新解放区的城市中，工人也已完成了接管任务，正在进行生产的整顿和改造。
    在私人企业中，我们各地的工会组织领导工人群众学会正确的掌握“劳资两利”的政策，即根本改变了过去资方一利的状况，主动地运用了协商、谈判、仲裁、依法解决的办法，来保护工人群众的利益，调整劳资关系，达到发展生产，繁荣经济的目的。
    不能否认，我们的困难还很多，我们的经验还不够，正如毛主席所说还仅限于“万里长征第一步”，但是，我们已具备了克服这些困难的条件，我们有一个地大、物博、人多而统一的国家；有中国共产党毛主席的英明领导；有工人阶级多年克服困难的经验；有全国工人阶级和人民的团结与觉悟；更加我们有苏联工人阶级的先进经验与帮助。我们已经争取了财政经济情况的开始好转，我们同样能够三年五年恢复，八年十年建设，管好了工业，经过新民主主义而走到社会主义。
    我全国工人阶级和人民，已经将全国几百万国民党匪军歼灭，使美帝国主义给蒋匪六十万万美元的借款，和各种支援完全失败，美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石还梦想孤守台湾，以经济封锁，飞机肆虐，增加我们的困难。现在我全国工人正在节衣缩食，加紧生产，积极准备解放台湾，以全国的胜利的力量来克服暂时的困难。胜利是绝对有把握的。
    我们的斗争是正义的，是光明磊落的，获得了全国人民的支持，获得了今天的辉煌战果。我们的斗争是打击了世界人类的共同敌人——美帝国主义者，获得了全世界爱好和平民主先进人类的支持。我们首先获得了苏联的援助，和苏联订立了牢不可破的友好同盟互助条约，使中国的建设获得了有力的保障，使远东和世界和平获得了无敌的力量。紧接着各人民民主国家结成了巩固的，强大阵营。使我们的经济发展，奠定了胜利的前程。又加各国被压迫工人阶级兄弟的声援，各被压迫民族的反帝斗争的呼应，中国工人阶级有充分的信心，能够赢得自己的幸福，建立富强的新中国，赢得东方的持久和平。（按：此稿为英文半月刊《人民中国》而作）
