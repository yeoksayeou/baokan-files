　　Financial News in Brief

　　Tianjin County's industrial and commercial tax was completed on schedule and exceeded the original target. After receiving instructions from the special commissioner's office to ensure the task was completed on schedule by April 20th, the county held an emergency meeting of district and section chiefs on the 10th to clarify the responsibilities of district and section chiefs in tax collection work. They also discussed in detail the specific steps and practices to be implemented, and conducted a thorough ideological mobilization of all cadres, correcting the idea of underestimating tax revenue. After four days of assessment and three days of preparation for payment, the county collected 470,000 jin of millet, exceeding the original target by 50,000 jin.
　　
　　Yuan Zhenqing, manager of the Daxinglong Grocery Store on West Gate Street in Zhengzhou City, evaded taxes amounting to 25,033,600 yuan from December of last year to January of this year. The evaded taxes included taxes on superstitious goods, industrial and commercial goods tax, and stamp tax. Yuan purchased goods with the evaded tax money and stored them, creating three fake account books to cover up his actions. The tax bureau discovered this in early March and transferred the case to the court for handling. After interrogation, the court sentenced him on April 10th to pay the original tax amount, plus a penalty of twice the amount of the evaded tax, totaling over 50 million yuan. He was also sentenced to two months of detention and ordered to pay the fine in two installments within 20 days.
