The Director of the Tianjin Steel Fittings Factory of the Ministry of Railways
Refuses to Accept Workers' Criticism

[This newspaper report] According to a Workers' Daily report: Xing Xiaoxian, the director of the Tianjin Steel Fittings Factory No. 1 of the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, refused to accept the correct opinions reflected by Yang Enqing, a worker in the factory (originally published in the Workers' Daily on April 25). He did not earnestly examine his own shortcomings, and he spoke with Wang Yuan, a reporter from the Workers' Daily, and Yang Enqing, a worker from the factory, expressing strong dissatisfaction with the newspaper's public criticism of the factory. This attitude of directly resisting the Party Central Committee's "Decision on Launching Criticism and Self-Criticism in Newspapers and Publications" is extremely wrong. There are many problems in the factory, showing that the administration is detached from the masses. The Party branch has abandoned leadership; the work of the trade union has completely stopped; the management committee has become a mere formality; and the sanitary facilities are extremely poor. In order to improve the work of the factory, Yang Enqing had successively raised opinions to the factory director, the trade union director, and members of the management committee. But there were no results. On April 17, Yang Enqing reflected these situations to the Workers' Daily, requesting the higher-level trade union to pay attention and help rectify the work. Yang Enqing's attitude and practice of cherishing the factory and being serious and responsible are completely correct. After receiving the letter, the Workers' Daily sent reporters to the factory twice to conduct in-depth investigations, proving that the situation reflected by the correspondent basically conformed to the facts. The newspaper then published Yang Enqing's article on April 25. The factory leaders not only did not humbly accept opinions and actively improve their work, but instead took their anger out on the worker correspondent and the reporter. On May 2, they spoke with Wang Yuan, a reporter from the Workers' Daily, and Yang Enqing, a worker from the factory, with cold sarcasm and great complaints. On May 17, the factory finally sent a letter to the Workers' Daily with a public reply. The letter contained many explanations and the self-criticism was extremely superficial. Recently, the Materials Bureau of the Ministry of Railways wrote a letter to the Workers' Daily, also believing that Yang Enqing's reflections were basically correct. After Yang Enqing's article was published, the bureau immediately sent personnel to the fittings factory for on-site investigation. A working group will be established to go to the factory to assist in handling various issues. It is hoped that the person in charge of the factory, with the direct assistance of the leadership organs, will thoroughly examine all the problems existing in the factory and conduct public self-criticism of their own mistakes and shortcomings. Only in this way can they consolidate their connection with the masses, establish leadership prestige, mobilize the enthusiasm of the workers, and improve the various tasks of the factory.

　　铁道部天津钢铁配件厂厂长
    拒绝接受工人批评
    【本报讯】工人日报消息：铁道部材料局天津钢铁配件一厂厂长邢笑先，拒绝接受该厂工人杨恩庆所反映的正确意见（原文刊登于四月廿五日工人日报），不认真检讨自己的缺点，并找工人日报记者王源和该厂工人杨恩庆谈话，对报纸公开批评该厂，表示非常不满。这种直接抗拒党中央“关于在报纸刊物上展开批评和自我批评决定”的态度，是十分错误的。该厂现存问题很多，可以看出行政方面是脱离群众的。党的支部放弃领导；工会工作全部停顿；管委会流于形式；卫生设备极差。工人杨恩庆为改进该厂工作，曾先后向该厂主任、工会主任及管委会委员提出意见。但没有任何结果。四月十七日，杨恩庆把这些情形反映给工人日报，要求上级工会注意，帮助整顿工作。杨恩庆这种爱护工厂，认真负责的态度和做法，是完全正确的。工人日报接到此信后，曾两次派记者深入该厂调查，证明通讯员所反映的情况，基本上是符合事实的。该报遂于四月廿五日，将杨恩庆的文章发表。配件厂领导人不仅不虚心接受意见，积极改进工作；反而迁怒于工人通讯员及记者，于五月二日，找工人日报记者王源和该厂工人杨恩庆谈话，冷讽热嘲，大发牢骚。五月十七日，该厂始致函工人日报公开答复。信内多所解释，检讨极不深刻。最近，铁道部材料局曾给工人日报写信，亦认为杨恩庆的反映，基本上是正确的。该局于杨恩庆的文章发表后，当即派员赴配件厂实地调查。并将成立工作组，前往该厂协助处理各项问题。希望该厂负责人，在领导机关直接帮助下，彻底检查厂内存在的一切问题，对于自己的错误和缺点，进行公开的自我批评。只有这样，才能巩固和群众的联系，树立领导威信，发动工人的积极性，改进该厂的各种工作。
