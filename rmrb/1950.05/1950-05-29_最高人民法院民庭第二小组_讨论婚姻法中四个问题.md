　　Supreme People's Court Civil Division Second Group
    Discusses Four Issues in the Marriage Law
    [This newspaper report] Reporter Bai Sheng reports: The Second Group of the Civil Division of the Supreme People's Court (specializing in handling marriage cases) has accumulated some experience in practically dealing with marriage issues. Therefore, their study and discussion of the Marriage Law is lively; there are debates, questions, and answers.
    In the study and discussion, the questions they raised can be roughly summarized into four points.
    The first is about "freedom of marriage" and the issue of "one party resolutely demanding a divorce." Most people in the past had a relatively clear understanding of freedom of marriage, but their understanding of freedom of divorce was insufficient. Someone asked: Is freedom of marriage conditional and restricted? The result of the discussion was a unanimous agreement that it is not unconditional and unrestricted. The so-called freedom is aimed at the unfreedom of the feudal marriage system, and the new free marriage should be based on the new democratic moral foundation. Article 17 of Chapter 5 of the Marriage Law stipulates: "If one party of a man or woman resolutely demands a divorce, and mediation by the People's Government and judicial organs is ineffective, divorce shall also be granted." How should this be specifically grasped in actual case handling? In the discussion, they believed that this should be viewed from two aspects: First, marriage needs to be maintained by the feelings of both parties. If the feelings are completely broken and cannot be restored, it would be painful for both parties if divorce is not granted. However, on the other hand, if only feelings are considered, some urban women who admire vanity and some men who take a frivolous attitude towards marriage may take advantage of this. Therefore, any party's "resoluteness" must be backed by legitimate reasons. People who attempt to abuse freedom of divorce or misunderstand freedom of divorce should be given education and persuasion, and their erroneous ideas should be corrected. For example, in a divorce case handled by the Supreme Court last year, an urban woman had a good relationship with her husband after marriage, but she was unwilling to engage in labor production. The couple originally lived in the countryside, and she proposed to her husband: If you don't move to the city (Tianjin) to live, I will resolutely divorce. The Tianjin People's Court saw that she was so resolute, so they granted her a divorce. However, the man was not convinced and appealed to the Supreme People's Court. After careful investigation and research by the Supreme People's Court, it was considered that although the woman was resolute, she was unreasonable. If approved easily, it would not only encourage the woman's incorrect ideas, but also be unfavorable to society. Therefore, the Supreme People's Court considered the handling by the Tianjin People's Court to be inappropriate. Generally speaking, in the absence of abusive behavior by both parties, but with genuinely bad feelings, persuasive education should be adopted to make them realize their mistakes and abandon their past incorrect opinions, and divorce should not be approved lightly.
    The second is about marriage registration. Someone asked if this is a "formality"; if all conditions comply with the Marriage Law, but there is no registration, is it considered legal? This issue was discussed for a long time, and the result was that registration is not a formality, but a necessary procedure for government review and approval. The significance of the review is mainly to oppose the continued existence of feudal arranged and forced marriage systems. Unregistered marriages are generally not recognized.
    The third is about the equal right of ownership and disposal of family property by both husband and wife. Someone asked, what should be done if one party squanders the property at will, causing disputes? After discussion, everyone believed that the ownership and disposal rights of property will be equal only when both husband and wife can live together in accordance with the spirit of Articles 7 and 8 of Chapter 3 of the Marriage Law. If one party squanders the property at will, or even causes disputes, then the national law should protect the progressive side, educate the backward side, and carefully handle property issues.
    The fourth is about non-marital children enjoying the same rights as marital children. Someone asked if this would cause deviations and encourage "guerrilla warfare" between unmarried men and women? As a result of the discussion, everyone believed that a new democratic society implements a monogamous marriage system and should resolutely oppose incorrect and irresponsible attitudes towards marriage. Regarding non-marital children, Article 15 of Chapter 4 of the Marriage Law stipulates that their biological father should bear all or part of the necessary living and educational expenses for the children until they reach the age of eighteen. This article, on the one hand, protects the interests of children, and on the other hand, increases the burden on the biological father, which is actually a good warning and restriction on illegal marriages.

### 最高人民法院民庭第二小组  讨论婚姻法中四个问题

　　最高人民法院民庭第二小组
    讨论婚姻法中四个问题
    【本报讯】记者柏生报道：最高人民法院民事庭第二小组（专门办理婚姻案件）在实际处理婚姻问题中已有了一些经验，因此，他们对婚姻法的学习讨论就显得生动；有争辩、有疑问，也有解答。
    在学习讨论中，他们提出的问题，大致可归纳为四个。
    第一是关于“婚姻自由”和“一方坚决离婚”的问题。大部分人过去对结婚自由认识比较明确，而对离婚自由认识却不够。有人提出：婚姻自由，是不是有条件、有限制的？讨论结果，一致认为不是无条件无限制的。所谓自由是针对着封建主义婚姻制度的不自由而言，而新的自由的婚姻是要建立在新民主主义的道德基础上的。婚姻法第五章第十七条规定：“男女一方坚决要求离婚的，经过人民政府和司法机关调解无效时，亦准予离婚。”这条在实际办案中应如何具体掌握？在讨论中，他们认为：这应从两方面来看：首先婚姻是需要双方的感情来维系的，如果感情一旦完全破裂，不能恢复时，若不准离婚，对双方都是一种痛苦。但另一方面，如单从感情着眼，城市一些羡慕虚荣的妇女和一些对婚姻取轻率态度的男人，又可借此钻空子了。所以任何一方的“坚决”是要正当理由做后盾的。对企图滥用离婚自由或误解离婚自由的人，应给以教育和说服，并纠正其错误思想。例如最高法院去年处理的离婚案件中，有一个城市妇女结婚后与丈夫感情原来不坏，但她不愿从事劳动生产。夫妻原住乡下，她对丈夫提出：如果不搬到城市（天津）居住，就坚决要离婚。天津市人民法院看她那么坚决，遂准她离婚。但男方不服上诉到最高人民法院，经最高人民法院仔细调查、研究后，认为女方虽然坚决，但是无理，如果轻易批准，不但助长女方不正确思想，而且对社会也是不利。因此，最高人民法院认为天津市人民法院的处理不妥。一般来说，在双方没有虐待行为，而确有感情不好的情况下，应采取说服教育的办法，使他们认识自己的错误，放弃过去不正确的意见，不应轻率批准离婚。
    第二是关于结婚登记的问题，有人问这是不是一种“形式”；如一切条件皆合乎婚姻法，就是没登记，这算不算合法。这个问题讨论了很久，结果都认为登记不是形式，而是政府审查、认可的必要手续。审查的意义，主要是反对封建包办、强迫婚姻制度的继续存在。不登记的婚姻，原则上是一律不予承认的。
    第三是关于夫妻双方对于家庭财产有平等的所有权与处理权的问题。有人提出如一方任意挥霍，发生纠纷时，该如何处理？讨论后大家认为夫妻双方如能按照婚姻法中第三章第七条、第八条的精神过共同生活时，对财产的所有权与处理权才会是平等的。如一方任意挥霍，甚至发生纠纷时，则国家法律就要保护进步的一方面，对落后的一方面加以教育，并慎重处理财产问题。
    第四是关于非婚生子女享受与婚生子女同等的权利，有人问这样是否会发生偏差，鼓励了“打游击”的非婚男女？讨论结果，大家认为：新民主主义社会，是执行一夫一妻的婚姻制度，应坚决反对对婚姻采取不正确、不负责任的态度。关于非婚生子女，在婚姻法第四章第十五条中规定，其生父应负担子女必需的生活费和教育费全部或一部，直至子女十八岁为止。这一条，一方面保护了儿童的利益，另一方面，加重了生父的负担，实际上是对不合法婚姻的一个很好的警告和限制。
