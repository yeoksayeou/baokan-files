　　Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, 12th. Qingdao's "Sea Market" (from Grain Rain to Start of Summer) has had a bumper harvest of aquatic products this spring. From April 1st to May 10th, in forty days, the total fish production was over 7,428,000 catties, exceeding the total output of the previous three months. At market prices, this is worth over 6,355,464,000 RMB. The fishing fleet included 56 public and private fishing trawlers and over a hundred sailboats. To prevent the fish market from being flooded and fish prices from falling, affecting the interests of fishermen, the Shandong Provincial Aquatic Products Company has organized private merchants to heavily salt fresh fish for transport and sale to various parts of Shandong and Shanghai. The company has already produced 140,000 catties of dried fish and is preparing to transport and sell them to South China and other regions.

　　青岛“大海市”渔产丰收
    【新华社青岛十二日电】青岛今春“大海市”（从谷雨到立夏）渔产丰收，自四月一日至五月十日四十天共产鱼七百四十二万八千余斤，超过前三个月的产量总和。按市价共值人民币六十三亿五千四百六十四万余元。出海渔船包括公私渔轮五十六艘，帆船百余只。山东省水产公司为防止鱼市充斥，鱼价低落，影响渔民利益，已组织私商大量盐制鲜鱼，向山东各地及上海等地运销。该公司现已制成鱼干十四万斤，准备运销华南等地。
