　　Ministry of Agriculture's East China Spring Ploughing Inspection Team Completes Spring Ploughing Inspection Work in Southern Jiangsu
    [Shanghai News] The Spring Ploughing Inspection Team dispatched to East China by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government completed its inspection of spring ploughing production in Southern Jiangsu District on May 14th and is now proceeding to Zhejiang, Northern Jiangsu, Southern Anhui, and Northern Anhui to continue its work. This Spring Ploughing Inspection Team arrived in Southern Jiangsu on April 26th. After more than half a month of in-depth inspections in various counties, districts, townships, and villages in Southern Jiangsu, it was found that the district had initially implemented the Central People's Government's 1950 agricultural production plan, especially in achieving slogans such as timely sowing and ensuring that not a single mu of land is left uncultivated, major achievements have been made. However, the district's 1950 agricultural production plan has not yet been finalized, and the leadership of local governments at all levels over production work is not concentrated and forceful enough. Therefore, there are still some shortcomings in spring ploughing production. Based on the suggestions for improving production made by the Spring Ploughing Inspection Team, the Southern Jiangsu Administrative Office convened a meeting of county heads of the district on May 17th to re-study and deploy production work.

　　农业部华东春耕检查团完成苏南春耕检查工作
    【上海讯】中央人民政府农业部派往华东的春耕检查团，已于五月十四日完成对苏南区春耕生产的检查，现正转赴浙江、苏北、皖南、皖北等地继续工作。该春耕检查团系于四月二十六日到达苏南，经半个多月来深入苏南各县、区、乡、村检查的结果，发现该区已初步贯彻了中央人民政府一九五○年农业生产计划，特别是在实现及时进行播种、保证不荒一亩田等口号上，已获得重大成绩。但该区一九五○年农业生产计划尚未最后确定，当地各级政府对生产工作的领导还不够集中有力，因此在春耕生产上也存在着一些缺点。苏南行署已根据春耕检查团所提的改进生产的意见，在五月十七日召开了该区各县县长会议，重新研究和布置了生产工作。
