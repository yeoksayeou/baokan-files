　　People's Court Actively Clears Backlogged Cases
　　540 Cases Concluded in Five Days
　　[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Since the Beijing People's Court fully launched its work to clear backlogged cases on the 15th of this month, the Civil and Criminal Divisions of the court and the trial groups in various districts have concluded 540 cases within five days. In order to rapidly advance the work of clearing backlogged cases, the court has added a Criminal Field Division and a Civil Affairs Mediation Division to specifically handle newly received criminal cases and civil disputes that have not yet been filed.
　　Since the liberation of Beijing, under the education of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the political consciousness of the people has been universally raised. The broad masses of the people have changed their past mentality of "suffering injustice silently." Now they regard the People's Court as a place for reasoning, and the number of litigation cases has therefore gradually increased. According to the statistics of the Municipal Court, from its establishment on March 18 last year to March 18 this year, it received a total of 22,689 civil and criminal cases, more than twice the 7,379 cases handled by the Kuomintang Beiping District Court in 1947.
　　The Municipal People's Court has always adopted a positive, responsible, and prudent attitude towards filed cases. However, due to the excessive number of cases received and insufficient staffing, and also due to a lack of bold innovation in work methods, as of May 10, the backlog of cases reached 3,537. Among them, 2,654 were civil cases and 883 were criminal cases. The vast majority of these backlogged cases were left over from the old society. For example, 90% of housing disputes and more than 80% of marriage cases were caused by the unreasonable system of the old society. On the other hand, it is also because the broad masses of the people do not regard today's courts as old government offices, so even small disputes are brought to the court, thus increasing the number of cases. In 1949, among 278 debt disputes, debt cases involving less than 1,000 catties of millet accounted for one-half.
　　In order to accelerate the clearing of these backlogged cases and reduce the people's burden of litigation, the Municipal People's Court specially requested and obtained approval from the Municipal People's Government to transfer more than 260 cadres from various organs, organizations, and schools in the urban area, including the Municipal Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Municipal People's Government, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Law Department of Peking University, to participate in this work. On May 10, the Municipal People's Court convened a mobilization meeting for the cadres participating in the work of clearing backlogged cases, and divided all the cadres into twelve trial groups based on districts, and dispatched them to various districts to hear general civil cases and minor criminal cases.
　　With the strong assistance of the district offices and the district committees of the Communist Party of China, trial work groups were quickly established in various districts, and were divided into marriage, debt, and housing groups according to the nature of the cases. The district chief, the heads of the Civil Affairs Section, the Mediation Section, and the Industry and Commerce Section of the Seventh District all participated in the work.
　　The comrades who newly participated in the work of clearing backlogged cases were in high spirits and worked actively. The comrades working in the Municipal Court often read case files and wrote judgments late into the night. The comrades working in the Eleventh District even voluntarily stipulated that 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM be office hours. Other districts also used evenings to hold group meetings to review and study the problems that occurred on the day and plan the work for the next day.
　　In the process of clearing old cases, new civil and criminal cases are still increasing day by day. The field division of the criminal group was established to specifically handle newly received criminal cases. From April 25 to May 20, a total of 110 new cases were received, and 87 cases have been concluded. Because there is a consultation office mediation division, some cases that originally needed to be filed are now reconciled in the mediation division. This on the one hand reduces the increase of new cases, and on the other hand indirectly helps the work of clearing backlogged cases.

### 人民法院积极清理积案  五日内结案五百四十件

　　人民法院积极清理积案
    五日内结案五百四十件
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市人民法院清理积案工作自本月十五日全面展开，五天内在该院民、刑庭及各区审判组结案的已达五百四十件，该院为了迅速推进清理积案工作，已增设刑事外勤庭和民事问事处调解庭，专门处理新收的刑事案件和尚未起诉的民事纠纷。
    北京解放之后，人民在共产党和人民政府的教育之下，政治觉悟普遍提高，广大人民改变了过去“屈死不告状”的心理，现在他们把人民法院看作说理的地方，讼诉案件因此逐渐增加，根据市法院统计，该院从去年三月十八日成立，到今年三月十八日，共收进民刑案件二万二千六百八十九件，比伪北平地方法院三十六年度的七千三百七十九件多出二倍。
    市人民法院对于起诉案件，一贯是采取积极负责慎重处理的态度，但由于收入案件过多，干部力量不足，同时在工作中也没有大胆放手创造新的工作方法，截至五月十日止，积压案件达三千五百三十七件。其中民事二千六百五十四件，刑事八百八十三件。这些积案，绝大多数都是旧社会遗留下来的，如房屋纠纷的百分之九十，婚姻案件的百分之八十以上，都是旧社会不合理的制度所造成的恶果。另方面也由于广大人民不把今天的法院看成旧衙门，纵使是些小的纠纷，也控诉到法院来，案件因此增多，一九四九年二百七十八件债务纠纷中，一千斤小米以下的债务案，即占二分之一。
    市人民法院为了加速清理这些积压案件，减少人民的讼累，特呈准市人民政府，从市区各机关、团体、学校包括中共市委会，市人民政府、市公安局、市总工会和北大法律系调集干部二百六十余人，参加此项工作，五月十日由市人民法院召集参加工作的干部举行清理积案的动员大会，并以区为单位将所有干部组成十二个审判组，分赴各区，审理一般民事案件和情节较轻的刑事案件。
    在各区区公所和中共区委的大力协助下，各区都迅速成立了审判工作组，按照案件的性质分为婚姻、债务、房屋等小组。七区的区长、民政科、调解科和工商科等各科科长，都参加了工作。
    新参加清理积案工作的同志们，情绪高涨，工作积极。在市法院工作的同志们，经常深夜阅卷写判决书，在十一区的工作同志，更自动规定晚上七时至九时为办公时间，其他各区也利用晚上开小组会，检讨与研究当天发生的问题，计划第二天的工作。
    在清理旧案的过程中，新的民事和刑事案件还是日益增加着，刑事组的外勤庭是为了专门处理新收刑事案件而设立的，自四月二十五日起至五月二十日止，共收入新案件一百一十件，已结案八七件。因为有了问事处调解庭，有的原来要起诉的案子，现在在调解庭中就和解了。这样一方面是减少了新案的增加，另一方面即间接帮助了清理积案的工作。
