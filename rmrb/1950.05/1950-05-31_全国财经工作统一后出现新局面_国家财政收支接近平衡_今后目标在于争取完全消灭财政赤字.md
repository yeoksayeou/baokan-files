Xinhua News Agency, 30th. Since the unification of national financial and economic work in March, a new situation of national fiscal revenue and expenditure approaching balance has emerged. According to statistics from the Ministry of Finance of the Central People's Government: the deficit in March decreased by 80.2% compared to January, and by 71.8% compared to February. By April, revenue and expenditure were approaching balance. This is the fundamental reason for the general stability of prices nationwide since March.

The reason why fiscal revenue and expenditure have been trending towards balance over the past two months is primarily due to the rectification of revenue, which has increased the nation's cash income. Taking national tax revenue as an example: March increased by 10.8% compared to January, and April increased by 58.3% compared to January. Regarding the profits of state-owned enterprises, this item had no standing in February's cash expenditures, but by April, it accounted for 16.7% of the month's total cash expenditures.

The second reason is that local expenditures have been greatly reduced. For example, the Northwest Administrative Region, due to streamlining its institutions, verifying personnel, and suspending some projects that could be delayed, reduced the original budgeted expenditure for the year by 40% in March; meanwhile, in terms of revenue, it could also increase by 8% after rectification. Therefore, the deficit decreased from 70% of the original budget to 30%. Other major administrative regions are not as barren as the Northwest, but in the past, most of them also required subsidies from the Central People's Government. Now, due to the consistent and resolute implementation of the Central People's Government's policy of striving to balance revenue and expenditure and stabilize financial prices by local people's governments, and their efforts to save expenditures and rectify revenue, they have all had surpluses to hand over to the Central Government.

Third, due to the unification of revenue and expenditure under the Central People's Government, the Central People's Government can measure the urgency and importance from the overall situation and rationally allocate various expenditures. Therefore, the largest national basic expenditures such as supporting the front lines, disaster relief, and key economic recovery have been guaranteed and can no longer rely on issuing banknotes to maintain.

The unification of national fiscal revenue and expenditure and the situation of revenue and expenditure approaching balance are something that the reactionary rulers of China have exhausted various methods to achieve in recent decades but have consistently failed to do. The issue now is how to continue to work hard in both aspects of saving expenditures and rectifying revenue to eliminate the deficit in the annual budget and achieve complete balance in national fiscal revenue and expenditure.

### 全国财经工作统一后出现新局面  国家财政收支接近平衡  今后目标在于争取完全消灭财政赤字

　　全国财经工作统一后出现新局面
    国家财政收支接近平衡
    今后目标在于争取完全消灭财政赤字
    【新华社三十日讯】自三月份统一全国财经工作以来，国家财政收支接近平衡的新局面已经出现。据中央人民政府财政部统计：三月份赤字比一月份减少百分之八十点二，比二月份减少百分之七十一点八，至四月份收支已接近平衡。这便是三月以来全国物价普遍稳定的基本原因。
    两月来财政收支之所以能日趋平衡，第一个原因是整顿了收入，国家的现金收入增加了。以全国税收为例：三月份比一月份增加百分之十点八，四月份比一月份增加百分之五十八点三。再如公营企业利润一项，在二月份现金支出中还没有地位，至四月份已占该月现金支出总数的百分之十六点七。
    第二个原因是地方开支大大紧缩了。如西北行政区由于整编机构，核实人马，停办了一些可以缓办的事业，三月份内已把原来的本年度概算支出减少了百分之四十；同时收入方面，在整顿之后还可以增加百分之八。因此赤字就由原概算的百分之七十减到百分之三十。其他各大行政区不像西北那样贫瘠，但过去大部分都同样需要中央人民政府补贴。现在由于各地人民政府一致坚决地执行了中央人民政府力求平衡收支、稳定金融物价的方针，努力节约支出，整顿收入，已都有盈余上解中央。
    第三，由于收支统一于中央人民政府，中央人民政府便能从全局来衡量缓急轻重，合理分配各种支出。因此支援前线、救灾、重点恢复经济等最大的国家基本支出已有了保证，可以不再靠发行钞票来维持了。
    国家财政收支的统一和收支接近平衡的局面，这是近数十年来中国反动统治者用尽了各种办法而始终未能达到的。今后的问题是如何继续在节约支出、整顿收入两方面努力，以消灭全年概算中的赤字，作到国家财政收支的全部平衡。
