　　Value People's Opinions, Value Newspapers
　　Chen Buxiang, Employee of Beijing Postal Remittance Bureau

　　On April 5th, the Beijing Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau received a letter from citizen Zheng Xinjun, forwarded by the People's Garden section of the People's Daily, raising opinions about our bureau's collection procedures and questioning a telegraphic money order. When Zhang, from the receiving and dispatching desk, saw the letter, he thought Zheng was being idle and nosy, and that it was not necessary to treat the letter seriously as an official document for registration. I said to him: Now people can openly raise their opinions, and since the newspaper has forwarded the letter, we should carefully study and respond to it. Later, with the request of Gao Qingyuan, the head of the document section, he registered the letter and forwarded it to the relevant departments. Upon seeing the letter, the business and accounting departments immediately studied it carefully. Wu Zhiguang, the head of the business department, went to the telegraph office to find out the time the telegraphic money order was sent, and on April 8th, he sent a detailed explanation of the two issues raised by Zheng to the People's Daily for transmission, and it has already been published in the newspaper in summary (see the "People's Garden" on April 13th). I think we should value the opinions of the masses and value newspapers. We should study and accept good opinions from the people; if there are misunderstandings, we should also explain them carefully. Only in this way can we better improve our work based on everyone's opinions. We must never dismiss them as "idle" or "nosy" and ignore them.

　　Editor's Note: This letter was received last month, and we apologize for the technical oversight that has delayed its publication until now.

　　重视人民意见  重视报纸
    北京市邮汇局职员　陈步湘
    四月五日，北京邮政储金汇业局收到人民日报人民园地组转来市民郑信君一封信，对于我局收款手续提出意见和对一笔电报汇款提出疑问。当时收发台的张君看到这信，认为郑君无聊，多管闲事，他认为不必把这信郑重其事当正式公文登记。我对他说：现在人民有意见，都可公开提，报馆既然把信转来，我们应该好好研讨答复。后经文书股长高庆元请他把这信登记，他就登记了转送有关部门。营业、出纳课看到这封信，马上慎重研讨，营业课长吴志光就到译电台查明发送电汇电报的时间，于四月八日将郑君所问的两件事，详细解释，函送人民日报转达，并已经报社摘要刊登（见四月十三日《人民园地》）。我认为我们应当重视群众意见，应当重视报纸。人民有好的意见，应该研讨接受；有误会，也该仔细解释。这样才可以根据大家的意见，更好地改进工作。绝不能认为这是“无聊”、“多管闲事”而置之不理。
    编者按：这封信是上月收到的，因技术上的疏忽，现在才能发表，特此致歉。
