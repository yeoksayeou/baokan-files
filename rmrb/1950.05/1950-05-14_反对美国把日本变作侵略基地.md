　　Oppose the United States Turning Japan into a Base of Aggression
　　Wang Zongyi

　　In order to occupy Japan for a long time and turn it into a U.S. colony and a military base for aggression against the Far East, U.S. imperialism is now stepping up its conspiracy to separately conclude a peace treaty with Japan, while actively restoring and expanding Japan's former naval and air bases. The activities of the U.S. occupation authorities in Japan, headed by MacArthur, and their running dog Yoshida government in this regard have recently become even more unscrupulous. Disregarding the verdict of the Tokyo International Tribunal, MacArthur ordered the complete release of Japanese war criminals such as Shigemitsu Mamoru, who had not yet completed their sentences, on March 7 of this year because these war criminals had "behaved well." On the other hand, in order to suppress the Japanese people's resistance to the U.S. reactionary policy, MacArthur, in a statement issued on April 29 to commemorate the first anniversary of the so-called new Japanese constitution, openly violated the Potsdam Declaration's provisions on encouraging Japanese democratic forces, claiming that he would consider declaring the Japanese Communist Party illegal. On May 4, MacArthur, in his reply to Soviet representative Derevyanko of the Allied Council for Japan, undisguisedly admitted the fact that the United States was building large-scale naval and air bases in Japan and flatly rejected Derevyanko's questioning of the matter. On the day before this, May 3, Yoshida clamored for a separate peace treaty with Britain and the United States at a meeting of Liberal Party Diet members, and arrogantly believed that "insisting on concluding a treaty including Communist China and the Soviet Union is unreasonable." On May 8, Yoshida repeated this clamor at the National Governors' Conference in Japan. These facts show that U.S. imperialism is unscrupulously tearing up the Potsdam Declaration and turning Japan into a tool for the United States to re-launch aggression in the Far East.

　　MacArthur's reply to Derevyanko on May 4 is particularly worthy of vigilance from the Chinese people and all peace-loving people. In this reply, MacArthur made a ridiculous sophistry about the U.S. military base construction on the Ryukyu Islands. He said: "The Ryukyu Islands are currently within the scope of international jurisdiction, and during the post-surrender period, these islands are completely under the control of the U.S. government. The Far Eastern Commission and the Allied Council for Japan are not involved in the administration of the islands. The U.S. government has complete freedom to take any military measures there as it deems appropriate." Who gave MacArthur the right to make such an announcement? MacArthur has no basis in any international agreement here; what he "relies on" is only his own illegal order. According to the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration: "Japanese sovereignty must be limited to Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku, and such other minor islands as we determine." The "we" here refers to China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States. However, without the consent of the other three countries, MacArthur issued an order on January 29, 1946, arbitrarily dividing the islands originally belonging to Japan and assigning them to Japan and the United States respectively. In this illegal order, the Ryukyu Islands were also demarcated with 30 degrees north latitude as the boundary. The small islands north of this latitude were assigned to Japan, while the islands to the south were all under the jurisdiction of the U.S. military, becoming U.S. naval and air bases in the Pacific. Such illegal measures cannot be recognized by the Chinese people. The Chinese people have a long history of relations with the Ryukyu Islands and cannot but express the greatest concern for Ryukyu and its people. Japanese imperialism invaded and occupied Ryukyu from China in 1879 as its colony, and later used it as a springboard for further aggression against China and the South Pacific. We must not allow the Ryukyu people, who have suffered more than 70 years of enslavement by Japanese imperialism, to become slaves of U.S. imperialism after Japan's surrender, and we especially cannot allow the land of Ryukyu to become a military base for U.S. imperialism to re-launch aggression.

　　In his reply to Derevyanko, MacArthur defended the U.S. actions to restore Japan's former naval and air bases in a provocative tone, saying: "The British and American bases and facilities in Japan are maintained in a state of constant readiness to cope with any accident." MacArthur's sophistry is actually unfounded. The whole world knows that the only ominous "accident" happening in the Far East now is the U.S. imperialism's actions to provoke war. For this purpose, the U.S. government has built a huge base network in the Pacific, which starts from the U.S. military base in Alaska, through the Aleutian Islands, Japan, Ryukyu, the Philippines, Borneo, Sumatra, Vietnam, and extends to Thailand, Burma, and even India. MacArthur boasted of the effectiveness of this base network to a group of Australian reporters on April 29, saying: "The area from Siberia to southern China is within the range of aircraft taking off from Allied bases – mainly U.S. bases." (Associated Press, Tokyo, 7th) This has made the sinister intentions of U.S. imperialism clear. Since MacArthur has openly declared that the U.S. base network in the Pacific is aimed at China and the Soviet Union, this should arouse the full vigilance of the Chinese people and resolutely oppose the U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to use Japan to aggress against the Far East.

　　In order to completely shatter the U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to use Japan to undermine peace in the Far East, the only effective way is to quickly sign a peace treaty with Japan with the participation of the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union, end the U.S. occupation of Japan, and put Japan on the road to democratization. However, U.S. imperialism is doing its best to obstruct and sabotage the signing of this treaty. They are attempting to replace this genuine peace treaty with Japan with a so-called "separate treaty." The content of the so-called "separate treaty" is that the United States, Britain, and Japan nominally conclude a treaty, but in reality, the U.S. occupation of Japan remains the same, and furthermore, in the form of "concluding a U.S.-Japan military alliance," the United States will occupy Japanese land, sea, and air bases for a long time. Simultaneously with the conspiracy to prepare for a separate peace, U.S. imperialism is also actually implementing a plan of "undeclared peace" with Japan. According to this plan, MacArthur announced on February 9 and 25 of this year that the U.S. government had invited the Japanese government to "establish offices similar to consulates" in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Honolulu, and allowed Japan to participate in technical international conferences and agreements in the future. Yoshida admitted at the National Governors' Conference in Japan on May 8 that Japan had concluded many "actual treaties" with the United States and other countries in the U.S.-British group. Yoshida also unreservedly said that the so-called "actual treaties" and "separate treaties" are only different in form, and the only remaining task is to expand the "actual treaties" into legal treaties. Here, the "actual treaties" mentioned by Yoshida refer to the many measures taken by the U.S. government under the plan of "undeclared peace" to restore Japan's international activities. It should be pointed out that whether it is a "separate treaty" or an "actual treaty," it is contrary to the principles stipulated by the Potsdam Conference, the Moscow Conference, and the 1942 "United Nations Declaration Against Fascism," and is illegal. The Potsdam Conference and the Moscow Conference stipulated that the preparation for a peace treaty with an enemy country must be prepared by a meeting of foreign ministers of major powers. The "United Nations Declaration Against Fascism" stipulated: "Each government undertakes to cooperate with the governments that signed this declaration and not to conclude a separate armistice agreement or peace treaty with the enemy country." China has the closest relationship with Japan and is the country that resisted Japan earliest, longest, and with the greatest sacrifices. The Soviet Union is the decisive force that forced Japan to surrender. Now, U.S. imperialism wants to disregard international principles and separately conclude a peace treaty with Japan, bypassing China and the Soviet Union, so as to turn Japan into a U.S. war base in the Far East against China and the Soviet Union. This is of course absolutely not allowed by the Chinese and Soviet people, and it is also not allowed by the Japanese people.

　　In order to oppose the U.S. imperialism's "separate treaty” and the plan to turn Japan into a military base, the Japanese people, under the leadership of the Japanese Communist Party have launched movement calling for "a comprehensive peace treaty based on the Potsdam Declaration." The Japanese people now realize that the so-called "separate treaty" actually means placing the Japanese people in the position of colonial slaves and tools of new war; while the "comprehensive peace" based on the Potsdam Declaration can enable their country to gain independence, democracy, and freedom. Therefore, not only the broad masses of working people in Japan, but even some national bourgeoisie, are actively participating in this "comprehensive peace" movement, thereby making this movement a broad mass movement. MacArthur also had to admit: "The movement among the Japanese to insist on the withdrawal of foreign bases after the signing of the treaty has now gained momentum." (MacArthur's remarks to Australian reporters on April 29) The reason why MacArthur wants to instigate the Japanese reactionary government to find ways to declare the Japanese Communist Party illegal is precisely to suppress the Japanese people's "comprehensive peace" movement. However, no matter what despicable means MacArthur takes, the just struggle of the Japanese people for the independence and freedom of their country cannot be suppressed. The efforts of the Chinese and Soviet people, who have formed a solid alliance, coupled with the efforts of the Japanese people, will surely smash the U.S. imperialism's sinister plan to use Japan to launch a war of aggression in the Far East.

　　反对美国把日本变作侵略基地
　　王宗一
    美国帝国主义为了长期占领日本，把日本变作美国的殖民地和侵略远东的军事基地，现在正一方面加紧进行单独与日本媾和的阴谋，一方面在积极恢复和扩大日本的前海空军基地。以麦克阿瑟为首的驻日美国占领军当局及其走狗吉田政府在这方面的活动，最近更加肆无忌惮起来了。麦克阿瑟不顾东京国际法庭的判决，在今年三月七日下令全部释放重光葵等刑期未满的日本战犯，因为这些战犯“行为良好”。而另一方面，为了镇压日本人民对于美国反动政策的反抗，麦克阿瑟在四月二十九日为纪念所谓日本新宪法一周年所发表的文告中，却公然违背波茨坦宣言关于鼓励日本民主势力的规定，声称要考虑宣布日本共产党为非法。五月四日，麦克阿瑟又在其致盟国对日管制委员会苏联代表德勒维扬哥的复函中，毫不掩饰地承认了美国在日本大规模建筑海空军基地的事实，并焊然拒绝了德勒维扬哥对此事的责问。而在此前一天，即五月三日，吉田则在自由党的国会议员大会上发出了与英、美单独媾和的叫嚣，并狂妄地认为“坚持缔结包括共产党中国及苏联在内的和约是不合理的”。五月八日，吉田又在日本全国县知事会上重复了这一叫嚣。这些事实说明：美国帝国主义正在肆无忌惮地撕毁波茨坦宣言，把日本变作美国在远东从新发动侵略的工具。
    麦克阿瑟五月四日致德勒维扬哥的复函，特别值得中国人民和一切爱好和平的人类的警觉。麦克阿瑟在这个复函中对美国在琉球群岛建筑军事基地的行动作了荒谬的狡辩。他说：“琉球群岛目前并在国际管辖的范围以内，在投降后的时期内，这些岛屿完全受美国政府的管制。远东委员会及盟国对日委员会均与该岛之行政无涉。美国政府有完全的自由在认为适当的场合下在那里采取那种军事措施。”是谁给了麦克阿瑟以如此宣布的权利呢？麦克阿瑟在这里并没有任何国际协议的根据，他所“根据”的只是他自己的非法的命令。按照波茨坦宣言的规定：“日本主权必须限于本州、北海道、九洲、四国及吾人所决定其他小岛之内。”这里的“吾人”是指中苏英美四国。但是，麦克阿瑟未经其他三国的同意，就在一九四六年一月二十九日擅自发出指令，将原属日本的岛屿分别划归日本和美国。在这个非法的指令中，琉球群岛也被划定以北纬三十度为界限，在此以北的几个小岛划给日本，以南的岛屿则统由美军管辖，成为美国在太平洋的海空军基地。这种非法的措置，是中国人民所决不能承认的。中国人民与琉球群岛具有悠久的历史关系，对于琉球和琉球人民不能不表示最大的关切。日本帝国主义在一八七九年从中国手中侵占了琉球作为它的殖民地，以后又被它用作进一步侵略中国和南太平洋的跳板。我们决不能允许已经遭受了日本帝国主义七十多年奴役的琉球人民，在日本投降后，再成为美国帝国主义的奴隶，我们尤其决不能允许琉球的土地成为美国帝国主义从新发动侵略的军事基地。
    麦克阿瑟在他对德勒维扬哥的复函中，以挑衅式的口吻为美国恢复日本的前海空军基地的行动辩护说：“英国与美国在日本的基地与设备，是维持在经常准备应付任何事故的状态下。”麦克阿瑟的这种诡辩实际上是毫无根据的。全世界都知道，远东现在所发生的唯一不祥的“事故”，就是美国帝国主义的挑拨战争的行动。为了这一目的，美国政府已在太平洋建筑起一个庞大的基地网，这一基地网，自阿拉斯加的美军基地开始，经阿留申群岛、日本、琉球、菲律宾、婆罗洲、苏门答腊、越南，一直伸展到泰国、缅甸以至印度。麦克阿瑟在四月二十九日对一群澳大利亚记者宣扬这一基地网的效用说：“从西伯利亚到中国南部的地区均在自盟国基地——主要是美国的基地——起飞的飞机航程之内。”（美联社东京七日电）这已把美国帝国主义的罪恶用心说得清清楚楚。麦克阿瑟既然公开声明美国在太平洋的基地网是以中国和苏联为目标，这就应当引起中国人民的充分警惕，对美国帝国主义利用日本侵略远东的阴谋加以坚决的反对。
    为了彻底打破美国帝国主义利用日本破坏远东和平的阴谋，唯一有效的办法就是迅速签订有中华人民共和国和苏联参加的对日和约，结束美国对日本的占领，使日本走上民主化的道路。但美国帝国主义却在极力阻挠破坏这一和约的签订，他们企图以所谓《单独和约》来代替这一真正的对日和约。所谓《单独和约》的内容，就是名义上由英美和日本订立和约，实际上却使美国占领日本的状况照旧不变，并且更进一步以“缔结美日军事同盟”的形式，由美国长期占用日本的陆海空军基地。与准备单独媾和的阴谋同时，美帝国主义还在实际上执行着一个与日本“不宣而和”的计划。根据这一计划，麦克阿瑟已于今年二月九日和二十五日相继宣布：美国政府已邀请日本政府在纽约、旧金山、洛杉矶和檀香山四地“设立类似领事馆的办事处”，并准许日本今后可以参加技术性的国际会议及协定。吉田于五月八日在日本全国县知事会议中承认：日本已与美国和美英集团其他国家缔结了许多“实际的和约”。吉田并毫不隐讳地说：所谓“实际的和约”与“单独的和约”仅只是形式的不同，唯一剩下未做的任务就是把“实际的和约”扩充为法律的和约。这里吉田所说的“实际的和约”，就是指美国政府在“不宣而和”的计划下所采取的恢复日本国际活动的许多措施而言。应该指出，不管是“单独的和约”，或是“实际的和约”，都是与波茨坦会议、莫斯科会议及一九四二年《联合国反法西斯联合宣言》所规定的原则相违背的，都是非法的。波茨坦会议及莫斯科会议规定了对敌国媾和必须由大国外长会议准备，《联合国反法西斯联合宣言》规定了：“每一政府，承允与本宣言签字国政府合作，并不与敌国缔结单独停战协定或和约。”中国是与日本关系最密切并且是抵抗日本最早最久和牺牲最大的国家，苏联是迫使日本投降的决定力量，现在美国帝国主义竟想不顾国际原则，撇开中苏两国单独与日本媾和，以便把日本变成美国在远东的反中国、反苏联的战争基地，这当然是中国人民和苏联人民绝对不能允许的，也是日本人民所不能允许的。
    日本人民为了反对美国帝国主义的《单独和约》和变日本为军事基地的计划，已在日本共产党的领导下掀起一个要求“根据波茨坦宣言全面讲和”的运动。日本人民现已认识：所谓《单独和约》，实际上即意味着使日本人民陷于殖民地奴隶和新战争工具的地位；而根据波茨坦宣言的“全面讲和”，却能使他们的国家获得独立、民主和自由。因此，不但日本的广大劳苦群众，而且甚至一部民族资产阶级也积极参加了这一“全面讲和”运动，从而使这个运动成为广泛的群众性的运动。麦克阿瑟亦不能不承认：“日本人中间坚持在和约签订后撤消外国基地的运动现在已具声势。”（麦克阿瑟四月二十九日对澳记者谈话）麦克阿瑟之所以要唆使日本反动政府设法宣布日共为非法，其目的正是欲借此镇压日本人民的“全面讲和”运动。但是，不论麦克阿瑟采取什么卑劣手段，日本人民为争取自己国家的独立、自由所进行的正义斗争，都是压服不了的。已为结为巩固同盟的中苏两国人民的努力，加上日本人民的努力，一定要把美国帝国主义利用日本发动远东侵略战争的罪恶计划，打得粉碎。
