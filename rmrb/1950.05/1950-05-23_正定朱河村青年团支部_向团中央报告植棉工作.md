　　Zhengding Zhuhe Village Communist Youth League Branch
    Reports Cotton Planting Work to the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League
    [This newspaper, Zhengding] The entire membership of the Communist Youth League branch in Zhuhe Village, Fifth District, Zhengding, Hebei Province, wrote a letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, reporting on their cotton planting work. The full text is as follows:
    Comrades in charge of the Central Committee of the New Democratic Youth League:
    Our village is the largest village in Zhengding County, with 1,013 households and 4,465 people, including 790 young men and women. The League branch was established last spring, with a total of 41 members. The village has 10,042 mu of irrigated and dry land. It is located south of the Hutuo River and north of the Zhouhan River, and all of the land is alkaline, making it difficult to cultivate seedlings. In the past two years, we have suffered from frequent floods, and the lives of the masses have been somewhat difficult. This year, the government called for a large-scale planting of cotton.
    All of our League members realize that planting cotton is not only beneficial to the country, but also greatly benefits the masses. Therefore, we happily accepted the task given to us by the superior League organization. However, the village is large, the League members are few, and our strength is weak. In addition, we do not study regularly, so we do not have many methods in our work. We are now reporting to you on our work in the cotton planting campaign.
    After receiving the call from the higher authorities, the League branch took the initiative to convene a meeting of all League members to study and plan the cotton planting task. Through democratic discussion among all League members, it was decided that League members should first respond to the call, mobilize their families to plant more cotton, take the lead in influencing the masses, and decide to carry out evaluation of merits and demerits in the cotton planting campaign. League member Wang Junhai's family had sixteen mu of land and originally planned to plant four mu of cotton. He mobilized his father to plant more; his father scolded him, "What the hell do you know? What will we eat if we only plant cotton?" After his repeated mobilization, he explained: We plant cotton here, and there will be less grain, but there are many places in the country that do not grow cotton. Now that the trains are running, are we still afraid of not having grain? After his mobilization, his father's mind was also opened, and he increased the planting by six mu, for a total of ten mu. At the League members' meeting, the branch commended Comrade Wang Junhai. In this way, the enthusiasm of all League members to mobilize their families to plant more cotton was boosted. The 41 League members' families (31 households) have a total of 480.2 mu of land. They originally planned to plant 151.7 mu of cotton, but later increased it by 97.5 mu, for a total of 249.2 mu of cotton, accounting for more than 50 percent of the total land of the League members' families.
    After completing our own cotton planting task, all League members held another meeting to discuss a plan to ensure that each person would mobilize three households of the masses to plant more cotton. In the mobilization, we adhered to the reporting system and brainstorming sessions, exchanged experiences to find solutions, and dispelled the masses' concerns about flooding and the fear that the government would set official prices for purchases in the autumn, thus enhancing the masses' confidence in planting cotton. League member Wang Xiaochang alone mobilized nine households to plant 31 mu of cotton. Fu Jilan (female) is very young, but she also mobilized her aunt to plant more cotton. All League members mobilized a total of 123 households of the masses to plant 738.3 mu of cotton, an increase of 328.3 mu over the original plan of 410 mu, completing the task of each League member ensuring the mobilization of three households of the masses.
    In this cotton planting campaign, our shortcomings were that we carried out mobilization work in isolation, did not bring all the young people in the village along, and neglected to recruit outstanding young people into the League. In the future, we will pay attention to uniting the young masses, actively engage in production, study hard, obey the leadership, become a strong assistant to the government and the Party, and give fuller play to the strength of our young people to serve the construction of the new China.

               With best regards,
            All members of the New Democratic Youth League, Zhuhe Village, Fifth District, Zhengding County, Hebei Province

### 正定朱河村青年团支部  向团中央报告植棉工作

　　正定朱河村青年团支部
    向团中央报告植棉工作
    【本报正定讯】新民主主义青年团河北省正定五区朱河村支部全体团员写信给青年团中央委员会，报告植棉工作。全文如下：
    新民主主义青年团中央委员会负责同志：
    我村是正定县最大的村庄。全村一○一三户、四千四百六十五口人，其中男女青年共七百九十人。去年春天建立了团支部，共有团员四十一名。全村水旱地一万零四十二亩。南临滹沱河、北靠周汗河，全部是碱地阴地，生产中培植幼苗较难。近二年屡遭水灾，群众生活上有些困难。今年政府号召大量种棉花。
    我们全体团员都认识到种棉花不仅对国家有利，群众受益也大。因此，我们愉快的接受了上级团给我们的任务。但村子大，团员少，力量弱，再加上我们学习不经常，所以在工作中办法不多。关于在植棉运动中我们工作的情形，现在报告给您。
    接到上级号召后，团支部主动地召开了团员大会，对植棉任务进行了研究计划。通过全体团员民主讨论，决定团员首先响应号召，动员自己家里多种棉，带头影响群众，并决定在植棉运动中开展评功论过。团员王俊海家里十六亩地，原计划种棉四亩。他动员他爹多种；他爹骂他“你他妈的知道什么？尽种棉花吃什么？”经他再三动员，说明：咱这儿种棉花，粮食少了，可是全国不种棉的地方可多哩。火车通了，还怕没粮食吗？经他动员后，他爹脑筋也打开了，增加六亩，共种了十亩。团员大会上，支部表扬了王俊海同志。这样，把全体团员动员家里多种棉的劲头鼓起来了。四十一个团员家里（三十一户），共有土地四百八十亩二分，原计划植棉一百五十一亩七分，后来增加了九十七亩半，共植棉二百四十九亩二分，占团员家庭总土地的百分之五十以上。
    完成了我们自己种棉任务以后，全体团员又开会讨论计划每人保证动员三户群众多种棉。在动员中，我们坚持了汇报制度和碰头会，大家想办法交换经验，打破群众怕水淹、秋后怕公家订官价来收买等顾虑，提高了群众种棉的信心。只团员王小常一人，就动员了九户，种棉三十一亩。傅记兰（女）年纪很小，也动员她姨母多种棉。全体团员共动员群众一百二十三户，植棉七百三十八亩三分，比原来计划种棉四百一十亩增加了三百二十八亩三分，完成了每个团员保证动员三户群众的任务。
    这次植棉运动中，我们的缺点是孤立的进行动员工作，没把全村青年带动起来，也忽视了吸收优秀青年入团。今后我们要注意团结青年群众，积极生产，努力学习，服从领导，成为政府和党的有力助手，更多的发挥我们青年的力量，为新中国建设而服务。                   
               此致敬礼
            河北省正定五区朱河村新民主主义青年团全体团员
                              五月三日
