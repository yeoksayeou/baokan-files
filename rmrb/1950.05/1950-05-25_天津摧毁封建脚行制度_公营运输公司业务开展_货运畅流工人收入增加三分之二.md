Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 23rd: The Tianjin Publicly Operated Transportation Company, with the support of the搬运工会(Bānyùn gōnghuì, Dockworkers' Union) and the Municipal Public Security Bureau, has destroyed the feudal foot carrier system that oppressed and exploited workers for over two hundred years in the ten months since its establishment. Furthermore, by implementing policies of reasonable freight rates, unified contracting and consignment of business, and allocation of搬运(bānyùn, portage/transportation) forces, freight flows smoothly, and workers' income has also been adjusted and increased.

Before liberation, there were 227 feudal foot carrier businesses in Tianjin, with 3,032 feudal foot carrier bosses who did not work but reaped the benefits among the city's 16,000+ stevedores and transport workers. They colluded with officials and bandits, monopolized搬运(bānyùn, portage/transportation), extorted shippers, and exploited workers. The earnings of workers who labored all day were usually seized by the feudal bosses by 70-80%, and sometimes even 90%. After liberation, workers urgently demanded to be freed from feudal exploitation. Under the leadership of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, 18 transportation service stations were established successively. With the establishment of the Tianjin Publicly Operated Transportation Company in July of last year, the organization of feudal foot carriers was completely destroyed.

At that time, the trade union organization and the People's Government took cautious steps to carry out reforms. The Dockworkers' Union developed and reviewed its membership, and educated workers to overcome guild-style thinking. The Public Security Bureau held training sessions and placed foot carrier bosses under supervision. The transportation company first took a series of reform measures for the搬运(bānyùn, portage/transportation) business, such as democratic appraisal and team formation, implementation of reasonable freight rates, unified allocation of transportation capacity, and contracting and consignment of business.

After democratic appraisal and team formation, the big foot carrier bosses who were lurking among the workers were completely purged. In the city, apart from a small number of scattered vehicles and odd-job workers, over 13,000 stevedores and transport workers, along with 3,540 local license carts and horse-drawn carts, have been completely organized and are under the unified allocation and leadership of the transportation company. After this step, the workers' enthusiasm for labor increased. For example, before team formation, twelve vehicles transporting coal to the French-owned electricity factory only transported 30 tons per day. After team formation, they transported about 100 tons per day, an increase in efficiency of more than three times.

After appropriate adjustments to freight rates, excessively high freight rates before liberation have been reduced by more than 72%, making freight rates more reasonable and greatly reducing cargo costs. Public and private enterprises have signed consignment contracts with the company one after another. Because the heavy exploitation by the foot carrier bosses has been abolished and transportation business has developed, workers' income has also increased by two-thirds compared to the previous average daily income per person. After unified contracting and consignment of business and allocation of transportation capacity, not only has the malpractice of high-price extortion been restricted, but the workers' income has gradually become fairer and more reasonable, moving away from the wide disparity of the past.

### 天津摧毁封建脚行制度  公营运输公司业务开展  货运畅流工人收入增加三分之二

　　天津摧毁封建脚行制度  公营运输公司业务开展
    货运畅流工人收入增加三分之二
    【新华社天津二十三日电】天津市公营运输公司建立十个月来，在搬运工会和市公安局的支持下，已将二百多年来压迫剥削工人的封建脚行摧毁；并由于贯彻了合理运价、统一承揽托运业务、调配搬运力的方针，使货运畅流，工人收入亦得到调整和提高。
    解放前津市原有封建脚行二百二十七家，在全市一万六千多装卸运输工人中，即有三千零三十二个不劳而获的封建脚行头子。他们勾结官匪，垄断搬运，勒索货主，剥削工人。工人终日劳动所得，通常被封建头子攫走百分之七、八十，甚至九十。解放后，工人迫切要求摆脱封建剥削，曾在市公用局领导下，先后建立过十八个运输服务站；到去年七月津市公营运输公司建立，封建脚行的组织才被完全摧毁。
    当时工会组织和人民政府采取了慎重的步骤进行改革。搬运工会发展和审查会员，并教育工人克服行会主义思想，公安局则集训和管制脚行头子，运输公司曾先采取民主评议编队、实行合理运价、统一调配运输力、承揽托运业务等工作步骤，进行了一系列的搬运业务的改革工作。
    经过民主评议编队后，潜伏在工人中的大脚行头子已全被清洗出去，全市除少数散车、散工外，一万三千余个装卸、运输工人与三千五百四十辆地牌车、马车已完全组织起来，受运输搬运公司的统一调配与领导。经过这一步骤，工人的劳动积极性提高了。如编队前十二辆车往法商电灯厂运煤，每天只运三十吨，编队后一天即运百吨左右，效率提高三倍以上。
    运价适当调整后，已将解放前过高的运价减低了百分之七十二强，使运价趋于合理，货物成本大大减低，公私营企业纷纷与公司订立托运合同。由于脚行头子的苛重剥削已被取缔，运输业务开展，工人收入亦由过去平均每人每日收入增加三分之二。统一承揽托运业务和运输力调配后，不但限制了高价勒索的弊端发生，且使工人收入由高低悬殊而逐渐达到公平合理。
