Xinhua News Agency, 14th - A comprehensive TASS dispatch: A ship fully loaded with American arms arrived in Rotterdam, Netherlands, on the 11th. Despite a strong police force being dispatched to the unloading site, and despite the ship's arrival being kept completely secret, as soon as the ship arrived in the port, the workers immediately announced a strike. Women from Rotterdam came to the port and demanded that the dockworkers not participate in the unloading work. The women shouted slogans: "We need peace and bread! No war! Let us secure our children's future!"

On the 12th, peace fighters and police clashed throughout the day in the port area and urban area of Rotterdam. Thousands of Rotterdam residents took to the streets to demonstrate. They held signs saying: "We want peace! No American arms!" On the same day, dockworkers in Amsterdam held a rally to support the struggle of the Rotterdam workers.

The peace committees of Rotterdam, Amsterdam, and other ports, upon learning that another six transport ships fully loaded with American arms would be sailing from the United States to the Netherlands, issued an appeal to port workers nationwide on the 11th, urging them to strongly refuse to unload war materials.

　　美军火船秘密抵鹿特丹
　　工人立即宣布罢工         
  　妇女示威高呼：要和平，不要战争！
    【新华社十四日讯】综合塔斯社消息：满载美国军火的船只一艘，十一日抵达荷兰的鹿特丹港。尽管有强大的警察部队派往起卸地点，尽管该船的到达是完全保守秘密的，然而，当该船一抵该港，工人们立刻就宣布了罢工。鹿特丹的妇女们来到港口，要求海港工人不参加起卸工作。妇女们高呼口号：“我们需要和平与面包！不要战争！让我们保障我们孩子的将来！”。
    十二日，和平斗士与警察在鹿特丹港口地区与城区全日发生冲突。数千鹿特丹的居民到街上示威。他们拿着标语：“我们要和平！不要任何美国军火！”同日，阿姆斯特丹的码头工人举行集会，以声援鹿特丹工人进行的斗争。
    鹿特丹、阿姆斯特丹及其他港口的拥护和平委员会，在获悉将另有六只满载美国军火的运输船自美国开往荷兰的消息后，已于十一日向全国港口工人发出呼吁，吁请他们强硬地拒绝起卸战争物资。
