Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd: A compilation of TASS reports: On May 20th, German newspapers published a communique from the Information Bureau of the German Democratic Republic, announcing that the Soviet and German governments had signed an agreement on the issue of Soviet joint-stock companies in Germany, and the Soviet government had transferred the ownership of twenty-three enterprises to the German people. The communique pointed out that the Soviet Union's transfer of these enterprises, originally belonging to the Soviet Union based on the Potsdam Agreement, is based on the principle of enhancing the friendly relations between the Soviet and German peoples, and to facilitate the development of the peaceful economy of democratic Germany.

　　"Neues Deutschland" published a commentary on the Soviet Union's transfer of enterprises, warmly praising the Soviet government's new generous action. The newspaper pointed out that the twenty-three enterprises transferred include the most important enterprises; the production of these enterprises is of great significance not only for supplying the domestic market but also mainly for export. This move by the Soviet Union is closely linked to the reduction of Germany's remaining reparations and is a clear demonstration of the friendly relations between the great Soviet people and the German people.
