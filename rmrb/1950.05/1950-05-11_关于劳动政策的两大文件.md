　　The Draft Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China is one of the greatest revolutionary achievements obtained by the Chinese working class under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao in the past thirty years. The Draft Trade Union Law clearly stipulates the legal status and responsibilities of trade union organizations under the New Democratic regime, fully guaranteeing the freedom of the Chinese working class in organizing trade unions and other political activities. This is an unprecedented major event in the history of the Chinese labor movement. In order to further improve the Trade Union Law, the State Council of the Central People's Government has published the Draft Trade Union Law before the Central People's Government Committee makes its final revisions and adoption, so as to absorb opinions from all aspects and make final revisions. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has notified the leading organs and responsible comrades of trade union organizations in various regions and industries to conduct extensive and in-depth publicity and hold enthusiastic discussions within trade union organizations in factories, mines, shops, government agencies, farms, schools, etc., and among the broad masses of workers, based on the Draft Trade Union Law and the Worker's Daily editorial "Two Major Documents on Labor Policy." This publishing house has specially compiled and printed a booklet of relevant documents for adoption in various regions. The retail price is 1,500 yuan per copy, and trade union organizations purchasing 50 or more copies will receive a special price of 1,000 yuan.

### 关于劳动政策的两大文件

专栏：

  　关于劳动政策的两大文件
　　中华全国总工会关于发动各地工会组织及广大工人群众讨论工会法草案的通知
　　中华人民共和国工会法草案
　　中央人民政府劳动部关于在私营企业中设立劳资协商会议的指示
　　有关劳动政策的两大文件（工人日报）
　　劳动政策与劳动部的任务（李立三）
　　中华人民工和国工会法草案是三十年来中国工人阶级在中国共产党与毛主席的英明领导下，所获得的最大的革命成果之一。在工会法草案中明确地规定了在新民主主义的政权下工会组织的法律地位与职责，充分地保障了中国工人阶级在组织工会与其他政治活动方面的自由权利。这是中国工人运动史上空前未有的一件大事情。中央人民政府政务院为了使工会法更臻完善起见，在中央人民政府委员会对于工会法未作最后修正通过前，故将工会法草案，先予发表，以便吸收各方面的意见，作最后的修正。中华全国总工会已通知各地区与产业工会组织的领导机关与负责同志，应根据工会法草案及工人日报社论“有关劳动政策的两大文件”，在工厂、矿山、商店、机关、农场、学校等工会组织内与广大工人群众中进行广泛而深入的宣传，展开热烈的讨论，本社特将有关文件辑印一册，供各地採用，零售每本一千五百元，工会组织购买五十本以上者，特价一千元。
