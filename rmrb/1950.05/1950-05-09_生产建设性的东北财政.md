　　Production and Construction-Oriented Northeast China Finances
　　By Our Special Correspondent Tian Liu
　　Northeast China's financial budget for 1950, including the task of remittance to the central government, has achieved a balance between revenue and expenditure. As far as the Northeast region itself is concerned, there is actually a surplus. This fact, occurring in a vast area with a population of 40 million, and in Northeast China, the country's main industrial base, is of even greater significance. Undoubtedly, it will have a huge impact and strong support for the country's financial and economic construction.
　　In 1950, Northeast China's financial revenue increased unprecedentedly: more than 30% higher than last year, and more than 1.2 times higher than in 1948. The People's Government never "increased revenue" and achieved "financial balance" by endlessly plundering the people, like the Chiang Kai-shek government; on the contrary, the Northeast People's Government achieved this by systematically and step-by-step reducing the burden on the people and improving their lives. The burden on the broad masses of people in recent years is a powerful proof: in 1948, the agricultural tax (public grain) paid by farmers accounted for 23% of their total harvest, but in 1949 it dropped to 19.5% (including local grain, it only accounted for 21% of their harvest). This is still calculated based on the normal yield of the land. If we add in by-products, the actual burden rate for farmers in 1949 was only 17.9% of their total income. What about the burden on urban industrialists and merchants? Taking Liaodong Province, which collected the most industrial and commercial tax and exceeded the original assigned task the most, as an example: in 1949, the industrial tax only accounted for 13.2% of their profits, and the commercial tax only accounted for 19.9% of their profits. This is not only much lighter than the burden borne by the farmers, who have been shouldering the entire financial, material, and human resource supply for the people's liberation cause for many years, but it is even lighter than the burden on farmers today—after the victory of the People's Liberation War!
　　National financial revenue increased, but the people's burden was reduced. The only reason is that production and the economy have developed. Due to the thorough implementation of land reform, farmers' enthusiasm for production is extremely high. Although Northeast China suffered from drought in the north and floods in the south last year, thanks to the active leadership of the People's Government and the hard work of the broad masses of farmers, the harvest still reached 90% of the planned output. This year, the output will be increased by 37% compared to last year, and the region will produce 18 million tons of grain; private industry and commerce have also achieved new development under the correct policy guidance of the government. Taking Shenyang City's industry as an example, in the first half of last year, there were 9,727 private factories in the city, which developed to 12,027 by the end of the year, and the number of workers also increased from the original 42,590 to 50,413. Due to the rapid development of production, the economy is becoming more and more prosperous, and the people's income is increasing day by day, so the burden is relatively reduced. However, one of the most important reasons is that state-owned enterprises have recovered extremely rapidly in recent years, especially last year, and the income of state-owned enterprises has become the largest part of the Northeast China's national financial revenue. This year, the profits (including depreciation) handed over to the state by state-owned enterprises reached 49.7% of the total financial revenue of Northeast China, which has exceeded the sum of public grain and taxes. (Public grain accounts for 19.5% of the total revenue budget, and taxes account for 25.49%, with a total of 44.99% of the total financial revenue.) This has greatly reduced the burden on the people.
　　If financial revenue is increased but not strictly managed and scientifically used, it will still cause serious financial disorder and huge deficits. The Northeast People's Government has made full considerations and precise calculations when using state assets. It resolutely saves what should be saved, and provides ample financial and material guarantees for the most urgent and important undertakings. The most obvious fact is the sharp reduction in military and administrative expenses and the sharp increase in investment in national economic construction in 1950. In 1949, military expenditure accounted for 41.21% of total financial expenditure, but this year it only accounts for 8.88%; administrative expenses have also been reduced from 7.71% last year to 5%. Investment in national economic construction has increased to 53% of total financial expenditure, of which industrial investment accounts for 41% of total revenue—which provides a full material guarantee for the construction of the industrial base that guarantees China's prosperity and strength.
　　Regarding the people's cultural construction undertakings, the Northeast People's Government also gives the greatest possible attention. This year, 6.9% of the total budget will be used to run cultural, educational, and social health undertakings, of which the funding for university education has doubled compared to last year. This is determined by the needs of large-scale economic construction. This year, Northeast China will focus on developing regular engineering universities and training a large number of industrial and technical talents.
　　Northeast China's financial construction plan—the 1950 financial budget—is not a beautiful fantasy or a promise on paper. It is formulated based on the guidelines and policies stipulated in the Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and based on the actual situation and the principle of need and possibility in Northeast China. Therefore, it should and can be realized. The implementation in the past three months has proved this point. The first quarter's financial revenue plan: in terms of state-owned enterprises, although the numbers were not accurately determined at the beginning of the year, and there were some changes later, so that it could not be completed according to the original number, it has collected 18% of the annual plan; laying a preliminary foundation and a better start. Other incomes have been completed and exceeded the plan: such as tax revenue completed 144.4% of the original plan, public grain exceeded the plan by 9.7%, and public debt exceeded the plan by 30%. In terms of financial expenditure, the first priority is to ensure investment in economic construction, especially investment in industrial construction. The first quarter—only the preparation period for capital construction—has allocated 19% of the total annual industrial investment. Other investments such as agriculture, forestry, highway transportation, and municipal construction have also reached more than 20% of the total annual investment.
　　It is not to say that Northeast China's finances have been smooth sailing, and there are no more difficulties. Difficulties are still great, and continued unremitting efforts are needed to overcome them. The basic difficulties, such as the fact that the war has not ended for long, and the national economy has not fully recovered, will not be mentioned for the time being. The "second quarter" in front of Northeast China's finances is a big difficulty. The second quarter is when tax revenue enters the off-season, and income decreases, while large-scale economic construction—especially the construction of industrial capital construction projects, has generally begun with the arrival of spring. The second quarter is a quarter in which industrial investment and other expenditures increase, and must be issued in a timely manner. If it is not handled well, the entire budget will be in danger of being breached. To this end, the Finance Department of the Northeast People's Government has taken various measures, such as ensuring tax revenue in the off-season, consolidating and developing the profit income of public enterprises, using clearing of material warehouses, accelerating material supply and turnover, strictly compiling, and careful calculation, etc., to achieve the goal of increasing income, reducing expenditure, and achieving a balance between financial revenue and expenditure. In order to realize effective supervision by the state over various financial investments and expenditures, so as to rationally and appropriately use state financial resources, the Northeast People's Government has clearly stipulated: strictly establishing and accurately implementing the financial budget and final accounting system has become the basic financial discipline. Once the budget is reviewed and approved, no agency, department, or enterprise may change it at will; financial departments and financial accounting units at all levels must also prepare revenue and expenditure final accounts on the prescribed date; the financial supervision system has been initially established and is still continuing to conduct on-site inspections, and has received many benefits.
　　One of the obvious characteristics of Northeast China's financial construction is that its income is mainly the profits turned over by state-owned enterprises, and its expenditure is mainly used for national economic construction and cultural undertakings that benefit the people. It is the beginning of a truly production and construction-oriented finance, which has never happened in Chinese history. With the victorious end of the war, under the instruction of Chairman Mao, the Northeast People's Government promptly transformed the war-supply finance into a production-construction finance. The implementation and implementation of this correct policy has enabled the recovery and reconstruction of the Northeast China's national economy to obtain a solid financial and material guarantee. The brave and hardworking working class and the broad masses of farmers in Northeast China will make the total output value of state-owned industry as high as 193% of last year, and the agricultural output will increase by 37% compared to last year. The rapid recovery and reconstruction of the national economy, and the rapid upsurge of industrial and agricultural production, will inevitably lead to a new upsurge in the people's economic and cultural lives.

　　生产建设性的东北财政
    本报特派记者  田流
    一九五○年东北的财政预算，连解交中央的任务在内，已达到收支平衡。如从东北区本身来说，实际上已有盈余。这一事实发生在拥有四千万人口的广大区域，发生在我国主要的工业基地的东北区，更有重要的意义。毫无疑问，它对全国的财政建设和经济建设将发生巨大的影响和有力的援助。
    一九五○年，东北区的财政收入有了空前的增加：比去年增加了百分之三○以上，比一九四八年增加了一·二倍多。人民政府决不是像蒋介石政府那样，以无止境的搜括人民，来“增加收入”，达到“财政收支平衡”的；恰恰相反，东北人民政府是在有系统、有步骤的减轻人民负担，改善人民生活中实现的。几年来广大人民的负担情形，可作有力的证明：一九四八年农民交纳的农业税——公粮，相当其全部收获量的百分之廿三，一九四九年就降到了百分之十九·五了（连地方粮在内，也仅占其收获量的百分之廿一）。这还是以土地的正产物计算的。如果加上副产品，一九四九年农民的实际负担率，则仅占其总收入的百分之十七·九。城市工商业者的负担怎样呢？以工商业税征得量最多，超过原分配任务最多的辽东省为例：一九四九年工业税仅占其利润的百分之十三·二，商业税也只占其利润的百分之十九·九。这不仅比多少年来一直担负着人民解放事业全部财力、物力、人力供应的农民轻得多，甚至比今天——人民解放战争胜利结束后的农民负担还轻！
    国家财政收入增加，人民负担反而减轻。唯一的原因是生产和经济发展了。由于彻底实现了土地改革，农民的生产情绪异常高涨。去年东北虽然北旱南涝，但在人民政府积极领导，广大农民的辛勤劳动下，收成仍然达到了计划产量的百分之九○。今年更要比去年提高百分之卅七的产量，全区将产粮一八○○万吨；私人工商业也在政府正确的政策指导下，获得了新的发展。以沈阳市工业为例，去年前半年该市有九七二七家私营工厂，到年底就发展到一二○二七家，工人也由原来的四二五九○人，增加到五○四一三人。由于生产的迅速发展，经济一天比一天繁荣，人民的收入日益增加，负担就相对的减轻了。但是，最重要的原因之一，是几年来、特别是去年国营企业有了极迅速的恢复，国营企业的收入已成为东北区国家财政收入中的最大部分。今年国营企业向国家交纳的利润（包括折旧费），达到东北区全部财政岁入的百分之四九·七，已超过了公粮与税收的总和。（公粮占全部岁入预算的百分之十九·五，税收占百分之二十五·四九，两项合计共占财政总收入的百分之四四·九九。）这就极大的减轻了人民的负担。
    财政收入增加之后，如果不加严格的管理和科学的运用，仍会造成严重的财政紊乱和巨大的赤字。东北人民政府在运用国家资财时，进行了充分的考虑和精密的计算。将应该节省的坚决节省下来，对最急需最重要的事业，则给予充裕的财力物力保证。最显明的事实是一九五○年的军政费用的急骤缩减，和国民经济建设投资的急骤增加。一九四九年军事费占全部财政支出的百分之四一·二一，今年仅占百分之八·八八；行政费用也由去年的百分之七·七一降低到百分之五。国民经济建设的投资则升涨到全部财政支出的百分之五十三，其中工业投资即达全部岁出的百分之四十一——这就使那保证我国走向繁荣强大的工业基地的建设，获得了充分的物质保证。
    关于人民的文化建设事业，东北人民政府也给予可能的最大的重视。今年将以全部预算的百分之六·九，兴办文化教育和社会卫生事业，其中大学教育的经费比去年增加了一倍。这是大规模的经济建设需要决定的，今年东北区将要着重的发展正规的工科大学，大量培养工业技术人材。
    东北区的财政建设计划——一九五○年度的财政预算，并不是美丽的幻想和纸上的诺言，它是根据人民政治协商会议共同纲领所规定的方针政策，根据东北区的实际情况和需要与可能的原则制订的，因此它是应该和能够实现的。三个月来执行的情况，已经证明这一点。第一季度的财政收入计划：在国营企业方面，虽因年初确定数字不精确，尔后又有些变动，以致未能按原数完成，但已收起全年计划的百分之十八；打下初步的基础与较好的开端。其他收入皆已完成并超过了计划：如税收完成原计划的百分之一四四·四，公粮超过计划百分之九·七，公债超过计划百分之三十。在财政支出方面，首先是保证了经济建设投资，特别是工业建设的投资。第一季度——只是基本建设的准备时期——已拨付全年工业投资总额的百分之十九。其他如农林、公路交通、市政建设等投资，也已达到全年投资总额的百分之二○以上。
    并不是说，东北区的财政已经是一帆风顺，再也没有什么困难了，困难依然是很大的，还需要继续进行不懈的努力才能克服。基本的困难如战争结束不久，国民经济还没有完全恢复等等姑且不说，摆在东北财政面前的“第二季度”就是个很大的困难。第二季度正是税收进入淡季，收入减少，而大规模的经济建设——尤其是工业基本建设工程的修建，随着春天的到来，已经普遍开始。第二季度是工业投资及其他开支加大，而又要及时发出的季度，如掌握不好，整个预算就有被冲破的危险。为此，东北人民政府财政部已采取种种措置，如保证淡季税收、巩固和发展公营企业利润收入，运用清查物资仓库，加速物资供应与周转、严格编制、精打细算等等，以达到增加收入，压缩支出，实现财政收支平衡的目的。为着实现国家对于各种财政投资与支出的有效监督，以便合理恰当的运用国家财力，东北人民政府已经明确规定：以严格建立和准确执行财政预决算制度，成为基本的财政纪律。预算既经审核批准后，任何机关、部门、企业不得随意变更；各级财政部门和财政计算单位，并须按规定的日期编制收支决算；财政监察制度已经初步的建立起来，进行了仍在继续进行着现地检查，且已收到不少效果。
    东北区的财政建设明显的特征之一，是它的收入是主要国营企业的解交利润，它的支出又主要是用于造福人民的国民经济建设和文化事业，是名符其实的生产建设性的财政的开端，这是中国历史上从来没有过的事情。随着战争的胜利结束，东北人民政府在毛主席的指示下，及时的将战争供给性的财政，转变为生产建设性的财政，这一正确方针的执行和贯彻，就使得东北区的国民经济的恢复与重建，获得了坚固的财力物力保证。勇敢勤劳的东北工人阶级和广大农民，今年将使国营工业的生产总值高达去年百分之一九三，农业的生产量将比去年增加百分之三十七，国民经济的迅速恢复与重建，工农业生产的迅速高涨，必然会引起人民的经济生活与文化生活的新高涨。
