Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 29th (TASS): The Red Star newspaper commentator wrote about the preparations for May Day celebrations in the People's Democratic countries, stating: The working people of the People's Democratic countries, following the example of the Soviet Union in welcoming May Day with new victories and achievements of hundreds of millions of builders of communist society, are welcoming May Day with their achievements, especially those achieved in the most important front of socialist construction—the restoration and development of the national economy.

Under the leadership of unified workers' parties, and after overcoming various obstacles left by the capitalist system, the oil workers of Romania, the workers in the machine manufacturing industry of Czechoslovakia, the miners of Poland, the construction workers of Hungary, and the agricultural workers of Bulgaria are all summing up their achievements.

The working people of New China, who are welcoming their first May Day since China's liberation from the oppression of imperialists and their lackeys, have launched large-scale labor competitions. The Chinese working class has demonstrated with labor achievements that the creative possibilities of free people are unlimited and cannot be restricted in any way. The entire country is filled with unprecedented labor enthusiasm. Miners in the suburbs of Beijing have reduced coal production costs; workers in Northeast China have also provided proof that they have implemented thousands of suggestions for accelerating production in a short period.

The young Bulgarian industry is gradually becoming a solid foundation for the development of the Bulgarian economy, especially agriculture, and it is developing at an unprecedented rate in this formerly backward agricultural country. Bulgarian industry has exceeded the plan for the first quarter of this year by 2.7 percent.

Romania completed 108 percent of its 1949 national economic plan in terms of industrial output, which is an important achievement of the working people of the Romanian People's Republic.

Selfless labor and creative initiative in mastering new production methods have enabled industrial workers in Czechoslovakia to achieve brilliant successes, exceeding the March plan by 5.2 percent.

In Albania, where there was previously not a single large industrial enterprise, factories are currently being built, which will fundamentally change the country's national economy.

The achievements of the workers, peasants, and intellectuals of the People's Democratic countries constitute an important factor in consolidating the world peace camp. These achievements once again prove the unwavering will of the working people of these countries to move towards socialism.

　　人民民主国家劳动人民以生产成就庆祝五一节
     红星报评论指出：这些成就构成了巩固世界和平阵营的重要因素
    【新华社三十日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十九日讯：红星报评论员就人民民主国家筹备庆祝五一节情况撰文称：人民民主国家的劳动人民，效法以亿万共产主义社会建设者的新胜利与成就来迎接五一节的苏联的先例，以他们所获得的成就，特别是在社会主义建设最重要的战线——在恢复与发展国民经济方面——所获得的那些成就，来迎接五一节。
    在统一的工人政党领导下，并且在越过资本主义制度所遗留的各种阻碍之后，罗马尼亚的石油工人，捷克斯洛伐克的机器制造业的工人，波兰的矿工，匈牙利的建筑工人，保加利亚的农业工作者都正在总结他们的成就。
    新中国的劳动人民，正在迎接中国自帝国主义者及其从仆的压迫下解放后的第一个五一节，已经展开了大规模的劳动竞赛。中国的工人阶级以劳动业绩说明了自由人民的创造可能性是无限的，而且是不可能有任何限制的。整个国家到处都洋溢着前所未有的劳动热情。北京郊区矿工，减低了煤产成本；中国东北的工人也提供了证明他们在短短的期间就实施了数以千计的加速生产的建议。
    年青的保加利亚工业，逐渐变成保国经济、尤其是农业发展的坚固基础，它正在这个曾经是落后的农业国以空前的速度发展着。保加利亚工业已超过本年第一季计划百分之二点七。
    罗马尼亚一九四九年的国民经济计划，在工业产量方面完成了百分之一○八，这是罗马尼亚人民共和国劳动人民重要的成就。
    忘我的劳动和在精通新生产方法上的创造的主动性，使捷克斯洛伐克产业工人获得了辉煌的成就，他们超过了三月份计划的百分之五点二。
    在阿尔巴尼亚，以前根本没有一家大型工业企业，目前则正在建筑工厂，这将使该国国民经济根本改变。
    人民民主国家的工人、农民和知识分子所获的成就，构成了巩固世界和平阵营的重要因素。这些成就又一次证明了这些国家劳动人民向社会主义迈进的坚定不移的意志。
