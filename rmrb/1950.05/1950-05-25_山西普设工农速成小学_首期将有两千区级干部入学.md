Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 18th -- In order to improve the cultural and political-ideological level of district-level worker-peasant cadres, the Shanxi Provincial People's Government has ordered the Taiyuan Municipal Government and all special districts to establish worker-peasant rapid course elementary schools. The first cohort will include 2,300 district-level cadres from across the province. Worker-peasant rapid course elementary schools in Yuci, Xinxian, Yuncheng, Changzhi, Taiyuan and other locations have now officially begun classes. Linfen, Fenyang, Xingxian and other counties are also actively preparing and will soon begin classes. The Shanxi Provincial People's Government promulgated implementation measures on April 25th, stipulating that each special district establish one worker-peasant elementary school. The content of education will focus on improving culture, supplemented by a certain amount of current events and policy education. The student admission requirements are determined to be incumbent cadres at the district level with more than one year of service, who are healthy and have potential for development. The academic system is divided into primary and advanced levels, with a study period of one and a half years for each. Each half year is one semester, and each level is divided into classes according to proficiency, with a limit of fifty students per class. Worker-peasant rapid course elementary schools must implement planned teaching based on the teaching principles and the students' proficiency. Establish a regular system of examinations, promotion, retention, and transfer. At the same time, in the class assignment method, Chinese language and general political knowledge will be used as the standard, and when the level of Chinese language and arithmetic are not compatible, students can be assigned to different levels or classes separately. The teaching time is twenty-four hours per week for classes and self-study, and the number of class weeks per semester cannot be less than twenty-three weeks. In addition, it is stipulated that students must pass all course examinations before being issued a graduation certificate. Those who fail one subject will be allowed to graduate temporarily, and will conduct remedial studies in their work, and apply for a make-up examination within one year. Those who fail two subjects will continue to study. During the study period, no department may transfer students midway without approval from the provincial government.
