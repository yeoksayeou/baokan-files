　　Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The rent reduction and rent investigation campaign in the semi-old liberated areas of Suiyuan Province (referring to the areas of Sui East and Sui South, liberated in 1948) has completely concluded. The broad masses of farmers are now actively turning to spring plowing and production. The Sui East and Sui South areas of the province began rent reduction in some villages as early as last spring. However, due to the rapid transition to spring plowing, it could not be fully completed at that time. By December of last year, a larger-scale rent reduction movement was universally launched in the Sui East and Sui South areas. At the same time, rent investigation work was also carried out in villages where rent reduction had already been implemented in the spring. After several months of effort, the rent reduction and rent investigation movement in the aforementioned areas has now completely concluded. According to statistics from more than 120 villages in Fengzhen, Liangcheng, and other counties, farmers have recovered a total of 5,010 *shi* of grain from rent reductions, which has partially resolved the production and livelihood difficulties of poor tenant farmers. It has also weakened the feudal exploitation system and prepared the mass conditions for future land reform work.

　　Before the start of the rent reduction and rent investigation movement in these areas, the counties generally convened cadre meetings, county, district, and village people's representative conferences, and farmer representative conferences to publicize and discuss rent reduction policies. This stabilized the production sentiments of various classes and overcame the erroneous thinking of some cadres who felt that rent reduction was not as satisfying as land distribution and therefore underestimated rent reduction. In conducting the work, various localities first carried out key experiments, and then promoted them comprehensively. When Wu Dong County carried out rent reduction in key villages, it invited village representatives and activists from other villages to participate, quickly promoting the rent reduction movement in 32 surrounding villages, thereby solving the difficulties of scattered areas and a shortage of cadres.

　　During the movement, various localities used reasonable and legal struggle methods. Individual despotic landlords who were hated by the masses were handed over to the government for disposal in accordance with the law, ensuring that the movement advanced steadily throughout and that no chaos occurred.

　　During the rent reduction movement, the awareness of farmers was generally raised. Many farmers who had been deceived into participating in superstitious organizations in the past voluntarily withdrew from religious sects and joined their own farmers' associations. In Shengchengyao Village, Liangcheng Sixth District alone, more than 400 farmers voluntarily withdrew from "Yiguandao" and requested to join the farmers' association. The organization of farmers' associations has greatly developed, with new members in Liangcheng County alone reaching more than 20,000. Local people's governments have also promoted more than 80 activists who emerged from the movement to serve as district and village cadres. Many outstanding farmers have also gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. The militia forces in many villages have also grown stronger and have taken the initiative to cooperate with the troops in searching for and suppressing bandits.

　　The production enthusiasm of farmers in the rent-reduced areas has generally increased. Farmers in most villages have delivered manure to the fields ahead of schedule. Farmers in Naobao Village, Liangcheng, began to release water for irrigation as early as the third day of the new year.

### 绥远半老区结束减租  广大农民转入春耕

　　绥远半老区结束减租
    广大农民转入春耕
    【新华社七日讯】绥远省半老区（指一九四八年解放的绥东、绥南地区）的减租、查租运动已经全部结束，广大农民现正积极转入春耕生产。该省绥东、绥南地区早于去年春季即在部分村庄开始进行减租，当时因很快转入春耕，未能全部完成。到去年十二月，较大规模的减租运动就在绥东绥南地区普遍展开，同时春季已进行过减租的村庄也进行了查租工作。经过几个月的努力，上述地区的减租和查租运动现已全部结束。据丰镇、凉城等县一百二十余村的统计，农民从减租中共退回租粮五千零十大石，部分解决了贫苦佃农的生产和生活困难，同时削弱了封建剥削制度，并为今后的土地改革工作准备了群众条件。
    这些地区的减租和查租运动开始前，各县大都召开了干部会，县、区、村各界人民代表会和农民代表会，宣传和讨论减租的政策。这就稳定了各阶层的生产情绪，克服了部分干部认为减租不如分配土地痛快而轻视减租的错误思想。各地进行工作中首先作重点试验，然后向全面推广。武东县在重点村进行减租时，曾经邀请其他村子的村代表和积极分子参加，很快就推动周围三十二个村的减租运动，从而解决了地区分散和干部少的困难。
    运动中各地都运用了合理合法的斗争方法，对个别为群众痛恨的恶霸地主则依法交政府处理，保证了运动始终稳步前进，未发生任何混乱现象。
    在减租运动中农民的觉悟普遍提高，不少过去受骗参加迷信组织的农民，纷纷自动退出道门，参加到自己的农会里来。仅凉城六区省城窑一村，即有四百余农民自动退出“一贯道”，要求加入农会。农会组织有了很大发展，凉城一县新会员即达二万余人。各地人民政府并从运动中涌现出的大批积极分子中提拔了八十余人当区村干部。不少优秀农民并光荣地参加了中国共产党。许多村庄的民兵武装也已壮大起来，并主动配合部队进行搜剿土匪的工作。
    经过减租地区的农民生产情绪普遍提高，大部村庄的农民都提前把粪送到地里。凉城脑包村农民旧年初三就开始放水浇地。
