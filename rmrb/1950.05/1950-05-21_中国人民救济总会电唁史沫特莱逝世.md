Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th: The China People's Relief Association has telegraphed the American Democratic Far Eastern Policy Committee, offering condolences on the passing of Ms. Agnes Smedley. The telegram reads as follows:

To the American Democratic Far Eastern Policy Committee:

All colleagues of the China People's Relief Association express our deepest condolences on the passing of Ms. Agnes Smedley.

Ms. Smedley was one of the true friends of the Chinese people. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, she actively helped Chinese revolutionaries and progressives in Shanghai under the threat and surveillance of imperialist elements and Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents. In the early days of the War of Resistance, she launched the Guerrilla Donation Committee in Wuhan, actively supporting the military and civilians who persisted in fighting the enemy behind enemy lines with medicine and relief. Ms. Smedley was a true and excellent representative of the American people. We express our boundless anger at the American imperialists who persecuted her to death.

Although Ms. Smedley has passed away, her sincere love for the Chinese people will forever live in the hearts of the Chinese people.

                                    China People's Relief Association
                                  May 19, 1950

　　中国人民救济总会电唁史沫特莱逝世
    【新华社北京二十日电】中国人民救济总会顷致电美国民主远东政策委员会，吊唁史沫特莱女士的病逝。电文如下：美国民主远东政策委员会：
    中国人民救济总会全体同事谨以最沉痛的心情哀悼史沫特莱女士的病逝。
    史沫特莱女士是中国人民的真正友人之一。抗日战争前，她就在帝国主义分子和蒋匪特务的威胁和监视下，在上海积极地救助过中国的革命者和进步人士；抗战初期，她在武汉发动组织游击队募捐委员会，在医药和救济方面积极支援坚持敌后抗战的军民。史沫特莱女士是美国人民的真正的优秀的代表，我们对迫害她致死的美帝国主义表示无限的愤怒。
    史沫特莱女士虽然死去，但她对中国人民的真挚的友爱永远活在中国人民的心里。
                                    中国人民救济总会
                                  一九五○年五月十九日
