　　Unite with Capitalists to Improve Production
    Introduction to the Work of the Party Branch of the Private Xingdong Oil Company
    Wang Lin
    The private Xingdong Oil Company is one of the larger of the eight oil mills in Harbin. The factory currently has 130 employees, including 19 Communist Party members. Because the Party branch led the workers in implementing the policy of benefiting both labor and capital and developing production, the factory completed the crash processing task assigned by the Dongxing Company in 1949. In May, the factory was selected as a second-class production model in the oil mill industry.

    Before June 1949, the capitalist adopted a "maintain the status quo" attitude towards the factory and was unwilling to invest capital to expand production. The urgent processing task assigned by Dongxing Company required double shifts to complete, but the capitalist refused to agree to overtime work under the pretext of not being able to find skilled (master) workers, because less oil extraction meant less profit (shorter pressing time). At this time, the branch took the initiative to consult with the trade union and decided to: on the one hand, mobilize all workers to overcome difficulties, and select 13 people from the more skilled junior workers to become master workers; on the other hand, find some workers from outside to supplement the junior workers. This forced the capitalist to agree to double-shift processing, resulting in early completion of the processing task.

    On June 24, 1949, a fire broke out in the factory warehouse. Party member Wei Tianju, fearing that the fire would spread to the oil pressing plant, risked his life to remove the roof of the warehouse, almost being knocked down by the fire. Workers risked their lives to rescue 300 sacks, 120 bags of white flour, and 1,800 catties of rice. The day after the fire, the branch and the trade union went to the capitalist to discuss the restoration of the warehouse. At that time, the capitalist was somewhat disheartened upon seeing the large losses (three warehouses burned down, worth about 800 million Northeast currency), and raised two difficulties: first, the factory did not have much cash, and wages were to be paid in three or four days, so there was not enough money to repair the warehouse and buy materials; second, the factory director had been sent to court and there was no one to make a construction plan. In this situation, the branch, together with the trade union and all employees, discussed and proposed a solution: decide to repair the warehouse first and then pay wages, in order to solve the financial difficulties. At the same time, in order to take care of production, the trade union requested the court to grant the factory director a suspended sentence. With the help of Dongxing Company (providing some soybeans for processing), the factory was able to resume work. But there were obstacles when starting work. The boiler chimney had to be swept; it could not be started without sweeping. In the past, it took half a month to sweep it when it was cold, and now it was even more difficult because the boiler was very hot. At this time, branch secretary Comrade Xiu Longqi wrapped a few hemp bags around himself and took the lead in entering the boiler to sweep it, followed by trade union cadres. The exemplary actions of the Party members were actively responded to by all the workers. What used to take half a month was completely swept in less than a day this time. In the production process, it was discovered that the quality was not as good as that of the Tongchenghe Oil Mill. The branch organized trade union cadres to visit Tongchenghe to learn from their methods and improve the quality. Party member workers worked together to study technology, which resulted in one or two taels more oil being produced per hundred catties of soybeans. With an average of 150,000 catties of soybeans processed per day, 150 catties more of soybean oil was produced. The oil extraction rate increased by 16 percent compared to 1948. This gradually strengthened the capitalist's confidence in management, and the capitalist continued to invest more than 2.5 billion yuan in the factory to expand production, repair the burned warehouses, add double-cylinder boiler chimneys, large oil storage tanks (capacity of 165 catties), brick warehouses (capable of holding 200 cartloads of soybeans), and build worker dormitories, employee clubs, and meeting rooms. There were also plans to build a large soybean transport machine in 1950.

    At the beginning of this year, the Northeast Grain Company assigned an urgent processing task. In order to complete the processing task on short notice, the work was changed to three shifts a day, but the output decreased a lot, with more than 700 catties less of soybean oil produced each day. After the branch discovered this problem, in order to reduce waste, increase output, and consolidate the capitalist's management morale, the branch secretary personally started to study improvement methods. He worked at the soybean drying bed for two days. With the efforts of Party members, all workers, and the capitalist, the reason for the low output was finally found: the soybean pieces were too uniform, the soybean drying bed was too thick, etc. After these problems were discovered, methods were immediately found to correct them, which increased output and encouraged the production morale of the capitalist and workers.

    In order to improve production, the branch not only paid attention to uniting with the capitalist, but also adopted appropriate methods to persuade and correct the capitalist's wrong actions. When settling accounts in 1948, the capitalist convened a workers' meeting without going through the trade union and announced who would be rewarded how much. The branch immediately coordinated with the trade union to explain that this behavior would affect worker unity, and negotiated with the capitalist to explain that it was best to reward workers through the trade union. The opinions of the branch and the trade union were supported by the workers, and the capitalist also believed that this approach was correct.

    Sometimes the capitalist was dissatisfied with the government's tax policy and would say to the workers that the factory earned a lot of money, but it was all taken away by the government in taxes. After hearing these words, the branch immediately explained the situation to the workers and also explained and publicized the policy to the capitalist.

    The branch also carried out persuasive education on some of the workers' excessive welfare demands. In June 1948, the workers demanded a bonus for the settlement of accounts (a disguised form of profit sharing). The branch and the trade union explained to the workers that this kind of demand was not in line with the long-term interests of the working class, and educated the workers to recognize that the primary task at present was to improve production. When production develops, the lives of the workers will naturally improve. Although we get some benefits from dividing some of the profits now, the result will affect the capitalist's enthusiasm for production and increase difficulties for the development of the factory, which is also unfavorable to the workers. When signing the labor-capital collective contract, the branch explained the significance of the collective contract to the workers, dispelled the workers' distrust of their own rights and fear of being dismissed, and the idea of asking for more severance pay. It also led the workers to put forward demands that were in line with the specific situation of the factory and in line with the interests of the working class, as content of the contract, and guaranteed the welfare signing of the collective contract.

    Under possible conditions, the branch promoted the trade union and the factory to solve many welfare problems for the workers, such as repairing worker dormitories. In addition, it also requested the capitalist to distribute 500 catties of waste oil grass to everyone every half month as a fuel subsidy. For elderly workers such as Qi Jintang and others who could not do heavy work, the branch suggested that the capitalist let them switch to light work. Because the branch promoted the trade union to care about the lives of the workers, most of the workers were able to work with peace of mind and actively responded to the call of the Party and the trade union.

　　团结资方搞好生产
    私营兴东制油公司支部工作介绍
    王琳
    私营兴东制油公司，是哈市八个油坊中较大的一个。全厂现有员工一百三十名。中共党员十九名。由于党的支部领导工人贯彻了劳资两利、发展生产的政策，在一九四九年完成了东兴公司给予的突击性的加工任务，五月间该工厂被选为油坊业的二等生产模范。
    一九四九年六月前，资方对工厂采取维持现状的态度，不愿投入资本扩大生产。东兴公司交来的紧急加工任务，须双班才能完成。但资方因为出油少不能多得利润（压垛时间短），便以找不到技术（大工）工人为借口而不肯加班。这时支部便主动和工会商量，决定：一方面动员全体工友起来克服困难，从技术较好的小工里提出十三名做大工；另一方面从外边找来些工人以补充小工之不足。这样使得资方不得不答应双班加工。结果提前完成了加工任务。
    一九四九年六月二十四日，工厂仓库着火。党员魏天聚怕火烧到榨油厂，便不顾生命危险去起仓库房盖，几乎被火掀下来。工友们冒着火抢出了三百条麻袋，一百二十袋白面，一千八百斤大米。失火的第二天，支部与工会去找资方商量恢复仓库的事情，当时资方看到损失太大（烧掉三个仓库、约值东北币八亿左右），有些灰心丧气，并提出了两项困难：第一、工厂现款不多，再过三四天要发工资，修理仓库买材料钱不够；第二、厂长被送法院没人作修建计划。在这种情况下，支部同工会和全体职工共同商量后，提出了解决办法：决定先修仓库后发工资，以解决资金困难。同时工会为了照顾生产，呈请法院给厂长缓刑处理。加上东兴公司的帮助（给一部分豆子加工），工厂始得复工。但开工时又遇到障碍，锅炉大烟筒要刷扫，不刷不能开工，从前在冷时扫完也得半个月，而现在锅炉很热，扫起来就更感到困难。这时支部书记修龙奇同志便围了几条麻袋带头钻进锅炉去刷扫，接着工会干部也相继钻进去刷扫。党员的模范行动得到全体工人的积极响应，过去须作半个月的工作，这次不到一天工夫就全部刷扫完毕。在生产过程中，发现了质量不如同成和油坊的好，支部便组织工会干部去同成和参观，学习了同成和的作法，提高了质量。党员工友又共同努力钻研技术，使每百斤豆子多出了一两油。每天平均作十五万斤豆子，多产一百五十斤豆油。榨油率比一九四八年增加了百分之十六。这样就逐渐加强了资方的经营信心，资方继续向工厂投入资本二十五亿余元，扩大生产，修复烧掉的仓库，并增设了双筒锅炉烟筒，大油囤（容量一六五斤），砖仓库（能装二百车豆子），并修建了工人宿舍、职工俱乐部和会议室等，还计划在一九五○年设一个大运豆机。
    今年年初，东北粮食公司交来了紧急加工任务。为了突击完成加工任务，改为每天三班工作，但产量随之降低很多。每天少出豆油七百余斤。支部发现这个问题后，为减少浪费，提高产量和巩固资方经营情绪，支部书记亲自动手研究改进办法。他在豆炕作了两天工作。在党员和全体工人及资方的努力下，终于找出了产量不高的原因：就是豆匹子太整，豆炕铺的厚等。发现这些问题后，马上设法改正，提高了产量，鼓励了资方和工人的生产情绪。
    为了搞好生产，支部不但注意团结资方，同时对资方的错误行动也采取了适当的方法，进行说服纠正。一九四八年结账时，资方未通过工会就召开工人大会，宣布奖这个多少、赏那个多少，支部即时协同工会说明这种行为会影响工人团结，并同资方协商说明奖励工人最好通过工会。支部和工会意见得到了工人的拥护，资方也认为这样的作法是对的。
    有时资方对政府的税收政策不满，便向工人说工厂挣钱不少都被政府收税收去了等。支部听到这些话后马上向工人进行解释，也对资方进行解释与宣传。
    支部对于工人某些过高的福利要求，也进行了说服教育。一九四八年六月，工人要求结账的奖励金（变相的分红）。支部和工会向工人解释此种要求是不符合工人阶级的长远利益的。教育工友认识到目前首要的任务就是搞好生产。生产发展了，工人的生活自然也就会好的。我们现在分了一些红，虽然目前得到一点好处，但结果将影响资方的生产积极性，为工厂的发展增加困难，对于工人来说同样也是不利的。订立劳资集体合同时，支部向工人解释了集体合同的意义，打消了工人不相信自己的权利因而怕解雇，多要解雇金的思想。又领导工人提出了合乎工厂具体情况，合乎工人阶级利益的要求，作为合同内容，保证了集体合同的福利签订。
    在可能的条件下，支部推动了工会和厂方给工人解决了很多福利问题。如修理工人宿舍等。此外，并要求资方每半月给大家分五百斤废油草作为补助燃料。老年工友齐金堂等四名作不动重活，支部建议资方让他们改作轻活。由于支部推动工会关心工人生活，使多数工友都安心生产，并积极响应党与工会的号召。
