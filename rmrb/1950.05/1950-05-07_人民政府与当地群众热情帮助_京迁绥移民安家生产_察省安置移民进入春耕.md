　　People's Government and Local Masses Enthusiastically Help
    Beijing Migrants Settle Down and Produce in Suiyuan, Chahar Province Arranges Migrants to Enter Spring Ploughing
    [Gui Sui News] The four thousand three hundred migrants who moved from Beijing to Suiyuan in several batches have all settled down and started spring ploughing with the help of the local people's government and the masses. Counties such as Jining, Liangcheng, Fengzhen, and Longsheng prepared all the utensils and houses before the arrival of the migrants. When the migrants arrived, welcome meetings were held in the villages where they were settled, and the long-term residents gave them firewood and food. At the welcome meeting for migrants settling in Shitougou Village, Fengzhen, the long-term residents voluntarily collected 230 jin of potatoes and 36 bundles of firewood. The district allocated some naked oats to the migrants as rations. As the migrants did not know how to grind them, the men, women, and primary school students in the village helped them. Fengzhen District Three has allocated ten mu of land to the migrants and is preparing to allocate another twenty mu. Liangcheng County's Chengjiaying Village and other villages organized a production committee to teach migrants production techniques and organize labor exchange. Thanks to the help of local people's governments, village cadres, and the masses, the migrants quickly started production. Zhang Biru, Zhang Hongxi, and Ge Tingyi, migrants who settled in Jining County, borrowed furniture and collected firewood the day after they arrived. Shao Xiquan, a migrant in District Five, can dig up 40 to 50 jin of grass roots every day, which can be exchanged for five or six jin of naked oats. Four migrant households in Chengjiaying administrative village, District Three of Liangcheng, have eight male laborers who can chop eight or nine hundred jin of firewood every day. To facilitate their agricultural production, the village allocated 93 mu of irrigated land to them from the land that was wrongly taken by the landlords in 1946, and solved their seed problem from the rent reduction grain. They have already set out a production plan and a mutually beneficial labor exchange with the long-term residents. They chop firewood, deliver manure, and pull plows for the long-term residents, who in turn cultivate the land for the migrants and teach them farming techniques. Chen Zhanbao, a migrant who settled in Kongdulin Village, Longsheng, started running transportation as soon as he arrived. As of March this year, he had earned one shi and two dou of naked oats, three shi and nine dou of wheat, and one shi and one dou of miscellaneous grains. He bought a cow and farm tools, and plans to reclaim twelve mu of wasteland before the beginning of summer. Together with the thirty mu of land the government allocated to him and the five mu he is cultivating for others, he will have more than forty mu of land. He is now cooperating with Dong Quan, exchanging cattle labor for manual labor, and Dong Quan is sowing seeds for him. He plans to plant eighteen mu of wheat this year, and seven mu have already been planted. The migrants have received warm help from the people's government and long-term residents, and feel warm, which has increased their confidence in developing production and becoming prosperous. The migrants have been writing letters to their relatives and friends in Beijing. The letter from Zhao Quanhe and six others, migrants in District Three of Jining County, said: "Although this place borders the grassland, the people are kind and loving, and the government and long-term residents take good care of us. We are determined to work hard here to produce and live a good life!"
    [This newspaper's news] According to the Chahar Daily: The migration from Beijing and Tianjin to Chahar Province started on March 30th and ended on April 21st this year, with a total of 3,828 migrants. The people's governments of Beijing and Tianjin provided sufficient travel expenses and sent cadres and doctors to accompany them by train to Chahar Province, where they were accommodated by the immigration reception stations in Chabei and Datong respectively. According to the migrants' wishes, they were settled in various counties in Chabei and Yanbei, and the government was responsible for sending them to the settlement sites. The migrants have now safely arrived in their respective settlement villages.
    In order to ensure that the resettlement of migrants is carried out effectively, that they quickly enter spring ploughing, and that they lay the foundation for long-term settlement, the provincial government has instructed all counties to solve the specific difficulties of migrants in spring ploughing and has stipulated concrete measures. The Chabei Prefectural Commissioner's Office has issued more than 134,000 jin of production loan grain. The provincial government has also dispatched four cadres to the Chabei Special Zone on the 24th of last month to inspect the resettlement of migrants and help solve the difficulties in spring ploughing.

    【本报讯】据察哈尔日报消息：本年京、津两市向察省移民，于三月三十日开始，四月二十一日结束，共移来三千八百二十八名。由京、津两市人民政府给足路费，并亲派干部、医生搭火车送至察省，由察北、大同移民招待站分别招待食宿。并按移民自愿，分别安置于察北、雁北各县，由政府负责送到安置地点。现在移民已平安到达各安置村。
    省府为确实做好移民安置工作，迅速转入春耕，打下长期安家的基础，特指示各县要给移民解决春耕中的具体困难，并规定出具体办法。察北专署已发下生产贷粮十三万四千多斤。省府并抽出四名干部，于上月二十四日到察北专区检查安置移民情况，帮助解决春耕中的困难。
