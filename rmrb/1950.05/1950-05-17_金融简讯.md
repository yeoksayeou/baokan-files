　　Due to lack of leadership, lack of focus, and unclear specific division of labor in March, the Xixiaochang Office of the Shanxi Branch of the People's Bank of China failed to complete all its tasks. In April, in addition to overcoming the above shortcomings, it also greatly improved its business methods, resulting in a month-end balance of 296 million yuan and an average balance of 173 million yuan, exceeding the original target by 7.2%. Furthermore, from May onwards, the office has implemented a quota and quantitative system in its work, which will encourage and stimulate the enthusiasm of staff and ensure the completion of tasks.
