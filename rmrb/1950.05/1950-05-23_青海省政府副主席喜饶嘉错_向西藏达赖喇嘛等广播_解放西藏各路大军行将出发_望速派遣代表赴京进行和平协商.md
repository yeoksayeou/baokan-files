　　Qinghai Provincial Government Vice Chairman Xirao Jiacuo
    Broadcasts to the Dalai Lama of Tibet and Others
    The Armies Liberating Tibet Are About to Depart
    Urgently Hoping to Send Representatives to Beijing for Peaceful Negotiations
    [Xinhua News Agency, 22nd] Xirao Jiacuo, Vice Chairman of the Qinghai Provincial People's Government, addressed the Dalai Lama and fellow Tibetan compatriots in Lhasa on the 9th of this month via the Xi'an People's Broadcasting Station. The speech is as follows:
    To the Dalai Lama of Lhasa, the Regent, and all monastic and secular compatriots: At the beginning of this year, I made a sincere broadcast to the front and rear Tibet from the Xining Broadcasting Station. After careful consideration, I would like to offer another piece of advice to all compatriots. Tibet is an integral part of the territory of the People's Republic of China, and the People's Liberation Army has the task and strength to liberate the entire national territory. The liberation of front and rear Tibet is inevitable. Compatriots: Do not listen to the slander spread by the British and American imperialist aggressive groups, who believe that Tibet is far from Xikang, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, with snow-capped mountains, stone mountains, and uninhabited grasslands in between, sufficient to prevent the People's Liberation Army from advancing. Recall that in 1935, the Red Army passed through Hunan, Sichuan, and Xikang from Jiangxi, traversed countless snow-capped mountains and grasslands to northern Shaanxi, and created the unprecedented and world-renowned miracle of the 25,000-Li Long March. Now, the People's Liberation Army is a hundred times stronger than it was then, and has already unified the vast majority of the country. It is naturally even less of a problem to advance into Tibet. Recently, Hainan Island, which the Kuomintang stubbornly defended in every possible way, was crossed by the People's Liberation Army over a hundred miles of sea surface, landed in front of the enemy, and the entire island was liberated in less than half a month. The liberation of Taiwan is also inevitable. The vast ocean cannot stop the advance of the People's Liberation Army, let alone Tibet being on the mainland? Compatriots: Do not fantasize about relying on American and British imperialism. The Kuomintang's millions of land, sea, and air forces, coupled with massive American aid, have also been defeated. Such fantasies are harmful and useless. Now, the Central People's Government led by the Communist Party absolutely cherishes minority nationalities and respects freedom of religious belief. The four articles of the ethnic policy in the Common Program, especially the fourth article, are a powerful guarantee for the freedom of all ethnic groups and all religious beliefs under the law. Buddhism and monasteries in Qinghai, Xikang, and other provinces that have already been liberated are being respected and protected. After the liberation of Tibet, the government will definitely implement regional autonomy under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program. Religion, military administration, and economy can all be appropriately resolved according to the actual situation. Compatriots: The armies liberating Tibet are about to depart from all directions. The arrow is on the string, and the timing is urgent. Only by uprising can there be a way out. I hope that my Tibetan compatriots will quickly rise up, strive for peaceful liberation, and quickly send plenipotentiary representatives to Beijing for peaceful negotiations, so that the Tibetan people can avoid unnecessary losses and achieve liberation through peaceful means. This is not only the happiness of the people of front and rear Tibet and Buddhism, but also unanimously welcomed by the people of all ethnic groups throughout the country.

　　青海省政府副主席喜饶嘉错
    向西藏达赖喇嘛等广播 
    解放西藏各路大军行将出发
    望速派遣代表赴京进行和平协商
    【新华社二十二日讯】青海省人民政府副主席喜饶嘉错本月九日在西安人民广播电台向西藏达赖喇嘛等及藏族同胞讲话，讲词如下：
    拉萨达赖喇嘛暨摄政和僧俗各界同胞们：今年初我在西宁广播电台向前后藏作了一次忠诚的广播词，经过详细考虑，再向各界同胞进一忠告。西藏是中华人民共和国领土之一部分，人民解放军有解放全国领土的任务和力量，前后藏的解放是有其必然性的。同胞们：慎勿听信英、美帝国主义侵略集团挑拨离间的谰言，认为西藏距离西康、青海、新疆遥远，中有雪山、石山和荒无人迹的草原，足以阻止解放军前进。回忆一九三五年红军由江西经湖南、四川、西康，历无数雪山草原直至陕北，创造了史无前例、举世闻名的二万五千里长征的奇迹；现在人民解放军力量大过当时百倍，已经统一全国绝大部分，进军西藏自然更无问题。最近国民党百计困守的海南岛，已由解放军渡过一百余里海面，在敌前登陆，不到半个月全岛就解放了。台湾的解放也是必然的。汪洋大海还不能阻止解放军的前进，何况西藏是在大陆上呢？同胞们：不要幻想依靠美英帝国主义，国民党几百万海陆空军加上大量美援也被打垮了，这种幻想是有害无益的。现在共产党领导的中央人民政府，绝对爱护少数民族，尊重宗教信仰自由。共同纲领中民族政策的四项条文，尤其是第四项条文，就是各民族各宗教信仰自由在法律上有力的保障。已经获得解放的青海、西康等省佛教和寺院都受着尊重与保护。西藏解放以后，政府一定照共同纲领的规定，在中央人民政府统一领导之下，实行区域自治，宗教、军政、经济都可根据实际情况得到适当的解决。同胞们：解放西藏的大军从各路行将出发，箭已在弦，时机迫切，只有起义，才有生路。望我西藏同胞快快起来，努力争取和平解放，迅速派遣全权代表赴京进行和平协商，使西藏人民避免不必要的损失，经由和平途径达到解放。这不单是前后藏人民和佛教的幸福，全国各族人民也是一致欢迎的。
