　　The US Actively Resurrects the Japanese Navy
    MacArthur Arbitrarily Allows Japan to Expand its Patrol Fleet
    Japan Recruits 2,000 Sailors to Serve on US-“Gifted” Warships
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 2nd (TASS): The news that the US government handed over twenty-seven small warships, which the Soviet Union returned to the US government in 1949, to the Japanese authorities, has caused consternation among US naval authorities. US naval authorities have clumsily attempted to deny this news, but these "denials" precisely confirm that these twenty-seven small warships are being used as the core of the recovering Japanese navy. For example, it can be seen from the statement issued by Vice Admiral Yoe, Commander of the US Far East Naval Forces: these ships are in fact moored at the Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan, crewed by Japanese sailors, and commanded by Japanese naval officers. In order to cover up these clues in various ways, the US occupation authorities even distorted the story, saying that the reason for transferring this batch of small warships to the Japanese was to allow the Japanese to "brush these ships," and that the Japanese were instructed to only take care of the machinery. This explanation of Japanese sailors on small warships and the ships being commanded by senior officers and Rear Admiral Keizo Yamamura (transliteration) is obviously absurd and ridiculous. It is enough for us to recall the following fact: according to the statement issued when these twenty-seven small warships were returned, the machinery, preparations, and supplies on the ships were complete when the US naval authorities accepted these ships. These small warships were handed over in such a fully orderly manner.
    There are also reports in the newspapers about other measures taken by the US authorities to restore the Japanese Navy. For example, it is reported that MacArthur allowed the number of patrol fleet ships to be increased ninefold in the autumn, and currently, Mitsubishi Dockyard is rapidly repairing eighty-six warships of various classes and displacements.
    These facts irrefutably prove that the US military authorities are restoring the Japanese Navy, thereby facilitating the revival of Japanese militarism.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 2nd (Dentsu): The Japanese government has begun recruiting 2,000 sailors to serve on the twenty-seven US warships recently given to Japan by the United States. Those who have served in the Japanese fleet will enjoy priority. These 2,000 sailors will form the core of the new Japanese navy fostered by the United States, which is part of the new Japanese armed forces established by MacArthur's staff.
    According to Dentsu Washington, 230 former senior Japanese officers have been sent to US military schools.

　　美帝积极恢复日本海军
    麦克阿瑟擅许日扩充巡逻舰队
    日募水兵二千至美帝“所赠”军舰服务
    【新华社四日讯】塔斯社上海二日讯：美国政府把苏联在一九四九年归还美国政府的二十七艘小型军舰交与日本当局的消息，已在美国海军当局中引起惶惑。美国海军当局曾经笨拙地企图否认这项消息，可是，这些“否认”恰恰证实了这二十七艘小型军舰，被用作正在恢复中的日本海军的核心的消息。例如，从美国远东海军总司令约埃中将所发表的声明中就可以看出来：这些舰只事实上正停泊在日本横须贺海军基地，船员是日本人，并有日本海军将领指挥。美国占领当局为了用种种方法瞒住这些蛛丝马迹，竟然歪曲说：该批小型军舰所以移交与日本人，是为了什么让日本人“刷洗这批舰只”，并说什么训令日本人只能照料机器。这种对日本船员在小型军舰上，及船只由高级军官与海军少将山村敬造（译音）指挥的解释，显然是荒谬可笑的。我们只要追述下面一件事实就够了：根据在归还这二十七艘小型军舰时所发表的声明，在美国海军当局接受这些船只时，船上的机器、准备与供应品俱全。这些小型军舰是在这样的充分有秩序之下交还的。
    报纸上还有有关美国当局采取另外的措施来恢复日本海军的消息。例如，据报道，麦克阿瑟在秋季曾允许把巡逻舰队的船只数目增加九倍，而在目前，三菱船坞正在迅速地修理八十六艘各种等级与排水量的军舰。
    这些事实无可置辩地证明：美国军事当局正在恢复日本海军，从而便利日本军国主义的复活。
    【新华社四日讯】据电通社东京二日讯，日本政府已开始招募二千名水手，到美国最近给予日本的二十七艘美国军舰上服役。凡曾在日本舰队中服务过的可享优先权。这二千名水手将构成美国扶植下的新日本海军的核心，这些海军是麦克阿瑟参谋部所建立的新的日本武装力量的一部分。
    另据电通社华盛顿消息：前日本高级军官二百三十名，已被送至美国军事学校。
