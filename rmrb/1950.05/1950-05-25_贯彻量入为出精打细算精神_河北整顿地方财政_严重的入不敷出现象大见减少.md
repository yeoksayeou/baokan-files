　　Implementing the Spirit of Living Within Means and Practicing Strict Economy
    Hebei Rectifies Local Finances
    The Serious Phenomenon of Expenditure Exceeding Income Greatly Reduced
    [Our correspondent from Baoding] Hebei Province is vigorously rectifying local finances based on the principle of living within means and practicing strict economy. In the past, among the province's 122 counties and 48,825 villages, 36,931 villages had implemented unified management of village finances by the county, while 7,894 villages still handled their own income and expenditure. In areas where unified management has been implemented, necessary management systems and procedures have been initially established, basically eliminating corruption and waste. In villages where unified management has not been implemented, serious problems such as arbitrary collection, arbitrary apportionment, arbitrary expenditure, corruption, waste, and theft are prevalent. According to statistics from nine cases in seven counties, including Ninghe and Luanxian, of unauthorized use and embezzlement of land grain, the amount reached more than 563,000 jin. Some lower-level financial cadres have the idea that "land grain is omnipotent," and use land grain for items that cannot be covered by state grain, increasing the burden on the masses. In the management of local finances, various counties generally lack the spirit of living within means and practicing strict economy, and neglect the increase of income, resulting in a serious phenomenon of expenditure exceeding income in some areas. For example, Tianjin Prefecture suffered relatively heavy disasters last year. The total land grain income in the autumn harvest was only 13.43 million jin, while the estimated expenditure for the entire region in 1950 was 36.5 million jin, resulting in a deficit of 23.07 million jin. Later, after study and self-criticism, various departments tried their best to reduce expenditures. At the same time, the financial departments vigorously rectified income, and as a result, they reduced 9.4 million jin from the reserve fund, river works fund, and other operating expenses alone. Income was increased through clearing settlements, clearing arrears of public grain and land tail grain, and clearing grain stored during the enemy and puppet regime period (newly liberated areas). Clearing grain from the enemy and puppet regime period alone increased income by 1.9 million jin. In total, the region's land grain increased from the original income of 13.43 million jin to 16.68 million jin. After four revisions of the original budget, the final expenditure was reduced by 17.03 million jin of rice compared to the initial budget, reducing the deficit from the original 23.07 million jin to 2.79 million jin. In Cangxian Prefecture, among the nine counties and two towns, there were three heavily affected disaster counties. When the 1950 budget was first prepared, the entire region needed 2.4 million jin in subsidies from the higher authorities. After everyone worked together to practice strict economy, not only was a balance of income and expenditure achieved, but a surplus of 66,998 jin was generated. Similarly, the budgets of various counties in Shijiazhuang Prefecture initially had deficits. For example, the estimated income and expenditure deficits of Jianping, Jingxing, Zanhuang, and Pingshan counties reached 2.358 million jin of rice. After careful consideration and review item by item, the total expenditure in the region's local financial income and expenditure budget was reduced by 3.4 million jin of rice.

　　贯彻量入为出精打细算精神
    河北整顿地方财政
    严重的入不敷出现象大见减少
    【本报保定讯】河北省地方财政，本量入为出精打细算原则正大力进行整顿。过去全省一二二个县，四八、八二五个村中。已有三六、九三一个村实行了村财政由县统筹管理，尚有七、八九四个村庄仍为村筹村支。在已实行了统筹管理的地方初步树立了必要的管理制度和手续，基本上杜绝了贪污浪费现象。在未实行统筹管理的村庄，则严重地存在着乱征、乱派、乱支、贪污浪费、失盗等问题。据宁河、滦县等七个县九起擅自动用、贪污地粮事件统计，即达五十六万三千余斤。下级一些财政干部有“地粮万能”思想，国粮不能开支项目，则动用地粮，加重群众负担。各县对地方财政管理中，普遍缺乏量入为出、精打细算的精神，和忽视增加收入的偏向，致使某些地区造成了严重的入不敷出的现象。如天津专区去年受灾较重，秋征中全部地粮收入仅为一、三四三万斤，全区一九五○年概算开支却为三、六五○万斤，赤字达二、三○七万斤。后经过学习、检讨，各部门始竭力减缩开支，同时财政部门并大力整顿收入，结果仅从预备费、河工费及其他事业费三项，即缩减了九四○万斤。通过清算结存、清理公粮地尾欠、清理敌伪时期存粮（新区）等办法增加收入。仅清理敌伪时期粮食即增加一九○万斤。共计全区地粮由原来收入的一、三四三万斤，增加到一、六六八万斤。经过四次修正原概算，最后比最初减少支出折米一、七○三万斤。使赤字由原来二、三○七万斤，减至二七九万斤。沧县专区九县、二镇中有三个重灾县，在第一次编造一九五○年概算时，全区需要上级调剂补助二四○万斤，经过上下一齐精打细算，不但做到收支平衡，反而节余了六六、九九八斤。同样，石家庄专区各县概算开始时亦均有亏额，如建屏、井陉、赞皇、平山四县收支概算亏空折米达二百三十五万八千斤。经重新逐项斟酌、审查，结果全区地方财政收支概算减支折米三四○万斤。
