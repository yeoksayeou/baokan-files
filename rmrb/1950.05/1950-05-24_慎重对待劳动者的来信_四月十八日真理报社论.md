　　Treat Laborers' Letters with Caution
    -- "Pravda" Editorial, April 18th --
    The strength of socialist democracy lies in the fact that it is a true people's democracy, attracting vast numbers of working masses to participate in current political life and manage the great cause of the country. The Soviet regime enjoys unlimited trust and active support among our people. There are countless ties between the Soviets and their executive organs and the laborers. Soviet workers, peasants, and intellectuals are deeply concerned about all activities of the Soviet regime. Millions of Soviet people directly participate in the management of the country.
    The letters, petitions, and suggestions from laborers sent to various Soviet, economic organs, and social organizations are one manifestation of the laborers' concern for improving our communist construction work.
    The large number of appeals from laborers to Soviet organs and social organizations confirms the continuous increase in the political activism of the Soviet people. This fact reflects the profound trust of the working masses in the Soviet regime of their motherland. Patriotic concern for the interests of the state inspires Soviet people to pick up their pens and state their ideas and suggestions on improving the work in this or that part of our construction, or on eliminating shortcomings that have been discovered.
    Soviet people who make suggestions and requests to our organs and organizations are masters of the country who participate in the management of the regime. Therefore, the timely, correct, and careful study of laborers' letters, petitions, and complaints is the task of all our organs and social organizations. Any Soviet organ, any leader of an organization should always remember that his responsibility is to serve the people, work faithfully for the people, and answer the laborers' questions in a timely and correct manner.
    Where the leaders and staff of organs and organizations do this, treating laborers' letters with caution becomes a habit in their work.
    However, in some departments, in executive committees, in provincial labor representative meetings, and in some economic organs and social organizations, one can encounter bureaucratic and procrastinating facts in the study of laborers' letters and requests. Some leaders completely entrust the work of handling letters to third-rate staff, who often mechanically send the laborers' letters and requests to other subordinate organizations and figures. Therefore, it is not surprising that the letters sometimes fall into the hands of the accused.
    We also have facts here where organs and organizations, instead of answering the questions raised in the letters and petitions themselves, send the authors bureaucratic - corrupt, long-prepared notices, saying that the complaint has been forwarded somewhere, or give answers with no meaningful instructions, refusing to satisfy their wishes. All this causes the inevitable dissatisfaction of the laborers and makes them have to raise the same questions to other organizations again.
    Similar attitudes of leaders of organs and organizations towards laborers' letters bring about inexcusable delays, unique to the Soviet law violators and bureaucratic elements who deserve to be dismissed.
    Not long ago, the Ministry of Health of the Russian Socialist Republic discovered many serious shortcomings in the practical work of studying laborers' complaints and petitions. Here, things even reached the point where Comrade Petrlichenko, the director of one of the general administrations, dismissed the author of a petition criticizing the shortcomings of the general administration's system.
    A letter from Kuibyshev City said that the provincial Soviet Executive Committee bureaucratically treated the letters and suggestions of collective farm members. Here, visitors waited for hours to be received, and often did not get to see anyone and went back empty-handed. In another provincial city, Smolensk, Comrade Drozdov, chairman of the city Soviet Executive Committee, "suggested" to a group of citizens who wrote to him that they no longer make demands regarding life problems to him.
    The formal - bureaucratic attitude towards laborers' letters is also manifested in some trade union organizations. Comrade Sokolova, a member of the State-Owned Trade and Public Food Trade Union, filed a complaint with the Moscow Provincial Trade Union Committee about the waste of the cafeteria manager. The Provincial Trade Union Committee replied: "The facts alleged in the complaint have not been substantiated." Dissatisfied with the bureaucratic answer, Comrade Sokolova asked other organizations to help her clarify the matter. The research conducted by the Central Committee of the Trade Union fully confirmed the facts described in the letter.
    The serious shortcomings and bureaucratic distortions in the work of studying complaints and petitions show that individual Soviet and economic workers have forgotten the instructions of the Party and the government regarding the attitude that must be paid attention to laborers' letters and questions.
    It is necessary to thoroughly end the formal - bureaucratic attitude towards laborers' letters and complaints. It is wrong to put aside and not answer any letter or petition. It must be made so that all leaders of organs and organizations take the lead in carefully treating laborers' letters and demand that their subordinates take the same attitude. Letters and petitions must be directly studied by the leaders of the organs and organizations and their deputies, who should personally make the necessary instructions on how to deal with each complaint and answer all the questions raised by the laborers in a timely manner. It is necessary to end the bureaucratic practice of delaying answers to letters and not send applications to the organizations of the leaders complained of by the laborers.
    The task of local Party and Soviet organs is to take thorough measures to improve the work of treating laborers' letters, and incorrect attitudes towards the demands and questions of the Soviet people should be punished.
    In improving the work of laborers' letters, our press can and should give great help. The experience of the correct organization of handling letters should be systematically explained in the newspapers, and bureaucrats who indifferently treat laborers' suggestions and appeals should be ruthlessly exposed. Newspaper editorial departments should show a model of the Bolshevik's careful attitude towards letters and publish more of them in the newspapers. The appearance of letters in the press is a factor in strengthening criticism and self-criticism.
    Laborers' letters help to carry out Bolshevik criticism and self-criticism, help to fight stagnation, conservatism, and bureaucracy, exercise the initiative and independent work of the masses, and warn about facts of violating Soviet law.
    Doing a good job of handling letters can help improve the level of work of state organ cadres and consolidate their ties with the masses. Timely support for the laborers' critical suggestions is a timely help to our Party, Soviet economic organs in the victorious solution of the tasks of economic and cultural construction, and in the elimination of shortcomings and errors in work.
    Laborers' letters and petitions are a manifestation of the political activism of the masses, their concern for further improving the work of all our organs and organizations, and for consolidating the power of our socialist motherland. The Bolshevik Party, Comrade Stalin, taught our cadres to carefully and attentively listen to the voices of the masses. To carefully treat laborers' letters and petitions is the glorious responsibility of every leader, every Party member, and Soviet economic worker.

　　慎重对待劳动者的来信
    ——四月十八日真理报社论——
    社会主义民主的力量就在于它是真正的人民民主，吸引广大的劳动群众参加当前的政治生活，管理国家的伟大事业。苏维埃政权在我们的人民中享有无限的信用和积极的支持。苏维埃及其执行机关和劳动者之间有着千丝万缕的联系。苏维埃工人、农民、知识分子切身地关怀着苏维埃政权的一切活动。成百万的苏维埃人民直接地参加了国家的管理。
    寄给各个苏维埃的、经济的机关和各种社会团体的劳动者的来信、声请书和建议，是改善我们共产主义建设工作的劳动者的关怀的表现之一。
    劳动者向苏维埃机关和社会团体的大量的诉愿证实了苏维埃人民政治积极性的不断的增高。这一事实反应了劳动群众对自己的祖国的苏维埃政权的极深的信任。对国家利益的爱国主义的关怀鼓舞苏维埃人民提起笔来，陈述他在我们建设中的这个或那个部分的工作的改善或关于消灭已被发现了的缺点的思想和建议。
    向我们的机关团体提出建议和要求的苏维埃人就是参加管理政权的国家的主人。因此及时的、正确的、慎重的研究劳动者的来信、声请书、控诉就是我们一切机关和社会团体的任务。任何一个苏维埃机关，任何一个团体的领导者应当经常记得，他的责任就是服务于人民，忠诚地为人民工作，及时地和正确地回答劳动者的质问。
    在那里机关团体的领导者和工作人员是这样作，那里慎重地对待劳动者来信就成为工作中的作风。
    然而在某些部里，在执行委员会里，在省的劳动者代表会议里，在某些经济机关和社会团体里，都可以碰到对于研究劳动者的来信和要求的官僚主义的和拖延的事实。某些领导者把处理来信的工作完全委托给第三等工作人员，而后者经常是机械地把劳动者的来信和要求寄给所属的其他团体和人物。因此，来信有时候落到了被控诉者的手里，一点也不奇怪。
    我们这里也有这样的事实，机关团体代替答复来信和声请书所提出的问题的本身，却寄给作者以官僚主义的——腐朽的、老早准备好了的通知，说该项控诉已经转送某处，或者给以没有有意思的指示的回答，拒绝满足其愿望。所有这些都引起了劳动者的必然的不满，并且使得他们不得不把同样的问题再一次地向其他的团体提出来。
    机关团体领导者方面的类似的对待劳动者来信的态度，带来不可饶恕的，为苏维埃法律的破坏者和理当撤职的官僚主义者手中所独有的拖延。
    不久以前，俄罗斯社会主义共和国保健部在研究劳动者的控诉和声请书的实际工作中，曾经发现过许多严重的缺点。在这里，事情甚至到了这步田地，总管理处之一的主任彼特立钦科同志把批评总管理处制度的缺点的声请书的作者撤了职。
    从古比雪夫城寄来的信说，该省苏维埃执行委员会官僚主义地对待集体农庄庄员们的来信和建议。在这里，访问者一连几个钟头地等待着接见，并且经常等不到，白跑一趟就回去了。在另一个省城斯摩林斯克，市苏维埃执行委员会主席德洛兹多夫同志向该市一群给他写信的市民们“建议”再也不要向他提出生活问题的要求了。
    形式——官僚主义地对待劳动者来信的态度在某些职工会组织里也表现出来了。国营贸易和公共食品职工会的会员索科洛娃同志向莫斯科省职工会委员会提出对食堂经理浪费现象的控诉。省职工委员会批答说：“控诉书所指事实查无实据”。对官僚主义的回答表示不满的索科洛娃同志要求其他团体帮助她把事情弄清楚。职工会中央委员会所进行的研究完全证实了信中所叙述的事实。
    在研究控诉和声请书工作中的严重的缺点和官僚主义的曲解，说明个别苏维埃的和经济的工作者忘记了党和政府关于必须注意对待劳动者来信和质问的态度的指示。
    必须彻底结束形式——官僚主义的对待劳动者的来信和控诉的态度。搁置不看和不答复任何一封信和声请书都是不对的。必须使得各机关团体的全部领导者以身作则地慎重地对待劳动者的来信，并要求自己的部属也采取同样的态度。来信和声请书必须由各机关团体的领导者及其副职直接加以研究，他们应当亲自作出对每一控诉书所采办法的必要的指示，并及时答复劳动者所提出的一切的问题。应当结束拖延回答来信的官僚主义作风，不要再把申请书寄给劳动者所控诉的领导者的团体了。
    地方党和苏维埃机关的任务就是采取彻底的办法以改善对待劳动者来信的工作，对待苏维埃人民的要求和质问的不正确的态度应当受到处罚。
    在改善劳动者来信的工作中，我们的报刊能够而且应当给予重大的帮助。在报纸上应当有系统地阐明处理来信工作的正确的组织的经验，无情的揭发冷淡地对待劳动者的建议和呼吁的官僚主义者。报纸编辑部应当表现为布尔什维克式的慎重对待来信的态度的模范，在报纸上更多地加以发表。来信在报刊上的出现——就是加强批评和自我批评的因素。
    劳动者的来信帮助开展布尔什维克的批评和自我批评，帮助与停滞不前、墨守成规、官僚主义的斗争，锻炼群众的主动性和独立工作性，警告关于破坏苏维埃法律的事实。
    作好处理来信的工作可以帮助提高国家机关干部的工作的水平，巩固他们与群众的联系。及时地支持劳动者的批评性的建议，就是在胜利地解决经济和文化建设的任务中，在消灭工作的缺点和错误中，对我们的党、苏维埃经济机关的及时的帮助。
    劳动者的来信和声请书就是群众的政治积极性的表现，他们对更进一步地改善我们一切机关和团体的工作，对巩固我们社会主义祖国的威力的关怀。布尔什维克党，斯大林同志教导我们的干部慎重地并注意地倾听群众的呼声。慎重地对待劳动者的来信和声请书，是每一个领导者，每一个党员，苏维埃的、经济的工作者的光荣责任。
