　　Xinhua News Agency, Dinghai, 21st: Revolutionary order is being rapidly established in Dinghai. The song "The East is Red" can be heard everywhere in the city, and all the people of the city are jubilant about the arrival of the People's Liberation Army. Public security in the city is extremely good. On the 17th, the day Dinghai was liberated, the electric light plant resumed power generation. Three middle schools and some primary schools also resumed classes immediately. On the 18th, businesses resumed operations one after another. Traffic between Dinghai and Shenjiamen and other places was restored on the 19th, and mail delivery was also restored at the same time. After reading the "Eight Articles of Agreement" proclamation of the People's Liberation Army, the citizens of Dinghai have, in recent days, been actively reporting Kuomintang secret agents hiding in the city. At a forum held by the PLA troops stationed in the city and the teachers and students of Dinghai County Simple Normal School, the teachers and students of the entire school collectively denounced the various crimes of the Chiang bandits in occupying the island for the past year, enslaving and oppressing the people, and burning, killing, and conscripting soldiers before fleeing. The commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army and the teachers and students of the school all excitedly shouted in unison: "Fight to Taiwan and liberate all of China!"
