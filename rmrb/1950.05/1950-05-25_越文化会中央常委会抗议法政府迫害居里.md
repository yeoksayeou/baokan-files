　　Xinhua News Agency, dated 24th: The China Peace Committee received a telegram from the Central Standing Committee of the Vietnam Cultural Association to the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, protesting the French government's dismissal of Joliot-Curie. The full text is as follows:

　　Vietnamese education, science, and art circles are extremely indignant upon learning of Professor Joliot-Curie's expulsion from the Atomic Energy Commission by the French government. Vietnamese cultural circles recognize that the masterminds behind this matter are those who are spreading death and destruction on Vietnamese soil with American weapons and French lives. Such anti-democratic actions prove that the French government is vying to serve the challenges and conspiracies of international reactionaries, just as the French government has extended the unjust war in Vietnam in accordance with the orders of international reactionaries. To achieve this goal, the French government has disregarded the rights of the French people and scientists. This action will not prevent them from increasingly heading down a path of desperation. Please convey to Professor Joliot-Curie the admiration of the Vietnamese cultural circles who are fighting for the country's independence and world peace.

　　越文化会中央常委会
    抗议法政府迫害居里
    【新华社二十四日讯】中国保卫世界和平大会委员会接到越南文化会中央常务委员会致世界拥护和平大会常设委员会抗议法国政府罢免居里电文一件，全文如下：
    越南教育、科学、文艺界人士得悉居里教授被法政府驱出原子能委员会的消息后，感到异常愤怒。越南文化界认清该事主谋者是那些正在以美国武器及法国人命在越南国土上散播死亡及破坏的人们。此等反民主之行动，证明法政府已争着为国际反动派之挑战阴谋而服务，像法政府已遵照国际反动派的命令延长在越南之非正义战争一样。为了达到此一目的，法政府已不顾法国人民及科学人士之权利。此行动并不能阻止其日益走向绝望的道路。敬请贵会代转我们正在为国家的独立及世界的和平而战斗的越南文化界向居里教授所表示之爱慕。
