　　Four Suggestions for Enhancing Movie Effects
    Attention Movie Theaters and Audiences!
    To the Editor:
    Movies are a powerful tool for propaganda and educating the masses, especially in large cities. Therefore, strengthening the management of movies (including reviewing content, checking post-screening effects, collecting audience feedback, etc.) is necessary. Currently, I feel that there are several common shortcomings in the screening of movies in Beijing that urgently need to be corrected by both audiences and movie theaters:

    1.  Develop a habit of not smoking in public entertainment venues (especially movie theaters). Firstly, many public entertainment venues in Beijing do not have ventilation equipment, so the smoke cannot escape, which is bad for the air in the venue. Secondly, too much smoke will affect the audience's vision, making the light on the screen blurry.

    2.  Do not eat sunflower seeds or talk to each other after the movie starts in public entertainment venues, so as not to hinder the clarity of the sound from the screen.

    3.  Do not applaud and cheer casually while watching a movie.

    4.  Movie theaters should enforce assigned seating. I suggest that the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture urge Beijing movie theaters to implement this, and educate private movie theaters to seek convenience for the audience, and not be solely for the purpose of making profits. For example, some movie theaters continue to sell tickets even when they have sold enough, even though it is a continuous showing, which forces the audience to stand for half an hour or an hour. Some movie theaters do not repair broken chair seats, so the audience has to sit on the chair frame, obstructing the audience behind them. For example, when the Central Cinema was showing the first show on the afternoon of April 30th, they were repairing the roof, and the clanging sound was so loud that even the sound from the movie could not be heard clearly, which distracted the audience from the film.

　　加强电影效果的四项建议
    电影院和观众注意！编辑同志：
    电影是宣传和教育群众的有力工具之一，特别是在大城市中，因而加强对电影的管理（包括审查内容，放映后效果的检查，收集观众的反映等）就成为必要。目前在京市放映电影中，我感到有几项较普遍的缺点，极需观众与电影院注意改正：
    １、在公共娱乐场所（特别是电影院）要养成不抽烟的习惯。一来京市公共娱乐场所，很多没有通风设备，烟出不去，对场内空气不好；二来烟多了，会影响观众视线，使得银幕上光线模糊。
    ２、在公共娱乐场所，不要吃瓜子，不要在开映后还互相谈话，以免妨碍银幕发音的清晰。
    ３、看电影时不要随便鼓掌叫好。
    ４、电影院要对号入座。建议文化部电影局，督促京市电影院执行，并教育私营电影院为观众求便利，不要单纯以营利为目的。如有的电影院，卖票已足额，还卖票，虽然是循环放映，就要使观众站半个、一个钟点，有的电影院椅子面坏了，不去修理，观众就坐在椅子架上，妨碍后面的观众。又如中央电影院在四月三十日下午第一场上演时，修理房顶，敲得叮咚响，连电影里的发音都听不清楚，这就分散了观众对影片的注意。
