Comrades,

The basic principle of the People's Government's labor policy is the one proposed by Chairman Mao: "Develop production, prosper the economy, take into account both public and private interests, and benefit both labor and capital." This is the basic principle of the New Democratic economic policy, and also the basic principle of the New Democratic labor policy. This basic principle has two aspects: On the one hand, "public and private interests, and benefit both labor and capital" are achieved by "developing production and prospering the economy"; on the other hand, "developing production and prospering the economy" are achieved by "public and private interests, and benefit both labor and capital." Now I will talk about the meaning of these two aspects.

(I)

According to the first aspect of the explanation, the greatest interests of the working class and the people of the whole country at present are "developing production and prospering the economy." Under the New Democratic regime, the status of the working class has fundamentally changed. In the past, workers were slaves oppressed and exploited by imperialism, feudal forces, bureaucratic capital, and even the general bourgeoisie. The lives of the workers were very miserable. After liberation, the working class became the leading class of the state power, and the workers are no longer oppressed. In state-owned and public enterprises, the workers have become the masters, and the wealth created by their labor belongs to all the people, that is, to the working class itself, and the workers are no longer exploited. In private enterprises, part of the wealth created by the workers is transformed into the profits of the capitalists, and not all of it belongs to the people, so the workers are still exploited, but this exploitation is already restricted. The workers already have their own organization - the trade union - to protect their interests; at the same time, the government is the people's government, which protects the workers, and has promulgated and will continue to promulgate various laws to protect the workers, fundamentally ensuring that workers will not be excessively exploited.

Precisely because the working class was in a position of being oppressed and exploited in the past, the more they worked, the poorer they became, and there was no possibility of fundamentally improving the living conditions of the workers. Now that the revolution has been victorious, overthrowing the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic bourgeoisie who oppressed and exploited the workers, it has created conditions for the laborers - to create their own happiness through their own labor. The more society develops, the more people's lives will improve. The only fundamental way for the working class to improve their lives is to work hard and develop production. Because after the working class stands in the position of the master of the country, they cannot, like the reactionary ruling class in the past, not engage in labor and specialize in exploiting workers and peasants for enjoyment. If the working class increases the burden on the peasants and exploits the peasants in order to improve their own lives, it will be opposed by the peasants, break the worker-peasant alliance, and shake the foundation of the New Democratic regime. On the contrary, if the working class wants to improve their own lives, they must make the lives of the peasants and all the people better, which shows that the interests of the working class are completely consistent with the interests of all the people, and must be completely consistent. This is also the reason why the working class can become the leading class in building a new society.

After liberation, the working class's attitude towards labor immediately changed, especially in state-owned and public enterprises, where workers consciously worked hard to produce. This is not accidental. After the workers' political and social status changed, their ideology also changed accordingly, and they began to understand that the working class must take full responsibility for doing a good job in production in public enterprises. In private enterprises, workers must also care about production and take half or even more than half of the responsibility. There is a dispute about the latter issue: some people think that there are capitalists and bosses in private enterprises, and there is no need for workers to care about production. Others believe that since workers are exploited in private enterprises, the more workers produce, the more they are exploited by the capitalists; why should workers work hard for the capitalists? These views are incorrect, or not entirely correct. Because at present, generally speaking, the biggest problem in China is insufficient production. The increase in production of private factories first increases the wealth of the country and the wealth of the people, and then creates profits for the capitalists. For example, producing a package of yarn is first for the people to use, which is beneficial to the people, and then we can talk about how much money the capitalists can make. And workers can use the method of signing collective contracts to achieve mutual benefit for labor and capital, at least to achieve "one inch of production growth, one point of welfare growth." Therefore, the working class in private enterprises should also care about production and improve production; only when production is improved, can the lives of the workers be improved. Only by "developing production and prospering the economy" can we achieve the goal of "public and private interests, and benefit both labor and capital." Otherwise, production will shrink, and the lives of workers cannot be improved.

(II)

The other meaning of the People's Government's labor policy is to use the method of "public and private interests, and benefit both labor and capital" to achieve the goal of "developing production and prospering the economy." On the surface, this seems very simple. In public enterprises, we should take care of the interests of the "public", that is, the interests of the state, and also take care of the interests of the "private", that is, the interests of individual employees; (Public and private interests also have a major meaning, that is, the state must take care of the interests of public enterprises and also take care of the interests of private enterprises. This is not within the scope of my report, so I will not discuss it.) In private enterprises, we should take care of the interests of both workers and capitalists. Only in this way can the enthusiasm of workers for production be improved. However, comrades! It is not a simple matter to implement the principle of "public and private interests, and benefit both labor and capital". This is a major change in the economic system, a revolution.

In the past, the only idea held by the bureaucratic capital of the Kuomintang's "public" enterprises, and even the capitalists of private enterprises, was how to make more money, how to make workers do more work, and how to pay less wages, and there would never be a concept of "taking into account both" or "benefiting both." As a result, only the "officials" had "benefits" and the "capitalists" had "benefits", and the workers had no "benefits." Under the rule of imperialism and bureaucratic bourgeoisie, the entire economic system was like this: the most important things for them to open factories were machines, houses, and raw materials. In the minds of the bosses, workers were not a problem. Because imperialism destroyed China's old production organization and created a large reserve army of unemployed people; they were only afraid that there would be no capital to open factories, and not afraid that there would be no workers to sell their labor; in the eyes of the capitalists, the most valuable thing was machines, not people, and people were appendages of machines. When a worker died, at most two hundred catties of millet would be spent to buy a coffin, and even the worker's wife and children would have to kneel down and kowtow to the boss to beg for it. But if an electric roller broke down, it would cost thousands of catties of millet; and it might not even be available for a while. If a worker died today, they could hire another one tomorrow. The entire production system and production organization of the old society were built on the basis of "machines are valuable, people are not valuable." The pain of the workers' lives and the need for cultural entertainment were not considered at all. If a worker became ill or disabled, they would be fired. Wages were very low, and working hours were very long, up to sixteen hours. When a capitalist wanted to open a factory employing a thousand workers, would they think of building accommodation for a thousand people, a cafeteria for a thousand people, and a club for a thousand people? Absolutely not. What they thought of was how to build factory buildings, how to buy machines, and how to protect machines; machines needed oiling and wiping, but the workers didn't even have a place to wash their hands. Oil was expensive, so the oil cans were very elaborate to prevent oil leakage; the kettle for the workers to drink boiled water had no lid, and the boiled water they drank was scooped out of the steam boiler; they didn't care if the workers got sick from drinking it. Taking the toilet problem as an example: you can see whether or not people are valued by the quality of the toilets. If you raise an ox or a horse at home, you still have to keep the cattle pen and stable clean; the factory's toilets are particularly dirty, and in winter they are below freezing point, and the workers will catch a cold as soon as they go in, which simply treats the workers as "worse than cattle and horses." As for the factory safety equipment problem, generally no attention is paid to it. Next to an engine or electric roller, if a female worker's hair is caught in the belt, she will die; isn't it possible to put up a wooden fence? But after calculating, enclosing each machine would cost thousands of catties of millet, and it would only cost a thousand catties of millet to have five people die!

Factory safety equipment is a serious problem. Taking the situation of coal mines as an example, it is simply appalling! During the Japanese occupation, the Fushun coal mine once killed more than 3,000 workers in an explosion! The Hegang coal mine has several "ten thousand people pits", where workers were killed by the Japanese and the foremen and then thrown there. The reactionaries did not pay attention to such problems, and now that we stand on the position of "people", we feel it is serious and hateful. The current situation is certainly very different from the past, but it is still very serious. According to simple statistics, from January to May last year in the Northeast, an average of 0.29 people died for every 10,000 tons of coal produced (i.e. one person died for every 30,000 tons of coal), and 14 people were injured; from January to August in North China, an average of 0.49 people died for every 10,000 tons of coal produced (i.e. one person died for every 20,000 tons of coal), and 25 people were injured; in East China, an average of three people died for every 10,000 tons of coal produced. This is the serious phenomenon caused by the lack of safety equipment, and it is also the evil consequence left over from the old society's system of "valuing machines and not valuing people".

There are even more cruel things, such as the problem of child labor and female labor. China has child laborers who are six or seven years old, and children who are eight or nine years old work in silk factories and yarn factories until ten or twelve o'clock. Female workers and pregnant women are the same, and it is common for female workers to have miscarriages next to the machines. Why use child labor? Because child labor wages are lower and cheaper. Some people say, "Employing child labor is based on humanitarianism to prevent them from starving." From the perspective of the entire social problem, this statement is unreasonable. Is child labor unemployment more serious, or is adult worker unemployment more serious? The problem of child labor and female labor is related to the descendants of the Chinese people, and this situation must be improved.

Therefore, our current primary task is to protect labor. If we do not take measures to protect labor, we cannot achieve "taking into account both" and "benefiting both." Article 32 of the Common Program adopted by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference stipulates very clearly:

"In state-operated enterprises, the system of workers participating in production management shall be implemented in the current period, that is, the factory management committee shall be established under the leadership of the factory director. In privately operated enterprises, in order to realize the principle of mutual benefit for labor and capital, the trade union shall represent the workers and staff to sign collective contracts with the capitalists. Public and private enterprises should generally implement a working system of eight to ten hours at present, and special circumstances may be handled as appropriate. The People's Government shall stipulate minimum wages according to the conditions of various places and industries, and gradually implement a labor insurance system. Protect the special interests of young workers and female workers, and implement a labor and mining inspection system to improve the safety and hygiene facilities of factories and mines."

Why should such articles protecting the interests of workers be stipulated in the Common Program? Because after liberation, the political and social status of the workers has changed, but the conditions in which they are in production are still temporarily unfavorable. The things left over from the past system of valuing machines and not valuing people cannot be changed well in a short period of time. Not to mention private enterprises, even in public factories, even if the factory directors are 100% good, care about the pain of the workers, and are willing to implement "taking into account both", it is still not possible to fully "take into account both" today. Because what they have taken over are the factories of bureaucratic capital, and the safety, hygiene, cultural and entertainment facilities are not yet available, or are very simple, so it is impossible to "take into account both"; therefore, for a considerable period of time, workers will be in an unfavorable position in production.

Therefore, today we must pay attention to protecting the interests of laborers, and to do this, we must first change the view of valuing machines and despising people. We must learn to value people, and understand that people are the most valuable capital, that people make machines, not machines make people. For thousands of years, the old society has looked down on people and laborers. Now we understand that the world is created by laborers. But to truly change the unfavorable conditions in which laborers are in production still takes a considerable amount of time. This cannot be determined by subjective wishes, but is restricted by objective conditions. For example, it is still difficult to implement the eight-hour working system across the board today. For another example, if we want to prohibit the employment of child labor under the age of sixteen, if we want to dismiss all the child laborers who are already working, it will cause these child laborers to suffer the pain of being unable to live. Labor insurance can only be gradually implemented; cultural entertainment can only be done slowly, from small to large. That is to say, it will take a considerable period of time to fundamentally change the unfavorable position of workers in production. However, the People's Government is determined to resolutely implement the policy of protecting labor in the Common Program, and to find ways to ensure that the conditions of laborers in production are gradually improved in the process of production development. This is also the reason why the People's Government wants to establish the Ministry of Labor.

(III)

What are the tasks of the Ministry of Labor?

(1) The primary task is labor legislation, that is, to formulate various laws to protect labor, such as: the Trade Union Law, the Wage Law, the Labor Insurance Regulations, the Factory and Mine Safety and Hygiene Regulations, etc. The promulgation of these laws is not only needed by the broad masses of workers, but also needed by the administrative aspects of public enterprises and the progressive capitalists of private enterprises. In particular, in order to encourage the enthusiasm of laborers for labor and promote the development of production, it is even more necessary to promulgate such laws.

(2) After the labor laws are in place, in order to prevent these laws from becoming empty talk on paper, the labor authorities of the People's Government must ensure that these laws are implemented uniformly in both public and private enterprises. Therefore, the Ministry of Labor has the responsibility to supervise the relevant authorities and all public and private enterprises to implement these laws.

(3) The third task of the Ministry of Labor is to adjust public-private relations and labor-capital relations. Because hired laborers are still in an unfavorable position in production, whether in public or private enterprises, workers will naturally make certain demands to improve their material lives, and disputes may arise as a result. In public enterprises, there are no class contradictions, but there are still contradictions between the part and the whole, and between public and private interests. Some people deny this contradiction and believe that since the factory director is the representative of the state, his orders are laws, and no one can oppose them; this is wrong. If you want the factory director's orders to be unopposed, you must implement the method of "from the masses, to the masses". When issuing orders, you must consult with the masses in advance and obtain the consent of the masses, so as not to arouse the opposition of the masses. To implement democratic management in public enterprises is the same principle. Therefore, to adjust public-private relations, the first thing to correct is the bureaucracy of the administrative aspects of public enterprises, and the misinterpretation and disregard of labor policies and labor laws; but at the same time, we must also correct the tendency of workers to only take care of local interests and ignore overall interests. In adjusting labor-capital relations in private enterprises, the first thing is to protect the interests of laborers and limit the excessive exploitation of capitalists; but at the same time, we must also correct the tendency of workers to only take care of partial interests and make excessively high demands that exceed the actual possibilities. Because these excessive demands are actually unfavorable to the workers. Only in this way can it be beneficial to the development of production, beneficial to all the people, and beneficial to the working class.

At present, the labor-capital relations of private enterprises are basically or will soon be on track under the adjustment of the Labor Bureau; but many administrative heads of public enterprises do not seem to have thought that the Labor Bureau has the right to interfere when they violate labor policies and laws. On this issue, their thinking has not yet been cleared. You must know that since there is a problem of public-private relations, the Labor Bureau of the People's Government has the responsibility to adjust it. In the Soviet Union, when a dispute arises between workers and enterprise administration, the administrative organs and trade union representatives first form a mediation committee to mediate. If mediation fails, workers can immediately go to court to sue. Some of our enterprise administrative heads may not have even thought that if they do something wrong, there will be workers who will sue them in court. In the future, the local Labor Bureaus must take on the responsibility of adjusting public-private relations and protecting the interests of workers in public factories.

Of course, the Labor Bureau's adjustment of labor-capital relations in private enterprises cannot fundamentally eliminate the contradictions between labor and capital; as long as private capital exists, there will be contradictions between labor and capital. The Labor Bureau's methods of mediation, arbitration, etc. only stabilize the contradictions between labor and capital to a certain extent, put labor-capital relations on the right track, and ensure the normal progress of production. Only when we enter socialism will there be no contradictions between labor and capital. However, the realization of socialism is not a short-term matter. Due to China's economic backwardness today, it must go through a considerable period of New Democratic construction. Therefore, the Ministry of Labor's adjustment of labor-capital relations is also a task for a considerable period of time.

In the past few months, mediating labor-capital disputes has almost become the only task of the local Labor Bureaus. To reduce mediation work and put labor-capital relations into a normal state, it is only possible after universally signing collective contracts and establishing labor-capital consultation meetings, so that labor-capital relations become a democratic, equal, and mutually beneficial contractual relationship. If this new labor-capital relationship is not done well, it will be difficult to do a good job in production in private enterprises.

In addition, the Ministry of Labor and local Labor Bureaus also have the tasks of allocating labor, providing relief and resettlement for unemployed workers, and planning to train skilled workers.

In summary, the basic task of the Ministry of Labor is to protect labor, gradually change the material and unfavorable position of laborers in production, implement the policy of "taking into account both public and private interests" and "benefiting both labor and capital", in order to achieve the goals of "developing production" and "prospering the economy". Labor, which was despised in the past, has now begun to be respected and has begun to become a glorious thing, but it has not yet become a truly pleasant thing. If we want to make labor a truly happy thing, we must fundamentally improve labor conditions so that everyone feels that labor is not hard, but very relaxed and happy, like doing gymnastics. This requires the long-term efforts and long-term construction of all laborers to make the country highly industrialized. This is also our overall goal. As long as the people of the whole country unite and move forward in the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, we will definitely be able to achieve this goal.

　　劳动政策与劳动部的任务
    一九五零年三月八日在第一次全国劳动局长会议上的报告
    李立三各位同志：
    人民政府劳动政策的基本原则就是毛主席所提出的：“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”。这是新民主主义经济政策的基本原则，也是新民主主义劳动政策的基本原则。这个基本原则有两方面的意义：一方面，是由“发展生产、繁荣经济”来达到“公私兼顾、劳资两利”的目的；另一方面，是用“公私兼顾、劳资两利”来达到“发展生产、繁荣经济”的目的。我现在来讲一讲这两方面的意义。
    （一）
    根据第一方面的解释说，目前工人阶级与全国人民的最大利益，就是“发展生产、繁荣经济”。在新民主主义政权下，工人阶级的地位根本改变了。过去，工人是帝国主义，封建势力，官僚资本以至于一般资产阶级压迫剥削下的奴隶。工人的生活是非常悲惨的。解放以后，工人阶级成为国家政权的领导阶级，工人是不再受压迫了。在国营、公营企业中，工人成了主人翁，用自己劳动所创造出来的财富是属于全体人民的，亦即属于工人阶级自己的，工人是不再受剥削了。在私营企业中，工人所创造出来的财富，有一部分变成为资本家的利润，而不是全部归人民，因而工人还是被剥削的，但这种剥削已经是受到限制的。工人已经有了自己的组织——工会来保护自己的利益；同时政府是人民的政府，是保护工人的，已颁布并且还要颁布各种保护工人的法令，在根本上决不会让工人受到过份的剥削的。
    正由于工人阶级在过去是处在被压迫被剥削的地位，愈劳动愈贫穷，工人生活状况是没有根本改善的可能的。现在革命胜利，推翻了压迫剥削工人的帝国主义、封建势力、官僚资产阶级的反动统治以后，就给劳动者创造了条件——能用自己的劳动来创造自己的幸福。社会生产愈向前发展，人民生活就会愈加改善。工人阶级要改善生活，唯一的根本道路是努力劳动，发展生产。因为工人阶级站上了国家主人翁的地位以后，不能像过去反动的统治阶级一样，不从事劳动，专门剥削工人农民来享福。假如工人阶级为着搞好自己的生活而来加重农民负担，剥削农民，那就会遭到农民的反对，使工农联盟破裂，使新民主主义政权的基础动摇。相反的，工人阶级要使自己的生活搞好，一定要使农民和全体人民的生活都好起来，这就说明工人阶级的利益与全体人民的利益是完全一致的，也必须是完全一致的。这也就是工人阶级为什么能成为建设新社会的领导阶级的道理。
    解放后，工人阶级的劳动态度立刻改变，特别是在国营、公营企业中，工人都自觉地努力生产。这不是偶然的。工人的政治社会地位改变后，他们的思想意识也就随着转变起来，他们开始懂得：工人阶级在公营企业中要负起搞好生产的全部责任。在私营企业里，工人也要关心生产，负一半甚至一半以上的责任。关于后面这个问题是有争论的：有人认为在私营企业中有资本家、有老板，用不着工人关心生产。也有人认为：在私营企业中，工人既然是受剥削的，工人生产得愈多，被资本家剥削的也愈多；工人何必替资本家努力呢？这些观点都是不对的，或是不完全对的。因为在目前，一般说来，中国最大的问题是生产不足。私营工厂生产的增加，首先是增加国家的财富，人民的财富，然后才是替资本家创造利润。例如：生产了一包纱，首先是给人民用的，对人民有利的，其次才能说到资本家能赚多少钱。并且工人可以用订立集体合同的办法来达到劳资两利，至少可以做到“生产长一寸，福利长一分”。所以工人阶级在私营企业中也应该关心生产，改进生产；只有生产愈改进，工人生活才有可能愈加改好。只有“发展生产、繁荣经济”，才能达到“公私兼顾、劳资两利”的目的。否则，生产萎缩，工人生活是无法改善的。
    （二）
    人民政府劳动政策的另一方面的意义就是要用“公私兼顾、劳资两利”的方法，来达到“发展生产、繁荣经济”的目的。这从表面上看，好像很简单。在公营企业中，应照顾“公”的利益，即国家的利益，也应照顾“私”的利益，即职工个人的利益；（公私兼顾还有一个主要的意义，就是国家既要照顾公营企业的利益，又要照顾私营企业的利益。这不在我这个报告的范围以内，所以不谈了。）在私营企业中，应同时照顾工人的利益和资本家的利益。只有这样，才能使工人生产积极性提高。但是，同志们！要实行“公私兼顾、劳资两利”这个原则，不是很简单的事情。这是经济制度上的大变革，是一个革命。
    过去国民党“公营”企业的官僚资本，以至私营企业的资本家所抱的唯一的念头，就是怎样能多赚钱，就是怎样能使工人多做工，又能少出工钱，决不会有“兼顾”，也不会有“两利”的观念，结果只是“官”有“利”，“资本家”有“利”，工人是没有“利”的。在帝国主义和官僚资产阶级统治下，整个经济制度就是这样：他们开工厂最重要的是机器、房屋、原料，在老板脑子里，工人是不成问题的。因为帝国主义破坏了中国旧的生产组织，造成了广大的失业后备军；只怕没有资本开工厂，不怕没有工人出卖劳力；在资本家看来，最宝贵的是机器而不是人，人是机器的附属品。一个工人死了，顶多花上二百斤小米买口棺材，甚至还要工人的老婆孩子向老板下跪磕头求情，才能得到。但是坏了一个电滚子，就要花几千斤小米；甚至一时还买不着。工人今天死了，明天就可雇到。旧社会整个生产制度，整个生产组织，都是建筑在“机器值钱，人不值钱”这样一个基础上的。对于工人生活的痛苦，文化娱乐的需要，是根本不考虑的。工人遇有疾病残废，开除了事。工资很低，工作时间很长，有作到十六小时的。当资本家想开设雇用一千工人的工厂时，会想到要建造一千人的住所，一千人的食堂，一千人的俱乐部吗？决不会的。他们所想到的只是如何建筑厂房，如何购买机器，如何保护机器；机器要加油，要试擦，工人连洗手的地方都没有。油贵，油壶就很考究使它不漏油；给工人用的开水桶却是没有盖子的，而且喝的开水是从汽锅里舀出的；工人吃了生病是不管的。再拿厕所问题来说：从厕所的好坏，就可看出重视不重视人的问题。家里养头牛和马，牛栏马厩还要弄得干干净净；工厂的厕所搞得特别的肮脏，冬天冷到冰点以下，工人一进去，就要受寒，这简直把工人当成“牛马不如”。至于工厂安全设备问题，一般都毫不注意，在一个发动机或电滚子旁边，女工的头发一卷到皮带上去就要死的，围一个木栅不行吗？但算盘一打，个个机器围起来，又要花几千斤小米，死五个人也只要一千斤小米哩！
    工厂安全设备是严重的问题。拿煤矿情形来说，简直骇人！日本占领时代，抚顺煤矿曾一次炸死三千多工人！鹤冈煤矿有好几个“万人坑”，都是日本人和把头害死了工人后，抛在那里的。反动派不重视这样的问题，我们现在站在“人”的立场上，就觉得严重了，觉得令人痛恨了。目前的情况，当然与过去大不相同了，但还是很严重的。根据简单的统计，去年东北一月至五月，平均每生产一万吨煤要死○·二九人（即每三万多吨煤死一人），伤十四人；华北一月至八月平均每生产一万吨煤要死○·四九人（即每两万吨煤死一人），伤二十五人；华东平均每生产一万吨煤要死三人。这就是没有安全设备所造成的严重现象，也是旧社会“重视机器，不重视人”这种制度残留下来的恶果。
    还有更残酷的事情，就是童工女工的问题。中国有六、七岁的童工，八、九岁的孩子在丝厂纱厂里同样工作到十点十二点钟。女工孕妇也一样，女工小产在机器旁边，是经常的事。为什么要用童工呢？就是因为童工的工资更低，更便宜。有人说：“雇用童工是从人道主义观点出发，免得他们挨饿。”从整个社会问题看，这话是没有道理的，是童工失业严重，还是成年工人失业严重呢？童工女工的问题是关系中国人民后代的问题，这一情况是必须加以改善的。
    所以我们当前首要的工作，就是要保护劳动，如不采取保护劳动的措施，就不能实现“兼顾”和“两利”。中国人民政治协商会议所通过的共同纲领第三十二条规定得很明白：
    “在国家经营的企业中，目前时期应实行工人参加生产管理的制度，即建立在厂长领导之下的工厂管理委员会。私人经营的企业，为实现劳资两利的原则，应由工会代表工人职员与资方订立集体合同。公私企业目前一般应实行八小时至十小时的工作制，特殊情况得斟酌办理。人民政府应按照各地各业情况规定最低工资，逐步实行劳动保险制度。保护青工女工的特殊利益，实行工矿检查制度，以改进工矿的安全和卫生设备。”
    为什么在共同纲领上要规定这样保护工人利益的条文呢？因为解放后，工人的政治、社会地位是改变了，但在生产中所处的条件暂时还是不利的。过去重视机器不重视人的制度所遗留给我们的东西，不是短期间可以改变得好的。私营企业不用说，就是在公营工厂里，就是厂长们都是百分之百好的，都关心工人的痛苦，都愿实行“公私兼顾”，今天也还没可能来完全“兼顾”。因为接收的是官僚资本的工厂，安全卫生、文化娱乐的设备都还没有，或者很简陋，也就无法“兼顾”得到；所以还有一个相当的时期，工人在生产当中要处于不利的地位。
    因此，今天要注意保护劳动者利益，而要做到这件事情，首先要大家改变重视机器轻视人的观点。要学会重视人，要懂得人是最可宝贵的资本，是人制造机器，而不是机器造人。千百年来，旧社会都是看不起人，看不起劳动者，现在我们懂得了世界是劳动者创造的。但要真正做到改变劳动者在生产中所处的不利条件，还是需要相当长的时间，这不是主观愿望所能决定，而是受着客观条件限制的。例如一律实行八小时工作制，今天还有困难。再如禁止雇用十六岁以下的童工，若要将已在工作的童工一齐解雇，就会使这些童工感受无法生活的痛苦。劳动保险，也只能逐步举办；文化娱乐，也只能从小而大，慢慢的来搞。这就是说，要经过相当长的时期才能根本改变工人在生产中所处的不利的地位。但人民政府是要坚决地贯彻执行共同纲领中保护劳动的政策的，要设法保障在生产发展的过程中，逐渐改进劳动者在生产中的条件。这也就是人民政府要设立劳动部的理由。
    （三）
    劳动部的任务是什么呢？
    （一）首要的任务是劳动立法，即制定各种保护劳动的法令，如：工会法、工资法、劳动保险条例，工矿安全卫生条例等等。这些法令的颁布，不只是广大工人群众所需要，而且也是目前公营企业行政方面及私营企业的进步资本家所需要的。特别是为了鼓励劳动者的劳动热忱以促进生产的发展，更需要颁布这样的法令。
    （二）有了劳动法令之后，要使这些法令不成为纸上空谈，人民政府的劳动主管机关就必须保证这些法令不论在公营私营企业中都一律贯彻实行，因此，劳动部就有监督有关机关及一切公营私营企业执行这些法令的责任。
    （三）劳动部的第三个任务，就是调整公私关系和劳资关系。因雇佣劳动者在生产中还处于不利地位，不论在公营或私营企业中，工人都会很自然地提出某些改善物质生活的要求，并可能因此发生争议。公营企业中，阶级的矛盾是没有了，但还有部分与整体的矛盾，还有公私之间的矛盾。有人否认这种矛盾，并认为厂长既是国家的代表，他的命令就是法令，谁也不能反对；这是不对的。如果要使厂长的命令没人反对，就必须执行“从群众中来到群众中去”的办法。要在发布命令时，事先和群众商量，取得群众的同意，才不致引起群众的反对。在公营企业中要实行管理民主化，就是这个道理。所以调整公私关系，首先要纠正的是公营企业行政方面的官僚主义，对于劳动政策和劳动法令的曲解与漠视；但同时也要纠正工人只顾局部利益而忽视整体利益的偏向。在私营企业中调整劳资关系，首先是保护劳动者的利益，限制资本家的过份剥削；但同时也要纠正工人只顾片面利益而提出超过实际可能的过高要求。因为这种过高要求，实际上是对工人不利的。只有这样，才能对发展生产有利，对全体人民有利，对工人阶级有利。
    现在私营企业的劳资关系，由劳动局来调整，基本上已经或即将走上轨道；但是有不少公营企业的行政负责人，好像还没有想到：当他们违反劳动政策和法令时，劳动局有权干涉他们。在这个问题上，他们的思想还没有打通。要知道既然有公私关系问题发生，人民政府的劳动局就有责任来调整。在苏联，当工人与企业行政发生争议时，首先由行政机关与工会代表组成调解委员会来调解，调解不成时，工人即可即到法庭去控诉。我们的有些企业行政负责人可能还想不到自己做错一件事，还会有工人向法庭控告他的事情。今后各地劳动局要负起调整公私关系，保护公营工厂工人的利益的责任。
    劳动局调整私营企业的劳资关系，当然无法根本消除劳资之间的矛盾；有私人资本存在，就有劳资之间的矛盾。劳动局的调解、仲裁等办法，只是使劳资间的矛盾在一定的程度上稳定下来，使劳资关系走入正轨，保证生产的正常进行。只有进入社会主义时才不会有劳资之间的矛盾了。但实现社会主义不是很短时期的事。由于中国今天经济的落后，须要经过相当长的新民主主义的建设时期，因此，劳动部调整劳资关系，也就是一相当长时期的任务。
    过去几个月调解劳资争议，几乎成了各地劳动局唯一的工作，要使调解的工作减少，使劳资关系走入正常状态，只有普遍订立集体合同，成立劳资协商会议，使劳资关系成为民主的、平等的、两利的契约关系之后，才有可能。这一新的劳资关系不搞好，在私营企业中是很难搞好生产的。
    此外，劳动部和各地劳动局尚有调配劳动力，救济和安置失业工人，有计划地培养技术工人等任务。
    总括起来说，劳动部的基本任务，就是保护劳动，逐渐改变劳动者在生产中所处的物质上的不利地位，贯彻“公私兼顾”“劳资两利”的政策，以达到“发展生产”“繁荣经济”的目的。劳动，过去是被贱视的，现在开始受尊敬，开始变成光荣的事情，但还没有变成真正愉快的事情。如果要把劳动变成真正快乐的事情，那就要根本改善劳动条件，使大家觉得劳动并不苦重，而是很轻松畅快，像习体操一样。这是需要全体劳动者长期的努力，长期的建设，使国家达到高度的工业化，才能做到的事情。这也就是我们的总的目标。只要全国人民团结一致，按照毛主席所指示的方向前进，是一定能够达到这样的目标的。
