　　People's Government to Loan Out 500 Waterwheels
　　[News from the Beijing Municipal News Agency] In order to assist suburban farmers in irrigating farmland, the Beijing Municipal People's Government is now lending out new-style waterwheels, and it is estimated that more than 500 waterwheels will be loaned out, which can irrigate about 10,000 mu of land.
　　Water wells, one of the important production tools in agricultural production in the suburbs of Beijing, have been liberated from the monopoly of the landlord class after the land reform, and will permanently serve the agricultural production of the vast number of farmers; at the same time, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has provided loans last year and this year to assist suburban farmers in repairing old wells and digging new wells (this year's water well loans are worth a total of 900,000 jin of millet, and are still being issued), therefore, it is necessary to loan out a large number of waterwheels to assist suburban farmers in making full use of these well facilities. This work is jointly carried out by the Municipal Government Suburban Work Committee, the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and the Water Conservancy Promotion Society of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Central People's Government. Only a quarter of the price is collected when lending, and the remaining three-quarters will be repaid in four installments from the autumn harvest of this year to the wheat harvest of the year after next (1952). The new-style waterwheels that are loaned out include "light three-wheeled" and "small four-wheeled" types, each of which can irrigate about 20 mu of land. Compared with the old-fashioned Bagua waterwheel, the price is more than half cheaper, and it is extremely convenient to use (the Bagua waterwheel requires large livestock such as horses and mules to pull it, while the two new-style waterwheels can be pulled by small donkeys), which is deeply loved by farmers in the suburbs of Beijing.

### 大力协助郊区农民开展生产  人民政府将贷出五百辆水车

　　大力协助郊区农民开展生产
　  人民政府将贷出五百辆水车
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民政府为了协助郊区农民灌溉农田，现正贷放新式水车，预计贷出的水车将有五百辆以上，约可浇地一万亩。
    京郊农业生产中重要生产工具之一的水井，经过土地改革后，已从地主阶级的垄断中解放出来，并将永远服务于广大农民的农业生产；同时京市人民政府曾于去年和今年分别贷款，协助郊区农民修补旧井和开凿新井（今年水井贷款共值小米九十万斤，现仍贷放中），因此，贷放大量水车以便协助郊区农民充分运用这些水井设备的工作就成为必要。此项工作由市府郊区工作委员会、市供销合作社和中央人民政府农业部水利推进社共同进行。贷放时仅收价款四分之一，其余四分之三自今年秋收起至后年（一九五二年）麦收止，共分四次归还。贷放的新式水车有“轻三轮”和“小四轮”两种，每辆约可浇地二十亩。与旧式八卦水车相较，价格低廉一半以上，使用时又极轻便（八卦水车需马骡等大牲畜方能拉动，两种新式水车用小毛驴都可拉动），深为京郊农民喜爱。
