　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 23rd. Due to stable prices, Tianjin's private industrial and commercial enterprises have begun to move towards normal development. According to statistics from the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau: In March, the city approved the opening of 131 industrial enterprises and 245 commercial enterprises; 11 industrial enterprises and 35 commercial enterprises changed their business; 116 industrial enterprises and 261 commercial enterprises closed down. In total, there was a net increase of 15 industrial enterprises and a net decrease of 16 commercial enterprises. In terms of business categories, in March, industrial enterprises in the electrical equipment, mineral oil refining, copper and tin, and brick and tile industries, and commercial enterprises in the import and export trade and north-south native produce trade all increased. The statistics indicate that the trend of private commercial enterprises that previously served landlords and bureaucratic capitalists, or developed blindly, transforming into industrial enterprises serving production and construction has become more obvious. Of the 39 commercial enterprises that blindly developed after the liberation of Tianjin in areas such as cotton yarn, silk, groceries, and paints, 39 transformed into industries such as wool spinning and electrical wires in March. Private industrial enterprises that engaged in blind production or produced crude products, and private commercial enterprises accustomed to speculating and profiting from rising prices, have begun to decline due to stable prices. The main reasons for the closure of 116 private industrial enterprises in March were substandard products, overproduction, and tight capital turnover, with the most closures being in the match industry, which had blindly developed after liberation. Among the private commercial enterprises that closed down in March, 26 were in the cotton yarn and silk industry, most of which were due to operating businesses that did not meet general needs and exhausting their funds.
    　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 23rd. Many private small and medium-sized factories in Tianjin are now organizing joint operations organizations involving all or part of the factories to overcome the production blindness caused by past decentralized operations and the current difficulties of lacking funds and having simple technical equipment. Currently, there are ten industries in Tianjin that are implementing joint operations, including brick and tile, carpets, tinware, dyeing, cotton, toothbrushes, weaving, printing, paper notebooks, and papermaking, involving approximately 500 factories and households. Joint operations in other industries such as construction, soda water, leather making, asbestos, sauces, knitwear, and new medicines are also being planned. The joint operation methods are as follows: 1. Jointly purchase raw materials and jointly sell finished products, standardize product specifications, produce proportionally according to market needs, and standardize wage standards, but still produce separately. Industries such as brick and tile and carpets adopt this method. 2. Production, sales, and procurement are all centrally managed. For example, the tinware industry, with a total of 137 households, has now formed four joint factories; nine printing factories have also formed a joint company. 3. Joint sales are carried out by the weaving and cigarette industries. 4. Joint procurement is the main focus, with joint sales as secondary, in the cotton and oil mill industries.
    　　Joint operations have had a very good effect on small and medium-sized factories in improving production and overcoming current temporary difficulties. For example, after the joint operation of the tinware industry, it accepted a large order for waterwheel pipes and waterwheel winnowing machines from the Central Water Conservancy Promotion Society, which was difficult to accept in the past. At the same time, due to the ease of technical exchange through joint operation, production efficiency has increased by more than double. The eleven silk and hemp dyeing industries originally burned one stove each, requiring more than one ton of coal per stove. After the joint operation, they combined to burn one stove, using only more than three tons of coal per day. Due to the increased planning in production after the joint operation, it is possible to adjust output according to market needs, and the phenomena of blind production and mutual exclusion in the past have been greatly reduced. For example, the brick and tile industry has eliminated the mutual squabbling that has always existed after the joint operation. In purchasing raw materials and selling finished products, intermediate exploitation has also been reduced. In addition, joint operation has also facilitated the government's management and support of small and medium-sized industries.

　　克服盲目性转为生产建设服务
    津私营工商业正常发展
    许多中小工厂组织联合经营
    【新华社天津二十三日电】天津市私营工商业因物价稳定，已开始走向正常发展的道路。据津市人民政府工商局统计：该市三月份批准开业的工业一百三十一户，商业二百四十五户；转业的工业十一户，商业三十五户；歇业的工业一百十六户，商业二百六十一户。以上计工业实增十五户，商业实减十六户。在业别方面，三月份工业中的电工器材、矿油炼制、铜锡和砖瓦等业，商业中的进出口业及南北土产贸易业均有增加。统计指明：过去为地主和官僚资产阶级服务的，或盲目发展起来的私营商业转化为生产建设服务的工业的趋势已更见明显起来。天津解放后盲目发展起来的花纱布、绸、杂货、油漆颜料等商业共三十九户，在三月份已转入毛纺、电线等工业。盲目生产或产品粗糙的工业以及习惯于在物价上涨中投机渔利的私营商业，已因物价稳定而开始趋于没落。三月份一百十六户私营工业歇业的主要原因是产品不合规格，生产过剩，加上资金周转不灵，其中尤以解放后盲目发展起来的火柴业歇业的为最多。三月份歇业的私营商业中有二十六户是花纱布绸业，其中大部是经营不合一般需求，资金耗尽所致。
    【新华社天津二十三日电】天津市许多私营中小工厂现正组织全业或部分工厂参加的联合经营组织，以克服过去分散经营造成的生产盲目性和目前经营中资金缺乏技术装备简陋等困难。现津市实行联营的已有砖瓦、地毯、白铁、炼染、棉花、牙刷、织布、印刷、制纸本、造纸等十个行业，约有五百余个厂户。其他营造、汽水、制革、石棉、酱料、针织、新药等业的联营也正在筹划中。联营方式有以下几种：一、联购原料，联销成品，统一产品规格，根据市场需要按比例生产，并统一工资标准，但仍分散生产。采取这种方式的有砖瓦、地毯等业。二、产销采购都集中经营。如白铁业共一百三十七户，现已组成四个联合工厂；印刷业九个厂亦组成联合公司。三、联合推销的有织布、卷烟等业。四、以联合采购为主，联合推销为次的有棉花、油坊两业。
    联营对于中小工厂改进生产克服目前暂时困难方面已发生了很好的效果。如白铁业联营后即接受了过去难于接受的中央水利推进社大批水车管及水车簸箕的定货，同时由于联营易于交流技术，生产效率较前提高了一倍多。十一家炼染绸麻业原来每家烧一个炉，每炉需用一吨多煤，联营后合烧一个炉，一天只用三吨多煤。由于联营后生产计划性加强，可以根据市场的需要调节产量，过去盲目生产和互相排挤的现象也大大减少。如砖瓦业联营后消除了历来相互间的倾轧。在购买原料和推销成品中也减少了中间剥削。此外，经过联营也便利了政府对中小工业的管理与扶助。
