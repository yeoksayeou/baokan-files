The Battle of Baishamen Island
    Chang Gong, Fang Ren

    On the night of March 31st, a heavy fog blanketed the sea. Two companies of a certain unit from the fourth batch of PLA amphibious forces, having lost their way after engaging enemy ships, mistakenly landed on a desolate Baishamen Island, a mere five li (approximately 2.5 kilometers) in circumference. The small island was only five or six li from Haikou City and served as an enemy outpost for monitoring the sea. The landing troops swiftly annihilated all the enemy guards on the island. The bandit leader Xue Yue, fearing that our army would use this as a springboard for attacking Haikou City, the capital of Hainan Island, mobilized the bulk of his forces to launch a fierce attack on our troops on the island.

    That night, countless enemy attacks failed. From the dawn of the next day, the bandit army launched a joint land, sea, and air attack on the small island. The enemy's strength increased from one regiment to three regiments, and the number of warships increased from the original three to ten, with aircraft taking turns bombing and strafing. The two companies of brave warriors, in such extremely unfavorable circumstances, maintained high morale and inflicted very serious blows on the attacking enemy.

    On April 1st, from morning till night, the enemy launched more than thirty attacks in total. But each time, they were fiercely beaten back by the warriors. During the fierce fighting, without food or water, the commanders and fighters chewed on raw rice and wild grass to satisfy their hunger and thirst. Casualties were increasing every moment, but everyone disregarded life and death. When those in front fell, those behind climbed up to fight. The lightly wounded continued to fight, and the seriously wounded did not leave their positions. As long as the warriors had a breath, they fought to the end with the enemy! Company Commander Tian Changshou had already been wounded three times but insisted on not leaving the front line. When he could no longer run to command, he crawled back and forth to command. As the battle continued into the night, casualties increased, and, most critically, ammunition was running low. After a meeting and discussion, it was decided to seize boats and break through the encirclement. Several small boats were seized from the continuous and repeated assaults, but everyone was determined to fight to the last breath, and no one wanted to leave the team alone. Finally, after repeated persuasion from Qin Daosheng, the organization section chief of the regiment's political department, and Ge Yinyuan, the deputy political instructor of the battalion, who were responsible for unified command, a wounded deputy battalion commander and some soldiers boarded the boats to break through. Before leaving, the commanders and fighters told them: "After you go back, you must report to the Party that we have not stained the glorious title of Communist Party members and People's Liberation Army soldiers, and we will resolutely fight to the end!"

    Another night passed, and April 2nd dawned. The fighting continued all day. The gunfire on the island gradually subsided only when it was dark. After two days and two nights of fierce fighting, the enemy paid the price of nearly a thousand casualties to finally storm the island. But the enemy gained nothing on the island. The guns and weapons abandoned on the island had been destroyed by the warriors. Some of the warriors on the island had already been transferred. Some, although seriously injured, had prepared a weapon each. When the enemy approached, they perished together with the enemy. The warriors shed the last drop of their blood for the cause of the people's liberation.

    The spirit of the warriors on Baisha Island, who were resolute, tenacious, and unyielding in their fighting, fully demonstrated the noble qualities of the People's Liberation Army commanders and fighters. The people of Hainan Island, who have now been liberated, will never forget the merits of the warriors.

　　白沙门小岛之战
    常工　方轫
    三月三十一日夜间海上弥漫着大雾。解放军第四批潜渡部队某部的两个连与敌舰作战后迷失方向，误在一座荒凉的方圆只五里地的白沙门小岛登陆。小岛距海口市仅五、六里，是敌人监视海面的前哨阵地。登陆我军迅速地把岛上守敌全部歼灭。匪首薛岳害怕我军以此作为进攻海南岛首府海口市的跳板，调集大部兵力向岛上我军猛烈进攻。
    当夜敌人的无数次攻击都失败了。从第二天清晨起匪军就以陆、海、空军联合向小岛进攻。敌人的兵力由一个团增加到三个团，兵舰也由原来的三艘增加到十艘，并以飞机轮番进行轰炸和扫射。两个连的勇士们在这样极端不利的情况下，始终保持高昂的士气，予进攻的敌人以极严重的打击。
    四月一日这天从早到晚，敌人一共发动了三十次以上的攻击。但每一次都被勇士们狠狠的打了回去。激战中没有饭吃和水喝，指战员们就嚼着生米和野草充饥解渴。伤亡每时都在增加，但每个人都把生死置之度外。前面的人倒下，后面的人就爬上去打。轻伤的一样参加战斗，重伤的也不离开阵地。勇士们只要有一口气，就与敌人战斗到底！连长田长寿已经三次负伤，仍坚持不下火线。当他实在不能跑着指挥时，便来回爬着指挥。战斗到深夜，伤亡越来越多，特别严重的是弹药已剩下无几了。经过开会讨论，便决定夺船突围。从连续不断的反复冲杀中，抢来了几只小船，但大伙都决心战斗到最后一息，谁也不愿单独离开队伍。最后经过负责统一指挥的团政治处组织股长秦道生和营副教导员葛尹元的再三劝导，一个负伤的副营长和一部分战士才下船突围。临行时指战员们叮嘱他们：“你们回去后一定要向党报告，我们没有沾污了共产党员和人民解放军战士的光荣称号，我们坚决战斗到最后！”
    一夜过去，四月二日又，战了一整天。直到天黑激岛上枪声逐渐停息。激战了两天两夜，敌人付出了近千伤亡的代价才冲上了岛。可是敌人在岛上一无所获。遗弃在岛上的枪枝武器已被勇士们一齐毁坏。在岛上的勇士们，有的已经转移了。有的虽然身负重伤，但每人都准备了一件武器、当敌人走到面前时，便与敌人同归于尽。勇士们为人民解放事业流尽了最后一滴血。
    白沙岛上的勇士们坚毅顽强宁死不屈的战斗精神，充分表现了人民解放军指战员的无产阶级的高贵品质。现已获得解放的海南岛人民，将永远不会忘记勇士们的功绩。
