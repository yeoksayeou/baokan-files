　　Strengthen Leadership and Support for Private Middle Schools
　  Bureau of Culture and Education Convenes Symposium with Principals, etc.
　　[Beijing News Agency] In order to strengthen leadership and support for private middle schools, the Beijing Bureau of Culture and Education will convene symposiums in batches for administrative leaders and political instructors of private middle schools. On the afternoon of the 10th, it first convened approximately 30 people, including principals, heads of teaching affairs, and political instructors from 11 schools, including Guanghua Girls' Middle School and Shengxin Girls' Middle School, for a symposium. After liberation, private middle schools in Beijing have generally seen considerable improvements, but in addition to the general existence of some practical difficulties that need to be resolved, a few schools are still doing very poorly in all aspects. Some principals do not understand the New Democratic education policy, and even forget their responsibilities. The content of this symposium mainly focuses on the existing problems of private middle schools, revolving around strengthening and improving administrative leadership (principal responsibility system), further improving the political and professional level of faculty and staff, and strengthening students' political and ideological education to improve their cultural and scientific level. It also aims to solve the difficulties encountered in implementing the 1950 work plan.

　　加强对私立中学的领导与扶助
　  文教局召集各校长等座谈
    【京市新闻处讯】京市文教局为了加强对私立中学的领导与扶助，将分批召开私立中学行政负责人和政治教员座谈会，并已于十日下午首先召集光华女中、盛新女中等十一校校长、教导主任、政治教员约三十人座谈。解放后京市私立中学一般是有相当改进的，但各校除普遍存在一些实际困难问题须待解决外，并有少数学校在各方面还作得很差，有的校长还不了解新民主主义的教育政策，甚至忘记了自己的责任，此次座谈内容主要是针对各私立中学现存问题，围绕着加强与提高行政领导（校长负责制），进一步提高教职员政治业务水平，和加强学生政治思想教育提高文化科学水平等三方面进行，并以解决在执行一九五○年的工作计划中所遭遇到的困难。
