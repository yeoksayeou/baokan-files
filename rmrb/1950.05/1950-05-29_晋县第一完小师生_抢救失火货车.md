　　Jin County First Elementary School Teachers and Students
    Rescue Burning Truck
    At 4:30 PM on April 27th, a freight train arrived at Jin County Station, fully loaded with raw cotton and a large quantity of peanuts being transported from Handan Supply and Marketing Cooperative to Tianjin. Due to carelessness on the part of the escort personnel, a cigarette butt was thrown into the cargo, and one car of peanuts caught fire. When the teachers and students of Jin County First Elementary School learned of this, they put down their books and rushed to the scene of the fire, extinguishing the fire within half an hour and rescuing half a car of peanuts. Afterwards, the Jin County Station wrote a letter to the teachers and students of the First Elementary School, expressing their gratitude for their spirit of cherishing national property.

　　晋县第一完小师生
    抢救失火货车
    四月二十七日下午四时三十分，晋县车站开到货车一列，满载皮棉和由邯郸供销社运往天津的大批花生。因押运人员不慎，将烟头抛进货物内，一车花生便烧了起来。晋县第一完小的师生们知道了，便放下书本赶到失火地点，在半小时内将火扑灭，救出了半车花生。事后晋县车站写信给第一完小师生，对他们这种爱护国家资财的精神，表示感谢。
