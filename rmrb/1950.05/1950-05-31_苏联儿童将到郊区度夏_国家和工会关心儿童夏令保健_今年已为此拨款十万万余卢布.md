Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 27th (TASS): Soviet children are about to spend their happy summer vacation in the suburbs. This summer, Young Pioneer summer camps organized by trade unions will accommodate 2.55 million schoolchildren. Parents only need to pay a quarter of the cost of food and lodging. This year, the state and trade unions have allocated over 1 billion rubles for children's summer health work, and have hired experienced doctors and teachers.

In the Soviet Union, the state has established a network of children's health and welfare organizations throughout the country. In recent years, many children's sanatorium areas have been established across the country. In the Russian Federation alone, sanatoriums can accommodate 45,000 children simultaneously. Children receive free treatment in sanatoriums.

    国家和工会关心儿童夏令保健  今年已为此拨款十万万余卢布
    【新华社二十九日讯】塔斯社莫斯科二十七日讯：苏联的儿童们就要到郊区去过他们愉快的暑假了。今年夏天，工会主办的少年先锋队夏令营中，将容纳二百五十五万学校儿童。父母们只要缴付膳宿费用的四分之一。今年国家和工会已为儿童夏令保健工作，拨款十亿多卢布，并且聘请了有经验的医师和教师。
    在苏联，国家在各地普遍设立了儿童保健福利机关网。近年来，全国各地又创设了许多儿童疗养区。仅在俄罗斯联邦境内，各地疗养院即能同时容纳四万五千名儿童。儿童在疗养院中都是免费的。
