　　Opinions on Yu Zhenjiang, Head of the Fourth District of Wuqing County, Neglecting Flood Control Errors
To the Editor:
    After reading the article "Yu Zhenjiang, Head of the Fourth District of Wuqing County, Neglects Flood Control, Causing Losses to the Masses" published in the People's Garden on May 8th, I would like to express some opinions: In Niu Town and Tonglin Village in the Fourth District (formerly the Sixth District) of Wuqing County, the floods in August last year were very serious. At that time, it was right to dig breaches to release the water. However, after the water was released, the breaches should have been blocked immediately to prevent the river water from overflowing again. Due to the leadership's lack of attention to this, a second disaster was caused, resulting in losses to the people's property. Although the breaches were later blocked, flood control was still not taken seriously. At the end of the flood season last year, the county government instructed the district to raise and thicken the blocked breaches. The district government did not comply with the instructions from higher authorities. Until this spring, the masses again requested the district government to raise and thicken the breaches, but the district head still delayed taking action. Even with the continuous spring rains, no attention was paid, resulting in an even greater disaster, causing significant losses to the masses and submerging more than thirteen hectares of wheat fields. This matter fully demonstrates the bureaucratic error of the district head, who disregarded the orders from higher authorities and the interests of the masses. I think it is too lenient that the Wuqing County government only gave the district head a criticism. I request that the Wuqing County government reconsider.

### 对武清县四区区长于振江忽视防汛错误的意见

　　对武清县四区区长于振江忽视防汛错误的意见编辑同志：
    在五月八日的人民园地上刊载“武清县四区区长于振江忽视防汛造成群众损失”一文，我看了以后要发表一点意见：武清县北四区（原六区）牛镇及桐林村，于去年八月间，遭受水灾，非常严重。当时挖掘缺口，将水放出，是很对的。但将水放出后，应立即堵塞，以防河水再由缺口外溢。由于领导干部对此没有注意，以致造成第二次的灾害，使人民财产受了损失。后虽经堵塞，但仍不注意防汛。去年汛末，县府指示该区将所堵塞的缺口加高培厚。该区政府不遵守上级指示。直至今春，又经群众向区政府要求加高培厚，该区区长仍拖延不管。及至春雨连绵，亦未注意，因此造成更大灾害，使群众遭受重大损失，淹没麦田达十三顷之多。这一事情充分表现该区区长漠视上级命令和群众利益的官僚主义错误。武清县政府对该区区长仅予批评处分，我认为太轻，请武清县政府考虑。
