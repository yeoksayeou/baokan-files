　　North China Agricultural Machinery Factory No. 1 Branch
　　Product Quality Improved and Costs Reduced
　　[This newspaper reports] The North China Agricultural Machinery Factory No. 1 Branch has achieved significant results in improving quality, reducing costs, increasing production, and improving tools since resuming work a year ago. Taking the manufacture of sprayers as an example: last September, the monthly output was 113 units, and this April it increased to 300 units (the lathe section produced 400 units, and the fitter section produced 300 units). At the end of last year, each sprayer sold for 300 jin of millet, but it has now been reduced to 210 jin of millet. The dusters made last year generally leaked powder, but the ones currently produced no longer have this problem. The main reasons for achieving the above results are:
    First, the administration resolutely relies on the workers. When encountering problems that cannot be solved, they consult with workers and technicians. They inspire the workers' enthusiasm and creativity and listen to the opinions of the masses. Any correct suggestions from the workers are implemented immediately if possible. If it cannot be done immediately, it must be explained well. Since February of this year, the monthly production plans have first been drafted by each trade union group through self-reporting, public discussion, and estimation of work, submitted to the trade union committee for discussion, and then handed over to the administrative负责人 to determine the plan accordingly. At the same time, the trade union appropriately paid attention to the improvement of workers' welfare. With the increase in production, in addition to actively providing free haircuts, bathing, and medical treatment for employees, it also promptly met the reasonable demands raised by the workers within the scope of what was possible. The two model worker awarding ceremonies held by the factory (the third is currently underway) also stimulated the workers' production enthusiasm. The workers are therefore more concerned about production.
    Second, the trade union cadres have a very clear "production first" ideology. After the trade union was reorganized in February of this year, it improved its leadership methods: First, it improved the group organization and established a meeting reporting system, stipulating that group meetings should be held once in the middle and at the end of each month, mainly to review the production situation for half a month and study improvement methods. At the end-of-month meeting, the production plan for the next month is also discussed. Secondly, the trade union convenes a joint meeting of group leaders at the end of each month to exchange production experience. The trade union used the method of self-reporting and public discussion to solve the problem of unreasonable labor organization in Dong Lianxiang's group; it promoted the special responsibility system and overcame the confusion of unclear responsibilities, so that the production of workers and friends continued to improve. In March of this year, the trade union promoted this method to the entire factory and helped each group to formulate plans, so that the average output of the entire factory in March increased by 28% compared with February, and the cost was relatively reduced.
    Third, party members have planned to unite the masses and played a certain role. In particular, the newly developed party members are all the most outstanding workers, thus inspiring the masses' motivation to improve.
    Fourth, the workers have demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and creativity. From October of last year to March of this year, a total of 41 types of tools were improved, which effectively increased production. For example, the spray air gourd bottom cover plug designed by Yan Xiangpu increased from ten per person per day to 250. Many things that were previously made by hand are now made with plugs or machines designed by workers, and the quality has been greatly improved. In addition, workers pay attention to saving materials, utilizing waste materials, and using substitutes at all times. For example, fitter Yu Xirong made 570 air pipe clips, all of which were made of waste materials. These are all important factors in doing a good job in production.

### 华北农业机械厂第一分厂  产品质量提高成本减低

　　华北农业机械厂第一分厂
　  产品质量提高成本减低
    【本报讯】华北农业机械厂第一分厂复工一年以来，在提高质量、减低成本、增加产量、改良工具等方面，获有显著成绩。以制造喷雾器为例：去年九月月产一百一十三部，今年四月增至三百部（车工部分做出了四百部，钳工部分三百部）。去年年底，每部喷雾器售价三百斤小米，现已减至二百一十斤小米。去年所做的喷粉机，一般都漏粉，现制的已无此毛病。获得上述成绩的主要原因是：
    一、行政上坚决依靠工人。遇到不能解决的问题，就和工人、技师们商量。启发工人的积极性和创造性，倾听群众的意见。凡是工人的正确建议，能办的马上就办。不能马上办的也要很好解释。自今年二月起，每月的生产计划，都是先由各工会小组自报公议估工定出草案，提交工会委员会讨论后，再交给行政负责人，据此定出计划。同时，工会适当地注意了工人福利的改进。随着生产的提高，除已主动地免费供给职工理发、洗澡、治病外，并在可能范围内，及时满足工人提出的合理要求。该厂举行的两次评模给奖（现正进行第三次），也刺激了工人的生产情绪。工人对生产因而更加关心。
    二、工会干部的“生产第一”的思想很明确。今年二月工会改选后，改进了领导方法：首先健全了小组组织，建立了会议汇报制度，规定每月月中、月底各开小组会一次，主要的是检讨半个月的生产情况；研究改进办法。在月底的会上，并讨论下月的生产计划。其次工会在每月月底，召开小组长联席会，交流生产经验。工会曾以自报公议方式，解决了董连祥小组劳动力组织不合理的毛病；推广专责制，克服了职责不清的混乱现象，使工友生产不断提高。工会在今年三月，将这个办法推广到全厂，并帮助各组订计划，使全厂三月份产量平均比二月份提高百分之二十八，相对地减低了成本。
    三、党员们有计划地团结群众，起了一定的作用。特别是新发展的党员都是最优秀的工人，因而激发了群众的上进心。
    四、工人发挥了高度的积极性和创造性，自去年十月到今年三月，改良工具共达四十一种，有效地提高了生产。如阎祥浦设计的喷雾器风葫芦底盖闷子，从一人一天做十个，提高到二百五十个。许多种以前用手工制的东西，现在都改用工人设计的闷子或机器做，质量大为提高。此外，工人还随时随地注意节省材料、利用废料和代用品。如钳工于熙容做了五百七十个风管卡子，就完全用的是废料。这些都是搞好生产的重要因素。
