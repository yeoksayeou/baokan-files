[Beijing News Agency Dispatch] Deputy Mayor Zhang Youyu of the Beijing Municipal People's Government delivered a work report on the Tax Review Committee at the municipal government's administrative meeting on the 12th. In his report, he stated: In order to better complete the task of collecting industrial and commercial taxes for the second half of 1949 in Beijing and to avoid individual industrial and commercial households bearing unfairly light or heavy burdens, the administrative meeting decided to strengthen the work of the Tax Review Committee. As of now, a total of nine business households have applied to the committee for review, and they have been appropriately resolved according to their specific circumstances. Among them, one type involves those with no accounts to check or incomplete account books, such as Liu Dayin Advertising Agency and Heji Department Store. After understanding their past business operations and comparing them with similar businesses, their burdens were not considered heavy. In addition to being notified to pay as required, they were also instructed to establish sound account books. Another type involves those with relatively sound account books, which were then audited. For example, after auditing Yizhao Department Store, it was confirmed that there was no net profit, and it was decided to only require them to pay business tax and not income tax. There were also cases where the entire industry sector needed to be readjusted or individual businesses were indeed bearing excessive burdens, such as Tongjuyi Pigment Store and Xinfeng Oil Factory. The tax bureau has been notified to readjust the industry classification or investigate the accounts based on the actual situation and then reassess the tax amount. Another type involves individual businesses whose allocated shares were slightly unfair during the group assessment, but after investigation, their own shares did not exceed the amount they should bear, such as Wanjutai Oil Mill. It was decided to notify them to pay the tax as required. As for the slightly unfair assessment, it will be appropriately adjusted during the next tax collection. In addition, there are special circumstances, such as the Swiss company Bailly Foreign Firm. The tax bureau determined that the tax share for the first half of last year was 2,000 shares after auditing the accounts. The company considered it excessive and requested a review in mid-December of last year and returned the tax bill. However, the issue was not resolved for more than two months. After investigation, the company's burden was not considered heavy, and they have been instructed to pay the tax according to the original share. As for the rice price, because the reply was not timely, the responsibility lies with the municipal government, and it was decided to calculate it at 700 yuan based on the industrial and commercial tax adjustment rice price for the first half of 1949. Deputy Mayor Zhang emphasized that the municipal government should conduct self-criticism for the delayed review. Businesses applying for review must also pay attention to the tax law: If a review is requested due to an excessively heavy burden, the tax amount determined by the tax bureau should still be paid as scheduled or an application for deferred payment should be submitted, pending the review. If the audit results confirm that it exceeds the burden, the share will be reduced. They must not return the government tax bill on their own, using the excuse that the review request has not been resolved to delay tax payment. In the report, Deputy Mayor Zhang also strictly criticized individual tax bureau cadres for failing to fully and effectively implement the method of paying in two installments during this collection work. He said: It is to be encouraged that industrial and commercial operators voluntarily pay the two installments of tax in advance in one lump sum. Those who intentionally resist taxes and fail to pay on time should be punished by the government according to the law. However, it is not allowed to use coercive measures to force a one-time payment, which violates the government's decisions and policies. The Municipal Taxation Bureau should immediately investigate the facts and give appropriate punishment.

　　市政府张友渔副市长
　　报告税收复核工作           
　　全市有九商户报请复核已分别处理
    【京市新闻处讯】京市人民政府张友渔副市长在十二日市府行政会议上作了关于税收复核委员会的工作报告。他在报告中说：为更好地完成京市一九四九年下半年度工商业税征收任务，并尽量避免发生个别工商业户负担畸轻畸重的偏向，行政会议曾决定加强税收复核委员会的工作。截至目前止，报请该会进行复核的商民共有九户，已分别按具体情况适当解决。其中，有一种是根本无帐可查，或帐簿不健全的，如刘大隐广告社及和记百货店两家，经了解其过去营业情况，并与同类商户比较，负担均不为重，除分别通知照缴外，并令建立健全帐簿。一种是有较健全帐簿的，即进行查帐，如亿兆百货店经查帐结果，确无纯益，已决定令其只缴营业税，不纳所得税。也有一种是因整个行业业分须重新调整，或个别商户确实负担过重的，如同聚义颜料庄及信丰油厂，已通知税务局根据实际情况重新调整业分或清查帐目，再行评定税额。另一种是此次评议税分在小组评议时，个别商户分配额，虽稍有不公，但经调查结果，其本身并未超过应负担额者，如万聚泰油坊，则决定通知其照缴税款。至评议稍有不公问题，则俟下次征税时适当调整。此外，还有一种特殊情况的，如瑞士商百利洋行，去年上半年工商业税税分经税局查帐结果定为二千分，该商认为过重，于去年十二月中旬请求复核，并将税票退回，但拖延二个多月没有解决，经查帐结果，该商负担并不重，已令其仍按原分缴税；至于米价方面，因为未及时批复，责任在市府，决定仍按一九四九年上半年度工商业税调整米价七百元计算。张副市长对此特别强调指出：市府未及时复核，应进行自我检讨，而申请复核的商户也必须注意税法：如因负担畸重而请求复核的，仍应先将税局所定税额如期照缴或申请缓缴，听候复核，经查帐结果确实超过负担者再行减分，不得自行将政府税票退回，借口请求复核尚未解决而拖延缴税时间。在报告中，张副市长并对个别税务分局干部在此次征收工作中未能完全切实执行分两期交款办法，作了严格批评。他说：工商业者自愿将两期税款一次提前缴纳，是应该鼓励的，有意抗税逾期未缴者，政府应依法予以处分，但如用强迫手段限令一次缴纳，则系违反政府决定与政策，是不允许的，市税务局应立即查明事实，酌予适当处分。
