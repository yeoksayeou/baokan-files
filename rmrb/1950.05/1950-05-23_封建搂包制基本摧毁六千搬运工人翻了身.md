　　The feudal "loulou" system in Beijing's transportation industry was a kind of feudal, hegemonic organization. Now, this extremely vicious organization has been basically destroyed. From now on, the transportation workers will forever get rid of feudal exploitation and oppression. They have successively established transportation teams to contract for freight transportation. This is the victorious result of the struggle against the feudal monopolistic system by the transportation workers under the leadership of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and with the support and cooperation of the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the Public Security Bureau for more than two months.

　　(1) Countless Crimes of the "Loulou"

　　The so-called "loulou" refers to the feudal bosses in cart, flatbed cart, loading and unloading, and other transportation industries, and is one of the remaining feudal forces in Beijing. In the past, they colluded with the reactionary rulers and their henchmen (some of them were the henchmen of the reactionary rulers themselves), using gangsters and thugs to occupy railway stations, city gates, and warehouses, while also dividing the main thoroughfares into areas, each dominating one side, and monopolizing freight transportation. For example, Han Qingkai, who occupied the East Railway Station of Qianmen, jointly controlled freight transportation with Liu Xiaolin, a special agent of the railway police section during the Japanese imperialist rule; Liu Deren and Jin Wenquan (also known as Jin Pangzi), who occupied the West Railway Station of Qianmen, were sworn brothers with the Kuomintang detective captain; Li Ming, who occupied the Guang'anmen Railway Station and several large warehouses nearby, recognized Inuzuka, the manager of the Japanese International Corporation (specializing in transportation business), as his adoptive father; another example is the "loulou" bosses who monopolized "Zhangyimen Road" and "Yongdingmen Road," who directly received "Imperial Certificates" from the Qing Dynasty and obtained hereditary privileges.

　　For many years, the "loulou" have relied on this feudal monopolistic privilege to carry out horrifying exploitation of workers. Generally, the exploitation suffered by workers under the oppression of the loulou accounted for at least 40% to 50% of their income, and often as much as 70% to 80%. All the workers directly ruled by the loulou could not directly contract for business themselves, but could only listen to orders and work for the loulou. All their income was plundered by the loulou, and then the loulou bosses would arbitrarily throw down a few tips, called "following the master's reward." Another type of worker not directly ruled by the loulou had to obtain the permission of the loulou to work in the areas monopolized by the loulou, and at the same time, they had to contribute a part of their income to the loulou bosses; there were also loulou who were also cart owners, in addition to asking workers for "loulou money," they also asked for high "cart rental fees," and sometimes even a "personal share fee."

　　The "loulou" not only cruelly exploited the workers economically, but also regarded the lives of the workers as worthless. They would scold workers at every turn, beat them at will, and even set up private courts, torturing workers with barbaric punishments, pouring cold water, pressing with levers, using electric shocks, piercing fingernails with bamboo sticks, burning people with red-hot iron bars, and letting loose wolves to bite people. People like Liu Deren, Jin Pangzi, Li Ming, and Yang Deshan, these extremely vicious "loulou" bosses, had all electrocuted, kicked, beaten to death, or forced workers to death. Sometimes, after killing a worker, they would force other workers to take the blame and go to jail for them; sometimes, in order to compete for hegemony, the loulou would instigate and drive workers to fight in groups, fight each other, and kill each other.

　　Since this feudal hegemonic "loulou" organization monopolized freight transportation, it charged customers exorbitant freight rates, seriously hindering the circulation of goods and harming production. According to statistics, from the railway station to transport grain to the grain depot or grain store, it had to go through four kinds of workers to load, unload, and transport, and the total freight cost was at least equivalent to 1.5% of the total grain price. In order to facilitate extortion, the "loulou" colluded with the enemy, puppets, and Kuomintang station luggage rooms or police and military police, forcing customers to hire them. Otherwise, the station staff would not process the formalities, or the puppet police and military police would create difficulties in various ways, such as detaining a full car of fresh fish and pinching open the mouths of the fresh fish one by one to check whether there were smuggled goods hidden in their bellies. At this time, the victims had to swallow their anger and take out money or listen to the extortion of the loulou.

　　(2) After Liberation, the "Loulou" Continued to Do Evil

　　After liberation, the general "loulou" still tried to maintain their feudal monopolistic privileges in various ways. Some organized pseudo-trade unions themselves, and some pretended to be progressive and mixed into the trade unions (such as Jin Pangzi, Diao Songlu, Li Ming, etc.) to carry out sabotage. Some threatened and attacked workers who joined the trade union, slandered the cadres of the trade union, and undermined the prestige of the trade union. The "loulou" bosses Han Qingkai, Feng Deshan, etc., had three times coerced workers to collectively petition the trade union to demand that the extortion of the "loulou" be recognized as legal; Ji Wenqi, Mei Yufang, etc., had smashed Luo Xingtai's shop that sold long-distance bus tickets on consignment and injured the apprentice Ma Suofa; the "loulou" holding "Imperial Certificates" on Zhangyimen Street openly beat foreign workers. As for beating, scolding, and exploiting workers, although it was not as blatant as before after liberation, it still existed universally. The "loulou" boss Li Ming once arrogantly said to the workers: "Wolves eat meat all over the world, and dogs eat shit all over the world. A head is always a head."

　　(3) Under the Suppression of the People's Government, the "Loulou" Organization Was Defeated by the Transportation Workers!

　　In order to destroy the "loulou" organization, the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions have carried out a fairly long and tortuous struggle. In the summer and autumn of last year, the Municipal Public Security Bureau successively arrested some elements who continued to do evil, but they still could not destroy their organization. Many arrested "loulou" believed that "going in is only for two or three days and then coming out, which is worth it." At that time, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions had also carried out the work of educating workers and disintegrating the "loulou" organization from within the workers, but because the masses had been oppressed for a long time and had many concerns, the problem could not be solved. It was not until February of this year that, after long-term and careful preparations by the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, the Public Security Bureau issued an order to disband the "loulou" organization, arrest key figures such as Han Qingkai and Jin Wenquan, and summon secondary figures; at the same time, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions deeply mobilized the masses and launched a struggle to accuse and report, which basically destroyed the "loulou" organization. When the key figures were first arrested and the masses had not been fully mobilized, the "loulou" were still making a desperate struggle. Some openly threatened the workers: "Whoever dares to sue me will be eradicated," and some coerced the workers to bail out the arrested "loulou" bosses. At that time, the workers had many concerns, feeling that "the evil has not been completely eliminated" and "the fierce power is still there," fearing that "a big boss like Liu Deren would play with lives once released"; they said: "Don't fail to kill the tiger and harm yourself," and some even worried that the "loulou" still had relations with the detective team of the Public Security Bureau as in the past, believing that "these people cannot be provoked." Therefore, at first, they always avoided mentioning "loulou," and when asked, they always replied: "I don't know," "Don't ask me," or said: "I haven't been 'lou'ed." After the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions held training classes for activists, cultivated backbones, mobilized workers, held an accusation meeting of more than 1,000 transportation workers at the Qianmen Railway Station, the center of loulou activities, and carried out accusation and reporting campaigns in various areas controlled by the loulou in the city in a prepared manner, the situation completely changed. The workers all accused the crimes of the "loulou" and demanded that the government and the trade union help them overthrow the "loulou." The workers in Guang'anmen heard that Qianmen had held an accusation meeting, so they automatically held a meeting to pour out their grievances, which lasted from 1:00 p.m. to late at night, exposing the extremely sinful "loulou" boss Li Ming, and wrote 34 letters of accusation. After such extensive accusations and reports by the workers, nearly 100 "loulou" scattered throughout the city were reported, and some key figures who had escaped, such as Li Ming, Liu Delu, and Wang Zhenjiang, were also arrested. Some who continued to do evil or stubbornly resisted and refused to bow their heads to the workers, such as Ma Tongfu and Zhu Jinshui, were also arrested. At this time, some small "loulou" also bowed their heads to the workers to repent, registered with the trade union, and requested the trade union to reform them. At the same time, they introduced the businesses they monopolized to the trade union or transportation teams, and honestly queued up to pull goods and work hard like the workers. The prestige of the "loulou" completely collapsed. And the workers raised their class consciousness and confidence in victory in the struggle. They said: "We are not afraid of the 'loulou'. Is the power of the 'loulou' greater than the People's Government? Is it greater than the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions?" Some workers said with smiling faces: "Now we can hold our heads high. The former 'black dregs' (that's how the 'loulou' called the workers) have now become the masters." Some workers said happily to others: "In the past, the 'loulou' were the old masters, suppressing us so we didn't dare to breathe. Now we are the grandfathers, and they have become the grandsons. This is called being overturned and liberated." They also immediately understood: "This is all the result of the Communist Party leading us and educating us. We must follow the Communist Party!"

　　(4) Organizing Transportation Teams, the Transportation Workers Completely Overturned and Liberated

　　In order to fundamentally destroy the economic foundation of the "loulou" monopolistic system and facilitate the circulation of goods, the Beijing Municipal People's Government is preparing to establish a city-wide state-owned transportation company. During the transition period before the company is established, in order to replace the "loulou" in contracting for freight transportation, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions is leading the transportation workers to organize transportation teams. After more than two months of efforts, transportation teams have now been formed for carts, flatbed carts, and loading and unloading workers in Qianmen and six districts in the city. Nearly 5,000 workers have participated, accounting for about 80% of the total number of more than 6,000 existing workers. The workers of the transportation teams have also formulated transportation covenants, not robbing or stealing, handling goods gently, and many workers carry needles and linen thread with them to sew up bags that are torn at any time; at the same time, everyone pulls carts in order of their numbers, and if one person cannot pull it, everyone helps. The phenomenon of fighting for business like in the past has been completely eliminated.

　　Due to the elimination of the exploitation of the "loulou," both freight rates have been reduced and the lives of the workers have been improved. According to the workers: "Now pulling one load a day is enough to eat, and pulling two loads a day is surplus," "Pulling one day in the past is not as good as pulling one load now." Since the flatbed cart workers at the Beihui Road entrance in the Twelfth District have organized transportation teams to pull carts in order, their daily income is more than a dozen kilograms of millet, an average increase of almost two times compared with their previous income. Moreover, the phenomenon that workers often could not earn money for one or two days in the past can no longer be found.

### 封建搂包制基本摧毁六千搬运工人翻了身

　　封建搂包制基本摧毁六千搬运工人翻了身
    北京市搬运业中的“搂包”，是一种封建把持的恶霸组织，现在这个穷凶极恶的组织已经被基本摧毁了；搬运工人从此永远摆脱封建的剥削与压迫，纷纷成立搬运小组，承揽货运。这是搬运工人在市总工会的领导与北京市人民政府及公安局的支持、配合下，两个多月来对封建把持制度进行斗争的胜利成果。
    （一）数不尽的“搂包”罪行
    所谓“搂包”，就是大车、排子车及装卸等搬运业中的封建把头，是北京市的封建残余势力之一。他们过去与反动统治者及其爪牙互相勾结（有的本身就是反动统治者的爪牙），利用流氓、打手，霸占车站、城门口和仓库，同时将通行要道也划分范围，各霸一方，垄断货运。如：霸占前门东车站的韩清凯即曾与日帝统治时期的铁路警务段特务刘小林共同把持货运；霸占前门西车站的刘德仁、金文泉（即金胖子）与国民党侦缉队长是拜把兄弟；霸占广安门车站及其附近几个大仓库的李明认日本国际公司（专营运输事业）的经理犬冢为义父；又如垄断“彰仪门道”、“永定门道”的“搂包”头子，是直接从满清领取“皇帖”而获得世袭特权的。
    若干年来，“搂包”就凭借这种封建把持的特权，对工人进行了骇人听闻的压榨。一般在搂包压迫下的工人所受的剥削，至少是占收入的四五成，多的常到七八成。凡是在搂包直接统治下的工人，自己是不能直接承揽生意的，只能听候差遣，替搂包作工，全部的收入都被搂包所掠夺，然后由搂包头子随意丢下几个赏钱，叫“随爷赏”。另一种不在搂包直接统治下的工人，要在搂包垄断的地区干活，也得经过搂包的允许，同时就得抽取收入的一部分贡献给搂包头子；还有一种搂包而兼为车主的，除开向工人要“搂包钱”之外，还要很高的“车份钱”，有时还要一份“人份钱”。
    “搂包”不仅在经济上残酷地剥削工人，而且将工人的生命视如草芥。对待工人张口就骂，举手就打，甚至私设公堂，非刑拷打工人，灌凉水、压杠子、动电刑、用竹签刺指甲、用烧红的铁通条烫人、放狼狗乱咬人。像刘德仁、金胖子、李明，杨德山等这些凶恶之极的“搂包”头子，都曾电死、踢死、打死或逼死过工人。有时打死了工人之后还逼着别的工人代他吃官司、坐监牢；有时为了争夺霸权，搂包们调唆、驱使工人群殴、互殴、自相残杀。
    这种封建恶霸的“搂包”组织，既然垄断了货运，就对客商索取高昂的运费，严重障碍货物的流通，危害生产事业。统计从火车站搬运粮食到粮栈或粮店，中间须经过四种工人来装、卸、运，全部运费至少相当于全部粮价的百分之一·五。为了便于敲诈勒索，“搂包”与敌伪、国民党的车站行李房或警察、宪兵勾结起来，迫使客商非雇用他们不可。否则站内人员就不给办手续，要不然就由伪警伪宪来多方刁难，例如把满车的鲜鱼扣留下来，把鲜鱼一条一条捏开嘴来检查鱼肚里是否藏有私货。这时候受害的客商就只好忍气吞声地拿出钱来，或听受搂包的敲诈。
    （二）解放后“搂包”仍然继续为恶
    解放后，一般“搂包”仍以各种各样的方式企图维持他们的封建把持特权。有的自己组织伪工会、有的伪装进步混入工会（如金胖子、刁松禄、李明等）来进行破坏。有的威胁与打击参加工会的工人，诽谤工会的干部，破坏工会的威信。“搂包”头子韩清凯、冯德山等曾三次胁迫工人集体向工会请愿要求承认“搂包”们的敲诈勒索是合法的；吉文启、梅玉芳等曾砸毁代卖长途汽车票的罗兴泰号，打伤该号的徒弟马所发；彰仪门大街持有“皇帖”的“搂包”竟公然殴打外来的工人。至于对工人的打骂剥削，解放之后虽不如从前的明目张胆，但仍然普遍存在。“搂包”头子李明就曾狂妄地向工人说过：“狼走遍天下吃肉，狗走遍天下吃屎，头终久是头。”
    （三）在人民政府镇压下，“搂包”组织被搬运工人打垮了！
    北京市人民政府和总工会，为了摧毁“搂包”组织，曾经进行了相当长期曲折的斗争。去年夏秋两季，市公安局曾陆续逮捕过一些继续作恶的分子，却还不能摧毁其组织，很多被捕的“搂包”认为“进去了不过是两三天就出来，这还够本。”当时市总工会也曾从工人的内部进行过教育工人与瓦解“搂包”组织的工作，但因为群众被压迫已久，顾虑极多，也不能解决问题。直到今年二月间，市公安局和市总工会经过长期周密的准备之后，一面由公安局下令解散“搂包”组织，逮捕韩清凯、金文泉等首要分子，传讯次要分子；同时由市总工会深入地发动群众，开展控诉检举的斗争，才把这个“搂包”组织基本摧毁了。在首要分子刚被逮捕，群众还没有充分发动起来的时候，“搂包”仍在作垂死挣扎，有的公开威胁工人：“谁敢告我，就铲除谁”，有的胁迫工人保释被捕的“搂包”头子。当时工人的顾虑很多，觉得“除恶未尽”、“凶威还在”，害怕“像刘德仁这样的大头子，一旦放出来，是会玩命的”；他们说：“不要打虎不成反害己”，有的甚至担心“搂包”还像过去一样与公安局侦缉队有关系，认为“这些人惹不了”。因此，最初总避免提起“搂包”，问他们的时候，总回答：“我不知道”，“你不要问我”，或者说：“我没有被搂过”。经过市总工会开办积极分子训练班，培养骨干，发动工人，在搂包活动中心的前门车站召开了一千多搬运工人的控诉大会，并且有准备地在全市各“搂包”把持地区开展控诉检举运动之后，情况就完全改变了。工人们都纷纷控诉“搂包”的罪行，要求政府和工会帮助他们打倒“搂包”。广安门的工人听到前门开了控诉会，就自动开诉苦会，从下午一时开到深夜，把罪大恶极的“搂包”头子李明检举出来，并且写了三十四封控诉信。经过工人这样广泛的控诉与检举，散在全市各处的“搂包”，被检举出近一百人，一些漏网的首要分子，如李明、刘德禄、王振江等也都给抓起来了，一些继续作恶或顽强抵抗、不肯向工人低头的，如马同福、朱金水等，也被逮捕了；到这时候，一些小“搂包”们也纷纷向工人低头悔过，到工会登记，请求工会改造他们，同时把他们垄断的买卖介绍给工会或搬运小组，自己也老老实实跟工人一样排队拉货，卖力气。“搂包”的威风全垮了。而工人却在斗争中提高了阶级觉悟和胜利信心。他们说：“不怕‘搂包’了，‘搂包’势力大，大得过人民政府吗？大得过总工会吗？”有的工人堆着笑脸说：“这下子可扬眉吐气了，从前的黑渣子（‘搂包’这样叫工人）现在变成主人了。”有的工人喜气扬扬地对人说：“过去‘搂包’是老天爷，压得咱们不敢啃气，现在咱们是爷爷了，他们变成孙子了，这就叫翻了身”。他们也立刻明白：“这都是共产党领导咱们，教育咱们的结果，咱们要跟着共产党走！”
    （四）组织搬运小组，搬运工人彻底翻了身
    为了根本摧毁“搂包”把持制度的经济基础，便利货物流通，北京市人民政府已在筹备成立全市性的公营搬运公司。在公司还没有成立的过渡期间，为了代替“搂包”来承揽货运，市总工会领导搬运工人组织搬运小组。经过两个多月的努力，现在已经在前门和市内六个区里把大车、排子车、装卸工人都组成了搬运小组，参加的工人近五千人，约占现有工人总数六千余人中的百分之八十。搬运小组的工人们并且订立了搬运公约，不抢不偷、轻拿轻放，好多工人都随身带着针和麻线，袋子一破就随时补上；同时大家按排号拉车，一人拉不动，大家就帮忙，像过去那样抢生意打架的现象根本消灭了。
    由于消灭了“搂包”的剥削，既减少了运费，又改善了工人的生活。据工人们说：“现在每天拉一趟就够吃，拉两趟就有富裕”、“从前拉一天也抵不过现在拉一趟”。在十二区北纬路车口的排子车工人，从组织搬运小组排号拉车以来，每日收入十几斤小米，平均比从前的收入几乎增加了二倍。而且从前工人们常常有一两天挣不到钱的，现在这样现象就根本找不到了。
