Deep County’s Substitute Farming Work Not Done Well
County Government Should Pay Attention to Improvement

To the Editors:

In some villages in Shen County, Hebei Province, the substitute farming work for military families is not done well. Some village cadres simply do not care about the military families. The county and district governments have not paid attention to this problem either. Take Laogaojia Village in the Eighth District of Shen County as an example. The village has more than 500 people, and male laborers (18 to 55 years old) account for about one-fifth of the total population. However, we, the families of martyrs and military personnel, only have two households. According to the substitute farming regulations stipulated by the Hebei Provincial Government, they need to substitute farm more than 20 mu of land, but this problem has not been resolved. Last year, a contract system was implemented, where substitute farmers were divided into groups, each with a group leader, and above them was a preferential treatment director. When families of martyrs and military personnel needed substitute farming, they would go to the group leader, who would assign people to do the work. However, no one was willing to do the work, not even the group leader himself. The preferential treatment director, Gao Lianyin, was even worse. Not only did he not care about the difficulties of the families of martyrs and military personnel, but he often threatened them (both families only have women, no men). Gao Lianyin himself is very lazy. He planted land last spring, but as of the first month of this year, there were still two mu of millet unharvested (his family has three people, with two male laborers). So people in the village call him Gao Lazy Silver.

This spring, the village cancelled the substitute farming group leader system and assigned the number of substitute farmers to each military family, who then had to find them directly. In this way, the cadres have reduced their troubles, but it is even more difficult for military families to find people to do the work. Until now, we still have half of our land unplanted, but other people's land is already sprouting or weeding.

Editor, if the land of military families is not planted, and there is no harvest or reduced production in the fall, what will they do for their livelihood and public grain?

Another example is Fujiazhuang in the Sixth District of Shen County. The village has more than 100 households, but only one family of martyrs, with only one woman and a baby in her arms. But the village does not help them at all (of course, we know that families cannot rely on others for everything). It was not until the government requisitioned wheat that the village cadres asked me to borrow some, but I had nowhere to borrow from, so they harvested the wheat for me. Until now, my six mu of land has not been planted.

Editor, I heard that some areas have implemented a work point system, which is a very good method. Why doesn't our county implement it? Why don't the district and village cadres take the families of martyrs, military personnel, and workers seriously? Does the county government know about these situations?

Please, Editor, forward these situations to the Shen County Government and ask them to investigate and deal with them immediately. We have also reported this issue to the Hebei Daily before, asking them to forward it to the Shen County Government. They wrote back saying that they had forwarded it, but the county government did not pay attention to these matters.

### 深县代耕工作未做好　县政府应注意改进

　　深县代耕工作未做好
　　县政府应注意改进编辑同志：
    河北省深县某些村庄对军属代耕工作做得很不好。有些村干部，根本没把军属放在心上。县、区政府对这个问题亦未引起注意。就拿深县第八区老高家庄来说吧，全庄约有五百多口人，男劳动力（十八岁到五十五岁的）约占全庄人口的五分之一。而我们烈、军属却只有两户。按河北省政府规定的代耕条例，他们需要代耕的地共二十多亩，但是这一问题一直没有解决。去年曾实行过包代制，由代耕的人分成组，每组设一组长，上面还有优属主任，烈、军属需用代耕时就去找组长，由组长分配人去做活计。可是找谁谁也不愿给做活，连组长本人也是如此。那位优属主任高连银更是糟糕，他不但不照顾烈属、军属的困难，而且时常恐吓军属（两家都只有妇女，没有男人）。高连银本身就非常懒，去年春天种的地，直到今年正月还有二亩谷子没收割呢（他家三口人，有两个男劳动力）。所以庄中人都叫他高懒银。
    今年春天该村取消了代耕小组长，给每家军属规定了代耕的人数，由军属直接去找。这样，干部们固然减少了麻烦，但是军属找人做活就更难了。直到现在，我们还有一半地没有种上，可是别人的地都在?苗或耪了。
    编辑同志，军属的地如果种不上，秋后没有收成或减产，他们的生活及公粮怎么办？
    再如深县六区傅家庄，全庄一百多户人家，只有一户烈属。只有一个妇女和一个尚在怀抱的小孩，但是庄中一点也不帮他们的忙（当然，我们知道，家属不能凡事依靠别人）。直等到政府征麦的时候，村干部叫我去借，我没处去借，他们才给我把麦子打了。直到现在，我家的六亩地还没法种上。
    编辑同志：听说有的地区已实行工票制了，这办法很好，为什么我们县不实行呢？区村干部为什么不把烈、军、工属放在眼里呢？这些情况县政府知道不？
    以上这些情形，请编辑同志转告深县政府望他们即刻调查处理。关于这个问题我们从前也曾向河北日报反映过，请他们转达深县政府，他们来信说已经转达了，但是县政府并没有注意这些事情。
