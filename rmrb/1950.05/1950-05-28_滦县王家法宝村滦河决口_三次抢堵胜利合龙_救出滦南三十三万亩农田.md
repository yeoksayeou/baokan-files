　　Luan County Wangjia Fabao Village Luan River Breach
    Three Times of Emergency Repair Successfully Closed
    Saving 330,000 Mu of Farmland in Luannan
    [This newspaper, Luan County News] The Luan River breach at Wangjia Fabao Village in Luan County, Hebei Province, has been successfully closed, saving 330,000 mu of fertile land in Luannan from flooding. The Luan River breach at Wangjia Fabao Village in the county was one of the four major breaches in Hebei Province last year. In 1939, the Japanese invaders, in order to irrigate 30,000 mu of paddy fields in Luannan County, opened a diversion canal on the west side of Wangjia Fabao Village on the right bank of the Luan River; the river water was discharged from here, which could not be stopped. Later, although a stone dam was built at the mouth of the canal to prevent the river water from flowing south, it frequently breached during the rule of the Japanese invaders and Chiang bandits due to the lack of solid engineering. Last year, due to excessive rainfall, the flood broke through the stone dam in three places again, and 330,000 mu of fertile land in Luannan became a vast expanse of water. In order to complete the breach closure project, the laborers of Luan County and Luannan County, under the leadership of the Luan River Breach Closure Project Office, launched the emergency repair work from October 16th last year, regardless of the severe cold. However, due to the great force of the water, it breached as it was being repaired. The second time was from November 5th, when emergency repairs were carried out again, but the closure still failed due to severe water leakage from the stone gaps. The third project started on March 12th this year, with leakage reduction of the stone dam and embankment construction on the right bank (the Luan River originally had no embankments) proceeding simultaneously. Because the leakage reduction of the stone dam was successful, it created favorable conditions for blocking the mouth of the diversion canal, and finally it was successfully closed at 4:00 am on April 29th. The dam will also be fully completed by the end of May. The successful completion of the breach closure project has freed 330,000 mu of fertile land in Luannan from the scourge of flooding.

　　滦县王家法宝村滦河决口
    三次抢堵胜利合龙
    救出滦南三十三万亩农田
    【本报滦县讯】河北省滦县王家法宝村滦河决口已胜利合龙，使滦南三十三万亩良田免除水患。该县王家法宝村的滦河决口，是去年河北省四大决口之一。在一九三九年，日寇为灌溉滦南县的三万亩稻田，在滦河的右岸王家法宝村西，开了一条引水渠；河水由此下泄，不能遏止。以后虽在渠口筑有石坝以防河水南泄，但在日寇和蒋匪统治时期，却因工程不坚实，而时常决口。去年由于雨水过多，洪水又将石坝冲决三处，滦南三十三万亩良田，尽成泽国。为了完成堵口工程，滦县、滦南两县民工，在滦河堵口工程处领导下，从去年十月十六日起，不顾严寒，展开了抢堵工作。但因水势浩大，边堵边决。第二次从十一月五日起，再行抢堵，因石隙漏水厉害，仍未能合龙，第三次工程于今年三月十二日开工，石坝减漏和右岸筑堤（滦河原来就没设过堤防）同时并进。因为石坝减漏的成功，就给堵塞引水渠口门造成了有利条件，终于四月二十九日上午四时胜利合龙。堤坝至五月底亦可全部完工。由于堵口工程的胜利完成，已使滦南三十三万亩良田脱离水患。（河北省水利局报导组）
