　　Beijing Immigrants Arrive in Happy Village
　　By our reporter Bai Yuan

　　April 17th was a memorable day in Happy Village. On this day, immigrants from Beijing arrived in the village. There were forty-five of them in total, including strong men and women, old men and women, and groups of children. They arrived in the village at dusk, when many villagers were out in the fields tilling the land. The People's Liberation Army stationed in the village for production had returned from work and were eating dinner. When they heard that immigrants from Beijing had arrived, they immediately dropped their bowls and chopsticks and ran out of the village to greet them. As soon as the carts carrying the immigrants entered the village, the soldiers rushed forward to help them with their luggage. Village cadres were busy finding firewood and furniture for them in the village, and helping them settle into their houses. The villagers moved out pots, bellows, basins, and bowls that they could spare, personally helping them install the bellows next to the stove and teaching the immigrants how to use them. They didn't stop until everything was settled, the lights were on, and they had eaten dinner. Village cadres, soldiers from the army, and villagers inquired about their journey and about the situation in Beijing in every immigrant's home. They spoke as if they were talking to their own relatives, telling everyone who asked about the day they boarded the train in Beijing, the day they arrived in Datong, and then how they arrived in the village. They told the people of Happy Village that the government and the people were so concerned and considerate towards everyone willing to engage in labor and production from Beijing to Happy Village. After recounting his experiences along the way, one immigrant said: "Truly, the sky has changed, and the earth has changed! I truly know this time: the government is the people's government, and the country is truly the people's own country!"

　　The day after they arrived in Happy Village, the village government, the People's Liberation Army stationed in the village for production, and the immigrants who came to the village held a get-together, which was also a welcome party for these forty-five new villagers. At the meeting, the village chairman announced that from then on, these forty-five people would become citizens of Happy Village, and like all the villagers, they would work together in production, participate in the production and construction of Happy Village and the entire country, and become united and harmonious fellow villagers for generations to come. Everyone should help each other and learn from each other, so that all the villagers could become good citizens building our new country. At the meeting, everyone gave these forty-five new villagers a detailed introduction to the local production situation and various customs. The comrades from the army performed many entertainment programs for them. A new child sang "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland," which he had learned in Beijing, moving many people.

　　Next, the cadres of Happy Village began to plan new household affairs with them. According to government regulations, each person could receive a living loan of 180 jin of millet, a livestock loan equivalent to 190 jin of millet, an agricultural tool loan of 50 jin, and a settlement allowance of 15 jin. According to the situation of these forty-five people, there were a total of nine households. If calculated at an average of five people per household, each household could receive a living loan of 900 jin of millet, a livestock loan equivalent to 950 jin of millet, an agricultural tool loan of 250 jin, and a settlement allowance of 75 jin. From now until the harvest season, in three or four months, the living loan of grain would be enough to eat. To make their lives more prosperous, the village cadres also tried to exchange some of their millet for sorghum. In terms of livestock and agricultural tools, according to the village cadres' calculations, buying a cow for every two households would be enough for plowing, in addition to buying the necessary agricultural tools, and the loan received would be sufficient. To take care of some people who had never farmed before, the village planned to organize them to exchange cattle work for the labor of the villagers to help them cultivate the land at the beginning. For individuals who had never participated in labor, had lived in the city for a long time, and did not know how to live a simple, laborious rural life, the village cadres taught them how to budget carefully, teaching them how to calculate long-term prospects from a handful of grass or a handful of rice.

　　Among these newcomers, most of them had participated in labor and were willing to work. Many of them had lived in the countryside and relied on labor for a living in the past. Due to the exploitation and destruction of landlords, bureaucrats, and imperialist forces, they lost their land and all their support, and had to wander in the cities living various precarious lives. When they arrived in the village and saw the land cultivated by the farmers, they felt extremely close to it. That day, the village cadres told them about the climate, soil quality, how deep to plow when plowing, and which piece of land was suitable for planting which crops. They also told them how far the land allocated to them was from the village and in which direction, and then took them out of the village to see the land allocated to them. A few miles out of the village, across a small river, was the fertile land that had been flooded with water diverted from the river two years ago in order to improve the soil quality and increase grain production, with four or five inches of silt accumulated on it. Everyone took off their shoes and waded across the water. Li Baoli, who used to make a living by carrying coal in Mentougou, Beijing, had farmed in the village before he went to the city. He grabbed a handful of black soil from the ground, smelled it, and then pulled up a clump of last year's stubble from the ground and said to everyone: "Look at how big the stubble is! Good land, no doubt!" The day after seeing the land, Li Baoli was so happy that he couldn't sit still. Because they had not yet bought their livestock and their land could not yet be plowed, he ran to the villagers' fields to watch them plow. A villager saw that he was from Beijing and asked him if he had ever farmed and if he knew how to farm. He said: "I'm afraid I don't, let me try." So he held the plow, drove the ox, and refused to let go, helping the villager plow the land for a whole day.

　　Now, with the help of the village cadres, they are rushing to buy cattle and agricultural tools, and will soon be able to start spring plowing. In the days before going to the fields, both men and women go to the fields every day to collect firewood, or thresh sorghum at home, to prepare for spring plowing. The children who should be in school have already started attending the village's primary school. The village government is also planning with them to discuss participating in a part of the water conservancy project with the water conservancy project office that is building water conservancy here after the spring plowing is completed, so as to increase their income with the wages earned and quickly improve their lives. In this way, after the autumn harvest, they can work completely worry-free and live a better life day by day.

　　北京移民到了快乐村
    本报记者  白原
    四月十七日，在快乐村，是一个值得记忆的日子。这一天，从北京来的移民到了村里。他们一共是四十五个人，其中有壮年的男人、女人，也有老头子、老婆婆和成群的小孩子。黄昏的时候他们到达了村庄，村里的许多人都到地里耕地去了。驻在村里进行生产的人民解放军收工回来，正在吃晚饭，听到北京来的移民到达了村庄，立即丢下碗筷跑出村外去迎接。移民乘坐的大车刚一进村，战士们就抢上前去帮他们拿行李。村干部忙着去村里给他们找柴火，找家具，帮他们安置房子。村里的老百姓把自己所能腾出来的锅、风箱、盆子和碗筷搬出来，亲自替他们把风箱安置在灶旁，并教移民们怎样使唤。一直到他们把一切都安置停当，点上灯，吃过了晚饭。村干部们，部队里的战士们和村里的老乡们，在每一个移民的家里探问着他们一路上的情形，探问着北京的情形。他们好像对着自己的亲人谈说新的家常一样，告诉每一个询问的人，他们那一天从北京上的火车，那一天到的大同，然后又怎样到了村。他们对快乐村里的人们说：从北京到快乐村，政府和人民对每一个愿意进行劳动生产的人都是这样的关心，这样的体贴。一位移民在述说了他一路上所经历的情形以后说：“真是天也变了，地也变了！我这次可真知道：政府是人民的政府，国家也真真是人民自己的国家了！”
    在他们到达快乐村以后的第二天，由村政府、驻在村里生产的人民解放军和来到这个村里的移民举行了一个联欢会，也就是为这四十五位新的村民所举行的欢迎会。在这个会上，由村主席宣布：从此这四十五个人就成为快乐村的公民，和村里所有的老百姓一样，大家一同劳动生产，参加快乐村和整个国家的生产建设，世世代代都成为这个村子的团结和睦的乡亲。大家互相帮助，互相学习，使全村老百姓都成为建设我们新国家的良好的公民。在会上，大家向这四十五位新的村民详细介绍本地生产的情况以及各种风俗习惯。部队的同志为他们表演了许多娱乐节目。还有一位新来的小孩子给大家唱他在北京所学的“兄妹开荒”，使许多人都受了感动。
    接着，快乐村的干部们就开始和他们一起来筹划新的家务了。根据政府的规定，他们每一个人可以领到生活贷粮一百八十斤小米，牲畜贷款折合小米一百九十斤，农具贷款五十斤，安家费十五斤。如果按照这四十五个人的情况，他们一共是九户。如平均以每户五口人计算，每户可领到生活贷粮九百斤小米，牲畜贷款折合小米九百五十斤，农具贷款二百五十斤，安家费七十五斤。从现在到收获的季节，三、四个月的时间，生活贷粮就足足够吃了。为了他们生活过得更加充裕，村里的干部们并设法替他们把一部分小米换成高粱。在牲畜和农具方面，根据村干部的计算，除了买必需的农具以外，两家伙买一头牛已够耕地，所领的贷款也足够了。为了照顾其中一部分没有种过地的人，村里计划在开始的时候组织他们用牛工去换村里老百姓的人工来帮助他们耕种。对于个别过去从未参加过劳动，又长久住在城市里，还不知道怎样过俭朴的劳动的乡村生活的人，村里的干部们就教他们怎样精打细算，从一把草、一把米的上面去教他们如何来计算长远光景。
    在这些新来的人们中间，大部分都是参加过劳动，并且是愿意劳动的人。其中有许多过去也就是在农村里靠劳动生活的。由于地主、官僚以及帝国主义势力的剥削和摧残，才使他们失去了土地和一切的依靠，不得不流落在城市里过着各种无依无靠的生活。他们到了村里，看见了农民们所耕种的土地，都有一种极其亲切的感情。那一天村干部们在告诉了他们这个地方的气候、土质、耕的时候需要耕多深，以及那一块地宜于种那样庄稼；并告诉他们村里准备分给他们的地离村多远，在那个方向之后，带他们一起出村去看那一片分给他们的地。出了村几里地，隔着一道小河，就是那一片因为要改良土质，增产粮食，前年才从河里引水漫过一次，上面积着四五寸淤泥的肥沃的土地。大伙一起脱鞋涉水过去。原在北京门头沟靠背煤为生的李保利，没到城市以前就在村里种过地。他从地上抓起一把黑色的泥土，用鼻子嗅了一阵，然后又从地里拔起一簇去年的谷槎对大家说：“看多大的谷槎！好地，没有错！”就在看地以后的第二天，李保利就乐得坐不住了。因为他们的牲口还没有买妥，他们的地还不能耕，他就跑到老乡们的地里去看老乡们耕地。一个老乡看见他是北京来的人，就问他种过地没有，会不会种地。他说：“怕不会，让我试试看。”于是他就扶着犁，赶着牛，一直不肯放手，整整帮着老乡耕了一天的地。
    现在，他们正在村干部的帮助下，赶紧买牛买农具，很快即可着手春耕。在没有下地的这几天，他们无论男的、女的，都每天到地里去检柴火，或者在家里推高粱，为春耕作好准备。该念书的小孩则已开始在村的小学校里上学。村政府并和他们计划，等春耕完了以后，和正在这里建设水利的水利工程处商量参加一部分水利工程；以所得的工资来增加他们的收入，以便迅速改善生活。这样，到秋收以后，他们就可以完全无忧无虑地劳动着，过着一天比一天好的生活了。
