　　Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 29th: The movement in various parts of Northeast China to aid unemployed workers in Shanghai is nearing its end, and large amounts of donations are being remitted to banks. According to statistics from the Northeast Bank: as of the 26th of this month, the total donations received amounted to 70,830,050,700+ Northeast currency (calculated at 12 Northeast currency to 1 Renminbi). Of this amount, 50 billion was remitted to Shanghai on the 20th; the remainder will be remitted in the near future.

　　Since the Shanghai General Trade Union issued an appeal to trade unions across the country in mid-April to aid unemployed workers in Shanghai, workers in the Northeast have enthusiastically launched campaigns to contribute labor and donate funds. People from all walks of life have also provided assistance in various ways: public employees and teachers donated their salaries, veterans donated their allowances, and the literary and art circles held charity performances, all of which achieved great results. In addition, the troops under the Northeast Military Region also donated more than 200,000 jin of grain saved through frugality.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 29th: Henan Province has launched work to aid unemployed workers and impoverished citizens. The Provincial People's Government has allocated 2 million jin of wheat to focus on aiding unemployed workers in major cities such as Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Xuchang, Luoyang, and Xinyang. The cities of Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, and the special districts of Xuchang, Xinyang, and Huaiyang, have respectively established committees to aid unemployed workers or committees for production to overcome famine. They have begun to implement work-for-relief programs, organize workers to engage in production for self-salvation, mobilize workers to return to their hometowns for production, and distribute relief grain. In Xuchang City and Lushan County of the Xuchang Special District, 1,137 people have voluntarily returned to their hometowns to participate in production after being mobilized. In Xiangcheng County, 756 people have participated in grain transportation work, earning 35.79 million yuan in wages, which can solve their living expenses for 21 days. In Zhoukou City of the Huaiyang Special District, more than 800 unemployed or semi-unemployed workers have participated in projects such as repairing dikes and transporting bricks. Under the leadership of the trade union and the women's federation, workers' families have also participated in production such as making hemp thread and weaving, thus basically solving their livelihood problems. In addition, in some areas with severe difficulties, emergency relief grain has been distributed. For example, 167 people in the Chengguan District of Lushan County have received emergency relief.

    河南拨麦二百万斤救济失业工人
    【新华社沈阳二十九日电】东北各地救济上海失业工人的运动已近结束，大批捐款正在向银行汇交中。据东北银行统计：至本月二十六日止，已收到的捐款共为东北币七百八十三亿零五十万七千余元（按东北币十二元折合人民币一元）。其中五百亿元已于二十日汇至上海；余额亦将于最近汇去。
    自四月中旬上海总工会向全国各工会发出救济沪失业工人的呼吁后，东北工人即踊跃展开献工、捐款运动。各界人民也以不同方式进行援助：公教人员捐出工薪，荣誉军人捐出津贴，文艺界举行义演，均有很大成绩。此外，东北军区所属部队也捐出节约所得的粮食二十余万斤。
    【新华社开封二十九日电】河南省已展开救济失业工人和贫苦市民的工作。省人民政府已拨发小麦二百万斤，有重点地救济开封、郑州、许昌、洛阳、信阳等主要城市的失业工人。开封、郑州两市和许昌、信阳、淮阳等专区，已分别成立了救济失业工人委员会或生产度荒委员会，开始进行以工代赈，组织工人生产自救，动员工人回乡生产和发放救济粮等工作。许昌专区的许昌市和鲁山县，已有一千一百三十七人经过动员后，自愿回乡参加生产。襄城县已有七百五十六人，参加运粮工作，得到了工资三千五百七十九万元，可解决二十一天的生活。淮阳专区周口市八百多个失业或半失业工人分别参加了修堤、运砖等工作。工人家属也在工会和妇联领导下，参加了打麻线、纺织等生产，因而基本上解决了生活问题。此外，有些困难严重的地区，并开始发放救济粮进行紧急救济。如鲁山县城关区有一百六十七人得到了紧急救济。
