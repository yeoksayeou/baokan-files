Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 29th - The Tianjin Supply and Marketing Cooperative's Farmers' Service Cooperative has been progressively expanding its business since February due to its efforts to improve its work. The total turnover in March reached over 3.3 billion yuan, which is 330% of February's and more than 32 times that of January. The cooperative now accommodates an average of 250-260 farmers daily, and purchases and exchanges approximately 40,000 jin of coarse grains for farmers alone each day.

After its establishment last October, the cooperative was unable to quickly resolve the issue of purchasing and selling goods on behalf of farmers due to insufficient communication with relevant departments and state-owned trading companies, which caused farmers to stay in Tianjin for too long. Until the end of January this year, it only accommodated an average of 60-70 farmers daily, and the monthly turnover was less than 100 million yuan. After February of this year, in order to overcome the above shortcomings and promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, the cooperative sent people to disaster areas such as Wen'an, Ba County, and Anci in Hebei Province after the Spring Festival to understand the farmers' production and disaster relief situation and publicize the business content of the Farmers' Service Cooperative. At the same time, it established purchasing agency relationships with the purchasing committees of cooperatives in various districts of Tianjin, cooperative stores in major factories, and specialized companies such as China Egg Products and North China Native Products. It also established sales agency relationships with the North China Grain and Oil Company, the North China Cooperative Warehouse, and the Tianjin Salt Company, so that the farmers could promptly sell the goods they brought and exchange them for the needed coarse grains, kerosene, salt, matches and other necessities. Furthermore, it greatly simplified procedures for purchasing and sales, regardless of quantity. Farmers can now return satisfied after staying in Tianjin for at most two or three days, or even on the same day, and they all find it convenient.

　　津农民服务社业务开展
    每日留宿农民二百五六十人，代农民购换粗粮四万斤。
    【新华社天津二十九日电】天津市供销合作总社所属农民服务社，由于努力改进工作，二月份以来业务日渐开展。三月份的营业总额达三十三亿余元，为二月份的百分之三百三十；超过一月份的三十二倍。现该社每日平均留宿来津农民二百五六十人；每日代农民仅购换粗粮一项即达四万斤左右。
    该社在去年十月成立以后，因为与有关部门及国营贸易公司的联系不够，致不能迅速为来津农民解决代销代购物资问题，使农民在津停留时间过久。直至本年一月底，平均每日只留宿农民六、七十人，每月营业总额尚不足一亿元。本年二月以后，该社为克服以上缺点，推进城乡物资交流，春节后曾先后派人赴河北省文安、霸县、安次等灾区了解农民生产救灾的情况，宣传农民服务社的业务内容；同时，与津市各街区合作社的采购委员会、各大工厂合作社以及中国蛋品、华北土产等专业公司建立了代购业务，与华北区粮食、油脂公司、华北合作货栈、津市盐业公司等建立了代销业务，及时代农民销出带来的物品，换回所需的粗粮、煤油、食盐、火柴等必需品；并且大大简化手续，代购代销，不拘数量。农民至多在津停留两三天或当天即可满意而归，无不称便。
