Beijing Municipal News Agency Report:

　　The Beijing Municipal Second People's Representative Conference Consultative Committee held its sixth meeting at 3:00 PM on the 20th in the conference room of the committee in Zhongshan Park. The meeting heard reports from the Sixth and Seventh Districts on the preparatory work for the People's Representative Conferences; a report from the Municipal People's Court on the work of clearing backlog cases; and discussed and approved the Municipal People's Government's proposal on inspecting cadre work style and discipline, and convening a mobilization meeting of Party, government, and mass organization cadres in Beijing. Regarding the adjustment of industry and commerce in Beijing, the meeting heard a report from the Municipal Financial and Economic Committee and decided that the Consultative Committee would establish four groups: industry and commerce, taxation, labor-capital relations and unemployment relief, and district representative conferences.

Li Rui, Song Ruifen, and Wang Feiran Report:
Preparing to Open District People's Representative Conferences and the Court's Clearance of Backlog Cases

Li Rui, Director of the Preparatory Committee for the People's Representative Conference of the Sixth District of Beijing, and Song Ruifen, Director of the Preparatory Committee for the People's Representative Conference of the Seventh District of Beijing, successively reported at the meeting on the progress of the preparatory work for the People's Representative Conferences in the Sixth and Seventh Districts. Both districts have conducted publicity in various ways, held forums to collect opinions from the people in the districts, and launched the election of representatives of mass organizations and street residents. As this work is the first of its kind in Beijing, cadres and the masses lacked experience, and therefore there were shortcomings such as insufficient publicity, undemocratic work style of individual cadres, and rigid methods, which are now being corrected.

Wang Feiran, President of the Municipal People's Court, then reported on the progress of clearing backlog cases. Since the official start of this work on the 15th of this month, the number of cases cleared each day has increased from the initial 30 to the current 80, and it is expected that 100 cases can be cleared each day next week. In the process of their work, the cadres participating in the work gradually gained experience and began to overcome tedious bureaucracy, improving work efficiency.

Vice Mayor Zhang Youyu Reports:
Inspection of Cadre Work Style and Discipline Will Begin with the Sixth and Seventh Districts as the Focus

Zhang Youyu, Deputy Mayor of the Municipal People's Government, reported that the Municipal Government is preparing to conduct a movement to inspect cadre work style and discipline. In order to make a breakthrough and gain experience, it is prepared to focus on the two districts that are about to convene district People's Representative Conferences, conduct inspections first, and then expand to the whole city after gaining experience.

After Vice Mayor Zhang's report, Peng Zhen, Chairman of the Consultative Committee, solicited the opinions of the members present. Members Xu Deheng, Fei Xiaotong, Qian Duansheng, etc., spoke successively and unanimously agreed with Vice Mayor Zhang's proposal.

During the meeting, members Xu Deheng, Liang Sicheng, Qian Duansheng, etc., raised the issue that the traffic order in Beijing is becoming chaotic again and traffic accidents are increasing, requesting the government to pay attention to this, strengthen the responsibility of traffic police, conduct publicity among citizens, and strengthen the training of traffic rules for car drivers, pedicab drivers, and rickshaw pullers. Luo Ruiqing, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, immediately expressed his acceptance of this suggestion and explained that the Municipal Public Security Bureau is studying this situation. In addition to continuing to emphasize persuasion and education, and simultaneously starting to implement necessary penalties, specific measures to reorganize the traffic order in Beijing are being formulated.

Cheng Hongyi, Deputy Director of the Municipal Financial and Economic Committee, Reports:
Issues of Industrial and Commercial Adjustment and Government Measures

Finally, Cheng Hongyi, Deputy Director of the Municipal Financial and Economic Committee, reported on the current issues of industrial and commercial adjustment in Beijing and the government's measures. After analyzing the basic situation of industry and commerce in Beijing, he said: This issue is relatively complicated. The Beijing Financial and Economic Committee has conducted preliminary research and extensively and repeatedly exchanged opinions with people in the industrial and commercial sectors. The general policy of the measures that the Municipal Government is currently preparing to take is to continue to implement the spirit of the Central People's Government to balance revenue and expenditure and stabilize prices, and to take appropriate measures to reduce the difficulties of industry and commerce that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood during the transition period. The main tasks at present are to adjust public-private relations, strengthen guidance on the direction of industry and commerce, and universally establish labor-capital consultation meetings, where labor and capital work together to actively find ways to overcome the current difficulties. At the same time, organize public and private forces, absorb idle funds, and provide loans to industry and commerce that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. In terms of taxation, fairness and rationality must be achieved, and procedures must be simplified. The Municipal Taxation Bureau has reduced or exempted the industrial and commercial tax arrears for the second half of 1949 for those who are indeed overburdened, and has approved deferred payment on a case-by-case basis for those who are temporarily experiencing difficulties in capital turnover due to slow sales of goods. In addition to the above measures, in order to concentrate forces, coordinate public and private efforts, and effectively solve the difficulties existing in industry and commerce in Beijing, the Municipal Government has transferred cadres from the Financial and Economic Committee and other financial and economic organs, and together with representatives of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, more than 60 people in total, have formed six temporary working groups, which will go separately to several industries and industrial and commercial households with more difficulties to conduct further investigation and research, mobilize the enthusiasm of both labor and capital, and assist in solving problems that can be solved at present on the basis of the efforts of the industrialists and businessmen themselves, and then universally promote them in various industries in industry and commerce throughout the city after obtaining some practical and feasible methods and experience.

After the report by Deputy Director Cheng Hongyi, Chairman Peng Zhen expressed his opinion on this issue. He said: This is the most important and central issue in Beijing at present. In general, the five economic components of New Democracy must be taken into overall consideration, especially in the issue of public-private relations. The state-owned economy is the national leading economy, and there is a difference between it and the private economy, but the government should treat the public and private sectors equally. We should handle the adjustment of industry and commerce issues based on this principle.

Finally, the meeting approved the establishment of four working groups: industry and commerce, taxation, labor-capital relations and unemployment relief, and district representative conferences, and designated Zhang Youyu, Qian Duansheng, Liu Ren, and Wu Han as conveners of each group.

　　市协商委员会举行会议  听取了调整公私工商业问题等报告     
    通过市府关于检查干部作风的建议
    【京市新闻处讯】北京市第二届各界人民代表会议协商委员会二十日下午三时在中山公园该会会议室举行第六次会议，听取了第六第七两区关于区各界人民代表会议筹备工作的报告；市人民法院关于清理积案工作的报告；讨论与通过了市人民政府关于检查干部作风与纪律、及召集京市党、政、群干部动员大会的建议。会议对京市调整工商业问题，听取了市财经委员会的报告，并决定由协商委员会成立工商、税收、劳资关系和失业救济及区代会议等四个组。
    李锐宋汝棼王斐然报告：
    筹开区人民代表会议和法院清理积案情况
    北京市第六区各界人民代表会议筹备委员会主任委员李锐和第七区各界人民代表会议筹备委员会主任委员宋汝棼先后在会上报告第六、第七两区的各界人民代表会议筹备工作进行情况。两个区都通过各种方式进行了宣传，并举行座谈会收集区内人民的意见，展开群众团体代表和街道居民代表的选举工作。由于这一工作在京市尚属首创，干部与群众都缺乏经验，因而曾发生过宣传工作不够深入、个别干部作风不够民主及方式生硬等缺点，现已在纠正中。
    继由市人民法院王斐然院长报告清理积案的进行情况。这项工作从本月十五日正式开始以来，每天清理的案件已从最初的每日清理三十件增到现在的八十件，预计下周每天可清理一百件。参加工作的干部在工作过程中，逐渐取得经验，开始克服了繁琐的文牍主义，提高了工作效率。
    张友渔副市长报告：
    将以六、七两区为重点开始检查干部作风纪律
    市人民政府张友渔副市长报告最近市政府准备进行一次检查干部作风与纪律的运动。为了突破一点，取得经验，准备以即将召开区各界人民代表会议的两个区为重点，首先进行检查，待取得经验之后，再在全市普遍展开。
    张副市长报告之后，协商委员会彭真主席即征询到会委员的意见，委员许德珩、费孝通、钱端升等相继发言，一致同意张副市长的建议。
    在会议进行中，许德珩委员、梁思成委员、钱端升委员等曾提出目前京市交通秩序又趋紊乱，车祸增多的问题，提请政府加以注意，对交通警察应加强负责，在市民中应进行宣传，对汽车司机和三轮车、人力车工人，亦应加强行车规则的训练。市公安局罗瑞卿局长当即表示接受这个建议，并且说明市公安局正在研究这种情况。现在除了继续强调说服教育，并同时开始执行必要的罚则以外，正在拟定重新整顿京市交通秩序的具体办法。
    市财委会副主任程宏毅报告：
    工商业调整问题及政府措施
    最后由市财经委员会副主任程宏毅就目前京市工商业调整问题及政府的措施作报告，他在分析了目前京市工商业基本情况之后，说：这个问题是比较复杂的，京财委会已作了初步研究，并与工商界人士广泛反复地交换了意见，目前市政府准备采取的措施，总的方针是继续贯彻中央人民政府平衡收支、稳定物价的精神，采取适当办法，使有益于国计民生的工商业在转变期中，减少困难，目前主要是调整公私关系，加强工商业方向的指导，并普遍建立劳资协商会议，由劳资双方协力，积极设法渡过目前的难关。同时，组织公私力量，吸收游资，向有益国计民生的工商业办理贷款。在税收方面，要做到公平合理，并简化手续，市税务局对一九四九年下半年工商业税滞纳户，其确系负担过重者已酌予减征或免征，因目前货物滞销，资金一时周转困难者，已按情况分别准予缓期缴纳。除以上一些措施外，市政府为了集中力量，公私配合，有效地解决目前京市工商业中存在的困难，已自财委会等财经机关调集干部，与市工商联合会筹委会的代表共六十余人，组成六个临时工作组，分头到困难较多的几个行业及工商业户中，作进一步的调查研究，动员劳资双方的积极性，在工商业者自身努力的基础上，协助解决目前可能解决的问题，在得到一些切实可行的办法与经验以后，再在全市工商业各行业中加以普遍推广。
    在程宏毅副主任报告之后，彭真主席曾就此一问题发表意见。他说：这是目前京市最重要、最中心的问题。总的方面，新民主主义五种经济要统筹兼顾，特别是在公私关系问题上。国营经济是国家领导经济，与私营经济两者间是有所不同的，但政府对待公营和私营却应当一视同仁。我们应本着这样的方针，来处理调整工商业问题。
    最后会议通过成立工商、税收、劳资关系和失业救济、区代表会议等四个工作组，并指定张友渔、钱端升、刘仁、吴晗等为各组召集人。
