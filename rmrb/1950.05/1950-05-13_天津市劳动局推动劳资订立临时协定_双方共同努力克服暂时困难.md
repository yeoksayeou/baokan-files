Tianjin Labor Bureau Promotes Labor-Management Agreement to Overcome Temporary Difficulties Through Joint Efforts

[Tianjin News] Tianjin Daily, May 11th news: In order to guide private industrial and commercial enterprises to overcome the temporary difficulties during the victory, the Tianjin Municipal People's Government Labor Bureau, following the establishment of a labor-management consultation supervision work group, has decided to universally promote the signing of temporary agreements between labor and management in private industrial and commercial enterprises. The aim is to solve the most important and urgent problems currently existing in various industries. The initial focus has been determined to be on six industries: flour, textiles, hardware, rubber, silk, and bricks and tiles. To ensure that all relevant parties can coordinate and cooperate closely in this work, the bureau convened a mobilization meeting on the 10th. More than 30 cadres from the Federation of Trade Unions, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, and the trade unions of production, textiles, hardware, chemicals, and shop employees attended the meeting. At the meeting, Director Chen Rong analyzed the current situation of private industrial and commercial enterprises in the city, pointing out that the temporary difficulties currently faced by private industrial and commercial enterprises must be solved immediately by labor and management. The past method of spending a long time negotiating collective contracts is no longer adapted to the current new situation. Therefore, after repeated research by the Labor Bureau and relevant parties, it was decided to adopt the method of promoting the signing of temporary agreements in various industries. The general spirit of this agreement is: 1. The spirit of mutual benefit between labor and management must be implemented in the face of difficulties, and both labor and management must share the difficulties and actively find ways to overcome them together. 2. Employees are required to strive to reduce costs, improve labor productivity, and improve production and quality. Wages should be reduced when necessary. 3. Address problems specific to a certain industry, clearly stipulate a few points, do not involve too broad a scope, and do not take too long, at most two weeks to complete an agreement. As for promoting this work, the following principles should be followed according to different situations: (1) For industries with good business, that have made more money in the past, have future development potential, and are only experiencing a very short period of slow sales, the status quo should generally be maintained, and costs should be reduced by reducing waste and increasing production; wages should not be generally reduced or workers dismissed. (2) For industries with temporary slow sales, those with raw materials, capital, and development prospects should actively rectify their operations to seek development. If the factory's economic situation is indeed relatively difficult, wages may be reduced at discretion, or a temporary piece-rate wage method may be adopted (pay according to the amount of work done). If the business situation is indeed deteriorating, measures such as workers taking turns going home can be considered, and wages should be appropriately reduced. (3) For those who have stopped work due to circumstances and cannot resume work in the short term, it is also necessary to appropriately take care of the workers' lives. If workers need to go home temporarily, the employer should provide a certain amount of travel expenses and living allowances. If they are indeed losing so much money that the workers' lives cannot be maintained, the method of retaining positions with suspended pay can be considered. (4) According to actual production needs, when industries that must reduce operations or change industries need to reduce personnel or dismiss employees, they can be handled according to the actual situation.

　　天津市劳动局推动劳资订立临时协定
　　双方共同努力克服暂时困难
    【天津讯】天津日报十一日消息：为了领导私营工商业克服胜利中的暂时困难，津市人民政府劳动局，继成立劳资协商督导工作组后，又决定普遍地推动私营工商业劳资双方订立临时协定，以解决各行业目前存在的最重要而急待解决的问题。首期工作重点已确定为面粉、纺织、五金、橡胶、绸缎、砖瓦等六个行业。为使各有关方面能在此工作中步骤一致，密切配合，该局曾于十日召开动员大会。与会者有总工会、工商局及产联、纺织、五金、化学、店员等工会干部三十余人。会中，陈荣局长分析了目前本市私营工商业的情况，指出：私营工商业目前面临着的暂时的困难，必须劳资双方立即共同设法解决。而过去花费很长时间，搞集体合同的方式，已经不能适应目前的新情况了。因此劳动局与各有关方面再三研究后，决定采取推动各行业订立临时协定的办法。这种协定总的精神是：一、必须在困难中，贯彻劳资两利的精神，要劳资双方共同分担困难，大家积极共同设法渡过困难。二、要求职工为减低成本而努力，提高劳动生产率，提高产、质量，必要时降低工资。三、针对某行业的困难解决问题，明确规定几条，涉及面不要太广，时间不要太长，顶多要两个星期搞好一个协定。至于推动此项工作，应分别情况，掌握以下的原则：（一）营业好的，过去赚钱较多今后还有发展只是极短期销路不畅的行业，一般应维持原状，从减少浪费，提高生产来降低成本；不应普遍减低工资及解雇工人。（二）暂时滞销的行业，其有原料有资本有发展前途者，应积极整顿业务，以图发展，如必要时厂方经济确实比较困难可酌情降低工资，或采取临时计件工资办法（作多少工，给多少钱）。营业情况确实恶劣者，可考虑采取工人轮流回家等办法，工资酌减。（三）因故停工后，短期不能复业者，亦需适当地照顾工人生活，如需工人暂时回家，资方应给予一定的路费和生活补助费，如确实亏累不堪，以致职工生活无法维持，可考虑采取留职停薪办法。（四）根据生产确实需要，必须缩小经营或转业的行业，需要减少人员或解雇职工时，可按实际情况斟酌处理。
