　　Village Chairman
    Fang Li
    Cao Jingxin, the instructor from Caofang, was elected chairman of the administrative village's People's Representative Conference. I was helping with the election in Caofang, and after the votes were announced, his father asked me:
    "Old Li, is the instructor's position bigger than the chairman's? Which one has more to manage?"
    I could tell he had some complaints about his son's work, and I felt he had backward ideas, so I vaguely answered him without paying much attention:
    "Ah! Uncle, you came to the meeting too. Did you vote for your son?"
    Because I had work in other villages, after the election, I told Jingxin to tally up the numbers for a sideline production item that night—how many people were contracted to transport coal—and then I hurriedly left Caofang.
    Before Cao Jingxin even left the venue, people came to him to solve problems, and he was busy until dark. After finishing his soup, he went to work in the finance and food department and in the winter school. It wasn't until late after Samsung pointed due south that he finished his work for the day. When he got home, his father wasn't asleep yet. Hearing the clanging of the door opening, he muttered:
    "Is that Jingxin coming back? Huh? Coming back this late, running around outside all day, never getting his hands dirty. The manure in the pen hasn't been cleared for almost a month, and the sorghum in Beiwali hasn't been brought home yet. Don't you care about any of this?! If I were young and strong, I wouldn't ask you to work even if I had a few more acres of land. I wouldn't stop you from going into a tiger's den to catch a tiger! Hey! Don't you know that your mother has a chronic illness and can't do heavy lifting, and I'm already in my seventies and eighties. Don't expect the old couple to take care of you!"
    His father had been a hired laborer for many years, never knowing how to go to markets or drink wine. He was indeed an outstanding hard worker, but after many years he only managed to save two dou of grain and a bolt of white homespun cloth, and he wasn't married until he was thirty-six or thirty-seven. One year, some famine refugees came from the eastern countryside, and a bad kid in the village said to him: "Old Cao, your luck has come. Two dou of grain and a bolt of cloth can be exchanged for a young virgin girl. Are you in?" That same year, his father married his mother. His mother was only seventeen years old. The bad kid secretly took half of the goods and made cold remarks on the side: "Oh! Old Cao is just picking up bargains. Look, he has such a big daughter without even marrying a wife!" After marrying, his mother also worked as a cook for the old landlord, working so hard every day that she couldn't catch her breath. Especially in the hot June weather, taking care of meals for a dozen short-term workers, she would sweat all over during lunch and couldn't leave the kitchen until late in the afternoon. After four or five years, his mother contracted tuberculosis, coughing constantly after working for a while. Jingxin was born the second year after his mother married. His mother went back to work just one month after giving birth to Jingxin without much rest. From then on, his mother had another burden, not only cooking for the landlord but also taking time to go home to nurse the baby. At that time, before his mother went to cook for the landlord, she would put Jingxin on the bed, weighed down by a sandbag made of coarse cloth. When she came back, Jingxin would have sand all over his nose and mouth from scratching, and she could only secretly shed tears. His parents slowly raised Jingxin, and then took care of marrying him a wife, adding people but not adding anything else, making life even harder.
    At that time, his father had no place to complain, so he could only grumble at his son, and the son could only silently endure without saying a word. It wasn't until after the land reform and liberation that their bitter days ended, but his father still constantly complained about Jingxin neglecting his own work.
    This day, Jingxin came back from work with his head buzzing, yawning constantly. Hearing his father grumbling, he didn't say a word out of habit, gently closed the door, pushed his wife and children further inside, and went to bed without taking off his clothes.
    The next day, his father came back after collecting a cart of manure, and Jingxin still hadn't gotten up. He was furious:
    "Sleeping late only counts if you can get up early! Look at whose family doesn't go out early to collect manure and sweep leaves…"
    Before his father could stop, Xicheng from the north-south alley came into the yard and asked, "Uncle! Is Brother Jingxin home?" His father replied, "He hasn't gotten up yet!" and went to sit by the pot to smoke in silence.
    Xicheng burst into the room, and Jingxin just sat up, putting on his shoes. His father heard Xicheng grumbling to Jingxin: "Someone must have stolen the jujube saplings from my family's western field… Gosh! No messing around… I took a turn there early this morning, and I saw… Come on, I'll take you… This time, we have to set an example for those who disrupt production!"
    The sweet potatoes had been dug for three days and hadn't been put in the kiln yet, piled up in the courtyard, covered with fresh sweet potato vines. The bellows had already been set up in the kitchen, but no heat was coming from the pot.
    While having breakfast, Xicheng chatted in the kitchen. As soon as he put down his bowl, Xicheng urged Jingxin to go with him. His wife said, "Go after you carry a load of water, so you won't be missed when it's time to cook!" Xicheng intervened on Jingxin's behalf: "Is it too late to carry water at noon? Sister-in-law, if Brother Jingxin misses something, I'll carry two loads for you!" His father interrupted, "That sounds nice, but you take care of everything so neatly at your house, and our work is left in a mess!"
    Jingxin felt uneasy and reluctantly followed Xicheng out. At the gate, he explained to Xicheng:
    "Your uncle is old and his eyesight and hearing aren't good, so what he says isn't always right!"
    Some jujube saplings had been moved from the northern end of Xicheng's western jujube orchard. Scattered dry jujube branches, trampled footprints, were clearly visible. Xicheng led Jingxin to look for a while, stopped and pointed, saying: "Brother Jingxin: Look, didn't they stop here for a moment, with their toes pointing towards the village, surely looking for someone?" Continuing to walk, continuing to speak: "It's definitely 'Er Quanzi' who stole it, no doubt about it, the footprints of the bow-legged, the toes point inwards, and the heels stick outwards. …Besides him, who else in our village?" Walking further, he stopped again and said: "Brother Jingxin, look at this trampled area, isn't this where they were loading the basket?" On the field head, he pointed to "Er Quanzi"'s small garden hut, let Jingxin casually glanced at it, and said to him: "Look, the footprints step there."
    The two tracked the footprints to the small garden hut, a string of footprints tracing to a breach in “Er Quanzi’s” backyard wall. Jingxin figured out there was an 80% chance that “Er Quanzi” stole the jujube saplings.
    Jingxin thought for a while about how to solve the case? How to resolve it? In these few days, many things one after another flooded his heart – “The accounts for the desks and benches made in winter school haven’t been settled,” “A family in the east end is not harmonious, and haven’t done anything for three days out of spite,” “Caofang and Masi are divided into one administrative village, and Auntie Biao of Masi is quarreling to get her daughter divorced,” “The number of coal transporters hasn’t been tallied,” “A production meeting has to be held at night”…
    After arguing over the reasoning, Auntie Biao of Masi and her daughter-in-law, shortly after Jingxin and Xicheng went to the western jujube orchard, came to Jingxin’s house one after the other. Once seated, they began to blather: “Old brother, I’m not afraid of you laughing at me, your cousin cannot live in the same house with this family, ask our cousin to give me a way out, to take charge!” She said her daughter and son-in-law didn't get along, and must get divorced, but really, it was because her son-in-law was doing business in Tianjin, and she was afraid it would be hard to see each other again if her daughter went with him. The mother-in-law knew she was deceiving her daughter to divorce, and exposed her true intentions: “If you want to say that children don’t get along, you don’t know as much as I do – during wheat harvest, his father bought six apricots at the market, and my child took four of them to his room in one go, just think, he only left one for each of his own parents!” Not waiting for the mother-in-law to stop, she still insisted "anyway, they can't live together". The mother-in-law also urgently interrupted: “You just say that kind of thing! If you keep talking like that, it won’t sound good, like when my son came back the other time, so many people asked him to go out and play, but he wouldn’t move, the couple whispered for half the night, and the next day, the sun was high in the sky but they hadn’t gotten up yet, and his brother and sister secretly poked holes in the window paper and sprinkled dirt on the bed…” The two mothers-in-law, one sentence after another, argued back and forth. Jingxin’s father went to the street to look for Jingxin three times in a row, but couldn't find him, but if he didn't stay and talk, people would say he wasn't understanding, and he was so annoyed that he went to look for him a fourth time.
    At this time, Jingxin and Xicheng had already returned to the eastern end of the village, Xicheng went home to stack bean leaves, and Jingxin started talking to the people.
    In October, the fields and threshing grounds were all finished, and the village’s oil press and cotton gin were even busier. Some people went to Nanlu to sell red dates, others went to Xishan to haul coal, and the remaining people were either stripping cotton bolls, tying sorghum stalks, catching lice for livestock, or just standing on the street gossiping idly.
    Jingxin asked everyone he met:
    “Are you going to haul coal? Are you burning kilns? There’s no big work to do right now, so come to my place tonight to sign up, Old Li will be back tomorrow, so hurry up and get your name on the list so we can get started.”
    He told those who signed up to have Jingxin remember, saying that it would save him a trip tonight. Some complained: “Before, when we transferred materials for the public, we signed up but didn’t get to go, so will this time be accurate?”
    Jingxin suddenly heard his father shout: "Aren't you coming home soon, your Auntie Biao from Masi has been waiting for you for half her life!" Afraid of his father getting angry, he hurried home. At the gate, he saw his wife and mother struggling to carry two buckets of water. Although his mother's life had improved in the past two years and her old ailment wasn't much of a problem anymore, she still panted heavily when she carried water quickly. He felt a burning sensation in his heart.
    Jingxin entered the courtyard, the two mothers-in-law, one "Nephew, listen to what I have to say," the other "Chairman, listen to me," whimpering and moaning, both vying to recount what they had just said to him.
    As night fell, the family in the east end that was not harmonious started arguing loudly. The man wanted to hit the woman, and the woman was shouting to find the chairman to reason with her.
    Jingxin slept even later this night than last night. When he got home, fortunately his father was fast asleep and didn't hear any noise.
    Hauling coal and burning kilns are very important winter sideline productions. The district cooperative has decided to vigorously support it. This will not only lay the foundation for turning dry land into paddy fields by digging wells next spring, but also find a way for many laborers to make a living in the winter. The district contracts to transport coal, collecting only thirty jin for every hundred jin, and the masses can earn seventy jin in transportation fees, and lend the transported coal to the kiln burners. In this area, I have been mobilizing, brewing, and organizing for several days. Last night, I tallied the number of people organized in other villages, and this morning I hurriedly went to Caofang, planning to take the number of people surveyed by Jingxin and go back to the district to unify the arrangements so that we can start taking action immediately.
    I came to Jingxin’s house, almost the same as when Xicheng came to his house yesterday. Because I was very familiar with his family during the Self-Defense War and the Land Reform, I asked the old man and then barged into his room. No wonder the old man’s tone sounded unhappy when he answered me, Jingxin was still lying in bed with his head covered. I lifted the quilt and looked at his face, and he hadn't noticed yet. I cut a piece of shoelace from his wife’s sewing basket and put it in his ear and twisted it, and he woke up with a start.
    “Old Li! What’s the matter?”
    I was so impatient that I wanted to dig the number of coal transporters out of his mouth:
    “How many people in your village are hauling coal? How’s the kiln burning going?”
    “Oh dear! We didn't hold a meeting yesterday, I haven't had any free time these past two days!"
    I asked him:
    "Why haven't you gotten up yet?"
    "How can I get up!" he said with a yawn, stretching his body.
    I estimated that there was a problem with the work in this village, so I decided to help them solve it and return to the district later. After breakfast, I helped him store sweet potatoes in the kiln and gathered information. At first, he complained to me a lot, "The masses' affairs are complicated," "The family work is left in a mess," "The old people are complaining," "There are also disagreements among the village cadres."
    He thought silently for a while and said to me:
    "Right now, doing work is more difficult than during the war. We can't even use a little 'toughness', and if there's even a tiny flaw, the masses will cry out…"
    Then, I analyzed the situation in this village: The public security officer is an old party member and has a good way of working, how did he not handle the case of the village losing jujube saplings? In theory, it is his responsibility to protect production. How did the other cadres do their work?
    After helping Jingxin store the sweet potatoes, I went elsewhere to talk, and during lunch, I called all the branch committee members together and studied the matter again. Most of them reflected: Jingxin took the lead in everything, and other cadres were unwilling to take the initiative. I asked everyone: "How many people in your village are transporting coal, is everyone clear?" One after another, they told Jingxin to answer me: "Let Jingxin talk about it!" I asked the public security officer how the matter of Xicheng losing jujube saplings in the village was handled? He said, "Didn't Xicheng ask Jingxin to investigate?"
    There was a hint of Jingxin taking on all the work in the words, Jingxin heard it and said out of breath:
    "People come to us, we are Communist Party members, serving the masses, how can we push it away and not care?!"
    Everyone was silent for a while, looking at my face, seemingly saying:
    "Old Li, what do you think we should do?"
    I considered it for a moment and said to Jingxin:
    "It's good that you are active and willing to take responsibility, naturally. But can you really grasp all the problems of the masses and solve them for them? Right now, you've divided up the administrative villages and you've taken on the work of Masi - another village... There are even more things to do, if you don't change your work style and strengthen leadership, the work is divided among everyone to do, how can it work?"
    Everyone looked as if they had my support and began to speak:
    "How much can one person push with a small 'earth ox', if you want to manage a big load, you have to harness mules and horses, and when they run, it's completely different!"
    "Yes! In the future, we can't shrink back from our work, and besides, the cadres of the People's Representative Conference - like the director of the administrative committee, what he says in our village is very effective, and people also know that clearly in their hearts, in the future, don't look at the fact that the work has become bigger, as long as everyone works together, there won't be any 'big obstacles'!"
    Jingxin sighed a long breath: "Sigh!" Obviously he was thinking: "I put in the effort, got complaints, and received criticism." Looking at his face, there was not a trace of a smile, his brows were tightly frowned.
    We studied for a while longer, and decided that the work should be "discussed together and carried out in division of labor", and finally planned to convene the People's Representative Conference at night to discuss and decide.
    The People's Representative Conference at night was held in the outer room of the cooperative. Jingxin shouted on the "radio station" and personally ran to get people. The neighboring representatives had already arrived after hearing the shout, and we casually talked about how big the sideline production was, the distance of the coal transportation, and the dispatch of people and livestock.
    After the administrative director arrived, we chatted casually for a while, and I deliberately asked him:
    "The second aunt in the east end of your clan has been angry for several days, why haven't you taken care of it?"
    "Didn't the chairman go to her house to solve the problem!" he said as if he had no responsibility himself.
    I jokingly said to him:
    "You are the administrative director! You've taken the 'official' and received the 'seal', and you still don't know how to 'hold court and manage affairs'!"
    There was a burst of laughter in the room, and he was very embarrassed, but he still said: "It's fine if the chairman does it!"
    I also mentioned the divorce of the family in Masi, which was his "maternal aunt's family". Not only should he take care of it, but he also had convenient conditions to do so. First, he pushed it away, saying that it was because they hadn't come to him, but later he revealed his inner thoughts: he felt that he was not a party member, had not been trained and didn't know the way, and couldn't bear the responsibility if he made a mistake. I explained to him that everyone should do things together and be responsible together. The other comrades in the branch also agreed with "yes, yes".
    When everyone was there, we first discussed several specific tasks in the village, and then proceeded to study them. The result of the study was that all major events in the village must be discussed and decided by the People's Representative Conference, and then carried out in division of labor by the production, cultural and educational, administrative, and other committees and other departments. If they cannot be resolved, they will ask the chairman again. Usually, the chairman can go to the area where the work is urgent. Each department consciously takes responsibility. For example, the chairman does not have to personally manage the accounts for making desks and benches in winter school. In case of major work or temporary tasks, we will study it again and do it together.
    After discussing the issue, Jingxin's face looked so relaxed. Obviously, he still had some complaints at the beginning, but now they were resolved. Some representatives even stayed to chat for a while before leaving. Early the next morning, everyone gathered the number of coal transporters into a pile in the dining area, and after breakfast, I hurriedly set off to return to the district. That day, the coal transportation work was uniformly arranged.
    A few days later, I went to Caofang to arrange new work, taking time to do an inspection -
    The public security officer went to "Er Quanzi"'s house to investigate the day after the meeting. "Er Quanzi" was guilty and spoke first: "I haven't been moving much these days, I haven't been out much!" The public security officer understood and interrupted indifferently: "You haven't been out much these days, but it just so happens that someone has lost something!" "Er Quanzi" said: "I haven't heard of it!" The public security officer said: "I have investigated who stole it!" At that time, the public security officer found the stolen goods in "Er Quanzi"'s house. Submit to the People’s Representative Assembly for processing according to the “Production Covenant”, ask Xicheng himself to take back the jujube saplings, ask “Er Quanzi” to formulate a production plan, and supervise him to work well.
    With Jingxin's help, the administrative director personally resolved the dispute in the family of the second aunt in his clan, and others also began to come to him to solve problems. After going to Masi twice in person, that family's divorce was no longer mentioned. Originally, the young couple didn't want to divorce, but were only influenced by the elderly. The administrative director persuaded the elderly to change their minds, and the problem was solved.
    Pointless disputes and quarrels in the village are decreasing day by day…
    Cao Jingxin did not slack off in his work after that meeting, he was still very active, busy with the work he had accumulated, chatting with the cadres early and late every day, and personally doing things in his spare time. The central task of winter is production, and these days the masses are enthusiastically transporting coal. He and the cadres of the production committee often help the masses solve the difficulties in transporting coal. As the chairman, he cannot be away from home for a long time, so he combines livestock and carts into a coal transportation team with others.
    I had this early breakfast at Jingxin’s house again. When I opened the pot, the sweet potatoes were steaming hot and bursting with purple skins, making people want to reach out and grab one to put in their mouths. Jingxin said to me happily:
    “Slowly, everyone has work to do. This winter, we want to make sure there are no idlers in the whole village!”
    Jingxin’s father let me eat and sit - I often thought of an interesting thing when I saw him: During the Self-Defense War, Jingxin went out to fight guerrillas, and the old man could not stand the destruction and oppression of the enemy. One night, Jingxin went home to scout the situation, and he anxiously and flusteredly asked Jingxin: “Where are the Liberation Army? Do the Liberation Army have many 'grenades' and 'machine guns'?” After asking, he was afraid that the enemy would discover the stove fire, so he did not dare to boil water, and sent Jingxin away from home. Later, it spread, and people often asked Jingxin, joking about the “grenades” and “machine guns”.
    He is worthy of respect in many ways, but he is old and his eyesight and hearing are not good, so he often makes people laugh. I asked him:
    “Uncle, these days, do you think the instructor’s position is bigger, or the chairman’s position is bigger? What does he manage more?”
    He didn’t talk about what I said, but spoke his own mind:
    “If it’s like these days, the old folks don’t have to get angry!”
    After breakfast, I went to work with Jingxin, first studying how to arrange the new work in the village. Walking on the street, I saw several coal transporting carts entering the village, and those who had returned early were hooking up their harnesses, preparing to pull a second trip.

专栏：

　　村主席
    方立
    曹坊的指导员曹景新当选行政村人民代表会主席了。我在曹坊帮助选举，在宣布过选票以后，他爹问我：
    “老李，是指导员干部大？还是主席干部大？啥管的事多？”
    一听就知道他老人家对儿子作工作有意见，我觉得他有落后思想，不在意的含糊着回答他：
    “啊！大爷，你也到会啦，你投你儿的票了吗？”
    我因为别的村上还有工作，结束选举以后，交代景新晚上统计出来一项副业生产的数目字——有多少人包运煤炭，便急忙离开曹坊走了。
    曹景新并没走出会场就有人来找他去解决问题，一直忙到天黑。喝罢汤又到财粮股和冬学里忙活，三星正南后好一大会，才算办完了这一天的工作。回到家里的时候，爹还没睡着觉，听见咣当咣当的开门，嘟噜着：
    “是景新回来了吗？咹？天到这般晚才回来，一天到晚的在外头跑，手没摸着活的时候，圈里的粪快一月没除了，北洼里的秫秸还没拉家来，这你一点都不往心上搁吗？！要是我年轻少壮的，地再多几亩也不攀你做活，你到老虎窝里掏老虎去也不拦你！哎！你又不是不知道，你娘有个老病根子不能出重力，我也是七老八十的人啦，再别打算这老两口子操办给你吃！”
    爹当过很多年雇工，常年不知道集怎么赶、酒怎么喝，的确是一个出众的操力汉，不过很多年才总共落下二斗粮食，一匹白土布，到三十六七还没娶媳妇。有一年打东乡里来了逃荒的，庄上的一个坏孩子对他说：“老曹，你的时运来啦，二斗粮一匹布能换一个黄花幼女，你干不？”就在这一年，爹娶的娘。娘才十七岁。坏孩子把东西瞒背下一半，又在一旁说冷话：“咦！老曹净拾便宜，看，他没娶媳妇就有这样大的闺女啦！”娘娶过来也给老东家当做饭的，打头一上工，就天天累的喘不过气来；特别是在热火六月天，照应十几号短工吃饭，忙晌午饭热的满头大汗，到半天夕出不了厨屋门。过了四五年，娘便得了痨伤病，做一会活便喀喀的老咳嗽。景新是在娘娶后的第二年生的，娘生过景新刚满月，没大憩身子又上了工。从此，娘又添加了一层负担，不光在东家做饭，还得抽空回家来奶孩子。当时，娘临到东家去做饭以前，用沙土布袋把景新坠压在床上，等回来一看，景新抓挠的鼻子嘴上净沙土，只有暗暗的掉眼泪。爹娘慢慢的把景新抚养大，又操办着娶了儿媳妇，添人不添东西，日子更没法过了。
    那时候，爹有苦没处诉，只好嘟噜儿，当儿的也只有闷着头不哼声。直到土改翻身以后，他们的那种苦日子才结束了，不过，爹对景新作工作误自家的活，还不断发牢骚。
    这天，景新办完工作回来，头嗡嗡的叫，打着“哈哈”，听见爹嘟噜，习惯的没哼气，轻轻的掩上门，把老婆孩子往里推了推，没脱衣裳躺床上就睡了。
    第二天，爹拾了一圈子粪回来，景新还没有起床，心里咕嘟嘟的火：
    “睡晚了要能早起来才算有本事哩！你看谁家不早早的去拾粪、扫叶子……”
    爹还没住口，南北拐里的喜成走到院里来，问：“大爷！景新哥在家吗？”爹答了一句：“还没起哩！”独自走到锅门口坐下去吸闷烟。
    喜成闯到屋里，景新才摺起身子，正穿着鞋。爹听见喜成向景新咕嘟着：“我大家西的枣树股子准是‘二圈子’搬去啦……吓！一点也不含糊……我早起打那里转了一遭，一看……走，我领你……这回得给扰乱生产的办个样子看看！”
    红薯刨了三天了还没下窑，在当院里堆着，盖着鲜红薯秧。厨屋里早已住了风箱，锅口上不冒热气了。
    掀开锅吃着饭，喜成跟到厨屋里说闲话。刚推下碗，喜成又催着景新跟他走。老婆说：“你打挑子水再走吧，省得到做饭的时候抓不到你！”喜成替景新遮拦着：“挨晌午再挑还晚唠？嫂子，景新哥要误了事，我来给你挑两挑子！”爹接过口来：“说的怪好听，你家的活啥都办的利利索索的，俺的活可撂下一扑摊！”
    景新心里七上八下，硬着头皮跟喜成走出去，到大门口，对喜成解释着说：
    “你大爷年纪大啦，眼花耳聋的，说出话来就不照地方！”
    喜成大家西的枣树行，靠北头被搬走了一些枣股子。拉撒的干枣枝棒，扑踏的脚底印，显显亮亮的。喜成领景新看了一会，停住指点着说：“景新哥：你看，这不是在这里停了一下，脚尖印朝着村子，准是望人哩。”继续走着，继续说着：“是‘二圈子’偷的一点也不屈他，箩圈腿走过的脚印，脚尖印向里勾，脚后跟向外撇撇的。……除了他咱庄上还有谁？”再走走，又停住说：“景新哥，你看扑踏的这一片，这不是在这里装的背篓？”到地头上，向“二圈子”的小园屋间一指，让景新顺手望了一眼，对他说：“看吧，脚底印向那里踏过去了。”
    两人跟踪追迹到小园屋间，一串脚底印照着“二圈子”家后墙豁口间拐过去，景新判定有八成是“二圈子”偷搬的枣股子了。
    景新想了一会怎么破案？怎么解决？这几天里接二连三的许多事情又涌到他心里来——“冬学里作桌子板凳的账没有算”，“东头有家不和睦的，睹气三天没作啥了”，“曹坊和马寺划成一个行政村，马寺的表大娘给闺女闹离婚”，“运炭的人数没统计”，“晚上得开生产会”……
    马寺的表大娘和亲家婆争了一会理，在景新跟喜成到家西枣行里去了不久，便一前一后找到景新家里来，落了坐就嘟嘟噜噜开了腔：“老哥哥，我这也不怕你笑话啦，你表侄女反正给这家子人家过不到一堆了，叫你家俺表侄给我出个路数，给我作主！”她说闺女和女婿合不来，一定得离婚，其实呢，是因为女婿在天津作买卖，怕闺女跟走了以后难得再相见。亲家婆知道她拐故闺女离婚，光掀她的话露缝：“亲家，要说小孩合不来，你可没我摸的清——闪过麦，他爹赶集买来六个杏，俺那孩子一下拿到他那屋里四个，你想想，给他亲爹亲娘一个人才留一个呀！”她不等亲家婆停嘴，还一口咬定“反正过不到一堆去”。亲家婆也急的拦话头：“你光说那中呗！亲家，要再往下说的话就不中听啦，比方俺小那趟回来，晚上那么多人叫他出去玩也叫不动他，两口子咕唧了半夜，二天太阳出多高还没起来，嫂嫂弟弟戳破窗户纸偷偷的向床上撒土……”两个亲家婆，你一句我一句的分辩着。景新爹一连到当街找景新三趟，都没找见影，但不陪着说话去做活，又怕人家说他不通人情事故，实在听烦了又去找第四趟。
    这时候，景新和喜成已经回到庄东头，喜成拐家去垛豆叶，景新和人们拉起话来。
    十月里，地里场里都忙完了，村里的油房，花弓，更忙活起来，有的人上南路去贩卖红枣，也有人到西山去拉炭，余下的人们，有些在剥着棉花桃，栓着秫秸栓，给牲口捉着虱子，再懒散点的站到街上东扯葫芦西扯瓢。
    景新逢人便问：
    “你拉炭去不？你烧窑吗？这会又没大活了，晚上到我那里报个名吧，老李明天就回来，赶快给他落个名单好动手。”
    当时报名的叫景新记住，说晚上省得再去一趟啦。有的抱怨着：以前给公家转运物资，报上名没能去，这回准头呗？
    景新忽然听见爹喊了一声：“还不快家来，马寺的你表大娘快等你半辈子啦！”他怕爹动气，赶快回家走，到大门口间，看见老婆和娘噗哧噗哧抬着两桶水。娘虽然这二年生活过好了些，老病根快不大妨事了，但抬水走快了还呼呼喘。他觉得心里热辣辣的。
    景新进了院，两亲家婆，你“表侄呀，听我给你说”，她“主席，你听我说说吧”，呜呜呀呀，都抢着把刚才说过的话，重新再向他数落。
    天落黑的时候，东头那家不和睦的，大吵起来了。男人要打女人，女人吵着去找主席来评理。
    景新这夜比昨夜睡的更晚，回到家里的时候，幸亏爹睡得死死的，没听见啥动静。
    拉炭、烧窑是很重要的一项冬季副业生产，区合作社决定大力扶植，这不但给明春打井变旱田为水田打下基础，冬季还能为很多劳力找出生产的门路。区里包运煤炭，每百斤净收三十斤，群众可以挣到七十斤的运输费，将运的煤炭贷给烧窑户。我在这一片村里，发动、酝酿、组织了好几天了，凑昨天夜里，把其他村组织起来的人数统计好，今早急忙拐到曹坊来，打算捎着景新调查的人数，回区统一布置一下，好马上行动起来。
    我来到景新家，和昨天喜成来他家的时候差不多，因为在自卫战争和土地改革期间和他家混的透熟，问了老大爷一声，便闯到他屋里去。怨不得老大爷回答我的时候，听话音显着不高兴，景新还蒙头裹肚的在床上躺着。我掀开被头看了看他的脸，他还没发觉。我从他老婆针线筐里，剪下一段纳鞋底绳，向他耳朵眼里一搁捻，他“啊啊”的惊醒了。
    “老李！有啥事？”
    我性急的恨不得一下从他口里掏出运炭的人数来：
    “你庄上有多少拉炭的？烧窑的怎么样了？”
    “哎呀！昨天没开成会，这两天一点空也没有！”
    我问他道：
    “你怎么还没起呢？”
    “我怎么能起来唠！”他打着“哈哈”，舒展着身子说。
    我估量到这村的工作有问题，决定帮他们解决一下，晚天再回区。吃过早饭，帮他向窑里收藏着红薯，拉着情况。开初，他向我诉了好多苦，“群众的事杂”，“家里活撂下一扑摊”，“老人抱怨”，“村干中间也有意见”。
    他闷着头想了一会对我说：
    “目下作工作比战争时候更难啦，连一点‘强硬’也不敢使，有一星漏缝，群众便哇哇的提出来……”
    接着，我分析着这村的情况：公安员是个老党员，工作很有办法，村上少枣股子，他怎么不处理？论说，保卫生产是他的责任。其他的干部又怎么作的工作呢？
    帮景新收藏完红薯，我到别处去交谈，凑吃完午饭的时间，找来全体支部委员，又研究了一番。大都反映：什么都由景新承头作啦，别的干部不愿再抢着插手。我问大家：“你们庄上运炭的有多少人，都清楚不？”一个接一个的叫景新回答我：“叫景新说说吧！”问公安员庄上的喜成少枣股子的事怎么弄的？他说：“喜成不是叫景新调查去了么？”
    话里有景新包揽工作的意思，景新听出来了，气不顺的说：
    “人家都找到咱跟前来，咱是个共产党员，为群众服务，那能推出去不管？！”
    大家好一阵子没有发言，看看我的脸，似乎在说：
    “老李，你看怎么办吧？”
    我考虑了一下，对景新说：
    “你工作积极，肯负责任，自然是好的。可是群众的一切问题难道你都能够一手抓过来替他们解决了吗？眼前划了行政村，你又多担负了马寺——一个村的工作……事情是更多了，要不改变你的作风，加强领导，工作由大家商量着分头去做，怎么能走的通呢？”
    大家看着得到了我的支持，接着发起言来：
    “一个人推一辆小‘土牛’能推多大点东西，要收拾挂大车，套上骡子马，咕咕噜噜跑起来，到底两样！”
    “是呀！以后我们对工作也不能往后缩，再说，人民代表会的干部——比方行政委员会主任吧，人家在咱村上说句话很顶事，人心里也利亮，以后别看工作大了，只要大家齐心，办起来也走不了‘大梗’！”
    景新长长的叹了口气：“咳！”显然他心里在想着：“出了力，落了抱怨，受了批评。”看看他的脸，没有一丝笑模样，眉头紧紧的皱着。
    我们又研究了一会，作工作应该“共同讨论，分工进行”，最后计划晚上召开人民代表会，讨论后决定。
    晚上的人民代表会议是在合作社的外间里召开的，景新在“广播台”上吆喝了一下，又亲自跑着去串通。邻近的代表听见吆喝已先到场了，我们随便谈着什么副业生产生息大，谈着运炭来回的路程，人和牲口的调度。
    行政主任来到以后，又随便扯了一会，我有意的问他：
    “东头你旁门的二婶子家生了几天气了，你怎么也没管管？”
    “主席不是到她家解决问题去了么！”他好像自己没有责任的说。
    我又闹耍似的对他讲：
    “你这个行政主任！当了‘官’接了‘印’了，还不知道‘升堂理事’哩！”
    屋里哈哈笑了一阵，他很不好意思，仍然说：“有主席作了就行了呗！”
    我又提到马寺的那家离婚的，那是他“舅老娘”家，他不但应该管，而且管起来还有便利条件。先上来他推托着是因为没有来找他，后来露出内心话：觉着不是党员，没受过锻炼懂得路数少，办错了担不起。我向他解释着，大家的事情大家办，由大家负责任。支部里的其他几个同志也“对呀对呀”的赞成着。
    人到齐了，先讨论了村中几项具体的工作，接着就进行研究，研究的结果决定以后凡是村上的大事一定要经过人民代表会议讨论和决定，然后由生产、文教、行政等各委员会以及其他部门分工进行。解决不了的再去问主席。平常主席看到那里工作紧要可多到那里去作。各部门自觉的负起责任来，譬如冬学里作桌子板凳的账不必主席亲手管。遇到重大工作或临时任务，再另研究，共同来作。
    讨论完问题，景新的脸上显得那么舒展，显然地，他开始还有些抱怨的思想，这时得到解决了。有的代表还留下闲拉了一阵才都回去了。二天清早，大家在吃饭场里，把拉炭的人数往一堆拢了拢，饭后我急忙动身回区上去。当天把拉炭工作统一布置下来。
    过了几天，我到曹坊布置新的工作，抽空作了一番检查——
    公安员在那天开过会，第二天便到“二圈子”家去调查，“二圈子”因为心虚先开口：“我这几天懒怠动，没大出门！”公安员心里明白，爱理不理的插上一嘴：“这几天你没大出门，碰巧就有人少了东西啦！”“二圈子”说：“我还没听说哩！”公安员说：“我可调查出是谁偷的来了！”当时公安员就从“二圈子”家翻出来东西。提交人民代表会按“生产公约”处理，喜成的枣股子叫本人认走，让“二圈子”订出生产计划，监督他好好劳动。
    行政主任由景新帮助着亲手解决了旁门二婶子家的纠纷，别人有事也开始上门找他来解决了。他亲自到马寺跑了两趟以后，那家离婚的也不再提了。本来小两口并没出心离婚，只因受了老人的牵扯。行政主任劝转了老人的心意，问题就解决啦。
    村子里无谓的纠纷争吵，一天一天在减少着……
    曹景新从那天开完会工作并没懈怠，仍然是很积极，他忙着积下的一扑摊活，见天一早一晚和干部们拉扯，抽空亲自动手作。冬季中心工作是生产，这几天群众正热烈的运着炭，他常和生产委员会的干部，一齐帮群众解决着运炭的困难。自己是主席不能久出门，用牲口和大车同别人结合一个运炭组。
    这顿清早饭我又是在景新家吃的，掀开锅，红薯热得紫溜溜的暴着皮，叫人看见不由的就想伸手拿一块填到嘴里，厨屋里冒着饭食的香味。景新高兴的对我说：
    “慢慢的都有活做了，今年冬天要使全村没闲人！”
    景新爹向我让饭让坐——我见了他常常想起一段有趣的事：自卫战争期间，景新出外打游击，他老人家熬不住敌人的摧残和压迫，有一夜景新探情况钻到家里来，他眼巴巴的慌慌张张问景新：“解放军在那里啦？解放军的‘弹手榴’‘枪机关’多不？”问罢，又怕起灶火烟敌人发觉了，连水也不敢烧，便打发景新离开家。后来传出去，常常有人问景新“弹手榴”“枪机关”的逗着趣。
    他老人家有很多地方值得受人敬，不过年纪大了，眼花耳聋的，常常惹人笑话。我问他：
    “大爷，这几天你看着是指导员干部大？还是主席干部大？啥管的事多？”
    他不照我的话头上谈，自己说着自己的心意：
    “要是像这些日子似的，当老的咧倒底是免气生！”
    吃罢饭，我跟景新去做活，先研究一下村里的新工作如何布置。走到街上，看见有几辆运炭的车正进村子，早回来的又挂上套，准备去再拉第二趟。
