Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 8th: The members of the New Democratic Youth League in northern Anhui have played a significant role in uniting the people in disaster areas to overcome the famine. Last December, as the disaster in northern Anhui gradually worsened, the Anhui North Youth League Committee and the Communist Youth League Committee of the region jointly issued a letter to Youth League members, calling on the vast number of young people to unite the people in disaster areas and overcome the famine. In January and February of this year, Su County, Fuyang, Anqing and other special districts generally convened county and district Youth League representative conferences and youth representative congresses to further implement the policy of production for disaster relief, making the Youth League an organized, core, and vanguard shock force in the production and disaster relief movement. For example, in Liangyang Zhang Village in Su County, when many disaster victims were preparing to flee the famine, the Youth League members, under the call of the Communist Party and the People's Government, took the lead in organizing more than 80 households of disaster victims to engage in sideline production such as fishing and lotus root digging, achieving considerable results and reversing the ideas of waiting for relief and the pessimistic mood among the disaster victims. In many places, female Youth League members have also actively participated in sideline production and spring plowing, becoming an important force in promoting and organizing the participation of women in production. Wei Cairong, a female Youth League member from Dazhao Village in Lingbi County, took the lead in pulling the plow when most of the men went out to repair river embankments. This method was promoted through the county's women's representative conference, greatly solving the difficulties of lack of labor and livestock in the county's spring plowing. In large-scale water control and embankment repair, a large number of Youth League members demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm, ensuring the successful completion of the work. Many Youth League members have been awarded the titles of labor models or labor heroes. For example, in the restoration of the Wangjiang Dam, seventy-eight League members were named models, and sixty-nine League members gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. Among the twenty-two labor heroes selected by the Huai embankment Tuoxi Brigade, sixteen were Youth League members.

　　皖北青年团员带头生产救灾
    【新华社上海八日电】皖北新民主主义青年团的团员们在团结灾区人民战胜灾荒中起了很大作用。去年十二月，皖北灾荒逐渐发展，皖北团委和该区中共青委联合发表了告青年团员书，号召广大青年团结灾区人民，战胜灾荒。宿县、阜阳、安庆等专区于今年一、二月间普遍召开了县、区青年团代表会议及青年代表大会，进一步贯彻生产救灾的方针，使青年团成为生产救灾运动中有组织、有核心、起先锋作用的突击力量。如宿县两羊张村的青年团，在很多灾民准备逃荒的情况下，团员们在共产党和人民政府的号召下，带头组织了八十多户灾民进行捞鱼、挖藕等副业生产，获得不少的成绩，扭转了灾民中的等待救济的思想和悲观情绪。在很多地方，女青年团员们也都积极参加了副业生产与春耕，成为推动和组织广大妇女参加生产的重要力量。灵璧县大赵村的男人大部出去修河堤，女团员魏采容等即带头拉犁。这个办法经该县妇女代表会议的介绍推广，大大地解决了该县春耕中缺乏劳动力与牲畜的困难。在大规模治水修堤中，大批青年团员都发挥了高度的劳动热情，保证了工作的胜利完成。很多青年团员获得了劳动模范或劳动英雄的称号。如在修复望江大堤中，有七十八个团员被评为模范，六十九个团员光荣地加入了中国共产党。淮堤沱西大队评选出的二十二个劳动英雄中，就有十六个是青年团团员。
