　　Who Understands Victory Better Than Them?
　　——Production March of a Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army
    By Our Correspondent　Bai Yuan
    When a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army set out for production, a comrade wrote to his friend on the march: “We are passing through many places where we fought the enemy in the past. Every familiar town and village reminds us of the past battles with the enemy. An unspeakable feeling is inspiring us. I wonder if this is what is called victory?” Yes, those who once fought life-and-death battles with the enemy with their flesh and blood, and who are now using their unstinting labor to build the motherland, no one understands victory better than them. Huang Luqun, a squad leader of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, wrote in his marching diary when they passed a small town railway station: “The railway stations we passed during the war were all messed up, shattered to pieces. The railway station I see today is really beautiful, with a red roof and the ground swept clean. I really don't want to leave after passing here, but then I think, if there is no victory and no production and construction, how can there be such a good place?”
    Squad leader Huang Luqun is right, the people's victory is inspiring them, and the construction of the motherland is inspiring them. In the unit where Huang Luqun was, when they were marching for production, it snowed in one place in April, the roads were very difficult to walk, and they had to climb over a mountain. But when they remembered that they had walked this road during the past battles, they immediately became excited, singing and talking, until they finished walking down the snowy slope. When they passed Hunyuan City in Chahar, the soldiers remembered the tall temple they had seen when they marched into Suiyuan in February of the year before last. Now, when they hadn't even entered the city and saw that temple from a distance, they thought of the scene when the people welcomed them here when they marched into Suiyuan the year before last; they also thought of the big flag that the people here gave them when they attacked Taiyuan last year, and later they planted that big flag on the top of Taiyuan City.
    Many moving stories have occurred in the places where the production troops have passed. In Yijiazhai Village, Hunyuan County, when the production troops passed there, they camped in that village that day. Liu Changrui, a soldier in one squad, ran to a house after the troops had assigned the lodging and saw that it was the same house where they had stayed during the past battles. The soldiers told the landlord about their situation when they lived here during the war and cordially inquired about his current living conditions. He told the soldiers about his situation in detail, and finally said: "Now that we have land, to live a good life, we must work hard to produce." He also encouraged the soldiers to go to the production site and successfully complete the production task of the troops, and then come back to live in his house after the production.
    A soldier named Wang Zhan, from Xiaguanzhuang, Wei County, was conscripted into the army by the Kuomintang before his hometown was liberated. He was liberated when Zhangjiakou was liberated. He is very honest and has made rapid progress since joining the People's Liberation Army. Now he is a Communist Party member. This time, the troops passed through his hometown on their way to production. That day, a comrade in the army accompanied him to his home. The comrade who accompanied him home told his family in detail about Wang Zhan's study, work, and life in the army, and said that Wang Zhan had made rapid progress in the army and is now a very good Communist Party member. His father, mother, and younger brother were overjoyed to hear this. His father was already over fifty years old. When his hometown had not yet been liberated, he was a Communist Party member in the village. Wang Zhan didn't even know that his father was a Communist Party member when he was at home. This time when he returned home, his father told Wang Zhan about his revolutionary work in the village after hearing about Wang Zhan's situation after joining the People's Liberation Army. The father said: Since Wang Zhan was conscripted by the Kuomintang, the Kuomintang bandit army and the evil landlords in the village tied people up and killed people every day. At that time, life at home was very difficult, and he didn't have time to take care of the family because he was doing revolutionary work. Later, the hometown was liberated, and the land was reformed, and the family was allocated land again. Wang Zhan voluntarily joined the People's Liberation Army and became a Communist Party member, and the whole family felt great glory. Finally, he earnestly told Wang Zhan not to miss home, to work hard with his comrades in production, and to study hard. When he left, his father sent Wang Zhan and his comrade out of the house, and the three of them talked all the way about the production situation in the village and the production situation in the army for more than a mile.
    In every town and village that the production troops passed through, there was a deafening sound of gongs and drums. The people came out to greet them from afar. In order not to delay the production of the people, the troops tried not to let the people know in advance where the troops were passing through, to avoid them delaying spring plowing because of welcoming the troops. But despite this, the people still found out in advance where the troops going to the production site were going to pass. There was a village called Jiazhuang. Because they didn't know in advance when the troops would arrive, they didn't have time to welcome them when the troops arrived. When the troops left their village the next day, they beat gongs and drums and shouted slogans to send the troops out of the village, sending them for more than ten miles. In many places, when the troops left, the farmers carried hoes behind the troops, shouting slogans while sending the troops, and then went to their fields to produce. Thus, the vast fields and all the towns and villages boiled up a surging wave of production. It makes people see that the Chinese people, who have won victory for the first time in thousands of years, are also understanding for the first time today how to consolidate victory.

　　谁比他们更懂得胜利？
　　——人民解放军某部生产进军记
    本报记者　白原
    在人民解放军某部出发生产的时候，一位同志在行军途中写给他的朋友的信里说：“我们走过许多过去我们与敌人作战时所走过的地方，每一个熟悉的城镇和乡村，都使我们记起了过去与敌人作战时的情景，有一种说不出的感情在鼓舞着我们。我不知道这是不是就叫做胜利？”是的，过去曾经以血肉去和敌人进行过生死的搏斗，而现在又以他们的毫不吝惜的劳动去进行祖国的建设的人，没有谁比他们更懂得胜利。人民解放军某部的一位班长黄录群，当他们行军路过一个小镇火车站的时候，在他的行军日记里写道：“过去在打仗时所路过的火车站都是乱七八糟，打得稀巴烂。今天看见的这个火车站实在漂亮，红色的屋顶，地上扫得光溜溜的。经过这里，真不想走，但是又一想，如果没有胜利，不去进行生产建设，怎么会有这样的好地方呢？”
    班长黄录群说得不错，人民的胜利在鼓舞着他们，祖国的建设在鼓舞着他们。就在黄录群所在的那个部队，当他们行军去进行生产的时候，有一个地方四月里还下着雪，道路很不好走，而且还要爬过一个山头。但是当他们记起这一条路，曾经在过去作战的时候走过，他们立刻就兴奋起来，又唱又说，一直到走完了那个下雪的山坡。当他们路过察哈尔浑源城的时候，战士们记起前年二月进军绥远时曾经看见过的那一幢高大的寺庙。现在，当他们还没有进城，远远望见那一幢寺庙的时候，他们就想起了前年进军绥远时人民在这里欢迎他们的情景；又想起去年攻打太原的时候，这里的人民给他们献了一面大旗，后来，他们就把那面大旗插到了太原城头。
    在生产的部队所路过的地方，产生了许多动人的故事。在浑源县义家寨村，当生产的部队路过那里的时候，那天即在那个村子里宿营。有一个班的战士刘长瑞，当部队分配好了驻宿的房子以后，跑到那里一看，原来就是他们过去作战时在这里住过的那一家房子。战士们将他们过去打仗时住在这里的情形告诉这位房东，并亲切的探问他现在生活的情况。他把他的情形向战士们详详细细的说了一番，最后他说：“现在地也有了，要过好日子，就是要好好加劲生产了。”他并且还勉励战士们开往生产地点，胜利完成部队的生产任务，等生产回来再来住他的房子。
    有个战士叫王占，蔚县下官庄人，在他家乡没有解放以前，被国民党抓去当了兵，张家口解放的时候才解放过来，人很老实，参加解放军以后进步很快，现在已经是个共产党员了。这次部队去生产路过他的家乡。那天部队里的一位同志陪他一同到了他的家里。陪他一同到家的同志把王占在部队里学习、工作，以及生活的情形详详细细的告诉了他家里，并说王占在部队里进步很快，现在成了一位很好的共产党员。他父亲、母亲、弟弟听了欢天喜地。他父亲已经五十多岁，当家乡还没有解放的时候，他就是村里的共产党员。王占在家的时候，也不知道父亲就是个共产党员。这次回家，父亲听到了王占到了解放军以后的情形，才把他在村里做革命工作的事情告诉王占。父亲说：自从王占被国民党抓去以后，国民党匪军和恶霸地主在村里天天绑人、杀人。那时候家里生活很苦，自己因为做革命工作，又没有时间多照顾家庭。后来家乡解放了，土地改革，家里又分到了地。王占自动参加了解放军，并且成了共产党员，一家人都感到莫大的光荣。最后他殷殷叮嘱王占千万不要想家，和同志们在一起好好生产，好好学习。临走的时候，父亲送王占他们出了家门，三个人一路谈着村里生产的情形，谈着部队生产的情形，一直谈了一里多地。
    在生产的部队所经过的每一个城镇，每一个乡村，锣鼓喧天。人民远远地就出来迎接他们。因为怕耽误老百姓的生产，在部队所路过的地方，都想法不使老百姓预先知道，避免他们因欢迎部队而耽误春耕。但是尽管如此，老百姓还是预先就打听到开往生产地点的部队所要路过的地方。有一个村子叫吉家庄，因为预先不知道部队那天开到，那天部队到他们那里的时候来不及欢迎。等第二天部队离开他们村子的时候，他们就打着锣鼓，喊着口号把部队送出村外，一直送了十多里地。许多地方当部队离开的时候，农民们就扛着锄头跟在部队的后面，一边喊着口号送着部队，一边就走向自己的田地去生产。于是广大的田野和所有的村镇都沸腾起一片生产的汹涌的浪潮。它使人们看见，几千年来，第一次获得了胜利的中国人民，今天也是第一次懂得了如何去巩固胜利。
