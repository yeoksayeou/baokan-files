　　Shijiazhuang Railway Hospital Conducts Another Work Inspection
    Continues to Discover Serious Medical Accidents, Responsible Personnel Have Received Due Punishment

    The Shijiazhuang Railway Hospital of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, after discovering many careless and irresponsible medical accidents during its work inspection this year (published in the People's Garden on April 5th), conducted a special inspection of medical accidents. After everyone's inspection, it continued to reveal more serious medical accidents: On the night of March 13th, nurse Si Minglan, while applying a hot compress (using a hot water bag) to a hospitalized patient, carelessly burned the skin on the patient's inner right thigh, etc., due to her negligence. It was only discovered at dawn. Although treated, the patient eventually died due to the severity of their illness and the added stimulation. Obstetric patient Deng Yichang, four days postpartum, had not had a bowel movement. At 7:00 PM on April 8th, the doctor ordered nursing students Jiang Donglu and Jin Liping to go to the ward to administer an enema. During the enema, they inserted the tube into the wrong place (into the vagina). After the doctor re-treated the patient, the enema finally worked. In addition, the department's doctor, due to a lack of concern for the parturient, inadequate preparation before delivery, and procrastination, caused the patient to give birth to the child outside the delivery room. When performing surgery on a hemorrhoid patient, a surgeon in the surgical department did not perform a systemic examination beforehand, was not careful during the surgery, and did not inspect carefully afterward. The next day, the patient had a major hemorrhage. Only then did he discover that the patient had another blood disease and that the sutures were not properly closed during the surgery. Another operation wasted a lot of time and medicine to save the patient. On a prescription, dental assistant Mao Tieshan copied the prescription incorrectly for Doctor Xie Yunlan on March 24th. Fortunately, Comrade Feng Chong of the pharmacy noticed it, otherwise, the excessive dosage would have endangered the patient's life (because it was an anesthetic). Dispenser Lu Peiyu mistakenly used "morphine" as "codeine" when dispensing medicine. Nursing student Gao Deyuan miscalculated the dosage of a hypnotic drug (all of the above were discovered and corrected).

    After the hospital's inspection work ended, the railway bureau gave due punishment to those whose mistakes were serious: 1. Doctor Zhao Zhong misused drugs, endangering human life, and has been sent to the Shijiazhuang Municipal Court for handling. 2. Nurse Rong Aizhi was negligent in her work, misused the dosage, and almost harmed human life, and was given a demerit. 3. Nurse Si Minglan was careless in her nursing work, causing the patient to die from stimulation, fully demonstrating an irresponsible attitude towards the patient, and was given a notice of dismissal. 4. Other personnel were also given warnings and criticisms.

    The main reasons for the repeated occurrence of the above accidents: 1. Leading cadres have bureaucracy and ideological paralysis. For example, there are disunity phenomena in the laboratory and pharmacy, and some staff members look down on each other and engage in individual heroism, thus hindering the work; and the leading cadres have not solved this problem in time, so that one mistake leads to another. 2. Some personnel lack a sense of responsibility for patients, are careless, and perfunctorily perform their duties. 3. The system lacks organization and discipline, and the division of labor is unclear. For example, before each department performs surgery, it is originally required to report to the medical office, which will make a decision after examination and research; however, the departments report only after the surgery has been performed, resulting in the danger of massive hemorrhage for the hemorrhoid patient.

### 石市铁路医院再度进行工作检查  继续发现严重医疗事故  错误人员已得应有处分

　　石市铁路医院再度进行工作检查
    继续发现严重医疗事故  错误人员已得应有处分
    太原铁路局石家庄铁路医院，在本年工作检查中发现了不少粗枝大叶、不负责任的医疗事故后（已刊于四月五日人民园地），进行了医疗事故的专门检查。经过大家检查，继续揭发出较严重的医疗事故有：三月十三日夜护士司茗兰，在给住院患者做敷热时（放暖水袋），因粗心大意，将一个病势沉重的病人的右股内侧等处的皮肤烫伤，致天明时才发现，虽经医治，但终因病势沉重，再经此刺激，终于死亡。产妇科住院产妇邓宜昌，产后四天未大便，四月八日下午七时医生叫看护生姜东禄、靳丽萍，到病房去灌肠通便，去灌肠时灌错位置（把管嘴插入阴道内），经大夫重行疏治，灌肠后始通便。另外，该科大夫由于对产妇不关心，分娩前检查准备不足，拖延时间，使产妇把小孩生在产房外边。外科大夫在给一痔核患者行手术时，事前不做全身性检查，手术不细心，事后也未很好检查，次日患者即大出血。之后，他才发现患者另有血液病，施手术时合缝处不良，再动手术浪费了不少时间和药品才挽救了病人。在处方上，牙科助理医生毛铁山三月二十四日，给解云岚大夫抄方时，抄错了药方，幸经药房冯崇同志发觉，否则便要因用量过度，危害人命了（因系麻醉药）。调剂员卢佩玉配药时，误将“吗啡”当做“可待因”使用。护生高德元将催眠药量配错（以上均经发觉予以纠正）。
    该院检查工作告结束后，对错误严重的人员由路局予以应得的处分：一、医生赵钟错用药品，危害人命，已送石市法院处理。二、护士荣爱芝对工作疏忽，错用药量，险伤人命，给予记过一次处分。三、护士司茗兰在护理工作中粗心大意，致使患者遭受刺激而死亡，十足表现了对患者不负责的态度，给予通令开除处分。四、其他人员亦都分别给以警告、批评处分。
    屡次发生以上事故的主要原因：一、领导干部存在着官僚主义与思想麻痹。如化验室及药房都存在着不团结现象，某些工作人员间互相看不起，闹个人英雄主义，因而妨碍工作；而领导干部对此问题亦未及时解决，以致一错再错。二、部分人员缺乏对病人负责的精神，粗枝大叶，应付了事。三、制度上无组织无纪律，分工不明确。如各科在作手术前一日，原须报告医务室，经检查研究后始作决定；但各科室却在手术进行后才报告，以致酿成痔核患者大出血的危险。
