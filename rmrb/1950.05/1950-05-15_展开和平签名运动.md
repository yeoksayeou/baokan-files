　　Launch the Peace Signature Campaign
    The signature campaign by all good people on the appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress is vigorously unfolding in all regions of the world. Cities in China such as Shanghai have already launched this signature campaign since May 1st, and Beijing also launched a large-scale signature campaign on May 13th. To support world peace and oppose the use of atomic weapons is the common will of all the Chinese people. Let us tell the world the will of hundreds of millions of people!
    Those who oppose world peace and actively prepare for war are only the imperialist elements headed by US imperialism and the warmongers. They only account for a very small number of all mankind. But this small group of dangerous elements still controls the political power of some countries, and they still have certain military and economic strength, and they are still deceiving a part of the masses. They threaten peace. The people of the world must unite as one in the world anti-imperialist camp led by the powerful Soviet Union, and actively wage a resolute struggle against this small group of bloody imperialist war vendors, in order to defend peace and repel the danger of a new war.
    The peace signature campaign is a general review of the forces of peace-loving people all over the world, and also a major demonstration against the warmongers. This is a political action of peace-loving people all over the world, so the number of people signing in various countries is increasing by leaps and bounds. International organizations such as the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, and the World Federation of Democratic Youth, representing tens of millions of working people, women, and youth, have announced their participation in the appeal of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress. In the Soviet Union, Pravda called on the world to expand the signature campaign, emphasizing that in the struggle for peace, it is necessary to develop a mass movement to ban atomic weapons. In Democratic Germany, the number of signatures in three regions reached 10 million. The Hungarian peace signature campaign was successfully completed, with more than 7 million participants, accounting for 80% of the country's population. Almost all adults in Bulgaria signed. The situation of participation in signing in Poland and Czechoslovakia is very enthusiastic. According to preliminary statistics, more than 3 million people in North Korea have signed for peace. People in countries such as France, Italy, Britain, the Netherlands, Australia, the United States, Japan, and India have held peace conferences and peace referendums one after another. The peace signature campaign in Western European countries is combined with the struggle against US imperialist military aid and for national independence and democratic freedom. The peace movement of the vast people in the eastern colonial and semi-colonial countries is closely linked with the national liberation struggle.
    We Chinese people have already made a great contribution to the world peace movement with our victorious revolutionary war. Our revolutionary war was to oppose the war provocateur US imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang. The victory of our revolutionary war greatly weakened the forces of imperialist war mongers. In order to show the infinite loyalty of our vast masses to the cause of world peace, and to show our firm will to oppose a new war, we should make the peace signature campaign universally unfold in factories, universally unfold in the countryside, universally unfold in the army, in schools, and among all peace-loving people!
    Strive to get hundreds of millions of Chinese people to participate in the peace signature, and let the warmongers tremble in the face of our signature ranks!

　　展开和平签名运动
    一切善良的人们在世界拥护和平大会常设委员会呼吁书上的签名运动，正在全世界各个地区热烈地展开。中国的上海等城市已经从五月一日起展开这个签名运动，北京也在五月十三日展开大规模的签名运动了。拥护世界和平，反对使用原子武器，是全中国人民的共同意志。让我们把几万万人的意志告诉全世界吧！
    反对世界和平，积极准备战争的，只有以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义分子、战争挑拨者们，他们只占全人类的极少数。但是这一小群危险分子还掌握着一些国家的政权，他们还有一定的军事和经济力量，还欺骗着一部分的群众。他们威胁着和平。全世界人民必须一致团结在以强大的苏联为领导的世界反帝国主义阵营中，积极向这一小群血腥的帝国主义战争贩子作坚决的斗争，才能够保卫和平，才能够打退新战争的危险。
    和平签名运动就是全世界爱好和平的人民力量的总检阅，也是对于战争贩子们的大示威。这是全世界爱好和平的人民的政治性行动，所以各国签名的人数正飞跃地增加着。世界工联、国际民主妇职和世界民主青联等国际组织，代表千千万万劳动人民、妇女和青年宣布参加和大常委会这一呼吁。在苏联，真理报号召全世界扩大签名运动，着重指出，在争取和平斗争中，要发展禁止原子武器的群众运动。民主德国的三个地区签名人数达一千万。匈牙利和平签名胜利完成，参加者七百余万，占全国人口百分之八十。保加利亚几乎一切成年人都签了名。波兰、捷克，参加签名的情形，都很热烈。北朝鲜各地的和平签名据初步统计，已在三百余万人以上。法、意、英、荷、澳、美、日、印等国人民，纷纷举行保卫和平大会，举行和平总投票。西欧各国的和平签名运动和反对美帝军援、争取民族独立和民主自由的斗争相结合。而东方殖民地与半殖民地国家中广大人民的和平运动与民族解放斗争密切地联系着。
    我们中国人民已经以胜利的革命战争对于世界和平运动作了伟大的贡献。我们的革命战争是为了反对战争挑拔者美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮，我们的革命战争的胜利大大削弱了帝国主义好战分子的力量。为了表现我们广大人民群众对于世界和平事业的无限忠心，表现我们反对新战争的坚强意志，我们应当使和平签名运动在工厂中普遍展开，在农村中普遍展开，在部队中、在学校中、在一切爱好和平的人们中间普遍展开！
    争取几万万的中国人参加和平签名，让战争贩子们在我们签名的行列面前发抖！
