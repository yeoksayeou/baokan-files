　　[Beijing News Agency] Private Hengdecheng Weaving Factory in Beijing, through consultation between labor and management, workers have taken practical actions such as increasing production, lowering piece-rate wages, and improving product quality to help the management overcome current temporary difficulties and enhance the management's confidence in business. The factory is a larger electric weaving factory in Beijing. Due to difficulties in capital turnover, the management openly presented accounts to the workers last month and proposed lowering wages. After the workers calculated the costs and understood that the factory did have difficulties, they agreed to lower wages, but at the same time pointed out that this was not the only way to solve the business difficulties. It is necessary to fundamentally solve the problem by increasing production, reducing costs, and improving quality. After two general meetings and several representative meetings between labor and management, the workers were willing to do their best to overcome technical difficulties. Since April 17, they have increased labor productivity, changing from one worker watching one electric loom to watching two looms. A part of the surplus labor force was added to the night shift, so the total output in April reached 678 bolts, an increase of 38% compared to March; the plan for May is to increase production to 820 bolts, which will be an increase of 62% compared to March. The output of the thread winders has also greatly increased, with each person winding 86 pieces of weft thread per month, up from 65 pieces, and 76 pieces of warp thread, up from 58 pieces. In terms of quality, the thread winders guarantee not to wind "blind spindles" to reduce waste thread, and guarantee not to "wait for spindles" to avoid the weaving workers having to stop the machines to wait for materials; the weaving workers guarantee excellent cloth quality and use the wisdom of the working class to transform the cloth winding gear, which can weave more than 88 weft threads, suitable for processing "23 cloth" for the printed calico company, thus reducing the rate of rejected cloth and substandard cloth. Regarding the wage issue, the original wage for weaving "23 cloth" was nine catties of millet per bolt, without implementing a progressive system. Each person could weave 21 bolts per month on one machine, with a wage of 189 catties of millet. Now, after changing to watching two machines and increasing productivity, a seven-level progressive system is implemented. Each person can generally weave 42 bolts per month, with a wage of 252 catties of millet. Although the average wage per bolt is six catties of millet, a decrease of one-third compared to the original, reducing the piece-rate wage rate, but due to the increase in production, not only has the management's total profit increased significantly, but the workers' total monthly wages have also increased compared to before. In addition, the workers proposed that there are too many staff members and they should be streamlined. As a result of the agreement, five people have joined direct production work such as weaving and sizing thread. The management of the factory, seeing these practical actions of the workers to actively overcome difficulties, has also increased their confidence. He said: "Doing so will not only allow the factory to stand firm, but also to develop. After the purchasing power of farmers increases, the weaving and dyeing industry will have a more promising future." Now 14 more workers have been added, and preparations are being made to continue adding workers to fully open the night shift for all 32 electric looms. At the same time, both labor and management of the factory have recognized the necessity of having an organized consultation mechanism to regularly solve problems of improving business and labor-management relations. Now each has put forward three representatives, and a labor-management consultation meeting will be formally established soon.

　　私营恒德成织布厂
　　劳资协商后生产上升           
　　四月份产量较三月增三分之一强
    【京市新闻处讯】京市私营恒德成织布厂经劳资双方协商，工人以增加产量、降低按件工资率、提高产品质量等实际行动，协助资方克服目前暂时困难，增强了资方经营信心。该厂为京市较大电力织布工厂，资方因资金周转困难，于上月间向工人公开帐目提出降低工资问题，经工人核算成本，了解工厂确有困难后，同意降低工资，但同时指出，这不是唯一解决经营困难的办法，必须依靠增加产量、降低成本、提高质量才能根本解决。劳资间经过两次大会和几次代表会协商，工人愿竭力克服技术上的困难，自四月十七日起提高劳动生产率，织布由原来每人看一台电力机改看两台，并将腾出的富余劳动力增加一部分夜班，因之总产量四月份达到六百七十八匹，比三月份增加百分之三十八；五月份计划增产到八百二十匹，将比三月份增加百分之六十二。打线工人的产量也大为增加，每人每月打纬线由六十五块提高到八十六块，打经线由每人每月五十八块提高到七十六块。质量方面，打线工人保证不打“瞎轴”减少残线，保证不“等轴”，避免织布工人停机待料；织布工人则保证布质优良，并发挥工人阶级智慧，改造卷布牙轮，能织纬线八十八根以上，适合给花纱布公司加工织“二三布”的规格，因而退布率和次布率减少。关于工资问题，原来织“二三布”每匹工资九斤小米，不实行累进制，看一台机每人每月可织到二十一匹，工资一百八十九斤小米，现改看两台机、生产率提高后，实行七级累进制，每人每月一般可织到四十二匹，工资是二百五十二斤小米，虽然平均每匹工资六斤小米，比原来降低三分之一，减低了按件工资率，但由于增大了生产额，不只资方利润总额增加许多，工人全月工资也较前提高。此外，工人们提出职员太多应该精简，协议结果，已有五名参加织布、浆线等直接生产工作。该厂资方目睹工人们这些积极克服困难的实际行动，信心也因之提高了，他说：“这样做，不单厂子能站稳了，而且还能发展，农民购买力提高以后，织染业将有更远大前途”。现在又增添了十四名工人，准备继续增加工人，把三十二台电力机全部增开夜班。同时，该厂劳资双方已认识有组织协商机构，以经常解决改进业务和劳资关系问题的必要，现已各推出代表三人，即将正式成立劳资协商会议。
