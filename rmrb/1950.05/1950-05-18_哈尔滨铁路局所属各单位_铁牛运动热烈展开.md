　　[This report from] Harbin (By our correspondent) Since the Harbin Railway Bureau and its affiliated units fully launched the Iron Ox Movement in October of last year, work efficiency has significantly improved, accidents have greatly decreased, and costs have been reduced compared to the past. The bureau has successfully completed its transportation tasks and saved a huge amount of expenses for the country. As of the end of March, the bureau had 146 Iron Ox locomotives, and the inspection, rolling stock, engineering, and electrical units had cultivated a total of 67 Iron Ox teams. Fifty-eight locomotives have achieved over 100,000 kilometers of safe operation. Locomotive No. 593 of the Sankeshu Locomotive Depot has reached over 194,000 kilometers without any accidents. The Linkou Locomotive Depot has even set a record of one million kilometers without accidents. Thanks to the leadership of the old Iron Ox Locomotive No. 96, the locomotives under the bureau pulled an additional 499,979 tons in two months, overcoming the difficulty of insufficient locomotives and ensuring the completion of transportation tasks. Calculated according to the traction standard of the Harbin-Changchun line, a total of 277 locomotives were saved, saving expenses of 7.988 billion yuan (Northeast currency). The Sankeshu Electrical Section implemented a production system of "layered repair responsibility, step-by-step contract signing," which greatly improved work efficiency, and was awarded the title of Model Electrical Section of Northeast China in February. Mudanjiang Station successfully learned the new Soviet shunting method, reducing the average shunting time per vehicle by one hour per day.
　　The experience of the bureau in launching the Iron Ox Movement proves that repeated publicity and education to get through the masses' thinking is the key to launching the movement. "Seizing red flags" and "fighting on the arena" are good ways to carry out the movement. This approach can not only exchange experiences with each other, but also stimulate the enthusiasm of trade union cadres at all levels, cultivate typical examples and set up banners, which are indispensable conditions for carrying out the movement. In December of last year, there were many delays and accidents in the Harbin Locomotive Depot, and some people mistakenly believed that more traction was impossible in winter and asked the bureau to reduce the axle load. The bureau transferred the old Iron Ox Locomotive No. 96 to the Harbin-Changchun line for demonstration, and soon created an example of over-axle operation and on-time arrival. Iron Ox locomotives in various places successively launched an over-axle movement, and the winter transportation task was successfully completed. The experience of the Harbin Railway Bureau's Iron Ox Movement proves that the implementation of democratic management is the basic link for promoting the enthusiasm and creativity of the working class. Convening workers' representative conferences and carrying out rationalization proposal movements are the best organizational forms to give play to the workers' wisdom and enthusiasm. For example, at the beginning of the winter transportation, the locomotive parking time in the depot required 17 to 22 minutes. At the workers' representative conference, the workers put forward rationalization proposals, which were adopted by the administration. The locomotive parking time was quickly shortened to 13 minutes. The Jiamusi Inspection and Repair Depot has done a good job in carrying out rationalization proposals, achieving great results in saving materials, shortening working hours, improving quality, and reducing costs, which has promoted the enthusiastic development of the Iron Ox Movement.

　　哈尔滨铁路局所属各单位
　　铁牛运动热烈展开
    【本报哈尔滨讯】哈尔滨铁路管理局所属各单位自去年十月全面开展铁牛运动以来，工作效率显著提高，事故大为减少，成本较前降低。该局已胜利完成运输任务，并替国家节省了巨额开支。截至三月底止，该局已出现铁牛机车一四六台，检、车、工、电各单位共培养了六十七个铁牛组。安全行走十万公里以上的机车出现五十八台。三棵树机务段五九三号机车，达到十九万四千余公里无事故。林口机务段更创造了百万公里无事故的最高纪录。由于老铁牛九六号机车的带头，该局所属机车在二个月中，多牵引四十九万九千九百七十九吨，克服了机车不足的困难，保证完成运输任务。按照哈长线牵引标准计算，共节省二百七十七台机车，节省经费七十九亿八千余万元（东北币）。三棵树电务段实行了“层层包修制，步步订合同”的生产制度，工作效率大为提高，二月中获得全东北模范电务段的称号。牡丹江车站学习苏联新调车法成功，每辆车每天调度时间平均缩短一小时。
    该局开展铁牛运动的经验证明，反复进行宣传教育，打通群众思想，是开展运动的关键。“夺红旗”、“打擂”，都是开展运动的较好方式。这种方式，既可互相交流经验，又能刺激各级工会干部的积极性，培养典型树立旗帜，更是开展运动不可缺少的条件。去年十二月份，哈尔滨机务段运缓事故很多，有些人误认为冬季不能多牵引，要求局方减轴。路局将老铁牛九六号机车调到哈长线示范，很快创造了超轴正点的范例，各地铁牛机车相继掀起超轴运动，冬运任务即胜利完成。哈尔滨局铁牛运动的经验证明：实行民主管理，是发扬工人阶级的积极性和创造性的基本环节。召开工代会和开展合理化建议运动，是发挥工人智慧和积极性的最好的组织形式。如冬运开始时，机车停库时间需十七到二十二分钟，在工代会上，工人提出了合理化建议，行政上采纳了。机车停库时间迅即缩短为十三分钟。佳木斯检车段合理化建议开展得好，在节省材料、缩短工时、提高质量、减低成本上收到很大功效，促使铁牛运动火热的开展起来。
