(1) Reply Telegram from the All-China "June 1st" International Children's Day Preparatory Committee Responding to the Call to Defend Children's Rights from the International Children's Day and International Conference for the Defence of Children Preparatory Committee
Dear friends:

We are organized by eleven people's organizations of the People's Republic of China and the relevant children's work departments of the Central People's Government. On behalf of all sectors of society and parents in our country who care about the happiness of children, we support your call to protect children's rights and strive for peace. Our Central People's Government has announced that June 1st, International Children's Day, will be the Chinese children's own holiday, and a holiday will be given to hold celebrations.

In the old China ruled by the reactionary clique in the past, children were not valued by society, most had no opportunity to receive education; most lacked nutrition, resulting in poor development; and many children were reduced to beggars.

Now, the Chinese people's revolution has been victorious. The rights that children should have are now protected by the new China. Children's lives have improved compared to the past.

However, the Kuomintang reactionary armed forces have not been completely eliminated, and we must continue to work hard to liberate Taiwan and finally completely eliminate the armed forces of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. Moreover, the various obstacles left over from the old China cannot be completely eliminated in a short period of time. To enable every Chinese child to have a happy life, we must also restore the wounds of war and enable further economic development to achieve this; but we will definitely be able to achieve it step by step.

June 1st this year is the first International Children's Day. We are preparing to launch a nationwide review of the achievements and shortcomings of children's work on this day, promote the cause of protecting children's rights, and work hand in hand with parents and all those who care about the happiness of children in all countries for the safety of children, oppose the war conspiracy of imperialism, and strive for lasting world peace.

(2) Notice from the All-China "June 1st" International Children's Day Preparatory Committee for Celebrating International Children's Day

We call on all sectors of society and parents across the country who care about the happiness of children to respond to the appeal of the International Children's Day Preparatory Committee, composed of six major democratic organizations including the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Women's International Democratic Federation, the World Federation of Democratic Youth, the International Union of Students, the International Association of Democratic Journalists, and the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, to protect children's rights and strive for peace. The local democratic women's federations, youth leagues, youth federations, and trade unions should initiate and invite relevant organizations to form local joint institutions to jointly prepare for the commemoration of "June 1st" International Children's Day. We are now forwarding to you our reply to the International Conference for the Defence of Children Preparatory Committee telegram for your reference.

On "June 1st" International Children's Day, we suggest that celebrations be held in various regions, and we suggest the following four specific measures:

(1) Widely publicize the provisions for the protection of children in the Common Program, arouse the attention of all sectors of society across the country, and properly protect and educate children; correct the old society's habits of corporal punishment and beating children; pay attention to improving children's health and wisdom; cultivate good children of the new democratic China; and inspire children's internationalist ideas and enhance friendship between Chinese children and children from all over the world.

(2) In general large and medium-sized cities, children's celebrations should be held by district, in small cities the celebrations should be held by the entire city as appropriate, and in rural areas the celebrations should be held by primary school or village. At the meeting, local government and People's Liberation Army leaders, labor heroes, model workers, scientists, writers, etc. can be invited to meet with the children and hold various recreational performances to make the celebration a relaxed, happy, and meaningful meeting; however, the meeting time should not exceed two hours.

(3) On June 1st, people's organizations in various regions can do their best to contact cinemas to show children's films for free or at reduced prices to entertain children. Please open parks, amusement parks, and children's libraries to children, and ask bookstores to sell children's books and donate books to children's libraries and relief agencies at low prices. Before and after "June 1st," mobilize medical workers to give children physical examinations, mobilize literary and art workers to compile and print children's stories, newspapers, songs, and dramas, and publish children's supplements in newspapers and magazines. Hold children's life photo exhibitions, etc. when possible.

(4) Urge respected people in society to sign the call for the protection of children and send it to our association for forwarding to the International Preparatory Committee.

In addition to the above methods, please submit any suggestions you have to our association at any time; and we hope that you will report the situation of celebrating Children's Day in various regions to our association in mid-June.

    响应保卫儿童权利的呼吁  号召各地庆祝国际儿童节
    【新华社二日讯】为了筹备庆祝“六一”国际儿童节及响应国际民主妇联等团体发出的保卫儿童权利的呼吁书，中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国总工会、中国新民主主义青年团中央委员会、中华全国民主青年联合总会、中华全国学生联合会、中华全国文学艺术界联合会、中华全国教育工作者代表会议筹备委员会、中华全国第一次自然科学工作者代表大会筹备委员会、中华全国新闻工作者协会筹备会、中国社会科学各研究会联合办事处、中国人民救济代表会议筹备会，及中央人民政府卫生部、教育部、文化部等十四单位代表，曾于日前集会，共同组成中华全国“六一”国际儿童节筹备委员会。会议由全国妇联儿童福利部部长康克清主持。会议热烈讨论了如何纪念“六一”国际儿童节的各项筹备事宜，确定以全国妇联、全国青联、全国总工会、中央人民政府卫生部、教育部等五个单位组成常委会进行筹备工作。筹委会顷决定发出响应国际儿童节和国际保卫儿童会议筹备委员会呼吁保卫儿童权利的复电及庆祝国际儿童节的联合通知。这两个文件的全文如下：
    （一）中华全国“六一”国际儿童节筹备委员会响应呼吁保卫儿童权利的复电国际儿童节和国际保卫儿童会议筹备委员会亲爱的朋友们：
    我们是由中华人民共和国的十一个人民团体和中央人民政府的有关儿童工作部门组织而成。谨代表我国一切关心儿童幸福的各界人士和父母们，拥护你们保卫儿童权利、争取和平的呼吁。我们的中央人民政府已宣布以六月一日国际儿童节，作为中国儿童自己的节日，并放假举行庆祝。
    在过去反动派统治的旧中国，儿童不受社会重视，大半没有受教育的机会；多数缺乏营养，以至发育不好；还有不少儿童沦为乞丐。
    现在，中国人民革命已经胜利。儿童应有的权利已经受到新中国保护。儿童的生活已较前改善。
    但是，国民党反动武装还没有完全消灭，我们还要努力解放台湾，最后彻底消灭蒋匪的武装。而且旧中国所遗留的各种阻难，更非短时期所能肃清。要使每一个中国儿童都得到幸福生活，我们还必须恢复战争的创伤，使经济能有进一步的发展，才能达到；但我们必能逐步地达到。
    今年六月一日是第一个国际儿童节。我们准备在这一天发动全国各界检阅儿童工作的成绩和缺点，推进保卫儿童权利的事业，并为儿童的安全，与各国的父母和一切关心儿童幸福的人们携手，反对帝国主义的战争阴谋，争取世界的持久和平。

    中华人民共和国中央人民政府文化部
    （二）中华全国“六一”国际儿童节筹备委员会为庆祝国际儿童节的通知
    我们号召全国一切关怀儿童幸福的各界人士和父母们，响应以世界工会联合会、国际民主妇女联合会、世界民主青年联盟、国际民主学生联合会、国际新闻记者协会、国际民主法律工作者协会等六大民主团体组成的国际儿童节筹备委员会的保卫儿童权利、争取和平的呼吁书，并以全国各地方的民主妇联、青年团、青联、工会来发起，邀请有关团体组织各地方的联合机构，共同筹备纪念“六一”国际儿童节。现将我们答复国际保卫儿童会议筹备委员会电报转给你们，请你们参考。
    在“六一”国际儿童节的日子，我们建议在各地举行庆祝，并建议以下四项具体办法：
    （一）广泛宣传共同纲领中保护儿童的规定，唤起全国各界人士注意，要好好保护与教育儿童；纠正旧社会对儿童体罚和打骂孩子的习惯；注意增进儿童的健康和智慧；培养新民主主义中国的好儿童；并启发儿童的国际主义思想，增进中国与世界各国儿童间的友谊。
    （二）一般的大中城市以区为单位、小城市酌量以全市为单位、农村则以小学或村为单位举行儿童庆祝会。在会上可请当地政府和解放军的负责人、劳动英雄、劳动模范、科学家、作家等出席与儿童见面，并举行各种游艺表演，使庆祝会成为轻松愉快而有意义的大会；但开会的时间不得超过两小时。
    （三）在六月一日，各地人民团体可尽力接洽电影院免费或减价放映儿童影片招待儿童。请公园、游艺场、儿童图书馆等为儿童开放，请书店廉价出售儿童图书书籍，发动捐书给儿童图书馆和救济机关。在“六一”前后，动员医务工作者给儿童检查身体，动员文学艺术工作者编印儿童故事、书报、歌曲和戏剧，在报纸杂志上出儿童副刊。可能时举行儿童生活照片展览会等。
    （四）敦促社会上有声望的人在响应保卫儿童的呼吁书上签名，然后寄交本会转国际筹委会。
    除上述办法外，各地有何建议，请随时向本会提出；并望将各地庆祝儿童节的情况于六月中旬报告本会。
