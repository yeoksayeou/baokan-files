Yutian Quad District Cadres Steal Disaster Relief Clothes
　　Should be Sanctioned by Law
　　On April 7th, the Civil Affairs Section of Yutian Quad District retrieved 1200 pieces of clothing for disaster victims from the county government. Some comrades in the district, seeing that some of the clothes were very good, secretly stole them, or exchanged their old clothes for new ones. This selfish behavior seriously infringed upon the interests of the masses. On the evening of April 9th, Zheng Yunfang, the secretary of the district office, and Yang Lianshan, a messenger, and two others stole the clothes under the guise of sorting them. Ma Baiyi, the work team leader, not only did not stop this behavior, but also took a pair of underpants for himself. On the morning of the 10th, Deputy District Chief Yu Deqian and eight others rushed into the warehouse, grabbing and picking at random, and took away a lot of clothes.
　　After Comrade Cui Zhikai, the secretary of the district party committee, discovered this matter, he immediately convened a meeting of the district party committee and decided that all departments should guarantee the return of the clothes. However, so far only five comrades have returned a total of twenty pieces. Yang Shishan, Ren Huiwen, and Cui Zhensheng not only did not return the clothes, but also did not honestly confess how many pieces they had taken. The investigation revealed that the whereabouts of fourteen pieces are unknown.
　　After this incident occurred, the County Party Committee attached great importance to it and has instructed the District Party Committee to not only guarantee the recovery of all the clothes, but also to conduct a thorough self-criticism.

　　玉田四区干部窃取救灾衣服
　　应受法律制裁
    四月七日，玉田四区民政科从县府领回救济灾民衣服一千二百件。该区有部分同志见有的衣服很好，便私自窃取，或以自己旧的去换新的，这种自私自利的行为，严重的侵犯了群众的利益。四月九日晚，区公所秘书郑云芳和交通员杨连山等三人，以整理衣服为名，进行窃取；工作队长马柏义对此问题不但不加制止，自已也拿了一条裤衩。十日早晨，副区长于德谦等九人，竟一拥而入库房，乱抓乱挑，把衣服弄走了不少。
    区委书记崔志开同志发觉此事后虽曾立即召开区委会议，决定各部门保证将衣服退回。但至今只有五个同志共退回二十件。而杨士山、仁惠文、崔振声等不但不退回，反而连拿去件数也不坦白。清查结果：十四件找不到下落。
    此事发生后，县委会极为重视，已指令该区区委除保证将全部衣服追回外，并要进行深刻的检讨。
