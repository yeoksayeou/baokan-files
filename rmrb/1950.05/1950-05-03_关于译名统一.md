On Standardizing Translations
    Li Nong
    Standardizing translations is a technical issue, but a very complex one. The translations in newspapers and magazines now are truly diverse and independent, with even the most common names like Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin not yet unified. "马克思" (Mǎkèsī) is sometimes translated as "马克斯" (Mǎkèsī). "斯大林" (Sīdàlín) appears as "斯达林" (Sīdálín) and "史大林" (Shǐdàlín), each writing as they please.

    To completely unify translations cannot be achieved overnight. But we have a basic requirement: the Xinhua News Agency's dispatches and the Xinhua Bookstore's publications should strive for internal consistency. Currently, one often reads inconsistent translations in newspapers: "朝鲜民主主义人民共和国" (Cháoxiǎn Mínzhǔ Zhǔyì Rénmín Gònghéguó), "朝鲜人民民主共和国" (Cháoxiǎn Rénmín Mínzhǔ Gònghéguó), and "朝鲜民主共和国" (Cháoxiǎn Mínzhǔ Gònghéguó) are used interchangeably. The Hungarian Communist Party is sometimes called "匈牙利工人党" (Xiōngyálì Gōngrén Dǎng), and sometimes "匈牙利劳动人民党" (Xiōngyálì Láodòng Rénmín Dǎng). An even more prominent example: a Xinhua News Agency Beijing dispatch on March 10th stated that the American imperialists sent a "special mission" to Southeast Asia for activities, while the March 19th dispatch stated that an "American economic mission" was active in Saigon, and the March 23rd dispatch stated that an American "economic survey group" arrived in Malaya, the head of which was Griffin. Although many of these inconsistencies are due to the source material, the editors at Xinhua News Agency neither standardize nor explain them. If readers do not carefully deduce, who can tell that these are the same events?

    The Xinhua Bookstore's publications also have many inconsistent translations. The name "李森科" (Lǐsēnkē) [Lysenko] is already widely used, but the recently published "Genetics and its Variations" uses "雷先柯" (Léixiānkē). Even more strange is the inconsistency of translations between two articles within the same magazine. For example, in the "Soviet Philosophy Front" special in the fourth issue of "Sino-Soviet Friendship," the editor mentions "盖德罗夫" (Gàidéluófū) in the editor's note, while the main text features a "凯德洛夫" (Kǎidéluófū), which is actually the same person. In the first volume, eleventh issue of "Literary Gazette," two articles published together both mention the author of "Moscow Character." The first article uses "索佛郎诺夫" (Suǒfó láng nuò fū), while the second uses "沙弗罗诺夫" (Shāfú luónuò fū).

    Foreign names and place names translated into Chinese are already difficult to remember. Adding inconsistent translations only increases the reader's difficulty. It is said that the Government Administration Council's Cultural and Educational Committee is preparing to standardize academic terminology. It is hoped that this work will begin soon and will start with simple and easily manageable tasks.

　　关于译名统一
    李农
    译名统一是个技术的问题，然而是个很复杂的问题。现在书报杂志上的译名，真是五花八门，各自为政，连马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林这几个顶普遍的名字都还没有统一。“马克思”有时译“马克斯”。“斯大林”“斯达林”“史大林”也各写各的。
    要想把译名完全统一，不是一朝一夕可以做到的。但是我们有一个起码的要求，新华社的电稿和新华书店出的书刊应当力求其自身的统一。目前在报纸上经常读到许多不统一的译名：“朝鲜民主主义人民共和国”“朝鲜人民民主共和国”“朝鲜民主共和国”并用。匈牙利的共产党有时叫“匈牙利工人党”，有时又叫“匈牙利劳动人民党”。有一个更突出的例子，新华社北京三月十日电称美帝派“特别使团”来东南亚活动，三月十九日电称“美国经济使团”在西贡活动，三月二十三日电称美国“经济考察团”抵马来亚活动，团长都是葛里芬。虽然这些很多是由于电讯来源本身的不统一，但是新华社的编者既不加以标准化，又不加以说明，读者如果不细心地加以推断，谁能看出这是同一件事？
    新华书店出版的书刊，译名不一致的也很多。“李森科”这个名字已用得很普遍了，但最近出版的一本《遗传及其变异》却用了“雷先柯”。更可异的是同在一本杂志内前后两篇文章译名不统一。例如《中苏友好》一卷四期“在苏联哲学战线”特辑里，编者在按语中提到“盖德罗夫”，后面正文里出现了一个“凯德洛夫”，其实是同一人。《文艺报》第一卷第十一期里有两篇文章连排在一起，都提到《莫斯科性格》的作者，前一篇用“索佛郎诺夫”，后一篇用“沙弗罗诺夫”。
    外国人名地名译成中文原来就不好记，加以译法不统一，更增加了读者的困难。听说政务院文教委员会已经准备进行统一学术名词工作，希望早日开始，并希望先从简单的较易着手的做起。
