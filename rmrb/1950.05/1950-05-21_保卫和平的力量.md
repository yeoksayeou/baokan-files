The words in the signed letter from six soldiers of the 12th Detachment of the Construction Corps are moving: "Although we hold weapons in our hands, we love peace more passionately than anyone else. We support peace, and we are not afraid of war. If the imperialist warmongers dare to provoke war, we will dedicate everything we have to defend peace."

The 282 soldiers of the Communications Department of the Air Force Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army wrote on their signature book: "We will grip the guns in our hands tightly, resolutely defend the motherland, defend the nation, defend the people's airspace, and defend lasting world peace!"

Hu Lisheng, a military dependent from No. 18 Huangchenggen, West Fourth, also attached a letter to Chairman Mao in his peace signature letter, saying, "Our people have been liberated, you truly love the country and the people. We have decided to support you, which is also supporting peace."

The workers of the Continental Photography Studio deeply assessed the power of American imperialism in their signature book, saying that it fears peace and it also fears war! Because more than half of humanity supports world peace, and does not fantasize about peace; opposes wars of aggression, and is not afraid of war! This can build a strong Great Wall of Peace!

The housewives of the three families in Courtyard A, No. 1 Kuanjie Street, Chaoyangmen Inner, not only signed the Great Declaration, but also wrote on behalf of the entire courtyard: "We have always held warm illusions about American imperialism. The newspapers often talk about the crimes of American imperialism, and we found it seemingly true and yet not. However, after reading the Great Declaration and Guo Moruo's speech, we understood: American imperialism became fat by eating human blood in the two World Wars! We do not want to see countless innocent people used as cannon fodder for them!"

832 teachers and students of Nankou Complete Primary School in Changping County participated in the peace signature campaign and unanimously decided that each person should mobilize more than five family members and friends to participate in the signature campaign.

Children are the next generation of New China, and they must build a new world in peace. It is the responsibility of every parent to protect them from the ravages of war. Educator Song Jinxiang signed her son's name and appealed to all mothers in China to represent the power of peace, which means representing their own children, and to sign the Great Declaration!

　　保卫和平的力量
    建国部第十二支队六位战士的签名信中的话是动人的：“虽然我们手握着武器，但是我们却比任何人都更热烈爱好和平。我们拥护和平，我们决不害怕战争。帝国主义好战分子如果胆敢挑起战争，为了保卫和平，我们将供献出自己的一切。”
    中国人民解放军空军司令部通讯处二百八十二位战士在签名书上写道：“我们要握紧手中枪，坚决保卫祖国、保卫民族、保卫人民的领空、保卫世界持久和平！”
    西四皇城根十八号军属胡励生，在和平签名信中，还附了一封给毛主席的信，他说：“我们百姓都翻身了，您真是爱国爱民。我们决定拥护您，也就是拥护和平。”
    大陆照像馆的工人，深刻地在签名书上估计了美帝国主义的力量，说它怕和平，也怕战争！因为全人类的半数以上拥护世界和平，并不幻想和平；反对侵略战争，并不怕战争！这就能筑成一道坚强的和平长城！
    朝阳门内宽街甲一号全院三户人家的主妇们，在和大宣言上签了名，还代表全院的人写道：“我们一向对美帝抱着温情的幻想，报纸上常说美帝的罪行，我们觉得似是而非，然而我们读了和大宣言与郭沫若的演辞，我们明白了：美帝在两次大战中吃人血变肥了！我们不愿使无数的无辜的人民为他们作炮灰！”
    昌平县立南口完全小学师生八百三十二人参加了和平签名，并且一致决议每人要做到发动五个以上的家人与亲友参加签名。
    孩子们是新中国的下一代，他们必须在和平中建设新世界。保卫他们不再受战争的摧残，是每个父母的责任。教育工作者宋锦祥，为她的儿子签了名，还向全中国的母亲们号召，代表和平的力量，就是代表自己的孩子，在和大宣言上签名吧！
