    Beijing Coal and Iron Company
    Supports Private Kiln Production to Increase Coal Acquisition
    [Our Newspaper] For the past month, the coal from Mentougou has been slow to sell, and most of the coal produced by private coal kilns relies on the Beijing Coal and Iron Company for acquisition. In order to solve the livelihood problems of the workers, the Coal and Iron Company adopted a method of exchanging millet for coal, exchanging approximately 500 to 800 tons per day. After the spring rains, residents repaired their houses for rain protection, and lime sales increased, leading some coal trucks to be diverted to transport lime, further affecting the sales of Mentougou coal. In order to enable private kilns to continue production, the Coal and Iron Company has doubled the daily acquisition quantity and changed the millet exchange method to monetary acquisition (those willing to exchange for millet can still do so), to prevent workers from suffering losses when exchanging wages in millet for other supplies. For example, on the 26th, private kilns in Mentougou produced 1601.92 tons of coal, and the Coal and Iron Company acquired 1563 tons, accounting for 97.57% of the private kiln production. With the acquisition by the Coal and Iron Company, except for a few kilns that have not fully recovered, the current output is close to the pre-rain level. (Yin Bo)

　　北京市煤铁公司
    扶植私窑生产  增大收煤数量
    【本报讯】月来门煤滞销，私营煤窑产煤大部依靠北京市煤铁公司收购。煤铁公司为解决工人生活问题，曾采用以小米换煤办法，每日交换约五○○吨至八○○吨。春雨后市民防雨修房，石灰畅销，部分煤车转运石灰，更影响了门煤的销路。煤铁公司为使私窑继续生产，已将每日收购数量增大一倍，并将小米交换方式改用货币收购（愿折米者也可以），以免工人以工资米换购其它用品时遭受损失。如二十六日门头沟私营窑产煤一六○一·九二吨，煤铁公司收购即达一五六三吨，占私营产量百分之九七·五七。在煤铁公司收购下，除个别窑尚未完全恢复外，目前已接近雨前产量。          （音波）
