Xinhua News Agency, 30th: According to a TASS report citing the German News Agency: The President of the German Democratic Republic, Wilhelm Pieck, has signed the World Peace Council's peace declaration. Pieck stated that millions of signatures have been collected within the Democratic Republic, proving how widespread the idea of defending peace is in Germany. He said: Peace is under threat.

At the Bremen labor exchange, 15,000 people rushed to sign in the first five days.

　　德国人民要求和平
    萨克森州将近六百万人签名
    【新华社三十日讯】据塔斯社引德意志通讯社报道：德意志民主共和国总统皮克已在世界和大常委会和平宣言上签名。皮克表示：在民主共和国境内已经征集了数以百万计的签名，这证明了保卫和平的思想，在德国是如何的普遍。他说：和平正受着威胁。和平战士们必须尽其所能，把每一个德国人民吸引到世界和平阵线上来。定于十月间在罗马召开的世界和平大会，将是和平力量的盛大检阅。
    至十五日止，萨克森州签名者已达五百九十三万一千四百六十二人，即占该州人口百分之九十·七。梅格棱堡州签名者比率尤高，占人口百分之九十一·九。
    同时，在德境西方占领区和平签名运动的规模，亦至为广大。据不完全的统计，北莱因——威斯特伐利亚州至五月十七日止，签名者已达六十余万人。在不来梅劳工介绍所，头五天之内就有一万五千人争先签了名。下萨克森州并曾于十八日在“我们不替帝国主义者当炮灰”的口号下，召开拥护和平大会，通过了号召一切善良人民签名的决议，并电世界和大常委会与德国和平委员会致敬。
