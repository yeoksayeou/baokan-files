Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 19th: With the restoration and development of economic construction in Northeast China, displaced workers are finding employment one after another. According to incomplete statistics from the Northeast People's Government Labor Bureau, in the first quarter of this year, in addition to more than 100,000 long-term and temporary workers engaged in forestry transportation, more than 100,000 people also participated in the production and construction of state-owned industrial and mining enterprises. A large number of workers also participated in the production of public enterprises in various provinces and cities, with 2,529 in Yingkou City alone. The recruitment of these workers was conducted uniformly through labor exchanges in various regions under the leadership of the Northeast Workers Recruitment Committee. The Shenyang Labor Exchange averages 60 to 70 displaced workers registering every day. From December 13th of last year to April 22nd of this year, more than 4,000 people have been referred to appropriate production departments through the exchange. From January to March, Benxi Coal and Iron Company received 1,890 technical workers and 8,199 ordinary workers introduced from various regions. More than 9,900 workers also joined Anshan Iron and Steel Company. These numbers are still far from meeting the actual needs of the current large-scale construction work of various enterprises, especially for technical workers such as fitters, turners, milling machine operators, riveters, planers, and carpenters.

Currently, there are very few workers scattered in various cities in Northeast China engaged in vending, peddling, rickshaw driving, and other industries. Even if all of them are absorbed back into factories and mines, it will still not be enough to meet the needs of the booming industry. Therefore, in addition to striving to complete the plan for recruiting technical personnel and skilled workers within the customs area, relevant departments must also mobilize the surplus labor force in the rural areas of Northeast China to enter industrial production in order to meet the requirements of various industrial production and construction tasks.

Last year, with the vigorous recovery of industry in Northeast China, state-owned enterprises increased their employees by 240,000, many of whom have mastered certain production techniques, increasing the strength of industrial construction.

　　随着经济建设的恢复和发展
    东北流散工人大量就业 
    现仍计划在关内招聘技术工人并吸收农村剩余劳动力
    【新华社沈阳十九日电】随着东北经济建设的恢复和发展，流散工人纷纷就业。据东北人民政府劳动总局的不完全统计，今年第一季度中，除参加林业运输的长年工和临时工达十余万人外，还有十万余人参加了国营工矿企业的生产和修建工作。参加各省、市公营企业生产的工人数量亦大，仅营口市即有二千五百二十九人。这些工人的招聘，是经过东北工人招聘委员会领导下的各地劳动介绍所统一进行的。沈阳市劳动介绍所，每天平均有六、七十名流散工人进行登记。从去年十二月十三日至今年四月二十二日止，已有四千余人经过该所介绍到适当的生产部门。本溪煤铁公司在一、二、三月中，经各地介绍来的技术工人达一千八百九十名，普通工人八千一百九十九名。参加鞍山钢铁公司的工人，亦达九千九百余人。这些数目，如按当前的各企业大规模修建工作的实际需要看，仍有很大距离，特别是车、钳、铣、铆、刨、木瓦等技术工人则相差更多。
    现在流散于东北各城市从事摊贩、行商、三轮车夫等业的工人为数极少，即使全部吸收他们回到厂矿，亦不敷正在蓬勃发展中的工业需要。故有关方面除努力在关内完成招聘技术人员和技术工人的计划以外，尚须动员东北农村中的剩余劳动力进入工业生产，才能满足各种工业生产和建设工作的要求。
    去年东北工业的大力恢复，公营企业增加了职工二十四万人，他们之中有许多已掌握了一定的生产技术，增加了工业建设的力量。
