　　[Shenyang News] According to the Northeast Daily: The first tractor station in Northeast China has been established in the western suburbs of Shenyang and has begun using tractors to cultivate land on behalf of government farms and some organized farmers in the suburbs. On April 24th, Director Li Shi of the station personally led twenty tractors to the Masanjiazi Farm for cultivation. By the 27th, 1,000 mu had been plowed, and it is expected that all 5,000 mu of farmland will be sown before the 15th. Another ten tractors departed on the 5th to cultivate land on behalf of farmers in Dongshanbao, Shahe, and other villages in the Shalingpu District.

　　Currently, the station's mechanical equipment includes: thirty tractors (one combine harvester), two transport trucks, one air compressor truck, one welding truck, and one tool trailer. The personnel allocation includes: twenty-one tractor drivers (including six trainees), three technicians, four mechanics, and one truck driver. To facilitate cultivation, the station is divided into two teams by area, each team further divided into three groups, each group equipped with five tractors. The main targets for cultivation are government farms and organized farmers. This year, the station plans to cultivate 5,000 mu for the Masanjiazi Farm, one of the Shenyang Agricultural College experimental farms, and 2,000 mu for organized farmers in the suburbs. The method adopted is a contract system: government farms and organized farmers who wish to request cultivation fill out a cultivation entrustment form, which is investigated by personnel from the tractor station, and then a contract is signed to carry out the cultivation. For each hectare of land cultivated, the tractor station charges the beneficiary 2,000,000 Northeast currency (equivalent to over 160,000 RMB) for fuel, machinery repair, machinery depreciation, and labor costs, stipulating that two-thirds be paid in the spring and the remainder in the autumn. It is stipulated that the minimum area of land cultivated must be five hectares or more. Because some farmers who received cultivation services last year benefited greatly, such as harvesting 23 or 24 shi of rice per hectare of paddy field, with the tractor cultivation fee only costing one shi of rice, the demand for cultivation this year is extremely enthusiastic. According to statistics from the suburban office, the area for which farmers are now requesting cultivation is over 1,500 mu. It is estimated that it may exceed 2,000 mu.

　　沈阳市郊设拖拉机站
    给机关农场和组织起来的农民代耕
    【沈阳讯】据东北日报消息：东北第一个拖拉机站已于沈阳市西郊成立，开始以拖拉机给机关农场及市郊部分组织起来的农民代耕。四月二十四日该站李实主任亲率二十台拖拉机赴马三家子农场代耕，至二十七日已翻完一千亩，全场五千亩耕地可望于十五日前全部播种完。另十台拖拉机已于五日出发给沙岭堡区东山堡、沙河等村农民代耕。
    现该站机械装备有：拖拉机三十台（联合收割机一台），运输卡车两台，气泵车、电焊车、工具拖车等各一台。人员配备：拖拉机驾驶员二十一名（内有学员六名），技术员三名，技工四名，汽车司机一名。为便于代耕，特按地区编成两个队，每队又分成三个组，每组配备拖拉机五台。该站代耕的主要对象为机关农场及组织起来的农民，今年计划给沈阳农学院实验农场之一的马三家子农场代耕五千亩，给市郊组织起来的农民代耕二千亩。办法是采取合同制：凡欲要求代耕的机关农场和组织起来的农民填写代耕委托书，经拖拉机站派员调查，然后签订合同进行代耕。每耕一垧地，拖拉机站按成本向受代耕者收油料、机械修理、机械折旧、工资等项费用二百万元（东北币，合人民币十六万多元），规定春季付三分之二，其余秋后付给。规定代耕土地面积最低需五垧以上。由于去年部分受代耕农民得利很大，如代耕一垧水田秋收二十三、四石水稻，拖拉机代耕费仅一石稻子，因此今年要求代耕极为踊跃，据市郊办事处统计，现农民要求代耕之面积已有一千五百余亩。估计可超过二千亩。
