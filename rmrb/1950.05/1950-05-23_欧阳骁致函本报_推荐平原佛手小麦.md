　　Ouyang Xiao Writes to This Newspaper
　　Recommending Pingyuan Buddha's Hand Wheat

　　To the Editor:

　　During a wheat variety survey, I discovered that the Buddha's Hand Wheat (also known as Chicken Claw Wheat, Seven-Headed Wheat) currently grown by the masses in Xiuwu County, Wuzhi County, and Hui County of Pingyuan Province, has many similarities to the "Branched Wheat" that the friendly nation of the Soviet Union is actively cultivating. I will now introduce its morphology and characteristics as follows:

　　(1) Morphology: The stem height averages four to five feet, the stem wall is very thick, upright and does not fall over easily, the leaves are wide, and it has a high resistance to jaundice. The lower part of the ear has three to ten spikelets protruding four to eight fen [~1.3-2.6 cm], the spikelets are densely arranged, the glume is short, the back ridge is sharp, and the awn is very long; the awn, glume, and seed coat are all white. I have determined that it is a type of cone wheat (Tritieum turgidum) in wheat classification.

　　(2) Advantages: ① The yield is particularly high. According to the masses, if there is sufficient fertilizer and water, each mu [~0.067 hectares] can yield 600 jin [~300 kg], but it is usually 400 to 500 jin [~200-250 kg]. ② It has particularly strong resistance to jaundice and wind, as well as resistance to bird and fog damage. ③ The flour is particularly white.

　　(3) Disadvantages: ① The stem is hard, which is not very good for feeding livestock. This prevents the masses from planting it universally because the stalks are also an important product. ② The gluten is small (low protein), so it is not suitable for eating noodles; the masses only use it for steamed buns. ③ It requires sufficient fertilizer and water; if the land is poor, it will not branch. In the small plots of the Hui County Farm, only the ones on both sides of the waterway had branching; those far from the waterway not only had no branching, but the ears were also not large. ④ It matures ten to fifteen days later, affecting the yield of subsequent crops.

　　This type of wheat has not been seen in other regions, and to my knowledge, there is no detailed description of branched wheat in agricultural books in our country. Only Jin Shanbao's "Practical Wheat Theory" mentions a branched wheat variety in Xinjiang.

　　The All-Soviet Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences is currently working on cultivating a high-yielding and high-quality branched wheat, which can yield up to 1,200 jin [~600 kg], but due to some shortcomings and the fact that its cultivation techniques have not yet been well mastered, not much is planted.

　　According to the masses, although Buddha's Hand Wheat has various shortcomings, they believe that because it has the potential to produce more grain, if they have three mu of land, they can at least plant one mu. Therefore, it has gradually become popular in Xiuwu and Wuzhi.

　　I think this Buddha's Hand Wheat should be promoted immediately so that agricultural authorities, farms, and agricultural schools in various regions pay attention to it. On the one hand, it can be promoted, and on the other hand, it can be used as a basic material for seed improvement through Michurin hybridization work. I believe that this will produce wheat varieties with even greater yields.

　　Agricultural work is extremely time-sensitive. I hope it can be published before May 25th. Because the People's Daily can be sold all over the country, this will allow agricultural workers in various regions to know about it, and farms in various regions can send personnel to investigate and collect seeds for promotion and research. Arriving here before the beginning of June will allow them to catch up with the investigation and purchase of seeds.

　　I am now sending five ears of branched wheat and five ears of ordinary wheat. It would be best to make plates and publish them. The branched wheat specimens I sent are late-maturing, so they have not yet flowered, so they look relatively shriveled; ordinary wheat has already flowered and set its grain, and is about to mature.

　　With best regards,

　　欧阳骁致函本报
    推荐平原佛手小麦编辑同志：
    在小麦品种调查途中，我发现现在平原省修武县、武陟县、辉县群众所种植的佛手小麦（又叫鸡爪小麦，七头小麦），与友邦苏联现在正积极进行育成之“分枝小麦”（Branched wheat）有极多相似之点。现在把它的形态、特性介绍如下：
    （一）形态：秆高平均达四至五尺，秆壁甚厚，挺直不倒，叶宽，有高度抗黄疸能力。穗下部有三个至十个小穗突出四分至八分，小穗排列较密，外壳短，背脊锐利，芒甚长；芒、麦壳、种皮都是白色。我已确定其在小麦分类上为圆锥小麦（Tritieum turgidum）之一种。
    （二）优点：①产量特别大。群众反映如肥大、水足，每亩可收六百斤，普通多为四百至五百斤。②抗黄疸力、抗风力特强，并抗鸟害雾害。③面粉特别白。
    （三）缺点：①秆硬，喂牲口不太好，这使群众不能普遍种植，因为秆子也是重要的生产物。②面筋小（蛋白质少），不宜于吃面条，群众只用之吃馒头。③须肥大水足，地薄了就不出分枝，在辉县农场见其小区中，只有水道两边的有分枝，离水道远的不但无分枝，且穗子不大。④晚熟十天至十五天，影响后作产量。
    此种小麦在其他各地还没见过，在我国农业书籍中就我所知，亦无详述分枝小麦者，仅金善宝氏所著“实用小麦论”中，述及在新疆有一种具分枝之小麦品种。
    现在全苏列宁农业科学院正从事育成一种丰产质佳之分枝小麦，其产量已能高达一千二百斤，但以其具有某些缺点，且其栽培技术尚未能很好掌握，故种植还不太多。
    据群众反映，佛手小麦虽具有种种缺点，但以其有多打粮食的条件，认为如有三亩地至少可以种上一亩，所以在修武、武陟已渐渐普及。
    我想这个佛手小麦应当即时提出予以宣传，使各地农业机关、农场、农业学校加以注意，一方面可以用之推广，一方面又可以其为种子改良的基本材料进行米邱林杂交工作，相信由此会产生有更大产量的小麦品种。
    农业工作极具时间性，望能于五月二十五日以前刊出。因人民日报能行销各地，这样就能使各地农业工作者普遍知道，各地农场就可以派员前来调查、采种，供做推广和研究之用。在六月上旬以前来到此地，还可以赶得上调查并收购种子。
    今寄上分枝小麦穗子五个及普通小麦穗子五个，最好能制版刊出。所寄标本分枝小麦，因晚熟，所以还未开花，故看上去较瘪；普通小麦早已开花定浆，快届成熟。此致敬礼
