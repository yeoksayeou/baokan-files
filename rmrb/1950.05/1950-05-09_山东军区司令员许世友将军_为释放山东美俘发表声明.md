Xinhua News Agency, 8th: General Xu Shiyou, Commander of the Shandong Military Region of the People's Liberation Army of the People's Republic of China, has issued the following statement regarding the release of American prisoners in Shandong:

　　On October 19, 1948, at approximately 12:30 PM, an American Navy aircraft that violated our nation's airspace landed near Dayanjiacun Village in the Longshan District of Haiyang County, Jiaodong. Both the aircraft and its pilots, Bender and Smith, were captured by our forces.

　　At that time, the Headquarters of the Shandong Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army immediately inspected the captured aircraft and personnel. It was discovered that the aircraft was an L-5 type aircraft (numbered ○Y○2767) suitable for reconnaissance purposes, carrying forms and various military maps belonging to the American intelligence agency, the 44th Foreign Field Measurement Team (also known as the Overseas Inspection Group). It was also discovered that both Bender and Smith were active-duty American military personnel. Therefore, it was decided to impound the aircraft and treat the personnel as prisoners of war. However, Bender and Smith remained steadfast in their refusal to disclose the motives and mission behind this illegal flight.

　　Until recently, influenced by our lenient policy towards prisoners of war, Bender and Smith confessed that "the purpose of the flight was to observe the railway, as there was a report that there was activity along the railway in the Liberated Areas. They were also to observe any construction projects in Laiyang... because they had a report that the People's Liberation Army was maintaining a large number of troops there." Bender also admitted, "Major Lanz told me where to fly, and Smith's job was to observe construction projects along our flight path." According to their confession, the aircraft's flight path originated from Cangkou Airport, conducting reconnaissance along the railway, then detouring to Laiyang to scout military construction, before turning back to Qingdao, and landing in Haiyang County en route. The above facts and confessions prove that the purpose of this arbitrary violation of our airspace by American imperialism was to conduct planned military reconnaissance to aid the anti-people war of the Kuomintang bandit gang.

　　Based on the above circumstances, the Headquarters of the Shandong Military Region has decided to confiscate the aircraft that violated our airspace and conducted military reconnaissance. As for Bender and Smith, having expressed remorse, we will adhere to our army's lenient policy towards prisoners of war, release them, and send them out of the country.

　　The crime of American imperialism in dispatching American military personnel to pilot aircraft to intrude into our airspace and conduct reconnaissance of our military operations to aid the Kuomintang bandit gang has been committed more than once. On April 5, 1948, an American aircraft and four American military personnel were captured by our forces in Hongshiya, Jiaoxian County. Only after Admiral Badger, Commander of the US Western Pacific Fleet, personally acknowledged the error in writing on June 29 of the same year and guaranteed that similar incidents would not occur again, did we release the captured personnel. This crime of American imperialism in violating Chinese sovereignty and aiding the Kuomintang bandit gang in carrying out an anti-Chinese people's war has long been resented by the entire Chinese people. Any attempt by American imperialism to infringe upon our sacred sovereignty will be met with a relentless blow from the Chinese people.

　　山东军区司令员许世友将军
    为释放山东美俘发表声明
    【新华社八日讯】中华人民共和国人民解放军山东军区司令员许世友将军顷发表关于释放山东美俘事件声明如下：
    一九四八年十月十九日中午十二时半左右，有侵犯我国领空之美国海军飞机一架，降落在胶东海阳城龙山区大阎家村附近，飞机和驾驶员班德尔与史密斯二人都被我方俘获。
    当时我中国人民解放军山东军区司令部，立即将此项被俘之飞机与人员，加以检查，不但发现该飞机的类型是可做侦察用途的Ｌ——５式飞机（编号为○Ｙ○二七六七），载有美国特务机关第四十四外勤测量队（又称国外视察组）的表格和各种军用地图；同时发现班德尔和史密斯都是美国的现役军人，因而决定将该项飞机，予以扣留，人员按照俘虏加以看管。然而班德尔与史密斯两人对于造成此次非法飞行之动机与任务，仍坚不吐实。
    直至最近，班德尔与史密斯两人，因受我对待俘虏宽大政策之感化，始行供称：“此次飞行目的是在察看铁路，盖因当时有一报告说，在解放区沿铁路地带有活动，同时还去察看莱阳有何建筑工程，……因为他们有报告说，人民解放军在那里维持着大量的部队。”班德尔亦招认说：“兰兹少校告诉我应飞向何处，史密斯的工作是在我们飞行沿途察看建筑工程。”又据供称：该机飞行路线，系自沧口机场起飞，沿铁路进行侦察，然后又折至莱阳侦察军事建筑，再转回青岛，于途中降落海阳县境。以上事实和供词，都证明了美帝国主义此次恣意侵犯我领空之飞行，其目的是从事有计划的军事侦察，以帮助国民党匪帮的反人民战争。
    我山东军区司令部根据上述情况，兹特决定将该侵犯我领空、进行军事侦察的飞机予以没收。至于班德尔与史密斯两人，既已表示悔悟，仍本我军对待俘虏的宽大政策，予以释放，遣送出境。
    查美国帝国主义派遣美军人员驾驶飞机侵入我领空、侦察我军事行动，以帮助国民党匪帮的罪行，已犯过不止一次。一九四八年四月五日，曾有美机一架及美军人员四名在胶县红石崖被我俘获，在美西太平洋舰队司令白吉尔于同年六月二十九日亲笔书面承认错误并保证不再发生类似事件后，我方始将被俘人员释放。美帝国主义此种侵犯中国主权、帮助国民党匪帮进行反中国人民战争的罪行，久为全中国人民所痛恨。美帝国主义任何侵犯我国神圣主权的阴谋行为，都将受到中国人民的无情打击。
   一九五○年五月八日
