　　New Construction of Democratic Power in Major Cities

    The Beijing Municipal People's Government, with the approval of the State Council of the Central People's Government, has today announced the "Organizational Regulations for the District People's Representative Conferences in Beijing," and will begin piloting it in several districts of the city, drawing on experience in order to promote it throughout the city. This is a new undertaking in our construction of democratic power in major cities.

    The Second Session of the Second Beijing Municipal People's Representative Conference, held in February this year, based on the experience of Beijing's democratic construction over the past year and the needs of actual work, passed the following resolution: "The conference resolved to establish district people's representative conferences. It will be piloted in two or three districts first. The organizational regulations and implementation measures shall be formulated by the Consultative Committee in consultation with the Municipal People's Government and submitted to the Central People's Government for approval before implementation." The passage of this resolution and the publication of these organizational regulations represent a development process in the construction of our people's urban power.

    In the early days of the liberation of the cities, due to the influence of the old organizational forms of power and the mechanical application of certain working methods and organizational forms from the countryside to the cities, some cities adopted a three-level power structure of municipality, district, and street to carry out work, and established street governments. Many tasks were pushed to the street governments, which divided the centralized city into many independent units. Multiple departments issued orders, causing confusion, which was very detrimental to the work. Last year, Beijing and other cities successively abolished the organizational form of street power, reduced the size and authority of district organizations, and realized centralized leadership at the municipal level. These were all correct and necessary.

    Experience has proven that street governments should not be restored or established in cities; districts are only a link between higher and lower levels, not completely independent levels. These should be affirmed. However, the district-level organizations should be appropriately expanded and should not be excessively reduced. Especially in large cities like Beijing, the population is larger than in general cities, and the work tasks of the districts are also heavier. Therefore, its organizational form should, on the one hand, conform to the principle of streamlining, and on the other hand, should not be excessively reduced or weakened. Currently, Beijing City is divided into nine districts. The most populous district has 220,000 people, and the least populous has more than 100,000. The people of each district have many specific opinions and requests regarding the public welfare undertakings of their respective districts, such as public health and municipal construction. In terms of eliminating bandits and thieves and consolidating public security, it is also necessary to mobilize the people of each district to directly assist the public security organs. In particular, government workers need to constantly receive direct criticism and supervision from the masses. All of this cannot be fully realized if we rely solely on the efforts of the city-wide People's Representative Conference and the Municipal People's Government. Moreover, the number of representatives to the city-wide People's Representative Conference cannot be unlimited, and it is practically impossible for too many people to directly discuss the specific issues of each district. Now, the publication of the "Organizational Regulations for the District People's Representative Conferences in Beijing" basically solves this problem.

    The organizational regulations stipulate that the nature of the district People's Representative Conference is currently a consultative body, and in the future, under certain conditions, it can also exercise the functions and powers of the district People's Congress. In large cities, in addition to convening the Municipal People's Representative Conference, there is also an agency like the district People's Representative Conference, which can establish a wider and closer connection between the government and the urban people, concentrate more of the people's opinions and demands, and realize the government's various work plans; it can specifically discuss and solve the public welfare and municipal construction issues of the people in each district, and the people in each district can directly protect these constructions and prevent damage. Similarly, this can also facilitate the mobilization of the masses to assist in consolidating public security. More importantly, through the district People's Representative Conference, we can carry out criticism and self-criticism, mobilize the masses, expose the corruption, degeneration, and coercive commandism of some government workers, overcome the shortcomings and errors in our work, which will greatly strengthen the people's direct supervision and management of the government, and maintain a more direct, closer, and consolidated connection between the people and their government.

    We hope that Beijing will soon pilot the convening of district People's Representative Conferences in several districts, and after gaining experience, it can not only be promoted in all districts of Beijing, but also provide important assistance to the construction of democratic power in other major cities across the country.

### 大城市民主政权的新建设

　　大城市民主政权的新建设
    北京市人民政府，经中央人民政府政务院批准，于今日公布了“北京市区各界人民代表会议组织通则”，并即将在市内几个区试行，吸取经验，以便推广于全市。这是我们在大城市中民主政权建设上的一件新的工作。
    今年二月间召开的北京市第二届第二次各界人民代表会议，根据北京市一年来民主建政的经验和实际工作的需要，曾通过如下决议：“大会决议设立区各界人民代表会议。先选择两三个区试行。其组织条例及实施办法，授权协商委员会商同市人民政府制定，呈请中央人民政府批准后施行。”这个决议的通过和现在这个组织通则的公布，表示着我们人民城市政权建设的一个发展过程。
    在城市解放的初期，由于旧的政权组织形式的影响和农村中的某些工作方法与组织形式被机械运用于城市，因此，在有些城市中，曾采取了市、区、街三级政权的形式来进行工作，并建立了街政府，许多工作都被推到街政府去做，就使得集中的城市实际上被分割为许多各自为政的单位。政出多门，发生混乱，对工作是十分不利的。去年北京市及其他城市都先后取消了街政权的组织形式，缩小了区的机构和职权，实现了市一级的集中领导。这些都是正确的和必要的。
    经验证明，在城市中不应该恢复或建立街政府；区也只是承上启下的一级，而不是完全独立的一级。这些都是应该肯定的。但区级的机构则应适当地扩大一些，不宜过于缩小。特别是像北京这样的大城市，人口比一般城市为多，区级的工作任务亦较重，因此，它的组织形式，一方面要合乎精简的原则，另一方面又不应过分缩减与削弱。目前北京城内共划为九个区，每一个区的人口，最多者为二十二万，最少者亦在十万以上。各区人民对于各该区的公共福利事业，如公共卫生、市政建设等，都有许多具体的意见和要求。在肃清盗匪、小偷、巩固治安等方面，也需要发动各区人民直接协助公安机关来进行。特别是政府的工作人员需要经常得到人民群众直接的批评和督促。这一切，如果仅仅依靠全市的各界人民代表会议和市人民政府的努力，还是不能完满实现的。而且全市的各界人民代表会议的代表名额不能没有限度，人数过多或直接讨论各区的具体问题，实际上都是不可能的。现在，《北京市区各界人民代表会议组织通则》的公布，基本上就解决了这个问题。
    组织通则规定区各界人民代表会议的性质，在目前是协议机关，将来在一定条件下亦可代行区人民代表大会的职权。在大城市中除了召开市各界人民代表会议之外，又有了区各界人民代表会议这样的机关，就可以使政府与城市人民建立更广泛更密切的联系，更多地集中人民的意见和要求，实现政府的各项工作计划；就可以具体地讨论与解决各区人民的公共福利和市政建设的问题，并由各区人民群众直接来保护这些建设，防止破坏。同样，这也就可以更便利于发动群众，协助进行巩固治安的工作。更重要的是通过区各界人民代表会议，开展批评与自我批评，发动群众，检举政府中的某些工作人员的贪污、腐化和强迫命令的作风，克服我们工作中的缺点和错误，这就会大大地加强人民对政府的直接监督与管理，使人民和自己的政府保持更直接、更密切的巩固的联系。
    我们希望北京市最近在几个区试行召开区各界人民代表会议，取得经验之后，不但可以推广于北京市各区，而且对于全国其他大城市民主政权的建设也能够有重要的帮助。
