　　Celebrating the Soviet Publishing Festival
    Learning from Advanced Soviet Publishing Workers
    Hu Yuzhi
    Today—May 5th—is the birthday of the great teacher of the world's working people, Marx, and also the Soviet people's Publishing Festival.

    On May 5, 1912, the Bolshevik Party organ, the *Pravda*, founded by Lenin himself, was launched in Petersburg.

    In 1922, the Eleventh Congress of the Bolshevik Party, in commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the founding of *Pravda*, stipulated that May 5th of each year be the Soviet People's Publishing Festival.

    The Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government have always attached importance to publishing work, because it is a powerful weapon for organizing and educating the broad masses of the people and building a socialist society.

    In the Soviet Union, there are thousands of newspapers and magazines, and tens of thousands of new books are published every year, in 119 different languages. From 1918 to 1946, the Soviet Union published 859,000 kinds of books, totaling 10.7 billion copies. In 1949 alone, 700 million copies of books were printed, and this year there will be about 800 million copies. Among them, the number of copies issued for each edition of the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" exceeds 34 million.

    Not only is the number of types and copies of books and newspapers increasing year by year, but the quality and ideological level of Soviet publications are also constantly improving. As the main weapon of ideological struggle, the Soviet publishing industry is not the same as the capitalist countries' publishing industry, which is purely for profit and promotes reactionary ideas. Soviet publishing workers regard each publishing organization as a true ideological fortress, carrying out the tasks given by the Party and the government—according to the instructions of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to the Soviet Publishing Bureau, the task of publishing workers is: "To arm the broadest masses—the builders of socialism—with the knowledge of Marxist-Leninist theory and technical production. Books must be the most powerful weapon to educate, mobilize, and organize the masses around economic and cultural construction work. The quality of books must meet the masses' ever-increasing cultural demands."

    Soviet newspaper, magazine, and book publishing workers have faithfully carried out this glorious and arduous combat mission. The reason why Soviet publishing workers have been able to improve the quantity and quality of publications, implement and complete the important tasks of educating, mobilizing, and organizing the masses to carry out socialist construction is because Soviet publishing workers adopt a serious revolutionary work attitude of being responsible to the Party, the state, and the people; it is because Soviet publishing workers are closely linked to the masses and serve the interests of the working class and the broad masses of working people; it is because Soviet publishing workers accept the leadership of the Party and the government and closely cooperate with the state policies of economic construction and cultural construction; it is also because Soviet publishing workers are good at using the weapon of criticism and self-criticism, constantly correcting mistakes, and improving their Marxist-Leninist political and ideological qualities to improve the quality of publications.

    These advantages and characteristics of Soviet publishing workers are worth learning for publishing workers in our new China.

    The problem we are currently facing is: a great new country is beginning to be built. We need countless excellent newspapers, magazines, and books to educate, mobilize, and organize the broad masses of our people. We need to clear the remaining dregs of feudal and colonial society from the minds of most of the people. We need to make the broad masses of the people gain and be accustomed to the feeling of fresh things, and give them a correct outlook on life and the world. The people also require us to provide a large amount of Marxist-Leninist theory and technical production knowledge, so as to gradually improve their cultural level on the basis of popularization.

    To carry out all this work, we must take up publishing, this important combat weapon. Naturally, at present, everything is just beginning. Our material conditions are still very poor. We still have a large number of illiterates, accounting for the majority of the population, and it will take time to eliminate them. Before the high tide of economic construction arrives, it is impossible for us to develop the publishing industry on the same large scale as the advanced Soviet publishing industry in terms of quantity. However, in order to prepare for the future high tide of cultural construction and undertake the arduous task of ideological struggle, we must take Soviet publishing workers as our model, adopt the same serious attitude of being responsible to the people, closely link with the masses, cooperate with national policies, and, most importantly, carry out criticism and self-criticism, correct the bad habits of shoddy production, seeming right but actually wrong, and "not seeking thorough understanding", in order to earnestly do a good job in publishing and push the current backward publishing industry forward. For this purpose, we must learn from advanced Soviet publishing workers, and learn again.

    The Soviet people have given significant assistance to our newborn country in all aspects, and this is also true in publishing. In the short time of six months since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Soviet International Bookstore has provided Chinese readers with a large number of inexpensive and excellent books and periodicals. The Soviet Foreign Languages Publishing House has successively published many Chinese versions of Marxist-Leninist works for Chinese readers. In the past difficult years, the help that Chinese publishing workers and readers have received from Soviet friends is incalculable. Due to the victory of the Chinese revolution and the increasing friendship between China and the Soviet Union, today, we have every opportunity to learn from the Soviet Union, and it is no longer a difficult task to learn from Soviet publishing workers.

    Congratulations on the Soviet People's Publishing Festival!

    Salute to the advanced Soviet publishing workers!

### 庆贺苏联出版节  向先进的苏联出版工作者学习

　　庆贺苏联出版节
    向先进的苏联出版工作者学习
    胡愈之
    今天——五月五日——是全世界劳动人民伟大导师马克思的诞辰，同时又是苏联人民的出版节。
    一九一二年五月五日，列宁所手创的布尔什维克党的机关报《真理报》在彼得堡创刊。
    一九二二年，布尔什维克党第十一次代表大会，为了纪念《真理报》创刊十周年，规定每年五月五日为苏联人民的出版节。
    布尔什维克党和苏联政府一贯地重视出版工作，是因为出版工作是组织和教育广大人民，建设社会主义社会的强大武器。
    在苏联，有数千种报纸杂志，并且每年有数万种新书，用一百十九种不同的文字出版。从一九一八到一九四六年，苏联出版了八十五万九千种书籍，一共印行了一百零七亿册。在一九四九年一年中，印行的书籍达七亿册，在今年将有八亿册左右。其中如《联共（布）党史简明教程》，每版发行的数量超过三千四百万册。
    不仅是书报发行的种数和册数在逐年增加，苏联出版书报的质量和思想水平，也在不断地提高。作为主要的思想斗争武器的苏联出版事业，和单纯以营利为目的和宣传反动思想的资本主义国家出版事业，没有相同之处。苏联出版工作者把每一出版机构作为真正的思想堡垒，执行党和政府所给予的任务——根据联共（布）党给苏联出版局的指示，出版工作者的任务是：“以马列主义理论和技术生产的知识武装最广大的群众——社会主义建设者。书籍必须是教育、动员并组织群众环绕在经济和文化建设工作的周围的最强大的武器。书籍的素质必须符合群众日益高涨的文化要求。”
    这一光荣的艰巨的战斗任务，苏联报纸、杂志、书籍的出版工作者是忠实地执行了。苏联出版工作者所以能够提高出版的数量质量，执行而且完成教育、动员、组织群众以进行社会主义建设的重大任务，是由于苏联出版工作者采取对党、国家和人民负责的严肃的革命工作态度；是由于苏联出版工作者紧密联系群众，为工人阶级和广大劳动群众的利益服务；是由于苏联出版工作者接受党和政府领导，密切配合经济建设和文化建设的国家政策；也是由于苏联出版工作者善于运用批评与自我批评的武器，不断纠正错误，提高自己的马列主义的政治性和思想性，以改进出版物素质。
    苏联出版工作者这些优点和特点，对于我们新中国的出版工作者，是值得学习的。
    我们目前所面对着的问题是：一个伟大的新国家正在开始建造中。我们需要无数的优良的报纸、杂志、书籍，来教育、动员和组织我国的广大人民。我们需要从大部分人民的头脑中清除封建社会与殖民地社会的残余渣滓。我们需要使广大人民获得而且习惯以新鲜事务的感觉，使他们具有正确的人生观和世界观。人民也要求我们大量供给马列主义理论和技术生产知识，以在普及的基础上逐渐提高他们的文化水平。
    要进行这一切工作，必须拿起出版这一重要的战斗武器。自然，在目前，一切都还正在开头。我们的物质条件还十分贫乏。我们还留着占人口极大部分的文盲，需要时间加以消灭。在经济建设的高潮到来之前，我们要在数量上向先进的苏联出版事业看齐，同样大规模地来发展出版事业，是不可能的。但是为了准备迎接未来的文化建设高潮，担负起思想斗争的艰巨任务，我们必须拿苏联出版工作者作为模范，采取同样的对人民负责的严肃态度，要紧密地联系群众，配合国家政策，而最重要的是展开批评与自我批评，纠正粗制滥造，似是而非和“不求甚解”的不良作风，才能认真作好出版工作，把目前的落后的出版事业向前推进一步。为了这个目的，我们就必须向先进的苏联出版工作者学习，再学习。
    苏联人民对于我们新生的国家，在各方面都给了重大的援助，在出版方面也是如此。在中华人民共和国成立以后不过半年的时间，苏联国际书店就供给了中国读者以大量的价格低廉的优良书刊。苏联外文出版局为了中国读者，先后出版了许多种中文版的马列主义著作。在过去这些困难年头中，中国的出版工作者和读者，所得到的苏联友人的帮助，是不可计算的。由于中国革命的胜利，和中苏友好关系的日益增进，在今天，我们有一切机会向苏联学习，而向苏联出版工作者学习，更不是一件难事了。
    庆贺苏联人民出版节！
    向先进的苏联出版工作者们致敬！
