The demonstrators responded with warm applause to the Chinese representative's speech and cheered the name of Mao Zedong. The Soviet representative called for strengthening the unity of the working class and strengthening the struggle for peace. His speech was met with stormy applause.

The demonstrators carried huge portraits of Stalin and demanded the strengthening of friendship with the leader of the progressive, peace, and democratic camp - the great Soviet Union.

　　At the same time, the splitters of Berlin and the running dogs of the American and British warmongers, with the assistance of the police and the military police of the British occupation forces, organized a gathering inside the Reichstag building in the British-occupied area of Berlin, attended by only a few thousand citizens. All progressive residents of West Berlin joined the laboring people of East Berlin in the grand demonstration at Lustgarten Square, with a total of one million participants.

　　This demonstration proved that the laboring people of Berlin are prepared to fight for peace, the unification of Germany, the unity of the working class, and the strengthening of the German Democratic Republic. They also announced their determination to wage an uncompromising struggle against the warmongers and their German running dogs Adenauer and Schumacher. Similar demonstrations were also held in other cities of the German Democratic Republic and some cities in West Germany. The slogan of the demonstrations was to strengthen the peace camp and oppose the instigators of war.
