　　Accepting Advanced Soviet Technical Guidance
    Baoshi Section's Six Major Bridges Completed Ahead of Schedule
    [Baoding Dispatch] Reporter Lǚ Guāngmíng reports: During the repair of the substructure of the six major bridges such as the Shahe River and Hutuo River on the northern section of the Beijing-Hankou Railway by the First Engineering Office of the Railway Corps, due to the on-site guidance of Soviet bridge expert Bagryev, the main technical difficulties were resolved, enabling the completion of the first phase of the project ahead of schedule, and saving a lot of labor and materials. In January, the office began to remove the caisson foundations of the concrete bridge piers of the Wukong River and Hutuo River. Everyone believed that any cracks on the caissons had to be completely removed, otherwise danger would occur. The No. 10 caisson of the Wukong River had been cleared to a depth of eight meters, and there were still cracks on the well wall. At that time, due to the lack of waterproof tools, mud dredgers, and large water pumps, there was no way to continue chiseling down, causing the project to stall. In early February, after Soviet bridge expert General Bagryev personally inspected it, he pointed out that the well wall was buried at the bottom of the river and had the crowding force of soil and sand, so even if there were cracks, it would not be dangerous. It was only necessary to remove the loose parts, then connect and tamp them with concrete, and grout the larger cracks below to make them join. With the technical difficulties resolved, the morale of the workers was unprecedentedly high, and the construction project became active again.
    When pouring concrete bridge piers at the Mudao Ditch River, it was the severe winter season. At that time, the anti-freezing measures taken were to add salt water to the concrete, light stoves, and build warm sheds, which wasted a lot of coal but had little effect. General Bagryev instructed the "thermos bottle" anti-freezing method, that is, to put another layer of board outside the formwork, add straw in the middle, and mix the concrete with hot water, so that a certain temperature can be maintained inside the pier. The office adopted this advanced working method, which enabled the completion of all concrete projects of the six major bridges in the Baoshi section ahead of schedule, and saved 18,400 man-days and 12,000 catties of millet in fuel costs.

　　接受苏联先进技术指导
    保石段六大正桥提前完工
    【本报保定专讯】记者吕光明报道：铁道兵团第一工程处修复京汉路北段沙河、滹沱河等六大正桥的下部结构时，由于苏联桥梁专家巴格列夫的现场指导，解决了技术上的主要困难，使第一期工程得以提前完成，并节省了许多人工和材料。一月间，该处开始清除悟空河、滹沱河洋灰混凝土的桥墩井桶基础，大家认为井桶上凡有裂纹的地方，都必须彻底铲掉，否则会发生危险。悟空河第十号井桶已清除到八公尺深的地方，井壁上还有裂纹。当时因缺乏防水工具，又没有掏泥机和大的抽水机，再无办法往下凿除，致使工程陷于停顿。二月初，经苏联桥梁专家巴格列夫将军亲往勘察，指出井桶壁因埋在河底，有土沙的拥挤力，虽有裂纹也不会发生危险。只需将发酥的部分清除，再用洋灰混凝土接打起来，下面裂纹大的地方，用洋灰灌浆使之接合即可。由于技术困难得到解决，职工们信心空前提高，修建工程又活跃起来了。
    在木道沟河打洋灰混凝土的桥墩时，正值严寒季节。当时所采取的防寒办法是洋灰加食盐水、生炉火、搭暖棚，浪费煤斤很多，收效却很少。巴格列夫将军指示了“暖瓶式”的防寒法，即在模型板外面再套上一层板子，中间加上稻草，用热水拌合混凝土，如此便可保持墩内一定的温度。该处采用了此种先进工作方法，使保石段六大正桥全部混凝土工程得以提前完成，并节省了一万八千四百个日工，和一万二千斤小米的燃料费用。
