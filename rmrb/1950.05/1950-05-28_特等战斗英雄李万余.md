Special-Class Combat Hero Li Wanyu
    Fang Fang
    In early May, the Southern Jiangxi Military Region held its first congress of heroes and models. At the congress, Comrade Li Wanyu was elected as a first-class hero and model, and a special-class combat hero.
    Prior to this, the 142nd Division held a congress of heroes and models, and Comrade Li Wanyu was also elected as a "comprehensive model." He is an outstanding hero and model figure of the division. In more than two years of service, he has been awarded eight major merits and two minor merits in combat and work, and has been awarded a Zhu De Medal, a Bravery Medal, two Hero Medals, and a Hard Struggle Medal.
    Comrade Li Wanyu grew up in central Rehe. He had worked for landlords and also learned to be a craftsman. He joined the People's Liberation Army on the second day of the eighth lunar month in 1947.
    Not long after joining the army, the troops marched to the Beining Railway near the Daling River. It was the bitterly cold "third nine" period. He stepped through two or three feet of snow, closely following the assault team. The scattered enemy ran around like a flock of sheep. He shouted to his comrades, "Those who aren't afraid to die, follow me to chase them!" He then jumped with all his might, leaping over the trench next to the railway. He surrounded ten enemies and captured a light machine gun. Li Wanyu, who had just shown his skills, earned a major merit.
    Then, the famous Battle of Longhua in 1948 broke out. Recalling the situation at the time, he said, "At that time, I was the leader of the firepower assault group, and my task was to cover the fourth squad as they blasted the outer deer fences and barbed wire of the northwest corner bunker complex. I assured the fourth squad that as long as they blasted it open, we could consolidate the breakthrough. When the deer fences and barbed wire flew into the sky with the sound of explosions, we rushed up. The enemy fired desperately from both sides. We skillfully used the terrain and defeated the enemy with a barrage of hand grenades." At this moment, he was wounded, but he ignored it, saying, "As long as I have a breath, I must complete the task!" He threw several hand grenades in a row, accurately hitting the enemy's machine gun bunkers. What came out of the gun holes was no longer the rattling of machine guns, but bursts of black smoke... Not only did he complete the task of firepower cover for the assault, but he also delivered explosives three times in a row while wounded, blasting the enemy's bunker complex that they relied on to struggle. This time, he earned two major merits.
    In the winter of 1948, Li Wanyu was already the squad leader of the fourth squad. Before the first shot of the Pingjin Campaign—the Battle of Miyun—he asked the platoon leader for the task of leading the assault team. The platoon leader smiled and said, "This time, you will be the reserve team." Although the fourth squad was a reserve team, under the leadership of Li Wanyu, the squad's fighting morale was very high. Everyone said, "When it's time to fight, we'll rush up!" Li Wanyu made this decision: "If you see an opportunity, you'll listen to my command!"
    When the vanguard assault team launched an attack on the northeast corner of Miyun City, several of the front assault team were killed or wounded, and they were blocked by enemy fire, unable to rush up. Li Wanyu carefully looked at the terrain and said, "We can't advance from the open ground, let's attack from the small ditch on the side!" He shouted, "Fourth squad! Go!" He led his comrades to rush up the city wall. With a burst of fierce submachine gun fire and hand grenades, the enemy retreated; but the enemy immediately counterattacked. At this time, the enemy and we were fighting fiercely on the city wall, and there wasn't even time to pull the pin on the hand grenades. They used bricks and stones from the city wall to strike the enemy. He divided the soldiers into three groups, inserted them from both sides, and launched a roundabout encirclement. Under the suppression of our three-sided firepower, the enemy fled in panic into the bunkers. He blocked the bunker door with a burst of submachine gun fire, and then casually threw in a few hand grenades. The enemy couldn't resist anymore and demanded, "Don't shoot, we surrender!" Then more than twenty prisoners crawled out of the bunker. This time, he earned two more major merits.
    Being both a combat hero and a work model is the characteristic of Comrade Li Wanyu. He has always been active and responsible in his work. During the southward march, he was the chairman of the company's revolutionary soldiers' committee. He often convened meetings of various committee members to study various work issues. Therefore, the revolutionary soldiers' committee played a great role during the southward march, and the troops' mass discipline and food were all done very well. During the southward march, he carried two backpacks and two guns. As soon as he arrived at the campsite, he boiled water for the soldiers to soak their feet, and bought steamed buns and eggs for the sick soldiers to eat. Although he was so tired that his eyes were red, he did not relax his work at all. When the troops reached the north bank of the Yangtze River and were evaluating merits, Li Wanyu once again earned two major merits.
    After crossing the river, he was transferred to the battalion's grain collection team. Wherever he went, he first carried out propaganda among the people, exposing the enemy's deception and rumors. He personally helped the people grind grain and deliver grain. In this way, not only was the food supply for the troops successfully guaranteed, but also the mass work was done well. Therefore, he earned another major merit.
    The people's meritorious servant is not accidental. Comrade Li Wanyu has been consistently good from the time he joined the army to the present. Under the education and cultivation of the Party, he is constantly making progress. Now, he is the deputy platoon leader of the third company of the 424th Regiment.

　　特等战斗英雄李万余
    方放
    五月上旬，赣西南军区举行首届英模大会。在大会上，李万余同志当选为一级英雄模范、特等战斗英雄。
    在这以前，一四二师举行英模大会，李万余同志也当选了“全面模范”。他是该师杰出的英模人物，他参军两年多，在战斗和工作中，曾立了八个大功、两个小功，荣获朱德奖章一枚、勇敢奖章一枚、英雄奖章两枚、坚苦奋斗奖章一枚。
    李万余同志生长在热河中部，给地主扛过活，也曾学过工匠。他在一九四七年旧历八月节的第二天参加了人民解放军。
    入伍不久，部队开到大凌河畔的北宁路。那是严寒的“三九”天气，他踏着两三尺深的雪，紧跟着突击队前进。被冲散的敌人像一群羊似的乱跑。他向同志们喊道：“不怕死的，跟我来追呀！”便使劲一跃，跃过铁路旁边的壕沟。围住十个敌人，缴获轻机枪一挺。初试锋芒的李万余，就立了一个大功。
    接着，一九四八年有名的隆化战斗打响了。他回忆当时的情况说：“我那时是火力突击组的战斗组长，任务是掩护四班爆破西北角碉堡群外围的鹿砦和铁丝网。我向四班保证：只要他们爆破开，我们就能巩固突破口。当鹿砦和铁丝网随着爆炸声飞向天空时，我们就冲上去了，敌人两侧火力拚命的射击，我们灵活的利用地形，一阵手榴弹，把敌人打败了。”就在这个时候，他挂花了；但他并没理会，说：“只要有口气，就得完成任务！”他一连几个手榴弹，准确的打进敌人机枪堡垒，从枪眼出来的再不是格格的机枪声，而是一阵阵的黑烟……。他不但完成了火力掩护的突击任务，又带伤连续送上三次炸药，爆破了敌人赖以挣扎的碉堡群。这次，他立了两大功。
    一九四八年冬，李万余已经是四班的班长了，在平津战役第一炮——密云战斗前，他向排长要求突击队任务。排长笑着说：“这回你们作预备队吧。”虽然四班是预备队，但在李万余的领导下，班里的战斗情绪很高。大伙说：“打的时候，我们就抢上去！”李万余作了这样的决定：“瞧上机会，你们就听我指挥！”
    当先头突击队向密云城东北角发起冲锋时，前面突击队伤亡了好几个，又被敌人火力所阻，不能冲上去。李万余仔细的看了看地形说：“不能从开阔地前进，我们打旁边小沟上去吧！”他便喊道：“四班！上！”他领头带着同志们冲上城墙。一阵猛烈的冲锋枪和手榴弹，敌人溃退下去了；但敌人马上又反冲上来。这时敌我激战在城墙上，连拉手榴弹盖的时间都没有。他们就用城墙上的砖块和石头打击敌人。他把战士分成三组，从两侧插下去，展开迂回包围。敌人在我三面火力压制下，狼狈地钻进碉堡。他堵住碉堡门口一梭子冲锋枪，又顺手塞进去几个手榴弹。敌人招架不住了，要求：“不要打啦，交枪了！”接着便从碉堡钻出二十几个俘虏来。这回，他又立了两个大功。
    是战斗英雄又是工作模范，这是李万余同志的特点。他在工作上一贯积极负责。南下时，他是连里革命军人委员会主席。他经常召集各个委员开会，研究各种工作问题。因而在南下途中，革命军人委员会起了很大的作用，部队的群众纪律和伙食都搞的很好。在南下途中，他背两个背包，扛两支枪。一到宿营地，他就烧开水给战士们烫脚，买馒头和鸡蛋给有病的战士吃。他虽累的两眼通红，但工作一点也不放松。部队进到长江北岸评功时，李万余又一次的立了两大功。
    过江后，他调到营部筹粮队工作。他走到那里，首先就向老百姓进行宣传，揭破敌人的欺骗造谣。并亲自帮助老百姓磨谷和送粮。这样，不但胜利的保证了部队的粮食供应，而且还作好了群众工作。因此，他又立了一大功。
    人民的功臣，不是偶然的。李万余同志从参军到现在，是一贯的好。在党的教育培养下，他不断在进步着。现在，他是四二四团三连的副排长。
