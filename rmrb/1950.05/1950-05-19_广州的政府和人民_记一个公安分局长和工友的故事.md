The Government and the People of Guangzhou
　　—A Story of a Public Security Branch Bureau Chief and a Worker
　　Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Xiao Hang

　　The story takes place in mid-February of this year, just four months after the Five-Star Red Flag was raised over Guangzhou, retaining all the characteristics of a newly liberated city.

　　One afternoon, two customers slowly entered a cultural store, discussing "horse ticket" business. Just as the deal was about to be made, the customer's face suddenly turned stern, and the shop assistant was immediately at a loss. Everyone in Guangzhou knew that horse tickets were a kind of gambling tool from Hong Kong, with a term of three months. Each term, several tens of thousands of tickets were sold in Guangzhou, each costing HK$2.20 or $2.30 (the original price of two dollars plus handling fees). If one was lucky enough to win the top prize, one could rake in six or seven hundred thousand Hong Kong dollars. Some people always wanted to try their luck, so there were many people selling horse tickets. Needless to say, this was an illegal activity. The customer criticized the shop assistant. Because he couldn't find the boss at the time, the customer sent a shop assistant named Wen He to the nearby Taiping Branch of the Public Security Bureau to receive some education and change his thinking.

　　In the evening, another shop assistant from the cultural store brought food to the detention center. The person eating wasn't Wen He, but the "head of the inmates"—the person who had been in the detention center the longest. He controlled everything in the left and right cells, which was an old evil practice in Guangzhou. After eating, he took Wen He's mat and sternly told the young man: "Quickly bring me fifteen Hong Kong dollars, then you'll have food to eat, a place to sleep, and you won't be mistreated."

　　The shop assistant who delivered the food returned and found a small note in the food basket, handwritten by Wen He, relaying the instructions of the head of the inmates. Chen, the owner of the cultural store, quickly called Wen Sen—Wen He's older brother, a worker at the White Swan Hotel—and decided to spend some money to "work things out" and get Wen He out. The difficulty was that he couldn't find anyone to use "personal connections" quickly.

　　Wen Sen was very anxious. At the study group meeting, he angrily told others: "My brother has been detained by the Taiping Branch for two days without any interrogation or questioning. The prison is still so corrupt; my brother is suffering, and it's all because the bureau chief hasn't led well. I want to see the bureau chief as a resident of the Taiping District and ask him to make a self-criticism and reform." The workers did not express affirmative opinions. At this time, Wen Sen's thoughts were very complicated. He thought, "Is this the government that serves the people? Is it still so dark, with no benefits at all!" Then he thought again, "The government took over the White Swan Hotel more than a month ago. I have meetings every day, and the cadres often say that if the people have difficulties, they can see Chairman Ye Jianying or write to Chairman Mao. What's wrong with me seeing the bureau chief?" Coincidentally, he met Lin Jiannian, a cadre from the club; he was encouraged and received a letter of introduction from Lin Jiannian, proving that he was a worker at the White Swan. Wen Sen's heart brightened, and he went straight to the Taiping Branch.

　　The person who received him was the bureau chief himself. He explained the whole story and presented a powerful piece of evidence—the small note written by Wen He in the detention center. He asked, "Does the government have an order prohibiting the sale of horse tickets?" This was what Boss Chen had told him. The bureau chief said, "The government has not issued any announcements." Wen Sen asked further, "Is it a crime if it's not illegal?" The bureau chief told him that the matter should be viewed in this way: first, horse tickets are gambling tools, and the government prohibits gambling; second, horse tickets are smuggled from Hong Kong, and if tens of thousands of tickets are sold in Guangzhou, a large amount of our materials will be stolen by the imperialists, which the government naturally will not allow. The bureau chief said, "I know there is an organization selling horse tickets, and I want to find clues from your brother; at the same time, I also want to educate your brother." The bureau chief was very kind and had no airs at all.

　　Wen Sen was not satisfied with this answer. He said, "Yes, selling horse tickets is illegal; it's right to want to find clues from my brother; you can educate my brother for a month or two, and I'd be happy to see that. But you put him in prison and ignored him for two days. The prison extorts money, and he has no food or lodging. So many people live in two small rooms, it's stuffy and smelly, and everyone relieves themselves inside, and no one can stand it!" The bureau chief was somewhat taken aback: "This, this, I didn't know, it must have been done by a lower-level cadre. Please wait a moment, I'll call a cadre over."

　　After a while, a cadre with a pockmarked face came. After the cadre heard the bureau chief's brief summary of the matter, he said, "Originally, we didn't plan to put him in the detention center, but to take him to another room. It must be that the police didn't hear clearly and put him in the wrong place."

　　Wen Sen strongly felt that: bureau chief—cadre—police, pushing the responsibility down layer by layer. He couldn't help it and said, "Bureau chief, no matter what, it's your fault. Even if the police put him in the wrong place, why didn't you interrogate him for two days? I'm willing to tell the bureau chief: you are not from Guangdong, and you just came to the Taiping District, so you don't know the situation here. The prisons in Guangzhou used to be very dark. New prisoners were bullied by old prisoners, and wealthy prisoners could smoke opium and call prostitutes inside, just like in their own homes, doing whatever they wanted. But now, the Taiping District is under your management, and your work hasn't been done well. This may not be your intention, but it's your poor leadership." Wen Sen said very seriously: "I'm here not just for my brother alone. Maybe someone else will go to prison in the future, and they, their families, will be dissatisfied with the government if they see that it's still as corrupt as before. Please investigate and reform immediately." He continued: "The government is no longer the government of the past. Cadres are the servants of the people, as Chairman Mao has instructed. If the people have difficulties, the bureau chief should help them solve them."

　　According to Wen Sen's idea: "This bureau chief must be a Communist Party member!" The bureau chief said to Wen Sen: "You are a worker, with little education, but you have the courage—this courage is class consciousness—to come to the Public Security Bureau and criticize me face to face, which is very good! It's my fault, I didn't handle the matter well. I will solve this problem immediately."

　　After a while, Wen He entered the bureau chief's office with a cadre. When he saw his brother, his eyes were red, and he wanted to cry but didn't dare. No matter how he was persuaded, he wouldn't speak. Wen Sen anxiously said, "You, you're twenty years old, how can you not understand? This is the bureau chief, tell him what's wrong. Otherwise, I won't pay attention to you!" What could he say? His watch, worth more than ten thousand yuan in Renminbi, had been searched away by the head of the inmates, and he had suffered a lot of grievances. However, he told an important thing: "Last night at midnight, more than a dozen inmates were pulling at the iron window bars. After a while, there was a sound of footsteps in the distance, and the patrol came. If it had been an hour later, they would have escaped. Tonight, they plan to escape again."

　　"Really?" The bureau chief said, "If they all escape, my responsibility will be very heavy. But it's good that you reported it to me. I'll have people handle this matter right away." He turned around and told Wen He to return to the detention center, as if nothing had happened, and write another letter to the boss, sending in the fifteen Hong Kong dollars. At the same time, see how much money the policeman who delivers the letter wants. The cadre took out fifteen Hong Kong dollars, recorded the number, and gave it to Wen Sen, asking him to help handle the matter.

　　When Wen He handed the letter to the policeman, he found that this policeman was an old acquaintance of his. Before the policeman could speak, he had already revealed the secret: "You must not take the money, this is what the superiors mean..." The policeman was a smart man, and this time he was willing to run errands for free.

　　The matter was handled well. The bureau chief gathered all the new prisoners together and let Wen He take a look to see who had taken his watch and money, as well as the fifteen Hong Kong dollars. This was naturally not difficult. The bureau chief had the head of the inmates stand out. However, this was a fake head of the inmates, commanded by the head of the inmates hidden behind the scenes. The bureau chief locked them both up together.

　　Wen He was immediately released and accepted the glorious task of assisting in public security work: secretly reporting horse ticket sellers. He did not fail the bureau chief's education and hope, and he fulfilled his obligation as a citizen.

　　The story spread throughout the White Swan Hotel. At a workers' congress, the cadre made a special introduction. However, all the workers insisted that Wen Sen make a report himself. Wen Sen's report ended in applause that resonated throughout the sixth floor.

　　With such a government and such people, we will do our work very well.

　　(In a light rain on April 21st, the reporter visited the Taiping Branch. The bureau chief is named Ma Shaokang. The cadre was originally a staff member of the investigation section. Initially, the Taiping Branch had only two cadres sent there—including Bureau Chief Ma—and the rest were all old personnel, and there were thirty robbery cases every day, and the detention center was always full. Bureau Chief Ma said: "It was my bureaucracy that caused Wen He to suffer grievances." Now, a group of students has joined the work, and the situation in the Taiping Branch has changed greatly.)

### 广州的政府和人民——记一个公安分局长和工友的故事

　　广州的政府和人民
　　——记一个公安分局长和工友的故事
    本报特派记者　萧航
    故事发生在今年二月中旬，五星红旗飘起在广州城头不过四个月，一切保持着新解放城市的特色。
    一天下午，两位顾客慢腾腾地步入文化商店，谈“马票”生意。到了快要成交的时候，顾客的面孔突然一板，店员登时手足无措了。广州人全知道，马票是来自香港的一种赌具，三个月一期，每期在广州都要销售若干万张，每张港币二元二、三角（原价二元加手续费）。凑巧买到头奖，会捞到六、七十万元港币。有些人总想碰碰运气，所以贩卖马票的人很多。不用说，这是一种违法的勾当。顾客批评了店员。因为一时没有找到老板，顾客便把一个名叫温和的店员送到就近的公安局太平分局，受受教育，换换脑筋。
    晚上，文化商店的另一位店员，送饭到拘留所。吃饭的不是温和，却是“监犯头”——住拘留所最久的人。他左右监房的一切，这是广州的旧恶例。他吃罢饭，把温和的席子收过来，厉声地告诉这位年青人：“快点给我拿十五元港币来，那会有你的饭吃，有你的睡处，也不至于怎么受气。”
    送饭的店员回来，发现饭篮里有一张小小的纸条，是温和的亲笔，内中转述了监犯头的吩咐。文化商店的陈老板看了，赶忙打电话把温森——温和的哥哥，白宫酒店的工友找来，决定花些钱“运动运动”，把温和弄出。困难的是急切找不到“人情”。
    温森很着急。在学习小组会上，他火气满大地告诉别人：“我弟弟叫太平分局扣了两天，不审不问。监狱里还是那么腐败；我弟弟很痛苦，这都怨局长没有领导好。我要以太平区居民的身份，见见局长，请他检讨、改革。”工友们并没有表示肯定的意见。这时，温森的思想很复杂。他想：“难道这就是为人民服务的政府吗？还是那么黑暗，没有一点好处！”又反转一想：“政府接管了白宫酒店，已经有一个多月。我天天开会，干部常说，老百姓有了困难，可以见叶剑英主席，还可以给毛主席写信。我见见局长有什么不可以呢？”碰巧，他遇见了俱乐部的干事林健年；他受到了鼓励，并且得到林健年的一封介绍信，证明他是白宫的工友。温森的心里这可亮堂了，迳直去了太平分局。
    接见他的，正是局长本人。他把事情的原委讲了一遍，并且拿出一个有力的证据——温和在拘留所写的那张小小的纸条。他问道：“政府有命令禁止卖马票吗？”这是陈老板告给他的。局长说：“政府没有出过布告。”温森追问了一句：“不犯法就犯罪吗？”局长告诉他，事情应该这样看：第一，马票是赌具，政府禁止赌博；第二，马票是从香港走私来的，如果在广州销售几万张，我们就有好大一批物资被帝国主义者盗取，政府自然不允许。局长说：“我知道贩马票的有个组织，很想从你弟弟身上找找线索；同时，也想教育教育你弟弟。”局长和气极了，一点架子也没有。
    温森对这个回答并不满足。他说：“对，卖马票，犯法；想从我弟弟身上找线索，也应该；你教育我弟弟，一个月、两个月，也可以，我很喜欢。可是，你把他关进了监狱，两天没有理他。监狱里硬使黑钱，他无食无宿。两间不大的房，住了那么多人，又闷又臭，大小便全在里面，谁也受不了呵！”局长有些愕然：“这，这，我并不晓得，一定是下级干部作的。请你等一等，我叫一个干部来。”
    不多会，一位脸上有麻子的干部来了。这个干部听局长简叙了事情的梗概，说道：“本来，没有打算把他关到拘留所，要带到另一间房里去的，一定是警察没听清楚，关错了。”
    温森强烈地感到：局长——干部——警察，一层层地往下推。他忍不住了，说道：“局长，不论怎么样，总是你的不对。就说警察关错了，为什么两天不审问？我愿意告诉局长：你不是广东人，初来太平区，不摸这里的情形。广州的监狱，过去十分黑暗。新犯人要受老犯人的欺负，有钱的犯人，可以在里面吸鸦片，叫妓女，像在自己家里一样，什么也干。可是，现在，太平区是在你的管理下面，你的工作还没有作好，这虽不是你的心愿，却是你领导无方。”温森十分严肃地说：“我来，不单是为了我弟弟一个人，也许以后还会有人进监狱，他们，他们的家属，看到还像早先那样腐败，也会不满意政府。请你马上调查，改革。”他接着说下去：“政府已经不是以前的政府，干部是人民的勤务员，这是毛主席嘱咐过的。人民有了困苦，局长应该帮助解除。”
    据温森的想法：“这位局长，他一定是共产党员！”局长对温森说：“你是一个工人，受教育的时间很短，就有胆量——这胆量就是阶级觉悟——来公安局，当面批评我，很好！错是我的错，事情我没有办好。我马上解决这个问题。”
    一会，温和随着干部进了局长室。一见哥哥，眼圈红红的，想哭又不敢哭。不管怎么劝，总是不讲话。温森着急说：“你，二十岁的人了，思想怎么搞不通？这是局长，有什么事情就讲。要不，我不理你！”他能讲什么呢？他的手表，一万多元的人民币，都教监犯头搜去了，还受了一肚子委屈。不过，他讲了一件重要事情：“昨晚半夜，有十多个监犯拔铁窗。一会，远远地有阵脚步声，巡逻的来了。再迟一个钟头，他们都会跑掉。今晚上，他们打算再跑。”
    “真的吗？”局长说：“他们如果跑光，我的责任很重。可是，你报告了我，很好。我马上教人办这件事情。”他回过头来，又告诉温和，还是回到拘留所，像没有发生过任何事情一样，再写封信给老板，把十五元港币送进来。同时，看看那个送信的警察要多少钱。干部拿出十五元港币，记下了号码，交给温森，请他帮助办这件事情。
    当温和把信交给警察的时候，他发现这位警察是他的老熟人，没等警察开口，他已经泄露了秘密：“你千万别要钱，这是上级的意思……”警察是聪明人，这回情愿白跑腿。
    事情办好了。局长把全部自新人集合起来，让温和看一看，是谁拿走了他的手表和钞票，还有刚才那十五元港币。这自然不费什么事。局长让监犯头站了出来。不过，这是一个假的监犯头，受藏在背后的监犯头指挥。局长把两个人一同关了起来。
    温和马上重获自由，并且接受了协助治安工作的光荣任务：密报马票贩子。他没有辜负了局长的教育和希望，执行了作为一个公民的义务。
    故事传遍了白宫酒店。在一次工友大会上，干部特别作了介绍。但是，全体工友一定请温森亲自作个报告。温森的报告是在响彻六楼的掌声中结束的。
    有这样的政府，这样的人民，我们的事情会办得很好的。
    （四月二十一日微雨中，记者访问了太平分局。局长叫马少康。那个干部，原是侦讯股的干事。最初太平分局，只有两个派去的干部——包括马局长在内，其余的全是旧人员，而抢案日有三十起，拘留所老是满满的。马局长说：“也是我的官僚主义，才使温和受了委屈。”现在，有一批学生参加了工作，太平分局的情形已经大变了。）
