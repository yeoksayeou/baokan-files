Comrade Yu Zhenshan, Inventor of the Slide Rule Algorithm

　　Yu Zhenshan is from Wu'an Village, Qingyuan County, Hebei Province, and comes from a poor peasant background. He is forty-two years old this year. Because his family was very poor, he didn't start elementary school until he was fourteen, supporting his education by carrying water for the school in a work-study program. At that time, he felt a great interest in arithmetic. The encouragement of his teacher further inspired his motivation to research new algorithms. He once said to others:

　　"When I was in elementary school, I felt that addition and subtraction were easy to learn, but multiplication and division required memorizing many formulas first, which was really troublesome. One day I asked Teacher An Dian San: 'Why is arithmetic more important than general subjects?' The teacher said: 'Because the principles of mathematics are profound and widely used, everything in the world is inseparable from mathematics.' I asked again: 'Can we develop a new algorithm that is both simple and easy to learn, and abolish those complicated formulas?' Teacher An said: 'Nothing is difficult in the world if you put your heart into it. As long as you are willing to work hard, you can succeed.' I kept the teacher's words firmly in my heart and decided to research a convenient, simple, and easy-to-learn calculation method."

　　When Yu Zhenshan was nineteen years old, he went to the Northeast for a period and saw many machines, which he found very interesting. So he worked while carefully drawing the patterns and studying them intently. After the "September 18th" Incident broke out, he returned to his hometown within the customs from the Northeast. All the patterns he had painstakingly accumulated in the Northeast for five years were lost. But he was not discouraged by this. He found a second research object, which was the "wooden ox and flowing horse" mentioned in the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms." He felt that the "wooden ox and flowing horse" could help people work, but without consumption. If it could be successfully developed, what a great contribution it would be to the working people! To research the "wooden ox and flowing horse," he began to learn carpentry. Although he mastered carpentry, the research on the "wooden ox and flowing horse" ultimately failed after five years of arduous effort. However, mastering carpentry laid the foundation for his research on new algorithms and new calculation tools.

　　After Yu Zhenshan returned to his hometown from the Northeast, the villagers often asked him to help calculate land area. Because these calculations were very complicated and time-consuming, he felt the urgent need for a new algorithm. Starting in 1936, he began researching new algorithms. In his spare time from farm work, he would hide alone in a small room filled with wooden rulers, wooden boards, paper, pens, and gears of all sizes. He constantly thought carefully and worked hard to experiment. To avoid being disturbed by others, he always locked the door when he went in and out, and the people nearby couldn't figure out what he was doing all day. Once, when the Japanese devils were carrying out a large-scale mopping-up operation, everyone else took their valuables and hid in the tunnels, but he hid with a bundle of wooden rulers, wooden gears, and a preliminary calculator.

　　During the research process, many people in the village ridiculed him, often saying sarcastically: "A farmer carpenter like you, who hasn't gone to college and isn't a mathematics expert, wants to research a new algorithm? Isn't that just messing around! Great scientists all over the world and sages of all ages haven't been able to come up with a method, so how can you do it with your brain?" This ridicule not only did not discourage him but strengthened his firm and unyielding will.

　　In the first five years, Yu Zhenshan created a "wooden calculator." Because of insufficient technology and material conditions, it could not meet the needs, so he continued to study hard. After many failures, he came up with the method of the "center-finding ruler" (a ruler for finding the center line). Finally, in April 1947, with his great determination, confidence, and hard work, he fulfilled his long-cherished wish and successfully created the "slide rule algorithm" for doing calculations with a ruler. First, he made a "square slide rule calculator," and then, based on the "square slide rule calculator," he successively made a "circular slide rule calculator" and a "rectangular slide rule calculator." This "slide rule algorithm" can be used to calculate addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring, square root, land area, acreage, weights, conversions, and proportions without any formulas, and the answer can be obtained at once. It is simple, fast, and easy to learn. Ordinary people can learn to apply it in just two or three hours. Especially for people without a mathematical foundation, it is even more flexible to learn, and they can solve the above problems in a few seconds. Yu Zhenshan called this new algorithm the "Flying Electric Slide Rule Algorithm."

　　Initially, when Yu Zhenshan explained the "Flying Electric Slide Rule Algorithm" to others, people didn't believe him, saying that he "only knew how to recite numbers, how could there be any Flying Electric Slide Rule Algorithm!" In April 1947, he was invited to the Qingyuan County government. In June, the Eighth Brigade of the Third Column Field Army invited him to teach the cadres to use the "slide rule algorithm" to calculate grain coupons and food expenses. Various government agencies and schools invited him to talk about this new algorithm. Later, he was introduced by the Eighth Brigade of the Field Army to the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region People's Government. After many tests, it was proven that what he created was indeed a new calculation method. In November of the same year, the Jizhong Administrative Office, in view of the fact that Yu Zhenshan's "Flying Electric Slide Rule Algorithm" was not only simple and easy to learn but also suitable for practical needs, and that many rural cadres, military personnel, and workers had saved a lot of time and solved many difficulties because of Yu Zhenshan's creation, issued him a certificate of merit and a bonus of 500,000 yuan to reward him, encourage people to continue to create, and promote this new algorithm. The government also renamed the "Flying Electric Slide Rule Algorithm" to the "Yu Zhenshan Slide Rule Algorithm," which was compiled into a book by Comrade An Wenhui and published by the Jin-Cha-Ji Xinhua Bookstore. After that, he continued his research with the reward and help of the Education Department of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region People's Government and the Ministry of Education of the North China People's Government.

　　After the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, the "Yu Zhenshan Slide Rule Algorithm" was also spread to Tianjin and Beijing. Wen Zhizhong, Rong Guanhai, and Chen Zhenwei, three students from Beiyang University in Tianjin, bought a copy of the "Yu Zhenshan Slide Rule Algorithm" and studied it. After Wen Zhizhong used mathematical theory to prove that the "slide rule algorithm" created by this carpenter through diligent research and experimentation completely conformed to the principles of natural logarithms, they wrote an article "Mathematical Research and Improvement of Yu Zhenshan's Rectangular Slide Rule Calculator" and sent it to the Xinhua Bookstore. The Xinhua Bookstore forwarded this article to the Ministry of Education of the North China People's Government. Because Yu Zhenshan's creation far exceeded his theoretical knowledge base, in order to further develop his creative talent, the Ministry of Education of the North China People's Government introduced him to Beiyang University to study and continue his research.

　　Entering university was an unimaginable thing for a working person in the old society. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party and when the people themselves control political power can the people's creative ability be fully developed. As Yu Zhenshan said: "This completely relies on the people's government's cultivation of me. In the past, what way did we farmers have to enter university? Without the people's government, even if we invented something, it would be buried." He also said: "The Beiyang students told me that there are now better slide rules, but the price is too expensive and cannot meet the needs of the masses. My mathematical foundation is very shallow. I hope that the students, professors, teaching assistants… comrades of Beiyang will help me more to improve the 'slide rule algorithm' so that the people can widely use it."

　　After Yu Zhenshan arrived at Beiyang University, he organized the "Yu Zhenshan Slide Rule Algorithm Research Society" with the students. On the one hand, he helped Yu Zhenshan gradually establish a foundation in mathematics and other sciences, and on the other hand, he launched a wave of common learning and common research. Several professors and teaching assistants also joined the ranks of learning and research, on the one hand, engaged in the improvement of the "circular slide rule calculator," and on the other hand, engaged in the expansion of the "Yu Zhenshan slide rule algorithm." Yu Zhenshan also researched and successfully added a "reciprocal scale" to the "square slide rule calculator." It can not only solve continuous multiplication and division problems at once but also solve partial trigonometric function problems, partial binary quadratic simultaneous equations in algebra, partial plane geometry, and land area calculation problems just by tilting the ruler. However, Yu Zhenshan was not satisfied and is still continuing to research in the direction of meeting the needs of the people.

　　Yu Zhenshan has not studied advanced mathematics, nor does he have a good basic scientific knowledge, but the new algorithm he has researched coincides with mathematical theory, which is truly commendable. This precisely shows that the working masses of workers and peasants indeed have infinite wisdom and great creative ability. It also shows that the working masses of workers and peasants lack basic scientific knowledge and cannot but take a tortuous and arduous road in the process of creation. If they are armed with basic scientific knowledge with the help of the people's government and advanced intellectuals, then their creative ability will be even greater!

　　尺算法发明者于振善同志
    于振善是河北省清苑县武安村的人，贫农出身，今年已经四十二岁了。因为家里很穷，十四岁才上小学，靠着给学校担水，这样半工半读的维持读书的费用。那时候他对于算术就感到很大的兴趣。由于老师的鼓励，更启发了他研究新算法的动机。他自己曾对人说过：
    “我在上小学的时候，感觉加减法还好学，可是乘除法还得要先背会很多的口诀，真是太麻烦了。有一天我问安殿三老师：“为什么算术比一般功课重要？”老师说：“因为数学的道理深，用途广，世界上各种事物都离不开数学。”我又问：“我们能不能研究出来一种既简单而且容易学的新算法来，而把那些复杂的口诀废掉？”安老师说：“世上无难事，只怕心不专，只要肯努力研究就能成功。”我就把老师这句话牢牢的记在心里，决定要研究出一个便利而又简单易学的计算方法来。”
    于振善在十九岁的时候，曾经到东北去了一个时期，见到了很多的机器，他非常感觉到兴趣。于是他就一面作工，一面很仔细的把图样画下来潜心研究。“九一八”事变爆发后，他由东北回到关里老家。他在东北五年中所苦心积聚的图样全丢失了。但他并没有因此而灰心，他又找到第二个研究的对象，那就是“三国演义”里面所说的“木牛流马”。他感觉到“木牛流马”可以帮助人作工，可是不需要消耗，如果能获得成功，对于劳动人民的贡献是多么大啊。为了研究“木牛流马”，他开始了学习木匠手艺。木匠手艺虽是学会了，可是“木牛流马”的研究在经过了五年坚苦的努力后终于失败了。但是由于木匠手艺的学成，奠定了他研究新算法、新计算工具的基础。
    于振善由东北回到家乡后，村中人常请他帮忙算地亩。因为这些计算非常复杂费时，他感觉到新算法的迫切需要。从一九三六年起开始了新算法的研究，在作庄稼活空闲的时候，他就一个人躲在一间小屋子里，那屋里堆满了木尺、木板、纸、笔和大大小小的齿轮。他不断的仔细的思考，努力的试验。为避免别人扰乱，他出入总是锁着门，附近的人们也摸不清他整天在搞些什么鬼。有一次日本鬼子大扫荡，人家都带着贵重的东西躲到地洞里去，他却抱着一抱木尺、木制的齿轮和初步制成的计算器躲开了。
    在研究的过程中，村中有很多人嘲笑他，常用讽刺的口吻说：“像你这样的庄稼木匠，既没有上过大学，又不是什么算学专家，想要研究什么新算法，那不是瞎胡闹吗！全世界的大科学家，历代的圣人都没有能想出方法来，就凭你这付脑袋，行么？”这种讥笑非但没有使他灰心，反而更加强了他的坚定不拔的意志。
    于振善在最初的五年里，造成了一种“木质计算器”，因为技术方面及物质条件的不足，不能适合需要，他又继续苦心的研究，经过了多少次的失败，又想出“取中尺”（这是一种找中线的尺子）的方法。最后终于在一九四七年的四月，在他的极大的决心、信心及坚苦的努力下完成了他的夙愿，创造成功了用尺子来算账的“尺算法”。首先他制成了“方形尺算器”，又以“方形尺算器”为基础相继制成了“圆形尺算器”和“长形尺算器”。这种“尺算法”对于加、减、乘、除、平方、开方、地亩、面积、斤两、折合以及比例等问题的计算，都可以不用任何口诀，一次求出，既简便迅速而且易学，普通人只要用上两三个钟点即可学会应用。尤其是没有数学基础的人，学会了运用更为灵活，用不了几秒钟即可解决上述的问题。于振善就把这种新算法称为“飞电尺算法”。
    在最初，于振善把“飞电尺算法”讲给别人听时，人家不相信，说他“只会背数目字，那里有什么飞电尺算法！”在一九四七年的四月，他就被请到清苑县政府去。六月，第三纵队野战第八旅请他去教干部们用“尺算法”计算粮票菜金，各地机关学校都请他去讲这新算法。后来由野战八旅介绍到晋察冀边区人民政府。经过了许多次的考验，证明了他所创造的确是一种新的计算方法。在同年十一月间，冀中行政公署鉴于于振善的“飞电尺算法”不但简便易学，而且适合实际的需要。许多农村干部、军队人员及职工们都因为于振善的创造而省下了许多时间，解决了许多困难。为了奖励他，并鼓励人民的继续创造，及推广这一新的算法，政府发给他奖状一纸，奖金五十万元，并且把这“飞电尺算法”更名为“于振善尺算法”，由安文辉同志编著成书，由晋察冀新华书店出版。此后他就在晋察冀边区人民政府教育处和华北人民政府教育部的奖励与帮助下继续研究。
    平津解放后，“于振善尺算法”也传到了平津。天津北洋大学学生闻致中、容观海、陈镇威等三人，买了一本“于振善尺算法”，加以研究。经闻致中用数学理论证明了这位木匠凭努力钻研试验所创造的“尺算法”完全符合于自然对数的原理，于是他们写了一篇“于振善长形尺算器的数理研究及其改进”，寄到新华书店去。新华书店便将这篇文章转到华北人民政府教育部。因为于振善的创造远超过他的理论知识基础，为了进一步发挥他的创造天才，华北人民政府教育部便介绍他到北洋大学去学习，并继续研究。
    进大学，这在旧社会里，对于一个劳动人民来说，实在是不可想像的事。只有在共产党的领导下，人民自己掌握政权的时候，人民的创造能力才能得到充分的发挥。正如于振善所说的：“这完全靠人民政府对咱的培养，在从前我们农民有啥法子进大学？没有人民的政府就是发明了东西也是要被埋没的。”他又说：“北洋同学告诉我现在有更好的计算尺，但是价钱贵不能适应群众的需要。我的数学根底很浅，希望北洋的同学、教授、助教……同志们多帮助我，把“尺算法”改进得更好，使人民群众能够广泛的应用”。
    于振善到北洋大学后即和同学们组织了“于振善尺算法研究社”，一方面帮助于振善逐渐建立起数学及其他科学方面的基础，一方面展开了共同学习共同研究的热潮。几位教授和助教亦加入了学习研究的行列，一方面从事“圆形尺算器”的改进，一方面从事“于振善尺算法”的扩编。于振善在北洋又研究在“方形尺算器”上增添“倒数尺”，获得了成功。它不但能把乘除连算，连乘连除等问题一次求出，而且对于部分的三角函数问题，代数上部分的二元二次联立方程式，部分平面几何和土地截亩等问题只要把尺一斜，即可立时求出。但于振善并没有满足，仍在继续向着适合人民群众需要的方向研究中。
    于振善没有学过高深的数学，同时也没有很好的科学知识基础，但是他所研究出来的新算法却与数学的理论不谋而合，真是难能可贵的事。这正说是明了工农劳动群众的确有着无穷的智慧和伟大的创造能力。同时也说明了工农劳动群众缺乏基本的科学知识，在创造的过程中不能不走着曲折而艰苦的道路，如果他们在人民政府和先进知识分子的帮助下，获得了基本科学知识的武装，那么他们的创造能力将会有更大的发挥！
