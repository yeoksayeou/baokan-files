　　A Cry from an Orphan
　　Dear peace-loving fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, and loved ones:
　　The world peace signature campaign has been enthusiastically launched in every corner of the world. I am a nineteen-year-old youth. In 1937, the guns of Japanese imperialism killed my father on the banks of the Huangpu River; in 1947, the Kuomintang reactionaries killed my mother with American-made bombs in northern Anhui. From that moment on, I became an orphan who had lost his parents.
　　This is not just my personal misfortune in the war. I don't know how many people were deprived of their parents, husbands, wives, and loved ones by Japanese imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang.
　　Now, the aggressive bloc headed by American imperialism—the rabid warmongers—are actively preparing for a new war, attempting to drag the democratic countries that are engaged in peaceful construction into the flames of war, and trying to use the "terror of the atomic bomb" to threaten human peace.
　　Compatriots! We need peace, and we resolutely defend peace! Our parents, brothers, sisters, husbands, wives, loved ones, children, and all peace-loving people in the world will never allow the imperialists to continue their evil deeds. We must actively sign the "Peace Appeal" and tell the people of the world our will and determination. We must demonstrate to the imperialists with the peace signature campaign, so that those crazy warmongers tremble before the peace-loving people!

　　一个孤儿的呼声
    爱群爱好和平的爸爸、妈妈、哥哥、弟弟、姐姐、妹妹们：
    保卫世界和平的和平签名运动已经在世界的各个角落热烈的展开。我是一个十九岁的青年，一九三七年日本帝国主义的枪炮，在黄浦江畔杀死了我的爸爸；一九四七年国民党反动派又以美造炸弹在皖北炸死了我的母亲。从这个时候起，我就成了一个失掉了父母的孤儿。
    这不仅是我一个人在战争中所遭遇的不幸，不知道有多少人被日本帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮夺去了父母、丈夫、妻子和爱人。
    现在，以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团——丧心病狂的战争贩子们，又在积极地准备新的战争，妄图把正在进行和平建设的民主国家推入战火里面，想用“原子弹的恐怖”来威胁人类的和平。
    同胞们！我们需要和平，我们坚决保卫和平！我们的父母、兄弟、姐妹、丈夫、妻子、爱人、儿女，及世界上一切爱好和平的人民，决不容许帝国主义者继续逞凶。我们要踊跃地在“和平呼吁书”上签名，把我们的意志与决心告诉全世界人民。我们要以和平签名运动向帝国主义者示威，使那些疯狂的战争贩子们在爱好和平的人民面前发抖！
