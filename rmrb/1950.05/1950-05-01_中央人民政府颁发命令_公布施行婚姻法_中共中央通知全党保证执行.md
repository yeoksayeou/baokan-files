    The Central People's Government Issues Order to Promulgate and Implement the Marriage Law
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China Notifies the Entire Party to Guarantee Implementation
    [Xinhua News Agency, 30th] The Central People's Government issued an order today, promulgating and implementing the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China (the full text of the law was published by this agency on April 14th). The full text of the order is as follows:
    The Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China, passed by the Seventh Meeting of the Central People's Government Committee, shall be promulgated and implemented from May 1, 1950. From the date of promulgation, all temporary regulations and decrees concerning marriage issues previously promulgated in the liberated areas shall be abolished. This order.

     Chairman Mao Zedong
    April 30, 1950
    [Xinhua News Agency, 30th] The full text of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's notice to the entire party on guaranteeing the implementation of the Marriage Law is as follows: To all levels of Party committees and all Party comrades:

    The Central People's Government has issued a clear order to promulgate the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China on May 1st. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China fully agrees with this Marriage Law, and all members of our Party should unanimously support and abide by it. The correct implementation of the Marriage Law will not only liberate the masses of Chinese men and women—especially women—from the barbaric and backward old marriage system of thousands of years, but also establish a new marriage system, new family relationships, new social life, and new social ethics, so as to promote the development of political, economic, cultural, and defense construction of New Democratic China. Therefore, all Party comrades should earnestly study the Marriage Law and guarantee its correct implementation. Party committees at all levels must especially adopt appropriate measures to mobilize and organize Party members to conduct educational work among the broad masses to publicize and explain the Marriage Law, so that the Marriage Law becomes a legal document that is known to every household and willingly implemented by the masses. Communist Party members who work directly in the marriage registration organs and judicial organs of the People's Government, as well as Communist Party members who work in women's organizations and youth organizations, should play an active role in the work of publicizing and implementing the Marriage Law. Within the Party, there are some Party members, especially some Party members who work in district and township governments, and even individual Party members who work in lower-level judicial organs, who, influenced by feudal ideas, or who, towards the illegal acts of interfering with the freedom of marriage between men and women, and abusing women and abusing children among some of the masses, adopt an attitude of standing idly by; and thus fail to give the interferers and abusers the legal sanctions and ideological education they deserve according to the law, and to give the interfered and abused the legal protection and factual protection they deserve; or even sometimes commit illegal acts of interfering with the freedom of marriage between men and women themselves. These are all wrong. Party committees at all levels must be responsible for carrying out systematic persuasive education work related to the implementation of the Marriage Law; to raise the political consciousness of Communist Party members and the people, so that they actively implement the policies of the Party and the People's Government against the feudal marriage system and implement the new democratic marriage system, so that the staff of the People's Government, whether in marriage registration work or in the mediation and adjudication of marriage cases, adopt a responsible attitude of being serious and cautious, investigating and studying, and resolving problems reasonably and legally; and are able to stand on the correct position in opposing all acts of oppression, abuse, and insult of women and protecting the legitimate interests of women. At the same time, Communist Party members should be made to understand: if a Communist Party member has an act of interfering with the freedom of marriage between men and women, and an act of causing injury or death to the interfered party as a result of interfering with the freedom of marriage, he will not only be liable for civil and criminal responsibilities and be subject to state legal sanctions, but will first be subject to Party disciplinary sanctions. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China requires Party committees at all levels and all Party members to regard the publicity work and organizational work of ensuring the correct implementation of the Marriage Law as one of the current and regular important tasks.

　　中央人民政府颁发命令
    公布施行婚姻法
    中共中央通知全党保证执行
    【新华社三十日讯】中央人民政府本日颁发命令，公布施行中华人民共和国婚姻法（按该法全文已由本社于四月十四日发表）。命令全文如下：
    中央人民政府委员会第七次会议通过的中华人民共和国婚姻法，应自一九五○年五月一日起公布施行。自公布之日起，所有以前各解放区颁布的有关婚姻问题的一切暂行的条例和法令均予废止。此令。
     主席  毛泽东
    一九五○年四月三十日
    【新华社三十日讯】中共中央关于保证执行婚姻法给全党的通知，全文如下：各级党委和全党同志们：
    中央人民政府已明令于五月一日公布中华人民共和国婚姻法。中共中央委员会完全同意这一婚姻法，我党全体党员应一致拥护与遵守这一婚姻法。正确地实行婚姻法，不仅将使中国男女群众——尤其是妇女群众，从几千年野蛮落后的旧婚姻制度下解放出来，而且可以建立新的婚姻制度、新的家庭关系、新的社会生活和新的社会道德，以促进新民主主义中国的政治建设、经济建设、文化建设和国防建设的发展。因此，全党同志应认真研究婚姻法，保证予以正确执行。各级党委尤须采取适当办法，动员和组织党员向广大群众作宣传解释婚姻法的教育工作，使婚姻法成为群众中家喻户晓乐意执行的法律文件。而直接在人民政府婚姻登记机关和司法机关中工作的共产党员，以及在妇女团体和青年团体中工作的共产党员，更应在宣传和执行婚姻法工作中起积极的作用。在党内有一部分党员，特别是担任区乡政府工作中的某些党员，甚至少数下级司法机关工作中的个别党员，由于受了封建意识的影响，或者对一部分群众中干涉男女婚姻自由和虐待妇女以及虐待子女等非法行为，采取袖手旁观的态度；因而未能依法给干涉者和虐待者以应有的法律制裁和思想教育，并给被干涉者和被虐待者以应有的法律保护和事实保护；或者甚至本身有时也作出干涉男女婚姻自由的非法行为。这些都是不对的。各级党委必须负责进行有关执行婚姻法的有系统的说服教育工作；提高共产党员和人民群众的政治觉悟，使他们积极起来执行党和人民政府反对封建主义婚姻制度和实行新民主主义婚姻制度的政策，使人民政府的工作人员无论在婚姻登记工作方面，无论在婚姻案件的调解和判决工作方面，都采取严肃慎重调查研究合情合理解决问题的负责态度；而在反对一切压迫虐待侮辱妇女行为和保护妇女合法利益方面，能够站在正确的立场上。同时，应使共产党员们明白认识：如果共产党员有干涉男女婚姻自由行为以及因干涉婚姻自由而造成被干涉者的伤害或死亡的行为，将不仅应负民事的和刑事的责任而受到国家的法律制裁，并且首先将受到党的纪律制裁。中共中央要求各级党委和全体党员，把保证婚姻法正确执行的宣传工作和组织工作，当作目前的和经常的重要工作任务之一。
    中国共产党中央委员会    一九五○年四月三十日
