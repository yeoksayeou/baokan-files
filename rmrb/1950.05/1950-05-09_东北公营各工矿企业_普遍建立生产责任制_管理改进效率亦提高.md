Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 5th. Since the universal establishment of the production responsibility system in the Northeast's publicly owned industrial and mining enterprises, enterprise management has been considerably improved. In the past two months, all enterprises have regarded this work as an important step in improving production management, mobilizing the masses of workers to launch democratic inspection campaigns, exposing many phenomena of no one being responsible and the associated slack discipline; and focusing on research, formulating various systems and working rules, or revising and improving existing systems and rules, thereby clarifying the scope of work and responsibilities, and improving work efficiency. In the past, the open-hearth furnace of the Experimental Factory of the Mechanical Engineering Bureau frequently experienced failures, affecting the failure to complete the production tasks every month from November last year to January this year. After the establishment of the responsibility system in February, not only were the production tasks for February and March completed on schedule, but also the shortfall in January was made up, and the production plan for the first quarter was completed. After strengthening the inspection system for semi-finished products at the Shenyang Rubber Factory No. 6, workers paid more attention to product quality, and the first-class product rate reached 99% in March. After establishing a mobile inspection system at the Fifth Electric Appliance Factory of the Electrical Industry Bureau, the phenomenon of shutdowns due to motor damage, which used to be common, was eliminated in March. When establishing and strengthening the responsibility system, some workers felt restricted by it. For example, a worker at the Shenyang Smelting Plant reflected: "I would rather do more work than be held responsible." However, many factory and mine leaders currently lack sufficient attention to establishing the responsibility system, often emphasizing that administrative work is busy and there is no time for meetings, formulating systems rashly, and not ensuring that cadres and workers have a clear understanding, resulting in formalism again. Some factories and mines also fail to grasp the key issues in current production and establish systems with a focus, resulting in little gain. To this end, in addition to calling on all factories and mines to exchange experiences, the Industry Department of the Northeast People's Government emphasizes focusing on establishing a production safety responsibility system, mobilizing all workers to use their hands and brains, eliminating all liability accidents, and then gradually establishing various responsibility systems.

　　东北公营各工矿企业
    普遍建立生产责任制
    管理改进效率亦提高
    【新华社沈阳五日电】东北公营各工矿企业自从普遍建立生产责任制以来，已使企业管理工作有了相当改进。最近两个月来，各企业都把这一工作，当作改进生产管理的重要步骤，发动职工群众开展民主的检查运动，揭发了许多无人负责以及与此相关联的纪律松懈等现象；并有重点地加以研究，制订成各种制度和工作细则，或将已有的制度和细则加以修正改进，从而使工作范围和职责明确具体，提高了工作效率。机械管理局实验厂过去平炉经常发生故障，影响到去年十一月至今年一月每月都未完成生产任务。二月份建立了责任制后，不仅二、三月份生产任务按期完成，并补足了一月份所欠差额，完成了第一季度的生产计划。沈阳橡胶六厂在加强了对半成品的检查制度后，工人对产品质量更加注意，三月份一等品即达到百分之九十九。电器工业管理局第五电器厂建立了流动检查后，三月份便消灭了过去常因电动机损坏而停工的现象。各厂矿在建立与加强责任制时，曾有部分职工觉得因此受到拘束。如沈阳冶炼厂某工友即反映：“宁愿多干些活，可不要叫我负责任。”而不少厂矿的领导人员目前对建立责任制度仍缺乏足够的注意，往往强调行政工作忙、没有时间开会，轻率地制订制度，不管干部与职工是否认识清楚，致又流于形式。也有的厂矿抓不住当前生产上的关键问题而有重点地建立制度，结果收获不大。为此，东北人民政府工业部除号召各厂矿互相交流经验外，强调以建立生产安全责任制为重点，发动所有职工动手动脑，消灭一切责任事故，进而逐步建立各种责任制度。
