Xinhua News Agency report: Speech by Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Committee for the Defense of World Peace, at the Beijing Rally for the World Peace Declaration Signature Campaign. The full text is as follows:

Representatives from all walks of life in Beijing!

Our China Committee for the Defense of World Peace, in response to the call of the Third Plenary Session of the Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress, is holding today's grand rally to sign the appeal to ban atomic weapons. Seeing such enthusiastic participation from representatives of all walks of life, we must first express our congratulations on the grand unfolding of the movement to defend world peace.

The World Peace Congress was jointly organized in Paris and Prague last April by representatives from seventy-two countries, and it has been a full year now. In this year, the movement to defend world peace has made great progress. Eighty-one countries around the world have organizations for the defense of world peace, of which fifty-two countries have established national peace committees, and some countries have held as many as twenty-seven peace conferences. More than one billion peace-loving people around the world have been involved in this great struggle for peace.

What does such a great development signify? It shows that the people of the world—regardless of gender, age, or race—urgently need peace, and at the same time, it also indicates that world peace is indeed under significant threat.

Representatives, the world has been divided into two distinct camps: one is the peace camp led by the Soviet Union, and the other is the aggressive camp led by U.S. imperialism. This aggressive camp is the source of the threat to world peace today.

U.S. imperialism fattened itself by eating human blood in the two world wars, and after the end of the Second World War, it frantically organized new wars. The sheer size of its military budget is good proof of this.

The U.S. imperialist's military budget for this year accounts for more than two-thirds of the total budget, or 68 percent. The budget for the year starting from July 1st of this year is currently being discussed in the U.S. Congress, and military spending will increase by another 350 million U.S. dollars, accounting for three-quarters of the total budget, or 76 percent.

Such a frenzied increase in military budgets, frenzied expansion of military bases, frenzied encouragement of weapons manufacturing, and frenzied organization of backward elements around the world to oppose progressive humanity undoubtedly mean that the crisis of a new war does indeed exist.

Representatives, the discovery and utilization of atomic energy was originally the highest achievement of human cultural development to this day. If we could utilize it in production, it is unknown how many times it would raise the level of human production and the level of human life. Unfortunately, the U.S. imperialists have used it to manufacture weapons for killing people.

The U.S. imperialists once thought they had a monopoly on the secret of atomic weapons and raised the atomic bomb to frighten progressive humanity around the world. Truman of the United States once shamelessly boasted that the U.S. imperialists had atomic bombs as a "divine gift." That is to say, he was ordered by God to massacre humanity on a large scale. Look, how majestic is this "great hero" from a drugstore clerk background! But who is his God? The big bank bosses of Wall Street! Recently, this little clerk boasted again. On the 10th of this month, he publicly declared to the American public that he had made a contribution by dropping two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan, saving the lives of Japanese soldiers. Yes, and also saving the lives of countless innocent citizens of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, including countless children and women, and saving them all to the Kingdom of Heaven. This little clerk is so openly arrogant, he does not hide the fact that he plans to drop another atomic bomb!

We would like to write a few hymns to praise this "great hero":

“Mr. Truman, amazing Mr. Truman!

You are the culmination of fascism!

The atomic bomb in your hand is truly ‘sacred,’ ‘sacred,’ and thrice ‘sacred,’

Decorating your golden body with the skulls of thousands upon thousands of people.

You have three times the glory of Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo Hideki.

——Do you plan to drop another atomic bomb?

O.K. O.K. If you drop another atomic bomb,

We will crown you as the new Trinity—war criminal.”

Indeed, we must clearly declare: whoever uses the atomic bomb as an offensive weapon, as a weapon of mass destruction of mankind, is a war criminal! This is the gist of the appeal issued by the Stockholm Conference of the World Peace Congress in mid-March of this year, and it is also the main task of our signature rally today.

Representatives, after the World Peace Congress issued the appeal, there was a universal response around the world, and the signature campaign has been launched enthusiastically in various countries. Eastern Germany alone has had 10 million signatures, and Romania has had 7 million. China has a large population, and the whole world is watching us. We should work hard to mobilize.

Our China Committee for the Defense of World Peace accepted the appeal of the World Peace Congress and issued a notice on April 28, requesting all sectors of society across the country to sign universally. All sectors of society across the country have responded enthusiastically. Shanghai alone has set a target of one million people, which may be exceeded in the future.

The various agencies and schools in Beijing have already conducted separate signatures. Some agencies have linked the signature campaign with internationalist education. For example, the Ministry of Trade has decided to hold a study week on the movement to defend world peace starting tomorrow, to study the literature of the peace movement, and finally to hold a conference for signatures. Such planned and organized promotion is a good example.

At today's conference, we can only hold a representative signing ceremony. We ask each agency and group to recommend ten representatives to come on stage to sign. After the conference, we ask the representatives of each agency and group to return to their units to widely disseminate the message and widely launch the signature campaign in their respective units.

Representatives, our signature rally is an international movement, and we must have a clear understanding of this movement.

Our signing of this appeal is a warning to the war-mongers in the aggressive camp. We are not seeking peace with them, but demonstrating to them. Please be a little more sober, a little more aware, and see what happened to the fascist imperialist countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan? See where Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo Hideki, the "great heroes," are today?

Our signing of this appeal is our oath to defend peace. Peace can only be won at a great price, and peace can only be defended with great preparation. The Chinese people should know very well that in order to win today's basic peace, we have fought a bloody struggle against imperialism and its running dogs for more than a hundred years. We must make greater efforts and more active preparations to defend the peace we have already won.

Representatives, although the imperialists are frantically preparing for war, we must not be intimidated by them. That is just a necessary final struggle on the road to ruin. The decline of imperialism is irreversible. In the past thirty years, several powerful imperialisms have been eliminated in the world. Britain and France are now, in fact, appendages of U.S. imperialism. And what is the situation in the United States? The level of production is constantly declining, the number of unemployed workers is constantly increasing, and a serious economic crisis is constantly approaching. In fact, it is these internal contradictions that are forcing the U.S. imperialists to become more and more alarmed, more and more out of control, and more and more inclined to drink poison to quench their thirst.

They are already trembling in the face of the growing forces of peace. They are preventing peace delegations from the World Peace Congress from entering their countries, suppressing domestic peace movements, and persecuting progressive pro-peace scientists and artists. They are simply suffering from peace phobia.

Representatives, the crisis of war certainly exists, but the crisis of war can be overcome. As long as we are constantly vigilant, constantly unite ourselves, organize ourselves, and constantly disintegrate the enemy and weaken the enemy, we are confident that we can overcome the crisis of war.

Atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs are not terrible, extensive military bases are not terrible, huge military budgets are not terrible, only the power of the people is the greatest power.

The Chinese people have ample experience. May I ask: Three or four years ago, did not the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, fully supported by U.S. imperialism, have more weapons than us, more bases than us, and more military spending than us? But what is the situation today? Hasn't Chiang Kai-shek become a transport captain, and hasn't U.S. imperialism become our People's Liberation Army's arsenal?

If Truman is willing to be the world's transport captain again today, we can give him an appointment.

The Chinese people have ample experience. The Chinese people, united around the great leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party, who are fighting for peace for the people, have great strength because we have strong unity and correct leadership, and thus defeated U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

Today, the forces of democracy and peace throughout the world have been further expanded. We have the strong peace fortress of the Soviet Union as our leader, eleven fraternal countries of new democracy closely united, and more than one billion people around the world supporting peace. And we must continue to expand and consolidate our unity. This is an invincible great force of the people. This is many times more powerful than any atomic bomb or hydrogen bomb.

It is time for the imperialists to learn some lessons. If they do not learn their lessons, they will have the opportunity to receive the angry sanctions of the people of the world, just like Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo Hideki!

Finally, we can resolutely declare:

If imperialism dares to launch a war, imperialism is preparing to hold its last cremation!

### 中国保卫世界和平大会委员会主席郭沫若　在北京保卫世界和平签名运动大会上的讲演

　　在北京保卫世界和平签名运动大会上的讲演
    【新华社讯】中国保卫世界和平大会委员会主席郭沫若在北京市保卫世界和平宣言签名运动大会上的讲演，全文如下：北京市各界的代表们！
    我们中国保卫世界和平大会委员会，为了响应世界拥护和平大会常设委员会第三次全会的号召，要在禁止原子武器的呼吁书上签名，特别隆重地召开了今天的大会。看到各界代表这样热烈地参加，我们首先要为保卫世界和平运动的盛大展开，表示庆贺。
    世界拥护和平大会是去年四月在巴黎和布拉格由七十二个国家的代表所共同组织的，到现在整整一年了。在这一年当中，保卫世界和平的运动有了很大的发展。全世界有八十一个国家已经有了保卫世界和平运动的组织，其中有五十二个国家成立了全国和平委员会，有的国家已经召开过二十七次的和平大会。全世界爱好和平的人民已经有十万万以上的人数卷入了这一争取和平的伟大斗争。
    这样伟大的发展表示着什么呢？这就表示着全世界的人民——不分男女老少、不分种族派别——都迫切地需要和平，而同时在反面上也就表示着世界和平的确是受着显著的威胁。
    各位代表，世界已经分成了两个壁垒鲜明的阵营：一边是以苏联为首的和平阵营，另一边是以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营。这侵略阵营便是我们今天世界和平所受着的威胁的来源。
    美帝国主义是在两次大战中靠着吃人血养肥了，在第二次大战结束之后便疯狂地组织着新的战争。单拿军事预算的庞大一点来说已就是很好的证明了。
    美帝国主义本年度的军事预算，占全部预算的三分之二以上，即百分之六十八。从本年七月一日起来年度的预算，目前在美国国会中正在讨论着，军费还要增加三亿五千万美元，要占全部预算的四分之三，即百分之七十六。
    像这样疯狂地增加军事预算，疯狂地扩充军事基地，疯狂地鼓励武器制造，疯狂地组织全世界的落后分子来和进步的人类敌对，毫无疑问，新战争的危机的确是存在着。
    各位代表，原子能的发现和利用，本来是人类文化发展到今天的最高的成就。假如我们能够利用到生产方面，那不知道会使人类的生产水平、人类的生活水平提高到多少倍。但不幸被美帝国主义者把它利用到杀人武器的制造上去了。
    美国帝国主义者曾经有一个时期自以为是原子武器秘密的独占者，高举起原子弹向全世界进步人类唬骇。美国的杜鲁门曾经大言不惭地这样夸示过：美帝国主义有原子弹是“神圣的付与”。这就是说，他是奉了上帝的命令来大规模屠杀人类的。请看，这位药店小伙计出身的“大豪杰”好不威风！但是他的上帝是什么呢？华尔街的大银行老板罢了！最近这位小伙计又在丑表功了，本月十日他竟公开地向美国的公众声明：他在日本的广岛和长崎投了两枚原子弹有了功劳，他打救了日本士兵的生命。是的，还打救了广岛和长崎的无数无辜的市民，包含着无数的儿童和妇女，把他们一股脑儿打救进天国里去了。这位小伙计竟公然狂妄到了这样的程度，他毫不掩饰地说：他打算再投一次原子弹！
    我们倒想做几句赞美诗来歌颂这位“大豪杰”了：
    “杜鲁门先生，了不起的杜鲁门先生！
    你是法西斯蒂的集大成！
    你手里的原子弹真是‘神圣’，‘神圣’，第三个‘神圣’，
    把成千成万的人头骷髅装饰着你的金身。
    你有希特勒、墨索里尼、东条英机三倍的光荣。
    ——你打算再投一次原子炸弹吗？
    Ｏ·Ｋ·Ｏ·Ｋ·你如果再投一次原子炸弹，
    我们就封你为新的三位一体——战争罪犯。”
    的确的，我们要明朗地宣告：谁要是作为侵略武器，作为大规模毁灭人类的武器来使用原子炸弹，谁就是战争罪犯！这就是今年三月中旬世界拥护和平大会斯德哥尔摩会议所发出的呼吁书的要点，也就是我们今天召开这次签名大会的主要任务。
    各界代表们，世界拥护和平大会发出了呼吁书以后，全世界有了普遍的响应，签名运动已经在世界各国热烈地展开。单是东德已经有一千万人签名，罗马尼亚已经有七百万人。我们中国的人口多，全世界都在注视着我们，我们是应该努力发动的。
    我们中国保卫世界和平大会委员会接受了世界拥护和平大会的呼吁书后，已经在四月二十八日发出了通告，要求全国各界普遍地签名。全国各界已有了热烈的响应，单是上海一市便预定以一百万人为目标，将来可能还要超过的。
    北京的各机关学校已经早已分别进行签名，有的机关更和签名运动联系起来，进行了国际主义的教育。例如贸易部便已经决定从明天起举行保卫世界和平运动的学习周，学习和平运动的文献，最后再召开大会进行签名。这样有计划有组织的推动是很好的例子。
    在今天大会场上我们是只能够举行代表性的签名式的，我们请求各机关各团体推举十位代表上台签名。在大会后请求各机关各团体的代表回到本单位去作广泛的传达，在各自的单位里把签名运动广泛地展开。
    各位代表，我们的签名大会是一种国际性的运动，我们对于这一运动还须得加以明确的认识。
    我们在这呼吁书上签名，这是对侵略阵营的战争贩子们的一个警告。我们不是向他们求和，而是向他们示威。请他们稍微清醒一点，觉悟一点，看看德意志、意大利、日本那几个法西斯帝国主义国家是怎么样了？看看希特勒、墨索里尼、东条英机那几位“大豪杰”，今天是在什么地方？
    我们在这呼吁书上签名，这是我们对于保卫和平的宣誓。和平是要费很大的代价才能够争取得到，和平是要有很大的准备才能够保卫得着的。我们中国人民应该知道得很清楚，我们为了争取到今天的基本上的和平，对于帝国主义和它的走狗们，已经作了一百年以上的流血斗争。我们还要作更大的努力，更积极的准备，来保卫我们所已经争取到的和平。
    各位代表，帝国主义者尽管疯狂备战，但我们不要为它所骇倒。那只是走向末路的一种必然的最后挣扎罢了。帝国主义的没落是无可挽救的。在最近三十几年中世界上已经消灭了好几个强大的帝国主义了。现在的英国法国事实上已经成为美帝国主义的附庸。就是美帝国的情形又是怎样呢？生产水平不断地下降，工人失业者不断地增加，严重的经济危机不断地迫近，事实上也就是这些内在的矛盾逼迫着美帝国主义者一天一天的惊惶失措，一天一天的失掉控制，一天一天的想饮鸩止渴。
    他们已经在壮大的和平力量面前发抖了。它们阻止世界拥护和平大会的和平代表团入境，镇压国内的和平运动，迫害进步的拥护和平的科学家、艺术家，它们简直是害了和平恐怖症了。
    各位代表，战争的危机诚然是存在，但战争的危机是能够克服的。只要我们不断地警惕着，不断地团结自己，组织自己，不断地瓦解敌人，削弱敌人，我们是有把握来克服战争的危机的。
    原子弹，氢气弹并不可怕，广泛的军事基地并不可怕，庞大的军事预算并不可怕，只有人民的力量才是最伟大的力量。
    我们中国人民是有充分的经验的。请问：三四年前美帝国主义所全力支持的蒋介石匪帮，他的武器不是多过我们，基地不是多过我们，军费不是多过我们吗？然而今天怎样了？蒋介石不是当了运输大队长，美帝国主义不是当了我们人民解放军的兵工厂吗？
    今天杜鲁门假使又愿意做全世界的运输大队长的话，我们可以给他一个委任状。
    我们中国人民是有充分的经验的。我们中国人民团结在为人民争取和平的伟大领袖毛主席和中国共产党周围，由于我们有了坚强的团结，有了正确的领导，便有了伟大的力量，因而打败了美帝国主义和它的走狗。
    今天我们全世界民主和平的力量是更加扩大了。我们有坚强的和平堡垒苏联作为领导，有十一个新民主主义的兄弟国家亲密地团结，有十万万人以上拥护和平的人民普遍于全世界，而且我们还要不断地更加扩大并巩固我们的团结呢。这是不可战胜的一个伟大的人民力量。这比任何原子弹、氢气弹的威力要大到无数倍。
    是帝国主义者们多少接受些教训的时候了，要是始终不接受教训，它们尽有机会像希特勒、墨索里尼、东条英机一样，领受全世界人民的愤怒的制裁！
    最后我们可以坚决地这样宣告：
    帝国主义如果敢于发动战争，帝国主义是准备着举行最后一次的火葬！
